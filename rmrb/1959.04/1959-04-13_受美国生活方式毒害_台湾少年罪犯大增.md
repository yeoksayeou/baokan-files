Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: Taiwan newspapers report that Mei Ke-wang, the Education Director of the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Central Police Academy," said on April 6th that juvenile criminal problems in Taiwan are extremely serious. In 1953, the number of recorded juvenile crimes in Taiwan was 1,922, which increased to 5,874 in 1957, an increase of two times in four years. Last year was clearly a significant increase over 1957. Mei Ke-wang said that many juvenile crimes are very serious, and the scope of crimes includes murder, robbery, drug abuse, drug trafficking, theft, insulting women, and so on. Among the juvenile offenders, there are even children under the age of twelve. Mei Ke-wang admitted that the current surging wave of juvenile crime is rapidly affecting and corrupting Taiwan's next generation.

Many messages published in Taiwan newspapers indicate that the increasing severity of Taiwan's juvenile crime problem is mainly due to poisoning by the "American way of life." American movies and comic books that promote robbery, murder, fighting, and pornography are rampant in Taiwan, causing harm to Taiwanese children. Recently, a seventeen-year-old boy named Xie Asong in Tainan, after watching a vulgar American movie, imitated the plot of such American movies, ran to a brothel to mess around, and after spending all his money, he robbed an old woman of her money with a knife on a remote road. Recently, Taiwan has successively cracked down on juvenile crime gangs called "Iron Fist Gang," "Skull Party," "Five Tiger Generals," and "Cosmic Gang." Many of these gangs imitate black gangs such as the Ku Klux Klan introduced in American movies and comic books, and set up positions such as "Big Boss" and "Little Boss." These juvenile crime gangs often gather crowds to fight, and engage in activities such as robbery, theft, and molesting women.

Taiwan newspapers say that the deteriorating social atmosphere in Taiwan, with brothels and underground dance halls lining the streets, corrupting children, is also an important reason for the increasing number of juvenile criminals.

### 受美国生活方式毒害  台湾少年罪犯大增

　　受美国生活方式毒害
　　台湾少年罪犯大增
    新华社11日讯　据台湾报纸报道，蒋介石集团“中央警官学校”教育长梅可望在4月6日说，台湾的少年刑事犯罪问题非常严重。在1953年，有案可查的台湾少年犯罪人数为一千九百二十二人，到1957年增加为五千八百七十四人，即四年之间增加了两倍。去年显然又比1957年大有增加。梅可望说，许多少年犯罪的案情十分严重，犯罪的范围包括谋杀、抢劫、吸毒、贩毒、盗窃、污辱妇女等等。少年犯中甚至有十二岁以下的小孩子。梅可望承认，目前汹涌的少年儿童犯罪浪潮，正在迅速影响和腐蚀台湾的下一代。
    台湾报纸发表的许多消息表明，台湾少年罪犯问题的日益严重，主要是受了“美国生活方式”的毒害。以宣扬抢劫、凶杀、斗殴和色情为内容的美国电影和小人书在台湾泛滥，使台湾少年儿童受害不浅。最近台南有一个名叫谢阿松的十七岁少年，在观看了美国下流电影后，他模仿这类美国电影的情节，跑到一个娼妓窟中去胡搞，把钱花光后又在偏僻路上持刀抢劫一个老妇人的钱财。最近台湾连续破获名为“铁拳帮”、“骷髅党”、
  “五虎将”，“宇宙帮”等少年犯罪帮会，其中许多帮会都模仿美国电影和小人书介绍的三K党一类黑帮，设置“大龙头”、“小龙头”一类职位。这些少年犯罪帮会常常聚众打架，并且进行抢劫、偷窃、调戏妇女等活动。
    台湾报纸说，台湾社会风气败坏，娼寮、地下舞院等等林立，使少年儿童受到腐蚀，也是少年罪犯日增的重要原因。
