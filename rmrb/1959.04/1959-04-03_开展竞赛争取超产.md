Launch Competitions to Strive for Overproduction

(Reported by our newspaper) The Huyang People's Commune in Dangtu County, Anhui Province, has implemented the principle of "unified leadership, decentralized management," giving full play to the enthusiasm of each production team. Currently, in order to guarantee and exceed the commune's production plans for this year, each production team is launching a vigorous production competition movement.

In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the production teams, after the commune contracted work and output to each production team, members braved the rain to apply 50 dan of human and animal manure per mu to more than 30 mu of third-class seedlings, and further strengthened the management of other fields. The 17th Production Team, which has been doing relatively well in production, has seen even greater production enthusiasm after earnestly implementing the principle of more pay for more work.

Because the responsibilities of each level of the commune are clear and a responsibility system has been established at each level, in order to further mobilize the initiative of the production teams in production, the commune, under unified leadership, clarified the responsibilities of decentralized management, so that the production teams have a certain degree of flexibility in arranging agricultural work according to specific circumstances, while completing the commune's production tasks. This method has promoted the organization of comprehensive production by the production teams. The members' awareness of cherishing public property has also been further enhanced. For example, the commune's more than 1,000 small boats are contracted for management and use by the production teams, and the production teams have taken the initiative to repair and paint them. Because this commune on the one hand implements the principle of more pay for more work and distribution according to labor, and on the other hand vigorously strengthens political work and launches a regular appraisal and competition movement of inserting red flags in each team, each mu, each item, and each person, the method of unified leadership and decentralized management has been fully implemented, and a new upsurge in production has emerged.

    开展竞赛争取超产
    本报讯　安徽省当涂县湖阳人民公社贯彻执行“统一领导、分级管理”的原则，充分发挥了各生产队的积极性。现在，各生产队为了保证和超额完成公社提出的今年各项生产计划，正在开展热火朝天的生产竞赛运动。
    湖阳人民公社为了充分发挥生产队的积极性，在公社向各生产队进行包工包产后，社员们冒雨给三十多亩三类苗每亩追施五十担人畜粪，并进一步加强了其它田的管理。生产搞得比较好的第十七生产队，在切实执行多劳多得的原则后，生产积极性更加高涨。
    由于公社各级职责明确，层层建立了责任制，为了进一步调动生产队在生产上的主动性，这个公社在统一领导下，明确了分级管理的职责，使生产队在完成公社生产任务的要求下，根据具体情况在安排农活上有一定的灵活性。这个办法对生产队组织全面生产起了促进作用。社员爱护公共财物的思想也有了进一步的提高。如公社一千多只小船，由生产队包管包用，生产队就主动地进行了修理和油漆。这个公社因为一方面贯彻多劳多得，按劳分配的原则，一方面又大力加强政治工作，开展队队、亩亩、项项、人人插红旗的定期评比竞赛运动，使统一领导、分级管理的办法得到了全面执行，出现了新的生产高潮。　　　　　　　（李祥仁）
