    Using Advanced Experience to Promote Mine Construction Speed
    Ministry of Coal Requires Shortening Fronts, Concentrating Forces, and Ensuring Key Projects
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union recently held a national on-site construction conference for coal mine capital construction in Hebi City, Henan Province. This conference focused on shortening the front lines, concentrating forces, ensuring key projects, increasing production and practicing economy, and rapid construction. It systematically summarized and exchanged various advanced experiences since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, finding more and better ways to complete this year's coal mine capital construction tasks with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    The conference pointed out that this year's coal mine capital construction tasks have greatly increased compared to last year. In particular, the number of mines and coal washing plants to be transferred to production will increase even more than last year. This is an important component of ensuring the realization of the 380 million tons of coal and 18 million tons of steel plans. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of "the whole country as a single chessboard," shorten the front lines, concentrate forces, and ensure key construction projects, first and foremost ensuring the timely completion and commissioning of mines and coal washing plants to be transferred.
    The conference believes that relying on the broad masses of workers, vigorously engaging in technical revolution, and vigorously launching the movement to increase production and practice economy, and making every effort to break through the difficulties of insufficient materials and equipment, are important keys to ensuring rapid construction and completing coal mine capital construction tasks on schedule and ahead of schedule.
    The conference thoroughly and meticulously summarized and exchanged 22 advanced experiences in accelerating speed and shortening mine construction periods. In terms of shortening the construction period, there is the experience of "five grasps and twelve pushes"; in terms of accelerating tunneling speed, there is the experience of regular multi-cycle operations; in terms of building and installation, there is the experience of three-dimensional cross-operations, layered and segmented operations, and overall installation. The conference also studied the experience of Hebi Coal Mine in accelerating mine construction speed by vigorously engaging in technical revolution. Based on the experiences introduced by various regions, the conference determined to start from the following aspects to overcome the difficulty of insufficient materials: actively seeking sources of supply and strengthening internal adjustment, improving supply management, tapping the potential of enterprises, extensively utilizing substitute materials, and establishing satellite factories to self-produce materials and small equipment.
    The conference pointed out that as long as the relevant units conscientiously promote and implement the above experiences and measures, a greater and better leap forward upsurge will emerge in the national coal mine capital construction.
    More than 500 people, including leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, workers, and trade union cadres from the national coal mine capital construction departments, attended the conference. More than 30 representatives of non-ferrous metal mines under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also participated in the conference.

    用先进经验推动建井速度
    煤炭部要求缩短战线集中力量保证重点
    本报讯　煤炭工业部和中国煤矿工会全国委员会最近在河南省鹤壁市召开了全国煤矿基本建设施工现场会议。这次会议以缩短战线，集中力量，保证重点，增产节约和快速施工为中心，系统地总结交流了1958年大跃进以来的各项先进经验，为多快好省地完成今年煤矿基本建设任务找到了更多更好的途径。
    会议指出，今年煤矿基本建设任务比去年有很大的增长，特别是移交生产的矿井和洗煤厂，将比去年增加得更多，这是保证三亿八千万吨煤和一千八百万吨钢计划实现的重要组成部分。因此，必须坚决地贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的方针，缩短战线，集中力量，保证重点建设，首先是保证移交矿井和洗煤厂的按期建成投入生产。
    会议认为，依靠职工群众，大闹技术革命，大力开展增产节约运动，千方百计地突破材料设备不足的关，是保证快速施工、按期和提前完成煤矿基本建设任务的重要关键。
    会议深入细致地总结和交流了加快速度、缩短建井工期的二十二项先进经验。在缩短工期方面有“五抓十二推”的经验；在加快掘进速度方面，有正规多循环的经验；在建筑安装方面，有立体交叉、分层分段和整体安装的经验。会议还研究了鹤壁煤矿大闹技术革命加速建井速度的经验。根据各地介绍的经验，会议确定从以下几个方面着手克服材料不足的困难；积极寻找货源并且加强内部调剂，改进供应管理，挖掘企业内部潜力，广泛利用代用材料，办卫星厂自产材料及小型设备。
    会议指出，只要各有关单位认真推广贯彻以上的经验和措施，全国煤矿基本建设将出现一个更大更好的跃进高潮。
    参加这次会议的有全国煤矿基本建设部门的领导干部、工程技术人员、工人和工会干部共五百多人。冶金工业部所属有色金属矿的三十多名代表，也参加了这次会议。
