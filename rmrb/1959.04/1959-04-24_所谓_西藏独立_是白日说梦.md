So-called "Tibetan Independence" is a Pipe Dream

Speech by Delegate Xirao Jiacuo

Fellow Delegates, Fellow Committee Members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1959 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the draft 1959 National Budget, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and I express my firm determination to implement them. Now, I will speak on the government's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet and the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials in Tezpur, India, as follows:

The so-called statement of the Dalai Lama is absurd and preposterous, completely different from all the statements made by the Dalai Lama at home and abroad over the past eight years. Since the Dalai Lama has been abducted, how can the so-called statement be spared from coercion?

On April 18, the Dalai Lama, who was abducted to India by the Tibetan reactionary group, was forced to issue a so-called statement of the Dalai Lama, talking at length about Tibetan independence. This statement, full of sophistry, lies, and loopholes, is absurd and preposterous. It is completely different from all the statements made by the Dalai Lama at home and abroad over the past eight years. It is exactly the same as the old tune of Tibetan independence constantly issued by imperialists and foreign reactionaries in recent times. This is entirely a conspiracy. (Applause) The Tibetan reactionary group was able to abduct the Dalai Lama in Lhasa. After arriving in India, under the direct manipulation of imperialists and Indian expansionists, how could the Dalai Lama be spared from being forced to publish fallacies? (Applause) Therefore, we have reason to suspect that this so-called statement is not the words of the real Dalai Lama, but the words of many fake Dalai Lamas. (Laughter, warm applause) Everyone knows that when British imperialism occupied our great neighbor India, it used India as a base to invade our Tibet. After the British Empire was forced to withdraw from India, some Indian expansionists actually forgot the disaster of their dark age of occupation and instead inherited their mantle of aggression, wanting to replace British imperialism's past privileges in Tibet. Truly, they forget the pain once the wound is healed. (Prolonged applause) Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. If it is said that Tibetans are different from Han people, and that this justifies Tibetan independence, wouldn't it also follow that because India has four different castes, that it should be divided into four different independent countries? (Warm applause) Such arrogant actions by expansionists seriously violate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly adhered to by China and India. If they do not change their course, it can be asserted that not only will the expansionists' fantasies never be realized, but they will also invite the misfortune of letting a wolf into the house. (Applause) We cherish Sino-Indian friendship, but we resolutely oppose the foreign expansionists' crude actions of interfering in our internal affairs. (Applause) We believe that this clumsy document, the so-called statement, cannot exonerate the Tibetan reactionary group, nor can it confuse the vision of our country and the people of the world. On the contrary, it exposes the Tibetan rebel group's crimes of betraying the country and the people, and it also reveals to the world the conspiracy of imperialists and Indian expansionists to disintegrate our country's unity and turn Tibet into their colony or protectorate. We express our utmost indignation at this extremely unfriendly attitude. (Warm applause)

The Tibetan reactionary group launched a rebellion, destroying the peaceful and happy life of the Tibetan people and also damaging sacred Buddhism. The people of the whole country are denouncing the rebels and supporting the government's measures to quell the rebellion.

The original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet have consistently adhered to a reactionary stance. Recently, on March 10, they openly tore up the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, abducted the Dalai Lama, gathered rebel bandits, and, under the guise of protecting Buddhism, incited and threatened some of the monks and laypeople who did not know the truth. They clamored wildly for driving out the Han people and for independence, vainly attempting to reverse the wheels of history and enslave the Tibetan people forever. People of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life across the country hate them bitterly and denounce them in unison. After making all possible efforts for a peaceful resolution, the State Council, when peaceful resolution was hopeless, had no choice but to instruct the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the rebellion in order to safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nationalities, and to safeguard the development and prosperity of the Tibetan nationality. It issued an order to abolish the original Tibetan local government that had instigated the rebellion and to have the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercise its functions and powers. The people of the whole country unanimously expressed their support. As a Tibetan Buddhist devout old shramana who loves the motherland, loves Tibet, loves Buddhism, and loves the Dalai Lama, I wholeheartedly express my warm support for and resolute implementation of this wise and correct great measure of the State Council. (Warm applause)

The Tibet region is an inseparable part of China's territory, and the Tibetan nationality is one of the members of the big family of the motherland's nationalities. In the process of the creation and development of the great motherland, it has contributed its hard work like other nationalities, and therefore has a strong and deep love for the great motherland jointly created and developed by all nationalities. This strong and deep sense of patriotism firmly consolidates the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nationalities. (Applause) Due to the imperialist conspiracy to create divisions within our country to facilitate the realization of their aggressive aims, due to the reactionary policies of national oppression and discrimination by the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionary government, and due to the Tibetan reactionary ruling class's reliance on imperialism in order to consolidate its privileges of oppression and exploitation, a reactionary group that relied on imperialism, split the motherland, and enslaved the people has long been formed in Tibet. They disregarded the interests of the country and the nation, violated the will of the people, and consistently advocated secession. Since the Chinese Communist Party led the people of the whole country to overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary regime and establish the People's Republic of China, it has ended the history of national oppression and discrimination in China and begun a new era of national equality and unity, uniting all nationalities more closely. It adopted measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and since then, the central government has always adhered to the agreement, consistently upholding the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nationalities, gradually realizing national regional autonomy, and gradually implementing the policy of democratic reform, doing many unprecedented good things for Tibet, which has won the unanimous support of the broad masses of monks and laypeople in Tibet. In the process of implementing the agreement, in order to take care of the special circumstances of the Tibet region, the government, always prioritizing the country and the nation, adopted extreme patience and waited for the upper-class elements in Tibet who were obstructing progress to wake up, and those who had any sense of the country and the nation should have thoroughly reformed their past mistakes, implemented the agreement, and strived to make due contributions to the great cause of building Tibet. However, the facts were unexpected. The stubborn upper-class elements in Tibet not only did not change their wolfish ambitions because of the central government's patient waiting and lenient policy, but also dreamed different dreams in the same bed. From the day of liberation, they harbored evil intentions and plotted to tear up the agreement. They developed to the point where they openly betrayed the country on March 10, colluding with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and foreign reactionaries, beating to death and wounding patriotic Tibetan cadres. Wherever they went, they robbed monasteries and villages, slaughtered monks and laypeople, destroyed the peaceful and happy life of the Tibetan people, and also destroyed sacred Buddhism. The people of the whole country denounced the rebels in unison and unanimously supported the central leadership's just measures to quell the rebellion, swiftly throwing the reactionary group into the grave they had dug for themselves. (Stormy applause)

Tibet is Chinese territory, which the whole world recognizes. The so-called "Tibetan independence" is an unfounded pipe dream, which is neither in line with historical facts and the current situation, nor is it in line with the interests of the Tibetan people and the common interests of all ethnic groups in the country.

China is a multi-ethnic country. National regional autonomy embodies both our country's unified leadership and the rights of all ethnic groups to be masters of their own affairs. It is the best form of government that suits the characteristics of minority nationalities. The agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet clearly stipulates the gradual realization of national regional autonomy. In 1956, after full consultation between the central government and the original Tibetan local government, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established. Over the past few years, under the leadership of the central government, the Preparatory Committee has made unprecedented achievements in Tibet's agricultural and animal husbandry production, transportation, culture and health, and industry, and has begun to change the poor and backward face of Tibet. If it were not for the repeated obstruction of the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, undoubtedly greater achievements would have been made. The broad masses of monks and laypeople deeply realize that implementing national regional autonomy in the big family of the unified motherland and the solidarity of the nationalities means the prosperity and happiness of the Tibetan nationality, and therefore firmly follow the road of national regional autonomy. However, the Tibetan reactionary group is unwilling for the Tibetan people to realize national regional autonomy and live a happy and prosperous life. They are single-mindedly dreaming of realizing the Tibetan independence that imperialists have long planned in an attempt to disintegrate China's unity, in order to achieve their ugly ambition of eternally enslaving the Tibetan people. Recently, in the so-called statement of the Dalai Lama, they talked at length about their independence, which is extremely absurd. The so-called argument of Tibetan independence is an unfounded pipe dream. Let us recall history. In the territory of today's Tibet, the Songtsen Gampo Dynasty of the Tang Dynasty once appeared in history. It only lasted for ten generations. In the time equivalent to Emperor Wuzong of the Tang Dynasty, the dynasty ended with the death of the Tibetan King Langdarma. Thereafter, during the late Tang Dynasty and the entire Song Dynasty, the Tibetan region was in a state of disunity. It was not until Kublai Khan unified China during the Yuan Dynasty that Tibet was transformed from disunity to unity, becoming a complete administrative region within the Yuan Dynasty, and Phagpa was appointed to administer Tibet under the unified leadership of the Yuan Dynasty. After seventy-five years, it was usurped by its subordinate Pamo Zhuba. After another seventy-five years, it was usurped by its subordinate Renben. After three more generations, it was usurped by its subordinate Tsangpa Gyaeho. After three more generations, it entered the early Qing Dynasty. The Qing court's Gushri Khan (i.e., the present-day Prince of Henan Mongol Banner in Qinghai) destroyed Tsangpa Gyaeho, and then the Kangxi Emperor appointed the Fifth Dalai Lama to administer Tibet, and separately appointed the Dalai Lama's Xiangzo (Chief Administrator) as the executive. From then on, the Dalai Lama gradually formed a leadership position in Tibet. By the time of the Seventh Dalai Lama in the sixteenth year of Qianlong, the Qing court approved the establishment of the Kashag, this Tibetan local government, which directly obeyed the leadership of the Manchu Qing resident minister in Tibet. When there were imperial edicts from the Qing court, the Dalai Lama had to perform the ceremony of three kneelings and nine prostrations to receive the edict. The thirteen ranks of officials in the original Kashag government, such as Kalon, Zhasa, and Taiji, all had to be approved and appointed by the Qing court. From this, it can be seen that the Dalai Lama's leadership position in Tibet was obtained through the appointment by the unified government of China at that time, and the Kashag local government was even a level of administrative agency under the unified government at that time. These historical facts show that the Tibet region has been an administrative region of China since ancient times. From the current situation, Tibet is a local region of China, and the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region has been established. The Dalai Lama is not only appointed by the state to serve as the chairman of the Preparatory Committee, but he was also elected as one of the leaders of the state's highest organ of power by the First Session of the First National People's Congress. At the same time, because the central government has correctly implemented the policy of national equality and unity, bringing and gradually bringing greater happiness and prosperity to the Tibetan people, they support the policy of national unity and ethnic solidarity that is in line with their own interests. Therefore, we can draw such a conclusion that the fallacies of the Tibetan reactionary group and the so-called Dalai Lama's statement about Tibetan independence are neither in line with historical facts and the current situation, nor are they in line with the interests of the Tibetan people and the common interests of all ethnic groups in the country. Their purpose is to make the Tibetan people lose the leadership of the motherland, so that they can wantonly slaughter and enslave them. Our answer to this fallacy is very simple: we firmly oppose independence that splits the motherland, and we firmly support the implementation of national regional autonomy within the big family of the unified motherland. (Warm applause) The fact that Tibet is Chinese territory is recognized by the whole world, and even the imperialists who are trying to invade China cannot deny this. As for their shameless efforts to make a big fuss about the Tibet issue, falsely accusing our government's just measures to quell the rebellion as barbaric aggression, it is actually to cover up their barbaric crimes of attempting to disintegrate our country's unity in order to achieve their aggressive aims. At the same time, behind this conspiracy lies the even more vicious conspiracy of using our country's suppression of the rebellion to create tension in Asia, undermine our country's friendly relations with Asian countries, in order to force Asian countries to abandon their neutral policies and once again submit to their enslavement. We urgently demand that Asian countries see through their deceit, tear off the painted skin of imperialist incitement and aggression, so as to ensure the friendly cooperation of Asian countries. (Warm applause)

The 1.1 million-plus working people of Tibet will build a paradise on earth on the Tibetan plateau. This is a democratic reform worthy of sympathy from all kind-hearted people in the world. It is an issue that must be resolved in the process of the Tibetan nationality moving towards happiness and prosperity. The Tibetan traitorous group that enslaves the Tibetan people is a big mountain pressing down on the heads of the Tibetan people. The enslavement of layers of feudal privileges hinders the road to happiness and prosperity for the Tibetan people. If democratic reform is not implemented, it will not be possible to get rid of the poor and backward state. Therefore, the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet stipulates that the Tibetan local government should automatically carry out reforms. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the central government, in view of the low level of awareness of the upper-class people in Tibet, has always adopted patient and lenient measures, persuaded the masses, and retained their various privileges. In 1956, the central government announced that it would not carry out reforms in Tibet for six years. In the future, when and how to carry out reforms will still be decided by the Tibetan national leaders, upper-class people, and the people after joint consultation, giving them full consideration time. It can be said that everything has been done with the utmost benevolence and righteousness. However, the Tibetan reactionary group completely disregarded the Tibetan people's just demands for reform and was always unwilling to give up their privileges. At the same time, they were afraid that the people's awareness was increasing day by day and felt that their reactionary rule of enslaving the people was in imminent danger. Therefore, they consistently carried out counter-revolutionary activities, once instructing the reactionary elements in Xikang to carry out armed rebellion and destroy the reform work in the Xikang area, as the front line for their resistance to the motherland and to cover up Tibet's own independence. After the rebellion in the above-mentioned areas was quelled, they sheltered the escaped rebels who had slipped through the net, robbed the people, disrupted transportation, and attacked cadres and troops stationed there by the central government. The central government still repeatedly showed leniency and tolerance, hoping that they would wake up, but the reactionary group instead thought that they were weak and could be bullied, and openly betrayed the country with armed forces, vainly attempting to drive away the Communist Party in one fell swoop, fundamentally burying the people's desire for reform and consolidating their rule of enslavement. The Tibetan people urgently demanded reform and deeply knew that the Communist Party supported the people's desire for reform. Therefore, they unanimously supported the People's Liberation Army to quickly put down the rebellion, in order to gradually carry out reform. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "In any case, reform will be gradually carried out under full consideration of the characteristics of Tibet. In the process of reform, the Tibetan people's religious beliefs and customs will be fully respected, and the Tibetan people's excellent culture will be respected and developed." This is extremely in line with the situation in Tibet, and we fully support it. (Applause) Now there are some people in the world who deliberately do not understand the Tibetan people's desire for reform and pretend to sympathize with the Tibetan people. However, what they sympathize with is only a small number of reactionary elements, nearly 20,000 out of the 1.2 million people in Tibet, which is either ulterior motives or naivety. We do not welcome this. We welcome them to sympathize with the majority of the 1.1 million-plus Tibetan working people, the majority who will build a paradise on earth on the Tibetan plateau, which is worthy of sympathy from all kind-hearted people in the world. (Prolonged applause)

The policy of freedom of religious belief is the Communist Party's firm and long-term policy towards religion. The Tibetan traitorous group's attempt to use the Communist Party's old tune of destroying Buddhism to shake the Buddhists' trust and loyalty to the Party is a waste of time.

The policy of freedom of religious belief is the Communist Party's firm and long-term policy towards religion. The domestic and foreign reactionaries' usual trick of slandering the Communist Party for destroying religion, and the slander against the Party on the religious issue in the recent so-called statement of the Dalai Lama, cannot shake our trust in the Party in the slightest. Since liberation, the Party and the People's Government have treated all religions in the country equally and have taken protective measures. Politically, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama have participated in the ranks of leaders of the state's highest organs of power. I and many Buddhist figures have also participated in the leadership work of state power at all levels, without discriminating against the political rights of all religious people. The Chinese Buddhist Association, the national Buddhist organization, and the branches of Buddhist associations in Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and other places have all been established. Legitimate Buddhist activities not only have freedom in the country, but also have freedom abroad. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, and I and many Buddhist figures of various ethnic groups, have all participated in many international Buddhist activities. The religious life of believers is respected by the people. The material life of believers is taken care of by the government. Famous Buddhist mountains and ancient temples, such as Mount Wutai, which was destroyed by the enemy and puppets during the War of Resistance Against Japan, Ta'er Monastery, the birthplace of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Yellow Sect, Xiajiong Temple in Huangzhong County, Qinghai, the hometown of the Dalai Lama, Yonghe Temple in Beijing, Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou, and many other monasteries and daochang, have been renovated with the assistance of the government. The government has also allocated huge sums of money to build the Buddha Tooth Relic Pagoda in the scenic area of Xishan in Beijing. Many Buddhist cultural relics and historical sites, such as the murals of Dunhuang and Bingling, the stone carvings of Yungang and Longmen, the Fangshan Stone Sutras, and the Jinling Sutra Plates, have also been preserved and sorted out with the help of the government. Taking the Tibet region, which the rebels are familiar with, as an example, the central government has not changed the Dalai Lama's inherent status and powers and the income of the monasteries, and monks at all levels continue to serve. The People's Liberation Army troops and working cadres stationed in Tibet have always respected the beliefs of believers. When Vice Premier Chen Yi went to Lhasa to congratulate the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, he held a vegetarian feast for more than 200,000 monks in the entire Tibet and presented gifts to various monasteries and donated to the monasteries' permanent residents. All of this is a manifestation of the great ethnic policy of the Party and Chairman Mao, who are revered by Buddhists, and it is truly immeasurable merit. (Warm applause) This is incomparable to Emperor Wu of Liang in China and Emperor Ashoka in India, who were known for protecting the Dharma in the history of Chinese and foreign Buddhism. (Applause) The heinous Tibetan traitorous group vainly attempts to use the Communist Party's old tune of destroying Buddhism to shake the Buddhists' trust and loyalty to the Party, which is a waste of time. Let's take a look at the traitorous group that flaunts the protection of Buddhism. They abduct the Dalai Lama, tarnish the reputation of the Buddhist leader, threaten and deceive believing masses to open fire on a large scale in order to protect their privileges, burn scriptures and images, pagodas and temples, rob Buddhist cultural relics and treasures, and slaughter lamas, committing heinous crimes that are not only intolerable by the laws of the country, but also not allowed by the teachings of Buddhism. They are truly jackals in Buddhist robes. Our People's Liberation Army, even in the battle to quell the rebellion, still adheres to respecting religious beliefs and protecting temples and cultural relics and historical sites. For example, in order to cherish the residence of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan architectural art, it also paid attention to protecting the integrity of the architecture of the Potala Palace, which was occupied by the headquarters of the rebellion. From these sharp contrasts, it is not difficult to recognize that it is not the Party and the government, as accused by the traitorous group, but the traitorous group itself that is destroying Buddhism. (Warm applause) The so-called statement of the Dalai Lama that many lamas were killed is not in line with the facts. Except that in the battle to quell the rebellion, the bullets and shells were merciless, and it is inevitable that some armed rebels who were killed had individual Buddhist dregs wearing cassocks, there is simply no such thing as many lamas being killed. Moreover, this must be the responsibility of the rebels, first of all, the instigators of the rebellion. Our Tibetan people have strong Buddhist beliefs and even sharper insight. Those who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, kill and set fires, and tarnish the sanctity of Buddhism are considered to have more than deserved death and will never be tolerated. (Applause) When a mad dog bites someone, it is right to kill it. It would be too naive to expect us not to fight back when we are bitten by a mad dog. (The audience is active and applauds) We believe that killing a few fake lamas who betrayed the country, the people, and Buddhism is completely just, because it is not only killing rebels and traitors for the country and the people, but also protecting the Dharma by eliminating dregs and rectifying rules for the Buddhist community. (Laughter, warm applause) The imperialists and their spokesmen are taking this opportunity to stir up trouble, putting on a show of crying and weeping for the destruction of Tibetan Buddhism, as if they had lost their parents. (Laughter) We are well aware that imperialists are accustomed to using the destruction of Buddhism to create a tense psychology among Buddhists towards the Communist Party. In order to deceive the religious community into trusting them, they sometimes pretend to shed tears, but fake tears can never deceive Chinese Buddhists into doubting the Chinese Communist Party, which correctly implements the policy of freedom of religious belief and takes protective measures for religion. (Warm applause) However, among foreign Buddhist figures, there may be people who do not understand the truth and have speculations. This is completely unnecessary. We believe that many wise friends in the international Buddhist community have spoken very well. They believe that this Tibetan rebellion has nothing to do with Buddhism, such as saying: "No true Buddhist disciple would pick up the machine guns supplied by imperialists to fire at personnel who have already proven by their actions that they respect religious freedom." This is a powerful condemnation of the shameless slander of imperialism. (Warm applause)

Hope that the Dalai Lama will adhere to his patriotic stance, not be shaken by the reactionary group, strive to get rid of the abduction, and return to the motherland.

In the past, the two Buddhist leaders, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, were estranged for a long time due to the incitement of domestic and foreign reactionaries. After liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, they reunited and cooperated hand in hand, for which all Buddhists are grateful. After the Dalai Lama was abducted abroad by the reactionary group this time, the country and the people were considerate of his situation and retained his position. Premier Zhou clearly expressed in his report to the National People's Congress that he hoped that he could get rid of the abduction and return to the motherland, fully demonstrating the country's concern for the Dalai Lama. Even after the publication of the absurd so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama," the Party, the government, and the people of the whole country still clearly discerned and suspected that "this statement is not the Dalai Lama's own statement, but was imposed on the Dalai Lama by others." I wholeheartedly express my gratitude for this understanding and love for the Dalai Lama. (Applause) I love the Dalai Lama. I would like to say a word to the Dalai Lama. As mentioned earlier, the Dalai Lama's leadership position in Tibet began with the appointment of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. In New China, because the Dalai Lama supported the unity of the motherland, he gained even greater trust from the people and was given the lofty honor of being one of the leaders of the state's highest organ of power. This shows that the Dalai Lama can only gain the trust and honor of the people by accepting the leadership of the motherland and adhering to the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nationalities. He must not leave the motherland and lose the trust of the people. I would like to remotely send a Hada, hoping that he will adhere to the patriotic stance of unifying the motherland and unifying the nationalities, not be shaken by the reactionary group, strive to get rid of the abduction, and return to the motherland to build a paradise on earth on the Tibetan plateau together with the people of the whole country. (Long and stormy applause)

Some of the Tibetan reactionary group were my students in the past, and some were friends in the past. Now you have betrayed the motherland and are all my enemies. (Applause) I want to tell you frankly that continuing to be reactionary is definitely not the way out. A life of exile abroad is also extremely sad, and in the future, you will ultimately not escape the judgment of the people. The only way out is to break with the imperialists and Indian expansionists and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group and bow your heads and confess your sins to the people. (Warm applause) The people are compassionate, and the door of leniency is open to those who sincerely repent and return. Quickly perform meritorious deeds to atone for your crimes and strive for the leniency of the people. Be careful not to mislead yourselves in choosing what to go to and what to follow. (Applause)

Now that the Tibetan rebellion has been quelled, the big mountain pressing down on the heads of the people has been removed, the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nationalities has been further consolidated, and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has exercised the functions and powers of the original Tibetan local government under the leadership of the Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni. The national regional autonomy and democratic reforms that the Tibetan people have dreamed of will be gradually and thoroughly realized. In the future, the diligent and brave Tibetan nationality will, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the support of the people of the whole country, especially the Han people, give full play to their vigorous revolutionary vitality, muster their energy, and build the Tibetan plateau into a paradise on earth. (Prolonged applause)

Finally, I wish for a swift and complete victory in the battle to sweep away the rebels in the remote areas of Tibet, and for the vigorous development of all construction and reform undertakings and Buddhism in the newly born Tibet. (Long and warm applause)

专栏：

    所谓“西藏独立”是白日说梦
    喜饶嘉错代表的发言各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告、李维汉副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，并表示坚决贯彻执行。现在我就政府平定西藏的叛乱问题，暨在印度提斯浦尔经由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”发言如下：
    所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，内容荒谬绝伦，它同达赖喇嘛八年以来在国内外所发表的一切言论完全不同。达赖喇嘛既被劫持，所谓声明，岂能幸免不受强迫
    四月十八日，被西藏反动集团挟持前往印度的达赖喇嘛，被迫发表了一个所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，大谈其西藏独立。这个词屈理屈谎话连篇，漏洞百出的声明，内容荒谬绝伦，它同达赖喇嘛八年以来在国内外所发表的一切言论完全不同，它同最近以来，帝国主义者及外国反动派曾不断发出过的西藏独立的陈腔谰调，如出一辙，这完全是一种阴谋。（鼓掌）西藏反动集团在拉萨能够劫持达赖喇嘛，到了印度后，在帝国主义者及印度扩张主义者的直接摆布下，达赖喇嘛岂能幸免不被强迫发表谬论，（鼓掌）因此我们有理由怀疑这个所谓声明，不是真达赖的话，而是许许多多假达赖的话。（笑声，热烈鼓掌）人们都知道，当英帝国主义霸占我们伟大的邻邦印度时，曾利用印度为基地侵略我国西藏，在英帝国被迫退出印度后，而印度的一些扩张主义者，居然忘怀其被霸占的黑暗时代的灾难，反而继承其侵略衣钵，欲取英帝国主义过去在西藏的特权而代之，真是好了疮疤忘了痛。（经久不息的掌声）西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，如果说西藏人不同于汉人，可以成立西藏独立，岂不因印度四种种姓，各不相同，可以成立四个不同的独立国家吗？（热烈鼓掌）扩张主义者这种狂妄的举动，严重地违背了中印共同遵守的和平共处五项原则，如不改弦更张，可以断言，不仅扩张主义者的空想永远无法达到，反而将招致引狼入室的后患。（鼓掌）我们珍视中印友谊，但我们坚决反对外国扩张者干涉我国内政的粗暴行动。（鼓掌）我们认为所谓声明这一拙劣文件，不但不能为西藏反动集团开脱罪责、混淆我国和全世界人民的视听，反而把西藏叛乱集团叛国叛人民的罪行暴露无遗，也把帝国主义者和印度扩张主义者妄图瓦解我国统一，置西藏为他们的殖民地或保护国的阴谋大白于天下，我们对这种极不友好的态度，表示无比的愤慨。（热烈鼓掌）
    西藏反动集团发动叛乱，破坏了西藏人民的和平幸福生活，也破坏了神圣的佛教。全国人民同声声讨叛逆，支持政府平乱措施
    原西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团，一贯坚持反动立场，最近竟于三月十日，公开撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，劫持达赖喇嘛，纠集叛匪，假借保护佛教的旗号，煽惑和威胁部分不明真象的僧俗群众，狂妄地叫嚣驱汉独立，妄图扭转历史车轮，永远奴役西藏人民，全国各族各界人民，莫不切齿痛恨，同声声讨。国务院在作了种种和平解决的仁至义尽的努力之后，处于和平解决已属无望之际，为了维护祖国统一民族团结，为了维护西藏民族的发展繁荣，不得已而责成人民解放军西藏军区彻底讨平叛乱，明令撤销策动叛乱的原西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使其职权，全国人民一致表示拥护。作为一个爱祖国、爱西藏、爱佛教、爱达赖的藏族佛教的虔诚老沙门的我，对国务院此一英明贤能的伟大正确措施，衷心表示热诚的拥护和坚决贯彻执行。（热烈鼓掌）
    西藏地区是中国领土不可分割的一部分，西藏民族是组成祖国大家庭民族成员之一，在伟大祖国的缔造和发展过程中，同其他民族一样，曾经贡献了自己的辛勤劳动，因而对各民族共同缔造和发展起来的伟大祖国，天赋了强烈深厚的热爱，这种强烈深厚的爱国感，牢不可破地巩固着祖国统一和民族团结。（鼓掌）由于帝国主义阴谋在我国内部制造分裂以利其实现侵略目的，由于清朝及国民党反动政府民族压迫歧视政策的倒行逆施，由于西藏反动统治阶级投靠帝国主义以便巩固其压迫剥削的特权，从而长久以来在西藏形成了一个投靠帝国主义、分裂祖国、奴役人民的反动集团。它们不顾国家民族利益，违背人民意志，一贯主张分裂。自从中国共产党领导全国人民推翻了国民党反动政权建立了中华人民共和国后，结束了中国民族压迫歧视的历史，开始了民族平等团结的新纪元，把各民族更加紧密地团结在一起，对西藏采取了和平解放的措施，之后，中央始终坚持照协议办事，一贯坚持祖国统一民族团结，逐步实现民族区域自治，逐步实现民主改革的政策，给西藏做了许多史无前例的好事，获得了西藏广大僧俗人民的一致拥护。政府在执行协议中，为了照顾西藏地方的特殊情况，对西藏上层分子的因循阻碍，始终以国家民族为重，采取了极大的耐心等待，冀其幡然觉悟，凡稍有国家民族观念的人，应当如何痛改前非，贯彻协议，争取在建设西藏的伟大事业中作出应有的贡献。然而事实出乎意料，顽固不化的西藏上层分子，不但未因中央的耐心等待的宽大政策改变其狼子野心，反而同床各梦，从解放之日起即包藏祸心，蓄谋撕毁协议，发展至最近竟于3月10日，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石集团和外国反动派公开叛国，打死打伤爱国的藏族干部，所到之处，抢劫寺院村落，残杀僧俗群众，破坏了西藏人民和平幸福的生活，也破坏了神圣的佛教，全国人民同声声讨叛逆，一致支持中央领导西藏人民平乱的正义措施，迅速地把反动集团投进它们自己所卜葬的墓穴。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    西藏是中国的领土，全世界都承认。所谓“西藏独立”是毫无理由的白日说梦，既不符合历史事实和现实情况，也是违背西藏人民利益和全国各族人民共同利益的
    中国是个多民族的国家，民族区域自治，既体现了我国的统一领导，又体现了各民族的当家作主的权利，是切合少数民族特点的最好政权形式，在和平解放西藏办法的协议中，明白规定了逐步实现民族区域自治。一九五六年，中央与原西藏地方政府经过充分协商，成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，几年以来，筹委会在中央的领导下，对西藏的农牧业生产，交通运输，文化卫生以及工业，做出了前所未有的成绩，开始改变着西藏贫穷落后的面貌，如果不是原西藏地方政府及上层反动集团的百般阻扰，无疑的将取得更大的成就，广大僧俗人民，深深体会到在祖国统一民族团结的大家庭中实行民族区域自治，即是意味着西藏民族的繁荣幸福，因而坚决走民族区域自治的道路，无如西藏反动集团，不愿西藏人民实现民族区域自治过幸福繁荣的生活，一心梦想实现帝国主义企图瓦解中国统一而长期策划的西藏独立，以达到他永远奴役西藏人民的丑恶野心，最近在所谓达赖喇嘛的声明中，大谈其独立，荒谬达于极点。所谓西藏独立之说，是毫无理由的白日说梦，让我们来回忆一下历史吧，在今天西藏的辖区中，历史上曾出现过唐代的松占冈布王朝，仅仅传了十代，在相当于唐武宗时，王朝即随藏王朗达马之死而告终。其后，历唐末及整个宋代，西藏地区处于四分五裂的状态。到了元世祖统一中国后，才使西藏由分而合成为元代辖区中的一个完整行政区域，并册封帕思巴在元朝的统一领导下主管西藏。经过了七十五年，为其属下帕么朱瓦所篡夺。又经过了七十五年，为其属下仁本所篡夺。又经过三传，为其属下藏巴见呵所篡夺。又经过三传，进入清朝初年，清廷古什汗（即今青海河南蒙旗亲王）灭掉了藏巴见呵，才由康熙册封第五世达赖喇嘛主管西藏，并另封达赖襄佐（总管）为执政，从此，达赖喇嘛才在西藏逐渐形成领导地位。到了乾隆十六年第七代达赖喇嘛时，才由清廷批准成立噶厦此一西藏地方政府，直接服从满清驻藏办事大臣的领导，遇有清廷谕旨，达赖喇嘛应行三跪九叩之礼接旨，原噶厦政府中的噶伦、扎萨、台吉等十三级官职，均必须经清廷批准任命。由此可见，达赖喇嘛在西藏的领导地位，是由当时中国的统一政府册封而获得，而噶厦地方政权，更是当时统一政府所属的一级行政机构。这些历史说明了西藏地方自古即为中国的行政区域之一，从今天的现状讲，西藏是中国的一个地方区域，并成立了自治区筹备委员会，达赖喇嘛不仅受国家的任命，担任筹委会主任委员，并经第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议选举为国家最高权力机关的领导人之一。同时，由于中央正确执行了民族平等团结政策，给西藏人民带来了并将逐渐带来更大的幸福繁荣，因而拥护符合自己利益的祖国统一民族团结的政策，由此，我们可以做这样一个结论，西藏反动集团和所谓达赖喇嘛声明中所谓西藏独立的谬论，是既不符合历史事实和现实情况，也是违背西藏人民利益和全国各族人民共同利益的，其目的在使西藏人民失去祖国的领导，以便其为所欲为的宰割奴役。我们对这个谬论的回答很简单，我们坚决反对分裂祖国的独立，我们坚决拥护在祖国统一的大家庭内实行民族区域自治。（热烈鼓掌）西藏是中国领土的事实，全世界都承认，甚至力图侵略中国的帝国主义也无法否认这一点，至于它们还厚颜无耻地在西藏问题上大做文章，诬蔑我政府平乱的正义措施为野蛮侵略，实际上是为掩盖其妄图瓦解我国统一，以达其侵略目的的野蛮罪行。同时，在这个阴谋的背后，还隐藏着利用我国平乱，制造亚洲紧张局势，破坏我国与亚洲国家的友好关系，以遂其迫使亚洲国家放弃中立政策，重新供其奴役的更恶毒的大阴谋，我们迫切要求亚洲国家洞烛其奸，揭下帝国主义挑拨侵略的画皮，以确保亚洲国家的友好合作。（热烈鼓掌）西藏一百一十几万劳动人民将在西藏高原建设人间乐园，这是值得世界上一切好心人同情的民主改革是西藏民族走向幸福繁荣的过程中必须解决的问题，奴役西藏人民的西藏叛国集团，是压在西藏人民头上的大山，层层的封建特权的奴役，阻碍了西藏人民幸福繁荣的道路，如果不实行民主改革，就不可能摆脱贫穷落后的面貌，所以在和平解放西藏办法的协议中，规定西藏地方政府应自动进行改革。中央在西藏和平解放以后，鉴于西藏上层人士的觉悟不高，始终采取耐心等待的宽大措施，说服群众，保留其种种特权，1956年，中央并宣布在六年内在西藏不进行改革，以后在什么时候如何进行改革，仍然要根据客观情况，由西藏民族领袖，上层人士和人民群众共同协商解决，给予充分考虑时间，可谓仁至义尽。但是西藏反动集团，根本无视西藏人民希望改革的正义要求，始终不愿放弃其特权。同时又慑于人民群众的觉悟日益提高，感到其奴役人民的反动统治的岌岌可危，因而一贯进行反革命活动，曾指使西康反动分子，武装叛乱，破坏西康地区的改革工作，作为其反抗祖国的前线，掩护西藏本区驱汉独立。在上述地区叛乱平息后，又庇护逃往西藏地区漏网叛匪、抢劫人民、破坏交通和袭击中央派驻当地干部和部队，中央仍然一再宽大容忍，冀其觉悟，而反动集团反而认为软弱可欺，公然武装叛国，妄图一举赶走共产党，根本葬送人民改革愿望，巩固其奴役统治。西藏人民迫切要求改革，深深知道共产党是支持人民改革愿望的，因而一致支援人民解放军迅速扑灭了叛乱，以达逐步进行改革，周总理在报告中指出，“无论如何，改革将在充分照顾西藏特点的条件下逐步进行，在改革过程中将充分尊重藏族人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，尊重和发扬藏族的优秀文化。”极端符合西藏情况，我们完全拥护。（鼓掌）现在世界上有一些人，故意不了解西藏广大人民的改革愿望，假惺惺地装出同情西藏人的面孔，然而他们同情的不过是西藏一百二十万人口中近二万人的少数反动分子，即不是别有用心，也是一种幼稚，我们不欢迎，我们欢迎他们同情西藏劳动人民一百一十几万的多数，这个将在西藏高原建设人间乐园的多数，是值得世界上一切好心人同情的。（经久不息的掌声）
    宗教信仰自由政策是共产党对待宗教坚定不移的长期政策。西藏叛国集团妄图用共产党破坏佛教的陈腔谰调动摇佛教徒对党的信赖和忠诚，是白费心机的
    宗教信仰自由政策，是共产党对待宗教坚定不移的长期政策，国内外反动派诬蔑共产党破坏宗教的惯技，以及最近所谓达赖喇嘛的声明中在宗教问题对党所进行的诽谤，丝毫不能动摇我们对党的信赖。解放以来，党和人民政府，对国内各宗教一视同仁的采取保护措施，从政治上讲，达赖和班禅，参加了国家最高权力机关领导人的行列，我和许多佛教界人士也参加了国家各级政权的领导工作，对所有一切宗教者的政治权利毫不歧视。全国佛教组织的中国佛教协会及西藏、内蒙等其他各地的佛协分支机构，均已成立。正当的佛教活动，不仅在国内有自由，在国外同样有自由，达赖和班禅，我和许多各族佛教人士，均曾参加过不少国际佛教活动。教徒的宗教生活受到人民的尊重。教徒的物质生活，得到政府照顾。佛教的名山古刹，如在抗战时期被敌伪所毁坏的五台山，黄教祖师宗喀巴的诞生地的塔尔寺，达赖喇嘛家乡的青海湟中县的峡竣寺，北京雍和宫，杭州灵隐寺等许多丛林道场，均在政府的资助下修复一新，政府并指拨巨款，在北京西山名胜区修建佛牙舍利宝塔，敦煌和炳灵等地的壁画，云岗和龙门等地的石刻，房山石经，金陵经版等许多佛教文物古迹，也在政府的帮助下，得到保存和整理。拿叛乱分子所熟知的西藏地区来说，达赖固有地位和职权及寺院收入，中央均未予变更，各级僧官照常供职，驻藏人民解放军部队和工作干部，一贯尊重教徒信仰，陈毅副总理赴拉萨祝贺西藏自治区筹委会成立时，在全藏斋僧二十余万，并赠送各寺礼品，捐助各寺常住，这一切都是佛教徒敬爱的党和毛主席伟大的民族政策的体现，真是功德无量。（热烈鼓掌）这是中外佛教史上以护法闻名的中国梁武帝和印度无忧王所无法比拟的。（鼓掌）丧尽天良的西藏叛国集团，妄图用共产党破坏佛教的陈腔谰调来动摇佛教徒对党的信赖和忠诚，是白费心机的。我们再看看标榜保护佛教的叛国集团，他们挟持达赖，沾污佛教领袖的声誉，威胁和欺骗信佛群众为保护其特权而广开杀戒，烧毁经像塔寺，劫走佛教文物珍藏，残杀喇嘛，造下了五逆十恶大罪，不仅为国法所不容，也为教规所不许，真是披上佛教外衣的豺狼，而我们的人民解放军，即使在平乱的战斗中，仍然坚持尊重宗教信仰，保护寺庙和文物古迹，例如为了珍惜达赖喇嘛驻锡之地和西藏建筑艺术，对策划叛乱的司令部所盘踞的布达拉宫也注意保护了建筑的完整。从这些鲜明的对比中，不难认识，破坏佛教的不是叛国集团所指责的党和政府而是叛国集团本身。（热烈鼓掌）所谓达赖喇嘛声明中说许多喇嘛被杀，是不符事实的，除在平乱战斗中，枪弹无情，难免在打死的一些武装叛匪中有个别披上袈裟的佛门败类外，根本无所谓许多喇嘛被杀之事，而且这必须由叛乱者首先是叛乱的指使者负责。我们藏族人民有强烈的佛教信仰，更有锋利的慧眼，对那些勾结帝国主义，背叛祖国，杀人放火，沾污佛教圣洁的假佛教徒，认为死有余罪，决不姑息。（鼓掌）当疯狗咬人时，打死它是应该的，妄想我们在受到疯狗狂咬的时候，不还手招架，未免也太天真。（全场活跃、鼓掌）我们认为打死了几个叛国叛人民叛佛教的假喇嘛，是完全正义的，因为这不仅是为国家人民诛了乱臣贼子，也是为佛门除败类正清规的护法功德。（笑声、热烈鼓掌）帝国主义者及其代言人，借此兴风作浪，装腔作势的表演一出为西藏佛教遭破坏而痛哭流涕，如丧考妣的丑戏，（笑声）我们熟知帝国主义者惯用破坏佛教来制造佛教徒对共产党的紧张心理，为了骗取宗教界的轻信，有时装得声泪俱下，但是，假眼泪无论如何也骗取不了中国佛教徒会怀疑正确执行信仰自由政策而对宗教采取保护措施的中国共产党，（热烈鼓掌）可是国外佛教人士中，可能有不明真象、发生揣测的人，这是毫不必要的，我们认为国际佛教界有许多贤达的朋友讲得很好，他们认为这次西藏叛乱和佛教没有任何关系，如说：“没有真正的佛门弟子，会拿起帝国主义供给的机关枪来向已经用行动证明尊重宗教自由的人员开火”。这是对帝国主义无耻谰言的有力谴责。（热烈鼓掌）
    希望达赖喇嘛坚持爱国立场，不为反动集团所动摇，努力摆脱挟持，回到祖国
    过去达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼两位佛教领袖，由于国内外反动派的挑拨离间而长期不睦，解放后，由于党和毛主席的正确领导而重归于好携手合作，佛教徒莫不感激。在这次达赖被反动集团挟持出国后，国家和人民都体谅他的处境，保留他的地位，周总理在人大报告中，明白表示希望他能摆脱挟持，回到祖国。充分表现了国家对达赖的关怀。甚至在荒谬的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”发表后，党和政府及全国人民仍明察秋毫，怀疑“这个声明不是达赖喇嘛本人的声明，而是别人强加于达赖喇嘛的”。这种对达赖的体谅爱护，我衷心表示感谢。（鼓掌）我敬爱达赖喇嘛，我愿向达赖喇嘛进一言，如前所述，达赖喇嘛在西藏领导地位的取得，始自满清的册封，到了新中国，由于达赖喇嘛拥护祖国统一，更加得到人民信任，给予国家最高权力机关领导人之一的崇高荣誉。足见达赖喇嘛只有接受祖国的领导，坚持祖国统一民族团结，才能得到人民的信任和荣誉，切不可脱离祖国，丧失人民的信任，我谨遥寄哈达一张，切望坚持祖国统一民族团结的爱国立场，不为反动集团所动摇，努力摆脱挟持，回到祖国，同全国人民一起建设西藏高原的人间乐园。（长时间暴风雨般的掌声）
    西藏反动集团中，有的过去是我的学生，有的过去是朋友，现在你们背叛祖国，都是我的敌人，（鼓掌）我要正告你们，继续反动，是肯定没有出路的，国外流亡生涯，又是至可悲的，而且将来终究逃不过人民的审判，唯一的出路是与帝国主义者和印度扩张主义者、蒋介石反动集团一刀两断，向人民低头认罪。（热烈鼓掌）人民是慈悲的，宽大之门对真诚悔罪来归的人是开着的，其速立功赎罪，争取人民的宽大，孰去孰从，幸勿自误。（鼓掌）
    现在西藏叛乱已经平息，压在人民头上的大山已经搬掉了，祖国统一民族团结更加巩固了，西藏自治区筹备委员会已在班禅额尔德尼代理主任委员的领导下，行使原西藏地方政府职权，西藏人民梦寐以求的民族区域自治和民主改革将逐步彻底实现，今后勤劳勇敢的西藏民族，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在全国人民特别是汉族人民的支援下，将发挥充沛的革命生命力，鼓足干劲，把西藏高原建设成为人间的乐园。（经久不息的掌声）
    最后我祝愿在胜利扫荡西藏边远地区叛匪战斗迅速取得彻底的胜利，在新生的西藏的各项建设与改革事业和佛教飞跃发展。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
