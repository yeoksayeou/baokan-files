　　Potash Fertilizer Can Increase Plant Radioactivity
　　Improving Crop Yield and Quality
    Applying potash fertilizer to the soil can increase the natural radioactivity of plants (especially sugar beets and winter wheat). This conclusion was reached by Ukrainian biologist Academician Peter Vlasiuk.
    Multiple experiments by this biologist have proven that this increase in natural radioactivity has a significant effect on improving crop yield and quality. For example, as a result of applying potash fertilizer to increase the radioactivity of grain crops, the starch content in the harvested grain crops also increases even more. Similarly, the sugar content in sugar beets also increases even more.
    Vlasiuk has also created another method to influence plant growth processes using small amounts of radioactive irradiation, thereby increasing yield. He treats sugar beet seeds with phosphorus isotopes before sowing, and as a result, the harvest of these sugar beet seeds increases by an average of 16% compared to ordinary seeds, sometimes even up to 40%. Similarly, the harvest of wheat treated in this way can also increase by 10%.
    Vlasiuk also conducted this experiment on crops such as grapes, tea, and corn, and also obtained similar good results.

　　钾肥能增加植物放射性
　　提高农作物产量和质量
    把钾肥施到土壤中，能使植物的（特别是甜菜和冬小麦）天然放射性增加。这个结论是乌克兰生物学家彼德·符拉修克院士得出的。
    这位生物学家的多次试验证明，这种天然放射性的增加对提高农作物的产量和质量都有显著的效果。比如，谷类作物通过施钾肥使它的放射性增加的结果，收割的谷类作物中所含的淀粉也就增加得更多。同样，甜菜中所含的糖分也增加得更多。
    符拉修克还创造了另一种用少量的放射性照射来影响植物生长过程，从而提高产量的方法。他把甜菜种子经过磷的同位素处理后才进行播种，结果这种甜菜种子的收成比一般种子的收成平均提高16％，有时还提高到40％。同样，经过这种处理的小麦的收成也能提高10％。
    符拉修克还在葡萄、茶叶和玉米等作物中进行了这种试验，并且也获得了类似的良好效果。
