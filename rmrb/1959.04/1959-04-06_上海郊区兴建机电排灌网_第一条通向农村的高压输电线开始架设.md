Shanghai Suburbs Build Electromechanical Drainage and Irrigation Network
    First High-Voltage Power Line to Rural Areas Begins Construction

    (Our report) Shanghai's eleven suburban counties are constructing an electrical drainage and irrigation network covering one million mu of farmland. To ensure spring irrigation and not miss the farming season, the builders are striving to complete the first phase of the project before May 1st.

    This drainage and irrigation power grid requires the construction of more than 510 kilometers of overhead power lines, the vast majority of which are high-voltage lines, including more than 90 kilometers of 35,000-volt high-voltage lines and more than 300 kilometers of 10,000-volt or 6,600-volt lines. In addition, it requires the installation of 10,000 kVA main transformers and more than 200 distribution transformers. The electrical energy transmitted by this power grid is equivalent to the labor of 100,000 farmers and can power water pumps to irrigate or drain one million mu of farmland. Once completed, the farmland in the drainage and irrigation area can use electricity for drought and flood control.

    Also reported: The first 35,000-volt high-voltage transmission line erected in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs—the Shanghai-Songjiang-Qingpu line—has recently started construction.

    This high-voltage transmission line starts from the Minhang Power Plant in Shanghai and extends westward through Songjiang County to Qingpu County, with a total length of about 40 kilometers. The transmitted electrical energy is temporarily 2,500 kW capacity, with further development planned. Upon completion of this project, it can supply the currently urgently needed electricity for irrigating 50,000 mu of farmland in Songjiang County, as well as electricity for blast furnaces and for pumping water from 24 pumping stations in Qingpu County. In addition, it can also supply electricity to rural industries and a portion of the urban area.

    Also reported: A new type of semi-open-air power plant being built in Shanghai—the Minhang Power Plant—is under accelerated construction.

    The plant's workers are making a big technical revolution, breaking construction conventions, and adopting large-scale parallel and cross-operations of civil engineering and installation, greatly accelerating the construction progress. For example, in terms of civil engineering, it took only 19 days from breaking ground for the main plant building to the complete handover for installation, only 17 days from the start of the boiler to steam supply, only 32 hours and 40 minutes for the steam turbine installation, and only 39 days for the entire project from excavation to the first set of units generating electricity. Currently, workers are stepping up the installation of the second 12,000 kW unit.

    The first phase of this power plant, when fully completed, will have a power generation capacity of 100,000 kW, which can supply electricity for the production of seven iron and steel complexes with an annual output of 500,000 tons, or for the lighting of a city with ten million people.

### 上海郊区兴建机电排灌网  第一条通向农村的高压输电线开始架设

    上海郊区兴建机电排灌网
    第一条通向农村的高压输电线开始架设
    本报讯　上海市郊十一县正在兴建一个排涝灌溉面积达一百万亩农田的电力排涝灌溉网。为了保证春灌，不误农时，建设者们力争在“五一”前完成第一期工程。
    这个排涝灌溉电力网要新建架空供电线路五百一十多公里，而且极大部分都是高压电线路，其中三万五千伏高压的有九十多公里，一万伏或六千六百伏的达三百多公里；另外要装置一万千伏安的主变压器和二百多台配电变压器。这个电力网输送的电流能量相等于十万个农民的劳动力，可以开动抽水机为一百万亩农田灌溉或者排涝。这个电力网建成后，在排涝灌溉区内的农田就可以用电力抗旱防涝了。
    又讯　上海郊区农村架设的第一条三万五千伏高压输电线——上海—松江—青浦线，已在最近动工兴建。
    这条高压输电线路从上海闵行电厂开始，一直向西经过松江县城再延伸到青浦县城，全长约四十公里。输送电能暂时为二千五百瓩容量，以后再作发展。这项工程完成后，可以供应松江县目前急需供应的五万亩农田灌溉用电及高炉用电和青浦县二十四个水泵站的抽水用电；此外，还可以供给农村工业及城区一部分电力。
    又讯　上海新建的一座新型的半露天式发电厂——闵行发电厂正在加紧建设。
    建厂的职工大闹技术革命，打破施工常规，采取了大幅度的土建与安装平行交叉作业，大大加速了施工进度。如土建方面从主厂房破土到全部交付安装只有十九天，锅炉开工到供汽只有十七天，汽机安装只有三十二小时四十分，整个工程从挖土到第一套机发电只有三十九天。目前，职工正在加紧安装第二套一万二千瓩机组。
    这座电厂第一期工程全部建成后发电量为十万瓩，可供七个年产五十万吨的钢铁联合企业的生产用电，或一千万人口的城市照明。（附图片）
