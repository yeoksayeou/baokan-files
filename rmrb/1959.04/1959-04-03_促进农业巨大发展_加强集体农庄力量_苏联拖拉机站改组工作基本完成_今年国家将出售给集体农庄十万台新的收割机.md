(From our correspondent in Moscow, April 2nd) The reorganization of Soviet tractor stations has been basically completed. Now, as collective farms personally control machinery and equipment, production potential has been further developed, and the collective farm system has been further consolidated.

This was stated by Samoilov, Director of the Production Tool and Tractor Planning Division of the Economic Planning Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, when he met with our reporter on the first anniversary of the Soviet Supreme Soviet's passage of the law on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations. He said that since the reorganization of tractor stations in the Soviet Union in April last year until the beginning of this year, nearly 80% of the agricultural technical equipment of the tractor stations has been sold to collective farms, including 480,000 tractors and 211,000 grain harvesters. Due to the more rational distribution and use of these machines in the collective farms, labor productivity has been significantly improved. According to statistics, the utilization rate of tractors increased by 21.6%, and the utilization rate of harvesters increased by 18%. When collective farms obtain new machines, the production enthusiasm and initiative of the farms are greatly improved. Last year's bumper harvest was closely related to the reorganization of tractor stations.

Samoilov then said that before the reorganization of tractor stations, there were more than 9,000 tractor stations in the Soviet Union. At present, except for 81 tractor stations that are still preserved in a small number of areas, all of them have been reorganized into more than 3,800 machine repair stations and 1,900 branch stations. They serve the machine repair work of collective farms throughout the Soviet Union. After inspection, it has been proved that due to the supervision and planning of collective farms, this year's tractor repair work is better than in previous years. Not only was the overhaul task universally completed ahead of schedule before the spring plowing, but also the overhaul quality was good.

With the reorganization of tractor stations, the production planning system of collective farms has been fundamentally changed. This change is leading to the development of farmers' production enthusiasm and initiative. Earlier, the tractor station had the leadership in formulating the production plan of the collective farm, which often affected the production enthusiasm of the collective farm. Since the reorganization of the tractor station, this situation has been fundamentally changed. In the past year, the production plan revised by the collective farm itself on the basis of fully exploring production potential has greatly helped to increase agricultural output and reduce costs. Therefore, the income of collective farms has also increased significantly.

Samoilov added that due to the reorganization of tractor stations, nearly 2.5 million workers—tractor drivers and agronomists—have joined collective farms. This is a strong advanced technical force. They not only play a significant role in increasing the output of collective farms, but also play a significant role in strengthening the political and technical strength of collective farms.

He went on to say that in order to increase the yield of grain, cotton and other economic crops, integrated technical production teams have been established in various parts of the Soviet Union after the reorganization of tractor stations to realize the comprehensive mechanization of field production.

At present, collective farms in Ukraine alone have organized more than 18,000 comprehensive technical production teams for corn. Collective farms in various places have put forward requirements for new agricultural machinery for production according to different specific conditions. The connection between collective farms and the socialist industrial economy has been expanded. This year, the state will sell 160,000 new tractors and 100,000 new harvesters to collective farms. This will greatly strengthen the technical foundation of collective farms.

Samoilov finally said that the positive role played by the reorganization of tractor stations in rapidly developing agricultural production, consolidating the collective farm system, and improving the living standards of farmers in the past year proves the correctness of the Party's great measure. At present, in addition to consolidating the achievements of this reorganization, the agricultural departments of various Soviet republics are vigorously helping some collective farms with weak economic strength with technical cadres, so that their production can be developed as soon as possible and catch up with the advanced collective farms, so as to jointly realize the magnificent seven-year plan for agricultural development formulated by the Party.

In order to strengthen the technical foundation of collective farms, the Soviet Union is supplying collective farms with a large number of agricultural machines. The picture shows the new "Belarus" universal tractor produced by the Minsk Tractor Factory. These tractors are about to be shipped to farms all over the country.

    促进农业巨大发展　加强集体农庄力量
    苏联拖拉机站改组工作基本完成
    今年国家将出售给集体农庄十万台新的收割机
    本报莫斯科2日电　苏联拖拉机站改组工作已经基本完成。现在，由于集体农庄亲自掌握了机器设备，生产潜力进一步得到发挥，集体农庄制度也进一步获得巩固。
    这是苏联农业部经济计划局生产工具和拖拉机计划处主任萨莫伊洛夫在苏联最高苏维埃通过关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站法律一周年接见本报记者时说的。他说，自去年4月苏联实行拖拉机站改组截至今年初，拖拉机站的将近80％的农业技术设备已经出售给了集体农庄，其中包括四十八万台拖拉机和二十一万一千架谷物收割机。由于这些机器在集体农庄自己更合理地支配使用下，劳动生产率已有显著提高。据统计，拖拉机的利用率提高21.6％，收割机利用率提高18％。当集体农庄获得机器的新情况下，农庄的生产积极性和主动性也大大提高。去年的农业大丰收正是与拖拉机站进行改组息息相关的。
    萨莫伊洛夫接着说，拖拉机站改组前，全苏共有九千多个拖拉机站。目前，除了小部分地区还保存着八十一个拖拉机站之外，已全部改组成了三千八百多个机器修理站和一千九百个分站。它们为全苏集体农庄的机器修理工作服务，经过检查证明，由于集体农庄的监督和计划得好，这年度的拖拉机修理工作作得比往年要好，不但在春耕前普遍提前完成了检修任务，而且检修质量良好。
    随着拖拉机站的改组，集体农庄的生产计划制度得到根本的改变。这种改变正导至农庄生产积极性和主动性的发挥。早先拖拉机站是负有制订集体农庄生产计划方面的领导权，因此这就往往影响了集体农庄的生产积极性。自从拖拉机站改组后，这种情况得到了根本改变。这一年来，在根据充分发掘生产潜力基础上集体农庄自己修订的生产计划大大有助于农业产量提高、成本减低。因此，集体农庄的收入也有了显著增加。
    萨莫伊洛夫又说，由于拖拉机站的改组，将近有二百五十万工人——拖拉机手、农艺师加入了集体农庄。这是一批强大的先进技术力量。他们不仅对集体农庄提高产量方面起着很大作用，而且在加强集体农庄政治、技术力量方面也起着显著的作用。
    他接着说，为了提高谷物、棉花和其它经济作物的产量，苏联各地在拖拉机站改组后纷纷成立综合技术生产队，实现田间生产全面机械化。
    目前，仅乌克兰各地集体农庄已经组织起了一万八千多个玉米综合技术生产队。各地集体农庄根据不同的具体条件提出了对生产新的农业机械的要求。集体农庄与社会主义工业经济的联系有了扩大。今年，国家将出售给集体农庄十六万台新的拖拉机和十万台新的收割机。这将大大加强集体农庄技术基础。
    萨莫伊洛夫最后说，拖拉机站改组一年来，在迅速发展农业生产、巩固集体农庄制度以及提高庄员生活水平等方面所起的积极作用，证明党的这一巨大措施的正确。目前，苏联各共和国农业部门除了巩固这一改组成就外，正在从技术干部上大力帮助一些经济实力较弱的集体农庄，使其生产尽快地发展并赶上先进的集体农庄，以便共同提前实现党所制定的雄伟的农业发展七年计划。（附图片）
