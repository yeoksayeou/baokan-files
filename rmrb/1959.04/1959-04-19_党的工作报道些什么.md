　　What Should Party Work Reports Cover?

　　Some readers have written to request that this newspaper strengthen its coverage of experiences in Party organization work. Our plan is to focus on reporting the work experiences of the Party in factories and mines, people's communes, and schools. The main areas of reporting are: how commune Party organizations carry out their work adapting to the situation of "unified leadership, decentralized management"; the experiences and achievements of Party organizations and leading cadres in factories, mines, communes and schools in further improving their leadership methods and working methods; how cadres in communes and factories and mines further strengthen their ties with the masses after rectification campaigns and after leading cadres participate in productive labor; the development of new Party members and the education of probationary Party members; the political and ideological work of the Party in the movement to increase production and practice economy and in the technical innovation movement, and so on. Some reports in these areas have already appeared in the newspaper recently. We hope that readers will write articles on these topics for this newspaper.

　　党的工作报道些什么
    有些读者来信，要求本报加强党组织工作经验的报道。我们的打算是，目前着重报道党在厂矿企业、人民公社、学校中的工作经验。主要报道方面有：适应“统一领导、分级管理”的情况，公社党组织如何进行工作；厂矿、公社、学校中的党组织和领导干部进一步改善领导方法、工作方法的经验和成效；经过整社、经过领导干部参加生产劳动后，公社和厂矿的干部如何进一步密切联系群众；发展新党员，对预备党员的教育；党在增产节约、技术革新运动中的政治思想工作，等等。最近已经陆续有一些报道见报。希望读者为本报撰写一些这方面的稿件。
