To the Editor:

    As a Hui soldier, I, like all my fellow countrymen of all ethnic groups, am overjoyed by the swift suppression of the rebellion launched by the reactionary upper strata of Tibet by our army, and I celebrate the new life of Tibet with my Tibetan compatriots!

    However, regrettably, recently there have been many activities in India that use the Tibetan rebellion incident to oppose our country and undermine Sino-Indian friendly relations. Our government and people, valuing Sino-Indian friendship, have shown the utmost restraint until now. However, these mad expansionists have regarded China's tolerance as weakness and vulnerability. Not only do they not know how to restrain themselves, they have intensified their efforts. Even Indian government officials have engaged in the dirty trick of distributing the so-called Dalai Lama's statement. Certain leaders of the Indian ruling party, the Congress Party, have openly denied our country's sovereignty over Tibet. The General Secretary of the Congress Party even said at a public gathering: "The Congress Party will not hesitate to announce China's atrocities in Tibet to the world." This is a completely shameless act of interfering in our internal affairs. We cannot but express our utmost indignation and resolute protest against these Indian expansionists who interfere in our internal affairs and undermine Sino-Indian friendly relations! I want to solemnly warn the Indian expansionists that in the face of the great Chinese people, any attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs and split China's unity will inevitably be met with shameful failure!

    不许印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政编辑同志：
    作为一个回族战士，我和祖国各族同胞一样，为我军迅速平息了西藏上层反动集团发动的叛乱而欢欣鼓舞，我和藏族同胞一起欢庆西藏的新生！
    但是，令人遗憾的是：最近一个时期在印度出现了许多利用西藏叛乱事件反对我国，破坏中印友好关系的活动。我国政府和人民以中印友谊为重，在此以前表现了最大的克制。但是，这些丧心病狂的扩张主义分子，却把中国的忍让看成了软弱可欺，不但不知检点，竟而变本加厉，甚至印度政府官员也干出了散发所谓达赖喇嘛声明这样肮脏的勾当，印度执政党国大党的某些领袖更公然否认我国对西藏的主权。国大党的总书记还在公众集会上说：“国大党将毫不犹豫地向世界宣布中国在西藏的暴行”。这完全是干涉我国内政的无耻行动。对于这些干涉我国内政、破坏中印友好关系的印度扩张主义分子，我们不能不表示无比的愤慨和坚决的抗议！我要严正地警告印度扩张主义分子，在伟大的中国人民面前，任何干涉中国内政、分裂中国统一的企图，都必将遭到可耻的失败！
