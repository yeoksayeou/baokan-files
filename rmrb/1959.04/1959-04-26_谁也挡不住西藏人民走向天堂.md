To the Editors:

    The recent counter-revolutionary rebellion in Tibet has aroused immense anger among us students studying in the Soviet Union. We resolutely support the government in wiping out the small handful of reactionary elements in Tibet who represent the interests of the feudal serf owners and are instigated by imperialism. We are particularly pleased these days because this small group of traitors has finally been suppressed by the people. Although some heinous traitors have fled abroad, they ultimately cannot stop the torrent of the Tibetan people demanding liberation from the evil system of exploitation.

    The Tibetan people have now gained true freedom and liberation. The Tibetan people are singing loudly, singing of the Party's wise leadership bringing unparalleled happiness to the Tibetan people; singing of a bright future. We deeply believe that the Tibetan people will unite more closely around the Party, and together with the people of all fraternal nationalities across the country, will rapidly enter humanity's paradise – socialism and communism!

    The Party's leadership is the source of happiness for the great unity of all nationalities in the country. A new page of history has unfolded for the Tibetan people, and they will advance by leaps and bounds alongside the people of the whole country. The more imperialism tries to undermine our unity, the more united we become. It has become our negative teacher. Let imperialism and foreign reactionaries tremble!

    谁也挡不住西藏人民走向天堂编辑同志：
    最近在西藏发生的反革命叛乱事件，激起我们在苏联学习的同学无比的愤怒，我们坚决拥护政府肃清西藏一小撮代表封建大农奴主利益、并受帝国主义指使的反动分子。近日我们格外高兴，因为这一小撮叛国分子终于被人民肃平了，虽然还有些罪大恶极的叛国分子逃往国外，但他们终究不能阻挡西藏人民要求从万恶的剥削制度下获得解放的洪流。
    西藏人民今天获得真正的自由与解放了，西藏人民在引吭高歌，他们歌唱党的英明领导给西藏人民带来的无比幸福；歌唱未来的美好生活。我们深信西藏人民将更紧密地团结在党的周围，与全国各兄弟民族人民一道飞快地进入人类的天堂——社会主义与共产主义！
    党的领导是全国各民族大团结的幸福源泉，新的一页历史已向西藏人民展开了，他们将与全国人民一道一日千里地大跃进。帝国主义越想破坏我们的团结，结果反而促使我们更加团结，它成了我们的反面教员，让帝国主义和外国反动派发抖吧！
