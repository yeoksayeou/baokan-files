Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 27th: Following the rebellion in Tibet, some Pakistani newspapers have resorted to imperialist propaganda clichés, distorted the truth, and viciously attacked China.

The "Review" evening newspaper, published in Karachi, has continuously published articles and editorials slandering and defaming China. Ignoring the fact that Tibet has always been an integral part of Chinese territory, it insists that Tibet is a "country." It smears the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951 as "aggression against this country," and even fabricates that this poses a "difficult problem" for the "security" of Pakistan and India.

This newspaper shamelessly echoes the imperialist rhetoric of vilifying China, saying that China is an "imperialist and colonialist," and even viciously curses the Chinese people as "Red Chinese bandits." It also concocts rumors, saying that the Chinese are carrying out so-called "large-scale destruction," "large-scale massacres," "blasphemy," and "occupation of monasteries" in the Tibetan region.

This newspaper describes a small number of rebellious elements in Tibet as "Tibetan freedom fighters," and expresses great "sadness" at the People's Liberation Army's rapid suppression of the rebellion in Tibet. Like a madman who has lost his mind, this newspaper, in its editorial on April 22, actually compares the People's Republic of China to Hitler's Germany, wartime Japan, and Mussolini's Italy. It fantasizes that communism "is built on mud" and will "collapse" at any time.

In order to slander China, this newspaper does not hesitate to spread blatant lies, saying that Premier Zhou Enlai, during his visit to India in 1954, "divided some parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia" with Prime Minister Nehru.

Some Pakistani newspapers are also doing their best to stir up trouble and incite India to oppose China. The Urdu "Jang" newspaper, in its editorial on April 24, accused Prime Minister Nehru of adopting "ridiculous double-dealing tactics" in Sino-Indian relations.

    巴基斯坦一些报纸恶毒之至
    谩骂我国人民为“匪徒”
    新华社27日讯　卡拉奇消息：在西藏叛乱事件发生以后，巴基斯坦一些报纸搬用帝国主义的宣传滥调，颠倒黑白，恶毒地攻击中国。
    在卡拉奇出版的“评论”晚报连续发表文章和社论，诬蔑诽谤中国。它无视西藏历来就是中国领土的一部分这一事实，硬说西藏是一个“国家”，它污蔑1951年和平解放西藏是“侵略了这个国家”，还胡诌说，这对巴基斯坦和印度的“安全”提出了一个“难办的问题”。
    这家报纸可耻地学着帝国主义谩骂中国的腔调，说什么中国是“帝国主义者和殖民主义者”，甚至恶毒地咒骂中国人民是“赤色中国匪徒”。它还编造谣言，说什么中国人在西藏地区进行所谓“大规模的毁灭”，“大规模屠杀”、“亵渎神灵”，“占领寺院”。
    这家报纸把西藏一小撮的叛乱分子说成是“西藏的自由战士”，对人民解放军迅速平定西藏的叛乱表示十分“悲伤”。这家报纸像失去理智的疯人一样，在它4月22日的社论中，居然把中华人民共和国比成希特勒的德国、战时的日本和墨索里尼的意大利。它幻想共产主义“是建立在烂泥上的”，随时会“垮台”。
    为了诽谤中国，这家报纸不惜撒下弥天大谎，说什么周恩来总理在1954年访问印度时，曾经和尼赫鲁总理“瓜分了中东和东南亚的一些部分”。
    巴基斯坦一些报纸还竭力煽风点火，怂恿印度反对中国。乌尔都文“战斗报”在4月24日的社论中，指责尼赫鲁总理在中印两国关系方面采取了“可笑的两面派的做法”。
