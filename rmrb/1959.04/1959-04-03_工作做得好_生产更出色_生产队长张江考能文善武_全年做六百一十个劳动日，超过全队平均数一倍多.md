    Doing a Good Job Leads to Better Production
    Production Team Leader Zhang Jiangkao is Skilled in Both Literary and Military Affairs
    Completes 610 Workdays in a Year, More Than Double the Team's Average
    This newspaper reports that in the Xigou Jinxing People's Commune in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, led by the nationally renowned agricultural labor model Li Shunda, there is a production team leader named Zhang Jiangkao who is skilled in both literary and military affairs. To say he is skilled in literary affairs is to say that he can firmly implement the Party's various policies, is good at connecting with the masses, cares about the lives of the masses, and leads by example in everything he does. To say he is skilled in military affairs is to say that his labor is good, he has resilience, and he can do practical and hard work. In addition to being responsible for the team's leadership work, he also completed 610 workdays in a year (from October 1957 to October 1958), making him the one who worked the most workdays in the entire team. These 610 workdays came from: 333 days participating in field labor: including 245 days in his own group and 88 days rotating to various groups; 125 days participating in water conservancy infrastructure construction labor; and 152 days feeding livestock. This year, he is determined to continue to use the experience he gained last year in participating in production and leading production to ensure that he does a good job in the brigade's work and strives to complete 650 workdays throughout the year.
    As a production team leader of 83 households (formerly the director of the Dongpo Village Advanced Cooperative), why is Zhang Jiangkao able to do more labor days than ordinary commune members? Is it that he only cares about participating in labor and affects his work? When the reporter asked Comrade Zhang Jiangkao these questions, he said: "Whether it is the director of an advanced cooperative or the production team leader of a commune, the main task is to lead the masses to do a good job in production. If production is done well, it proves that you are doing a good job; if production is not done well, it also shows that your work has not been done well." However, before last year, he did not have such a clear understanding. Therefore, although he had a habit of diligence, he often participated in labor after becoming the director of the cooperative, but the number of workdays he did was only about 300. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the Party called on cadres to participate in physical labor and to lead production with production. Zhang Jiangkao is a Communist Party member and was the director of the cooperative at the time. He actively responded to the Party's call, determined to leave the office, move the office to the fields, and work while working. After research by the Management Committee, in addition to holding regular meetings of the Management Committee, a system of meeting every three days, checking every five days, and arranging every ten days was established with each production team to regularly understand the completion of tasks and the problems that exist in each period, and to arrange tasks for the next stage. And these things generally do not take up daytime hours. For example, the implementation of instructions from the higher Party committee, the arrangement of production, the announcement of accounts, and a series of work such as propaganda and mobilization are all carried out at meal breaks, in the fields, and on construction sites. When there are major issues that need to be resolved by convening a meeting, it is generally held at night, and the meeting time does not exceed two hours at most. In this way, doing work kicks away the confines of the office, making the work done well and saving the time of cadres and commune members.
    While moving the office to the field to solve problems on the spot, he paid great attention to giving play to the role of lower-level cadres and Party members and Youth League members. For example, under the principle of collective leadership, all cadres implemented a responsibility system of division of labor, year-round contracting, and monthly and quarterly evaluation and inspection; all Party members and Youth League members implemented a responsibility system of contracting households to ensure full attendance and a large amount and high quality of labor. In this way, both collective wisdom was brought into play and everyone's enthusiasm was improved.
    After adopting the above methods, Comrade Zhang Jiangkao freed up more time to participate in labor. However, this production team of 83 households includes six production groups and is distributed in four small mountain villages. As an all-round leader, it is necessary to go deep down to rely on a key point, but it is impossible to stick to one place. Therefore, Comrade Jiangkao, according to the division of labor, in addition to working and laboring in the Dongpo production group, also adopted a method of combining rotating labor with rotating inspection work, working wherever he went and laboring there first. During the busy farming season, he generally went to each group to labor for one day every three to seven days, and during the slack season, he went every ten days or half a month. Problems existing in each group were solved through rotating labor. When spring plowing and sowing were carried out last year, the county party committee called for all corn to be planted densely with double seedlings. Because the Xigou and Xiling groups had not grown it before, did not understand the technology, and were afraid that planting it would not be safe, they did not plant it. After Comrade Jiangkao discovered this, he went to Xigou and Xiling to work in rotation, living for three days in each place, teaching them the technology of dense planting with double seedlings, and planting all the corn on time and with high quality. No matter which group he went to to check and solve problems, he appeared as a cadre; when he labored, he was like an ordinary commune member, obeying the command and mobilization of the group leader, doing whatever the group leader asked him to do, and doing whatever needed to be done. From sowing, hoeing seedlings, topdressing, harvesting to carrying water to the canteen... etc., he did everything; he was concerned about all kinds of problems in production and even the family life problems of the commune members.
    Leading by example is one of Comrade Jiangkao's greatest characteristics. He was born into a poor peasant family, herded sheep, is a good hand at farming, and has excellent qualities of diligence and bravery. He is loyal to the Party's cause and can modelly implement the Party's policies and guidelines, leading the masses to carry out selfless labor. He said: "When you become a cadre, you have greater responsibilities, but you can't rely on gesticulating and being a hands-off manager; you can only walk in front of the masses, not fall behind the masses; you can only do more than the masses, not do less than the masses. If you fall behind the masses and do less than the masses, what kind of cadre are you?" Because of this, he takes the lead in everything, leads everywhere, and influences the masses with his own exemplary actions. In the winter of 1957, it was decided to build a dam 73 zhang long and about 3.5 zhang high in the river beach at the foot of Dongpo Village. It was planned to be completed from the tenth lunar month to Qingming of the following year. This was a great thing to do. But at that time, it was already the twelfth lunar month, and the weather was freezing cold, and no one dared to take on this task. Comrade Jiangkao felt that if it was not repaired now, and construction would not begin until the spring was warm and the flowers were blooming, the project and spring plowing and sowing would coincide, resulting in insufficient labor and the inability to complete it once the flood came. Sixty mu of land would be in danger of being washed away by the river, and 300 mu of land could not be repaired. What a great loss! Thinking of this, he believed that it could only be advanced, not postponed. Therefore, he personally led this construction project, overcame various difficulties, and finally completed it 75 days ahead of schedule. In the spring of last year, there were two thin and weak livestock in the cooperative, and no one wanted to feed them, so Jiangkao brought them to his own home and carefully raised them. In order to solve the problem of forage, he went out early and returned late in the summer, using his lunch break to cut more than 8,000 jin of green grass and feed the two livestock until they were fat and strong.
    Last year, under his influence and leadership, the attendance rate of commune members improved significantly. Accountant Zhang Erhu worked more than 500 workdays, and the labor force that worked more than 400 workdays accounted for more than 20% of the total labor force. The average number of workdays per labor force in the entire team was 290, and the total number of workdays increased by 45% compared with 1957.
    Due to the increased labor attendance rate of commune members, hard work and practical work, the Dongpo production team achieved a bumper harvest during the Great Leap Forward last year. The yield per mu of the entire team increased from 403 jin in 1957 to 616 jin, and the average ration of food per commune member increased from 380 jin to 450 jin. When the income of commune members increased and their lives improved, they all unanimously thought of the merits of their team leader. In Dongpo Village, there is a saying that goes: "As long as Jiangkao says something, we will do whatever he asks us to do." This simple language fully shows that the excellent Communist Party member Zhang Jiangkao has established close ties with the masses, and he has truly played the role of a "locomotive."

    工作做得好　生产更出色
    生产队长张江考能文善武
    全年做六百一十个劳动日，超过全队平均数一倍多
    本报讯　全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达所领导的山西壶关县西沟金星人民公社，有个能文能武的生产队长，他的名字叫张江考。说他能文，是他能坚定地贯彻党的各项政策，善于联系群众，关心群众生活，事事处处以身作则；说他能武，是他的劳动好，有韧性，能实干苦干，他除担负全队领导工作外，在一年中还做了劳动日六百一十个（从1957年10月至1958年10月），是全队做劳动日最多的一个。这六百一十个劳动日来源是：参加田间劳动三百三十三个：其中在本组二百四十五个，巡回到各组八十八个；参加水利基本建设劳动一百二十五个；喂牲口一百五十二个。今年，他决心继续运用去年参加生产领导生产的经验，保证搞好大队工作，争取全年做六百五十个劳动日。
    张江考作为一个八十三户的生产队长（原东坡村高级社主任），为什么能够比一般社员还做得劳动
  日多呢？是不是只管自己参加劳动，而影响到工作呢？当记者向张江考同志提出这些问题时，他说：“不管是高级社主任，还是公社的生产队长，工作任务主要是带领群众把生产搞好。生产搞好了，证明你工作做得好；生产搞得不好，那也就说明你的工作没有做好。”可是，在去年以前，他还没有这样明确的认识，因此，尽管他有勤劳的习惯，当了社主任以后也经常参加劳动，但做的劳动日也不过三百个。去年大跃进中，党号召干部参加体力劳动，要以生产领导生产。张江考是共产党员，当时又是社主任。他积极响应了党的号召，下决心走出办公室，把办公室搬到田间，一边劳动，一边工作。经过管理委员会的研究，除了定期召开管理委员会以外，又和各个生产队建立了三天一接头，五天一检查，十天一安排的制度，经常了解各个时期的任务完成情况和存在的问题，安排下段任务。而这些事情，一般都不占用白天的时间。例如，贯彻执行上级党委的指示，安排生产，公布账目，以及宣传鼓动等一系列的工作，就都是利用饭场、地头、工地进行的；遇有需要召开会议解决的重大问题，一般都放在晚上，会议时间最多不超过两小时。这样，做工作就踢开了办公室的圈子，使工作做得又好，又节省了干部和社员的时间。
    与办公室搬到田间就地解决问题的同时，他十分注意发挥下层干部和党团员的作用。例如，全体干部在集体领导的原则下，实行了分工负责、常年包干、按月按季评比检查的责任制；全体党团员，则实行了分户包出勤全、包劳动数量多质量高的责任制。这样，既发挥了集体智慧，又提高了大家的积极性。
    采取上述办法以后。张江考同志就腾出了更多的时间参加劳动。但是，这个八十三户的生产队，包括着六个生产小组，又分布在四个小山庄上。作为一个全面领导人，要深入下去依托一个重点，又不能死守在一个地方。于是，江考同志按照分工，除固定在东坡生产小组工作和劳动以外，还采取了巡回劳动和巡回检查工作相结合的办法，工作到哪里，首先劳动到哪里。在农忙时期，一般每隔三天至七天到各组劳动一天，农闲时就隔十天或者半个月。通过巡回劳动解决各组存在的问题。去年春耕下种的时候，县委号召全部玉茭要双株密植，西沟、西岭小组因为过去没有种过，不懂技术，又怕种上不大保险，结果没有种。江考同志发现以后，就到西沟、西岭轮流劳动，各住了三天，教会他们双株密植技术，按时按质地把玉茭全部种上。他不管到哪个组检查解决问题的时候，就以干部的身份出现；劳动的时候，即和一个普通社员一样，服从组长指挥、调动，组长让干什么就干什么，需要干什么就干什么。从下种、锄苗、追肥、收割一直到给食堂担水……等等，他什么也干；生产当中的各种问题以至社员们的家庭生活问题，样样他都关心。
    以身作则带头干，是江考同志的一个最大特点。他，出生于贫农家庭，放过羊，是种地的好把式，具有勤劳勇敢的优良品质；他，忠于党的事业，能够模范地执行党的方针、政策，带领群众进行忘我的劳动。他说：“当了干部，负的责任大了，但不能靠指手划脚，当甩手掌柜；只能走在群众的前头，不能落在群众的后头；只能比群众做得多，不能比群众做得少。落在群众后面，做事不如群众多，那还算什么干部？”正因为如此，他事事带头，处处带头，并以自己的模范行动来影响群众。1957年冬天，决定在东坡村角下的河滩里，修一道七十三丈长、三丈五尺左右高的大坝。计划从阴历10月起到第二年清明完成。这是一件大好事。但当时已经是腊月天寒地冻的时候了，谁也不敢担当这一任务。江考同志觉得：现在不修，等到春暖花开再动工，工程和春耕下种碰在一起，一来劳力不足，二来洪水一发，就干不成了。六十亩地有被河冲的危险，三百亩地也修不成。这是多大的损失呀！想到这里，他认为只能提前，不能推后。因此，他亲自领导这项建设工程，克服种种困难，终于提前七十五天修成了。去年春天，社里有两头瘦弱牲口，谁也不愿意喂，江考就拉到自己家里，精心喂养起来。他为了解决饲草问题，夏天早出晚归，利用中午休息时间，共割青草八千多斤，把两头牲口喂得又肥又胖。
    去年，在他的影响和带动下，社员们的出勤率有了显著提高。会计张二虎做了五百多个劳动日，做到四百个劳动日以上的劳力，占到劳力总数的20％以上。全队每个劳动力平均做劳动日二百九十个，劳动日总数比1957年提高了45％。
    由于社员劳动出勤率提高，苦干实干，去年大跃进中，东坡生产队获得了特大丰收。全队亩产量由1957年的四百零三斤提高到六百一十六斤，社员每人平均口粮由三百八十斤提高到四百五十斤。当社员们收入增加、生活改善的时候，不约而同的想到他们的队长的功劳。在东坡村，流传着一种说法：“只要江考说句话，叫咱干啥就干啥。”这句朴素的语言里，充分说明，优秀的共产党员张江考，已经和群众建立了密切的联系，他已真正起到“火车头”的作用。
