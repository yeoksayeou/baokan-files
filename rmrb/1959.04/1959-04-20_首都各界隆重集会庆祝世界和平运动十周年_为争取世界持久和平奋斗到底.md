Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: More than 1,200 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally this morning at the Capital Theater to warmly celebrate the brilliant victory of the World Peace Movement, on the eve of its tenth anniversary. They expressed that the 600 million Chinese people will, together with peace-loving people around the world, continue to hold high the banner of safeguarding peace and opposing aggression, and fight to the end for the realization of lasting world peace.

The Capital Theater was decorated solemnly and simply today. In the center of the rostrum was a peace dove flag and the inscription "1949-1959." Opposite it, a huge red banner read: "Long Live World Peace!" This symbolizes that since the World Peace Congresses held simultaneously in Paris and Prague in late April 1949, the cause of safeguarding world peace has been taken up by hundreds of millions of people, and the World Peace Movement has become an irresistible torrent.

Many well-known peace figures from home and abroad, representatives of workers in the capital, and representatives from all walks of life, including women, youth, science, and the arts, attended the meeting. Among them were Guo Moruo, Liao Chengzhi, Chen Shutong, Liu Ningyi, Mao Dun, Shao Lizi, Cai Tingkai, Liu Changsheng, Chu Tunan, Wu Han, Lao She, Qian Sanqiang, Xirao Gyatso, Hou Debang, Wu Yaozong, Liu Qingyang, Jin Zhonghua, Zhang Chao, Liu Baojiang, and Qu Tangliang.

Also invited to attend the meeting were prominent peace figures from various countries, including Andréson, Chairman of the Icelandic Peace Committee and member of the World Peace Council, and his wife; Kinkazu Saionji, a Japanese peace activist and Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee; Ko Bong Giu, a Korean peace activist; Eyre, Vice-Chairman of the New Zealand Peace Committee and member of the World Peace Council, and his wife; Freer, Vice-Chairman of the New Zealand Peace Committee, and his wife; the renowned African-American scholar and member of the World Peace Council, W.E.B. Du Bois; and Mrs. Du Bois.

The meeting was presided over by Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. In his opening remarks, he expressed full support for the World Peace Council for its unremitting efforts to ease international tensions, oppose war, and safeguard world peace, and wished the World Peace Movement further development.

Amidst warm applause, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, took the stage to speak.

In reviewing the development of the World Peace Movement over the past decade, Guo Moruo said that the World Peace Movement has become a broad mass movement encompassing people from all walks of life. Today, maintaining world peace has become the common aspiration of the vast number of workers, peasants, women, youth, intellectuals, and people of other strata in various countries around the world. In recent years, many new organizations and movements striving for peace have also emerged around the world. Whenever imperialism creates tensions and seriously threatens peace, the united and resolute struggle of people around the world, especially the unremitting efforts made by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union to safeguard peace, have repeatedly foiled the war and aggression plans of imperialism and defended world peace.

In his speech, Guo Moruo particularly mentioned the great efforts and contributions made by the World Peace Council in maintaining world peace, supporting the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for national independence, and in strengthening international cooperation and developing friendship and unity among the peoples of all countries. He expressed deep remembrance and respect for the outstanding peace fighter, Professor Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, who passed away last year.

Guo Moruo continued, "The current international situation is conducive to the struggle for world peace. Now, the East Wind has further prevailed over the West Wind, and the forces of peace have greatly surpassed the forces of war. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the most reliable force for defending world peace. It encourages the victorious confidence of people around the world in opposing aggression and defending peace. With the strong support of the socialist camp, the national independence movement and the mass movements of people in various countries around the world striving for peace have converged into an irresistible powerful force, like rivers flowing into the sea, magnificent and surging, vigorously defending world peace, and repeatedly thwarting the imperialist policy of aggression and expansion."

In his speech, Guo Moruo severely condemned U.S. imperialism's vain attempts to realize its ambition of dominating the world and its persistent obstruction of the easing of international tensions. He condemned U.S. imperialism for repeatedly rejecting the positive proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on issues of greatest concern to people around the world, such as the cessation of testing and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, disarmament, and the withdrawal and cancellation of foreign troops and military bases on the territory of other countries. He condemned U.S. imperialism for its aggressive conspiracies and war activities around the world. Guo Moruo cited various facts and the history since World War II to prove that U.S. imperialism's policy of expansion and aggression is the root cause of new wars, that U.S. imperialism has become the most vicious enemy of world peace, and the most vicious enemy of the national independence movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Guo Moruo said, "However, the war threats of U.S. imperialism cannot scare the people of all countries striving for peace, and its deceptions and conspiracies are being seen through by more and more people. Today, although U.S. imperialism is still making frantic death throes, it has absolutely no way to escape the historical destiny of heading towards extinction. It will inevitably follow the path of making trouble, failing, making trouble again, and failing again, until its final demise."

Guo Moruo said with full confidence, "In today's situation where the forces of peace outweigh the forces of war, a bright and splendid prospect is unfolding before the people of the world. As long as the peace-loving people of the world unite and persist in their struggle, the cause of world peace will surely achieve greater victories."

Guo Moruo said, "Our people fully support our government's peaceful construction policy and peaceful diplomatic policy. We resolutely oppose the policy of war and aggression pursued by imperialism headed by the United States, and we firmly support the just struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for national independence. We warmly support the World Peace Council's proposals on disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, the convening of a summit conference of major powers, the ending of the Cold War, and the strengthening of international cooperation, which are conducive to easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace. We fully support the Soviet Union's proposals on signing a peace treaty with Germany, establishing a European collective security system, and establishing peace zones and nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Far East and the entire Pacific region."

Guo Moruo concluded, "Our people are engaged in the peaceful construction of our great motherland with soaring enthusiasm. We are constantly strengthening the forces of peace and defending world peace through this practical action of the whole people. The Chinese people deeply understand that only when our motherland is stronger, and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is stronger, will imperialism not dare to invade us, not dare to risk launching a new world war, and will world peace have a more reliable guarantee. The Chinese people will continue to contribute our share of strength, unite more closely with all peace-loving people around the world, and fight to the end for lasting world peace!"

Liu Baojiang, a representative of workers from the Beijing Iron and Steel Plant, Liu Qingyang, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Qian Sanqiang, a Chinese atomic physicist, and Lao She, a writer, also spoke at the meeting.

Liu Baojiang said that the Chinese working class, which has long suffered from imperialist oppression and the ravages of wars of aggression, was and will remain a staunch defender of world peace. He expressed that the Chinese workers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will engage in peaceful construction with greater enthusiasm and higher wisdom.

Liu Qingyang said that peace-loving Chinese women are, together with the people of the whole country, going all out, aiming high, and striving to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland, to make the lives of women and children happier and better, and to defend world peace.

Qian Sanqiang said that in today's world, where scientific undertakings have made rapid progress, and in an era when mankind has mastered atomic energy, science can only have broader development if it serves peace and the happy lives of the working people. He expressed that Chinese scientific workers will unremittingly make science and technology serve the socialist construction of the motherland and contribute their strength to defending world peace.

Lao She said that loving nature, loving peace, and loving life are the traditional spirit of our country's literature and art. We cherish this tradition, and we need a peaceful environment. Like the people of the whole country, Chinese literary and art workers love peace and resolutely oppose imperialist aggression.

Throughout the speeches of Guo Moruo and others, the hall resounded with warm applause, carrying the kind wishes of everyone and demonstrating a strong will to maintain peace and a firm confidence in victory.

　　首都各界隆重集会庆祝世界和平运动十周年
　　为争取世界持久和平奋斗到底
    新华社19日讯　在世界和平运动十周年的前夕，首都各界人民一千二百多人今天上午在首都剧场隆重举行集会，热烈庆祝世界和平运动的辉煌胜利，表示六亿中国人民将和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，继续高举着维护和平、反对侵略的大旗，为实现世界的持久和平奋斗到底。
    首都剧场今天布置得庄严、朴素，主席台正中央高悬和平鸽旗和“1949—1959”字样，对面巨大的红色横幅上写着：“世界和平万岁！”它象征着，从1949年4月下旬在巴黎和布拉格同时举行世界保卫和平大会以来，维护世界的和平事业已为亿万人民担当起来，世界和平运动已成为不可抗拒的洪流。
    许多国内外著名的和平人士，首都工人代表和妇女、青年、科学、文艺等各界的代表，出席了大会，他们当中有郭沫若、廖承志、陈叔通、刘宁一、茅盾、邵力子、蔡廷锴、刘长胜、楚图南、吴晗、老舍、钱三强、喜饶嘉错、侯德榜、吴耀宗、刘清扬、金仲华、张超、刘宝江、区棠亮等。
    应邀出席大会的还有各国著名的和平人士，他们当中有冰岛和平委员会主席、世界和平理事会理事安德烈逊和他的夫人，日本和平人士、亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会副秘书长西园寺公一，朝鲜和平人士高凤九，新西兰和平委员会副主席、世界和平理事会理事艾雷和他的夫人，新西兰和平委员会副主席弗里尔和他的夫人，美国著名黑人学者、世界和平理事会理事杜波伊斯，世界和平理事会理事杜波伊斯夫人等。
    大会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会北京市分会主席张奚若主持，他在大会开始时的致词中，对为缓和国际紧张局势、反对战争和维护世界和平而奋斗不懈的世界和平理事会表示全力支持，并祝世界和平运动获得进一步发展。
    在一片热烈的掌声中，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若登台讲话。
    郭沫若在回顾十年来世界和平运动的发展时说，十年来，世界和平运动已经成为一个广泛的、包括各阶层人民的群众运动。现在，维护世界和平已经成为世界各国广大工人、农民、妇女、青年、知识分子和其他阶层人士的普遍愿望。近年来在世界各地还出现了许多争取和平的新的组织和运动。每当帝国主义制造紧张局势使和平受到严重威胁的时候，全世界人民联合一致的坚决斗争，特别是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营为维护和平所作的不懈努力，一次又一次地挫败了帝国主义的战争和侵略计划，保卫了世界和平。
    郭沫若在讲话中特别提到了世界和平理事会在维护世界和平事业、支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争、在加强国际合作和发展各国人民友好团结方面所作的巨大努力和贡献。他对去年逝世的卓越的和平战士、世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里教授表示深切的怀念和敬意。
　　郭沫若接着说，当前的国际局势有利于争取世界和平的斗争。现在东风已经进一步压倒西风，和平力量已经大大超过战争力量。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，是保卫世界和平的最可靠的力量，它鼓舞着全世界人民反对侵略、保卫和平的胜利信心。在社会主义阵营强有力的支持下，民族独立运动和全世界各国人民争取和平的群众运动，已经汇合成一股不可抗拒的强大力量，正像百川殊途同归大海，波澜壮阔，汹涌澎湃，有力地捍卫着世界和平，使帝国主义的侵略扩张政策一再遭到失败。
    郭沫若在讲话中严厉谴责美帝国主义妄图实现它称霸全球的野心，一直顽固地阻挠国际局势的缓和；谴责美帝国主义在全世界人民所最关心的停止试验并且永久禁止使用核武器、裁减军备、撤退和取消在别国领土上的外国军队和军事基地等问题上，一再拒绝苏联所提出的积极倡议；谴责美帝国主义在世界各地进行的侵略阴谋和战争活动。郭沫若举出种种事实和第二次世界大战以来的历史，证明美帝国主义的扩张政策、侵略政策是新战争的根源，美帝国主义已经成为世界和平最凶恶的敌人，成为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民争取和维护民族独立运动的最凶恶的敌人。
    郭沫若说，但是，美帝国主义的战争威胁吓不倒争取和平的各国人民，它的欺骗和阴谋也正在为越来越多的人们所识破。今天美帝国主义尽管还在作疯狂的垂死挣扎，但是它绝对没有办法逃避走向灭亡的历史命运，它必然沿着捣乱、失败、再捣乱、再失败的道路走去，直到最后的灭亡。
    郭沫若满怀信心地说，在今天和平力量压倒战争势力的形势下，在全世界人民的面前正展开着一幅光辉灿烂的前景。只要全世界爱好和平的人民团结一致、坚持斗争，世界和平事业必将取得更大的胜利。
    郭沫若说，我们全国人民完全拥护我们政府的和平建设政策和和平外交政策。我们坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义的战争和侵略政策，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的正义斗争。我们热烈支持世界和平理事会关于裁减军备、禁止核武器和停止核武器试验、召开大国首脑会议、结束冷战、加强国际合作等有利于缓和国际局势、维护世界和平的建议。我们完全支持苏联关于签订对德和约、建立欧洲集体安全以及在远东和整个太平洋区域建立和平地区和无原子武器地区的建议。
    郭沫若最后说，我们全国人民正在以冲天的干劲从事着伟大祖国的和平建设，我们以这种全民的实际行动不断地加强着和平力量，保卫世界和平。中国人民深深懂得，只有我们祖国更加强大了，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加强大了，帝国主义才不敢来侵犯我们，才不敢冒险发动新的世界战争，世界和平才有更可靠的保证。中国人民将继续贡献出我们的一份力量，同全世界一切爱好和平的人民更加紧密地团结在一起，共同为争取世界的持久和平而奋斗到底！
    北京钢铁厂工人代表刘宝江、全国妇联副主席刘清扬、中国原子物理学家钱三强和作家老舍先后在会上讲了话。
    刘宝江说，曾经长期受到帝国主义压迫和侵略战争残害的中国工人阶级，过去是今后仍然是世界和平的忠实保卫者。他表示中国工人在中国共产党的领导下，要以更大的干劲、更高的智慧从事和平建设。
    刘清扬说，热爱和平的中国妇女正在同全国人民一起，鼓足干劲，为加速祖国社会主义建设，为使妇女儿童生活更加幸福美好，为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
    钱三强说，在科学事业有了突飞猛进的发展的今天，在人类已经掌握了原子能的时代，科学只有为和平服务、为劳动人民的幸福生活服务，科学本身才能有更广阔的发展。他表示中国科学工作者将坚持不懈地使科学技术为祖国的社会主义建设服务，为保卫世界和平贡献自己的力量。
    老舍说，爱自然、爱和平、爱人生是我国文艺的传统精神。我们珍爱这个传统，我们需要一个和平的环境。和全国人民一样，中国文艺工作者热爱和平、坚决反对帝国主义的侵略。
    在郭沫若等人的讲话当中，全场不断地发出热烈的掌声，这声音带着每一个人的善良的心愿，显示出了维护和平的坚强意志和必胜的信心。
