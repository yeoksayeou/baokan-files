Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: More than 1,200 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally this morning at the Capital Theater to warmly celebrate the brilliant victory of the World Peace Movement, on the eve of its tenth anniversary. They expressed that the 600 million Chinese people will, together with peace-loving people around the world, continue to hold high the banner of safeguarding peace and opposing aggression, and fight to the end for the realization of lasting world peace.

The Capital Theater was decorated solemnly and simply today. In the center of the rostrum was a peace dove flag and the inscription "1949-1959." Opposite it, a huge red banner read: "Long Live World Peace!" This symbolizes that since the World Peace Congresses held simultaneously in Paris and Prague in late April 1949, the cause of safeguarding world peace has been taken up by hundreds of millions of people, and the World Peace Movement has become an irresistible torrent.

Many well-known peace figures from home and abroad, representatives of workers in the capital, and representatives from all walks of life, including women, youth, science, and the arts, attended the meeting. Among them were Guo Moruo, Liao Chengzhi, Chen Shutong, Liu Ningyi, Mao Dun, Shao Lizi, Cai Tingkai, Liu Changsheng, Chu Tunan, Wu Han, Lao She, Qian Sanqiang, Xirao Gyatso, Hou Debang, Wu Yaozong, Liu Qingyang, Jin Zhonghua, Zhang Chao, Liu Baojiang, and Qu Tangliang.

Also invited to attend the meeting were prominent peace figures from various countries, including Andr√©son, Chairman of the Icelandic Peace Committee and member of the World Peace Council, and his wife; Kinkazu Saionji, a Japanese peace activist and Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee; Ko Bong Giu, a Korean peace activist; Eyre, Vice-Chairman of the New Zealand Peace Committee and member of the World Peace Council, and his wife; Freer, Vice-Chairman of the New Zealand Peace Committee, and his wife; the renowned African-American scholar and member of the World Peace Council, W.E.B. Du Bois; and Mrs. Du Bois.

The meeting was presided over by Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. In his opening remarks, he expressed full support for the World Peace Council for its unremitting efforts to ease international tensions, oppose war, and safeguard world peace, and wished the World Peace Movement further development.

Amidst warm applause, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, took the stage to speak.

In reviewing the development of the World Peace Movement over the past decade, Guo Moruo said that the World Peace Movement has become a broad mass movement encompassing people from all walks of life. Today, maintaining world peace has become the common aspiration of the vast number of workers, peasants, women, youth, intellectuals, and people of other strata in various countries around the world. In recent years, many new organizations and movements striving for peace have also emerged around the world. Whenever imperialism creates tensions and seriously threatens peace, the united and resolute struggle of people around the world, especially the unremitting efforts made by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union to safeguard peace, have repeatedly foiled the war and aggression plans of imperialism and defended world peace.

In his speech, Guo Moruo particularly mentioned the great efforts and contributions made by the World Peace Council in maintaining world peace, supporting the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for national independence, and in strengthening international cooperation and developing friendship and unity among the peoples of all countries. He expressed deep remembrance and respect for the outstanding peace fighter, Professor Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, who passed away last year.

Guo Moruo continued, "The current international situation is conducive to the struggle for world peace. Now, the East Wind has further prevailed over the West Wind, and the forces of peace have greatly surpassed the forces of war. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the most reliable force for defending world peace. It encourages the victorious confidence of people around the world in opposing aggression and defending peace. With the strong support of the socialist camp, the national independence movement and the mass movements of people in various countries around the world striving for peace have converged into an irresistible powerful force, like rivers flowing into the sea, magnificent and surging, vigorously defending world peace, and repeatedly thwarting the imperialist policy of aggression and expansion."

In his speech, Guo Moruo severely condemned U.S. imperialism's vain attempts to realize its ambition of dominating the world and its persistent obstruction of the easing of international tensions. He condemned U.S. imperialism for repeatedly rejecting the positive proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on issues of greatest concern to people around the world, such as the cessation of testing and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, disarmament, and the withdrawal and cancellation of foreign troops and military bases on the territory of other countries. He condemned U.S. imperialism for its aggressive conspiracies and war activities around the world. Guo Moruo cited various facts and the history since World War II to prove that U.S. imperialism's policy of expansion and aggression is the root cause of new wars, that U.S. imperialism has become the most vicious enemy of world peace, and the most vicious enemy of the national independence movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Guo Moruo said, "However, the war threats of U.S. imperialism cannot scare the people of all countries striving for peace, and its deceptions and conspiracies are being seen through by more and more people. Today, although U.S. imperialism is still making frantic death throes, it has absolutely no way to escape the historical destiny of heading towards extinction. It will inevitably follow the path of making trouble, failing, making trouble again, and failing again, until its final demise."

Guo Moruo said with full confidence, "In today's situation where the forces of peace outweigh the forces of war, a bright and splendid prospect is unfolding before the people of the world. As long as the peace-loving people of the world unite and persist in their struggle, the cause of world peace will surely achieve greater victories."

Guo Moruo said, "Our people fully support our government's peaceful construction policy and peaceful diplomatic policy. We resolutely oppose the policy of war and aggression pursued by imperialism headed by the United States, and we firmly support the just struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for national independence. We warmly support the World Peace Council's proposals on disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, the convening of a summit conference of major powers, the ending of the Cold War, and the strengthening of international cooperation, which are conducive to easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace. We fully support the Soviet Union's proposals on signing a peace treaty with Germany, establishing a European collective security system, and establishing peace zones and nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Far East and the entire Pacific region."

Guo Moruo concluded, "Our people are engaged in the peaceful construction of our great motherland with soaring enthusiasm. We are constantly strengthening the forces of peace and defending world peace through this practical action of the whole people. The Chinese people deeply understand that only when our motherland is stronger, and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is stronger, will imperialism not dare to invade us, not dare to risk launching a new world war, and will world peace have a more reliable guarantee. The Chinese people will continue to contribute our share of strength, unite more closely with all peace-loving people around the world, and fight to the end for lasting world peace!"

Liu Baojiang, a representative of workers from the Beijing Iron and Steel Plant, Liu Qingyang, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Qian Sanqiang, a Chinese atomic physicist, and Lao She, a writer, also spoke at the meeting.

Liu Baojiang said that the Chinese working class, which has long suffered from imperialist oppression and the ravages of wars of aggression, was and will remain a staunch defender of world peace. He expressed that the Chinese workers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will engage in peaceful construction with greater enthusiasm and higher wisdom.

Liu Qingyang said that peace-loving Chinese women are, together with the people of the whole country, going all out, aiming high, and striving to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland, to make the lives of women and children happier and better, and to defend world peace.

Qian Sanqiang said that in today's world, where scientific undertakings have made rapid progress, and in an era when mankind has mastered atomic energy, science can only have broader development if it serves peace and the happy lives of the working people. He expressed that Chinese scientific workers will unremittingly make science and technology serve the socialist construction of the motherland and contribute their strength to defending world peace.

Lao She said that loving nature, loving peace, and loving life are the traditional spirit of our country's literature and art. We cherish this tradition, and we need a peaceful environment. Like the people of the whole country, Chinese literary and art workers love peace and resolutely oppose imperialist aggression.

Throughout the speeches of Guo Moruo and others, the hall resounded with warm applause, carrying the kind wishes of everyone and demonstrating a strong will to maintain peace and a firm confidence in victory.
