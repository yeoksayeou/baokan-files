Comrade Representatives:

I fully agree with the government work report by Premier Zhou Enlai and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Railway transportation and railway construction are issues of great concern to the people of the whole country. I would like to share some opinions on this matter.

In 1958, China's industry and agriculture achieved an overall Great Leap Forward. Railway workers also did a lot of work in the Great Leap Forward. The freight volume completed was 380 million tons, an increase of 39 percent over 1957, ensuring the transportation of 10.7 million tons of steel and other important materials. More than 3,500 kilometers of new railways were laid, and 350 new locomotives were built, both more than double those of 1957. 11,000 new freight cars were built, an increase of 51 percent over 1957. These achievements are the result of the joint efforts of all railway workers and commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country.

Last year, railway transportation was very strained, especially in the fourth quarter, when coal transport volume surged, with a large amount of coal being transported from the north to the south, and the throughput capacity of railway trunk lines and the number of locomotives and vehicles were insufficient. This tense situation is a pressure on us railway workers, but also a driving force for us to move forward.

In 1959, China's national economic plan is a plan for continued Great Leap Forward. The plan stipulates that railway freight volume will be 520 million tons, 5,500 kilometers of railways will be built, and 555 new locomotives and 27,000 to 28,500 freight cars will be built. This task is very large, but we have the confidence to complete it. Judging from the current situation, transportation is still very strained, and the materials that need to be transported may be greater than the planned figures. We must also go all out to strive for over-fulfillment.

Now I will talk about how to complete this year's railway transportation task.

I. Take Coal Transportation as the Key Link and Make Overall Arrangements for Transportation

Since the fourth quarter of last year, we have learned an important lesson, that is, railway transportation should take coal transportation as the key link and make overall arrangements. The guiding principle of China's industrial construction is "taking steel as the key link and achieving an overall leap forward." Steelmaking requires a large amount of coal and iron, and the transportation of coal and iron mainly relies on railways. With coal, there is iron; with iron, there is steel. To ensure steel production, we must ensure coal transportation. This year, the volume of coal, iron, and materials related to coal and iron production accounts for about 60 percent of the total railway freight volume, and the volume of coal alone accounts for more than 40 percent of the total freight volume. Except for coal, the proportion of other ten important materials is not large, only mineral building materials such as bricks, tiles, sand, and stones account for about 10 percent. The rest, such as oil, ore, steel and its products, wood, cement, grain, cotton, metal industrial products, and daily-use industrial products, are all less than 10 percent, and some are even less than 1 percent. With good arrangement of coal transportation, the transportation of other materials will be easier. In the fourth quarter of last year, the arrangement of coal transportation was not good enough. It was transported wherever it was needed, disrupting the transportation plan and wasting some transportation capacity. Since February of this year, the arrangement of coal transportation has been better, and the transportation situation has been relatively stable. As a result, more coal has been transported, and more other materials have also been transported. "Taking coal transportation as the key link and making overall arrangements" is the concretization of the principle of "ensuring key points and taking care of the general" in railway transportation work, and it is also a relatively long-term transportation policy for China's railways.

II. Use Transportation Capacity Rationally

The scale and speed of China's socialist construction are unprecedented. From the perspective of future development, hundreds of thousands of kilometers of railways, tens of thousands of locomotives, and millions of freight cars are necessary. To achieve this goal, a large amount of steel is needed, and the large-scale development of the steel industry takes a certain amount of time. Therefore, the rational use of transportation capacity is particularly important.

The transportation industry is a material production sector. Generally speaking, production cannot be separated from transportation. According to the needs of production development, transportation equipment capacity should have sufficient reserves. However, transportation production is different from other industrial production. Meeting the necessary transportation needs of society, the less transportation production, the better. Because the product of the transportation industry—ton-kilometers—cannot be stored; it is consumed at the same time as it is produced. Under all the same conditions, the consumption of transportation capacity is directly proportional to the transportation distance. The longer the distance, the greater the consumption. Unnecessary long-distance transportation, repeated transportation, and counter-flow transportation are all wasteful consumption of the labor force and materials of the transportation industry and a waste of national wealth. For example, transporting coal from Northeast China to the Jiangnan region, the transportation distance is as long as more than 2,000 kilometers, which is five times longer than the average distance of coal transportation. Transporting eight trains of coal, the locomotive consumes about one train of coal.

To use transportation capacity rationally, we must mainly solve two problems: one is industrial layout, and the other is material allocation.

Industrial layout, especially the layout of the coal and iron industries, must fully consider transportation conditions. Railway construction should be based on factories and mines, and factory and mine construction should also be based on railways. Steel plants should be located as close as possible to coal mines and iron mines, which can save transportation capacity and reduce steel production costs. In coal and iron ore producing areas, if possible, steel plants should be set up. Railway vehicles can transport things in both directions, reducing vehicle empty running. Coal mines should increase washing and selection equipment, and coking raw coal should be washed and selected on the spot. Transporting refined coal can save one-third to one-half of the transportation capacity compared to transporting raw coal.

When allocating materials, we should consider reasonable flow direction, supply as close as possible, and fix the supply relationship to reduce long-distance transportation and counter-flow transportation. Recently, under the auspices of the State Economic Commission, the "Zoning Production and Sales Balance and Rational Flow Chart" for seven major materials including coal, oil, grain, wood, cement, ore, and salt has been formulated. Conscientiously implementing and developing this method will greatly save transportation capacity.

III. Accelerate Railway Construction to Ensure Coal and Iron Production

To develop the steel industry, it is impossible without railway transportation. Conversely, to accelerate railway construction, it is impossible without a large amount of steel. Railways are a large consumer of steel: building a locomotive requires 200 tons of steel, building a freight car requires 28 tons of steel, and building one kilometer of railway (including various fixed equipment) requires 200 tons of steel. Maintaining locomotives, vehicles, and lines also requires a lot of steel. Railway construction requires a large amount of steel, and the entire national economic construction requires even more steel. Therefore, not only must railway transportation first "ensure coal and iron," but railway construction must also be arranged according to this principle.

This year, the main focus of road construction is on building branch lines and dedicated lines for factories and mines, transforming existing railways, and secondly, on necessary trunk lines. Most of the branch lines and dedicated lines for factories and mines are to ensure coal and iron production. Trunk lines are also built in sections, first laying tracks to coal and iron bases. Most of the vehicles built are open cars, which are also to meet the needs of coal and iron transportation.

Railway construction should also take two legs forward, with both large foreign railways and small local railways being carried out simultaneously. Local railways are a new force, and their role should not be underestimated. Last year, about 400 kilometers of local railways were built in various places. This type of railway costs less money, is built quickly, and the materials are relatively easy to solve, and the technology is also easy to master. It should be actively developed. The Ministry of Railways is summarizing the experiences of various places, compiling technical standards, and drawing locomotive and vehicle drawings, which will be distributed to various places for reference. For the development of local railways, our railway departments have the responsibility to give active support.

IV. Strengthen Transportation Organization

To improve the railway's transportation capacity, on the one hand, we must accelerate capital construction and increase transportation equipment and locomotives and vehicles. On the other hand, we must strengthen transportation organization and fully tap the potential of existing equipment. This is effective without spending money or spending very little money. Potential is limited, but it is also unlimited. Under certain conditions, the potential of equipment is limited. How many pairs of trains can pass through a line, how much weight a locomotive can pull, and how much cargo a vehicle can load all have certain limits. We cannot subjectively want to increase them arbitrarily, exceeding objective possibilities. However, railway technical equipment is constantly innovating, the technical level of employees is constantly improving, and labor organization is constantly improving. In this sense, potential is unlimited. Therefore, we must tap potential every day and everywhere.

Last year, the level of railway transportation organization improved somewhat. In the Great Leap Forward, the masses put forward many practical slogans: "Trains do not stop, every second counts; goods do not stay, every ounce is not pressed," "Ask for cars from time, ask for efficiency from cooperation," and created some good experiences such as large-scale cooperation between railways, factories, and mines, and piggyback transportation (i.e., using heavy cars, return cars, guard cars, baggage cars, etc. that have gaps to carry goods). At the beginning of this year, these experiences were promoted, and transportation efficiency gradually increased. With little increase in transportation equipment, the average daily loading in March reached more than 34,800 cars, more than 2,000 cars more per day than in November, the month with the most loading last year. In April, it has stabilized at the level of 36,000 cars. Now it seems that further strengthening transportation organization can also use existing equipment to undertake more transportation tasks.

To strengthen transportation organization, we must strengthen transportation planning, strengthen daily transportation command, and accelerate the turnover of locomotives and vehicles. To complete more transportation tasks with limited locomotives and vehicles, we must emphasize the centralized and unified dispatch command and conscientiously implement the transportation discipline of "one unloading, two arranging, three loading." To ensure a large number of loadings and ensure the loading and transportation of major materials, we must seize the unloading and arranging of cars; slow unloading and slow arranging or less unloading and less arranging will immediately affect the loading of cars nationwide. Strengthening the large-scale cooperation between railways and factories and mines and supporting each other can further shorten the stay time of vehicles in factories and mines and improve the utilization efficiency of vehicles. At the same time, it is more conducive to ensuring the production of factories and mines. Fuxin Station and coal mine in Liaoning broke the boundary between road and mine, implemented the "ten unifications" of unified thinking, unified leadership, unified production, transportation, and sales, unified shifts, unified dispatch, and unified use of equipment, and jointly organized fast direct red flag trains. The vehicle stay time was shortened by half. Universally promoting this experience, the vehicle stay time of major factories and mines across the country can be shortened by another one-third from the current level. Implementing piggyback transportation can transport some light industrial raw materials and daily necessities without increasing vehicles. We plan to use piggyback transportation to transport 10 million tons of goods this year, equivalent to loading 800 more cars per day. Improving traffic order, improving punctuality rate, and ensuring traffic safety can all tap a lot of potential. Taking the above measures to compress the vehicle turnover time to less than 2.5 days, the existing locomotives and vehicles can load an average of three to four thousand more cars per day than in the fourth quarter of last year.

V. Launch a Mass Movement and Make a Big Technical Revolution

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, we have deeply realized that to complete railway transportation and railway construction tasks quickly, well, and economically, we must launch a mass movement and make a big technical revolution. After the masses are mobilized, they will inevitably study technology, improve and innovate technology to reduce physical labor and improve production efficiency. Last year, railway workers created piggyback transportation, local humps, high platforms and low cargo positions, simple turnouts, and a large number of semi-mechanized and mechanized equipment. These are all simple and easy to implement, cost very little money, and have significant results.

For example, the local hump has now been built in 100 places, improving the station's shunting efficiency by 30 to 60 percent. More than 1,500 high platforms and low cargo positions have been built, increasing loading and unloading efficiency by one to eight times, of which the landslide high platform increases efficiency by more than 20 times. This year, we will continue to promote and develop these experiences. At present, we are vigorously promoting semi-mechanization and mechanization in loading and unloading, road maintenance, construction, and other departments. In the past few months, its effect has been seen. For example, road maintenance work has always been regarded as rough and clumsy work on the railway. After promoting semi-mechanization and mechanization, production efficiency has been improved and labor intensity has been reduced. According to preliminary calculations, the existing 120,000 road maintenance workers can do the work of 150,000 people. In the past, there was not a single female road maintenance worker, but now there are more than 20,000. In the past, people with some culture were unwilling to be road maintenance workers, but now there are many middle school students. At present, the labor of road maintenance workers is not as heavy and tiring as in the past, and the level of cultural technology has been greatly improved.

Now, railway workers across the country are vigorously launching a comprehensive Great Leap Forward red flag competition movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. The specific slogans are: "Vehicle Dedication, Material Dedication, Technology Dedication Movement," "1-5-1, Million Tons, Safe and Punctual Movement" ("1-5-1" requires each railway bureau to compress the freight car turnover time to about one day, the station loading and unloading and other operating time to about five hours, and the vehicle transfer time to about one hour. "Million Tons" means that a locomotive produces an average of one million ton-kilometers per day), "Long (tunnel), Large (bridge), Heavy (key earthwork) Fast Construction Movement." Deeply carrying out this movement, giving full play to the wisdom of the masses, and promoting the achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution will provide a strong guarantee for completing the year's transportation, vehicle building, and road construction tasks.

The mass production movement is essentially a revolutionary movement in production, a revolution against nature. Without a spirit of hard work, you cannot make a revolution. Chairman Mao often reminds us: "Qi can be encouraged but not discouraged." In the mass movements since last year, we have deeply felt the importance of this sentence. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Great Leap Forward in railway transportation was achieved by the masses working hard. In February of this year, it happened to be the Spring Festival, and passenger transportation doubled compared with usual, and more than 4,000 freight cars were used. According to past practice, the number of loadings could not be increased. We analyzed the situation, informed the masses, encouraged them again, and strengthened internal and external cooperation. The average daily number of loadings in February increased by more than 2,000 cars compared with January. It continued to rise in March and April. It can be seen that with full energy, high spirits, and vigor, our cause will always be promising.

In the Great Leap Forward last year, railway workers had sufficient energy and great ambition. We put forward the goal of doubling efficiency and always wanted to leap up in one step, lacking specific indicators for step-by-step advancement. We accepted this experience and have formulated more practical leap forward indicators since February of this year, and transportation efficiency has gradually increased. Facts have proved that the Great Leap Forward must not only have strategic goals for a certain period, but also have specific indicators that are practical and feasible for each stage. Taking a step forward, consolidating a step, and advancing with a position can better achieve the overall leap forward goal.

Comrade Representatives! We deeply feel that the railway department has a very important responsibility in national economic construction. All our railway workers must, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, work hard, be good pioneers, and strive to over-fulfill the railway transportation task to ensure the victorious realization of the national economic plan.

专栏：

    怎样完成今年的铁路运输任务
    铁道部吕正操副部长的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    铁路运输和铁路建设，是全国人民十分关心的问题。我就这个问题讲些意见。
    一九五八年我国工农业全面大跃进，铁路职工在大跃进中也做了许多工作。货运量完成了三亿八千万吨，比一九五七年增长百分之三十九，保证了生产一千零七十万吨钢和其他重要物资的运输。新建铁路铺轨三千五百多公里，新造机车三百五十台，都比一九五七年增长一倍以上。新造货车一万一千辆，比一九五七年增长百分之五十一。这些成绩，是在党的领导和全国人民的支持下，全国铁路职工和铁道兵指战员共同努力的结果。
    去年铁路运输情况十分紧张，特别是第四季度，煤炭运量激增，大量北煤南运，铁路干线通过能力和机车车辆均感不足。这种紧张局面，对我们铁路工作者是个压力，同时也是推动我们前进的动力。
    一九五九年我国国民经济计划是一个继续大跃进的计划。计划规定，铁路货运量五亿二千万吨，修建铁路五千五百公里，新造机车五百五十五台、货车二万七千到二万八千五百辆。这个任务是很大的，但我们有信心完成。从现在情况来看，运输还是很紧张的，需要运输的物资，可能大于计划数字，我们也要全力以赴，争取超额完成。
    我现在讲一讲怎样完成今年的铁路运输任务。
    一、以煤运为纲，全面安排运输
    去年第四季度以来，我们摸到了一条重要的经验，就是铁路运输要以煤运为纲、全面安排。我国工业建设的方针是“以钢为纲、全面跃进”。炼钢要用大量的煤和铁，煤铁的运输主要靠铁路。有煤才有铁，有铁才有钢，要保证钢铁生产，就必须保证煤炭运输。今年在铁路总运量中，煤铁以及与煤铁生产有关物资的运量，约占百分之六十，而煤炭的运量就占总运量的百分之四十以上。除煤炭外，其它十种重要物资运量的比重都不大，只有砖、瓦、沙、石等矿物性建筑材料占百分之十左右，其余如石油、矿石、钢铁及其制品、木材、水泥、粮食、棉花、金属工业品、日用工业品，都在百分之十以下，有的还不到百分之一。把煤炭运输安排好了，其它物资的运输就比较好办些。去年第四季度，煤炭运输安排的不够好，哪里要就往哪里运，打乱了运输计划，浪费了一些运输力。今年二月以来煤炭运输安排得比较好些，运输局面就比较稳定，结果是多运了煤，也多运了其它物资。“以煤运为纲、全面安排”，是“保证重点，照顾一般”的方针在铁路运输工作中的具体化，也是我国铁路比较长期的运输政策。
    二、合理使用运输力
    我国社会主义建设规模之大，速度之快，是空前的。从发展前途看来，非有几十万公里铁路、几万台机车、成百万辆货车是不行的。要实现这个目标，就需要大量的钢铁，而钢铁工业的大发展，需要一定的时间。因此，合理地使用运输力，就显得特别重要。
    运输业是一个物质的生产部门。一般地说，进行生产是离不开运输的。根据生产发展的需要，运输设备能力应有充分的后备。但运输生产和其它工业生产不同，满足了社会必要的运输需要，运输生产越少越好。因为，运输业的产品——吨公里是不能储存的，它在生产的同时就消耗掉了。在一切情形相同时，运输力的消耗与运输距离成正比，距离越长，消耗越大。不必要的长距离运输、重复运输、对流运输，都是无谓地消耗运输工业的劳动力和资材，是对国家财富的浪费。例如，从东北运煤到江南，运输距离长达二千多公里，比煤炭运输的平均距离延长五倍；运八列车煤，机车就要消耗约一列车煤。
    合理使用运输力，主要要解决两个问题：一是工业布局，二是物资调拨。
    工业布局，特别是煤铁工业布局，必须充分考虑运输条件。铁路建设要就厂矿，厂矿建设也要就铁路。钢铁厂应该尽可能地靠近煤矿和铁矿，既可节省运输力，又可降低钢铁生产成本。在煤炭和铁矿石产地，如有可能，都设置钢铁厂，铁路车辆往返都有东西可运，减少车辆空驶。煤矿增加洗选设备，炼焦原煤在原地洗选，运精煤比运原煤可以节省三分之一到二分之一的运输力。
    调拨物资应该考虑合理的流向，尽可能地就近供应，并将供应关系固定下来，减少过远运输和对流运输。最近，在国家经委主持下，制定了煤炭、石油、粮食、木材、水泥、矿石、盐七种主要物资的“分区产销平衡合理流向图”，认真执行和发展这种办法，将大大地节省运输力。
    三、加速铁路建设保证煤铁生产
    要发展钢铁工业，离开铁路运输是不行的。反之，要加速铁路建设，没有大量的钢铁也是不行的。铁路是钢铁的大量消耗者：造一台机车需要钢铁二百吨，造一辆货车需要钢铁二十八吨，修一公里铁路（包括各种固定设备）需要钢铁二百吨，养护机车、车辆和线路也需要不少的钢铁。铁路建设需要大量的钢铁，整个国民经济建设更需要大量的钢铁。因此，不仅铁路运输必须首先“保煤保铁”，而且铁路建设也必须根据这个原则来安排。
    今年修路主要是修厂矿支线、专用线，改造现有铁路，其次是必要的干线。厂矿支线、专用线大部分是为了保证煤铁生产的。干线也是分段建设，先铺轨到煤、铁基地。造车大部分是敞车，这也是为了满足煤铁运输的需要。
    铁路建设也要两条腿走路，大洋铁路与小土铁路同时并举。土铁路是一支新生的力量，不能小看它的作用。去年各地已修建了土铁路约四百公里。这种铁路花钱少、建设快、材料比较容易解决，技术也容易掌握，应该积极发展。铁道部正在总结各地的经验，编拟技术标准和绘制机车、车辆图纸，将分发各地参考。对于土铁路的发展，我们铁路部门有责任给以积极的支持。
    四、加强运输组织工作
    提高铁路的运输能力，一方面靠加速基本建设，增加运输设备和机车车辆；另一方面，必须加强运输组织工作，充分挖掘现有设备的潜力，这是不花钱或者花钱很少就可以见效的。潜力是有限的，又是无限的。在一定的条件下，设备的潜力是有限的，一条线路能通过多少对列车，一台机车能拉多少重量，一辆车能装多少货物，都有一定的限度，不能凭主观愿望，超越客观的可能，随意增加。但是，铁路的技术设备在不断革新，职工的技术水平在不断提高，劳动组织在不断改进，从这种意义上说，潜力又是无限的。所以我们要天天挖潜力，处处挖潜力。
    去年铁路运输组织工作水平有所提高。群众在大跃进中，提出了许多有实际意义的战斗口号：“车不停驶，分秒必争；货不停留，斤两不压”，“向时间要车，向协作要效率”，创造了铁路、厂矿大协作，捎脚运输（既利用有空隙的重车、回空车、守车、行李车等捎带货物）等一些好经验。今年初，推广了这些经验，运输效率步步提高，在运输设备增加不多的情况下，三月份平均每日装车达到三万四千八百多车，比去年装车最多的十一月份每天多装二千多车。四月份已稳定在三万六千车的水平。现在看来，进一步加强运输组织工作，还可以用现有的设备，多担负一些运输任务。
    加强运输组织工作，必须加强运输计划性，加强日常运输指挥，加速机车车辆周转。要以有限的机车车辆完成更多的运输任务，必须强调调度指挥的集中统一，认真执行“一卸、二排、三装”的运输纪律。要保证大量的装车，保证装运主要物资，就要抓紧卸车和排车；缓卸缓排或少卸少排，就会立即影响全国的装车。加强铁路与厂矿的大协作，互相支援，可以进一步缩短车辆在厂矿的停留时间，提高车辆的利用效率，同时更有利于保证厂矿的生产。辽宁阜新车站和煤矿，打破了路矿的分界线，实行了统一思想、统一领导、统一产运销、统一班次、统一调度、统一运用设备等“十统一”的办法，共同组织快速直达红旗列车，车辆停留时间缩短了一半。普遍推广这个经验，全国主要厂矿的车辆停留时间，就可以从现有水平再缩短三分之一。推行捎脚运输，可以在不增加车辆的条件下，把一部分轻工业原料和生活必需品运走。我们打算今年利用捎脚运输运一千万吨货物，相当于每天多装八百车。改善行车秩序，提高正点率，保证行车安全，都可以挖掘不少潜力。采取以上这些办法，把车辆周转时间压缩到二点五天以下，以现有机车车辆就可以比去年第四季度每天平均多装三、四千车。
    五、大搞群众运动大闹技术革命去年大跃进以来，我们深切地体会到：要多快好省地完成铁路运输和铁路建设任务，就必须大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命。群众运动起来以后，必然会钻研技术、改进和革新技术，以减轻体力劳动，提高生产效率。去年，铁路职工创造了捎脚运输，土驼峰、高站台低货位、简易道岔和大量的半机械化机械化机具。这些，都是简单易行、花钱很少、效果显著的好办法。
    如土驼峰，目前已修建一百处，提高车站调车效率百分之三十到六十；高站台低货位已修建一千五百多座，提高装卸效率一倍至八倍，其中滑坡式高站台提高效率达到二十倍以上。今年，还要继续推广和发展这些经验。目前我们正在装卸、养路、施工等部门，大力推广半机械化和机械化。几个月来，已经看出它的效果。例如，养路工作在铁路上向来被看作是粗活、笨活，推广半机械化和机械化以后，提高了生产效率，减轻了劳动强度。根据初步计算，现有的十二万养路工，可以干十五万人的活。过去没有一个女养路工，现在已经有了二万多；过去有点文化的人不愿意当养路工，现在已有不少中学生。目前养路工的劳动已不像过去那样繁重劳累，文化技术水平大为提高。
    现在，全国铁路职工正在轰轰烈烈地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的全面跃进红旗竞赛运动，具体口号是：“献车、献料、献技术运动”，“1—5—1、百万吨、安全正点运动”（“1—5—1”是要求各铁路局把货车周转时间压缩到一天左右，车站装卸和其它作业时间压缩到五小时左右，车辆中转时间压缩到一小时左右。“百万吨”是一台机车平均一天生产一百万吨公里），“长（隧道）、大（桥）、重（重点土石方）快速施工运动”。深入地开展这个运动，充分发挥群众的智慧，推广技术革新和技术革命的成果，加速提高劳动生产率，对完成全年的运输、造车、修路任务，就有了有力的保证。
    群众生产运动，实质上就是生产中的革命运动，是革自然的命。没有一股干劲，就革不了命。毛主席经常提醒我们：“气可鼓不可泄”。我们在去年以来的群众运动中，深深感到这句话的重要性。去年第四季度，铁路运输的大跃进，就是群众鼓起干劲干起来的。今年二月，正逢春节，旅客运输比平时增加一倍，又占用了四千多辆货车，按历年惯例，装车数是上不去的。我们分析了情况，向群众交了底，再鼓干劲，加强内外协作，二月份平均每天装车数比一月份反而增加了二千多车。三、四月还在继续上升。可见鼓足干劲，意气风发，精神抖擞，我们的事业总是大有可为的。
    去年大跃进，铁路职工劲头很足，雄心很大，我们提出了效率翻一番的奋斗目标，总想一步跃上去，缺乏步步前进的具体指标。我们接受了这个经验，今年二月以来订出了比较切实的跃进指标，运输效率逐步上升。事实证明，大跃进既要有一定时期的战略目标，又要有每个阶段切实可行的具体指标。跃进一步，坚固一步，有阵地地前进，才能更好地实现总的跃进目标。
    各位代表！我们深深感到，铁道部门在国民经济建设中，责任十分重大。我们全体铁路职工，一定要在党的领导下，在全国人民的支持下，鼓足干劲，当好先行，力争超额完成铁路运输任务，保证国民经济计划的胜利实现。
