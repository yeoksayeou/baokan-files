    The Production Brigade is Active, the Commune is Even More Active
    (Our Dispatch) The Shihe People's Commune in Tongcheng, Anhui, according to the spirit of "unified leadership, decentralized management," has made the work of the production brigades more proactive than in the past. After the Wenchang Production Brigade directly managed the vegetable professional team, it immediately arranged a vegetable production plan, appointed a deputy brigade leader and an accountant to be specifically responsible for the management of the vegetable professional team, and allocated fertilizers and labor overnight, preparing to plant more than 50 kinds of vegetables to ensure the needs of commune members and the market supply. After the Qianjin Production Brigade directly managed the kiln, it immediately rectified the kiln, added and repaired 14 kinds of tools, and improved labor organization, increasing the efficiency of making brick blanks from more than 200 pieces per person per day to more than 500 pieces. Some small-scale sideline occupations have become more active after being directly managed by the production brigade.
    Because the role of the production brigade is fully utilized, the commune leadership is freed from bureaucratism, so it can better concentrate on grasping the key issues in production. Recently, the commune has concentrated its efforts on grasping the important link in the current production—rice seedling cultivation; studied and inspected the production plans of various production brigades, and deeply led the bumper harvest competition movement in the entire commune.
    The implementation of the method of "unified leadership, decentralized management" has also greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of cadres and the masses at all levels. Fang Shaohua, a member of the commune's Party committee, was sent to the Shengli Production Brigade, which had relatively poor performance, to serve as the secretary of the general branch, assisting the brigade in drawing up a production plan, striving to catch up with the advanced teams this year; and actively laboring with the commune members. Zhang Wensheng, the captain of the Fanshen Production Brigade, has made a plan to participate in labor production for 120 days this year. Cadres at all levels have generally planted experimental plots. The production enthusiasm of the commune members is also higher, and work efficiency has increased by more than 30%.
    Because the production brigades have thoroughly investigated their resources, they have further implemented the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily.
    A new spring production upsurge has formed in the Shihe People's Commune. Commune members are busy plowing the land to make seedling fields, accumulating fertilizer, and delivering fertilizer, making a big effort in spring plowing and production. By the 26th of last month, the entire commune had accumulated more than 53 million dan of fertilizer, made more than 1,800 mu of seedling fields, and sown more than 400,000 jin of rice seedlings.

### 大队主动，公社更主动

    大队主动，公社更主动
    本报讯　安徽桐城石河人民公社根据“统一领导，分级管理”的精神，使生产大队的工作比过去更主动了。这个公社的文昌大队直接管理了蔬菜专业队以后，立即安排了蔬菜生产计划，确定一个副大队长和一个会计专门负责管理蔬菜专业队，并连夜分配了肥料、劳力，准备种五十多种蔬菜，保证社员和供应市场的需要。前进大队直接管理了窑厂以后，立即对窑厂进行整顿，添制、整修了十四样工具，并且改进劳动组织，每人做砖坯的效率由每天二百多块提高到五百多块。有些小型副业由生产大队直接管理后，显得更加活跃。
    由于充分发挥生产大队的作用，使公社领导摆脱了事务主义，因此可以更好地集中精力抓生产上的关键问题。最近，公社就集中力量抓住了当前生产上的重要环节——育秧；研究和检查了各生产大队的生产计划，深入领导全公社的丰产竞赛运动。
    实行“统一领导，分级管理”的办法，还大大鼓舞了各级干部和群众的生产积极性。公社党委委员方绍华下放到工作较差的胜利大队担任总支书记，协助大队订出生产计划，力争今年赶上先进队；并和社员一道积极劳动。翻身大队大队长张文升已订出今年要参加劳动生产一百二十天的计划。各级干部已普遍种了试验田。社员生产积极性也更加高涨，工作效率提高30％以上。
    由于各生产大队摸清家底，进一步贯彻了勤俭办社的方针。
    石河人民公社一个新的春季生产高潮已经形成，社员们正在忙碌地翻地做秧田、积肥、送肥，大闹春耕生产。到上月26日止，全社已积肥五千三百多万担，做秧田一千八百多亩，育秧已播种四十多万斤。
