    Revising Plans According to Local Conditions
    (Our Dispatch) The Huohua People's Commune in Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, in implementing the system of unified leadership and decentralized management, has encouraged production brigades, within their authority, to mobilize commune members to meticulously discuss and revise their production plans based on their specific local conditions.
    In discussing the plan, the Fourth Production Brigade decided to appropriately match tall and short-stalked crops and implement intercropping and mixed cropping. Originally, the commune arranged for this team to allocate a certain amount of land specifically for growing cucumbers. Following the suggestion of the commune members, it was changed to intercropping cucumbers in the cornfields. This not only does not affect the yield of cucumbers, but also yields 300 jin of corn per mu. This team also mixed peanuts and corn, freeing up 100 mu of land to grow sweet potatoes in order to regulate consumption and solve the feed problem. By adopting methods of increasing planting and intercropping, this team can increase its income by more than 47,000 yuan in the spring season alone this year.
    In arranging production, the brigades conscientiously implemented the principle of combining self-sufficient production and commodity production, adapting to local conditions and making proper arrangements for some minor economic crops and local specialties. The Tenth Production Brigade is a well-known tobacco-producing area, but in recent years, tobacco production has been squeezed out by grain production. Now, this team has decided to allocate 100 mu of land to grow tobacco. In the past, minor products were often neglected, such as ginger, watermelon, medicinal materials, chili peppers, and other scattered vegetables. Now, the brigades are trying their best to plant them on river beaches, barren slopes, field ridges, and house corners without occupying arable land, in order to increase production and income in many ways.
    In order to promote the all-round leap forward of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, several production brigades near the Jialing River have organized fishing teams. Production brigades in hilly areas are planting a large number of fruit trees and developing animal husbandry.

    因地制宜修订计划
    本报讯　四川省南充县火花人民公社，在贯彻统一领导，分级管理制度中，各生产大队在自己职权之内，根据本身具体条件，发动社员细致讨论与修订队的生产计划。
    第四生产大队在讨论计划中，决定将高秆矮秆作物进行适当搭配，实行间种混作。原来公社安排这个队拨出一定土地专门种黄瓜。经社员建议，改在玉米地里间作黄瓜。这样既不影响黄瓜的产量，每亩还能收玉米三百斤。这个队还将花生、玉米进行混作，腾出一百亩地来种红薯，以便调剂食用和解决饲料问题。由于采用增种、间种的办法，这个队今年仅大春一季就可以增加收入四万七千多元。
    各大队在安排生产中，认真贯彻自给性生产和商品性生产相结合的方针，因地制宜，对一些小宗经济作物和土特产品，都进行了妥善安排。第十生产大队是著名的烟叶产地，但近几年来烟叶生产被粮食挤掉，现在这个队已决定划出一百亩土地种植烟叶。过去往往忽略的小宗产品，如生姜、西瓜、药材、辣椒及其他零星蔬菜等，现在各大队在不占用耕地的原则下，尽量利用河滩、荒坡、田坎、屋角来种植，从多方面来增加生产，增加收入。
    为促进农、林、牧、副、渔全面跃进，靠近嘉陵江的几个生产大队都组织了渔业队。丘陵区各大队大量种植果树和发展畜牧业。
