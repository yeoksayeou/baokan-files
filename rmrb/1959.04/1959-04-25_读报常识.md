	Yellow Sect, White Sect
	Yellow Sect and White Sect are two sects of Tibetan Buddhism.
	The Yellow Sect is currently the largest sect, founded by Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) in the early Ming Dynasty. Tsongkhapa's "Lamrim Chenmo" is the basic scripture of the current Yellow Sect. In the early Qing Dynasty, the Yellow Sect took control of the Tibetan local government, and its leaders were the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni. The monasteries are centered on the three major monasteries of Lhasa, namely Drepung, Sera, and Ganden, and the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse. Their affiliated monasteries are spread throughout the Tibetan areas of Sichuan, Qinghai, and Gansu, such as Gunggadelek, Reting Monastery, Qinghai Tar Monastery, and Gansu Labrang Monastery, all of which are larger monasteries. The Upper and Lower Tantric Colleges in Lhasa are the main academic institutions for the Yellow Sect to study Tantric Buddhism.
	The White Sect is the common name for the "Kagyu school". "Kagyu" means oral transmission. This sect was founded by Marpa (1012-1095) of the Song Dynasty. The Phagmo Drupa branch of the White Sect once inherited the Sakya school to control the entire Tibetan government. Many White Sect masters served as national preceptors of the Yuan Dynasty. The main monasteries include Drikung, Dralung, Tsel Gungtang, and Palpung Monastery. Kagyu monks wear white skirts, hence the common name White Sect.
	Names of Former Tibetan Local Administrative and Military Organizations

	Rebel Lhukangwa Tsering Dorje
	Lhukangwa Tsering Dorje was the former Acting Tibetan King, dismissed in 1952 for opposing the Seventeen-Point Agreement. He later lived in Kalimpong, India, directing Tibetan reactionaries in rebellion.
	Lhukangwa was at the forefront of opposing the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet signed in May 1951. When visiting our responsible comrades, he arrogantly slandered us for "invading the small country of Tibet."
	In 1952, Lhukangwa and others instigated the reactionary "People's Congress" to launch armed riots to oppose the implementation of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. At the firm request of Representative Zhang Jingwu, Lhukangwa was dismissed from his position as Sicao.
	In 1957, Lhukangwa betrayed the motherland and fled to Kalimpong, India. With the support and instigation of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, he organized a treasonous group to carry out sinful activities that harmed the motherland.
	After launching this Tibetan rebellion, Lhukangwa openly held a press conference in India, declaring: "Tibet abolished the seventeen-point agreement signed with China on March 12" and "formally declared complete independence." In addition, he organized a so-called "Tibetan delegation" of traitors to meet with Indian Prime Minister Nehru, asking Nehru to "help the Tibetans present their issue to the United Nations with the sponsorship of the Indian government."
	Rebel Tsijang Losang Yexhi
	Tsijang Losang Yexhi is the chief instigator of this Tibetan rebellion. He came from a Tibetan aristocratic family, had shares in the Himalun Company, and colluded with imperialists in India. In 1947, after the Regent Reting Rinpoche was murdered by the Datra reactionary group, he became a confidant of the imperialist lackey Regent Datra. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, he was appointed as the Dalai Lama's deputy scripture teacher in 1953. In 1954, he was elected as a representative from Tibet to the National People's Congress, and later served as a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. He used his position in the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet to carry out treasonous activities. In 1954, he blocked the Dalai Lama from coming to Beijing, saying: "Some people in the two senior organs of Tibet—the Kashag and the Yiktsang—are opposed to the Dalai Lama going to Beijing. If he insists on going, he will have to act like a clown, making everyone unhappy." This rebellion finally exposed his reactionary face completely.
	Rebel Surkhang Wangchen Gelek
	Surkhang Wangchen Gelek was one of the four traitorous Kalöns of the former Tibetan local government, serving as the chief Kalön. He came from a large Tibetan aristocratic family. His family and he himself had connections with British, American, and other imperialists. In 1941, he was sent to India to contact the British to purchase arms. After returning to Tibet, he was appointed Kalön with heavy bribes. In 1947, when Tibetan reactionaries murdered the anti-British Reting Rinpoche, Surkhang Wangchen Gelek and Lhalu led troops to Reting Monastery and personally arrested Reting.
	On October 19, 1950, our army liberated Qamdo, which was heavily guarded by the Tibetan army, and the Tibetan local government and upper-level reactionaries were greatly shaken. At this time, two proposals emerged within the Tibetan power factions: negotiation and fleeing. Surkhang Wangchen Gelek actively encouraged the Dalai Lama to flee to India. Surkhang Wangchen Gelek later took leave to go to India for medical treatment out of fear of punishment. In India, he made contact with imperialist secret agents. In May 1952, he returned to Tibet from India and colluded with pro-imperialist elements in Tibet to carry out conspiracies, actively seeking to consolidate and expand his political power. He visited the mainland in 1954. In December 1954, he was elected as a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In 1956, he made excuses not to attend the CPPCC meeting, but actively participated in conspiratorial activities. On March 10 this year, Surkhang Wangchen Gelek openly betrayed the motherland.

    鲁康娃·泽旺饶登是原代理西藏藏王，1952年因反对十七条协议而被撤职，后来就住在印度噶伦堡，指挥西藏反动分子进行叛乱。
    1951年5月和平解放西藏办法的协议签字，鲁康娃充当了反对这个协议的急先锋。他在拜访我们负责同志的时候，狂妄地诬蔑我们“侵略西藏小国”。
    1952年鲁康娃等指使反动的“人民会议”发动武装骚乱，反对实现和平解放西藏的协议。在张经武代表的坚决要求下，撤销了鲁康娃的司曹职务。
    1957年鲁康娃叛离祖国，逃往印度噶伦堡，在帝国主义和蒋介石集团的支持和指使下组织叛国集团，进行违害祖国的罪恶活动。
    鲁康娃在他发动这次西藏叛乱之后，曾公然在印度举行记者招待会，宣称：“西藏在3月12日废除了它同中国签订的十七点协定”，并且“正式宣布完全独立”。另外他还组织一个叛国分子的所谓“西藏代表团”去会见印度总理尼赫鲁，要求尼赫鲁“帮助西藏人在印度政府赞助下向联合国提出他们的问题”。
    叛匪赤江·罗桑益西
    赤江·罗桑益西是这次策动西藏叛乱事件的主谋分子。他出身于西藏贵族，在喜马伦公司有股金，曾去印度和帝国主义勾结。1947年，热振活佛被大札反动集团谋杀后，他成为帝国主义走狗大札摄政的亲信。西藏和平解放后，1953年被任为达赖副经师。1954年被选为西藏出席全国人民代表大会的代表，后任西藏自治区筹备委员会委员。他利用自己在西藏上层反动集团中的地位，进行着叛国活动，1954年，他曾经阻挡达赖来北京。说：“达赖要去北京，西藏的两个高级机关——噶厦和译仓内有人反对，硬要去就只有唱花脸的办法，弄得大家不愉快”。这次叛乱事件终于彻底暴露了他的反动面貌。
    叛匪索康·旺清格勒
    索康·旺清格勒是原西藏地方政府四个叛国的噶伦中间的一个，任首席噶伦。他出身于西藏大贵族。他的家庭和他本人同英、美等帝国主义有联系。1941年，他被派至印度与英国接洽购买军火，返藏后以重贿得任噶伦。1947年，西藏反动分子杀害反英的热振活佛，索康·旺清格勒和拉鲁曾率军赶往热振寺，亲自逮捕热振。
    1950年10月19日我军解放了藏军重兵把守的昌都，西藏地方政府和上层反动分子受到很大震动。这时西藏当权派内部出现了谈判和外逃两种主张。索康·旺清格勒曾积极鼓动达赖喇嘛逃往印度。索康·旺清格勒后来畏罪，以治病为名请假前往印度。在印度，他与帝国主义特务分子取得联系。1952年5月他从印度返回西藏，与西藏亲帝分子勾结一起，进行阴谋活动，积极设法巩固和扩大自己的政治力量。1954年曾来内地参观。1954年12月他被选为中国人民政治协商会议委员。1956年政协开会，他托故不参加，却积极参预阴谋活动。今年3月10日，索康·旺清格勒公开叛变祖国。
