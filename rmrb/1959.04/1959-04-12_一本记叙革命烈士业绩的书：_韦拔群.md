　　A Book Recording the Achievements of Revolutionary Martyrs: "Wei Baqun"
　　Du Ying

    The book "Wei Baqun" (written by Xie Fumin), published by the Workers' Publishing House, is a good book recording the heroic deeds of Comrade Wei Baqun, a Zhuang revolutionary martyr.

    Comrade Wei Baqun was an early leader of the peasant movement in the Youjiang area of Guangxi, and one of the organizers and leaders of the Youjiang Soviet regime and the Red Seventh Army. He dedicated his life to the liberation of the working people and was a loyal son loved by the Zhuang people. He was from Donglitun, Donglan County, Guangxi, a mixed ethnic area. Before the victory of the people's revolution, the Zhuang, Han, and Yao people there lived in extreme poverty under the cruel exploitation of the landlord class. In addition to paying land rent, farmers had to perform corvée labor for the landlords, sending chickens and meat to the landlords during festivals, bamboo shoots and wood ear in the spring, and repairing houses and granaries for the landlords in the autumn. Tenant farmers were actually the landlords' serfs.

    Comrade Wei Baqun was born into a wealthy family, but he hated the system of people oppressing people. When he accepted the truth of Marxism-Leninism and joined the Communist Party, he first liberated the Yao serfs in his own family, distributing land to them for cultivation and giving them freedom.

    When he saw that even in remote and poor places like Donglan County, people were using French currency under the aggression of French imperialism, he deeply felt that if the national system was not reformed, the people would inevitably be in dire straits. Therefore, when Cai E organized the "National Protection Army" and sent a telegram to denounce Yuan Shikai, Comrade Baqun sold his land and purchased guns and ammunition, recruiting more than a hundred people in his hometown to go to Guiyang, determined to fight to protect the Republic. These early activities of Comrade Wei Baqun were spontaneous until he approached the Communist Party and found the correct direction.

    Comrade Wei Baqun was a hero of the Zhuang people, an outstanding member of the Communist Party, and his body radiated the lofty light of communism. When the Red Seventh Army went north to carry out new tasks in 1930, he stayed in Youjiang to persist in the struggle. At that time, the Xishan base area had already been under the enemy's frenzied attack, and Comrade Baqun always shared the same fate with the masses, never leaving Xishan. In the most difficult days, without food or shelter, sleeping in the mountains and drilling into caves, he stuck to his post and never retreated a step until his final sacrifice.

    The author of this book was a comrade-in-arms of Comrade Wei Baqun during his lifetime. He used sincere feelings and simple writing to record these moving stories, leaving a deep impression on the reader.

　　一本记叙革命烈士业绩的书：“韦拔群”
　　杜映
    工人出版社出版的“韦拔群”（谢扶民编写），是记述僮族革命烈士韦拔群同志英雄事迹的一本好书。
    韦拔群同志是广西右江早期农民运动领袖，是右江苏维埃政权和红七军的组织者和领导者之一。他一生献身于劳动人民的解放事业，是僮族人民爱戴的忠诚子弟。他是广西东兰县东里屯人，那里是个民族杂居区域，在人民革命胜利以前，当地的僮、汉、瑶各族人民，在地主阶级的残酷剥削下，过着极端贫困的生活。农民除了缴纳地租，还得给地主服劳役，逢年过节给地主送鸡送肉，春天送竹笋、木耳，秋天给地主修房屋、谷仓，佃户们实际是地主的农奴。
    韦拔群同志出身于一个富有的家庭，但他痛恨那种人压迫人的制度，当他一接受马列主义真理，参加共产党后，首先解放了他自己家中的瑶族农奴，分田给他们种，还给他们自由。
    当他看到在法帝国主义的侵略下，连东兰县那样的穷乡僻壤，人民也使用法元，深深感到国家制度如不改革，人民就难免处于水深火热之中。所以，当蔡锷组织“护国军”通电讨伐袁世凯的时候，拔群同志便变卖田产、购置枪械，在家乡召募了一百多人赶往贵阳，决心为保卫共和而战。韦拔群同志早期的这些活动，是自发性的，直到他接近了中国共产党，才找到了正确的方向。
    韦拔群同志是僮族人民的英雄，共产党的优秀党员，在他的身上，焕发着崇高的共产主义光辉。1930年红七军北上执行新的任务时，他留在右江坚持斗争。那时西山根据地已经受到敌人疯狂进攻，拔群同志始终和群众同生死、共患难，没有离开西山一步。在最艰难的日子里，没有吃的，没有住处，睡山林，钻石洞，可是他坚守着自己的岗位，没有退后一步，直到最后牺牲。
    这本书的作者，是韦拔群同志生前的战友。他用真挚的感情、朴素的文笔，记下了这些可歌可泣的故事，给读者留下了深刻的印象。
