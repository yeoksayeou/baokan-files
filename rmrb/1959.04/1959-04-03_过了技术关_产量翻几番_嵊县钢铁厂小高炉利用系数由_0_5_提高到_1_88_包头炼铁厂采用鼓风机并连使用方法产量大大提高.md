Hangzhou, April 2nd. A 3-cubic-meter blast furnace at the Shengxian Steel Plant in Zhejiang Province is producing an average of 5.64 tons of pig iron per day, with the utilization coefficient increasing from 0.5 to 1.88. The quality meets national standards, and the average coke ratio is 1.22. In recent days, this furnace has also set a high-yield record of more than 10 tons per day.

Constantly establishing the idea of high yield and high quality and continuously improving operating techniques are the key to the high yield of this blast furnace. This blast furnace went into operation very smoothly, producing more than 1,400 jin of iron on the first day; and the daily output reached more than 3 tons on the third day. At this time, they became complacent. Soon, news came that a similar furnace in Ningbo City was producing 4 tons of iron per day, which greatly shocked the workers. At this time, the Party branch of the plant immediately convened a meeting to further increase production. The meeting studied many technical issues and decided to increase the yield by increasing the wind pressure and increasing the wind temperature. After adopting this method, the furnace's appetite became bigger and bigger, and more and more molten iron flowed out. After a few days, the daily output reached 7.24 tons. One furnace produced 1,141 jin of molten iron. At this time, furnace chief Zhao Guichao used this number to calculate detailed accounts with the workers. If 16 furnaces were produced a day, and each furnace reached 1,141 jin, the daily output would be more than 9 tons. So everyone summarized the experience and believed that to achieve high yield, it is necessary to strictly implement operating procedures; secondly, the burden distribution must be uniform; and thirdly, the temperature must be adjusted frequently (especially in the second half of the night when the temperature drops, affecting the furnace temperature, attention should be paid to adjustment). After further improvements in operation, the daily output of this blast furnace quickly jumped to 8.227 tons, reaching a maximum of more than 10 tons.

The experience of Shengxian Steel Plant proves that to increase the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, in addition to continuously improving the technical level of workers, it is also necessary to formulate unified operating procedures and establish a normal production order. That is, according to the specific situation, summarize a series of advanced operating methods, summarize them into articles, mobilize the masses for full discussion, and then modify and supplement them, and hand them over to everyone for strict implementation.

Hohhot, April 2nd. The experience of the local state-owned Baotou Iron and Steel Plant in improving the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces to 1.3 by using blowers in parallel will be widely promoted in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

The air volume per cubic meter of volume of the small blast furnaces built in various places last year was only about 4 cubic meters according to the design. Due to insufficient air volume, the furnace temperature was affected, and the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces was only about 0.5, and the quality of pig iron was also very low. The method of using blowers in parallel adopted by the Baotou Iron and Steel Plant is to connect the blowers of two small blast furnaces with the same volume to one blast furnace, or to downgrade the blowers according to the design, so that the air volume per cubic meter of volume of the small blast furnace reaches 5 to 8 cubic meters. Experience has proved that using the blowers on two small blast furnaces with the same volume in parallel on one furnace greatly improves the smelting intensity of the small blast furnace, the hearth is sufficiently hot, and more iron is produced than the original two furnaces. The average utilization coefficient is stable above 1, and the quality of iron is excellent. The sulfur and phosphorus content also meet national requirements.

    过了技术关　产量翻几番
    嵊县钢铁厂小高炉利用系数由0.5提高到1.88
    包头炼铁厂采用鼓风机并连使用方法产量大大提高
    本报杭州2日电　浙江省嵊县钢铁厂一只三立方公尺的高炉，平均日产生铁五点六四吨，利用系数由零点五提高到一点八八，质量符合国家标准，平均焦比为一点二二。在这些日子里，这只炉子还创造了日产十吨多的高产纪录。
    不断树立高产优质思想，不断改进操作技术，是这只高炉高产的重要关键。这只高炉一开炉就很顺当，第一天出铁一千四百多斤；而第三天的日产量就达到三吨多。这时，他们就自满起来。不久，宁波市有一只同等的炉子日产四吨铁，消息传来，给工人们震动很大。这时，厂里的党支部即召开了进一步提高产量的会议，会上研究了许多技术问题，并决定用提高风压加大风温的办法来使产量突上去。采取这个办法后，只见炉子的胃口愈来愈大，铁水愈流愈多，几天之后，日产量达到七点二四吨。其中有一炉出了一千一百四十一斤铁水。这时炉长赵桂朝就用这个数字和工人一起算细账。一天出十六炉，如果炉炉达到一千一百四十一斤的话，日产量就在九吨以上。于是大家就总结了一下经验，认为要高产首先要严格执行操作规程；其次是布料均匀；第三是时常调节温度，（尤其是下半夜气温下降，影响炉温，要注意调节）。在操作上经过进一步的改进，这个高炉的日产量很快跃进到八点二二七吨，最高达到十吨多。
    嵊县钢铁厂的经验证明，要提高高炉利用系数，除不断提高工人的技术水平外还要制订统一的操作规程，建立正常的生产秩序。这就是根据具体情况，总结出一系列的先进操作方法，把它们归纳成条文，发动群众充分讨论，然后修改补充，交给大家严格执行。
    本报呼和浩特2日电　地方国营包头炼铁厂采用鼓风机并连使用的方法，把小高炉的利用系数提高到一点三的经验，将在内蒙古自治区普遍推广。
    各地去年建成的小高炉，每一立方公尺容积的鼓风量，按照设计，仅四立方公尺左右。由于风量不足，影响了炉内温度，小高炉利用系数平均只达零点五左右，生铁质量也很低。包头炼铁厂采用的鼓风机并连使用，是把容积相同的两个小高炉的鼓风机并到一个高炉上，或按照设计把鼓风机降级使用，使小高炉每一立方公尺容积的鼓风量达到五至八立方公尺。经验证明，把两座容积相同的小高炉上的鼓风机并连到一个炉子上使用，大大地提高了小高炉的冶炼强度，炉缸内热度充足，比原来两个炉子出铁还多，平均利用系数稳定在一以上，而且铁的质量优良，含硫、含磷量，也都符合国家要求。
