A Rival Show
By Our Correspondent Pan Fei
　　
On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, U.S. General Norstad gave an interview to a reporter from British Independent Television. Coincidentally, British Marshal Montgomery also published an article in the "Sunday Times" entitled: "The Past, Present and Future of the North Atlantic Alliance."
　　
Norstad is the "Supreme Allied Commander" of the North Atlantic Group. An American overlord stationed in Western Europe. Montgomery is hailed as a "distinguished British strategist" and served as the Deputy Commander of the North Atlantic Allied Forces for several years; he is an important figure in the British ruling group. As the saying goes, "Great minds think alike," but these two big shots hold diametrically opposed views on almost every issue concerning the North Atlantic Group, with differences as vast as one hundred and eight thousand li.
　　
The following are excerpts of their views on several major issues:
　　
(1) Who is the "creator" of the North Atlantic Group? Norstad and Montgomery gave different answers. Norstad, of course, believes that the United States is the creator of the North Atlantic Group, but he said: "—U.S.-British relations are very important. It is one of the strong cornerstones of the establishment of the North Atlantic Group." The implication is that the United States, with the cooperation of Britain, laid the foundation for the North Atlantic Group.
　　
Montgomery bluntly stated that Britain and Canada are the creators of the North Atlantic Group. He wrote: "First, in a speech at Fulton, Missouri, in March 1946, Sir Winston Churchill proposed the establishment of a defense alliance by peace-loving nations. At the time, this proposal was somewhat unpopular. However, in September 1947, the then Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs, St. Laurent, raised the matter again, expressing concern in a speech at the UN General Assembly about the Security Council's complete inability to guarantee the security of the free world in defense. In that speech, St. Laurent also said that countries should seek security for themselves by participating in a national alliance, and that countries participating in this national alliance should always bear special obligations for greater security.
　　
"It soon proved that he was right."
　　
"It was the great Ernest Bevin who drafted a plan to establish an alliance in Western Europe, which should be supported by the United States and the British Dominions. This plan led to the signing of the Brussels Treaty by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and Britain on March 17, 1948, thereby establishing the Western European Union.
　　
"The next action was taken by St. Laurent. On April 28, 1948, he publicly proposed in the Canadian House of Commons the establishment of a single mutual defense system that would include and replace the Brussels Treaty system, and also allow the United States, Canada, and certain other countries to participate, so that the Atlantic could provide security for Europe. The result of this proposal was the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
　　
In narrating the history of the North Atlantic Group, Montgomery, from the standpoint of the British Empire, lauded the notorious "Fulton Speech" and Bevin's Cold War activities. As for the United States, in Montgomery's view, it was merely following the lead of Britain and Canada.
　　
(2) Regarding the current situation of the North Atlantic Group, one expresses satisfaction, while the other is full of complaints.
　　
Norstad believes that the North Atlantic Group has been "contributing" in the past ten years; and in the next five or ten years, he will make the North Atlantic Group make greater "contributions." Needless to say, Norstad is trying to maintain the dominant position of the United States in the North Atlantic Group.
　　
Montgomery, however, demands a change in the status quo. He said: "What is the situation of the North Atlantic Alliance today? It now needs a thorough inspection and a comprehensive review of its political and military structure to adapt to the changed situation. There is now a huge waste of money and effort, and there is also a lot of unnecessary duplication." Montgomery then pointed out the contradictions between the member states of the North Atlantic Group and criticized the U.S. leadership. He said: "There is not even a common policy within the North Atlantic Alliance. Without a common policy, how can there be a common defense? Recently, we have read two opposing statements. One statement was made by the President of the United States, who said that Europe does not need to add ground troops now. The other was made by the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, who said that he needs more troops!"
　　
(3) Regarding France's refusal to hand over command of the Mediterranean fleet, they made completely opposite comments. Norstad said: "Naturally, in principle, this action is a worrying thing. Frankly, I must admit that I am worried about this statement of intent."
　　
Montgomery expressed sympathy and support for France's actions. He said: "Recently, France announced that its Mediterranean fleet would be withdrawn from the command of the North Atlantic Alliance and would be controlled by its own country in wartime. This action seems to have caused a great uproar. General de Gaulle has probably been studying the naval command structure in the Mediterranean, and he can't make head or tail of it. I am also puzzled! The entire command structure of the North Atlantic Alliance really needs to be revised. If we engage in war with the current command structure, the consequences will be disastrous."
　　
(4) Norstad demanded that the Western European "allies" hand over more troops to his command. Norstad hopes that in a year or a year and a half, the North Atlantic Group's troops can reach a little more than twenty-eight divisions. He urged the Western European countries to speed up the pace of expansion: "I hope to have this number of troops now. I hope we can accelerate the implementation of this plan, and of course I hope that this plan is already underway, and that the plan currently underway will be implemented by various countries as soon as possible."
　　
Montgomery not only did not mention accelerating the expansion of troops at all, but also demanded that member states have more flexibility. He said: "It is time for the North Atlantic Alliance authorities to understand that completely merging the troops of various countries into a single North Atlantic Alliance force is not the way. The troops needed in the North Atlantic Alliance are like this: commanded by their own countries, collectively balanced, and combined into a fighting machine with the closest cooperation. The key word is 'cooperation', not 'merger'."
　　
(5) Norstad firmly opposes the plan to establish a "security zone" in Central Europe, and firmly opposes Macmillan's so-called "troop reduction" plan. He said that his answer to establishing "disengagement" is: "Simply put, no, definitely no." His evaluation of the "troop reduction" plan is: it will weaken the "Western countries."
　　
Montgomery said: "We need to take a much more flexible attitude when dealing with these issues. For example, how long can North Atlantic Alliance countries continue to station troops on the territory of others? Why not let the troops of all countries return to their own countries? Of course, this cannot be implemented now, at least not until the European security issue is resolved. But at least we can start discussing this issue, conduct negotiations, and both sides can start reducing in batches in certain geographical areas to show sincerity."
　　
(6) Norstad believes that the purpose of establishing the North Atlantic Group is to "defend" Europe. And the meaning of "defending" Europe "is to defend Germany (referring to West Germany)." Montgomery, on the other hand, believes that the United States often uses various high-sounding names to undermine the British Empire. He said: "Unfortunately, we always have to plug colonial loopholes, such as Kenya, Malta, Cyprus, and now Central Africa. This prevents us from focusing on the ball; and, no matter how unreasonable it is, it gives those Americans who take a 'holier than thou' anti-colonialist attitude an opportunity to take advantage of."

    一场对台戏
    本报记者　潘非
    在北大西洋公约组织成立十周年的前夕，美国将军诺斯塔德向英国独立电视台的记者发表了谈话。无独有偶，英国元帅蒙哥马利，也在“星期日泰晤士报”上发表了一篇文章，题目是：“北大西洋联盟的过去、现在和将来”。
    诺斯塔德是北大西洋集团的“盟军最高总司令”。美国派驻在西欧的太上皇。蒙哥马利被捧为“英国杰出的战略家”，当了好几年北大西洋盟军副司令；他是英国统治集团中的重要人物。俗语说：“英雄所见略同”，但是这两个大头目，几乎在有关北大西洋集团的每一个问题上，都是针锋相对，持有截然相反的意见，相距十万八千里。
    下面摘录了他们对于几个主要问题的看法：
      （一）谁是北大西洋集团的“缔造者”？诺斯塔德和蒙哥马利给了不同的答案。诺斯塔德当然认为美国是北大西洋集团的缔造者，不过他说：“——美英关系是非常重要的。它是北大西洋集团建立时的坚强基石之一。”言外之意，是美国在英国的合作下，奠定了北大西洋集团的基础。
    蒙哥马利毫不客气地说，英国和加拿大是北大西洋集团的缔造者。他写道：“首先是1946年3月温斯敦·丘吉尔爵士在密苏里州富尔顿的一次演说里，提出了由爱好和平的国家建立一个防御联盟。当时，这个建议有点不受欢迎。可是1947年9月，当时加拿大的外交部长圣劳伦又提起了这件事，他在联大的一次演说里对安全理事会全然无力保证自由世界在防御上的安全表示关切。在那次演说里，圣劳伦还说，各国应该用参加一个国家联盟的办法来为自己寻找安全，参加这个国家联盟的各国永远应当为更大的安全承担特殊的义务。
    “不久以后就证明了他的话是正确的。”
    “是伟大的恩斯特·贝文拟定了一个在西欧建立一个联盟的计划，这个联盟应该得到美国以及不列颠各自治领的支持。这项计划导致了1948年3月17日比、荷、卢、法、英五国布鲁塞尔条约的签订，从而建立了西欧联盟。
  “下一个行动是圣劳伦采取的。1948年4月28日，他在加拿大众议院公开提出建立一个单一的互助防御体系，这个防御体系将包括并代替布鲁塞尔条约体系，并且让美、加以及某些其他国家也参加，为的是大西洋可以使欧洲得到安全。这个建议的结果是北大西洋公约组织的建立。”
    在叙述北大西洋集团的历史时，蒙哥马利从大英帝国的立场出发，对臭名昭著的“富尔敦演说”和贝文的冷战活动，予以大吹特吹。至于美国，在蒙哥马利看来，只不过是追随着英国和加拿大的倡导而已。
    （二）对于北大西洋集团的现状，一个表示满意，一个满腹牢骚。
    诺斯塔德认为在过去十年中，北大西洋集团是“有贡献”的；而在今后的五年或十年中，他将使北大西洋集团作出更大的“贡献”。用不着多说，诺斯塔德力图保持美国在北大西洋集团中主宰一切的地位。
    蒙哥马利却要求改变现状。他说：“今天北大西洋联盟的情况如何呢？它现在需要来一次彻底的检查和全面地检讨它的政治和军事结构，以适应已变化了的情况。现在在金钱和努力方面存在着巨大的浪费，而且还有大量的不必要的重复。”蒙哥马利接着指出北大西洋集团各成员国之间的矛盾，并且批评了美国的领导集团。他说：“北大西洋联盟内部甚至没有一项共同的政策。没有共同政策，如何能有共同防御？最近，我们读到了两种对立的言论。一种言论是美国总统发表的，他说现在欧洲不需要增添地面部队了。另一种是欧洲盟军最高司令发表的，他说他需要更多的陆军！”
      （三）关于法国拒绝交出地中海舰队的指挥权一事，他们作了完全相反的评论。诺斯塔德说：“自然，原则上讲来这个行动是一件令人担心的事情。坦白地说，我必须承认我对这项意图的声明感到担心。”
    蒙哥马利对法国的行动表示同情和支持。他说：“新近，法国通知说，它的地中海舰队将从北大西洋联盟指挥下撤回，在战时将归本国控制。这个行动似乎引起了轩然大波。戴高乐将军大概一直在研究地中海的海军指挥结构，而一点也摸不着其头脑。我也是莫名其妙！北大西洋联盟的整个指挥结构确实需要修正。如果我们以目前的指挥结构从事战争，其结果将不堪设想。”
      （四）诺斯塔德要求西欧“盟国”交出更多的军队，置于他的统帅之下。诺斯塔德希望在一年或一年半以后，北大西洋集团的军队可以达到二十八师多一点。他催促着西欧国家加快扩军的速度：“我希望现在就能有这个数目的军队。我希望我们能够加速这项计划的实现，而且当然希望现在这项计划已在进行，目前正在进行的这项计划，将会尽快地由各国加以实现。”
    蒙哥马利不仅根本没有提到要加速扩军，而且要求成员国有更多的机动权。他说：“是时候了，北大西洋联盟当局应该明白把各国的部队完全合并成一支北大西洋联盟部队不是办法。北大西洋联盟中所需要的部队是这样：由各国自己统率，集体地加以平衡，以最紧密的合作结合成一架作战机器。关键的字眼是‘合作’，而不是‘合并’。”
      （五）诺斯塔德坚决反对在中欧建立“安全区”的计划，坚决反对麦克米伦的所谓“减少军队”计划。他说，他对于建立“脱离接触”的回答是：“简单地说，不，肯定地说不。”他对于“减少军队”计划的评价是：它将削弱“西方国家”。
    蒙哥马利说：“我们在对待这些问题时，需要采取更加灵活得多的态度。比方说，北大西洋联盟国家把军队驻扎在他人的国土上能继续多久？为什么不让所有国家的军队都回到他们自己的国家去呢？当然这现在还不能实行，无论如何在欧洲安全问题解决以前不能实行。但是至少我们可以开始讨论这个问题，进行谈判，并且双方都开始在某些地理区域逐批减少，以示诚意。”
      （六）诺斯塔德认为，建立北大西洋集团的目的，是为了“保卫”欧洲。而“保卫”欧洲的涵义，“就是保卫德国（指西德）”。而蒙哥马利则认为美国经常假借着各种官冕堂皇的名义，来挖大英帝国的墙脚。他说：“不幸的是，我们总是必须堵塞殖民漏洞，例如怯尼亚、马耳他、塞浦路斯和现在的中非。这一点使我们的目光不能集中在球上；而且，不管是多么的没有道理，它给那些采取‘比你圣洁’的反殖民主义态度的美国人以可乘之机。”（附图片）
