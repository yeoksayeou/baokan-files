    Six Hundred Million Hearts Filled with Joy; Confidence Multiplied to March Towards New Victories
    The Whole Nation Cheers the Election of New National Leaders
    The people of the whole country warmly support the decision of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and support Chairman Mao's positive suggestion that he not serve as the Chairman of the State. Everyone deeply understands that: Comrade Mao Zedong devoting himself to serving as the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Party will enable him to concentrate more energy on dealing with the Party and the country's principles, policies, and lines, and free up more time to engage in the theoretical work of Marxism-Leninism, and this will not hinder him from continuing to play a leading role in the work of the country. This is more beneficial for the whole Party and the people of the whole country.
    Beijing

Last December, citizens had fully discussed the issue of Chairman Mao Zedong himself proposing that he no longer be a candidate for Chairman of the People's Republic of China. After patient explanations by Party organizations in various units, when they understood that Chairman Mao not serving as Chairman of the State, but devoting himself to serving as Chairman of the Central Committee of the Party, would enable him to concentrate more energy on dealing with the Party and the country's principles, policies, and lines, and that it might also give him more time to engage in the theoretical work of Marxism-Leninism, and that this would not hinder him from continuing to exert his wise leadership over the work of the country, the vast majority of people realized that doing so would be more beneficial for the country, for the people of the whole country, and for the Party, and therefore approved of this positive suggestion and warmly supported the decision of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC on this issue.

    全国欢呼选出新的国家领导人
    全国人民热烈拥护党的八届六中全会的决定，拥护毛主席提出的关于他不做国家主席的积极建议。大家深切认识到：毛泽东同志专做党中央主席，更能够集中精力来处理党和国家的方针、政策、路线的问题，腾出较多的时间从事马克思列宁主义的理论工作，而并不妨碍他对于国家工作继续发挥领导作用。这样，对于全党和全国人民都更为有利。
    北京
