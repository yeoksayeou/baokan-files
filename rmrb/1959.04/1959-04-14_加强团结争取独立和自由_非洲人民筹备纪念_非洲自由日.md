The statement said that these groups will publicize their opposition to the Union of South Africa's apartheid laws, oppose university segregation laws, and demand that all workers, regardless of race, receive the same wages.

According to plans, during "Africa Week," indoor gatherings will be organized in various parts of the Union of South Africa, demonstrations with placards will be held, and pamphlets and commemorative badges will be distributed. "Africa Week" will conclude on April 19th with a mass parade and rally in Alexandra Township.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 11th dispatch: Lagos dispatch: The Nigerian "West African Pilot" newspaper published an editorial yesterday stating that "Africa Freedom Day" is a reminder that "Africa is an indivisible whole, and it is the duty of every African to concentrate all resources to liberate the African motherland."

"Africa Freedom Day," which will be commemorated on April 15th, was initiated by the Conference of Independent African States held in Accra in April last year.

The "West African Pilot" said that the Conference of Independent African States had made its purpose for initiating "Africa Freedom Day" very clear. The awakening African giant should safeguard its legitimate rights, decide its own destiny, and live freely.
