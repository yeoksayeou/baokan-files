Lüda Industry Leaps Towards a New High Tide
Speech by Representative Hu Ming

I fully endorse Premier Zhou’s report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Comrade Peng Zhen’s report. Now, I will give a speech on the industrial situation in Lüda City.

In 1958, Lüda City's industrial production saw a great leap forward, with production increasing by 51%. In the first quarter of this year, it continued to leap forward, increasing by 48.3% compared to the same period last year, completing the quarterly plan. Completing the production plan was not all smooth sailing. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "In the great development of the national economy, it is impossible to have no difficulties." Our plan completion was not good in January, but after overcoming various difficulties, production gradually rose and quickly moved towards a new high tide of leap forward. This change began in February. Taking January's daily output value as 100, February's was 125.1, and March's was 138.1. Now we can conclude that a new high tide of production leap forward is forming. The following examples can prove the above conclusion.

The Battle of Transportation

At the beginning of the year, because we did not grasp transportation work tightly and ruthlessly enough, the loading and unloading time of vehicles at the railway-to-port operation was long, and there were many compressed trains. The Provincial Party Committee required us to compress the one-time operation time to 11 hours, but from January 1st to 13th, the operation time reached 30 hours, with a maximum of 50 hours in one day. The situation was serious. The berthing time of ships in Dalian Port was also serious, reaching 96 hours in mid-January. In this serious situation, some people were worried and doubted the requirements put forward by the Provincial Party Committee. The attitude of the Municipal Party Committee was very clear, only one sentence: "Don't complain first, do it first, then talk."

How to fight this battle of transportation well? We only have three ordinary methods. First, don't hesitate, act immediately. We received the instructions from the Provincial Party Committee on the 11th, the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee studied it on the 12th, a mobilization meeting was held on the 13th, and the first battle started on the 14th. Second, learn from the spirit and practices of Fuxin. Third, fully utilize the effective experiences of 1958. These experiences are: putting politics in command, leading cadres taking the lead, launching a mass movement centered on technological revolution, and organizing communist large-scale collaboration, etc.

Adopting the above methods proved to be effective quickly. First, the operation time of the first battle quickly dropped to 17.7 hours, the second battle dropped to 10.6 hours, and the third battle, under the condition of a large increase in freight volume, also stabilized at 12.3 hours. Second, the relationship between the railway and the port has always been abnormal in the past. This time in the movement, in order to win the battle, the masses criticized departmentalism, and their communist style of selflessness and dedication was greatly enhanced. The whole city also provided strong support. Thus, in the atmosphere of "thousands of troops and horses with great momentum, port, road, factories and mines are one family", the leaders of both sides also adopted effective measures of unified planning, unified indicators, and unified command. The abnormal relationship in the past was broken. The change in the relationship between the two sides promoted the victory of the battle. With victory, the masses were happy, and the cadres were also in a good mood. Third, one of the characteristics of the battle was: not much labor force support from the whole city, mainly launching a mass movement centered on technological revolution. Dalian Port launched a technological revolution movement centered on "three-izations" -- vehicle-ization, slide-way-ization, and earth-mechanical-ization; railway workers vigorously carried out "high platform, low cargo location, and line relocation"; transportation companies carried out earth-mechanical-ization of loading and unloading tools. As a result of the movement, not only was the victory of the battle effectively guaranteed, but also the victory of reducing heavy physical labor and "liberating shoulders" was achieved. The dockworkers were happy, and they sang: "Workers skillfully create, the ground slide-way is realized, no more manual carrying, men and women, young and old can do it." These words on the one hand reflected the urgent demands of the masses; on the other hand, they also showed that in order to have a sustained leap forward in transportation, it is necessary to carry out technological innovation in equipment and tools. Otherwise, relying solely on people's high-intensity labor will not last.

The Battle of Electricity

From September to the end of 1958, the people of Lüda City achieved the first round of victory in the battle against severe electricity shortages. At that time, there was a 30% shortage of electricity, and more than 60,000 kilowatts of electricity were being generated; by the end of the year, industrial production was able to exceed the leap forward plan by 6.8%.

In the first quarter of this year, with the great leap forward in production, the electricity supply remained tight. Thus, the second round of the battle to generate electricity began again. This battle had four aspects: First, withstand the cold wind and fight against the cold wind. In January, those who blew the cold wind seized on the shortcomings of small, indigenous, and mass-run power generation, attacking and saying: "Small, indigenous, and mass-run power generation is not worth the loss." It is true that small, indigenous, and mass-run power stations have their technical and economic shortcomings, but in the fourth quarter of last year, it was precisely relying on these small, indigenous, and mass-run power stations with shortcomings that a large number of factories were able to avoid shutdowns and win the victory in production. Therefore, small, indigenous, and mass-run power stations were not not worth the loss, but at that time were more gain than loss, gain exceeding loss. In the first quarter of this year, there were still a group of factories that withstood the cold wind and insisted on small, indigenous, and mass-run power generation, thus successfully completing their production tasks. Second, based on last year's experience, rectify, consolidate and improve small, indigenous, and mass-run power stations, so that they can pass the technical level and improve their economic efficiency, mainly by reducing the fuel consumption quota. Third, small, indigenous, and mass-run are developing in the direction of small, foreign, and mass-run. March 8th was a day of victory for small, foreign, and mass-run. On this day, the third 1,500-kilowatt generator set manufactured by Dalian Shipyard itself generated electricity. Together with other equipment, it generated more than 100,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, using 80,000 for its own use and transmitting 20,000 to 30,000 to the grid. The victory of the shipyard's power generation was equivalent to adding a new force, providing timely help and greatly alleviating the electricity pressure in the city at that time. Fourth, seizing the time, large-scale power stations are rapidly expanded. From September last year, the Second Power Plant began rapid expansion. At the end of the year, it generated electricity by simple methods. On April 2nd this year, with the joint efforts of construction, installation and production units, it successfully generated more than 50,000 kilowatts of electricity. At this point, the people of Lüda City have won the second round of victory. Now they are confidently moving forward towards capturing the electricity pass.

The Battle of Steel

The start-up of the two "pioneers" of transportation and electricity created conditions for the "marshal" to take command. Around February, Dalian Special Steel Plant launched a new and greater leap forward upsurge. Taking January's daily steel production level as 100, February's was 121.5, and March's was 168.9. With these achievements, the steel plant was able to complete the first quarter's national plan nine days ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 15%.

In terms of electric furnace utilization coefficient, the average in 1958 was 30.08 tons, 33.389 tons in January this year, 35.419 tons in February, and 37.389 tons in March. Because the electric furnace utilization coefficient continues to increase, after winning the national championship for four consecutive years, the steel plant won the national championship again in the first quarter.

The main reason why Dalian Steel Plant was able to achieve the above achievements is that they not only have soaring enthusiasm, but also can carry out technological innovation with the spirit of continuous revolution. In 1958, the first steelmaking workshop creatively adopted the "three-gas steelmaking method" (electricity, oxygen, gas) and other measures, so the electric furnace utilization coefficient increased by 32.9% compared with 1957. In the first quarter of this year, they continued to innovate and create boldly. For example, Liu Hongxi, the furnace chief of the Red Star Youth Furnace, after exploration and experimentation, changed the high-temperature slag removal used in steelmaking in the past to low-temperature slag removal, shortening the slag-making time; carried out oxygen blowing in the reduction period, maintaining the temperature of the reduction period, and increasing the desulfurization efficiency by one time; because of this improvement, the smelting time was further shortened, the reduction period of each furnace of steel was 50 to 60 minutes in the past, and now it is shortened to 30 to 40 minutes.

Dalian Steel Plant not only has high output, but also high quality. In the first quarter, the qualified rate of electric furnace steel reached 99.22%, an increase of 0.78 percentage points compared with the fourth quarter of last year; the converter also passed the test early, and the qualified rate of steel reached 94.48. Steel plant workers are not only good at steelmaking, but also can manufacture rolling mill equipment. In the first quarter, they successfully completed the task of two rolling mills. Now they are determined to increase the daily steel production level in April by another 18% compared with March. In this way, they are fully determined and have the strength to more than double the steel output this year, and are determined to firmly insert the national electric furnace utilization coefficient championship red flag.

Major Battle for Six Major Products

The pioneers have started, the marshal has taken command, and now people's attention has turned to the machinery industry. This year, the machinery factories in Lüda City bear arduous tasks, with six major products in everything. Can the machinery industry ensure the six major products? The answer is yes. The reason why we dare to affirm this is that there is a strong contingent of machinery workers in the city, who can withstand the test of production battles.

The first is Dalian Shipyard. This is one of the red flag factories recently rated in Lüda City. In 1958, the shipyard not only exceeded the leap forward plan, but also built the first 5,000-ton freighter in August; in September, they self-designed and self-manufactured a large 3,000-horsepower marine diesel engine in 85 days; in November, China's first 10,000-ton ocean-going vessel was launched, creating an advanced record of 58 days for the slipway cycle. These achievements of the shipyard made not only domestic visitors happy, but also Soviet sailors excited. One sailor said after visiting: "Give your shipbuilding workers 15 pounds of meat, and you can manufacture a person."

Among the six major products undertaken by Lüda City, there are two 750 rolling mills and twenty 1,500-kilowatt steam turbines. One is large and heavy; the other is precise work. These arduous tasks are undertaken by the shipyard. Now, judging from the results of the battle, these two products can be completely captured. But from the process of the battle, we must not underestimate the arduousness of the task. The steam turbine battle can illustrate this point.

A 1,500-kilowatt steam turbine needs more than 1,400 moving blades and more than 400 stationary blades. One blade is less than the size of a palm, but it is the most difficult pass in processing. Last November, the turbine workshop of the shipyard accepted this task. At first, they underestimated the small blades, and had the attitude of "holding Wu Dalang, not treating him as an immortal", saying: "We have done everything with large machines of 10,000 tons, small blades are not a problem." In this way, they treated the blades as Wu Dalang, and started working on the lathe. As a result, one was scrapped for every one they made, and none were produced in November. They barely produced two in December, but left 25 major problems. In the trial operation, they were either consuming too much gas or had low efficiency. When problems arose, they had to send people out to "learn from experience". The "experience" was brought back, but the way people did it was: for the eighteen processes of blade processing, Harbin had more than 100 special milling machines, Shanghai had more than 80, while the shipyard only had eight. What to do? The method is still the one that has been effective in the past, that is, "thousands of rules, ten thousand rules, the mass line is the first rule". Thus, cadres, workers, and technicians in the workshop were mobilized to speak out and attack the difficulties one by one. Workers described the battle at the time saying: "There are eight levels of power station technology, seizing every second, workers, cadres and technicians, will not return home until the difficulties are solved." Sure enough, with the efforts of the three combinations, the difficult passes were captured. Their method was: without milling machines, they used lathes instead of milling machines; without grinding machines, they used one lathe for two purposes, milling first and then grinding; to ensure precision, each process had a special fixture to deal with. In this way, the work that could only be done by fifth-grade craftsmen in the past can now be done by apprentices; in the past, two pieces could be produced in one shift, but now more than 80 pieces can be produced. In March, because the blade pass was passed, Lüda City was able to complete the task with one more unit exceeding the plan. Now the turbine workshop is addicted to processing blades, and they are worried that if they complete the task after May, the heroes will have no use. Therefore, they requested additional tasks, hoping to add a little more pressure.

The battle of the rolling mill, due to time constraints, can only be omitted.

Fighting with the six major products is another factory that was rated as a red flag factory in Lüda City, Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant. The characteristic of the locomotive factory is that they are both good at fighting with severe raw material difficulties and good at fighting with collaborative parts difficulties. From February 1st to 25th, they only completed two locomotives. Many people were worried about them. But in the last few days, they created a record of assembling ten locomotives in 60 hours. In the first quarter, a total of fifty locomotives were completed, exceeding the plan by three.

Fighting with the six major products and supporting equipment are another group of factories that have been selected as red flag units, such as Crane Factory, Valve Factory, Wafangdian Ball Bearing Factory, and Machinery Factory No. 2, etc. In addition, there is a group of machinery factories that have been tested by last year's great leap forward. They are fully confident of achieving "guaranteed quality, guaranteed quantity, guaranteed sets, guaranteed time" and completing the task ahead of schedule. For example, according to regulations, the first 750 rolling mill should be delivered at the end of August, but the shipyard has successfully captured the large-scale component casting pass. Now they are taking advantage of the victory to attack and strive to basically complete the task four months in advance. And strive to present a gift to the Party on "May Day".

In the battle with the six major products, the units that have exerted their strength also include chemical, petroleum, cement, glass, light industry, textile, and food factories, many of which have also been rated as red flag factories in the city. They not only consciously gave way, but also carried out five contributions (contributing materials, electricity, labor, equipment, transportation tools) to ensure that the key points pass. But giving way does not mean not completing their own tasks. On the contrary, while giving way, they tried every means to tap potential, overcome difficulties, and complete tasks. Therefore, under the premise of ensuring the key points, the city's industrial production completed the first quarter's plan with an excess of 0.6%.

What does the industrial production in the first quarter illustrate? It shows that industry in 1959 can continue to leap forward, and it is already leaping forward. It also shows that even if there are many difficulties in production, as Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "As long as we are prepared and work hard to overcome them, then no difficulties can prevent us from achieving victory." All of these once again prove that the Party's general line is completely correct; it proves that the whole set of two-legged walking policies put forward by the Party in 1958 is completely correct; it proves that the whole set of practices such as vigorously launching mass movements, vigorously carrying out technological revolution, and vigorously carrying out communist collaboration put forward by the Party is completely correct.

Since the Great Leap Forward, our work has had achievements and shortcomings. But we believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, adhering to the Party's general line, relying closely on the masses, guarding against arrogance and impetuosity, being modest and prudent, doing things honestly, then we can correct our shortcomings, maintain progress, and finally we will definitely be able to achieve the victory of continuous leap forward. And we are confident of completing the task ahead of schedule and exceeding the plan.

    旅大工业向新的高潮跃进
    胡明代表的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的报告，拥护李富春、李先念二位副总理的报告和彭真同志的报告。现在我就旅大市的工业情况作一发言。
    一九五八年旅大市的工业生产出现了大跃进，生产增长百分之五十一；今年第一季度，又继续跃进，与去年同期比，生产提高了百分之四十八点三，完成了季度计划。完成生产计划并不是一帆风顺的，正如周总理在报告中所指出的：“在国民经济的大发展中，不可能没有困难”。一月份我们的计划完成不够好，但在克服了各色各样的困难之后，生产由逐步上升，迅即走向新的跃进高潮，二月即开始了这个变化。如以一月份日产值为一百，则二月份为一百二十五点一，三月份为一百三十八点一。现在可以得出结论说，新的生产跃进高潮正在形成。以下的例子就可证明上述的结论。
    交通之战
  　年初，由于我们对于交通运输工作抓得不紧、不狠，因而，车辆在铁路到海港的一次作业时间内，装卸时间长、压车多。省委要求我们一次作业时间压缩到十一小时，但一月一号到十三号作业时间达三十小时，最高一天达五十小时，情况严重。大连港内船舶停留时间也严重，一月中旬达九十六小时。在此严重情况下，有人对省委提出的要求担心、怀疑。市委的态度则很明确，只有一句话：“先不叫苦，干了再讲。”
    如何打好交通这一仗？我们只有三条普通的办法。一、不要犹豫，立即行动。十一号接到省委指示，十二号市委常委研究，十三号开动员会，十四号就开始打第一个战役。二、学习阜新的干劲和做法。三、充分运用一九五八年行之有效的经验。这些经验是：政治挂帅，干部带头，大搞技术革命为中心的群众运动和组织共产主义大协作等。
    采取上述做法果然迅速见效。一、第一个战役作业时间迅速降到十七点七小时，第二个战役降到十点六小时，第三个战役在货运量大大增加的条件下，也稳定在十二点三小时。二、过去铁路和海港的关系一直是不正常的。这一次运动，群众为争取战斗的胜利，批判了本位主义思想，他们大搞协作，舍己为人的共产主义风格大为高涨。全市也进行大力支援。于是，在“千军万马声势大，港路厂矿是一家”的风气下，双方领导也采取了统一计划、统一指标、统一指挥的有力措施。过去不正常的关系被冲破了。双方关系改变，促进了战斗的胜利。有了胜利，群众高兴，干部的心情也舒畅了。三、战斗特点之一是：全市的劳动力支援的并不多，主要是大搞以技术革命为中心的群众运动。大连港掀起三化——车子化、滑道化、土机械化为中心的技术革命运动；铁路职工大搞“高站台、低货位、线路搬家”；运输公司则开展装卸工具的土机械化运动。运动结果，不但有力地保证了战斗的胜利，而且还取得减轻笨重体力劳动和“解放肩膀”的胜利。码头工人高兴了，他们唱道：“工人巧干来创造，地面滑道实现了，人抬肩扛用不着，男女老少都能搞”。这些词句一方面反映了群众的迫切要求；另一方面也说明了要交通运输持久跃进，就必须从设备和工具方面大搞技术革新。不然，单凭人的高强度劳动是持久不下去的。
    办电战斗
    从一九五八年九月到年底，旅大市人民在和严重的电的困难战斗中，取得了第一回合的胜利。那时，缺电百分之三十、办电六万多瓩；年底，工业生产得以超额百分之六点八完成了跃进计划。
    今年一季度，随着生产大跃进，电力供应依然紧张。于是，第二回合的办电战斗又开始了。这一次战斗，内容有四：一、顶住冷风，和冷风作战。一月间，吹冷风的人，他们抓住小、土、群办电的缺点，攻击说：“小、土、群办电得不偿失”。不错，小、土、群电站有其技术上和经济上的缺点，但去年第四季度，正是依靠这些有缺点的小土群，大批工厂得以避免停产，并取得生产战斗的胜利。因此，小土群电站，不是得不偿失，而在当时是得多失少，得超过了失。今年一季度，依然有一批工厂，顶住冷风，坚持小土群办电，因而胜利地完成了生产任务。二、根据去年的经验，整顿、巩固提高小土群电站，使其过好技术关，并提高其经济效果，主要是降低燃料的消耗定额。三、小土群向小洋群方向发展。三月八日，是小洋群取得胜利的一天。这一天，大连造船厂自己制造的第三台一千五百瓩的发电机组发出了电，加上其它设备，每天发出十多万度电，自用八万，向电网输送二、三万度。造船厂办电的胜利，无异是添了一支生力军，他们雪里送炭，对当时市内所遭受的电的压力大为缓和不小。四、抢时间、大洋群电站快速扩建。从去年九月开始，第二发电厂进行快速扩建。年底，以简易方法发出了电。今年四月二日，在施工、安装及生产单位的共同努力下，胜利地发出了五万多瓩4容量的电。至此，旅大市人民又取得第二回合的胜利。现在他们正在满怀信心地向着攻下电力这一关而继续前进。
    钢铁之战
    交通、电力两位“先行官”的上马，为“元帅”升帐创造了条件。二月前后，大连特殊钢厂就掀起了新的更大的跃进高潮。如以一月份钢的日产水平为一百，则二月为一百二十一点五，三月为一百六十八点九。有了这些成绩，大钢得以提前九天、超额百分之十五，完成了第一季度国家计划。
    电炉利用系数方面，一九五八年的平均数为三十点零八吨，今年一月为三十三点三八九吨，二月为三十五点四一九吨，三月为三十七点三八九吨。由于电炉利用系数不断提高，钢厂在连续四年取得全国冠军的红旗之后，第一季度又取得了全国冠军。
    大连钢厂所以能够取得上述的成就，主要是由于他们不但有冲天的干劲，而且能以不断革命的精神，进行技术革新。一九五八年，第一炼钢车间创造性地采用了“三气炼钢法”（电气、氧气、煤气）及其它措施，因而电炉利用系数比一九五七年提高百分之三十二点九。今年第一季度，他们继续革新，大胆创造，如红星青年炉的炉长刘洪喜同志，他在经过摸索、试验之后，将过去炼钢所采用的高温扒渣改为低温扒渣，缩短了造渣时间；进行了还原期吹氧，保住了还原期的温度，提高脱硫效率一倍；由于这一改进，就进一步缩短了冶炼时间，过去每炉钢的还原期为五十至六十分钟，现在缩短到三十至四十分钟。
    大连钢厂不但产量高，质量也高。一季度电炉钢的合格率达到百分之九十九点二二，比去年第四季度提高百分之零点七八；转炉也提早过了关，钢的合格率达到九十四点四八。钢厂职工不但善于炼钢，而且还会制造轧钢设备。一季度他们已胜利地完成了两台轧钢机的任务。现在他们决心在四月份把钢的日产水平比三月份再提高百分之十八。这样，他们就完全有决心和力量，在今年把钢的产量再翻一番以上，并决心把全国电炉利用系数的冠军红旗紧紧插牢。
　　大战六大产品
    先行上了马，元帅升了帐，现在人们的注意力就转到机械工业方面。今年，旅大市的机械厂，肩负着艰巨的任务，六大产品样样都有。究竟机械行业能否确保六大产品呢？回答是肯定的。我们所以敢于肯定，是由于市内有一支强大的机械工人的队伍，他们是经得起生产战斗的考验的。
    首先是大连造船厂。这是最近被评为旅大市的红旗工厂之一。一九五八年，造船厂不但超额完成了跃进计划，而且在去年八月他们造出第一艘五千吨货轮；九月，他们以八十五天的时间，自己设计，自己制造一台大型船用三千马力柴油机；十一月，中国第一艘万吨级远洋轮下水，创造了船台周期五十八天的先进纪录。造船厂的这些成就，不但国内参观者们高兴，就连苏联海员们也同样兴奋。有一位海员参观后说：“给你们造船工人买十五斤肉，你们就可以制造出一个人来”。
  　旅大市所承担的六大产品中，有两台七五○轧钢机和二十台一千五百瓩的汽轮机。一个是大而重；一个是精密活。这些艰巨任务就由造船厂承担。现在，从战斗的结果来看，这两个产品是完全可以攻下来的。但从战斗的过程来看，就绝不能对任务的艰巨性估计不足。汽轮机战斗即可说明这一点。
    一台一千五百瓩的汽轮机，需要有一千四百多个动叶片，还要有四百多个静叶片。一个叶片还不到巴掌大，但它却是加工中最难的一道关。去年十一月，造船厂的轮机车间接受了这个任务。起初，他们对小叶片估计不足，大有“拿着武大郎，不当神仙待”，说什么：“大机万吨都干过，小小叶片不在话下。”这样，他们把叶片当做武大郎，一上车床就干。结果，干一个报废一个，十一月份一台没有出。十二月勉强出两台，但留下了二十五个大问题，在试运转中，不是耗气大，就是效率不高。出了问题只好派人出外“取经”。“经”是取来了，可是人家的干法是：针对叶片加工的十八道工序，哈尔滨有一百多台专用铣床，上海有八十多台，而造船厂只有八台。怎么办？办法还是过去行之有效的那一条，即“千条，万条，群众路线第一条”。于是车间的干部、工人、技术人员都动员起来了，一关一关的鸣放；一关一关的攻打。工人描写当时战斗的情况说；“电站技术有八关，分秒不让抢时间，工人干部技术员，不解难关家不还。”果然，在三结合的努力下，难关攻下来了。他们的办法是：没有铣床，就以车代铣；没有磨床，就一车两用，前铣后磨；为了确保精密度，每道工序都有一台专用胎具来对付。这一来，过去只能由五级大工匠干的活，现在徒工也能干了；过去一班生产两片，现在可以出八十多片。三月，由于过了叶片这一关，旅大市得以超额一台完成了任务。现在轮机车间对加工叶片上了瘾，他们担心过了五月完成了任务，英雄也就无用武之地了。因此，他们要求追加任务，希望再加一点压力。
    轧钢机的战斗，因时间关系，只好从略。
    同六大产品作战的，还有另一个被评为旅大市红旗厂之一的大连机车车辆厂。机车厂的特点是，他们既善于和严重的原材料困难战斗，也善于和协作件的困难战斗。二月从一号到二十五号，他们只完成了两台机车。许多人为他们担心。但他们在最后几天，创造了六十小时组装十台机车的记录。一季度，共完成五十台机车，以超额三台完成了任务。
    同六大产品和配套设备进行战斗的，还有另一批被评选为红旗单位的工厂，如起重机厂，阀门厂，瓦房店滚珠厂和机械二厂等。此外，还有一批经过去年大跃进考验的机械工厂等。他们完全有把握做到“保质、保量、保套、保时”，提前完成任务。比方，按照规定，第一台七五○轧钢机应在八月底交货，但造船厂已经胜利地攻下了大型部件铸造这一关，现在，他们正在乘胜进攻，争取提前四个月基本完成任务。并力争在“五一”节向党献礼。
    在同六大产品的战斗中，出了力量的单位，还有化工、石油、水泥、玻璃、轻工、纺织、食品工厂等，其中有很多工厂也被评选为全市的红旗工厂。他们不但自觉地让了路，而且还进行五献（献材料、电力、劳动力、设备、运输工具），确保重点过关。但让路并不等于不完成本身的任务，相反，在让路同时，他们千方百计，挖掘潜力，克服困难，完成任务。因而全市的工业生产，在确保重点的前提下，以超额百分之零点六完成了第一季度的计划。
    第一季度的工业生产说明了什么问题呢？说明，一九五九年工业可以继续跃进，而且已经在跃进。也说明，哪怕生产中的困难很多，但正如周总理在报告中所指出的：“只要我们有准备，并且努力去克服，那末，任何困难都不能阻挡我们取得胜利。”以上这些，又再一次证明了党的总路线是完全正确的；证明了一九五八年党所提出的一整套两条腿走路的方针是完全正确的；证明了党所提出的大搞群众运动、大闹技术革命、大搞共产主义协作等一整套做法是完全正确的。
    大跃进以来，我们的工作有成绩也有缺点。但我们相信在党中央毛主席的领导下，在省委的领导下，坚持党的总路线，紧紧依靠群众，戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎，老实办事，那么，我们就可以改正缺点，保持进步，最后就一定可以取得继续跃进的胜利。而且有把握提前超额完成任务。
