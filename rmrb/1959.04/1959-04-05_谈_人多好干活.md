On "Many People Make Work Easier"
    He Beiren

"Many people make work easier" is an old saying everyone knows. Its meaning is simple and easy to understand, so I haven't thought about it deeply. It was only after participating in a voluntary labor that I realized this saying is not as simple as I usually understood it. Many people can make work easier, but also not easier. To make many people really make work easier, some other conditions are necessary.

Our labor this time was at night. More than forty people went, and the work was simple: to load a large pile of half-bricks onto a truck and transport them to another place to build a pigsty. Although the work was simple, everyone was very enthusiastic. Plus, the bright moon was overhead that night, and the spring breeze was blowing on our faces, adding a touch of poetry to the labor, making us especially energetic.

As soon as the truck arrived, everyone swarmed around it, throwing bricks onto the truck with a crash. The people in the back were afraid of hitting the people in the front, so they shouted at the front to be careful while throwing. For a moment, there was shouting and the bricks were flying. It really looked like a big battle, but the effect was not good. The people in the front did throw the bricks into the truck, and some in the back also threw them into the truck, but some hit the truck's side and fell outside. More than twenty minutes passed and the truck was still not full, but two or three people had already smashed their feet and bumped their heads.

Everyone felt that this was not working and we should think of a way. Someone suggested that we should strengthen the "organization" of the labor. So everyone lined up, one team on the left, one team on the right, and another team behind the truck. One person picked up the bricks and passed them to the head of the line in turn, and the head of the line threw the bricks into the truck. In this way, with three-way siege, it seemed orderly, and until the truck was full, there were no more incidents of smashing or bumping people.

After the truck drove away, several worker comrades saw the problem again. It turned out that everyone had bricks under their feet, and there was no need to form a long line of more than ten people to pass them from a distance. This kind of transfer made a brick pass through the hands of more than ten people before it could be loaded onto the truck, wasting time in vain. They said: "We should reduce some 'processes'." So the teams were made smaller and more numerous. This time there were four teams on the left, four teams on the right, and two teams behind, turning a three-way siege into an ambush from ten sides. Each team had four to five people, three or four people picking up and passing bricks, supplying one person to throw them into the truck. In this way, the speed was much faster, and the truck was fully loaded in less than ten minutes.

A few short hours of labor have taught me some truths:

First, many people do not necessarily make work easier. "Good work" should have two aspects: one is that the work is smooth and convenient; the other is that each person does a lot of work (if it is detailed work, there is also good quality). To make many people make work easier, there must be a condition: that is, to enable everyone to stretch their hands and feet and facilitate the play of everyone's strengths and enthusiasm. If this is not the case, the more people there are, the more obstructive and difficult it will be to work.

Second, to make many people make work easier, we must strengthen the organization of labor. The more people there are, the more organization is needed. Collective labor must be organized. Such simple collective labor as ours must be organized, and complex collective labor must be even more organized; our kind of manual collective labor must be organized, and collective labor using tools and operating machinery must be even more organized. Moreover, the more lean and tight the labor organization, the easier it is to work. In terms of total amount, the more people there are, the easier it is to work, but in terms of specific labor organization, the more compact, the easier it is to work. This is called small within the large, few within the many. If organization is the soul of the collective, it is not an exaggeration!

    谈“人多好干活”
    何北仁
    “人多好干活”，是句人人都知道的老话了，意思很浅显，容易懂得的；所以没有深想过。经过了一次义务劳动才发现，这句话并不像我平常理解的那末简单，人多可以好干活，也可以不好干活，要使人多能够好干活，还得有一些别的条件。
    我们这次劳动是在夜间，去了四十多个人，干的活很简单：把一大堆半头砖，装上汽车，运到另一个地方去修猪圈。活虽然简单，但大家热情很高。加上那晚明月当头，春风拂面，给劳动添装了一番诗意，使得我们格外有精神了。
    汽车一来，大家便一窝蜂似的围了上去，乒乒乓乓地向车上扔起砖头来。后边的人怕碰到前边的，一面扔一面喊前边的人小心，一时人声呐喊，砖头飞扬，看起来也的确像一场大战，不过效果却不佳，前边的人，砖是都扔进车里去了，后边的也有扔进车里的，也有碰在车梆上掉在车外的，二十多分钟过去了还没有装满车，倒先有两三个人砸了脚，碰了头。
    大家都觉得这么着不行，应该想点办法。有人便出主意说，要加强一下劳动的“组织”。于是大家排成队，左边一队，右边一队，车后面再站一队，一个人拾砖，挨次传给排头，排头再把砖头扔进车里去。这样一来，三路围攻，便显得秩序井然，直到装满一车，也再没有发生砸人和碰人的事。
    车开走以后，几个工人同志又看出了问题。原来我们每个人脚底下都是砖，根本没有必要排成十多人的长行从远处传递。这样传递，反而使一块砖经过十多个人的手才能上车，白白地浪费时间。他们说：“应该减少一些‘工序’。”于是又把队化小了，分多了。这次是左边四队，右边四队，后边两队，三路围攻变成了十面埋伏。每队有四至五人，三四个人捡砖和递砖，供一个人往车里扔，这末一来速度快的多了，不到十分钟便满装一车。
    短短的几个小时的劳动，使我悟得了一些道理：
    第一，人多并不一定好干活。“好干活”应该有两个方面：一是活干起来顺当、便利；一是每个人干的活多（倘是细活，就还有质量好）。在人多的情况下要好干活，就得有一个条件：这就是，能够使每个人都展得开手脚，而且便于发挥每个人的长处和积极性。如果不是这样，人越多反会越碍手碍脚，不好干活。
    第二，要使人多好干活，就要加强劳动的组织，人越多越要有组织，集体劳动总是有组织的劳动才行。像我们这样简单的集体劳动要有组织，复杂的集体劳动就更要有组织；我们这种徒手的集体劳动要有组织，使用工具和操纵机械的集体劳动就更要有组织。而且，劳动组织越精悍严密，就越好干活，从总量上来说是人越多越好干活，但从具体的劳动组织来讲，却是越紧凑越好干活的。这就叫作大中有小，多中有少。倘说组织是集体的灵魂，也不过分的吧！
