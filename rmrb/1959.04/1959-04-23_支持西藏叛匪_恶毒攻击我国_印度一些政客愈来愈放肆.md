Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 22nd: Leaders of the Indian Praja Socialist Party and some other parties, who are actively taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion to stir up trouble, are busy trying to defend themselves under the condemnation of fair public opinion at home and abroad, while continuing to agitate, viciously attack China, and do their utmost to undermine Sino-Indian friendship.

After the publication of the "People's Daily" Observer's commentary in Beijing on April 15, the chairman and secretary-general of the Praja Socialist Party hurriedly issued a statement on the 16th, saying that "the Praja Socialist Party's attitude towards the Tibetan issue has been seriously misunderstood." However, at a meeting of the National Executive Committee of the Praja Socialist Party on April 18, a resolution was passed expressing "deep sympathy" for the Tibetan rebels and supporting their so-called "right to self-determination." The resolution described the armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group in an attempt to maintain the dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system as a "sudden eruption of emotions that have been simmering for the past four years against a people's revolution attempting to eliminate Tibet's distinct characteristics—kindness, self-sufficiency, and non-aggression towards others." One of the party's leaders, Mehta, wrote in an article published in the "Statesman" on April 17, even more openly stated that Tibet had always been independent in the past, "and therefore can never agree to being merely a province of China." He agreed with the former British special agent in Tibet, Richardson, that the relationship between China and Tibet was a "suzerainty that has lapsed." The confessions of these leaders of the Praja Socialist Party fully demonstrate that the Beijing "People's Daily" Observer's commentary did not "misunderstand" them.

Some leaders of the Indian National Congress are also clamoring for the same argument. Mrs. Kripalani, the general secretary of the National Congress, publicly stated at a gathering organized by the so-called "Delhi Tibet Affairs Committee" on April 17 that before 1950, "Tibet was actually an independent country."

The leaders of these parties spare no effort to support the Tibetan bandits in India. They disagree with any "restrictions" on the activities of the Tibetan bandits in India and advocate allowing them to openly engage in treasonous activities on Indian soil. Mehta said at a gathering in Delhi on April 17 that he had recently spoken with the bandit leader Lukhangwa, who told him that these "Tibetans (bandits) will not seek refuge in India" but are determined to "fight to the death." Mehta expressed that India should "allow the Tibetan people to express their demands for freedom." He also said: "India should not be satisfied with merely granting the Dalai Lama political asylum, but should allow him to conduct his struggle for freedom with dignity from here. If India wants to restrict his freedom and treat him merely as a pampered dependent, then its sympathy for the Tibetan people will be considered lip service, useless and ineffective."

The aforementioned resolution of the Praja Socialist Party also pretentiously stated that "the Executive Committee earnestly hopes to maintain and strengthen the friendly relations between China and India," but Mehta, the leader of this very party, said at a gathering on April 17 that he doubted the sincerity of the friendship of communist countries, saying: "India will not accept such friendship from any country."

At a symposium held in Delhi on April 19, Madhok, a leader of the Indian People's League, also clamored that Tibet is an issue related to India's security.

These people not only undermine Sino-Indian friendship but also try their best to provoke relations between China and other neighboring countries in Asia. In an article published in the "Statesman," Mehta unscrupulously slandered that "China's actions in Tibet endanger Asian unity," that China violates the Bandung spirit, and promoted that "almost all Southeast Asian countries have become less trusting of China, and the Tibetan incident can only increase this distrust."

### 支持西藏叛匪　恶毒攻击我国  印度一些政客愈来愈放肆

    支持西藏叛匪　恶毒攻击我国
    印度一些政客愈来愈放肆
    新华社22日讯　新德里消息：积极利用西藏叛乱事件兴风作浪的印度人民社会党和其他一些政党的领导人，在国内外公正舆论的谴责下，一面忙着辩解，一面继续进行煽动，恶毒地攻击中国，竭力破坏中印友谊。
    4月15日北京“人民日报”观察家评论发表以后，人民社会党的主席和秘书长在16日连忙发表声明，说“人民社会党对西藏问题的态度被严重地误解了”。但是，就在4月18日人民社会党全国执行委员会的会议上又通过了一项决议，对西藏叛乱分子表示“深切同情”，并且支持他们的所谓“自决权利”。决议把西藏上层反动集团发动的企图维护黑暗的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度的武装叛乱，描写成为“过去四年来一直暗中沸腾的情绪突然爆发成为反对企图消灭西藏鲜明特性——和善、自给自足和不侵犯别人——的人民革命”。这个党的一位领袖梅达4月17日在“政治家报”上发表的文章更公然说，西藏过去一直是独立的，“因此决不可能同意仅仅是中国的一个省”。他同意前英国在西藏的特务理查逊的说法，即中国同西藏的关系是“已经失效的宗主权”。人民社会党这些领导人的自白，充分说明了北京“人民日报”观察家的评论并没有“误解”他们。
    印度国大党某些领导人也叫嚷着同样的论点。国大党总书记克里帕拉尼夫人4月17日在所谓“德里西藏事务委员会”组织的一次集会上公然说，在1950年以前“西藏实际上是个独立的国家”。
    这些党的领导人不遗余力地支持在印度的西藏叛匪。他们不同意对在印度的西藏叛匪的活动有所“约束”，而主张让他们在印度土地上公开地进行叛国活动。梅达在4月17日德里的集会上说，他最近同叛匪头子鲁康娃谈过话，鲁康娃告诉他这些“西藏人（叛匪）不会寻求在印度避难”，而决心“战斗到死”。而梅达表示印度应当“允许西藏人民表达争取自由的要求”。他还说：“印度不应该满足于仅仅给达赖喇嘛政治避难权，而应该允许他从这里体面地进行他争取自由的斗争。假如印度要限制他的自由，把他仅仅当作一个娇养的寄人篱下的人看待，那么它对西藏人的同情将被认为是嘴巴上的同情，是没有用和没有效的。”
    在人民社会党上述决议中也装模作样地说到，“执行委员会迫切希望保持和加强中国和印度之间的友好关系”，但是，就是这个党的领导人梅达在4月17日的集会上说，他怀疑共产主义国家的友谊是否真诚，他说：“印度不会从任何国家接受这种友谊。”
    在4月19日在德里举行的一次座谈会上，印度人民同盟一位领导人马多克也叫嚷说，西藏是关系到印度安全的问题。
    这些人不仅破坏中印友谊，而且还极力挑拨中国同亚洲其他邻国的关系。梅达在“政治家报”上发表的文章中大肆诬蔑“中国在西藏的行动危害亚洲的团结”，中国违反万隆精神，并宣传“几乎所有的东南亚国家都已经不大信任中国，西藏事件只能增加这种不信任的程度”。
