Xinhua News Agency, Havana: The Cuban "Revolutionary News" newspaper, organ of the July 26th Movement, published a statement on the 20th by Premier Castro, who is currently visiting the United States. In this statement, Castro discussed the truth of his televised broadcast speech on the 19th on NBC's "Meet the Press". A United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 19th had said that Castro stated in the broadcast that "Cuba will abide by its treaty obligations and will side with the West in any conflict with Russia."

"Revolutionary News" said when publishing Castro's statement on the 20th that we have never trusted foreign news agencies' dispatches, nor do we completely trust the sincerity of the interpreters who did simultaneous interpretation for NBC. Therefore, in order to clarify certain contents of Dr. Castro's "Meet the Press" on Sunday, we contacted him. The newspaper pointed out that Castro spoke to the newspaper's deputy editor alone by telephone from the Cuban Embassy in the United States, saying that he had told the American newspaper publishers that "Cuba has not declared the abolition of its international treaties and will maintain these treaties." Castro added, "When someone asked what I would do in an open war between democracy and communism, I replied: We do not agree with communism, but democracy has many shortcomings. People must be given more than theoretical democracy… That is all I said.”

    卡斯特罗揭穿美记者谣言
    他并未说将在东西方冲突中站在西方一边
    新华社哈瓦那讯　古巴7月26日运动机关报“革命报”20日刊登了正在美国访问的卡斯特罗总理向这家报纸发表的声明。卡斯特罗在这篇声明中，谈到他19日在向美国全国广播公司“与报界见面”发表电视广播演说的真相。合众国际社19日从华盛顿发出的一则消息中曾经说，卡斯特罗在广播中表示“古巴将遵循自己的条约义务，在同俄国的任何冲突中将站在西方一面。”
    “革命报”20日在发表卡斯特罗的声明时说，我们从来就不信任外国通讯社的电讯，对美国全国广播公司做同声传译的译员的诚意也不完全相信。因此，为了弄清卡斯特罗博士星期日“与报界会见”中的某些内容，我们和他进行了联系。报纸指出，卡斯特罗从古巴驻美大使馆用电话单独向这家报纸的副社长的谈话说，他对美国报业出版者说过，“古巴并没有宣布废除它的国际条约，并且要保持这些条约”。卡斯特罗又说，“当有人问我在民主和共产主义的公开战争中要做些什么的时候，我回答说：我们不同意共产主义，但是民主有很多缺陷。必须给人民比理论上的民主更多的东西……这就是我所说的全部的话。”
