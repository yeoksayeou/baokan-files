    Preparing Sharp Tools for the Wheat Harvest
    The scene of last year's unprecedented bumper wheat harvest still deeply excites people. This year, in the spring filled with an atmosphere of even greater leaps forward, people can see lush wheat fields like a boundless sea in the vast wheat-producing areas, all presenting a scene foreshadowing a bumper harvest. People are continuing to strengthen field management and prevent and control pests and diseases, doing everything possible to ensure an even greater harvest. In this situation, a new problem has emerged: how to harvest such a large quantity of such good wheat quickly and cleanly?
    This year, wheat in most areas is dense and strong. According to recent surveys in various parts of Henan, the average number of tillers per mu is more than six or seven hundred thousand, and many high-yield plots and high-yield fields reach more than one million per mu. With such dense wheat, it will be difficult to harvest all the wheat in time if it is only harvested little by little with one person and one sickle. The summer harvest and planting season is also the most intense season for agricultural work throughout the year. Taking Henan Province as an example, there are more than 72 million mu of wheat that need to be harvested quickly, more than 81 million mu of late autumn crops to be planted in a timely manner, and more than 40 million mu of major autumn crops that need to be strengthened with field management. According to preliminary estimates, the labor force needed for the wheat harvest will be short by about more than half. In addition to mobilizing urban workers, government cadres, students, and other residents to participate in the rush harvesting campaign during the wheat harvest season, the most fundamental solution is to get labor from tools, mobilize the masses to improve and manufacture harvesting and threshing tools, and increase work efficiency by one to two times. Leaders in many regions have already begun to focus on the reform of summer harvest tools, and some regions have manufactured many harvesting tools that are highly efficient and simple to manufacture. For example, the "Leap Forward" human-pushed harvester created by worker Feng Mingquan of the Nanyang City August 1st Metallurgical Factory can harvest more than 30 mu of wheat a day with two people working in shifts. If similar harvesting tools can be widely promoted in various regions, there will be no worries about the wheat not being harvested.
    While vigorously developing various new harvesting and threshing tools, the repair and improvement of original old-fashioned farm tools should not be neglected. Some areas have lengthened scythes and added bearings to stone rollers, which can also greatly improve work efficiency and are very popular among the masses.
    Party committees at all levels must earnestly strengthen their leadership over the preparation of wheat harvest tools. At present, the most important thing is to quickly select several types of wheat harvest tools that are easy to manufacture and use, highly efficient, and popular among the masses, based on the characteristics of wheat growth in the region, and then test, finalize, manufacture, and promote them. In any case, all the necessary tools must be fully prepared before the wheat harvest to prepare sufficient, sophisticated, and sharp weapons for breaking through the harvest barrier.

    为麦收准备利器
    去年小麦空前大丰收的情景，到现在还深深激动着人心。今年，在充满了更大跃进气氛的阳春里，人们在广大产麦区的千里沃野上，又可以看见像无边的大海似的葱郁的麦田，到处都呈现了一片预兆丰收的景象。人们正在继续不断地加强田间管理和防治病虫为害，尽一切力量确保更大的丰收。在这种情况下，一个新的问题出现了：这样多、这样好的麦子，怎样又快又净地收获到家呢？
    今年大部地区的小麦又密又壮。根据最近河南各地调查，平均每亩分蘖都在六、七十万株以上，许多丰产方和高产田每亩达到一百多万株。这样密茂的麦子，如果单是一人一镰一点一点去收割，就很难及时地把小麦全部收割到家。夏收夏种期间，也正是全年农活最紧张的季节。以河南省来说，有七千二百多万亩小麦需要抢收，有八千一百多万亩晚秋作物要适时种上，还有四千多万亩大秋作物需要加强田间管理。根据初步估算，麦收需要的劳力大约要差一半还多。除了在麦收时节动员城市工人、机关干部、学生及其他居民投入抢收运动以外，最根本的办法是向工具要劳力，发动群众改良和制造收割、脱粒工具，把工效提高一倍到两倍。不少地区的领导方面已经开始大抓夏收工具改革工作，有些地区已经制造出不少工效较高、制造简单的收割工具。如河南南阳市八一冶金制造厂工人冯明泉创造的“跃进式”人推收割机，两人轮班，一天能收割三十多亩麦子。如果各地都能普遍推广类似的收割工具，就不愁小麦收不到家了。
    在大搞各种新式收割工具和脱粒工具的同时，对原有旧式农具的修理和改良也不能忽视。有些地区把镰刀加长，石磙加轴承，也能大大提高工效，很受群众欢迎。
    各地党委都要认真加强对麦收工具准备工作的领导。目前，最主要的是根据本地区小麦生长的特点，迅速选择几种制造和使用方便、效率高、群众欢迎的麦收工具，试验、定型、制造、推广。无论如何，要在麦收以前把所需要的工具都准备齐全，为大破收割关预备好足够的精良的锋利的武器。
