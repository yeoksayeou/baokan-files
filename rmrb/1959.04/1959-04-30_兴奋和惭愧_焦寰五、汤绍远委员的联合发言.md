    Excitement and Shame
    Joint Speech by Committee Members Jiao Huanwu and Tang Shaoyuan

    Chairman, fellow committee members:

    We listened to Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report," which provided us with a profound socialist education and greatly inspired us. We wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's report!

    In 1958, China's Great Leap Forward saw astonishing growth rates and figures across the country in industry, agriculture, basic construction, transportation, postal services, commerce, as well as culture, education, health, and science and technology. This was unprecedented in history! As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, it was "a huge, comprehensive leap forward!" We deeply realize that only under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao could the People's China achieve such brilliant accomplishments! We also further recognize the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system! We still need to study this report carefully to correct and enrich our understanding.

    Most industrialists and businessmen have made progress over the past decade under the Party's cultivation and education, especially after being tempered by the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification campaign, which has greatly improved our ideological understanding. However, this does not mean that our transformation is almost complete and no longer requires further transformation. Just as at the beginning of the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, we were driven and influenced by the workers and peasants to join the ranks of the leap forward, and some of us even made some achievements and were commended. But when the workers and peasants continued to leap forward with soaring enthusiasm, we developed feelings of weariness with transformation. While the workers and peasants were resolutely implementing the general line of socialist construction, many of us lacked a correct and comprehensive understanding of the general line and felt nervous about continuous revolution. Take the two of us, for example. When the Party called for "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward" and "mass steelmaking," we participated in steelmaking and understood some of the principles of "steelmaking and people-making," using steel to drive everything else. But on the other hand, we were calculating economic gains and losses, always thinking it was a bit uneconomical! This shows that we did not truly understand this great call. When the people's communes appeared, instead of rejoicing because they were the best form for us to accelerate socialist construction and transition to communism, we only considered the public canteens and nurseries from a personal perspective! Our understanding of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward was present but insufficient, and also one-sided. All this clearly shows that our political stance has not been transformed well and that we still need to continue the fundamental transformation of our political stance and ideology. We must constantly examine and encourage ourselves with the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao. Premier Zhou said in his report that "the state will pay fixed interest to capitalists according to the original schedule and will actively help them continue their self-education and self-transformation in participating in socialist construction." This once again embodies the Party and the People's Government's care and concern for industrialists and businessmen! We are ashamed, ashamed that we did not work hard enough in the Great Leap Forward of 1958! We are excited, excited that the Premier's report has pointed out the direction of our efforts and guides and encourages us to move forward! We must work actively under the leadership of the Party, contribute all our strength to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan, and strengthen the transformation of our political stance and ideology in our work to repay the boundless kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!

    We agree with and support the work report made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, and we are determined to work hard under the leadership of the Party and the Standing Committee to implement the five tasks put forward.

    Fellow committee members, the rebellion of the reactionary upper strata group in Tibet was instigated by imperialism. This rebellion has been quickly quelled. The imperialists' dream of creating an independent kingdom in Tibet has been completely shattered. All the people of our country are cheering this victory, cheering that Tibet will unfold a new page in its construction history, and the lives of the Tibetan people will move towards prosperity and happiness. However, imperialists and Indian expansionists are clamoring, saying that Tibet is not Chinese territory but a country. The shameless behavior of these expansionists blatantly interfering in our internal affairs is completely infuriating! We solemnly warn the imperialists and these Indian expansionists: Tibet is Chinese territory, and the suppression of the rebellion in Tibet is China's internal affair, and no outside interference is allowed!

### 兴奋和惭愧  焦寰五、汤绍远委员的联合发言

    兴奋和惭愧
    焦寰五、汤绍远委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们听了周总理所作的“政府工作报告”，使我们受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，给了我们极大的鼓舞，我们衷心拥护周总理的报告！
    一九五八年，我国的大跃进，在全国各地，不论工业、农业、基本建设、运输、邮电、商业以及文教、卫生、科学技术发展的速度，增长的数字都是惊人的，历史上从来没有过的！正如周总理在报告中指出的，“是一个巨大的、全面的跃进！”我们深深体会到：只有在英明的中国共产党和毛主席领导下的人民中国，才有可能取得这样辉煌成就！也进一步认识到社会主义制度的无比优越性！我们还需要很好的学习这一报告，来端正和充实自己的认识。
    我们多数工商业者，十年来在党的培养和教育下是有进步的，特别是经过了反右、整风的锻炼，思想认识又有很大提高，但这决不是改造的已经差不多而不再需要改造了。如同在工农业生产跃进的开始，我们是被工人农民带动着、影响着也投入了跃进行列，有人还作出一些成绩并受到表扬，但是当着工人农民不断跃进干劲冲天的时候我们又出现了厌倦改造情绪；工人农民在坚决贯彻社会主义建设总路线，而我们很多人对总路线还缺乏正确的和全面的认识，对不断革命感到紧张。就拿我们二人来说吧，当着党号召“以钢为纲、全面跃进”“全民炼钢”的时候，我们是一面投入了炼钢，也懂得一些炼钢炼人，以钢带动一切的道理，但另一面又在算经济账、算小账，总认为是有点不合算！这说明我们对这一伟大号召并没有真正理解。人民公社出现了，没有为了它是我们加速社会主义建设和过渡到共产主义最好形式而欢欣鼓舞，反而从个人出发只考虑什么公共食堂和托儿所！对于全面大跃进有认识，又认识不足，还有片面，这一切清楚的说明我们的政治立场还没改造好，仍然需要继续进行政治立场和思想的根本改造。我们要经常以毛主席指示的六项政治标准来检查自己，鞭策自己。周总理在报告中说“对于资本家，国家将按照原定的期限付给定息，并且将积极地帮助他们在参加社会主义建设的工作中继续进行自我教育和自我改造”。这又一次体现了党和人民政府对工商业者的照顾和关怀！我们惭愧，惭愧的是在一九五八年大跃进中努力不够！我们兴奋，兴奋的是总理的报告给我们指明了努力方向，指导着、鼓舞着我们前进！我们一定要在党的领导下积极工作，为完成和超额完成一九五九年国民经济计划贡献一切力量，并要在工作中加强政治立场和思想的改造来报答共产党和毛主席的无限恩情！
    我们同意并拥护李维汉副主席代表政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会所作的工作报告，并决心在党和常务委员会领导下为贯彻实现所提出的五项工作而努力。
    各位委员，西藏上层反动集团的叛乱是帝国主义所策动的，这一叛乱已经被迅速平息了。帝国主义者在西藏制造一个独立王国的梦想完全被粉碎了。我们全国人民都欢呼这一胜利，欢呼西藏在建设上将展开历史上新的一页，西藏人民的生活就将走向繁荣和幸福了。但帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子却大肆叫嚣，说什么西藏不是中国的领土，是一个国家。这些扩张主义分子明目张胆地干涉我国内政的无耻行为，完全令人气愤！我们严正警告帝国主义者和这些印度扩张主义分子：西藏是中国的领土，平息西藏叛乱是中国人民的内政，决不允许外人干涉！
