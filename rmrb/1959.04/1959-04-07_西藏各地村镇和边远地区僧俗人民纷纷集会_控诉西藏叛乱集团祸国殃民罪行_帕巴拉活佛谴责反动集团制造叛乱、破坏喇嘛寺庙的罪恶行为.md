Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 6th: In recent days, the broad masses of monks and lay people in villages, towns, and remote rural and pastoral areas of Tibet have held meetings one after another to denounce the crimes of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique for betraying the motherland and harming the people. The participants in the meetings also unanimously expressed their determination to actively support the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion with practical actions.

　　Two thousand people on the Gyangze Plain unanimously supported the State Council's order at the meeting. The participants pointed out that since they could remember, they could not recall any good deeds done for them by the Tibetan upper-class traitorous clique, but the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army had brought many benefits to the broad masses of the people. Tibetan workers Binba Qunda and others said at the meeting: The benefits brought to us by the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are too numerous to mention. After the Gyangze area suffered a flood in the autumn of 1954, the people received timely relief, and loans were issued to help repair houses. Medical treatment was free, and children could go to school. They expressed their determination to support the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion with practical actions of hard work and strive to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

　　The Tibetan people in Tagong and Bomi areas on the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and Jiangda and Ningjingzong on the banks of the Jinsha River, have also held meetings in recent days. Bagga, the deputy director of the office of the Tagong Jiao-level office, said at the meeting when accusing the bandits of their crimes: "The bandits robbed grain and tea in the Yarlung Zangbo River area, pulled horses and cattle, and even forced the people to take off their boots. They raped nuns and women everywhere, forced the people to become bandits with them, and forced the people to flee in all directions. My family was wiped out by the bandits." Based on his own and his fellow villagers' experiences, he concluded that only by helping the People's Liberation Army to quell the rebellion can the Tibetan people have a happy life.

　　In the Yadong area at the foot of the Himalayas, many Tibetans familiar with the terrain expressed at the meeting that they were willing to be guides for the People's Liberation Army and lead the troops to search for hidden bandits. Tibetan and Han construction workers in the Yadong area said: Wherever road workers are needed, they will go. Losang Nyima, the steward of Dongga Monastery, said: "The bandits are carrying out activities that undermine religion under the banner of 'protecting religion.' For example, the bandits damaged the cars of our monastery and killed the former steward, which is irrefutable evidence. All the lamas in our monastery will support the suppression of the rebellion with practical actions."

　　The herdsmen on the northern Tibetan grasslands compared the measure of dissolving the original Tibetan local government to "seeing the blue sky after parting the dark clouds." More than 3,000 Tibetan and Han workers engaged in production in Banggong Lake on the Qiangtang grasslands, at a meeting celebrating the victory of the rebellion in Lhasa and supporting the State Council's order, guaranteed to do a good job in production and support the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly and cleanly suppressing the rebellion.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 6th: Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, vice chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and honorary president of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, made a statement to Xinhua reporters on the 4th, praising the People's Liberation Army and the staff sent to Tibet by the Central Government for conscientiously implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief, and sternly condemning the crimes of the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet for creating rebellion and destroying lamaseries. Living Buddha Pagbalha is recuperating in a hospital in Lhasa. He received reporters in a clean and bright ward.

　　Living Buddha Pagbalha told reporters: In this full-scale rebellion launched by the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique to betray the motherland, a few reactionary elements in the three major monasteries in Lhasa threatened some lamas to participate in the rebellion, and some monasteries also harbored many bandits. They also used temples to deploy artillery and arrange armed forces, and first shot at the People's Liberation Army. He said that as a devout Buddhist, he was very heartbroken by this matter.

　　Living Buddha Pagbalha said: Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet a few years ago, the Central Government and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet have always conscientiously implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief and the Seventeen-Article Agreement. Some examples can prove this, such as the protection of temples, and religious activities have not been interfered with in any way; the central government has also provided assistance in transportation for lamas and temples to purchase goods from afar. Without the policy of freedom of religious belief, these would not be possible.

　　Living Buddha Pagbalha said that he heard that the Tibetan local government issued 250 guns and more than a dozen boxes of ammunition to Sera Monastery, and many lamas in Sera Monastery took off their robes, put on secular clothes and went to participate in the rebellion. Living Buddha Pagbalha said that he had received three letters from the rebels from Shannan, the first letter asked him to send people to participate in the rebellion, but he did not send anyone. The second letter asked him to send 100 packs of tea to the rebels, and later two lamas from Drepung Monastery came to him to ask for these teas, but he did not send them either. Soon after, he received a third letter, further threatening him, saying "If you don't send people or tea, you will suffer in the future when the Central Government is destroyed." Living Buddha Pagbalha said that after the Tibetan local government launched the rebellion on March 10, when he moved to a certain agency stationed in Lhasa by the Central Government, the rebels also said: "Pagbalha must return to Sera Monastery quickly, otherwise his residence will be attacked."

　　Living Buddha Pagbalha said: Since the rebels launched the rebellion, they have occupied some temples and fired at the People's Liberation Army and various agencies stationed in Tibet by the Central Government from those temples. They said it was to protect the temples. He asked: If it is really to protect the temples, why run into the temples? Why shoot at the People's Liberation Army and the agencies stationed in Lhasa by the Central Government in the temples first? He said: But the People's Liberation Army tried its best to get them to surrender during the suppression of the rebellion, hoping that they would mend their ways and start anew.

　　Speaking of this, Living Buddha Pagbalha said: Recently, I saw in the Tibet Daily that American imperialism said that suppressing the Lhasa rebellion destroyed the freedom of religious belief, which is completely a rumor and fabricated out of thin air. In the temple, according to Buddhist rules, as a lama, a Buddhist, one is not allowed to carry guns or knives, let alone kill people. However, in this rebellion, the rebels took up guns and knives and attacked the People's Liberation Army first. It is completely right for the People's Liberation Army to punish them, because they are not real Buddhists, not real lamas, but bad people in lama's clothing.

　　When the reporter told him that the people of Tibet were deeply saddened and mourned when they learned that the patriotic and progressive lama Sonam Gyatso Kenchung (Pagbalha's brother) was killed by the rebels, Living Buddha Pagbalha was very indignant. He said: The rebels killed him without any reason. The main reason is that he has always supported the Central Government, loved the motherland, and opposed imperialism. He was killed just because of this. He said that Sonam Gyatso was a devout lama, and they killed a lama for no reason, which is even more a violation of Buddhist precepts and an arbitrary destruction of religious belief. Living Buddha Pagbalha is the Living Buddha of the famous Changdu Monastery in Tibet. He has been studying Buddhism in Lhasa for the past few years.

    西藏各地村镇和边远地区僧俗人民纷纷集会
    控诉西藏叛乱集团祸国殃民罪行
    帕巴拉活佛谴责反动集团制造叛乱、破坏喇嘛寺庙的罪恶行为
    新华社拉萨6日电　西藏各地的村、镇和边远地区的一些农村、牧场的广大僧俗人民连日来纷纷举行集会，声讨西藏上层反动集团背叛祖国、残害人民的罪行。参加集会的人们还一致表示要以实际行动积极支援人民解放军平息叛乱。
    江孜平原的两千名群众在集会上一致拥护国务院的命令。参加集会的人们指出，自从他们记事以来，就想不起西藏上层叛国集团曾经给他们做过一件什么好事，但是共产党和人民解放军给广大人民带来了很多好处。藏族民工宾巴群达等人在会上说：共产党解放军带给我们的好处说不完，1954年秋天江孜地区遭受水灾后，老百姓得到了及时的救济，并发给贷款帮助修房子，治病不要钱，孩子还能上学读书。他们表示要以努力生产的实际行动，支援解放军平息叛乱，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。
    雅鲁藏布江畔塔工、波密地区和金沙江边江达、宁静宗的藏族人民，连日来都举行了集会。塔工基巧级办事处办公室副主任巴嘎在会上控诉叛匪罪行时说：“叛匪在雅鲁藏布江一带抢粮要茶，牵马拉牛，甚至强迫脱下老百姓的靴子，到处奸淫尼姑、妇女，胁迫老百姓跟他们当叛匪，逼得老百姓四散逃亡，我的家庭就是被叛匪扫光的一个。”他根据自己和乡亲们的遭遇得出结论说：只有帮助解放军平息叛乱，藏族人民才能有幸福生活。
    在喜马拉雅山麓的亚东地区，许多熟悉地形的藏胞在集会上纷纷表示愿为解放军做向导，带领部队搜寻隐藏的叛匪。亚东地区藏、汉族修建工人表示：哪里需要修路工人，他们就到哪里去。东噶寺的管家洛桑尼玛说：“叛匪打着‘保护宗教’的旗帜，而实际上进行着破坏宗教的活动，如叛匪打坏了我们寺院的汽车，杀害了前任管家就是铁证。我们全寺喇嘛要以实际行动支援平息叛乱。”
    藏北草原上的牧民们把解散原西藏地方政府的措施，比做“拨开乌云见青天”。在羌塘草原班戈湖从事生产的三千多名藏、汉族职工，在庆祝拉萨平叛胜利和拥护国务院命令的集会上，保证搞好生产，支援解放军彻底干净地平息叛乱。
    新华社拉萨6日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员、中国佛教协会西藏分会名誉会长帕巴拉·卓列朗杰活佛，4日对新华社记者发表谈话，赞扬人民解放军和中央派到西藏的工作人员认真贯彻执行宗教信仰自由政策，并严厉谴责西藏上层反动集团制造叛乱、破坏喇嘛寺庙的罪恶行为。帕巴拉活佛正在拉萨某医院养病，他在一间整洁明朗的病房里接见了记者。
    帕巴拉活佛对记者说：在这次西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动的背叛祖国的全面叛乱中，拉萨三大寺的少数反动分子威胁一部分喇嘛参加了叛乱，有些寺庙还窝藏了许多叛匪，他们还利用寺庙安置大炮，布置武力，首先向人民解放军射击。他表示作为一个虔诚的佛教徒，对这件事很痛心。
    帕巴拉活佛说：自从西藏和平解放几年以来，中央和进藏的人民解放军是一直认真执行宗教信仰自由政策和十七条协议的。随便举出一些事例都能证明这一点，如寺庙受到保护，宗教活动没有受到任何干涉；喇嘛寺庙需要从远处购买物品，中央还在运输方面给他们帮助。如果没有宗教信仰自由政策，这些都是不可能的。
    帕巴拉活佛说，他听说西藏地方政府发给色拉寺二百五十支枪，十多箱子弹，色拉寺有许多喇嘛脱了袈裟，换上俗装去参加了叛乱。帕巴拉活佛说，他曾经收到叛乱分子从山南写给他的三封信，第一封信里要他派人去参加叛乱，他没有派。第二封信又要他给叛乱分子送一百包茶叶去，后来还有两个哲蚌寺的喇嘛来向他要这些茶叶，他也没有送。不久，又接到第三封信，进一步对他威胁，说什么“如果不派人或送茶叶去，将来把中央消灭了，你们就要吃亏”。帕巴拉活佛说，当3月10日西藏地方政府发动叛乱后，他搬住在中央驻拉萨某机关时，叛乱分子还说：“帕巴拉要赶快回色拉寺，不然就要攻打他的住地。”
    帕巴拉活佛说：叛乱分子自从发动叛乱以后，就占据了一些寺庙，并从那些寺庙里向人民解放军和中央驻在西藏的各机关进行射击。他们说是为了保护寺庙。他问：如果是真正保护寺庙，为什么要跑到寺庙里来呢？为什么要在寺庙里首先向人民解放军和中央驻拉萨的机关射击呢？他说：但是人民解放军在平叛中，尽量争取他们投降，希望他们改邪归正，重新做人。
    谈到这里，帕巴拉活佛说：最近我从西藏日报上看到，美帝国主义说平息拉萨叛乱是把宗教信仰自由破坏了，这完全是造谣，无中生有。在寺院里，以佛规来说，作为一个喇嘛，一个佛教徒，是不准拿枪、拿刀的，更不准杀人的。但是，在这次叛乱里，叛乱分子拿起枪刀首先打了解放军，解放军对他们进行惩罚是完全应该的，因为他们并不是真正的佛教徒，不是真正的喇嘛，而是披着喇嘛外衣的坏人。
    当记者告诉他，西藏各地人民知道爱国进步的喇嘛索朗降措堪穷（帕巴拉之兄）被叛乱分子打死都很沉痛哀悼的时候，帕巴拉活佛非常愤慨，他说：叛乱分子打死他，没有什么理由，最主要的理由就是他一直拥护中央，热爱祖国，反对帝国主义，就因为这一点便把他打死了。他说，索朗降措是一个虔诚的喇嘛，他们无故打死一个喇嘛，更是违背佛教教规，是对宗教信仰的任意破坏。帕巴拉活佛是西藏著名大寺院昌都喇嘛寺的大活佛，最近几年来他一直在拉萨学经。
