    Imperialists Are Not Allowed to Slander Our Religious Policy

    The Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata, colluding with the imperialist Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and foreign reactionaries, gathered rebellious bandits, carried out armed rebellion, and brutally harmed the Tibetan people, and launched a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa. This is entirely a criminal act of undermining the unification of the motherland and splitting national unity. The State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion and thoroughly quell the rebellion is a wise and timely measure that fully conforms to the interests of the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country. In the past few days, people of all ethnic groups across the country have gathered to express their heartfelt support for the State Council's order, to express their joy and encouragement for the rapid suppression of the rebellion by the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa, and to express their deep happiness that the Tibetan compatriots will gradually embark on the bright road of prosperity and progress. The victory of the people is the defeat of the enemy. In the past few days, imperialists and foreign reactionaries, seeing that the Tibetan rebellion was quickly quelled and their conspiracy failed, after their wailing, they resorted to their usual trick—fabricating rumors and slandering. The U.S. State Department recently issued successive statements, maliciously slandering our government's suppression of Tibetan rebels as "destroying religious and political autonomy." These shameless lies are completely blatant falsehoods.
    Facts speak louder than words. Religious belief in New China is free and has always been protected by law. Article 88 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China has explicit provisions, and the central and local people's governments at all levels have conscientiously implemented this policy. Not only are legitimate religious activities protected, but also all religions in China enjoy the same political rights as all national people's organizations. There are more than 400 Catholic clergy and believers who have been elected as deputies to the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels, such as Li Weiguang, Bishop of the Nanjing Diocese, Hu Wenyao (believer), President of the Shanghai Second Medical College, and Tong Shaosheng (believer), Deputy Governor of Sichuan Province, all of whom are deputies to the first and second sessions of the National People's Congress. There are also more than 400 Catholics participating in the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and local CPPCC committees at all levels. This fully shows that all citizens of the People's Republic of China, regardless of ethnicity or religious belief, are equal in political status and rights. Our country is a multi-religious country. Among the people of the whole country, there are Buddhists, Muslims, Taoists, Christians, and Catholics. Our temples, mosques, Catholic churches, and chapels where we chant sutras, worship Buddha, pray, and worship stand on the land of China with their doors open, and every devout believer can enter and exit without hindrance. We Catholics deeply feel that after liberation, we are no longer deceived by imperialist elements and counter-revolutionary elements, and we enjoy true freedom of belief. In our church's sanctuary, there is Mass every morning, and on feast days and Sundays, there is Mass in the evening, and the Bible is also taught.
    Imperialists and reactionaries always want to confuse religion and politics to confuse and deceive the people. This is their usual trick. We know that the Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata are engaged in the reactionary act of betraying the motherland and undermining national unity. They even took up weapons, commanded reactionary bandits, and carried out bloody riots to brutally harm the people, burning, killing, looting, and brutally harming patriotic officials and masses in Tibet. They are engaged in political conspiracies under the guise of religion, which has nothing to do with religion at all. What our State Council ordered the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa to quell was armed rebellion, not legitimate religious gatherings; what was dissolved was the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion, not temples and lamas. The Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army also reiterated in its proclamation the religious policy of "respecting the religious beliefs and customs of the masses and protecting lama temples." However, the U.S. State Department ignores the facts and attempts to use its long-bankrupt magic weapon to publish absurd remarks in the name of religion. This is to slander and distort the religious policy of our Central People's Government and sow discord in the unity of our people of all ethnic groups. It is the most despicable and shameless words and deeds, and we religious figures express our firm opposition.
    We want to warn the U.S. State Department that the era of attempting to use religious names to provoke national divisions and expand colonialism is gone forever. Any rumors, slanders, and provocations you make about the Tibetan rebellion are in vain.

    不许帝国主义者诬蔑我们的宗教政策
    中国天主教友爱国会主席  沈阳总主教区主教  皮漱石
    中国天主教友爱国会副主席　曹道生
    西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，纠集叛匪，进行武装叛乱，残害西藏人民，并向人民解放军驻拉萨部队发动全面进攻。这完全是破坏祖国统一，分裂民族团结的罪恶行为。国务院命令解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府，彻底平息叛乱，这是英明而及时的措施，完全符合西藏人民和全国人民的利益。几天来，全国各地各族人民纷纷集会，对国务院的命令，表示衷心拥护；对人民解放军驻拉萨部队迅速平息叛乱，表示欢欣鼓舞；对西藏同胞将逐步走上繁荣进步的光明大道，表示万分庆幸。人民的胜利，就是敌人的失败。几天来帝国主义者和国外反动派，鉴于西藏叛乱之迅速平息，它们的阴谋没有得逞，哀鸣之余，便又施展它的惯技——造谣诬蔑。美国国务院最近即连续发表声明，恶毒地诬蔑我国政府讨伐西藏叛乱分子是要“摧毁宗教和政治自治”，这些无耻谰言，完全是瞪着眼睛说瞎话。
    事实胜于雄辩。新中国的宗教信仰是自由的，一贯受到法律保护的，中华人民共和国宪法第八十八条中有明文规定，中央和各级人民政府也都认真贯彻了这一政策。不仅对正当的宗教活动加以保护，而且中国各宗教和全国各人民团体一样在政治上享受着同等的权利。天主教的神职人员和教徒，被选为全国和各级地方人民代表大会代表的，即有四百多人，如南京教区主教李维光，上海第二医学院院长胡文耀（教徒），四川省副省长童少生（教徒），都是全国人民代表大会一、二届的代表。天主教徒参加全国政协和各级地方政协委员会的，也在四百人以上。这充分说明，凡是中华人民共和国的公民，不分民族，不分宗教信仰，在政治地位和权利上都是平等的。我国是一个多宗教的国家，全国人民当中，有信佛教的，有信伊斯兰教的，有信道教的，有信基督教的，有信天主教的。我们念经拜佛、祈祷礼拜的寺庙、清真寺、天主堂、礼拜堂等，矗立在中国的土地之上，敞开着大门，每一个虔诚的信徒都出入无阻。我们天主教徒深深感到，在解放后，我们不再受帝国主义分子和反革命分子欺骗了，我们享受了真正的信仰自由。在我们教会的圣堂里，每天早晨都有弥撒，每逢占礼和主日，晚上也有弥撒，还讲圣经。
    帝国主义者和反动派，总是要把宗教和政治混淆起来，迷惑和欺骗人民，这是他们的惯技。我们知道，西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，作的是背叛祖国，破坏民族团结的反动勾当，他们竟然拿起武器，指挥反动匪徒，进行残害人民的血腥暴乱，烧杀抢掠，残害西藏爱国官员和群众。他们是在宗教外衣的掩护下进行政治阴谋活动，丝毫与宗教无关。我国务院命令人民解放军驻拉萨部队平息的是武装叛乱，而不是正当的宗教集会；解散的是策动叛乱的西藏地方政府，而不是寺庙喇嘛。人民解放军西藏军区在布告中还重申“尊重群众宗教信仰和风俗习惯，保护喇嘛寺庙”的宗教政策。但是美国国务院却无视事实，妄图使用早已破产了的法宝，假借宗教名义发表荒谬言论，这是诬蔑和歪曲我中央人民政府的宗教政策，挑拨离间我各族人民的团结，是最卑鄙无耻的言行，我们宗教界人士表示坚决反对。
    我们要警告美国国务院，企图利用宗教名义挑起民族分裂而从中扩展殖民主义的时代，已经一去不复返了。你们对西藏叛乱事件的任何造谣诬蔑和挑拨离间，都是枉费心机的。
