　　Always Uphold the Rectification Spirit
　　Wang Pu
    "The rectification movement is over, but the rectification spirit must never be abandoned."

    This is a sentence spoken by a worker in Shanghai in a big-character poster. Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, mentioned this big-character poster, believing that it is applicable to every cadre, and called on all cadres to uphold the rectification spirit.

    What is the rectification spirit? It is to consciously and actively overcome the subjectivism and bureaucracy, and other erroneous ways of thinking and working, that are divorced from reality and the masses, and to establish the Marxist-Leninist way of thinking and working that closely links with reality and the masses. In industrial and mining enterprises, if you want to connect with reality and the masses, you must consult with the masses when things happen, and you must hand over the "bottom line" of the production plan, as well as the favorable and unfavorable conditions for completing the plan, to the masses, and rely on everyone to come up with ideas; when solving major production and livelihood problems, you must mobilize the masses to speak out freely, air views fully, hold great debates, and post big-character posters to fully expose all contradictions in the process of things developing; enterprise leaders participate in productive labor, appear as ordinary laborers, and share weal and woe with the masses; combining with engineering and technical personnel and skilled workers to engage in "experimental fields" and using typical examples to drive the general is also an important leadership method. In 1958, on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement, various enterprises effectively overcame and prevented subjectivism and bureaucracy in their leadership work, the minds of the workers and masses were lively, their moods were happy, and the genuine comradeship-style mutual assistance and cooperation between superiors and subordinates, and between left and right, was further developed. This also led to a heated mass movement and a great leap forward tide like ten thousand horses galloping. The great victory of production and construction in 1958 was a victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction, and also a victory for the rectification spirit.

    In the ideological field, if correct things do not occupy the position, wrong things will occupy it. We adhered to the rectification spirit yesterday, prevented and overcame subjectivism and bureaucracy, and achieved results. However, if we become complacent and depart from the spirit of rectification, it will be difficult to avoid repeating the mistakes of being divorced from reality and the masses. Therefore, at all times, we must adopt an attitude of resistance to subjectivism and bureaucracy, not only fighting against them in the rectification movement, but also fighting against them in peacetime. As the saying goes, "A frequently turned door hinge does not decay, and flowing water does not become stagnant." We must constantly prevent and overcome the unhealthy tendencies of subjectivism and bureaucracy.

    Without the rectification spirit, there would be no vigorous mass movement, and without a vigorous mass movement, there would be no great leap forward. In order to accelerate socialist construction, we need a great leap forward every year, a great leap forward every month, and a great leap forward every day. Therefore, we must adhere to the rectification spirit every year, adhere to the rectification spirit every month, and adhere to the rectification spirit every day.

### 永远坚持整风精神

　　永远坚持整风精神
　　王朴
    “整风运动是结束了，整风精神永远不能丢掉。”
    这是上海一位工人在一张大字报里讲的一句话。中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施同志谈到这张大字报，认为对每个干部都是适用的，号召全体干部一定坚持整风精神。
    什么是整风精神呢？就是自觉地积极地克服脱离实际、脱离群众的主观主义和官僚主义等错误的思想作风，树立密切联系实际、联系群众的马克思列宁主义的思想作风。在工矿企业里，你要联系实际，联系群众，有事就得和群众商量，就得把生产计划，以及完成计划的有利条件和不利条件的“底”交给群众，依靠大家出主意；在解决生产上、生活上重大问题的时候，就得发动群众大鸣、大放、大辩论、贴大字报，把事物发展过程中各个矛盾，充分暴露出来；企业领导者参加生产劳动，以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和群众同甘共苦：同工程技术人员、技术工人结合搞“试验田”，以典型带动一般，也是一种重要的领导方法。1958年，各个企业在整风运动胜利的基础上，有效地克服和防止了领导工作中的主观主义和官僚主义，职工群众思想活泼，心情舒畅，上下之间、左右之间真正的同志式的互助合作关系得到了进一步的发展。也就产生了热火朝天的群众运动，掀起了万马奔腾般的大跃进高潮。1958年生产和建设的伟大胜利，是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，也是整风精神的胜利。
    在思想领域里，正确的东西不去占领阵地，错误的东西就去占领。我们昨天坚持整风精神，防止和克服了主观主义和官僚主义，取得了成绩。但是，如果我们自满起来，离开整风的精神，那就难免再犯脱离实际和脱离群众的毛病。所以，不论任何时候，我们对于主观主义和官僚主义，都必须采取抵制的态度，不仅在整风运动中与之作斗争，在平时也要与之作斗争。古语有云：“户枢不蠹，流水不腐”。要时时防止和克服主观主义和官僚主义的歪风。
    没有整风精神，便没有轰轰烈烈的群众运动，没有轰轰烈烈的群众运动，便没有大跃进。为了加速社会主义建设，我们需要年年大跃进，月月大跃进，日日大跃进，因此，我们就要年年坚持整风精神、月月坚持整风精神，日日坚持整风精神。
