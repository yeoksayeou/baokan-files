Everyone Learn Pinyin, Speak Putonghua
Wu Yifang Delegate Discusses Jiangsu's Promotion of Hanyu Pinyin and Popularization of Putonghua

I fully agree with the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian.

Promoting the Pinyin Alphabet and Popularizing Putonghua are Important Tasks of the Cultural Revolution

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and inspired and driven by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a high tide of cultural revolution has emerged in our province, just as in all parts of the country. The magnificent mass movement to eliminate illiteracy has achieved great success, and the political enthusiasm and learning initiative of the broad masses have been greatly enhanced. Promoting the Pinyin alphabet and popularizing Putonghua are important tasks of the cultural revolution. On the basis of the literacy campaign, we call on the masses to learn Putonghua in order to better use language tools to serve politics and production, and to learn the Pinyin alphabet to annotate Chinese characters, so as to consolidate and expand the achievements of literacy campaigns. This is the inevitable trend of the movement's development. In the past year, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, our province has actively carried out the work of promoting the Pinyin alphabet and popularizing Putonghua, organized many report meetings and symposiums, and widely carried out publicity work through radio stations, newspapers, and magazines. The province, prefectures, cities, and counties have trained a large number of key personnel to teach the Pinyin alphabet and promote Putonghua in a tiered manner. The vast majority of students and young and middle-aged teachers in schools at all levels and of all types throughout the province have participated in the study of the Pinyin alphabet. According to statistics, more than 50,000 key personnel have been trained in the school system, and 6,960,000 primary and secondary school students and 230,000 young and middle-aged teachers have learned the Pinyin alphabet and can speak Putonghua. This work was first promoted in the school system in our province, and at the same time, the Pinyin alphabet was used for literacy pilot projects, and the Pinyin alphabet began to be promoted among workers and peasants. In August last year, Kunshan County launched a mass movement to learn the Pinyin alphabet and Putonghua. After two months, Putonghua was basically popularized and the Pinyin alphabet was promoted among young adults throughout the county. Immediately afterwards, Xinyi, Jintan, Fengxian, Liyang, Wujin, Jiangyin and other counties also successively launched mass learning campaigns throughout the county or in some communes. According to statistics from Kunshan, Xinyi, Fengxian, and Jintan counties, a total of more than 50,000 key personnel for promoting Putonghua have been trained, more than 694,000 people have initially learned Putonghua, and 597,000 people have learned or basically learned the Pinyin alphabet. In the past year, in order to promote Putonghua throughout the province, we have also published 27 kinds of related books.

Pinyin Alphabet is Not Difficult to Learn, Learn it in Twenty Hours
  According to pilot project experience and the promotion situation in various places, it generally takes only about 20 hours for the masses to learn the Pinyin alphabet, which is not as difficult as some people imagine. Promoting the Pinyin alphabet and popularizing Putonghua is the demand of the broad masses, but it is, after all, a new thing. Therefore, at the beginning of the study, some people were embarrassed and afraid of learning. They thought that the Pinyin alphabet was "foreign language," learned in middle school, and we just graduated from literacy classes and could not learn it at all. This kind of ideological concern is not surprising. After they studied for a few days, they could easily understand that the Pinyin alphabet has fewer letters, simpler strokes, is convenient to write, and is easy to learn. Zhu Dama of Xinguang First Cooperative in Kunshan said it well: "People say it is difficult, but I say it is very easy. There are only twenty-six letters. Even if it is a dragon, you can catch it. When we were learning to read, we could recognize dozens of Chinese characters a day. Learning Pinyin, we only learn four or five a day. What is there to be afraid of?" As a result, she learned to recognize and spell all the letters in just five nights. Precisely because of this, the Pinyin alphabet was quickly popularized in Kunshan, Xinyi, and other places.

Use Pinyin Alphabet to Consolidate and Expand Literacy Achievements and Learn Putonghua

The Pinyin alphabet has also shown great advantages in consolidating and expanding literacy achievements. After the elimination of illiteracy in Xinyi County, due to being busy with autumn harvesting, autumn planting, steelmaking, and water conservancy projects, the literacy consolidation work did not keep up in time, so the phenomenon of "relapse" occurred in some areas. After the implementation of the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet, in places where the teaching of Pinyin was well integrated with literacy teaching, students not only consolidated the Chinese characters they had already learned, but also recognized more new characters. According to the results of an inspection in 66 classes with 977 people in Xinyi County, 149 people recognized 100 to 500 more characters, 600 people recognized 500 to 1,000 more characters, 16 people recognized more than 1,000 more characters, and the rest also basically eliminated the phenomenon of "relapse." For example, Zhuang Fuyu from the Pao Che Basic Commune, after learning the Pinyin alphabet, has read many annotated popular reading materials, greatly improving his reading ability. He said: As long as the Chinese characters are annotated with Pinyin, I am not afraid of ordinary new characters. I can remember what I have forgotten, and I can learn what I have not learned. The Pinyin alphabet is really my good teacher. The masses in Xinyi County have also achieved good results in learning Putonghua using the Pinyin alphabet. The county is in a Northern dialect area, and only more than 300 commonly used characters are different from Putonghua. After the masses learned the Pinyin alphabet, these local accents were quickly corrected. A barber in Xin'an Town, Xinyi County, after learning the Pinyin alphabet, also found the corresponding rules between some finals in Xinyi and Putonghua. Members of the Pao Che Basic Commune found the corresponding rules between the tones of Xinyi dialect and Putonghua. At present, the enthusiasm of the masses in Xinyi County to learn Putonghua is growing.

Fully Use Literacy Experience to Promote the Pinyin Alphabet and Popularize Putonghua

In the work of promoting the Pinyin alphabet and popularizing Putonghua, all localities have made full use of the experience of literacy campaigns, closely integrated with production under the leadership of the Party, and adopted the approach of launching mass movements, thus achieving remarkable results. In many places, when the masses were working on water conservancy construction sites, carrying soil, digging soil, and pounding the earth, they sang ditties in Putonghua, used Pinyin alphabet songs instead of work chants, and teachers used Putonghua to shout motivational slogans. The masses were very satisfied with this learning method. At the beginning of the movement in Kunshan County, some people also believed that: promoting Putonghua is not like accumulating fertilizer, and it is difficult to make a leap forward. There is no experience, no teachers, no materials, and no teaching aids. How can Putonghua be promoted? However, under the leadership of the Party, the masses were fully mobilized, and all kinds of difficulties were overcome, finally making the work a great leap forward. They relied on literacy cadres and primary and secondary school teachers as the main force, adopted the "snowballing" method, and in a short period of time, trained more than 10,000 teachers, compiled and printed more than 80,000 copies of textbooks and 230,000 copies of vocabulary comparison tables, and created more than 40 kinds of teaching aids. In addition, in terms of methods, they adopted the "two-step" and "simultaneous" approaches according to the different situations of dialects in different regions. Kunshan County's dialect belongs to the Wu language system. Not only is there a big difference between the pronunciation and Putonghua, but there is also a considerable distance in vocabulary. The difference in vocabulary seriously affects people's mutual understanding in ideological communication, and the difference is obvious. At the same time, changing dialect vocabulary is easier for the masses to master than correcting pronunciation, and it is easier to arouse the masses' interest in learning Putonghua and increase their confidence in learning. Therefore, Kunshan's approach is: the first step is to mobilize the masses to imitate Beijing pronunciation and change commonly used dialect vocabulary; the second step is to learn Pinyin and correct pronunciation, in order to improve the quality of Putonghua. Xinyi dialect belongs to the Northern dialect system, and most of the commonly used vocabulary is the same as Putonghua. Therefore, the county adopted the simultaneous method, organizing the masses to imitate and learn Putonghua on the one hand, and learning the Pinyin alphabet on the other hand, and using it to continue to correct pronunciation after learning Pinyin. Both methods have achieved good results.

In the past year, there have also been some shortcomings in the work of promoting the Pinyin alphabet and popularizing Putonghua in our province, mainly manifested in: the consolidation work in schools has not been grasped tightly, so some teachers and students in some areas have experienced different degrees of "relapse" after learning the Pinyin alphabet, and the level of Putonghua has also improved relatively slowly; in the nationwide promotion work, in general, various places did not prepare annotated reading materials before carrying out the work, and the textbooks for the masses to learn culture were not yet annotated, so after the masses learned Pinyin, they did not use the Pinyin alphabet to learn Putonghua and consolidate the Chinese characters they learned for a long period of time, so that the Pinyin alphabet could not fully play its role; in terms of teachers, although a large number of teachers have been trained, in some areas, neither the quantity nor the quality can meet the needs of work development. These shortcomings still need to be further overcome.

This Year, We Will Vigorously Publicize the Significance of Writing Reform, Train Teachers, and Prepare Teaching Materials

1959 will be a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward in China's industrial and agricultural production and scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings, and writing reform work must also be further developed. We are prepared to continue to vigorously publicize the great significance of writing reform, train teachers, and prepare teaching materials. We call on students and young and middle-aged teachers at all levels and of all types of schools to strive to basically achieve the correct and proficient use of the Pinyin alphabet and to speak relatively standard Putonghua within two years. In cities and counties that have already been fully promoted, we will continue to do a good job in consolidation and improvement, and effectively help the masses use the Pinyin alphabet to consolidate literacy achievements and improve their cultural level and Putonghua level. Cities and counties that have not yet been fully promoted will select basic units such as people's communes, factories, mines, and streets to conduct pilot projects, fully accumulate experience, in order to take advantage of the appropriate opportunity to once again launch a mass upsurge in learning the Pinyin alphabet and popularizing Putonghua.

The So-Called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" Exposes the Ambitions of Indian Expansionists

When we saw the so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" published in Tezpur, India, in the People's Daily, I expressed extreme indignation at the acts of imperialism and foreign reactionaries in supporting the armed rebellion in Tibet and interfering in China's internal affairs. The upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet dared to launch a rebellion because they received the support of imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Taiwan, and Indian expansionist elements. The so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" recently distributed by Indian diplomatic officials, whether from the Dalai Lama's usual words and deeds or from the tone of the statement, is obviously not from the Dalai Lama himself, but was imposed on him by others. This statement once again exposes the ambitions of Indian expansionist elements. We want to warn them that they must immediately stop their criminal activities of splitting Tibet from China. Tibet will always be the Tibet of the Chinese people, and our 600 million people will never allow any imperialism or foreign reactionaries to interfere in our internal affairs.

    大家都来学拼音字说普通话
    吴贻芳代表谈江苏推行汉语拼音和推广普通话的情况
    我完全同意周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告。
    推行拼音字母和推广普通话是文化革命重要任务之一
    在党的总路线的光辉照耀下和工农业生产大跃进形势的鼓舞推动下，我省和全国各地一样出现了文化革命的高潮。规模壮阔的群众性的扫除文盲运动，取得了很大的成绩，广大群众的政治热情和学习积极性十分高涨。推行拼音字母和推广普通话是文化革命的重要任务之一，在扫盲运动的基础上号召群众学习普通话，以便更好地运用语言工具，为政治、为生产服务，并且学习拼音字母为汉字注音，以巩固扩大扫盲成果，这是运动发展的必然趋势。一年来，在党和政府的正确领导下，我省积极地进行了推行拼音字母和推广普通话的工作，组织了多次的报告会、座谈会，和通过广播电台、报纸、杂志等广泛进行了宣传工作。省和专区、市、县分级培训了大批教学拼音字母和推广普通话的骨干。全省各级各类学校学生和青壮年教师绝大部分都参加了拼音字母的学习。据统计在学校系统中共培养骨干五万余人，有六百九十六万大中小学生和二十三万青壮年教师学会了拼音字母，能说普通话。这一工作，我省首先是在学校系统推行，同时又用拼音字母进行扫盲试点，开始在工农群众中推行拼音字母。去年八月昆山县开展了全民学习拼音字母和普通话的运动，经过两个月的时间，在全县青壮年中基本上普及了普通话和推行了拼音字母。紧接着，新沂、金坛、丰县、溧阳、武进、江阴等县，也相继在全县或在部分公社中掀起全民学习的热潮。据昆山、新沂、丰县、金坛四个县统计，共培养推广普通话的骨干五万余人，初步学会普通话的群众有六十九万四千余人，学会或基本上学会拼音字母的有五十九万七千人。一年来，为了在全省推广普通话，我们还出版了有关图书二十七种。
    拼音字母不难学，二十小时就学会
  　根据试点经验和各地推广的情况来看，群众学会拼音字母，一般只需要二十小时左右的时间，并不如有些人所想像的那末困难。推行拼音字母和推广普通话是广大群众的要求，但毕竟是一件新的事物。因此，在开始学习的时候，有一些人怕难为情，怕难学。认为拼音字母是‘洋文’，是中学里学的，我们扫盲刚毕业，根本学不会。这类的思想顾虑是不奇怪的。当他们学了几天以后，就很容易理解到：拼音字母字数少，笔划简单，写起来方便，学起来容易。昆山新光一社朱大妈说得对：“人家说难，我说很容易，字母只有二十六个，是条龙也能逮住。扫盲时，我们一天能认几十个汉字，学拼音一天只学四、五个，还有什么可怕的”。结果她只用五个晚上，就全部会认会拼了。正因为如此，所以拼音字母很快地在昆山、新沂等地普遍推行起来。
    利用拼音字母巩固和扩大扫盲成果和学习普通话
    拼音字母对于巩固和扩大扫盲成果，也显示了很大的优越性。新沂县在扫除文盲后，因忙于秋收秋种，大炼钢铁和搞水利工程，扫盲巩固工作未能及时跟上，因此有些地区发生了“回生”现象。在推行汉语拼音字母以后，凡教学拼音与识字教学结合得好的地方，学员不但对已学的汉字得到巩固，而且还多认识一些生字。据新沂县在六十六个班、九百七十七人中检查的结果，多认识一百字至五百字的有一百四十九人、五百字至一千字的有六百人、一千字以上的有十六人，其余的人也基本上消灭了“回生”现象。如炮车基层公社庄富玉，学会拼音字母以后，已经阅读了不少册注音本的通俗读物，大大提高了阅读能力。他说：只要汉字注上音，一般的生字都难不倒我，忘记了的又记起，没学的能自学，拼音字母真是我的好老师。新沂县群众利用拼音字母学习普通话的成绩也很好，该县是北方话区，只有三百多常用字与普通话有差别，群众学了拼音字母以后，这些方音很快地都得到纠正。该县新安镇一个理发工人，学了拼音字母后还找出了新沂一些韵母和普通话的对应规律。炮车基层公社社员则找出了新沂话与普通话声调的对应规律。目前新沂县群众学习普通话的劲头越来越大。
    充分运用扫盲经验推行拼音字母和推广普通话
    在推行拼音字母和推广普通话的工作中，各地都充分运用了扫盲经验，在党的领导下，密切结合生产，采取大搞群众运动的做法，因而取得了显著成绩。许多地方，群众在水利工地上，抬土、挖土、打夯时用普通话唱小调，用拼音字母歌代替号子，教师用普通话喊鼓动口号。这样的学习方法，群众非常满意。昆山县在开展运动初期，也有人认为：推广普通话不是积肥，难以跃进。一无经验，二无教师，三无材料，四无教具，普通话怎样推广？但是在党的领导下充分发动了群众，克服种种困难，终于使工作大大跃进了一步。他们以扫盲干部，中小学教师为主，采用“滚雪球”的办法，在短短的时间内，就培养出一万多名教师，编印了八万余册课本，二十三万份词汇对照表，创造了四十余种教具。另外，在方法上根据方言不同情况，因地制宜采取了“两步走”和“齐头并进”的做法。昆山县方言属吴语系统，不但语音上和普通话差别较大，就是在词汇上也有相当大的距离。词汇的不同，严重影响人们在思想交流时的彼此了解，其中差别显而易见。同时，改变方言词汇比矫正方音易于为群众掌握，易于引起群众学习普通话的兴趣和提高学习的信心。所以昆山的做法是，第一步发动群众模仿京音，改变常用方言词汇；第二步学习拼音，矫正方音，以提高普通话的质量。新沂方言属北方话系统，常用词汇大多和普通话相同，因此该县采取齐头并进的方法，一面组织群众模仿学习普通话，一面学习拼音字母，并在学会拼音以后，用以继续纠正方音。这两种方法，都取得良好的效果。
    一年来，我省推行拼音字母和推广普通话工作，也存在一些缺点，主要表现在：对学校巩固工作抓得不紧，因而有些地区师生学会拼音字母以后，有不同程度的“回生”，普通话水平也提高得较慢；全民推广工作，一般说来，各地在开展之前没有准备注音读物，群众学习文化的课本还未注音，因而群众学会拼音以后，在较长时期内，不利用拼音字母学习普通话和巩固所学汉字，使拼音字母没有能充分发挥作用；在师资方面，虽然培养了大量教师，但有些地区，无论在数量上质量上都不能满足工作发展的需要。这些缺点还有待进一步努力克服。
    今年将大力宣传文字改革的意义，培养师资，准备教材
    一九五九年将是我国工农业生产和科学文化教育事业更大更好更全面跃进的一年，文字改革工作也必须有进一步的开展。我们准备继续大力宣传文字改革的重大意义，培养师资，准备教材。号召各级各类学校学生和青壮年教师，争取在两年内基本上都能做到正确熟练地运用拼音字母，都会说比较标准的普通话。在已经全面推广的市县，继续做好巩固提高工作，有效地帮助群众利用拼音字母巩固扫盲成果，提高文化水平和普通话水平。目前还没有全面推行的市县，将选择有条件的人民公社、厂矿、街道等基层单位进行试点，充分积累经验，以便利用适当时机，再一次掀起全民学习拼音字母和推广普通话的热潮。
    所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，暴露了印度扩张主义者的野心
    当我们在人民日报上看到在印度提斯浦尔发表的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，我对帝国主义和外国反动派支持西藏武装叛乱，干涉中国内政的行为，表示异常的愤慨。西藏上层反动集团所以胆敢发动叛乱是因为他们得到了帝国主义、台湾蒋匪帮和印度扩张分子的支持。最近由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，无论从达赖喇嘛平时的言行，或从声明的口吻来看，显然不是出于达赖喇嘛本人，而是旁人强加于他的。这个声明又一次暴露了印度扩张主义分子的野心。我们要警告他们，他们必须立即停止那种把西藏从中国分裂出去的罪恶活动。西藏永远是中国人的西藏，我们六亿人民决不允许任何帝国主义、外国反动派干涉我国内政。
