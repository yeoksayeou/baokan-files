　　Everybody's Talk

　　A Question on a Slogan
　　People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, a certain unit, Che Wenyi
      “?”
    Do you recognize this character? If you've checked many dictionaries and still don't recognize it, then take a look at the slogan below and you can guess it. The slogan is like this:
    "Carry out socialist communist thought education, establish a joint teaching, research, and production base."
    Then, you will surely realize: Oh, it's the character "xiang" (想, to think)!
    But when you further scrutinize this slogan, you will have some new discoveries.
    “?”, naturally, is a simplified character for "jian" (建, to build). But it is not among the three batches of simplified characters announced by the state. Therefore, it cannot be said to be completely "legal". What is "keyan" (科研)? It can be inferred that it is an abbreviation of "kexue yanjiu" (科学研究, scientific research). But the masses may not understand this abbreviation.
    "Carry out… education," this way of speaking is also a bit awkward. People generally say "carry out… movement," "strengthen" or "conduct… education," but rarely say "carry out… education."
    There are so many problems in a short slogan of just over twenty characters. What is the reason for this?
    To write a large slogan on the wall, in black and white, for thousands to read and tens of thousands to see, this should be a very serious matter, how can it be so careless!

### 一条标语上的问题

　　一条标语上的问题
　　解放军驻北京某部　车文仪
      “?”
    你认得这个字吗？如果查了好多种字典还不认得的话，那么，看看下面这条标语你就可以猜到了。这条标语是这样的：
    “开展社会主义共产主义思想教育，建立教学科研生产联合基地。”
    于是，你定然会恍然大悟：噢，原来是个“想”字！
    但是当你进一步推敲这条标语时，却又会有一些新的发现。
    “?”，自然是个建字。但在国家公布的三批简字中却还没有它。因此也就不能说它已经完全“合法”。科研，是什么呢？可以推测到，是科学研究的省略。但这种省略，群众不一定懂得。
    开展……教育，这种说法也有点别扭。人们一般都说开展……运动，加强或者进行……教育，却很少讲开展……教育。
    在一条短短二十多个字的标语中竟然会有如此之多的问题。这究竟是因为什么呢？
    把一条老大的标语写在墙上，黑白分明，千人念，万人看，这该是一件多么严肃的事情，怎么能够这样轻率呢！
