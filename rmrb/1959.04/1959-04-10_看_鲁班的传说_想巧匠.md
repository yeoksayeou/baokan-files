　　Thinking of Skilled Craftsmen After Watching "The Legend of Lu Ban"
　　Lin Xiao

    When advocating for working skillfully, we easily think of the ancient "Patron Saint of Craftsmen," Lu Ban. Various mythical legends about Lu Ban have been passed down to this day. The film "The Legend of Lu Ban" successfully brought the glorious image of this ancient craftsman to the screen, which can be said to have great practical educational significance.

      "The Legend of Lu Ban," through three short and concise stories of bridge building, temple construction, and corner tower repair, portrays Lu Ban's intelligence and his spirit of skillfully working by concentrating the wisdom of the masses for creative labor. It also generally embodies the infinite wisdom of the Chinese working people.

    Lu Ban was highly skilled and kind-hearted. He traveled extensively, enthusiastically doing many good deeds for the working people and solving many technical problems for fellow craftsmen. Every time he helped others overcome difficulties, he never cared about personal fame or gain, and even did not tell others his name. In Western Shu, Lu Ban helped the master carpenter solve the final difficulty in building a bridge by carving a stone. In Jiangnan, the master carpenter building a temple could not install the main beam because it was not long enough, and the vermilion stone pavilion cover was too heavy. Lu Ban came up with the "fish supporting beam" and "earth piling pavilion" methods to help his fellow craftsman. The story of repairing the corner tower even more prominently demonstrated Lu Ban's rescue of people in danger, his intelligence, and his noble character. The emperor wanted to build four corner towers, and the audience held their breath, concerned about the fate of the master carpenter who was on the verge of death because he failed to complete the design specified by the emperor. At this time, Master Lu Ban pondered hard, staying up all night, and finally designed a corner tower with "nine beams, eighteen pillars, and seventy-two ridges," helping Master Carpenter Li and saving his life, as well as saving more people.

    Although these are three short stories, the plots are closely linked together, effectively highlighting the character of Lu Ban. The film did not mystify Lu Ban. It portrays Lu Ban as an ordinary worker, affirming that Lu Ban can be learned from. The film tells us that Lu Ban's wisdom was not innate. The miracles he created were created through continuous learning and research in the practice of life, absorbing nourishment from the masses, and through diligent labor. In this regard, the film's director arranged a series of thought-provoking plots. For example, when Lu Ban was eating at the home of the master carpenter building a temple in Jiangnan, he came up with the methods of "fish supporting beam" and "earth piling pavilion" for connecting beams and putting the stone pavilion roof on, while using chopsticks to pick up fish and serving rice. The film also uses the technique of interweaving to show how Lu Ban was educated by his mother and wife, improved his operating methods, and saved manpower. These plots are all touching and genuine.

    I especially like the ending of the film "The Legend of Lu Ban." When the corner tower was completed, people were elated and praised Lu Ban's achievements. When Master Carpenter Li, riding on a horse, wanted to give the colorful ball to Lu Ban, Lu Ban flashed into the crowd. People searched for him, saying, "Lu Ban is among us!" Then, the image of Lu Ban was highlighted on the screen, with countless "craftsmen" behind him growing, moving forward, and walking towards the audience. Yes, on all fronts of socialist construction, countless "living Lu Bans" are among us.

    看“鲁班的传说”想巧匠
  　林晓
    在提倡巧干的时候，我们很容易会想起古代“工匠祖师”鲁班。关于鲁班的种种神话般的传说，一直流传到今天。影片“鲁班的传说”，成功地把这位古代巧匠的光辉形象搬上了银幕，不能不说是有着很大的现实教育意义。
      “鲁班的传说”通过造桥、建庙、修角楼三个短小精悍的故事，刻划出了鲁班的聪明和善于集中群众智慧进行创造性劳动的巧干精神，也概括地体现了我国劳动人民的无穷无尽的智慧。
    鲁班手艺高超、心地和善，他遍游南北，热心地为劳动人民做了许多好事，也为同行的手艺人解决了不少技术上的难题。而每次在帮助别人解决了困难以后，从不计较个人名利，甚至连自己的姓名都不告诉别人。在西蜀，鲁班以镌凿一块石头帮助掌墨师解决了造桥的最后困难。在江南，建宗庙的掌墨师因为主梁尺寸不足和朱砂石亭盖太重无法安装，鲁班想出了“鱼抬梁”和“土堆亭”的办法，帮助了自己的同行。在修角楼的故事里，更加突出地表现了鲁班救人之危，表现了鲁班的聪明才智和高尚品质。皇帝要修造四座角楼，观众紧紧地屏住气，关怀着那个由于未能完成皇帝指定设计图样因而命在旦夕的掌墨师的命运。这时鲁班师傅苦苦思索，彻夜不眠，终于设计出了
  “九梁十八柱，七十二条脊”的角楼，帮助了李掌墨师，拯救了他的生命，也拯救了更多的人。
    这里虽然是三个小故事，可是故事的情节却紧紧地联系在一起，有效地突出了鲁班这个人物的性格。影片并没有把鲁班神秘化，它把鲁班当作一个普通的劳动者去描写，肯定鲁班是可以学习到的。影片告诉我们，鲁班的智慧并不是天生的，他所创造的奇迹是在生活的实践中不断地学习、钻研，在群众中吸取滋养，经过辛勤的劳动才创造出来的。在这一点上，电影编导安排了一系列的耐人回味的情节。例如，鲁班在江南建庙掌墨师的家里吃饭，用筷子夹鱼和盛饭时，想出了“鱼抬梁”“土堆亭”的接梁和上石亭顶的方法。影片还用穿插的手法，表现了鲁班如何从母亲和妻子那里受到教益，改进了操作方法，节省了人力。这些情节都使人感到真切动人。
    我特别喜欢电影“鲁班的传说”的结尾。当角楼建成，人们兴高采烈，对鲁班的功绩赞赏不绝，骑在马上的李掌墨师要把彩球送给鲁班的时候，鲁班闪在群众中间，人们寻找他说：“鲁班就在我们中间！”接着，银幕上突出了鲁班的形象，背后是数不清的“手艺人”在成长、在前进，迎向观众走来。是的，在建设社会主义的各个岗位上，无数的“活鲁班”就在我们中间。
