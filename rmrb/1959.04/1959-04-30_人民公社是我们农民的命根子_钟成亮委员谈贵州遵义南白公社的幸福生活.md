Comrade Chairman, esteemed committee members:

I am a peasant from the Nanbai People's Commune in Zunyi City, Guizhou Province. Last September, we enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao and established the people's commune. In a very short period, all socialist undertakings in the commune, including industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, have developed rapidly, the material and cultural living standards of the people have been further improved, and the socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the masses have been unprecedentedly high. Everyone says: The people's commune is the "lifeline" of us peasants and the "iron rice bowl" that guarantees a life of abundance. The masses have composed many folk songs to praise the people's commune and the wise leadership of the Party. One of them goes like this: "The people's commune has many advantages, eradicating poverty with smiles, never forgetting the Communist Party while drinking water, and supporting the elder brothers in production."

It has only been half a year since our commune was established, but all undertakings, including industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, have made significant progress. In terms of industry, as soon as the commune was established last year, we threw ourselves into the mass steelmaking movement. In a short period, we not only produced 1,540 tons of pig iron and more than 240 tons of native steel, but also trained and educated the masses through this movement. In 1958, after the establishment of the commune, 273 small factories were built, and the total industrial output value reached 5 million yuan, an increase of eight times compared to 1957.

In terms of agricultural production, last year we implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," vigorously promoted deep plowing, rational close planting, rational fertilization, improved and used various new tools, and implemented new farming systems. As a result, we achieved unprecedented bumper harvests of grain and cash crops. Taking our Sancha Management District as an example, the average grain yield per mu last year was 1,608 jin, a full doubling compared to 1957 and more than five times higher than the best year before liberation. Other various cash crops, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations have also experienced tremendous growth.

The direct result of production development is the improvement of the people's living standards. We peasants feel this most deeply. Take the situation of the Fourth Team of the Red Star Brigade, where my family is located. This team has a total of 29 households, including 4 landlords and rich peasants, 6 middle peasants, and 19 poor peasants. Before liberation, except for the landlords and rich peasants who lived well, 15 of the 19 poor peasant households did not know where their next meal was coming from, and 2 families lived by begging. Among the 25 middle and poor peasant households, 22 households did not have cotton clothes and could only use straw to keep warm in the cold winter months. After liberation, although they had land and houses after the land reform, they still relied on government loans to make a living. For example, the poor peasant Zhong Chengxiu's family of eight had borrowed 380 yuan from the government. With the strong support of the government, and through several years of mutual aid and cooperation, production improved year by year, and living standards rose year by year. By 1956, the average income per person was about 50 yuan. But the biggest change was last year, when the average income per household reached 350 yuan, and the average income per person reached about 70 yuan. For example, the poor peasant Zhong Xinghua, with a family of eight, earned 650 yuan last year. The whole family purchased two new cotton quilts, two cotton-padded clothes, thirteen sets of unlined clothing, one pair of leather shoes, two pairs of rubber shoes, one set of sanitary clothing, and four small farm tools. Such purchasing power is now commonplace in our commune.

Now, in our commune, the average monthly wage income per laborer is four yuan, and a family has about ten yuan. Coupled with meals and other welfare programs, the actual income per household can reach about 500 yuan a year, and the average per person can reach 100 yuan. Such a living standard is not high nationwide, but compared to our past lives, the changes are truly astonishing. We peasants have learned a truth from our own personal experiences: as long as we always follow the Party and Chairman Mao, and run our commune well, we will definitely become richer and happier.

The improvement of economic life has brought about an improvement in the cultural life of us peasants. Take literacy, for example. After the establishment of the people's commune, the enthusiasm of the masses to learn culture has been unprecedentedly high. Our commune has eliminated illiteracy among 80 percent of young and middle-aged people. We have also newly built three half-day agricultural middle schools, expanded 52 primary schools, and all school-age children have been enrolled.

The establishment of a large number of collective welfare undertakings in rural areas, the universal establishment of public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and maternity hospitals, has brought countless benefits to the peasants. It has not only changed our material and cultural living conditions, but also thoroughly liberated women's labor from household chores, and brought about tremendous changes in interpersonal relationships and people's mental outlook.

Before communization, in the Fourth Team of our Red Star Brigade, only 30 of the 48 male and female laborers could regularly work. Now all 48 are participating in commune and team labor. Because women have been freed from the burden of household chores and have the same rights as men, new aspects have also emerged in family relationships. The most important thing is that new, united, and harmonious family relationships have replaced the old, feudal patriarchal remnants of family relationships. This new family relationship is inseparable from the new moral atmosphere of love of labor, unity, and friendship that has emerged throughout the countryside. There is a poor peasant in our Red Star Brigade named Zhong Wenyuan. Before liberation, because he had no means of livelihood, he could not live with his lover and children for seven or eight years. After liberation, he was allocated land and houses, and the family reunited. However, because Zhong Wenyuan liked to drink, his annual income was not used properly, and the couple often fought, and the family was still not harmonious. After the establishment of the commune, meals were free, and his whole family participated in labor. The man was rated as level four, the woman was rated as level three, and the son was rated as level four. The monthly wage income alone was about ten yuan. The family was happy, and they had not quarreled once since the establishment of the commune. They discussed together how to use their monthly income. Not long ago, each member of their family made a new set of clothes.

This year is a decisive year in the three years of hard work. After listening to Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report," I received profound education and great encouragement. I warmly support it. Our commune, like all communes in the country, will achieve a larger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 than last year. This year, we plan to double the total grain output on the basis of last year, and various cash crops, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations will increase by about 100 percent compared to last year. The total industrial output value is expected to increase by sixteen times compared to last year. Of course, there are difficulties in completing such a task, but with the leadership of the Party, the superior system of the people's commune, the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, and the foundation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we are fully confident to achieve a larger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

### 人民公社是我们农民的命根子  钟成亮委员谈贵州遵义南白公社的幸福生活

    人民公社是我们农民的命根子
    钟成亮委员谈贵州遵义南白公社的幸福生活主席、各位委员：
    我是贵州省遵义市南白人民公社的农民。去年九月我们热烈响应党和毛主席的号召，办起了人民公社。在很短的时间内，社里工农商学兵各项社会主义事业都得到了突飞猛进的发展，人民物质和文化生活水平得到了进一步的改善，群众社会主义觉悟和劳动热情空前高涨。大家都说：人民公社是我们农民的“命根子”，是保证达到丰衣足食的“铁饭碗”。群众编了许多山歌来歌颂人民公社和党的英明领导，有一首是这样唱的：“人民公社好处多，挖掉穷根笑呵呵，饮水不忘共产党，生产支援老大哥。”
    我们公社成立到现在不过半年，但是，工农商学兵各项事业都有飞跃的发展。从工业上来说，去年公社一建立，我们就投入了全民大炼钢铁的运动。在短短的时间里，我们不仅炼出了一千五百四十吨生铁，二百四十多吨土钢，同时，通过这一运动，锻炼和教育了群众。一九五八年，公社成立后，兴建了二百七十三个小型工厂，工业总产值达到了五百万元，比一九五七年增长了八倍。
    在农业生产方面，由于去年我们贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，大力推广深耕、合理密植、合理施肥，改进和使用了多种新式工具，推行了新的耕作制度，因而粮食和经济作物获得了空前的大丰收。以我们三岔管理区为例，去年粮食平均亩产一千六百零八斤，比一九五七年整整翻了一番，比解放前最好的年景增长了五倍以上。其他各种经济作物、林业、牧业、副业都有了巨大的增长。
    生产发展的直接结果是群众生活水平的提高。对这点，我们农民感受得最深。就拿我家所在的红星大队第四小队的情况来说，这个小队共二十九户，其中地主、富农四户，中农六户，贫农十九户。解放前除了地主、富农的生活好过，十九户贫农，有十五家是有上顿没下顿，有两家是要饭过日子。二十五户中、贫农中，有二十二户没有棉衣，寒冬腊月只是用稻草避寒。解放后，经过土地改革，虽然有了土地、房屋，还是靠政府贷款来过生活。如贫农钟成修一家八口人，曾经向政府贷过三百八十元，在政府的大力扶持下，经过几年来互助合作运动，生产一年比一年好，生活一年比一年上升，到一九五六年，每人平均收入有五十元左右。但是变化最大的还是去年，每户平均收入达到了三百五十元，每人平均收入达到了七十元左右。如贫农钟兴华，全家八口人，去年收入了六百五十元，全家新置棉被二床，棉衣二件，单衣十三套，皮鞋一双，胶鞋二双，卫生衣一件，小农具四把。象他家这样的购买力，在我们公社已是平常的事了。
    现在，在我们社里，每个劳动力平均每月工资收入四元，一家人有十元左右，加上吃饭及其他福利事业，每户实际收入一年能达到五百元左右，每人平均达到了一百元。这样的生活水平，在全国是不算高的，但和我们过去生活来比，实在是变化得惊人。我们农民从自己切身体验中，懂得了一条道理，只要永远跟着党走，跟着毛主席走，把我们的公社办好，我们就一定会越来越富裕，越来越幸福。
    经济生活的提高，给我们农民带来了文化生活的提高。拿扫盲来说，人民公社建立后，群众学习文化的积极性空前高涨，我们公社已扫掉了百分之八十的青壮年文盲。还新建了半日制农业中学三所，扩充了五十二所小学，全部适龄儿童都入了学。
    农村大量集体福利事业的兴办，公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、妇产院的普遍建立，给农民带来的好处是说不完的。不仅改变了我们物质、文化生活的状况，而且使妇女劳动力从家务劳动中彻底解放出来，使人与人之间的关系和人的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。
    公社化以前在我们红星大队四小队，四十八个男女劳动力中经常能出工的只有三十个。现在四十八个都参加了社、队劳动。由于妇女摆脱了家务琐事的拖累，和男子得到了同样的权利，在家庭关系上也出现了新的面貌。最主要的就是新的、团结和睦的家庭关系代替了旧的、封建家长制残余的家庭关系。这种新的家庭关系，是和整个农村中出现的热爱劳动、团结友爱的新的道德风气分不开的。我们红星大队有个贫农叫钟文渊，解放前因生活无着，七、八年的时间不能和爱人、孩子生活在一起，解放后，分得了土地、房子，一家人团聚了，但是由于钟文渊好喝酒，每年收入没有用在正份上，两口子就经常打架，家庭仍然不和睦。公社成立后，吃饭不要钱了，他一家人都参加了劳动，男的评为四级，女的评为三级，儿子评为四级，每月光是工资收入就有十元左右，一家人高高兴兴，从成立公社到现在没吵过一次架，每月收入拿回来共同商量使用，前不久，他们一家人每人做了一套新衣服。
    今年是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，我听了周总理“政府工作报告”后，给我深刻的教育和很大的鼓舞，我热烈拥护，我们公社要和全国所有的公社一样，要在一九五九年实现一个比去年更大、更好、更全面的跃进。今年我们计划，粮食总产量在去年的基础上再翻一番，各种经济作物、林、牧、副业都要比去年增长一倍左右，工业总产值预计将要比去年增长十六倍。完成这样的任务当然是有困难的，但是，有党的领导，有人民公社这个优越的制度，有广大群众的冲天干劲，有一九五八年大跃进的基础，我们完全有信心来实现今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
