Xinhua News Agency, April 4th. The Thirteen Tombs Reservoir today released water for irrigation for the first time.

　　At 8:30 AM, the gate was opened, and the reservoir's stored water surged into the water transmission pipeline, slowly flowing through the control gate towards Nanshao Village of the Thirteen Tombs People's Commune, eight miles away. Today, a total of more than 20,000 tons of water was released, irrigating over 600 mu of wheat fields that were growing well but urgently needed watering.

　　The Thirteen Tombs Reservoir was completed on June 20th last year and has accumulated 14.5 million cubic meters of water so far. The maximum water storage capacity of the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir can reach 82 million cubic meters, and under normal circumstances, it can store 60 million cubic meters, which can irrigate 250,000 to 300,000 mu of farmland. The reservoir has four main canals with a total length of 20 kilometers, and many branch canals, secondary canals, and field ditches extend into the fields. This year, it can irrigate more than 70,000 mu of farmland in the Thirteen Tombs People's Commune and another nearby commune.

　　Since the beginning of spring, the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir has carried out large-scale greening work. Many peach trees and willow trees have been planted around the reservoir dam and near the Thirteen Tombs New Village. The fish fry released into the reservoir last November are growing very well.

    十三陵水库首次开闸灌田
    新华社4日讯　十三陵水库今天第一次开始放水灌溉农田。
    上午八时半闸门开放，水库的蓄水涌出输水管道，经过节制闸缓缓流向八里外的十三陵人民公社的南邵村。今天共放了两万多吨水，浇灌了生长良好但急需浇水的六百多亩麦田。
    十三陵水库是去年6月20日建成的，到现在为止已蓄水一千四百五十万公方。十三陵水库最高蓄水量可达八千二百万公方，正常情况下可蓄水六千万公方，能灌溉农田二十五万到三十万亩。水库有四条总干渠道，共长二十公里，还有许多支渠、斗渠、毛渠伸向田间，今年可以灌溉十三陵人民公社和附近另一个公社的七万多亩农田。
    开春以来，十三陵水库进行了大面积的绿化工作。水库大坝的周围和十三陵新村附近都栽种了不少的桃树、柳树，去年11月放养到库内的鱼苗，生长得很好。
