Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Zeng Shan, Minister of the Ministry of Communications of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at an enlarged national telephone conference on transportation convened by the Ministry of Communications on the 10th, called on the broad masses of workers on the transportation front to launch a new and larger-scale production upsurge and strive to fulfill and over fulfill the 1959 transportation tasks.

Zeng Shan listed many facts to illustrate that a new production upsurge in the transportation sector has already begun to take shape. The situation is very good. He then put forward several opinions on how to make this production upsurge widely and deeply developed in all transportation enterprises.

He said: Carrying out a mass movement on the transportation front must be centered on technological revolution and aimed at increasing labor productivity. At present, the main tasks of the transportation sector should be to improve loading and unloading tools for vehicles and ships, improve folk transportation tools, improve road building, port construction, road maintenance tools, and save fuel.

He pointed out that the "two participations, three combinations, and four bigs" working methods and working system must be fully implemented in transportation enterprises. He said that more than 80% of the employees in transportation enterprises are engaged in production and work under mobile and decentralized conditions. Fully utilizing this working method can widely concentrate the wisdom of the masses and improve leadership work. Since the transportation sector added many new employees last year, attention should be paid to strengthening the political and ideological education of new workers.

Zeng Shan talked about the issue of people's communes running transportation. He emphasized: People's communes running transportation is an indispensable part of the entire transportation system. Because without sufficient short-distance transportation capacity to collect and distribute materials for trunk lines, the entire transportation work will be difficult to carry out smoothly.

　　改进运输工具提高劳动生产率
　　曾山同志提出在运输战线上大搞群众运动
    新华社12日讯　中共中央交通工作部部长曾山，10日在交通部召开的全国交通运输扩大电话会议上，号召交通运输战线上的广大职工，掀起一个新的更大规模的生产高潮，为完成和超额完成1959年的运输任务而奋斗。
    曾山列举许多事实，说明交通运输部门新的生产高潮已经开始形成。形势很好。接着他提出了使这个生产高潮在所有交通企业中广泛深入开展起来的几点意见。
    他说：开展运输战线上的群众运动，必须以技术革命为中心，以提高劳动生产率为目的。目前交通运输部门主要应当是改进车船装卸工具，改进民间运输工具，改进筑路、筑港、养路工具和节约燃料等。
    他指出必须在交通企业中全面推行“两参、三结合、四大”的工作方法和工作制度。他说，交通运输企业有80％以上的职工在流动分散的情况下进行生产和工作，充分运用这种工作方法，就可以广泛集中群众智慧，改进领导工作。由于去年交通运输部门增加了许多新职工，应当注意加强对新工人的政治思想教育工作。
    曾山谈了人民公社办运输的问题。他强调指出：人民公社办运输是整个交通运输不可缺少的一个部分。因为没有充足的短途运输力量为干线集散物资，整个运输工作就难于顺利进行。
