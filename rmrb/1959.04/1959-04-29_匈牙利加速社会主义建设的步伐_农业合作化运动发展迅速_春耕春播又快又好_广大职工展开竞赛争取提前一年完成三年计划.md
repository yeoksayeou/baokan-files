    Budapest, April 28th (By our reporter) Since the beginning of 1959, the heroic Hungarian people have accelerated the pace of socialist construction and have achieved brilliant successes in industry, agriculture, and culture.
    In agriculture, the agricultural cooperation movement has developed rapidly, and spring ploughing and sowing have achieved unprecedented results. From January 1st to the end of March this year, 300,000 Hungarian farm households, with nearly 2 million holds of land (each hold equivalent to 8.55 Chinese mu), joined agricultural cooperatives. In 40% of the country's rural areas, all farmers have joined cooperatives, and some fast-developing states have completed cooperation. The cultivated area of cooperatives and state farms has increased from 26.5% of the total cultivated area of the country at the end of last year to 49%. There are now nearly 4,500 agricultural cooperatives nationwide, with 523,000 members.
    Organized with the active support of the entire party and the entire people, the enthusiasm of farmers in politics and production is unprecedentedly high. This year's spring ploughing and sowing work has been the fastest and best completed in recent years. The amount of chemical fertilizer used by cooperatives has more than doubled compared to last year. The work completed by agricultural machinery stations in the first quarter has doubled compared to the same period last year. At present, cooperative members are working together to carry out the collective construction of the cooperatives, strive for a bumper harvest of crops, and vigorously develop animal husbandry. The party organizations in the countryside are also being strengthened and developed, and many outstanding cooperative members have been admitted into the Party.
    The Hungarian working class also successfully completed the production plan for the first quarter, with an average daily output increase of 5% compared to the same period last year. The production of many important products has not only exceeded the level of the same period last year but has also exceeded the original plan. Coal production exceeded the plan by 3%, electricity increased by 9% compared to the same period last year, coke increased by 12%, pig iron increased by 3%, hot-rolled steel increased by 12%, aluminum increased by 23%, and nitrogen fertilizer increased by 138%. Domestic trade retail sales increased by 7% compared to the same period last year, exports increased by 15%, and imports increased by 3%. Residents' income increased by 5% compared to the same period last year.
    Since the Party Central Committee issued the call to accelerate socialist construction on March 6th, a labor competition to complete the main targets of the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule has been launched vigorously throughout the country. The workers of various factories and enterprises have been exerting their efforts, using their brains, and exploring production potential to improve the originally planned production and savings plans. The workers of the Chepel Power Plant saved nearly 1.8 million forints in a short period of time. The workers of the Icarus Bus Factory had promised to produce 20 more buses than planned by April 4th, but they fulfilled their promise ahead of schedule on March 21st.
    The technical innovation movement of the broad masses of Hungarian workers is also entering a new climax, and many factories and enterprises have established socialist labor teams.
    New atmospheres have also emerged in culture and education. Since the beginning of spring, many writers, artists, singers, and actors have gone deep into factories and rural areas to meet with workers and farmers, hold small concerts, literary evenings, and art exhibitions for workers and farmers, and let the working people directly offer their criticism of their creations.
    The resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Hungarian National Federation of Art Workers' Committee on April 8th stipulated that strengthening and expanding the close ties between artists and workers and farmers should be regarded as the most important task at present. The meeting also stipulated specific measures for artists to go deep into the masses and vigorously assist workers' and peasants' cultural activities. Many artists will go deep into the countryside for a long time to create.
    In education, comprehensive technical education has been further developed. Ideological education has also been greatly strengthened in universities. The Party and the government attach great importance to the enrollment and learning problems of working youth and children of workers and peasants. The worker-peasant revolutionary government recently passed a decree on the establishment of social scholarships to help working youth and children of workers and peasants to enroll in schools and study. Factories, enterprises, and farms can provide scholarships to train the working youth of their units. These young people will return to their original units to work after graduation. Schools are also taking specific measures to help working youth and children of workers and peasants complete their studies. (Attached picture)

    匈牙利加速社会主义建设的步伐
    农业合作化运动发展迅速　春耕春播又快又好
    广大职工展开竞赛争取提前一年完成三年计划
    本报布达佩斯28日电　1959年开春以来，英雄的匈牙利人民加速了社会主义建设的步伐，在工业、农业和文化方面接连取得辉煌成就。
    在农业方面，农业合作化运动迅速发展，春耕春播工作也得到了前所未有的成绩。从今年1月1日到3月底为止，匈牙利全国有三十万农户，带着近二百万霍尔特土地（每霍尔特合八点五五市亩）加入了农业合作社。各地已有40％的农村的农民全部入了社，发展快的州已完成了合作化。合作社和国营农场的耕地面积，从去年年底占全国耕地总面积的26.5％，增加到49％。现在全国有近四千五百个农业社，五十二万三千个社员。
    在全党全民的积极支持下而组织起来的农民，政治和生产热情空前高涨。今年春耕春播工作是最近几年来完成得最快最好的一年。合作社使用化肥量比去年增加了两倍多。农业机器站第一季度完成的工作比去年同时期增加了一倍。目前合作社员正在同心合力地进行社的集体建设，争取农作物的丰收，大力发展畜牧业。农村党的组织也在日益加强和发展，很多优秀的社员被吸收入了党。
    匈牙利工人阶级也胜利地完成了第一季度的生产计划，平均日产量比去年同时期增加了5％。很多重要产品的生产不仅超过了去年同时期的水平，而且超过了原定计划。煤超计划增产3％，电力比去年同时期增加9％，焦炭增加了12％，生铁增加3％，热轧钢12％，铝23％，氮肥增加了138％。国内贸易零售额比去年同时期增长了7％，出口增加15％，入口增加3％。居民的收入比去年同时期提高5％。
    自从3月6日党中央委员会发出加速社会主义建设的号召后，为提前一年完成三年计划主要指标的劳动竞赛，已在全国轰轰烈烈地普遍展开。各工厂企业的职工，都鼓足干劲，开动脑筋，发掘生产潜力，提高了原订的生产节约计划。切佩尔发电厂的职工们在短短的时间内就节约了近一百八十多万福林。伊卡鲁斯公共汽车厂的职工曾提出保证，到4月4日为止要超计划增产二十辆公共汽车，但他们的语言在3月21日便提前实现了。
    匈牙利广大职工技术革新运动目前也进入了新的高潮，很多工厂企业成立了社会主义劳动队。
    在文化教育方面也出现了新气象。开春以来很多作家、美术家、歌唱家和演员们深入工厂和农村，同工人和农民会见，为工人和农民举办小型音乐会、文艺晚会和美术展览会，让劳动人民直接对他们的创作提出批评意见。
    4月8日，匈牙利全国艺术工会委员会扩大会议的决议规定把加强和扩大艺术家同工人和农民的密切联系，当着目前最重要任务。会议并规定艺术家深入群众和大力辅助工农文化活动的具体措施。很多艺术家将长期地深入到农村去进行创作。
    在教育方面，综合技术教育得到了进一步的发展。在大学里也大大加强了思想教育。党和政府非常重视劳动青年和工农子弟的升学和学习问题，工农革命政府最近通过了关于设立社会助学金的法令，以帮助劳动青年和工农子弟就学和学习，各工厂企业和农庄可以提供助学金，培养本单位的劳动青年。这些青年毕业后仍回原单位工作。学校也正在采取具体措施，帮助劳动青年和工农子弟完成学习任务。（附图片）
