　　The Story of the "Bodhisattva Soldiers"
　　Xinhua News Agency Correspondent

　　Among the Tibetan people, many moving stories about the People's Liberation Army's love for the people are widely circulated. Tibetan compatriots affectionately call their beloved PLA soldiers "Bodhisattva Soldiers."

　　"Thank you, Chairman Mao! Thank you, People's Liberation Army!"

　　In the area where a certain PLA platoon is stationed, there is a child named Renqin Pingcuo, who is eleven years old this year, and his younger brother Suonan Pingcuo is only eight years old. Last year, the father of these two young brothers was forced into hard labor by the feudal serf owners and died from overwork. The soldiers, seeing how pitiful the two children were, went to their home to understand the situation. Their mother said sorrowfully, "My family rented a total of five 'ke' of land for seeds. The seeds were sown by his father himself. The highland barley hasn't ripened yet, and he passed away. Recently, the highland barley has ripened, and I'm worried that no one will harvest it. I'm so worried! I wonder who will help me solve my worries?"

　　After learning about the situation of this Tibetan orphan and widow family, the soldiers immediately decided to help this distressed family.

　　The next day, the rising sun had just illuminated the top of the West Mountain. A team to help with the harvest, led by the two young Tibetan brothers, Renqin Pingcuo and Suonan Pingcuo, marched into the highland barley field rented by their family. The soldiers slung their weapons over their shoulders and worked diligently in the highland barley field, some cutting, some bundling, some stacking, and some picking up the fallen highland barley ears. An hour passed, and the platoon leader blew the whistle for a break, but no one was willing to rest. Everyone was working with great enthusiasm.

　　After a while, the older sister-in-law brought highland barley wine, and then the little brother Renqin Pingcuo brought pea pods. Because the soldiers all knew that the older sister-in-law lacked food and wine, everyone refused to eat or drink, which made the older sister-in-law very anxious. Suonan Pingcuo and his brother insisted and pestered the platoon leader to order the soldiers to drink. Finally, the platoon leader represented all the soldiers and drank a bowl of highland barley wine and tasted a pea pod.

　　While harvesting, the soldiers sang, "The ice and snow on the high mountains can be melted by the sun, the dark clouds in the sky can be blown away by the wind, and the sorrows of the Tibetan people, our People's Liberation Army will untangle." After several hours of intense and joyful labor, when the soldiers returned to the barracks in uniforms soaked with sweat, the two little brothers waved their small hands and cheered repeatedly, "The Liberation Army solved my family's worries, thank you Liberation Army! Chairman Mao's troops solved my family's worries, thank you, Chairman Mao!"

　　Zaxi Dancuo Gets Saved

　　One snowy evening, a Tibetan couple, their hearts filled with sadness, brought their child, Zaxi Dancuo, who was not yet two years old, to the hospital of a certain PLA unit for medical treatment. The child was vomiting and having diarrhea, with convulsions in his limbs, a stiff neck, and protruding, rolling, and fixed eyeballs. His condition was extremely serious. The Tibetan couple cried incessantly, saying, "We are old and only have this one child left." The military doctors immediately examined him and diagnosed him with acute gastroenteritis.

　　Faced with the child's critical condition, everyone was extremely anxious. The hospital director said to the crying Tibetan couple, "Rescuing the dying and helping the injured, and helping Tibetan compatriots, is our responsibility. We will definitely do everything possible to save this child." So, the military doctors immediately injected the child with a cardiotonic, followed by oxygen through an oxygen cylinder, which initially improved the child's condition.

　　However, Zaxi Dancuo's dehydration was very severe, and he urgently needed a large amount of fluid replenishment. Because the two-year-old child was too dehydrated, it was impossible to find a vein. One military doctor suggested injecting into the bone marrow cavity, but they didn't have that kind of needle. They used a regular needle instead, but the needle was too small, and the infusion speed was slow, which couldn't meet the needs of the condition. Therefore, they performed subcutaneous infusion. From 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM, after rescue efforts, the child's vomiting disappeared. At midnight, Zaxi Dancuo suddenly cried out, calling "Ama" twice. Zaxi Dancuo's parents were so happy that they couldn't speak. The military doctors breathed a sigh of relief. To save this dying child, the PLA medical staff had put in so much hard work! Not only was there a consultation by military doctors, but also, due to the shortage of medicines and equipment, the medical staff repeatedly braved the dark and snowy night to climb mountains and ridges to obtain medical supplies and equipment from other places.

　　Although Zaxi Dancuo was out of danger, he was still passing purulent, mucous bloody stools, which threatened his life. The military hospital decided to have the child hospitalized for treatment, accompanied by his parents, completely free of charge. After five days and five nights of rescue and treatment, Zaxi Dancuo's health gradually recovered, and a smile appeared on his little face. Many Tibetan compatriots from the child's hometown came from afar to visit. Zaxi Dancuo's parents said to their fellow villagers with mixed feelings, "My previous three children got sick and didn't get well, and they all died. This remaining little one was seriously ill, but fortunately, we found the People's Liberation Army. This child was saved by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

　　When Zaxi Dancuo was discharged from the hospital, the hospital also gave him several children's toys. As he followed his parents out of the military hospital gate, he turned back from time to time, waving his little hand, and saying to the PLA uncles and aunts in Tibetan, "Thank you, goodbye!"

　　Risks Illness to Beat Off Vicious Dogs for Tibetans

　　One day, after dinner, the soldiers of a certain PLA platoon were running to the playground for various activities, which were very lively and energetic. Suddenly, they heard the barking of dogs in the area, mixed with the crying of a child, and someone shouting, "Beat the dog! Beat the dog!" All the soldiers of the platoon immediately rushed back, but the dogs had run away. They saw soldier Chen Yuanqing holding a twelve or thirteen-year-old Tibetan child, and an elderly Tibetan woman with tears in her eyes thanking Chen Yuanqing repeatedly. At that time, the soldiers were very surprised because Chen Yuanqing had been sick for several days and couldn't even get out of bed. How could he have run out? Everyone saw that Chen Yuanqing couldn't hold on any longer, so they quickly helped him back to his sickbed and sent away the frightened Tibetan child and elderly woman who lived in a neighboring village.

　　The origin of the matter was like this: when Chen Yuanqing was running a high fever, he suddenly heard a group of dogs barking outside the window, a child crying, and an old woman shouting. He thought that a group of dogs in the village must be biting the child. He called out a few times, but no one came, so he decided to help the child and the old woman. But as soon as he stood up, his legs went weak, and he lay down again. He called out again, "Beat the dog, beat the dog!" But still no one came. The child was screaming, and the old woman was crying. At this time, Chen Yuanqing thought that helping the Tibetan people was the responsibility of the People's Liberation Army. He forgot that he was seriously ill, and with one burst of energy, he jumped out of the window, grabbed a big stick, beat away seven or eight fierce dogs, and rescued the child. (Picture attached)

　　After a day's work, the military and civilians sat together to enjoy music.

    “菩萨兵”的故事
    新华社随军记者
    在西藏人民中，广泛流传着许多解放军动人的爱民故事。藏族同胞都把他们爱戴的解放军叫做“菩萨兵”。
    “谢谢毛主席！谢谢解放军！”
    驻在西藏人民解放军某排的驻地，有一个名叫仁钦凭错的小孩，今年十一岁，他的弟弟索南凭错才八岁。这两个小兄弟的父亲，在去年被封建农奴主强迫劳役，疲劳过度死去了。战士们看到两个小孩怪可怜的，就到他们的家中了解情况。他们的母亲悲怆地说：“我家一共租了五克种子的地，种子还是他爸爸亲手播种下去的，青稞还没有长熟，他就去世了。近来青稞熟了，我担心没人去收割，我愁呀，愁！我想谁会帮我解愁呢？”
    战士们了解了这个藏族孤儿寡妇家庭的情况后，立即决定帮助这个苦难的家庭。
    第二天，旭日刚刚照亮了西山顶。一支助民收割的队伍，就在仁钦凭错、索南凭错两个藏族小兄弟的引路下，开进他家租种的青稞地去了。战士们把武器往肩上一挎，在这片青稞地里，有的割，有的捆，有的堆，有的拾拣落到地上的青稞穗。一个小时过去了，排长吹哨子叫休息，但是没有一个肯休息的，真是一个比一个劲头大。
    一会儿大嫂子送来了青稞酒，一会儿仁钦凭错小弟弟送来了豌豆角。因为战士们都清楚大嫂缺粮、少酒，个个都不吃，人人都不喝，把大嫂子急出了一头大汗，索南凭错和他的哥哥也硬是不依，缠着排长要他命令战士们喝。后来终于由排长代表全体战士喝了一碗青稞酒，尝了一个豌豆角。
    战士们一面收割，一面唱着：“高山上的冰雪太阳能照化，天空中的乌云大风能吹散，藏族人民的愁苦，我们解放军要解开。”几个小时紧张愉快的劳动过去了，当战士们穿着被汗水浸透了的军装回营房时，小弟兄两人挥动着小手连声欢呼：“解放军给我家解了愁，谢谢解放军！毛主席的队伍给我家解了愁，谢谢毛主席！”扎喜旦错得救了　　在一个满天风雪的黄昏，一对心情充满了悲伤的藏族夫妇抱着他们不满两周岁的孩子扎喜旦错，到解放军某部医院求医。这孩子上吐下泻，四肢抽搐，颈部僵直，眼球突出翻转而固定，病情极端严重。这对藏族夫妇痛哭不止地说，“我们年老了，只剩下这一个孩子。”军医们立即检查，诊断结果患的是急性肠胃炎。　　面对孩子危急的病情，大家的心情万分焦急。医院院长对这对哭得死去活来的藏族夫妇说：“扶死救伤，帮助藏族同胞，是我们的责任，我们一定想尽一切办法救活这孩子。”于是，军医们马上给这孩子注射强心剂，跟着又用氧气筒输氧，使孩子的病情初步有点好转。　　可是，扎喜旦错的脱水情况很严重，急需大量补助液体。由于这两岁的孩子脱水过多，静脉找不到，一个军医主张骨髓腔内注入，但没有这种针头，他们就利用一般的针头代替，可是针头小了，输液速度慢，不能达到病情的需要，因此进行了皮下输入。从下午五时到夜里十时，经过抢救后，孩子的呕吐消失了，到午夜十二时，扎喜旦错突然哇的一声啼哭起来，叫了两声“阿妈”。扎喜旦错的父母高兴得说不出话来，军医们舒了一口气。为了救活这个垂死的孩子，解放军医护人员们付出了多么大的辛劳啊！不但由军医会诊，而且由于药品和器械不足，医护人员们还一再冒着黑夜的大风雪，爬山越岭到旁的地方去取医疗药械。
    扎喜旦错这孩子虽然脱离了险境，但还是拉脓粘液血便，威胁着他的生命。军医院决定让孩子由他的父母陪着住院治疗，并且完全免费。经过五天五夜的抢救和治疗，扎喜旦错的健康逐渐恢复了，小脸上出现了笑容。这孩子家乡的许多藏胞都远道赶来探望。扎喜旦错的父母对同乡们百感交集地说，“我以前的三个孩子生了病，都没有治好，都死去了。剩下的这个小娃生了重病，幸好找到了解放军，这孩子是共产党和毛主席救活的。”
    扎喜旦错出院的时候，医院还送给他几个儿童玩具。他跟着父母走出军医院的大门，不时回过头来招着小手，用藏语向解放军叔叔、阿姨们说着“谢谢，再见！”
    为藏民带病打恶狗
    解放军某排的战士们，有一天吃过晚饭后，全排战士跑向操场进行着各项活动，非常热烈活泼，忽然听到驻地群狗狂叫，夹杂着一个小孩的啼哭声，还有人喊着“打狗！打狗！”全排战士立刻赶回去的时候，狗都跑开了，只见战士陈元清抱着一个十二、三岁的藏族小孩，一位藏族老太太眼里噙着泪花，向陈元清连连道谢。当时战士们见了都很惊奇，因为陈元清已经病倒好几天了，床都起不来，他怎么能跑出来呢？大家看着陈元清支持不住了，赶紧扶着他回病床休息，并且把受惊的住在邻村的藏胞小孩和老太太送走。
    事情的来由是这样的，当陈元清正在发高烧的时候，忽然听到窗外一群狗在狂吠，小孩在哭，一个老大娘在嚷，他想一定是村里的一群狗在咬小孩，他呼叫了几声，没有一个人来，就决心帮助小孩和老大娘一下。可是他刚刚站起来，腿一软又躺下去了。他又叫了几声“打狗，打狗！”仍不见人来，小孩在狂叫，老大娘在哭。这时，陈元清想到帮助西藏人民是解放军的责任，他忘了自己是重病号，一鼓作气地从窗口跳了出来，提着一条大棒把七、八只凶恶的狗打跑了，把小孩救出来。（附图片）
    一天的劳动完了之后，军民围坐在一起欣赏音乐。
