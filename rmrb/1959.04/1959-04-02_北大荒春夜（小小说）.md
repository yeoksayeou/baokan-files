    Spring Night in Beida荒 (Short Story)
    Xiao Yingjun
    After work in the afternoon, Wang Hao bought some food from the cooperative and brought back two portions of food from the kitchen to his home. Now he was acting like a stage artist, moving the suitcase and small table here and there; pasting a "Carp Leaping Over Dragon Gate" New Year picture on the wall, and hanging a sky-blue curtain on the window. Then, he looked at this simple room for a long time until he felt satisfied, then washed his face and changed into clean clothes.
    This was not an ordinary day! His lover, from whom he had been separated for five years, was arriving here tonight from the distant south. Wang Hao felt a little excited, he sat silently by the window, recalling the face of his lover whom he had left only half a month after their marriage, thinking about what he should say to her after they met.
    It was getting dark, and the wind was howling outside. Although it had been a long time since the beginning of spring, the spring night in Beida荒 still carried a bit of chill. At this moment, a burst of whistles sounded outside the house, and the team transporting fertilizer overnight, carrying dirt baskets, pulling sledges, and yelling at ox carts, went towards the fields.
    In an instant, the village was extremely quiet. The houses were all locked, and the windows were dark with no lights.
    Wang Hao suddenly felt a little lonely. He was originally going to participate in the fertilizer accumulation; however, the instructor ordered him to stay and wait for his lover. Now he thought of the field's assigned task of transporting 5,000 tons of fertilizer in five days, and he couldn't help but feel anxious.
    It was very dark outside, and the wind was still blowing hard. He thought: She probably won't come tonight! But, what if she comes? He was a little embarrassed. After a long time, he couldn't help it, and resolutely turned on the electric light, leaving the door unlocked, so that she could rest alone when she arrived.
    So, Wang Hao left a note on the table, kept the food warm next to the stove, and pulled his self-made sledge, heading towards the fields.
    As soon as he walked out of the village, he saw long dragons of flashlight lights shining in the field. Everywhere he heard voices and laughter, and some people were humming songs, whistling, very lively! As soon as Wang Hao saw this scene, he immediately forgot everything. He led the sledge and ran quickly to the fertilizer pile.
    The night was very deep, and the roosters in the nearby villages crowed for the first time. The instructor blew the whistle for the third time, calling everyone to go back to rest, but no one went back. On the road transporting fertilizer, people and horses were still coming and going in an endless stream, and if one wasn't careful, they would run into the people coming from the opposite direction.
    Every time he sent fertilizer back, a woman would load the sledge for him. Although he couldn't see who she was in the dark, judging from the speed at which she loaded the sledge, she must be an experienced labor model. Wang Hao couldn't help but ask: "Comrade, which group are you from?"
      "I'm not from any group," the woman replied.
      "Then you just arrived."
      "Yes, I just arrived not long ago."
      "Ah, you are indeed a good hand."
      "I see you are also pulling a lot and fast."
    The roosters crowed for the third time. On the fertilizer transportation site, it was still in full swing. Wang Hao pulled a sledge of manure and was about to leave when suddenly the woman who had just loaded the sledge called him again: "Comrade! Do you know where Wang Hao lives?"
      "What do you want him for?" Wang Hao said.
    "I am his lover."
    Wang Hao was stunned, he threw away the hemp rope on his shoulder and walked towards her.
      "Ah! Are you Yulan?"
      "Hey! Are you Wang Hao? I almost couldn't recognize your voice." Yulan said excitedly and affectionately.
      "How come, your accent has completely changed?" Wang Hao asked in surprise.
      "Oh! We all learn Mandarin at home and don't speak the old local dialect anymore."
      "How did you get here?"
      "When I arrived at your team, there wasn't a single person inside or outside. I saw it was very lively here, so I came."
    "You must be tired from the journey! Go back and rest."
      "I won't, I'll wait until dawn to go back with the comrades."
    The sky slowly brightened, and with the first rays of dawn, Wang Hao saw his lover's face clearly. She was still as young, beautiful, and strong as she was five years ago. The half of the red sun that had just emerged from the mountain peak cast a red glow on her face. She stood facing the wind, so much like a winter jasmine blossoming from the fertile soil of Beida荒!

    北大荒春夜（小小说）
    萧英俊
    下午收工后，王浩到合作社买了些吃的东西，从伙房打回了两个人的饭，回到家里。现在他正像个舞台美术工作者似的，把皮箱、小桌搬到这里，又搬到那边；往墙上贴了一张“鲤鱼跃龙门”的年画，在窗上挂上一块天蓝色的窗帘。然后，他久久地端详着这间简单的房间，直到自己认为满意了，才洗了个脸，换上一身干干净净的衣服。
    这不是个平常的日子啊！他的离别了五年的爱人，从千里迢迢的南方，今晚就要到达这里了。王浩的心里有些激动，他默默地坐在窗边，回想着刚结了婚半个月就离开了的爱人的面貌，想着见面后该向她说些什么话。
    天快黑了，外边呼呼地刮着风。虽然已经立春好久了，可是北大荒的春夜，还是带着几分寒意。这时，屋外响起了一阵哨声，连夜运肥的队伍，挑着土筐、拉着爬犁、吆喝着牛车朝地里走去了。
    一霎时，村子里安静极了。一座座的房子都锁着门，窗户都黑洞洞的没有灯光。
    王浩突然感到有些寂寞。他本来也要去参加积肥的；可是指导员命令他非留下等爱人不可。现在他想起场里分配的五天运肥五千吨的任务，心里不免着急起来。
    外边天很黑，风还刮得很猛。他想：今晚她不会来了吧！可是，万一来了呢？他有些为难。又过了很久，他实在忍不住了，决然把电灯开着，不锁门，让她来了先一个人休息着。
    于是，王浩在桌上留了个字条，把饭放在炉子旁边热着，便拉着他自造的爬犁，朝地里走去。
    刚走出村子，就见地里亮着长龙般的手电光。到处听到话声和笑声，还有人哼着歌、吹着口哨、热火极啦！王浩一见这情景，顿时把什么都忘了。他牵着爬犁、飞快地向肥堆奔去。
    夜很深了，附近村子里的雄鸡头一遍打鸣了。指导员第三次吹哨子叫大家回去休息，可是谁也没有回去。运肥的路上，人马仍旧络绎不绝，只要一不小心，就会和对面来的人撞个满怀。
    他每次送肥回来，都有一个妇女给他装犁。虽然黑夜里看不清她是谁，可是，从她装犁的速度看来，定是一个老练的劳动能手。王浩不禁问道：“同志，你是哪个组的？”
      “我哪个组也不是。”那妇女答道。
      “那么，你是才来的。”
      “对，才来了不久。”
      “啊，你倒是把好手。”
      “我看你也拉得又多又快呀。”
    雄鸡第三遍叫了。运肥工地上，仍旧热火朝天。王浩拉了一爬犁粪正想走，忽然刚才那个女同志又在叫他：“同志！你知道王浩住在哪儿吗？”
      “你找他有什么事？”王浩说。
    “我是他爱人。”
    王浩猛一楞，他甩开肩上的麻绳，朝她走去。
      “啊！你是玉兰？”
      “嗨！你就是王浩呀？看我的耳朵，都听不出来了。”玉兰激动而深情地说。
      “怎
        么，你的口音全变啦？”王浩惊奇地问。
      “哦！我们在家都学普通话，不讲老土话啦。”
      “你怎么到这里来了呢？”
      “到你们队里一看呀，里里外外半个人影也没有。我一瞧这里很热闹，就来了呗。”
    “路上累了吧！快回去歇着去。”
      “我才不呢，等天亮和同志们一块儿回去。”
    天慢慢地亮了，借着第一线曙光，王浩看清了自己爱人的脸。她依旧同五年前一样年轻、秀美、健壮。刚冒出山头的半边红日，把红光镀在她的脸上。她迎风站着，多么像一朵从北大荒的沃土里绽开的迎春花啊！
