    High Enthusiasm, Implementation of Measures
    Representative Zhou Jianren Discusses Launching a Large-Scale High-Yield Early Rice Campaign

    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and other reports.

    The British imperialists and Indian expansionists are colluding and acting in collusion to instigate the former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary groups to betray the motherland and carry out armed rebellion. This blatant interference in our country's internal affairs and undermining of our country's unity is bound to fail. Recently, our People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, with the support of the Tibetan people, quickly quelled the rebellion. I express my heartfelt support for this. Tibet will always be China's Tibet, and no foreign interference in China's internal affairs will be permitted!

    Now, I will report to the representatives on the current situation of launching the double-thousand jin early rice movement in Zhejiang Province:

    Zhejiang is currently in the midst of the intense early rice transplanting season. Rural work cadres and the masses are exerting themselves to strive for advancement and achieve even greater leaps forward in early rice this year than last year. Last year, the average yield of early rice in the province was about 800 jin per mu. This year, not only should this figure be exceeded, but efforts should also be made to achieve a large area of early rice yields of over 2,000 jin per mu. Achieving this task is quite arduous, but judging from the preparatory work, this year's conditions are better than last year's. This year's sowing time is generally about half a month earlier than last year's, and the sowing amount is about 35 jin per mu on average. Improved varieties have also been popularized. Fertilizer accumulation started earlier than last year, with an average of about 150 dan of standard fertilizer per mu. In terms of dense planting, last year an average of more than 20,000 clumps of rice were transplanted per mu, and this year's transplants have already reached about 40,000 to 60,000 clumps. In particular, after last year's Great Leap Forward, cadres and the masses have accumulated rich harvest experience. The people's communes, after rectification, will also play a greater role. As long as the people of the province continue to exert themselves, strive for advancement, and conscientiously implement the established measures, and in the absence of unexpected natural disasters, achieving a greater leap forward is entirely possible.

    In carrying out the double-thousand jin early rice movement, in addition to continuously promoting the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, special attention is also paid to the implementation of targets and measures. That is to say, in the double-thousand jin early rice movement, all tasks and methods must be fully discussed by the masses, and must become the tasks and methods of the masses. This is to make them conform to reality, make the movement a conscious movement of the masses, and achieve the implementation of ideology, the implementation of targets, and the implementation of measures. Last year's practice proved that if these aspects cannot be implemented, a greater leap forward will fail.

    In order to achieve implementation, people's communes throughout the province have launched mass debates on this year's early rice targets and measures. The main issues of the debate are: Can early rice achieve a greater leap forward? Can a large area of 2,000 jin per mu be achieved? Is it determination plus hard work, or is it talking about doing it but actually not intending to complete it? From the situation of the debate, it seems that the key to people's confidence in a greater leap forward lies in whether they can correctly accept the experience of last year's great leap forward in agricultural production. Some people believe that last year's efforts were exhausted and the potential was exhausted. They believe that the high-yield achievements of last year are just typical examples and are accidental. They particularly emphasize certain shortcomings of last year, so there can be no more great leaps forward this year. However, most people disagree with this view. They believe that high-yield fields with early rice yields of 1,500 jin and more than 2,000 jin per mu were everywhere last year (530,000 mu, accounting for about 3%), which is precisely the model for our struggle this year. In these high-yield fields, there are still many loopholes in the work. As long as we learn from last year's experience and overcome last year's shortcomings, it is entirely possible to achieve a greater leap forward. In the great debate in Qushan Commune, Zhoushan County, the methods of comparing output, comparing high and low, exploring potential, and finding loopholes were adopted to summarize the experience of early rice production of 2,000 jin per mu last year. At the same time, it was found that there were still many loopholes in these high-yield fields, mainly: 1. Insufficient seeds were sown, initially only 12 jin per mu, and three times later. The seedlings were not strong enough, delaying the sowing season. 2. There were fewer improved varieties. 3. The plowing was not deep or meticulous, with a depth of only five or six inches. 4. Improper fertilization, insufficient base fertilizer in the early stage, and excessive nitrogen fertilizer in the later stage, causing lodging. 5. The planting density was not enough, generally only more than 20,000 clumps, and some were too dense (more than 100,000 clumps). 6. Some rice fields suffered from drought in the later stage. These loopholes are generally representative in the province. After summarizing experience and launching debates, the confidence of the masses has been greatly improved. They said: Last year's experience is a mirror. As long as we learn from experience and make up for the loopholes, this year's early rice yield can be greatly increased.

    When discussing specific targets and measures, the leadership grasped both boosting enthusiasm and leaving room for maneuver. When determining planned targets, those with conditions to reach 2,000 jin per mu should strive to achieve it. Those without sufficient conditions should also discuss with the masses, set high-yield targets that can be achieved through efforts, and formulate corresponding measures according to these high-yield targets to ensure that they are achieved without fail. When determining output contracts, room should be left for the masses, and the output contracts should be about 30% lower than the actual possible yield, so that production teams and commune members feel that there is a great possibility of overproduction, so as to better mobilize their enthusiasm. However, some cadres only start from some one-sided reasons such as ensuring the realization of planned targets and ensuring more accumulation for the commune. They believe that a lower output contract is a "wavering" and "discouragement" of the Great Leap Forward. They do not understand that an output contract that is appropriately lower than the planned target will not only not affect the national plan and the accumulation of the commune, but on the contrary, due to the increased enthusiasm of the masses, the national plan and the commune's accumulation are even more guaranteed. After airing views and debates, the tendency of excessively high output contracts was overcome, and the output contract targets for early rice in various places in the province were generally around 600 jin to 1,000 jin per mu. The same is true in formulating production increase measures. Any advanced measures must be adapted to the local soil, varieties, and technical conditions, and cannot be uniform. According to last year's experience, a general planting density of 50,000 to 60,000 clumps per mu is appropriate for rice. However, conditions vary from place to place, and some places have not yet gained experience in this type of dense planting. Therefore, the planting density standard we proposed is generally 40,000 to 60,000 clumps per mu. In the specific implementation, all localities have undergone full debate by the masses and made regulations in accordance with local conditions. For those output contracts that were originally too high and measures that were unrealistic, they were also revised according to the opinions of the majority of the masses. In order to ensure the realization of these targets and measures, various localities have also continued to promote the system of contracted output, contracted labor, and contracted costs, and have specifically defined crop varieties, output targets, production increase measures, and management responsibilities to the fields, and implemented the collective and individual responsibility system. In this way, the targets and measures can be further implemented.

    After the targets and measures are determined, the masses believe that the most difficult problem at present is the shortage of labor. Therefore, to ensure the implementation of the plan, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to do everything possible to improve labor productivity. Taking the current situation of transplanting as an example, the requirements for planting density, deep plowing and fine cultivation, and fertilizer accumulation and transportation have been improved compared to the past. Especially in April, the labor force is generally felt to be more strained. If labor efficiency cannot be increased by half or even doubled, there is a danger of delaying the season. In order to solve this problem, various localities in the province have launched technical training and high-efficiency movements. At present, more than 2.5 million transplanters and various agricultural implement handlers have been trained throughout the province. Special districts and counties have convened "on-site skill comparison" conferences to exchange experiences in technical innovation. Various localities have also focused on improving agricultural implements and promoting advanced agricultural implements, improving labor organization, and carrying out labor competitions, and have achieved great results. The most prominent issue in current transplanting is the improvement of operational techniques. Huangyan County took the lead in launching a study of the "Seven Fairies" high-speed transplanting movement. These seven women already transplanted more than 60,000 to 70,000 clumps per day last year, exceeding the experienced old transplanters in the area. Before the "March 8th" Women's Day this year, Huangyan County held a transplanting skill competition. All ten people's communes in the county selected a large number of transplanting experts to participate in the competition. Nine counties and one city in the Wenzhou Special District, Qu County in the Jinhua Special District, and Haining County in the Jiaxing Special District sent transplanting experts to participate in the conference to compete and learn from each other. As a result, Xu Meixiang, Wang Xianfeng, and Wang Meiyun of the "Seven Fairies" ranked among the top three in the women's transplanting competition. After this competition, the Wenzhou Special District used newspapers, radio, on-site meetings, and skill comparison meetings to launch a "Learn from the Seven Fairies, Catch up with the Seven Fairies, Surpass the Seven Fairies" movement throughout the district, and focused on transplanting to carry out a competition aimed at improving agricultural labor productivity. As a result, a large number of transplanting experts emerged in various counties. In Qing County, the "Ten Sisters" appeared, in Yongjia County, the "Seven Heroes" and "Seven Girls" appeared, and in Huangyan County, the "Hundred Heroines" and "Seventy-two Female Generals" appeared. Jiaxing Prefecture also held a regional youth and women's transplanting skill competition, and selected six "champions" and ten fast transplanting experts as pacesetters, launching a "transplant 60,000 clumps a day" high-efficiency competition. This movement has been launched throughout the province. The Provincial Communist Youth League Committee and the Provincial Women's Federation are currently organizing a "300,000 Transplanting Experts" movement among young people and women throughout the province. Through this movement, not only have a large number of production experts been cultivated, but also many good experiences have been summarized. For example, the "Five Tips for Transplanting" and "Cross Sutra" are all warmly welcomed by the masses. It can be seen that in the current situation, the potential to improve labor productivity through improving operational techniques is still very large. The same job can differ in labor efficiency by a factor of one, several, or even ten times depending on the level of technical proficiency. If the operational technical level of advanced producers can be earnestly promoted through technical training, labor competitions, and other methods, agricultural labor productivity will increase exponentially, and "learning from the advanced, learning technology" can also become a social trend. Overcome the difficulty of labor shortage.

    In order to strive for a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year, in addition to the above-mentioned targets and measures that must be implemented, it is more important that the work style of cadres must be more pragmatic. In carrying out the double-thousand jin early rice movement, we have repeatedly educated cadres at all levels: We must adhere to the mass line working method. Regardless of the targets or measures, we must ensure that the masses discuss them, listen to different opinions from all aspects, put forward opposing views, put forward several different methods, let the masses analyze, compare, and launch debates, and then make decisions based on the opinions of the majority. Of course, it is better to reach a consensus in the debate. If a few people insist on their own opinions, they should also be allowed to retain them and organize them to conduct experiments. Absolutely no coercive measures can be taken against the masses, or a frame can be stipulated and rigidly applied. Production is the masses' own business. If the masses are unwilling to do it, forcing them to do it, they will naturally not have enthusiasm. Without the enthusiasm of the masses, nothing can be done well. In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, leading cadres of counties and communes throughout the province regularly participate in physical labor in batches in accordance with the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on cadres participating in physical labor. In this way, we can gain an in-depth understanding of the urgent needs of the masses, care about the lives of the masses, and make the tasks and requirements put forward by the leadership more realistic. As long as we adhere to this mass line work style, we will be more guaranteed to strive for a greater leap forward in agricultural production.

    干劲冲天　措施落实
    周建人代表谈开展早稻大面积高产运动
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和其他各项报告。
    英帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子们互相勾结，狼狈为奸，策动原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团背叛祖国，进行武装叛乱，这种公然干涉我国内政、破坏我国统一的阴谋，肯定是要失败的。最近，我驻藏人民解放军，在西藏人民的支援下，迅速平定了叛乱，对此，我表示衷心的拥护。西藏永远是中国的西藏，中国内政决不允许任何外国干涉！
    现在，我将浙江省当前开展早稻双千斤运动问题，向各位代表作一汇报：
    目前浙江正处在紧张的早稻插秧季节，农村工作干部和群众正在鼓足干劲，力争上游，争取今年早稻比去年实现更大的跃进。去年全省早稻平均亩产八百斤左右，今年不但要超过这个数字，还要争取出现大面积的早稻亩产二千斤以上。实现这个任务是相当艰巨的，但是，从准备工作来看，今年的条件都比去年好。今年播种时间普遍比去年提早半个月左右，播种量每亩平均有三十五斤左右，优良品种也普及了；积肥开展得比去年早，每亩平均有一百五十担左右的标准肥；在密植方面，去年每亩平均插秧二万多丛，今年已经插下去的，都在四到六万丛左右。特别是经过去年的大跃进，干部和群众都积累了丰产经验；人民公社经过整顿，也将会发挥更大的优越性。只要全省人民，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，踏踏实实的将既定措施实现，在没有意外的自然灾害的情况下，实现更大跃进是完全可能的。
    在开展早稻双千斤运动中，除了不断发扬广大群众的革命干劲以外，还特别注重指标和措施的落实问题。这就是要求在早稻双千斤运动中，一切任务、办法，都一定要经过群众充分讨论，一定要把任务、办法成为群众的任务、办法。使之符合实际，使这个运动成为群众的自觉运动，做到思想落实，指标落实，措施也落实。去年的实践证明，这些方面如果不能落实，更大跃进就会落空。
    为了做到落实，全省人民公社对于今年早稻的指标和措施都展开了群众性的大辩论。辩论的主要问题是：早稻能不能实现更大的跃进？能不能出现大面积的亩产二千斤？是决心加上实干，还是口头说干实际上不打算完成？从辩论的情况看来，人们对于更大跃进有没有信心，关键在于能否正确接受去年农业生产大跃进的经验。有些人认为，去年的力气费尽了，潜力挖光了。他们认为去年那些高产的事迹，不过是典型，是偶然的。他们特别强调去年某些缺点，因而今年不能再大跃进了。但是多数人不同意这种意见，他们认为：去年早稻亩产一千五百斤、二千斤以上的高产田到处都有（全省有五十三万亩，占百分之三左右），这正是我们今年奋斗的榜样。在这些高产田当中，工作中还有很多漏洞。今年只要吸取去年的经验，克服去年的缺点，实现更大跃进是完全可能的。舟山县衢山公社在大辩论中，采取了摆产量、比高低、挖潜力、找漏洞的方法，总结了去年早稻亩产二千斤的经验，同时也发现这些丰产田还有不少漏洞，主要是：一、种子播得不足，开始每亩只有十二斤，后来补了三次，秧苗不够茁壮，拖长了播种季节。二、优良品种较少。三、耕得不深不细，深度只有五、六寸左右。四、施肥不当，前期基肥不足，后期氮肥过多，引起倒伏。五、密植程度不够，一般只有二万多丛，个别的又太密（十万丛以上）。六、有的稻田后期受旱。这些漏洞在全省来说，是带有普遍性的。群众经过总结经验，展开辩论，信心大大提高了。他们说：去年的经验是一面镜子，只要学了经验，补了漏洞，今年早稻产量一定可以大大提高。
    在讨论具体指标和措施时，领导上掌握了既鼓干劲，又留余地。在确定计划指标时，凡是有条件达到亩产二千斤的，应当努力争取实现，条件不足的也应当经过群众讨论，订出经过努力可能达到的高产指标，并且要按照这种高产指标订出相适应的措施，保证不折不扣地做到。在确定包产指标的时候，要给群众留有余地，包产指标要比实际可能达到的产量低百分之三十左右，使得生产小队和社员群众感到大有超产的可能，以便更好地发挥他们的积极性。但也有些干部只从保证实现计划指标、保证公社多提积累等一些片面的理由出发，认为包产指标低了，就是对大跃进的“动摇”和“泄气”。他们不了解包产指标适当低于计划指标，不但不会影响国家计划和公社的积累，相反，由于群众的积极性提高了，使得国家计划和公社积累更加有了保证。经过鸣放辩论，克服了这种包产过高的偏向，全省各地早稻的包产指标一般都在亩产六百斤至一千斤左右。在制订增产措施方面，也是如此。采取任何先进措施都必须和当地的土质、品种和技术条件相适应，而不能千篇一律。根据去年的经验，水稻密植一般以五万丛到六万丛为宜。但是各地条件不同，有些地方还没有取得这种密植的经验。因此，我们提出的密植标准，一般是每亩四万丛到六万丛，各地在具体执行中，都经过群众充分的辩论，按照当地条件，做出规定。对于原来包产指标过高、措施不切实际的，也根据多数群众意见作了修正。为了保证实现这些指标和措施，各地还继续推行了包产、包工、包成本的制度，并且把作物品种、产量指标、增产措施、管理责任都具体定到田，实行集体和个人的责任制。这样，就可以使指标和措施更加落实。
    在指标、措施确定之后，群众认为当前最困难的问题，是劳动力不足的问题。因此要保证计划的落实，还必须发动群众，千方百计，提高劳动生产率。拿目前插秧的情况来说，不论在密植程度、深耕细作、积肥运肥等方面，要求都比过去提高了，特别在四月份，劳动力更普遍感到紧张。如果不能把劳动效率提高半倍到一倍，就有耽误季节的危险。为了解决这个问题，全省各地都已开展了技术训练和高工效运动。目前全省已经训练了插秧手和各种农具手二百五十多万人，各专区、县都召开了“现场比巧”大会，交流技术革新的经验；各地还抓住了改良农具和推广先进农具、改善劳动组织、开展劳动竞赛，而且都获得了很大的效果。当前插秧中最突出的是改进操作技术问题。黄岩县首先开展了学习“七仙女”高速插秧运动。这七个妇女，去年的插秧速度已经达到每天插六、七万丛以上，超过了当地有经验的老插秧手。今年“三八”节前夕，黄岩县举行了插秧比巧大会。全县十个人民公社都选拔了大批插秧能手参加比赛。温州专区九县、一市，金华专区的衢县，嘉兴专区的海宁县都选派出插秧能手参加大会，互比高低，互相观摩。结果，“七仙女”中的许梅香、王仙凤、王美云名列妇女插秧比赛的前三名。这次比赛以后，温州专区就通过报纸，广播，现场会，比巧会，在全区范围内掀起了“学七仙女，赶七仙女，超七仙女”运动，并以插秧为重点，开展了以提高农业劳动生产率为目的的竞赛。结果，各县都涌现大批的插秧能手，在青田县出现了“十姐妹”，在永嘉县出现了“七英雄”、“七姑娘”，在黄岩出现了“百女英雄”、“七十二女将”等。嘉兴地区也举行了全区青年、妇女插秧比巧大会，评出六名“状元”，十名快速插秧能手，作为标兵，发起了“日插六万丛”高工效竞赛。这个运动，已在全省开展起来了。共青团省委和省妇联目前正在全省青年、妇女中组织“三十万名插秧能手”的运动。通过这个运动不仅培养出大批的生产能手，而且总结了许多很好的经验，象“插秧五窍诀”、“十字经”等，都受到群众的热烈欢迎。由此可见，在目前情况下，通过改进操作技术来提高劳动生产率的潜力，还是很大的。同样的工种，由于技术熟练程度不同，劳动效率的高低可以相差一倍、几倍甚至十几倍。如果能够把先进生产者的操作技术水平，通过技术训练，劳动竞赛等方式，认真地加以推广，农业的劳动生产率将会成倍地增长，“学先进，学技术”也能成为一种社会风气。克服劳动力不足的困难。
    争取今年农业生产的更大跃进，除了以上所说的指标、措施必须落实以外，更重要的是干部的工作作风必须更加踏实。我们在开展早稻双千斤运动中，反复地教育各级干部：必须坚持群众路线的工作方法，不论是指标、措施，都要确实让群众讨论，听取各方面不同的意见，提出对立面，提出几种不同的办法，让群众分析、比较，展开辩论，然后根据大多数人的意见作出决定。在辩论中，能够得出一个一致的意见当然更好，如果有少数人坚持自己的意见也应当允许他们保留，并且组织他们进行试验，绝对不可以对群众采取压服的手段，或者规定一个框子硬搬硬套下去。生产是群众自己的事情，如果群众不愿意办，硬要他办，他自然是不会有积极性的，而没有群众的积极性，什么事情也是办不好的。为了发挥群众的积极性，全省各县和公社的领导干部都按照中共中央和国务院关于干部参加体力劳动的指示，定期分批地参加劳动。这样，就能深入了解群众的迫切要求，关心群众的生活，并且使领导上所提出的任务要求能够切合实际。只要我们坚持这一套群众路线的工作作风，争取农业生产的更大跃进，就更有保证。
