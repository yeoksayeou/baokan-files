(Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 1st) The national coal transportation red banner station—Fuxin Station, "Vigorously Promote Collaboration Between Road and Mine as One Family, Ten Unifications with the Secretary Taking Charge," has achieved great success. In February, the average turnaround time at Fuxin Station was shortened to 5 hours and 58 minutes, more than half the time compared to the same period last year; a reduction of 2.14 hours compared to January of this year, which is equivalent to saving the country more than 1,500 freight cars for the whole month. In the first 24 days of March, the turnaround time at Fuxin Station remained below six hours, ensuring that the loading volume in March exceeded the Great Leap Forward plan. Liaoning Province has promoted Fuxin's experience throughout the province. Last month, it transported 1.14 million tons more goods than in January. Now, the road and mine workers at Fuxin Station have been awarded the national transportation red flag by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Coal Industry.

Fuxin Station and the mining area's effort to gain vehicles from time emerged under the situation of the all-round Great Leap Forward taking steel as the key link. Last year, in order to ensure the "marshal of steel" took command, Fuxin Coal Mine launched a massive coal production campaign, and coal production increased sharply. However, due to the lagging railway transportation work, the shortage of vehicles, and the long dwell time, a large amount of coal could not be loaded and transported in time, which affected the support for steel production and hindered the high yield of coal. In view of this situation, the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China launched a high-yield movement for railway transportation workers, so that the turnaround time of an empty car from arrival at the station to loading full of coal and departure was rapidly compressed from more than 14 hours to 7 or 8 hours, and once created the shortest turnaround time record of 4 hours and 12 minutes among the large stations nationwide that load and unload more than 700 cars per day.

The Great Leap Forward in transportation work in Fuxin proves that vigorously carrying out communist collaboration is an indispensable and important link in doing a good job in industrial production and transportation. The Great Leap Forward in transportation work in Fuxin is the result of the great collaboration between the railway system and the coal mine system, merging the relevant institutions, and implementing institutional reforms. In the past, the road and mine transportation departments, which jointly undertook the task of loading and transporting coal, did not work in a coordinated manner, which seriously hindered the exertion of transportation potential. Later, under the unified leadership of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the road and mine sides overcame departmentalism, strengthened collaboration, and merged the Xifuxin Station and the transportation section of the Fuxin Mining Bureau into the Fuxin Station, abolished the old rules and regulations that were not conducive to collaboration, and established the "Ten Unifications" new rules and regulations (namely, unified thinking, unified leadership, unified institutions, unified planning, unified dispatch, unified equipment, unified shifts, unified fighting goals, unified production, transportation and sales, and unified inspection and summary), strengthened transportation organization work, and reformed the transportation technical operation process, which greatly improved transportation efficiency.

The experience of the Great Leap Forward in transportation work in Fuxin also proves that leading cadres grasping transportation and personally participating in labor will surely promote the mass movement to bear fruitful results. At the beginning of the Fuxin transportation high-yield movement, the first secretary of the Municipal Party Committee personally took charge, and organized each mine (factory) to select a Party Committee secretary or mine (factory) director to focus on transportation work. They worked with the workers to load cars, unload cars, weigh, put coal on, and add water in the posture of ordinary laborers, and at the same time, timely summarized the experience created by the masses and pushed the movement forward. In the early stage of the movement, when there was insufficient manpower for loading cars, they mobilized the cadres of municipal organs, family members of workers and staff, and street residents to form a loading army of thousands of people, and quickly loaded and transported a large amount of accumulated "landed coal". After the in-depth development of the movement, they vigorously organized the vast number of workers in various links such as loading, transportation, and unloading, and launched a red flag competition centered on reforming transportation organization work and transportation technical operation processes, mobilized the masses to improve the level of transportation organization work, and made a revolution in the transportation technical operation process, so that new achievements continued to emerge in Fuxin's transportation work, and it was consolidated at a high-yield level for a long time. Now, all the workers and staff of Fuxin Station have put forward a proposal to the national loading and unloading workers to launch a red flag competition, and are fighting with soaring enthusiasm to create greater achievements.

### 路矿大协作运输插红旗  阜新车站货车装的快、卸的快、运的快

    路矿大协作运输插红旗
    阜新车站货车装的快、卸的快、运的快
    本报沈阳1日电　全国煤炭运输红旗车站——阜新车站“大搞协作路矿一家、十大统一书记亲抓”，“快装快卸快运，赛时间要车辆”，取得了很大的成绩。阜新车站2月份平均一次作业时间已缩短到五时五十八分，比去年同期缩短一半还多；比今年1月份缩短二点一四小时，全月相当于给国家节省了一千五百多辆货车。3月份前二十四天，阜新站一次作业时间仍在六小时以下，确保3月份装车量超过跃进计划。辽宁全省推广了阜新的经验，上月份就比1月份多运了一百一十四万吨货物。现在，阜新车站路矿职工，已获得中央铁道部、煤炭部奖给的全国运输红旗。
    阜新车站和矿区向时间要车是在以钢为纲全面大跃进的形势下出现的。去年阜新煤矿为了保证钢铁元帅升帐，掀起声势浩大的煤炭高产运动，煤炭产量激增。但因铁路运输工作跟不上，车辆少、停留时间长，大量煤炭不能及时装运出去，影响了支援钢铁生产，也阻碍了煤炭的高产。根据这种情况，中共阜新市委便发动铁路运输职工开展高产运动，使一列空车从到达车站到装满煤炭发出的一次作业时间，从原来的十四小时以上迅速压缩到七、八小时，并曾经以四小时十二分的成绩，在全国每日装卸七百车以上的大站中，创造一次作业时间最短的记录。
    阜新运输工作大跃进证明，大搞共产主义协作是搞好工业生产和交通运输不可缺少的重要一环。阜新运输工作的大跃进是铁路系统和煤矿系统大协作，把有关的机构合并，实行体制上的改革的结果。过去，共同担负装运煤炭任务的路矿运输部门，工作得很不协调，严重地妨碍着运输潜力的发挥。后来中共阜新市委统一领导，路矿双方克服本位主义，加强协作，把西阜新车站和阜新矿务局运输部的车务段合并成阜新车站，废除不利于协作的旧规章制度，建立了“十大统一”的新规章制度（即思想统一、领导统一、机构统一、计划统一、调度统一、设备统一、班次统一、奋斗目标统一、产运销统一、检查总结统一），加强运输组织工作，改革运输技术作业过程，大大提高了运输效率。
    阜新运输工作大跃进的经验也证明，领导干部抓紧交通运输和亲自参加劳动，必会促进群众运动结出丰硕的果实。阜新运输高产运动一开始，中共市委第一书记就亲自挂帅，并组织各矿（厂）抽出一名党委书记或矿（厂）长专抓运输工作。他们以普通劳动者姿态和工人一起装车、卸车、检斤、上煤、上水，同时及时总结群众创造的经验，把运动推向前进。在运动初期装车人力不足时，便发动全市机关干部、职工家属、街道居民组成一支数千人的装车大军，很快就把大量积存的“落地煤”装运出去。运动深入开展后，又大力组织装车、运输、卸车等各个环节的广大职工，开展以改革运输组织工作和运输技术作业过程为中心的红旗竞赛，发动群众提高运输组织工作水平，大闹运输技术作业过程上的革命，使阜新市运输工作不断出现新成绩，并且长期巩固在高产的水平上。现在，阜新车站的全体职工已向全国装卸职工提出倡议，展开红旗竞赛，并以冲天的干劲，为创造更大的成就而奋战。
