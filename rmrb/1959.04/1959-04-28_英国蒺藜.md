    ·Lhasa Folk Song·
    British Tribulus Terrestris
    (Plus Two Other Songs)
    On Lhasa's sacred land,
    Grows a British "Tribulus Terrestris"; ①
    The teachers are big-nosed like steelyards,
    The students are hooligans and ruffians.
    You must be careful not to be fooled
    The high houses of "Dekyi Lingka", ②
    Are not places to worship Buddha;
    Young girls of Lhasa,
    You must be careful not to be fooled!
    Beside the Dekyi Lingka trees
    Beside the "Dekyi Lingka" trees,
    No one strolls during the festival,
    Not because the scenery isn't beautiful,
    But because the British devils are too hateful!
    ① Tribulus Terrestris is used by the Tibetan people to represent the most detestable thing. Here, it refers to the school established by British special agents in Lhasa's "Zhongji Lingka" before liberation. At that time, the teachers were British, and the students were the children of a dozen reactionary nobles.
    ② "Dekyi Lingka" was the residence of British special agents in Lhasa before liberation. This time, the residence of Weisajianzhan (Gongdelin Zhaza), the leader of the Lhasa rebels, was inside this "Lingka".

    ·拉萨民歌·
    英国蒺藜
    （外二首）
    拉萨神圣的土地上，
    长了一棵英国“蒺藜”；①
    先生是些秤砣鼻子，
    学生是些流氓地痞。
    你可得当心上当
    “德吉林卡”高房，②
    不是朝佛地方；
    拉萨年轻姑娘呀，
    你可得当心上当！
    德吉林卡树边
    “德吉林卡”树边，
    佳节无人游玩，
    不是风景不美丽，
    是英国鬼子太讨厌！
    ①蒺藜是藏族人民用来表示最令人讨厌的东西。这里是指解放前英国特务在拉萨“仲吉林卡”里建立的学校。当时先生是英国人，学生是十几个反动贵族的子女。
    ②“德吉林卡”是解放前英国特务在拉萨的驻地。这次拉萨叛军头子威萨坚赞（功德林扎萨）的住宅就在这“林卡”里面。
