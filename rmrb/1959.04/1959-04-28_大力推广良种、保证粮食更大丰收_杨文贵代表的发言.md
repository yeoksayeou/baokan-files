Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou, and the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now, I would like to report to the assembly on the specific implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" in the Liuzhou Special District of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, specifically regarding the "seed" aspect.

**Adopting Improved Varieties to Increase Yield Per Unit Area**

In 1958, our Liuzhou Special District, like other parts of the country, achieved great success in agricultural production. Experience has proven that using improved varieties is one of the key factors in ensuring increased yield per unit area of crops. Last year, under the leadership of the Party, with secretaries taking the lead and mobilizing the masses, we vigorously engaged in the breeding and promotion of improved varieties, achieving great results. The main points are: we clarified the base of improved varieties of various crops. That is to say, after a year of in-depth investigation and research, we basically clarified which of the main crop seeds such as rice, corn, peanuts, soybeans, sugarcane, and potatoes are improved varieties that need to be developed, which need to be temporarily retained, and which need to be eliminated. At the same time, we conducted many comparative experiments and observations on some that have not been fully clarified or that are improved varieties but have different degrees of difference between them. In this way, the development direction of several major crop improved varieties in our district is basically clear from the current level, which has laid a good foundation for better serving the great leap forward in agricultural production from the aspect of improved varieties in the future. On the other hand, a large number of improved varieties have been bred and promoted.

Last year, the focus of our entire improved variety breeding and promotion work was on rice, mainly promoting japonica rice. The entire special district planted about 600,000 mu of improved japonica rice varieties. Practice has proven that these japonica rice varieties are suitable in our district, whether in mountainous areas, hills, or plains, and yield significantly more than indica rice, especially in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas where the climate is colder, the water is cooler, the soil is deep, and the water is sufficient, because japonica rice has many advantages, mainly long ears, many grains, heavy grains, few empty grains, high rice yield, good rice quality, thick and hard stems, erect leaves, cold resistance, and resistance to lodging. The biggest yield increase factors are:

(1) Long Ears with Dense and Numerous Grains

Based on our multi-point surveys and observations in representative areas, we obtained the following information: the "Baihua 516" (a local improved indica rice variety) averaged 98.6 grains per ear, while the black japonica rice averaged 153.4 grains, an increase of 55.5% compared to "Baihua 516." In addition, the comparative experiment of the county party committee's experimental field showed that the average number of grains per ear of "Xinzheng 192" (an improved indica rice variety in our district) was 124.2, while the black japonica rice was 165.6, and the white japonica rice was 162.8, which were 31% to 33.3% more than "Xinzheng 192" respectively. The above two places represent the eastern plains area of our district. We also conducted comparative experiments in Qingyuan Town, Yishan County, which represents the central hilly area. The average number of grains per ear of "Shuiya 156" (a variety widely planted locally) was 80, while the white japonica rice had 156 grains, the black japonica rice had 148 grains, the Mawei japonica rice had 136 grains, and the Guantou japonica rice had 134 grains, which were 67.5% to 95% more than "Shuiya 156" respectively. From the above materials, it can be seen that japonica rice has 31% to 95% more grains per ear than indica rice. At the same time, it can also be seen that the average number of grains per ear of indica rice is generally only about 100, while japonica rice is mostly around 150, and these materials only come from newly promoted areas where cultivation experience is still insufficient. If in areas with rich cultivation experience, the number will not be limited to this. For example, in the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County in our district, some of the longest ears have as many as 733 grains, and many multi-grain ears with more than 700 grains have also appeared in Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, Dayaoshan Yao Autonomous County, and Huanjiang County.

(2) Large and Heavy Grains

In this regard, we have also conducted many comparisons, which clearly confirm that under the same natural and cultivation conditions, 22,500 grains of "Baihua 516" are needed to weigh one jin, while only 12,500 grains of Daba粳, 14,000 grains of Jiangnan粳, 15,000 grains of Lengshui粳, 17,000 grains of Hongxu粳, 17,500 grains of Yuantou粳, 18,000 grains of Gudong, and 18,000 grains of black japonica rice are needed to weigh one jin. From these materials, it can be known that the number of grains per jin required for japonica rice is 25% to 80% less than that of indica rice "Baihua 516."

Because japonica rice has the advantages of long ears, dense grains, numerous grains, and heavy grains, its yield per unit area is much higher than that of indica rice. Last year, the agricultural experiment station in our district compared 15 japonica rice varieties with "Baihua 516." The results showed that all 15 japonica rice varieties yielded more than indica rice, with some increasing by as much as 89.03%, and the lowest increasing by 47.84%. The above facts tell us that the promotion of improved varieties, especially the promotion of improved japonica rice varieties, has an extremely significant effect on increasing the yield per unit area of rice under the natural conditions of our district.

**Do a Better Job of Research, Breeding, Propagation and Promotion of Improved Varieties**

1959 is the second year of the three years of hard struggle, and it is also the first year of specifically organizing and leading production and arranging life after the people's communeization. No matter from which aspect, this year is a crucial year. The central government has put forward the requirement that this year's agricultural production should have a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward than in 1958. This is a great and glorious historical task. Our Liuzhou Special District, like other parts of the country, is mobilizing the entire party and all the people to take various effective measures to carry out a tenacious struggle to complete or over fulfill this great task. In terms of grain production, our district plans to guarantee a total grain output of 6.5 billion jin this year, and strive to reach 11 billion jin, ensuring an average of 2,000 jin of grain per person, and striving for 3,000 jin. We can imagine that after the growth plan is realized, the grain in our district will be greatly sufficient.

In order to accomplish this great and glorious task, we are taking a series of measures, and the work of promoting improved varieties has also made great efforts and has achieved great results. The planting of japonica rice can be expanded to about 2.5 million mu this year, accounting for 41% of the 6 million mu of rice sown area in the entire special district. As mentioned above, these improved varieties generally have an average of about 150 grains per ear, and about 12,500 to 18,000 grains per jin. At the same time, last year was the first year of our promotion, and we have not fully mastered the characteristics of japonica rice. This year is different. The technology of cultivating japonica rice has been basically mastered by the vast number of cadres and the masses. In addition, this year we have systematically implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agricultural Production." We can fully believe that these improved varieties will play a greater role in increasing production. If each mu has 250,000 to 350,000 ears, each ear can have an average of 130 grains, and an average of 16,000 grains per jin, then the yield per mu can reach 2,000 jin to 2,800 jin. The 2.5 million mu of japonica rice can produce 5 billion jin to 7 billion jin of grain. In addition, including the output of 3.5 million mu of indica rice and 1.5 million mu of corn and other miscellaneous grains, we have every reason to believe that our district's grain production increase task this year can not only be guaranteed, but also may be over fulfilled.

The development of agricultural production is endless, and seed work must continue to advance in order to meet the requirements of the development of the objective situation. The achievements we have made now are only a beginning. More important things are waiting for us to do. According to the current seed work situation in our district, in addition to ensuring the completion of this year's improved variety promotion plan, we must also go all out and strive for the top, and do a good job in the following tasks:

1. Continue to firmly grasp the promotion of japonica rice and quickly popularize it. This year, our district's promotion of japonica rice can only be expanded to about 2.5 million mu, accounting for only 41% of the total rice sown area. We must vigorously propagate and ensure that about 70% of the paddy fields will be planted with japonica rice next year.

2. On the basis of popularization, strive to select and cultivate more and better new varieties. It is a fact that japonica rice yields more than indica rice, but the difference in yield between japonica rice and japonica rice is also very large. We should seize the selection of the best varieties among them for propagation and promotion, and quickly replace the current relatively poor varieties. We must vigorously propagate what has already been evaluated, and what has not yet been evaluated needs to be widely and extensively compared between japonica rice varieties.

On the other hand, we must also vigorously strive to cultivate better varieties in a relatively short period of time through hybridization and panicle selection.

3. Establish an improved variety breeding network. Under the leadership of the Party, new and excellent varieties must continue to emerge. The problem is how to promote these cultivated improved varieties by using more, faster, better and more economical methods, quickly popularize them, and regularly rotate and rejuvenate them. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a relatively complete improved variety breeding network. The special district has established a parent seed farm, and each county has also established an improved seed farm. The production team of the people's commune should establish an improved seed production team. The task of the parent seed farm in the special district is mainly to propagate parent seeds to supply the seeds needed by the improved seed farms in each county, and to supply the seeds needed for the demonstration areas of improved seed high-yield production in some key communes. The main task of the county-level improved seed farm is to supply the improved seeds needed by the improved seed production teams in each commune within the county. The improved seed production team is to supply the seeds for field production for each production brigade. In this way, the work of breeding and promoting improved varieties can be smoothly carried out from top to bottom, from bottom to top, and from county A to county B, forming a network of improved variety breeding and promotion.

Seed work is a science. In today's technological revolution, seed theory must have a greater leap forward in order to adapt to the development of the new situation. Under the leadership of the Party, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line of building socialism, we have full confidence and determination to do a better job in the research, breeding, propagation and promotion of improved varieties, and to ensure a greater harvest of grain.

### 大力推广良种、保证粮食更大丰收  杨文贵代表的发言

专栏：

    大力推广良种、保证粮食更大丰收
    杨文贵代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理所作的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的报告。现在我仅就广西僮族自治区柳州专区在贯彻农业增产“八字宪法”中有关“种”字的具体贯彻执行情况向大会作如下汇报。
    采用优良品种提高单位面积产量
    一九五八年我们柳州专区在农业生产方面和全国各地一样取得了伟大的成绩，经验证明，采用优良品种是保证农作物单位面积产量提高的重要关键之一。去年我区的种子工作在党的领导下，书记挂帅，发动群众，大搞良种繁殖推广工作，取得了很大的成绩。主要是：摸清了各种农作物良种的底子，就是说，经过了一年的深入调查研究，对水稻、玉米、花生、黄豆、甘蔗、薯类等主要农作物种子基本弄清了那些是良种、需要发展，那些需要暂时保留，那一些需要淘汰。同时有一些尚未完全弄清的或者虽是良种，但它们之间的不同程度的差别也作了许多比较试验和观察工作，这样，我区几项主要作物良种的发展方向，从现有水平来要求基本是明确了，这对于今后进一步的搞好良种工作，从良种方面来更好的为农业生产大跃进服务打下了一个相当良好的基础。另一方面，大量繁殖推广了许多良种。
    去年，我区整个良种繁殖推广工作的重心放在水稻方面，主要是推广粳稻。全专区共种植粳稻良种约六十万亩，实践证明，这些粳稻在我区范围内不论山区、丘陵、平原，看来都是适合的，比籼稻增产显著，特别在那些气候较冷，水较凉、土深、水足的山区半山区增产更加显著，因为粳稻具有很多优越性，主要是穗长、粒多、粒重、秕粒少、出米率高、米质好、茎秆粗硬，叶直立、耐寒、不易倒伏等优良特性。其中最大的增产因素是：
    （一）穗长粒密粒多
    根据我们在有代表性的地区多点进行调查研究观察、获得如下情况：石龙县粮食局试验田品比试验结果，“白花516”（当地籼稻良种）平均每穗有九十八点六粒，而黑粳则平均有一百五十三点四粒，比“白花516”增加了百分之五十五点五，又该县县委试验田品比试验结果，“新证192”（我区籼稻良种）平均穗粒为一百二十四点二，而黑粳为一百六十五点六，白粳一百六十二点八，分别比“新证192”多百分之三十一至三十三点三。以上两处是代表我区东部平原地区，我们又在代表中部丘陵地区的宜山县庆远镇进行品比试验结果，“水芽156”（当地种植较多的品种）平均穗粒是八十，而白粳则有一百五十六粒，黑粳有一百四十八粒，马尾粳有一百三十六粒，光头粳有一百三十四粒，分别比“水芽156”多百分之六十七点五至九十五，从以上材料可以看出粳稻比籼稻每穗平均粒数多百分之三十一至九十五。同时还可以看出籼稻每穗一般平均仅在一百粒左右，粳稻则大都在一百五十粒左右，而且我们这些材料，只是来自栽培经验还不足的新推广地区，如果在具有丰富栽培经验的地区尚不只此数，譬如，我区大苗山苗族自治县就有一些最长的穗多到七百三十三粒，三江侗族自治县、大瑶山瑶族自治县及环江县等地也出现不少七百粒以上的多粒穗。
    （二）粒大粒重
    在这方面，我们也进行了许多比较，很明显的证实，在相同的自然条件和栽培条件下，
  “白花516”要二万二千五百粒才有一斤重，而大白粳只要一万二千五百粒，江南粳要一万四千粒，冷水粳一万五千粒，红须粳一万七千粒，圆头粳一万七千五百粒，谷董一万八千粒，黑粳一万八千粒就有一斤了，从这些材料可以知道粳稻比籼稻“白花516”每斤所需粒数可减少百分之二十五至八十。
    由于粳稻具有穗长粒密粒多粒重等优越因素，就构成了它的单位面积产量大大的超过籼稻。去年我区农业试验站用十五个粳稻品种和“白花516”进行比较试验结果，十五个粳稻都比籼稻增产高，有的增产达百分之八十九点零三，最低也增产了百分之四十七点八四；上述事实告诉我们，推广良种特别是推广粳稻良种在我区的自然条件下对提高水稻单位面积产量的作用是极其显著的。
    把良种研究培育繁殖推广工作做得更好
    一九五九年是苦战三年的第二年，也是人民公社化后具体组织领导生产安排生活的第一年，不论从那一方面来说，今年都是带有关键性的一年。中央已提出要求，今年在农业生产方面要有一个比一九五八年更大更好更全面的跃进，这是一个伟大而光荣的历史任务。我们柳州专区和全国各地一样，正在全党动员、全民动手、采取各种有效措施，为完成或超额完成这一伟大任务而进行顽强战斗。在粮食生产方面，我区今年计划粮食总产量保证达到六十五亿斤，争取达到一百一十亿斤，保证每人平均有粮二千斤，争取三千斤，我们可以设想增长计划实现以后，我区粮食将大大充足。
    为了完成这一伟大而光荣的任务，我们正在采取一系列的措施，良种推广工作也做了巨大的努力，并已取得很大成绩。粳稻种植今年可以扩大到二百五十万亩左右，占全专区水稻播种面积六百万亩的百分之四十一。如上所述，这些良种一般每穗平均都在一百五十粒左右，一万二千五百至一万八千粒左右就有一斤，同时去年我们是新推广的一年，对粳稻的特性尚未完全掌握，今年则不同了，栽培粳稻的技术已基本为广大干部和群众所掌握，再加上今年比较系统地贯彻了农业增产“八字宪法”，我们完全可以深信这些良种将会更发挥其增产作用，如果每亩以二十五万至三十五万穗，每穗平均能有一百三十粒，平均每一万六千粒有一斤来计算，那亩产就可达二千斤至二千八百斤，二百五十万亩的粳稻就可以产粮食五十亿斤到七十亿斤，再加上三百五十万亩的籼稻和一百五十万亩的玉米及其它杂粮的产量在内，我们完全有理由相信今年我区粮食增产任务不但能够保证完成，而且有可能超额完成。
    农业生产的发展是无止境的，种子工作要继续前进，才能满足客观形势发展的要求，现在所取得的一些成绩仅仅是个开端，更重要的事情正在等待我们去做，根据当前我区种子工作情况，除保证完成今年良种推广计划外，还须鼓足干劲力争上游，搞好以下几项工作：
    1、继续抓紧粳稻推广工作，迅速普及。今年我区推广粳稻只能扩大到二百五十万亩左右，仅占整个水稻播种面积百分之四十一，还要大力繁殖，作到明年有百分之七十左右水田种植粳稻。
    2、在普及的基础上，努力挑选和培育更多更好的新品种。粳稻比籼稻增产，这是事实，但粳稻和粳稻之间产量的差别，悬殊也很大，应当抓紧挑选出其中最好的品种加以繁殖推广，迅速代替当前比较差的品种。现在已经评比出来了的要大力繁殖，尚未评定的需要广泛的大量的进行粳稻之间的品种比较试验工作。
    另一方面，还要大力的通过杂交和穗选争取在较短的时间内培育更好的品种出来。
    3、建立良种繁殖网。在党的领导下，今后新的优良品种一定要源源不断的出现问题，就是如何把这些培育出来的良种采用多快好省的方法推广下去，迅速普及，定期轮换复壮。因此须要建立一套比较完整的良种繁殖网。专区已建立原种场，各县也已建立良种场，人民公社的生产大队要建立良种生产队，专区原种场的任务：主要是繁殖原种供应各县良种场所需要的种子，结合供应部分重点公社良种丰产示范区所需的种子，县良种场主要是：供应本县范围内各公社良种生产队所需要的良种。良种生产队是供应各生产大队大田生产用种。这样良种繁殖推广工作就可以迅速地由上到下由下到上由甲县到乙县顺利地开展起来，形成了一个良种繁殖推广网。
    种子工作是一门科学，在技术大革命的今天，种子学说一定要有一个更大的跃进才能适应新形势的发展。在党的领导下，在建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，我们具有充分的信心和决心，把良种研究培育繁殖推广工作做得更好，保证粮食更大丰收。
