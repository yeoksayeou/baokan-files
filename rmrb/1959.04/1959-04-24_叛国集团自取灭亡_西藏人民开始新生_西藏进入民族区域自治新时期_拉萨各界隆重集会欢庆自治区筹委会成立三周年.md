Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 23rd: Over a thousand representatives from all ethnic groups and sectors in Lhasa held a grand meeting on the 22nd to celebrate the third anniversary of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, the organ through which the Tibetan people exercise their autonomous rights.

	Those participating in the celebration included Living Buddhas, Khenpos, and Lamas in red robes, upper-class figures, a vast number of Tibetan cadres, Tibetan workers, farmers, urban residents, and representatives from the People's Liberation Army. These people of different statuses, occupations, and identities gathered together intimately today. For the past three years, many of them have participated in the celebration of the founding of the Preparatory Committee, but never with such a sense of ease. In the past, the rostrum of the celebration was also occupied by traitorous elements bearing the title of "Committee Member" of the Preparatory Committee. They gesticulated and gave grand speeches on the rostrum, but after the meeting, they engaged in clandestine activities to undermine the work of the Preparatory Committee. Now, those double-dealing traitorous elements have embarked on the path of betraying the motherland and inviting their own destruction. The Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region has become more united and stronger than ever before. This third-anniversary celebration marks the first time the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has exercised the functions of the local government of Tibet. It signals that the Tibetan people have entered a new era of ethnic regional autonomy.

	The venue was decorated with huge banners in both Tibetan and Chinese: "Celebrate the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee Exercising the Functions of the Local Government of Tibet!" "Consolidate the unity and unification of the motherland!" "Thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion!" Countless colorful flags fluttered in the wind.

	The conference began amidst the music of "Socialism is Good." Zhang Guohua, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke first.

	In his speech, Zhang Guohua outlined the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region over the past three years. He said: "Under the correct leadership of the Party and the Central People's Government, with the help of the people of all fraternal ethnic groups across the country and the strong support of the vast number of monks and laypeople in Tibet, patriotic and progressive individuals working in the Preparatory Committee, and personnel entering Tibet, have done some work and achieved some results in strengthening ethnic unity and the anti-imperialist, patriotic united front. However, due to the consistent obstruction and sabotage by the former local government of Tibet and upper-class reactionary elements, the Preparatory Committee has not played much of a role in the past nearly three years. The basic task of the Preparatory Committee—preparing for the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region—has made no progress, and the glorious mission entrusted by the state and the Tibetan people has not been accomplished."

	Zhang Guohua pointed out: "The Central People's Government has always adhered to the policy of ethnic regional autonomy. More than 90% of the members of the leadership of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region are Tibetan upper-class figures, and the Central Government has only sent a small number of necessary personnel to participate in the work. All resolutions of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region and the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee are made after full consultation. Except for two occasions when he was unable to attend the meetings of the Preparatory Committee due to matters (one was to attend the 2,500th anniversary of the Nirvana of Sakyamuni in India, and the other was to hold religious activities in Norbulingka), the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, the Dalai Lama, personally presided over and approved the decisions at all other meetings."

	Zhang Guohua said that the fundamental reason why the Preparatory Committee had not played much of a role was the obstruction and sabotage by the former local government of Tibet and upper-class reactionary groups. He said: "Over the past three years, although the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region has made many resolutions, they have not been implemented due to the sabotage of the former local government of Tibet and upper-class reactionary groups. Reactionary elements threatened and attacked officials and staff working in the Preparatory Committee, openly demanding that these people leave the Preparatory Committee and sever ties with the organs of the Preparatory Committee, forced some of them to sign the treasonous declaration of their so-called 'Independent Tibet,' openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, launched a full-scale armed rebellion, and abducted the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, the Dalai Lama."

	Zhang Guohua pointed out: "The above facts show that the Tibetan traitorous clique fundamentally does not want to realize democratic ethnic regional autonomy with the participation of the people. What they want is the so-called 'Tibetan independence' that imperialism has planned for many years. However, this kind of delusion can never be realized, because it seriously violates the common interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, especially the interests of the Tibetan people."

	Zhang Guohua said that, according to the order of the State Council on March 28, the former local government of Tibet, which had betrayed the motherland and the people, had been dissolved, and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region had officially exercised the functions of the local government of Tibet. Under the personal chairmanship of the Acting Chairman, Panchen Erdeni, the plenary meeting of the Preparatory Committee passed five resolutions that conformed to the wishes of the Tibetan people, including the implementation of the order of the State Council. We believe that under the leadership of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, the entire Tibetan people will unite and act together, and the formal Tibet Autonomous Region will be realized soon.

	Zhang Guohua said: "In the future, the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region should make a hundredfold effort, rely on the entire Tibetan people, further strengthen ethnic unity, strengthen the anti-imperialist, patriotic united front, unite all patriotic forces that can be united, actively lead the Tibetan people, and strive to realize ethnic regional autonomy in Tibet as soon as possible and establish a formal Tibet Autonomous Region."

	Pabala Gelleg Namgyal, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, was unable to attend the celebration due to illness. However, during the conference, Deputy Chairman Pabala sent someone to deliver a congratulatory article he had written for the third anniversary of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region.

	Lamin Yixi Chuchen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, spoke at the meeting. Lamin Yixi Chuchen had served as Deputy Secretary-General since the first day of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region. In his speech, he used his own personal experiences to expose the various ways in which the former local government of Tibet and upper-class reactionary groups undermined the Preparatory Committee.

	Lamin Yixi Chuchen said: "The reason why the work of the Preparatory Committee has not achieved any results or progress in the past is due to the various obstructions of reactionary elements." He said: "In order to safeguard the interests of a minority of people, the former local government of Tibet and upper-class reactionary groups colluded with imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary faction, and bandits who fled from the Xikang area, carrying out various reactionary and destructive activities, ignoring the patient advice of the Central People's Government. On March 17, they intensified their actions, abducting the Dalai Lama to foreign countries. On the 19th, they launched a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa and various central organs stationed in Lhasa, fundamentally tearing up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet signed in 1951, betraying the motherland, and betraying the people."

	Lamin Yixi Chuchen said: "The dissolution of the former local government of Tibet and the exercise of its functions by the Preparatory Committee is a great happy event. This is to dig out the poisonous roots that have harmed and oppressed the people and plant the beneficial roots of happiness and light."

	Lamin Yixi Chuchen said: "In the future, the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region will, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the support of the 600 million people of all ethnic groups across the country, lead the entire Tibetan people to strive to build a new Tibet that is equal, happy, prosperous, democratic, and socialist to the end."

	General Tan Guansan, Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, guaranteed to the conference on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Tibet Military Region that the troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet would certainly live up to the earnest expectations of the vast number of Tibetan people and strive to thoroughly quell the rebellion and liberate the Tibetan people.

	In his speech, General Tan Guansan also sternly refuted the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials on April 18, pointing out that it reflected the will of imperialism and Indian expansionists and could not possibly have come from the Dalai Lama's own intention. General Tan Guansan said: "On the 29th day of the 12th month of the Tibetan calendar last year, when the Potala Palace performed the masked dance, the Dalai Lama himself proposed to Deng Shaodong, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, that he wanted to go to the Military Region to see the performances of the cultural troupe. Later, the Dalai Lama personally set the date on March 10. After the former local government of Tibet and upper-class reactionary groups launched the rebellion on March 10, the Dalai Lama wrote me three personal letters expressing the difficult situation he was in, surrounded by reactionary elements. Why are these facts not mentioned at all in the so-called 'Statement of the Dalai Lama'?"

	General Tan Guansan pointed out that the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" had nothing in common with the Dalai Lama's usual words and deeds or with the three personal letters the Dalai Lama wrote to him.

	Sangpo Tenzin Dhondup, a member of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region who was injured by the rebels in the March 10th incident, came to the celebration with the help of a cane and spoke at the meeting. Sangpo Tenzin Dhondup was one of the Kalons of the former local government of Tibet and is the Deputy Commander of the Tibet Military Region. He said that he was attending this conference with an excitement he had never felt before, because after the self-destruction of the reactionary clique of the former local government of Tibet, the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region would no longer be sabotaged, and it would henceforth exercise the rights of Tibetan ethnic regional autonomy in a true sense. The Tibetan people will gradually embark on the path of light and happiness.

	Dingjie Living Buddha, Deputy Director of the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee, also spoke at the celebration. Dingjie Living Buddha congratulated the conference on behalf of people from religious circles in Tibet and severely condemned the crimes of the rebellious elements in undermining the unification of the motherland and harming the Tibetan people. He said: "We people from religious circles guarantee to fully support the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion and contribute our strength to the happiness of the Tibetan people."

	Representatives from the Lhasa Youth Federation, Women's Federation, schools, and residents also spoke at the celebration. The people who had suffered hardships and had no status for a long time had the right to speak for the first time at the celebration of the founding of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region. Solang Dorje, a representative of the residents, thanked the People's Liberation Army at the meeting with great enthusiasm for driving away the bloodsucking jackals for them, removing the stones on their heads, and bringing them freedom and a new life. He said: "This time, the sun of happiness has truly risen over the heads of us poor people!" (Attached picture)

    叛国集团自取灭亡　西藏人民开始新生
    西藏进入民族区域自治新时期
    拉萨各界隆重集会欢庆自治区筹委会成立三周年
    新华社拉萨23日　电拉萨市各族各界代表一千多人22日隆重集会，庆祝西藏人民行使自治权利的机关——自治区筹备委员会成立三周年。
    参加庆祝大会的有身披红色袈裟的活佛、堪布和喇嘛，有上层人士，有广大藏族干部、藏族工人、农民、市民和人民解放军代表。这些不同地位、不同职业和不同身份的人们，今天亲密地欢聚在一堂。三年来，他们中许多人每年都参加过庆祝筹委会成立的大会，但从来没有像今天这样心情舒畅。过去，在庆祝会主席台上还坐着一些挂着筹委会“委员”招牌的叛国分子，他们在讲台上指手划脚地高谈阔论，而一散会，又干起破坏筹委会工作的见不得人的勾当。现在，那些阳奉阴违的叛国分子们已走上了叛变祖国的自取灭亡的道路，自治区筹备委员会变得比以前任何时候都更加团结和壮大了。这次三周年庆祝大会，正是西藏自治区筹委会行使西藏地方政府职权后的第一次，它标志着西藏人民进入了民族区域自治的新时代。
    会场里装饰着藏、汉两种文字的巨幅标语：“庆祝西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权！”“巩固祖国的团结和统一！”“彻底平息西藏叛乱！”无数面彩旗迎风招展。
    大会在“社会主义好”的乐声中开始。西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员张国华首先讲话。
    张国华在讲话中概述了西藏自治区筹备委员会三年来的工作情况。他说：“在党和中央人民政府正确领导下，在全国各兄弟民族人民的帮助和西藏广大僧俗人民的大力支持下，在自治区筹委会工作的爱国进步人士和进藏工作人员，在加强民族团结、反帝爱国统一战线等方面做了一些工作，也取得了一定的成绩。但是，由于原西藏地方政府和上层反动分子一贯地进行阻挠和破坏，筹委会在过去将近三年的时间里没有起到什么作用。筹委会的基本任务——成立西藏自治区的筹备工作也一无进展，没有完成国家和西藏人民所交予的光荣使命。”
    张国华指出：“中央人民政府一贯坚持民族区域自治的政策。在自治区筹备委员会的领导成员中90％以上的委员是由西藏藏族上层人士担任的，中央只派少数必要的工作人员参加工作。自治区筹委会和筹委会常委会的一切决议，都是事先经过充分协商的。筹委会主任委员达赖喇嘛除两次因事（一次是赴印度参加释迦牟尼涅槃两千五百周年纪念，一次是在罗布林卡举行宗教活动）未亲自参加筹委会会议外，其余历次会议都是在达赖喇嘛亲自主持下举行并通过决定的。”
    张国华说，筹委会所以没有起到什么作用，根本原因是原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的阻挠破坏。他说：“三年来，自治区筹备委员会虽然作出了许多决议，但由于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的破坏，都得不到贯彻执行。反动分子对在筹委会工作的官员和工作人员进行威胁和打击，公然要这些人脱离筹委会，同筹委会机关断绝来往，强迫其中部分人在他们所谓‘西藏独立国’的叛国宣言上签字，公开撕毁和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，发动全面武装叛乱，劫走筹委会主任委员达赖喇嘛。”
    张国华指出：“以上这些事实，说明西藏叛国集团根本就不愿实现有人民参加的民主的民族区域自治，他们所要的是帝国主义多年策划的所谓‘西藏独立’。但是，他们这种妄想是永远不能实现的，因为它严重地违反了全国各族人民的共同利益，首先是西藏人民的利益。”
    张国华说，根据国务院3月28日的命令，背叛祖国背叛人民的原西藏地方政府已经被解散，西藏自治区筹备委员会已正式行使了西藏地方政府的职权。在代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼的亲自主持下，筹委会全体委员会议通过了关于贯彻执行国务院命令等五项符合西藏人民愿望的决议。我们相信，在自治区筹委会的领导下，全西藏人民一致行动起来，正式的西藏自治区必将会早日实现。
    张国华说：“今后自治区筹委会应该百倍努力，依靠全体西藏人民，进一步加强民族团结，加强反帝爱国统一战线，团结一切可以团结的爱国力量，积极领导西藏人民，为提早实现西藏民族区域自治，建立正式的西藏自治区而奋斗。”
      自治区筹备委员会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰因养病未能出席庆祝大会。但在大会进行期间，帕巴拉副主任委员派人送来了他为自治区筹委会成立三周年赶写的庆祝文章。
    自治区筹备委员会副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣在会上讲了话。拉敏·益喜楚臣从自治区筹委会成立第一天起就担任副秘书长，他在讲话中用自己切身的感受，揭露了原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团对筹委会的种种破坏。
    拉敏·益喜楚臣说：“过去筹委会工作没有取得什么成绩和进步，这是由于反动分子们的多方面的阻挠。”他说：“原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团为了维护少数人的利益，穷凶极恶地勾结帝国主义、蒋介石反动派和从西康地区逃来的匪徒，进行各种反动破坏活动，对中央人民政府的耐心劝告置之不理。3月17日竟变本加厉，劫持达赖喇嘛去国外，19日向驻拉萨的人民解放军和中央驻拉萨各机关发动了全面进攻，根本撕毁了1951年签订的和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，背叛了祖国，背叛了人民。”
    拉敏·益喜楚臣说：“解散原西藏地方政府，由筹委会行使它的职权，这是天大的喜事。这是挖掉了残害和压迫人民的毒根，种植了幸福和光明的益根。”
    拉敏·益喜楚臣说：“自治区筹委会今后要在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，在全国各族六亿人民支援下，领导全西藏人民为建设平等、幸福、繁荣、民主、社会主义的新西藏而奋斗到底。”
    人民解放军西藏军区政治委员谭冠三将军代表西藏军区全体指战员向大会保证：人民解放军驻藏部队一定不辜负广大西藏人民的殷切期望，为彻底平息叛乱，解放西藏人民而奋斗。
    谭冠三将军在讲话中还严词驳斥了4月18日由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，指出它反映了帝国主义和印度扩张主义者的意志，决不会是出自达赖喇嘛的本意。谭冠三将军说：“藏历去年12月29日，布达拉宫跳神时，达赖喇嘛自己向军区副司令员邓少东提出要到军区看文工团表演，以后达赖喇嘛亲自把日期确定在3月10日。3月10日原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动叛乱后，达赖喇嘛给我写了三封亲笔信，表示了他被反动分子包围的困难处境。这些事实，为什么在所谓‘达赖喇嘛的声明’中一字也看不到？”
    谭冠三将军指出，所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，无论同达赖喇嘛平时的言行或者同达赖喇嘛给我的三封亲笔信对照看来，都毫无共同之处。
    曾在3月10日事件中被叛匪打伤的自治区筹委会常务委员桑颇·才旺仁增，扶着手杖来参加庆祝大会，并在会上讲了话。桑颇·才旺仁增是原西藏地方政府的噶伦之一，是西藏军区副司令员，他说，他怀着从来未有过的兴奋心情来参加这个大会，因为在原西藏地方政府的反动集团自取灭亡以后，自治区筹委会的工作再也不会遭到破坏，它从此将名副其实地行使西藏民族区域自治的权利，西藏人民将逐步走上光明幸福的道路。
    在庆祝大会上讲话的还有筹委会宗教事务委员会副主任丁杰活佛。丁杰活佛代表西藏宗教界人士向大会祝贺，并严厉斥责了叛乱分子破坏祖国统一残害西藏人民的罪行。他说：“我们宗教界人士保证全力支持人民解放军平息叛乱，为西藏人民的幸福贡献自己的力量。”
    在庆祝大会上讲话的，还有拉萨市青联、妇联、学校和居民的代表。长期以来遭受苦难没有地位的人民，第一次在庆祝自治区筹委会成立的大会上有了发言权。居民代表索郎多吉满怀热情地在会上感谢人民解放军为他们赶走了吃血的豺狼，搬开了头上的石块，为他们带来了自由和新生活。他说：“在我们穷苦人民头上，这回真正升起了幸福的太阳！”（附图片）
