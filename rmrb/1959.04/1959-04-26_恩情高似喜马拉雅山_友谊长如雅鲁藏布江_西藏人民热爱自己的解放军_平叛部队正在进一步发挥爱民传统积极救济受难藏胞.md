Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 24th: "Below the mountains, stars appear, but they are not stars, they are the People's Liberation Army. Day and night, they cross mountains and ridges, turning themselves over for the sake of the Tibetan people." Among the Tibetan people, on the Himalayas, and on the banks of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, Tibetan folk songs praising the People's Liberation Army and heartwarming stories of the friendly coexistence between the army and the people are spreading.

    The Army Has Strict Discipline, Not Violating Even a Hair
    Protecting the Interests of the Tibetan People Everywhere

In recent years, the People's Liberation Army's Tibet Military Region has resolutely implemented the Party's ethnic policies, respecting the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people, and protecting the interests of the Tibetan people everywhere. PLA officers and soldiers stationed in various parts of Tibet have gained an in-depth understanding of the local people's customs and habits, learned Tibetan language and writing, maintained close contact with Tibetan compatriots, promoted the Party's ethnic policies, and proactively helped them solve various difficulties, strengthening the unity between the army and the people. Tibetan compatriots unanimously reflect that the stationed troops have strict discipline, not violating even a hair. Even in the battles to suppress the bandits this time, they strictly implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Sometimes, when using ownerless firewood, they would leave money in its place according to the market price. When the troops were marching, even under arduous and tiring conditions, they insisted on camping in tents in the wilderness, not staying in civilian houses or lama temples. In the urgent situation of pursuing and annihilating the bandits, they tried every means to return the livestock looted by the bandits to the Tibetan compatriots.

    Building Bridges and Roads, Developing Industrial and Agricultural Production
    Inspiring the Labor Enthusiasm of the Tibetan People

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet has also helped the Tibetan people develop their economy and improve their living standards. The vast number of officers and soldiers have actively participated in the industrial and agricultural construction of the Tibet region. In recent years, the Tibet Military Region troops have worked with Tibetan compatriots to open up dozens of mountains thousands of meters above sea level, and built bridges over hundreds of rivers, initially establishing a road network in the Tibet region.

PLA officers and soldiers have helped Tibetan compatriots build many water conservancy projects. Since October last year, the PLA stationed in Lhasa has been involved in the construction of the Lhasa East Suburb Hydropower Station. After the hydropower station is completed, it will be able to store 20 to 30 million cubic meters of water, generate 6,000 kilowatts of electricity, provide convenient power for the entire city's civil and industrial use, and provide convenience for the city's water supply and farmland irrigation. The Tibet Military Region troops have also established timber processing plants, food processing plants, milk plants, soap factories, chemical fertilizer plants, leather factories, paper mills, etc. in various parts of Tibet, which strongly supported local industrial construction and inspired the production enthusiasm of Tibetan compatriots.

The high-yield experimental fields cultivated by PLA officers and soldiers in Lhasa, Xigaze, Gada Gram, Pulan County, and other regions, as well as the introduction of some varieties of food crops and vegetables that had not been planted in Tibet in the past to the Tibetan Plateau, allowing them to bloom and bear fruit there, had a great influence on the development of agricultural production by the Tibetan people. Providing agricultural production technology guidance to Tibetan compatriots, donating improved varieties, and helping Tibetan compatriots cultivate land have become regular tasks for the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Tibet Military Region troops.

    Crossing Mountains and Ridges to Provide Medical Treatment to the People
    Resolutely Rescuing the People from Water and Fire

The medical personnel of the troops stationed in Tibet also often treat Tibetan compatriots for diseases. In order to treat patients, PLA medical personnel often climb mountains and ridges, going to the homes of Tibetan compatriots to treat diseases despite the hardships. A certain border post unit stationed in Ali treated 2,640 Tibetan compatriots. A Tibetan named Qunpei Quetan, who was cured of a serious illness, specially led a yak from hundreds of miles away, holding a Hada to the troops to express his gratitude.

In the struggle against natural disasters, the officers and soldiers of the Tibet Military Region in Tibet demonstrated the noble character of fearlessness and selflessness in order to protect the lives and property of the Tibetan people. Once, the PLA troops stationed in Pikang, Tibet, discovered that a village in the distance was on fire. Although the village was far from the garrison, the PLA soldiers still ran to put out the fire. The fire was huge and the smoke was thick. The soldiers ignored the danger and went into the smoke-filled house. Soldier Zou Lungui was knocked down by the smoke and fire. His comrades rescued him and told him to rest. After Zou Lungui woke up, he rushed back into the thick smoke and flames to rescue property for the Tibetan compatriots. They fought the fire for more than ten hours and finally put it out, rescuing more than 4,000 jin of highland barley, more than 200 sheep, 18 cattle, and 16 horses. The fire was extinguished, but the houses of the Tibetan compatriots had been burned down. What to do? The soldiers gave them their tents and also issued more than 1,000 liters of zanba flour as relief grain. Once, when PLA soldiers Ma Fuan and others were patrolling the garrison, they found that the water was surging against a dam. A gap appeared in the dam, and the gap was getting bigger and bigger. There was a danger of the dam collapsing and causing a flood. So, Ma Fuan took the lead and jumped into the raging torrent, using his body to block the gap in the dam. Two other PLA soldiers, Li Fugui and Zhao Zongxi, saw that Ma Fuan could not block it alone, so they jumped into the water to block the gap.

By the time a large number of soldiers and civilians rushed to rescue the dam after hearing the news, their bodies had been soaked purple by the cold snow water that had just melted in the spring.

    The Army and the People Get Along Like Milk and Water
    Reluctant to Part, They Compete to Send Each Other Off

Since the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, they have established an ever-deepening friendship with Tibetan compatriots. Therefore, when many companies are rotated, the residents of the garrison are reluctant to part and compete to send them off from afar. Once, when a certain PLA unit stationed near Gyangze was transferred, the local people organized a farewell party, and men, women, old and young all came to participate in festive costumes. When the chairman stepped onto the podium and just finished saying "The benefactor PLA is leaving," the crowd under the stage burst into tears, and all the soldiers of the company shed tears. The speech could not continue, so they had to start giving gifts. The masses sent a lot of butter, Hada, and eggs. The troops declined repeatedly, but to no avail. In the end, they had to accept some to keep as souvenirs. After the gifts were given, the soldiers and civilians held hands and danced around the bonfire. Early the next morning, the masses were waiting by the roadside to say goodbye to the soldiers. Young men and women competed to carry things for the soldiers, and the old ladies walked, talked, and cried all the way for more than 20 miles, insisting on sending them further. After repeated persuasion from the troops, they selected six male and female representatives to lead mules and horses to send them for a day. They were only willing to go home when the troops arrived at their new garrison. Countless heartwarming stories like this, where the army and the people are as close as milk and water, can be found in Tibet.

Currently, the People's Liberation Army's pacification troops are further developing the tradition of cherishing the Tibetan people, providing relief to the Tibetan compatriots who have been looted by the rebels, issuing them clothing and relief grain, and solving their difficulties in life. When the masses lack agricultural tools, many troops also try to issue them hoes and other agricultural tools. The vast number of officers and soldiers stationed in Tibet also use the gaps between battles to hoe the ground, carry water, treat diseases, and sweep the floor for the masses. The Tibetan compatriots hate the Tibetan traitorous group to the bone. Many of them, when they see the PLA, are like encountering sweet dew in a long drought, and they have accused the rebels of their heinous crimes. The Tibetan people all say that the PLA is "the Bodhisattva soldiers sent by Chairman Mao." Tibetan herdsmen presented Hada to the veterinary epidemic prevention teams, thanking the medical personnel for curing their sick livestock. (Attached pictures)

### 恩情高似喜马拉雅山　友谊长如雅鲁藏布江  西藏人民热爱自己的解放军  平叛部队正在进一步发挥爱民传统积极救济受难藏胞

    恩情高似喜马拉雅山　友谊长如雅鲁藏布江
    西藏人民热爱自己的解放军
    平叛部队正在进一步发挥爱民传统积极救济受难藏胞
    新华社拉萨24日电　“山下边，出星星，不是星星是解放军。日夜翻山又越岭，为了藏民把身翻。”在西藏人民中间，在喜马拉雅山上，在雅鲁藏布江滨，传遍了颂扬人民解放军的藏民歌声和军民之间友好相处的佳话。
    大军纪律严明秋毫无犯
    处处爱护藏族人民利益
    几年来，人民解放军西藏军区部队坚决贯彻了党的民族政策，尊重藏族人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，处处爱护藏族人民的利益。驻扎在西藏各地的解放军官兵们，都深入了解当地人民的风土人情，学习藏语、藏文，和藏胞密切联系，宣传党的民族政策，主动帮助他们解决各种困难，加强军民团结。西藏同胞一致反映驻军纪律严明，秋毫无犯。就是在这次讨伐叛匪的战斗中，也严格执行三大纪律八项注意。有时用了无主的柴草，也按市价把钱留在原处。部队行军时，在艰苦疲劳的情况下，也坚持搭帐篷野营，不住民房和喇嘛庙。在追歼叛匪的紧急情况下，他们还想尽一切办法，把缴获叛匪劫走的牲畜，归还给藏胞。
    修桥筑路发展工农生产
    鼓舞藏族人民劳动热情
    驻在西藏的人民解放军还帮助藏族人民发展经济，提高生活水平，广大官兵都积极参加了西藏地区的工农业建设。几年以来，西藏军区部队与西藏同胞一起打通了数十座海拔几千公尺的大山，在成百条河流上架起桥梁，初步建成了西藏地区的公路网。
    解放军官兵们帮助西藏同胞修建了许多水利工程。驻拉萨解放军从去年10月份起投入了拉萨市东郊水电站的建设工程。这个水电站建成后，能蓄水二千万到三千万公方，发电六千瓩，可供全市民用和工业用电，并且为全市用水和农田灌溉提供了便利条件。西藏军区部队还在西藏各地建立了木材加工厂、食品加工厂、牛奶厂、肥皂厂、化学肥料厂、皮革厂、造纸厂等，有力地支援了地方工业建设，鼓舞了西藏同胞的生产热情。
    解放军官兵们在拉萨、日喀则、噶大克、普兰宗和其他地区开荒种植的高产试验田，以及把一些过去在西藏没有种植过的粮食蔬菜作物的品种引进西藏高原，让它在那里开花结果，对西藏人民发展农业生产起了很大的影响。对西藏同胞进行农业增产技术指导、赠送优良品种和帮助西藏同胞耕作，已经成为西藏军区部队广大官兵们经常作的事情。
    翻山越岭登门为民治病
    奋不顾身救民水火之中
    驻西藏部队的医护人员们，还经常替西藏同胞医疗疾病。为了救治病人，解放军医护人员常常爬山越岭，不辞劳苦到西藏同胞家中治病。驻阿里某边卡部队给当地藏胞治病二千六百四十人次。一位被治好了重病的藏民群沛却旦特地从百里外牵着牦牛、拿着哈达送到部队表示感谢。
    在与自然灾害作斗争中，西藏军区官兵们为了救护西藏人民的生命和财产，表现了奋不顾身、舍己为人的崇高品德。有一次，驻在西藏皮康的解放军部队发现远处一个村子失火了，虽然村子离驻地很远，但是解放军战士们仍然跑步前去灭火。火很大浓烟滚滚，战士们不顾危险钻进了冒着浓烟的房子。战士邹伦贵被烟火熏倒了，同志们把他救出来，让他休息。邹伦贵清醒过来后，又争着冲进浓烟烈火中替西藏同胞抢救财物。他们和大火奋战了十几小时，终于把火扑灭了，抢救出青稞四千多斤，羊二百多只，牛十八头，马十六匹。火熄了，可是藏胞们的房子已被烧毁，怎么办呢？战士们就把帐篷给他们用，还发了一千多升糌粑面的救济粮。有一次，解放军战士马福安等在驻地巡逻的时候，发现水势汹涌地冲击着一条堤坝，坝上出现了缺口，而且缺口越来越大，眼看有被冲溃发生水灾的危险。于是，马福安首先奋不顾身跳下怒涛澎湃的激流中，用身体堵住堤坝缺口，另外两名解放军战士李福贵、赵宗秀眼看马福安一个人堵不住，也跟着跳下水去堵住缺口。
    直到大批军民闻讯赶来抢救堤坝时，他们三人的身体，已经被春天刚刚溶化的冰冷的雪水泡得发紫了。
    军民相处恰似乳水交融
    临别依依不舍争相远送
    由于人民解放军自进军西藏以来，就与西藏同胞建立了一天比一天深厚的情谊。因此，许多连队在换防时，驻地居民都依依不舍，争着要远道相送。有一次，驻在江孜附近一个村子的解放军某部移防时，驻地群众组织了一个欢送晚会，男女老少都穿上节日的盛装前来参加。当主席走上讲台，刚说完“恩人解放军要走了”，台下群众就哭泣起来，全连战士也都流下了热泪。讲话无法进行，只好开始献礼。群众送了许多酥油、哈达、鸡蛋，部队再三谢绝无效，最后只得收了一些，留作纪念。献礼后，军民手拉手围着篝火歌舞。第二天一早群众就在路旁相待，和战士们话别，男女青年争着为战士们背东西，老大妈们边走边说边哭，一直送了二十多里，还要坚持再送。经部队再三劝阻，他们才选派了六个男女代表，拉着骡马送了一天，部队到达新驻地时，他们才肯回家。像这类军民乳水交融的感人事例，在西藏是数不胜数的。
    目前，人民解放军平叛部队正在进一步发挥爱护西藏人民的传统，对被叛乱分子洗劫的西藏同胞给予救济，发给他们衣物和救济粮，解决了他们生活中的困难。当群众缺乏农具时，许多部队也设法发给他们锄头等农具。驻西藏广大官兵还利用战斗空隙给群众锄地、挑水、治病、扫地等。西藏同胞恨透了西藏叛国集团，他们许多人见到解放军就如大旱逢甘露，纷纷控诉叛匪的滔天罪行。西藏人民都说，解放军是“毛主席派来的菩萨兵”。藏族牧民向兽疫医疗队献哈达，感谢医疗人员给他们治愈了病畜。（附图片）
