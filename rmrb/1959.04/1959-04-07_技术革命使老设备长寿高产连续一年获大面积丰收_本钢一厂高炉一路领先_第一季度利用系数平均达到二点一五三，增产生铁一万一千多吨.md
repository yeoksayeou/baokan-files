Benxi, April 6th (By Our Own Correspondent) — The Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant, on the basis of vigorously launching mass movements, mobilized workers to boldly innovate technology and promoted an operational policy of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio in blast furnaces. This led to a straight-line increase in pig iron production, earning the plant the red flag for large-scale bumper harvests in large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide for twelve consecutive months. In the first quarter of this year, the average effective volume utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces reached 2.153, an increase of 17% compared to the annual average of 1.826 last year. After completing the first quarter pig iron production plan seven days ahead of schedule, the plant produced more than 11,300 tons of pig iron for the state.

The main reason this plant has maintained the high-yield red flag for twelve consecutive months is that, based on vigorously launching mass movements, the thinking of the workers has been liberated, and they have boldly improved the operating technology of the blast furnaces. The blast furnaces in this plant are all old equipment from forty years ago. Before April of last year, the highest utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces was only 1.39, and the production level lagged behind many key enterprises. In March of last year, under the encouragement of the rectification movement, the vast number of workers boldly broke through the shackles of conservative thinking, launched a great airing of views and a great debate on the question of why production was lagging behind, and resolved to remove the label of backwardness.

In the past, some people in this plant had always advocated maintaining a moderate smelting intensity operating policy in the blast furnaces. They believed that because the furnaces were old, a higher smelting intensity would lead to unsmooth furnace conditions, increased coke ratio, and damage to the furnace body. Not only would it fail to achieve the purpose of increasing production, but it would also lead to accidents involving furnace accretion. After a great debate, the majority of workers in the plant advocated changing this erroneous operating policy, and with the support of the Party organization, through bold experiments, they successively adopted a series of technical measures such as screening sintered ore, grading coke, improving the charging system, and increasing blast temperature. The smelting intensity of the blast furnaces was gradually increased from 1.013 at the beginning of last year to 1.4 to 1.5. With the realization of this major technical measure, the utilization coefficient of the plant's blast furnaces jumped to 1.546 in April of last year, exceeding the production level of advanced blast furnaces across the country at that time, and won the title of national blast furnace collective champion. By September of last year, the effective volume utilization coefficient of the plant's blast furnaces reached 2.077, and in October it was further increased to 2.245. Since then, the utilization coefficient of the plant's blast furnaces has remained at a high level above 2.1. After the smelting intensity was increased, due to the adoption of corresponding technical measures, the furnace conditions have been smooth, furnace accidents have not increased, and the coke ratio has not only not increased, but has decreased a lot compared to before.

In the process of promoting increased smelting intensity, the plant's Party committee, on the one hand, organized technical personnel and veteran workers to strengthen the experimental research on blast furnace operation, and on the other hand, mobilized workers of all trades other than blast furnaces to reform technical operations and carry out communist-style collaboration to overcome weak links in production. This created favorable conditions for the blast furnaces to continuously improve smelting intensity and ensured the large-scale bumper harvest of the blast furnaces. The workers in the sintering workshop, in order to ensure that the blast furnaces were well-fed, successively implemented methods such as screening the sintered ore and improving the charging, reducing the powder content of the sintered ore from the original 20% to 3%, and recently even to 0.5%. The daily output of sintered ore was gradually increased from the original three hundred tons to more than one thousand tons recently. The casting capacity of the original pig casting machine was very low, only able to cast 700 to 800 tons of pig iron per day. After the smelting intensity of the blast furnaces was increased, the daily output was increased to 1,600 tons. Recently, the workers have further increased the casting capacity, creating conditions for the blast furnaces to strive for a daily output of 2,000 tons. After the smelting intensity was increased, the raw material workers devised ways to increase the speed of the winding engine motor and increase the number of feedings, ensuring the needs of pig iron growth.

In order to put the high-yield red flag that they had won on an even higher peak, the iron smelting workers of Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant recently put forward a new leap forward target, determined to increase the utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces to 2.3 this year, and strive to reach 2.4. With this as a condition, they proposed that workers in iron smelting plants across the country launch friendly competitions. Since March, the workers have repeatedly created new records exceeding the 2.3 utilization coefficient target.

    技术革命使老设备长寿高产连续一年获大面积丰收
    本钢一厂高炉一路领先
    第一季度利用系数平均达到二点一五三，增产生铁一万一千多吨
    本报本溪6日电　本溪第一钢铁厂在大搞群众运动的基础上，发动职工大胆革新技术，在高炉上推行提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的操作方针，使生铁的产量直线上升，连续十二个月荣获全国大中型高炉大面积丰产的红旗。今年第一季度，高炉的有效容积利用系数平均达到二点一五三，比去年全年平均一点八二六提高了17％。全厂在提前七天完成第一季度生铁产量计划之后，又为国家多生产了一万一千三百多吨生铁。
    这个厂连续十二个月保持高产红旗，主要是由于在大搞群众运动的基础上，职工的思想得到解放，大胆改进了高炉的操作技术。这个厂的高炉，都是四十年以前的老设备。去年4月份以前，高炉利用系数最高只达到一点三九，生产水平落后于许多重点企业。在去年3月间，广大职工在整风运动的鼓舞下，大胆冲破保守思想的束缚，就生产为什么落后这个问题展开了大鸣大放大辩论，下定决心要摘掉落后帽子。
    过去，这个厂的一部分人一直主张在高炉上维持中等冶炼强度的操作方针。他们认为炉子老，较高的冶炼强度会使炉况不顺，焦比上升，造成炉体损坏，不仅不能达到增产的目的，反会发生高炉结瘤事故。经过大辩论，全厂大多数职工，主张改变这种错误的操作方针，并且在党组织的支持下，经过大胆试验，先后采用了烧结矿过筛、焦炭分级、改进装料制度和提高风温等一系列的技术措施，把高炉的冶炼强度由去年年初的一点零一三，逐步提高到一点四至一点五。随着这一重大技术措施的实现，全厂高炉的利用系数在去年4月份就一跃达到一点五四六，超过当时各地先进高炉的生产水平，荣获了全国高炉集体冠军的称号。到去年9月份，这个厂高炉的有效容积利用系数达到了二点零七七，10月份更提高到二点二四五。从那时以来，全厂高炉的利用系数就一直保持在二点一以上的高水平上。在冶炼强度提高以后，由于采取了相应的技术措施，炉况一直很顺，炉体事故没有增加，焦比不仅没有升高，反而比以前降低了很多。
    在推行提高冶炼强度的过程中，厂党委一面组织技术人员和老工人加强高炉操作的试验研究，一面发动高炉以外各工种的职工改革技术操作，开展共产主义大协作，克服生产薄弱环节。这样就为高炉不断提高冶炼强度创造了有利条件，保证了高炉的大面积丰产。团烧车间的职工，为了让高炉吃饱吃好，先后实行了烧结矿过筛和改进装料等方法，使烧结矿的粉末由原来的20％降低到3％，最近更降低到0.5％；烧结矿的日产量由原来的三百多吨逐步提高到最近的一千吨以上。原来铸铁机的铸铁能力很低，每天只能铸铁七百吨到八百吨，在高炉提高冶炼强度以后，日产量提高到一千六百吨。最近，工人们又把铸铁能力提高，为高炉力争日产二千吨创造了条件。冶炼强度提高以后，原料工人就设法提高卷扬机马达的转数，增加送料次数，保证了生铁增长的需要。
    本溪第一钢铁厂的炼铁职工，为了把夺得的高产红旗插上更高峰，不久前又提出了一个新的跃进指标，决心在今年内把高炉的利用系数提高到二点三，力争达到二点四，并以此为条件，倡议全国各炼铁厂职工开展友谊竞赛。3月份以来，职工们多次创造了超过利用系数二点三指标的新纪录。
