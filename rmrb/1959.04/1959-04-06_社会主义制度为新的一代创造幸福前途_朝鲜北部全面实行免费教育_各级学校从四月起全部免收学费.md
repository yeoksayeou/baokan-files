    Socialist System Creates a Happy Future for the New Generation
    North Korea Fully Implements Free Education
    All Levels of Schools Exempt from Tuition Fees Starting in April
    (Our dispatch from Pyongyang, April 5th) According to a recent decision by the North Korean Cabinet, all levels of schools in North Korea will be exempt from tuition fees starting April 1st. Currently, there are 2.38 million students in North Korea receiving education in over 7,000 schools without any financial burden.
    The North Korean Cabinet's decision on the full exemption of tuition fees points out that the comprehensive leap forward in the North Korean national economy and the growth of national accumulation have created conditions to guarantee students receive free education.
    Education in North Korea has greatly developed since liberation. There are now more than 4,300 primary schools, three times the number during the Japanese occupation. Before liberation, there were no universities in North Korea. Now there are more than 20. Currently, there is an average of one junior high school for every 1.7 *li* (approximately 0.85 km) in North Korea. Since November 1st of last year, the system of compulsory junior high school education has been fully implemented, and now tuition fees are fully exempted, giving every young person in North Korea ample opportunity to receive education.
    The full exemption of tuition fees has greatly inspired students and their parents. Song Douheng, a student in the Economics Department of Kim Il-sung University, said: The Labor Party and the Republic government have fully implemented the free education system, guaranteeing the right of all students to receive free education. He expressed his determination to achieve greater success in learning and productive labor to repay the care of the Party and the government. Li Jiuhao, a history student at the university, comes from South Korea. He said: In stark contrast to North Korea, there are many young people in South Korea who are deprived of the opportunity to receive education because they cannot afford tuition fees, wandering the streets, and some sell their blood to pay tuition fees and continue their schooling. He said: The full implementation of free education in North Korea will further inspire the people of South Korea to struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

    社会主义制度为新的一代创造幸福前途
    朝鲜北部全面实行免费教育
    各级学校从四月起全部免收学费
    本报平壤5日电　根据朝鲜内阁最近发布的决定，朝鲜各级学校从4月1日开始全部免收学费。现在朝鲜北部有二百三十八万名学生在七千多个学校里没有任何物质负担地受着教育。
    朝鲜内阁关于全部免收学费的决定中指出，由于朝鲜国民经济的全面跃进和国家积累的增长，创造了保证学生免费受教育的条件。
    朝鲜的教育在解放后有很大发展。现在有四千三百多个小学，等于日本统治时期的三倍，解放前朝鲜北部没有一所大学。现在有二十多所。现在朝鲜北部平均每一点七个里就有一所初中，从去年11月1日开始全面实行了初中义务教育制，现在又全面免收学费，这使得朝鲜北部的每个青少年都有充分的机会受到教育。
    全面免收学费给予学生和学生的家长们以很大的鼓舞。金日成综合大学经济系学生宋斗亨说：劳动党和共和国政府全面实行免费教育制，保障了全体学生免费受教育的权利。他表示决心要在学习和生产劳动中取得更大的成就，回答党和政府的关怀。这个大学的历史系学生李久浩的故乡是南朝鲜。他说：同朝鲜北部完全相反，南朝鲜有许许多多的青少年因为缴不起学费而被剥夺了受教育的机会，彷徨流浪在街头，有的出卖自己的血液来缴纳学费，维持上学。他说：朝鲜北部实行全面免费教育将进一步鼓舞南朝鲜人民为和平统一祖国而进行的斗争。
