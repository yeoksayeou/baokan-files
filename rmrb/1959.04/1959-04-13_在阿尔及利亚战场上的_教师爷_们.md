　　The "Teachers" on the Algerian Battlefield
　　Xu Ba
    In recent years, the heroic Algerian people have been advancing, while successive French cabinets, one after another, "heroes" commanding the colonial war, have collapsed under the feet of the Algerian people. Since November 1954, from Mendès-France, Faure, Mollet, Bourgès-Maunoury, Gaillard, Pflimlin to De Gaulle's Debré government, seven cabinets have been replaced; the figures wielding real power in the colonial war have also changed from Lionnet, Soustelle, Catroux, Lacoste, and Mute to the current Delouvrier and Challe, six times changing generals. These tragic butchers, without exception, were full of arrogance on the Algerian battlefield, always underestimating the strength of the Algerian people, even boasting that they could end the war in "a few weeks" or "the last quarter of an hour." But just like the "teacher" in the Chinese Peking opera "Fisherman's Revenge," after a period of bluster, they were beaten bloody, suffered losses, and retreated with their tails between their legs.
    The tragic end of French colonial governors and generals clearly reflects the process of French colonialists going from failure to greater failure on the Algerian battlefield.
    On November 1, 1954, with the sound of gunfire, the Algerian people's armed uprising broke out. The French ruling clique contemptuously dismissed the insurgents as merely a "disorganized rabble," a small number of "bandits" entrenched in the Aurès Mountains for a long time. General Lionnet, then serving as the Algerian Governor-General of the Mendès-France government, clamored to quell the "rebellion" in one fell swoop, increasing the number of troops by 40,000 (in addition to the existing 50,000), and carrying out "terrible revenge" against the overwhelmingly outnumbered insurgents. The colonialists' counterattack was undoubtedly fierce, and its cruelty was unprecedented. It is estimated that more than 48,000 Algerian residents were killed. However, the uprising not only defended strategic locations but also showed a prairie fire trend. Therefore, the French ruling group was in an uproar, with the fascist forces and right-wing politicians represented by Soustelle making the loudest noise. Within three months, Lionnet was replaced by the most fanatical fascist, Soustelle, and the Mendès-France government also collapsed.
    So, what about this arrogant new Governor-General Soustelle? His iron-fisted principle was "rapid," "ruthless," and "to eliminate them all." On the one hand, he implemented larger-scale searches, arrests, and massacres. On August 20, 1955, alone, he massacred 1,000 Algerian peaceful residents, and the prisons were overcrowded. The French army also drove large numbers of residents to concentration camps in the desert, called "resident centers." On the other hand, he increased the number of troops to 200,000 and carried out a "comprehensive suppression" of the National Liberation Army. "Pacification zones" were established in the Tizi Ouzou and Constantine areas. The Faure cabinet announced the implementation of the "state of emergency law" in Algeria. Soustelle was arrogant for a while, saying that he had "quickly contained" the uprising movement. However, with the support of the people, the National Liberation Army defended against the enemy, launched flanking attacks, and people everywhere rose up in rebellion, surging like a storm. Agence France-Presse reported in August 1955 that the Algerian people "launched extensive attacks in Constantine. The attacks were carried out in groups of 20 to 150 people. They used pickaxes, axes, knives, and even sticks. Some even participated in the attacks with their bare hands... These attacks were so fierce that the security forces (i.e., the French army) sometimes suffered heavy losses." Such arduous struggles finally shattered Soustelle's "comprehensive suppression" and expanded the war of liberation to the Tunisian and Moroccan borders and the northern coast. Soustelle, therefore, also turned into a stray dog, sadly admitting that the situation was "very turbulent."
    In early 1956, Mollet, the right-wing leader of the Socialist Party, came to power, and the defeated general Soustelle was dismissed. Mollet changed the position of Algerian Governor-General to a ministerial-level position, renamed it Minister Resident, and appointed Catroux as Minister Resident. Mollet's loyalty to the colonial cause was no less than his predecessor, but he offended the fascist colonial group in Algeria. A week after taking office, when Mollet "visited" Algeria, fascist elements held riots, throwing stones and rotten fruit at Mollet, shouting "Shoot Catroux." Mollet was forced to remove Catroux on the spot. Soon, Lacoste was appointed. This Lacoste served as Minister Resident for three consecutive cabinets of Mollet, Bourgès-Maunoury, and Gaillard for two years. His term was the longest, but his failure was also the most tragic.
    Lacoste learned from the lessons of Soustelle's failure in the "comprehensive suppression" and instead adopted the vicious policy of "zonal blockade" and "key encirclement and suppression." In order to protect the oil pipelines and railway lines transporting Sahara oil, 100,000 troops were stationed and thousands of fortresses were built. So-called "impenetrable" Morice Lines were also built on the Moroccan and Tunisian borders. This line was 300 kilometers long, half a kilometer wide, and defended by ten divisions. In addition, many "forbidden zones" or "no man's lands" were designated in many areas of Algeria, forcing residents in the area to move to so-called "regroupment camps" controlled by paratroopers. At the same time, the French government implemented the largest-scale mobilization since World War II, increasing the number of French troops stationed in Algeria from about 200,000 to about 600,000, plus 200,000 security forces, reaching a total of 800,000. The French National Assembly also authorized successive governments with "special powers" to deal with the Algerian issue, giving Lacoste unprecedented power over life and death.
    Reactionaries are reactionaries after all, and they are always unwilling to face reality. As soon as Lacoste took office, he boasted that he would win by "late summer"; after "late summer" passed, he said that the war had entered the stage of "the last quarter of an hour"; after "the last quarter of an hour" passed, he said that "the Algerian issue will be resolved in 1957." However, by November 1957, the Algerian national liberation movement had grown unprecedentedly. The liberated areas expanded to two-thirds of the country, and the National Liberation Army also developed to about 130,000 people. Lacoste's bragging became a laughing stock.
    In April 1958, Pflimlin came to power, and Mute served as Minister Resident. At this time, the French colonial war policy had reached a dead end, but a fascist storm of frenzied struggle was blowing. In May last year, fascist soldiers in Algeria launched a riot, and French bourgeois political parties, including the Mollet group of the Socialist Party, succumbed. Pflimlin made way for De Gaulle to come to power, and Mute only served as Minister Resident for two weeks. After De Gaulle formed a cabinet, he appointed himself Minister Resident of Algeria and delegated power to the Delegate General Salan to exercise. At the end of last year, he delegated political power to the Delegate General Delouvrier and military power to the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in Algeria, Challe. De Gaulle's arrogance is certainly not ordinary. As soon as he came to power, he clamored to "pacify Algeria" and to "restore stability in Algeria at all costs." Salan also clamored in July last year to "make the entire territory of Algeria orderly in the coming weeks." Indeed, since then, the French army has repeatedly launched frantic attacks. From August last year to January this year alone, the French army launched thirteen large-scale "sweeps." Not long ago, almost all mobile forces, about 120,000 people, were concentrated in northeastern Algeria for a nine-day "sweep." However, the fascist evil wind can overwhelm large and small pitiful "middle" parties and other spineless creatures, can bury the "Fourth Republic," but cannot stop the Algerian people who have stood up. The National Liberation Army repelled the frantic "sweeps," making De Gaulle's nine-day "sweep" a complete failure, and even the Morice Line was breached. The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic became a milestone in the Algerian national liberation war moving towards complete victory.
    The East wind prevails over the West wind, and the Algerian people can overwhelm French imperialism. The Algerian people, who are victoriously advancing in arduous battles, have received the support of freedom-loving people all over the world; their victory and heroic fighting spirit are encouraging millions of people on the African continent and other people suffering from colonial oppression to bravely rise up and fight for liberation. The just cause of the Algerian people is like the rising sun in the East, showing infinitely bright prospects; the French colonialists and their American accomplices are like the setting sun in the West, waiting for them is the tragic fate of complete failure!

　　在阿尔及利亚战场上的“教师爷”们
　　徐拔
    几年来，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民在前进，而一届一届的法国内阁，一个一个指挥殖民战争的“英雄”们，在阿尔及利亚人民的脚下垮了台。1954年11月以来，从孟戴斯—弗朗斯、富尔、摩勒、布歇—莫努里、盖伊阿、弗林姆兰到现在戴高乐的德勃雷政府，七换内阁；统揽殖民战争实权的人物也从利昂纳、苏斯戴尔、加特鲁、拉戈斯特、缪特到现在的德路弗里埃和夏耳，六次换将。这些悲剧式的屠夫们，在阿尔及利亚战场上无不气熖万丈，总是低估阿尔及利亚人民的力量，甚至夸口“几星期”、“最后一刻钟”就可以结束战争，但是正像中国京剧“打渔杀家”中的教师爷一样，在一阵耀武扬威之后，都被打得头破血流，损兵折将，夹着尾巴下台去了。
    法国殖民总督和将军们的这种悲惨下场，清楚地反映了法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚战场上从失败走向更大失败的过程。
    1954年11月1日，一声炮响，阿尔及利亚人民武装起义爆发了。法国统治集团竟轻蔑起义者只是“乌合之众”、长期盘踞在奥雷斯山区的少许“土匪”。当时担任孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府的阿尔及利亚总督利昂纳将军，叫嚷要一举敉平“叛乱”，增兵四万（原有五万），向众寡悬殊的起义者进行“可怕的报复”。殖民者的反扑不可谓不猛，其残酷亦属空前，据估计阿尔及利亚居民被杀四万八千多。然而，起义运动不仅固守了战略要地，而且显现了燎原之势。因此，法国统治集团哗然，以苏斯戴尔为代表的法西斯势力和右翼政客们鼓噪尤剧。不出三月，利昂纳换了最狂热的法西斯分子苏斯戴尔，孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府也倒了台。
    这个嚣张的新总督苏斯戴尔又如何呢？他的铁腕原则是“迅速”、“无情”、“最后一个消灭干净”。一方面实行更大规模搜查、逮捕和大屠杀。仅在1955年8月20日这一天就屠杀了一千个阿尔及利亚和平居民，监狱人满为患。法军还把大批居民赶到沙漠中的被称为“居民中心”的集中营。另一方面增兵至二十万，对民族解放军进行“全面进剿”。在蒂齐—乌佐和君士坦丁地区建立“绥靖区”。富尔内阁宣布在阿尔及利亚施行“紧急状态法”。苏斯戴尔骄横一时，说什么已“迅速遏制了”起义运动。然而，民族解放军在人民的支持下，据险抗敌，迂回出击，各地人民四处起义，风起云涌。法新社1955年8月报道说：阿尔及利亚人民“在君士坦丁广泛出击。进行袭击时都是二十人到一百五十人为一股。他们使用鹤嘴锄、斧头、刀子、甚至棍棒。有些人甚至赤手空拳地参加袭击……这些攻击如此激烈以致保安部队（即法军）有时遭到很大的牺牲。”如此艰苦的斗争，终于粉碎了苏斯戴尔的“全面进剿”，把解放战争扩大到了突尼斯和摩洛哥边境以及北部海岸。苏斯戴尔遂亦一变而为丧家之犬，黯然承认局势“十分动荡不安。”
    1956年初，社会党的右翼头子摩勒上台，败军之将苏斯戴尔被撤了职。摩勒把阿尔及利亚总督的职位改为部长级地位，并改称为驻节部长，任命加特鲁为驻节部长。摩勒效忠殖民主义事业不亚前任，但得罪了在阿尔及利亚的法西斯殖民集团。摩勒上任一星期后“访问”阿尔及利亚时，法西斯分子举行骚动向摩勒扔石块和烂水果，叫喊“枪毙加特鲁”。摩勒被迫当场撤掉了加特鲁。不久就任命了拉戈斯特。这个拉戈斯特连任摩勒、布歇—莫努里和盖伊阿三届内阁的驻节部长达两年之久。他的任期最长，但失败也最惨。
    拉戈斯特吸取了苏斯戴尔“全面进剿”失败的教训，改而采取“分区封锁”、“重点围剿”的恶毒的镇压政策。为了卫护输送撒哈拉石油的输油管和铁路交通线，驻扎了十万军队，并修建了上千座堡垒。在摩洛哥边境和突尼斯边境还建有被吹嘘为“不可突破的”摩里斯防线。这条防线全长三百公里，宽半公里，并有十个师防守。另外在阿尔及利亚许多地区又划了许多“禁区”或叫“无人地带”，强迫区内居民迁到由伞兵控制的所谓“重新集结营”去。同时法国政府实行了第二次世界大战以来最大规模的动员，把阿尔及利亚驻军人数从二十万左右增加到六十万左右，另加二十万保安部队，达八十万众。法国国民议会还授权历届政府以处理阿尔及利亚问题的“特别权力”，使拉戈斯特掌握了生杀予夺的空前权力。
    反动派到底是反动派，总不愿正视现实。拉戈斯特走马上任，就夸下海口，说到“夏末” 就能取胜；“夏末”过了，他又说战争已经进入“最后一刻钟”的阶段；“最后一刻钟”过去了，他又说“阿尔及利亚的问题将于1957年解决。”可是，到了1957年11月阿尔及利亚民族解放运动空前壮大了。解放区扩大到了全国三分之二的地区，民族解放军也发展到了十三万人左右。拉戈斯特的牛皮成了天下笑柄。
    1958年4月，弗林姆兰上台，缪特担任驻节部长。这时，法国殖民战争政策已走投无路，但刮起了疯狂挣扎的法西斯风暴。去年5月，在阿尔及利亚的法西斯军人发动暴乱，法国资产阶级政党包括社会党的摩勒集团，屈膝趋附。弗林姆兰为戴高乐上台让路，缪特只当了两个星期的驻节部长。戴高乐组阁后，自任阿尔及利亚驻节部长，而把权力委托给总代表萨兰来行使。去年底他又把政治方面的权力委托给总代表德路弗里埃，军事方面的权力委托给驻阿尔及利亚法军总司令夏耳。戴高乐的气焰当然不比平凡，一上台就叫嚷要“平定阿尔及利亚”，要“不惜一切代价在阿尔及利亚恢复安定。”萨兰在去年7月也叫嚣“在今后数星期内使阿尔及利亚全境秩序井然。”的确，自那以后，法军一再地发动疯狂进攻。仅从去年8月到今年1月，法军就发动了十三次大规模的“扫荡”。不久以前，更集中了几乎是全部机动兵力约十二万人在阿尔及利亚东北地区进行了为时九天的“扫荡”。但是，法西斯的妖风可以压倒大大小小可怜的“中间”党派和其他软骨虫，可以葬送“第四共和国”，但不能阻遏站起来了的阿尔及利亚人民。民族解放军击退了疯狂的“扫荡”，使戴高乐的九天“扫荡”一败涂地，连摩里斯防线也被突破了。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，成了阿尔及利亚民族解放战争走向完全胜利的里程碑。
    东风压倒西风，阿尔及利亚人民可以压倒法帝国主义。在艰苦战斗中胜利前进的阿尔及利亚人民，得到了全世界爱好自由人民的支持；他们的胜利和英勇战斗精神，正鼓舞着非洲大陆上的千千万万的人民和其他遭受殖民主义压迫的人民，奋勇而起，为争取解放而斗争。阿尔及利亚人民的正义事业正如东方早晨方升的太阳，展现着无限美好的前景；法国殖民者和他们的美国帮凶，正如西方下午没落的太阳，等待着他们的是彻底失败的悲惨命运！
