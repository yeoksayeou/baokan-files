　　“Silver Shuttle Weaver Girl”
　　When you walk into the weaving workshop of the Lanzhou Wool Textile Factory, you will see thousands of colorful big-character posters displayed everywhere. Among these big-character posters, many praise "Silver Shuttle Weaver Girl" Ni Aiqin.
　　Ni Aiqin only came to this factory last year. At first, she was assigned to the weaving workshop as an apprentice. On the first day, she followed the master worker to learn the technique. Seeing how easily the master worker worked, she wanted to try it herself. When the master was joining the yarn ends behind the machine, she started the machine. The shuttle ran only a few times before it popped out with a "bang."
　　After work, she didn't even eat dinner and went to the master to admit her mistake. The master said kindly, "You have to be careful and diligent in your work, study hard, practice hard, and use your brain more. You will learn it quickly." The master then patiently explained the principle of shuttle knotting to her. From then on, she learned during the day and thought at night, asking others whenever she didn't understand, asking whoever was available. In this way, she quickly mastered the driving skills.
　　One day, the workshop director asked her to operate the No. 19 machine alone. Ni Aiqin said embarrassedly, "How can I do that? What if the yarn breaks?" The workshop director repeatedly encouraged her, so she went. The first day she wove thirteen meters, which was considered smooth. But in the following days, difficulties always followed her, with yarn breaking or the machine stopping, and she couldn't complete the quota for several days. She was so anxious that she shed tears, which fell on the spinning machine. She suddenly woke up and said to herself, "How weak! Can a Communist Youth League member bow to difficulties?" So, she decided to find the cause of the yarn breaking, carefully studying the machine's temperament, and striving for speed in walking, joining ends, and changing shuttles, and operating meticulously. After that, the output quickly increased, rising from more than ten meters to twenty-six meters, and the quality also continuously improved.
　　In February of this year, the factory began trial-manufacturing paper wool fabric, and the workshop director asked Ni Aiqin to participate in the trial production. At first, she was a little timid, but she quickly learned techniques such as changing shuttles with both hands and handling broken ends without stopping the machine. As a result, the output rose sharply, creating a new record of 52.7 meters. The factory summarized and exchanged her advanced experience, and a production upsurge of "learning from Ni Aiqin, surpassing Ni Aiqin" was launched throughout the factory.
　　Ni Aiqin is now the production team leader of ten weaving machines. Seeing her skilled movements, who would believe that just a few months ago she was an ordinary woman who had never even seen a weaving machine? (Gan)

### “银梭织女”

　　“银梭织女”
    当你走进兰州毛纺织厂织造车间，就会看到千百张五颜六色的大字报张贴得琳琅满目。在这些大字报中，有很多是表扬“银梭织女”倪爱琴的。
    倪爱琴是去年才到这个工厂的。开始她被分配在织造车间当徒工。第一天跟着老师傅学技术，师傅工作起来那么得心应手，她想自己最好也能试一下。当师傅在车后面接头时，她便把车子开动了，梭子跑不了几下，就“砰”的一声蹦了出来。
    下班以后，她连饭也没有吃，就去找师傅承认错误。师傅和蔼地说：“工作要细心，要钻研，苦学苦练，多动脑筋，很快就会学会的。”师傅又耐心地给她解释了结梭的道理。从这以后，她白天学，晚上想，不懂的就去问别人，谁有空就问谁。这样，她很快地就掌握了开车技术。
    一天，车间主任要她到十九号车上去单独操作。倪爱琴为难地说：“这怎么行呢？纱头断了怎么办？”车间主任一再鼓励她，她便去了。第一天织了十三公尺，还算顺利。可是以后几天，困难老是跟着她，不是断头，便是停车，几天都完不成定额。她急得流下了眼泪，泪水落在纺机上，她猛地惊醒了，自己对自己说：“多软弱啊，一个共青团员难道能向困难低头吗？”于是，她下决心寻找断头的原因，细心地琢磨机器的脾气，在动作上做到走路快、接头快、换梭快，精心操作。这以后，产量很快提高了，由十多公尺上升到二十六公尺，而且质量也不断提高了。
    今年2月，这个厂开始试制造纸呢，车间主任要倪爱琴也参加试制工作。开始时，她还有些胆怯，但很快就学会了双手换梭、不停车处理断头等技术。这一来，产量直线上升，创造了五十二点七公尺的新纪录。厂里总结交流了她的先进经验，全厂掀起了“学倪爱琴，超倪爱琴”的生产热潮。
    倪爱琴现在已是十台织呢机的生产组长了。看到她那熟练的动作，谁会相信，在几个月前她还是个连织呢机都没有见过的普通妇女呢？　（甘）
