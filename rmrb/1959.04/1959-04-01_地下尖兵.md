    Underground Vanguard
    Wang Chongding
    In the Gaokeng Mine of the Pingxiang Coal Mine, when workers discuss the plan to produce 1.45 million tons this year, they invariably praise Haikou, saying, "With this brave and skilled underground vanguard, we can complete even more tasks." Underground vanguard! Who does this refer to? It refers to the tunneling team that constructs engineering roadways and marks out coal mining faces for the mining area. This year, when the Party issued the battle order to seize 380 million tons of coal, this tunneling team pushed the roadways forward underground at an even more extraordinary speed. They encountered many difficulties in the process, but they have long been accustomed to dealing with difficulties. The more difficulties they encounter, the faster their tunneling speed becomes.

    One day, team leader Yu Qidao was holding a pre-shift meeting with the workers when Captain Chen Huiguang walked in with a smile and said, "Folks! You've got another battle to fight!" "Fighting a battle" means accepting a difficult task again. Hearing this, Yu Qidao quickly stood up and roared in his rough voice, "Captain! Quickly give us the new task, lest we catch a cold from resting!" Chen Huiguang deliberately drawled, "Don't be impatient! The mine has given us an urgent task: starting tomorrow, you have to complete the 112th return air duct and the 110th electric chute roadway within fifteen days. If these two roadways are not completed on time, the Second Mining District will not have a new working face for coal mining! At that time, you won't deserve to be called the vanguard of 380 million!" Drilling rig operator Gao Qichun patted his chest and said, "Captain! Don't worry about this. The leadership wants us to complete the task in fifteen days, and we will definitely not take fifteen days and one minute. We might even finish ahead of schedule!" Chen Huiguang nodded and said, "However, this task is very arduous. There is standing water on the floor of the 110th electric chute roadway, and it's a downhill slope, so the water follows the stope. The roof pressure is also high. Saying it doesn't count, doing it is what matters. Let's see if you have the confidence to complete this task?" A tunneling worker stood up and patted his chest, saying, "Captain, when have we ever delayed the mining area? As long as their appetite is big enough, they are guaranteed to have enough to eat."

    The battle began on the first day. According to the fifteen-day calculation, each of the two stopes had to advance 3.5 meters per day, but they each advanced more than 5 meters every day. The tunneling workers working on the 110th electric chute roadway had to deal with a low roadway, with the highest point being only 1.4 meters high, and there was also a lot of water in the roadway. However, they didn't have time to pump the water out, so they soaked their feet in the water while drilling holes. Sometimes the water wet their clothes, and they would wring them out with their hands and then continue working. Because the roadway was low, it was difficult to use flatcars, so they relied entirely on the young workers lying on their sides to drag coal and materials, soaking their clothes.

    On the eighth day, seeing that the two young workers, Yu Huamao and Tao Weichun, were working too hard, team leader Yu Qidao discussed a solution with everyone. Tunneling worker Gao Qichun said, "How about this: we transfer Yu Huamao and Tao Weichun to the stope with better conditions for a few days, and we internally adjust the labor organization. I'll be a rough worker and drag coal for a few days." Foreman Lin Xiquan, afraid of not having a job, quickly chimed in, "I'll do one too! I'll do one too! I can operate the drilling rig and carry coal, one person doing two jobs, is that okay?" Team leader Yu Qidao happily said, "That's great! That's great!" When Yu Huamao and Tao Weichun heard that they were going to be transferred to the stope with better conditions, they requested the team leader, "We're not going. Retreating when we encounter difficulties, what kind of underground vanguard would that make us?" Team leader Yu Qidao deliberately gave them a dressing down, saying, "If you don't go, that's called being unorganized and undisciplined!" Some people also joked from the side, "Go and rest for a few days! We have plenty of 'battles' to fight this year! Maybe there will be even more important tasks waiting for you soon!" Only then were the two men reluctantly leave this difficult stope and go to another stope.

    After the battle force was adjusted, team leader Yu Qidao also helped to drag coal. Everyone in the team, seeing that the team leader and the foreman were taking the lead in carrying materials and dragging coal, became even more motivated.

    In this way, the advance speed increased day by day. They completed the two roadways in ten days, ahead of schedule.

    A Soviet tunnel worker once said, "As long as the Party gives an order, we will dig to the center of the earth!" Today, the Party has issued the battle order to seize 380 million tons of coal, and we, these underground coal mining vanguards, are responding to the Party's call with our own hands, wisdom, and a burning red heart, demanding coal from the earth.

    地下尖兵
    王崇鼎
    在萍乡煤矿的高坑矿，工人们一谈论起今年年产一百四十五万吨的计划，就离不了要夸几句海口说：“有了这支神勇善战的地下尖兵，再多一些任务，也能完成。”地下尖兵！这是指谁呢？就是指为采煤区做工程巷道和划采煤工作面的掘进队。今年，当党发出要夺取三亿八千万吨煤的战斗令后，这支掘进队更以出奇的速度在地底下把巷道向前推进。这当中，是碰到许多困难的，可是，他们长期和困难打交道打惯了，越是碰到困难，他们掘进速度越快。
    这一天，组长余启道正和工人在开进班会，忽然队长陈辉光笑嘻嘻的走来说：“伙计！你们又有仗打了！”“打仗”，这是意味着又要接受困难任务了。余启道听得这一说，忙站起来，扯开他那粗嗓子说：“队长！有什么新任务快些交给我们吧，免得我们歇着受凉呀！”陈辉光故意拉长声音说：“莫性急呀！矿上交来了一个紧急任务：从明天起，要你们在十五天的时间内，打通一百一十二回风道和一百一十电溜子道，这两个巷道不按期打通，回采二区就没有新工作面采煤啦！到那时，你们就不配称为三亿八的尖兵了！”风钻掘进工高其春拍拍胸膛说：“队长！这个你放心，领导上要我们十五天完成任务，我们决不要十五天零一分钟，说不定还要来一个提前！”陈辉光点点头说：“不过，这次的任务很艰巨呀，一百一十电溜子道底板有积水，又是下坡，水跟挡头走，顶板压力又大。说了不算，做了再看，看你们有没有信心完成这个任务？”一个掘进工站起来拍拍胸膛说：“队长，我们那回说过采煤区的事？只要他们的胃口大，保险他们有得吃。”
    战斗在第一天就打响了。按十五天计算，两个挡头每天要各进三公尺五，可是，每天都各进了五公尺多。战斗在一百一十电溜子道工作的掘进工，因为巷道矮，最高的地方只有一公尺四高，巷道里又有很深的水，可是，他们没有工夫打水，就把两只脚泡在水里打钻眼，有时水弄湿了衣服，他们用手扭干一下，接着又开始干。由于巷道矮，不好用小平车，全靠小工侧卧着拖煤拖料，积水把衣服弄得一身湿。
  第八天，大家看到余华茂和陶维春两个小工太辛苦，组长余启道就和大家商量办法。掘进工高其春说：“这样吧：把余华茂和陶维春调到条件好的挡头去工作几天，我们内部把劳动组织调整一下，我来担任一个粗工，拖几天煤。”大工林锡泉生怕没有他的差事，忙争着说：“我也来一个！我也来一个！我又打风钻又抱煤，一员兼两职，行不行？”组长余启道高兴地说：“这太好了！这太好了！”余华茂和陶维春听说要调换他们两人到条件好的挡头去，请求组长说：“我们不去，碰到困难就退缩，这还能算什么地下尖兵。”组长余启道故意来一个下马威说：“你们不去，这就叫做无组织，无纪律！”有的人也在旁边打趣的说：“你们去休整几天吧！我们今年有的是‘仗’打呀！说不定不久还有更重要的任务等着你们呢！”这样，他俩人才勉强离开这个困难挡头，到别个挡头去了。
    战斗力量调整后，组长余启道也帮着拖煤。全组的人看见组长、大工都带头抱料拖煤，劲头更足了。
    就这样，进尺速度一天快一天他们以十天的时间就提前打通了这两个巷道。
    苏联一个隧道工说过：“只要党下一个命令，我们就打到地球中心去！”如今，党发出了夺取三亿八千万吨煤的战斗令，我们这些地底下的采煤尖兵们，就是这样以自己的双手、智慧和一颗烈火红心，响应党的号召，向地球要煤炭。
