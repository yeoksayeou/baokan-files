    I Won't Emulate Zhao Dahua
    Beijing Dongzongbu Hutong Zhang Xiaonan
    Uncle Zhang Tianyi's book "Stories of Not Using One's Brain" is really funny! I laughed as I read it, my stomach hurting from laughing. Every time I saw the child drawn on the cover, with his two legs stuck in one trouser leg, I couldn't help but laugh. That child is called Zhao Dahua, and he makes so many jokes because he doesn't like to use his brain. His sister and classmates were doing a chemistry game, and they needed to weigh half a *gongfen* of something. Without hearing the whole thing, he ran to carry a large coal scale. He didn't even think about what it was for. He forgot the big scale weight on the bed, and when he went to bed at night, it hurt all over, but he didn't even think about why, just shouting for a doctor. He wanted to go fishing the next day but was too lazy to remember the time himself, so he asked his sister to remember it for him, truly a lazy little bum who doesn't like to use his brain! He got up in the morning to get dressed, and his two legs went into one trouser leg. Of course, he fell when he walked. He didn't even think about why, and he should have been flicked on the nose a few times. He even cried that he had lost a leg! In the end, he didn't even remember his own house number. He ran to an old woman's house and was even surprised that his sister had turned into an old woman. Tell me, isn't Zhao Dahua muddle-headed!
    I told my mother this story, and she asked me if I had ever seen such a child. I didn't believe there was such a muddle-headed child, it was just a story! My mother said, "I have seen such children." I asked who, and my mother pointed at my nose and told me to think. I thought about it, and my mother meant me. That's right, I'm a bit like Zhao Dahua. I love helping my mother with chores, and she often praises me for being diligent, but she always says I don't use my brain. Once, my younger brother was sick, and my mother asked me to get a small spoon to give him medicine. I only heard the words "get a spoon" and ran to the kitchen and brought back a large iron spoon for serving rice. My mother asked me to buy oil, and I ran to the cooperative without taking the oil bottle. Things like this happen a lot. I said to my mother, "I know who you're talking about, but I definitely won't emulate Zhao Dahua."

    我不学赵大化
    北京东总布胡同　张小南
    张天翼伯伯写的“不动脑筋的故事”这本书真逗！我一边读，一边笑，笑得肚子疼。我一看见封面上画的那个小孩，两条腿伸到一个裤筒里，我就憋不住，非笑不可。那个小孩叫赵大化，因为不爱动脑筋，闹的笑话可多啦。他妹妹和同学做化学游戏，要称半公分东西，话没听完，他就跑去扛了一杆称煤的大秤，他也不想想是称什么东西的。他把大秤锤放在床上忘记了，夜里上床睡觉梗得浑身疼，他也不想想这是怎么回事，就嚷着请医生。他想第二天去钓鱼，自个可懒得记时间，叫妹妹给记住，真是个不爱动脑筋的小懒汉！早上起来穿衣服，两条腿伸到一个裤筒里，一走路，当然要摔跤啦，他也不想想那是怎么回事，真该刮他两下鼻子，还哭着自个少了一条腿哩！最后，他连自己的家门都不记得了，跑到一个老婆婆家门口，还奇怪妹妹怎么会变成老婆婆了。你们说，赵大化糊涂不糊涂！
    我把这个故事讲给妈妈听，妈妈问我见过这样的小孩没有？我才不信真有这样糊涂的小孩呢，这是讲故事呗！妈妈说：“我可见过这样的孩子。”我问是谁，妈妈指指我的鼻子，叫我想想。我想了想，妈妈是说我哩。可不是么，我有点像赵大化呢。我顶爱帮妈妈做事，妈妈常夸我勤快，但也老说我不用脑子。有次弟弟病了，妈妈叫我拿个小杓给弟弟吃药，我只听到“拿杓”两个字，跑到厨房把盛饭的大铁杓拿来了。妈妈叫我买油，我油瓶子不提就跑到合作社。这种事可多啦。我对妈妈说：“我知道你说的是谁，反正我不学赵大化。”
