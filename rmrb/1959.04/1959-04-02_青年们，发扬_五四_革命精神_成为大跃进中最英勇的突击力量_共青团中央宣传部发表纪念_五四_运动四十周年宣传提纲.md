Xinhua News Agency, April 1st. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League published a publicity outline on March 31st to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement.

The outline said that this year's May 4th marks the 40th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. Young people across the country are welcoming this glorious festival with infinite joy and excitement. Commemorating the "May Fourth" in a year of decisive significance in the three years of hard struggle has major political significance.

The first part of the outline introduces the course and significance of the May Fourth Movement. The outline stated that the May Fourth Movement marked a leap in the Chinese revolution from the old democratic stage to the new democratic stage. The May Fourth Movement had epoch-making significance for the development of the Chinese revolutionary cause.

The second and third parts of the outline call on young people to inherit and carry forward the spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement, to devote themselves to the great cause of building socialism with full enthusiasm, to strive to implement the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and to strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. It also calls on young people to play a vanguard role in the current technical revolution and cultural revolution. The outline states that this year's tasks are grand, but also very arduous. As long as we muster greater revolutionary vigor and, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, carry out heroic, diligent, and creative labor, we will surely be able to victoriously realize this year's greater leap forward. Our young people should, as the Party calls on us, like the revolutionary pioneers of the "May Fourth," carry forward the strongest revolutionary spirit, go to the most difficult places in the revolutionary cause, go to the most urgently needed places, and become the most heroic shock force in the Great Leap Forward.

The outline states that to make our construction undertakings more, faster, better, and more economical, we must combine hard work with clever work. A large-scale technical revolution movement has already begun across the country. Young people in our country should give full play to their wisdom and talents and take the lead in this movement. Young workers should focus on the key to production, actively improve design, equipment, and operating methods, increase the degree of mechanization and automation, continuously improve labor productivity, and strive to cultivate themselves into versatile talents who are "proficient in one specialty and capable in many." Young peasants should focus on the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, conscientiously study and master agricultural science and technology knowledge, vigorously carry out tool reforms, and promote the mechanization and electrification of agriculture. All young people with the necessary conditions should strive to learn and master cutting-edge science and technology according to the needs of the country.

In order to give our country a highly developed modern scientific culture and gradually eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor, young people in our country should inherit and carry forward the spirit of the "May Fourth" cultural revolution, and, under the leadership of the Party, devote themselves to the current cultural revolution movement with greater learning enthusiasm. The 10 million students in school across the country should continue to strive for a triple harvest of study, labor, and thought under the leadership of the Party and with the help of teachers. While engaging in heroic labor, the vast number of young workers and peasants should continue to improve their cultural and scientific knowledge through spare-time study, continuously and tenaciously. Young people who are still illiterate should strive to get rid of illiteracy as soon as possible; young people who have already become literate should actively participate in spare-time elementary and secondary school studies to continue to consolidate and improve their cultural level; young people who already have a secondary education should also continue to study on their own or enter spare-time universities to strive to improve to the level of junior colleges.

The fourth part of the outline emphasizes that intellectuals must inherit the glorious tradition of the May Fourth Movement and integrate themselves with the workers and peasants. The outline states that intellectuals must combine with the workers and peasants, which is the glorious tradition of the May Fourth Movement. In today's period of peaceful construction, participating in physical labor is of decisive significance for cultivating young intellectuals in our country into construction talents who are both red and expert. To conscientiously implement this policy, we must make further efforts and engage in much ideological struggle and arduous training. However, as long as we are determined and bravely throw ourselves into the crucible of labor, we can forge ourselves into steel-like warriors and become promising successors to the revolutionary pioneers.

The final part of the outline points out that this generation of young people in our country has grown up under the care and teaching of the Party. It is precisely because the Party has given us everything that young people in our country can become vanguards in revolutionary struggles and a shock force in socialist construction. Therefore, loving the Party, striving to safeguard the interests of the Party, and resolutely obeying the leadership of the Party have become the most important things in the entire life of young people in our country. Young people across the country must consciously obey the leadership of the Party. At the same time, they should strive to improve their communist consciousness, firmly establish a world outlook of serving the people, and cultivate themselves into true communists. In addition, young people should also strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, study the Party's policies and guidelines, and improve their political and theoretical level, thereby enhancing their consciousness in work. The outline also calls on young people to carry forward the spirit of internationalism, strengthen the unity of the people of the world, develop the profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, strive to safeguard the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, oppose the aggression and oppression of the people of all countries by the imperialist camp headed by US imperialism, support the liberation struggles of all oppressed classes and oppressed nations in the world, and resolutely oppose the conspiracy of the Yugoslav revisionists to split the socialist camp and the international communist movement.

The outline concludes by saying that the Party places great expectations and care on our younger generation. On the occasion of commemorating the 40th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, young people of all ethnic groups in our country must carry forward the anti-imperialist and patriotic spirit of the "May Fourth" predecessors, strive to consolidate the leadership of the Party and the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and play a greater shock role and vanguard role in the current socialist construction, so as not to fail the expectations of the Party and the people.

    青年们，发扬“五四”革命精神
    成为大跃进中最英勇的突击力量
    共青团中央宣传部发表纪念“五四”运动四十周年宣传提纲
    新华社1日电　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会宣传部3月31日发表了纪念五四运动四十周年的宣传提纲。
    提纲说，今年的5月4日，正值五四运动四十周年。全国青年以无限欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接这个光辉的节日。在苦战三年具有决定性的一年来纪念“五四”，更有着重大的政治意义。
    提纲的第一部分介绍了五四运动的经过及其意义。提纲说，五四运动使中国革命由旧民主主义阶段跃进到新民主主义阶段。五四运动对中国革命事业的发展，有着划时代的重大意义。
    提纲的第二和第三部分中号召青年继承和发扬“五四”运动的精神，满腔热情地投身到建设社会主义的伟大行列中去，努力贯彻党的八届六中全会的决议，为实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗，并且要求青年在当前的技术革命和文化革命运动中起先锋作用。提纲说，今年的任务是宏伟的，但也是十分艰巨的。只要我们鼓足更大的革命干劲，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，进行英勇的、勤恳的、创造性的劳动，就一定能够胜利地实现今年的更大跃进。我们青年应该像党所号召的那样，像“五四”革命先辈那样，发扬最坚强的革命精神，到革命事业最艰苦的地方去，到最急需的地方去，成为大跃进中一支最英勇的突击力量。
    提纲说，要使我们的建设事业做得多快好省，还必须把苦干和巧干结合起来。现在一个规模巨大的技术革命运动，已经在全国各地开展起来。我国青年应当充分发挥自己的智慧和才能，走在这个运动的前头。青年工人应当围绕生产关键，积极改进设计、设备和操作方法，提高机械化、自动化的程度，不断地提高劳动生产率，并且努力把自己培养成为“一专多能”的多面手；青年农民应当围绕农业“八字宪法”，认真学习和掌握农业科学技术知识，大搞工具改革，促进农业的机械化和电气化；一切有条件的青年，都应该根据国家需要努力学习和掌握尖端科学技术。
    为了使我国具有高度发展的现代科学文化，并且逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，我国青年应当继承并发扬“五四”文化革命的精神，在党的领导下，以更高的学习热情，投入当前的文化革命运动。全国一千万在校学生，应该继续在党的领导和教师的帮助下，争取做到读书、劳动、思想三丰收。广大工农青年在英勇劳动的同时，应该继续通过业余学习，不断地顽强地去提高自己的文化科学知识。现在还是文盲的青年，应当争取尽早地摘掉文盲帽子；已经脱盲的青年，应当积极参加业余高小和业余中学学习，继续巩固和提高自己的文化水平；现在已经具有中等教育程度的青年，也应当继续自学或进入业余大学学习，努力提高到大专学校的程度。
    提纲的第四部分强调知识分子必须继承五四运动的光荣传统，同工农群众相结合。提纲说，知识分子必须和工农群众相结合，这是五四运动的光荣传统。在今天和平建设时期，参加体力劳动对于把我国知识青年培养成为又红又专的建设人才，具有决定性的意义。要认真贯彻这个方针，必须作进一步的努力，要作许多的思想斗争和艰苦的磨练，但是，只要下定决心，勇敢地投身到劳动的熔炉中去，就能够把自己锻炼成钢铁般的战士，作革命先辈的有出息的接班人。
    提纲的最后部分指出，我国这一代青年是在党的抚育和教导下成长起来的。正是因为党给了我们一切，我国青年才能成为革命斗争中的尖兵，成为社会主义建设中的一支突击队。因此，热爱党，努力维护党的利益和坚决服从党的领导，就成为我国青年全部生活中最主要的事情。全国青年要作到自觉地服从党的领导。同时，应当努力提高自己的共产主义觉悟，牢固地树立为人民服务的人生观，把自己培养成一个真正的共产主义者。除此，青年们还应该努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，学习党的方针政策，提高政治理论水平，从而增强工作中的自觉性。提纲还要求青年们发扬国际主义精神，加强全世界人民的团结，要发展中苏两国人民的深厚友谊，努力维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营对各国人民的侵略和压迫，支持全世界一切被压迫阶级和被压迫民族的解放斗争，并且坚决地反对南斯拉夫修正主义者分裂社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的阴谋活动。
    提纲最后说，党对我们青年一代寄予极大的期望和关怀。在纪念五四运动四十周年的时候，我国各族青年必须发扬“五四”先辈的反帝爱国精神，努力巩固党的领导和国内各族人民的团结，在当前社会主义建设中发挥更大的突击作用和先锋作用，以不辜负党和人民的期望。
