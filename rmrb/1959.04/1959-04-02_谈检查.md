    Talking About Inspection
    Wu Lü
    The two characters "implement" have recently attracted the attention of many comrades. This is a good phenomenon, indicating that our economic work is indeed becoming more and more meticulous. However, it is not easy to truly implement things, to make sure one is one and two is two, that nothing is missed, and that everything achieves the expected results. In addition to ensuring that work tasks and work plans are correctly proposed, effective measures must also be taken in organizational leadership. Inspection is an important one of these.
    For example, let's say we are producing dozens of sets of rolling mills. If we only hold a meeting and make a simple arrangement, it is clear that this is not implementation. If it is not just a general arrangement, but also a specific study and determination of who produces the main engine, who produces the parts, who manages the raw materials, who organizes the complete sets, how many sets are produced this month, and how many sets are produced next month, with arrangements for everything, this is obviously more implementation. But this is only the arrangement for production. To ensure the completion of the production plan on schedule, it is also necessary to promptly solve many specific problems that occur in production. To actively discover these problems and solve these problems, inspection is needed. Without inspection, even if the work is arranged very specifically, and it seems to be implemented, there is still a possibility of failure.
    Because for any matter, although we foresee its development trend in advance based on general laws, and take practical measures in the organization, it is impossible to foresee every detail in the process of its development in advance and arrange everything without error. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly inspect the work, discover problems, and solve problems. Without inspection, if you are unaware of the new problems in the actual work, and the measures cannot keep up, how can you not fail?
    Our economic work is becoming more and more meticulous. Now, everyone talks about implementation, and everything talks about implementation. But implementation can never be achieved once and for all; it is not "implement once, and everything is fine." We must grasp the weapon of inspection, constantly discover new problems in the development of work, constantly take measures, and constantly implement. For comrades who do economic work, mastering the weapon of inspection is particularly important. Economic work is a very complex and meticulous work, and various departments, various products, and various links are interconnected. A slight negligence in one link will affect a series of links. Therefore, we must be diligent in inspection, not waiting for problems to come to you, but you go to find problems, so that we can take timely measures to solve problems, and this can be considered truly implemented.
    Now is the beginning of the second quarter, and a greater battle has begun. Many places have established command headquarters and set up inspectors and special commissioners. This approach is very worthy of promotion and greatly facilitates the concentration of forces to break through key points. The news from Lüda City published in this newspaper today is an example. If you pay attention to implementation, you must pay attention to inspection. Inspection is an important guarantee of implementation. This is a problem that should be paid close attention to in the current economic work.

    谈检查
    吴滤
    “落实”二字，近来已经引起了许多同志的注意。这是一个好现象，表明我们的经济工作，确是越作越细致了。然而，做事情真正落实，一是一、二是二，桩桩不落空，事事都得到预期的效果，却很不易。这除了工作任务、工作计划要提的正确之外，还需要在组织领导上采取有效的措施。检查就是其中重要的一条。
    譬如说，生产几十套轧钢机。如果光开一个会，简单地布置一下，这显然是没有落实。如果不光是一般的布置，而且还具体研究和确定了谁生产主机、谁生产配件、谁管原材料、谁组织配套、这个月生产几套、下个月生产几套，一一都有了安排，这显然是比较落实了。但这也只是生产的安排，要保证生产计划如期完成，还要及时解决生产中发生的许多具体问题。3要主动发现这些问题，解决这些问题，就需要检查。没有检查，尽管工作布置得很具体，看起来落实了，结果还有可能落空。
    因为对任何一件事，尽管我们在事先根据一般规律预见到它的发展趋势，在组织上采取切实的措施，却不可能在事先洞察事物发展过程中的每一个细节，安排得万无一失。因此就需要不断地对工作进行检查，发现问题，解决问题。没有检查，对实际工作发展中的新问题心中无数，措施跟不上去，怎么能不落空呢？
    我们的经济工作是愈做愈细致了。现在是事事讲落实、人人讲落实。但落实决不可能一劳永逸，“一次落实，万事大吉”。我们一定要掌握检查这个武器，不断发现工作发展中的新问题，不断采取措施，不断地落实。对于做经济工作的同志，掌握检查这个武器特别重要。经济工作是一个很复杂很细致的工作，各个部门，各种产品，各个环节之间都是相互影响的。一个环节上稍有疏忽，就会影响到一连串的环节。因此就必须勤于检查，不让问题来找你，而是你去找问题，这样就可以及时采取措施，解决问题，这才算真正落实了。
    现在是第二季度的开始，一场更伟大的战斗揭开了。许多地方都成立了指挥部，设立了检查员、特派员，这种作法，很值得提倡，大大有利于集中力量，突破重点。今天本报发表的旅大市的新闻就是一例。注意了落实，就要注意检查，检查是落实的一个重要保证，这是当前经济工作中要十分注意的问题。
