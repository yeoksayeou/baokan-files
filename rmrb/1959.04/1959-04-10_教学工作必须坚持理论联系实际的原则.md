Teaching Work Must Adhere to the Principle of Integrating Theory with Practice

Guo Yingqiu, President of Nanjing University

Combining education with productive labor and linking theory with practice is a major revolution in Chinese education

Linking theory with practice is the primary method of learning and a principle that we must adhere to in our teaching work. The Central Committee's instructions on education correctly point out that "professing courses must thoroughly implement the principle of linking theory with practice." For thousands of years, education has been separated from labor and from reality. Today, combining education with productive labor and linking theory with practice is indeed a major revolution in Chinese education. Since last autumn, we have achieved significant successes in this revolutionary struggle in some fundamental issues, such as the Party's leadership, the mass line in teaching work, the combination of education with productive labor, and changing social customs. However, many problems still exist, and resolving these problems thoroughly requires continued and unremitting effort.

Old university education primarily transmitted and studied indirect experience, fundamentally neglecting direct experience. Students, once they entered school, were completely isolated from productive practice and social life practice. Even if they did some educational or production internships, they were only superficial and could not solve the principle of integrating theory with practice. Students learned only book knowledge. Some of this book knowledge was correct, and some was incorrect. Even if all their knowledge was the truth, it was "the theory written by their predecessors summarizing the experience of production struggle and class struggle, not the knowledge they obtained themselves." (Mao Zedong) This kind of knowledge can only be partial knowledge. How to apply this knowledge to life and reality becomes a problem.

After implementing the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor," the teaching work of universities is undergoing profound changes. Most teachers and students are no longer isolated from social life but closely observe its development; they no longer despise productive labor but include it in the educational plan. Through participating in industrial and agricultural productive labor, field work, and social voluntary labor, they not only strengthened their ideological training and created material wealth but also, to a certain extent, consolidated and improved their professional knowledge. At this point, what is taught in universities is no longer purely indirect experience, and what students learn is no longer just book knowledge. Labor has changed the face of teaching work, and labor has begun to enable teachers and students to have the ability to apply what they have learned. We believe that this is the correct path to cultivate "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture."

Basic Courses and Professional Courses Must Implement the Principle of Integrating Theory with Practice

After more than half a year of exploration, three issues have become clear in terms of basic theoretical courses: the proportion of study hours, the integration with productive labor, and the content and teaching methods of the courses.

The boundary between basic courses and professional courses is easier to define for some majors and more difficult for others. The old teaching plan stipulated that the proportion of basic courses and professional courses in the total study hours should be 40% to 60%, which was very necessary; however, the proportion of political courses accounted for only about 10%, which was inappropriate. After studying the Party's education policy, the proportion of political courses rose to 15% to 20%, which led to a question: should basic theoretical courses be reduced or should specialized courses and elective courses be appropriately adjusted while keeping the total study hours roughly unchanged? After debate and experimentation, the proportion of various courses was stipulated as follows: political courses account for 15% to 20% of the total study hours, basic courses and professional courses account for 50% to 65%, and specialized courses and elective courses account for 10% to 25% (originally 16% to 34%). This strengthened political courses and appropriately increased the proportion of basic courses and professional courses, while also making necessary adjustments to specialized courses and elective courses according to different majors. We believe that this arrangement is more appropriate.

Whether basic theoretical courses can be combined with production and reality is a matter of debate. Some people emphasize the systematicness and logicality of basic theory, affirming that it cannot be combined with production and reality; others believe that theory comes from practice, and productive labor can completely replace experiments. Both of these views are one-sided. We believe that theory is the direct experience of predecessors or foreign regions, and its systematicness should be respected, but "the only true theory in the world is the theory drawn from objective reality and proven in objective reality." (Mao Zedong) If theory is mystified and conceptualized and not allowed to be proven in objective reality, then this "theory" becomes a lifeless corpse, useless now and without any future development. Conversely, if theory is applied to practice, it can not only promote the development of production and life but also further consolidate and develop theoretical knowledge in practice. Physics students combine their major with the production of ferrite, and mathematics and astronomy students use mathematical and astronomical theory to manufacture astronomical telescopes, and they all have profound experiences in this regard. But this does not mean that the scientific theoretical system can be arbitrarily split, and that as long as "you learn what you do," there is no need to engage in systematic theoretical learning. A certain unit once conducted two kinds of experiments in the teaching of basic theoretical courses: one was to only teach theory without conducting experiments, using productive labor to replace experiments; the other was to only teach the technological process without teaching theory, and then supplement the theory after productive labor. Both experiments were not very effective, and it was actually another form of separation of theory from practice. The conclusion is that basic theoretical courses must still be conducted systematically, experimental courses must also be done seriously, and productive labor can replace part of the experiments but cannot completely replace them.

In order to reflect the principle of integrating theory with practice in basic theory teaching, the course content and teaching methods must also be changed accordingly. In the past, basic courses and professional courses were multi-disciplinary and unrelated to each other. Teachers who taught public basic courses only cared about the theoretical system of their own discipline, and did not understand or care about the theoretical system of professional courses. From the perspective of the teacher, what he taught was indeed systematic and complete, but from the perspective of the student, because there were many clues and each was reasonable, it took twice the effort to accept and digest various different theoretical systems. Therefore, not only should attention be paid to the interrelationships of concurrent courses in the curriculum arrangement, but also the content of mutually related disciplines should take care of each other, eliminating unnecessary repetitions and adding mutually clarifying materials; deleting excessively outdated content and teaching the latest scientific achievements. In this way, better teaching results will be obtained in the same teaching hours. In order to solve this problem, we have begun to try two methods: one is that teachers of professional courses also teach basic courses, such as teachers of the biology department also teach mathematics of their major; the other is to organize teachers of public basic courses to supplement certain professional courses, such as mathematics teachers supplementing physics or geology of the major they teach. The former method seems to be more effective, while the latter method is more in line with the actual situation of today's lack of teachers.

Reasonably Arrange the Proportion of "Ancient" and "Modern" Courses, Learn to Use Indigenous and Foreign Methods to Conduct Experiments and Production Internships

In the past, in teaching and scientific research, the phenomenon of emphasizing the ancient over the modern, valuing the foreign over the Chinese, and only using foreign methods without indigenous ones was common. Since the Double-Anti Movement, especially since the implementation of the Party's education policy, the situation has changed, but it still needs further research and resolution.

The phenomenon of emphasizing the ancient over the modern was very prominent in liberal arts in the past. In some majors, the curriculum setting of ancient times accounted for as much as four-fifths, while modern times only accounted for one-fifth. Science also had similar situations, such as the physics department, which spent a lot of time teaching the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory in quantum mechanics and the classical electronics theory in electrodynamics, but rarely taught or did not teach the latest achievements of modern physics. What was serious was not only the improper arrangement of the proportion of ancient and modern, but also the bourgeois teaching viewpoints of advocating the ancient and belittling the modern or praising the ancient and criticizing the modern. Some people thought that "only ancient things are considered learning, and modern things are not considered learning"; when teaching courses, they always preferred the more ancient the better, had a lot of feelings for ancient things, and were not interested in modern things. It would of course be difficult to talk about using the ancient for the present, and "the separation of theory from practice" also became an inevitable phenomenon.

After criticizing the bias of emphasizing the ancient over the modern, some people have another incorrect view of the relationship between ancient and modern, thinking that ancient things are all undesirable and should be removed from the university curriculum. This is naturally incorrect. Human cultural heritage, and China's ancient cultural heritage, must always be critically inherited. Therefore, in our newly drafted teaching plan, the ratio of ancient to modern has changed, but not too much. For example, in the Chinese department's history of literature, the ancient-modern ratio was 1:0.2 in the past, and now it is 1:0.37; in the history department, the ratio of ancient history to modern and contemporary history was 1:14 in the past, and now it is 1:16. This arrangement is appropriate. Emphasizing the modern and belittling the ancient does not mean that the ancient is not needed, but that the ancient and modern are reasonably arranged and treated with the correct viewpoint. With the change in the proportion of ancient and modern, new changes have also been made in the curriculum setting: the Chinese department has added Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, the use of reference books and philology, and logic; the history department has added selected readings of Marxist-Leninist classics and ancient Chinese writing practice; and the foreign language department has added contemporary revolutionary anthology of the working class, modern Chinese and writing practice. The strengthening of these theory and tool courses has a significant effect on professional teaching and connecting with current practice. Of course, the key to truly teaching and learning these courses well is to continuously improve the Marxist-Leninist ideological level of teachers and students.

Regarding the issue of indigenous and foreign methods, comprehensive universities do not come into contact with it as extensively as engineering schools, but in productive labor, they have also broken many superstitions and achieved many successes. In the past, students' experiments and production internships could only apply foreign equipment and foreign methods, and even production internships were consumption-oriented internships. Since engaging in work-study programs, they have gradually learned to use indigenous equipment and indigenous methods to solve problems, and to transform consumption-oriented internships into production-oriented internships, which has not only completed teaching and production tasks, but also learned the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods and walking on two legs, which can’t be said to be a great leap forward in teaching. There are many achievements and examples in this regard. For example, students majoring in astronomy manually made the first Maksutov telescope in China; students majoring in physics successfully trial-produced ferrite single crystals using indigenous equipment; students from various departments of geoscience used indigenous methods or a combination of indigenous and foreign methods in field work to solve many production problems, etc., all of which illustrate that the method of integrating theory with practice and walking on two legs is correct. Below, I will cite the fourth-order geological and geomorphological survey conducted by teachers and students of the Geography Department in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as the research on the Jingjiang meander that resulted from it, as an example:

After the summer last year, the geomorphology teaching and research group of the Geography Department went to the Jingjiang area to conduct investigations and research, but at first, they did not clearly realize the importance of relying on the masses, and the survey work did not make much progress. After summarizing and studying, they created a method of "combining indigenous and foreign methods." The so-called "indigenous method" is to rely on the masses, rely on the working people who have been fighting against the Jingjiang water disasters for thousands of years, visit them in depth, and take them as teachers; the so-called "foreign method" is to carry out aerial photo interpretation, micro-landform research, drilling, and so on to carry out work. At the beginning of the work, they interpreted aerial photos, found the remains of ancient river channels and the corresponding micro-landforms, and based on this exploration, visited the masses in depth. Then, based on the interview materials, they arranged manual drills, and further verified the interview materials through drilling. In one month, they interviewed more than 2,000 people, drilled more than 140 holes, collected a large amount of information, and found out the ancient river channel of the Jingjiang River. They put forward new opinions on the development history of the Jingjiang meander. Based on new and conclusive data, they overturned the conclusions made by predecessors, and put forward new and creative arguments on the cause of the meander. This fact fully demonstrates that the Party's leadership, the mass line, and the use of indigenous and foreign methods are the guarantee for doing a good job in production, scientific research, and comprehensively improving the quality of teaching.

Specialized Teaching and Scientific Research Must Combine Current Needs with the Long-Term Interests of the Country

The relationship between current interests and long-term interests is currently specifically reflected in the basic course teaching, specialized training, and scientific research topic selection, and the results directly affect the quality of our talent training. If handled well, the quality of education will be greatly improved; if handled poorly, it will also affect the development of education quality and scientific research. The issue of basic theoretical courses has been discussed earlier, and the following only discusses the issue of specialization and scientific research topic selection.

Since the all-round Great Leap Forward, specialized teaching has made great progress. Many majors have implemented the policy of combining teaching, production, and scientific research. On the basis of students having certain professional knowledge, they engage in production combined with their major and thus carry out scientific research. Some newly opened specializations have adopted the method of "learning what you do," learned some new knowledge, and used the latest scientific achievements to carry out professional production and new product trial production, which has played a great role in breaking superstition and cultivating students' ability to work independently. But the problem cannot stop here, and it must continue to be rectified, consolidated, and improved on the basis of the achievements already made. The knowledge range of talents cultivated in comprehensive universities cannot be too narrow, and the systematic specialized theoretical knowledge cannot be split, otherwise it will affect students' original creativity when working independently. Therefore, in the future, on the one hand, we should take care of the basic construction of specialization, such as organizing students to participate in the establishment of laboratories, carry out new product trial production and special research, etc. On the other hand, we should especially emphasize the training of specialized systematic knowledge, so that we can both combine with the current production and life situation and take into account the long-term interests of cultivating talents.

In scientific research, the situation is somewhat similar to that of specialized training. Practice has proved that scientific research can also adopt the mass line method. When the masses are enthusiastic and the direction is correct, several months of scientific research work can exceed the achievements of the past few years in terms of quality and quantity. Failing to make sufficient estimates of these achievements will lose confidence in progress and return to the old circle of "science for science." However, from the perspective of a university, teaching is the most important after all, and classes cannot always be suspended to engage in scientific research; at the same time, in the selection of scientific research topics, we cannot only see the things in front of us and only solve the problems that need to be solved in current production and life, but should be more comprehensive and combine current needs with the long-term interests of the country. Incorrectly solving this problem will not only lose long-term interests, but it is also difficult to do it well in the current arrangement. For example, regarding the issue of the construction of the three-combination base for teaching, production, and scientific research, the liberal arts departments do feel that the close combination of production and scientific research is difficult, and although the science departments are better, the difficulties are not non-existent. Students in the chemistry department can open an optical glass factory in conjunction with their major, but when a new product is successfully trial-produced, there is new progress in terms of scientific research, but the finished products that must be produced according to the plan must still be produced as usual, and the contradiction still exists. Therefore, it is very insufficient to keep all scientific research work at the level of current interests, and we must also prepare to solve the problems that will occur in production and life or may occur in the future. For the many contradictions that exist in scientific research, such as the contradiction between teaching and scientific research, the contradiction between factual needs and insufficient materials, and the contradiction between current needs and future needs, we must carefully line up and arrange them appropriately. On the one hand, we cannot be for science and science, divorced from politics, divorced from production practice, on the other hand, we cannot only care about current practicality and ignore the research of basic theory. Walking on two legs is still the basic principle.

The purpose of doing a good job in arranging basic course teaching, specialized training, and scientific research topic selection is to teach students well, so that they can become all-round developed, both red and expert, and communist construction talents who are useful today and even more useful tomorrow. When making arrangements, we must take into account the students' ability to bear it and their physical health, care about students' lives, reduce the excessive learning burden, strive for a rhythmic work and rest, and regularize physical exercise. These are all important parts of the integration of theory with practice and must be included in the entire arrangement.

    教学工作必须坚持理论联系实际的原则
    南京大学校长　郭影秋
    教育与生产劳动相结合，理论与实际相联系是中国教育的一大革命
    理论与实际相联系，是学习的主要方法，也是我们教学工作中必须坚持的原则。中央关于教育工作的指示中指出：“教授课程，必须贯彻执行理论与实际相联系的原则”，是完全正确的。几千年来，都是教育脱离劳动，脱离实际，今天要教育与生产劳动相结合，理论与实际相联系，确实是中国教育的一大革命。去年秋季以来，我们在开展这一革命的斗争中，在一些根本性的问题上如党的领导问题，教学工作中的群众路线问题，教育与生产劳动相结合的问题，改变社会风气的问题等方面，都取得重大成绩，但也还存在不少问题，彻底解决这些问题，还有待于继续不断的努力。
    旧的大学教育，主要是传授和学习间接经验，对于直接经验根本不加重视。学生一进入学校，即和生产实践、社会生活实践完全隔绝，即使做点教育实习或生产实习，也是浅尝即止，根本不能解决理论与实际相结合的原则问题。学生们所学到的尽是书本知识，这些书本知识有些是正确的，也有些是不正确的，即使他们的知识都是真理，但“也是他们的前人总结生产斗争和阶级斗争的经验写成的理论，不是他们自己亲身得来的知识”。（毛泽东）这种知识，只能是片面性的知识。怎样把这些知识运用到生活和实际中去，那就很成问题了。
    贯彻执行党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针以后，大学的教学工作，日益发生着深刻的变化。多数师生们，不再跟社会生活相隔绝，而是密切注意社会生活的发展；不再轻视生产劳动，而是把生产劳动列入教育计划。通过参加工农业生产劳动，野外工作劳动和社会义务劳动，不但加强了思想锻炼，创造了物质财富，而且在一定程度上巩固、提高了专业知识。至此，大学中所传授的不再是纯粹的间接经验，学生们所学习的也不光是书本知识，劳动改变了教学工作的面貌，劳动开始使师生们具有学以致用的能力。我们认为这是培养“有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者”的正确道路。
    基础课、专业课，都要贯彻理论与实际相联系的原则
    经过大半年的摸索，在基础理论课方面，有三个问题开始明确，即学时比重问题，与生产劳动结合问题，课程内容与教学方法问题。
    基础课与专业课的界限，有些专业较易划分，有些专业很难划分。旧教学计划中规定基础课和专业课在总学时中的比重为40％至60％，是很需要的；但是政治课的比重只占10％左右，那就不适当了。学习党的教育方针以后，政治课的比重上升为15％至20％，这就连带引起一个问题，在总学时大体不变的情况下，削减基础理论课呢还是适当调整专门化课和选修课？经过争论和试验以后，把各类课程比重规定为：政治课占总学时的15％至20％，基础课和专业课占50％至65％，专门化课和选修课占10％至25％（原为16％至34％），既加强了政治课，又适当增加了基础课和专业课的比重，对专门化课及选修课也按不同专
  业作了必要调整，我们认为这样安排是比较合适的。
    基础理论课能否结合生产，结合实际，是有争论的。有人强调基础理论的系统性，逻辑性，肯定不能结合生产、结合实际；有人则认为理论来自实践，生产劳动完全可以代替实验。这两种说法都有片面性。我们认为，理论是前人的或外域的直接经验，它的系统性应该受到尊重，可是“真正的理论在世界上只有一种，就是从客观实际抽出来又在客观实际中得到了证明的理论”（毛泽东）。如果把理论神秘化、概念化，不让它在客观实际中得到证明，那末这种“理论”就成为没有生命力的僵尸，现在无用将来也不会再有什么发展。相反，如果把理论应用于实际，不只可以推动生产与生活的发展，而且会在实践中更加巩固与发展理论知识。物理系的学生结合专业从事铁淦氧的生产，数学天文系的学生运用数学天文理论从事天文望远镜的制造，他们在这方面都有深刻体会。但这决不是说科学的理论系统可以任意割裂了，只要“做什么学什么”就行，而无须从事系统的理论学习了。某单位对基础理论课教学曾经进行过两种试验：一种是只讲授理论不进行实验，用生产劳动来代替实验；一种是只讲授工艺过程不讲理论，经过生产劳动以后再来补授理论。两种试验收效都不太好，实际是另一种形式的理论与实际脱节。结论是：基础理论课仍须系统进行，实验课也必须认真做好，生产劳动能代替一部分实验但不能完全代替实验。
    在基础理论教学中要体现理论与实际相联系的原则，对于课程内容与教学方法也必须作相应的改变。过去，基础课与专业课，多科并进，互不联属，教公共基础课的教师，只管本门学科的理论体系，不懂或者是不管专业课的理论体系，从教者来说，他所传授的东西诚然是系统的、完整的，但从学者来说，因为头绪纷繁，各自成理，在接受和消化各种不同的系统理论上，就要花上双倍的气力。因此，不只在课程安排上应该注意并进课程的相互联系，而在互有关联的各门学科的内容上也应相互照顾，去掉不必要的重复，增加相互阐明的资料；删减过分陈旧的内容，讲授最新的科学成就。这样，会在同样的教学时数中获得更好的教学效果。为了解决这个问题，我们开始试行两种办法：一种是由专业课的教师兼教基础课，如生物系的教师兼教本专业的数学；另一种是组织公共基础课的教师补学一定的专业课，如数学教师补学所教专业的物理学或地质学。前一种办法似乎有效一些，后一种办法则更切合今天教师缺乏的实际情况。
    合理安排“古”、“今”课程的比重，学会用土洋结合的办法进行实验和生产实习
    过去，教学与科学研究中，厚古薄今，重外轻中，只洋不土的现象是普遍的。双反运动以来特别是执行党的教育方针以来，情况有了改变，但还需要更进一步研究解决。
    厚古薄今的现象，在文科过去是很突出的，有些专业的课程设置，古代的多达五分之四，现代的只及五分之一。理科也有类似情况，如物理系，花费大量时间讲授量子力学中的波尔——索麦菲理论和电动力学中的经典电子学理论，但是很少讲或不讲近代物理学的最新成就。严重的还不仅在于古、今比重的安排不当，而在于泥古轻今或颂古非今的资产阶级教学观点。有人以为“只有古代的东西才算学问，近代的东西不算学问”；在讲授课程的时候总是越古越好，对古代的东西很有感情，对现代的东西则不感兴趣，这样培养出来的学生，当然很难谈到古为今用，“理论与实际相分离”也成为一种必然现象。
    批判了厚古薄今的偏向以后，有人对于古与今的关系又有另外一种不正确的看法，认为古代的东西都是要不得的，都要从大学的课程表中剔除出去。这自然是不对的，人类文化遗产，中国古代的文化遗产总是要批判地继承的。因之，在我们新拟的教学计划中，古与今的比例有了变动，但不是过大的变动。如：中文系的文学史，过去古今比例为1∶0.2，现在为1∶0.37；历史系的古代史和近代、现代史的比例，过去为1∶14，现在为1∶16。这种安排是合适的，厚今薄古并不是不要古了，而是把古、今合理的安排，用正确的观点去对待。随着古、今比重的变动，在课程设置上也作了新的变动：中文系增设了毛泽东文艺思想、工具书使用法及文献学、逻辑学，历史系增设了马列主义经典著作选读、古汉语写作实习，外文系增设了当代工人阶级革命文选、现代汉语和写作实习。这些理论和工具课的加强，对于专业教学与联系当前实际，均有重大作用。当然，要真正教好、学好这些课程，关键性的问题还在不断提高教者与学者的马列主义思想水平。
    关于土与洋的问题，在综合性的大学中，不如工科学校接触得那末广泛，但是在生产劳动中也破除了很多迷信，取得不少成绩。过去，学生的实验与生产实习，只会应用洋设备、洋办法，就连生产实习，也是消费性的实习。勤工俭学以来，已逐步学会用土设备、土办法解决问题，变消费性的实习为生产性的实习，既完成了教学、生产任务，又学会了土洋结合、两条腿走路的方法，不能不说是教学工作中的一大跃进。关于这方面的成就和事例很多，如天文专业的学生，用手工制成了国内第一架马克苏托夫式天文望远镜；物理专业的学生，用土设备试制成功铁淦氧单晶；地学各系的学生，在野外工作中运用土办法或土洋结合办法，解决许多生产问题等等，都说明理论与实际相联系，两条腿走路的方法是正确的。下面我且举地理系师生在长江中上游所作的第四纪地质及地貌调查，以及由此而进行的荆江河曲的研究工作，作为例子：
    地理系地貌教研组，去年暑后到荆江地区做调查研究工作，开始没有明确依靠群众的重要性，查勘工作进展不大。经过总结研究，他们创造了“土洋结合”的办法。所谓“土办法”，就是依靠群众，依靠千百年来长期与荆江水患作斗争的劳动人民，深入访问他们，拜他们为师；所谓“洋办法”，就是进行航摄照片判读，微地貌的研究以及打钻等等来开展工作。工作开始，他们判读了航摄照片，找出古河道的遗迹与相应的微地貌，根据这个探索，深入群众访问，再根据访问材料布置手摇钻，通过打钻进一步实证访问资料。一个月中，他们访问了二千多人次，打钻一百四十余孔，搜集大量资料，查明荆江古河道，对于荆江河曲的发展史提出了新的意见，依据新的确凿的资料，推翻了前人所作的结论，并对河曲成因问题提出新的富有创造性的论据。这一事实，充分说明了：党的领导，群众路线，运用土洋结合的方法，是做好生产、科学研究工作，全面提高教学质量的保证。
    专门化教学和科学研究要把当前需要和国家的长远利益结合起来
    当前利益与长远利益的关系，目前具体反映在基础课教学、专门化训练与科学研究选题这几个问题上，其结果均直接影响着我们培养人材的质量。处理得好，教育质量会大大提高，处理得不好，也会影响教育质量和科学研究事业的发展。基础理论课的问题，前面已经作了论述，下面只谈一下专门化及科学研究选题的问题。
    全面大跃进以来，专门化教学有了很大的进展，许多专业都贯彻了教学、生产、科学研究三结合的方针，在学生具有一定专业知识的基础上，从事结合专业的生产并从而开展科学研究。有些新开的专门化，采取“做什么学什么”的办法，学得了一些新的知识，并利用科学最新成就，进行专业生产和新产品试制工作，对于破除迷信，培养学生独立工作的能力，起了很大作用。但是问题不能停在这里，必须在既得成绩的基础上，继续整顿、巩固、提高。综合大学中培养的人材，其知识范围不能太窄，系统的专门化理论知识不能割裂，否则将会影响学生独立工作时的独创能力。因此，今后应该一面照顾专门化的基本建设，如组织学生参加建立实验室，进行新产品试制和专题研究等等，另方面又要特别强调专门化系统知识的训练，这样，既可以结合当前生产、生活情况，又兼顾了培养人材的长远利益。
    在科学研究方面，和专门化训练的情况有些类似。实践证明，科学研究也能采用群众路线的方法，当群众干劲冲天，方向对头的时候，几个月的科学研究工作，在质与量上都超过过去几年的成绩。对这些成绩不作足够的估计，就会丧失前进信心，走回“为科学而科学”的老圈子。但是从一个大学来说，教学工作毕竟是主要的，不能老是停课搞科学研究；同时，在科学研究选题方面也不能只看到眼前的东西，只解决目前生产、生活中所要解决的问题，而应当更全面一些，把当前需要和国家长远利益结合起来。不正确地解决这个问题，不只长远利益将会受到损失，即在当前安排上也是很难做得通的。例如，关于教学、生产、科学研究三结合基地建设的问题，文科各系固然感到生产与科学研究的紧密结合有困难，理科各系虽然比较好些，但困难也不是不存在。化学系的学生可以结合自己的专业开办一个光学玻璃厂，但当一种新产品试制成功的时候，作为科学研究来说又有新的进展，但是按照计划进行的生产成品还必须照常生产，矛盾仍然存在。因此，把一切科学研究工作都停留在当前利益的做法是很不够的，还要准备解决生产、生活中将要发生或以后可能发生的问题。对于科学研究中存在的许多矛盾，如教学与科学研究的矛盾，事实需要与材料不足的矛盾，现在需要和将来需要的矛盾，必须仔细排队，恰当安排。一方面不能为科学而科学；脱离政治，脱离生产实际，另一方面又不能只顾目前实用而忽视基础理论的研究。两条腿走路，仍然是基本原则。
    做好基础课教学，专门化训练与科学研究选题的安排，其目的都是为了教好学生，使他们成为全面发展的，又红又专的，今天有用明天更有用的共产主义建设人材。在作安排的时候，必须照顾到学生的承受能力和身体健康情况，关心学生的生活，减除过重的学习负担，工作休息力求有节奏，体育锻炼做到经常化，这些都是理论与实际相联系的重要部分，必须纳入整个安排之中。
