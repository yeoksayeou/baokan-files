Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

I firmly support the government's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet. I strongly denounce the crimes of the former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique in betraying the motherland and undermining unity. I resolutely oppose the attempts of imperialism and foreign reactionaries to interfere in our internal affairs and undermine Sino-Indian friendship by taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion.

The four years of the First National People's Congress were four years of rapid progress in China's socialist transformation and socialist construction. Over the past four years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, China's health work has also been advancing at a rapid pace, along with the development of industrial and agricultural production. In particular, after the great rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, as well as the practical education of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the experience of going to the countryside and participating in grassroots work, the ideological awareness of the vast number of health workers has generally improved. The political and ideological outlook of the health departments has undergone fundamental changes. The long-standing tendency of neglecting politics and neglecting the leadership of the Party has been fundamentally reversed. The Party's mass line has been further implemented and developed in health work, thereby promoting a great leap forward in health work.

Health work serves production, scientific and technical personnel combine with the masses, and intensive work combines with regular work. The health movement has achieved great success.

The great leap forward in health work is prominently manifested in the great development of the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases. Thanks to the leadership of the Party, the implementation of the principle of health work serving production, the combination of scientific and technical personnel with the masses, and the combination of intensive work with regular work, the health movement has achieved great success. In recent years, under the united action of the entire people, a large number of flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows have been eliminated. In 1958 alone, more than 1.9 billion rats and 2.1 billion sparrows were exterminated, greatly reducing the harm caused by the four pests. Many advanced areas and units that were basically "free of the four pests" emerged, and much experience was accumulated, laying a preliminary foundation for the complete elimination of the four pests in the future. While eliminating the four pests, various localities, in conjunction with production, improved environmental hygiene. Many places rebuilt toilets, cleared accumulated garbage, turned potholes into flat ground, and dredged ditches to ensure smooth flow, ensuring that livestock had pens and poultry had nests. This not only eliminated breeding grounds for the four pests but also created a beautiful and comfortable living environment. Emphasizing hygiene and loving cleanliness are becoming a social norm.

With the development of the work of eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene and the active prevention and treatment of diseases, smallpox, plague, and kala-azar have been basically eliminated. Cholera has not occurred since liberation. The incidence of several common acute infectious diseases such as typhus and relapsing fever has also decreased. Schistosomiasis, which was prevalent in twelve provinces and cities, has been basically eliminated in some areas. The epidemic areas that were once described as "villages desolate with people's excrement and houses empty with ghosts singing" have shown a new atmosphere of prosperity and longevity. Malaria, which was once widespread and had a high incidence rate in our country, has been basically eliminated in many counties and cities, and the incidence rate in other areas has also been greatly reduced. For example, Simao County in Yunnan and Lingling County in Hunan were once well-known high-malaria areas. Before liberation, the incidence rate of malaria was as high as 70% to 90%. After several years of active prevention and treatment, the incidence rate has been reduced to 0.37% and 0.16% respectively. Diseases such as filariasis, hookworm disease, venereal diseases, and goiter, which have seriously harmed the people, have also been basically eliminated in some areas. For Kaschin–Beck disease, which was once considered untreatable, there are now relatively effective treatment methods. Due to the widespread establishment of rural maternity hospitals and the implementation of new midwifery methods, the incidence of tetanus neonatorum and puerperal fever has been greatly reduced. The phenomenon of acute poisoning and heatstroke has been basically controlled in factories and mines, and relatively effective prevention and treatment methods have also been developed for silicosis and chronic poisoning.

With the development of the movement to eliminate the four pests, emphasize hygiene, and eliminate major diseases, other tasks of the health departments have also greatly developed. By 1957, every county had a hospital. The number of hospital beds nationwide had increased to 440,000 in 1958. At the same time, to meet the needs of the people, a large number of simple hospital beds were also established. With the development of people's communes, most people's communes have hospitals and maternity hospitals, production brigades have health clinics and health stations, and production teams have barefoot doctors. Many hospitals have implemented a three-shift outpatient system, and many unreasonable old rules and regulations are being reformed. Preventive work centered on hospitals has also begun, and many medical personnel have gone deep into factories, mines, rural areas, and neighborhoods, delivering medicine to fields and construction sites. Their medical style and service attitude have improved significantly. The production of medicines and equipment has greatly developed in recent years thanks to the efforts of relevant departments.

Implement the Party's policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine,
Chinese and Western medicine unite and cooperate, using both indigenous and foreign methods,
Many inventions, creations, and advanced examples have emerged

In recent years, we have vigorously reversed the thinking of underestimating and discriminating against Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The Party's policy on TCM has been further implemented, and the unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine have gradually strengthened. The vast number of TCM practitioners have been given appropriate job arrangements. Most provinces and cities have established TCM colleges and organized TCM practitioners to take apprentices. Western doctors are learning TCM, and the number of Western doctors who have left their jobs to study TCM has reached more than 2,000, with even more people studying TCM while on the job. Research on TCM and the collection of verified and secret prescriptions of TCM have been widely carried out. The unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine are playing an increasingly important role in the work of preventing and treating diseases.

Due to breaking superstitions, liberating thinking, and launching a technical revolution movement, the vast number of health workers have developed a style of daring to think, speak, and act. Under the principle of combining TCM and Western medicine and using both indigenous and foreign methods, many inventions, creations, and advanced examples have emerged. Weak links in medical science in the past have begun to be strengthened, such as cardiac surgery and neurology have greatly developed. The promotion of short-term therapy in the treatment of schistosomiasis has greatly improved the medical effect. Under the close cooperation of TCM and Western medicine, better curative effects have also been achieved in the treatment of diseases such as cirrhosis, chronic nephritis, and hypertension.

Great achievements have also been made in the work of training cadres. During the first five-year plan period, more than 25,000 graduates from higher medical colleges and more than 96,000 graduates from secondary health schools have been added to the health front. According to the Party's policy of education serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor, and in view of the problems existing in medical education in the past, we have also proposed that medical education should be combined with the mass health movement of eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating diseases. The face of medical education in our country is also undergoing changes.

In health work, we should continue to implement the mass line, combine experts with the masses, and rapidly and effectively improve the health appearance of the Chinese people.

Although great achievements have been made in health work in recent years, we must not be complacent in the slightest. There are still some shortcomings in our work that need to be improved with efforts. Many new problems have emerged in the Great Leap Forward, which need to be solved by us. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the new situation of people's communization, the task of health work is even more arduous. Premier Zhou clearly instructed us in the government work report that "in health work, we should continue to implement the mass line, combine experts with the masses, and rapidly and effectively improve the health appearance of the Chinese people. We should unite TCM and Western medicine, organize them to jointly serve the people's health cause, and jointly promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and develop medical science." This is the guideline that must be followed in health work in the future.

In order to earnestly implement the above guidelines, I would like to focus on the following two issues.

I. On Continuing to Carry Out the Patriotic Health Movement and Doing a Good Job in the Collective Hygiene Work

The patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases has achieved great success in recent years. However, to completely accomplish the task of eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases is still a very arduous task that requires persistent efforts. The basic requirements of the patriotic health movement in 1959 are: to basically eliminate the four pests in all possible places (and to vigorously eliminate snails in areas with schistosomiasis), to eliminate the four major parasitic diseases (schistosomiasis, malaria, filariasis, and hookworm disease), to actively prevent and treat and eliminate other diseases that seriously harm the people, and to vigorously and promptly prevent the spread of seasonal infectious diseases. Further carry out labor protection in industrial and agricultural production and prevent and control occupational diseases that endanger health, and strive to avoid and reduce industrial accidents.

The production tasks in 1959 are still heavy. The work of eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases must be closely combined with production and serve production. Under the leadership of the Party, continue to carry out mass movements, implement the combination of scientific and technical personnel and the masses, the unity and cooperation of TCM and Western medicine, the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and comprehensive measures. According to the characteristics of the rapid breeding of the four pests and the complexity of disease transmission factors, seize the opportunity to carry out several intensive campaigns a year. Festivals such as the Spring Festival, May Day, National Day, and New Year's Day are all good opportunities, and hygiene blitzes should be carried out in conjunction with welcoming these festivals. And on the basis of intensive campaigns, adhere to regular work. Without intensive campaigns, the four pests cannot be dealt a decisive blow. With only intensive campaigns and no regular work, the existing achievements cannot be consolidated. In particular, it is necessary to prevent the idea of ​​paralysis and relaxation due to certain achievements. We must continue to boost our energy, increase our enthusiasm, make persistent efforts, and advance victoriously.

With the realization of people's communes, great changes have taken place in the labor and life of the vast number of peasants in our country. Hygiene work must adapt to this new change, better implement the policy of prevention first, and focus on eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating major diseases. Under the leadership of the Party committee, combine with production and make unified arrangements. First of all, it is necessary to strengthen hygiene work in collective production labor. In the fields, construction sites, factories and mines, vigorously carry out publicity and education on various hygiene knowledge such as disease prevention, injury prevention, heat prevention, cold prevention, dust prevention, poisoning prevention, and moisture prevention, and take practical and feasible measures to carry out these protective work. Tense labor must be adjusted with appropriate rest. We must carefully arrange work and rest in order to carry out production rhythmically and maintain higher efficiency. Women, the elderly, the weak, and underage laborers should be given appropriate care according to their physiological characteristics. We must strive to do a good job in hygiene work in collective life. Public canteens should plan to prepare and supply grains and vegetables to ensure that commune members eat enough, eat well, eat clean and hygienic, and pay attention to nutrition appropriately. Kindergartens, nurseries, and schools are places to care for and cultivate the new generation, and children generally have lower resistance. It is especially necessary to strengthen the hygiene work in these places and vigorously prevent the occurrence of various infectious diseases. Once diseases occur, they should be isolated and treated in time. With the construction of the commune, some places have begun or plan to build new collective houses. When planning and constructing, we must fully consider the treatment of feces, garbage, and sewage, as well as the problems of water sources, ventilation, and sunlight, so that the new houses are more suitable for hygiene requirements. Personal hygiene must also be paid attention to. We must develop good hygiene habits such as not spitting everywhere, bathing frequently, and washing and changing clothes and bedding frequently, thoroughly changing the backward and unhygienic appearance left over from the old society, and establishing a new social atmosphere of emphasizing hygiene and loving cleanliness.

Eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and eliminating diseases are fundamental and important measures to enhance people's physique, protect labor, and improve labor efficiency. We hope that the broad masses of people will continue to actively participate in the patriotic health movement, so that we can build socialism with strong bodies and full spirits. We ask the deputies of the National People's Congress and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to give strong support, regularly supervise and inspect, and promote the advancement of this movement.

II. On Further Strengthening the Unity and Cooperation between Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine to Better Eliminate Diseases and Develop China's Medical Science

The Party often teaches us that we must unite traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine well. This is not only because China has a large population and a vast territory, and the task of health work is very arduous, and can only be completed by giving full play to the strength of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, but also because it is extremely important to the development of China's medical science. Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine both have certain strengths and can cure many diseases; however, both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine also have their limitations, and there are still shortcomings in the prevention and treatment of diseases. And the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine will make some diseases that neither traditional Chinese medicine nor Western medicine can treat have new treatment methods; in addition, some diseases can be treated by both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, but the effect is not satisfactory, and better treatment methods have been developed through the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. Many vivid examples have emerged in the medical work practice of combining traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in various places. This not only greatly improves the curative effect and is beneficial to patients, but also enriches China's medical science and is conducive to the gradual development of China's original school of medicine. Facts have proved that the task of inheriting and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and developing China's medical science must be carried out by traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine learning from each other, helping each other, learning from each other's strengths and supplementing each other's weaknesses, and uniting and cooperating. We must carefully sort out and study the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine with modern scientific methods. The most important thing at present is to run the Western doctors' off-the-job training courses of traditional Chinese medicine, so as to train a new force that can systematically sort out and study the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine as soon as possible. At the same time, we must also strive to learn and master the advanced achievements of modern medicine. We must continue to overcome the tendency of national nihilism that discriminates against and excludes traditional Chinese medicine, and at the same time prevent the tendency to ignore modern medicine. In the face of science, we must be realistic and seek truth from facts. We must not have any exaggeration or stick to conventions. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, on the basis of unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, China's medical science will surely achieve rapid development.

Our conference is a conference of unity and a conference of leap forward. All the staff on our medical and health front, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, and under the glorious illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, will continue to leap forward with the leap forward of industrial and agricultural production.

专栏：

    讲卫生除疾病创造美好生活环境
    卫生部李德全部长的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    我坚决拥护政府对西藏叛乱的平定。严厉声讨原西藏地方政府及上层反动集团背叛祖国破坏统一的罪行。并坚决反对帝国主义和外国反动派利用西藏叛乱干涉我国内政，破坏中印友谊的企图。
    第一届人代大会期间的四年，是我国社会主义改造、社会主义建设，突飞猛进的四年。四年来，我国的卫生工作，在党和政府的领导下，随着工农业生产的发展，也在以快速的步伐前进。特别是经过伟大的整风运动和反右派斗争，以及工农业生产大跃进的现实教育和上山下乡参加基层工作的锻炼，广大卫生人员思想觉悟普遍有了提高，卫生部门的政治思想面貌起了根本的变化，长期存在的忽视政治、忽视党的领导的倾向，得到了基本的扭转，党的群众路线在卫生工作中有了进一步的贯彻和发展，从而促进了卫生工作的大跃进。
    卫生工作为生产服务，科学技术人员与群众结合，突击工作与经常工作结合，卫生运动取得了巨大成就
    卫生工作的大跃进，突出地表现在以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动，有了很大的发展。由于在党的领导下，贯彻执行了卫生工作为生产服务，科学技术人员与群众相结合，突击工作与经常工作相结合的原则，卫生运动取得了巨大的成绩。几年来，在全民动手的一致行动下，消灭了大量的苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、麻雀，仅一九五八年就灭鼠十九亿余只，灭雀二十一亿余只，从而使四害的危害程度大大减轻，出现了不少基本“四无”的先进地区和先进单位，并积累了许多经验，为今后彻底消灭四害，打下初步的基础，在除四害的同时，各地结合生产，改善了环境卫生。很多地方改建了厕所，清除了多年积存的垃圾，把坑洼变为平地，使沟渠疏通畅流，做到牲畜有圈，家禽有窝。既消灭了四害孳生条件，又创造了美好舒适的生活环境。讲卫生，爱清洁，正在形成为一种社会风气。
    随着除四害、讲卫生工作的开展和对疾病的积极防治，天花、鼠疫、黑热病已基本消灭。解放后一直未发生过霍乱。几种常见的急性传染病如斑疹伤寒、回归热等的发病率也降低了。流行十二省市的血吸虫病，已在部分地区基本消灭。过去“千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌”的疫区，出现了人寿年丰欣欣向荣的新气象。过去在我国流行很广、发病率很高的疟疾，已在许多县、市基本消灭，其他地区发病率也大为降低。如云南思茅县、湖南零陵县都是过去有名的高疟区，解放前，疟疾的发病率高达百分之七十至九十以上，经过几年来的积极防治，发病率已分别降低到零点三七，零点一六。一向危害人民严重的丝虫病、钩虫病，性病、甲状腺肿等疾病，也在一些地区基本消灭。对于过去被认为无法治疗的大骨节病，目前已经有了比较有效的治疗方法。由于农村产院的普遍建立，推行了新法接生，婴儿破伤风和产妇褥热的发病率已大为降低。在工矿中基本控制了急性中毒、高温中暑现象，对矽肺及慢性中毒也有了比较有效的防治办法。
    随着除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病的运动的开展，卫生部门的其他各项工作也有了很大的发展。一九五七年已达到县县有医院。全国病床一九五八年已发展到四十四万张，同时为了满足人民的需要，还举办了大量的简易病床。随着人民公社的发展，大多数人民公社都有了医院、产院，生产大队都有了卫生所、保健站，生产小队都有了不脱产的卫生员。很多医院实行了三班门诊制，许多不合理的陈规陋矩正在进行改革。以医院为中心的预防工作也已经开展起来，许多医务人员深入工矿、农村、地段，把医药送到田间、工地。他们的医疗作风、服务态度有了比较显著的改进。药品器材的生产，在有关部门的努力下，几年来有很大发展。
        贯彻党的中医政策，
    中西医团结合作，土洋并
    举，出现了不少的发明创
    造和先进事例
    几年来我们大力扭转了轻视歧视中医的思想，党的中医政策，得到了进一步的贯彻，中西医团结合作日渐加强。广大中医已得到了工作上的适当安排。大多数省市都办了中医学院校并且组织了中医带徒弟。西医学习中医正在开展，西医离职学习中医的人数前后已达二千余人，在职学习中医的人更加广泛。中医研究工作和搜集中医验方秘方的工作已广泛开展起来，中西医团结合作，在防治疾病的工作中日益发挥着巨大的作用。
    由于破除迷信，解放思想，开展技术革命运动，广大卫生人员发扬了敢想敢说敢做的风格，在中西结合、土洋并举的原则下，出现了不少的发明创造和先进事例，过去医学科学的薄弱环节已开始加强，如心脏外科、脑科有了很大的发展。由于在治疗血吸虫病中推广了短期
  疗法，医疗效果大大提高。在中西医密切合作下，对治疗肝硬变、慢性肾炎、高血压等疾病也有了较好的疗效。
    培养干部的工作也取得了很大成绩，在第一个五年计划时期已有二万五千多名高等医学院校毕业生和九万六千多名中等卫生学校毕业生充实到卫生战线上去。根据党的教育为工人阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，针对过去医学教育中存在的问题，我们还提出了医学教育结合除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病的群众卫生运动，学习祖国医学，我国医学教育的面貌也正在发生变化。
    在卫生工作中应当继续贯彻执行群众路线，使专家和群众结合起来，迅速有效地改进我国人民的卫生面貌
    几年来卫生工作虽然取得了很大成绩，但是我们丝毫不能自满，我们工作中还存在着一些缺点，需要努力改进，大跃进中出现了许多新的问题，有待于我们去解决。随着工农业生产的大跃进和人民公社化的新形势，卫生工作的任务是更加繁重了。周总理在政府工作报告中，明确指示我们，“在卫生工作中，应当继续贯彻执行群众路线，使专家和群众结合起来，迅速有效地改进我国人民的卫生面貌。应当团结中西医，组织他们共同为人民卫生事业服务，共同发扬祖国医学遗产和发展医药科学。”这是今后卫生工作必须遵循的方针。
    为了认真贯彻执行上述方针，我想着重谈谈以下两个问题。
      一、关于继续开展爱国卫生运
  动，作好集体化的卫生工作
    以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动，几年来虽然取得了巨大成绩，但是要彻底完成除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病的任务，还是一个十分艰巨的工作，需要进行坚持不懈的努力。一九五九年爱国卫生运动的基本要求是：在一切可能的地方基本上消除四害（有血吸虫病的地方还要大力消灭钉螺），消灭四大寄生虫病（血吸虫病、疟疾、丝虫病、钩虫病），积极防治和消灭其他危害人民严重的疾病，并大力及早预防季节性传染病的流行。在工农业生产中进一步开展劳动保护和防治危害健康的职业病的工作，力求避免和减少工伤事故。
    一九五九年的生产任务仍然繁重，除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病的工作，必须紧密结合生产，为生产服务，在党的领导下，继续开展群众运动，实行科学技术人员与群众相结合，中西医团结合作，土洋并举，综合措施，根据四害繁殖快、疾病传播因素复杂的特点，抓紧时机一年搞几次突击运动，如春节、五一节、国庆节、新年等都是很好的时机，应该配合迎接这些节日开展卫生突击运动。并在突击运动的基础上坚持经常的工作。没有突击运动，就不能给四害以决定性的打击，只有突击运动，没有经常工作，就不能巩固已有的成果，特别要防止因为取得一定成绩而产生麻痹松劲的思想。必须继续鼓足干劲，提高热忱，再接再厉，乘胜前进。
    随着人民公社化的实现，我国广大农民的劳动和生活都发生了很大的变化，卫生工作必须适应这种新的变化，更好地贯彻预防为主的方针，以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心，在党委领导下，结合生产，统一安排。首先要加强集体生产劳动中的卫生工作，在田间、工地、厂矿中”要大力开展防病、防伤、防暑、防寒、防尘、防毒、防潮等各项卫生知识的宣传教育，并采取切实可行的办法来进行这些防护工作。紧张的劳动，必须要有适当的休息来调节，要认真作好劳逸安排，以便有节奏地、保持更高效率进行生产。对妇女、老弱及未成年的劳动力，要根据其生理特点予以适当的照顾。要努力作好集体生活中的卫生工作，公共食堂要有计划地准备和供应粮食，菜蔬，要保证社员吃得饱、吃得好、吃得干净卫生，并适当注意营养。幼儿园、托儿所和学校是托育和培养新生一代的地方，而小孩子一般抵抗力较低，要特别加强这些地方的卫生工作，大力预防各种传染病的发生，一旦发病要及时隔离和治疗。随着公社的建设，有的地方已开始或筹划建筑新的集体住宅。在进行规划和建筑时，要充分考虑到粪便、垃圾、污水的处理及水源、通风、阳光等问题，使新建住宅更加适合卫生的要求。个人卫生也必须注意，要养成不随地吐痰，勤洗澡、勤洗换衣被等卫生习惯，彻底改变旧社会遗留下来的落后不卫生的面貌，树立起讲卫生、爱清洁的新的社会风气。
    除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病，是增强人民体质，保护劳动力，提高劳动效率的一项带根本性的重要措施。我们希望广大人民继续积极地来参加爱国卫生运动，使我们能以身强力壮，精神饱满地建设社会主义。我们要求人大代表，政协委员大力支持，经常督促检查，推动这一运动前进。
      二、关于进一步加强中西医团结
  合作，更好地消灭疾病与发展我国医
  药科学
    党经常教导我们，必须很好地团结中西医。这不但因为中国人多、地大，卫生工作的任务十分繁重，只有充分发挥中西医的力量才能完成，同时对发展我国的医药科学也极为重要。中医、西医都有一定的特长，都能治好很多疾病；但是中医、西医也都有它的局限性，在防治疾病中都还有不足之处。而中、西医结合起来，就会使得某些中医、西医本来都没有办法治疗的疾病，有了新的治疗办法；另外有些疾病中医、西医都能治疗，但效果不够圆满，经过中、西医结合则有了更好的治疗办法。各地在中、西医结合的医疗工作实践中，已出现不少生动的事例。这不但大大提高了疗效，有利于病人，而且也丰富了我国医学科学，有利于逐步发展我国具有独创性的医药学派。事实证明，继承发扬祖国医学遗产，发展我国医药科学的任务，必须中、西医互相学习，互相帮助，取长
  补短，团结合作，才有可能。我们对祖国医学遗产，要用现代科学的方法认真加以整理研究，目前重要的是办好西医离职学习中医班，以期尽快地培养出一批对祖国医药学遗产进行
  有系统整理研究的新生力量。同时我们还必须努力学习和掌握现代医学的先进成就。我们要继续克服歧视、排斥中医的民族虚无主义的倾
  向，同时也要防止忽视现代医学的倾向。在科学面前我们必须实事求是，既不能有任何浮夸也不能故步自封。我们坚信，在党的领导下，在中、西医团结合作的基础上，我国医药科学一定可以获得很快的发展。
    我们这次的大会，是一个团结的大会，跃
  进的大会。我们医药卫生战线上的全体工作人
  员和全国人民一道，在党的领导下，在鼓足干
  劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，随着工农业生产的跃进，继续跃进。
