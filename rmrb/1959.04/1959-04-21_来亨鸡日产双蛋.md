    Leghorn Chicken Lays Double Eggs Daily
    In the Yinchuan City Afforestation Station's chicken farm, fifteen Leghorn chickens have laid double eggs twenty-two times in the past twenty-odd days, with one chicken laying double eggs three times. These Leghorn chickens were specially selected by the chicken farm and raised in enclosed housing. Electric lights are installed in the chicken coop. In addition to allowing the hens to move freely and feed during the day, they are also fed twice at night and the lights are turned on for several hours to allow the hens to be active as they are during the day. The feed is diversified, with a combination of refined and coarse grains. Hard grains are cooked soft or soaked to sprout before being fed.

    来亨鸡日产双蛋
    银川市造林站养鸡场，最近的二十多天中，有十五只来亨鸡共下了二十二次双蛋，最多的一只下过三次双蛋。这些来亨鸡是鸡场特别挑选出来用舍饲办法饲养的。鸡舍里安装有电灯，除了让母鸡白天自由活动吃食外，夜间也喂两次食并开灯照明几个小时，让母鸡和白天一样活动。在饲料上做到多样化，精粗配合，干硬的粮食就煮软或用水泡发芽后再喂。
