Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The Czechoslovakian newspaper "Free Word" published a commentary today entitled "Tibetan Reactionaries Miscalculated," stating that the swift crushing of the Tibetan rebellion will certainly accelerate the development of the Tibetan region. The conspiracy of the reactionaries to hinder the happiness and progress of the Tibetan people has been completely bankrupted.

The commentary pointed out that after the peaceful liberation of Tibet by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, it opened up a path to a new life for the Tibetan people. However, the Tibetan reactionaries were afraid of the broad prospects unfolding before the Tibetan people. They regarded the Central People's Government's attitude of leniency as a sign of weakness and, with the support of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and imperialism, launched a rebellion, thus committing the great crime of betraying the motherland.

The commentary pointed out that from the reactions of Taiwan and the Western bloc, it can be seen that the Tibetan rebellion was an imperialist conspiracy, but this conspiracy was resolutely opposed by all the Chinese people, including the Tibetan people.

The "Labor Daily" condemned the Western bloc's hysterical shouting about the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion in a commentary today. The commentary said that any upright democrat should rejoice that the actions of the Tibetan reactionaries have been crushed.

The Bulgarian "People's Army Daily" published a commentary on the 3rd, saying that the imperialist bloc armed and instigated the Tibetan reactionaries to launch a rebellion in order to realize the old plan of separating Tibet from China. International reactionary forces attempted to hinder the development of Tibet, placing it under the oppression of feudal lords and reactionaries in order to use it to realize their dirty plan of aggression against the socialist camp countries, especially the People's Republic of China. However, as in the past, the plans of the enemies of peace have once again failed.

    西藏反动分子打错了算盘
    捷、保报纸评论西藏叛国事件
    新华社5日讯　今天捷克斯洛伐克的“自由言论报”在一篇题为“西藏反动分子打错了算盘”的评论中说，西藏叛乱的被迅速粉碎一定会加速西藏地区的发展。反动分子企图阻碍西藏人民幸福和进步的阴谋是永远地破产了。
    评论指出，中华人民共和国中央人民政府和平解放西藏后，给西藏人民开辟了走向新生活的道路。然而西藏反动派却害怕在西藏人民面前展开的广阔远景，他们把中央人民政府宽大为怀的态度当作了软弱的表现，在蒋介石集团和帝国主义的支持下发动了叛乱，从而犯下了出卖祖国的极大罪行。
    评论指出，从台湾以及西方集团的反映中可以看出，西藏叛乱是帝国主义的阴谋，但是这一阴谋行动却遭到了包括西藏人民在内的全体中国人民的坚决反对。
      “劳动报”今天在一篇评论中谴责了西方集团对平定西藏叛乱所进行的歇斯底里的叫喊。评论说，任何一个正直的民主主义者都应当对西藏反动派的行为遭到粉碎而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    保加利亚“人民军报”在3日发表的评论中说，帝国主义集团武装并煽动西藏反动分子发动叛乱是为了实现使西藏脱离中国的老计划。国际反动势力企图阻挠西藏的发展，把它置于封建主和反动分子的压迫下，以便利用它来实现对社会主义阵营各国、特别是对中华人民共和国进行侵略的肮脏计划。但是，同以往一样，和平的敌人的计划这一次又落空了。
