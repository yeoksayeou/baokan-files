Increasing Wealth for Society, Increasing Income for the Masses
The Experience of the Commercial System in Heilongjiang Province in Expanding Waste Product Acquisition

Last year, the work of waste product acquisition in Heilongjiang Province saw a new leap forward. The total value of waste products acquired throughout the year reached over 100 million yuan. The amount of scrap iron and miscellaneous copper acquired was more than double that of 1957.

How was such a great achievement obtained?

Relying on the Leadership of the Party Committee
Combining with Central Work

Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the waste product acquisition departments in this province, according to the principles of "support, concede, squeeze," closely combined with the central work of the Party at various times, and vigorously acquired waste products. For example, after the Great Leap Forward in industry, the acquisition of industrial raw materials, mainly scrap iron and miscellaneous copper, was expanded, supporting the leap forward in industry. During the "Industrial Drought Resistance" campaign, the Secretary of the Mudanjiang Municipal Party Committee personally took command, launching a waste product recycling campaign throughout the city, increasing the acquisition of miscellaneous copper and scrap iron, and promoting waste product acquisition work.

Unfolding Propaganda, Mobilizing the Masses

In order to make the significance of acquiring waste products known to every household and mobilize the masses to actively sell waste products, acquisition departments throughout the province used more than 20 popular and easy-to-understand forms, such as physical object exhibitions, slides, clapper talks, radio broadcasts, and blackboards, to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda among the masses. Through propaganda, the broad masses further understood the benefits of collecting and selling waste products for supporting national construction and increasing personal income, which powerfully promoted the smooth development of waste product acquisition work throughout the province.

Combining Surprise Campaigns with Regular Acquisition

Under the circumstances of an all-round leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, in order to facilitate the masses in selling waste products, the acquisition departments adopted the methods of "exploiting gaps, squeezing time" and combining with central work to carry out surprise acquisitions, which achieved great results. The Provincial People's Committee and the Department of Commerce issued six instructions to launch surprise waste product acquisition campaigns, one after another, expanding the quantity of waste products acquired and supporting central work. For example, during the surprise acquisition campaign in August last year, the province collected a total of 726 tons of miscellaneous copper, equivalent to the total amount acquired from January to July.

Acquisition departments frequently take goods to the countryside, acquiring waste products on the one hand and supplying daily necessities on the other; the masses use waste products to sell for money and exchange for goods, greatly facilitating the masses and benefiting the development of acquisition work.

Accumulate, Pick, Dig

According to the characteristic of waste products being scattered, acquisition departments in various places, on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, adopted the methods of "accumulate," "pick," and "dig."

"Accumulate" means mobilizing the masses to accumulate waste products. The specific method is to use old wooden boxes or old bamboo baskets, write "Treasure Bowl" on them, place them in fixed locations, and mobilize the masses to put the waste products collected daily into them at any time, and sell them to the waste product acquisition department at a certain time. By the end of last year, more than one million households in the province had established "Treasure Bowls," and the province acquired waste products worth more than 5.36 million yuan through the form of "Treasure Bowls."

"Pick" means mobilizing the masses to pay attention to picking up waste products at any time. In Harbin City last year, the masses picked up more than 500,000 jin of waste paper alone, worth more than 20,000 yuan.

"Dig" means excavating underground and all potential resources. Last year, the total value of various waste products excavated throughout the province reached 3.39 million yuan, including more than 600 tons of miscellaneous copper and more than 47,000 tons of scrap iron.

Beautify the Home

"Acquiring waste products, beautifying the home" is an acquisition method first created in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province. The Heilongjiang commercial system has universally promoted and developed this experience throughout the province. The specific method is: under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, relevant departments are assigned to cooperate to form a "Waste Product Acquisition, Home Beautification" committee, the commercial department is responsible for acquiring waste products, supplying daily necessities and beautification materials; the health department is responsible for publicizing and mobilizing the masses to eliminate the four pests and promote the "Six Haves" (people have toilets, cattle have pens, horses have sheds, pigs and sheep have fences, poultry have nests, ashes have storage), eliminate garbage and waste, and improve environmental sanitation; the social life service team is responsible for painting, whitewashing, and beautifying the home; the savings office is responsible for savings deposits. This approach is very popular among the masses. For example, in just 20 days, Fulong Township in Zhaodong County acquired waste products worth more than 27,000 yuan, and the appearance of the entire township was completely renewed.

At present, the waste product acquisition departments in various parts of this province are continuing to promote existing experiences, making every effort to explore waste product resources, and vigorously launching waste product acquisition work.

    为社会增财富，为群众增收入
    黑龙江省商业系统扩大废品收购的经验
    去年，黑龙江省的废品收购工作出现了一个新的跃进局面。全年收购废品总额达一亿多元。收购的废钢铁、杂铜都相当于1957年的两倍以上。
  这样大的成绩是怎样取得的呢？
  依靠党委领导
  结合中心工作
    这个省的废品收购部门在党委的领导下，根据“援、让、挤”的方针，紧紧结合各个时期党的中心工作，大力收购废品。如工业大跃进以后，就扩大收购以废钢铁、杂铜为主的工业原料，支援了工业的跃进。在“工业抗旱”运动中，牡丹江市委书记亲自挂帅，在全市范围内掀起废品回收运动，增大了杂铜、废钢铁的收购量，推动了废品收购工作。
    展开宣传、发动群众
    为了把收购废品的意义作到家喻户晓，发动群众积极出售废品，全省各地收购部门通过实物展览、幻灯、快板、广播、黑板报等二十多种通俗易懂的形式，在群众中展开了广泛深入的宣传。通过宣传，使广大群众进一步了解到收集和出售废品对支援国家建设和增加个人收入的好处，有力地促进了全省废品收购工作的顺利开展。
    突击运动与经常收购相结合
    在工农业生产全面跃进的情况下，为了便利群众出售废品，收购部门采取了“钻空隙、挤时间”和结合中心工作开展突击收购的办法，收到了很大效果。省人民委员会、商业厅为了掀起废品突击收购运动，曾下六次指示，使突击收购运动一个接一个，扩大了废品收购数量，支援了中心工作。如去年8月份在开展突击收购运动中，全省共收杂铜七百二十六吨，相当于1月至7月收购量的总和。
    收购部门经常带货下乡，一面收购废品，一面供应日用品；群众用废品卖钱、换东西，大大便利了群众，有利于开展收购工作。
    攒、拣、挖
    各地收购部门根据废品分散的特点，在充分发动群众的基础上，采用了“攒”“拣”“挖”的办法。
    “攒”就是发动群众积攒废品。具体作法是利用旧木箱或旧竹筐篓，写上“聚宝盆”，放在固定地点，动员群众把日常收集到的废品随时放入，到一定时候卖给废品收购部门。到去年年底，全省已有一百多万户居民建立了“聚宝盆”，全省通过“聚宝盆”的形式，共收购废品价值五百三十六万多元。
      “拣”就是发动群众随时注意拣拾废品。哈尔滨市去年仅废纸一项，就发动群众拣了五十多万斤，价值二万多元。
      “挖”就是挖掘地下及一切潜在资源。去年全省挖掘出各种废品总值达三百三十九万元，其中杂铜六百多吨，废钢铁四万七千多吨。
     美化家庭
    “收购废品，美化家庭”是广东省新会县首创的一种收购方法，黑龙江商业系统在全省普遍推广和发展了这一经验。具体作法是：在党委的统一领导下，各有关部门分工协作组成“收购废品、美化家庭”委员会，商业部门负责收购废品、供应生活用品和美化材料；卫生部门负责宣传发动群众除四害、兴“六有”（人有厕所、牛有栏、马有棚、猪羊有圈、禽有窝、灰有库），清除垃圾废物改善环境卫生，社会生活服务组负责油漆粉刷、美化家庭；储蓄所负责储蓄存款。这种作法很受群众欢迎。如肇东县福隆乡仅用二十天时间，就收购废品价值二万七千多元，并使全乡面貌焕然一新。
    目前，这个省各地废品收购部门正在继续推广现有经验，千方百计地发掘废品资源，大力展开废品收购工作。
