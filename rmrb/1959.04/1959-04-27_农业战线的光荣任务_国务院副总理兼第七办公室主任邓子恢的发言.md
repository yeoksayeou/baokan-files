Comrades:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government.

The agricultural front, like other fronts of socialist construction, launched a great leap forward in 1958. Grain, cotton, and flue-cured tobacco production doubled. With the exception of jute and kenaf, the increase in other major crops was at least 20%. Forestry, animal husbandry, land reclamation, and meteorological undertakings also achieved significant development. The total value of agricultural output increased by 64% in one year. Such high-speed development is indeed an unprecedented leap forward. However, as Premier Zhou stated in his report, "For a country with a population of over 600 million, the level of industry and agriculture we have reached is still very low. To meet the enormous needs of economic development and the improvement of people's lives, we must continue to work hard." 1959 is a crucial year in the three years of hard struggle. We must continue to leap forward on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, along the path opened up in 1958, and strive for an even greater harvest in 1959. The grain, cotton, and agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production targets proposed by Vice Premier Li Fuchun in his report must be strived for and overfulfilled. This is a glorious and arduous task for the agricultural front, and we must make the greatest efforts to achieve this task.

Now, I would like to express some opinions on the following points:

	Increased Production Measures Must Be Adapted to Local Conditions, Time, and Crops

I.	Comprehensively implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture in accordance with local conditions and launch a large-scale high-yield field movement.

In 1958, the sown area of grain and cotton was not more than in 1957, but the total output of grain and cotton doubled. This shows that the bumper harvest in 1958 was not due to the expansion of cultivated land area, but to the unprecedented increase in yield per unit area. The fundamental factor in increasing yield per unit area is the encouragement of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants on the basis of agricultural collectivization, coupled with the comprehensive and conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. Rational close planting in the "Eight-Point Charter" is the central key to increasing yield per unit area. Why can close planting of crops increase production by maintaining more plants on the same cultivated land area? This is because crops need to absorb fertilizer and water from the soil through their roots, absorb other nutrients from the air through their leaves, and carry out "photosynthesis" under sunlight to produce vegetative organic matter in order to promote crop growth. Air and sunlight are available everywhere on the earth, and the soil also contains a lot of fertilizer and water. We implement rational close planting, planting more plants on the same area, in order to maximize the utilization of existing soil fertility, water, and the inexhaustible air and sunlight in the air to promote crop growth. If the planting is too sparse, the plants are too few, which is equivalent to wasting the available fertilizer, water, air, and sunlight. But if the planting is too dense, the row spacing is too small, so that the branches and leaves are not ventilated and light, cannot carry out photosynthesis, and the roots fight each other, but make the crops unable to grow normally. In this way, even if there are many plants, but each plant does not bear many ears, or the seeds are very few and very small, the result is that it cannot increase production, and even reduce production and harvest failure. Therefore, close planting must strive to be reasonable, must maintain a certain row spacing, so that crops can be ventilated, light, and the roots have room to stretch, to achieve "seedlings do not deceive seedlings," this is one aspect. On the other hand, when crops carry out "photosynthesis", in addition to air and sunlight, they also need sufficient fertilizer and water. The general reserves in the existing soil are insufficient, and the barren land is even worse, so that it cannot meet the needs of high-yield close planting of crops. This requires deep plowing to improve the soil, fertilization, and irrigation to ensure that crops are "well-fed and well-watered." The more dense the planting, the more these tasks need to be strengthened. Before sowing crops, we must also select excellent varieties. During the growth period, we also need to pay attention to field management and plant protection work to ensure the safe growth of crops. Therefore, close planting cannot be carried out in isolation. It must require soil, fertilizer, water, seed, protection, management and other work to be fully followed up to achieve high yield, otherwise it is impossible to achieve the effectiveness of close planting. It can be seen that the implementation of close planting must adhere to the principle of "adapting to local conditions, adapting to the time, and adapting to the crops." The degree of close planting must be determined separately according to different regions, different soil water sources, different climatic conditions, different cultivation levels, different crop varieties, and crop characteristics. It must not be mechanically applied everywhere with a single specification. Anything that meets this principle is called rational close planting, which can achieve high yield. Otherwise, it is called unreasonable, which cannot achieve high yield, but will reduce production and even harvest failure.

In 1958, the vast majority of places in the country implemented close planting, and the planting density of various crops was increased to varying degrees. The fact that agricultural production has made a great leap forward proves that the vast majority of close planting is successful. But on the other hand, some farmland did suffer losses due to being planted too densely. At the same time, there are still some places that maintain the old habit of sparse planting, which affects the should-be increase in production. In addition, a more common shortcoming in close planting in 1958 was that more attention was paid to the number of plants and the number of ears, while less attention was paid to increasing the yield per plant. We must take a correct attitude and summarize the experience of 1958: affirm that rational close planting is the central link to improving the yield per unit area of crops, the old habit of sparse planting must be changed; all successful close planting experiences in 1958 must be actively promoted; failures must be resolutely changed. Those experiments that are valuable but have not yet been effective can continue to be carried out in small experimental fields, but they must not be blindly promoted before the experiment is successful. In addition to maintaining an appropriate plant density when implementing close planting, in the future, more attention should be paid to increasing the yield per plant, so that the ears are more numerous and larger, and the seeds are more numerous and full. For the promotion of these advanced experiences, on the one hand, we must take a positive advocacy attitude, and cannot let it go; at the same time, we must implement the mass line, consult with the masses in advance, respect the opinions of old peasants, and decide through full discussion by the masses. It is completely wrong and not allowed to enforce it without consulting with the masses.

Just as close planting is so, so should the implementation of other technical measures. We must, on the basis of earnestly summing up the experience of 1958, correctly, comprehensively, and in accordance with local conditions, implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, launch a large-scale high-yield field movement, and strive for a greater harvest this year.

	We Must Resolutely Fight Against Natural Disasters

II.	Resolutely overcome natural disasters and ensure both bumper harvests and good yields.

Agriculture is greatly affected by climatic conditions, and changes in climate cannot be completely controlled by people's will. This creates considerable long-term instability in agricultural production. China is also a vast country, and it is impossible to require that the weather is always favorable in all parts of the vast land. 1958 was a year of great agricultural production, but the area affected by natural disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, and insects reached 470 million mu nationwide. After a tenacious struggle against drought and flood, 100 million mu were still affected by disasters, resulting in reduced production or crop failure. What about this year? In the Northeast region, there was very little snowfall last winter, and there has not been much rainfall since the beginning of spring. At present, the soil moisture content of most cultivated land is not good enough, and we must fight drought for sowing. On April 10, Anhui, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other provinces and cities suffered from rainstorms and hail, and some winter wheat, rapeseed and early rice seedlings were also damaged. This shows that to achieve a bumper harvest, we must continue to fight tenaciously against natural disasters.

In the great leap forward in 1958, according to the newly built water conservancy projects, the irrigation area can be expanded by 480 million mu. A number of water conservancy projects were also built last winter and this spring, which has enhanced the material basis for fighting drought and flood disasters this year. However, it must also be seen that large and medium-sized water conservancy projects often cannot fully exert their due irrigation benefits in the year of construction, and even in the next two or three years, because after the reservoir project or the gate dam project is built, it is necessary to build canals and level the land, otherwise, the water will still not flow to the farmland. Therefore, this year, we should first concentrate our efforts on these projects to do a good job in repairing channels and leveling land, and improve the water storage capacity as much as possible, so that these projects can give full play to the irrigation benefits. This is more effective than building new projects. Especially in the current situation of relatively tight rural labor, this should be done even more. As for the areas where there are relatively few water conservancy projects, new projects should continue to be built.

To ensure agricultural production, it is necessary to fight against disasters such as floods, droughts, winds, and hail, as well as against disasters such as diseases, pests, and lodging. In the current situation of insufficient pesticides and agricultural machinery, we must also "combine indigenous and foreign methods" to manufacture a large number of "indigenous pesticides" and "indigenous machinery." This can be done by many counties and people's communes themselves. We must vigorously manufacture them. Any thoughts of despising these "indigenous" things are harmful.

A bumper harvest must also ensure a good harvest and ensure proper management and proper use. During the autumn harvest of 1958, rural labor was very tight, and the people's communes had just been built, and the organizational management system was very unsound. The harvesting of agricultural crops such as grain, cotton, oil, and sugar was very rough. Some of them suffered losses due to poor storage or improper use after harvesting. "A bumper harvest was not a complete bumper harvest," which is a lesson that must be deeply remembered. China has a large cultivated land area. If a few tens of kilograms are lost per mu, the sum is hundreds of billions of kilograms. How alarming is this number?! Therefore, this year, before each harvest season, we must conscientiously do a good job in various preparatory work such as "harvesting, threshing, storing, and managing" to ensure both a bumper harvest and a good yield.

At present, for summer-harvested crops such as winter wheat and rapeseed, we must conscientiously do a good job in preventing wind, hail, late frost, mold rain, diseases and insects, and lodging to ensure a bumper wheat harvest; and conscientiously do a good job in various preparations before harvesting to ensure a bumper wheat season, so that "every grain returns home." This will strive for a bumper harvest in the first harvest season this year, and fire the first shot for the great leap forward this year.

	Produce More Non-Staple Foods

III.	Implement diversified operations and develop non-staple food production.

The people's communes must correctly implement the production policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production, as stipulated by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The development of commune-run industries should first start with industries that directly serve local agricultural production, such as agricultural product processing and the manufacture of agricultural tools and fertilizers. In addition to meeting the needs of the commune, the agricultural products (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery) produced by the commune should also develop commodity production to meet the needs of cities and national exports. Only in this way can we meet the needs of national economic development and the improvement of people's lives; and only in this way can we increase the income of the people's communes and members, so that they can be consolidated and developed day by day.

I would like to focus on the issue of non-staple food production here. Due to the great leap forward in industry, the number of employees increased by 8 million in 1958 compared with 1957. With the rapid increase in the population of urban industrial and mining areas and the increase in people's purchasing power, the demand for non-staple foods in cities has greatly increased; and due to the great leap forward in agriculture and the establishment of rural public canteens, the demand for non-staple foods in rural areas has also greatly increased. China is a country with a population of over 600 million. If each person eats one more catty of meat, half a catty of oil, and five eggs per month, they will eat 4 billion catties of meat, 1 million tons of oil, and 20 billion eggs more in half a year. How alarming is this number?! In 1958, the people's communes once relaxed sideline occupations and non-staple food production because of the relatively tight labor force and the production arrangement was not comprehensive enough, only paying attention to grain and cotton production. This has also increased the tension in the supply of some non-staple foods. Therefore, the people's communes are required to vigorously develop sideline occupations and non-staple food production while increasing the production of grain and cotton this year. Around large and medium-sized cities, non-staple food production bases should be established. In addition to supplying the needs of commune members and farm workers, the people's communes and state-owned farms must regard supplying urban non-staple foods as their own glorious task.

	People's Communes Will Further Demonstrate Their Superiority

IV.	Continue to do a good job in the rectification and construction of people's communes and further demonstrate the superiority of people's communes.

In the autumn of 1958, as soon as the people's communes were built, they fully demonstrated their greater superiority than the advanced cooperatives in the great movement of autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, autumn sowing, and the whole people running iron and steel. At that time, the workload of autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing increased several times compared with previous years. Without the people's communes, it would be unimaginable to shoulder such heavy "three autumn works" while running iron and steel on a large scale. However, the time when the people's communes were built was still very short. The vast majority of communes were busy with the intense work of "three autumns" and running iron and steel on a large scale as soon as they were built. For consolidating organizations, improving systems, and the new problems related to production, distribution, life welfare, and business management caused by the establishment of communes, there was no time to solve them, so it was inevitable to produce some shortcomings.

For several months, various places have carried out the work of rectifying communes according to the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes. The vast number of cadres and the masses have unified their understanding that the nature of people's communes at the present stage is still socialist collective ownership. When the people's communes were first established, some cadres and the masses once confused collective ownership with ownership by the whole people, and also confused the two historical development stages of socialism and communism, and were eager to transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and were eager to transition from socialism to communism. These confused ideas began to be clarified in the process of rectifying communes for several months. At the same time, it also enabled the vast number of cadres and the masses to correctly understand that the people's communes must still implement the principle of distribution according to work and equivalent exchange at the present stage, overcome the tendency of petty-bourgeois egalitarianism that once appeared in the actual work of some places, and correctly combine ideological and political work with caring for the material interests of commune members. This has greatly promoted the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants. After these months of rectifying communes, it is more obvious that the people's communes must implement unified leadership, decentralized management, and decentralized accounting. That is to say, in the people's commune of socialist collective ownership, all levels of the commune, production brigade, production team, and production small team must achieve reasonable division of labor, clear responsibilities, decentralized management, and decentralized accounting. In the process of rectifying communes in these months, many successful experiences of the original advanced agricultural cooperatives were accepted, the principles of running communes democratically and thriftily were reiterated, the management system of the people's communes was further improved, the phenomenon of extravagance and waste was overcome, and the work style of cadres was also improved. All of this will play a decisive role in the consolidation of the people's communes. Now, the work of rectifying communes in various places has not yet ended. In the near future, each people's commune will also hold a congress of party members and a congress of commune members to summarize the work of rectifying communes, inspect and arrange production, clear the accounts of the commune, and elect leaders and managers at all levels. We must continue to do a good job in rectifying communes, so that the people's communes can be more consolidated and better built. In 1957, the agricultural cooperatives, after rectifying work styles and communes, implemented democratic commune management, decentralized power of the communes and teams, and promoted the "three guarantees" system of contracting work, contracting production, and contracting costs, improved the level of business management, and cadres improved their work style. On this basis, coupled with the encouragement of the Party's general line, the great leap forward in agriculture in 1958 appeared. It can be believed that the people's communes, after these months of rectification and construction, will further demonstrate their superiority in this year's great leap forward in agriculture. This is a reliable guarantee for achieving a greater harvest in agriculture this year.

	The Appearance of Our Rivers and Mountains is Gradually Changing

Finally, I would also like to briefly explain the treatment of the Yellow River.

Since the Second Session of the First National People's Congress passed the resolution on the comprehensive plan for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's water damage and developing the Yellow River's water conservancy, the work of treating the Yellow River has entered a new historical period. Encouraged by the Yellow River treatment plan, especially under the promotion of the national great leap forward last year, large-scale treatment work has been launched in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yellow River.

The fundamental problem of the Yellow River is the problem of sediment. The basis of Yellow River treatment is soil and water conservation work. When the Yellow River treatment plan was proposed, only individual villages, individual mountain gullies, and individual experimental stations had achieved effective soil and water conservation. After several years of efforts, by June 1958, the cumulative engineering work had been done, and it is estimated that it can initially control the area of soil erosion to 158,000 square kilometers, accounting for about one-third of the area of soil erosion in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. The original plan to control 190,000 square kilometers by 1967 may be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule.

On the basis of soil and water conservation, the treatment and comprehensive utilization projects of tributaries are also actively being carried out. The original plan was to build ten large reservoirs on the main tributaries before 1967. Now, the large reservoirs that have been started or are about to be started include: the Dafosi Reservoir on the Jing River, the Xiajingyou Reservoir (renamed Xiashijiazhuang Reservoir) on the Fen River, and the Guxian Reservoir on the Luo River. Countless small reservoirs have been widely built by the masses on the tributaries.

The original plan was to build a total of 46 cascade projects on the main stream, of which the five key projects to be built before 1967 were Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia, Qingtongxia, Dukoutang, and Taohuayu. Now, except for Taohuayu, the other four key projects have been started. The Sanmenxia key project, which is enthusiastically concerned by the people of the whole country, has been successfully dammed last year and is expected to start flood control in 1960 and power generation in 1961. In addition, the Weishan key project in Shandong Province has also been started.

The situation of developing irrigation in the upper, middle, and lower reaches has also broken the original plan. The Yintao project in Gansu is opening up a mountain river channel of 1,400 kilometers, which is expected to divert water by 150 cubic meters per second and irrigate more than 10 million mu of cultivated land. On the basis of fully developing medium and small-sized water conservancy projects in the lower reaches, combined with large-scale projects, it is required to achieve unified planning and mutual assistance for the water sources and groundwater of the Yellow, Hai, Huai, Yi, and Si rivers and fully utilize them. In 1958, the sluices that have been built on both sides of the Yellow River include: the Xinxiang nearby People's Victory Canal New Sluice, the Zhengzhou nearby Gangli Yellow Diversion Sluice, the Lankao County nearby Sanyizhai Yellow Diversion Sluice, the Fengqiu County nearby Dagong Yellow Diversion Sluice, the Dong'e County nearby Weishan Yellow Diversion Sluice, the Lijin County nearby Dayuzhang Yellow Diversion Sluice and other six large sluices. These sluices have begun to play a role in the water conservancy of the North China Plain and will further play a huge role.

In addition, while treating the Yellow River, large-scale work has also been carried out on other major rivers. In the Huai River basin, medium and small-sized reservoirs are widely built in the upper and middle reaches, and the large reservoirs such as Zhaopinglu and Linhuaigang continue to be built, so that floods can be further controlled; in the plain area, the river network engineering has begun, and a way to solve the problem of internal waterlogging has been initially explored; in the lower reaches, the "Huai River Water Diversion to the North" and the Huai River Diversion to the Yi River project have begun, comprehensively solving the water and drought disasters in northern Jiangsu. In the Hai River basin, on the basis of widely carrying out small-scale projects in recent years, the Xihe Water Storage Project, the Hai River Tide Barrier, and the Sinusi flood diversion project have been built, and large reservoirs on the upper reaches of the Hutuo River, the Daqing River South Branch, and the Chaobai River are being built, so that the work of fundamentally controlling the Hai River has taken a big step forward. The basin planning and research work of the Yangtze River is also actively being carried out, and the Danjiangkou Reservoir, the main water conservancy hub for fundamentally controlling the Han River, has been started.

The above situation shows that the appearance of our rivers and mountains is gradually changing, and the great ideal of our people to tame rivers will gradually be realized. However, before the rivers are completely tamed, we must always maintain a high degree of vigilance against floods, especially the water conservancy projects built in 1958 have not been tested by floods, a large number of newly built projects have not been completed, and some old projects have been poorly repaired in winter, so this year's flood control work will be more important and more difficult than in previous years. At present, the south is about to enter the flood season, and the north is not far from the flood season. All localities must overcome paralysis, prepare for flood control as soon as possible, improve flood control organizations, prepare flood control materials, and ensure flood control victory to protect this year's great agricultural harvest and great leap forward!

Comrades, this is all I have to say. Please criticize and correct any inappropriate points.

专栏：

    农业战线的光荣任务
    国务院副总理兼第七办公室主任邓子恢的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理关于政府工作的报告。
    农业战线和社会主义建设的其他各个战线一样，在一九五八年展开了一个大跃进的局面，粮食、棉花和烤烟增产一倍，除了黄麻、洋麻以外，其他各种主要农作物增产的比例，最少都在百分之二十以上；林业、畜牧业、垦殖业和气象事业也有显著的发展；农业总产值一年增长百分之六十四。这样高速度的发展，的确是史无前例的大跃进。但是，也正如周总理在报告中所说：“对于一个六亿多人口的国家说来，我国工农业现在达到的水平仍然是很低的，为了满足经济发展和人民生活改善的巨大需要，我们必须继续进行艰苦的奋斗。”一九五九年是苦战三年中具有决定性的一年，我们必须在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，沿着一九五八年所开辟的道路，继续跃进，争取一九五九年更大的丰收。李富春副总理在报告中所提的粮食、棉花以及农、林、牧业各项生产指标，必须力争完成和超额完成。这是农业战线光荣而艰巨的任务，我们必须尽最大的努力，为实现这个任务而奋斗。
    现在，我想就下面几点发表一些意见：
    增产措施必须因地因时因物制宜
    一、全面地因地制宜地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”、开展大面积丰产田运动。
    一九五八年粮、棉播种面积并不比一九五七年多，但粮、棉总产量却翻了一番，这说明一九五八年的大丰收并不是耕地面积的扩大，而是依靠单位面积产量的空前提高。提高单位面积产量的根本因素，是在农业合作化的基础上，加上党的社会主义建设总路线鼓舞了广大农民的革命干劲，从而全面地认真地推行了农业“八字宪法”。而“八字宪法”中的合理密植又是构成单位面积产量提高的中心关键。为什么农作物实行密植，在同一耕地面积上保持较多植株就能够增产呢？这是因为农作物在生长过程中需要通过根部从土壤中吸收肥分和水分，通过叶部从空气中吸收其他养分，并在阳光照射下进行“光合作用”，制成植性有机物质，才能促进作物的生长。空气和阳光是大地上到处都有的，在土壤里又蕴藏着许多肥分和水分，我们实行合理密植，在同一面积上种上较多的植株，就是为了最大限度地利
  用现有土壤的肥力、水分和空中无尽藏的空气、阳光，来促进农作物的生长。如果种植过稀，植株过少，就等于浪费可能利用的肥分、水分、空气和阳光。但是如果过度密植，株行距过小，以致枝叶不通风、不透光，不能起光合作用，根系互相打架，反而使农作物不能正常生长，这样即使植株多，而每一植株结穗不多，或者子粒很少、很小，结果也是不能增产，甚至反而减产失收，所以密植必须力求合理，必须保持一定的株行距，使农作物能够通风、透光，根系有伸展的余地，做到“苗不欺苗”，这是一方面。另一方面，农作物进行“光合作用”时，除了空气和阳光以外，还需要有足够的肥分和水分。这在现有土壤里一般蕴藏量是不足的，瘠薄土地就更差，从而不能满足农作物密植高产的需求，这就需要深翻改土、施肥、灌溉，保证农作物“吃饱喝足”，越是密植，就越要加强这些工作。在农作物播种前还得选用优良品种，在生长期间，还需要注意田间管理和植物保护工作，使农作物安全生长。所以密植不能孤立地进行，必须要求土、肥、水、种、保、管等工作全面跟上去，才能达到高产，否则不可能收到密植的成效。由此可见，实行密植必须坚持“因地制宜、因时制宜、因物制宜”的原则。密植程度必须根据不同的地区，不同的土壤水源，不同的气候条件，不同的耕作水平，不同的作物品种和作物特性等来分别规定，决不能机械地用一个规格到处乱套。凡是合乎这个原则的就叫做合理密植，就能达到高产，反之，就叫做不合理，就不能达到高产，反而要减产甚至失收。
    一九五八年，全国极大多数地方都推行了密植，各种农作物种植的密度都有不同程度的提高，农业生产大跃进的事实证明绝大多数的密植是成功的。但是另一方面，确实也有部分农田，由于种得过密而遭受损失。同时，也还有一些地方仍然保持着稀植的旧习惯，影响到产量应有的提高。另外，一九五八年在密植中较普遍的缺点，则是只注意植株多、穗数多，而注意提高单株产量则较少。我们必须采取正确的态度，总结一九五八年的经验：肯定合理密植是提高农作物单位面积产量的中心环节，稀植的旧习惯必须改变；凡是一九五八年成功的密植经验必须积极推广；失败的必须坚决改变，那些试验有价值但还没有成效的可以在小块试验田里继续进行试验，但在没有试验成功以前决不能盲目推广。在实行密植时除了保持适当的植株密度以外，今后要更多地注意单株产量的提高，做到结穗又多、又大，子粒又多、又饱。对于推广这些先进经验，一方面必须采取积极提倡的态度，不能放任自流；同时又必须贯彻群众路线，事先和群众商量，尊重老农意见，通过群众充分讨论来决定，不同群众商量，而强制执行，是完全错误的，也是不许可的。
    密植如此，推行其他技术措施都应该如此，我们必须在认真地总结一九五八年经验的基础
  上，正确地、全面地、因地制宜地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，开展大面积丰产田运动，争取今年更大的丰收。
    要坚决地同自然灾害作斗争
    二、坚决战胜自然灾害，保证丰产又丰收。
    农业受气候条件的影响极大，气候的变化还不能完全由人们的意志来控制，这就造成农业生产相当长期的不稳定性。我国又是一个幅员广大的国家，要求在辽阔的国土上，处处都风调雨顺，更是不可能。一九五八年是农业生产大丰收的一年，但是遭受到水旱风虫等自然灾害的面积，全国还达四亿七千万亩，经过抗旱防涝的顽强斗争，仍有一亿亩成灾，以致减产或失收。今年怎样呢？东北地区，去年冬季下雪很少，开春以来降雨也不多，目前大部分耕地的墒情不够好，必须抗旱播种。四月十日，安徽、浙江和上海等省、市遭受暴风雨和冰雹的灾害，有一部分冬麦、油菜和早稻的秧苗也受了损失。这说明要争取大丰收，必须继续顽强地同自然灾害作斗争。
    一九五八年大跃进中，按新建的水利工程估算，可以扩大灌溉面积四亿八千万亩，去冬今春又兴修了一批水利工程，这就为今年同水旱灾害作斗争增强了物质基础。但是，也必须看到，大中型水利工程，在兴修的当年，甚至在以后二、三年内，往往还不能完全发挥它应有的灌溉效益，因为水库工程或者闸坝工程修起来之后，还必须修好渠道，平整好土地，否则，水还是流不到农田里去。因此，今年应该首先集中力量在这些工程上做好补修渠道、平整土地等工作，并尽可能提高蓄水量，使这些工程充分发挥灌溉效益。这比起新修工程来是事半功倍的。特别是在当前农村劳动力比较紧张的情况下，更应该这样做，至于水利工程兴修比较少的地区，则应该继续兴修新的工程。
    要保证农业丰产，不仅要同水旱风雹等灾害作斗争，还要同病虫倒伏等灾害作斗争。在当前农药农械不足的情况下，也必须“土洋并举”，大量制造“土农药”和“土器械”，这是许多县和人民公社自己的力量能够办到的，必须大力制造，对于这些“土”的东西，任何轻视的思想都是有害的。
    丰产还必须保证丰收、保证妥善管理，使用得当。一九五八年秋收的时候，农村劳动力十分紧张，人民公社又刚刚建成，组织管理制度很不健全，粮食、棉花、油料、糖料等农作物的收割都很粗糙，收割后有的又因保管不善或者使用不当而遭受损失。“丰产没有完全丰收”，这是必须深刻记取的教训。我国耕地面积大，一亩地损失几十斤，加在一起，就是几百亿千把亿斤，这个数字何等惊人？！因此，今年必须在每一个收获季节以前，切实做好“收、打、藏、管”等各项准备工作，保证丰产又丰收。
    目前对于冬麦油菜等夏收作物，必须切实做好防风、防雹、防晚霜、防霉雨、防病虫、防倒伏等工作，以保证麦收丰产；并切实做好收割前各项准备工作，保证麦季丰收，做到“颗粒还家”，这样来争取今年第一个收获季节大丰收，为今年大跃进打响第一炮。
    更多地增产副食品
    三、实行多种经营，发展副食品生产。
    人民公社必须正确地贯彻执行党的八届六中全会所规定的工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的生产方针。发展社办工业，应该是首先兴办直接为当地农业生产服务的工业，如农产品加工和农具、肥料制造等。公社生产的农业产品（包括林、牧、副、渔各业）除了解决本社的需要以外，还应该发展商品性的生产，以供应城市和国家出口的需要。只有这样，才能满足国民经济发展和人民生活改善的需要；也只有这样，才能增加人民公社和社员的收入，使它日益巩固和发展起来。
    我在这里着重谈一下副食品生产的问题。由于工业的大跃进，职工人数一九五八年比一九五七年增加了八百万人。随着城市工矿区人口迅速的增加，人民购买力的提高，城市副食品的需要量就大大增长了；也由于农业的大跃进，农村公共食堂的建立，农村副食品的需要量也大大增加了。我国是一个六亿多人口的国家，每人每月多吃一斤肉、半斤油、五个鸡蛋，半年就要多吃掉四十亿斤肉、一百万吨油、二百亿个鸡蛋，这个数字又是何等惊人？！一九五八年人民公社曾经一度因为劳动力比较紧张，生产安排不够全面，只注意抓粮棉生产，而放松了副业和副食品生产，这也增加了某些副食品供应的紧张现象。因此，要求人民公社，今年在增产粮食、棉花的同时，必须大力发展副业和副食品的生产，在大中城市的周围，应该建立起副食品生产基地，人民公社和国营农场，除了供应社员和农场职工生活需要以外，必须把供应城市副食品当做自己的一项光荣任务。
    人民公社必将进一步发挥优越性
    四、继续做好人民公社的整顿和建设工作，进一步发挥人民公社的优越性。
    一九五八年秋季，人民公社刚一建成，在当时秋收、秋耕、秋种和全民办钢铁的大运动中，就充分表现出它比高级合作社具有更大的优越性。当时秋收、秋耕和秋种的工作量，比往年增加了几倍，如果没有人民公社，要在大办钢铁的同时，担负那样繁重的“三秋工作”是难以想象的。但是人民公社建成的时间毕竟还很短，绝大多数公社刚一建成就忙于“三秋”和大办钢铁的紧张工作，对于巩固组织、健全制度、以及由于建立公社而产生的有关生产，分配、生活福利、经营管理等方面的新问题，一时也来不及解决，从而产生一些缺点也是难以避免的。
    几个月以来，各地根据党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议进行了整社工作，广大干部和群众对于人民公社在现阶段仍然是属于社会主义集体所有制的性质在认识上已经统一起来了。当人民公社建立初期，一部分干部和群众曾经一度把集体所有制和全民所有制混淆起来，把社会主义和共产主义这两个历史发展阶段也混淆起来，并且急于从集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，急于从社会主义过渡到共产主义，这些糊涂观念，在几个月整社过程中开始得到了澄清。同时，也使广大干部和群众正确地认识到人民公社在现阶段还必须实行按劳分配、等价交换的原则，克服了某些地方在实际工作中一度出现的小资产阶级平均主义的倾向，并且正确地把思想政治工作和关心社员物质利益结合起来，这就大大发扬了广大农民的劳动积极性。经过这几个月的整社，更加明显地看出，人民公社必须实行统一领导，分级管理，还必须实行分级核算。这就是说在社会主义集体所有制的人民公社中，公社、生产大队、生产队和生产小队各级都要做到合理分工，权责分明，分级管理，分级核算。在这几个月的整社过程中，并接受了原来高级农业社的许多成功的经验，重申民主办社和勤俭办社的原则，进一步健全了人民公社的管理制度，克服铺张浪费现象，干部的作风也有了改进。所有这一切，对于人民公社的巩固将起决定性的作用。现在，各地的整社工作还没有结束，各个人民公社在最近期间，还要分别召开一次公社的党员代表大会和社员代表大会，总结整社工作，检查和布置生产，清理公社账目，选举各级领导人员和管理人员。我们必须继续做好整社工作，使人民公社更加巩固起来，更好地建设起来，一九五七年农业合作社，经过整风、整社，贯彻了民主办社，实行社队分权，推行了包工、包产、包成本的“三包”制度，提高了经营管理水平，干部改进了作风，在这个基础上加上党的总路线的鼓舞，从而出现了一九五八年农业大跃进，可以相信，人民公社经过了这几个月的整顿建设以后，一定会在今年农业大跃进中进一步发挥它的优越性，这是实现今年农业更大丰收的可靠保证。
    我国江河面貌正在逐渐改变
    最后，我还想对于黄河的治理情况，作一简要说明。
    自从第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的决议后，治理黄河工作进入了一个新的历史时期。在治黄规划的鼓舞下，特别是在去年全国大跃进的推动下，黄河上、中、下游都展开了大规模的治理工作。
    黄河的根本问题是泥沙问题，治黄的基础是水土保持工作。在提出治黄规划时，保持水土著有成效的还只是个别村、个别山沟和个别实验站，经过几年来的努力，到一九五八年六月累计，已做的工程，估计可以初步控制水土流失的面积为十五万八千多平方公里，约占黄河中游水土流失面积的三分之一，原定到一九六七年控制十九万平方公里的规划有可能提前完成和超额完成。
    在水土保持的基础上，支流的治理和综合利用工程也正在积极开展。原规划在一九六七年以前，要在主要支流上修建大型水库十座，现在已经开工或即将开工的大型水库有：泾河上的大佛寺水库、汾河上的下静游水库（改名为下石家庄水库）和洛河上的故县水库等三座。各支流上由群众广泛举办的小型水库就不胜枚举了。
    原计划在干流上共将修建四十六个梯级工程，其中在一九六七年以前修建的有三门峡、刘家峡、青铜峡、渡口堂和桃花峪等五处枢纽工程，现在除桃花峪以外，其他四处枢纽工程都已开工了。全国人民热烈关怀的三门峡枢纽工程已经在去年胜利截流，预计将于一九六零年开始拦洪，一九六一年开始发电。此外，山东境内的位山枢纽工程也已开工。
    上、中、下游发展灌溉的形势，也已打破了原来的规划。甘肃的引洮工程，正在开辟长达一千四百公里的山上河道，预计可以引水一百五十秒公方，灌溉一千多万亩耕地。下游在充分开展中、小型水利工程的基础上，结合大型工程，要求做到黄、海、淮、沂、泗等河流
  的水源和地下水能够统筹互济，充分利用。一九五八年在黄河两岸已经修成的水闸有：新乡附近的人民胜利渠新闸，郑州附近的岗李引黄闸，兰考县附近的三义寨引黄闸，封丘县附近的大功引黄闸，东阿县附近的位山引黄闸，利津县附近的打渔张引黄闸等大型水闸六座。这些水闸对于华北平原的水利化已经开始发挥作用，并且将进一步发挥巨大的作用。
    此外，在治理黄河的同时，对于其他几条主要河流，也进行了大规模的工作。在淮河流域，在上、中游广泛修建中小型水库，并继续修建昭平吕、临淮岗等大型水库，使洪水得到进一步控制；在平原地区，开始了河网化的工程，初步摸索到一条解决内涝问题的途径；在下游，开始了“淮水北调”，分淮入沂的工程，综合解决苏北地区的水旱灾害。在海河流域，近年来在广泛开展小型工程的基础上，建成了西河蓄水工程、海河挡潮闸和四女寺分洪工程，并正在修建滹沱河、大清河南支和潮白河上游的大型水库，使根治海河工作大大迈进一步。长江的流域规划和研究工作也正在积极进行，根治汉水的主要水利枢纽丹江口水库已经动工兴建。
    以上情况说明，我国江河的面貌正在逐渐改变，我国人民驯服江河的伟大理想必将逐步实现。但是，在江河没有完全驯服以前，我们对于洪水还必须经常保持高度警惕性，特别是在一九五八年修好的水利工程，未经过洪水考验，大量新修工程还没有竣工，有些旧工程冬修较差，因此今年的防汛工作将比往年更为重要，更为艰巨。目前南方即将进入汛期，北方距汛期也不远，各地必须克服麻痹思想，及早做好防汛的准备工作，健全防汛组织，准备好防汛器材，保证防汛胜利，以保卫今年的农业大丰收，大跃进！
    各位代表，我的发言就是这一些，不妥之处，请各位批评指正。
