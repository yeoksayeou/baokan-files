Teachers Teach Earnestly, Students Learn Earnestly
A New Atmosphere of Teaching and Learning from Each Other Emerges at Fudan University and Zhejiang University

(Our Report) Since the beginning of this semester, the Party organization of Fudan University in Shanghai has paid special attention to leveraging the guiding role of teachers in the teaching process, and the entire school is filled with an atmosphere of teaching well and learning well.

In order to truly teach students well, many veteran teachers have improved their teaching methods in various ways. Professor Zhou Gucheng not only introduced many different views on logical problems in the current academic world when teaching logic courses, but also elaborated on his own views, and launched discussions among students in accordance with the spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Professor Yan Zhixian of the Chemistry Department teaches inorganic chemistry and qualitative analysis courses to first-year students. Students reported that he can explain complex theoretical problems very clearly, and everyone is satisfied. Zhou Tongqing, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and professor of the Physics Department, teaches general physics to first-year students for six hours a week, but he spends seventeen hours preparing for lessons. Many teachers also pay special attention to introducing the latest scientific achievements and academic knowledge at home and abroad to students in teaching.

Teachers not only lecture earnestly in the classroom, but also go deep among students to provide guidance, understand their learning difficulties and requirements, and help students solve them in time. Liu Zhenfeng, a teacher in the Philosophy Department who teaches dialectical materialism, asks students about their preview situation before each class, and explains based on the problems and requirements of students' learning. Lecturers Liu Dezhong and Cao Youlin of the Foreign Languages ​​Department use vivid facts to guide students to improve their learning methods and improve their learning quality based on the problems reflected by students in their homework and tests. Teachers are even more patient in helping some working-class and peasant students who have learning difficulties. The Physics Department specially compiled a class for the first-year working-class and peasant students with learning difficulties to strengthen the learning and guidance of basic theoretical courses.

Under the enthusiastic teaching of the teachers, the students' learning enthusiasm is very high. The school's library and reading room are often full. The Chinese Department recently investigated the learning situation of more than 80 students in the third grade. Everyone can basically read carefully in accordance with the prescribed teaching requirements, participate in classroom discussions and conduct scientific research. 30% of the students are engaged in research work that they are interested in after reading the designated reference books. After learning the chapter on the Opium War in modern Chinese history, some students in the third grade of the History Department immediately prepared to write a paper on "The Opium War" in conjunction with their studies. When holding a classroom discussion on the issue of the Heavenly Kingdom Land System of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, students posted big-character posters all over the walls of the dormitory to elaborate on various different viewpoints. The students believe that such learning can not only have a deeper understanding of the content of the course, but also enlivens their thinking and improves their ability to think independently.

Under the common requirements of teachers and students throughout the school to teach well and learn well, a new teacher-student relationship of respecting teachers and loving students, and teaching and learning from each other is forming. Many teachers feel that they have gained a lot in specifically guiding students' learning. In order to improve teaching, teachers running to students' dormitories after class and calling students to meetings to solicit opinions has become commonplace. Teachers are excited about the improvement of students' academic performance, and students also attribute their improved academic performance to the teachers' careful guidance. Teachers and students have gradually established a close teacher-student relationship in the teaching process.

(Our Report) After Zhejiang University implemented the Party's education policy, a new atmosphere of respecting teachers and loving students, teaching and learning from each other, and greatly improving teaching quality has emerged. In recent years, in the teaching process, teachers at Zhejiang University, in addition to preparing lessons carefully, have also widely absorbed students' opinions on lecture content and teaching methods.

The Electrical Engineering Teaching and Research Group of the Electrical Engineering Department of Industrial Enterprises adopted the method of segmented review and frequent tutoring to improve students' learning quality, which was generally welcomed by students. The Thermal Engineering Teaching and Research Group of the Mechanical Engineering Department opened a new course "Fluid Mechanics" last semester. Students generally reported that they could not understand it, and the concept of the entire course was unclear. The Party branch held a student symposium and invited the teachers in charge to participate. At the meeting, the students raised many questions. Based on the questions raised by the students, the teachers found many reference books, prepared lessons carefully, and the students were not only very satisfied but also very interested when lecturing. When the first grade of the Industrial and Civil Architecture major in the Civil Engineering Department was taking the "Surveying" course, the effect of the measurement was very low because the time between the class and the actual operation was too long. After the students raised their opinions, it was changed to class in the morning, measurement in the afternoon, and calculation in the evening, which the students reacted very well to. In order to strengthen the guidance for working-class and peasant students, each department's teaching and research group has established a working-class and peasant student tutoring room, and designated special personnel to contact working-class and peasant students. In addition to often going to the self-study room to tutor, many teachers also actively go deep into the student dormitories to tutor. The teachers of the Structural Teaching and Research Group of the Civil Engineering Department, when teaching the "Structural Mechanics" course, because this course is very theoretical and students have difficulty in reviewing, the teachers stipulated two evenings of tutoring time per week according to the students' study plan. The teachers in charge and the tutoring teachers went to the student dormitory to tutor separately and stayed in the office to answer students' difficult questions. Teachers also took the initiative to visit the dormitory when students were sick. The students were very moved by the teachers' enthusiastic guidance and sincere care. They said: "In the past, some of us took a course for a semester and didn't even know the teacher's name, let alone the teacher calling our name. Now, the teachers not only care about our academic and political ideological improvement, but also care about our lives."

Under the new atmosphere of teaching and learning from each other, students have become more modest and serious in their studies. Since the beginning of this semester, all students in the school have formed many study groups and mutual aid groups under the principle of voluntary combination, and hold group leader meetings regularly on a class basis to understand the students' learning situation and arrange students' self-study time. Now, the students' atmosphere of reading is stronger. In the evening, the self-study room and dormitory are crowded with people reviewing their lessons. Many new students also ordered Russian vocabulary words into pocket-sized books, and seized the time to read new words during the gaps before going to the factory to work and before class. Due to the teachers' earnest teaching and responsible guidance, the students also respected the teachers more. Old Professor Yang Yaode of the Electrical Engineering Department went to the factory for production practice with the students, and the students took the initiative to make beds for him. The teachers felt that the students were sincere and lovely, and at the same time, they felt that their responsibilities were even greater. (Huang Keping)

    教师认真教　学生认真学
    复旦大学、浙江大学出现教学相长的新风气
    本报讯　今年开学以来，上海复旦大学党组织特别注意发挥教师在教学过程中的主导作用，全校充满了教好学好的空气。
    为了真正把学生教好，许多老教师都从多方面改进教学方法。周谷城教授在讲授逻辑课程中不仅把当前学术界对逻辑问题的许多不同见解作了介绍，并且阐述自己的观点，发动学生根据百家争鸣的精神开展讨论。化学系教授严志弦为一年级学生开设无机化学与定性分析课程，学生反映，他能十分清楚地讲授复杂的理论问题，大家都感到满意。中国科学院学部委员物理系周同庆教授为一年级学生讲普通物理，每周上课六小时，但他却花了十七小时备课。许多教师还特别注意在教学中，向学生介绍国内外最新的科学成就和学术知识。
    教师们不仅在课堂上认真讲课，而且深入到学生中间辅导，了解学习中的困难和要求，帮助学生及时解决。哲学系担任辩证唯物主义课程的教师刘振丰，每次上课前都要找学生了解他们预习的情况，根据学生学习上存在的问题和要求进行讲解。外文系讲师刘德中、曹又霖等根据学生在作业和测验中反映出来的问题，用生动的事实来指导学生改进学习方法，提高学习质量。对一些学习困难的工农学生，教师们更是不厌其烦地加以帮助。物理系把一年级学习困难的工农学生专编了一个班，加强基础理论课的学习辅导。
    在教师们的热心教导下，学生们学习情绪十分高涨。学校的图书馆、阅览室经常满座。中文系最近调查了三年级的八十多名学生的学习情况，大家基本上都能按照规定的教学要求认真地读书，参加课堂讨论和进行科学研究，30％的人在读完指定学习的参考书外，还从事自己有兴趣的研究工作。历史系三年级的部分学生在学完中国近史代的鸦片战争一章之后，立即准备结合学习写出“鸦片战争”的论文。在举行有关太平天国天朝田亩制度问题的课堂讨论时，学生们在宿舍里贴了满墙满壁的大字报阐述各种不同的观点。学生们认为这样的学习，不仅对课程的内容可以有更加深入的理解，并且活跃了思想，提高了自己独立思考的能力。
    在全校师生教好、学好的共同要求下，一种尊师爱生、教学相长的新的师生关系正在形成。许多教师在具体指导学生学习中，感到自己也很有所得。为了改进教学，教师上课后跑学生宿舍，找学生开会征求意见，已成为普通的事。教师们对学生学习成绩的提高感到兴奋，同学们也把自己学习成绩的上升，归功于教师的悉心教导，教师和学生在教学过程中，已逐渐建立起亲密无间的师生关系。
    本报讯　浙江大学在贯彻执行党的教育方针后，出现了尊师爱生、教学相长、教学质量大大提高的新气象。近年来，浙江大学的教师们，在教学过程中，除了认真备课以外，还广泛吸取学生对讲课内容和教学方法的意见。
    电机系工业企业电器化教研组采用分段复习、经常辅导的办法来提高学生的学习质量，受到学生普遍欢迎。机械系热工教研组上学期新开了一门“流体力学”课，学生普遍反映听不懂，整个课程概念不清，党总支就召开了学生座谈会，邀请任课教师参加，在会上学生们提出很多问题，教师根据学生所提的问题，找了很多参考书，认真备课，讲课时学生不仅很满意，而且很感兴趣。土木系工业民用建筑专业一年级在上“测量学”一课时，因为上课和实际操作相隔时间太长，测量时效果很低，经过学生提意见后，就改为上午上课，下午测量，晚上计算，学生反映很好。为了加强对工农学生的辅导，各系教研组都建立了工农学生辅导室，并指定专人和工农学生联系。很多教师除了经常到自修室辅导外，还主动深入到学生宿舍去辅导。土木系结构教研组教师，在上“结构力学”课时，因为这门课理论性很强，学生复习时比较困难，教师就根据学生的学习计划，规定每周有二个晚上的辅导时间，任课教师和辅导教师分头到学生宿舍辅导和留在办公室给学生回答疑难问题。学生生了病，教师也主动上宿舍去看望。学生对教师们的热情辅导和衷心的关怀都非常感动，他们说：“过去，有的课我们上了一学期，还不知道老师叫什么名字，老师就更无法叫出我们的名字。现在，老师不但关心我们学业和政治思想上的提高，还关心我们的生活。”
    在教学相长的新风气下，学生们对学习更加虚心认真了，从本学期开始，全校学生在自愿结合的原则下，组成了很多学习小组和互助组，以班为单位定期召开小组长会议，了解学生们的学习情况，安排学生自学的时间。现在，学生们的读书空气更浓厚了。晚上，自修室和宿舍都挤满了温习功课的人。很多新学生还把俄文生字订成袖珍小本子，利用上工厂劳动和上课之前的空隙，抓紧时间读生字。由于教师的认真教学、负责辅导，学生对老师也更加尊敬了，电机系老教授杨耀德和学生一起下工厂生产实习，学生主动为他搞床铺。教师们感到学生真诚可爱，同时，也感到自己的责任更大了。　（黄客萍）
