    Vigorously Develop Ferroalloy Industry
    Ministry of Metallurgical Industry Decides to Gradually Establish Ferroalloy Bases
    Shanghai Successfully Trial-Produces Over One Hundred Types of Alloy Steel

    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held a National Ferroalloy Conference, deciding to vigorously develop ferroalloy production, increase the production of sufficient quantities of silicon iron, manganese iron, and various special ferroalloys to meet the needs of this year's Great Leap Forward in the steel industry.

    The conference pointed out that China's ferroalloy industry has made great progress last year. In addition to the construction of several large ferroalloy electric furnaces, various localities have also built a large number of small, simple ferroalloy electric furnaces in light of local conditions, thereby basically meeting the needs of last year's steel production doubling. This year, as steel production increases to 18 million tons, the output of silicon iron, manganese iron, and a few special ferroalloys needs to increase significantly.

    The conference determined to continue to vigorously implement the principle of "walking on two legs" and develop the ferroalloy industry in conjunction with China's resource situation. To this end, in addition to deciding to accelerate the construction of large-scale ferroalloy enterprises, the conference also required all provinces and cities to establish independent factories specializing in smelting ferroalloys, or to establish ferroalloy workshops in steel plants and qualified machinery plants, and to gradually develop into small and medium-sized ferroalloy industrial bases in conjunction with the steel production in various regions. At the same time, all localities should also seize the construction of ferroalloy raw material bases.

    The conference pointed out that existing ferroalloy enterprises still have great production potential to be tapped. At present, the output of many ferroalloy electric furnaces has not reached the design targets, and production efficiency has not been fully utilized. Therefore, the conference called on workers to actively improve technology, carry out a red flag competition centered on improving the utilization coefficient of electric furnaces to achieve high production, high quality, and electricity saving, and to use existing equipment to produce more and better ferroalloys.

    After exchanging the high-yield and electricity-saving experience of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology in smelting silicon iron, as well as the advanced experience of other units in production and infrastructure construction, the conference also specifically stipulated the utilization coefficient and power consumption indicators for small and medium-sized electric furnaces.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 21st: Shanghai's steel industry, which only began mass production of alloy steel last year, has produced and trial-produced more than one hundred types of alloy steel in the first three and a half months of this year.

    This year, Shanghai not only wants to increase steel production from 1.22 million tons last year to more than 1.6 million tons, but also wants to produce a large number of high-grade alloy steels to meet the needs of Shanghai's electrical machinery industry and other fields. To this end, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Metallurgy requested Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 and other factories at the end of March to further increase the production of alloy steel in April and the second quarter. The leaders of the electric furnace workshop of Plant No. 5 held several meetings to study the possibility of increasing the output of alloy steel in April by four times compared to March, and explained the difficulties in production to the masses and launched discussions. The workers unanimously agreed that, based on past experience, the key to increasing alloy steel production lies in improving the operating rate and shortening the smelting time. Therefore, focusing on these two keys, a heated red flag competition was launched between workshops, furnaces, and groups. They learned from the experience of fraternal steel plants, installed cooling water tanks and serpentine cooling water pipes in the high-temperature parts of the electric furnace, and added other measures, extending the furnace life by more than doubled compared to the past, and shortening the overhaul time of Furnace No. 1 by half. This improved the operating rate. They also adopted the "precipitation deoxidation method" when smelting high-quality carbon structural steel, shortening the smelting time of each furnace by about 20 minutes.

    The difference between alloy steel and ordinary steel lies in the different elements they contain. Ordinary steel generally contains elements such as iron, carbon, manganese, and silicon; alloy steel, in addition to containing the above elements, also contains a certain amount of one or several other elements, such as aluminum, copper, nickel, chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, etc., or no other elements are added, but the content of silicon and manganese is increased. Due to the different elements contained, the properties of the steel are also different. Some alloy steels have high hardness, some have strong elasticity, some do not rust, and some have less current loss when conducting electricity. There are nearly a thousand kinds of alloy steel, and they are widely used in power generation equipment, precision instruments, high-grade machine tools, chemical equipment, metal cutting tools, etc., all of which require alloy steel.

    Before last year, Shanghai basically did not produce alloy steel. Currently, Shanghai has produced and trial-produced a total of more than one hundred types of alloy steel, including high-grade alloy steel for manufacturing steam turbine "blades" and generator "rotors," alloy steel for manufacturing watch springs, high-strength tool steel, and ball bearing steel, etc.

    大力发展铁合金工业
    冶金部决定逐步建立铁合金基地
    上海试制成功一百多种合金钢
    据新华社21日讯　冶金工业部最近召开了全国铁合金会议，决定大力发展铁合金生产，增产足够数量的矽铁、锰铁和各种特种铁合金，以适应今年钢铁工业大跃进的需要。
    会议指出，去年我国铁合金工业有了很大发展，除新建了若干大型铁合金电炉以外，各地还因地制宜地建设了大批小型简易铁合金电炉，从而基本上满足了去年钢产加番的需要。今年，随着钢产量增长到一千八百万吨，矽铁、锰铁以及少数特种铁合金的产量，都需要有很大增长。
    会议确定继续大力贯彻两条腿走路的方针，结合我国资源情况，发展铁合金工业。为此，会议除决定加快建设大型铁合金企业以外，还要求各省市建立独立的专门冶炼铁合金工厂，或在钢铁厂和有条件的机械厂建立铁合金车间，并且配合各地区的钢铁生产逐渐发展成为中小型的铁合金工业基地。同时，各地还应当抓紧铁合金原料基地的建设工作。
    会议指出，现有铁合金企业还有很大生产潜力可以挖掘。目前，很多铁合金电炉的产量没有达到设计指标，生产效率没有充分发挥出来。因此，会议号召职工积极改进技术，开展以提高电炉利用系数为中心的高产优质节电红旗竞赛，利用原有设备增产更多更好的铁合金。
    会议在交流了北京钢铁学院冶炼矽铁的高产节电经验，以及其他单位的生产和基建方面的先进经验以后，还具体规定出了中小型电炉利用系数和耗电量的指标。
    据新华社上海21日电　去年才开始大量生产合金钢的上海钢铁工业，在今年头三个半月内生产和试制成功了一百多种合金钢。
    今年，上海不仅要把钢产量从去年的一百二十二万吨提高到一百六十万吨以上，还要生产大量高级的合金钢，以适应上海电机工业和其他方面的需要。为此，上海市冶金局在3月底就要求上钢五厂等厂在4月份和第二季度中进一步增产合金钢。五厂电炉车间领导上召开了多次会议，研究了把4月份合金钢的产量比3月份提高四倍的可能性，并且向群众交代了生产中存在的困难，展开鸣放讨论。职工们一致认为，根据过去的经验，提高合金钢产量的关键在于提高作业率和缩短冶炼时间。于是，针对这两个关键，车间与车间、炉与炉、组与组之间展开了热烈的红旗竞赛。他们学习了兄弟钢厂的经验，在电炉高温部分装上冷却水箱和蛇形冷却水管，加上其他措施，电炉炉龄比过去延长了一倍多，一号电炉的中修时间也比过去缩短了一半。这样就提高了作业率。他们还在冶炼优质碳素结构钢时采用“沉淀脱氧法”，使每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短了二十分钟左右。
    合金钢与普通钢的区别，在于所含元素不同。普通钢一般含有铁、碳、锰、矽等元素；合金钢除开含有以上的元素以外，还有一定数量的一种或几种其他元素，如铝、铜、镍、铬、钨、钼等，或者不加其他元素，而增加矽、锰的含量。由于含有元素不同，钢的性能也不同，有的合金钢硬度高，有的弹性强，有的不生锈，有的导电时电流损失少。合金钢的种类有近千种，用途非常广，发电设备、精密仪表、高级机床、化工设备、金属切削刀具等，都需用合金钢。
    去年以前上海基本上不生产合金钢，目前，上海已经生产和试制成功合金钢共有一百多种，其中有制造汽轮机“叶片”和发电机“转子”的高级合金钢，有制造手表发条的合金钢、高强度工具钢、滚珠轴承钢等。
