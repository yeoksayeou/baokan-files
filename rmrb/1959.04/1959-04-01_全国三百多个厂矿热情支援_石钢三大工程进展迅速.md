More than 300 Factories and Mines Across the Country Enthusiastically Support
    Shijingshan Steel's Three Major Projects Progressing Rapidly
    (Our dispatch) The No. 3 blast furnace, No. 3 coke oven, and sintering plant—three major projects of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, which have entered the full installation phase—have received enthusiastic support from more than 300 factories and mines across the country. Currently, more than 80% of the total equipment has been transported to the construction site.
    Party committees in various regions attach great importance to supporting Shijingshan Steel's construction. The CPC Dalian Municipal Committee convened a special meeting to urge relevant enterprises in the city to make every effort to complete the equipment production for Shijingshan Steel ahead of schedule. The Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory, which is responsible for manufacturing the "four major vehicles" (coke stacking car, coke quenching car, coal charging car, and weighing car) for Shijingshan Steel's No. 3 coke oven, had its factory director and Party committee secretary going deep into the workshops, taking shifts day and night with the workers to fight hard in order to deliver the goods as early as possible. The Harbin Electric Machinery Factory is manufacturing a converter unit for Shijingshan Steel's No. 3 blast furnace. Under normal production conditions, it would take more than three months to complete this batch of equipment, but after the factory Party committee secretary took personal command and repeatedly mobilized the workers for discussion and research, a practical plan to complete it in 35 days has been arranged.
    In the process of manufacturing equipment for Shijingshan Steel, the workers of many units overcame many technical and production management difficulties with tenacious fighting spirit, and delivered the goods on time or ahead of schedule. The Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant had never produced the 1.4-meter windbreak valve for Shijingshan Steel before. After the workers' diligent research, they finally succeeded in manufacturing it and delivered it on schedule. The material cars, winches, and other equipment manufactured by the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant for Shijingshan Steel were all completed a quarter ahead of schedule.
    The relevant central departments also strongly support Shijingshan Steel's construction. The Ministry of Railways recently specially allocated four locomotives for Shijingshan Steel's use. The First Ministry of Machine Building, upon hearing that Shijingshan Steel was short of more than 2,000 bearings, which prevented many equipment from being assembled, immediately found more than 1,900 bearings from its warehouse to support Shijingshan Steel.
    Furthermore, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company has made arrangements for production and construction in the second quarter.
    The newly built No. 3 blast furnace, No. 3 coke oven, and sintering plant—three major projects—will be completed and put into production in the second quarter. At present, most of the equipment for the three major projects has been installed. The sintering plant has started single-unit trial runs, the No. 3 coke oven started baking the oven on March 23, and the hot blast stove of the No. 3 blast furnace is also about to start baking the oven. The expansion of auxiliary projects such as the limestone mine and the storage of raw materials such as ore are also being accelerated. Now, the company's employees are launching a high-production, high-quality, and high-efficiency competition, striving to overfulfill the production and construction tasks for the second quarter.

    全国三百多个厂矿热情支援
    石钢三大工程进展迅速
    本报讯　进入全面安装阶段的石景山钢铁公司三高炉、三焦炉、烧结厂三大工程，得到了全国各地三百多个厂矿的热情支援，现在，占总量80％以上的设备，已经运到了工地。
    各地党委都十分重视支援石钢的建设。中共大连市委召开了一次专门会议，督促全市有关企业，尽最大可能争取提前完成为石钢制作的设备。担负为石钢三焦炉制作“四大车”（堆焦车、拦焦车、装煤车和秤量车）任务的大连工矿车辆厂，为了尽早提前交货，厂长和党委书记都深入车间，昼夜轮流和工人们一起苦战。哈尔滨电机厂正在为石钢三高炉制造变流机组。按照正常的生产状况，这批设备需要三个多月才能完成，但是经过厂党委书记亲自挂帅，反复发动职工讨论研究，已经安排好了三十五天完成的切实计划。
    许多单位的职工在为石钢制造设备的过程中，以顽强的战斗精神，克服了很多技术和生产管理上遇到的困难，按期或提前交货。抚顺重型机械厂为石钢制造一公尺四的防风阀，过去没有生产过。经过职工们的刻苦钻研，终于制造成功，按期交了货。沈阳重型机器厂为石钢制作的料车、卷扬机等设备，都提前一个季度完成。
    中央有关部门也大力支援石钢的建设。铁道部最近专门调拨了四台机车，供石钢使用。第一机械工业部听说石钢因为缺两千多个轴承，许多设备无法配套，马上从仓库中找出一千九百多个轴承，支援石钢。
    又讯　石景山钢铁公司对第二季度的生产建设工作作了安排。
    新建的三高炉、三焦炉、烧结厂三大工程将在第二季度建成并投入生产。现在三大工程绝大部分设备都已安装完毕，烧结厂已开始单体试车，三焦炉在3月23日开始烘炉，三高炉的热风炉也即将开始烘炉。石灰石矿等附属工程的扩建和矿石等原材料的储备工作也着手加速进行。现在，这个公司的职工正掀起一个高产高质高效率的竞赛高潮，力争超额完成第二季度生产建设任务。（附图片）
