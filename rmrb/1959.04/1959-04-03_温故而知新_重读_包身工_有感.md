    Reviewing the Old to Know the New
    ——Thoughts on Rereading "A Pieceworker"
    Wang Huo

    In the fifth and sixth issues of "Chinese Workers," the full text of Comrade Xia Yan's reportage "A Pieceworker," written in 1935, was reprinted. Also published were Comrade Xia Yan's "Memories Triggered by 'A Pieceworker'," as well as testimonies from old workers who had been pieceworkers and post-reading reflections from new workers. The editor's note stated: "Knowing the suffering of workers before liberation will make us feel the happiness of the working people's lives today even more, and will further encourage us to work harder to build socialism. Our purpose in reprinting Comrade Xia Yan's reportage 'A Pieceworker' here is to provide a learning material for the broad masses of new workers..." I think this approach by "Chinese Workers" is good. There's an old saying, "Reviewing the old to know the new." Today's young people, living in happiness, may know very little about that tragic era that has passed. Therefore, looking back to learn about some of the past events will undoubtedly be of great benefit.
      "A Pieceworker," this excellent piece of reportage, in just over ten thousand words, depicts the tragic life of "pieceworkers" in a hell on earth. A "pieceworker" is a female textile worker whose body is "packaged" to the foreman in a peculiar way. The foremen go to the countryside, use deceptive methods to pay a little money to "package" them, and bring them to Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai to work. Thus, they become true slaves, their bodies and everything they own are possessed by the foremen. They suffer from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudal forces, and capitalists. They eat pig swill, sixteen or seventeen people are crammed into a room seven feet wide and twelve feet deep, and they work under the worst labor conditions. Beatings, starvation, being hung up, being locked in dark rooms... No matter how sick they are, they still have to sell their lives to the foremen and capitalists, working under the lash of sticks. "A Pieceworker" is a powerful indictment of the evils of the old society—although it only reveals a corner of the dark scenes of the old society. But anyone who reads it once will increase their hatred for the old society countless times and increase their love for our bright and beautiful new society countless times. Anyone who is still "unaware of the blessings in the midst of happiness" will inevitably blush with shame.
    The facts introduced by Comrade Xia Yan in "A Pieceworker" are very exciting, and many scenes leave people with a deep impression that they cannot forget. These horrific and bloody facts are the most powerful evidence for indicting exploitation and the old China. The author uses sympathetic and indignant strokes to relentlessly鞭挞 [whip, lash] the old society and the evil forces, which further enhances the appeal of this excellent piece of reportage.
    The author said: "Among these tens of thousands of creatures being fed, there is no light, no warmth, no affection, no hope... no law, no humanity... The night is as silent as death, but the arrival of dawn is finally irresistible..." Yes, the author's prediction has come true. The era when workers were treated as beasts of burden and insects by capitalists has gone forever. How much life, blood, sweat, and tears did our ancestors pay to overthrow that cannibalistic social system!
    Recollection and comparison are one of the best methods for conducting political and ideological education for new workers. Beijing State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3 is organizing all new workers to read and study "A Pieceworker," and some old workers are also participating, which is said to be very effective. For example, the old worker Liu Xiumei said: "After liberation, the working conditions in the weaving workshop have become better and better. When we said the workshop was too hot, the factory immediately installed exhaust fans. In June, the workshop was cooler than the outside!... A long passage was also built outside the workshop. After leaving the workshop, we first go to the passage with a relatively low temperature, and then go outside, so it is not easy to catch a cold. With the development of production, the working conditions will be even better. This shows that the Party and the government are always concerned about us workers. In order to build socialism, we should work harder and more diligently." The workers used their personal experiences to speak the truth, and felt the happiness of being a worker in the Mao Zedong era. I think that although "A Pieceworker" is about the affairs of textile workers, it has universal educational significance. It is a very good thing to introduce new workers to read this exciting piece of reportage and help them further improve their ideological awareness.

    温故而知新
    ——重读“包身工”有感
    王火
    “中国工人”第五期及第六期上，重登了夏衍同志在1935年写的报告文学“包身工”的全文，并且还发表了夏衍同志写的“从‘包身工’引起的回忆”，以及做过包身工的老工人的自述及新工人的读后感。编者在按语中说：“知道解放前工人生活的痛苦，就更会感觉到今天劳动人民生活的幸福，也就会更加鼓足干劲建设社会主义。我们在此重新发表夏衍同志的报告文学作品——‘包身工’，目的就是向广大的新工人提供一份学习材料。……”我觉得，“中国工人”的这种做法是好的。有句老话叫做“温故而知新”，今天的年轻人，身在福中，对已经过去了的那个悲惨时代，知道得可能是很少的。那么，回头来知道一些过去的事情，无疑会有很大好处。
      “包身工”这篇优秀的报告文学，仅仅不过万把字的篇幅，却刻划出了“包身工”所过的那种人间地狱的悲惨生活。“包身工”——这是一种把身体以一种奇妙的方式包给了工头的纺织女工。工头们到乡下去，用欺骗方式付一点钱，把她们“包”下来，带到上海的日本纱厂里做工，于是她们就成了真正的奴隶，她们的身体，她们的一切都为工头所占有。她们身受着帝国主义、封建势力、资本家的压迫剥削。吃的是猪食，七尺阔、十二尺深的一间房里要挤着住上十六七个人，在最坏的劳动条件下工作。殴打、饿饭、吊起、关黑房间……无论病到什么程度，仍得要向工头和资本家卖命，在棍棒下去工作。“包身工”是一篇对旧社会的罪恶的有力的控诉书——虽然它所揭示的还仅不过是旧社会黑暗场面中的一角。但谁只要读上一遍，就会对旧社会增加无数仇恨，对我们今天这光明、美好的新社会增加无数热爱。谁如果再“身在福中不知福”，那就必然会脸红的。
    夏衍同志在“包身工”中所介绍的事实是十分激动人心的，许多场面都使人看后能得到深刻的印象，忘怀不了。这些惨绝人寰的血泪事实是最有力的控诉剥削、控诉旧中国的证据。作者用同情、愤激的笔触，对旧社会、对恶势力进行了无情的鞭挞，这就更加增强这篇优秀报告文学作品的感染力。
    作者说：“在这千万被饲养者的中间，没有光，没有热，没有温情，没有希望……没有法律，没有人道。……黑夜，静寂得像死一般的黑夜，但是，黎明的到来，还是终于无法可以抗拒的。……”是的，作者的预言是实现了，工人给资本家当牛马、当虫豸的时代，已经一去不复返了。为了推翻那个人吃人的社会制度，我们的先人曾付出了多少生命、血汗和眼泪啊！
    回忆对比，是向新工人进行政治思想教育最好的方法之一。北京国棉三厂正在组织全体新工人阅读学习“包身工”，有些老工人也参加了，据说效果很好。例如老工人刘秀梅说：“解放后，织布车间的劳动条件越来越好。我们说车间太热，厂里立刻给安上抽风机。6月间，车间里比外面还凉快哩！……车间外面还造了一条长长的过道。出了车间，先到温度比较低的过道，再到外面，就不容易感冒了。随着生产的发展，劳动条件就会更好。这说明党和政府随时都关心着我们工人。为了建设社会主义，我们应该更加鼓足干劲，勤勤恳恳地工作。”工人们用切身的体会，说出了真理，感到作为一个毛泽东时代的工人的幸福。我想，“包身工”写的虽是纺织工人的事，但有普遍教育意义，介绍新工人读读这篇激动人心的报告文学作品，帮助他们进一步提高思想觉悟，是一件很好的事。
