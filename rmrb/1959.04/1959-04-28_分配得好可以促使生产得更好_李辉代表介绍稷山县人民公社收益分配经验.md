Comrades,

I fully endorse all the reports presented at this conference. These reports summarize the heroic deeds of 650 million people in building socialism, showcase the beautiful and promising future of our motherland, and sound the clarion call for a greater leap forward in 1959. The people of the whole country will surely unite more closely, exert greater efforts, and march forward with vigorous strides to continue launching a greater leap forward. This is indeed the case. Recently, during my inspection in Jishan County, Shanxi Province, I personally witnessed this vivid scene. People, each and every one of them, are cheerful and full of energy. The land is as flat as a mirror, and the wheat seedlings are growing luxuriantly in every field. My excitement is beyond words. This prosperous situation is, of course, due to the establishment of the People's Commune. However, in the work of the People's Commune, Jishan County has done a relatively good job in profit distribution, which is also an important reason. Therefore, I would like to say a few words on this issue.

Some people say: Production determines distribution; production is the primary thing. Only when there is something can it be distributed. The implication seems to be that distribution work is insignificant. Yes, production is primary and determines distribution. This should be affirmed first. However, these people do not know that distribution work also has an important impact on production. That is to say, if done well, it can promote the development of production; if done poorly, it will become an obstacle to the development of production. Therefore, the relationship between production and distribution must be understood dialectically. Both production and distribution must be grasped. It is under this correct ideological guidance that the leadership of Jishan County has done a good job in distribution work. Their method is summarized in these six sentences:

	The state, the collective, and the individual all say it’s good
	Long-term and immediate interests are both taken care of
	Distribution according to labor, more labor should mean more gain
	The ratio of wages to the supply system must be well-considered
	Material goods plus cash suit the needs
	Accounts must be settled quickly and distribution must be early

These six methods are like six ropes, all of which must be grasped together. None can be too tight, and none can be too loose. This is truly a concrete and meticulous task. The leadership must be like a "housekeeper," distributing fairly and reasonably. How does the leadership of Jishan County act as this "housekeeper"?

First, let's look at the first point: Based on the total agricultural and sideline income of 74.87 million yuan in 1958, they made correct regulations on the distribution ratio between the state, the collective, and the individual. Among them, state tax accounted for 9.3 percent, production expenses accounted for 21 percent, public accumulation accounted for 7.6 percent, and the personal consumption of commune members accounted for 61.9 percent. Ninety-two percent of the commune members in the county increased their income compared to 1957, with an average increase of 28.1 percent per person. In terms of grain, even in the bumper harvest year of 1956, only 3 million catties of grain procurement tasks were completed. In 1957, due to disaster and reduced production, the state even supplied 2 million catties. What about 1958? 21.4 million catties were handed over to the state, over fulfilling the grain procurement task assigned by the state. And the commune members? They received an average of 435 catties per person, with some receiving more than 500 catties. The county also controlled more than 2 million catties of mobile grain reserves. The result of this distribution truly satisfied the state, the collective, and the individual.

Second, in order to take both long-term and immediate interests into account, they adhered to the principle of "acting according to one's ability and running the commune diligently and thriftily" in production investment and the construction of major infrastructure projects. They considered both the long-term interests that must be addressed and the appropriate increase in the personal income and living needs of commune members in the current year. Therefore, their water conservancy and other construction projects all involved low investment and high benefits, which satisfied the masses. For example, the Fan Village People's Commune initially planned to build a five-stage pumping irrigation project to divert water from the Yellow River, and later proposed building a large reservoir. After calculation, it was found that not only would the investment be too large, but the required materials could not be obtained. The county party committee did not approve it and instead asked them to dig springs and intercept subsurface flow. Intercepting subsurface flow is truly a method that is fast, efficient, good, and economical. It expanded the irrigated land by 40,000 mu, with an average investment of only 1.4 fen per mu. The masses praised, "Forty thousand mu of dry land turned into rice paddies, costing only a few hundred yuan. We should do more of this kind of thing!" Because they took into account both the long-term interests of the masses and their immediate needs, and properly handled the relationship between long-term and immediate interests, they won the support of the broad masses.

Third, in the distribution to commune members, they adhered to the socialist distribution principle of "distribution according to labor," adopted the method of "determining work points based on output and evaluating work and recording points," which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of commune members for labor. Those commune members who worked more and harvested more received the rewards they deserved. For example, Du Xin-suo's family in the Liwang People's Commune received 540 yuan in cash alone, and their enthusiasm for labor has grown even greater. In the matter of distribution, they fought against all kinds of egalitarian ideas and also criticized the fantasy of "distribution according to need," which is not suitable for the current state of development of productive forces.

Fourth, on the premise of adhering to the principle of "distribution according to labor," they implemented a specific distribution method that combines the supply system and the wage system. Due to the different income situations of each commune, the ratio between the two also varied. Under the current conditions, the wage part should be the main one. In some communes, the wage part accounts for 85 percent of the commune members' income, with the lowest being 52 percent, and the average being over 60 percent. On this issue, they criticized the idea of blindly expanding the supply system part, because it would affect the increase in income for the vast majority of commune members. They also criticized the idea of simply abolishing the supply system part, because the supply system part can guarantee the livelihood of all commune members, and it is the beginning of communist distribution.

Fifth, when distributing, in addition to rations and other materials, they tried their best to issue cash for the wage part, which was warmly supported by the commune members. Commune members find it convenient to spend the cash they receive, and everyone praises it. In the Liwang People's Commune, 343 commune members built or renovated more than 800 houses. Bank deposits are also increasing. According to statistics from the Ronghe People's Commune's bank branch, commune members' deposits in the summer of last year were 250,000 yuan, and in February of this year, they suddenly increased to 437,000 yuan. As production develops, people's demands for a happy life become more urgent. However, individuals have different characteristics and preferences. Under the principle of the large collective, people naturally welcome being able to receive cash and arrange their own lives.

Sixth, accounts should be settled quickly and distribution should be done early, opposing procrastination. In November last year, as soon as the autumn harvest was completed, they organized more than 1,100 cadres to go to the communes to help with accounting and distribution. As a result, each commune quickly made its final accounts and distribution plan, and quickly completed the distribution work. In the past, it was common to organize a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to help with production, but it was rare to see them help with accounting and distribution. This proves that the leaders of Jishan County have a clear mass viewpoint and fully understand the urgent desire of commune members for distribution after a year of hard work. It seems that in distribution work, while reasonable distribution is important, timely distribution should not be neglected.

The distribution work in Jishan County is done relatively well because it conforms to the Party's line, principles, and policies, from principles and policies to methods. Therefore, commune members are all in good spirits, full of enthusiasm, and how can their energy not be great? Their valuable experience provides us with great inspiration and profound lessons. We cannot neglect either grasping production or grasping distribution. The two are interconnected and mutually causal. This is the principle that handling the relations of production well will promote the development of productive forces!

Comrades, the plan has been set, and the clarion call has been sounded. Let us, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, unite the people of the whole country and strive with full confidence to fulfill and overfulfill this year's national economic plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton! Strive to fulfill and overfulfill all other tasks! Victory must be ours!

Finally, I wholeheartedly endorse all the reports of the representatives on the Tibet issue. We denounce the crimes of the Tibetan reactionary rebel group in undermining national unification and ethnic unity, oppose the interference in our country's internal affairs by British imperialism and Indian expansionist elements, and oppose the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama." We warmly celebrate the new life of the Tibetan people and pay our highest respects to the People's Liberation Army for swiftly quelling the armed rebellion in Tibet!

### 分配得好可以促使生产得更好  李辉代表介绍稷山县人民公社收益分配经验

专栏：

    分配得好可以促使生产得更好
    李辉代表介绍稷山县人民公社收益分配经验主席，各位代表：
    我完全拥护大会的各项报告。这些报告总结了六亿五千万人民建设社会主义的英雄事迹，展示了祖国美好的锦绣前程，吹起了一九五九年更大跃进的号角。全国人民必将更加团结一致，鼓足干劲，迈开矫健的步伐，继续掀起更大跃进。事实正是这样，最近我在山西省稷山县视察工作，就亲眼看到了这种生动的景象。看人，个个心情舒畅，干劲十足；看地，块块平坦如镜，亩亩麦苗茁壮。兴奋之情难以言喻。这种欣欣向荣的局面，当然是由于人民公社的建立而出现的。但在人民公社的工作中，稷山县对收益分配工作做得比较好，也是个重要原因，因此，我想就这个问题讲几句话。
    有些人说：生产决定分配，生产是主要的，有了东西才能分配。言外之音，似乎觉得分配工作是无足轻重的事。是的，生产是主要的，决定分配的，这应当首先肯定，但这些人却不知道分配工作对生产也有重要的影响作用。就是说做好了可以推动生产的发展，做不好就会变为阻碍生产发展的力量。所以，对于生产与分配的关系，必须辩证的理解，既抓生产，也抓分配。稷山县的领导上正是在这种正确的思想指导下做好了分配工作的。他们的办法就是六句话：
    国家集体个人三说好
    长远暂时利益同顾到
    按劳分配多劳应多得
    工资供给比例要周到
    物资加现金适合需要
    结帐要快分得还要早
    六个办法像六条绳子，必须一把抓起来，那条也紧不得，那条也松不得。这真是一项具体细致的工作，领导上必须像“管家婆”一样，分配得公道合理。稷山县领导上是怎样当好这个“管家婆”呢？
    先看第一条：他们根据一九五八年七千四百八十七万元的农副业总收入，对国家、集体和个人间的分配比例，做了正确的规定。其中国家税收占百分之九点三，生产费用占百分之二十一，公共积累占百分之七点六，社员个人消费占百分之六十一点九。全县百分之九十二的社员比一九五七年增加了收入，每人平均增加收入百分之二十八点一。在粮食方面，大丰收的一九五六年，也只完成征购任务三百万斤，一九五七年因灾减产还由国家供应了二百万斤，一九五八年呢？上交给国家二千一百四十万斤，超额完成了国家分配的征购任务。社员呢？每人平均分配四百三十五斤，多者五百斤以上。县里还掌握着二百多万斤机动粮。这样分配的结果，真正做到了国家、集体和个人三满意，三说好。
    第二条，他们为了做到长远利益与暂时利益同时兼顾，在生产投资和举办大的基本建设上，坚持“量力而行，勤俭办社”的原则。既顾到长远利益不能不办，也顾到当年社员个人收入的适当增加和生活的需要。因此，他们的水利和其他方面的建设，均是花钱少，受益大，群众满意。例如樊村人民公社先计划五级抽水引黄灌溉，后又拟建大水库，经计算不仅投资过大，而且所需材料也无法取得，县委没有批准，让他们挖泉截潜流。截潜流真是个多快好省的办法，扩大了四万亩水地，每亩平均只投资一分四厘钱。群众称赞的说：“四万亩旱地变水田，花钱不过几百元，这样事情要多办啊！”因为他们既注意到群众的长远利益，也照顾到群众的暂时需要，适当的处理了长远利益与暂时利益的关系，得到广大群众的拥护。
    第三条，在对社员分配上，他们坚持了“按劳分配”的社会主义分配原则，采用了“以产定工和评工记分”的办法，大大激发了社员的劳动热情。那些多劳和收获大的社员，均得到了应得的报酬。像里望人民公社社员杜心锁一户，只现款就分到了五百四十元，劳动积极性越来越大了。在分配问题上，他们曾与各色各样的平均主义思想进行了斗争，也批判了不适合当前生产力发展状况的“按需分配”的空想。
    第四条，在坚持“按劳分配”原则的前提下，实现了供给制与工资制相结合的具体的分配办法。由于各公社收入情况的不同，二者的比例也有所不同，在当前条件下，应以工资部分为主。有的社工资部分占到社员收入的百分之八十五，最低百分之五十二，平均在百分之六十以上。在这个问题上，他们批判了一味扩大供给制部分的思想，因为他会影响绝大部分社员增加收入；也批判了干脆取消供给制部分的思想，因为供给制部分可使全体社员在生活上得到保证，它是共产主义分配的萌芽。
    第五条，他们在分配时，除过口粮和其他一些物质外，工资部分，想尽各种办法，发给现金，得到了社员们的热烈拥护。社员们得到现金，花用方便，人人称好。里望人民公社有三百四十三个社员新建或修建了八百余间房子。银行存款也在增加。荣河人民公社银行营业所统计，在去年夏季社员存款为二十五万元，今年二月份就突增为四十三万七千元。生产越发展，人民对于幸福生活的要求也就越迫切了。但个人的特点、喜爱各有不同，在大集体的原则下，人们当然欢迎能领到现金，自己安排自己的生活。
    第六条，就是要快结帐早分配，反对拖拖拉拉。在去年十一月秋收刚完时，他们就组织了一千一百余个干部，分赴各公社帮助结帐，进行分配。于是各公社很快做出了决算和分配方案，迅速完成了分配工作。在过去组织大批干部下乡帮助生产是常见的事，但帮助结帐、分配的事却不多见。这证明稷山县的领导上有明确的群众观点，十分懂得社员在辛勤劳动一年之后，要求分配的迫切心情。看来，在分配工作上，分配的合理固然重要，分配的及时也决不可忽视。
    稷山县的分配工作，由于从原则、政策直到办法上，都符合党的路线方针和政策，都做得比较好，所以社员个个心情舒畅，意志奋发，干劲怎能不大呢？他们的这一宝贵经验，对我们启示很大，教益极深。抓生产与抓分配二者不可偏废，二者相互联系互为因果，这也就是处理好生产关系，才会推动生产力发展的原理吧！
    各位代表，计划定了，号角响了，让我们在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，团结全国人民，满怀信心地为完成和超额完成今年以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的国民经济计划而奋斗！为完成和超额完成其它各项任务而奋斗！胜利一定是我们的！
    最后，我衷心的拥护各位代表关于西藏问题的各个报告，我们痛斥西藏反动叛乱集团破坏祖国统一和民族团结的罪行，反对英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国的内政，反对所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，我们热烈的庆贺西藏人民的新生，并向迅速荡平西藏武装叛乱的人民解放军致以崇高的敬意！
