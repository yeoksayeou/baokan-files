　　Not only write, but also recite
　　Ge Chaohai
    In Soviet writer V. Pertsov's article introducing Mayakovsky, there is this record: "He recited his poems in clubs, schools, Red Army barracks, and factory workshops filled with audiences. On average, more than 60,000 people listened to his recitations each year. He received nearly 20,000 slips of paper with questions when he recited poetry."
    Look, what an amazing number! Just talking about the audience, more than 60,000 people a year, that's more than 5,000 people a month. Assuming each recitation meeting has 500 people (which is already a not-small recitation meeting), then there are ten times a month, averaging once every three days. This is equivalent to saying that the poet has to participate in a mass meeting every three days, directly using the "language of poetry" to carry out socialist propaganda and mobilization work. Although this mechanical averaging method is unreasonable (in fact, it is not once every three days, but often once or several times a day), it is enough to illustrate the "poet's loud power."
    Mayakovsky called this tense recitation activity his "second job," and he believed that this was inheriting the tradition of Russian "wandering poets."
    Although our country does not have this tradition of "wandering poets," some poets also pay great attention to the combination of their poems and the masses. Like Bai Juyi, it is said that "every time he wrote a poem, he would have an old woman understand it. He would ask if she understood it, and if she did, he would record it; if she didn't understand, he would revise it again." In today's terms, it should also be said to be a form of recitation, with the poet's poems being tested by the masses on the spot. As Mayakovsky said: "To test whether one's own works are easy to understand, what is desirable, and what is undesirable."
    As for folk songs, it is no exception. From ancient times to the present, most folk songs have been passed down orally through recitation, singing, and responding; in essence, folk songs are propaganda and mobilization poems created and recited by the masses. Especially today, when the new folk song movement is booming throughout the country, poetry recitation is even more universal, and the forms of recitation are also more diversified. Poetry can not only be chanted and recited, but also sung, competed in, and exhibited; it is no longer self-recitation and self-appreciation, but universal singing, with songs shaking the sky. In the past year or so, how many great leap forward poems have our millions of singers across the country sung! How many poetry contests and recitation meetings have been held in cities, villages, factories, and fields!
    Now, let's look at our professional poets. In the past year, there has indeed been a great leap forward in poetry creation, and many new and good poems have been published. Some poets have sung and responded with the masses, and they have also achieved certain results in going deep into the masses and learning from folk songs. This is a gratifying phenomenon. But unfortunately, this phenomenon is not frequent enough or universal enough. Therefore, I think, if more poets can inherit the tradition of "wandering poets," like Bai Juyi and Mayakovsky, like the millions of folk singers today, not only write poems at their desks, but also go to the masses to recite poems, to enthusiastically use the "language of poetry" to carry out socialist propaganda and mobilization, and bravely test their works in front of the masses, how good would that be!
    It is very clear that in this great leap forward upsurge, in the booming new folk song movement that is opening up a new era of poetry, it is even more realistic for poets to more actively, directly, and frequently recite their poems to the masses, and further integrate with the masses. In this way, poets will not only better serve politics and the great leap forward of socialist construction; but also more effectively learn from folk songs, so as to be able to solve the road problem of new poetry development more quickly in practice.
    To use fiery poetic lines to inspire the fighting spirit of our 600 million people and to carry out propaganda and mobilization work to accelerate socialist construction is the most sublime and glorious mission of contemporary poets. To successfully complete this mission, we must not only use words, but also language; not only write poems ourselves, but also recite poems for the masses. This can also be regarded as walking on two legs!

### 不仅能写，还要能诵

　　不仅能写，还要能诵
　　葛超海
    苏联文学家弗·彼尔卓夫介绍马雅可夫斯基的文章里，有这样一段记载：“他在坐满听众的俱乐部大厅、学校、红军兵营和工厂车间朗诵自己的诗篇。平均每年有六万多人听他的朗诵。他在朗诵诗时曾收到差不多两万张提问题的小条。”
    看，这是多么惊人的数字啊！单说听众吧，每年六万多人，每月就有五千多人。假设每次朗诵会以五百人（这已经是一个不算小的朗诵会了）计算，那么每月就有十次，平均每三天一次。这等于说，诗人每三天就要参加一次群众大会，直接用“诗的语言”进行社会主义的宣传鼓动工作。这种机械的平均计算方法虽不合理（事实上不是三天一次，而经常是每天一次或数次），但也足够说明那“诗人的响亮的力量”了。
    马雅可夫斯基把这种紧张的朗诵活动称为自己的“第二件工作”，他认为这是继承俄罗斯“行吟诗人们的传统”。
    我国虽然没有这种“行吟诗人”的传统，但是，有些诗人也非常注意自己的诗和群众的结合。像白居易，据说，他“每作诗，令老妪解之。问曰解否，曰解则录之；不解，则又复易之。”照现在的说法，应该说也是种朗诵的形式，诗人的诗当场接受群众的检验。正如马雅可夫斯基说的：“要检验一下自己的作品是不是好懂，什么是要得的，什么是要不得的。”
    至于民歌，更不例外。从古到今，绝大部分民歌都是通过朗诵、唱和而口口相传的；实质上民歌就是群众创作并朗诵的宣传鼓动诗。特别是当新民歌运动在全国范围内蓬勃发展的今天，诗朗诵就更带有普遍性，朗诵的形式也更加多样化了。诗，不仅可吟咏、朗诵，而且可以演唱、比赛、展览；不再是自吟自赏、一唱三叹，而是普遍欢唱、歌声震天。近一年多来，我们全国千百万歌手们唱出了多少大跃进的诗篇啊！在城市、农村、工厂、田野，举行过多少次赛诗会和朗诵会啊！
    现在，再看看我们的专业诗人们。近一年来，诗歌创作确实有很大跃进，发表了不少新的好的诗篇，有些诗人同群众一起唱和，他们在深入群众、向民歌学习方面也获得了一定成绩。这是可喜的现象。但可惜这现象还不够经常，不够普遍。因此我想，如果能有更多的诗人继承“行吟诗人”的传统，像白居易、马雅可夫斯基那样，像当今千百万民间歌手们那样，不光是俯在案头写诗，而且还要到群众中去诵诗、去热情地用“诗的语言”进行社会主义的宣传和鼓动，勇敢地在群众面前检验自己的作品，那该有多好啊！
    很明显，在这大跃进高潮中，在新民歌运动正蓬勃发展而开一代诗风的今天，诗人们如果能更主动地、直接地、经常地为群众朗诵自己的诗篇，进一步同群众结合，就更有其现实意义。这样，诗人们不但会更好地为政治服务，为社会主义建设的大跃进服务；同时也会更有效地向民歌学习，从而能更快地在实践中解决新诗歌发展的道路问题。
    用火一般的诗句来鼓舞我们六亿人民的斗志，为加快社会主义建设而展开宣传鼓动工作，是当代诗人们最崇高、最光荣的使命。要想出色地完成这个使命，就不仅要用文字，还要用语言；不仅要自己写诗，还要为群众诵诗。这也算得是两条腿走路吧！
