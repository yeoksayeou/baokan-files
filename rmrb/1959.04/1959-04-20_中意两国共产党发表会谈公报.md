Xinhua News Agency, April 19th - Communiqué of the Talks between the Chinese Communist Party and the Italian Communist Party. The full text is as follows: At the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the delegation of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, headed by Comrade Gian Carlo Pajetta, Secretary of the Secretariat and member of the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, came to the People's Republic of China for study and visits on April 6, 1959. The members of the delegation were Antonio Rossi, member of the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, Celso Ghini, member of the Central Committee, Luciano Barca, member of the Central Committee, Maria Micetti, member of the Central Supervisory Committee, Gherardo Chiaromonte, and Giuseppe Boffa. The delegation visited factories, people's communes, schools, and other socio-cultural institutions in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Anshan, and other cities and several rural areas. During the visit, the delegation met and talked with workers, peasants, intellectuals, students, trade union workers, and responsible party workers.

Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with the delegation of the Italian Communist Party and held cordial talks.

In order to consolidate and develop the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Italian Communist Parties and the Chinese and Italian peoples, delegations from the Chinese Communist Party and the Italian Communist Party held sincere talks and exchanged views.

The Chinese Communist Party was represented in the talks by: Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, Wang Jiaxiang, Yang Shangkun, and Liu Ningyi.

The Italian Communist Party was represented in the talks by: Gian Carlo Pajetta, Antonio Rossi, Celso Ghini, Luciano Barca, Maria Micetti, Gherardo Chiaromonte, and Giuseppe Boffa.

The talks were conducted in a fraternal and friendly atmosphere.

This meeting helped the Italian comrades better understand the achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction and the work experience of the Chinese Communist Party. At the same time, it helped the Chinese comrades better understand the problems faced by the Italian workers' movement and the work and struggle experience of the Italian Communist Party. The two sides also discussed the current international situation and issues related to the international communist movement and reached a consensus.

The delegation of the Italian Communist Party expressed its admiration for the struggle and achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in building socialism. The soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and close ties with the masses of the Chinese Communist Party and its cadres left a deep impression on the delegation of the Italian Communist Party. By leading cadres to live and work with the people, giving play to the creative spirit of the laborers, raising the political consciousness of the working masses, absorbing workers and peasants into the management of economic undertakings, and relying on their supervision of the work of the Party and the State, the Chinese Communist Party has established increasingly close and lasting ties with the masses. The Chinese people are making great efforts, tapping all potentials, and mobilizing all forces to realize socialist industrialization at high speed. The Italian comrades saw how the Chinese people are striving to achieve this great goal on an extremely broad front, including the construction of the most modern large-scale joint ventures, and the use of all simple methods. On top of land reform and agricultural collectivization, the Chinese people are further developing the rural economy and carrying out socialist construction in the countryside through the great people's commune movement throughout the countryside with the active participation of the broad masses of peasants. China's people's communes combine agriculture, industry, and other aspects of social life, implement the integration of government and commune, and implement unified leadership and hierarchical management within the people's communes. In order to unite the broadest social forces to participate in socialist construction, the Chinese Communist Party is continuing to play the active role of the united front led by the working class with remarkable results. All of this convincingly shows that after a necessary historical period, China will be transformed from an economically and culturally backward country into an advanced socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

The delegation of the Chinese Communist Party expressed its deep sympathy and admiration for the struggle of the Italian working class and democratic progressive forces for peace, democracy, and social progress, and for the decisive role played by the Italian Communist Party in this struggle. The Italian Communist Party has broad and close ties with the Italian working class and the entire people. The Italian Communist Party is waging a remarkable struggle to defend peace and fully safeguard the national interests of Italy, to safeguard the daily interests of the Italian working masses, to defend democracy and carry out reforms in the economic and social structure, to unite the working masses and democratic forces, and to lead Italy towards socialism in accordance with its national characteristics. This struggle of the Communist Party, the working class, and the democratic progressive forces of the Italian people is an important part of the great progressive and liberation movement carried out by progressive forces all over the world, and has made and will continue to make significant contributions to the cause of defending world peace and striving for human progress.

The two parties unanimously affirmed that the balance of power in the current international situation, on the whole, is favorable to the cause of world peace, national independence, and democratic progress of the peoples of all countries. The strength of the socialist camp, the strength of the national independence movement, and the forces of world peace and progress have already gained an advantage over the imperialist forces. Their victory is the inevitable result of historical development. The prosperity of the socialist camp, the vigorous development of national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the unremitting struggle of the people of capitalist countries for democracy, freedom, and social progress are making the crisis of imperialism irredeemably serious and strengthening the confidence of all progressive humanity in the victory of their cause. However, in order to cope with their incurable and general crisis, the imperialists are still attempting to intensify international tensions, conduct the Cold War, and ignite provocations in the world. Therefore, uniting all peaceful, democratic, and progressive forces to defend world peace and ease international tensions is one of the basic tasks of the Communist and Workers' Parties. At present, the particularly urgent issues are to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the implementation of gradual and concerted disarmament, opposition to the establishment of military bases by the United States in foreign countries, opposition to colonialism and colonial wars, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the resolution of the Berlin issue, the establishment of collective security systems and nuclear-free zones in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, the resolution of international disputes by peaceful means, and the realization of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

The delegations of the two parties emphasized that the Soviet Union has played a decisive role in the cause of world peace and the easing of international tensions. The Chinese and Italian parties unanimously agree with and support the series of peace initiatives recently proposed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government.

The delegations of the two parties are convinced that the establishment of normal relations between the People's Republic of China and the Italian Republic is not only in the interests of the two peoples, but also a positive factor in easing international tensions, expanding peaceful relations between countries of the world, and promoting cultural and trade exchanges between countries. The delegation of the Italian Communist Party believes that all the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the international arena must be fully recognized.

The delegations of the two parties emphasized that the main conditions for winning the struggle for peace and socialism are the unity of the working class, the unity of the socialist camp, and the unity of the international communist movement. This unity is based on Marxism-Leninism and is the core of the unity of all peaceful, democratic, and progressive forces. The Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties held in November 1957 and its Declaration made great contributions to the consolidation and development of this unity. The recently held 21st Congress of the CPSU, marking the entry of the world's first socialist country into a new stage of comprehensively building a communist society, will inevitably play a positive role for the development of the socialist camp and the international communist movement.

The delegations of the two parties believe that a Communist Party loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism must unswervingly defend the unity of the international communist movement, defend the principles of the Declaration of the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties, and, in connection with its own country's traditions and realities, oppose revisionism and dogmatism. The delegations of the two parties declared that an uncompromising struggle must be waged against the main danger in the international communist movement—revisionism. Revisionism is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology and will lead the working class to surrender to the bourgeoisie and succumb to imperialism. The delegations of the two parties also declared that dogmatism must be resolutely opposed. Dogmatism will lead the Party to become divorced from the masses and become an obstacle to the accomplishment of revolutionary tasks. Both sides are deeply convinced that the masses of the people have a great initiative and an infinite creative power, that Marxism-Leninism can correctly express this spirit and power, and can become a guide for this spirit and power under any circumstances. This is the root of why the Communist Party can become the vanguard of the working class.

The delegations of the two parties are convinced that the visit of the delegation of the Italian Communist Party to China and the talks between the Chinese and Italian parties will help to develop the unity between the two parties and help to develop the friendly relations and economic and cultural ties between the Chinese and Italian peoples. The Chinese and Italian peoples must work together with the peoples of the world to strive to defend world peace and develop the cause of human culture and progress.

The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party invited the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to send a delegation to visit Italy at an appropriate time. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party gladly accepted this invitation. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    会谈是在兄弟般的友好的气氛中进行的。
    这次会谈，有助于意大利同志们更好地认识中国人民的社会主义建设成就和中国共产党的工作经验，同时有助于中国同志们更充分地了解意大利工人运动所面临的问题和意大利共产党的工作和斗争经验。双方又就目前国际形势和国际共产主义运动有关的问题，进行了商谈，并取得了一致的意见。
    意大利共产党代表团对于中国人民在中国共产党领导下为建设社会主义而进行的斗争和取得的成就，表示钦佩。中国共产党和它的干部的高涨的革命热情，密切联系群众的工作作风，给予了意大利共产党代表团以深刻的印象。中国共产党通过领导干部同人民一起生活和劳动，发挥劳动者的创造精神，提高劳动群众的政治觉悟，吸收工农群众参加经 济事业的管理，依靠他们对党和国家工作的监督，使中国共产党同人民群众建立了日益紧密的和持久的联系。中国人民进行着巨大的努力，挖掘一切潜力，调动一切力量，以高速度来实现社会主义工业化。意大利同志们看到，中国人民如何在极其广泛的战线上，包括建设最现代化的大规模的联合企业，以至利用一切简易的办法，为实现这个伟大的目标而奋斗。中国人民在土地改革和农业合作化的基础上，正在通过遍及整个农村有广大农民群众积极参加的伟大的人民公社运动，进一步地发展农村经济，在农村中进行社会主义建设。中国的人民公社是把农业、工业和社会生活的其他方面互相结合起来，实行政社合一，在人民公社内部实行统一领导和分级管理。为了团结最广泛的社会力量，来参加社会主义建设，中国共产党正在卓著成效地继续发挥工人阶级领导的统一战线的积极作用。所有这一切，令人信服地表明，经过一段必要的历史时间以后，中国就将由一个经济、文化落后的国家，变成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的先进的社会主义国家。
    中国共产党代表团对于意大利工人阶级和民主进步力量所进行的争取和平、民主和社会进步的斗争，对意大利共产党在这个斗争中所起的决定性作用，表示深切的同情和钦佩。意大利共产党是同意大利工人阶级和全体人民有着广泛的密切的联系的。意大利共产党为了保卫和平和充分维护意大利民族利益，为了维护意大利劳动群众的日常利益；为了保卫民主和进行经济和社会结构的改革，为了劳动群众和民主力量的团结，为了根据意大利的民族特点使意大利走向社会主义，正在进行着卓著成效的斗争。意大利的共产党、工人阶级和人民的民主进步力量的这个斗争，是世界各地进步力量所进行的伟大的进步和解放运动的一个重要部分，对于保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的事业，已经作出而且还将作出重大的贡献。
    两党一致确认，目前国际形势中的力量对比，整个说来，有利于各国人民争取世界和平、民族独立和民主进步事业。社会主义阵营的力量、民族独立运动的力量和世界和平进步的力量，对于帝国主义力量已经占了优势。他们的胜利是历史发展的不可避免的结果。社会主义阵营的欣欣向荣，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，资本主义各国人民为争取民主自由和社会进步而进行的坚持不懈的斗争，使帝国主义的危机无可挽救地日趋严重，使全体进步人类加强了对他们事业的胜利信心。但是，帝国主义者为了应付它们的不可救药的和总的危机，仍在企图加剧国际紧张局势，进行冷战，在世界上燃起挑衅之火。因此，团结一切和平、民主和进步力量，来进行保卫世界和平、缓和国际紧张局势的斗争，是共产党和工人阶级的基本任务之一。在目前，特别紧迫的问题，就是要求禁止原子武器和氢武器，实行逐步和协同一致的裁军，反对美国在外国设置军事基地，反对殖民主义和殖民战争，缔结对德和约和解决柏林问题，建立欧洲的和亚洲及太平洋地区的集体安全体系和无原子区，用和平的方法解决国际争端，实现不同社会制度的国家和平共处。
    两党代表团强调指出，苏联对于世界和平事业和缓和国际紧张局势，发挥了决定性的作用。中意两党一致赞同和支持苏联共产党和苏联政府最近提出的一系列的和平倡议。
    两党代表团确信，建立中华人民共和国和意大利共和国之间的正常关系，不仅符合两国人民的利益，而且也是对于缓和国际紧张局势、扩大世界各国之间的和平关系、促进各国文化和贸易交流事业的一个积极因素。意大利共产党代表团认为，中华人民共和国在国际上的一切合法权利，必须得到完全的承认。
    两党代表团强调指出，争取和平和社会主义斗争胜利的主要条件，是工人阶级的团结，社会主义阵营的团结和国际共产主义运动的团结。这种团结是以马克思列宁主义为基础的，是一切和平、民主和进步力量团结的核心。在1957年11月举行的各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议及其宣言，对于这种团结的巩固和发展作出了伟大的贡献。不久前举行的苏共第二十一次代表大会，标志着世界上第一个社会主义国家走上了全面建设共产主义社会的新阶段，对于社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的发展，必定发挥积极的影响。
    中意两党代表团认为，忠于马克思列宁主义原则的共产党必须始终不渝地捍卫国际共产主义运动的团结，捍卫共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言的原则，联系本国的传统和实际，反对修正主义和教条主义。两党代表团宣称，必须同国际共产主义运动中的主要危险——修正主义进行毫不调和的斗争。修正主义是资产阶级意识形态的表现，会导致工人阶级走向投降资产阶级和屈从帝国主义的道路。两党代表团同时宣称，必须坚决反对教条主义。教条主义会导致党脱离群众，成为完成革命任务的绊脚石。双方深信，人民群众具有伟大的主动精神和无穷的创造力量，马克思列宁主义能够正确表达这种精神和力量，并且能够在任何情况下成为这种精神和力量的指南。共产党之所以能够成为工人阶级先锋队，其根源就在这里。
    两党代表团确信，意大利共产党代表团访问中国，中意两党之间的会谈，将有助于发展两党之间的团结，有助于发展中国和意大利人民之间的友好关系和经济文化联系。中意两国人民一定同世界人民一起，为保卫世界和平、为发展人类文化和进步事业而努力奋斗。
    意大利共产党中央委员会邀请中国共产党中央委员会派遣代表团在适当的时候访问意大利。中国共产党中央委员会满意地接受了这个邀请。中国共产党中央委员会
