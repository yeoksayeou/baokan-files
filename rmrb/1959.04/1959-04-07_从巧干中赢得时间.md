    Winning Time Through Smart Work
    Lin Xi
    In the countryside, clocks have become a popular commodity, often in short supply. If a cadre wears a watch, he often has to answer the question "What time is it?" again and again. This is a very meaningful question. It reflects that farmers value time and cherish time more than in the past; people want to use less time to do more work and handle more affairs.
      "Don't let time go to waste," strengthen the concept of time, and be diligent every day, everywhere, and in everything. This is how comrades like Li Tianzhu, Zhang Jiangkao, and Zhang Shougong were able to do the equivalent of two years' work in one year.
    To "work smartly," greatly improve tools and enhance technology. Multiplying work efficiency is essentially multiplying the time gained. Zhang Shougong's mud-dragging boat can transport 8.9 cubic meters of night soil fertilizer per day, equivalent to four times the amount carried by others using shoulder poles. Immeasurable time can be extracted from "smart work." This is the greatest saving.
    To "arrange cleverly," integrate and organize various tasks ingeniously. This can also achieve twice the result with half the effort. Zhang Jiangkao is a production team leader, but he accumulated 610 workdays in a year, and his production leadership work was also excellent. Why? Because he combined the implementation of instructions from higher authorities, the arrangement of the team's production plan, and inspection, publicity, and mobilization with his own labor. Zhang Shougong and Li Tianzhu's principle of "never traveling empty" and "doing today's work while thinking about tomorrow's affairs" also reflects that they have a clear understanding and good arrangements when working. Therefore, they accumulated far more workdays than others.
    Time, once gone, never returns. Just imagine, if every individual or collective unit could establish the idea that "every moment is precious," how much time could be saved in daily activities, and how much more could be done with the time saved! In many places, meetings often drag on until late at night. Jinxing First Battalion of Lutou People's Commune in Zaoyang County, Hubei, experimented with a "flying meeting" system last year. These meetings are short, sharp, and concise, with clear issues, focused content, and specific tasks. They only take half an hour to an hour to complete and resolve issues. If this meeting method can be sustained and fully promoted, it can save a lot of time for production. In short, as long as we always remember that time is precious, we can save time everywhere.
    Last year's Great Leap Forward in production in our country can also be said to be a national movement to race against time and tap the potential of time. With the same amount of manpower, the annual output of grain and cotton in our country has doubled. If we hadn't won time through hard work and smart work, how would this be possible? Our work should become smarter and more refined, so that labor productivity becomes higher and higher, more and more products are produced, and life gets better and better.

    从巧干中赢得时间
    林晰
    在农村，时钟已经成为一种热门货，时常供不应求。一个干部如果戴有手表，往往需要一次又一次地回答这样一个问题：“几点钟了？”这是一个很有意义的问题。它反映出来农民比过去更加重视时间、珍惜时间了；人们要争取用更短的时间做更多的活，办更多的事情。
      “时不空过”，加强时间观念，做到日日勤、处处勤、事事勤，这就使李天柱、张江考、张守功等同志，在一年的时间里，出色地做了相当于两年的活。
    要“巧干”，大改工具，提高技术。成倍地提高工效，实质上就是成倍地赢得了时间。张守功的一条拖泥船，一天运送凼肥八点九公方，相当于别人肩挑运肥量的四倍。从“巧干”里可以挖出无法估量的时间来。这是最大的节约。
    要“巧安排”，把各项工作巧妙地结合起来，组织起来。这样，也可以收到事半功倍之效。张江考是个生产队长，但是他在一年之内却做了六百一十个劳动日，而且他的生产领导工作也做得很出色，为什么呢？因为他把贯彻执行上级的指示、安排全队的生产计划，以及检查、宣传、鼓动等等，都同自己的劳动结合起来了。张守功、李天柱“路不空行”，“干今天的活，想明天的事”，也都是在干活时心里有底，安排得好。因此，他们做的劳动日比别人多得多。
    时间一去不再来。试想，每个人或者是一个集体单位，如果都能树立起“一刻值千金”的思想，那末，在日常的活动中可以节省多少时间，又可以利用节省出来的时间做多少事情呵！不少地方经常是一开会就拖到深更半夜。湖北枣阳县鹿头人民公社金星一营，去年试行了一种“飞行会议”的制度。这种会议短小精悍，问题明确，内容集中，任务具体，只需要半小时到一小时就能开完会，就能解决问题。如果这种开会方法能够坚持下来，全面推广，那就可以节约大量的时间投入到生产中去。总之，只要时时记住时间可贵，处处都可以节约时间。
    去年我国生产大跃进，也可以说是一个全民同时间赛跑、大挖时间潜力的运动。同样是那些人力，而我国粮食、棉花年产量却都加了番。如果不是从苦干、巧干里赢得了时间，这怎么可能呢？我们的工作要越干越巧，越干越细，使劳动生产率越来越高，产品越来越多，生活也就越来越好。
