    Drilling Through the Qilian Mountains, Conquering the Gobi Desert
    Yumen Launches Oil Battle
    (Our dispatch from Yumen, April 3rd) The Yumen Oil Mine is concentrating its superior forces in the Ya'erxia new oilfield in the Jiuquan Basin, launching a fierce oil battle against the high mountains and Gobi Desert with the heroic spirit of "drilling through the Qilian Mountains and conquering the Gobi Desert."
    Currently, dozens of drilling teams are concentrated in the heart of the Ya'erxia oilfield, operating a large number of large rotary drilling rigs and turbine drilling rigs, and are rapidly drilling into the earth using fast drilling methods. Thousands of drilling workers are launching a red flag competition climax of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. In the competition, drilling team 32128 drilled 1,000 meters in six days and twenty-one hours, creating a new record. Immediately afterward, team 3219 used six days and eleven hours to create a new record. Soon, this new record was broken by team 3279 with a time of five days and twenty-three hours. Recently, team 32125 is increasing its measures, planning to drill 1,000 meters in four days, to hold the red flag of high-speed drilling even higher. Therefore, the total footage drilled has increased sharply month by month: In February, when the actual working days were fewer than in January, the footage increased by 24.5% compared with January. The footage completed in the first half of March increased by 65% compared with the same period in February. Oil extraction workers are also making technical revolutions, taking a series of technical measures for the large number of oil wells that have been drilled, so that each oil well will have high production every day and high production every month. After treatment, the output of many oil wells has increased by several times to more than ten times, and some oil wells are producing more than 100 tons of crude oil per day. Oilfield construction workers are also laying oil and water pipelines and installing oil extraction and storage equipment at a rate of construction that is several times faster than in the past, day and night. They want to let the dark brown crude oil obediently flow along the oil pipelines to the Yumen Refinery and the Yumen Railway Station oil depot.
    (Our dispatch from Yumen, April 3rd) The workers of the Yumen Oil Mine Refinery used eighty-two days to build a large refinery with an annual processing capacity of more than 500,000 tons. This refinery has started production on March 27th, and it can refine gasoline, aviation kerosene, diesel, and other petroleum products.
    After mobilizing the masses, rummaging through boxes and cabinets, and exploring the potential of materials, the Yumen Oil Mine Refinery used indigenous and foreign methods to overcome many difficulties in building the factory. They adopted various methods such as digging, finding, substituting, making, and saving to solve 60% of the materials and equipment needed for building the factory. The Yumen Mining Bureau also transferred a batch of stagnant materials and equipment from various units of the entire mine to support the factory's construction needs. The designers also broke away from the past design ideas of "high standards, regularization," and blindly believing in books, going deep into the field and repeatedly studying with the workers, simplifying the design using existing materials while ensuring quality. They also promoted the method of designing, manufacturing, and constructing and installing simultaneously, which not only saved a large amount of steel but also greatly accelerated the speed of factory construction. Because more than 70% of the solved equipment was waste and idle equipment not used for refining, the workers used the method of vigorously carrying out technical innovations to repair and modify them for use, and also paid attention to saving as much as possible during installation. The workers put forward more than 2,300 rationalization proposals and created some advanced tools and construction methods, which increased the speed of equipment manufacturing and construction and installation by one to more than forty times.

    钻透祁连山　战胜戈壁滩
    玉门掀起夺油大战
    本报玉门3日电　玉门油矿正集中优势兵力，在酒泉盆地鸭儿峡新油田上，以“钻透祁连山、战胜戈壁滩”的英雄气概，向高山戈壁展开了激烈的夺油大战。
    目前，几十个钻井队正集中在鸭儿峡油田的心脏地区，操纵着大批大型旋转钻机和涡轮钻机，采用快速钻井法猛烈地向地心钻进。数千名钻井工人正在掀起一个比先进、学先进、赶先进的红旗竞赛高潮。在竞赛中三二一二八钻井队用六天零二十一小时钻进了一千公尺，创造了新纪录以后，紧接着三二一九队就用六天零十一小时，创造了新纪录。不久，这一新纪录又被三二七九队用五天零二十三小时的成绩突破。最近，三二一二五队。使措施加码，计划用四天时间钻一千公尺，要把高速度钻井的红旗举得更高。因此，钻井总进尺逐月激增：实际工作日比元月份少的2月份，进尺却比元月份增加了24.5％，3月份上中旬完成的进尺，和2月份同期相比增加了65％。采油工人也大闹技术革命，对已钻成的大批油井，采取了一系列的技术措施，使每口油井要日日高产，月月高产。许多油井经处理后，产量提高了几倍到十几倍，一些油井日喷原油在百吨以上。油田建设工人也以超过往日数倍的惊人建设速度，日夜紧张地敷设输油、输水管线，和安装采油、储油设备。要让棕黑色原油，驯顺地顺着输油管线流向玉门炼油厂和玉门火车站油库。
    本报玉门3日电　玉门油矿炼油厂职工，用八十二天的时间，建成了一座年加工能力为五十多万吨的大型炼油厂。这座炼油厂已在3月27日开始生产，它可以炼制汽油、航空煤油、柴油和其他石油产品。
    玉门油矿炼油厂经过发动群众，翻箱倒柜，挖掘器材潜力，用土洋结合办法，克服许多建厂困难。他们采用挖、找、代、制、省等多种办法，解决了建厂需要的60％的器材设备。玉门矿务局又从全矿各单位调剂出一批呆滞器材设备，支援了炼油厂建厂需要。设计人员也打破以往按“高标准、正规化”、一味迷信书本的设计思想，深入现场，和工人一道反复研究，在保证质量的前提下，因陋就简，就现有材料进行设计；又推行了边设计、边制造、边施工安装的方法，不但节省了大批钢材，还大大加快了建厂速度。解决的器材，由于70％以上都是废旧材料和非炼油应用的闲置设备，职工们就用大搞技术革命的办法，加以修复，改制使用，安装时还尽量注意节约。职工们共提出两千三百多条合理化建议，创造了一些先进工具和施工方法，使设备的制造和施工安装速度，提高了一倍到四十多倍。
