Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 31st. The Secretariat of the National Committee of the Communist Party of India issued a statement to the press on March 31 regarding the Tibetan issue. The statement pointed out that the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence require India not to interfere in China's internal affairs regarding the Tibetan rebellion. The statement said, "This also means that we should not allow our territory to be used for hostile or detrimental activities against the other party."

The statement pointed out that those who launched the rebellion in Tibet were "reactionaries unwilling to move forward with the times, serf owners who wanted to prevent modern civilization and the dawn of equality from appearing in Tibet. These elements improperly used the trust placed in them by the Chinese People's Democratic Government, took advantage of the Chinese government's extreme respect for Tibetan autonomy, and colluded with foreign imperialists to instigate rebellion. The Chinese government decided to give them time, but they used the time to plot a counter-revolutionary rebellion."

The statement said, "These elements are neither fighting for democracy nor for freedom. The fact that they have gained the sympathy and support of Chiang Kai-shek and the American imperialists is enough to show that they are completely reactionary. In fact, these elements would not have been able to launch a counter-revolutionary rebellion without the active support of imperialism."

The statement also said: "India's own security has suffered from imperialist conspiracies, whether in Goa, Kashmir, or on the Pakistan border. The same conspiracy was organized in Tibet. We should be pleased that our neighbor has successfully crushed the imperialist conspiracy on our border."

The statement emphasized, "India has always recognized Tibet as a part of China. The famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were born in our agreement on Tibet. These principles require us to strictly adhere to neutrality and non-interference in internal affairs."

Referring to the Kalimpong issue, the statement said, "We all know that many ambiguous things are happening in Kalimpong, and many suspicious foreigners are visiting this place. Not only for the inviolability of our land, but also for the interests of our two countries, our government should immediately investigate the events in Kalimpong and tell the people the truth."

The statement said that the Indian government and Nehru have adopted an appropriate attitude on the Tibetan issue and refused to accept the demands of the reactionaries, and every Indian in our country will be happy about this. However, there are still a few reactionary elements and political parties such as the People's Socialist Party and the Indian People's League, who are trying to stir up anti-China sentiment in India. When the US-Pakistan agreement, which directly threatened India's security, was signed, these "fighters for freedom and democracy" remained silent. One of their goals is to create discord between the friendly people of India and China. By doing so, they are only serving American imperialism.

### 印度共产党书记处就西藏问题发表声明

    印度共产党书记处就西藏问题发表声明
   “印度一向承认西藏是中国的一部分，著名的和平共处五项原则就是在我们关于西藏的协议中诞生的。这些原则要求我们严格地遵守中立，互不干涉内政。”
    新华社新德里3月31日电　印度共产党全国委员会书记处在3月31日就西藏问题向报界发表声明。声明指出，著名的和平共处五项原则要求印度在西藏叛乱问题上不干涉中国内政。声明说：“这也意味着我们不应该容许我们的领土被用来进行敌对或损害对方的活动。”
    声明指出，在西藏发动叛乱的是“不愿意跟着时代前进的反动派，是想阻止现代文明以及平等的曙光在西藏出现的农奴主。这些分子不正当地使用中国人民民主政府给予他们的信任，利用了中国政府极为尊重西藏自治的情况，和外国帝国主义勾结，策动叛乱。中国政府决定给他们时间，但是他们却利用时间来策动反革命叛乱”。
    声明说：“这些分子既不是争取民主，也不是争取自由。他们获得蒋介石和美帝国主义者的同情和支持这一事实就足以表明，他们是完全反动的。实际上，这些分子如果没有帝国主义的积极支持，他们是不能够发动反革命叛乱的。”
    声明还说：“无论在果阿、克什米尔还是在巴基斯坦边境上，印度自己的安全也遭受帝国主义的阴谋之害。在西藏组织了同样的阴谋。我们的邻国已经成功地粉碎了帝国主义在我们边境那边进行的阴谋，我们应当对此感到高兴。”
    声明强调说，“印度一向承认西藏是中国的一部分，著名的和平共处五项原则就是在我们关于西藏的协议中诞生的。这些原则要求我们严格地遵守中立，互不干涉内政。”
    谈到噶伦堡问题时，声明说，“我们大家知道，在噶伦堡正在发生许多暧昧的事情，许多可疑的外国人正在这个地方访问。不仅为了我们的国土的神圣不可侵犯，而且也为了我们两国的利益，我国政府应该立即对噶伦堡的事件进行调查，并把真相告诉人民。”
    声明说，印度政府和尼赫鲁在西藏问题上采取了适当的态度，拒绝接受反动分子的要求，我国的每一个印度人将会对此感到高兴。但是仍旧有少数反动分子和政党如人民社会党和印度人民同盟，正企图在印度掀起反对中国的情绪。当直接威胁着印度安全的美国—巴基斯坦协定签字的时候，这些“保卫自由和民主的战士”却保持沉默。他们的一个目的就是在印中两国友好的人民之间制造不和。他们这样作只是为美帝国主义效劳而已。
