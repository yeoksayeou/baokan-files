    Hanoi is undergoing large-scale construction, carrying out massive basic construction projects. It is expected that the number of buildings constructed in the city this year will be four times more than last year; the amount of construction in the first quarter alone is equal to the total amount of construction last year.
    This year, a total of 53 large and small projects will be undertaken, including a number of building materials factories and daily necessities factories, eighteen schools, a number of residential buildings for the working people, and office buildings. They will be built in the four suburbs within six kilometers of Hanoi's urban area, making the suburbs more magnificent.
    The stationery, soap, and cigarette factories that have already begun construction will, once completed, produce more than half of North Vietnam's need for these products. The stationery factory will produce the first batch of domestically produced fountain pens in Vietnamese history.
    The three universities and seven secondary technical schools to be built within the year will be able to accommodate approximately three thousand students each year, studying various professional knowledge in law, agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, sports, meteorology, and other fields. A large number of students will soon participate in voluntary labor to construct these projects.
    In order to implement the construction policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical," Hanoi's builders are making every effort to utilize some old buildings to be rebuilt into new buildings, in order to save funds and speed up construction. Due to the effective organization of the labor force and the strengthening of mechanized construction, the construction speed on Hanoi construction sites in the first quarter of this year was more than 50% faster than last year.
    Currently, thousands of voluntary laborers are filling soil and laying foundations on the construction site of Hanoi's famous Seven Acres Lake labor area, preparing to build theaters, residences, and gardens here; at the same time, they are also dredging the silt from the bottom of the lake to turn the lake into a swimming pool. People want to build this area into a paradise for working people's entertainment and rest.

    河内大兴土木
    河内正在大兴土木，进行大规模的基本建设。预计，今年在这个城市中，将建设比去年多四倍的建筑物；仅第一季度的建设量就等于去年全年的建设量。
    今年将兴建的大小工程共五十三项，其中包括一批建筑器材工厂和日用百货工厂、十八所学校、一批劳动人民住宅和办公楼等。它们将建设在距河内市区六公里以内的四郊，把郊区建设得更加壮丽。
    目前已经动工兴建的文具、肥皂、纸烟等工厂在建成以后，它们生产的产品将达到全北越对这些产品的需要量的一半以上。文具厂将生产越南历史上的第一批国产自来水笔。
    将在年内建成的三所大专学校和七所中等技术学校，每年将可容纳大约三千名学生学习司法、农林、水利、体育、气象等各种专业知识。大批学生即将参加建设这些工程的义务劳动。
    为了贯彻“多、快、好、省”的建设方针，河内市建设者尽量利用一部分旧建筑物来改建为新的建筑物，以节约资金和加速建设速度。由于有效地组织了劳动力和加强了机械化施工，在今年第一季度，河内建设工地的施工速度比去年快50％以上。
    目前，每天有成千名义务劳动大军在河内著名的七亩湖劳动区工地填土、打地基，准备在这里建筑剧院、住宅和花园；同时还挖掘湖底的淤泥，把湖泊变为游泳池。人们要把这一带建设成为劳动人民娱乐、休息的乐园。
