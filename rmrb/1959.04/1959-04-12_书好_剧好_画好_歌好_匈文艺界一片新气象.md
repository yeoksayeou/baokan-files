    A New Atmosphere in Hungarian Literary and Art Circles

    An encouraging new atmosphere has emerged in Hungarian literary and art circles. Today, the broad masses of the Hungarian people can see in literary works, dramas, films, and paintings and sculptures, their own heroic struggles to defeat the counter-revolution and to defend and build socialism.

    Many Hungarian writers and poets are actively engaged in creation. The number of artistic works reflecting reality is gradually increasing. In 1958 alone, 169 such works were published, accounting for 40% of the year's literary and art publications. This year, 186 kinds of Hungarian modern literary works will be published, with a circulation of one million copies.

    Hungarian theaters staged many good plays reflecting socialist reality. These plays exposed the essence of the October counter-revolutionary events and reflected the heroic struggle of workers and working peasants to defend socialism. These plays were warmly welcomed by the audience after their performances. For more than a year, many bands have gone deep into factories and rural areas to perform songs and folk songs for workers and peasants. Last year alone, more than 1,000 concerts were held across the country. At present, almost all larger rural areas have established bands.

    The achievements mentioned above are mainly due to the struggle against revisionism and all kinds of bourgeois ideology carried out by the Hungarian literary and art circles under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party. Many intellectuals have improved their political and ideological understanding in the struggle, making the ranks of progressive literary and art workers increasingly consolidated and expanded.

    匈文艺界一片新气象
    匈牙利文艺界出现了令人鼓舞的新气象。今天匈牙利的广大人民，可以在文学作品、戏剧电影以及绘画雕像中，看到自己为战胜反革命、为保卫和建设社会主义而进行的英勇斗争。
    很多的匈牙利作家和诗人，都在积极地从事创作。反映现实的艺术作品的数量在逐渐增多。仅1958年就出版了一百六十九种这样的作品，占全年文艺出版物的40％。今年将出版一百八十六种匈牙利的现代文学作品，发行额将达一百万册。
    匈牙利各戏院上演了许多反映社会主义现实的好戏。这些戏揭露了十月反革命事件的本质，反映了工人和劳动农民保卫社会主义的英勇斗争。这些戏演出后受到观众们的热烈欢迎。一年多以来很多乐队深入工厂和农村为工人、农民们演奏歌曲和民歌。仅去年一年，全国就举行了一千多次音乐会。目前较大的农村差不多都成立了乐队。
    上述成绩的取得，主要是由于在社会主义工人党的领导下匈牙利文艺界开展了反对修正主义和各式各样的资产阶级思想的斗争。很多知识分子在斗争中提高了政治思想认识，使进步文艺工作者的队伍日益巩固和扩大。
