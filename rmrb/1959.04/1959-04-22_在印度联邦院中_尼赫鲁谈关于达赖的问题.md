Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 21st. According to the Indian News Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, while answering questions in the Council of States on the 20th, again spoke about "several questions regarding the Dalai Lama."

Nehru said, "The Dalai Lama will definitely be given the freedom to carry out his proper religious activities." He said, "As far as political activities are concerned, activities against one country cannot be carried out from another country."

In response to a question from a member of parliament regarding "whether Tibetan exiles will be prevented from expressing their views on the future of Tibet," Nehru said, "The government has allowed a very wide range of freedom of speech." Regarding the publication of the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" that advocated the so-called "independence" of Tibetans, Nehru said that the Indian "government did not obstruct it." Nehru said, "The Dalai Lama is a responsible person," and said, "There is no doubt that he will act in a responsible manner. However, there are so many other people, and it is not known what they will do." Nehru also said, "The government naturally expects the Tibetans who have come to India not to do anything that would make the country's relations with China difficult."

Nehru said, "The host country has the right to restrict the activities of foreigners if these activities cause difficulties with other countries." However, he also said, "But how much restriction depends on the environment and circumstances."

According to the Press Trust of India, Nehru also said that no one has proposed limiting the number of Tibetans who can enter India.

    在印度联邦院中
    尼赫鲁谈关于达赖的问题
    新华社新德里21日电　据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁20日在联邦院答复质询时，再次谈到“若干关于达赖喇嘛的问题”。
    尼赫鲁说，“达赖喇嘛肯定将被给予进行他的正当的宗教活动的自由”。他说，“就政治活动而言，不能从一个国家进行反对另一国家的活动”。
    在回答议员提出的关于“是否将阻止西藏流亡者表示他们对西藏前途的意见”的问题时，尼赫鲁说，“政府已经把言论自由的尺度放得很宽”。对于那个鼓吹西藏人的所谓“独立”的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的发表，尼赫鲁说，印度“政府并没有阻挠”。尼赫鲁说“达赖喇嘛是一个负责的人”，并且说，“毫无疑问，他会以负责的方式行事。可是，还有这么多别的人，不知道他们会怎样做。”尼赫鲁又说，“政府自然期望已经到印度的西藏人不做任何会使这个国家同中国的关系为难的事情”。
    尼赫鲁说，“东道国有权限制外国人的活动，如果这些活动造成同其他国家的困难的话。”但是，他又说，“可是限制的程度多大要看环境和情况而定”。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，尼赫鲁还说，没有人提议限制能够进入印度的西藏人的人数。
