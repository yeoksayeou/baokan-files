Xinhua News Agency, April 26th. Representatives and committee members of minority nationalities attending the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, at the invitation of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, held a garden party today at the Summer Palace.

Today, the capital was bathed in warm sunshine, and Kunming Lake rippled with gentle waves. From the painted boats carrying representatives and committee members of various ethnic groups, joyous laughter and conversation constantly emanated.

Ulanhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, along with Vice Chairmen of the Nationalities Affairs Commission Wang Feng, Liu Chun, Sa Kongliao, Yang Jingren, and Xie Hechou, Vice Chairman of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, Xie Fumin, and Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, Xue Zizheng, also joined the representatives and committee members of various ethnic groups in touring the garden.

Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government stationed in Tibet, also participated in today's garden party.

As the yacht carrying Ulanhu, Bainqen Erdini, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Wang Feng, Zhang Jingwu, and others cruised around the lake shore, tourists in the pavilions, terraces, and galleries along the shore warmly applauded and welcomed them. Bainqen Erdini sometimes gazed out the window, sometimes stood at the bow of the boat, smiling and constantly waving to the welcoming tourists. Inside the yacht, Ulanhu and Bainqen Erdini engaged in cordial conversation.

At noon, melodious music resounded in the Hall for Listening to Orioles. The representatives and committee members of various ethnic groups gathered together, watching wonderful performances presented by the Central National Song and Dance Ensemble and the Dance Training Class of the Central Institute for Nationalities, including the beautiful Lhasa song and dance: "Gebasangbu."

The Summer Palace is now full of spring, with a riot of blooming flowers. Bainqen Erdini and others also toured the Long Corridor and other buildings. Today's garden party lasted for more than five hours. (Attached picture)
