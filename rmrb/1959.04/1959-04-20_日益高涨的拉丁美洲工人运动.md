　　The Rising Tide of the Latin American Workers' Movement
　　Wan Zhongmin Lu Yanlin

　　Extensive Strike Struggles

　　The Latin American working class is launching a magnificent struggle to improve their living conditions and defend national interests.

　　A wave of strikes is sweeping across the Latin American continent. In larger countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and Mexico, large-scale mass demonstrations and strikes have erupted continuously in recent months. Strikers and demonstrators strongly oppose the sharp rise in domestic living costs and the further enslavement and plunder of the working people by foreign monopoly capital. Major strikes include: the national general strike that broke out in Argentina in mid-January, involving workers from all walks of life, which was held to oppose the handover of state-owned slaughterhouses and refrigeration plants to American monopoly capital and to protest the government's so-called "economic stabilization plan" that benefits American monopoly capital. Brazil has recently experienced two strikes involving more than 10,000 people in a row, demanding wage increases and opposing price increases. In late February, 70,000 Mexican railway workers went on strike to demand wage increases and improved living and welfare conditions, paralyzing most of Mexico's railway transportation. The working people of Colombia have been holding continuous demonstrations for more than a month since February to oppose rising living costs, and demonstrators have generally demanded the nationalization of oil. The strike by workers at the Frontino gold mine in Colombia, operated by American capital, has lasted for more than forty days. Due to the American company's refusal to meet the workers' demands, a large-scale support movement is now unfolding across the country.

　　The Latin American working class's struggle to improve its living conditions and defend its national interests has been continuously strengthened in the past two years, with workers' strikes rising one after another. Taking Bolivia as an example, 292 strikes were held in the first ten months of 1957, while in the last five months of 1958, the number of strikes reached 507. In Argentina, a total of 1,294 strikes broke out from July 1957 to July 1958, involving 7.38 million people. Even in Paraguay, under the cruel rule of the Stroessner dictatorship fostered by the United States, and in Puerto Rico, under the direct rule of the United States, workers have been waging arduous strike struggles for the past two years. This surge of strikes has formed an unstoppable torrent in the national democratic movement.

　　Defending National Interests and the Right to Survival

　　This new upsurge in the Latin American workers' movement is the inevitable result of the intensification of economic plunder of these countries by American imperialism and the increasingly impoverished lives of the working people.

　　Since the outbreak of the economic crisis in the United States in 1957, the United States has used its economic and political control over the region, which has gradually formed since World War II, in an attempt to shift the crisis onto the people of Latin America. On the one hand, it has lowered the prices of raw materials in Latin American countries and restricted the import of raw materials; on the other hand, it has dumped large quantities of its surplus agricultural products to these countries and raised the prices of industrial products exported to these countries, thereby pushing Latin American countries to the brink of economic bankruptcy.

　　In the past two years, Latin American countries have experienced huge fiscal deficits due to a significant decrease in foreign trade income, the number of unemployed people in the country has been increasing, and inflation has caused prices to rise sharply, making workers' lives increasingly difficult. Taking Brazil as an example, the trade deficit in 1958 was more than double that of the previous year. In order to make up for the fiscal deficit, Brazil has continuously issued more currency since 1957, which has caused inflation, causing living costs to rise by 43% from July 1957 to November 1958, but workers' wages have hardly increased. Other Latin American countries are in similar situations. In this way, the working class and other working people, who are the first to suffer the greatest damage, have to stand up first to defend national interests and wage continuous struggles for the right to survival.

　　The Latin American working class has realized from its own experience that the increasingly impoverished lives of the working people are inseparable from the economic plunder of American imperialism. Therefore, in their struggle to meet economic demands, they often put forward slogans to defend national interests and oppose imperialism, closely combining economic struggles with political struggles, the struggle for democracy with the struggle against imperialism, forming a new feature of the current Latin American workers' movement. For example, in Brazil's recent struggle against soaring prices, the trade union leader of São Paulo put forward to the government the demands to restrict the interests of foreign companies and protect and develop national industries in order to fundamentally stabilize prices. In Colombia, the working people there generally demanded the nationalization of American-operated oil companies in demonstrations against rising urban transportation costs. Thanks to the resolute struggle of the slaughterhouse and refrigeration workers in Uruguay, the Uruguayan parliament had to pass a bill to confiscate two refrigeration plants operated by the United States last October.

　　In the movement to defend national wealth, the Argentine working class has waged an uncompromising struggle in recent years. Although the government has taken repressive measures, it cannot frustrate the will of the working class to struggle. Last November, the strike launched by the Argentine working class to defend the country's oil resources forced the government to cancel the oil contract that was scheduled to be signed with the American company. In January of this year, the strike held by workers at the Argentine state-owned slaughterhouse and refrigeration plant to oppose the operation of the plant by foreign companies and the so-called "economic stabilization plan," due to the widespread support of Argentina's three largest trade unions and people of other strata, formed a large-scale national general strike.

　　The Latin American working class not only plays a pioneering role in the struggle to defend national interests, but has also become a backbone force against imperialist political enslavement.

　　The reason why the two pro-American dictators—Jiménez of Venezuela and Batista of Cuba—were overthrown last January and New Year's Day this year is precisely because the working class participated in this struggle. In September last year, when Venezuela faced an armed rebellion, one million Venezuelan workers held a nationwide general strike, demanding that the government arrest and punish the rebels. In Caracas, where the conspiracy to rebel occurred, the workers immediately took to the streets after receiving the trade union's call to defend the fruits of democracy, built barricades, and occupied the barracks of the rebel army, thereby helping the government to stop the danger of an armed rebellion.

　　The Latin American working class is playing an increasingly important role in the political life of various countries, especially in the movement for democracy and national independence. This is because the struggle slogans put forward by the working class itself are in line with the interests of the nation and have won the support of people from all walks of life. The Argentine working class's struggle to defend the country's wealth and oppose imperialist economic plunder has won the support of students, citizens, clerks, businessmen, and nationalists. On the other hand, the reason why the working class can play a major role in the political life of various countries is because the working class itself has grown unprecedentedly in the process of foreign monopoly capital's massive investment in the Latin American region. After World War II, the number of workers in Latin American countries has nearly doubled. The industrial, transportation, and construction workers in only eight countries including Brazil, Argentina, and Chile have reached 10 million.

　　Striving for Unity and Joint Action

　　The growing ranks of the Latin American workers are becoming increasingly powerful organized and unified political forces in the struggle.

　　In addition to Chile, where a national unified trade union was formed in 1953 under the promotion of progressive forces, the unified organization of trade unions is currently taking shape in many Latin American countries; in other countries, the influence of progressive trade union organizations is growing, and the right-wing trade union leadership groups are becoming increasingly isolated. For example, the Uruguayan General Confederation of Labor united all independent trade unions to form a preparatory committee for a unified trade union, while many unionized trade unions that originally belonged to the right-wing General Confederation of Labor have withdrawn one after another, showing a favorable situation in the Uruguayan trade union unification movement. In Brazil, although the government has declared the progressive General Confederation of Labor illegal in the past and prohibited the establishment of a national General Confederation of Labor, in recent years, progressive forces have not only expanded and consolidated their positions in the masses and grassroots trade unions, but also gained advantages in certain sectors in industrial cities such as São Paulo. Last year, many state or national industry-based trade union federations were newly established in Brazil, and trade unions took joint actions by signing unity agreements and establishing consultation mechanisms. In some countries where the trade union movement has suffered more serious divisions, the process of unification is also developing. Even in Paraguay under dictatorial rule, members of the police group who originally occupied the leading position in the trade union were removed from their positions at the trade union congress held in 1957.

　　Despite the US reactionary group's best efforts to conspire to split the unity and joint action of the workers' movement in Latin American countries, the struggle for unity and unification of the workers' movement is developing further. In February this year, Latin American Labor Alliance Secretary Moreno and representatives from Chile, Venezuela, Uruguay, Mexico, and other countries exchanged information and opinions on the Latin American workers' movement in Santiago, Chile. They issued a call to establish a Latin American Labor Unified Trade Union to strengthen the unity between trade unions of various countries. This call has aroused strong reactions in some countries. At the meeting held by Argentine trade union leaders and Chilean trade union leaders in early April this year, the issue of organizing a joint front for the Latin American trade union movement was discussed. The action program of this joint front is to strive for the economic independence of Latin American countries, oppose colonialism and dictatorial rule, defend trade union rights, and strive to improve living and working conditions. The above-mentioned initiative to organize a joint front of trade unions has been supported by the trade unions of Venezuela and Haiti.

　　The strength of the working class and the intensity of the struggle have alarmed American imperialism. American imperialism is intensifying the suppression of the workers' movement through the governments of some Latin American countries. In March this year, when Mexican railway workers went on strike, the government arrested a large number of trade union leaders. Striking workers in Argentina were subjected to brutal repression, and a large number of workers were arrested and conscripted into the army. American imperialism has recently launched an anti-communist movement in some Latin American countries under the pretext of communist "instigation" of workers' strikes, in an attempt to cover up the truth of workers' strike struggles. But all these despicable tricks are in vain. Argentine Communist Party General Secretary Codovilla recently made a statement to Chile's "El Siglo" on the domestic situation, pointing out that today is no longer an era of dictatorial rule and colonialism. The road for the working class and progressive forces to advance cannot be blocked. They are fighting to create a prosperous, democratic, politically and economically independent Argentina. Codovilla's words express the irresistible and growing trend of the Latin American workers' movement.

　　日益高涨的拉丁美洲工人运动
　　万钟民　陆彦林
    声势浩大的罢工斗争
    拉丁美洲的工人阶级为争取改善本身的生活状况和捍卫民族的利益正在展开一个规模壮阔的斗争。
    罢工的浪潮席卷了拉丁美洲整个大陆。在阿根廷、巴西、秘鲁、哥伦比亚、玻利维亚和墨西哥这些比较大的国家里，近几个月来接连不断地爆发了大规模的群众性的游行示威和罢工斗争。罢工和游行示威者强烈反对国内生活费用的急遽上涨和外国垄断资本对劳动人民的进一步奴役和掠夺。在这些罢工斗争中规模比较大的有：1月中旬在阿根廷爆发的包括有各行各业工人参加的全国总罢工，这次罢工是因为反对把国营屠宰冷藏厂交给美国垄断资本和抗议政府执行有利于美国垄断资本的所谓“稳定经济计划”而举行的。巴西最近两个月连续发生了两次万人以上的罢工，要求增加工资和反对物价上涨。墨西哥七万名铁路工人在2月下旬为要求增加工资和改善生活福利而举行了罢工，这次罢工使墨西哥的铁路运输绝大部分处于瘫痪状态。哥伦比亚的劳动人民从2月开始连续举行了一个多月的示威游行，反对生活费用上涨，示威者还普遍要求实行石油国有化。美资在哥伦比亚经营的弗龙蒂诺金矿的工人举行的罢工已经坚持了四十多天，由于美国公司拒绝工人的要求，现在在全国正展开一个声势浩大的支援运动。
    拉丁美洲工人阶级为改善本身的生活状况和捍卫民族利益的斗争，在过去两年来就不断增强，工人的罢工此伏彼起。以玻利维亚为例，1957年头十个月举行了二百九十二次罢工，而在1958年最后五个月中，罢工的次数就达到五百零七次。阿根廷从1957年7月至1958年7月一年中，共爆发了一千二百九十四次罢工，参加人数达七百三十八万。在美国一手扶植的斯特罗斯纳独裁者残酷统治下的巴拉圭，以至美国直接统治下的波多黎各，工人们两年来也都进行了艰苦的罢工斗争。这种罢工斗争汹涌澎湃，形成了民族民主运动中一股势不可挡的巨流。
    保卫民族利益和生存权利
    拉丁美洲工人运动这种新的高涨，是由于美帝国主义加紧了对这些国家的经济掠夺，劳动人民的生活日趋贫困的必然结果。
    自1957年美国爆发经济危机以来，美国利用它从第二次世界大战后逐渐形成的对这个地区经济上、政治上的控制，力图把危机转嫁到拉丁美洲人民的头上。它一方面压低拉丁美洲国家的原料价格、限制原料进口；另一方面向这些国家大量倾销其剩余农产品，并提高向这些国家输出的工业品价格。从而把拉丁美洲国家推向经济破产的边缘。
    近两年来，拉丁美洲各国由于对外贸易收入大大减少，出现了巨大的财政赤字，国内的失业人数在不断增加，而通货膨胀，使物价直线上升，工人生活日益困苦。以巴西为例，1958年的贸易逆差比前一年增加一倍以上。为了弥补财政上的赤字，巴西从1957年以来不断增发货币，因此引起通货膨胀，使得生活费用从1957年7月到1958年11月上涨了43％，但是工人的工资却几乎没有什么增加。拉丁美洲其他国家也都处于类似的状况。这样，首先遭到最大损害的工人阶级和其他劳动人民，不得不首先起来捍卫民族利益，为争取生存权利而进行不断的斗争。
    拉丁美洲的工人阶级从切身的经验认识到，劳动人民生活的日趋贫困是和美帝国主义在经济上的掠夺分不开的。因此，他们在为满足经济要求而进行的斗争中，往往提出保卫民族利益和反对帝国主义的斗争口号，使经济斗争和政治斗争、争取民主的斗争和反对帝国主义的斗争密切结合，构成目前拉丁美洲工人运动的新的特点。例如，在巴西最近为反对物价暴涨而进行的斗争中，圣保罗的工会领袖向政府提出限制外国公司利益和保护与发展民族工业的要求，以便从根本上稳定物价。在哥伦比亚，那里的劳动人民在反对城市交通费用上涨的示威游行中，普遍提出了把美国经营的石油公司收归国有的要求。由于乌拉圭屠宰冷藏工人的坚决斗争，乌拉圭议会不得不在去年10月通过一项征收美国经营的两家冷藏厂的法案。
    在保卫民族财富的运动中，阿根廷的工人阶级近年来曾经进行了毫不妥协的斗争。政府虽然采取了镇压措施，但也不能挫折工人阶级的斗争意志。去年11月，阿根廷工人阶级为保卫国家的石油资源而发起的罢工，迫使政府不得不取消预定要同美国公司签订的石油合同。今年1月，阿根廷国营屠宰冷藏厂工人为反对把工厂交给外国公司经营和所谓“稳定经济计划”而举行的罢工，由于得到阿根廷全国最大的三个工会以及其他阶层人民的广泛支持，形成了声势浩大的全国总罢工。
    拉丁美洲的工人阶级不但在保卫民族利益的斗争中起着急先锋的作用，而且已经成为反对帝国主义政治上的奴役的一支中坚力量。
    去年1月和今年元旦两个亲美的独裁者——委内瑞拉的希门尼斯和古巴的巴蒂斯塔所以能够被推翻，正是由于工人阶级参加了这个斗争。去年9月间，当委内瑞拉面临武装叛乱的局面时，委内瑞拉一百万工人举行了全国规模的总罢工，要求政府逮捕和惩处叛乱分子。在发生叛乱阴谋的加拉加斯，工人们在接到工会保卫民主果实的号召后立即涌上街头，筑起街垒，并且占领了叛军的营房，从而帮助政府制止了一次武装叛乱的危险。
    拉丁美洲工人阶级在各国的政治生活中，特别是在争取民主和民族独立运动中正在发挥越来越大的作用，这是因为工人阶级本身提出的斗争口号符合民族的利益，得到了各阶层人士的支持。阿根廷工人阶级为保卫国家的财富和反对帝国主义经济上的掠夺的斗争，得到学生、市民、职员、商人和民族主义者的支持。另一方面，工人阶级所以能够在各国的政治生活中起重大的作用，是由于在外国垄断资本对拉丁美洲地区进行大量投资过程中，工人阶级本身空前的壮大起来了。在第二次大战以后，拉丁美洲国家工人的人数增加了将近一倍，仅巴西、阿根廷、智利等八个国家的工业、运输和建筑工人就达一千万人。
    争取团结和统一行动
    日益壮大的拉丁美洲工人队伍在斗争中正在成为越来越强大的有组织的和统一行动的政治力量。
    除了智利早在1953年在进步力量的推动下由各派工会组成了全国性的统一工会以外，目前工会的统一组织正在拉丁美洲许多国家形成；在另一些国家，进步工会组织的影响日益扩大，右翼的工会领导集团越来越孤立。例如，乌拉圭总工会团结所有的独立工会组成了统一工会筹备委员会，而许多原来属于右翼总工会的会员工会却相继退出，出现了乌拉圭工会统一运动的有利形势。在巴西，尽管政府在过去宣布进步的总工会为非法，并且禁止成立全国性的总工会，但是几年来进步力量不仅在群众和基层工会中扩大和巩固了阵地，还在圣保罗等工业城市某些部门中取得了优势。去年在巴西新成立了许多州的或全国行业性的工会联合会，各工会采取订立团结协定、成立协商机构等方式采取共同行动。在一些工会运动遭到比较严重的分裂的国家，统一的过程也在发展中，甚至在独裁统治下的巴拉圭，原来在工会中占据领导地位的警察集团成员，也在1957年举行的工会代表大会上被撤销了职务。
    尽管美国反动集团千方百计地阴谋分裂拉丁美洲各国工人运动的团结和统一行动，但是工人运动为团结和统一而进行的斗争正在进一步发展。今年2月间，拉丁美洲劳工联盟书记摩伦诺和智利、委内瑞拉、乌拉圭、墨西哥等国家的代表曾在智利圣地亚哥就拉丁美洲的工人运动交换了情况和意见，他们发出了成立一个拉丁美洲劳工统一工会来加强各国工会间的团结的号召。这一号召已经在一些国家中引起强烈的反应。在今年4月初阿根廷工会领袖和智利工会领袖举行的会议上，曾经讨论了组织拉丁美洲工会运动联合阵线的问题。这个联合阵线的行动纲领是争取拉丁美洲各国的经济独立，反对殖民主义和独裁统治，保卫工会权利和争取改善生活和劳动条件。上述组织工会联合阵线的创议，已经得到委内瑞拉和海地工会的支持。
    工人阶级力量的强大和斗争的激烈，已经使得美帝国主义惊惶失措。美帝国主义正在通过一些拉丁美洲国家的政府来加紧镇压工人运动。今年3月，当墨西哥铁路工人举行罢工时，政府逮捕了大批工人工会领袖。阿根廷罢工的工人受到残酷的镇压，大批工人被逮捕和被征召入伍。美帝国主义最近还在拉丁美洲一些国家中以共产党“煽动”工人罢工为借口掀起反共运动，企图掩饰工人罢工斗争的真相。但是这一切卑鄙的勾当都是枉然的。阿根廷共产党总书记柯都维亚最近就国内局势向智利“世纪报”发表谈话时指出，今天已经不是独裁统治和殖民主义的时代了，工人阶级和进步力量前进的道路是堵塞不住的，他们正在为创造一个繁荣、民主、政治和经济独立的阿根廷而奋斗。柯都维亚的话表达了拉丁美洲工人运动不可阻挡的日益发展的趋势。
