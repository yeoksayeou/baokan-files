Chairman, fellow deputies:

In the short few years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the hard work of the people of the whole country, our country has achieved unprecedented construction achievements and national economic development in the first five-year plan. These amazing facts highlight the superiority and reality of the planned economy under the socialist system. Last year, on the basis of the successful completion of the first five-year plan and under the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, another great leap forward in industry and agriculture emerged across the country, enabling us to propose such an ambitious plan for continued great leap forward in 1959 and the corresponding annual budget at this conference. Based on China's political, social, material, and technical conditions, I am full of confidence in wishing the plan a successful completion. I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and warmly suggest that the conference adopt them.

For creating the continuous victory of our country's construction, the planning and planning work of all economic departments has played a certain role, but in view of the grand scale of future construction, all those engaged in national economic development planning must go all out and try every means to catch up with the requirements of this new situation.

As a technical worker in the planning of the national power industry, please allow me to put forward some views and suggestions for improvement on this work, and please give criticisms and corrections.

First of all, I would like to introduce the process of the "Power Industry Development Plan" work in China and its main contents.

This work has a very short history in China. A few years ago, we still lacked knowledge of this major, let alone experience. Not long after the founding of the People's Republic of China, when our country rapidly completed the task of economic recovery under the leadership of the Party and began large-scale, planned economic construction, we felt the urgent need for this work, because from then on, the future power construction needed to consider issues with more foresight and more comprehensively.

In 1953, a special agency was established for the first time, and under the guidance of Soviet experts, the preparation of several "Power System Development Designs" (similar to power industry development, but with more detailed argumentation, taking a power system as the scope) was started. Later, in order to put forward comprehensive outline suggestions more promptly as a reference basis for all relevant parties and to give full play to its guiding role, this work was divided into two steps: first, to prepare a power industry development plan, and then to prepare a power system development design on this basis.

In 1956, a comprehensive power industry plan and system design were carried out, clarifying in advance the long-term construction project items and the principled key issues in the project, creating conditions for the design to catch up with the construction, and guiding the layout of pre-selected plants and pre-selected line tasks, preparing project data for last year's great leap forward.

Last year, a preliminary opinion on the national power industry fifteen-year development plan was prepared. Because it coincided with the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, the information available was not stable enough and the argumentation was not sufficient. It was only used as an internal reference for the power planning and design departments, but many pre-selected plant opinions were based on it.

In the past power industry development plans (or system development designs), the content generally includes four parts, namely (1) analysis and compilation of power load; (2) power source and high-voltage power grid planning; (3) estimation of equipment and investment; (4) problems and suggestions to be solved.

When preparing, first investigate the development intentions of the central and local national economic departments, collect relevant power resource and natural resource data, as well as population and cultivated land area data, compare with the past development speed, refer to several development ratios and laws, so as to estimate the future distribution and combination of power load, the growth rate of load and power consumption, and the level of electricity consumption reached in the predetermined year, etc. (If the national economic departments have prepared development plans, many estimation works can be avoided).

Then consider when and where to build what type and scale of power plant to meet the electricity demand, and consider building corresponding substations and transmission lines to send power to the power consumption locations, and to make necessary connections between many power plants or substations. These project items are listed in different schemes and decided through comparison.

From the above-mentioned project items, the total quantity of main equipment and materials required year by year and the required investment are roughly estimated.

Finally, from the preparation process and conclusions, the problems that construction projects will encounter in surveying, design, manufacturing, and construction are listed in the chapter of problems to be solved, and suggestions are made on how to deal with them, so as to have sufficient time to prepare and study these problems and obtain solutions in advance. At this point, the preparation of the plan comes to an end.

The principles to be followed when considering problems and comparing schemes in the preparation process are to fully reflect the national overall arrangement, ensure key points, combine large, medium and small, and coordinate hydro and thermal power, etc., considering both the objective possibility of China's material and technical conditions and the subjective initiative of the revolutionary spirit of the people, and selecting the most reasonable and feasible construction plan through scientific technical and economic argumentation.

The role of the power industry development plan (or power system development design) should be able to: provide the central and local relevant leaders with fully based and scientifically analyzed reference documents, so that they can easily consider issues and make decisions; provide the competent department with the basis for arranging the selection of plants, lines, and engineering design tasks; provide the power industry planning department with the basis for preparing the annual plan; provide the power engineering design department with the necessary basic specification data; provide the power-consuming economic departments with reference materials for formulating construction plans and plans; and propose key issues that must be resolved on schedule to the scientific research and manufacturing departments.

However, due to the limitations of the staff's professional level and work experience, the unclear resource situation, and the undetermined development plans of the power-consuming economic departments, and because the power demand in China's Great Leap Forward period is changeable, there are still many shortcomings in the past power planning work, and the finished products have not played all the roles they should have. But they have completed the historical mission and guided the arrangement of power construction projects in the past few years.

Each industrial department has its development plan, but the power industry development plan is different from other industries, it has its own characteristics. These characteristics must be paid attention to in order to effectively grasp the implementation of the power industry development plan. Now I will introduce the more prominent characteristics as follows.

First, the power industry development plan cannot be considered separately from other national economic departments. Obviously, this characteristic is determined by the task of the power industry, which must guarantee the development of all national economic departments. Taking the metallurgical industry and the textile industry as examples, the relationship between them is relatively small, and they can consider their own problems independently of each other, while the power industry has a close relationship with both of them, especially for industries with high electricity consumption. Electrolyzing one ton of aluminum requires nearly 20,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. If the two sides do not cooperate well, on the one hand, the production cost of aluminum and the guarantee of power supply will be greatly affected; on the other hand, the investment in power construction, power resources, and equipment and materials consumption will be greatly increased. Therefore, the power industry department and the smelting industry department should be closely linked from the beginning, jointly consider the problems of both sides, and come to the best overall arrangement. In addition to meeting the needs of users, the power industry department should also make reasonable suggestions to users, for example, aluminum plants should not be built in areas with tight power supply.

Second, when considering the development of the power industry, we cannot limit ourselves to the near future of one or two years. According to the current situation in China, we should consider at least five years, and if necessary, we need to make a rough estimate of the development in the next ten years. The reasons are:

1. Each large-scale power industry construction project takes a long time to survey and design, prepare equipment and materials, construct and install, and even put into production, generally two or three years or more (hydropower stations with more than one million kilowatts take about five years, and the Three Gorges Hydropower takes about ten years), and these tasks must be started separately according to the power industry development plan (or the conclusions of the power system development design).

2. Most power generation, transformation, and transmission projects in power construction will be connected into the most effective and economical large and small power systems in different periods and different ranges. Therefore, these projects are a component of the future system. Obviously, in order to make these projects meet the current requirements and occupy a correct position in the future system, we must consider the development of the next few years when preparing the development plan.

3. In order to avoid a power plant or a transmission line becoming insufficient after one or two years of completion, and without leaving room for expansion, increasing machines, adding lines, and increasing voltage, on the one hand, and to avoid using too much investment too early to build overly large projects that cannot be fully utilized for a long time, on the other hand, when formulating the construction scale and investment schedule in the development plan, we must consider the development possibilities of relevant industries in an appropriate long period of time and the corresponding electricity demand.

4. When formulating the construction scale and total installed capacity of hydropower stations, it is necessary to determine it according to the "peak load" of the power system (the prominent part of the power load when the power consumption is the highest in 24 hours of the day), and the latter is determined by the highest load of system development within a few years after the completion of the hydropower station (generally considered in five years), and the situation of all hydro and thermal power stations in the system at that time. Therefore, the preparation of the development plan must consider the possibility of power development for more than five years.

5. In order to give scientific and technological research departments and design, construction, and manufacturing departments sufficient time to study and solve key problems in construction, we must foresee the requirements in this regard in a few years, so as to propose more specific topics. This can only be done by considering long-term development in the plan.

Third, the work of power industry development planning must be carried out dialectically, because balance is only temporary and relative, and its frequency and degree of change will be more than other plans, because the scope of its impact is wider. Therefore, we should have such a mental preparation, to prepare the development plan when the basis is not sufficient and not clear enough, and then revise it in stages as the situation develops, so that it is closer to the actual situation and moves forward. This is a normal phenomenon that should be and is beyond doubt. Advanced socialist industrial countries such as the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia do this. In the process of preparation and continuous revision, they have made the development plan play a guiding role year after year.

Fourth, in the work of power industry development planning, there is a contradiction that a professional department has to consider or even pre-draft the entire national economic development plan, and a contradiction that it must be at the forefront of the construction front and avoid going deep alone and losing contact with the main force in the rear. Therefore, the initial stage of the power industry development planning work is somewhat research-oriented, and its initial finished product is somewhat similar to a research paper, which is used as a basis for soliciting opinions, establishing connections, and starting discussions. We cannot require it to be as definite as other industrial plans, and can only put forward preliminary suggestions in the name of this type. Of course, it must also have a certain reference role and guiding role.

Finally, I would like to talk about some of the difficulties encountered in the current work and opinions on solving the difficulties.

As mentioned earlier, we need to analyze and compile the load according to the electricity demand of all parties, but because the electricity-using departments have not formally considered long-term (such as the second five-year plan period) development plans, we cannot obtain the necessary information.

The power industry development plan cannot wait. We have tried to adopt another commonly used method to carry out the work, that is, to widely exchange opinions with the central and local national economic departments, and try to collect original data such as power resources and natural resources. Then, we will draw up a set of outline development plans based on the relevant development laws as the basis for preparing the power load. However, because most departments were not prepared or did not agree to discuss this issue, and the original data was incomplete and inaccurate, it could not be carried out smoothly.

The characteristics of the power industry development plan show that our work needs to go through a research and consultation stage. The preliminary finished products we put forward cannot be very mature and definite. However, it is absolutely necessary to put them forward early and conduct joint research and consultation with relevant departments or provide them for reference. However, in the past, these finished products were required to be as accurate and strictly binding as national plans or published plans, which made the work difficult to carry out.

The work of power industry development planning has not been established in China for a long time, and it still lacks a set of organizational forms and management systems that are suitable for China's situation and meet business requirements. The leadership relations at all levels are also not clear or have not been established. These situations hinder the high-speed and efficient development of the entire business.

In order to solve the above difficulties, it is recommended that:

1. All central and local electricity-using departments should invest part of their efforts to consider long-term (such as five-year) development, and contact and cooperate with the power planning department at any time, exchange opinions, and provide information to each other, so that the power industry development plan can be compiled as soon as possible for their reference. The plan formed after repeated discussions and revisions by both parties will definitely be most beneficial to both parties. These exchanged opinions and provided information should be regarded as purely business internal information, and can be approved by the responsible comrades at an appropriate level. In addition, the central and local economic departments should strengthen the exploration and investigation of resources, organize more detailed and reliable original data, and supplement and revise them regularly.

2. The preliminary finished products of the power industry development plan should be distinguished from the handling of the plans or plans approved and promulgated by the government. The former only needs to go through appropriate but not too cumbersome approval procedures to be allowed to be submitted to the relevant departments as a reference basis or as a document for starting discussions and soliciting opinions. By sending them to the relevant personnel as soon as possible, it will definitely be more effective and truly be a pioneer. The formally announced plan should be subject to stricter review, but it should not be too late.

3. The leading departments at all levels (such as the National and Local Planning Commissions) should strengthen the leadership of the power industry development planning work, establish clear leadership relationships, arrange tasks and provide support. The most urgent need is to hope that the Planning Commission, while focusing on the short-term plan, will also arrange for various economic departments to allocate some efforts to cooperate with the power planning department to consider long-term development. I believe that this simultaneous implementation of short-term and long-term goals is also in line with the principle of walking on two legs, and the effect will be great.

4. Reorganize the relevant agencies responsible for carrying out the power industry development plan (and power system development design), so that their organizational forms truly meet the work requirements, and clarify the interrelationships between these agencies, and establish a more complete work management system, so that the power planning work at the central and provincial (city, autonomous region) levels can be carried out in a planned and closely coordinated manner.

The relevant technical and economic research departments and the power planning department should conduct regular business contacts and vigorously assist in solving the specialized problems encountered in the power planning work, so as to improve the theoretical level and planning quality of applications.

The great task of socialist construction has been placed before us. The scale and complexity of the layout of future power industry construction will be unprecedented and rare in the world. If we do not seize the opportunity now and persist in doing a good job in the power industry development plan, the power construction work will inevitably be carried out without sufficient original basis, insufficient analysis and argumentation, lack of comprehensive consideration, and without full preparation.

In this way, first of all, the annual plan will be difficult to arrange reasonably, and then a series of urgent and unsolvable problems will be encountered. As a result, either the construction progress will be blocked, or the construction benefits will be greatly reduced, which will cause major losses to the country.

Therefore, I believe that the work of power industry development planning (including further system development design) must be a pioneer in order to ensure that the power industry goes first. The suggestions mentioned above are the necessary measures to ensure that the power development plan can be a pioneer. I am confident that under the correct leadership of the Party and the efforts of all working comrades, we will be able to quickly solve the difficulties and improve the work, so that the power industry can drive the entire socialist construction and leap forward under the guidance of the general line.

The recent rebellion of a small handful of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet is the most indignant to the people of all ethnic groups in the country. The rapid suppression of the rebellion is the most concerned and gratified to everyone. Now I want to report a good news to everyone from the perspective of power industry development planning.

China's water power resources are extremely rich, with a total of more than 500 million kilowatts, and one-quarter of them are in the Tibetan region. In the past, we had responded to the invitations of the autonomous governments of various fraternal ethnic groups and traveled to Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Guangxi and other regions to assist local working comrades, under the leadership of local Party and government leaders, in jointly preparing local power industry development plans. Only the power industry development plan in the Tibetan region failed to assist in the preparation due to the special circumstances there. The reactionary elements thus hindered our assistance to the Tibetan people.

When preparing the National Power Industry Fifteen-Year Development Plan proposal last year, it was also hindered by the special circumstances created by the Tibetan reactionary elements, making it difficult for us to collect sufficient original data to consider the long-term development of the region well. Now a revolutionary change is about to happen. With the establishment of a new Tibet, we must and will do our best to carry out this work, to be the pioneers of the people of all ethnic groups in the country to help build the people's paradise on the Tibetan plateau, so that the Tibetan compatriots who have suffered from the oppression and exploitation of the upper-class reactionary elements can enter socialism as soon as possible, and give play to the incomparably powerful water power resources to benefit the whole of China.

This bad thing, under the correct handling of the Party and the full support of the people of all ethnic groups, will surely turn into the greatest good thing beyond the expectations of the reactionary elements. Although a small number of reactionary elements, imperialists, Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, and foreign expansionists in Tibet are either jackals by nature or salivating, and vainly attempt to maintain cruel exploitation or inherit the privileges of aggression, all conspiracies and tricks will surely be smashed under the iron fist counterattack of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party!

    做好电力工业发展规划  保证电力工业先行
    杨定安代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    在建国后短短的几年中，由于党的正确领导和全国人民的辛勤劳动，我们的国家在第一个五年计划期中获得了空前的建设成就和国民经济发展。这些惊人的事实突出地显示了社会主义制度下计划经济的优越性和现实性。去年在第一个五年计划胜利完成的基础上和在党和毛主席的号召下，又出现了全国工农业大跃进，使得我们能在这次大会上提出如此宏伟的一九五九年继续大跃进计划和相应的年度预算，根据我国的政治、社会、物质技术条件，我满怀信心地预祝这个计划的胜利完成。我完全同意周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，热烈地建议大会予以通过。
    对于造成我国建设的连续胜利，全国各经济部门的规划和计划工作已经起了一定作用，但鉴于今后建设规模的宏伟，全体从事国民经济发展规划工作者，就必须鼓足干劲，想尽一切办法来赶上这个新形势的要求。
    作为一个国家电力工业规划的技术工作者，请允许我提出对于这个工作的一些看法和改进意见，并请予以批评指正。
    首先我想介绍一下“电力工业发展规划”工作在我国开展的经过和它的主要内容。
    这一项工作在我国的历史是很短的，几年以前我们还缺乏对这项专业的知识，更没有经验。建国后不久，当我国在党的领导下迅速完成了经济恢复任务，开始大规模、有计划的经济建设时，才感觉这个工作的迫切需要，因为从那时起，对将来的电力建设已需要更远见地和更全面地考虑问题了。
    一九五三年，第一次成立了专门机构，在苏联专家指导下，开始了若干“电力系统发展设计”（与电力工业发展类似，但论证较详，以一个电力系统为范围）的编制。后来为了更及时地提出全面轮廓性建议，作为各有关方面的参考依据及充分发挥它的指导作用，又将此工作分为两步走，先编制电力工业发展规划，然后在这个基础上编制电力系统发展设计。
    一九五六年，进行了全面的电力工业规划与系统设计，预先明确了远景建设工程项目及工程中的原则性关键问题，为设计赶上施工创造了条件，并指导了预选厂和预选线任务的布置，为去年的大跃进准备了工程项目资料。
    去年曾编制全国电力工业十五年发展规划初步意见书，因适在大跃进高潮中，所掌握的资料不够稳定，论证也不够充分，只作为电业规划设计部门的内部参考，但许多预选厂意见都据以提出。
    在过去所编的电力工业发展规划（或系统发展设计）中，其内容一般包括四个部分，即（一）电力负荷的分析与编制；（二）电源及高压电力网规划；（三）设备和投资的估计；（四）待解决的问题与建议。
    编制时首先调查中央及地方各国民经济部门的发展企图，收集有关的动力资源及自然资源资料，以及人口与耕地面积等资料，比照过去的发展速度，参考若干发展比例与规律，从而估计将来电力负荷的分布与组合，负荷、电量的增长速度，以及预定年份所达到的用电水平等等（如果各国民经济部门都编制了发展规划，则许多估计工作可以免去）。
    接着就考虑在何时何地建设什么类型及规模的发电厂来满足用电要求，并考虑建设相应的变电站和输电线，将电力送至用电地点，以及将许多电厂或变电站作必要的联结。这些工程项目都列入不同的方案，通过比较来决定。
    从上面拟订的各项工程项目中，再轮廓地估算出逐年所需用的主要器材设备总数量以及所需的投资。
    最后从编制的过程与结论中，将建设工程项目在勘测、设计、制造及施工中会遇到的问题列入待解决的问题一章内，并建议如何处理，以期能对这些问题有充分的时间来准备与研究，事先获得解决。至此，规划的编制告一段落。
    编制中考虑问题和比较方案时应遵循的原则，是充分体现国家全面安排、保证重点、大中小并举、水火电配合等方针政策，既考虑我国物质技术条件的客观可能性，又考虑人民群众革命干劲的主观能动性，通过科学的技术经济论证来选定最合理的、切实可行的建设方案。
    电力工业发展规划（或电力系统发展设计）的作用是应该能做到：向中央及地方有关领导提供有充分根据及经过科学分析的参考文件，以便他们易于考虑问题，作出决定；向主管部门提供布置选厂、选线和工程设计任务的依据；向电力工业计划部门提供编制年度计划的依据；向电业工程设计部门提供必需的基本规范数据；向用电的经济部门提供他们制订建设规划及计划的参考资料；及向科研和制造部门提出必须按期解决的关键问题。
    但是，由于工作人员的业务水平和工作经验还受到限制，资源情况不清和用电经济部门的发展规划未定，加以我国大跃进期中的用电要求多变，在过去的电力规划编制工作中还存在许多缺点，所出的成品未能起全部应有作用。但它们已经完成了历史任务，指导了几年来电力建设工程项目的安排。
    各个工业部门都有它的发展规划，但电力工业发展规划与其他工业不同，它具有自己的特点。必须注意这些特点才能有效地掌握电力工业发展规划的进行。现在将比较突出的特点介绍如下。
    第一，电力工业发展规划不能离开其他国民经济部门而单独考虑。很明显，这个特点是由电力工业的任务所规定的，它必须保证各个国民经济部门的发展。以冶金工业与纺织工业为例，它们之间的关系就比较小，它们可以彼此独立地考虑自己的问题，而电力工业就与它们都有密切关系，特别是对于耗电大的工业。电解一吨铝要用近两万度电，如果两方面配合得不好，一方面，铝的生产成本和电力供应的保证都要受很大影响；另一方面，电力建设的投资、动力资源及设备器材的消耗都会大大增加。因此电力工业部门与冶炼工业部门一开始就应密切联系，共同考虑双方面的问题，得出最好的整体安排。电力工业部门除满足用户的需要外，还应向用户提出合理建议，例如电源紧张地区就不应建设铝厂。
    第二，考虑电力工业的发展时，不能局限于近期一至二年。按照中国目前情况，至少要考虑五年，必要时也需对今后十年的发展作一概略估计，理由是：
    1、每个较大的电力工业建设项目在勘测设计，器材备置，建筑安装，以至投入生产的过程中，所需的时间颇长，一般要两三年或更多（一百万瓩以上的水电站需时五年左右，三峡水电需时十年左右），而这些工作都要根据电力工业发展规划（或电力系统发展设计的结论）来分别开始。
    2、电力工业建设中的大多数发、变、输电项目，都将在不同时期和不同范围内联成最有效和最经济的大小电力系统，因此这些项目都是未来系统中的一个组成部分。很明显，为了使这些项目既满足目前的要求又在将来系统中居于正确地位，就必须在编制发展规划时结合今后几年的发展来考虑。
    3、为了一方面避免一个发电厂或一条输电线路建成一两年后就不够用，而且没有留出扩建、增机、添线和升高电压等余地，另一方面避免过早地用过多的投资，来建设在长时期内还不能充分利用的过大工程，在发展规划中制定建设规模和投入进度时，必须考虑有关工业在适当长的时期内的发展可能和相应的用电要求。
    4、拟定水电站的建设规模和装机总容量时，必需根据电力系统的“尖峰负荷”（每日二十四小时中用电最多时，电力负荷的突出部分）来决定，而后者又决定于该水电站建成后几年内（一般按五年考虑）系统发展的最高负荷，及当时系统内所有水火电站的情况。因此，编制发展规划必须考虑五年以上的用电发展可能。
    5、为了使科学技术研究部门和设计、施工、制造部门有充分的时间来研究解决建设中的关键问题，必须预见到若干年以后在这方面的要求，从而提出比较具体的课题。这也只能在规划中考虑远景发展才能办到。
    第三，电力工业发展规划工作必需辩证地进行，因为平衡只是暂时的和相对的，而且它的变化频率和程度，将较其他规划为多，因为对它发生影响的面是较广的。因此我们应该有这样的思想准备，在根据尚不太充分和不太明确的时候，就进行编制发展规划，然后随着情况的发展，分期修订，使它一次比一次更接近实际并向前迈进。这是应有的正常现象而无可怀疑的。先进的社会主义工业国家如苏联和捷克斯洛伐克，都是这样做的。他们就在编制和不断修订的过程中，使发展规划年复一年地起了指导作用。
    第四，在电力工业发展规划的工作中，存在着以一个专业部门要考虑甚至预拟整个国民经济发展规划的矛盾，和既要走在建设战线的最前线又要避免孤军深入失去与后方主力联系的矛盾。因此电力工业发展规划工作的初步阶段是有点属于研究性的，它的最初成品是有点近于研究论文，用以作为广征意见，建立联系和展开讨论的基础的。我们不能要求它像其他工业规划那样肯定，只能以初步建议书这类的名义提出。当然它也必须具有一定的参考作用和指导作用。
    最后我想谈一谈目前工作中遇到的一些困难和解决困难的意见。
    前面说过，我们要根据各方面的用电要求来分析和编制负荷，但由于各用电部门尚未正式考虑远景（例如第二个五年计划时期）发展规划，我们得不到必需的资料。
    电力工业发展规划是不能等待的，我们曾试图采取另一种常用的方法来进行工作，即广泛地与中央及地方各国民经济部门交换意见，尽量收集动力资源与自然资源等原始资料，然后由我们根据有关的发展规律来拟出一套轮廓性发展规划，作为编制电力负荷的依据。但因各部门多未准备或不同意讨论这个问题，及原始资料的不全不实，也未能顺利进行。
    电力工业发展规划的特点，说明我们的工作是要经过一个研究商讨阶段的，我们提出的初步成品不可能是很成熟肯定的，不过早提出来和有关部门共同研究商讨或供他们参考是绝对必要的。但因过去曾要求这些成品像国家计划或公布的规划那样准确和具备严格拘束性，以致工作难于开展。
    电力工业发展规划工作在我国建立不久，还缺乏一套适合我国情况及满足业务要求的组织形式和管理制度。各级的领导关系也还欠明确或没有建立起来。这些情况妨碍了整个业务的高速和高效开展。
    为了解决上述困难，建议：
    1、所有中央和地方的用电部门都投入一部分力量来考虑远景（例如五年）发展，随时与电力规划部门联系合作，交换意见，相互提供资料，使电力工业发展规划能尽早编成，供他们参考。这样经双方反复讨论修正而成的规划，必是对双方都最有利的。这些交换的意见和提供的资料，应看作是纯业务性的内部资料，只要经过适当一级的负责同志审定就可以了。此外，中央及地方经济部门，应加强对资源的勘探调查，整理出较详明可靠的原始资料，并定期补充修订。
    2、处理电力工业发展规划的初步成品，与处理政府审定公布的规划或计划，应加以区别。前者只要经过适当的、但不太繁琐的审批手续，就准许提交各有关部门，作为参考依据，或作为据以展开讨论、征求意见的文件。这样把它们尽快地送到有关人员的手中，必定更能发挥时效，真正做起尖兵。正式公布的规划要经较严格的审核，但亦不宜过迟。
    3、各级领导部门（如国家及地方计委）加强对电力工业发展规划工作的领导，建立明确的领导关系，布置任务及给予支持。最迫切需要的是希望计委在抓近期计划的同时，也布置各经济部门分出一点力量，配合电力规划部门，考虑远景发展。相信这样近期与远景同时并举，也是符合两条腿走路的方针，收效必极大。
    4、整理负责进行电力工业发展规划（及电力系统发展设计）的有关机构，使它们的组织形式切实符合工作要求，并明确这些机构的相互关系，建立一套较完整的工作管理制度，使中央和省（市、自治区）两级的电力规划工作，能有计划地密切配合进行。
    各有关的技术经济研究部门与电力规划部门，经常进行业务联系，大力协助解决电力规划工作中所遇到的专门问题，以提高应用的理论水平和规划质量。
    伟大的社会主义建设任务已经摆在我们的面前。将来电力工业建设规模的庞大和布局的错综复杂，将是史无前例，世所少见的。如果现在不抓紧时机，坚持不懈地做好电力工业发展规划，则电力建设工作势必在原始根据不足，分析论证不够，缺少全面考虑和未经充分准备的情况下进行。
    这样，首先将使年度计划难以合理安排，随着将遇到一系列急切无法解决的问题。结果，不是建设进度受阻，就会是建设效益大大减低，这都会造成国家的重大损失。
    因此我认为电力工业发展规划工作（包括进一步地系统发展设计）必须作先行的尖兵，才能保证电力工业先行。前面所提的建议就是保证电力发展规划能够作尖兵的必要措施。我确信在党的正确领导和全体工作同志的努力下，必能迅速解决困难，改进工作，使电力工业带动整个社会主义建设，遵着总路线的指引，飞跃前进。
    最近西藏一小撮上层反动分子叛乱的事件，是全国各族人民所最愤慨的，叛乱的被迅速平息，是大家所最关心和欣慰的。我现在要从电力工业发展规划的角度上来向大家报一个喜讯。
    我国水力资源是极丰富的，共有五亿多瓩，而其中四分之一在西藏地区。过去我们曾应各兄弟民族自治政府的邀约，遍至新疆、内蒙古，青海及广西等地区，协助当地工作同志，在地方党政领导下，共同编制地方的电力工业发展规划。只有西藏地区的电力工业发展规划因那里的情况特殊，未能去协助编制，反动分子就这样妨害了我们对藏族人民的帮助。
    去年编制全国电力工业十五年发展规划建议书时，也受阻于西藏反动分子所造成的特殊情况，使我们难于收集足够的原始资料来很好地考虑该地区的远景发展。现在一个划时代的变化要发生了，随着新西藏的建立，我们一定要，也有可能尽最大努力来进行这方面的工作，担任全国各族人民帮助建设西藏高原上人民乐园的尖兵，使饱受上层反动分子压迫剥削的藏族同胞早日进入社会主义，并且发挥那威力无比的水力资源，为全中国造福。
    这件坏事在党的正确处理和各族人民的全力支持下，一定会出于反动分子意料以外，变为最大的好事。西藏少数反动分子、帝国主义者、蒋匪帮和外国扩张主义者，虽然或者豺狼成性，或者馋涎欲滴，妄图保持残酷剥削或承继侵掠特权，但在党领导的全中国人民的铁拳反击下，一切阴谋诡计，必定粉碎无遗！
