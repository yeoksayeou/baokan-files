Produce the Six Major Equipments More, Faster, Better and More Economically
Ministry of Machine Building Holds Broadcast Conference Today

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The First Ministry of Machine Building and the Central People's Broadcasting Station have jointly decided to hold a national broadcast conference at 2:00 PM on the 16th of this month, regarding the socialist competition among mechanical industry workers to complete the Six Major Equipments more, faster, better, and more economically. At that time, millions of mechanical industry workers across the country will participate in this conference and challenge each other, launching a socialist competition.

According to the inspection by the First Ministry of Machine Building, the production of the Six Major Equipments in the first quarter has been increasing month by month. Especially in March, due to the earnest implementation of the policy of concentrating forces and ensuring key points in various regions, and the better development of mass movements centered on technological revolution and aimed at completing the production tasks of the Six Major Equipments in various enterprises, the manufacturing of the Six Major Equipments achieved greater results than in January and February. For example, Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant, Shenyang No. 53 Factory and other factories and mining enterprises have overfulfilled their first quarter plans. The production of irrigation and drainage machinery has also made great progress in various regions. For example, Hebei Province produced more than 130,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage power machinery in the first quarter, overfulfilling the first quarter plan, and increasing the output of irrigation and drainage machinery by four times compared to the first quarter of last year.

The person in charge of the First Ministry of Machine Building believes that although these achievements have been made in the first quarter, there is still a large gap compared with the country's urgent need for the Six Major Equipments, and more efforts are needed from the broad masses of workers.

　　多快好省制造六大设备
　　一机部今天召开广播大会
    据新华社15日讯　第一机械工业部和中央人民广播电台，共同决定在本月16日下午二时，联合举办全国机械工业职工多、快、好、省地完成六大设备竞赛广播大会。届时全国几百万机械工业的职工都将参加这个大会，并将在会上互相挑战，展开社会主义竞赛。
    根据第一机械工业部的检查，第一季度六大设备的生产是逐月上升的。特别在3月份，由于各地认真地贯彻执行了集中力量、保证重点的方针，在各个企业中更好地开展了以技术革命为中心内容、以完成六大设备生产任务为目标的群众运动，六大设备的制造，比1、2月份取得了更大的成绩。如沈阳矿山机器厂、沈阳五三工厂等厂矿企业都超额完成了一季度计划。各地排灌机械的生产也有很大进展。如河北省第一季度共生产了十三万多马力的排灌动力机械，超额完成了第一季度的计划，比去年第一季度排灌机械的产量提高了四倍。
    第一机械工业部的负责人认为：虽然第一季度取得了这些成绩，但和国家当前对六大设备的迫切需要相比，还有很大距离，还需要广大职工作更大的努力。
