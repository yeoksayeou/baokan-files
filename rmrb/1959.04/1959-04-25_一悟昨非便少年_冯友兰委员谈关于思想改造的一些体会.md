Chairman, fellow members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Report on the Work of the Government and the reports of all the leading comrades.

Before this meeting, I made an inspection tour of the Northeast. The situation in the localities is exactly as described in Premier Zhou's report. In 1958, there was a great leap forward in every aspect, and in 1959 there will be an even greater leap forward. There are difficulties in the leap forward, but the leading comrades and the broad masses of workers and staff we contacted in the Northeast all have the confidence and the means to overcome these difficulties. Judging from the tasks completed in the first quarter of this year, the difficulties can certainly be overcome, and the annual tasks can certainly be fulfilled and overfulfilled.

The Party is the soul of all undertakings, the motive force of all motive forces. Before 1958, I did not have a sufficient understanding of this fundamental fact; I even had some resistance to the Party's leadership in academic and educational fields.

The main reasons why we were able to achieve a great leap forward are the Party's leadership, the mass movement, and technical reform. The Party's leadership determined the direction and clarified the tasks. The masses were mobilized to take on the tasks, and technical reform was used to complete and overfulfill the tasks.

Ultimately, all reasons come down to the Party's leadership. It is the Party that determined our direction and general task of building socialism, as well as all the specific tasks for building socialism. It is the Party that mobilized the masses, and it is the Party that encouraged and promoted technical reform. The Party is the soul of all undertakings, the motive force of all motive forces.

However, before 1958, I did not have a sufficient understanding of this fundamental fact. I even had some resistance to the Party's leadership in academic and educational fields. Although I did not openly say, "Laymen cannot lead experts," I had this kind of thinking.

Of course, this is an extremely wrong idea. In terms of philosophy and social sciences, this kind of thinking is still a matter of standpoint. Our philosophy is Marxism-Leninism, and our social science is Marxist social science. In this respect, who is more expert than the Marxist Party? In the natural sciences and technology, there is still the issue of reaching and surpassing international standards. However, in philosophy and social sciences, the international standard is in the Soviet Union and China. Chairman Mao's writings and Party documents are the standards of the international level. Bourgeois intellectuals think that the Party is an amateur, which is still standing on the bourgeois standpoint, and still admitting that bourgeois philosophy and social science are "orthodox."

First, I thought that "expertise" was more important than "redness," and then I felt that "redness" was easier than "expertise," but in fact, both are wrong. Changing one's standpoint requires a transformation of the entire spirit, a true rebirth.

Regarding the issue of cultivating cadres, I originally thought that this was mainly for young cadres. Later, I realized that cultivating cadres means cultivating cadres who are both red and expert. But I also thought that "expertise" was more important than "redness," because building socialism requires knowledge and technology. Can we build socialism with just subjective loyalty? This kind of thinking is also extremely wrong. Knowledge and technology are also a kind of weapon, which can be used to build socialism or to oppose socialism. Bourgeois intellectuals, even if they have some knowledge and technology, if they cannot wholeheartedly serve the construction of socialism, their "expertise" will not only fail to give full play to its positive role, but may also become a negative factor.

Later, I felt that "redness" was easier than "expertise," because "expertise" requires long-term accumulation and learning, while "redness" is just a matter of changing one's standpoint. Isn't it easy to change one's standpoint? In the early days of liberation, some people said that changing one's standpoint and viewpoint is like a camera changing its exposure to light. If the exposure to light is not good from one angle, just change to another angle and take another shot. This is a complete misunderstanding of what it means to change one's standpoint. The great leap forward of 1958 proved that, generally speaking, "expertise" is much easier than "redness." A person's class standpoint, which has been formed over many years, is part of his entire spirit. Standpoint is not like a piece of clothing that can be taken off and changed at any time; nor is it like a sore on a person's body that can be cut off by a surgeon. Changing one's standpoint requires a transformation of the entire spirit, a true "rebirth," which is not easy.

For someone like me who has been engaged in bourgeois philosophy for a long time and has my own system, remolding requires even more effort. There is a distinction between general bourgeois ideas and bourgeois philosophical ideas, but they are also interconnected. General bourgeois ideas, in the final analysis, are a matter of world outlook, while bourgeois philosophical ideas are the concentrated and systematic expression of the bourgeois world outlook. Premier Zhou's report mentioned that the remolding of intellectuals requires "a thorough break with the bourgeois world outlook and a genuine grasp of the working class's world outlook, which will still require a relatively long period of time." This is true for general old intellectuals, and even more so for someone like me who has a bourgeois philosophical system. This does not mean that those who engaged in bourgeois philosophy in the past can use this as an excuse to delay remolding, but only that they need to make redoubled efforts.

I used to have a set of bourgeois philosophical systems. After liberation, I did not seriously criticize it. I thought that I would only engage in the history of philosophy and not in philosophy itself in the future. I thought I could just ignore my previous philosophical thoughts, but in fact, if you ignore it, it will still deal with you. It is your world outlook, and you will inevitably use it to view the world. Using it to view the world is like wearing a pair of bad glasses. What you see is a distorted world. Wearing these glasses to look at the history of philosophy will inevitably be a distorted history of philosophy.

All latent thoughts, given the right opportunity, will always emerge. During 1956 and 1957, I made some erroneous remarks on some issues in the history of Chinese philosophy. Even last year, I wanted to "set up opposing sides" to the Party's educational policy. This all proves Engels' famous saying: "To declare a philosophical idea to be wrong is not to subdue it."

"Forty Years of Retrospection": The general direction is to maintain the old, conservative, and reactionary things. After my initial self-criticism, my ideological and theoretical level has improved somewhat, restoring my confidence and increasing my courage to move forward. This year is the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. I took this opportunity to make a more comprehensive and preliminary examination of my philosophical writings over the past forty years since the "May Fourth" Movement. I wrote an article entitled "Forty Years of Retrospection."

During these forty years, I have written a lot of things around different issues in different periods. Among them, there is a general direction, that is, to maintain the old, conservative, and reactionary things, and to oppose the new, progressive, and revolutionary things. After the "May Fourth" Movement, my early writings mainly discussed the issue of Eastern and Western cultures. My views on this issue were basically similar to those of Mr. Liang Shuming. Later, I discussed the issue of outlook on life. At that time, I thought I was opposing the mysticism of Zhang Junmai and others, but in fact, I was reserving a place for mysticism, trying to make science coexist peacefully with it. Later, I used the viewpoint and method of bourgeois philosophical history to write the history of Chinese philosophy, propagating idealism in the history of Chinese philosophy and criticizing materialism. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I wrote several books such as "New Rational Learning," which was opposed to Marxism and served the reactionary ruling class and its regime at that time. After liberation, for nearly ten years, I still made the erroneous remarks mentioned above. In this forty-year great revolutionary era, I represented a countercurrent in the Chinese philosophical circles.

Some people are unwilling to criticize their past thoughts. They are afraid that after criticism, they will feel empty. I originally had such concerns. In fact, destruction and construction are interconnected. To destroy bourgeois philosophical ideas is also to establish Marxism to some extent. After initially criticizing forty years of idealist philosophical thoughts, I felt that my ideological level and theoretical level had also improved at the same time. This restored my confidence and increased my courage. Not only did I not feel empty, but I only felt that in the era of the great leap forward, I should strive to go upstream and forge ahead bravely.

Now is an era of poetry. When I finished writing "Forty Years of Retrospection," I wrote four poems:

I wrote with conviction at the time, meticulously searching for the roots one by one.
The past is unbearable to recall, a countercurrent for forty years.

Marxism-Leninism shines brightly like the Big Dipper, sweeping away obscene words like smoke.
Do not worry about old age in this enlightened time, a single realization of yesterday's errors makes one young again.

Red flags are brilliant, and the east wind is strong. The beautiful name of Yu Region has been preserved since ancient times.
The red land has indeed become a red land, and the divine land is truly a divine land.

One day is like twenty years, and satellites go straight up to the ninth heaven.
Riding the wind with infinite flying intentions, quickly pack lightly and catch up first.

### “一悟昨非便少年”  冯友兰委员谈关于思想改造的一些体会

专栏：

    “一悟昨非便少年”
    冯友兰委员谈关于思想改造的一些体会主席，诸位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和各位首长的报告。
    在开会以前，我到东北视察一次。地方上的情况，完全是像周总理的报告中所说的，一九五八年无论在那一方面，都有一个大跃进，一九五九年将有更大的跃进。跃进中是有困难的，但是我们在东北所接触到的各单位的领导同志和广大职工，都有信心，有办法，克服困难。就本年第一季度完成的任务看，困难是一定能够克服，全年任务一定能够完成和超额完成。
    党是一切事业的灵魂，党是一切动力的动力。这个基本事实，我在一九五八年以前是认识不够的；对于在学术教育方面的党的领导，甚至还有些抵触
    我们所以能够大跃进的原因，主要的是党的领导，群众运动和技术改革。党的领导确定了方向，明确了任务。群众发动了，把任务担负起来，以技术改革，完成和超额完成任务。
    一切的原因，推到最后，还是归结到党的领导。是党确定了我们建设社会主义的方向和总任务，以及一切为了建设社会主义的具体任务。是党发动了群众，是党鼓励和推动技术改革。党是一切事业的灵魂，党是一切动力的动力。
    可是，对于这个基本事实，我在一九五八年以前是认识不够的。对于在学术教育方面的党的领导，甚至还有一些抵触。我虽然没有公开地说“外行不能领导内行”，但是这种思想是有的。
    当然这是一种极端错误的思想。就哲学和社会科学说，这种思想还是立场问题。我们的哲学就是马克思列宁主义，我们的社会科学是马克思主义的社会科学。在这一方面，有谁能比马克思主义的党还内行？在自然科学和技术方面，还有达到和超过国际水平的问题。可是，在哲学和社会科学方面，国际水平就在苏联和中国。毛主席的著作和党的文件就是国际水平的标准。资产阶级知识分子认为党是外行；还是站在资产阶级立场，仍然承认资产阶级哲学和社会科学是“正统”。
    先认为“专”比“红”重要，后又觉得“红”比“专”容易，其实都是错误的。改变立场需要整个精神的转变，真正脱胎换骨
    对于培养干部的问题，我原来认为这主要的是对于青年干部而言。后来认识到培养干部是要培养又红又专的干部。但是我又认为“专”比“红”重要，因为建设社会主义总要靠知识和技术，只靠主观上的赤胆忠心就能建设社会主义吗？这种思想也是极端错误的。知识技术也是一种武器，可以用来建设社会主义，也可以用来反对社会主义。资产阶级知识分子，即使其有一点知识技术，但是如果不能真心为建设社会主义服务，他的“专”不但不能充分发挥积极作用，还可能成为一个消极的因素。
    后来我又觉得“红”比“专”容易，因为“专”需要长期积累学习，而“红”不过是改变立场的问题。立场改变还不是说改就改？在解放初期有人说，改变立场和观点，不过是像照像机改变对光一样。从一个角度上对光不好，换一个角度，另对一次就行了。这是完全不了解改变立场是怎么一回事。一九五八年的大跃进证明，一般地说，“专”比“红”容易得多。一个人的多年来的阶级立场，是他的整个精神的一部分。立场并不是像一件衣服，可以随时脱下来，换一换；也不是像人身上某一部分长了个疮，可以请外科医生割一割。改变立场需要一个整个精神的转变，真正是“脱胎换骨”，不是容易的事情。
    像我这样长期搞资产阶级哲学而且自己有一套体系的人，改造就需要更加努力。一般的资产阶级思想和资产阶级哲学思想是有所区别，而又互相联系的。一般的资产阶级思想，归根结底，还是个世界观的问题，而资产阶级哲学思想，就是资产阶级世界观的集中的系统的表现。总理的报告提到，知识分子改造要“彻底地同资产阶级的世界观决裂，真正掌握工人阶级的世界观，那还需要一个较长的时期。”这对于一般的旧知识分子说是如此，对于像我这样有一个资产阶级哲学体系的人就更是如此了。这并不是说，过去搞资产阶级哲学的人可以以此为借口，拖延改造，只是说，需要加倍努力。
    我过去有一套资产阶级哲学体系，解放以后，我对它并没有认真地进行批判，我想，以后我只搞哲学史不搞哲学了。以前的哲学思想，不理它就算了，其实你不理它，它可是要理你。它是你的世界观，你必然要用它来观世界。用它来观世界，就好像戴一副坏眼镜一样，所看到的，是一种被歪曲的世界，戴着这副眼镜看哲学史，也必然是一个歪曲的哲学史。
    一切潜伏的思想，遇有相当的时机，总是要冒出来的。一九五六年、一九五七年间，我对于中国哲学史中一些问题，发表了些错误的言论。即在去年，对于党的教育方针，也要“树立对立面”。这都证明恩格斯的一句名言：“宣布一个哲学思想是错误的，并不等于制服它。”
    “四十年的回顾”：总的方向是维护旧的，保守的，反动的东西。自己初步批判后，思想和理论水平都提高了一些，恢复了信心，增加了前进的勇气今年是“五四”运动的四十周年，我乘此机会，把我从“五四”以来，四十年间在哲学方面的写作，作了一个比较全面的初步检查。写了一篇文章，名为“四十年的回顾”。
    在这四十年间，我在不同的时期，围绕着不同的问题，写了不少的东西，其中有一个总的方向，那就是维护旧的，保守的，反动的东西，反对新的，进步的，革命的东西。在“五四”以后，我的早期的写作，主要的是谈东西文化问题。我对于这个问题的见解，基本上跟梁漱溟先生差不多。以后我谈人生观的问题。我在当时自以为是反对张君劢等人的神秘主义，其实是给神秘主义保留一个地盘，企图使科学同它和平共处。以后我就用资产阶级哲学史的观点和方法写中国哲学史，宣传中国哲学史中的唯心主义，批评唯物主义。在抗战期间，我又写“新理学”等几本书，与马克思主义对立，为当时的反动的统治阶级及其政权服务。解放以后，将及十年之久，我还发出如上面所说的错误的言论。在这四十年伟大的革命时代，我代表了中国哲学界中的一股逆流。
    有些人不愿意批判自己过去的思想。怕的是批判以后，感觉到空虚。我原来也有这样的恐虑。其实破与立是互相联系的。对于资产阶级哲学思想有所破，也就是对于马克思主义有所立。在初步批判四十年的唯心主义哲学思想以后，我觉得自己的思想水平和理论水平，也同时提高了一些。这就恢复了信心，增加了勇气。不但不感觉到空虚，只觉得要在大跃进的时代，力争上游，奋勇前进。
    现在是一个诗歌的时代，在写完“四十年的回顾”的时候，我写了四首诗：
    奋笔当时信有由，根源一一细搜求。
    不堪往事重回顾，四十年间作逆流。
    马列道高北斗悬，淫辞一扫散如烟。
    明时不虑老将至，一悟昨非便少年。
    红旗灿烂东风遒，禹域嘉名自古留。
    赤县果然成赤县，神州真个是神州。
    一日便如二十年，卫星直上九重天。
    乘风无限飞腾意，急取轻装快赶先。
