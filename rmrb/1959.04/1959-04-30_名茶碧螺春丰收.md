Famous Biluochun Tea Has a Bumper Harvest

(Our report) The Biluochun famous tea in Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province, which is known for its fine and tender downy hair, clear color and fresh taste, has been fully harvested. By April 16, the county had picked more than 14,000 jin of Biluochun tea and more than 1,600 jin of high-grade fried green tea, greatly exceeding the output of the same period last year.

Every day at dawn, hundreds of tea-picking girls all over the mountains, carrying tea-picking baskets and singing melodious tea-picking mountain songs, begin their day's work. At dusk, the fragrance of tea frying wafts everywhere, refreshing the heart, this is the signal of the tea-making heroes, and the tea farmers work diligently from morning to night to increase the production of famous tea.

Dongting Commune in Dongshan, which is famous for its high Biluochun picking and manufacturing technology and good product quality, has proposed six picking and six not picking measures, and three concentration measures to ensure the quality of tea. The six picking and six not picking are: pick tea but not stems, pick big but not small, pick thriving but not thin, pick outside but not inside, pick near but not far, and pick the middle but not the top and bottom. The three concentration measures are: concentrated sorting, concentrated production, and concentrated stoves. This ensures that the buds and leaves that should be picked are picked in time without damaging the tea trees, ensuring the quality of the green leaves.

    名茶碧螺春丰收
    本报讯　以细嫩多毫、色清味鲜著称的江苏震泽县碧螺春名茶，已全面开采。到4月16日，全县已采摘碧螺春茶一万四千多斤，高级炒青绿茶一千六百多斤，大大超过了去年同期产量。
    每天黎明，满山遍坞成百上千的采茶姑娘，手提采茶篮，唱着悦耳的采茶山歌，开始了她们一天的劳动。在黄昏时分，到处飘来一阵阵炒茶清香，沁人心田，这是制茶英雄们的信号，茶农们就这样从早到晚，辛勤的劳动，增产名茶。
    素以碧螺春采制技术较高，产品质量较好著名的东山洞庭公社，提出六采六不采和三集中的措施，以保证茶的质量。六采六不采就是：采茶不采梗，采大不采小，采兴不采细，采外不采里，采近不采远，采中间不采上下。三集中就是：集中拣，集中制，集中锅灶。从而既使应采的芽叶及时采下，又不损伤茶树，保证青叶质量。
