　　The Fraternal Friendship between the Mongolian and Hungarian People
　　By Our Correspondent Feng Ye
　　After several caresses of the spring breeze, the Mongolian land awakens from the depths of winter. The accumulated snow on the mountains around Ulaanbaatar has melted, and the thick ice blocks in the Tuul River have been washed away by the torrent, the river water is clear. The citizens of Ulaanbaatar have taken off their fur robes and put on spring clothes, welcoming the new production and construction tasks of 1959.

　　It was in this beautiful spring scenery that the envoys of the Hungarian people—the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation, led by Munnich Ferenc, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government—arrived in Ulaanbaatar from faraway Budapest. The Mongolian people warmly welcomed the guests who arrived in the spring.

　　April 13th was an unforgettable day. Tens of thousands of citizens, dressed in festive new clothes, lined the streets to welcome the representatives of the fraternal Hungarian people. The several streets the delegation passed through were filled with crowds waving colorful flags and paper flowers, shouting welcoming slogans, making the capital a particularly lively and exciting scene since the beginning of spring.

　　When Prime Minister Munnich spoke to the welcoming crowd for the first time after getting off the plane, he emphasized the fraternal friendship between socialist countries and the growing fraternal friendship between the Hungarian and Mongolian people. He said that the Hungarian people would never forget the great assistance the Mongolian people gave them after the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in 1956.

　　We remember clearly that after the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government quelled the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Mongolian government sent a telegram to the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government on November 6, 1956, congratulating them, and at the same time decided to provide the Hungarian people with two thousand tons of wheat, as well as meat and sausages, free of charge. This was fraternal assistance, filled with fraternal friendship.

　　Two years ago, a Mongolian government delegation visited Budapest. In the past two years, both Mongolia and Hungary have made rapid progress in socialist construction. The economic and cultural cooperation between the Mongolian and Hungarian people has also developed rapidly in recent years. The trade volume between Mongolia and Hungary is gradually developing, and the exchange volume between the two countries in 1958-1959 has doubled compared with 1957. Mongolian cashmere, leather and other animal products are exported to Hungary, and Hungarian medical equipment and daily necessities have arrived in Mongolia, all of which are welcomed by the people. In order to help Mongolia build water conservancy projects in pastoral areas, Hungarian water conservancy technicians are carrying out well-drilling work in the southern Gobi region of Mongolia to meet the needs of livestock drinking water in the Gobi. The cultural cooperation between Mongolia and Hungary is constantly developing, and the two countries have signed an agreement on cultural, scientific and technological cooperation. The ties in science, health, sports and other aspects are also becoming more and more extensive.

　　The Hungarian Party and Government Delegation came to Mongolia at a time when the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries are developing day by day. There is no doubt that this friendly visit will further promote the development of friendship between the two peoples.

　　In the past five days, the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation has had extensive contact with Mongolian workers, peasants and students. Everywhere they went, they received warm and cordial reception and welcome.

　　On April 15, Prime Minister Munnich and his entourage, accompanied by Chairman Tsedenbal and others, visited the Mongolian Industrial United Factory. The factory is undergoing large-scale construction, with a new leather factory, a woolen textile factory, and the expansion of some factory buildings. The Hungarian guests visited the soft sheepskin and other products produced by the factory workers with great interest, and then visited the construction site of the leather factory and the woolen textile factory. The factory director introduced to the guests that the leather factory, built with the help of Czechoslovakia, is progressing smoothly.

　　Prime Minister Munnich and others came to the woolen textile factory and visited the workshop where machines were being installed. The production process of this textile factory, which can produce more than one million meters of products annually, is fully automated. Engineer Avermid introduced to the Hungarian guests that this factory was aided by China and will be put into production this year.

　　The Hungarian guests also visited a pasture. Hundreds of male and female members of the "Dawn" cooperative lined up to welcome the guests. The members also held a small friendly gathering to commemorate this rare meeting. The red entertainment room was packed, young members, children, and the elderly all came, filling the entire room.

　　At the meeting, the chairman of the cooperative, Damdin, announced that in order to permanently commemorate the friendship between the Mongolian and Hungarian people, the members of the cooperative decided to rename the "Dawn" cooperative as the "Mongolian-Hungarian Friendship Cooperative." The whole audience burst into warm applause, welcoming this meaningful decision.

　　The Hungarian guests extended warm congratulations when they heard the introduction that the cooperative had completed its 1958 production plan, would increase more livestock this year, increase the output of animal products, and increase the income of its members.

　　Kish, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, expressed his gratitude for the friendly decision of this friendly cooperative with more than 42,000 livestock and 1,272 members. He said that Hungarian farmers, like Mongolian herders, are also taking the road of collectivization. Although the Mongolian and Hungarian people are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, the common goal of building communism closely connects the people together. The children of the cooperative performed national songs and dances for the guests. The friendship between the Mongolian and Hungarian people permeated the Mongolian grasslands in the spring.

　　After friendly talks between the Mongolian and Hungarian Party and Government Delegations, Tsedenbal and Munnich signed the joint communiqué on the 17th. As Tsedenbal said at the Mongolian-Hungarian friendship rally held in Ulaanbaatar, both sides of the talks pointed out with satisfaction that the friendship between the two peoples is increasing and developing day by day. Both sides reached a complete consensus on their views on the international situation. They expressed their support for the struggles of people striving for national independence and condemned the imperialist aggressive policies of creating tension. Hungary's decision to provide loans to Mongolia to help develop Mongolia's agricultural and pastoral construction once again demonstrated the fraternal friendship of mutual assistance based on the principles of proletarian internationalism.

　　During their short five-day visit, the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation further established a deep friendship with the Mongolian people. They bid farewell to Ulaanbaatar with the deep friendship of the Mongolian people. Then they continued their friendly visits to the three fraternal countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea.

　　蒙匈人民的兄弟友谊
　　本报记者　逢烨
    春风几番掠过，蒙古大地从隆冬里苏醒。乌兰巴托四周山上的积雪已经融化，土拉河中的厚冰块也已被激流冲走，河水清澈。乌兰巴托市民脱下皮袍，换上春装，迎接着1959年的新的生产建设任务。
    就在这大好春光里，匈牙利人民的使者——匈牙利党政代表团，由匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、匈牙利工农革命政府总理明尼赫率领，从遥远的布达佩斯来到了乌兰巴托。蒙古人民热情地欢迎在春天来到的客人。
    4月13日，是一个难忘的日子，几万市民穿着节日的新装，夹道欢迎兄弟的匈牙利人民的代表。代表团经过的几条大街，站满了人群，他们挥舞着彩旗、纸花，高呼着欢迎的口号，使首都充满了入春以来的特别热闹、兴奋的景象。
    明尼赫总理下飞机后，第一次向欢迎的人群讲话时，就着重谈到了社会主义国家间的兄弟友谊，谈到匈、蒙两国人民日益发展着的兄弟友谊。他说，匈牙利人民永不会忘记，在1956年匈牙利发生反革命叛乱事件后，蒙古人民曾经给予他们大力的援助。
    我们记得很清楚，当匈牙利工农革命政府平息了反革命的叛乱后，蒙古政府曾在1956年11月6日打电报向匈牙利工农革命政府祝贺，同时并决定无偿地援助匈牙利人民两千吨小麦，以及肉和香肠。这是兄弟的援助，充满了兄弟的友情。
    两年以前，蒙古政府代表团曾经访问了布达佩斯。两年来，蒙古和匈牙利在社会主义建设中都有了很快的发展。蒙匈两国人民的经济、文化合作，最近几年来发展也很快。蒙匈两国的贸易额正逐步发展，1958—1959年两国的换货额比1957年增加两倍。蒙古的绒毛、皮革等畜产品输往匈牙利，匈牙利的医药器材和日用品来到了蒙古，都受到人民的欢迎。为了帮助蒙古兴修牧区水利，匈牙利的水利技术人员，在蒙古的南部戈壁地区，进行打井工作，以满足戈壁牲畜饮水的需要。蒙匈两国文化合作不断发展，两国曾签定了文化科学技术合作协定。在科学、卫生、体育等方面的联系也越来越加广泛了。
    匈牙利党政代表团就是在两国友好合作关系日益发展的时候来到蒙古的。通过这次友好访问，毫无疑问，将更进一步促进两国人民的友谊的发展。
    匈牙利党政代表团五天来和蒙古的工人、农民和学生进行了广泛的接触。到处受到热情的、亲切的接待和欢迎。
    4月15日，明尼赫总理等一行由泽登巴尔主席等陪同，来到蒙古工业联合工厂参观。这个工厂正在大兴土木，新建皮革厂、毛纺织厂和扩建一些厂房。匈牙利客人们很有兴趣地参观了工厂工人生产的软羊皮及其他产品，然后又参观了皮革厂和毛纺织厂的建设工地，厂长向客人们介绍说，在捷克斯洛伐克帮助下兴建的皮革厂，工程进展很顺利。
    明尼赫总理等来到毛纺织厂，参观正在进行安装机器的车间。这个每年可产一百万公尺以上产品的纺织厂，生产过程全部是自动化的。工程师阿维尔米德向匈牙利客人介绍这个工厂是中国援助的，今年就要投入生产。
    匈牙利客人又到牧场访问。“曙光”合作社的成百的男女社员们列队迎接客人。社员们还举行了一个小型的友好集会，纪念这次难得的会见。红色娱乐室里座无虚席，年青的社员，孩子、老人都来了，整个屋子挤得满满的。
    社长达木丁在会上宣布说，社员同志们为了永久纪念蒙匈人民的友谊，决定把“曙光”合作社改名为“蒙匈友好合作社”。全场报以热烈的掌声，欢迎这个有意义的决定。
    匈牙利客人们听到合作社完成1958年的生产计划，今年将要增殖更多的牲畜，提高畜产品产量和增加社员的收入的介绍时，致以热烈的祝贺。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员基什，对这个拥有四万二千多头牲畜，一千二百七十二名社员的友好合作社的友好的决定，表示感谢。他说，匈牙利的农民，也像蒙古牧民一样，正在走合作化的道路。蒙匈两国人民虽然隔着千山万水，但是建设共产主义的共同目标把人民紧紧地连在一起。合作社的少年们，向客人们表演了民族歌舞。蒙匈人民的友谊洋溢在春天的蒙古草原上。
    蒙匈两国党政代表团，经过友好的会谈，17日由泽登巴尔和明尼赫在会谈公报上签了字。正如泽登巴尔在乌兰巴托市举行的蒙匈友好大会上所说的，会谈双方满意地指出了两国人民的友谊日益增进和发展。双方对国际局势的看法取得完全一致的意见。表示支持争取民族独立的人民的斗争，谴责帝国主义制造紧张局势的侵略政策。匈牙利决定贷款给蒙古，帮助发展蒙古的农牧业建设，又一次表明了建立在无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的、相互帮助的兄弟情谊。
    匈牙利党政代表团在短短的五天访问中，和蒙古人民进一步建立了深厚的友情。他们带着蒙古人民的深情厚谊和乌兰巴托告别。然后往中国、越南和朝鲜三个兄弟国家继续进行友好的访问。
