        Amazing Facts

    Hercules
    According to observations by natural scientists, a beetle weighing one-twentieth of a gram can move a clod of mud weighing more than five grams, which is more than 100 times its own weight.
    If we had such strength, we could move balls weighing five or six thousand kilograms as if by magic, and elephants could push down mountains.
  (Translated by Yi from the Soviet "Young Natural Scientist")

    大力士
    根据自然科学家的观察，重二十分之一克的甲虫，能够推动五克多重，也就是比它自己重一百多倍的泥团。
    如果我们有这么大的力气，我们就可以像演魔术似的推动五六千公斤的球，大象就可以把山推倒。
  （贻译自苏联“少年自然科学家”）
