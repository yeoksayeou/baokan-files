Such Declaration
(Man Jiang Hong)

Qian Junrui is inexplicably rumored, a bizarre matter, what is the news! It is said that compatriots and brothers are actually plotting "independence." Devils are disguised as Buddhas, jackals cherish lamb's blood. Calculated over a hundred years, exhausting the people's fat and oil, passing on the mantle.

The mountains and rivers are magnificent, the evil atmosphere is extinguished. The east wind is strong, the rotten and withered are gone. Look at the giant towering, with fierce eyebrows and cracked eyes. Why bother with the ambition of interfering, like a moth flying into the fire, destroying itself. It is better to lay down the butcher knife, and immediately become a Buddha.

    如此声明
    （满江红）
    钱俊瑞无端传来，离奇事，是甚消息！见说道：同胞兄弟，竟图“独立”。魔鬼浑装菩萨相，豺狼偏惜羔羊血。算百年括尽人膏脂，传衣钵。
    山河壮，妖氛歇。东风劲，朽枯绝。看巨人巍巍，横眉眦裂。染指野心何苦也，灯蛾扑火身自灭。倒不如放下屠刀手，便成佛。
