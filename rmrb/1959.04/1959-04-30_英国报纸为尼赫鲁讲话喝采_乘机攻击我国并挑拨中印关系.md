Xinhua News Agency, London, 29th: Some British bourgeois newspapers are doing their utmost to cheer and applaud Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech on the situation in Tibet in the Indian People's House on the 27th, and are taking this opportunity to once again stir up trouble in Sino-Indian relations.

In commenting on Nehru's speech, these newspapers deliberately turned black and white upside down, attempting to portray the matter as India being "insulted" and "attacked" by Chinese public opinion, rather than India's expansionists wantonly slandering China and interfering in China's internal affairs, thereby provoking a justified counterattack from Chinese public opinion.

The Conservative Party's "Yorkshire Post" commented on the 28th that Nehru's speech "solemnly answered the absurd accusations made by the Chinese Communists against his country" and was "a protest against Beijing's use of cold war language 'disregarding the truth and etiquette' when attacking India on the Tibet issue." The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" said on the same day that Nehru "did not intend to humbly accept the insults of the Communists." This newspaper also touted Nehru's speech as "an example of noble restraint."

The "Yorkshire Post" particularly emphasized the point that Nehru denied in his speech that the Dalai Lama was abducted to India. This newspaper believes that this can serve to convince the people of Asian countries that "the Chinese Communists have abandoned their promises to Tibet and have used force to destroy the freedom of the Tibetan people."

The "News Chronicle" greatly praised the Indian government for accommodating Tibetan rebels, saying that "the Indian government puts humanitarian principles above considerations of interest, which is commendable."

    英国报纸为尼赫鲁讲话喝采
    乘机攻击我国并挑拨中印关系
    新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：一些英国资产阶级报纸尽力为印度总理尼赫鲁27日在印度人民院关于西藏局势的讲话喝采叫好，并且趁此再一次大事挑拨中印关系。
    这些报纸在评论尼赫鲁的讲话时，故意颠倒黑白，企图把事情说成是印度受到了中国舆论的“侮辱”和
  “攻击”，而不是印度的扩张主义分子放肆地诽谤中国和干涉中国内政，从而激起了中国舆论的正当的反击。
    保守党的“约克郡邮报”28日的评论说，尼赫鲁的这一讲话“庄严地回答了中国共产党人对他的国家进行的荒谬指责”，是“对北京在西藏问题上攻击印度时‘不顾真相和礼节使用冷战的语言’提出抗议”。自由党的“新闻纪事报”同一天说什么尼赫鲁“不打算卑躬屈节地接受共产党人的侮辱”。这家报纸还把尼赫鲁这一讲话捧成“崇高的克制精神的范例”。
    “约克郡邮报”特别强调这样一点：尼赫鲁在他的讲话中否认达赖喇嘛是被劫持到印度去的。这家报纸认为这就可以起到这样的作用：使亚洲各国人民相信“中国共产党人已经背弃了他们对西藏的诺言，他们用武力摧毁了西藏人民的自由”。
      “新闻纪事报”大事夸奖印度政府收容西藏叛乱分子，说什么“印度政府把人道主义原则放在利益的考虑之上，这是值得赞扬的”。
