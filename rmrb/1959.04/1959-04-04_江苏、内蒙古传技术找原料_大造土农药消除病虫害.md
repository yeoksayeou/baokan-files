(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd) In order to promptly eliminate diseases and insect pests on three types of wheat (barley, wheat, buckwheat) and ensure a large-scale high yield of these crops this year, the people's communes in Jiangsu are widely mobilizing the masses to vigorously develop the production of homemade pesticides, based on the principle of "local resources as the mainstay, combining local and foreign methods." According to incomplete statistics from mid-March, the people's communes across the province have newly established more than 5,000 homemade pesticide factories, producing more than 40 million catties of homemade pesticides to eliminate diseases and insect pests in the three wheat crops.

Members of the people's communes in Jiangsu are putting even greater effort into the production of homemade pesticides than last year. Each commune has set up one, several, or even dozens of homemade pesticide factories. The Suzhou area, fighting to achieve a thousand-catty special zone for the three wheat crops, already has 830 homemade pesticide factories, producing 6.8 million catties of various homemade pesticides, averaging more than two catties of pesticide per mu of wheat field. Changshu County, which was awarded a red flag by the Ministry of Commerce last year for producing homemade pesticides, has already stored more than six catties of homemade pesticides per mu of wheat field. This year, the homemade pesticide factories established by the people's communes in Jiangsu not only produce various plant-based homemade pesticides but have also begun to produce mineral-based pesticides using local methods, greatly increasing the variety of homemade pesticide products, and the efficacy of the pesticides has also significantly improved. To rapidly increase the output of homemade pesticides and not delay the need for disease and pest control in the three wheat crops, all regions have rationally arranged for a portion of the labor force to strengthen the homemade pesticide factories and have adopted various methods such as classes, visits, and internships to help members become familiar with and master the production process of various homemade pesticides, thereby expanding the technical team for producing homemade pesticides. The homemade pesticide factory of Qiaoqi Commune in Jiangyin County made 32 kinds of homemade pesticide samples and organized production teams and all members to visit, teaching the masses production techniques. Tangqiao Commune in Changshu County established a homemade pesticide technical school, where whoever invented a method or had experience would become the teacher. Through classroom lectures, sample exhibitions, and on-site internships, more than 20 commune members have mastered the general production process and operating techniques of pesticides.

To solve the problem of raw materials for making homemade pesticides, all regions widely mobilized the masses to collect, find, and excavate various wild plants and minerals that can be used to make pesticides on the spot. Lianyungang City found more than ten kinds of medicinal materials that can be used to make pesticides in the Yuntai Mountain area, such as fleeceflower root, hawthorn, lycoris radiata, and twin buds. Preliminary surveys show that the annual output of medicinal material resources in the Yuntai Mountain area that can be used to make homemade pesticides is at least one million catties or more, which will become the raw material base for homemade pesticides in Lianyungang City. Shedu Commune in Liyang County recently discovered barite and fluorite, minerals that can be made into barium polysulfide, a special medicine for preventing stem rust of the three wheat crops. The commune members brought tools, built grass sheds on the barren mountains as dormitories and canteens, overcame numerous difficulties, and increased the daily mining volume from 10,000 catties to 60,000 catties. Because the area for disease and pest control in the three wheat crops is larger this year than last year, the need for homemade pesticides is greater than last year. On the basis of summarizing and promoting the successful experience of mobilizing the masses to vigorously develop homemade pesticides last year, all regions are seizing the opportunity to go deep into the masses to collect good "prescriptions" and promote them locally.

(Our Hohhot Dispatch, 3rd) Rural people's communes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have recently launched a mass campaign to manufacture homemade pesticides. Various localities have held training courses on manufacturing homemade pesticides, mobilized Chinese medicine practitioners and herdsmen to collect pharmaceutical raw materials in the mountains, and established pesticide factories in the communes to begin mass production of various homemade pesticides.

Currently, more than 100 pesticide factories in the rural people's communes of Zhaowuda League, Jerim League, and Hulunbuir League in the eastern part of the autonomous region have produced more than 100 kinds of homemade pesticides, totaling about 500,000 catties, using various poisonous weeds produced locally. The communes in these areas are now continuing to collect raw materials in large quantities and are setting up more pharmaceutical factories. Zhaowuda League proposed to have an average reserve of 20 to 50 catties of homemade pesticides per mu of land, to ensure that all seeds are disinfected and that high-yield and basic farmland are all treated with poisonous soil and poisonous manure to eliminate underground pests. The communes in the suburbs of Chifeng City mobilized the entire population to produce more than 58,000 catties of homemade pesticides.

The mass campaign to manufacture homemade pesticides has also begun in the agricultural areas of the western part of the autonomous region. The people's communes in Zhuozi County, Ulanqab League, recently collected more than 400,000 catties of raw materials and trial-produced 12 kinds of homemade pesticides. Among them, the "seven-in-one" insecticide is very effective in killing insects and is being mass-produced. The "666" insecticide powder successfully trial-produced by the staff of the supply and marketing department of Ulan Commune in Dalad Banner, Ikezhao League, has been tested by the Commercial Department of the Autonomous Region, and its quality has reached the level of imported goods.

    大造土农药消除病虫害
    本报南京3日电　为了及时扑灭三麦（大麦、小麦、元麦）病虫害，确保今年三麦大面积高产，江苏各地人民公社广泛发动群众，根据“以土为主，土洋结合”的方针，大力开展土农药生产。到3月中旬的不完全统计，全省各人民公社共新建了土农药厂五千多个，已生产扑灭三麦病虫害的土农药四千多万斤。
    江苏各地人民公社的社员们，以比去年更大的劲头，投入土农药生产。每个公社都办起一个、几个、十几个土农药厂。为争取实现三麦千斤专区而战的苏州专区，已有土农药厂八百三十个，生产了各种土农药六百八十万斤，平均每亩麦田已有二斤多农药。去年曾获商业部颁发的生产土农药红旗的常熟县，已为每亩麦田储备了六斤多土农药。今年，江苏各人民公社办起的土农药厂，不仅生产各种植物性土农药，也开始用土法生产矿物性农药，使土农药产品品种大大增加，药效也有显著提高。为了迅速提高土农药的产量，不误三麦防治病虫害的需要，各地都合理地安排一部分劳动力加强了土农药厂，并采取上课、参观、实习等各种各样方法，帮助社员熟悉和掌握各种土农药生产过程，从而扩大了生产土农药的技术队伍。江阴县峭岐公社办的土农药厂，做出三十二种土农药样品，组织各生产队、全体社员参观，向群众传授生产技术。常熟县塘桥公社，建立了一所土农药技术学校，谁发明的、谁有经验，谁就当老师。通过课堂讲授、样品展览、现场实习等方法，全公社已有二十多个社员掌握了一般农药的生产过程和操作技术。
    为了解决制造土农药的原料，各地广泛发动群众，就地采集、到处寻找和挖掘能做农药的各种野生植物和矿物。新海连市在云台山区找到了何首乌、山里红、石蒜、双芽等十多种能制农药的药材，初步普查，云台山区能制土农药的药材资源年产量至少在百万斤以上，将成为新海连市土农药原料基地。溧阳县社堵公社最近发现了重晶石和萤石，这种矿物能制成防治三麦秆锈病特效药多硫化钡。社员们带了工具，在荒山上搭起草棚做宿舍和饭堂，克服了重重困难，使每日开采量由一万斤提高到六万斤。由于今年三麦防治病虫害面积比去年大，所以需要的土农药比去年多，各地在总结推广去年发动群众，大搞土农药成功经验的基础上，抓紧时机，深入群众采集善“方”，就地推广。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（严锋明）
    本报呼和浩特3日电　内蒙古自治区农村人民公社，最近开展大造土农药运动。各地举办了制造土农药训练班，发动中医和牧工上山采集制药原料，并在公社里建立农药厂，开始大量生产各种土制农药。
    目前，自治区东部的昭乌达盟、哲里木盟和呼伦贝尔盟农村人民公社的一百多座农药厂，已用当地出产的各种毒草制成土农药一百多种，共约五十万斤。这些地方的公社现正继续大量采集原料，兴办更多的制药厂。昭乌达盟提出要让每亩地平均贮备土农药二十斤到五十斤，做到种籽全部消毒，高额丰产田和基本田全部施用毒土毒粪，消灭地下害虫。赤峰市郊区各公社全民动手，制出了五万八千多斤土农药。
    自治区西部农业区群众性的制造土农药运动也已开始。乌兰察布盟卓资县各人民公社最近采集原料四十多万斤，试制十二种土农药。其中七合一杀虫药剂杀虫效力很强，正在大量生产。伊克昭盟达拉特旗乌兰公社供销部职工试制成功的“六六六”杀虫粉，经过自治区商业厅化验，质量已达到进口货水平。
