Title: Isn't This a Fact?

Indian expansionists have long had their eyes on China's Tibet. Sometimes they wave flags and shout, spitting everywhere; sometimes they act coy and put on a false mask of righteousness. After the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" was published, their ugly intentions became even more obvious and nakedly exposed.

For example, Narayan, the leader of the Indian Socialist Party, shamelessly said at a rally held by the "Indian Support Tibet Committee" in Bombay on April 22nd: "According to the old agreement between the British and the Chinese, the latter has suzerainty over Tibet, while the former enjoys the monopoly right to develop that country." And "after independence, India became the successor to this monopoly right." Here, let's not talk about the content of the conversation, just looking at the name "Support Tibet Committee" is enough to make people furious. Tibet has been Chinese territory since ancient times. It is a matter of course for the Chinese people to quell the Tibetan rebellion; however, Indian expansionists insist on interfering in this matter, insisting on calling Tibet an "independent country" and establishing a so-called "Support Tibet Committee." Isn't this blatant separatist activity, undermining China's unity, and interfering in China's internal affairs? The so-called "support for Tibet" is, to put it bluntly, supporting a small group of Tibetan rebels. The name of this committee should be changed to "Indian Expansionists Support Tibetan Rebels Committee" to match the reality. Indian expansionists are trying to extend their black hands into Tibet through the Tibetan rebels. This goes without saying. Narayan's so-called "inheritance" of Britain's "monopoly rights" in Tibet is a self-confession. Can't people see the clear fact that Indian expansionists are holding up the mantle of British imperialism!

The whole world knows that India was a British colony for a long time, and the Indian people suffered the oppression and enslavement of British imperialists for a long time. Britain invaded India in the seventeenth century and directly ruled India for as long as one hundred and ninety years. British imperialists sucked the blood and sweat of the Indian people, causing millions of farmers and craftsmen to starve to death in the streets. According to British statistics, which were obviously greatly reduced, as many as fifteen million people starved to death in India in just twenty-five years from 1875 to 1900! After arduous struggles, the Indian people finally freed their motherland from the clutches of British imperialism and achieved independence and freedom, and formally announced on January 26, 1950, that they had become an independent and autonomous democratic republic. However, in a short period of time, Indian expansionists "forgot the pain once the wound healed," and were actually willing to recognize the thief as their father, acting as the successor to British imperialism, accepting the mantle of British aggressors, and妄想(wang xiang - presumptuously hoping) to inherit the so-called monopoly rights of British aggressors in Tibet, attempting to impose the suffering that the Indian people could not endure on the Tibetan people! Isn't this a fact?

Facts are facts after all, and they stand tall like the Himalayas. Indian expansionists want to ignore the facts, want to deny the facts, and even want to take out the stinking old almanac of British imperialists and treat it as a sacred scripture. Will this have good results? The Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, only know one eternal and unchanging truth, that is, Tibet has always been and will always be an inseparable part of the motherland's territory. No one can separate it by any means.

The fact that Indian expansionists have been so rampant and so nakedly interfering in China in the recent period cannot but make us feel extremely angry and extremely regretful. In our great neighbor, there are such unfilial descendants: they disregard the tradition of friendly relations between the two peoples, and damage the friendly relations between the two peoples for the sake of the private interests of a small group. This only benefits British and American imperialism. If they want to hold on to the mantle of British aggressors, then let them go. Let us just remind them that holding this notorious mantle, even if they travel all over the world, they will not receive any alms.

    这难道不是事实吗？

    印度扩张主义分子染指我国西藏，是由来久矣的了。他们时而摇旗呐喊，唾沫四溅；时而又忸怩作态，戴上一副假面具冒充正神；在所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”发表以后，他们那丑恶的居心，就更加昭然若揭，就更加赤裸裸地暴露出来了。
    例如，身为印度社会党领袖的纳拉扬，4月22日在“印度支援西藏委员会”在孟买举行的一次集会上，居然厚颜无耻地说：“根据英国人和中国人之间的旧协定，后者拥有对西藏的宗主权，而前者享有发展那个国家的垄断权利。”而“在独立以后，印度成为这个垄断权利的继承者。”这里，先不说那谈话内容，单看看“支援西藏委员会”这个名称，就足以使人发指了。西藏自古以来就是中国的领土。中国人民平定西藏叛乱，本来是天经地义的事情；但是印度扩张主义分子却硬要在这件事情里面插手，硬要把西藏说成是“独立的国家”，来成立一个什么“支援西藏委员会”，这不是明目张胆地进行分裂活动，破坏中国统一，干涉中国内政么？所谓“支援西藏”，说得明确点，就是支援西藏那一小撮叛乱分子。这个委员会改名为“印度的扩张主义分子支援西藏叛乱分子委员会”才是名实相符的。印度的扩张主义分子，正是企图通过西藏叛乱分子，把他们的黑手伸进西藏。这一点，不用细说，纳拉扬的所谓“继承”英国对西藏的“垄断权利”云云，正是一种不打自招。人们难道还看不出，印度扩张主义分子捧着英帝国主义衣钵这件明明白白的事实！
    全世界都知道，印度长时期以来是英帝国主义的殖民地，印度人民长时期以来受着英帝国主义者的压榨和奴役。英国自十七世纪侵入印度，直接统治印度达一百九十年之久。英帝国主义者吸干了印度人民的血汗，使得千千万万的农民和手工业者饿倒街头。根据显然被大大地缩小了的英国统计材料，1875年至1900年仅仅二十五年之内，印度饿死的人竟达一千五百万之多！印度人民经过了艰苦的斗争，才使祖国挣脱了英帝国主义的魔掌，取得了独立和自由，在1950年1月26日，正式宣布成为独立自主的民主共和国。但是，曾几何时，印度扩张主义分子便“好了疮疤忘了痛”，居然甘心认贼作父，充当英帝国主义继承人的角色，把英国侵略者的衣钵接受过来，妄想继承所谓英国侵略者在西藏的垄断权利，企图把印度人民不能忍受的痛苦强加到西藏人民头上来！这难道不是事实吗？
    事实总归是事实，它就像喜马拉雅山那样巍然屹立。印度的扩张主义者想无视事实，想抵赖事实，甚至还想把英帝国主义者的腐臭了的老皇历拿出来，当圣经神符，这会有好结果吗？中国人民包括西藏人民在内，只知道一个永恒不变的真理，那就是西藏从来就是而且永远将是祖国领土的一部分。任何人用任何方法也把它分离不走。
    印度扩张主义分子在最近一个时期内如此嚣张，如此赤裸裸干涉中国的这些事实，不能不使我们在万分愤怒之中，也感到万分遗憾。在我们伟大的邻邦，竟出了如此不肖的子孙：他们不顾两国人民一贯友好相处的传统，为了一个小集团的私利，来破坏两国人民友好关系。这只是有利于英美帝国主义的。如果他们要紧紧捧着英国侵略者衣钵不放，那就随他们去吧。只是让我们提醒他们一句，捧着这臭名远扬的衣钵，即使走遍全世界，他也不会得到一点布施。
