A Short Commentary

    Increase Ferroalloy Production

    Following the national conferences on ores, coke, and refractory materials, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently convened a national ferroalloy conference. The conference proposed the task of developing the ferroalloy industry to ensure the production of 18 million tons of steel this year.

    What are ferroalloys? Ferroalloys are the silicomanganese, ferromanganese, and various special ferroalloys necessary for steelmaking. They, along with ores, coke, and refractory materials, are known as the four major materials for steel production. More than 20 kilograms of ferroalloys are needed to make one ton of steel (average calculation for ordinary and special steels). Without ferroalloys, especially silicomanganese and ferromanganese, not only can special steel not be made, but ordinary steel also cannot be made, just as tofu cannot be made without brine.

    Since 1958, China's ferroalloy industry has developed significantly. This year, as the annual steel output rises to 18 million tons, the demand for ferroalloy production will increase sharply. If the steel marshal urged ferroalloys to mount a steed last year, this year, ferroalloy production needs to keep pace with the steel marshal and accelerate accordingly. Just as the entire national economy needs to develop proportionately, the internal system of the steel industry must also maintain a certain proportional relationship. The supply of the four major materials and the rolling of steel must adapt to the growth of steel production. Ferroalloys are no exception.

    At present, China has built a considerable number of large, medium, and small ferroalloy electric furnaces and blast furnaces. However, the production efficiency of existing ferroalloy electric furnaces has not been fully realized, and the output of quite a few electric furnaces has not reached the design targets. For example, the daily output of a 400 kVA electric furnace can be as high as two tons, but as low as less than 800 kilograms. This wide disparity indicates that the potential of electric furnaces still needs to be greatly tapped. In order to raise the various indicators of most electric furnaces to advanced levels, a red banner competition movement centered on improving the utilization coefficient of ferroalloy electric furnaces should be launched immediately, focusing on high yield, high quality, and electricity conservation. Through vigorous mass movements, improve the proportioning and management of raw materials, select and manufacture electrodes, master the operating methods of intensified smelting, and maintain and repair the furnace body, and reduce electricity consumption. Strive for the high-yield indicators of advanced electric furnaces.

    Here, we need to especially emphasize the issue of reducing electricity consumption. Reducing electricity consumption is the most important part of breaking through the technological barrier in ferroalloy production. Ferroalloy electric furnaces are extremely power-intensive equipment, commonly known as "electric tigers." If each electric furnace saves 10% of electricity, this electricity can be used to produce 10% more ferroalloys, which is of great economic value. At present, the power consumption of many electric furnaces is still greater than the design requirements. Some units feel that there is a shortage of electricity on the one hand, and on the other hand, they tolerate the phenomenon of excessive power consumption. These are all abnormal and should be quickly improved.

    Breaking through the technical barrier is the key to improving ferroalloy production. Smelting ferroalloys is not particularly difficult, just like making steel and iron. As long as there is abundant drive and a strict scientific spirit, the technological barrier of ferroalloy production can be quickly broken through.

    增产铁合金
    中央冶金工业部继召开全国矿石、焦炭、耐火材料等专业会议之后，最近又召开了全国铁合金会议，提出了为保证今年生产一千八百万吨钢，相应地发展铁合金工业的任务。
    铁合金是什么？铁合金就是炼钢所必需的矽铁、锰铁以及各种特种铁合金，它和矿石、焦炭、耐火材料并称钢铁生产的四大材料。炼一吨钢需要二十多公斤铁合金（普通钢和特种钢平均计算）。没有铁合金，特别是没有矽铁和锰铁，不仅特种钢炼不成，普通钢也炼不成，如同没有卤水点不成豆腐一样。
    1958年以来，我国铁合金工业有了很大发展。今年，随着钢的年产量将上升到一千八百万吨，就要求铁合金的产量急剧增长。如果说，在去年钢铁元帅催促铁合金跨上了骏马，今年铁合金生产还需要随着钢铁元帅的步伐，快马加鞭，相应而行。正如整个国民经济要按比例地发展一样，钢铁工业系统的内部也要保持一定的比例关系。四大材料的供应，钢材的轧制都要适应钢铁产量的增长。铁合金也不例外。
    目前我国已建设了相当数量的大、中、小铁合金电炉和高炉，但是，现有铁合金电炉的生产效率远没有充分发挥出来，有相当多电炉的产量没有达到设计指标。例如四百千伏安电炉的日产量，高的已经达到二吨，低的还不到八百公斤。这种高低悬殊的状况，说明了电炉的潜力还有待大力挖掘。为了把大部分电炉的各项指标提高到先进水平，应立即掀起一个以提高铁合金电炉利用系数为中心的高产优质节电红旗竞赛运动。通过大搞群众运动，做好原料的配比和管理，做好电极的选配和制作，掌握强化冶炼的操作方法，做好炉体的维护和检修，降低电耗。力争先进电炉的高产指标。
    这里，我们需要特别强调一下降低电耗问题。降低电耗一项是突破铁合金生产技术关中的最重要一环。铁合金电炉是一种耗电量极大的设备，俗称“电老虎”，如果每个电炉节约10％的电量，就可以用这些电多增产10％的铁合金，经济价值极大。目前，很多电炉的耗电量还大于设计要求，有些单位一方面感到电量不足，另一方面又容忍电耗过大的现象存在。这些都是不正常的，应迅速改进。
    突破技术关，是提高铁合金的关键，冶炼铁合金和炼钢炼铁一样，并没有什么特殊困难。只要有充沛的干劲和严格的科学精神、铁合金生产的技术关就可以迅速突破。
