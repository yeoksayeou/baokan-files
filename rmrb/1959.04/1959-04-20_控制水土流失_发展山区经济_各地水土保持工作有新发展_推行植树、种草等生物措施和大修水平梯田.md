　　Controlling Soil Erosion, Developing Mountainous Economy
　　New Developments in Soil and Water Conservation Work Across Regions
　　Promoting Biological Measures Such as Planting Trees and Grass, and Extensive Construction of Level Terraces

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Since last winter, the soil and water conservation work carried out in various regions has further expanded the area under control of soil erosion, creating favorable conditions for increasing agricultural production and developing diversified economies in mountainous areas.
　　This year's soil and water conservation work is being carried out on the basis of summarizing the rich experience of the Great Leap Forward, with improved quality and stricter requirements. In provinces with a relatively good foundation in the past, such as Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong, and Henan, high-standard models of soil and water conservation have been established this year. The goal is to truly achieve mountainous areas becoming gardens, sloping land becoming terraces, gullies becoming plains, and farmland becoming irrigated; a new atmosphere has emerged where "water does not leave the ridges, mud does not leave the gullies, no mountain is not green, and all water is clear." The high-standard management campaign carried out in Lin County, Shanxi Province, has brought the loess hilly areas, where soil erosion was severe, under preliminary control of soil and water loss over an area of more than four million mu. More than one and a half million mu of sloping farmland has been terraced, and 15,000 mu of level terraces have been built. Thirty-four clear and flood drainage canals have been excavated, and more than 10,000 mu of soil and water conservation forests have been created. The high-standard soil and water conservation campaign in the Qinglong River basin in Jia County, Henan Province, has fundamentally changed the situation where "heavy rain washes away the mountains, and floods submerge the low-lying land." People have adopted the principle of "treating both slopes and gullies, with emphasis on treating slopes," cutting ridges and filling gullies. And using methods such as inner lining and outer padding, raising high areas and padding low areas, and widening narrow plots, small pieces of farmland with abundant stones and little soil, uneven heights, and inconsistent slopes were transformed into relatively advanced level terraces with "flat ground like a mirror, ridges straight as a line, every field with a ridge, every plot with an outlet," suitable for mechanized farming. Other regions, such as Huajialing in Gansu and Erquanshan in Inner Mongolia, have also seen greater and better development this year. These high-standard banners of soil and water conservation work not only set an example for other regions but also explored and accumulated valuable experience for gradually realizing the great ideal of turning the land into a garden.
　　In areas where less soil and water conservation work was done last year, there has been greater development this year. Provinces such as Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei have completed their annual tasks ahead of schedule. Recent statistics show that Heilongjiang has completed the preliminary control of soil and water conservation over an area of more than 4,700 square kilometers, and Jiangxi has completed more than 1,500 square kilometers, exceeding the amount completed last year.
　　In terms of methods for controlling soil erosion, various regions have paid particular attention to biological measures such as planting trees and grass. During the spring afforestation season, many regions have planted trees on a large scale that are easy to survive and resistant to disasters, such as poplar, willow, elm, black locust, and masson pine. Among the more than ten million mu of afforestation area completed in Anhui Province, more than five million mu of such soil and water conservation forest belts have been created. At the same time, this year various regions have also paid attention to planting pasture grass on sloping land that has been returned to forestry, such as Huajialing in Gansu, which planted 120,000 mu of grass this year, which not only conserved soil and water but also increased a lot of feed, fertilizer, and fuel.
　　In terms of engineering measures for soil and water conservation, this year's significant feature is that level terraces have developed significantly. Due to the shortage of labor after the comprehensive leap forward, many regions have established soil and water conservation infrastructure professional teams to carry out year-round construction and project maintenance. There are many young people in Shandong, Jilin, Gansu, and other provinces who are carrying red flags and going deep into the barren mountains and wilderness to carry out arduous work to change the face of nature. The Dongsheng People's Commune in Yitong, Jilin Province, organized a 32-member soil and water conservation professional team, which not only made outstanding achievements in mountain and water management but also planted trees and vegetables in the mountains and engaged in economic crops on a large scale, which greatly increased the income of the commune.

　　控制水土流失　发展山区经济
　　各地水土保持工作有新发展
　　推行植树、种草等生物措施和大修水平梯田
    本报讯　去年冬天以来各地开展的水土保持工作，进一步扩大了控制水土流失的面积，为增加农业生产，发展山区多种经济创造了有利条件。
    今年的水土保持工作是在总结大跃进丰富经验的基础上进行的，质量提高了，要求更为严格。在过去基础较好的甘肃、陕西、山西、山东、河南等省，今年都树立了水土保持高标准的典型。真正做到山区园林化，坡地梯田化，沟壑川台化，耕地水利化；出现了“水不下垣，泥不出沟，无山不绿，有水皆清”的新气象。山西临县开展的高标准治理运动，使全县四百多万亩水土流失严重的黄土丘陵区，初步控制了水土的流失，一百五十多万亩坡耕地实现了地埂化，并修成水平梯田一万五千亩，开挖清、洪水渠三十四条，营造了一万多亩水土保持林。河南郏县青龙河流域的水土保持高标准运动，基本上改变了“大雨山地尽冲坏，流到平洼把地淹”的情况。人们采取“坡沟兼治、治坡为主”的方针，削岭填沟。并用里砌外垫、起高垫低、窄块加宽等方法，将原来石多土少、高低不平、倾斜不一的小块农田，变成了“地平如镜面，地埂直如线，地地有埂，块块有口”适于机耕的较高级水平梯田。其他如甘肃的华家岭、内蒙的二泉山等地区，今年也有了更大、更好的发展。这些水土保持工作高标准的红旗，不但为其他地区树立了榜样；并且为逐步实现大地园林化的伟大理想，摸索、积累了宝贵的经验。
    在去年水土保持工作量做得较少的地区，今年有了较大的发展。黑龙江、江西、湖南、湖北等省已经提前完成了全年的任务。最近统计，黑龙江已完成水土保持初步控制面积四千七百多平方公里，江西已完成一千五百多平方公里，超过了去年完成的数量。
    各地在控制水土流失的方法方面，特别抓紧了植树、种草等生物措施。许多地区在春季造林季节，大规模地栽植容易成活、抗灾力强的杨、柳、榆、洋槐、马尾松等树种。安徽省已完成的一千多万亩造林面积中，就营造了这种水土保持林带五百多万亩。同时，今年各地也注意在退耕的坡地种上牧草，如甘肃华家岭今年就种草十二万亩，不仅保持了水土，而且增加了许多饲料、肥料和燃料。
    在水土保持的工程措施方面，今年显著的特点是水平梯田有了较大的发展。由于全面跃进后劳力紧张，许多地区都建立了水土保持基建专业队，进行常年兴修和工程养护。山东、吉林、甘肃等省都有许多青年，扛着红旗，深入荒山野岭，为改变大自然的面貌进行艰巨的工作。吉林伊通东胜人民公社组织了三十二人的水土保持专业队，他们不但在治山治水方面做出了出色的成绩，并且在山区种树、种菜，大搞经济作物，使公社增加了很多收入。
