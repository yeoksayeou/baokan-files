　　On Flower-and-Bird Painting Creation
　　Guo Weiqu
　　Flower-and-bird painting is a unique artistic expression in Chinese painting art, with a developmental history spanning thirteen to fourteen hundred years. Throughout the generations, flower-and-bird painters have demonstrated their genius and wisdom in expressing objective reality, creating valuable experiences and inheriting and developing the excellent traditions of realism. They have created countless masterpieces of different styles and schools.

　　From the time flower-and-bird painting gradually transitioned from being a background in figure painting to an independent art form, it has served the broad masses. Through the skillful expression of the painters' brushes, the flower-and-bird images appearing on the screen have reached the point of being "vivid and fragrant," gaining the love of the broad masses. For thousands of years, lively flower-and-bird paintings have been an indispensable decoration in the daily lives of the Chinese people.

　　However, there are still some urgent problems to be solved in the theory and creation of flower-and-bird painting. Some people believe that flower-and-bird painting cannot express reality, cannot serve politics, and even raise questions about inheriting and developing flower-and-bird painting creation. This is a one-sidedness in ideological understanding, that is, a narrow understanding of art serving politics. The road of art serving the people is extremely broad. Figure painting in painting can directly express reality and class struggle, but we cannot say that flower-and-bird painting cannot express reality. It's just that the subject matter of flower-and-bird painting is different, and the expression methods and forms are also different. Therefore, the role of flower-and-bird painting as a reflection of reality is also different from that of figure painting. Many flower-and-bird, insect, and fish works by contemporary flower-and-bird painting master Qi Baishi, especially works like "Let's See How Long You Can Behave Rampantly," fully express the author's inner thoughts and feelings. At the same time, it also expresses the author's optimistic spirit towards life, inspiring the audience. Isn't this serving a certain politics?

　　Of course, flower-and-bird painting still focuses more on lyrical atmosphere, moving people with artistic images that are higher and more beautiful than nature. Like a lyrical poem praising the beautiful rivers and mountains, it strengthens people's love for the motherland and encourages people's enthusiasm for building a socialist society. The flowers and birds of nature, through the hard work and concrete expression of the painters, enable the broad masses to obtain beautiful spiritual enjoyment. This is similar to how we always love to see the red leaves of the Western Hills in the clear autumn, to see the peonies in Zhongshan Park in the bright spring, or to appreciate the flock of geese rippling in the green waves in the shadows of fallen flowers, which can relieve the difficulties of work and enhance physical and mental health, and is of positive significance.

　　Flower-and-bird painting creation under the guidance of the theory of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, of course, must have political and ideological content. Many painters also actively want to serve politics with their works, which is very good, but we must not ignore the special art form of flower-and-bird painting and forcibly combine it with politics. For example, some paintings depict a few small fish and inscribe "Strive to Go Upstream," or draw a few sunflowers and inscribe "Develop Production," and so on. Doing this occasionally as a postscript is not completely impossible. The problem is that it is wrong to regard this as a new path for flower-and-bird painting. Recently, some people have made various specific requirements for flower-and-bird painting, or believe that flower-and-bird painting can only depict certain kinds of flowers, and not others, and so on. This requirement is also a one-sided understanding of art serving politics. Of course, we should not have the slightest negative emotion in today's booming nationwide Great Leap Forward. Therefore, in our paintings, the mood of lamenting spring and grieving autumn, desolate and lonely sentiments, must be swept away. But we cannot simply see it as this can be painted and that cannot be painted. I think that anything that can encourage the people's emotions and enrich the people's spiritual life through flower-and-bird painting creation can be painted. Taking the painting of withered lotus as an example, it does not necessarily mean that it is expressing negative emotions. The question is what position you stand on, what angle you take, and with what emotion you express it. For example, the withered lotus painted by Qi Baishi not only does not have negative emotions, but can also make people feel the indomitable spirit of the lotus flowers in the desolate autumn wind, thereby giving the reader an unexpected inspiration. Another example is when the rulers of the Qing Dynasty were monopolizing the painting world with decadent and listless naturalistic paintings, Bada Shanren, Shitao, and the Yangzhou School shocked the art world with their unrestrained and bold brushwork and vivid expressions, fighting against the decadent style. Their new style was widely welcomed by society.

　　In summary, whether it is thinking that flower-and-bird cannot reflect reality, or forcibly combining flower-and-bird painting with politics, it is the result of not having a good understanding of the artistic function of flower-and-bird painting. Mr. Lu Xun said as early as in his "Draft of Opinions on the Dissemination of Fine Arts": "Fine art is based on the profound nature and temperament of people, and the lofty preferences of people. ... Now, with this beauty and greatness, a noble sentiment is preserved, and evil thoughts do not arise." I think flower-and-bird painting has this effect.

　　Having said that, does it mean that flower-and-bird painting does not need to be innovated? Of course not. The adoption of old forms must involve deletion. Since there is deletion, there must be additions. The result is the emergence of new forms, which is change. Only those revivalists and conservatives believe that today's flower-and-bird painting does not need to be reformed, innovated, created, and developed, and can still remain at the original stage. If the painter himself does not seriously transform his thinking first, but only plays tricks on the inscription and subject matter, excellent works will never appear. The result of "superficial renewal with old thoughts" is incompatible with the creative spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.

　　Therefore, flower-and-bird painters must first go deep into life, integrate their thoughts and feelings with the masses, and discover materials in real life; break the old and establish the new, and strive to create; at the same time, continuously improve artistic skills, and strive to learn from the strengths of ancient and modern Chinese and foreign painting masters; this can correctly inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of flower-and-bird painting, and create works worthy of our great era.

　　谈花鸟画创作
　　郭味蕖
    花鸟画是我国绘画艺术中的一种特殊艺术表现形式，它已经有一千三四百年的发展历史。历代的花鸟画家们，在表现客观现实的实践中，发挥了天才的智慧，创造了宝贵的经验，继承和发扬了现实主义的优良传统。创作出了无数的不同风格气派的杰作。
    花鸟画从人物画的背景地位逐步过渡到一种独立艺术风貌的时候起，就为广大的群众服务。通过画家们画笔的巧妙的表现，出现在画面上的花鸟形象，达到了“活色生香”的地步，获得了广大群众的热爱。千百年来，生动活泼的花鸟画，已经是我国人民日常生活中不可缺少的装饰了。
    但是，目前在花鸟画理论和创作中，还存在着一些急待解决的问题。有人认为花鸟画不能表现现实，不能为政治服务，甚至提出了对继承和发展花鸟画创作的疑问。这是思想认识上的片面性，也就是对艺术为政治服务的狭隘理解。艺术为人民服务的道路，是极广阔的。绘画中的人物画能直接表现现实和阶级斗争，但我们也不能说花鸟画就不能表现现实。不过是花鸟画的取材不同，表现方法和形式也不同。因此，作为现实反映的花鸟画与人物画的作用也就不同。当代花鸟画家齐白石大师的许多花鸟虫鱼作品，特别是像“看尔横行到几时”等都充分表达了作者内心的思想情感。同时也表达了作者对生活的乐观主义精神，使观众得到鼓舞。难道这不是为一定政治服务的吗？
    当然，花鸟画还是比较偏重于抒情气氛，以作品中那些比自然更高更美的艺术形象而感人的。它和一首歌咏锦绣河山的抒情诗一样使人读了要加强对祖国的热爱，鼓舞人民对建设社会主义社会的干劲。自然界的花鸟经过画家们的辛勤劳动和具体表现，使广大群众获得美的精神享受。这和每当晴朗的秋天，我们总是爱去看看西山红叶；在明媚的春光里，要到中山公园去看看牡丹；或是在落红影里欣赏欣赏荡漾在绿波中的鹅群，可以解除工作中的困顿，增强身心健康，同样是有积极意义的。
    在革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的理论指导下的花鸟画创作，当然是要具有政治思想性。许多画家也积极地想用作品为政治服务，这种热情是很好的，但也不能不顾花鸟画这一特殊的艺术形式，而生硬地去结合政治。例如有些画画几条小鱼就题上“力争上游”，画几株向日葵就题上“发展生产”种种。偶一为之，作为题跋不是完全不可的。问题在于把它当成新的花鸟画的道路就不对了。近来也有人对花鸟画提出各种各样太具体的要求，或者认为花鸟画只能画某几种花，而不能画别的，等等。这种要求也是对艺术为政治服务的片面理解。当然，我们今天在轰轰烈烈的全民大跃进中，是不应该有丝毫的消极的感情的。因此，在我们的画幅里，伤春悲秋，荒凉索寞的情调，要扫除净尽。但不能简单地看成这可以画那不可以画，我觉得，凡是通过花鸟画创作能鼓舞人民的情绪、丰富人民的精神生活的都可以画。就以画残荷来看也并不等于是在表现消极的情感，问题在你站在什么立场什么角度上和以什么情感去表现它。例如齐白石画的残荷，不但没有消极情绪反而能使人感到荷花在萧杀的秋风中的顽强斗争的不屈精神，从而给予读者一种意外的启示。又如在清代统治者正以委靡不振的自然主义的绘画垄断画坛的时候，八大山人、石涛和扬州派诸家，以笔墨淋漓的豪迈气魄，以活生生的表现形象震惊了艺坛，拚击了颓风。他们的这种新风格，就受到了社会上的普遍欢迎。
    综上所述，不论是认为花鸟不能反映现实也好，或是用花鸟画去生硬地结合政治也好，都是对花鸟画的艺术功能没有很好研究的结果。鲁迅先生在“拟播布美术意见书”一文中早就说过：“美艺是以渊邃人之性情。崇高人之好尚。……今以此优美而崇大之。则高洁之情独存。邪秽之念不作。”我认为花鸟画就有这种作用。
    这样说来，是不是花鸟画就不要革新了呢？当然不是。旧形式的采用，必有删除。既有删除，必有所增益。这结果是新形式的出现，也就是变革。只有那些复古主义者和保守主义者，才认为今天的花鸟画，不用再破旧革新，创造发扬，可以仍然停留在原来的阶段。如果画家自己不先认真改造思想，只是在题词取材上玩弄花样，绝不会出现优秀的作品。“皮毛改新，心思仍旧”的结果，是和革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作精神不能协调的。
    因此，花鸟画家必须先深入生活，把自己的思想、情感和群众打成一片，在现实生活中发掘素材；破旧立新，努力创作；同时不断提高艺术技巧，努力学习古今中外绘画大师们的长处；这才能正确继承和发扬花鸟画的优良传统，创作出无愧于我们这个伟大时代的作品。
