Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 14th: Premier Grotewohl stated this afternoon at a grand gathering in Halle commemorating the bicentennial of the death of the great German composer Handel that we will do everything in our power to prevent violations against peace, against the peoples of all nations, and against human culture.

In his speech, he once again welcomed the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, aimed at safeguarding peace in Europe. He said that the Soviet government's proposal has sparked extensive discussions in both Germanys. The fundamental idea of this treaty has won the sympathy of all peace-loving people.

Grotewohl said that the days for the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference and the summit meeting are not far off, but until now, we have not seen any indication from the Bonn government that it approves of our suggestion that representatives of the two German states should have a unified position. The Bonn government continues to oppose the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and continues to oppose the formation of a confederation between the two Germanys because it opposes understanding and reunification.

Grotewohl emphasized that, however, we will continue our efforts in the spirit of willingness to understand.

In his speech, Premier Grotewohl gave a high appraisal of Handel's artistic activities.

To commemorate this music master, the German Democratic Republic is holding the Handel Music Week in his hometown of Halle from April 11th to 19th.

    格罗提渥谈德国统一问题
    谴责波恩政府阻挠谅解和重新统一
    新华社柏林14日电　格罗提渥总理今天下午在哈雷纪念德国伟大作曲家亨德尔逝世二百周年的盛大集会上说，我们将尽一切力量阻止对和平、对各国人民和人类文化的侵犯。
    他在讲话中再一次对苏联提出的旨在保卫欧洲和平的缔结对德和约的建议表示欢迎。他说，苏联政府的这一建议在两个德国引起了广泛的讨论。这个和约的基本思想博得了一切希望和平的人们的同情。
    格罗提渥说，距离日内瓦外长会议和最高级会议的日子已经不远了，可是直到现在，我们还没见到波恩政府对我们的关于两个德国国家代表应有一致立场的建议，作出任何赞同的表示。波恩政府仍然反对缔结对德和约，仍然反对两个德国结成邦联，因为它反对谅解和重新统一。
    格罗提渥强调说，但是，我们将本着愿意谅解的精神继续努力。
    格罗提渥总理在讲话中对亨德尔的艺术活动给予很高的评价。
    为了纪念这位音乐大师，德意志民主共和国从4月11日到19日在他的故乡哈雷举行亨德尔音乐周。
