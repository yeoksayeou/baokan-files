Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Enriching and Colourful
Guangzhou's Cultural Work is Very Active

(Reported by this newspaper) Guangzhou's cultural work has achieved great success by implementing the policy of combining popularization with improvement.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, Guangzhou's cultural work has correctly implemented the Party's policy on literature and art, resulting in a widespread cultural popularization. There are more than 3,000 amateur drama troupes, song and dance ensembles, and other artistic groups in the city, nearly 4,000 clubs, cultural centers, and libraries run by the masses themselves, and more than 20,000 mass entertainment organizations such as filmstrip groups, broadcasting groups, and music groups. These mass artistic organizations are found in factories, communes, schools, and streets, and their activities include dozens of art forms such as drama, song and dance, and folk art. Hundreds of thousands of people throughout the city participate in activities under the leadership of these artistic organizations. Mass creative activities are also very active. According to incomplete statistics, as of January this year, the masses have created six million works in various literary and artistic forms, and various districts and grassroots units have published more than 5,500 literary and art publications. In the past year or more, Guangzhou's professional drama troupes have gone down to factories, villages, and companies, performing more than 1,600 shows for workers, peasants, and soldiers by delivering performances to their doorsteps. In addition, the street poetry and painting exhibitions, recitals, propaganda evenings, and touring exhibitions held by professional cultural organizations have all penetrated into the broad masses of workers and peasants and have been warmly welcomed.

The mass amateur cultural and artistic activities and the activities held by various professional cultural groups in factories and villages have closely coordinated with various central tasks and have played a great role in promoting current production. At the same time, attention has also been paid to improvement on the basis of widespread popularization. In terms of mass cultural and artistic activities, more than 430 amateur cultural and artistic training classes and 12 amateur art schools have been held throughout the city to train mass amateur cultural and artistic cadres. The Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture, the Mass Art Center, and the cultural work agencies in various districts have all sent cadres to guide amateur art groups. At the same time, in addition to organizing professional cultural workers to help amateur authors through methods such as performances, observations, and seminars, the method of cooperation between professional authors and amateur authors has also been adopted to help amateur authors improve. In terms of professional cultural teams, attention has also been paid to identifying seedlings and outstanding works to improve the quality of creation; to rectify and reorganize artistic groups and strengthen the leadership of the Party. Vigorous efforts have also been made to organize cultural workers to go to the mountains and the countryside, go deep into the reality of production, participate in labor and grassroots work, and combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers to transform their ideology and feelings and improve their creative thinking and performance skills.

Through this series of improvement work, good results have been achieved. In the recent Guangzhou Mass Amateur Cultural and Artistic Performance, more than 150 programs were performed, dozens of which were well received by the audience. Almost all of the 113 song and dance programs in the performance were created by the masses themselves, and many of them are not only of high quality but also newly created forms. The Cantonese opera "Red Flower Ridge" depicts the heroic deeds of the Guangzhou working class holding an armed uprising under the leadership of the Communist Party. This play was created by workers from the Guangzhou Tricycle Third Sub-station and has reached a high level of ideological and artistic quality after being revised and processed by Guangzhou drama workers. Guangzhou's professional cultural workers have reaped a great harvest in ideology and creation by going deep into the reality of production and combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. For example, in the Cantonese opera field, more than 100 works reflecting the great era of the Great Leap Forward have been created, such as "Noble Occupation," which describes the noble character of Li Zhen, a female worker at the Datong Restaurant, and the importance of serving people's labor, and "Whaling," which reflects the lives and work of fishermen. These excellent plays are all good works created by authors and actors who have gone deep into reality to participate in labor and combined with the masses.

    百花齐放　丰富多彩
    广州文化工作十分活跃
    本报讯　广州市文化工作贯彻了普及与提高相结合的方针，获得很大成绩。
    广州市的文化工作自从去年大跃进以来，正确贯彻了党的文艺工作方针，出现了文化大普及的局面。全市的业余剧团、歌舞团等艺术团体共三千多个，群众自办的俱乐部、文化馆和图书馆将近四千个，群众文娱组织如幻灯组、广播组、音乐组等达到二万多个。这些群众性的文艺组织遍及工厂、公社、学校和街道，活动的内容有戏剧、歌舞、音乐、曲艺等各种艺术形式数十种。全市有几十万人在这些文艺组织领导下参加活动。群众的创作活动也很活跃，据不完全统计，截至今年1月止，群众创作各种文艺形式的作品达六百万件，各区和各基层单位出版的文艺刊物达五千五百多种。广州市的各专业剧团，一年多来下厂下乡，下连队，用送戏上门的方法，为工农兵演出了一千六百多场。此外，专业文化团体举办的街道诗画展、朗诵会、宣传晚会以及巡回展览等，均深入到广大工农群众中去，受到热烈的欢迎。
    群众业余文艺活动和各专业文化团体下厂下乡举办的活动，内容都密切配合了各项中心工作，对推动当前的生产，起了很大作用。同时，在大普及的基础上，还注意了提高的工作。在群众文艺活动方面，全市共举办了业余文艺训练班四百三十多个，业余艺术学校十二个，进行了群众业余文艺干部的培养工作。广州市文化局、群众艺术馆以及各区的文化工作机构，都派出干部对业余艺术团体进行辅导工作。同时，除了通过会演、观摩、座谈等办法，组织专业文化工作者对业余作者进行帮助外，还采用了专业作者和业余作者合作的办法，帮助业余作者提高。在专业文化队伍方面，也注意了抓苗头、抓尖端作品等，提高创作质量；对艺术团体进行整顿、改编工作，加强党的领导。还大力组织文化工作者上山下乡，深入到生产实际中去，参加劳动和基层工作，和工农兵结合，改造思想感情，提高创作思想和表演技巧。
    通过这一系列的提高工作，收到很好的效果。最近举行的广州市群众业余文艺会演中，演出的节目一百五十多个，得到观众好评的有几十个。会演中的一百一十三个歌舞节目，几乎全部是群众自己创作的，其中有不少作品不仅质量高，而且是新创造的形式。粤剧“红花岗”描写广州工人阶级在共产党领导下举行武装起义的英雄事迹。这出戏是广州三轮车三分站工人的创作，经过广州戏剧工作者的修改、加工，思想性、艺术性都达到较高的水平。广州市的专业文化工作者在深入生产实际中，和工农兵结合，在思想和创作上都得到大丰收。例如，在粤剧方面，创作了一百多部反映大跃进的伟大时代的作品，如描写大同酒家女工李珍的高尚品德和侍候人的劳动的重要意义的“崇高的职业”，和反映渔民的生活和劳动的“捕鲸记”等优秀剧目，都是作者、演员深入实际参加劳动，和群众结合，创作出来的好作品。
