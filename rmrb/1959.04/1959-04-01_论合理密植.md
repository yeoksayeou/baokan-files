Flipping through the experience summaries of high-yield and bumper harvests of various crops in 1958, every one mentions the word "dense." Rational close planting can definitely increase production; this has been proven by countless facts. The word "dense" has already been explicitly included in the fundamental law of agricultural production – the "Eight-Character Charter," reflecting a basic principle of crop cultivation. To achieve even greater harvests, we must steadfastly and comprehensively act in accordance with the "Eight-Character Charter." Among the "Eight Characters," there should be different priorities and focuses in different periods. During the sowing and planting period, the priority and focus lies on the word "dense." The preparatory work for sowing and planting must revolve around the word "dense"; various management tasks after planting must also be well adapted to the requirements of "density." In this sense, "density" is the central link to high-yield and bumper harvests of crops. Saying that "density" is the central link does not mean that it is the only important factor for high-yield and bumper harvests, nor can we say in general terms that "the denser the better." There is a story in the "Hundred Parables Sutra": Once upon a time, there was a fool who was a guest at someone else's house, and he found the food bland and tasteless. The host knew this and added some salt for him, and he found the taste very good. He thought: The taste is good because of the salt; adding a little bit of salt is so good, adding more must be even better. So, he started eating the salt directly. As a result, it was bitter and astringent. In fact, any good thing is not necessarily the more the better in all circumstances. Knowing that close planting can increase production and then blindly pursuing density, exceeding a certain limit, will instead reduce production. Here's an example: The late rice planted last year by the Meixi Youth Experimental Farm in Xinfeng County, Guangdong, under the same farming conditions, yielded 1,150 jin per mu with 360,000 seedlings per mu; 1,910 jin per mu on average with 600,000 to 800,000 seedlings per mu, achieving the highest yield; and only 700 jin per mu with 4 million seedlings per mu, despite increased technical measures. In addition, a dry direct-seeding experimental field sowed 500 jin of seeds per mu, planning to grow 10 million ears, but the seedlings could not grow and there was no harvest at all. In some other places and with some other crops, many facts learned from large-scale field production and small-area experiments can illustrate: Under certain conditions, within a certain limit, "density" is a good thing; lacking certain conditions, exceeding a certain limit, "density" will turn into a bad thing. This is precisely: Taking one step beyond the truth leads to absurdity. It is also: Too much is as bad as too little.

Of course, conditions can change. Not only are man-made conditions variable, but natural conditions can also be changed, controlled, or adapted to. Therefore, the so-called limit of close planting is not absolute, but variable. In the past, people believed that the "density limit" for wheat was 500,000 ears per mu, and the "density limit" for rice was 20,000 to 30,000 holes per mu; the planting density for other crops was also mostly set with certain "limits," believing that if such "limits" were exceeded, production could no longer be increased, and might even be reduced. In 1958, the great practice of our working people broke through these "limits." High-yield experimental wheat fields with yields of 3,000 jin or more per mu all had more than one million ears per mu. In Guangdong, when rice was planted at around 10,000 holes per mu in the past, the average yield was below 400 jin; last year, late rice was planted at around 50,000 holes per mu, and with other measures, the average yield jumped to around 1,000 jin. For others such as corn, potatoes, peanuts, beans, etc., which many people in the past believed were not suitable for close planting, reasonable increases in planting density in many areas last year, coupled with other necessary measures, have also greatly increased production. The broad masses are therefore deeply convinced: Not only must political struggle be led by the Party, but also production struggle must be led by the Party. It is precisely because the broad masses, under the leadership of the Party, have liberated their thinking and created new conditions that they have been able to break the old rules formed under the old conditions. This can be said to be a great initiative in the history of agriculture in our country, a brilliant victory of Marxism, and an indelible contribution of the working people of our country.

Breaking the old rules is a great thing. However, this does not mean that there is no longer a need for certain rules. To adapt to new conditions, new rules must be established. In order to establish new rules, we should accept all the beneficial results of past research on crop cultivation, and utilize, improve, and develop them under the new conditions. However, the erroneous ways of thinking adopted by those who established the old rules, we must not use again. They look at things from a static point of view, failing to see that conditions are changeable; they look at things from a mechanical point of view, failing to see that situations are complex and diverse; they look at things from an isolated point of view, failing to accurately grasp the interaction between close planting and other conditions; or they only see the side of mutual constraints, failing to see the side of mutual promotion. In this way, naturally they cannot correctly understand and grasp the laws of close planting. Establishing new rules must adapt to the constantly changing, different, interdependent, and mutually constraining various conditions and situations. It is certainly wrong to rigidly and inflexibly stipulate "close planting limits," and it is equally wrong to rigidly and inflexibly stipulate "minimum density"; on the other hand, it cannot be assumed that, under certain conditions, there is no certain limit to close planting, and it cannot be assumed that one can plant as densely as one subjectively desires and achieve the goal of high yield.

To correctly determine the degree of close planting, we must recognize the relationship between close planting and other production-increasing measures. For example: If the land is deeply plowed, the roots of crops can extend into deeper soil layers, and more plants can be accommodated per unit area while still allowing each plant to obtain sufficient nutrients from the soil. Deep roots can also increase the crop's ability to resist lodging. The masses say: "Deep plowing and close planting yield treasures, shallow plowing and close planting yield straw," this sentence correctly reflects the relationship between deep plowing and close planting. However, it must also be seen that deep plowing has different limits in different places, and it is not the deeper the better; in some areas, because of soil quality or terrain, plowing too deeply is actually not good. The elongation of crop roots also has a certain limit and cannot be extended indefinitely. The depth of plowing cannot but be limited by the labor and farm implements that can be used under current conditions. The mutual relationship between fertilizer, water, seed, protection, and other production-increasing measures and "density" is roughly the same. On the one hand, we must strive to strengthen these measures to make them suitable for the requirements of close planting; on the other hand, we must also see that these measures have certain limits in different places and at different times, and the degree of close planting must be adapted to the measures that are already in place and can be achieved through effort. In short, when determining close planting specifications, a comprehensive and integrated investigation and study of local conditions must be carried out. Some people blame lodging, increased pests and diseases, and low yields in a small number of experimental fields on close planting, which is certainly wrong; if all the increase in production is attributed to close planting, thus deviating from other measures and one-sidedly pursuing high-density planting in isolation, that is also incorrect.

To correctly determine the degree of close planting, we must also recognize the close relationship between close planting and natural conditions. Natural conditions such as light, wind, soil quality, terrain, temperature, humidity, etc., especially the biological characteristics of the crops themselves, all have a certain impact on the degree of close planting. Of course, it must also be seen that the characteristics of varieties can be changed under certain conditions, and some natural conditions can also be changed or controlled. Rice and wheat were generally considered to be shallow-rooted crops in the past, but under deep plowing and close planting conditions, their roots will also extend more deeply. Cotton, in some areas, has also cultivated new and improved varieties with tall stems, short branches, many bolls, and deep roots, which are suitable for close planting. In addition, planting methods can also be improved (such as rational allocation of row spacing and plant spacing, intercropping of tall-stalk crops and dwarf crops, etc.) in order to adapt to natural conditions and achieve high-yield close planting. In short, when determining close planting specifications, it is necessary to consider both the aspect that natural conditions can be changed by human power, striving to change natural conditions to meet the requirements of close planting and increased production; and also to consider the aspect that certain conditions cannot be changed at present, striving to make the degree and method of close planting adapt to natural conditions (including the crop's growth environment and the characteristics of the crop itself).

To correctly determine the degree of close planting, we must also take into account the amount of labor force, so as not to miss the farming season and without hindering the overall development of the commune economy. Generally speaking, close planting requires more labor than sparse planting. On the one hand, it must be seen that more labor can increase production, which is worthwhile; on the other hand, it must also be seen that if close planting exceeds a certain limit, a particularly large amount of labor will be required, and the problem of insufficient labor cannot be solved, resulting in reduced quality of sowing and transplanting, poor management, and delayed farming season, then the purpose of increasing production will not be achieved, and even production will be reduced. Of course, not striving to maximize subjective initiative, not implementing hard work and clever work, not striving to change technical conditions, material conditions, and natural conditions in accordance with the requirements of close planting, not striving to improve labor organization, labor management, and reform tools, and improve work efficiency, but stopping or retreating in the face of difficulties, not striving for rational close planting, and even reducing the degree of close planting that has already achieved increased production, that is also incorrect. At the same time, it must be seen that in a certain place, within a certain period, the exertion of subjective initiative has a certain limit after all. Various regions must coordinate the overall situation within this certain limit, and strive to prescribe the most appropriate various close planting specifications for different lands.

Formulating different close planting specifications under various different conditions is very important. What are specifications? They should not be rigid regulations made based on subjective imagination, but should be a reflection of the objective laws of crop growth and cultivation. Objective laws exist and can be mastered. Even if it is not possible to fully and correctly grasp them for the time being, striving to approach correctness is always possible. Of course, grasping and reflecting objective laws in very complex things is indeed not an easy task. However, this is by no means something that cannot be done. In fact, the method has long been available. The best way is to "boldly mobilize the masses and go through experiments in everything."

We must firmly believe in the majority of the masses. Countless facts have proven that the masses are able to distinguish right from wrong. As long as the masses are boldly mobilized to discuss, reasonable close planting specifications can be formulated. Binyang County in Guangxi launched a discussion on the issue of close planting at a conference of technical backbones of farmers throughout the county. As a result of the discussion, everyone realized that close planting increased production in more than 99% of cases last year, and close planting failed in less than 1%. The failures were not all due to planting too densely; some of them were due to inappropriate coordination of other measures, and some were due to natural disasters. Everyone also realized that: Although a few experimental fields with over-dense planting failed, it was not a wasted effort; since it is an experiment, there is a possibility of success and a possibility of failure, and failure can also provide valuable lessons and can help us understand how density is most reasonable. Furthermore, this high-density planting is also based on a strong desire for high-speed production increase, and the intention is very good. In their discussion, they compared the production-increasing effects of various specifications of close planting, found various close planting specifications suitable for different regions under the current conditions, and summarized the experience of solving a series of practical problems in close planting. The Chengmen People's Commune in Minhou, Fujian, also mobilized the masses to launch a major debate on close planting specifications and production increase targets. Before the debate, some people had doubts about close planting and lacked confidence in completing the production increase plan. In the debate, the commune members analyzed a large number of facts of close planting production increases in a realistic manner, educated themselves, and then put forward specific opinions on close planting specifications. The commune cadres concentrated the opinions of the masses and formulated close planting specifications suitable for the specific conditions of each piece of land in the commune. At the end of the debate, there were still four commune members who were ideologically unconvinced and insisted on the "old rules of three generations." Other commune members, on the one hand, continued to calmly present the facts and persuade them, and on the other hand, the team allocated a piece of land for them to plant, allowing them to compete with other commune members. In this way, everyone felt that they were the masters of the commune, felt happy, and were full of energy, full of confidence, striving for a yield of more than 3,000 jin per mu; at the same time, they put forward thousands of rationalization proposals to improve production, setting off a high tide of production.

Leading cadres of various localities, communes, and teams must be with the masses (including technicians) to summarize the past production experience of crops planted at various planting densities in various different conditions in the local area (including the experience of large fields and the experience of experimental fields). The masses should be allowed to compare various situations. On the one hand, it is necessary to find out under what circumstances the unit area yield is the highest; on the other hand, it is also necessary to find out the lessons of being too sparse or too dense. Of course, it is also impossible to stick to the old experience under past conditions, both respecting the old experience and inspiring the masses to see the changes in the current conditions. It is necessary to see the improvement of land fertility, material resources, and human resources, and also to see that the current degree of improvement is still limited. Only close planting specifications that have been proven to be effective through experiments are easily accepted by the masses. Those that have not been proven to be effective through experiments should not be rushed to be widely promoted. When the opinions of the masses are still very inconsistent, various small-area experiments can be done, and it is not possible to force the adoption of the same specifications. Close planting specifications that are widely promoted on a larger area are best those that have been successfully tested under the same conditions. It should be noted that some small-area experiments with special conditions, even if they are successful, should not be rashly and universally promoted if it is difficult to have the same conditions when promoting them in a large area.

People's understanding of natural laws is infinite; however, it is limited at a certain period. The limit of an individual's understanding of natural laws is relatively narrow, and the collective's understanding of natural laws is relatively broad. The mistake of conservatives who oppose close planting is the lack of a correct understanding of objective laws; the mistake of blindly close planting causing reduced production is also the lack of a correct understanding of objective laws. To have a correct understanding, there must be rich practice, so everything must go through experiments. To have a correct understanding, it is necessary to concentrate the wisdom of the masses, so it is necessary to boldly mobilize the masses.

The potential for increasing crop production is great; however, under certain conditions, it has a certain limit. Conditions can also be improved; however, in a certain period, this improvement is also limited. We must be ambitious and strive to create and use various favorable conditions, and strive for high yield and even higher yield, and we must also strive practically and down-to-earth to make plans and measures adapt to the existing possible conditions. To create the best conditions for high-yield close planting and fully utilize the existing conditions, we must work together and pool our wisdom, so we must boldly mobilize the masses. To make close planting specifications and other measures most appropriately adapt to certain conditions, we must strive for perfection, so everything must go through experiments.

As long as we boldly mobilize the masses and go through experiments in everything, close planting will definitely be rational, and it will definitely increase production.

    论合理密植
    翻遍1958年各种农作物高额丰产的经验总结，篇篇离不开“密”字。合理密植一定能够增产，这是无数事实已经证明了的。“密”字已经明文载入农业生产的根本大法——“八字宪法”，它反映了作物栽培的一条基本规律。要获得更大的丰收，就必须坚定地全面地按照“八字宪法”行事。“八字”之中，在不同的时期要有不同的重点和中心。在播种和栽植时期，重点和中心就在“密”字上。播种和栽植的准备工作，要围绕着“密”字进行；种植以后的各项管理工作，也要很好地适应“密”的要求。从这种意义上来说，“密”是农作物高产多收的中心环节。说“密”是中心环节，并不是说它是高产多收的唯一重要因素，也不能笼统地说“越密越好”。“百喻经”里有一个故事：从前有个愚人，到别人家里作客，吃饭嫌淡而无味；主人知道了，给他加了些盐，他就觉得味道很美。他想：味道好，是因为有盐；加了一点点盐就这么好，加多了一定更好。于是，他就光吃起盐来了。这样一来，又苦又涩。其实，任何美好的东西，都不是在任何情况下都是越多越好。知道了密植能增产就一味求密，超过一定的限度，反而会减产。有这样一个例子：广东新丰县梅西青年试验农场去年种的晚稻，在同样的耕作条件下，每亩三十六万苗的，亩产一千一百五十斤；每亩六十万到八十万苗的，平均亩产一千九百一十斤，产量最高；每亩四百万苗的，虽然增加了技术措施，亩产只有七百斤；此外，有一块旱直播试验田一亩播了五百斤种子，打算长出一千万穗，结果禾苗长不起来，没有一点收成。在别的一些地方和别的一些作物方面，从大田生产和小面积试验中了解到的许多事实，都可以说明：在一定条件下，在一定限度内，“密”是好事；缺少一定的条件，超过一定的限度，“密”就会变成坏事。这正是：超越真理一步，就会走向荒谬。也正是：过犹不及。
    当然，条件是会发生变化的。不只人为的条件是可变的，自然条件也能改变、控制或者适应的。因此，所谓密植的限度也不是绝对的，而是可变的。过去人们认为小麦的“密度极限”是每亩五十万穗，水稻的“密度极限”是每亩二万穴到三万穴；对其他作物的种植密度也大都定出了一定的“极限”；认为如果超过了这样的“极限”，就不能再增产，甚至要减产。1958年，我国劳动人民的伟大实践冲破了这些“极限”。亩产三千斤以上的小麦高产试验田，每亩都有一百万穗以上。广东过去水稻每亩插一万穴左右时，平均产量在四百斤以下；去年晚稻每亩插五万穴左右，配合其他措施，平均产量一跃为千斤左右。其他如玉米、薯类、花生、豆类等，过去许多人认为不适宜密植的，去年在不少地区合理地提高了种植密度以后，加上其他必要的措施，也都大大增产了。广大群众因此深切相信：不但政治斗争必须由党来领导，生产斗争也必须由党来领导。正是因为广大群众在党的领导下解放了思想，并且创造了新的条件，所以能够打破在旧的条件下形成的陈规。这可以说是我国农业史上的一次伟大的创举，是马克思主义思想的光辉胜利，也是我国劳动人民的不可磨灭的功绩。
    打破了陈规，是一件大好事。可是，这并不是说，就不再需要一定的规矩了。适应新条件，必须立新规。为了立新规，应该接受过去研究作物栽培的一切有益的成果，在新的条件下利用它、提高它、发展它。但是，立陈规的人们所采取的错误的思想方法，我们却不可再用。他们用静止的观点看事物，看不到条件是可以变化的；他们用机械的观点看事物，看不清情况是复杂多样的；他们用孤立的观点看事物，看不准密植同其他条件之间的相互作用；或者只看到互相制约的一面，看不到互相促进的一面。这样，自然不能正确地认识和掌握密植的规律。立新规，一定要适应不断变化着的、各个不相同的、互相依存而又互相制约的各种条件和各种情况。笼统地死板地规定“密植极限”固然不对，笼统地死板地规定“最低密度”也同样不对；另一方面，也不可以认为，在一定条件下，密植没有一定的限度，不可以认为主观上想怎样密植就怎样密植，就能达到高产的目的。
    要正确地确定密植的程度，必须认清密植同别的增产措施的相互关系。例如：土地翻得深，作物的根能向更深的土层中伸展，在单位面积上就能容纳较多的株数而又使每一株从土壤中得到足够的营养。根扎得深，也能增加作物抗倒伏的能力。群众说：“深耕密植得珠宝，浅耕密植得稻草”，这句话正确地反映了深耕和密植的关系。可是，也要看到深耕在不同的地方有不同的限度，并不是越深越好；在有些地区，因为土质或地势的关系，耕得过深了反而不好。作物的根的伸长，也有一定的限度，不可能无限地伸长。耕的深度也不能不受到目前条件下可能使用的劳力和农具的限制。肥、水、种、保等项增产措施同“密”的相互关系大体上也是如此。一方面，要力求加强这些措施，使它们适合密植的要求；另方面，也要看到，这些措施在不同的地方、不同的时期是有一定限度的，密植的程度又必须同已有的和经过努力能够实现的措施相适应。总之，在确定密植规格的时候，必须对当地情况全面地、综合地加以考察研究。有人把很少一部分试验田发生倒伏、病虫害多等现象和产量不高都归罪于密植，这当然是不对的；如果把增产完全归功于密植，因而脱离其他措施孤立地片面地追求高度密植，那也是不正确的。
    要正确地确定密植的程度，还必须认清密植同自然条件的密切关系。光照、风力、土质、地形、气温、湿度等等自然条件，特别是作物本身的生物学特性，对密植程度都有一定的影响。当然，也要看到品种的特性在一定条件下是可以改变的，自然条件有一些也是可以改变或控制的。稻、麦过去一般都认为是浅根作物，在深耕密植的条件下，它们的根也会较多地向深处伸长。棉花，在一些地区也培育出茎高枝短桃多根深的、适合密植的新的优良品种。此外，还可以改进种植方式（如合理配置行距株距，高秆作物和矮生作物间作，等等），以便适应自然条件，达到密植高产的目的。总之，在确定密植规格的时候，既要考虑到自然条件可以用人力改变的一面，力求改变自然条件以适应密植增产的要求；也要考虑到在目前某些条件还不能改变的一面，力求使密植的程度和方式适应自然条件（包括作物生长的环境和作物本身的特性）。
    要正确地确定密植的程度，还必须照顾到劳动力的多少，做到不误农时，而且不妨碍公社经济的全面发展。一般地说，密植比稀植需用较多的劳动力。一方面要看到：多用劳动力能多增产，这是值得的；另方面也要看到：如果密植超过了一定的限度，要用特别多的劳动力，而劳动力不足的问题不能解决，以致降低播种、插秧的质量，管理不周，耽误农时，就达不到增产的目的，甚至会减产。当然，不力求最大限度地发挥主观能动性，不实行苦干和巧干，不力求按照密植的要求改变技术条件、物质条件和自然条件，不力求改进劳动组织、劳动管理和改革工具、提高工效，而在困难面前止步或者退却，不力求合理密植、甚至降低已经获得增产效果的密植程度，那也是不对的。同时，又必须看到在一定的地方，在一定时期内，主观能动性的发挥毕竟有一定的限度。各个地区要在这一定的限度内统筹全局，力求最恰当地规定不同的土地上的各种密植规格。
    在各种不同条件下制订出不同的密植规格，是十分重要的。规格是什么？不应该是凭主观想像作出来的生硬的规定，而应该是作物的生长和培育的客观规律的反映。客观规律是存在的，是可能掌握的。即使一时不可能完全正确地掌握，力求接近正确总是可能的。当然，在十分复杂的事物中掌握和反映客观规律，的确不是易如反掌的事情。可是，这决不是没有办法做到的事情。其实，办法早就有了。最好的办法就是“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”。
    要坚定地相信群众的大多数。无数事实证明，群众是能够明辨是非的。只要放手发动群众讨论，就能制定出来合理的密植规格。广西宾阳县在全县农民技术骨干会议上就密植问题展开了一次讨论。讨论结果，大家都认识到，去年密植增产的在99％以上，密植失败的不到1％。失败的也不全是由于种得过密；其中一部分是其它措施配合得不适当，一部分是遭受了自然灾害。大家也认识到：少数种植过密的试验田虽然失败了，也不是白费了力气；既是试验，就有成功的可能也有失败的可能，失败了也可以得到宝贵的教训，可以了解密度怎样才是最合理的。再说，这种高度密植也是基于高速度增产的强烈愿望，用心是很好的。他们在讨论中把各种规格的密植的增产效果作了比较，找到了在目前条件下适合不同地区的各种密植规格，总结了解决密植中的一系列实际问题的经验。福建闽侯城门人民公社，也发动群众对密植规格、增产指标展开了一次大辩论。辩论之前，一些人对密植有怀疑，对完成增产计划缺乏信心。在辩论中，社员们实事求是地对大量的密植增产的事实作了分析，自己教育了自己，然后对密植规格提出了具体意见。公社干部集中群众的意见，制定了适合社内各片土地具体情况的密植规格。辩论到最后，仍然有四个社员思想不通，坚持“三代老规矩”。别的社员一方面继续心平气和地摆事实说服他们，一方面由队里拨出一块地给他们种，让他们同其他社员进行竞赛。这样，人人感到自己是公社的主人，心情舒畅，干劲勃发，满怀信心，力争亩产超过三千斤；同时，提出了几千条改进生产的合理化建议，掀起了生产高潮。
    各地各社各队的领导干部，都要和群众（包括技术员）在一起，总结当地过去各种种植密度的庄稼在各种不同条件下的生产经验（包括大田的经验和试验田的经验）。要让群众把各种情况加以比较。一方面，要找出哪种情况下单位面积产量最高；一方面，也要找出过稀或过密的教训。当然，也不可拘泥于过去的条件下的老经验，既要尊重老经验，也要启发群众看到目前的条件的变化。要看到地力、物力、人力的提高，也要看到目前提高的程度仍然是有限的。只有经过试验证明确实有效的密植规格，群众才容易接受。凡是没有经过试验证明确实有效的，就不要急于大量推广。在群众意见还很不一致的时候，可以作多种多样的小面积的试验，不可强求采取同一种规格。在较大面积上普遍推行的密植规格，最好是在同样的条件下经过试验成功的。应当注意，有些有特殊条件的小面积试验，即使成功了，如果在大面积推广时难以具备同样的条件，也不可贸然普遍推广。
    人们对自然规律的认识是无限的；可是，在一定时期又是有限的。个人对自然规律的认识限度是比较狭窄的，集体对自然规律的认识是比较宽广的。反对密植的保守主义者的错误是对客观规律缺乏正确的认识；盲目密植造成减产的错误也是对客观规律缺乏正确的认识。要有正确的认识，就要有丰富的实践，所以要一切经过试验。要有正确的认识，就要集中群众的智慧，所以要放手发动群众。
    农作物的增产潜力是很大的；可是，在一定条件下又是有一定的限度。条件，也是可以改善的；可是，在一定时期，这种改善也是有限度的。要雄心勃勃地力求创造和运用各种有利条件，争取高产再高产，也要实心踏地地力求使计划和措施适应现有的可能的条件。要为密植高产创造最好的条件和充分运用已有的条件，就必须群策群力，所以要放手发动群众。要使密植规格和其他措施最恰当地适应一定的条件，就必须精益求精，所以要一切经过试验。
    只要放手发动群众，一切经过试验，密植就一定能合理，也就一定能增产。
