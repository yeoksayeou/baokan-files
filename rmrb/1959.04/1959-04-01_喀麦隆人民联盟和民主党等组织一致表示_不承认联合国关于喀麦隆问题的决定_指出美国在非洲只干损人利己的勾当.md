Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 29th -- According to the "Voice of Cameroon" radio broadcast, the Cameroon People's Union and the Cameroon Democratic Party and other organizations recently held a joint meeting in Cameroon, unanimously stating that they will never recognize the decision on the Cameroon issue made by the UN General Assembly on March 14 based on the proposal of the Trusteeship Council from the United States and other countries.

The broadcast also revealed that the meeting also reached a consensus on continuing the armed struggle in Cameroon and further carrying out propaganda on the struggle for independence and unification.

The broadcast first pointed out that "the proposal of the United States and other countries illegally passed by the United Nations Trusteeship Council is an unfair resolution that completely favors French and British colonialists and completely damages the legitimate rights of the Cameroonian people."

The broadcast said: "The American proposal—which later became the decision of the Trusteeship Council—completely ignores the demands of five million Cameroonians for independence and unification for decades. The United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that the sovereignty and independence of any country are sacred and inviolable. However, the United States, one of the main member states of the United Nations, openly put forward a proposal to interfere in the internal affairs of the Cameroonian people and maintain the colonial puppet regime. This fully shows that the United States is standing on the colonialist side in the anti-colonialist upsurge."

"Voice of Cameroon" revealed in the broadcast with a large number of facts that the United States had long intended to replace the French and British colonial rule in Cameroon. It said: "The meeting unanimously agreed that the performance of the United States in the United Nations is not surprising. In fact, the United States had already intended to replace the French and British colonial rule in Cameroon as early as 1948. As early as World War II, American diplomats had repeatedly come to Cameroon to conduct activities. At that time, an official from the U.S. State Department was ordered to leave the country by the French authorities for inciting the upper echelons of Cameroon to be pro-American and anti-French. In 1948, the American Consul General in North Africa visited Cameroon. On the one hand, he held talks with Cameroonian politicians such as Mbia and Ahidjo, expressing to them that the United States would ‘inevitably support’ a Cameroon ‘not controlled by France,’ and wanted them to strive for independence. On the other hand, this American secretly talked with the French and British governors. He assured the French and British colonial authorities that the United States was concerned about the order in Cameroon as a prerequisite for large investments."

"In 1956, American forces further intervened in Cameroon. From that year on, certain monopoly capital newspapers in the United States openly advocated assisting the French and British colonialists in maintaining 'the original environment favorable to investment' in our country."

"In 1958, according to reliable sources, the United States, France and Britain reached a secret agreement on the Cameroon issue. France and Britain asked the United States to support their position in the United Nations, and the United States put forward the following conditions in exchange:
	1. Before declaring independence in 1960, the French and British armies should continue to suppress the people's forces with all their strength to form a political atmosphere conducive to Western forces. 2. After Cameroon's independence, France should strive to maintain a certain number of military bases there, and French troops should remain stationed there as a force to protect Western property. 3. The three major Western powers should jointly formulate strategic plans related to Cameroon. 4. American investment in Cameroon shall not be subject to any restrictions, and the United States can purchase shares in French and British companies in Cameroon.
The United States assured the French and British colonialists: 1. Fully support the French and British colonialists in the United Nations. 2. The United States provides the Cameroonian puppet government with a $5 million loan in the form of economic loans. 3. Once the French army encounters difficulties in supply and equipment in Cameroon, the United States guarantees supply."

The broadcast rebuked this colonialist behavior of the United States, saying, "The United States is really not doing good things in Africa, only engaging in activities that harm others and benefit itself. In Morocco and Libya, the U.S. Air Force controls vast areas of these countries and endangers their security; in Algeria and our country, 50% of the weapons used by the French colonial army are supplied by the United States. Now the United States wants to replace the French and British colonialists and carry out undemocratic colonialist conspiracies under the title of 'flag-bearer of democracy'." The broadcast finally issued a call to the five million Cameroonians, hoping that they would distinguish between right and wrong. It said, "The Cameroonian people are getting to know their friends and enemies in the struggle. We believe that the United States is no longer qualified to be a friend of our people."

### 喀麦隆人民联盟和民主党等组织一致表示  不承认联合国关于喀麦隆问题的决定  指出美国在非洲只干损人利己的勾当

    喀麦隆人民联盟和民主党等组织一致表示
    不承认联合国关于喀麦隆问题的决定
    指出美国在非洲只干损人利己的勾当
    新华社开罗29日电　据“喀麦隆的话”广播，喀麦隆人民联盟和喀麦隆民主党等组织最近在喀麦隆举行了联合会议，一致表示绝不承认联合国大会3月14日通过的托管委员会根据美国等国的提案作出的关于喀麦隆问题的决定。
    广播还透露，这次会议还就继续在喀麦隆坚持武装斗争、进一步开展关于争取独立和统一的斗争的宣传等问题取得了一致的看法。
    广播首先指出，“联合国托管委员会非法通过的美国等国的提案，是一个完全有利于法、英殖民主义者和完全损害喀麦隆人民合法权利的不公正决议”。
    广播说：“美国提案——它后来成为托管委员会的决定，完全忽视五百万喀麦隆人民几十年来对独立和统一的要求。联合国宪章规定得很清楚，任何国家的主权和独立都是神圣不可侵犯的。但是联合国的主要会员国家之一的美国，竟然公开提出一个干涉喀麦隆人民内政和维护殖民主义傀儡政权的提案，这完全说明美国在反殖民主义高潮中是站在殖民主义立场上的”。
      “喀麦隆的话”在广播中用大量事实揭露了美国早就存心要在喀麦隆代替法、英的殖民统治。它说：“会议一致认为，美国在联合国的表现是不足为奇的。其实美国早在1948年就已经存心要在喀麦隆代替法英的殖民统治。早在第二次世界大战期间，美国的外交官就曾多次来到喀麦隆进行活动。当时一位美国国务院官员因为煽动喀麦隆的上层人士亲美反法，曾被法国当局勒令出境。1948年，美国驻北非总领事访问了喀麦隆。他一方面同姆比达和阿希乔等喀麦隆政治家进行会谈，向他们表示美国
  ‘必然支持’一个‘不受法国控制’的喀麦隆，要他们争取独立。这位美国人另一方面又同法、英总督进行密谈。他向法英殖民当局保证美国关心喀麦隆的秩序，作为大量投资的先决条件。”
    “1956年，美国势力进一步插足喀麦隆。从那一年开始，美国某些垄断资本的报刊公然主张协助法英殖民者在我国保持‘对投资有利的原有环境’”。
    “1958年，根据可靠消息，美国和法英两国就喀麦隆问题达成秘密协议。法国和英国要求美国在联合国支持他们的立场，美国则提出下列交换条件：
    一、在1960年宣布独立以前，法英军队应全力继续镇压人民力量，以形成有利于西方势力的政治气氛。二、法国在喀麦隆独立后应力争在那里保持一定数量的军事基地，并由法军留守，作为西方财产的保护力量。三、西方三大国应共同制订有关喀麦隆的战略计划。四、美国在喀麦隆的投资不受任何限制，美国可以购买在喀麦隆法英各公司的股票。
    美国向法英殖民者保证：一、在联合国全力支持法英殖民主义者。二、美国以经济贷款方式向喀麦隆傀儡政府提供五百万美元贷款。三、一旦法国军队在喀麦隆发生供应和装备上的困难，美国保证供应”。
    广播斥责了美国这种殖民主义者的作为，它说，“美国在非洲实在是不干好事，只干损人利己的勾当。在摩洛哥和利比亚，美国的空军部队控制着这些国家的广大地区，并且危害它们的安全；在阿尔及利亚和我国，法国殖民军所使用的武器中有50％是美国供应的。现在美国又想要代替法英殖民主义者，在‘民主旗手’的称号下进行不民主的殖民主义阴谋”。广播最后向五百万喀麦隆人民发出号召，希望他们分清是非。它说，“喀麦隆人民是在斗争中认识自己的朋友和敌人的。我们认为美国已经没有条件做我国人民的朋友”。
