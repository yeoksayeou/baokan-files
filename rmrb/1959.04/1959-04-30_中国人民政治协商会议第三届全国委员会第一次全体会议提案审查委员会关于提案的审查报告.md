Report on the Examination of Proposals by the Proposals Examination Committee of the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
Chairman of the Proposals Examination Committee: Chen Zhengren
The proposals received by the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference include 36 items related to culture, education, science and technology, and medicine and health; 29 items related to industry, agriculture, transportation, and finance and trade; and 6 items related to religion, overseas Chinese affairs, ethnic affairs, and the work of the CPPCC, totaling 71 items.

The content of these proposals mostly concerns suggestions for further strengthening the enthusiasm for socialist construction in our country, which will play a role in promoting the continued leap forward in the country's economic construction and cultural construction in 1959. This reflects the new political outlook of all aspects of the people's democratic united front in our country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, further strengthening unity and striving for progress, on the basis of the great victory achieved in the rectification and anti-rightist movement.

The Proposals Examination Committee, adhering to the spirit of fully respecting the opinions of the original proposers and based on the principle of combining needs and possibilities, first divided the proposals into three professional review groups for research, and separately inquired about the situation from relevant departments, or consulted with the original proposers, and put forward preliminary review opinions, which were then discussed and approved by the plenary meeting of the committee. According to the results of the review, we suggest that: all those that are being handled by the conference or relevant departments, are already planned for handling, and should be handled and can be handled, should be submitted to the Standing Committee of the conference for review and handling or be recommended to the relevant departments for review and handling; all those that require careful and proper planning before handling or require preparation of conditions for gradual implementation should be submitted to the Standing Committee of the conference for research and handling or be recommended to the relevant departments for research and handling; proposals with important content, but whose specific methods still need further consultation, or involve many aspects, should be handed over to the Standing Committee of the conference to be responsible for consultation and handling in conjunction with relevant departments; proposals where the relevant actual situation still needs to be comprehensively investigated, or where the proposed methods need to be tested before it can be determined whether they can be handled, should be submitted to the Standing Committee of the conference for research or be recommended to the relevant departments for research.

Proposals received after the end of the proposal review work on April 27 are recommended to be submitted to the Standing Committee of the conference for review and handling.

Now, the "Proposals and Proposal Review Opinions (Draft)" of the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as passed by the Proposals Examination Committee, are submitted to the conference for deliberation and approval.

    这些提案的内容，大都是关于进一步加强我国社会主义建设的积极性的建议，对于争取一九五九年国家的经济建设和文化建设的继续跃进，将起着促进的作用。这反映了我国参加人民民主统一战线的各方面人士在整风、反右派运动取得了伟大胜利的基础上，在中国共产党的领导下，进一步加强团结、力争上游的新的政治面貌。
    提案审查委员会对这些提案，本着充分尊重原提案人意见的精神和根据需要与可能相结合的原则，先分成了三个专业审查组进行研究，并且分别向有关部门了解情况，或者同原提案人进行协商，提出初步审查意见，然后由委员会全体会议逐案讨论通过。根据审查结果，我们建议：凡是本会或有关部门正在办理、已在计划办理以及应当办而又可能办的，都分别交由本会常务委员会审核办理或建议有关部门审核办理；凡是需要筹划周密妥善才能办理或者需要准备条件逐步实施的，都分别交由本会常务委员会研究办理或建议有关部门研究办理；提案内容重要，但具体办法还需要进一步协商的，或者牵涉方面较多的，都交由本会常务委员会负责会同有关部门协商处理；提案有关的实际情况尚需进行全面调查，或者所提办法需要经过试验才能肯定能否办理的，都分别交由本会常务委员会研究或建议有关部门研究。
    在4月27日提案审查工作结束以后收到的提案，建议都交本会常务委员会审查处理。
    现在把提案审查委员会通过的“中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次全体会议提案和提案审查意见（草案）”向大会提出，请予审议通过。
