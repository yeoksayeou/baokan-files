Fellow Deputies:

We fully agree with and wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, and the various reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

The year 1958 was indeed an extraordinary year. The brilliance of the General Line for Socialist Construction illuminated every corner of our great motherland's cities and countryside, illuminating the hearts of all ethnic groups and people from all walks of life across the country, and transforming into a tremendous material force. Unprecedentedly brilliant achievements have been made in all aspects of industrial and agricultural production, science and technology, culture, and education. The people of the whole country are engaged in the socialist construction of the motherland with unparalleled excitement, full of energy, striving for the top, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economically, traversing in one year the road that capitalist countries have taken in several or dozens of years. Such an astonishing speed and heroic spirit not only inspires people from all walks of life across the country, but also wins the praise of friendly countries around the world. Especially since the establishment of rural people's communes in August last year, we have seen more concretely and clearly the beautiful prospects of our motherland. We are deeply educated and encouraged by this great and beautiful prospect.

We clearly realize that the socialist revolution led by the Party will not only lead the people onto a happy and fulfilling road, but will also change people's spiritual outlook with new moral standards, making people the most civilized and noble. This fully conforms to the interests of the more than 600 million people, including the three million Catholics in China. Therefore, we wholeheartedly support the leadership of the Party, resolutely take the socialist road, and feel deeply happy and proud to live in such a great era in our motherland.

The rapid quelling of the Tibetan rebellion is a great victory for the Party's policy of ethnic unity and freedom of religious belief.

However, the unification and prosperity of our motherland, and the happy and fulfilling life of our people, are extremely hated by imperialists and reactionaries. The recent Tibetan rebellion is a clear example. The original Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique, colluding with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, attempted to undermine the unification of the motherland, split national unity, restore imperialist aggression in Tibet, and preserve Tibet's backward and brutal serf system, even gathering rebel bandits to launch an armed rebellion. This seriously violated the interests of the people of all ethnic groups across the country, especially the Tibetan people. The government's order to dissolve the original Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the rebellion was a wise and timely measure, unanimously supported by the people of the whole country and the vast patriotic monks and laypeople in Tibet. As a result, the Tibetan rebellion was quickly quelled. The enemy's conspiracy not only failed to succeed, but instead promoted the consolidation of the motherland's unification and the unity between all ethnic groups, and accelerated the realization of Tibetan ethnic regional autonomy and democratic reform. This is a great victory for the Party's policy of ethnic unity and freedom of religious belief.

After suffering a shameful defeat in the Tibetan rebellion, imperialists and foreign reactionaries wailed, and even slandered our government's suppression of the rebellion as "destroying religion." The Vatican, which has consistently followed imperialism and served imperialist aggression policies, described the root cause of this rebellion as "the human nature of those whose basic rights have been damaged." What shameless slander!

Facts have proven that religious belief in New China is free and has always been protected by law. Article 88 of the Constitution explicitly stipulates that citizens of the People's Republic of China have freedom of religious belief. Chairman Mao clearly elaborated on the Party's religious policy when he received the Tibetan delegation in 1952: "The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, protecting believers and non-believers, those who believe in this religion or those who believe in other religions, and respecting their beliefs. Today, we adopt a policy of protecting religion, and we will continue to adopt a policy of protecting religion in the future." The central and local people's governments have also conscientiously implemented this policy. In the ten years since liberation, religious figures in China, like people across the country, have enjoyed equal rights politically. Clergy and believers of Chinese Catholicism have been elected as representatives to the National and local People's Congresses, and hundreds have participated in the National and local Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Believers working in government agencies, schools, and various industries hold many leadership positions, and they have never been discriminated against because of their beliefs. The same is true for those who believe in other religions. In terms of the People's Congress itself, our representatives include those who believe in religion, those who do not believe in religion, those who believe in Catholicism, those who believe in Christianity, those who believe in Buddhism, and those who believe in Islam, but we all work together in harmony, gathering together to discuss national affairs. Doesn't this fully demonstrate that all citizens of the People's Republic of China, regardless of ethnicity or religious belief, are equal in politics? In terms of religious belief, all legitimate religious life has been protected. Temples and monasteries all over the country are not only open to the public, but religious life has never been interrupted. We deeply feel that we enjoy true freedom of religious belief in New China.

The atrocities of the Tibetan rebellion are truly crimes of destroying religion and damaging human nature. They are not only traitors to the motherland, but also dregs of the religious community.

Imperialists and reactionary elements abroad in the Vatican are employing their usual tactic of confusing politics and religion, attempting to deceive and mislead religious believers. The crimes of the Tibetan rebels have slapped them in the face. The Tibetan rebels openly put forward reactionary slogans such as "Drive out the Han people" and "Tibetan independence," and launched a full-scale attack on our People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa. They killed lamas, gang-raped nuns, looted and burned temples, and plundered and harmed the Tibetan people, acting lawlessly. This is truly the crime of destroying religion and harming human nature. These rebel bandits are not only traitors to the motherland, but also dregs of the religious community. Our State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the rebellion was precisely to eliminate this group of traitorous and harmful bandits. And our People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet still implemented the religious policy of respecting the beliefs, customs, and habits of the masses and protecting lama temples in the process of suppressing the rebellion. It safeguarded the unification of the motherland and protected the religious beliefs of the Tibetan people. However, imperialists, the Vatican, and foreign reactionaries have completely reversed black and white, seeing the crimes of the rebels as upholding religion, and slandering our just action of quelling the rebellion as "destroying religion." This is indeed an extreme mockery and insult to religion, and also a slander against our country's religious policy. We resolutely oppose this despicable act of maliciously using religion to interfere in our internal affairs and undermine the unity of our country and people from all ethnic groups and walks of life. In particular, a small number of Indian expansionists, with arrogant clamoring, blatantly support the rebels, and engage in sinful activities attempting to split China, which we resolutely cannot tolerate.

Chinese Catholics must stand firm on the people's side, completely get rid of the Vatican's reactionary control, and realize the independent, autonomous, and self-run church.

Imperialists and the Vatican have consistently attempted to undermine China's unification and the unity of people from all ethnic groups and walks of life in China. Before the Tibetan rebellion, war criminal Yu Bin, on the instructions of American imperialism and the Vatican, went to Taiwan to carry out reactionary sabotage activities. As soon as Yu Bin arrived in Taiwan, he posed as the Archbishop of the Nanjing Diocese, under the guise of "traveling," "lecturing," and "visiting," under the cover of religion, to serve the US imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas," vainly attempting to place China's territory of Taiwan under US control for a long time. This is something we resolutely oppose. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. We must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. All US armed forces in the Taiwan area must withdraw. Any conspiracy to divide Chinese territory and create "two Chinas" is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people.

We want to warn imperialists and the Vatican, and also warn foreign reactionaries and Indian expansionists, that New China is a big family of unprecedented unity among the people of all ethnic groups and walks of life in China. All malicious provocations attempting to use ethnicity and religion to undermine our unity are futile. We also want to warn Yu Bin that Chinese Catholics have long torn off your religious cloak, have long seen through your ugly face. Your bankrupt political swindler's tricks can no longer deceive and mislead the awakened Chinese Catholics. Your and the US imperialists' arrogant clamoring is nothing more than the dying wail.

We Chinese Catholics must stand firm on the people's side, carry the anti-imperialist patriotic movement to the end, completely get rid of all reactionary control from the Vatican, and realize the task of an independent, autonomous, and self-run church. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party and the government, with the support and assistance of people from all walks of life, we will certainly be able to overcome all conspiracies and tricks from imperialism and the Vatican. At the same time, we are also full of infinite hope and confidence, striving to contribute more and greater strength to the great socialist construction cause, and are willing to advance bravely together with the people of the whole country to complete and overfulfill the grand plan of 1959, and to greet the tenth anniversary of our great motherland!

### 我们享有真正的信仰自由  李维光、胡文耀代表的联合发言

专栏：

    我们享有真正的信仰自由
    李维光、胡文耀代表的联合发言各位代表：
    我们对周恩来总理的政府工作报告，和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的各项报告，完全同意，并衷心拥护。
    一九五八年确是不平凡的一年，社会主义建设总路线的光辉照彻了我们伟大祖国城乡的每个角落，照亮了全国各族、各界人民的内心，化成了巨大的物质力量。工农业生产和科学技术文化教育事业各方面都取得了空前辉煌的成就。全国人民都以无比的兴奋，鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地从事于祖国的社会主义建设，一年就走了资本主义国家几年或几十年的路程。这样惊人的速度，豪迈的气魄，不但振奋着全国各界人民，而且也博得了世界上对我友好的各国人民的称赞。特别自去年八月农村人民公社的建立之后，使我们更具体、更清楚地看到了祖国的美好远景。我们深为这个伟大的美好远景所教育和鼓舞。
    我们清楚地认识到党所领导的社会主义革命，不仅将导致人民走上美满幸福的道路，而且还要以新的道德标准改变人们的精神面貌，使人们成为最文明最高尚的人。这完全符合六亿多人民的利益，包括我们中国三百万天主教徒的利益。为此，衷心拥护党的领导，坚决走社会主义道路，并深为生活在祖国这样一个伟大的时代里而感到幸福和自豪。
    西藏叛乱的迅速平息，是党的民族团结政策和宗教信仰自由政策的伟大胜利
    但是我们祖国的统一富强，和人民生活的美满幸福，是帝国主义和反动分子极端仇恨的。最近西藏叛乱事件，就是一个显明的例子。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，企图破坏祖国统一，分裂民族团结，恢复帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力，保存西藏落后、残酷的农奴制度，竟然纠集叛匪，发动武装叛乱。严重地违反了全国各族人民特别是西藏人民的利益。政府命令解散原西藏地方政府，彻底平息叛乱，是英明而又及时的措施，是全国人民和西藏广大爱国僧俗人民所一致拥护的。因而西藏叛乱迅速平息下来，敌人的阴谋不仅没有得逞，反而促进了祖国统一的巩固和各民族之间的团结，加速了西藏民族地方自治和民主改革的实现。这是党的民族团结政策和宗教信仰自由政策的一个伟大胜利。
    帝国主义和国外反动分子在西藏叛乱遭到可耻的失败后，哀鸣之余，竟诬蔑我政府平息叛乱为“摧毁宗教”，而一贯追随帝国主义、为帝国主义侵略政策服务的梵蒂冈，却把这次叛乱的根源说成是“基本权利受到损害的人类的天性”。真是无耻谰言。
    事实证明，新中国的宗教信仰是自由的，一贯受到法律保护的。宪法第八十八条明文规定了中华人民共和国公民有宗教信仰的自由，毛主席在一九五二年接见西藏致敬团时就曾明白的阐述了党的宗教政策：“共产党对宗教采取保护政策，信教的和不信教的，信这种教的或信别种教的，一律加以保护，尊重其信仰。今天对宗教采取保护政策，将来也仍然采取保护政策。”中央和各级人民政府也都认真贯彻了这一政策。解放十年来，中国各宗教界人士和全国人民一样，在政治上享受着同等的权利，中国天主教的神职人员和教徒被选为全国和各级地方人民代表大会的代表，同参加全国和各级地方政协委员会的有数百人。在政府机关、学校和各行各业中工作的教徒，有不少担负着领导职务，他们从没有因为信仰而受到歧视。信仰其他宗教的也是一样。从人民代表大会本身来说，我们的代表有信教的，有不信教的，有信天主教的，有信基督教的，有信佛教的，有信伊斯兰教的，但我们都和衷共济，聚集一堂，商讨国家大事。这不充分证明了，凡是中华人民共和国的公民，不分民族，不分宗教信仰，在政治上都是平等的吗？从宗教信仰来说，凡是正当的宗教生活，都受到了保护。全国各地的经堂寺庙不仅敞着大门任人出入，宗教生活从未间断。我们深深感到在新中国享受着真正的信仰自由。
    西藏叛乱的暴行，真正是摧毁宗教、损害天性的罪行，他们不仅是祖国的叛徒，也是宗教界的败类
    帝国主义和梵蒂冈国外反动派施展它混淆政治与宗教的惯技，企图迷惑欺骗宗教信徒，西藏叛乱分子的罪行就打了它们的嘴巴，西藏叛乱分子公开提出“赶走汉人”、“西藏独立”等反动口号，并向我驻拉萨解放军发动全面进攻。他们杀害喇嘛，轮奸僧尼，抢劫烧毁寺庙，掳掠残害藏族人民，无法无天，这才真是摧毁宗教，损害天性的罪行。这些叛匪不仅是祖国的叛徒，也是宗教界的败类。我国务院命令解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息叛乱，正是为了清除这批叛国祸教的匪徒。而我人民解放军驻西藏部队，在平息叛乱中，仍然贯彻了尊重群众信仰和风俗习惯，保护喇嘛寺庙的宗教政策。既维护了祖国的统一，也保护了藏族人民的宗教信仰。而帝国主义、梵蒂冈和国外反动派，竟颠倒黑白，把叛匪们的罪行看成是维护宗教，诬蔑我平息叛乱的正义行动是“摧毁宗教”。这确是对宗教极端的嘲笑和侮辱，也是对我国宗教政策的诬蔑。我们坚决反对这种恶毒地利用宗教干涉我国内政，破坏我国统一和各族各界人民团结的卑鄙言行。特别是一小撮印度扩张主义分子，狂妄地叫嚣，露骨地为叛乱分子撑腰，进行企图分裂中国的罪恶活动，这是我们坚决不能容忍的。
    中国天主教徒一定要站稳人民的立场，彻底摆脱梵蒂冈的反动控制，实现独立自主自办教会
    帝国主义和梵蒂冈，企图破坏中国的统一和破坏中国各族各界人民的团结是一贯的。在西藏叛乱事件之前，战犯于斌即奉了美帝国主义和梵蒂冈的意旨，前去台湾进行反动破坏活动。于斌一到台湾，就冒充着南京教区的总主教，打着“旅行”、“演讲”、“访问”的招牌，在宗教的幌子掩饰下，为美帝制造“两个中国”的阴谋效劳，妄想把中国的领土台湾长期置于美国控制之下。这是我们坚决反对的。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。我们一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖。台湾地区的美国一切武装力量必须撤走。任何割裂中国领土，制造“两个中国”的阴谋，都是中国人民绝对不能容许的。
    我们要警告帝国主义和梵蒂冈，也警告国外反动派和印度扩张主义分子，新中国是中国各族各界人民空前团结的大家庭，企图利用民族和宗教破坏我们团结的一切恶意挑拨，都是枉费心机。我们也要警告于斌，中国天主教徒，早已撕下了你的宗教外衣，早已识破了你的丑恶面目，你那一套破了产的政治骗子的手段，再也欺骗和蒙蔽不了觉悟了的中国天主教徒，你和美帝国主义者的狂妄叫嚣，只不过是垂死的哀鸣而已。
    我们中国天主教徒一定要站稳人民立场，把反帝爱国运动贯彻到底，彻底摆脱梵蒂冈的一切反动控制，实现独立自主自办教会的任务。我们深信：在党和政府的领导下，在各界人士支持帮助下，我们一定能够战胜一切来自帝国主义和梵蒂冈的阴谋诡计。同时我们也充满着无限的希望和信心，力争在伟大的社会主义建设事业上，贡献出更多更大的力量，并愿与全国人民一道为完成和超额完成一九五九年的宏伟计划，为迎接我们伟大的祖国国庆十周年，奋勇前进！
