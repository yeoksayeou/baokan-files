Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, April 23rd: Taipei news: Taipei's "China News" published a commentary on the 21st saying that the so-called Dalai Lama's statement was "ghostwritten, perhaps by Indian Prime Minister Nehru."

This English-language newspaper published in Taiwan said, "The Dalai Lama could not have written such a thing. It would not be surprising if it were later confirmed that this matter was largely directed by at least someone as important as the Indian Prime Minister himself."

    台湾“中国新闻”说
    所谓达赖声明也许是尼赫鲁代写的
    新华社香港23日电　台北消息：台北“中国新闻”在21日发表评论说，所谓达赖喇嘛的声明“别人是代笔的，也许是印度总理尼赫鲁代笔写的”。
    这家台湾出版的英文报纸说，“达赖喇嘛是写不出这种东西来的。如果以后证实这件事在很大程度上是出于至少像印度总理自己那种大人物的指使的话，那是不足为奇的”。
