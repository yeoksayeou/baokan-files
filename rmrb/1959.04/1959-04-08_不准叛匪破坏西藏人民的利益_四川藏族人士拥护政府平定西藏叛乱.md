Sichuan Tibetan Personages Support the Government in Suppressing the Tibetan Rebellion

(Our Dispatch) Awang Jiacho, Deputy Governor of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, and Xia Ke Daodeng, among others, unanimously and angrily refuted the shameless lies of the Tibetan traitorous clique and the slanderous accusations of the imperialists.

Awang Jiacho said: "Who are the destroyers of national interests, and who are the protectors of the interests of all nationalities? The facts since liberation have long made it clear to us. What we Tibetan people want is the unity of the motherland, the solidarity, prosperity, and progress of all nationalities; the Tibetan reactionary clique, however, has thrown itself into the arms of imperialism and is splitting the motherland."

Xia Ke Daodeng, who lived in Tibet for about fifteen years, said: "The Tibetan traitorous clique clamors about protecting 'national interests.' The Tibetan people are not blind or deaf, and absolutely no good Tibetan is willing to collude with imperialism and allow these people who have slaughtered them to slaughter them again. The real desire of the Tibetan people is to get rid of the dark rule of these reactionary elements and take the bright and happy socialist road." Speaking of the reactionary elements' absurd talk of "Tibetan independence," Xia Ke Daodeng said: "That is an imperialist plot. The people of all ethnic groups in our country have inseparable flesh-and-blood ties. In order to resist imperialist aggression, the Tibetan and Han people once shed blood together. Since the implementation of regional autonomy in ethnic minority areas under the leadership of the Communist Party, it is as if the Party has given us a pair of eyes, and we can see our bright future in the big family of the motherland more clearly. Take our autonomous prefecture, for example. There were no good bridges in the past, but now highways reach many remote areas. The development of industry, agriculture, culture, and education is even more boundless. Without the Party's ethnic policy, could there be all this?"

Banda Doje, a deputy to the National People's Congress and director of the Changdu Area Liberation Committee, who was passing through Chengdu, also listed the tremendous changes he had personally witnessed in the Tibetan area after liberation. He said: "The upper-level reactionary elements in Tibet vainly attempt to undermine the happy life of the Tibetan people. This is entirely their dream! What the broad masses of the Tibetan people want is to take the road of democracy and socialism. Tibet will always be an inseparable part of the motherland. Only in the big family of unity and friendship of all ethnic groups in the motherland can the Tibetan people build their own beautiful new life." (Zhou Zuyou)

    不准叛匪破坏西藏人民的利益
    四川藏族人士拥护政府平定西藏叛乱
    本报讯　四川省甘孜藏族自治州副州长阿旺嘉措、夏克刀登等一致愤怒地驳斥了西藏叛国集团的无耻谎言和帝国主义的造谣诬蔑。
    阿旺嘉措说：“谁是民族利益的破坏者，谁是保护各民族利益的人？解放以来种种事实，早叫我们看得清清楚楚。我们藏族人民要的是祖国统一，各民族团结、繁荣和进步；西藏反动集团却投靠帝国主义，分裂祖国。”
    曾在西藏居住过十五年左右的夏克刀登说：“西藏叛国集团叫嚷什么保护‘民族利益’。西藏人民不是瞎子、聋子，绝没有一个善良的西藏人愿意勾结帝国主义，叫这些残杀过自己的人再来残杀自己。西藏人民的真正愿望是摆脱这些反动分子的黑暗统治，走光明幸福的社会主义大道。”谈到反动分子叫嚷的“西藏独立”等谰言，夏克刀登说：“那是帝国主义的阴谋。我国各族人民有不可分割的血肉联系。为了抵抗帝国主义侵略，藏、汉人民曾经一起流过血。自从在共产党领导下，各民族地区实行区域自治，就好像党给了我们一双眼睛，我们更看清自己在祖国大家庭中的美好前途。就说我们自治州，过去没有一座好桥梁，现在公路却通到许多边远地方。工农业和文化教育事业的发展，更是说不尽。没有党的民族政策，难道能有这一切？”
    路过成都的全国人民代表、昌都地区解放委员会主任邦达多吉，在谈话中还列举了他亲眼看见的西藏地区解放后的巨大变化。他说：“西藏上层反动分子妄想破坏西藏人民的幸福生活，这完全是他们的梦想！西藏广大人民所要求的是走民主和社会主义的道路，西藏永远是祖国不可分割的一部分。只有在祖国各民族团结友爱的大家庭里，藏族人民才能建设起自己美好的新生活。”　（周祖佑）（附图片）
