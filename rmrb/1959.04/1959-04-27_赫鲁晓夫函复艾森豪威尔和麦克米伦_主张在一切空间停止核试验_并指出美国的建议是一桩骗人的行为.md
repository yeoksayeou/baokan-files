Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 25th: According to TASS, Moscow, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, wrote letters to U.S. President Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Macmillan on April 23rd, respectively. In the letters, he believes that Eisenhower's proposal to only cease nuclear weapons explosions in the airspace below fifty kilometers cannot solve the problem related to the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

Khrushchev said that under such circumstances, the goal of preventing the production of new, more destructive atomic weapons cannot be achieved.

Khrushchev's letters were replies to letters he received from Eisenhower and Macmillan on April 13th regarding the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing.

Eisenhower, in his letter on April 13th, had suggested that the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom agree to first cease nuclear weapons testing in the airspace below fifty kilometers. Khrushchev replied that we should not be daunted by difficulties, but must understand the necessity of concluding a treaty that stipulates the cessation of testing of any type of nuclear weapon in the atmosphere, underground, underwater, and at high altitudes.

Khrushchev pointed out that exploding nuclear weapons in the airspace above fifty kilometers can also poison the atmosphere and the ground, contaminating livestock and plants consumed by humans with radioactive fallout. Therefore, people of all countries have the right to consider the conclusion of a treaty only on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing in the airspace below fifty kilometers as a deceptive act, and people of all countries have the right to condemn this practice.

Khrushchev wrote, "I hope that the proposals put forward by the Soviet government will be understood by the American side, and I hope that we can reach an agreement on this most important and acute issue of our time. The Soviet side will make every effort to achieve an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing."

In his letter to Macmillan, Khrushchev emphasized that if the aforementioned proposal of the U.S. President, which the British Prime Minister fully supports, is adopted, then the overall goal of stopping the nuclear arms race, and even stopping the manufacture of new, more destructive atomic and hydrogen weapons, cannot be achieved, nor can the goal of preventing the poisoning of air, soil, and water by radioactive materials be attained.

Khrushchev pointed out that he held a positive attitude towards some of the views put forward by the British Prime Minister during his recent visit to Moscow, believing that these views would help to eliminate the difficulties encountered at the Geneva conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapons tests in discussing the establishment of an on-site inspection system for suspicious nuclear explosions. Khrushchev pointed out that Macmillan's suggestion to predetermine the number of inspection teams sent to the scene of incidents in each country each year could serve as a good basis for ensuring the successful resolution of the issue of stopping atomic and hydrogen weapons testing and for reaching a comprehensive agreement on this issue.

Khrushchev expressed his belief that the British Prime Minister would instruct the British representatives attending the Geneva conference to make the necessary efforts to resolve this issue based on the views he put forward in Moscow.

    赫鲁晓夫函复艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦
    主张在一切空间停止核试验
    并指出美国的建议是一桩骗人的行为
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科25日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫23日分别写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔和英国首相麦克米伦。信中认为，艾森豪威尔提出的只停止在五十公里以下的空中进行核武器爆炸的建议，是不能解决与停止核武器试验有关的问题的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在这种情况下，不允许生产新型的、毁灭性更大的原子武器的目的便无法实现。
    赫鲁晓夫的信是对艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦4月13日就停止核武器试验问题分别给他的一封信的答复。
    艾森豪威尔在他13日的信中曾经建议美、苏、英三国同意首先在五十公里以下的空中停止核武器试验。赫鲁晓夫复信说，我们不应该在困难面前裹足不前，而必须理解到有必要缔结这样一项条约，这项条约将规定停止在大气中、在地下、在水下和在高空试验任何类型的核武器。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在五十公里以上的空中爆炸核武器也可以毒化大气和地面，使牲畜和人类食用的植物受到放射性尘埃的污染。因此，各国人民有权认为，只就停止五十公里以下的空中的核武器试验缔结条约是一桩骗人的行为，各国人民有权谴责这种作法。
    赫鲁晓夫写道，我希望，苏联政府提出的建议将得到美国方面的谅解，并且希望我们之间就当代这一个最重要和最尖锐的问题达成协议。苏联方面将尽一切努力，争取达成停止核武器试验的协议。
    赫鲁晓夫在给麦克米伦的信中强调指出，如果采纳英国首相完全支持的、美国总统的上述建议，那么，停止核军备竞赛，甚至停止制造新的、毁灭性更大的原子武器和氢武器的总目标就不可能实现，而且也不可能达到防止空气、土壤和水受放射性物质的毒化的目的。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，他对英国首相最近访问莫斯科时提出的一些见解抱积极态度，他认为，这些见解有助于消除日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议，在讨论建立就地对可疑的核爆炸现象进行侦察的制度方面所产生的困难。赫鲁晓夫指出，麦克米伦提出的预先规定每年派往每个国家的出事地点侦察的侦察团的次数的建议，可以作为一个良好的基础来保证成功地解决停止原子武器和氢武器试验问题，以及就这个问题达成全面协议。
    赫鲁晓夫表示相信，英国首相将会指示参加日内瓦会议的英国代表根据他在莫斯科提出的见解，对解决这个问题作必要的努力。
