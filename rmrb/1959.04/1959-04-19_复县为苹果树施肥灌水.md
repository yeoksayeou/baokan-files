In Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, the more than two million apple trees again have full and plump flower buds this year.

In order to "ensure flowers, ensure fruit, and ensure a bumper harvest," the farmers are using various methods to accumulate fertilizer and find water sources for the fruit trees. They have now accumulated 138 million catties of pig manure, peat, burned soil, etc.; they are using well water, pit water, and dammed rivers and other water sources to irrigate more than 100,000 fruit trees, accounting for 50% of the 200,000 large-area, high-yield "satellite orchards" in the county. The Delisi Management Area of the Delisi Commune is using free-flowing water to irrigate 3,200 fruit trees. The large-area, high-yield orchard of 2,000 trees at the Delisi Farm has been irrigated twice.

The Langu Commune has installed underground bamboo tube irrigation equipment in more than 200 high-yield orchards to carry out underground channel irrigation. The County Experimental Station is using electricity to conduct water up the mountain for irrigation, and it is planned that 10,000 fruit trees will all achieve water conservancy by May 1st.

　　复县为苹果树施肥灌水
    辽宁省复县二百来万棵的苹果树，今年又是花芽充实饱满。
    农民们为了“保花、保果、保丰收”，利用各种方法给果树积肥、找水源。现在已积到猪粪、草炭、烧土等十三亿八千万斤；利用井水、坑水、堵河等水源，灌溉果树十万多棵，占全县二十万棵大面积高产卫星果园的50％。得利寺公社得利寺管理区用自流水灌溉果树三千二百棵。得利寺农场两千棵树的大面积高产果园已灌溉了两次。
    岚崮公社在二百多棵的高产果园中搞了地下竹筒灌水设备，进行暗渠灌溉。县实验站用电导水上山灌溉，一万棵果树计划在五一节全部实现水利化。　（清）
