    To Produce More and Better Steel with Converters

    During last year's Great Leap Forward, with steel as the key link, a large number of converters, both large and small, were established throughout the country. Many regions that had never produced steel before built converters and began their own steelmaking industry. Converter steelmaking has achieved unprecedented development in a very short period of time, becoming a powerful new force on the steel front. This new force played a certain role in the battle to double steel production last year. This year, converter steel production will account for a large proportion of the 18 million tons of steel. In order to ensure the completion of this year's steel production tasks, the production of converter steel must achieve an even greater leap forward than last year.

    A converter is a modern steelmaking equipment, which requires not only a complete set of production equipment, but also cooperation and coordination in all aspects, and the operating technology is also quite complex. Production will be affected if any equipment is incomplete, any raw material is insufficient, or any technology fails to meet the standards. During this period, some converters had not yet fully mastered the technology, but since we were able to produce converter steel from scratch, we will certainly be able to produce more and better converter steel from low to high. This is absolutely certain. As long as converter workers across the country continue to exert their efforts and strive for the top, no difficulty can overwhelm us. Judging from the experience exchanged at the National Converter Steelmaking Conference recently held in Shanghai by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, it is entirely possible for converter steel to leap forward at high speed. Many converter steel plants and converter workshops have recently explored many good experiences in converter steelmaking that are suitable for China's current specific conditions. After these experiences are fully promoted, a rapid development situation will emerge in converter production.

    How can converter steelmaking be quickly advanced? According to the experience exchanged at this conference, four key links must be grasped at present. The first link is to strengthen the scheduling and supply of raw materials such as pig iron. In terms of quantity, sufficient pig iron must be supplied to the converters, especially to ensure the needs of the eighteen key steel plants. In terms of quality, since desulfurization is more difficult in the converter steelmaking process, and further improving the operation of hot-blast furnaces can greatly reduce the sulfur content of pig iron, every blast furnace worker should give play to the spirit of communist cooperation, actively help converters reduce the sulfur content of raw materials, and resolutely ensure that unqualified pig iron does not leave the factory, and pig iron with excessive sulfur content is returned to the furnace for re-smelting. Each converter workshop must also do everything possible to overcome the high-sulfur barrier. Since the coke quality requirements for the cupola furnace used in the converter workshop are also relatively high, all localities should vigorously ensure that the sulfur content of coke used in the cupola furnace does not exceed 1% to 1.5%. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously engage in simple coal washing and simple coke ovens. Steelmaking enterprises should also be self-reliant when necessary and build some simple coke ovens to produce coke themselves. Other raw materials, such as ferroalloys, dolomite, and coal tar pitch, should also strive to be self-sufficient. We believe that if workers in all aspects such as blast furnaces, converters, coke ovens, and coal washing work together, cooperate closely, and support each other, coupled with the efforts of the transportation department, the raw material problem can be quickly resolved.

    The second link is to pass the technical hurdle and do everything possible to improve the output and quality of converter steel. At present, there are still some problems in the production technology of converters in various places, and the utilization coefficients vary greatly, and the qualified rates of steel also vary greatly. Generally speaking, old factories in Tangshan, Shanghai, and other places are better, while newly built converters in other regions are worse. If the utilization coefficient and qualified rate of all converters can catch up with the advanced level of the old factories, a greater leap forward can occur in converter steel production. To pass the technical hurdle for converters, a unified technical operating system must first be established, and the correct operating methods must be fixed by the system and implemented. This will ensure the continuous and rhythmic production of the converter workshop. At present, the grassroots technical strength of converter workshops in many regions is relatively weak, and short-term foreman training classes should be opened as soon as possible to concentrate on training new foremen from various factories in rotation to improve their technical level. This is also an important measure to pass the technical hurdle at present. In order to make leading cadres familiar with the technology of converter steelmaking, the method of "breakthrough at one point and promote the whole" should be promoted. Each province, city, and autonomous region can first select a factory as a pilot, and a factory can select a furnace as a pilot, concentrate its efforts, find a set of experiences, and then promote it universally.

    The third link is to seize the equipment matching work. At present, some newly built converter workshops have not yet been equipped with complete sets of equipment, so they cannot be put into production quickly, or the role they play after being put into production is not great. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has recently begun to strengthen equipment matching work. In the process of matching and improving incomplete equipment, the principle of producing while matching and producing while improving must be implemented. Efforts should be concentrated, batches should be matched, and those scattered and incomplete equipment should be concentrated, matched into complete sets, and used, so as to quickly strengthen production capacity.

    The fourth link is to vigorously grasp management work. Converter steelmaking includes several complex processes. To coordinate well between the various processes, a scientific production management system must be established. Some converter workshops also need to supplement cadres and improve institutions. In order to ensure the completion of the plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis, plan management, especially the workshop's operational plan, must be grasped.

    How to grasp these four links? The basic method is to vigorously engage in mass movements. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company built several converters in September last year. In the beginning, they also encountered many difficulties. A furnace would break after smelting only a few heats. Later, they mobilized the masses to discuss the lining quality problem that caused the short furnace life. The problem was found and solved, resulting in the extension of the furnace life to more than eighty heats. Experience in various places has proved that the broad masses of people stand at the forefront of production, deal with the steelmaking furnace every day, know the "enemy situation" best, and can also propose solutions to problems best. As long as the masses are mobilized, the improvement of converter steel production will have a solid foundation. Now that the first quarter has passed, converter steel plants and converter workshops in various places should seize the good time in the second quarter, mobilize the broad masses, pass the several hurdles of converter steel, make a rapid leap forward in converter steel production, and make the converter play a greater role in the battle for 18 million tons of steel.

    要转炉炼出又多又好的钢
    在去年以钢为纲的大跃进中，全国各地建立了数量很大的大大小小的转炉；许多过去从来没有产过钢的地区，也建起转炉，开始有了自己的炼钢工业。转炉炼钢在很短的时间内，获得了空前的发展，成为钢铁战线上的一支强大的生力军。这支生力军在去年钢产量翻一番的战斗中已经发挥了一定的作用。今年，转炉钢的产量在一千八百万吨钢中占很大比重。为了保证今年钢铁生产任务的完成，转炉钢的生产必须比去年有一个更大的跃进。
    转炉是一种现代化的炼钢设备，不仅要有一套完整的生产设备，还要有各方面的协作配合，操作技术也相当复杂。只要有一种设备不齐，有一种原料不够，有一项技术没有过关，生产就会受到影响。这一时期，部分转炉在技术上还没有完全过关，但我们既然能够从无到有地炼出转炉钢来，也就一定能够由低到高地炼出更多更好的转炉钢。这一点是完全可以肯定的。只要全国转炉工作者继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，任何困难都是难不倒我们的。从冶金工业部最近在上海召开的全国转炉炼钢会议所交流的经验来看，转炉钢高速度地跃上去是完全可能的。许多转炉钢厂和转炉车间，在最近一段时间内，已经摸索到许多适合我国当前具体条件的转炉炼钢的好经验。这些经验全面推广以后，转炉生产就会出现一个突飞猛进的局面。
    怎样才能使转炉炼钢很快跃进呢？根据这次会议交流的经验，当前必须抓紧四个环节。第一个环节是加强生铁等原料的调度供应。在数量方面，必须把足够的生铁供给转炉，特别是要保证十八个重点炼钢厂的需要。在质量方面，由于在转炉炼钢过程中脱硫比较困难，而用热风的高炉进一步改进操作，就可以大大降低生铁中硫的含量，因此，每一个高炉工作者应该发挥共产主义的协作精神，积极帮助转炉降低原料的含硫量，坚决做到不合格的生铁不出厂，含硫过高的生铁回炉重炼。各转炉车间也要千方百计攻破高硫关。由于转炉车间化铁炉所用的焦炭质量要求也比较高，各地应该大力保证化铁炉用的焦炭含硫量不超过1％到1.5％。因此，必须大搞简易洗煤、大搞简易焦炉。各炼钢企业在必要时也应自力更生，自己建立一些简易焦炉生产焦炭。其他原料如铁合金、白云石、焦油沥青等，也应力求做到自给。我们相信，如果高炉、转炉、焦炉、洗煤等各方面的工作者大家一起动手，密切协作，互相支援，再加上运输部门的努力，原料问题就能很快解决。
    第二个环节是要过好技术关，千方百计地提高转炉钢的产量和质量。目前，各地的转炉在生产技术方面还存在一些问题，利用系数高低相差很远，钢的合格率也相差很大。一般来说，唐山、上海等地的老厂比较好，其他地区新建的转炉比较差。如果所有转炉的利用系数和合格率都能赶上老厂的先进水平，转炉钢生产就可以出现一个更大的跃进。转炉要过好技术关，首先必须建立起统一的技术操作制度，把正确的操作方法用制度固定下来，贯彻执行。这样才能保证转炉车间不间断、有节奏地生产。目前，许多地区转炉车间的基层技术力量比较薄弱，应该抓紧时间大量开设短期的工长训练班，轮流集中训练各厂的新工长，提高他们的技术水平。这也是当前过好技术关的一个重要措施。为了使领导干部熟悉转炉炼钢的技术，应当推行“突破一点，推动全面”的方法。每一个省、市、自治区都可以先选择一个工厂作试点，一个厂可以选择一个炉子作试点，集中力量，摸出一套经验，然后普遍推广。
    第三个环节是抓紧设备配套工作。目前，有些新建的转炉车间，设备还没有配成套，不能很快投入生产，或者投入生产后发挥的作用不大。冶金工业部最近已经着手加强设备配套工作。在对于不齐全的设备进行配套和改进设备的过程中，必须贯彻边配套边生产、边改进边生产的方针。应该集中力量，一批批配套，对于那些分散的没有成套的设备，应该集中起来，配成整套加以使用，以便尽快壮大生产力量。
    第四个环节是要狠狠抓管理工作。转炉炼钢包括几个复杂的工序，各个工序之间要配合得好，就要建立一套科学的生产管理制度。有些转炉车间还要充实干部，健全机构。为了保证按日、按旬、按月地完成计划，要抓紧计划管理，特别是车间的作业计划。
    这四个环节怎么抓？基本的方法是大搞群众运动。石景山钢铁公司去年9月份建成了几个转炉，开始的时候也碰到不少困难，一只炉子炼几炉就坏了。后来，他们发动群众讨论造成炉龄短的炉衬质量问题，毛病找到了，问题也解决了，结果使炉龄延长到八十多炉。各地的经验证明，广大群众站在生产最前线，天天和炼钢炉打交道，最能了解“敌情”，也最能提出解决问题的办法。只要把群众发动起来，转炉钢生产的提高就有了牢靠的基础。现在第一季度已经过去了，各地转炉钢厂和转炉车间应该抓紧第二季度的大好时光，动员广大群众，过好转炉钢的几个关口，使转炉钢生产迅速来个大跃进，使转炉在为一千八百万吨钢而战中发挥出更大的威力。
