Zhou Renshan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Guo Xilan, Secretary-General, also attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Laming Yexi Chuchen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Committee Member Zhan Dong Losang Langjie presented a banner with the words "Respects to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet" to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet. Tan Guansan, Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, and Ding Sheng, Commander of a certain unit, accepted the banner on behalf of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet. A group of Tibetan Young Pioneers ran onto the stage to present flowers to the military leaders.

Laming Yexi Chuchen spoke on behalf of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, extending warm regards and respect to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet for their victory in suppressing the Lhasa rebellion. He also reported on the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercising the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet. He said: "The monks and laypeople of Tibet will continue to vigorously assist the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly suppressing the rebellion, earnestly do various support work, actively provide information to the People's Liberation Army, help transport supplies, and support the PLA wherever it goes. We will help solve any difficulties the comrades in the army have, and ensure that the People's Liberation Army smoothly completes the task of thoroughly suppressing the rebellion."

Dingjie Living Buddha, Deputy Director of the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, said in his speech: The reactionary upper class group in Tibet, under the guise of "protecting religion," maintains their feudal rule and engages in betrayal of the motherland. In fact, it is these traitors who burn temples, kill lamas, rape nuns, and plunder people's property. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet and the personnel entering Tibet have always protected temples and implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief. He said: "The religious circles in Tibet and the entire people of Tibet must fully support the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly suppressing the rebellion. We believe that the invincible People's Liberation Army will surely fulfill the wishes of the monks and laypeople of Tibet."

The representatives' speeches were constantly interrupted by warm applause.

Two soldiers from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet stepped onto the podium to express their determination, saying: All our officers and soldiers will resolutely complete the tasks entrusted to us by the Party, the state, and the people of Tibet. Our determination is: we will not stop until we thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the bandits.

Zhan Huayu, Deputy Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, spoke on behalf of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, thanking the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet for their concern and support for the army, and expressing their determination to resolutely implement the orders of the State Council, thoroughly suppress the Tibetan rebellion, and realize the hopes of the Tibetan people. Zhan Huayu described the achievements of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet in consistently implementing the policy of ethnic unity, the policy of freedom of religious belief, and helping the Tibetan people in production and construction. He said: "In carrying out the task of suppressing the rebellion, the army will strictly abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, respect the Tibetan people's freedom of religious belief and customs, and protect all patriotic and law-abiding lamas, temples, and cultural relics. At the same time, we will fully carry forward the excellent tradition of our army being both a combat force and a work team, assist local areas in carrying out various tasks, and strive to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet."

After the meeting, a performance was held to offer respects and appreciation.
