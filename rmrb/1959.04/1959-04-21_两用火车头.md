    Dual-Purpose Locomotive
    Workers at the Baotou Steel & Iron Company's Fifth Company's Repair Shop recently successfully trial-produced a native-made locomotive that can be used on both railway tracks and roads. This native-made locomotive has a boiler capacity of 1.6 cubic meters of water, and can generate more than ten atmospheres of pressure in one and a half hours. It can haul fifty tons on railway tracks, traveling at a speed of fifty kilometers per hour. On roads, it can haul more than fifteen tons, traveling at a speed of twenty kilometers per hour.

    Due to its small size and flexibility, it can also be used for mobile heating and insulation during winter construction.

    两用火车头
    包钢五公司机修厂职工，最近试制成功一种土火车头，能供平轨和公路两用。这种土火车头，锅炉盛水一点六立方公尺，一小时半可烧足十个以上的气压，在平轨上能牵引五十吨，每小时行程五十公里。在公路上能牵引十五吨以上，每小时行程二十公里。
    由于它体小灵便，在冬季施工中还可用来进行流动式的取暖保温。
