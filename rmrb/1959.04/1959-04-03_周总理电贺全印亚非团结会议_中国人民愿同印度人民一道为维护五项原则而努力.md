Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd: Premier Zhou Enlai sent a telegram on the 1st to congratulate the All-India Asian-African Solidarity Conference, which opens today in Calcutta. The telegram reads as follows: To Mrs. Rameshvari Nehru, Chairperson of the Indian Asian-African Solidarity Committee, for transfer to the All-India Asian-African Solidarity Conference:

    On the occasion of the convening of the All-India Asian-African Solidarity Conference, I, on behalf of the Chinese Government and people, extend warm congratulations to the conference.

    The Five Principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, jointly advocated by the Chinese and Indian governments, have become the universally accepted norms for handling international relations by peace-loving countries and peoples around the world. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the Indian people to uphold the Five Principles, to uphold the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, to further advance the anti-colonialist struggle in Asia and Africa, to completely smash the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism, and to further consolidate and enhance the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indian peoples.

    I wish the conference success.

    Zhou Enlai
