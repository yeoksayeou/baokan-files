From our Wuhan dispatch on April 10th: The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's system of having leading cadres take turns working as ordinary workers for one month has yielded significant results.

Currently, Wuhan Iron and Steel has thirty-one Party secretaries and committee members of factories and engineering companies, fifty-seven section chiefs, and three hundred and seventy-four engineering and technical personnel and general cadres who have left their posts for more than a month to work in workshops and construction sites. Because they eat, live, and work alongside the workers, they have established closer ties with the masses than in the past, gained a more practical and concrete understanding of production and construction, and are better able to identify weak links and tap production potential.

The construction of the open-hearth furnace is underway on a large scale. After Pei Dongxu, the deputy director of the steelmaking plant, worked as a concrete worker on the open-hearth furnace construction site in January, he discovered problems with the concrete pouring for the molten iron furnace foundation. He immediately helped the construction site leaders arrange the labor organization, changing from two shifts to three shifts day and night to ensure the quality of the foundation. The large rolling mill and primary rolling mill of Wuhan Iron and Steel will be put into production this year, and the task of leveling earthwork in the rolling area is heavy, but the plan was poorly completed in January and February. Gao Xiaosheng, the deputy manager of the earthwork company, went to the tractor on the rolling area construction site as an apprentice. In discussing the plan with the workers, he found ways to improve production by changing from two shifts to three shifts day and night and conditionally changing the heavy vehicles from third gear to fourth gear, which enabled more than twenty tractors to shovel and transport an additional 1,600 cubic meters of earth per day. Zhang Yude, the deputy manager of the industrial installation company, participated in the installation of the blast furnace shell and found that the ninth ring of the furnace shell and the tray could not be supplied on schedule. He immediately studied the problem with the workers in his group and wrote a big-character poster to the riveting and welding factory, asking for their assistance. The workers in the riveting and welding factory immediately rushed to make these components and sent them to the construction site, ensuring the rapid installation of the blast furnace.

Having the main leaders of the enterprise work as workers also enables them to gain insight into many problems in enterprise management and the masses' living welfare from a worker's perspective and solve them. Yu Yaohua, the Party secretary of the steelmaking plant, walked into the workers' shed with his luggage and found that the shed was relatively simple and very unclean. He immediately took the lead in cleaning it and notified the administrative section to repair it. In less than two days, workers who were unwilling to live in the shed in the past saw that the shed had a new look and moved in.

Having the main leaders of the enterprise work as workers further strengthens the relationship between cadres and the masses and encourages the enthusiasm of the masses for labor. When comrades such as Gao Xiaosheng, Yu Yaohua, and Pei Dongxu first went to work, the workers were very happy on the one hand, but also a little restrained on the other. After a period of joint labor, the workers were willing to talk to them about anything in their hearts, whether it was family matters or work issues. Sharing quilts at night and asking about hunger and cold became intimate friends.

The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation began implementing the system of having leading cadres take turns working as ordinary workers in November last year, starting with the steelmaking plant. Before this, Wuhan Iron and Steel had universally implemented various methods such as having young intellectuals work as workers for one year and having on-the-job cadres work half a day a week and grassroots cadres work alongside workers. These methods are still being implemented this year.

From our Wuhan dispatch on April 10th: While the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's Second Engineering Company has cadres taking turns working as workers, it also draws experienced old workers in batches to participate in departmental work to help leaders improve enterprise management.

The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's Second Engineering Company began drawing old workers to participate in departmental work in November last year. They drew a total of sixteen experienced and politically conscious old workers (including painters, steelworkers, masons, carpenters, and other types of workers) in the first batch to work in the company's construction budget section, technical section, technical supply section, administrative welfare section, as well as the Party committee's propaganda department and the trade union. They participated in the specific work of each unit and also served as consultants to the departments. Now, the first batch of workers has returned to their original production posts, and the second batch of twelve workers has been assigned to various departments to work.

Practice has proven that rotating old workers to participate in the company's management work has the following benefits:

1.	Closer contact between management cadres and workers. In the past, some workers misunderstood that there was not much to do in management work because they did not understand it. After participating in management work, they realized that departmental work is an important part of enterprise management and that it is not easy to do. Carpenter Gu Longyao said: "I didn't know what role the construction management section's engineering budget played in the past, but after participating in the work, I realized its importance. If the engineering budget is not balanced, the construction plan will not be balanced, so management work is as important as workers' labor."

2.	Helping departmental cadres overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism and improve leadership. For example, in statistical work, some construction site statisticians said they were too idle and had nothing to do in the past; the statisticians in the construction budget section only summarized the construction site statistical reports. After painter Yu Shuang participated in the statistical work, he immediately discovered this problem and proposed that the construction section's statisticians should manage the construction site statisticians and provide them with business guidance. The department adopted his suggestion and immediately convened the construction site statisticians to study how to improve the quality of statistics. As a result, it was not that there was nothing to do, but that a lot of in-depth and detailed work had to be done.

3.	Workers learned the knowledge of managing enterprises, creating conditions for selecting cadres from the masses. (Attached picture)

### 在劳动中找到生产潜力　武钢领导干部当工人生产跃进思想丰收　部分工人参加企业管理改进了科室工作

　　在劳动中找到生产潜力
　　武钢领导干部当工人生产跃进思想丰收
　　部分工人参加企业管理改进了科室工作
    本报武汉10日电　武汉钢铁公司普遍实行领导干部轮流下放当工人一个月的制度以来，已获得显著效果。
    现在，武钢已有工厂和工程公司的党委书记和委员三十一人、科长五十七人、工程技术人员和一般干部三百七十四人，离职一个多月或更多时间，到车间和工地当工人。由于他们和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，因而和群众建立了比过去更亲密的联系，对生产施工中的情况掌握得更加切实、具体，同时也更易发现薄弱环节、挖掘生产潜力。
    平炉土建工程正在大规模兴工，炼钢厂副厂长裴东旭在1月份到平炉工地当混凝土工人之后，发现混铁炉基础的混凝土浇灌有问题，他就立即帮助工地领导安排劳动组织，由两班改为三班日夜抢救，保证了基础的质量。武钢的大型轧钢厂和初轧厂都要在今年投入生产，轧钢区的土方平整任务很大，而1、2月份又完成计划很差。土方公司施工副经理高晓声就到轧钢区工地的拖拉机上当徒工，在和工人一起讨论计划中，找到了由两班改为日夜三班作业和有条件地把重车开三档改为四档等提高生产的办法，使二十多台拖拉机每天多铲运一千六百多方土。工业安装公司施工副经理张裕德参加高炉炉壳安装工程，发现第九圈炉壳和托盘不能按进度供应，立即和本小组的工人一起研究，写了张大字报送到铆焊厂，请他们援助，铆焊厂工人立即把这些构件赶制出来，送到工地，保证了高炉快速安装。
    企业的主要负责人下去当工人，还使他们能够从一个工人的角度洞察企业管理和群众生活福利方面的许多问题，并加以解决。炼钢厂党委书记于耀华背着行李走进工棚，见工棚比较简陋而且很不清洁，他马上带头打扫，并通知行政科修理。不到两天，过去不愿住工棚的工人，看见工棚面貌一新，便都搬来了。
    企业主要负责人下去当工人，更加密切干群关系、鼓舞群众劳动热情。高晓声、于耀华、裴东旭等同志才下去劳动时，工人一方面很高兴，一方面也还有些拘束；经过一段时间的共同劳动，工人们有什么心里话，不管是家常事或工作上的问题都愿找他们谈。夜里睡觉互相盖被子，问饥问寒，成了知心朋友。
    武钢实行领导干部轮流下放当工人的办法，是去年11月从炼钢厂开始的。在这以前，武钢已普遍实行了青年知识分子下放当一年工人和在职干部每周劳动半天、基层干部跟班劳动等多种办法。这些办法今年仍在实行。
    本报武汉10日电　武钢第二工程公司在干部轮流下放当工人的同时，分批抽调老工人参加科室工作，帮助领导改进企业管理。
    武钢第二工程公司抽调老工人参加科室工作是从去年11月开始的。他们第一批共抽调了十六名经验丰富、政治觉悟高的老工人（包括油漆工、钢筋工、泥工、木工等各个工种），到公司施工预算科、技术科、技术供应科、行政福利科以及党委宣传部、工会等单位工作。他们既参加各单位的具体工作，又起着科室顾问的作用。现在，第一批工人已经返回原生产岗位，第二批十二个工人又被分配到各个科室就职。
    经过这段实践证明，这样轮流抽调老工人参加公司管理工作，有以下几个好处：
    一、密切了管理干部和工人的联系。过去，有些工人由于对管理工作不了解，误认为管理工作没有多少事儿。他们参加管理工作以后，便认识到科室工作是企业管理的重要组成部分，并且也不容易作。木工顾龙尧说：“过去不知道施工管理科的工程预算起什么作用，参加工作后知道了它的重要性。工程预算不平衡，施工计划就不平衡，所以管理工作和工人劳动同样重要。”
    二、帮助科室干部克服官僚主义、主观主义，改进领导工作。例如在统计工作方面，过去有些工地统计员说自己太空闲，没事干；施工预算科里的统计员也是只把工地统计报表汇总一下就完了。油漆工余双参加统计工作后，立即发现这一问题，提出施工科的统计员应该管理工地统计员，对他们进行业务指导。科里采纳了他的意见，立即召集工地统计员研究如何提高统计质量，结果不是没有事儿干，而是要做许多深入细致的工作。
    三、工人学会了管理企业的知识，为从群众中选拔干部创造了条件。（附图片）
