Report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 Draft National Budget
Delivered on April 21, 1959, at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress
Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance

Fellow Deputies:

Now, on behalf of the State Council, I present the report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 Draft National Budget for your review.

(I) 1958 National Final Accounts

The execution of the 1958 National Fiscal Budget resulted in both income and expenditure greatly exceeding original expectations. The scale of revenue and expenditure and the speed of growth far surpassed any previous year. This is the victory of the Chinese people's year-long struggle. The foundation of this victory is the unprecedented and great leap forward in the national economy achieved by the Chinese people in 1958 under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, implementing the general line for socialist construction. This victory further eloquently proves the superiority and great vitality of the socialist system.

Now, I will discuss the specific details of the 1958 National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Final Accounts.

In 1958, the national revenue was 41.86 billion yuan, equivalent to 126.1 percent of the original budget of 33.2 billion yuan. The fiscal revenue this year increased by 10.85 billion yuan compared to the previous year, while during the First Five-Year Plan period, 1957 only increased by 13.4 billion yuan compared to 1952. The fiscal revenue this year grew by 35 percent compared to the previous year's fiscal revenue of 31.01 billion yuan, while the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period was only 12 percent, and even the fastest growth years of 1953 and 1956 were only 23 percent and 16 percent respectively. In the 1958 revenue final accounts, various taxes amounted to 18.74 billion yuan, 113.3 percent of the original budget; enterprise and institutional income was 22.02 billion yuan, 139.3 percent of the original budget; public debt income was 790 million yuan, 126.4 percent of the original budget; and other income was 310 million yuan, 140.7 percent of the original budget.

In 1958, the expenditure was 40.96 billion yuan, equivalent to 123.4 percent of the original budget of 33.2 billion yuan. Compared to the 1957 expenditure of 30.42 billion yuan, the 1958 expenditure increased by 10.54 billion yuan, a growth of 35 percent. In the 1958 expenditure final accounts, economic construction expenses were 26.27 billion yuan, 149.7 percent of the original budget; social, cultural, and educational expenses were 4.35 billion yuan, 88.9 percent of the original budget; national defense expenses were 5 billion yuan, 100 percent of the original budget; and administrative management expenses were 2.27 billion yuan, 113.7 percent of the original budget. In addition, there were expenditures of 1.18 billion yuan for repaying domestic and foreign debts and foreign aid, 240 million yuan for other expenditures, and 1.65 billion yuan allocated to banks as funds for issuing loans. The part of the 1958 expenditure that exceeded the budget was mainly used to expand the scale of capital construction. In 1958, the total amount of the above-mentioned economic, social, cultural, and other expenditures used for capital construction investment was 21.4 billion yuan, an increase of 70 percent compared to the 12.6 billion yuan of the previous year. The capital construction investment raised by various localities and departments outside the budget is not included in this figure. Due to careful calculations, reduced project costs, and doing more with the same amount of funds, the actual amount of capital construction work completed in 1958 was greater than what could have been completed in the past with the same investment. In 1958, cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings achieved significant development; the reason why these areas did not use up all their funds was mainly due to the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor, and the policy of diligence and thrift in education and running undertakings. The reason why administrative management expenses exceeded the original budget in 1958 was mainly because the scale of national construction undertakings greatly exceeded the original plan.

In 1958, the national fiscal revenue and expenditure offset each other, resulting in a surplus of 900 million yuan. This is the surplus belonging to the local budgets, which will be carried over to 1959 for continued use by the localities.

Due to fiscal revenue being greater than expenditure, and due to the increase in deposits of various enterprises and institutions and people's savings, the industrial loans, agricultural loans, and commercial loans issued by the People's Bank of China this year all increased significantly compared to the previous year. The issuance of these loans strongly supported the development of industrial and agricultural production and the expansion of commodity circulation. Due to the needs of the development of industrial and agricultural production and the expansion of urban and rural commodity circulation, the amount of currency in circulation in the market increased accordingly. At the same time, the national inventory of commodities and materials also increased considerably. Overall, the situation on the national economic and financial front in 1958 was very good.

The leadership of the Party and putting politics in command are the fundamental guarantees for the leap forward in production and the economic upsurge in 1958. Without the mass rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, without the Party's general line for socialist construction, and without the widespread and in-depth ideological education in socialism and communism, it would have been unthinkable to achieve the victory on the economic and financial front in 1958. At the same time, our leap forward is also inseparable from the strong assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries.

1958 was a year of great development of the Party's mass line. On all fronts of industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, post and telecommunications, and culture and education, vigorous mass movements were launched, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties, and the same was true for financial work. At the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress in February 1958, based on Chairman Mao's spirit of handling the ten major relationships and mobilizing all positive factors, we proposed methods to improve the fiscal management system, improve the enterprise financial management system, and improve agricultural loan management. Subsequently, we formulated methods to improve the tax management system and improve the financial management system for capital construction, etc. These methods are conducive to better combining the unified plan with the principle of adapting to local conditions, and combining centralized leadership with mass movements, thereby creating conditions for striving to increase revenue and save expenditure. For example, after the implementation of the capital construction investment contract system, the employees of many enterprises expanded the scale of capital construction under the condition that the investment did not increase. Instead of relying on a few people to manage finances, we rely on relevant units and the broad masses to manage finances; instead of simply circling numbers on reports, we go deep into enterprises and institutions to conduct financial accounting and fiscal supervision with the masses. This has brought about a new and rapid development in our financial work.

The reason why the national finance achieved great achievements in 1958, in the final analysis, came from the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production. In 1958, approximately 700 above-quota factories and mines were completed and partially completed and put into production, which is more than 160 more than the factories and mines that were fully put into production and partially put into production during the First Five-Year Plan period. The small and medium-sized factories and mines below the quota and the small enterprises run by the people's communes are even more like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. This year, the total national industrial output value increased by 66 percent compared to the previous year, and the total agricultural output value increased by 64 percent compared to the previous year. This year, the labor productivity of state-owned enterprises greatly increased, and the product cost of industrial enterprises directly under the central industrial ministries decreased by 12.5 percent compared to the previous year. All of the above, of course, correspondingly increased the national fiscal revenue. This year, the financial departments also repeatedly increased the funds for production and construction in the process of budget execution based on the new situation of continuous revenue growth. Production development enriched fiscal revenue; the growth of fiscal revenue, in turn, promoted the development of the national economy. Income and expenditure promote each other; only when business is booming can financial resources be abundant. It can be seen that the irrefutable truth of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" will never be outdated.

The people can clearly see the great leap forward in our national economy and the huge increase in fiscal revenue and expenditure, and they are delighted and encouraged. Our friends are also happy for our achievements. No matter how the imperialists and their echoers slander and attack us, they cannot deny the fact of our great leap forward. Some well-meaning people doubt whether the fiscal revenue is growing so fast because the burden on the people has been increased. Such doubts are understandable because the great leap forward in 1958 was unprecedented.

People's understanding often lags behind reality for such new things. The reason why the fiscal revenue grew so fast in 1958 is definitely not because the burden on the people has been increased. As everyone knows, whether the burden on the people is increased mainly depends on whether the increase in taxes exceeds the speed of production growth and people's income growth, and it depends on whether market prices are stable. Among the 41.86 billion yuan of national fiscal revenue in 1958, the taxes and profits paid by state-owned enterprises and institutions accounted for 83.9 percent, while the payments from rural people's communes only accounted for 13.7 percent, and the payments from other aspects accounted for 2.4 percent. This year, the total agricultural tax collected by the state from rural areas was only 3.26 billion yuan, an increase of 290 million yuan compared to the collection figure of 2.97 billion yuan in the previous year; this year, the state collected industrial and commercial taxes in rural areas, which increased to 2.15 billion yuan due to the development of rural industry and commerce and agricultural and sideline industries and the increase in farmers' purchasing power, an increase of 350 million yuan compared to the collection figure of 1.8 billion yuan in the previous year; this year, the state issued public bonds and other income of 320 million yuan in rural areas, an increase of 30 million yuan compared to the 290 million yuan in the previous year; the total of these three items is 5.73 billion yuan, plus the 440 million yuan of agricultural tax surcharges collected by various localities outside the budget, totaling 6.17 billion yuan. The proportion of farmers' burden in the total agricultural output value decreased from 10 percent in 1957 to 7 percent in 1958. That is to say, although agricultural and sideline production had a great development in 1958, the state still implemented the policy of stabilizing the burden on farmers, and the burden on farmers was relatively reduced, not increased. Market prices in our country were stable in 1958. From the perspective of market supply, since the autumn of 1958, some non-staple foods and certain daily industrial products in cities have experienced a situation where supply falls short of demand and is slightly tight. This is mainly because the employment surface in cities has expanded, the number of employees has increased, and the demand has increased. This year, many new enterprises and institutions were established across the country. On average, the number of employees increased by approximately 8 million compared to the previous year, equivalent to one-third of the original number of employees, and the demand for means of production and means of subsistence greatly increased. At the same time, after the communization of the people's communes, the lives of farmers have improved due to the establishment of public canteens and other public welfare undertakings by the communes, and the consumption of non-staple foods in rural areas has increased, so the part supplied to cities has relatively decreased; due to the increase in farmers' income, the demand for daily industrial products in rural areas has also increased. Therefore, although the industrial and agricultural products increased in 1958 and the quantity of market commodity supply expanded, it still could not keep up with the growth in demand from all aspects. Of course, there are also some shortcomings in commodity allocation, transportation, and other aspects. We are taking necessary measures to gradually improve them. In a country like ours with a large population and a large demand, in such a great leap forward in the national economy and such a huge social change as the communization of the people's communes, it is difficult to completely avoid some temporary difficulties in economic life. However, despite some situations where supply falls short of demand, we have still maintained the stability of market prices. The people of our country deeply understand that in order to rapidly change the backward situation of our economy and culture, we must be diligent and thrifty and overcome some temporary difficulties. As the economy develops and undertakings advance, these difficulties can be resolved. In our socialist country, fiscal revenue mainly comes from the state-owned economy, and increasing revenue relies on the development of the state-owned economy and the collective economy, not on increasing the burden on the people; it relies on the development of production, not on the issuance of currency. Ensuring the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure on the basis of developing production is an important principle that we have always followed in our national financial and economic work. This is the reason why our country has always been able to maintain the stability of the currency value and the stability of market prices. In our socialist country, the fundamental purpose of developing production is to maximize the satisfaction of the people's ever-growing material and cultural needs; and the continuous growth of needs, in turn, promotes the continuous development of production. The broad masses of workers and people produce for the construction of socialism and their own happiness, so they can engage in labor with full enthusiasm. This is the reason why our country can develop production at a high speed and increase income.

(II) Arrangements for the 1959 National Budget

1959 is the second year of our country's Second Five-Year Plan. In 1959, the people of our country must, in accordance with the Party's general line for socialist construction, realize the continued great leap forward in the national economy on the basis of the great victories and rich experiences gained in the previous year.

Adapting to this situation, the Draft National Budget for 1959 that has now been compiled is a budget that taps potential and supports a comprehensive leap forward; it is a budget that implements the spirit of "the whole country as one chess game" and mobilizes the positive factors of all parties under the principle of centralized leadership; it is also a budget that is both proactive and reliable.

The 1959 National Budget projects revenue of 52.001 billion yuan and expenditure of 52.001 billion yuan, achieving a balance between revenue and expenditure. Compared with the 1958 final accounts, revenue increased by 10.15 billion yuan, a growth of 24.2 percent; expenditure increased by 11.005 billion yuan, a growth of 27 percent.

The growth of the 1959 budget revenue has fully considered objective possibilities. According to the draft plan, the total industrial output value in 1959 will increase by 41 percent compared to the previous year, and the total agricultural output value will increase by 39 percent compared to the previous year. The growth of fiscal revenue is basically adapted to the growth of the above-mentioned national economic indicators. We have considered some good conditions for increasing fiscal revenue in 1959, such as: First, light industrial production mainly relies on agricultural products harvested in the previous year as raw materials. The unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture in 1958 provided light industrial production in 1959 with conditions that are much better than in the previous year, and light industrial production can provide more accumulation for the country; Second, the factories and mines that were put into production in large quantities in 1958 will play a greater role in 1959, and a number of newly built factories and mines will also be put into production in 1959, the equipment has increased, and the scale of production is even larger; Third, also because after 1958, we began to have the experience of the great leap forward, the experience of launching mass movements in production and construction, and our people's communes, after the rectification work last winter and this spring, will further exert their superiority; and so on. Therefore, although the growth rate of budget revenue is very large, it is based on facts and can be completed or even exceeded through hard work.

The various types of income in the 1959 National Budget are as follows:

1.  Various taxes are 19.9 billion yuan, accounting for 38.3 percent of the total budget revenue, an increase of 6.2 percent compared to the previous year. Among them, industrial and commercial taxes are 15.2 billion yuan, an increase of 7.2 percent compared to the previous year; agricultural tax is 3.3 billion yuan, an increase of 1.3 percent compared to the previous year.

2.  Enterprise and institutional income is 31.8 billion yuan, accounting for 61.1 percent of the total budget revenue, an increase of 44.4 percent compared to the previous year.

3.  Other income is 310 million yuan, accounting for 0.6 percent of the total budget revenue, which is the same as the previous year.

With the approval of the Standing Committee of the First National People's Congress in June 1958, the issuance of national economic construction bonds will be discontinued from 1959. At the same time, the state promulgated the "Regulations on Local Economic Construction Bonds of the People's Republic of China," stipulating that provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government may issue relatively short-term local public bonds based on local conditions. However, with the exception of a few provinces, all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have decided not to issue public bonds this year for the time being.

If the 1959 National Budget revenue is divided according to the payments of different economic components, the payments of state-owned enterprises owned by the whole people will be 45.73 billion yuan, an increase of 10.6 billion yuan compared to the previous year, accounting for 87.9 percent of the total budget revenue; the payments of rural people's communes will be 5.87 billion yuan, an increase of 140 million yuan compared to the previous year, accounting for 11.3 percent of the total budget revenue; the payments from other aspects will be 410 million yuan, a decrease of 590 million yuan compared to the previous year, accounting for 0.8 percent of the total budget revenue. It can be seen that the growth of the 1959 budget revenue will mainly rely on the development of the state-owned economy and the increase in the part turned over by state-owned enterprises, and the burden on rural people's communes will basically remain at the same level as the previous year. The state will collect 3.3 billion yuan in agricultural tax in 1959, which is roughly the same as the collection figure of the previous year; the rural industrial and commercial tax will be 2.45 billion yuan, an increase of 300 million yuan compared to the previous year, which is calculated based on the collection situation of the previous year with reference to this year's planned output value; other rural income will be 120 million yuan, a decrease of 200 million yuan compared to the previous year, because most areas will not issue public bonds this year. In addition, there will also be 440 million yuan of agricultural tax surcharges in 1959, which is also the same as the figure of the previous year. The proportion of various burdens of rural people's communes in the total agricultural output value was 7 percent in 1958 and will decrease to 5.2 percent in 1959. The various types of expenditures in the 1959 National Budget are as follows:

1.  Economic construction expenses are 31.7 billion yuan, accounting for 61 percent of the total budget expenditure, an increase of 25.9 percent compared to the previous year.

2.  Social, cultural, and educational expenses are 5.73 billion yuan, accounting for 11 percent of the total budget expenditure, an increase of 32 percent compared to the previous year.

3.  National defense expenses are 5.8 billion yuan, accounting for 11.2 percent of the total budget expenditure, an increase of 16 percent compared to the previous year.

4.  Administrative management expenses are 2.69 billion yuan, accounting for 5.2 percent of the total budget expenditure, an increase of 18.3 percent compared to the previous year.

5.  Debt expenditure is 1.1 billion yuan, accounting for 2 percent of the total budget expenditure, an increase of 21.7 percent compared to the previous year.

6.  Foreign aid expenditure is 600 million yuan, accounting for 1.2 percent of the total budget expenditure, an increase of 118 percent compared to the previous year.

7.  Other expenditures are 270 million yuan, accounting for 0.5 percent of the total budget expenditure, an increase of 13.3 percent compared to the previous year.

8.  An additional 3.17 billion yuan will be allocated to bank credit funds, accounting for 6.1 percent of the total budget expenditure.

9.  The total reserve fund is 950 million yuan, accounting for 1.8 percent of the total budget expenditure.

If the above-mentioned 1959 National Budget expenditures are divided according to the central budget and the local budget, the central budget is 27.91 billion yuan, accounting for 53.7 percent of the total budget expenditure; the local budget is 24.1 billion yuan, accounting for 46.3 percent of the total budget expenditure.

Regarding the arrangement of the 1959 National Budget expenditures, the following points need to be explained:

(1) In the 1959 National Budget expenditures, the proportion of economic construction expenses and social, cultural, and educational expenses is 72 percent, which remains at the same level as in 1958; the proportion of national defense expenses and administrative expenses has been further reduced, from 17.8 percent in 1958 to 16.4 percent in 1959. The proportion of expenses required by state organs has been further reduced.

(2) In the 1959 National Budget expenditures, the investment used for capital construction is a total of 27 billion yuan, an increase of 5.6 billion yuan compared to the 21.4 billion yuan of the previous year, a growth of 26 percent. Capital construction investment has increased rapidly in the past two years. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the capital construction investment generally accounted for 30 to 40 percent of the total national budget expenditure each year, only accounting for 45.7 percent in 1956, while it increased to 52 percent in 1958, and it is still 52 percent in 1959. In addition to the capital construction investment listed in the budget for 1959, there will also be capital construction investment raised by various localities and departments themselves. In order to give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of various construction units and encourage them to be careful and economical within the established investment scope and spend less money and do more things. The capital construction investment contract system will continue to be implemented in 1959, that is: on the premise of ensuring project quality, ensuring that production capacity is not reduced, not delaying the completion date, not exceeding the total investment amount, and not increasing the proportion of non-productive construction, the capital construction investment stipulated by the annual economic plan and the national budget will be handed over to the relevant construction units for unified management and contracted use, so as to effectively give play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees of the construction units. Of course, this year, we will also make some supplements to the contract method in certain aspects based on the experience in actual implementation.

(3) In 1959, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the investment in the people's communes was increased by 1 billion yuan in the economic construction expenditure, as the state's financial subsidy to the people's communes. This fund will mainly be distributed to the people's communes and production teams with poor economic conditions to help them develop production, so that they can catch up with the level of relatively wealthy communes in a short period of time. Of course, the funds allocated by the state are limited, and the development of the economy of the people's communes mainly relies on their own accumulation. As Chairman Mao said, all economically backward communes and production teams should, like the Wang Guofan cooperative of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, which was called a "poor stick" cooperative, rely on their own efforts and work hard with their own hands to change the current economically backward situation.

(4) In the 1959 National Budget expenditures, an additional 3.17 billion yuan was allocated to bank credit funds. In the past few years, the working capital needed by state-owned enterprises was partly allocated from the budget and partly borrowed from banks. In order to timely guarantee the working capital needed by enterprises and overcome the phenomenon of disconnection, duplication, and complicated procedures that were prone to occur when funds were supplied separately in the past, it has been stipulated that from 1959, all the working capital needed by state-owned enterprises will be uniformly lent by banks; the original self-owned working capital of state-owned enterprises will also be transferred to the bank for unified management; and it is stipulated that the fixed amount of working capital that enterprises need to use regularly in the future will still be appropriately arranged by governments at all levels in the annual fiscal budget, as an additional allocation of bank credit funds, and handed over to the bank for unified lending. In 1959, both industrial production and commodity circulation will have huge growth, and it is completely necessary for the state finance to allocate such a credit fund to the bank.

(III) Strive to Achieve the 1959 National Budget

Fellow Deputies! After the practice of the great leap forward in 1958, the people of our country have further enhanced their confidence in building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. As we said earlier, the 1959 National Budget is based on facts and can be completed and exceeded. However, to complete such a budget and realize the planned plan requires us to carry out a series of in-depth and detailed work, and requires the entire Party and the people of the whole country to continue to exert their efforts and work together.

In order to successfully realize the 1959 National Budget, we must resolutely implement the principle of "the whole country as one chess game," better combine centralized leadership with hierarchical management, and better combine the strength of the central government, localities, the state, enterprises, and the masses. Our national economy is developing in a planned and proportional manner. This is one of the basic characteristics of socialism. In socialist construction, the whole and the part, the key and the general, centralized leadership and hierarchical management are a unity of opposites. Without paying attention to the part, without taking care of the general, and without finding ways to mobilize the positive factors of all parties, it is impossible to develop various construction undertakings with greater, faster, better, and more economical results; however, hierarchical management must be hierarchical management under unified leadership, enthusiasm must be enthusiasm under the guidance of the state plan, and the general must obey the key, and the part must obey the whole. This is the case in terms of economic deployment, and it is also the case in terms of financial arrangements. Whether various localities and departments use the funds allocated by the budget or use self-raised funds for construction, they should all proceed from the overall situation, do everything possible to ensure the successful realization of the state plan and the national budget, and make their own part contribute the most to the victory of the whole.

In order to successfully realize the 1959 National Budget, we must also strengthen economic accounting, improve labor productivity, and reduce costs. In the national budget, state-owned enterprise income and capital construction expenditure account for a large proportion. Whether the national budget is successfully realized largely depends on the management and operation status of state-owned enterprises and construction units. Due to the need for high-speed development of production and construction undertakings in 1959, the supply of various raw materials and materials is generally not abundant. At the same time, labor must also maintain an appropriate proportion in various economic sectors such as industry and agriculture. Therefore, how to tap internal potential, save raw materials and materials, and improve labor productivity has become the main way to achieve this year's great leap forward plan. Many of our small and medium-sized enterprises were built during the great leap forward last year, with a poor technical foundation and insufficient management experience. There are inevitably many unreasonable aspects in the use of raw materials, materials, and labor organization, and it is very necessary to strive to improve production technology and management level on the original basis after last year's production practice. Many existing large, medium and small enterprises, as long as they further carry out mass technical reforms and improve labor organization and production management, and commercial departments at all levels further mobilize the masses, improve management, save funds, and reduce commodity circulation costs, there is also great potential to be tapped. Launching the broad masses to strengthen economic accounting, improve labor productivity and reduce costs is an important source of increasing enterprise income and increasing national accumulation.

In the management and operation of rural people's communes, it is necessary to establish various management systems and methods under the principle of combining unified leadership, unified operation, hierarchical management, and hierarchical accounting, and strive to strengthen planning management and financial management.

Building the country with diligence and thrift, running enterprises with diligence and thrift, running cooperatives with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift are the long-term policies of our country's socialist construction. In 1959, we will continue to carry out a larger-scale increase production and economize campaign. All economic departments, all enterprises and institutions, all people's communes must make the best possible use of existing equipment, save manpower, materials, and financial resources as much as possible; all administrative management departments must save expenses as much as possible. In short, we must be diligent and thrifty, carefully calculate, oppose extravagance and waste, so that every penny of funds can play as large a role as possible in construction. The increase production and economize campaign must be carried out on the premise of ensuring quality and ensuring safety, so as to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

Fellow Deputies! The current situation is very favorable for realizing the 1959 National Budget. Since the beginning of this year, good news has been frequently reported on all fronts of the national economy. After the rectification and consolidation last winter and this spring, the management and financial work of the rural people's communes have improved, and the farmers' enthusiasm for production has become even higher. All the lively and prosperous scenes show that the people of all ethnic groups in our country, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, are fighting heroically for the new great leap forward this year. We believe that the 1959 National Budget of our country will be successfully completed, and the socialist construction of our country will surely achieve greater victories in 1959.

    关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告
    一九五九年四月二十一日在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上
    国务院副总理兼财政部长　李先念各位代表：
    现在，我代表国务院提出关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，请予审查。
    （一）一九五八年国家决算
    一九五八年国家财政预算执行的结果，收入和支出，都大大超过了原来的设想；收支规模和增长速度，都远远超过了以往任何一年。这是我国人民奋战一年的胜利。这个胜利的基础，是一九五八年我国人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，贯彻执行了社会主义建设的总路线，实现了国民经济的空前伟大的跃进。这个胜利进一步雄辩地证明了社会主义制度的优越性和伟大生命力。
    下面，我就来谈谈一九五八年国家财政收支决算的具体情况。
    一九五八年国家收入四百一十八亿六千万元，相当于原预算数三百三十二亿元的百分之一百二十六点一。这一年财政收入比上年增加一百零八亿五千万元，而第一个五年计划期间一九五七年比一九五二年只增加一百三十四亿元。这一年财政收入比上年财政收入三百一十亿一千万元增长百分之三十五，而第一个五年计划期间每年平均增长速度只有百分之十二，即使增长最快的一九五三年和一九五六年，也只有百分之二十三和百分之十六。一九五八年收入决算中，各项税收一百八十七亿四千万元，为原预算的百分之一百一十三点三；企业和事业收入二百二十亿二千万元，为原预算的百分之一百三十九点三；公债收入七亿九千万元，为原预算的百分之一百二十六点四；其他收入三亿一千万元，为原预算的百分之一百四十点七。
    一九五八年支出四百零九亿六千万元，相当于原预算三百三十二亿元的百分之一百二十三点四。一九五八年支出同一九五七年支出三百零四亿二千万元比较，增加一百零五亿四千万元，增长百分之三十五。一九五八年支出决算中，经济建设费二百六十二亿七千万元，为原预算的百分之一百四十九点七；社会文教费四十三亿五千万元，为原预算的百分之八十八点九；国防费五十亿元，为原预算的百分之一百；行政管理费二十二亿七千万元，为原预算的百分之一百一十三点七。此外，还有归还内债外债和对外援助支出十一亿八千万元，其他支出二亿四千万元，增拨给银行作为发放贷款的资金十六亿五千万元。一九五八年支出超过预算的部分主要是用来扩大基本建设的规模。一九五八年上述经济、社会文教等各类支出中，用于基本建设投资方面的，总计为二百一十四亿元，比上年的一百二十六亿元增长百分之七十。各地方各部门在预算以外自筹的基本建设投资，还不在这个数目之内。由于精打细算，降低工程造价，用同样资金办更多事情等因素，一九五八年实际完成的基本建设工作量，就大于过去用同样投资所能完成的工作量。一九五八年文化、教育、科学和卫生事业得到了巨大的发展；这些方面的经费所以没有用完，主要是由于执行了教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，执行了勤工俭学和勤俭办事业的方针。一九五八年行政管理费所以超过原定预算，主要是由于国家建设事业的规模大大超过了原来的计划。
    一九五八年国家财政收支相抵，结余九亿元。这是属于地方预算的结余，将要由地方结转到一九五九年继续使用。
    由于财政收入大于支出，由于各企业、事业单位存款和人民储蓄的增加，这一年人民银行发放的工业贷款、农业贷款和商业贷款，都比上年增加很多。这些贷款的发放，有力地支持了工农业生产的发展和商品流转的扩大。由于工农业生产发展和城乡商品流转扩大的需要，市场货币流通量有了相应的增加。同时，国家商品物资库存也有了相当的增加。总起来说，一九五八年国家经济财政战线上的情况是十分良好的。
    党的领导，政治挂帅，这是一九五八年生产跃进、经济高涨的根本保证。没有全民整风运动和反右派斗争，没有党的社会主义建设总路线，没有广泛深入的社会主义和共产主义的思想教育，要取得一九五八年经济财政战线上的胜利是不可设想的。同时，我们的跃进也是同苏联和各兄弟国家的大力援助分不开的。
    一九五八年是党的群众路线大发展的一年。在工业、农业、商业、运输邮电和文化教育的各个战线上，都展开了蓬蓬勃勃的群众运动，充分调动了各方面的积极性，财政工作也是如此。在一九五八年二月第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议上，我们根据毛主席关于处理十大关系、调动一切积极因素的精神，提出了改进财政管理体制、改进企业财务管理制度和改进农业贷款管理的办法，接着，又先后制定了改进税收管理体制、改进基本建设财务管理制度的办法，等等。这些办法有利于更好地把统一计划同因地制宜的原则相结合，把集中领导同群众运动相结合，从而为努力增加收入、节约支出创造条件。例如，基本建设投资包干制度实行以后，许多企业的职工就在投资不增加的条件下，扩大了基本建设的规模。不是依靠少数人办财政，而是依靠有关单位和广大群众办财政；不是单纯在表报堆里从数字上打圈子，而是深入企业和事业单位，同群众一起进行财务核算和财政监督。这就使我们的财政工作出现了突飞猛进的新局面。
    一九五八年国家财政所以取得巨大的成就，归根到底，是来自工农业生产的高速度发展。一九五八年全部建成和部分建成投入生产的限额以上的厂矿约有七百个，比第一个五年计划期间全部投入生产和部分投入生产的厂矿还多一百六十多个。限额以下的中小型厂矿和人民公社举办的小型企业，更如雨后春笋。这一年全国工业总产值比上年增长百分之六十六，农业总产值比上年增长百分之六十四。这一年国营企业的劳动生产率大大提高，中央各工业部直属工业企业产品成本比上年降低百分之十二点五。上述这些，当然都相应地增大了国家财政的收入。这一年，财政部门在预算执行过程中，也根据收入不断增长的新情况，一次又一次地增加生产建设的经费。生产发展充裕了财政收入；财政收入的增长，又推动了国民经济的发展。收入和支出是相互促进的，只有生意兴隆，才能财源茂盛。可见“发展经济，保障供给”这个颠扑不破的真理，是永远也不会过时的。
    对于我国国民经济的伟大跃进和财政收支的巨大增长，人民是看得清楚的，是欢欣鼓舞的。我们的朋友也为我们这种成就感到高兴。帝国主义者和他们的应声虫不管怎样诬蔑和攻击，也无法否认我们大跃进的事实。有一些好心肠的人，怀疑财政收入增长得这样快，是不是由于加重了人民的负担？有这样的怀疑是可以理解的。因为一九五八年的大跃进是史无前例的。
    对于这样的新事物，人们的认识常常落后于实际。一九五八年财政收入增长得这么快，绝不是由于加重了人民的负担。大家知道，人民负担加重与否，主要看税收的增加是不是超过了生产增长和人民收入增长的速度，要看市场物价是不是稳定。一九五八年国家财政收入四百一十八亿六千万元当中，来自国营企业事业所缴纳的税收和利润，共占百分之八十三点九，而来自农村人民公社的缴款只占百分之十三点七，来自其他方面的缴款占百分之二点四。这一年国家向农村征收的农业税全部只有三十二亿六千万元，同上年的征收数字二十九亿七千万元比较，增加了二亿九千万元；这一年国家在农村征收的工商业税，由于农村工商业和农副业的发展，农民购买力的提高，相应地增加到二十一亿五千万元，比上年征收数字十八亿元增加了三亿五千万元；这一年国家在农村发行的公债和其他收入三亿二千万元，比上年的二亿九千万元增加了三千万元；三项合计共五十七亿三千万元，再加上各地方在预算以外征收的农业税附加四亿四千万元，合计为六十一亿七千万元。农民负担占农业总产值的比例，一九五七年是百分之十，一九五八年下降为百分之七。这就是说，尽管一九五八年农副业生产有了很大的发展，国家仍然执行了稳定农民负担的政策，农民的负担是相对地减少了，而不是增加了。一九五八年我国市场物价是稳定的。从市场供应来看，一九五八年秋季以来，城市中一部分副食品和某些日用工业品出现供不应求、略有紧张的情况，这主要是因为城市就业面扩大，职工人数增加，需要量增大。这一年全国兴办了许多新的企业和事业，全年平均，职工人数比上年增加了约八百万人，相当于原有职工人数的三分之一，生产资料和生活资料的需要大大增加了。同时，人民公社化以后，由于公社举办公共食堂和其他公共福利事业，农民的生活改善了，农村副食品消费量增大了，因而供应城市的部分相对地减少了；由于农民收入的增加，农村对日用工业品的需要也增加了。因此，尽管一九五八年工农业产品是增加的，市场商品供应数量是扩大的，仍然赶不上各方面需要的增长。当然商品调拨、运输及其他方面也有一些缺点，我们正在采取必要的措施，逐步加以改善。在我们这样一个人口众多、需要量很大的国家中，在国民经济这样大跃进和人民公社化这样巨大的社会变革当中，经济生活发生某些暂时的困难，是难以完全避免的。但是，尽管发生了某些供不应求的情况，我们仍然维持了市场物价的稳定。我国人民深深了解，为了迅速改变我国经济文化落后的局面，必须克勤克俭，渡过某些暂时的困难。经济发展了，事业前进了，这些困难是可以解决的。在我们社会主义国家，财政收入主要来自国营经济，增加收入是依靠国营经济和集体经济的发展，而不是依靠加重人民的负担；是依靠发展生产，而不是依靠发行货币。在发展生产的基础上，保证财政收支平衡，这是我们国家财政经济工作中历来遵循的一条重要原则。我们国家所以能够始终保持币值稳定和市场物价的稳定，原因就在这里。在我们社会主义国家，发展生产的根本目的，是为了最大限度地满足人民日益增长的物质和文化生活的需要；而需要的不断增长，反过来又促进生产的不断发展。广大职工和人民群众，为建设社会主义和自己的幸福而生产，因此他们能够干劲十足地从事劳动。我们国家所以能够高速度地发展生产、增加收入，原因也在这里。
  （二）一九五九年国家预算的安排
    一九五九年是我国第二个五年计划的第二年。我国人民在一九五九年要根据党的社会主义建设总路线，在上年获得伟大胜利和丰富经验的基础上，实现国民经济的继续大跃进。
    适应这种情况，现在编成的一九五九年国家预算草案，是一个挖掘潜力，支持全面跃进的预算；是一个贯彻“全国一盘棋”精神，在集中领导的原则下调动各方面积极因素的预算；也是一个既积极而又可靠的预算。
    一九五九年国家预算收入五百二十亿零一千万元，预算支出五百二十亿零一千万元，收支平衡。同一九五八年决算数比较，收入增加一百零一亿五千万元，增长百分之二十四点二；支出增加一百一十亿零五千万元，增长百分之二十七。
    一九五九年预算收入的增长，是充分考虑了客观可能性的。按照计划草案，一九五九年工业生产总值将比上年增长百分之四十一，农业生产总值将比上年增长百分之三十九，财政收入的增长，是同上述国民经济指标的增长基本上相适应的。我们考虑到一九五九年增加财政收入的一些好条件，例如：第一、轻工业生产主要是依靠上年收获的农产品作原料，一九五八年农业的空前丰收，给一九五九年轻工业生产提供了远比上年为好的条件，而轻工业生产是可以为国家提供更多的积累的；第二、一九五八年大量投入生产的厂矿将要在一九五九年发挥更大的作用，一九五九年还将有一批新建的厂矿投入生产，设备增加了，生产的规模更大了；第三、还由于经过一九五八年，我们开始有了大跃进的经验，有了在生产建设方面大搞群众运动的经验，我们的人民公社经过去冬今春的整顿工作，将要更加发挥它的优越性；等等。因此，尽管预算收入的增长幅度很大，但这是有根据的，是经过努力能够完成甚至超额完成的。
    一九五九年国家预算各类收入如下：
    一、各项税收一百九十九亿元，占预算收入总数的百分之三十八点三，比上年增长百分之六点二。其中，工商业税一百五十二亿元，比上年增长百分之七点二；农业税三十三亿元，比上年增长百分之一点三。
    二、企业和事业收入三百一十八亿元，占预算收入总数的百分之六十一点一，比上年增长百分之四十四点四。
    三、其他收入三亿一千万元，占预算收入总数的百分之零点六，和上年相等。
    一九五八年六月经第一届全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准，从一九五九年起，全国性经济建设公债停止发行。同时国家公布“中华人民共和国地方经济建设公债条例”，规定各省、自治区、直辖市可以根据当地的情况，发行比较短期的地方性的公债。但是，除了个别省份以外，各省、自治区、直辖市都决定今年暂不发行公债。
    一九五九年国家预算收入，按不同经济成分的缴款来划分，则全民所有制的国营企业的缴款将为四百五十七亿三千万元，比上年增加一百零六亿元，占预算收入总数的百分之八十七点九；农村人民公社的缴款将为五十八亿七千万元，比上年增加一亿四千万元，占预算收入总数的百分之一十一点三；其他方面的缴款将为四亿一千万元，比上年减少五亿九千万元，占预算收入总数的百分之零点八。可以看出，一九五九年预算收入的增长，绝大部分将是依靠国营经济的发展和国营企业上缴部分的增加，农村人民公社的负担是基本上保持上年水平的。一九五九年国家征收农业税三十三亿元，同上年的征收数字大体相等；农村工商业税二十四亿五千万元，比上年增加三亿元，这是根据上年征收情况参照今年计划产值计算的；农村其他收入一亿二千万元，比上年减少二亿元，这是因为今年绝大部分地区不发行公债了。此外，一九五九年还有农业税附加四亿四千万元，也同上年的数字相等。农村人民公社各项负担在农业总产值中所占的比例，一九五八年为百分之七，一九五九年将下降为百分之五点二。一九五九年国家预算各类支出如下：
    一、经济建设费三百一十七亿元，占预算支出总数的百分之六十一，比上年增长百分之二十五点九。
    二、社会文教费五十七亿三千万元，占预算支出总数的百分之十一，比上年增长百分之三十二。
    三、国防费五十八亿元，占预算支出总数的百分之十一点二，比上年增长百分之十六。
    四、行政管理费二十六亿九千万元，占预算支出总数的百分之五点二，比上年增长百分之十八点三。
    五、债务支出十一亿元，占预算支出总数的百分之二，比上年增长百分之二十一点七。
    六、对外援助支出六亿元，占预算支出总数的百分之一点二，比上年增长百分之一百一十八。
    七、其他支出二亿七千万元，占预算支出总数的百分之零点五，比上年增长百分之一十三点三。
    八、增拨银行信贷资金三十一亿七千万元，占预算支出总数的百分之六点一。
    九、总预备费九亿五千万元，占预算支出总数的百分之一点八。
    上述一九五九年国家预算支出，如果按中央预算和地方预算来划分，则中央预算二百七十九亿一千万元，占预算支出总数的百分之五十三点七；地方预算二百四十一亿元，占预算支出总数的百分之四十六点三。
    关于一九五九年国家预算支出的安排，需要说明以下几点：
    （一）一九五九年国家预算支出中，经济建设费和社会文教费所占的比例为百分之七十二，仍然保持一九五八年的水平；国防费和行政费所占的比例却进一步有所降低，一九五八年为百分之十七点八，一九五九年将下降为百分之十六点四。国家机关所需费用的比重进一步缩小了。
    （二）一九五九年国家预算支出中，用于基本建设的投资共二百七十亿元，比上年的二百一十四亿元增加五十六亿元，增长百分之二十六。基本建设投资两年来增加很快。第一个五年计划期间各年，基本建设投资大体上占国家预算支出总数的百分之三十到四十，只有一九五六年占百分之四十五点七，而一九五八年则增加到百分之五十二，一九五九年仍然是百分之五十二。一九五九年除了预算所列的基本建设投资以外，还将有各地方、各部门自筹的基本建设投资。为了充分发挥各建设单位的主动性和积极性，鼓励他们在既定投资的范围内，精打细算，少花钱，多办事。一九五九年将继续实行基本建设投资包干制度，即是：在保证工程质量，保证不降低生产能力，不推迟交工日期，不突破投资总额，不增加非生产性建设比重的条件下，把年度经济计划和国家预算所规定的基本建设投资，交由有关建设单位统一掌握，包干使用，以便有效地发挥建设单位广大职工群众的积极性。当然，今年还要根据实际执行中的经验，在某些方面对包干办法作若干补充。
    （三）一九五九年根据党中央和毛主席的指示，在经济建设支出中增加了对人民公社的投资十亿元，作为国家对人民公社的财政补助。这笔资金主要地将分配给经济条件较差的人民公社和生产队，帮助他们发展生产，使他们能在不长的时间内，赶上比较富裕的公社的水平。当然，国家拨给的资金是有限度的，人民公社发展经济主要还是依靠本身的积累，正如毛主席说过的，一切经济比较落后的公社和生产队，应当象河北省遵化县被人称为“穷棒子”社的王国藩社那样，自力更生，用自己的双手艰苦奋斗，改变现在经济上落后的面貌。
    （四）一九五九年国家预算支出中，增拨银行信贷资金三十一亿七千万元。过去几年，国营企业需要的流动资金，一部分由预算拨款，一部分由银行贷款。为了及时保证企业所需要的流动资金，克服过去分别供应资金时容易产生的那种脱节、重复和手续繁杂现象，已经规定，从一九五九年开始，将国营企业所需要的流动资金，全部改为由银行统一贷放；国营企业原有的自有流动资金，也一并划归银行统一管理；并且规定今后企业需要经常占用的定额流动资金，仍然由各级政府在年度财政预算中适当加以安排，作为增拨银行信贷资金，交由银行统一贷放。一九五九年工业生产和商品流转都将有巨大的增长，国家财政给银行增拨这样一笔信贷资金是完全必要的。
    （三）为实现一九五九年国家预算而奋斗
    各位代表！经过一九五八年大跃进的实践，我国人民更加增强了多快好省地建设社会主义的信心。我们前面说过，一九五九年国家预算是有根据的，是可以完成和超额完成的。但是完成这样一个预算，实现预定的计划，需要我们进行一系列深入细致的工作，需要全党和全国人民继续鼓足干劲，共同努力。
    为了圆满地实现一九五九年国家预算，我们必须坚决贯彻实行“全国一盘棋”的原则，把集中领导同分级管理更好地结合起来，把中央同地方、国家同企业、企业同群众的力量更好地结合起来。我们的国民经济是有计划按比例发展的。这是社会主义的基本特点之一。在社会主义建设中，整体和局部、重点和一般、集中领导和分级管理是对立的统一体，不注意局部，不照顾一般，不设法调动各方面的积极因素，就不可能多快好省地发展各种建设事业；但是，分级管理必须是统一领导下的分级管理，积极性必须是国家计划指导下的积极性，一般必须服从重点，局部必须服从整体。从经济部署来说是如此，从财政安排来说也是如此。各地方各部门不论使用预算拨给的资金，或者使用自筹资金进行建设，都应当从整体出发，尽一切力量保证国家计划和国家预算的圆满实现，使自己这个局部为整体的胜利作出最大的贡献。
    为了圆满地实现一九五九年国家预算，我们还必须加强经济核算，提高劳动生产率，降低成本。在国家预算当中，国营企业收入和基本建设支出占着很大的比重，国家预算是否顺利实现，在很大的程度上决定于国营企业和建设单位的经营管理状况。由于一九五九年生产和建设事业高速度发展的需要，各种原料、材料的供应整个说来并不宽裕，同时，劳动力在工业、农业等各经济部门中也必须保持适当的比例，因此，如何挖掘内部潜力，节约原料、材料，提高劳动生产率，就成为实现今年大跃进计划的主要途径。我们有许多中小企业是去年大跃进当中建设起来的，技术基础较差，管理经验不足，原料、材料使用和劳动力组织方面难免有很多不合理的地方，而经过去年的生产实践，在原有基础上努力提高生产技术和管理水平，是十分必要的。许多原有的大型和中小型企业，只要进一步开展群众性技术改革，改善劳动组织和生产管理工作，各级商业部门只要进一步发动群众，改善经营管理，节约资金，降低商品流转费用，也大有潜力可挖。发动广大群众为加强经济核算、提高劳动生产率和降低成本而进行的斗争，是增加企业收入、增大国家积累的重要源泉。
    在农村人民公社的经营管理中，要在统一领导、统一经营和分级管理、分级核算相结合的原则下，建立各种管理制度和办法，努力加强计划管理和财务管理。
    勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业，这是我们国家社会主义建设的长期的方针。一九五九年我们要继续开展更大规模的增产节约运动。一切经济部门，一切企业事业单位，一切人民公社，都必须尽可能地利用现有的设备，尽可能地节约人力、物力和财力；一切行政管理部门必须尽可能地节约开支。总之，必须克勤克俭，精打细算，反对铺张浪费，使每一文资金在建设中都能发挥尽可能大的作用。开展增产节约运动，必须在保证质量、保证安全的前提下进行，做到又多又快又好又省。
    各位代表！目前的形势对实现一九五九年国家预算是十分有利的。今年年初以来，国民经济的各个战线上，已经捷报频传。农村人民公社经过去冬今春的整顿和巩固，经营管理和财务工作都提高了一步，农民的生产积极性更加高涨。一切生气勃勃欣欣向荣的景象都显示：我国各族人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，正在为今年的新的大跃进而英勇奋斗。我们相信，一九五九年我国国家预算一定能够圆满完成，一九五九年我国社会主义建设一定能够取得更大的胜利。
