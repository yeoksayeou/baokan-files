Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 27th: President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said at a reception held here tonight that although American imperialism is extremely vicious, and has a group of lackeys such as Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, Adenauer, and Ngo Dinh Diem, they can do nothing and will ultimately fail. On the contrary, the countries of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, are becoming increasingly united and will surely achieve victory.

President Ho Chi Minh also said that both the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the German Democratic Republic are immensely honored to be able to stand at the forefront of the socialist camp to meet imperialism head-on. He said that although the two countries are thousands of miles apart, the hearts of the people of the two countries are closely linked.

President Ho Chi Minh made these remarks at a banquet held tonight by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam to welcome the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, led by Dieckmann and Matern.

Matern, First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, said in his speech at the banquet that the peace policy of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, has been and is making great progress. Although the reactionaries are doing their best to obstruct the convening of an international conference to discuss the German question, a foreign ministers' conference will soon be held in Geneva to discuss the German question. This is the first time in history that representatives of two Germanys have participated in a major international conference.

Matern said that both Democratic Germany and Democratic Vietnam are fighting for the unification of their respective countries. Because the two countries have common goals and ideals, they are more cordial and easier to understand each other.

At the beginning of the banquet, Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, delivered a speech, warmly welcoming the distinguished guests from the hometown of Marx, Engels, Thälmann, and Pieck.

Also present at the banquet tonight were Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Ministers Truong Chinh, Vo Nguyen Giap, Pham Hung, and Phan Ke Toai, Deputy Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly Hoang Van Hoan and Ton Quang Phiet, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to Vietnam.

The delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, led by Chairman Dieckmann and First Deputy Chairman Matern, arrived in Hanoi by plane from India on the afternoon of the 27th.

    胡志明主席在欢宴德国议院代表团时说
    越德守卫着社会主义阵营前哨
    马特恩说两国为共同目的和理想而斗争
    新华社河内27日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明今天晚上在这里举行的招待会上发表讲话说，尽管美帝国主义穷凶极恶，又有李承晚、蒋介石、阿登纳和吴庭艳等一批仆从，但是他们不能有何作为，并且终归要失败。相反，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国日益团结一致，一定会取得胜利。
    胡志明主席还说，越南民主共和国和德意志民主共和国都以能够站在社会主义阵营前哨阵地上迎击帝国主义而感到无比的光荣。他说，两个国家虽然远距万里，但是两国人民的心紧紧地联结在一起。
    胡志明主席是在越南国会常务委员会今晚欢迎由狄克曼和马特恩率领的德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团的宴会上说这番话。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团第一副主席马特恩在宴会上讲话时说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的和平政策已经和正在取得很大的进展。尽管反动派尽量阻挠召开国际会议来讨论德国问题，但是不久就将在日内瓦举行外长会议来讨论德国问题。这是历史上第一次有两个德国的代表参加的重大国际会议。
    马特恩说，民主德国和民主越南都正在为自己祖国的统一而斗争。由于两国有着共同的目的和理想，因此彼此之间也就更加亲切和更加易于了解。
    宴会开始时，越南国会常务委员会委员长孙德胜致词，热烈欢迎来自马克思、恩格斯、台尔曼和皮克的故乡的贵宾们。
    出席今晚宴会的还有范文同总理，长征、武元甲、范雄、潘继遂副总理，国会常务委员会副委员长黄文欢、孙光阀，以及各国驻越南外交使节等。
    狄克曼主席和马特恩第一副主席率领的德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团一行十三人是27日下午乘飞机从印度到达河内的。
