Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, April 18th: Newspapers here today published the joint statement of the Mongolian party delegation and the Hungarian party and government delegation's talks.

In the joint statement, the two party and government delegations expressed satisfaction that the unbreakable friendship and close cooperation between Mongolia and Hungary, based on the spirit of proletarian internationalism, is developing. During the talks, the two delegations comprehensively discussed further development of friendly cooperation between the two countries, and signed a loan agreement on Hungarian assistance to Mongolia in developing production and a health care cooperation agreement.

The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party delegations emphasized in the joint statement that practical experience fully confirms the correctness of the declaration of the Moscow meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties in November 1957. This declaration will continue to be the program of all Marxist parties. The delegations also highlighted the historical significance of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the program adopted by the Congress for the comprehensive development of communist construction in the Soviet Union.

The two party delegations pointed out that revisionism is the main danger in the current workers' movement. The revisionism fully manifested in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia aims to oppose the unity of communist parties of various countries and create divisions in the socialist camp. The two parties will continue to fight against revisionism and its various manifestations. Both sides also believe that it is necessary to continue the struggle against dogmatism.

The joint statement said that eliminating the threat of war created by imperialism and safeguarding world peace is the most important demand of all mankind today. The two governments fully support the Soviet government's proposal on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and believe that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the settlement of the West Berlin issue will play a significant role in establishing a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany.

The joint statement said that the subversive activities of US imperialism in Southeast Asia threaten world peace and security. The two governments resolutely condemn the actions of imperialists headed by the United States in actively plotting conspiracies by the Southeast Asia military bloc. Both sides believe that establishing a peace zone in the Asian and Pacific region is of significant importance to the current situation.

The joint statement pointed out that as a result of the conspiracies of Western imperialist blocs, the United Nations has not yet accepted the Mongolian People's Republic as a member state. The Hungarian government resolutely condemns this conspiracy by Western imperialist blocs and declares that it will resolutely fight for the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations.

The two governments expressed support for the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries against colonial rule and for national independence. The two countries will further develop friendly relations with various countries based on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in internal affairs, and peaceful coexistence.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, April 18th: The Hungarian party and government delegation led by Munnich, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, left Ulaanbaatar by special plane this morning after a five-day friendly visit to Mongolia. The delegation will visit the three fraternal countries of China, Vietnam, and North Korea.

Tsedenbal, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, went to the airport to see the delegation off. In his farewell speech, he wished that the friendship between the Mongolian and Hungarian people would be increasingly consolidated and developed. He also expressed gratitude to the Hungarian people for their assistance to the Mongolian people.

In his farewell speech, Munnich said that the warm reception given to the Hungarian party and government delegation in Mongolia made them deeply appreciate the profound friendship between the Hungarian and Mongolian people. He expressed his belief that the talks held by the two party and government delegations this time will contribute to enhancing the strength of the socialist camp and combating the aggressive policies of imperialism.

Other Mongolian party and state leaders such as Tsende, Balzhinnyam, Dugsuren, and Tumur-Ochir also went to the airport to see them off. Xie Fusheng, the Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, and diplomatic envoys from various fraternal countries to Mongolia also went to the airport to see them off.

　　蒙匈两国党政代表团联合声明
　　加强友好合作　维护世界和平
    新华社乌兰巴托18日电　此间报纸今天发表了蒙古政党代表团和匈牙利党政代表团会谈的联合声明。
    两国党政代表团在联合声明中满意地指出，蒙匈两国以无产阶级国际主义精神为基础的牢不可破的友谊和亲密合作正在向前发展。两国代表团在这次会谈中全面地讨论了进一步发展两国的友好合作，并且签订了关于匈牙利帮助蒙古发展生产的贷款协定和卫生保健合作协定。
    蒙古人民革命党和匈牙利社会主义工人党代表团在联合声明中强调指出，生活实践完全证实了1957年11月共产党、工人党代表莫斯科会议的宣言是正确的。这个宣言今后仍然是一切马克思政党的纲领。代表团还着重指出了苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会和代表大会通过的在苏联全面展开共产主义建设的纲领的历史意义。
    两党代表团指出，修正主义是目前工人运动的主要危险。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领中充分表现出来的修正主义，是以反对各国共产党的团结、制造社会主义阵营的分裂为目的的。两党将继续同修正主义及其各种表现进行斗争。双方并认为，同教条主义继续作斗争是必要的。
    联合声明说，消除帝国主义制造的战争威胁、维护世界和平是全人类的当前最重要的要求。两国政府完全支持苏联政府关于缔结对德和约的建议，认为缔结对德和约和解决西柏林问题对于建立一个和平、民主、统一的德国有很大作用。
    联合声明说，美帝国主义在东南亚进行的颠复活动威胁着世界和平和安全，两国政府坚决谴责以美国为首的帝国主义者积极策划东南亚军事集团进行阴谋活动的行为。双方认为，在亚洲和太平洋地区建立和平地区对目前的形势有着重要的作用。
    联合声明指出，由于西方帝国主义集团进行阴谋活动的结果，联合国至今仍未接受蒙古人民共和国为会员国。匈牙利政府坚决谴责西方帝国主义集团的这种阴谋，并且声明要为接纳蒙古人民共和国参加联合国而坚决斗争。
    两国政府表示支持亚非国家人民的反对殖民统治、争取民族独立的斗争。两国将根据互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不干涉内政与和平共处的原则进一步发展同各国的友好关系。
    新华社乌兰巴托18日电　由社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、工农革命政府总理明尼赫率领的匈牙利党政代表团，在蒙古作了五天的友好访问后，今天上午乘专机离开乌兰巴托。代表团将前往中国、越南和朝鲜三个兄弟国家进行访问。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第一书记、部长会议主席泽登巴尔前往机场为代表团送行。他在致欢送词时祝蒙匈两国人民的友谊日益巩固和发展。他并且表示感谢匈牙利人民给予蒙古人民的援助。
    明尼赫在致告别词时说，匈牙利党政代表团在蒙古受到的殷勤招待，使他们深深地体会到匈蒙两国人民的深厚友谊。他表示相信，两国党政代表团这次举行的会谈，将对增强社会主义阵营的力量和打击帝国主义的侵略政策作出贡献。
    到机场送行的还有蒙古党和国家的其他领导人曾德、巴尔吉尼雅姆、杜格苏伦、图穆尔—奥奇尔等。中国驻蒙古大使谢甫生和各兄弟国家驻蒙古的外交使节也到机场欢送。
