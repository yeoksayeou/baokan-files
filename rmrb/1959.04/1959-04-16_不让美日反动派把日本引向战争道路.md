The Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and for peace, independence, and democracy is flourishing across the country with magnificent momentum. The National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," composed of more than 140 Japanese organizations, held a "Unified Action Day for All People to Abolish the Security Treaty and Prevent its Revision" on the 15th. According to the original plan, county people's conferences, regional conferences, and workplace conferences were held simultaneously throughout Japan; workers, students, and citizens in Tokyo collectively petitioned Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi; and members of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held large-scale demonstrations in the city.

The Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty" is a continuation of the Japanese people's long-standing struggle against US imperialism's occupation and the resurgence of Japanese militarism. For more than ten years after the war, the Japanese people have waged unremitting struggles to save the nation from misfortune and to get rid of their miserable situation of being enslaved. They have organized massive demonstrations and collected tens of millions of signatures under the slogans of opposing US occupation and opposing US imperialism turning Japan into a US colony and military base. They have also joined hands to prevent the government from surveying land, defending their land with blood and lives, and thwarting the US military's conspiracy to expand its bases. These arduous struggles show that the Japanese people's will to strive for peace, independence, and democracy is indestructible, and they have the perseverance to never give up until their goals are achieved. The current struggle against the US-Japan "Security Treaty," which has developed on the basis of long-term struggles in the past, is unprecedented in post-war Japanese history in terms of its scale, the breadth of participating classes, and its momentum. Now, not only the broad masses of Japanese working people, intellectuals, and small and medium-sized bourgeoisie are actively participating in this struggle, but even some members of the Japanese ruling apparatus have expressed dissatisfaction with Nobusuke Kishi's policy of selling out sovereignty and national interests. This shows that the unity of the forces for peace, independence, and democracy in Japan has been further strengthened. In recent years, Japan's patriotic and democratic forces, through multiple movements, especially the struggle against the "Police Duties Law Amendment Bill" last year, have fully demonstrated that unity is strength, and only by strengthening unity can we defeat the enemy. The recent decision of the Japan Socialist Party and the Japan Communist Party to establish broad joint actions and conduct solidarity and cooperation is of great significance for further uniting all patriotic forces and promoting the victorious development of the struggle.

US Secretary of State Dulles said that the US-Japan "Security Treaty" "is not a charity, and certainly not to ensure Japan's security. It is part of the US security plan." Everyone knows that in the dictionary of US imperialism, "ensuring security" is just a synonym for carrying out aggression. The US-Japan "Security Treaty" was imposed on the Japanese people by the United States in September 1951, at the height of the Korean War. This treaty, which aimed at aggression and enslavement of the Japanese nation, established the right of the United States to station troops and use bases in Japan indefinitely. Since then, this US chain with the "security" label has made Japan a nominally independent country, but in reality, it is in a state of semi-occupation. Currently, there are a total of 70,000 US troops stationed in Japan, and the United States has 101 military bases in Japan, including the center of the atomic bombing base. Under the protection of the "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement" signed later, the US military stationed in Japan arbitrarily violates the basic human rights and safety of the Japanese people. According to materials published by the Japanese Ministry of Justice, in just one year from October 1953 to October 1954, the Japanese Public Prosecutor's Office accepted 6,465 cases of crimes committed by the US military and their families against the Japanese people. This means that the Japanese people suffer from US military robberies almost every two days, Japanese women are raped by the US military once every four days, an average of four Japanese people are injured by US military violence every day, and an average of three Japanese people are injured or become disabled due to US military car accidents every day. The US-Japan "Security Treaty" seriously infringes upon and tramples on Japan's territory and sovereignty. The humiliation and persecution suffered by the Japanese people in this regard are too numerous to mention. Therefore, since its conclusion, it has been resolutely opposed by the Japanese people, who firmly demand that the Japanese government abolish this treaty of national betrayal and humiliation.

However, the Nobusuke Kishi government, which only follows the lead of the United States, not only turns a deaf ear to the voices of the broad masses of people demanding the abolition of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," but on the contrary, is eager to use negotiations with the US government to revise the treaty in order to whitewash and strengthen this yoke that enslaves the Japanese nation. The "Outline for Revising the US-Japan Security Treaty" announced by the Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party on April 8 has clearly shown that the Nobusuke Kishi group is determined to further sell out national sovereignty and national interests according to US requirements. According to the Nobusuke Kishi group's "Outline," the "Security Treaty" after revision will not only not change the basic nature of the original treaty in the slightest, but will further drag Japan into the US military aggression system, making Japan an accomplice in US aggression in Asia. According to the "Outline," the US military "can use Japanese facilities and areas," thus putting a legal cloak on the long-term occupation of Japan by the US military. The US-Japanese reactionaries also use the tactic of superficially raising Japan's equal status in the treaty to make Japan undertake more military obligations. The "Outline" writes that the United States has the obligation to "defend" Japan, and at the same time, Japan must "complete the tasks that should be completed within the scope allowed by national strength and the constitution." To put it bluntly, it means that the United States wants to support Japanese militarism, rearm Japan, and turn Japan into a US strategic base in the Far East; Japan must actively strengthen the military power of potential imperialism in order to serve the United States once it launches an aggressive offensive. "Using Asians to fight Asians" has always been a consistent trick of US imperialism to carry out aggression. Especially after the United States has repeatedly failed in its personal battles in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait, it has become even more eager to support the forces of Japanese militarism to take the lead for it, while retreating to the second line, in order to get rid of the increasingly deep predicament. The Nobusuke Kishi group attempts to rely on US assistance to revive Japanese militarism, suppress Japan's peaceful and democratic forces, rebuild the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and realize its aggressive ambitions to expand into Southeast Asian countries. Nobusuke Kishi clamored in October last year to abolish the clauses in the Japanese constitution prohibiting war and advocated that Japan send troops abroad, but now he is just affirming it with circuitous provisions. For example, the Nobusuke Kishi group stipulates in the "Outline" that Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands will be included in the "treaty application area" in the future, which is actually preparing to use these strategic islands as bases to organize aggression groups in Northeast Asia or on a larger scale. Because the areas of application of the military treaties concluded by the United States with the Chiang Kai-shek group, the Syngman Rhee group, and the Philippines all include these islands.

In recent years, with the vigorous development of the Japanese people's movement, Japan's democratic forces have grown significantly. In order to maintain its reactionary rule, the Japanese monopoly capital, represented by the Nobusuke Kishi government, does not hesitate to collude with US imperialism to suppress its own people. Like the current "Security Treaty," the "Outline" shows that the US military can, at the request of the Japanese government, interfere in Japan's internal affairs and suppress the Japanese people's movement, prettifying it as helping to prevent "indirect aggression." Everyone knows that "indirect aggression" is a common term used by US imperialism to invade other countries. In the future, unless the Japanese people obey the United States in every way, any words and deeds that are unfavorable to the United States and the Japanese ruling class can be suppressed under the guise of "indirect aggression." This is actually paving the way for the United States to accelerate the fascistization of Japan and for the United States to further interfere in Japan's internal affairs.

The "Outline for Revising the US-Japan Security Treaty" of the Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party fully exposes the conspiracy of the Nobusuke Kishi group to willingly sell out Japan's sovereignty and national interests and act as an accomplice of the United States. It will make the Japanese people more aware that if the conspiracy of the US-Japanese reactionaries succeeds, the Japanese nation will be dragged onto the path of war and destruction. Only by launching larger-scale struggles can the Japanese people defeat the conspiracy of US imperialism and Japanese potential imperialist elements to lead Japan onto the path of war.

The Japanese people oppose the US occupation of Japan and the US turning Japan into a US colony and military base; the Asian people also oppose the US using Japan to invade Asia and implement the policy of "Asians fighting Asians." Therefore, the Japanese people's struggle against the revision and striving for the abolition of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" is by no means isolated. The Chinese people and all peace-loving Asian people will firmly stand with the Japanese people, and fight to the end to defend Asian and world peace and to completely destroy the imperialist forces that invade Japan, invade Asia, and endanger the world! The Nobusuke Kishi group is willing to act as a tool of US aggressive policy, and is an enemy of the Japanese people and an enemy of the Asian people. It will certainly have no future. It will inevitably be spurned by the broad masses of Asian people, especially the Japanese people, and will inevitably further become an orphan of Asia!

### 不让美日反动派把日本引向战争道路

    不让美日反动派把日本引向战争道路
    日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”、争取和平、独立、民主的斗争，正在以波澜壮阔的气势在全国各地蓬勃发展。日本一百四十多个团体组成的阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，于15日举行了“为废除安全条约和阻止修改安全条约全体人民统一行动日”。按照原定计划，日本全国各地同时举行县民大会、地区大会和工作场所大会；东京的工人、学生和市民对日本首相岸信介举行集体请愿；日本工会总评议会的会员们还在市内举行大规模的示威游行。
    日本人民阻止修改和争取废除“安全条约”的斗争，是日本人民长期以来反对美帝国主义占领、反对日本军国主义再起的斗争的延续。战后十多年来，日本人民为了挽救民族的厄运，为了摆脱被奴役的悲惨境遇，进行了坚持不懈的斗争。他们曾在反对美国占领、反对美帝国主义把日本变成美国的殖民地和军事基地的口号下，组织规模巨大的示威游行，征集成千万的签名。他们也曾手拉手地阻止政府测量土地的工作，用鲜血和生命保卫了自己的土地，击退了美军扩充基地的阴谋。这些艰巨的斗争表明，日本人民争取和平、独立、民主的意志是不可摧毁的，他们有不达目的誓不休止的坚毅精神。在过去长期斗争的基础上发展起来的这次反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，其规模之大、参加的阶层之广和声势之壮，在战后日本历史上都是空前的。现在不仅广大的日本劳动人民、知识分子和中、小资产阶级踊跃地参加了这个斗争，连日本统治机构的一部分人，也对岸信介出卖主权和民族利益的政策表示不满。这说明，日本争取和平、独立、民主力量的团结有了进一步加强。近年来，日本的爱国民主力量通过多次运动，特别是去年反对“警职法修正案”的斗争，已经充分证明：团结就是力量，只有加强团结才能战胜敌人。最近日本社会党同日本共产党决定建立广泛的联合行动和进行团结合作，对于进一步团结一切爱国力量，促进斗争的胜利发展，具有十分重大的意义。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯说过，日美“安全条约”“不是慈善事业，当然不是为了保障日本的安全。这是保障美国安全计划的一部分。”人人皆知，在美帝国主义的辞典中，“保障安全”不过是进行侵略的同义语。日美“安全条约”是在1951年9月朝鲜战争最激烈的时候，美国强加在日本人民头上的。这项以侵略和奴役日本民族为目的的条约，确定美国在日本无限期驻军和使用基地的权利。从此，这条“安全”牌的美国锁链就使日本成了名义上的独立国家，而实际上处于半被占领状态。目前，驻日美军总计七万人，美国在日本的军事基地达一百零一处，其中包括原子轰炸基地的中心。驻日美军在“安全条约”以及后来签订的“行政协定”的庇护下，随意侵犯日本人民的基本人权和生命安全。据日本法务省公布的材料，只在1953年10月到1954年10月的一年中，美军及其家属侵犯日本人民的罪行，经日本检察厅受理的就达六千四百六十五件。这就是说，日本人民几乎每隔两天就要遭受一次美军抢劫，日本妇女每隔四天就遭到美军一次强奸暴行，每天平均有四个日本人被美军的暴行伤害，每天平均有三个日本人因美军的车祸而受伤或变成残废。日美“安全条约”严重地侵犯和蹂躏了日本的领土和主权，日本人民在这方面所遭受的屈辱和迫害是罄竹难书的。因此，当它缔结以来，一直遭到日本人民的坚决反对，日本人民坚决要求日本政府废除这个丧权辱国的条约。
    但是，唯美国马首是瞻的岸信介政府对于广大人民要求废除日美“安全条约”的呼声，非但充耳不闻，相反地，却急于通过同美国政府修改条约的谈判，来粉饰和加强这具奴役日本民族的枷锁。日本政府和自由民主党4月8日公布的“修改日美安全条约纲要”已经清楚表明，岸信介集团决心根据美国要求进一步出卖国家主权和民族利益。按照岸信介集团的“纲要”，修改以后的“安全条约”，不仅不会丝毫改变原条约的基本性质，而且将进一步把日本拖入美国的军事侵略体系，使日本充当美国侵略亚洲的帮凶。按照“纲要”规定，美军“可以使用日本的设施和区域”，这样便为美军的长期占领日本披上了合法的外衣。美日反动派还利用表面上提高日本在条约中的对等地位的手法，使日本承担更多的军事义务。“纲要”写道，美国有“保卫”日本的义务，同时日本也要根据“国家力量和宪法允许的范围内完成应当完成的任务”。揭穿了说就是：美国要扶植日本军国主义，重新武装日本，使日本变成美国在远东的战略基地；日本要积极加强潜在帝国主义的军事力量，以便美国一旦发动侵略攻势为美国效劳。“用亚洲人打亚洲人”原是美帝国主义进行侵略的一贯伎俩。特别是美国在中近东和台湾海峡地区亲自上阵连续遭到失败以后，就更加想把日本军国主义势力扶植起来为它打先锋，而自己退居第二线，以摆脱越陷越深的困境。岸信介集团则企图依靠美国的帮助，来复活日本军国主义，镇压日本的和平民主力量，重建“大东亚共荣圈”，实现它对东南亚各国进行扩张的侵略野心。岸信介在去年10月就曾叫嚷取消日本宪法中关于禁止战争的条款，主张日本派兵出国，现在不过是用转弯抹角的条文把它肯定下来罢了。例如，岸信介集团在“纲要”中规定将来要把冲绳岛和小笠原群岛划入“条约适用地区”，这实际上就是准备以这些战略岛屿为据点，组织东北亚或更大范围的侵略集团。因为美国同蒋介石集团、李承晚集团以及菲律宾缔结的军事条约的适用区域都包括这些岛屿。
    近几年来，随着日本人民运动的蓬勃发展，日本民主力量有了很大的增长。以岸信介政府为代表的日本垄断资本为了维护自己的反动统治，不惜勾结美帝国主义镇压本国人民。和现行的“安全条约”一样，“纲要”表明美军可以根据日本政府的要求，干涉日本内政，镇压日本人民运动，美其名曰帮同制止“间接侵略”，谁都知道，“间接侵略”是美帝国主义侵略别的国家的通常用语。今后日本人民除非处处依从美国，否则任何不利于美国和日本统治阶级的一言一行，都可以在“间接侵略”的罪名下横遭镇压。这实际是为美国的加速日本的法西斯化、为美国进一步干涉日本内政开辟了道路。
    日本政府和自由民主党“修改日美安全条约纲要”，充分暴露了岸信介集团甘心出卖日本主权和民族利益、充当美国帮凶的阴谋。它将使日本人民更加认识到，美日反动派的阴谋如果得逞，日本民族将被拖上战争毁灭的道路。日本人民只有展开更大规模的斗争，才能击败美帝国主义和日本潜在帝国主义分子把日本引向战争道路的阴谋。
    日本人民反对美国占领日本、反对美国把日本做为美国的殖民地和军事基地；亚洲人民也反对美国利用日本侵略亚洲、实行“亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策。因此，日本人民反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的斗争决不是孤立的。中国人民以及所有爱好和平的亚洲人民，将坚决地和日本人民站在一起，为保卫亚洲和世界和平，为彻底摧毁侵略日本、侵略亚洲、危害世界的帝国主义势力而奋斗到底！岸信介集团甘心充当美国侵略政策的工具，与日本人民为敌、与亚洲人民为敌，是肯定不会有前途的，它必将遭到广大亚洲人民首先是日本人民的唾弃，必不可免地进一步沦为亚洲的孤儿！
