　　When you travel along the highway from Zhangjiakou to Inner Mongolia, and climb the Wanquan Dam at an altitude of 1,800 meters, you will see snow-capped peaks and continuous stretches of snow, like silver spread all over the ground. Continue along the highway for another thirty *li*, and you will reach Zhangbei County. This was originally a desolate and sparsely populated broken city, but now it has established sugar factories, soap factories, pharmaceutical factories, mechanical manufacturing factories... It has even made generators, radios, lathes... for the first time. Power stations have been built in towns and large villages, and dazzling electric lights have been lit.

　　This is a natural and good pasture. Look! Red cattle and white sheep dot the entire grassland. The fat sheep and beef cattle here supply the people of Zhangjiakou, Beijing, and Tianjin with meat. The Zhangbei horse is even more outstanding. It has strong bones, developed muscles, and soft fur, and has been famous at home and abroad for a long time.

　　Deep in the grassland, there are countless natural *nao* (small lakes), like sapphires dotted on the grassland. For many years, these *nao* have lain silently, becoming the habitat of swans and various water birds. No one has ever explored their secrets, and they are called the dead water of the turbulent Xian Hai Zi (Salty Sea). Now, the *nao* are breeding fish and shrimp, becoming fish warehouses on the grassland. People are busy tidying up fishing nets, repairing boats, and preparing to go down to the *nao* to fish.

　　The warm southeast wind blows slowly, and the snow gradually melts. Amidst the song of "The Scenery of Sai Bei Grassland is Good," people are busy preparing for spring plowing. Red flags are flying everywhere, and piles of fertilizer are scattered all over the black and oily land...

    塞北春光
    孟尚智
    当你顺着张家口通往内蒙古的公路线前进，爬上海拔一千八百公尺的万全坝，便可以看到遍地白银似的积雪，连绵不断的雪峰。顺公路再走三十里，就到达张北县城。这里原是一座人烟稀少的荒凉破城，现在已经建立了糖厂、肥皂厂、制药厂、机械制造厂……。还破天荒制成了发电机、收音机、车床……。城镇和大型村庄中都盖起了发电站，燃起了耀眼的电灯。
    这里是一片天然的好牧场。看吧！红色的牛群，白色的羊群，布满整个草原。这里的肥羊、菜牛供应张家口和北京、天津人民的肉食。张北马更是出色。它有健壮的骨胳，发达的肌肉，细软的皮毛，长久以来驰名中外。
    草原深处，有无数的天然水淖，像蓝宝石似的点缀在草原上。多少年来，这些水淖无声无息地躺着，成了鸿雁和各种水鸟的栖身之处，从来谁也没有探测过它的秘密，称之为死水狂澜的咸海子。现在呢，淖里养了鱼、虾，成了草原上的鱼仓。人们正在忙着收拾鱼网，检修船只，准备下淖打鱼。
    温暖的东南风缓缓吹来，积雪渐渐融化。在“塞北草原风光好”的歌声中，人们正忙着准备春耕。遍地红旗招展，肥料一堆挨一堆，布满了黑油油的大地……
