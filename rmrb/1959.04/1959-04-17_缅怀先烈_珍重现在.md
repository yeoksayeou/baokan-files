　　Cherishing the Memory of Martyrs and Cherishing the Present
    With deep emotion, I read the "Anthology of Poems by Revolutionary Martyrs" serially published in the People's Daily. The solemn and awe-inspiring faces of the martyrs appeared before me from every line of poetry: their infinite loyalty to the cause of the Party, their unyielding and dauntless will in the face of adversity, their contempt for the enemy under the reactionary butcher knives, and their belief in the inevitable victory of the Party and the people... All of this gave me a profound education. This is not ordinary poetry; it is poetry written by the martyrs with their lives, poetry written with blood.
    The victory of the Chinese revolution did not come easily. It was the result of countless martyrs shedding their blood and throwing their heads. How many people paid precious lives for today's victory. However, does everyone realize how precious today's happy life is? Among our young people, there are still some (or not very strong) who have not experienced the hard life like the martyrs, and have not suffered the painful oppression, so their feeling of today's happy and beautiful life is not strong; some individuals, although they have experienced cruel struggles and hard life, but because of the passage of time and the stable living environment, they are gradually forgetting the past and even growing some individualism. I think that after reading these poems written by the martyrs with blood and life, it will stimulate people's awareness, and will make people more truly understand the preciousness of our present life, and more experience that our victory did not come easily.
    Recently, publishing houses have successively published books in this regard, which is a very good thing. We hope to read more of these works that inspire people to move forward.

### 缅怀先烈  珍重现在

　　缅怀先烈  珍重现在
    我怀着深沉的激动读了人民日报陆续发表的“革命烈士诗钞”，先烈们庄严凛烈的面容从每一行诗句里展现在我的面前：他们对党的事业的无限忠贞、他们临难不屈视死如归的坚毅意志，在反动派的屠刀下面，他们蔑视敌人和坚信党和人民的必将胜利的信念……，所有这一切都给予了我深刻的教育。这不是一般的诗，是先烈用生命写成的诗，用血写成的诗。
    中国革命的胜利，得来是极不容易的，它是无数先烈抛热血、掷头颅的结果，多少人为着今天的胜利付出了宝贵的生命。然而是否每个人都意识到今天幸福的生活可贵呢？我们的青年人中，没有经过像先烈们那样的艰苦生活，还没有身受过那种惨痛的压迫，因而对今天生活幸福美好的感觉不强烈的人（或者不很强烈）仍然是有的；个别人虽然经过残酷斗争和艰苦的生活，但因为岁月的推移和安定的生活环境而对过去日渐忘怀甚至滋长一些个人主义的人也是有的，我想当读了这些先烈们用血和生命写成的诗以后，会激发人们的觉悟，会使人更加真正理解我们现在生活的可贵，更加体验到我们的胜利得来不易。
    最近出版社陆续出版这方面的书籍，这是一个非常好的事情，我们希望能更多的读到这些激发人们前进的作品。
