Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 25th: The Cambodian "Fatherland" newspaper said today that relations between India and China are quite tense over the Tibetan rebellion. The people of Asia and Africa hope that these two elder brothers of Asia should avoid division on this issue.

This newspaper believes the Tibetan rebellion is China's internal affair. However, it also implies that India should intervene. It says that one cannot deny Prime Minister Nehru's "courageous" performance in this atmosphere.

Referring to the meeting between Nehru and the Dalai Lama, the newspaper said that this meeting placed a heavy responsibility on Nehru's shoulders. In its view, the head of the Indian government should adopt an attitude that neither infringes on China's internal affairs nor fails to provide the Tibetan people and Tibetan believers with a "fair and humane" solution.

The "Cambodian Telegraph" believed on the 24th that China's "moral sovereignty" over Tibet is recognized by most countries. The newspaper described the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion and the Indian government's granting of "asylum" to the Dalai Lama and "prohibition" of him from engaging in political activities as "temporarily ending a painful episode in Tibetan history."

The newspaper also referred to Tibet as a "country," demanding that Chinese leaders "seize this opportunity to explain to the world what actually happened in Tibet" and demanding the reconstruction of the autonomous regime of this "country" after the restoration of calm.

    柬埔寨报纸表示两面态度
    既说不愿印中交恶又暗示印度应干预中国内政
    新华社金边25日电　柬埔寨“祖国报”今天说，在西藏叛乱的事件中，印度和中国的关系是颇为紧张的。亚非人民希望亚洲的这两位老大哥应当避免在这种问题上发生分裂。
    这家报纸认为西藏叛乱问题是中国的内部事务。但是它又暗示印度应当进行干预。它说，人们不能否认尼赫鲁总理在这种气氛下的“勇敢”表现。
    这家报纸在谈到尼赫鲁和达赖喇嘛的会谈时说，这次会谈使尼赫鲁肩负了沉重的责任。按照它的看法，印度政府首脑应当采取这样一种态度：既表示不侵犯中国的内政，同时又要给予西藏人和西藏的信徒一个“公正和人道”的解决办法。
    “柬埔寨电讯报”24日认为，中国对西藏地方的“道义上的主权”是大部分国家所承认的。这家报纸把西藏叛乱被平息和印度政府给予达赖喇嘛“避难”并“禁止”他进行政治活动说做是“暂时结束了西藏历史上的一段痛苦的插曲”。
    这家报纸还把西藏称作“国家”，要求中国领袖们“抓住这个机会向全世界说明在西藏究竟发生了什么”，并且要求在恢复平静以后重建这个“国家”的自治政权。
