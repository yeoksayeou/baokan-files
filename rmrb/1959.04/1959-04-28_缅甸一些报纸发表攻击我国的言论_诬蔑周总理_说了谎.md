Some Burmese Newspapers Publish Statements Attacking Our Country
Falsely Accusing Premier Zhou of "Lying"

Following the publication of the lie-filled and loophole-ridden so-called "Dalai Lama's Statement," the United States Information Service has been deliberately seeking out certain newspapers to widely publicize reactionary remarks attacking China using this "statement," including statements from some Burmese newspapers that damage Burmese-Chinese friendship and attack China.

The "Burma Times" absurdly slandered and distorted Premier Zhou Enlai's report at the National People's Congress, going so far as to assert that "from what Zhou Enlai said... we understand that Red China has formulated a plan to turn Tibet into a colony." This newspaper, ignoring the Chinese government's consistent respect for religious freedom, slandered China for "strangling" Buddhism and "persecuting religion."

The "Burma New Light of Burma" avoided mentioning the well-documented fact that the Dalai Lama was abducted by a small group of rebellious elements in Tibet, instead falsely accusing Premier Zhou Enlai of "lying about the Dalai Lama's escape from Lhasa." This newspaper also distorted the facts, saying, "Now no one will believe that there is religious freedom in Tibet," and "to say that there is religious freedom in countries controlled by them (the Communists) is either a joke or a fabrication."

The "Voice of the Peacock" even more blatantly used the so-called "Dalai Lama's Statement" to incite religious sentiments. It fabricated claims that "the Chinese Communists forced the Dalai Lama to flee like a criminal," therefore "this insults the Tibetans and all Buddhists everywhere."

According to reports from Rangoon, the editorial department of the Burmese Muslim monthly "Light of the World" published a "statement" on April 23, slandering China for "killing Buddhist lamas and destroying religious buildings," and baselessly claiming that this was an "insult to the religious world."

In an article published on the 25th, the "Rangoon Daily" interpreted the accusation by Li Jishen, a representative of the National People's Congress of China, against Indian expansionism as a "psychological warfare tactic" aimed at "threatening and stopping Indian newspapers and the Indian government from mentioning and interfering in the Tibet issue." However, this article did not comment on the said "interference," but instead "warned" the Chinese people, saying that if China continues to use this "tactic," "it will suffer failure."

This newspaper even preposterously compared the Chinese government's just action of quelling the rebellion in Tibet, which is China's internal affair, to the invasion of Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, and openly interfered in China's internal affairs, demanding that the Chinese government stop suppressing the rebellion in Tibet.

    缅甸一些报纸发表攻击我国的言论
    诬蔑周总理“说了谎”
    新华社27日讯　在谎话连篇、漏洞百出的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”发表以后，美国新闻处刻意搜罗某些报纸利用这项“声明”攻击中国的反动言论大事宣传，其中包括一些缅甸报纸损害缅中人民友谊、攻击中国的言论。
    “缅甸时报”荒诞地诬蔑歪曲周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会上的报告，竟至于硬说，“从周恩来所说的话……我们了解，赤色中国已经制定了把西藏变成殖民地的计划”。这家报纸无视中国政府一贯尊重宗教自由这一事实，诽谤中国“扼杀”佛教，“迫害宗教”。
    “缅甸新光报”避而不谈有大量事实证明的达赖喇嘛是被西藏一小撮叛乱分子劫持的这一事实，反而诬蔑周恩来总理在“达赖喇嘛逃出拉萨这件事上说了谎”。这家报纸还歪曲事实说，“现在谁也不会相信西藏有宗教自由”，“说他们（共产党）控制的国家中有宗教自由，那不是笑话就是假造的故事”。
    “孔雀之声报”更加露骨地利用所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”煽动宗教情绪。它无中生有地说，“中国共产党人迫使达赖喇嘛像一个罪犯似地逃跑”，因此“这侮辱了西藏人以及各个地方的所有佛教徒”。
    另据仰光消息，缅甸穆斯林的“世界之光”月刊编辑部4月23日发表“声明”，诽谤中国“杀害佛教喇嘛和毁坏宗教建筑物”，胡说什么这是对“宗教世界的侮辱”。
    “仰光日报”在25日发表的文章中，把中国全国人民代表大会代表李济深对印度扩张主义的指责，解释为“心理战的策略”，目的是要“威胁和阻止印度报纸和印度政府，使他们不要再提到和干涉西藏问题”。然而，这篇文章对它所说的这种“干涉”不置一词，反而“警告”中国人民，说什么中国再继续使用这种“战术”，“就将遭受失败”。
    这家报纸竟信口雌黄地把中国政府平息西藏叛乱这一属于中国内政的正义行动，同英、法和以色列三国侵略埃及相提并论，而且公然干涉中国内政，要中国政府停止平息西藏的叛乱。
