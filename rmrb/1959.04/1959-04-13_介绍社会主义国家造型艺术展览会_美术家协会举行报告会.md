　　Introducing the Socialist Countries' Fine Arts Exhibition
　　Fine Arts Association Holds Report Meeting

　　(Our newspaper reports) To introduce the Socialist Countries' Fine Arts Exhibition and the discussion meeting, the Chinese Fine Arts Association held a report meeting on the morning of April 9th, attended by more than 160 people from the art world. The report meeting was presided over by Wu Zuoren, Vice Chairman of the Fine Arts Association and President of the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

　　The Socialist Countries' Fine Arts Exhibition has been open in Moscow since December 26th of last year, and has been visited by more than 500,000 people. Before the closing of the exhibition, members of the Exhibition Committee and representatives of the art circles of various brotherly countries held a discussion meeting in Moscow from March 24th to 26th.

　　At the report meeting, Comrade Cai Ruohong first pointed out the great significance and role of this exhibition. He said that this exhibition shows the high prosperity of the socialist countries' art cause. Through the holding of this exhibition, it will inevitably promote the further development of fine arts. When capitalist countries use chimpanzees and earthworms to paint, making art degenerate into an absurd game, the holding of this exhibition actually safeguards the dignity of progressive human culture and art.

　　Next, Comrade Cai Ruohong gave a detailed introduction to many excellent works exhibited by the brotherly countries. He said that from these works, we can see the close connection between the art of socialist countries and the people; we can see the good performance of the combination of socialist content and national style; at the same time, it also proves with facts the unparalleled superiority of the socialist realism creative method.

　　Finally, Comrade Cai Ruohong introduced the situation of the discussion meeting and the evaluation of the works exhibited by China by the artists of brotherly countries. He said that these opinions are very beneficial to the development and improvement of Chinese art.

　　Comrade Wang Chaowen made a supplementary speech on the great achievements of the Socialist Countries' Fine Arts Exhibition.

　　The artists present were all encouraged by the success of this exhibition and expressed their willingness to work with the artists of the brotherly countries to contribute their strength to the further development of socialist art.

　　介绍社会主义国家造型艺术展览会
　　美术家协会举行报告会
    本报讯　为介绍社会主义国家造型艺术展览会及讨论会情况，中国美术家协会在4月9日上午举行了报告会，到会美术界人士一百六十余人。报告会由美协副主席、中央美术学院院长吴作人主持。
    社会主义国家造型艺术展览会自去年12月26日在莫斯科开幕以来，观众已达五十余万人。在展览会闭幕之前，展览委员会委员及各兄弟国家美术界代表，曾于3月24日至26日在莫斯科举行了讨论会。
    在报告会上，蔡若虹同志首先指出了这个展览会的重大意义和作用。他说，这个展览会显示了社会主义国家美术事业的高度繁荣，通过这个展览会的举行，必然推动造型艺术进一步的发展。当资本主义国家以猩猩、蚯蚓作画，使艺术堕落为荒谬的游戏的时候，这个展览会的举行，实际上是维护了人类进步文化艺术的尊严。
    接着，蔡若虹同志详细介绍了各兄弟国家所展出的许多优秀作品。他说，从这些作品中，可以看出社会主义国家造型艺术与人民的密切联系；可以看出社会主义内容和民族风格相结合的良好表现；同时，也用事实证明了社会主义现实主义创作方法的无比优越性。
    最后，蔡若虹同志介绍了讨论会的情况和兄弟国家美术家对中国展出作品的评价。他说，这些意见对中国造型艺术的发展和提高都是十分有益的。
    王朝闻同志就社会主义国家造型艺术展览会的巨大成就，作了补充发言。
    到会的美术界人士都为这个展览会的成功所鼓舞，表示将和各兄弟国家的美术家一起为社会主义造型艺术进一步的发展，贡献自己的力量。
