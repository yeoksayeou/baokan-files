One Year—Ten Years—Fifty Years
Comrade He Binglin Talks About His Fifty Years of Experience in Running Education

Esteemed committee members,

I am He Binglin, and I have taught books all my life. In my later years, my long-cherished wish has been fulfilled, and I have come to the capital of the motherland to participate in this conference. Looking at the present from the perspective of eighty years, every person, every object, every mountain, and every river expresses the infinitely beautiful youth of the motherland's thriving prosperity. My feelings of surprise and excitement are beyond my ability to express, and I wish to share them with all of you present.

I was a Xiucai in the late Qing Dynasty. I felt that the country was weak, the people were poor, and we were being bullied. I was determined to become stronger, feeling that every person had a responsibility. I studied electrical engineering in Japan. I thought that developing science was the way to save the country, and cultivating talents was the most urgent task. After returning to China, I did not participate in any political activities and concentrated on running schools. It was fragmented and disorganized for more than fifty years. Before liberation, what was the situation in China like? Only broken mountains and rivers, scarred and full of wounds, I think all of you present will not forget. Just take my private school as an example, it was also full of hardships, hard to express in a few words. First, it was not allowed to register, then there were no funds, school buildings and equipment were all lacking. In the first three years, the school site was moved six times, and the principal was changed five times. Everyone regarded it as a daunting task, and the school was in imminent danger of closing down. After the Xinhai Revolution, warlord melee, and the War of Resistance Against Japan, the school was moved several times, wandering and displaced. There were almost no government subsidies, and the funds were stretched. Sometimes, like-minded people donated everywhere (Mr. Chen Yicheng helped the most), and sometimes, teachers and staff pooled their resources and did their best. It was unspeakably bitter, running around and appealing, but few people paid attention. With great difficulty, we bowed and scraped together a team, begged and borrowed to get some houses and furniture, hoping to let the students read a few books quietly. Alas! Even this little good thing, from the Northern Warlords to the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, would not let us do it, and they did everything possible to obstruct and restrict it. The Kuomintang lords often wanted to station troops in the school, causing turmoil and unrest. When scholars meet soldiers, there is no reasoning to be had, so we had to retreat and say good things to them. After they left, even the tables, chairs and benches were smashed to pieces, and we had to work hard to clean up from scratch. It was really not knowing how to get through the next semester after one semester had passed. Comrades, in the old society, it was not easy for teachers to teach a few books, and it was not easy for students to read a few books! I am a stubborn person. The more setbacks I encounter, the more I temper my will to run the school unremittingly. The greater the difficulties, the more I develop my spirit of enjoying it. Strange! The more I tried to save the country, the more unsalvageable the country became; the more I tried to run the school, the more difficult it became. At that time, I didn't understand why the path of saving the country through science and education was impassable. I groped blindly and unknowingly took a detour for more than forty years.

The situation has been very different in the ten years since liberation. Spring is warm and flowers bloom, songs are sung everywhere, and labor and production are thriving. The Party does not consider me old and decaying, and pays great attention to and cares for me, asking me to continue running the school. This is really easy to do. Everything is available. Teachers, funds, teaching materials, everything is no longer a worry. Education has a direction and a policy. It is clear for whom the students we teach work, and what they do. In the past, we cultivated some "pale-faced scholars." Whether they could do things, and for whom they worked, depended on luck. Now we cultivate laborers who are capable of both writing and fighting, have socialist consciousness, and are cultured. One graduate is a good cadre who serves the people. I have seen our schools being established in batches, and our students growing up in groups, shouldering the important task of building the motherland, and surpassing their predecessors. I have been a middle school principal since the late Qing Dynasty and still am now. Only the ten years after liberation have been the smoothest and most enjoyable. I dare not fail the Party's trust in me. I still get up early every morning, climb mountains to exercise, check classes, look at teaching, attend meetings, supervise homework, and do not want to be negligent in the slightest. I am now running the school with more and more energy, my eyes are getting brighter and brighter, my ears are getting smarter and smarter, I am walking briskly, and I am getting younger and younger. Two years ago, Hunan Province also held a conference for me to celebrate my fifty years of teaching and congratulate me on my eightieth birthday. The Party and the government also gave me awards and certificates, encouraging me to continue to move forward. You see, now the Party gives a teacher such high honor, and the people give a teacher such great glory. Looking back on the past and looking at the present, how gratified my heart should be!

Last year was a year of the Great Leap Forward. This leap was really a big leap, a fast leap, a good leap, and a saving leap. No one thought that a people's commune would also leap out, where "eating is free." The school I run is in the Hengshan Commune. You can go there and see: With broken beams and dilapidated tiles, a pig farm that can accommodate 10,000 fat pigs was built without spending a penny; without engineers, instruments were self-made, and a large reservoir that irrigates more than 40,000 mu of land was repaired; starting from scratch, all kinds of factories were established. It is really "The commune has great power, managing the sky, the earth, the mountains and the waters; the masses have full enthusiasm, chasing the stars, chasing the moon, chasing the sun." I never thought that the world of great harmony where "the old are cared for, the young are nurtured, and the strong are employed," which Confucius did not see, Kang Youwei did not see, He Binglin and all of you present have actually seen. Is this a simple matter? I remember that Hengshan Commune has such a couplet: "The earth composes songs, the mountains and rivers compose music, singing endlessly the benefits of the Communist Party; the white clouds are paper, the sea water is ink, writing endlessly the kindness of Chairman Mao." This couplet is enough to represent the hearts of the 600 million people of the country and Binglin's heart.

I am eighty-three years old this year. I have never thought about retiring, nor have I ever thought about a life of enjoying my old age. With the all-round leap forward, I, He Binglin, also want to leap forward. I want to live another eighty-three years, doubling it. I am a feudal intellectual, and I have also made a leap forward plan. I want to continue to transform myself, continue to accept new things, and continue to learn from our students. I have never participated in any political parties in my life. In 1957, the Party asked me to do more work in the education field to unite intellectuals. I gladly accepted and joined the China Association for Promoting Democracy. The democratic parties are doing good things for the socialist society under the leadership of the Party, not the Kuomintang forming parties for personal gain and doing bad things. Why shouldn't I do it? I am not old, and my heart is even less old; my body is not weak, and my ambition is even less weak. I want to continue to stick to this education post, cultivate some promising talents for the socialist motherland, and educate some outstanding sons and daughters for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, giving my all, striving forward, and wishing to encourage and encourage each other with all of you.

    一年—十年—五十年
    何炳麟委员谈五十年来办教育的经历各位委员：
    我是何炳麟，教了一辈子书。晚年得遂素愿，来到祖国首都，参加这次大会，八十年来看今朝，一人一物，一山一水，都表达了祖国欣欣向荣无限美妙的青春，惊喜兴奋之情，曷能自已，愿与到会诸位一吐为快。
    我是前清的一个秀才，感到国弱民穷，受人欺侮，发愤图强，匹夫有责，曾留学日本，研究电学。自以为发展科学是救国之道，培养人材是当务之急，回国之后，什么政治活动都不参加，专心办学。支离破碎，搞了五十多年，解放前的四十年，中国是一幅什么样的情景，剩水残山，疮痍满目，我想在座诸公，不会忘怀。就拿我私人办学来说，也是历尽艰辛，一言难尽。先是不准立案，继则经费无着，校舍设备，一应全无，开始三年，六迁校址，五易校长，人皆视为畏途，学校岌岌乎不可终日。经过辛亥革命、军阀混战、抗日战争，学校又几经迁徙，辗转流离。政府津贴，几乎没有，经费左支右绌，有时是志同道合者四处捐输，（陈宜诚先生帮助最多），有时是师生职工东挪西凑，倾家纾难，苦不堪言，奔走呼号，人少理睬。好容易作揖打拱，拼凑起一个班子，求前借后，搞到一点房屋家具，想使学生安安静静读几句书。唉！就是这一点点好事，从北洋军阀以至蒋介石反动派，都不让我们做，阻挠限制，无所不用其极。国民党老爷经常要在学校驻军，闹得你鸡犬不宁。秀才遇着兵，有理讲不清，我们只好退避三舍，向他们说尽好话。他们走了，连桌椅板凳，都跟你打得个稀屎八烂，又得辛辛苦苦，从头收拾，真是过了一个学期不知道下一个学期怎么过。诸位，在旧社会，先生想教几句书，学生想读几句书，都是很不容易的事啊！我是个硬性子的人，挫折愈多，愈磨炼我办学不懈的意志，坎坷愈大，愈养成我乐此不疲的精神。奇怪呀！愈救国、国愈不可救，愈办学、学愈难办成，当时我也不懂为什么科学救国、教育救国走不通的道理，瞎摸瞎碰，不知不觉，走了四十多年的弯路。
    解放以来十年，情况就大不相同了。春暖花开，遍地弦歌，劳动生产，一派兴旺景象。党不以我年迈腐朽，非常重视关切，要我继续办学。这一来可真好办了。什么都有了。教员、经费，教材，一切都不用愁了。教育有了方向，有了方针，教出来的学生为甚么人做事，做甚么事，都明确了。从前我们培养的是一些“白面书生”，能不能做事，替什么人做事，要听碰。现在我们培养的是能文能武、有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者，出来一个就是一个为人民服务的好干部。我眼看到我们的学校成批的兴办起来，我们的学生成群的成长起来，肩负着建设祖国的重任，青出于蓝而胜于蓝。我从清末起当中学校长，一直当到现在。就只有解放后的十年当得最顺手，最痛快。我不敢辜负党对我的信任，我每天仍然清晨即起，爬山锻炼，查课堂，看教学，参加会议，督促作业，不愿少有懈怠。我现在办学是越办越有劲，眼睛越看越亮了，耳朵越听越聪明了，走路健步如飞，年纪也越活越年轻了。前两年，湖南省还特为我举办了一个庆祝五十教龄的大会，祝贺我八十岁生日。党和政府还发给我奖品奖状，勉励我继续前进。你们看，如今党给一个教师这么高的荣誉，人民给一个教师这么大的光荣，抚今追昔，我的心灵该是多么的欣慰啊！
    去年一年，是大跃进的一年。这一跃，可真跃得多，跃得快，跃得好，跃得省。谁也没有想到，还会跃出一个人民公社来，“吃饭不要钱”。我办的学校就在南岳公社，诸位可以到那里去看看：残椽败瓦，不花一文钱，就建成了一座容纳万头肥猪的养猪场；没有工程师，自制仪器，就修好了灌溉四万多亩田地的大水库；白手起家，就举办了各式各样的工厂。真是“公社力量大，管天管地管山水；群众干劲足，追星追月追太阳。”想不到“老有所终，幼有所养，壮有所用”的大同世界，孔夫子没有看到，康有为也没有看到，我何炳麟和在座诸公竟看到了。这难道是一件简单的事情吗？记得衡山公社有这么一副对联：“大地编歌，山河谱曲，唱不完共产党的好处；白云当纸，海水作墨，写不尽毛主席的恩情”。这副对联适足以代表全国六亿人民和炳麟的心意。
    我今年八十三岁了。我从未想到要退休，也从未想到过那以娱晚景的生活。全面跃进，我何炳麟也要跃进。我还想再活八十三岁，翻它一番。我是一个封建知识分子，我也订了跃进规划，还要继续改造，还要努力接受新鲜事物，还要向我们的学生学习。我平生从未参加过任何党派，一九五七年，党要我在教育界中多作一点团结知识分子的工作，我欣然接受，参加了中国民主促进会。民主党派是在党的领导下为社会主义社会做好事的，又不是国民党结党营私办坏事的，我为什么不干呢？我年未老，心更未老；体未衰，志更不衰。我还要继续坚持这个教育岗位，为社会主义祖国培养出一些大有作为的人材，为共产党和毛主席多教养出一些优秀的儿女来，鞠躬尽瘁，奋勇迈进，愿与诸位共勖共勉。
