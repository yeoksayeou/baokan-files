    Lenin Lives Forever
    —After Viewing the Film "The Story of Lenin"
    Yu Ji
    The great revolutionary teacher Lenin dedicated his life to the cause of the proletarian revolution and the liberation of mankind. His immortal image has been vividly reproduced in many Soviet films. The film "The Story of Lenin" is more like a cordial and moving memoir. Through two life fragments of different nature, it shows Lenin's ideological style that is "as simple as truth."
    The first fragment narrates the events before the October Revolution. After the "July Crisis" in 1917, the bourgeoisie, Mensheviks, and Socialist-Revolutionaries colluded to launch a frantic attack on the Bolsheviks: they destroyed the editorial office of "Pravda," slandered Lenin as a "German spy," and then ordered Lenin's arrest. The Bolshevik Party Central Committee decided that Lenin should temporarily leave Petrograd. He moved several times until he hid in that eternally memorable small shed by Lake Razliv. Here, Lenin maintained close contact with the Party Central Committee, preparing for the armed uprising; and in that wilderness he called his "open-air office"—among the weeds and old tree roots—as we see in a famous painting—he wrote many articles, never stopping his fight against the enemy for a minute; enabling the proletariat to hear the voice of its leader in time, just as the poet Mayakovsky felt: "Although Lenin is gone; he is right nearby." The immortal work "State and Revolution" was born in such difficult circumstances. For the enemy, Lenin's existence was the greatest danger. Therefore, they vainly attempted to separate Lenin's name from the people with endless slanders, and vainly attempted to snatch their own leader from the people's hands with incessant searches. However, the people responded to the enemy's despicable and foolish tricks with their own actions. Party member Yemelyanov and Lenin's little "sentries"—the two shrewd brothers Seryozha, who skillfully mastered the "special communication signals"—cleverly and bravely protected Lenin's safety. Their actions reflected the will and desire of all party members and working people.
    This story truly shows Lenin's wisdom to see through everything, his optimistic and heroic character, and his tenacious fighting spirit, reflecting the flesh-and-blood relationship between Lenin and the people; it also describes how Lenin's key to truth opened a blinded heart. The story interweaves the ideological evolution of the enemy soldier Mukhin: he came into contact with the truth from Lenin's simple family life, understood the truth from the origin of Lenin and his wife's pair of copper rings, and especially from the Bolsheviks' proposition on the "land" issue, the truth took root in his heart. Thus, he transformed from an enemy soldier searching for Lenin to standing on Lenin's side. This small episode demonstrates that Lenin's truth is an invincible force.
    This story ends when Lenin moved from Razliv to Finland again.
    The second fragment narrates the last few months of Lenin's life—from his serious illness to his convalescence in Gorki, until January 21, 1924, the moment mourned by working people all over the world.
    This story is "a work full of truly poetic inspiration" constructed by the author based on historical facts and rich imagination. The author describes not only Lenin's sickbed life, but also truly reflects Lenin's love for life, concern for people, and tireless struggle for the victory of the proletariat under any circumstances. It does not narrate Lenin's death, but praises Lenin's eternal life.
    There are several exciting scenes in the work: when the nurse Sasha introduced Lenin's condition to the workers, the atmosphere in the workshop was always worried, anxious, and unbearably uneasy, until Sasha announced that Lenin's condition had improved and he could take a walk every morning—instantly, the emotional rhythm of the people changed dramatically, and people shed tears, applauded, and sang the "Internationale" to bless Lenin's health. This scene truly expresses the sincere feelings of the working people sharing weal and woe and breathing together with Lenin.
    In this story, there is also a beautiful and dramatic interlude, which is the love affair of the nurse Sasha. When Sasha unreservedly confided her troubles to Lenin, it felt like a little daughter was telling her father her innermost feelings. Lenin comforted her, encouraged her, and approved her marriage to Guria in his own name. While relieving Sasha's troubles, Lenin also broke through Belov's (the comrade in charge of security) "blockade" and obtained everything he cared about most. The well-intentioned Belov, in order to ensure Lenin's "absolute tranquility," set the following rules for the nurse Sasha: "Without the doctor's permission, no one is allowed to see him (referring to Lenin); no politics can be discussed with him under any circumstances. Do not read newspapers to him or tell him about domestic and foreign events. He absolutely needs tranquility." However, could Lenin tolerate such "tranquility"? Belov also came to a clear conclusion on this point later: "No! Lenin cannot live like this; because he is Lenin!"
    At this time, the opposition took advantage of Lenin's illness to engage in divisive activities. They clamored to abolish party organs, restore factional organizations, and so on. Imperialist propaganda tools also took the opportunity to make trouble, spreading rumors and slandering the Soviet Union. Lenin heard about these situations and resolutely returned to Moscow to participate in a debate meeting in a factory. Just as the opportunists were ranting and raving against the party, Lenin appeared, and his steel-like voice rang in the ears of the workers again. He used sharp words to expose the conspiracy of the opposition. He said: "Demanding factional activities means wanting to destroy the fighting proletarian party! ... This is absolutely impossible! Our party must not be touched!" Our party must not be touched, this is Lenin's lifelong battle cry to defend the party.
    Ruthlessness to the enemy and love for the people are Lenin's distinct character traits. Even when he was recuperating, we still saw him decorating the New Year's fir tree for the local children; we heard his cordial conversation with the Ural delegation. When he saw that Mukhin (the soldier in the first story) had become the foreman of the workshop, he said: "Blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and steel are of course all very good. But the most important thing is this Mukhin!" That is to say, the most important thing is the growth of people. Lenin loved life and loved people in this way until he completed the road of his life.
    Lenin passed away. However, his glorious image will forever live in people's hearts. Let us bravely face our future and fight like Lenin!

    列宁永生
    ——影片“列宁的故事”观后
    虞棘
    伟大的革命导师列宁，把自己的一生献给了无产阶级革命和人类解放的事业。他的不朽的形象，已在许多部苏联影片中栩栩如生地再现了出来。“列宁的故事”这部影片，则更像一篇亲切动人的回忆录。通过两个不同性质的生活片断，展示了列宁的“像真理一样质朴”的思想风貌。
    第一个片断，叙述的是十月革命以前的事。1917年“七月事变”以后，资产阶级和孟什维克、社会革命党人勾结在一起，向布尔什维克猖狂地进攻：捣毁了“真理报”编辑部，污蔑列宁是“德国间谍”，接着便是下令逮捕列宁。布尔什维克党中央决定，列宁暂时离开彼得格勒。他经过几度转移，直到隐蔽在拉兹里夫湖边那个永远有纪念意义的小草棚里。列宁在这里和党中央保持着密切联系，准备武装起义；并且在那被他称做“露天办公室”的荒草丛中、老树根上——像我们在一幅名画里看到的那样——写了许多篇论文，一分钟也不停止地同敌人进行战斗；使得无产阶级及时地听到了自己的领袖的声音，正如诗人马雅可夫斯基感受的那样：“虽然列宁不见了；但是他就在近旁。”“国家与革命”这篇不朽的著作，也就是在这样艰苦的环境里诞生的。对敌人说来，列宁的存在就是最大的危险。于是，他们妄想用无休止的诽谤把列宁的名字和人民分开，妄想用不间歇的搜查从人民手里夺去人民自己的领袖。然而，人民却用自己的行动回击了敌人这种卑鄙而愚蠢的伎俩。党员叶米里扬诺夫和列宁的小“哨兵”——那巧妙地掌握了“特殊联络信号”的小谢廖沙哥儿俩，机智、勇敢地保卫了列宁的安全。他们的行为，反映了全体党员和劳动人民的意志和愿望。
    这个故事，真实地展现了列宁的洞察万物的智慧、乐观豪迈的性格和顽强斗争的精神，反映了列宁与人民的血肉相连的关系；同时还描写了列宁的真理的钥匙，如何打开了一个被蒙蔽的心灵。故事中穿插了敌人士兵穆欣的思想演变过程：他从列宁的俭朴的家庭生活中接触了真理，从列宁和他夫人的那对铜戒指的来历中认识了真理，尤其从布尔什维克对“土地”问题的主张中，更使得真理扎进了他的心里。于是，他从一个搜捕列宁的敌兵一变而站到列宁的这方面来。这个小小的插曲，展示了列宁的真理是不可战胜的力量。
    这个故事，写到列宁又从拉兹里夫迁往芬兰的时候结束了。
    第二个片断，叙述的是列宁一生中最后几个月的生活——从病重到哥尔克休养，直到1924年1月21日这个为全世界劳动人民所痛悼的时刻。
    这个故事，是作者根据史实和丰富的想像结构成的一个“充满真正诗的灵感的作品”。作者描写的不只是列宁的病榻生活，而是真实地反映了列宁在任何情况下都是热爱生活、关心人、永不疲倦地为无产阶级的胜利而斗争。不是叙述列宁的逝世，而是歌颂列宁永生。
    作品中有这样几个激动人心的场面：当护士莎沙向工人们介绍列宁病况时，车间的气氛一直是忧虑、焦急和难忍的不安，直到莎沙宣布列宁病情好转，已经能每天早晨出来散步了——霎时，人们的情感节奏立刻起了急剧的变化，人们流着泪、鼓着掌、唱起“国际歌”来为列宁的健康祝福。这个场面，真切地表达了劳动人民和列宁共安危、同呼吸的真挚的感情。
    在这个故事里，也穿插着一支优美的富有戏剧性的插曲，就是护士莎沙的爱情事件。当莎沙毫无拘束地向列宁倾吐自己的烦恼时，使人感觉到：仿佛是一个小女儿正在向父亲诉说衷肠。列宁安慰着她、鼓励着她，并且以自己的名义批准了她和郭里亚结婚。与解除莎沙的烦恼同时，列宁也突破了贝洛夫（负责警卫工作的同志）的“封锁线”，得到了他最关心的一切。好心的贝洛夫，为了保证列宁的“绝对安静”，他给护士莎沙定下的律条是：“没有医生的许可，不能让任何人来看他（指列宁）；无论如何不能对他谈政治。不给他读报，不对他讲国内外的事件。他绝对需要安静。”然而，列宁能容忍这样的“安静”吗？这一点，贝洛夫在后来也得出了明确的结论：“不！列宁不能这样生活；因为他是列宁！”
    就在这个时候，反对派利用列宁卧病的时机大搞分裂活动。他们叫嚣着要取消党的机关，恢复派别组织，等等。帝国主义的宣传工具也趁机捣乱，大肆造谣污蔑苏联。列宁听到了这些情况，毅然回到了莫斯科，参加了一个工厂的辩论大会。正当机会主义者在摇唇鼓舌地进行着反党的叫嚣，列宁出现了，他那钢铁般的声音又在工人们耳边响起来了。他用犀利的语句戳穿了反对派的阴谋。他说：“要求派别活动，就是想要毁灭战斗的无产阶级政党！……这绝对办不到！不许动我们的党！”不许动我们的党，这是列宁毕生为保卫党而发出的战斗号召。
    对敌人的无情和对人民的热爱，是列宁的鲜明的性格特征。即便在他养病的时候，我们还看到了他为当地孩子们布置的新年枞树；听到了他和乌拉尔代表团的亲切谈话。当他看到穆欣（第一个故事里的那个士兵）已经当了车间的工长，他说：“高炉、平炉、钢材，这当然都很好。但最主要的还是这个穆欣！”也就是说最主要的是人的成长。列宁就是这样地热爱生活、热爱人，直到他走完了自己一生的道路。
    列宁逝世了。但是，他的光辉的形象却永远活在人们心里。让我们勇敢地面向着自己的未来，像列宁那样战斗吧！
