Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 15th: Since the Tibetan rebellion, the Indian English-language newspaper "Indian Express" has continuously published many fallacies, viciously slandering and attacking China.

As early as March 23, the newspaper published an editorial which nonsensically claimed that the Tibetan "rebellion was basically caused by the Tibetans' resistance to Beijing's 'infiltration,' 'indoctrination,' and 'domination' methods, using immigrants, officials, and soldiers to colonize Tibet according to familiar communist practices." It said, "India recognizes China's suzerainty over Tibet, but not its sovereignty."

When China's State Council Premier Zhou Enlai issued an order to dissolve the rebellious organization, the Tibetan local government, this newspaper expressed being "shocked" in a March 29 commentary and randomly attacked China for "violating the spirit of Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence)."

By April 2, the newspaper further slandered China for carrying out "expansion in this region of the world," saying that "the threat to buffer states is the prelude to conflict between the largest neighbors."

On April 4, the newspaper clamored, "China may be able to force Lhasa to surrender, but New Delhi is not afraid." An article published in the same day by this newspaper slandered: "Throughout their entire history, the Chinese have never treated other ethnic groups equally, and in the view of many, even under the rule of the Communist regime, China remains China surrounded by barbarians."

The editor-in-chief of this newspaper, Moryas, also serves as the "chairman" of the so-called "Support Tibet People Committee" established on March 27.

    “印度快报”连续发表谬论
    借题对我国大肆诽谤
    新华社15日讯　新德里消息：在西藏叛乱事件发生以后，印度的一家英文大报“印度快报”曾经连续发表许多谬论，恶毒地污蔑和攻击中国。
    这家报纸早在3月23日发表的社论就胡说什么西藏“叛乱基本上是由于西藏人反抗北京按照‘渗入’、‘灌输’和‘统治’这些熟悉的共产党方法，以移民、官员和士兵来使西藏殖民化的做法而引起的”。它说，“印度承认中国在西藏享有宗主权，但不享有主权”。
    当我国务院周恩来总理发布命令解散叛乱的组织者西藏地方政府时，这家报纸在3月29日的评论中表示对此“感到震惊”，并胡乱攻击中国“违反潘查希拉（和平共处五项原则）精神”。
    到4月2日，这家报纸更污蔑中国“在世界这个地区”进行“扩张”，它说什么“对缓冲国家的威胁是最大的邻国之间发生冲突的前奏。”
    4月4日，这家报纸叫嚷说，“中国也许可以迫使拉萨投降，但是新德里是不怕的。”这家报纸在同一天刊载的一篇文章污蔑说：“在他们的整个历史中，中国人从来没有平等地对待其他民族，而且在许多人看来，甚至在共产党政权统治之下，中国仍旧是野蛮人包围的中国”。
    这家报纸的主编摩里亚斯还担任了在3月27日成立的所谓“支援西藏人民委员会”的“主席”。
