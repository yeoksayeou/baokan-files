Iraqi Minister of Education, Brigadier General Mohi al-Din Abdul Hamid, said at the signing ceremony of the Sino-Iraqi Cultural Cooperation Agreement on April 4th that the newly signed agreement "will help restore the ancient friendly ties between the two countries, which have a history of thousands of years, and consolidate the friendly cooperation between the two countries. From now on, imperialism can neither undermine the friendly relations between our two countries nor set up obstacles between the people of Iraq and the people of China."
    He said, "There is no doubt that cooperation in culture and science will strengthen friendly understanding between the people who have been liberated, and will promote progress in culture, science, and politics."

    Burhan, head of the Chinese cultural delegation, said in his reply: "We are the first cultural delegation from China, and at the same time, we are friendly envoys of the Chinese people. We are here to sign the first cultural agreement between our two countries, and we have also brought you the friendship of 650 million Chinese people." He expressed the Chinese people's hope to learn from the Iraqi people, who have a long history and culture, and believed that the signing of the agreement would further enhance and strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries.
    He said: "The newly born, heroic Republic of Iraq, under the leadership of Prime Minister Qasim, has repeatedly defeated the subversive conspiracies of imperialism, consolidated the achievements of the national revolution, and is moving towards building a prosperous and strong new Iraq." He said that the cultural and economic construction of China and Iraq will increasingly develop, and the cultural exchanges and friendly cooperation between the two countries will be increasingly strengthened.
