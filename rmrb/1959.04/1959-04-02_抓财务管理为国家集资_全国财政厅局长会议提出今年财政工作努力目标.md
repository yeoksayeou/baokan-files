Xinhua News Agency, April 1st: The Ministry of Finance recently convened a National Conference of Finance Bureau Chiefs which determined that, in order to adapt to the situation of this year's greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country, financial departments must vigorously grasp the financial management work of enterprises, better raise funds, and serve the realization of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, as well as the national economic construction cause, and at the same time vigorously support the consolidation and improvement of the people's communes.

The conference pointed out that, at present, the vast majority of our country's budget revenue comes from state-owned enterprises. Therefore, strengthening the financial work of state-owned enterprises, doing a good job in cost management, and promoting economic accounting are of decisive significance for ensuring the accumulation of funds for socialist construction. The conference requested that in 1959, financial departments at all levels should cooperate closely with planning departments at the same level to further improve cost management work. They should assist enterprises in vigorously reducing costs through technological revolution, saving raw materials and management expenses, improving labor organization, and tapping the potential of existing equipment. And they should adopt the method of the mass line to break down cost targets to the factory and mine levels, and mobilize the masses of workers to implement them. Finance departments in all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should also regularly convene experience exchange meetings on cost management to promote the development of the work.

The conference believes that strengthening the management of working capital is another important task in doing a good job in enterprise financial management. At present, the amount of working capital in the country is very large, and it is necessary to save and use these funds and give full play to its effectiveness. The following points should be noted at present: First, strengthen the planned management of working capital. Supply funds according to the production and circulation tasks stipulated in the national plan to ensure the normal progress of production and circulation. However, while ensuring supply, it is also necessary to promote enterprises to strengthen economic accounting and strengthen the management of working capital, and give full play to the effectiveness of the use of funds. Second, define the scope of use of working capital. Working capital can only be used for production turnover and commodity circulation, and cannot be used for other purposes. Third, seize the work of clearing up working capital.

The conference also discussed strengthening the financial management of capital construction departments, believing that further implementing the investment contract system for capital construction is an important measure to ensure that capital construction is done more, faster, better, and more economically. The conference decided to continue to earnestly implement the investment contract system for capital construction in 1959. In its implementation, it is necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm of the construction departments and to obey the state's planned management. The conference believes that only by earnestly implementing the "nation as a whole" ideology and earnestly implementing the unified national plan can we better give play to the enthusiasm of various departments and units. Therefore, after the implementation of the investment contract system, the construction units must currently ensure the completion of the state's established construction tasks and must not independently reduce important construction projects within the plan. If the state makes major revisions to the original construction plan, the amount of the investment contract should also be adjusted accordingly. If the construction unit uses the funds saved after the investment contract to arrange new projects, it must first report to the planning department for approval and incorporate it into the unified national plan. The conference emphasized that the implementation of investment contracts must ensure the quality of the project and should save funds and expand the scale of construction on the premise of ensuring the service life of the project and safe production.

Regarding the issue of supporting the consolidation and improvement of the people's communes from the perspective of financial work, the conference believes that it is necessary to earnestly implement the state's tax policy, continue to stabilize the agricultural tax burden of the people's communes, and allocate a sum of funds from the national budget to invest in the communes. Financial departments at all levels should also help the people's communes establish and improve financial management systems and do a good job in economic accounting to promote the development of the people's commune economy.

This conference was held in Beijing from March 14th to 28th.

    抓财务管理为国家集资
    全国财政厅局长会议提出今年财政工作努力目标
    据新华社1日讯　财政部最近召开的全国财政厅局长会议确定：为了适应今年我国工农业生产更大跃进的形势，财政部门必须大抓企业财务管理工作，更好地筹集资金，为钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标的实现和国家经济建设事业服务，同时大力支持人民公社的巩固和提高。
    会议指出，目前我国预算收入，绝大部分是来自国营企业，因此，加强国营企业的财务工作，搞好成本管理，促进经济核算，对于保证社会主义建设资金的积累具有决定意义。会议要求，1959年各级财政部门应当与同级计划部门密切协作，进一步把成本管理工作搞好，要协助各企业通过技术革命、节约原材料及管理费用、改善劳动组织、挖掘现有设备潜力等办法，大力降低成本。并且要采取走群众路线的方法，把成本指标层层下达到厂矿，发动职工群众来贯彻实现。各省、市、自治区财政部门还应当定期召开成本管理经验交流会议，推动工作的开展。
    会议认为：加强流动资金的管理是搞好企业财务管理的另一项重要工作，目前全国流动资金的数额很大，必须节约使用这些资金，充分发挥它的使用效果。当前应当注意以下几点：一、加强流动资金的计划管理。根据国家计划规定的生产、流通任务来供应资金，以保证生产和流通的正常进行，但是在保证供应的同时，也必须促进企业加强经济核算，加强对流动资金的管理，充分发挥资金的使用效果。二、划定流动资金的使用范围。流动资金只能用于生产周转和商品流转方面，不能作其他用途。三、抓紧进行流动资金的清理工作。
    会议还讨论了加强基本建设部门的财务管理问题，认为进一步贯彻基本建设的投资包干办法，是保证基本建设多快好省的重要措施。会议决定1959年继续认真推行基本建设投资包干的办法，在执行中既要充分发挥建设部门的积极性，又要服从国家的计划管理。会议认为，只有认真地贯彻“全国一盘棋”思想，切实执行国家的统一计划，才能更好地发挥各部门、各单位的积极性，因此在实行投资包干以后，各建设单位当前保证完成国家既定的建设任务，不能自行削减计划内的重要建设项目；国家对原定的建设方案如有重大修改，投资包干的数额也应当相应地进行调整；建设单位如用投资包干后节约的资金安排新的项目时，必须事先报请计划部门批准后纳入统一的国家计划。会议强调，实行投资包干必须保证工程质量，应当在保证工程使用年限和安全生产的前提下，节约资金和扩大建设规模。
    关于从财政工作上支持人民公社的巩固与提高问题，会议认为，必须认真执行国家的税收政策、继续稳定人民公社的农业税负担，并且要从国家预算中拨出一笔资金向公社投资；各级财政部门还要帮助人民公社建立与健全财务管理制度，搞好经济核算，以促进人民公社经济的发展。
    这次会议是3月14日到28日在北京举行的。
