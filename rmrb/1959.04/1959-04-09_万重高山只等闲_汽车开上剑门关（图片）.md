    Distant Mountains Treated as Level Ground
    Car Drives onto Jianmen Pass
    "Even the Yellow Crane cannot fly over,
    Apes and monkeys fret at climbing."
    This is a verse by the Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai describing the difficulty of the Shu Road.
    In today's Great Leap Forward, the heroic people of the mountainous regions have built road networks in half a month of hard work, realizing motorization. The Shu Road is no longer difficult. As the peasant poet Wei Pinqing wrote:
    “The mountain opposite is called Wanren Ridge,
    It's hard to reach the top, your hat will blow off,
    Today, we have built a road network,
    Cars climb onto the top of your head.”
    Look: A car loaded with goods drives into the Jianmen mountainous area. The products of the mountainous areas can also be transported out by car to support national industrial construction. Photo by Qu Fei (Manuscript from Sichuan Jianmen News)

    万重高山只等闲
    汽车开上剑门关
    “黄鹤之飞尚不过，
    猿猱欲度愁攀缘。”
    这是唐代诗人李白形容蜀道难的诗句。
    在大跃进的今天，英勇的山区人民奋战半月建成了道路网，实现了车子化。蜀道已经不再难了。正如农民诗人魏品清写的：
      “对门山叫万丈岭，
    帽儿吹落难上顶，
    今天修起道路网，
    车子爬上你脑壳顶。”
    看：满载物资的汽车开上了剑门山区。山区的物产也可以一车一车运出去支援国家工业建设。去非摄（四川剑门报稿）
