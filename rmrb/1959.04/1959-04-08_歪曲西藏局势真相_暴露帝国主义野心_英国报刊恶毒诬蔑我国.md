Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th: British bourgeois newspapers have recently been wantonly slandering our country's measures to quell the rebellion in Tibet, and are doing their utmost to provoke peaceful and friendly relations between China and Asian countries.

    British Information Services reports viciously slander China's suppression of the Tibetan armed rebellion as "an example of Chinese imperialism" and "the development of a crude expansionist policy." An editorial in the "Daily Telegraph" openly denies that Tibet is Chinese territory, and even claims that Tibet is an "independent country" and China is a "colonizer."

    Some newspapers are doing their best to distort the truth about the situation in Tibet and the Chinese government's ethnic policies. The "Times" reverses black and white and even describes the Tibetan armed rebellion as "out of a passionate and patriotic desire" and as opposition to Tibet being "annexed." A commentary in the "Observer" on the 5th slandered China for "suppressing the freedom of a weak and non-violent people (referring to Tibet)."

    However, some newspapers have revealed the imperialists' conspiracies and ambitions towards Tibet. The "Manchester Guardian" hopes that the rebels in Tibet will "persist" in "guerrilla warfare" for a "long period of time." An article by George Patterson published in the "Daily Telegraph" on March 30 encouraged Tibetan rebels to "continue fighting until their goals are achieved" in order to "get rid of China." An editorial in this newspaper on April 4 suggested that the West should "seize the fruits" when the time is "ripe."

    Some British newspapers insidiously provoke relations between the Chinese people and Asian countries. The "Daily Mail" slandered China for attempting to "erase Tibet from the map and clear the way for further southward expansion." The "Daily Telegraph" slandered China's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet as "making Asian neutralists think even more about the true value of China's respect for the principles of peaceful coexistence and the Bandung Declaration."

    Some British newspapers also openly incite Asian countries to take actions to interfere in China's internal affairs and be hostile to China. The "Daily Telegraph" said that in the current situation, "action should be taken by Asian neutralist countries," and it advocated that these countries take steps to interfere in China's internal affairs and submit the issue of the situation in Tibet to the United Nations. This newspaper believes that it is necessary to seize the opportunity to "use the current opportunity" to "break" China's influence in Asia. The "News Chronicle" shamelessly incited India to come forward to intervene, saying that if it does not do so, India's "international status" will be "greatly reduced."

    歪曲西藏局势真相　暴露帝国主义野心
    英国报刊恶毒诬蔑我国
    新华社7日讯　伦敦消息：英国资产阶级报刊最近大肆诬蔑我国平定西藏叛乱的措施，并且竭力挑拨中国与亚洲国家的和平友好关系。
    英国新闻处的报道恶毒地诬蔑中国政府平息西藏武装叛乱是“中国帝国主义活动的一个例子”，是粗野的扩张主义政策的发展”。“每日电讯报”的社论公然否认西藏是中国的领土，竟说，西藏是一个“独立的国家”，中国是“殖民者”。
    一些报纸竭力歪曲西藏局势真相和中国政府的民族政策。“泰晤士报”颠倒黑白地竟把西藏武装叛乱说做是“出于一个热情的和爱国的愿望”，是由于反对西藏被“并吞”。“观察家报”5日评论诬蔑中国“压制一个弱小的非暴力人民（指西藏）的自由”。
    但是某些报刊却透露了帝国主义者对西藏的阴谋和野心。“曼彻斯特卫报”希望叛乱分子在西藏“坚持长时期”的“游击战争”。“每日电讯报”3月30日发表的乔治·派特逊的文章鼓励西藏叛乱分子为“摆脱中国”而“继续战斗直到他们的目的达到为止”。这家报纸4月4日的社论献计说，西方应当在时机“成熟”时再来“攫取果实”。
    某些英国报纸阴险地挑拨中国人民和亚洲国家的关系。“每日邮报”诬蔑中国企图“从地图上抹掉西藏，为进一步向南扩张扫清道路”。“每日电讯报”诽谤中国对西藏的平叛“将使亚洲的中立主义者格外要考虑一下，中国尊重和平共处原则和万隆宣言有什么真正的价值”。
    一些英国报刊还公开煽动亚洲国家采取干涉中国内政和敌视中国的行动。“每日电讯报”说，在目前情况下，“应当由亚洲中立主义国家采取行动”，它主张由这些国家采取干涉中国内政的步骤，把西藏局势问题提交联合国。这家报纸认为必须抓住时机，“利用当前机会”来“破除”中国在亚洲的影响。“新闻纪事报”更无耻地鼓动印度出面干涉，它说，如果不这样做，印度的“国际地位”就会“大大降低”。
