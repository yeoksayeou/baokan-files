Fuzhou, this newspaper –– April 10th. Fujian Province's Fu'an, Nanping, Longxi and other special districts have been holding materials exchange meetings at the special district, county, people's commune, and production brigade levels. They have organized direct meetings between production, circulation, and consumption sectors, spot trading, and the signing of bilateral and multilateral production and sales contracts, further revitalizing the market and promoting industrial and agricultural production.

The characteristics of these materials exchange meetings held at each level in these special districts are short duration, small scale, rich content, and diverse forms. The materials exchange meetings within the commercial systems above the county level have further strengthened regional cooperation through the exchange of goods and extensive communication. The value of commodities traded during the internal materials exchange meeting of the Fu'an Special District's commercial system reached more than 750,000 yuan in just three days. The glass floats, essential materials temporarily unavailable for fishery production in Xiapu County, were obtained from the surplus materials of Luoyuan County at this exchange meeting. The commercial departments of Longxi Special District, in conjunction with the on-site production materials conference held in Pinghe County, organized internal exchanges and transferred 370,000 pieces of bamboo and wooden farm tools and a large amount of moso bamboo and timber from the mountainous counties to support coastal agriculture and fishery production, based on the actual needs of various regions; coastal counties also transferred 16,000 dan of shells and pumice stone, which are abundant locally, to supply mountainous commercial and agricultural departments for the production of indigenous fertilizer.

At a rural materials exchange conference held by Jian'ou County in the Satellite People's Commune in Nanya Town on March 28, various communes and production teams also signed production and sales contracts with commercial departments to better arrange the production of diversified economic activities while ensuring grain production. The contract signed by the Lukou Production Brigade with the County Commerce Bureau increased from the original 15 items to more than 30 items. Some industrial raw materials, export goods, and daily sundries, which were not produced before, have now been arranged for production.

The grassroots exchange meetings in various places generally take production brigades as the unit, select good material distribution points, and use evenings and lunch breaks, with the canteen serving as a market, to facilitate members' purchase and sale of goods, and to implement the policy of "spot goods, spot payment, who sells gets the money, equal value exchange, and pricing according to quality." Collective products belonging to the commune and teams are handled through consultation and discussion, combined with the implementation of the contract system, and then organized for collective delivery, with payment upon arrival. For individual sideline products, the policy of receiving, accepting, and paying upon arrival is adopted. At the exchange meeting held in the Satellite Commune of Nanya Town, Jian'ou, the total value of goods traded in two days reached more than 10,000 yuan. Through the exchange meeting, many commodities and industrial raw materials that were difficult to purchase in the past also appeared at this exchange meeting. Among them, tung seeds, umbrella heads, palm slices, sweet potato seedlings, etc., are all materials urgently needed in the current market. In just two days, the state purchased a large quantity of dried bamboo shoots, spring bamboo shoots, mushrooms, miscellaneous bamboo, wild fiber, tung seeds, native paper, hides, Chinese medicinal materials and other agricultural and sideline products here, further enriching the source of goods and further supporting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 10th. Commercial departments at all levels in Henan Province are regulating the surplus and deficiency of materials through materials exchange meetings, making the market more active.

Since March, the materials exchange meetings held by commercial departments at the county, city, and special district levels in Henan Province have been successively concluded. The provincial commercial department's provincial materials exchange meeting began on April 10.

Through the exchange of goods, careful accounting, investigation of surpluses and deficiencies, and regulation of availability at the materials exchange meetings in various places, the phenomenon of accumulation here and shortages there due to the unbalanced distribution of commodities has been basically overcome. For example, various wholesale stations in Tangyin County took the initiative to transfer 400,000 yuan worth of accumulated commodities to other counties, including 90 bicycles transferred to Anyang City alone. The Chengguan District of this county lacked soap, while the Caiyuan Commercial Department had a surplus. The Xin'an Commercial Department transferred 800 plows that had been accumulated for more than two years to Shangdian at the exchange meeting, meeting Shangdian's needs.

Commercial departments immediately organized production of materials that could be produced locally upon discovering them at the exchange meetings. Some places in Baofeng County produce whetstones, but no one produced them locally. After the commercial department discovered this through the exchange meeting, they immediately sent people to organize the production of 30,000 pieces, of which 25,000 could be supplied to other places in addition to supplying the county.

Through the materials exchange meetings, various places have explored the potential of local materials, enriched the supply of goods, and the market has become more active. At the materials exchange meeting held in Xinxiang Special District, Anyang and Xinxiang cities alone took out 8.07 million yuan worth of industrial products to support the countryside, and various counties also took out 26 kinds of industrial raw materials such as local alkali, saltpeter, and brine to support urban industrial production. In mid-March, the Zhidian Management District of Shenqiu County held nine exchange meetings in separate areas, mobilized the masses to dig and find potential materials, and carried out large-scale purchases and sales, exceeding the first quarter's purchase and sales plans by 75% and 89%, respectively. Through materials exchanges, Lushan County not only mutually supported production materials between mountainous and plain areas, urban and rural areas, and promoted spring plowing production, but also proposed commodities worth 550,000 yuan to support other regions. According to the plan arranged by the Xinxiang Special District, Changyuan County needed to provide 40,000 safety helmets and 1,000 piglets. After exploration through the materials exchange meeting, it can now provide 100,000 safety helmets and 3,000 piglets to support other counties.

In the early stage of the materials exchange meetings, a small number of commercial staff had conservative ideas, only wanting goods from outside and unwilling to take goods out, or wanting more and taking out less. The materials exchange meetings organized everyone to discuss the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard" and improve everyone's understanding. For example, during the Xinxiang Special District's materials exchange meeting, three "seeking truth" sessions were organized. After criticizing conservative ideas, the meeting participants provided more materials to support other regions with a spirit of communist cooperation. Commercial personnel in Ji County originally only proposed a plan for goods wanted, but after discussion, they took out more than 2 million yuan worth of materials for exchange at the meeting. After discussion, commercial personnel in Hui County revised the materials exchange plan, providing a total value of 3.48 million yuan for exchange, an increase of one-fold compared to the original plan, while the goods-wanted plan was only 1.55 million yuan.

　　互通有无　活跃市场　促进生产
    福建河南召开物资交流会　许多呆滞物资找到了市场
    本报福州10日电　福建省福安、南平、龙溪等专区逐级召开专区、县、人民公社以及生产大队的物资交流会，组织生产、流通、消费三方面直接见面，现货交易，签订产销双边和多边合同，进一步繁荣了市场，促进了工农业生产。
    这几个专区逐级召开物资交流会的特点是，时间短、规模小、内容丰富、形式多样。县以上商业系统内部的物资交流会，经过互通有无，广泛交流，进一步加强了地区间的协作。福安专区商业系统内部的物资交流会，仅在三天时间内，成交的商品总值达七十五万多元。霞浦县渔业生产中一时买不到的必需物资、玻璃浮子，这次在交流会上从罗源县的多余物资中得到了满足。龙溪专区商业部门结合在平和县召开生产资料现场会议，组织内部交流，根据各地实际需要从山区县份调出了三十七万件竹、木农具和大量的毛竹、木材，支援沿海农业和渔业生产；沿海县份也调出当地盛产的一万六千担贝壳和浮水石，供应山区商业部门和农业部门制造土化肥的需要。
    建瓯县于3月28日在南雅镇卫星人民公社召开的一次农村物资交流大会上，各个公社和生产队还通过和商业部门签订产销合同，在保证粮食生产的前提下，更好地安排了多种经济的生产。鲁口生产大队与县商业局签订的合同，由原来的十五种增加到三十多种，某些工业原料，出口物资，以及日用杂品等，原来不生产的现在已都作了安排。
    各地基层交流会，一般都以生产大队为单位，选择好物资集散点，利用晚上和中午休息时间，以食堂当商场，便利社员购买和出售商品，并贯彻了“现货现款、谁卖归谁、等价交换、按质论价”的政策，作到属于社队的集体产品，采取协商拟议办法，结合贯彻合同制，然后组织集体售送，货到款清。属于个人的零星副业产品，则采取随到、随收、随付款。在建瓯南雅镇卫星公社召开的交流会上，两天中成交的商品总值共达一万多元。通过交流会，许多过去难以采购到的商品和工业原料，这次交流会中也出现了。其中如桐籽、雨伞头、棕片、番薯苗等，都是目前市场迫切需要的物资。仅仅两天的时间，国家在这里收购了大宗笋干、春笋、香菇、杂竹、野生纤维、桐籽、土纸、兽皮、中药材等农副产品，更加充实了商品货源，进一步支援了工农业生产大跃进。
    据新华社郑州10日电　河南省各级商业部门通过物资交流会调剂物资余缺，使市场更加活跃。
    从3月份以来，河南省县、市、专区商业部门逐级召开的物资交流会，已经陆续结束。省商业厅召开的全省物资交流会已在4月10日开始。
    各地的物资交流会经过摆货源，算细帐，查余缺，调剂了有无，基本上克服了因为商品摆布不平衡而产生的这里积压那里脱销的现象。如汤阴县各批发站主动把四十万元积压商品调给外县，其中仅调剂给安阳市的自行车就有九十辆。这个县城关区缺少肥皂，而菜园商业部门却有积余。辛安商业部门在交流会上把积压两年多的八百个犁铧调剂给尚店，满足了尚店的需要。
    商业部门在交流会上发现本地有条件生产的物资，便立即组织生产。宝丰县有些地方出磨刀石，可是当地没有人生产，商业部门通过交流会发现后，立即派人组织生产三万块，除了供应本县外，还可以支援外地二万五千块。
    通过物资交流会，各地发掘了当地的物资潜力，充实了货源，市场更加活跃了。在新乡专区召开的物资交流会上，仅安阳、新乡两市就拿出八百零七万元的工业品支援农村，各县也拿出土碱、皮硝、卤水等二十六种工业原料支援城市工业生产。沈丘县纸店管理区3月中旬分片举行九次交流会，发动群众大挖大找潜在物资，开展大购大销，使第一季度的收购和销售计划分别超额75％和89％完成。鲁山县通过物资交流，不仅山区和平原、城关和农村互相支援了生产资料，促进了春耕生产，而且提出总值五十五万元的商品支援其他地区。长垣县按照新乡专区安排的计划，需要提供安全帽四万个、仔猪一千头，经过物资交流会的发掘，现在可以提供安全帽十万个、仔猪三千头，支援外县。
    各地在物资交流会召开的初期，有少数商业工作人员存在着保守思想，只向外要货，而不愿往外拿，或者是要的多，拿出的少。物资交流会就组织大家讨论“全国一盘棋”思想，提高大家的认识。如新乡专区的物资交流会在进行期间，组织了三次务虚，参加会议的人在批判了保守思想以后，都以共产主义的协作精神，提供更多的物资支援别的地区。汲县商业人员原来只提要货计划，在讨论以后拿出了二百多万元的物资在会上交流。辉县商业人员在讨论以后，重新编制了物资交流计划，提供交流的物资总值达三百四十八万元，比原计划增加一倍，而要货计划只一百五十五万元。
