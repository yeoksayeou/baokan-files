We are teaching staff at Shanghai First Medical College.

In the past year, we have achieved considerable progress in education revolution, Western medicine practitioners learning from traditional Chinese medicine, improving the quality of medical care, and conducting scientific research.

Under the encouragement of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the political awareness of all teachers, students, and staff in our college has greatly improved. Thanks to the earnest implementation of the Party's education policy, health work policy, and traditional Chinese medicine policy, all aspects of our work have greatly developed. We have achieved considerable progress in education revolution, Western medicine practitioners learning from traditional Chinese medicine, improving the quality of medical care, and conducting scientific research.

In the past year, we adopted the method of going out of the campus, organizing all teachers and students to go to factories and rural areas, to participate in production labor, and, in conjunction with agricultural production, to participate in many large-scale mass campaigns to eliminate pests and diseases and promote hygiene. Together with local medical personnel, we conducted examinations on over one million people for schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, filariasis, and ascariasis, and treated over 300,000 people. We trained 20,000 health workers, nursery workers, and cooks for factories and people's communes, and improved the hygiene conditions of over 2,000 canteens and nurseries. In one district of the city, we also conducted a survey of labor protection and hygiene conditions in 432 factories together with local medical personnel, and completed health check-ups for over 230,000 people. In addition, we carried out work to eliminate benzene poisoning in 108 spray paint factories in the urban area. Through going out of the campus to participate in pest and disease elimination work, the labor perspective of teachers and students has been strengthened, and the view of serving production and the health of the working people has been clarified. Because theory is closely linked with practice, the teaching content has been naturally enriched and the quality of teaching has been improved.

Due to the active implementation of the Party's traditional Chinese medicine policy, a mass movement of Western medicine practitioners learning from traditional Chinese medicine has been launched throughout the college, with more than 3,000 teachers and students participating in the study, and 28 senior teachers studying traditional Chinese medicine full-time. Knowledge of acupuncture has been basically popularized in our college, and traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine have been widely used in various clinical departments. In the spirit of learning, applying, and researching simultaneously, affiliated hospitals have also summarized many traditional Chinese medicine treatment methods with high clinical efficacy, such as traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese herbal medicine treatment for cervicitis, acupuncture treatment for acute appendicitis, radiation reactions, urticaria, and resuscitation of neonatal asphyxia. Preliminary results have also been obtained in the research on the treatment of late-stage schistosomiasis with Veratrum. We have also started research on the physiological mechanisms of acupuncture and Qigong therapy, and the design and trial production of meridian detection instruments. Up to now, the entire college has collected more than 20,000 folk remedies and prescriptions, and 78 various copies.

In terms of scientific research and technological innovation, 1,762 projects have been completed in the past year, many of which, such as the one-step synthesis method of the pesticide Dipterex, the statistical analysis of over 60,000 tumor pathology specimens, and the rapid determination method of carbon monoxide in the air, have certain practical significance for industrial and agricultural production and clinical practice.

In addition, significant achievements have also been made in the patriotic health campaign.

The achievements mentioned above are mainly due to the strengthening of Party leadership, putting politics in command, widely mobilizing the masses, breaking superstitions, and constantly fighting against various bourgeois ideologies.

Take various active measures to ensure continued Great Leap Forward this year.

1959 is a year of decisive significance for fundamentally changing the face of our country after three years of hard work. We believe that on the basis of last year's vigorous education revolution, vigorous technological innovation movement, and the mass study of traditional Chinese medicine, in accordance with the national and Shanghai municipal medical teaching and health work planning requirements, under the leadership of the Party, we must make comprehensive arrangements for all tasks, continue to advance, and strive to achieve greater and more comprehensive leaps forward in 1959. To ensure the Great Leap Forward in 1959, we believe that the following measures must be taken:

(1) Resolutely implement the Party's education policy and consolidate the victory of the education revolution. On the basis of the victory of last year's education revolution, improving teaching quality should be the central task of our college this year. We plan to complete the revision of teaching plans and teaching outlines for various majors this year. According to the new plan, on the one hand, we will strengthen the systematic study of the theory of basic medical courses, and also pay attention to its connection and衔接 with clinical courses. On the other hand, in combination with labor training, we will continue to organize teachers and students to participate in industrial and agricultural production labor and local medical and health epidemic prevention work. In accordance with the spirit of teaching and reforming simultaneously, we will carefully revise textbooks and gradually enrich them with the content of traditional Chinese medicine and modern scientific achievements. In order to closely link theory with practice, this year we will pilot the practice of having fourth-year students in the medical and health departments attend classes in the hospital and participate in general practical clinical work. To improve the quality of teaching, we encourage veteran teachers to continue to transform themselves politically and continuously improve themselves academically. In addition, we must also organize comprehensive advanced studies for young teachers in service and vigorously cultivate graduate students.

(2) Continue to study traditional Chinese medicine. On the basis of last year's mass study movement, we believe that it is still necessary to organize some teachers and doctors to study full-time or part-time. We consistently require gradually mastering the basic theoretical knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine and the treatment methods for common diseases in various specialties. In teaching, on the one hand, we will offer traditional Chinese medicine courses for systematic teaching, and on the other hand, we can gradually add experiences and insights from studying traditional Chinese medicine into various Western medicine courses. In addition, in combination with labor training, according to clinical needs, we will open up nurseries in the suburbs to plant Chinese medicinal materials; continue to produce various pharmaceuticals in the attached pharmaceutical factory; and organize and focus on trial research on the collected prescriptions. In order to effectively implement the traditional Chinese medicine policy, in the process of learning, applying, and researching traditional Chinese medicine, we must also constantly build a conceptual foundation to clarify that the purpose of learning traditional Chinese medicine is to inherit and promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine.

(3) Vigorously carry out scientific research. According to the needs of the National Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the requirements for improving the level of medical science, Shanghai First Medical College will focus on research in traditional Chinese medicine, tumors, radiological medicine, schistosomiasis, occupational health and occupational diseases, and chest diseases in 1959. In the research of traditional Chinese medicine, we will first strengthen the close cooperation between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and jointly study the clinical efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine. We will conduct scientific analysis of effective solutions, and further study the mechanism of "why they are effective." We believe that clinical efficacy that cannot be explained by modern science should not be easily negated. Clinical experience that has preliminary efficacy but is not yet mature should not be prematurely concluded and affirmed. In the area of tumors, we will study the early diagnosis of certain cancers and the integrated treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. In the area of schistosomiasis, we will continue to conduct experimental and clinical research on Veratrum treatment, as well as research on snail eradication and personal protection methods in special sections. In the area of occupational health and occupational diseases, we will research the treatment of silicosis with traditional Chinese medicine, and the prevention and control measures for lead, benzene, and pesticide poisoning. In the area of chest diseases, we will research the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis with traditional Chinese medicine and the clinical application of artificial heart-lung machines. In addition, we will also conduct research on issues such as public health planning in people's communes. In short, in the area of medical science research, we will not only strive to extract treasures from the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine, but also pay attention to studying modern medicine and health sciences. We must not only attach importance to scientific research that serves production, but also not neglect research in cutting-edge science and basic theory.

(4) Continue to improve hospital work. The affiliated hospitals will, on the basis of summing up last year's experience, actively improve the medical system, continue to improve service attitudes, improve the ideological level and medical quality of medical staff, and ensure the completion of teaching tasks, starting from everything for the patient. In addition, we must continue to implement the policy of running hospitals diligently and thriftily, and improve the turnover and utilization rate of beds.

(5) Continue to organize all teachers, students, and staff to carry out a patriotic movement that combines regular and concentrated efforts to eliminate the "seven pests" and promote hygiene. We realize that the tasks before us are very glorious and very arduous. However, we believe that as long as we rely on the leadership of the Party, widely mobilize the masses, further improve the work of uniting traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, give full play to the active role of young and old teachers, establish the idea of "the whole country as one chess game," do a good job in internal and external cooperation, pay attention to in-depth excavation of the treasures of traditional Chinese medicine, and pay attention to summarizing the experience of Western medicine in preventing and treating diseases, we will be able to create greater achievements, harvest more and better fruitful results, and offer gifts to the 10th anniversary of the National Day!

    努力贯彻党的教育方针
    颜福庆　沈克非  王淑贞  代表胡懋廉委员的联合发言
    我们是上海第一医学院教学工作者。
    一年来，在教育革命、西医学习中医、提高医疗质量和开展科学研究，取得不少成绩
    我院在总路线和工农业生产大跃进形势的鼓舞下，全体师生员工的政治觉悟大大提高了。由于认真贯彻了党的教育方针、卫生工作方针和中医政策，各项工作有了很大的发展，无论在教育革命、西医学习中医、提高医疗质量和开展科学研究方面，都取得了不少成绩。
    一年来，我们采取了走出校门的办法，组织了全体师生到工厂和农村，到生产劳动中去，结合农业生产参加了多次大规模的群众性的除害灭病讲卫生的工作，我们曾与地方医务人员一起，进行了血吸虫病、钩虫病、丝虫病和蛔虫病的一百余万人次的检查和三十余万人次的治疗工作，为工厂和人民公社训练了二万个保健员、保育员和炊事员；并改进了二千多个食堂和托儿所的卫生情况。在市的一个区内，也与当地医务人员一起进行了四百三十二个工厂的劳动保护和卫生情况调查，完成了二十三万多人的健康检查。此外，还在市区一百零八个喷漆工厂内进行了消灭苯中毒的工作。通过走出校门参加除害灭病的工作，师生的劳动观点加强了，为谁服务——为生产、为劳动人民健康服务的观点也明确了。由于理论密切联系了实际，很自然地丰富了教学内容，提高了教学质量。
    由于积极贯彻了党的中医政策，全院掀起了一个群众性的西医学习中医的运动，有三千多师生参加学习，并有高年教师二十八人脱产学习中医；针灸知识已在我院基本普及，中医中药已在临床各科普遍应用。本着边学边用边研究的精神，各附属医院也总结出许多临床疗效高的中医治疗方法，如中医中药治疗子宫颈炎、针灸治疗急性阑尾炎、放射反应、荨麻疹和抢救新生儿窒息等。在藜芦治疗晚期血吸虫病的研究方面，也得出了一个初步结果。我们还开始了针灸和气功疗法的生理机制的研究、经络探测仪器的设计和试制。到目前为止，全院已采集民间单方秘方二万余张、各种抄本七十八本。
    在科学研究技术革新方面，一年来完成了一千七百六十二个项目，其中许多项目如农药敌百虫一步合成法、肿瘤病理标本六万余件的统计分析、空气中一氧化炭快速测定法等，对工农业生产和临床实践均有一定的实际意义。
    此外，爱国卫生运动也获得了显著的成就。
    上述成绩的取得，主要是由于加强了党的领导，政治挂了帅，广泛发动了群众，破除迷信，不断与各种资产阶级思想进行斗争的结果。
    采取各项积极措施，保证今年继续大跃进
    一九五九年是我们苦战三年对基本改变面貌有决定意义的一年。我们认为在去年大闹教育革命、大搞技术革新运动、开展群众学习中医的基础上，根据全国和上海市的医学教学和卫生工作规划要求，在党的领导下，必须做好各项工作的全面安排，继续前进，以求在一九五九年内争取得更大的更全面的跃进。为了保证一九五九年的大跃进，我们认为必须采取下面几个措施：
    （一）坚决贯彻党的教育方针，巩固教育革命的胜利。在去年教育革命的胜利基础上，今年应以提高教学质量为我院的中心任务。我们准备在今年完成各种专业的教学计划和教学大纲的修订工作；并根据新的计划，一方面加强医学基础课理论的系统学习，同时也注意到它与临床课程的联系和衔接，另一方面结合劳动锻炼，继续组织师生参加工农业生产劳动和地方医疗卫生防疫工作；根据边教边改的精神，认真修订教材，逐步充实以祖国医学和现代科学成就的内容；为了做好理论密切联系实际，我们今年试行医疗、卫生系四年级学生在医院内上课并参加一般的实际临床工作；为提高教学质量，我们鼓励老教师在政治上继续自我改造，在学业上不断提高自己，此外还要组织在职青年教师的全面进修和大力培养研究生。
    （二）继续学习中医。在去年群众性学习运动的基础上，我们认为仍须组织部分教师和医师完全脱产或半脱产学习。一致要求逐步掌握中医的基础理论知识和各专科常见疾病的治疗方法。在教学中，一方面开设中医课进行系统教学，另一方面在各门西医课内可以逐步加入学习中医的心得和体会。此外，结合劳动锻炼，根据临床需要，在郊外开辟苗圃，种植中药材；在附设药厂内继续生产各种药剂；并对已收集的药方进行整理、重点加以试用研究。为了切实贯彻中医政策，我们在学、用和研究中医的过程中，还须不断务虚以奠定思想基础，明确学习中医的目的是为了要继承和发扬祖国医学遗产。
    （三）大力开展科学研究工作。我院根据全国工农业生产大跃进的需要以及提高医学科学水平的要求，一九五九年将重点地进行中医中药、肿瘤、放射医学、血吸虫病、劳动卫生职业病和胸部疾病等方面的研究。在中医中药研究方面，首先加强中西医的密切合作，共同研究中医中药的临床疗效。对有疗效的方案，进行科学分析，并进一步研究其“为什么有疗效”的机制问题。我们认为，对暂时还不能用现代科学阐明机制的临床疗效，绝不应轻易加以否定；对虽有初步疗效，但不够成熟的临床经验，也不应过早地做出结论予以肯定。在肿瘤方面，研究某些癌肿的早期诊断和中西医综合疗法；在血吸虫病方面，继续进行藜芦治疗的实验和临床研究以及特殊地段的灭螺和个人防护方法的研究；在劳动卫生职业病方面，研究矽肺的中药治疗，铅、苯和农药中毒的防治措施；在胸病方面，研究肺结核的中医中药治疗和人工心肺机的临床应用等。此外，还将进行人民公社卫生规划等问题的研究。总之，在医学科学研究方面，我们不仅努力向中医宝库取宝，同时也不放松研究近代医药卫生科学；我们既要重视为生产服务的科学研究，同时也不忽略尖端科学和基础理论的研究。
    （四）继续改进医院工作。各附属医院将在总结去年经验的基础上，从一切为病人出发，积极改进医疗制度，继续改善服务态度，提高医务人员的思想水平和医疗质量，保证教学任务的完成。此外，还要继续贯彻勤俭办医院的方针，提高病床的周转和使用率。
    （五）继续组织全体师生员工开展经常和突击相结合的除七害、讲卫生的爱国运动。我们认识到摆在我们面前的任务是非常光荣的，同时也是非常艰巨的。但是，我们相信，只要依靠党的领导，广泛发动群众，进一步做好团结中西医工作，充分发挥青老教师的积极作用，树立“全国一盘棋”的思想，搞好院内外协作，既注意深入发掘祖国医学的宝藏，也注意总结西医防治疾病的经验，在去年跃进的基础上，鼓起更大干劲，摆好任务，不断地修订指标、改进措施，发扬坚忍不拔的革命毅力，掀起更高的跃进高潮。我们一定能够在一九五九年创造出更大的成绩，把更多更好的丰硕果实摘到手，向国庆十周年献礼！
