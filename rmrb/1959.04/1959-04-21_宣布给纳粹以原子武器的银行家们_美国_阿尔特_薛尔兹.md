    Bankers Who Announced Giving Atomic Weapons to the Nazis
    United States  Aert Scheltz
    The Nazi-led army of West Germany is continuing to receive hydrogen bombs. This is pushing World War III a step forward.

    This deadly action was taken on the recommendation of a committee made up of bankers, retired generals, and missile manufacturers. This committee was established by President Eisenhower, whose purpose was to advise the president on foreign military aid. He provided the expected advice. The plan to give missiles to Germany was announced the next day.

    Among the members of this White House committee is John McCloy, a Rockefeller consortium banker with significant investments in Germany, who profits handsomely from missiles. It also includes Admiral Arthur Radford, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who wanted to drop big bombs in 1954. This admiral is now a missile manufacturer. His committee is advising the president to target more weapons at socialist countries.

    These merchants of death say that this military aid program requires two billion dollars annually. They say that the sixteen billion dollars proposed by the president is not enough.

    This Wall Street group says that the European forces of NATO (commanded by Hitler's general Speidel) must be a "new huge investment." More "strategic and tactical" missiles and aircraft must be shipped overseas.

    Looking at the history of Eisenhower's advisors is enlightening.

    Draper
    Chairman Major General William Draper has done many things to help Hitler in the past. Draper was a senior officer at Dillon, Read & Co. bank for many years. His bank issued hundreds of millions of dollars in securities to raise funds to finance Hitler's German industrialists. Draper handled a large part of the work of raising funds to finance Hitler.

    Draper also helped the Nazis in 1945. At that time, he was the Director of the Economic Department of the U.S. Control Council in Germany. He used his position to help Nazi industrialists make a comeback.

    This leader of Eisenhower's committee is now the chairman of the Mexican Light and Power Company in Mexico City. He is very close to former Dillon, Read & Co. head, Undersecretary of State Dillon, whose title today is Ike's special advisor on foreign aid.

    McCloy
    Rockefeller consortium banker John McCloy also helped the Nazis make a comeback. He did so as the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany during the Truman administration. McCloy has deep ties to the missile and nuclear bomb business. He is the chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, which has seven billion dollars in capital and provides funding to many missile companies. McCloy is also the main representative of Rockefeller on the board of directors of American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T). This company, with billions of dollars in capital, manufactured the first atomic bombs. This was done at AT&T's subsidiaries, Western Electric and Bell Labs. AT&T today is signing huge missile and nuclear contracts for the Department of Defense. McCloy is also a director of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which has signed several million-dollar missile contracts.

    Radford
    Admiral Arthur Radford is a director of Flight Refueling, Inc., a two-hundred-million-dollar company that has signed some large missile contracts.

    Radford is also a director of the Molybdenum Corporation of America. This admiral almost plunged the United States into World War III in 1954. When the French were defeated in Indochina, he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He then asked the president to let him drop big bombs on the Vietnamese patriots. It is said that he also wanted to drop big bombs on China.

    McNarney
    Another member of the committee, Joseph McNarney, is the vice president of General Dynamics, which is manufacturing the Atlas missile. The Atlas missile is a huge intercontinental ballistic missile that is said to be able to fly six thousand miles when completed.

    McNarney's company is a profiteer in the war of aggression. It did more than one billion dollars in business with the Department of Defense last year. It recently signed a contract to design a new atomic bomber. McNarney is responsible for the company's missile and bomber division.

    Dodge
    Another White House advisor, Joseph Dodge, is a director of Chrysler Corporation, which manufactures the Jupiter missile. This missile is said to be able to fly three thousand miles when completed.

    Dodge is an important figure in the financial world. He is the chairman of the Detroit Bank and Trust Company and the former director of the U.S. Budget. He is also a close friend of former Chrysler director and Secretary of Defense McElroy.

    Webb
    Another former budget director, James Webb, is also a person who profits from missiles. He is a member of the board of directors of McDonnell Aircraft Corporation in St. Louis, which has huge missile orders. He is close to Lawrence Rockefeller, brother of Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who gave McDonnell Corporation its first huge financial support.

    Anderson
    The wealthy committee member Dillon Anderson from Houston, Texas, is a director of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which derives its net income from missile and atomic contracts.

    Anderson is an influential figure in Washington and Texas. In the capital, he was Eisenhower's Special Assistant for National Security Affairs in 1955 and 1956. In Texas, he is a lawyer at Houston's largest law firm and a director of the National Bank of Commerce of Texas, which is rich in oil.

    McGee
    Oil tycoon George McGee is particularly interested in helping reactionary governments overseas. He was one of the Texas oilmen who obtained huge drilling rights in Franco's Spain a few years ago. I discovered this during an on-the-spot investigation in Texas. McGee is the general manager of Dallas McGee (Oil) Production Company, former ambassador to Turkey, and former Assistant Secretary of State.

    Gruenther
    General Alfred Gruenther, president of the American Red Cross, has entered the upper echelons of the financial world. He is the former Supreme Commander of NATO.

    Levy
    The last military aid advisor, Mark Levy, is a wealthy Washington lawyer and former Assistant Secretary of Defense.

    This is an advisory body whose personnel have been deliberately selected. It cannot pretend to be impartial. Its members have their own financial plans. As their pockets get bigger and bigger, they are playing with the lives of the American people—and millions of people abroad.

    The "military aid" program they support is not aid to democracy overseas. This program means providing De Gaulle with missiles and planes to use against Algerian patriots.

    This program means providing Pakistani generals with weapons to use against India—as Nehru has said.

    This program means providing more weapons to the fascist butcher Franco.

    This program means providing missiles and hydrogen bomb warheads to the Nazi generals of West Germany who may launch another world war.

### 宣布给纳粹以原子武器的银行家们  美国  阿尔特·薛尔兹

专栏：外论摘要

    宣布给纳粹以原子武器的银行家们
    美国  阿尔特·薛尔兹
    西德纳粹领导的军队正在继续得到氢弹。这样就把第三次世界大战向前推了一步。
    这种致命的行动是根据一个由银行家、退休的将军和导弹制造商组成的委员会的建议采取的。这个委员会是由艾森豪威尔总统建立的，他的目的是在对外军事援助方面向总统提供意见。他提供了意料中的意见。给德国导弹的计划第二天就宣布了。
    这个白宫委员会的成员中有在德国有很大投资的约翰·麦克洛伊，他是洛克菲勒财团银行家，是从导弹中获得巨额利润的人。它还包括了曾经在1954年希望丢大炸弹的前参谋长联席会议主席阿瑟·雷德福海军上将。这位海军上将今天是导弹制造商。他的委员会正在劝总统把更多的武器向社会主义国家瞄准。
    这些制造死亡的商人说，这个军事援助计划每年需要二十亿美元。他们说，总统所提出的十六亿美元是不够的。
    这个华尔街的集团说，（由希特勒的将领斯派达尔所指挥的）北大西洋公约组织的欧洲部队必须是“新的巨大的投资”。必须向海外运送更多的“战略和战术”导弹和飞机。
    看一下艾森豪威尔的顾问的历史是能发人深省的。
    德莱柏
    主席威廉·德莱柏少将过去曾作过许多事情来帮助希特勒。德莱柏有许多年是狄龙—里德公司银行的一个高级职员。他的银行曾为筹款资助希特勒的德国工业家发行了成亿美元的证券。筹款资助希特勒的工作有很大一部分是由德莱柏经手的。
    德莱柏在1945年又帮助了纳粹。那时他是美国在德国的管制委员会的经济部主任。他利用他的地位帮助纳粹工业家卷土重来。
    艾森豪威尔的这个委员会的领袖现在是墨西哥城的墨西哥电灯电力公司的董事长。他同前狄龙—里德公司的首脑、副国务卿狄龙是十分接近的，他今天的头衔是艾克对外援助的特别顾问。
    麦克洛伊
    洛克菲勒财团银行家约翰·麦克洛伊也曾经帮助纳粹卷土重来。他是在杜鲁门政府期间以美国驻德国的高级专员身份这样做的。麦克洛伊同导弹和核弹业务关系很深。他是向许多导弹公司提供经费的拥有七十亿美元资本的曼哈顿大通银行的董事长。麦克洛伊也是洛克菲勒在美国电讯公司董事会中的主要代表。这个资本达几十亿美元的公司制造了第一批原子弹。这是在美国电讯公司的支公司——西方电气公司和贝尔实验室做的。美国电讯公司今天正在为国防部签订巨大的导弹和核合同。麦克洛伊也是签订了好几百万美元的导弹合同的威斯汀豪斯电气公司的董事。
    雷德福
    阿瑟·雷德福海军上将是飞歌公司的董事，这是一个签订了一些大的导弹合同的二亿美元的公司。
    雷德福也是美国钼矿公司的董事之一。这位海军上将在1954年几乎把美国投入了第三次世界大战。当法国人在印度支那打败仗的时候，他是参谋长联席会议主席。他那时要求总统让他向越南爱国者投大炸弹。据说，还要向中国投大炸弹。
    麦克纳尼
    委员会的另一个委员约瑟夫·麦克纳尼是正在制造阿特拉斯导弹的通用动力公司的副总经理。阿特拉斯导弹是巨大的洲际弹道导弹，据说这种导弹在制成以后可以飞六千英里。
    麦克纳尼的公司是一个侵略战争中的获利者。它在去年同国防部做了十多亿美元的生意。它不久前签订了一个设计新的原子轰炸机的合同。麦克纳尼是负责这个公司的导弹和大轰炸机部的。
    道奇
    白宫的另一个顾问约瑟夫·道奇是制造丘辟特导弹的克莱斯勒公司的董事。据说这种导弹在制成以后可以飞三千英里。            
    道奇是一个重要的金融界人物。他是底特律银行和信托公司的董事长和美国预算的前指导人。他也是前克莱斯勒公司的董事国防部长麦克耳罗伊的亲密朋友。
    韦伯
    另一个前预算指导人詹姆斯·韦伯也是一个靠导弹获利的人。他是有巨额导弹订货的圣路易的麦克唐奈尔飞机公司董事会的董事。他同纳尔逊·洛克菲勒州长的兄弟劳伦斯·洛克菲勒接近，后者曾给麦克唐奈尔公司第一笔巨大的财政上的支援。
    安德逊
    来自得克萨斯州豪斯顿的富有的委员狄龙·安德逊是威斯汀豪斯电气公司的董事，这个公司是从导弹和原子合同中得到它的纯收入的。
    安德逊是华盛顿和得克萨斯州的一个有影响的人物。在首都，他在1955年和1956年是艾森豪威尔的国内安全事务的特别助理。在得克萨斯州，他是豪斯顿最大的法律事务所的律师和盛产石油的得克萨斯州的国民银行的董事。
    麦吉
    石油大王乔治·麦吉对帮助海外的反动政府特别有兴趣。他是几年前在佛朗哥西班牙取得巨大的钻探权的得克萨斯州的石油商之一。我是在得克萨斯州进行实地调查时  发现这一点的。麦吉是达拉斯麦吉（石油）生产公司的总经理、前驻土耳其大使和  前助理国务卿。
    格仑瑟
    美国红十会会长艾尔弗雷德·格仑瑟将军进入了金融界的最上层。他是前北大西洋公约组织的最高司令。
    李瓦
    最后一个军事援助顾问马克·李瓦是一个富裕的华盛顿律师，他是前助理国防部长。
    这就是一个人员经过有意物色的顾问机构。它不能假装是公正的。它的成员有他们自己财政上的打算。在他们的腰包愈来愈大的同时，他们正在玩弄美国人民——和国外千百万人——的生命。
    他们所支持的“军事援助”计划并不是对海外民主政治的援助。这个计划意味着向戴高乐提供用来反对阿尔及利亚爱国者的导弹和飞机。
    这个计划意味着向巴基斯坦将军提供用来反对印度的武器——尼赫鲁就是这样说的。
    这个计划意味着向法西斯屠夫佛朗哥提供更多的武器。
    这个计划意味着向可能发动另一次世界大战的西德的纳粹将军提供导弹和氢弹弹头。
