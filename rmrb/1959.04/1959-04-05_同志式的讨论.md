Comradely Discussion

After reading the open letter by Comrades Yuan Wenshu and Chen Huangmei, published on page seven of the March 4th issue of the People's Daily, discussing issues regarding films from 1957, I felt very close to it. I read it repeatedly, and I feel it is a good article of literary criticism. The article demonstrates humility, objectivity, and respect for others, as well as a realistic and fact-based approach to analyzing and discussing issues. In the article, Comrade Yuan Wenshu first affirmed the correct and guiding aspects of Comrade Chen Huangmei's article commenting on some films from 1957. Then, he raised some of his own differing opinions with many concrete facts and a consultative tone. The article contains analysis and reasoning, without a hint of dogmatism or simple accusation. I believe that as long as it concerns contradictions among the people, we should adopt this kind of well-intentioned attitude in discussing problems. This should also be a manifestation of the noble style in our era's literary criticism.

    同志式的讨论
    读了3月4日人民日报七版刊载的袁文殊和陈荒煤两同志讨论1957年影片问题的公开信，感到十分亲切。我反复地读了几遍，觉得这是文艺批评中的好文章。文章中表现出了谦虚、客观和尊重别人的态度，以及分析、讨论问题时实事求是的精神。袁文殊同志在文章中首先肯定了陈荒煤同志评论1957年一些影片的文章中正确的、有指导意义的地方，继之，又用许多具体事实和商量的口吻提出了自己的一些不同看法。文章有分析、说理，丝毫没有武断和简单指责的味道。我认为只要是属于人民内部矛盾，都应该采取这种善意的讨论问题的态度。这也应该是我们时代文艺批评中崇高风格的表现。
