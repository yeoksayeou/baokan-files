Comrade Lu Han said: The Tibetan rebels' betrayal of the motherland is self-destruction. In fact, it lifted the big stone slab that was pressing on the heads of the Tibetan people. From then on, the Tibetan people will embark on a prosperous and happy socialist road.

Chairman, fellow members:

I have heard Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the reports of the leaders, and I fully agree with and enthusiastically support them.

Thanks to the wise and correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the beloved Chairman Mao, and the support and efforts of the vast number of people across the country, China has undergone fundamental changes in just over four years. Unprecedented achievements have been made in all aspects, shaking off the backward state of low production and poor living conditions in old China, like a sun with boundless radiance appearing in the world. Our international status and prestige have been raised to an unprecedented level; socialist construction at home is advancing at a rapid pace; and the material and cultural living standards of the people have been greatly improved and raised. Who gave us these great achievements? When drinking water, we should remember the source. This is what the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao gave us. All facts prove that only by following the socialist road under the leadership of the Party can such a large-scale undertaking be completed at such a fast speed. Here, we sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party! Thank Chairman Mao! We must be even more convinced of the correctness and superiority of socialism.

**After Liberation, Ethnic Minorities Experienced a Great Political and Economic Upsurge**

I am a Yi from Yunnan. Before liberation, our ethnic minorities were oppressed and exploited by the reactionary regime, and suffered extremely painful ethnic discrimination and persecution. They lived on the verge of national extinction: the vast majority lived in barren areas, and society was stagnated in the stages of slave society, serf society, and even primitive clan society. Low production led to poverty; lack of medicine led to disease and death; and lack of education made the people ignorant. They were also exploited and oppressed by the ruling class of the ethnic groups, which is an obvious fact. After the Chinese Communist Party liberated the people of the whole country, under the wise and correct ethnic policy of the Party, all ethnic groups were greatly emancipated, and everyone united in the big family of the motherland. Over the past ten years, all ethnic groups have gained full autonomy in politics and have become masters of their own affairs. We only need to see that many ethnic minority areas across the country have achieved regional autonomy and have formulated their own specific regulations. Recently, the State Council meeting also approved the organizational regulations of the people's congresses and people's committees at all levels in the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, and the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province. This shows that we have legally defined autonomous rights. The imperialists, reactionaries, and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs slander the Party for "assimilating" and "ruling" ethnic minorities, and "not granting ethnic regional autonomy," which are completely malicious attempts to provoke ethnic sentiments and undermine ethnic unity.

After liberation, all ethnic minorities have also achieved great economic development, which are all living facts. The Party's policy is to enable all ethnic minorities to get rid of ethnic discrimination and class oppression within the ethnic groups; to get rid of the backward state of poverty, ignorance, and weakness; to adopt different degrees, sequences, and peaceful methods, and to jointly transition to a superior socialist society and live a happy and prosperous life in a large family. We only need to look at the ethnic minority areas that have undergone democratic reforms. With the arrival of the comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction across the country, the vast number of ethnic minority people, full of spirit and energy, have launched a high tide of great leaps in industrial and agricultural production. In 1958, the grain output of various autonomous regions increased by nearly 100% compared with 1957. Generally, they have achieved self-sufficiency in grain, with an average of about 1,000 jin per person, and some places are even higher. The agricultural and sideline output value of ethnic minority areas increased by 209% in 1956 compared with before liberation, and in 1958 it generally increased by more than double compared with 1956. Ethnic minority areas originally had no industry to speak of, not even simple handicrafts. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, ethnic minority industries have developed rapidly and sprung up everywhere. Due to the prosperity of production, it has also promoted the great development of transportation, education, culture, and medical and health undertakings. Facts have proved that only by accepting the leadership of the Party and following the socialist road can ethnic minorities have a way out and have a happy and fulfilling life. Therefore, the general line of socialism is suitable for the conditions of all ethnic regions. On the basis of the comprehensive leap forward in socialism and the continuous improvement of the political consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups, a high tide of establishing people's communes has emerged among all ethnic groups. Within three months, with the exception of Tibet and some individual regions, people's communes have been realized. This is a great event of historical significance, which has accelerated the socialist construction of ethnic minority areas and strengthened the unity and cooperation between all ethnic groups, and has prepared good conditions for all ethnic groups to transition to communism in the future.

At the same time, in ethnic minority areas, with the exception of a very few places, democratic reforms have been completed and socialist transformation has been basically completed. These revolutionary movements are necessary, because some ethnic upper-class elements (slave owners, landlords, monks), for the sake of their own class interests, do not hesitate to kill each other, brutally oppress and exploit the people of their own ethnic groups, and take a confrontational attitude towards the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, refuse to take the socialist road, greatly hindering the forward development of all ethnic groups and endangering the interests of the vast number of working people of all ethnic groups. We all know that the policy of peaceful transformation, for the upper-class elements of ethnic minorities, sacrifices only a little of their own ruling and exploitation rights, while what they gain is vast, endless, and beneficial to future generations. Some upper-class elements of ethnic minorities are unaware of this, stubbornly conservative, violate the laws of social development, and hinder historical progress, and that is only a way to self-destruction.

**After the Democratic Reform in Yunnan's Ethnic Minority Areas, Ethnic Relations are More Harmonious and People's Lives are More Pleasant**

Facts have proved that after the democratic reforms and communization in our ethnic minority autonomous regions in Yunnan, the backwardness and poverty have been changed, and ethnic relations have become more harmonious, united, and cooperative. This is greatly conducive to the development of production. At the same time, there is also greater unity within the ethnic groups, and long-standing feuds have been eliminated. The agricultural cooperatives have been further transformed from solely engaging in agricultural production to people's communes that integrate industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The women's labor force has been liberated, and public canteens have been basically realized. For example, the Yi women have a good reflection, saying: "Saving grain, saving vegetables, saving labor; eating enough, eating well, eating economically and hygienically; going to work early, returning late, women no longer revolve around the stove." The communes have also established welfare undertakings such as hospitals, nurseries, and clubs, which have improved labor productivity.

Yi commune members praised the people's commune, saying:

"The cruelty of slave society, thousands of complaints can't be exhausted;
The benefits of the people's commune, thousands of words can't be finished;
The kindness of the Communist Party, thousands of generations can't forget;
Chairman Mao is like the sun, shining for thousands of years."

Now, the Yi Autonomous Region has continued to leap forward from slave society to socialist society. Ethnic relations are more friendly and united, and people's lives are more stable and happy. For example, the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, where 800,000 ethnic minorities live, after realizing the people's commune, unified and adjusted the fields according to the characteristics of each ethnic group, the water conservancy irrigation, and the distance of the land, solving the problem of interspersed fields that have always caused great disputes and even deaths, strengthening ethnic unity and promoting production. In Jianchuan County alone, with a population of more than 240,000, there are six ethnic groups: Bai, Han, Yi, Hui, Dai, and Tibetan. In the past, when there were more than 140 agricultural cooperatives, disputes arose between cooperatives and between ethnic groups due to the small scale of interspersed land. After the establishment of the commune, all more than 1,700 mu of scattered and staggered fields were adjusted into six large pieces, and irrigation was carried out in order, and there were never any disputes, and the unit area yield was greatly increased. The members of several ethnic cooperatives, in order to commemorate the close friendship established in labor, renamed a Longwangjian to "Unity Ditch," and established a common paradise through this ditch water.

For example, many ethnic minorities, because of backward social life, insufficient education, and low ideological awareness, have always had various superstitious ideas. After several years of the Party's strong leadership, the popularization of education, the people's understanding has been greatly improved, and they have been able to engage in production labor practically and earnestly, and are no longer superstitious about ghosts and gods. For example, the Hani ethnic group has a folk song that says:

"Cut down the Longbamen,
The Aini do not believe in gods.
The mountainous area becomes a paradise,
The production is leaping forward."

The Naxi ethnic group also has a song that says:

"Why bother to invite many
Bara to chant scriptures,
And use so much food to sacrifice to the Five Grains God?
If you wish the crops to be good in your heart,
Just work hard,
And the soil will turn into gold."

In the past few years, production has greatly leaped forward. With the improvement of mass awareness and the development of medical and health work, the superstitious activities of slaughtering animals and worshiping ghosts in the ethnic minorities of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province have been reduced. The mountain officials, village leaders, witch doctors, and landlords and rich peasants, who are the maintainers of the old system, have become increasingly isolated among the masses, and they dare not organize large-scale activities of slaughtering animals and worshiping ghosts among the masses. These situations fully show how great an impact the leap forward in production and social progress have had on the ideological consciousness of ethnic minorities.

In short, all this shows that the Party's ethnic policy is great and correct. The leadership of the Party is the guarantee of all revolutionary and construction undertakings. Ethnic work is an important aspect of the proletarian revolution and the proletarian dictatorship, and it must be under the leadership of the Party to continue to move from victory to victory.

**The Tibetan Traitors Have Violated the Law of Historical Development**

This time, the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group violated the will of the 1.2 million Tibetan people and violated the law of historical development. They vainly attempted to maintain their reactionary rule and exploitation and maintain their vested interests. Therefore, they opposed the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist transformation. They launched an armed rebellion, undermining national unity and ethnic unity. They have been completely defeated. In fact, the vast majority of the people in Tibet need to be liberated from the cruel and dark serf system. Many patriotic and progressive people in the upper and middle strata of Tibet, with a clear understanding of righteousness, also advocate democratic and step-by-step reforms of the unreasonable social system. The Central People's Government, proceeding from the interests of ethnic unity and taking into account the special circumstances of Tibet, has always adopted a policy of slowing down the pace and waiting patiently for democratic reforms in Tibet. However, a small number of rebels abandoned themselves to depravity, betrayed the Tibetan people and the motherland, and moved towards self-destruction. In fact, they have lifted the big stone slab that was pressing on the heads of the Tibetan people, creating favorable conditions for democratic reforms in Tibet. We believe that from then on, the Tibetan people will get rid of the dark life of poverty and backwardness and embark on a prosperous and happy socialist road. As Premier Zhou said, "The Tibetan Plateau will be built into a veritable paradise on earth." I fully support all the measures taken by the Party and the government in the Tibet region this time. I hope that the Tibetan people will carry out necessary social reforms and live with our people of all ethnic groups in the happy family of the motherland. The development of the construction undertakings in the two Tibetan autonomous prefectures of Aba and Diqing is a good example for us. Representatives like Panchen Erdeni and Apao Awang Jinmei have loyally accepted the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, drawn a clear line between themselves and the rebels, sincerely and earnestly taken the socialist road, and safeguarded national unity and the interests of the Tibetan people. This is what I admire and am moved by. We are also very concerned about the Dalai Lama being kidnapped to India by the rebels. We hope that he can get rid of the coercion and return to the motherland as soon as possible. As for the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" on April 18, it is completely reversing right and wrong, distorting the facts, and is fabricated by the imperialists, Indian expansionists, and rebels under coercion. I think it is definitely not the Dalai Lama's original intention. I express my extreme anger. For those rebels, I still hope that they will wake up quickly and stop being used by others to undermine national unity. Returning to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible is a very wise approach. The Party is magnanimous and does not hold past mistakes against them.

I am an upper-class element of an ethnic minority and a member of a democratic party. I personally still have some backward ideological remnants and lifestyle habits. I want to repeatedly exercise in this great era of forging and accelerate self-transformation. I will loyally accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, do a good job in my post, and fight to the end for the cause of socialist construction.

Finally, I respectfully congratulate:

The Second National People's Congress and the Third National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference a complete success! And I wish all the representatives and members progress and health!

I shout:

Long live the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao!
Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups!

### 我国少数民族意气风发

专栏：

    我国少数民族意气风发
    卢汉委员说：西藏叛乱分子背叛祖国是自取灭亡，实际上掀开了压在西藏人民头上的大石板，从此，西藏人民将走上繁荣幸福的社会主义道路主席团，各位委员：
    我听到了周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和各位首长的报告，我完全同意并热烈拥护。
    由于伟大的中国共产党和敬爱的毛主席英明正确的领导，全国广大人民的支持和努力，使我国在短短的四年多的时间，起了根本性的变化。任何一方面都获得史无前例的成就，摆脱了旧中国生产低劣，生活贫困的落后状况，有如光芒万丈的太阳出现于世界。我们的国际地位和威信已空前提高；在国内社会主义建设事业，正以飞跃的速度向前迈进；人民的物质和文化生活水平得到更大的改善与提高。这些伟大的成就是谁给我们的呢？饮水思源，这是中国共产党和毛主席给我们的。一切事实证明：只有在党的领导下走社会主义道路，才会以这么快的速度完成那么规模宏大的事业。在这里，我们衷心的感谢中国共产党！感谢毛主席！要更加信服社会主义的正确性和优越性。
    解放后少数民族政治经济大翻身
    我是云南的彝族。我们少数民族在解放以前，受到反动政权的压迫剥削，受到极为痛苦的民族歧视和迫害。一直生活在民族即将绝灭的死亡线上：绝大多数生活在贫瘠的地区，社会停顿在奴隶社会、农奴社会，甚至是原始氏族社会的阶段上。生产低劣，造成贫困；医药缺乏，造成病疫和死亡；没有教育，人民愚昧无知。也受到民族上层统治阶级的剥削与压迫，这是显而易见的事实。到了中国共产党解放了全国人民，在党的英明正确的民族政策之下，各族人民大大的翻身了，大家都在祖国的大家庭里团结起来了。十年来，各族人民在政治上已经获得充分的自治权利，自己当家做主了。我们只要看，全国很多少数民族地区已实现了区域自治，制定了自己的单行法规。新近国务院会议还通过了我们云南省文山僮族、红河哈尼族彝族、楚雄彝族、怒江傈僳族等自治州各级人民代表大会和各级人民委员会的组织条例。这就说明我们有了法定的自治权利。帝国主义、反动派和蒋介石匪帮诬蔑党对少数民族是“同化”、“统治”，“不给予民族地方自治”等等，完全是恶意的挑拨民族感情和破坏民族团结的无耻谰言。
    解放后，各少数民族在经济上也获得巨大的发展，这都是活生生的事实。党的政策是要各少数民族都摆脱民族歧视和民族中的阶级压迫；摆脱贫、愚、弱的落后状态；采取不同程度的、先后的、和平的方式，共同过渡到优越的社会主义社会，过幸福康乐的大家庭生活。我们只要看看已经进行了民主改革的少数民族地区，随着全国社会主义建设全面大跃进形势的到来，广大少数民族人民，意气风发，干劲冲天，掀起了工农业生产大跃进的高潮，一九五八年，各族自治地方的粮食产量比一九五七年增加近一倍。一般都已经做到粮食自给，每人平均约有一千斤，有些地方还高些。少数民族地区的农副业产值，一九五六年就比解放前增加百分之二百零九，一九五八年又比一九五六年普遍增加一倍以上。少数民族地区原来没有什么工业可言，甚至连简单的手工业都没有。一九五八年大跃进以来，少数民族工业突飞猛进，遍地开花。由于生产的繁荣，也促进了交通、教育文化、医药卫生等事业的巨大发展。事实证明，只有接受党的领导，走社会主义的道路，才是少数民族的生路，才会有美满幸福的生活。所以，社会主义总路线是适合于各族地区情况的。在社会主义全面大跃进和各族人民政治觉悟不断提高的基础上，各族人民出现了建立人民公社运动的高潮，三个月的时间内，除西藏和某些个别地区外，都已经实现了人民公社化。这是一个具有历史意义的伟大事件，这就加速了各少数民族地区的社会主义建设和加强了各民族间的团结合作，并为各族人民将来过渡到共产主义准备良好的条件。
    同时，在少数民族地区，除很少一些地方外，都已经完成了民主改革和基本上完成了社会主义改造。这些革命运动是必要的，因为有些民族上层分子（农奴主、地主、僧侣），他们为了自己阶级的既得利益，不惜同类相残，血腥的压迫和剥削本民族的人民，和中国共产党的领导采取对抗的态度，拒绝走社会主义道路，大大的阻碍了各族人民的向前发展，危害各族广大劳动人民的利益。我们都知道，和平改造的方针对少数民族上层分子来说，牺牲的只是一点点自己的统治和剥削权利，而所获得的却是广大的、无穷无尽的、子孙万代的好处。有些少数民族上层分子觉悟不到这一点，顽固保守，违反了社会发展规律，阻碍了历史前进，那是只有自趋灭亡之一途。
    云南少数民族地区民主改革以后，民族关系更加融洽，人民生活更加愉快
    事实证明：我们云南少数民族自治地区经过民主改革和公社化以后，改变了贫困落后的面貌，民族关系更加融洽、团结与协作了。这就大大有利于生产的发展。同时，在民族内部也更加团结，由来已久的冤家械斗消灭了。进一步改变了农业社单一从事农业生产，使成为工、农、商、学、兵五位一体和农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展的人民公社。解放了妇女劳动力，基本上实现了公共食堂化。例如我们彝族妇女就反映良好，她们说：“省粮、省菜、省劳力；吃得饱，吃得好，吃得节约又卫生；早出工、晚收工，妇女不再围着锅台团团转。”公社还举办了医院、托儿所、俱乐部等福利事业，提高了劳动生产率。
    彝族社员歌颂人民公社说：
    “奴隶社会的残酷，千诉万诉诉不尽；
    人民公社的好处，千说万说说不完；
    共产党的恩情呀，千辈万辈忘不了；
    毛主席像太阳呀，千年万年放光芒。”
    现在，彝族自治区已经从奴隶社会向社会主义社会继续跃进了。民族关系更加友爱团结，人民生活更加安定愉快了。又如我们云南有八十万少数民族聚居的大理白族自治州，实现了人民公社化以后，根据了各民族的特点、水利灌溉和土地远近的情况，统一调整田地，解决了历来纠纷很大甚至打死人的插花田的问题，加强了民族团结，推动了生产。仅剑川县二十四万多人口中，有白、汉、彝、回、傣、藏等六个民族，过去有一百四十多个农业社时，因规模不大，对插花地引起了社与社之间和民族之间的纠纷。等到公社成立，把全部一千七百多亩零星交错的田地调整为六大片，顺序进行灌溉，从未发生争执，单位面积产量大大增加。几个民族社的社员们为了纪念在劳动中建立起来的亲密友谊，把一条龙王涧改名为“团结沟”，通过这条沟水建立了共同的乐园。
    又如很多少数民族，因为社会生活落后，教育不足，思想觉悟不高，一向有着各种各样的迷信观念。经过几年来党的坚强领导，普及了教育，人民的认识大都提高了，他们能够切实认真的从事生产劳动，不再迷信鬼神了。如像哈尼族有首民歌说：
    “砍倒龙巴门，
    僾伲不信神。
    山区变乐园，
    生产大跃进。”
    纳西族也有一首歌说：
    “何必去请多
    巴来念经，
    用那么多的食物祭五谷神？
    假如你心里愿望庄稼好，
    只要辛勤劳动，
    泥土就变成金。”
    这几年来，生产大大的跃进，随着群众觉悟的提高和医药卫生工作的开展，云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州的少数民族，杀牲祭鬼的迷信活动已经减少了，作为旧制度的维护者的山官，寨头，魔头以及地主富农等，在群众中已日愈孤立，他们已不敢在群众中组织大规模的杀牲祭鬼活动。这些情况，充分说明生产跃进与社会进步对少数民族的思想意识，已起了多么大的影响。
    总之，这一切都说明了党的民族政策是伟大和正确的。党的领导是一切革命事业和建设事业的保证。民族工作是无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的一个重要方面，也必须是在党的领导下，才能从胜利继续走向胜利。
    西藏叛国分子违反了历史发展的规律
    这一次西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，就是违反了一百二十万藏族人民的意志，违反了历史发展的规律，他们妄想维护其反动统治与剥削，保持他们的既得利益。因而反对中国共产党的领导和社会主义的改造。发动了武装叛乱，破坏国家统一和民族团结。他们已经遭到彻底的失败。事实上，在西藏的绝大多数人民，需要从残酷的黑暗的农奴制度下解放出来。西藏上层和中层的许多爱国进步人士，深明大义，也主张民主地有步骤地改革不合理的社会制度，中央人民政府从民族团结的利益出发，同时考虑到西藏地方的特殊情况，对于西藏的民主改革，一直采取放慢步骤和耐心等待的方针。但是少数叛乱分子，自甘暴弃，背叛西藏人民和祖国，自趋灭亡。实际上反而掀开了压在西藏人民头上的大石板，为西藏民主改革造成有利的条件。我们相信，从此，西藏人民将摆脱贫苦落后的黑暗生活，走上繁荣幸福的社会主义道路。正如周总理所说的“西藏高原将建成一个真正的人间乐园”。我完全拥护党和政府此次在西藏地区的一切措施。希望西藏人民进行必要的社会改革，和我们各族人民一道生活在幸福的祖国大家庭里。阿坝、迪庆两个藏族自治州建设事业的发展，就是我们很好的榜样，如像班禅额尔德尼代表和阿沛·阿旺晋美代表们，这样忠诚的接受中国共产党的领导，与叛乱分子划清敌我界限，真心实意的走社会主义的道路，维护祖国统一和藏族人民的利益，这是我非常敬佩和感动的。达赖喇嘛被叛乱分子劫持到印度去，我们也非常关怀，希望能早日摆脱挟持回到祖国来，至于四月十八日的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，那完全是颠倒是非，歪曲事实，是帝国主义、印度扩张主义分子和叛乱分子的挟持捏造搞出来的，我认为决不是达赖喇嘛的本意。我表示万分的愤怒。对于那些叛乱分子，我还是希望他们赶快觉悟，不要再被人利用，破坏国家统一。早日回到祖国怀抱，这才是非常明智的办法，党是宽大为怀不咎既往的。
    我是少数民族上层分子，又是民主党派的成员。我个人还存在着一些落后的思想残余和生活作风，我要在这伟大的时代洪炉里反复锻炼，加速自我改造。忠诚的接受中国共产党的领导，做好本岗位工作，为社会主义的建设事业奋斗到底。
    末了，敬祝：
    第二届全国人代大会和第三届全国政协大会圆满成功！并祝各位代表，各位委员的进步和健康！
    我高呼：
    中国共产党和毛主席万岁！
    各族人民大团结万岁！
