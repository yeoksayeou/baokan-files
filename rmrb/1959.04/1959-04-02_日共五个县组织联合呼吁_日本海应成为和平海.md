    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 31st: According to a report in today's "Akahata," the local organizations of the Japanese Communist Party in Niigata, Nagano, Toyama, Ishikawa, and Fukui prefectures jointly issued a "Call for a Movement for a Peace Declaration on the Sea of Japan" a few days ago. The call appealed to peace and democratic groups and people from all walks of life in the five prefectures to launch a movement demanding that the Japanese government and the prefectural governments of the five prefectures declare the Sea of Japan a "Sea of Peace." The call pointed out that socialist construction in the Soviet Union, China, and Korea, across the Sea of Japan, is leaping forward. If Japan restores normal diplomatic relations and establishes peaceful and friendly relations with these countries, trade, economic, and cultural exchanges between the coastal prefectures of the Sea of Japan and the countries on the opposite shore will develop rapidly.

    新华社31日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党新潟、长野、富山、石川、福井五个县的地方组织前几天联合发表一项“关于日本海和平宣言运动的呼吁书”，号召五个县的和平、民主团体和各阶层人民展开运动，要求日本政府和五个县的县政府宣布日本海为“和平海”。呼吁书指出，在日本海对面的苏联、中国、朝鲜的社会主义建设正在大跃进，如果日本同这些国家都恢复正常邦交和建立和平友好关系，日本海沿岸的各县同对岸国家的贸易、经济和文化交流将会飞速发展。
