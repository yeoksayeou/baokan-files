    The Road
    Bai Nationality, Zhang Chang
    This is an ancient primeval forest. Vines and creepers are like giant pythons; you can't see the sky when you look up, and you can't see the ground when you look down. The sky and the ground are both covered by thick leaves. You can't see the sun in this forest; even in broad daylight, the eyes of owls are blinking.

    In the forest, there is a wide road that disappears deep into the forest. It wasn't made by people. When I was little, my grandfather said it was trampled out by wild elephants and rhinoceroses.

    When I was little, seeing my old grandfather driving his old ox, tilling the thin land, I thought, when will I find a way to lasso an elephant or a rhinoceros, and let them help my poor grandfather plow the fields...

    I thought, when will I be able to help my grandfather herd them, playing a bamboo flute, riding on their backs, going deep into the forest—along this wide, long road...

    My grandfather worked himself to death on this land, and in the end, he didn't see the elephant or rhinoceros I brought out of the forest.

    And me—

    Comrade, first take a look at the road that the old grandfather talked about. It has become twice as wide! Twice as straight! Ah, look again at the footprints of the monsters on this road surface. Guess, is it an elephant or a rhinoceros?!

    Aha! Let me tell you: this is a "caterpillar tractor"—the big iron rhinoceros that Chairman Mao gave us! It has just passed by. Do you want to see it? Good, let's go!

    Following the road from my grandfather's time, our farm is on the other side of the forest.

    路
    白族　张长
    这是一片古老的原始森林。藤葛像大蟒，抬头看不见天，低头看不见地。天和地都被厚厚的叶子遮住了。这片森林里看不到太阳，大白天还忽闪着猫头鹰的眼睛。
    森林里有一条宽宽的路，一直隐没在森林深处——可不是人挖的，小时，爷爷说，那是野象和犀牛踩出来的。
    小时，看见老的爷爷架着老的牛，在瘦瘦的土地上耕耘，我就想，什么时候，想办法套住一个象或一头独角犀，让它们帮可怜的爷爷犁田……
    我想，什么时候，我能帮着爷爷放牧它们，吹着一只竹笛，骑在它们的背上，走进森林深处——沿着这条宽宽的，长长的路……
    爷爷在这块土地上累死了，终究没有看到我从森林里?出来的象或犀牛。
    我呢——
    同志，你先瞧瞧老爷爷说过的那条路，它变得双倍的宽！双倍的直！啊，你再看看印在这路面上的怪物的足迹，猜，它是象还是犀牛？！
    啊哈！让我告诉你吧：这是“履带拖拉机”——毛主席他老人家给我们的大铁犀牛啊！它刚刚走过，你要去看吗？好，走吧！
    顺着爷爷时候的这条路，森林那边就是我们的农场。
