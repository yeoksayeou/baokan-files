Xinhua News Agency, March 31st. Leaders of All-China Federation of Trade Unions, All-China Women's Federation, Communist Youth League, All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese Issue Statements:

The Unification of the Motherland Must Not Be Undermined

All-China Federation of Trade Unions

    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st. The person in charge of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on the armed rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, saying that the rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique is a completely perverse and sinful act that violates the interests of the Tibetan people, goes against the tide of history, and betrays the unification of the motherland and the unity of nationalities. The national working class resolutely supports all measures taken by the State Council to safeguard national unity and national unity, and believes that the Tibet Military Region, with the assistance of patriotic monks, nuns, and lay people in Tibet, will be able to completely quell the rebellion; the Tibetan people will surely embark on a bright road of prosperity and progress in the big family of the motherland.
    The person in charge said: "This incident once again tells us that imperialists and reactionaries are constantly conspiring to split our country and attempt to undermine our construction cause. We must not relax our vigilance for a moment on this."

All-China Women's Federation

    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st. The person in charge of the All-China Women's Federation issued a statement on the Tibetan rebellion, saying that the All-China Women's Federation feels extremely indignant at the shameless and sinful acts of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique colluding with imperialism, gathering rebellious bandits, betraying the motherland, and残害 the Tibetan people. We resolutely support the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and decide to have the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region exercise the functions of the Tibetan local government. This order fully represents the wishes of the vast masses of the people and fully conforms to the interests and demands of the broad working class and other upper and middle patriotic people in Tibet.
    The person in charge said that the All-China Women's Federation earnestly hopes that the working women of Tibet and all patriotic women, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will closely unite around the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and together with all patriotic monks, nuns, and lay compatriots in Tibet, vigorously assist the People's Liberation Army to completely quell the rebellion, consolidate national defense, and promote the consolidation of the unification of the motherland; and strive to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

Communist Youth League

    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st. The person in charge of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League issued a statement on the Tibetan rebellion, saying that all members of the Communist Youth League and the youth of the whole country fully support the State Council's order to quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion, and all measures taken by the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to suppress the rebellion.
    The person in charge of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League said that all reactionaries in the world always make wrong estimates of the situation because they are blinded by greed, and ignore the awakening and strength of the people. The upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet is the same. They regarded the central government's patient waiting and magnanimous attitude as weakness and deception, colluded with imperialism, and openly launched an armed rebellion. However, contrary to the wishes of imperialism and the Tibetan reactionary forces, the rebellion they launched did not cause the division of the motherland and the retrogression of Tibet, but promoted the demise of the reactionary forces and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.
    The person in charge of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League finally hoped that the youth of all ethnic groups in Tibet would further promote the spirit of patriotism, strengthen unity, vigorously assist the People's Liberation Army, and strive for the rapid and thorough suppression of the rebellion, for the maintenance of national unity and national unity, and for the construction of a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st. Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, issued a statement on the Tibetan rebellion, saying that we industrialists and businessmen, like the people of the whole country, resolutely support the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and order the People's Liberation Army to completely quell the rebellion, as well as all the measures taken.
    He said that the Tibetan local government and a small number of upper-class reactionary elements treated the central government's utmost benevolence and righteousness as weakness and deception, and dared to collude with imperialism and foreign reactionaries to openly launch an armed rebellion. This heinous crime of betraying the motherland is intolerable by national law and reason. The rebellion of the Tibetan local government and a small number of upper-class reactionary elements is precisely the day when their evil deeds are full and they bring about their own destruction, and it is also the day when the one million two hundred thousand compatriots in Tibet will further enjoy a bright and happy life. We industrialists and businessmen across the country are determined to unite more closely with the Tibetan compatriots and the people of all ethnic groups across the country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to resolutely safeguard the unification of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups.

All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese

    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st. Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, issued a statement today, resolutely supporting the State Council's order to quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion, and congratulating Tibet on beginning a new era of democracy and socialism.
    Chen Jiageng said that the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to launch an armed rebellion is an intolerable criminal act of betraying the motherland, undermining unity, and undermining national unity. The State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and quell the Tibetan rebellion is correct, timely, and necessary. Only in this way can we maintain the unification of the motherland and national unity.
    Chen Jiageng said that the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese have a fine patriotic tradition and are keenly concerned about the great cause of national reunification. The traitorous acts of the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet, regardless of the interests of the country and the nation, cannot but arouse the indignation of returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese abroad.
    Chen Jiageng finally said that the path taken by the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet is a path to self-destruction. The resolute measures taken by the central government against the Tibetan rebel group will quickly quell the rebellion in Tibet, the imperialists' conspiracy in Tibet will be completely smashed, and the national unity and unification of the motherland will be further consolidated.

    全总妇联共青团工商联侨联负责人发表谈话
    祖国的统一不容破坏
    全总
    新华社31日讯　中华全国总工会负责人就西藏上层反动集团进行武装叛乱发表谈话说，西藏上层反动集团的叛乱是完全违背西藏人民的利益、倒行逆施、背叛祖国统一和民族团结的罪恶行为。全国职工坚决拥护国务院为维护国家统一和民族团结而采取的一切措施，而且相信西藏军区在藏族爱国僧俗人民的协助下，一定能彻底平定叛乱；西藏人民在祖国的大家庭里一定会走上繁荣进步的光明大道。
    负责人说：“这一事件再一次告诉我们：帝国主义者和反动分子时刻在阴谋分裂我们的国家，企图破坏我国的建设事业。对此，我们一时一刻也不能放松警惕。”
    全国妇联
    新华社31日讯　全国妇女联合会负责人就西藏叛乱事件发表谈话说，全国妇联对西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义，纠集叛匪，背叛祖国，残害西藏人民的无耻罪恶行为，感到无比愤慨。我们坚决拥护国务院关于解散西藏地方政府，决定由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权的命令。这项命令完全代表了全国广大群众的意愿，完全符合西藏广大劳动阶级和其他上层、中层爱国人士的利益与要求。
    负责人说，全国妇联殷切地希望全藏的劳动妇女们和一切爱国妇女在中国共产党领导下，紧紧团结在西藏自治区筹备委员会的周围，与全藏爱国僧俗同胞一道，大力协助人民解放军，彻底平息叛乱，巩固国防，促进祖国统一的巩固；并为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。
    共青团
    新华社31日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会负责人就西藏叛乱事件发表谈话说，全体共青团员和全国青年完全拥护国务院关于平定西藏叛乱、解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府的命令和人民解放军西藏军区为讨平叛乱而采取的一切措施。
    共青团中央负责人说，世界上一切反动派总是利令智昏地对形势作出错误的估计，而无视人民的觉悟和力量的。西藏的上层反动集团也一样，他们把中央的耐心等待和宽大为怀的态度看作是软弱可欺，勾结帝国主义，公开发动了武装叛乱。但是和帝国主义以及西藏反动势力的愿望相反，他们所发动的叛乱，不是造成了祖国的分裂和西藏的倒退，而是促进了反动势力的灭亡，促进了西藏人民的新生。
    共青团中央负责人最后希望西藏各族青年更加发扬爱国主义精神，加强团结，大力协助人民解放军，为迅速、彻底地平定叛乱，为维护国家的统一和民族的团结，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。
    工商联
    新华社31日讯　中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通就西藏叛乱事件发表谈话说，我们工商业者和全国人民一样，坚决拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府、责成人民解放军彻底平息叛乱的命令以及所采取的一切措施。
    他说，西藏地方政府和一小撮上层反动集团分子把中央对他们仁至义尽的态度当作软弱可欺，竟敢勾结帝国主义和国外反动派公然发动武装叛乱，这种背叛祖国的滔天罪行，实为国法、情理所不容。西藏地方政府和一小撮上层反动集团分子的叛乱，正是他们恶贯满盈、自取灭亡的日子到了，也是西藏一百二十万同胞光明幸福生活进一步的日子到了。我们全国工商业者决心和西藏同胞以及全国各族人民一起，在中国共产党的领导下更加紧密地团结起来，坚决维护祖国的统一和各民族的团结。
    侨　联
    新华社31日讯　中华全国归国华侨联合会主席陈嘉庚今天发表谈话，坚决拥护国务院关于平息西藏叛乱、解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府的命令，并祝贺西藏开始民主和社会主义的新时期。
    陈嘉庚说，西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派发动武装叛乱，是一种不能容忍的背叛祖国、破坏统一、破坏民族团结的罪恶行为。国务院命令解散西藏地方政府和平息西藏叛乱，是正确的，及时的，必要的。只有这样才是维护祖国统一和民族团结的唯一的道路。
    陈嘉庚说，广大归国华侨、华侨家属和国外华侨素具爱国优良传统，热切关怀祖国的统一大业。西藏上层反动集团不顾国家民族利益的叛国行为，不能不激起归国华侨、华侨家属和国外华侨的愤慨。
    陈嘉庚最后说，西藏上层反动集团所走的道路，是自取毁灭的道路。中央对西藏叛乱集团采取的坚决的措施，将会迅速平息西藏的叛乱，帝国主义在西藏的阴谋，必将被彻底粉碎，祖国的民族团结和统一必将更加巩固。（附图片）
