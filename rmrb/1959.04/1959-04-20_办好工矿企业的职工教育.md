To do a Good Job in Workers' Education in Industrial and Mining Enterprises

In May 1958, the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party issued a great call to the whole Party and the people of the whole country for a technological revolution and a cultural revolution. Over the past year, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, mass technological and cultural revolution movements have been and are vigorously unfolding. As a necessary condition and component of the technological revolution and cultural revolution, the work of workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises has developed rapidly and improved. The National Conference on Workers' Education in Industrial and Mining Enterprises, recently held in Beijing, summarized past experiences, discussed the guidelines, tasks, and a number of important issues of workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises, based on the Party's education policy and the needs of socialist construction. The convening of this conference is timely and necessary and will have a positive effect on the development of workers' education.

Doing a good job in workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises is of great significance in China's socialist construction. In order to widely realize national industrialization, commune industrialization, and agricultural mechanization and electrification in our country, to build our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and to actively prepare conditions for the transition to communism, industrial and mining enterprises must, while carrying out production and construction, gradually popularize education at all levels among workers, continuously improve the political consciousness and cultural and technical level of the vast number of workers, and train a large number of cadres in a planned way. The work of workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises should shoulder such a task well.

The development of social production is determined by the working people. Under the socialist system, because the working people have become the masters of society, the dynamic role of people in social production can be fully developed, promoting the continuous improvement of labor productivity. This truth has been powerfully proven in the construction of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and has also been powerfully proven in our country. In building socialism, we should pay attention to both things and people, and while completing production tasks, we should attach importance to the work of cultivating people. This is because in modern industrial production, the enthusiasm of the masses is important, but cultural technology must keep up. Only by improving cultural technology can the enthusiasm of the masses be better brought into play, can new technological achievements be mastered by the masses, and can labor productivity be effectively improved. At the same time, in the long run, popularizing education among workers has far-reaching significance for realizing the intellectualization of the working class. Lenin said: "A communist society cannot be built in a country full of illiterates." He once pointed out that a communist society can only be established on the basis of modern knowledge, and if one does not understand modern knowledge, communism will always be just a wish.

In recent years, we have carried out some work in workers' education, and the cultural level of workers has been significantly improved. The situation that 70%-80% of the workers were illiterate or semi-illiterate before liberation has undergone fundamental changes, and most people have escaped illiteracy. However, the current cultural level of workers is still very low, and most people are still at the primary school level. This shows that continuing to carry out education work and improve the cultural and technical level of workers is still a serious task, and much hard work needs to be done in this regard.

The development of China's socialist construction requires a large number of cadres, especially technical cadres. At present, the technical force in industrial and mining enterprises is very insufficient, and with the development of the construction cause, the task of training technical cadres will become more urgent. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly pointed out that in order to build socialism, the working class must have its own large technical cadre team, and without this team, it will not work. Full-time universities and secondary specialized schools run by the state are important bases for training technical cadres; however, relying solely on full-time schools is far from enough, and industrial and mining enterprises must train a large number of technical cadres in production. It should be seen that industrial and mining enterprises have many favorable conditions for training cadres in production. Since liberation, industrial and mining enterprises have trained and promoted a large number of cadres from the working masses, and in the future, we should fully utilize the existing experience and vigorously strengthen this work.

How can we do a good job in workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises? The key lies in correctly implementing the Party's education policy in accordance with the characteristics of industrial and mining enterprises and workers. The policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor" put forward by the Party Central Committee must be conscientiously implemented in workers' education. Industrial and mining enterprises are production units, production is the primary task, and education and other work should serve production and be carried out with production as the center. Most of the workers are adults. They have a relatively high political awareness, more production experience and life knowledge, and bear production tasks and work tasks, and their labor is relatively tense. There are many differences between them in terms of industry, type of work, position, and age; their political awareness, production technology level, cultural level, and learning requirements are also very different. They generally have the burden of family life. These characteristics determine that running workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises must have appropriate differences from the requirements and practices of ordinary school education. According to the existing experience, especially the experience in the great leap forward in 1958, in the future, in implementing the Party's education policy in industrial and mining enterprises and doing a good job in workers' education, the following principles should be emphasized:

First, it is necessary to combine with production and serve production. Combining with production is a central issue for workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises. The content, methods, and systems of education should meet the needs of production and apply what is learned. Attention should be paid to the needs of current production, and long-term needs should also be appropriately taken care of. Political education, technical education, and cultural education should be combined. All comrades who run workers' education should care about production, learn the necessary production knowledge, understand the needs of production, and strengthen the idea of education serving production. Education work should play a role in promoting and improving production, and should strive politically and technically to ensure the completion of the 1959 production tasks.

Second, the form of schooling should be mainly spare-time, and the methods can be diverse. Workers' education can run specialized schools or ordinary schools. It can run schools with relatively complete curriculum settings, or it can run short-term training courses or supplementary education. In order to accelerate the training of apprentices and the training of cadres, schools or training courses can be run on a half-day or two- to three-hour daily basis and on a full-time basis under the condition that production in industrial and mining enterprises permits. The level and standards of workers' education should generally have appropriate requirements, but do not force uniformity. The learning methods should generally be based on class teaching, but small group learning, contracted teaching and guaranteed learning, personal self-study, and correspondence education can also be adopted.

Third, we must pay attention to the characteristics of adults and implement teaching according to their aptitude. In teaching, attention should be paid to utilizing the existing production experience and life knowledge of adults to improve teaching effectiveness. We must be good at distinguishing the characteristics and requirements of different workers and treat them separately. We must also distinguish the different characteristics and requirements of cadres and general workers.

Fourth, we must make unified arrangements and combine perseverance with flexibility. The Party and government leaders of industrial and mining enterprises should make unified and comprehensive arrangements for the production labor, study, life, and other after-work activities of workers. Judging from the existing experience in many cities, as long as the leaders of industrial and mining enterprises make unified arrangements and closely cooperate with the work of the streets and the work of the women's federations, and jointly do a good job in the welfare of workers and actively solve the difficulties for workers to participate in learning, it is possible for workers to achieve good production, good learning, and good rest. Running education in industrial and mining enterprises must be persistent, but there must be flexibility in specific mastery. Under normal production conditions, industrial and mining enterprises should guarantee a certain amount of study time each week. At the same time, the degree of production tension in industrial and mining enterprises often varies between different factories, workshops, and work sections, and between leading cadres and general workers; at different times, it is also sometimes tight and sometimes loose. This should also be arranged flexibly according to the specific situation.

In order to do a good job in workers' education in industrial and mining enterprises, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership. In the work, it is necessary to implement the mass line, strengthen supervision and inspection, earnestly run a number of workers' schools, and pay attention to summarizing and promoting advanced experience.

Popularizing education among the vast number of workers, training a large number of construction cadres, and realizing the intellectualization of the working class is a great and arduous historical task. Under the leadership of the Party, we must actively, practically, persistently, and unremittingly strive to gradually and victoriously complete this task over a long period of time.

　　办好工矿企业的职工教育
    1958年5月，党的八大二次会议，向全党和全国人民提出了技术革命和文化革命的伟大号召。一年来，在各级党委的领导下，随着工农业生产的大跃进，群众性的技术革命、文化革命运动，已经和正在蓬勃地展开。作为技术革命、文化革命的必要条件和组成部分的工矿企业职工教育工作，有了迅速的发展和提高。最近在北京召开的全国工矿企业职工教育工作会议，根据党的教育方针和社会主义建设的需要，总结了过去的经验，讨论了工矿企业职工教育的方针、任务和若干重要问题。这个会议的召开是及时的、必要的，对职工教育的开展将会发生积极的作用。
    办好工矿企业的职工教育，在我国社会主义建设中，有着重大的意义。为了在我国广泛地实现国家工业化、公社工业化和农业机械化电气化，将我国建成具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，为过渡到共产主义积极准备条件，工矿企业方面，就必须在进行生产建设的同时，在职工中逐步地普及各级教育，不断地提高广大职工的政治觉悟和文化技术水平，并且有计划地培养训练大量的干部。工矿企业的职工教育工作，应该把这样的任务很好地担负起来。
    社会生产的发展，劳动人民起着决定的作用。在社会主义制度下，由于劳动人民成了社会的主人，人在社会生产中的能动作用，才有可能充分发挥出来，推动劳动生产率的不断提高。这个真理，在苏联及其他社会主义国家的建设中得到了有力的证明，在我国也得到了有力的证明。我们建设社会主义应该既见物，又见人，在完成生产任务的同时，要重视培养人的工作。这是因为进行现代化的工业生产，群众的干劲是重要的，但是文化技术必须跟上去。提高了文化技术，群众的干劲才能更好地发挥作用，新的技术成就才能为群众所掌握，劳动生产率才能有效地提高。同时，从长远看，在职工中普及教育，对实现工人群众知识化，还有深远的意义。列宁说过：“在一个文盲充斥的国家内，是建成不了共产主义社会的。”他曾经指出，只有在现代知识的基础上，才能够建立共产主义社会，如果不通晓现代知识，共产主义始终不过是一种愿望而已。
    几年来，我们在职工教育方面已经进行了一些工作，职工的文化程度有了显著的提高。解放前职工中70％—80％是文盲、半文盲的状况，现在已经发生了根本的变化，多数人脱离了文盲状况。但是，目前职工的文化水平仍然是很低的，多数人还是小学程度。这说明，继续开展教育工作，提高职工的文化技术水平，还是一个严重的任务，在这方面还要作许多艰苦的工作。
    我国社会主义建设的发展，需要大量的干部，特别是技术干部。目前工矿企业中的技术力量是很不足的，随着建设事业的发展，培养技术干部的任务，将更加迫切。党中央和毛主席曾一再指出，为了建成社会主义，工人阶级必须有自己的宏大的技术干部队伍，没有这支队伍是不成的。国家举办的全日制的高等学校和中等专业学校，是培养技术干部的重要基地；但是，仅仅依靠全日制学校培养还很不够，工矿企业必须在生产中培养大量的技术干部。应该看到，工矿企业在生产中培养干部，有着许多有利的条件。解放以来，工矿企业已经从工人群众中培养提拔了大量的干部，今后应该充分运用已有的经验，大力加强这方面的工作。
    怎样才能办好工矿企业的职工教育呢？关键在于根据工矿企业和职工的特点正确地贯彻党的教育方针。党中央所提出的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的方针，必须在职工教育中认真执行。工矿企业是生产单位，生产是首要任务，教育和其他工作应该为生产服务，以生产为中心来进行。职工多数是成年人。他们的政治觉悟比较高，有较多的生产经验和生活知识，担负着生产任务和工作任务，劳动比较紧张。他们之间有行业、工种、职务、年龄等许多差别；政治觉悟、生产技术水平、文化程度和学习要求也很不相同。他们一般都有家庭生活的负担。这些特点就决定了在工矿企业中办职工教育，必须同普通学校教育的要求和作法有适当的区别。根据已有的经验，特别是1958年大跃进中的经验，今后在工矿企业中贯彻党的教育方针，办好职工教育，应该重视以下几个原则：
    首先，要结合生产，为生产服务。结合生产，对于工矿企业的职工教育来说，是一个中心问题。教育的内容、方法和制度，要适应生产的需要，学以致用。要重视当前生产的需要，同时也要适当照顾长远的需要。要把政治教育、技术教育、文化教育结合起来。一切办职工教育的同志，都应该关心生产，学习必要的生产知识，了解生产的需要，加强教育为生产服务的思想。教育工作要起推动和提高生产的作用，要在政治上、技术上为保证完成1959年生产任务而奋斗。
    其次，办学的形式要以业余为主，方法可以多种多样。职工教育，可以办专业学校，也可以办普通学校。可以办课程设置比较完整的学校，也可以办短期训练班或者补习性质的教育。为了加速培训徒工和培养干部，在工矿企业生产许可的条件下，可以举办半日制或每日学习二、三小时和全日制的学校或训练班。职工教育的水平和标准，一般应该有个适当的要求，但不要强求一律。学习的方式，一般应该以班级教学为主，也可以采取小组学习、包教保学、个人自修、函授教育等方式。
    第三，要重视成人特点，实行因材施教。在教学中，要注意利用成人已有的生产经验和生活知识，提高教学效果。要善于区别不同工人的特点和要求，分别对待。也要区别干部和一般工人群众的不同特点和要求。
    第四，要统一安排，坚持性和灵活性相结合。工矿企业的党政领导，应该对职工的生产劳动、学习、生活和其他工余活动，进行统一的全面的安排。从许多城市已有的经验看，只要工矿企业的领导上进行统一安排，并和街道工作、妇联的工作密切配合，共同办好职工的福利，积极解决职工参加学习的困难，是能够使职工作到生产好、学习好、休息好的。在工矿企业中办教育，要有坚持性，但在具体掌握上要有灵活性。在生产正常的情况下，工矿企业每周应该保证一定的学习时间。同时，工矿企业生产紧张的程度，在不同厂矿、车间、工段之间，领导干部和一般职工之间，又往往是不同的；在不同的时候，也有松有紧。这又应该根据具体情况，灵活安排。
    为了办好工矿企业的职工教育，必须加强党的领导。在工作中要贯彻群众路线，加强督促检查，切实办好一批职工学校，注意总结推广先进经验。
    在广大职工中普及教育，培养大量的建设干部，实现工人群众知识化，是一个伟大的艰巨的历史任务。我们必须在党的领导下，积极地踏实地坚持不懈地努力，争取在一个较长的时间内逐步胜利地完成这个任务。
