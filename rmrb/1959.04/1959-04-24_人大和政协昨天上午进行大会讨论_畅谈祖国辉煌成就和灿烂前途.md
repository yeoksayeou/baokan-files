Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: The First Session of the Second National People's Congress continued its plenary discussions this morning.

　　Eighteen representatives from all over the country spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically talking about the brilliant achievements of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational undertakings in various parts of our country. The hall resounded with enthusiastic applause as the representatives spoke.

　　NPC deputies Zhao Shoushan, Governor of Shaanxi Province, Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Governor of Fujian Province, and Guan Wenwei, Deputy Governor of Jiangsu Province, gave vivid introductions to the great leap forward of socialist undertakings in their respective provinces in 1958. Zhao Shoushan said that during the First Five-Year Plan, the total industrial and agricultural output value of Shaanxi Province only increased by 1.41 billion yuan, while it increased by 2.37 billion yuan in 1958 alone. The province has ended its thousands-year history of having no iron and steel industry, and with steel as the key link, has driven the rapid development of various industries. Northern Shaanxi, which has been short of grain for years, has become a grain-sufficient and surplus area after hard work in 1958. Deputy Chen Shaokuan's speech showed that Fujian Province achieved comprehensive and great victories in the cause of socialist construction and the struggle against the enemy in 1958. On the one hand, a wave of comprehensive leap forward emerged everywhere in the province, whether on the industrial, agricultural, transportation, cultural, educational, or health fronts; on the other hand, the heroic People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front, with the support of the people of the province, especially in the frontline areas, constantly inflicted punitive blows on the Chiang Kai-shek clique supported by US imperialism, causing US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to suffer disgraceful defeats in military and political terms. Guan Wenwei said in his speech that in 1958, based on the great victory of the people's rectification movement, the socialist mutual assistance and cooperation relations among the people of Jiangsu Province have greatly developed, which greatly promoted the further development of productive forces, making the cause of socialist construction advance by leaps and bounds. Guan Wenwei said that the broad masses warmly praised the leadership of the Party and the people's communes. The people of Jiangsu Province have a vivid saying: "Of all the principles, the Party's leadership is the most important; of all the plans, the mass line is the best; of all the good things, the people's commune is the best." Deputies such as Zhao Shoushan unanimously expressed in their speeches that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, they would thoroughly implement the spirit of this conference, mobilize all positive factors in every possible way, and comprehensively complete the national economic plan for the continued great leap forward in 1959.

　　Zhang Guofan, President of Tianjin University, Ji Wenfu of Zhengzhou University, and Liu Chengzhao, President of Sichuan Medical College, and other representatives, based on their own experiences, talked about the major gains of colleges and universities in various places after implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor.

　　The representatives who spoke at the meeting this morning also included: Huang Rongchang and Zhang Wenjin (joint speech), workshop directors of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Hu Ming, Secretary of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Guan Baojia, Governor of Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazak Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province, Han Wangchen, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, Zhang Dayu, Director of the Petroleum Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Li Neng, Secretary of the Jinning County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yunnan Province, Wang Huzhen, Chief Engineer of the Sanmenxia Project of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, Wu Yifang, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy in Jiangsu Province, Cui Dexi, Deputy Director of Hongshan Coal Mine in Shandong Province, Song Yiping, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Yang Weiyi, President of Jiangxi Agricultural College.

　　All the representatives expressed their agreement with the "Government Work Report" made by Premier Zhou Enlai, as well as the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

　　The plenary speeches were held in two venues this morning. The executive chairmen of the conference were Shen Junru, Yang Mingxuan, Lin Tie, Cai Tingkai, Xu Guangping, Li Fanwu, Cui Jiangong, Huang Yanpei, Rong Yiren, Zhou Lin, Gao Chongmin, Tang Shengzhi, Deng Fangzhi, and Yang Hanxian.

　　Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: The First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference began its plenary discussions this morning.

　　A total of thirty-one members spoke and gave joint speeches in two venues this morning. All the members who spoke expressed their complete agreement with the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan, and warmly supported the government work report and other reports of Premier Zhou Enlai.

　　Many members used what they had seen and heard or their own experiences in their speeches to explain the tremendous changes that have taken place in rural areas of our country, and the determination and drive of the broad masses of peasants to strive for continued great leap forward in 1959. CPPCC member Fang Dingying, Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, said that he visits rural areas every year, and his impression is that the situation is getting better every year. He recently inspected the Jinjing People's Commune in Changsha County. Last year, the average yield of grain per mu in this commune was 970 jin, an increase of 120% compared with before the commune. Wang Yukun, one of the three poor peasants in Nanwangzhuang, Hebei, who is known for resolutely taking the road of cooperativization, is now the production team leader of the commune. He said that after the wheat harvest last year, all 325 households in Nanwangzhuang village joined the people's commune. The commune members have a high enthusiasm for production. Last year, the average grain yield per mu reached 1,001 jin, an increase of more than three times compared with 231 jin per mu in 1957. His speech emphasized the importance of cadres participating in production and leading production. CPPCC member Yang Zilian, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, recently inspected the Weiqu People's Commune in Chang'an County. He said that the work of consolidating the commune in the past few months has achieved good results. The various systems of the commune are being improved, the production efficiency has been greatly improved, and the commune members are working hard with overwhelming momentum to strive for the continued great leap forward in 1959. The speech of CPPCC member Sun Lanfeng, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, reflected the prosperous scene of the people's communes in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, with both people and livestock thriving. In the Hubei region, where lakes are dotted everywhere, schistosomiasis and other diseases used to be serious. CPPCC member Yao Kefang, Director of the Hubei Provincial Department of Health, said in his speech that after several years, especially last year's vigorous prevention and treatment, among the 41 counties and cities in the province where schistosomiasis used to be prevalent, 4 counties and cities have sent away the "plague god," 8 counties and cities have basically eliminated it, and the patients in 22 counties and cities have been treated.

　　Zhou Huanzhang, President of Wuhan Institute of Technology, Hu Shitong, Chief Engineer of the Coal Industry Administration Bureau of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Gu Maoxun, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Bridge Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, and Liu Kunshui, Deputy Director of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, respectively introduced the great leap forward in various aspects such as Wuhan's chemical industry, Xinjiang's coal industry, railway bridge construction, and Chongqing's commercial work, in connection with their respective work.
