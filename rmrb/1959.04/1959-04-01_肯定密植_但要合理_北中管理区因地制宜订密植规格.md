Affirm Dense Planting, But Be Reasonable
    Beizhong Management Area Formulates Dense Planting Specifications According to Local Conditions

    (Our report) To ensure the specifications for dense planting of early rice this year, the Beizhong Management Area of the Shajiao People's Commune in the suburbs of Shantou City, Guangdong Province, specifically organized a major debate on the issue of dense planting of early rice before rice transplanting. This both refuted the argument of some people advocating for a return to sparse planting and prevented the tendency of "the denser, the better," laying a solid foundation for the implementation of reasonable dense planting.
    The Beizhong Management Area gained rich experience last year in promoting dense planting. However, because there was no thorough summary by the masses, and because there were still some shortcomings and problems in promoting dense planting last year, the members' understanding of dense planting varied. Therefore, the Party organization of the management area launched a major debate on the issue of dense planting of early rice among leading cadres and members.
    Individual members believed that dense planting was labor-intensive, that dense rice would rot and die, and that yields would not be high. However, most members affirmed that dense planting was better than sparse planting. They cited: last year, early rice planted at six by three [units of measure] yielded more than six by four, and a small number planted at five by three yielded more than six by three; last year, the entire management area further densely planted late rice, with a large area planted at five by two, and the 4,860 mu of sandy fields averaged 614 jin per mu, an increase of 33% compared to the previous year. Under the rebuttal of the vast majority of people, those who advocated for sparse planting felt they were in the wrong.
    Members of the Second Production Team, while affirming the benefits of dense planting, also proposed that dense planting should be reasonable and take into account local conditions, experience, and technical management level. This view was generally agreed upon by all production teams. Last year's practice proved that the previous saying of "the denser, the better" was unrealistic. After studying these opinions of the masses, the Party General Branch and Management Committee of the Beizhong Management Area both opposed right-leaning conservative thinking and paid attention to starting from local conditions and possibilities, formulating dense planting specifications according to local conditions.
    After the debate, everyone also focused on dense planting and conscientiously paid attention to implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" [referring to the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, a set of agricultural techniques promoted by Mao Zedong], so that various measures could be adapted to dense planting.

### 肯定密植　但要合理  北中管理区因地制宜订密植规格

    肯定密植　但要合理
    北中管理区因地制宜订密植规格
    本报讯　广东省汕头市郊外砂人民公社北中管理区为保证今年早稻密植规格，在插秧前专门组织了一次早稻密植问题的大辩论。既批驳了一部分人主张恢复疏植的论调，又防止了那种“越密越好”的倾向，为贯彻合理密植打下了可靠的基础。
    北中管理区去年推行密植，已经取得丰富的经验。但是，由于没有通过群众认真地总结，又加去年推行密植时还有一些缺点和问题，因此，社员们对密植的认识参差不齐。于是，管理区的党组织就在领导干部和社员中展开一场关于早稻密植问题的大辩论。
    个别社员认为密植费工，禾密要烂死，产量不高。但大部分社员肯定密植比疏植好。他们举出：去年早稻插六乘三的，就比六乘四增产，少数插五乘三的又比六乘三增产；去年全管理区晚稻更进一步密植，大面积插五乘二，四千八百六十亩沙田平均亩收六百一十四斤，比前年增产33％。在绝大多数人的反驳之下，主张疏植的人觉得理亏了。
    第二生产队的社员在肯定密植好处的同时，还提出密植要合理，要考虑到当地的条件、经验和技术管理水平，这个意见得到各个生产队的普遍赞同。去年的实践证明，过去那种“越密越好”的说法是不切实际的。北中管理区党总支和管理委员会研究了群众的这些意见后，既反对右倾保守思想，又注意从当地的条件和可能出发，因地制宜定出密植规格。
    在辩论结束后，大家还围绕密植为中心，切实注意贯彻“八字宪法”，使各项措施和密植能相适应。　（陈东维）
