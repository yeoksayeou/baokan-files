Tibetan People Love the Motherland and Love the Communist Party
Editor:
Premier Zhou's report speaks to my heart. The Party and government's care for our minority nationalities is truly meticulous. My hometown is in Luhuo, formerly in Xikang. In the few years since liberation, the government has issued loans every year to help develop production. Highways have been built to my hometown, and trucks have brought large quantities of tea, salt, and cloth. Now, every county and district has schools, and children of poor people can also go to school. Outstanding individuals are even sent to ethnic institutes for training. This is something I never even dreamed of in the past. Take myself, for example, I used to be a cowherd, but now I understand revolutionary principles, have become educated, and am an officer in the People's Liberation Army. All of this is due to the Party's cultivation and the help of Han comrades. The Tibetan people all say that the Communist Party is the sun, and without the Communist Party, there would be no today.

The reactionary upper strata in Tibet say that the People's Liberation Army destroys temples and religious beliefs, which is complete nonsense. The People's Liberation Army protects the religious beliefs and lama monasteries of the Tibetan people. Tibetans and lamas can freely chant scriptures, burn incense, and worship Buddha. However, a few bandits, under the guise of religion, use lama monasteries as strongholds to carry out armed rebellion and various counter-revolutionary activities, which is absolutely not allowed. Of course, we must resolutely strike at these bandits. It should be pointed out here that the rebellions in the Xikang area in the past were supported and instigated by the reactionary upper strata in Tibet. They sent agents and radio stations to incite some bandits, saying that Tibet would protect them, and if they couldn't win, they could flee to Tibet. Their unbridled sabotage of the Seventeen-Article Agreement, their creation of rebellions, and their collusion with imperialists and Indian expansionists to spread rumors and slanders against us are truly intolerable.

I resolutely support Premier Zhou's report. Everything in the report is the truth. The Tibetan people love the motherland and love the Communist Party. The people know very well who is their benefactor and who is their enemy. As a Tibetan soldier, I must firmly hold the gun in my hand, thoroughly suppress the scum among the Tibetans, defend the unity and territorial integrity of the motherland, and protect the happy life of the people of all nationalities.

Resolutely Crush the Conspiracy to Sabotage the Unity and Unification of the Motherland
Editor:
After listening to Premier Zhou's government work report, I was delighted and inspired by the unprecedented unity of all nationalities in the motherland and the great achievements of the motherland's socialist construction.

As a Mongolian soldier, I deeply understand the preciousness of the unity of all nationalities and the unification of the motherland from my own life experience. In the old society, millions of Mongolian people suffered the enslavement of feudal herdbosses. Since childhood, I myself was not well-fed or well-clothed, and herded sheep for the herdbosses on the desolate grasslands. Only under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the Han elder brothers, did the Mongolian people stand up. Now I myself have become a glorious soldier of the People's Liberation Army, and my hometown has also changed. Trains and cars have appeared on the desolate grasslands, and factories, farms, and ranches have been established. People are living a happy life in the people's communes. These achievements have been achieved because of the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the close unity and sincere cooperation of all nationalities.

However, the reactionary upper strata in Tibet, in order to maintain their bloody rule, colluded with imperialists and foreign reactionaries, openly violated the will of the people, and provoked an armed rebellion against the motherland, attempting to plunge the Tibetan people into a long-term abyss of poverty and backwardness. This heinous crime of theirs is absolutely not allowed by the people of all nationalities in the country. Premier Zhou's report on the Tibet issue fully expresses the wishes of the people of all nationalities in the motherland, and I resolutely support it.

Now, imperialists and Indian expansionists, vainly attempting to use the Tibetan rebellion to split our motherland, openly refer to China's Tibet as a "country," which is extremely infuriating. I am determined to join the people of all nationalities across the country to resolutely defend the unity of the motherland, defend the unity of all nationalities, and resolutely crush all conspiracies to undermine the unity and unification of our motherland.
People's Liberation Army Mongolian Officer, Su Ya Le Tu

The Face of Expansionist Ambitions Becomes More Obvious
Editor:
We feel extremely angry and can no longer tolerate the shameless interference by the ruling party of India and some leading figures of the Indian government in the Tibetan rebellion, which is purely our internal affair. Tibet is an inseparable and sacred territory of China, and we will never allow any imperialists and their agents, appearing in various guises, to interfere.

The so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials in Tezpur, the second "statement" issued in Mussoorie in the name of the Dalai Lama, and the remarks made by Indian diplomat Menon on the 22nd, reveal the despicable conspiracy of the rebellious elements and foreign reactionary forces who have kidnapped the Dalai Lama, exposing their ugly features. The true face of the Tibetan rebellious elements who kidnapped the Dalai Lama and took refuge in imperialists and foreign reactionaries, and the conspiracy of Indian expansionists, are becoming increasingly obvious.

We want to warn these expansionists that the era of arbitrarily manipulating China's internal affairs has long passed. China's 600 million people are fully capable of defending their sacred territory and sovereignty, and will not allow anyone to interfere in China's internal affairs. The Indian expansionists' serious provocative actions against the Chinese people, disregarding the just condemnation of the world's peace-loving people, especially the Chinese people and the broad masses of the Indian people, will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat. The attitude of some Indian officials indulging reactionary elements to please the imperialists is completely isolated and has no impact on China's unity and national solidarity, but it will bear serious consequences before the world's peace-loving people.

The Tibetan Rebels are the Common Enemy of All Our Nationalities
Editor:
When I saw the so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama," I felt extremely indignant. This so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama" said that "the Tibetan people are different from the Han people." I want to tell those foreign schemers that the Tibetan people are different from the Han people, they have different national characteristics; I am a Gaoshan (Taiwan aboriginal) from Taiwan, and I am also different from the Han people; however, we are all members of the big family of the motherland. The unification of the motherland is the highest interest of all the Chinese people of all nationalities. We resolutely oppose the activities of those who, under the guise of religion, secretly collude with imperialists and foreign reactionaries to betray the motherland.

Tibet is an inseparable part of China, and any support from outsiders for the armed rebellion in Tibet is an interference in China's internal affairs, which is not allowed by our 600 million Chinese people.

I want to warn the Indian expansionists to put down your black hands! You say "sympathy" for the Tibetan people, but which part of the people are you sympathizing with? You are sympathizing with that small group of traitors! They are the common enemy of all our nationalities.
Central Nationalities Institute Chinese Language Department Gaoshan Teacher, Tian Zhongshan

    休想破坏我国各民族的团结
    藏族人民热爱祖国热爱共产党编辑同志：
    周总理的报告，句句都说在我心坎上。党和政府对我们少数民族的关怀真是无微不至。我的家乡在原西康的炉霍，解放几年来，政府年年发放贷款，帮助发展生产，公路修到我的家乡，汽车载来了大批的茶、盐和布匹。现在每个县区都办了学校，穷人子弟也能上学了，优秀分子还被送到民族学院去培养，这真是过去想都没想到的事。拿我自己来讲，过去是个放牛娃，现在能懂得革命道理，有了文化，成了人民解放军的军官，这全是由于党的培养和汉族同志的帮助。藏族人民都说，共产党是太阳，没有共产党哪能有今天。
    西藏上层反动集团说什么解放军破坏寺庙和宗教信仰等，完全是胡说八道。解放军是保护藏民宗教信仰和喇嘛寺院的，藏民和喇嘛们可以自由地念经烧香供佛。但是，少数叛匪披着宗教外衣，以喇嘛寺为据点，进行武装叛乱和各种反革命活动，是决不允许的。我们对这些叛匪当然要给以坚决的打击。这里应该指出，过去西康地区叛乱是受到西藏上层反动集团支持和指使的，他们派出特务和电台，向一些叛匪煽动说有西藏保护你们，打不赢，你们可以往西藏跑。他们这样肆无忌惮地破坏十七条协议，制造叛乱，还勾结帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子对我们进行造谣诬蔑，实在是令人不能容忍。
    我坚决拥护周总理的报告，报告里讲的句句是真理。西藏人民热爱祖国、热爱共产党，谁是恩人，谁是仇敌，人民心里最清楚。做为一个藏族战士，我一定要紧握手中枪，彻底镇压藏民中的败类，保卫祖国的统一和领土的完整，保卫各民族人民的幸福生活。
    人民解放军藏民一团排长　亚玛泽容坚决粉碎破坏祖国团结统一的阴谋编辑同志：
    听了周总理的政府工作报告以后，我为祖国各民族的空前团结、为祖国社会主义建设的伟大成就感到欢欣鼓舞。
    作为一个蒙族战士，我从自己生活经历当中深刻体会到祖国各民族的团结和祖国的统一的可贵。在旧社会，千百万蒙族人民身受着封建牧主的奴役。我自己从小吃不饱、穿不暖，在荒凉的草原上给牧主放羊。只是在党和毛主席的领导下、在汉族老大哥的帮助下，蒙族人民才翻了身。现在我自己成了人民解放军的光荣战士，家乡也变了样，在荒凉的草原上出现了火车、汽车，建立了工厂和农场、牧场，人们在人民公社中过着幸福的生活。这些成就，都是由于有了党和毛主席的领导、有了各族的亲密团结和真诚合作才获得的。
    但是，西藏上层反动集团为了维持它们的血腥统治，竟勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，公然违背人民的意志，挑起背叛祖国的武装叛乱，企图使西藏人民长期陷入穷苦落后的深渊。他们这种滔天罪行是全国各族人民所决不允许的。周总理报告中对西藏问题的论述，充分表达了祖国各族人民的愿望，我坚决拥护。
  　现在，帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，妄想利用西藏叛乱事件，分裂我们祖国，公然把我国的西藏说成是“国家”，令人万分愤慨。我决心和全国各族人民一道，坚决保卫祖国的统一，保卫各民族的团结，坚决粉碎一切破坏我们祖国团结统一的阴谋。
    人民解放军蒙古族军官　苏雅乐图
    扩张野心的面貌愈加明显了编辑同志：
    我们对印度执政党和印度官方的一些领袖人物，利用纯属我国内政的西藏叛乱事件，进行无耻干涉的行为，感到无比的愤怒，实在忍无可忍。西藏是中国神圣不可分割的领土，我们绝不允许任何帝国主义者和他们的以各种面目出现的代理人进行干涉。
    在提斯浦尔由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”和在穆索里第二次以达赖喇嘛名义发表的“声明”，以及印度外交官梅农22日的谈话，使叛乱分子和外国反动势力挟持达赖喇嘛所进行的卑鄙阴谋昭然若揭，丑态毕露。西藏叛乱分子挟持达赖喇嘛、投靠帝国主义和外国反动派的真实面目和印度扩张主义分子的阴谋，暴露的愈来愈加明显。
    我们要警告这些扩张主义者，任意摆布中国内政的时代早已过去了，中国六亿几千万人民完全有能力保卫自己神圣的领土和主权，不容任何人干涉中国内政。印度扩张主义分子不顾世界爱好和平的人民，尤其是中国人民和印度广大人民的正义指责，对中国人民进行的这种严重挑衅的行为，必遭到可耻的失败。印度某些官方人士纵容反动分子取悦帝国主义的态度是完全孤立的，对中国的统一和民族团结毫无影响，但却将在世界爱好和平人民的面前承担其严重的后果。
    回民学院全体师生员工
    西藏叛匪是我们各民族的共同敌人编辑同志：
    当我看到所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”以后，感到万分愤慨。这个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，说什么“西藏人民不同于汉人”。我要正告那些外国野心家们，西藏人是不同于汉人，他们有不同的民族特点；我是台湾高山族人，也不同于汉人；但是，我们都是祖国大家庭的一员。祖国的统一，是我们中国全国各族人民的最高利益。我们坚决反对那些披着宗教外衣暗地里勾结帝国主义及外国反动派进行背叛祖国的人的活动。
    西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，任何外人对西藏武装叛乱分子的支持，都是对于中国内政的干预，是我们六亿多中国人民不容许的。
    我要警告印度扩张主义分子们，放下你们的黑手吧！你们口口声声说“同情”西藏人，你们究竟是同情哪部分人呢？你们所同情的就是那一小撮叛国分子！他们是我们全国各族人民的共同敌人。
