Xinhua News Agency, April 14th. The State Council issued notices on March 29th and April 4th successively, requiring key marine fishing provinces and cities such as Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Shanghai to seize the peak season of marine fishing and further improve the catching, purchasing, and transporting of prawns, yellow croakers, and other aquatic products.

The notice stated that the peak season for marine fishing is approaching, and all regions must make further efforts to grasp the catching, purchasing, and transporting of prawns, yellow croakers, and other aquatic products during the marine fishing season, ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the second-quarter production, purchasing, transporting, and export plans issued by the Ministry of Aquatic Products.

To accomplish this task, the State Council requires all regions to do the following:

　　I. Strengthen organizational leadership. The deputy provincial (municipal) governors in charge of aquatic products in each province (city) should personally oversee the catching, purchasing, and transporting work during the fishing season. Further improve the organization of the fishing season headquarters, strengthen communication between higher and lower levels, and quickly and effectively resolve specific problems in production, purchasing, and transportation.

　　II. Properly arrange labor. Based on this year's production tasks, the number of fishing boats and fishermen going to sea should increase compared to the same period last year, and at the very least should not be less than last year. All transferred fishermen and fishing boats should return to the team as much as possible, and key fishing areas with insufficient labor should appropriately draw on a portion of labor to supplement.

　　III. Do a good job in supplying materials. The People's Committees of each province (city) should conduct an inspection of the supply of materials needed for the fishing season, and any missing materials should be resolved as much as possible. Some materials needed for fishery production, such as timber, diesel, and tung oil, are under the unified distribution of the state or are managed by relevant central ministries. Currently, due to the large demand from all parties and the limited supply, the People's Committees of each province (city) are required to take into account the needs of fisheries when uniformly distributing these materials, especially during the fishing season. At the same time, all regions must rely on the masses, organize local resources, and solve the problem of material supply by actively finding substitutes and saving on the use of materials.

　　IV. Strengthen the handling of fish catches. Commercial departments must vigorously carry out the purchasing of aquatic products. All aquatic products that should be purchased must be purchased completely. The purchased aquatic products should be transferred out in a timely manner, and those that cannot be transferred out for the time being should be processed and stored locally. In order to do a good job in the external transfer of aquatic products, all regions should organize short-distance transportation forces and establish close contact with transportation and railway departments, striving to ensure that fish catches are transported as soon as they arrive.

Xinhua News Agency, April 14th. The spring marine fishing season has already achieved preliminary results. According to statistics from the Ministry of Aquatic Products, the catch of various aquatic products in the first quarter of this year is higher than the output in the same period last year. Now that the peak fishing season has arrived, the vast number of fishermen in coastal provinces are sailing their fishing boats day and night on the vast and turbulent seas. They are diligently casting nets, searching for schools of fish, going out to sea early, and returning to port late, striving for even greater harvests.

Before the arrival of the fishing season, in order to seize the first great harvest of marine fishery production after collectivization, all regions broke the old habit of "opening the sea only after Qingming" and set sail ahead of schedule. Thanks to the further in-depth political and ideological work in the people's communes, everyone's production enthusiasm is very high. Fishermen in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, put forward the slogan of striving to overfulfill their tasks. Some people's communes along the coast of Jin County, Liaoning, organized fishermen's families as the "logistics department" to support the fishermen going out to sea in various ways. To solve the difficulty of insufficient supply of fishing materials, they helped aquatic product supply and marketing companies to excavate 2,200 tons of wild plant substitutes such as kudzu vines, rattan, steel grass, and tree bark for making ropes, and carried out work such as weaving nets, mending nets, and processing and manufacturing ropes and fishing lines.

Unified leadership, centralized command, and organizing the fishing fleets of various people's communes to encircle and catch schools of fish according to the fish situation are the characteristics of this year's spring fishing season production in various regions. Hebei Province established a fishing season headquarters with the participation of aquatic products, commerce, transportation, meteorology, and other units, and each special zone and county (city) in the fish-producing area also established headquarters. Guangdong, Shandong, and other provinces and special zones have also mostly established headquarters. All major fishing ports have established command organizations to uniformly command fishing season production. A large number of red fish were discovered in the Pearl River Estuary area of Guangdong Province. Six small fishing boats from Doumen People's Commune in Zhongshan County first caught more than 110,000 catties in the Yaimenkou fishing ground in two days. As soon as the fishing season information was released, the fishing fleets of Zhongshan, Taishan, Bao'an, and other counties quickly set sail and tracked them down, and the catch volume greatly increased.

Vigorously carrying out technological innovation and improving labor productivity is another feature of this spring fishing season production. In order to achieve successful voyages for every boat and full holds for every warehouse, many regions have summarized last year's experience in high yields and fully exploited their production potential. The vast number of fishermen in Yantai Special Zone, Shandong, prominently focused on net reform to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor. Li Rixing, the captain of the motor vessel of Yantai Aquatic Products Company, greatly improved production through technological innovation and overfulfilled the first quarter's plan by 46%.

In order to strive for greater achievements in the peak fishing season, coastal regions are strengthening the leadership of fishing season work, improving command organizations at all levels, and further mobilizing and organizing more fishermen and boats to engage in catching production.

　　力争仓仓鱼满船船告捷
　　国务院通知沿海各地抓紧渔汛旺季捕捞收购调运工作
    广大渔民在第一季初捷之后乘胜前进力争更大丰收
    新华社14日讯　国务院在3月29日，4月4日连续发出通知，要求辽宁、河北、山东、江苏、浙江、福建、广东、上海等海洋捕鱼重点省、市，抓紧海洋渔汛的大旺季节，进一步做好对虾、黄花鱼和其他水产品的捕捞、收购和调运工作。
    通知说，目前海洋渔汛的大旺季节已经来临，各地必须进一步努一把力，把海洋渔汛期间对虾、黄花鱼和其他水产品的捕捞、收购、调运工作抓紧、抓狠、抓实，保证完成和超额完成水产部下达的二季度生产、收购、调运和出口计划。
    为完成这一任务，国务院要求各地做好以下几件工作：
    一、加强组织领导、各省（市）主管水产工作的副省（市）长应该亲自掌握渔汛时期的捕捞、收购和调运工作。进一步健全渔汛指挥部的组织，密切上下联系，迅速、切实地解决生产、收购、调运工作中的具体问题。
    二、妥善安排劳力。根据今年的生产任务，出海渔船、渔民应该比去年同期有所增加，最低限度不要少于去年。凡转业的渔民和渔船都应该尽可能地归队，劳力不足的重点渔区还应该酌情抽调一部分劳力加以补充。
    三、做好物资供应工作。各省（市）人民委员会对于渔汛所需物资的供应工作应当进行一次检查，所缺物资应尽可能地加以解决。有些渔业生产所需物资和木材、柴油、桐油等是属于国家统一分配或者是由中央有关各部主管的，目前因为各方面的需要量很大，而货源又有一定的限制，因此，要求各省（市）人民委员会在统一分配这些物资的时候，应该根据统筹兼顾的原则，供应渔业的需要，特别在渔汛期间更应该给以照顾。同时，各地还必须依靠群众、组织地方资源，通过积极寻找代用品和节约使用物资等办法来解决物资供应问题。
    四、加强鱼货处理工作。商业部门必须大力开展水产品的收购工作，凡是应该收购的，都要全部收购起来；收购的水产品应该及时外调，一时不能外调的部分应该就地加工、就地贮存。为了做好水产品的外调工作，各地应该组织好短途运输力量，并同交通、铁道部门取得密切联系，力争做到鱼货随到随运。
    新华社14日讯　海洋春季渔汛生产已经取得了初步成绩。据水产部统计，今年第一季度捕捞的各种水产品高于去年同期的产量。现在，渔汛大旺季到来了，沿海各省广大渔民正驾着渔船，日夜奔驰于长空万里、波涛汹涌的海洋上。他们勤开网、找鱼群，早出海、晚收港，在力争更大的丰收。
    渔汛到来前，各地为夺取公社化后第一个海洋渔产大丰收，打破了“清明才开海”的旧习惯，提前扬帆出海。由于人民公社政治思想工作的进一步深入，大家的生产情绪十分高涨。浙江舟山渔民提出争取超额完成任务的口号。辽宁金县沿海的一些人民公社，组织渔民家属作“后勤部”，用各种方式支援出海远征的渔民。为解决渔需物资供应不足的困难，他们帮助水产供销公司挖掘出打绳索的山葛子、藤条、钢草、树皮等野生植物代用品二千二百吨，并进行织网、补网、加工制造绳索和渔线等工作。
    统一领导、集中指挥，根据鱼情组织各人民公社的渔船队进行围捕鱼群，是今年各地春汛生产的特点。河北省成立了有水产、商业、交通、气象等单位参加的渔汛指挥部，产鱼区各专区、县（市）也成立了指挥部。广东、山东等地省和专区也大都成立了指挥部。各主要渔港都成立了指挥机构，统一指挥渔汛生产。广东省珠江口一带发现大批赤鱼，中山县斗门人民公社六艘小渔船先在崖门口渔场两天捕了十一万多斤，渔汛情报一发出，中山、台山、宝安等县的渔船队，迅速扬帆追踪，捕获量大大增加。
    大力开展技术革新、提高劳动生产率是今春渔汛生产的另一个特点。为了达到船船告捷、仓仓鱼满，很多地区总结了去年的丰产经验，充分发挥了生产潜力。山东烟台专区广大渔民突出地抓住了网具改革，以解决劳力不足的困难。烟台水产公司机轮船长李日兴经过技术革新，大大提高了产量，超额46％完成了第一季度计划。
    沿海各地为了争取渔汛旺季取得更大的成绩，正在加强对渔汛工作的领导，健全各级指挥机构，进一步发动和组织更多的渔民和船只投入捕捞生产。
