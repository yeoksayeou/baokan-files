Xinhua News Agency, April 1st dispatch from New York: Due to the U.S. government's continuous nuclear weapon tests, the threat of atomic radiation to the United States has increased unprecedentedly.

    According to a report in the American magazine "Newsweek" on March 31, the northern United States has become the region with the highest atomic radiation in the world. "Newsweek" believes that this "has not yet reached its peak." The magazine quoted materials from a recent Atomic Energy Commission report stating: "The amount of Strontium-90 contained in the soil of New York City has increased sevenfold since the first measurement in 1954."

      "Newsweek" concluded by saying that most of America's renowned scientists are unanimously "deeply concerned" about the problem of atomic particles and radiation.

Xinhua News Agency, March 31st dispatch from Washington: Professor Linus Pauling of the California Institute of Technology, a Nobel Prize laureate, yesterday at a press conference in San Francisco, accused the U.S. government of intentionally downplaying the serious danger that radioactive fallout from nuclear tests poses to the American people. He demanded a halt to nuclear weapon tests to eliminate the threat to the American people.

    Dr. Pauling told reporters that, according to his estimates, currently 50,000 Americans will die or suffer misfortune due to cancers caused by radioactive fallout from nuclear tests. If the tests continue, the death and injury rate caused by this radioactive fallout may be seven times higher than this number.

    Dr. Pauling emphasized that in order to free mankind from this unfortunate impact, nuclear weapon tests must be banned.

Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd dispatch, quoting TASS, New York, April 1st: The increase in atomic radiation in the United States caused by the continued U.S. testing of nuclear weapons has aroused great anxiety and indignation among the American people. The American public has been calling on the U.S. government to stop nuclear weapon tests.

    "Newsweek" wrote: "Many letters have been sent to the capital in one week" demanding a halt to nuclear weapon tests. An eighteen-year-old girl from Audubon, Iowa, wrote: "You damned guys! You members of the Congressional Atomic Energy Committee! Who the hell allowed the Department of Defense or the Atomic Energy Commission, allowed any other agency that should be responsible for this, to test nuclear weapons?" The call for a halt to nuclear weapon tests is expressed even more sincerely in a letter to the editor of the "Capital Times" published in Madison, Wisconsin. The sender wrote: "Let's do something to stop atomic weapons and achieve universal disarmament. The tests conducted so far have already infected the air... Let's not conduct any new tests to make the situation worse. End it now before it's too late."

    The "Capital Times" pointed out that the Atomic Energy Commission's notification on the dangers of continuing nuclear weapon tests is untrue.

    美国北部成为全世界原子辐射最强烈地区
    美国科学家严重忧虑灾难性后果
    据新华社1日讯　纽约消息：由于美国政府不断进行核武器试验，原子辐射对美国的威胁空前增加。
    据美国“新闻周刊”3月31日报道，美国北部已经成为全世界原子辐射最强的地区。“新闻周刊”认为，这“还没有达到最高点”。这家杂志引用原子能委员会最近报告的材料说：“纽约市泥土中所含有的锶一九十已经比1954年第一次测定时增加了七倍。”
      “新闻周刊”最后说，美国大部分著名的科学家一致对原子微粒和辐射问题感到“深切的忧虑”。
    新华社31日讯　华盛顿消息：美国加利福尼亚理工学院教授、诺贝耳奖金获得者保林博士昨天在旧金山举行的记者招待会上指责美国政府有意缩小核试验放射性微尘给美国人民带来的严重危险，他要求停止核武器试验以免除对美国人民的威胁。
    保林博士告诉记者说，据他估计，目前有五万个美国人将由于核试验的放射性微尘引起的癌症而死亡或遭到不幸。如果试验继续下去，由于这种放射性微尘而引起的死伤率可能要比这个数目高七倍。
    保林博士强调指出，为了使人类摆脱这种不幸的影响，必须禁止核武器试验。
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社纽约1日讯：由于美国继续试验核武器而造成的美国原子辐射的增加，引起美国人民极大的不安与愤慨。美国公众纷纷要求美国政府停止核武器试验。
    “新闻周刊”写道：“一个星期内，就有许多信件寄往首都”，要求停止核武器试验。奥都本（衣阿华州）一位十八岁的姑娘写道：“你们这些该死的家伙！你们这些国会原子能委员会的委员们！到底是谁允许国防部或原子能委员会，允许应该负这方面责任的其他任何机构试验核武器？”要求停止试验核武器的呼声在给麦迪逊（威斯康星州）出版的“首府时代报”编辑的一封信中表现得更真诚。寄信人写道：“为了停止原子武器和达到普遍裁减军备的目的，让我们来做点事情吧。到目前为止所进行的这些试验已经感染了空气……我们不要再进行新的试验使情况变得更严重了。趁现在还不晚就结束它吧。”
    “首府时代报”指出，原子能委员会就继续试验核武器的危险性发表的通报是不符事实的。
