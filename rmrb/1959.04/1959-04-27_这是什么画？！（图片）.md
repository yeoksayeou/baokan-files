This is a cartoon published in the "Times of India" on March 25th. The title above it is "The Abominable Snowman." The so-called "Abominable Snowman" in the picture holds an olive branch in his left hand and a wooden sign in his right hand that reads "Coexistence." The words written on the house are "Tibet." This cartoon viciously smears our Central People's Government's exercise of sovereignty in Tibet as a barbaric "snowman" who is trampling on Tibet under the banner of peace and coexistence. The "snowman's" appearance clearly alludes to Chairman Mao, the Chinese head of state. (Xinhua News Agency draft)

This is a cartoon published in the Indian "Mail" on April 1st. It viciously smears our suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as a "barbaric" act, and even depicts our national leaders as "barbarians." The building in the picture on the right, shaped like the United Nations Building, is labeled: "United Nations - Civilization - Does not admit China." The person being grabbed by the hair is labeled "Tibet." The sentence below says: "They treat us like barbarians, well, let's act like barbarians!" (Xinhua News Agency draft)

    这是什么画？！
    图是“印度时报”3月25日刊登的漫画。上面的标题是“可恶的雪人”。图中的所谓“可恶的雪人”左手拿的是橄榄枝，右手举着的木牌上写着“共处”，房子上写的字是“西藏”。这幅漫画恶毒地诬蔑我中央人民政府在西藏行使主权是打着和平与共处招牌而实际上践踏西藏的野蛮“雪人”。图中“雪人”的面貌显然影射着中国元首毛主席。　（新华社稿）
    图是印度“邮报”4月1日刊登的漫画。它恶毒地诬蔑我平定西藏叛乱是“野蛮”的行为，并且竟然把我国国家领导人描绘成“野蛮人”。图中右边的那幢联合国大厦形状的建筑物上写的是：“联合国——文明——不接纳中国参加”，被揪着头发的那个人身上写着“西藏”，下面的一句话是：“他们把咱们当作野蛮人，好吧，咱们就像野蛮人一样行动吧！”　（新华社稿）
