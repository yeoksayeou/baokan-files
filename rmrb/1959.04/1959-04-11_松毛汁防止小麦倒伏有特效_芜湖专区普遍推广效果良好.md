Pine Needle Juice Has Special Effect in Preventing Wheat Lodging
Wuhu Area Universally Promotes with Good Results
    Our newspaper Hefei, 10th dispatch: Tun Guang People’s Commune in Tunxi City, Anhui Province, has achieved good results in preventing wheat lodging by using pine needle juice mixed with phosphate rock powder; it has been universally promoted in the Wuhu area with significant effectiveness.
    The five thousand acres of wheat in Tun Guang People’s Commune are growing very well. However, upon inspection, a small number of wheat plants were found to be lodging. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the commune's technical research group, referring to Zhejiang Province's method of using pine needle juice to prevent rice lodging, sprayed pine needle juice on the lodged wheat in the experimental group's high-yield fields on March 4th. Five days later, all the lodged wheat had recovered and stood upright, growing the same as the wheat nearby that had not lodged.
    Using pine needle juice mixed with phosphate rock powder to prevent wheat lodging can utilize local materials and is simple and easy to implement. The specific method is: (1) Material collection: Pine needles (pine leaves) from pine trees or fallen pine needles can be used, but fresh pine needles picked from trees are preferred. (2) Dosage: Forty catties of pine needles, one hundred catties of water, and three catties of phosphate rock powder. (3) Preparation: Boil the pine needles and water for about thirty minutes (until the pine needles are soft), then add the phosphate rock powder and boil together until it becomes a brownish-blue juice. (4) Usage: Filter the prepared pine needle juice with gauze, add one part clean water, and spray with a sprayer. If the wheat lodging is not serious, more water can be added.
    Pine needle juice mixed with phosphate rock powder can prevent wheat lodging because it contains fast-acting phosphorus and potassium components that can promote the healthy growth of wheat seedling stalks. According to recent analyses of pine needle juice using two methods by the Wuhu Area Agricultural Bureau: (1) After boiling eleven catties of pine needles in one hundred catties of water for half an hour, the analysis results were: containing 0.007% phosphorus and 0.0963% potassium. (2) After soaking pine needles in a jar with water for twelve hours, the analysis results were: containing 0.013% phosphorus and 0.007% potassium. They used these two types of water to experiment on lodged wheat seedlings and found that the second type was more effective.
    The method of using pine needle juice mixed with phosphate rock powder to prevent wheat lodging has been fully promoted in Tun Guang Commune and Wuhu Area. Tun Guang Commune has sprayed pine needle juice on over one thousand acres of wheat that were growing excessively, and after three or four days, the wheat that had originally lodged or had a tendency to lodge all stood upright. Miao Bu Brigade of Chengguan Commune in Xuancheng County found that 7.5 acres of wheat had lodged; following the method of Tun Guang Commune, they sprayed with pine needle juice and also restored normal growth. Currently, more than 110,000 acres of wheat fields in Wuhu Area have been sprayed with pine needle juice, with good results. At a recent telephone conference of the secretaries of the prefectural and municipal Party committees convened by the Anhui Provincial Party Committee to specifically study the prevention of wheat lodging, it was also requested that this method be universally promoted.

### 松毛汁防止小麦倒伏有特效  芜湖专区普遍推广效果良好

　　松毛汁防止小麦倒伏有特效
　　芜湖专区普遍推广效果良好
    本报合肥10日电　安徽省屯溪市屯光人民公社，用松毛汁掺磷矿粉防治小麦倒伏获得良好效果；在芜湖专区普遍推广，也有显著成效。
    屯光人民公社的五千多亩小麦长得很好。但据检查，发现少数小麦有倒伏现象。这个公社技术研究组在党委领导下，参考浙江省用松毛汁防治水稻倒伏的办法，于3月4日，在试验组的丰产田里，对已倒伏的小麦喷射松毛汁，五天后，已倒伏的小麦全部恢复直立，和附近没有倒伏的小麦生长得一样。
    用松毛汁掺磷矿粉防治小麦倒伏，能就地取材，简便易行。具体做法是：（1）取材：采用松树上的松毛（松针）或落地的松毛都可以，但以树上采下来的新鲜松毛为好。（2）配量：松毛四十斤，水一百斤，磷矿粉三斤。（3）制法：将松毛和水约煮三十分钟（松毛发软即可），然后加上磷矿粉一起煮沸，成褐蓝色汁水。（4）用法：将制好的松毛汁水用纱布过滤后，加上一倍的清水，装入喷雾器内喷射。小麦倒伏不严重的，可以多加水。
    松毛汁掺磷矿粉能防治小麦倒伏，是由于其中含有能够促使麦苗基秆壮健的速效磷、钾成份。据最近芜湖专区农业局用两种方法对松毛汁进行化验后分析：（1）用一百斤水加十一斤松毛煮沸半小时后，分析结果：含磷0.007％，钾0.0963％。（2）把松毛放在缸内，加水浸十二小时后，分析结果：含磷0.013％，钾0.007％。他们用这两种水分别对倒伏的麦苗进行试验，发现第二种效果更好些。
    用松毛汁掺磷矿粉防治小麦倒伏的办法，已在屯光公社和芜湖专区全面推广。屯光公社已把疯长过甚的一千多亩小麦，喷洒了松毛汁，经三、四天后，原来倒伏的或有倒伏趋势的小麦都直立起来。宣城县城关公社庙埠大队，发现七点五亩小麦有倒伏现象；仿照屯光公社的办法，用松毛汁喷洒过后，也恢复了正常生长。目前芜湖专区已有十一万多亩麦田用松毛汁水喷洒过，效果良好。最近中共安徽省委召开的专门研究防治小麦倒伏的地、市委书记电话会议上，也要求普遍推广。
