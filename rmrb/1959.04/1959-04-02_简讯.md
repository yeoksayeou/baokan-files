    Largest Train Ferry
    Following the launch of the "Jiangsu" train ferry, another train ferry named "Jinling" was launched in Shanghai on the 26th.
    The "Jinling" and "Jiangsu" are sister ships, both with a displacement of 5,100 tons, making them the largest train ferries in China today. They were both built by the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard to accommodate the construction of the Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai-Nanjing double-track railway projects. They will operate on the Yangtze River between Nanjing and Pukou, each capable of carrying more than 1,000 carriages per day.

    Developing Virgin Forests
    Guangdong Province is accelerating the development of four major virgin forests: Jianfengling, Diaoluoshan, Bawangling in Hainan, and Ruyang in northern Guangdong. Once the development projects are completed next year, these four forest areas will produce more than 1.5 million cubic meters of timber annually, exceeding the total timber production of Guangdong Province in 1957.

    Jewel Bearings
    The Jinzhou Jade Factory has successfully trial-produced jewel bearings. After appraisal, the precision is fully qualified, and large quantities of orders have been received and put into production.
    Jewel bearings are indispensable and valuable parts in electric meters and instruments. In the past, China could not manufacture them and relied entirely on imports.

    The Ceramic Research Institute of the Tangshan Ceramics Industry Bureau has trial-produced two high-grade coloring materials for painting fine porcelain - gold water and selenium red. Porcelain painted and fired with these materials has particularly good color, gloss, and yellowness.
