Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 16th: According to a report in the Vietnamese "People's Daily" today, Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, wrote a letter to the Chairman of the International Commission in Vietnam on April 11th, protesting the illegal presence of U.S. military personnel, especially the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), in South Vietnam, and demanding the immediate withdrawal of the MAAG and other U.S. military personnel from South Vietnam.

The letter pointed out that at a time when the activities carried out by U.S. imperialism through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) are making the situation in Southeast Asia increasingly tense, the presence and activities of the U.S. MAAG in South Vietnam are a threat to peace and tranquility in the Southeast Asian region.

The letter stated that Colonel Ha Van Lau pointed out in his letter of January 7th of last year that the South Vietnamese authorities agreed in February 1955 to allow the United States to directly control the work of building the South Vietnamese army, and made the U.S. MAAG responsible for organizing and training the South Vietnamese army. The letter said that for several years, U.S. imperialism has been shipping thousands of military advisors and personnel, and tens of thousands of tons of weapons and war materials into South Vietnam through the U.S. MAAG, and building military projects such as airports, naval ports, warehouses, and strategic highways in South Vietnam to strengthen South Vietnam's military power. Officers from the U.S. MAAG have also directly participated in and commanded the South Vietnamese army's "sweeps" to persecute, massacre, and arrest the South Vietnamese people. Recently, two more U.S. generals have been sent to the U.S. MAAG.

Ha Van Lau pointed out in the letter that after the signing of the Geneva Accords, the "Agreement on Joint Defense Assistance for Indochina" signed by the United States, France, and the Bao Dai government on December 23, 1950, has completely lost its validity. Therefore, the U.S. MAAG, which was created by the above agreement, can no longer continue to exist, and its advisors and military personnel must withdraw from South Vietnam. At the same time, the aforementioned "Agreement on Joint Defense Assistance for Indochina" and the February 1955 agreement on the establishment of the U.S. MAAG in South Vietnam must be cancelled.

　　越南人民军代表致函国际委员会主席
　　要求美军事人员撤出南越
    新华社河内16日电　据越南“人民报”今天报道，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校4月11日写信给越南国际委员会主席，抗议美国军事人员，特别是美国军事顾问团的非法留在南越，并且要求顾问团和其他美国军事人员立即撤出南越。
    信中指出，当美帝国主义通过东南亚条约组织所进行的活动使东南亚的局势日益紧张的时候，美国军事顾问团在南越的存在和活动是对东南亚地区的和平和安宁的威胁。
    信里说，何文楼大校在去年1月7日的信中曾经指出，南越当局在1955年2月同意让美国直接掌握南越的建军工作，并且使美国军事顾问团负起组织和训练南越军队的任务。信中说，几年来美帝国主义通过美国军事顾问团把成千名军事顾问和人员、成万吨武器和战争物资运入南越，在南越建设飞机场、军港、仓库、战略公路等军用工程，以加强南越的军事力量。美国军事顾问团里的军官还直接参与和指挥南越军队的“扫荡”，来迫害、残杀和逮捕南越人民。最近还有两名美国将领被派到美国军事顾问团。
    何文楼在信里指出，在签订日内瓦协议之后，美国、法国和保大政权在1950年12月23日签订的“关于印度支那共同防御援助协定”已经完全丧失效力。因此，由上述协定所产生的美国军事顾问团也就不能继续存在，它的顾问和军事人员必须撤离南越。同时，上述“关于印度支那共同防御援助协定”和1955年2月关于在南越成立美国军事顾问团的协议都必须取消。
