The Second National People's Congress, at its first session, thoroughly discussed all aspects of the question of Tibet and resolved as follows:

(1) The Congress fully agrees with the various measures taken by the State Council regarding the rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique on March 10, 1959. The Congress expresses its respect and solicitude to the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet for their swift suppression of the rebellion, and to the people of all strata and patriotic figures from all sectors of Tibetan society for their active assistance to the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the rebellion.

(2) The rebellion by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique was not accidental. Ever since British imperialism used India as a base to carry out military, political, and economic aggression against our country's Tibetan region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a long and acute struggle has unfolded between the patriotic Tibetan people who resisted aggression and the handful of Tibetan traitors who were bought and used by foreign aggressive forces. On the eve of China's liberation, pro-imperialist elements dominated the leading group of the former Tibetan local government. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, the Central People's Government, in order to wait for these pro-imperialist elements to awaken, adopted a lenient attitude towards them, allowing them to continue to hold positions in the former local government, provided that they severed ties with imperialism and other foreign interventionists and ceased engaging in sabotage activities, their past would not be investigated. This policy of the Central People's Government was completely correct, because it was conducive to the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army establishing contact with the broad masses of the Tibetan people and many upper and middle-level figures, and gaining their trust. However, the traitors in the former Tibetan local government paid lip service to the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, continued to collude with imperialists and foreign interventionists, plotted to realize the so-called "Tibetan independence" demanded by imperialists and foreign interventionists, and launched an armed rebellion. Only after the rebels launched an attack on the People's Liberation Army garrison in Lhasa did the Central People's Government order the People's Liberation Army to suppress the rebellion and order the dissolution of the former Tibetan local government. This completely exposed the crimes of these traitors before the people of all strata in Tibet and before the people of the world. All reasons are entirely on the side of the Central People's Government and all those who support the Central People's Government's policy. Any foreigners who express "sympathy" for this group of rebels who betray the motherland, split the motherland, break their promises, commit murder and arson, and exterminate humanity, and attempt to use this opportunity to interfere in China's internal affairs, can only allow the people of all nationalities in China and the people of all countries in the world to recognize their true colors, thereby gaining the necessary lessons.

(3) In Tibet, as in other minority nationality areas, ethnic regional autonomy under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government should be resolutely implemented. The former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique vainly attempted to achieve so-called "Tibetan independence," and therefore actively opposed ethnic regional autonomy. Now, with the dissolution of the former Tibetan local government and the failure of the rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, it has become possible, while implementing military control by the People's Liberation Army, to gradually establish local administrative organs at all levels in the Tibet Autonomous Region and the self-defense armed forces of the Tibetan people under the leadership of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and to begin exercising autonomous powers. The local administrative organs at all levels in the Tibet Autonomous Region should have representatives of the broad masses of the people and representatives of patriotic figures from all strata participating. All officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army troops in Tibet, and all Han and other ethnic workers working in Tibet, must establish the closest fraternal relationship with the Tibetan people, work hard, and struggle heroically to serve the interests of the Tibetan people.

(4) The current social system in Tibet is an extremely backward serf system. The degree of exploitation, oppression, and cruelty inflicted by serf owners on the working people is rare in the world. Even those who verbally express "sympathy" for the Tibetan rebels cannot explain why they are so keen to support this backward system. The Tibetan people have long firmly demanded the reform of their social system, and many enlightened upper and middle-level figures also recognize that without reform, the Tibetan nation has no possibility of prosperity and strength. Because the rebellion of the reactionary elements of the former Tibetan local government, who opposed reform, has been quelled, the reform demands of the broad masses of the Tibetan people have obtained the conditions for smooth realization. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region should, in accordance with the Constitution, the wishes of the broad masses of the Tibetan people, and the characteristics of Tibetan society, economy, and culture, gradually realize the democratic reform of Tibet, extricate the Tibetan people from their suffering, so as to lay the foundation for building a prosperous and strong socialist new Tibet. In the process of reform, the patriotic monks and laypeople of all strata in Tibet should be closely united, different treatment should be given to the serf owners who did not participate in the rebellion, those who were coerced into participating in the rebellion but quickly surrendered, and those who resolutely participated in the rebellion. Attention should be paid to protecting the freedom of religious belief and religious cultural relics of all the people in Tibet.

(5) Tibet is an inseparable part of China. Tibet is the Tibet of the Chinese people's big family, the Tibet of the broad masses of the Tibetan people, not the Tibet of a few reactionary elements, and even less the Tibet of imperialists and foreign interventionists. The rebellion of a few reactionary elements in Tibet and the suppression of the rebellion are entirely China's internal affairs, and no foreign interference is allowed. In the Tibetan region, thoroughly implementing ethnic regional autonomy under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, with the broad masses of the people and patriotic figures from all walks of life running the affairs of their own region, thoroughly implementing democratic reform under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, and relying on the brotherly unity and mutual assistance of the working people of all nationalities to build a prosperous and strong socialist new Tibet is the unwavering policy of the People's Republic of China. The rebellion of a few reactionary elements in Tibet cannot only not prevent the realization of this policy, but can only accelerate the awakening of the Tibetan people, thereby accelerating the realization of this policy. Similarly, any foreign force interfering in this policy of our country in Tibet in any name or in any form cannot prevent the realization of this policy, but can only arouse the patriotic struggle of the people of all nationalities in our country, including the Tibetan people, against interference. The People's Republic of China has always adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, living in peace with its southwestern neighbors, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of these countries, and not interfering in the internal affairs of these countries. The National People's Congress regrets to note that extremely unfriendly words and deeds interfering in China's internal affairs have recently appeared among certain political figures in India. Such words and deeds are not in the common interest of the two peoples, but only in the interest of the common enemy of the two peoples, imperialism. The Congress hopes that this abnormal phenomenon will be quickly eliminated, and that the great and long-standing friendly relations between China and India will be further consolidated and developed through the joint efforts of both sides.

    中华人民共和国第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议
    关于西藏问题的决议
    一九五九年四月二十八日第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过
    第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议详细地讨论了有关西藏的各方面问题，决议如下：
    （一）会议完全同意国务院对于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团在一九五九年三月十日举行叛乱后所采取的各项措施。会议对迅速平定叛乱的中国人民解放军驻西藏部队表示敬意和慰问，对积极协助解放军平定叛乱的西藏僧俗各界人民和各阶层爱国人士表示敬意和慰问。
    （二）原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的叛乱不是偶然的。自英帝国主义在十九世纪末、二十世纪初以印度为基地对我国西藏地方实行军事、政治和经济的侵略以来，反侵略的西藏爱国人民同被外国侵略势力所收买利用的少数西藏卖国贼之间，就展开了长期的尖锐的斗争，而在中国解放前夜，亲帝国主义分子在原西藏地方政府的领导集团中是占着优势的。一九五一年西藏和平解放以后，中央人民政府为了等待这批亲帝国主义分子的觉悟，对他们采取了宽大的态度，让他们在原地方政府继续供职，只要他们割断同帝国主义和其他外国干涉者的联系，不再进行破坏活动，就不究既往。中央人民政府的这个政策是完全正确的，因为这有利于中央人民政府和人民解放军同西藏广大人民以及很多上中层人士建立联系，并且获得他们的信任。但是，原西藏地方政府中的卖国贼对于和平解放西藏的十七条协议阳奉阴违，继续同帝国主义者和外国干涉者勾结，阴谋实现帝国主义和外国干涉者所要求的所谓“西藏独立”，并且发动武装叛乱。中央人民政府直至叛匪向拉萨人民解放军驻军发动进攻以后，才命令人民解放军讨平叛乱，才命令解散原西藏地方政府。这就使得这些卖国贼的罪恶完全暴露在西藏各阶层人民之前，暴露在全世界人民之前。一切理由完全在中央人民政府和一切拥护中央人民政府方针的人们方面。任何对于这批出卖祖国、分裂祖国、背信弃义、杀人放火、灭绝人性的叛匪表示“同情”和企图借机干涉中国内政的外国人，只能使中国各族人民和世界各国人民认清他们的面目，从而获得必要的教训。
    （三）在西藏，同在其他少数民族地区一样，应当坚决实现中央人民政府统一领导下的民族区域自治。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团妄想实现所谓“西藏独立”，因而积极反对民族区域自治，现在随着原西藏地方政府的解散和西藏上层反动集团叛乱的失败，已经有可能在实行人民解放军军事管制的同时，在西藏自治区筹备委员会领导之下，逐步建立西藏自治区的各级地方行政机构和藏族人民的自卫武装，并且开始执行自治职权。西藏自治区的各级地方行政机构，都应当有广大人民的代表和各阶层爱国人士的代表参加。在西藏的人民解放军部队全体官兵，一切在西藏工作的汉族和其他民族的工作人员，都必须同藏族人民建立最亲密的兄弟关系，艰苦工作，英勇奋斗，为藏族人民的利益服务。
    （四）西藏现在的社会制度是一种极其落后的农奴制度，农奴主对于劳动人民的剥削、压迫、残害的惨酷程度是世界上少有的，甚至那些口口声声“同情”西藏叛匪的人，也说不出他们为什么硬要热心于支持这种落后制度的理由。西藏人民久已坚决要求改革自己的社会制度，许多上中层开明人士也认识到，如不改革，西藏民族断无繁荣昌盛的可能。由于反对改革的原西藏地方政府反动分子的叛乱已经平定，西藏广大人民的改革要求，已经得到顺利实现的条件。西藏自治区筹备委员会应当根据宪法，根据西藏广大人民的愿望和西藏社会经济文化的特点，逐步实现西藏的民主改革，出西藏人民于水火，以便为建设繁荣昌盛的社会主义的新西藏奠定基础。在改革过程中，应当密切团结全西藏各阶层的爱国僧俗人民，区别对待未参加叛乱的、被裹胁参加叛乱而迅速投诚的和坚决参加叛乱的农奴主，注意保护全西藏人民的宗教信仰自由和宗教文物古迹。
    （五）西藏是中国的不可分割的一部分。西藏是中国人民大家庭的西藏，是西藏广大人民的西藏，而不是少数反动分子的西藏，更不是帝国主义者和外国干涉者的西藏。西藏少数反动分子的叛乱和对于叛乱的平定，完全是中国的内政，不容许任何外国人干涉。在西藏地区，贯彻地实行在中央人民政府统一领导下的、由广大人民和各界爱国人士当家作主的民族区域自治，贯彻地实行在中央人民政府统一领导下的民主改革，并且依靠各族劳动人民兄弟般的团结和互助，建设繁荣昌盛的社会主义新西藏，这是中华人民共和国的坚定不移的方针。西藏少数反动分子的叛乱，不但不能阻止这个方针的实现，而且只能加速西藏人民的觉悟，从而加速这个方针的实现。同样，任何外国势力以任何名义任何形式对于我国在西藏的这个方针进行干涉，也不能阻止这个方针的实现，只能激起包括西藏人民在内的我国各族人民的反对干涉的爱国斗争。中华人民共和国一贯遵守五项原则，同西南各邻国和平共处，尊重这些国家的主权和领土完整，不干涉这些国家的内政。全国人民代表大会遗憾地注意到，最近在印度某些政界人士中出现了极不友好的干涉中国内政的言行。这种言行不符合于两国人民的共同利益，而只符合于两国人民的共同敌人帝国主义的利益。会议希望，这种不正常的现象将迅速消除，中印两国之间的伟大的悠久的友好关系将通过双方的共同努力，得到进一步的巩固和发展。
