The upper-level rebel group in Tibet, formerly fostered by British imperialism, has consistently colluded with imperialism, foreign reactionaries, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. They have secretly engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, splitting the unity of the motherland, undermining national unity, and妄想eternally maintaining their dark system of great serf owners, consigning the Tibetan people to an irredeemable hell on earth. This handful of rebellious elements is actually a disgrace to the nation, a Rakshasa in Buddhism!

Their audacity in openly launching this rebellion is primarily due to the instigation of foreign imperialists. They mistook the central government's hope for their awakening as weakness and vulnerability, and even kidnapped the Dalai Lama to enhance their importance, wrongly underestimating the power of the people and the strength of the People's Liberation Army. As a result, they are heading down the path of self-destruction. Under the iron fists of our invincible People's Liberation Army and the patriotic Tibetan people, these gangs of traitors who inflict cruelty on the people have been swiftly quelled, ending the dark rule of Tibet and leading the Tibetan people towards a new life. We recognize that only on the basis of consolidating the unity of the motherland and national unity can Buddhism flourish even more and faith be truly free.

The so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama" merely repeats the platitudes of Indian expansionists clamoring about our suppression of the Tibetan rebellion. To discerning eyes, it is clear that this is the voice of a "fake Dalai," and it is distinctly different from the voice of the true Dalai Lama who sent three letters to General Tan Guansan, clearly distinguishing between the demonic and the Buddhist. The appearance of the voice of the demon has further alarmed the hearts of many kind people in the world, while American and British imperialists rejoice and applaud. However, in the eyes of discerning people, the demonic appearance cannot hide the true face of the demon. Correct public opinion at home and abroad unanimously points out who is behind this statement, as clear as seeing an apple in the palm of one's hand. When Indian Prime Minister Nehru's remarks confirmed that the several letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan were genuine, in that instant, like an avalanche from a high mountain, the original form of the imperialists and Indian expansionists' instigation of the Tibetan rebellion was exposed, and the excuses for slandering our suppression of the Tibetan rebellion and the Dalai Lama's arrival in India "being of his own free will and not being kidnapped" were shattered like soap bubbles.

The swift suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is originally an exercise of sovereignty by our country on its own territory. Why does it provoke such clamoring from some people in our friendly neighbor India, not only revealing inner "sympathy" for a handful of traitors who have committed heinous crimes in our Tibet, but also resurrecting the "magic weapon" of "Tibetan independence," the stinky dung pile used by the old-brand colonialist Britain when it invaded our Tibet in the past, to interfere in our internal affairs? The reason is simple. Driven by greed, these Indian expansionists are dizzy and disoriented, wanting to split Tibet, which has been an inseparable and sacred territory of China since ancient times, from China to be their colony or protectorate. Now, we solemnly warn you: Wake up your minds! Today's China will no longer be bullied or manipulated. To dream of splitting Tibet from China is even more difficult than shaking Mount Sumeru.

We are Buddhist workers, and under the leadership of Honorary President Panchen and President Xirao Gyatso, we are doing the work of protecting the Three Jewels, assisting in propagating the Dharma, and assisting the government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief. We hold the neighboring country of India in the highest respect, and our love for our own motherland is of course more important than our own lives. The friendship between China and India and the spread of Buddhist culture are major factors in it. Based on this historical tradition, it has developed into a shining example of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between nations today, which is specifically embodied in the agreement between the Chinese Tibet region and the Indian government. How should the people of China and India cherish the thousands of years of traditional virtue of Sino-Indian friendship? Only the demon of imperialism constantly attempts to undermine the feelings of the people of China and India so that they can profit from it. China will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and at the same time, it will never allow any foreigners to interfere in China's internal affairs. If China and India can adhere to this cornerstone of peaceful policy, they will be able to make greater contributions to promoting peace in Asia and the world. In the past few days, Indian expansionists have more blatantly clamored to interfere in China's internal affairs, and have also incited some people to come out and hold anti-China parades. In individual places, there have even been instances of insulting the image of our supreme leader Chairman Mao under the connivance of the police, and individual reactionary newspapers have even cursed our Buddhist leader, the Panchen Lama, as a "lackey." Buddhism teaches forbearance and self-restraint, but when demons are too rampant, they will also pick up the vajra to subdue demons and fight together with peace-loving people at home and abroad against demons who want to dig out the cornerstone of peace in the world. Since ancient times, demons and Buddhas have been incompatible, and light and darkness cannot coexist. This is the truth taught to us by Shakyamuni Buddha.

    魔鬼岂能摇动须弥山
    西藏上层叛乱集团，过去受英帝国主义豢养，在和平解放西藏后，一贯勾结帝国主义、国外反动派与蒋介石匪帮，暗中进行反革命活动，分裂祖国统一，破坏民族团结，妄想永远维持它们的大农奴主的黑暗制度、置西藏人民于万劫不复的人间地狱生活。它们这一撮叛乱分子，实际是民族的败类，佛教中的罗刹！
    它们这次胆敢公开地进行叛乱，首先是受国外帝国主义者的策动，把中央政府等待它们的觉悟心情反认为软弱可欺，还劫持了达赖喇嘛以自重，错误地估低了人民的力量与解放军的力量。结果呢，是它们自己走向灭亡的道路。在我战无不胜的解放军与爱国西藏人民的力量的铁拳头下，迅速地平定了这些残民以逞的叛国叛教的乌合之众，结束了西藏黑暗的统治，使西藏人民走向新生。我们认识到只有在巩固祖国统一、民族团结的基础上，才能使佛教更会昌隆，信仰得到真正的自由。
    所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”不过反复了印度扩张主义分子对我平定西藏叛乱叫嚣的滥调，在明眼人前一望就知道这是“假达赖”的声音，它与给谭冠三将军三封信的真达赖喇嘛声音显然有魔佛之分。由于魔鬼的声音出现，更惊扰了世界许多善良人们的心，美英帝国主义者则高兴喝采。可是在明眼人的面前，魔相毕竟掩不住魔的真面目，国内外的正确舆论，一致指出这个声明的背后是谁的面目，真象手掌中看苹果一样。到了印度尼赫鲁总理的谈话证实了达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军几封信是真的时候，这一刹那间，似高山的雪崩一样，顿使帝国主义与印度扩张主义分子策动西藏叛乱的原形毕现，诬蔑我平定西藏叛乱和达赖喇嘛到印度“是出于自己的自由意志而不是被劫持”的借口，像肥皂泡一样破灭了。
    迅速平定西藏叛乱，这原是我国在自己领土上行使主权，为什么会惹起我们友好邻国印度一些人中这样那样地叫嚣不已、对我国西藏罪大恶极的一撮叛国分子不只是流露出内心的“同情”，还祭起了老牌殖民主义者英国过去侵略我国西藏时所用过的“西藏独立”的臭矢橛的“法宝”来干涉我国的内政呢？原因很简单，由于他们这一撮印度扩张主义分子被贪婪心所驱使，晕头转向地想把自古以来即是中国神圣领土不可分割的西藏分裂出去作为他们的殖民地或保护国。现在，我们严正地警告你们：醒醒你们的头脑吧！今天的中国再也不会受人欺侮和任人摆布了，痴心妄想要把西藏从中国分裂出去，真是要比摇动须弥山还难。
    我们是佛教工作者，我们在班禅名誉会长和喜饶嘉错会长领导之下，做护持三宝、辅弘法化、协助政府贯彻宗教信仰自由政策的工作，对印度邻邦，抱着极崇高的敬仰心情，对自己祖国的热爱当然比自己的生命还更重要。中印两国的友谊，佛教文化的传播是具有重大因素之一，基于这种历史传统的因素上发展为今天国家与国家间的新的和平共处五项原则的光辉范例，它正是具体地创始体现在中国西藏地方与印度政府协定之中。中印两国人民应如何地珍惜中印友好数千年的传统美德，只有帝国主义这个魔鬼才时时刻刻地企图破坏中印两国人民的感情，它们才能从中取利。中国是绝不会干涉别国的内政，同时也绝不容许任何外国人干涉中国的内政。中印两国如能坚持这个和平政策的基石，将更能推动亚洲和全世界和平事业作出更大的贡献。几天来印度扩张主义分子更露骨地叫嚣要干涉中国内政，还鼓动一些群众出来举行反对中国的游行，在个别地方还出现了在警察纵容群众之下侮辱我国最高领袖毛主席的像，个别反动的报纸还漫骂我们佛教领袖班禅大师为“走卒”。佛教是讲安忍，克制自己的，可是到了魔鬼过于嚣张的时候，也会拿起金刚降魔杵与国内外爱好和平的人民共同对想挖掉全世界和平基石的魔鬼做斗争的。自来魔与佛是不两立的，光明与黑暗是不会同在的，这是释迦牟尼佛陀教导我们的真理。
