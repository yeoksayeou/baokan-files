Professional Aviation Shows Great Skill
Spring Tasks Successfully Completed, Comprehensive Activities About to Begin

(Our report) In order to support a greater leap forward in agricultural production, this year China's industrial aviation flying hours will increase by 26.6% compared to last year, and agricultural aviation flying hours will increase by 96.2% compared to last year, including a 15.8% increase in aerial photography, a 39.5% increase in aerial magnetic surveys, and a 47.8% increase in aerial physical prospecting. Currently, various professional aviation bases are actively preparing for the comprehensive activities that are about to begin.

In the first quarter of this year, civil aviation professional aircraft have successfully sown tree seeds in Xinjiang, controlled wheat rust in Shaanxi, and conducted artificial rainfall experiments in Sichuan. Starting in May this year, Xinxiang, Henan, will pilot comprehensive operations for cotton fields using aircraft, including the prevention and control of early and late-stage cotton pests, fertilization, and cotton defoliation. This year, field chemical weeding experiments will also be conducted in some areas using aircraft.

Civil aviation surveying aircraft recently conducted large-scale aerial photography for urban planning departments, with excellent results. In order to overcome the impact of adverse weather on aerial photography, infrared film will also be used this year for low-visibility photography experiments.

China's professional aviation industry is developing rapidly year by year. Last year, the workload of professional aviation increased by 76.6% compared to 1957. Aircraft equipped with various prospecting instruments frequently appeared over the Greater Khingan Range, circled north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, and were also active along the Dongting Lake and the Qiantang River. Thanks to the close cooperation between civil aviation employees and geological exploration personnel, 57 mineral deposits were discovered in the third quarter of last year alone, and 18 of them have been verified to have mining value. In terms of aerial surveying, photography work covering hundreds of thousands of square kilometers, including sixteen provinces and cities, was completed, supporting key construction projects such as the Baotou Iron and Steel Base and the Great Northern Wilderness reclamation area, and collaborating with the Ministry of Railways to conduct aerial route selection work. Topographic data was provided for 21 railways to be built in twelve provinces (autonomous regions) including Yunnan, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia.

Last year, professional aviation also added many new operations, including aerial seeding and scientific experiments using aircraft for artificial rainfall. In Yulin, Shaanxi, and Gansu, etc., aircraft seeded more than 700,000 mu of desert, hills, or high mountain areas with sand sagebrush, spruce, and oil pine, and generally sprouted and emerged about ten days after sowing, with a survival rate of over 80%.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest of grain and cotton, professional aviation has also made significant contributions in the prevention and control of crop diseases and insect pests. For example, when locust plagues occurred in Baoding and other parts of Hebei Province last year, locusts were eradicated on more than 600,000 mu of farmland within six days by using aircraft to control them. In Gaotang County, Shandong Province, aircraft were used to control pests on 300,000 mu of cotton fields, and the average yield of cotton fields treated by aircraft increased by about 40% compared to untreated cotton fields.

　　专业航空大显身手
    春季任务胜利完成　全面活动即将展开
    本报讯　为了支援农业生产更大的跃进，今年我国工业航空飞行小时将比去年增长26.6％，农业航空飞行小时比去年增长96.2％，其中航空摄影增长15.8％，航空磁测增长39.5％，航空物理探矿增长47.8％。现在各专业航空基地正在积极准备，即将开始全面活动。
    今年第一季度，民航专业飞机在新疆撒播树种，在陕西除治小麦锈病，在四川进行人工降雨的试验，都已得到成功。今年5月开始，河南新乡将试用飞机进行棉田综合作业，包括防治前后期棉虫、施肥和棉花落叶。今年还将在部分地区用飞机进行田间化学除草试验。
    民航测量飞机最近为城市规划部门进行大比例尺的空中摄影，效果很好。为了克服不良天气对航空摄影的影响，今年还将用红外线胶片进行低能见度的摄影试验。
    我国专业航空事业正在逐年迅速地发展着。去年，专业航空的工作量就比1957年增加了76.6％。装置着各种探矿仪器的飞机，经常出现在兴安岭的上空，盘旋在天山南北，也活跃在洞庭湖边和钱塘江两岸。由于民航职工和地质勘探人员的密切合作，去年第三季度就发现了五十七处矿藏，已经复查证实有开采价值的就有十八处。在航空测量方面，完成了包括十六个省市的数十万平方公里的摄影工作，支援了包头钢铁基地和北大荒垦区等重点建设，并和铁道部协作，进行航空选线工作。在云南、甘肃、新疆、内蒙古等十二个省（区），为即将兴建的二十一条铁路提供地形资料。
    去年，专业航空还增添了不少新的作业，其中包括航空播种和使用飞机进行人工降雨的科学试验。在陕西榆林和甘肃等地，飞机在七十多万亩沙漠、丘陵或高山地带播种的沙蒿，云杉和油松等植物，一般在播种后十天左右即发芽抽苗，成活率达到80％以上。
    为了确保粮棉大丰收，在防治农作物病虫害方面，专业航空也作出不少的贡献。如去年河北省保定等部分地区发生蝗灾，由于采用飞机灭蝗，六天内就在六十多万亩的农田上扑灭了蝗虫。在山东省高唐县，用飞机进行三十万亩棉田的治虫工作，经过飞机治虫的棉田比没有防治的棉田平均增产约40％。
