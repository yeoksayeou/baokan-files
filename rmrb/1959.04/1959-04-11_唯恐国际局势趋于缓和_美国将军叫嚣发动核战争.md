Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th -- Washington News: The United States recently published the testimonies of some Pentagon military generals at secret Congressional meetings not long ago. These testimonies threaten to launch a nuclear war. It is believed that the publication of these warmongering cries is intended to undermine the upcoming East-West talks, thereby hindering the easing of the international situation.

U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining confirmed in their testimonies that the United States is currently working day and night to plan "various actions other than major wars" to use the Berlin issue for military provocations. They also threatened that the United States would not hesitate to drag its Western European allies into a devastating nuclear war.

McElroy and Twining echoed each other. McElroy shamelessly said that if the ground forces of the United States' allies are included, the United States' military power is sufficient to deal with small-scale and large-scale wars. Twining further added that if a war were to occur, it would be a "missile war." He said: "The entire strategy and policy of the United States is not to wage a limited war with the Russians in Europe. We wouldn't even say that." He also clamored that the "counter-attack spear" of the North Atlantic Group was "ready."

McElroy also boasted about the power of launching missiles from submarines, describing it as a "deterrent force" that is "becoming increasingly large."

U.S. Strategic Air Command Commander Power advocated that the United States should step up the development of heavy bombers and intercontinental missiles. He even advocated that nuclear weapons should also be used in certain types of small-scale wars.

　　唯恐国际局势趋于缓和
　　美国将军叫嚣发动核战争
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国最近发表了五角大楼的一些军事将领不久以前在国会秘密会议上的证词，这些证词威胁要发动核战争。人们认为，发表这些好战叫嚣是为了破坏即将举行的东西方会谈，从而阻挠国际局势的趋于缓和。
    美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊和参谋长联席会议主席特文宁在证词中证实，目前美国正在夜以继日地策划采取“除了大战以外的其他各种行动”，利用柏林问题来进行军事挑衅。他们还恫吓说，美国甚至不惜把它的西欧盟国拖入一场毁灭性的核战争之中。
    麦克耳罗伊和特文宁一呼一应，麦克耳罗伊大言不惭地说，如果把美国盟国的地面部队计算在内，美国的军事力量足以应付小规模和大规模战争。特文宁则进一步补充说，如果要发生战争，那就是“导弹战争”。他说：“美国的整个战略和政策不是在欧洲同俄国人进行有限的战争，我们连说都不会这样说。”他还叫嚣说，北大西洋集团的“反攻的矛”已经“准备好了”。
    麦克耳罗伊又吹嘘从潜水艇上发射导弹的威力，把它描绘成“具有越来越大”的“遏止力量”。
    美国战略空军司令鲍威尔鼓吹美国应加紧发展重轰炸机和洲际导弹。他甚至主张，在某些类型的小规模战争中，也应该使用核武器。
