　　Single-Mindedly Devoted to Refining Steel Well
　　By Our Reporter Yu Feng
    “The Yellow River water is a thousand zhang deep, but it cannot match the affection of Ma Steel sending iron.” This is a poem by Shanghai steel factory workers thanking Ma'anshan Iron and Steel workers for supporting them with pig iron.
    During my trip, I often saw thousands of tons of pig iron piled up in Bengbu, Hefei, and other places along the Huainan Railway; after one batch was shipped away, newly produced iron was again concentrated at the station from various iron and steel plants. At the dock in Wuhu Port, pig iron was also piled up waiting to be shipped east by轮. This marks that since the mass campaign for steel last year, the friendship between Shanghai and Ma'anshan has expanded to various iron and steel bases in Anhui. Last year, Anhui transferred more than 340,000 tons of pig iron to Shanghai, and in the first quarter of this year, Anhui shipped more than two-thirds of its pig iron production, a total of more than 250,000 tons, to support key enterprises in Shanghai and other places. This figure is equivalent to 59.3% of the total iron transferred last year. After visiting some iron and steel plant leaders and workers in these new iron and steel bases, I deeply felt how deeply rooted the phrase "support Shanghai with pig iron" is in people's hearts!
    Not long ago, when I arrived at the steel plant of the Provincial Party Committee, the No. 3 furnace had just finished tapping iron. A young furnace worker skillfully used iron tongs to pick out a small piece of red-hot iron from the sand mold, put it on an iron shovel, and walked out with it. "He is sending the iron for testing," Yue Rongju, the deputy director of the first workshop, said to me. Here, there are fixed personnel on each shift responsible for sending samples, and they take the initiative to send the samples as soon as the iron comes out of the furnace. Why don't the workers mind the trouble? A small blast furnace with a volume of 13 cubic meters taps iron every hour and a half, and every furnace of iron has to be sent for testing. What are they thinking? Li Wenqi, a young blast furnace worker who had just left the countryside half a year ago, answered my question. He pointed to the iron pry bar in his hand and said, "Look at this pry bar, it's not made of good steel. It bends when you hit it while opening the tap. If the pry bar were made of good steel, it would be faster and easier to open the tap. Tools need to be made of good steel, but without good iron, how can you make good steel?" Then he said proudly, "Our iron is sent to Shanghai to make steel and support the whole country. We guarantee it will be useful!..."
    From Hefei Railway Station, walking west along the railway for half a li, you arrive at the Hefei City Pig Iron Transfer Station. When I arrived here, the freight yards along the railway line were already filled with more than 700 tons of pig iron. People were busy unloading iron, carrying iron, weighing iron...
    Zhu Ruyu, the section chief of the Pig Iron Transfer Station, introduced the work of the transfer station to me: they are responsible for concentrating the pig iron from more than 30 iron smelting plants in Hefei City and uniformly transferring it out; they must constantly understand the iron storage situation of each plant and notify the transportation department to prepare vehicles; they are responsible for checking the quantity and quality of the iron... Here, I met Zhou Xiongcai and Ding Pinsong from the Shanghai Municipal Metallurgical Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Planning Commission. They were very satisfied with the work of the transfer station. They said that the Pig Iron Transfer Station is very serious about checking the quantity and quality of the pig iron transferred out. The iron from each plant is carefully checked and weighed before being sent to the freight yard. After every few shipments, the freight yard is cleaned up to collect the iron that was missed during loading at night, and then it is re-shipped to the other party.
    Once, I was visiting Han Xianghan, the director of the Hefei Municipal Planning Commission, when a comrade brought a report for him to approve. The report was written by the newly built Hefei City Rubber Factory. The report stated that they were short of some machines, and an electric wire factory in another province had agreed to help them process and manufacture them, and requested the Municipal Planning Commission to approve them to take six tons of iron for processing. After reading it, Director Han said, "The iron requested in this report is not within the number of iron allocated to our city for this month approved by the Provincial Planning Commission, so it cannot be approved." He turned to me and said, "In order to prevent some factories from taking pig iron out for processing on their own, a special regulation has been made: all those who take iron out of the city must have the approval of the Municipal Planning Commission, otherwise the transportation department will not provide transportation." This practice may cause inconvenience to some units; however, only in this way can we ensure that the whole country acts as a single entity and guarantee the key enterprises.

### 一心为了炼好钢

　　一心为了炼好钢
　　本报记者　于风
    “黄浦江水深千丈，不及马钢送铁情。”这是上海钢厂工人感谢马鞍山钢铁工人支援他们生铁的诗句。
    在我采访的旅途中，我经常看见淮南铁路沿线的蚌埠、合肥等地，堆积着成千吨的生铁；运走了一批，新出炉的铁又从各个钢铁厂集中到了车站。芜湖港口的码头上也堆着生铁待轮东发。这标志着，从去年大办钢铁以来，上海和马鞍山的友谊，已经扩大到安徽各个钢铁基地了。去年安徽调往上海的生铁达三十四万多吨，今年第一季度内，安徽把生产的生铁三分之二以上共二十五万多吨，都运出支援上海等地的重点企业，这个数字相当于去年全年调铁量的59.3％。在这些新的钢铁基地，访问了一些钢铁厂的负责人和工人以后，我深深地感到，“把生铁支援上海”这句话，是多么地深入人心！
    不久以前，我到省委机关钢铁厂时，三号炉刚出完铁水。一个青年炉前工，熟练地用铁钳从沙模里捡出一小块通红的铁，放在铁锹上拿着就往外走。“他是送铁去化验的”，第一车间副主任岳荣举对我说。这里，每班都有固定人员负责送样品，铁一出炉就主动把样品送走了。为什么工人们不嫌麻烦了呢？一个十三立方公尺的小洋高炉，每隔一个半钟头出一次铁，炉炉铁都要送去化验，他们是怎样想的？刚离开农村半年的青年高炉工人李文其回答了我的问题。他指着手里拿的铁钎对我说：“你看这根钎子，不是好钢做的，开铁口时一打就卷，要是好钢做的钎子，开起口来又快又省事。工具要好钢造，可是没有好铁，哪能炼出好钢来？”接着他很自豪地说：“我们的铁是送上海炼钢支援全国的，保他们管用！……”。
    从合肥火车站沿铁路往西，走半里地，就到了合肥市生铁转运站。我到这里时，沿铁路线的货位上已堆满了七百多吨生铁。人们在忙着卸铁、抬铁、过磅……。
    生铁转运站的朱如玉科长向我介绍了转运站的工作：他们负责集中合肥市三十多个炼铁厂的生铁，统一外调；要经常了解各个厂的存铁情况，通知运输部门准备车辆；负责检查铁的数量和质量……。在这里，我碰见了上海市冶金局、上海市计委的周雄才、丁品松等三位同志。他们很满意转运站的工作。他们说，生铁转运站对检查外调生铁的数量、质量都做得很认真，各个厂来的铁都经过仔细检查过磅后才送上货位，每运几次以后就要进行一次货位清扫工作，把晚上装货时遗漏的铁集中起来，再补运给对方。
    一次，我正在访问合肥市计委会的韩向寒主任，一位同志送来了一个报告请他批。这个报告是新建的合肥市橡胶厂写的。报告中说他们缺少一点机器，外省电线厂已同意帮助他们加工制造，请市计委批准他们带六吨铁去加工。韩主任看后说：“这个报告申请用的铁，不在省计委批准我市本月用铁的数目以内，不能批准”。他转过头来对我说：“为了防止有些厂自带生铁出外加工，特别作了一项规定：凡是带铁出市，一定要有市计委的批准书，不然交通部门不给运输。”这种作法，可能使某些单位感到不方便；但是，只有这样，才能保证全国一盘棋，保证重点企业。
