The headframe is the throat of the mine shaft. In the past, erecting shaft headframes involved using metal derrick booms, which were then dismantled. Workers at coal mines in Hebi, Jixi, and other places have developed experience in erecting shaft headframes without derrick booms, greatly accelerating the construction speed.

Two types of headframes were tested in the Erdaizi vertical shaft in Jixi: one involved using a temporary wooden headframe to erect the back brace, then using the back brace to erect the headframe body; the other involved using a temporary wooden headframe to erect the headframe body, then using the body to erect the back brace. The Yangjiazhuang Mine and Jiaochang Mine in Hebi directly used the back brace to erect the headframe. The advantages of this new construction method are: it shortens the construction period and the time the wellhead is occupied, saves steel, and saves equipment, tools, and labor. In the past, headframe erection and installation generally required about a thousand workdays; now, it only requires three hundred.

    不用抱杆起立井架
    井架是矿井的咽喉。过去竖井架都是用金属抱杆起立井架，然后再将抱杆拆除。鹤壁、鸡西等煤矿职工们，创造出不用抱杆起立井架的经验，大大加快了建设速度。
    鸡西二道河子竖井试用的井架有两种：一种是利用临时木井架起立后撑架，再利用后撑架起立井架躯体；一种是利用临时木井架起立井架躯体，然后利用躯体起立后撑架。鹤壁杨家庄矿、教场矿是直接用后撑架起立井架的。这种新的施工法的优点是：缩短了工期和占用井口的时间，节约了钢材，节约设备、工具和人工。过去井架起立和安装，一般需要一千个工左右，现在只需要三百个工。
