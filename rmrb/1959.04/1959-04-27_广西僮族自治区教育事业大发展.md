The quantity of schools at all levels and of all types has greatly increased, and the quality has also greatly improved. We deeply realize that education must be under the leadership of the Party to advance by leaps and bounds; to develop education, we must also follow the mass line.

Fellow Representatives:

We fully agree with and firmly support the "Government Work Report" made by Premier Zhou Enlai and the three reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Now let us talk about the development of education in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region over the past year.

In 1958, in the field of education, due to the implementation of the policy of serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor, Guangxi, like the rest of the country, set off a high tide of great leaps forward in education. The quantity of schools at all levels and of all types has greatly increased, and the quality has also greatly improved.

In terms of the quantity of educational development: The number of regional (i.e., provincial) universities has increased from three to eleven. The number of ordinary middle schools has increased from 330 to 2,492, with the number of students increasing from 160,812 to 372,179. The number of primary school students reached 2,975,566, accounting for 96 percent of the total number of school-age children. All 73 counties and cities in the region have basically universalized primary school education. In terms of literacy, more than 4 million illiterates have been eliminated, and 61 basically illiterate-free counties and cities and 3 basically illiterate-free special districts have emerged successively.

These achievements are mainly the result of implementing the Party's policy of "walking on two legs." For example, the number of students in ordinary middle schools in 1958 was 231.4 percent of that in 1957, of which those run by the education department increased to 123.25 percent of that in 1957; while those run by the people increased to 2,226.14 percent of that in 1957. The number of primary school students in 1958 was 132.56 percent of that in 1957, of which those run by the education department increased to 108.81 percent of that in 1957; while those run by the people increased to 922.3 percent of that in 1957.

Due to the great leap forward in production, the masses urgently needed culture, and coupled with the excellent tradition of running schools by the working people of Guangxi, under the guidance of the Party's correct policy, great achievements were made in the development of education in 1958.

With the development in quantity, the quality of education has also greatly improved.

Due to the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor, schools at all levels have established many factories and farms.

During the Great Steel Smelting Movement, teachers and students at all levels enthusiastically participated in the movement. After the Great Steel Smelting Movement, teachers and students enthusiastically participated in the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting rush work.

In productive labor, many schools have also combined scientific research and achieved many results, such as the comprehensive utilization of Masson pine by Liuzhou Forestry School, the comprehensive utilization of rice husks by Yulin High School, the preparation of drugs with good curative effects for treating high blood pressure from Rauwolfia verticillata by the Medical College, the development of analog electronic computers by the Normal College, and the creation of new varieties of distant hybridization of rice and sorghum by Jiang Shaofang of Yulin Normal School, and so on.

Through the practice of productive labor, the face of school education has been renewed. The phenomenon of being divorced from politics, divorced from production, and divorced from reality in the past has undergone a fundamental change. Teachers and students have greatly changed their views on labor and their feelings for the working people, and new relationships between teachers and students have begun to be established, teaching methods have been greatly improved, and the quality of learning has generally improved.

The great leap forward in education in Guangxi in 1958 made us deeply realize that education must be under the leadership of the Party to advance by leaps and bounds.

Education work must be done well with politics in command, and the policy of serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor must be earnestly implemented in order to achieve brilliant achievements.

In order to implement the Party's education policy, we must give full play to subjective initiative, conscientiously study the specific situation, and do our work in every possible way. All emphasis on condition theory and regional specificity is detrimental to the cause of socialist construction and is therefore wrong.

Guangxi is a multi-ethnic region, and the development of education is uneven. The educational foundation in some mountainous areas is relatively poor. However, due to the strengthening of the Party's leadership and the urgent need for culture among the masses, the great leap forward in 1958 enabled these areas to achieve brilliant results as well. For example, Bama, Du'an, Longsheng, Longlin, Sanjiang, and Da Miao Mountains, etc., have all become basically illiterate-free counties and have taken the lead in literacy work. Baise Special District, which originally had a relatively weak educational foundation, has gloriously become the first basically illiterate-free special district in the region and has taken the lead in setting off a high tide of running schools by factories.

The same is true in the popularization of primary school education. Some mountainous areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, such as Chongzuo, Tiandeng, Luocheng, Debao, Wuming, Pingguo, and Da Yao Mountains, etc., used to have relatively underdeveloped education, but now they have become advanced counties in the region for popularizing primary schools.

Secondly, to develop education, we must also follow the mass line.

In 1958, due to the implementation of the Party's policy of "walking on two legs," advocating running schools diligently and thriftily, combining work and study, and letting go of the masses to run schools, people-run primary and secondary schools sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, developing rapidly.

The enthusiasm of the masses for running schools is very high. They voluntarily contribute labor and materials, build school buildings, raise teaching aids, vacate houses, mobilize enrollment, teach voluntarily, and run schools by the whole people, forming a trend. The sound of books and laughter is overflowing everywhere.

The spare-time red and expert schools run by factories and communes have also developed greatly, with the number of students enrolled in the region reaching more than 2 million. The 148 factories in the Baise area alone have established 92 intermediate and junior spare-time technical schools, with more than 9,800 students enrolled.

Literacy work has also achieved great results due to the adoption of a mass movement. The mutual help among the masses in teaching is touching. Some couples teach each other, fathers and sons teach each other, deliver characters to the door, contract to teach and learn, forming a high tide of learning, as well as new human relationships and new atmospheres in the new society.

Even in the teaching work and scientific research work of universities, middle schools, and primary schools, certain achievements have been made due to the implementation of the mass movement. The closed-door, go-it-alone style has been broken, and a new style of communist cooperation has been formed.

In short, the achievements of Guangxi's education in 1958 were tremendous and exciting and encouraging.

We must, on the basis of the achievements already made in 1958, better sum up experience, improve our work, continue to deeply implement the policy of serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor, and vigorously run a number of key schools, using points to lead the whole area, and strive to continuously improve the teaching quality of our autonomous region.

We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party and on the premise of the urgent need for culture among the people of all ethnic groups, Guangxi's education will certainly be able to continue the great leap forward of 1958 and achieve even greater results.

Finally, I wish the conference a complete success!

I wish all the representatives good health!

    广西僮族自治区教育事业大发展
    石兆棠　赵乐群　莫乃群代表的联合发言各级各类学校在数量上大大发展了，在质量上大大提高了。我们深深体会到：教育必须在党的领导下，才能飞跃前进；发展教育事业，还必须走好群众路线。各位代表：
    我们完全同意并坚决拥护周恩来总理所作的“政府工作报告”和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的三个报告。
    现在让我们来谈谈广西僮族自治区一年来教育事业的发展情况。
    一九五八年，在教育事业方面，由于贯彻了教育为工人阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，广西也和全国一样，掀起了教育事业大跃进的高潮，各级各类学校在数量上大大发展了，在质量上也大大提高了。
    从教育事业发展的数量上说：区立（即省立）高等学校从三所发展为十一所。普通中学从三百三十所发展为二千四百九十二所，学生从十六万零八百一十二人发展为三十七万二千一百七十九人。小学在校学生达到二百九十七万五千五百六十六人，占学龄儿童总数百分之九十六，全区七十三个县市都已基本普及了小学教育。扫盲方面共扫除了四百多万文盲，先后出现了六十一个基本无盲县市，三个基本无盲专区。
    这些成绩的获得，主要是贯彻了党的“两条腿走路”的方针的结果。例如：普通中学的在校学生，一九五八年为一九五七年的百分之二百三十一点四，其中教育部门办的发展为一九五七年的百分之一百二十三点二五；而民办的发展为一九五七年的百分之二千二百二十六点一四。小学在校学生，一九五八年为一九五七年的百分之一百三十二点五六，其中教育部门办的发展为一九五七年的百分之一百○八点八一，而民办的发展为一九五七年的百分之九百二十二点三。
    由于生产大跃进，群众迫切需要文化，加上广西劳动人民又有办学的优良传统，在党的正确方针指导下，所以一九五八年在教育事业发展工作中取得了巨大的成绩。
    随着数量上的发展，教育质量上也大大提高。
    由于贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，各级学校举办了不少的工厂和农场。
    在大炼钢铁运动中，各级学校师生都踊跃地投入运动中去。在大炼钢铁运动后，师生们又踊跃地投入秋收、秋耕、秋种的农忙突击工作中去。
    在生产劳动中，许多学校还结合科学研究，也取得不少成绩，如柳州林校的综合利用马尾松、玉林高中的综合利用谷壳、医学院用萝芙木制成了治高血压疗效良好的药品、师范学院制成了模拟式电子计算机、玉林师范蒋少芳创造了水稻高粱远缘杂交新品种等等。
    通过生产劳动的实践，学校教育面貌为之一新。过去脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的现象有了根本的转变。师生们对劳动的看法，对劳动人民的情感有了很大的改观，而师生间的新关系也开始建立了，教学方法也大大改善了，学习质量也普遍提高了。
    从一九五八年广西教育事业的大跃进，使我们深深体会到：教育必须在党的领导下，才能飞跃前进。
    教育工作必须做好政治挂帅，切实贯彻教育为工人阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，才能获致辉煌成就。
    而为贯彻党的教育方针，必须充分发挥主观能动性，认真研究具体情况，千方百计地进行工作，一切强调条件论、地区特殊论，都是对于社会主义建设事业不利的，因而都是错误的。
    广西是多民族地区，教育发展是不平衡的，有些山区教育基础是比较差的，但是，由于加强了党的领导，在群众迫切需要文化的情况下，一九五八年的大跃进，使这些地区也同样取得辉煌的成绩。例如，巴马、都安、龙胜、隆林、三江、大苗山等县，都先后成为基本无盲县，在扫盲工作上都先走一步。而原来教育基础比较薄弱的百色专区，还光荣地成为全区第一个基本无盲专区，并且还带头首先掀起了工厂办学的高潮。
    在小学教育普及工作方面也一样，一些少数民族聚居的山区，如崇左、天等、罗城、德保、武鸣、平果、大瑶山等县，过去教育都是比较不发达的，现在都成为全区普及小学的先进县分。
    其次，发展教育事业，还必须走好群众路线。
    一九五八年由于贯彻了党的两条腿走路的方针，提倡勤俭办学、勤工俭学，放手群众办学，民办中小学便如雨后春笋，发展很快。
    群众办学的积极性是很高的，自动献工献料、兴建校舍，筹集教具，让出房屋，动员入学，义务任教，全民办学，蔚为风气，书声笑声，到处洋溢。
    至于工厂和公社办的业余红专学校也发展很大，全区入学人数达到二百多万。单百色地区的一百四十八个工厂，就办了九十二所中级和初级业余技术学校，入学达九千八百多人。
    扫盲工作由于采取大搞群众运动，也取得了巨大的成绩。群众在教学中，互相帮助的情况令人感动。有些夫妻互教、父子互教、送字上门、包教包学、形成了学习的高潮，也形成了新社会的人与人间的新关系，新风气。
    就是在高等学校、中小学校的教学工作和科学研究工作中，也由于贯彻了群众运动，取得了一定的成绩。打破了闭门造车的单干作风，形成了共产主义大协作的新风格。
    总之，一九五八年广西教育的成绩是巨大的、令人兴奋鼓舞的。
    我们必须在一九五八年的既得成绩的基础上，更好地总结经验、改进工作、继续深入贯彻教育为工人阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，并大力办好一批重点学校，以点带面，为不断提高我们自治区的教学质量而奋斗。
    我们深信在党的领导下，在各族人民的迫切需要文化的前提下，广西教育一定能够继续一九五八年的大跃进，取得更伟大的成绩。最后，谨祝大会胜利成功！
    各位代表身体健康！
