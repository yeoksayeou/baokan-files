A Salute to the Heroic Algerian People

To support the Algerian people's national liberation struggle, our people are launching "Algeria Week" starting today. Representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Army, who are currently on a friendly visit to our country, will spend these meaningful days with the Chinese people. During the solemn moment of "Algeria Week," our people will support the just struggle of the Algerian people for national independence with fervent hearts, and express our highest respect to the great Algerian people!

The Algerian people have taken up arms to resist French colonialism for more than four years. Initially, the Algerian National Liberation Army had only a small number of troops and inferior weapons and equipment, fighting against French colonial troops that were many times larger and better equipped. However, due to the justice of the war against colonialism and for national independence, and due to the united hatred of the nearly ten million Algerian patriotic people, the National Liberation Army has rapidly grown and become a powerful armed force of more than 100,000 people. The Algerian people's persistent armed struggle against the French colonialists not only lays the foundation for the final victory of their motherland's freedom and independence, but also has an immeasurable impact on the national liberation movements in Asia and Africa, especially on the African continent. The French imperialists' 600,000 colonial troops, more than two-thirds of its army, are pinned down in Algeria, consuming about 800 billion francs in war expenses each year, which cannot but seriously weaken the forces of imperialism and war. Therefore, the struggle of the heroic Algerian people has also made a great contribution to the sacred cause of the people of the world against imperialism and in defense of world peace.

The current situation shows that the balance of power in the Algerian war is shifting in favor of the Algerian people. Militarily speaking, the Algerian National Liberation Army is becoming stronger as it fights, its ranks are constantly expanding, its weapons and equipment have been greatly improved, and its morale is high. The recent fact that the Algerian National Liberation Army broke through the French colonial army's Maurice Line proves this point. On the contrary, for more than four years, the French colonial army has lost more than 100,000 men, and the losses have recently increased, with 104 killed and more than 100 wounded on March 18 alone. The French colonial army is stretched thin, exhausted, and completely at a disadvantage on the vast burning land of Algeria; at the same time, its sources of troops are gradually drying up, and its morale is extremely low. Politically speaking, the Algerian people are full of confidence and determined to carry the national liberation struggle to the end; while in France, the financial and economic situation is further deteriorating, the people's living standards are constantly declining, and anti-war sentiment is growing. The French "Express" weekly recently admitted that the colonial war France is waging in Algeria "has become unpopular," and the French people are generally "tired of the war." Since November 1954, the short lifespan of the French cabinets, with six cabinets collapsing one after another, has been directly related to the dirty colonial war they are waging in Algeria. The de Gaulle government is taking the road of dictatorship, suppressing the French people, and insisting on carrying out the colonial war in Algeria, and its future will certainly not be bright.

Today's international situation is greatly favorable to the Algerian people. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the powerful world peace forces are giving strong sympathy and support to the Algerian people's anti-colonialist struggle. Many Asian and African countries and Arab countries stand with the Algerian people. Especially in recent years, the national independence movements of the people of various African colonies have been surging, setting off a wave of anti-colonialist struggle. The colonial system in Africa is rapidly collapsing, and the French colonialists' colonies in West Africa are also suffering increasingly heavy blows and facing the prospect of disintegration. At the same time, North African countries such as Morocco and Tunisia are increasingly strengthening their solidarity with Algeria; Arab countries such as the Republic of Iraq, which has just been reborn, have decided to allocate two million pounds to aid Algeria, and to fully support the Algerian people's national independence struggle politically and morally. The unity between North African countries and Arab countries, built on the common foundation of anti-imperialism, safeguarding national independence, and the Bandung spirit, is undoubtedly an important guarantee for the Algerian people to win the victory in the anti-colonialist struggle.

Now, the French de Gaulle government continues to carry out bloody suppression in Algeria, while at the same time trying to use so-called "appeasement" policies and tricks such as "social reforms" to deceive and politically divide the Algerian people, attempting to incorporate Algeria into the French Community. De Gaulle and Debre are singing loudly that they will give the Algerian people "happiness" through some "social and economic development plan." However, the Algerian people, with more than a hundred years of experience in blood and tears under French colonial rule, deeply know that without true independence, there can be no social and economic development. And France's "development plan" only means that the French monopoly capitalist groups will more greedily plunder Algeria's natural resources, which will make the Algerian people's lives even more miserable and impoverished.

At the same time, people cannot but notice that American imperialism is also playing despicable conspiracies and tricks, trying to collude with the French colonialists to strangle the Algerian national liberation movement. There are reports that Washington is drafting a plan to resolve the Algerian issue similar to the Cyprus plan, so as to facilitate its intervention in Algeria and ultimately replace France. American imperialism has been helping the French colonial army massacre the Algerian people with weapons and dollars; not long ago, American monopoly capital entered the oil fields in the Sahara Desert, keen to plunder the rich resources belonging to the Algerian people. American imperialism is also trying its best to provoke unity among Arab countries, using the evil trick of Arabs fighting Arabs, trying to prevent the people of Arab countries from paying attention to the suppression and massacres by imperialism in Algeria, Oman, Aden, and other places, and from paying attention to the conspiracy to interfere in the Republic of Iraq; and instead attack Arab countries that are resolutely fighting against imperialism and safeguarding national independence. All this fully shows that American imperialism is the fierce enemy of Algeria and all the Arab people.

The Chinese people have deep sympathy for the national independence movements of the Algerian people and the people of all Arab countries. We firmly support the just struggle of the Algerian people. Like the Algerian people, the Chinese people have waged a long-term armed struggle against the imperialists. The Chinese people's experience proves that the seemingly powerful imperialists and all reactionary forces can be completely defeated under the situation of people's unity and perseverance in struggle. Therefore, we firmly believe that the heroic Algerian people will surely win the final and complete victory, and the banner of freedom and independence will surely be planted all over the glorious and splendid land of Algeria!

### 向英勇的阿尔及利亚人民致敬

    向英勇的阿尔及利亚人民致敬
    为了声援阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争，我国人民从今天开始举行“阿尔及利亚周”。正在我国进行友好访问的阿尔及利亚民族解放军的代表们，将同中国人民一起度过这些有意义的日子。在“阿尔及利亚周”的庄严的时刻里，我国人民将以火热的心情支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的正义斗争，并向伟大的阿尔及利亚人民表示崇高的敬意！
    阿尔及利亚人民拿起武器抗击法国殖民主义者，已经有四年多的时间了。最初，阿尔及利亚民族解放军仅有少量的兵力和劣势的武器装备，抗击着兵员数量大于自己许多倍的装备优良的法国殖民军。但是，由于反对殖民主义、争取民族独立战争的正义性，由于近一千万阿尔及利亚爱国人民的同仇敌忾，民族解放军迅速发展壮大，现在已经成为一支拥有十余万人的强大武装力量了。阿尔及利亚人民坚持反抗法国殖民者的武装斗争，不仅为自己祖国的自由和独立奠定了最后胜利的基础，并且对于亚非地区，特别是非洲大陆的民族解放运动发生着不可估量的影响。法帝国主义者的六十万殖民军，即它的三分之二以上的陆军部队受制于阿尔及利亚，每年消耗着八千亿左右法郎的战费，这不能不使帝国主义和战争势力遭到重大的削弱。因此，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的斗争，同时也对全世界人民的反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的神圣事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    目前的情况表明，阿尔及利亚战争双方的力量对比，正在向着有利于阿尔及利亚人民的方面转化中。从军事上说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军越战越强，队伍不断壮大，武器配备有了很大的改善，士气旺盛，斗志昂扬。最近阿尔及利亚民族解放军突破法国殖民军莫里斯防线的事实也证明了这一点。而相反，四年多来，法国殖民军的有生力量已被消灭达十万人以上，最近更有增无已，仅仅在3月18日一天就被打死一百零四人，杀伤一百多人。法国殖民军在燃烧着的阿尔及利亚广大土地上，顾此失彼，疲于奔命，完全处于不利的地位；同时，它的兵源日渐枯竭，士气极为低落。从政治上说，阿尔及利亚人民满怀信心，坚决把民族解放斗争进行到底；而法国国内，财政经济状况正进一步恶化，人民生活水平不断下降，反战厌战的心理更加发展。法国“快报”周刊最近也承认，法国在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争“已经变得不得人心”，法国人民普遍“厌倦战争”。从1954年11月以来，法国内阁寿命不长，六届内阁像走马灯一样一个接一个的垮台，都同它们在阿尔及利亚进行的肮脏的殖民战争有直接的关系。戴高乐政府走上独裁的道路，压制法国人民，坚持在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争，它的前途也决不会是美妙的。
    今天的国际形势已大大有利于阿尔及利亚人民。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和强大的世界和平力量正给予阿尔及利亚人民的反殖民主义斗争以有力的同情和支持。许多亚非国家和阿拉伯国家同阿尔及利亚人民站在一起。特别是近年以来，非洲殖民地各国人民民族独立运动风起云涌，掀起了反殖民主义斗争的怒潮。非洲的殖民制度正在迅速崩溃，法国殖民者在西非的殖民地同样遭受着越来越沉重的打击，面临土崩瓦解的前景。同时，摩洛哥、突尼斯等北非国家日益加强了它们同阿尔及利亚的团结；阿拉伯国家如伊拉克共和国刚刚获得新生，就决定拨款二百万英镑，援助阿尔及利亚，并且在政治上和道义上全力支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族独立斗争。北非国家和阿拉伯国家之间建筑在反对帝国主义、维护民族独立和万隆精神的共同基础上的团结，无疑是阿尔及利亚人民取得反殖民主义斗争胜利的一个重要的保证。
    现在，法国戴高乐政府一面继续在阿尔及利亚进行血腥镇压，一面竭力用所谓“绥靖”政策和什么“社会改革”等等的把戏对阿尔及利亚人民进行诱骗和政治分化，企图使阿尔及利亚并入法属共同体。戴高乐和德勃雷之流正在高唱他们将要通过什么“社会经济发展计划”给予阿尔及利亚人民以“幸福”。但是，阿尔及利亚人民在法国的殖民统治下积一百多年血和泪的经验，深知没有真正的独立，就不可能有社会经济的发展。而法国的“发展计划”只不过意味着法国垄断资本集团对阿尔及利亚天然资源的更加贪得无餍的掠夺，将使阿尔及利亚人民生活更加悲惨和贫困。
    与此同时，人们不能不注意到美帝国主义也正在玩弄卑劣的阴谋诡计，力图伙同法国殖民者扼杀阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动。有消息说，华盛顿方面正在拟订类似塞浦路斯方案的解决阿尔及利亚问题的计划，以便于它插足阿尔及利亚，最后取法国而代之。美帝国主义一直以武器和美元帮助法国殖民军屠杀阿尔及利亚人民；不久以前美国垄断资本又打入了撒哈拉大沙漠的油田，热中于掠夺属于阿尔及利亚人民的丰富的资源。美国帝国主义还在竭力进行着挑拨阿拉伯国家之间的团结，利用阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人的罪恶勾当，企图使阿拉伯各国人民不去注意帝国主义在阿尔及利亚、阿曼、亚丁等地的镇压和屠杀，不去注意对伊拉克共和国的干涉阴谋；而去攻击正在坚决为反对帝国主义和维护民族独立而斗争的阿拉伯国家。这一切充分表明，美国帝国主义是阿尔及利亚和全体阿拉伯人民的凶恶的敌人。
    中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民和阿拉伯各国人民的民族独立运动抱着深切的同情。我们坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争。和阿尔及利亚人民一样，中国人民曾经对帝国主义者进行过长期的武装斗争。中国人民的经验证明，貌似强大的帝国主义者和一切反动势力，在人民团结一致和坚持斗争的形势下，是完全可以被打败的。因此，我们深信，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民一定会获得最后的彻底的胜利，自由和独立的旗帜一定会插遍阿尔及利亚的光辉灿烂的大地！
