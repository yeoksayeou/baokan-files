　　"Lamb Mama"
　　In the Suji灘 People's Commune of the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, a group of lambs is particularly affectionate with the Tibetan female shepherdess Du Gashi. When Du Gashi approaches them, they surround her with jumps and hops as if they were children seeing their mother; when they see Du Gashi sitting down, they scramble onto her. Du Gashi also constantly strokes them with her hands, loving them as a mother loves her own children. Therefore, many people in the commune call Du Gashi "Lamb Mama."
　　Last winter, thousands of lambs were born in the Suji灘 People's Commune. Among them, 140 lambs were very weak due to the poor health or old age of their mothers, leaving them without milk. At this time, Du Gashi thought that the commune's 1959 leap forward plan required a lamb survival rate of 97.5%. If these lambs were not carefully raised, the task would be difficult to complete. Therefore, she actively suggested to the commune leaders that a lamb nursery be established. The work of the nursery would be undertaken by herself and three other female shepherdesses. The four of them used the medical technical knowledge they had learned in their spare-time middle school to carefully care for the 140 lambs that had no mother's milk to drink. They used soybeans and other raw materials to make artificial goat milk. When the lambs wouldn't eat it, they fed them with bottles and nipples. They also went up the mountain to fetch wood and build a row of lamb sheds, which were divided into several small bedrooms. These small bedrooms were cleaned every day, disinfected with lime, and padded with dry soil and dry manure at night. When the weather was good, they took the lambs out to play and bask in the sun. In order to take care of the lambs, Du Gashi and others even moved their bedding next to the lamb sheds to sleep. On winter nights, the Qinghai grasslands were especially cold, and she always braved the cold to get up and check on the lambs. Now, under their meticulous care, all 140 lambs are growing very strong.

　　Abu Le and the Ewe Flock
　　A flock of ewes grazed by Abu Le, a Tibetan commune member of the Yongyue People's Commune in Qilian County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, achieved a high yield record of 126.32% reproductive survival rate. Abu Le's flock of ewes consisted of 437 sheep. Last year, a total of 552 lambs survived, including 140 ewes that gave birth to two litters a year, producing a total of 280 lambs, all of which survived.
　　Abu Le is a well-known sheep herding expert in the local area. In order to make the ewes produce multiple litters, he takes meticulous care of the flock according to different seasons, water and grass conditions, and the physical condition of the ewes. In the summer and autumn when the grass is good, which is the season to gain weight, he tries his best to extend the grazing time. He takes them out of the pen as soon as it is light and does not return them until dark. When it is hot at noon, he pays attention to letting the ewes rest for two or three hours. In the winter and spring when the wind is strong and the weather is cold, and the pasture is withered and yellow, he often transfers the pasture, driving the sheep to graze in ditches and bends where there is more grass and shelter from the wind, so that the sheep can eat their fill and eat well. In order to enhance the physical fitness of the ewes as much as possible and prevent miscarriages, he also took various effective measures in different seasons. Therefore, the ewes he grazes basically all reach the point of being fat and strong, and always in good condition.
　　Abu Le attaches great importance to breeding work. In addition to selecting rams with strong physiques, good wool quality, and high wool production to be kept as breeding rams, he also strictly controls the lambing season of the ewes. During the lambing period, in addition to increasing the number of herders following the flock, lamb sheds were built, lambing bags and feeding devices were prepared, and artificial feeding was also carried out for ewes that produced twins or lambs lacking milk. When the lambs' breathing was abnormal, sheep manure was applied to their bodies to protect them from the cold and relieve dampness, which improved the survival rate. Now, after Abu Le's flock of ewes have successively given birth to lambs last winter, they have all been bred with Xinjiang rams after being injected with pregnant women's urine as an estrus-inducing agent. Abu Le has proposed that this year the reproductive rate of all 400 ewes should reach 200%.

　　Five Little Veterinarians
　　At the recent Qinghai Provincial Representative Meeting of Advanced Units in Socialist Construction of Animal Husbandry, the veterinary team of the Canmei People's Commune in Henan Mongolian Autonomous County was also awarded. The five members of this veterinary team are: Ai Duo, Qie Ga, Xue Ri Jinmu, Zhuoma Cuo, and Zhuoma. They are mostly around sixteen or seventeen years old.
　　In June last year, bovine septicemia was very prevalent in the Canmei People's Commune. The county sent a veterinarian to carry out prevention and treatment, and asked Ai Duo and the others to help the veterinarian pull the cattle and fetch things. At that time, they thought: Veterinarians are very scarce. If they could learn to treat cattle diseases themselves, it would be much more convenient for the commune's cattle to be treated in the future. Therefore, in addition to pulling cattle and fetching things, they followed along to learn the techniques. Because they learned with an open mind, they quickly mastered general medical techniques. The commune party committee decided to form a veterinary team of five of them and assigned them the task of preventing and controlling animal diseases.
　　From then on, they became even more active. Regardless of whether it was day or night, they always traveled back and forth to the teams to carry out prevention and control work. When the medicine ran out, they rode horses to the county overnight to fetch it. After treating the cattle in their own commune, they ran to neighboring communes to help treat them. In more than a month from late July to early September last year, they injected more than 10,000 cattle with septicemia and anthrax vaccines.
　　In order to cultivate and improve them, the commune party committee recently sent them to the county's animal husbandry and veterinary training class to study, so that they could understand more knowledge about the prevention and control of animal diseases. Now, they have been assigned to the commune's specialized teams of horses, cattle, and sheep to serve as veterinarians and shepherds, and to undertake the work of training new veterinary personnel.

　　“羊羔妈妈”
    在海北藏族自治州的苏吉滩人民公社里，有一群羊羔和藏族女放牧员杜尕什姐特别亲热。当杜尕什姐到它们跟前的时候，它们就像孩子见了妈妈一样，又蹦又跳地把杜尕什姐围起来；当它们看见杜尕什姐坐下来时，就争先恐后地爬到杜尕什姐的身上。杜尕什姐也不断地用手去抚摸它们，她爱它们如同母亲爱自己的孩子一样。因此，公社里好多人都叫杜尕什姐是“羊羔妈妈”。
    去年冬天，苏吉滩人民公社成千的羊羔出世了。其中有一百四十只羊羔由于母羊体质不好或年龄过老，没有奶吃，非常瘦弱。这时，杜尕什姐想到公社里订的1959年跃进计划是羊羔成活率达到97.5％，如果不精心饲养这些羊羔，任务就难以完成。于是，她积极向公社领导建议，成立了羊羔哺乳室。哺乳室的工作就由她自己和另外三个女放牧员担任。她们四人利用在业余中学里所学到的医疗技术知识，细心地护理着一百四十只无母奶吃的羊羔。她们利用黄豆等原料制成人造羊奶，羊羔不会吃，她们就用奶瓶和奶嘴喂。她们还上山打来木料，建了一排羔羊棚，棚里分成若干小卧室。这些小卧室，每天被打扫得干干净净，用石灰消毒，晚上还垫一些干土和干粪，天气好的时候，她们就把小羊羔领出去玩、晒太阳。为了照顾羊羔，杜尕什姐等还把自己的被褥搬到羔羊棚旁边去睡。冬夜，青海草原特别冷，她总是冒着严寒起来看小羊羔。现在，这一百四十只小羊羔，在她们无微不至的照料下，个个生长得很健壮。

　　阿布勒和母羊群
    海北藏族自治州祁连县永跃人民公社藏族社员阿布勒放牧的一群母绵羊，出现了繁殖成活率高达126.32％的高额丰产纪录。阿布勒放牧的这群母羊，共有四百三十七只，去年所产羊羔一共成活了五百五十二只，其中有一百四十只母羊，一年产了两胎，共产羔二百八十只，全部成活。
    阿布勒是当地有名的牧羊能手。为了使母羊多胎多产，他分别季节、水草以及母羊体质等不同情况，对这个羊群进行着精心的护理。夏秋草好，正是抓膘季节，他就竭力延长放牧时间。天刚亮就出圈，直到天黑归圈。中午天热，他就注意让母羊休息两三小时。冬春风大天寒，牧草枯黄，他就经常转移牧地，把羊赶在草多、避风的沟沟弯弯处放牧，使羊吃饱、吃好。为了尽量增强母羊体质，防止流产，他还分别不同季节，采取了各种有效措施。因此，他放牧的这群母羊，基本上达到了只只肥壮、常年满膘。
    阿布勒非常重视配种工作。他除了挑选体格健壮、毛质好、产毛多的公羊留作种羊，还严格掌握母羊产羔季节。产羔期间除增加放牧员跟群放牧，修了羔羊棚，准备了接羔袋和哺乳器，对产双羔或缺奶羔羊还专门进行人工哺乳。发现羊羔呼吸不正常时，就用羊粪涂抹身体，防寒解潮，提高了成活率。现在，阿布勒放牧的这群母羊，在去冬相继产羔以后，经过注射孕妇尿作催情剂，已经全部用新疆种羊配了种。阿布勒提出，今年要使全群四百多只母羊的繁殖率都达到百分之二百。
    五个小兽医
    最近召开的青海省畜牧业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议上，河南蒙族自治县参美人民公社的兽医小组也得到了奖励。这个兽医小组的五个成员是：艾多、切尕、雪日金木、卓玛错、卓玛。他们的年龄大都是十六、七岁左右。
    去年6月间，参美人民公社的牛败血症流行得很厉害，县上派来一个兽医人员进行预防治疗，并要艾多他们帮助兽医拉牛、取东西。当时，他们想：兽医非常缺少，如果自己能学会给牛治病，以后社里牛生了病，就方便多了。于是，他们除拉拉牛、取取东西外，就跟着学技术。由于他们虚心学习，很快就掌握了一般的医疗技术。公社党委决定由他们五人组成一个兽医小组，并把防治兽疫的任务交给他们。
    从此以后，他们更积极了。不管黑夜白天，他们总是往返奔波各队，进行防治工作。药用完了，就连夜骑马到县上去取。自己社里的牛治完了，又跑到邻社去帮助治疗。从去年7月下旬到9月上旬的一个多月中，他们就给一万多头牛注射了败血症和炭疽疫苗。
    为了培养提高他们，不久前，公社党委把他们送到县畜牧兽医训练班学习，使他们懂得了更多的兽疫防治知识。现在，他们已被分配到公社的马、牛、羊等专业队去担任兽医员兼放牧员，并担任培养新兽医人员的工作。　（彭雪）
