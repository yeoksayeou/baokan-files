Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 11th: Since the beginning of spring this year, construction has been seen everywhere in the cities and villages of Czechoslovakia.

The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party passed a resolution on solving the housing problem at a meeting held in early March this year. The resolution stipulates that 1.2 million housing units will be built by 1970. This decision has received enthusiastic support from all working people. Accelerating housing construction has now become a national task.

This year, the state's investment in housing construction has increased by 27.4% compared to last year. In addition, local people's committees, factories, enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, etc., will also vigorously build houses with the help of the state, mainly relying on their own strength.

The Stalin Chemical Plant in Litvínov has already begun to build seventy workers' residences and a large swimming pool. Workers at this plant will participate in construction work in batches. Most factories in the Ústí Region have studied the problem of workers' housing and made comprehensive plans. They proposed to use factory waste to manufacture various building materials to reduce the state's supply of building materials.

Members of an agricultural production cooperative in České Budějovice are using slack farming seasons or holidays to lay the foundations for sixty-eight new houses. The entire construction project will be completed by the cooperative members themselves, and the installation of indoor heating, electric lights, etc., will be assisted by workers from nearby factories.

Workers in the construction sector are mainly busy with the construction of key projects. Construction workers in the Ostrava Region put forward the slogan of "building houses faster and more economically." Construction workers in Hradec Králové proposed to complete the 1965 task one year ahead of schedule.

By 1970, every family will have a well-equipped home. All service industries and various public welfare facilities, such as shops, schools, nurseries, hospitals, and sports fields, will be opened and built in the new residential areas.

In order to speed up the pace of housing construction and reduce labor and material consumption, Czechoslovakia is vigorously promoting the use of industrial methods to build houses.

　　捷克斯洛伐克兴建广厦千万间
　　到1970年每家都将有一套好住宅
    据新华社布拉格11日电　今年开春以来在捷克斯洛伐克的城市和乡村，到处都可以看到大兴土木的景象。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会在今年3月初举行的会议上通过了一项关于解决住宅问题的决议。决议规定，到1970年将建成一百二十万套住宅。这个决定得到了全体劳动人民的热烈支持。加速住宅建筑目前已成了一项全民的任务。
    今年国家在房屋建筑方面的投资比去年增加了27.4％。此外，各地方人民委员会、工厂企业、农业合作社等也都将在国家的帮助下，主要依靠自己的力量大力兴建住宅。
    利特维诺夫州的斯大林化学工厂已经开始兴建七十套工人住宅和一个大的游泳池。这个工厂的工人将分批参加建筑工作。乌斯蒂州的大多数工厂都研究了解决工人住宅的问题，并作了通盘的规划。他们提出要利用工厂的废料制造各种建筑材料，以减少国家对建筑材料的供应。
    契斯克·布德约维泽州的一个农业生产合作社的社员们正利用农闲或假日紧张地为六十八套新住宅打基石。整个建筑工程都由合作社社员们自己来完成，室内的暖气、电灯等的装置将得到附近工厂的工人们的帮助。
    建筑部门的工人主要忙于一些重点工程的建筑。俄斯特拉发州的建筑工人提出了“更快、更省地建筑住宅”的口号。赫拉岱茨—克拉罗维州的建筑工人提出要提前一年完成1965年的任务。
    到1970年，每一个家庭都将有一套设备良好的住宅。在新的住宅区将开设一切服务性行业和兴建各种公共福利设施，如商店、学校、托儿所、医院、运动场等。
    为了加快房屋建筑的速度，并减少劳动及材料的耗费，捷克斯洛伐克正大力提倡采用工业化的方法兴建住宅。
