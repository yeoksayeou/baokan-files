　　Several apricot trees in the seedling plot are budding.

　　The sweet potato seedling season has begun. This year's sweet potato seeds were well-preserved, and when they were dug up from the well, they didn't even have any dark spots. The commune members happily said to the technician Xu Chunshan, "Old Xu! We've chosen the good seeds, now we're counting on you for what comes next."

　　Xu Chunshan was named an outstanding technician because he raised good sweet potato seedlings last year. This year, the commune decided to plant 2,500 mu of sweet potatoes, tripling the area from previous years, and the yield per mu is expected to reach 10,000 jin. Whether the target can be achieved depends entirely on the seedling stage. For this reason, the commune considered it over and over, and finally gave the task to Xu Chunshan again.

　　With the gentle breeze and warm sun, the sweet potato seeds on the kang sprouted tender yellow buds after a few days. To take care of them, Old Xu moved to the seedling garden. When he had nothing to do, he would rest, light his pipe, take a few puffs, look at the apricot blossoms in full bloom in the garden, see the sweet potato buds growing vigorously, and think about how his wife was about to give birth to a son – Old Xu was almost fifty, and this was his first child. He couldn't help but smile.

　　At night, a northeast wind suddenly blew. Old Xu knew the weather was about to change, so he quickly got to work. He covered each kang with straw mats and then busied himself testing the temperature of the kang. He saw fourteen degrees, thirteen degrees, the temperature was constantly dropping, and he went down the ladder to stoke the fire. By the time everything was ready, it was late at night, and rain mixed with snowflakes began to fall.

　　Suddenly, the high-pitched scream of "Uncle, Uncle" came from afar. It was the voice of Xizi from the neighbor's house. In an instant, Xizi was already in front of him. She said breathlessly, "Uncle, go home quickly, Auntie needs you urgently..."

　　Go home? Xu Chunshan thought of his wife who was about to give birth and couldn't wait to go back in one step. But looking back at those sweet potato seedlings, the buds had just emerged, and the weather was changing again. The commune's increased production of sweet potatoes this year depended entirely on these seedlings. What if they froze? Thinking of this, he said to Xizi, "Good child, please run to the front street and ask Doctor Liu to come."

　　"What, aren't you going back?" Xizi asked with wide eyes.

　　"Look at these seedlings." Old Xu pointed with his hand, and the clever Xizi understood. She turned and ran out.

　　After Xizi left, Xu Chunshan's heart was in his throat. He stood in front of the kang for a moment and then checked the temperature again. Oh, it had dropped again. He quickly added coal to the stove and poked the flames again.

　　At daybreak, the gate of the seedling garden creaked open, and a beam of electric light shone in. The commune leader had come to see him. Seeing that his face was yellow and dry, and he was covered in grass and mud, the commune leader quickly said, "Old Xu, go home and warm up, I'll take over for you." At this time, Xu Chunshan remembered his wife who was about to give birth. Was the child born smoothly? He immediately became anxious again.

　　When Xu Chunshan arrived home, the red light of the sun was rising into the sky. A burst of "wah wah" baby cries immediately cheered him up. He forgot all his fatigue and ran into the house in three steps. The women from the neighbors were all in the room. When they saw Xu Chunshan, they all rushed to congratulate him, "A chubby son!" Xu Chunshan looked at his wife lying on the kang with a smile and, without knowing why, blurted out, "The temperature is just right, not a single seedling was lost!"

    育苗田里的几棵杏花正含苞欲放。
    地瓜育苗的季节开始了。今年的地瓜种，因为保存得好，从井里扒上来连个乌斑也没有。社员们都欢喜地对技术员徐春山说：“老徐啊！俺们选好种，底下的事儿可看你的啦。”
    徐春山因为去年育地瓜苗好，被大家评为优秀技术员。今年社里决定种地瓜二千五百亩，比往年翻三番，亩产要达一万斤。指标能否达到，全在育苗这一关。为这个，社里考虑来、考虑去，最后又把这个任务交给了徐春山。
    风和日暖，几天以后，炕上的地瓜种都钻出了嫩黄的芽子。为了服侍它们，老徐就搬到育苗园里来住了。没事的时候，歇了下来，点起烟袋吧哒吧哒抽几口，看着满园盛开的杏花，看到见风就长的地瓜芽子，想到老婆就要生儿子了——老徐将近五十了，这还是第一个孩子呢，他不由得笑眯了眼。
    夜里，忽然刮起了东北风。老徐知道天要变脸了，便赶忙动作起来。他把每个炕上的草帘子一一盖好后，又忙着试炕的温度。只见十四度，十三度，温度不住地往下降，他又走下梯道，把炉火弄旺。等到一切就绪，夜已深了，雨夹着雪花下起来了。
    突然，老远传来“大爷、大爷”的尖叫声。这是邻家的喜子的声音。刹那间，喜子已经来到面前了。她气喘吁吁地说：“大爷，快回家吧，大娘有急事……”
    回家？徐春山想起临产的妻子，巴不得一步跨回去。可是回头一看，那些地瓜苗子，芽刚出齐，偏偏又碰上变天。今年社里增产地瓜，全靠这些苗子，要是冻坏呢……想到这儿，他对喜子说：“好孩子，你跑一趟吧，到前街去请刘医生。”
    “怎么，你不回去？”喜子睁大眼睛说。
    “你瞧这些苗子。”老徐用手一指，伶俐的喜子就明白了。她拨头就往外跑去。
    喜子走后，徐春山的心七上八下的。他站在炕前怔了一下，就又一次检查起温度来。呀，又下降了。他赶快给炉子加煤，把火苗再拨弄一下。
    天傍明时，育苗园的大门吱地一响，一溜电光射进来，社长来看他了。社长见他脸干黄黄的，浑身草叶泥土，赶紧说：“老徐，快回家暖和暖和去吧，我来替你。”这时候，徐春山才又想起了临产的妻子。孩子生得顺不顺当呢？他立刻又焦急起来。
    徐春山到家的时候，太阳的红光正冲天出来。一阵“哇哇”的娃啼声让他精神马上一振。他浑身的疲劳全忘了，三步两步跑进屋去。左邻右舍的妇女都在屋里，一见徐春山都争着给他道喜：“一个胖儿子！”徐春山看了看微笑着躺在炕上的妻子，不知怎的，冲口说出一句：“温度不高不低，一棵苗芽也没损失！”
