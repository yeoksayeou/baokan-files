	Love the Motherland, Rely on the Masses
	-- How Zhan Tianyou Built the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway

	Today, April 24th, is the 40th anniversary of Zhan Tianyou's death.

	If you take the Beijing-Baotou railway and pass Qinglongqiao Station, you will see a towering bronze statue – a statue of the outstanding railway engineer Zhan Tianyou. The Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway from Beijing to Zhangjiakou was the first railway built by China itself, and the engineer who presided over the construction of this railway was Zhan Tianyou.

	The Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway is more than 300 li long. From Nankou to Kangzhuang, the mountains are stacked upon each other, and the cliffs reach the sky. The Badaling and Juyongguan passes stand in the way, making the construction project very difficult. At that time, imperialist elements, upon hearing that Zhan Tianyou was coming to build this railway, ridiculed Zhan Tianyou for overestimating his capabilities. A British newspaper even contemptuously said: "The engineer who can build this railway in China has not yet been born!" But Zhan Tianyou replied: "Yes, we don't have many engineers yet, but that doesn't matter. As long as we have workers and management personnel, I can help them, and they can also help me. We can definitely complete this project together." So, during the day, he took students and workers to climb mountains and ridges to survey the route; at night, he hunched over the oil lamp to draw and calculate. They painstakingly measured six routes for comparative study, one of which is the Fengsha Railway route today, which is the most ideal route with a very small slope. However, due to the need to excavate more tunnels and build more bridges, the project would be more difficult. The corrupt Qing government was unwilling to spend more money to build the railway, so they had to choose the route that climbs Juyongguan and Badaling. In the process of surveying, designing, and constructing, Zhan Tianyou always consulted with the workers and listened to their opinions with an open mind. When encountering difficulties, he always thought: this is the first railway built by the Chinese themselves, and it must be built well, otherwise not only will those foreigners laugh at us, but it will also cause Chinese engineers to lose confidence. There are many bridges on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou line, and he tried his best to use domestically produced cement and stone to build them. He said: "Anything we can manufacture ourselves, we will definitely not buy from foreign countries." In this way, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway was completed in four years, two years ahead of the original plan.

	Zhan Tianyou has been dead for forty years, but today at Qinglongqiao Station we still see him standing there, looking into the distance, watching, watching, watching the land of the motherland. The Fengsha Road that he surveyed and selected has been built and opened to traffic; the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway that he was concerned about has been built and opened to traffic; on the land of the motherland, the railway network is spreading rapidly. This is a whole broad era! Today, the ambitions of engineering and technical personnel are flying freely! Who can imagine how happy this outstanding engineer - Zhan Tianyou - must be!

### 热爱祖国　依靠群众——詹天佑怎样修建京张铁路

    热爱祖国　依靠群众
    ——詹天佑怎样修建京张铁路
    亦朋
    今天，4月24日，是詹天佑逝世的四十周年纪念。
    如果你乘京包路的火车经过青龙桥车站的时候，你就会看到一座矗立的铜像——杰出的铁路工程师詹天佑的铜像。原来从北京到张家口的这条京张铁路是我国自己兴建的第一条铁路，主持兴建这条铁路的工程师就是詹天佑。
    京张铁路全长三百余里，南口到康庄一段，重山叠嶂，峭壁顶天，八达岭和居庸关横梗其间，修建工程是非常艰巨的。当时帝国主义分子听说詹天佑要来修筑这条铁路的消息时，就讽刺詹天佑不自量力。英国报纸更轻蔑地说：“中国能修这条铁路的工程师还没有诞生呢！”可是詹天佑回答说：“是的，我们还没有许多工程师，但这没有关系，只要我们有工人和管理人员，我能帮助他们，他们也能帮助我，我们一定可以共同完成这个工程。”于是他白天带着学生和工人攀山越岭，勘测线路；夜晚，他伏在油灯下面绘图计算。他们辛勤地测量了六条线路来做比较研究，其中一条就是今天丰沙路的线路，这是一条坡度很小的最理想的线路。但是由于要开凿更多的隧道，架设更多的桥梁，工程要更加艰巨。腐败的清朝政府不肯多拿钱来修铁路，他们只好选择了攀登居庸关和八达岭的这条路线。在勘测、设计、施工过程中，詹天佑总是和工人们商量，虚心听取他们的意见。遇到困难时，他总是想：这是中国人自筑的第一条铁路，一定要把它修好，否则不但那些外国人要讥笑，而且会使中国工程师失掉信心。京张线上有不少桥梁，他都尽量利用我国自产的水泥和石料来修建，他说：“凡是我们自己能够制造的，我们一定不到外国去购买。”就这样，京张铁路用了四年的时间比原来计划提早两年完成了。
    詹天佑逝世四十年了，然而我们今天在青龙桥车站还看到他站立在那里，他正在极目远眺，看呵，看呵，看着祖国的大地。那曾经为他调查、选用的丰沙路修建了，通车了；那曾经被他惦念的成渝路修建了，通车了；在祖国的大地上，铁路网飞快地撒开。这是整整的一个广阔的时代！今天，工程技术人员的雄心壮志自由地飞翔！谁能想像这个杰出的工程师——詹天佑该是多么的高兴呵！
