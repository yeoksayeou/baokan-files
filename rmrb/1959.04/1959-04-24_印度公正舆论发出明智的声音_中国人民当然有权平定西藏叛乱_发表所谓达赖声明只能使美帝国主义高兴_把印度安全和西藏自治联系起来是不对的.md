Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 22nd: The Urdu newspaper "Inqilab" ("Unity") published an editorial today on the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," saying that for Indians, deciding "which side to sympathize with and whom to sympathize with" is "a matter of deep interest."

The editorial, after analyzing the social structure of Tibet and the true roots of the rebellion, said, "Among the Tibetans, there is a call for getting rid of the landlord system," so the reactionary groups "launched a rebellion."

The newspaper said, "The Chinese neither crowned the rebels with garlands nor built arches to welcome them. They simply quelled the rebellion." The editorial expressed complete confidence that, after crushing the rebellion, "Tibet will establish a government of the vast majority of Tibetans themselves."

The editorial emphasized that Tibet is a part of China, and China should exercise sovereignty there. The editorial said, "When we talk about autonomy, we should only say the autonomy of Tibet." The editorial believes that linking India's security with the issue of Tibetan autonomy is wrong.

The newspaper pointed out that India's independence is not threatened, so why should we fight for Tibet, and this is "not for the million Tibetans there, but for a few thousand landlords." The newspaper asked, "For a few thousand landlords, we have to incur the hatred of a million Tibetans; turning 600 million Chinese into our enemies," "Please think about whether doing this is correct?"

The Tamil daily "Makkal Sakti" ("People's Power") published an editorial on April 20th, saying that the statement issued in the name of the Dalai Lama "can only please U.S. imperialists, who are attempting to plot all despicable tricks on the Tibetan issue to create division between India and China."

The newspaper further said that the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" actually admits that an armed rebellion against the People's Liberation Army stationed in its own territory had occurred in Tibet. The "statement" also acknowledges that the Dalai Lama's "subordinates were more concerned about his safety than he himself was." The "statement" also admits that "without the organized support of the rebels for him (the Dalai Lama), he would not have been able to leave Lhasa. All of this shows that the upper reactionary group of Tibetan monks caused the violence."

The newspaper refuted the "statement's" claim that the Dalai Lama was dissatisfied with the "interference" in Tibet after the Chinese Central Government and the Tibetan local government signed an agreement in 1951. The newspaper said that the Dalai Lama visited India in 1956, five years after signing the agreement, and traveled to many places, and he was not heard to complain about Chinese "interference." On the contrary, he praised the progressive path pointed out by Chairman Mao Zedong on the platforms of many mass rallies across India at that time. The reactionary feudal groups in Tibet launched a rebellion in order to maintain their rule over the poor and backward Tibetan masses. This "rebellion is not a national uprising, but merely a rebellion of feudal reactionaries, and the Chinese people certainly have the right to quell it."

The "National Herald" published an editorial yesterday saying, "China is very concerned about encouraging all nationalities and their cultures. But it will not concede in one aspect, that is, Tibet will be regarded as a part of Chinese territory, and it will not relax its attention to national security. The Indian people who are concerned about their own security will understand China's desire for security. Zhou Enlai hopes that Sino-Indian friendship will become stronger through this test, and his hope will be widely supported in this country."

### 印度公正舆论发出明智的声音  中国人民当然有权平定西藏叛乱  发表所谓达赖声明只能使美帝国主义高兴  把印度安全和西藏自治联系起来是不对的

    印度公正舆论发出明智的声音
    中国人民当然有权平定西藏叛乱
    发表所谓达赖声明只能使美帝国主义高兴
    把印度安全和西藏自治联系起来是不对的
    新华社新德里22日电　乌尔都文“团结报”今天就所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”发表社论说，对印度人来说，决定“同情那一边和同情什么人”“是一件有深切利害关系的事”。
    社论在分析了西藏的社会结构和这次叛乱的真正根源以后说，“在西藏人中间有要求摆脱地主制度的呼声”，因此反动集团就“发动叛乱”。
    这家报纸说，“中国人既没有给叛乱分子戴花冠，也没有建立牌楼来欢迎他们。只是平定了叛乱”。社论表示完全相信，在粉碎了叛乱之后，“西藏将成立一个绝大多数西藏人自己的政府”。
    社论强调指出，西藏是中国的一部分，中国应当在那边行使主权。社论说，“当我们谈到自治的时候，我们只应当说西藏的自治”。社论认为，把印度安全问题同西藏自治问题联系起来是不对的。
    这家报纸指出，印度的独立并没有受到威胁，我们为什么要为西藏而斗争呢，而且这还“不是为了那边的一百万西藏人，而是为了几千个地主”。这家报纸问道，“为了几千个地主，我们却要招致一百万西藏人的仇恨；把六亿中国人变成我们的敌人，”“请想一想，这样做是否正确呢？”
    泰米尔语日报“人民力量报”4月20日发表社论说，以达赖喇嘛的名义所发表的声明“只能使美帝国主义者高兴，他们企图在西藏事件上策划一切卑鄙的诡计在印度和中国之间制造分裂。”
    这家报纸又说，所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”实际上承认，在西藏曾经发生过反对驻在自己领土上的人民解放军的武装叛乱。这项“声明”，还承认达赖喇嘛的“部下比他自己更关心他的安全”。“声明”还承认，“如果没有叛乱分子对他（达赖喇嘛）提供有组织的支持，他原是不可能离开拉萨的。所有这一切都表明了这点，引起暴力行为的是西藏僧侣的上层反动集团。”
    这家报纸驳斥了“声明”中所谓达赖喇嘛在1951年中国中央政府同西藏地方政府签订协议以后对西藏遭到“干涉”的不满的这种说法。这家报纸说，达赖喇嘛签订了这项协议五年以后在1956年访问印度时走了很多地方，并没有听到他讲过不满中国“干涉”的话。恰恰相反，他那次在印度全国各地许多群众集会的讲台上赞扬毛泽东主席所指出的进步道路。西藏的反动的封建集团为了要维持他们对贫穷落后的西藏群众的统治，因此发动了叛乱。这种“叛乱不是民族起义，而只是封建反动分子的叛乱，中国人当然有权利予以平定。”
    “国民先驱报”昨天发表社论说，“中国非常关心鼓励各个民族和他们的文化。但是在一个方面将不让步，那就是西藏将被认为是中国领土的一部分，并且将不放松对国家安全的注意。关心自己安全的印度人民将会了解中国对安全的愿望，周恩来希望中印友谊通过这次考验变得更为牢固，他的这种希望在这个国家中将获得普遍的赞同。”
