Sowing Seeds of Abundance on the Industrial Landscape
Youth Worker Advanced Experience Observation Group Begins Performances in the Capital
Ministry of Coal and Ministry of Geology Promote Advanced Experiences such as Drilling Rig Automation

    This newspaper reports that the National Youth Worker Advanced Experience Observation Group, initiated and organized by the Communist Youth League Central Committee, has arrived in Beijing. Yesterday and the day before, they exchanged advanced experiences and demonstrated advanced technologies in more than a dozen factories in Beijing.
    The Youth Worker Advanced Experience Observation Group is composed of the most technically outstanding young workers from thirteen provinces and cities across the country, covering five fields: metallurgy, machinery, electricity, textiles, and construction. Among them are Hao Jinfang, furnace leader of the Youth Friendship Furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, whose open-hearth utilization coefficient has reached the international advanced level; Zhang Yupu, furnace leader of the Youth Blast Furnace at Benxi Iron and Steel Company, a national youth blast furnace champion; Liao Shigang, a technical innovation expert and milling worker at Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, who has increased production efficiency by a maximum of 28,960 times; Wang Guiying, representative of the nationally renowned Yi Shijuan Group of Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill; and Zhang Baifa, captain of the Beijing No. 3 Construction Company Youth Shock Brigade, along with a total of fifty-five advanced young workers and young engineering technicians. The observation group is headed by Liang Buting, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, and was organized by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China to cooperate with the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Industry. They will go to factories in twenty large and medium-sized cities across the country to promote and disseminate advanced experiences and technologies in carrying out mass movements, technical revolutions, implementing "two participations, three combinations," and the experiences of the Communist Youth League in factory work.
    Technical innovation expert Liao Shigang was surrounded by more than forty mechanical workers from more than a dozen machinery factories in Beijing the day before yesterday. After visiting Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, this technical expert put forward twenty-five rationalization proposals. His high-speed milling method for plane surfaces is 137 times more efficient than the original method used at Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory. Chen Ai'e, a roving frame worker from Wuhan State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill, showed her skills at Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill. Her agile piecing motions attracted all the young workers who came to learn. On average, she pieced twenty-five ends per minute, which is almost twice as efficient as the average piecing efficiency of workers at Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill. After the demonstration, she held a discussion with more than fifty workers from eight cotton textile factories in Beijing who came to learn. At the meeting, everyone stated that they must be good "sowing team members" and ensure that their advanced experience blossoms and bears fruit in Beijing. On the 1st, members of the Communist Youth League at Shougang Group, Beijing People's Machine Factory and other units gave wonderful performances.
    All members of the Youth Worker Advanced Experience Observation Group arrived in Beijing successively from March 28th to 31st. On March 31st, more than 4,000 young worker representatives from Beijing held a grand gathering at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall to warmly welcome these outstanding young workers who are spreading advanced experiences and technologies. At the meeting, Liang Buting, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, delivered a speech. Liang Buting said that in this year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward, it is particularly important to widely disseminate existing advanced experiences and advanced technologies. Any advanced experience or advanced technology, if only mastered by a few people, has little economic significance. However, if the advanced level of a few people is quickly transformed into the general level of the whole society, it will greatly increase labor productivity and create huge material wealth. The task of the observation group is to promote and learn simultaneously in factories across the country, boost morale, promote a high tide, and play a good role in promoting the technical revolution movement on the national industrial front. Wang Zhaohua, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, also spoke at the meeting. Liao Shigang, a milling worker from Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, and Chen Ai'e, a female roving frame worker from Wuhan State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill, also spoke at the meeting on behalf of all members of the Advanced Experience Observation Group. They stated that they would wholeheartedly disseminate their experiences and technologies to young workers in factories across the country, and humbly learn from others' advanced experiences.
    The Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has selected more than 500 advanced young workers from more than a dozen factories in Beijing to follow the observation group and learn advanced technologies.

    Xinhua News Agency reports that the staff of the Beipiao 155 Team of the Liaoning Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau, carrying forward the spirit of daring to think and act, emphasizing self-reliance, and engaging in large-scale technical revolution, have achieved full automation of drilling rigs, thereby greatly increasing labor efficiency. The Ministry of Coal Industry recently held a national coalfield geological exploration on-site conference in Beipiao to summarize and promote the experience of this team; the experiences created by coalfield exploration teams in various regions were also exchanged at the meeting.
    During the Great Leap Forward last year, the 155 Exploration Team independently researched, designed, and manufactured a complete set of accessories, enabling the full automation of 300-meter, 500-meter, and 1,000-meter drilling rigs, thereby freeing them from the heavy manual labor involved in drilling rig operation. Due to automation, this team can increase the pure drilling time by about ten to twenty days every hundred days compared to the past. In the past, it took fifteen to twenty seconds to manually unscrew a drill pipe, but now it only takes three to five seconds; previously, when drilling, about thirty minutes out of every five meters were spent on supporting and reversing the rod, but with the new accessories, this time can be completely used for pure drilling. Full automation of drilling rigs can also save many auxiliary tools and ensure safe production.
    The meeting believes that the experience of the 155 Team in drilling rig automation is not only applicable to coalfield drilling rigs, but can also be used on drilling rigs under the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry.
    The meeting also decided to vigorously promote the non-core drilling electrical measurement interpretation method and the new radioactive logging technology in areas with electrical logging equipment; promote the experience of comprehensive rapid exploration method combining geological and geophysical prospecting adopted by Shandong and Liaoning provinces to accelerate the reconnaissance and detailed investigation of concealed coalfields; promote the experience of Shanxi and Shandong provinces in using geophysical prospecting methods to explore hydrogeology.

    Xinhua News Agency reports that implementing rapid exploration to quickly provide more abundant mineral resources for industrial production departments is an important work direction for China's geological departments. This is the conclusion reached by the Ministry of Geology at the rapid exploration on-site conference recently held at the Jingwan Iron Mine in Dengfeng County, Henan Province.
    The Jingwan Iron Mine in Dengfeng County is a newly discovered medium-sized deposit with industrial value, with a relatively complex geological structure, relatively good outcrops, and a relatively stable stratigraphy. Such deposits generally require seven months to a year of exploration time; however, according to the specific circumstances here, the Yu 05 Team of the Henan Provincial Geological Bureau implemented a rapid exploration method, which reduced the amount of work by half and the investment by more than 50% compared with the general exploration method, and submitted a detailed geological exploration report in only four months.
    In its exploration work, the Jingwan Iron Mine adopted an exploration method that was adapted to local conditions, divided into blocks and sections, with sparse drilling where it should be sparse and dense drilling where it should be dense. As a result, the amount of drilling was reduced from the originally designed thirteen to eight; the originally planned 2,900 meters were reduced to only 1,450 meters, while still controlling the reserves.
    In its exploration work, this team also broke with superstition and replaced groove cutting with the continuous block picking method, increasing efficiency by more than fifty times.

    在工业大地上播下丰产种籽
    青年工人先进经验观摩团开始在首都表演
    煤炭部地质部推广钻机自动化等先进经验
    本报讯　由共青团中央发起和组织的全国青年工人先进经验观摩团已经来到北京。昨天和前天，他们分别在北京十多个工厂交流了先进经验，表演了先进技术。
    青年工人先进经验观摩团，是由全国十三个省市、包括冶金、机械、电力、纺织、建筑等五个方面技术最优秀的青年工人组成的。其中有平炉利用系数达到国际先进水平的鞍山钢铁公司第一炼钢厂青年友谊炉炉长郝金芳，有全国青年高炉冠军——本溪钢铁公司青年高炉炉长张玉璞，有技术革新能手、最高提高生产效率二万八千九百六十倍的重庆建设机床厂铣工廖世刚，有全国著名的上海国棉二厂裔式娟小组的代表王桂英，北京建筑三公司青年突击队队长张百发等先进青年工人、青年工程技术人员共五十五人。由团中央书记处书记梁步庭担任观摩团的团长，这个观摩团是中国共产主义青年团中央委员会为了配合全国工业先进集体和先进生产者代表会议而组织的。他们将到全国二十个大中城市的工厂推广、传播大搞群众运动、技术革命、贯彻“两参三结合”的先进经验和先进技术，以及共青团在工厂工作的经验。
    技术革新能手廖世刚，前天被北京十多个机械厂的四十多名机械工人包围了，这位技术能手在参观北京第一机床厂以后，就提出二十五项合理化建议。他的高速铣平面方法，比北京第一机床厂原来的工效提高一百三十七倍。武汉国棉一厂细纱工陈爱娥在北京第二棉纺织厂大显身手，她那敏捷的接头动作，吸引了所有前来学习的青年工人。她平均每分钟接了二十五个断头，比北京第二棉纺织厂工人的平均接头效率高近一倍。她在表演以后，并同前来学习的北京八个棉纺织厂的五十多名工人举行了座谈会，在会上大家提出一定要当好“播种队员”，保证使她们的先进经验在北京开花结果。1日在石景山钢铁公司、北京人民机器厂等单位的团员们都作了精彩的表演。
    青年工人先进经验观摩团的全体团员是在3月28日到31日先后来到北京的。在3月31日，北京市四千多名青年职工代表在中山公园音乐堂举行了盛大的集会，热烈欢迎这些传播先进经验和先进技术的优秀青年工人。在大会上，中国共产主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记梁步庭讲了话。梁步庭说，在今年更大、更好、更全面跃进的一年中，广泛传播已有的先进经验和先进技术是特别重要的，任何一种先进经验和先进技术，如果只为少数人所掌握，那就没有多大的经济意义。但是如果将少数人的先进水平迅速变成全社会的普遍水平，那就会大大地提高劳动生产率，创造巨大的物质财富。观摩团的任务，就是要在全国各地工厂中边推广、边学习，鼓干劲，促高潮，对全国工业战线上开展技术革命运动起良好的推动作用。中国共产主义青年团北京市委员会书记王照华也在会上讲了话。重庆建设机床厂铣工廖世刚和武汉国棉一厂细纱女工陈爱娥代表全体先进经验观摩团团员也在会上讲了话。他们表示，要全心全意地把自己的经验和技术传播给全国各地工厂的青年工人，并虚心学习别人的先进经验。
    团市委在北京十多个工厂里抽调了五百多名先进青年工人，跟随着观摩团习学先进技术。
    据新华社讯　辽宁煤田地质勘探局北票一五五队的职工发扬敢想敢干的精神，强调自力更生，大搞技术革命，实现了钻机全面自动化，从而使劳动效率大大提高。煤炭工业部最近在北票召开了全国煤田地质勘探现场会议，总结和推广了这个队的经验；各地煤田勘探队创造的经验，同时在会上进行了交流。
    一五五勘探队在去年大跃进当中，自力更生地研究、设计和制造成功了一整套配件，使三百公尺、五百公尺、一千公尺的钻机全面实现了自动化，从而摆脱了钻机操作方面的笨重的体力劳动。这个队由于操作自动化，平均一百天可以比过去增加十天到二十天左右的纯钻进时间。过去使用人力拧卸一根钻杆需要十五到二十秒钟，现在只要
  三到五秒钟就够了；以前钻进时，每进五公尺约有三十多分钟用在扶把倒杆上，有了新的配件之后，这部分时间可以完全用在纯钻进上了。钻机全面自动化以后，还能节省许多辅助工具和保证安全生产。
    会议认为，一五五队钻机自动化的经验，不仅适用于煤田钻机上，而且可以使用在地质部和冶金工业部所属的钻机上。
    会议还决定在凡有电测井设备的地区，大力推广无岩芯钻进电测解释法和放射性测井新技术；推广山东和辽宁省采用的地质同物理探矿相结合的综合快速勘探法的经验，以加快隐蔽煤田的普查和精查；推广山西和山东省利用物理探矿方法探测水文地质的经验。
    据新华社讯　实行快速勘探，可以迅速地为工业生产部门提供更充裕的矿藏资源，是我国地质部门的一个重要工作方向。这是地质部最近在河南登封县井湾铁矿召开的快速勘探现场会议上得出的结论。
    登封县井湾铁矿是一个新发现的具有工业价值的中型矿床，地质构造比较复杂，露头比较良好，层位比较稳定。像这样的矿床，一般需要七个月到一年的勘探时间；可是河南省地质局豫零五队根据这里的具体情况，实行了快速勘探的方法，比用一般勘探方法减少了一半工程量和50％以上的投资，并且仅用四个多月的时间就提出了详细的地质勘探报告。
    井湾铁矿在勘探工作中，采取了因地制宜、分块分段的勘探法，钻孔时该稀的就稀，该密的就密，结果使钻孔量由原来设计的十三个减少到八个；由原定进二千九百公尺减少到只进一千四百五十公尺，同样控制住了储量。
    这一个队在勘探工作中还破除迷信，以连续拣块法代替了刻槽法，使效率提高五十倍以上。
