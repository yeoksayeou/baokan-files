Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd: Tibetan people from Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces have strongly denounced the treasonous crimes of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique. They pointed out that the rebel clique is the scum of the Tibetan people, wolves in religious clothing, and that only by thoroughly quelling the rebellion can the interests of the Tibetan people be truly protected.

Sangji Yexi (Tibetan), Vice Governor of Sichuan Province and Director of the Provincial Nationalities Affairs Commission, said: The upper-class reactionary clique, which has long oppressed the Tibetan people, has not changed its old ways after liberation. It colluded with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and foreign reactionaries, openly tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and launched an armed rebellion in a vain attempt to split the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities. This is absolutely intolerable to the Tibetan people and all the people of the country. The State Council's order to thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion represents the fundamental interests of all nationalities in the motherland and expresses the urgent aspirations of the vast majority of Tibetan people.

Sangji Yexi said: In the Tibetan areas of Sichuan Province, under the leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Mao, and with the vigorous assistance of the Han people, regional autonomy has been successively implemented, and various production and construction undertakings have developed rapidly. The lives of the Tibetan people have improved significantly. The broad masses of Tibetan people have personally experienced that the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government are the defenders of their interests, and they have unlimited trust and love for the Central Government and Chairman Mao. Most upper-class people, through the party's patient education and their own social practice, have gradually improved their understanding and expressed their willingness to serve the construction of the motherland and their own ethnic regions under the leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Mao. The situation in Tibet is exactly the same. Although a small handful of reactionaries shamefully sided with imperialism and betrayed the motherland, the vast working people and patriotic upper-class people of Tibet resolutely support the leadership of the Central Government and safeguard the unity of the motherland, and are able to distinguish right from wrong and differentiate between the enemy and ourselves. Therefore, the traitorous elements' sinister conspiracy will be completely crushed under the joint attack of the Tibetan people and the People's Liberation Army.

Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), Vice Governor of Gansu Province and Governor of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, pointed out that the armed rebellion launched by the majority of Kalons in the Tibetan local government and a small handful of upper-class reactionary cliques is a serious and sinful act of betraying the motherland and betraying the interests of their own nationality. He then cited the long-term suffering of national oppression experienced by the Tibetan people of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture before liberation, as well as the unprecedented development of economic and cultural undertakings and the significant improvement in the lives of people of all ethnic groups in the Gannan area after liberation. He said: From my own personal experience before and after liberation, I have deeply realized that listening to Chairman Mao's words and following the Communist Party means eternal happiness. What we need is to develop production and construction, and live and work in peace and contentment, not to destroy production and construction, and disrupt social order; what we need is revolutionary progress, not counter-revolutionary regression. Years of practice have proven a truth: only under the unified leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Mao can all minority nationalities have a bright and unlimited future.

Lamas of the Labrang Monastery, one of the six major monasteries of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan Buddhism in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, all expressed their firm support for the State Council's order at the symposium. The Jamyang Living Buddha said: The Tibetan rebellion is not at all a matter of protecting religion and national interests, but a pre-meditated counter-revolutionary armed rebellion by the Tibetan traitorous clique, supported by imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, to undermine the unity of the motherland. Only by thoroughly quelling the rebellion can the fundamental interests of the Tibetan people be truly protected. Dajie, the former Xiangzu of the monastery, and Living Buddhas Dewa Cang and Dehe Langcang said: Since liberation, under the brilliant light of the Central Government and Chairman Mao's nationalities policy, regional ethnic autonomy has been realized. In the past, transportation in the Gannan area was blocked, but now transportation is accessible in all directions. The central government sent airplanes to the grasslands to kill locusts that were harming Gannan. There were no factories in the past, but now factories are being built everywhere, including hydroelectric power plants, leather factories, machinery factories, glass factories, and the modern Gannan Dairy Factory. Animal husbandry and agriculture have also made great progress. More than 90% of school-age children here are enrolled in school, and the lives of the Tibetan people have greatly improved. Therefore, the broad masses of Tibetan people resolutely support the Central People's Government and the Communist Party, and have expressed their willingness to follow the Communist Party forever. Any rumors and provocations by imperialists and Tibetan rebel elements are futile.

In recent days, De'uru, Lintan, Taojiang and other counties and cities in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have also held forums one after another, resolutely supporting the State Council's order. Tibetan commune members Dang Ziji, Danmu Zhicao, and Gongbao Cao of the Labrang People's Commune said that the Central People's Government has done countless beneficial things for the broad masses of Tibetan people. The upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet launched an armed rebellion and betrayed the motherland, which is against the interests of the Tibetan people. We demand that this small handful of reactionary elements be thoroughly purged.

In recent days, people from the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province have held discussions, expressing their unanimous indignation at the crimes of the Tibetan traitors. Tibetan person Zhuo Jia said: The Tibetan rebel elements vainly attempt to undermine the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities with the support of imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries. Their calculations are completely wrong. The cause of unity of our great motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities cannot be undermined by anyone. The Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique launched a rebellion, and the result can only be that they dig their own graves and bury themselves.

    川甘青藏族人士声讨西藏叛国集团
    桑吉悦希、黄正清说：在共产党领导下，少数民族才有光明前途
    据新华社3日讯　四川、甘肃、青海等地藏族人士严厉声讨西藏上层反动集团的叛国罪行。他们指出：叛乱集团是藏族人民的败类，是披着宗教外衣的豺狼，只有彻底平息叛乱，才是真正保护了西藏人民的利益。
    四川省副省长、省民族事务委员会主任桑吉悦希（藏族）说：长期压迫西藏人民的上层反动集团，解放后旧恶不改，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石集团和外国反动派，公然撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，发动武装叛乱，妄图分裂祖国统一和各民族的团结，这是藏族人民和全国各族人民所绝对不能容忍的。国务院关于彻底平息西藏叛乱和解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府的命令，代表祖国各族人民的根本利益，也表达了广大藏族人民的迫切愿望。
    桑吉悦希说：四川省各个藏族地区，解放后在中央和毛主席领导下，在汉族人民的大力帮助下，先后实行了区域自治，各项生产建设事业获得迅速的发展，藏族人民的生活有了显著的改善。广大藏族人民切身体验到，中国共产党和中央人民政府是他们的利益的保卫者，他们对中央和毛主席寄予无限的信赖和热爱。大多数上层人士经过党的耐心教育和自己的社会实践，认识也逐渐有所提高，表示愿意在中央和毛主席领导下，为祖国和本民族地区的建设事业效劳。西藏的情况也正是如此。尽管一小撮反动分子可耻地投靠帝国主义，背叛祖国，但是西藏的广大劳动人民和上层爱国人士是坚决拥护中央领导、维护祖国统一的，能够明辨是非，分清敌我。因此，叛国分子的罪恶阴谋，在西藏人民和人民解放军的合力打击下，必将彻底粉碎。
    甘肃省副省长、甘南藏族自治州州长黄正清（藏族）指出西藏地方政府的多数噶伦和一小撮上层反动集团所发动的武装叛乱，是彻头彻尾背叛祖国背叛本民族利益的严重的罪恶行为。他接着举出甘南藏族自治州藏族人民解放前长期遭受民族压迫的痛苦，以及解放后甘南地区经济、文化事业得到空前发展，各族人民生活得到显著改善的情况。他说：我从解放前后的亲身经历中，深深体会到，听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，就永远是幸福。我们需要的是发展生产建设，安居乐业，绝不是破坏生产建设，破坏社会秩序；我们需要的是革命的前进，绝不是反革命的倒退。多年来的实践，证明了一条真理：只有在中央和毛主席的统一领导下，各少数民族才有光明无限的前途。
    喇嘛教黄教六大寺院之一的甘南藏族自治州拉卜楞寺院的喇嘛们，在座谈会上都表示坚决拥护国务院的命令。嘉木样活佛说：西藏叛乱根本不是什么保护宗教和民族利益问题，而是西藏的叛国集团在帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派的支持下，破坏祖国统一的、早有准备的反革命武装叛乱。只有彻底平息叛乱，才是真正保护西藏人民的根本利益。这个寺院前任襄佐达吉和活佛德娃仓、德合郎仓说：解放以来，在中央和毛主席的民族政策的光辉照耀下，实现了民族区域自治。甘南地区过去交通闭塞，现在交通四通八达。甘南蝗虫为害，中央派了飞机来草原灭蝗。过去没有工厂，现在到处办起了工厂，有水电厂、皮革厂、机械厂、玻璃厂以及现代化的甘南乳品厂等。畜牧业和农业也都有很大发展。这里90％以上的学龄儿童都入了学，藏族人民的生活有了很大改善。因而广大藏族人民坚决拥护中央人民政府和共产党，都表示永远跟着共产党走。帝国主义和西藏叛乱分子的任何造谣和挑拨，都是枉费心机。
    甘南藏族自治州的德乌鲁、临潭、洮江等县、市，连日来也纷纷举行座谈会，坚决拥护国务院的命令。拉卜楞人民公社藏族社员当子甲、旦木治草、贡保草等人说，中央人民政府对广大藏族人民做了说不清的有益的事，西藏上层反动集团发动武装叛乱，背叛祖国，就是反对藏族人民的利益，我们要求把这一小撮反动分子彻底肃清。
    青海省黄南藏族自治州人民连日座谈，对西藏叛国分子的罪行一致表示愤慨。藏族人士卓加说：西藏叛乱分子妄想在帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派的支持下，破坏祖国统一和民族团结，他们的算盘完全打错了。我们伟大祖国的统一事业和各族人民的团结，是任何人也破坏不了的。西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱，结果只能是他们自掘坟墓，自己埋葬自己。
