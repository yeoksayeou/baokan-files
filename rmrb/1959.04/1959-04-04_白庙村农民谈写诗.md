Bai Miao Village Peasants Discuss Writing Poetry

Editor's Note: The peasants of Bai Miao Village in Baqiao District, Xi'an City, have created many poems since last year, promoting production and inspiring enthusiasm for building socialism. The following short essays are all written by members of the Bai Miao Village Production Team of the Red Flag People's Commune.

	Writing Poetry Can Promote Production
			Liu Zhicheng

	I am the production team leader, and the Party tells us to do everything possible to improve production. Writing poetry is a good way to boost morale and can promote production, so I actively write poetry.

	Last spring, after hearing the report on the great leap in production, I used poetry to express my attitude to the commune members:

	We don't rely on gods or heaven,
	We rely entirely on five hundred good commune members,
	Rushing forward with all our might,
	Surpassing the Qinling Mountains and exceeding Jiangnan.

	When deep plowing, the old man Jin Shengming worked the hardest, and we immediately composed a poem for him on the spot:

	The autumn wind blows in September,
	Shengming shows his skills in plowing,
	The iron shovel waving shakes the mountains and rivers,
	Truly a hero emerges in old age.

	Everyone listened and wanted to chase after Shengming, adding strength to their hands; usually one person plowed three fen of land a day, but on this day everyone plowed five fen of land.

	Commune member Hu Wanqing, didn't like laboring, so I and several commune members collectively wrote a poem criticizing him; later he changed, and we and the commune members collectively wrote a poem praising him.

	I am not well-educated, and when I write poetry, I can think of this sentence, but not that one, so most of the poems I write are put together with the commune members, you say a sentence, I say a sentence. This has a benefit; many people have wide eyes, see comprehensively, write quickly, and have great results.

	The Honest Words of Us Two
			Jin Huilan Wang Shengcai

	In the summer, when the bumper harvest of wheat had just arrived in the field, the Party announced the general line again, truly "double happiness," making people happy to the point of wanting to jump up and down. Everyone wrote poems and sang, it was extremely lively. I discussed with Huilan and said: "Let's write one too:

	Announcing the general line, Shengcai is so happy,
	Calling out to my wife, study culture harder."

	Huilan is really capable, she rhymed with my rhyme and said:

	Announcing the general line, Huilan is even happier,
	Calling out to my husband, work harder in production."

	I don't dare call this poetry, just call it "a ditty." Once, there was a poetry competition in the village, and people were competing very lively, and we two couldn't hold back, went up and said: "We have a ditty to sing." Who knew that once it was read, everyone laughed and said "This is truly the true color of our peasants." From then on, whenever we two have free time, we give everyone two ditties.

	Don't think that our ditties are not well written, but they are all honest words. We do what we say. Our peasants are "stone rollers grinding millstones" (honest and solid), and will not just be glib.

	The Party's Kindness Can Never Be Sung Enough
					Liu Xinzhen

	I have written more than seventy poems, and someone asked me: "Why have you written so many poems?" I said: "Even if I write seven hundred, seven thousand more, I can't sing enough of the Party's kindness."

	I was a beggar since I was a child, and when I was in my twenties, I cooked for the landlord, eating a bowl of dishwater, and was still beaten and bullied all day long.

	But now? Eating free food, wearing three new clothes, last spring there was a shortage of grain, the government sent us foreign flour, and now the Party has also prepared homes for the elderly for us. The Party has trained me to be the director of the women's affairs, and I have been elected as a labor model five or six times, and many cadres affectionately call me old granny!

	The Party has warmed my heart! Illuminated it! I want to tell anyone I see about the Party's kindness; this year writing poetry has become popular here, I am also learning to write, writing and singing, and if I don't sing, I feel uncomfortable in my heart.

	Writing Poetry Boosts Enthusiasm
                  Hu Gailan

	I am a women's team leader, leading dozens of women to work in the fields. When we are tired, we write a few lines, sing a ditty, this one says a few words, that one says a few words, talking and laughing, and immediately we are not tired anymore. Sometimes listening to people writing poetry and telling stories in clapper talk, we understand many new principles and new things, and we are happy in our hearts, feeling that the more we go forward, the more hope we have. When we are happy in our hearts, our enthusiasm is even greater, we work quickly, and the quality is good.

	If you ask us why we want to write poetry, in my opinion, writing poetry is to boost enthusiasm and grow more grain; writing poetry is to be happy in our hearts.

### 白庙村农民谈写诗

    白庙村农民谈写诗
    编者按：西安市灞桥区白庙村的农民，去年以来，创作了许多诗歌，推动了生产，鼓舞了建设社会主义的热情。下面这几篇短文，都是红旗人民公社白庙村生产队的队员写的。编诗歌能推动生产刘志诚
    咱是生产队长，党叫咱想尽一切办法搞好生产。编诗是鼓舞干劲的一个好办法，能推动生产，所以咱就积极编诗。
    去年春天，刚听了生产大跃进的报告，咱就用诗向社员表示态度：
    不靠神来不靠天，
    全靠五百好社员，
    一股劲地往前赶，
    跨过秦岭超江南。
    深翻地时，金生明老汉干的最猛，我们当场就给他编了一首：
    秋风吹来九月天，
    生明翻地显手段，
    铁锨挥舞山河颤，
    真是英雄出老年。
    大家听了，都要追生明，手上加了劲；平常一人一天翻三分地，这天每人却翻了五分地。
    社员胡万庆，不爱劳动，咱和几个社员集体给他编了首批评他；后来他转变了，咱又和社员们集体编诗歌表扬他。
    咱没文化，编起诗歌来，想好了这句，想不好那句，所以咱编的诗，大多和社员在一块你一句，我一句凑出来的。这有个好处；人多眼宽，看的全面，编的快，收效也大。
    俺两口的老实话
          金惠兰　王生才
    夏天，丰收的麦子刚到场上，党又公布了总路线，真是“双喜临门”，把人高兴得走路都想蹦几下子。大家编诗歌唱，红火得不得了。我跟惠兰商量说：“咱也来一首吧：
    公布总路线，生才好喜欢，
    叫声娃他妈，加劲学文化。”
    惠兰也真能行，她押着我的韵就说：
    公布总路线，惠兰更喜欢，
    叫声娃他爸，生产加油干。
    俺不敢把这叫诗，就叫“顺口溜”。有一次村里开赛诗会，人家赛得怪热闹，俺两口也憋不住了，上去说：“咱有顺口溜溜一下子”。谁知一念出来，大家听了直笑，说“这真是咱农民的本色”。从这以后，俺两口一有空就给大家溜上两段。
    别看咱这顺口溜编得不好，可都是老实话。咱咋说就咋做。咱农民就是这“碌碡砸磨石打石”（实打实），不会光耍嘴片子。
    党的恩情唱不完
                    刘信珍
    我编了七十多首诗歌，有人问我：“你咋编了那么多的诗？”我说：“再编七百首，七千首，也唱不完党的恩情。”
    咱自小是个讨饭的，二十几岁上给地主做饭，吃一碗刷锅水，还是整天挨打受气。
    可现在呢？吃的不要钱的饭，穿的三面新的衣服，去年春天缺点粮，政府给咱送来洋面，如今党把敬老院也给咱们准备下了。党培养咱当了妇女主任，五六次选咱当劳动模范，好多干部都亲亲热热叫咱老大娘哩！
    党把咱的心暖热啦！照亮啦！咱见谁就想跟谁说党的恩情；今年咱这里兴起编诗，咱也学着编，边编边唱，不唱心里就憋的难受。
    编诗鼓干劲
                  胡改兰
  我是个妇女队长，领导几十个妇女在地里干活，干累了编上几句，顺口一溜，这个说几句，那个说几句，说说笑笑，马上就不乏了。有时听听人家编诗说快板，懂许多新道理新事情，心里高兴，觉着越往前越有奔头。心里一高兴，干劲就更大，干活快，质量好。
    要问我们为啥要编诗，依我的想法，编诗就是为了鼓足干劲，多打粮食；编诗就是心里高兴。
