Birds of a Feather

    American news agencies, in reporting Adenauer's upcoming resignation as Chancellor, were reminded of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. United Press International said: Dulles's recurrence of cancer and likely retirement made Adenauer feel that he had greatly lost all his previous support. The Associated Press lamented: "With both Adenauer and Dulles no longer actively guiding foreign affairs, the future of Western European policy seems very uncertain."

    Indeed, Dulles and Adenauer can be called a pair of birds of a feather in the Western world. One is a fire-starter on the "brink of war," and the other is the "last knight of the Cold War." According to the Associated Press: "The two men saw eye to eye on almost all matters of common concern." Moreover, it is also said that: "Colleagues saw a warm friendship and mutual trust in their relationship, a rare sentiment between two senior officials."

    However, now these two birds of a feather seem to share the same fate. Dulles is lying in bed and is said to be "unlikely to fully lead the U.S. State Department again." In response, the "Washington Evening Star" said: Dulles's "rigid" policy toward the Soviet Union is "gone forever." And Adenauer, because "his policies have gone bankrupt," has had to be "kicked upstairs" to be a president with position but no power.

    Of course, the issue is not determined by two individuals. Now, Western news agencies are still saying: regardless of whether there are Adenauer and Dulles, the West still intends to refuse to give up the occupation of West Berlin and refuse the Soviet proposal. However, Western sensitive reporters cannot help but worry from the predicament of these two people that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the West to insist on their "policy of strength," which is also reasonable.

### 难兄难弟

　　难兄难弟
    美国通讯社在报道阿登纳即将卸任总理一职时，联想到美国国务卿杜勒斯。合众国际社说：杜勒斯癌症复发而很可能退休这件事，曾使阿登纳觉得自己大大失去了以前所有的支持。美联社则哀叹：“由于阿登纳和杜勒斯都不再积极指导外交事务，西方的欧洲政策前途如何看来还非常捉摸不定”。
    的确，杜勒斯和阿登纳堪可称为西方世界中的一对难兄难弟。一个是“战争边缘”的玩火者，一个是“冷战的最后骑士”。据美联社报道：“这两人几乎对一切共同有关的问题都看法一致”。而且还据说：“同事们在他们两人的关系中看到了个人间的温暖友情和互相信任，两位高级官员之间具有这种感情是罕见的”。
    可是，现在这两位难兄难弟也似乎命运与共。杜勒斯正躺倒在病床上，而且据说“大概不会再全面领导美国国务院”。对此，“华盛顿明星晚报”说：杜勒斯的对苏联的“僵硬”政策“一去不复返了”。而阿登纳也因为“他的政策破产”不得不被“踢到楼上去”当有职无权的总统。
    当然，问题并不决定于两个个人。现在西方通讯社也仍在说：不管有没有阿登纳和杜勒斯，西方始终打算拒绝放弃对西柏林的占领，拒绝苏联的建议。但是，西方敏感的记者不免要从这两个人的处境上担心西方要坚持他们的“实力政策”已经越来越困难，这也是合乎情理的。
