Dear Comrade Political Commissar Tan:

    I think you have already received the letter that I sent through Ngapoi yesterday. I received the letter you sent this morning. The illegal actions of the reactionary clique cause me infinite sorrow. Yesterday, I notified the Kashag, ordering that the illegal People's Assembly must be dissolved immediately, and that the reactionary elements who have presumptuously entered the Norbulingka Palace in the name of protecting me must be withdrawn immediately. Regarding the serious incidents that occurred yesterday and the day before, which were created in the name of protecting my safety and which seriously alienated the relationship between the central government and the local government, I am doing everything possible to resolve them. This morning at 8:30 Beijing time, a few Tibetan troops suddenly fired several shots near the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, fortunately without causing a major disturbance. I am now planning to educate and instruct several of my subordinates.

    Please frankly let me know any instructions or opinions you have for me.

                                              Presented by the Dalai, 12th

    达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的第二封亲笔信
    达赖喇嘛3月12日给谭冠三将军的第二封亲笔信。这封信是用铅笔写的。原件长二十七公分三，宽二十一公分二。
                  全信汉文译文如下：亲爱的谭政委同志：
    昨天经阿沛转去一信，想已收到了。今早您送来的信收到了。反动集团的违法行为，使我无限忧伤。昨天我通知噶厦，责令非法的人民会议必须立即解散，以保卫我为名而狂妄地进驻罗布林卡的反动分子必须立即撤走。对于昨天、前天发生的、以保护我的安全为名而制造的严重离间中央与地方关系的事件，我正尽一切可能设法处理。今天早晨北京时间八点半钟，有少数藏军突然在青藏公路附近鸣了几枪，幸好没有发生大的骚乱。我现在正打算向下属的几个人进行教育和嘱托。
    您对我有何指示的意见，请知心坦率的示知。
                                              达赖12日呈
