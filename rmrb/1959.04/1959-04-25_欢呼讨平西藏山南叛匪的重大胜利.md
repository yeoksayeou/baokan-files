Hail the Great Victory in Suppressing the Rebel Bandits in Shannan, Tibet

The People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region troops, who were ordered to suppress the Tibetan traitorous group, having thoroughly quelled the rebellion in the Lhasa area, marched south and wiped out the old nest of the rebel bandits headed by Ngabo Ngawang Jigme in the Shannan area, achieving a new and major victory. Currently, our army has controlled the vast area south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and north of the Himalayas, as well as all the border defense key points in this area. With the active support of the local Tibetan people, we are taking advantage of the victory to mop up the scattered rebel bandits. Complete elimination is imminent. The good news has been met with jubilation throughout the country. This is good news for the Tibetan people, and also good news for all ethnic groups in the country!

The Shannan area was an important long-term stronghold for the rebel bandits. Under the direction of the original Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary group, this group of rebel bandits colluded with imperialists and foreign reactionaries to carry out rebellious activities betraying the motherland. They used the fact that this area borders foreign countries to continuously receive weapons imported from abroad and airdropped supplies from foreign planes, engaging in criminal activities such as looting property, raping, burning, killing, and harming the people. Therefore, our army's swift elimination of this group of rebel bandits and liberation of this area is of particularly great significance for accelerating the suppression of the rebellion in the Tibetan region. The scattered remnants of bandits in other remote areas of Tibet are now trapped in a jar, with no way to escape. If they do not quickly lay down their weapons and abandon the darkness to embrace the light, they will be thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminated!

For a long time, imperialists and foreign reactionaries have been single-mindedly trying to separate Tibet from the motherland's family and turn the Tibetan people into their slaves and beasts of burden. In order to seize Tibet, imperialists and foreign expansionists have been cultivating their own forces in the Tibetan ruling group and plotting the so-called "Tibetan independence" conspiracy in order to create an excuse for their further aggression against Tibet, and finally turn Tibet into their colony or "protectorate." This time, a small handful of upper-level reactionary groups in Tibet openly launched an armed rebellion, betraying the motherland, which was instigated and planned by imperialists and foreign expansionists. However, whether it is the Tibetan traitorous group or the imperialists and foreign reactionaries, they have completely miscalculated the situation in Tibet. The rapid destruction of the rebel bandits' old nest in the Shannan area is precisely the most resounding answer to the imperialists' and foreign reactionaries' conspiracy to split Tibet, given by the People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan people with practical actions. It should be warned again to the imperialists and foreign expansionists: Tibet is an inseparable part of China; any conspiracy that dares to invade Tibet will surely be shattered by the united iron fist of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. The Chinese people do not want an inch of foreign land, but they will never let others steal an inch of their own land. The rapid suppression of the rebellion in Tibet should be a beneficial lesson for the imperialists and foreign expansionists!

The great victory in suppressing the rebel bandits in the Shannan area is a fatal blow to the Tibetan traitorous group and a heavy blow to the imperialists and foreign expansionists. This victory not only greatly strengthened the cause of national unity and ethnic solidarity, but also further consolidated our country's southwest national defense and safeguarded the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty. After the People's Liberation Army entered the border defense key points, imperialists and foreign reactionaries could no longer arbitrarily send special agents and spies, smuggle arms, and enter and leave our country's borders to carry out aggressive activities as they did in the past; their hope of launching a rebellion to split China has also been completely shattered! This is, of course, a great good thing for China's security, and also a great good thing for Asian peace, and only a great bad thing for imperialists and foreign reactionaries.

In the battle to suppress the rebel bandits in the Shannan area, the People's Liberation Army received the enthusiastic support of the local Tibetan people, which was an important reason for the rapid and complete victory. Wherever the army went, the Tibetan people provided food and drink, repaired bridges and roads, and guided the People's Liberation Army to pursue and wipe out the rebel bandits. This fully shows that the Tibetan people in the Shannan area completely stand on the side of the People's Liberation Army and warmly support the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly suppressing the rebellion. The people in the Shannan area have long been in the rebel bandit control area, suffering from the exploitation of the rebel bandits and the local reactionary serf owners, and are in extreme pain. They are eager to be liberated from the abyss of darkness. Therefore, when the People's Liberation Army arrived, they celebrated their new life as if they had met their relatives, and thanked the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army for their life-saving grace, and actively assisted the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the rebel bandits. The relationship between the Tibetan people in the Shannan area and the People's Liberation Army like fish and water proves the glorious achievements of our country's ethnic policy, and also shows that the People's Liberation Army has strict military discipline and does not violate the interests of the people. It is precisely because the broad masses of local Tibetan people completely stood on the side of the People's Liberation Army, and the rebel bandits were completely isolated among the local people, that the People's Liberation Army made rapid progress, and the rebel bandits collapsed at the mere sight of them. This once again powerfully shows that the Tibetan traitorous group does not represent the Tibetan people at all. They are only a small handful of upper-level reactionary elements and are the enemies of the Tibetan people. The imperialists and foreign reactionaries are trying to describe the rebellion of a small handful of upper-level reactionary elements in Tibet who colluded with foreign countries to endanger the country and harm the people as a "national independence movement," which is the most shameless lie.

The armed rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary group in collusion with imperialists and foreign reactionaries has completely failed. The only way out for the remaining scattered bandits is to immediately lay down their weapons and strive for leniency. The government's and the People's Liberation Army's policy towards the rebels is: those who surrender their arms will be treated leniently, those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded, those who were coerced will not be questioned, and only those ringleaders who have committed heinous crimes and refuse to repent will be punished according to law. In the battle in the Shannan area, some rebel bandits fled to India, which is a dead end.

The rapid suppression of the rebellion in Tibet is another major event in the political life of our country's people. From then on, the Tibetan people will gradually get rid of their backward and dark lives and embark on the bright road of prosperity and progress. The suppression of the rebellion has paved the way for democratic reforms in Tibet and will also enable Tibet to quickly realize national regional autonomy. Now, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has exercised the functions and powers of the Tibetan local government. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will conduct full consultations with people from all walks of life in Tibet regarding the specific steps and methods for carrying out democratic reforms in Tibet. The interests of patriotic and progressive people in the upper and middle levels of Tibet will be properly taken care of. Freedom of religious belief will continue to be protected. Democratic reform is the only way for Tibet to move towards prosperity and happiness, and it will undoubtedly be warmly supported by people from all walks of life in Tibet.

Since the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet in 1951, they have done many beneficial things for the Tibetan people. They have given full play to all the fine traditions of our army, correctly implemented the various policies of the Party and the government, and have been loved by the broad masses of Tibetan people and patriotic people. In this battle to quell the rebellion, the People's Liberation Army troops bravely pursued and wiped out the rebel bandits regardless of the dangerous terrain and snow-capped mountains, and successfully completed the sacred tasks entrusted to them by the state and the people, and made contributions to the unification of the motherland and national unity. Here, we would like to pay our highest respects to all the commanders and fighters of the loyal and brave People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region troops, and wish them an early and thorough elimination of the remnants of the bandits and the consolidation of the motherland's national defense!

### 欢呼讨平西藏山南叛匪的重大胜利

    欢呼讨平西藏山南叛匪的重大胜利
    奉命讨伐西藏叛国集团的人民解放军西藏军区部队，在彻底平定了拉萨地区的叛乱之后，挥师南下，又在山南地区荡平了以恩珠仓·公布扎西为首的叛匪的老巢，取得了新的重大胜利。目前，我军已控制了雅鲁藏布江以南、喜马拉雅山以北的广大地区和这个地区的所有边境国防要点，正在当地藏族人民的积极支援下，乘胜清剿零散叛匪，不日即可彻底肃清。捷报传来，举国欢腾。这是西藏人民的福音，也是全国各族人民的福音！
    山南地区是叛匪长期盘据的一个重要老巢。这股叛匪在原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的指使下，勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，进行背叛祖国的叛乱活动。他们利用这个地区同外国接壤，不断接受从外国输入的武器和外国飞机的空投接济，进行劫掠财物、奸淫烧杀、残害人民的罪恶活动。因此，我军一举肃清这股叛匪，解放这个地区，对于加速平息西藏地区的叛乱，有着特别重大的意义。西藏其他偏僻地区的零星残匪，现在已成瓮中之鳖，无路可逃。他们如不迅速放下武器，弃暗投明，就将被彻底、干净、全部消灭！
    长期以来，帝国主义和外国反动派，一心想把西藏从祖国的大家庭中分裂出去，把西藏人民变成它们的奴隶牛马。帝国主义和外国扩张主义分子为了攫取我国的西藏，一直在西藏统治集团中培植自己的势力，策划所谓“西藏独立”的阴谋，以便为它们进一步侵略西藏制造口实，最后把西藏变为它们的殖民地或“保护国”。这次西藏一小撮上层反动集团公开发动武装叛乱，背叛祖国，就是受到帝国主义和外国扩张主义分子的唆使和策动的。但是，无论西藏叛国集团也好，无论帝国主义和外国反动派也好，它们都把西藏的局势完全估计错了。山南地区叛匪老巢的迅速复灭，正是人民解放军和西藏人民用实际的行动，对帝国主义和外国反动派分裂西藏阴谋的一个最响亮的回答。应该再一次警告帝国主义者和外国扩张主义者：西藏是中国不可分割的一部分；任何胆敢侵略西藏的阴谋，一定会在中国各族人民团结的铁拳下被打得粉碎。中国人民不要任何外国一寸土地，但是也决不让别人抢走一寸土地。西藏叛乱的迅速平息，对于帝国主义者和外国扩张主义者，都应该是一次有益的教训！
    山南地区平息叛匪的伟大胜利，是对西藏叛国集团一个致命的打击，也是对帝国主义和外国扩张主义者一个沉重的打击。这个胜利，不仅大大地加强了国家统一和民族团结的事业，并且进一步巩固了我国西南的国防，维护了我国的领土主权的完整。人民解放军进驻边境国防要点后，帝国主义和外国反动派再也不能像过去那样，任意派遣特务间谍，私运军火，进出我国国境，进行侵略活动了；他们指望发动叛乱从而分裂中国的幻想也彻底破灭了！这对于中国安全当然是大大的好事，对于亚洲和平也是大大的好事，只有对帝国主义和外国反动派是大大的坏事。
    人民解放军在平息山南地区叛匪的战斗中，得到当地藏族人民的热情支援，这是迅速获得完全胜利的重要原因。大军到处，藏族人民筚食壶浆，修桥补路，引导解放军追歼叛匪。这充分表明，山南地区藏族人民完全站在解放军一边，热烈拥护人民解放军彻底平息叛乱。山南地区人民长期处于叛匪控制地区，受着叛匪和当地反动的奴隶主的压榨，痛苦不堪，他们迫切地希望从黑暗的深渊中解放出来。因此，当人民解放军一到，他们就像遇到了亲人一样，欢庆新生，同声感激共产党和解放军为救命恩人，并积极协助解放军讨平叛匪。山南地区藏族人民同人民解放军鱼水相得的关系，证明了我国民族政策的光辉成就，也说明了人民解放军军纪严明，秋毫无犯。正是由于广大当地藏族人民完全站在人民解放军一边，而叛匪在当地人民中完全陷于孤立，所以人民解放军进展神速，叛匪则望风披靡，一触即溃。这再一次有力地表明，西藏叛国集团根本不代表西藏人民，他们只是一小撮上层反动分子，是西藏人民的敌人。帝国主义和外国反动派，力图把西藏一小撮上层反动分子里通外国、祸国殃民的叛乱，说成是什么“民族独立运动”，实在是最无耻的谎言。　
    西藏反动集团勾结帝国主义和外国反动派的武装叛乱已经彻底失败了。现在还残存的零星股匪的唯一出路是立即放下武器，争取宽大处理。政府和解放军对于叛乱分子的政策是：缴械投诚者将从宽处理，立功者将受到奖励，胁从分子不加追问，只有对那些罪大恶极、怙恶不悛的首要分子才依法惩办。在山南地区的战斗中，有些叛乱分子逃亡到印度去，那是绝路一条。
    西藏叛乱的迅速平息，是我国人民政治生活中的又一件大事。从此，西藏人民将逐步摆脱落后的黑暗的生活，走上繁荣进步的光明大道。叛乱的平息，为西藏进行民主改革铺平了道路，也将使西藏迅速实现民族区域自治。现在，西藏自治区筹备委员会已经行使西藏地方政府的职权。有关西藏进行民主改革的具体步骤和方法，西藏自治区筹备委员会将同西藏各阶层人士进行充分的协商。西藏上层和中层爱国进步人士的利益将得到适当的照顾。宗教信仰自由亦将继续受到保护。民主改革是西藏走向繁荣幸福的必由之路，无疑将获得西藏各阶层人民的热烈拥护。
    人民解放军从1951年进驻西藏以来，对西藏人民做了很多有益的事情，他们充分发挥了我军的一切优良传统，正确地执行了党和政府的各项政策，得到了西藏广大人民和爱国人士的爱戴。在这次平定叛乱的战斗中，人民解放军部队不顾地形险阻和雪山峻岭，勇猛追歼叛匪，很好地完成国家和人民付托给他们的神圣任务，为祖国统一和民族团结建立了功勋。在这里，我们谨向忠勇的人民解放军西藏军区部队的全体指挥员、战斗员同志们，致以崇高的敬意，并祝他们早日彻底肃清残匪，巩固祖国国防！
