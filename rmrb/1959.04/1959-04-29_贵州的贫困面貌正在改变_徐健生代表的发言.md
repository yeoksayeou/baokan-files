Comrades,

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports by Vice-Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen.

Now, I would like to share some thoughts on agricultural production in Guizhou.

**Vigorously Construct Water Conservancy Projects, Overcome Severe Drought, and Achieve a Bumper Grain Harvest**

Guizhou is a mountainous province. In the past, transportation was extremely inconvenient, and agricultural production was backward. Over the past few years, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, the people of Guizhou have carried out various social reforms, which has led to the rapid development of agricultural production. Especially in 1958, after the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, people of all ethnic groups overcame various difficulties and achieved a great leap forward in agricultural production, scoring tremendous victories. The total grain output reached 18 billion catties, an increase of 72% over 1957, 157% over 1952, and equivalent to three times the grain output of 1949. Calculated by the area of grain cultivated land, each mu reached more than 800 catties, completing the targets set by the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule. In order to strive for victory in grain production, we earnestly implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, taking into account the characteristics of the mountainous areas. Taking water conservancy construction as an example, we adopted a method combining large, medium, and small-scale projects and launched a massive water conservancy construction movement. In the past year, more than one million mountain ponds and reservoirs, and diversion canals of various sizes were built amidst the towering mountains. These water conservancy projects, connected ponds with canals, and canals with ponds, forming pond clusters and canal networks in many places. The water diverted and stored in this year increased nine times compared to 1957, equivalent to more than double the water diverted and stored by all the original water conservancy projects in the province; it expanded the irrigated area of farmland by more than 9 million mu. During the drought resistance movement, the masses put forward slogans such as, "Determined to produce a thousand catties per mu, our determination is higher than the sky, draining the big rivers, cutting off the barren mountains (building aqueducts on the mountainside)". In order to ensure timely sowing, the masses of Jiangnan Township in Hezhang County connected forty-eight dragon-bone waterwheels to draw water to a 69-zhang high mountain. The masses called it "Dragon connecting dragon, water reaching the sky." The soaring enthusiasm of the people and the tremendous achievements in water conservancy construction enabled the people of Guizhou to overcome last year's severe drought. Although twenty counties lacked rain for half a year last year, the province's grain production still achieved a bumper harvest.

The above-ground resources in the mountainous areas are extremely rich. Therefore, while vigorously increasing grain production, actively developing diversified operations is of particular importance to production in the mountainous areas. Last year, various parts of our province, under the premise of ensuring increased grain production, actively developed forestry, animal husbandry and sideline production, went into the mountains to explore treasures, collected mountain products, and widely carried out diversified operations. In this year, the income from diversified operations reached 1.67 billion yuan, accounting for more than 58% of the total annual income from agricultural and sideline production. Among them, native products alone accounted for about 400 million yuan. This not only greatly increased the income of the communes and improved the people's lives, but also played a significant role in increasing commune production investment and rapidly developing production.

**Develop Transportation and Solve the Shortage of Labor**

In order to develop production in mountainous areas, solving transportation is an extremely important issue. In the past, the people of Guizhou suffered greatly from traffic obstructions. Due to traffic obstructions and inconvenient transportation, many materials and local products in the mountains were left to rot and perish on the mountains, leaving people helpless. Due to traffic obstructions, people had to put a lot of manpower into transportation. According to key surveys, the labor used to transport fertilizer, grain, native products, etc., accounts for more than 50% of the total agricultural labor force. Under such circumstances, the people of Guizhou were particularly eager to develop transportation. However, it is indeed not easy to build roads in a mountainous area like Guizhou. Even building a ox-cart road often requires opening up mountains, cliffs, and precipices, requiring a great deal of manpower and material resources. Despite this, in order to develop production, they never bowed their heads in the face of difficulties. In the past year, the people of the province launched a huge road-building campaign, resulting in a great leap forward in transportation. Last year, large-scale railway construction was launched, and the Qian-Gui Railway was opened to traffic to Guiyang half a year ahead of schedule. The Qian-Chuan and Qian-Dian Railways are under construction. At the same time, a mass movement to build highways and ox-cart roads was launched in the vast rural areas. In this year, more than 6,000 kilometers of new highways (including simple highways) were built, and many cart roads and field production roads were built. The highways built in the past year are equivalent to more than three times the highways built during the First Five-Year Plan period and twice the highways built before liberation. At the same time, the province launched a cart-ization movement, developing more than 180,000 ox-carts and handcarts, greatly saving manpower. In addition, we carried out large-scale dredging of rivers, greatly developing water transportation. Now the navigable mileage of rivers in the province has reached 3,300 kilometers, of which nearly 300 kilometers are navigable for shallow-water tugboats. In the Wujiang River, Qingshui River, Duliu River, Chishui River and other rivers in our province, not only are there wooden boat transportation, but also shallow-water tugboats have appeared. The development of transportation has played a great role in promoting the development of agricultural production in mountainous areas. For example, in Zunyi County, due to the realization of a road network and cart-ization, the county saved more than 10 million labor days in one year last year. Lalin District in Dushan County originally had a 50% shortage of labor. Due to the realization of a road network and cart-ization, the tight labor situation in agricultural production has been largely resolved. It can be imagined that if there had not been a great development in transportation last year, it would have been difficult for us to achieve such great results in agricultural production.

In recent years, the development of agricultural production in Guizhou, especially the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958, has further strengthened our confidence in developing production at high speed and rapidly changing the face of mountainous areas. In 1959, we planned to increase grain production by 10 billion catties on the basis of 1958. This number can be guaranteed to be completed and overfulfilled.

**The Working People Growing Up in Poor and Backward Areas Are the Great Force for Overcoming Difficulties and Changing Poverty and Backwardness**

Some people always think that it is already extremely difficult to develop production in such poor and backward mountainous areas, so how can we talk about a great leap forward? It is true that there are many difficulties in developing production in mountainous areas. But difficulties can be overcome, and poverty and backwardness can be changed. The working people growing up in this poor and backward place are the great force for overcoming difficulties and changing poverty and backwardness. In just a few short years, they have changed the miserable life that people called "people without three cents of silver" before liberation, and turned a grain-deficient province into a grain-surplus province. Over the past few years, they have also transferred 2.7 billion catties of grain to support national construction. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, agricultural production in mountainous areas can completely overcome all production difficulties based on its favorable conditions and relying on the hands of people of all ethnic groups. We can not only have a great leap forward, but also continue to have a better great leap forward.

This year's agricultural production, due to the strengthening of agricultural production increase measures since last winter and this spring, especially the widespread deep plowing of the land, the wheat is now growing very well, and spring plowing is in full swing. We must earnestly absorb the valuable experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, carry forward our strengths, overcome our shortcomings, redouble our efforts, continue to leap forward, ensure the completion of the national grain production plan, and strive to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the national economic construction plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton.

Just as people of all ethnic groups across the country are leaping forward along the socialist road, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, under the instructions of British imperialists and Indian expansionists, betrayed the motherland, tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and launched a full-scale armed rebellion, undermining the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities. This is against the interests of the Tibetan people and the common interests of the people of all nationalities in the country. Such monstrous crimes are absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country. The State Council's order to quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the former Tibetan local government is firmly supported by people of all ethnic groups in our province, and we are very happy about the rapid suppression of the Tibetan rebellion. The so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian foreign officials on April 21 is a fabricated lie, absurd and shameless. This is entirely a conspiracy by Indian expansionists to invade Tibet, our country's territory. Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory and will never allow anyone to interfere. Any conspiracy that attempts to exploit the Tibetan rebellion to realize expansionist ambitions will be futile and will surely meet with shameful failure. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Tibetan people will surely be able to build Tibet into a democratic, socialist, prosperous and happy new Tibet.

### 贵州的贫困面貌正在改变  徐健生代表的发言

    贵州的贫困面貌正在改变
    徐健生代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    现在我就贵州的农业生产问题谈一点意见。
    大力兴修水利，战胜严重旱灾，粮食大丰收
    贵州是个山区。过去交通极为不便，农业生产落后。几年来，贵州人民在党中央、毛主席和国务院的英明领导下，进行了各项社会改革，使农业生产获得了迅速的发展。特别是一九五八年，经过整风运动和反右派斗争，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，各族人民克服了种种困难，在农业生产上出现了大跃进的局面，取得了巨大胜利。粮食总产量达到一百八十亿斤，比一九五七年增长百分之七十二，比一九五二年增长百分之一百五十七，相当于一九四九年粮食产量的三倍。按粮食耕地面积计算，每亩达到八百斤以上，提前完成了农业发展纲要所规定的指标。为了争取粮食生产上的胜利，我们根据山区特点，认真的贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”。拿兴修水利来说，我们采取大中小相结合的办法，开展了规模巨大的兴修水利运动。一年来，在丛山峻岭中，兴建了大大小小的山塘水库、引水沟渠一百多万处。这些水利，沟连塘，塘连沟，许多地方已形成了塘群沟网。这一年的引水蓄水量比一九五七年增加了九倍，等于全省原有水利工程引水蓄水量的一倍多；扩大了农田灌溉面积九百多万亩。在抗旱运动中，群众提出这样的口号“亩产千斤粮，决心比天高，车干大河水，截断荒山腰（在山腰修引水渠）”。赫章县江南乡的群众，为了使农田及时下种，曾将四十八道龙骨车连接使用，把河水引上六十九丈的高山，群众把他称为“龙接龙，水上天”。人民群众的冲天干劲和水利建设的巨大成就，使贵州人民战胜了去年的严重旱灾，去年虽有二十个县半年缺雨，全省粮食生产仍然获得了大丰收。
    山区的地上资源是极为丰富的，因此，在大力增产粮食的同时，积极发展多种经营，对山区生产具有特别重要的意义。去年我省各地，在保证粮食增产的前提下，积极发展林业、牧畜业和副业生产，上山探宝，采集山货，广泛的开展了多种经营。这一年，多种经营的收入达十六点七亿元，占全年农副业总收入的百分之五十八以上。其中仅土特产品一项就占四亿元左右。这不仅大大增加了公社收入，改善了人民生活，并且对增加公社生产投资，迅速发展生产，起了很大的作用。
    发展交通运输事业，解决劳动力的不足
    为了发展山区生产，解决交通运输是一个极为重要的问题。过去贵州人民吃尽了交通闭塞的苦头。由于交通闭塞，运输不便，山区许多物资和土特产品在山上自生自灭，任其“货弃于地”，无可奈何。由于交通闭塞，人们不得不拿出大量的人力投入运输。据重点调查，每年用在运送肥料、粮食、土特产品等的劳力，占整个农业用工数的百分之五十以上。在这种情况下，贵州人民要求发展交通事业的心情，就特别迫切。但是，在像贵州这样一个山区里，去修筑道路，确不容易。就是修一条牛马车道，往往要开山辟岭，打通悬岩峭壁，付出很大的人力和物力。尽管如此，为了发展生产，他们从未在困难面前低头。在去年一年中，全省人民掀起了一个巨大的修路运动，使交通运输事业获得了飞跃的发展。去年大规模的铁路建设展开了，黔桂铁路提前半年通车到了贵阳，川黔、滇黔铁路正在加紧施工。同时，在广大农村开展了修筑公路和牛马车道的群众运动。这一年新修筑公路（包括简易公路）六千多公里，修了很多大车道和田间生产道路。去年一年修筑的公路，相当于第一个五年计划期间所修公路的三倍以上，相当于解放前所有公路的两倍。与此同时，全省开展了一个车子化运动，发展了牛马车和手推车十八万多部，大大的节省了人力。另外，我们对河道进行了大规模的疏浚工作，大大发展了水上运输。现在全省河流的通航里程已达三千三百公里，其中浅水拖轮航道近三百公里。在我省乌江、清水江、都柳江、赤水河等河流中，不仅有木船运输，而且已出现了浅水拖轮航行。交通运输事业的发展，对于促进山区农业生产的发展，起了很大作用。如遵义县由于实现了道路网、车子化，去年一年全县就节约劳动日一千万个以上。独山县拉林区，原来缺劳力百分之五十，由于实现了道路网、车子化，农业生产上劳动力紧张的情况，大部分得到解决。可以设想，如果去年没有交通运输事业的大发展，我们在农业生产上，要取得这样大的成绩是困难的。
    几年来，贵州农业生产的发展，特别是一九五八年农业生产的大跃进，进一步坚定了我们高速度地发展生产，迅速改变山区面貌的信心。一九五九年，我们计划，粮食产量在一九五八年的基础上增产一百亿斤。这个数字是可以保证完成和超额完成的。
    生长在贫困落后地方的劳动人民，就是战胜困难、改变贫苦落后的伟大力量
    有些人总以为，在这样贫穷落后的山区发展生产，已经是困难重重，还能够谈得上大跃进吗？不错，山区发展生产困难是不少的。但困难是可以克服的，贫困落后是可以改变的。生长在这个贫困落后地方的劳动人民，就是战胜困难、改变贫困落后的伟大力量。短短的几年间，他们就把解放前人们称为“人无三分银”的悲惨生活改变了，把一个缺粮省变成一个余粮省，几年来还调出了二十七亿斤粮食，支援国家建设。我们坚信：在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，山区的农业生产，根据它的有利条件，依靠各族人民的双手，是完全可以战胜生产上的一切困难的，我们不仅可以大跃进，而且可以继续更好的大跃进。
    今年的农业生产，由于去冬今春加强了农业增产措施，特别是广泛的深翻了土地，现在小麦生长很好，春耕正在紧张进行。我们要认真地吸取去年大跃进的宝贵经验，发扬优点，克服缺点，鼓足干劲，继续跃进，保证完成国家粮食生产计划，为保证完成和超额完成以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的国家经济建设计划而努力。
    正当全国各族人民沿着社会主义道路飞跃前进的时候，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，竟在英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的指使下，背叛祖国，撕毁和平解放西藏的十七条协议，发动了全面的武装叛乱，破坏祖国的统一和各民族的团结，这是违反西藏人民的利益和全国各民族人民的共同利益的，这种滔天罪行是全国人民绝对不能容忍的。国务院关于平息西藏叛乱，解散原西藏地方政府的命令，我省各族人民坚决拥护，并为西藏叛乱的迅速平定而感到十分高兴。四月二十一日由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，是一个谎话连篇，荒谬无耻的捏造，这完全是印度扩张主义分子侵略我国领土西藏的阴谋。西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，绝不容许任何人干涉，任何想利用西藏叛乱事件实现扩张野心的阴谋，都是枉费心机的，一定遭到可耻的失败。我们深信，西藏人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，一定能够把西藏建设成为一个民主的、社会主义的、繁荣幸福的新西藏。
