Comrades Representatives:

I fully agree with the reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I will resolutely implement them. Now, I will make the following speech on the railway construction situation in Guizhou.

Guizhou is a mountainous area with very rich resources, possessing the natural conditions necessary for industrialization. However, before liberation, under feudal separatism and reactionary rule, transportation was blocked, rich resources could not be developed and utilized, production was backward, and the people's lives were very impoverished. After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, industrial and agricultural production has developed rapidly, and the situation of transportation blockage has also been greatly improved. In 1958, all aspects of work in Guizhou achieved great victories. Railway construction in Guizhou was no exception and also achieved great results. Railway workers, commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps, and tens of thousands of civilian laborers, under the correct leadership of the Party and under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, liberated their minds, broke superstitions, and were full of vigor. With a high degree of enthusiasm for the construction of the motherland and with the heroic spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas, they launched a struggle against all difficulties. They boldly proposed: Leveling the Miaoling and Loushan Mountains, vowing to turn the plateau into a plain! For the sake of the overall leap forward, they successively put forward more than 90,000 rationalization proposals, vigorously improved construction methods and improved tools, and created and used more than 200 types of small machinery, more than 10,000 pieces, resulting in many high-yield records. Among them, the more prominent ones are: completing the 150-meter-long Muzhu River Bridge in 22 days; completing the two-span 16-meter-long Zhangjiashan Middle Bridge in 14 days; repairing a bridge culvert in eight hours, all with qualified quality; opening the lower pilot tunnel of the Xiaoshuicun Tunnel, which is 229 meters long, in ten days and fourteen hours, and then opening the upper pilot tunnel of this tunnel in thirty-two hours; for the Loushan Pass Tunnel, mechanical excavation and enlargement progressed 222 meters per day, and mechanical excavation of the pilot tunnel of the Xiazi River Tunnel progressed 303 meters per month at each end. In order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient materials and machinery, in the fourth quarter of last year, the road construction workers smelted steel, manufactured machine tools, produced cement, explosives, and other materials, meeting the needs of some projects. Through last year's efforts, not only did the Sichuan-Guizhou and Yunnan-Guizhou trunk lines and the Guiqing, Duji Xiao, and other major branch lines make great progress, laying the foundation for early track laying and opening to traffic, but more importantly, the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway was opened to traffic half a year ahead of schedule and reached Guiyang, and immediately handled passenger and freight transportation, reaching all parts of the country, turning heavy mountains and steep ridges into a smooth road. The long-cherished wish of the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou has finally been realized under the leadership of the Party. The completion of this railway has an important role in further developing Guizhou's industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups and road construction workers and soldiers jubilantly celebrated the full opening of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway. They said: Looking forward for a thousand years, looking forward for ten thousand years, the great improvement of human carrying and horse transportation, the post station becomes a railway station, and the people in the mountainous areas are all happy. Reversing the universe and transforming the sky, steel is laid in the clouds. It is not that we have great powers, but that the power of the Party is boundless.

The full opening of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway is only the beginning of completely changing the blocked transportation situation in Guizhou. It is far from being able to meet the needs of the development of industrial and agricultural production in the province. The task of railway construction in front of us is still very arduous and heavy, and we must make greater efforts. At present, we should consider concentrating our efforts on strengthening the open-to-traffic sections, expanding the Guiyang hub station, building special lines for major factories and mines, and constructing the Yunnan-Guizhou and Sichuan-Guizhou new trunk lines, especially the early completion of the Yunnan-Guizhou Road, which is of great significance for developing the Qianxi large coalfield and solving coking coal for steelmaking. In order to further improve labor productivity and accelerate the speed of railway construction, the following four issues should be noted:

First, continue to exert great effort, liberate thinking, boldly adopt new technologies and new methods, and implement comprehensive and rapid construction to adapt to the new situation of the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

The construction team of Guizhou Railway has greatly improved its technical level in the construction of bridges and tunnels through years, especially the practice of 1958. This makes it possible, under certain natural conditions, to shorten the route by adopting long tunnels and large-span high bridges, reducing the difficulty of foundation construction and reducing labor-intensive work. In order to make long tunnels and large-span high bridges not too technically complicated, it is best to first select the location of the controlling bridges and tunnels when selecting the route, and then select the route between the control points. The use of long tunnels and high bridges may also increase earthwork in some cases, which requires further adoption of "one large (i.e., advanced large-scale blasting method), one small (i.e., extensive use of small machinery), and fast circulation (i.e., close coordination of main processes such as excavation, transportation, filling, and compaction)" technical measures to save labor, improve labor productivity, shorten the construction period, and reduce costs. Guizhou Railway Project is arduous and complex. As long as we boldly adopt new technologies and new methods, we will be able to overcome all objectively existing difficulties and achieve comprehensive and rapid construction.

Second, implement the policy of combining foreign and local methods and using large, medium, and small equipment simultaneously to improve the degree of mechanized construction.

Mechanized construction is the direction of development. Under the current situation of temporary shortage of construction machinery and poor transportation conditions, the implementation of the policy of "combining foreign and local methods and using large, medium, and small equipment simultaneously" can make mechanized construction develop rapidly. Foreign equipment is good, but sometimes local equipment is also good. For example, the ladder counter-plate automatically transports the excavated soil from a steep slope of 60 to 70 meters high, car by car, to the foot of the mountain for filling the roadbed. This is difficult for large foreign machines to do. For example, small machinery such as hydraulic winch slope vehicles, winch cableways, derricks, and water-lifting vehicles can generally increase work efficiency by more than ten times. Some people praised: "Small machinery uses hydraulic power, just like rockets pulling airplanes. Sitting on a chair to control the switch, see if you are comfortable or not." These small machines are simple to manufacture, requiring only some ordinary wood, bamboo, wire nails, and a small amount of lead wire, without steel. It is the simplest, most realistic, and problem-solving method. What's wrong with that? In terms of bridge and tunnel engineering, if only large machinery is used, only one or several processes can be mechanized. Only by combining foreign and local methods and using large, medium, and small equipment simultaneously can comprehensive and comprehensive mechanized construction be achieved. Therefore, to further improve the degree of mechanized construction at the current stage, we should, on the one hand, make full use of existing large and medium-sized machinery, and on the other hand, develop local and small-sized machinery as much as possible and implement the policy of "combining foreign and local methods and using large, medium, and small equipment simultaneously." In this way, we can advance mechanized construction without asking the state for a large number of machines and raw materials.

Third, based on the principle of self-reliance, manufacture raw materials and machinery ourselves to alleviate the difficulty of insufficient supply.

Last year, the principle of self-reliance has already blossomed and borne fruit in Guizhou's railway construction work. Since last winter, railway workers have smelted 414 tons of steel themselves, manufactured 129 machine tools and machines, produced 1,467 tons of cement, 134 tons of explosives, and other building materials, and supplied them to meet the urgent needs of some projects in a timely manner, while equipping themselves. For example, the 16th Operation Team started with two pairs of pliers. By adopting the method of "ants gnawing at bones," it developed into a team-owned repair shop with three machine tools, one welding machine, and a charcoal furnace-driven generator within half a year. The above facts show that as long as we implement the principle of self-reliance, we can go from nothing to something, from less to more, and from small local groups to large foreign groups. Under the current situation of tight supply of materials and machinery, we should continue to manufacture some equipment and raw materials that can be manufactured on the basis of existing equipment in order to solve some urgent needs of railway construction.

Fourth, in the process of labor production, pay attention to cultivating technical forces and strengthening the construction team.

The technical proficiency of production workers is very important for the level of labor productivity. Taking the Guiyang Railway Bureau as an example, in the first quarter of this year, civilian workers accounted for 89.95% of the total labor force. The bureau's overall labor productivity gradually increased with the improvement of the technical level of civilian workers. For example, if January is set as 100, February is 150, and March is 204. At the end of the first quarter of this year, a large number of laborers were transferred to agricultural production, which did not have a major impact. Rapid construction requires everyone to be versatile, so cultivating technical forces has become an urgent task. To solve this problem, some grassroots construction units have implemented the method of taking the factory as a school and the school as a factory. This is a good way to closely combine the cultivation of technical forces with labor production.

We firmly believe that as long as we rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously carry out mass movements centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, and advance victoriously with an attitude of overcoming all difficulties and determination to achieve victory, we will be able to further accelerate the speed of railway construction in Guizhou and ensure the completion of the national economic plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton.

The above speech is not appropriate, please criticize and correct it.

    万水千山只等闲　要使铁路上九天
    刘建熙代表谈贵州省的铁路建设各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长分别作的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。现在我就贵州铁路建设的情况作如下发言。
    贵州是个山区，资源非常丰富，具备着工业化所需要的自然条件。但是解放前，在封建割据和反动统治下，交通闭塞，丰富的资源得不到开发和利用，生产落后，人民生活非常贫困。解放后，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，工农业生产有了迅速的发展，交通闭塞状况也有很大的改善。一九五八年贵州各方面的工作都取得了伟大的胜利，贵州的铁路建设没有例外，也取得了很大的成绩。铁路职工、铁道部队指战员和成千上万的民工，在党的正确领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，解放了思想，破除了迷信，干劲冲天。他们怀着对祖国建设的高度热情，以移山倒海的英雄气概，向一切困难展开斗争，他们豪迈的提出：削平苗岭娄山，誓把高原变平川！为了全面跃进，他们先后提出合理化建议达九万多件，大力改进施工方法和改良工具，创造和使用了小型机械二百多种，一万多件，出现了不少高产记录。其中比较突出的如：以二十二天完成一百五十公尺长的木竹河大桥；十四天完成两孔十六公尺长的张家山中桥；八小时修好一座桥涵，质量都合要求；十天零十四小时打通全长二百二十九公尺的小水村隧道的下导坑，接着又以三十二小时打通这座隧道的上导坑；娄山关隧道，机械开挖扩大日进二百二十二公尺，虾子河隧道机械开挖导坑，每端月进三百零三公尺等。为了战胜材料、机具不足的困难，在去年四季度，筑路职工炼出了钢铁，制造了机床，生产了水泥、炸药和其他材料，满足了一部分工程的需要。经过去年的努力，不仅川黔、滇黔两条干线和贵清、都鸡小等主要支线的工程，获得很大的进展，为提早铺轨通车奠定了基础，更重要的是黔桂铁路提前半年通车到达了贵阳，并立即办理了客货运，通达全国，变重山峻岭为千里坦途，贵州各族人民多年来的愿望在党的领导下终于实现了。这条铁路的建成，对进一步发展贵州的工农业生产有着重要作用。因此各族人民和筑路工人与战士，欢欣鼓舞的庆贺黔桂铁路的全线通车，他们说：千年盼，万年盼，人背马驮大改善，驿站变成火车站，山区人民个个欢。扭转乾坤改造天，钢铁铺进云里边，不是我们神通广，党的力量大无边。
    黔桂铁路的全线通车，仅仅是彻底改变贵州交通闭塞状况的开始，它还远远不能适应全省工农业生产发展的需要，摆在我们面前的铁路建设任务，仍然是很艰巨而繁重的，我们必须作出更大的努力。目前应考虑把力量集中于通车地段的加强，贵阳枢纽站的扩充，主要厂矿专用线的修建，以及滇黔、川黔两条新建干线的施工，特别是提前修通滇黔路对开发黔西大煤田，解决炼钢焦煤有着重大意义。为了进一步提高劳动生产率，加快铁路建设的速度，应注意以下四个问题：
    一，继续鼓足干劲，解放思想，大胆采用新技术、新方法，实行全面快速施工，以适应工农业生产飞跃发展的新形势。
    贵州铁路的施工队伍，经过多年特别是一九五八年的实践，修建桥梁隧道的技术水平，已经大大提高，这就有可能在一定自然条件下，以多采用长隧道和大跨度高桥的办法，来缩短路线，减少基础施工的困难和减少耗费劳动力比较多的工作。为了使长隧道和大跨度高桥在技术上不过于复杂，选线时最好先选择具有控制性的桥梁隧道的位置，然后再选择各控制点间的路线。长隧高桥的采用，也可能在某种情况下增加土石方工程，这就需要进一步在施工方法上采用“一大（即先进的大量爆破法）、一小（即广泛地使用小型机械）、快循环（即挖、运、填夯等主要工序密切配合）”的技术措施，以节约劳动力，提高劳动生产率，缩短工期，降低成本。贵州铁路工程是艰巨复杂的，只要我们大胆采用新技术、新方法，就一定能够战胜一切客观存在的困难，实现全面的快速施工。
    二，贯彻洋土结合，大中小并用的方针，提高机械化施工程度。
    施工机械化是发展的方向，在当前施工机械暂时缺乏和交通运输条件差的情况下，贯彻执行“洋土结合，大中小并用”的方针，能使机械化施工迅速的发展起来。洋的很好，但是有时，土的同样好，比如梯台反板，把开挖出来的土，从六、七十公尺高的陡坡上，一车一车自动运到山脚，用以填筑路堤，这是大型洋机器所难办到的。又如利用水力带动的绞坡车、绞坡索道、扒杆、绞水车等小型机械，一般均能提高工效十倍以上。有的人赞扬说：“小型机械用水力，好比火箭拉飞机，坐上椅子管开关，你看安逸不安逸”。这些小型机械制造简单，只需要一些普通的木料、竹子、洋钉和少量铅丝，用不着钢材，它是最简单最现实并且又解决问题的办法，这有啥不好呢？而在桥梁隧道工程方面，如果单用大型机械，只能使一个或几个工序机械化，只有洋土结合，大中小并用，才能做到全面的综合的机械化施工。因此在现阶段进一步提高机械化施工程度，应该一方面充分利用现有大中型机械，另一方面要尽可能发展土的和小型的机械，贯彻“洋土结合，大中小并用”的方针。这样就可以在不伸手向国家要大批机械和原材料的条件下，把施工机械化向前推进一步。
    三，本着自力更生的方针，自制原材料和机具，减轻供应不足的困难。
    去年，自力更生的方针已经在贵州的铁路建设工作中开花结果。去冬以来，铁路职工，自己炼出钢铁四百一十四吨，制造了机床和机械一百二十九台，生产了水泥一千四百六十七吨，炸药一百三十四吨，以及其他建筑材料，及时供应了部分工程的紧急需要，同时装备了自己。如十六作业队以两把老虎钳子起家，由于采取“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，在半年内，发展成长了一个具有三台机床，一台电焊机和一台木炭炉带动的发电机的队属修配所。上述事实说明，只要贯彻自力更生方针，就可以从无到有，从少到多，从小土群到大洋群。在当前材料机具供应紧张的情况下，应自己在现有设备的基础上，继续制造一些可能制造的设备和原材料，以解决铁路建设方面某些急需物资。
    四，在劳动生产过程中，注意培养技术力量，壮大施工队伍。
    生产工人的技术熟练程度对劳动生产率的高低有很重要的关系。以贵阳铁路局为例，今年一季度里，民工占全部劳动力的百分之八十九点九五，全局劳动生产率随着民工技术水平的提高而逐渐增长，如以元月份为一百，二月份即为一百五十，三月份为二百零四，今年一季度末，抽调大批劳动力投入农业生产，也没有大的影响。而快速施工要求人人都是多面手，因而培养技术力量就成为当前紧急任务。解决这个问题的办法，有的基层施工单位实行了以工厂为学校，以学校为工厂的办法，这是一个把培养技术力量同劳动生产紧密结合的好办法。
    我们深信，只要依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，以压倒一切困难、决心获取胜利的姿态，乘胜前进，就一定能够进一步加快贵州铁路建设的速度，保证国家以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的国民经济计划的完成。
    以上发言，不妥之处，请批评指正。
