Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Conakry: The emergency meeting of the General Affairs Committee of the All-African People's Conference issued a declaration at its closing in Conakry on the 17th, calling on Africans, Asians, and all religious leaders worldwide to condemn the "outrageous brutality of the Central African Federation (especially Nyasaland) and the authorities of the Belgian Congo."

The declaration stated that after listening to the reports made by the representatives of Nyasaland, Southern Rhodesia, the Belgian Congo, and Cameroon, the meeting was "shocked and horrified. The meeting declares its solidarity with the imprisoned and exiled brothers and comrades and demands their immediate release."

The declaration called for financial and moral assistance to the people of Nyasaland and the Belgian Congo.

The declaration denounced the "slanderous remarks" of the colonial countries attacking the All-African People's Conference. It pointed out that the lies about the leaders of the Nyasaland African National Congress attempting to carry out a massacre were "fabricated by those whose hands are stained with the blood of black martyrs fighting for freedom."

The declaration called on the African people to pay attention to and be vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism. It said, "As warned by a resolution of the Accra Conference, as long as there is a foothold of imperialism on this African continent, the freedom and security of every independent African country will still face the threat of aggression."

The declaration said, "The situation requires us to be constantly careful and vigilant. The conspiracies and subversive activities carried out by imperialism to damage the credibility of independent African countries and disrupt their tranquility and security must be exposed: this is an integral part of the predetermined plan of those colonial countries to keep Africa divided and weak."

The declaration also called on the member states of the United Nations to "issue a clear and decisive statement on whether they unconditionally support the legitimate aspirations of African freedom fighters for self-determination and independence."

It said, "Those who do not stand with us in this critical time will be considered not only as enemies of the various ethnic groups in the African colonies but also as enemies of the independent African countries."

The emergency meeting of the General Affairs Committee of the All-African People's Conference began on the 15th and lasted for three days. Representatives from Ghana, Guinea, Nyasaland, Southern Rhodesia, the Belgian Congo, French Cameroon, Togo, Basutoland, Ethiopia, Liberia, and other countries and regions attended the meeting.

    新华社18日讯　科纳克里消息：全非人民大会总务委员会紧急会议17日在科纳克里闭幕的时候发表宣言，呼吁非洲人、亚洲人和全世界所有的宗教界领袖遣责“中非联邦（特别是尼亚萨兰）和比属刚果当局的放肆的残暴行为”。
    宣言说，会议在听取了尼亚萨兰、南罗得西亚、比属刚果和喀麦隆的代表们所作的报告后，“感到震惊和毛骨悚然。会议声明，它同被监禁和被放逐的弟兄和同伴们团结一致，并且要求立即把他们释放”。
    宣言呼吁给予尼亚萨兰和比属刚果人民以财政和道义上的援助。
    宣言斥责了殖民国家攻击全非人民大会的“诬蔑性言论”。并且指出，关于尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会领袖们企图进行大屠杀的谎言是“那些双手沾满争取自由的黑人烈士的鲜血的人们所捏造的”。
    这项宣言要求非洲人民注意和警惕帝国主义的阴谋。它说，“正像阿克拉会议的一项决议所告诫的那样，只要在这个非洲大陆上还存在着帝国主义的一个据点，那么每一个非洲独立国家的自由和安全就仍然面临着侵略的威胁”。
    宣言说，“局势要求我们随时小心提防和提高警惕。帝国主义为了损害非洲独立国家的信誉和破坏它们的平静和安全而进行的阴谋诡计和颠复活动必须加以揭穿：这是那些殖民国家为了使非洲保持分裂和软弱状况的预定计划的一个组成部分”。
    这项宣言还要求联合国各会员国“发表一篇明确而果断的声明它们是否无条件地支持非洲自由战士们要求自决和独立的合法愿望”。
    它说，“那些在这个危急的时候不和我们站在一起的人们，将不仅被认为是非洲殖民地各族人民的敌人，而且也是非洲独立国家的敌人”。
    全非人民大会总务委员会这次紧急会议是在15日开始的，一共举行了三天。参加会议的有加纳、几内亚、尼亚萨兰、南罗得西亚、比属刚果、法属喀麦隆、多哥、巴苏陀兰、埃塞俄比亚和利比里亚等国家和地区的代表。
