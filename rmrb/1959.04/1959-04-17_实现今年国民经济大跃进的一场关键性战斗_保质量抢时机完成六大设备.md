The representatives of Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant, Boiler Plant, and Steam Turbine Plant proposed to ensure the completion of the manufacturing task of 1.5 million kilowatts of power generation equipment with guaranteed quality, quantity, and on schedule, and proposed that the labor productivity of the three plants should be increased by 45%-50% compared with last year, raw materials should be saved by 15%, and comparable product costs should be reduced by 15%. The representatives of Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant, Boiler Plant, and Steam Turbine Plant proposed that in order to resolutely complete the electric motor manufacturing task, labor productivity should be increased by 30%-44%, and at the same time, the cost should be reduced by 10%-15% on the premise of ensuring product quality. Representatives from Shanghai Mining Machinery Plant, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Changsha Water Pump Factory, and Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory all proposed to resolutely ensure the completion of the six major equipments on schedule, with guaranteed quality and quantity.

The various machinery factories manufacturing supporting products also put forward challenges and response conditions at the meeting, resolutely ensuring that the supporting products related to the six major equipments should be completed on schedule, with guaranteed quality and quantity. Xiangtan Electrical Machinery Plant proposed that the main motors, auxiliary motors, main motor control equipment, and supporting switch components for rolling mills they produce should all be completed before the end of May. The representative of Shanghai Dihua Instrument Factory proposed that they would guarantee to provide automated equipment for the boiler units of 220 large and medium-sized power stations, and at the same time, provide 4,500 automatic recording electronic instruments for thermal equipment such as smelting, steel rolling, coking, and heavy machinery, and strive to "ensure the instruments keep up with the main engine when it leaves the factory."

While proposing challenge and response conditions, each machinery factory also put forward specific measures to realize the competition conditions, so that the plan can be truly implemented. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant, Boiler Plant, Steam Turbine Plant, Xiangtan Electrical Machinery Plant and other units all proposed to carry out the "Thousand-Hour" Red Flag competition movement, vigorously engage in technological revolution and technological innovation to solve the shortage of mechanical equipment, especially the weak large-scale casting and forging capacity and the insufficient large-scale parts processing capacity. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant also proposed to arrange the production cycle chart, blank material supply progress chart, and processing progress chart for each set and item of the six major equipment products, and also establish a daily inspection system. Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant will increase the production capacity of hydraulic presses by 70%. Changsha Water Pump Factory will strengthen management, focus on the quarterly plan, hold a daily scheduling meeting, announce the results daily, conduct complete set inspections every other day, make a small summary every ten days, and conduct a monthly evaluation, so as to achieve a long-term plan with short-term arrangements, a large-scale plan with small-scale arrangements, focusing on key breakthroughs, and balanced production.
