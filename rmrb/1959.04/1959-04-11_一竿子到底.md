　　One Pole to the End
　　(Abstract of a commentary from the Shanghai "Liberation" No. 7)
    Shanghai's industrial production achieved a major victory in the first quarter, and a vigorous mass production movement has arrived. However, the development of the movement is uneven across different units. Some units, using the method of "one pole to the end," directly present the state's policies and tasks to the masses, and fully absorb the wisdom and experience of the masses. In such units, the measures are concrete, the key points are grasped, and both cadres and the masses feel grounded and clear about their goals. As a result, they are full of energy and enthusiasm, and a new atmosphere immediately emerges in production. Some units, although they have pushed the policies and tasks to the masses, have done so through layers of transmission, with dilutions and deductions along the way. The mobilization of the masses is neither broad, deep, nor detailed, and the wisdom and experience of the masses have not been fully utilized. Consequently, although there are measures, they are not specific; although there is an attempt to grasp the key points, the key points are not prominent. In such units, the cadres do not feel grounded, they waver, and the enthusiasm of the masses cannot be fully unleashed. Therefore, although the movement has begun, it is not progressing quickly. There are also a very few units where policies, tasks, plans, targets, etc., remain within the small circle of a few leading cadres, closing the door to calculations, or arranging execution after a decision is made by a few cadres. The enthusiasm of the masses is suppressed. Such units can only be cold and deserted.
    Only by explaining the state's policies and tasks and various planned targets to the masses clearly, so that they are understood and accepted by the masses, can they be mastered by the masses and generate enormous material strength. The correctness of the enterprise's planned targets and measures can only be verified by listening to the opinions of the masses and through mass practice. Therefore, no matter when, no matter what task we are completing, we must sincerely and humbly consult with the masses, listen attentively to their opinions, enlighten their consciousness, and promote their initiative.
    Bringing the state's policies and tasks directly to the masses is not only a process of implementing the state's policies and tasks, but also a process of organizing a high tide of production. The masses are most concerned about production and are also most familiar with production. When they discuss the state's policies and tasks, discuss the plans, targets, and measures of their enterprises, it will stir up a wave of free airing of views, deep debates, and multi-faceted clashes of opinions. Only then can problems be exposed and truth be found. On this basis, the targets and measures can be implemented reliably, key points can be broken through, and a genuine mass production campaign can be formed.
    Bringing the state's policies and tasks directly to the masses is conducive to raising the consciousness of the masses and to overcoming subjectivism in leadership. If we consult with the masses earnestly and with the spirit of being a willing pupil, they will further feel that you have entrusted your heart to them, and are breathing the same air as them, thereby further encouraging their enthusiasm to accelerate the construction of socialism. The opinions of the masses are of course diverse. In free discussion, the masses will compare various different opinions, engage in debate, and truth becomes clearer through debate. Correct opinions become more substantial and complete in the discussion and are affirmed; incorrect opinions are gradually abandoned by the masses in the discussion. Therefore, the process of discussion is a process of continuous improvement in the consciousness of the masses. For our comrades, only after listening to all kinds of opinions, and after analysis and comparison, can we discover problems, grasp the key points; only then can we implement policies and execute tasks more comprehensively and correctly, and correctly reflect the demands of the masses and reflect objective reality.
    "One pole to the end" is an important method for combining leadership with the masses, and also an important method for implementing the Party's mass line. Whether or not this can be done is a question of whether or not we believe in the masses, and a question of whether or not we can adhere to the historical materialist viewpoint.

　　一竿子到底
　　（上海“解放”第七期评论摘要）
    上海第一季度工业生产取得了重大胜利，一个蓬蓬勃勃的群众性生产运动已经到来。但就每个单位来说，运动发展的情况还不平衡。有的单位，用一竿子到底的办法，把国家的方针、任务直接同群众见面，并充分地吸取了群众的智慧和经验。这样的单位，措施就订得具体、抓得住关键，干部和群众都感到心中落实、目标明确，于是干劲十足，热气腾腾，生产上立即出现新的气象。有的单位，方针、任务虽已推向群众，但层层下达，七折八扣，发动群众面既不广又不深不细，群众的智慧和经验也没有充分集中起来；因而虽有措施，但不具体；想抓关键，关键不突出。在这样的单位里，干部心中不落实，摇摇晃晃，群众干劲不能充分发挥，因而，运动虽已展开，但进展不快。还有极少数的单位，方针、任务、计划、指标等等，还停留在领导干部少数人的小圈圈内，关门算帐，或者少数几个干部决定后就布置执行。群众的干劲，受到压制。这样的单位，只能是冷冷清清。
    只有把国家的方针、任务，各项计划指标，向群众讲得清清楚楚，为群众所了解、接受，才能为群众所掌握，才能产生巨大的物质力量。而企业的计划指标、措施的正确与否，也只有倾听群众的意见，在群众实践中得到检验。所以，无论在什么时候，无论完成什么任务，我们都要真诚地、谦逊地同群众商量，虚心倾听群众意见，启发他们的自觉，发扬他们的积极性。
    把国家的方针任务直接同群众见面，不但是贯彻执行国家的方针任务的过程，同时，又是组织生产高潮的过程。群众是最关心生产的，也是最熟悉生产的。他们讨论国家的方针任务，讨论本企业的计划、指标、措施，这样，就会掀起鸣放热潮，争辩深透，多面交锋，问题才能暴露，真理才能找到。在这个基础上，指标措施才能落实可靠，关键才能攻破，真正的群众性生产大运动才能形成。
    把国家的方针、任务直接同群众见面，既有利于提高群众的觉悟，又有利于克服领导上的主观主义。我们以甘当小学生的精神，认真地同群众商量，他们就会进一步感到你是把心交给了他们，和他们呼吸相通，从而也就更加鼓舞了他们加速建设社会主义的积极性。群众的意见当然是各种各样的，在自由讨论中，群众才会把各种不同的意见，加以比较，展开争论，而真理是愈辩愈明的。正确的意见，在讨论中，更加充实、完整，并得到肯定；不正确的意见，在讨论中，也逐渐为群众所抛弃。所以，讨论的过程，也就是群众觉悟不断提高的过程。对我们的同志来说，只有听取了各种各样的意见后，经过分析、比较，才能发现问题，抓住关键；贯彻政策，执行任务，才能更全面、更正确，才能正确地反映群众的要求，反映客观实际。
    一竿子到底，是领导和群众相结合的重要方法，也是贯彻党的群众路线的重要方法。能不能这样做，就是相信不相信群众的问题，能否坚持历史唯物主义观点的问题。
