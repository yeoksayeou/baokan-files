Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 6th. Hafunga, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, delivered a speech condemning the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique for colluding with imperialists, gathering rebel bandits, abducting the Dalai Lama, tearing up the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and launching an armed rebellion. He said: This kind of behavior, betraying the motherland, betraying the interests of the Tibetan people, undermining the unity of the motherland, and undermining national unity, is absolutely intolerable to the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, including the Tibetan people, and the people of the whole country.

Hafunga said: The State Council issued an order to dissolve the Tibetan local government, decided that the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region should exercise the functions and powers of the Tibetan local government, and ordered the troops of the Tibet Military Region to thoroughly quell the rebellion. This is entirely in line with the interests of safeguarding the unity of the motherland and national unity, and it is also entirely in line with the fundamental interests of the Tibetan people. The nine million people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region firmly support this.

Hafunga said: Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the central government has consistently adhered to the spirit of national unity and national equality, and has strived to promote the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities and the unity within the Tibetan nationality. In the specific implementation of the agreement, it has patiently waited for the awakening of the upper-class elements in Tibet. However, the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet, representing the interests of the reactionary big serf owners, actually regarded the central government's patient waiting and magnanimous attitude as weakness and launched an armed rebellion in broad daylight. Now, the troops of the Tibet Military Region are rapidly quelling the rebellion, and the rebel group will be thoroughly eliminated. This is a great happy event for the Tibetan people and a victory for all ethnic groups in the country.

Hafunga said: Before liberation, the people of Inner Mongolia suffered greatly from the oppression of imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, and the reactionary ruling class within the nation. They also experienced a dark, impoverished, and backward era similar to that of the Tibetan people. Only after receiving the leadership and assistance of the Central People's Government did they get rid of their painful fate. Moreover, they achieved national regional autonomy several years ago. The people of Inner Mongolia have truly become masters of their own affairs, and their economy and culture have been developed unprecedentedly. The policy of freedom of religious belief has been implemented. The people of all ethnic groups are united together like brothers, and are advancing to build a great socialist motherland and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Hafunga said: The historical experience of the people of Inner Mongolia, from darkness to light and from backwardness to progress, fully proves that only under the leadership of the central government and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the Han people, can all ethnic groups in China achieve thorough national liberation and prosperous development. This is the only correct path. We are confident that the Tibetan rebel group will be thoroughly eliminated, and that the Tibetan people, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's great national policy, will surely embark on the road to prosperity and happiness smoothly.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot. In recent days, Buddhist figures in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have held successive gatherings to angrily denounce the towering crimes of the Tibetan reactionary elements in betraying the country. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch of the Buddhist Association of China issued a statement supporting the State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion. All the lamas and monks and nuns in Hohhot, the capital of the Autonomous Region, also unanimously passed a letter of denunciation against the Tibetan rebel group.

Gala Huidan Bizha Lasen Living Buddha (Mongolian), President of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Buddhist Association and member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said at the meeting that the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet is not only a traitor to our motherland and a disgrace to the Tibetan people, but also a jackal in religious clothing. These rebellious elements who undermine the unity of the motherland and national unity should be resolutely eliminated. Guo Ding, executive director of the Inner Mongolia Buddhist Association, and Mongolian Grand Lama Suodeba both pointed out that this group of rebellious elements are counter-revolutionaries in religious clothing, and they have completely violated Buddhist precepts. We demand that the government eliminate them.

The statement of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch of the Buddhist Association of China on supporting the State Council's order said: We, the Buddhist figures in Inner Mongolia, resolutely draw a clear line with this small handful of scum who are wearing the cloak of nationality and religion, and under the leadership of the Party, we will fight to the end to strengthen the unity of the motherland and national unity.

In the letter of denunciation against the Tibetan rebel group, all the lamas and monks and nuns in various temples in Hohhot City said: We resolutely denounce this small handful of traitors to the motherland, scum of the nation, and jackals in religious clothing. We must firmly stand on the position of anti-imperialism, patriotism, and taking the socialist road, and resolutely fight against these traitors together with the Tibetan people.

    内蒙古自治区副主席哈丰阿就西藏事件发表谈话
    平定西藏叛乱是全国各族人民的胜利
    内蒙古佛教界人士声讨西藏叛国分子的滔天罪行
    本报呼和浩特6日电　内蒙古自治区副主席哈丰阿发表谈话，谴责西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义，纠集叛匪，劫持达赖喇嘛，撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，发动武装叛乱的罪行。他说：这种背叛祖国、背叛西藏人民利益、破坏祖国统一、破坏民族团结的行为，是内蒙古各族人民同全国人民包括西藏人民在内所绝对不能容许的。
    哈丰阿说：国务院发布命令解散西藏地方政府，决定由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府职权，并命令西藏军区部队彻底平定叛乱。这完全符合维护祖国统一、民族团结的利益，也完全符合西藏人民的根本利益。内蒙古自治区九百万各族人民坚决拥护。
    哈丰阿说：从和平解放西藏以来，中央一贯坚持民族团结、民族平等的精神，努力促进汉藏民族的团结和藏族内部的团结，并在具体执行协议当中，耐心等待西藏上层分子的觉悟。但是，代表着反动的大农奴主利益的西藏上层反动集团，竟把中央的耐心等待和宽大为怀的态度看作软弱可欺，公然发动武装叛乱。现在，西藏军区部队正在迅速平定叛乱，叛乱集团将被彻底消灭，这是西藏人民的大喜事，也是全国各族人民的胜利。
    哈丰阿说：内蒙古人民在解放前备受帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮以及民族内部反动统治阶级的压迫，也经历过和西藏人民类似的黑暗、贫苦和落后的时代。自从得到中央人民政府的领导和帮助之后，才摆脱了痛苦的命运，而且在几年以前就实现了民族区域自治。内蒙古人民已经真正当家作主，经济、文化得到了空前发展，宗教信仰自由政策得到了贯彻。各族人民兄弟般地团结在一起，正为建设伟大的社会主义祖国和内蒙古自治区而前进着。
    哈丰阿说：内蒙古人民从黑暗到光明、从落后到进步的历史体验，充分证明中国各族人民只有在中央和毛主席领导之下，在汉族人民帮助之下，才能得到民族的彻底解放和繁荣发展。这是唯一的正确道路。我们确信，西藏叛乱集团将遭到彻底消灭，而西藏人民在党的伟大民族政策的光辉照耀下，一定能够顺利地走上繁荣幸福的道路。
    新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区佛教界人士最近几天来连续举行集会，愤怒声讨西藏反动分子叛国的滔天罪行。中国佛教协会内蒙古自治区分会发表了关于拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府、彻底平息西藏叛乱的命令的声明。自治区首府呼和浩特市全体喇嘛和僧尼也一致通过了对西藏叛乱集团的声讨书。
    内蒙古自治区佛教协会会长、全国政协委员嘎拉侩丹毕扎拉森活佛（蒙古族）在集会上说，西藏上层反动集团不仅是我们祖国的叛徒、藏族人民的败类，也是披着宗教外衣的豺狼。应当坚决消灭这些破坏祖国统一和民族团结的叛乱分子。内蒙古佛教协会常务理事果定和蒙古族大喇嘛索德巴都指出：这批叛乱分子是披着宗教外衣的反革命分子，他们完全违背了佛教教规。我们要求政府把他们肃清。
    中国佛教协会内蒙古自治区分会关于拥护国务院命令的声明说：我们内蒙古佛教界人士坚决与西藏这一小撮披着民族和宗教外衣的败类划清界线，在党的领导下，为加强祖国统一和民族团结而奋斗到底。
    呼和浩特市各召庙全体喇嘛和僧尼在对西藏叛乱集团的声讨书中说：我们坚决声讨这一小撮祖国的叛徒、民族的败类和披着宗教外衣的豺狼。我们一定要站稳反帝、爱国和走社会主义道路的立场，坚决与西藏人民一道向这些叛国分子进行斗争。
