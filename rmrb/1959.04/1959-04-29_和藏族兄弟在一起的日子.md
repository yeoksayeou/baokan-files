Days with Tibetan Brothers
Geng Yufang

	Spring in Tibet, the sky is high and the air is crisp;
	Summer in Tibet, mild and pleasant;
	Autumn in Tibet, harvesting highland barley;
	Winter in Tibet, big winds and dust flying.
Beneath the high, cold snow-capped mountains, in the warm Yarlung Tsangpo River valley, on the vast grasslands, in the scattered villages, live one million two hundred thousand hardworking and simple Tibetan compatriots. I have visited many of their homes, I have lived in their tents. I have sat around the stove with them, telling stories, I have ridden horses with them in the high mountains and valleys. I have a deep friendship with them, they are like my brothers and sisters. I have also fallen in love with the plateau, singing of it as my own home.

When I first arrived in Tibet, I found all the Tibetan customs very fresh, and I was eager to inquire about everything. Tibetan friends were also very enthusiastic, always trying to satisfy my requests. What they knew, they would tell me without reservation, and what they didn't know, they would ask others to clarify and then pass on to me.

Once, an old Tibetan man advised me to make a Tibetan robe, and I said with good reason: "The sleeves of Tibetan robes are long and baggy, which is very inconvenient!" The old man laughed and said, "Comrade, you don't understand the characteristics of the plateau! Here, it's cold in the morning and evening, so you wear the robe to keep warm; at noon, when the sun shines, it gets hot, so you take off the two sleeves and tie them around your waist, which is very flexible; at night, you cover yourself with it, which is extremely warm."

I remember it was a holiday when a Tibetan friend said, "You come to Tibet to learn Tibetan language and script, and you will serve our Tibetan people in the future. We welcome you! You also need to understand some Tibetan life! So, today, please come to our house for an internship!" I and several classmates happily went to his house as guests. He said, "Today we will eat tsampa and drink butter tea. This is a common meal in Tibetan families." "There's a technique to eating tsampa. In a wooden bowl, put a certain amount of butter tea and tsampa, not too much or too little, and stir it with two fingers to mix the tsampa and butter tea together, making a tsampa ball like eating a steamed bun. You still need to learn this skill!"

Butter tea is made from three vegetarian ingredients: butter, tea, and salt. Butter is extracted from milk, with one pound of butter extracted from every five pounds of milk. When making tea, there is a slender tea churn made of copper hoops and wooden boards. The large ones are taller than a person, and the small ones are three feet high. In addition, there is also a tea churning stick. It is said that it can also help you keep out the cold!

After some days, I went to the Tibetan countryside. The first time I cooked myself, I burned yak dung; next to the stove was a leather bag with a windpipe installed. Strangely enough, when yak dung burned, the fire blazed brightly, with little smoke and no smell; when the leather bag was pressed, the wind was strong, and the fire burned even more vigorously. It was very convenient for boiling tea and cooking. Therefore, we called yak dung "plateau coal" and gave the leather bag the elegant name "earth bellows."

I really like the Tibetan mountain countryside. The farmers are very hospitable, and they often invite me to drink highland barley wine. Highland barley wine is not spicy or bitter, a little sour and sweet, like drinking soda. A half-cup in one gulp, two bowls at a time, not only will you not feel dizzy, but you will feel refreshed.

Tibet is full of herds of yaks. The yak is the main livestock of the Tibetan people on the plateau. Fierce winds can't stop it; heavy snow can't freeze it. It lives stubbornly like the pine trees in the mountains. The male yak, with its majestic body and horns like bows, has great strength. They are the transportation team of the plateau, lining up like a train without tracks, crossing mountains and ridges, snow can't obscure their direction, water can't block their path. They always quietly trek long distances. The female yak provides people with the whitest and most fragrant milk. The butter made from it is the most popular.

In the rushing rivers, waves crash against the stones, sometimes passing through narrow mountain streams, where the waves are like raging tigers and wolves. But the Tibetan people have created a kind of yak-hide boat that floats down the river, unbreakable by rocks. The boat can carry as much as five or six thousand pounds of supplies, and the boatmen can steer the hide boat with only two wooden oars! When the boatmen are tired, they can put down the two oars and let the hide boat float freely on the water like a seagull; when encountering rapids, they sing rhythmic boat songs and quickly pass through safely. I took a yak-hide boat from Lhatse to Shigatse for five days, and enjoyed the scenery on both sides of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. Sometimes I saw flocks of mallards, sometimes I saw tall white cranes, sometimes I saw yellow rapeseed flowers, and sometimes I saw cattle and sheep peacefully grazing on the green grassland.

The Spring Festival of 1957. I lived in a white tent. Tibetan friends like to sleep outdoors very much, so they pitch their tents in the *lingka* (park), considering it a great pleasure. I heard this song:

	The meadow is so open,
	With white tents pitched.
	The tent door opens to the east,
	Facing the rising sun;
	The tent's white cloth is snow-white,
	Reflecting the sun's light;
	The tent poles are straight,
	That is red sandalwood;
	The tent ropes are strong,
	Han three-strand silk thread;
	The top of the tent is high,
	Connected to the sky;
	The bottom of the tent is deep,
	Reaching the yellow springs of the earth's core;
	The tent is equipped with precious cushions,
	Where my companions sit.

Although my tent was not as comfortable as the one sung in the song; at that time, the tents of the Tibetan brothers were not as beautiful; but with people's labor and the progress of Tibet, the day when the beautiful scenery in the song becomes even more ideal must come.

Another impression that was deeply etched in my mind about Tibet was the lives of Tibetan working women. They grow up in wind and snow, and labor has tempered their bodies. Their hands can turn the soil, chop firewood, harvest crops, and build houses. Their two legs can climb mountains and run. They can all ride horses, running across the grasslands like well-trained cavalry.

In the summer of 1957, my companions and I reluctantly said goodbye to our Tibetan brothers. The Tibetan brothers placed snow-white *khata* (ceremonial scarves) around our necks, wishing us a safe journey.

How fast! In the blink of an eye, two years have passed. Those happy days and sweet memories that I spent with my Tibetan brothers, some have become historical relics. For example, cars have replaced yak transport teams; coal has replaced yak dung; rice and white flour are as welcome as *tsampa*, especially today, after the upper-class reactionary group that betrayed the motherland and the Tibetan people has been eliminated, Tibetan history has entered a new page. I look forward to the call of the motherland, to join the ranks of the Tibetan brothers in revolution and construction once again, and dedicate my youth to the new Tibet of the motherland.

### 和藏族兄弟在一起的日子

    和藏族兄弟在一起的日子
    耿予方
    春天的西藏，天高气爽；
    夏天的西藏，温和舒畅；
    秋天的西藏，收割青稞；
    冬天的西藏，风大土扬。
    在那高寒的雪山下面，在那温暖的雅鲁藏布江河谷，在那辽阔的草原上，在那星罗棋布的溪卡里，住着勤劳、朴实的一百二十万藏族同胞。我拜访过他们的许多家庭，我住过他们的帐篷。我曾和他们围着火炉促膝讲故事，我曾和他们一同骑马奔驰在高山河谷里。我和他们有着深厚的友情，他们好比是我的兄弟姊妹。我也爱上了高原，当做自己的家乡来歌唱它。
    我刚到西藏，对藏族的一切风俗习惯都感到挺新鲜，什么都好打听。藏族朋友也很热情，总是设法满足我的要求。自己知道的当然毫无保留的告诉我，不知道的也向别人问清楚后再转告我。
    一次，有位藏族老大爷劝我做一件藏袍，我满有理由地说：“藏袍袖子长，又肥大，多不方便呀！”老大爷哈哈大笑起来：“同志，你不懂高原的特点吧！在我们这里，早上晚上冷，把袍子穿好，就不怕冷；中午太阳一晒，热了，把两个袖子一脱，束在腰带上，行动很灵活；夜晚，把它盖在身上，暖和极了。”
    记得是一个假日，一个藏族朋友说：“你们来到西藏学藏语藏文，将来为我们藏族服务，我们欢迎你们哟！你们也要懂一些藏族生活呀！那么，今天，请到我们家里实习实习吧！”我便和几个同学高兴地到他的家去作客。他说：“今天咱们吃糌粑，喝酥油茶。这是藏族的家常便饭。”“吃糌粑还有技术呢，在木碗里，放上一定的酥油茶和糌粑，不能多不能少，用两个指头一搅，把糌粑和酥油茶调在一起，合成糌粑团就像吃馒头一样。这一手你们还要学习一下呢！”
    酥油茶是酥油、茶、盐三种素料做成的。酥油是从牛奶里提出来的，每五斤牛奶提炼一斤酥油。打茶时，有一个细长的铜箍木板制成的茶桶，大的比一个人还高，小的也有三尺高，此外，还有一根打茶棍。据说还能帮助你御寒呢！
    过了一些日子，我到了西藏的农村。第一次自己做饭，烧的是牛粪；灶旁有一个安着风管的皮口袋。说也怪，牛粪烧起来，火光熊熊，没有多少烟，也没有什么气味；皮口袋一压，风力很大，火更旺了。烧茶做菜，十分方便。因此我们便把牛粪叫做“高原煤”，还给皮口袋起了个雅号叫“土风箱”。
    我很喜欢西藏山里的农村。农民们都很好客，他们常请我喝青稞酒。青稞酒不辣不苦，有点酸里带甜，像喝汽水一样，一口喝半杯，一次喝两碗，不但不会感到头晕，反而觉得精神抖擞。
    西藏，满山遍野都是牦牛群。牦牛是高原上藏胞的主要家畜。狂风，挡不住它；大雪，冻不坏它。它像山上的松树一样，顽强的生活着。公牦牛，魁伟的身体，长着像弓一样的双角，力气特大。它们是高原的运输队，排起队来就像一列无轨的列车，翻山越岭，雪迷不住方向，水挡不住道路。它们总是静静地长途跋涉着。母牦牛，供给人们最白最香的牛奶。做成的酥油，是最受人们欢迎的。
    在那湍急的江河里，波浪冲击着石子乱翻，有时经过狭窄的山涧，浪头像暴跳的虎狼一样。但是藏族人民制造了一种牛皮船，在河里顺流而下，石头碰不破。满船物资足有五、六千斤，船手只用两条木桨，就能指挥着皮船前进！船手累了，可以把两个桨一放，像海鸥一样地在水面让皮船自由地漂去；遇到急浪，唱着有节奏的船歌，很快的就安全渡过。我从拉孜到日喀则，坐了五天牛皮船，饱尝了雅鲁藏布江两岸的风光。有时看到成群的黄鸭，有时看到高大的白鹤，有时看到黄色的菜子花，有时看到青翠的草地上，牛羊正在安闲的吃草。
    1957年的新春。我住在一架白色的帐篷里。藏族朋友非常喜欢露宿，因而把帐篷撑在林卡里，当作极大的乐事。我听见这样的一只歌：
    草坪多么坦荡，
    架有白色蓬帐。
    帐门开在东边，
    迎着初升太阳；
    帐篷白布雪白，
    映着太阳发光；
    帐篷撑杆笔直，
    那是红色檀香；
    帐篷拴绳坚固，
    汉族三股丝线；
    帐篷高高顶端，
    和天连成一片；
    帐篷下方很深，
    直入地心黄泉；
    帐篷设有宝垫，
    坐着我的伙伴。
    虽然我的帐篷没有歌子里所唱的那样舒适；当时藏族兄弟的帐篷也没有那样漂亮；但是随着人们的劳动，西藏的进展，比歌唱的美景更加理想的一天一定要到来的。
    在西藏留给我最深刻的另一个印象，要算藏族劳动妇女的生活了。她们从小在风雪里长大，劳动锻炼了她们的身体。她们的双手能翻地，能砍柴，能割庄稼，能盖房子。她们的两条腿，能爬山，能跑路。她们个个都会骑马，在草原上跑起来就像是久经训练的骑兵。
    1957年夏天，我和我的同伴们怀着恋恋不舍的心情告别了藏族兄弟。藏族兄弟们把雪白的哈达挂在我们的脖子上，祝福我们一路平安。
    多么快啊！转瞬两年过去了。我和藏族兄弟一起度过的那些欢乐日子和甜蜜的记忆，有的已成为历史的陈迹。例如汽车代替了牦牛运输队；煤炭代替了牛粪；大米白面和糌粑同样受到欢迎，特别是今天，在背叛祖国、背叛西藏人民的上层反动集团被消灭以后，西藏的历史已进入新的一页。我盼望着祖国的召唤，再一次加入藏族兄弟革命和建设的行列中，把我的青春献给祖国的新西藏。
