Apprentice Notes
    Wang Zanying

    I'm learning the trade from Master Yu at the glass factory. People always say, "Little Yingzi is lucky to have found such a good master." When I hear that, I feel incredibly happy.

    On my first day at work, a bellyful of joy was dampened considerably. My master wasn't as kind and enthusiastic as I had imagined. Instead, he was an old stubborn head: a thick Shandong accent that could knock you against a wall, even more pungent than the smell of his dry tobacco.

    But, to be honest, I was fascinated by my master's good skills. He could blow all kinds of glass objects, exquisite to the extreme.

    As soon as I arrived, my master sent me to the annealing oven, and lectured me with a long string of instructions: "In our line of work, the heat is of utmost importance: too high, no good; too low, also no good..." I didn't even hear half of it. I muttered to myself, "What's so skillful about it? It's just burning fire, who can't do that?"

    Disbelief in words quickly came to light. Once I added too much coal, which suppressed the fire, ruining a lot of work. Seeing the displeased look on my master's face, my heart felt like a little rabbit had been stuffed inside, jumping wildly. I thought to myself, I'm definitely going to get a "dressing down." Unexpectedly, the master didn't get angry, he just said, "You're still young, you won't gain wisdom without experiencing things. But you have to remember what price you paid for this lesson." These unexpected words made my face burn, more unpleasant than being scolded.

    More than a month passed. I still hadn't left the small furnace. I didn't care about the smoke and fire, because I wasn't like the kind of person the master described, "who would even put a plaster on a flea if it stubbed its toe." But how great it would be to learn glass blowing. What's the point of just stoking the furnace!

    I couldn't hold back, and indirectly told my master my thoughts. This really ignited the master's fire: "Oh, so you're tired of it, thinking this way and that, how can you learn the trade!" He gripped a long pipe tightly, puffing incessantly on his dry tobacco.

    After a while, the master spoke again, asking me some unrelated questions: "Little Yingzi, when you were in school, you studied first grade first, then second grade, right?" "Uh-huh," I nodded.

    "Why didn't you go to middle school right away? Learning the trade is the same principle, you have to take it step by step. Stoking the small furnace is like reading the first volume. Come on, I'll test you: you've stoked the small furnace for over a month, do you know how many bars are in the furnace?" I was immediately embarrassed and couldn't answer. The master chuckled, "Ha, you failed this course, how can you move up?" I muttered, "What's the use of knowing that?" "What's the use? Is using the same amount of bars for firing pieces and firing surfaces okay? Think about that principle. Don't underestimate this work, stoking the fire isn't simple either, you have to have the patience of taking care of a child." Whether it was because I was wrong or because of my temper, I cried, crying very aggrievedly.

    "Ha, can't take it anymore? Well, I do have a cannon-like temper... But, let me make it clear first, I'll still be giving you a dressing down in the future. As the saying goes, 'Jade must be cut and polished to become a useful object'."

    "If I were to say to you like this," the master pretended to be gentle, "'Comrade Little Yingzi, please add some coal to the small furnace, okay?' – what kind of talk is that!" With tears still on my cheeks, I couldn't help but laugh. My master is so much like my deceased father, a good person with a cold face and a warm heart!

    徒工手记
    王赞莺
    我在玻璃厂跟于师傅学艺。人家都说：“小莺子这姑娘好运气呵，认了个好师傅。”我听了，心里那个美劲就甭提了。
    上工头一天，一肚子的高兴，给消了一大半。我的师傅不是我想像的那样亲切热火，却是个老倔头：一口粗重的山东音，出口能把人撞到南墙上去，比他冒的那股旱烟味还呛人。
    不过，说实在的，我倒挺着迷师傅那把好手艺。他能吹出各式各样玻璃活儿，精巧极了。
    我一来，师傅就派我去烧烤炉，还跟我絮絮叨叨交代了一大堆：“干咱这行，火候顶要紧：大，不行；小，也不中……”我连一半也没听进去。心里嘀咕：“这有什么巧处，烧火呗，谁不会。”
    不信话，真就现了眼。有一次煤添多了，压住了火，废了好些活儿。一见师傅满脸不快的神色，心就像塞进了个小兔子，蹦蹦直跳。暗想，一定要挨顿“搕”。不料师傅倒没发火，只是说：“还年青呀，不经一事，不长一智。不过可得记住，这是用什么代价换来的。”这句意外的话，说得我面上热辣辣的，比挨顿骂还难过。
    一个多月过去了。我还是没离开小炉。烟熏火燎我不在乎，因为我不是像师傅说的那号人“连虱子蹬一脚，也得粘帖膏药”，可是，学学吹玻璃有多好。光烧炉子，有啥意思！
    我沉不住了，拐弯抹角跟师傅讲出我的想法。这下师傅可真动火了：“噢，原来你是干腻了，干这样想那样，还能学艺！”他紧握着一杆长烟袋，不停地“叭哒”着旱烟。
    过了一阵，师傅才又开腔，对我提了些不相干的问题：“小莺子，你上学的时候先念一年级，后念二年级，对吧？”“嗯”我点点头。
  “怎么不一开头就上中学？学艺跟这是一理，得一步一步来。烧小炉好比念第一册，来，我考考你看：你烧了月把小炉，知道炉条有几根？”我一下子窘住了，答不出。师傅咯咯地笑了，“哈，这门课不及格，就要升级啦？”我嘟嘟嚷嚷说：“知道这顶啥用？”“顶啥用？烧块儿和烧面儿用一般多炉条行吗？你想想这个道道。别小瞧这营生，烧火也不简单，要拿出带孩子的耐心才行哩。”不知是由于理屈还是小性子，我哭了，哭得很委屈。
      “哈，受不住啦？也是，我这个炮筒子脾气……不过，得先讲清楚，往后还断不了搕你，俗话说得好，玉不琢不成器”。
      “如果我这样跟你说，”师傅装做柔声柔气地“小莺同志，请您给小炉添点煤，可以吗？——这像什么话！”泪珠还挂在腮上，我又禁不住笑了出来。我的师傅多像我死去的父亲，一位冷面孔、热心肠的好人呵！
