    Galloping on the Road of Innovation
    Zhang Huaji Group Continues to Advance, Completing Fourteen Months of Work in Three Months
    Li Xueyi Team Guarantees Early Completion of Task with One Person Doing the Work of Twenty
    (Our newspaper, Changchun, 1st dispatch) The Zhang Huaji group of the forging and riveting workshop of the Jilin Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory, after completing ten months of work in two and a half months, had completed fourteen months and nine days of work by March 31.
    After completing ten months of work, the group proposed a struggle target of completing the whole year's workload by the end of March. In order to realize this plan, the Zhang Huaji group held four meetings, and the members expressed that they would not slack off, would not be arrogant, and would continue to work hard to create greater achievements. The group also put forward the slogan of diligently studying, using both hands and brains, learning and creating, and successively realized fourteen major technical reforms, and production efficiency increased by ten to twenty-three times respectively. When making the diesel engine box cover seat, they adopted the method of doing, thinking, and working at the same time, achieving innovation in every product and improvement in every process. For example, when processing diesel engine box clips, milling machines were used for drilling in the past, and two people could process about 260 pieces a day. After changing to punching with a punch drill, one person can process more than 2,600 pieces a day, and labor efficiency has increased by nearly twenty times.
    In order to fully tap potential and solve the difficulty of insufficient labor, the group recently changed the labor organization according to production needs. Originally, four people assembled complete diesel engine boxes and could only assemble eight a day. Now, two people assemble fourteen a day.
    From January to March 25, the Zhang Huaji group completed a total of forty-two major technical reforms, enabling the mechanization of eighty-four manual operation processes. All eight workers in the group had inventions, and everyone had creations. By March 31, they had completed fourteen months and nine days of work. The group not only excellently completed the national plan, but also made full use of waste materials and saved raw materials under the premise of ensuring product quality. Over the years, they have maintained excellent product quality, and all of the more than 1.9 million parts they produced were qualified and never returned for repair.
    The group has revised its original plan to complete twenty-nine months of work in one year, and proposed a greater leap forward plan to complete thirty-nine months of work this year.
    According to the Harbin Daily, Li Xueyi, the captain of the cement team of the Second Construction Engineering Company of Harbin, and his entire team of workers are guaranteeing the early completion of this year's engineering tasks at a rate of one person doing the work of twenty.
    In the process of changing the concrete mixing equipment, the cement team humbly learned from foreign experience. After dozens of days and nights of hard work, they finally used the machine tool of the waste water pump and the principle of ash inlet and ash outlet of the single-barrel pressure grouting machine to trial-produce a double-barrel pressure pump that has a higher construction efficiency than a concrete mixer, and the work efficiency has increased by twenty times.
    With the double-cylinder pressure pump, wood templates, nails, and scaffolding are not needed in the concrete mixing process, and the front desk transportation and back desk feeding processes are also eliminated, which greatly improves labor productivity. After the team used this double-cylinder pressure pump for construction, the amount of concrete mixing increased from 40 cubic meters completed by 40 people per day to 300 cubic meters completed by 15 people per day. If calculated according to the previous construction method, the current 15 people complete the workload that required 300 people in the past. Under the conditions of construction, they can pour 18,000 cubic meters of concrete every day. With the successful trial production and promotion of the new equipment, they also adjusted the labor organization accordingly. The past five processes, operated by forty people, are now changed to three processes, operated by fifteen people, who respectively operate the machine, transport sand, and pour ash for mixing, saving twenty-five people from the previous labor force, accounting for 75% of the total number of people in the team.
    Recently, everyone in the team is eager to try, and everyone is full of fighting spirit. They also proposed to complete the annual construction task in six months.

    在革新的道路上奔驰
    张化吉组继续前进三个月干了十四个月的活
    李学义队一人顶二十人保证提前完成任务
    本报长春1日电　吉林省农业机械厂锻铆车间张化吉小组继两个半月完成十个月的工作量以后，到3月31日，又完成了十四个月零九天的工作量。
    这个小组在完成了十个月的工作量以后，即提出到3月末完成全年工作量的奋斗目标。为了实现这个计划，张化吉小组先后召开了四次会议，组员们纷纷表示不松劲，不骄傲，继续努力，创造出更大的成绩来。小组还提出了刻苦钻研，动手又动脑，学习又创造的口号，接连又实现了十四项重大技术改革，生产效率又分别提高了十倍到二十三倍。在做柴油机箱盖坐盖的时候，采取了边做、边想、边干的方法，做到了件件产品有革新，道道工序有改进。如加工柴油机箱卡子，过去用铣床钻孔，两个人一天能加工二百六十个左右。改用冲孔钻冲孔以后，一个人一天能加工二千六百多个，劳动效率提高了近二十倍。
    为了充分挖掘潜力，解决劳动力不足的困难，这个小组最近又根据生产需要改变了劳动组织。原来四个人做整装柴油机箱，一天只能装八个，现在改用两个人一天就整装十四个。
    从1月到3月25日，张化吉小组共实现了四十二项重大的技术改革，使八十四道手工操作工序实现了机械化。做到了全组八个工人，人人有发明，个个有创造。到3月31日，完成了十四个月零九天的工作量。这个小组不仅出色地完成了国家计划，而且还在保证产品质量的前提下，充分利用废旧物资，节约原材料。几年来，一直保持了产品质量优良，他们生产的一百九十多万个部件。件件合格，从来没退回返修的。
    这个小组已修订了原来一年完成二十九个月工作量的计划，提出今年要完成三十九个月工作量的更大跃进计划。
    据哈尔滨日报消息　哈尔滨市第二建筑工程公司水泥队队长李学义和他的全队工人，正以一个人干二十个人的活的速度，保证提前完成今年的工程任务。
    这个水泥队在改变混凝土搅拌设备的过程中，虚心地学习了外地经验，经过几十个昼夜的刻苦钻研，终于利用废抽水机的机床和根据单筒压力灌浆器的进灰、出灰的原理，试制成了一台比混凝土搅拌机的施工效率还高的双筒压力泵，工作效率提高了二十倍。
    有了双筒压力泵，在混凝土搅拌过程中，可不用木模板、钉子和脚手架，还取消了前台运输和后台上料等工序，因而大大提高了劳动生产率。这个队用这台双筒压力泵进行施工以后，混凝土搅拌量由过去四十个人每天完成四十立方公尺提高到十五个人每天完成三百立方公尺。如果按照过去的施工方法计算，现在每天十五个人便完成了过去需要三百人才能完成的工作量。在施工条件具备的情况下，他们每天可浇灌混凝土一万八千立方公尺。随着新设备的试制成功和推广，他们还相应地调整了劳动组织，由过去五道工序、四十个人操作，现改为三道工序十五个人分别操纵机器、运砂子、倒灰搅拌，较过去节省劳动力二十五人，占他们全队总人数的75％。
    最近这个队人人磨拳擦掌，个个斗志昂扬，又提出要用六个月的时间完成全年施工任务。
