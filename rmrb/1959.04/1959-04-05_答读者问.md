    Answering Readers' Questions
    Question: Since the pinyin alphabet is mainly used to help eliminate illiteracy, consolidate and expand the results of literacy campaigns, and help promote Mandarin Chinese, is it unnecessary for non-illiterate people and those who can speak Mandarin to learn the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet?
    Answer: It is true that non-illiterate people do not need to rely on the pinyin alphabet to recognize commonly used Chinese characters. However, the number of Chinese characters is as high as thirty to forty thousand, and five to six thousand are commonly used in newspapers and periodicals. Not to mention the non-illiterate who have just "shed illiteracy" and only know a thousand or two commonly used characters, even intellectuals with a higher level of education often forget how to write characters, forget the pronunciation of characters, or mispronounce characters. If they learn the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet, these difficulties can be easily solved by using dictionaries with pinyin annotations. For those who can speak Mandarin, the most convenient way to make their Mandarin more authentic and easier to understand is to rely on reading materials and dictionaries with Hanyu Pinyin annotations, checking and correcting themselves at any time.
    In addition, the application of the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet in science and technology, and even in daily life, is becoming more and more extensive. Learning the pinyin alphabet will increase many conveniences.
    More importantly, in the current movement of cultural revolution and technological revolution, every intellectual should do their part to eliminate illiteracy and promote Mandarin Chinese. To most effectively shoulder this responsibility, they must skillfully master the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet.
    Therefore, from whatever aspect, it cannot be said that it is unnecessary for non-illiterate people and those who can speak Mandarin to learn the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet.
    Question: Does the promotion of Mandarin Chinese mean eliminating dialects?
    Answer: The promotion of Mandarin Chinese is to eliminate the barriers between dialects, not to prohibit or eliminate dialects. Dialects will exist for a long time. They cannot be prohibited by administrative orders, nor can they be eliminated by artificial methods. Dialects are also a useful tool for communication, serving the people of a specific region. However, they have regional limitations, and beyond this limit, they lose their function as a communication tool and become an obstacle to mutual understanding. The purpose of promoting Mandarin Chinese is to enable people who speak dialects to learn a common language of the whole nation in addition to their native dialect, so as to communicate with people from various regions. On the other hand, since dialects still play an important role in local activities, outside cadres should also actively learn the local dialects in order to closely connect with the masses and do a good job.

    答读者问
    问：既然拼音字母主要是用来帮助扫盲，帮助巩固扩大扫盲成果，帮助推广普通话，那么，非文盲和会说普通话的人是不是就没有必要学习汉语拼音字母了呢？
    答：非文盲固然不必依靠拼音字母来认识常用汉字。可是，汉字数目多达三、四万，报刊通用的也有五、六千，不要说认识千多两千常用字的刚“脱盲”的非文盲，就是文化水平较高的知识分子，也往往提笔忘字，遇字忘音，或者读错字音。如果学会了汉语拼音字母，这些困难就可以用拼音字母注音的字典顺利地得到解决。会说普通话的人，要使自己的普通话说得更加纯正、更加容易为人了解，最方便的方法，也还是依靠用汉语拼音字母注音的读物和字典，随时检查，随时自己校正。
    此外，汉语拼音字母在科学技术上以至日常生活中的应用范围，正在一天比一天广泛。学会了拼音字母，就增加了不少便利。
    更重要的是：在目前文化革命和技术革命的运动中，每一个知识分子都应该为扫除文盲和推广普通话尽一份力量。而要最有效地担负起这个责任，就必须熟练地掌握汉语拼音字母。
    因此，无论从哪方面说，非文盲和会说普通话的人学习汉语拼音字母不能说是不必要的。
    问：推广普通话是不是要消灭方言？
    答：推广普通话是为的消除方言之间的隔阂，而不是禁止或者消灭方言。方言是会长期存在的。它不能用行政命令来禁止，也不能用人为的办法来消灭。方言也是一种有用的交际工具，它是为某一特定地区的人民服务的，但是它有地区的局限性，超过这个限度就丧失交际工具的作用，成为相互了解的障碍。推广普通话的目的就是要使说方言的人们在自己的乡音以外，学会说一种全民族共同的语言，以便跟各地区的人互相交际。另一方面，由于方言在地方性活动中仍然起着重要的作用，外来干部还应当积极学习当地的方言，以便密切联系群众，做好工作。（附图片）
