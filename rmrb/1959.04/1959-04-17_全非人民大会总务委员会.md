　　All-African People's Conference General Steering Committee
    The first emergency meeting of the All-African People's Conference General Steering Committee opened on the 15th in Conakry, the capital of the Republic of Guinea. This meeting will mainly discuss the recent events in the anti-colonialist struggle upsurge in Central Africa and the Belgian Congo, as well as effective ways to mobilize world opinion to support the African national independence struggle.
    The General Steering Committee is a permanent organization of the All-African People's Conference. The task of this organization is similar to that of a general council, and it also appoints a three-member working committee to be stationed in the Secretariat of the Conference (located in Accra) to work with the Secretary-General.
    The General Steering Committee is composed of a chairman and fourteen members elected by the heads of the various delegations participating in the All-African People's Conference. The current General Steering Committee was elected at the First All-African People's Conference last December. Mboya, Chairman of the Kenya People's Congress Party, was elected as Chairman, and the members include representatives from Ghana, the United Arab Republic, Nigeria, Kenya, Central Africa, South Africa, Ethiopia, Algeria, Tunisia, West Africa, Guinea, Togo, Cameroon, and the Belgian Congo. According to regulations, the term of office for committee members is one year, and the committee meets every six months. In special circumstances, the committee can convene emergency meetings. Under normal circumstances, the committee should hold a meeting around June of this year.
    The early convening of this meeting marks a new upsurge in the movement against colonial rule and for national independence throughout the African continent under the international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　全非人民大会总务委员会
    全非人民大会总务委员会所召开的第一次紧急会议已在15日在几内亚共和国首都科纳克里开幕。这次会议主要将讨论最近在中非和比属刚果反殖民主义斗争高潮中所发生的事件，以及动员世界舆论支持非洲民族独立斗争的有效办法。
    总务委员会是全非人民大会的常设组织。这个组织的任务与一般理事会的任务类似，它还任命了一个三人工作委员会驻在大会的秘书处（设在阿克拉），同秘书长一起进行工作。
    总务委员会由参加全非人民大会的各个代表团团长选出主席一人和委员十四人组成。这一届总务委员会是在去年12月第一次全非人民大会上选出的。怯尼亚人民大会党主席姆博亚当选为主席，委员有加纳、阿联、尼日利亚、怯尼亚、中非、南非、埃塞俄比亚、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、西非、几内亚、多哥、喀麦隆和比属刚果的代表。根据规定，委员会委员任期一年，委员会每半年召开一次，如有特殊情况，委员会可以召开紧急会议。按照正常情况，委员会应该是在今年6月间举行会议。
    这次会议提前召开，标志着在东风压倒西风的国际形势下，非洲整个大陆反对殖民统治、争取民族独立运动的新的高涨。（新华社）
