Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou’s government work report and the reports of other government leaders. I wholeheartedly support the Central People's Government's policy and measures to thoroughly quell the rebellion in Tibet. I express boundless indignation at the attempts by imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and Indian expansionist elements to use the rebellion of a small number of upper-class Tibetan reactionaries to undermine our country's unity and national solidarity. We must resolutely fight back.

I am a rightist, and I have committed great crimes against the country and the people. After more than a year of help from the Party and the masses, and self-reflection, I have gained some understanding. Now I would like to report my understanding to everyone.

In the summer of 1957, when everyone sharply criticized me, I initially did not admit that I was a rightist. Later, in the face of overwhelming evidence, I had to admit it, but I felt that I had no intention of opposing the Party or socialism in my subjective thinking; I was only objectively a rightist. This idea was obviously untenable under criticism. My actions were dictated by my thoughts. If I did not have anti-Party and anti-people ideas in my mind, how could I have anti-Party and anti-people actions? So then I admitted that I was subjectively a rightist as well. But at this time, I came up with another idea to comfort myself: that my becoming a rightist was just an accidental slip. But after calm reflection, this was clearly also wrong. Although I had read some works on Marxism-Leninism in the past, knowledge is knowledge, and I am still me. Marxism-Leninism has not become my flesh and blood, but is just an overcoat. The bourgeois stance is still stubbornly entrenched in my mind like a stone. After the basic completion of the Three Great Transformations, the economic base has changed, and ideology will naturally inevitably change accordingly; this is an objective law. In the past, although I knew this principle, my reactionary class stance led me to draw a conclusion contrary to this principle. During the period of socialist revolution, the bourgeois stance and Marxism-Leninism belong to the category of hostile ideas. Since I was unwilling to use my limited knowledge of Marxism-Leninism to connect with ideological reality and criticize my own bourgeois stance and views, then of course I could only use bourgeois views to distort Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, when the socialist revolution further deepened on the political and ideological fronts, the beautiful overcoat was removed, and my true colors were revealed. So my becoming a rightist was by no means accidental, but on the contrary had deep class roots.

Regarding the criticism and struggle by the masses, I initially held a great deal of resistance. I thought, since you are struggling against me, why do you still say you are helping me? But when I began to have the desire to transform the old me and establish a new me, when my stance began to change, my view was completely different. Since I want to break the old me and establish a new me, but sometimes I can't help but hesitate, and I still have a little nostalgia and regret for the old me, or I feel that taking out all my internal organs and showing them to people is inevitably smelly and disgusting, or I can't bear to attack the old me, or I attack but don't hit the key point. At this time, the masses come out to point out my dirty thoughts, point out the direction of my progress, and use the power of the masses to push me forward; isn't this help? I also thought that everyone is very busy right now, so why do they still take the time out of their busy schedule to criticize me and help me? Isn't this hoping that I will change my position and join everyone in moving forward together? Thinking of this, I felt the preciousness and kindness of the criticism from the masses, and the sincere friendship of those who criticized me. So now I only have gratitude for the criticism from the masses and no resentment at all.

Regarding physical labor, I would also like to talk about a little bit of my experience. Over the past year or so, I have also had different ideas about physical labor. At first, I had a task-oriented view: whatever work is given to me, I will try my best to complete it, and that's it. In the beginning, I felt some fatigue, so I had a test-oriented view, thinking that this was a test for me, and I had to withstand the test. Later, I had a atonement-oriented view, thinking that labor was to atone for my sins against the people. But I thought to myself, how can such a small amount of labor atone for such a huge sin? I couldn't help but feel confused about this. Recently, I felt that these are not the most important things. The main purpose of the organization in asking me to participate in physical labor is to cultivate my labor perspective and labor habits, so that I have the thoughts and feelings of the working people, and thus gradually establish the position and views of the working people. After understanding this point, I gradually felt the hardship and happiness in labor, and gradually learned to analyze my own thoughts and activities in the labor process, and appreciate the greatness and wisdom of the workers. I began to know that planting a radish or a tomato is not an easy task, requiring accumulating manure, composting manure, applying fertilizer, topdressing, seedling cultivation, transplanting, and planting, hoeing soil, opening furrows, leveling the ground, raking the ground, and weeding. In the past, when I saw radishes, I only knew how to eat them, but now I know how much effort and sweat of the working people they contain.

Ideological transformation itself is a painful process. But when I realized that this is an objective law that does not depend on human will, my mood became more cheerful. Everyone is the same, only by recognizing and mastering this objective law can we truly gain freedom. Violating this law and pursuing the so-called individual freedom in fantasy will only make us feel more and more unfree and fall into a state of confusion. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Qing Dynasty collapsed, but there were still a small number of royalists who, violating the laws of historical development, dragged a small braid and tried to be loyal to a dynasty that would never return. I was very young at the time, but I already thought that these antiques were really very funny and ridiculous. Now history is going through a new era, and socialism in our country has achieved a decisive victory, and the capitalist system is gone forever. I have no intention of being loyal to the capitalist system, and I certainly do not want to be an antique-style remnant of the old dynasty that I thought was funny and ridiculous when I was a child.

I want to thank the Party for its multifaceted education and assistance to me over the past year or so, taking care of me in life, creating many conditions conducive to transformation for me, giving me a future, and giving me a political position. Now I have made up my mind to transform myself, and the new me and the old me are incompatible. But relying solely on my personal efforts is not enough; sometimes I cannot avoid being attacked by negative emotions. Therefore, I earnestly hope that the Party and everyone will give me supervision, criticism, and oversight. When our country's socialist construction is leaping forward in a galloping momentum, I must resolve to accelerate my self-transformation and strive to return to the ranks of the people as soon as possible, and contribute a small amount of effort to the socialist construction of the motherland.

### 我的体会和决心  黄药眠委员的发言

专栏：

    我的体会和决心
    黄药眠委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，及其他政府首长的报告，衷心拥护我中央人民政府彻底平息西藏叛乱的方针和措施，对帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮、印度的扩张主义分子企图利用一小撮西藏上层反动分子的叛乱来破坏我国的统一和民族的团结表示无比的愤怒，我们必须给予坚决的回击。
    我是一个右派分子，对国家对人民都犯了很大的罪行。经过一年多来党和群众的帮助和自我的反省，我也有些体会。现在我想就我的体会拿来向大家汇报一下。
    在一九五七年夏天，大家尖锐地批评我的时候，我最先不承认我自己是右派，后来在大量的事实面前，只好承认了，但又觉得我在主观上并无反党反社会主义的意图，我不过是客观上成了右派而已。这个想法，显然也经不起批评。我的行动是受我的思想支配的，我的脑子里如果没有反党反人民的思想，如何又会有反党反人民的行动？于是才又承认，主观上也是右派。可是这时我又想出另外一个想法来安慰自己：就是我之成为右派不过是偶然失足。但经过冷静的思考以后，这显然也是不对的。尽管过去我也曾读了一些有关马列主义的著作，但是知识是知识，我还是我。马列主义并没有成为我的血肉和灵魂，而不过是外衣，资产阶级的立场，其实还是顽固得像石头一样盘据在我的脑子里。三大改造运动基本完成以后，经济基础已经改变了，思想意识自然也就必然会随之改变，这是客观的规律。过去我虽然知道这个道理，但是我的反动的阶级立场却使我作出了和这道理相反的结论。在社会主义革命时期，资产阶级的立场和马列主义是属于敌对的思想范畴，既然我不愿意运用我仅有的马列主义的知识去联系思想实际，批判我自己的资产阶级的立场和观点，那么当然我就唯有用资产阶级的观点去歪曲马列主义。所以当社会主义革命进一步深入于政治战线思想战线上的时候，美丽的外衣揭开，我的原形就毕露了。所以我之成为右派，绝不是偶然的，相反而是有深刻的阶级根源的。
    对于群众的批评和斗争，我最初也是抱着很大的抵触情绪的，我想既然斗争我，为什么又还说对我帮助呢？但是当我开始有了改造旧我建立新我的意愿的时候，我的立场开始有了转变的时候，我的这个看法就完全不同了。我既然要打破旧我建立新我，但是有时总未免犹疑，对于旧我总还有一点留恋和惋惜，或者是觉得五脏六腑都拿出来给人看见，未免腥臭难闻，或者是对于旧我不忍下手，或者是下手而击不中要害。在这时候，群众出来指出我的肮脏的思想，指出我前进的方向，以群众的力量来推动我，这难道不是帮助吗？我又想到，在目前大家都很忙，为什么他们还要在这百忙中抽出时间来批评我，帮助我呢？这难道不是希望我改变立场，重新和大家一起共同前进吗？想到这里，我就感到群众批评的可贵和亲切，感到批评我的人的真诚的友谊。所以现在我对于群众的批评只有感谢之意而毫无怨怼之心。
    对于体力劳动，我也想谈谈我的一点体会。一年多以来，对于体力劳动，我也有过不
  同的想法。最先我是任务观点，给我什么工，我就努力把它做完，做完就算了。在开始的时候，有些感到劳累，于是我又有考验的观点，认为这是对我的考验，我要经得起考验，后来我又有一种赎罪的观点，认为劳动乃是向人民赎罪。但是自己想，以米粒之劳，如何能赎如山之罪呢？对此又未免感到徬徨。最近我又觉得这些都不是最重要的。组织上之所以要我参加体力劳动，其主要目的是在于培养我的劳动观点和劳动习惯，使我具有劳动人民的思想感情，从而逐渐地树立起劳动者的立场和观点。了解到这一点以后，我才渐渐感到劳动中的艰苦和快乐，渐渐学会分析自己在劳动过程中的一点一滴的思想活动，体会到劳动者的伟大和智慧。开始知道种一棵萝卜，一株西红柿也不是一件容易的事情，要积肥、沤肥、施肥、追肥，要育苗、移苗、定植，要锄土、开畦、平地、耪地、薅草。过去我看见萝卜只知道吃它，现在我才知道它包含着多少劳动人民的力和汗。
    思想改造本身是一个痛苦的过程。但当我认识到这乃是不依人的意志为转移的客观规律时，我的心情就比较开朗了。任何人都一样，只有认识和掌握这个客观规律，才能真正获得自由，违背这个规律，去追求幻想中的所谓个人自由，那就唯有越来越觉得不自由而陷入于迷惘的境地。辛亥革命以后，大清皇朝崩溃了，但还有一小撮保皇党人，违背历史发展的规律，拖着一条小辫子，要去为一去不复返的王朝效忠。我当时年纪很小，但已经觉得他们这些古董实在十分滑稽可笑。现在历史又正在经历着一个新的时代，社会主义在我们中国已经获得了决定性的胜利，资本主义制度已一去不可复返了，我无意于为资本主义制度效忠，更决不愿意做一个我小时候认为滑稽可笑的古董式的遗老。
    我要感谢党在这一年多以来对我的多方面的教育和帮助，在生活上照顾我，并为我创造了许多有利于改造的条件，给予我以前途，给予我以政治地位。现在我已下定决心改造自己，新我与旧我誓不两立。但光是靠我个人的努力还是不够的，有时我还不免为消极的情绪所袭击，因此我恳切地希望党和大家给我以督促批评和监督。当我国的社会主义建设正以万马奔腾的形势向前飞跃的时候，我必须决心加速自我改造，争取早日回到人民的队伍中来，为祖国的社会主义建设尽一点最微小的力量。
