Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd dispatch from New Delhi: Certain leaders and figures from the Indian ruling party, the Congress Party, and the Indian government have made various remarks regarding the Tibetan rebellion.

The Congress Party Chairman, Prime Minister Nehru's daughter, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, said after the Tibetan rebellion, "I agree that India and Tibet have common, long-standing cultural and religious ties." This chairman of the Congress Party actually denied China's sovereignty over Tibet, calling China's Tibet region a "nation." She said she was concerned that, under the current circumstances, India would not be able to provide much assistance to this "nation" of Tibet. She also said that, according to international law, India would grant "asylum" to any "refugees" from Tibet.

Mrs. Kriplani, the General Secretary of the Congress Party, has repeatedly slandered China by taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion. On April 5th, at a public rally in Indore, she said, "The Congress Party will not hesitate to announce to the world China's atrocities in Tibet." She said that although under China's "suzerainty," Tibet was still an "autonomous country." She said India expressed "complete sympathy" for the "just cause" of the Tibetan people. This Congress Party leader also serves as the chairman of a committee providing "relief and hospitality" to so-called "Tibetan refugees" (a small group of Tibetan rebels who fled to India). Subsequently, on April 15th, she announced the establishment of a so-called "National Committee" to "help Tibetan refugees."

It is reported that Mrs. Pandit, the Indian High Commissioner in London and Prime Minister Nehru's sister, told reporters in London in early April that the West seemed impatient. She assured them that India would do everything possible "within reasonable limits" to "help" Tibet, "as for how to help, that is a matter to be decided by the Indian government when the situation is clearer." She said, "At present, I do not know what my government will do. However, as for which side India sympathizes with, there can be no doubt. We have the deepest sympathy for the Dalai Lama and his government."

In response to a question about whether India would tolerate the so-called "rule of Tibet by Red China," she said: "I am not interested in China ruling Tibet. Our view is that no country should be ruled by another foreign country. What I care about is whether Tibet, India, and other countries have the ability to rise up and resist countries that want to rule."

During a speech on April 1st in the Indian People's House concerning the temporary motion regarding the rebellion in Tibet, Home Minister Pant said, "Here, we are in a troubling position. We hope to maintain this friendship with China, which is our neighbor, a great country, with whom we have an agreement, and with whom our ties go back hundreds of years. But at the same time, Tibet is a closer neighbor, a very weak neighbor, and it should receive pity and sympathy, if nothing else." However, this Home Minister was ambiguous and did not directly state who exactly he was giving "sympathy" to in Tibet.

Congress Party Executive Committee member and former Chairman Debar published an article in the party's publication "Economic Review" in early April, describing the failure of the rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet in collusion with imperialism and foreign reactionaries as a "tragedy of Tibet," saying that "a world power has once again failed to treat its weaker neighbor fairly and justly." He even demanded that China "reconsider its measures in Tibet." He also maliciously said, "When the interests of the stronger party to the agreement are involved, the terms of the agreement are worthless, and the philosophy of socialism is no guarantee against expansionist tendencies." Debar did not explain whether China's safeguarding of its territorial sovereignty is "expansionism," then what is interference in China's internal affairs?

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 23rd: While some political parties and figures in India are using the Tibetan incident to brazenly attack China, they are even more recklessly engaging in activities that interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine Sino-Indian friendship. According to a press release issued by the so-called "Central Relief Committee for Tibetans," announced by Mrs. Kriplani, the General Secretary of the Indian Congress Party, the committee held a meeting on April 19th. At the meeting, Acharya Kriplani, a leader of the People's Socialist Party, was elected as chairman, and the meeting authorized him to express "respect" and "welcome" to the Dalai Lama in the name of the "committee."

This "committee" also includes former People's Socialist Party leader Jayaprakash Narayan, Congress Party Member of Parliament P. Subbarayan, and "Hindustan Times" editor Durgadas.

The "committee" issued an appeal for donations to "help Tibetans seeking political asylum in India." The appeal said in a provocative manner: "In our country, people are filled with sympathy for the Tibetan people who are suffering from the tragic situation in their country today."

The appeal described the relationship between India and Tibet as a relationship between "two countries," stating that "for centuries, there have been close religious and cultural ties between the people of our two countries. In addition, there are close trade relations, and pilgrims have been traveling between the two countries for hundreds of years."

The appeal said, "The relationship between India and Tibet is more intimate than the normal political relationship that exists between any two neighboring countries. Therefore, the sympathy for the Tibetan people that has emerged in India is something deeper than political sympathy."

However, this inflammatory appeal did not further explain what this "sympathy" actually is.

It is reported that the Delhi municipal authorities passed a resolution on the 22nd stating that Delhi should hold a mass welcoming rally for the Dalai Lama. The resolution described Tibet as India's "neighboring country." It said, "The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader and great freedom fighter of India's great neighboring country, Tibet." The resolution also expressed welcome for his safe arrival in India and welcomed the government's decision to grant him asylum.

"The Indian Express" reported today that "although the Dalai Lama has decided to live in Mussoorie, and there is no indication that he will visit Delhi in the near future, the municipal authorities spent more than two hours today discussing whether or not to hold a welcoming rally for him."

Narayan, a leader of the Indian Socialist Party who is particularly interested in using the Tibetan incident to viciously attack China, frantically clamored again on the 22nd that the Indian people should announce in unison that Tibet is an "independent country." In his speech, Narayan exposed the political ambitions of Indian expansionists. He said that among Asian countries, only India can help Tibet achieve peaceful reforms in a so-called "manner that is in the interests of the Tibetan people." Narayan also expressed the hope of submitting the "Tibetan issue" to the United Nations, attempting to use the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs.

    印度执政党和官方一些领袖人物
    骂朋友　伤友邦　颠倒黑白
    国大党主席公然把我国的西藏说成是“国家”
    国大党总书记把西藏叛乱说成是“正义事业”
    新华社23日讯　新德里消息：印度执政党国大党和印度官方的某些领袖和人士，曾经就西藏叛乱事件发表了各色各样的言论。
    国大党主席、尼赫鲁总理的女儿英迪拉·甘地夫人在西藏叛乱事件发生以后发表谈话说，“我同意印度和西藏有着共同的、历史悠久的文化和宗教联系的。”这位国大党的主席竟然否认中国对西藏的主权，把中国西藏地方说成是“国家”。她说，她担心在目前情况下，印度不能够给西藏这个“国家”很大的帮助。她又说，根据国际法，印度将准许从西藏来的任何“难民”“避难”。
    国大党总书记克里帕拉尼夫人一再借西藏叛乱事件诽谤中国。4月5日她在印多尔的公众集会上说，“国大党将毫不犹豫地向世界宣布中国在西藏的暴行”。她说，虽然在中国的“宗主权”下，西藏还是一个“自治国家”。她说印度对西藏人的“正义事业”表示“完全的同情”。这位国大党的领袖还担任了向所谓“西藏难民”（逃入印度的一小撮西藏叛乱分子）提供“救济和招待”的一个委员会的主席。随后她在4月15日又宣布成立一个所谓“帮助西藏难民”的“全国委员会”。
    据报道，印度驻伦敦高级专员、尼赫鲁总理的妹妹潘迪特夫人4月初在伦敦对新闻记者说，西方似乎感到迫不及待。她保证说，印度将在“合理范围内”尽一切可能“帮助”西藏，“至于如何帮助，那是应当由印度政府在形势比较清楚时决定的问题。”她说，“目前，我不知道我的政府会做些什么。但是，至于印度同情哪一方，这是不能有任何怀疑余地的。我们对达赖喇嘛和他的政府怀有最深切的同情。”
    她在答复关于印度将容忍所谓“红色中国对西藏的统治”的问题说：“我对中国统治西藏不感兴趣。我们的意见是，任何国家都不得受另一个外国统治。我关心的是西藏、印度和其它国家是否有能力起来抵抗想进行统治的国家。”
    内政部长潘特在4月1日曾经在印度人民院就关于西藏事件叛乱的临时动议发表谈话时说，“这里，我们处在一个伤脑筋的地位，我们希望维持同中国的这种友谊，中国是我们的邻人，是个伟大的国家，我们同它订有协议，我们同它的联系追述到好几百年以前。但是同时，西藏是个更接近的邻人，是个非常弱小的邻人，它应该得到怜悯和同情，假如得不到别的的话。”但是，这位内政部长含糊其辞，他没有直接明说，他口口声声说给予“同情”的究竟是西藏的什么人？
    国大党执行委员会委员、上届主席德巴4月初在这个党的机关刊物“经济评论”上发表文章，把西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义和外国反动派而发动的叛乱的失败，说成是“西藏的悲剧”，说什么“一个世界大国再一次没有能够公正、公平地对待它的较弱小的邻居”。他竟然要求中国“重新考虑它在西藏的措施”。他还恶毒地说，“当问题牵涉到协约双方较强的一方的利益时，协议的条款就没有什么价值了，社会主义的哲学并不是防止扩张主义倾向的保证。”德巴没有解释，中国保障自己的领土主权的完整是“扩张主义”，那么，干涉中国内政又是什么主义呢？
    新华社新德里23日电　印度的一些政党和政界人士在利用西藏事件放肆地攻击中国的同时，更变本加厉地进行干涉中国内政、破坏中印友谊的活动。据由印度国大党总书记克里帕拉尼夫人宣布成立的所谓“中央救济西藏人委员会”所发表的新闻公报，这个委员会在4月19日举行了会议。在会上，人民社会党领导人阿恰里亚·克里帕拉尼当选为主席，会议并且授权他以“委员会”的名义向达赖喇嘛表示“敬意”和“欢迎”。
    这个“委员会”还包括前人民社会党领导人贾雅普拉卡希·纳拉扬，国大党议员普·苏巴拉延以及“印度斯坦时报”主编杜加达斯。
    “委员会”发表了为“帮助在印度寻找政治避难的西藏人”募捐的呼吁书。呼吁书煽动人心地说：“在我国，人们对今天遭到他们国内悲惨局势的西藏人民充满了同情。”
    呼吁书把印度同西藏的关系说成是“两国之间”的关系，它说，“几世纪来，我们两国人民之间存在着密切的宗教和文化联系。此外还有密切的贸易关系，几百年来香客们一直往来于两国之间。”
    呼吁书说，“印度和西藏之间的关系比任何两个邻邦之间存在的正常的政治关系更为亲密。因此，在印度涌现出来的对西藏人民的同情是一种比政治上的同情更为深切的东西。”
    但是，这个煽动性的呼吁书并没有进一步说明这种“同情”究竟是什么东西。
    据报道，德里市政机构在22日通过一项决议说，德里应该为达赖喇嘛举行群众欢迎大会。这份决议把西藏说成是印度的“邻国”。它说，“达赖喇嘛是印度伟大的邻国——西藏——的精神领袖和伟大的自由战士。”决议还表示欢迎他平安抵达印度，并且欢迎政府给他避难权的决定。
    “印度快报”今天报道说，“虽然达赖喇嘛已经决定住在穆索里，并没有迹象说明在最近的将来要对德里进行访问，而市政机构今天用了两个多小时来讨论是否应当为他举行欢迎大会。”
    对利用西藏事件恶毒攻击中国特别感到兴趣的印度社会党领袖纳拉扬22日又疯狂叫嚷，印度人应该同声宣布，西藏是一个“独立国家”。纳拉扬在讲话中暴露了印度扩张主义者的政治野心。他说，在亚洲国家中，只有印度能够以所谓“符合西藏人利益的方法”来帮助西藏实现和平改革。纳拉扬还表示希望把“西藏问题”提交联合国，企图利用联合国来干预中国内政。
