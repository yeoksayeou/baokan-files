　　Make the "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall" More Beautiful
　　People of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Launch a Greenification Upsurge

　　(Our dispatch) The Hui and Han people of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are determined to make the "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall" even more beautiful, and have launched a massive greenification upsurge.

　　On the boundless Yellow River Plain and the undulating southern mountainous areas, one can see the Hui and Han people fighting to gradually realize the landscaping of the land: at dawn, people climb onto tall mother trees along highways or canal banks, busily cutting branches for planting. Commune and state-owned forest farm nursery workers drive vehicles loaded with saplings to the forest land. Large tracts of wasteland at the foot of Helan Mountain and Liupan Mountain have been covered with dense crowds in recent days. Hui women, who rarely went out in the past, have also joined the greenification battle this year, and some even venture into the barren mountains and sandy wastelands with male commune members.

　　This year, the entire region plans to afforest 2.5 million mu, plant 26 million trees, and also plans to cultivate 15,000 mu of fast-growing and high-yield forests. More than 60% of these tasks are to be completed in the spring. Since 1958, a large-scale windbreak and sand-fixation and bank-protection forest belt, 1,270 li long, has been built here, starting from Zhongwei County on the edge of the Tengger Desert, going north along the desert area to Shizuishan, and then extending south to Taole, Yanchi and other counties. This year's afforestation task is mainly to build this forest belt.

　　Since February, people's communes and forestry units in various places have organized manpower to conduct forest land surveys and delineate afforestation areas, prepare tree seeds and seedlings, and train a group of forestry technicians. They adopted the method of dividing and contracting responsibilities by area, imparting afforestation techniques. Many communes and production teams have also established commune-run forest farms and afforestation professional teams. At the beginning of afforestation, people's communes in various places adopted a combination of afforestation professional teams and shock brigades; giving priority to sandy wasteland, then to bank protection, and then to planting around houses. Zhongwei County, on the edge of the Tengger Desert, mainly relying on commune members, plus staff, cadres, and students, formed a 100,000-strong army and plunged into the afforestation battle. They put forward the slogan: "Treat windy days as good days, treat night as day, and treat the moon as a lamp," to ensure the early completion of the spring afforestation task. The broad masses of Hui and Han people in Pingluo County, which achieved great results in afforestation last year, started very early this year. On March 22 alone, 4,000 members of the Yellow River People's Commune in this county built more than 3,000 mu of bank-protection forest along the Yellow River. The afforestation upsurge to green the barren mountains in the southern mountainous area of the autonomous region also followed closely on the heels of the Yinchuan Plain. The Hui and Han commune members here proposed: "To turn barren mountains and bald ridges into forest gardens, and to turn arid mountainous areas into scenic mountains with flowers and fruits."

　　In recent years, the Hui and Han people of the entire region, in building their homes, have fought against wind and sand, declared war on barren mountains, and built a large number of shelterbelts and beautifying trees around houses. Last year alone, they afforested more than 2.73 million mu, which is more than three times the total afforestation area in the eight years since liberation. After three years of hard work, the "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall" will become even more beautiful. (Huang Jing)

### 让“塞上江南”更加美丽  宁夏回族自治区人民掀起绿化高潮

　　让“塞上江南”更加美丽
　　宁夏回族自治区人民掀起绿化高潮
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区的回汉族人民，决心要把“塞上江南”打扮得更加美丽，掀起了声势浩大的绿化高潮。
    在一望无际的黄河平原和山峦起伏的南部山区，可以看到回汉族人民为逐步实现大地园林化而奋战的情景：早晨天刚黎明，人们就攀登在公路或渠岸高大的母树上，忙着砍伐树栽。公社和国营林场的苗圃工人们，赶着满载苗木的车辆，运往林地。贺兰山和六盘山下大片的荒地上，连日来出现密密层层的人群。往年很少出门的回族妇女，今年也参加了绿化战斗，有的还和男社员一起远征荒山、沙原。
    今年，全区计划造林二百五十万亩，植树二千六百万株，还计划培育一万五千亩的快速丰产林。其中60％以上的任务要在春季完成。从1958年开始，这里就大规模地营造一条长达一千二百七十华里的防风固沙和护岸林带，这条林带从腾格里大沙漠边沿的中卫县起，沿沙漠地带北上到石咀山，再向南绵延到陶乐、盐池等县。今年的造林任务主要就是营造这条林带。
    从2月以来，各地人民公社和林业单位，就组织人力进行了林地勘察和划定造林地区，准备树种树苗，并训练了一批林业技术人员。他们采取分片包干的办法，传授了造林技术，许多公社和生产队还建立了社办林场和造林专业队。造林开始，各地人民公社都采取造林专业队和突击队相结合；先沙荒、后护岸、再四旁的办法突击造林。腾格里沙漠边沿的中卫县，以公社社员为主，加上职工、干部、学生等组成了十万大军，投入造林战斗。他们提出：“拿风天当好天，拿黑夜当白天，拿月亮当灯悬”的口号，保证提前完成春季造林任务。去年造林中成绩很大的平罗县的广大回汉人民，今年动手得特别早。这个县的黄河人民公社的四千名社员，在3月22日一天，就沿着黄河营造护岸林三千多亩。自治区南部山区绿化荒山的造林高潮，也随银川平原接踵而起。这里的回汉族社员提出：“要把荒山秃岭变林园，把干旱山区变成山清水秀的花果山。”
    几年来，全区回汉族人民，在建设自己的家园中，与风沙搏斗，向荒山宣战，营造了大批的防护林带和美化环境的四旁林木，去年一年就造林二百七十三万多亩，等于解放八年来造林面积总和的三倍以上。苦战三年以后，“塞上江南”将会变得更加美丽。（黄静）
