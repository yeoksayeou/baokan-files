Seeking Advice from the Masses
Guangxi Michang Steel Plant Achieves All-Around Success

Nanning, April 21 (By Our Own Correspondent) – Leading cadres of the Guangxi Michang Steel Plant sought advice from the masses and gathered the "resourceful advisors" among the workers to jointly study and improve production. This reversed the deficit situation and achieved an all-around success in various indicators.

In March, the plant not only comprehensively overfulfilled the production value, output, profit delivery, and labor plans, but also, due to improved labor productivity, the number of steelmaking workers was reduced by half; technology was improved, and the coke ratio decreased from 1.6 to 1.2; the blast furnace utilization coefficient reached an advanced record of 1.77; and the cost per ton of pig iron decreased from 418 yuan to 224 yuan, reversing the deficit situation of January and February.

Since the end of last year, the production of the Michang Steel Plant had been hampered because it had not mastered the technology of indigenous coke ironmaking. Some factories pointed out that their plant's production was backward. The plant's CCP branch held a special branch meeting to discuss how to improve production and catch up with advanced levels. The meeting unanimously agreed that only by fully mobilizing the masses and encouraging everyone to come up with ideas could they overcome the hurdle of indigenous coke ironmaking and change their backward status. Therefore, the branch decided to hand over all tasks and difficulties to the masses for discussion and launch a great airing of views and a movement for everyone to contribute ideas. After the meeting, the factory leadership immediately convened a workers' congress, explained the production plan, and raised the main difficulties in current production: the technology of indigenous coke ironmaking had not been mastered, and bottom-crusting accidents occurred frequently; there was no set of technical operating procedures, and the production responsibility system was not sound. More importantly, after bottom-crusting accidents occurred, a simple method of demolishing the furnace was adopted. A total of six furnaces were demolished in January and February, wasting materials and affecting production. At the same time, they announced some plans to improve production and called on everyone to contribute ideas and the entire factory to work together to improve production. Subsequently, a mass movement of great airing of views was immediately launched, with more than 3,100 big-character posters posted, including 1,357 rationalization proposals on improving blast furnace hearth design based on the characteristics of indigenous coke, establishing a responsibility system, and reversing the backward situation. These rationalization proposals opened the minds of the leading cadres and found a way to break through the technological barrier of indigenous coke ironmaking. As a result, the confidence of the cadres was strengthened, and the enthusiasm of the masses was even greater.

While mobilizing the masses, the factory decided that all cadres should go down to participate in production, focus on weak links, and focus on key issues in production, and work with workers to specifically study and improve production methods through practice. Chen Gang, the branch secretary, took the lead in going to the No. 1 blast furnace in the ironmaking workshop to serve as the furnace chief. In addition to the accountants and cashiers who participated in production for four hours a day due to business relations, all other cadres worked with the workers for eight hours a day, and administrative work was done in their spare time. They personally operated in front of the furnace, focusing on the problems of bottom crusting and tuyere nodule formation in the indigenous coke ironmaking furnace hearth, and sought advice from workers to study and improve the methods. As a result, these technical problems were solved one by one.

Through the mass airing of views, the leading cadres of the steel plant discovered a group of "resourceful advisors." Therefore, at the beginning of March, these "resourceful advisors" from veteran workers, new workers, technicians, and transferred cadres were absorbed into the technical committee as advisors to the leadership, specializing in studying foreign experience and new experiences and lessons in the plant's production, sorting them out, improving them, helping the leadership make decisions, and organizing promotion. In this way, the factory leadership was able to make timely judgments after listening to opinions from all parties, avoiding the shortcomings of indecision and hesitation in the past.

Based on the suggestions of the masses, the research of the technical committee, and the practical experience of the leading cadres, the factory promptly made several decisions to break through the barrier of indigenous coke ironmaking, and the passive situation of abnormal production was quickly reversed, and a great leap forward situation of "all-around success" in various measures appeared.

Now, the leading cadres of the steel plant are taking advantage of the situation to launch a red flag competition movement throughout the plant between workshops, groups, and individuals to maintain "all-around success." On the contribution platform for maintaining "all-around success," there are densely packed various brilliant plans newly proposed by workers. (Gong Chenghua)

### 向群众求谋问计  广西米场钢铁厂各项指标满堂红

    向群众求谋问计
    广西米场钢铁厂各项指标满堂红
    本报南宁21日电　广西米场钢铁厂的领导干部向群众求谋问计，集中职工的“能人谋士”共同研究改进生产，扭转了亏损局面，取得了各项指标满堂红的新局面。
    这个工厂在3月份不仅全面超额完成产值、产量、利润上交及劳动计划，而且由于提高了劳动生产率，炼铁工人减少一半；提高了技术，焦比由过去的一点六降低为一点二；高炉利用系数先进纪录达到一点七七；每吨生铁的成本由四百一十八元降到二百二十四元，一反
  1、2月份亏损局面。
    去年年底以来，米场钢铁厂的生产，由于没有过好土焦炼铁的技术关，有的工厂指出他们厂生产落后，这个厂的中共支部为此专门召开了支部会议，讨论如何改进生产，赶上先进的问题。会上一致认为只有充分发动群众，大家想办法，才能突破土焦炼铁这道难关，改变落后面貌。于是支部就决定把任务和困难全部交给群众讨论，开展一个大鸣大放，人人献计运动。会后，工厂领导方面立即召开了职工大会，交代了生产计划，提出了当前生产中的主要困难：土焦炼铁技术关还没有过，经常发生结底事故；没有一套技术操作规程，生产责任制也不健全。更重要的是在发生结底事故后，就采取了简单的拆毁炉子的办法，1、2月份共计拆炉六次，浪费材料，影响生产。同时宣布改进生产的一些打算，号召人人献计，全厂同心协力，搞好生产。接着，一个群众性的大鸣大放运动立即开展起来，共贴出了三千一百多张大字报，其中有关根据土焦特点改进高炉炉缸设计、建立责任制、扭转落后局面的合理化建议有一千三百五十七条。这些合理化建议打开了领导干部的心窍，找到了突破土焦炼铁技术关的途径。于是干部信心增强，群众干劲更足了。
    在发动群众的同时，厂里决定全厂干部下放参加生产，抓薄弱环节，抓生产中的关键问题，通过实践和工人一起具体研究改进生产的办法。支部书记陈刚带头下放到炼铁车间一号高炉担任炉长。除了会计、出纳因为业务关系每天参加生产四小时外，其他所有干部每天都和工人一起劳动八小时，行政工作抽空办理。他们亲自到炉前操作，把土焦炼铁炉缸容易结底、风咀上下结瘤问题，当作重点，向工人求谋问计研究改进办法。结果，这些技术上的难题，相继一一解决了。
    这个钢铁厂的领导干部，通过群众性的大鸣大放，发现了一批“能人谋士”，于是在3月初就把这些来自老工人、新工人、技术人员、下放干部中的“能人谋士”吸收参加了技术委员会，作为领导的参谋，专门研究外地经验以及本厂生产中新的经验教训，加以整理提高，帮助领导抉择，组织推广。这样，工厂领导方面就能够在听取各方面的意见以后，及时作出判断，避免了过去只是几个人犹柔寡断和犹豫不决的缺点。
    根据群众建议，经过技术委员会的研究，和领导干部的实践经验，这个厂及时作出了几项突破土焦炼铁关的决定，生产不正常的被动局面迅速扭转过来，并且出现各项措施“满堂红”的大跃进局面。
    现在，这个钢铁厂的领导干部因势利导，又在全厂掀起了一个保持“满堂红”的车间与车间、小组与小组、个人与个人的红旗竞赛运动。保持“满堂红”献计台上，密密麻麻贴满了工人新提出的各种锦囊妙计。　（龚成华）
