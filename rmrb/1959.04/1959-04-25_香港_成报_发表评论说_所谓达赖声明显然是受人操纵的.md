Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, April 24th: The Hong Kong "Cheng Pao" published a commentary stating that the so-called Dalai Lama's statement "expresses his opinions under Nehru's encirclement, influence, and even restrictions, which is indeed an undeniable fact."

The Hong Kong "Sing Tao Evening News" wrote, "Since the Dalai's statement was initially published through Indian diplomatic personnel, it is clearly manipulated. This accusation may be factual, and we do not need to conceal India's intentions towards Tibet."

The Hong Kong "Hong Kong Observatory" reported, "The Tibetans themselves must not want to separate from China and become independent," and the so-called "Tibetan independence" is nothing more than the manipulation and creation of British and Indian expansionists. The newspaper also said that Tibet "is a place that the United States wants to contend for. Although the Americans have repeatedly stated that the Tibetan rebellion has nothing to do with them, they have in fact admitted to the airdrops, and airdrops cannot be initiated without the Americans."

    香港“成报”发表评论说
    所谓达赖声明显然是受人操纵的
    新华社香港24日电　香港“成报”发表评论说，所谓达赖喇嘛的声明“是在尼赫鲁的包围、影响、甚至是限制之下表达其意见，这实在是无可讳言的事实”。
    香港“星岛晚报”写道，“达赖的声明既曾通过印度外交人员而始发表，则已显然的是受操纵了。这个指责也可能是事实，我们可不必为印度对西藏的存心而隐瞒”。
    香港“天文台”报说，“西藏人自己必不愿脱离中国而独立的”，所谓“西藏独立”只不过是英国和印度扩张主义分子所操纵制造的。报纸还说，西藏“为美国所欲争之地，美国人虽多方声明，西藏叛变与彼无关，然事实上已承认有空投，而空投即非美国人主动莫办”。
