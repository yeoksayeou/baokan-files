Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th: U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower formally announced today that John Foster Dulles, whose illness has worsened, has resigned from his position as U.S. Secretary of State.

Dulles returned to Washington from his retreat in Florida on the 12th for further treatment due to the deterioration of his cancer. According to reports, less than 24 hours before Eisenhower announced the news, Dulles' doctors had concluded that the cancer cells in Dulles' body had spread to his neck. When Dulles first entered the hospital on February 13, the cancer cells were only limited to his abdomen.

The news stated that Eisenhower announced the news with tears in his eyes, telling reporters that Dulles was "definitely" no longer able to shoulder his responsibilities and formulate policies. He said that he would soon announce Dulles' successor. He said that the work of the Secretary of State would be handled by Under Secretary of State Herter in the interim. Herter has been acting as Secretary of State during Dulles' illness.

While announcing the news, Eisenhower stated that he had asked Dulles to continue serving as his personal foreign policy advisor.

    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔今天正式宣布病情恶化的杜勒斯辞去美国国务卿的职务。
    杜勒斯在12日由于癌症恶化从弗罗里达州的休养地赶回华盛顿作进一步的治疗。据报道，在艾森豪威尔宣布这一消息前不到二十四小时，杜勒斯的医生已经作出结论，杜勒斯身上的癌细胞已经扩展到颈部。在2月13日杜勒斯第一次进医院时，癌细胞还仅限于腹部。
    消息说，艾森豪威尔眼睛里含着泪水宣布了这一消息，他对记者说，杜勒斯已经“肯定地”不能再担负他的职务和制定政策了。他说他即将宣布杜勒斯的继承者。他说，国务卿的工作将由副国务卿赫脱代理。赫脱在杜勒斯生病期间一直在代行国务卿的职务。
    在宣布这一消息的同时，艾森豪威尔表示，他已经要求杜勒斯继续担任他本人的外交政策顾问。
