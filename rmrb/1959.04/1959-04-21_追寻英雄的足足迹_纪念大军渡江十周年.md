    In Pursuit of the Footprints of Heroes
    ——Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Great Army Crossing the Yangtze River
    Liu Baiyu

    In April 1949, a world-shaking voice emanated from the Yangtze River: "The People's Liberation Army, with a million strong, broke through the enemy lines and crossed the Yangtze River from a front of over a thousand li. From Jiujiang in the west to Jiangyin in the east, all are areas of the People's Liberation Army's river crossing. Starting from the night of the 20th, the Central Army of the People's Liberation Army on the north bank of the Yangtze River first broke through the Anqing and Wuhu lines, crossing to the areas of Fanchang, Tongling, Qingyang, Digang, and Lugang..."

    Time marches on, and ten years have unknowingly passed. Recently, I went to southern Anhui to visit various landing sites of the Great Army Crossing the River, to retrace the footsteps of the heroes.

    What drew me to make this visit was Comrade Mu Sirong. On April 6th, on the eve of the Great Army Crossing the River, he and Comrade Ya Bing led an advance detachment, breaking through the enemy's heavily guarded river defenses and penetrating southern Jiangsu. Later, he spoke to me several times about this legendary struggle. This time, what made my journey still full of realistic color was the personal guidance of Comrades Xu Shida and Wang Kexiang, who persisted in guerrilla warfare on the southern bank of the Yangtze River at the time and joined forces with the advance battalion. They pointed out to me all the places worth commemorating.

    It was March in southern Jiangsu, the gentle spring breeze carried the scent of rapeseed flowers, and the warm sunshine was somewhat intoxicating. We departed from Wuhu, traveled west along the Yangtze River, first visited Lugang, and then, with Digang as the center, visited the advance team's landing positions from Shili Factory to Jiajiangkou, and the locations where the advance team welcomed the main force, from Red Flower Mountain to Dakeshan.

    Old farmer Su Youshan led us to a stretch of beach in Shili Factory and said:

    "At that time, the wheat was already taller than a person. The next morning, I saw many footprints on this beach. The advance team had crossed the river and gone to the mountains and forests near Lion Mountain in the south."

    From the conversations of the people, I happily discovered and found the footprints of the heroes. Like a battlefield scout, having grasped the clues, I couldn't stop. We immediately advanced to Jiajiangkou. Now, the Yangtze River is as smooth as a mirror, and a white, seagull-like riverboat is floating down from upstream. Spring, like a great artist, uses carmine to paint patches of red flower grass, and gamboge to paint patches of rapeseed fields, while the chimneys of Tongguan Mountain are quietly emitting light smoke. But I know: what a turbulent storm of battle swept through here that night. In my bag, I kept a copy of the "Summary of the Advance River Crossing," which described the situation of breaking through the river defenses near Jiajiangkou: "... At ten o'clock, the crossing began with four arrows heading in different directions. Landing at 10:25, they seized the first embankment with sudden and courageous actions, and then searched and advanced towards Sanjiangkou, seeking ferries to cross the two inner rivers according to the basic plan, and went straight to Yangshan. Only the ships of the fifth class were hit and sunk by enemy artillery..." Yes, who can forget the heroic blood that surged through these calm waves! Today, asparagus is just sprouting from the soil, and the beach is covered with endless coking plants, but I hear a quiet sound of footsteps and a contact signal learning to croak like a frog, and at that time they were the messengers who brought this whole happy spring to southern Jiangsu!

    After leaving the banks of the Yangtze River, what we should do is follow the route of this force, and thus we have to abandon the jeep on the Yandunpu highway and trek deep into the mountains and forests. I don't want to describe the sights along the way in detail anymore. But I have to point out to the readers the towering peak – Yunling. The bright red azaleas bring it a beautiful wreath. The other side of Yunling is the former headquarters of the New Fourth Army. The people accompanying me told me that the songs of the War of Resistance once resounded throughout these mountains. After the Southern Anhui Incident, people entered an era of difficult guerrilla warfare here. In the spring of 1949, the advance team came from the distant north to this beautiful valley of Chentanchong to join comrades who persisted in the battle in southern Jiangsu. The shining spark finally ignited a magnificent flame. At that time, the people of all villages and households in Chentanchong flocked in like a temple fair, commenting on the comrades of the advance team and saying: "That's right, our troops are back!"

    "Look, they haven't changed after being away for so many years, they are still so good, so amiable." Listen! Is only a scene of history being unveiled here? No, this is a scene of the people's hearts, this is a scene full of victory, happiness and joy.

    Radio waves vibrated in the high sky, and the advance team in southern Jiangsu established close contact with the crossing command post in northern Jiangsu. On this day, a urgent telegram arrived: "The river crossing battle will be launched on the 20th." It was rainy and dark, the road was narrow and slippery, but the light had come like the dawn, and the people and troops in southern Jiangsu waiting for the river crossing signal marched towards the Yangtze River together, welcoming the great army to cross the river.

    The million-strong army on the north bank of the Yangtze River was ready to go, what exciting days those were! By telephone, verbally, at meeting tables, in front of the ranks, a inspiring message was being passed: Chairman Mao is not sleeping tonight, waiting for news of our river crossing operation. General Tan Zhenlin, the front-line commander, said meaningfully: "Tomorrow is the anniversary of the May 21st Incident. Twenty-two years ago, it was the day when the counter-revolution began its general offensive against the people. Twenty-two years later, it will be the day when the people finally end the rule of the counter-revolution." Yes, history is always created by the laborers. Now, all the combatants held their breath and watched the river. At first, the river surface was quiet, and the river bank was quiet. Suddenly, along the Yangtze River line, our artillery roared, and smoke and fire immediately filled the sky. The moment for the heroes to cross the river had arrived.

    I interviewed Sha Lao, who was working in the Wuwei County Party Committee at the time and personally dispatched ships to send troops across the river. The old man with a long beard smiled and told me:

    "The weather was very warm on the 20th. We stood on the beach in single clothes, without any wind. The smoke from the cigarettes just gathered around our mouths and didn't dissipate. Around seven o'clock, the troops all came to the river bank, and the boats were all out of the river ditches and sent to the river surface. The troops were divided into many echelons, one echelon with more than a hundred boats. You see the entire river surface was covered with boats. Once the time came, all the boats started together. The superiors ordered: no shouting, no smoking, for fear of revealing the target. But as soon as the boats started, a roar erupted on the river surface, earth-shattering, and no one could stop it. Everyone was rushing forward, and every boat was sliding forward quickly. As soon as the people in the back stepped on the boat, the boat in front had already sent out a red landing signal..." The great and magnificent era, even today, when we think of it, when we talk about it, it still flaps its wings and flies around us like an eagle!

    Now, let us turn back to the south bank of the Yangtze River and talk about the moment of the meeting!

    Wang Anbao (then using the pseudonym Yang Peng, was the head of a guerrilla team along the Yangtze River) with his piercing gaze said:

    "Ya Bing and Mu Sirong and I arrived at Red Flower Mountain. The mountain is very big and very high. As soon as we reached the top of the mountain, we saw a red glow on the Yangtze River, and we heard a booming sound of people on the Yangtze River. Piles of fire were burning everywhere in southern Jiangsu. Those were lit by guerrillas to guide the great army. At this time, the road was chaotic with people everywhere, the enemy troops were fleeing in a panic, and the masses ran out to welcome the great army. Ya Bing and Mu Sirong told me to stay, and they ran down the mountain."

    The advance team met with the river-crossing army at Longmen Mountain, Dakeshan and Jitou Mountain in front of Red Flower Mountain, passing through the flames and smoke of battle. It was before dawn on the 21st. Of course, this dawn was not just the dawn of this day, but the dawn of a new century. Clear brilliance has since shone over the mountains and fields south of the Yangtze River. The last dark dynasty pressing on the backs of the Chinese people collapsed in Nanjing, and completely disintegrated from there.

    This time, we drove along the road under Red Flower Mountain to the river, and climbed Dakeshan. Looking down from the mountain, both banks of the Yangtze River are in sight. On the opposite bank, the territory of Wuwei County is a verdant expanse of wheat fields, the Black Sand Island in the center of the river is like a green velvet blanket, and several rivers are like white belts. On this side of the river, where the landing army bravely stepped across, there is now a new road, passing right under the foot of Dakeshan. Dust is constantly flying, and rows of busy trucks are transporting iron ore from the southern Jiangsu area to the river bank, transferring it to Yangtze River shipping. Pieces of white sails are casting beautiful reflections on the green glass-like river. In this instant, I seemed to see the clear path from a heroic era of war to a heroic era of construction.

    After ending this visit to trace the footprints of heroes, the impression of Chentanchong was deeply left in my mind. The original remote mountain village in the guerrilla area has now become a prosperous and lively place, with flowing rivers, dense greenery, and a sound of sawing wood, crushing stones, and explosions. The footsteps of the Great Leap Forward shook the deep valleys of the jungle here, and people are mining minerals here. Particularly striking are a couplets of red paper pasted on both sides of a gate. People express their comfortable poetic spirit from the enthusiasm of labor:

    The factory and mine are full of spring,
    Red flags are dancing in the east wind.

    Yes, the east wind blows out infinite vitality, the verdant pine forest and the bright red azaleas are calling us, and we climb step by step to the towering Yunling.

    追寻英雄的足足迹
    ——纪念大军渡江十周年
    刘白羽
    1949年4月，从长江沿线，发出震撼世界的声音：“人民解放军百万大军，从一千余华里的战线上，冲破敌阵，横渡长江。西起九江，东至江阴，均是人民解放军的渡江区域。20日夜起，长江北岸人民解放军中路军首先突破安庆、芜湖线，渡至繁昌、铜陵、青阳、荻港、鲁港地区。……”
    时间在前进，不觉已经十年。最近，我到皖南，在大军渡江登陆各地，作了一次追寻英雄足迹的访问。
    吸引我作这次访问的，是慕思荣同志。他于大军渡江前夕，在4月6日，与亚冰同志率领一支先遣部队，冲破敌人密布的江防插入江南。而在以后，他曾几次和我说过这一段传奇式的斗争。这一次，使我的旅行仍然充满现实色彩的，得感谢当时在江南沿岸坚持游击斗争、并和先遣营会合的徐世达、王克祥同志的亲自引导，他们把那些可纪念的地方一一指点给我看。
    正是江南3月，柔和的春风吹着菜花香味，温暖的阳光有些醉人。我们从芜湖出发，沿江西行先看了鲁港，然后以荻港为中心，访问从十里厂到夹江口这一段先遣队登陆阵地，访问从红花山到大磕山这一带先遣队迎接大军会师的地点。
    老农民苏友山把我们带到十里厂的一片江滩上说：
    “那时麦子已经一人多高，第二天清早，我在这江滩上看到有很多脚印，先遣队渡过江已经到南面狮子山一带山林里去了。”
    从人们的谈话中，我欣喜地发现了、找到了英雄们的足迹了。像一个战地侦察兵一样，既已掌握到线索，就不能停止，我们立刻前进到了夹江口。现在，长江上波平如镜，一只白色海鸥似的江轮正从上游浮了下来，春天像一位大艺术家用胭脂涂出一片片红花草，用藤黄画出一片片油菜田，而铜官山的烟囱在静静的飘着轻烟。可是我知道：当年的夜晚，这儿刮过怎样急剧的战斗的风雨。我的行囊中保存有一份“先遣渡江总结”，其中讲述到突破夹江口附近江防的情况：“……十时开始以四个箭头分头齐渡，十时二十五分登陆，以突然勇猛之动作抢占头道堤埂、继向三江口搜索前进，按基本方案寻找渡船通过两道内河，直扑扬山，唯五班之船只为敌炮命中击沉，……”是的，谁能忘记这静静波涛中激流过这样一股英雄的鲜血呢！今天，芦笋刚刚从土壤里冒出嫩芽，江滩上遮盖着一望无际的炼焦场，我却听到一阵静悄悄的脚步声和学青蛙鸣叫的联络信号，而那时他们正是为江南带来这整个幸福春天的使者啊！
    离开长江边岸以后，我们应该做的就是追随着这支部队的路线前进，这样就不得不把吉普车舍弃在烟墩铺公路上，而徒步深入山林。我不想再详细叙述路上见闻。但我得指给读者们看那巍峨的高峰——云岭，鲜红的杜鹃花为它带上美丽的花环，云岭的那面就是当年的新四军军部，同行的人们告诉我那时抗战的歌声曾经响遍这一带山头。皖南事变之后，人们在这儿进入了艰难的游击战争年代。在1949年春天，先遣队从遥远的北方到这陈坦冲幽美的山谷里来和坚持江南战斗的同志们会合了，闪光的火种终于燃出了壮丽的火焰。当时陈坦冲各村各户老百姓都如同赶庙会一样涌来，品评着先遣队的同志们说：“不错，是我们的队伍回来了！”
    “你看，出去这么多年没变样，还是那么好，那么和气。”请听！难道在这里揭开的只是历史的一幕吗？不，这是人民的心灵的一幕，这是充满胜利的幸福与欢乐的一幕。
    电波在高空震荡，江南的先遣队和江北的渡口指挥部取得了密切联系。这一天来了一份火急的电报：“决于20日发起渡江战斗。”天雨夜黑、路窄脚滑，但是光明已如晨曦照临，等待渡江信号的江南人民与部队一齐向长江进发，迎接大军渡江。
    江北百万雄师整装待发，那是多么激动人心的时日呀！电话上、口头上，会议桌旁，行列的前面，传递着一个激励人心的消息：毛主席今天整夜不睡，在等待我们渡江作战的消息。前线指挥员谭震林将军这样意味深长地说：“明天，是马日事变纪念日，二十二年前，是反革命开始向人民总进攻的一天，二十二年后，将是人民最后结束反革命统治的一天。”是的，历史总是由劳动者手创的。现在，所有战斗者都屏息静气，注视着江面。开始江面上静静的，江岸上静静的，突然间，沿着长江一线，我们的炮火轰鸣起来，烟和火立刻布满天空，英雄们渡江的时刻到来了。
    我访问了当时在无为县县委工作，亲手调遣船只送部队渡江的沙老，这位飘着长髯的老人微笑着告诉我：
    “二十号那天天气很暖，我们站在江滩上都穿着单衣裳，一点风也没有，纸烟的烟就聚在嘴边不散。七点左右，部队都开到江边来了，船都出了河沟送到江面上了。部队分了许多梯队，一个梯队一百多只船，你看盖满江面全是船只，时间一到，所有的船都一起开动，上级命令：不许声张，不准吸烟，怕暴露目标。可是船一开动，江面上响出一片喊声，震天动地，谁也无法制止，所有的人一个个争先恐后，所有的船一只只飞快滑行，后面的人一只脚刚踏上船，前面的船已发出登陆的红色信号，……”伟大而雄壮的时代，就是今天，当我们想到它，谈起它的时候，它还像鹰一样在我们周围振翅飞翔呀！
    现在，让我们再转回到长江南岸来说说会师的那一刹那吧！
    目光炯炯的王安保（当时化名杨鹏，是长江沿岸一支游击队的负责人）同志讲道：
    “我和亚冰、慕思荣两同志到了红花山，山很大很高，一上山顶就看见长江上一片赤亮，就听见长江上一片轰轰的人声，江南面到处烧着一堆堆火，那是游击队员烧了给大军指路的。这时路上乱纷纷的到处都是人，敌军在狼狈溃逃，群众跑出来欢迎大军，亚冰、慕思荣叫我留下，他们就跑下山去了。”
    先遣部队在红花山前面的龙门山、大磕山和鸡头山三点上，冲过战斗的火光烟影，与渡江大军会师。那是21日黎明之前。当然这个黎明已不只是这一日的黎明，而是一个新世纪的黎明了，清澈的光辉从此照遍了大江以南的山岳和田野，压在中国人民脊背上的最后一个黑暗王朝，便在南京颓然倾倒，由此就完完全全的土崩瓦解了。
    我们这一回，沿着红花山下的公路驶向江边，攀登了大磕山。从山上俯视，长江两岸，尽在目中，江对面无为县境一片麦田葱绿，江中心的黑沙洲像一片绿色的绒毯，而几道江流如同几条白带，江这面当时登陆大军奋勇迈过的地方，现在出现了一条新的公路，正好从大磕山脚下经过，烟尘不断的飞扬，繁忙的卡车行列，正把江南一带的铁矿石送到江边，转上长江航运，片片白帆正在绿琉璃似的江面上印下好看的倒影。在这一刹那间，我仿佛看到了，从一个英雄的战争年代到一个英雄的建设年代，那清晰的路程。
    结束这段追寻英雄足迹的访问之后，我的脑海里，深深留下了对陈坦冲的印象，当初游击区的一个幽僻山村，现在变成了一个繁荣热闹的地点，河流潺潺，浓绿成荫，从中传出一片锯木声，碎石声，爆破声。大跃进的脚步在这儿震动了丛林深谷，人们在这儿开采矿石。特别醒目的是一扇大门的两旁，贴着一副红笺纸的对联，人们从劳动的热情中抒写了他们舒畅的诗意：
    工厂矿山春意浓，
    红旗烂缦舞东风。
    是的，东风吹出无限生机，碧绿的松林和鲜红的杜鹃在召引着我们，我们就一步步爬上了那高耸云天的云岭。
