Xinhua News Agency, 20th: New Delhi Dispatch: The Dalai Lama, who was abducted by rebels, entered India and is now heading to Mussoorie in Uttar Pradesh, the residence arranged for him by the Indian government, accompanied by Indian officials.

The Dalai Lama arrived in India on March 31st. On April 6th, the Indian government sent Menon, Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs and former Indian Consul-General in Lhasa, to Bomdila in the "Northeast Frontier Agency" of India to greet him. Subsequently, S. Sen, Joint Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs, was sent to Tezpur to assist with arrangements. In addition, the Indian government sent Dutt, Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs, and Mehta, Deputy Secretary, to Mussoorie to make arrangements.

According to the Press Trust of India, the Dalai Lama arrived in Bomdila on April 12th. He was greeted there by Menon and other Indian Foreign Ministry officials and local Political Commissioners. According to the news agency, the Dalai Lama held several talks with Menon starting on the 13th. "Bomdila contacted Delhi directly for the first time on the 14th with a high-powered radio transmitter to speed up the exchange of important telegrams."

The news agency reported on the 17th that officials said that the Dalai Lama was still unwilling to read a statement to reporters at that time, "but he is being persuaded to do so."

Subsequently, the Dalai Lama and his party arrived in Tezpur on the 18th in twenty-five jeeps provided by the Indian government, escorted by armed Assam troops. Among the large crowd waiting for him there were numerous journalists from Western countries and India, as well as Lhukangwa, a leader of Tibetan bandits abroad.

It was reported that the statement issued in the name of the Dalai Lama in Tezpur on the 18th was read in Tibetan by an attendant of the Dalai Lama, and the pre-printed English version of the statement was distributed to journalists by S. Sen, Joint Secretary of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.

Subsequently, the Indian authorities transported the Dalai Lama to Mussoorie by special car. Menon accompanied him.

Since the Dalai Lama entered India, the Indian government has taken what are described as "the most stringent security precautions." The "Northeast Frontier Agency" through which he passed has been designated as a restricted area, and no one is allowed to enter except for officials on official business and indigenous residents. In the Foothills region of Assam, private traffic is strictly prohibited, and detachments of the Assam Rifles have been dispatched to check travelers' identity cards. According to a Reuters dispatch from Mussoorie, the Dalai Lama's residence in Mussoorie will also be heavily guarded, with approximately three hundred Indian government plainclothes security and intelligence personnel making arrangements there. New Delhi has announced that journalists in Mussoorie can watch the Dalai Lama but cannot ask him questions.

    达赖喇嘛前往穆索里
    新华社20日讯　新德里消息：被叛乱分子劫持的达赖喇嘛进入印度以后，在印度官员的陪同下，正在前往印度政府给他安排作为居住地的北方邦的穆索里。
    达赖喇嘛是在3月31日到达印度的。印度政府在4月6日派了外交部副秘书、曾任印度驻拉萨总领事的梅农前往印度“东北边境特区”的邦迪拉迎接。随后，外交部的联合秘书斯·森被派到提斯浦尔去协助安排。此外，印度政府又派了外交部秘书杜特和副秘书梅塔前往穆索里进行安排。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，达赖喇嘛在4月12日到达邦迪拉。他在那里受到梅农和其他印度外交部官员和当地的政治专员等人的迎接。据这家通讯社报道，达赖喇嘛从13日起同梅农作了几次商谈，“邦迪拉在14日第一次直接用电力很强的无线电发报机同德里联系，以加速重要电讯的来往”。
    这家通讯社在17日报道，官方人士说，达赖喇嘛到那时还不愿向记者宣读声明，“但是他正在被说服这样做”。
    此后，达赖喇嘛一行由印度政府派了二十五辆吉普车，在武装的阿萨姆军队的护卫下，在18日到达提斯浦尔。在那里等待他的一大群人当中，除了为数众多的西方国家和印度等国的新闻记者以外，还有在国外的西藏叛匪首领鲁康娃。
    据报道，18日在提斯浦尔以达赖喇嘛名义发表的声明由达赖喇嘛的一个随员用藏语宣读，事先印好的声明的英文本由印度外交部联合秘书斯·森散发给新闻记者。
    随后，印度当局用专车把达赖喇嘛载往穆索里。梅农和他同行。
    在达赖喇嘛进入印度以后，印度政府一直采取了被称为“最严密的保安预防措施”。他经过的“东北边境特区”被划为禁区，除了有公事的官员和土著居民外，任何人不得进入。在阿萨姆邦的富特希耳斯地区，严禁私人交通来往，阿萨姆步兵的特遣队被派去检查旅行者的身份证。据路透社穆索里消息，达赖喇嘛在穆索里的住所也将戒备森严，大约有三百名印度政府的便衣保安和情报人员在那里进行安排。新德里已经宣布，新闻记者在穆索里可以观看达赖喇嘛，但不能向他提问题。
