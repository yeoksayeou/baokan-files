    Wu Xiulun Excavation Team
    Monthly Progress of Five Hundred Thirty-Five Point Five Meters

The Wu Xiulun rapid excavation team at the Quantai vertical shaft construction site in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, has been setting new records year after year, becoming a red banner for rapid coal mine tunnel construction. In September and November of last year, they successively set records of 115 and 161 meters of completed vertical shaft per month. In March of this year, they set a new record of 535.5 meters of single-heading progress in rock tunnels per month. This excavation team organized eight parallel work groups, adopting a multi-process parallel operation method, shortening non-production time. Working in three shifts, each shift transitioned from three cycles to four regular cycles, achieving a progress of 5.5 to 6.4 meters per shift. They used three pneumatic drills for drilling holes, and four to five for bottom holes, with multiple pneumatic drills drilling holes in different areas. The use of hollow blasting and large-diameter blasting greatly accelerated the excavation speed.

    建井新事
    吴修伦掘进队
    月进五百三十五点五公尺
    江苏徐州权台竖井建井工地吴修伦快速掘进队，连年创造新纪录，成为煤矿井巷快速施工的红旗。去年9月和11月份，先后创造了竖井井筒月进成井一百一十五和一百六十一公尺的纪录，今年3月份又创岩巷独头月进五百三十五点五公尺的新纪录。这个掘进队组织八个平行作业组，采取多工序平行作业法，缩短了非生产时间。三班作业，每班由进三个循环过渡到四个正规循环，达到班进五点五到六点四公尺。打眼用三台风钻，打底眼用四至五台，多台风钻分区打眼。采用空心爆破和大直径爆破，大大加快了掘进速度。
