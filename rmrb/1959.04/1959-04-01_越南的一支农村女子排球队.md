A Vietnamese Rural Women's Volleyball Team

A rural Vietnamese women's volleyball team, established in less than a year, surprisingly defeated all opponents in Ha Nam Province, Vietnam, and won the 1958 Ha Nam Province Women's Volleyball Championship, astonishing all spectators. This is the Vu Van Commune Women's Volleyball Team.

Perhaps some might think that there must be well-trained veterans on this team. In reality, apart from a female teacher who recently joined, the rest of the dozen or so players are all genuine farming girls. During the Vietnamese War of Resistance, they were young girls who frequently helped the guerrillas by standing guard and digging tunnels (the oldest is now only twenty-two years old); after the restoration of peace, they were active members of the production mutual aid teams, a group of people who were always eager to keep up. Vu Van Commune, which cultivated this thriving sports seedling, was once a heroic and staunch "guerrilla commune" behind enemy lines. It was awarded two Second-Class Resistance Medals and one Second-Class Labor Medal by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for its heroic fight against the enemy and outstanding production achievements. After the restoration of peace, this commune not only excelled in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, but was also a red flag in literacy and cultural and sports activities.

In May and June 1958, the Sports Commission of Ha Nam Province, Vietnam, was preparing to hold the provincial volleyball championships. After the news spread, the young men in each commune enthusiastically practiced volleyball in preparation for participating in the competition. A dozen or so girls from Vu Van Commune, including Lai Thi Ke, Pham Thi Vi, Pham Thi Van, Pham Thi Hy, Pham Thi Trinh, Pham Thi Toan, Pham Thi Thanh, and Pham Thi Diem, discussed playing volleyball when they met after returning from the fields. They said that during the French colonial rule in Vietnam, only Caucasians and the "upper class" had sports activities; during the War of Resistance, everyone was busy fighting the enemy; now is the time to build socialism, the government advocates sports activities, why don't we organize a volleyball team? Their idea was enthusiastically supported by the commune Party branch secretary, the Youth League branch secretary, and the mutual aid team. Comrade Khanh, a volleyball coach from the Sports Commission of Ha Nam Province, Vietnam, also expressed his willingness to often go to the countryside to help them after hearing this news. The team was organized, but they did not have a volleyball; the farm work was also very busy, with someone being unavailable today and another tomorrow. They borrowed the commune's soccer ball as a volleyball, and strived to practice during the short periods before and after mutual aid team meetings or other gatherings. Sometimes when they really couldn't squeeze out time during the day, they would practice late at night under the moonlight.

Now, the Vu Van Commune Women's Volleyball Team has been selected as the Ha Nam Province Women's Volleyball Team to participate in the 1959 Vietnam National Volleyball Championships, becoming the first rural women's volleyball team in Vietnamese history to participate in a national competition. They will compete against the 1958 national women's volleyball champion, the Hai Phong Seaport Women Workers' Volleyball Team, and also face six other teams with much more experience, such as the "Nam Dinh Textile Women Workers' Team," the "Ministry of Education Women Staff Team," and the "Hai Phong Southern Women Students' Team." While they were concentrated at the Sports Commission of Ha Nam Province, Vietnam, for two weeks of training, the villagers of Vu Van Commune often brought bananas and sugarcane to see "our commune's girls," repeatedly urging them to "just focus on practicing well, the mutual aid team will take care of the work in the fields for you."

Now the 1959 Vietnam National Volleyball Championships have begun, and people are watching the "Vu Van Commune Women's Volleyball Team" with the greatest interest, hoping that they will achieve greater victories in this competition. (Attached picture)

### 越南的一支农村女子排球队

    越南的一支农村女子排球队
    叶星
    一支成立不到一年的越南农村女子排球队，居然打败了越南河南省所有的对手，夺得了1958年河南全省女子排球冠军，使所有的观众大吃一惊。这就是伏云乡女子排球队。
    也许有人会这样想，这支球队中一定有训练有素的老手吧。实际上，十几个队员中，除了最近才入队的一位女教员外，其余都是不折不扣的种田盘地的姑娘。她们，在越南抗战期间是经常帮助游击队站岗放哨和挖地道的小姑娘（现在年龄最大的也只不过二十二岁）；和平恢复后，是生产变工组里的积极分子，是一群事事不甘落后的人。培育出这棵茁壮的体育幼苗的伏云乡，曾经是一个英勇坚强的敌后“游击乡”，它曾以英勇杀敌和出色的生产成绩，先后获得越南民主共和国政府颁给的两枚二级抗战勋章和一枚二级劳动勋章。和平恢复后，这个乡不但变工合作运动开展得好，在扫盲和开展文娱体育活动方面也是一面红旗。
    1958年5、6月间，越南河南省体育委员会筹备举办全省的排球锦标赛。消息传出来后，各乡的小伙子们都热火朝天地练排球，准备参加比赛。伏云乡赖氏计、范氏为、范氏云、范氏喜、范氏贞、范氏全、范氏清、范氏点等十几个姑娘，从地里回来碰到一起时，谈论起打排球的事。她们说，法国殖民者统治越南时，只有白种人和“上流人”才有体育活动；抗战期间大家忙着打敌人；现在是建设社会主义的时候了，政府提倡体育活动，我们也来组织个排球队行不行？她们的想法得到乡党支书、团支书和变工组的热烈支持。越南河南省体委会排球教练庆同志听到了这一消息，也表示愿意常常下乡帮助她们。球队组织起来了，但是她们没有排球；庄稼活又很忙，今天这个没空，明天那个不闲。她们把乡里的足球借来当排球用，争取在变工组开会或其他集会前后的短促时间练球，有时白天实在挤不出时间，就深夜在月光下练。
    现在，伏云乡女子排球队已被选拔为越南河南省女子排球代表队，参加1959年越南全国排球锦标赛，成为越南历史上参加全国性比赛的第一支农村女子排球队。她们将要同1958年全国女子排球冠军——海防海港女工排球队较量，还要同“南定纺织女工队”、“教育部女职工队”、“海防南方女学生队”等六个经验丰富得多的球队对阵。在她们集中到越南河南省体育委员会受两个星期训练的时候，伏云乡的乡亲们常常带上香蕉、甘蔗去看“咱们乡的女孩子们”，一再嘱咐她们“只管放心好好练球，地里的活变工组替你们包下来。”
    现在1959年越南全国排球锦标赛已经开始，人们都以最大的兴趣注视着“伏云乡女子排球队”，希望她们在这次竞赛中获得更大的胜利。（附图片）
