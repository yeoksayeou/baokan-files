Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 17th—The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is supporting Shandong, Anhui, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces with 30,000 famous Ili horses. Currently, it is actively handling the preparation work for purchasing and transferring the horses, and personnel from the four provinces have arrived in Xinjiang one after another to receive them.

Ili horses are produced in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang. According to historical records, this type of horse was transported to the Guanzhong area as early as the Han Wudi era, 2,100 years ago. Later, during the Tang Dynasty, large numbers were transported to Shaanxi, Gansu and other places for breeding, hence the name "Uyghur Horse." This horse is a hybrid of Xinjiang Kazakh horses and Soviet Don horses, English Thoroughbreds, and Orlov Trotters, and is deeply loved by the local Kazakh and other ethnic groups.

Ili horses have small and delicate heads, full and round withers, full chests, strong and powerful limbs, tall stature, and are fast and capable of carrying heavy loads. They can be ridden or used to pull carts. At present, the entire autonomous prefecture raises a total of six to seven hundred thousand Ili horses, and last year, approximately thirty thousand were transferred to support Henan, Shandong, and other provinces.

　　新疆调马支援山东等四省
　　三万匹伊犁高头大马不日登程
    新华社乌鲁木齐17日电　新疆维吾尔自治区支援山东、安徽、河南、陕西四省三万匹著名的伊犁高头大马。目前正积极办理收购、调运的准备工作，四省的接运人员也已陆续到达新疆。
    伊犁马产于新疆的伊犁哈萨克族自治州。据历史记载，这种马在二千一百年前的汉武帝时代，就运到过关中一带，后来又在唐代大批运往陕西、甘肃等地繁殖，故有“回纥马”之称。这种马是新疆哈萨克马和苏联顿河马、英顿马、奥洛夫马杂交配种繁育的，深受当地哈萨克等族人民的喜爱。
    伊犁马头部小而清秀，耆甲丰圆，前胸丰满，四肢坚实有力，体格高大，跑的快、载重多，可以乘骑，也可以拉车。目前全自治州共饲养伊犁马六、七十万匹，去年曾调出三万匹左右支援河南、山东等省。
