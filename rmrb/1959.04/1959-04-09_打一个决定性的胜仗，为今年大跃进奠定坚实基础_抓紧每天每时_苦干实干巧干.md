Beijing's Many Factories and Mines Have Been Producing at High Levels Every Day in the First Few Days of the Second Quarter.
Tianjin Paper Mill's Youth Group Has Been Creating Excellent Results for Several Days.

(Reported by this newspaper) After successfully completing their production plans for the first quarter, the workers in the capital, in April, have been engaging in a red flag emulation campaign of high production, high quality, and high efficiency. Through comparing, learning from, and catching up with the advanced, their enthusiasm has increased even more, and many factories have been overfulfilling their production plans every day.

The workers at the Iron Smelting Plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company have been setting new daily records for pig iron production every day since April 1st, and the utilization coefficient and smelting intensity of each blast furnace have also increased sharply. As of the 5th, they have already overproduced more than 900 tons of pig iron. Among them, No. 1 blast furnace has been producing an average of about 100 tons of pig iron more per day from the 1st to the 5th. The utilization coefficient of this blast furnace averaged 1.381 in March, and rose to an average of 1.587 in the first five days of April. The workers of the entire company are now finding competition targets inside and outside the company based on their types of work, affirming achievements, identifying shortcomings, and learning from advanced "pace-setters."

The Liulihe Cement Plant's output has been exceeding the production plan every day, with daily increases, up to the 8th. On the 6th, it overproduced 191 tons of cement, and on the 7th and 8th, the amount of cement overproduction rose to 250 tons. The quality is fully qualified. The employees of this plant overfulfilled their daily production plan despite tight transportation and insufficient lime supply.

The newly built Beijing Power Machinery Plant plans to trial-produce ten 5-horsepower diesel engines and one 64-kilowatt generator this month. As of the 7th, most of the parts have been manufactured, and it is expected that the trial production task can be completed five days ahead of schedule.

The various coal mines under the Jingsi Mining Bureau, whose coal production plan was increased by 11% compared to March, had completed 47% of the plan for the first ten days of the month by the 5th.

The workers of the Beijing No. 1, 2, and 3 Cotton Textile Mills have achieved new successes every day in the friendly competition between workers of the same type. After learning the advanced techniques demonstrated by Chen Ai'e, a member of the National Youth Workers Advanced Experience Observation Group, the output of fine yarn in the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill in the first two days of April exceeded the national plan by 6.2%, and the quality of secondary cloth caused by poor fine yarn was also significantly reduced. Now, these three factories are setting "pace-setters" in the competition, comparing with the advanced, and summarizing advanced experience.

According to statistics, in the first five days of this month, the North China Radio Equipment Factory, Guanghua Wood Factory, Knitting and Dyeing Factory, Xinhua Printing Factory, and other factories also completed 55% to 77% of their production plans for the first ten days of the month, respectively.

The "Three Highs" (high production, high quality, high efficiency) competition in Beijing's factories and mines is being carried out extensively and deeply. The enthusiasm for comparing with the advanced in various factories and mines is quickly reaching the point of "close quarters combat."

According to a report in the Tianjin Daily on the 7th: The Youth No. 1 Machine Group of the Tianjin Paper Mill, in response to the Party's call, launched a "Seven Comparisons" competition, racing against every second and ounce, and fully completed the national plan every shift and every day since April. At the same time, the group's important leap forward indicators have also been broken one after another, with an average daily overproduction of 1.8 tons of paper, and high quality and low consumption.

The Youth No. 1 Machine Group is a city-level model group. In order to fully complete the plan, the entire group of workers checked and summarized the achievements and experiences of the first quarter's competition. Based on the production characteristics of the factory, they supplemented and revised important indicators such as output, output value, quality, consumption, and safety, and researched 40 organizational and technical measures of various sizes. Then, on the basis of unified thinking, the entire group launched a "Seven Comparisons" competition between shifts, and took the lead in launching a challenge competition to all machine units in the factory.

The spearhead of the competition was first directed at quality control. On the 31st of last month, Liu Fuxing's team created a result of 360 reams of first-class products per shift (previously it was generally around 320 reams). On April 2nd, the workers of Jiao Fusheng's team strengthened the post responsibility system, and the output of first-class products per shift reached 367 reams, with only 5 reams of substandard products. This is the best result this group has ever achieved. However, the workers of Zhao Mingqi's team added the finishing touch after taking over, and they paid attention to adjusting the air pressure and pressure difference of the drying cylinder during operation, and created a new record of 371 reams of first-class products per shift with no substandard products. All the workers in the workshop were very excited. The workers of Jiao Fusheng's team carefully studied the operating experience of the previous shifts, and after taking over, they strengthened operation and increased speed. On the 4th, they created an excellent result of 373 reams of paper per shift, with no substandard products. In this way, the output of first-class products of the entire group has increased significantly. Now, the first-class products of each shift in the group generally reach 366 reams.

In order to increase the output of paper, the workers of the entire group launched a large-scale collaboration, striving to eliminate accidents, greatly reducing non-production time, and even the statutory downtime for replacing equipment was unprecedentedly shortened. On the 3rd, when replacing valuable equipment such as lower felt and washing upper felt, the planned downtime was three hours. Under the slogan of racing against every second, the entire group of workers made preparations in advance, each with its own responsibilities, and launched an orderly blitzkrieg during the handover, resulting in the end of the battle in only one hour and three minutes, and announced the start of the machine, producing nearly two tons more paper for the country. These provided favorable conditions for further extending the service life of valuable equipment, reducing downtime, increasing output, and reducing costs. (Attached picture)

    打一个决定性的胜仗，为今年大跃进奠定坚实基础
    抓紧每天每时　苦干实干巧干
    北京许多厂矿在第二季度头几天天天高产
    天津造纸总厂青年小组连日创造优异成绩
    本报讯　胜利完成了第一季度生产计划的首都工人，在进入4月份以后，在高产、高质、高效率的红旗竞赛中，通过比先进、学先进和赶先进，干劲更大了，许多工厂天天超额完成了生产计划。
    石景山钢铁公司炼铁厂的工人，从1日到现在，每天的生铁产量都日日翻新，各高炉的利用系数和冶炼强度也都猛烈上升。至5日止，已经超产生铁九百多吨。其中，一号高炉在1至5日平均每天多产生铁一百吨左右。这个高炉的利用系数3月份平均为一点三八一，4月份前五天平均上升到一点五八七。全公司的工人现正在公司内外按工种找竞赛对象，肯定成绩，找出缺点，向先进的“标兵”看齐。
    琉璃河水泥厂到8日止，产量天天超产，日日上升，6日超产水泥一百九十一吨，7、8两日水泥超产的幅度又都上升到二百五十吨。质量完全合格。这个厂的职工是在运输紧张、石灰供应不足的情况下超额完成日生产计划的。
    新建的北京市动力机械厂，本月份计划试制十台五马力的柴油机，一台六十四瓩的发电机，到7日止，绝大部分零件已经制成，预计可以提前五天完成试制任务。
    比3月份提高产煤计划11％的京西矿务局所属各煤矿，到5日已完成上旬计划的47％。
    北京第一、二、三棉纺织厂的工人们，在同工种的友谊竞赛中，每厂每天都取得了新的成就。北京第二棉纺织厂细纱工人学习了全国青年工人先进经验观摩团团员陈爱娥表演的先进技术以后，在4月份头两天的细纱产量就超过了国家计划的6.2％，因细纱不好而造成的次布质量也显著减少。现在这三个厂都在竞赛中立“标兵”，比先进，总结先进经验。
    据统计，在本月的头五天，华北无线电器材厂、光华木柴厂、机织印染厂、新华印刷厂等，也都分别完成了上旬生产计划的55％至77％。
    北京各厂矿的“三高”竞赛，正在广泛深入开展中，各厂矿的比先进热潮，已快到“短兵相接”的时候了。
    据天津日报7日消息：天津造纸总厂青年一号机小组，响应党的号召，开展“七比”竞赛，分秒必争，斤两不让，4月份以来，班班、日日全面完成国家计划。同时，小组重要的跃进指标也纷纷被突破，平均每天超产纸张一点八吨，而且质量高，消耗低。
    青年一号机小组是市级模范小组。为了全面完成计划，全组工人检查总结了第一季度竞赛的成绩和经验，根据本厂的生产特点，补充修订了产量、产值、质量、消耗、安全等重要指标，并研究出大小组织技术措施四十项。接着，全组在统一思想的基础上展开了班与班的“七比”竞赛，并一马当先向全厂各机台发起挑战竞赛。
    竞赛的矛头首先指向质量关。上月31日，刘福兴班创造了班产一等品三百六十令的成绩（以前一般在三百二十令左右），4月2日，焦福生班的工人加强岗位专责制，班产一等品达三百六十七令，等外品只有五令。这是这组从来没有的好成绩。但是赵明起班的工人接班后又锦上添花，他们在操作中注意调节烘缸气压和磅差，又创造了班产一等品三百七十一令，没有等外品的新纪录。全车间职工都很振奋。焦福生班的工人细致地研究了前几班的操作经验，接班后，一面加强操作，一面提高车速，4日，又创造了班产三百七十三令纸，无等外品的优异成绩。这样，全组出产的一等品大量增加了。现在全组各班一等品一般达到了三百六十六令。
    为了提高纸张的产量，全组工人展开大协作，努力消灭事故，大大地减少了非生产时间，就连更换器材等法定停机时间，也空前缩短。3日，更换下毛布和洗上毛布等贵重器材时，计划停车时间三小时，全组工人在分秒必争的口号下，事先就准备好了，各有专责，在交接班时展开了一场有条不紊的突击战，结果，只用一小时零三分钟就结束了战斗，宣告开车，为国家多生产了近两吨纸。这些都为进一步延长贵重器材的使用寿命，减少停机时间，增加产量，降低成本，提供了有利的条件。（附图片）
