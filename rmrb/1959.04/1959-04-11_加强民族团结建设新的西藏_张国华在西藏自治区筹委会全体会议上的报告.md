Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 10th. Zhang Guohua, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, delivered a report at the plenary session of the Preparatory Committee on the 8th. The full text is as follows:

Fellow Committee Members, Comrades:

In order to implement the State Council's order of March 28, 1959, we are holding the first plenary session of the Preparatory Committee exercising the functions and powers of the local government of Tibet today, under the personal chairmanship of Bainqen Erdini, Acting Director of the Preparatory Committee. The convocation of this meeting is of great historical significance for thoroughly quelling the rebellion in Tibet, further consolidating the unification of the motherland and strengthening the unity between all ethnic groups, and for building a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

At this meeting, we must first express our great anger at the treasonous acts of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group in colluding with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, gathering rebel bandits and other counter-revolutionaries, persecuting the people, abducting the Dalai Lama, tearing up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and openly launching a full-scale armed attack on the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa on March 19, 1959. At the same time, it must be pointed out that their treasonous acts of betraying the motherland, undermining the unification of the motherland, undermining national unity, and violating the will of the Tibetan people did not develop to such a rampant degree by chance, but were premeditated for a long time.

When the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet was signed in 1951, the Central Government made huge concessions to the former Tibetan local government. The main requirement in the agreement was that the former Tibetan local government resolutely break away from imperialist control and unite with all ethnic groups in the great family of the People's Republic of China. As for the handling of internal relations and internal affairs in Tibet, the Central Government, based on its established policy of national equality and unity, adopted an extremely broad, tolerant, and waiting attitude. Even so, the upper-class reactionaries in Tibet did their best to oppose the implementation of the agreement; as for the former Tibetan local government, although it repeatedly expressed its support for the implementation of the agreement in letters and telegrams and verbally, it actually used various excuses to obstruct the implementation of the agreement, so that some important clauses of the agreement could not be implemented. For example, the important tasks of reforming the Tibetan social system, i.e., the serf system, according to the wishes of the people, and reorganizing the Tibetan army, were all allowed to be postponed by the Central Government in order to wait for their awakening. Originally, Article 15 of the agreement also stipulated the establishment of a military and political committee, but the Central Government, based on its broad-mindedness, tolerance, and waiting attitude, agreed not to establish a military and political committee and to establish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. However, due to the obstruction of the reactionary elements in the Tibetan local government, the preparatory work for the autonomous region has been very difficult to carry out. Regarding the reorganization of the Tibetan army, the former Tibetan local government once automatically proposed to reduce the size of the Tibetan army in its report to the State Council in 1954, and requested the State Council to send cadres to conduct training. However, in the four years since then, the former Tibetan local government has not only failed to fulfill its promise, but on the contrary, it has gathered rebel bandits and expanded the Tibetan army.

It is certain that all ethnic groups in our country must carry out social reforms and take the socialist road. However, the time, steps, and methods of reform should be determined according to the specific conditions of each ethnic group. This spirit is stipulated in Article 11 of the agreement. However, the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet stubbornly opposed social reform, and the former Tibetan local government actually adopted an attitude of opposition to reform. As a result, the Tibetan serf system has not changed at all to this day, and the lives of the Tibetan people are still very hard. In order to promote the awakening of the former Tibetan local government, the Central Government patiently negotiated and waited. However, the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group were not satisfied, but instead arrogantly carried out activities of "never changing" and took further steps. All of this shows that the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group have always disregarded the interests of the broad masses of monks and lay people in Tibet and fundamentally opposed the agreement and opposed reforming the Tibetan serf system. However, due to the increasing prosperity and strength of the motherland, the correctness of the Central Government's policy towards Tibet, the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army and working personnel entering Tibet, and the conscientious implementation of the Party and the Central People's Government's policies of national equality and unity, freedom of religious belief, and other policies, they have been loved by the people of all circles in Tibet. Therefore, the conspiracy of the Tibetan traitors, instigated by imperialists and foreign reactionaries, to separate Tibet from the motherland and implement so-called "independence" has not received the support of the Tibetan people and is increasingly isolated. However, they did not lay down their butcher knives and stop their rebellion activities because of this, but instead resolutely embarked on the dead end of self-destruction.

In 1952, Luokangwa and Luosang Zhaxi, the Sicao of the former Tibetan local government, gathered some reactionary elements to organize a pseudo "People's Conference," plotting to launch a counter-revolutionary riot, openly opposing the Seventeen-Article Agreement, and raising reactionary slogans such as "The People's Liberation Army withdraws from Tibet." The former Tibetan local government not only did not take any serious action on this, but many facts show that they were actually colluding with each other and providing these pseudo "People's Conference" elements with various support.

A large amount of material obtained in the suppression of the rebellion proves that the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet have close ties with the rebel elements in the former Xikang Province; the armed rebellion was planned single-handedly by the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet. Therefore, when some remnant rebel bandits from the former Xikang Province sneaked into Tibet and colluded with the Tibetan rebel elements, robbing, raping, killing, destroying roads, intercepting cars, killing Tibetan and Han cadres and patriotic progressive people, attacking the People's Liberation Army, disrupting social order in Tibet, and endangering the safety of the people's lives and property, the former Tibetan local government not only did not take any effective measures, but instead increasingly intensified its support for the rebel elements, providing for the rebel elements, and arming the rebel elements. The rebel elements in Tibet could obtain the guns, ammunition, grain, and all other supplies stored by the former Tibetan local government everywhere. Some officials, Tibetan soldiers, and lamas from temples led by the former Tibetan local government openly took the weapons issued to them by the former Tibetan local government to participate in the rebel bandits. On the other hand, the traitorous group headed by Luokangwa, Xiagaba, Jiale Dunzhu, and Alequnzhe, who lived in Kalimpong, carried out various rebellious activities against the motherland under the instigation and support of imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, and directed and supported the rebel elements in the Tibetan area to carry out armed rebellion. In response, the Central Government repeatedly patiently educated the former Tibetan local government, hoping that the former Tibetan local government would draw a clear line with them. In fact, the former Tibetan local government has always supported, condoned, and participated in the planning of their activities of betraying the motherland. Therefore, although the former Tibetan local government falsely made a so-called decision to expel these people from the scope of the Tibetan people, it could not conceal their collusion and conspiracy to betray the motherland.

During the Chuanzhao period in 1959, a series of treasonous incidents occurred, such as the Tibetan army led by the former Tibetan local government deliberately arresting Central Government personnel in Tibet and conducting illegal interrogations; surrounding the CPC Tibet Working Committee and various agencies stationed in Lhasa with guns more than once; distributing reactionary leaflets, spreading rumors and deceiving, inciting the masses, and carrying out conspiratorial activities against the Central Government. For the sake of national unity and waiting for the former Tibetan local government to awaken, the Central Government adopted an attitude of repeated concessions.

The March 10, 1959 incident was caused single-handedly by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary elements after a long period of planning and preparation. Their treasonous activities reached their peak, openly clamoring for "Tibetan independence"; injuring Sangpo Tenzin Dondup, Deputy Commander of the Tibet Military Region, on the spot; killing the patriotic lama Pabala Soinam Gyatso, who opposed their rebellion, and threatening the masses to drag his body for a parade; shouting reactionary slogans such as "Tibetan independence" and "The People's Liberation Army withdraws from Tibet." Under such circumstances, the Central Government still adopted a broad attitude and made a final effort. General Tan Guansan, Acting Representative of the Central Government in Tibet, sent letters to the Dalai Lama on March 10, 11, and 15 respectively, and sent letters to the former Tibetan local government, asking the former Tibetan local government to take responsibility and stop the rebellion. However, the treasonous activities of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group increased rather than decreased; they threatened Tibetan cadres, teachers, students, and officials working in the Preparatory Committee organs in various ways, demanding that they surrender and repent to their so-called "Independent Tibetan State" within a time limit; forcing and deceiving women to march, forcing Tibetan monks and lay people to participate in the rebellion, ordering the registration of men aged sixteen to sixty; arming temple lamas; robbing people of their property everywhere; destroying national defense roads, bridges, and water gates; cutting off telephone poles and wires; burning down the houses of the Central Government agencies stationed in Tibet; openly posting reactionary "proclamations" in the name of the "People's Congress of the Independent Tibetan State"; organizing the "Volunteer Army Headquarters for the Defense of Religion," appointing traitorous military leaders, and ordering the gathering of rebel armed forces from all parts of Tibet; surrounding the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa and the Central Government agencies in Lhasa. What is particularly serious is that they ignored the repeated warnings of the Central Government and mistakenly regarded the Central Government's attitude of broad-mindedness and repeated concessions, adopted for the sake of national unity, for the sake of the interests of the Tibetan people, waiting for the former Tibetan local government to finally change its mistakes, and waiting for the traitorous elements to rein in their horses and turn back, as "weakness and incompetence," and arrogantly thought that their handful of armed rebellions by feudal serf owners, who would eventually be completely isolated among the Tibetan people, would be fortunate enough to win a victory, and openly abducted the Dalai Lama on March 17 and launched a full-scale armed attack on the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa and the Central Government agencies in Tibet on the night of March 19. The hope for a peaceful settlement has been completely destroyed by the Tibetan traitors, and the Tibetan reactionary forces have finally chosen the path of self-destruction. In order to consolidate the unification of the motherland, in order to safeguard national unity, and for the complete liberation of the Tibetan working people, the Central Government ordered the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet on March 20 to suppress the traitorous group in Tibet. At present, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet are actively supported by the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, especially the Tibetan people, in order to complete this glorious task. After quickly quelling the rebellion in the Lhasa area, they are continuing to victoriously quell the armed rebellion in some other areas.

In view of the fact that many people in the rebel armed forces were abducted, coerced, and deceived to participate, in the process of suppressing the rebellion, the Central Government still adopts the policy of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced will not be held accountable, and meritorious service will be rewarded." Those who leave the rebel bandits and return are not held accountable; those who have made meritorious service are rewarded; a policy of preferential treatment is implemented for prisoners of war, including no killing, no insults, no beatings, and no searching of pockets. The People's Liberation Army troops, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government, widely unite all Tibetan compatriots who have not participated in the rebellion, protect the safety of the lives and property of the people in the agricultural, pastoral, industrial, commercial, political, and religious circles, protect Lama temples and cultural relics and historic sites, protect foreign nationals who abide by Chinese laws, respect the customs and habits of the Tibetan people of all ethnic groups, and protect freedom of religious belief. However, the protection of freedom of religious belief must never be confused with guaranteeing freedom of counter-revolutionary activities, and the protection of freedom of religious belief must never be interpreted as allowing a reactionary element to engage in armed rebellion and betray the motherland just by wearing a cassock, and to arbitrarily plunder, abuse, and kill the Tibetan people, and to have various special privileges for illegal and criminal activities.

The armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group in collusion with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries in Tibet, contrary to their wishes, did not cause the division of the motherland and the regression of Tibet, but promoted the consolidation of the unification of the motherland, the destruction of the Tibetan reactionary forces, the democratization of Tibet, and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.

Fellow Committee Members, Comrades: In order to thoroughly quell the rebellion, further consolidate the unification of the motherland, strengthen national unity, and completely liberate the Tibetan people, we must closely unite the broad masses of monks and lay people in Tibet and all patriotic and progressive forces, resolutely implement the glorious tasks entrusted to us in the State Council's order of March 28, 1959, and strive together to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet!

　　加强民族团结建设新的西藏
　　张国华在西藏自治区筹委会全体会议上的报告
    新华社拉萨10日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员张国华8日在筹委会全体委员会议上的报告，全文如下：各位委员、各位同志：
    为了贯彻执行国务院1959年3月28日的命令，今天在西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼的亲自主持下，召开了筹委会行使西藏地方政府职权的第一次全体委员会议，这次会议的召开，对于彻底平定西藏叛乱，进一步巩固祖国统一和加强各族人民之间的团结，对于建设民主和社会主义的新西藏有着重大的历史意义。
    在这次会议上，我们首先对原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，纠集叛匪和其他反革命分子，残害人民，劫持达赖喇嘛，撕毁和平解放西藏的十七条协议，公然在1959年3月19日向人民解放军驻拉萨部队发动全面武装进攻等背叛祖国的罪恶行为，表示极大的愤怒，同时还必须指出，他们这种背叛祖国、破坏祖国统一，破坏民族团结，违反西藏人民意志的罪恶行为之所以发展到如此猖狂的地步，绝非出于偶然，而是蓄谋已久的。
    在1951年签订和平解放西藏办法的协议时，中央就对原西藏地方政府作了巨大的让步，在协议中主要要求原西藏地方政府坚决脱离帝国主义羁绊，在中华人民共和国祖国大家庭中跟各族人民一致团结起来。而对西藏内部关系和内部事务的处理，中央则一本既定的民族平等团结政策，采取了极为宽大、容忍等待的态度。即使这样，西藏上层反动分子仍然竭力反对协议的实行；至于原西藏地方政府虽然曾在函电中和口头上一再表示拥护执行协议，然而实际上却以各种借口阻挠协议的实行，以致协议中一些重要条款未能付诸实施。例如对于西藏社会制度，即农奴制度要按人民的愿望加以改革，对于藏军要实行改编等重要任务，中央为了等待他们的觉悟，都准予暂缓执行。本来协议第十五条还规定了设立军政委员会，中央也本着宽大为怀、容忍等待的态度，同意了不再设立军政委员会，成立西藏自治区筹委会，但是由于西藏地方政府中反动分子的阻挠，自治区的筹备工作，却也一直很难进行。关于藏军的改编问题，1954年原西藏地方政府给国务院的报告中曾经自动提出缩编藏军，并请国务院派干部进行训练，但是四年以来原西藏地方政府不仅没有履行自己的诺言，相反，却纠集叛匪扩充了藏军。
    我国各民族都必须进行社会改革，走社会主义道路，这是肯定不移的。但是改革的时间、步骤和方式，应当根据各民族的具体条件去决定。这个精神在协议第十一条中已有规定。但是西藏的上层反动分子却一味反对社会改革，而原西藏地方政府对于改革在实际上也是采取反对的态度。致使西藏农奴制度至今丝毫没有改变，西藏人民的生活，至今仍然很苦。中央为了促使原西藏地方政府觉悟，还是耐心地协商等待。但是西藏地方政府和上层反动集团还不满足，却得寸进尺地狂妄地进行什么“永远不改”的活动。所有这些，都说明原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团是一贯不顾西藏广大僧俗人民的利益，根本反对协议，反对改革西藏的农奴制度的。但由于祖国的日益繁荣昌盛，中央对西藏政策正确，进藏人民解放军和工作人员纪律严明，认真执行了党和中央人民政府的民族平等团结、宗教信仰自由和其他政策，受到了西藏各界人民的爱戴，因而西藏叛国分子在帝国主义和外国反动派策动下，使西藏脱离祖国，实行所谓“独立”的阴谋得不到西藏人民的支持，并且日益陷于孤立的地位。可是他们并没有因此放下屠刀，停止叛乱活动，却反而坚决走向自取灭亡的死路。
    1952年原西藏地方政府的司曹鲁康娃和洛桑扎西所纠集的一部分反动分子就组织了伪“人民会议”，阴谋发起反革命暴动，公然反对十七条协议，提出“人民解放军撤出西藏”等反动口号。对此，原西藏地方政府不仅未作任何认真处理，而且许多事实都说明实际上他们是相互勾结并给予这些伪“人民会议”分子以各方面支援的。
    在平定叛乱中所获得的大量材料，证明西藏上层反动分子和原西康省地区的叛乱分子是有密切联系的；武装叛乱是西藏上层反动分子所一手策划的。所以当原西康省地区的一部分残余叛匪窜入西藏和西藏叛乱分子勾结一起，到处抢劫，奸淫烧杀，破坏公路，截击汽车，杀害藏、汉族干部和反帝爱国进步人士，袭击人民解放军，破坏西藏社会治安，危害人民生命财产安全的时候，原西藏地方政府不但不作任何有效的处置，反而日益变本加厉地支持叛乱分子，供养叛乱分子，武装叛乱分子。叛乱分子在西藏地区可以到处得到原西藏地方政府所贮藏的枪弹、粮食和其他一切物资。原西藏地方政府所领导的一些官员、藏军和寺庙喇嘛竟公然带着原西藏地方政府发给他们的武器，去参加叛匪。另一方面住在噶伦堡的以鲁康娃、夏格巴、嘉乐顿珠、阿乐群则等为首的叛国集团，在帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派的指使和支持下，对祖国进行种种叛逆活动，指挥和支援藏区的叛乱分子进行武装叛乱。对此，中央屡次耐心教育原西藏地方政府，希望原西藏地方政府同他们划清界限。而实际上原西藏地方政府对他们背叛祖国的活动却一直支持、纵容和参与策划。所以原西藏地方政府虽然曾虚伪地作了一个所谓把这些人从西藏人民范围内开除出去的决定，也丝毫不能掩盖他们相互勾结、阴谋进行背叛祖国的罪行。
    1959年传召期间，发生了一连串的叛国事件，如原西藏地方政府所领导的藏军故意逮捕中央在藏工作人员，进行非法审讯；不止一次地持枪包围中共西藏工委和驻拉萨各机关；散发反动传单，造谣欺骗，煽动群众，进行反对中央的阴谋活动。中央为了民族团结，为了等待原西藏地方政府觉悟，都采取了再三忍让的态度。
    1959年3月10日事件，是原西藏地方政府和上层反动分子，经过长期策划和准备而一手造成的。他们的叛国活动达到了登峰造极，公然叫嚣“西藏独立”；当场打伤西藏军区副司令员桑颇·才旺仁增；打死反对他们叛乱的爱国喇嘛帕巴拉·索朗降措，并威胁群众拖尸游行；高呼“西藏独立”，“人民解放军撤出西藏”等反动口号。在这种情况下，中央还是一本宽大的态度，作最后的努力。中央驻藏代理代表谭冠三将军先后于3月10日，11日和15日给达赖喇嘛去信，并给原西藏地方政府去了信，要原西藏地方政府负起责任，制止叛乱。可是，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所进行的叛国活动却有增无减；多方威胁藏族的干部、教职员、学员和在筹委会机关工作的官员，要他们限期向其所谓“西藏独立国”自首悔过；强迫欺骗妇女游行，强迫西藏僧俗人民参加叛乱，对十六岁到六十岁的男子勒令登记；武装寺庙喇嘛；到处抢劫人民财物；破坏国防公路、桥梁、水闸；砍截电线杆和电线；烧毁中央驻西藏机关的房屋；公开以“西藏独立国人民扩大会议”名义张贴反动“布告”；组织“卫教志愿军司令部”，委派叛国军事首脑，下令纠集西藏各地的叛乱武装；包围人民解放军驻拉萨部队和中央驻拉萨机关。尤其严重的是他们竟不顾中央的一再警告，错误地把中央为了民族团结，为了西藏人民的利益，等待原西藏地方政府最后改变错误，等待叛国分子悬崖勒马悔悟回头而采取的宽大为怀再三忍让的态度，视为“软弱无能”，狂妄地以为他们一小撮终将在西藏人民群众中陷于完全孤立地位的封建农奴主的武装叛乱，会侥幸取得胜利，公然于3月17日劫走达赖喇嘛，并于3月19日夜间向人民解放军驻拉萨部队和中央在西藏机关，发动了全面武装进攻。和平解决的希望已被西藏叛国分子彻底毁灭了，西藏反动势力最后选定了使他们自取灭亡的道路。为了巩固祖国统一，为了维护民族团结，为了西藏劳动人民的彻底解放，中央于3月20日命令人民解放军驻西藏部队讨伐西藏的叛国集团。目前人民解放军驻西藏部队为完成这一光荣任务，在全国各族人民尤其是西藏人民的积极支援下，在迅速平息了拉萨地区叛乱后，正继续胜利地平息其他一些地区的武装叛乱。
    鉴于在叛乱武装中有很多人是被劫持、裹胁欺骗参加的，在平息叛乱过程中，对叛乱分子，中央仍然采取“首恶必办、胁从不问、立功受奖”的政策，对脱离叛匪来归者，一律不咎既往；有立功表现者，给予奖励、对俘虏实行优待的政策，不杀、不辱不打、不搜腰包。人民解放军部队遵照中央指示，广泛地团结一切没有参加叛乱的藏族同胞，保护农、牧、工、商、政、教界人民的生命财产的安全，保护喇嘛寺庙和文物古迹，保护遵守中国法律的外国侨民，尊重西藏各族人民的风俗习惯，保护宗教信仰自由。但是绝对不能把保护宗教信仰自由和保障反革命活动的自由混同起来，决不能把保护宗教信仰自由，解释为，一个反动分子，只要披上一领袈裟，就可以武装叛乱，背叛祖国，就可以对藏族人民任意进行掠夺、虐害、残杀，可以有各种违法犯罪的特权。
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派在西藏所发动的武装叛乱，同他们的愿望相反，不是造成了祖国的分裂和西藏的倒退，而是促进了祖国统一的巩固，促进了西藏反动势力的灭亡，促进了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。
    委员们、同志们：为彻底平息叛乱，进一步巩固祖国统一，加强民族团结，彻底解放西藏人民，我们必须紧密地团结西藏广大僧俗人民和一切爱国进步力量，坚决贯彻执行国务院1959年3月28日命令中所交予我们的光荣任务，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而共同奋斗！
