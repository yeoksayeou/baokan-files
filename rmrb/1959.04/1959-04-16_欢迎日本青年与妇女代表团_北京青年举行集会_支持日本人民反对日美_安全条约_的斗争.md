Xinhua News Agency, April 15th. The youth of the capital held a rally yesterday to welcome the Japanese Youth and Women's Delegation that recently visited our country.

Zhang Chao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, expressed warm welcome to the Japanese guests on behalf of the All-China Youth Federation and Chinese youth at the meeting. He said that the Chinese people and youth distinguish between the Nobusuke Kishi government, which is hostile to China, and the people and youth of Japan. We will always treat our friends with sincerity, regard their struggles and victories as our own, and always give them sympathy and support. Zhang Chao said that the Kishi Nobusuke government is attempting to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," in a vain attempt to further revive Japanese militarism and realize its ambition to re-involve itself in our territory of Taiwan and expand into Southeast Asia. In order to oppose this conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, Japanese youth, together with the Japanese people, have launched a massive national struggle against the revision and demanding the abrogation of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." April 15th is the "National Unified Action Day" of this struggle. Chinese youth express their firm support for the just struggle of the Japanese people and youth to defend peace and strive for national independence and democracy, and sincerely congratulate the Japanese people and youth for achieving greater victories in this struggle.

Sadao Utsunomiya, head of the Japanese Youth and Women's Delegation, spoke at the meeting. He said that the Kishi Nobusuke government, disregarding the will of the Japanese people, is determined to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Its purpose is to make Japan act as a vanguard for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Asia, arm Japan with nuclear weapons, and conclude a Northeast Asia military alliance. We, the youth and women of Japan, are determined "never to take up guns again," "never to send husbands and lovers to the battlefield again," and "never to invade other countries again," and to stand at the forefront of the struggle for the right to life, peace, and independence.

After the speech, the conference read out a telegram from the All-China Youth Federation to the Japan Youth and Student Joint Struggle Conference.

    欢迎日本青年与妇女代表团
    北京青年举行集会
    支持日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争
    新华社15日讯　首都青年昨天集会欢迎最近来我国访问的日本青年与妇女代表团。
    中华全国青年联合会副主席张超在会上代表全国青联和中国青年对日本客人表示热烈欢迎。他说，中国人民和青年是把敌视中国的岸信介政府和日本的人民、青年区别对待的。我们对于朋友永远竭诚相待，把他们的斗争和胜利看成自己的斗争和胜利，永远给以同情和支持。张超说，岸信介政府企图修改日美“安全条约”，妄图进一步复活日本军国主义、实现它重新染指我国领土台湾和向东南亚扩张的野心。为了反对美日反动派的这种阴谋，日本青年和日本人民一道，掀起了声势浩大的反对修改和要求废除日美“安全条约”的国民斗争，4月15日是这一斗争的“全国统一行动日”，中国青年表示坚决支持日本人民和青年为保卫和平，争取民族独立、民主而进行的正义斗争，并且衷心祝贺日本人民和青年在这一斗争中取得更大的胜利。
    日本青年与妇女代表团团长宇都宫贞夫在会上讲了话。他说，岸信介政府不顾日本人民的意志，硬要修改日美“安全条约”，其目的是要使日本充当美帝国主义侵略亚洲的先锋，用核武器武装日本，缔结东北亚军事同盟。我们日本的青年和妇女决心“不再拿枪”，“不再送丈夫和情人上战场”，“不再侵略别的国家”，而站在争取生活权利与和平独立斗争的前列。
    讲话以后，大会宣读了中华全国青年联合会给日本青年、学生共同斗争会议的电文。
