I fully agree with and wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the CPPCC Standing Committee. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our achievements in the ten years since the founding of the nation are unprecedented. The over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has laid the material foundation for our socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, with the multiplied increases in steel, coal, grain, and cotton, has driven the overall rise of other industrial and agricultural products. Such a high rate of development is the result of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, unattainable by the capitalist system. Due to the continuous development of productivity and the continuous improvement of the people's political consciousness, the rural people's communes, the basic-level organizations, were subsequently established. This has indeed created the best organizational form for the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist public ownership, and from socialist society to communist society. The implementation of a distribution system combining wages and supply systems in rural people's communes has not only completely eliminated the phenomenon of farmers worrying about food and clothing, which had existed for thousands of years in the old society, but also provided social insurance for the gradual improvement of farmers' lives in the future. The worker brothers in the cities are also generally consciously working and not counting rewards. Everywhere there is a leap forward upsurge, and everywhere there is a new atmosphere. The unbreakable unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the new type of international relations of mutual support and mutual improvement, are a strong fortress of peace; the Soviet Union's earth satellites and artificial planets are the first to go to heaven, and the economies, politics, culture, and technology of all socialist countries are developing at high speed. This has struck a blow to the war-mongers' aggressive conspiracies, ensured the peaceful labor of the people of socialist countries, maintained world peace, and also encouraged the unprecedented upsurge of national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. As Chairman Mao said, the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. Like the people of the whole country, I am deeply grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for leading us so well, leading us to victory after victory, happiness upon happiness. The working people of the whole world are also cheering for us.

Our socialist construction and socialist transformation are carried out simultaneously. Since the speed of construction is advancing rapidly, the ideological remolding of old intellectuals is inevitably required to be higher. It is not only required to fundamentally transform from the original bourgeois stand to the working-class side, but also, as Chairman Mao said, to continue to advance, gradually establish a communist worldview in their work and study, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism, and gradually integrate with workers and peasants. If it is believed that old intellectuals, as a class, will attach themselves to feudal landlords if they do not attach themselves to the bourgeoisie, and will attach themselves to the working class if they do not attach themselves to the bourgeoisie, and that in the present situation where capitalist ownership of the means of production has been basically eliminated, there is no concrete bourgeoisie to attach to, and therefore they will only attach themselves to the working class, that is wrong. It should be known that whether a class exists or not, whether or not it occupies the means of production is only one of the signs, and the main thing is whether the class's political ideology has been fundamentally transformed. The education received by old intellectuals is mainly capitalist education, permeated with a bourgeois worldview, and their political theory is to establish a bourgeois republic in China. Old intellectuals are politically sensitive. When old intellectuals saw China suffer from the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in the past, most of them were dissatisfied and expressed themselves as patriots, a small number of whom became Marxists-Leninists, and most of whom were bourgeois intellectuals. A few others attached themselves to the above-mentioned reactionary classes. When old intellectuals recently saw that the working class was going to lead the masses of the people from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, the class struggle manifested on the political and ideological fronts showed more intense and acute contradictions between them and the working class than between ordinary bourgeois elements and the working class. Thus, a few became leftists, most were centrists, and another small part degenerated into rightists. Such vacillation and differentiation of old intellectuals require them to intensify their self-ideological remolding to varying degrees so that they can politically attach themselves to the working class. The bourgeois individualism of old intellectuals is also fundamentally incompatible with socialist collectivism; the old intellectuals' monopoly of knowledge and detachment from manual labor are also contradictory to the socialist and communist principle of combining manual and mental labor. Therefore, old intellectuals must intensify their study of political theory, especially carefully study Chairman Mao's works, and deeply understand the Party and government's policies and guidelines as well as domestic and international current affairs. In their jobs, through business practice and social practice, they must constantly carry out the struggle between two roads, two outlooks on life, and two methods, and constantly use the six criteria mentioned by Chairman Mao to examine their own thoughts, pull out the white flag, and plant the red flag. At any time, confide in the Party, say whatever you have, say whatever you think, so that you can rely on the Party's leadership and help to accelerate the transformation of your thoughts. Actively participate in manual labor, go to the masses of workers and peasants, experience the thoughts and feelings of workers and peasants, learn from the workers and peasants, absorb the endless wisdom there, overcome your own subjectivity, one-sidedness, and self-interest at the expense of others, and gradually achieve "intellectualization of the working people" and "knowledge of the working people," and gradually shorten the distance between mental and manual labor, thereby promoting the complete unity of knowledge and labor. Obviously, ideological remolding is complex, arduous, long-term, and necessary. I personally did not grasp it tightly in the past, and I changed very slowly. I must correct it in the future and use our good twilight years to restore our second youth.

We old comrades who participated in the Revolution of 1911, although we once rejoiced in the overthrow of China's thousands of years of feudal autocratic rule, we all painfully regretted that the fruits of the Revolution of 1911 were successively stolen by the Northern Warlords and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, placing the people in dire straits for decades. It was not until the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to victory in the New Democratic Revolution that the ideals of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the revolutionary mentor of our country, were realized, the tradition of the Chinese revolution was inherited, and the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory, which is universally applicable, was combined with the specific conditions of the Chinese revolution to continue the socialist revolution. Therefore, we have the above-mentioned unprecedented achievements. I hope that those patriots who have been deceived will wake up and turn back in time. The reason why the Revolution of 1911 ultimately failed was that there was no leadership of the Communist Party at that time. The key to the continuous victory of the New Democratic Revolution and the Socialist Revolution lies in the leadership of the Communist Party. This is separated by half a century, and countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives before we, the people, finally found the direction of the revolution and its leader. Therefore, we must cherish and support the leadership of the Party, listen to Chairman Mao, and resolutely and unanimously take the socialist road.

    晚景甚好　青春可再
    熊秉坤委员的发言
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告和李维汉副主席所作的政协常委工作报告。在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，建国十年来，我们的成就是史无前例的，发展国民经济第一个五年计划的超额完成，奠定了我们社会主义革命和社会主义建设的物质基础，一九五八年工农业大跃进，钢、煤、粮、棉都在加翻的增产，带动其余工农业产品普遍的上涨，这样高的发展速度是社会主义制度无比优越的成果，是资本主义制度所望尘莫及的。由于生产力的不断发展，人民政治觉悟的不断提高，所以接着成立了农村人民公社的基层组织。这确为我们社会主义的集体所有制过渡到社会主义的全民所有制、社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会，创造了最好的组织形式。在农村人民公社中实行工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度，不仅完全消灭了几千年来农民在旧社会中的愁吃愁喝现象，而且提供了今后逐步提高农民生活的社会保险。城市的工人弟兄也普遍的自觉劳动，不计报酬。到处有跃进高潮，满眼是新兴气象。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的牢不可破的团结，相互支援相互提高的新型国际关系，是和平的坚强堡垒；苏联的地球卫星和人造行星都是第一个先上天，所有社会主义国家的经济政治和文化技术都在高速度的发展，这就打击了战争贩子的侵略阴谋，保障了社会主义各国人民的和平劳动，保住了世界和平，也鼓舞着亚、非、南美各地民族解放运动的空前高涨，诚如毛主席说的敌人是在一天一天的烂下去，我们是在一天一天的好起来。我同全国人民一样都以兴奋愉快的心情，深深地感谢共产党和毛主席领导得好，把我们引向胜利接着胜利，幸福更加幸福，全世界的劳动人民也都为我们欢欣鼓舞。
    我们的社会主义建设与社会主义改造是同时进行的。建设的速度既然是一日千里，因此，对旧知识分子的思想改造也必然要求的比较高，不仅要求从原来的资产阶级立场根本改造到工人阶级方面来，并且要求正如毛主席说的继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片。假如认为旧知识分子这个阶层，不附着封建地主就附着资产阶级，不附着资产阶级就会附着工人阶级，在生产资料资本主义所有制已经基本消灭的现在，既没有具体的资产阶级可附了，当然只会归附于工人阶级，那是错误的。要知道作为阶级是否存在的条件，生产资料占有与否只是标志之一，而主要是其阶级的政治思想是否已经获得了根本改造。旧知识分子所受的教育，主要都是资本主义的教育，浸透了资产阶级的世界观，而其政治理论是想在中国建立资产阶级的共和国。旧知识分子在政治上是敏感的，当旧知识分子过去看到中国遭受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义压迫的时候，他们多数是不满的，表现为爱国主义者，其中有一小部分人成为马列主义者，多数人则为资产阶级的知识分子。另有少数人归附上述反动阶级。当旧知识分子近期看到工人阶级要领导人民大众从民主革命转入社会主义革命的时候，表现在政治战线和思想战线上的阶级斗争，他们就比一般资产阶级分子同工人阶级的矛盾，显得激烈和尖锐，于是少数成为左派，大多数是中间派，而另一部分少数沦为右派。旧知识分子这样摇摆与分化，都需要在不同程度上，加紧自我思想改造，好在政治思想上归附于工人阶级。旧知识分子的资产阶级的个人主义与社会主义的集体主义也是根本不相容的；旧知识分子的独占知识脱离体力劳动，也是同社会主义、共产主义的体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合的原则相矛盾的。因此，旧知识分子必须加紧政治理论的学习，尤其要精读毛主席的著作，深入体会党和政府的方针政策以及国内外时事问题。在工作岗位上通过业务实践和社会实践，经常进行两条道路，两种人生观，两种方法的斗争，经常以毛主席所说的六项标准来检查自己的思想，拔掉白旗，插上红旗。随时向党交心，有什么说什么，想什么讲什么，以便依靠党的领导与帮助，好加速改造思想。积极参加体力劳动，到工农群众中去，体验工人农民的思想感情，向工农群众学习，吸取那里无穷无尽的智慧，克服自己的主观、片面和损人利己的个人主义，逐步做到“知识分子劳动化”“劳动人民知识化”，逐步缩短脑力劳动与体力劳动的距离，从而促进知识与劳动的完全合一。显然，思想改造是复杂的、艰巨的、长期的而且是必要的。我个人过去抓得不紧，改得很慢，今后一定要纠正过来，利用我们的好晚景，回复我们的第二度青春。
    我们参加过辛亥革命的老同志，虽曾庆幸过推翻了我国几千年的封建专制政体，但无不痛心疾首辛亥革命的果实先后被北洋军阀以及蒋介石反动集团所窃据，置人民于水深火热之中达数十年之久。等到共产党和毛主席领导我们取得新民主主义革命的胜利，才实现了我国革命导师孙中山先生的理想，继承了中国革命的传统，并且运用用之四海而皆准的马列主义革命理论结合中国革命具体情况，继续进行社会主义革命，因而才有上述史无前例的成就。希望那些爱国而受愚的人们，及时清醒回头来。辛亥革命之所以终于失败，原因在于当时没有共产党的领导，新民主主义革命和社会主义革命之所以连续胜利，关键在于有了共产党的领导，这中间相隔半个世纪，牺牲了无数革命先烈的生命，好不容易才为我们人民找到了革命的方向及其带路人，因此，我们千万要珍惜和拥护党的领导，听毛主席的话，坚决一致走社会主义的道路。
