    Princess Wencheng

    The "People's Daily" articles on April 24th and 25th both mentioned the story of Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty marrying the Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo. The second page of the "People's Daily" on April 25th also published a statue of Princess Wencheng. Here is a brief introduction to the role Princess Wencheng played at that time and her impact on Tibet.

    Songtsen Gampo (translated in Chinese historical books as Qizong Longzan) was an outstanding Tibetan King in the seventh century. At that time, it was the era of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty in the early Tang Dynasty of China. He sent people to Chang'an, the capital of the Tang Dynasty, several times with heavy gifts to request marriage. As a result, the Tang Dynasty granted his request and married Princess Wencheng, a member of the imperial family, to him, and specially sent Li Daoxong, Minister of the Ministry of Rites, to escort her to Tibet. The Tibetan people respected the princess very much and called her the "Master of Illuminating Scriptures." The places she passed through are still considered sacred by the Tibetan people, such as Barkhor Street in Lhasa.

    After Princess Wencheng entered Tibet, she strengthened the friendly relations between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups. The Tibetan King became more respectful to the Tang Dynasty. When Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty returned victoriously from his expedition to Liaodong, the Tibetan King sent envoys to submit a letter of congratulations. When Emperor Taizong died, Emperor Gaozong ascended the throne and conferred on Songtsen Gampo the title of驸马都尉 (Imperial Son-in-Law Commandant) and the title of Prince of Xihai. He was very grateful and wrote to the ministers of the Tang Dynasty, saying, "When the emperor first ascends the throne, if there are any disloyal people, I am willing to lead troops to the country to jointly fight against them." He enthusiastically expressed his boundless loyalty to the Tang Dynasty. He also presented gold and prepared gifts to pay tribute to the tomb of Emperor Taizong. He also requested China to send agricultural and industrial technicians such as silkworm rearing, winemaking, pottery making, and rice milling to help him.

    Princess Wencheng brought many things to Tibet, including silk, daily utensils, medicines, and books. Among the books were many about production technology, such as "Sixty Methods of Crafts." Since then, Central Plains industry and agriculture and various skills have been gradually introduced into Tibet. Princess Wencheng also taught the Tibetans to implement the calendar, basically using the Chinese lunar calendar's twelve zodiac signs and the principle of a sixty-year cycle. She also taught them to formulate laws, called the "Ten Virtuous Laws," which stipulated "Ten Evil Deeds" and "Sixteen Essentials" of good deeds. The content was obviously a combination of Buddhist doctrines and Confucianism.

    Buddhism was not very popular in Tibet, but because the princess believed in Buddhism and brought Buddhist statues with her, it is said that the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa was built to enshrine the Buddhist statues, and this statue still exists today. Due to Princess Wencheng's belief in Buddhism, Songtsen Gampo was influenced by her and greatly promoted Buddhism, and since then Buddhism in Tibet has flourished more than before.

    Princess Wencheng died in 680 AD, having lived in Tibet for about forty years. Because of her great contributions to Tibet, the Tibetan people respected her very much and specially stipulated two festivals to commemorate her. Tibetan history records her deeds in large amounts of space, and Tibetan dramas perform her story, almost regarding her as a fairy.

    Of course, the introduction of Central Plains culture into Tibet cannot be entirely attributed to her alone. For example, the craftsmen who accompanied her to Tibet, as well as the Tibetan youths who studied in the mainland, made great contributions to the exchange of Han and Tibetan cultures, but she was, after all, one of the earliest advocates.

    In the Potala Palace in Tibet, there are still statues of Songtsen Gampo and Princess Wencheng, and the palace also preserves the remains of their wedding cave. (Domestic Information Group of this newspaper)

    文成公主
    4月24、25两天的“人民日报”七版的文章里，都提到了唐朝文成公主与藏王松赞干布结婚的故事，25日“人民日报”的第二版还登了文成公主的塑像。这里简单地介绍一下文成公主在当时所起的作用和对西藏的影响。
    松赞干布（中国史书译为弃宗弄赞）是公元七世纪杰出的藏王，那时正是中国唐朝初年唐太宗时代，他几次派人带着厚重的礼物到唐朝的首都西安来，请求通婚，结果唐朝允许了他的请求，把宗室的女儿文成公主嫁给他，并特派礼部尚书李道宗护送入藏。西藏人非常尊敬公主，称她为“通明经卷之主”。她经过的地方，藏族人民至今还认为是圣洁之所，如拉萨的八角大街。
    文成公主入藏后，加强了汉藏两族的友好关系，藏王对唐朝更为恭顺，当唐太宗征辽凯旋，藏王派使来上书庆贺。唐太宗死了，高宗即位，封松赞干布为驸马都尉，又封为西海郡王，他非常感激，致书于唐朝的大臣说：“天子初即位，有不忠者，愿勒兵赴国共讨之。”热烈表示对唐朝的无限忠诚。并献金备礼向唐太宗的陵墓致祭。又请求中国派遣如养蚕、酿酒、制陶、碾米等工农业技术人员去帮助他。
    文成公主到西藏，带去了很多东西，其中有绸缎、日用器物、药物、书籍。书籍中有许多是关于生产技术的，如“工艺六十法”等。自此中原工农两业及各种技艺，均次第传入西藏。文成公主还教藏人推行历数，基本上用中国旧历的十二属相及六十年一循环之理。又教之制定法律，称为“十善法律”，规定为“恶行十则”和善行“十六要”，内容显然是佛教教义及儒家学说的综合。
    佛教在西藏本不很盛行，因为公主信佛教，带了佛像去，相传拉萨的大昭寺就是为了供奉佛像而建筑的，现在这尊佛像还存在。由于文成公主的信佛，松赞干布受了她的影响，大大提倡佛教，从此西藏的佛教比以前大盛。
    文成公主死于680年，在西藏生活了约四十年，由于她对西藏有很大的贡献，藏族人民对她非常尊敬，特规定了两个节日来纪念她。西藏的历史用大量的篇幅记载她的事迹，西藏的戏剧演出她的故事，几乎把她看作仙人。
    当然，中原文化传入西藏，不能完全归功于她一个人，例如随她入藏的工匠，以及到内地学习的藏族青年，对于汉藏文化的交流，都有极大的贡献，但是她究竟是一个最早的提倡者。
    现在西藏的布达拉宫，还有松赞干布和文成公主的塑像，宫内还保存着他们结婚的洞房遗迹。　　　（本报国内资料组）
