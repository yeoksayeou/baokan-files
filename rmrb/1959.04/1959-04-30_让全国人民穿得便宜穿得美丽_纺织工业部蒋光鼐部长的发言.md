Comrades:

I fully agree with and support the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

In 1958, while greatly increasing production, product quality was improved, accumulating a lot of experience for further increasing variety and improving quality in the future.

1958 was a year of comprehensive great leap forward in China's socialist construction. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the textile industry, in accordance with the direction indicated by the Party's general line for socialist construction, launched a vigorous mass movement, giving full play to the soaring revolutionary drive of the broad masses of workers, and achieved tremendous achievements in developing production and meeting social needs.

In 1958, 6.1 million bales of cotton yarn were produced, an increase of 31 percent over 1957; 5.7 billion meters of cotton cloth, an increase of 13 percent over 1957; 26.28 million meters of woolen fabrics, an increase of 45 percent over 1957; 115 million hemp sacks, an increase of 36 percent over 1957; and 194.84 million meters of silk fabrics, an increase of 35 percent over 1957. Various textile products greatly exceeded the average annual growth rate of the First Five-Year Plan. Taking cotton yarn as an example, it was equivalent to six times the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan. The main reason for the rapid growth of various textile products was the full utilization of the production potential of existing textile enterprises. For example, the unit output of 21-count cotton yarn increased from an average of 25 kilograms per thousand spindles per hour nationwide in 1957 to 30 kilograms, an increase of 20 percent.

While vigorously increasing production, product quality was further improved, and more than 5,000 new designs and varieties were trial-produced. Various places produced many durable and popular products, such as 16-count and 18-count warp and weft cotton cloth, floral serge, etc.; at the same time, the color fastness of printed and dyed products was improved, and the shrinkage rate of various fabrics was reduced, which was welcomed by the broad masses of working people in rural areas. In addition, high-end products such as 200-count poplin, embossed overcoats, and Dongfeng silk were trial-produced and produced, accumulating a lot of experience for further increasing designs and varieties and improving quality.

Basic construction and textile machinery production have also developed greatly. The annual production of cotton spinning machines was 1 million spindles, an increase of more than 100 percent over 1957, equivalent to 46 percent of the total production during the First Five-Year Plan. The scale of cotton spinning basic construction was 1 million spindles, equivalent to 40 percent of the First Five-Year Plan. The new construction projects are distributed in 27 provinces (municipalities) and autonomous regions, which has changed the unreasonable layout left over from history and formed a new situation in which the textile industry is blooming everywhere.

The great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in the textile industry in 1958 fully prove that the Party's general line for socialist construction and the set of "walking on two legs" policies are correct. Due to the implementation of the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, in 1958, the output of steel and grain and cotton in China doubled, which greatly encouraged and promoted the Great Leap Forward in the textile industry.

On the basis of the great victory achieved in the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, textile enterprises in various places universally adopted the method of vigorously launching mass movements, implemented measures such as "two participations," "one reform," and "three combinations," and closely linked the relationship between leaders and the masses, improved the communist consciousness of the broad masses of workers, gave full play to the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, improved equipment, improved technology, improved operations, manufactured equipment themselves, manufactured materials themselves, and ran their own power plants, etc., giving full play to the spirit of combining hard work, practical work, and skillful work. For example, textile factories in Liaoning Province once encountered difficulties due to insufficient power supply in September and October last year. However, the broad masses of workers tried their best to overcome the difficulties actively. They not only used all the power equipment that could be used, such as steam engines and diesel engines, but also used tides, biogas, and wind power to generate electricity, reducing downtime.

In order to further meet the needs of the people's lives, the textile industry will have an even greater leap forward this year.

The rapid leap forward of China's textile industry also powerfully proves the superiority of the socialist system and the Party's deep concern for the people's lives. In 1958, the average per capita consumption of cotton cloth in the country increased by 10 percent compared with 1957, which is in stark contrast to the decline in textile production, unemployment of workers, and reduced purchasing power of the people in capitalist countries. The imperialists slander China's Great Leap Forward, saying that we have sacrificed the people's living welfare. The fact that China's textile industry has made a great leap forward and the people's clothing consumption level has improved alone exposes their utter shameless lies.

Although China's textile industry has already made a tremendous leap forward, it still cannot meet the rapidly growing needs of society. China is a large country with a population of more than 600 million and the people are the masters of their own affairs. The number of textiles needed across the country is very large. After the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and the realization of people's communes in rural areas, the demand for textiles has increased even more due to the increase in people's purchasing power. The demand for textiles from other sectors of the national economy is also increasing rapidly. For example, the amount of cloth used for industrial production and tire cord fabric used by the rubber industry in 1959 will increase by more than 50 percent compared with 1958. This requires the textile industry to accelerate its development in order to produce more textiles to meet the needs of the people's clothing and national construction.

Based on the above situation, the textile industry plans to produce 8.5 million bales of cotton yarn in 1959, an increase of 39 percent over 1958; 7.2 billion meters of cotton cloth, an increase of 26 percent over 1958; and various other textiles will also have considerable increases. Textile equipment will increase even more. It is planned to produce 2.5 million cotton spinning spindles this year, an increase of 150 percent over 1958, equivalent to half of the total number of cotton spinning spindles in old China, and 20 percent more than the increase during China's First Five-Year Plan. After these equipments are put into production, China's cotton spinning spindles can be increased from the existing 8.3 million spindles to more than 10 million spindles. From these indicators, it can be seen that the textile industry will have an even greater leap forward this year on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward.

Improving product quality and increasing designs and varieties are the central links of current textile production.

Our proposal to focus on improving product quality and increasing designs and varieties as the central links of current production is based on the actual situation. The fundamental task of the textile industry is to produce more cheap and good-quality textiles to meet the needs of the people. If the quality is not good, it is a waste for the entire society. At the same time, the cotton currently has more impurities, and the quality of raw wool is also relatively poor. The second and third quarters are also seasons of mold and high temperatures, which requires us to pay more attention to improving product quality. Of course, vigorously improving product quality does not mean that other aspects can be ignored. After last year's Great Leap Forward, the production level of textile enterprises has been greatly improved, but in terms of production efficiency, there is still an imbalance between enterprises. There are still unreasonable phenomena in the use of labor and the consumption of raw materials; therefore, we need to make double efforts to do a good job in machine maintenance and repair, improve technology, and improve workers' operating skills in order to achieve high output, high quality, and improved labor productivity.

In order to ensure the completion of textile production tasks, the production tasks of textile machinery must be completed on time, with guaranteed quality, and in sufficient quantity.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's textile production tasks and the needs of future development, the production tasks of this year's textile machinery must be completed on time, with guaranteed quality, and in sufficient quantity to ensure that new factories can be put into production as early as possible. Since liberation, China's textile machinery manufacturing industry has experienced a process of development from nothing to something, from small to large. At present, it has a certain scale, and the textile machines produced have reached an advanced level. As long as we continue to give full play to the potential of existing textile machinery factories and carry out necessary expansions, we can further increase the production capacity of textile machinery. At the same time, we must strengthen cooperation and expand the scope of national supporting facilities in accordance with the spirit of the whole country as a chessboard. According to the equipment capacity and specific conditions of each textile machinery factory, some factories should produce more main machines, and some factories should produce more auxiliary machines, in order to give full play to the characteristics of each machinery factory. Since all kinds of equipment are complete sets nationwide, and each link is closely connected, if one place, one factory, or one kind of machine fails to complete the task, it will affect the overall situation. We must make great efforts to do this work well in order to complete this year's textile machinery production tasks with more, faster, better, and more economical results.

In order to complete this year's tasks, we must continue to vigorously launch mass movements and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. Since the beginning of this year, textile enterprises in various places, on the basis of summarizing the achievements and experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, have launched a vigorous red flag competition with the goal of high output and high quality, and vigorously carried out the movement of skilled workers and the "skillful girls" movement, which has further improved product quality, production efficiency, and labor productivity. We should, under the leadership of the Party, further rely on and mobilize the masses, strengthen enterprise management, and establish and improve necessary rules and regulations, so that the movement can develop better, more deeply, and more persistently.

This year is the tenth anniversary of the founding of our new China. Over the past ten years, the textile industry has experienced a glorious development process. China has changed from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country that imported cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and textile machinery into a people's China that is completely independent and self-reliant in the textile industry. We believe that with the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with the Party's general line for socialist construction, and with the high enthusiasm and endless creativity of textile workers across the country, China's textile industry will surely continue to leap forward and achieve even more brilliant achievements.

Tibet will always be China's Tibet. To separate Tibet from China is as futile as dreaming of moving the Himalayas. It is a waste of effort.

Comrades! In the era of our country's socialist construction undertaking galloping and advancing by leaps and bounds, it will inevitably enhance the belief of the people of the world in the superiority of socialism and deepen people's doubts about the capitalist system. The international and domestic situation is extremely favorable to us. As Chairman Mao said, the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. We will continue to move forward along the road of victory. However, the enemy is not reconciled to our victory, and they will try everything possible to carry out evil activities of conspiracy and sabotage. Recently, the original Tibetan local government and a small handful of reactionary elements of the upper class, under the instigation of imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, regardless of the interests of the 1.2 million people of Tibet, regardless of the unity and unification of the motherland, launched an armed rebellion and kidnapped the Dalai Lama to India, attempting to separate Tibet from the motherland, maintain the most backward, darkest, and most cruel serf system, and become a foreign colony and protectorate. Therefore, our Central People's Government has taken resolute measures to quickly quell the rebellion. The quelling of the Tibetan rebellion has promoted the rebirth of Tibet and further consolidated the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. I resolutely support the State Council's order to dissolve the original Tibetan local government and have the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercise its functions and powers, and support the government's wise measures to completely quell the rebellion.

It is not surprising that the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are doing their utmost to support the Tibetan rebellion and using it to maliciously slander our country. It is regrettable that India's expansionists have ignored the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China and India and used the Tibetan rebellion to stir up trouble, attempting to separate Tibet from our country. Their wishful thinking is wrong. Tibet will always be China's Tibet and will never allow any foreigners to interfere. To separate Tibet from our country is as futile as dreaming of moving the Himalayas! We hope that India's expansionists will not inherit the mantle of British imperialist aggressors. The Chinese people who have stood up will never allow any foreign countries to interfere in our country's internal affairs. The unity and unification of our great motherland cannot be destroyed by anyone. The people of our country will unite more closely around the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and will surely be able to defeat any conspiracy to split the motherland and sow discord among the unity of all ethnic groups in our country, and will surely be able to build a great socialist country where all ethnic groups in the country are jointly prosperous.

### 让全国人民穿得便宜穿得美丽  纺织工业部蒋光鼐部长的发言

专栏：

    让全国人民穿得便宜穿得美丽
    纺织工业部蒋光鼐部长的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    一九五八年，在大大增加生产的同时，提高了产品质量，为今后进一步增加品种、提高质量积累了很多经验
    一九五八年，是我国社会主义建设全面大跃进的一年。纺织工业在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，遵照党的社会主义建设总路线所指示的方向，开展了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，发挥了广大职工的冲天革命干劲，在发展生产和满足社会需要方面，取得了巨大的成就。
    一九五八年生产了棉纱六百一十万件，比一九五七年增加百分之三十一；棉布五十七亿公尺，比一九五七年增加百分之十三；毛织品二千六百二十八万公尺，比一九五七年增加百分之四十五；麻袋一亿一千五百万条，比一九五七年增加百分之三十六；丝织品一亿九千四百八十四万公尺，比一九五七年增加百分之三十五。各种纺织产品都大大超过了第一个五年计划的平均每年增长速度。以棉纱来说，就相当于第一个五年计划期间每年平均增长速度的六倍。各种纺织品迅速增长的主要原因，是发挥了现有纺织企业的生产潜力。如二十一支棉纱的单位产量，由一九五七年全国平均千锭时二十五公斤，增加到三十公斤，提高了百分之二十。
    在大力增加生产的同时，进一步提高了产品质量，试制了五千多种新的花色品种。各地生产了许多坚牢耐穿的大众化产品，如十六支和十八支经纬纱棉布、花哔叽等；同时也提高了印染品的染色牢度，降低了各种织物的缩水率，受到了农村广大劳动人民的欢迎。此外，还试制和生产了二百支以上的府绸、拷花大衣呢、东风绸等高级产品，为进一步增加花色品种、提高质量，积累了很多的经验。
    基本建设和纺织机械生产也有了很大的发展，全年生产了棉纺机一百万锭，比一九五七年增长一倍以上，等于第一个五年计划生产总数的百分之四十六。棉纺织基本建设规模为一百万锭，等于第一个五年计划的百分之四十。新的建设项目分布在二十七个省（市）和自治区，这就改变了历史遗留下来的不合理的布局，形成了纺织工业遍地开花的新局面。
    一九五八年纺织工业大跃进的巨大成就，充分证明了党的社会主义建设总路线的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针是正确的。由于贯彻执行了在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工业与农业同时并举、重工业与轻工业同时并举的方针，一九五八年，我国的钢铁和粮棉的产量都翻了一番，这对纺织工业的大跃进起了极大的鼓舞与促进作用。
    在整风运动和反右派斗争取得了伟大胜利的基础上，各地纺织企业普遍采用了大搞群众运动的方法，实行了“两参”“一改”“三结合”等措施，密切了领导和群众的关系，提高了广大职工的共产主义觉悟，发挥了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，大搞技术革新、技术革命，改进设备，改进工艺，改进操作，自制设备，自制器材，自办电力等，充分发挥了苦干、实干、巧干相结合的精神。例如辽宁省各纺织厂在去年九、十两月，曾一度遇到电力供应不足的困难，但是，广大职工想尽了一切办法，积极克服困难，他们不仅利用了一切可以利用的动力设备，如蒸汽机、柴油机等，而且还利用潮汐、沼气、风力等来发电，减少了停工时间。
      为了进一步满足人民生活
  的需要，今年纺织工业还要有
  一个更大的跃进
    我国纺织工业以这样快的速度向前跃进；也有力地证明了社会主义制度的优越性和党对人民生活的深切关怀。一九五八年全国平均每人棉布消费量比一九五七年增长百分之十，它与资本主义国家的纺织生产下降、工人失业、人民购买力降低，形成了鲜明的对比。帝国主义者污蔑我国大跃进，说我们牺牲了人民的生活福利，仅就我国纺织工业大跃进和人民衣着消费水平的提高的事实，就戳穿了他们所说的是彻头彻尾的无耻谰言。
    我国纺织工业虽然已经有了巨大的跃进，但是，仍然不能适应社会迅速增长的需要。我国是一个拥有六亿多人口、人民当家作主的大国，全国需要纺织品的数量是很大的，在工农业大跃进和农村实现人民公社化以后，由于人民购买力的提高，对纺织品的需要量就更多。国民经济其他部门对纺织品的需要也增加很快，如一九五九年工业生产用布和橡胶工业用的帘子布，都将比一九五八年增加百分之五十以上。这就要求纺织工业必须加快发展，以生产更多的纺织品来满足人民衣着需要和国家建设需要。
    根据上述情况，一九五九年纺织工业计划生产棉纱八百五十万件，比一九五八年增加百分之三十九；棉布七十二亿公尺，比一九五八年增加百分之二十六；其他各种纺织品也都有相当的增加。纺织设备增加更多。今年计划生产棉纺机二百五十万锭，比一九五八年增加百分之一百五十，等于旧中国棉纺锭总数的一半，比我国第一个五年计划期间增加的还要多百分之二十。这些设备投入生产以后，我国的棉纺锭就可以由现有的八百三十万锭增加到一千万锭以上。从这些指标可以看出，今年纺织工业在去年大跃进的基础上将要有一个更大的跃进。
      提高产品质量，增加花色
  品种，是当前纺织生产的中心
  环节
    一九五九年纺织工业的任务是艰巨的，全国纺织职工必须在党的领导下，沿着一九五八年大跃进的胜利道路，继续英勇奋斗，开展一个高产高质和提高劳动生产率的增产节约运动，在当前，更应抓住提高产品质量、增加花色品种这一中心环节，以更好地全面地完成和超额完成今年的任务。
    我们提出以提高产品质量、增加花色品种为当前生产的中心环节，是从目前实际情况出发的。纺织工业的根本任务是生产更多的价廉物美的纺织品，来满足人民需要。如果质量不好，从整个社会来说是一个浪费。同时，目前棉花的杂质比较多，原毛的质量也比较差，第二、三季度又是黄霉和高温季节，这就需要我们更加注意提高产品质量。当然，大力提高产品质量并不是说可以忽视其他方面。经过去年大跃进，纺织企业的生产水平已有很大的提高，但在生产效率方面，企业与企业之间还是不平衡的，在劳动力的使用和原料、材料的消耗方面还有不合理的现象；因此，就需要我们加倍努力，做好机器维护检修工作，改进技术，提高工人操作水平，以达到高产高质和提高劳动生产率的目的。
      为保证纺织生产任务的完
  成，必须按时、按质、按量完
  成纺织机械的生产任务
    为了保证今年纺织生产任务的完成和今后发展的需要，必须按时、按质、按量地完成今年纺织机械的生产任务，以保证新厂及早地投入生产。解放以来我国纺织机械制造工业经历了从无到有，从小到大的发展过程，目前已具有一定的规模，生产的纺织机器已经达到了先进水平。只要我们继续发挥原有纺织机械厂的潜力，并进行必要的扩建，就可以进一步增加纺织机械的生产能力。同时，要根据全国一盘棋的精神，加强协作，扩大全国配套范围。根据各个纺织机械厂的设备能力和具体条件，有的多生产主要机器，有的多生产附属机器，以发挥各个机械厂的特长。由于各种设备都是全国成套，各个环节扣得很紧，一个地方、一个工厂、一种机器完不成任务，就要影响全局，我们必须作很大的努力做好这一工作，以多快好省地完成今年的纺织机械生产任务。
    为了完成今年任务，我们必须继续大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新、技术革命。今年以来，各地纺织企业在总结去年大跃进的成就和经验的基础上，掀起了轰轰烈烈的以高产、高质为目标的红旗竞赛，大搞能手运动和“巧姑娘”运动，使产品质量、生产效率和劳动生产率等有了进一步提高。我们应该在党的领导下，进一步依靠和发动群众、加强企业管理、建立与健全必要的规章制度，使运动更好更深入更持久地向前发展。
    今年是我们新中国建国十周年。十年来，纺织工业已经经历了一段光辉的发展过程。我国已经从一个进口棉花、棉纱、棉布和纺织机械的半殖民地半封建的国家，变成为一个在纺织工业上完全能够独立自主的人民中国了。我们相信，有党中央和毛主席的英明领导，有党的社会主义建设总路线，有全国纺织职工的高度积极性和无穷无尽的创造性，我国纺织工业一定能够继续跃进，一定能够取得更光辉的成就。
      西藏永远是中国的西藏，
  要把西藏从中国分裂出去，犹
  如妄想搬掉喜马拉雅山一样，
  是枉费心机
    各位代表！在我国社会主义建设事业万马奔腾、突飞猛进的时代，必然会增强全世界人民对于社会主义优越性的信念，加深人们对于资本主义制度的怀疑，国际国内形势对我们都极其有利。正如毛主席说过的，敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。我们将沿着胜利的道路继续向前迈进。但是，敌人是不甘心我们的胜利的，它们会想尽一切办法来进行阴谋破坏的罪恶活动。最近，原西藏地方政府和上层一小撮反动分子在帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派的指使下，不顾西藏一百二十万人民的利益，不顾祖国的团结和统一，发动了武装叛乱，并将达赖喇嘛劫往印度，企图使西藏脱离祖国，保持最落后、最黑暗、最残酷的农奴制度，成为外国的殖民地和保护国。因此，我中央人民政府采取了坚决的措施，迅速的平息了叛乱。西藏叛乱的平息，促进了西藏的新生，进一步巩固了全国各族人民大团结。我坚决拥护国务院解散原西藏地方政府、由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使其职权的命令，拥护政府彻底平息叛乱的英明措施。
    帝国主义者和蒋介石匪帮极力支持西藏叛乱，并利用它来恶毒地诽谤我国，是不足为奇的。令人遗憾的是印度的扩张主义分子竟无视中印两国倡议的和平共处的五项原则，利用西藏叛乱兴风作浪，企图把西藏从我国分裂出去，他们的如意算盘打错了。西藏永远是中国的西藏，永远不许任何外国人干涉，要把西藏从我国分裂出去，犹如妄想搬掉喜马拉雅山一样，这是枉费心机！我们希望印度的扩张主义分子不要继承英帝国主义侵略者的衣钵。站起来了的中国人民决不容许任何外国来干涉我国的内政。我们伟大祖国的团结和统一，是任何人也破坏不了的。我国人民将更加紧密的团结在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的周围，一定能击破任何分裂祖国和离间我国各民族团结的阴谋，一定能够建设一个全国各民族共同繁荣昌盛的伟大的社会主义国家。
