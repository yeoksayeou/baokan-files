Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 11th: TASS issued a statement today refuting rumors that the Soviet Union was sending armed Kurdish youths to Iraq.

The statement said that recently, the Associated Press, United Press International, and Agence France-Presse, citing news from Port Said, reported that 855 "armed Soviet Kurdish youths, well-trained in guerrilla warfare," were en route to Iraq. These reports have been particularly widely used by newspapers in the United Arab Republic, which have taken the opportunity to make various speculations about the Soviet Union.

TASS is authorized to declare that the above reports are complete fabrications.

The statement said that the fact is that 459 Iraqi Kurdish citizens sailed from Odessa to Basra (Iraq) in early April on the Soviet ship "Georgia." These citizens had fled from Iraq to the Soviet Union for refuge in 1947 because they were persecuted by the reactionary colonialist regime of Nuri al-Said-Faisal for participating in the Iraqi People's National Liberation Movement. Accompanying them were their families—wives and children, totaling 394 people.

The statement said that these Kurds had lived in various regions of the Soviet Union, and after the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, they expressed their willingness to return to their homeland. The Iraqi government also expressed its willingness to receive them, and they will be repatriated to Iraq with their families with the assistance of the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Among the Iraqi Kurds being repatriated are about 100 elderly and disabled men.

The statement pointed out that these facts are well known to those who spread the above rumors. Those who masquerade as protectors of the interests of the Arabs have taken such vile measures against this humanitarian action. For these people, the matter is obviously not pleasant.

　　塔斯社发表声明
    驳斥所谓苏联派库尔德族人去伊拉克的谣言
    新华社莫斯科11日电　塔斯社今天发表声明，驳斥关于苏联派遣武装的库尔德族青年去伊拉克的谣言。
    声明说，近来，美联社和合众国际社、法新社援引从塞得港得到的消息说，有八百五十五名“受过进行游击战争良好训练的、武装的苏联库尔德族青年”正在去伊拉克的途中。这些消息特别广泛地被阿拉伯联合共和国的报纸所采用，并借此机会对苏联进行种种猜测。
    塔斯社受权发表声明，上述消息完全是捏造的。
    声明说，事实是，有四百五十九名伊拉克库尔德族公民于4月初乘苏联的“格鲁吉亚号”轮船从敖德萨去巴士拉（伊拉克）。这些公民是因为参加伊拉克人民民族解放运动而遭到努里·赛义德—费萨尔反动殖民主义政权的迫害，于1947年从伊拉克逃到苏联避难的。与他们同行的有他们的家属——妻子和子女共三百九十四人。
    声明说，这些库尔德族人曾经居住在苏联的各个地区，他们在伊拉克共和国宣告成立后，表示愿意返回祖国。伊拉克政府也表示愿意接纳他们，他们将同他们的家属一起在苏联红十字会和红新月会的协助下遣送回伊拉克。在遣送回国的伊拉克库尔德人中约有一百名男性老年人和残废者。
    声明指出，这些事实是散布上述谣言的人所十分清楚的。那些把自己装扮成阿拉伯人的利益的保护者竟对这一人道主义措施采取如此下流的手段。对这些人来说，事情显然是不美妙的。
