    Golden Urn
  　Gesang

    On the upper floor of the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, there is enshrined a golden urn ( "Urn" is the Tibetan word for bottle). This golden urn was bestowed by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. It is not only exquisite and precious, but also possesses great authority, because in the Manchu Qing Dynasty it was used to determine the candidates for the new "reincarnated" Dalai Lama, Panchen Erdeni, and all the larger Hutuktu (Mongolian title for living Buddha) of Tibet.

    This golden urn was issued by the Qianlong Emperor in 1792 (the 57th year of Qianlong) based on the report from Fukang'an, the then-Resident Minister in Tibet. Qianlong also sent someone to Tibet with it. When the imperially bestowed golden urn was sent to Lhasa, Resident Minister Fukang'an, the Dalai Lama, and monastic and secular officials held a grand welcoming ceremony, and then enshrined it on the upper floor of the Jokhang Temple in the center of Lhasa.

  In Tibet, the Dalai Lama, Panchen Erdeni, and those Hutuktus are all called Living Buddhas, and it is believed that they can be "reincarnated" after their passing. But where exactly are they born? When are they reincarnated? This is a major issue. Generally, it is designated by a respected Living Buddha or "Chuizhong" (similar to a wizard) who performs divination at the time and place. However, it often happens that several people are simultaneously pointed out, making it difficult to distinguish between the real and the false, causing confusion, and even leading to disputes and significant conflicts. For example, two Sixth Dalai Lamas appeared, causing disputes. At that time, Resident Minister Fukang'an reported to Qianlong, requesting the issuance of a golden urn, ordering that the names and dates of birth of the reincarnated Living Buddhas pointed out by the four Chuizhong be written on separate slips, stored in the urn, and determined by drawing lots in front of everyone. (See "Weizang Tongzhi"). From the establishment of the golden urn system, the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, as well as the great Hutuktus of the front and rear Tibet, must be determined by drawing lots from the golden urn. It was also stipulated that the slips should be written in Manchu, Chinese, and Tibetan, specifying the names and dates of birth of the reincarnated Living Buddhas pointed out by each "Chuizhong," and placed in the urn. Lamas familiar with the scriptures were selected to recite scriptures piously for seven days, and all the Hutuktus were notified to gather in front of the Buddha in the Jokhang Temple, where the Resident Minister personally supervised and drew lots in public to determine the reincarnation. Similarly, a golden urn was also set up in the Yonghe Temple in Beijing, which was used to determine the reincarnation of Living Buddhas from Mongolia through lot drawing.

    The story of the golden urn illustrates that the political and religious systems of Tibet, like those of Mongolia and other fraternal ethnic groups, were gradually established by the central government in Beijing.

    金本巴瓶
  　格桑
    拉萨大昭寺的楼上供奉着一个金本巴瓶（“本巴”就是藏语瓶子的意思）。这个金本巴瓶是清朝乾隆皇帝御赐的，它不仅精致名贵，而且具有极大的权威，因为它在满清时代就是用来决定新“转世”的达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和西藏所有较大的呼图克图（蒙语活佛封号）的呼毕勒罕（蒙古语转世活佛）的人选的。
    这个金瓶是1792年（乾隆57年）乾隆皇帝根据当时驻藏大臣福康安的禀奏颁发的，乾隆并派人送到西藏。当御赐的金本巴瓶送到拉萨时，驻藏大臣福康安和达赖以及僧俗官员举行了隆重的迎接仪式，然后把它供奉在拉萨市中心大昭寺楼上。
  西藏对达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和那些呼图克图都称为活佛，认为他们圆寂以后可以“转生”。但是究竟生在哪里？何时转生？却是一个大问题。一般凭当时当地有声望的活佛或者“吹忠”（类似巫师）降神作法指定。但往往各指一人同时出现几个，真假难分，无所适从，甚至发生争执，引起重大纠纷。例如第六世达赖喇嘛就出现两个，引起争执。当时驻藏大臣福康安禀奏乾隆要求颁发金本巴瓶一件，令将吹忠四人所指之呼毕勒罕姓名生年月日，各写一签贮瓶内，对众拈定。（见卫藏通志）。从那时建立金本巴瓶制度起，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼以及前后藏的大呼图克图的呼毕勒罕转生时，必须经过金本巴瓶抽签决定。并且规定签上用满汉藏三种文字写明各“吹忠”所指的呼毕勒罕的姓名生年月日等装在瓶内，拣选熟悉经典的喇嘛，虔诚诵经七日，并且传知各呼图克图等齐集在大昭寺佛前，由驻藏大臣亲往监督，当众抽签拈定。同样在北京的雍和宫里也设有一个金本巴瓶，这是为蒙古地方所出的呼毕勒罕来用抽签认定的。
    金本巴瓶的故事，说明了西藏的政治制度和宗教制度也和蒙古及其他兄弟民族一样，都是由北京的中央政府陆续规定的。
