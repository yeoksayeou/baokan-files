Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: The work of signing production and sales contracts between the state and the people's communes in a guided and planned manner is gradually unfolding nationwide. In areas where contracts have been signed, incorporating the production and sales activities of the people's communes into the national plan through contracts has already played a positive role in promoting the diversified operations of the communes.

Since the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed the widespread implementation of a contract system between the state and the people's communes, and between communes, various regions have attached importance to the signing of production and sales contracts. When carrying out diversified operations last winter, many regions had already tentatively implemented the contract system. After the agricultural and commercial departments of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions signed the 1959 annual production and sales agreement for major agricultural and sideline products in Beijing in January, this work was carried out level by level from the central government to the provinces, special districts, counties, and even the people's communes and production teams. Over the past two months, most provinces and autonomous regions have convened meetings attended by party committee secretaries, heads of finance and trade departments, and directors of agriculture and commerce bureaus at the prefectural and county levels to discuss the issue of promoting the contract system. More than ten provinces, including Hebei, Hunan, Shandong, and Fujian, organized agricultural departments in special districts or counties (cities) to sign production and sales agreements for major agricultural and sideline products with commercial departments at the meetings. The variety of commodities included in the contracts is also very complete, with most regions listing dozens, hundreds, or even three to five hundred commodities, including grain, oil crops, cash crops, livestock products, local specialties, Chinese medicinal materials, and handicraft products. After special districts and counties signed contracts between agricultural and commercial departments, many regions immediately signed contracts level by level down to the people's communes and production teams. After the commercial department of Liaocheng Special District in Shandong Province signed contracts with various production brigades, many commune members clearly understood what the state needed and what they should produce, and expressed their determination to complete the production tasks in accordance with the national plan. Of the more than 1,600 contracts signed in the entire district, more than 370 have already been fully implemented.

After signing production and sales contracts, many regions have effectively promoted the development of diversified economies and commodity production in the people's communes, closely linking the production and sales plans of the communes and production teams with the national plan. At the same time, the income of the communes and production teams has also begun to increase significantly. After the commercial department of Jian'ou County, Fujian Province, signed contracts with sixteen people's communes, the variety of products arranged by the communes increased by 122 items compared with the past, and the output value increased by more than 80% compared with the original production plan. Some of these were newly developed varieties based on national needs that had never been produced before, such as vinegar stone, soil nitrate, camphor oil, white fungus, and nanmu oil. Some were varieties that had been discontinued in the past but have now resumed production, such as persimmon oil, soil baskets, and bamboo hats. There were also some products that were originally self-sufficient, such as straw sandals, carrying poles, and bricks and tiles, which are now arranged for some production in addition to self-sufficiency, for sale as commodities. After signing contracts, the enthusiasm of many commune members for developing diversified operations has greatly increased. They said, "In the past, production was unplanned, and production was carried out after finding a good market. Now that there are production and sales contracts, we can focus on production and work harder." In Dahuangpu, Wuqing County, Hebei Province, paper reeds (paper making raw material) and fish are produced. In the past, the people's communes did not fully utilize these resources. After the commercial department signed a contract with them to purchase 10 million catties of paper reeds and 400,000 catties of fish, the commune members were very enthusiastic about production and completed the tasks stipulated in the contract in less than seven days, increasing the commune's income by more than 360,000 yuan.

　　把公社生产队产销活动纳入国家计划
　　各地广泛签订产销合同
　　公社社员知道了国家需要，大大提高多种经营的积极性
    新华社11日讯　国家和人民公社之间有领导、有计划地签订产销合同的工作，目前正在全国范围内逐渐展开。在签订了合同的地区，由于通过合同把人民公社的生产和销售活动纳入了国家计划，对于促进公社发展多种经营，已经起了良好的作用。
    党的八届六中全会提出要在国家和人民公社之间、公社和公社之间广泛地实行合同制度以来，各地对于签订产销合同引起了重视。在去年冬季开展多种经营时，不少地区已经初步推行了合同制度。今年
  1月各省、市、自治区的农业部门和商业部门在北京签订了1959年度主要农副产品的产销协议书以后，这一工作就从中央到省、专区、县以至人民公社、生产队逐级开展起来。两个多月来，大部分省和自治区都召开了有地、县两级党委书记、财贸部长、农业和商业局长参加的会议，讨论了推行合同制度的问题。河北、湖南、山东、福建等十多个省都在会上组织专区或县（市）的农业部门同商业部门签订了主要农副产品的产销协议书。订入合同的商品品种也很齐全，多数地区列入了几十种，一、二百种，甚至三、五百种商品，这里面包括粮食、油料、经济作物、畜产品、土特产品、中药材和手工业产品等。专区、县农商部门之间签订合同以后，不少地区立即层层向下签订，一直落实到人民公社和生产队。山东省聊城专区商业部门同各生产大队签订了合同以后，许多社员都明确了国家需要什么和自己应该生产什么，表示一定要按照国家计划完成生产任务；全专区签订的一千六百多份合同中，目前已经有三百七十多份完全实现。
    许多地区签订产销合同后，有力地促进了人民公社多种经济和商品生产的发展，使公社、生产队的生产、销售计划与国家的计划紧密地衔接起来，同时公社和生产队的收入也开始大大地增加。福建省建瓯县商业部门同十六个人民公社签订合同以后，公社安排的生产品种比过去增加了一百二十二项，产值比原订生产计划增加了80％多，其中有些是过去从来没有生产过、根据国家需要新开辟的品种，如醋石、土硝、樟脑油、白木耳、楠木油等；有些是过去中断现在恢复生产的品种；如柿油、土箕、斗笠等，还有一些原来自给的产品，如草鞋、扁担、砖瓦等，现在除自给外还安排了一部分生产，作为商品出售。许多公社社员在签订合同后对于发展多种经营的积极性大为高涨。他们说，“过去生产无计划，找好销路再生产，如今产销有合同，安心生产加油干”。河北省武清县大黄铺，出产纸苇（造纸原料）和鱼，过去人民公社没有充分利用这些资源，商业部门和他们签订了收购一千万斤纸苇、四十万斤鱼的合同以后，社员们生产热情很高，不到七天就完成了合同规定的任务，使公社增加收入三十六万多元。
