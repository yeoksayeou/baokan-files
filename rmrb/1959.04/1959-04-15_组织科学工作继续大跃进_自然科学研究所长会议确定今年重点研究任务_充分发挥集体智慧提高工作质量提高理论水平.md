Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The Chinese Academy of Sciences held a conference of natural science institute directors in Beijing from the 7th to the 13th. Following the principle of rationally using resources and serving the "Four Major Indicators," the conference organized scientific work to continue the Great Leap Forward, arranged the work for 1959, and preliminarily determined forty-three key research tasks.

During the conference, Chen Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, met with all the attendees and delivered an important speech. Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, gave a report at the conference.

The conference first summarized the experience of the leap forward in scientific work in 1958. The conference believed that in the past year, China's scientific research work had achieved great successes. Twenty-six provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have already established or are in the process of establishing branches of the Academy of Sciences. The quantity and quality of scientific research achievements nationwide have significantly improved. Scientific and technological fields such as atomic energy, computers, and automation, which were blank or very weak three years ago, have not only strengthened research institutions last year but have also made achievements in mastering new technologies. At the same time, a mass technological revolution movement has unfolded nationwide, and a number of outstanding innovators and inventors have emerged. The integration of professional scientific and technological research with mass technological innovation movements has given China's scientific and technological work abundant vitality and rapidly propelled it forward. The conference believed that the above achievements were mainly due to the Party strengthening its leadership over scientific undertakings and achieving a great victory in the struggle between the two roads in the field of scientific work; mobilizing the masses and emancipating minds, thereby enabling scientific work to undergo a more thorough reform and ushering in a leap forward. The conference pointed out that there were also some shortcomings and problems in scientific work last year, such as some research work still being somewhat rough; there were also some phenomena of imbalances between disciplines or inappropriate use of resources. Currently, these shortcomings and problems are being gradually overcome and resolved in the work.

After listening to and discussing the Chinese Academy of Sciences' "Report on the Arrangement of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Work in 1959 (Natural Science Section)," the conference preliminarily determined forty-three key research tasks for this year. Some of these tasks are emerging points in modern science, some are the foundation for new technologies and cutting-edge technologies in modern production, some are difficult problems in world scientific and technological research, and some are scientific and technological research conducted in conjunction with the characteristics of China's resources. The conference believed that in order to complete the research tasks for 1959, all research units should continue to implement the mass line, further strengthen the unity and cooperation between new and old scientific workers, fully rely on the initiative and enthusiasm of the majority, and fully utilize collective wisdom. Young scientific workers should pay attention to respecting and learning from the expertise of older scientists; older scientists should also pay attention to promoting the spirit of young scientific workers who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. At the same time, joint operations between institutes should be strengthened to effectively use resources and correctly solve the balance between various disciplines. There should be appropriate proportions in the arrangement of research work in cutting-edge science, major scientific issues in the national economy, and basic theory. The conference pointed out that last year, research units carried out joint operations, cooperated with each other, learned from each other's strengths, and made greater achievements with limited resources, demonstrating the superiority of the Academy of Sciences as a comprehensive entity. It proved that joint operations are a very good form of mass movement in scientific research work. The conference also pointed out that on the basis of joint operations, cooperation with external institutions should be strengthened, international cooperation should be strengthened, and assistance from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries should continue to be obtained.

While emphasizing that scientific research work must pay close attention to major scientific and technological issues in national economic construction, the conference also proposed that theoretical scientific research work must be strengthened. The conference believed that in theoretical research, the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy should continue to be implemented, academic activities should be vigorously carried out, the academic atmosphere should be enlivened, and the theoretical level of various disciplines should be continuously improved. For some basic theoretical research work that is relatively indirectly related to practice but of great significance, appropriate arrangements still need to be made in conjunction with the expertise of scientists.

The conference particularly emphasized the need to improve the quality of research work and required scientific workers to combine revolutionary vigor with a spirit of seeking truth from facts, guard against exaggeration, and prevent complacency. When conducting research experiments, they should strictly follow scientific experimental operating methods, procedures, and work systems, and strict quality assessments should be carried out at each stage of the work. Some scientific research work must also be subjected to economic and technical evaluation to facilitate promotion. Some also need to organize academic debates for mass evaluation.

The conference believed that because China's scientific undertakings are developing rapidly, it is necessary to continuously improve and supplement a large number of scientific cadres. Therefore, training cadres is an outstanding task in the next few years. All research units must take various measures, formulate training plans, and properly arrange the time for scientific personnel to work, labor, and study, ensuring them the necessary business hours per week according to different circumstances, in order to rapidly improve the professional level of scientific cadres. At the same time, Party organizations in all units must further strengthen political and ideological education work, help scientific workers carry out ideological transformation, continuously improve their political and ideological level and class consciousness, and use various methods to rapidly cultivate and expand a scientific workforce of the working class that is both red and expert.

In addition to the heads of local branches of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the directors of relevant research institutes, and more than 300 well-known scientists in various disciplines, 750 people from research units affiliated with the Academy of Sciences in Beijing attended the conference. Heads of Party and government of relevant scientific branches and research institutes and 60 people including Tao Menghe, Zhu Kezhen, Yan Jici, Yin Zanxun, Tong Dizhou, Yun Ziqiang, Hua Luogeng, Qian Sanqiang, Qian Xuesen, etc., made oral or written statements at the conference.

　　组织科学工作继续大跃进
　　自然科学研究所长会议确定今年重点研究任务
　　充分发挥集体智慧提高工作质量提高理论水平
    新华社14日讯　中国科学院7日到13日在北京举行自然科学研究所所长会议，按照合理使用力量，为“四大指标”服务的原则，组织科学工作继续大跃进，安排了1959年度的工作，初步确定了四十三项重点研究任务。
    会议期间，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅同志会见了到会的全体人员，并在会上作了重要讲话。中国科学院院长郭沫若在会上作了报告。
    会议首先总结了1958年科学工作跃进的经验。会议认为：过去一年中，我国科学研究工作获得了巨大成就，有二十六个省、市、自治区已经或正在建立科学院分院；全国各方面科学研究成果的数量、质量都有了显著提高，三年前还处于空白或十分薄弱状态的原子能、计算机、自动化等科学技术部门，去年不仅充实了研究机构，在掌握新技术方面也作出了成绩。同时，全国范围内展开了群众性的技术革命运动，出现了一批优秀的革新家、发明家。专业的科学技术研究和群众性的技术革新运动汇合在一起，使我国科学技术工作获得了充沛的生命力，迅速地向前发展。会议认为：上述成绩的获得，主要是由于党加强了对科学事业的领导，在科学工作领域里开展大破大立的两条道路的斗争取得了伟大的胜利；发动群众，解放思想，从而使科学工作获得了一次较彻底的革新，出现了跃进的局面。会议指出：去年科学工作中也存在若干缺点和问题，如有的研究工作还有些粗糙现象；各学科之间还有些不相适应或力量使用不适当等现象。目前，这些缺点和问题正在工作中逐步克服和解决。
    会议在听取和讨论了中国科学院“关于中国科学院1959年工作（自然科学部分）安排问题”的报告后，初步确定了今年四十三项重点研究任务。这些任务中，有的是现代科学中的新生点，有的是现代生产新技术和尖端技术的基础，有的是世界科学技术研究的难题，有的是结合我国资源特点所进行的科学技术研究。会议认为，为完成1959年的研究任务，各研究单位应继续贯彻群众路线，进一步加强新、老科学工作者之间的团结合作，充分依靠多数人的主动性和积极性，充分发挥集体智慧。青年科学工作者应注意尊重和学习老科学家的专长；老科学家也应注意发扬青年科学工作者敢想、敢说、敢做的精神。同时，还应加强所与所之间的联合作业，有效地使用力量，正确解决各门学科之间的平衡问题，对尖端科学、国民经济中重大科学问题和基本理论三方面研究工作的安排，要有适当比例。会议指出：去年各研究单位联合作业，相互配合，取长补短，发挥了科学院这个综合体的优越性，以有限的力量作出较大的成绩，证明联合作业是科学研究工作中群众运动的一种很好形式。会议还指出在联合作业的基础上，应当密切和院外的协作关系，加强国际合作，继续取得苏联和各兄弟国家科学界的帮助。
    会议在强调科学研究工作必须认真注意国民经济建设中的重大科学技术问题的同时，还提出必须加强科学理论研究工作。会议认为：在理论研究中，应继续贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，大力开展学术活动，活跃学术空气，不断提高各门学科的理论水平。对一些与实际联系比较间接而有重大意义的基本理论研究工作，仍然需要结合科学家的专长作适当安排。
    会议特别强调了要提高研究工作质量，要求科学工作人员把革命干劲和求实精神结合起来，戒浮夸，防骄气。在进行研究实验时，应该严格地遵照科学实验操作方法、程序和工作制度，在工作每告一段落时，都应进行严格的质量鉴定。有些科学研究工作还必须进行经济技术评价，以便于推广。有的还要组织学术性辩论会进行群众性评议。
    会议认为：由于我国科学事业正在飞速发展，需要不断提高和补充大量的科学干部。因此，培养干部是今后几年内的突出任务。各研究单位必须采取各种措施，定出培养计划，并很好安排科学人员工作、劳动、学习的时间，分别不同情况，保证他们每周必要的业务时间，以迅速提高科学干部的业务水平。同时，各单位党组织还必须进一步加强政治思想教育工作，帮助科学工作人员进行思想改造，不断提高他们的政治思想水平和阶级觉悟，用各种办法迅速培养、壮大工人阶级的又红又专的科学工作队伍。
    出席这次会议的，除中国科学院各地方分院负责人、有关各研究所所长和各学科著名科学家三百余人外，还有科学院所属在北京的各研究单位的七百五十人列席会议。各有关科学分院和研究所党政负责人和陶孟和、竺可桢、严济慈、尹赞勋、童第周、恽子强、华罗庚、钱三强、钱学森等六十人，在大会作了口头或书面发言。
