Make Full Use of Working Time
　　Beijing Automobile Repair Factory Plugs Loopholes Wasting Working Hours

    This newspaper reports (reporter Lei Runming): There is great potential to be tapped within the stipulated working hours. This is an important lesson learned by the No. 1 Branch of the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory in summarizing the production work in the first quarter.

    In the first quarter of this year, the factory completed the quarterly production plan half a month ahead of schedule without increasing equipment, personnel, or extending working hours. On average, each person overhauled 1.5 vehicles per month, an increase of 87.5% compared to the same period last year and 18% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The main reason for completing the plan ahead of schedule was to mobilize the masses to tap the potential within working hours. The workers believe that by making full use of working time, combining hard work with ingenuity, and without increasing equipment or personnel, production can also leap forward.

    During the discussion of the national plan at the beginning of the year, some people in the factory believed that "a great leap forward requires extending working hours." The factory's Party committee raised this issue for discussion among the masses. During the discussion, it was found that the stipulated working hours were not being fully utilized, and five major "loopholes" that prevented full utilization were discovered: First, some workers did not prepare for production before work, but put on work clothes and looked for tools after starting work; Second, the production plan was too general and not specific, and the coordination between various types of work and processes was not good, resulting in frequent idle work; Third, some things that could be delegated to the workshop groups were not, and workers had to queue up to collect tools and materials during working hours, wasting time; Fourth, the supply of some materials and parts processed by outside factories was not timely, resulting in work stoppages waiting for materials; Fifth, the life management department did not sell meal tickets, issue bath tickets, or haircut tickets after work, so workers had to do these things during production time, also wasting working hours. These "loopholes" meant that workers actually only worked for six hours or more each working day, and some for less than six hours. Subsequently, in order to plug these loopholes and make full use of production time, all the factory's employees put forward 366 suggestions for improvement.

    Based on the opinions put forward by the masses, and in response to the loopholes that had been discovered, the factory adopted the following measures: First, prepare materials in advance to ensure timely supply to the production departments; Second, the planners from the factory went deep into the workshops and groups to arrange work plans with the workers on a ten-day basis. The plan clearly stipulated what vehicles to repair, what materials and parts were needed, and the time for each process to complete its task, so that the plan was in the hands of the masses, everyone knew what to do, and each process was closely linked; Third, special tools and consumable materials for the groups were delegated to the groups, reducing the phenomenon of queuing up to collect them; Fourth, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient supply of certain materials and avoid work stoppages waiting for materials, vigorously strengthen the repair of old materials. In addition to these key measures, specific methods were also formulated in response to the waste of working hours and the opinions of the masses, such as ringing a preparation bell before work to allow workers to fully prepare for production; not selling meal tickets or issuing bath tickets and haircut tickets during working hours, etc.

    While plugging the loopholes, the workers also put forward three ways to improve labor efficiency within working hours from a positive perspective. That is, vigorously engage in technological revolution, everyone works cleverly; closely cooperate and coordinate between processes and types of work; check every day and every shift, grasp tightly and fiercely, and seize every second.

    In order to ensure that the production activities of each process and type of work are interconnected, after breaking through the weak links, the workers of each process and type of work also actively support each other to ensure the smooth completion of the factory's production tasks.

    In order to keep all employees in high spirits during working hours, the leading cadres of the factory conducted two inspections of production every day, and the workshops conducted inspections every shift, and promptly solved problems when they were discovered. In addition, the factory also announced the production progress of the entire factory and each workshop to the workers every day, and commended advanced units and individuals. This measure played a great role in promoting employees to make full use of production time.

    The summary of the factory's production experience in the first quarter strongly encouraged the confidence of all employees in striving for a greater leap forward. The workers are fighting with soaring enthusiasm to complete the leap forward plan of doubling production.

### 充分利用作业时间  北京汽车修配厂堵塞浪费工时的漏洞

　　充分利用作业时间
　　北京汽车修配厂堵塞浪费工时的漏洞
    本报讯　记者雷润明报道：在规定的作业时间内大有潜力可挖，这是北京汽车修配厂一分厂在总结第一季度生产工作中得出的一条重要经验。
    今年第一季度，这个厂在不增设备、不增人、也不延长工时的条件下，提前半个月完成了季度生产计划，平均每人每月大修车一点五部，比去年同期提高87.5％，比去年第四季度提高18％。提前完成计划的主要原因，是发动群众挖掘了作业时间内的潜力。职工们认为：充分利用作业时间，苦干巧干两结合，不增设备不增人，生产也可大跃进。
    在年初讨论国家计划的时候，这个厂有些人认为“要大跃进必须延长工时”。工厂党委就把这个问题提出来交给群众去讨论。讨论中一算账，发现规定的劳动时间并没有得到充分的利用，同时还发现了不能充分利用的五大“漏洞”：一、有些工人没有做好生产前的准备工作，上班后才穿工作服，找工具；二、生产计划很笼统，不具体，各工种工序间也衔接不好，经常发生窝工现象；三、一些可以下放到车间小组的东西没有下放，工人每天在上班时间排队领工具，领材料，浪费时间；四、有些材料和外厂加工部件供应不及时，停工待料；五、生活管理部门在下班时间不卖饭票，不发洗澡票和理发票，工人只有在生产时间去做这些事，也浪费了工时。这些“漏洞”，使工人的每个工作日实际上只干六个多小时的活，有的还不到六小时。接着，为了堵塞这些漏洞，充分利用生产时间，全厂职工提出了三百六十六项改进意见。
    这个厂根据群众提出来的意见，针对已经发现的漏洞，采取：一、提前备料，保证及时供应生产部门的需要；二、厂部计划员深入车间小组，和工人一起按旬安排作业计划，计划中明确规定修什么车、需要什么材料和部件，各工序完成任务的时间，作到计划为群众掌握，人人心中有数，各工序紧密衔接；三、小组专用工具和消耗材料下放小组，消减过去排队领取的现象；四、为了解决某些材料供应不足的困难，避免停工待料现象的发生，大力加强旧有材料的修复工作。除这些关键性措施外，还针对浪费工时的情况和群众意见，规定了一些具体办法，如上班前打预备钟，使工人充分做好生产前的准备；上班时间不卖饭票，不发洗澡票、理发票等。
    职工们在堵塞漏洞的同时，并从积极方面提出了在作业时间内提高劳动效率的三条途径。即大搞技术革命，人人巧干；工序工种之间密切协作配合；天天、班班检查，抓紧，抓狠，分秒必争。
    为了使各工序工种之间的生产活动互相衔接，在突破薄弱环节以后，各工序工种之间的工人，还主动互相支援，以保证全厂生产任务的顺利完成。
    为了在作业时间内使全体职工保持昂扬的斗志，这个厂的领导干部每天对生产进行两次检查，车间班班进行检查，发现问题及时解决。另外，每天还向职工公布全厂和各车间的生产进度，表扬先进单位和个人。这一措施对促使职工充分利用生产时间起了很大的作用。
    这个厂第一季度的生产经验总结，有力地鼓舞了全厂职工争取更大跃进的信心。职工们正以冲天的干劲为完成产量翻番的跃进计划而斗争。
