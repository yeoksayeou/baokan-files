Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 28th: Our agency's accompanying army reporter, Yu Fengyuan, reports: The People's Liberation Army's suppression of the rebellion in the Shannan area of Tibet strictly implements the Party's various policies and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, cherishing and helping the Tibetan people, and is warmly supported and loved by the Tibetan compatriots. "The People's Liberation Army is a heavenly army, caring for the common people everywhere." This kind of song praising the People's Liberation Army now resounds throughout the vast villages of the Shannan area of Tibet. "Never have we seen such a good army." When the People's Liberation Army is continuously marching day and night to pursue and wipe out the remnants of the bandits, wherever they go, the officers and soldiers put down their luggage and help the local Tibetan compatriots carry water, sweep the courtyard, and bandage wounds and treat illnesses for the injured Tibetan compatriots. Due to the slanderous propaganda of the rebel elements, in a village where the People's Liberation Army had not previously arrived, a Tibetan woman was suspicious and fearful, hiding in a suite of rooms before our army arrived. Later, she became very thirsty and mustered the courage to tiptoe out to find water to drink. When she looked outside, she was greatly surprised. The things in the room were intact, the butter lamp in front of the deity was still lit, and the floor was swept clean. When she looked in the kitchen, the pots and buckets were full of water everywhere, and even the basin in front of the yak was full of water. Where did the water come from? She was a little strange. It was not until a soldier carried water in again that she suddenly realized. This Tibetan woman ran around the village saying, "I really didn't expect the People's Liberation Army to be so good." A soldier from a certain platoon of the People's Liberation Army, in order to boil some milk for the wounded after the battle, but no one was at home at a landlord's house who had milk. This soldier had no choice but to take a little of his milk and firewood, leaving behind a silver dollar and a note before leaving. When this Tibetan compatriot returned home and saw the silver dollar and the note, he immediately rode a horse to catch up with the People's Liberation Army team and said to the soldiers, "I have lived in this world for more than fifty years and have never seen such a good army."

　　When the People's Liberation Army is pursuing and suppressing bandits, the officers and soldiers in the villages they arrive at do not enter civilian houses and camp outdoors. When a certain company was marching at night, they arrived at a village in the pouring rain, and the officers and soldiers were soaked to the skin. The officers and soldiers were hungry and cold, but they still stood quietly in the open air, waiting for the tents to be set up. Some Tibetan compatriots heard the barking of dogs and peeked out from the cracks in the door. Seeing this scene, they were greatly moved and took the initiative to open the door and invite the soldiers into the house and light a fire to dry their clothes.

　　"The Bodhisattva soldiers are here! Quickly lead the horses back!"

　　Because the People's Liberation Army does not commit the slightest offense wherever it goes, many Tibetan compatriots who fled into the deep mountains to seek refuge during the period when the bandits were entrenched are now leading yaks and horses, carrying clothes, silver and money, and returning to their hometowns from the deep mountains. An old farmer named Zhima Lhamo led a horse home from the barren mountains. When he saw a People's Liberation Army soldier at the edge of the village, he put his hands together and said, "In order to prevent my family's only horse from being robbed by the bandits, my horse and I have been enduring hunger, cold and the threat of wild animals in the barren mountains and valleys. From dark to dawn, I prayed to the Bodhisattva to give us an auspicious day. Sure enough, you and the auspicious day have arrived together. My old wife told me that she was also afraid when you first came here. Later, she saw that you paid for grass and firewood, spoke kindly, and helped my family fetch water and sweep the floor, so she carried her child to the place where we were hiding and said, 'The Bodhisattva soldiers are here! Quickly lead the horses back!' The old people in our village who were hiding in the mountains surrounded her and asked about the situation of you 'Bodhisattva soldiers', and they all happily went down the mountain."

　　"If you don't want it, I will kill the sheep and send the mutton to you."

　　A certain company was stationed in a village. In the midst of frequent combat marches, they used the little rest time they had to help the Tibetan old woman in the駐地sweep the floor, carry water, and wipe the windows, tables, and chairs. This day, this unit was about to transfer, and the old woman brought a sheep and insisted on giving it to this unit. The officers and soldiers declined again and again. The old woman said, "If you don't want it, I will kill the sheep and send the mutton to you." After the officers and soldiers repeatedly explained the People's Liberation Army's discipline of not taking a single needle or thread from the people, the old woman reluctantly pulled the sheep back. Recently, the enthusiastic Tibetan compatriots in the Shannan area have composed many folk songs to praise their liberators and protectors—the People's Liberation Army's suppression of the rebellion.

    解放军和吉祥一起到来了
    山南藏胞热情歌颂解放军纪律严明秋毫无犯
    逃进深山避难的藏胞纷纷牵牛带马回到家乡
    新华社拉萨28日电　本社随军记者于逢源报道：正在西藏山南地区扫荡叛匪的中国人民解放军平叛部队，严格执行党的各项政策和三大纪律、八项注意，爱护和帮助西藏人民，受到藏胞的热烈拥护和爱戴。“解放军是天兵，处处爱护老百姓”这一类藏胞赞扬解放军的歌声，现在响遍了西藏山南地区的广大村庄。“从来没见过这样好的军队” 人民解放军在昼夜连续行军追歼残匪时，每到一地，官兵们放下行装就帮助当地藏胞挑水、扫院子，替受伤的藏胞包扎伤口和治病。由于叛乱分子的污蔑宣传，在解放军过去没有到达过的一个村庄里，一个藏胞妇女心怀疑惧，在我军到达前躲藏在套间里，后来她口渴得厉害，就鼓起勇气蹑手蹑脚地出来找水喝。到外面一看，不禁使她大为惊奇，屋子里的东西原封未动，神像前的酥油灯还在亮着，地下扫得干干净净。再到厨房里一看，锅里、桶里到处都盛满了水，连牦牛跟前的盆子里也是水汪汪的。水从哪里来的呢？她真有点奇怪。直到一个战士又背水进来的时候，她才恍然大悟。这个藏族妇女跑到村中到处说：“我真没想到解放军会这样好。”人民解放军某排的一个战士，在战斗后为了给伤员煮点牛奶喝，可是一家有牛奶的房东家里却没有人，这位战士只好取用了他的一点牛奶和柴草后，留下一块大洋和一张纸条然后离去。这个藏胞回家看到大洋和纸条后，立刻骑马追上解放军队伍，向战士们说了这样一句话：“我在世上活了五十多岁，从来没有见过这样好的军队。”
    解放军在追剿叛匪时，所到的村庄，官兵们一律不进民房，都是在室外露营。某连黑夜行军时，在大雨滂沱中到了一个村庄，官兵们一个个全身淋得透湿。官兵们又饿又冷，但仍然在露天下静悄悄地站着，等待架好帐篷。有一些藏胞听到狗吠声，从门缝向外张望，看见这种情景，不禁大受感动，纷纷主动开门邀请战士们进屋里去，并且生起了火给他们烤衣服。
    “菩萨兵来啦！快牵马回去吧！”
    由于人民解放军每到一处秋毫无犯，许多在叛匪盘踞期间逃进深山避难的藏胞，现在都纷纷牵着牦牛和马匹，携带着衣物、银钱从深山里回到家乡。一个名叫芝嘛拉姆的老农民从荒山上牵着马回家，一到村边见了解放军战士，就合着双手说：“为了不使我家仅有的一匹马被叛匪抢去，我和我的马在荒山深谷里，经受着饥饿、寒冷和野兽的威胁。我从天黑到天明乞求着菩萨赐给我们一个吉祥的日子。果然，你们和吉祥的日子一起到来了。听我的老妻说，你们头天来到这里，她也害怕。后来看到你们买草给草钱，买柴给柴钱，说话又和气，还帮我家打水扫地，于是她背着孩子跑到我们躲避的地方说：‘菩萨兵来啦！快牵马回去吧！’我们村上躲在山里的老百姓围着她，问清了你们这些‘菩萨兵’的情况，都高兴地下山回来了。”
    “你们不要，我就杀了羊把羊肉送给你们。”
    某连驻在一个村子里，在频繁的作战行军中，利用很少的休息时间，帮助驻地的藏族老阿妈扫地、挑水，擦拭窗户、桌、椅，这一天，这支部队要转移，这位老阿妈牵来一只羊，硬要送给这支部队。官兵们一再谢绝。老阿妈说：“你们不要，我就杀了羊把羊肉送给你们。”官兵们再三说明解放军不取人民一针一线的纪律后，这位老阿妈才勉强把羊拉回去。热情的山南地区藏胞们最近编了许多民歌赞扬他们的解放者和保卫者——人民解放军平叛大军。
