Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The China Taoist Association issued a statement firmly supporting the State Council's order to quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the Tibetan local government that instigated the rebellion.

The statement said that the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, under the guise of religion, secretly colluded with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to openly launch a rebellion, attempting to create a split in the motherland, undermine national unity, and achieve their reactionary goals of long-term rule and exploitation of the Tibetan people. This criminal act of betraying the motherland is intolerable by national law and impermissible by religious doctrines. Taoists in our association, like the people of the whole country, express great indignation at this small group of rebels. On behalf of Taoists nationwide, our association declares: We wholeheartedly support the wise measures taken by the State Council to dissolve the Tibetan local government and quell the rebellion, and we express our respect to the People's Liberation Army and patriotic Tibetan people who are bravely fighting the enemy to defend the unity of the motherland. We demand that this small group of scum who engage in treason under the cloak of religion be swiftly eliminated so that the Tibetan people, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, can gradually embark on the bright path of prosperity and progress.

    讨平西藏叛乱　肃清叛国分子
    中国道教协会发表声明拥护国务院命令
    新华社3日讯　中国道教协会发表声明，坚决拥护国务院平息西藏叛乱和解散策动叛乱的西藏地方政府的命令。
    声明说，西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，打着宗教的幌子暗地里勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和国外反动派，公开发动叛乱，妄图制造祖国分裂，破坏民族团结，达到他们长期统治和压榨西藏人民的反动目的。这种背叛祖国的犯罪行为，为国法所不容，为宗教教规所不允，我会的道教徒同全国人民一样，对这一小撮叛乱分子都表示极大的愤慨。我会代表全国道教徒声明：我们衷心拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府和讨平叛乱的英明措施，并向为捍卫祖国统一而英勇对敌人进行斗争的人民解放军和藏族爱国人民表示敬意。我们要求迅速把这一小撮披着宗教外衣而进行叛国活动的败类肃清，使西藏人民在中央人民政府领导下，逐步走上繁荣进步的光明大道。
