　　Generosity with Others' Money

　　On April 4th, Eisenhower, in his speech at Gettysburg College, spoke with a compassionate tone, saying that Japan, which relies on exports to survive, had a large trade deficit last year and was in a difficult situation. He believed that "Japan must now have more trade outlets." He also generously called on Southeast Asian countries and "every industrial nation in the West" to provide Japan with such trade "outlets."

　　The United States has expressed this kind of cheap sympathy and generosity more than once. For many years, the Kishi Nobusuke group has also been using the guise of "developing East Asia" to try its best to squeeze into the Southeast Asian market and seize the trade positions of countries such as Britain in the Far East. However, Japan's "southward" steps are facing increasing resistance. Therefore, Eisenhower's words are certainly able to satisfy the Kishi Nobusuke group.

　　But Eisenhower dared not talk about the United States' responsibility for "Japan's trade deficit." The United States has always plundered Japan by means of "exporting more and importing less" and monopolized Japan's foreign trade. Japan has repeatedly asked the United States to relax import restrictions on Japanese goods, but has been ignored. In his speech, Eisenhower also said: "Naturally, we must prevent the goods of other countries from flooding our markets." Eisenhower's calculation of being generous with other people's money is really well-calculated.

### 慷他人之慨

    慷他人之慨
    本月4日，艾森豪威尔在葛底斯堡学院发表的演说中，以悲天悯人的口吻，说靠出口过活的日本，去年贸易赤字很大，处境困难，认为“日本现在必须有更多的贸易出路”。他并且慷而慨之地要东南亚地区国家和“西方的每一个工业国家”都给日本提供这种贸易“出路”。
    美国表示的这种廉价的同情和慷慨，已经不止一次。岸信介集团多年来也正是打着“开发东亚”的幌子，竭力挤进东南亚市场，并夺取英国等国在远东的贸易阵地。但日本这种“南进”的步骤，正在遭到越来越大的反抗。因此，艾森豪威尔的话当然是能够使岸信介集团感到满意的。
    但是艾森豪威尔不敢谈一下美国对“日本的贸易赤字”是负有责任的。美国一向以“多出少进”的手段，掠夺日本，并垄断日本的对外贸易。日本屡次要求美国放宽对日货的进口限制，都得不到理睬。这次艾森豪威尔在演说中还说：“很自然，我们必须防范其他国家的货物充斥我们的市场”。艾森豪威尔慷他人之慨的算盘，真打得到家了。
