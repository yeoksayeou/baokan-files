Bats and Swallows
Ruo Lu

There once was a fairy tale: a bat and a swallow were arguing. The swallow said that sunrise is dawn and sunset is dusk, while the bat insisted that sunset is dawn and sunrise is dusk. Neither would yield, so they decided to ask the phoenix. On the way, they met a bird, who said, "Don't bother asking. That phoenix is always dozing, as lazy as a fox!"

This fairy tale is ostensibly about arguing over dawn and dusk, but in reality, it's about the bat and the swallow subtly boasting about their own merits! Because, if we investigate the basis of their statements, the swallow would surely say, "Of course! I work at sunrise and rest at sunset every day." And the bat would interject, "I work at sunset and rest at sunrise every day, and I never stop, except during the harsh winter!"

Indeed, as soon as the sky begins to lighten, the swallow has already left its nest to fly, and only at the twilight of dusk can you see bats dancing gracefully in front of houses. Common swallows may seem all the same at first glance, but there are actually differences between swiftlets, barn swallows, house martins, and sand martins. Swiftlets are entirely black, larger than other swallows, and their calls are very shrill. Barn swallows have white bellies and two long, slender tails. House martins are similar to barn swallows but lack the slender tails. Sand martins are the smallest, and from below, they are entirely brownish-yellow. Their commonality, besides their chirping calls, is their flying posture, as the Book of Odes says: "Swallows fly, up and down." That is to say, the swallow's flight is constantly rising and falling, so some say they like to dance. In fact, they do this only to chase insects. Swallows have short, large beaks, with the corners of their mouths almost reaching their eyes, and their flying speed is very high—swiftlets can fly 190 kilometers per hour; therefore, the number of insects that die in their beaks is truly countless. Some roughly estimate that if the insects eaten by a swallow in one summer are lined up, they would reach a kilometer in length. Entomologists who have studied swallows all say they are beneficial to humans, which seems very fair.

Is the bat's ability to catch insects inferior to the swallow's? According to early estimates, a bat eats at least three thousand insects in one night. It can be seen that the two are really difficult to distinguish in terms of catching insects.

In addition to catching insects, there is a type of swiftlet that lives on small islands in Southeast Asia (also found on small islands in China's southeast territorial waters), the nests of which are called bird's nest, a delicacy. It contains about 57% crude protein, 22% carbohydrates, about 8% inorganic salts, and a small amount of fat. However, bats provide feces for people to use; the Chinese medicine "night-blooming cereus" is such a thing. The accumulation of feces into piles is also a good fertilizer.

Are swallows and bats harmful to humans? Of course, some inevitably are. Swallows sometimes kill some small vertebrates indiscriminately, and occasionally transmit parasites and diseases. Among bats, there is a large bat, most common in the tropics, that feeds on animal blood and even sucks human blood. However, these degenerates are ultimately in the minority. Overall, the harm is very small, and both can be said to be animals with great benefits.

Bats and swallows should be treated equally, but people seem to have a slight preference for swallows and aversion to bats. The "Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang" earnestly advises people to attract swallows, although it inevitably has superstitious overtones, but attracting them is right, but attention should be paid to the method. It is said that many artificial nest boxes in Moscow were originally set up to attract various beneficial birds, but many were occupied by bats. Soviet students (most of Moscow's artificial nest boxes are made by students) not only forgave the bats, but also, seeing that they liked to respond to the call, specially set up special houses for them!

### 蝙蝠和燕子

    蝙蝠和燕子
    若卢
    有过这么一个童话故事：蝙蝠和燕子有一次争论起来了，燕子说日出为旦，日入为夕，而蝙蝠则认定日入为旦，日出为夕。彼此相持不让，便打算去问凤凰，走到中途，却遇到一只鸟，鸟说：“不必去问了，那凤凰一天到晚瞌睡，懒得像训狐一样哩！”
    这童话表面上是争旦夕，实际上是蝙蝠和燕子彼此暗地在标榜自己的功劳吧！因为，如果追究一下它们立说的根据，那燕子一定会说：“可不是么！我每天都是日出而作，日入而息。”而蝙蝠却会插嘴道：“我每天日入而作，日出而息，除了严寒的冬天，从来也没有间断过啊！”
    的确，每当天刚发白，燕子早已离巢飞翔去了，而暮色苍茫的时分，才可看到蝙蝠在堂前屋后，翩翩起舞。常见的燕子，乍看似乎都一样，实际上有雨燕、家燕、毛脚燕、沙燕的区别。雨燕全身是黑色，较其他的燕大，叫声非常尖锐。家燕的腹部是白的，尾部拖着两条长长的小辫。毛脚燕和家燕相近，但没有小辫。沙燕最小，从下面看，全是黄褐色的。它们的共同点，除了都能啁啁啾啾地叫以外，飞翔的姿态也相同，诗经上说：“燕燕于飞，颉之颃之。”就是说燕子的飞，是忽上忽下的，所以有人便说它们喜欢跳舞。其实它们所以这样，只不过为了追捕昆虫而已。燕子的嘴短而大，口角差不多裂到了眼边，飞行的速度又很高——雨燕每小时可飞一百九十公里；所以死于它们喙下的昆虫，实在难以数计。有人粗略估量说，如果把一只燕子在一个夏季捕食的昆虫排成一线，足可达一公里之长。昆虫学家对燕子作鉴定，都说它们对人类有益，看来是非常公允的。
    蝙蝠的捕虫能力，是不是不如燕子呢？据早年的估计，一只蝙蝠在一夜间捕食的虫类，至少有三千多只。可见在捕虫这一点上，二者实在难分高下。
    除捕虫以外，有一种居住在南洋一带小岛上的金丝燕（我国东南领海的小岛上也有），它结成的窠就是号称山珍海味的燕窠，它含有约57％的粗蛋白质，22％的碳水化合物，8％左右的无机盐类和少量的脂肪。不过蝙蝠却有粪便供给人们应用，中药中的夜明砂就是这种东西。粪便积累成堆，更是一种上好的肥料。
    燕子和蝙蝠是不是对人类有害呢？当然难免要有一些。燕子有时就不分青红皂白，把一些小的脊椎动物也杀害了，偶然也传播寄生虫和疾病。在蝙蝠中，则有一种大蝙蝠，热带地方最多，它们以动物的血为食，甚至还吸人的血。不过这些败类究竟是少数。总起来说，害处都很小，两者还是都可以称得上是有大益的动物。
    对于蝙蝠和燕子，理应一视同仁，但人们却似乎偏偏有点爱燕子而恶蝙蝠。“酉阳杂俎”殷殷劝人招燕，虽不免有迷信意味，但招引是对的，只是要注意方法。据说莫斯科的许多人工巢箱，原是为招引各种益鸟而设的，可是有很多却被蝙蝠强占了，苏联的学生们（莫斯科的人工巢箱，大多是学生们制作的）不仅原谅了蝙蝠，并且看到它们既喜欢应招，还特地为它们设置了特殊的房舍哩！
