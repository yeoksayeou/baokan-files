      Complete Ten Years' Worth of Work in One Year
      Yu Zhengyuan, a young molder in the Ninth Workshop of the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, boldly promoted advanced working methods such as the local method of mud-sand mixing molding, breaking the superstitious idea that sand casting of castings could not be increased exponentially. He proposed to guarantee the completion of ten years' worth of work this year, with a product qualification rate of 99.5%. This is Yu Zhengyuan using the mud-sand mixing molding method to create a cast iron model of a medium-sized motor end cover.
