To Enrich People's Lives and Increase Cash Income

Sichuan Hastens to Plant Minor Crops

Chengdu, April 1st (reported by this newspaper) – While focusing on major production during the intense spring planting season, Sichuan is also paying attention to minor production. While sowing major crops such as rice, corn, and sweet potatoes, they are also seizing the season to vigorously plant minor crops such as glutinous rice, miscellaneous grains, melons, and beans.

How to ensure that minor crops are not squeezed out in the campaign for large-scale, high-yield grain production is a problem that Sichuan Province has paid close attention to from the beginning of this year. Many regions have issued special instructions for this purpose and have widely organized discussions among the masses. The masses in many communes, such as Nanchuan and Pixian, unanimously agreed in the discussions that minor crops are essential for the lives of both urban and rural people. They can adjust life, save food, diversify food, and increase the cash income of the commune. Members of the Zhongao Commune in Dazu County calculated that if each person in the commune plants three jin of green beans and each household plants two hundred pumpkin plants, the annual income would be enough for the commune to pay more than half a year's wages. The Taiping Commune in Pixian County calculated that if the commune completes the plan of more than 4.91 million jin of melons and beans this year, it can generate a cash income of more than 190,000 yuan. These efforts have greatly increased the masses' understanding and enthusiasm for planting minor crops.

In order to ensure that minor crops are planted on time, in the required quantity, and with good quality, all localities have formulated production plans for minor crops at all levels. Each commune in the Neijiang Special District uses 10% of its land to plant various minor crops, and at the same time, vigorously mobilizes the masses to use the edges of fields and open spaces to plant melons and beans. In terms of manpower, most localities have adopted the method of assigning a certain amount of labor to organize professional teams for planting. These laborers are generally mainly auxiliary labor. In terms of seeds and fertilizers, all localities rely on the masses to exchange seeds, contribute seeds, and invest in a certain amount of fertilizer, which is resolved quickly and well. Minor crops such as melons and beans planted by commune members themselves are generally determined to be harvested by the commune members themselves for raising livestock and poultry or improving their lives.

All localities have adopted various measures to strive for high yields of minor crops. The Qianfeng People's Commune in Ziyang County plans to increase soybean production by two times compared to last year, sorghum production by 160%, and glutinous rice production by nearly one time this year. In terms of technology, they have implemented many measures such as deep plowing, close planting, and fertilization. For example, soybeans have been changed from not applying base fertilizer to applying more base fertilizer, strip planting, and close planting. Sorghum land is deeply ploughed more than one chi, and direct seeding is changed to transplanting. More than 1,000 mu of early corn planted by the Xinzheng District of Nanbu County was all deeply ploughed one chi and five cun, and 20,000 jin of high-quality fertilizer was applied per mu, with a close planting spacing of one chi and two cun. Since March, Sichuan has used various gaps to carry out a blitz planting campaign for minor crops. The crops planted include sorghum, millet, sunflowers, peppers, and various melons and beans. Wanxian planted more than 4 million melon seedlings and more than 20 million bean seedlings in two days, and sowed more than 1,000 jin of sunflower seeds. (Yu Jingqi)

    丰富人民生活增加现金收入
    四川赶种小宗作物
    本报成都1日电　四川各地在紧张的春播中，既抓大宗生产也不放松小宗生产，他们在播种水稻、玉米、红苕等大宗作物的同时，抓紧季节大力抢种糯米、杂粮、瓜、豆等小宗作物。
    在开展粮食大面积高产运动中，如何保证不把小宗作物挤掉，是四川省各地今年一开始就十分注意的问题。许多地区为此专门发出指示，并广泛组织群众进行了讨论。南川、郫县等不少公社群众在讨论中一致认为：小宗作物都是城乡人民生活中必不可少的东西，既可以调节生活、节约粮食、使伙食多样化，又可以增加公社现金收入。大足县中敖公社社员们算了一笔帐，全社每人种三斤四季豆，每户二百株南瓜，全年收入就够公社发半年以上的工资。郫县太平公社计算，全社如果今年完成四百九十一万多斤瓜豆的计划，就可收入现金十九万多元。经过这些工作，大大提高了群众对种小宗作物的认识和热情。
    为了保证小宗作物按时、按量、按质种好，各地都层层制订了小宗作物的生产计划。内江专区各公社以10％的土地种植各种小宗作物，同时还大力发动群众利用田边、空地栽种瓜豆。在人力上，各地大都采取划出一定劳力组织专业队种植的办法。这些劳力一般都以辅助劳力为主。在种子、肥料等方面，各地也都依靠群众换种、献种和投资一定肥料，解决得又快又好。社员自种的瓜豆等小宗作物，一般都确定由社员自己收获，用以饲养家畜家禽，或改善生活。
    各地采用各种措施力争小宗作物高产。资阳县前锋人民公社今年计划黄豆比去年增产两倍，高粱增产160％，糯米增产近一倍。在技术上，他们实行了深耕、密植、施肥等许多措施。如黄豆由不施底肥改为多施底肥，条播密植。高粱地深翻一尺以上，改直播为移栽等。南部县新政区抢种的早包谷一千多亩全部深耕一尺五，每亩施优质肥料二万斤，密植株距一尺二寸。从3月份以来，四川各地利用各种空隙开展了小宗作物的突击播种运动。播种的作物有高粱、小米、向日葵、辣椒和各种瓜豆。万县两天中就种了四百多万窝瓜和两千多万窝豆，播种向日葵种子一千多斤。　（于竞祁）
