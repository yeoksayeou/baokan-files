The Tianjin Belt Conveyor Factory, which manufactures mining and coal washing equipment, built on its success in completing its first-quarter production plan twenty-six days ahead of schedule. Since entering April, it has been fully exceeding the state plan daily in the red flag competition for high quality and high output. By the 9th, it had completed the task of forty belt conveyors for the first ten days of the month one day ahead of schedule, and exceeded the value of production plan by 7%.

In order to complete the state plan on time, with quality and quantity in the second quarter, and to support key construction projects, the factory's Party branch formed a special team at the beginning of April composed of representatives from the Party, government, labor union, the Communist Youth League, and workers. They conscientiously summarized the production and work experience of the first quarter, explained the tasks to the workers, clarified the problems existing in production, mobilized them to engage in vigorous airing of views, big-character posters, and a great technical revolution to improve labor productivity, launched a red flag competition for high quality and high output, and set off a greater production upsurge. In the competition, various work sections and groups formed a heated atmosphere of catching up with each other and challenging each other within a few days, put forward twenty-five major technical innovation proposals, and sixteen of them have been realized, which played a significant role in completing the production plan. Gui Changsheng, a municipal-level labor model in the machine work section, and veteran workers Deng Lanqing, Markov, etc., in order to demand efficiency from machines, changed the hexagon lathe for producing belt conveyor couplings from processing with one tool to processing with three tools, increasing the daily output of couplings from three to thirteen. Municipal-level labor model lathe operator Gao Xingkai and others, after careful study of the products, changed the process of machining rollers from six steps to three steps, which not only ensured quality, but also reduced the processing time of each roller by four and a half hours, allowing the whole group to exceed the production plan by 3% to 36% every day. The workers in the riveting section, based on the characteristics of their section with a lot of manual labor, used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to vigorously promote mechanization. Veteran worker Wang Maohai and others used waste materials to manufacture a straightening hammer to replace manual straightening of steel, which increased the labor efficiency of straightening 120 cm channel steel by about 66%, and greatly reduced physical labor.

While mobilizing workers to vigorously engage in technical revolution and carry out competitions, the Party branch secretary and the factory director also specifically divided the work to go deep into the work sections and groups every day to understand the production progress on time and daily, solve problems in a timely manner, and also publicize the production achievements and progress of each work section, each group, and each worker every day, so that the workers could always have a clear picture, which made the completion of the plan more guaranteed for the whole factory at all times and on a daily basis.

　　技术革命开花　劳动效率提高
　　天津皮带运输机厂提前完成上旬计划
    本报天津10日电　制造矿山洗煤设备的天津皮带运输机制造厂的职工，在提前二十六天完成第一季度生产计划的基础上，乘胜前进，进入4月份以来，在优质、高产的红旗竞赛中，时时、日日全面超额完成了国家计划。到9日就提前一天完成了上旬四十台皮带运输机的任务，并且超额7％完成产值计划。
    这个工厂的党支部，为了在第二季度按质按量按日完成国家计划，支援重点建设，4月初就组成由党政工团和职工代表参加的专门小组，认真总结第一季度的生产和工作经验，同时向职工交代任务，讲明生产中存在的问题，发动他们大鸣、大放、大搞技术革命，提高劳动生产率，开展优质高产的红旗竞赛，掀起更大的生产高潮。在竞赛中，各个工段、小组几天之内，就形成了你追我赶、互相叫阵的热烈局面，提出了重大技术革新建议二十五件，并有十六件已经实现，对完成生产计划起了重大作用。机工工段的市级劳动模范归长生和老工人邓蓝清、马可夫等为了向机器要效率，将生产皮带运输机的联轴节的六角车床由原来的一个刀加工改为三个刀加工，使原来日产三个联轴节提高到十三个。市级劳动模范车工高兴凯等经过对产品的细密研究，将加工滚筒的工序由六道改为三道，不但保证质量，而且使每个滚筒的加工时间减少了四个半小时，使全组日日超额3％—36％完成生产计划。铆工工段的工人们根据本工段手工劳动多的特点，用土洋结合的办法大搞机械化。老工人王茂海等用废料制造了一台调直锤代替手工调直钢材，使调直一百二十厘米槽钢的劳动效率提高了66％左右，而且大大减轻了体力劳动。
    这个厂在发动职工大搞技术革命，开展竞赛的同时，党支部书记和厂长还具体分工每天都深入工段、小组，按时按日了解生产进度，及时解决问题，并且每天还把每一个工段、每一个小组、每一个工人的生产成绩和进度公布出去，让职工随时心中有数，使得全厂时时、日日完成计划更有保证。（附图片）
