We fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and we are determined to work hard in our respective posts to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan!

Now, please allow us to speak about our experiences with the Great Leap Forward and the self-transformation of the industrial and commercial circles in Sichuan Province as follows.

1958 was a year of the all-round Great Leap Forward for our country. Like all other parts of the country, Sichuan Province achieved great successes in all aspects. Unprecedented bumper harvests of grain and cotton were reaped, and steel production increased many times over. Under the guidance of the Party's policy of "taking steel as the key link and promoting an all-round leap forward," the entire industrial and agricultural production, capital construction, transportation, science and technology, culture and education, health, and other aspects have achieved unprecedented development and improvement. With the development of the Great Leap Forward in production and the urgent demands of the peasants, rural areas have realized communization. The communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, breaking down superstitions, and liberating the mind, as well as the collectivist spirit of hard work, practical work, clever work, and mutual cooperation among the broad masses of working people, are growing and expanding in general. People's mental outlook has been completely renewed, and their material and cultural lives have been significantly improved. According to what we have seen and heard during our inspections, visits, and interviews in rural areas and factories, countless vivid facts and rapidly changing scenes show the leaping changes and developments everywhere. We have indeed received profound socialist education. This encouraging and rapidly developing situation makes us deeply feel the greatness and loveliness of our motherland. As citizens of the People's Republic of China, we are truly proud. We are even more sincerely convinced that only under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can we achieve such unprecedented and world-shaking miracles of the Great Leap Forward, and we have further recognized the unparalleled greatness and correctness of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, as well as the entire set of guidelines and policies formulated based on the general line.

Although industrialists and businessmen have made progress to varying degrees, most still have two sides to them.

Under the brilliant light of the general line, inspired and influenced by the encouraging situation of the Great Leap Forward and the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and peasants, and under the correct leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPC and Party committees at all levels, our industrial and commercial circles in Sichuan Province, having received education in the rectification movement, have shifted to the practice of productive labor. Over the past year or so, the political thoughts of most people have gradually changed to varying degrees, and they have taken a step closer to the Party. However, due to the limitations of their political stand, the majority of our industrialists and businessmen did not find it so easy to accept and correctly understand the general line of building socialism and the Great Leap Forward at first. Some even believed that "greater and faster cannot be combined with better and more economical," that "the leap forward is not comprehensive," and that "the Great Leap Forward is too intense and cannot be sustained." They had doubts and anxieties about the people's communes. Only through the education of the numerous inspiring facts that emerged during the Great Leap Forward, their own experiences in practice, and continuous study and discussion, did they gradually realize that the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in all aspects were indeed incomparably brilliant, and the achievements made in just a few months were unimaginable and dared not be imagined in the past. With the establishment and consolidation of the people's communes, the tremendous development of productive forces, and the rapid improvement of people's lives, an even more beautiful and happy prospect is portrayed for us in the future. Only in this way can we change the poor and blank state of our motherland and never be subjected to imperialist aggression. If we start from the interests of the 600 million people and the happiness of future generations to calculate this grand account, it is truly gratifying and inspiring. All kinds of doubts and worries are nothing more than playing petty calculations within the confines of one's own personal circle. At the same time, in the context of such a Great Leap Forward, the Party has also taken special care of us, reaffirming that the fixed interest policy will remain unchanged for seven years, high wages will remain unchanged, and urban people's communes will also give us some time to wait. For many of our industrialists' and businessmen's family members, work arrangements have been given, increasing their income. The Party has continuously and patiently provided education and assistance for the various ideological concerns that we have, which has made us industrialists and businessmen deeply feel that the Party is truly caring and considerate to us, thereby strengthening our confidence and determination to take the socialist road. Everyone deeply feels that whether from the perspective of the country's future or personal interests, we should actively do our job well, add a brick or tile to the motherland, and contribute our ideas and skills to fulfill the responsibilities that new Chinese citizens should fulfill in order to keep up with the pace of the times and repay the Party's kindness to us. Therefore, most people have successively participated in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward, engaging in technical and cultural revolutions to varying degrees. Many people have contributed their skills and ideas, putting forward rationalization proposals and technical innovation suggestions. After some of these suggestions and opinions were adopted, they played a certain role in improving labor productivity, saving raw materials, improving service quality, and solving key problems in enterprises. Some people also worked with employees to compile technical data, commercial knowledge, pharmaceutical documents, and other documents. Some people also combined with workers to successfully trial-produce new products. In Chengdu, Chongqing, and Zigong alone, more than 400 types were manufactured, among which products such as gold-colored canned coatings, fast pigment printing dyes, sulfanilimide, monosodium glutamate, zinc chloride, fluorosilicic acid, and seranine reached the advanced level in China or caught up with or surpassed the level of capitalist countries. Industrial and commercial circles in many areas of the province responded to the call of "the whole people running industry," and under the leadership of the local Party committees, they also established various small factories, such as the welding rod factory in Chengdu and the iron smelting plant in Gucheng County. Since they were established last year, they have not only maintained normal production and business development and been included in the national plan, but have also obtained surpluses. They have also achieved results in political and ideological transformation and in cultivating technical skills. In order to support industrial and agricultural production and better transform ourselves in the practice of labor, the majority of industrialists and businessmen, in addition to participating in the work of their own enterprises, also participated in short-term labor within their capacity. Those who have made achievements in productive labor have been praised and encouraged. From these productive labor practices, we have received vivid and realistic socialist education, practically experienced the principles of labor being glorious and exploitation being shameful, and realized that the working people possess infinite wisdom and noble qualities, thereby overcoming to a certain extent the erroneous thoughts and viewpoints of despising the working people, conservative thinking, private technology, superstition in books, superstition in foreign countries, valuing foreign goods over domestic goods, and valuing business over politics. In terms of ideological feelings, we have begun to shorten the distance with the working people. The above situation shows that under the leadership of the Party, Sichuan's industrialists and businessmen have shown good performance and made progress to varying degrees in their work of serving socialism and on the road of self-transformation over the past year or so. However, this progress does not mean that our political positions and thoughts have been transformed well. For example, on the issue of the Party's leadership, although many people have a side of admiration and gratitude, they still have doubts, suspicions, and half-heartedness on specific issues. On the fundamental issue of political position transformation, although most people admitted after the rectification campaign that they wanted to accept transformation, after a period of labor practice, there was a tendency to overestimate their progress, thinking that "the transformation is almost complete," and there are still feelings of weariness towards transformation on the road of progress. In the work of serving socialism, due to the fact that the political position has not yet been resolved, some people lack motivation, are content with being in the middle, or are cold and hot, advancing and retreating at times. Some become arrogant and complacent after making achievements. These situations show that the majority of us have not yet reached the level of changing from a capitalist position to a socialist position, and have not yet reached the level of breaking away from the two-sidedness. According to the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao, there is obviously still a considerable distance. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen the fundamental transformation of our political position and thought. Looking back on the self-transformation process we have experienced, we deeply realize that the fundamental transformation of us industrialists and businessmen is a process of repeated, long-term, and arduous self-struggle. Only by making up our minds to continuously improve our awareness, strengthen transformation, actively serve, resolutely listen to Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party, and take the socialist road can we complete the transition to the working people and become glorious workers in the true sense of the word.

Closely combine transformation with service; the process of serving socialism is the process of self-transformation.

1959 is a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in our country's construction of socialism. The national economic plan is incomparably magnificent, and the future is infinitely bright. The working people of the whole country are fighting with high morale and spiritedly, going all out and continuing to fight heroically to realize this great plan. For more than three months, good news has been constantly coming from all fronts, one victory after another, which has further inspired the people of the whole country to move forward with confidence and courage. In this great era where one day equals twenty years, Sichuan Province's industrialists and businessmen, under the leadership of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPC, must strive to catch up, closely follow in the footsteps of the working people, and actively devote themselves to the ranks of building socialism, earnestly do well in their enterprises or job posts, actively participate in technical and cultural revolutions around the central tasks of the enterprise, enthusiastically contribute ideas and suggestions, strive to make achievements, and continuously "establish while breaking down" to strengthen self-transformation in practice. Strive to ensure that the number of people whose political and ideological transformation generally conforms to the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao gradually increases, laying the foundation for the further fundamental transformation of the industrial and commercial circles in our province.

We have come to realize that to truly serve socialism, we must closely combine transformation with service. For a long time, we bourgeois elements have been looking at problems from a capitalist standpoint, and our understanding of new socialist things has class limitations. If we do not put politics in command and value our own transformation, we cannot correctly understand the Party's guidelines and policies, and it will not be easy to fully exert our initiative in specific work. At the same time, our capitalist standpoints and views will be constantly reflected in the practice of serving socialism. Through education and assistance, and with our own efforts, we can overcome and solve them. It can be seen that the process of serving socialism is a process of constantly developing initiative and constantly overcoming negativity, and it is also a process of self-transformation. Service and transformation are complementary and mutually promoting. From several facts in Sichuan's industrial and commercial circles, it is proven that whoever recognizes the necessity of self-transformation and strives to strengthen self-transformation will make achievements in service work, and at the same time, will continuously gain progress in the process of active service. Therefore, in practice, we must pay attention to the transformation of our political stand, overcome negative phenomena such as insufficient motivation, contentment with being in the middle, being cold and hot, and advancing and retreating at times, so that we can truly serve socialism.

In transformation, some progress quickly and some progress slowly. The key lies in whether they can sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, not be of two minds, but accept the leadership of the Party wholeheartedly.

We further realize that to strengthen the fundamental transformation of the political position, the most important thing is to wholeheartedly and unconditionally accept the leadership of the Party and sincerely support and implement the Party's various guidelines and policies. The Party is the core force leading all undertakings in our country, and any work will inevitably accomplish nothing if it is separated from the Party's leadership. Especially for us industrialists and businessmen, since the issue of which road to take has not yet been resolved, it is even more unimaginable to serve socialism and transform ourselves into genuine workers if we do not closely rely on the leadership of the Party. In fact, the Party has always patiently educated and helped us industrialists and businessmen in accordance with the policy of peaceful transformation, hoping that we will continue to make progress and contribute to socialist construction. However, in the transformation, some progress quickly and some progress slowly. The key lies in whether they can sincerely accept the leadership of the Party. Some comrades in Sichuan's industrial and commercial circles can lean towards the Party and earnestly study the Party's guidelines and policies, so it is easier for them to accept the Party's help and education, continuously break down capitalist positions and viewpoints, and make greater progress and achievements in self-transformation and service work. Therefore, we must eliminate our reservations about the Party and wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the Party in thought and action, especially to obey the leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations, so that we can make achievements in our work and better transform ourselves.

Premier Zhou pointed out in the Government Work Report: This year's main task for the people of the whole country is to actively strive to complete and overfulfill this national economic plan centered on the four major indicators. We will certainly follow Premier Zhou's instructions and, together with the industrialists and businessmen in our province, immediately respond to this call, actively participate in the national movement to increase production and practice economy, and continue to conduct self-education and self-transformation in the work of participating in socialist construction, resolutely implement the general line of socialist construction, strive to make achievements, offer gifts to the Party, and welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great motherland!

Finally, we would also like to talk about a special issue, which is that just as the people of all ethnic groups in the country are under the leadership of the Party, full of confidence and courage, and striving to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group dared to collude with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to openly carry out armed rebellion, betray the motherland, undermine unity, and undermine ethnic solidarity. Now, they have suffered a shameful defeat, and the situation in Tibet is completely under the control of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region. The traitorous elements' fantasy of so-called "Tibetan independence" and their attempt to maintain their darkest and most brutal reactionary rule for a long time are absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country and will never be possible. The conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and Indian expansionists are all in vain and will never succeed. We fully support all the measures taken by the Central People's Government to completely quell the rebellion. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, the Tibetan people will surely move forward "by leaps and bounds," progress together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and develop together.

    在改造中要不折不扣地接受党的领导
    童少生　萧则可　黄鱼门　王文彬　萧松立代表的联合发言
    我们完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念两位副总理和彭真副委员长所作的各项报告，并决心在各个工作岗位上为完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划而努力！
    现在，请让我们就对大跃进的体会和四川省工商界自我改造情况作如下发言。
    一九五八年是我们国家全面大跃进的一年。我们四川省和全国各地一样，在各方面都取得了伟大的成就。粮食、棉花空前大丰收，钢铁成倍的增长，在党的“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针指导下，整个工农业生产、基本建设、交通运输、科学技术、文化教育、卫生等各方面都获得了空前的发展和提高。随着生产大跃进的发展和农民的迫切要求，农村实现了公社化。广大劳动人民群众破除迷信，解放思想，敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格和苦干、实干、巧干、相互协作的集体主义精神正在普遍的成长和壮大，人们的精神面貌焕然一新，物质生活和文化生活有了显著的提高。据我们到农村、工厂视察、参观、访问的所见所闻，无数生动的事实，日新月异的景象，真是没有一个地方不显示出飞跃的变化和发展，我们确是受到深刻的社会主义教育。这样鼓舞人心、飞跃发展的形势，使我们深深感到祖国的伟大和可爱，作为一个中华人民共和国公民，真是足以自豪。我们更衷心地信服只有在中国共产党的英明领导下，才能取得这样史无前例、震惊世界的大跃进的奇迹，并进一步的认识了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线，以及根据总路线所制定的一整套方针政策的无比伟大和正确。
    工商业者虽然有了不同程度的进步，但多数人还具有两面性
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，在振奋人心大跃进的形势和工农劳动人民冲天干劲的鼓舞和影响下，在中共四川省委和各级党委的正确领导下，我们四川省工商界，在受到整风运动教育的基础上，转入了生产劳动实践，一年多来，多数人的政治思想逐步地，不同程度地起了变化，向党靠拢了一步。但是我们工商界多数人由于政治立场的局限，对建设社会主义总路线和大跃进原来不是那么容易接受和正确认识的，甚至认为“多快就不能好省”，“跃进并不全面”，“大跃进太紧张了，吃不消”。对人民公社化东猜西疑，动荡不安。通过大跃进中出现的许许多多、振奋人心事实的教育，实践中自己的体会，以及不断的学习和讨论，才逐步认识到大跃进各方面的成就确是无比辉煌，短短的几个月内取得的成绩，都是过去不能设想也不敢想象的。随着人民公社的建立和巩固，生产力的巨大发展，人民生活的迅速改善，更为我们将来描绘出美好幸福的前景。只有这样才能改变我们祖国一穷二白的面貌，永远不受帝国主义侵凌。如果从六亿人民的利益，子孙万代的幸福出发，算一算这笔大账，确令人欢欣鼓舞，精神振奋，种种怀疑顾虑，无非是站在个人的圈子里打小算盘。同时，在这样大跃进形势下，党还特别照顾了我们，重申了定息政策七年不变，高工资不变，城市人民公社对我们也有所等待。对我们不少的工商业者家属，又给了工作安排，增加了收入。对我们存在的各种思想顾虑，不断耐心的给予教育帮助，这就更使我们工商业者深切地感到党对我们真是关怀备至，体贴入微，从而增强了我们走社会主义的信心和决心。大家深切地感到，无论从国家前途讲，从个人利益讲，都应当积极地作好岗位工作，为祖国增添一砖一瓦，贡献一得之见，一技之长，以尽到新中国公民应尽的责任，才能跟上时代的步伐，以报答党对我们的恩情。因而多数人都先后参加了大跃进的行列，不同程度地投入了技术革命和文化革命，不少人献技献策，提出合理化建议和技术革新的意见。这些建议和意见，部分被采用后，对于提高劳动生产率，节约原材料，提高服务质量以及解决企业关键问题等方面，都起到一定的作用。有些人还与职工一道编写了技术资料、商业知识、药物学等文件。有些人还与工人结合试制成功新产品，仅成都、重庆、自贡三市即制成四百多种，其中如金色罐头涂料、快色素印花染料、磺胺咪、味精、氯化锌、氰氟矽酸、丝安酸等品种还达到国内先进水平或赶上或超过资本主义国家的水平。省内不少地区的工商界响应“全民办工业”的号召，在当地党委的领导下，还办了各种小型工厂，如成都市的焊条厂、古宋县的炼铁厂等，从去年开办以来，不仅生产正常，业务发展，纳入国家计划，而且获得盈余，在政治思想改造上和培养技术能力上也都取得成绩。为了支援工农业生产，在劳动实践中更好改造自己，多数工商业者除参加本企业工作以外，还参加了力所能及的短期劳动。在生产劳动工作中做出成绩的，都受到了表扬和鼓励。从这些生产劳动实践中，使我们受到了生动的、现实的社会主义教育，实际体会到劳动光荣、剥削可耻的道理，认识到劳动人民具有无穷的智慧和高贵品质，从而在一定程度上克服了轻视劳动人民、保守思想、技术私有、迷信书本、迷信外国、重洋轻土、重业务轻政治等等错误思想和观点，在思想感情上开始缩短了与劳动人民的距离。上述情况说明我们四川工商业者，一年多来，在党的领导下，在为社会主义服务的工作中和自我改造的道路上，是有好的表现和不同程度的进步的。但这些进步，不等于说我们的政治立场和思想就改造好了，如在对党的领导问题上，不少人虽有敬佩感激的一面，但在具体问题上又东猜西疑，三心二意；在政治立场的根本改造问题上，大多数人在整风后虽然承认了要接受改造，但经过一段劳动实践之后，又出现了估计偏高的倾向，认为：“改造得差不多了”，在前进道路上还存在厌倦改造的情绪；在为社会主义服务工作中，由于政治立场还未解决，有些人干劲不足，安于中游，或时冷时热，时进时退，有的做出成绩就骄傲自满。这些情况表明，我们多数人还没有达到改变资本主义立场为社会主义立场的程度，没有达到摆脱两面性的程度，根据毛主席所指示的六项政治标准来衡量，显然还有不小的距离，因此，必须要继续加强政治立场、思想的根本改造。回顾我们所经历的自我改造过程，深切地认识到我们工商业者的根本改造是要经过反复、长期和艰巨的自我斗争过程的。我们只有下定决心不断提高自觉，加强改造，积极服务，坚决的听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，走社会主义的道路，才能完成向劳动人民的过渡，成为名副其实的光荣的劳动者。
    把改造与服务密切结合起来，为社会主义服务的过程，就是自我改造的过程
    一九五九年是我们国家建设社会主义更大、更好、更全面跃进的一年，国民经济计划无比宏伟，前途无限光明，全国劳动人民正斗志昂扬、意气风发地鼓足了冲天干劲，为实现这一伟大的计划而继续英勇奋斗。三个多月以来，各个战线上捷报频传，一个胜利接着一个胜利，更加鼓舞着全国人民信心百倍地奋勇前进。在这样一天等于二十年的伟大时代里，我们四川省工商业者在中共四川省委领导下，一定要奋起直追，紧紧地跟上劳动人民的步伐，踊跃地积极投身于建设社会主义的行列中去，认真搞好企业或岗位工作，围绕企业的中心任务，积极参加技术革命和文化革命，踊跃献计献策，努力做出成绩，并在实践中不断地“立中求破”加强自我改造。争取在政治思想上改造得大体上符合毛主席所指示的六项政治标准的人日渐增多，为我省工商界的进一步根本改造打下基础。
    我们体会到，要真正为社会主义服务，必须把改造与服务密切结合起来。我们资产阶级分子，长期以来是站在资本主义立场看问题，对于社会主义新事物的认识，是有阶级局限性的，如果不政治挂帅，重视自己的改造，对党的方针政策就不能正确理解，在具体工作中也不容易充分发挥积极性。同时，我们的资本主义立场、观点，在为社会主义服务的实践中，就会不断地反映出来，经过教育和帮助与自己的努力，使我们能够得到克服和解决。由此可见，为社会主义服务的过程，就是不断发扬积极性和不断克服消极性的过程，也是自我改造的过程。服务和改造是相辅相成，相互促进的。从我省工商界若干事实证明，凡是认识自我改造的必要性，努力加强自我改造的，在服务工作中，就做出了成绩，同时在积极服务过程中，又不断获得进步。因此，我们在实践中，必须要重视自己政治立场的改造，克服干劲不足、安居中游、时冷时热、时进时退等消极现象，才能真正为社会主义服务。
    在改造中，有的进步快，有的进步慢，关键在于是否能够真诚地接受党的领导，不要三心二意，而要一心一意地接受党的领导
    我们还进一步体会到，要加强政治立场的根本改造，最重要的是要做到一心一意、无条件地接受党的领导，真心诚意地拥护并贯彻执行党的各项方针政策。党是领导我们国家一切事业的核心力量，任何工作离开党的领导就必然一事无成。特别是我们工商业者，由于两条道路的问题还没有解决，要为社会主义服务，要把自己改造成为名副其实的劳动者，如果不紧紧地依靠党的领导，更是不可想象的事情。事实上，党根据和平改造政策，对我们工商界一贯是耐心教育和帮助的，希望我们不断进步，为社会主义建设贡献力量。但是在改造中，有的进步快，有的进步慢，关键在于是否能够真诚地接受党的领导。我省工商界有些同志能够靠拢党，认真学习党的方针政策，就比较容易接受党的帮助和教育，不断破除资本主义立场、观点，在自我改造上和服务工作中都获得较大的进步和成绩。因此，我们必须消除对党的三心二意，在思想上、行动上一心一意地接受党的领导，尤其具体的要服从党的基层组织的领导，才能在工作中做出成绩，更好的改造自己。
    周总理在政府工作报告中指出：今年全国人民的主要任务，就是积极努力，为完成和超额完成这个以四大指标为中心的国民经济计划而奋斗。我们一定遵照周总理的指示，和我省工商业者一起，立即响应这一号召，积极投入增产节约的全民运动，并在参加社会主义建设的工作中继续进行自我教育和自我改造，坚决贯彻社会主义建设总路线，努力做出成绩，向党献礼，迎接伟大祖国国庆十周年！
    最后，我们还要特别谈一个问题，就是正当全国各族人民在党的领导下，信心百倍、勇气十足，努力实现更大更好更全面跃进的时候，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，竟敢勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，公开进行武装叛乱，背叛祖国，破坏统一，破坏民族团结，现在，他们已经遭到可耻的失败，西藏局势已经完全在人民解放军西藏军区和西藏自治区筹备委员会的控制之下。叛国分子幻想所谓“西藏独立”，企图长期维持他们最黑暗、最残酷的反动统治，全国人民是绝对不能容忍的，也是万万做不到的。帝国主义和印度的扩张主义分子的阴谋诡计，都是枉费心机，永远也不可能得逞的。我们完全拥护中央人民政府彻底平息叛乱的一切措施。我们深信西藏人民在党的领导下一定能够“一日千里”地向前迈进，和全国各族人民一起进步，共同发展。
