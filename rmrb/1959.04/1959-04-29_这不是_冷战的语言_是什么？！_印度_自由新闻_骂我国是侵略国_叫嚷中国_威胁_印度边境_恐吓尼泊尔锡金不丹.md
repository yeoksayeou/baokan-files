Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 27th -- The "Free Press" published an article on the 26th, clamoring that China "threatens" the Indian border, attempting to divert people's attention from the Indian expansionists' interference in China's internal affairs.

The article used many phrases commonly used by imperialists to attack China, saying that "China has always been an expansionist country" and that China's political system is "aggressive and subversive." It also said that "China's emergence as a strong, unified country has strengthened its far-reaching influence on our (India's) northeastern border issues."

The article absurdly claimed that the rapid construction of Xinjiang threatens Kashmir.

This newspaper also maliciously attempted to provoke China's neighbors against China. It said that Nepal's "strategic interests are closely related to India's strategic interests. The situation in Tibet shows that for the security of these two countries, it is certainly necessary to formulate some kind of joint defense plan. India has been providing suggestions in engineering and military affairs, as well as providing assistance in economic aspects to help Nepal. In view of the political and strategic interests of the two countries, it is not difficult for them to formulate plans for a joint guard and patrol organization under a joint command."

The article also said, "It is our responsibility to defend Sikkim and Bhutan. These two regions are directly exposed to possible pressure from Lhasa," "but Bhutan needs some special attention. The first thing to note is the need to build some roads so that traffic from India to Bhutan can be smooth when it is in urgent need."

The article mentioned the Naga rebellion in eastern India and other tribal issues. It fabricated rumors and slandered "the Chinese attempt to establish contact with these tribes."

Although the article had to say that "China is not our enemy, and we have reason to believe that the Chinese do not regard us as their enemy either," the article nonsensically said, "China today holds a salvationist political ideology that tends to regard everyone outside the true believers as a potential object." The article also called on India to "be highly vigilant both on the border and at home, because freedom may be destroyed by aggression, as well as by subversion."

This article, under the guise of the so-called "China threat to India," exposed the ambitions of Indian expansionist elements.

    这不是“冷战的语言”是什么？！
    印度“自由新闻”骂我国是侵略国
    叫嚷中国“威胁”印度边境　恐吓尼泊尔锡金不丹
    新华社新德里27日电　“自由新闻”在26日发表文章，叫嚷说中国“威胁”印度边境，企图借此转移人们对印度扩张主义者干涉中国内政的注意。
    文章用了许多帝国主义者惯用的词句来攻击中国，说“中国一直是一个扩张主义国家”，中国的政治制度是“侵略性的，是颠覆性的”。它还说什么“中国以一个强大、统一的国家的姿态出现，已经加强了它对于我们（印度）东北边境问题的深远的影响”。
    文章胡说新疆的迅速建设威胁了克什米尔。
    这家报纸还恶毒地企图挑拨中国的邻国同中国的关系。它说，尼泊尔的“战略利益同印度的战略利益是息息相关的。西藏的局势说明，为了这两个国家的安全，当然有必要制订某种共同防御计划。印度一直在工程和军事方面提出建议以及在经济方面提供援助来帮助尼泊尔。鉴于两国的政治和战略利益，它们不难制订关于在一个联合司令部领导下的共同的警卫和巡逻机构的计划。”
    文章还说，“保卫锡金和不丹是我们的责任，这两个地区直接暴露在可能来自拉萨的压力的面前”，“但是不丹还需要一些特别的注意。首先需要注意的是需要修筑一些公路，以便在它有紧急需要时，从印度到不丹的交通可以畅通”。
  文章提到印度东部那加族叛乱问题以及其他一些部族的问题，它无中生有地造谣污蔑“中国人企图同这些部族建立接触”。
    虽然文章不得不说“中国不是我们的敌人，我们有理由相信，中国人也不把我们看成是他们的敌人”。然而，文章瞎说，“中国今天抱着一种救世的政治思想，这种思想倾向于把真正信徒以外的每一个人看成是潜在的对象”。文章还号召印度“十分必要在边境和国内都提高警惕，因为自由可能被侵略所破坏，同样地也可能为颠覆活动所破坏”。
    这篇文章在所谓“中国威胁印度”的幌子下，暴露了印度扩张主义分子的野心。
