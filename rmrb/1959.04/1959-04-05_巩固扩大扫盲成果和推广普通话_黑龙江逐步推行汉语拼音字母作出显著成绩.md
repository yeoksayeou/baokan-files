    To consolidate and expand the achievements of illiteracy eradication and promote Mandarin Chinese
    Heilongjiang Gradually Implements the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet with Remarkable Results

    (Our dispatch) Heilongjiang Province has made significant progress in promoting the phonetic alphabet and Mandarin Chinese in recent years. In particular, since the second half of 1958, many counties and cities have begun to promote it among the broad masses of workers and peasants. The use of the phonetic alphabet has not only consolidated and expanded the achievements of illiteracy eradication but has also helped promote Mandarin Chinese. Baitan and Tonghe counties have achieved particularly outstanding results.

    In order to promote the use of the phonetic alphabet, consolidate and expand the achievements of illiteracy eradication, promote the experience of Mandarin, and determine future tasks, the Heilongjiang Provincial Mandarin Promotion Committee, the Provincial Department of Education, and the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League recently jointly held an on-site conference in Baiquan County. Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, was very concerned about this on-site conference and sent a congratulatory telegram, putting forward important opinions on the use of the phonetic alphabet by workers and peasants to consolidate and expand the achievements of illiteracy eradication, and on the promotion of Mandarin in schools. The congratulatory telegram stated: "Based on what I have seen in several provinces and cities in the north, I believe that the promotion of the phonetic alphabet among workers and peasants in the northern dialect area should first and foremost be used to consolidate and expand the achievements of illiteracy eradication, which will also be combined with the promotion of Mandarin."

   The achievements of Heilongjiang Province in promoting the phonetic alphabet and Mandarin in recent years are: primary and secondary schools and normal schools have basically completed the task of promoting the phonetic alphabet, and the trend of speaking Mandarin is gradually taking shape. Since the promotion to the broad masses of workers and peasants began in the second half of 1958, by February of this year, more than 700,000 workers and peasants across the province have participated in learning, and more than ten counties and cities, including Baiquan, Tonghe, Mudanjiang, and Kedong, have formed mass learning movements. In many places, after learning the phonetic alphabet, workers and peasants not only use it as a crutch to consolidate and expand the achievements of illiteracy eradication, but also eliminate many remaining illiterate people. According to statistics from Baiquan County alone, more than 2,500 people have been eliminated from illiteracy. More than 6,500 people have consolidated and improved their literacy skills. Wang Hongxia, a female commune member of the Minzhong Management Area of the Fengchan People's Commune in Baiquan County, was completely illiterate before learning the phonetic alphabet. She learned the phonetic alphabet in only thirteen hours, and then used it as a crutch. By the beginning of March this year, she had learned more than 1,300 Chinese characters in seventeen days, approaching the level of literacy graduation. Another female commune member, Chai Shuqin, graduated from illiteracy eradication in the spring of 1957. Later, due to illness, she was unable to continue learning, and by the first half of 1958, she had regressed by more than 600 characters. She learned the phonetic alphabet in only five or six hours, and now she has not only returned to the level of literacy graduation, but has also learned more than 1,000 more characters.

    The phonetic alphabet has also shown its effectiveness in literacy teaching in the lower grades of primary schools. Wu Songzhen, a first-grade student at Santongzhen Primary School in Baiquan County, is only nine years old this year. She can not only spell words and sentences quite proficiently, but also, with the help of the phonetic alphabet, learned all the new words in the second-grade language textbook in more than twenty days after the start of school this year.

    Many facts have proven that learning the phonetic alphabet can lead to a faster mastery of Mandarin. When the Fenmi Factory in Baiquan County began promoting Mandarin among its employees, it did not teach the phonetic alphabet. As a result, after less than three days of learning, the employees reflected: "Mandarin is good, but it's hard to learn and hard to remember, and if you forget it, you have nothing to grab onto." They immediately taught the phonetic alphabet, which was welcomed by the employees. The commune members of the Minzhong Management Area of the Fengchan People's Commune were able to distinguish the differences between their own or others' pronunciation and Beijing pronunciation because they had mastered the phonetic "crutch," and they were able to practice repeatedly using phonetic reading materials, gradually forming the habit of speaking Mandarin. At present, Heilongjiang Province is using the phonetic alphabet to consolidate and expand the achievements of illiteracy eradication and to push the promotion of Mandarin to a new upsurge.

    巩固扩大扫盲成果和推广普通话
    黑龙江逐步推行汉语拼音字母作出显著成绩
    本报讯　黑龙江省推行拼音字母和推广普通话的工作，几年来已经取得了显著的成绩，特别是从1958年下半年以来，许多县、市已经开始在广大工农群众中推行。利用拼音字母不仅巩固扩大了扫盲成果，也帮助了普通话的推广，拜泉、通河两县的成绩更是突出。
    为了推广利用拼音字母、巩固扩大扫盲成果和推广普通话的经验，并确定今后的工作任务，黑龙江省推广普通话工作委员会、省教育厅和共青团省委最近联合在拜泉县召开了现场会议。中国文字改革委员会吴玉章主任十分关心这次现场会议，特为发了贺电，对工农群众利用拼音字母巩固扩大扫盲成果和学校的推广普通话工作提出了重要的意见。贺电中说：“根据我在北方几个省市看到的情况，我认为在北方话区工农群众中推行拼音字母，首先和主要应该用来巩固和扩大扫盲成果，这样同时也就结合了推广普通话。”
   黑龙江省几年来推行拼音字母和推广普通话的成绩是：中、小学和师范学校已经基本上完成了推行拼音字母的任务，说普通话的风气正在逐渐形成。从1958年下半年开始向广大工农群众中推行以来，到今年2月为止，全省投入学习的工农青年已达七十多万人，已经有拜泉、通河、牡丹江、克东等十多个县、市形成了群众性的学习运动。很多地方的工农群众在学会了拼音字母以后，不仅利用它当拐棍巩固扩大了扫盲成果，而且扫除了许多剩余文盲。仅拜泉一县的统计，就扫除了二千五百多人。巩固提高的有六千五百多人。拜泉县丰产人民公社民众管理区女社员王洪霞，未学拼音字母以前是一个一字不识的纯文盲。她仅用十三个小时就学会了拼音字母，然后用它做拐棍，到今年3月初用了十七天的时间就学会了一千三百多个汉字，接近了扫盲毕业水平。另一个女社员柴淑琴是1957年春扫盲毕业的，后来因病没能坚持学习，到1958年上半年就回生了六百多字，她只用了五、六小时就学会了拼音字母，现在不仅恢复到了扫盲毕业水平，又多学了一千多个字。
    拼音字母在小学低年级的识字教学中也显示了它的作用。拜泉县三通镇小学一年级学生吴颂珍，今年才九岁，她不但能相当熟练地拼写词句，而且借助拼音字母，在今年开学后二十多天的时间里，就把第二册语文的全部生字学会了。
    许多事实证明，学习了拼音字母就能较快地学好普通话。拜泉县粉米厂在职工中开始推广普通话的时候，没有教拼音字母，结果学习不到三天，职工们反映：“普通话好是好，就是好学不好记，忘了没抓手。”他们马上又教了拼音字母，受到职工的欢迎。丰产人民公社民众管理区的社员们，就是因为掌握了正音拐棍，才能够分辨出自己或别人的语音和北京语音的差别，并能利用注音读物反复进行练习，逐步形成了说普通话的习惯。目前，黑龙江省各地正在利用拼音字母，来巩固扩大扫盲成果和把推广普通话的工作推向新的高潮。
