    "New Construction" magazine published an article in its April issue written by He Ziquan titled "How to Evaluate Qin Shi Huang." The author agrees with Guo Moruo's opinion in "Rehabilitating Cao Cao" regarding rehabilitating Qin politics. He states, "Depicting Qin Shi Huang as a tyrant, and the most cruel tyrant, does not align with Qin Shi Huang's true face." He believes that "Qin's unification was in line with the objective historical development requirements of the time" and "From the perspective of major principles, whether considering the people of that time or the development of the entire nation, Qin Shi Huang made great contributions."
    He says that since the late Spring and Autumn period, due to the use of iron tools, productivity had greatly developed. With the development of agriculture, handicrafts, commerce, and the urban economy also developed. The increasingly close economic relations between regions constituted the material basis for the demand for political unification. Qin Shi Huang's unification fulfilled this requirement. Moreover, Qin Shi Huang also expanded the territory to the south, establishing the Guilin, Xiang, and Nanhai commanderies, which not only expanded the territory of this unified country but also played a role in promoting the culture of these regions. At that time, the Qin Empire was the largest unified country in the world. To consolidate unification, Qin Shi Huang unified the national writing system, currency, and weights and measures, which was of great importance to the formation of the Han nationality.
    Regarding the burning of books and burying of scholars and the enslavement of the people, the author believes it should be viewed as follows: Burning books was not good. However, what Qin Shi Huang's burning of books reflected was the attack of those politically representing progress against those representing reaction, a means to prohibit the reactionary thought of "praising the past and criticizing the present." To ban reactionary thought, ancient documents were burned, and although the method was crude, it had progressive significance. Furthermore, not all poetry and books were burned; the central doctoral officials still kept these books in the government. The burying of scholars was a continuation of the burning of books incident. The four hundred and sixty people who were buried were mainly those who "spread rumors to confuse the masses." This is incomparable in cruelty to the case of Emperor Wu of Han's persecution of the followers of Liu An, the Prince of Huainan, where tens of thousands died. Qin Shi Huang's excessive use of the people's labor, which caused many families to be torn apart, was naturally not good, but from a major perspective, building the Great Wall and attacking the Xiongnu had positive significance at the time and was in line with the interests of the people at that time. The author believes that Qin Shi Huang made great contributions to the development of Chinese history and should be given his due place in history, but his negative aspect of excessively exploiting the people cannot be erased.

    怎样评价秦始皇
      “新建设”杂志4月号发表了何兹全写的“怎样评价秦始皇”一文。作者同意郭沫若在“替曹操翻案”中提及的为秦政翻案的意见。他说，“把秦始皇描绘为暴君，而且是最残酷的暴君，和秦始皇的真实面貌是不符合的”。他认为“秦的统一是符合当时历史客观发展的要求的”“从大节方面来看，无论就对当时的人民说，还是对整个的民族发展说，秦始皇都是有很大贡献的”。
    他说，春秋后期以来，由于铁制工具的使用，生产力有了很大发展，随着农业的发展，手工业、商业、城市经济也跟着发展起来，各地区日益密切的经济关系，构成要求政治上统一的物质基础。秦始皇的统一，实现了这个要求。而且，秦始皇还南拓疆土，建立桂林、象和南海三郡，不仅扩大了这个统一国家的领土，对这些地区的文化还起了推动作用。当时，秦帝国是世界上最大的统一的国家，为了巩固统一，秦始皇统一全国的文字、货币和度量衡，这对于汉民族的形成有着很大的关系。
    关于焚书坑儒和奴役人民两事，作者认为应该这样来看：焚书，是不好的；但秦始皇焚书所体现的是在政治上代表进步的人对代表反动的人的打击，是禁止“是古非今”的反动思想的手段，为了禁止反动思想而焚掉古代文献，手段是粗暴了些，但它却是有进步意义的。而且也不是把所有的诗书全部烧掉，中央博士官府仍藏有这些书。坑儒是焚书事件的延续。所坑杀的四百六十人主要仍是那些“为訞言以乱黔首”的人。这比起汉武帝治淮南王刘安党狱与死者数万人来，其残酷不可同日而语。秦始皇过分地役使民力，使很多人妻离子散，自然是不好的，但从大节上看，修长城、击匈奴，在当时具有积极意义，是符合当时人民的利益的。作者认为秦始皇对中国历史发展有很大的贡献，在历史上要给他应有的地位，但对他的过分役使人民的坏的一面也是不能勾销的。
