　　"Seize the Three Spring Months to Eliminate Rats and Sparrows"
　　Lü Liequan
    More than twenty years ago, when I was in elementary school in Beijing, I happened to go out of Andingmen to play in March. I saw red paper strips posted on the trees, with the words "Please do not shoot birds in March" written on them. At the time, I didn't understand what it meant, so I asked an elder. I learned that March is the peak breeding season for birds. At that time, so-called "benevolent people" were very concerned about birds, fearing that killing the mother would harm the offspring. Therefore, they advised people not to shoot birds in March. This was considered a great compassion for birds. However, what would those who made a living by shooting birds eat if they didn't shoot birds, driven by the need for food and clothing?
    In fact, such things were not new in the old society. The social system determined people's moral concepts.
    With the transformation of the social system, people's moral concepts have also changed. In today's society, everything is considered from the perspective of human happiness. Not only is the act of "buying birds for release" no longer seen, but even the saying "Please do not shoot birds in March" may not have been heard by young people.
    Of course, now we don't completely oppose advising people not to shoot birds, because birds are not all the same. There are birds that are harmful to humans, and there are birds that are beneficial to humans; there are ordinary birds, and there are relatively rare and precious birds. We cannot generalize. However, for a pest bird like the sparrow, which lives by pecking at grains and ruins crops, and is listed as one of the "Four Pests," it is indeed a great opportunity to vigorously hunt and kill them in the spring months to eliminate the sparrow plague. Spring is the season when all things are created and grow. Not only are birds vigorously breeding at this time, but so are sparrows and rats. It seems that the saying "Please do not shoot birds in March" would be more timely and reasonable if it were changed to "Seize the Three Spring Months to Eliminate Rats and Sparrows."

　　“抓紧三春灭鼠雀”
　　吕冽泉
    二十多年以前，我在北京上小学，有一次正赶三月里出安定门去玩，看见树上贴着红纸条，上面写着“劝君莫打三月鸟”。当时不明白是什么意思，请教长者，才知道三月是禽鸟繁殖的盛期，那时候所谓“善人”们，对鸟非常关怀，恐怕杀其母而害及其子，因此劝谕人们不要在三月打鸟。这对禽鸟来说，也算是大加体悯了，然而，被衣食所迫以打鸟为生的人，不打鸟吃什么呢？
    其实在旧社会，这样的事并不新鲜。社会制度决定着人们的道德观念。
    随着社会制度的变革，人们的道德观念也改变了。在今天的社会里，一切都是从人类的幸福着想，不光“买鸟放生”的事看不见了，就是连“劝君莫打三月鸟”这样的话，青、少年们也未必听见说过。
    当然，现在我们也不完全反对劝人别打鸟，因为鸟也不一样，有对人类有害的鸟，也有对人类有益的鸟；有一般的鸟，也有比较珍异的鸟，不能一概而论。不过，要像麻雀那样，以啄食五谷为生、糟塌粮食为能被列为“四害”之一的害鸟，要趁阳春三月大力捕杀，倒的的确确是消灭雀害的大好时机。春天是万物化生的季节，不光禽鸟在这时候繁殖旺盛，麻雀如此，老鼠也是这样。看来，“劝君莫打三月鸟”这句话，改成“抓紧三春灭鼠雀”就比较适时而且合理了。
