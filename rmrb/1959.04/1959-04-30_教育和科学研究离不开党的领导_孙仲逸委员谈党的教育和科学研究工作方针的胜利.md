Fellow committee members:

I am honored to attend the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and to be present at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress. I feel extremely excited. Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report at the Political Consultative Conference and Premier Zhou's government work report at the National People's Congress have given me great encouragement and direction for my efforts. Under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country has undergone a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in a short period, changing its old backward face and making great strides forward. This is a Great Leap Forward unprecedented in Chinese and foreign history. Simultaneously with the nationwide Great Leap Forward last year, the Party and the government issued the great call for a cultural revolution and a technological revolution. Since then, education and scientific research work across the country have seen rapid leaps forward, powerfully demonstrating the great victory of the Party and government's education policy and leadership in scientific work. The achievements in this area are too numerous to mention. Now, I would like to briefly mention one or two based on my personal experience.

The Party and the government put forward the educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. As a result, schools across the country, especially universities, have launched work-study programs and sent teachers and students to factories and farms to engage in labor training. At the time, I thought that sweeping away thousands of years of accumulated ills required this; only by thoroughly destroying the old could we establish the new. However, the remnants of the bourgeois educational viewpoint from the old society had not been completely eradicated from my mind, and I could not clearly see the future achievements of the new measures, even doubting that they might lower the quality of teaching. Facts have proved that this worry was completely unnecessary and even wrong. In less than half a year, our Guangxi Agricultural College, through vigorously running factories, engaging in farming, and reforming teaching, took on a completely new look. Students and some teachers initially established a labor viewpoint and were able to link theory with practice. Last November, students in the second, third, and fourth grades, along with the majority of teachers, were further sent down to five typical people's communes in five special districts for training. In the six months since, they have undergone arduous training, strengthened their labor viewpoint, established a flesh-and-blood connection with the peasants, and gained a complete set of practical production knowledge, consolidating and enriching their theoretical knowledge. They understood the importance of their chosen profession for building socialism, thus changing their old viewpoint of doubting and belittling agricultural studies and greatly consolidating their professional ideology. Some of them said that mastering biological production is indeed not a simple matter. At the same time, they also participated in the work of rectifying the people's communes, conducted scientific research with the commune members, summarized the experience of high yields of major crops in 1958, and helped the commune formulate a comprehensive production plan for this year. Their performance was widely praised by the commune members, the commune Party committee, the county Party committee, and the district Party committee. Earlier this month, I visited them at the Liangpa Red Flag People's Commune in Baise and saw that they had a deep understanding of the superiority of the people's commune and the problems encountered in its development, and that they had basically mastered the laws of agricultural production and were able to fight against nature. They were also better able to integrate and apply their theoretical knowledge. This powerfully demonstrates that combining education with productive labor does not lower the quality of teaching but greatly improves it. I then deeply realized the greatness and correctness of the Party's education policy. Combining education with productive labor and linking theory with practice not only cultivates new communist people but also enables schools to increasingly develop into new types of schools. On the basis of the victory of this educational policy, Premier Zhou emphasized in his report that in full-time regular schools at all levels, improving the quality of teaching should be taken as a regular and fundamental task, and that greater efforts should first be concentrated on running a number of key schools well, in order to cultivate specialized talents of higher quality for the country and rapidly promote the improvement of our country's scientific and cultural level. This makes me feel even more that we educators in universities have a clearer direction and a greater responsibility.

The Party proposed that scientific research must be driven by tasks, that scientific research work must have the absolute leadership of the Party, and that it must follow the mass line. The vast majority of our scientific workers listen to the Party. However, when we first received instructions, we only had a general concept and did not have a deep understanding. In the past, our college put forward a large number of scientific research topics every year, most of which started from personal interests and were controlled by a few people, without knowing how to rely on the leadership of the Party and the joint efforts of the masses. As a result, half of the topics each year were not completed well or could not be completed due to subjective or objective reasons, let alone keeping up with the requirements of the production situation. Since the Party put forward the guiding principles and lines for scientific research, agricultural scientific research work, like other scientific research work, has paid attention to outstanding production problems. It can be said that agricultural scientific research can be carried out around the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. For example, deep plowing and soil improvement, planting density, lodging prevention, full pregnancy of livestock, etc., are all urgent problems in current agricultural production that need to be solved, and agricultural scientific research experiment institutes, stations, and agricultural colleges in various parts of the country are conducting experimental research. At the same time, people's communes in various places are also conducting research in the same way, and many have achieved significant results, guiding production. For example, the problem of close planting of rice is being studied throughout the country, and suitable densities have been obtained everywhere. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region summarized the research results and designated the planting density for early rice, adopting specifications of 6×2 and 6×3. Reliable results were obtained in less than a year, guiding production. In the past, it would have taken several years, and the scope of application would not have been wide. As far as our college is concerned, last year, relying on the leadership of the Party and carrying forward the style of the mass line, in addition to the topics listed in the plan, the masses also had some creations and inventions, such as paint workers making high-quality activated carbon, etc. The teachers and students sent down to the people's communes also wrote more than 300 special papers. Last autumn, during the high-yield wheat trial and this spring's rice lodging prevention trial, 100 to 200 laborers were invested every day from land preparation, fertilization, sowing, and transplanting, and all were completed in three days. Without the concern and support of the Party committee, this would have been unimaginable.

The above-mentioned experiences show that my thinking has developed to a certain extent. This time, participating in the conference and group discussions, I have received even greater education and encouragement. I must muster enough energy, rely on the leadership of the Party committee and the cooperation of the masses, and take the initiative to do all my work well, first of all to do a good job in teaching and scientific research. We must also continue to work hard, transform ourselves, eradicate the remnants of bourgeois ideology, and establish a proletarian stand and viewpoint. With politics in command, we will steadily complete and fulfill the tasks and responsibilities we shoulder and contribute our life's energy to socialist construction.

    教育和科学研究离不开党的领导
    孙仲逸委员谈党的教育和科学研究工作方针的胜利各位委员：
    我这次荣幸地出席中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次全体会议并得同时列席第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，感到无比的兴奋。李维汉副主席在政治协商会议上的工作报告和周总理在人民代表大会上的政府工作报告，给我极大的鼓舞和努力的方向。我国在中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确领导下，短短的时期内，全面大跃进，改变了旧的落后面貌，并且大踏步地向前迈进，这是中外历史上所未有的大跃进。在去年全国各方面大跃进的同时，党和政府提出文化革命和技术革命的伟大号召。之后，全国教育工作和科学研究工作都有了飞速的跃进，有力地说明了党和政府教育方针和科学工作领导的伟大胜利。关于这方面的成就是不胜枚举的。现在拟就我亲自体会的略举一、二。
    党和政府提出了教育为工人阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针。于是，全国学校，特别是高等学校，展开勤工俭学和下放师生到工厂、农场，进行劳动锻炼。当时我以为扫除数千年的积弊，必须这样做，大破才能大立。但是，旧社会中资产阶级教育的观点残余在我尚未驱除净尽，对于新措施将来的成绩不能看得很清楚，甚至怀疑可能因此降低了教学质量。事实证明，这种顾虑是完全不必要的，而且是错误的。不到半年，我们广西农学院，在大办工厂，大搞农场和教学改革中，面貌焕然一新。学生及部分教师初步树立了劳动观点，并能理论联系实际。去年十一月，二、三、四年级学生及绝大部分教师又进一步下放到五个专区五个典型人民公社，进行锻炼。迄今六个月来，他们经过了刻苦锻炼，坚定了劳动观点，建立了与农民血肉相连的感情，并得到了整套生产实际知识，巩固和充实了理论知识。他们明白了所学专业对于建设社会主义的重要性，于是改变了一向怀疑轻视学农的旧观点，大大地巩固了专业思想。他们有的曾说道，掌握生物生产，的确不是单纯易举的事。同时，他们还参加了整顿人民公社的工作，和社员一道展开各项科学研究，总结一九五八年主要作物丰产经验，并帮助公社拟订今年的生产全面规划。他们的表现得到社员、社党委、县委以及地委的普遍赞扬。本月上旬我到百色两琶红旗人民公社探望他们，看到他们深刻地了解人民公社的优越性和发展中遇到的问题，并基本掌握了农业生产规律，能以和自然作斗争。对于理论知识学习亦更能融会贯通。这就有力地说明了，教育结合劳动生产，教学质量不是降低而是大大地提高了。我于是深深地体会到，党的教育方针的伟大与正确。教育与生产劳动相结合，理论与实际相联系，既培养了共产主义新人，又使学校日益发展成为新型的学校。在这样教育方针的胜利基础上，周总理在报告里又着重地指出，在各级全日制的正规学校中，应当把提高教学质量作为一个经常的基本任务，而且应当首先集中较大力量办好一批重点学校，以便为国家培养更高质量的专门人材，迅速促进我国科学文化水平的提高。这就使我更感到，我们高等学校教育工作者有了更明显的方向，责任也更加重大了。
    党对科学研究提出必须以任务带动学科，科学研究工作必须有党的绝对领导，必须走群众路线。我们绝大多数的科学工作者是听党的话的。但是，初接受指示时，亦还只是有一般的概念而体会的不深。往昔我们学院年年提出大量的科学研究课题，多数是从个人兴趣出发，而且掌握在少数人手中，不知道依靠党的领导和群众的共同努力。结果，每年课题中有半数因主观或客观原因完成得不好或不能完成，更谈不上跟上生产形势的要求。自从党提出科学研究的方针路线后，农业科学研究工作，亦如其他科学研究工作，重视到生产突出问题。也可以说，能围绕着农业“八字宪法”进行农业科学研究。例如深耕改土，播种密度，倒伏防止，家畜满怀等等，都是当前农业生产上迫切须待解决的问题，全国各地农业科学研究试验所、站以及高等农业院校都在予以试验研究。同时各地人民公社亦多同样地进行研究，并多获得了显著的成果，指导了生产。好像水稻密植问题，全国都在研究，各地都已得出适宜的密度。广西僮族自治区总结研究结果，指定早稻插植密度，采用6×2和6×3的规格。为时不到一年即得出可靠的结果，指导生产。若在往昔，就非费时数年不可，而且应用的范围不广。以我们学院而言，去年科学研究工作，依靠党的领导，发扬群众路线作风，除计划所列的课题多有成果外，群众亦有些创造发明，如油漆工人制成质地优良的活性炭等等，下放到人民公社的师生还写出专题论文三百多篇。去秋进行小麦丰产试验及今春水稻倒伏防止试验，从整地、施肥、播种和插秧，每日投入一百至二百个劳动力，三日之间全部完成。若无党委的关怀与支持，这是难以想像的。
    以上所述的体会说明，我的思想有了一定的开展。这次参加大会和小组讨论，我所得到的教育和鼓舞更大。我一定要鼓足干劲，依靠党委的领导和群众的协作，主动做好一切工作，首先要做好教学工作和科学研究工作。更要继续努力，自我改造，铲除资产阶级思想残余，树立无产阶级立场观点。以政治为统帅，踏实地完成和尽到自己所担负的任务和责任，为社会主义建设而贡献出毕生的精力。
