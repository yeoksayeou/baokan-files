    Promote the No. 2 Simplified Coke Oven
    This Coke Oven Has Four Major Advantages: Fast Construction, Low Investment, Good Product Quality, and High Coking Rate
    (Our report) The No. 2 simplified coke oven indeed has the advantages of fast construction, low investment, good product quality, and high coking rate. This has been fully proven by the recent construction of two No. 2 simplified coke ovens by the Tuxiangzhuang Coking Plant and the Coking Branch of the Mechanical Power Plant in Shijiazhuang City, from the construction process and production practice.
    The two No. 2 simplified coke ovens of the Tuxiangzhuang Coking Plant and the Coking Branch of the Mechanical Power Plant started construction in mid-February and were completed and put into production at the end of March and the beginning of April, respectively, producing high-quality coke. According to calculations, from the start of construction to the start of production, these two coke ovens only took about a month in actual time, excluding the time delayed due to waiting for building materials and production preparations. At present, the production of these two coke ovens is normal, the furnace temperature is above 1,100 degrees Celsius, and the coking time has been shortened to 17 to 20 hours. The coke produced is silver-gray, the coke blocks are uniform, and the strength, ash content, and sulfur content are basically the same as the coke produced by large coke ovens.
    The Hebei Provincial Metallurgical Bureau recently held an on-site meeting in Shijiazhuang to comprehensively summarize and promote the experiences of the Tuxiangzhuang Coking Plant and the Coking Branch of the Mechanical Power Plant in the construction of the No. 2 simplified coke oven, furnace baking, and production operations. The representatives from various places in Hebei who participated in the meeting visited and studied these two coke ovens, and their confidence was greatly increased. They expressed that they would seize the opportunity and speed up the construction of the No. 2 simplified coke oven.
    In addition, the Coking Branch of the Mechanical Power Plant in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, recently jointly built a No. 2 simplified coke oven with a brick-built gas collection pipe with the Anshan Coking and Refractory Materials Design Institute. After production testing, the effect was good. At present, the operation of this coke oven is normal, the furnace temperature reaches above 1,100 degrees Celsius, the coke quality is very good, and the tar recovery rate reaches about 4%. This brick-built gas collection pipe has been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, which believes that it is a successful experience and decided to promote it nationwide.
    The gas collection pipe built with bricks by the Coking Branch of the Mechanical Power Plant in Shijiazhuang City this time has been greatly improved. It changed the original method of closing the gas with baffles and instead used cast iron valves to close the gas. This brick-built gas collection pipe also has other advantages: it is easier to construct and operate than steel plate gas collection pipes, and each furnace can also save about 500 kilograms of steel plate. At the same time, it overcomes the shortcomings of gas leaking back into the furnace.

    推广二号简易焦炉
    这种焦炉有四大优点：建炉快、投资省、产品质量好、结焦率高
    本报讯　二号简易焦炉确实具有建炉快、投资省、产品质量好、结焦率高的优点。这是石家庄市的土贤庄炼焦厂和机械动力厂炼焦分厂最近新建成的两座二号简易焦炉，从建设过程和生产实践中充分证明了的。
    土贤庄炼焦厂和机械动力厂炼焦分厂的两座二号简易炼焦炉，是2月中旬先后开始动工兴建的，已经分别在3月底和4月上旬建成和投入生产，生产出了优等质量的焦炭。据计算，这两座焦炉从开始建炉到投入生产，扣除因为等待建筑材料和生产准备等原因所耽误的时间，实际上只用了大约一个月。目前这两座焦炉的生产都很正常，炉温在摄氏一千一百度以上，结焦时间已缩短到十七到二十小时。生产出来的焦炭为银灰色，焦块均匀，强度、灰分和硫分，基本上和大型焦炉生产出来的焦炭一样。
    河北省冶金局最近在石家庄召开了一次现场会议，全面总结和推广了土贤庄炼焦厂和机械动力厂炼焦分厂在建设二号简易炼焦炉和烘炉、生产操作等方面的经验。河北各地参加这次会议的代表，对这两座焦炉进行了观摩、学习后，信心倍增，纷纷表示要抓紧时机，加快建设二号简易焦炉。
    又讯　河北省石家庄市机械动力厂炼焦分厂最近和鞍山焦化耐火材料设计院共同试建了一座用砖砌筑集气管的二号简易焦炉。经过生产考验，效果良好。目前这座焦炉操作很正常，炉温达一千一百度以上，焦炭质量很好，焦油回收率达4％左右。这种砖砌集气管，经过冶金工业部审定，认为是一个成功的经验，决定向全国推广。
    石家庄市机械动力厂炼焦分厂这次用砖砌筑的集气管，作了很大改进。它改变了原来用插板关闭煤气的方法，改用铸铁作的阀来关住煤气，这种砖砌集气管还具有其他优点：比钢板制造的集气管容易施工，也容易操作，每座炉子还可以节省五百公斤左右的钢板。同时，克服了煤气向炉内倒漏的缺点。
