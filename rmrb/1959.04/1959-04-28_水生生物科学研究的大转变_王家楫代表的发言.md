The Great Shift in Aquatic Biology Research
Speech by Representative Wang Jiaji

Fellow Representatives:
I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state final accounts for 1958 and the draft state budget for 1959, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. These four reports further illuminate the bright path of accelerating the socialist construction of our motherland, point out the direction for the further efforts of all Chinese people in the future, and greatly strengthen our confidence and courage. We must, on the basis of the great victory of 1958, realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. In 1958, along with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, scientific research also achieved rapid development. Many unprecedented leap forward achievements were made throughout the country. The leap forward in scientific work is not accidental. Only through a series of movements such as rectification, anti-rightist struggle, and the uprooting of white flags and planting of red flags, after carrying out the struggle between two roads and two methods, solving the problem of the Party's absolute leadership over scientific research, and breaking the erroneous idea that scientific research cannot follow the mass line, can scientific work correctly move towards the socialist road and truly serve socialist construction. Now I will give a brief report to the representatives on the situation of the Institute of Hydrobiology before and after the rectification, which I am most familiar with.

In the past, aquatic biology research was divorced from production and reality, and was cold and deserted. After the rectification, it was connected with production and reality, and the work underwent a fundamental change.

The Institute of Hydrobiology is one of the oldest institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Including the years before liberation, it has a long history of thirty years. A long history, on the one hand, means that there is an old foundation; but on the other hand, because it is an old institute, from my own perspective, a set of old ideas, old views, and old styles have been left behind. The prominent manifestations are blind faith in authority, blind faith in foreign books, and blind faith in dogma, almost without exception. Most of the researchers, especially the old scientists, were detached from politics, not only being specialized but not red themselves, but also hoping that young people would follow the path of more specialized and less red. They believed that work connected with practice was theoretically weak, which made research work detached from practice for a long time. In order to pursue blind theory, they even adopted a negative, indifferent, or even rejecting attitude towards major projects related to the national economy, such as the study of the impact of the Three Gorges Dam on the spawning grounds of the Yangtze River, the artificial control of spawning of grass carp, silver carp, and bighead carp, and the summary of China's freshwater fish farming experience. They emphasized that scientific research requires a quiet environment, so they closed their doors and engaged in things that the working people could not understand in the ivory tower. As a result of being divorced from production and divorced from reality, they were also seriously divorced from the masses, making the Institute of Hydrobiology a "cold and deserted scientific yamen."

After liberation, especially after the establishment of the Party's comprehensive leadership over the institute, the thinking of all the staff was greatly liberated through the rectification. Old scientists criticized conservative ideas, and young people broke superstitions, went all out, and promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. On the basis of the combination of old and young and democratic unity, the great leap forward in research work was vigorously promoted. Since July 1, 1958, the day to celebrate the Party's birthday, young comrades have been working day and night with great enthusiasm. In just six months of continuous hard work, they presented gifts to the Party twice on October 1st and New Year's Day in 1959, with a total of twenty-six projects. Among them, such as the successful spawning and hatching of carp in winter under the climatic conditions of Central China, broke the seasonal limitation of carp spawning, and opened up a broad road for the production of fish fry in all seasons under artificial control. Another example is the research on nitrogen-fixing blue algae. Among the four species that have been found, the nitrogen fixation amount of one of them has exceeded that of Japan, which is the highest level in the world, thus providing a "ten thousand year fertilizer" supply path for paddy fields. Furthermore, the cultivation of chlorella and scenedesmus, which have high nutritional value, has not only significantly exceeded the existing international highest level in terms of yield, but also found high-yielding varieties and cultivation methods that can be cultivated in all seasons. Moreover, fish body immunity is rarely done at home or abroad; but in the great leap forward, the preliminary results have been achieved by using the immunization method to control bacterial enteritis of grass carp, which is the most harmful to freshwater aquaculture in China. In 1959, in order to meet the urgent needs of current production, a comprehensive summary of China's freshwater fish farming experience has been launched, and projects such as artificial control of spawning of grass carp, silver carp, and bighead carp, fish feed, accelerating fish growth, expanding aquaculture objects, improving lake water fertility, and investigating aquatic resources in the Yangtze River are continuing. In short, after the rectification, the Institute of Hydrobiology has indeed taken advantage of the east wind of the national industrial and agricultural great leap forward and achieved a fundamental change. "Booming and lively" has begun to replace "cold and deserted," so that it can make achievements that could not have been imagined in the past.

The Party, which has mastered Marxism, is the "great expert" in the people's cause. All "small experts" can only play their role under the leadership, help and education of this "great expert."

The great change in the Institute of Hydrobiology has given me personally the most serious, profound, and vivid practical education. It has educated me that I must sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, and it has educated me that scientific research work must also give prominence to politics and must follow the mass line.

The core force leading all our undertakings is the Communist Party of China, and scientific research is no exception. Before the rectification, when I encountered business problems, although I also consulted with the comrades in charge of the Party branch, whenever the Party branch and a few old scientists had different opinions, I always adopted the opinions of the few old scientists and would not consider the opinions of the Party branch again. This deviated from the leadership of the Party and caused the work of the Institute of Hydrobiology to deviate from the correct research direction for more than eight years, bringing great losses to the work. The Party, which has mastered the theoretical weapon of Marxism-Leninism, is the helmsman for promoting all human endeavors and is the "great expert" recognized by the working people. The so-called "experts" of the rightists and the bourgeois scientists who consider themselves experts are, at best, a very small "small expert." "Small experts" can only play a relatively large role under the leadership, help, and education of "great experts." Since one has expertise, one should actively help the Party strengthen its leadership over business, combine one's work with production practice according to the Party's policies and guidelines, and should also constantly communicate with the Party, saying whatever one thinks and saying whatever one has, truly achieving openness and sincerity.

The objective situation is changing greatly every day, so we cannot be satisfied with the small changes in subjective thinking. Older scientific workers must rely on the leadership of the Party on the one hand, and rely on the help of the masses on the other hand.

Through more than a year of rectification movement, although we intellectuals have made progress to varying degrees, we cannot say that our political stance has been fundamentally resolved, and that there are no problems with our academic thinking. Giving prominence to politics is by no means an easy task. The objective situation is changing greatly every day. If subjective thinking only changes a little, it will be difficult to give prominence to or give good prominence to politics. Now I still have many friends who always talk with great interest when it comes to business, but still remain silent when they come into contact with ideas. It should be recognized that the past separation from politics, separation from production, and separation from reality is by no means an accidental error, but an inevitable result of having little or even no working-class world outlook in one's mind. Work is becoming more and more busy, and it is easy to develop a sense of weariness towards self-transformation. Transformation is for the leap forward in work. Through the practice of the leap forward in work, recognition and awareness will also be improved, that is to say, giving prominence to politics and getting on the horse in business, the two promote each other, promote each other, and unite each other.

The great leap forward in scientific research work in 1958 was inseparable from carrying out mass movements on a large scale. But it is obvious that only after the Party has grasped absolute leadership can it truly embark on the mass line, especially in scientific, cultural, and educational institutions. Through the great achievements of mass movements and leap forward, scientists have begun to realize that the masses do have infinite wisdom and strength, and that their own knowledge and skills are really limited. This kind of understanding is a good start, and in the future, we should further put down our airs, earnestly listen to the opinions of the masses, abandon face, and humbly accept the criticism of the masses. Unity-criticism-unity is the Party's consistent policy for the peaceful transformation of us intellectuals. Unity is of course welcome, but it is more important to accept criticism. Especially for us older scientific workers, on the one hand, we must rely on the leadership of the Party, and on the other hand, we must rely on the help of the masses, especially the help of young people. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "Older intellectuals should also learn from the strengths of young intellectuals." We should always remember this instruction of Premier Zhou.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, we scientific workers should strictly demand ourselves and strive to advance in the direction of being both red and expert. On the basis of the great victory of 1958, we should realize a greater leap forward in scientific research work in 1959 to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland - the People's Republic of China.

### 水生生物科学研究的大转变  王家楫代表的发言

    水生生物科学研究的大转变
    王家楫代表的发言各位代表：
    我衷心拥护周恩来总理对政府工作的报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告及彭真副委员长对全国人大常务委员会的工作报告。这四个报告更照亮了加速建设祖国社会主义的光明大道，指出了今后全中国人民更进一步努力的方向，大大地加强了我们的信心和勇气，必须在一九五八年伟大胜利的基础上，去实现一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进。一九五八年随着工农业生产大跃进，科学研究工作也获得飞速的发展。在全国范围内作出了很多从来所没有过的跃进成果。科学工作的跃进，并非偶然的。只有通过整风、反右、拔白旗插红旗等一系列运动之后，开展了两条道路两种方法的斗争，解决了党对科学研究的绝对领导问题，打破了科学研究不能走群众路线的错误思想，才能把科学工作正确地向着社会主义道路迈进，真正为社会主义建设而服务。现在我就把自己最熟悉的水生生物研究所整风前后的情况，向代表们作一简单的汇报。
    过去水生生物研究脱离生产和实际，冷冷清清，整风以后，联系生产和实际，工作有了根本的转变
    水生生物研究所，是中国科学院的老所之一。连同解放前的年代也计算在内，已有三十年的悠久历史。历史久，好的方面，是有了一个老底子；但另方面，因为是老所，自我个人起也就遗留下来了一套老思想、老观点和老作风。突出的表现在迷信权威、迷信洋书、迷信教条，几乎无往而不迷信。研究人员、特别是老科学家，大多数脱离政治，不仅自己只专不红，而且还希望青年走多专少红的道路。认为联系实际的工作理论性不强，使研究工作长时期脱离了实际。为了追求盲目的理论，甚至对长江三峡建坝后影响宜昌产卵场的研究，青草鲢鳙人工控制产卵的研究，总结我国淡水养鱼经验等与国民经济有关的重大项目，都采取消极、冷淡或竟拒绝的错误态度。强调科学研究需要安静的环境，于是关起门来，在象牙塔里搞些劳动人民所不可思议的名堂。由于脱离生产、脱离实际的结果，也就严重地脱离了群众，使水生生物研究所成为一个“冷冷清清的科学衙门”。
    解放后特别是党对研究所的全面领导确立以后，通过了整风大大地解放了全所人员的思想，老科学家批判了保守思想，青年人从此打破迷信，鼓足干劲，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格。在青老结合，民主团结的基础上，有力地推动了研究工作的大跃进。自一九五八年七月一日，庆祝党的生日那天起，青年同志干劲冲天，日夜劳动，在连续苦战短短六个月的时间内，十月一日及一九五九年元旦两次向党献礼，共有二十六个项目。其中如在华中地区的气候条件下，鲤鱼冬季产卵孵化成功，打破了鲤鱼产卵的季节性限制，使在人工控制下，为四季生产鱼苗，开辟了一条广阔的道路。又如对固氮蓝藻的研究，在已经找出的四种中，已有一种的固氮量超过了世界最高水平的日本，从而在农田水稻方面，提供“万年肥”的供应途径。再如对营养价值很高的小球藻和栅藻的培养，不仅产量已显著地超过现有的国际最高水平，而且找到了一年四季中都可以培养的高产品种和培养方法。更如鱼体免疫，无论在国内或国外，很少有人做过；但在大跃进中，运用免疫方法来控制我国在淡水养殖中危害最大的青草鱼细菌性肠胃炎，已获得初步成果。一九五九年为了结合当前生产方面的迫切需要，已展开了全面总结我国的淡水养鱼经验，并继续进行青草鲢鳙人工控制产卵、鱼类饲料、加速鱼类生长、扩大养殖对象、提高湖水肥力、长江水产资源调查等项目。总之，整风以后，水生所确已乘着全国工农业大跃进的东风，取得了带有根本性的转变，“轰轰烈烈”开始代替了“冷冷清清”，才能作出过去所想像不到的成绩。
    掌握了马克思主义的党是人民事业的“大内行”，一切“小内行”只有在这个“大内行”的领导、帮助和教育之下，才能发挥自己的作用
    水生所的大转变对我个人来讲，是受了一次最严肃、最深刻的、活生生的现实教育。教育了我必须诚诚恳恳接受党的领导，教育了我科学研究工作同样地必须政治挂帅，必须走群众路线。
    领导我们一切事业的核心力量是中国共产党，科学研究当然不能例外。在整风以前，遇到业务问题，我虽然也和党支部负责同志商量，但每逢党支部和少数老科学家有不同意见的时候，我总是采纳少数老科学家的意见，不会再考虑党支部的意见。这样就离开了党的领导，使水生所的工作，在八年多的时间内脱离了正确的研究方向给工作带来很大的损失。掌握马克思列宁主义理论武器的党，是推动全人类凡百事业的舵手，是劳动人民所公认的“大内行”。右派分子的所谓“内行”和自以为内行的资产阶级科学家，充其量不过是一个很小的“小内行”。“小内行”只有在“大内行”的领导、帮助、教育之下，才能发挥比较大一些作用。自己既然有所专长，就应该积极帮助党加强对业务的领导，应该根据党的方针政策，把自己的工作结合到生产实践中去，还应该经常不断地向党交心，想啥说啥，有啥说啥，真正做到开诚相见。
    客观形势天天在大变，就不能满足于主观思想的小变，年纪大一点的科学工作者，一方面要依靠党的领导，另方面要依靠群众的帮助
    通过了一年多的整风运动，我们知识分子虽然都有不同程度的进步，但不能说自己的政治立场已经取得根本的解决，自己的学术思想已经没有问题。政治挂帅决不是一件轻而易举的事情。客观形势天天在大变，如果主观思想只有小变，政治的帅就很难挂上或挂好。现在我还有不少朋友，谈起业务来总是津津有味，一接触思想仍旧闭口无言。应该认识到，过去的脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际，决不是偶然的错误，而是自己脑袋里很少或甚至没有工人阶级世界观所造成的必然结果，工作更要忙起来了，容易对自我改造产生厌倦情绪。改造为了跃进工作，通过工作跃进的实践，也更会提高认识和觉悟，也就是说，政治挂帅和业务上马，二者互相推动，互相促进，彼此统一的。
    一九五八年科学研究工作的大跃进，是和大搞群众运动分不开的。但显而易见，特别在科学文教机构，只有党掌握了绝对领导权以后，才能够真正走上了群众路线。通过了群众运动和跃进的巨大成绩，科学家们已开始认识到群众的确有无穷的智慧和力量，而自己的一得之知，一技之长实在很有限。这样的认识是良好的开端，今后还应该进一步放下架子，认真倾听群众的意见，抛弃面子，虚心接受群众的批评。团结——批评——团结，是党对我们知识分子进行和平改造始终不变的方针。团结当然应该欢迎，但更重要的必须接受批评。特别是我们年纪大一些的科学工作者，一方面既要依靠党的领导，另方面又要依靠群众的帮助，尤其是青年人的帮助。周总理在报告中曾指出，“年长的知识分子也要学习青年知识分子的长处”。我们应该经常记住周总理的这一指示。
    我们科学工作，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，都应该严格要求自己，向着又红又专的方向奋勇前进，在一九五八年伟大胜利的基础上，去实现一九五九年科学研究工作的更大跃进，来迎接我们伟大祖国——中华人民共和国建立的十周年。
