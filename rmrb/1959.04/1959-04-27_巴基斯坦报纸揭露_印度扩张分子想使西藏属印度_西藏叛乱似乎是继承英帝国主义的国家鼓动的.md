Xinhua News Agency, April 25th dispatch from Karachi: Some Pakistani newspapers have recently stated in their published commentaries that the conspiracy of Indian expansionists to make Tibet belong to India and their interference in China's internal affairs is no longer a secret.

The Pakistani newspaper "Today's News" pointed out in a commentary on the Tibetan rebellion that "After the end of British rule in Tibet, it did not like the new situation in Tibet. As the successor to British power, India has also often tried to make Tibet belong to India. This is the reason why Britain and India exaggerate Tibetan news." The newspaper said, "China's condemnation of them should be taken seriously."

The "New Light Evening News" said in an editorial about India's relationship with the Tibetan rebellion, "The Tibetan rebellion seems to be instigated by a country that wants to seize the leadership of Asia, has long been interested in Tibet, and inherits British imperialism." The newspaper believes that India's activities in this regard "are no longer a secret."

    巴基斯坦报纸揭露
    印度扩张分子想使西藏属印度
    西藏叛乱似乎是继承英帝国主义的国家鼓动的
    新华社25日讯　卡拉奇消息：巴基斯坦的一些报纸最近在它们发表的评论中表示，印度扩张主义分子企图使西藏属于印度和它们干涉中国内政的阴谋已经不是什么秘密了。
    巴基斯坦“今天报”在评论西藏叛乱事件时指出，“英国在西藏的统治被结束以后，对西藏的新情况并不喜欢，作为英国势力继承人的印度，也常企图使西藏属于印度，这就是英国和印度夸张西藏新闻的原因”。这家报纸说，“中国对它们的谴责是应当重视的”。
    “新光晚报”在一篇社论中谈到印度同西藏叛乱的关系时说，“西藏叛乱似乎是被一个想夺取亚洲领导、对西藏早怀兴趣、继承英帝国主义的国家所鼓动的”。这家报纸认为，印度在这方面的活动，“已不再是一个秘密了”。
