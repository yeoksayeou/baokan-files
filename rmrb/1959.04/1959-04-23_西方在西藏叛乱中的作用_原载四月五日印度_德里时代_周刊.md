    The Role of the West in the Tibetan Rebellion
    Originally published in the Indian weekly "Delhi Times," April 5th.
    Editor's Note: The Indian weekly "Delhi Times" published an article by its special correspondent on April 5th, entitled "The Role of the West in the Tibetan Rebellion," exposing how imperialism used Kalimpong as a spy center to conduct activities against Tibet. The following is a summary of the article:

    Even during British rule, Kalimpong gained a reputation as a center for espionage, mainly directed against Tibet. For example, Mr. Hugh Richardson, the last Briton working in the free Indian diplomatic service, was also the last British political officer in Tibet. Before leaving India, he established a spy network based in Kalimpong. This spy network was established actually three or four years after our independence, practically when People's China extended its power to Lhasa.

    A well-known figure residing in Kalimpong was Prince Peter of Greece.

    I was told that this prince regularly received remittances from abroad, amounting to more than 25,000 rupees per month. Soon, the Indian police became interested in the prince's activities. They discovered that he frequently traveled to Tibet, Nepal, and Pakistan. He cultivated many connections in these countries.

    A foreigner who had converted to Buddhism was Bhikshu Sangharakshita. He formerly belonged to the Royal Air Force and his original name was Captain White. He and another former Royal Air Force lieutenant colonel (now known by his Buddhist name, Angarika Smasararatna) jointly led the Buddhist Youth Association. Many people suspect that this organization was extremely interested in Tibetan politics and had connections with Tibet.

    A Scottish woman named Kazini Ilsa Marie frequently visited Bhikshu's temple.

    Her house was a favorite meeting place for foreigners, especially Tibetan exiles. She was also a friend to foreign journalists who came to this region of the world.

    Western travelers usually stayed at the best hotel in Kalimpong, the Himalayan Hotel, whose owner was Mr. David MacDonald. He was formerly the British trade agent in Gyantse, Tibet. He was very close to the 13th Dalai Lama.

    The famous American commentator and world traveler Lowell Thomas made a hurried trip to Tibet in 1949, around the same time that the People's Liberation Army was driving the American-backed Chiang Kai-shek's army out of mainland China.

    The British writer Patterson often sent hearsay as news to the London "Daily Telegraph."

    Patterson's experience is most interesting. He came to Tibet at the end of 1947.

    As the People's Liberation Army advanced, Patterson swam to India, and he maintained contact with the Khampa people. Linka Giai Bang, whom this author openly calls a "bandit leader" in his book, was his good friend in India. Giai Bang's task seemed to be to organize aid for the Tibetan "freedom fighters." He actually took an unknown route to India, passing through the Northeast Frontier Agency.

    There was once news that someone repeatedly asked a French woman who believed in Buddhism to participate in underground work to incite the Tibetan people, and when she refused, she was threatened with danger. She left Kalimpong.

    Another British female journalist recently wrote publicly that she attended a secret meeting of the Khampa rebel committee somewhere in India. This statement has not been denied to this day.

### 西方在西藏叛乱中的作用  原载四月五日印度“德里时代”周刊

    西方在西藏叛乱中的作用
    原载四月五日印度“德里时代”周刊
    编者按：印度“德里时代”周刊4月5日发表了该报特派记者的一篇文章，题为“西方在西藏叛乱中的作用”，揭露帝国主义利用噶伦堡作为间谍中心，进行针对西藏的活动，现将这篇文章摘要发表如下：
    即便在英国人统治的时候，噶伦堡就获得了间谍中心这个名声，它的矛头主要是对着西藏的。譬如休·理查逊先生，他是在自由印度外交界工作的最后一个英国人，他也是西藏的最后一个英国政治官员。他在离开印度以前，建立了一个间谍网，基地在噶伦堡。在我国独立了三四年以后，实际上是当人民中国把它的权力扩展到拉萨的时候，这个间谍网就建立了。
    居住在噶伦堡的一位众所周知的人物是希腊的彼得王子。
    有人告诉我，这位王子经常得到外国的汇款，每月有二万五千多卢比。不久，印度警察对这位王子的行动感到了兴趣。他们发现，他经常到西藏、尼泊尔和巴基斯坦去。他在这些国家搞到了很多关系。
    一个信奉了佛教的外国人是比克舒·桑加拉克希特。他以前是属于皇家空军的，原来的名字是怀特上尉。他和另一位前皇家空军的中校（现在他的佛教名字是安加里克·斯马沙那拉特纳）一起领导佛教青年会。许多人怀疑，这个组织对西藏政治极感兴趣，和西藏有联系。
    经常到比克舒的寺院去的有一位苏格兰妇女，名叫卡济尼·伊耳莎·玛丽。
    她的房子是外国人特别是西藏游民喜欢在那里碰头的地方。她也是来到世界这个地区的外国记者的朋友。
    西方来的旅客通常是住在噶伦堡的最好的旅馆——喜马拉雅旅馆，它的老板是戴维·麦克唐纳先生。他以前是英国在西藏江孜的贸易代理人。他和第十三世达赖喇嘛非常接近。
    著名的美国评论家和世界旅行家娄厄耳·托马斯在1949年，大约在人民解放军正在把美国支持的蒋介石军队赶出中国大陆的同一时候，匆匆忙忙到西藏去了一趟。
    英国作家派特逊经常把道听途说的一些东西当作消息发给伦敦的“每日电讯报”。
    派特逊的经历是最引人兴趣的。他于1947年年底来到西藏。
    在人民解放军向前挺进的时候，派特逊游到印度，他一直和康巴人保持着联系。这位作者在他的书中公开称之为“匪首”的林卡·吉阿邦是他在印度的好朋友。吉阿邦的任务似乎是为西藏的“自由战士”组织援助。他来印度所走的实际上是没人知道的道路，这条路是通过东北边境特区的。
    曾经有过这样一个消息，有人一再要一位相信佛教的法国妇女参加煽动西藏人民的地下工作，当她拒绝时，就用危险来威胁她。她离开了噶伦堡。
    另一位英国女记者不久以前公开写道，她在印度某个地方参加了一次康巴叛乱分子委员会的秘密会议。这句话到现在仍然没人否认。
