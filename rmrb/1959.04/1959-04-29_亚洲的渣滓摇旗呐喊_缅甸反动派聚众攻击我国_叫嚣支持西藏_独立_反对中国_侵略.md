Xinhua News Agency, April 27th, Rangoon Dispatch: The Burmese Democratic Party, known for its pro-American and anti-communist stance, along with other reactionary organizations in a hastily assembled "Preparatory Committee," gathered a group of people in Rangoon on the 26th to hold a "meeting." They used the Tibetan rebellion to incite anti-China and anti-communist sentiments, and took the opportunity to demand the abandonment of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, supporting the so-called "independence of Tibet."

According to "The Nation" newspaper, the chairman of the Burmese Democratic Party, Deqin Ba Sheng, the head of the Burmese branch of the "Asian Anti-Communist League," who has always relied on the whims of his American masters, openly opposed the Chinese government exercising its sovereignty in its own territory of Tibet at the meeting. He said that China had no right to "interfere" in Tibetan affairs. He also incited that Buddhists should not "stand idly by" regarding what happened in Tibet.

Wu Dami, the abbot of a temple in Rangoon, also spoke at the meeting. He described the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet as "suppressing Tibetan religion" and clamored that this "must be publicly opposed." Wu Dami even frantically incited anti-communist sentiment, demanding that "those who govern the country must be prepared to fight communism with a clear attitude and encourage citizens to engage in various forms of anti-communist activities."

On the same afternoon, a group of unreasonable monks in Rangoon held a "meeting" at the Great Golden Pagoda. A small group of Chiang Kai-shek followers in Rangoon, long spurned by the Chinese people, also took the opportunity to stir up trouble at the meeting.

The meeting passed nine so-called "resolutions" that slanderously and attacked China.

The "resolutions" not only reversed black and white, distorted facts, and described the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet as "the atrocities of red China's expansionists," "aggression against Buddhist Tibet," and "destruction of Buddhism and Tibetan freedom," they even absurdly claimed that Tibet had historically been a "country." The "resolutions" also expressed "support for the freedom and independence of Tibet" and demanded that the so-called "free world" immediately recognize Tibet's "independence."

The "resolutions" openly interfered in China's internal affairs, demanding that the Chinese army withdraw from its own territory of Tibet.

The "resolutions" blatantly sought to undermine the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It demanded that "countries that have recognized the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence reconsider and retract their recognition of these principles," falsely claiming that "these principles are deceptive" and that they contribute to China's "expansion" and "aggression."

The "resolutions" also fantasized about alienating China's relations with other countries, demanding that those "democratic countries that have recognized Communist China withdraw this recognition."

Even more absurdly, this "resolution" even smeared "communism as a danger to religious freedom, national freedom, and the Three Jewels of Buddhism."

    亚洲的渣滓摇旗呐喊
    缅甸反动派聚众攻击我国
    叫嚣支持西藏“独立”反对中国“侵略”
    新华社27日讯　仰光消息：以亲美反共出名的缅甸民主党同其他反动组织凑集起来的“筹备委员会”26日在仰光搜罗了一批人举行“集会”，利用西藏叛乱事件煽动反对中国和反共的情绪，并且趁机要求放弃和平共处五项原则，支持所谓“西藏的独立事业”。
    据“民族报”消息，一向仰仗美国主子鼻息行事的缅甸民主党主席、“亚洲反共同盟”缅甸支部的首领德钦巴盛在会上公然反对中国政府在自己的领土西藏行使主权，他说什么中国没有权利“干涉”西藏的事务。他还煽动说，佛教徒不应该对西藏发生的事“袖手旁观”。
    仰光一所寺院的主持吴达米也在会上讲了话。他把中国政府平息西藏的叛乱说成是“压制西藏的宗教”，并且叫嚷对此“必须公开加以反对”。吴达米甚至疯狂煽动反共情绪，要“那些治理国家的人必须准备以一种明确的态度来同共产主义作斗争，并且鼓励公民进行各种形式的反共活动。”
    同一天下午，仰光一批无理取闹的僧侣等在大金塔也举行了“集会”，在仰光的一小撮早为中国人民唾弃的蒋帮分子也乘机在会上兴风作浪。
    会上通过了九项大肆诽谤和攻击中国的所谓“决议”。
    “决议”不仅颠倒黑白，歪曲事实，把中国政府平定西藏的叛乱说成是“赤色中国的扩张主义者的暴行”，“侵略佛教徒的西藏”，“破坏佛教和西藏的自由”，甚至荒唐地说，西藏在历史上就是一个“国家”。“决议”还表示“支持西藏的自由和独立”，并且要求所谓“自由世界”立即承认西藏的“独立”。
    “决议”公然干涉中国的内政，要中国军队从自己的领土西藏撤退。
    “决议”明目张胆地要破坏和平共处五项原则。它要求承认和平共处五项原则的“国家重新考虑和收回对这些原则的承认”，胡说什么“这些原则是骗人的”，它们有助于中国的“扩张”和“侵略”。
      “决议”还异想天开地企图离间中国和其他国家的关系。要那些已经“承认共产党中国的民主国家收回这种承认”。
    更加荒诞的是这项“决议”竟污蔑“共产主义是对宗教自由、民族自由和佛教三宝的危险”。
