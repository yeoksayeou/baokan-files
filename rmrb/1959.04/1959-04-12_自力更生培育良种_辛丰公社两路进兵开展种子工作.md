　　Self-Reliance in Cultivating Superior Seeds
    Xinfeng Commune Advances on Two Fronts to Carry Out Seed Work
    (Our report) Xinfeng People's Commune in Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province, has specifically arranged this year's superior seed breeding work, planning to breed nine rice varieties, three each of soybeans and corn, two of sweet potatoes, and superior seeds for small grains, cotton, and other crops, to ensure "self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use" in 1959. While breeding general superior seeds, the commune also plans to replace 30% of the currently used superior seeds with varieties that produce even higher yields.
    This year's breeding work in Xinfeng Commune is based on last year's efforts. To meet the commune's needs for seeds, after the establishment of the commune last year, the commune Party committee adopted a two-pronged approach. On one hand, it established specialized seed organizations to prepare for long-term superior seed breeding. On the other hand, it mobilized the masses to select and retain superior seeds to meet urgent production needs.
    Xinfeng Commune's specialized seed organizations were established at two levels, drawing on the experience of seed work during the agricultural cooperative period and in light of the specific conditions of the commune. The commune has a superior seed breeding farm, and the production brigade has specialized seed teams. The superior seeds bred by the commune's superior seed breeding farm are supplied to the production brigades for further breeding, while the production brigade's specialized seed teams are responsible for breeding the seeds needed by their own teams. In addition to breeding superior seeds, the commune's seed breeding farm and the major brigades' seed teams are also responsible for trial planting, selection, and breeding of new varieties, as well as seed storage and inspection. In order to better breed a certain crop seed, Xinfeng Commune has also established "specially designated superior seed breeding areas" in addition to the breeding farm and specialized teams. The natural conditions of the Tenth Brigade of the commune are particularly suitable for breeding "Zhan Yang Peanuts," and all the peanut seeds needed by the commune are bred by this brigade.
    The seed breeding farm and seed teams of the commune have established seed warehouses and assigned specific personnel to be responsible for storage. The superior seed breeding farm has also purchased simple instruments, established a seed testing laboratory, and opened a seed technical school to train technical personnel for the major brigades.
    According to Xinfeng Commune's experience, in the case of large cultivated areas, complex crops, and many varieties, adopting a two-level approach to breeding superior seeds can overcome the contradictions brought about by centralized breeding, such as centralized harvesting, drying, storage, and transportation. This is of great benefit for saving labor and ensuring the quantity and quality of superior seeds.
    While establishing specialized seed organizations, the commune also focused on the work of selecting and retaining seeds, thus ensuring the superior seeds urgently needed for production. Before the autumn harvest last year, the commune Party committee formulated a seed selection plan and selected and retained more than 5 million jin of superior seeds of major crops such as rice, soybeans, and cotton. These seeds are enough to meet the needs of this year's spring sowing. For the needs of this year's autumn sowing, the commune also plans to select and harvest more than 3 million jin of superior seeds from this year's three-wheat superior seed fields.

### 自力更生培育良种  辛丰公社两路进兵开展种子工作

　　自力更生培育良种
    辛丰公社两路进兵开展种子工作
    本报讯　江苏镇江市辛丰人民公社具体布置了今年的良种繁殖工作，计划繁殖水稻品种九个，大豆、玉米各三个，甘薯二个和小杂粮、棉花等作物的良种，保证1959年做到“自繁、自选、自留、自用”。这个社在繁殖一般良种的同时，还计划把30％的现用良种换成产量更高的良种。
    辛丰公社的今年的繁殖工作是在去年的基础上进行的。为了要满足公社对种子的需要，在去年公社建立以后，社党委就采取了两路进兵的办法，一方面成立种子专业机构，为长期繁育良种作好准备；一方面发动群众选留良种，满足生产的急需。
    辛丰公社的种子专业机构是吸取农业社时期种子工作的经验参照公社具体情况分两级建立的，公社设有良种繁育场，生产大队设有种子专业队。公社良种繁育场繁育的良种，供给生产大队再繁殖用，生产大队种子专业队负责繁殖本队需要的良种。社的种子繁育场和各大队的种子专业队在繁殖良种的同时，还担负新品种的试种、选育和种子保管、检验等。辛丰公社为了更好地繁殖一种作物种子，还在繁育场、专业队以外建立了“特约良种繁殖区”。这个社的十大队的自然条件特别适合繁殖“站秧花生”，全社需要的花生种就全部由这个大队繁殖。
    这个社的种子繁育场和种子专业队都分别建立了种子仓库，指定专人负责保管。良种繁育场还购置了简单的仪器，成立了种子检验室和开办了种子技术学校，为各大队培养技术人材。
    根据辛丰公社的体会，在耕地面积大、作物复杂、品种多的情况下，采用两级繁殖良种可以克服因集中繁殖而带来的集中收晒、保管、搬运等矛盾，对于节省劳动力，保证良种的数量和质量都有很大好处。
    这个社在建立种子专业机构的同时，还抓住了选留种子工作，因此，保证了生产上急需的良种。去年秋收前公社党委制订选种计划，选留了水稻、大豆、棉花等主要作物良种五百多万斤。这些种子足够今年春播的需要。为了今年秋种的需要，这个社还准备在今年的三麦良种田中选收三百多万斤良种。
