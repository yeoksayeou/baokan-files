Promote Pinyin Alphabet Among Young and Middle-Aged People
Wang Qingzheng
Vice Governor of Heilongjiang Province
Deputy Director of the Heilongjiang Province Popularization of Mandarin Work Committee

In order to meet the needs of the rapid development of socialist construction and actively carry out technological and cultural revolutions, we must also make a great leap forward in the work of promoting the pinyin alphabet and popularizing Mandarin so as to effectively help consolidate and expand the achievements of literacy campaigns, accelerate the improvement of the cultural level of the people of the entire province, and enable cultural and educational undertakings to better serve the development of production.

The work of promoting the pinyin alphabet and popularizing Mandarin in Heilongjiang Province has a history of more than three years. During this period, we have carried out multifaceted publicity and education work on promoting the pinyin alphabet and popularizing Mandarin; trained primary and secondary school teachers, some government cadres, and a large number of mass teachers throughout the province; compiled and printed some pinyin alphabet and Mandarin teaching materials suitable for local characteristics; and completed the dialect survey work in Heilongjiang Province. At present, the task of promoting the pinyin alphabet has been basically completed in primary and secondary schools and normal schools throughout the province, and a preliminary atmosphere of speaking Mandarin has been formed among a considerable number of teachers and students. Now, this work is gradually expanding to the broad masses of workers and peasants, and some places like Baiquan County, Tonghe County, as well as Tailai, Ning'an, and Kedong counties and Jiamusi, Qiqihar, and other cities have already formed mass movements. The result of promoting the pinyin alphabet among the broad masses of workers and peasants has shown an extremely important role in consolidating and expanding the achievements of literacy campaigns and accelerating the improvement of people's cultural learning; it has also proved that it is very beneficial to learn Mandarin using the pinyin alphabet.

In the work, various places have accumulated many good experiences. The main experiences are:

First, it is necessary to closely rely on the leadership of the Party and adhere to putting politics in command. Since this is a new task, there will inevitably be many ideological obstacles among the masses; resolving these ideological problems must be done under the leadership of the Party through extensive publicity and education. Also, since this is a mass work related to the entire people, it is directly related to production in terms of time and manpower. Therefore, it must be properly arranged under the leadership of the Party so that this work can be smoothly carried out in conjunction with the central movement and production tasks.

Second, it is necessary to form a large teacher team and compile teaching materials suitable for the needs of various different objects. Promoting the pinyin alphabet and popularizing Mandarin is an extremely broad mass work, and completing this task is not something that a few people can easily do. Therefore, it is necessary to train a large teacher team. The experience of Baiquan and Tonghe and other places proves that as long as we break the mysterious view and believe in the masses, take materials locally, and adopt the method of cultivating level by level, teaching in segments, learning and teaching simultaneously, and gradually improving, the source of teachers is inexhaustible.

Third, it is necessary to create a widespread mass movement. On the one hand, the whole people should teach and the whole people should learn. With the vast number of teachers as the backbone, advocate that everyone who knows how should teach those who don't, those who know more should teach those who know less, and implement immediate transmission, mutual learning, and mutual teaching. On the other hand, we must widely arrange the learning environment and create a strong learning atmosphere. Using pinyin signboards, phonetic slogans, phonetic annotations of objects, and other forms, make it possible for people to have pinyin alphabet to learn everywhere, and to learn Chinese characters according to the phonetic annotations everywhere.

Fourth, teaching the pinyin alphabet should be combined with production, the popularization of Mandarin, and cultural learning. The work of promoting the pinyin alphabet among workers and peasants is mainly carried out by using spare time from production. Therefore, throughout the entire work process, we must firmly establish the concept of combining with production.

Promoting the pinyin alphabet should also be linked to the task of consolidating and expanding the achievements of eliminating illiteracy and linked to the popularization of Mandarin. From the perspective of eliminating illiteracy, some relapse phenomena have been generally discovered. The main reason is of course that after eliminating illiteracy, learning was not continued, but also due to various reasons, such as frequent travel, illness, childbirth, or living too scattered, etc. If these people master the pinyin alphabet and use it as a tool, they can learn independently without a teacher. In this way, the phenomenon of relapse can be avoided.

We must build on the existing achievements, redouble our efforts, advance victoriously, and strive to basically complete the task of promoting the pinyin alphabet among young and middle-aged people throughout the province in a relatively short period of time. We plan to achieve the following goals in about one year: professional actors and announcers throughout the province should be able to use Mandarin skillfully and accurately on the basis of mastering the alphabet; schools at all levels should consolidate and improve the ability to use the pinyin alphabet, so that all primary and secondary school and normal school students can skillfully master and use the pinyin alphabet, and can basically accurately use Mandarin; the broad masses of cadres and service personnel should all master the pinyin alphabet and initially form an atmosphere where everyone speaks Mandarin; among the workers and peasants, 80% of young and middle-aged people should learn the pinyin alphabet and use it to eliminate the remaining illiteracy and consolidate and expand the achievements of literacy campaigns, so that all those who have relapsed after literacy can be completely restored. At the same time, use it to practice correct pronunciation and gradually popularize Mandarin.

In order to achieve the above goals, we require: teachers at all levels of schools should take the lead, speak well themselves when teaching, and strictly require students to teach the pinyin alphabet well in Chinese classes; at the same time, strengthen extracurricular review and practice, and use lectures, reading sessions, and observation meetings, etc., to improve the accuracy and proficiency of standard pronunciation. Office workers and service industry workers, all those who participate in spare-time school learning should uniformly learn in spare-time schools, and those who have not participated in spare-time school learning should use spare time to organize separately and learn collectively. At the same time, lectures and observation meetings should be held in a planned way, so as to gradually form an atmosphere of speaking Mandarin. Workers and peasants should all organize learning through literacy classes, groups, and spare-time schools. A small number of those who cannot participate in spare-time schools should learn through decentralized forms such as contracted teaching and guaranteed learning. All literacy classes, groups, and spare-time schools at all levels throughout the province should include teaching the pinyin alphabet in the teaching plan, allocate a period of time for concentrated assault, and after the masses have mastered the pinyin alphabet, those who are still illiterate should use it to carry out literacy, and those who have relapsed should use it to recover. The literacy results have been consolidated, and those who are studying in spare-time primary and secondary schools should gradually master the pinyin alphabet skillfully in combination with normal teaching and correct local pronunciation.

    在青壮年中推行拼音字母
    黑龙江省副省长
    黑龙江省推广普通话工作委员会副主任  王清正
    为了适应社会主义建设迅速发展的需要，积极地进行技术革命、文化革命，我们要在推行拼音字母和推广普通话工作上也大跃进，以便有效地帮助巩固和扩大扫盲成果，加速地提高全省人民的文化水平，使文化教育事业更好地为生产的发展服务。
    黑龙江省推行拼音字母和推广普通话的工作已经有三年多的历史了。在这个期间，我们对于推行拼音字母和推广普通话进行了多方面的宣传教育工作；培训了全省的中、小学教师和一部分机关干部以及很大一批群众教师；编印了一些适合地方特点的拼音字母和普通话教材；并且完成了黑龙江省的方言调查工作。目前，在全省中小学、师范学校已经基本完成了推行拼音字母的任务，在相当一部分教师和学生中已经初步形成了说普通话的风气。现在，这项工作正在逐渐向广大的工农群众中扩展，并且已经出现了像拜泉县、通河县以及泰来、宁安、克东等县和佳木斯、齐齐哈尔等市这样一些形成了群众运动的地方。拼音字母在广大工农群众中推行的结果，已经在巩固扩大扫盲成果和加速提高人民文化学习方面显示了极其重要的作用；同时也证明了利用拼音字母学习普通话大有好处。
    在工作中，各地已经积累了许多好的经验。主要的经验是：
    第一，要紧紧依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。由于这是一件新的工作，群众中必然会有许多这样或那样的思想障碍；解决这些思想问题，必须在党的领导下，通过广泛的宣传教育才能办到。又由于这是一项关系到全民性的群众工作，在时间上和人力上都和生产有直接关系，因此，必须在党的领导下妥善安排，才能使这项工作结合中心运动和生产任务顺利地开展。
    第二，要形成庞大的教师队伍，编写出适合各种不同对象需要的教材。推行拼音字母和推广普通话，这是一件极其广泛的群众性工作，完成这项任务，并不是少数人可以轻而易举的。因而必须训练庞大的教师队伍。拜泉和通河等地的经验证明，只要打破神秘观点，相信群众，就地取材，采取逐级培养，分段传授，边学边教，逐步提高的办法，师资的来源是取之不尽、用之不竭的。
    第三，要造成广泛的群众性运动。一方面要全民教，全民学。以广大教师为骨干，提倡一切会的人，教不会的人，会的多的人，教会的少的人，实行即知即传，互学互教。另一方面，要广泛地布置学习环境，创造浓厚的学习气氛。利用拼音字牌、标语注音、实物注音等等形式，使人们到处都有拼音字母可学，到处都能按注音学习汉字。
    第四，教学拼音字母要结合生产，结合推广普通话和文化学习。在工农群众中推行拼音字母的工作，主要是靠生产的业余时间来进行的。因此，在整个工作进行中，都要牢牢地树立起结合生产的观念。
    推行拼音字母还要和巩固扩大扫除文盲成果的任务联系起来，和推广普通话联系起来。从扫除文盲来看，目前普遍发现了一些回生现象，主要原因当然是在扫除文盲以后，没有继续坚持学习，但也由于种种原因，例如经常外出、闹病、生孩子，或者居住过于分散等等。这些人如果掌握了拼音字母，用它做工具，就能无师自学。这样，回生的现象就可以避免了。
    我们要在已有成就的基础上鼓足更大的干劲，乘胜前进，争取在较短的时间内，基本完成在全省青壮年中推行拼音字母的任务。我们在一年左右拟达到下述几项目标：全省的职业演员、播音员，在掌握字母的基础上，能达到熟练、准确地使用普通话；各级学校，要巩固和提高拼音字母的运用能力，使所有的中、小学和师范学校的学生都能熟练地掌握和运用拼音字母，并能基本上准确地使用普通话；广大的干部和服务人员，要全部掌握拼音字母，并初步形成一个人人都说普通话的风气；在工农群众中，80％的青壮年要学会拼音字母，并运用它扫除剩余的文盲和巩固扩大扫盲成果，使所有扫盲后回生了的人，能全部回熟。同时用它练习正音，逐步推广普通话。
    为了达到上述目标，我们要求：各级学校的教师要先走一步，教课时自己带头说好，并且严格地要求学生，教好语文课中的拼音字母；同时加强课外复习和练习，利用讲演会、朗读会和观摩会等等，以提高标准语音的准确程度和熟练程度。机关工作人员和服务性行业的工作人员，凡是参加业余学校学习的，要统一在业余学校中学习，没有参加业余学校学习的，要利用业余时间，单独组织，集中学习，同时要有计划地举办讲演会、观摩会等，以便逐步形成说普通话的风气。工农群众都要通过扫盲班、组和业余学校组织学习，少数不能参加业余学校的要通过包教保学等分散形式进行学习。全省所有扫盲班、组和各级业余学校，都要把教学拼音字母列入教学计划，划定一段时间集中突击，当群众掌握了拼音字母以后，还是文盲的，要通过它进行扫盲，已经回生了的，要借助它回熟。扫盲成果已经巩固，正在业余中、小学学习的，就结合正常教学，逐步作到熟练地运用拼音字母，校正地方语音。
