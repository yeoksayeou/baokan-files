   Finally Unable to Suppress the Anger in My Heart

   To the Editor:

    We Chinese people have always cherished the friendship with the Indian people, and even in the most激动的时刻 we will not forget this friendship. Precisely because of this, we will never allow a small handful of Indian expansionists to sow discord and hatred between the Chinese and Indian people. However, friendship must be based on equality and joint effort. Recently, in a once-friendly neighboring country, activities interfering in our internal affairs have emerged, and we cannot help but feel extremely regretful about this. What is particularly infuriating is that the incidents of insulting our national leaders occurred with the connivance of the Indian police. People can't help but ask, do you still intend to continue implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the policy of Sino-Indian friendship? Of course, it is up to the Indian government to implement such or such a policy, but the Chinese people cannot ignore such serious incidents that undermine peaceful coexistence and Sino-Indian friendship.

   再也抑制不下心头的怒火编辑同志：
    我们中国人民一向十分珍贵同印度人民的友谊，即使是在最激动的时刻我们也不会忘记这种友谊。正因为这样，我们才绝不容许一小撮印度扩张主义分子在中印两国人民之间散布不和和仇恨。然而，友谊是要以平等和共同努力作基础的。最近在曾经是友好的邻邦中，竟然产生干涉我国内政的活动，我们对此不能不感到极大的遗憾。特别令人愤慨的是，侮辱我国领袖的事件是在印度警察的纵容下发生的。人们不禁要问，你们是否还打算继续执行和平共处五项原则和中印友好的政策？当然，执行这样或那样政策是印度政府的事情，但是，中国人民对这种破坏和平共处和中印友谊的严重事件是不能置之不理的。
