    “Piggybacking” is a Good Experience

    The "piggybacking" transportation method implemented by the Xi'an Railway Bureau provides valuable experience for organizing rational transportation and fully utilizing transportation potential. Implementing this method can transport large quantities of goods in a timely manner without increasing vehicles or operating time, enabling railway transportation to better implement the transportation principle of "ensuring both key areas and general needs."

    The main task of railway work is to transport more and faster, to maximize the satisfaction of transportation needs from all aspects of the national economy's Great Leap Forward. According to the principle of "the whole country as a single chessboard," railway transportation departments must guarantee key areas and fulfill the transportation tasks of coal and steel by 100%; the transportation tasks of major materials such as petroleum, timber, and grain must also be guaranteed. While ensuring key areas, general needs must also be taken care of. A certain amount of raw materials for light industry and daily necessities are indispensable for the Great Leap Forward in production and construction and for people's lives, and the railway department should also try to meet the transportation needs of these areas. Although the railway transport capacity seems somewhat insufficient due to the surge in freight volume, as long as various "tricks" are found to fully tap the transportation potential, the task of "taking care of general needs" can be better undertaken. The "piggybacking" experience of the Xi'an Railway Bureau is such a "trick."

    Since it is "piggybacking," as the name suggests, the transport volume will not be very large. How much benefit does this actually bring to the practical work? The facts from the Xi'an Railway Bureau show that "piggybacking" can also accumulate small amounts into large quantities. From November of last year to March 20 of this year, the bureau used various vehicles to piggyback more than 96,300 tons of goods. According to the ratio of 8.5% of the bureau's piggyback transportation volume in March to the total shipment volume, if the national railway system's piggyback transportation all reaches this level, tens of millions of tons of goods can be transported additionally each year. What a considerable number! With the transport capacity to transport so many goods, the transportation needs of raw materials for light industry and daily necessities can naturally be met to a large extent. With a large number of raw materials for light industry and daily necessities transported by piggybacking, the railway department can also free up resources to better ensure key transportation tasks such as coal and steel. Wouldn't this be of great benefit to production and construction?

    Will promoting "piggyback" transportation affect train punctuality or easily lead to errors? The Xi'an Railway Bureau provided the answer with facts: After the transportation organization work was changed and new work systems were established and new work methods were implemented in a timely manner, the bureau did not affect train punctuality or experience business accidents because of "piggybacking"; on the contrary, due to the strengthening of transportation organization work and the collaboration of various departments, accidents were greatly reduced as a result.

    The "piggybacking" transportation experience provided by the Xi'an Railway Bureau can not only be widely adopted in the railway department, but also be promoted in road transportation and water transportation. What is more worthy of promotion is the spirit of the Xi'an Railway Bureau in mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and doing everything possible to tap the transportation potential. By acting in accordance with this spirit, various localities and transportation departments will find many "tricks" to improve transportation capacity to ensure a greater leap forward in industry and agriculture.

### “捎脚”是条好经验

    “捎脚”是条好经验
    西安铁路局实行的“捎脚”运输的办法，为组织合理运输，充分发挥运输潜力提供了可贵的经验。实行这一办法，可以在不增加车辆和作业时间的条件下，及时把大批货物运输出去，使铁路运输能够更好地贯彻“既保证重点又照顾一般”的运输方针。
    铁路工作的主要任务，是多运，快运，最大限度地满足国民经济大跃进中各方面的运输需要。根据“全国一盘棋”的方针，铁路运输部门必须保证重点，百分之百地完成煤炭和钢铁的运输任务；石油、木材、粮食等主要物资的运输任务，也要保证完成。在保证重点的同时，还要照顾一般。一定数量的轻工业原料和生活必需品，是生产建设大跃进和人民生活中不可缺少的，铁路部门也应该尽量满足这些方面的运输需要。现在，虽然由于运量激增，铁路运输能力显得有些不足，但是只要找到各种“窍门”，把运输潜力充分挖掘出来，就能更好地把“照顾一般”的任务担当起来。西安铁路局的“捎脚”经验，就是这样一个“窍门”。
    既然是“捎脚”，顾名思义，运输量不会很大。这对实际工作究竟有多大好处？西安铁路局的事实说明：“捎脚”也能积少成多，集腋成裘。这个局从去年11月到今年3月20日，利用各种车辆捎运的货物有九万六千三百多吨。按照这个局3月份捎脚运输的货物占发货总量8.5％这一比例计算，如果全国铁路系统捎脚运输都达到这个水平，每年就可以多运几千万吨货物。这是一个多么可观的数字！有了能运这么多货物的运输力，自然可以在很大程度上满足轻工业原料和生活必需品的运输需要。大批轻工业原料和生活必需品用捎脚的办法运走了，铁路部门还可以腾出力量，更好地保证煤炭、钢铁等重点运输任务。这岂不对生产建设大有好处吗？
    推行“捎脚”运输，会不会影响列车正点和容易发生差错呢？西安铁路局用事实提供的答案是：由于在运输组织工作改变以后，及时建立了新的工作制度，实行了新的工作方法，这个局并没有因为“捎脚”而影响列车正点或发生商务事故；相反地，由于加强了运输组织工作和各部门的协作，结果大大减少了事故。
    西安铁路局提供的“捎脚”运输的经验，不仅可以在铁路部门广泛采用，而且可以在公路运输和水运中推广。更值得推广的，是西安铁路局发动群众，依靠群众，千方百计挖掘运输潜力的精神。按照这一精神办事，各地、各个运输部门，都将会找出许多提高运输能力的“窍门”，来保证工农业更大的跃进。
