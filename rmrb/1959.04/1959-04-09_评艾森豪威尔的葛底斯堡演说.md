Commenting on Eisenhower's Gettysburg Address

    In order to peddle the increasingly unpopular "Mutual Security Program" within the United States, President Eisenhower delivered a speech entitled "The Importance of Understanding" in Gettysburg on April 4th, instilling in the American people the so-called "necessity" of "understanding our nation's (referring to the United States) goals and role in strengthening the free nations of the world." As always, the American president's speech was filled with clichés such as "the threat of communism," "mutual security is America's security," and "the United States is willing to make significant sacrifices." This shows that American imperialism, in attempting to disguise the aggressive essence of its foreign "aid" policy, has become so impoverished that it can no longer find new words beyond using clichés. Eisenhower's hope of relying on these clichés, which have long been proven bankrupt by facts and are also tiresome to people, to deceive people at home and abroad is, of course, wishful thinking.

    However, Eisenhower did not speak in vain. His speech served as a wake-up call to the people of the world, especially to the people of Southeast Asia. From Eisenhower's speech, one cannot fail to notice the unusual fact that in this speech, which supposedly discussed the "common security" of the entire "free world," Eisenhower devoted two-thirds of its length to discussing the importance of South Vietnam to the United States and the importance of Japan in the "Mutual Security" plan, which, according to Eisenhower himself, "are two sides of the same problem," essentially one problem. At the same time, one cannot fail to notice the fact that Eisenhower's speech was delivered on the same day that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's Washington meeting closed and four days before the opening of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council's Wellington meeting. Therefore, when people "relate one fact in a problem to other facts," as Eisenhower said in his speech, they can clearly determine the new trend in the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism: intensifying the tense situation in Southeast Asia.

    Saying it's a new trend, of course, does not mean that intensifying the tense situation in Southeast Asia is anything new to the United States, but rather that the United States has once again shifted the focus of creating tense situations to Southeast Asia. This shift in focus by the United States is inseparable from the heavy blow its policy of maintaining tension in Europe is suffering. As everyone knows, because the Soviet Union's peaceful proposals on a German peace treaty and the Berlin issue have been widely supported by the people of the world, especially the people of Europe, and because the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is riddled with contradictions on the German issue, the United States is in a very isolated and dilemma-ridden position on the European situation. For U.S. imperialism, which has always used tense situations to carry out war preparations, it is unwilling to negotiate on the basis of the Soviet Union's peaceful proposals and ease the tension in Europe; however, it is also difficult for it to openly resist the trend of easing tension in Europe under the public gaze. Therefore, the United States intends to create new tense situations in Southeast Asia to divert the world's attention, and at the same time use the tense situation in Southeast Asia to obstruct the easing of tension in Europe. If the tense situation in one region is difficult to maintain, it will create tense situations in another region; using a new tense situation in one region to create a tense situation in another region – this has been the habitual trick of U.S. imperialism to maintain international tension since the end of World War II.

    Of course, the United States began this activity actively long before Eisenhower delivered his speech on April 4th. For example, instigating the pro-American government of Prince Sannanikone of the Kingdom of Laos to sabotage the Geneva Accords, using South Vietnam and Thailand to conspire to subvert the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and using South Vietnam to invade China's Xisha Islands, etc. However, Eisenhower's speech formally announced that the United States will launch a larger-scale campaign to create tense situations in Southeast Asia in the coming period. He assured at the beginning of his speech that "there will be no ambiguity in the beliefs I express." Indeed, people can see it without ambiguity from his speech. The United States is determined to use South Vietnam and Japan as the left and right hands of U.S. aggression and control over Asia.

    It is no accident that the U.S. president chose South Vietnam, a place that, according to himself, "is exactly halfway around the world from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania," as a forward base for aggression in Asia. South Vietnam is a strategic stronghold of the United States in the southern part of the Asian continent, which can threaten the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and China to the north, and is also the starting point for its infiltration and aggression into Cambodia and Laos. At present, isn't the United States precisely interfering in and threatening Cambodia's internal affairs through South Vietnam, gradually intensifying its control over Laos, instigating Laos to tear up the Geneva Accords, and gradually turning Laos into a new U.S. military base? When Eisenhower spoke with relish in his speech about the importance of South Vietnam's strategic position, and said that "if South Vietnam is seized by the Communists… the rest of Southeast Asia will be threatened by a large encirclement operation," people cannot help but think of a Chinese saying: "Praising oneself." Just two days after Eisenhower's speech, 12,000 U.S. Navy and Marine Corps held a landing exercise on the coast of Southern California in the United States, and according to the United Press International, the landing site was impartially "hypothesized" to be Cambodia! Does such a blatant military aggression preparation need any comment?

    Eisenhower, using South Vietnam as an example, emphasized the necessity of establishing and maintaining a local military force, which, according to him, would avoid "drafting our (referring to the United States) youth in even larger numbers." This can only prove that the United States is still clinging to the policy of "Asians fighting Asians." At the same time, Eisenhower also used South Vietnam as an example to put forward his so-called path to economic development for underdeveloped countries. It is said that an underdeveloped country cannot adopt a self-reliant approach (he called this "stealing from the people's rice bowls") to obtain the funds necessary for economic development, and that doing so is the "enslavement method" of the Chinese commune system; and that the only way to obtain funds "is through foreign private investment, foreign government loans, and, when necessary, gifts from other countries that are better off." This absurd and ridiculous "theory" only more clearly exposes the U.S. imperialism's intention: to make the economies of underdeveloped countries like South Vietnam (or, in Eisenhower's words, "the whole of Africa and South Asia") completely dependent on imperialism, so as to facilitate their economic enslavement and political control.

    Another thug in the U.S. expansion into Southeast Asia is Japanese militarism. Japan's latent imperialism is also trying to take advantage of U.S. support to actively expand its influence in Southeast Asia. However, in the past period, because Japan's "Southeast Asia Development Plan" aroused suspicion from Southeast Asian countries and also contradicted the interests of the United States itself, the United States has always taken a cold attitude towards Japan's plan. Now, on the one hand, due to the overall strategic needs of the United States, and on the other hand, due to the precarious domestic position of the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government, Eisenhower finally, as a Kyodo News reporter said: "has made up his mind to realize the Southeast Asia Development Plan with Japan as the core."

    In fact, the United States is helping Japan expand into Southeast Asia and strengthen the forces of Japanese militarism on the premise of "being generous with other people's money." Eisenhower strongly hinted in his speech that Japan must not infringe on the U.S. market itself, but at the same time demanded that countries in the resource-rich Southeast Asia region provide raw materials to Japan, and also demanded that the markets of "every industrial country in the West" be open to Japan. According to various sources, one of the main tasks of U.S. representative Dillon attending the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's Wellington meeting is to force the countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to adopt a cooperative attitude towards Japan's Southeast Asia Development Plan.

    This U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to actively help Japan carry out economic expansion in Southeast Asia is a serious threat to the peace and security of the people of Southeast Asian countries. Everyone knows that economic expansion is only a prelude to military aggression; the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" advocated by Japanese imperialism in those years and the disasters it brought are still fresh in the minds of the people of Southeast Asian countries.

    Eisenhower has sent a signal, and the Wellington meeting, under the auspices of the U.S. representative, is also actively deploying new aggression activities in Southeast Asia. The clouds of tension will once again shroud the skies over Southeast Asia. The people of all countries, especially the people of Southeast Asian countries, must be vigilant, unite, thwart the U.S. aggression plan, and safeguard peace and security in Asia.

### 评艾森豪威尔的葛底斯堡演说

    评艾森豪威尔的葛底斯堡演说
    为了兜售在美国国内越来越不得人心的所谓“共同安全计划”，美国总统艾森豪威尔于4月4日在葛底斯堡发表了一篇题为“了解的重要性”的演说，向美国人民灌输所谓“了解我们国家（指美国）在加强世界上的自由国家方面的目标和作用”的“必要性”。同往常一样，美国总统的这篇演说充满了诸如“共产主义的威胁”、“共同安全就是美国的安全”、“美国不惜作出重大牺牲”等等滥调。这说明美帝国主义在力图掩饰它的“援”外政策的侵略实质方面，已经贫乏到除了沿用滥调之外再也找不出新的词句来了。艾森豪威尔指望依靠这些早已被事实证明是破产了的、也为人们所听厌了的滥调来蒙蔽国内外人民，当然是枉费心机。
    然而，艾森豪威尔也没有白费口舌。他的演说对世界人民特别是对东南亚地区的人民，却是敲响了警钟。人们从艾森豪威尔的演说中，不能不注意到这样一个不寻常的事实，那就是：在这篇据称是谈论整个“自由世界”的“共同安全”问题的演说中，艾森豪威尔以三分之二的篇幅谈论了南越对美国的重要性和日本在“共同安全”计划中的重要地位这两个问题，而这两个问题，照艾森豪威尔自己说来，“是一个问题的两个方面”，实质上就是一个问题。同时，人们也不能不注意到这样一个事实：艾森豪威尔的这篇演说正是在北大西洋集团理事会的华盛顿会议闭幕这一天和“东南亚条约组织”理事会的惠灵顿会议开幕前四天发表的。因此，当人们按照艾森豪威尔在他的演说中所说的“把一个问题中的一个事实和其他事实联系起来的时候”，就可以明确地测定出美帝国主义的侵略政策当前的新动向——加剧东南亚地区的紧张局势。
    说是新动向，当然并不意味着在东南亚地区加剧紧张局势对美国来说是什么新的，而是意味着美国又一次把制造紧张局势的重点转移到东南亚地区来。美国这次的转移重点，是同它的维持欧洲紧张局势的政策正遭受到沉重的打击分不开的。大家知道，由于苏联在对德和约和柏林问题上的和平建议得到世界人民特别是欧洲人民的普遍拥护，由于北大西洋集团内部在德国问题上矛盾重重，美国在欧洲局势问题上正处于十分孤立和进退两难的地位。对于一向利用紧张局势进行备战活动的美帝国主义来说，在苏联的和平建议的基础上进行谈判，缓和欧洲紧张局势，它是于心不甘的；然而它又难以在众目睽睽之下公然抗拒缓和欧洲紧张局势的潮流。因此，美国打算在东南亚地区制造新的紧张局势来转移世人的视线，同时也利用东南亚的紧张局势去阻挠欧洲紧张局势的缓和。这个地区的紧张局势难以维持了，就到另一个地区去制造紧张局势；利用一个地区的新的紧张局势去制造另一个地区的紧张局势——这本是第二次世界大战结束以来美帝国主义维持国际紧张局势的惯技。
    当然，早在4月4日艾森豪威尔发表演说之前，美国的这一活动就积极开始了。譬如：唆使老挝王国的萨纳尼空亲美政府破坏日内瓦协议，假南越和泰国之手进行阴谋颠复柬埔寨王国政府，利用南越侵犯我国领土西沙群岛，等等。不过，艾森豪威尔的演说正式宣告了美国在今后一个时期将在东南亚地区展开更大规模的制造紧张局势的活动。他在演说中一开始就保证他“所表达的信念不会有任何含糊的地方”。的确，人们是可以毫不含糊地从他的演说中看出来。美国决心以南越和日本作为美国侵略和控制亚洲的左右两手。
    美国总统选择南越这个据他自己说“从宾夕法尼亚州的葛底斯堡到那里整整要绕地球半周”的地方，作为侵略亚洲的前进基地，并不是偶然的。南越是美国在亚洲大陆南部的战略要地，既可以北向威胁越南民主共和国和中国，并且也是它向柬埔寨和老挝进行渗入和侵略的起点。目前，美国不正是通过南越干涉和威胁柬埔寨的内政，步步加紧地控制老挝，唆使老挝撕毁日内瓦协议，逐步把老挝变成美国新的军事基地吗？当艾森豪威尔在他的演说中，津津有味地大谈其南越的战略地位的重要性，并且说什么“如果南越为共产党人所攫取……东南亚其余国家就会受到大包抄行动的威胁”的时候，人们禁不住会想起中国的一句俗话：“夫子自道”。就在艾森豪威尔演说后的两天，美国的一万二千名海军和海军陆战队在美国加利福尼亚州南部的海岸举行登陆演习，而据合众国际社报道，登陆的地方被不偏不倚地“假想”为柬埔寨！对这样赤裸裸的军事侵略准备工作，难道还需要什么评论吗？
    艾森豪威尔以南越为例，强调说明了建立和维持一支当地的军事力量的必要性，据他说这样就可以避免“更大量地征召我们（指美国）的青年入伍”。这当然只能证明美国还死抱住“亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策不放。同时，艾森豪威尔也以南越为例，提出了他所谓的不发达国家经济发展的道路。据说一个不发达的国家是不能采取自力更生的办法（他把这说成是“从人民的饭碗中窃取”）来获得经济发展所必需的资金的，那样做了就是中国公社制度的“奴役办法”；而获取资金的唯一途径“是靠外来的私人投资，靠（外国）政府贷款，必要时还靠境遇比较好的其他国家的赠与”。这种荒谬而又愚蠢可笑的“理论”不过是更清楚地暴露了美帝国主义的打算：使南越这一类不发达国家（或者用艾森豪威尔的话来说，“整个非洲和南亚”）的经济完全依附于帝国主义，以便于对它们进行经济奴役和政治控制。
    美国向东南亚扩张的另一个打手，就是日本军国主义。日本潜在的帝国主义也力图借助美国的支持，积极向东南亚扩张势力。但是，在过去一个时期中，由于日本的“东南亚开发计划”，引起了东南亚各国的疑惧，而且也同美国本身的利益有矛盾，美国对日本的计划一直采取冷淡的态度。现在，一方面是由于美国的总的战略需要，另一方面也是由于日本岸信介政府在国内的地位岌岌可危，艾森豪威尔终于像日本共同社记者所说的：“下定决心，还要实现以日本为核心的东南亚开发计划”。
    实际上，美国是在“慷他人之慨”的前提下帮助日本向东南亚扩张以壮大日本军国主义的力量的。艾森豪威尔在他的演说中强烈暗示日本不得侵犯美国自己的市场，但同时却要求天然资源丰富的东南亚地区各国向日本提供原料，也要求“西方的每一个工业国家”的市场向日本开门。据各方消息报道，美国出席“东南亚条约组织”惠灵顿会议代表狄龙的主要任务之一就是，迫使“东南亚条约组织”各国对日本的东南亚开发计划采取合作态度。
    美帝国主义这种积极帮助日本向东南亚实行经济扩张的阴谋，对东南亚各国人民的和平和安全是一个严重的威胁。谁都知道，经济扩张不过是军事侵略的前奏；日本帝国主义当年所鼓吹的“大东亚共荣圈”和它所带来的灾祸，东南亚各国人民还是记忆犹新的。
    艾森豪威尔已经发出了信号，惠灵顿会议在美国代表的主持下也正在积极部署向东南亚地区进行新的侵略活动。紧张局势的乌云将又一次笼罩在东南亚地区的上空，各国人民特别是东南亚各国的人民必须提高警惕，团结起来，粉碎美国的侵略计划，维护亚洲的和平和安全。
