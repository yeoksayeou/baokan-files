Title: Why Are They So Busy?

    Everyone's eyes are on India,
    Why are some Indians so busy?
    Ignoring their own affairs, meddling in neighboring countries,
    Have they forgotten the "Panchsheel"?
    Tibet is forever a part of China,
    Quelling the rebellion is the desire of millions of Tibetans.
    The rebels are covered in blood,
    But they are only bringing destruction upon themselves.
    This matter is inherently just and proper,
    No need for anyone to stir up trouble.
    To try to engage in despicable schemes here,
    Unless one's mind is somewhat insane.
    Don't misjudge the situation, following the West,
    Nothing can allow you to "expand."
    Lifting a rock only to drop it on your own foot,
    That is a consequence you will have brought upon yourself!

    他们为何这样忙？
    楼适夷
    大家的眼睛都向印度望，
    有些印度人，为何这样忙？
    家务事不管，去管邻邦，
    “潘查希拉”难道都遗忘？
    西藏永远是中国的地方，
    平乱是百万藏人的愿望。
    叛乱分子满手染着血，
    原不过是在自取灭亡。
    这件事情本来正正当当，
    用不着请谁来兴风作浪。
    想在这点搞些卑鄙勾当，
    除非是头脑有点疯狂。
    可别估错形势，追随西方，
    没有什么能够让你“扩张”。
    搬起石头砸坏自己的脚，
    那是你自找的下场！
