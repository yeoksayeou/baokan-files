　　Ensure Early and Rapid Seedling Growth and Prevent Third-Class Rice Seedlings
　　Foshan Prefecture Increases Application of Base Fertilizer in Rice Fields

　　Guangzhou, April 17th (report from our newspaper) – Firmly eliminating blank fields before transplanting seedlings, and striving for fertilizer in every field and sufficient fertilizer per mu, are effective measures taken by Foshan Prefecture, Guangdong Province, to ensure early and rapid growth of seedlings after transplanting into the main fields and to prevent the appearance of "third-class rice seedlings."
    According to last year's experience, insufficient base fertilizer in the main fields is the fundamental reason for slow recovery and poor growth of seedlings after transplanting, leading to the so-called "third-class rice seedlings." Therefore, this year, during the inspection and comparison campaign before early rice transplanting in various parts of Foshan Prefecture, the base fertilizer in the main fields was given prominent and thorough field-by-field and plot-by-plot inspection. During the inspection, it was found that many distant fields and non-basic fields had insufficient base fertilizer, and some even had no base fertilizer at all. After the inspection, various localities immediately launched a campaign to eliminate blank fields by summarizing the experiences and lessons learned from the appearance of "third-class rice seedlings" last year and mobilizing the masses. A total of 560,000 laborers were organized throughout the prefecture to take charge of shock fertilizer delivery and contract to eliminate blank fields. In order to improve work efficiency, the following measures were also taken in various localities: First, for blank fields far from villages, "expedition teams" were organized to accumulate and produce fertilizer on the spot to reduce the labor wasted in long-distance transportation; second, roads were repaired to realize the mechanization of fertilizer transportation. After realizing one ox and one cart and one person and one cart for fertilizer transportation, Tonghu Commune in Huiyang County increased the daily fertilizer transportation volume from 1.28 million dan to 11.74 million dan; third, a mass fertilizer production campaign was launched to improve fertilizer efficiency and reduce the workload of fertilizer transportation. Huaxian County applied pond mud, old wall mud, and peat soil mixed with human and animal manure for five to seven days before sending it to the fields. Although the amount of fertilizer delivered was the same, the fertilizer effect was greatly improved; fourth, large-scale field manure pits were built to accumulate and produce fertilizer on the spot. At present, more than 400,000 field manure pits have been dug throughout the prefecture; in some places, pig pens have also been moved near the fields to provide feed and deliver fertilizer to the fields on the spot. By the end of March, sufficient or increased base fertilizer had been applied to 4.46 million mu of the prefecture's 5 million mu of early rice fields. Currently, the prefecture still maintains 200,000 laborers who are transplanting seedlings while delivering fertilizer during the busy season. (Zhou Fangyang)

　　保证秧苗早生快发不出三类禾
　　佛山专区增施稻田基肥
    本报广州17日电　坚决在插秧前消灭空白田，力争田田有肥，亩亩足肥，这是广东省佛山专区为了保证秧苗移植本田后早生快发，防止“三类禾”出现所采取的有效措施。
    根据去年的经验，本田基肥不足，是秧苗移植本田后回青慢、生势差，即出现所谓“三类禾”的根本原因。因此，今年佛山专区各地在早稻插秧前的检查评比运动中，突出地对本田基肥进行了逐丘逐块的检查。在检查中，发现不少远田和非基本田基肥不足，有的甚至没有下基肥。检查后，各地立即通过总结去年出现“三类禾”的经验教训，发动群众，开展消灭空白田运动。全区共组织了五十六万个劳动力，负责突击送肥，包干消灭空白田。为了提高工作效率，各地还采取了如下的措施：第一，对远离村庄的空白田，组织“远征队”，就地积肥制肥，以减少长途往返运肥所耗费的劳动力；第二，抢修道路，实现运肥车子化。惠阳县潼湖公社在实现一牛一车和一人一车运肥后，每天运肥量由一百二十八万担跃进到一千一百七十四万担；第三，开展全民制肥运动，以提高肥效来减少运肥工作量。花县把塘泥、旧墙泥和泥炭土加上人畜粪尿堆沤五至七天后，然后送下田，同样送一担肥，但肥效则大大提高；第四，大搞田头粪坑，就地积肥，就地制肥。现在全区已挖田头粪坑四十多万个；有的地方还把猪栏搬到田头附近，就地供应饲料，就地送肥下田。到3月下旬止，在全区五百万亩早稻田中，有四百四十六万亩已下足了基肥或增加了基肥。目前，全区还保持有二十万个劳力在插秧大忙中实行边插秧边送肥。　（周方暘）
