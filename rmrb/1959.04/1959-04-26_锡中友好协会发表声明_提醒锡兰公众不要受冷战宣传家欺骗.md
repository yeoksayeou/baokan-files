Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, April 24th: The Ceylon-China Friendship Association issued a written statement to the press here today, emphasizing that Tibet is an indivisible part of Chinese territory, and urged the Ceylonese public not to be deceived by Cold War propagandists.

The statement said: "In view of the fact that certain organizations and individuals in Ceylon intend to use the actions taken by the Central People's Government of China to quell the rebellion in Tibet to damage the friendly relations between Ceylon and the People's Republic of China, the Ceylon-China Friendship Association, which aims to promote friendly relations between our two countries, hopes that the people of Ceylon will not be deceived by Cold War propagandists and will not take any actions that would harm the development of friendship between China and Ceylon."

The statement said: "Tibet has always been recognized as an indivisible part of China, composed of various ethnic groups. The agreement reached on May 23, 1951, between the local government of Tibet and the Chinese Central People's Government stipulates: 'According to the policy on nationalities stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Tibetan people have the right to exercise national regional autonomy under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government.'"

The statement added: "The agreement reached in 1951 stipulates that the policy of freedom of religious belief stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will be implemented. Those of us who have been to China and seen the people of People's China fully enjoying freedom of religious belief are fully convinced that this policy is strictly observed."

The statement finally called on the Ceylonese people to take an objective view of the situation and not to take any action that might damage the friendly relations between the two countries.

    锡中友好协会发表声明
    提醒锡兰公众不要受冷战宣传家欺骗
    新华社科伦坡24日电　锡中友好协会今天在这里向报界发表的书面声明中强调指出，西藏是中国领土的不可分割的一部分，它要求锡兰公众不要受冷战宣传者的欺骗。
    声明说：鉴于锡兰某些组织和个人打算利用中国中央人民政府为平定西藏叛乱而采取的行动来损害锡兰和中华人民共和国之间的友好关系，以促进我们两国之间的友好关系为宗旨的锡中友好协会希望锡兰人民不要受冷战宣传者的欺骗，不要作出任何有损锡中两国之间的友谊的发展的事来。
    声明说：“西藏一直被承认是由各民族组成的中国的不可分割的一部分，西藏地方政府同中国中央人民政府在1951年5月23日达成的协议规定：‘按照中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领所规定的民族政策，在中央人民政府的统一领导下西藏人民有行使民族区域自治的权利’”。
    声明又说：“在1951年达成的协议中规定，将实行中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领所规定的宗教信仰自由的政策。我们中间到过中国的人，看到人民中国的人民充分的享受宗教信仰的自由以后完全相信，这项政策是被严格遵守的。”
    声明最后要求锡兰人民对局势采取客观的看法，并且不要作出任何可能损害两国友好关系的行动。
