Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 23rd: Many people close to the Dalai Lama here have used a large number of conclusive facts to expose the specific circumstances of the rebels' hijacking of the Dalai Lama. These facts prove that the claim that the Dalai Lama left Lhasa "of his own free will, and was not kidnapped" is completely fabricated.

　　Tsechong Gyuma (Note: Tsechong means the Dalai Lama's disciple, Gyuma is the name of a monk official) Lobsang Dorje, participated in a meeting held by the rebel leader Kündeling Dzasa in the Norbulingka scripture hall on March 10th. According to Lobsang Dorje's revelation, the rebel elements decided to control the Dalai Lama at that meeting. Lobsang Dorje said: "At that time, the meeting made the following decisions: First, the Dalai Lama cannot walk around at will except for the upper and lower temples and Dakun Temple; second, for the Dalai Lama's 'safety', in addition to Gusong Daiben, government officials and 'People's Volunteers' will be added as guards, stationed in Norbulingka, and a command will be established with Magike Könchok · Shekuppa as the commander-in-chief (called the executive commander). The powers of the headquarters are proposed by Kündeling Dzasa.” Lobsang Dorje said that since that meeting, the Dalai Lama has completely lost his freedom.

　　Könchok Tubten Dampa (Könchok is the name of a monk official, fourth rank), a pseudo-"People's Representative" who participated in the Lhasa rebellion, recounted the Dalai Lama's speech to the rebels in Norbulingka on March 14. From the Dalai Lama's speech, it was once again confirmed the situation and mood described in his three personal letters to General Tan Guansan, and it also showed that he was unwilling to leave his motherland for India at that time.

　　Tubten Dampa said: "On the 5th day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar (March 14th in the Gregorian calendar), Kalön, Chungyik Ch'ing-po (Note: Equivalent to the Chief Secretary of the original Tibetan local government's Secretariat), Tsipön (Note: Officials of the original Tibetan local government's personnel audit department, with higher power than officials of general organs of the original Tibetan local government), standing representatives of the 'People's Congress' (referring to the traitorous organization of the rebels), representatives of the three major monasteries and various troops (referring to the rebel army) were ordered to listen to the Dalai Lama's speech. The Dalai Lama began by talking about his own decision to go to the military region to watch a play. Then, the Dalai Lama said: "The matter of watching the play was discussed by myself and the central government officials, and it was not approved by anyone else. You are causing trouble, killing people and shedding blood, throwing stones at Kalön Sampo, etc., which makes me sad in all aspects. Moreover, meetings were held in the chanting hall on the 1st and 2nd (Note: This is the Tibetan calendar, namely March 10th and 11th in the Gregorian calendar). I once told you through Kalön, Chungyik Ch'ing-po, and Tsipön not to hold meetings. If you still want to hold meetings here, it is not allowed. The guard troops of the Khampa people (Note: refers to the rebels from the Kham area who surrounded Norbulingka) are also unnecessary."

　　Tubten Dampa said that at that time, the Dalai Lama also said: "Don't listen to the instigation of evil people's bad words and rumors, be calm. Now the Khampa troops in Norbulingka are firing their guns, and there are whistling bullets around my residence, and my life is in danger." The Dalai Lama then said: "Some people may think it would be better for me to go to India. This approach is only for personal comfort. I have been to Yadong before, and I also went to India the year before last. It is impossible to live there. I just want to enjoy karma on my own land."

　　Tubten Dampa said: "Judging from the subsequent development of the situation, the rebels simply did not take the Dalai Lama's instructions seriously and completely violated the Dalai Lama's instructions."

　　The Dalai Lama's guard, Pema Chömpel, also revealed: "On the 5th day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar (March 14th), Sokang, Lhukangwa, Shasur, Phala and other thirty or forty rebel leaders held a meeting in the Dalai Lama's new palace living room in Norbulingka. At that time, I was maintaining order at the entrance of the venue. At the meeting, the Dalai Lama said to everyone: ‘Going to the military region to watch a play on the 1st day of the second month (March 10th) was not at the invitation of the military region, but was proposed by myself to the military region, because the cultural troupe has studied in the mainland for several years and learned a lot of new things, and I wanted to see it. It was originally said to be in the first month (Tibetan calendar), but because the prayer festival was changed to the beginning of the second month (Tibetan calendar), the time was decided by me, but you surrounded me and prevented me from going. What you did is very bad, and I feel very uncomfortable.’"

　　Pema Chömpel also said: "After the 1st day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar, the four gates of Norbulingka were tightly closed, leaving only side doors for entry and exit. The side door was guarded by rebels, and no outsiders were allowed to enter. During this period, the Dalai Lama could only walk around in his own courtyard and could not go outside the courtyard. Before this, he often went out to play."

　　Pema Chömpel said: "At that time, the Dalai Lama's diet was also greatly reduced compared to before. In the past, when he met people in the courtyard, he often talked to them. Since he was placed under house arrest by the rebels, he no longer spoke to people when he saw them."

　　According to Jicun Gongjue (the servant of the Dalai Lama's younger brother, the Ali Living Buddha) and Tubten Wangdan (the person who conveyed the Dalai Lama's orders), once someone went to ask the Dalai Lama's mother what to do if the reactionaries wanted grass and grain. The Dalai Lama's mother complained at the time: "Give them whatever they want. The Dalai Lama has no power, so what power do we have? As long as they don't kill you, that's all."

　　They also said: The Dalai Lama's mother seemed a little panicked during this period. She often said: "The Dalai Lama has no power and freedom now, it's terrible, what should we do?"

　　The servant Jicun Gongjue also said that when the Dalai Lama was kidnapped, his mother's face changed. He said to Jicun Gongjue: "Now Lhasa is going to fight. We are afraid of gunshots, and the Dalai Lama's actions are not free." She told Jicun Gongjue: "If we don't come back, you go back to Drepung Monastery."

    拉萨许多接近达赖喇嘛的人列举事实证实
    叛乱分子劫持达赖喇嘛无法抵赖
    所谓达赖喇嘛出于自己意志离开拉萨的说法纯是鬼话
    新华社拉萨23日　电此间许多接近达赖喇嘛的人用大量确凿的事实，揭露叛乱分子劫持达赖喇嘛的具体情况，这些事实，证明所谓达赖喇嘛离开拉萨是“出于他自己的自由意志，而不是被劫持”的说法，完全是捏造。
    孜仲居玛（按：孜仲是达赖喇嘛子弟的意思，居玛是僧官名）洛桑多吉，曾在3月10日参加了叛乱头子功德林扎萨在罗布林卡诵经堂召开的一次会议。据洛桑多吉揭露，叛乱分子在那次会上就决定控制达赖喇嘛了。洛桑多吉说：“当时会上曾有这样的决定：第一、达赖喇嘛除上下两殿和大昆寺以外，不能随意行走；第二、为达赖喇嘛
  ‘安全’计，除古松代本以外，另增添政府官员和‘人民志愿军’为警卫军，驻扎罗布林卡，并组织指挥部由马基堪穷·雪苦巴等为总指挥（称为常务司令）。关于总指挥部的职权，由功德林扎萨提出。”洛桑多吉说，从那次会议以后，达赖喇嘛就完全失去自由了。
    曾经参加拉萨叛乱的伪“人民代表”、堪穷土登丹巴（堪穷是僧官名，四品），叙述了达赖喇嘛3月14日在罗布林卡向叛乱分子讲话的经过。从达赖喇嘛的讲话中，再一次证实了他给谭冠三将军三封亲笔信中所叙述的那种处境和心情，而且表明当时他是不愿离开自己的祖国到印度去的。
    土登丹巴说：“藏历2月5日（即公历3月14日），噶伦、仲译清波（按：相当于原西藏地方政府秘书处的大秘书）、孜本（按：即原西藏地方政府所属的主管人事审计部门的官员，权力比原西藏地方政府所属一般机关的官员为高）、“人民会议”常务代表（指叛乱分子的叛国组织）、三大寺和各部队（指叛军）代表奉命去听达赖喇嘛讲话。达赖喇嘛开始谈了他本人决定去军区看戏一事的过程。随后，达赖喇嘛说：“关于看戏的事是我自己和中央官员谈的，并未经过其他人。你们闹事，杀人流血，向噶伦桑颇打石头等，各方面都使我伤心。而且1日和2日（按：这是藏历，即公历3月10日和11日）还在念经佛堂开会，我曾经通过噶伦、仲译清波、孜本告诉不要开会，如还要在此开会，便不可以了。西康人的警卫部队（按：指包围罗布林卡的从西康地区来的叛匪）等也不必要”。
    土登丹巴说，当时达赖喇嘛还说：“不要听信恶人坏语、谣言的挑拨，要稳重。现罗布林卡内西康人部队枪支走火，在我住所前后均有嘶嘶的子弹声，我已到了性命难保之时。”达赖喇嘛接着说：“有些人可能认为我到印度去为好，这种作法只能是为了个人的安乐，以前我去过亚东，前年也去过印度，住在那边是不行的，我只想在自己的土地上享受因果。”
    土登丹巴说：“从后来的事态发展来看，叛乱分子根本不把达赖喇嘛的指示当作一回事，完全违背了达赖喇嘛的指示”。
    达赖喇嘛的警卫员白玛穷培也揭露说：“藏历2月5日（即3月14日），索康、柳霞、夏苏、帕拉等三、四十个叛乱头子在罗布林卡达赖喇嘛的新宫客厅里开会，当时我在门口维持会场秩序。会上，达赖喇嘛对大家说：‘藏历2月1日（即3月10日）到军区看戏，不是军区请我的，而是我自己向军区提出来的，因为文工团在内地学习了几年，学了很多新的东西，我想去看看。原来说在1月（藏历），因为传召改在2月初（藏历），时间是我决定的，可是你们却把我包围起来，不让我去，你们这样做很不好，我心里感到很难受’。”
    白玛穷培还说：“藏历2月1日以后，罗布林卡四面大门紧闭，只留侧门出入。侧门口有叛匪看守，不准外人进入。达赖在这期间，只能在他自己住的院子里转转，不能到院子外边去。在这以前，他是经常出去玩的。”
    白玛穷培说：“那时达赖喇嘛的饮食也较前大为减少。以前他在院子里遇到人时，经常和人谈话，自从他被叛乱分子软禁以后，见到人也不说话了。”
    另据吉村公爵（达赖喇嘛的弟弟阿里活佛的佣人）和土丹旺丹（传达达赖喇嘛命令的人）说：有一次有人去请示达赖母亲，说反动分子要草要粮怎么办，达赖母亲当时抱怨说：“要啥给他们啥，达赖都没有权力，我们还有啥权？只要他们不把你杀掉就好了。”
    他们还说：达赖母亲在这段时间里表现有些发慌的样子，她常说：“达赖现在没有权力和自由了，真糟糕，怎么办？”
    佣人吉村公爵还说，达赖喇嘛被劫走时，他的母亲脸色都变了，他对吉村公爵说：“现在拉萨要打仗了，打枪我们害怕，达赖行动没有自由了。”她告诉吉村公爵：“如果我们不回来，你就回哲蚌寺去。”
