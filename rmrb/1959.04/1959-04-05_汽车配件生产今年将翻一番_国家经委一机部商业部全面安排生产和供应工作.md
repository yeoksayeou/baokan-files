Xinhua News Agency, April 4th. The State Economic Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Commerce recently jointly convened a meeting to comprehensively arrange the production and supply of automobile, tractor, and internal combustion engine parts nationwide. According to the arrangement, the total output value of these parts in 1959 will double compared to 1958, and the variety will increase by more than 650 types.

A portion of automobile, tractor, and internal combustion engine parts need to be replaced regularly. Therefore, the production of parts is related to the normal operation of these vehicles and machines. When arranging this year's production, the State Economic Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Commerce especially requested all regions to attach importance to the production of parts. Factories that originally manufactured these parts but later switched to other products are required to continue manufacturing these parts. If these factories have difficulties in resuming parts production, relevant departments should also arrange for other factories to carry out production. There are many brands of automobiles, tractors, and internal combustion engines currently in use in China, and parts cannot be interchanged. Some parts cannot yet be manufactured domestically. The State Economic Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Commerce believe that, on the one hand, the standardization and generalization of parts should be promoted; on the other hand, relevant factories should conduct trial production in a planned and step-by-step manner to meet the needs of all parties.

In order to do a good job in the supply of parts, the State Economic Commission has decided that the commercial departments should manage this work in a unified manner, requiring commercial departments in various regions to ascertain the needs, understand the models and quantities of various vehicles and machines, and the consumption quotas of parts, and provide relevant information to the industrial departments. When organizing the supply of parts, commercial departments in various regions should implement the principle of rational distribution and ensuring key needs. (Attached picture)

    汽车配件生产今年将翻一番
    国家经委一机部商业部全面安排生产和供应工作
    新华社4日讯　国家经济委员会、第一机械工业部和商业部最近联合召开会议，全面安排全国汽车、拖拉机、内燃机配件的生产和供应工作。根据安排的结果，1959年这些配件的生产总值将比1958年翻一番，品种将增加六百五十多种。
    汽车、拖拉机、内燃机有一部分配件需要经常更换。因此，配件的生产关系着这些车辆和机器的正常运行。经委、一机部和商业部在安排今年的生产时，特别要求各地重视配件的生产。要求原来制造这些配件后来改做其他产品的工厂继续制造这些配件。如果这部分工厂恢复配件生产有困难，有关部门也要安排另外的工厂进行生产。我国目前使用的汽车、拖拉机、内燃机牌号很多，零件不能互相替换，有些配件自己还不能制造。经委、一机部和商业部认为，一方面要提倡零件标准化、通用化；另一方面，有关工厂要有计划有步骤地进行试制，以满足各方面的需要。
    为做好配件的供应工作，经委决定要由商业部门把这项工作统一管理起来，要求各地商业部门摸清需要，了解各种车辆、机器的型号、数量和配件的损耗定额，向工业部门提供有关的资料。各地商业部门在组织配件供应时，要贯彻合理分配、保证重点的原则。（附图片）
