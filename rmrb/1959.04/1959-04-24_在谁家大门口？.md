At Whose Doorstep?
	Yi Heyuan

We have a saying in China: "A bad-hearted person finds it hard to go far, and a night bat fears the sun." This is quite fitting to describe the ugly behavior of the "Indian Express." This newspaper repeats the hackneyed tune of so-called "Chinese aggression against Tibet," clamoring that "India's responsibility is not just to grant asylum to the Dalai Lama, his relatives, and his entourage..." Not "just to grant asylum." What else do they want? It's clear to everyone at a glance. For example, Mehta, the leader of the Indian Praja Socialist Party, isn't he advocating for "complete freedom of action"? This, as the Indian "Free Press" justly points out, "means the right to conduct activities against China on Indian territory." But the "Indian Express" shamelessly bites back, accusing China of violating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, saying, "The country that was the first to sign the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with us is violating these principles right at our doorstep."

Who is engaging in those shady dealings at whose doorstep, violating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence? This needs to be clarified.

Did China interfere in India's internal affairs? No. Did China establish a spy center within its own territory specifically to engage in activities that undermine India? No. The matter is plainly evident: certain Indian expansionists are too enthusiastic about interfering in China's internal affairs, actively supporting the Tibetan rebel groups, calling them "patriots" and "heroes"; clamoring that "Tibet is an independent country,"妄想 attempting to separate Tibet from our country. This wasn't enough. The Dalai Lama was abducted to India, and then they enthusiastically incited people to draft a "statement" for him. When the Dalai Lama was unwilling to read the "statement," they engaged in some "persuasion" work. Apparently, the persuasion was ineffective, so officials from the Ministry of External Affairs had to personally step in, taking on the errand of distributing the English version of the pre-printed "statement." As for Kalimpong in India, it is a well-known fact that it is a command center for the Tibetan rebellion, a spy center for carrying out sabotage activities against China.

What does all this demonstrate? Can this be said that China is violating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence? On the contrary, it unequivocally demonstrates that in "the country that was the first to sign the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with us," there are indeed some people who are "violating these principles right at our doorstep."

"Black cloth cannot be used to tailor white clothes." Like the "Indian Express," any attempt to reverse right and wrong and bite back will be a futile exercise, further exposing their own ugly faces.

    在谁家大门口？
    易和元
    我国有句俗话：“坏心人难走四方，夜蝙蝠怕见太阳。”这用来形容“印度快报”的丑恶行径倒是很合适的。这家报纸重复着所谓“中国侵略西藏”的滥调，叫嚷什么“印度的责任不是给予达赖喇嘛、他的亲属和他的随行人员的避难权就完了……”。不“就完了”。还要怎样？那是大家一看就知道的。例如印度人民社会党领袖梅达，不是就在鼓吹什么“完全的行动自由”吗？这就是印度“自由新闻”公正地指出的“意味着有权在印度领土上进行反对中国的活动”。 可是“印度快报”却恬不知耻地反噬中国违反五项原则，说什么“同我们第一个签订五项和平原则的那个国家就在我们大门口违反这些原则。”
    是谁在谁家的大门口干着那些不可告人的勾当，违反五项和平原则？这倒是要弄清楚的。
    是中国干涉了印度的内政？没有。是中国在自己的领土内成立了间谍中心专门从事破坏印度的活动？没有。事情摆得明明白白的是：某些印度扩张主义分子，太热心于干涉中国的内政，积极支持西藏叛乱集团，说他们是“爱国者”，是“英雄”；叫嚷什么“西藏是独立国家”，妄想把西藏从我们国家内分割出去。这还不够，达赖喇嘛被劫持到印度了，又热心地策动人去为他起草“声明”，当达赖喇嘛不愿宣读“声明”时，又进行什么“说服”工作，大约说服无效，外交部的官员只好亲自出马，担任散发事先印好的“声明”的英文本的差使。至于印度的噶伦堡，是指挥西藏叛乱，是向中国进行破坏活动的间谍中心，那更是人所周知的事了。
    这一切说明什么呢？这难道能说是中国在违反五项和平原则？相反，它倒是千真万确地说明了“同我们第一个签订五项和平原则的国家”里，确实有那么一些人“就在我们大门口违反这些原则。”
    “黑布裁不了白衣”，像“印度快报”那样，要想颠倒是非，反口噬人，只是枉费心机，更加暴露他们自己的丑恶面貌罢了。
