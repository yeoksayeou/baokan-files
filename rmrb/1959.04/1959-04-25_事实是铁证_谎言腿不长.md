Since the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government signed the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet in 1951, the Central Government has consistently adhered to the policies of national reunification, ethnic unity, ethnic equality, and gradual realization of national regional autonomy in Tibet, as well as the gradual implementation of democratic reforms. The People's Liberation Army troops and personnel stationed in Tibet have consistently adhered to discipline, cherished the people, respected local religious beliefs and customs, and taken active measures to promote the economic and cultural development of Tibet.

Facts are ironclad proof. The People's Liberation Army and personnel stationed in Tibet have been deeply supported and loved by the broad masses of the Tibetan people for the past eight years. The various rumors and slanders made by a small handful of traitorous elements from the former Tibetan local government and foreign reactionaries against the People's Liberation Army and personnel stationed in Tibet are completely unfounded.

    事实是铁证　谎言腿不长
    从1951年中央人民政府和西藏地方政府签订了和平解放西藏的十七条协议以后，中央对西藏一贯地坚持祖国统一、民族团结、民族平等和逐步实现民族区域自治，逐步实现民主改革的政策。进驻西藏的人民解放军部队和工作人员，一贯严守纪律，爱护人民，尊重当地的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，采取积极措施扶助西藏的经济和文化的发展。
    事实是铁证，进藏人民解放军和工作人员八年来一直深受广大西藏人民的拥护和爱戴，而一小撮原西藏地方政府的叛国分子和外国反动派，对进藏人民解放军和工作人员所进行的各种造谣诽谤是完全没有根据的。（附图片）
