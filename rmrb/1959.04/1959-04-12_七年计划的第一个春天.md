The First Spring of the Seven-Year Plan
By our reporter Cui Yongchang

The spring of 1959 has arrived on the land of the Soviet state, the first spring of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for communist construction.

Now, as cherry blossoms are in full bloom and the city is fragrant in Ashgabat, the capital of the Turkmen Republic, the fertile land on the Kuban River is once again emitting the fragrance of the fields. Teams of tractors are turning them over, sowing seeds, while in the remote northern regions and Siberia, it is still covered in white snow. But even there, people still feel a warmth of spring in their hearts, because the cause of communist construction has never developed as vigorously as it does today, and the youthful spirit of communism has never been as strong as it is today.

It has been more than two months since the 21st Congress of the CPSU closed, and now the people of the Soviet Union have launched a vigorous labor competition movement under the call of the Party. The slogan they put forward is "Complete the Seven-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule." This movement includes all sectors of industry and has been extended to all collective farms. Everywhere and in every sector, slogans such as "Complete the Seven-Year Plan One Year Ahead of Schedule," "Complete the Seven-Year Plan in Four or Five Years!", and "Complete the Seven-Year Plan in Three Years" have been put forward. Kursky, a worker from Sverdlovsk, simply and clearly expressed the feelings of the Soviet people, saying, "The beautiful prospects of communism are so exciting us that every worker's hands are burning with the desire to do more work!"

Shock Workers on the Industrial Front

As soon as the 21st Congress of the CPSU closed, the people fighting on the industrial front, inspired by the seven-year plan, immediately launched a labor competition movement. The first to come forward to challenge was the Belousov Communist Labor Team of Coal Mine No. 1 in Sverdlovsk, Voroshilovgrad Oblast. In their challenge letter published in the newspaper, they wrote: "When we studied the documents of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, we paid special attention to the following sentence in Comrade Khrushchev's report: 'Every worker should adopt advanced labor methods in industry and agriculture, and make better use of the machines they operate – machine tools, units, tractors, combine harvesters – in order to produce more products of high quality and low price.' In this spirit, we have revised our guarantees and decided to complete the seven-year plan for the work team in five years, and to produce 82,000 tons of coal above the plan in these five years." This challenge letter, after being published in the newspaper, immediately received a warm response from workers across the country. The first to respond was the oil workers of Bashkir, who pledged that 1959 is the first year of the seven-year plan, and this year's production plan is of great significance for the next six years. Therefore, they proposed the slogan of striving to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule, and guaranteed to produce 150,000 tons of oil, 3 million cubic meters of gas, and 150,000 tons of oil products for the country this year. In addition, they will discover at least seven new oil fields for the country.

After these two challenge letters were published, workers in various places and departments held meetings to respond and put forward their own guarantees. For example, in the machine manufacturing industry, workers in Leningrad guaranteed to promote technological innovation and complete the plan for manufacturing new machines ahead of schedule. Construction workers and designers in Krasnoyarsk Krai proposed to fully supply building materials and complete the design of various new construction projects ahead of schedule….

All industrial sectors in the Soviet Union have been swept into a surge of striving to complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule. This high labor enthusiasm makes this year's spring particularly brilliant.

Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Advance Side by Side

The Soviet seven-year plan has set huge tasks in both agriculture and animal husbandry. By 1965, the Soviet Union will produce 10 to 11 billion poods of grain, 5.7 to 6.1 million tons of cotton; meat production will double to 16 million tons, and milk production will increase by 70% to 80%. Such a production plan has been warmly welcomed by the people of the whole country, bringing the competition for vigorous increase in livestock products, which has been unfolding since the end of last year, to a new climax.

The plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU in December last year summarized the experience of the great development of agriculture in the past five years, and put forward new calls to agricultural producers across the country. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his report at the December plenary session that in 1958, the Soviet Union had caught up with the United States in terms of total output of milk and animal oil; it was also close to the United States in terms of per capita calculation, and could greatly exceed the United States in the next few years. However, great efforts are needed in meat production, and it is proposed that to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita meat production, it is necessary to produce 20 to 21 million tons of meat annually.

The call of the December plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the seven-year plan for advancing towards communism gave the Soviet agricultural workers great encouragement. Unable to contain their excitement, they put forward bold production increase plans and heroic competition slogans. The first to come forward to challenge was the entire agricultural workforce of Ryazan Oblast in the Russian Federation, who put forward the resounding slogan: to increase meat production by 2.8 times in 1959, and to complete the Ryazan Oblast's seven-year meat production plan in two or three years. This courageous initiative immediately received the support of livestock workers from all over the country, who also learned from the example of Ryazan Oblast and put forward their own targets based on their own conditions and possibilities. For example, Kuban proposed that the seven-year plan for meat and milk should also be completed in three years. In 1959, they would produce 420,000 tons of meat for the country, an increase of 80% compared with 1958.

After the 21st Congress of the CPSU, this movement developed more widely and deeply. For example, Ukraine, one of the important agricultural regions of the Soviet Union, decided to complete the republic's seven-year plan for agricultural production in five years. The seven-year plan stipulates that by 1965, Ukraine should produce 2.1 billion poods of grain, 40 million tons of sugar beets, meat production should increase by 90%, and milk production should increase by 90% to 100% annually. At the end of February, Ukraine convened a conference of advanced agricultural producers. At the conference, production experts from all over the country unanimously passed a resolution to realize this seven-year plan two years ahead of schedule, and set production targets for this year.

Kazakhstan, the Soviet Union's new granary, is not far behind. They stipulate that by the end of the seven-year plan, the republic's total annual grain harvest should be no less than 1.37 billion poods, and meat production should increase to about 1.25 million tons. However, the people of Kazakhstan, encouraged by the bright prospects of the seven-year plan, studied their potential and put forward a heroic guarantee that they would increase the total output of grain to 1.5 billion poods in one year this year! The seven-year plan for meat production was also decided to be completed in 1963.

The Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, famous for its cotton production, also decided to complete the seven-year plan for cotton production in six years, and the milk production plan in three years. All other union republics have also put forward similar guarantees.

From these moving facts, we can see how much labor enthusiasm the seven-year plan has aroused among Soviet agricultural workers. Like the workers, Soviet agricultural workers will contribute their strength to the country's communist construction cause.

The Dawn of Communism

It is no accident that the Soviet seven-year plan is called the seven-year plan for communist construction. Indeed, in today's Soviet Union, many new things are emerging here.

The movement to strive to become communist labor teams, which was born on the eve of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, is now developing more deeply. This movement has only been around for a few months since its birth, but it has already blossomed all over the Soviet Union. From the slogans put forward by these work teams: "Work, live, and study in the spirit of communism," we can see what scale the Soviet people use to demand of themselves. This scale is the communist spirit. Collectivism, high loyalty to the cause of communism, extensive knowledge, mastery of one's own professional skills, and noble communist morals are the demands of the Soviet people on themselves. For example, Chu Zshanlov, a worker in the machine shop of the Moscow Ilich factory, can operate any lathe in the workshop. After finishing his work, he also studies at the school for young workers. When everyone proposed to strive to become a "communist labor team," his own plan was: to complete the seven-year quota in five years at work, and to graduate from the mechanical manufacturing specialty college in five years; to reach the level of foreman of milling, drilling, and turning in terms of technology. Siminsky, a famous lathe worker in Kiev, also guaranteed to put forward one hundred rationalization proposals in seven years, and strive to save the country 500,000 rubles of funds.

In many factories in the Soviet Union, the boundaries between workers and technicians are increasingly shortening. Many engineers and technicians were all workers yesterday, and today's ordinary workers will also be tomorrow's engineers due to hard study. This feature will undoubtedly continue to develop in the process of further automation and mechanization of production. The difference between mental and physical labor can be said to be increasingly blurred. For example, many factories in Moscow have installed automated production lines. It is difficult to say whether the workers who manage these production lines are physical or mental laborers, because although their labor seems to be only pressing a button and adjusting the machine, they need to have advanced technical knowledge to repair it when the production line goes wrong.

1959, the beginning of the seven-year plan, is an era full of new things. One of the most meaningful of these new things is that cultural universities have recently been opened in the cultural palaces of many factories and collective farms. In these cultural palaces, workers or collective farm members, after a day's work, enter the brightly lit halls and systematically study knowledge of literature and art.

The Soviet people are moving forward enthusiastically in the first spring of the period of comprehensively launching the construction of a communist society!

### 七年计划的第一个春天

　　七年计划的第一个春天
　　本报记者　崔永昌
    1959年的春天来到了苏维埃国家的大地，这是苏联共产主义建设七年计划的第一个春天。
    现在，当土库曼共和国的首都阿什哈巴德已经樱花怒放、满城花香的时候，库班河上肥沃的土地重新发出了田野的芳香，一队队拖拉机把它们翻了过来，撒下种子，而在遥远的北部地区和西伯利亚却仍然是白雪皑皑，但是就在那里，人们在心头上仍然感到一种春天的温暖，因为共产主义的建设事业从来没有发展得像今天这样蓬蓬勃勃，共产主义的青春气息从来没有像今天这样浓郁。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会闭幕已经两个多月了，现在苏联全国人民在党的号召下已经展开了一个轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛运动，他们提出的口号是“提前完成七年计划”。这个运动不但包括了工业的所有部门，并且扩展到了所有的农庄。在各个地方和各个部门，都纷纷提出“提前一年完成七年计划”、“七年计划四年完成、五年完成！”、“七年计划三年完成”的口号。斯维德洛夫斯克的工人库尔斯基简单明了地说出了苏联人民的心情，他说：“共产主义事业的美好远景是这样地激动着我们，使得每个工人的双手全都为了想要多做些工作而发烫了！”
    工业战线上的突击手
    苏共第二十一次代表大会刚一闭幕，战斗在工业战线上的人们，在七年计划的鼓舞下，马上掀起了劳动竞赛运动，首先出来挑战的是顿巴斯卢布斯克州斯维德洛夫斯克一号煤矿的别洛乌索夫共产主义劳动队，他们在报上发表的挑战书中写道：“我们在学习苏共第二十一次代表大会文件的时候，特别注意到了赫鲁晓夫同志报告中的这样一句话：‘每一个劳动者都应该在工业和农业中采用先进的劳动方法，更好地使用自己所操使的机器——机床、机组、拖拉机、联合收割机，以便生产出更多的质量高、价格便宜的产品。’根据这种精神，我们重新修改了自己的保证，并决定把工作队的七年计划用五年的时间完成，在这五年内要超计划生产八万二千吨煤。”这一挑战书在报上发表以后，马上得到了全国工人的热烈响应。首先起来应战的是巴什基尔的石油工人，他们提出保证说，1959年是七年计划的第一年，今年的生产计划对于以后六年具有重要的意义，因此他们提出争取提前完成今年生产计划的口号，并且保证在今年一年内为国家超额生产十五万吨石油、三百万立方公尺煤气和十五万吨石油产品。除此以外他们还要为国家至少发现七个新的石油矿藏。
    这两个挑战书发表之后，各地各部门的工人纷纷集会响应，并提出了自己的保证。例如在机器制造业方面，列宁格勒的工人保证推行技术革新，提早完成制造新机器的计划。克拉斯诺雅尔斯克州的建筑工人和设计人员提出要充分供应建筑材料并提早完成各项新建设的设计工作……。
    苏联所有的工业部门都卷入了一个争取提前完成七年计划的热潮，这种高涨的劳动热情使得今年的春光格外灿烂。
    农业畜牧业比翼齐飞
    苏联七年计划在农业和畜牧业方面都制定了巨大的任务，到1965年时苏联将生产一百亿到一百一十亿普特粮食，五百七十万到六百一十万吨棉花；肉类增加一倍，达到一千六百万吨，奶类增产70％到80％。这样一个生产计划在全国人民中间受到热烈的欢迎，使从去年年底展开的争取大力增产畜产品的竞赛达到了新的高潮。
    去年12月苏共中央的全体会议总结了五年来农业大发展的经验，并且向全国农业生产者提出了新的号召。赫鲁晓夫同志在12月全会上的报告中指出，1958年苏联在奶类和动物油的总产量方面已经赶上了美国；在按人口平均计算上也接近了美国，并且在最近几年内就可以大大超过美国。但是在肉类生产上却需要作很大努力，并且提出要在按人口计算的肉类生产方面赶上美国，必须每年生产二千万到二千一百万吨肉类的任务。
    苏共中央12月全会的号召和向共产主义前进的七年计划，给了苏联农业工作者以巨大的鼓舞，他们按捺不住兴奋的心情，纷纷提出大胆的增产计划和豪迈的竞赛口号。首先起来挑战的是俄罗斯联邦梁赞州的全体农业工作者，他们提出了响亮的口号：1959年内使肉类生产增加二点八倍，用两三年的时间完成梁赞州的肉类七年生产计划。这一项勇敢的倡议马上得到了各地畜牧业工作者的支持，他们也学习梁赞州的榜样，根据自己的条件和可能提出了自己的指标。例如库班就提出肉类和奶类的七年计划也用三年完成，1959年内他们要为国家生产四十二万吨肉类，即比1958年增加80％。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，这个运动发展得更为广泛和深入了，例如苏联的重要农业区之一乌克兰，就决定把共和国的农业生产七年计划用五年完成。七年计划中规定乌克兰到1965年时每年应生产二十一亿普特粮食，四千万吨甜菜，肉类生产要增加90％，奶类要增加90％到100％。2月底乌克兰召开了先进农业生产者会议，在会议上来自各地的生产能手一致通过决议，要把这个七年计划提前两年实现，并且定出了今年的生产指标。
    苏联的新谷仓哈萨克斯坦也不甘落后，他们规定在七年计划结束时，这个共和国每年谷物总收获量要不少于十三亿七千万普特，肉产量要增加到一百二十五万吨左右。但是为七年计划美好前景所鼓舞的哈萨克人民研究了自己的潜力以后，提出了一项豪迈的保证，他们要在今年一年内把谷物的总产量提高到十五亿普特！肉类生产的七年计划也决定在1963年完成。
    以盛产棉花著名的塔吉克加盟共和国也决定把棉花生产的七年计划用六年时间完成，奶类的生产计划则用三年完成。其他的各个加盟共和国也都提出了类似的保证。
    从这些动人的事实中我们可以看到，七年计划在苏联农业工作者中间唤起了多么大的劳动热情，苏联农业工作者也像工人一样，他们要把自己的力量贡献给祖国的共产主义建设事业。
    共产主义的曙光
    苏联的七年计划被人们称作共产主义建设的七年计划并不是偶然的。的确，在今天的苏联，许多新鲜事物正在这里涌现出来。
    诞生在苏共第二十一次代表大会前夕的争取作共产主义劳动工作队的运动，现在发展得日益深入。这个运动从诞生到现在还不过几个月的时间，但是它已经在苏联全国遍地开花。从这些工作队提出的口号：“用共产主义的精神来工作、生活和学习”里面，可以看到苏联人民用怎样的尺度要求自己。这个尺度是共产主义精神。集体主义，对共产主义事业的高度忠诚，广泛的知识，精通自己的专业技术和高尚的共产主义品德，就是苏联人民对自己的要求。例如莫斯科伊里奇工厂机工车间的工人楚善洛夫，他可以操纵车间里的任何一部车床，工作完了之后还在青年工人学校学习，当大家提出争取做“共产主义劳动队”之后，他自己订的计划是：在工作上五年完成七年定额，五年后在机械制造专科大学毕业；在技术上达到铣工、钻工和旋工工长的水平。全苏出名的基辅市旋工席明斯基还保证在七年内提出一百件合理化建议，争取为国家节省五十万卢布资金。
    在苏联的许多工厂里，工人和技术人员的界限正在日益缩短，许多工程师、技术员全是昨天的工人，而今天的普通工人由于刻苦地学习也将是明天的工程师。这个特点在生产进一步自动化和机械化的过程中无疑地还将继续发展下去。脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别可以说愈来愈模糊了，例如莫斯科的许多工厂都安装了自动化作业线，看管这些作业线的工人，很难说他是体力劳动者还是脑力劳动者，因为他的劳动看起来虽只是按一按电钮，调节一下机器，但是当工作线出毛病时，他却需要有高等的技术知识才能进行修理。
    七年计划开端的1959年是一个充满新事物的年代。这些新事物中间的很有意义的一件是，最近许多工厂和集体农庄的文化宫开办了文化大学。在这些文化宫里，工人或集体农庄庄员在一天的劳动结束之后，走进灯火辉煌的大厅，有系统地学习文学艺术方面的知识。
    苏联人民在全面展开共产主义社会建设时期的第一个春天里正热情蓬勃地向前迈进！
