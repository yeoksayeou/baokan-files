　　Leading Every Month
    Liu Guangjin, a stoker at the Shijingshan Power Plant, has exceeded his leap forward plan for eighteen consecutive months as of March this year, consistently leading in the competition among the four shifts in his furnace team.

    Liu Guangjin keeps a very tight grip on his leap forward plan, focusing not only on a monthly and daily basis but also on an hourly basis. The quality of boiler production is mainly reflected in how much of the heat generated by burning coal in the boiler is effectively utilized versus how much is lost. This indicator needs to be calculated by determining the boiler's various heat losses. Most stokers calculate this at most once per shift, or don't calculate it at all, waiting to see the statistical department's reports. Liu Guangjin, however, measures the various heat losses of the boiler every hour, so before a shift is even over, he can estimate the boiler efficiency for his shift. If a particular heat loss is high in the previous hour, he immediately takes measures to reduce it in the next hour.

    Liu Guangjin said: "In production, one must be conscientious and meticulous, never allowing a few minutes of relaxation to affect an hour, or an hour of relaxation to affect a shift." During his eight-hour shift, he constantly circles the furnace, checking and adjusting at all times, keeping the fire surface in the furnace consistently level.

    When using low-quality coal, he vigorously promoted the "thick coal bed, large air volume" operating method. Now that the coal quality has changed, with a higher heat content, he has proposed and implemented a new combustion method of "thin coal bed, long fire surface," which has increased boiler efficiency from 87% to 89%. After this new operating method was推广 promoted on all six similar boilers in the plant, it can save the country several thousand tons of coal per year.

    Liu Guangjin is an old boiler worker with more than twenty years of experience, a Communist Party member who was promoted to deputy director of the boiler workshop at this plant after liberation. In September of the year before last, he voluntarily requested to be demoted to a stoker. He is determined to promote the work of the entire workshop by directly participating in production and setting an example. For more than a year, Liu Guangjin has fully realized the guarantee he made to the Party: exceeding the quota every month, leading every month, while ensuring safety. (Hua)

　　月月领先
    石景山发电厂司炉刘光金到今年3月已经连续十八个月超额完成跃进计划，在本炉四班的竞赛中始终领先。
    刘光金对自己的跃进计划抓得非常紧，他不但是按月、按日抓，而且是一个钟头一抓。锅炉生产的好坏，主要表现为锅炉中燃烧煤所发生的热量有多少被有效地利用，有多少跑掉了。这项指标是需要通过计算锅炉的各项热损失才能得出。一般的司炉，顶多一班算一次，或者自己根本不计算，等着看统计部门的表报。刘光金却对锅炉每个钟头的各项热损失都随时进行测算，因此一班还没有干完，他已经能够估算出他这一班的锅炉效率是多少。上一个钟头，那一项热损失大了，下一个钟头他就立即采取措施把它降下来。
    刘光金说：“在生产时要兢兢业业，一丝不苟，决不能因为几分钟的放松而影响一点钟，因为一个钟头的放松而影响一班”。他在一班八小时内，不停地围着炉子转，随时检查，随时调整，炉内火面经常保持平整。
    在用低质煤的时候，他大力推行“厚煤层、大风量”的操作方法。现在，煤质变化，含热量高了，他又提出并实行“薄煤层，长火面”的新的燃烧方法，使锅炉效率由87％提高到89％。这个新的操作方法在全厂六台同型锅炉上推广以后，一年可以为国家节约几千吨煤。
    刘光金是有二十多年工龄的老锅炉工人、共产党员，解放后曾被提拔担任这个厂锅炉车间的副主任。前年9月，他主动要求下放作司炉。他决心以直接参加生产、树立榜样的办法，来推动整个车间的工作。一年多来，刘光金完全实现了向党提出的保证：月月超额，月月领先，同时保证安全。　（华）
