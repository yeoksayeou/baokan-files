Xishui Promotes Good Seed Varieties with "Five Combinations"
Hubei Xishui County Agricultural Bureau

　　In recent years, the work of promoting good seed varieties in Xishui County has achieved great success under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and with the close cooperation of relevant departments. Especially after the reform of the cultivation system in 1957-1958, seven varieties of rice introduced from other places were promoted. 90% of the wheat was "Nanda 2419", and 10% was local good seed wheat, "Lushui Bai"; 95% of the rapeseed and 50% of the peanuts were planted with good seeds introduced from other places or local good seeds. The popularization of good seeds has played a significant role in increasing production. According to the survey in 1958, the selection of improved varieties can generally increase production by 10%-35%. If the cultivation techniques are up to par, the increase can be further increased by 70% or even several times. Through several years of seed work, we have the following points of experience:

　　Combining farm trials with multi-point demonstrations. The good seed varieties promoted in Xishui County, such as Dai Zi cotton, Japonica rice, and "Nanda 2419" wheat, were first tested on farms, achieving high yields and mastering the characteristics of the varieties, and then comprehensively promoted through multi-point trials. Taking the promotion of Shengli Xian good seed as an example, in 1950, the farm tested eight mu of Shengli Xian, with an average yield of 616 jin per mu, which was 10% higher than local varieties. Through field identification, Shengli Xian has the advantages of being early-maturing, neat, and insect-resistant, so it was decided to promote it throughout the county. In this way, in 1951, every township in the county planted two or three mu of Shengli Xian. After that, for five consecutive autumn harvests, a vigorous seed exchange movement was launched. Therefore, the promotion of Shengli Xian good seed quickly became one of the measures to increase rice production in Xishui County, with the area increasing from eight mu in 1950 to 420,000 mu in 1955. In recent years, our county's good seed promotion work has been very effective whenever we have done this, and problems have arisen when we have not done this. For example, in 1956, more than 20,000 mu of early Japonica Aomori No. 5 was introduced from other places without farm trials. Due to unfamiliarity with this early Japonica and the various changes caused by planting in different places, abnormal growth occurred, affecting the yield.

　　Combining the promotion of foreign varieties with the excavation of local good varieties. While introducing excellent varieties from other places, we must also pay attention to excavating local good varieties. Because local good varieties are selected by the local working people over a long period of time, they have a certain adaptability and various excellent characteristics. The characteristics of these varieties are familiar to the local masses, so they are easy to promote and can achieve good results. Before 1956, our guiding ideology was not clear enough on this issue. Some good local varieties and new varieties cultivated by the masses were almost squeezed out. "Rapeseed White" is a farmer variety in our county with a 20-year history of cultivation. We did not pay attention to this good seed in the past, and it was not promoted until the winter sowing of 1956. Due to the use of this variety, the rapeseed yield per mu in the county has changed significantly. There were similar situations in dealing with glutinous rice. This fact has made us deeply aware that the promotion of foreign good seed must be combined with the excavation of local good seed, and neglecting either side is wrong. Based on this experience, in 1958, we conducted a mass selection of all varieties and completed the variety collection work, discovering many good seeds.

　　Combining the popularization of good seeds with improving quality. While promoting good seeds, we must actively lead the masses to continuously select and cultivate seeds to maintain and improve the quality of good seeds. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this issue, only focusing on promotion and not on propagation, so that the good seeds have shown varying degrees of degradation and mixing. In 1957, we inspected the Jianxin Cooperative in Xinpu Township and found that there were seven or eight varieties mixed in one field. From the field identification of Tian'e Cooperative, the degradation of Shengli Xian variety was also very serious. This fact shows that no matter what good seed is, if it is not propagated, not only will the seeds be mixed, but also the original good seed characteristics will gradually degrade.

　　In response to this situation, we focus on both promotion and seed selection and good seed propagation in our seed work.

　　Combining good seed promotion with technology transfer. After good seeds are promoted, the characteristics and cultivation techniques of the good seeds should be introduced in detail to the promoted areas, so that the masses can master the key to increasing production and carry out operations. The scale of technology transfer should be determined according to the size of the promotion area. This is a matter of success or failure in the promotion of good seeds and cannot be ignored. Although the area for promoting Dai Zi cotton in our county has been expanding year by year, the progress is very slow and the yield is not high. The main reason is that the masses have not mastered the techniques of pest control and pruning of Dai Zi cotton. After several cotton technology exchange meetings in 1956 and 1957, summarizing the experience of increasing production and the lessons of reducing production, the technology of planting Dai Zi cotton was further promoted. The lint yield per mu in 1957 increased to more than 70 jin, which was double that of 1955 and two times that of 1953. The development of Shengli rapeseed in our county has been very slow. In four years, there were only 11,700 mu, accounting for 13% of the sown area. The main reason is that the characteristics and key points of increasing production of Shengli rapeseed have not been mastered by the masses. The promotion of late Japonica rice in our county has been carried out with a lot of work in technology transfer. From trial planting to comprehensive promotion, the area has been expanding year by year, and the yield per mu has been increasing rapidly.

　　Combining mass selection with regional identification. In recent years, we have felt that actively leading the masses to select good seeds and promote good seeds has played a certain role in increasing production. However, due to the excessive number of varieties, we cannot fully understand the good seeds, the promotion goals are not clear enough, the guidance is not specific, so that many seeds of poor quality are still retained, and some better varieties have not been discovered. In 1958, the county conducted a comprehensive selection on the basis of past seed collection. Through variety sorting, our minds were clear, we knew the distribution of each variety and the variety characteristics, and we found the basis for promotion. This work was done in 1958 and will continue in the future.

　　浠水推广良种的“五结合”
　　湖北浠水县农业局
    几年来，浠水县的良种推广工作，在各级党委的领导和有关部门的密切配合下，取得了很大的成绩。特别是1957—1958年在改革耕作制度以后，水稻方面推广了七个从外地引进的品种；小麦有90％是“南大二一四九”，10％是本地良种籽麦、露水白；95％的油菜和50％的花生，都种上了外地引进的良种或本地良种。良种普及的结果，在增产上起了显著作用。从1958年调查情况来看，选用优良品种一般能增产10％—35％，如果栽培技术跟得上，增产幅度还可以增加70％、甚至几倍。通过几年来的种子工作，我们有以下几点体会：
    农场试种和多点示范相结合。浠水县推广的岱字棉、粳稻、“南大二四一九”小麦等良种，都是首先从农场试种，获得了丰产并掌握品种特性，然后通过多点试种，再全面进行推广。仅以推广胜利秈良种为例，1950年农场试种了八亩胜利秈，每亩平均产量六百十六斤，比本地品种高出一成。通过田间鉴定，胜利秈具有早熟、齐整、抗虫等优点，便决定在全县推广它，这样，全县1951年每个乡都种上了二、三亩胜利秈。此后接连五个秋收，都展开热火朝天的换种运动。因此，推广胜利籼良种，很快就成为浠水县水稻增产措施之一，面积由1950年的八亩，逐年发展到1955年的四十二万亩。几年来，我县良种推广工作，凡是这样做的，效果都很好，没有这样作的，就出了问题。如1956年推广早粳青森五号，未经农场试种，就从外地引种了二万多亩。由于不熟悉这种早粳，异地种植而产生的种种变化，因而造成生长不正常，影响产量。
    推广外来品种和挖掘本地良种相结合。在由外地引进的优良品种的同时，还要重视挖掘本地的良种。因为本地良种是当地劳动人民长期选择出来的，有一定的适应性和各种优良特性。这些品种的特性都为当地群众所熟悉，因此容易推广，也能获得良好效果。这个问题，1956年以前，我们在指导思想上是不够明确的。有些好的本地良种和群众培育出来的新品种，险些被排挤掉。“油菜白”是我县农家品种，有二十年的栽培历史。这个良种，我们过去没有管它，1956年冬播才开始推广。由于采用了这个品种，全县油菜单产起了显著变化。在对待糯谷上也有类似情况。这个事实，使我们深刻地认识到：推广外地良种必须与发掘本地良种相结合，忽视任何一面都是不对的。根据这个经验，我们在1958年将所有品种进行了一次群众性的评选，完成了品种征集工作，发现了很多良种。
    良种普及和提高质量相结合。在推广良种的同时，要积极领导群众不断地进行选种和培育，来保持和提高良种的质量。我们过去对这个问题注意不够，只抓推广，没抓繁育，使良种已经出现不同程度的退化和混杂。1957年我们在新铺乡建新社检查，发现一丘田里混杂有七、八个品种。从天鹅社的田间鉴定来看，胜利秈品种的退化也很严重。这个事实说明，不论什么良种如果没有进行繁育，不仅种子混杂，而且原有的良种特性也会逐渐退化。
    针对这个情况，我们在种子工作上既抓住推广，又抓住选种和良种的繁育。
    推广良种和技术传授相结合。良种推广以后，紧接着要把良种的特性和栽培技术，向推广地区详细介绍，以便群众掌握增产关键，进行操作。技术传授的规模应根据推广面积的大小而定。这是关系到良种推广的成败问题，不可忽视。我县推广岱字棉的面积虽然逐年扩大，但是进展很慢，产量也不高。主要原因是岱字棉的除虫、整枝等技术没有被群众掌握。1956年和1957年通过几次棉花技术交流会，总结了增产经验和减产教训以后，种植岱字棉的技术得到进一步推广，1957年的皮棉提高到亩产七十多斤，比1955年提高一倍，比1953年翻两番。胜利油菜在我县发展速度很慢，四年来只有一万一千七百亩，占播种面积13％。主要原因也是胜利油菜的特性和增产关键，没被群众掌握。一季晚粳在我县推广，由于在传授技术上进行了很多工作，从试种到全面推广，面积逐年扩大，单产上升很快。
    群众评选和区域鉴定相结合。几年来我们感到，积极领导群众评选良种，推广良种，在增产上是起了一定的作用，但是由于品种过多，对良种不能全部摸底，推广目标不够明确，以致指导不具体，很多质量不好的种子，仍然被保留，有些较好的品种，却没发现。1958年全县在过去种子征集的基础上，进行了一次全面评选。通过品种整理，我们的头脑清醒了，知道了各个品种分布情况和品种性状，找到了推广的依据。这个工作1958年作了，今后还要继续进行。
