    Publish More Situation Maps
　　In the past, when the People's Daily published news and articles on international issues, it often included situation maps. This was very helpful to readers, and I hope that this practice will continue in the future. Here, I would like to point out that the important article published on the fifth page of the March 27th issue regarding the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement on the United States' signing of a military agreement with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan, unfortunately, did not include a situation map of this region. I hope attention will be paid to improvement.

    多刊登形势图
  　人民日报以往登载有关国际问题的消息和文章，经常附有形势地图。这对读者有很大的帮助，希望今后还能继续这样做下去。这儿我想提出，3月27日第五版登载了苏联外交部就美国同伊、土、巴签订军事协定发表声明的重要文章，可惜没有附上这个地区的形势图。希望注意改进。
