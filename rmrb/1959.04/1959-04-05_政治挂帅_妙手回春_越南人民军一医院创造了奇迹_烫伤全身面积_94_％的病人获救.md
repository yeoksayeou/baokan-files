Politics Takes Command, Skillful Hands Bring Recovery
Vietnam People's Army Hospital No. 1 Creates a Miracle
Patient with 94% of Body Burned is Saved

    Zhang Gongxian, a cook from a unit of the Vietnam People's Army, tripped while carrying boiling water. The entire bucket of boiling water poured over him, and 94% of his body was burned. Except for his eyes and hair, his entire body was covered in blisters.

    Zhang Gongxian was sent to the 104th Military Hospital. The surgeons immediately began emergency treatment, spending more than three hours washing and bandaging him. "Can this patient survive?" The doctors and nurses held an emergency on-site meeting in the operating room. Some said that according to medical books, it is very difficult to treat burns covering 40% of the body; with burns covering 55% of the body, the chances of survival are extremely slim. After discussion, they decided to overcome the difficulties and find a way to save Comrade Zhang Gongxian. In order to turn this determination into practical action, the hospital Party committee convened a joint expanded meeting of the hospital Party committee and leading cadres. A very heated debate unfolded at the meeting, and finally, a resolution to save Comrade Zhang Gongxian was passed.

    The hospital Party committee issued a call to comrades to donate blood to the injured, and sixty-five comrades immediately went for blood tests. The blood transfusion team from the 108th Military Hospital also rushed to assist. After transfusing blood to the injured, the blood seeped from the wounds, soaking through layers of bandages and emitting a very unpleasant odor. The injured's body temperature was always around 39 degrees Celsius, and his pulse was 120 beats per minute. His body was very weak. Everyone in the entire hospital was worried, and Party members volunteered to take care of the injured. Surgeons and nurses organized day and night shifts, feeding the injured twelve times a day and using all possible methods to treat him.

    Ten tense days passed, and Zhang Gongxian's life defeated death. A month later, Zhang Gongxian was able to sit up, and his diet had basically returned to normal. Now, after only two or three more bandage changes, the wounds will heal.

    The comrades of the 104th Military Hospital said: "As long as politics takes command, technology can create miracles."

    政治挂帅　妙手回春
    越南人民军一医院创造了奇迹
    烫伤全身面积94％的病人获救
    越南人民军某部炊事员张公献，在挑开水时摔了一跤，整桶开水淋在他身上，被烫伤的部分占全身面积94％，除了一双眼睛和头发之外，他的全身都起了泡。
    张公献被送进一零四军医院。外科医生立即动手急救，花了三个多钟头给他洗涤并包扎好。“这个伤员能不能活下去呢？”医生和护士们在手术室里开紧急现场会议。有人说，根据医书的记载，被烫伤占全身面积40％就很难治疗；烫伤达全身面积的55％，活下去的希望就极微少。经过大家讨论后，他们下决心克服困难，想办法救活张公献同志。医院党委会为使这个决心变为实际行动，又召开一次医院党委和领导干部的联席扩大会议。会上展开了十分激烈的辩论，最后通过了救活张公献同志的决心书。
    医院党委发出动员同志们给伤员输血的号召，立即有六十五个同志去验血。一零八军医院的输血队也赶来协助。给伤员输了血，但血从伤处渗出，浸透了层层绷带，发出非常难闻的臭味。伤员的体温总在三十九度左右，脉搏一分钟跳动一百二十次。他的身体非常衰弱。全医院每个人都忧心忡忡，党员们自愿来照顾伤员。外科医生和护士组织了日夜轮值班，每天给伤员饮食十二次，并用尽一切方法为他治疗。
    紧张的十天过去了，张公献的生命战胜了死神。一个月之后，张公献能够坐起来了，并且饭食已基本上恢复正常。现在，只需再换两三次绷带，伤处就可以痊愈。
    一零四军医院的同志们说：“只要政治挂帅，技术就能够创造奇迹”。
