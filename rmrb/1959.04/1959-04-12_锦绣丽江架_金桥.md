Brocade Lijiang Builds a "Golden Bridge"
　　Lian Xiang
　　Along the Jinsha River, it is verdant, brocade-like, not cold in winter, not hot in summer. Here are towering, eternally unmelting snow mountains, towering, lush primeval forests, inexhaustible gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin, and herds of cattle and "horse caravans" all over the mountains. For thousands of years, industrious and brave, singing and dancing Naxi, Lisu, Tibetan, Yi, Bai, Miao, and dozens of other fraternal ethnic groups have lived and thrived on this beautiful land. This is the Lijiang Special Zone on the southwestern border of the motherland.
　　Before liberation, the twelve counties under the jurisdiction of the entire Lijiang Special Zone did not have a single kilometer of highway or cart road. High mountains and turbulent rivers blocked the exchanges between the ethnic groups here and with the people of the interior. At that time, they mainly relied on carrying loads on their heads and backs for transportation. After liberation, the Party and the government attached great importance to mountain transportation construction. From 1951 to 1957, the Lijiang Special Zone successively built 372 kilometers of highways.
　　However, some ethnic minority brothers living in the deep mountains had never seen a car. Last year, during the nationwide steelmaking campaign, earthen blast furnaces had already spread throughout Lijiang, but coking coal could not be transported in time, and the ore from the mountains could not be transported down. Everyone decided to build a highway from Lijiang to Huaping.
　　From Lijiang to Huaping, the entire journey is 279 kilometers. Along the way, mountains overlap, towering into the clouds, and the turbulent Jinsha River runs through it. The banks are precipitous, like carved jade, with countless giant valleys. In the past, there was only a winding path stretching for hundreds of miles. "Horse caravans" and pedestrians passed through this cliff, and a misstep would be dangerous. People could talk to each other standing across the way, but it would take one or two days to meet on the road. Now, thousands of ethnic minority brothers are fighting here, determined to make the mountains bow their heads and the rivers give way. According to their traditional saying, they want to build "golden bridges" and "silver bridges" on the towering peaks that can be reached by hand, bringing ten thousand years of happiness to future generations.
　　The difficulties encountered in building roads in this remote area where people rarely set foot can be imagined. But no matter how great the difficulties, they are not as great as the determination of tens of thousands of migrant workers. Naxi girls used to choose auspicious days to go out. But now, the old gods can no longer control them. The road construction workers fought day and night on the misty, rainy peaks, treating the construction site as a battlefield. Shoulder to shoulder with them in "combat" were the leading cadres of counties and townships. This is both a construction site and a factory. Some people work as stonemasons during the day and carpenters at night. For thousands of years, ethnic minority brothers were accustomed to carrying loads on their heads and backs, and could not even use a carrying pole. But now they can build cars, and many people have become excellent carpenters.
　　The construction site is a happy and harmonious big family, where people from dozens of ethnic groups live together in perfect harmony. Despite the intense labor day and night, the Naxi girls, who love cleanliness, still apply powder and rouge every day, dressing up beautifully. They are all rosy-cheeked and beaming, singing mountain songs while working. They sing:
　　Flowers need people to plant,
　　Roads need people to open,
　　Build a smooth road,
　　Bringing happiness.
　　If you stand in front of these girls and look at their soaring revolutionary spirit, their optimism full of confidence, and then look at the beautiful peaks and mountains strung together like beads, how great people appear, and how small the mountains appear!
　　September 19, 1958, was an extraordinary day on the Lijiang-Huaping highway construction site. On this day, representatives from the Ministry of Communications came to the construction site to express their condolences to the road construction workers. As soon as the news spread, the entire construction site was boiling. Many people swung their pickaxes and sledgehammers even harder, so that the representatives could see how heroic the ethnic minority brothers were in leaping forward. Many people surrounded the first car to enter this deep mountain, touching it again and again, asking this and that. What they saw was not just a beautiful car. From this car, they saw a bright and brilliant prospect full of infinite light and happiness. The Lijiang Special Zone, which did not have a single kilometer of highway, will soon have cars running through every county. The people of Lijiang will stride from narrow paths onto smooth roads for vehicles and horses, rushing forward!

　　锦绣丽江架“金桥”
　　连祥
    在金沙江沿岸，一片苍翠，锦绣如织，冬天不冷，夏天不热。这里有穹隆峻拔、万古不化的雪山，有古木参天、葱茏茂密的原始森林，有挖不完的金、银、铜、铁、锡，有满山遍野的牛群、“马帮”。几千年来，勤劳勇敢、能歌善舞的纳西、傈僳、藏、彝、白、苗等数十个兄弟民族，繁养生息在这块美丽的土地上。这就是祖国西南边陲的丽江专区。
    解放以前，整个丽江专区所属的十二个县，没有一公里公路和马车道，重重高山，滔滔激流，阻隔着这里的民族之间和同内地人民的往来。那时，他们主要靠头顶背负从事运输。解放后，党和政府十分重视山区交通建设，从1951年到1957年，丽江专区前后修建了三百七十二公里公路。
    但是居住在深山里的少数民族兄弟，还有的从来没有见过汽车。去年全民炼钢铁，土高炉已经布满了整个丽江，但是焦煤不能及时运来，山上的矿砂又运不下来，大家决定修建一条从丽江到华坪的公路。
    从丽江到华坪，全程二百七十九公里，沿线群峦叠峰、高入云霄，有波涛滚滚的金沙江从中穿过，两岸壁立，俨如削玉，巨流峪谷，不可胜数。过去这里只有绵延数百里的羊肠小道，“马帮”、行人就从这悬崖绝壁上盘山而过，一失足就有掉下去的危险。人们站在对面可以通话，可是走起路来，一两天也碰不上面。现在，成千上万的少数民族兄弟就战斗在这里，他们决心要让高山低头，要让河水让路。按照他们传统的说法，要在这伸手可以摩天的高山绝顶，为后代子孙架起“金桥”“银桥”，引来万年幸福。
    在这人迹罕到的偏僻地区筑路，碰到的困难是可以想见的。可是困难再大，也没有几万民工的决心大。纳西族的姑娘们，过去出门都要选择吉日。可是，如今的老天爷再也管束不了她们。筑路民工们日夜奋战在烟锁雾环、阴雨连绵的高山之巅，把工地当作战场。和他们一起并肩“作战”的，有县里乡里的领导干部。这里是工地也是工厂，有的人白天当石工，晚上当木匠。几千年来，少数民族兄弟习惯了头顶背负，连扁担也不会用。可是现在他们已经能造车子，很多人还成了出色的木匠。
    工地是一个欢乐幸福的大家庭，几十个兄弟民族的人民生活在一起，相处无间。尽管白天黑夜紧张地劳动，可是素爱清洁的纳西族姑娘，每天照样要搽粉点胭脂，打扮得漂漂亮亮。她们一个个红光满面，喜气洋溢，一面干活，一面唱着山歌。她们唱道：
    花树要人栽，
    大路要人开，
    修起平坦道，
    引得幸福来。
    你若站在这些姑娘面前，看看她们那种冲天的革命干劲，那种满怀信心的乐观主义，再看看那峰峦秀美、缀如联珠的高山峻岭，人显得多么伟大，山显得多么渺小！
    1958年的9月19日，在丽江—华坪公路工地上是个不平常的日子。这一天，交通部派来慰问筑路民工的代表到达了工地。消息一传开，整个工地都沸腾了。很多人把手镐大锤抡得更加起劲，好让代表们看看少数民族兄弟是用多么豪迈的步伐在飞跃。多少人围着第一次开进这深山的汽车，摸了又摸，问这问那。他们看到的不只是一部漂亮的汽车，从这部汽车身上，他们看到了一个光辉灿烂、充满无限光明幸福的远景。没有一公里公路的丽江专区，用不了多久，就要县县通汽车了。丽江人民将要从羊肠小道跨上车马坦途，疾驰猛进！
