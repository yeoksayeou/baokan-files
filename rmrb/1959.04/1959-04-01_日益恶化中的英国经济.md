    The British economic situation has significantly deteriorated, and signs of crisis are quite evident. The British government has taken many measures to try to delay the development of the crisis, but these measures cannot solve the fundamental difficulties facing the British economy. On the other hand, Britain is facing increasingly strong challenges in the capitalist market, especially in the Western European market, which cannot but make the British economic prospects even worse.

      Gloomy Economy in the Last Three Years

    Since the war, stimulated by the renewal and expansion of long-unreplaced fixed capital and the active export market, the British economy experienced a short period of prosperity from 1953 to 1955. Its industrial production index, with 1953 as 100, increased to 114 in 1955. After that, it entered a state of stagnation, and from April 1958, there was a continuous decline for seven months, a drop of 3%.

    The production of the steel and coal industries, which are the foundation of heavy industry, declined the most severely. Steel production fell from 21.7 million tons in 1957 to 19.57 million tons in 1958, a reduction of about one-tenth. In terms of the coal industry, Britain's output last year was 215.8 million tons, which was still 28 million tons less than the pre-war output in 1937.

    For the shipbuilding industry, which is of great significance to Britain, a traditional maritime nation, the ships built in 1958 decreased by 18% in terms of tonnage compared to 1957. The British shipbuilding industry has fallen from the first place in the world to the third place.

    The British cotton textile industry, which once dominated the world, has not been able to recover to pre-war levels since the war, and the situation in 1958 was particularly serious. Cotton cloth production decreased by 14% compared to 1957.

    After a year of recession last year, British industrial production has still not improved in the first few weeks of this year.

    Since the beginning of this year, the production volume of the British steel industry has remained low, and its capacity utilization rate is still only 75%. The situation in the coal industry is even worse, facing "the most serious situation in thirty years." At the end of January, the accumulated coal reached 34.7 million tons, an increase of about 10 million tons compared to a year ago. Thirty-six mines across Britain have been closed since the beginning of February, causing thousands of miners to lose their jobs. In South Wales alone, 3,000 miners lost their jobs in early February. The situation in the machinery industry is also not good. The growth rate of automobiles, which previously increased the fastest, has recently slowed down. Domestic and foreign orders for products from other departments are generally declining. The economic crisis has also affected the British chemical industry, especially the inorganic chemical sector. Because this sector has always been a sensitive barometer of the overall economic situation, it makes the already bleak British economic picture appear even gloomier this year.

    In terms of foreign trade, which is of great significance to the British economy, the situation is also deteriorating. The total value of foreign trade exports in 1958 decreased by 3.7% compared to 1957, while the import value decreased by 7%. Since the beginning of this year, the British foreign trade situation has continued to deteriorate. In January alone, British export trade to the Sterling Area decreased by 7% compared to the previous quarter, with exports to New Zealand and India decreasing even more significantly.

    Accompanying the decline in production and the reduction in exports is the continuous increase in the number of unemployed. Currently, there are more than 600,000 unemployed people in Britain, double the number compared to last year, reaching the highest level in eleven years.

      The Government's Palliative Measures

    In order to try to get rid of the increasingly mature economic crisis, the British ruling class has taken various measures. Domestically, it has repeatedly relaxed monetary policy, gradually reducing bank interest rates from 7% to 4%, in an attempt to stimulate private investment. At the same time, it has also abolished restrictions on installment purchases to encourage consumption. In the past, when people bought goods on installment plans, they needed to pay a down payment of 10%-50% in advance, and the remaining amount owed was repaid weekly or monthly within one or two years. Now, such regulations have been abolished altogether. The down payment for installment purchases can be reduced or waived, and the repayment period for the amount owed has also been greatly extended. In addition, measures have also been taken to increase subsidies for the establishment of industrial and commercial enterprises, encourage private investment, and increase investment in "nationalized enterprises," etc. Abroad, it has expanded export credit guarantees in an attempt to increase exports and stimulate production.

    However, these measures cannot solve Britain's economic problems. First of all, easing monetary policy by lowering interest rates carries the risk of causing inflation. For several years, the purpose of Britain's continuous increase in bank interest rates has been to prevent the inflationary crisis existing in the British economy.

    Secondly, the abolition of restrictions on installment purchases, on the surface, can stimulate the British people to buy more things, thereby increasing the demand in the domestic market to stimulate production. However, this approach is tantamount to living beyond one's means and can only provide temporary stimulation at best.

    As for lowering interest rates to stimulate investment, that is even more unlikely in the current sluggish market. Domestic investment in Britain is currently being cut back significantly. British investment in the processing industry in the fourth quarter of 1958 has decreased by 6% compared to a year ago, and investment in industrial buildings has decreased by 9%. It is expected that British investment in the processing industry will decrease by another 10% in 1959. The British government's hope of increasing private investment is completely unrealistic.

      Shrinking Foreign Markets

    In terms of foreign markets, the capitalist world market is not expanding but shrinking. With the deepening of the capitalist world economic crisis, market competition is becoming increasingly acute. Britain's foreign markets are primarily the Sterling Area, and secondly, Western Europe. One-half of Britain's exported goods are shipped to the Sterling Area, and one-quarter are shipped to the Western European market. However, Britain's trade with both Western Europe and the Sterling Area has been seriously affected.

    The countries in the Sterling Area are countries that produce and export raw materials, and their economies are completely dependent on the export of raw materials for their survival. However, in recent years, due to the impact of the capitalist world economic crisis, raw material prices have continued to decline. Taking wool as an example, the recent wool prices in Australia have fallen to the lowest level since September 1949. Under the increasingly acute conditions of the world capitalist economic crisis, despite the significant drop in raw material prices, there are still many raw materials that raw material producing countries cannot sell. The decline in raw material prices and the reduction in the export volume of raw materials have greatly reduced the export income of Sterling Area countries. In 1958, India's export value was 5.836 billion rupees, while in 1957 it was 6.004 billion rupees. The export value decreased by nearly 200 million rupees in 1958 compared to 1957. In the first half of 1958, Australia's total export value decreased by 32%, which was due to the drop in wool prices, the reduction in export volume, and the significant reduction in wheat export volume. The total export value of Rhodesia in the first five months of 1958 also decreased by 20% compared to the same period in 1957 due to the drop in copper prices. The export income of other Sterling Area countries has also decreased to varying degrees.

    The drop in raw material prices in the Sterling Area countries has, on the one hand, benefited Britain in terms of importing raw materials. On the other hand, however, the reduction in export income of the Sterling Area countries caused by this has also weakened their import capacity. As a result, Britain's attempt to expand exports has become greatly difficult. For example, in the first half of 1958, Sterling Area countries lost 200 million pounds in income due to the drop in raw material prices, causing British exports to various raw material countries in the Sterling Area to fall by 8% to 15% last year.

    In the Western European market, the establishment of the "Common Market" has changed the situation in favor of West Germany and unfavorable to Britain. Due to the failure of the "Free Trade Area" plan negotiations, Britain has been completely excluded from the "Common Market," and it is watching as the Western European market is about to be controlled by the six countries. Among these six countries, West Germany's economic strength has an overwhelming advantage. West Germany's industrial production alone is almost equal to the total industrial production of the other five countries. West Germany has become the master of the Western European market. British bourgeois figures believe that the establishment of the Western European "Common Market" is a serious challenge to Britain by West Germany.

    Under these circumstances, Britain cannot expand its exports to the Sterling Area, nor can it increase its trade with Western Europe. As a result, Britain's foreign trade can only further shrink. The inability to improve trade conditions will undoubtedly worsen Britain's economic crisis.

    The Evil Consequences of the "Cold War" Policy

    The deepening British economic crisis is, of course, an inevitable accompaniment to the capitalist mode of production, but it is also a product of the "Cold War" policy. Since the war, in order to follow the United States' "Cold War" policy, Britain has been intensively engaged in arms expansion and war preparation, maintaining military spending at extremely high levels. Annual military spending of 1.5 to 1.6 billion pounds has consumed one-third of the total budget expenditure and 9% of the gross national product. Britain's heavy military burden is second to none among European capitalist countries. The percentage of military appropriations in the gross national product in European capitalist countries is: France 7%, the Netherlands 6%, West Germany and Norway 4%, and Denmark 3%. The huge military spending is not only unaffordable for Britain's weakened national economic strength after the war, but it has also brought harmful effects to its export trade.

    First of all, Britain is a country that largely relies on foreign trade. It needs to import food and raw materials from abroad and export industrial products to pay for imports. About 40% of the industrial products produced in Britain are for export. As a result of arms expansion and war preparation, the demand for raw materials has increased, thereby increasing its imports. Under normal circumstances, the increase in imports is offset by the increase in exports. However, under the conditions of militarization of the national economy, a considerable part of the imported raw materials is absorbed by military production, which makes the civilian industry increasingly shrink due to the shortage of raw materials and manpower, thus affecting the quantity of goods that can be provided for export, thereby weakening Britain's export capacity.

    Secondly, huge military spending is bound to affect Britain's industrial investment capacity. British investment in the processing industry has fallen below the level before 1957 since the fourth quarter of 1957. In 1958, British industrial investment continued to decrease. The reduction in investment makes Britain unable to implement technological innovation, resulting in low production efficiency and high product costs, thereby weakening the competitiveness of British industrial products in the world market.

    At the same time, in recent years, Britain has also tasted the bitter fruit of the other side of the "Cold War" policy, that is, due to following the United States' embargo policy, Britain has suffered considerable losses in East-West trade. This is obviously very harmful to Britain, which mainly relies on foreign trade to maintain its economy.

    The deterioration of trade has made Britain's balance of payments increasingly worse, and its gold and foreign exchange reserves have been declining for a long time. Before the war, Britain had huge investments overseas, and trade deficits could be offset by overseas investment income. After the war, the situation has undergone fundamental changes. As a result of the continuous weakening of Britain's economy during and after the war, it has lost many of its overseas investments, and its investment income has also been greatly reduced. The net profit that Britain received from overseas investment accounted for 21% of the total import trade in 1938, but it has now dropped to 3% to 5%. Therefore, Britain's balance of payments has lost its balance.

      Demands for an End to the "Cold War"

    It can be seen from this that Britain's economic crisis is inseparable from the "Cold War." Therefore, in order for Britain to get rid of its economic predicament, it must first stop the "Cold War," abandon the policy of arms expansion and war preparation on the basis of peaceful coexistence, and liberate itself from the burden of huge military spending. As early as January 1954, the former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler openly admitted: "If there were no defense burden, the balance of payments situation could be improved, with a benefit of approximately 350 million to 400 million pounds per year." The improvement of the fiscal balance can enable it to increase domestic investment and renew fixed capital equipment in order to reduce product costs, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of British export commodities in the world market, so as to achieve the goal of expanding exports.

    Secondly, under the conditions that the capacity of the capitalist world market is shrinking, Britain should abandon the embargo policy that serves the Cold War and develop extensive trade relations with countries in the peace and democracy camp on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, which will also help improve Britain's economic situation. People still remember that during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Soviet Union was the world's largest buyer of machine equipment. In 1931, it purchased one-third of the world's total machine exports, and in 1932, it purchased half. In the early 1930s, 80% of the lathes exported by Britain were sold to the Soviet Union. Thanks to the Soviet Union's strong purchases, many British industries were spared bankruptcy. Now that socialism has become a world system and the economies of all countries in the socialist camp are soaring, the widespread development of East-West trade will undoubtedly alleviate the trend of shrinking British industrial production, thereby increasing the number of employed people. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the widespread development of East-West trade can enable the raw materials of various countries in the Sterling Area to obtain stable markets, and raw material prices can also be maintained at reasonable levels. In this way, the foreign exchange income of the Sterling Area countries will be improved, and the import capacity of these countries will be increased, which will be conducive to the improvement of British export trade.

    It is no accident that all sectors of the British public are increasingly strongly demanding an end to the "Cold War," holding talks with the Soviet Union on outstanding international issues, and expanding East-West trade.

    日益恶化中的英国经济
    杨湛林
    英国经济情况有了显著的恶化，危机迹象已十分明显。英国政府采取了许多措施，以图延缓危机的发展，但这些措施并不能解决英国经济所面临的根本困难，而另一方面英国在资本主义市场、特别是在西欧市场上又遭到了越来越强烈的挑战，这不能不使得英国的经济前景更趋恶化。
      三年来经济的黯淡
    战后以来英国的经济在更新和扩大长期未更换的固定资本以及出口市场活跃的刺激下，于1953年到1955年曾经有过一个短时期的繁荣。它的工业生产指数，如以1953年为一百，则1955年曾增加到一百一十四。此后便进入停滞状态，从1958年4月份起又出现了连续七个月的下降，计下跌了3％。
    作为重工业基础的钢铁和煤炭工业的生产下降得最厉害。钢产量从1957年的二千一百七十万吨下降到1958年的一千九百五十七万吨，计减少了约十分之一。煤炭工业方面，去年英国的产量是二亿一千五百八十万吨，比战前的1937年的产量还少二千八百万吨。
    对于英国这一传统的海运国家有重要意义的造船业，1958年建造的船只，按吨位计算比1957年下降了18％。英国的造船工业已从世界第一位降到第三位。
    一度称雄世界的英国棉纺织业，战后以来一直没有能恢复战前水平，而1958年的情况尤为严重。棉布产量比1957年下降了14％。
    英国的工业生产在经过去年一年的衰退后，在今年最初几个星期里，仍然没有起色。
    今年以来，英国钢铁工业生产量，仍旧很低，它的开工率仍然只有75％。煤炭工业的情况甚至更糟，它面临着“三十年来最严重的情况”。1月底积存的煤达到了三千四百七十万吨，比一年前增加了一千万吨左右。英国各地有三十六个矿井已经从2月初开始关闭，使数以千计的矿工失业，仅在南威尔士一地就有三千名矿工在2月初失去了工作。机械工业的情况也不好。以前增产最快的小汽车最近的增长速度已经放慢。其他部门的产品的国内外订货正在普遍下降。经济危机已经波及到英国的化学工业部门，特别是无机化学部门。由于这个部门一向是总的经济情况的敏锐晴雨表，因此使得已经十分黯淡的英国经济图景，在今年显得更加黯淡。
    在对于英国经济具有重大意义的对外贸易方面，情况也在恶化。1958年的对外贸易出口总值比1957年下降了3.7％，进口值则下降了7％。今年以来，英国对外贸易情况继续恶化，1月份仅仅一个月的时间，英国对英镑区的出口贸易就比上一季度减少了7％，其中对新西兰和印度的出口减少得更显著。
    伴随着生产的下降和出口的减少而来的，是失业人数的不断增加。目前英国的失业人数有六十多万人，比去年增加了一倍，达到了十一年来的最高水平。
      政府的治标措施
    英国统治阶级为了力图摆脱日益成熟的经济危机，采取了各种措施。在国内屡次放松银根，把银行利率逐步从7％降低到4％，企图以此来刺激私人投资。同时并取消对分期付款购买的限制来鼓励消费。过去人民以分期付款购买商品时，需要事先付10％—50％的押金，其余赊欠部分则按周或按月在一二年内还清。现在这种规定一概取消，分期购买的押金可以少付或不付，赊欠部分的偿还时间也大大地延长了。此外，还采取了提高对工商企业的创业补助，鼓励私人投资，增加“国有化企业”的投资等等。在国外则扩大出口信贷保证，企图借以增加出口，刺激生产。
    不过，这些措施是不可能解决英国的经济问题的。首先，降低利率以放松银根，有引起通货膨胀的危险。几年来，英国不断提高银行利率的目的，就在于阻止存在于英国经济中的通货膨胀危机。
    其次，取消对分期付款购买的限制，从表面上看，可以刺激英国人民多买一些东西，从而增加国内市场的需要，以刺激生产。但是这种办法无异是寅吃卯粮的办法，充其量只能刺激于一时。
    至于说降低利率来刺激投资，在目前市场不景气下，那更是渺茫。目前英国的国内投资正在大量削减，英国1958年加工工业的投资在第四季度已比一年前缩减了6％，工业建筑投资缩减9％，1959年预料英国加工工业的投资还将减少10％。英国政府所希望的增加私人投资，完全是不现实的。
      国外市场的萎缩
    在国外市场方面，资本主义世界市场不是在扩大而是在缩小。随着资本主义世界经济危机的日益深刻，市场争夺战日益尖锐化。英国的国外市场第一是英镑区，第二是西欧。英国出口商品的二分之一是输往英镑区的，四分之一是输往西欧市场的。但英国不论是对西欧或是对英镑区的贸易，都受到了严重影响。
    英镑区各国是生产原料和输出原料的国家，它们的经济完全依赖于原料的出口来维持。可是近年来，由于资本主义世界经济危机的影响，原料价格不断下跌。如以羊毛为例，最近澳大利亚的羊毛价格，已经下跌到1949年9月以来的最低水平。在世界资本主义经济危机日益尖锐的条件下，尽管原料价格大大地下跌了，但是原料生产国家卖不出去的原料仍旧很多。原料价格的下跌和原料出口额的缩减，使得英镑区国家的出口收入大大地缩减了。1958年，印度的出口额是五十八亿三千六百万卢比，而1957年是六十亿零四千万卢比，1958年比1957年减少了近二亿卢比。1958年上半年，澳大利亚出口总值下降了32％，这是由于羊毛价格下跌、出口量减少及小麦出口量大大缩减的缘故。罗得西亚1958年头五个月的出口总值，也因铜的价格下跌，比1957年同期减少了20％。其他各英镑区国家的出口收入，都有不同程度的缩减。
    英镑区国家原料价格的下跌，一方面固然使英国输入原料时得到了好处，但另一方面，由此引起的英镑区国家出口收入的减少，也削弱了它们的进口能力。其结果，又使得英国想要扩大出口的企图大大困难起来。例如1958年上半年由于原料下跌英镑区国家就损失了二亿英镑的收入，使英国对英镑区各原料国家的出口在去年下跌了8％到15％。
    在西欧市场上，“共同市场”的建立，使形势发生了有利于西德不利于英国的变化。由于“自由贸易区”计划谈判的失败，英国已完全置身于“共同市场”之外，眼看西欧市场即将由六国来控制。在这六个国家中，西德的经济实力又占压倒的优势，西德一国的工业生产，就几乎等于其他五国的工业生产总和，西德已成为西欧市场的主宰者。英国资产阶级人士认为西欧“共同市场”的建立，是西德对英国的一次严重挑战。
    在这种情况下，英国既不能扩大对英镑区的出口，也不能增加对西欧的贸易，结果是英国的对外贸易只有进一步萎缩下来。贸易状况的不能改善，无疑将使英国的经济危机更加恶化。
    “冷战”政策的恶果
    日益深重的英国经济危机，固然是资本主义生产方式的必然伴随物，但同时也是“冷战”政策的产物。战后以来，英国为了追随美国的“冷战”政策，紧张地进行扩军备战，把军费开支维持在极高的水平上。每年十五、六亿英镑的军费开支，耗去了全部预算支出的三分之一和国民生产毛值的9％。英国军费负担之重，在欧洲各资本主义国家中首屈一指。欧洲各资本主义国家的军费拨款在国民生产毛值中所占的百分比为：法国7％、荷兰6％、西德和挪威为4％、丹麦3％。庞大的军费开支，不仅不是英国战后被削弱的国民经济力量所能负担，而且也给它的出口贸易带来了有害的影响。
    首先，英国是一个在很大程度上依赖于对外贸易的国家，它需要自国外输入粮食和原料，并输出工业品以偿付输入，英国生产的工业品约有40％是供输出的。扩军备战的结果，原料的需求是增加了，从而它的输入也增加了。在通常情况下，输入的增加是以输出的增加来抵偿的。但是在国民经济军事化的条件下，进口原料的颇大一部分被军火生产所吸住，这就使得民用工业在原料荒、人力荒的情况下日益萎缩，因而影响了可以提供输出的商品的数量，从而削弱了英国的输出能力。
    其次，庞大的军费开支也必然要影响英国的工业投资能力。英国加工工业的投资自1957年第四季度以来，已经落到1957年前的水平以下。1958年，英国工业投资继续减少。投资的减少使英国无力实行技术革新，以致生产效率低落，产品成本较高，从而削弱了英国工业品在世界市场上的竞争能力。
    同时，几年来英国还尝到了“冷战”政策的另一面的苦果，这就是由于追随美国的禁运政策，英国在东西方贸易上受到了不小的损失。这对于主要依靠对外贸易维持它们经济的英国，显然是十分有害的。
    贸易的恶化使英国的国际收支日益恶化，黄金外汇储备长期下降。战前，英国在海外拥有巨额的投资，贸易逆差尚可以海外投资收入来弥补。战后形势发生了根本的变化，由于战时和战后英国的经济不断削弱的结果，它的海外投资丧失了很多，它的投资收入也大大地减少了。英国从海外投资所得到的纯利在1938年占进口贸易总额的21％，而现在则降低到3％到5％。因此，英国的国际收支失去了平衡。
      要求结束“冷战”
    由此可见，英国的经济危机是同“冷战”分不开的。因此，英国要摆脱在经济上所处的困境，首先必须停止“冷战”，在和平共处的基础上，放弃扩军备战政策，把它从巨额军费开支的负担下解放出来。英国前任财政大臣巴特勒早在1954年1月就公开承认：“如果没有防务负担，收支平衡状况可以得到改善，每年约可获益三亿五千万至四亿英镑。”财政收支的改善可以使它有能力来增加国内投资，更新固定资本设备，以降低产品成本，从而增强英国出口商品在世界市场上的竞争力，以达到扩大输出的目的。
    其次，在资本主义世界市场容量日益缩小的条件下，英国放弃为冷战服务的禁运政策，同和平民主阵营国家在平等互利的基础上广泛开展贸易关系，这也会有助于改善英国的经济状况。人们还记得，在三十年代经济大恐慌时代，苏联曾是世界上机器装备的最大买主，1931年它购买了世界机器输出总额的三分之一，1932年购买了半数。1930年初，英国出口的车床有80％是卖给苏联的，由于苏联的大力购买，英国许多工业才幸免破产。现在社会主义已成为世界体系，社会主义阵营各国经济无比高涨，因此，广泛开展东西方贸易无疑将使英国工业生产缩减的趋势得以缓和，从而增加就业人数，这是一方面。另一方面，广泛开展东西方贸易可以使得英镑区各国的原料得到稳定的市场，原料价格也可维持在合理的水平上，这样一来，英镑区国家的外汇收入将得到改善，这些国家进口能力将得到增加，从而有利于英国出口贸易的改善。
    英国各阶层公众越来越强烈要求结束“冷战”，就悬而未决的国际问题同苏联举行会谈以及扩大东西方贸易的要求，这不是偶然的。
