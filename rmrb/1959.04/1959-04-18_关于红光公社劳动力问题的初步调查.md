　　Preliminary Investigation on Labor Force Issues in Hongguang Commune
　　China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hebei Province, Ningjin County Agricultural Economic Survey Team
    With the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, a labor shortage has emerged in rural areas.
    With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, an unprecedented labor shortage emerged in rural areas. 1959 is a year of decisive significance in our country's three years of hard struggle, and industrial and agricultural production will continue to leap forward. The contradiction between the labor shortage and the needs of the further Great Leap Forward will become even more prominent. How to rationally arrange and use the labor force and improve labor productivity has become an extremely important issue in rural areas today. In order to understand the situation of rural labor shortage and the methods to solve the labor shortage, we conducted some preliminary investigations in Hongguang People's Commune, Ningjin County, Hebei Province.
    Hongguang People's Commune is located in the plains, with 95 villages, 11,294 households, and 46,872 people, including 9,760 able-bodied laborers, 9,198 semi-able-bodied laborers, and 127,600 mu of cultivated land, with an average burden of 8.8 mu per laborer.
    Since the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958, the commune has experienced a considerable labor shortage. The total number of workdays in agriculture in 1958 was 3.66 million. According to the past labor turnout, only 2.505 million workdays could be provided at that time, leaving a shortage of 1.155 million workdays, accounting for 31% of the total workdays in agriculture.
    Why is the labor force so tight? From the situation of Hongguang Commune, there are several main reasons:
    1. The improvement of intensive cultivation of crops and the expansion of the scale of reproduction require more labor input. In 1958, the commune actively implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Taking deep plowing as an example, 175,500 more workdays were used in 1958 than in 1957, an increase of nine times.
　　Requirements for Plowing Depth and Quality 　　Average Labor Input Per Mu (workdays/mu)　　Total Labor Input in the Commune (workdays)
　　　　1957　　1958　　% Increase　　1957　　1958　　% Increase　　1957　　1958　　% Increase
　　Deep Plowing　　4-5 inches　　1-1.5 feet　　125-200　　0.2　　0.32　　39　　0019,500　　195,000　　900
    (Note: In 1957, all were plowed; in 1958, 33% used deep plowing, 25% used tractor plowing, and 42% used manual digging.)
    The cultivation of various major crops also increased the amount of labor used compared with before. The following is a comparison of the average labor input per mu for several crops in 1958 and 1957: (Unit: workdays/mu)
　　Year　　Wheat　　Cotton　　Sweet Potato　　Corn
　　1957　　1.5　　15　　15　　14
　　1958　　7　　25　　2　　1.5　　17.5
　　% Increase　　366　　66　　43　　25
    (Note: The labor input per mu of wheat refers to the labor input per mu from sowing to before freezing.)
    Among all the measures, the labor input for "water", "fertilizer", and "soil" increased the most. For example, the average increase in labor input per mu for the three items of "water", "fertilizer", and "soil" for wheat in the Xicao Village Production Team of the commune in the past two or three years is as follows: (Unit: workdays/mu) Measures 56-57 57-58 58-59 (planned) Increase Water 0612 1 times (compared 58-59 with 57-58) Fertilizer 1.5612 7 times (compared 58-59 with 56-57) Soil 0.515 9 times (compared 58-59 with 56-57)
    In addition, the commune also used a lot of labor in farmland capital construction in 1958. According to incomplete statistics, 173,500 workdays were used in water conservancy (including building reservoirs, canals, ponds, and drilling wells), accounting for more than 4.7% of the total agricultural workdays.
    2. Supporting national industrial construction and developing commune-run industries, engaging in diversified operations, and the outflow of some labor force have reduced the number of agricultural laborers and changed the structure of the labor force. From September to December 1958, the commune transferred a total of 1,986 young and middle-aged laborers to Chengde, Tianjin, Handan, Inner Mongolia and other places to support national industrial construction, and transferred 1,021 young and middle-aged laborers to commune-run industries; another 1,021 were transferred to diversified economy, and more than 400 laborers migrated out. This not only reduced the number of laborers in the commune, but also caused structural changes, thus making the agricultural labor force even more tight.
　　Changes in the Labor Force Structure of the Commune from September to December 1958
　　　　September 1958 (% of total labor force)　　December 1958 (% of total labor force)　　Increase/Decrease (%)
　　Male　　Able-bodied　　35　　25　　-10
　　　　Semi-able-bodied　　15　　16　　+1
　　Female　　Able-bodied 34 32 -2 Semi-able-bodied 16 27 +11
    In addition, since the People's Commune was just established, the new labor organization and management system has not yet been established and improved, so the arrangement and use of labor is not perfect, and there are still phenomena of work stoppage and waste. For example, last year, the Sixth Management Area failed to adjust the ridges according to the specifications required by the Party Committee during wheat sowing, resulting in the inability to irrigate after the ridges were adjusted. The entire area mobilized 50% of the labor force and spent two to three days re-adjusting the ridges, wasting four to six thousand workdays. There are many similar situations.
    Labor shortage has brought difficulties to production, but it has also greatly promoted production.
    Labor shortage is a difficulty encountered in the Great Leap Forward of the commune's production. But it also reflects the rapid progress and grand scale of the People's Commune's production and construction. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "... The labor shortage felt in our country with a population of more than 600 million proves that my country's industrial and agricultural production is developing greatly, and the national economy is prospering rapidly." From Hongguang Commune, it can be clearly seen that the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958 did make the labor force very tight, but this tension brought very fruitful results. The average yield per mu of grain crops in the commune was 1,212 jin, an increase of 196% compared with 1957 (average yield per mu of 410 jin). With the increase in agricultural products, the public accumulation of the commune increased, reaching 1,408,000 yuan. The commune has established 246 factories of all sizes, including machinery factories, electrical machinery factories, and fertilizer factories, and manufactured many machines such as diesel engines, electric motors, and water pumps. The output value in 1958 reached 1,146,600 yuan.
    In addition, the labor shortage has also greatly promoted the following things: (1) It promoted the realization of the principle of everyone working and doing their best, and basically made it possible for everyone to participate in labor within their ability. In 1957, many villages felt that there was some surplus labor. Sometimes, commune members asked the team leader for work, but the team leader felt that there were few jobs and too many people, so there was no way to arrange it. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, this situation has been fundamentally changed. It can be said that it has reached the point where "everyone is working, and every household has no idle people." For example, the attendance rate of the Pangjia Temple Production Team was only 60% in the past, but in the later period of 1958, it often reached 100%. (2) It promoted the thorough liberation of women, so that the majority of women, with the help of public welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, and sewing groups established by the commune, got rid of trivial housework and came out to engage in the commune's production labor. This liberation of female labor has not only added new force to the production front, but also because they each receive wages after participating in labor and become economically independent, their status in society and in the family has also been further improved. (3) It promoted the mass movement of tool reform. In 1958, Hongguang Commune manufactured, modified, repaired and promoted 7,546 various farm tools (including water lifting tools and transportation tools). These tools generally increased work efficiency from half to more than ten times. For example, in 1958, the task of harvesting sweet potatoes was very large, the time was tight, and the labor was small; however, under this situation, the masses quickly modified the double-bottom plow and deep-plowing plow into potato-digging tools, which increased the work efficiency by more than three times compared with using a hoe, solving the urgent need. This item alone saved more than 50,000 workdays. (4) The shortage of labor requires the full and rational use of labor and improved work efficiency. It was under this situation that the commune quickly realized the militarization of organization, the combatization of action, and the collectivization of life; new labor organization forms such as large-scale cooperation and labor specialized teams have also emerged one after another. This not only improved labor efficiency, but also strengthened the organization and discipline of the peasant masses.
    The vast majority of commune members understand the significance of the labor shortage. Commune members said: "Being busy is a good thing. With work to do, there is enough to eat." "When the Japanese devils occupied the three northeastern provinces, the workers lost their jobs and were not busy; in the old society, beggars and the landless were not busy; but who wants to live that kind of life?" "In the old society, they were busy working for landlords and rich peasants and doing odd jobs. Now they are busy with the Great Leap Forward and Great Construction, laying the foundation for their happy lives. How can they not be happy!"
    Nevertheless, the labor shortage has also brought many difficulties to production. For example, last year's autumn harvest was somewhat rough due to insufficient labor, and the "tail" of the autumn harvest was prolonged, which affected the actual harvest of crops. For example, because sweet potatoes and cotton were harvested roughly, a lot were lost in the field. After re-harvesting, 1.65 million jin of sweet potatoes and 176,000 jin of cotton were obtained; more than 500,000 jin of peanuts were frozen due to untimely harvesting, which reduced the oil yield by 11%. In addition, a small number of sweet potatoes and peanuts were lost in the field. In order to further improve labor productivity and solve the contradiction between large tasks and insufficient labor, Hongguang People's Commune has taken the following measures:
    Several Ways to Solve the Labor Shortage
    First, according to this year's production plan, we must take stock of the labor force of the entire commune, conduct a comprehensive and appropriate arrangement, and while ensuring the labor force required for agricultural production increase, we must also ensure the labor force required for the development of sideline industries, industry, and living services.
    Vigorously Carry Out Tool Reform and Technological Revolution
    Watering is one of the agricultural tasks that consumes a lot of labor in Hongguang Commune. At present, it mainly relies on waterwheels (and a few windlasses), and there are very few machine wells. Each person can water half a mu per day with a windlass, and each person can water 0.7 to 1 mu per day with a waterwheel, while the efficiency of a machine well is nine times higher than that of a waterwheel. For watering wheat, if calculated according to 12 waterings a year, the windlass requires 24 workdays per mu, the waterwheel requires 15, and the machine well only needs 1.5. The 76 machine wells that will be put into production in the commune and the 50 machine wells that will be put into production in the second half of 1959 can save a total of 205,000 workdays throughout the year. In addition, with the planned renovation of 400 power waterwheels and other water lifting tools, 80,000 workdays can be saved throughout the year. The two items together can save 285,000 workdays, which can solve more than 28% of the total labor shortage throughout the year.
    Deep plowing is also a labor-intensive agricultural task. Digging 1.5 feet deep, each person can dig a little more than 0.15 mu of land per day, and a deep-plowing plow can plow 1.5 to 2 mu per day. In 1959, 600 deep-plowing plows can be manufactured, and three tractors are planned to be added for deep plowing, which can save 81,300 workdays throughout the year.
    With the increase in fertilizer application, the transportation volume is increasing. The daily workload of human carrying is 1,800 city jin Huali; handcarts increase by 0.77 times compared with human carrying (daily workload is 3,200 city jin Huali); rubber-wheeled carts increase by one times compared with iron-wheeled carts (the former has a daily workload of 20,000 city jin Huali, the latter is 10,000 city jin Huali). If the iron-wheeled carts are replaced with bearings, it can increase by half compared with the original. In 1959, it is planned to manufacture 700 sets of bearings, which can save 26,000 workdays. The commune is preparing to increase 2,000 handcarts, which can save 64,000 workdays, plus 70 rubber-wheeled carts and 30 trailers, which can save a total of 102,400 workdays.
    Processing sweet potatoes and rice also takes up a lot of manpower. The 267 flour mills in the commune occupy 404 people and 267 livestock, using more than 133,000 workdays and 88,000 animal workdays throughout the year. If the commune uses the power mill created by Pangjia Temple, only five to six units are enough. Each unit can grind more than 5,000 jin per day. If calculated by promoting half of them, it can save 65,700 workdays and 44,000 animal workdays.
    The commune also plans other tool reforms, such as chaff cutters, watering carts, close-planting wide-row seeders, canteen utensils, seedling planters, and other small and medium-sized tools, which can save 150,000 workdays.
    According to the commune's calculation, tool reform can save more than 684,000 workdays, solving 67.7% of the total labor shortage.
    Improve Labor Organization and Management, and Improve Work Efficiency.
    In addition to arranging labor for various undertakings, the commune also conducted a large-scale division of areas and land adjustment before the Spring Festival, dividing 113 production squares and adjusting the imbalance between less labor and more land and more labor and less land. For example, in Longtan Village, each laborer bears an average of 3.89 mu, while in Daguo Village, each laborer bears an average of 9 mu, a difference of 1.3 times. After this adjustment, the distribution of land and labor reached a balance; at the same time, the land of more than 90% of the villages was close to the production team. The farthest land in Longtan Village was five to six li away from the village, and now the farthest is no more than three li, which avoids a lot of labor time waste. Commune members said: "Not to mention sending fertilizer and pulling crops home, just walking back and forth can save a lot of workdays!" "I used to be able to send four carts of fertilizer a day, but now I can send more than ten carts, and I no longer have to worry about the difficulty of sending fertilizer." On the basis of dividing areas, labor force teams were organized. According to production needs and the principle of making the best use of talents, each production team organized specialized teams. Specialized organizations are convenient for studying and mastering business, which can improve work efficiency and strengthen the sense of responsibility. After the Xicao Village organized a specialized team, the phenomenon of waiting for work assignment disappeared, the team leader got rid of bureaucratism, studied business, and it was also easy to fix farm work and contract work.
    Strengthening the responsibility system and promoting quota management can not only reduce waste, but also strengthen work efficiency. In the past, some management areas and production teams did not implement the responsibility system enough, resulting in some waste of manpower. For example, in 1958, the Sixth Management Area wasted 6 to 7 workdays per mu due to non-standard wheat planting, totaling 1,400 to 1,700 workdays were lost; more than 400 mu needed to be replanted, using 4 to 5 workdays per mu, totaling 1,600 to 2,000 workdays were used additionally. Some production teams have achieved good results after strengthening the responsibility system. For example, Tieyang Village implemented a small contract system when watering wheat, and the responsibility was determined to the person. The commune required the completion of the wheat watering work in ten days, and the team completed it in six days, improving work efficiency by 20%. Some commune members went to work in the field before the bell rang, and commune member Yang Yuliang ran to the field for fear of falling behind. In order to strengthen the responsibility system, the commune, on the basis of reorganizing production teams, dividing cultivated areas, and carrying out four fixations (fixed cultivated land, labor, livestock, and farm tools), implemented the "three fixations and one reward" system, that is, setting leap forward targets, setting submission tasks, and setting investment expenditures, implementing three-level accounting, and rewarding those who over-produce and save. The production team implemented four to the field for the team (measures to the field, indicators to the field, responsibility to the field, management to the field), and the team implemented four fixations for the commune members (fixed projects, tasks, quality, and time). This can strengthen the production responsibility system at all levels and overcome the phenomenon of rework and waste of labor in production. Implementing quota management is also one of the important methods for the commune to improve labor productivity. At present, the commune has fully implemented the quota management system, which has achieved good results. For example, in the past, the Houliu Production Team could only water the wheat once in ten days. After the implementation of quotas, they watered the wheat once in eight days, improving work efficiency by 20%. Some commune members exceeded the quota by 5% to 15%.
    There are now several methods for setting quotas: one is the small-section quota system, that is, the temporary quota is flexibly stipulated according to the current task. The advantage is that it is easy to formulate and modify flexibly, but it must be followed by an inspection and acceptance system. The second is the one-package-to-the-end quota system, that is, the task of accumulating fertilizer for a crop growing season or a quarter is fully contracted, and several comparisons and inspections are carried out in the middle. This method can give full play to the initiative and flexibility of the contractor and reduce the administrative work of cadres. The third method is the "grading by work" (that is, grading each person monthly according to the number of completed quotas) and "work by grade" (giving different quotas according to different grades) proposed by the masses of Sun Huamen Production Team. After discussion, most commune members agreed to the former method because it can give play to the enthusiasm and potential of commune members. For example, Sun Yiqing, an old man, said: "Although I am a third grade, I want to use the first method, and I may not do less than young people." The disadvantage of the latter method is that it is easy to produce the phenomenon of completing the quota.
    In order to ensure the attendance rate, each production team has established an attendance system. At present, most production teams adopt the method of deducting one day's wages for one day's absenteeism.
    Improve fertilizer accumulation and production methods, improve fertilizer quality, increase fine fertilizer, and reduce transportation volume.
    According to the commune's estimate, fertilizer labor generally accounts for 20% to 30% of the total annual agricultural labor. The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production requires a multiple increase in fertilizer application, but most of the fertilizers are coarse fertilizers and very few are fine fertilizers; therefore, the amount of labor consumed for fertilizer accumulation and transportation is very large. In 1958, Hongguang Commune applied 11,000 jin of coarse fertilizer and 26 jin of fine fertilizer per mu; a total of 139.7 million jin of coarse fertilizer and 3.3 million jin of fine fertilizer were applied throughout the year. According to the plan, in 1959, 31,000 jin of coarse fertilizer and 2,719 jin of fine fertilizer should be applied per mu. A total of 361.46 million jin of coarse fertilizer and 31.704 million jin of fine fertilizer will be applied throughout the year, an increase of 1.6 times compared with 1958; fine fertilizer will increase by 95 times compared with 1958 (accounting for 8% of the total fertilizer application in 1959). From the perspective of fertilizer transportation volume, the increase in the volume of coarse fertilizer alone will be 1.6 times that of 1958. Obviously, according to such a ratio of coarse and fine fertilizers, the total annual fertilizer application will increase by multiples, and the labor force for fertilizer alone will make the rural labor force more and more tight. Therefore, how to improve fertilizer accumulation and production methods, improve fertilizer quality, and increase fine fertilizer has become an important aspect of alleviating rural labor tension.
    Hongguang Commune mainly adopted the following two methods:
    The first is to vigorously develop local chemical fertilizers to replace some coarse fertilizers with fine fertilizers. From the end of 1958 to February of this year, 129 local fertilizer factories have been established in the commune, and "teams are producing chemical fertilizers and villages are establishing chemical fertilizer factories" has been achieved. This year, we also plan to expand the scale of production, and plan to produce 300 million jin of fertilizer throughout the year (55.2 million jin have been produced). These 300 million jin of local chemical fertilizer can be converted into 2.9 billion jin of coarse fertilizer, which can save about 30,000 fertilizer transportation workdays throughout the year. It can be seen that this mass movement of vigorously developing local chemical fertilizer is an important way to improve fertilizer quality and alleviate rural labor tension.
    The second is to promote on-site fertilizer accumulation and try to raise pigs in the fields. One of the reasons for the rural labor shortage is the excessive transportation volume of coarse fertilizer. In order to reduce the transportation volume of coarse fertilizer, all production teams in the commune have adopted the method of accumulating and producing fertilizer (fumigating fertilizer, composting miscellaneous fertilizer) at the head of the field and applying it on the spot. According to estimates, the entire commune accumulated a total of 1.166 million jin of fertilizer in one winter, which can reduce the number of fertilizer transportation workdays throughout the year by more than 40,000; if we calculate the transportation of raw materials back to the village, mud paving the pens, and adopt the method of accumulating and producing fertilizer at the head of the field and applying it on the spot, it will use three-quarters less manpower than in the past. Of course, this kind of fertilizer accumulation at the head of the field often ferments slowly and has poor fertilizer efficiency, and it is also necessary to pay attention to improving the quality of fertilizer accumulation. In addition, Zhang'an Village is experimenting with pig farms in the fields. If it can be promoted in the future, it will also be a way to save fertilizer transportation labor.
    Gradually implement male-female substitution and weak-strong substitution in the living service departments and non-agricultural production personnel, and give full play to the role of female labor, auxiliary labor, and other social manpower in production.
    In order to increase the number of young and middle-aged laborers as much as possible, Hongguang Commune is gradually implementing the method of male-female substitution and weak-strong substitution in the living service departments and non-agricultural production personnel. From the distribution of labor in the commune's factories and institutions: among the 3,513 laborers in industry, supply and marketing cooperatives, canteens, livestock breeding, accounting, sewing and shoe making, hairdressing, post and telecommunications offices, happiness homes, kindergartens, and maternity hospitals, there are 3,065 young and middle-aged full laborers, accounting for 87.3% (of which: male laborers are 1,690, accounting for 55.15% of the number of young and middle-aged, and female laborers are 1,375, accounting for 44.85%). After the adjustment, 720 young and middle-aged full laborers can be replaced, and the proportion of young and middle-aged laborers will drop from the original 87.3% to 66.75% (of which: male laborers will drop from 55.15% to 23.65%; female laborers will rise from 44.85% to 76.35%). Most of the 720 young and middle-aged laborers replaced after the adjustment are male. In this way, a group of backbone forces can be added to the agricultural production front. At present, the commune is gradually carrying out the replacement.
    After the establishment of the commune, the collectivization of life and the partial mutual assistance of nurseries and the mechanization of sewing freed up a large number of young and middle-aged female laborers and auxiliary laborers to participate in production. However, nurseries and kindergartens have not yet been universally established. According to a survey by the Sixth Management Area, there are a total of 1,806 children aged one to seven in the area, and 897 have been admitted to nurseries, accounting for 49.6%; there are still 909 children at home, which prevents more than 300 women from participating in labor regularly. If they are all admitted to nurseries and kindergartens, more than 200 women (accounting for 10% of the total female labor force in the management area) can be completely liberated to participate in production regularly. In addition, the establishment of sewing and shoe-making factories is also an important aspect of thoroughly liberating women. At present, about 70% to 80% of the clothes are made by hand; shoe-making is basically still relying on the manual labor of each household. This cannot but affect the labor attendance rate of women. According to a random inspection in Zhanghutou Village on November 8, 1958, 18 women asked for leave to make clothes. From the perspective of the entire commune, taking sewing clothes as an example, women generally only make one piece of clothing a day by hand; while they can make six pieces a day by machine, and the work efficiency is increased by five times. The entire commune has 46,800 people. If calculated by making one and a half sets of clothes per person per year, using machines can save more than 110,000 workdays compared with using hand labor.
    With the liberation of a large number of women from housework and their participation in production, the proportion of female labor in the entire labor force is rising rapidly, and their role in production is becoming more and more important. However, due to insufficient practical experience in the past, generally speaking, their technical level and labor proficiency are poor, and the work efficiency is low. Therefore, how to rapidly improve the technical level and labor proficiency of this group of female laborers from all aspects has become an important issue in rural labor organization and management.
    During the busy farming season, mobilizing and organizing non-agricultural production labor and other social manpower to participate in production also has a certain effect on alleviating the seasonal special labor tension. According to the survey, the entire commune has 10,348 non-agricultural production personnel, including office cadres, students, workers, supply and marketing, canteens, post and telecommunications, and hospitals. If half of the office cadres and personnel of various institutions participate in one month of labor during the busy farming season, and the students are calculated according to the prescribed compulsory labor time (lower grade students are 50% off, and higher grade students are 30% off), then a total of 120,000 workdays can be added throughout the year.
    Strengthening Party Leadership and Fully Mobilizing the Masses is the Guarantee for Improving Labor Enthusiasm and Solving the Labor Shortage Problem
    Strengthening Party leadership, implementing political command, fully mobilizing the masses, and following the mass line are the fundamental guarantees for improving the labor enthusiasm of commune members, realizing the above measures to improve work efficiency, and thus smoothly solving the labor shortage problem. Through investigation, we deeply feel that only by strengthening Party leadership, implementing political command, and conducting in-depth socialist and communist education among cadres and commune members, criticizing various erroneous ideas, and enabling everyone to clarify the direction ideologically and identify the advantages and disadvantages, can we continuously improve the ideological awareness and labor enthusiasm of commune members, and dare to overcome various difficulties and complete production tasks. Since the Great Leap Forward, countless facts on the production front have powerfully proved that as long as the Party leadership is strengthened and political command is implemented, the ideological awareness and revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses will rise, and many arduous tasks that seem impossible to complete can be overfulfilled. For example, in order to basically realize water conservancy on more than 2,300 mu of land, Pangjia Temple Village planned to dig 192 earthen wells from last winter to this spring. At that time, the weather was cold and the ground was frozen, and the water was cold and biting, and there were many difficulties. However, because the leadership insisted on the principle of "politics first before troops and horses move" in everything, and the ideological mobilization work was done well, the enthusiasm of the masses was soaring and their fighting spirit was high. The original stipulation was that two people would dig a well in two days, but the result was that it was completed in less than two days. In about a month, the masses of the whole village dug a total of 192 earthen wells, 135 brick wells, and also built three small reservoirs. For another example, in the fourth quarter of 1958, the labor input of Pangjia Temple Village increased more than three times compared with the same period in the past, and the contradiction between heavy tasks and insufficient labor was very large. However, because Comrade Liu Qinghe, the secretary of the village Party branch, personally took the lead, studied and discussed the significance of the technological revolution with the masses, and mobilized everyone to think of ways, the sweet potato slicer with a daily output of 20,000 jin, as well as deep plowing plows, ridge adjustment boards, and automated vertical mills were created, which greatly alleviated the labor shortage.
    In last year's production campaign, some teams had such shortcomings: when production was busy and labor was tight, they "couldn't take care of" or relaxed the political and ideological work and meeting with the masses to discuss matters. This seems to give the masses more time to work, but it is not the case. As some commune members said: "Sometimes only five minutes of meeting, just assigning tasks, not explaining the reasons, everyone's mind is not clear, how can they do more work?" Indeed, in some villages, when the commune members did not believe that deep plowing could increase production, the digging efficiency was only 0.04 mu per person per day, while after the branch led the masses to debate "why deep plowing?" After everyone realized the great significance of increasing wheat production, the plowing efficiency rose to more than 0.2 mu per person per day, and the quality was guaranteed. This shows that the busier the production and the tighter the labor, the more important it is not to relax the political work and follow the mass line. Doing so seems to "delay" the labor time, but in fact it will greatly save labor time.
    Carrying out comparisons and competitions is an important part of political work, and it has a great effect on inspiring the labor enthusiasm of the masses and improving labor efficiency. In the tense production tasks after the communization, Hongguang Commune found that the work was generally generalized, and immediately launched a competition for striving for the upper reaches and vying for the red flag in the six management areas, which increased the deep plowing from 650 mu per day to 2,600 mu, winning the county championship. Now learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced have become the action slogans of the commune members. "Planting good parasol trees to welcome the phoenix" has become a beautiful story of commune members wanting to see Chairman Mao.

    随着1958年工农业生产的大跃进，农村出现了劳动力空前紧张的情况。1959年是我国苦战三年中有决定意义的一年，工农业生产将继续大跃进，劳动力紧张和进一步大跃进的需要不相适应的矛盾也就更加突出。合理地安排使用劳动力，提高劳动生产率就成为当前农村的一个极其重要的问题。为了了解农村劳动力紧张的情况和解决劳动力不足的办法，我们在河北省宁津县红光人民公社作了一些初步的调查。
    红光人民公社地处平原，全社九十五个村，一万一千二百九十四户，四万六千八百七十二人，其中整劳动力九千七百六十个，半劳动力九千一百九十八个，耕地十二万七千六百亩，平均每个劳力负担八点八亩。
    该社自1958年生产大跃进以来，在劳动力需求上出现相当紧张的现象。1958年农业总用工数是三百六十六万个，按过去劳力出工情况计算，当时只能提供二百五十万五千个，还缺工一百一十五万五千个，占农业总用工数的31％。
    为什么劳动力会这样紧张呢？从红光社的情况来看，主要有这样几个原因：
    一、种植作物精耕细作程度的提高和再生产规模的扩大，需要投入更多的劳动量。该社在1958年积极地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。以深翻土地一项来看，1958年就比1957年多用十七万五千五百个工，增长九倍。
　　要求耕深质量  平均每亩用工量（工／亩）  全社用工（个）
　　1957年  1958年增长％  1957年  1958年增长％  1957年  1958年增％长
　　深耕  4—5寸  1—1.5尺  125—2000.2—0.32—390019，500195，000900
    （注：1957年全部是犁耕；1958年33％用深耕犁耕，25％用拖拉机耕，42％人掘。）
    各种主要作物的栽培也都较以前增加了用工量。下面是1958年与1957年几种作物每亩平均用工数的比较：（单位：工／亩）
　　年份  小麦  棉花  甘薯  玉米
　　1957年  1.5  15  15  14
　　1958年  7  25  2  1.5  17.5
　　增长％  366  66  43  25
    （注：小麦亩用工指播种至封冻前一个阶段内的每亩用工数。）
    在各项措施中，“水”、“肥”、“土”三项用工量增加的最多。如该社西曹村生产队小麦“水”、“肥”、“土”三项两三年来每亩平均用工增加的情况如下：（单位：工／亩）措　施56—57年57—58年58—59年（计划）增　长水06121倍（58—59年与57—58年比）肥1.56127倍（58—59年与56—57年比）土0.5159倍（58—59年与56—57年比）
    此外，该社在1958年的农田基本建设方面也用了不少工。据不完全的统计，在兴修水利方面（包括修水库、水渠、水塘、打机井等）就用了十七万三千五百个工，占农业总用工的4.7％以上。
    二、支援国家工业建设和发展社办工业、进行多种经营及部分劳力外迁外流，使农业劳动力数量下降和劳动力的结构发生变化。1958年9月至12月，该社共抽调了一千九百八十六个青壮劳动力分赴承德、天津、邯郸、内蒙古等地支援国家工业建设，又抽调了一千零二十一名青壮劳动力转入社办工业；又抽调了一千零二十一名转入多种经济，另有四百多个劳动力外迁外流。这不仅使公社劳动力数量下降，而且引起结构变化，因而使农业劳动力更加紧张。
　　1958年9—12月全社劳动力结构变化
　　1958年9月占总劳动力比重  1958年12月占总劳动力比重  增减％
　　男  整  35  25  －10
        半  15  16  ＋1
　　女  整半  34  32  －2  16  27  ＋11
    此外，由于人民公社刚成立不久，新的劳动组织和管理制度还没有建立和健全起来，因而在劳动力的安排使用上还不够完善，还存在窝工、浪费的现象。如去年第六管理区在小麦播种时，因没有按照党委要求的规格进行调畦，结果调畦后不能浇水。全区又动员了50％的劳动力，用了二至三天的时间重新调畦，浪费了四至六千个工。类似的情形还有不少。
    劳动力紧张给生产带来了困难，但它也大大地促进了生产
    劳动力紧张，是公社生产大跃进中遇到的一个困难。但是它也反映了人民公社生产建设的突飞猛进和宏伟规模。正如刘少奇同志所说的：“……在我们六亿多人口的大国中感到了劳动力紧张，证明我国的工农业生产正在大发展，国民经济正在一日千里地繁荣起来”。从红光社可以清楚地看到，1958年的生产大跃进固然使劳动力很紧张，但这种紧张却带来了非常丰硕的果实。全社粮食作物平均亩产一千二百一十二斤，比1957年（平均亩产四百一十斤）增长196％。随着农产品的增加，公社的公共积累增多，达到一百四十万八千元。公社办起了机械厂、电机厂、化肥厂等大小二百四十六个工厂，制造出了柴油机、电动机、水泵等许多机器，1958年产值达到一百一十四万六千六百元。
    此外，劳动力的紧张，对于下面几件事还起了很大的促进作用：（一）促进了人人劳动、各尽所能这一原则的实现，基本上做到了使所有的人都参加力所能及的劳动。1957年时，许多村还感到劳动力有些过剩，有时社员向队长要活干，而队长感到活少人多没法安排。1958年大跃进以来，根本改变了这种状况，真可以说是达到了“个个都劳动，户户无闲人”的程度。如庞家寺生产队过去出勤率仅为60％，而到1958年后期，则经常达到百分之百。（二）促进了妇女的彻底解放，使广大妇女在公社成立的食堂、托儿所、缝纫组等公共福利事业的帮助之下，摆脱了繁琐的家务事，而出来从事公社的生产劳动。妇女劳动力的这种解放，不仅给生产战线增加了生力军，而且由于参加劳动之后各自领得工资，经济上得到独立，她们在社会上和家庭中的地位也进一步提高了。（三）推动了群众性的工具改革运动。红光公社在1958年共制造、改制、修配和推广了各种农具（包括提水工具、运输工具）七千五百四十六件，这些工具一般提高工效从半倍到十几倍。如1958年收甘薯的任务很大，时间紧，劳力少；然而在这种形势逼迫之下，群众很快地将双铧犁、深耕犁改装为刨薯工具，比用镐刨提高工效三倍以上，解决了当务之急。仅仅这一项就节省五万余工。（四）劳动力的不足，就要求劳动力的充分合理的利用，提高工作效率。正是在这种形势要求下，公社很快实现了组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化；大协作、劳动专业队等新的劳动组织形式也相继产生。这不仅提高了劳动效率，而且锻炼和加强了农民群众的组织性、纪律性。
    广大社员对劳动力紧张的意义是理解的。社员们说：“忙是好事，有活干，才有饱饭吃。”“日本鬼子占东三省时，工人失了业，不忙；旧社会要饭的、无地的，不忙；可谁愿意过那种日子？”“在旧社会是忙着给地主富农扛活、打短工。现在是忙着大跃进、大建设，给自己的幸福生活打基础，怎能不高兴！”
    尽管如此，劳动力的紧张，也给生产带来不少困难，例如去年的秋收工作，就因劳力不足而有些粗糙，秋收“尾巴”拖得较长，影响了作物的实际收获量。如因甘薯和棉收得较粗糙，丢到地里很多，后经复收得甘薯一百六十五万斤，棉花十七万六千斤；花生也因收获不及时，受冻达五十多万斤，因此而降低了出油率的11％。另外，还有少数甘薯、花生损失在地里。红光人民公社为了进一步提高劳动生产率，解决任务大和劳力不足的矛盾，采取以下一些办法：
    解决劳动力不足的几项办法
    首先，根据今年的生产计划要对全社的劳动力摸底算账，进行全面的、适当的安排，在保证农业增产所需的劳动力的同时，也要保证发展副业、工业和生活服务等方面所需的劳动力。
    大搞工具改革和技术革命
    浇水是红光公社用工较多的农活之一。现在主要是靠水车（还有少数用辘轳），机井很少。辘轳每人每天浇半亩，水车每人每日浇零点七至一亩，而机井比水车效率高九倍。浇小麦，若按一年浇十二水计算，辘轳亩用工需二十四个，水车需十五个，而机井只用一点五个就够了。全社即将投入生产的七十六眼机井，和1959年下半年将投入生产的五十眼机井，全年共可节省二十万五千个工。再加上计划改造动力水车四百架，及其它提水工具，全年可节省八万个工。前后两项共节省二十八万五千个工，就可解决全年农业缺工数的28％以上。
    深耕地也是用工量较多的一项农活。掘一点五尺深，每人每天能掘一点五分多地，用深耕犁一天可耕一点五至二亩。1959年能制造深耕犁六百张，再加上计划增加三台拖拉机深耕地，全年可节省八万一千三百个工。
    随着施肥量的增加，运输量越来越大。人挑日工作量为一千八百市斤华里；手推车比人挑提高零点七七倍（日工作量为三千二百市斤华里）；胶轮车比铁轮车提高一倍（前者日工作量二万市斤华里，后者为一万市斤华里），如把铁轮车换上轴承，可以比原来提高半倍。1959年计划制造七百套轴承，可节省工二万六千个。全社准备增加二千辆手推车，可节省六万四千个工，加上七十辆胶轮车和三十部拖车，总共可节省十万二千四百个工。
    薯、米加工占用人力也很大，全社二百六十七个磨面厂，占用四百零四个人，二百六十七个牲口，全年用十三万三千多个工，八万八千个畜工。全社如果使用庞家寺创造的动力磨，只要五至六台就够用了。每台日磨五千斤以上，按推广一半算，可节省人工六万五千七百个，畜工四万四千个。
    全社还计划其它工具改革，如铡草机、浇稀水车、密植宽幅耧、食堂用具、补苗器等中小工具二万件，可节省十五万个工。
    据该社计算，进行工具改革，可以节省六十八万四千多个工，解决总缺工数的67.7％。
    改善劳动组织与管理，提高工效。
    全社除去对各方面事业进行了劳力安排以外，还在春节前进行了一次大规模的划区调地工作，共划分了一百一十三个生产方，调整了劳力少、土地多和劳力多、土地少的不平衡现象。如龙谭村，每个劳动力平均负担三点八九亩，而大郭庄每个劳动力平均负担九亩，相差一点三倍。经过这次调整，土地和劳力的分配达到了平衡；同时使90％以上村的土地靠近了生产队。龙谭村最远的土地离村五至六里，现在最远的不超过三里，这就避免了许多劳动时间的浪费，社员们说：“不用说送粪和往家拉庄稼，就是来回走路，可以省多少工啊！”“从前一天能送四车粪，现在能送十车以上，再也不愁送粪难了。”在划区的基础上进行了劳动力编队工作，根据生产需要和量才使用的原则，各生产队组织了专业队。专业队在统一领导下，分工合作。专业组织便于钻研和熟练业务，能够提高工作效率和加强责任心。西曹村组织专业队后，临时等着派工的现象没有了，组长摆脱了事务主义，钻研了业务，同时也易于固定农活和包工。
    加强责任制，推行定额管理，既可减少浪费，也可以加强工效。过去有些管理区和生产队对责任制贯彻不够，造成部分人力上的浪费。如第六管理区1958年因种麦不够规格而毁种了二百四十七亩，每亩浪费六至七个工，共损失一千四百至一千七百多个工；需要补苗的四百多亩，每亩用四至五个工，共多用一千六百至二千个工。而有些生产队加强了责任制后，就取得了良好的效果。如铁杨庄在浇麦时，进行小包干办法，责任确定到人，公社要求十天完成浇麦工作，该队六天就完成了。有些社员不打钟就下地干活，社员杨玉良怕落在后面跑着下地。为了加强责任制，该社在整编生产队，划分耕作区，进行四固定（固定耕地、劳力、牲畜、农具）的基础上，实行了“三定一奖”制，即定跃进指标、定上交任务、定投资开支，实行三级核算，对超产者和节约者实行奖励。生产队对小组实行四到田（措施到田、指标到田、责任到田、管理到田），小组对社员实行了四定（定项目、任务、质量、时间）。这样可以逐级加强生产责任制，克服生产上返工和浪费劳动力的现象。进行定额管理也是该社提高劳动生产率的重要方法之一。目前该社已全面推行了定额管理制度，已收到了好的效果。如后刘生产队以前浇麦，十天才能浇完一遍水。实行定额后，八天浇完了一遍水，提高工效20％。部分社员超过定额的5％至15％。
    在制定额当中现在有几种方法：一种是小段定额制，即根据当前任务，灵活规定临时定额，好处是制订容易，修改灵活，但必须跟上检查验收制度。另一种是一包到底的定额制，即按一种作物生长期或一个季度的积肥任务，全包下去，中间进行几次评比检查，这种方法能发挥被包者的主动性灵活性，减轻干部的事务工作。第三种办法是孙华门生产队群众提出的“以工定级”（即每人每月按完成定额数评级）和“以级定工”（按不同级别给不同的定额）。这两种方法经讨论大部分社员同意前一种，因为它能发挥社员的积极性和潜力，如孙义青老大爷说：“我虽然是三级，要用第一种办法，不一定比青年人少干”。后一种方法的缺点是易于产生完成定额了事的现象。
    为了保证出勤率，各生产队都建立了考勤制度。目前大部分生产队采用旷工一天，扣罚一天工资的办法。
    改进积肥造肥办法，提高肥料质量，增加细肥，减少运输量。
    据该社估算，肥料用工一般要占全年农业总用工量的20％至30％。农业生产的大跃进，要求成倍地增施肥料，而肥料中绝大部分是粗肥，细肥很少；因而积肥运肥所消耗的劳动量甚大。红光公社1958年每亩施粗肥一万一千斤，细肥二十六斤；全年共施粗肥十三万九千七百万斤，细肥三百三十万斤。按计划，1959年每亩要施粗肥三万一千斤，细肥二千七百一十九斤。全年共施粗肥三十六万一千四百六十万斤，比1958年增长一点六倍；细肥三万一千七百零四万斤，比1958年增长九十五倍（占1959年总施肥数的8％）。从肥料运输量来看，只粗肥一项就要比1958年增长一点六倍。显然按照这样的粗细肥比例，每年总施肥量又成倍地增长，单肥料一项用工就会使得农村劳动力愈来愈紧张。因此，如何改进积肥造肥办法，提高肥料质量，增加细肥，就越来越成为缓和农村劳力紧张的一个重要方面。
    红光公社主要采用了下面两种办法：
    一是大搞土化肥，以细肥代替部分粗肥。全社1958年底到今年2月，已办起土肥厂一百二十九个，已经做到“队队造化肥，村村建立化肥厂”。今年还准备扩大生产规模，全年计划造肥三亿斤（现已生产出五千五百二十万斤）。这三亿斤土化肥，可以折合粗肥二十九亿斤，全年大约能节省运肥工三万个。可见，这种群众性的大搞土化肥运动，是提高肥料质量、缓和农村劳动力紧张的一个重要途径。
    二是推广就地积肥，试行养猪到田。农村劳动力紧张的原因之一，是粗肥运输量过大。为了减少粗肥的运输量，全公社各个生产队都采用了地头积肥造肥（熏肥、沤杂肥），就地施用的办法。据估算，全公社一个冬天共积肥一百一十六万六千斤，可以减少全年运肥工四万多个；如果再计算上运送原料回村，泥土垫圈，采用地头积肥造肥、就地施用的方法，比过去要少用四分之三的人工。当然，这种地头积肥，往往发酵慢，肥效差，还需要注意提高积肥质量。另外，张安村正在试行养猪场到田。将来如能加以推广，也是节省运肥用工的一个办法。
    在生活服务部门和非农业生产人员中逐步实行抽男换女，以弱代强，充分发挥妇女劳力、辅助劳力和其它社会人力在生产上的作用。
    为了尽可能增加青壮年劳动力，红光公社正在生活服务部门和非农业生产人员中逐步实行抽男换女，以弱代强的办法。从全公社各工厂、事业单位劳动力的分配情况来看：在工业、供销社、食堂、牲畜饲养、会计、缝纫制鞋、理发、邮电所、幸福院、幼儿园、妇产院等部门的三千五百一十三个劳动力中，青壮年全劳动力有三千零六十五个，占87.3％（其中：男劳动力一千六百九十个，占青壮年数的55.15％，女劳动力一千三百七十五个，占44.85％）。经过调整，可以换出青壮年全劳动力七百二十人，青壮年劳动力所占的比重将从原有的87.3％降到66.75％（其中：男劳动力从55.15％降到23.65％；女劳动力从44.85％升到76.35％）。调整后换出的七百二十个青壮年劳动力中，大部分是男的。这样，就可以使农业生产战线增加一批骨干力量。目前，公社正在逐步进行调换。
    成立公社以后，实行了生活集体化和部分托儿互助化、缝纫机械化，解放出一大批青壮年妇女劳动力和辅助劳动力参加生产。但现在托儿所、幼儿园还没有普遍地建立起来。据第六管理区调查，全区一至七岁的小孩共一千八百零六个，已入托的八百九十七个，占49.6％；还有九百零九个孩子在家，他们要使三百多个妇女不能经常参加劳动。如果使他们全部入托儿所和幼儿园，就可以完全解放出二百多个妇女（占管理区妇女劳动力总数的10％），经常参加生产。此外，建立缝纫做鞋工厂，也是彻底解放妇女的一个重要方面。目前约有70％至80％的衣服是用手工做；做鞋基本上还是靠一家一户的手工劳动。这就不能不影响妇女的劳动出勤率。据1958年11月8日在张户头村抽查，有十八个妇女请假做衣服。从全公社来看，仅以缝衣为例，一般妇女用手工一天只做一件单衣；而用机器一天可做六件，工效提高五倍。全公社四万六千八百口人，以每人一年做一套半衣服计算，用机器比用手工可节省十一万多个工。
    随着大批妇女从家务事中解放出来参加生产，妇女劳力在整个劳动力中所占的比重迅速上升，她们在生产上的作用也愈来愈大。但是，由于过去的实践经验不够，一般说她们技术水平和劳动熟练程度较差，工效较低。因此，如何从各方面迅速提高这批妇女劳动力的技术水平和劳动熟练程度，就越来越成为农村劳动组织和管理中的一个重要问题。
    农忙时，动员和组织非农业生产劳动力以及其它社会人力参加生产，对于缓和季节性的劳动力特殊紧张，也有一定的作用。据调查，全公社有机关干部、学生、工人、供销、食堂、邮电、医院等非农业生产人员一万零三百四十八人。机关干部和各事业单位的人员，按农忙季节抽二分之一的人参加一个月的劳动，学生按规定义务劳动时间计算（低年级学生五折一，高年级学生三折一），则全年共可增加十二万个工。
    加强党的领导充分发动群众是提高劳动积极性、解决劳动力紧张问题的保证
    加强党的领导、实行政治挂帅、充分发动群众、走好群众路线，这是提高社员劳动积极性、实现以上几项提高工效措施、从而顺利解决劳动力紧张问题的根本保证。我们通过调查深深感到，只有加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，在干部和社员中深入地进行社会主义和共产主义教育，批判各种错误思想，使大家从思想上明确方向，识别利害，才能不断提高社员的思想觉悟和劳动热情，勇于克服各种困难，完成生产任务。大跃进以来，生产战线上的无数事实，都有力地证明了只要加强了党的领导、实行了政治挂帅，群众的思想觉悟和革命干劲高涨起来，许多看起来不能完成的艰巨任务都能超额完成。如去冬今春庞家寺村为了使二千三百多亩地基本上实现水利化，计划打一百九十二眼土井。当时天寒地冻，水冷刺骨，困难很多。但是由于领导上事事坚持“兵马未动，政治先行”的原则，思想发动工作做得较好，群众的干劲冲天，斗志昂扬。原规定两人两天打一眼井，结果却不到两天就完成了。全村群众在前后一个月的时间，共打了一百九十二眼土井，一百三十五眼砖井，还修了三个小水库。又如庞家寺村1958年第四季用工量较过去同一时期增加三倍以上，任务重与劳力不足之间的矛盾甚大。但由于村党支部书记刘清河同志亲自挂帅，同群众一起研究、讨论技术革命的意义，发动大家想办法，结果造出了日切二万斤的甘薯切片机及深耕犁、调畦板、自动化立磨等工具，大大缓和了劳动力的紧张状况。
    在去年的生产运动中，有些队存在这样的缺点：生产一忙、劳力一紧张就“顾不得”或放松了做政治思想工作和有事开会同群众商量。这样好像可以使群众有更多的时间干活，实际不然。正如有的社员说：“有时只开五分钟的会，光交任务，不讲道理，大家心里不亮堂，怎么能多干活？”的确是这样，有的村当社员不相信深翻地能增产的思想没有解决的时候，掘地效率每人每天只四厘，而当支部领导群众辩论了“为什么要深翻地？”大家认识到小麦增产的重大意义之后，翻地效率就上升到每人每天挖二分以上，并保证了质量。这就说明，越是生产忙，劳力紧，就越不能放松做政治工作和走群众路线。这样做，好像是“耽误”了劳动时间，实际上却会大大节省劳动时间。
    开展评比竞赛，是政治工作的一项重要内容，对于鼓舞群众的劳动热情和提高劳动效率有极大的作用。红光公社在公社化后的紧张生产任务中，发现工作一般化，立即在六个管理区中展开了力争上游、争夺红旗的竞赛，使深翻地由日进六百五十亩提高到二千六百亩，赢得了全县的冠军。现在学先进、赶先进、超先进，已经成为社员们的行动口号。“种好梧桐树，迎接凤凰来”，成了社员们想见毛主席的互相传闻的佳话。
