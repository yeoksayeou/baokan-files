    Fish That Can Live Out of Water
    Some fish live outside of water. Lungfish from Australia, Africa, and the Americas are like this.
    These fish also have ordinary gills for breathing, but they can also inhale, or rather swallow, air and pass it through the intestines into an air bladder that replaces the lungs. Interestingly, during completely dry seasons, African lungfish hide in the mud, forming a thick mud shell around themselves, with a breathing hole at one end of the shell.
    Once, someone transported a mud shell containing a lungfish to Europe. When the mud shell dissolved in warm water, the fish lived in a tank for several more years.

    能够离水生活的鱼
    有些鱼是在水外生活的。如澳洲、非洲、美洲的肺鱼就是这样。
    这些鱼也有一般的鳃呼吸，但是它们也能够吸进去、或者说吞进去空气，通过肠子而进入代替肺的鳔。有趣的是，在完全干旱的季节里，非洲肺鱼藏在泥中，在它周围形成厚的泥壳，在口的一端的壳上有呼吸孔。
    有一次有人将这种包有肺鱼的泥壳运入欧洲，当泥壳在温暖的水中溶解，鱼在缸中又生活了好几年。
