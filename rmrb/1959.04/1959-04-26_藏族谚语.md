Tibetan Proverbs

If you don't teach him a lesson when he steals a rooster, he will steal a horse in the future.

If it is a white horse, it does not wear black tassels,
If it is a good person, he will not be slandered.

A hundred good friends are few, but one bad friend is many.

Your enemy is carrying a knife, don't allow him anything.

    藏族谚语
    在偷公鸡的时候不给一点教训，将来他会偷马。
    是白马不挂黑缨，
    是好人不受诬蔑。
    益友百人少，坏友一人多。
    你的敌人带着刀，不要允许他什么。
