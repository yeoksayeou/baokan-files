Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: The State Statistical Bureau published the "Communique on the Development of the National Economy in 1958" on the 14th. The communique stated that 1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward in China's industrial and agricultural production. In this year, the nation's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 65% compared to the previous year; the output of major industrial and agricultural products such as steel, iron, coal, grain, and cotton all increased by about 100% compared to the previous year; the total amount of investment in basic construction greatly exceeded any previous year. Amid the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, China's rural areas have victoriously realized people's communes on the basis of agricultural cooperativization, and the lives of the peasant masses have been reliably guaranteed.

The communique first discussed the achievements of China's industrial production in 1958. The communique stated that in 1958, China's steel production (including some native steel) reached 11.08 million tons, more than doubling the previous year; pig iron production (including some native iron) reached 13.69 million tons, an increase of 131% over the previous year. The great achievement of doubling steel production in this year was achieved through the heroic struggle of the people across the country. Driven by the iron and steel industry, the speed of overall industrial production development in 1958 exceeded any year since liberation. The total industrial output value (including handicrafts) increased by 66% compared to 1957, and the output of 32 major industrial products all increased significantly compared to the previous year.

The communique said that the scale and speed of basic construction in 1958 greatly exceeded any previous year. The total amount of basic construction investment completed nationwide was 26.7 billion yuan, equivalent to half of the total investment during the First Five-Year Plan period. In 1958, basic construction investment was concentrated more on industrial construction. There were more than 1,000 industrial and mining enterprises above the quota under construction throughout the year, and about 700 were fully or partially completed and put into production, including 45 major construction projects under Soviet aid. Regarding agricultural production, the communique stated that China's agricultural production achieved high yields and bumper harvests in 1958. The total grain output reached 750 billion jin, doubling the previous year. The total cotton output reached 66.38 million dan, doubling the previous year. The output of other major crops also increased significantly compared to the previous year. In 1958, the national average grain yield per mu (calculated by sown area) was 412 jin, and the average cotton yield per mu was 77 jin. Calculated by cultivated land area, in 1958, many counties and cities across the country had achieved ahead of schedule the targets stipulated in the Twelve-Year National Program for Agricultural Development for annual grain yields of 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin per mu respectively; many cotton-producing areas also reached the requirement of 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin of cotton per mu ahead of schedule.

Regarding transportation and postal and telecommunications work, the communique stated that in 1958, 55 new railway lines were under construction one after another, and 29 existing lines were undergoing double-tracking or reconstruction. Including enterprise special lines, the total railway track laying mileage throughout the year reached 3,564 kilometers, more than double the previous year. A total of 150,000 kilometers of new roads (including simple roads) were built throughout the year, more than seven times the previous year. The inland waterway navigable mileage improved and newly added throughout the year reached 10,000 kilometers. In 1958, the volume of postal and telecommunications services nationwide increased by 41% compared to the previous year.

The last two parts of the communique are domestic and foreign commerce and the material and cultural life of the people. The communique stated that in 1958, the national average number of employees reached more than 32 million, an increase of approximately 8 million over the previous year. The ranks of employees expanded unprecedentedly, and the phenomenon of unemployment left over from the old society has been eliminated. At the same time, after the people's communes, due to the socialization of housework, approximately tens of millions of female laborers across the country participated in social labor. With the development of production and construction and the increase in the number of employed people, the purchasing power of the Chinese people was further developed in 1958, and market prices remained stable throughout.

The communique finally stated that the great achievements made by all fronts of socialist construction in China in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 are the result of the people of the country's efforts to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and heroic labor; at the same time, it is also inseparable from the assistance of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. On the basis of the great achievements in 1958, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the country are working hard to strive for new victories in the continued Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in 1959.

　　一九五八年大跃进是总路线的伟大胜利
　　全国工农业总产值一年增长百分之六十五，农村已实现人民公社化
    新华社14日讯　国家统计局14日发表了“关于1958年国民经济发展情况的公报”。公报说，1958年是我国工农业生产大跃进的一年。这一年全国工农业总产值比上年增长65％；钢、铁、煤炭、粮食、棉花等主要工农业产品的产量，都比上年增长了一倍左右；基本建设投资总额大大地超过了以往任何一年。在工农业生产大跃进的形势下，我国农村在农业合作化的基础上，已经胜利地实现了人民公社化，农民群众生活有了可靠的保证。
    公报首先谈到了1958年我国工业生产的成就。公报说，1958年我国的钢产量（包括一部分土钢）达到1，108万吨，比上年增长一倍以上；生铁产量（包括一部分土铁）达到1，369万吨，比上年增长1.31倍。钢铁产量在这一年里实现翻一番的伟大成就，是经过全国人民群众的英勇奋斗而取得的。在钢铁工业的带动下，1958年整个工业生产发展的速度超过了解放以来的任何一年。工业总产值（包括手工业）比1957年增长了66％，三十二种主要工业产品产量都比上年增长很多。
    公报说，1958年基本建设的规模和速度大大地超过了以往任何一年。全国完成基本建设投资总额267亿元，相当于第一个五年计划期间投资总额的一半。1958年基本建设投资较多地集中在工业建设方面，全年施工的限额以上工矿企业共有1，000多个，全部建成和部分建成投入生产的约有700个，其中有45个是属于苏联援助下的重大建设项目。在农业生产方面，公报说，1958年我国农业生产获得了高产丰收。粮食总产量达到7，500亿斤，比上年增长了一倍。棉花总产量达到6，638万担，比上年增长了一倍。其他主要农作物产量也比上年增长很多。1958年全国粮食平均每亩产量（按播种面积计算）为412斤，棉花平均每亩产量为77斤。按耕地面积计算，1958年全国已有许多县市提前实现了十二年农业发展纲要规定的粮食每亩年产量分别达到400斤、500斤、800斤的指标；许多产棉地区也提前达到了十二年农业发展纲要规定的每亩年产棉花60斤、80斤、100斤的要求。
    关于交通运输和邮电工作，公报说，1958年全国有五十五条新的铁路线先后施工，二十九条原有线路进行复线建设或改建，加上企业专用线，全年铁路铺轨里程共达3，564公里，比上年增长一倍多。全年新建公路（包括简易公路）15万公里，比上年增长七倍多。全年整治和新增的内河航道达1万公里。1958年全国邮电业务量比上年增长41％。
    公报最后的两部分是国内外商业和人民的物质生活和文化生活。公报说，1958年全国职工平均人数达到3，200多万人，比上年增加了约800万人，职工队伍空前扩大，旧社会遗留下来的失业现象已经消灭。同时，在人民公社化以后，由于家务劳动的社会化，全国约有几千万妇女劳动力，参加了社会劳动。随着生产建设的发展和劳动就业人数的增加，1958年我国人民的购买力有了进一步的发展，市场物价始终保持稳定。
    公报最后说，1958年我国社会主义建设各个战线在大跃进中所取得的伟大成就，是全国人民努力执行党的社会主义建设总路线和英勇劳动的结果；同时也是和以苏联为首的社会主义各国的援助分不开的。在1958年伟大成就的基础上，全国人民在中共中央和毛主席的领导下，正在努力争取1959年社会主义建设继续大跃进的新胜利。
