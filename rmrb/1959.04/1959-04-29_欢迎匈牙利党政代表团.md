    Welcome to the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation
    The Hungarian Party and Government Delegation, headed by Comrade Münnich Ferenc, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, has arrived in our country for a friendly visit at the invitation of our Party and Government, after visiting our fraternal neighboring countries, the Mongolian People's Republic and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. We extend a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to the representatives of the brotherly Hungarian Party and Government!
    China and Hungary are both close brothers in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. Our two countries have established an eternal and unbreakable brotherly friendship on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. In recent years, our two countries have supported each other and cooperated with each other in political, economic and cultural fields, and have encouraged each other. The mutual visits of party and government leaders, people's representatives, and economic and cultural delegations of our two countries have continuously strengthened the understanding and unity between the people of our two countries. Through mutual assistance and cooperation in economic and cultural fields, Hungary has provided us with various industrial enterprise equipment and agricultural machinery, and has sent experts to help our country carry out socialist construction, for which the Chinese people are deeply grateful. In recent years, the unity between our two parties has been established on a more solid and firm foundation. Both of our parties participated in the meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries held in Moscow in November 1957, and together with other fraternal parties of socialist countries, signed the Moscow Declaration, which has become the program of the current international communist movement. Under the glorious illumination of this declaration, the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the international communist movement centered on the CPSU are being consolidated day by day.
    In the fourteen years since liberation, the heroic Hungarian people have achieved brilliant victories in socialist construction. Especially since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion at the end of 1956, the Hungarian people, led by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, resolutely followed the socialist road, continued to carry out socialist construction victoriously, and achieved great achievements in all aspects. The political line and basic policies of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kádár have won the support and endorsement of the broad masses of the Hungarian working people. In the elections to the Hungarian National Assembly and local councils held last November, the candidates nominated by the Patriotic People's Front with the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party as its core won 99.6% of the votes, and the Hungarian people's regime was further consolidated. Hungary's economy is also booming. In 1958, Hungary's total industrial output value increased by 12% compared with 1957, exceeding the original plan by 4.7%. Thanks to the positive measures taken by the Hungarian Party and Government in consolidating and developing agricultural cooperatives, a high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture has emerged throughout Hungary this spring. In just three months, the area of cultivated land of cooperatives has more than doubled, and together with the area of cultivated land of state-owned farms, the socialist component of agriculture has accounted for 49% of the total area of cultivated land in Hungary. With the development of socialist economic construction, the material and cultural life of the Hungarian people is also constantly improving. The great achievements made by the Hungarian people in socialist construction have made the Chinese people and all friends of Hungary feel happy and encouraged.
    Today, the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is advancing rapidly towards the great goals of socialism and communism. At present, the Hungarian working people are responding to the call of the Socialist Workers' Party to strive to complete the main production targets stipulated in the Three-Year Plan within two years, that is, by the end of this year. Our people are also continuing to strive for a great leap forward in our country's socialist construction. All these will make important contributions to the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism.
    The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian people, with their glorious traditions, are unswervingly carrying out a resolute struggle to safeguard and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to oppose modern revisionism, and to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism. The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, making significant contributions to preventing imperialist aggression and war plots, safeguarding world peace and the cause of human progress. This Hungarian delegation visited the Mongolian People's Republic and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and will also visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea after visiting our country. Undoubtedly, this visit of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation to Asian brotherly countries will make new contributions to the cause of world peace and the unity and cooperation of socialist countries.
    During its visit to our country, the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation will hold friendly talks with our Party and Government leaders. We firmly believe that the visit of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation and the talks between the Party and Government leaders of China and Hungary will further strengthen the eternal and unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of the two countries and between the two parties. As the distinguished Hungarian guests arrive in our capital, we sincerely wish the brotherly friendship between the people of China and Hungary to last forever, and wish the people of China and Hungary continuous victories in the common cause of building socialism!

    欢迎匈牙利党政代表团
    以匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会政治局委员、匈牙利工农革命政府总理明尼赫·费伦茨同志为首的匈牙利党政代表团，应我国党和政府的邀请，在访问了我们的兄弟邻邦蒙古人民共和国和越南民主共和国之后，前来我国进行友好访问，今天到达北京。我们对兄弟般的匈牙利党和政府的代表们表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意！
    中匈两国都是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的亲密兄弟。我们两国在马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上，建立了永恒的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊。几年来，我们两国在政治、经济和文化等方面互相支持、彼此合作，共同鼓舞。我们两国党政领导人、人民代表以及经济和文化等代表团的互相访问，不断加强我们两国人民之间的了解和团结。通过经济和文化等方面的互助合作，匈牙利向我们提供各种工业企业设备和农业机器，并且派遣专家，帮助我国进行社会主义建设，我国人民对此深表感谢。几年来，我们两党之间的团结已经建立在更加巩固和坚实的基础上。我们两党都参加了1957年11月在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议，并同其他社会主义国家兄弟党一起签署了莫斯科会议宣言，这个宣言已成为当前国际共产主义运动的纲领。在这个宣言的光辉的照耀下，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和以苏共为中心的国际共产主义运动的团结日益巩固。
    在解放后的十四年中，英雄的匈牙利人民在社会主义建设方面取得了光辉的胜利。特别是自从1956年底反革命叛乱平息以后，匈牙利人民在匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，坚决地走社会主义的道路，继续胜利地进行社会主义建设，在各方面都取得了很大的成就。以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利社会主义工人党的政治路线和基本政策取得了匈牙利广大劳动人民的支持和拥护。在去年11月举行的匈牙利国民议会和地方议会的选举中，以匈牙利社会主义工人党为核心的爱国人民阵线提出的候选人获得了99.6％的选票，匈牙利人民政权更加巩固了。匈牙利的经济也蓬勃发展。1958年匈牙利工业总产值比1957年增长了12％，超过原计划4.7％。由于匈牙利党和政府在巩固和发展农业合作社方面采取了积极的措施，今年春天匈牙利全国出现了农业社会主义改造的高潮。在短短的三个月内，合作社的耕地面积就增加了一倍左右，同国营农场的耕地面积合在一起，社会主义成分的农业已经占到匈牙利全国耕地面积的49％。随着社会主义经济建设的发展，匈牙利人民的物质和文化生活也在不断提高。匈牙利人民在社会主义建设中取得的重大成就，使中国人民以及匈牙利所有的朋友都感到欢欣鼓舞。
    今天，以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营正以一日千里的速度向社会主义和共产主义的伟大目标飞速前进。目前匈牙利劳动人民正在响应社会主义工人党的号召，争取在两年内即在今年年底完成三年计划所规定的主要生产指标。我国人民也正在继续争取我国社会主义建设的大跃进。所有这些，都将在社会主义同资本主义的和平经济竞赛中作出重要的贡献。
    具有光荣传统的匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利人民，坚定不移地为维护和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，为反对现代修正主义、保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性而进行坚决的斗争。匈牙利工农革命政府坚持不渝地奉行着和平外交政策，对制止帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋、维护世界和平和人类进步事业作出重大的贡献。这次匈牙利代表团访问了蒙古人民共和国和越南民主共和国，在访问我国之后还要去朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行访问。无疑地，这次匈牙利党政代表团对亚洲兄弟国家的访问将对世界和平事业和社会主义国家团结合作作出新的贡献。
    匈牙利党政代表团在访问我国期间，将同我国党政领导人进行友好的会谈。我们深信，匈牙利党政代表团的访问和中匈两国党政领导人的会谈，一定会进一步加强两国人民之间和两党之间的永恒的、牢不可破的友谊和团结。当匈牙利贵宾们到达我们首都的时候，我们衷心地祝中匈两国人民的兄弟友谊万古长青，祝中匈两国人民在建设社会主义的共同事业中节节胜利！
