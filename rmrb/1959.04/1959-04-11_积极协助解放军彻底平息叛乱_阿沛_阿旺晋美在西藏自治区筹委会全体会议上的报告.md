Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 10th. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Deputy Director and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, delivered a report at the Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region on the 8th. The full text is as follows:

Acting Chairman, Panchen Erdeni, Deputy Director Zhang Guohua, fellow committee members, comrades:

The convocation of this Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region here today marks a new page in Tibetan history. I will address three issues at this meeting:

First, although the Tibetan local government had expressed its intention to thoroughly implement the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, in reality, the Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata betrayed the wishes and interests of the Tibetan people, colluded with imperialism, and for a long time plotted to tear up the agreement. They consistently usurped the name of the people, organized reactionary groups, and conspired to carry out counter-revolutionary activities to betray the motherland and the people. Especially since May and June 1958, they secretly gathered and armed the most reactionary serf owners who had fled from neighboring provinces, and launched armed rebellions in areas such as Shannan. Regarding this crime of betraying the motherland and opposing the people, the Central Government, in the spirit of national unity, repeatedly instructed the Tibetan local government to punish the ringleaders who were carrying out rebellious activities in the Tibetan region, to quell the rebellion, and to maintain social order. However, the Tibetan local government feigned compliance while acting contrary, pretending to respect the Central Government, but in reality continued to support and collude with reactionary groups, expanding their treasonous activities. Especially recently, they openly gathered bandits and conspired to instigate treasonous activities. However, due to the correct policies of the Central Government, they had no excuse. They then took advantage of the Dalai Lama's expression a month ago of his willingness to go to the military region to see a performance, and his own decision to go to the military auditorium on March 10th to see a performance. They shamelessly fabricated rumors out of thin air, saying that the military region was going to abduct the Dalai Lama, in order to deceive the people, openly tearing up the Seventeen-Article Agreement, and launching serious and sinful activities to betray the motherland and the people. At the gate of Norbulingka, they murdered the patriotic personage, Tselay Namgyal, a member of the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and wounded Sangpo Tenzin Dhondup, Deputy Commander of the Tibet Military Region and Standing Committee member of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. This serious behavior is truly intolerable by national law. However, the Central Government was still magnanimous, and with great patience, hoped that the Tibetan local government would correct its past mistakes, take responsibility, thoroughly quell the rebellion, and maintain social order. Not only that, but General Tan Guansan, the Acting Representative of the Central People's Government, wrote to the Dalai Lama three times. These letters have already been published in full, and everyone has seen them. In his reply, the Dalai Lama stated that he was trying everything possible to deal with the illegal incidents of the reactionary faction abducting him and stationing troops in Norbulingka with weapons. The Central Government's Acting Representative also welcomed this.

After this, the reactionary group abducted the Dalai Lama, and on the night of March 19th, launched an armed attack on the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa. Therefore, the hope for a peaceful resolution, which the Central Government had consistently adhered to, was shattered. The heroic People's Liberation Army was ordered to suppress the treasonous group that had committed heinous crimes. After two days of battle, they eliminated the reactionary armed forces in Lhasa and its suburbs, thereby further consolidating the unity of the motherland, strengthening national unity, and bringing new life to the Tibetan people.

Second, as everyone knows, in the nearly eight years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the People's Liberation Army and cadres stationed in Tibet have observed and implemented the Party's ethnic policies and the Seventeen-Article Agreement. They have maintained strict discipline, strengthened the unity between the peoples of all ethnic groups and the internal unity of the Tibetan people. At the same time, they have promoted the development and improvement of the Tibetan people's political, economic, and cultural lives, and have strived to carry out various construction projects. They have implemented and continue to implement the policies of freedom of religious belief, respect for customs and habits, and protection of Lama temples. This is well known to the Tibetan monks and laypeople. The Central Government has been very concerned about the Dalai Lama. His past status and powers have not been changed. He was also elected as Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, becoming a national leader; and he was also appointed as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, giving him great honor in all aspects. The agreement stipulated that the powers of the Tibetan local government would not be changed, and that monks and lay officials would continue to serve as usual. The agreement also stipulated the reorganization of the Tibetan army, and that the Tibetan serf system would also be reformed in a peaceful and consultative manner according to the wishes of the people, so that the Tibetan people could embark on the path of a happy life, and that the upper strata and various temples could also receive certain benefits. However, the Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata wanted to oppress the Tibetan people for a long time and resist the correct policies of the Central Government. In order to gradually eliminate these erroneous dreams, the Central Government adopted a policy of patient persuasion and education, and decided not to carry out reforms during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and temporarily not to reorganize the Tibetan army. Tibetan affairs were all resolved patiently by peaceful means. The Party's policies were patiently explained, and education and unity were strengthened in all aspects. This is what the Tibetan monks and laypeople have all seen.

However, the Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata, colluding with imperialism and bandits, betrayed the motherland, betrayed the people, undermined the unity of the motherland, and attempted to return the Tibetan people to a dark and impoverished state, subject to the enslavement of imperialism. All these crimes are intolerable to the Tibetan monks, laypeople, and patriotic progressive people.

Third, the State Council issued an order on March 28th, dissolving the Tibetan local government from that day on, and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region would exercise the powers of the Tibetan local government. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will lead the Tibetan monks and laypeople, unite and work together, assist the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly quelling the rebellion, consolidating national defense, safeguarding the interests of the people of all ethnic groups, restoring social order, and striving to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet. These decisions not only fully conform to the actual situation in Tibet, but also fully conform to the interests and wishes of the Tibetan monks and laypeople.

Today, under the chairmanship of Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, we are holding a plenary session to conscientiously discuss the implementation of the State Council's order and will pass five resolutions. Under the care and leadership of Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni and Deputy Directors Zhang Guohua and Phagpalha Geleg Namgyal, I will do my utmost to assist in carrying out various tasks. I believe that with the united efforts of all committee members, directors, and deputy directors, and cadres at all levels, we will certainly be able to thoroughly implement the State Council's order. There is no doubt about this. Thoroughly quelling the rebellion in the Tibetan region is our main task at present. We must contribute all our strength to lead and organize all Tibetan monks and laypeople to actively assist the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion. We must treat the rebellious elements differently: the chief culprits must be punished; officials and masses who have joined reactionary groups because they are unclear about their future will be given lenient treatment as long as they admit their mistakes and surrender; those who have been deceived and coerced will not be punished after handing over their weapons.

Administrative personnel at all levels of the original local government should hand over weapons, public property, documents undamaged, and support the orders of the military control committees at all levels during the period of quelling the rebellion. The Tibetan people should enhance their patriotic ideology, faithfully and actively support the People's Liberation Army, must not collude with reactionary elements, actively expose hidden counter-revolutionaries, and must not listen to rumors.

In conclusion, let us shout:

Long live the happiness and new life of all the Tibetan people!

Long live our beloved and great motherland!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao, the beloved and great leader of the people of all ethnic groups!

May Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni and Deputy Director Zhang Guohua, and all committee members and comrades enjoy good health.

　　积极协助解放军彻底平息叛乱
    阿沛·阿旺晋美在西藏自治区筹委会全体会议上的报告
    新华社拉萨10日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美8日在西藏自治区筹备委员会全体委员会议上的报告，全文如下：
    代理主任委员班禅大师、张国华副主任、各位委员、同志们：
    今天在这里召开西藏自治区筹备委员会全体委员会议，这是西藏历史上的新的一页。我在这个会上谈三个问题：
    第一，西藏地方政府虽然曾经表示要彻底执行关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，但是实际上西藏地方政府和上层反动集团却背弃西藏人民的愿望和利益，勾结帝国主义，长期蓄谋撕毁协议。他们一贯盗用人民的名义，组织反动团体，阴谋进行背叛祖国、背叛人民的反动活动，特别是在1958年5、6月以来，他们暗中纠集和武装了从邻省逃出来的最反动的农奴主，在山南等地区发动了武装叛乱。对于这种背叛祖国、反对人民的罪行，中央本着民族团结的精神，多次责成西藏地方政府惩办那些在西藏地区进行叛乱活动的首恶分子，平息叛乱，维护社会治安。而西藏地方政府却阳奉阴违，假装尊重中央，实际上却继续支持和勾结反动集团，扩大叛国活动。尤其是最近公开纠集叛匪，阴谋策动叛国活动。但是由于中央的正确的方针使他们无所借口，乃利用达赖喇嘛本人在一个月前表示愿去军区看戏，并自己决定在3月10日到军区礼堂看戏的这一机会，无中生有地无耻造谣说，军区要把达赖喇嘛劫走，用来欺骗人民，公开撕毁了十七条协议，发动了背叛祖国、背叛人民的严重的罪恶活动，在罗布林卡门口杀害了爱国人士、西藏自治区筹备委员会宗教事务委员会委员索朗降措，打伤了西藏军区副司令员、西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员桑颇·才旺仁增。这种严重的行为，实为国法难容，但是中央仍宽大为怀，以极大的耐心，希望西藏地方政府改正过去的错误，负起责任，彻底平息叛乱、维护社会秩序。不仅如此，中央人民政府的代理代表谭冠三将军，曾三次写信给达赖喇嘛。这些信件，已经原文公布，大家都已看到。达赖喇嘛在其回信中表示，对反动派劫持他和以武装进驻罗布林卡的非法事件，正想尽一切办法，进行处理，对此中央代理代表，也表示欢迎。
    此后，反动集团劫走了达赖喇嘛，并于3月19日夜间，对驻拉萨的人民解放军发动了武装进攻，因此，中央一贯坚持的和平解决的希望破灭了，英勇的人民解放军奉命讨伐罪恶滔天的叛国集团，经过两天的战斗，即消灭了拉萨市区和郊区的反动武装，从而进一步巩固了祖国的统一，加强了民族团结，使西藏人民得到了新生。
    第二，正如大家所知，西藏和平解放后近八年来，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，驻藏人民解放军和干部，遵守和执行了党的民族政策和十七条协议，纪律严明，加强了各民族人民之间的团结和藏族内部的团结，同时，使西藏人民的政治、经济、文化和人民生活得到发展和提高，并努力进行了各项建设工作，执行了和继续执行着宗教信仰自由、尊重风俗习惯、保护喇嘛寺庙的政策，这是西藏僧俗人民所熟知的。中央对达赖喇嘛是十分关怀的，过去的地位和职权未予变动，还选为全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长，成为国家领导人员；而且又委任为西藏自治区筹备委员会的主任委员，从各方面都给了极大的光荣。在协议中规定，西藏地方政府的职权不予变更，僧俗官员照常供职。协议还规定改编藏军，对于西藏的农奴制社会制度也根据人民的意愿，以和平协商的方式加以改革，使西藏人民走上幸福生活的道路，使上层人士、各寺庙也得到一定的好处。但是，西藏地方政府和上层反动集团想长期压迫西藏人民，抗拒中央的正确政策。中央为了逐步消除这些错误的梦想，采取耐心说服教育和等待的方针，决定在第二个五年计划期间不进行改革，暂时不改编藏军。西藏的事务，都用和平的方法，耐心地加以解决。并耐心地解释党的政策，从各方面进行教育和加强团结，这是西藏僧俗人民都看到了的。
    但是西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和叛匪，背叛祖国，背叛人民，破坏祖国统一，企图使西藏人民重新回到黑暗贫困的境地，受帝国主义的奴役，这一切罪行是西藏僧俗人民和爱国进步人士所不能容忍的。
    第三，这次国务院于3月28日发布命令，从那天起解散了西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使西藏地方政府的职权。西藏自治区筹备委员会领导西藏僧俗人民，团结一致共同努力，协助人民解放军彻底平息叛乱，巩固国防，维护各民族人民的利益，恢复社会秩序，为建设民主的、社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。这些决定不仅完全符合西藏的实际情况，也完全符合西藏僧俗人民的利益和愿望。
    今天，在西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅大师的主持下，召开全体委员会议，认真讨论执行国务院的命令，将要通过五项决议。我一定在代理主任委员班禅大师、副主任委员张国华、帕巴拉·卓列朗杰的关怀和领导下，竭力协助作好各项工作。我相信在各位委员、主任、正副处长等各级干部的团结一致的努力下，一定可以彻底实现国务院的命令，这是毫无疑问的。彻底平息西藏地区叛乱是我们当前的主要任务，我们一定要贡献出一切力量，领导和组织西藏全体僧俗人民积极协助人民解放军平息叛乱，对叛乱分子要实行区别对待：首恶必办；凡不清楚自己前途而参加反动集团的官员和群众只要能承认自己的错误而来投诚者，给予宽大处理；对受欺骗和被裹胁者，在交出武器后不给处分。
    原地方政府的各级行政人员，在平息叛乱期间应无损地交出武器、公共财物、文件，和拥护各级军事管制委员会的命令。西藏人民应提高爱国主义思想，忠实地、积极地支援人民解放军，不得与反动分子勾结，积极揭露隐藏的反革命分子，不得听信谣言。
    最后高呼：
    全西藏人民的幸福和新生万岁！
    我们热爱的伟大祖国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    各族人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    代理主任委员班禅大师和张国华副主任委员及各位委员、全体同志身体健康。
