Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 21st. A grand rally was held today by people from all walks of life in Warsaw at the National Philharmonic Hall to celebrate the 14th anniversary of the signing of the Polish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation. More than 1,000 people attended the celebration.

Polish party and government leaders Gomulka, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, Ochab, and others, as well as Soviet Ambassador to Poland, Abrasimov, attended the celebration.

The celebration was opened by Zawadzki, Chairman of the Presidium of the All-Poland Committee of the National Unity Front.

Ochab, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a report at the meeting on the 14th anniversary of the signing of the Polish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation. Ochab said that the Polish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation has great significance and vitality. The treaty is solid not only because Poland and the Soviet Union share common national and state interests, but also because both countries consistently adhere to Marxist-Leninist ideology. He pointed out that the attempts by imperialist schemers to weaken relations between Poland and the Soviet Union have failed. The friendly relations between Poland and the Soviet Union have not weakened, but have been strengthened and developed on the basis of the Leninist principles followed by the policies of the two brotherly countries.

Ochab said that one of the important sources of the strength and solidity of the Polish-Soviet Treaty is that it is not a temporary diplomatic agreement concluded to adapt to the situation. It was signed in blood by Polish and Soviet soldiers who fought side by side against the common enemy of all progressive mankind—fascism, and shed their blood together in the heroic struggle for the freedom and vital interests of the Polish and Soviet people.

Ochab said that the Polish-Soviet Treaty is an important guarantee against the resurgence of West German aggressive forces, and against German imperialists pushing the world towards war again. Speaking about the Polish western border on the Oder-Neisse line, he said, "We are pleased to point out that our loyal friend and ally, the Soviet Union, has always defended the just decisions made at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences to return the western territories, which have historically belonged to Poland, to Poland."

Ochab pointed out that the Polish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation guarantees the development of cooperation and mutual assistance between the two countries. This is of great significance to the development of Poland's economy and productive forces. Ochab said that many factories and enterprises in Poland were built with the direct help of the Soviet Union, and without the Soviet Union's help, Poland would not have developed as quickly as it has today.

Ochab said that the Polish people fully support the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and to turn West Berlin into a free city. He also said that the government of the German Democratic Republic can at any time count on Poland's help in the struggle against imperialism and the forces of war.

Ochab then spoke about the significance of the Polish-Soviet Treaty for the entire socialist camp and for easing international tensions.

Ochab concluded by saying that socialism has now gained a decisive advantage over capitalism. Poland is part of the rapidly developing great socialist camp. We will always unswervingly safeguard the unity of the socialist camp. This unity has been and is the source of our achievements and the guarantee of our development.

Ochab also said that whether in good times or difficult times, the Polish workers, soldiers, and people will always be with the Soviet workers, soldiers, and people.

Ambassador Abrasimov then spoke. He pointed out that for fourteen years, the Soviet-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation has demonstrated its vitality. He said that Soviet-Polish relations have never been as close as they are now.

    华沙集会庆祝波苏条约签订十四周年
    奥哈布指出波苏条约是防止西德侵略的重要保证
    新华社华沙21日电　华沙各界人民今天在国家音乐厅举行盛大集会，庆祝波苏友好互助和战后合作条约签订十四周年。参加庆祝会的有一千多人。
    波兰党政领导人哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹、奥哈布等以及苏联驻波兰大使阿布拉西莫夫参加了庆祝会。
    庆祝大会由波兰全国阵线全波委员会主席团主席萨瓦茨基主持开幕。
    波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员奥哈布在会上作了关于波苏友好互助和战后合作条约签订十四周年的报告。奥哈布说，波苏友好互助和战后合作条约具有重大的意义和生命力。这个条约之所以巩固，不仅由于波苏两国有着共同的民族利益和国家利益，而且由于两国一致遵循马克思列宁主义思想。他指出，帝国主义谋士们企图削弱波苏两国关系的打算落空了。波苏的友好关系不仅没有削弱，反而在两个兄弟国家的政策所遵循的列宁主义原则的基础上日益加强和不断发展了。
    奥哈布说，波苏条约之所以有力量、之所以巩固，其重要源泉之一在于这个条约不是为适应局势而缔结的暂时的外交协定，它是由波苏两国战士用鲜血签订的，他们在同整个进步人类的死敌——法西斯主义搏斗的战场上，在争取波苏两国人民的自由和切身利益的英勇斗争中共同流下了鲜血。
    奥哈布说，波苏条约是防止西德侵略势力再起，不准德国帝国主义分子再把世界推向战争的一个重要保证。他在谈到波兰西部奥得—尼斯国界时说，我们很高兴地指出，我们忠实的朋友和盟国苏联一直在卫护雅尔塔和波茨坦会议作出的关于把历来属于波兰的西部国土归还给波兰的公正决定。
    奥哈布指出，波苏友好互助和战后合作条约保证了两国之间的合作和互助关系的发展。这一点对波兰经济和生产力的发展有着重要的意义。奥哈布说，波兰的很多工厂和企业都是在苏联的直接帮助下建设的，如果没有苏联的帮助，波兰就不会有像今天这样快的发展速度。
    奥哈布说，波兰人民完全支持苏联关于缔结对德和约和把西柏林变成自由城市的建议。他还说，在同帝国主义和战争势力进行的斗争中，德意志民主共和国政府任何时候都可以得到波兰的帮助。
    奥哈布接着谈到了波苏条约对整个社会主义阵营、对缓和国际局势的意义。
    奥哈布最后说，现在社会主义已经对资本主义占决定性优势。波兰是迅速发展中的伟大的社会主义阵营的一部分。我们将始终不渝地维护社会主义阵营的团结。这种团结过去和现在都是我们取得成就的源泉，是我们发展的保证。
    奥哈布还说，无论在顺利的时刻或者困难的时刻，波兰的工人、士兵、人民将永远和苏联的工人、士兵、人民在一起。
    接着阿布拉西莫夫大使讲了话。他指出，十四年来，苏波友好互助和战后合作条约显示了它的生命力。他说，苏波关系从来都没有像现在这样密切。
