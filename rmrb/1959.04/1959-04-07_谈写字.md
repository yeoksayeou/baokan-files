    Talking About Writing Characters
  　Liu Quan
    Characters should be written so that people can understand them at a glance, or at least be able to recognize what they are with a little effort. It is not good if they are written too hastily or if characters are invented arbitrarily, making them incomprehensible no matter how many times you look at them or how much you think about them.
    I am a typesetter, and I often come across bizarre characters that are so carelessly written that no matter how you try to identify them, you can't. For the sake of my work, I have to patiently try to figure them out, but I still can't get to the bottom of it. Some people also use a large number of self-created "simplified characters" that do not yet have a mass base. "?", if it weren't in a sentence, I don't think I would ever read it as "蜜" (honey); simplifying "葡萄" (grape) to "??" is probably not appropriate at the moment either. These inexplicable strange characters waste a lot of unnecessary energy.
    Why does this happen? Probably because people are too busy with work and, in order to save time, they pick up their pen and dash things off.
    It is originally a good thing to cherish your time in order to do more work. However, it is not right if you save your own writing time but increase the reading time of the other person.
    I remember Mr. Lu Xun once criticized such people, saying that they write carelessly to save time, but others cannot understand it even after reading it three or five times, which is not good. I think this pertinent criticism should give comrades who are in the habit of writing carelessly and strangely something to think about.

    谈写字
  　刘权
    字，要写得使人一看就懂得，至少也应使人稍加辨认就知道它是什么字，如果写得过于潦草或是滥行造字，使人百看不懂，百思不解，这就不好了。
    我是一个排字工人，我经常碰到一些潦草得出奇的怪字，任凭你怎样辨认，也认它不出。为了工作，只得耐心辨认，结果还是弄不出个所以然。也有些人把还没有群众基础、自己杜撰的一些“简化字”大量使用起来。“?”，如果不是在一个句子里，我想无论如何也不会读成“蜜”字；把“葡萄”简化为“??”目前恐怕也不太合适。这些莫明其妙的怪字不知道使人耗费了多少无谓的精力。
    为什么会出现这种情况呢？恐怕是因为工作太忙，为抓紧时间计，于是提起笔来，一扫而过所造成的吧。
    珍惜自己的时间，以便更多的工作，这种精神原本是好的。但是由于节省了自己写的时间，却增加了对方读的时间，这就是不应该的了。
    我记得鲁迅先生曾批评过这种人，说他们为了节省时间就马马虎虎地写完了事，而别人三遍五遍的也看不懂，这是不好的。我认为这个中肯的批评应该引起惯写潦草怪字的同志们的深思。
