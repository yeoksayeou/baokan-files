Comrades Deputies:

On behalf of the State Council, I submit to the Congress the report on the draft national economic plan for 1959 for your deliberation.

In 1958, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and following the direction indicated by the general line of socialist construction, the people of all ethnic groups in our country, after a year of hard work, achieved unprecedented great victories on all fronts of the national economy, building on the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan. As you have already seen from the communique on the development of the national economy in 1958, in that year, whether it was in industrial and agricultural production and basic construction, or in transportation and commerce, or in cultural education, scientific research, and health undertakings, all achieved leaping development. In the context of the great leap forward in agriculture and the rapid increase in the socialist consciousness of the peasant masses, the rural areas across the country realized the communization of the people. Thus, a situation of national and comprehensive great leap forward emerged in our country.

Premier Zhou's report has already clearly explained the significance and reasons for the great leap forward in 1958, and I will not repeat them here.

Based on the development of the situation in 1958, the Central Committee of the CPC, at its Sixth Plenary Session held in November of that year, summarized the experience of the great leap forward in the national economy, discussed the main tasks and policies for developing the national economy in 1959, and proposed the four targets of 18 million tons of steel output, 380 million tons of coal output, 1,050 billion jin of grain output, and 100 million dan of cotton output. These are the main bases for us to compile the draft plan for 1959. This draft plan has been discussed and approved successively by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC and the plenary meeting of the State Council earlier this month and in the middle of this month. Its main contents are as follows:

The planned total industrial and agricultural output value is 287 billion yuan, an increase of 40 percent or 82 billion yuan compared to the 205 billion yuan in 1958.

In the total industrial and agricultural output value, the planned output value of industry and handicrafts is 165 billion yuan, an increase of 41 percent compared to the 117 billion yuan in 1958; the planned total agricultural output value is 122 billion yuan, an increase of 39 percent compared to the 88 billion yuan in 1958. The planned rate of development of industry and agriculture reflects the Party's policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture.

In terms of industrial production: the industrial production plan for 1959 first focuses on the development of raw materials, materials industry, and fuel and power industry. Because only with more raw materials, especially steel, can more machines be manufactured; and only with more raw materials, fuel, power, and machines can the various industrial sectors and even the various sectors of the national economy achieve faster development. Consistent with the targets of 18 million tons of steel and 380 million tons of coal, the plan stipulates that pig iron production will increase from 13.69 million tons in 1958 to 23 million tons, power generation will increase from 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours in 1958 to 40 billion kilowatt-hours, and cement production will increase from 9.3 million tons in 1958 to 12.5 million tons. The output of other important raw materials and fuels, such as crude oil, timber, sulfuric acid, caustic soda, and soda ash, will also increase significantly. The increased output of these products in 1959 will be higher than the increased output in 1958. For example, compared to 1957, pig iron production increased by 7.75 million tons, power generation increased by 8.2 billion kilowatt-hours, and cement production increased by 2.44 million tons in 1958; while compared to 1958, pig iron production will increase by 9.31 million tons, power generation will increase by 12.5 billion kilowatt-hours, and cement production will increase by 3.2 million tons in 1959. It should be noted that this year's planned output of pig iron and steel includes a small portion of native iron and native steel.

The production plan for the machinery manufacturing industry in 1959 is arranged according to the principle of first ensuring the needs of the rapid development of the raw materials, materials industry, and fuel and power industry, ensuring the needs of the development of transportation and agriculture, and appropriately taking care of the needs of the development of light industry. In 1959, the output of mining equipment, coal washing equipment, coking equipment, steel rolling equipment, and power generation equipment will all increase several times over. For example, the output of power generation equipment will increase from 800,000 kilowatts in 1958 to 2.8 million to 3 million kilowatts, an increase of 250 percent to 275 percent. The output of cement equipment, chemical equipment, and oil refining equipment will also increase considerably. In order to ensure the needs of the development of the transportation industry, the plan stipulates that the output of locomotives will increase from 350 units in 1958 to 555 units, the output of freight cars will increase from 11,000 units in 1958 to 27,000 to 28,500 units, and the output of automobiles and civilian ships will also increase considerably. In order to support the development of agriculture, in addition to stipulating that the output of chemical fertilizers will increase from 811,000 tons in 1958 to 1.3 million to 1.5 million tons, the machinery manufacturing industry will provide 2 million horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery, 3,000 tractors, 1,100 grain combine harvesters, and 3,000 motorized threshers. In order to meet the requirements of light industry development, the 1959 plan calls for the production of 2.5 million spindles of cotton spinning machines, as well as the necessary paper-making equipment and sugar-making equipment. The planned output of metal cutting machine tools, which are needed by the machinery manufacturing industry itself, is 70,000 to 75,000 units (excluding simple machine tools), an increase of 40 to 50 percent compared to 50,000 units in 1958.

Due to the great leap forward in agriculture and heavy industry, it is possible and necessary to develop light industry faster in 1959. The plan stipulates that cotton yarn production will increase from 6.1 million pieces in 1958 to 8.5 million pieces, cotton cloth production will increase from 5.7 billion meters in 1958 to 7.2 billion meters, paper production will increase from 1.63 million tons in 1958 to 2.2 million tons, edible vegetable oil production will increase from 1.25 million tons in 1958 to 1.8 million tons, sugar production will increase from 900,000 tons in 1958 to 1.5 million tons, and crude salt production will increase from 10.4 million tons in 1958 to 13 million tons. These products will increase by 25 to 67 percent compared to 1958.

According to the above arrangements, the output value of the means of production industry in 1959 will reach 98 billion yuan, an increase of 46 percent compared to the 67 billion yuan in 1958; the output value of the means of subsistence industry will reach 67 billion yuan, an increase of 34 percent compared to the 50 billion yuan in 1958. It can be seen that the industrial production plan for 1959 implements the policy of simultaneously promoting heavy industry and light industry, implements the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, especially the development of the raw materials industry, and taking steel as the key and achieving a comprehensive leap forward.

In terms of agricultural production: the task of developing agriculture in 1959 is to strive with the greatest effort to leap forward grain production to 1,050 billion jin, cotton production to 100 million dan, to realize the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program regarding grain and cotton production increases ahead of schedule, and to achieve universal development of various cash crops and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

According to the possibility of increasing production and the needs of light industry development, the plan stipulates that the output of jute and ambary hemp should reach 10 million dan, an increase of 54 percent compared to 6.5 million dan in 1958; the output of sugarcane should reach 400 million dan, an increase of 48 percent compared to 270.5 million dan in 1958; the output of sugar beets should reach 110 million dan, an increase of 90 percent compared to 58 million dan in 1958; the output of soybeans should reach 30 billion jin, an increase of 20 percent compared to 25 billion jin in 1958; the output of peanuts should reach 120 million dan, an increase of 50 percent compared to 80 million dan in 1958; and the output of rapeseed should reach 32 million dan, an increase of 45 percent compared to 22 million dan in 1958.

The main way to increase the production of grain, cotton, and other crops is to increase the yield per unit area. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain a certain planting area and to expand the cultivated land of state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms in a planned way. The planned planting area for the whole country in 1959 is 2.1 billion mu, of which the planting area for grain is 1.6 billion mu and the planting area for cotton is 100 million mu. The plan also stipulates the expansion of the irrigated area by 100 million mu.

In order to increase the livestock power in agriculture, the plan stipulates that the total number of various large livestock raised should reach 90 million heads, an increase of 6 percent compared to 85.06 million heads in 1958. In order to increase the supply of non-staple food and increase fertilizer, the plan requires that the number of pigs raised should reach 280 million heads, an increase of 56 percent compared to 180 million heads in 1958; and the number of sheep raised should reach 120 million heads, an increase of 10 percent compared to 108.86 million heads in 1958. In addition, it is required to expand the planting area of vegetables and actively develop aquaculture; near cities and industrial and mining areas, the production bases of non-staple food should be established and expanded.

On the basis of vigorously increasing the production of grain and cotton, diversified operations of agriculture should be implemented to develop commodity production of the people's communes.

In terms of basic construction: the total amount of state investment in basic construction in 1959 is planned to be 27 billion yuan, an increase of 26 percent compared to 21.4 billion yuan in 1958. In the total investment, the industrial sector accounts for 17.74 billion yuan, the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy sectors account for 1.92 billion yuan, the transportation and postal and telecommunications sectors account for 5.55 billion yuan, the commerce, grain, and material reserve sectors account for 300 million yuan, the cultural, educational, and health sectors account for 650 million yuan, urban construction accounts for 480 million yuan, and other accounts for 360 million yuan. In 1959, basic construction investment is concentrated more on the industrial and transportation sectors. On the one hand, it is to ensure the needs of key construction; on the other hand, it is because the people's communes will have more investment in agricultural basic construction, and the state will also allocate another 1 billion yuan from the budget to help the people's communes develop production, most of which will also be used for agricultural basic construction. In the total amount of investment in the industrial sector, the investment in the metallurgical, power, coal, petroleum, chemical, timber, and building materials industries is 12.49 billion yuan, accounting for 70 percent. This is to enable the production capacity of the raw materials and fuel industries to have a greater increase in the near future.

Of the total investment in basic construction in 1959, 15.47 billion yuan is allocated to enterprises and units directly under the central departments, and 11.53 billion yuan is allocated to enterprises and units under the jurisdiction of local governments. This year, the proportion of basic construction investment allocated to local governments accounts for 42.7 percent of the total investment, which is a significant increase compared to previous years.

The plan stipulates that in 1959 there are 1,092 construction projects above the designated limit under construction, of which: 693 are heavy industry construction projects, 161 are light industry construction projects, 28 are water conservancy construction projects, 186 are transportation and postal and telecommunications construction projects, 9 are commercial construction projects, and 15 are cultural and educational construction projects. Of the above-mentioned heavy industry and light industry construction projects, 670 are planned to be completed in whole or in part this year and put into production.

The plan stipulates that the railways to be built in 1959, including new trunk lines, branch lines, enterprise dedicated lines and double tracks, total 5,500 kilometers. Because the increased freight volume in 1959 is mainly concentrated on existing railways, the construction of railways will first strengthen the original lines.

In terms of transportation: In order to ensure the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and basic construction, the planned railway freight volume for 1959 is 520 million tons, an increase of 36 percent compared to 380 million tons in 1958; the planned freight volume of enterprises directly under the Ministry of Communications is 35 million tons, an increase of 25 percent compared to 28 million tons in 1958. In addition, various localities have separately stipulated the indicators for developing highway and waterway transportation.

In terms of commerce: The planned total retail sales of social commodities in 1959 is 65 billion yuan, an increase of 19 percent compared to 54.8 billion yuan in 1958. The supply of grain, meat, edible vegetable oil, aquatic products, salt, cotton cloth, knitwear, woolens, cigarettes, and other daily necessities through commercial organizations will all increase compared to 1958.

In terms of cultural and educational undertakings: The plan stipulates that in 1959, colleges and universities will enroll 250,000 students, and the number of students in school will reach 830,000, an increase of 25.8 percent compared to 1958; secondary vocational schools will enroll 700,000 students, and the number of students in school will reach 1.82 million, an increase of 23.8 percent compared to 1958; senior high schools will enroll 650,000 students, and the number of students in school will reach 1.52 million, an increase of 28.8 percent compared to 1958. The work of junior high school education, primary school education, spare-time education, and eliminating illiteracy in 1959 will be separately stipulated with appropriate indicators by various localities according to the actual conditions of the local area. The cultural undertakings, scientific research undertakings, health undertakings, and sports undertakings in 1959 will be further developed along with the development of production.

It can be seen from the above that the national economic plan for 1959 is a plan for a continued great leap forward.

It is necessary to realize such a continued great leap forward plan. We have achieved a great leap forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, and the output of steel, coal, grain, and cotton has more than doubled compared to 1957, but the level of economic development that has been achieved is still very low for a large country with a population of more than 600 million. According to the population average in 1958, each person only had more than 30 jin of steel, nearly 900 jin of coal, more than 1,200 jin of grain, and 11 jin of cotton. Obviously, this is still far from meeting the needs of national construction and people's lives. This is also the basic reason why the supply of these products and many other products still appears tight despite the large increase in output. Precisely because of this, as the Resolution of the Central Committee of the CPC on Certain Questions Concerning the People's Communes stated, we must work hard for three years, plus make further efforts for several years, to make a great change in the economic face of the country.

It is also possible to realize such a continued great leap forward plan through the hard work of the people of the whole country.

First of all, the great leap forward in industrial production in 1958 has provided favorable material and technical conditions for the continued leap forward in 1959. The production volume of the means of production industry in 1958 increased by 103 percent compared to 1957; the output of important means of production, such as steel, pig iron, coal, power generation equipment, locomotives, automobiles, power machinery, grain combine harvesters, etc., has more than doubled compared to 1957. In 1958, about 700 industrial and mining construction units above the designated limit across the country were completed in whole or in part and put into production; in addition, a large number of industrial and mining construction units below the designated limit were completed and put into production. Large blast furnaces with a volume of 1,513 cubic meters, rolling mills for medium and heavy steel plates with a plate width of 2,300 mm, thermal power generation equipment with a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts, and forging hydraulic presses with a pressure of 2,500 tons, which our country could not produce in the past, were all successfully trial-produced in 1958. In terms of basic construction in agriculture, we increased the irrigated area by 480 million mu in 1958. In terms of railway transportation, we built 3,564 kilometers of railways; the railway freight volume also increased from more than 270 million tons in 1957 to 380 million tons. These major achievements will all have a huge impact on the continued leap forward of the national economy this year.

Secondly, due to the realization of the communization of the people in the rural areas, agricultural productivity has been further liberated. The vast number of rural women have reduced the burden of housework and happily participated in agricultural production. At the same time, millions of laborers have transferred from the agricultural front to the industrial front. This has greatly strengthened the production force of industry and agriculture. After a period of training, the labor proficiency of this part of the fresh force on the production front will soon be improved.

Thirdly, on various fronts such as industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce, a large amount of technical and organizational experience has been accumulated in the great leap forward of 1958. The broad masses of working people have learned effective ways to carry out production and construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and have launched a mass movement to continuously improve work and boldly invent and create. Many measures that were not mature and had not been tested in 1958 may be improved and widely applied in 1959 by summarizing experience, overcoming shortcomings, and carrying forward strengths.

The most important favorable condition for realizing the 1959 plan is that the broad masses of cadres and people have raised their political awareness, strengthened their political unity, and mastered the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and a set of "walking on two legs" policies. Everyone has a strong confidence: as long as we advance along this correct road, our country will definitely be able to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products ahead of schedule, and will definitely be able to change the economic face of our country and improve the living standards of our people more quickly.

In 1959, we will continue to receive assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries. According to the agreement between the Chinese and Soviet governments, the Soviet government helped our country build a total of 211 major projects during our country's First Five-Year Plan; in the process of implementation, due to the merged construction of several projects, the total number of Soviet-aided projects changed to 166. Of these projects, 113 were completed in whole or in part and put into production before this year. Starting this year, in addition to continuing to help our country build projects for which agreements have been signed in the past, according to the two agreements signed by the Chinese and Soviet governments on August 8, 1958, and February 7, 1959, the Soviet Union will also help our country build 125 enterprises.

In short, there are many favorable conditions for the continued great leap forward of the national economy this year. However, we must also see that completing the 1959 plan is a very arduous task. The plan stipulates that the production indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton are all equal to about three times the actual output in 1957. During our country's First Five-Year Plan, the total steel output for five years was only 16.67 million tons, while 18 million tons will be produced in 1959 alone. This is certainly not an easy task. The production of grain and cotton is currently lacking the necessary agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, and the ability to resist natural disasters is not strong. It is also obvious that it is difficult to increase grain production by 300 billion jin and cotton production by 33.62 million dan on the basis of doubling the output in 1958. We should be fully mentally prepared for the difficulties of possible serious natural disasters in agriculture. We must first despise difficulties strategically, which is undoubtedly. However, after the plan for continued leap forward has been set, the main problem is to fully value difficulties tactically, overcome paralysis and complacency, seize the opportunity, mobilize all positive factors, and take various practical and effective measures to seriously overcome difficulties.

In order to ensure the completion and strive for over-fulfillment of the 1959 plan, we believe that among the various organizational measures that must be taken at present, the most important link is to immediately launch a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution on all fronts of the national economy.

All aspects of the national economy have made great progress in last year's anti-conservatism and anti-waste movement. However, the possibility of technological progress is unlimited, and it must not be assumed that the work in 1958 has already "reached the top". Take the steel industry as an example. In the first quarter of this year, the blast furnace of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has already reached a daily iron production of 2.15 tons per cubic meter of volume, and Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 and No. 3 blast furnaces have also leaped to more than 2 tons in early April, while the national average of large blast furnaces is 1.4 tons. The open hearth furnace of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant has already reached a daily steel production of 13 tons per square meter of hearth area, while the national average of open hearth furnaces is 7.3 tons. It can be seen that the possibility of improving the utilization efficiency of blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces is very large. According to the existing equipment capacity, if the utilization efficiency of blast furnaces in large and medium-sized steel plants across the country is improved by 0.1 ton per day, more than 600,000 tons of pig iron can be produced throughout the year; if the utilization efficiency of open hearth furnaces is improved by 1 ton, more than 600,000 tons of steel can be produced throughout the year. Take railway transportation as another example. In the first quarter of this year, Fuxin Station and Fuxin Coal Mine cooperated closely and implemented the method of unified command of railway and mining transportation. After that, the loading time of each train was shortened from more than 14 hours to within 6 hours, thereby greatly saving the turnaround time of freight cars. According to the current situation, if the turnaround time of railway freight cars across the country is shortened by 1 hour, about 10 million tons of goods can be transported throughout the year. These two examples show that we still have great potential in increasing production and practicing economy.

Therefore, we request that all localities, all departments, all enterprises and institutions, and all people's communes must quickly and fully mobilize the masses, and improve labor productivity, increase production, improve quality, oppose waste, and reduce costs through technological innovation and other effective measures, and launch a wave of completing and over-fulfilling the 1959 national economic plan.

The task of launching the movement to increase production and practice economy on the industrial front is to carry forward the creative spirit of the staff and workers, renovate production equipment and production tools, improve production processes and operating methods, and improve product design in order to improve the production efficiency of equipment, save raw materials, save labor, and overcome certain difficulties in the great leap forward, such as insufficient raw materials, equipment, and labor.

The broad masses of workers and staff are most familiar with the equipment and tools they use, and are most willing to renovate them. Since last year, the staff and workers of many enterprises have made many creations in this regard. Some workers have installed two tool holders on a lathe, and some workers have installed several drill bits on a drilling machine, which has greatly improved the capacity of mechanical equipment; some workers have modified small machine tools to produce large products, making small machine tools act as large machine tools, which is called "ants gnawing bones". Shanghai Yongxin Seamless Steel Tube Factory is not large in scale and its equipment is very old. At the beginning of this year, after more than 40 days of hard and clever work by all staff and workers, using old materials to renovate equipment and tools, the factory made the three main production processes continuous and basically realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of six important production links. This has increased labor productivity by 2.4 times compared to before the renovation, and greatly reduced the labor intensity of workers. We hope that all industrial and mining enterprises across the country can develop the experience in this area, and according to needs, rely on the strength of the enterprises themselves to make old equipment "rejuvenate" and new equipment "add flowers", and actively tap the potential of existing production equipment.

In the technological innovation of industrial enterprises, everything should be tested, and production processes and operating methods should be widely improved, processes should be reasonably simplified, processing processes should be shortened, and new processing methods should be used to replace old processing methods. In the process of carrying out technological innovation, enterprise leaders must strive to improve the technical level of workers, especially the proficiency of new workers, improve labor organization, and strengthen production management.

Improving product design, reasonably simplifying product structure, and reducing unnecessary parts and components can not only save raw materials and save man-hours, but also improve product quality and improve product efficiency. All enterprises should conduct the work of improving product design under leadership.

Not only should modern large and medium-sized enterprises intensify technological innovation, but also small enterprises using indigenous methods should intensify technological innovation. At present, some small enterprises using indigenous methods consume more labor and raw materials, and the quality of products is not good enough. This situation can be gradually changed by adopting technological innovation methods. For example, Baiyu Iron and Steel Plant in Kaixian County, Sichuan Province, was originally a group of earthen furnaces, and the conditions of resources were not very good. Since it developed into a small iron and steel joint enterprise in December last year, it has changed the previous backward production situation due to grasping the central link of technological innovation and carrying out a mass movement for high-yield and high-quality products. In mid-February of this year, the factory reduced nearly half of its labor force, while the average daily output of pig iron increased by 20 percent, the sulfur content of pig iron decreased to below 0.05, and the cost also decreased by 11 percent.

Whether it is heavy industrial products or light industrial products, excellent quality must be guaranteed. This is an important task of increasing production and practicing economy. All enterprises should regularly pay attention to strengthening technical management, abide by process regulations and operating regulations, eliminate waste products, reduce defective products, strictly implement the inspection system from raw materials, semi-finished products to finished products, and strive to ensure that every product leaving the factory meets the quality standards stipulated by the state.

There are many ways to increase production and practice economy in industrial enterprises. In addition to the above, attention should also be paid to strengthening the management of raw materials, accelerating the turnover of funds, reducing non-production personnel, and saving management costs, and achieve greater results than last year.

On the agricultural front, a mass movement for large-scale high-yield production should be launched, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture should be implemented, and efforts should be made to realize the "Ten Initiatives" proposed by the National Congress of Representatives of Advanced Units in Socialist Construction in Agriculture in January this year. At present, the focus should be on doing a good job in spring plowing and sowing, improving the quality of sowing, and carrying out reasonable deep plowing and reasonable close planting according to different land conditions. The planned output of summer harvest crops in our country this year accounts for about 30 percent of the total grain output of the year. Striving for a bumper harvest of summer harvest crops is of great significance to the continued leap forward of agriculture this year. Therefore, field management of crops such as winter wheat, early rice, and rapeseed should be vigorously strengthened, lodging should be prevented and pests and diseases should be controlled in a timely manner, and agricultural tools for harvesting should be prepared as soon as possible.

Implementing deep plowing and close planting requires a large amount of fertilizer. All people's communes must earnestly do a good job in accumulating fertilizer and making fertilizer, and pay attention to increasing efficient fertilizers and paying attention to reasonable fertilization.

In 1958 and this spring, various localities built a large number of water conservancy projects, which is a favorable condition for increasing agricultural production this year. In order to give play to the role of these projects, channels should be repaired or improved, land should be leveled, water storage and conservation should be strengthened, the efficiency of existing water lifting tools should be improved, and efforts should be made to repair one place, manage it well, and use it well. Irrigation technology should also be improved, and the methods of shallow water frequent irrigation, ditch irrigation, and furrow irrigation should be universally promoted to achieve reasonable irrigation and save water.

Whether it is deep plowing and close planting, accumulating fertilizer and transporting fertilizer, or giving play to the role of water conservancy projects, strengthening field management, etc., a large amount of labor is required, and the current rural labor force is insufficient. In order to solve this contradiction, it is not only necessary to rationally arrange the rural labor force, improve labor organization, and streamline the non-production personnel of the commune, but also to strive to improve labor productivity. To this end, it is necessary to continue to carry out the tool reform movement, especially to pay attention to reforming those tools that can save more labor, such as tools for repairing water conservancy and tools for farming, transportation, etc. Due to the comprehensive implementation of the reform of spring plowing tools from cultivated land and fertilizer transportation to sowing, the work efficiency in Tongren County, Guizhou has been increased by more than doubled. Various localities should conscientiously do a good job in reforming tools according to local characteristics and agricultural needs. Each commune should establish factories for repairing, matching, and manufacturing agricultural tools as much as possible. Each prefecture and even each county should establish specialized institutions as much as possible to be responsible for the research, trial production, and promotion of improved agricultural tools. While reforming agricultural tools, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance and technical training.

In the movement to increase production and practice economy in agriculture, the production responsibility system must be effectively strengthened. Production teams, production squads, or work groups should implement the "three guarantees" method of guaranteeing output, guaranteeing cost, and guaranteeing work. After full discussion by the masses, the production targets and production measures should be stipulated for each piece of land, and the responsibility should be stipulated for each commune member, so as to fully give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the production teams, production squads, work groups, and commune members.

We should strive to promote the increase in agricultural production, and at the same time pay attention to saving. Practicing diligence and thrift in communes and opposing any waste of the commune's human resources, material resources, and financial resources is an important condition for consolidating the people's communes. No matter how big a harvest we get, all people's communes should use grain in a planned way and oppose wasting grain.

On the basic construction front, the broad masses of workers and staff created the construction methods of more, faster, better, and more economical in 1958, that is, the method of rapid construction. The content of this method is: queuing construction projects and concentrating the use of manpower and material resources; improving labor organization, changing single-type work teams into multi-type work teams, implementing the so-called "three-dimensional cross-parallel flow operation"; reforming tools in large quantities, manufacturing indigenous machinery and semi-foreign and semi-indigenous machinery, implementing semi-mechanized and mechanized construction, and using prefabricated components. In this way, the construction period is greatly shortened, labor is saved, and workers become "all-rounders". This construction method also played a certain role in ensuring project quality and reducing project costs. In 1959, this construction method should continue to be promoted and improved.

In basic construction work, we must pay close attention to the issue of quality. Poor project quality will cause rework in some cases, resulting in waste of manpower, material resources, and financial resources and delaying project progress; in other cases, it will cause project accidents or long-term unreasonable phenomena in production. Guaranteeing excellent project quality with the same manpower, material resources, and time is the greatest saving in construction work. Striving to improve project quality is a regular and basic task for all staff and workers in the basic construction department. In the design, the quality of the building structure should be guaranteed. In the construction, the requirements of the design should be strictly observed, technical management should be strengthened, and the inspection system should be improved, and the broad masses should be mobilized to implement supervision.

The movement to increase production and practice economy in basic construction should not only pay attention to accelerating project progress, improving project quality, and ensuring safety, but also pay attention to saving building materials, improving labor productivity, and reducing project costs.

On the transportation front, the broad masses of workers and staff have created many good experiences in accelerating the turnaround of vehicles and ships and improving transportation efficiency. Widely promoting these experiences is of extreme importance for completing this year's heavy transportation tasks. In railway transportation, various localities are promoting advanced methods such as high platforms, low cargo positions, and landslide-style loading and unloading. One mine in Hegang Coal Mine, Heilongjiang Province, shortened the loading time from three hours to twenty minutes by adopting this method. If this experience is universally promoted across the country, the turnaround of vehicles can be greatly accelerated, thereby increasing the railway freight volume. Some railway units have implemented "piggyback" transportation. For example, the staff and workers of the Xi'an Railway Bureau, in close cooperation with the consignment department, made full use of every returning empty car and underloaded freight car, etc., and under the premise of ensuring driving safety and ensuring punctuality, they piggybacked a total of 96,000 tons of goods from the beginning of November last year to March 20 this year, which is equivalent to saving more than 4,600 freight cars. This experience should be vigorously promoted.

In highway transportation, automobile train operations should be reasonably promoted according to possible conditions, the use of fuel should be greatly saved, alternative fuels should be used, and the maintenance and care of vehicles should be strengthened.

In waterway transportation, the loading and unloading capacity of ports should be strengthened and the berthing time of ships in ports should be shortened. In inland

    关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告
    一九五九年四月二十一日在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上
    国务院副总理兼国家计划委员会主任　李富春
    各位代表：
    我代表国务院向大会提出关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，请予审议。
    一九五八年，我国各族人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，按照社会主义建设总路线所指示的方向，在第一个五年计划胜利完成的基础上，经过一年的努力奋斗，在国民经济的各个战线上都取得了空前伟大的胜利。大家已经从一九五八年国民经济发展情况的公报中看到，在这一年，无论是工农业生产和基本建设，或者是运输业和商业，或者是文化教育、科学研究和卫生事业，都得到了跃进的发展。在农业大跃进和农民群众社会主义觉悟迅速提高的情况下，全国农村实现了人民公社化。这样，在我国就出现了一个全民的全面大跃进的局面。
    关于一九五八年大跃进的意义和原因，周总理的报告已经说得很清楚，我在这里就不再重复了。
    中共中央根据一九五八年形势的发展，在当年十一月召开的第六次全体会议上，总结了国民经济大跃进的经验，并且讨论了一九五九年发展国民经济的主要任务和方针，提出了钢产量一千八百万吨、煤产量三亿八千万吨、粮食产量一万零五百亿斤、棉花产量一亿担的四项指标。这是我们编制一九五九年计划草案的主要依据。这个计划草案，在本月初和本月中，先后经过了中共八届七中全会和国务院全体会议讨论和通过。它的主要内容如下。
    工农业总产值计划为二千八百七十亿元，比一九五八年的二千零五十亿元增长百分之四十，即增加八百二十亿元。
    在工农业总产值中，工业和手工业产值计划为一千六百五十亿元，比一九五八年的一千一百七十亿元增长百分之四十一；农业总产值计划为一千二百二十亿元，比一九五八年的八百八十亿元增长百分之三十九。计划规定的工业和农业的发展速度，体现了党的工业和农业同时并举的方针。
    工业生产方面：一九五九年的工业生产计划，首先注意了原料、材料工业和燃料、动力工业的发展。因为只有有了更多的原料、材料，特别是钢铁，才能制造更多的机器；有了更多的原料、材料、燃料、动力和机器，才能使工业各部门以至国民经济各部门得到更快的发展。同一千八百万吨钢和三亿八千万吨煤的指标相适应，计划规定：生铁产量由一九五八年的一千三百六十九万吨增加到二千三百万吨，发电量由一九五八年的二百七十五亿度增加到四百亿度，水泥产量由一九五八年的九百三十万吨增加到一千二百五十万吨。其他重要的原料、材料和燃料，如原油、木材、硫酸、烧碱、纯碱等产品的产量也将有很大的增长。上述这些产品在一九五九年增加的产量，都将比一九五八年所增加的产量为高。例如，一九五八年比一九五七年，生铁产量增加了七百七十五万吨，发电量增加了八十二亿度，水泥产量增加了二百四十四万吨；而一九五九年比一九五八年，生铁产量将增加九百三十一万吨，发电量将增加一百二十五亿度，水泥产量将增加三百二十万吨。应当说明，在今年生铁和钢的计划产量中，包括一小部分土铁土钢在内。
    一九五九年机器制造工业的生产计划，是按照首先保证原料、材料工业和燃料、动力工业迅速发展的需要，保证运输业和农业发展的需要，适当照顾轻工业发展的需要这样的方针进行安排的。一九五九年，采矿设备、洗煤设备、炼焦设备、轧钢设备和发电设备的产量，都将成倍地增长。例如，发电设备的产量将由一九五八年的八十万瓩增加到二百八十万至三百万瓩，即增长百分之二百五十至百分之二百七十五。水泥设备、化工设备和炼油设备的产量也将有相当大的增长。为了保证运输业发展的需要，计划规定：机车的产量由一九五八年的三百五十台增加到五百五十五台，货车的产量由一九五八年的一万一千辆增加到二万七千至二万八千五百辆，汽车和民用船舶的产量也将有相当大的增长。为了支援农业的发展，计划除了规定化学肥料的产量由一九五八年的八十一万一千吨增加到一百三十万至一百五十万吨以外，机器制造工业将提供二百万马力的排灌机械，三千台拖拉机，一千一百台谷物联合收割机和三千台机动脱粒机。为了适应轻工业发展的要求，一九五九年计划生产棉纺机二百五十万锭，以及必要的造纸设备和制糖设备。为机器制造工业本身所需要的金属切削机床，计划产量为七万至七万五千台（不包括简易机床），比一九五八年的五万台增长百分之四十至五十。
      由于农业和重工业的大跃进，一九五九年有可能也有必要较快地发展轻工业。计划规定，棉纱产量由一九五八年的六百一十万件增加到八百五十万件，棉布产量由一九五八年的五十七亿公尺增加到七十二亿公尺，纸产量由一九五八年的一百六十三万吨增加到二百二十万吨，食用植物油产量由一九五八年的一百二十五万吨增加到一百八十万吨，糖产量由一九五八年的九十万吨增加到一百五十万吨，原盐产量由一九五八年的一千零四十万吨增加到一千三百万吨。这些产品将比一九五八年增长百分之二十五到百分之六十七。
    根据上述安排，一九五九年生产资料工业的产值将达到九百八十亿元，比一九五八年的六百七十亿元增长百分之四十六；生活资料工业的产值将达到六百七十亿元，比一九五八年的五百亿元增长百分之三十四。可见，一九五九年的工业生产计划，贯彻了重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针，贯彻了优先发展重工业、首先是发展原料、材料工业和以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针。
    农业生产方面：一九五九年发展农业的任务，是用最大的努力，争取粮食产量跃进到一万零五百亿斤，棉花产量跃进到一亿担，提前实现全国农业发展纲要关于粮棉增产的要求，并且使各类经济作物和林业、畜牧业、副业、渔业都得到普遍的发展。
    按照增产的可能性和轻工业发展的需要，计划规定：黄麻和洋麻的产量达到一千万担，比一九五八年的六百五十万担增长百分之五十四；甘蔗的产量达到四亿担，比一九五八年的二亿七千零五十万担增长百分之四十八；甜菜的产量达到一亿一千万担，比一九五八年的五千八百万担增长百分之九十；大豆的产量达到三百亿斤，比一九五八年的二百五十亿斤增长百分之二十；花生的产量达到一亿二千万担，比一九五八年的八千万担增长百分之五十；油菜子的产量达到三千二百万担，比一九五八年的二千二百万担增长百分之四十五。
    粮食、棉花和其他农作物增产的主要途径，是提高单位面积产量。同时，必须保持一定的播种面积，并且有计划地扩大国营农牧场的耕地。一九五九年全国的播种面积计划为二十一亿亩，其中粮食的播种面积为十六亿亩，棉花的播种面积为一亿亩。计划还规定扩大灌溉面积一亿亩。
    为了增加农业中的畜力，计划规定各种大家畜的饲养总数达到九千万头，比一九五八年的八千五百零六万头增长百分之六。为了增加副食品的供应和增加肥料，计划要求猪的饲养数达到二亿八千万头，比一九五八年的一亿八千万头增长百分之五十六；羊的饲养数达到一亿二千万头，比一九五八年的一亿零八百八十六万头增长百分之十。此外，要求扩大蔬菜的播种面积和积极发展水产事业；在城市和厂矿区附近，应当建立和扩大副食品的生产基地。
    在大力增产粮食和棉花的基础上，应当实行农业的多种经营，发展人民公社的商品生产。
    基本建设方面：一九五九年国家对基本建设的投资总额计划为二百七十亿元，比一九五八年的二百一十四亿元增长百分之二十六。在投资总额中，工业部门为一百七十七亿四千万元，农业、林业和水利部门为十九亿二千万元，运输和邮电部门为五十五亿五千万元，商业、粮食、物资储备部门为三亿元，文教卫生部门为六亿五千万元，城市建设为四亿八千万元，其他为三亿六千万元。一九五九年的基本建设投资较多地集中在工业和运输部门，一方面是为着保证重点建设的需要，另一方面是因为人民公社对农业的基本建设将有比较多的投资，国家还将从预算中另外拨出十亿元帮助人民公社发展生产，其中大部分也将用于农业的基本建设。在工业部门的投资总额中，冶金、电力、煤炭、石油、化学、木材、建筑材料等工业部门的投资为一百二十四亿九千万元，占百分之七十，这是为了使原料、材料工业和燃料、动力工业的生产能力在近期内有较大的增长。
    一九五九年的基本建设投资总额，分配给中央各部门直属企业和直属单位的为一百五十四亿七千万元，分配给各地方所属企业和所属单位的为一百一十五亿三千万元。今年分配给地方的基本建设投资，在投资总额中所占的比重为百分之四十二点七，比往年有了显著的提高。
    计划规定，一九五九年施工的限额以上的建设项目有一千零九十二个，其中：重工业的建设项目为六百九十三个，轻工业的建设项目为一百六十一个，水利的建设项目为二十八个，运输和邮电的建设项目为一百八十六个，商业的建设项目为九个，文化教育的建设项目为十五个。上述重工业和轻工业建设项目，计划在今年内全部建成和部分建成投入生产的有六百七十个。
      计划规定，一九五九年建设的铁路，包括新的干线、支线、企业专用线和复线在内，共有五千五百公里。因为一九五九年增加的货运量主要集中在现有铁路，因此，铁路的建设，将首先加强原有的线路。
    运输方面：为了保证工农业生产和基本建设的继续跃进，一九五九年的铁路货运量计划为五亿二千万吨，比一九五八年的三亿八千万吨增长百分之三十六；交通部直属企业的货运量计划为三千五百万吨，比一九五八年的二千八百万吨增长百分之二十五。此外，各地方还分别规定了发展公路和水路运输的指标。
    商业方面：一九五九年的社会商品零售总额计划为六百五十亿元，比一九五八年的五百四十八亿元增长百分之十九。通过商业机构供应给人民的粮食、肉类、食用植物油、水产品、盐、棉布、针织品、呢绒、卷烟和其他日用品，都将比一九五八年有所增长。
    文化教育事业方面：计划规定，一九五九年高等学校招生二十五万人，在校学生达到八十三万人，比一九五八年增长百分之二十五点八；中等专业学校招生七十万人，在校学生达到一百八十二万人，比一九五八年增长百分之二十三点八；高级中学招生六十五万人，在校学生达到一百五十二万人，比一九五八年增长百分之二十八点八。一九五九年的初中教育、小学教育、业余教育和扫除文盲的工作，都将由各地方按照当地的实际情况，分别规定适当的指标。一九五九年的文化事业、科学研究事业、卫生事业、体育事业都将随着生产的发展而得到进一步的发展。
    从上面所说的情况可以看出，一九五九年国民经济计划是一个继续大跃进的计划。
    实现这样一个继续大跃进的计划是必要的。我们在一九五八年实现了工农业的大跃进，钢、煤、粮食、棉花的产量都比一九五七年增长了一倍以上，但是已经达到的经济发展水平，对于我们这样一个六亿多人口的大国说来，仍然是很低的。一九五八年的产量按人口平均，每人只有钢三十多斤，煤将近九百斤，粮食一千二百多斤，棉花十一斤。显然，这离开满足国家建设和人民生活的需要还很远。这也就是这些产品以及其他的许多产品虽然产量有了很大的增长，供应仍然显得紧张的基本原因。正因为这样，如中共中央关于人民公社若干问题的决议所说，我们必须苦战三年，加上再努力若干年，才能使全国的经济面貌有一个很大的改变。
    实现这样一个继续大跃进的计划，经过全国人民的努力奋斗，也是可能的。
    首先，一九五八年工业生产的大跃进，为一九五九年的继续跃进提供了有利的物质技术条件。一九五八年生产资料工业的生产量比一九五七年增长了百分之一百零三；重要的生产资料，如钢、生铁、煤炭、发电设备、机车、汽车、动力机械、谷物联合收割机等等的产量，都比一九五七年增长了一倍以上。在一九五八年，全国约有七百个限额以上的工矿建设单位全部建成或者部分建成投入了生产；此外，还有大量的限额以下的工矿建设单位建成而投入了生产。我国过去不能生产的容积为一千五百一十三立方公尺的大高炉、板面宽度为二千三百公厘的中厚钢板的轧机、容量为二万五千瓩的火力发电设备、压力为二千五百吨的锻造水压机，都在一九五八年试制成功了。在农业的基本建设方面，我们在一九五八年增加了灌溉面积四亿八千万亩。在铁路运输方面，我们修建了三千五百六十四公里的铁路；铁路货运量也由一九五七年的二亿七千多万吨增加到三亿八千万吨。这些重大的成就都将对今年国民经济的继续跃进发生巨大的作用。
    其次，由于农村中实现了人民公社化，农业生产力得到了进一步的解放。广大的农村妇女减少了家务拖累，兴高采烈地参加了农业生产。同时，几百万劳动力从农业战线转到了工业战线。这就大大地加强了工业和农业的生产力量。生产战线上的这部分生力军，经过一个时期的锻炼，劳动的熟练程度将很快地得到提高。
    再次，在工业、农业、运输业、商业等各个战线上，都在一九五八年的大跃进中积累了大量的技术经验和组织经验。广大的劳动群众学会了多快好省地进行生产和施工的有效办法，展开了不断改进工作和大胆发明创造的群众运动。许多在一九五八年还不成熟、还没有经过考验的措施，在一九五九年将有可能通过总结经验、克服缺点、发扬优点，得到比较完善和比较广泛的应用。
    实现一九五九年计划的最重要的有利条件是，广大的干部和群众提高了政治觉悟，加强了政治团结，掌握了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和一套“两条腿走路”的方针。大家有了坚强的信心：只要沿着这条正确的道路前进，我国就一定能够提前实现在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国的任务，一定能够较快地改变我国的经济面貌和提高我国人民的生活水平。
    一九五九年，我们将继续得到苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家的援助。根据中苏两国政府的协议，苏联政府在我国第一个五年计划期间帮助我国建设的重大项目共有二百一十一个；在执行的过程中，由于若干项目合并建设，苏联援助的项目总数改变为一百六十六个。这些项目，在今年以前全部建成和部分建成投入生产的有一百一十三个。从今年开始，苏联除了继续帮助我国建设过去已经签定协议的项目以外，根据一九五八年八月八日和一九五九年二月七日中苏两国政府先后签定的两次协议，还将帮助我国进行一百二十五个企业的建设。
    总之，今年国民经济的继续大跃进，有利条件是很多的。但是，我们也必须看到，完成一九五九年计划是一项十分艰巨的任务。计划规定的钢、煤、粮食、棉花的生产指标，都等于一九五七年实际产量的三倍左右。我国在第一个五年计划期间，五年合计的钢的总产量不过一千六百六十七万吨，而一九五九年一年内就将生产一千八百万吨。这当然不是一件轻而易举的事情。粮食和棉花的生产，目前我们还缺乏必需的农业机器和化学肥料，抵抗自然灾害侵袭的力量还不强，要在一九五八年产量增长一倍的基础上，再增产粮食三千亿斤和棉花三千三百六十二万担，任务的艰巨性也很明显。我们对于农业上可能遇到严重的自然灾害的困难，应当有充分的精神准备。我们必须首先在战略上藐视困难，这是毫无疑义的。但是，在继续跃进的计划已经定下来以后，主要的问题就是要在战术上充分重视困难，克服麻痹大意和自满的倾向，抓紧时机，调动一切积极因素，采取各种切实有效的措施去认真战胜困难。
    为了保证一九五九年计划的完成和争取超额完成，我们以为，在当前必须采取的各项组织措施中，最重要的一个环节，就是立即在国民经济的各个战线上，开展一个全民的以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。
    国民经济的各个方面，在去年的反保守反浪费运动中都获得了巨大的进步。但是，技术进步的可能性是无限的，决不能认为一九五八年的工作已经“到了顶”。拿钢铁工业来说。今年第一季度，本溪第一炼铁厂的高炉，每一立方公尺容积每昼夜的产铁量已经达到二点一五吨，鞍钢的九号高炉和三号高炉在四月初也已经跃进到二吨以上，而全国大高炉的平均数却是一点四吨。上海第三炼钢厂的平炉，每一平方公尺的炉底面积每一昼夜的产钢量已经达到十三吨，而全国平炉的平均数却是七点三吨。可见，提高高炉和平炉利用效率的可能性是很大的。按照现有的设备能力，全国大中型的钢铁厂，高炉的利用效率每提高零点一吨，全年就可以增产生铁六十多万吨；平炉的利用效率每提高一吨，全年就可以增产钢六十多万吨。再拿铁路运输来说。今年第一季度，阜新车站和阜新煤矿密切合作，实行了铁路和矿山运输统一指挥的办法以后，每一列车的装车时间从原来的十四小时多缩短到六小时以内，从而大大节约了货车周转的时间。按照今年的情况，全国铁路货车的周转时间每缩短一小时，全年就可以多运输货物一千万吨左右。这两个例子说明，我们在增产节约方面还拥有很大的潜力。
    因此，我们要求，各个地方、各个部门、各个企业单位、各个事业单位、各个人民公社，都要迅速地充分地动员群众，通过技术革新和其他的有效措施，来提高劳动生产率，增加生产，提高质量，反对浪费，降低成本，掀起一个完成和超额完成一九五九年国民经济计划的热潮。
    在工业战线上开展增产节约运动的任务，是发扬职工群众的创造精神，革新生产设备和生产工具，改善生产工艺和操作方法，改进产品的设计，以便提高设备的生产效率，节约原料、材料，节约劳动力，克服大跃进中某些原料、材料、设备和劳动力不足的困难。
    广大的职工群众对于他们使用的设备和工具，是最熟悉的，也是最乐于加以革新的。从去年以来，许多企业的职工在这方面有了很多的创造。有的职工在一台车床上装两付刀架，有的职工在一台钻床上装几个钻头，这样就大大地提高了机械设备的能力；有的职工把小的机床加以改装，生产大的产品，使小机床顶大机床用，也就是所谓“蚂蚁啃骨头”。上海永鑫无缝钢管厂，规模不大，设备很旧，今年初经过全体职工四十多天的苦干、巧干，利用旧料革新设备和工具，使全厂三道主要生产工序做到了连续化，使六个重要的生产环节基本上实现了机械化和半机械化，就使劳动生产率比革新前提高了二点四倍，同时大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。我们希望全国所有的工矿企业，都能够发展这一方面的经验，根据需要，依靠企业本身的力量，使旧设备“返老还童”，使新设备“锦上添花”，积极挖掘现有生产设备的潜力。
    在工业企业的技术革新中，应当一切经过试验，广泛地改善生产工艺和操作方法，合理地简化工序，缩短加工过程，用新的加工方法来代替旧的加工方法。在进行技术革新的过程中，企业的领导必须努力提高工人的技术水平，特别是提高新工人的熟练程度，改善劳动组织和加强生产管理。
    改进产品的设计，合理地简化产品的结构，减少不必要的部件和零件，不仅可以节约原料、材料，节省工时，而且可以提高产品的质量，提高产品的使用效能。各个企业应当有领导地进行改进产品设计的工作。
    不但是现代化的大中型企业应当加紧进行技术革新，土法生产的小型企业尤其应当加紧进行技术革新。在目前，有一部分土法生产的小型企业，占用的劳动力和消耗的原料、材料都比较多，产品的质量也不够好，这种情况，采取技术革新的方法，是完全可以逐步改变的。例如，四川省开县的白玉钢铁厂，原是一个土炉群，资源的条件也不大好，自从去年十二月发展成为小型钢铁联合企业以后，由于抓紧了技术革新这一中心环节，开展了高产优质的群众运动，就改变了过去生产比较落后的状况。今年二月中旬，这个厂减少了将近一半的劳动力，而生铁的平均日产量反而提高了百分之二十，生铁的含硫量降低到零点零五以下，成本也降低了百分之十一。
    无论是重工业产品，或者是轻工业产品，都必须保证优良的质量。这是增产节约的一项重要任务。所有企业，都应当经常地注意加强技术管理，遵守工艺规程和操作规程，消灭废品，减少次品，严格执行从原料、材料、半成品直到成品的检验制度，努力争取每一件出厂的产品都符合国家规定的质量标准。
    工业企业中增产节约的门路很多。除了以上所说的以外，在加强原料、材料管理、加速资金周转、减少非生产人员、节约管理费用等方面，也都应当加以重视，做出比去年更大的成绩。
    在农业战线上，应当开展大面积丰产的群众运动，贯彻执行农业的“八字宪法”，争取实现今年一月间全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的“十大倡议”。在目前，应当着重做好春耕播种工作，提高播种质量，按照不同的土地条件，进行合理的深耕，合理的密植。我国今年夏收粮食作物的计划产量，约占全年粮食总产量的百分之三十左右。争取夏收作物的大丰收，对今年农业的继续跃进有重要意义。因此，应当大力加强冬小麦、早稻、油菜等作物的田间管理，及时地防止倒伏和防治病虫害，并且及早地准备收割的农具。
    实行深耕和密植，需要大量的肥料。所有的人民公社都要认真做好积肥和造肥的工作，并且注意增加效率高的肥料，注意合理施肥。
    一九五八年和今年春季，各地方兴修了大量的水利工程，这是今年农业增产的一个有利条件。为了发挥这些工程的作用，应当修好或者改善渠道，平整土地，加强蓄水和保水的工作，提高现有提水工具的效能，做到修好一处，管好一处，用好一处。灌溉技术也应当注意改进，普遍推广浅水勤灌和沟灌、畦灌的方法，作到合理灌溉，节约用水。
    无论是深耕密植，积肥运肥，或者是发挥水利工程作用，加强田间管理等等，都需要大量的劳动力，而目前农村的劳动力是不足的。为了解决这个矛盾，不但要合理安排农村劳动力，改善劳动组织，精简公社非生产人员，而且要努力提高劳动生产率。为此，必须继续开展工具改革运动，特别是注意改革那些能够节约劳动力比较多的工具，如修水利的工具和耕作、运输等方面的工具。贵州铜仁县由于从耕地、运肥到播种，全面地实行了春耕工具的改革，工效提高了一倍以上。各地方应当根据当地的特点和农活的需要，切实做好改革工具的工作。每个公社要尽可能建立修配和制造农具的工厂。每个专区以至每个县要尽可能成立专门的机构，负责研究、试制和推广改良农具。在改革农具的同时，必须加强技术指导和技术训练的工作。
    在农业的增产节约运动中，要切实地加强生产责任制。生产队、生产小队或者作业组，要实行包产量、包成本、包工的“三包”办法，经过群众充分地讨论，把生产指标和生产措施规定到每一块田地，把责任规定到每个社员，以充分发挥生产队、生产小队、作业组和社员的积极性和创造性。
    我们应当努力促进农业的增产，同时应当注意节约。勤俭办公社，反对对公社人力、物力、财力作任何的浪费，是巩固人民公社的重要条件。无论我们得到了多大的丰收，所有的人民公社都应当有计划地使用粮食和反对浪费粮食。
    在基本建设战线上，广大职工在一九五八年创造了多快好省的施工方法，即快速施工的方法。这种方法的内容是：对施工项目进行排队，把人力和物力集中使用；改善劳动组织，把单工种的工作队改变为多工种的工作队，实行所谓“立体交叉平行流水作业”；大量改革工具，制造土机械和半洋半土的机械，实行半机械化和机械化施工，并且使用预制构件。这样，就大大缩短了工期，节约了劳动力，并且使工人成了“多面手”。这种施工方法，对于保证工程质量和降低工程成本，也起了一定的作用。一九五九年，应当继续推广和提高这种施工方法。
    在基本建设工作中，要切实注意质量的问题。工程质量不好，有的要返工，会造成人力、物力、财力的浪费，拖延工程的进度；有的还会造成工程事故，或者造成生产上的长期不合理现象。用同样的人力物力时间而保证了优良的工程质量，就是建设工作中的最大的节约。为提高工程质量而斗争，是基本建设部门全体职工一项经常的基本的任务。在设计中，应当保证建筑结构的质量。在施工中，应当严格遵守设计的要求，加强技术管理，并且健全检验制度，发动广大群众实行监督。
    基本建设方面的增产节约运动，不但要注意加快工程进度，提高工程质量，保证安全，而且要注意节约建筑材料，提高劳动生产率，降低工程成本。
      在运输战线上，广大职工群众在加速车辆和船只的周转、提高运输效率等方面，创造了许多好的经验。广泛地推广这些经验，对于完成今年繁重的运输任务有极重要的作用。在铁路运输方面，各地正在推广高站台、低货位以及滑坡式装卸等先进方法。黑龙江省鹤岗煤矿的一个矿井，由于采用了这种方法，装车时间从三小时缩短到二十分钟。如果全国普遍推行这项经验，就可以大大加快车辆的周转，从而增加铁路的货运量。有些铁路单位实行了“捎脚”运输。如西安铁路局的职工，在托运部门的密切配合下，充分利用每一辆回送的空车、载重不足的货车等，在保证行车安全、保证正点的前提下，从去年十一月初到今年三月二十日共捎运货物九万六千吨，等于节省货车四千六百多辆。这一个经验，应当大力推广。
    在公路运输方面，应当根据可能的条件，合理地推行汽车列车化，大力节约油料的使用，采用代用燃料，加强车辆的维修、保养工作。
    在水路运输方面，应当加强港口的装卸能力，缩短船只在港停留时间。在内河航线，应当继续推广顶推运输的方法；在沿海航线，应当推广拖驳运输和拖排运输的方法。
    目前，短途运输是运输战线上的一个薄弱环节。为了加强短途运输，必须大搞民间运输工具的技术革新和技术革命。应当根据条件，逐步推广四轮马车、机动木帆船，在山区推行滑道和索道运输，在运输量大而且有条件的地方，推广轻便的土铁路和木轨道运输。
    在商业战线上，增产节约的主要任务，是做好农副产品、工业品和废品的收购工作，作好生产资料和生活资料的供应工作，更好地为工农业生产的大跃进服务。同时，应当加强经济核算和改善经营管理，从减少商品的损耗和节约运杂费、保管费、包装费等方面，来降低商品的流通费用，增加国家的资金积累。
    无论在那个战线上，开展增产节约运动的要求都必须是多快好省的统一，都必须是数量、质量和安全的统一，决不要片面地强调一个侧面而忽视另一个侧面。在增产节约运动中，要经常地认真地注意提高产品和工程的质量，保证生产、建设和运输的安全。
    目前，工业战线上的高产优质的社会主义红旗竞赛运动，农业战线上的大面积丰产的竞赛运动，运输战线上以合理的多拉多载、快卸快装、安全正点为主要内容的竞赛运动，商业战线上的以促进生产、执行政策、完成计划、改善经营管理、提高服务质量、向红专进军为内容的“六好”红旗运动，在全国各地正在开始发展。这些不同形式的增产节约运动，是一九五八年各个经济战线上大规模群众运动的继续，是完成一九五九年计划的主要保证。现在运动的发展还不平衡，许多地方对于运动的领导还抓得不紧。目前的任务就是要克服这些薄弱环节，使运动普遍地发动起来和深入下去。
    要把全民的增产节约运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来，必须进一步放手发动群众，要把各项工作任务的内容，提出任务的理由，可能出现的困难，克服困难、完成任务的基本途径，向群众交代清楚，并且发动群众展开鸣放辩论，倾听各方面群众的意见。要召集基层干部、积极分子和普通劳动者的会议，使上情充分下达，下情充分上达，以便通过活泼的、切实的讨论，充分发现问题，找到解决问题的具体办法。群众的智慧是无穷的，许多困难在摆到群众面前讨论以后，常常很快地就迎刃而解。宝鸡市宝成仪表厂，一部分干部本来对于实现今年大跃进计划的信心不大，但是，把计划交给全厂职工讨论，干部深入车间和小组，参加生产，搞“试验田”以后，干部和职工的信心和干劲大增，措施也越来越具体。领导干部、技术人员和工人群众三结合，实行任务到班，零件过关，就产品的每一个零件议出结论：需要改设计的，就革新设计；需要改工艺的，就革新工艺；需要改工具的，就革新工具。结果，今年一月份的总产值完成计划百分之一百三十六，二月份总产值完成计划百分之一百一十八。这种把任务向群众交底，干部参加生产，工人参加管理，干部、工人和技术人员相结合的群众路线的工作方法，应当在全国所有的企业中间普及起来。
    经济战线上的一切领导工作人员，不仅要关心生产的状况，而且要关心群众的思想政治状况。要继续贯彻执行干部下放、干部定期参加体力劳动、干部和群众同吃同住同劳动的办法，巩固干部和群众的亲密联系。必须经常关心群众的生活状况，注意使群众的生活在生产发展的基础上有所改善，使按劳分配、多劳多得的原则得到贯彻，使苦战和休息有适当的结合。我们这样做了，就一定可以团结最大多数的群众，发挥最大多数群众的积极性和创造性，我们的事业也就一定能够胜利地向前发展。
    群众运动和集中领导相结合，是党和国家一贯的方针。群众运动的大规模开展，要求我们加强集中领导，以便把中央、地方和企业的力量更好地结合起来，同心协力，扭成一股劲，保证完成国家计划。对于各项任务，应当按照轻重缓急进行“排队”，首先保证完成主要的任务。在各个经济战线上都应当抓紧组织工作和具体措施，使各个方面的工作得到密切的配合，协调一致地向前发展。各个地方、各个部门、各个企业、各个人民公社、各个事业单位，对于国家规定的生产、建设、运输、协作、调拨、收购等方面的任务，都必须按时、按量、按质地完成。在国家企业中，要加强党委的统一领导，贯彻执行党委领导下的厂长负责制，并且确立、健全和严格执行各种必要的、合理的规章制度，使生产建设工作在统一的指挥下有秩序地进行。在人民公社中，应当实行统一领导和分级管理、分级核算相结合的方针，迅速地把各项管理制度建立和健全起来。
    各位代表！一九五九年发展国民经济的计划是一个宏伟的、艰巨的、但是可以完成的计划。让我们动员起来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，坚持党的建设社会主义的总路线，运用和发扬一九五八年大跃进的成功经验，鼓足干劲、力争上游，为实现一九五九年的继续跃进而斗争！我们一定要完成这个计划，我们一定能够完成这个计划！
