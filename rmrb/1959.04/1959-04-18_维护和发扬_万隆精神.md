　　Upholding and Promoting the "Bandung Spirit"

　　It has been a full four years since the historically significant Bandung Conference was held. Looking back at the path the Asian and African people have traversed over these four years, people all over the world can feel the tremendous influence of the "Bandung Spirit" in international affairs, especially in the political life of the Asian and African people.

　　Four years ago, from the podium of the Independence Palace in Bandung, Indonesia, the 1.6 billion people of Asia and Africa issued a joint proclamation denouncing imperialism and colonialism. The resolution of the Bandung Conference declared to the world: "Colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil that should be eradicated swiftly." The conference strongly supported the cause of all colonial peoples in their struggle for freedom and independence, and supported all struggles against racial discrimination. Under the call and encouragement of this spirit, the Asian and African people launched a powerful impact on the imperialist and colonial system. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in 1957, the Conference of Independent African States in 1958, the All-African People's Conference, and other important international conferences held in Asian and African countries during this period, all inherited and further promoted the "Bandung Spirit," mobilizing hundreds of millions of people in Asian and African countries to fight for the great cause of opposing imperialism and colonialism.

　　In the four years since the Bandung Conference, tremendous changes have taken place in the Asian and African situation. With the full support of the world's peace forces and the Asian and African people, the Egyptian people won the struggle to recover the Suez Canal Company and resist the Anglo-French-Israeli war of aggression; the Syrian people successively shattered the conspiracies of subversion and armed threat by U.S. imperialism. The U.S. and British imperialist aggressor troops were forced to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. The Eisenhower Doctrine was rejected by the people of the Middle East and Arab countries. In particular, the victory of the Iraqi people's revolution dealt a fatal blow to imperialist colonial policies in the Middle East and powerfully inspired the national liberation movement in the Asian and African regions. In Southeast Asia, the Indochinese people vigilantly defended the Geneva Accords, and the Cambodian people successively frustrated the subversion plots engineered by U.S. imperialism. The Indonesian people achieved victory in opposing the armed rebellion supported by imperialism. The military aggression blocs established by U.S. imperialism in Asia have met with increasingly strong opposition from the Asian and African people. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is riddled with internal contradictions. The Baghdad Pact group has been paralyzed. The "Bandung Spirit" inspires the Asian people to advance towards independence and freedom; it also inspires the African people to rise up and shatter the shackles of colonialism. After the Bandung Conference, African countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, Sudan, Ghana, and Guinea successively gained independence, and the armed struggles of the Algerian and Cameroonian people are in full swing. In West Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, and South Africa, national independence movements are surging, shaking the entire imperialist colonial system.

　　On the basis of the "Bandung Spirit," the Asian and African people have continuously strengthened friendly cooperation and solidarity, and have made great contributions to the cause of safeguarding world peace. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, namely mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, as well as the Ten Principles adopted by the Bandung Conference, have not only taken root in the hearts of the people in the Asian and African regions, but are also being recognized by more and more countries around the world as the norms for handling international relations. Not long ago, President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and President Sukarno of Indonesia reiterated in their talks that the principles unanimously adopted by the Bandung Asian-African Conference can serve as a solid foundation for countries to cooperate in strengthening lasting world peace. The victory of the principles of peaceful coexistence in the Asian and African region is the victory of the people of all countries in safeguarding national independence and state sovereignty, and it is also the victory of the forces of peace over the forces of aggression.

　　It must be pointed out that while the "Bandung Spirit" has become the mainstream in the political life of the Asian and African people, the imperialist aggressive blocs headed by the United States are constantly creating divisive and anti-peace currents. U.S. imperialism continues to pursue a policy of war and aggression in Asia. After the Baghdad Pact group was shattered, the United States signed bilateral military agreements with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, attempting to reorganize the remnants and launch new offensives against the independence and peace of the Middle East and Arab countries. U.S. imperialism is doing its utmost to provoke relations between Arab countries, vigorously promoting the so-called "unstable situation" in Iraq, and using Arabs to oppose Arabs. In Southeast Asia, the United States has recently carried out a series of conspiracies, trying to tear up the Geneva Accords guaranteeing peace in Indochina, and also planned to establish the so-called "mobile force" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to carry out armed intervention and military aggression against Southeast Asia, especially the Indochinese countries, creating new tensions. At the same time, U.S. imperialism continues to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, conspiring to create "two Chinas," and recently attempted to use the Tibetan rebellion to interfere in China's internal affairs. All of these constitute a serious threat to the national independence and peaceful security of Asian countries. In Africa, U.S. imperialism is also colluding with other imperialist countries, attempting to stifle the right to self-determination of African nations and suppress the national liberation movement in Africa. The Asian and African people remember very clearly that the "Bandung Spirit" was born under the frenzied hatred and sabotage of U.S. imperialism. The facts of the past four years have more forcefully proved that U.S. imperialism is the irreconcilable mortal enemy of the "Bandung Spirit"!

　　In the activities of imperialism to undermine the "Bandung Spirit," the Tito group of Yugoslavia is playing a shameful role. It distorts the essence of the "Bandung Spirit" under the guise of being a defender of the "Bandung Spirit." The Tito group vainly attempts to surreptitiously replace the "Bandung Spirit," which resolutely opposes imperialism and colonialism, with so-called "active coexistence" that essentially leans towards imperialism and opposes socialism, provoking relations between Asian and African countries, and between Asian and African countries and socialist countries, facilitating the imperialist offensive against the Asian and African people. This cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the Asian and African people.

　　The Chinese people have consistently been faithful to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference in international affairs. We firmly support the just struggle of the Asian and African countries against imperialism and colonialism, and for the attainment and protection of national independence; our friendly and cooperative relations with the Asian and African countries on the basis of these principles are developing day by day. The "Bandung Spirit" embodies the characteristics of our era and the common will of the 1.6 billion people of Asia and Africa. The Asian and African people will never allow imperialism and its followers to undermine the "Bandung Spirit." The Chinese people will work together with the Asian and African people to resolutely uphold and continue to promote the "Bandung Spirit." We firmly believe that all the sabotage conspiracies of imperialism will surely fail, and the "Bandung Spirit" will continue to radiate its brilliance!

### 维护和发扬“万隆精神”

　　维护和发扬“万隆精神”
    自从具有历史意义的万隆会议召开以来，到今天已经整整的四个年头了。回顾亚非人民这四年来走过的道路，全世界的人们都能感觉到“万隆精神”在国际事务中，特别是在亚非人民的政治生活中所发生的巨大影响。
    四年以前，在印度尼西亚万隆独立宫讲坛上发出了亚非十六亿人民共同声讨帝国主义和殖民主义的檄文。万隆会议的决议向全世界宣布：“殖民主义在其一切表现中是一种应当迅速予以根除的祸害。”会议有力地支持了一切殖民地人民争取自由和独立的事业，支持一切反对种族歧视的斗争。亚非人民在这种精神的号召和鼓舞下向帝国主义和殖民体系发动了强大的冲击。1957年的亚非人民团结大会、1958年非洲独立国家会议、非洲人民大会以及在这个期间亚非国家举行的青年、学生和其他一些重要的国际会议，都继承和进一步发扬了“万隆精神”，动员了亚非各国的亿万人民去为反对帝国主义和殖民主义的伟大事业而斗争。
    万隆会议以后的四年间，亚非形势发生了巨大变化。在全世界和平力量和亚非人民的全力支持下，埃及人民取得了收复苏伊士运河公司的斗争和反抗英、法、以侵略战争的胜利；叙利亚人民接连地粉碎了美帝国主义的颠覆和武力威胁的阴谋。美英帝国主义侵略军被迫撤出了黎巴嫩和约旦。艾森豪威尔主义遭到了中东和阿拉伯各国人民的唾弃。特别是伊拉克人民革命的胜利，给帝国主义在中东的殖民政策以致命的打击，有力地鼓舞了亚非地区的民族解放运动。在东南亚，印度支那人民警惕地捍卫着日内瓦协议，柬埔寨人民接连地挫败了美帝国主义策划的颠覆阴谋案。印度尼西亚人民取得了反对由帝国主义支持的武装叛乱的胜利。美帝国主义在亚洲建立的军事侵略集团，遭到亚非人民越来越强烈的反对。东南亚条约组织内部矛盾重重。巴格达条约集团已告瘫痪。“万隆精神”鼓舞着亚洲人民迈向独立与自由的大道；同时也鼓舞着非洲人民起来粉碎殖民主义的枷锁。万隆会议后，摩洛哥、突尼斯、苏丹、加纳、几内亚等非洲国家相继获得了独立，阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆人民的武装斗争如火如荼。在西非、中非、东非和南非，民族独立运动风起云涌，震撼着整个的帝国主义殖民体系。
    亚非人民在“万隆精神”的基础上，不断地加强着友好合作和团结，并对保卫世界和平的事业作出了巨大的贡献。和平共处的五项原则，即互相尊重领土和主权完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处以及万隆会议所通过的十项原则，不仅在亚非地区已经深入人心，而且在全世界正被越来越多的国家承认为处理国际关系的准则。不久前，越南民主共和国胡志明主席和印度尼西亚苏加诺总统的会谈再一次重申，万隆亚非会议一致通过的原则可以作为各国在加强世界持久和平方面进行合作的牢固基础。和平共处原则在亚非地区所取得的胜利，就是各国人民维护民族独立和国家主权的胜利，也就是和平力量对侵略势力的胜利。
    不能不指出，在“万隆精神”已经成为亚非人民政治生活中的主流的时候，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团，却不断地制造分裂和反和平的逆流。美帝国主义在亚洲继续推行着战争和侵略政策。在巴格达条约集团被打碎以后，美国同土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦签订了双边军事协定，企图重新收拾残局，向中东和阿拉伯各国的独立与和平发动新的进攻。美帝国主义正在极尽挑拨阿拉伯国家关系的能事，大肆宣传伊拉克的所谓“不稳局势”，利用阿拉伯人反对阿拉伯人。在东南亚，美国最近进行了一系列阴谋，力图撕毁保障印度支那和平的日内瓦协议，还策划建立东南亚条约集团的所谓“机动部队”，用来对东南亚，尤其是印度支那各国进行武装干涉和军事侵略，制造新的紧张局势。同时，美帝国主义继续侵占中国的领土台湾，阴谋制造“两个中国”，最近又妄图利用西藏叛乱事件，干涉中国内政。所有这些，形成了对亚洲各国民族独立与和平安全的严重威胁。在非洲，美帝国主义也正和其他帝国主义国家勾结一起，妄图扼杀非洲各民族的自决权利，镇压非洲的民族解放运动。亚非人民记得很清楚，“万隆精神”是在美帝国主义的疯狂仇视和破坏之下诞生的。四年来的事实更加有力地证明，美帝国主义是“万隆精神”的不可调和的死敌！
    在帝国主义竭力破坏“万隆精神”的活动中，南斯拉夫铁托集团扮演着一个可耻的角色。它在“万隆精神”的卫道者的面具下歪曲“万隆精神”的实质。铁托集团妄想偷偷摸摸地用实质上是倒向帝国主义、反对社会主义的所谓“积极共处”来代替坚决反对帝国主义和殖民主义的
  “万隆精神”，挑拨亚非国家之间、亚非国家与社会主义国家之间的关系，便利帝国主义对亚非人民的进攻。这不能不引起亚非人民的严重警惕。
    中国人民在国际事务中一贯忠实于和平共处五项原则和亚非会议的各项决议。我们坚决支持亚非各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的正义斗争；我们和亚非国家之间在这些原则的基础上日益发展着友好合作的关系。“万隆精神”体现了我们这个时代的特征和十六亿亚非人民的共同意志。亚非人民绝不允许帝国主义及其追随者破坏“万隆精神”。中国人民将与亚非人民一道，为坚决维护和继续发扬“万隆精神”而共同努力。我们坚定不移地相信：帝国主义的一切破坏阴谋一定失败，“万隆精神”将继续发射出它的光辉！
