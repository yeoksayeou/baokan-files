　　Stone Arch Bridges

　　Stone arch bridges have a long history in Chinese bridge construction and are one of the outstanding creations of the Chinese working people. This type of bridge is beautiful in form, strong, and durable. The Zhaozhou Bridge in Hebei, built during the Sui Dynasty, is a single-span stone arch bridge of thirty-seven meters built on earthen foundations. It has stood firm for over 1,300 years. Countless ancient stone arch bridges span rivers large and small throughout the country.

　　Building stone arch bridges does not require steel or cement, and materials can be obtained locally, which is of great significance for China's large-scale economic construction. Whether a stone arch bridge is sturdy depends mainly on two conditions: one is that the construction of the arch (i.e., the bridge opening) must be technically sound; too curved is not good, and too straight is not good, it must be curved very appropriately; the second is that the stone cutting must be technically sound, the stones must be large at the top and small at the bottom, and the size must also have a certain ratio. Since 1958, in road construction across the country, the architectural tradition of stone arch bridges has been promoted, and construction technology has been further improved by relying on the wisdom of the masses, resulting in the construction of many economical and beautiful stone arch bridges. In Jiangxi Province, "local experts" used local pebbles and rubble to build many highway stone arch bridges, with large spans of twelve meters and an average cost of more than 400 yuan per meter, which is cheaper than ordinary anti-corrosion wooden bridges. In Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, a three-hole stone arch bridge with a span of thirty meters and a total length of one hundred and fifteen meters was built over the Yan River, which is extremely magnificent.

　　Currently, stone arch bridges are being built on a large scale throughout the country and are developing towards larger spans. Hunan, Shaanxi, Anhui, and other provinces have already designed stone arch bridges with spans of more than fifty meters. Among them, the Huanghugang large stone arch bridge on the Shiqing Highway in Hunan Province, which spans a gorge more than fifty meters deep, has already started construction. The bridge is sixty meters long, truly "seeing a long rainbow fly across, turning a natural barrier into a thoroughfare."

　　石拱桥
    石拱桥在我国桥梁建筑上有着悠久的历史，是我国劳动人民杰出的创造之一。这种桥，形式美观，坚固耐用。隋代所修建的河北赵州桥，就是一座建筑在土质地基上、单跨三十七公尺的石拱桥，至今一千三百多年，仍然屹立无恙。各地跨越大小河川的古代石拱桥，更是不胜枚举。
    建筑石拱桥，不需要钢材和水泥，可以就地取材，对我国大规模经济建设有着重大的意义。一座石拱桥建筑得是否坚固，主要决定于两个条件：一是搭弧形架（即桥洞）要有技术，太弯不行，太直也不行，要弯得非常恰当；二是打石方要有技术，石头要上大下小，大小也要有一定比例。1958年以来，各地在道路建设中，发扬了石拱桥的建筑艺术传统，并依靠群众智慧进一步改进了建筑技术，修造了许多经济美观的石拱桥。江西省的“土专家”，利用当地卵石和乱石，修建了不少公路石拱桥，跨径大的有十二公尺，平均每公尺造价四百多元，比一般防腐木桥还便宜。陕西省在延安的延河上，修建了一座三孔、跨径三十公尺、全长一百一十五公尺的石拱桥，极为雄伟壮观。
    现在各地正在大修石拱桥并向大跨径发展。湖南、陕西、安徽等省已经设计了跨径五十公尺以上的石拱桥。其中已经开工新建的湖南石清公路上跨越深约五十多公尺峡谷的黄虎港大石拱桥，桥长六十公尺，真是“行见长虹飞架，天堑变通途。”
