Capital Rally Supports Algerian People's Struggle for National Independence
Telegram to the Algerian People

To the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic in Cairo, to be forwarded to the Algerian People:

During "Algeria Week" in our country, people from all walks of life in the Chinese capital solemnly convened a rally in Beijing on April 5th to resolutely support the just struggle of the Algerian people against colonialism and for national independence. We extend our highest respect to the heroic Algerian people who are persisting in armed struggle and carrying out a protracted war of resistance.

The Chinese people express their utmost indignation at the colonial war and bloody massacres carried out by French imperialism in Algeria. The Chinese people sternly condemn the French colonialists for stubbornly refusing to end their war of aggression against Algeria and for attempting to continue their colonial rule in Algeria through political conspiracies. American imperialism has been supporting the French imperialists' colonial war of massacring the Algerian people with large quantities of military supplies and loans, and is attempting to replace France in ruling and enslaving the Algerian people. The Chinese people resolutely oppose and condemn this aggressive conspiracy and crime of U.S. imperialism! The French government must immediately end its war of aggression and colonial rule in Algeria, immediately withdraw the French invading troops, and immediately recognize the national independence and sovereignty of the Algerian people. French imperialism and U.S. imperialism must get out of Algeria!

The Algerian people's armed struggle of more than four years has dealt a heavy blow to the French colonialists, powerfully demonstrated the great strength and firm will of the Algerian people in their struggle for national independence, and greatly encouraged the struggle of the African people and all oppressed nations around the world for independence. It has received the sympathy and support of the Asian and African people and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people around the world. We firmly believe that in today's world, with the forces of peace growing stronger and the African people awakening as never before, as long as the Algerian people unite as one and carry the war of liberation to the end, they will surely overthrow the rule of imperialism. Final victory will surely belong to the heroic Algerian people!

The People of All Circles in the Capital of the People's Republic of China Supporting the Algerian People's Struggle for National Independence Rally, April 5, 1959, Beijing

    首都支持阿尔及利亚争取民族独立斗争大会
    致阿尔及利亚人民电开罗阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府转致阿尔及利亚人民：
    中国首都各界人民在我国举行“阿尔及利亚周”的期间，于4月5日在北京隆重集会，坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的正义斗争，并且向坚持武装斗争、进行长期抗战的英雄的阿尔及利亚人民致以最崇高的敬意。
    中国人民对法国帝国主义在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争与血腥屠杀表示极大的愤慨。中国人民严正谴责法国殖民者顽固地拒绝停止对阿尔及利亚的侵略战争和妄图利用政治阴谋继续保持它在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治。美国帝国主义一直以大量军火和贷款支持法帝国主义屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的殖民战争，并且企图代替法国统治和奴役阿尔及利亚人民。中国人民坚决反对和谴责美帝国主义这种侵略阴谋和罪行！法国政府必须立即结束它在阿尔及利亚的侵略战争和殖民统治，立即撤走法国侵略军，立即承认阿尔及利亚人民的民族独立和主权。法帝国主义和美帝国主义必须从阿尔及利亚滚出去！
    阿尔及利亚人民四年多的武装斗争，给予法国殖民者以沉重的打击，有力地显示了阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的伟大力量和坚定意志，大大鼓舞了非洲人民及全世界被压迫民族争取独立的斗争，受到亚非人民和全世界爱好和平与正义的人民的同情和支持。我们深信在和平力量日益强大和非洲人民空前觉醒的今天，只要阿尔及利亚人民团结一致，把解放战争进行到底，就一定能推翻帝国主义的统治。最后胜利必定属于英勇的阿尔及利亚人民！
