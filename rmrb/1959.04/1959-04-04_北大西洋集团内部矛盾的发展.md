    The Development of Internal Contradictions within the North Atlantic Group
    Wang Jin
    For ten years, the United States has used and controlled the North Atlantic aggressive organization. Under the guise of the "communist threat," it has extracted resources from its "allies" with dollars and threatened them with nuclear weapons, binding them to the American war machine, thereby promoting a "position of strength" policy to establish American world hegemony. However, in recent years, on the one hand, the international situation of "the east wind prevailing over the west wind" and, on the other hand, the changes in the balance of power within imperialism have led to a "crisis" in the United States' "leadership position" within the North Atlantic aggressive group. Therefore, while the United States is trying to maintain its increasingly shaky "leadership position" and strengthen its control over Western Europe, the Western European "allies" are trying to break free from American control. This struggle between control and counter-control is becoming increasingly fierce and has become an increasingly serious problem in the current relationship between the United States and its Western European "allies." Recently, the pamphlet printed by the U.S. State Department for the tenth anniversary of the group's establishment also had to admit that the member states of this group have "conflicts of interest." This "conflict" of interests between the member states of the North Atlantic Group is actually a superficial manifestation of the irreconcilable contradictions between imperialist countries.
      New Changes in the Balance of Power
    In the ten years since the war, the role of the inherent objective laws of capitalism has become greater than before the war, and the unbalanced development of capitalism has intensified. All this is concentrated in the new changes in the balance of power within the North Atlantic Group.
      (1) The "leadership position" of the United States in Western Europe has been relatively weakened, while the strength of Western European countries has been relatively enhanced.
    In the early post-war period, Western European countries suffered serious weakening, while the United States once again expanded its economic power in the war, with its industrial and mining production accounting for more than half of the total in the capitalist world. This was the main manifestation of the unbalanced development of capitalism after the end of World War II. At that time, the United States took advantage of the economic difficulties of Western European countries to vigorously expand its power in Western Europe. However, this unbalanced trend has undergone new changes in recent years. This is mainly manifested in the growth of the economic power of Western European countries and the relative weakening of the power of the United States in Western Europe. First of all, looking at the changes in the proportion of various countries in the total industrial production of the capitalist world, the share of the United States in 1937 before the war was 41.4%, and in the early post-war period in 1948, the United States rose to 56.4%, accounting for more than half, while West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium together accounted for only 13.7%. But by 1957, the share of the United States had dropped to 48.6%, the United Kingdom to 8.1%, and the five Western European countries had risen to 20.9% (West Germany accounting for 10.1%, France 5%, Italy 3.6%, the Netherlands 1.1%, Belgium 1%), roughly equal to the share of these five countries in 1937 before the war, 20.9%.
    Looking at trade, in the total value of exports in the capitalist world, the share of the United States in the early post-war period in 1948 reached 24%, the United Kingdom 12.1%, and West Germany, France, and Italy together accounted for only 6.9%. But by 1957, the proportion of the United States in the exports of the capitalist world had dropped to 20.9%, the United Kingdom to 9.4%, and West Germany, France, and Italy accounted for 16.3% (West Germany accounting for 8.7%, France 5.1%, Italy 2.5%, exceeding the proportion of these three countries in 1937 before the war, 12.7%). In addition, the outflow of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in gold in the United States in 1958 benefited other capitalist countries. As a result, Western European countries eliminated the "dollar shortage" within a certain period of time, and their economic position in dealing with the United States was relatively strengthened. This made the Western European "allies" unwilling to be strictly controlled by the United States as they were in the past.
      (2) The bankruptcy of the myth of the United States' "military superiority" and its failure in carrying out aggressive activities around the world have further dealt a blow to the United States' "position of strength."
    When the North Atlantic Group was first established, the U.S. ruling clique妄想(tried in vain) to rely on its then so-called monopoly of atomic weapons to dominate international affairs, and also used this to strengthen its control over its "allies." But soon, the United States' "atomic advantage" burst like a soap bubble. The Soviet Union not only mastered the atomic bomb, but also had the hydrogen bomb. Especially in the past two years, the Soviet Union's great achievements in science and technology, the emergence of intercontinental rockets, artificial satellites, and artificial planets, have changed the balance of power between the two camps. Now no one can deny that the Soviet Union has already gained the advantage in the military field. The emergence of this situation has greatly changed the strategic situation of the North Atlantic Group. The United States is no longer a permanently safe rear. This situation, as pointed out by the broad Western European public opinion, is that the Western European "allies" can no longer rely on the "protection" of the United States, but Western Europe has to "protect" the United States. This, of course, greatly shakes the United States' "leadership position." Eisenhower's speech at the North Atlantic Group's tenth anniversary council meeting the day before yesterday, emphasizing the "unity" and "sacrifice" of the allies, is a clear proof of the United States' "paper tiger" once again.
    After the United States' "position of strength" policy went bankrupt, it suffered continuous failures in its aggressive activities of armed intervention in Lebanon and creating war provocations in the Taiwan Strait region last year. This further reduced the already declining prestige of the United States. And the failure of the United States has created a good opportunity for its "allies" to compete for leadership.
      (3) The change in the balance of power among Western European imperialist countries is beneficial to West Germany, which helps the rise of West German militarism.
    In 1937 before the war, the United Kingdom's industrial production accounted for 12.5% of the total in the capitalist world, while the entire Germany accounted for only 9%. By 1957, the proportion of the United Kingdom had dropped to 8.1%, while West Germany had risen to 10.1%, surpassing the United Kingdom. In 1958, West German industrial production rose by about 2%-3%, while the United Kingdom stagnated for three years and then fell by about 3%. In addition to West Germany, the industrial production of other Western European continental countries has also increased to varying degrees. Looking at foreign trade, West Germany ranked twenty-sixth in the total trade of the capitalist world in 1947, but since 1955, West Germany has surpassed France and ranked third after the United States and the United Kingdom. In the total value of exports of capitalist countries, the proportion of West Germany has risen from 1.1% in 1948 to 8.7% in 1957, while the proportion of the United Kingdom has fallen from 12.1% to 9.4% during the same period. But last year, West Germany surpassed the United Kingdom in the competition for manufactured goods exports, becoming the export country second only to the United States.
    The development of West Germany's economic power and the strong support of the United States have made its political and military status within the imperialist group increasingly strengthened. In Western Europe, West Germany has formed a Bonn-Paris-Rome axis with West Germany as the main force to resist the United Kingdom through various activities to unify Europe, such as organizing the "Coal and Steel Community," the "Common Market," and the German-French-Italian arms alliance. And some countries in the North Atlantic Group that have conflicts with the United Kingdom are also seeking West Germany's support, which makes West Germany's power in Western Europe continue to strengthen, while the United Kingdom is quite isolated. Militarily, West Germany is getting various atomic weapons and missile weapons from the United States. West Germany's Nazi generals are also high in the important position of the Central European Commander of the North Atlantic Group. But West German militarists are not satisfied with this. They are trying to control the navies of the Nordic countries so that West Germany can further enhance its position in the North Atlantic Group.
    The growth of West Germany's economic, political, and military power cannot but sharpen the contradictions within the imperialist group.
      Intensification of Economic Contradictions
    Due to the intensification of the unbalanced development of capitalism, the economic contradictions and struggles between the North Atlantic "allies" are becoming increasingly acute.
    After the war, the emergence of two parallel markets, socialist and capitalist, greatly reduced the capitalist world market. In addition, the United States implemented economic expansion abroad, and the market problems of Western European countries became increasingly serious. At present, due to the development of the capitalist world crisis, this problem has become a life-and-death struggle.
    Since the war, the United States has implemented a "protectionist trade" policy, restricting other countries from exporting to the United States on the one hand, while strengthening its own expansion to other countries. This situation has aroused great dissatisfaction among its "allies." The United Kingdom recently made a tough protest against the United States' trade policy during Macmillan's visit to the United States. And West Germany also restricted the import of American coal due to its own coal industry crisis. This has caused dissatisfaction and opposition from the United States.
    With the support of the United States, West Germany, together with France, Italy, and other six countries, established the Western European "Common Market" to exclude British forces. This is a prominent example in this regard. West Germany, France, and others are planning to build a "Common Market" mainly to create a situation in which West German and French monopoly capital dominate Western Europe and exclude the United Kingdom from the Western European market. Western Europe accounts for a quarter of the United Kingdom's foreign trade, of which the "Common Market" member states account for more than one-eighth. The establishment of the Western European "Common Market" is of course a great threat to the United Kingdom.
    In response to the challenge of the six-nation "Common Market," the United Kingdom proposed the Western European "Free Trade Area for Industrial Products" plan of seventeen Western European countries (including the six countries of the "Common Market"), which aims to disintegrate the "Common Market" and destroy the German-French alliance. To maintain a favorable position for itself in Western Europe and further open up the markets of European countries.
    Due to the intensification of these two contradictions, the long-term negotiations among France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and other countries on the "Common Market" and free trade zone issues have failed to reach any agreement and have ended in failure. Then, in December last year, the pound, franc, and mark all implemented limited free exchange, which led to the collapse of the "Western European Payments Union" and further intensified the Western European economic war. This war is still continuing.
      The Struggle for Leadership
    As early as when the predecessor of the North Atlantic aggressive organization—the Western European Union—was being prepared, the U.S. and British imperialists engaged in open and covert struggles for leadership in Western Europe. Although the United Kingdom's power had been weakened in the war at that time, it never missed an opportunity to try to establish its own military and political sphere of influence. It was for this purpose that the United Kingdom joined forces with four Western European countries to form the Western European Union. Dulles wrote in his book "War or Peace," written less than a year after the establishment of the Western European Union, that "Now the United States is supporting a divided Europe against the Soviet Communists with economic and military assistance, and wants to unite Europe within its own sphere of influence," while "the United Kingdom's policy is to divide Europe so that it can become the core of the balance of power." From Dulles' words, it is not difficult to understand that the Western European Union initially had a side to prevent the expansion of American power in Western Europe.
    However, at that time, the scope of this struggle for power and profit was relatively small, only between the United Kingdom and the United States. And because of the weakening of the United Kingdom's power after the war, this attempt to seize leadership was easily suppressed by the United States. But now, when the United States' "position of strength" has gone bankrupt, the myth of military superiority has begun to collapse, and its aggressive activities around the world have failed, while the strength of Western European countries has been relatively enhanced, the contradiction within the imperialist group of competing for leadership is becoming more and more extensive and acute.
    After the United Kingdom proposed the principle of "mutual dependence" in 1957 when the United States was in an unprecedentedly difficult situation, the United Kingdom's ambition to seize leadership has become increasingly fierce. In October last year, British Marshal Montgomery, the retired Deputy Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group, publicly criticized the United Kingdom for handing over leadership to the United States after the war. And recently, this marshal published an article demanding a change in the situation in which everything is led by the United States, and that the United Kingdom should stand up. At present, the United Kingdom is also taking advantage of the United States' predicament in the Berlin and German issues, Dulles' illness, and Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union, to seize the "leadership responsibility" of the Western world. All this has greatly annoyed the United States. American newspapers and congressmen openly attacked Macmillan for being unworthy of being a "leader"; they also ridiculed that the role of the protagonist is "determined by the facts of strength" (U.S. "Business Week"). Now this struggle is still in full swing.
    West Germany and France are also waiting for an opportunity to rise. At the 1957 North Atlantic Group Paris meeting, West Germany, France, and others were extremely indignant at the so-called "mutual dependence" under the U.S.-British alliance dominating the North Atlantic Group. At that time, West Germany united with France and Italy to form a continental front to confront the United States and the United Kingdom. They also opposed the United States' arbitrary behavior in the name of "strengthening consultations." Soon after, de Gaulle came to power. He took advantage of the dissatisfaction of the Western European continent with the United States and the United Kingdom, and proposed the establishment of a "three-headed core" of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, to share leadership equally with the United States and the United Kingdom. De Gaulle's approach once shocked the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the United States and the United Kingdom estimated that de Gaulle's strength was not strong, and they have always been lukewarm to de Gaulle's "three-headed core." So de Gaulle, on the one hand, stepped up collusion with West Germany to form a French-German axis to confront the United States and the United Kingdom, and on the other hand, decided to manage the French fleet in the Mediterranean Sea by itself, instead of handing it over to the American and British generals of the North Atlantic Group for command, to dismantle the North Atlantic Group. De Gaulle's decision has made the United States extremely worried. They are deeply afraid that other countries will follow suit, leading to the collapse of this aggressive group.
    West Germany is also dissatisfied with France's attempt to seize leadership. But its main goal is to compete with the United Kingdom for the second seat. Although West Germany can duel with the United Kingdom in terms of economic strength and political status within the Atlantic Group, the United Kingdom's favorable position and West Germany's isolated situation on the Berlin issue and the German issue currently allow the United Kingdom to exert pressure on West Germany on this issue. Therefore, West Germany is trying to win over France to jointly resist the United Kingdom. In response to the United Kingdom's attempt to become the leader of the Western world, France and Germany publicly stated: "The (West) German and French partners in the Western alliance do not intend to accept British Prime Minister Macmillan replacing Dulles to lead." Although Macmillan recently visited Paris and Bonn, saying that everyone has reached a consensus. In fact, the unease that West Germany and France feel about the United Kingdom "has not completely disappeared." According to reports, Adenauer is particularly opposed to Macmillan's recently proposed plan to "freeze" armaments. The U.S. "New York Herald Tribune" said: "In Adenauer's view, this is equivalent to lowering West Germany's status and placing it in the second rank in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." According to the "New York Times," Adenauer also said: "These British! They should know that they can no longer play a leading role on the European continent."
    This intricate struggle for leadership within the North Atlantic Group is deepening the trend of disintegration of this aggressive group. The so-called "Atlantic solidarity" is just a lie.
    The Development of Contradictions in the Military Field
    It is worth noting that the contradictions within the North Atlantic Group are not limited to the political and economic fields, but also in the military field, contradictions are also expanding and developing.
    For a long time, the "peripheral strategy" formulated by the United States for the North Atlantic Group has been completely bankrupt due to the advantages of Soviet military science and missile technology. In order to save its military decline, the U.S. ruling clique once proposed a plan to set up medium-range missile bases in Western Europe to surround the Soviet Union and disperse the strikes against the U.S. mainland. But it has been several years since the United States proposed this plan, but it has not achieved its original purpose. Some Nordic countries in the North Atlantic Group, Denmark and Norway, publicly refused the United States to set up medium-range missile bases on their territory because they were worried that the United States' plan would cause serious consequences. And France has been deliberately making things difficult, requiring France to control the missiles itself as a condition, and using this as capital for France to enter the leadership core of the North Atlantic Group and bargain with the United States. Therefore, so far, only the United Kingdom, Italy, and other countries have agreed to the United States setting up medium-range missile bases. However, the people of France, Italy, and other countries are launching a movement against setting up missile bases to force their governments to cancel this agreement that will bring serious disasters.
    On the other hand, not only have the U.S.'s proposed military expansion plans over the years failed to be completed year after year, but also countries have become increasingly independent. Some small countries have shortened the term of military service against the advice of the North Atlantic Supreme Command. France not only withdrew the command of the Mediterranean fleet, but also refused to merge its tactical air force by the North Atlantic Group. And de Gaulle also openly stated that he "hopes to completely change the laborious approach of merging the allied forces, and establish a new cooperation system on a country-by-country basis." At the same time, British Marshal Montgomery also accused the North Atlantic "strategic plan of being chaotic" and the military headquarters of being "cumbersome, bulky, and full of redundant personnel." He even demanded that the North Atlantic Group's forces be commanded by their own countries. This view was echoed by almost all Western European countries.
    Facts have proved that the trend of the North Atlantic Group gradually moving towards disintegration is strengthening. The so-called "Atlantic solidarity" is just a lie.

    北大西洋集团内部矛盾的发展
    王进
    十年来，美国利用和控制北大西洋侵略组织，在“共产主义威胁”的幌子下，一手拿美元榨取“盟国”，一手拿核弹恐吓“盟国”，把它们束缚在美国的战车上，从而推行为美国树立世界霸权的“实力地位”政策。但是，近年来，一方面，由于东风劲吹西风益衰的国际形势；另一方面，由于帝国主义内部力量对比所起的变化，使得美国在北大西洋侵略集团内的
  “领导地位”已发生了“危机”。因之，在美国力图继续保持自己日益动摇的“领导地位”而加强控制西欧的同时，西欧“盟国”则竭力想摆脱美国的控制。这种控制和反控制的斗争愈来愈剧烈，已成为当前美国同西欧“盟国”关系中日益严重的问题。最近，美国国务院为这集团成立十周年编印的小册子，也不得不承认这个集团的成员国“在利害关系上发生的冲突”。北大西洋集团成员国间利害关系的这种“冲突”，实际上是帝国主义国家间的不可调和的矛盾的表面化。
      力量对比的新变化
    战后十年来，资本主义内在的客观规律所起的作用比战前更大了，资本主义经济发展不平衡性加强了，这一切集中表现在北大西洋集团内部力量对比的新的变化上。
      （一）美国在西欧的“领导地位”相对削弱，西欧国家的力量则相对增强。
    战后初期，西欧国家遭到了严重的削弱，而美国则在战争中又一次扩张了它的经济力量，其工矿生产占资本主义世界总额的一半以上。这是二次大战结束后，资本主义经济发展不平衡的主要表现。当时美国利用西欧国家的经济困难，竭力扩张它在西欧的势力。但是这种不平衡的趋势近年来又发生了新的变化。这主要表现在西欧国家经济力量的增长，以及美国在西欧力量的相对削弱上。首先，从资本主义世界工业生产总额中各国比重的变化来看，战前1937年美国所占的份额为41.4％，战后初期1948年美国上升到56.4％，占一半以上，而西德、法、意、荷、比五国加在一起仅占13.7％。但到1957年，美国所占份额即下降到48.6％，英国降到8.1％，而西欧五国则上升到20.9％（西德占10.1％，法5％，意3.6％，荷1.1％，比1％），已同战前1937年这五国所占份额20.9％大致相等。
    再从贸易方面来看，在资本主义世界出口总值中，战后初期1948年美国所占分额达24％，英国占12.1％，西德、法、意三国合在一起仅占6.9％。但到1957年，美国在资本主义世界出口中的比重则下降到20.9％，英国降到9.4％，而西德、法、意三国则占16.3％（西德占8.7％，法5.1％，意2.5％，已超过三国在战前1937年所占比重12.7％）。加上美国1958年二十四亿美元的黄金外流，使其他资本主义国家得到了好处。结果，西欧国家在一定时期内消除了“美元荒”，它们同美国打交道的经济地位相对加强了。这就使西欧“盟国”不愿再像过去那样受美国的严格控制了。
      （二）美国“军事优势”神话的破产，以及它在全世界进行侵略活动的失败，进一步使美国的“实力地位”遭到打击。
    北大西洋集团在它刚成立时，美国统治集团妄想依靠它当时的所谓原子武器方面的垄断地位在国际事务中称王称霸，同时也借此来加强对它的“盟国”的控制。但是不久，美国的“原子优势”像肥皂泡那样破灭了，苏联不仅同样掌握了原子弹，而且还有氢弹。特别近两年来苏联科学技术上的巨大成就，洲际火箭和人造卫星以及人造行星的出现，更改变了两个阵营力量的对比。现在已经没有人能否认苏联在军事方面已经占优势了。这种情况的出现大大改变了北大西洋集团的战略形势。美国已经不是永远安全的后方了。这种形势，正像广大西欧舆论所指出，现在西欧“盟国”已经不能依托美国的“保护”，而倒是要西欧来“保护”美国了。这当然使美国的“领导地位”大大动摇。艾森豪威尔前天在北大西洋集团十周年理事会会议上的演说中着重要盟国“团结”和“牺牲”，即为美国“纸老虎”又一次表现的明证。
    美国在它的“实力地位”政策破产之后，又在去年对黎巴嫩的武装干涉和在台湾海峡地区制造战争挑衅的侵略活动中，连续遭到失败。这就使原已衰落了的美国的威信进一步降低了。而美国的失败给它的“盟国”造成了一个争夺领导权的大好机会。
      （三）西欧帝国主义国家间的力量对比发生了有利于西德的变化，有助于西德军国主义的崛起。
    战前1937年，英国的工业生产占资本主义世界总额的12.5％，而当时整个德国仅占9％。到1957年，英国所占的比重下降到8.1％，而西德则上升到10.1％，已凌驾于英国之上。1958年西德工业生产上升约2％—3％，而英国则在停滞三年后又下降约3％。除西德外，其他西欧大陆国家的工业生产也有不同程度的增长。再从对外贸易方面来看，1947年西德在资本主义世界贸易总额中居第二十六位，但自1955年开始，西德已超过法国而居美英之后名列第三。在资本主义国家出口总额中，西德所占比重，已经从1948年的1.1％上升到1957年的8.7％，而同期英国的比重则从12.1％下降到9.4％。但到了去年，西德更在制成品出口竞争中赶过了英国，成为仅次于美国的出口国家。
    西德经济力量的发展和美国的大力扶植，使它在帝国主义集团内的政治和军事上的地位也越来越加强。在西欧，西德通过各种统一欧洲的活动，如组织“煤钢联营”、“共同市场”以及德、法、意三国军火同盟等等形成了一个以西德为主力的反抗英国的波恩—巴黎—罗马轴心。而北大西洋集团内一些和英国冲突的国家也纷纷寻求西德的支持，这就使西德在西欧的力量不断加强，而英国却相当孤立。在军事上，西德正在从美国手里得到各种原子武器和导弹武器。西德的纳粹将军也高踞北大西洋集团中欧司令的要津。但是西德军国主义者并不以此为满足，他们正在企图控制北欧国家的海军，以便使西德能在北大西洋集团中的地位更为增强。
    西德在经济、政治、军事力量方面的增长不能不使帝国主义集团内部的矛盾尖锐化。
      经济矛盾尖锐化
    由于资本主义发展不平衡性的加强，北大西洋“盟国”之间的经济矛盾和斗争越来越尖锐。
    战后，社会主义和资本主义两个平行市场的出现，使资本主义世界市场大大缩小，加上美国对外实行经济扩张，西欧国家的市场问题日益严重起来。目前由于资本主义世界性危机的发展，这个问题更成为一场你死我活的斗争。
    战后以来，美国实行“保护贸易”政策，一方面限制别国向美国输出，同时却加强自己向别国的扩张。这种情况已经引起它的“盟国”的极大的不满。英国最近在麦克米伦访美时公开对美国的这种贸易政策提出强硬的抗议。而西德也由于本国的煤业危机而限制美国煤的进口。这已引起美国的不满和反对。
    在美国支持下，西德联合法、意等六国，建立西欧“共同市场”，来排挤英国势力，是这方面一个突出的例子，西德、法国等筹建
  “共同市场”主要是造成西德、法国垄断资本称霸西欧的局面；并把英国排挤出西欧市场。而西欧在英国对外贸易额中占四分之一，其中“共同市场”成员国占八分之一以上，西欧“共同市场”的成立对英国当然是一个很大的威胁。
    英国针对六国“共同市场”的挑战，提出了西欧十七国（包括上“共同市场”六国在内）的西欧“工业品自由贸易区”计划，其目的在于瓦解“共同市场”，破坏德、法联盟。使自己在西欧保有一个有利的地位，并进一步打开欧洲各国的市场。
    由于这两方面矛盾的尖锐化，长期来法、德、英等国家围绕着“共同市场”和自由贸易区问题进行的谈判，不能达成任何协议而以破裂告终。接着去年12月英镑、法郎、马克都实行有限度自由兑换，使“西欧支付同盟”宣告垮台，更加剧了西欧的经济战。这场战争至今还在继续。
      争夺领导权的斗争
    早在北大西洋侵略组织的前身——西欧联盟筹组的时候，美、英帝国主义就为争夺西欧领导权进行了明争暗斗。尽管当时英国力量已在战争中遭到削弱，但它从不放过机会试图建立自己的军事、政治势力范围。正是在这种目的下，英国联合西欧四国组成了西欧联盟。杜勒斯在西欧联盟成立后不到一年写成的“战争或和平”一书中说过这样的话：“现在美国正以经济和军事的援助，支持一个分裂的欧洲对抗苏联共产党，要把欧洲统一在自己势力范围内”的时候，而“英国的政策是使欧洲分裂，从而使它自己成为均衡势力的核心”。从杜勒斯的话听来，不难了解西欧联盟当初有着防止美国势力在西欧扩张的一面的。
    但是当时这种争权夺利的斗争范围比较小，只在英美之间。而且由于战后英国势力的削弱，这种争夺领导权的企图很容易就给美国压下去了。但是现在，当美国“实力地位”陷于破产，军事优势神话开始破灭，以及它在全世界侵略活动的失败，而西欧国家力量相对增强时，帝国主义集团内部争夺领导权的矛盾是越来越广泛，越来越尖锐了。
    英国在1957年乘美国处境空前困难时提出“相互依赖”的原则之后，英国争夺领导权的野心越来越厉害了。去年10月，英国元帅、已退职的北大西洋集团最高副司令蒙哥马利公开抨击英国战后把领导权交给美国。而最近这位元帅更发表文章，要求改变一切由美国领导的这种局面，而要英国站出来。目前，英国也正在利用美国在柏林和德国问题上的困境和杜勒斯的病倒以及麦克米伦的访苏，乘机要夺取西方世界的“领导责任”。这一切曾经使美国大为恼火。美国报纸和议员公开攻击麦克米伦不配当“领导人”；还奚落地说，要担任主角是“由实力的事实决定的”（美“商业周刊”）。现在这一场斗争还正方兴未艾。
    西德和法国也在伺机而起。1957年北大西洋集团巴黎会议时，西德、法国等都对所谓“相互依赖”下的美英联盟独霸北大西洋集团的做法极为愤慨。西德当时联合法、意组成大陆阵线来对抗美英。他们还以“加强磋商”为名，反对美国的独断独行。不久之后，戴高乐上台，他利用西欧大陆对美英不满的情绪，提出了建立美、英、法“三巨头核心”，要跟美英平分领导权。戴高乐的这种做法曾经引起美英的震动。但是美、英估计到戴高乐力量不强，对戴高乐的这个“三巨头核心”一直表示冷淡。于是戴高乐一方面加紧同西德勾结，组成法—德轴心来对抗美英，另一方面又决定把法国在地中海的舰队自行管理，而不交给北大西洋集团的美英将军们指挥，来拆北大西洋集团的台。戴高乐的这一决定使美国极为担忧。他们深怕其他国家起而效法，导致这个侵略集团的垮台。
    西德对法国这种想争领导权的企图也是不满的。但是它的主要目标是跟英国争夺第二把交椅。西德在经济方面和大西洋集团内的政治地位上虽然可以和英国决斗，但是目前在柏林问题和德国问题上英国的有利地位和西德的孤立处境，使英国能够在这个问题上向西德施加压力。因此西德就竭力拉拢法国来共同抵制英国。针对英国想当西方世界领导的企图，法、德两国公开表示：“西方联盟中（西）德、法两国伙伴不打算接受由英国首相麦克米伦代替杜勒斯来进行领导”。虽然不久前麦克米伦曾经走访了巴黎和波恩，说什么大家已取得一致意见。实际上，西德和法国对英国感到的不安“还没有完全消失。”有消息说，阿登纳特别反对麦克米伦最近提出的“冻结”军备的计划。美国“纽约先驱论坛报”说：“在阿登纳看来，这等于降低西德的身份，使它在北大西洋公约组织中居于第二流”。据“纽约时报”报道，阿登纳还说了这样的话：“这些英国人！他们应该知道，他们再也不能在欧洲大陆起领导作用了”。
    北大西洋集团内部这种错综复杂的争夺领导权的斗争正在加深这个侵略集团分崩离析的趋势。
    军事上矛盾的发展
    值得注意的是：北大西洋集团的矛盾不仅限于政治和经济方面，而且在军事方面矛盾也在扩大和发展。
    长期来美国所制订的北大西洋集团的“外围战略”由于苏联军事科学和导弹技术的优势而完全破产。为了挽救它在军事上的颓势，美国统治集团曾经提出要在西欧设立中程导弹基地的计划，来包围苏联，并分散对美国本土的打击。但是从美国提出这个计划以来已经好几年了，但一直没有达到原定的目的。北大西洋集团内一些北欧国家丹麦、挪威由于担心美国这项计划将会造成严重的后果，因而公开拒绝美国在他们领土上设置中程导弹基地。而法国一直故意刁难，要由法国自己来控制导弹为条件，并且以此作为让法国打入北大西洋集团领导核心和美国讨价还价的资本。因此到现在为止，只有英国、意大利等几个国家同意美国设置中程导弹基地。但是法、意等国人民正在掀起反对设置导弹基地的运动，以迫使本国政府取消这种会带来严重灾难的协定。
    另一方面不但美国历年提出的扩军计划一年又一年地不能完成，而且各国越来越自行其是。一些小国不听北大西洋最高司令部的意见缩短了兵役期。法国则收回地中海舰队指挥权不算，还曾拒绝由北大西洋集团合并它的战术空军。并且戴高乐还公开表示“希望完全改变想把盟国军队合并起来的吃力的作法，而在一国一国的基础上建立新的合作制度”。与此同时，英国元帅蒙哥马利也指责北大西洋“战略计划紊乱”，军事总部是“庞杂的、笨重的、充满冗员的”机构。他甚至也要求让北大西洋集团军队由各国自己统率。这种看法得到几乎所有西欧国家的响应。
    事实证明，北大西洋集团逐步走向四分五裂的趋势正在加强。所谓“大西洋团结”只是一句谎话。
