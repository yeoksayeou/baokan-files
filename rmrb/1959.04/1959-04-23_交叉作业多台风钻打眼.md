    Cross-Operation with Multiple Pneumatic Drills for Hole Drilling
    The workers of the Third Shaft Construction Engineering Office of Shuanghe in Sichuan Province, at the Shuanghe No. 1 Inclined Shaft, created a record of advancing 202 meters in the main shaft in a month, an increase of nearly double compared to the 110 meters advanced in the previous month.
    Based on the hardness of the rock strata, they frequently revised the borehole layout diagram and the cyclical operation chart, implemented regular multi-cycle operations (four to sixteen cycles per day and night), parallel cross-operations of multiple processes, and used multiple pneumatic drills for hole drilling, shortening the time of each cycle to achieve the goal of more footage. They adopted the multi-skip rapid rock loading method, shortening the time required to load one cart from ten minutes to one to two minutes. The use of throw-blasting methods allowed the collapsed rock to be thrown far away from the working face, creating conditions for parallel operation of multiple processes and accelerating progress.

    交叉作业多台风钻打眼
    四川双河第三建井工程处的职工，在双河一号斜井，创造了主井月进二百零二公尺的纪录，比前月进一百一十公尺，提高近一倍。
    他们根据岩层软硬情况，经常修改炮眼布置图和循环作业图表，实行正规多循环作业（每昼夜四至十六个循环），多工序平行交叉作业，多台风钻打眼，缩短每个循环的时间，达到多进尺的目的。他们采用多箕快速装岩法，由过去每装一车需十分钟缩短到一至两分钟。采用抛碴爆破法，使崩下的岩石远抛出工作面，给多工序平行作业创造了条件，加速了进度。
