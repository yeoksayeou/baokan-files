Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, delivered a speech at the Commemoration of the Fourth Anniversary of the Bandung Conference. The full text is as follows:

    Comrades, Friends: Today is the fourth anniversary of the Bandung Conference. We, the people of all circles in the capital, are gathered here solemnly to warmly celebrate this glorious festival of the Asian and African people, and feel extremely excited and encouraged.

    Four years ago, the conference held in Bandung had great historical significance. At this conference, leaders and politicians from twenty-nine Asian and African countries gathered together, representing the will of 1.6 billion Asian and African people, and freely and fully discussed the common issues that concerned them most. It was a grand meeting of great unity among the Asian and African people. The resolutions passed at the conference were a solemn condemnation of the scourge of colonialism. The Bandung spirit of peace, independence, and friendship, and the Ten Principles, have become increasingly popular, greatly inspiring and promoting the struggle of the Asian and African people against imperialism and colonialism, and advancing the Asian and African national independence movement to an unprecedentedly high stage.

    Over the past four years, the seeds sown by the Bandung Conference have blossomed and borne fruit everywhere in the vast lands of Asia and Africa. We are pleased to see that many Asian and African countries that have already achieved independence have achieved a series of victories in their struggle to safeguard national independence and adhere to peaceful neutrality. The Indonesian people have resolutely suppressed the armed rebellion instigated and supported by US imperialism, and the Cambodian people have continuously defeated foreign aggression and subversion. The Egyptian people, in their struggle to recover the Suez Canal, repelled the armed attacks of British, French, and Israeli imperialism. The Syrian people crushed the US imperialist military threats and subversive conspiracies. With the unanimous support of peace-loving countries and people around the world, the Arab people forced US and British imperialism to withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The Omani people are bravely resisting British imperialist aggression. Particularly commendable is the revolutionary victory of the Iraqi people. This victory dealt a heavy blow to the US and British imperialist aggressive plans in Asia and Africa, and set a good example for the Asian and African national independence movement. Now, after crushing three subversive conspiracies by imperialists and domestic and foreign reactionaries, the Iraqi people are advancing along the path of democracy and national revolution. Over this period, new independent Asian and African countries have emerged one after another. The people of Malaya, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, and Guinea have successively become masters of their own countries. After a long and arduous armed struggle, the Algerian people finally established a provisional government of the republic and are persevering in a heroic national liberation war. We are particularly excited to see that recently, the national independence movement in sub-Saharan Africa has developed vigorously. Imperialism has been forced to agree to the independence of Nigeria, Togo, Cameroon, and Somaliland in 1960. The Congo, which has always been regarded by colonialists as an "oasis of stability," has ignited the flames of anti-colonialism. The national independence movements in Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, and other parts of Africa are also surging, shaking the imperialist colonial rule in Africa. The great African people have awakened, and the day is not far off when they will all become masters of the African continent.

    This series of victories achieved by the Asian and African people in their national liberation struggles has accelerated the disintegration of the imperialist colonial system, frustrated imperialist aggression and expansion in Asia and Africa, and disrupted imperialist plans to prepare for a new war. We are pleased to see that more and more independent Asian and African countries are pursuing a policy of peaceful neutrality, the Asian and African peace zone is constantly expanding, and Asian and African countries are playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. Under the resolute blows of the Asian and African people, the military blocs painstakingly pieced together by imperialism for many years are crumbling. The Baghdad Pact has virtually gone bankrupt, and the Manila Treaty is becoming increasingly ineffective. Although US imperialism has adopted the method of launching military coups to strengthen its control over its puppet states, the contradictions between the United States and these countries are becoming increasingly acute. The struggle of the people of these countries against the establishment and expansion of military bases by the United States, against the testing and transportation of nuclear weapons by the United States, against their own governments' pursuit of the US policy of arms expansion and war preparation, and demanding a path of peaceful neutrality is intensifying. In particular, the Japanese people, who have experienced the disasters of atomic weapons, have carried out an unyielding struggle for independence, peace, and democracy over the past few years. At present, the Japanese people are launching an unprecedented mass movement against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty," against arming the Japanese army with nuclear weapons, and demanding the implementation of a neutral policy. This struggle of the Japanese people seriously hinders the US conspiracy to use Japan to expand aggression and prepare for a new war in the Far East.

    Over the past four years, Asian and African national independent countries have also made remarkable achievements in developing their national economies. The people of Asian and African countries, who have suffered deeply from imperialist exploitation and oppression, know that there can be no complete national independence without economic independence. In order to consolidate independence and eliminate the poverty and backwardness caused by long-term colonial rule, the people and leaders of Asian and African countries have made various efforts to explore a path for developing their national economies. We are pleased to see that some countries are effectively implementing long-term economic construction plans, some countries are gradually developing their own resources and establishing their own factories and mines, and some countries are trying to improve agricultural cultivation. The great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural construction and the construction achievements of all other Asian and African countries have powerfully refuted the imperialist fallacy that backward countries are incapable of carrying out economic construction, limited and struck at imperialist economic expansion, and enhanced the confidence of Asian and African countries in striving for economic independence. Although imperialism is still attempting to exploit the economic difficulties of some Asian and African countries, use so-called aid to shift the crisis, and control these countries economically and politically, the people of Asian and African countries who have already won political independence will certainly be able to rely on their own efforts and mutual support to get rid of imperialist economic control and gradually embark on the road of independent development.

    With the vigorous development of the Asian and African national independence movement, mutual support and friendly cooperation among the people of Asian and African countries in their common struggle are also constantly strengthening. Over the past four years, there have been extensive contacts among leaders of various countries, and trade and cultural exchanges among countries have developed rapidly. Following the Bandung Conference, a series of important conferences were held in the Asian and African region, such as the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, the Conference of Independent African States, the Asian-African Economic Conference, the All-African People's Conference, and the Asian-African Student, Women, and Writers Conferences, etc. These conferences have played a significant role in promoting mutual understanding and friendly unity among the Asian and African people. The unity and cooperation of the Asian and African people have greatly encouraged and promoted the struggle of the Asian and African people to win and safeguard national independence.

    Comrades, Friends! The upsurge of the national independence movement is an important characteristic of our era, and this characteristic is manifested not only in Asia and Africa but also in Latin America. The great Bandung spirit has long surpassed regional boundaries and has had an increasingly profound influence on the world, especially on Latin America. In recent years, the Latin American people have achieved a series of major victories in their struggle against US control, safeguarding national independence, and striving for democratic freedom. The dictatorial regimes fostered by the United States in Latin America have collapsed one after another, and the reputation of the United States in Latin America is becoming increasingly odious. Particularly encouraging is that the heroic Cuban people, right next to the United States, do not take US warships, atomic bombs, or hydrogen bombs seriously, dare to use armed struggle to overthrow the reactionary pro-US government, and have resolutely resisted US interference. This shows that the struggle of the Latin American people is in full swing. These victories of the Latin American people cannot but have a great encouragement and influence on the national liberation struggles of the Asian and African people.

    The unprecedentedly high tide of the Asian and African national independence movement that has emerged since the Bandung Conference is inseparable from the general international situation in which the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, and especially from the strong support of socialist countries for the national independence movement. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has always regarded supporting the national independence movement as its sacred duty. Whenever the Asian and African national independence movement is at a critical juncture, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries always provide timely and strong support. This has been most conclusively proven when Britain and France launched a war of aggression against Egypt, when the United States threatened Syria with war, and when the United States and Britain launched armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan and attempted to attack the newborn Iraq. In addition, the Indonesian people, the Algerian people, the Omani people, and other Asian and African people have all received enthusiastic support from socialist countries in their struggle against imperialist aggression. In order to help Asian and African countries develop their own national economies, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have also provided economic and technical assistance to many Asian and African national independent countries without any conditions attached. Everyone knows that when imperialism imposed an economic blockade on Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries, it was the Soviet Union and other socialist countries that helped them break through this blockade. When imperialism used the revocation of loans to exert economic pressure on the United Arab Republic, it was the Soviet Union that provided the United Arab Republic with a low-interest loan of 700 million rubles and used a loan of 400 million rubles to help the United Arab Republic design and build the first phase of the Aswan Dam project. These facts, and many other facts, have repeatedly proven that the socialist camp is the most loyal and reliable friend of the Asian and African people in their struggle for national liberation.

    China is a participating country in the Bandung Conference and the initiator of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese people and the people of other Asian and African countries have a common experience of suffering from colonial oppression for a long time. Now, imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan and is stepping up the creation of "two Chinas" in an attempt to achieve its goal of permanently occupying Taiwan. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people are carrying out the struggle to liberate Taiwan and oppose the US imperialist creation of "two Chinas." Therefore, the Chinese people and the people of Asian and African countries naturally have a desire for deep sympathy and mutual support. Over the past four years, our people have established increasingly close ties with the Asian and African national independence movement, and the friendly and cooperative relations between our country and Asian and African countries have been further consolidated and developed. Our people have given as much support as possible to every just struggle of the Asian and African people to win and safeguard national independence. At the same time, the people of Asian and African countries have also powerfully supported our people's struggle against US aggression, safeguarding national sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This mutual support in the common struggle has further tested and developed our friendship and unity.

    Comrades, Friends! While we hail the great victory of the Asian and African national independence movement, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the new aggressive conspiracies of imperialism. The imperialist colonial forces will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. The greater our victory, the more frightened imperialism will be. The closer they are to death, the more they will carry out a dying struggle. In particular, the most ferocious enemy of the Asian and African people, US imperialism, is doing everything possible to launch a counterattack. In addition to directly carrying out military threats and armed suppression, the United States is also piecing together military blocs, concluding military treaties, instigating military coups, and organizing subversive activities. Recently, the United States signed bilateral military treaties with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, attempting to use this to replace the Baghdad Pact Group, which has virtually gone bankrupt, and instigate new aggression and subversive activities against the Middle East. The United States has also recently coerced and colluded with the reactionaries of some Southeast Asian countries, taking a series of actions that endanger the peace and security of Southeast Asia. The United States blatantly violates the Geneva Accords, attempting to pull Laos into the Manila Aggression Group and turn Laos into a US military base. The United States instigated the Ngo Dinh Diem clique of South Vietnam to invade our Xisha Islands, endangering the security of other neighboring countries. The United States is also instigating Thailand and South Vietnam to carry out subversion against Cambodia, attempting to undermine Cambodia's independence and neutral status. Recently, US imperialism, through the Manila Treaty Group Council meeting held in Wellington, planned aggressive conspiracies and subversive activities against Southeast Asian countries. This series of aggressive acts and conspiracies of imperialism, especially US imperialism, in the Asian and African region, shows that the struggle of the Asian and African people against imperialism and colonialism is still a serious task. However, just when the Asian and African people are doubly vigilant and continuing to wage a resolute struggle against imperialism, some politicians in certain Asian and African countries actually believe that the anti-imperialist task has ended and that the spearhead of the struggle can be directed at the people. This is exactly what imperialism wants. We hope that they can recognize the anti-imperialist goal and continue to stand with the people to complete the great cause of opposing imperialism and colonialism. If they insist on abandoning the anti-imperialist banner, they will certainly be spurned by the people.

    Comrades, Friends! The four years of history since the Bandung Conference fully prove that the internal unity of Asian and African countries, the unity among Asian and African countries, and the unity between Asian and African countries and socialist countries are the fundamental guarantees for the Asian and African people to win and safeguard national independence, and a serious obstacle to imperialist aggression and expansion in the Asian and African region. Therefore, imperialism is extremely hostile to this unity and has never given up every opportunity to undermine it. Recently, imperialism, especially US imperialism, after its open aggression and interference suffered a series of failures, is resorting to more insidious methods, sowing discord, spreading disunity, and attempting to split Asian and African unity from within and undermine the Asian and African national independence movement. It is especially worth noting that US imperialism is taking advantage of certain difficulties and complex situations that have emerged in the Arab national independence movement, attempting to instigate Arabs to fight Arabs and stir up a counter-current of anti-Sovietism and anti-communism, in order to realize its new aggressive and subversive conspiracies against Arab countries. And modern revisionists are willingly serving as servants of US imperialism, working to achieve this conspiracy. However, this conspiracy has been exposed by more and more Arab people. Recently, US imperialism and its servants—modern revisionists and certain pro-US reactionary forces in Asian and African countries—have again been using the Tibet issue to clamor loudly, slandering our country's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as aggression and expansion, and as a violation of the Five Principles, attempting to stir up a counter-current of opposition to China and destruction of the Five Principles, and to provoke our country's friendly relations with India and Southeast Asian countries. However, this despicable trick of imperialism and foreign reactionaries cannot deceive the eyes and ears of the Asian and African people either. Everyone knows that Tibet has been Chinese territory since the 13th century. The Chinese people's suppression of the rebellion in their own territory is purely China's internal affair, and no one can interfere in any form. Recently, the broad masses of the Indian people and fair public opinion have clearly stated that they resolutely oppose any actions that harm Sino-Indian friendship on the Tibet issue and demand vigilance against imperialist provocation. This is a welcome and friendly attitude. However, a few expansionist elements in India, and even some Indian politicians, disregard the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, and openly support the Tibetan armed rebellion, interfere in China's internal affairs, and attempt to separate Tibet from China. This is completely inheriting the mantle of British imperialism. Such a conspiracy is doomed to failure. In today's era, anyone who caters to the will of imperialism, deviates from the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, deviates from the Bandung spirit, and engages in activities that are detrimental to Asian and African unity will never have a good end.

    Comrades, Friends! The Bandung spirit, which is unanimously supported by peace-loving people of all countries in the world, has become the mainstream of the Asian and African people's advance in political life, and this can never be blocked by a handful of imperialists and reactionaries. Their frantic clamor does not indicate their strength, but precisely indicates their panic. The situation is favorable to the people and unfavorable to imperialism and all reactionaries. Premier Zhou Enlai said at the Bandung Conference four years ago: "If we are determined to safeguard world peace, no one can drag us into war; if we are determined to strive for and safeguard national independence, no one can continue to enslave us; if we are determined to cooperate in a friendly manner, no one can divide us." This remains our guiding principle today. The Bandung spirit is invincible. The Chinese people will always unite with the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, hold high the banner of the Bandung Conference, and fight to the end for the realization of peaceful coexistence and for the complete victory of the struggle against imperialism and colonialism!

    Long live the Bandung spirit!
    Long live the great unity of the Asian and African people!
    Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
    Long live world peace!

    背离万隆精神干涉我国内政定遭失败
    郭沫若在首都纪念万隆会议大会上的讲话全文
    新华社23日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在纪念万隆会议四周年大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    同志们，朋友们：今天是万隆会议四周年。我们首都各界人民在此隆重集会，热烈庆祝亚非人民的这个光辉节日，感到无比的兴奋和鼓舞。
    四年前，在万隆召开的这次会议，有着重大的历史意义。在这次会议上，二十九个亚非国家的领导人和政治家聚集一堂，代表着十六亿亚非人民的意志，自由和充分地讨论了他们最关心的共同的问题。这是一次亚非人民大团结的大会。会议所通过的决议，是对殖民主义祸害的严正谴责。和平、独立、友好的万隆精神和十项原则越来越深入人心，大大地鼓舞和推动了亚非人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的斗争，使亚非民族独立运动进入了一个空前高涨的阶段。
    四年来，万隆会议播下的种子，已经在亚非广阔的土地上到处开花结果。我们高兴地看到许多已经取得独立的亚非国家，在维护民族独立、坚持和平中立的斗争中，取得了一系列的胜利。印度尼西亚人民坚决地镇压了美帝国主义煽动和支持的武装叛乱，柬埔寨人民不断击败了外来的侵略和颠复活动。埃及人民在收回苏伊士运河的斗争中，击退了英法帝国主义和以色列的武装进攻，叙利亚人民粉碎了美帝国主义的武力威胁和颠复阴谋。阿拉伯人民在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的一致支持下，迫使美英帝国主义从黎巴嫩和约旦撤走了他们的侵略军队。阿曼人民正在英勇地抗击着英帝国主义的侵略。特别值得称道的是伊拉克人民的革命胜利。这个胜利沉重地打击了美英帝国主义在亚非地区的侵略计划，为亚非民族独立运动树立了很好的榜样。现在，伊拉克人民在粉碎了帝国主义和国内外反动派三次颠复阴谋以后，正沿着民主、民族革命的道路向前迈进。这一个时期来，亚非新的独立国家一个接着一个出现，马来亚、苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯、加纳和几内亚的人民相继成为自己国家的主人。阿尔及利亚人民经过长期的、艰苦的武装斗争，终于成立了共和国临时政府，并且正在坚持着英勇的民族解放战争。我们特别兴奋地看到，最近以来，撒哈拉以南的非洲地区的民族独立运动有了蓬勃的发展。帝国主义已经被迫同意尼日利亚、多哥、喀麦隆和索马里兰在1960年独立。一向被殖民主义者视为“安定的绿洲”的刚果，燃起了反殖民主义的怒火。在尼亚萨兰、南北罗得西亚和非洲其他地区的民族独立运动也在风起云涌，震撼着帝国主义在非洲的殖民统治。伟大的非洲人民已经觉醒，他们全部成为非洲大陆的主人的日子已经不远了。
    亚非人民在民族解放斗争中所取得的这一系列的胜利，加速了帝国主义殖民体系的瓦解，挫败了帝国主义在亚非的侵略和扩张，打乱了帝国主义准备新战争的计划。我们高兴地看到，越来越多的亚非独立国家奉行着和平中立政策，亚非和平地区正在不断扩大，亚非国家在国际事务中正在起着越来越重要的作用。在亚非人民的坚决打击下面，帝国主义多年来苦心孤诣所拼凑的军事集团正在摇摇欲坠。巴格达条约已经实际上破产了，马尼拉条约也越来越失灵了。尽管美帝国主义采取发动军事政变的办法来加强对它的仆从国家的控制，但是美国同这些国家的矛盾却越来越尖锐了。这些国家的人民反对美国建立和扩大军事基地、反对美国试验和运进核武器、反对本国政府追随美国的扩军备战政策、要求走和平中立道路的斗争，正在日趋高涨。特别是经历过原子武器灾害的日本人民，几年来在争取独立、和平、民主的道路上进行了不屈不挠的斗争。目前日本人民正在展开规模空前的群众运动，反对岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”，反对用核武器武装日本军队，要求实行中立政策。日本人民的这一斗争严重地阻碍着美国利用日本在远东扩大侵略和准备新战争的阴谋。
    四年来，亚非民族独立国家在发展民族经济方面也取得了显著的成就。深受帝国主义剥削和压榨之苦的亚非各国人民，深知没有经济的独立就不可能有完全的民族独立。为了巩固独立，为了消除由于长期殖民统治所造成的贫困和落后状态，亚非国家的人民和他们的领导者们作了种种努力，在探求一条发展民族经济的道路，我们高兴地看到，有些国家正在有成效地执行着长期的经济建设计划，有些国家正在逐步地开发自己的资源，建立自己的工厂矿山，有些国家正在设法改善农业的耕作。中国工农业建设的大跃进和其它一切亚非国家的建设成就，有力地驳斥了帝国主义散布的所谓落后国家无力进行经济建设的谬论，限制和打击了帝国主义的经济扩张，提高了亚非国家争取经济独立的信心。尽管帝国主义还企图利用某些亚非国家的经济困难，通过所谓援助来转嫁危机，从经济上政治上控制这些国家，但是，已经赢得了政治独立的亚非国家人民一定能够依靠自己的努力和相互的支持，摆脱帝国主义的经济控制，逐步走上独立发展的道路。
    随着亚非民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，亚非各国人民在共同斗争中的相互支持和友好合作也在不断地加强。四年来各国领导人之间有了广泛的接触，各国间的贸易往来和文化交流有了迅速的发展。继万隆会议之后，在亚非地区召开了一系列的重要会议，如亚非人民团结大会、非洲独立国家会议、亚非经济会议、全非人民大会以及亚非学生、妇女、作家会议等等。这些会议对于促进亚非人民的相互了解和友好团结起了重大的作用。亚非人民的团结合作大大鼓舞和推动了亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。
    同志们，朋友们！民族独立运动的高涨是我们时代的一个重要特征，这个特征不仅表现在亚洲和非洲而且同样地表现在拉丁美洲。伟大的万隆精神早已超出了地区的界限，对全世界特别是拉丁美洲发生了越来越深远的影响，近几年来，拉丁美洲人民在反对美国控制、维护民族独立和争取民主自由的斗争中，取得了一连串的重大胜利。美国在拉丁美洲所扶植的独裁政权纷纷垮台，美国在拉丁美洲的名声越来越臭。特别令人鼓舞的是，紧靠着美国身旁的英勇的古巴人民，根本不把美国的军舰、原子弹、氢弹放在眼里，敢于用武装斗争推翻反动的亲美政府，并且坚决地反击了美国的干涉。这说明拉丁美洲人民的斗争正在方兴未艾。拉丁美洲人民的这些胜利不能不对亚非人民的民族解放斗争发生极大的鼓舞和影响。
    万隆会议以后，亚非民族独立运动所出现的空前高涨的局面，是同东风压倒西风的总的国际形势分不开的，特别是同社会主义国家对民族独立运动的坚强支持分不开的。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营始终把支援民族独立运动当作自己的神圣的义务。每当亚非民族独立运动处在紧要关头的时候，苏联和其他社会主义国家总是及时地给以有力的支援，这一点在英法对埃及发动侵略战争的时候，在美国对叙利亚进行战争威胁的时候，在美英武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦并且企图进攻新生的伊拉克的时候，都得到了最确凿的证明。此外，印度尼西亚人民、阿尔及利亚人民、阿曼人民及其他亚非人民，他们在反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中也无不得到社会主义国家的热情的声援。为了帮助亚非国家发展自己的民族经济，苏联和其他社会主义国家还不附带任何条件地向许多亚非民族独立国家提供了经济、技术援助。谁都知道，当帝国主义对埃及、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家实行经济封锁的时候，正是苏联和其他社会主义国家帮助他们冲破了这种封锁。当帝国主义用撤销贷款对阿联施加经济压力的时候，正是苏联向阿联提供了七亿卢布的低利贷款并且以四亿卢布的贷款帮助阿联设计和建设阿斯旺水坝的第一期工程。这些事实以及许许多多其他事实都一再证明，社会主义阵营是亚非人民在争取民族解放斗争中的最忠实、最可靠的朋友。
    中国是万隆会议的参加国，又是和平共处五项原则的发起国。中国人民同其他亚非国家人民有着长期遭受殖民主义压迫的共同经历，而现在，帝国主义还占领着我国的领土台湾，并且正在加紧制造“两个中国”企图达到它永远霸占台湾的目的，这是中国人民绝对不能够容忍的。中国人民正在进行着解放台湾、反对美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的斗争。因此，中国人民和亚非各国人民很自然的具有深切同情和相互支持的愿望。四年来，我国人民同亚非民族独立运动建立了越来越密切的联系，我国同亚非国家的友好合作关系有了进一步的巩固和发展。我国人民对于亚非各国人民争取和维护民族独立的每一个正义的斗争，都给了尽可能的支持。同时，亚非各国人民也有力地支持了我国人民反对美国侵略、维护国家主权和领土完整的斗争。这种共同斗争中的相互支持，进一步考验和发展了我们彼此间的友谊和团结。
    同志们，朋友们！当我们欢呼亚非民族独立运动的伟大胜利的时候，我们必须对帝国主义新的侵略阴谋保持高度的警惕。帝国主义殖民势力是不会自动退出历史舞台的。我们的胜利越大，帝国主义就越害怕，他们越是接近死亡，就越要进行垂死的挣扎。特别是亚非人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义，正在千方百计地进行反扑。美国除了直接进行武力威胁和武装镇压以外，还在拼凑军事集团，缔结军事条约，策动军事政变，组织颠复活动。最近，美国同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦签订了双边军事条约，企图以此代替实际上已经破产了的巴格达条约集团，策动对中近东的新的侵略和颠复活动。美国最近还胁迫和勾结东南亚一些国家的反动派，采取了一系列危害东南亚的和平安全的行动。美国公然破坏日内瓦协议，企图把老挝拉进马尼拉侵略集团，变老挝为美国的军事基地。美国唆使南越吴庭艳集团侵略我国的西沙群岛，危害其他邻国的安全。美国还策动泰国、南越对柬埔寨进行颠复，企图破坏柬埔寨的独立和中立地位。最近美帝国主义更通过在惠灵顿召开的马尼拉条约集团理事会会议，策划对东南亚各国的侵略阴谋和颠复活动。帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义在亚非地区的这一系列的侵略行为和阴谋，说明亚非人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的斗争仍然是一个具有严重性的任务。但是，正当亚非人民加倍警惕，同帝国主义继续进行坚决斗争的时候，在某些亚非国家中居然有些政治家认为反帝任务已经结束，可以把斗争的锋芒指向人民，这正中了帝国主义的下怀。我们希望他们能够认清反帝的目标，继续和人民在一起，来完成反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的大业。如果他们一定要放弃反帝的旗帜，他们就一定会遭受到人民的唾弃。
    同志们，朋友们！万隆会议以来四年的历史，充分证明：亚非国家内部的团结、亚非各国之间的团结、亚非各国和社会主义国家之间的团结，是亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的根本保障，是帝国主义在亚非地区进行侵略和扩张的严重障碍。因此，帝国主义十分仇视这种团结并且从来没有放弃每一个机会来破坏这种团结。最近，帝国主义特别是美帝国主义，在它公开的侵略和干涉遭到一系列失败以后正在施展更阴险的手法，挑拨离间，散布不和，企图从内部来分裂亚非团结，破坏亚非民族独立运动。尤其值得注意的是，美帝国主义正在利用阿拉伯民族独立运动中所出现的某种困难和复杂的局势，企图策动阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人，掀起一个反苏、反共的逆流，以便实现它对阿拉伯国家的新的侵略和颠复阴谋。而现代修正主义者正甘心作美帝国主义的仆从，为这一阴谋的实现效劳。但是，这种阴谋已经被越来越多的阿拉伯人民所识破。最近，美帝国主义和它的仆从们——现代修正主义者和某些亚非国家的亲美反动势力，又在利用西藏问题，大肆叫嚣，诬蔑我国平息西藏叛乱是侵略、扩张，是违反五项原则，企图掀起一个反对中国、破坏五项原则的逆流，挑拨我国同印度和东南亚各国的友好关系。但是，帝国主义和外国反动派的这种卑鄙手段也是蒙蔽不了亚非人民的耳目的。谁都知道，西藏自十三世纪以来就是中国的领土，中国人民在自己的领土上平定叛乱，这纯粹是中国的内政，任何人都不能以任何形式来进行干涉。最近，印度广大人民和公正舆论已经明确表示，坚决反对在西藏问题上采取任何有损中印友谊的作法，要求警惕帝国主义的挑拨伎俩，这是值得欢迎的友好的态度。然而，印度的少数扩张主义分子，甚至某些印度的政治家，却不顾和平共处的五项原则和万隆精神，竟公然支持西藏武装叛乱，干涉中国内政，企图把西藏从中国分裂出去。这是完全承继了英帝国主义的衣钵。这样的阴谋注定是要失败的。在今天的时代里，谁要迎合帝国主义的意旨，背离和平共处五项原则，背离万隆精神，进行不利于亚非团结的勾当，谁就绝对不会有什么好的下场。
    同志们，朋友们！为世界各国爱好和平的人民所一致支持的万隆精神，已经成为亚非人民在政治生活中向前迈进的主流，这决不是一小撮帝国主义分子和反动派所能阻挡的。他们的疯狂叫嚣不是说明他们的强大，而恰恰是说明他们的恐慌。形势对于人民有利，而不利于帝国主义和一切反动派。周恩来总理四年前在万隆会议上说过：“如果我们决心维护世界和平，就没有人能够把我们拖入战争；如果我们决心争取和维护民族独立，就没有人能够继续奴役我们；如果我们决心友好合作，就没有人能够分裂我们。”这在今天依然是我们的行动的准绳。万隆精神是无往而不胜利的。中国人民将永远同亚非各国人民团结在一起，高举着万隆会议的大旗，为实现和平共处、为争取反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义斗争的彻底胜利而奋斗到底！
    万隆精神万岁！
    亚非人民大团结万岁！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
