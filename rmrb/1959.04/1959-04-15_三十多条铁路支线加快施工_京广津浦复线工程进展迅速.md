Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The railway construction army throughout our country is fighting heroically to pave the way for the realization of this year's steel, coal, grain, and cotton targets. News of their victories continues to pour in, both in the construction of branch lines and in the double-tracking projects of major trunk lines.

Currently, over thirty industrial and mining branch lines are under construction throughout the country. Most of these branch lines connect to emerging steel and coal bases. Examples include the branch line from Tongguanshan Iron Mine in Anhui Province to Wuhu, and the branch line from Guanwushan Iron Mine in Sichuan Province to Zhongba, both of which will play a significant role in developing the local steel industry. Among the coal branch lines under construction are the branch line connecting Shaoyang (Hunan), a new coking coal base in our country, to Loudi, the branch line from Fengcheng (Jiangxi) to Xianguling, and the Pingdingshan-Baofeng branch line in Henan Province. At present, many coal bases in various southern provinces are under construction, and the construction of these branch lines will directly promote the construction of these bases.

In the forests of Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and other places, some forest branch lines are also under intense construction, including the Yakeshi forest line in Inner Mongolia, and the Xinqing-Kuerbin branch line in Heilongjiang Province. Also under construction are the railway branch line for the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station in Gansu, and the Yantongshan-Huadian oil mine branch line in Jilin. According to statistics from the Ministry of Railways, the roadbed engineering of some of these branch lines has been basically completed. Among them, the Luopu-Tunqiu branch line in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has already started laying tracks, and the bridge and culvert engineering has also been basically completed; the Luoyang-Yiyang branch line (coal branch line) in Henan Province and the Xinqing-Kuerbin forest branch line have also started laying tracks.

On another front of railway construction in our country—the construction of the double-tracking projects of the Beijing-Guangzhou and Tianjin-Pukou Railways—good news is constantly being reported. By the end of March, except for individual sections and some bridges, the track-laying project for the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway double-tracking north of Hankou has been basically completed. The Zhengzhou Yellow River double-track bridge, with a total length of 2,889.8 meters, is also under intense construction. Forty-five of its seventy-two piers have commenced construction, and the pipe piles of thirty-one of these piers have been sunk to the designed elevation. Bridge-building heroes are fighting with high morale, determined to conquer the turbulent Yellow River before the flood season arrives, so that the double-tracking project of this major north-south artery can be completed as soon as possible.

On the Tianjin-Pukou Railway double track, more than 520 kilometers of track-laying has been completed, accounting for more than 50% of the total length of the railway.

This year, our country will also see its first electrified railway section—the Baoji-Fengzhou section on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Railway workers fighting in the towering mountains have basically completed the construction of the contact network support poles, and substations along the route are also being built. On the Qinling-Fengzhou section, except for tunnels and large bridges, the stringing work has been completed.

    三十多条铁路支线加快施工
　　京广津浦复线工程进展迅速
    新华社14日讯　我国各地铁路建设大军正在英勇奋战，为实现今年的钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标开路。在修建支线和修建主要干线的复线工程上，都不断传来他们的胜利消息。
    目前，我国各地共有三十多条工矿支线正在施工。这些支线大部是连接新兴的钢铁、煤炭基地的。如安徽省的铜官山铁矿——芜湖的支线，四川省的观雾山铁矿——中坝的支线等，对于发展当地的钢铁工业都将起很大的作用。在兴建中的煤炭支线中，包括连接我国新的出焦煤基地邵阳（湖南）——娄底的支线、丰城（江西）——仙姑岭的支线以及河南省的平顶山——宝丰支线等。目前，很多南方各省的煤炭基地正在建设，这些支线的修建将直接推动这些基地的建设工作。
    在内蒙古、黑龙江、吉林等地的森林中，一些森林支线也正在紧张施工，它们中有内蒙古的牙克石森林线，黑龙江省的新青——库尔滨支线等。同时在兴建中的还有甘肃刘家峡水电站的铁路支线、吉林烟筒山——桦甸油矿支线等。据铁道部统计，这些支线中有一些路基工程已基本上完成，其中广西僮族自治区的洛埠——屯秋支线已经开始铺轨，桥涵工程也已基本完成；河南省的洛阳到宜阳支线（煤炭支线）以及新青——库尔滨森林支线也已经开始铺轨了。
    在我国铁路建设上的另一个战线——修筑京广、津浦铁路复线工程——上也不断传来捷报。到3月底除了个别区间和一些桥梁以外，京广铁路复线工程汉口以北的铺轨工程已基本上完成。全长二千八百八十九点八公尺的郑州黄河复线大桥也正在紧张施工，它的七十二个墩台已有四十五个开工修建，其中有三十一个墩台的管柱已下沉到设计标高。修桥健儿斗志昂扬，决心在洪水季节到来前征服波涛汹涌的黄河，使这个南北大动脉的复线工程早日建成。
    在津浦复线上，也有五百二十多公里完成了铺轨工程，占这条铁路全长的50％以上。
    今年，我国还将出现第一段电气化铁路——宝成铁路上的宝鸡——凤州段。战斗在崇山峻岭间的铁路职工已经基本上完成了接触网支柱的工程，沿路各地的变电所也正在建立。在秦岭——凤州段，除了隧道及大桥以外，挂线工作已经完成。
