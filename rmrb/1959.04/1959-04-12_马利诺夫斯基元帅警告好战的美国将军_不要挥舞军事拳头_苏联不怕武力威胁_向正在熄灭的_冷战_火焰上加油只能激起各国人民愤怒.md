Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 11th - Soviet Defense Minister and Marshal of the Soviet Union, Malinovsky, published an article in today's Soviet "Pravda" regarding the recent bellicose clamoring by American generals. The article pointed out that the forces for peace have achieved certain successes in recent months. Under pressure from the general public, Western countries finally agreed to the Soviet proposal to hold talks to discuss the most important international issues. The Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France agreed to convene a foreign ministers' meeting in Geneva on May 11, which will discuss the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. After the foreign ministers' meeting, high-level talks will follow. This reflects the desire of the people of all countries to ease international tensions and eliminate the causes of disputes and friction through peaceful means.

The article said that the enemies of peace have felt that their policy of creating hostility between East and West and maintaining international tensions is suffering a devastating blow. They are trying to use all kinds of methods and means to obstruct the improvement of the international atmosphere. The diplomatic authorities of the United States and other countries dependent on it, according to their wishes, held a very noisy celebration in Washington to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, the meeting did not fulfill the wishes of its organizers. Serious differences arose at this meeting between the United States and other major participants in the group, as well as between the major partners and small countries participating in the group. The fundamental reason for these differences is the attitude towards the future of negotiations between East and West. The article pointed out that hardly a week goes by without American military figures making threatening speeches.

The article said that now the U.S. Army and Navy generals are particularly keen to talk about the Berlin issue, as if what is being discussed now is not a peaceful solution, but the preparation for a new war. The article then mentioned the war clamoring of General Norstad and General Gruenther, Supreme Commander of the European Armed Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Admiral Burke, Chief of Naval Operations of the United States Navy, and McElroy, the United States Secretary of Defense in this regard.

The article continued, pointing out that when international tensions are showing some signs of easing and preparations for talks are actively underway, it is strange that in the United States there are irresponsible statements about the possibility and determination of the United States armed forces to eliminate the Soviet Union. But this is indeed the case. American officials such as General Twining, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Burke, Chief of Naval Operations, and General White, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, have also made such barbaric remarks. These vile remarks by American military personnel and the various insults to the Soviet Union cannot but be surprising, because these remarks do not help create an atmosphere conducive to the smooth progress of the upcoming talks. These irresponsible remarks are aimed at intimidating the faint-hearted with war, but this does not prove their strength, on the contrary, it is a sign of weakness.

Malinovsky said in the article, "We have heard these belligerent clamoring and threats against the Soviet Union from American military personnel not for the first time. Such remarks cannot scare us. The nerves of the Soviet people are sound, and they have heard threatening remarks in the past."

The article said that these clamoring by senior American military officers first of all makes the Americans themselves, the sober-minded Americans, uneasy, because they cannot fail to realize the danger of such unwise and inflammatory remarks to the United States and to world peace. No wonder there are many people in the United States who are worried that General Twining, who is responsible for protecting the safety of the American people, and his colleagues on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, do not consider that if the imperialist atomic madmen launch a nuclear war, the United States will inevitably suffer a devastating counterattack. The era of the United States being immune to attack is gone forever. Underestimating the actual possibility of the Soviet Union retaliating against aggression, while exaggerating one's own possibilities (especially in the field of strategic ballistic missiles), does not prove that American military figures are rational. It is precisely the American generals who should be very clear that the Soviet Union's retaliatory power and possibilities are no less than those who threaten it. The article said: "The Soviet armed forces vigilantly stand guard, defending their motherland, they do not threaten anyone, but they do not allow anyone to threaten the security of the socialist camp's borders and the peaceful labor of our people." The article pointed out that it is obvious that since the Soviet Union can launch rockets into space hundreds of thousands of kilometers away, then it can launch powerful rockets to any point on the earth with 100% accuracy.

The article said that sober-minded military figures in Western European countries are evaluating the situation and possibilities with a realistic attitude. Some Western European military figures have pointed out that there is not even a shred of reason in the provocative ravings of the American generals.

The article revealed that behind these provocateurs are large monopoly groups, which are concerned with continuing the arms race and exacerbating international tensions in order to obtain mythical profits. They are deliberately trying to sabotage the upcoming East-West meetings. American observer Childs confirmed that these dark forces are putting pressure on the White House from behind the scenes, in order to make the American government adopt a tough and irreconcilable attitude in any negotiations. On their orders, some people in uniform made provocative and inflammatory speeches. The intention of those who instigated this war hysteria is very clear: they want to prevent the creation of a favorable environment for the upcoming negotiations. Their baring of teeth and claws is also due to another need: to suppress the people's call for the elimination of the "Cold War." They are also trying to provoke an anti-Soviet war. But in reality, they have aroused even stronger and deeper indignation everywhere against the aggressive ambitions of the American warmongers.

The article said that now everyone sees more clearly than in the past that the Soviet Union firmly stands on the position of safeguarding peace. The Soviet government is unswervingly striving to resolve all issues through negotiations, rather than from a "position of strength."

The article asked, just as the Soviet Union has put forward proposals to normalize the entire international atmosphere, and there has been some easing of tensions between Eastern and Western countries, should military figures hinder this good thing and add fuel to the dying flames of the "Cold War"? The article said that the American military leaders are doing just that.

The article pointed out that world opinion believes that the statements of the Pentagon spokesmen are a serious threat to the cause of peace.

The article finally reminded the military leaders in Washington that they should listen to these sober calls. The article said: "Anyone who violates the rational propositions of demanding the defense of peace and pursuing a policy of peaceful coexistence is bound to run into a brick wall. Whoever dares to put a military fist on the negotiating table will incur the strong anger of the people of all countries."

The article said: "It must be taken into account, especially the military leaders of the United States must take into account: if the imperialists dare to launch a new world war, then this war will inevitably be the last one, and it must end with the complete defeat of the capitalist world."

### 马利诺夫斯基元帅警告好战的美国将军　不要挥舞军事拳头　苏联不怕武力威胁  向正在熄灭的“冷战”火焰上加油只能激起各国人民愤怒

　　马利诺夫斯基元帅警告好战的美国将军
　　不要挥舞军事拳头　苏联不怕武力威胁
    向正在熄灭的“冷战”火焰上加油只能激起各国人民愤怒
    新华社莫斯科11日电　苏联国防部长、苏联元帅马利诺夫斯基就美国将军们近来不断发出好战叫嚣一事在今天苏联“真理报”上发表文章。文章指出，拥护和平的力量，在最近几个月来获得了一定的成就。西方国家在广大公众的压力下，终于同意苏联所提出的举行会谈讨论最重要的国际问题的这一主张。苏联、美国、英国和法国商定5月11日在日内瓦召开外长会议，这次会议将讨论对德和约和西柏林问题。在外长会议后，接着举行高级会谈。这反映了各国人民的这种愿望：即要求缓和国际紧张局势、通过和平途径消除产生纠纷和摩擦的原因。
    文章说，和平的敌人已经感觉到他们在东西方之间制造敌意、保持国际紧张局势的政策正遭到毁灭性的打击。他们企图使用种种办法和手段来阻挠改善国际气氛。美国和依附它的其他国家的外交当局按照他们的意旨，在华盛顿非常喧嚣地举行了侵略性的北大西洋公约组织十周年纪念会。但是，会议并没有使它的组织者如愿以偿。在这次会议上，美国和这个集团的其他主要参加国之间，以及参加这个集团的主要伙伴和小国之间发生了严重的分歧。产生这种分歧的根本原因是对待东西方谈判前途的态度。文章指出，很少有一个星期美国军事活动家不发表威胁性的讲话。
    文章说，现在美国陆海军将领特别起劲地谈论柏林问题，仿佛现在所谈的不是和平解决，而是准备新战争。文章接着提到北大西洋公约组织欧洲武装部队最高司令诺斯塔德和格伦瑟将军、美国海军参谋长伯克海军上将、美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊在这方面的战争叫嚣。
    文章继续指出，当国际紧张局势出现某种缓和并且正在积极筹备会谈的时候，在美国却出现了谈论美国武装部队消灭苏联的可能性和决心的不负责任的言论，这是令人奇怪的。但这的确是事实。美国的官方人士如：参谋长联席会议主席特文宁将军、海军参谋长伯克海军上将、空军参谋长怀特将军也都发表了这种野蛮的言论。美国军人的这些恶劣言论以及侮辱苏联的种种言论不能不使人感到惊奇，因为这些言论无助于创造使即将举行的会谈顺利进行的气氛。这些不负责任的言论指望用战争来恐吓神经衰弱的人，但是，这并不证明他们的强大，相反的，却是软弱的表现。
    马利诺夫斯基在文章中说，“美国军人的这种好战叫嚣和对苏联的威胁，我们已不是第一次听到。这种言论吓不倒我们。苏联人民的神经是健全的，他们过去就听到过威胁的言论。”
    文章说，美国高级军人的这种叫嚣，首先使美国人自己、头脑清醒的美国人感到不安，因为他们不会不意识到这种不明智的煽动性言论对美国、对世界和平的危险性。难怪在美国有不少人担心，负责保卫美国人民安全的特文宁将军和他的参谋长联席会议的同僚，竟不考虑：如果帝国主义原子狂人发动核战争，美国必然会遭到毁灭性的反击。美国不受攻击的时代已经一去不复返了。低估苏联反击侵略的实际可能性，而夸大自己的可能性（特别是在战略弹道火箭方面），并不证明美国军事活动家是理智的。正是美国的将领们应当很清楚，苏联所拥有的回击力量和可能性并不比威胁它的人少。文章说：“苏联武装力量警惕地坚守岗位，保卫着自己的祖国，他们不威胁任何人，但是也不允许任何人威胁社会主义阵营边境的安全和我们人民的和平劳动。”文章指出，十分明显，既然苏联能够把火箭发射到数十万公里的宇宙中去，那末它就可以百发百中地把强大的火箭发射到地球上任何一点。
    文章说，西欧国家头脑清醒的军事家正以现实的态度来评价局势和可能性。西欧军事家中有人指出，在美国将军们的挑衅性谰言中连一点理智也没有。
    文章揭露说，在这些挑拨者幕后操纵的是大垄断集团，它们关心的是继续进行军备竞赛和使国际紧张局势尖锐化，以便获得神话般的利润。他们存心要破坏即将举行的东西方会议。美国观察家蔡尔兹证实，这些黑暗势力正在从幕后对白宫施加压力，为的是使美国政府在任何谈判中都采取强硬的和不可调和的态度。依照他们的命令，一些穿军服的人们便发表了挑衅性的煽动演说，煽起这次战争歇斯底里的人们的意图十分明显：他们想阻挠为即将举行的谈判创造良好的环境。他们这样张牙舞爪还出于另一种需要：即压制人民要求消灭“冷战”的呼声。他们还企图挑起反苏战争。但是实际上却到处激起了更加强烈的对美国战争狂人侵略野心的深深的愤慨。
    文章说，现在大家比过去更加清楚地看到，苏联坚定地站在维护和平的立场上。苏联政府正在不屈不挠地争取用谈判的方法、而不是从“实力地位”来解决一切问题。
    文章问道，正当苏联提出使整个国际气氛正常化的建议、东西方国家之间紧张关系有了某些缓和的时候，军界人士是否应该阻挠这件好事，并向正在熄灭的“冷战”的火焰上加油呢？文章说，美国的军界领导人士正是这样做的。
    文章指出，世界舆论认为，五角大楼发言人的言论是对和平事业的严重威胁。
    文章最后提醒华盛顿的军事首领们应该听取上述这些清醒的呼声。文章说：“凡是违反要求保卫和平和奉行和平共处政策的合理主张的人，必定要碰得头破血流。谁胆敢把军事拳头放在谈判桌上，谁就要招致各国人民的强烈愤怒。”
    文章说：“必须考虑到，特别是美国的军事领导人物必须考虑到：如果帝国主义者竟敢发动新的世界大战，那末这种战争必然是最后一次，而且它一定以资本主义世界的完全失败而告终。”
