　　Green Gold
　　Zhou Erfu
　　When I was in São Paulo, Brazil, I visited a coffee plantation. At that time, São Paulo was in the hot summer, and living in this fastest-growing city in the world, it was a bit sultry. The car drove out of the city, and the wind blowing in from the car window was still hot.
　　Although the climate in São Paulo is a bit too hot for people, it is very suitable for coffee. Brazil's coffee production is the highest in the world, and it is known as the "Coffee Kingdom." The coffee production in São Paulo State accounts for about two-thirds of Brazil's total, and people call São Paulo the "City of Coffee." We went to visit the São Quirilo coffee plantation in Campinas.
　　Although Brazil's coffee production ranks first in the world, coffee did not originally grow in Brazil. The motherland of coffee is Ethiopia in Africa. Coffee has a strong stimulating effect, and initially, Islamic peoples in Asia and Africa were forbidden to drink coffee. Due to colonial plundering, Europe began to have coffee in the sixteenth century. However, at that time, it was not widely used as a beverage, but as a medicine, and it could only be bought in pharmacies. It was not until the eighteenth century that someone brought coffee to Europe, but because the climate was unsuitable, it could only be tried by experts in botanical gardens and treated as specimens.
　　So how did coffee spread to Brazil?
　　As early as 1720, when the supply ship of the French colony was about to come to the Americas, Captain De Clieu asked the botanical garden in Paris for three coffee seedlings, preparing to bring them to the New World for trial planting. Unfortunately, this ship encountered a great storm in the Atlantic Ocean and could not reach the port in time. The three coffee seedlings lacked fresh water. By the time the supply ship reached the port, two of them had died, and the other one was hanging by a thread, but it finally arrived in the New World, first planted in the West Indies. After propagation, coffee went from Central America to French Guiana, and then to Brazil.
　　Once coffee arrived in Brazil, it was like entering paradise, thriving and multiplying rapidly. Coffee is like a weak and sickly lady, not easy to serve. It needs fertile soil, and it also needs a good climate. Too dry or too much rain will prevent a good harvest, and cold weather is especially an enemy. The most suitable temperature for it is 13 to 30 degrees Celsius. Brazil happens to have all these conditions, especially São Paulo.
　　Therefore, Brazil has become the second hometown of coffee and is famous throughout the world. Her motherland, Ethiopia, is not so well known.
　　São Quirilo is one of the famous coffee plantations in São Paulo.
　　On both sides of the highway from São Paulo to São Quirilo are fertile, brownish-red lands. Looking out, it is truly a "red" land for miles. When we arrived in the small city of Campinas, we turned to the right, and the car was completely moving on the brownish-red land.
　　In the distance, I saw rows of eucalyptus trees standing tall in the sky, as if blocking half of the azure sky. In a grove of green trees, I vaguely saw a small bungalow with a red roof, which was the office of the coffee plantation. The foreman, Maurice, who had been here for seven months, came out to greet us. He was a middle-aged man, wearing a tweed hat, long yellow leather boots, and his face was tanned dark. He enthusiastically led us to a piece of experimental field diagonally opposite the office to see.
　　This plantation has a history of ninety years, and in the past, it produced very little, and the quality was not good enough. The owner decided to cut down the old coffee trees, and only in the past four years has it begun to produce abundantly. In order to improve quality, they are trying to grow famous varieties from various countries. There is Arabica coffee here, as well as African coffee. The characteristics of African coffee are: hard, spicy, and particularly strong in taste.
　　Past the experimental field, there are large areas of coffee trees, planted very neatly, looking like a huge emerald chessboard, with rows of eucalyptus trees standing tall at the edges of the chessboard. This is a windbreak forest, using its body to resist strong winds and hail, protecting the coffee like a nanny. The coffee is now less than two meters tall, and after it matures, it will be no more than three meters tall. It blooms in March and April every year, and is harvested once in May and June. Usually, mature red coffee beans, called cherry fruits, also called coffee cherries, can be picked by hand. Each plant can harvest fifteen to twenty liters. This liter is a unique unit of the coffee plantation, because the workers are illiterate, so they use liter measures the size of milk bottles to calculate.
　　There are not many workers in this plantation on weekdays. Temporary workers are hired during the harvest season, mostly women and children. They work nine hours a day, and each liter harvested is paid one and a half cruzeiros (Brazilian currency). Women can earn ninety-five cruzeiros a day, and children can only earn about forty cruzeiros. Once the coffee beans are picked, these women are unemployed. Foreman Maurice's salary is the highest, but it is only ten thousand cruzeiros (about seventy US dollars).
　　As we were looking out in the windbreak forest, suddenly a jeep sped over. The car door opened, and a middle-aged man jumped out, with a small mustache on his mouth, wearing a gray suit and black long leather boots, walking towards us. Maurice told me: he is the owner, Natol, who came from the city to entertain us. The two brothers each manage one aspect, one manages livestock, and the plantation raises seven hundred Dutch cows; the other manages the coffee and sugarcane plantations.
　　Natol invited us to get into his jeep, pass through the coffee forest, and came to the coffee platform. The coffee platform is the coffee processing equipment, with a total of six layers, in the shape of steps, one layer lower than the other. After the coffee beans are harvested, they are washed to remove the soil in the first layer, spread on the first layer of platform to dry, and sent to the second layer through the groove in front of the platform for peeling, then washed again, and finally sent to the sixth layer to dry again, but it is not enough, and it must be sent to the dryer to dry. The dryer can dry 340 kilograms at a time, and every 180 liters can produce a bag of coffee – 60 kilograms.
　　I asked Natol how the harvest was this year? A smile spread across his face, and he said with great confidence: it must be a bumper harvest. When asked how the coffee business was recently? He immediately frowned. I have seen this expression in Rio de Janeiro, I have seen this expression on the beautiful horizon, and I have also seen this expression in the city of São Paulo. I understand the melancholy hidden deep in his heart.
　　Brazil produces about 20 million bags of coffee every year. 18 million bags were produced in 1957-1958, and it is estimated that 24 million bags will be produced in 1958-1959. Of course, Brazil, with a population of more than 60 million, does not need so many stimulating drinks. It mainly exports. After World War II, the traditional trade relations between Latin America and Europe were damaged, that is, controlled by American imperialism. Brazil's coffee is almost completely controlled by the United States. In Brazil, four American companies headed by the "American Coffee Company" control 60%-70% of Brazil's coffee exports. Their main activities are in São Paulo. Brazil can get 900 million US dollars in foreign exchange from coffee exports every year. This foreign exchange figure is equal to 70% of Brazil's total annual foreign exchange income. Relying on this foreign exchange, Brazil pays for the industrial products, machinery, equipment, petroleum products and food that must be imported every year. It is no exaggeration to say that coffee is Brazil's main lifeline. Therefore, even a small fluctuation in coffee prices will inevitably affect Brazil's entire economic situation, not to mention a reduction in coffee exports.
　　Controlling Brazil's throat is the American monopoly organization. American monopoly organizations buy Brazilian coffee at the lowest price and sell their own industrial products to Brazil at extremely high prices, not only greedily squeezing Brazil, but also trampling on Brazil's independence, freedom and national dignity through economic means.
　　First, let's look at the tricks the United States plays with prices. From 1956-1957, it was 57 cents per pound, and in 1958 it dropped to 47 cents per pound. If the American bosses think they want to further strangle Brazil, they will probably cut prices again in 1959.
　　Historically, the United States has consistently used price cuts to suffocate Brazil's life and hinder Brazil's development. Let's not talk about anything else, just talk about President Vargas's suicide. The suicide of this president was not due to personal reasons, nor due to family reasons, nor due to social reasons, and certainly not due to the struggle between domestic political parties, but due to coffee reasons. At that time, coffee was 80 cents per pound, and the American monopoly organization wanted to cut the price to 35 cents, in other words, to reduce coffee foreign exchange income by more than half, which would have a huge impact on the Brazilian economy. The president did not agree – no Brazilian with a conscience would agree. The Wall Street bosses opened their mouths: Mr. President, do you want to raise coffee prices? There is a way, hand over Brazil's oil to me. An imperialist's vicious face is completely revealed. This portrait is not the work of an artist from any country with anti-imperialist ideas, but a self-portrait of the master of the White House. The murderer who murdered President Vargas was the master of the White House. In order to never forget this hatred, the Brazilian people named a wide road in Rio de Janeiro Vargas Avenue.
　　The Wall Street bosses' defenders may stand up and fulfill their duty as lackeys to flatter them, saying that the US dollar is valuable and constantly rising, etc. Then, let's look at the facts of the US dollar's rise. I don't want to say anything myself. It's best to ask Brazilian friends to talk about it. Mr. Dantas, the former president of the Bank of Brazil, gave a speech on the government's coffee policy at the economic meeting of the National Industry Association. One passage pointed out: In 1910, the price of a cup of coffee in the United States was 10 cents, and now it is 15 cents, an increase of 50%. The price of wheat in the same period rose from 85 cents to 2.50 dollars, an increase of nearly three times. The prices of other products such as steel, meat and many raw materials also increased in proportion to wheat. At the same time, according to statistics, the value of 500 US dollars in 1920 is equal to 2,500 US dollars today. The noble US dollar has depreciated five times, that is, prices have increased five times, while coffee has only increased by 50%. This is the index, this is the fact.
　　From Dantas's narration filled with the blood and tears of the Brazilian people, we once again see the ugly face of American imperialism. Why has the United States not only been cutting prices recently, but also reducing coffee imports? This is an old policy with a new twist.
　　The United States is not entirely reducing coffee imports because of its own economic crisis. The United States, through FBI agents stationed in Brazil and so-called research institutions, which are actually intelligence agencies, knows the situation of Brazilian coffee production like the back of its hand. In 1957-1958, Brazil produced 18 million bags of coffee, and exports decreased by 2 million bags. It is estimated that 24 million bags will be produced in 1958-1959, and possibly 14 million bags will be exported. The remaining coffee, plus the coffee stored in recent years, will reach 25 million to 30 million bags that cannot be sold. This huge number is worth about 1.8 billion US dollars, which greatly exceeds Brazil's total annual foreign exchange income. The impact on Brazil's economic life is self-evident.
　　Coffee and the Brazilian people are simply like fish and water. Not only can they not do without coffee in their daily lives, but coffee is directly and closely related to their economic lives and national destiny. It is no accident that I hear people talking about coffee everywhere in Brazil. People also sing praises to coffee everywhere. Listen to the following song:
　　The wooden pestle gently pounds,
　　Little girl, sieve quickly,
　　Coffee, good morning!
　　The coffee people drink,
　　Emits fragrance,
　　She comes from the spring earth.
　　Coffee, good morning!
　　You are the green gold and hope,
　　In the breeze,
　　Leaning forward and backward,
　　In our Brazilian morning.
　　Coffee, good morning!
　　Brown coffee,
　　You are small and exquisite,
　　How delicious you are.
　　Coffee, good morning!
　　Drink a cup in the morning,
　　You brought
　　A mouthful of fragrance.
　　Coffee, good morning!
　　The wooden pestle gently pounds,
　　Little girl, sieve quickly...
　　In Brazil, people sing praises to coffee as green gold and hope, which is not an artistic exaggeration at all, but a true reflection of real life.
　　Robbers' eyes turn red when they see money, and this is not an exaggeration. The robbers in the gold-worshiping kingdom, when they see money, their eyes not only turn red, but also turn purple. American imperialism, facing the green gold, has come up with new tricks: in addition to continuing to lower coffee prices, it also wants to reduce coffee imports.
　　Reducing imports plus lowering prices, the Wall Street bosses know that at a certain time, Brazil will inevitably lack foreign exchange and urgently need loans. At that time, Eisenhower and Dulles and their ilk will smilingly put on a charitable face and say triumphantly: Do you want US dollars? We have them here. Do you want to raise coffee prices? We can discuss it. Do you want to increase imports? We can consider it. But there is one condition: hand over the oil to me.
　　American imperialism is like a big mountain pressing on the Brazilian people, creating financial crises, stifling the development of national industries, and choking Brazil's throat. Only by pushing down this big mountain can we open up a prosperous, happy, and free road to prosperity.
　　This is why every Brazilian cannot help but reveal the deep melancholy in their hearts when talking about coffee. But the heroic Brazilian people are not sad. They are the masters of the Brazilian land, the masters of green gold, and also the masters of hope. Moreover, this big mountain of American imperialism is not a big mountain at all. In fact, it is just a snow mountain. As long as the Brazilian people's brilliant sunshine rises everywhere, the snow mountain will quickly melt and disappear.
　　Walking out of the São Quirilo coffee plantation, thinking of the scenes I visited in various parts of Brazil, I am completely convinced that the heroic Brazilian people will surely realize their hopes and great ideals.

　　Before processing coffee, the debris in the coffee beans must first be screened out with a sieve.

　　绿色的金子
　　周而复
    在巴西圣保罗的时候，我访问过一个咖啡种植园。那时圣保罗正是炎热的夏天，住在这个世界上发展最快的城市里，热得有点儿闷人。汽车开出了市区，从车窗里吹进来的风，也还是热腾腾的。
    圣保罗的气候对人来说，虽然稍为嫌热一点，但是对咖啡却非常适宜。巴西的咖啡产量是世界第一，被称做咖啡王国。圣保罗州的咖啡产量又占巴西的三分之二左右，人们叫圣保罗是咖啡之城。我们去参观的是康帕斯的圣奎利罗咖啡园。
    虽然巴西咖啡产量居世界首位，可是咖啡最初并不生长在巴西。咖啡的祖国是非洲的埃塞俄比亚。咖啡有强烈的刺激性，最初亚非各地伊斯兰教民族是禁止喝咖啡的。由于殖民地的掠夺，十六世纪欧洲开始有咖啡了。不过，当时还没有普遍当做饮料，只是一种药物，在药房里才能买到它。到了十八世纪才有人把咖啡带到欧洲来，因为气候不适宜，只能在植物园里由专家们试种，被当做标本。
    那么，咖啡怎么传到巴西来的呢？
    远在1720年的时候，法国殖民地的辎重军要到美洲来，船长戴克理向巴黎植物园要了三株咖啡秧，准备带到新大陆来试种。不幸这只船在大西洋途中遇了大风大浪，没有能够及时到达港口。三株咖啡秧缺乏淡水，等辎重船到达港口的时候，死去了两株，另外一株九死一生，但总算到了新大陆，首先在西印度群岛种植。咖啡经过繁殖，从中美到了法属圭亚那，然后才传到巴西。
    咖啡一到了巴西，就像是进了乐园，欣欣向荣，很快地繁殖起来了。咖啡像是体弱多病的小姐，不大容易侍候。她需要肥沃的土壤，还需要良好的气候，太旱不能丰收，多雨也不能丰收，寒冷尤其是大敌。对她来说，最适当的温度是十三度到三十度。巴西恰巧都具备这些条件，特别是圣保罗。
    巴西于是乎成了咖啡的第二故乡，而闻名于世界。她的祖国埃塞俄比亚倒反而不大为人知道了。
    圣奎利罗是圣保罗的著名的咖啡园之一。
    从圣保罗到圣奎利罗公路两旁尽是棕红色的肥沃的土地，放眼望去，真是“赤”地千里。到了康帕斯这个小城市，向右边转出去，汽车就完全在棕红色土地上前进了。
    远远我看见一排排的桉树矗立云霄，好像把蔚蓝色的晴空遮去了一半。在一片绿荫的树丛中，隐隐看到一座红色屋顶的小洋房，这是咖啡园办公的地方。出来接待我们的是刚来七个月的工头，叫摩理士。他是个中年人，戴着一顶呢帽，穿着长统的黄色皮靴，脸上晒得黧黑。他热情地把我们领到办公室斜对面的一片试验田去看。
    这个园子有九十年的历史，过去生产的很少，质量也不够好。园主决定把老咖啡树砍去，最近四年来才开始丰产。为了提高质量，他们试种各国名种，这儿有阿拉伯咖啡，也有非洲咖啡。非洲的咖啡的特点是：硬，辣，味道特别浓。
    试验田过去，便是一大片一大片咖啡树，种得非常整齐，看上去就像是一个巨大无比的翡翠的棋盘一样，棋盘的边缘站着高入云端的成排的桉树。这是防护林，用她的身子抵挡大风和冰雹，保姆一般的保护咖啡。现在咖啡长的还不到两公尺，成熟以后，最高也不过三公尺。每年3、4月开花，5、6月收成一次，平时可以用手摘下成熟了的红色咖啡子，叫做樱桃果，又叫做咖啡樱桃，一株可以收十五到二十公升。这个公升，是咖啡园自己特有的单位，因为工人不识字，就以牛乳瓶大小的升子来计算。
    这个园子平时工人并不多，到收获的季节雇临时工，大半是妇女和儿童。每天工作九小时，每收一公升付一块半克鲁赛罗（巴币），妇女一天可以得到九十五个克鲁赛罗，儿童只能得到四十克鲁赛罗左右。一旦咖啡子摘完，这些妇女便失业了。工头摩理士的工资是最高的，也不过一万克鲁赛罗（约合七十美元）。
    当我们正在防护林里眺望的时候，忽然一辆吉普车急驶而来，车门开处，跳下一个中年男子，嘴上有一撇小胡须，一身灰色西装，脚上穿着黑色的长统皮靴，向我们面前走来。摩理士告诉我：他是园主那托尔，特地从城里赶来招待我们的。他们兄弟二人，各管一个方面，一个管牲口，园里养了七百头荷兰牛；一个管咖啡和甘蔗园。
    那托尔请我们坐上他的吉普车，穿过咖啡林，来到了咖啡台。咖啡台是咖啡的加工设备，一共有六层，台阶形，一层低一层。咖啡子收下以后，在第一层洗去泥土，铺在第一层平台上晒干，随着平台前面的槽口送到第二层，去皮、再洗，最后送到第六层再晒，但是还不够，必须再送到烘干机去烘干。烘干机一次可以烘三百四十公斤，每一百八十公升，可出一袋咖啡——六十公斤。
    我问那托尔今年的收成怎么样？他脸上漾开了笑纹，很有把握地说：一定丰收。再问他最近咖啡的生意怎么样？他马上蹙起了眉头。我在里约热内卢看到过这样的表情，我在美丽的地平线看到过这样的表情，我在圣保罗市内也看到过这样的表情，我懂得蕴藏在他内心深处的忧郁。
    巴西每年生产两千万包左右咖啡。1957—1958年生产一千八百万包，估计1958—1959年要生产二千四百万包。当然，六千多万人口的巴西是不需要这么多的刺激性的饮料的，主要是输出。第二次世界大战以后，拉丁美洲和欧洲的传统的贸易关系遭受到破坏，也就是说被美帝国主义所左右了，巴西的咖啡几乎完全被美国控制。在巴西有以“美国咖啡公司”为首的四家美国公司控制了巴西咖啡出口的60％—70％。他们主要的活动在圣保罗。巴西一年从出口咖啡中可以得到九亿美元的外汇。这个外汇数字等于整个巴西一年外汇收入的70％。依靠这些外汇，巴西支付每年必需进口的工业品、机器、装备、石油产品和粮食的款项。如果说咖啡是巴西的主要的生命线，那一点也不夸大。因此，咖啡价格的微小的波动，必然要影响巴西的整个经济情况，更不必说咖啡出口减少了。
    控制着巴西咽喉的是美国的垅断组织。美国垅断组织以最低的价格收购巴西的咖啡，而以极高的价格出卖本国工业品给巴西，不仅贪婪无餍地压榨巴西，而且通过经济手段蹂躏巴西独立、自由和民族的尊严。
    请先看看美国在价格上玩的花样。从1956—1957年是五角七分美金一磅，1958年又降到四角七分美金一磅。如果美国大老板们认为要进一步扼杀巴西，1959年大概还要杀价。
    历史上美国一贯用杀价来窒息巴西的生命和阻碍巴西的发展的。别的且不说吧，就说瓦加斯总统的自杀吧。这位总统自杀，既不是由于个人原因，也不是由于家庭原因，更不是由于社会原因，当然也不是由于国内政党之间斗争的原因，而是咖啡原因。当时咖啡每磅八角美金，美国垅断组织要压价到三角五美金，换句话说要减少咖啡外汇收入的一半以上，那对巴西经济的影响是多么巨大啊。总统不答应——任何一个有良心的巴西人都不会答应的。华尔街老板开口了：总统先生，你要提高咖啡价格吗？有一个办法，把巴西的石油交给我。一副帝国主义穷凶极恶的嘴脸完全显现出来了。这幅画像并不是哪一个国家具有反帝思想的艺术家的作品，而是白宫主人的自画像。谋害瓦加斯总统的凶手就是白宫主人。巴西人民为了永不忘记这个仇恨，把里约热内卢的一条宽广的马路命名为瓦加斯大街。
    华尔街老板的辩护士们也许会站出来尽他奴才拍马屁的天职，说美金值钱，不断上涨等等理由。那么，我们来看美金上涨的事实吧。我自己并不想说什么，最好还是请巴西朋友出来谈谈。前巴西银行行长但达斯先生在国家工业协会的经济会议里对政府的咖啡政策发表了讲演，其中有一段指出：1910年在美国一杯咖啡价格是一毛美金，现在是一毛五分，上涨50％。同期的小麦价格从八毛五分上涨到两元五毛，涨了近两倍。其他如钢铁、肉类和许多生产品的价格也是按小麦的比例上涨。同时根据统计，1920年的五百美元币值等于现在的二千五百美元。高贵的美元身价跌了五倍，也就是说，物价上涨了五倍，而咖啡不过上涨50％。这是指数，这是事实。
    从但达斯充满了巴西人民血泪的叙述里，我们又一次看到美帝国主义的丑恶的嘴脸。美国为什么最近不但压价而且还要减少咖啡进口呢？这是老政策新花样。
    美国并不完全是因为本身经济危机而减少咖啡进口。美国通过联邦调查局派在巴西的特务人员和所谓研究机关而实际也就是情报机关的人员，对巴西咖啡生产情况了如指掌。1957—1958年巴西生产一千八百万包咖啡，出口减少二百万包，1958—1959年估计要生产二千四百万包，可能出口一千四百万包，剩余的加上近年存余的咖啡将要达到二千五百到三千万包卖不出去，这一个庞大的数字，它的价值是十八亿左右美元，大大超过巴西全年的外汇收入。这对巴西经济生活的影响是不言而喻了。
    咖啡和巴西人民简直是鱼水般的关系，不仅日常生活中一天也缺少不了咖啡，而且咖啡直接地紧密地关系着他们的经济生活和民族命运。我在巴西到处听到人们谈论咖啡，不是偶然的。人们也到处歌颂咖啡，请听下面这支歌子：
    木杵儿轻轻地捣呀，
    小姑娘快快地筛，
    咖啡，您早！
    人们喝的咖啡，
    喷发出芳香，
    她来自春天的大地。
    咖啡，您早！
    你这绿色的金子和希望，
    在微风吹拂下，
    前俯后仰，
    在我们巴西的早晨。
    咖啡，您早！
    棕色的咖啡呀，
    你小巧玲珑，
    你多么可口。
    咖啡，您早！
    清早喝上一杯，
    你带来了
    满口的芬香。
    咖啡，您早！
    木杵儿轻轻地捣呀，
    小姑娘快快地筛……
    在巴西，人们歌颂咖啡是绿色的金子和希望，一点也不是艺术上的夸张，而是真实地反映了现实的生活。
    强盗见了钱眼睛就红了，这也不是夸大之辞。拜金王国里的强盗，一见了钱，眼睛不仅发红，而且一定发紫。美帝国主义面对着绿色的金子，想出了新的花样：除了继续压低咖啡价格，还要减少咖啡进口。
    减少进口加上压低价格，华尔街的老板们知道，到一定时候，巴西必然缺乏外汇，迫切需要贷款，那时候艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯之流就会笑嘻嘻地摆出一副慈善的面孔，得意地说：要美元吗？这儿有。要提高咖啡价格吗？可以商量。要增加进口吗？可以考虑。但是有一个条件：把石油交给我。
    美帝国主义像是一座大山压在巴西人民身上，制造财经危机，窒息民族工业发展，扼住巴西的咽喉。只有推倒这座大山，才能开辟出一条繁荣、幸福、自由的康庄大道。
    这就是每一个巴西人民一谈到咖啡的时候，不得不流露出压抑不住的内心深处的忧郁。但英勇的巴西人民并不悲伤。他们是巴西土地的主人，是绿色的金子的主人，也是希望的主人。并且，美帝国主义的这座大山，并不是什么了不起的大山，实际上不过是一座雪山，只要巴西人民的灿烂的阳光在各地升起，雪山很快就会溶化，消逝。
    走出圣奎利罗咖啡园，想起我在巴西各地访问的情景，我完全相信：英勇的巴西人民一定会实现自己的希望和伟大的理想。

    在加工咖啡之前，先要用筛子将咖啡子中的杂物筛干净。
