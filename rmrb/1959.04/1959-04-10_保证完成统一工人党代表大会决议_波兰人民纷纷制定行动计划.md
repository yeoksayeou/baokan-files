    To Guarantee Completion of the Resolutions of the United Workers' Party Congress
    The Polish People Vigorously Formulate Action Plans
    (People's Daily, Warsaw, April 9) The Polish people in various regions are actively formulating concrete action plans to ensure the realization of the resolutions of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party.
    Following the Party's Third Congress, mass meetings and meetings of Party activists were held across the country. Representatives who attended the Congress communicated the resolutions to workers, farmers, and Party members. Furthermore, the broad masses were organized in groups to study the Congress documents. People everywhere unanimously expressed warm support for the Party's resolutions and pledged to resolutely fight for their thorough implementation.
    Party organizations in various provinces, cities, factories, institutions, enterprises, and rural areas have also convened meetings successively to discuss the issue of implementing the Party Congress's resolutions. Comrade Gomulka personally participated in a meeting of the Party organization at the Zeran Automobile Factory in Warsaw, where he emphasized that every Party organization must formulate an action plan for realizing the resolutions of this Congress. Currently, Party meetings have been held in almost all factories in Warsaw, and plans for realizing the resolutions can be finalized in all factories in April.
    After discussing the resolutions of the "Third Congress," the Party organization and all employees of the Gdansk Shipyard pledged to complete the expanded shipbuilding plan stipulated by the Party. The Torun Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory, the Poznan Ship Engine Factory, and many other large factories and mines have formulated their own plans based on the "Third Congress" resolutions. These plans all emphasized giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, tapping the potential of enterprises, and improving labor productivity to complete the prescribed production targets and other tasks.
    After completing their gift-giving tasks to the Party's Third Congress, workers in many industrial and mining enterprises have put forward new guarantees to the Party for completing their production plans.
    The Trade Union, the Socialist Youth League, the Rural Youth League, and the Polish Academy of Sciences have also convened meetings of activists to discuss the resolutions of the Party's Third Congress and have determined new tasks for their respective departments based on the Party's resolutions.
    The broad masses of farmers also unanimously support the Party's resolutions, and they have drafted many measures to increase agricultural output and build the countryside. Since the Party's Third Congress was held, farmers have also established a number of new agricultural production cooperatives. Two new agricultural production cooperatives in Lublin Province and Kielce Province are named after the "Third Congress."
    After the Congress, the number of people requesting to join the United Workers' Party has increased significantly. In Bydgoszcz Province and Rzeszow Province alone, 350 advanced workers and farmers were admitted to the Party in each province in the few days after the "Third Congress."

    本报华沙9日电　波兰各地人民纷纷制定具体行动计划，以保证实现波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会的决议。
    在党的第三次代表大会之后，全国各地都举行了群众大会和党员积极分子大会，由参加大会的代表向工人、农民及党员群众传达大会的决议。此外，还以小组形式组织广大群众学习代表大会的文件。各地人民一致表示热烈拥护党的决议，并保证为其彻底实现而坚决奋斗。
    各省、市、工厂、机关企业、农村中的党组织也先后召开会议，讨论贯彻党的代表大会的决议的问题。哥穆尔卡同志曾亲自参加了华沙泽兰汽车工厂党组织的会议，他在会上强调指出，每一个党组织都必需制定实现这次代表大会决议的行动计划。目前华沙各工厂差不多都举行了党的会议，在4月份所有工厂都可定出实现决议的计划。
    革但斯克造船厂党组织和全体职工在讨论了“三大”决议之后，保证完成党所规定的扩大造船计划。托尔诺夫氮肥厂，波兹南船舶发动机工厂以及其他许多大型厂矿都已根据“三大”决议制定了本厂计划。这些计划中都强调了发挥群众积极性，挖掘企业潜力，提高劳动生产率，以完成规定的生产指标和其他任务。

    广大农民也一致拥护党的决议，他们拟订了许多提高农业产量和建设农村的措施。党的第三次代表大会举行以后，农民们还成立了一批新的农业生产合作社。卢布林省和基尔兹省的两个新的农业生产合作社就是以“三大”命名的。
    代表大会以后，要求加入统一工人党的人数显著增加，比得哥煦省和热舒夫省仅在“三大”后的几天内，就各吸收了三百五十名先进工人和农民入党。
