Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: Tokyo News: Kenji Miyamoto, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, published a statement in "Akahata" on April 6th, strongly condemning the Japanese reactionary forces' malicious propaganda regarding the Tibetan rebellion.

Miyamoto pointed out: "The Tibetan issue is entirely China's internal affair." He said that through this rebellion, the Tibetan people have recognized the true face and the end of the imperialist collusion.

Miyamoto pointed out: Contrary to the wishes of the Japanese reactionary forces, all Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, will demonstrate an unprecedented force of unity.

Miyamoto also said that the Tibetan people, under the leadership of the Chinese Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, will further strengthen their unity and move towards the path of democratization and socialist transformation of Tibet.

The Japanese "Akahata" published an editorial on April 8th, pointing out that imperialists dream of using the Tibetan rebellion to separate Tibet from China's territory and place Tibet under their control. They also attempt to take the opportunity to launch anti-China propaganda to undermine China's international credibility, and to sabotage China's friendly relations with India and other Asian countries, as well as the unity of Asian countries.

"Akahata" pointed out that all honest people know that the Tibetan rebellion is entirely a matter of China's internal affairs. The empty and hopeless dreams of the US imperialists, the Nobusuke Kishi government, and the Japanese reactionaries regarding this event will be completely shattered, and will only further isolate the imperialists in the world, while China's friendly relations with neutral Asian countries will be further consolidated.

"Akahata" also published a commentary on April 4th, exposing the past exploitation of the Chinese Tibetan people by Indian capitalists through high-interest loans and the reasons for their pressure on the Indian Parliament. The newspaper said that Indian merchants used to have a privileged position in trade in Tibet. They took advantage of Tibet's location in high mountains with inconvenient transportation, sold daily necessities to Tibetans at arbitrarily determined exchange rates, and purchased Tibetan wool. It is said that Indian merchants made a profit of 300% in cities, and 800% when trading inland. That is to say, in the past, Tibetan commerce was in the hands of lama temples and officials, and Indian merchants shared the profits with them.

"Akahata" said that after the liberation of Tibet, Indian merchants could only make a profit of 3% or 4% from selling goods. It cannot be denied that such merchants have influence on the Indian Parliament.

Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: Jakarta News: After the Tibetan rebellion, the Indonesian "Merdeka" published an editorial entitled "India Busy for Tibet," which said: "For India and other countries, interfering in Tibetan affairs cannot but interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China."

The editorial said that all interference should be prohibited, especially by those Asian and African countries that issued declarations at the Bandung Conference. The editorial added: "Any interference in the Tibetan issue will have far-reaching consequences."

The editorial said that India is very busy with the Tibetan issue, unlike the small country of Nepal, which does not allow others to use it as a "channel" for the Tibetan rebellion. The editorial said that for this reason, it is not surprising that countries around the world, including China, are watching New Delhi's actions.

Another newspaper, "The Indonesian Observer," published an editorial pointing out that although Indian officials said that the Tibetan issue is an internal issue of China, India certainly sympathizes with the rebels.

    干涉西藏事务就是干涉中国内政
    日本进步舆论揭露帝国主义妄想使西藏脱离中国版图
    印度尼西亚报纸指出对西藏进行干涉会引起深远后果
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本共产党总书记宫本显治4月6日在“赤旗报”上发表谈话，强烈谴责日本反动势力恶意宣传西藏叛乱事件。
    宫本指出：“西藏问题完全是中国的内政问题”。他说，西藏人民通过这次叛乱，认识了帝国主义的勾当的真正面目和它们的结局。
    宫本指出：正和日本反动势力的愿望相反，包括西藏人民在内的全体中国人民将显示出空前团结的力量。
    宫本还说，西藏人民将在中国中央人民政府和中国共产党的领导下进一步加强团结，朝着为西藏的民主化和社会主义化的道路前进。
    日本“赤旗报”在4月8日发表社论指出：帝国主义者梦想利用西藏叛乱事件来使西藏脱离中国的版图，并且把西藏置于它们的控制之下。它们还企图趁机展开反对中国的宣传，以便打击中国在国际上的信用，并且企图从中破坏中国同印度和其他亚洲国家的友好关系以及亚洲国家的团结。
    “赤旗报”指出，凡是正直的人都知道，西藏叛乱事件完全属于中国的内政问题。美帝国主义者和岸信介政府以及日本反动派对这个事件所抱的空虚无望的梦想，终会彻底破产，并且只能使帝国主义者在世界上更加陷入孤立状态，而中国同亚洲中立国家的友好关系将更加巩固。
    “赤旗报”在4月4日还刊载了一篇评论，揭露印度资本家过去高利盘剥中国藏族人民的情况以及他们向印度国会施加压力的原因。报纸说，印度的大商人过去曾经在西藏建立了在贸易方面享有特权的地位。他们利用西藏处于丛山峻岭中，交通不便的情况，用任意规定的交换率把日用品卖给西藏人，收买西藏人的羊毛。据说，印度商人在城市获利百分之三百，到内地去做买卖就可以获利百分之八百。这就是说，过去西藏的商业是掌握在喇嘛寺院和官吏的手中的，印度的商人同他们一道享受了利益。
    “赤旗报”说，在西藏解放以后，印度商人出卖商品只能获利3％或者4％。不能否认，这类商人对印度议会是有影响的。
    新华社22日讯　雅加达消息：在西藏叛乱事件发生以后，印度尼西亚“独立报”曾经发表了一篇题为“印度为西藏而忙”的社论，它说：“对于印度和其他国家来说，干涉西藏的事务不可能不干涉中华人民共和国的内政。”
    社论说，禁止进行一切干涉，特别是那些在万隆会议上发表过宣言的亚非国家。社论又说：“对西藏问题进行任何干涉会引起深远的后果。”
    社论说，印度在西藏问题上非常忙，却不像尼泊尔这个小国家，它不让别人利用它作为西藏叛乱的“通道”。社论说，由于这个原因，世界各国，包括中国在内，注视着新德里的行动是不足为奇的。
    另一家报纸“印度尼西亚观察家报”曾经发表社论指出，虽然印度官方说，西藏问题是中国的内部问题，可是印度肯定是同情叛乱分子的。
