    Eliminating Insect Pests
    A Chronicle of the Shanquan People's Commune's Shantian Brigade in Hengshan County Annihilating Rice Paddy Pests
    By Our Correspondent Zhou Rong
    As azaleas bloomed across the mountains and early rice transplanting was about to begin, I visited the Shantian Production Brigade of the Shanquan People's Commune in Hengshan County, Hunan. When I arrived at the brigade, the sun was already setting in the west, and groups of male and female commune members were preparing for transplanting in the fields. A group of commune members were energetically turning over fertilizer ponds. A brigade cadre told me: "This year, our brigade is conducting spring plowing and sowing according to the 'Eight-Point Charter' for agriculture. We are combining various production activities to encircle and suppress insect pests in the early rice paddies. Look!" I looked where he pointed and saw a layer of snow-white quicklime sprinkled in the fertilizer ponds they had just turned over. This was to kill the insect larvae and eggs in the ponds and accelerate fertilizer decomposition. Suddenly, a gust of southern wind blew the glaring white lime. It turned out that the fields in front were being plowed, harrowed, and sprinkled with lime to kill insects simultaneously. I looked around and saw that the field ridges were completely cleared of grass. On the high field ridges that were inaccessible to people, there were also traces of burned firewood. Continuing forward, I arrived at the seedling beds. Three to five moth-attracting lamps were set up in each of three adjacent early red-stem rice seedling beds. The seedlings were more than three inches deep, tender, green, strong, and thick. "Good seedlings!" Commune member Yang Youxin, who was tending the seedlings by the field, smiled and chimed in: "Yes, these seeds are carefully selected, and they were disinfected with salt water and baking soda during soaking to prevent insect damage. When the mother is healthy, the children are strong!" When my gaze shifted from the fields to the edges, I noticed that the field bunds were covered in white lime. He told me this was called "whitening the seedling beds" to prevent moths from other fields from flying to the edges and nesting to breed. Later, I passed many seedling beds, and every one was like this. Some were even better.
    About half a kilometer from the brigade headquarters, I passed a small stream, and the banks of the stream were also bare. After crossing the stream, I ran into brigade leader Cao Qiugao returning from the fields, covered head to toe in mud. He told me that the banks of the stream used to be covered with oily grass, which was a breeding ground for rice weevils. To eliminate the insects, the commune members cut down the grass and used it for firewood. Not far from the stream, I saw a group of children, around thirteen or fourteen years old, holding nets and bamboo baskets, scooping up something in the corners of the fields. I thought they were catching fish. Old Cao quickly said, it wasn't fish, they were scooping up floating debris, which was covered in insect eggs. A piece of debris one inch long could have five to eight insect eggs attached to it.
    When the brigade leader mentioned "rice stubble," I remembered seeing piles of grass ash on the corners of the fields along the way. It turned out that after discovering insect eggs in the rice stubble, the commune members dug up all the stubble and burned it into ash in the corners of the fields.
    The roofs of the thatched houses and pig and cattle sheds were all covered with newly woven rice straw mats. The commune members said that old thatch was a place for insects to overwinter and hatch their eggs, so it was all replaced and burned for firewood. It is said that unsanitary surroundings and piles of garbage also facilitate insect breeding, so the commune members swept away and burned the garbage in front and behind their houses every day.
    The masses have such great determination to eliminate insect pests, such high enthusiasm, and such resolute and thorough actions. I admiringly said to Old Cao: "Brigade leader, you've done a great job in pest control." He modestly said: "Everyone says that to achieve a yield of 2,500 catties per mu, we must eliminate all insects and not let them eat a single grain of rice. Although the insect pests have been basically annihilated now, we still need to continue our efforts to eliminate them completely."
    When discussing the early rice pest control, some cadres and commune members in the brigade enthusiastically recounted the process of annihilating the pests.
    As soon as March arrived, the southern wind began to blow frequently, and the weather was particularly warm. Cao Qiugao, the brigade party branch committee member and team leader, who had thirty years of farming experience, had been somewhat restless these days. Based on his own experience, he judged that because there was little snow last winter and the weather was so warm this spring, there would be particularly many insect pests this year. How could he eliminate the pests as early as possible? He was thinking of ways. He remembered that he had twice raised the issue of large-scale pest control at the end of February, but because he couldn't find any examples to confirm it, it had aroused the resentment of some cadres and the masses. They said: The majority of field banks and ridges were cleared last winter, and the hard fields were also turned over for the winter. There were no insects to control, so we should wait until after transplanting. The issue of pest control was not taken seriously. Old Cao wanted to find examples to educate them this time.
    Chen Aiwu, the commune party secretary, came to the team to inspect the work and agreed with his pest control proposal. One day, the two of them went out to understand the insect breeding situation. Old Cao mentioned that the floating debris in the fields always bites the rice, and Old Chen said that it probably had insects. They grabbed a handful of floating debris from the field, and Old Chen took out a magnifying glass from his pocket and looked at it. Sure enough, there were insects. They immediately called over five old farmers and nine young activists who were working nearby. Everyone looked through the magnifying glass and saw that the floating debris was covered with white, round insect eggs, and a small number of eggs had already hatched into small insects, wagging their heads and tails. After the technician's identification, these were the larvae and eggs of rice stem borers and borers. Several old farmers immediately scooped up more than one hundred catties of floating debris in the field and spread it out on the threshing ground of the Wu Mei Team. At this time, all seven production team leaders and seventeen production squad leaders arrived, and the on-site pest control meeting was held here. At the meeting, no one opposed controlling the insects now. Everyone was eager to try and expressed their determination to eradicate the insect pests. After the production team leader went back and told the masses about it and presented the facts, everyone took action that afternoon and scooped up more than 1,800 catties of floating debris from the fields.
    The next day, the masses further discovered rice planthoppers on the oily grass by the stream, and the eggs and pupae of leafhoppers and borers and other pests were also found on the thatched roofs, in the rice stubble in the spring harvest crop fields, and on the newly grown tender grass on the field ridges.
    These insects have the reproductive ability of "one mother giving birth to a thousand children, and a thousand children giving birth to ten thousand grandchildren," which causes rice paddies to reduce production every year. Last year, a field of 3.6 mu in the Shitai Team was almost completely eaten by insects because it was treated too late. Now, when they see insects, the masses hate them like enemies. They all said: "We must eradicate them as early as possible to ensure a yield of 2,500 catties per mu." From that time on, a movement to comprehensively annihilate rice pests was launched, combining early rice and early-mid rice sowing and various preparatory work. The masses were motivated, their enthusiasm soared, everyone took action, and everyone eliminated insects. Those responsible for sowing the seedling beds disinfected the seeds with salt water and baking soda, and the seedling beds were uniformly "whitened." If there were insects on the rice stubble, oily grass, or newly grown grass, everyone combined it with manure accumulation and quickly pulled it all out and shoveled it away to be burned into ash. Yan Shou had 160 mu of high field ridges that could not be dug. Team leader Peng Jinbang led all the team members to first set fire to burn the thatch, and then erected ladders to shave the ridges clean with knives. If there were insects on the rice straw on the roof, the rice straw from fifty thatched houses was replaced and burned overnight, and new thatched mats were re-covered and sprinkled with lime water to prevent insects. Whether harrowing the fields, plowing the fields, or turning over the ponds, lime was sprinkled and pesticides were applied to kill the insects in the mud. Although the insect pupae hid in the ground, the masses dug them out one by one and fed them to the chickens. Commune member Li Yuying dug up several catties of insect pupae to feed to the chickens. This is how the insects were annihilated.
    After annihilating the current insects and larvae in the fields, the commune members became more vigilant. They said: "Insects have wings and feet, they can fly and walk, and we must be on guard at all times." Because of this, the masses also listed pest control as one of the daily production tasks.

    虫娘虫子一扫光
    衡山县沙泉公社山田大队歼灭稻田虫害纪实
    本报记者　周荣
    在满山盛开着艳山红、早稻插秧就要开始的时候，我访问了湖南衡山县沙泉人民公社的山田生产大队。到达这个大队时，太阳已经偏西，田垅里，成群的男女社员，正在进行着插秧的准备工作。一群社员正在使劲翻肥氹。一个队干部告诉我说：“队里今年搞春耕春播，是根据“八字宪法”进行的。我们正结合各项生产，围剿早稻田间的虫害，你看！我随着他手指的地方看去，在他们刚翻过的肥氹里，撒着一层雪白的生石灰，那是为了杀死氹里的虫娘虫卵，同时加速肥料腐烂。骤然，一阵南风吹来刺眼的白灰，原来前面那几丘田里正在边犁边耙边撒石灰杀虫。我朝四周一望，只见田坎上都刨得光光的，没有一根草。在人不能去的高田坎上，还留有火烧柴草的痕迹。继续往前走，到了秧田边，在一连三丘红脚早秧田里，分别设有三至五盏诱蛾灯。秧苗三寸多深，又嫩又青又壮又粗。“好秧啊！”正在田边护秧的社员阳友新笑着搭上腔来：“是啊，这些谷种都是精选出来的，浸种时又用盐水和小苏打消过毒，没有虫伤，娘胖儿就肥啊！”当我的视线由田中转移到田边时，才发现田塍上撒满了白石灰，他告诉我这叫“秧田白化”，防止外田的虫蛾飞来田边筑窝繁殖。后来，我经过很多秧田，丘丘都是如此。有的比这还好。
    离大队部还有里把路时，经过一条小溪，小溪边上也是光光的。过了溪，正碰上大队长曹秋高从田里回来，满头满身是泥浆。他告诉我，沿溪两岸原来生满了油草，油草是禾老虎产生的温床，为了灭虫，社员便把草割掉做柴烧。过溪走不多远，就看到有一群年约十三、四岁的小朋友，拿着网和竹丝撮箕，正在田角上捞什么。我以为他们在捞鱼。老曹连忙说，不是捞鱼，是捞浮渣屑子，那里面沾满了虫蛋。一寸长的屑子就沾有五至八粒虫蛋。
    大队长提起“禾蔸”，我便想起来路上看到田角上都有堆草灰，原来那是社员们在发现禾蔸里有虫卵后，就把禾蔸全部整了出来，在田角上烧成了灰。
    在茅屋背上和猪牛舍屋背上，盖的全都是用新稻草编扎的茅扇。社员们说，老茅草是虫子过冬和孵卵的场所，都换下去当柴烧掉了。据说，屋的四周不清洁，垃圾杂物多了，也便于害虫繁殖，于是社员们便把屋前屋后的垃圾，天天扫去烧掉。
    群众歼灭虫害的决心这么大，干劲这么足，行动又这样坚决彻底。我钦佩地对老曹说：“大队长，你们除虫工作搞得好。”他谦虚地说：“大家为了实现亩产二千五百斤，都说要除尽虫，不能让虫吃掉一粒谷。现在虫害虽然已经基本被歼灭，但要彻底消灭，还需继续努力。”
    提起这次早稻田间治虫的事，队里面的一些干部和社员都兴致勃勃地讲述他们歼灭虫害的过程。
    刚交3月，南风就经常吹起来，天气格外暖和。有三十年种田经验的大队党总支委员、队长曹秋高，这些天来，有些坐立不安。凭着他自己的经验判断：去冬下雪少，春来天气又这么暖和，今年的虫害会特别多。怎样才能趁早除掉虫害？他在想办法。他记得，在2月末，自己曾二次提过大搞治虫的事，因为没有找到实例来证实，反而引起部分干部和群众的反感。他们说：去冬把多数田墈田塍刨光了，板田也是翻转来过冬的，没有虫可治，插秧后再说。治虫问题终未引起重视。老曹这次就想找实例来教育他们。
    公社党委书记陈爱吾来队检查工作，赞成他的治虫主张。一天，他们两人出去了解虫子繁殖的情况，老曹提起了田里那些浮渣屑子总是咬禾，老陈便说大概是有虫。他们便从田里抓一把浮渣屑子上来，老陈从衣袋里取出放大镜一看，果然有虫。他们立即把在附近做活的五个老农和九个青年积极分子喊来，大家的眼睛透过放大镜，看到浮渣上布满了白圆圆的虫蛋，少数蛋已孵出了小虫，摇头摆尾。经过技术员的鉴定，这正是钻心虫和螟虫的幼虫和卵。几个老农当时就在田里捞了一百多斤浮渣屑子，摊放在五美队禾场上。这时，七个生产队长和十七个生产小队长都来齐了，治虫的现场会就在这里召开。会上，再没有人反对现在治虫了，只见大家摩拳擦掌，表示决心要扑灭虫害。生产队长回去对群众一讲，一摆事实，大家当天下午就行动，一下就在田里捞上了浮渣屑子一千八百多斤。
    第二天，群众又进一步在小溪边发现油草上有稻飞虱，茅屋上、春收作物田里禾蔸上、田墈新生的嫩草上同时发现了浮尘子和螟虫等害虫的卵和蛹。
    这些虫有着“一娘生千子、千子发万孙”的繁殖能力，年年使稻田减产。去年石台队有一丘三亩六分的田，因为治晚了，几乎被虫吃光了。现在一见到虫，群众恨虫如仇敌。都说：“一定要趁早打尽，才能保证亩产二千五百斤。”从那时起，一个结合早稻和早中稻播种的各项准备工作，掀起了全面歼灭稻虫害的运动。群情奋发，干劲冲天，人人动手，个个除虫。负责秧田播种的，把谷种用盐水和小苏打消毒，秧田一律“白化”。禾兜上、油草上和新生的草上有虫，大家结合积肥，迅速就全部拔掉和铲掉烧成灰。延寿有一百六十亩高田墈不能刨，队长彭金榜带领全队社员，先放火把茅草烧掉，然后架楼梯把墈用刀剃光。屋背稻草有虫，只一夜工夫就把五十栋茅屋的稻草换下来烧掉，重新盖上新茅扇，并洒石灰水防虫。耙田犁田翻氹都撒石灰和结合下农药，杀死泥里的虫。虫蛹虽躲在地里，群众把它们一个个挖出来给鸡吃掉。社员李芕英挖了几斤虫蛹给鸡吃。虫，就是这样被歼灭了。
    在歼灭当前田间的虫娘虫子后。社员们更加提高了警觉性。他们说：“虫，有翅又有脚，会飞会走，时刻都要提防。”正因为这样，群众也把治虫列为日常生产任务之一。
