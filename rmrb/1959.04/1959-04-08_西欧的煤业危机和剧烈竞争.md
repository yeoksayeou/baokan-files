The intensification of contradictions within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization stems from the development of the capitalist world's economic crisis. Currently, the economic crisis is gradually spreading from the United States to most Western European countries. The coal industry crisis, being the weakest link in the Western European economy, is the first to stand out. As the coal crisis intensifies, the struggle for markets within the Western European "Coal and Steel Community" group, as well as between this group and Britain and the United States, is becoming increasingly fierce.

    Over the past year, major coal-producing countries such as Britain, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have seen unsold coal piling up higher and higher in open-pit mines, at mine entrances, at train stations, and in coal storage yards. Despite the British government's gradual closure of thirty-six mines since February, Britain's coal stockpiles are still more than ten million tons higher than a year ago. Currently, due to continued decline in consumption, Britain's coal inventory is growing at a rate of 300,000 tons per week. In Belgium, unsold coal is three times the amount of coal in storage a year ago, exceeding a quarter of the annual production. In February, 130,000 Belgian coal miners held a nationwide strike to protest the Belgian government's "emergency" measures to close some so-called "uneconomical" mines and prepare to reduce annual coal production by four million tons. In West Germany, unsold coal in the Ruhr region has also increased from 700,000 tons to 14 million tons. Currently, West Germany's unsold coal and coke are increasing at a rate of 230,000 tons per week.

    This severe development of the Western European coal crisis is the first of its kind since the end of the war. Just over two years ago, Western European countries were still struggling with insufficient coal production to meet the needs of their industries. Britain and West Germany, which had been major coal-exporting countries before the war, imported 2.5% and 5% of their coal consumption from the United States in 1955, respectively. At that time, Italy also imported 44% of its coal consumption from the United States. For Western Europe as a whole, a total of 24 million tons of coal were imported from the United States in 1955 due to the coal shortage, in addition to 4.5 million tons from the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries. In 1956, as the shortage of fuel became even more serious, Western Europe's imports of coal and coke increased to 50 million tons, and in 1957, this number increased again to 52 million tons. The "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community" not only urged its member states to make efforts to increase coal production to cope with the coal shortage but also concluded long-term contracts with the United States for coal imports. However, since 1958, the situation of coal shortages in Western Europe has disappeared.

    What are the reasons for this change? The Western European coal surplus crisis is not caused by increased coal production and imports. In 1958, Britain, the largest coal-producing country in Western Europe, did not increase coal production but rather decreased to the lowest level in ten years. West Germany and France, the two major coal-producing countries on the continent, also produced less coal in 1958 than in 1957, and Belgium's coal production even fell below the level of 1938. As for coal imported by Western Europe, it also decreased by about a quarter (nearly 13 million tons) compared with the previous year. Therefore, the reason for the Western European coal "surplus" can only be found in the end of the Western European industrial upswing cycle and the beginning of the decline in economic activity after 1957.

    Originally, from 1953 onwards, Western European industry experienced a cyclical economic upswing under the conditions of large-scale renewal of fixed capital and the active capitalist world market being conducive to expanding exports. During the five years from 1953 to 1957, the gross national product of Western European countries increased by 40% (the United States only increased by 27%), and the average annual growth rate of industry remained at around 8%. The industrial production of most countries was close to or more than doubled the pre-war level of 1938. With the rise in industrial production, the demand for fuel also greatly increased. However, during this period, Western Europe's coal mining industry basically remained at the pre-war production level, which created a situation of coal shortages in Western Europe. However, with the outbreak of the American economic crisis in the autumn of 1957 and the decline of industry in most Western European countries in the second quarter of 1958, the demand for fuel by the entire Western European industry shrank greatly. Among them, the decline in the production of the steel industry, the largest user of coal, had the greatest impact. According to the estimates of economic experts of the "Coal and Steel Community" group, the reduction in steel production in West Germany and Belgium alone reduced the consumption of coke in Western Europe by three million tons last year. In 1958, in fact, the steel production of all Western European countries except France and the Netherlands was declining. Britain decreased by 10%, West Germany decreased by 7%, Italy decreased by 7.4%, Belgium decreased by 3.3%, Luxembourg decreased by 2.9%..., which caused the demand for coal to shrink in many countries. Take Britain as an example, its domestic market consumption of coal decreased by eight million tons in 1958, while its consumption of coal has been increasing by an average of five or six million tons per year since the war. If Britain is like this, how can other Western European countries be any different.

    Thus, under the pressure of a general "surplus" of coal, all countries have taken emergency measures. While restricting imports of foreign coal, they have lowered coal prices and tried their best to dump coal abroad in order to pass on the crisis to others. Among these, the competition between Britain and West Germany is particularly fierce. For example, in order to expand exports to Western Europe and South America, Britain recently reduced the price of its export coal at British ports by twelve to thirty-nine shillings per ton; however, West Germany is also dumping coal at reduced prices, thus frustrating Britain's plans. Recently, after the British National Coal Board had just agreed to supply Portugal with 40,000 tons of cheap coal, the coal owners in the Ruhr region of West Germany suggested to Portugal that they were willing to provide the same amount of coal at an even lower price, which again caused Britain to lose a deal that was already in hand. In the French market, the strong competition from West Germany will also reduce Britain's coal exports to France from 600,000 tons last year to 300,000 tons this year. Britain is not only being squeezed out of the European market by West Germany, but even as far away as Argentina in South America, Britain is losing its market. Last year, the Buenos Aires Electric Company in the capital of Argentina was supplied with 200,000 tons of coal by Britain, but this year, these 200,000 tons of coal will be supplied by the United States and West Germany with cheaper coal.

    Within the Western European "Coal and Steel Community" group, due to the provision of "free circulation of coal and steel," the capitalist-style "free competition" of the big fish eating the small fish is carried out more cruelly. The coal mining industries of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, with their thin capital and backward equipment, were unable to support themselves under the fierce competition from the powerful coal mining industries of West Germany and France with their modernized equipment. Although Belgium tried hard to lower coal prices by 5% in February, it still could not compete with its powerful opponents. Its coal inventory has exceeded a quarter of its annual production, and there has been a large number of mine closures and worker unemployment in the country, but even so, it is estimated that West Germany will export at least three million tons of coal to Belgium this year, and the Netherlands will export one million tons of coal to Belgium. Belgium had to issue an emergency appeal to the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community," requesting to declare a "state of crisis": implement quota production in the six countries, and restrict coal imports from other member states. However, this appeal was opposed by France and West Germany, except for the support of the two small countries of Luxembourg and the Netherlands. France, which does not have a very serious coal crisis, is simply unwilling to reduce production to import unemployment and harm the interests of French capitalists. After restricting coal imports from the United States and Britain, West Germany is unwilling to excessively reduce production to reduce its competitiveness. Italy, which has very little coal production, is unwilling to declare a "state of crisis" in order to continue to rely on cheap American coal to reduce industrial production costs and strengthen export competitiveness, and is trying its best to advocate further lowering Western European coal prices.

    Under these circumstances of discord and fierce competition, the internal disputes of the "Coal and Steel Community" group have intensified. In February, Belgium requested the group to declare a "state of crisis" for coal and threatened to withdraw from the group. However, this request was rejected by the Council of Ministers of the "Coal and Steel Community" group on March 2, on the pretext that if "a 'state of crisis' is declared, it will disintegrate the group." However, two days later, on March 5, after a ten-hour meeting, the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community" group decided to declare that a "clear state of crisis" had appeared in the Western European coal market. However, on March 23, at the Council of Ministers of the group, this decision was vetoed due to the opposition of West Germany and France. During this period, West Germany protested against Belgium for not issuing import licenses for West German coal, believing that this was an action that violated the coalition agreement. In a situation where contradictions could not be resolved, the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community" group recently painstakingly drafted a plan outline for the unified management of the group's coal mining industry, the main contents of which include: (1) The six countries of the "Coal and Steel Community" jointly formulate trade policies to restrict coal imports; (2) Freeze coal inventories at the current level; (3) Use a "flexible" principle to regulate production.

    However, as soon as this plan was put forward, it was met with principled opposition from West Germany, which believed that this was a kind of "supernational control." France deliberately adopted a "reserved" attitude, saying that it would not express its attitude until it saw the details of the plan. Italy, which relies on imported coal to supply domestic consumption, put forward its unique conditions: it would only agree to restrict foreign coal imports if Western European coal prices were reduced. It is extremely ironic that only the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg opposed "going their own way." These small countries pointed out that in dealing with the coal crisis, relying on the entire group is more effective than relying on individual countries to fight. Originally, they were afraid that the strong competition from West Germany and France would cause their domestic coal mining industries to bear the entire burden of the crisis. However, these small countries' proposals for unitedly dealing with the crisis are of no avail. Because the "Coal and Steel Community" group has stipulated that any major decision must obtain the consent of West Germany or France, whose coal production in the group exceeds 20%; that is to say, nothing can be done without their approval.

    While some large countries in Western Europe are bullying small countries and engaging in the big fish eating the small fish in the coal market competition, their situation is like "the mantis stalking the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind," and they have encountered strong competition from across the Atlantic. Washington, which has always regarded the Western European market as a lifeline for the dying American coal mining industry since the end of the war, had already encouraged Western Europe to establish a "Coal and Steel Community" in 1952 in order to gradually transport 60% of its exported coal to Western Europe. In 1956, the American "Fortune" magazine frankly pointed out that in the two years of 1954 and 1955, the American coal mining industry, which had been in a slump, was able to increase coal production by 27% precisely by relying on exporting a large amount of coal to Western Europe. In 1956, the United States exported 37.3 million tons of coal to Western Europe. In 1957, it increased to 43.3 million tons. Last year, even when coal stockpiles in Western Europe were piling up like mountains, the United States still exported 11.6 million tons of coal to West Germany, 6 million tons of coal to Italy (Italy only imported a total of 7.5 million tons of coal that year), 3.5 million tons of coal to the Netherlands, and 2.8 million tons of coal to France, and 1.8 million tons of coal to Belgium. In this year, Britain exported a total of only 1.6 million tons of coal to the six countries of the "Coal and Steel Community". It is estimated that the total amount of coal exported by West Germany to the "Coal and Steel Community" countries is only about 20 million tons.

    The United States not only dumps "surplus" coal to Western Europe in quantities overwhelming West Germany and Britain, but it also seizes Western Europe's future coal market by concluding long-term coal supply contracts. For example, West Germany is currently required to import 40 million tons of coal from the United States according to the contract. If West Germany cancels this contract, it must pay significant compensation fees, and when West Germany decides to reduce the free import quota for American coal and impose a tariff of $4.76 per ton of imported coal from February 16; at the same time, when the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community" group is also planning to restrict coal imports from outside, the United States not only threatens West Germany, but also the collective, saying that if Western European countries want to restrict the import of American coal, the United States will cut aid to Western Europe, and will also boycott the import of small cars and Western European machinery and steel products from West Germany, Italy, and France to retaliate.

    This fierce market battle surrounding the "surplus" crisis of coal will promote the trend of the disintegration of the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries and intensify the trade war between North America and Western Europe.

    As early as February this year, the Paris "International Forum" weekly pointed out in an article entitled "The Coal and Steel Community Crisis Foreshadows the Disintegration of the 'Common Market'" that the "Coal and Steel Community" group is a very fragile tool. It has been able to exist because the supply of coal in Western Europe has been in short supply and prices have been rising continuously since the end of the war. Since the existence of the "Coal and Steel Community" and the "Common Market" has intensified market competition and the crisis, this situation will reverse to promote their own disintegration. The French "Echoes" newspaper pointed out more sharply: "The 'Common Market' actually does not work in the peak season, and cannot withstand the test during an economic recession."

    The countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are thus engaging in a mixed battle of trying to drown each other in the face of shrinking markets. As this mixed battle intensifies, the various institutions they have painstakingly established will move from shaking to collapsing. (Attached picture)

    西欧的煤业危机和剧烈竞争
    张振亚
    北大西洋联盟内部矛盾日益尖锐化的根源之一，是资本主义世界经济危机的发展。现在经济危机正在从美国逐渐波及西欧大多数国家，其中首先突出地表现出来的是西欧经济部门中最薄弱环节的煤矿业的过剩危机。随着煤业危机的加剧，西欧“煤钢联营”集团内部以及这个集团同英国、美国之间争夺市场的斗争也日益激化。
    一年来，主要产煤国家如英国、西德、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡，销售不出去的煤，在露天矿场、煤坑口、火车站和储煤站堆积得越来越高。英国政府尽管从2月份起已开始陆续关闭三十六个矿井，英国的存煤比一年前仍然多一千多万吨。目前由于消费继续萎缩，英国的煤的存货量在以每周三十万吨的速度继续增长。在比利时，销售不出去的煤等于一年前煤存量的三倍，超过年产量的四分之一。比利时的十三万煤矿工人在2月份举行了全国性罢工，反对比利时政府封闭一部分所谓“不经济”的矿井和准备把煤的年产量减少四百万吨的“紧急”措施。在西德，鲁尔区销售不出去的煤也从七十万吨增加到一千四百万吨。目前西德销售不出去的煤和焦炭在以每周二十三万吨的速度在增长。
    西欧煤业危机的这种严重发展，是战后以来第一次出现的。两年多以前，西欧各国还在为产煤量不足供应它的工业需求而苦恼。英国、西德这两个战前一直是大量出口煤的国家，1955年分别从美国输入它们所消费的2.5％和5％的煤。当时意大利也从美国输入它所消费的44％的煤。从整个西欧来说，1955年由于煤的供不应求，总共从美国输入了二千四百万吨煤，此外还从苏联和东欧社会主义国家输入了四百五十万吨。1956年由于动力燃料的缺乏更趋严重，西欧煤和焦炭的入口量增加到五千万吨，到1957年这一数字再增加到五千二百万吨。“煤钢联营”集团的“高级机构”为应付煤荒不仅竭力敦促它的成员国努力增加煤的产量，而且还同美国订立了进口煤的长期合同。可是，从1958年起，西欧煤的供不应求情况消失了。
    造成这个变化的原因何在呢？西欧煤的过剩危机，并不是由于煤的产量和进口量增加所形成的。在1958年，西欧最大的产煤国英国的煤产量不是增加、而是下降到十年来的最低水平，西德和法国这两个大陆主要产煤国1958年的煤产量也低于1957年，比利时的煤产量甚至落到1938年的水平以下。至于西欧进口的煤，也比前一年减少了约四分之一（近一千三百万吨）。因此，西欧煤的
  “过剩”原因，只能从1957年以后西欧工业上升周期的结束，经济活动的开始下降中去找。
    原来，从1953年起，西欧工业在大量更新固定资本和资本主义世界市场活跃有利于扩大出口的条件下，曾经出现了一个周期性经济上升。在1953年到1957年的五年中，西欧国家的国民生产总值增加了40％（美国只增加了27％），工业每年平均上升速度保持在8％左右。大多数国家的工业生产都接近或超过战前1938年水平的一倍。在工业生产的上升的同时，对燃料的需求也大大增加。可是，在这段时期内，西欧的采煤业却基本上仍然停留于战前的生产水平，这就造成了西欧煤的供不应求现象。但是随着1957年秋美国经济危机的爆发和西欧大多数国家的工业在1958年第二季度中都转趋下降，于是整个西欧工业对燃料的需求就大大萎缩。其中尤以煤的最大用户炼钢工业生产的下降造成的影响最大。根据“煤钢联营”集团经济专家的估计，去年仅是西德和比利时钢铁工业的减产，就使西欧焦炭的消费量减少了三百万吨。而1958年除了法国和荷兰以外，实际上西欧所有国家的钢产量都在下降。英国下降了10％，西德下降了7％，意大利下降了7.4％，比利时下降了3.3％，卢森堡下降了2.9％……，这就造成许多国家对煤的需求缩减。以英国为例，1958年它的国内市场对煤的消费量就减少了八百万吨，而战后以来它对煤的消费却一向每年平均增加五、六百万吨。英国如此，其他西欧国家又何独不然。
    于是，在煤的普遍“过剩”的压力下，所有国家就都采取了应急措施。它们在限制外煤进口的同时，压低煤价，竭力向国外倾销，以便把危机转嫁给他人。在这当中，英国和西德的竞争尤为激烈。例如英国为了扩大向西欧和南美的出口，不久前把它的出口煤在英国各港口的起岸价格每公吨削减十二到三十九先令；但是西德也在削价倾销，因此使英国的计划受到挫折。最近英国国家煤业局刚答应供给葡萄牙四万吨廉价煤，西德鲁尔区的煤业主就向葡萄牙建议，愿意以更低的价格提供同数量的煤，这样又使英国失掉了一笔已经到手的买卖。在法国市场上，西德的强烈竞争，也将使今年英国向法国输出的煤由去年的六十万吨减为三十万吨。英国不仅在欧洲的市场受到西德的排挤，甚至远在南美的阿根廷，英国也在失掉它的市场。阿根廷首都的布宜诺斯艾利斯电力公司去年曾由英国供应了二十万吨煤，但是今年这二十万吨煤却由美国和西德以更廉价的煤来供应了。
    在西欧“煤钢联营”集团内部，由于有“煤钢自由流通”的规定，因此资本主义式的大鱼吃小鱼的“自由竞争”就进行得更加残酷无情。资本单薄、设备落后的比利时、卢森堡和荷兰的采煤业，在西德和法国现代化设备的强大采煤业的激烈竞争下，终于无法支持。比利时尽管在2月份努力把煤价压低了5％，可是仍然无法同它的强大对手竞争。它的存煤量已超过年产量的四分之一，国内出现了大量矿井倒闭，工人失业的现象，但是尽管如此，预计今年西德至少将向比利时输出三百万吨煤，荷兰则将向比利时输出一百万吨煤。比利时不得不向“煤钢联营”集团的“高级机构”发出救急呼吁，要求宣布“危机状态”：在六国中实行限额生产，并限制其他成员国煤的进口。但是这一呼吁，除了获得卢森堡和荷兰两个小国的支持以外，却遭到法国和西德的反对。煤业危机不十分严重的法国根本不愿缩减产量来输入失业，并损害法国资本家的利益。西德在限制了美国和英国的煤进口之后，已不愿过度缩减产量来减少竞争能力。煤产量极少的意大利为了继续依靠廉价的美国煤来降低工业生产成本，加强出口竞争能力，也不赞成宣布“危机状态”，而竭力主张进一步降低西欧煤价。
    在这种同床异梦、竞争激烈的情况下，“煤钢联营”集团内部的纷争更为激化了。比利时在2月间曾要求这个集团宣布煤的“危机状态”，并以退出集团相要挟。但这个要求被3月2日
  “煤钢联营”集团的部长理事会拒绝了，借口是如果“宣布‘危机状态’会使这个集团瓦解”。可是过了两天，3月5日，“煤钢联营”集团的“高级机构”在开了一次长达十小时的会议之后，又决定宣布：西欧煤炭市场已出现“明显的危机状态”。不过，3月23日，在该集团的部长理事会上，这个决定又因受西德、法国的反对，而被否决了。在这期间，西德曾因比利时不发西德煤的入口证而提出抗议，认为这是破坏联营协定的行动。在矛盾无法解决的情况下，“煤钢联营”集团的“高级机构”最近又煞费苦心地草拟了一个统一管理本集团煤矿业的计划大纲，其内容主要包括：（一）由“煤钢联营”六国协同制定贸易政策来限制煤的入口；（二）把存煤冻结在目前的水平上；（三）用一项“富于弹性”的原则来调节生产。
    可是这个计划一提出，就遭到西德的原则性反对，认为这是一种“超国家的控制”。法国故意采取了“保留”态度，说要等看到计划的细节后才表示态度。依靠入口煤来供应国内消费的意大利则提出了它的独特条件：只有西欧煤减价它才同意限制外煤入口。具有绝顶讽刺意味的是，反对“各行其是”的只有荷、比、卢三国。这些小国指出，在应付煤业危机方面，依靠整个集团要比依靠单个国家奋斗更有效果。原来它们害怕西德和法国的强烈竞争会使它们本国的煤矿业承受全部危机的重担。不过，这些小国的这类团结应付危机的主张，却无济于事。因为“煤钢联营”集团曾规定，凡有重大决定必须取得本集团内产煤量超过20％的西德或法国的首肯；这就是说，没有它们的点头，什么都行不通。
    当西欧的一些大国在煤的市场竞争上，欺凌弱小国家，进行大鱼吃小鱼的时候，它们的处境却像“螳螂捕蝉，黄雀在后”一样，遭到了大西洋对岸的强烈竞争。战后以来一直把西欧市场当作美国奄奄待毙的煤矿业的救生圈的华盛顿，早在1952年就怂恿西欧建立“煤钢联营”，以便逐渐把它出口的60％的煤运往西欧。1956年美国“幸福”杂志曾坦白指出，在1954年和1955年两年中，一蹶不振的美国煤矿业正是依靠了向西欧输出大量的煤才得以把煤产量提高了27％。1956年美国向西欧输出了三千七百三十万吨煤。1957年又增加到四千三百三十万吨。去年甚至在西欧存煤堆积如山的情况下，美国还向西德输出了一千一百六十万吨煤，向意大利输出了六百万吨煤（意大利在这一年一共才输入煤七百五十万吨），荷兰三百五十万吨煤，法国二百八十万吨煤，比利时一百八十万吨煤。而在这一年，英国向“煤钢联营”六国输出的煤一共才有一百六十万吨。西德向“煤钢联营”国家输出煤的总量估计也只有两千万吨左右。
    美国不仅以压倒西德和英国的数量，向西欧倾销“过剩”的煤，它还通过订立长期供煤合同来侵占西欧未来的煤市场。例如目前根据合同西德就必须从美国输入四千万吨煤。如果西德取消这项合同，就必须付出重大的赔偿费，而当西德决定缩小美国煤的自由进口限额，并从2月16日起对每吨进口煤课以四·七六美元的关税；同时“煤钢联营”集团的“高级机构”也在计划限制外煤入口的时候，美国就不仅向西德，而且也向这个集体提出了恫吓，说西欧国家如果要限制美国煤的入口，美国就要削减对西欧的援助，并且还要抵制西德、意大利和法国小型汽车和西欧的机器制品和钢材的入口，来进行报复。
    这种围绕着煤的“过剩”危机而展开的一场激烈的市场争夺战，将促成西欧六国“共同市场”瓦解的趋势，并加剧北美和西欧之间的贸易战。
    早在今年2月，巴黎“国际论坛”周刊在一篇题为“煤钢联营危机预示‘共同市场’的瓦解”的文章中就指出，“煤钢联营”集团是一个非常脆弱的工具，它之所以能够存在是因为战后西欧的煤一直供不应求，价格不断上涨。而这次既然“煤钢联营”和“共同市场”的存在加剧了市场竞争和危机景象，因此，这种情况就会反转来促进它们自身的瓦解。法国“回声报”更一针见血地指出：“‘共同市场’实际上是，在旺季时不起作用，在经济衰退时就经不起考验”。
    北大西洋集团国家就这样地在市场日益萎缩下，进行着要把对方淹死的混战。随着这种混战的激烈化，它们所煞费苦心建立起来的各种机构也将由动摇而走向崩裂。（附图片）
