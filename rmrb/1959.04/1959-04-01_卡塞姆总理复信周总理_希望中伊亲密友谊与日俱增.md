Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, March 30th: Prime Minister Qasim wrote a letter to Premier Zhou Enlai today, replying to Premier Zhou's letter that was delivered to him through Bao Erhan, the head of the Chinese cultural delegation visiting Iraq.

In his letter, Qasim said that after the July 14th Revolution freed us from chains and obstacles, I am as pleased as you are with the rapid progress of political and economic relations between our two countries, and I hope that close friendship and mutually beneficial exchanges will grow day by day. The chains and obstacles of the past prevented us from establishing friendly relations with all peace-loving countries.

Qasim said that I am particularly pleased that during the visit of your cultural delegation to Iraq, we announced our complete withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact. We did this in accordance with the wishes of the people and in accordance with the foreign policy of the Republic.

Qasim said that I do not need to talk about the friendly and admiring feelings of the Iraqi people for the great Chinese people and their brilliant achievements, because your cultural delegation will tell you how much respect and friendly attitude the Iraqi people have expressed towards the Chinese people. Qasim also mentioned in his letter that there has been friendship and economic and cultural relations between China and Iraq since ancient times. Qasim expressed his hope that the great Chinese people will have happiness, success, progress and prosperity.

    卡塞姆总理复信周总理
    希望中伊亲密友谊与日俱增
    新华社巴格达30日电　卡塞姆总理今天写信给周恩来总理，答复周总理托中国访问伊拉克文化代表团团长包尔汉转交给他的信。
    卡塞姆在信中说，在7月14日的革命使我们摆脱了锁链和障碍以后，我对于我们两国之间的政治和经济关系的迅速进展同你一样地感到高兴，并且希望亲密的友谊和互利的交往与日俱增。过去的锁链和障碍使我们不能同一切爱好和平的国家建立友好关系。
    卡塞姆说，我特别感到高兴的是，在你们的文化代表团访问伊拉克期间，我们宣布完全退出巴格达条约，我们这样做是符合人民的愿望的，也是符合共和国的外交政策的。
    卡塞姆说，我不必谈到伊拉克人民对伟大的中国人民和他们的光辉成就所怀抱的友好和钦佩的心情，因为你们的文化代表团将会告诉你们伊拉克人民对中国人民表示了怎样的尊敬和友好态度。卡塞姆在信中还谈到中伊两国自古以来就存在着友谊和经济、文化关系。卡塞姆表示，他希望伟大的中国人民幸福、成功、进步和繁荣。
