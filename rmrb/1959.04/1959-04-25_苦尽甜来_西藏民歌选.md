After Suffering Comes Sweetness
—Selected Tibetan Folk Songs

	The Brightest North Star

	Hada doesn't need to be numerous,
	Just one pure white one will do;
	Friends don't need to be many,
	Just knowing one Liberation Army soldier is enough,
	Then my heart,
	Will be like a blossoming flower.
	Though there are many stars in the sky,
	Only the North Star shines brightest;
	Though the people on earth are dense,
	Only the Communist Party and the Liberation Army are best.

	Though the Rabbit's Feet are Short

	Though the antlers of the deer are long,
	They can't reach the blue sky.
	Though the rabbit's feet are short,
	It can run all over the mountains and plains.
	Though the Tibetan people have suffered,
	As long as they are under the leadership of the Communist Party,
	They can change the world.

	With the Communist Party, Bitter Turns to Sweet

	The Himalayas may be high, but they have a top,
	The Lancang River may be long, but it has a source,
	No matter how deep the suffering of the Tibetan people,
	With the Communist Party, bitterness turns to sweetness.

	Under the Leadership of the Communist Party

	Tibet is a good place,
	Various treasures are hidden underground,
	Gold, silver, copper, iron, everything is there,
	Cattle and sheep cover the mountains.
	Tibet is Chinese territory,
	Tibetans and Han are like children of the same parents,
	Under the leadership of the Communist Party,
	Everyone is liberated.
	We must actively support the Liberation Army,
	Support the Communist Party,
	Let the bandits be afraid to see our unity as steel.

	The Motherland's Territory - Tibet

	Tibet is the motherland's frontier,
	Reactionary elements are not allowed to lie,
	The new construction after liberation,
	Brings auspiciousness to the Tibetan people.

	The Five-Starred Red Flag

	The clouds gently kiss the mountains,
	The five-starred red flag flutters on the peaks,
	The Party and Chairman Mao,
	Are the sun of happiness on earth.

	The Glorious Communist Party

	The towering snow-capped mountains are smiling,
	The green and lush lawns are applauding,
	The little shepherd is singing loudly—
	Great Chairman Mao,
	Glorious Communist Party.

	Our Liberation Army is Here

	The tears of past years cannot be exhausted,
	The mountain songs of this year cannot be finished,
	Our People's Liberation Army is here,
	Parting the dark clouds to see the blue sky.

    苦尽甜来
    ——西藏民歌选
    北斗星最亮
    哈达不要多，
    只要一条洁白的就行；
    朋友不要太多，
    能结识一个解放军就好，
    那时我的心呀，
    就会像开放的鲜花一样。
    天上的星星虽多，
    只有北斗星最亮；
    地上的人虽稠密，
    只有共产党和解放军最好。
    兔脚虽短
    鹿角再长，
    却顶不上青天。
    兔脚虽短，
    能跑遍高山平原。
    藏胞虽苦，
    只要在共产党领导下，
    就能改地换天。
    共产党来了苦变甜
    喜马拉雅山再高也有顶，
    澜沧江再长也有源，
    藏族人民的痛苦再深，
    共产党来了苦尽甘来。
    在共产党的领导下
    西藏是个好地方，
    各种宝贝地下藏，
    金银铜铁样样有，
    牛羊遍山岗。
    西藏是中国的土地，
    藏汉如同一个爹娘，
    在共产党的领导下，
    大家得到解放。
    我们要积极支援解放军，
    拥护共产党，
    让强盗害怕地看见我们团结如钢。
    祖国的领土——西藏
    西藏是祖国的边疆，
    不许反动分子撒谎，
    解放后的新建设，
    给藏族人民带来了吉祥。
    五星红旗
    云霭低吻着山峦，
    五星红旗在山峰飘荡，
    党和毛主席呀，
    是人间幸福的太阳。
    光荣的共产党
    高耸入云的雪山在微笑，
    绿得发茵的草坪在鼓掌，
    小牧童在高声歌唱——
    伟大的毛主席，
    光荣的共产党。
    来了我们解放军
    往年的眼泪流不尽，
    今年的山歌唱不完，
    来了我们的人民解放军，
    拨开乌云见青天。
