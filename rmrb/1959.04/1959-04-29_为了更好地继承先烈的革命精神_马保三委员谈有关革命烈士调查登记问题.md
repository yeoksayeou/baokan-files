To better inherit the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs,

CPPCC Member Ma Bao San Discusses the Investigation and Registration of Revolutionary Martyrs

I fully support Premier Zhou's government work report and the various reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

Now, I would like to offer a suggestion regarding the investigation and registration of revolutionary martyrs. Recently, during my brief visits to Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces, I felt that this is a very important task. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, our people have defeated imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, established the People's Republic of China, successfully completed the First Five-Year Plan for economic construction, and entered the even more magnificent Second Five-Year Plan period. In 1958, based on the victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, China experienced an unprecedented great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. This is very exciting and worthy of our great celebration. However, we deeply know that the achievement of this series of great victories was not easy. It was not only achieved by the efforts of those of us who are alive but also by the countless revolutionary martyrs who exchanged their blood and heads for it. Since the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921, especially in the decades from 1927, when the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group betrayed the Chinese revolution, until the national liberation, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, experienced the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, namely, the War of Liberation. During these arduous revolutionary struggles, the people's army and the broad masses of workers, peasants, progressive youth, and other patriotic people, under the leadership of the Party, advanced wave upon wave, struggled arduously, shed blood, and sacrificed themselves, finally achieving the victory of the revolution and opening up the path for our socialist construction. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao Zedong attach great importance to the great achievements of the revolutionary martyrs. In 1949, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference decided to build a monument to the people's heroes in Tiananmen Square in our capital. Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in our country, personally broke ground for the monument to the people's heroes. Under the attention of the central government, in recent years, governments at all levels have vigorously organized the investigation of the deeds of revolutionary martyrs to commend their great achievements, investigated many martyrs' deeds during their lifetimes, and established many revolutionary martyrs' cemeteries, memorial halls, monuments, etc. throughout the country. These great achievements of the revolutionary martyrs have become practical teaching materials for educating the people in socialism and communism, and they have played a great role in educating the people of the whole country to raise their socialist consciousness and accelerate socialist construction. However, since our country is a vast country with a population of 600 million, the environments in which the various revolutionary historical stages were situated were different, and the years have been long, the deeds of many revolutionary martyrs have been lost. Therefore, although a large number of historical materials of revolutionary martyrs have been investigated and sorted out in the past, it is still not universal and perfect enough. In order to educate the people of the whole country to inherit the selfless revolutionary spirit of the martyrs and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, it is necessary to investigate the deeds of the martyrs in various revolutionary historical periods as soon as possible. Therefore, I suggest that all parts of the country seize the time to universally investigate and register the deeds of revolutionary martyrs. As time goes by, it will be even more difficult to investigate. In the Land Revolution War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, all the officers and soldiers who sacrificed for the revolution, local Party, government, and mass cadres, militiamen, and civilian workers who supported the front, as well as other patriotic people who sacrificed for the revolutionary cause, as long as the people generally recognize them as martyrs, should be investigated and registered. How to conduct the investigation? Based on past experience, governments at all levels can absorb relevant personnel to form a revolutionary martyrs investigation committee, which is organized by the civil affairs departments of governments at all levels and is specifically responsible for the investigation of revolutionary martyrs by the bureau of preferential treatment, local chronicles offices, historical societies, cultural and historical museums, and CPPCC members with the conditions. Led by the civil affairs departments at all levels, no additional organizational structures are set up. The province should uniformly formulate a revolutionary martyrs investigation and registration form and distribute it to the people's communes for reproduction in the same way, designating special personnel to be responsible for investigating and registering the revolutionary martyrs in each commune, and completing the investigation and registration of the martyrs who sacrificed in each revolutionary stage in this commune, as well as their merits and the time and place of their sacrifice, at one time. Three copies of the registration form should be made, one each for the commune, the county, and the province. In this way, the commune, county, and province can compile the revolutionary martyrs' history of the entire commune, county, or province based on these materials. In order to better educate the entire people with the deeds of the revolutionary martyrs, in addition to building revolutionary martyrs' cemeteries, monuments, and memorial halls in some towns or major war areas by the province and county, the most important thing is to establish revolutionary martyrs' memorial halls at the production brigade or people's commune level, using scrolls or pictures to record the brief deeds of the revolutionary martyrs in this production brigade or commune on scrolls or pictures, and displaying them regularly or irregularly in the martyrs' memorial hall for the masses to admire, so as to never forget. According to the habits of the masses, hold one or two gatherings each year (such as Qingming Festival and Spring Festival) to mourn the martyrs, with special personnel responsible for introducing the deeds of the revolutionary martyrs to the masses. This will not only comprehensively commend the great achievements of the revolutionary martyrs but also enlighten the broad masses of the people to remember where their happiness comes from, better raise their socialist consciousness, inherit the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, muster greater revolutionary enthusiasm, and accelerate the construction of our happy and beautiful socialism and communism. This suggestion is for reference, and I wish the conference success and all members good health.

    为了更好地继承先烈的革命精神
    马保三委员谈有关革命烈士调查登记问题
    我完全拥护周总理所做的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席所做的各项报告。
    现在我仅就有关革命烈士调查登记问题提一点建议。关于这个问题，最近我在湖南、江西等省走马观花的参观、访问中，感到是一件非常重要的工作。我国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，打垮了帝国主义和国民党反动派，建立了中华人民共和国，胜利的完成了第一个五年经济建设计划并进入更加宏伟的第二个五年经济建设计划时期，我国一九五八年在整风反右胜利的基础上出现了史无前例的工农业生产大跃进，这是十分令人兴奋和值得我们大大庆贺的。但是，我们深知这一系列的伟大胜利的取得并非是容易的，它不仅是我们活着的人们的努力取得的，而且也是千千万万的革命先烈，用热血和头颅换来的。自一九二一年中国共产党成立以来，特别是在一九二七年蒋介石反动集团背叛中国革命以后到全国解放的几十年的漫长岁月里，全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，经历了第二次国内革命战争，抗日战争，和第三次国内革命战争，即解放战争，在这几个艰苦的革命斗争时期，人民的军队和广大的工人、农民、进步青年以及其他爱国人士，在党的领导下，前仆后继，艰苦奋斗，流血牺牲，终于取得了革命的胜利，开辟了我们进行社会主义建设的道路。党中央和毛主席对革命先烈的丰功伟迹是非常重视的，一九四九年中国人民政治协商会议第一次会议决定在我们的首都天安门广场建立人民英雄纪念碑，我国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自为人民英雄纪念碑破土奠基。在中央的重视下，几年来各级人民政府为表彰革命先烈的丰功伟迹，大力的组织了对革命烈士事迹的调查工作，调查出了许多烈士生前的事迹，并在全国各地建立了许多革命烈士陵园、纪念堂、纪念碑等等。这些革命先烈的丰功伟迹，成了对人民进行社会主义、共产主义教育的实际教材，它在教育全国人民提高社会主义觉悟，加速社会主义建设方面起了很大的推动作用。但由于我国是一个域图广阔的六亿人口的大国，各个革命历史阶段所处的环境又不同，以及年代久远，许多革命烈士的事迹失传了，因此，过去虽然已经调查整理了大批革命烈士的历史资料，但仍不够普遍和完善。为了教育全国人民继承先烈忘我的革命精神，多快好省地建设社会主义，普遍的把各个革命历史时期的烈士事迹早日调查清楚是有必要的。因此，我建议全国各地抓紧对革命烈士的事迹普遍调查登记。日久年延，时过境迁，就更不好调查了。在土地革命战争、抗日战争、解放战争中，凡是为革命牺牲的将士，地方党政群干部、民兵和支前民工以及为革命事业牺牲的其他爱国人士，只要人民群众公认是烈士的，都应进行调查登记。如何进行调查？根据过去的经验，各级政府可吸收有关方面人员组成革命烈士调查委员会，由各级政府的民政部门负责组织优抚局、地方志办公室、史学会、文史馆和有条件的政协委员，具体负责革命烈士的调查工作，由各级民政部门领导，不增设编制机构。由省统一制定革命烈士调查登记表样，发给人民公社照样翻印，指定专人负责调查登记各社的革命烈士，把本公社在各个革命阶段牺牲的烈士及其功绩和牺牲地点时间一次调查登记完毕。登记表一式三份，社、县、省各一份。这样，社、县、省即可根据这些材料编制全社、全县或全省的革命烈士史册。为了更好的用革命先烈们的事迹教育全体人民，除在一些城镇或主要战争地区，由省、县修建革命烈士陵园、纪念碑、纪念堂之外，最重要的是以生产大队或人民公社为单位，设立革命烈士纪念堂，采用卷轴或图片等形式，把本生产大队或公社的革命烈士简略事迹登诸卷轴或图片，定期或不定期的陈列在烈士纪念堂里，供群众瞻仰，以志永矢不忘。根据群众的习惯，每年举行一、二次（如清明、春节）悼念烈士的集会，由专人负责向群众作革命烈士事迹的介绍，这样不仅全面的表彰了革命先烈的丰功伟绩，而且启发广大人民饮水思源，更好的提高社会主义觉悟，继承先烈们的革命精神，鼓足更大的革命干劲，加速建设我们幸福美好的社会主义和共产主义。这个建议供作参考，并祝大会成功和各位委员身体健康。
