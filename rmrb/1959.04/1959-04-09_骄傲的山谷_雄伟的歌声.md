    Proud Valley, Majestic Song
    Li Ling
  Last year, we congratulated the great peace fighter and talented black singer Paul Robeson on his sixtieth birthday with reverence and enthusiasm. This year, on the eve of Robeson's sixty-first birthday, Chinese audiences have enjoyed his early film "Proud Valley." With his superb and simple acting skills, he created an unforgettable image of a worker; his deep and majestic singing voice has deeply moved us.
    Looking at the powerful, burly body on the screen, the swarthy face, and the kind, mellow smile, one feels that Robeson is not acting, but living realistically and participating in actual struggle steadfastly. Listening to his singing and thinking of his background and his noble thoughts, our love and respect for him becomes even stronger.
    The film "Proud Valley" depicts the struggle of miners in South Wales, Britain, during World War II, to fight for their right to work and live, and to oppose fascism.
    Robeson plays David, an unemployed worker. David goes to a remote valley to find work. He is a talented miner with a gift for singing. Unable to find work, he busks with a tramp. He is discovered by Dick, the conductor of the coal mine choir, who invites him to join their choir and finds him a job.
    David is an upright and brave man, and he respects Dick very much. When Dick is killed in an accident in the mine, David rushes in and carries Dick out, but Dick dies from his injuries. Dick's family has lost their pillar, David has lost a respected friend, and the choir has lost a good conductor. However, with David as the lead singer, they finally achieve victory.
    Unfortunately, misfortune continues to strike this group of sufferers. The mine is shut down because the capitalists refuse to spend money on repairs, casting a tragic shadow over the entire mining area, causing anxiety and hesitation...
    Dick's son, Emlyn, cannot bear to see this situation and advises David to leave here and seek a new life elsewhere. However, David is unwilling to leave this group of friends who have shared hardships. They still hope to live on strongly. In order to support their families, the workers have to risk the poisonous gas and collapses in the mine disaster area to resume mining. When they are about to pass through the disaster area, the tunnel collapses, blocking the way out for David, Emlyn, and several others, and they are about to suffocate due to lack of oxygen. It is then decided to blast a path out with explosives. Because the fuse is short, the person who lights it will surely be sacrificed. David discusses it with the older Nick and intends to do the blasting himself, but everyone disagrees. Finally, they have to draw lots to decide. Emlyn draws the short straw. David would rather go in his place, but Emlyn refuses. At the last moment when he is helping Emlyn install the fuse, David knocks Emlyn unconscious and completes the explosion himself, sacrificing himself.
    The whole film is simple and touching, the editing is concise, and the language is refined. It portrays the solidarity, friendship, kindness, integrity, and self-sacrificing qualities of the working people.
    "Proud Valley" is a film with musical elements. It opens with the singing of the miners' choir, including rehearsals, competitions, mass prayers for the safety of the miners, music when they are cheered off to London, marching songs on the road, and street singing to beg for help out of desperation... all arranged very well and sung very successfully.
    In this film, we once again hear the singing of our beloved friend Paul Robeson. Majestic, powerful, beautiful, and profound, it so tightly grips people's heartstrings. Even after watching the film, for a long, long time, our hearts cannot be calmed.
    We all remember Paul Robeson once excitedly said: "If my heart could turn into a bird, I would let it fly freely, let it fly to distant China, let it tell the great and excellent Chinese people everything I want to say. The liberation of the Chinese people has brought to mankind the unparalleled power and confidence to make truth triumph over fallacy." We cherish this beloved friend's deep affection for the Chinese people, and we look forward to the day when Paul Robeson's majestic singing will resound on the soil of China. (Attached picture)

    骄傲的山谷　雄伟的歌声
    李凌
  去年，我们以崇敬、热烈的心情祝贺了伟大的和平战士、天才的黑人歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊的六十寿辰。今年，欣逢罗伯逊六十一岁诞辰的前夕，中国观众欣赏了他早期主演的电影“骄傲的山谷”。他以精湛、质朴的演技，塑造了一个令人难忘的工人形象；他那深沉雄伟的歌声，更深深打动了我们。
    看着银幕上那个充满力量的魁梧身躯，那张黧黑的面孔和善良、浑厚的微笑，使人感到罗伯逊不是在演戏，而是在真实地生活，在坚强地参加实际斗争。听着他的歌声，想到他的身世和他的崇高思想，对他的敬爱之情便愈益强烈了。
    电影“骄傲的山谷”，是描写第二次世界大战中，英国南威尔士地区的矿工，为争取工作和生活的权利、反对法西斯所进行的斗争。
    罗伯逊在影片里扮演了一个失业工人大卫。大卫到偏僻的山谷找工作，他是一位有歌唱天才的矿工能手，因为找不到事情，就跟一个流浪汉沿街卖唱，被煤矿合唱队的指挥狄克发现，就邀请他参加他们的歌队，并给他找到了工作。
    大卫是一个正直、勇敢的人，他对狄克非常尊敬。狄克在矿区遇难，大卫抢了进去把狄克背了出来，但因伤势太重死去了。狄克的家失去了支柱，大卫失去了一个敬爱的朋友，合唱队丧失了一个好指挥，然而，他们由大卫担任领唱，终于取得了胜利。
    不幸向这群苦难者不断袭来，矿厂因资本家不肯花钱修理而停工，整个矿区的居民，蒙上了一层悲惨的阴影，焦急、彷徨……。
    狄克的儿子艾密伦看到这种情景，待不下去，他劝大卫离开这里到别的地方另谋生路。然而大卫不愿意离开这群共患难的朋友。他们还希望坚强地活下去。工人们为了要养家糊口，不得不冒着煤矿灾区毒瓦斯和倒塌的危险，恢复开采。当正要通过灾区的时候，坑道倒塌下来，封住了大卫、艾密伦几人的出路，眼看就要因氧气缺乏而闷死。后来决定用炸药炸出一条路。因为引线短，炸的人一定牺牲，大卫就和年长的聂克商量，打算自己去炸，但大家不同意，最后只好抽签来决定。艾密伦抽中了，大卫宁愿自己去代替他，艾密伦不肯，大卫就在帮他安装引线的最后一刻把艾打昏，自己来替他完成爆炸而牺牲了。
    整个电影纯朴感人，剪接简洁，语言洗炼。它刻画出劳动人民之间的团结友爱和善良、正直、舍己为人的高贵品质。
    “骄傲的山谷”是一部带有音乐片性质的影片。一开幕就充满了矿工的合唱歌声，其中排练，比赛，群众祈告矿工平安的祷歌，欢送到伦敦时的音乐，在路上的行进曲，和迫于无奈求人救济的卖唱……，都安排得很好，而且演唱得非常成功。
    我们在这部影片里再一次地听到我们敬爱的朋友保罗·罗伯逊的歌声。雄伟有力、优美深沉，那样紧紧地扣住人们的心弦。直到看完影片，许久许久，我们的心情都不能平静。
    我们都还记得保罗·罗伯逊曾经兴奋地说过：“倘若我的心能化作一只飞鸟，我将让他自由飞翔，让他飞到遥远的中国，让它向伟大而优秀的中国人民诉出我想说的一切。中国人民的解放给人类带来了使真理战胜谬论的无比强大的力量和信心。”我们十分珍贵这位敬爱的朋友对中国人民的深情，我们期待着那一天——保罗·罗伯逊在中国的土地上震响着他的雄伟的歌声。（附图片）
