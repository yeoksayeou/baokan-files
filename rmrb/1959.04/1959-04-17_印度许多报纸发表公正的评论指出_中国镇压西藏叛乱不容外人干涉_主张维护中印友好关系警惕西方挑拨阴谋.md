Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th dispatch: Since the Tibetan rebellion, many Indian newspapers and periodicals have published fair commentaries, clearly pointing out the reactionary nature of the rebellion and the imperialist plots hidden within it. They advocate maintaining friendly Sino-Indian relations and that India should adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and not interfere in China's internal affairs.

    "Crossroads" said on March 31 that the Tibetan rebellion was "carried out by a group of reactionaries." It said, "No government can express any sympathy for those who tore up the agreement signed with the central government and launched a rebellion." The newspaper pointed out that this event "can help people understand how the agents of imperialism are trying to create disasters on the path of the people in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East who are seeking progress and complete freedom." The Bengali "Freedom Daily" said on April 7, "Those who created the Tibetan rebellion are not only enemies of the People's Republic of China, but also enemies of Indian independence. They hope to bring back to Indian soil those imperialists who have already been driven out."

    The newspaper said on March 30, "Great China has the right to suppress this counter-revolutionary plot in Tibet. We have no unease about this matter. But what is disturbing and concerning is that for several years imperialism has been trying to poison Sino-Indian relations. What is disturbing is that imperialist conspirators on Indian soil have established their bases on the Indian-Tibetan border and are plotting against our peace-loving friendly neighbor, China."

    "People's Power" said on March 27 that the Tibetan rebellion was entirely China's affair, "no country has the duty to interfere in the affairs of any other country." "Today's News" also believes that it is necessary for India to make it clear in a timely manner that it will "not give any country the opportunity, not even the hope, to use any part of India as a base for carrying out activities of interest to Tibet. In view of India's relations with China and international politics, this is necessary."

    The Urdu "Indian Daily Report" published an editorial on the Tibetan rebellion on March 30, supporting "India's policy of non-interference in the affairs of other countries." It said, "We believe this is the only correct policy." The newspaper believes that the statement made by Narayan, the former leader of the Indian People's Socialist Party, requesting that China be declared an "aggressor" "is unwise," and "this attitude fundamentally denies the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence." The "New Century" weekly pointed out that those who use the Tibetan rebellion to spread fabricated and exaggerated news "are currently playing the shameful role of diverting people's growing doubts about the United States' policies towards our country and focusing their attention on a provocative propaganda campaign against our country's friendship with China. This is executing the American conspiracy and does not conform to India's interests." "Freedom Daily" also said, "The current propaganda about Tibet is an attempt to divert people's attention from the dangerous consequences of the US-Pakistan military agreement."

    "Unity" on April 6 called on people to be vigilant against "the Western countries' attempts to provoke quarrels between India and China." On the 8th, it also called on people to beware of those who make "incendiary" speeches on the Tibetan rebellion, and said that any attempt to allow the Tibetan rebel group to "use our hospitality to carry out a struggle against China" is "harmful to India's interests."

　　印度许多报纸发表公正的评论指出
　　中国镇压西藏叛乱不容外人干涉
　　主张维护中印友好关系警惕西方挑拨阴谋
    新华社16日讯　新德里消息：在西藏叛乱事件发生以后，印度有许多报刊发表了公正的评论，明确指出叛乱的反动性质以及其中包藏着的帝国主义阴谋。它们主张维护中印友谊关系，印度应本着和平共处五项原则，不干涉中国的内政。
    “划时代报”在3月31日说，西藏叛乱是“一股反动分子搞出来的”。它说，“对于那些撕毁同中央政府签订的协定并且发动叛乱的人，没有一个政府可以表示任何同情。”这家报纸指出，这个事件“可以帮助了解帝国主义的代理人怎样设法在亚非和中东国家寻求进步和完全自由的人民的道路上，制造灾难。”孟加拉文“自由报”在4月7日说，“那些制造了西藏叛乱的人们不仅是中华人民共和国的敌人，而且是印度独立的敌人，他们希望把那些已经被赶出去的帝国主义者带回印度的土地上来。”
    这家报纸在3月30日说，“伟大的中国有权镇压在西藏的这个反革命阴谋。对这件事我们没有一点不安。但是令人不安和关切的事情是几年来帝国主义一直在设法毒害印中关系。令人不安的事情是在印度土地上的帝国主义阴谋分子已经在印度和西藏边境上建立起他们的基地，他们正在阴谋反对我们的爱好和平的友好邻国中国。”
    “人民力量报”在3月27日说，西藏叛乱事件完全是中国的事情，“没有一个国家有干涉任何其他国家的本分”。“今天报”还认为，印度有必要及时说清楚，它将“不使任何国家有机会那怕是希望利用印度的任何一部分来作为进行对西藏抱有兴趣的活动的基地，鉴于印度同中国的关系以及国际政治，这样做是必要的。”
    乌尔都文的“印度文汇报”在3月30日就西藏叛乱事件发表社论，支持“印度采取的不干涉其他国家事务”的政策。它说，“我们认为这是唯一正确的政策”。这家报纸认为印度人民社会党前任领袖纳拉扬发表的关于要求宣布中国是“侵略者”的声明“是不明智的，”“这种态度是根本否定和平共处五项原则的”。“新世纪”周报指出，那些利用西藏叛乱事件来散布捏造的和夸大的消息的人，“目前所起的可耻的作用，是要使人们把日益增大的对美国所采取的对我国政策的怀疑转移开，而把他们的注意力集中在一次反对我国同中国友好的挑衅宣传上。这是在执行美国的阴谋而不符合印度的利益的。”“自由报”也说过，“目前关于西藏的宣传是企图转移人们对美巴军事协定的危险后果的注意。”
    “团结报”在4月6日要求人们警惕“西方国家想在印度和中国之间挑起争吵的企图”。它在8日还要求人们提防那些就西藏叛乱发表“煽动性”讲话的人，并且说，允许西藏叛乱集团“利用我们好客来进行反对中国的斗争”的任何企图都是“有害于印度的利益的”。
