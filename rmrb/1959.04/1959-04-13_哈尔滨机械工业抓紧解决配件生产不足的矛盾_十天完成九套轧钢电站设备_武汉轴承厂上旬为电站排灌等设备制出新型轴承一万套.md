　　Harbin Mechanical Industry Seizes the Time to Solve the Contradiction of Insufficient Parts Production
　　Completes Nine Sets of Rolling Mill Power Station Equipment in Ten Days
　　Wuhan Bearing Factory Produces 10,000 Sets of New Bearings for Power Station Irrigation and Drainage Equipment in the First Ten Days of the Month

This newspaper, Harbin, 12th April - Over 100,000 workers in Harbin's mechanical industry have already completed seven sets of 400mm rolling mills, each capable of rolling 50,000 tons of steel annually, for Qinghai, Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Guizhou in the first ten days of the second quarter. All mechanical parts are being loaded onto trains in stages for shipment. In terms of power station equipment, two sets of 25,000-kilowatt large-scale thermal power generation equipment, composed of over 200,000 parts, have also been fully equipped and installed and will officially generate electricity at the Harbin Thermal Power Station in mid-April. In these ten days, 177 20-horsepower diesel engines for irrigation and drainage have also been manufactured for rural areas.

The task of manufacturing six major pieces of important equipment that Harbin City undertook in the first quarter was very large. However, in the manufacturing of these six major pieces of important equipment, a key problem for Harbin's mechanical industry is that its ability to manufacture mainframes is strong, while its ability to manufacture parts is weak. Therefore, whether important equipment can be shipped out fully equipped in the second quarter will be a major factor in determining whether the tasks for the six major pieces of equipment can be completed as scheduled.

Starting on the first day of April, Harbin City actively addressed this contradiction by closely monitoring the daily progress of each mechanical factory in manufacturing the six major pieces of equipment, ensuring that the collaborative parts were assigned to each factory, each workshop, and each machine tool. Workers were mobilized to carry out a "five comparisons" labor competition, comparing quality, output, efficiency, safety, and cost. In addition, the city also tapped into the potential of the mechanical industry, established a number of new supporting factories for instruments, screws, and other components, and launched comprehensive production collaboration throughout the city. Even the practice factories of colleges and universities and some of the mechanical forces of non-mechanical industries were organized to manufacture parts for the six major pieces of key equipment. As a result, the incomplete sets of rolling mills, power station equipment, and other equipment were quickly completed in early April, so that they can play their role in the second quarter of this year.

This newspaper, Wuhan, 12th April - The broad masses of workers at the Wuhan Bearing Factory have adopted the method of seizing key points and tackling weak links to strive to ensure the completion of national key products, achieving the requirements of daily high output. From April 1st to 11th, in a total of ten working days, the factory completed 10,000 sets of the new model 6205 industrial bearings, which are supporting products for power stations, irrigation and drainage, and other six major equipment projects.

From the Party committee to the workshop leadership departments, the Wuhan Bearing Factory has closely grasped the working method of linking one link to another and breaking through key points since the beginning of April. Steel balls are important components of bearings, so the leadership first focused on the steel ball group and keyly assisted the Wang Xianyun team, enabling the team's steel ball production to rapidly increase from 2,000 to 3,000 to 5,000 pieces per day. After the steel ball production was broken through in each team, the focus of leadership work shifted to the punch press group, helping the punch press group adjust its labor organization and mobilizing workers to make full use of existing equipment, so that the output per shift also increased exponentially. As a result, the average daily output of industrial bearings in this factory increased from 850 sets in March to 1,000 sets in the first ten days of April.

　　哈尔滨机械工业抓紧解决配件生产不足的矛盾
　　十天完成九套轧钢电站设备
　　武汉轴承厂上旬为电站排灌等设备制出新型轴承一万套
    本报哈尔滨12日电　哈尔滨机械工业十多万职工在第二季度的头十天里，已经为青海、新疆、云南和贵州等地完成了七套每年每套能轧制五万吨钢材的四百公厘的轧钢机，全部机械部件正在分期装上火车发运。在电站设备方面已经有两套由二十多万个零件组成的二万五千瓩大型火力发电设备也全部配齐，安装完毕，将于4月中旬在哈尔滨热电站正式发电。这十天还为农村制造出一百七十七台排灌用的二十马力的柴油机。
    哈尔滨市在第一季度承担制造的六大重要设备的任务量很大。但是哈尔滨市机械工业在制造六大重要设备中，一个关键问题是主机制造能力强而配件制造能力差，因此，今年第二季度怎样使重要设备配套外运，成为能不能如期完成六大设备任务的一个主要矛盾。
    哈尔滨市在今年4月份第一天开始，就积极解决这个矛盾，紧紧抓住了各机械工厂制造六大设备的日进度，使协作配件落实到每个工厂，每个车间，每个机床，发动职工开展了比质量、比产量、比效率、比安全、比成本的“五比”劳动竞赛。此外，全市还挖掘机械工业潜力，建立了一批新型的仪表、螺钉等配套工厂，并且开展了全市综合性的生产大协作，甚至将大专学校的实习工厂和一部分非机械工业的机械力量也组织起来，来制造六大重点设备的配件，因此在4月上旬就使这些不成套的轧钢、电站等设备迅速配成套，在今年第二季度就发挥它的作用。
    本报武汉12日电　武汉轴承厂的广大职工采取猛抓关键，突击薄弱环节的办法，奋力确保完成国家重点产品，实现了日日高产的要求。4月1日到11日计十个工作日中，这个厂完成了属于电站、排灌等六大设备配套产品的新型号6205工业轴承一万套。
    武汉轴承厂从党委到车间领导部门，4月初以来都紧紧抓住了一环扣一环、突破关键的工作方法。钢球是轴承的重要部件，领导就首先抓住钢球小组，并重点帮助王先运班，使这个班的钢球生产迅速从日产两千粒、三千粒提高到五千粒。钢球生产在各班突破以后，领导工作重点又转到冲床组，帮助冲床组调整了劳动组织，发动职工充分利用现有设备，使每班产量也成倍提高。结果这个厂4月上旬工业轴承平均日产量由3月份的八百五十套提高到一千套。
