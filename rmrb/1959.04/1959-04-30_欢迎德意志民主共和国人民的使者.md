　　On the eve of the common festival of the working people of the world – “May Day” International Labor Day, the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, led by Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the GDR, and Hermann Matern, First Deputy Chairman, arrived in our country for a friendly visit at our invitation. The people of our country warmly welcome the envoys of the people of the German Democratic Republic, and pay high tribute to all the German people who are fighting for the peaceful reunification of their motherland!
　　The People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are brothers of the same age and close members of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Although our two countries are thousands of miles apart, the common ideals of Marxism-Leninism and the common cause of building socialism link us together, making us an eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship. Over the past decade, this fraternal friendship has been consolidated and developed day by day. In particular, Prime Minister Grotewohl's two visits to China in December 1955 and January this year and the signing of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation have further strengthened our fraternal friendship. China and Germany support each other politically and cooperate economically and culturally. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic resolutely support the struggle of the Chinese people against the US imperialist occupation of our territory Taiwan. The valuable experience of the German Democratic Republic in building socialism and the industrial equipment and technical assistance supplied to our country have greatly helped the rapid development of our socialist construction. We deeply thank the people of the German Democratic Republic for their brotherly support and assistance to the Chinese people!
　　The people of the German Democratic Republic, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, have achieved brilliant achievements in the struggle to build socialism under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The industrial production of the German Democratic Republic is developing rapidly at a speed that capitalist countries cannot match. The industrial output in 1958 was more than one and a half times higher than before the war, and 10.9% higher than in 1957. In agriculture, a general bumper harvest of grain was achieved in 1958, and the output of several agricultural products per capita has exceeded that of West Germany. The agricultural cooperation movement is also developing rapidly. At present, the cultivated area of agricultural cooperatives has increased by 42% compared with 1957. If the cultivated area of state farms is added, the socialist component of agriculture accounts for 46% of the total cultivated area of the German Democratic Republic. The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held last July, put forward the task of "exceeding West Germany in terms of per capita consumption of all major necessities of life and consumer goods by the end of 1961." This year, the scale of economic construction in the German Democratic Republic will be even more magnificent, with industrial production increasing by 11.1% compared with last year, and the socialist transformation of agriculture will also be further developed. The brilliant victories achieved by the German Democratic Republic in socialist construction fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system and greatly inspire the struggle of all the German people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.
　　The heroic people of the German Democratic Republic, standing at the western outpost of the socialist camp, have waged unremitting struggles against imperialist forces and West German militarist forces, and for the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis and the maintenance of European and world peace. The Western countries, headed by the United States, have rudely undermined the Potsdam Agreement and have consistently adhered to the aggressive and war policy of splitting Germany and rearming West Germany, and have long rejected the various reasonable proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic for solving the German problem. The actions of the Western countries to obstruct the rational solution of the German problem have aroused the serious condemnation of peace-loving countries and people all over the world. Recently, under the pressure of just world public opinion, the Western countries, in order to get rid of their very embarrassing situation, were forced to agree to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of relevant countries in Geneva on May 11 this year to discuss the German issue, including a peace treaty with Germany and the Berlin issue. The Chinese people have always resolutely supported the German people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The recently concluded meeting of foreign ministers of the Warsaw Treaty member states and the People's Republic of China studied issues related to the upcoming Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference. In the communique of the meeting, the foreign ministers of the participating countries especially emphasized the urgency of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and eliminating the occupation system in West Berlin, and the necessity for the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference to reach an agreement on these issues. However, the meeting believes that these pressing issues should not be entangled with the issue of German reunification and European security. The purpose of those who attempt to do so is only to deliberately make things difficult and create obstacles for the meeting. The Chinese people fully support the various propositions reiterated at the Warsaw meeting and resolutely support the just struggle of the people of the German Democratic Republic and all the German people. We believe that no matter what kind of conspiracy the imperialists and the West German reactionaries may use to obstruct the peaceful and rational solution of the German problem, the German people's desire for peaceful reunification will eventually be realized.
　　This October, the people of our two countries will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the birth of our two countries. Over the past decade, the international situation has undergone major changes. Today, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is more united and stronger, the struggle of the people of all countries striving for national independence is more surging, and the imperialist camp is more divided. Today, when the East Wind is further prevailing over the West Wind, let the people of our two countries unite more closely in the struggle to build socialism and defend world peace, and work together hand in hand!

    欢迎德意志民主共和国人民的使者
    在全世界劳动人民的共同节日——“五一”国际劳动节前夕，由德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席约翰尼斯·狄克曼和第一副主席赫尔曼·马特恩率领的德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团，应邀到达我国进行友好访问。我国人民热烈欢迎德意志民主共和国人民的使者们，并且向正在为祖国和平统一而斗争的全体德国人民致以崇高的敬礼！
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国是同岁的兄弟，都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的亲密的成员。我们两国虽然相隔万里，但是马克思列宁主义的共同理想和建设社会主义的共同事业把我们联系在一起，使我们结成了永恒的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊。十年来，这种兄弟友谊一天天地巩固和发展。特别是格罗提渥总理1955年12月和今年1月两度访问我国和中德友好合作条约的签订，更进一步加强了我们的兄弟友谊。中德两国在政治上相互支持，在经济上和文化上互助合作。德意志民主共和国政府和人民坚决支持我国人民反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾的斗争。德意志民主共和国建设社会主义的宝贵经验和供应我国的工业设备与技术援助，大大有助于我国社会主义建设的迅速发展。我们深深感谢德意志民主共和国人民对中国人民的兄弟般的支持和援助！
    具有光荣的革命传统的德意志民主共和国人民，在德国统一社会党的领导下，在建设社会主义的斗争中取得了光辉的成就。德意志民主共和国的工业生产以资本主义国家望尘莫及的速度迅速发展。1958年的工业产量比战前增加了一倍半以上，比1957年增长10.9％。在农业方面，1958年谷物获得普遍丰收，在若干农产品产量按人口平均计算方面已超过了西德。农业合作化运动也迅速发展。目前农业合作社的耕地面积比1957年增长42％，如果加上国营农场的耕地面积，社会主义成分的农业已占德意志民主共和国全国耕地面积的46％。去年7月间举行的德国统一社会党第五次代表大会，提出了“到1961年底要在所有主要生活资料和消费品的每人平均消费量方面超过西德”的任务。今年德意志民主共和国经济建设的规模将更加宏伟，工业生产将比去年增加11.1％，农业社会主义改造也将获得进一步的发展。德意志民主共和国在社会主义建设中取得的辉煌胜利，充分显示了社会主义制度的优越性，大大鼓舞了全体德国人民争取和平统一祖国的斗争。
    英勇的德意志民主共和国人民，站在社会主义阵营的西方前哨，为反对帝国主义势力和西德军国主义势力，为争取在和平民主的基础上统一德国、维护欧洲和世界和平进行了不懈的斗争。以美国为首的西方国家粗暴地破坏波茨坦协定，一贯坚持分裂德国和重新武装西德的侵略和战争政策，长期拒绝苏联和德意志民主共和国所提出的解决德国问题的各项合理建议。西方国家阻挠德国问题合理解决的行为，引起了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的严正谴责。最近，西方国家在世界公正舆论的压力下，为了摆脱他们十分狼狈的处境，被迫同意于今年5月11日在日内瓦召开有关国家的外长会议，讨论德国问题，包括对德和约和柏林问题。中国人民一贯坚决地支持德国人民争取祖国和平统一的斗争。刚刚结束的华沙条约参加国和中华人民共和国外交部长会议，研究了与即将举行的日内瓦东西方外长会议有关的问题。在会议的公报中，与会各国外长特别强调了缔结对德和约和消除西柏林占领制度的迫切性，和东西方外长会议就这些问题达成协议的必要性。但是会议认为，不应该把这些刻不容缓的问题同德国统一问题和欧洲安全问题纠缠起来。那些企图这样做的人的目的，只是在于故意刁难，给会议制造障碍。中国人民完全拥护华沙会议所重申的各项主张，并坚决支持德意志民主共和国人民和全体德国人民的正义斗争。我们相信，不管帝国主义和西德反动派施展什么样的阴谋来阻挠德国问题的和平与合理解决，德国人民要求和平统一的愿望最后是一定要实现的。
    今年十月，我们两国人民都将庆祝我们两个国家诞生的十周年。十年来，国际形势起了重大的变化。今天，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加团结壮大，争取民族独立的各国人民的斗争浪潮更加汹涌澎湃，帝国主义阵营则更加走向四分五裂。在东风进一步压倒西风的今天，让我们两国人民在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中更加紧密地团结在一起，携手并进！
