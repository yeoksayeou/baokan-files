Comrade Chairman, Fellow Deputies:

    I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and all other reports of the congress, and firmly support all measures taken by the Central People's Government to quell the rebellion launched by the former local government and upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet, and to safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nationalities. Tibet is an indivisible part of China's territory, and we will never allow imperialists and Indian expansionists to collude with the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique to carry out open rebellion and create division. China and India have a long and profound friendship. We believe that the Indian people will cherish this friendship and will rise up to oppose the extremely arrogant behavior that violates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and interferes in China's internal affairs. Now I would like to talk about what I have learned about the great leap forward in industry in Shandong Province over the past year or so. Please point out any errors.

    I inspected industry in Shandong Province last September, and again between February and March this year, staying for a total of fifty-nine days. In Jinan, I visited three factories; in Qingdao, four factories; in Changwei Prefecture, seven factories and mines; in Gaotang County, five county-run factories, three people's commune-run joint factories, one farming area joint factory, and one production team joint processing station. During the inspection, I met with many advanced producers and held twenty-one discussions.

    In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, Shandong Province's industry leaped forward again and again. In 1957, the total industrial output value of Shandong Province was 3.64 billion yuan, which jumped to 7.6 billion yuan in 1958. The output of major products such as steel, iron, coal, electricity, cotton yarn, and crude salt increased rapidly. More than 1,000 major new products were successfully trial-produced, such as blast furnaces, converters, rolling mills, automobiles, electronic computers, and 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators. The achievements are enormous. The scale of Shandong Province's industrial plan for 1959 is even larger. According to this plan, the total industrial output value of Shandong Province in 1959 will reach 12.5 billion yuan. The output of major products will also increase rapidly. This is a reliable plan, and there is full confidence in completing or overfulfilling it.

    Shandong Province's industrial construction has achieved blossom everywhere. Taking Changwei Prefecture, where I visited, as an example, the total industrial output value of the prefecture in 1957 was 302.1 million yuan, which jumped to 811.444 million yuan in 1958. The output of major products such as steel, iron, coal, electricity, cotton cloth, and crude salt increased rapidly, and the industrial landscape has been completely renewed. Taking Gaotang County, where I visited, as another example, starting from October 15, 1958, within forty-five days, 181 factories were newly built or expanded, with an annual output value of 116 million yuan. Before the large-scale development of industry, the total industrial and handicraft output value of Gaotang County in 1957 was only 12.4544 million yuan. Although these newly built and expanded factories are small in scale, they are already capable of producing simple lathes, diesel engines, gas engines, alcohol, machine-made paper, and glass. Such a rapid leap forward will inevitably accelerate the industrialization of the communes and further facilitate the development of agricultural mechanization and electrification.

    The reason why Shandong Province's industry has achieved such results is primarily due to the good leadership of the Party. Under the unified leadership of the higher-level Party committees, the Party committees of various factories and mines resolutely implement the Party's line, principles, and policies. Wherever the Party points, the masses are mobilized to go there. The vast majority of workers can listen to the Party and recognize that "any work that deviates from the Party's leadership will inevitably lose its direction," reflecting that "of all the principles, the Party's leadership is the most important." The secretaries of all factory and mine work personally, act quickly, and grasp tightly. When promoting each task, they always explain the situation, tasks, key points, and measures clearly, explain the reasons, and then mobilize the masses to conduct discussions and debates, unify thinking, and raise awareness, so the work proceeds very smoothly. Under the correct leadership of the Party, the following basic tasks have been done very well in the past year or so:

    Political Leadership

    Various factories and mines fully emphasize "seven parts politics, three parts business," using the abstract to drive the concrete, combining the abstract and the concrete, and victoriously repelling the frantic attacks of the bourgeois rightists, criticizing right-leaning conservatism, and overcoming the "three winds and five airs." The Party committees of factories and mines always grasp the ideological situation of the workers and conduct different education according to different situations, thereby raising everyone's ideological awareness. Taking the Fangzi Coal Mine in Changwei as an example: because of political leadership, all employees have a clear direction, know who they are serving and working for, and ideological obstacles are swept away. In their work, they are full of fighting spirit and soaring enthusiasm. The coal production plan for 1958 was revised more than ten times, from 360,000 tons to 750,000 tons, and the actual completion was 780,000 tons, an increase of 117% compared with the actual completion in 1957. The cost has also been greatly reduced, fundamentally changing the backward state of annual losses since 1953.

    Two Participations and One Reform

    The effect of "two participations and one reform" is extremely great! Cadres participating in labor further master the ways to lead production, discover problems in production at any time, and thus grasp the key and solve problems. Workers participating in management strengthen their sense of responsibility and give play to their initiative. A new situation has emerged in factories and mines where everyone uses their brains and everyone contributes ideas. In the past, some people held a skeptical attitude towards workers participating in management, fearing that factories and mines would be messed up. Facts have proved that not only has it not been messed up, but management has been even better. The reform of unreasonable rules and regulations and the simplification of various cumbersome procedures have also greatly improved work efficiency. Many factories and mines have streamlined their organizations, adjusted their structures, and reduced the waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources. Through "two participations and one reform," cadres, workers, and technicians eat and live together, work together, and their feelings are very harmonious and completely integrated. Taking the Qingdao No. 6 State-owned Cotton Mill as an example: cadres go deep into the workshops to participate in labor, leading cadres focus on planting experimental fields, using points to lead the whole area, and general cadres combine with their own business and arrange appropriately. Workers set up groups between themselves, and each group sets up several major members to participate in management. In terms of business reform, various written and unwritten systems were discussed by the masses, studied by the leaders, and 41 were cancelled, 127 were revised, and 24 were newly built; 205 kinds of reports were cancelled, 93 were revised, and 8 were newly built. After "two participations and one reform," the overall concept of contact with production practice, mutual understanding, cooperation, and coordination from top to bottom has been promoted, and democratic life and enterprise management have made great progress.

    Vigorously Carry Out Mass Movements

    Running industry and carrying out vigorous mass movements will, of course, result in more, faster, better, and more economical results. "The power of the masses is endless. The masses are not only all-rounders, but also omnipotent. Relying on the masses, all problems can be solved. Leaving the masses, it is difficult to move an inch" has become a conclusion. Taking Yinji People's Commune in Gaotang County as an example: from October 19, 1958, to the end of November, a total of 25 new and expanded factories were built, with 66 production units. Whenever something happens, it is handed over to the masses for discussion. The masses unanimously proposed: "If you want people, there are people; if you want things, there are things; how much you want, there is how much." When building the factory, "Clever Girl" Wang Xiuqin led 45 young women and built eight factory buildings on the flat ground in five days and nights; young heroes Yin Chengfu, Qu Jingli, Chen Guisheng, Liu Baoquan, Wang Yanyi, etc. moved 20,000 bricks in one afternoon, singing: "Run factories, we take the lead, we can't carry soil, we move bricks, build factories early, and live a happy life for thousands of years." In addition, there are many vivid examples. In terms of materials, the masses supported a total of 762 cubic meters of wood, 760,000 bricks, 85,700 tiles, 55,670 catties of lime, 822 large tanks, vacated 218 old houses, and in addition, there were iron materials, firewood, reeds, etc. The conclusion drawn by the cadres is: "Thousands of plans, the mass line is the first plan."

    Launch a Major Technical Revolution

    In 1958, various factories and mines launched a vigorous technical innovation movement centered on transforming equipment, improving technology, increasing production, increasing varieties, and ensuring the completion of the leap forward plan. In terms of the breadth, depth, and speed of this movement, it is unprecedented. After the movement was launched, the technical level of the vast majority of workers has been greatly improved, and the potential of enterprises has been unprecedentedly liberated. Many of the original repair factories and handicraft cooperatives have leaped to become factories capable of manufacturing a variety of products. At the same time, technical innovation has also overcome the difficulties of insufficient equipment and raw materials. Taking Gaotang County Machinery Factory as an example: the original foundation was very poor and the equipment was simple. In 1958, a technical innovation movement was launched, using indigenous methods to start first, first indigenous and then foreign, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and using the method of "ants gnawing bones" to break through technical fortresses and successfully manufacture a ten-horsepower single-cylinder horizontal gas engine to support agricultural mechanization. In the process of trial production, many difficulties were encountered. If one experiment failed, another experiment was conducted, and finally everything was overcome. Then, an eight-foot gantry planer, spring hammer, saw, and blanking machine were successfully manufactured. The conclusion drawn by the workers is: "As long as you dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, you can create miracles; as long as you are not superstitious, new things will appear."

    Vigorously Develop Steel

    In the second half of 1958, Shandong Province, like other provinces, set off an unprecedented upsurge in vigorously developing steel. Nearly ten million people across the province, directly and indirectly, were involved in this great movement, and now hundreds of thousands of people have initially mastered the production technology of iron and steel smelting. After this exercise, workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, men and women, young and old, fully realized the great political and economic significance of steel. Steel was smelted, and people were also tempered. The harvest is inestimable! Taking Changwei Prefecture, where I visited, as an example, at the peak of the vigorous development of steel, as many as 2.24 million people in the prefecture were involved in this great movement. After adjustment, the steel team recently finalized still has more than 97,000 people, which is really a grand spectacle! Shandong Province is quite rich in steel resources. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee are drafting a "Steel Base Construction Plan." This vigorous development of steel has laid a good foundation for the future development of Shandong Province's steel industry.

    The above are the few basic tasks with remarkable achievements done by various factories and mines under the correct leadership of the Party. During my two inspections, I also paid attention to the deeds and styles of advanced producers, and held discussions with nearly 200 advanced producers one after another, listening to them narrate the process of their advanced deeds and reflect the ideological situation at that time, and I was extremely excited! At the same time, they are so simple, so modest, and so enthusiastic, giving me an unparalleled and profound impression. Now, various factories and mines are running Red and Expert Schools, and some factories and mines have already formulated relatively detailed Red and Expert long-term plans. The vast majority of workers have personal Red and Expert plans, and political learning and business learning are not relaxed for a moment. New people and new things are everywhere.

    1959 is a year of decisive significance in the three years of hard struggle. We believe that Shandong Province will definitely implement the Party's principles and policies on the industrial front and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than in 1958.

    山东工业跃进的几点经验
    钱昌照代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和大会的其他各项报告，坚决拥护中央人民政府下令平定原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的叛乱，维护祖国统一和民族团结的一切措施。西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，我们决不允许帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子勾结西藏上层反动集团进行公开叛乱，制造分裂。中印两国有长久的深厚的友谊，我们相信印度人民一定会珍视这种友谊，一定会起来反对违反和平共处五项原则，干涉中国内政的极端狂妄的行为。现在想谈一谈我所了解的一年多来山东省工业大跃进的情况，请指正。
    去年九月我在山东省视察工业，今年二、三月之间又去过一次，两次共停留五十九天。在济南看了三个工厂，在青岛看了四个工厂，在昌潍专区看了七个厂矿，在高唐县看了县办的五个工厂，人民公社办的三个联合工厂，一个耕作区的联合工厂，一个生产队的联合加工站。在视察中，和不少先进生产者见了面，座谈二十一次。
    一九五八年山东省工业在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，跃进再跃进。一九五七年山东全省工业总产值为三十六亿四千万元，一九五八年一跃而为七十六亿元；主要产品如钢、铁、煤炭、电力、棉纱、原盐等的产量增长很快；试制成功的主要新产品有高炉、转炉、轧钢机、汽车、电子计算机和六千瓩的汽轮发电机等一千余种；成绩是巨大的。一九五九年山东省的工业计划规模更要大，按照这个计划，一九五九年山东全省工业总产值将达一百二十五亿元；主要产品的产量，也将飞速增长。这是一个可靠的计划，完成或者超额完成是有充分把握的。
    山东省工业建设做到了遍地开花。就我去过的昌潍专区来说，一九五七年全区工业总产值为三亿零二百一十万元，一九五八年一跃而为八亿一千一百四十四万四千元；主要产品如钢、铁、煤炭、电力、棉布、原盐等的产量增长很快，工业面貌焕然一新。再就我去过的高唐县来说，一九五八年从十月十五日开始，经过四十五天的时间，新建、扩建了一百八十一个工厂，年产值可达一亿一千六百万元，而在大办工业以前，一九五七年高唐县工业、手工业总产值只有一千二百四十五万四千元。这些新建、扩建的工厂，规模虽小，已经能够生产简易车床、柴油机、煤气机、酒精、机制纸、玻璃等。如此飞腾跃进，必然会加速公社工业化，更有利于农业机械化、电气化的发展。
    山东省工业所以能够获得这样的成绩，首先是由于党的领导好。各厂矿党委在上级党委的统一领导下，坚决执行党的路线和方针政策，党指向那里，就发动群众走向那里。广大职工都能听党的话，认识到：“任何工作，脱离党的领导，必然走失方向”，反映说：“千条万条，党的领导是第一条”。厂矿一切工作，书记亲自动手，行动得快，抓得紧。在推动每项工作的时候，总是把形势、任务、关键、措施交代清楚，讲明道理，然后发动群众，鸣放辩论，统一思想，提高认识，因此工作进行得非常顺利。在党的正确领导下，一年多来，各厂矿对于以下几项基本工作做得很好：
    政治挂帅
    各厂矿充分强调七分政治，三分业务，以虚带实，虚实并举，胜利地击退了资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻，批判了右倾保守，克服了三风五气。厂矿党委随时掌握职工的思想情况，针对不同的情况进行不同的教育，从而提高了每个人的思想觉悟。以昌潍坊子煤矿为例：由于政治挂帅，全体职工有了明确的方向，知道为谁服务，为谁劳动，思想障碍一扫而空，在工作中，斗志昂扬，干劲冲天。一九五八年煤炭的生产计划经过十几次的修改，由三十六万吨提高到七十五万吨，实际完成七十八万吨，比一九五七年实际完成数增长百分之一百一十七。成本也大大降低，根本改变了一九五三年以来年年亏损的落后状态。
    两参一改
    两参一改的效果大极了！干部参加劳动，进一步掌握了领导生产的途径，随时发现生产中的问题，从而抓住关键，解决问题。工人参加管理，加强了责任感，发挥了主动性，在厂矿中出现了人人动脑筋、个个献计策的新局面。过去有些人对工人参加管理抱着怀疑态度，惟恐厂矿弄乱，事实证明，不但没有弄乱，而且管理得更好了。至于不合理规章制度的改革，各种繁琐手续的简化，也使得工作效率大大提高，许多厂矿紧缩了机构，调整了组织，减少了人力、物力、财力的浪费。通过两参一改，干部、工人和技术人员吃住在一起，劳动在一起，感情十分融洽，完全打成一片。以青岛国棉六厂为例：干部深入车间，参加劳动，领导干部着重种试验田，以点带面，一般干部结合本身业务，适当安插。工人之间设小组，每组设几大员，参加管理。业务改革方面，各种成文不成文的制度，经过群众鸣放，领导研究，取消了四十一种，修改了一百二十七种，新建了二十四种；各种报表取消了二百零五种，修改了九十三种，新建了八种。两参一改以后，从上而下，接触生产实际，互相了解，协作配合的整体观念得以发扬，民主生活、企业管理都有很大的进步。
    大搞群众运动
    兴办工业，开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动，结果当然是多快好省。“群众的力量，是无穷无尽的，群众不但是多面手，而且是万能手，依靠群众，一切问题可以得到解决，离开群众，寸步难行”已成定论。以高唐县尹集人民公社为例：从一九五八年十月十九日起，到十一月底，新建、扩建工厂共有二十五个项目，六十六个生产单位。遇事交给群众讨论，群众一致提出：“要人有人，要物有物，要多少，有多少。”在建厂的时候，“巧姑娘”王秀琴带领四十五名青年妇女，五昼夜在平地上盖起八间厂房；小英雄尹成福、曲敬礼、陈贵生、刘保全、王延义等一个下午搬来了两万块砖，他们高唱：“办工厂，咱抢先，不能抬土就搬砖，早把工厂建设好，幸福生活万万年。”此外还有许多生动的事例。物料方面，群众一共支援了木材七百六十二立方公尺，砖七十六万块，瓦八万五千七百片，石灰五万五千六百七十斤，大缸八百二十二口，腾出旧房二百一十八间，此外还有铁料、柴草、苇子等等。干部得出的结论是：“千计万计，群众路线是第一计”。
    大闹技术革命
    一九五八年各厂矿开展了一个声势浩大的以改造设备、改进工艺、提高生产、增加品种、保证完成跃进计划为中心的技术革新运动。就这一次运动的广度、深度、速度来说，是前所未有的。运动开展以后，广大职工技术水平大大提高，企业潜力得到空前的解放。不少原来的修配工厂和手工业合作工厂，一跃而为能够制造多种产品的工厂。同时技术革新也克服了设备和原材料不足的困难，以高唐县机械厂为例：原来基础很差，设备简单，一九五八年开展了技术革新运动，运用土法先上马，先土后洋，土洋结合，蚂蚁啃骨头的办法，攻破了技术堡垒，制造成功十马力单缸卧式煤气机，支援农业机械化。在试制过程中，遇到不少困难，一次试验不成再试验，终于战胜一切。接着又制造成功八尺龙门刨床、弹簧锤、锯床、下料机等，工人们得出的结论是：“只要敢想、敢说、想做，就能创奇迹；只要不迷信，就有新的东西出现。”
    大办钢铁
    一九五八年下半年山东省和其他各省一样，掀起了史无前例的大办钢铁的高潮。全省直接间接将近一千万人投入这一伟大运动，现在已经有几十万人初步掌握了炼铁炼钢的生产技术。工农商学兵、男女老幼经过此次锻炼，充分认识到钢铁在政治上、经济上的重大意义。炼了钢铁，也炼了人，收获是无法估计的！就我去过的昌潍专区来说，在大办钢铁最高潮的时候，全区投入这一伟大运动的多至二百二十四万人，经过调整，最近定下来的钢铁队伍尚有九万七千多人，真是轰轰烈烈！山东省钢铁资源相当丰富，省委、省人委正在拟订“钢铁基地建设规划”，此次大办钢铁，为将来山东省钢铁工业的发展奠定了良好的基础。
    以上所说的是各厂矿在党的正确领导下，成绩昭著的几项基本工作。我在两次视察中也曾注意先进生产者的事迹和风格，先后和近二百位的先进生产者座谈，倾听他们叙述先进事迹的经过，反映当时的思想情况，兴奋之至！同时他们又是那么朴素，那么虚怀，那么热情，给我无比深刻的印象。现在各厂矿都办红专学校，有的厂矿已经订出了比较详尽的红专远景规划，广大职工都有个人红专规划，政治学习、业务学习，一刻不放松，新人新事，到处都是。
    一九五九年是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，我们相信山东省在工业战线方面，定能贯彻党的方针政策，实现比一九五八年更大更好更全面的跃进。
