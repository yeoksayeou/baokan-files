Editor's Note:

　　From "Experimental Plot" to "Command Zone"
Agricultural production is continuing to leap forward, and a large-scale, high-yield bumper harvest movement is underway everywhere. Under such circumstances, a new problem has arisen: if leading cadres limit themselves to managing small experimental plots, they often cannot promptly discover and solve problems in the large-scale high-yield movement. What should be done? Yu Jiajun, the First Secretary of the CPC Fushun County Committee, after consulting with the masses, created a good method: have many cadres cultivate larger plots of land together as a "command zone" to lead the large-scale high-yield movement.

　　In participating in the production of the "command zone," Yu Jiajun and other comrades explored a set of methods for reasonably arranging crops, time, and labor, which greatly helped to solve the contradiction between higher levels of intensive cultivation and labor shortages. They also, in participating in the production of the "command zone," found the most reasonable rice planting methods for various types of areas based on the characteristics of sunlight, water flow, and wind direction in different regions, which helped to solve the contradiction between close planting and ventilation and light transmission. Obviously, these good methods could not be found in small experimental plots. Of course, for some new yield-increasing measures that are not yet certain, it is still necessary to conduct small-scale experiments first. There can also be small experimental plots in the "command zone."

　　Continuously improving working methods as the situation develops is the only way to continuously and better lead the masses forward.

### 从“试验田”到“指挥区”

　　从“试验田”到“指挥区”
    农业生产正在继续大跃进，到处都在开展大面积高额丰产运动。在这样的形势下，产生了一个新的问题：领导干部仅仅限于搞小块试验田的生产，往往不能及时地发现和解决大面积高产运动中的问题。怎么办呢？中共富顺县委第一书记于家俊同志同群众商量的结果，创造了一种好方法：由许多干部一起种面积较大的田地，作为“指挥区”来领导大面积高产运动。
    在参加“指挥区”的生产中，于家俊和别的同志们在一起摸索到了一套合理安排作物、时间、劳动力的方法，大大有助于解决更高度的精耕细作和劳动力不足的矛盾。他们还在参加“指挥区”的生产中，根据不同地区的光照、水向和风向等特点，找到了各类地区的最合理的插秧方式，有助于解决密植和通风透光的矛盾。很显然，这些好办法，在小块试验田中是无法找到的。当然，有些尚不能肯定的新的增产措施，先作小块的试验还是必要的。在“指挥区”中，还可以有小块试验田。
    随着形势的发展不断改进工作方法，才能不断地更好地领导群众前进。
