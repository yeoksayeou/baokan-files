Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 5th: The North Atlantic Group Council meeting, held in Washington for three days, concluded on April 4th – the group's tenth anniversary – amidst heightened "Cold War" rhetoric. A communiqué issued after the meeting was permeated with the "Cold War" spirit, declaring the continuation of the "strength" policy consistently pursued by this aggressive group over the past decade, aimed at obstructing the relaxation of international tensions.

The communiqué stated that the council discussed the current international situation, particularly the Berlin issue, as well as the upcoming Geneva talks on the German question. It also discussed the views of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany regarding issues they intend to negotiate with the Soviet Union. "The council expressed complete agreement on the overall direction of the policy to be pursued in the future." It "declared its hope to see outstanding issues resolved through negotiations, while confirming its unified determination to safeguard the freedom of the people of West Berlin and to uphold the rights and obligations of the allies."

The communiqué repeated anti-communist clichés, stating, "In examining the political situation in other parts of the world, the council discussed the continued imposition of various forms of pressure by international communism on the free world. This pressure threatens not only the member states of the alliance but also many other free countries, including some that have only recently gained independence."

Subsequently, this aggressive military group organization, under the banner of the so-called "communist threat" it manufactured, indicated its intention to persist in pursuing anti-peace and anti-people policies. The communiqué stated that the council believed that the "fundamental reasons" that led to the establishment of the group ten years ago "remain valid today." The participants reaffirmed their "determination to maintain their common defense efforts" and agreed to further develop the "principle of mutual reliance" in order to "maximize" the utilization of available resources for military preparations.

The communiqué touted the "enormous importance" that the North Atlantic Group had demonstrated over the past decade, and said that it would continue to develop as an "indispensable foundation for the security and defense of the free world." The communiqué urged "consistency in the actions and policies" of the group's member states, believing that the internal unity of the group was the "best guarantee" for the West to maintain its "Cold War" stance in negotiations with the Soviet Union.

    在“冷战”破锣声中
    大西洋集团理事会议收场
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：北大西洋集团理事会会议在华盛顿举行三天会议以后，已经在4月4日——这个集团成立十周年的一天——在加剧“冷战”声中结束。会后发表的一个公报贯串着“冷战”精神，宣称将继续执行这个侵略集团十年来一贯奉行的阻挠缓和国际紧张局势的“实力”政策。
    公报说，理事会讨论了目前的国际局势，特别是柏林问题，以及即将在日内瓦举行的有关德国问题的谈判，还讨论了美、英、法、西德四国提出的它们对要同苏联谈判的一些问题的意见。“理事会对于今后奉行的政策的总方针表示了完全的一致”。它“一方面声明希望看到悬而未决的问题将通过谈判解决，同时确认它一致决心维护西柏林人民的自由，维护盟国的权利和义务”。
    公报重弹反共滥调说，“在检查世界其他部分的政治形势时，理事会讨论了国际共产主义继续向自由世界施加的各式各样的压力。这种压力不仅威胁到联盟成员国，而且威胁到其他许多自由国家，包括一些不久前才获得独立的国家。”
    接着，这个侵略性的军事集团组织就在它制造的所谓“共产主义威胁”的旗号下表明它将坚持奉行反和平、反人民的政策。公报说，理事会认为，导致在十年前建立这个集团的“根本原因今天仍然成立”，与会者重申“决心保持他们的共同防御努力”，并且赞成要进一步发展“互相依靠原则”，“以便最大限度地”利用可以利用的资源来进行军事备战。
    公报鼓吹北大西洋集团在十年中证明有“十分巨大的重要性”，并且说，它将继续作为“安全和自由世界的防御的不可缺少的基础而发展。”公报竭力要求这个集团的成员国的“行动和政策的一致”，认为这个集团内部的团结一致是西方在同苏联谈判时坚持西方“冷战”立场的“最好保证”。
