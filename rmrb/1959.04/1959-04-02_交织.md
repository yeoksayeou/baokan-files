    Intertwined

    After reading the newsletter "Sheep Worker and Professor," a surge of intense excitement filled my heart.

    If I were a painter, I would definitely paint this picture: a professor shaking hands with a sheep worker, teaching him artificial insemination techniques; despite their different clothes and ages. Even if they have no similarities in appearance, two hearts – to learn well and to teach well – are completely intertwined.

    The background of this painting is the vast fields of the motherland and countless flocks of sheep. What a vivid and distinct image this is! It symbolizes the characteristics of our era, demonstrating the Party's principle of combining theory with practice and the victory of combining indigenous and foreign methods. It also shows the tremendous changes in people's thoughts and feelings.

    Now, people can still distinguish "sheep worker and professor" in words and differentiate between indigenous and foreign from appearance, but in their hearts, they are completely intertwined. Not mixed, nor blended, but forged in the fiery furnace of common ideals, they are intertwined. The new child born from the combination of indigenous and foreign methods is science. The sheep worker does not say this new child is "mine," nor does the professor say this new child is "mine." They say it belongs to all of us, it is a treasure for building the motherland. There is one thing they argue fiercely about: the sheep worker is deeply afraid that he hasn't told the professor every single bit of his sheep-raising experience, and the professor tries everything possible to teach the sheep worker his theoretical knowledge. They are intertwined from another angle: trying their best to teach, trying their best to learn, everyone wholeheartedly dedicating everything to the motherland's sheep-raising事业.

    If someone says, "You insist they are intertwined, but I don't see it that way," then let me tell you:

    The sheep worker didn't understand the new technology, so the professor taught it to him. The professor was completely ignorant of the experience of herding sheep in all seasons, so the sheep worker taught it to him; and they wrote three books based on the sheep worker's experience. There are also many new things about sheep raising that the professor doesn't understand, and the sheep worker doesn't understand either. So they all sit down together, talking and listening, experimenting and researching. As a result, everyone understands. Not only do they understand, but they can also do it. The sheep worker learned to use equipment for operations, and the professor followed the sheep worker up the mountain to herd sheep. The professor then deeply realized the importance of practical knowledge. The so-called intertwining is not intertwined from the beginning. There is a process and a struggle. Only through arduous paths can they truly intertwine. Learn from each other, take the best from each other; eat, live, and work together, completely integrating in life; when there are different opinions, discuss them, patiently persuade, wait, and even show the other person how to do it. Sometimes, it is also necessary to conduct self-struggle. All of this cannot be said in one or two sentences. To truly intertwine, one must do it with the spirit of a revolutionary. To climb the peak of science, fear no difficulties, and never stop until the goal is achieved. The sheep worker and the professor demonstrate this spirit.

    Do the sheep worker and the professor have no differences at all? Are they perfect and flawless? There are differences, and there are also some imperfections. It cannot be said now that the sheep worker has learned everything from the professor, and the professor has learned everything from the sheep worker. This is impossible. Science is endless, and it cannot be said that the sheep worker and the professor are already enough. They must greatly improve, until when? Until the difference between physical labor and mental labor is eliminated. However, in any case, from the combination of the sheep worker and the professor, we have already seen this budding. The road has already begun, and it will always reach the destination. The road will not get farther and farther, but only closer and closer.

    The true painter who created this picture of the sheep worker and the professor is the great Party. This painting is immortal; the road pointed out by the Party is forever correct.

    交织
    薛雅
    看了“羊工和教授”的通讯，一阵强烈的激动涌上心头。
    如果我是画家，一定要画这样一幅画：教授握着羊工的手，教给他人工授精的技术；尽管他们的衣服不一样，年龄不一样。即或他们外表没有一点相似的地方，但是，两颗心——学好和教好——完全交织在一起。
    这幅画的背景是祖国广阔的田野和无数的羊群。这是多么生动、多么鲜明的形象啊！它象征着我们这个时代的特点，表现出党的理论与实践结合的方针和土洋结合的胜利，也可看出人们思想感情的巨变。
    现在，人们还可以从字面上区别“羊工和教授”，从外表上区别土和洋，骨子里他们已完全交织在一起了。不是掺和，也不是揉合，而是经过共同理想的烈火熔炼，他们交织在一起了。土洋结合诞生的新儿是科学，羊工不说这个新儿是“我”的，教授也不说这个新儿是“我”的，说是我们大家的，是建设祖国的宝贝。有一点他们倒是争得很凶：羊工深怕他自己的一点一滴养羊经验没有告诉教授，教授想尽一切办法把自己理论知识教给羊工。他们又从另一个角度交织在一起了：尽力教，尽力学，大家一心一意，把一切献给祖国养羊事业。
    如果有人说：“你硬说他们交织在一起，我看不然。”那就让我说给你听：
    羊工不懂新技术，教授教给他了。教授对于四季放羊经验，根本无知，羊工教给他们了；他们又根据羊工的经验，写成了三本书。还有养羊的许多新事，教授不懂，羊工也不懂。他们就一齐坐下来，又说又听，又试验又研究，结果，大家都懂了。不光是懂得了，还会做。羊工学会了使用器械操作，教授跟着羊工上山放牧，教授才更深地体会到实践知识的重要。所谓交织，并不是一开始就交织在一起了，这里有过程，也有斗争。通过艰苦的道路，才能真正交织在一起。互相学习，取长补短；同吃同住同劳动，生活上彻底打成一片；遇有不同意见，要商量，要耐心说服，要等待，甚至要做出样子给对方看。有时还要进行自我斗争。所有这一切，都不是一句两句话可以说完。要真正交织在一起，就要以一个革命者的精神去做。为了攀登科学高峰，不怕一切困难，不达目的誓不休。羊工和教授是表现了这种精神的。
    羊工和教授是不是就没有一点差别了呢？是不是就完美无缺了呢？是有差别的，也不是一点缺陷也没有了。现在还不能说羊工已学到了教授的一切，教授已学会了羊工的一切，这是不可能的。科学是无止境的，更不能说羊工和教授已经够了。他们还要大大提高，一直到什么时候呢？到体力劳动和智力劳动的差别消灭的时候。不过，无论如何，我们从羊工和教授结合这件事上，已经看到了这种萌芽。路，已经开始在走了，总会走到目的地的。路不会越走越远，只会越走越近。
    创作羊工和教授这幅画的真正画家，是伟大的党。这幅画是不朽的；党指明的道路，是永远正确的。
