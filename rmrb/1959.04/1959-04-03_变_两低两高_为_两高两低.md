    Transforming "Two Lows and Two Highs" into "Two Highs and Two Lows"
    Wang Pu
      "The current situation of small blast furnace production being characterized by 'two lows and two highs' (low utilization coefficient, low qualified pig iron rate, high coke ratio, high cost) must be reversed to become 'two highs and two lows' (high utilization coefficient, high qualified pig iron rate, low coke ratio, low cost)." This is the battle cry put forward at the National Small Blast Furnace Production Technology Conference held in mid-to-late March. The conference also proposed the main goals to strive for based on this slogan: the average utilization coefficient should strive to reach more than one ton of iron produced per cubic meter of volume, the qualified rate of pig iron should strive to reach more than 95%, and the coke consumption per ton of iron produced should first be reduced to below 1,600 kilograms, and gradually strive towards the goal of 1,200 kilograms.
      Can "two lows and two highs" be transformed into "two highs and two lows"? According to recent reports, it is entirely possible. For example, the main indicators of some small blast furnaces such as No. 5 small blast furnace of Xuzhou Huaihai Iron and Steel Plant, various iron-smelting plants in Shijiazhuang area, Shuicheng Iron Plant in Guizhou, and Weipu Iron and Steel Plant in Yangquan have reached or approached the goals set at the National Small Blast Furnace Production Technology Conference, and have raised the red flag of high yield, high quality, and low cost. The workers of these units have created many valuable experiences in production technology and production management in the process of transforming "two lows and two highs" into "two highs and two lows." To summarize these experiences simply in one sentence, it is "grasping the conditions for the transformation of contradictions."
    High and low, good and bad, etc., are two mutually exclusive, mutually struggling, and mutually opposing aspects of the development of things, but they are also interdependent, coexisting in a unified body, and can also be transformed into aspects opposite to themselves under certain conditions. Therefore, it is very important to grasp the conditions under which contradictions transform each other. Lenin said: "Dialectics is a doctrine that studies how opposites can be identical, and how they become identical (how they are transformed into identical ones) – under what conditions they transform each other, become identical…." To promote the development of things, to transform the objective world, to transform low yield into high yield, poor quality into high quality, poverty into wealth, and passivity into initiative, we must recognize and create the conditions for the transformation of low yield to high yield, poor quality to high quality, poverty to wealth, and passivity to initiative. If these conditions are not met, the contradiction will not be transformed; if they are not fully met, the transformation of the contradiction will not be significant. Taking the production of small blast furnaces with certain mechanical equipment as an example, high temperature, strong wind, multi-nozzle combustion, and "eating fine grains" are necessary conditions for high yield, high quality, low coke ratio, and low cost. If these conditions are not met, even if other conditions are good, the original two "lows" will not be transformed into "highs," and the original two "highs" will not be transformed into "lows." Because other conditions are not or not directly required for the transformation of contradictions, this is what the common saying means: unable to scratch the itch.
    If the conditions are not met, the contradiction will not be transformed, low yield will not become high yield, and poor quality will not become high quality. Does this have a bit of a "conditionalism" flavor? No. The error of conditionalism is not because it attaches importance to the role of objective conditions, but because it absolutizes the conditions, denies the subjective initiative of people, and denies that people can change objective conditions and create new conditions. Marxists not only never deny the role of objective conditions, but also believe that people's subjective initiative is to act on the change of objective conditions, create favorable conditions, and overcome unfavorable conditions. But to ensure that every effort of people hits the nail on the head and is conducive to the transformation of contradictions and the development of production, it is necessary to correctly grasp the main conditions for the transformation of contradictions in practice. If the key to solving the problem is not found, one cannot help but bump around blindly, achieving half the result with twice the effort.
    Small blast furnaces shoulder half of this year's pig iron production task. Transforming "two lows and two highs" into "two highs and two lows" is a major issue concerning 18 million tons of steel. After several months of effort, many small blast furnaces have created the conditions for the transformation of two lows into two highs and two highs into two lows. Now our task is to continue to put politics in command in various enterprises, rely on the masses, launch a mass movement on a large scale, and, in the movement, create conditions rapidly according to the characteristics of our own enterprises, universally realizing the transformation of "two lows and two highs" into "two highs and two lows", so that every small blast furnace has high output, high quality, low coke consumption, and low cost.

### 变“两低两高”为“两高两低”

    变“两低两高”为“两高两低”
    王朴
      “把当前小高炉生产‘两低两高’（利用系数低、生铁合格率低、焦比高、成本高）的局面扭转过来，变成‘两高两低’（利用系数高、生铁合格率高、焦比低、成本低）。”这是3月中下旬召开的全国小高炉生产技术会议提出的战斗口号。会议还根据这个口号提出了主要的奋斗目标：平均利用系数要争取达到每一立方公尺的容积产铁一吨以上，生铁合格率争取达到95％以上，生产每吨铁消耗的焦炭，首先下降到一千六百公斤以下，逐渐向一千二百公斤的目标奋斗。
      “两低两高”能不能变为“两高两低”？根据最近的一些报道来看，是完全可以的。例如徐州淮海钢铁厂第五号小高炉、石家庄地区各炼铁厂、贵州水城铁厂、阳泉苇瀑钢铁厂等的一些小高炉的各项主要指标，都分别达到或者接近了全国小高炉生产技术会议上提出的奋斗目标，竖起了高产、优质、成本低的红旗。这些单位职工在变“两低两高”为“两高两低”的过程中，在生产技术和生产管理方面都创造了很多宝贵经验。要简单地用一句话来概括这些经验，那就是“把握矛盾转化的条件”。
    高和低、好和坏等等是事物发展的两个互相排斥、互相斗争、互相对立的方面，但又是互相依存着，共处于一个统一体中，并且还可以在一定的条件下，各向着和自己相反的方面转化。所以，掌握矛盾在什么条件下互相转化十分重要。列宁说：“辩证法是这样的一种学说：它研究对立怎样能够是同一的，又怎样成为同一的（怎样变成同一的），——在怎样的条件之下它们互相转化，成为同一的……。”我们促进事物的发展，要改造客观世界，要变低产为高产，变劣质为优质，变贫穷为富裕，变被动为主动，就得认识和创造低产向高产、劣质向优质、贫穷向富裕、被动向主动转化的条件。这些条件不具备，矛盾就不会转化；具备得不完全，矛盾转化就不会显著。拿有一定机械装备的小高炉生产来说，高温、大风、多嘴燃烧、
  “吃细粮”，是高产、高质、焦比低、成本低的必要条件。这些条件不具备，即使其它条件很好，原来的两“低”也不会向“高”转化，原来的两“高”也不会向“低”转化。因为其它条件不是或者不直接是矛盾转化所需要的，这就是俗话所说的：抓不到痒处。
    条件不具备，矛盾就不会转化，低产就不会变高产，劣质就不会变优质，这是否有点“唯条件论”的味道？不。唯条件论的错误，不是因为重视客观条件的作用，而是把条件绝对化，否认人的主观能动作用，否认人可以改变客观条件，可以创造新的条件。马克思主义者不仅从来不否认客观条件的作用，而且认为人的主观能动性就是作用于客观条件的改变，创造有利条件，克服不利条件。但要使人的每一分努力都打中要害，都有利于矛盾的转化，有利于生产的发展。就要在实践中能正确掌握到矛盾转化的主要条件，如没有找到解决问题的关键，就不免乱撞乱碰，事倍功半。
    小高炉担负着今年生铁生产的一半任务。变“两低两高”为“两高两低”，是事关一千八百万吨钢的大事情。经过几个月来的努力，许多小高炉已经创造了两低向两高转化和两高向两低转化的条件，现在我们的任务，就是在各个企业继续政治挂帅，依靠群众，大搞群众运动，在运动中根据自己企业的特点，迅速创造条件，普遍地实现变“两低两高”为“两高两低”，使座座小高炉都产量高、质量高、耗焦少、成本低。
