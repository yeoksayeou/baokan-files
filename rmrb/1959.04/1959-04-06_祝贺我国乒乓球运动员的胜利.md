    Congratulations on the Victory of Our Country's Table Tennis Players
    This morning, good news came from Dortmund that Rong Guotuan, our country's outstanding 21-year-old table tennis player, won the world championship in the men's singles final of the 25th World Table Tennis Championships. Prior to this, our men's and women's teams had also achieved excellent results in the team competition, ranking third in the world. We extend our warm congratulations to the table tennis players who have won glory for the motherland.
    To win in the World Table Tennis Championships, an athlete must not only have skilled and superb techniques, but also a strong and tenacious will. Because in just a few days, they have to compete several times a day, and their opponents are all the best players in the world. Taking the men's singles as an example, winning the championship requires passing eight rounds. Rong Guotuan withstood this test, replacing the Japanese player who had won the championship for four consecutive years and winning the championship honor. Our athletes Wang Chuanyao, Yang Ruihua, Zhuang Jiafu, Xu Yinsheng, Qiu Zhonghui, Sun Meiying, etc. also defeated many world-renowned players with their tenacious will, including Narita, the third seed in men's singles and Japanese champion, Mei Wenhe, the sixth seed from South Vietnam, and Haydon, the second seed in women's singles from England.
    The good results achieved by our country's table tennis players in world competitions are inseparable from the importance attached to sports by our Party and country. On the basis of widely开展群众性体育运动 [widely carrying out mass sports activities], a large number of outstanding athletes have emerged. Those participating in this World Table Tennis Championships are not only the old players of the past, but also young players. Rong Guotuan, Yang Ruihua, and Xu Yinsheng are all just over twenty years old.
    In participating in this world competition, our athletes also exposed some shortcomings, such as being too nervous and impetuous on the spot, and not being calm enough. However, as the experience of participating in competitions increases in the future, these shortcomings can be completely overcome. It is hoped that our outstanding athletes will guard against arrogance and impetuosity, continue to work hard, practice diligently, and strive for greater victories for the motherland in future world competitions.

    祝贺我国乒乓球运动员的胜利
    今晨从多特蒙德传来捷报，我国二十一岁的优秀乒乓球运动员容国团，在第二十五届世界乒乓球锦标赛男子单打决赛中，夺得世界冠军。在此以前的团体赛中，我国男队、女队也都取得很好的成绩，列为世界第三。我们向为祖国争得荣誉的乒乓球运动员们致以热烈的祝贺。
    在世界乒乓球锦标赛中取胜，对一个运动员来说，不仅要有熟练精湛的技术，而且必须有顽强坚韧的意志。因为在短短几天中，每天要比赛几场，对手又都是世界最优秀的选手。以男子单打来说，取得冠军要连闯八关。容国团经受住了这个考验，代替了蝉联四届冠军的日本选手，夺得了冠军荣誉。我国运动员王传耀、杨瑞华、庄家富、徐寅生、丘锺惠、孙梅英等等也都以顽强的意志击败了许多世界著名选手，其中包括男子第三号种子、日本冠军成田，第六号种子、南越的梅文和，以及女子第二号种子、英国的海顿。
    我国乒乓球运动员在世界比赛中取得良好成绩，是和我们党和国家重视体育运动分不开的。在广泛开展群众性体育运动的基础上，出现了大批优秀运动员。参加这届世界乒乓球锦标赛的，已不仅仅是过去的几员老将，而且有了年轻的选手，容国团、杨瑞华、徐寅生，就都是刚过二十岁。
    在参加这次世界比赛中，我国运动员也暴露了一些缺点，如临场过于紧张、急躁，不够沉着，等等。但是随着今后参加比赛的经验增多，这些缺点是完全可以克服的。希望我国优秀的运动员们戒骄戒躁，继续努力，刻苦练习，在以后的世界比赛中，为祖国争取更大的胜利。
