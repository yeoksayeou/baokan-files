How to Prevent and Control Wheat Rust?
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection

In the main winter wheat producing areas, wheat pests and diseases (rust is currently a relatively serious hazard) have entered the initial stage of outbreak, and in some areas have begun to enter the stage of widespread occurrence. This poses a great threat to a bumper wheat harvest. This year, the soil moisture conditions in various regions are very good, and weather forecasts predict that rainfall in the Yangtze River basin and the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River will be higher than in previous years in April, which is more favorable for rust, which prefers humidity. All regions must attach great importance to this situation and seize the opportunity to prevent and control it.

The types and severity of wheat rust occurring in various regions vary, and different prevention and control measures should be taken according to different situations. In areas where stripe rust is a hazard, according to recent findings in Shaanxi Province, wheat fields can be roughly divided into four categories based on the degree of disease occurrence: The first category is where the entire field has already been affected, and the disease incidence rate has reached or is close to 100%. Spraying pesticides in these wheat fields cannot achieve the effect of protecting production for the wheat itself, and they become a source of disease, posing a great threat to wheat fields that have not yet been affected or have very mild infections. It is necessary to continuously spray a 3% ammonium sulfate solution every three to five days to kill the diseased leaves and completely eliminate the source of infection. The second category is wheat fields where the disease is widespread. For these wheat fields, it is necessary to combine killing diseased leaves with protecting healthy leaves. In the center of infection or areas where diseased leaves are dense, it is necessary to spray ammonium sulfate solution, and spray a protectant throughout the field (once every ten days or so), three to four times. The third category is wheat fields where the disease is relatively mild, generally with no or very few centers of infection. For these wheat fields, a protectant can be sprayed once every ten days. The fourth category is wheat fields with no disease. Careful inspection should be carried out frequently. If the disease incidence rate reaches about one in a thousand during the heading period, it is necessary to spray pesticides for protection, three to four times.

If there are a large number of spores locally, and the diseased and unaffected wheat fields are distributed in different areas, a protection belt about three li wide can be established in the unaffected areas. Pesticides should be sprayed first within the protection belt to delay the onset of the disease in wheat fields outside the protection belt.

In areas where leaf rust occurs, emphasis should be placed on inspecting and controlling diseased wheat fields discovered in early spring. If the disease incidence rate reaches about one in a thousand during the booting to heading stage, spraying of protectant should begin immediately, generally two to three times, about ten days apart each time.

In areas where stem rust is a hazard, spray protectant immediately before and after heading when fungal spore piles begin to appear in the field, or when a large number of spores appear continuously in the air.

Protectants for preventing and controlling wheat rust can be roughly divided into three categories: Those with better effects include zineb (diluted with water 600 times for use), colloidal sulfur (diluted with water 300 to 400 times for use), sodium fluorosilicate (diluted with water 300 times for use, mainly for treating stripe rust), sodium fluoride (diluted with water 300 times for use, mainly for treating stripe rust); in addition, lime-sulfur mixture, barium polysulfide, and mixtures of various indigenous pesticides or crop straw soaking solutions also have very good effects. Those with moderate effects include dinitro-o-cresol (diluted with water 200 times for use, for treating stem rust and leaf rust), barium polysulfide (diluted with water 300 times for use), lime-sulfur mixture (with a Baumé reading of 0.5 being appropriate), and soaking solutions of indigenous pesticides such as tea cake, common caraway, and spider lily (one part of indigenous pesticide added to ten parts of water, boiled for one hour or cold-soaked for one day and night), filtered for use. Those with poorer effects include saltwater and soaking solutions of various indigenous pesticides such as spurge and dock.

In areas where lime-sulfur mixture is used, it should be mixed with indigenous pesticides or crop straw soaking solutions as much as possible. According to multiple experiments by our institute, the effect of the mixture exceeds that of lime-sulfur mixture with a Baumé reading of 0.5, and it is more stable. The mixing method is to add three parts of the boiling or soaking solution of indigenous pesticides or crop straw to seven parts of lime-sulfur mixture with a Baumé reading of 0.2 (use one part of indigenous pesticide or straw added to ten parts of water, boil for one hour or cold-soak for one day and night, replenish the lost water, and mix with the lime-sulfur mixture after filtering). The indigenous pesticides used are dry materials; if fresh materials are used, the proportion of indigenous pesticides needs to be increased appropriately. Since the concentration of lime-sulfur mixture is reduced and other ingredients are added, the sulfur needed to prevent and control rust on one mu of land can be used on more than three mu of land, and the effect is even better than using lime-sulfur mixture alone. Many indigenous pesticides can be mixed with lime-sulfur mixture, such as tea cake, spurge, redshank, wolfsbane, dock, soapberry, hairy anemarrhena, pagoda tree bean, willow leaves, poplar leaves, cypress leaves, pine needles, sunflower leaves, maple leaves, etc. Using soaking solutions of crop straws such as rice straw, wheat straw, corn stalks, sorghum stalks, and cotton stalks has the same effect.

When spraying protectants or other drugs, it must be done evenly. Generally, 150 to 200 jin of liquid medicine per mu is sufficient. If it rains after spraying, re-spraying should be done. In addition, in rainy areas in the south, doing a good job of ditching and draining in wheat fields and lowering the groundwater level is also important for reducing the occurrence of rust.

Currently, the temperature is rising rapidly. Other wheat pests and diseases, such as wheat scab and wheat blossom midge, have also occurred or are about to occur and are developing very rapidly. It is also necessary to seize the opportunity and vigorously carry out prevention and control work.

    怎样防治麦锈病？
    中国农业科学院植物保护研究所
    在主要冬麦产区，小麦病虫害（目前锈病为害比较严重）已经进入初发阶段，有的地区开始进入普遍发生的阶段。这对小麦丰收威胁很大；今年各地墒情很好，气象预报4月份长江流域和黄河中下游的降水量将较历年为多，这对于喜欢潮湿的锈病更为有利。各地要高度重视这个情况，抓紧时机防治。
    各地发生的小麦锈病，种类不一，程度也有差别，应当根据不同的情况采取不同的防治措施。在条锈病为害地区，根据最近在陕西省的了解，按照病害发生程度，大体上可以将麦田分为四类：第一类已经全田发病，病株率达到或接近100％，这类麦田喷射药剂对小麦本身已不可能收到保产的效果，而且成为病源基地，对尚未发病或发病很轻的麦田是一个很大的威胁，必须每隔三天到五天连续喷洒3％的硫酸铵水杀伤病叶，彻底消灭病源；第二类麦田发病普遍，对这类麦田要把杀伤病叶和保护健叶相结合，在传病中心或病叶密集的地方需要喷布硫酸铵水，另外全田普遍喷保护剂（每隔十天左右喷一次），喷三至四次即可；第三类麦田发病较轻，一般没有或只有很少的传病中心，对这类麦田，可每隔十天喷洒一次保护剂；第四类麦田没有发病，应经常进行仔细的检查，在孕穗到抽穗期间如发病株率达到千分之一左右，就需要普遍喷药保护，喷三至四次即可。
    当地如有大量菌源，而发病的麦田和未发病的麦田又分布在不同的地带时，可以在未发病的地区确定出一条宽约三里的保护带，先在保护带内喷药，以延缓保护带以外麦田的发生时期。
    在叶锈病发生地区，应着重检查和防治早春发现的有病麦田。在孕穗至抽穗阶段，如果发病株率达到千分之一左右，就应当立即开始喷洒保护剂，一般喷二至三次即可，每次相隔十天左右。
    在秆锈病为害地区，抽穗前后当田间开始出现病菌孢子堆，或空中连续出现大量菌源时，就应立即喷药保护。
    防治小麦锈病的保护剂大致可以分为三类：效果较好的有代森锌（兑水六百倍使用），胶体硫（兑水三百至四百倍使用），氟矽酸钠（兑水三百倍使用，主要治条锈），氟化钠（兑水三百倍使用，主要治条锈）；另外，石硫合剂、多硫化钡和多种土农药或作物秸秆浸煮液的混合剂效果也很好。效果中等的有二硝散（兑水二百倍使用，治秆锈叶锈）、多硫化钡（兑水三百倍使用），石硫合剂（以波美零点五度为合适）及茶饼、鹤虱、石蒜等土农药的浸煮液（一份土农药加水十份熬煮一小时或冷浸一昼夜），过滤使用。效果较差的有食盐水及猫儿眼、酸模等多种土农药的浸煮液等。
    在使用石硫合剂的地区，应尽量以土农药或作物秸秆浸煮液混合使用。根据我所多次试验，证明混合剂的效果超过波美零点五度的石硫合剂，而且比较稳定。混合剂的配制方法是以零点二度的石硫合剂七份，加土农药或作物秸秆的熬煮液或浸出液三份（用土农药或秸秆一份加水十份熬煮一小时或冷浸一昼夜，补足失去水量，过滤后与石硫合剂混合），土农药用的是干材料，如用新鲜材料，土农药的比例需要适当提高。由于降低了石硫合剂的浓度并加入了其他成份，原来防治一亩地的锈病所需要的硫黄可以供三亩多地用，效果比石硫合剂单用还好。可以与石硫合剂混合的土农药很多，如茶饼、猫儿眼、红蓼、狼毒、酸模、皂角、毛知母、国槐豆、柳树叶、杨树叶、柏树叶、松树叶、向日葵叶、枫叶、等等，用稻秸、麦秸、玉米秸、高粱秸、棉秸等作物秸秆浸煮液混合使用也有同样作用。
    喷洒保护剂或其他药物，必须做到均匀，一般每亩喷一百五十斤到二百斤药液即可。喷药后，如遇下雨，应当补喷。此外，在南方多雨地区，作好麦田的开沟排水工作，降低地下水位，对减轻锈病发生也有重要作用。
    目前气温上升很快，小麦的其他病虫害，如小麦赤霉病、吸浆虫也已经发生，或即将开始发生，而且发展十分迅速，也需要抓紧时机，大力展开防治工作。
