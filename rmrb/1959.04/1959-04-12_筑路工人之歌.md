　　Song of the Road Builders
            Ding Shaoxiang
    Last year, we were still in the Kunlun Mountains,
    Today, we've arrived at the Ili River,
    Our motherland's rivers and mountains are so vast and beautiful,
    We'll embroider her with lines of red again.

　　筑路工人之歌

    去年还在昆仑山上，
    今天又到伊犁河边，
    祖国的河山多么宽阔俊秀，
    我们为她再绣上条条红线。
