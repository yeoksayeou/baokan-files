Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 3rd: The Paris "Express" weekly published an article on March 19th entitled "The New Darling, Little Squirrel Alvin, Replaces the Hula Hoop Dance." Although the article is only a few lines long, it vividly reveals the extent to which capitalism's "civilization," stained with the stench of money, has decayed. An excerpt translation is as follows:

	The once-popular hula hoop dance is now disappearing (some stores are now selling hula hoops for only a few cents each). "Mass psychology" experts and those who want to make quick money are beginning to figure out what other gimmick to replace the hula hoop dance. The best candidate is a little Tamias North American squirrel named Alvin, who first appeared last November singing a charming tune called "The Chipmunk Song" (the record of "The Chipmunk Song" has sold four million copies in six weeks), and then he sang "Alvin's Harmonica."

	Alvin's ingenious inventor is an obscure composer, Bagdasarian, who specializes in erotic fantasies. To record "The Chipmunk Song"—this record recorded the incomprehensible cipher of three noisy squirrels—Bagdasarian sang various segmented tunes in front of a microphone, and then he replayed the recording at twice the speed. The result is teeth-grinding, but it will earn Bagdasarian $750,000 in a year.

### 资本主义“文明”日益腐朽  呼拉圈被人厌倦  小松鼠成新宠儿

    资本主义“文明”日益腐朽
    呼拉圈被人厌倦
    小松鼠成新宠儿
    据新华社3日讯　巴黎消息：3月19日的巴黎“快报”周刊发表一篇文章，题目是“新的宠儿小松鼠阿耳文代替了呼拉圈舞”，文章虽仅寥寥数行，却比较生动地道出了染满铜臭的资本主义“文明”已经腐烂到了什么程度。特摘译如下：
    盛行一时的呼拉圈舞现在正在消失（某些商店的呼拉圈现在只卖几分钱一个），“群众心理”专家们和想迅速赚钱的人开始捉摸要想个什么另外的玩艺儿代替呼拉圈舞。最好的候补者是一只小塔米雅斯北美松鼠，它叫阿耳文，是去年11月演唱一首迷人小调“塔米雅斯之歌”的时候第一次出现的（六个星期以来“塔米雅斯之歌”的唱片已出售四百万张），接着它又唱了“阿耳文口琴曲”。
    阿耳文的天才发明家是一个不出名的作曲家巴格达萨里安，他专长于色情的幻想曲。为了灌制“塔米雅斯之歌”——这张唱片录下三只吵闹的松鼠的令人无法理解的暗语——巴格达萨里安在扩音器前演唱了各种分段曲，然后，他用两倍的速度重放录音。结果是使人感到牙齿发酸，但是，这将使巴格达萨里安在一年内赚到七十五万美元。
