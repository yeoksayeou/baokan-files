Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 20th: Gopalan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of India, stated in his opening address at the Fifth Conference of the Communist Party of India's Uttar Pradesh organization in Lucknow on April 18th, "Western imperialists are attempting to divert our attention, portraying the Tibetan incident as if it were the greatest danger to India." He said, "The Tibetan incident is an enlightening event for us. Western imperialists are jealous of China's very rapid development and the very friendly relations between China and India. They are waiting for an opportunity to undermine Sino-Indian relations. Those who oppose the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the great friendship between India and China are secretly working to sabotage it."

He further said, "Tibet is a part of China. Our government agrees with this. There is no question of undermining Tibetan autonomy. We have already recognized China's sovereignty over Tibet. Therefore, the Tibetan incident is China's internal affair. We must not forget that all our words and deeds must conform to the development and maintenance of friendly relations with China."

The famous Tibet expert, Rahul Sankrityayan, said at the meeting on the 19th, "Imperialists are trying to weaken the friendship between China and India, but they will not succeed."

The West Bengal State Organization Conference of the Communist Party of India, which recently closed in Calcutta, unanimously passed a resolution on strengthening Sino-Indian friendship. The resolution stated that a nationwide movement must be launched immediately to strengthen Sino-Indian friendship.

The resolution said, "Sino-Indian friendship is a powerful weapon in the struggle for world peace and for African countries to win freedom. Therefore, U.S. imperialism has long been trying to weaken Sino-Indian friendship and worsen relations between the two countries."

The resolution welcomed Nehru's statement on maintaining friendly relations with China. The resolution accused the Indian People's Socialist Party and others who oppose the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence of using the Tibetan incident to spread anti-China sentiment in India.

India's "Free Press" said on the 20th: "The fanciful messages sent by foreign journalists from their chartered planes over Tezpur allow us to understand how the Dalai Lama's drama is being used by the West to achieve the goals of the Cold War." The newspaper pointed out, "It would be a sad mistake if Indian public opinion were tempted and followed the West on this point."

Referring to the leader of the Indian People's Socialist Party, Mehta, the newspaper said that he was "at the forefront" of those who were "making things difficult for India."

Refuting Mehta's advocacy of the so-called "Dalai Lama should have complete freedom of action in India," the newspaper said, "We cannot be fooled," because this means asking for "the right to establish a parallel Tibetan government on Indian territory" to "carry out activities against China," "perhaps even meaning the right to collect weapons and recruit troops."

The newspaper said, "It is unimaginable that the Indian government would encourage such activities while maintaining its diplomatic contact with Beijing." The newspaper pointed out that if the Indian government takes the wrong step, the impact will be far-reaching.

The Urdu daily "Hind Samachar" said on the 19th, "We believe that the views expressed by the People's Socialist Party leader Asoka Mehta on the Tibetan issue and the Dalai Lama do not represent our views." The newspaper also criticized those parties that "stir up disputes" over the Tibetan incident, thereby "adversely affecting Sino-Indian relations."

### 印度公正的公众舆论大声疾呼  珍重印中友好关系　严防帝国主义挑拨

    印度公正的公众舆论大声疾呼
    珍重印中友好关系　严防帝国主义挑拨
    新华社新德里20日电　印度共产党书记处书记高普兰4月18日在印度共产党北方邦组织在勒克瑙举行的第五次会议上致开幕词说，“西方帝国主义者企图转移我们的注意力，把西藏事件说成好像是对印度的最大危险。”他说，“西藏事件对我们来说，是一件启发人的事件。西方帝国主义者妒忌中国的非常迅速的发展和中印两国之间的十分友好的关系，它们正在待机破坏印中关系。那些反对和平共处五项原则和印中的伟大友谊的人正在暗中活动来破坏它。”
    他又说，“西藏是中国的一部分。我国政府同意这一点。不存在什么破坏西藏自治的问题。我们已经承认中国对西藏的主权。因此西藏事件是中国的内政。我们不要忘记，我们的一切言行必须符合发展和维护同中国的友好关系。”
    著名的西藏问题专家拉胡尔·桑克里蒂亚雅纳19日在会上讲话说，“帝国主义者正在设法削弱中印两国之间的友谊，但是他们是不会成功的。”
    最近刚在加尔各答闭幕的印度共产党西孟加拉邦组织会议一致通过了关于加强中印友谊的决议。决议说，必须立即开展全国性的运动来加强印中友谊。
    决议说，“印中友谊是争取世界和平和非洲国家争取自由的有力武器。因此，美帝国主义长期以来一直在设法削弱印中友谊和使两国关系恶化。”
    决议对尼赫鲁关于将同中国保持友好关系的声明表示欢迎。决议指责印度人民社会党和其他反对和平共处五项原则的人正在利用西藏事件在印度国内散布反对中国的情绪。
    印度“自由新闻”在20日说：“外国记者在提斯浦尔上空从他们包租的飞机上发出的富于空想的消息，使我们了解到达赖喇嘛的戏正在如何被西方利用来达到冷战的目的”。这家报纸指出，“如果印度舆论在这一点上受到诱惑和追随西方的话，那将是可悲的错误。”
    这家报纸在提到印度人民社会党领袖梅达时说，他在“使印度感到为难”的那些人中“名列前茅”。
    这家报纸在驳斥梅达鼓吹所谓“应该让达赖喇嘛在印度有完全的行动自由”的要求时说，“我们不能上当”，因为这意味着要求“有权在印度领土上建立一个平行的西藏政府”来“进行反对中国的活动”，“也许甚至意味着有权收集武器和招募军队”。
    这家报纸说，“印度政府鼓励这种活动，而同时又保持它同北京的外交接触，这是不可想像的事。”这家报纸指出，印度政府走错一步，影响就很深远。
    乌尔都文日报“印度文汇报”在19日说，“我们认为，人民社会党领导人阿索卡·梅达关于西藏问题和达赖喇嘛所发表的意见并不代表我们的观点”。这家报纸还指责那些在西藏事件上“煽动纠纷”从而“不利地影响中印关系的”那些政党。
