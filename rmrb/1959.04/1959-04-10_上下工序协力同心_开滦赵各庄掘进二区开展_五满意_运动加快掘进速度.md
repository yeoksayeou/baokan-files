From our newspaper's Tangshan dispatch on April 9th: A new creation has emerged in the mass movement at the Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine: Excavation District No. 2 has launched a "Five Satisfactions" campaign, shining with communist ideals. Since the campaign began at the end of February, four working faces have been handed over to production approximately two months ahead of schedule, turning the mine's situation from being short 100,000 tons of recoverable coal in the first quarter to overfulfilling its first-quarter production target. A new excavation tactic has also been born in this campaign.

In February of this year, due to the daily increase in the mine's output and some special reasons, the mine needed 100,000 tons of recoverable coal to complete its plan to produce 940,000 tons of coal in the first quarter. The Party committee issued a battle call to the workers of Excavation District No. 2: Hand over the three working faces originally scheduled to be completed in May and June ahead of schedule in March, paving the way for the mine to complete its first-quarter production target. When the Party branch of Excavation District No. 2 held a branch committee meeting to discuss this task, they unanimously resolved to hand over the three working faces on time or ahead of schedule to satisfy the leadership; to create favorable conditions for production and ensure project quality to satisfy the coal mining area, security, and inspection departments; to excavate the roadways straight to satisfy the installation team; and to ensure good three-shift cooperation, leaving no difficulties for each other, to satisfy all three shifts of workers. The "Five Satisfactions" campaign, based on the overall situation and oriented towards production, was launched at this branch committee meeting. New tactics for excavation work and other major measures were also formulated at this branch committee meeting. Afterwards, the branch committee handed over these ideas of the nine branch committee members to the more than 370 people in the district to think about and implement. The masses posted big-character posters, expressing their determination, making guarantees, offering suggestions, checking the shortcomings of their work, and proposing improvement measures. Thus, the communist ideology, with "Five Satisfactions" as its banner, turned into a huge force for completing the excavation task quickly, well, and economically, 600 meters underground.

In order to realize the slogan of "Five Satisfactions," Excavation District No. 2 worked hard in three aspects: accelerating speed, improving quality, and strengthening collaboration. They first stopped excavating three of the nine working faces being excavated simultaneously, maintained three, and concentrated their efforts on attacking three. The nine branch committee members went to each shift of the three key working faces as "political commanders," taking the lead in labor. The district chief transferred Zhang Baodian, the district's red banner pacesetter for excavation, to the 7598 working face as a model, and transferred the Pang Junchao Youth Commando to the 7310 working face for a blitz. As a result of appropriately concentrating forces on attacking key points, the three working faces were completed ten to fifteen days ahead of the date proposed by the mine's Party committee, and approximately two months ahead of the original schedule for handover to production in May and June. On April 4, another working face was completed two months ahead of schedule. Engineers from Zhaogezhuang Mine said that this method is an innovation in excavation work. In the past, when forces were used in a dispersed manner, it generally took six months to excavate a working face. During this period, due to changes in ground pressure, about 40% of the supports were crushed and needed to be repaired or replaced every three months. Therefore, each excavation working face needed to be repaired twice, which was both labor-intensive and material-intensive. Adopting the tactics of Excavation District No. 2, the excavation time for each working face was reduced from six months to four months, requiring only one repair in the middle. In this way, each working face can save 60 cubic meters of wood and 400 workdays, saving a total of about 5,000 yuan in costs.

After the "Five Satisfactions" campaign, the cadres and Party and League members of Excavation District No. 2 led all the workers to use the few minutes of spare time before and after shifts to clean up the broken coal on each working face, creating favorable conditions for production and clearing out thousands of tons of coking coal for the country. The excavation workers also changed the supports at the boundaries of the working faces to plank sheds, so that the coal mining workers would not have to dismantle the supports and make new plank sheds after receiving the working faces, as they had done in the past. This allowed each working face to be put into production two or three days earlier than in the past. Each working face put into production one day earlier can produce about 1,000 tons of coking coal for the country.

Excavation District No. 2 also launched a personal competition of "Six Comparisons and Six Views" with red flags awarded daily in the "Five Satisfactions" campaign, namely, comparing footage to see efficiency, comparing quality to see specifications, comparing safety to see measures, comparing attendance to see discipline, comparing unity to see collaboration, and comparing innovation to see results. Because the revolutionary sense of honor and revolutionary sense of responsibility were integrated into the workers here, they wanted to achieve new results in everything they did, and they competed to raise red flags every day. In March, 342 of the 370 workers in the district raised red flags, that is, more than 92% of the people won the honor of "Five Satisfactions" for the collective, made outstanding achievements, and also won personal honors.

While carrying out political mobilization work, all the workers in Excavation District No. 2 also responded to the proposal of veteran workers Li Ruihe and Yuan Shaojiang to change the piece-rate wage system calculated on a per-shift basis to a piece-rate wage system calculated on a three-shift basis, promoting internal collaboration from the wage system. In this way, some workers' thinking that creating favorable conditions for the next shift meant "making the next shift earn more and making this shift earn less" was changed. The phenomenon of not working before getting off work if an unfinished job (unable to get a piece-rate wage) could not be completed was also changed, and it was truly achieved that they would not leave difficulties for each other and would create favorable conditions for each other. The three shifts were no longer a cooperative relationship, but a fighting whole. Therefore, work efficiency was greatly improved. The workers' actual wages also increased by 10% accordingly in March.

The measures taken by the Second Excavation District resulted in a strange event at Zhaogezhuang Mine: on March 15, the mine director notified the Seventh and Sixth Mining Areas and other relevant departments to inspect the 7310 working face. The director and technicians of the Seventh and Sixth Mining Areas said, "There's no need to go and see it. Why bother." It turned out that they had long secretly inspected it because they suspected that the quality of the project must be poor since this working face was handed over to production so quickly. They saw that this working face and roadway were as neat as if they had been cut with a knife. Even the security and inspection personnel, who were regarded as the iron-faced and selfless "Bao Gong," said, "That roadway should really be photographed and used as a red banner pacesetter for the excavation working face." This inspection without people became the most satisfactory inspection and the greatest trust and reward for Excavation District No. 2. Such a thing is also a wonder in the country's coal mines.

The other three working faces handed over ahead of schedule in March and April also achieved "Five Satisfactions."

### 上下工序协力同心  开滦赵各庄掘进二区开展“五满意”运动加快掘进速度

    上下工序协力同心
    开滦赵各庄掘进二区开展“五满意”运动加快
    本报唐山9日讯　开滦赵各庄煤矿群众运动中出现新的创举：掘进二区开展了闪耀着共产主义思想的“五满意”运动。从2月末开展这一运动以来，有四个工作面各提前两个月左右移交生产；使全矿由第一季度缺少十万吨可采煤量的局面转而超额完成了首季生产任务；一种新的掘进战术也在这一运动中诞生了。
    今年2月，由于全矿产量日日上升和一些特殊的原因，全矿要完成第一季度生产九十四万吨煤的计划，缺少十万吨可采煤量。党委向掘进二区的职工发出了战斗的号召：在3月份提前交出原计划5、6月份完成的三个工作面，为全矿完成首季生产任务开路。掘进二区党支部召开支委会讨论这一任务时，一致下定决心，一定要按期或提前交出三个工作面，让领导上满意；一定要为生产创造有利条件，保证工程质量，让采煤区满意，让保安和监察部门满意；一定要把巷道掘直，让安装队满意；一定要搞好三班协作，互相不留困难，让三班工人都满意。立足全局面向生产的“五满意”运动，就在这个支委会上发起了；掘进工作的新的战术和其它重大的措施，也就在这个支委会上制定了。而后，支委会就把九个支部委员想的这些事，交给全区三百七十多人去想，去干。群众贴出了大字报，表决心，提保证，献计策，检查自己工作的缺点，提出改进的措施。于是，以“五满意”为旗帜的共产主义思想就在六百公尺的地下，变成了多快好省地完成掘进任务的巨大力量。
    为了实现五满意的口号，掘进二区是从加快速度、提高质量、加强协作这三方面使劲的。他们首先把同时掘进的九个工作面，停掘三个，维持三个，集中力量突击三个。九个支委分别到三个重点工作面的各班去“政治挂帅”，带头劳动。区长把全区掘进的红旗标兵张宝殿调到七五九八工作面作榜样，把庞俊朝青年突击队调到七三一○工作面突击。这样适当地集中力量突击重点的结果，三个工作面比矿党委提出的日期还分别提前了十天到十五天；比原计划5、6月份移交生产的时间提前了两个月左右。4月4日又提前两个月的时间完成了一个工作面。赵各压矿的工程师说，这种办法是掘进工作中的一种革新。过去分散使用力量，掘进一个工作面，一般需六个月的时间。在这期间，由于地层压力的变化，每三个月就有40％左右的支架被压断而需要修理或替换。所以每掘进一个工作面，就需要修理两次。费工又费料。采用掘进二区这种战术，每个工作面的掘进时间由六个月减到四个月，中间只需要修理一次。这样，每个工作面就能节省六十立方公尺的木材和四百个工；共可节省约五千元的成本。
    “五满意”运动以后，掘进二区的干部和党团员带动了全体职工，利用接班前后的几分钟工余时间，就随时把每个工作面的碎煤打扫得干干净净了。既为生产创造了有利条件，又为国家清理出了上千吨焦煤。掘进工人们还把工作面边界的支架改为板棚子，使采煤工人接收工作面以后，不必像过去那样再拆除支架另作板棚子。这样使每个工作面比过去提前了两三天投入生产。每个工作面早一天投入生产，就可以为国家生产一千吨左右的焦煤。
    掘进二区在“五满意”运动中还发动了“六比六看”天天插红旗的个人比赛，即比进尺看效率，比质量看规格，比安全看措施，比出勤看纪律，比团结看协作，比革新看效果。由于革命的荣誉感和革命的责任感在这里的工人身上结成了一体，他们事事都想干出新成绩，天天都争先插红旗。3月份全区三百七十个工人中就有三百四十二人插上了红旗，即92％以上的人为集体争得“五满意”这个荣誉，作出了优异的成绩，也获得了个人的荣誉。
    在开展政治鼓动工作的同时，掘进二区全体工人还响应老工人李瑞贺及袁绍江的倡议，把以每班为单位计算的计件工资制改为以三班为单位计算的计件工资制，从工资制度上促进内部协作。这样，就改变了一些工人认为给下一班创造有利条件就是“使下一班多挣钱使本班少挣钱”的思想；改变了过去在下班前作不完一件活（拿不到计件工资）就不工作的现象，而真正作到了互不留困难互相创造有利条件；三班已经不是协作关系，而是一个战斗的整体了。因此工作效率大大提高了。3月份工人的实际工资也相应的提高了10％。
    第二掘进区采取这些措施，使赵各庄矿出现了一件奇事：3月15日，矿长通知七六采煤区等有关部门验收七三一○工作面。七六采煤区的区长和技术员说：“不去看了，何必还费那个事”。原来他们因为怀疑这个工作面这样快移交生产，工程质量一定搞不好，早就暗地加以检查了：看到这个工作面和巷道，整齐的像刀切的一样。连那被视为铁面无私的“包公”的保安监察人员也说，“那巷道真该照个像，当作掘进工作面的红旗标兵。”这种不去人的验收成了最满意的验收，成了对掘进二区最大的信任和奖赏。这样的事，在全国煤矿中也是奇闻。
    3、4月份提前移交的另外三个工作面，也都做到了“五满意”。
