Tianjin, April 14th (Report from this newspaper) — The industrial system of Hebei District, Tianjin, saw the addition of over 40,000 apprentices during the Great Leap Forward in production last year. From late February, they launched a "Five Goods" competition, aiming to excel in political thought, labor and production, learning and research, respect for师傅 (Shifu) and unity, and a diligent and simple work style, thereby setting off a high tide.

The Hebei District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is deeply concerned about the growth of these new workers. Before and during the "Five Goods" competition, it instructed and assisted grassroots Youth League organizations in factories to strengthen ideological education among young apprentices, cultivating them to quickly improve their technical skills. Many factory Youth League organizations have developed plans for ideological education based on the apprentices' thoughts, lives, and work. They also mobilized the apprentices to set guarantee conditions according to the "Five Goods" requirements. The apprentices were deeply moved by the care shown by the Party and Youth League organizations and actively participated in the "Five Goods" competition. All apprentices at the Medical Equipment Factory set guarantee conditions. A new atmosphere emerged throughout the factory, with apprentices caring about politics, actively participating in labor, respecting their 师傅, and studying diligently, leading to the emergence of a large number of outstanding "Five Goods" apprentices. Among the one hundred and fifty-five apprentices in Workshop One of this factory, fifty-six were selected as outstanding "Five Goods" apprentices. The apprentices in the grinding group purchased more than thirty books and periodicals related to improving their political literacy, intensifying their studies, and constantly improving their political awareness.

Youth League organizations in many units, such as the Tianjin Machine Tool Factory, Tianjin Shoe Factory, Drilling Machine Parts Factory, and the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory of the Handicraft Bureau, also focused on improving the apprentices' technical skills. The Youth League organization of the Shoe Factory helped apprentices sign師徒 (Shifu)-apprentice contracts and guaranteed teaching and learning contracts. The 师傅 actively taught the apprentices technical skills. After the apprentices had mastered preliminary techniques, they adopted the method of "师傅 letting go" and apprentices boldly taking the lead in "production military training," which enabled the apprentices to improve their skills quickly. Currently, the vast majority of apprentices in the factory can operate independently. The standard parts group of Workshop Four of the Machine Tool Factory used the method of "boldly letting go, battlefield training," which enabled apprentices to overcome many difficulties and improve their skills in production practice, resulting in model workers such as Chen Xiulian and Li Shizhen, who overfulfilled their tasks by two times.

With the significant improvement of apprentices' technical skills, many instances of technical innovation and production improvement have also emerged among the apprentices. Zhang Guifen, Li Shuzhen, and other apprentices at the Shoe Factory, with the help of their 师傅, successfully developed a vamp stitching machine, creating conditions for the mechanization of the vamp stitching process in the shoe industry. Apprentices in the chemistry group of the Dongfeng Chemical Factory, through diligent study of technology and with the help of their 师傅, jointly researched and successfully developed a 531 insecticide with high insecticidal efficacy and fertilizer effect.

　　天津河北区充分发挥新工人的作用
　　四万徒工开展“五好”竞赛
    本报天津14日电　天津市河北区工业系统在去年生产大跃进中增加的四万多名徒工，在2月下旬，掀起了一个比政治思想好，比劳动生产好，比学习钻研好，比尊敬师傅、团结好，比勤俭朴素作风好的“五好”竞赛高潮。
    中共河北区委十分关怀这些新工人的成长，在这次“五好”竞赛前后，曾指示并帮助各工厂基层团组织加强对青年徒工的思想教育工作，培养徒工迅速提高技术水平。许多工厂的团组织都根据徒工思想、生活和劳动等方面的状况，制订了思想教育工作计划，并且发动徒工根据“五好”要求，订了保证条件。徒工们对党、团组织关怀自己的成长都深受感动，积极地投入“五好”竞赛。医疗器械厂的全部徒工都订了保证条件。全厂出现徒工关心政治、积极参加劳动、尊敬师傅、刻苦学习的新风气，涌现出了大批的“五好”优秀徒工。这个厂一车间的一百五十五名徒工中，有五十六人被评选为“五好”优秀徒工。研磨组的徒工们买了三十多本有关提高政治修养的书刊，加紧学习，不断提高自己的政治觉悟。
    天津机床厂、天津制鞋厂、钻探机零件厂和手工业局第一机床厂等许多单位的团组织，还注意提高他们的技术水平。制鞋厂团组织帮助徒工与老师傅订了师徒合同，包教保学合同。老师傅都积极地教徒工技术，他们在徒工掌握了初步技术之后，便采取师傅“大撒把”、徒工大胆干的“生产大练兵”的方法，使徒工的技术提高很快。现在全厂绝大部分徒工都能独立操作。机床厂四车间标准件小组用“大胆放手、战场练兵”的办法，使徒工们在生产实践中，克服许多困难，提高了技术，出现了超额两倍完成任务的标兵陈秀莲和李士珍。
    随着徒工技术水平的显著提高，革新技术，改进生产的事迹在徒工中也大量出现。制鞋厂徒工张桂芬、李淑珍等三人在老师傅的帮助下，研究成功一台缝帮联合机，给制鞋行业的缝帮工序实现机械化创造了条件。东风化学厂化学小组的徒工，由于刻苦钻研技术，在老师傅的帮助下，共同研究成功一种杀虫效能高、又有肥效的五三一杀虫剂。
