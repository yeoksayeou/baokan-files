　　Meticulousness
    Any work requires meticulousness.

    To do a good job in economic work, even more so requires a spirit of meticulousness. Economic work is very detailed work, and various economic tasks are interconnected. Therefore, even the slightest negligence in any link will affect oneself and impact others.

    Achieving meticulousness is not too difficult. As long as one has a high sense of responsibility towards the revolutionary cause, earnestly and seriously adheres to principles, and has the courage to face and overcome difficulties, then it can be done.

    Anhui's iron-smelting workers, when picking up their furnace pokers, thought that the pokers should be made of good steel, and good steel must be smelted from good iron. Therefore, they were determined to smelt good iron to support Shanghai. The director of the iron-smelting plant, seeing that his plant's small steel-smelting workshop was asking for good iron every day, inferred that the Shanghai steel plant needed good iron even more than he did. The comrades at the pig iron transfer station weighed pig iron thousands of times a day using small scales, patiently checking the quantity and quality. When a local factory wanted to use a few tons of pig iron outside the plan, the Provincial Planning Commission refused to approve it…

    These facts show that by consolidating the concept of the whole country as a single chessboard ideologically, one can be meticulous in action. This is the fundamental reason why Anhui's exported pig iron is of good quality and large quantity.

### 一丝不苟

　　一丝不苟
    作任何工作，都需要一丝不苟。
    要作好经济工作，就更需要一丝不苟的精神。经济工作是非常细致的工作，而且各项经济工作之间又息息相通，因此，不论那一个环节稍有疏忽，就会影响自己，牵动别人。
    做到一丝不苟，并不是太难的事。只要对革命事业具有高度负责的精神，认真严肃地坚持原则，又有面对困难、克服困难的勇气，那么就能够做到。
    安徽的炼铁工人拿起自己的炉钎来，就想到炉钎要用好钢做，好钢须用好铁炼，因此立志要炼出好铁支援上海。炼铁厂的厂长，看到本厂的小炼钢车间天天向自己要好铁，就推想到上海钢厂比自己更加需要好铁。生铁转运站的同志们，用小磅秤一天几千次地秤生铁，耐心地检查着数量又检查着质量。本地的工厂想在计划外动用几吨生铁，省计委也一概不予批准……
    这些事实说明了从思想上巩固地树立全国一盘棋的观念，在行动上就能一丝不苟。安徽外调生铁质好量多的根本原因就在于此。
