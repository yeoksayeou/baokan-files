Joint Statement by Bando Dorje and Gesang Wangdui:

    Chairman, esteemed representatives:
    We fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. We are willing to strive to fulfill the tasks proposed in these reports. We would now like to share our personal views on the issue of quelling the rebellion in the Tibet region.

    For the past eight years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the Tibetan people, patriotic figures, together with the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet and the central government's personnel stationed in Tibet, have made great efforts to implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. The former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary groups have, in every way, conspired to obstruct and undermine this effort. The Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, in order to wait for the reactionary elements to repent, have repeatedly exercised restraint to the utmost. However, they not only showed no sign of repentance but instead believed that the central government was weak and could be bullied. They colluded with British imperialists and Indian expansionists to plot and launch an armed rebellion in the Tibet region. These rebellious elements, under the guise of "protecting national religion," deceived the people while actually engaging in activities that damaged religion and harmed the people. For example, in Lozong, Changdu, the rebel elements kidnapped and beat Khen Rinpoche (a progressive figure in religious circles) and his brother, and finally killed Khen Rinpoche's brother. Furthermore, in the Bomi area, the rebels raped nuns, grabbed infants by their legs, and smashed them to death on stones. There are countless instances of such inhumane acts. This year, these rebels further kidnapped the Dalai Lama and launched armed attacks on the People's Liberation Army troops and the central government agencies stationed in Lhasa. They are the real enemies of the Tibetan people. The State Council's order on March 28, announcing the dissolution of the former Tibetan local government and the exercise of local government functions by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region to quell the rebellion, is entirely in line with the interests of the Tibetan people and is completely correct. The people of the Changdu area firmly support this.

    The so-called statement issued on April 18 in the name of the Dalai Lama, which is contrary to the facts, aims to undermine the unity of the motherland and the interests of the nation, and attempts to continue to maintain its dark feudal serf system in Tibet and further turn it into a colony or protectorate of British imperialism and Indian interventionists. We firmly oppose this.

    Tibet has historically been an inseparable part of the motherland. Since the peaceful liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it has enjoyed a new life of national equality, fraternal unity, and happiness together with the 650 million people, thereby raising the political consciousness of the Tibetan people. They will not forget the oppression and exploitation previously imposed on them by the upper-class reactionary groups in Tibet.

    The consistent implementation of the policy of national equality and freedom of religious belief by the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, as well as the respect for national customs and the active support and assistance to the Tibetan people in developing their politics, economy, and culture, and the significant achievements made, are obvious facts that not only the Tibetan monks and laypeople have personally experienced, but even the imperialists dare not deny. Is it possible that our great neighbor is not clear about this?

    The position of the Dalai Lama as the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is still reserved. We hope that he can break away from the obstruction of the reactionary elements and return to the motherland as soon as possible. Even those reactionary elements, if they can resolutely repent and return to the motherland, I think they will still receive lenient treatment from the government and the people.

    The happy new life that 1,180,000 out of Tibet's 1,200,000 people have long hoped for has finally arrived this year. We are extremely excited about this. As we move forward rapidly on the broad road to socialism, if anyone dares to obstruct us, they will be completely crushed under the iron fists of our 650 million people!

    Long live the unity of the motherland and the great unity of all nationalities!
    Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all nationalities!

### 西藏永远是中国的西藏  邦达多吉、格桑旺堆代表的联合发言

    西藏永远是中国的西藏
    邦达多吉、格桑旺堆代表的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，以及李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。并愿为实现这些报告中所提出的任务而奋斗。我们现在就关于平息西藏地区叛乱问题谈谈个人的意见。
    八年来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府的领导下，西藏人民、爱国人士与进藏人民解放军和中央派往西藏的工作人员一起，为执行关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，尽了很大的努力，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团则对此百般阴谋阻挠和破坏。中国共产党、中央人民政府为了等待反动分子的悔悟，虽然一再忍让，做到了仁至义尽，但他们不仅没有悔改之意，反而认为中央政府软弱可欺，他们与英帝国主义和印度扩张主义者互相勾结，策划和发动了西藏地区的武装叛乱。这些叛乱分子假借“保护民族宗教”来欺骗人民，实际上则干着破坏宗教、残害人民的勾当。例如，叛乱分子在昌都的洛宗将堪仁博钦（宗教界中进步人士）及他的兄弟扣押捆打，并最后杀害了堪仁博钦的兄弟。又如在波密地区叛匪轮奸尼姑，将婴儿抓住腿子倒提起来在石头上摔死等等惨无人道的情况数不胜数。今年这些叛匪进一步劫持达赖喇嘛，武装进攻在拉萨的人民解放军部队和中央驻藏机关，他们才是西藏人民真正的敌人。国务院三月二十八日明令宣布解散原西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府职权和平息叛乱的命令，是完全符合西藏人民的利益的，完全正确的。昌都地区人民对此坚决表示拥护。
    四月十八日，假借达赖喇嘛名义发表的与事实恰好相反的所谓声明，其目的在于破坏祖国统一和民族利益，企图在西藏继续维持其暗无天日的封建农奴制度，并进而变为英帝国主义和印度干涉者的殖民地或保护国，对此我们表示坚决反对。
    西藏从历史上就是祖国不可分割的一部分，和平解放以来，在中国共产党的领导下，与六亿五千万人民一起享受着民族平等、友爱团结幸福的新生活，并从而提高了西藏人民的政治觉悟。他们不会忘记以前西藏上层反动集团对他们所实行的压迫和剥削。
    中国共产党、中央人民政府一贯所实行的民族平等政策，宗教信仰自由政策，以及对民族风俗习惯的尊重和积极扶持帮助西藏人民发展政治、经济、文化等所取得的巨大成就的显明事实，这不仅是我们西藏僧俗人民的亲身体会，就是帝国主义也不敢否认这一点。难道说我国伟大的邻邦就不清楚吗？
    达赖喇嘛在西藏自治区筹备委员会的主任委员职务，现在仍予保留，我们希望他能早日摆脱反动分子的阻挠回到祖国来。就是那些反动分子，如果他们能断然悔罪，重返祖国，我想还会得到政府和人民对他们的宽大处理。
    西藏一百二十万人民中，一百一十八万人民所长期盼望的幸福的新生活，今年终于来到了，我们为此感到极大的兴奋。在我们走向社会主义的康庄大道上迅速前进的时候，如果有谁敢于阻挠，他必将在我国六亿五千万人民的铁拳下彻底粉碎！
    祖国统一各民族大团结万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
