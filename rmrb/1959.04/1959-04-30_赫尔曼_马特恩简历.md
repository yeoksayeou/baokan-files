Biography of Hermann Matern

Hermann Matern was born on June 17, 1893, into a working-class family near Magdeburg. After finishing elementary school, he went to work as a tanner in a leather factory. His entry into wage labor also marked the beginning of his political activities. At the age of fourteen, he joined the "Workers' Youth League" and later became a trade union worker for the Leather Workers' Union. In 1911, he joined the German Social Democratic Party.

After the outbreak of World War I, the German Social Democratic Party split because its leaders adopted a position of supporting the imperialist war, betraying the working class. Matern, along with many young comrades, withdrew from the Social Democratic Party. He was forced to serve in the army, and after the war, he returned to his hometown.

In 1919, Comrade Matern joined the young German Communist Party. From 1926 to 1928, he served as the trade union secretary of the German Communist Party's Magdeburg District Committee, and later as the political secretary of the Magdeburg-Anhalt District Committee. From 1931 to 1933, he served as the Party's political secretary in East Prussia. He was elected as a member of the Prussian Parliament. Throughout these years, Comrade Matern proved to be a loyal comrade of Comrade Thälmann and one of the Party's main responsible personnel, who, under the leadership of Thälmann and the Central Committee, brought Leninism to the German working class and developed the Communist Party into a revolutionary mass party.

In July 1933, Comrade Matern was arrested by the Hitler secret police and charged with so-called "treason." In September 1934, he escaped from prison and soon moved abroad according to the Party's decision, continuing the anti-fascist struggle under the instructions of the Party Central Committee.

During the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, Comrade Matern served as a teacher in an anti-fascist school in the Soviet Union. He educated many German prisoners of war, enabling them to understand the truth.

On May 1, 1945, Comrade Matern returned to Germany and, under the instructions of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, established Party organizations in Dresden. From June 1945, he served as the leader of the Party's Saxony District organization and actively strived to merge the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. After the merger of the Social Democratic Party and the German Communist Party, he served as the chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Greater Berlin. In November 1948, he was elected chairman of the Party's Central Control Commission, a significant position he has held ever since. In 1950, he was elected as a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee. Since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, he has been continuously elected as a member and vice-chairman of the People's Chamber. From November 1954, he was elected as the First Vice-Chairman.

For his outstanding contributions to the struggle for peace and socialism, he was awarded the highest state honor - the Karl Marx Order. He has also received the Gold Medal and other medals. On his sixty-fifth birthday, the President of the German Democratic Republic awarded him the title of "Hero of Labor." (Attached picture)
