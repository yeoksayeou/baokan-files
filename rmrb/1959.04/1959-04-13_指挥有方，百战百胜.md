　　Skilled Command, Unfailing Victory
　　Su Yi
　　In the South, the early rice transplanting season has arrived. The battle to seize more grain from nature has begun.
　　The tasks are heavy, the time is short, and labor is insufficient. These are the main difficulties in current agricultural production. In the face of difficulties, the correct attitude should be to advance in the face of difficulty and resolutely overcome it.
　　When climbing mountains, timid people, upon seeing towering mountains and precipitous cliffs, often feel dizzy and weak-kneed, lacking courage and determination, and naturally cannot climb any further. Brave people seize this opportunity to train their will and skills, showing their abilities and forging ahead bravely. Upon reaching the top, looking back at the journey they have climbed, they will feel that the dangers were not so formidable after all.
　　The leaders of An'yi County in Jiangxi and the suburban Liuyang People's Commune in Hunan are precisely such brave people. They are resourceful and decisive, and have not been frightened by difficulties. They mobilized the masses, found solutions, and set measures, making meticulous and thoughtful arrangements in terms of organization, ideology, and technology. Thus, insufficient labor becomes sufficient, and the transplanting task can be completed on time and with good quality. This is precisely the close combination of strategically despising difficulties and tactically valuing them. Precisely because they value difficulties and take effective measures to address them, they are even more daring to despise them.
　　What effective measures did they take? The most important thing is to distinguish between the importance and urgency of farm work, resolutely advancing what can be advanced and appropriately postponing what can be postponed. This shortens the battle line, concentrates forces, and puts them in an advantageous and active position in the most important tasks at hand, without being distracted by one thing and losing sight of another, or being in a state of confusion. After determining the main attack direction, various methods were adopted to transfer more than 80% of the labor force to the rice transplanting work, strengthening the main attack line. At the same time, logistics work was well organized, combat mobilization was carried out, and commanders at all levels went to the front line to work and fight alongside the commune members. In this way, a vigorous high-efficiency competition movement unfolded between teams, groups, and individuals.
　　From this series of leadership work, we can see both the boiling scene of this battle and the meticulous, well-organized command and dispatch. Is this not where the art of leadership lies? Being good at turning unfavorable factors into favorable ones, and being good at organizing forces to conquer the strongest fortresses, not only can the task of rice transplanting be successfully completed, but also the masses are further trained and the cadres are improved in such a battle. It is believable that they will surely create more good methods and greater victories in the future. What difficulties can stop them?

　　指挥有方，百战百胜
　　苏宜
    在南方，早稻插秧的季节已经来临。向大自然夺取更多粮食的战斗开始了。
    任务大，时间短，劳力不足，这是当前农业生产方面的主要困难。在困难面前，正确的态度应当是知难而进，坚决地克服困难。
    爬山的时候，胆小的人一见崇山峻岭，危岩绝壁，往往头晕眼花，两脚发软，没有勇气，没有决心，自然也就不可能再爬上去了。勇敢的人正好乘此锻炼自己的意志和技能，大显身手，奋勇前进。到了顶上，回头来看攀登过的路程，就会觉得也并不是什么了不起的艰险。
    江西安义县和湖南浏阳城郊人民公社的领导者正是这样的一些勇敢的人。他们多谋善断，没有被困难吓住。他们发动了群众，找出了办法，定出了措施，从组织上、思想上、技术上作了细致周到的安排。于是，劳力不足变为足够，插秧任务可以按时按质完成。——这正是把从战略上藐视困难和从战术上重视困难密切地结合了起来。正因为重视困难，针对困难采取了有力的措施，就更敢于藐视困难了。
    他们采取了哪些有力的措施呢？最主要的是把农活分清轻重缓急，能提前的坚决提前，能推后的适当推后。这就使得战线缩短，兵力集中，在当前最主要的任务方面处于优势，居于主动地位，不至于顾此失彼，手忙脚乱。确定了主攻方向以后，就采取了各种办法，抽调80％以上的劳力投入栽秧工作，加强主攻战线；同时，很好地组织了后勤工作，进行了战斗动员，而且各级指挥员亲临前线，和社员一起劳动，一起战斗。这样，队与队、组与组、人与人之间轰轰烈烈的高工效竞赛运动就展开了。
    从这一连串的领导工作中，我们既可以看到这一场战斗的沸腾的场面，又可以看到细致周密而又井井有条的指挥调度。领导的艺术难道不就在这里吗？善于变不利因素为有利因素，善于组织兵力攻克最坚强的堡垒，不仅可以胜利完成插秧的任务，而且在这样一场战斗中进一步锻炼了群众，提高了干部。可以相信，他们今后必能创造更多的好办法和更大的胜利。有什么困难能挡住他们呢？
