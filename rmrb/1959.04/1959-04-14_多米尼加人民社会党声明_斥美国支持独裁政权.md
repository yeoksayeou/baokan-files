　　Xinhua News Agency, April 13th, Trujillo City Dispatch: The Dominican People's Socialist Party recently issued a statement condemning recent remarks by U.S. Army Chief of Staff Taylor, whose purpose was to support dictatorial regimes in Latin America. In his remarks, Taylor insisted that the desire of the people of Latin American countries for national independence, democracy, freedom, and improved living conditions was a threat to U.S. "security."
    The statement said that the purpose of imperialism's overall policy in the Caribbean region is to support authoritarian regimes in various countries and weaken democratic governments. The policy of supporting autocrats and helping reactionaries is causing increasing anger among the people of our countries, and the movement to resolutely oppose autocratic rule will expand day by day.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 11th, Trujillo Dispatch: The Dominican "Resistance Newspaper" recently criticized U.S. naval ships for entering Dominican ports under the pretext of so-called "informal visits" and "allowing sailors to rest," in order to interfere in the internal affairs of this country.
