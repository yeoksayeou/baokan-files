Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd: The Chinese Red Cross Society today sent a telegram to the Japanese Red Cross Society, strongly protesting the behavior of Mr. Inoue Masutaro, Foreign Affairs Director of the Japanese Red Cross Society, who, in order to obstruct the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, has resorted to fabricating lies and slandering the Chinese people. The telegram reads as follows: To the Japanese Red Cross Society:

    In the promotional material "The Korean Repatriation Issue" authored by Mr. Inoue Masutaro, your Foreign Affairs Director, we were shocked to discover the following sentence:
      "There are many Chinese people who hate Japan and returned to mainland China. Some of them, due to shattered illusions, have illegally returned to Japan and are now being detained in detention centers."
    We believe that this is completely groundless. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, more than 5,000 overseas Chinese have returned from Japan. Under the warm care of the motherland's government and people, their desire to participate in the construction of the motherland has been realized, and they are living a peaceful and happy life. Only a few individuals, because their Japanese wives were not accustomed to the climate and lifestyle in China, or due to other problems, were allowed to go to Japan with their wives through arrangements made by the Chinese Red Cross Society and the three Japanese organizations. Apart from this, no other overseas Chinese have gone directly from China to Japan. The Society has always respected the opinions of the three Japanese organizations in this regard and obtained their prior consent. How can it be said that they entered the country illegally? Mr. Inoue knows all this. We cannot help but ask: The Chinese Red Cross Society (and the three Japanese organizations) has done a great deal of work in assisting Japanese relatives to visit family members, assisting Japanese war criminals to return to their country, returning the remains of Japanese people, and inquiring about Japanese people in China and forwarding letters and packages to them over the years. There are many valuable experiences among them that the Japanese Red Cross Society can learn from in assisting the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. Why does Mr. Inoue not mention any of these things but instead creates something out of nothing to confuse the public? Mr. Inoue's actions give us reason to suspect that he is acting on the instructions of the Kishi Nobusuke government, with ulterior motives to find an excuse for conducting "screening" among Korean residents in Japan who are willing to return to their country.
    We believe that "screening" can only be a tactic to obstruct Korean residents in Japan from freely expressing their desire to return to their country. If the free will of Korean residents in Japan to return to their country is truly respected, there is no need for any "screening" at all. We are extremely disappointed by the Japanese Red Cross Society's two-faced approach of being willing to assist Korean residents in Japan to return to their country on the one hand, and using "screening" to obstruct them on the other. According to the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross, all Korean residents in Japan who are willing to return to their country should be assisted to return home without "screening."
    We are extremely indignant at Mr. Inoue for fabricating lies and slandering the Chinese people in order to achieve the purpose of "screening." In addition to lodging a strong protest, we solemnly request your society to correct this. Otherwise, your society will be responsible for all consequences.
      Chinese Red Cross Society, April 3rd

### 日本红十字会造谣诬蔑我国人民  我红十字会提出强烈抗议

    日本红十字会造谣诬蔑我国人民
    我红十字会提出强烈抗议
    新华社3日讯　中国红十字会今天致电日本红十字会，强烈抗议日本红十字会外事部长井上益太郎为达到阻挠朝鲜侨民回国的目的不惜造谣诬蔑中国人民的行为。电文如下：日本红十字会：
    在贵会外事部长井上益太郎先生所著“朝鲜人遣返问题”的宣传品中，我们惊讶地发现这样的辞句：
      “有许多憎恶日本的中国人，回到了中国大陆，其中有些人由于幻想破灭，又非法跑回日本，现被拘留在看守所里。”
    我们认为这完全是没有根据的。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，从日本回国的华侨有五千多名，他们在祖国政府和人民的热情关怀下，参加祖国建设的愿望已经实现，过着和平、愉快的生活。其中只有个别人，由于日籍妻子对中国气候和生活不习惯，或其他问题，经过中国红十字会和日本三团体的安排，同意他们同妻子去日本，此外再没有从中国直接去日本的华侨。本会在这方面一向尊重日本三团体的意见，事先获得它们的同意。怎么能说他们是非法入境呢？这都是井上先生知道的。我们不禁要问：中国红十字会（和日本三团体）在协助日侨探亲妇女和日本战争犯罪分子回国、送还日本人遗骨和查询在华日本人和为他们转递信件包裹等，几年来作了不少的工作，其中有许多值得日本红十字会在协助朝侨回国工作中吸取的有益经验。对于这些事井上先生为什么只字不提反而在那里无中生有混淆视听呢？井上先生的做法，使我们有理由怀疑他是秉承岸信介政府之意，别有用心地为在愿意回国的朝鲜侨民中进行“甄别”寻找借口。
    我们认为“甄别”实际上只能是阻挠朝鲜侨民自由表示回国愿望的一种手法。如果真正尊重朝侨回国的自由意志，是无须乎进行任何
  “甄别”。我们对于日本红十字会一方面愿意协助旅日朝侨回国，一方面又要以“甄别”来进行阻挠的这种两面手法，感到极大的遗憾。按照红十字人道主义原则，所有愿意回国的朝侨，应当不加“甄别”地全部协助他们回国。
    对井上先生为达到“甄别”目的不惜造谣诬蔑中国人民，我们感到无比愤慨。除提出强烈抗议外，并郑重要求贵会予以更正，否则贵会应对一切后果负责。
      中国红十字会　四月三日
