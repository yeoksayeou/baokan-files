Dare to Express Independent Opinions
A Few Thoughts on Volume 1 of “A Draft History of Modern China”
He Bingran

“A Draft History of Modern China,” compiled by Dai Yi, consists of three volumes. The first volume has been published by the People's Publishing House. In this volume, the author mainly elaborates on three issues: first, the world and China before 1840; second, the beginning of China's semi-colonialization after the Opium War; and third, the entire process of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary war. Because class contradictions were the primary factor in society during this period, the author used more than three-fifths of the book to focus on the victory, failure, and historical significance of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution. Through these discussions, readers can clearly see how heroic and resolute the Chinese people's revolutionary will against imperialism and feudalism has always been. After the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, the Chinese feudal forces had to rely on foreign aid, and foreign invaders began to increasingly combine with the Chinese feudal forces. From then on, the Chinese people could no longer simply oppose feudalism, but had to oppose aggression at the same time, and put the fight against aggression first.

This book has several characteristics, the most important of which is that the author dares to express his own independent opinions on some issues that are debated in the field of history, and many of these opinions are put forward after relatively careful research by the author. For example, views on the sprouts of capitalism in China, the exploration of the reasons for the failure of the Opium War, views on the nature of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, interpretations of whether the "Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty" of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was actually implemented, opinions on whether the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom should emphasize "opposing the Manchus but not Confucius" and reduce the mention of the Heavenly Father and other heretical superstitions after leaving Guangxi, and explanations on the emergence of the Likin system in the Qing Dynasty, etc. This approach is helpful in carrying out the "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" policy in the field of modern Chinese history, and is therefore worthy of promotion.

However, these views are not all very mature, and some need more thorough argumentation. For example, on the issue of the nature of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, there have always been different views in the historical community. The author initially believed that the handicraftsmen at that time were "embryonic proletarians" and that they played a promoting role in the revolution (page 163); however, the author later admitted that a large number of handicraftsmen rose up against the revolution in the later period of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (page 516). In this way, the latter fact seems to contradict the author's emphasis on the role of handicraftsmen in the revolution. Furthermore, regarding the issue of the sprouts of capitalism in China in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, there have always been different views in the historical community. The author believes that at that time, "capitalist manufactories had already occurred in various handicraft production departments" (page 31). His main basis is twofold: first, many industrial sectors saw the emergence of manufactories and putting-out merchants at that time, and many manufactories had a large scale and detailed division of labor, etc.; second, Marx once said in "Capital": "A relatively large number of laborers working simultaneously, in the same place (or in the same workplace), under the command of the same capitalist, producing the same type of commodity, is historically and conceptually the starting point of capitalist production." However, the author does not explain the relationship between the manufactories and the guild system at that time, nor does he explain whether there is a distinction between "capitalist enterprises" and "the starting point of capitalist production," so the argumentation is not strong enough.

    勇于发表自己独立的见解
    对“中国近代史稿”第一卷的一点看法
    何炳然
    戴逸编著的“中国近代史稿”，全书共三卷。第一卷已由人民出版社出版。在这卷书里，作者主要阐述了三个问题：第一，1840年以前的世界和中国；第二，鸦片战争以后中国社会的开始半殖民地化；第三，太平天国革命战争的全部过程。由于这个时期社会上阶级矛盾还占主要地位，所以作者几乎用了五分之三以上的篇幅，着重地论述了太平天国革命的胜利、失败和它的历史意义。通过这些论述，读者可以比较清楚地看到：中国人民反帝反封建的革命意志，从来就是多么地英勇和坚决。太平天国革命以后，中国封建势力不得不借重外国的援助，外国侵略者开始日益同中国的封建势力相结合。从此，中国人民就不能单纯地反封建，而必须同时反侵略，而且要把反侵略提到第一位了。
    本书具有一些特点，最主要的是作者对于史学界一些存在争论的问题，都能勇于发表自己独立的见解，其中有不少见解都是作者经过比较认真研究以后提出来的。例如，关于中国资本主义萌芽的看法，关于鸦片战争失败原因的探讨，关于太平天国革命性质的观点，关于太平天国“天朝田亩制度”到底曾否实行的阐释，关于太平天国打出广西以后应不应强调“反满不反孔”、少提天父一类邪教迷信的意见，以及关于清代厘金制度出现的说明，等等。这样做法是有助于在中国近代史领域中开展百家争鸣的，因而是值得提倡的。
    但是，这些见解并不都是很成熟的，有的还需要作更充分的论证。例如，关于太平天国革命性质的问题，史学界一直存在着不同的观点。作者起初认为当时的手工业工人是“无产阶级萌芽”，他们在革命中曾经起了推动作用（一六三页）；但是，作者后来又承认在太平天国后期曾经有成批的手工业工人起来反对革命（五一六页）。这样，后面的事实同作者强调手工业工人在革命中所起的作用就显得有些矛盾。又如，关于十八世纪和十九世纪初期中国资本主义萌芽的问题，史学界一直也存在着不同的观点。作者是认为当时“已经在各个手工业生产部门中发生了资本主义性质的手工场”的（三一页）。他的主要根据有二，一是当时许多工业部门出现了手工工场和包买商人，并且许多手工工场都有很大规模和细密分工，等等；二是马克思曾经在“资本论”中说过：“较多数劳动者在同时，在同地（或在同一工作场所），在同一资本家的命令下，生产同种商品，在历史上和在概念上，都是资本主义生产的出发点。”但是，作者没有说明当时的手工工场同行会制度的关系如何，也没有说明“资本主义的企业”同“资本主义生产的出发点”是否有其区别，因此在论证上就不够有力。
