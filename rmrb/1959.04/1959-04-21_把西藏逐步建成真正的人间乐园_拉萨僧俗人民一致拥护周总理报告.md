Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 20th: Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report at the National People's Congress, addressing the issue of thoroughly quelling the rebellion in Tibet, has greatly encouraged the monks and laypeople of all circles here. People unanimously support Premier Zhou's report and express their determination to resolutely quell the rebellion under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, clear the obstacles on the road ahead, quickly realize national regional autonomy, and gradually carry out democratic reforms in order to build the Tibetan plateau into a true paradise on earth.

      Pabala Gelielangjie Living Buddha, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, delivered a speech expressing his heartfelt support for Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. He said, "Destroying the unity of the motherland only benefits imperialism, while safeguarding the unity of the motherland benefits all ethnic groups in China, including the Tibetan people. The 'autonomy' spoken of by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique is actually a demand for the 'freedom' to secede from the motherland. In the past, they always attempted to drive away the representatives and staff of the Central People's Government in Tibet and did not want the leadership of the Central People's Government. What the majority of the Tibetan people want is national regional autonomy under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government. These two are fundamentally different and have nothing in common."

      Pabala Living Buddha said that he especially supported Premier Zhou's report that the unity of the motherland is the highest interest of all nationalities and that Tibet should quickly realize national regional autonomy and gradually carry out democratic reforms. He said, "The former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, colluding with imperialism to launch an armed rebellion, aimed to maintain the interests of a small number of themselves. The rebels spread rumors that after the democratic reforms, the people would have no food to eat and no religious freedom. In fact, they were妄想(wang xiang; daydreaming or delusional) to harm the common people as they did in the past, doing whatever they wanted, and suppressing and exploiting the people lawlessly. Now, the majority of people have clearly realized that this small group of reactionaries is not protecting religion, but only wants to continue their dark rule."

      Pabala Living Buddha finally said: "In the past, due to the obstruction of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, democratic reforms were delayed for several years without being carried out. Now, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Government's full consideration of Tibet's conditions to gradually carry out reforms, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will undertake this task, and I am very happy."

      Sangpo Tenzin Wangchuk (Tibetan), Deputy Commander of the Tibet Military Region, who was wounded by the rebels and has now recovered after treatment, said, "Premier Zhou's passage on the Tibetan issue in his government work report is completely in line with the views of the Tibetan people. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central Government granted the Tibetan people the right to autonomy. In April 1956, under the leadership and assistance of the Central Government, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established. All work related to Tibet, whether large or small, was fully consulted and discussed by all members (more than 90% of whom are Tibetan), and we must seek consensus. I am a standing member of the Preparatory Committee, and I know the situation well. The Central Government has never forced us Tibetan members to pass or implement programs they disagree with." He said, "Some time ago, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique deliberately distorted the facts, deceived the people, and said that the Central Government did not allow Tibetan local autonomy. Now, a small group of traitors who have fled abroad are still singing this absurdity. The facts cannot be erased. It is they themselves who are destroying Tibetan autonomy."

      Talking about the issue of social reform in Tibet, Sangpo Tenzin Wangchuk said, "The Central Government has always adopted the method of peaceful consultation on the issue of reform in Tibet." He pointed out: "Reform is in line with the wishes of the broad masses of Tibetan working people, and it is wrong to go against the people's wishes. The former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique attempted to use the interests of a few people to hinder everyone's happiness." Sangpo Tenzin Wangchuk finally said: "I come from a large landlord family and inherited the ancestral family and property from an early age. In the past, I felt honored about my landlord family and landlord status. In recent years, due to the great changes in the world situation and the motherland, I began to be dissatisfied with this landlord family and no longer wanted to be a landlord." He said, "With the wishes of the Tibetan people and the development of the world situation and the motherland, today I fully agree with reform and agree with Premier Zhou's statement in his report to use consultation to decide the time, steps, and methods of implementing reform."

      Some residents and lamas in Lhasa also held forums, resolutely supporting Premier Zhou's report. Some residents in the Fifth District said at the forum: The former Tibetan local government cruelly oppressed us, using whips and sticks to deal with us. In the past, we lived like cattle and horses. We resolutely demand a thorough quelling of the rebellion and the gradual implementation of democratic reforms to build a democratic and happy new Tibet. After hearing the content of Premier Zhou's report, the lamas of Drepung Monastery expressed their sincere support. They said that the imperialists' rumor that the Central People's Government is "destroying religion" here can only be believed by demons. The lamas also angrily condemned the rebels who were engaged in adultery, arson, and murder while wearing kasayas, believing that their behavior was intolerable by both national law and Buddhist precepts.

      Now, people from all walks of life in Lhasa are also organizing to study and discuss Premier Zhou's report. People in other towns in Tibet are also preparing to widely study Premier Zhou's report.

    把西藏逐步建成真正的人间乐园
    拉萨僧俗人民一致拥护周总理报告
    新华社拉萨20日电　周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会会议上所作的政府工作报告中谈到彻底平息西藏叛乱问题，使这里的各界僧俗人民受到极大的鼓舞。人们一致拥护周总理的报告，表示要在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，坚决平息叛乱，扫清前进道路上的障碍，迅速实现民族地方自治，并且逐步进行民主改革，以便把西藏高原建设成一个真正的人间乐园。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰活佛发表谈话，衷心拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告。他说：“破坏祖国的统一只符合帝国主义的利益，而维护祖国的统一才符合中国各族人民包括西藏人民的利益。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团他们所说的‘自治’，实际上是要求有叛离祖国的‘自由’。他们过去一直企图赶走中央人民政府在西藏的代表和工作人员，并且不要中央人民政府的领导。而我们西藏大多数人民所要求的自治是在中央人民政府统一领导下的民族地方自治。这二者根本是两回事，毫无共同之处。”
    帕巴拉活佛说，他特别拥护周总理报告中所说的祖国统一是全国各民族的最高利益以及使西藏迅速实现民族地方自治和逐步进行民主改革的话。他说：“原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义发动武装叛乱，目的是为了保持他们少数人自身的利益。叛乱分子造谣说，民主改革以后，人民将没有饭吃和没有宗教自由。实际上，他们是妄想和过去一样地残害老百姓，为所欲为，无法无天地压制和剥削人民。现在大多数人已经认识清楚，这一小撮反动分子不是在保护宗教，而只是想继续他们的黑暗统治。”
    帕巴拉活佛最后说：“过去由于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的阻挠，民主改革拖了好几年一直没有进行。现在依据中央充分照顾西藏的条件逐步进行改革的精神，西藏自治区筹备委员会将把这个任务担当起来，我感到非常高兴。”
    曾被叛乱分子打伤，经过治疗现已痊愈的西藏军区副司令员桑颇·才旺仁增（藏族）发表谈话说：“周总理政府工作报告中关于西藏问题的一段话，完全和西藏人民的看法一致。西藏和平解放以后，中央就给予了西藏人民以自治的权利。1956年4月在中央的领导和帮助下，成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，有关西藏的工作，不管是大的还是小的，都是经过全体委员（其中90％以上是藏族）的充分协商讨论，务必求得意见一致。我是筹委会的常务委员，经过情况我全知道，中央从来没有强制我们藏族委员通过或执行他所不同意的方案。”他说：“前些时候，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团有意歪曲事实，欺骗人民，说中央不允许西藏地方自治，现在潜逃国外的一小撮叛国分子仍在高唱这一谰调。事实是不能抹煞的，破坏西藏自治的正是他们自己。”
    谈到西藏的社会改革问题时，桑颇·才旺仁增说：“中央对于西藏的改革问题，一贯采取和平协商的办法。”他指出：“改革是切合广大西藏劳动人民的愿望的，违背人民的这种愿望是错误的。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团就是企图用少数人的利益来妨碍大家的幸福。”桑颇·才旺仁增最后说：“我是个大地主出身，从小就继承了祖传的世家和产业。从前，我对自己这个地主家庭和地主身份还感到荣誉。近几年来，由于世界形势和祖国的大变化，我对这个地主家庭开始不满意，也不愿再当地主了。”他说：“随着西藏人民的愿望以及世界形势和祖国的变化发展，今天我完全赞同改革，赞同周总理在报告中所说的用协商的方法来决定实行改革的时间、步骤和办法。”
    拉萨市有些居民和喇嘛也举行了座谈会，坚决拥护周总理的报告。第五区一些居民在座谈会上说：原西藏地方政府残酷压榨我们，用鞭子和棍子对付我们，从前我们都过着牛马般的生活。我们坚决要求彻底平息叛乱，并逐步实行民主改革，建设民主、幸福的新西藏。哲蚌寺的喇嘛们在听到周总理报告的内容以后，纷纷表示真诚拥护，他们说，帝国主义造谣中央人民政府在这里“破坏宗教”，那只有魔鬼才能相信。喇嘛们还愤怒地谴责了那些披着袈裟进行奸淫烧杀的叛乱分子，认为他们的行为是国法和佛教教规所不容的。
    现在，拉萨市其他各阶层人士也都在纷纷组织学习和座谈周总理的报告。西藏其他各城镇的人民，也准备广泛地学习周总理的报告。
