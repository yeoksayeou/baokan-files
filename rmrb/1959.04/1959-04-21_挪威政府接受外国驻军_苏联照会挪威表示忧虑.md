Xinhua News Agency, 20th April. Moscow dispatch: The Soviet government's note to Norway regarding the establishment of foreign military bases in Norway was delivered to the Norwegian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Gundersen, on the 16th by the Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko.

The note emphasizes that the Norwegian government's permission for the so-called non-permanent stationing of foreign armed forces on Norwegian territory in peacetime is a betrayal of its previous position on this issue, particularly the position stated in the Soviet-Norwegian communiqué published on November 16, 1955. The note states that the policy of establishing NATO bases on Norwegian territory seriously damages the relations between the Soviet Union and Norway.

The note states that the Soviet government cannot but pay attention to this policy of the Norwegian government because it contains serious consequences.

The note points out that the Norwegian government's concessions to the demands of West German militarists, allowing Norwegian territory to be used as a military base for West German troops, have caused deep concern to the Soviet government. Satisfying the ambitions of the West German militarist clique is contrary to the interests of the peace and security of the people of Europe, especially the people of Northern Europe.

The note emphasizes that the Soviet government is expressing these views entirely out of the interests of strengthening peace in Europe, particularly in Northern Europe, and also out of the interests of developing good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Norway. Norway should value these relations no less than the Soviet Union does.

The Soviet government hopes that the Norwegian government will give due consideration to the reasons stated in the note and refrain from taking measures that may have serious consequences for the cause of peace in Northern Europe.

    挪威政府接受外国驻军
    苏联照会挪威表示忧虑
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府就在挪威建立外国军事基地问题给挪威的照会已于16日由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯交给挪威驻苏联大使甘德森。
    照会强调指出，挪威政府允许外国武装部队在和平时期所谓非永久性的驻扎在挪威领土上，是背弃它以前在这个问题上的立场，特别是在1955年11月16日发表的苏挪公报中申明的立场。照会说，在挪威领土上建立北大西洋公约组织基地的政策，严重损害苏联和挪威两国的关系。
    照会说，苏联政府不能不注意挪威政府的这种政策，因为它包含着严重的后果。
    照会指出，挪威政府对西德军国主义者的要求的让步，允许挪威领土作为西德军队的军事基地，这引起苏联政府的深切忧虑。满足西德军国主义集团的这种野心，是违背欧洲各国人民，特别是北欧各国人民的和平和安全的利益的。
    照会强调指出，苏联政府说出自己的这些看法完全是出于加强欧洲，特别是北欧和平的利益，同时也是出于发展苏联和挪威睦邻关系的利益。挪威对这种关系的珍视决不应该亚于苏联。
    苏联政府希望挪威政府对照会中陈述的理由予以应有的重视，不要采取可能给北欧和平事业造成严重后果的措施。
