    Golden Bridge Jade Belt
    Tibetan, Cāzhū Āwàng Luòsāng
    Amazing, look!
    Tier upon tier of heaven-pillar-like mountains,
    Surging waves, torrent after torrent,
    Cut off the transportation routes of Kang, Qing, and Tibet.
    Stone walls hang high like mirrors, each more precipitous than the last;
    Even eagles would flap their wings in fright if they tried to fly over!
    Look, that vast grassland, connecting heaven and earth into one;
    Even if you're as swift as the wind, day after day,
    You still can't reach its edge.
    Hot wind blows like flames,
    Cold air shoots out, making people's hands and feet stiff, chest and back cold;
    You don't need to see it to be terrified just by hearing about it!
    Chairman Mao's call,
    Struck a chord in the heart of every brother in the road-building team.
    To build golden bridges and jade belts on the heaven-pillars, torrents, and vast grasslands,
    Braving the scorching heat and bitter cold, the heroes launched a fierce battle!
    Resisting the wind and rain, with only tents,
    And on the high mountains, their drink and food, only --
    Water that won't boil, rice that won't cook.
    Explosives rang out on the precipitous cliffs,
    Long bridges were to be built over ancient ravines and natural barriers,
    The heroes' flesh and blood often flowed with the crushed rocks, the waves splashing!
    Difficulties filled the blue sky like dark clouds,
    The heroes' wisdom and courage finally blew the dark clouds to the ocean.
    The long wind of victory swept across the lovely mountains and rivers,
    In the blink of an eye,
    The Lhasa River Bridge, connected the north and south banks of several bends,
    From now on, Kangqing Tibet, the plateau of the motherland, became one!
    The road-building team reunited, conquering the perils of heaven and earth,
    Brothers of the Han and Tibetan nationalities,
    In Lhasa People's Square:
    Shaking hands, embracing, meeting cordially.
    The endless convoys, flew over the heaven-pillars, torrents, and grasslands, thanks to the golden bridges and jade belts,
    Full of glory, also met here.
    Is that cheering? Or debating?
    Is that embracing? Or wrestling?
    Is that the murmur of cars? Or the songs of all ethnic groups?
    My wet old eyes, have no strength to distinguish!
    That is cheering, they completed Chairman Mao's call;
    That is embracing, they symbolize the unity and consummation of the Han and Tibetan nationalities;
    That is the murmur of cars, and also the songs of all ethnic groups;
    Because this heart of mine, has unspeakable,
    Endless, uncontrollable joy!
    Look! That elephant-like slowly driving fleet of cars,
    Listen! That roaring of locomotives,
    Is a rhythmic music,
    And also a deep and meaningful murmur!
    From the low singing,
    I clearly heard the following sounds:
    Our brother convoys all came from the mainland,
    Conquered nature, walked through the golden bridges and jade belts,
    Experienced all kinds of hardships before arriving.
    Relying on Chairman Mao's love for the Tibetan people,
    The care of the Central Government, the heroic road-building army,
    And the support and reception of the Tibetan people along the way: we were able to come!
    In order to build a new Tibet,
    So that the economic flowers of the borderlands, also bloom fragrantly,
    Eliminate backwardness, and let the future shine with glory: we came!
    Please listen to our songs, outstanding Tibetan people:
    Don't forget Chairman Mao's teachings,
    Don't forget the glorious name of the People's Liberation Army,
    Don't forget the imperialists' conspiracies and sabotage,
    Don't forget that national unity must be strengthened!
    We must always be intimately of one heart,
    Like water and milk blending, like the trunk and branches tightly connected to the roots!
    The thought of patriotism, is as firm as Mount Sumeru!
    We must be masters of our own house, and quickly build a new Tibet of the motherland!
    The song of the locomotive has not yet stopped,
    My heart, like a white dove, has already flown far to Beijing!
    [Editor's Note] The author of this poem, Cāzhū Āwàng Luòsāng, is a famous scholar and poet in Tibet, who used to be a Living Buddha in a monastery. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, he participated in the work of the Compilation and Editing Committee of the Tibet Military Region, and later served as the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Tibet Daily. He did a lot of work for anti-imperialism, patriotism, unity and progress. He used his moving poems to praise the new era, the Communist Party and the leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao. Although he was old and weak, he still spared no effort to study and work actively. Because of his love for the motherland and opposition to secession, he aroused the hatred of the reactionary groups in the upper echelons of Tibet. At the end of September 1957, on his way to work, he was punched and knocked to the ground by reactionary elements. After ineffective treatment, he unfortunately passed away on December 1, at the age of seventy-eight.

    金桥玉带
    藏族　擦珠·阿旺洛桑
    神奇呀，你看！
    一重又一重天柱般的高山，
    浪涛汹涌，一道道的激流，
    截断了康、青、藏的交通路线。
    石壁高悬如镜面，一处比一处陡险；
    想要飞过，神雕的翅膀也要打颤！
    看，那宽广的草原，把天地连成一片；
    任你是健步如飞，一天又一天，
    都走不到它的边缘。
    热风吹起像火焰，
    寒气射来，叫人们手足僵硬、胸背冷穿；
    不须亲眼见，只听了也会心惊胆战！
    毛主席的召唤，
    敲响了修路队伍里每个兄弟们的心弦。
    为要在天柱、激流、广阔的草原上筑起金桥玉带，
    冒着酷暑严寒，英雄们展开了激战！
    抵抗狂风暴雨，只有帐幔，
    高山上的饮和食，只有——
    煮不沸的水，烧不熟的饭。
    悬岩削壁上的炸药响连天，
    一座座的长桥要架过古壑天堑，
    英雄们的血肉，常随同碎石奔流，浪花飞溅！
    困难像乌云布满了蓝色天，
    英雄们的智勇的大风终于把乌云刮到海洋那边。
    胜利的长风吹遍了可爱的山川，
    弹指间，
    拉萨河大桥，连接了几曲的南北两岸，
    从今后成了一片，康青藏啊，祖国的高原！
    修路队伍大团圆，征服了天险、地险，
    汉藏两族的兄弟们，
    在拉萨人民广场上：
    握手、拥抱、亲切会见。
    车队连绵，借金桥玉带飞越过天柱、激流，和草原，
    满载光荣，也在这儿会了面。
    那是在欢呼？还是在论辩？
    是拥抱？还是在摔掼？
    是汽车的低吟？还是各族人民的歌赞？
    我这润湿的老眼啊，没有力量分辨！
    那是在欢呼，他们完成了毛主席的召唤；
    那是在拥抱，他们象征着汉藏民族的团结圆满；
    那是汽车的低吟，也是各族人民的歌赞；
    因为我这一颗心，有说不出，
    诉不尽，按不住的喜欢！
    看吧！那巨象般缓缓驶来的车群，
    听吧！那机车的隆隆吼声，
    是一曲有节奏的音乐，
    也是含义深远的低吟！
    从低低的歌唱里，
    我清晰地听到了下面的声音：
    我们兄弟车队都从内地来，
    战胜了自然，走过了金桥玉带，
    历尽了万苦千辛才到来。
    依靠毛主席对藏胞的慈爱，
    中央的关怀，神勇的修路大军，
    沿途藏胞的支援、接待：我们才能来！
    为了建设新西藏，
    使边疆的经济花朵，也郁郁地喷香，
    消灭落后，让前途放出光辉：我们才来！
    请听我们的歌声，藏族优秀的人民：
    莫忘了毛主席的教训，
    莫忘了解放军的英名，
    莫忘了帝国主义的阴谋破坏，
    莫忘了民族内部要团结紧！
    我们要永远亲密一条心，
    像水乳交融，像树干、枝叶紧紧地连着根！
    爱国主义的思想，坚固得和须弥山一样！
    要当家作主，赶快建设祖国的新西藏！
    机车的歌声尚未停，
    我心如白鸽，已经远飞去北京！
