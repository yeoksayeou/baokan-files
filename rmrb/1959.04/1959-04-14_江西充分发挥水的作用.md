　　Jiangxi Fully Utilizes the Role of Water

　　Simultaneous construction, acceptance, and water storage allow newly built projects to take effect immediately;
　　Strengthen maintenance and management, strive for rational water use, and improve water utilization rates;
　　Use field areas, mountain streams, mountain gullies, and small ponds to store water and expand irrigation areas.
    (Our newspaper, Nanchang, 13th dispatch) How can newly built water conservancy projects take effect immediately? How can we fully expand irrigation areas and improve water utilization rates? Jiangxi Province has summarized and absorbed past experiences and adopted three methods: first, simultaneous construction, acceptance, water storage, and benefit; second, planned water use; third, using field ridges, pits, mountain gullies, etc., to store water. By adopting these measures, not only have the newly built projects been effective immediately, but the benefited area has also been expanded by five million mu, and the drought resistance capacity of water conservancy projects on 3.2 million mu of farmland has been increased by fifty days.
    Jiangxi Province completed 460 million cubic meters of earth and stone work last winter and this spring, building more than 92,000 various water conservancy projects, which can expand the irrigation area by 5.3 million mu and improve the irrigation area by 7.5 million mu. So far, adding the existing water conservancy facilities, 42.2 million mu out of the province's 44 million mu of arable land can be irrigated, and only 1.8 million mu still lack water conservancy facilities. In order to ensure a bumper harvest this year, all parts of the province, through summarizing the experience of past water conservancy work and absorbing the experience of old farmers, have taken measures from two aspects—making newly built projects effective immediately and expanding the benefited area—to make up for the deficiency of 1.8 million mu lacking water conservancy facilities.
    The method to make newly built projects effective immediately is simultaneous completion, acceptance, water storage, and benefit. In the past, water storage and effectiveness could only be achieved after the entire project was completed. Often, because construction started late, it was completed after rice transplanting, missing the spring rain water storage season, resulting in failure to store water or insufficient water storage, so that the benefits were small or could not be realized in that year. According to statistics, 15% of the projects built last winter and spring were ineffective or had very little effect for this reason. In order to change this situation, after Jiangxi started water conservancy construction early last winter, it adopted the following method: for large-scale projects completed in stages, the inner slope was built first and the outer slope later, in order to strive for early water storage; for medium-sized projects, a part was built, a part was accepted, and a part was stored with water, so that when the whole project was completed, it was also fully accepted and filled with water; for small projects, one place was built, one place was accepted, and one place was stored with water. As a result, all of the more than 90,000 projects completed so far in the province have been filled with water and have immediately played a role in spring plowing. This year, Chongren County, due to the adoption of the above-mentioned methods, the newly built 685 projects have now reached the state of full ponds, full reservoirs, and full pools. Every project is full of water, and there is water for irrigation in the spring plowing even with less rainfall, so that the early rice fields can be dissolved and plowed in time.
    Strengthening maintenance and management and scientific water use are important measures taken by Jiangxi Province to improve water utilization rates and expand the benefited area. According to calculations, after the implementation of this measure, the water use rate of all projects in the province can be increased by 5%, which is equivalent to increasing the irrigated area by 2 million mu. These measures are: first, strengthen ideological education to establish the idea and atmosphere of "storing water, protecting water, managing water, and cherishing water" among the broad masses of commune members; second, establish management organizations at all levels, assign special personnel to manage each project, and formulate maintenance systems to ensure frequent inspection and repair; third, learn from the experience of old farmers and implement shallow irrigation, frequent irrigation, and rotational irrigation to prevent water wastage phenomena such as flooding and full irrigation; fourth, implement the "four divisions and four determinations" water use method, that is, dividing the project to determine the fields, dividing the fields to determine the water, dividing the irrigation area to determine the management personnel, and dividing the crops to determine the amount of water, so as to achieve planned water use and ensure uninterrupted irrigation of every piece of land; fifth, rational and economical use of water, releasing water nearby and releasing water according to the water source, releasing low water to low fields and high water to high fields, releasing low pond water first and then high pond water, using living water first and then stagnant water, irrigating yellow seedlings first and then green seedlings, saving early seedlings first and then late seedlings, so that the amount of water used is appropriate and timely, which not only meets the needs of crops but also saves water consumption; sixth, reorganize the canal system to connect reservoirs and ponds, connect reservoirs and dams, connect rivers and canals, connect reservoirs and canals, form long vines to bear melons, store water in sections, and unify irrigation, so as to adjust water sources and balance water potential; seventh, add and improve drainage and irrigation tools, vigorously promote wind and water powered waterwheels, and improve water lifting efficiency; eighth, establish responsibility systems and reward systems for management personnel and water release personnel to strengthen and encourage their sense of responsibility and enthusiasm.
    At present, all parts of Jiangxi Province are implementing the above-mentioned measures and have achieved great results. More than 10,000 water conservancy maintenance technicians have been trained throughout the province, more than 4,000 water conservancy management organizations have been established, and special personnel have been assigned to manage the completed projects, and systems and plans for water management, water protection, and water use have been universally formulated. Nankang County has formulated a management method of "three checks" (regular inspections, inspections after rain, inspections after water use) and "three preventions" (preventing mountain torrents, preventing accidents, preventing water leakage), and implemented a system of graded management and maintenance of water conservancy projects throughout the county: large-scale projects benefiting more than 10,000 mu and several communes are under the unified leadership of the county, and the relevant communes are organized to jointly establish a management and maintenance committee, and special personnel are designated for management and water release; projects benefiting within one commune are organized by the commune to form a management and maintenance committee, and a secretary in charge of agriculture is designated to be responsible; general small-scale projects are responsible by the production team and handed over to commune members for management and maintenance. This fully mobilizes the enthusiasm of organizations at all levels and the broad masses of commune members in the county for water conservancy management and maintenance, so that the benefits of the more than 1,000 newly built water conservancy projects in the county this year have been greatly improved. In several communes of Linchuan County, through extensive debates, the commune members have established an atmosphere of taking pride in "storing water, protecting water, managing water, and cherishing water," and also held forums with old farmers; after "three checks" (checking projects, checking water sources, checking terrain) and "two calculations" (calculating water consumption, calculating water storage), they formulated a year-round water use plan and water use system to ensure that not a drop of water is wasted and no seedling is dried this year.
    Raising field ridges and using field areas to store water is a proven and effective experience in expanding the benefited area in many areas of Jiangxi in the past. This year, Jiangxi Province will continue to promote this experience, raising the field ridges of each mu of rice field by an average of one inch, storing 66.7 cubic meters of water. In this way, 36 million mu of rice fields throughout the province can store a total of 2.4 billion cubic meters of water, which is equivalent to increasing the irrigation area by 3 million mu. According to the summary of various communes in the Fuzhou Special District, raising field ridges to store water has four benefits: it can store water to resist drought; it can reduce mountain flood disasters; high ridges and full water can raise fish; and it can retain fertilizer. Therefore, this year, the field ridges in all rice fields in the district have been raised by more than one inch. In order to catch up with the spring rain season to store water, Jiangkou Commune in Gan County organized more than 3,000 commune members to launch a blitz before the arrival of the spring rain season, raising the field ridges of rice fields throughout the commune by two inches, and now all of them have been filled with water. At present, farmers throughout the province are combining spring plowing to build new field ridges, and have increased and consolidated the field ridges of more than 30 million mu of rice fields, with an average increase of one inch, and have blocked leaky holes and leaky seams.
    Another measure taken by Jiangxi Province this year to expand the benefited area is to vigorously use small rivers and mountain streams to build dams for water storage, and use pits, mountain gullies, and water canals for water storage. All places where water can be stored, such as small ponds, small dams, and small ponds, are filled with water. According to the experience of various places, implementing this measure is very simple, but the effect is great. As long as the terrain is suitable, it can be stored with a little processing and rectification. If 800 cubic meters of water is stored beside each mu of farmland, general drought disasters can be avoided. In the spring of last year, Hugou Commune in Xingzi County spent only more than 30 working days to renovate more than 50 mountain pits, mountain gullies, and small ponds, storing more than 5,000 cubic meters of water. As a result, more than 100 mu of rice fields achieved a bumper harvest even without rain for more than 80 days. This year, the commune has vigorously promoted this method, and so far, it has renovated more than 1,000 mountain gullies, small ponds, mountain pits, small dams, and mountain canals, and filled them with water. According to preliminary statistics as of now, the province has renovated 100,000 small-scale water conservancy projects of various kinds such as small mountain gullies, ponds, pits, and dams, with a water storage capacity of more than 100 million cubic meters.　　(Liu Guanghui)

　　江西充分发挥水的作用
　　边修建、边验收、边蓄水，使新修工程马上见效；
　　加强护养管理，力求合理用水，提高水的利用率；
　　利用田间、山溪、山沟、小塘蓄水扩大灌溉面积。
    本报南昌13日电　怎样使新修的水利工程马上见效？怎样充分扩大灌溉面积和提高水的利用率？江西省总结和吸取往年的经验，采取了三种办法：一、边修建、边验收、边蓄水、边受益；二、计划用水；三、利用田埂、土坑、山沟等等蓄水。采取了这些措施，不仅使新修的工程座座马上见效，还扩大了五百万亩受益面积，同时还使三百二十万亩田的水利工程提高了五十天的抗旱能力。
    江西省去冬今春共完成土石方四亿六千万公方，建成各种水利工程九万二千多处，共可扩大灌溉面积五百三十万亩，改善灌溉面积七百五十万亩。至此，加上过去已有的水利设施，全省四千四百万亩耕地面积中已有四千二百二十万亩可以灌溉，只有一百八十万亩还没有水利设施。为了确保今年农业大丰收，全省各地通过总结过去水利工作的经验和吸取老农的经验，从使新修工程马上见效和扩大受益面积两方面采取措施，弥补了一百八十万亩没有水利设施的不足。
    使新修工程马上见效的办法是边完工、边验收、边蓄水、边受益。往年一般是工程全部修成后才能蓄水、见效，往往因为动工迟，插秧后完工，错过了春雨蓄水季节，蓄不了水或蓄不满水，致使当年发挥效益很小或者不能发挥效益。据统计，前冬去春兴修的工程就有15％因此没有见效或者见效很小。为了改变这种情况，江西各地去冬兴修水利提前动工之后，采取了这样的办法：对分期完工的大型工程，尽先修好内坡，后修外坡，争取提前蓄水；对中型工程，修成一部分、验收一部分、蓄水一部分，到全部建成时也就全部验收完毕并蓄满了水；对小型工程，修成一处、验收一处、蓄水一处。这样做的结果，目前全省已完工的九万多处工程，都已蓄满了水，并且马上在春耕中发挥了效益。崇仁县今年由于采用了上述办法，新修的六百八十五处工程现在达到了塘满、库满、池满，座座工程蓄满水，在春耕中在雨水少的情况下有水灌溉，使早稻田都能及时溶田犁耙。
    加强护养管理和科学用水，是江西省提高水的利用率和扩大受益面积的一项重要措施。根据计算，这项措施执行之后，全省各工程的用水率可以提高5％，即增加二百万亩的灌溉面积。这项措施是：一、加强思想教育，在广大社员中树立“蓄水、保水、管水、惜水”的思想和风气；二、层层建立管理机构，座座工程指定专人管理，制定护养制度，做到勤检查、勤修理；三、吸取老农的经验，实行浅灌、勤灌、轮灌，防止漫灌、满灌等浪费水的现象；四、实行“四分四定”用水的方法，即分工程定田、分田定水、分灌区定人管理、分作物定水量，做到用水有计划，保证丘丘田灌水不间断；五、合理用水节约用水，就近放水、看水源放水，低水放低田、高水放高田，先放低塘水、后放高塘水，先用活水、后用死水，先灌黄苗、后灌青苗，先救早、后救晚，做到用水适量、适时，既满足了作物需要，又节约了用水量；六、整理渠系，做到库塘相连、库坝相通，河渠相连、库渠相通，长藤结瓜，节节蓄水，统一灌溉，以便调剂水源和均衡水势；七、添置和改进排灌工具，大力推广风力、水力水车，提高提水效率；八、建立管养人员和放水人员的责任制度和奖励制度，以加强和鼓舞他们的责任心和积极性。
    目前江西全省各地都正在贯彻执行上述措施，已有很大成绩。全省已训练了一万多名水利护养技术人员，共成立了四千多个水利管养机构，已完工的工程都指定了专人管理，普遍制定了管水、保水、用水的制度和计划。南康县制定了“三查”（平时定期检查、雨后检查、用水后检查）、“三防”（防山洪暴发、防事故、防漏水）的管理办法，实行了分级管养全县水利工程的制度：灌溉万亩以上、几个公社受益的大型工程由县统一领导，组织有关公社共同成立管养委员会，指定专人管养、放水；在一个公社内受益的工程就由公社组织管养委员会，并指定一名管农业的书记负责；一般的小型工程由生产队负责，交给社员管养。这就充分发挥了全县各级组织和广大社员对水利管养工作的积极性，使全县今年新修的一千多处水利工程的效益大大提高。临川县若干公社通过大辩论，在社员中树立了以“蓄水、保水、管水、惜水”为荣的风气，又开了老农座谈会；经过“三查”（查工程、查水源、查地形）、“二算”（算用水量、算蓄水量），制定了全年用水计划和用水制度，保证今年不浪费一滴水、不旱死一棵禾。
    加高田埂，利用田间蓄水，是江西许多地区过去行之有效的扩大受益面积的经验。今年江西全省将继续推行这一经验，平均每亩稻田田埂加高一公寸，蓄水六十六点七公方。这样，全省三千六百万亩稻田共可以蓄水二十四亿公方，等于增加了三百万亩灌溉面积。据抚州专区各公社总结，加高田埂蓄水有四个好处：能蓄水抗旱；能减轻山洪灾害；埂高水满能养鱼；能保肥料。因此今年全区稻田田埂都加高了一公寸以上。为了赶上春雨季节蓄水，赣县江口公社组织三千多名社员，在春雨季节到来前突击，将全社稻田田埂加高了二公寸，现在已全部蓄满了水。目前全省农民结合春耕做新田埂，已对三千多万亩稻田田埂进行了加高、加固，一般田埂增高了一公寸，并堵塞了漏水洞和漏水缝。
    江西省今年采取的扩大受益面积的另一项措施是，大力利用小河山溪拦坝蓄水，利用土坑、山沟、水圳蓄水，凡是可以蓄水的小池、小坝、小塘等地方到处都蓄满水。根据各地经验，执行这一措施非常简便，收效却很大。只要地形适宜，就便稍一加工整修便可以蓄水。每亩田旁如果就便蓄八百公方水，就能避免一般干旱灾害。星子县虎口公社去年春季只花三十多个劳动日便整修了五十多个山坑、山沟、小池，蓄了五千多公方水，结果使一百多亩稻田在八十多天没有下雨的情况下也获得了大丰收。今年这个公社大力推行了这项办法，至今已整修了山沟、小池、山坑、小水坝、山圳一千多处，并蓄满了水。截至目前的初步统计，全省已整修的小山沟、池、坑、坝等各种小小型水利工程已达十万处，蓄水量在一亿公方以上。　　（刘光辉）
