Distribution According to Work and Exchange of Equal Value
Fang Yuan

“From each according to his ability, to each according to his work,” is the fundamental principle of socialist society for the distribution of consumer goods to individuals, and it is also the fundamental principle for the distribution of consumer goods to individuals in our country today. For a considerable period of time to come, the people's communes in our country will still be socialist in nature. The people's communes now implement a system combining wages and supply, in which the supply system contains elements of distribution according to need; however, the basic principle for the distribution of consumer goods to commune members is still distribution according to work.

Production determines distribution, and distribution in turn affects production. Good distribution will promote the development of production; poor distribution will hinder the development of production. Therefore, the issue of distribution is an important aspect of the national economic life, and also an important aspect of consolidating and developing the people's commune system.

The total social product of a socialist society, after deducting the portion used to compensate for the means of production consumed in production, is partly controlled by society and partly distributed to individuals. The portion controlled by society is used as expenses for expanded reproduction, reserves for disaster prevention, administrative expenses, cultural, educational, and welfare expenses, and social insurance expenses. For the people's communes, the proportion of these expenses deducted from the total income should be determined according to the economic possibilities and needs of each commune. Deducting too little is not conducive to the consolidation and development of the commune; deducting too much makes the portion distributed to the commune members too small, which is not conducive to further promoting the labor enthusiasm of the commune members, and is also not conducive to the consolidation and development of the commune. We must never distribute all the fruits of labor to individuals and consume them all; we must make various deductions (including the compensation for consumed means of production). These deductions are directly or indirectly used to meet the various needs of the laborers, especially for the continuous expansion of socialist reproduction. This is the material foundation for consolidating and developing the common and long-term interests of the working people, and is therefore indispensable.

After making the above deductions, the remaining products are distributed to individual laborers according to the basic principle of distribution according to work. The principle of distribution according to work requires that consumer goods be distributed according to the labor contributed by the laborers, more work more gain, less work less gain, that is, the amount of consumer goods that the laborers receive should be consistent with the amount of labor they contribute (after all necessary deductions). When Marx explained this point in "Critique of the Gotha Program," he pointed out: "Each individual producer receives back from society, after the deductions have been made, exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. ... He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such and such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common fund), and with this certificate he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as costs the same amount of labor. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another form. Here obviously the same principle prevails as that which regulates commodity exchange, as far as this is exchange of equal values."

Under the socialist system, adhering to the basic principle of exchange of equal value in the distribution issue is an important aspect of correctly handling the internal relations of the working people. The entire social product is produced by all the laborers, but the labor contributed by each laborer is unequal in quantity and quality; some contribute more, some contribute less, some are of good quality, and some are of poor quality. At the current stage of our country, the social products are not yet rich enough to fully meet the various needs of all members; the communist ideological awareness and moral qualities of the entire people have yet to be greatly improved; universal education needs to be popularized and improved; differences still exist between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and manual labor; for laborers at present, labor is, as Marx pointed out, not yet the prime want in life, but only a means to life. In this case, if the principle of distribution according to work is not implemented in the distribution of consumer goods, and the principle of exchange of equal value is not implemented, and attempts are made to forcibly equalize the differences between various laborers, various production teams, and even various communes by means of unequal exchange, thus resulting in the situation where some laborers occupy the labor results of other laborers without compensation, this is detrimental to the unity of the working people, to the full mobilization of the enthusiasm of all the working people, to the rapid development of the national economy, and to the development and consolidation of the people's communes.

In the socialist stage, the principle of exchange of equal value exists not only in the distribution of consumer goods, but also in other aspects of economic life. For example, in production, labor cooperation between the various production teams of the people's communes and between the commune factories and agricultural production teams must implement the principle of exchange of equal value. Last year's communist cooperation among the working people played a great role in the great leap forward in production and the economic construction of the entire country, and their labor results will have a profound impact on the future development of production and the improvement of people's lives. It is certainly wrong to deny this great achievement. In the future, we must continue to promote mutual cooperation, and it is still necessary to appropriately carry out certain obligatory labor according to needs. However, in general, if the exchange of equal value is not implemented, or if too much obligatory labor is organized unilaterally, the result will inevitably cause economic losses to some units and laborers, and cannot be sustained in the long run. For another example, in exchange, when exchanging products and materials between various communes, between various production teams within the commune, and between the commune and the production teams, the basic principle of exchange of equal value must also be implemented, and products and materials should not be transferred without compensation.

Socialism is not egalitarianism, and communism is not egalitarianism either. The socialist principle of distribution is "From each according to his ability, to each according to his work," and the communist principle of distribution is "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need." These principles are fundamentally different from egalitarianism. Marxist classic writers, our Party Central Committee, and Comrade Mao Zedong have long criticized the error of this egalitarianism. In history, laborers have had many egalitarian illusions, and have tried egalitarianism in slave uprisings and peasant wars. This is a reflection of the immaturity of the labor's movement to liberate themselves, and in fact they have not achieved, nor could they achieve, the expected results. We must oppose egalitarianism, and adhere to the basic principles of distribution according to work and exchange of equal value in the socialist stage. Because only in this way can it be conducive to the unity of the working people and the promotion of labor enthusiasm, and can it be conducive to the consolidation of the people's communes and the development of socialist production.

    按劳分配和等价交换
    方元
    “各尽所能，按劳分配”，这是社会主义社会对个人分配消费品的基本原则，也是我国今天对个人分配消费品的基本原则。我国的人民公社，在相当长的一段时间以内，仍将是社会主义性质的。人民公社现在实行工资制和供给制相结合的制度，其中供给制的部分包含着按需分配的因素；但是，对社员分配消费品的基本原则，还是按劳分配。
    生产决定分配，分配又会反过来对生产发生影响。分配得好，就会促进生产的发展；分配得不好，则会妨碍生产的发展。因此，分配问题，是国民经济生活中的一个重要方面，也是巩固和发展人民公社制度的一个重要方面。
    社会主义社会的社会总产品，除去用以补偿在生产中消耗掉的生产资料的部分以外，其余的，一部分归社会掌握，一部分分配给个人。由社会掌握的部分，是用来作为扩大再生产所需的费用、预防灾害所需的储备、行政管理费用、文化教育和福利事业费用、社会保险费用等。对人民公社来说，这些费用的扣除，在总收入中占多大的比例，应当按照各公社在经济上的可能和需要来确定。扣除过少，不利于公社的巩固和发展；扣除过多，使分配给社员的部分过少，不利于进一步发扬社员的劳动积极性，同样也不利于公社的巩固和发展。我们决不能把劳动的成果全部分配给个人，全部消费掉，而必须作各项扣除（包括已消耗的生产资料的补偿费用在内）。这些扣除都是直接或间接地用于满足劳动者的各种需要，特别是用于不断扩大社会主义社会的再生产。这是巩固和发展劳动人民的共同利益和长远利益的物质基础，因而是决不可少的。
    作了以上各项扣除之后，剩下的产品，根据按劳分配的基本原则，分配给劳动者个人。按劳分配的原则，要求按照劳动者付出的劳动来分配消费品，多劳多得，少劳少得，即要求劳动者分得消费品的多少同他付出的劳动量（经过各项必要的扣除以后）相符合。马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中说明这一点时，曾指出：“每一个别的生产者，在作了各项扣除之后，从社会中正好领回他所给予社会的一切。他所给予社会的，就是他个人的劳动股份。……他从社会方面领得一张收据，证明他供给了多少劳动（扣除他为社会基金而进行的劳动），而他凭这张收据又从社会储备中领得与其劳动量相等的那么多的消费品。他以一种形态给予社会的劳动量，又以另一种形态全部取回来。显然，这里通行的就是那个调节商品交换的原则，因为商品交换是同等价值的交换。”
    在社会主义制度下，在分配问题上坚持等价交换的基本原则，是正确处理劳动人民内部关系的一个重要方面。社会的全部产品是由全体劳动者生产出来的，但每个劳动者付出的劳动，在数量和质量上，是不相等的，有的付出得多，有的付出得少，有的质量好，有的质量差。而我国目前阶段，社会的产品还没有丰富到足以充分满足全体成员的各种需要；全体人民的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质还有待于大大提高，全民教育有待于普及和提高；工农之间、城乡之间、脑力劳动和体力劳动之间还存在着差别；劳动这件事，现时对劳动者来说，正如马克思所指出的，还不是乐生的第一要素，主要的还是谋生的手段。在这种情况下，如果在消费品的分配问题上不执行按劳分配的原则，不执行等价交换的原则，企图用不等价交换的办法勉强拉平在各个劳动者间、各个生产队间、乃至各个公社间的差别，因而发生一部分劳动者无偿占有另一部分劳动者的劳动成果的情况，这对于劳动人民内部的团结，对于充分发挥全体劳动人民的积极性，对于国民经济的迅速发展，以及对于人民公社的发展和巩固，都是不利的。
    在社会主义阶段，等价交换的原则不仅存在于消费品的分配关系中，同样也存在于经济生活的其他方面。例如，在生产方面，在人民公社各生产队之间、公社工厂同农业生产队之间进行的劳动协作，就必须贯彻执行等价交换的原则。去年劳动人民中间的共产主义大协作，对生产大跃进和整个国家经济建设事业起了伟大的作用，他们的劳动结果，将对今后生产的发展和人民生活的改善发生深远的影响。否认这个伟大的成就当然是不对的。在今后，必须继续提倡相互协作，而按照需要适当地进行某些义务劳动也仍然是必要的。但是，在一般的情况下，如果不实行等价交换或者片面地过多地组织义务劳动，结果就势必使一些单位和劳动者受到经济上的损失，而不能长期坚持下去。又例如，在交换方面，在各个公社之间，在公社内部各个生产队之间，在公社同生产队之间进行产品和物资的交换的时候，也必须贯彻执行等价交换的基本原则，而不应当对于产品和物资实行无偿调拨。
    社会主义不是平均主义，共产主义也不是平均主义。社会主义的分配原则是“各尽所能，按劳分配”，共产主义的分配原则是“各尽所能，按需分配”。这些原则和平均主义是根本不同的。马克思主义经典作家、我们党中央和毛泽东同志早就批判过这种平均主义的错误。历史上劳动者有过许多平均主义的幻想，在奴隶暴动和农民战争中都曾试行过平均主义，这是劳动者解放自己的运动还不成熟的反映，实际上他们都没有达到、也不可能达到预期的结果。我们必须反对平均主义，在社会主义阶段坚持按劳分配、等价交换的基本原则。因为只有这样，才有利于劳动人民的团结和劳动积极性的发扬，才有利于人民公社的巩固和社会主义生产的发展。
