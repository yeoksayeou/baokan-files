    Mass Production of Indanthrene
    China's first Indanthrene dye production system—the two Indanthrene workshops of the Jilin Dyestuff Factory—have been put into production.
    Indanthrene is a high-grade dye widely favored by the Chinese people, which in the past mainly relied on imports. The two workshops of the Jilin Dyestuff Factory have a large production capacity. The annual output of Indanthrene Blue alone can supply half of the country's population with enough dye for one set of clothes per person per year.

    大量生产阴丹士林
    我国第一个阴丹士林染料生产系统——吉林染料厂的两个阴丹士林车间，已经投入生产。
    阴丹士林是我国人民普遍喜爱的一种高级染料，过去主要依靠进口。吉林染料厂这两个车间生产能力很大，仅阴丹士林蓝的年产量，就可以供全国半数人口每人每年染一套衣服。
