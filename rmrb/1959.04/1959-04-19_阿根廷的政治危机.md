　　The Political Crisis in Argentina
　　Zhang Ye
    Recently, Argentina has been experiencing a profound political crisis due to the increasingly right-leaning and regressive policies of the Frondizi government and its repeated compromises and concessions to U.S. imperialism. This is mainly manifested in: an unstable and turbulent political situation, successive waves of strikes, and the growing patriotic struggle to fight for democratic freedoms, prevent the restoration of dictatorial rule, and defend national sovereignty.
    Economic Policies That Betray National Interests
    The political crisis in Argentina is primarily caused by the Frondizi government's implementation of reactionary economic policies that benefit U.S. monopoly capital while harming national and popular interests. As we know, although Argentina is the second largest country in Latin America, with abundant underground resources and land and climate highly suitable for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, its economy has consistently been in a difficult state. In his inaugural address on May 1, 1958, Frondizi pointed out that Argentina's economy was "in a state of crisis." The economic situation at the time was: Argentina's foreign trade deficit was estimated to reach $360 million; its gold and foreign exchange reserves were only $370 million, while its foreign debt amounted to $3 billion. The national budget for 1958-1959 was more than 80 billion pesos, but revenue only accounted for 48% of expenditure. U.S. imperialism and Argentine reactionaries took advantage of these economic difficulties to constantly put pressure on the Frondizi government, forcing it to abandon the program it had put forward during the election, which was more in line with the current aspirations of the Argentine people and national interests. (The main content of this program was: defending national resources; developing heavy industry, especially the metallurgical industry; lowering land prices, prohibiting landlords from seizing tenants' land, and providing loans and technical assistance to farmers; guaranteeing freedom and unity of trade unions; expanding foreign trade; opposing military blocs and implementing a policy of peaceful coexistence), instead implementing policies of compromise and surrender to domestic and foreign reactionaries.
    Faced with serious economic difficulties and the combined offensive of domestic and foreign reactionaries, Frondizi did not rely closely on the working class and all the people who supported his election, did not insist on implementing the election program that was supported by the people, and did not first rely on domestic capital, that is, mainly rely on increasing taxes on huge profits, reducing military spending, and expanding foreign trade to develop the economy. Instead, he succumbed to the reactionary forces and adopted a series of measures that harmed the Argentine people and national interests.
    The first measure taken by the Frondizi government to compromise and surrender to domestic and foreign reactionaries was to rely on foreign capital, mainly U.S. capital, to solve Argentina's problem of self-sufficiency in oil. On July 24, 1958, Frondizi issued a statement announcing that the Argentine government had reached an agreement with a series of foreign oil companies on concluding contracts for the joint exploitation of Argentine oil. The total amount of investment provided by these companies to Argentina was $1 billion, of which the "American Group," led by Atlas Corporation, would provide $790 million. Frondizi government's measure of transferring oil concession rights to U.S. monopoly capital under the clever guise of "joint exploitation" aroused huge protests from the Argentine people, and a wave of strikes swept the country, to the extent that the Argentine government had to shelve the plan. However, later, on December 4, 1958, the Argentine state oil organization, the Petroleum Deposits Administration, signed contracts with U.S. New Jersey Standard Oil and British-Dutch Shell Oil Company, granting these two companies new oil exploitation rights, allowing foreign monopoly capital to control the Argentine oil resources they had long coveted. According to the contract, Argentina granted New Jersey Standard Oil exploration rights to 2,000 square miles of land at the foot of the Andes Mountains in Neuquén Province and exploration rights to the area south of the oilfields already being exploited by the Petroleum Deposits Administration, while granting British-Dutch Shell Oil exploration, development and production rights to 115,000 square miles of land including Río Negro. As a statement issued by the "Defend Argentine Oil Movement" organization pointed out, the oil contracts signed by the Argentine government with foreign companies were "another step in the government's policy of surrender and ceding sovereignty."
    The Frondizi government's activities of siding with U.S. imperialism did not stop there. At the end of December 1958, in order to obtain $329 million in loans from the "International Monetary Fund" and U.S. banks, the Frondizi government even accepted the enslaving conditions put forward by the "International Monetary Fund," which in practice allowed the U.S. to interfere in Argentina's internal affairs, and implemented a so-called "economic stabilization plan" domestically. These conditions were: abolishing the free exchange rate between the peso and the dollar, drastically reducing government employees, freezing workers' wages, restricting the right to strike, lifting restrictions on the import of U.S. goods, increasing taxes domestically, no longer providing any subsidies to state-owned enterprises, reducing trade with socialist countries, and creating a "favorable climate" for foreign investment, etc.
    After the implementation of this plan by the Frondizi government, which was called "economy and sacrifice," Argentina's economic situation further deteriorated. Due to the implementation of a new free exchange rate, the exchange rate between the peso and the dollar fell from eighteen to one to sixty-five to sixty-eight to one, and the prices of food, consumer goods, and public utility fees in Argentina rose sharply, with the prices of many commodities even rising two to three times. U.S. monopoly capital, importers and exporters, as well as Argentine landlords, bankers, usurers, and comprador classes, profited greatly from this.
    Therefore, this unpopular measure of the Frondizi government aroused strong dissatisfaction among all strata of the Argentine people. All opposition parties in Argentina, and even some people in the ruling Intransigent Radical Civic Union, opposed this plan. The Argentine General Confederation of Labor, uniting sixty-two trade unions, accused the plan of being "imposed by foreign monopoly capital providing enslaving loans to Argentina." The General Secretary of the Argentine Communist Party, Codovilla, pointed out in a report that "this is a plunder plan against the working masses that no previous government has dared to implement." Intransigent Radical Civic Union Congressman González also admitted in a speech in the House of Representatives that the government's policy was "tragic and unpopular." As for the broad masses of the Argentine people, they are launching a nationwide fierce struggle around the opposition to the price increases caused by the "economic stabilization plan." On January 18, the day Frondizi left for the United States, more than 10,000 people protested in demonstrations and a large-scale national general strike broke out. Members of three different trade union systems participated in this strike, which was a rare unified action.
    In order to create a "favorable climate" for foreign investment, the Frondizi government also returned the originally nationalized German and French enterprises to their owners, granted the electricity trust Argentine Electric Power Company concession rights, handed over state-run slaughterhouses to private individuals, and, in order to seek more U.S. private investment, Frondizi personally visited the United States and assured U.S. monopoly capital that the Argentine government would provide "preferential conditions" for foreign investment and "give the strictest respect" to foreign property.
    The Frondizi government's implementation of economic policies that yield to U.S. monopoly capital and harm its own national interests has already caused serious deterioration of the national financial economy, increasing poverty of the people, massive penetration of imperialist monopoly capital, and extreme instability of the political situation.
    A Series of Reactionary Measures
    Since the Frondizi government surrendered to the offensive of domestic and foreign reactionary forces and abandoned its election program, it was bound to embark on a path of anti-people and suppression of democratic freedoms in politics. The state of emergency declared on November 11, 1958, to suppress the oil workers' strike has not been lifted to this day, constitutional guarantees have been suspended indefinitely, and several national arrests have been carried out, with prisons full of trade union leaders and communists; military mobilization has been used to suppress the strike movement, forcing workers to return to work, and nearly 500,000 workers have been drafted into the army; all reactionary anti-communist tactics commonly used by reactionaries have been adopted to attack the people's movement, and the Communist Party headquarters, local party offices, and party newspapers have been closed down.
    These actions of the Frondizi government have received the support and applause of domestic and foreign reactionaries, but have aroused dissatisfaction and opposition from the broad masses of the people. "New York Times" reporter Juan de Onis wrote in a dispatch that Frondizi's prestige had fallen to its lowest point since he took office last May, but he was praised by the "hated oligarchy" that he accused of being responsible for the "national ills." His standing in the eyes of Washington officials and U.S. capitalists has also been fully restored. This is the inevitable result of the Frondizi government's rightward regression. The Argentine Communist Party condemned in a statement that the Frondizi government was preparing the way for dictatorial rule, and pointed out that this anti-democratic policy fundamentally came from U.S. imperialists who have large investments in Argentina. In his report at the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party in January, the party's General Secretary Codovilla, when analyzing the domestic situation in Argentina, pointed out that the Frondizi government had completely abandoned the platform of February 23. The relationship between the government and feudal landlords, big capital, and imperialist monopoly capital has become so close that they are integrated into one.
    Why the Rightward Regression
    The Frondizi government came to power with the support of the broad masses of the people, and was the first constitutional government elected by the people in Argentina since 1930. Therefore, it had a high level of prestige among the masses at the beginning of its term. Why would such a government abandon its election promises and embark on a path resolutely opposed by the people?
    First, the Frondizi government's rightward regression is a direct result of pressure from domestic and foreign reactionary forces, especially U.S. imperialism. The United States has a large amount of investment in Argentina, and in order to ensure that it extracts super-profits from these investments and further controls and plunders Argentina, it has tried every means to obstruct Argentina from developing in the direction of democracy and national independence as proposed in the election program. They used various pressures, including economic "aid" and the bait of increased investment, to force the Frondizi government to submit to U.S. imperialism.
    Second, the national bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, which occupy a dominant position in the ruling Intransigent Radical Civic Union led by Frondizi, have greater vacillation and compromise. The program put forward by Frondizi in the election basically met the current demands of the Argentine people and received the support of different forces, but at the same time it also assumed obligations to all kinds of and hostile forces, including to Peronists, upper-level members of the church, the comprador class, reactionary military cliques, and even imperialist monopoly capital groups. There were also representatives of feudal forces and imperialist monopoly capital forces among the members of the Frondizi government. These forces were unwilling to see Argentina embark on the path of democracy and independence, so after Frondizi took office, they first used Argentina's economic difficulties and the obligations that Frondizi had undertaken in the election to constantly put pressure on the government. Due to the weakness of the Frondizi government itself, and its attempt to use the contradictions between various forces to maintain power to a certain extent, it could not but waver, compromise, and even surrender under the increasing pressure of domestic and foreign reactionary forces.
    Third, although Frondizi came to power with the support of the broad masses of the people, he did not continue to rely on the people to implement the election program and fight back against reactionary forces after he came to power. Frondizi's government is a joint regime dominated by the national bourgeoisie and joined by landlords and the comprador class, rather than a broad democratic coalition government, which has lost the strength to defeat domestic and foreign reactionary forces.
    Fourth, the situation of two regimes that has existed in Argentina since 1930—a regime elected through elections and a military group that actually possesses great power—has not changed. U.S. imperialism and Argentine reactionaries have always used military groups to exert control. After Frondizi came to power, not only did he not destroy the reactionary machinery in the army, police, and administrative organs, nor did he eliminate the coup plotters in the army, but instead attempted to use the factional opposition in the army as one of the elements to stabilize the government, so he could not but compromise in the face of the pressure of these reactionary military groups.
    Fifth, the people's movement in Argentina does not currently have sufficient power to overcome the pressure exerted by reactionary forces on the Frondizi government and force it to move forward along the path required by the people. This is mainly because, to date, Argentina has not yet built a strong anti-imperialist and anti-feudal national democratic united front, and the people's movement, especially the workers' movement, is still in a state of division. For example, there are three systems in the Argentine workers' movement, namely, the Sixty-Two Unions led by Peronists, the Thirty-Two Unions jointly led by yellow reformist leaders and the Regional Organization of Workers of the Americas and other U.S. trade union leaders, and the Nineteen Unions led by the Communist Party. The divided state of the workers' movement seriously affected the struggle against the Frondizi government, disrupting the pace of the strike movement and preventing it from exerting its due power. The Nineteen Unions have persevered in working to overcome this divided state and strengthen the unity and cooperation of the trade union movement, but have been resisted and opposed by the leaders of the Sixty-Two Unions, especially the Thirty-Two Unions.
    Naturally, these factors that are unfavorable to Argentina's democratic progress are not unchangeable. The key lies in the unity of the Argentine democratic forces, especially the workers' movement. Argentina's patriotic and democratic forces spare no effort to win over all progressive forces, especially the unity of the workers' movement, in order to strengthen their struggle. The possibility of the people's movement moving from division to unity exists. The general strike on January 18 and the fact that representatives of the Sixty-Two Unions and the Nineteen Unions jointly held a meeting in February to discuss the domestic situation and the program of struggle show this trend.

　　阿根廷的政治危机
　　章叶
    最近以来，由于弗朗迪西政府日益右倾倒退和对美帝国主义一再妥协让步，阿根廷正在经历着深刻的政治危机。这主要表现在：政治局势动荡不安，罢工浪潮此伏彼起，争取民主自由、防止独裁统治复辟和保卫国家主权的爱国斗争日益发展。
    出卖民族利益的经济政策
    阿根廷的政治危机，主要是由弗朗迪西政府执行有利于美国垄断资本而损害民族和人民利益的反动经济政策引起的。大家知道，阿根廷虽然是拉丁美洲第二大国，地下蕴藏着丰富的资源，土地和气候又极适合农牧业的发展，但是，它的经济却一直处于困难状态。弗朗迪西在1958年5月1日的就职演说中就指出，阿根廷的经济“正处在危机中”。当时的经济情况是：阿根廷的对外贸易逆差估计将达三亿六千万美元；黄金外汇储备只有三亿七千万美元，外债却欠了三十亿美元。而1958—1959年度的国家预算是八百多亿比索，但收入却仅为支出的48％。美帝国主义和阿根廷反动派就利用经济困难，不断向弗朗迪西政府施加压力，迫使它放弃竞选时提出的比较符合当前阿根廷人民愿望和民族利益的纲领（这项纲领的主要内容是：保卫国家资源；发展重工业，特别是冶金工业；降低土地售价，禁止地主夺佃，给农民贷款和技术援助；保证工会自由和统一；扩大对外贸易；反对军事集团，实行和平共处的政策），执行向国内外反动派妥协投降的政策。
    在严重的经济困难和国内外反动派联合进攻的面前，弗朗迪西不是紧紧地依靠支持他当选的工人阶级和全体人民，坚持执行为人民所拥护的竞选纲领，首先依靠本国资本，即主要依靠增加对巨额利润的税收、裁减军费和扩大对外贸易的办法来发展经济，而是向反动势力屈服，采取了一系列损害阿根廷人民和民族利益的措施。
    弗朗迪西政府对国内外反动派妥协投降的第一个措施，是依靠外国资本，主要是美国资本来解决阿根廷的石油自给自足问题。1958年7月24日，弗朗迪西发表文告宣布，阿根廷政府已经同一系列外国石油公司就缔结共同开采阿根廷石油的合同达成协议。这些公司为阿根廷提供的投资总额为十亿美元，其中以阿特拉斯公司为首的“美国集团”将提供七亿九千万美元的投资。弗朗迪西政府在“共同开采”的巧妙伪装下出让石油租让权给美国垄断资本的措施，激起了阿根廷人民的巨大抗议运动，罢工浪潮席卷全国，以致阿根廷政府不得不搁置这项计划。但是，后来，在1958年12月4日，阿根廷国家石油组织——石油矿藏管理局又同美国新泽西美孚油公司和英国的英荷壳牌石油公司分别签订了给予这两家公司以新的石油开采权的合同，使得外国垄断资本得以控制它们垂涎已久的阿根廷石油资源。根据合同，阿根廷把内乌康省安第斯山麓的两千平方英里地区的勘探权和已经在开采中的石油矿藏管理局油田以南地区的勘探权给予新泽西美孚油公司，而把包括里奥内格罗的十一万五千平方英里地区的石油勘探、开发和生产权让与英荷壳牌石油公司。正像“保卫阿根廷石油运动”组织发表的一项声明所指出的，阿根廷政府同外国公司签订的石油合同是“政府的投降和出让主权政策的又一步骤”。
    弗朗迪西政府投靠美帝国主义的活动，并没有到此为止。1958年12月底，为了取得“国际货币基金组织”和美国银行的三亿二千九百万美元的贷款，弗朗迪西政府竟接受了“国际货币基金组织”提出的实际上允许美国干涉阿根廷内政的奴役性条件，在国内实行所谓“稳定经济计划”。这些条件是：取消比索和美元的自由兑换率，大量裁减政府职员，冻结职工工资，限制罢工权利，取消对美国商品进口的限制，对内增加赋税，不再给国营企业以任何补贴，缩减对社会主义国家的贸易以及为外国投资造成“有利的气候”等等。
    弗朗迪西政府这一名之为“节约与牺牲”的计划实施以后，阿根廷的经济情况进一步恶化。由于实行新的自由汇兑牌价，比索和美元的兑换率从十八比一降到六十五—六十八比一，阿根廷的食品、消费品的价格和公用事业使用费都急剧上涨，许多商品的价格竟上涨了两倍到三倍。而美国垄断资本和进出口商以及阿根廷大地主、银行家、高利贷者和买办阶级却从中获得巨大利润。
    因此，弗朗迪西政府的这一不得人心的措施，激起阿根廷各阶层人民的强烈不满。阿根廷所有的反对党，甚至执政的不妥协激进公民联盟中的一些人士都反对这个计划。联合着六十二个工会的阿根廷工会联合会指责这项计划是“向阿根廷提供奴役性贷款的外国垄断资本所强加的”。阿根廷共产党总书记柯都维亚在一次报告中指出，“这是历届政府从来未敢实行的对劳动群众的掠夺计划”。不妥协激进公民联盟议员冈萨雷斯在众议院的演说中也承认，政府的政策是“悲剧性的，不得人心的”。至于阿根廷广大人民则正围绕着反对由“稳定经济计划”引起的物价上涨展开了全国性的激烈斗争。1月18日弗朗迪西动身访美的那一天，爆发了一万多人的抗议示威和巨大规模的全国总罢工。参加这次罢工的有三个不同系统的工会会员，这是历次罢工中少有的一致行动。
    为了给外国投资制造“有利的气候”，弗朗迪西政府还把已经国有化的原德国和法国的企业交还给它们的主人，给电业托辣斯阿根廷电力公司以租让权，把国营屠宰场交给私人以及为寻求更多的美国私人投资，弗朗迪西亲自访问美国，并向美国垄断资本提出保证，阿根廷政府将为外国投资提供“优惠的条件”和对外国财产“给予最严格的尊重”。
    弗朗迪西政府执行屈从美国垄断资本、损害本国民族利益的经济政策，已经引起了国家财政经济严重恶化，人民生活日益贫困，帝国主义垄断资本大量渗入和政治局势极端不稳的恶果。
    一系列的反动措施
    弗朗迪西政府既然在国内外反动势力的进攻下屈服投降，背弃竞选纲领，在政治上就必然走上反人民和压制民主自由的道路。1958年11月11日为镇压石油工人罢工而宣布的紧急戒严状态，直到现在还没有解除，宪法保障无限期地停止执行，还进行几次全国性的逮捕，监狱里关满了工会领袖和共产党人；用军事动员的手段镇压罢工运动，强迫工人复工，目前几乎有五十万工人被征召入伍；采用一切反动派所惯用的反共手法来进攻人民运动，并且封闭共产党总部、党的地方办事处和党报。
    弗朗迪西政府的这些做法，得到了国内外反动派的支持和喝采，但是引起了广大人民的不满和反对。“纽约时报”记者胡安·戴昂尼斯在一篇通讯中写道，弗朗迪西的声望已经降低到自从他去年5月执政以来的最低点，但是他却受到了他指责应对“国家弊端”负责的那个“讨厌的寡头”的赞扬。他在华盛顿官员和美国资本家眼中的地位也完全恢复了。这是弗朗迪西政府右倾倒退的必然结果。阿根廷共产党在一项声明中谴责弗朗迪西政府正为独裁统治准备道路，并指出这种反民主政策根本上来自在阿根廷拥有大量投资的美帝国主义者。党的总书记柯都维亚在阿共中央一月扩大会议上的报告中分析阿根廷国内局势时指出，弗朗迪西政府已经完全抛弃了2月23日的纲领。政府和封建地主、大资本以及帝国主义垄断资本之间的关系已经密切到合为一体的地步了。
    为什么会右倾倒退
    弗朗迪西政府是曾经得到广大人民的支持而上台的，并且是阿根廷1930年以来第一次由人民选出的宪法政府，因此，在执政之初，在人民群众中有较高的威信。为什么这样一个政府会背弃竞选诺言，走上为人民所坚决反对的道路上去呢？
    第一，弗朗迪西政府的右倾倒退是国内外反动派，特别是美帝国主义施加压力的直接结果。美国在阿根廷拥有大量的投资，为了保证从这些投资中榨取超额利润和进一步控制和掠夺阿根廷，就千方百计地阻挠阿根廷沿着竞选纲领中所提出的民主和民族独立的方向发展。他们使用了各种压力，包括经济“援助”和增加投资的诱饵，迫使弗朗迪西政府屈从美帝国主义。
    第二，在弗朗迪西领导的执政党不妥协激进公民联盟中占优势的民族资产阶级和小资产阶级，具有较大的动摇性和妥协性。弗朗迪西在竞选中提出的纲领，基本上符合阿根廷人民目前的要求，并得到了不同力量的支持，但同时却也对各种各样的和敌对的势力承担了义务，其中包括对庇隆分子、教会上层分子、买办阶级、反动军人集团以至帝国主义垄断资本集团承担了义务。弗朗迪西政府的成员，也还有封建势力和帝国主义垄断资本势力的代表。这些势力是不愿意阿根廷走上民主和独立的道路的，因而在弗朗迪西执政后，首先利用阿根廷的经济困难和弗朗迪西在竞选中曾经承担的义务，不断向这个政府施加压力。由于弗朗迪西政府本身力量的软弱，它又在一定程度上企图利用各种势力的相互矛盾来维持政权，它就不能不在国内外反动势力的日益加深的压力下动摇、妥协以至于投降。
    第三，弗朗迪西虽然是得到广大人民的支持而上台的，但是，在他上台后并没有继续依靠人民来贯彻执行竞选纲领和反击反动势力。弗朗迪西的政府是一个以民族资产阶级为主，有地主和买办阶级参加的联合政权，而不是一个广泛的民主联合政府，这就失去了战胜国内外反动势力的力量。
    第四，从1930年以来阿根廷一直存在的两个政权——经过选举产生的政权和实际上拥有很大势力的军人集团的局面，并没有改变。美帝国主义和阿根廷反动派一向通过军人集团来进行控制。弗朗迪西上台后，不但没有摧毁军队、警察和行政机关中的反动机器，没有清除军队中的政变分子，反而企图利用军队中的派系对立，作为稳定政府的要素之一，这就不能不在这些反动军人集团的压力面前妥协让步。
    第五，目前阿根廷的人民运动还没有足够的力量战胜反动势力对弗朗迪西政府施加的压力，而迫使它沿着人民所要求的道路前进。这主要是由于到目前为止，阿根廷还没有建成一个强大的反帝反封建的民族民主阵线，人民运动，特别是工人运动还处于分裂的状态。例如，阿根廷的工人运动存在着三个系统，即庇隆分子领导的六十二工会，黄色的改良派领袖和美洲区域工人组织以及其他美国工会领导人联合领导的三十二工会和由共产党领导的十九工会。工人运动的分裂状态，严重地影响了对弗朗迪西政府的斗争，使罢工运动步调紊乱，不能发挥应有的威力。十九工会坚持不懈地为克服这种分裂状态，加强工会运动的团结和合作而努力，可是遭到了六十二工会，特别是三十二工会的领导人的抵制和反对。
    自然，这些不利于阿根廷民主进步的因素不是不能改变的。关键在于阿根廷民主力量特别是工人运动的团结一致。阿根廷的爱国民主力量不遗余力地争取一切进步力量，特别是工人运动的团结一致，以加强自己的斗争。人民运动从分裂走向团结的可能性是存在的，1月18日的总罢工和2月间六十二工会和十九工会的代表曾经联合举行一次会议，共同讨论了国内局势和斗争纲领，就表明了这一趋势。
