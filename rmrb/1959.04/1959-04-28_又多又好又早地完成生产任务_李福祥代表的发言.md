Fellow Representatives:
    I wholeheartedly agree with and support Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." The practice of the Chinese people has proven and will continue to prove the correctness of these reports. At the same time, we have full confidence in completing the grand national economic plan for this year as stipulated by the Congress. I am an ordinary driller from the Shanghai Boiler Factory, and the vivid examples from our factory clearly illustrate this point.
    The Shanghai Boiler Factory was originally the American imperialist firm, "Shenchang Foreign Company." At that time, it could only repair and assemble things like electric fans. When we took over in 1950, the American imperialist elements fled, wagging their tails and leaving behind two cartoons mocking us, ridiculing us for only being able to do hard labor and not being able to engage in the electrical equipment manufacturing industry. However, facts have repeatedly proven that their ridicule was in vain.
    Since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, the Shanghai Boiler Factory, like thousands of other factories, has undergone earth-shaking changes. We have developed from a factory with only one or two hundred people during the period of military control to a large-scale factory with more than four thousand people. Currently, we have produced medium and low-pressure boilers, and high-pressure boilers are also being trial-produced. The two hundred and eighty-ton medium-pressure boiler that has already been produced is as large as a six-story building and became a gift to celebrate "March 8th" International Women's Day, having been successfully manufactured by the end of February. Our factory buildings have grown from less than the size of one workshop before liberation to one hundred and sixty thousand square meters. Our new factory buildings, covering more than three hundred and eighty thousand square meters, are also under construction, and some will be put into production in May. Our factory's total output value in 1957 increased sixfold compared to 1952. If calculated based on boiler evaporation capacity, it has increased more than twentyfold. The imperialists' belief that our plan to achieve industrialization was doomed to failure has been completely shattered by us.
    1958 was a year of extraordinary leaps forward, a year of large-scale bumper harvests. Our factory's total output value alone increased more than threefold compared to 1957. This is the victory of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in the power generation equipment manufacturing industry, in the Shanghai Boiler Factory. This is the result of all the workers implementing the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, fully liberating their minds, and promoting the communist spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work. In 1958, all the workers in our factory put forward more than seven thousand technical innovation proposals, of which more than five thousand seven hundred have been implemented, saving more than seven thousand tons of raw materials and digging out more than five hundred and seventy thousand work hours, equivalent to the work of more than two hundred and fifty people for a year. In the past few months of last year, I put forward more than thirty technical innovation proposals, and calculated according to improved work efficiency, I completed three years' worth of work in seven months. One of the innovations was the creation of a "holeless tapping" tool when I was invited to promote advanced experience at the Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory, together with comrades from the Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory. The adoption of this tool increased work efficiency by a hundred times compared to the original manual operation, and four times compared to the original mechanical tapping. These have been promoted in many factories. This is just one example.

    Taking it to the Next Level
    "The road has been paved," this is the unanimous view of all the workers in our factory and all the workers in Shanghai regarding the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. At the beginning of this year, all the workers in the factory responded to the call of Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, at the Municipal Party Committee's industrial conference. The city's total industrial output value increased by 56 percent compared to 1958, and labor productivity increased by an average of 40 to 50 percent. Leap forward targets have taken root in people's hearts. All the workers in our factory unanimously guaranteed that the total output value would increase fourfold compared to last year, and that labor productivity would reach the level of one person doing the work of two, that is, an increase of 100 percent. In the short months of this year, according to incomplete statistics, our factory has already put forward eight thousand innovation proposals, of which three thousand have been implemented, which can save one hundred and seventy thousand work hours and three hundred tons of raw materials.
    Technical revolution is becoming deeper and deeper, and labor productivity is being tapped more and more. All the workers in the factory, in order to "jump up" and pick the fruits of the leap forward, our fitter and punch group in the metal workshop completed one year's worth of work in the first quarter. There are also many comrades who have proposed to complete three, five, or even ten years' worth of work in one year. Take myself as an example, I am a driller, and I have switched to being a borer due to the needs of boring work. Based on the characteristics of the boring machine and the key points of production in other types of work, I have successively put forward thirty-one technical innovation proposals, of which eight have been implemented, increasing work efficiency by two to ten times, and completing six years' worth of work in three months. In order to present a gift to the Second National People's Congress, I also used waste materials to manufacture an automatic gasket cutting machine and a double-tube punching die, which can respectively increase work efficiency by one to twelve times, and one person can watch several machines. Of course, these are just some very small contributions of my own, but there are thousands upon thousands of worker brothers across the country who are selflessly carrying out creative labor following the direction indicated by the Party. Therefore, we can say with full confidence that we will definitely be able to complete and over fulfill the state's greater leap forward plan for 1959.

    My Guarantee
    In order to complete and overfulfill this year's grand state plan, and to change our country's "poor and blank" face sooner, I am determined to dedicate all my strength and resolutely guarantee to:
    1. Increase personal labor productivity by one and a half times this year, that is, one person doing the work of two and a half people.
    2. Based on the experience since last year, continue to carry out technical revolution on a wider scale. I estimate that I will put forward one hundred innovation proposals this year, and after 60 to 70 percent of them are implemented, it will improve work efficiency equivalent to completing sixteen years of work.
    3. Become a versatile worker in production.
    In order to guarantee the completion and over fulfillment of the state plan for 1959, we will, together with the Shanghai worker brothers, not only complete the tasks that the state has already assigned to the Shanghai workers, but also be ready to accept additional tasks from the state at any time, and complete them with "only more, no less" of whatever the state asks us to do. We will complete whatever quality the state asks us to achieve with "only better, no worse," and we will complete it "only earlier, no later" within whatever time frame the state requires.
    Finally, regarding the Tibet issue, I firmly support Premier Zhou's report. We all know that Tibet is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory. The reactionary upper strata of the former Tibetan local government, colluding with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, actually openly betrayed the country and the people by launching an armed rebellion on March 10th and abducting the Dalai Lama, engaging in a "Tibetan independence" scheme. We firmly oppose this and express our indignation at the so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian foreign officials on April 18th. We warn all imperialists and Indian expansionists not to indulge in wishful thinking. The Chinese people of today will never allow you to interfere in our internal affairs. Your rash actions will inevitably end in complete failure.

    I wish the representatives good health!

### 又多又好又早地完成生产任务  李福祥代表的发言

    又多又好又早地完成生产任务
    李福祥代表的发言各位代表：
    我衷心地同意和拥护周总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”，彭真副委员长“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”，中国人民实践证明着，今后仍然将继续证明这些报告的正确性。同时我们也有充分的信心来完成大会所规定的今年宏伟的国民经济计划。我是上海锅炉厂的一个普通钻工，我们厂的各项生动事例清楚地说明了这一点。
    上海锅炉厂，原来是美帝国主义的慎昌洋行，当时只能修修配配电风扇之类的东西，当一九五○年，我们接管，美帝国主义分子逃跑的时候，他们夹着尾巴贴了两张漫画，讽刺我们，嘲笑我们只能当苦工，不能搞电力设备制造工业，但是，事实已一再证明，他们的嘲笑是落空了。
    第一个五年计划实施以来，上海锅炉厂正像千万个工厂一样，起着翻天复地的变化，我们已经从军管时只有一两百人的工厂，发展为四千多人的大型工厂了，目前已生产出中压低压锅炉，而且高压锅炉也正在试制中，已生产出的二百八十吨中压锅炉，装起来就有六层大楼那样大，成为向“三八”节献礼的礼品，在二月底就已制造成功了。我们工厂的厂房已从解放前不到现在一个车间那么大，发展成十六万平方公尺，我们三十八万多平方公尺的新厂房又正在兴建，而且在五月份就有部分投入生产。我们厂一九五七年的总产值比一九五二年增长六倍，如按锅炉蒸发量计算，则增加了二十多倍，帝国主义认为我们实现工业化的计划是注定要失败的幻想，已被我们彻底粉碎了。
    一九五八年是特大跃进的一年，是大面积丰收的一年，我们厂仅总产值就比一九五七年增长了三倍多，这是党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线，在发电设备制造工业，在上海锅炉厂的胜利。这是全体职工们贯彻了党中央和毛主席的指示，充分地解放了思想，发扬共产主义风格，苦干，实干，和巧干的成果。在一九五八年，我们全厂职工共提出了七千多条技术革新建议，已实现五千七百多条，共节约原材料七千多吨，挖出工时五十七万多个，相当于二百五十余人干一年的工作量。我在去年几个月中提出三十多条技术革新建议，按提高工作效率计算，以七个月的时间，完成了三年的工作量。其中一项革新是在我应邀去杭州机床厂推广先进经验的时候，和杭州机床厂的同志一起创造了“无孔攻丝”的工具。这项工具的采用，比原来手工操作提高工效一百倍，比原机械攻丝提高四倍，这些，已在许多工厂推行了。这是举的一个例子。
    百尺竿头更进一步
    “路已走出来了”，这是我厂的全体职工和全上海工人对一九五八年大跃进的经验一致看法。今年年初全厂职工响应了市委第一书记柯庆施同志在市委工业会议上的号召，全市工业总产值比一九五八年增长百分之五十六，劳动生产率平均增长百分之四十到百分之五十，跃进指标，已经深入人心，我们厂的全体职工一致保证总产值比去年增长四倍，劳动生产力，要作到一人干两人的活，即增长百分之一百，在今年短短的几个月中，据不完全的统计，我全厂已提出了八千条革新建议，已实现了三千条，可以节省工时十七万个，还节省原材料三百吨。
    技术革命愈革愈深，劳动生产力愈挖愈大，全厂职工们为了“跳一跳”把跃进果子摘下来，我们金工车间的钳冲小组，在第一季度已完成一年的工作量，还有不少同志提出一年要完成三年、五年、十几年的工作量，就拿我来说，我是钻工，因搪工的需要，改作搪工了，根据搪床的特点及其他工种生产上的关键，先后已提出了三十一项技术革新建议，已实行八项，提高工作效率二至十倍，在三个月的时间内完成了六年的工作量。为了给第二届全国人民代表大会献礼，我还利用废料制造一台垫啳自动切割机床，双管冲模一付，分别可以提高工作效力一至十二倍，而一人可以看几台。当然这些只是我个人一些很微小的贡献，但是全国有千千万万的工人兄弟都遵循着党所指示的方向忘我地进行着创造性劳动，因此我们就能满怀信心地说：我们一定能够完成和超额完成一九五九年国家的更大跃进计划。
    我的保证
    为了完成和超额完成今年宏伟的国家计划，更早的改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，我下定决心献出自己的一切力量，坚决保证作到：
    1、今年个人劳动生产力比去年增长一倍半即一人干二人半的活。
    2、根据去年以来的经验，继续更广泛地大搞技术革命，我预计今年内提革新建议一百条，并做到百分之六十至七十实现以后，就可提高工作效力相当于完成十六年的工作量。
    3、生产上成为多面手。
    为了保证完成和超额完成一九五九年国家计划，我们将和上海工人兄弟一起，不但要完成国家已交给上海工人的任务，而且随时听候国家增加任务，做到国家要我们做多少任务“只多不少”地完成它，国家要我们完成什么样质量，我们“只好不坏”地完成它，国家要我们什么时间内完成，我们就“只早不迟”地完成它。
    最后有关西藏问题，我坚决拥护周总理的报告，我们大家知道西藏是中国神圣领土的一部分，原西藏地方政府的上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，竟然在三月十日公开叛国叛人民发动武装叛乱，并劫持达赖喇嘛，搞什么“西藏独立”的诡计，我们坚决反对，并对四月十八日由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，表示愤慨。我们警告一切帝国主义和印度扩张主义者，不要痴心妄想，现在的中国人民，决不允许你们干涉我国内政，你们的轻举妄动，必然要彻底失败。
    祝代表们身体健康！
