Xinhua News Agency, April 26th, New Delhi Dispatch: The "Tribune's" editor, Prem Bhatia, said in a weekly column on April 21st that the Dalai Lama is receiving special "attention" in India because Indian authorities are dissatisfied with China's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet.

The article, titled "Why the Dalai Lama Receives Special Attention," said that as the Dalai Lama slowly made his way from the Indian border to Mussoorie, "the Indian government entertained him at every stop along the Dalai Lama's journey, an entertainment that leaves no doubt that he is receiving much more than the normal care given to political refugees."

The article stated that regarding this "hospitality," "one very possible reason," "a reason that is far more important from a diplomatic point of view, is that Nehru wishes to express indirect dissatisfaction with China's position on the Tibetan issue." The article continued, "Although India cannot completely justifiably reprimand the Chinese on an issue that has already been recognized as China's internal affair, it can show its attitude by indirectly condemning China's untrustworthiness."

The author of this article also said that the Dalai Lama's hospitality "probably has other reasons." In this regard, he mentioned, "Nehru believes that if the Chinese are made to feel that it is impossible not to treat this Tibetan leader as a force in Tibetan affairs, then the possibility of the Dalai Lama returning to Tibet in a position similar to his original one will increase. Moreover, the world's attention to the Dalai Lama may prompt the issue of the relationship between China and Tibet to become the world's most noticed issue."

The "Indian Times" commentator, Verghese, commented on April 22nd about the meeting between Nehru and the Dalai Lama, revealing the Dalai Lama's situation in India. He said, "The Dalai Lama is a young man and will certainly pay attention to the advice Nehru may give him."

Although some Indian newspapers fantasize that the Dalai Lama being kidnapped to India would create a so-called "favorable situation" for Indian expansionists, some newspapers have already revealed a sense of embarrassment. A recent issue of the Indian People's Alliance's mouthpiece, the "Organizer" weekly, said that the Dalai Lama's entry into India is "both beneficial and harmful, and as time goes by, it will embarrass us."

This weekly believes that kidnapping the Dalai Lama into India has caused India to "shoulder obligations that we cannot fully and satisfactorily fulfill."

This weekly said, "They have left us with endless trouble. Only the future can show how we intend to deal with the developing situation in order to ensure our sovereignty, the feelings of the Tibetans, and the unique position of the Dalai Lama himself...."

### 印度“论坛报”发表评论指出  印度当局特别礼遇达赖别有原因

    印度“论坛报”发表评论指出
    印度当局特别礼遇达赖别有原因
    新华社26日讯　新德里消息：  “论坛报”主编普雷姆·巴蒂亚在4月21日的一篇星期专文中说，达赖喇嘛在印度受到特别“注意”是因为印度当局对中国平息西藏叛乱心怀不满。
    这篇题为“达赖喇嘛受到特别注意的原因”的文章说，当达赖喇嘛在从印度边境向穆索里缓缓行进的时候，“印度政府在达赖喇嘛的行程经过的每一站招待他，这种招待使人不容怀疑地感到，他所得到的东西比给予政治避难者的正常照顾要多得多。”
    文章说，对于这种“款待”，“一个非常可能的原因”，“一个从外交的角度来看是远为重要的原因，是尼赫鲁希望对中国在西藏问题的立场表示间接的不满。”文章接着说，“虽然印度不能完全正当地在已经被承认是中国内政的问题上训斥中国人，但是它可以在通过这种间接谴责中国不守信义的方式来表明它的态度。”
    这篇文章的作者又说，达赖喇嘛受到款待“大概还有另外的原因。”在这方面他提到，“尼赫鲁认为，如果使中国人感到，要不把这个西藏领袖当作西藏事务中的一种力量是办不到的，那末，达赖喇嘛以类似原有的地位回到西藏的可能性将会增加。而且世界对达赖喇嘛的注意，可能促使中国和西藏的关系问题成为世界最注意的问题。”
    “印度时报”的评论员维尔格斯在4月22日评论尼赫鲁和达赖喇嘛会见时说出了达赖喇嘛在印度的处境。他说，“达赖喇嘛是个年青人，当然会注意尼赫鲁可能给他的忠告。”
    尽管印度一些报刊幻想达赖喇嘛被劫持到印度去会对印度扩张主义分子造成所谓“有利的局势”，但有些报刊已经表露出一种为难的情绪。最近一期印度人民同盟的喉舌“组织家报”周刊说，达赖喇嘛进入印度“既有利又有弊，而随着时间的消失它会使我们为难。”
    这家周刊认为，把达赖喇嘛劫持入印度，使印度“担负了我们不可能完全和圆满地履行的义务。”
    这家周刊说，“人家给我们丢下了一个无穷的麻烦。只有未来才能表明我们怎样打算来对付发展中的形势以便确保我们的主权、西藏人的感情和达赖喇嘛本人的独一无二的地位……。”
