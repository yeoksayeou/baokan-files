    Vampires on the Silver Screen
    Gu Fan
    In recent years, people living in the United States, Britain, and other countries of the "free world," whether they like it or not, are likely to see all kinds of demons and monsters on the silver screen or television screen when they walk into a movie theater or watch television, making people feel nauseous or terrified.
    It turns out that horror movies are all the rage in the United States and Britain. In Hollywood, the American film city, twelve production companies are working day and night to create horror. Big bosses in the British film industry don't seem willing to lag behind, and are determined to be brothers with the United States in creating horror.
    These outrageous films contain a large number of insulting scenes and dialogues. For example, "Cat Woman" depicts a girl who turns into a beast every night. The protagonist of "Vampire Resurrection" is a medical professor praised by American adults in the film as a "loyal servant of science," repeatedly and bloodily dissecting human heads, thighs, and hands with surgical knives and electric saws. He then puts these limbs together into a hideous vampire, who then goes on to kill several people.
    This kind of absurd and poisonous film is rampant everywhere in the West, which cannot but arouse the protest of millions of mothers and people with humanity. Whether they live in London or Washington, Detroit or Liverpool, the call for banning the production and screening of horror films is becoming more and more widespread.
    However, the cries of millions of mothers are not heeded by the ruling classes of the United States and Britain. In their eyes, "humanity" is far less important than the value of money.
    Thus, following the cues of the tycoons, some "scholars" and "experts" in the United States and Britain have spoken out. The British "Film Fan Magazine" published the talks of several "authoritative psychiatrists," who said: "Although many people in society have criticized these monster horror films," they believe that horror films are not only "harmless to the audience," but also allow young audiences to "gain a temporary sense of pleasure and satisfaction in their hearts and minds."
    Professor Grojean, a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in the United States, said even more bluntly that vampire-like "horror films have a healthy effect on psychology; the more terrifying, the more beneficial." Their reasoning is:
    Although American newspapers are "full of tragic news and pictures, murders, rapes, robberies, fires... are inevitable tragedies in real life," this is not enough; there is a need for novels, comic strips, and horror films that are even more terrifying than the social reality of the United States, to "remind" American citizens to realize that it is normal and destined to "live under the inevitable tragedies in life." In this way, when faced with unemployment, poverty, and various disasters, they will think of the plots of horror films, and think, "Fortunately, I have not suffered such misfortunes." As a result, people will not resist the capitalist social system.
    After reading this argument, people suddenly realized that vampires and zombies, in addition to being enough for filmmakers to stuff large amounts of money into their pockets, also have many "benefits" that can cause neurasthenia, paralysis, and make people believe in ghosts and gods and fate. No wonder that today, when the storm of economic depression has swept across the "free world," Hollywood has produced so many devils and zombies.
    However, in my opinion, although the tycoons of the United States and Britain have worked hard, and their scholars and experts have done a lot of work, their wishful thinking of using horror films to numb people's hearts will ultimately be in vain. Vampire scenes do indeed cause a small number of children to be frightened for life, and even suffer from mental illness. However, it also makes more people realize how shameful and absurd the decay and depravity of Western culture has become, and think about whether the social system that produces such "movies" is on its deathbed; more and more people will realize that the vampires on the screen are fake, but in society there is indeed a small group of vampires who live by exploiting laborers.

    银幕上的吸血鬼
    古凡
    近年来，居住在美、英以及“自由世界”其它国度的人们，不管本人乐意不乐意，只要走进电影院或观看电视，就可能会在银幕或萤光板上看到各式各样的妖魔鬼怪，使人感到恶心或者被吓得毛发皆竖。
    原来，恐怖影片正在美国和英国大行其道。美国的影城好莱坞有十二家制片公司正在为了制造恐怖而日夜忙碌。英国电影业的大老板们似乎也不甘落后，决心在制造恐怖方面与美国称兄道弟。
    在这些伤天害理的影片中，有着大量对人的侮辱的镜头和对话。例如“猫女妖”描写一个少女每到夜间就变成一只野兽。“吸血鬼复活”的主角是一个在影片中被美国的大人先生们推崇为“科学忠仆”的医学教授，屡次用手术刀和电锯血淋淋地宰割人体的头颅、大腿和手，然后把这些肢体凑并成一个面目狰狞的吸血鬼，再让这个吸血鬼接连杀死好几个人。
    这一类荒谬绝伦的毒害人心的影片在西方到处泛滥，不能不引起千百万母亲们和人性未泯的人们的抗议。不论她们住在伦敦或华盛顿，底特律或利物浦，要求禁止拍制和放映恐怖片的呼声愈来愈广泛。
    可是，千百万母亲们的这种呼声，并不为美、英统治阶级所理睬。在他们的眼底，“人性”云云远不及钱的价值重要。
    于是，仰承着大亨们的眼色，美国和英国的一些“学者”和“专家”们就开腔了。英国的“影迷杂志”发表了几个“权威精神病学专家”的谈话，他们说：“尽管有很多社会人士对这些神怪恐怖影片批评攻讦”，可是，他们认为恐怖影片不仅“对观众没有害”，而且年青的观众看了，可以“得到心灵精神上一时的愉快满足”。
    美国南加利福尼亚大学的心理学教授葛罗珍更直截了当地说，吸血鬼之类“恐怖影片对于心理具有健康作用，愈是可怕，愈是有益”。他们的理由是：　　虽然美国报纸上“充满着悲剧性的新闻和图片，谋杀、强奸、抢劫、火灾……都是在现实生活中所不可免的悲剧”，可是，这还不够，还需要比美国的社会现实更加恐怖的小说，连环图和恐怖电影，来“提醒”美国公民认识到“在生命中所必有的悲剧之下生活”是正常的，命中注定的。这样，在遇到失业贫困和各种灾难的时候，就会想到恐怖影片的情节，想到“幸而我还安然的没有遭受到如此的不幸”。于是，人们就不会去反抗资本主义社会制度。
    看了这种论调，人们才恍然大悟，原来吸血鬼和僵尸之类，除了足以使制片商把大量钞票往口袋里塞以外，还有这许多可能使人神经衰弱、麻痹昏懵、相信鬼神命运摆布等等“益处”。怪不得恰恰在“自由世界”吹遍了经济萧条风暴的今天，好莱坞涌现了这么多的魔鬼和僵尸了。
    不过，据我看来，美国和英国的大亨们虽然用心良苦，他们的学者、专家也总算效了不少犬马之劳。可是，他们希冀用恐怖片来麻痹人心的痴心妄想，到头来终将是徒劳的。吸血鬼的镜头确实使一小部分儿童看了终生惊悖，甚至罹了精神病。但是，它也使更多的人认识到西方文化腐朽和堕落到多么可耻和荒唐的地步，想到产生这种“电影”的一天天烂下去的社会制度是否死期将至；将有愈来愈多的人认识到，银幕上的吸血鬼是虚假的，而社会上却真有一小撮靠剥削劳动者为生的吸血鬼。
