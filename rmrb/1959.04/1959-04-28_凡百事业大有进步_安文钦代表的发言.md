    I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report.
    Since I took leave and returned to my hometown for recuperation in the winter of 1956, I have been silently observing and deeply feel that all undertakings in our county have made great progress since liberation. Now, there are no gamblers, opium addicts, prostitutes, beggars, thieves, or vagrants in the locality. The streets are extremely quiet without any fighting or quarrels, and the alleys are very clean without any filth or garbage. In 1958, the people of the whole country achieved tremendous accomplishments in the Great Leap Forward. Recently, the people of Tibet, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, quickly quelled the rebellion and are firmly advancing towards a bright and great socialist future. These events are sufficient to prove that the people of the whole country are responding to the government's call, everyone is energized, striving to be the best, and marching forward on the socialist road.
    It has been said that even a rich and powerful country will perish if it loves war; if imperialism exists, forgetting war is also dangerous; strengthening our military and preparing for war should not be neglected. If U.S. imperialism boasts of its wealth and power and loves war and enjoys war, then China abides by the warning against forgetting war, preparing for war and responding to war. The distinction between good and bad, beauty and ugliness, is far apart. Reading the news that Khrushchev delivered a speech at the Leipzig Trade Union Congress, saying that the most important task for everyone at present is to maintain peace, etc. These words make the sound of peace resonate throughout the universe, and the atmosphere of security fills friendly countries at home and abroad. However, U.S. imperialism is out of touch with the times, does not know how to advance or retreat, its ambition is不死, willingly takes the lead in war, and attempts to undermine peace and security. Using Thailand and South Vietnam as bases, it conducts conspiracies against Laos and Cambodia, trying to tear up the Geneva Accords and turn Indochina into a sphere of American colonial influence. It does not consider its virtue or measure its strength, like striking a drum made of gourds at Leimen, or wielding a large axe at Banmen. Its failure and demise can be awaited imminently. Regarding the most despicable and shameful Tito fabricating rumors and slandering China and the Soviet Union, it is like an ox panting at the moon, or a dog barking at Yao. The truth and falsehood are obvious, and the people of the world have their own fair judgment, so it can be ignored. Those who govern a country should share rewards and punishments with the people. Their approval or disapproval should not be swayed by their own likes, dislikes, joys, or angers. Therefore, rewards should not overlook those who are far away, and punishments should not favor those who are near. Titles should not be obtained without merit, and penalties should not be waived for the powerful. This is why both the wise and the foolish forget themselves, and the world will be governed naturally.

    凡百事业大有进步
    安文钦代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告。
    我于一九五六年冬请假回籍休养以来，默为视察，第觉我县自解放后凡百事业大有进步。现在地方上无赌棍无烟鬼无土娼无乞丐无贼盗无游民，街市上无打架吵嘴的极其安静，路巷里无污秽垃圾物非常清洁。一九五八年全国人民在大跃进中更获得了巨大成就。最近西藏人民在人民解放军的协助下，迅速平定了叛乱，坚定的向光明伟大的社会主义前进。这些事迹，足可证明全国人民都在响应政府的号召，人人都鼓起了干劲，无不力争上游，在社会主义道路上向前迈进。
    盖尝论之，国虽富强，好战必亡；帝国主义存在，忘战亦危，强兵备战，不可怠也。若美帝国主义自诩其为富强国而好战而乐战，我中国守忘战亦危之戒，是备战是应战，其间优劣美恶之分，相去远矣。读报载赫鲁晓夫在来比锡工会代表会上发表演说，当前我们大家最重要的任务是维护和平等语。是语也，使和平之声浪震荡于宇宙之间，安全之气象充沛于中外友国。而美帝国主义不识时务、不知进退、野心不死、甘为戎首、企图破坏和平与安全，以泰国和南越为基地，对老挝、柬埔寨进行阴谋活动，想要撕毁日内瓦协议，把印度支那变成美国殖民势力范围，其不度德，不量力，犹之桴布鼓而过雷门、持大斧而弄班门，其失败与灭亡可立而待也。关于最卑鄙最可耻的铁托捏造蜚语，污蔑中苏，等于吴牛喘月，桀犬吠尧，其间是非真伪昭然若揭，举世人民自有公论，置之不理可也。凡为国者对于爵赏刑罚与天下共，其可否勿以己之爱憎喜怒移之，故赏不遗远，罚不阿近，爵不可以无功取，刑不可以权贵免，此贤愚所以佥忘其身而天下自理矣。
