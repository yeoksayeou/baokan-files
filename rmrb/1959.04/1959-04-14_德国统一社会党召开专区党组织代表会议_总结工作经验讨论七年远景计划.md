Berlin, April 13th (Reported by this newspaper) - From the end of February to the end of March, the Socialist Unity Party organizations in the fourteen districts of the German Democratic Republic, the capital city of Greater Berlin, and the Wismut region successively held district, city, and local party congresses. The main purpose of the meetings was to review the implementation of the resolutions of the Fifth Party Congress last year, summarize work experience, and discuss the seven-year perspective plan.

From the materials that have been published, it can be seen that the Party Congresses in each district focused on summarizing the work experience of the Party in the recent period in the following aspects: the experience of closely combining the struggle to complete the main economic tasks with the political struggle; improving work style, strengthening ties with the masses, especially mobilizing the masses to strive for "socialist labor teams" and organizing "socialist work collectives"; and the experience of improving labor productivity and accelerating the pace of socialist construction through scientific and technological progress. These are precisely the aspects that the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party has frequently emphasized in the recent period. The Party Congresses in each district also emphasized the idea that "the completion of economic tasks is the yardstick for checking the Party's work."

The Party Congress in the Halle district attracted great interest. This district is one of the industrial centers of the German Democratic Republic, possessing half of the country's chemical industry. A year ago, the work in this district was not advanced in various aspects. After a year of arduous work by the district Party organization, great progress has now been made in all aspects. The rural work in this district is also the most advanced in the country. At this Party Congress, the Central Committee of the Party awarded the banner of the work competition of the five industrial districts of Berlin, Dresden, Halle, Karl-Marx-Stadt, and Leipzig to the Party organization of the Halle district.

When discussing the seven-year perspective plan, each district, based on the overall tasks and combined with the characteristics of the local area, put forward many slogans to encourage the masses' enthusiasm for production. The Party organization in the capital Berlin decided to take the lead in all tasks. The Potsdam district, which surrounds Berlin, is responsible for supplying Greater Berlin with many necessities of life, and it put forward the slogan of becoming "Berlin's dairy farm." This district launched a "pearl necklace" movement in the countryside to beautify the countryside, requiring each village to regard itself as a "pearl" on the "necklace." The Brandenburg steel plant in this district decided to strive to reach a steel output of 1.5 million tons by 1965, equivalent to 150% of this year's plan.

At the Party Congresses in each district, after reviewing the implementation of resolutions, summarizing and exchanging advanced experiences, and discussing the seven-year perspective plan, the people's enthusiasm for production was generally high. A nationwide movement to discuss the seven-year perspective plan is unfolding across the country. Currently, socialist labor competitions have been launched between some districts, between districts and counties, between factories, and between cooperatives.

　　德国统一社会党召开专区党组织代表会议
　　总结工作经验讨论七年远景计划
    本报柏林13日电　德意志民主共和国十四个专区和首都大柏林市以及维斯穆特地方的统一社会党组织，从2月底到3月末先后举行了专区、市、地方的党的代表会议。会议主要是检查去年党的第五次代表大会决议执行情况，总结工作经验，讨论七年远景计划。
    从已经公布的材料中可以看到，各个专区的党代表会议着重从以下一些方面总结了最近一个时期党的工作经验：把完成主要经济任务的斗争和政治斗争紧密结合起来的经验，改进工作作风，加强和群众联系，特别是发动群众争取“社会主义劳动队”、组织“社会主义工作集体”的经验；通过科学技术进步，提高劳动生产率，加快社会主义建设速度的经验。而这些方面正是最近一个时期统一社会党中央委员会经常强调的。每个专区的党代表会议还强调了“经济任务完成的情况是检查党的工作的标尺”的思想。
    哈雷专区的党代表会议引起人们很大兴趣。这个专区是德意志民主共和国工业中心之一，拥有占全国半数的化学工业。一年前，这个专区的各项工作并不先进，经过专区党组织一年来的艰苦工作，现在在各个方面都获得了巨大的进展。这个专区的农村工作在全国也是最先进的。在这次党代表会议上，党中央委员会将柏林、德累斯顿、哈雷、卡尔、马克思斯塔特和来比锡五个工业专区工作竞赛的锦旗发给哈雷专区的党组织。
    在讨论未来七年远景计划时，各个专区根据总的任务结合本地的特点提出了许多鼓舞群众生产积极性的口号。首都柏林的党组织决定要在各项工作中走在前面。波茨坦专区在柏林周围，负有在许多生活必需品方面供应大柏林市的任务，这个专区提出了要成为“柏林的牛奶厂”的口号。这个专区在农村中展开了一个“珍珠项链”运动来美化农村，要求每个村庄都把自己看作是“项链”上的一颗“珍珠”。这个专区的勃兰登堡钢厂决定，到1965年争取钢产量达到一百五十万吨，相当于今年计划的150％。
    在各个专区的党代表会上，经过检查决议执行情况，总结、交流先进经验和讨论七年远景计划，人们的生产热情普遍高涨。一个全民讨论七年远景计划的运动正在全国各展地开。目前，一些专区和专区、县和县、工厂和工厂、合作社和合作社之间已经展开了社会主义劳动竞赛。
