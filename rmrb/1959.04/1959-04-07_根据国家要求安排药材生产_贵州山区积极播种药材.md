Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, April 5th: Many people's communes in the mountainous areas of Guizhou are actively engaged in spring planting of Chinese medicinal materials. According to preliminary statistics, more than 40,000 mu of various Chinese medicinal materials have been planted throughout the province. In Zunyi Prefecture, the main producing areas of medicinal materials such as Meitan, Zheng'an, and Tongzi counties, more than 11,000 mu of medicinal materials such as white peony, safflower, Rehmannia glutinosa, rhubarb, and angelica have been sown. In Tongren Prefecture, the main producing areas of medicinal materials such as Yinjiang, Tongren, and Sinan counties, more than 20,000 mu of Evodia rutaecarpa have been planted. Before planting medicinal materials, all people's communes formulated production plans according to national requirements and arranged the plans to each management area or production team, uniformly arranged land and fertilizers, and organized professional teams for management. The relevant leading departments of Guizhou Province also trained and organized more than 100 instructors to go to the people's communes to guide the planting of medicinal materials.
    The people's communes in various places have promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation in planting. For example, Dushan County transferred 24,000 jin of Rehmannia glutinosa seeds to other counties. The Jinjun People's Commune and the Meitan Medicinal Material Farm in Meitan County transferred a total of 170,000 seedlings of seeds such as white peony. Some communes also organized the masses to go to the mountains to excavate wild medicinal materials for trial planting.
    Guizhou Province is one of the famous producing areas of Chinese medicinal materials in my country, with very rich medicinal material resources. More than 500 kinds of drugs have now been proven to be effective. This year, the province plans to cultivate 240 kinds of Chinese medicinal materials, with a planting area of 100,000 mu, double that of last year. (Attached picture)

    根据国家要求安排药材生产
    贵州山区积极播种药材
    据新华社贵阳5日电　贵州山区许多人民公社积极展开中药材春播工作。据初步统计，全省已种植各种中药材四万多亩。遵义专区中药材主要产地湄潭、正安、桐梓等县，已播种白芍、红花、生地、大黄、白芷等药材一万一千多亩。铜仁专区中药材主要产地印江、铜仁、思南等县，播种的茣萸达两万多亩。各人民公社在播种药材前，都根据国家要求订出了生产计划，并把计划安排到各管理区或生产队，统一安排土地和肥料等，组织专业队经营管理。贵州省有关领导部门还训练和组织辅导员一百多人，分到各人民公社指导种植药材。
    各地人民公社在播种中发扬了互助协作精神。如独山县调给其他县的生地种，达二万四千斤。湄潭县进军人民公社和湄潭药材场，共调出白芍等种子十七万株。有的公社还组织群众上山挖掘野生药材，进行试种。
    贵州省是我国中药材的著名产区之一，药材资源非常丰富。现已证明确有疗效的药物有五百多种。今年全省计划培植二百四十种中药材，种植面积十万亩，比去年增加一倍。（附图片）
