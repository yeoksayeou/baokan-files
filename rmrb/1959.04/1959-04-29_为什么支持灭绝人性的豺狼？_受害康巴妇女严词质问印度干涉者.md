Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 28th. Two Tibetan women who had been brutally harmed by Khampa rebels vehemently denounced the imperialists and Indian expansionists for supporting man-eating jackals - the reactionary upper strata of Tibet.

Ge Ze Lamu and Jia Zhu Lama expressed great indignation at the imperialists and Indian expansionists who slandered our People's Government as "suppressing those fighting for freedom," vilified us as "barbaric," and expressed "sympathy" for the rebellion of the Tibetan upper reactionary group.

Jia Zhu Lama, touching her face with a missing ear and an artificial nose, said excitedly: "My nose and ear were cut off by the Khampa rebels, beasts in kasayas. The People's Government sent me to the best hospital in Yunnan Province, where I received treatment and recuperation for more than a year, and they also fitted me with an artificial nose. Who is barbaric? I think the real barbarians are those man-eating rebels." This Tibetan girl was forced to be a slave when she was five years old and couldn't even hold zanba (zanba is the staple food of the Tibetan people) herself, feeding cattle and horses, living a subhuman life for six years. Jia Zhu Lama said: Now this slave owner has gone to Lhasa to become a rebel. The imperialists and Indian expansionists sympathize with them. This means that they want our Tibetan people to suffer forever. How can we agree to this?

Ge Ze Lamu, another Tibetan girl, also had her right leg broken by the Khampa rebels. After half a year of free treatment, she has now recovered her health, but still has a bowl-sized scar. She said: "The bad guys from imperialism and India are making a lot of noise, saying that we don't have freedom of religious belief. I have never seen the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government disrespecting religious belief in any way. Some lamas among the rebels are jackals in Buddhist robes. After they injured me, they wanted to rape me. Is this what they call 'fighters for freedom'? What they are fighting for is the 'freedom' to exploit and harm people. What is there to 'sympathize' with these beastly jackals?"

Ge Ze Lamu and Jia Zhu Lama were particularly angered by the rude behavior of the Indian thugs who insulted our leader. They said: "Chairman Mao led us to liberate ourselves. He is the great leader of all ethnic groups in our country. Whoever slanders him slanders the 650 million people of our country. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate."

    为什么支持灭绝人性的豺狼？
    受害康巴妇女严词质问印度干涉者
    新华社昆明28日电　曾惨遭康巴叛乱分子毒害的两名藏族妇女，痛斥帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子支持灭绝人性的豺狼——西藏上层反动集团。
    格则拉姆和加竹拉玛对帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子污蔑我们人民政府是“镇压争取自由的人”，谩骂我们“野蛮”，表示“同情”西藏上层反动集团的叛乱，感到非常义愤。
    加竹拉玛抚着自己被截去一只耳朵和装着假鼻子的脸，激动地说道：“我的鼻子和耳朵是被身披袈裟的野兽康巴叛乱分子割掉的。人民政府把我送到云南省最好的医院，治疗和休养了一年多，还给我装了假鼻子。到底是谁野蛮？我看真正的野蛮人是那些灭绝人性的叛乱分子。”这个藏族姑娘当她五岁的时候，自己还不会拿糌粑吃（糌粑是藏族人民的饭食），就被迫去做奴隶，喂牛喂马，过了六年非人的奴隶生活。加竹拉玛说：现在这个奴隶主跑到拉萨当叛匪去了。帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子同情他们，这就是要我们藏族人民永远受苦受难，我们怎么能答应呢？
    格则拉姆这个藏族姑娘也是被康巴叛乱分子打坏右腿，经过半年的免费治疗，现在已经恢复健康，但至今仍留下了碗大的伤疤。她说：“帝国主义和印度的坏家伙吵吵闹闹，说我们宗教信仰不得自由，我从来没有看到解放军和人民政府有什么不尊重宗教信仰的地方。叛乱分子中的一些喇嘛，是披着佛衣的豺狼，当他们打伤我以后，还要奸污我，这是什么‘争取自由的战士’？他们争取的是剥削人、残害人的‘自由’，这些野兽豺狼有什么值得‘同情’呢？”
    格则拉姆和加竹拉玛对印度暴徒侮辱我国领袖的无礼行为特别气愤，她们说：“毛主席领导我们翻了身，他是我国各族人民的伟大领袖，谁诬蔑了他，就是诬蔑了我国六亿五千万人民，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。”
