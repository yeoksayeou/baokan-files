    Omani Nationalists Strike at British Troops
    Cairo dispatch: The Omani Imam's office in Cairo announced here on the 14th that Omani nationalists recently engaged in fierce battles with the British occupation forces, killing forty British soldiers and destroying a number of British military trucks.
    South Korean Farmers and Fishermen Heavily in Debt
    Seoul dispatch: According to a report in the Seoul "Kyunghyang Shinmun," South Korean authorities officially estimate that the total debt of South Korean farmers and fishermen at the end of last year had reached over 140 billion won.
    The year-by-year increase in the debt of South Korean farmers illustrates their increasing impoverishment under the oppression of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique. In 1954, the average debt per South Korean farming household was 8,930 won; by October of last year, it had increased to over 54,300 won.
    Italian and Turkish Foreign Ministers Hold Talks
    Rome dispatch: Italy is actively expanding its capital into the Eastern Mediterranean region, and will export capital goods worth a total of 50 million US dollars to Turkey to assist in that country's so-called "industrialization." This was announced after the Italian Foreign Minister Pella and the Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu held two days of talks in Rome on the 13th and 14th, during which they discussed international issues and relations between the two countries.

    阿曼民族主义者打击英军

    南朝鲜农民和渔民负债累累
    汉城讯：据汉城“京乡新闻”报道，南朝鲜当局官方估计，去年年底，南朝鲜农民和渔民的总负债额已达一千四百多亿圜。
    南朝鲜农民负债额的逐年增加，说明了他们在美国和李承晚集团的压榨下日益贫困。1954年，南朝鲜每户农民平均负债八千九百三十圜；到去年10月份，已增加到五万四千三百多圜。
