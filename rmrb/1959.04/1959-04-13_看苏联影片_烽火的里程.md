　　Watching the Soviet Film "The Fiery Miles"
　　Ai Miao
    The train gallops across the open country, the roofs and carriages packed with people. In one carriage, a Red Army political commissar has been shot and wounded by White bandit spies, and is in critical condition. He is anxious to find a Bolshevik to report to the city headquarters: counter-revolutionaries are plotting an uprising in the city. Professor Sherako, an elderly doctor trying to save the commissar, helps him find Zavrazhin, a security worker and Bolshevik. After carefully observing him, the commissar tells him: "The enemy is going to riot in the city, and there are traitors in our headquarters, waiting for a signal, which will be brought into the city by a man using the alias Viktor. That's all I know about this man. He also has someone with him, the person who shot me... You must go yourself, you can't send anyone else!" Zavrazhin bravely undertakes this arduous task.
    The Soviet film "The Fiery Miles" unfolds its story in this way, tightly connecting the audience's attention with the fate of Zavrazhin.
    Now, who arrives in the city first – Zavrazhin or the White bandit spy – becomes the most acute and decisive struggle. But Zavrazhin can only find two horse-drawn carriages to break through the White bandits who have cut off the road and get to the city. The elderly doctor and nurse Katya, who are also eager to get to the city to perform medical tasks, and the tragic actor Orlinski, become his companions.
    Zavrazhin needs a machine gunner. However, the cunning and vicious White bandit spy using the alias Viktor takes advantage of the fact that he has shot his accomplice, who was about to be exposed, to win the trust of the security workers and act as Zavrazhin's machine gunner. The presence of the spy makes the fiery journey even more treacherous.
    Sure enough, after the first night's rest, Viktor, the white fox, takes advantage of Zavrazhin's momentary negligence, kills the young driver, hacks the horse's legs, and rides a horse into the city. As a result, the situation becomes even more urgent. If they cannot get into the city in time, the entire city will be destroyed in the White bandit uprising. Because Zavrazhin's kind heart moves a mute, he helps them find two horses, and they are able to get back on the road. Zavrazhin has to hurry on, while also resisting the White bandits who are chasing them from all directions. Bullets whistle past their ears and graze their chests. This is a battle of life and death against overwhelming odds. The driver and the tragic actor are sacrificed, and the kind old doctor is injured! At this time, Zavrazhin's only companion – the taciturn nurse Katya – unhesitatingly raises her whip, drives the carriage at full speed, assists Zavrazhin in breaking through the encirclement of the White bandits, and finally arrives in the city, uncovering the enemy's conspiracy and completing the important task entrusted to him by the commissar in his critical condition.
    Through the short, fiery journey, the film director portrays the heroes who consolidated and developed the Soviet regime after the October Revolution, who walked the arduous road of the domestic war filled with flames, and who created a happy life.
    The director uses the image of nurse Katya on the carriage watching Zavrazhin's pair of black and sturdy hands to convey how the Bolshevik Zavrazhin grew from a miner who shed blood and sweat for capitalists into a conscious revolutionary. Class instinct and revolutionary training enable the kind and simple Zavrazhin to deeply understand the significance of defending the Soviet regime. He is merciless towards the enemy. In order to complete the task assigned by the Party, in the face of a dangerous situation with a disparity in strength, he demonstrates unparalleled bravery, and together with Katya, stubbornly fights the enemy.
    Hatred for the enemies of the Soviet Union makes Katya the most tenacious fighter and Zavrazhin's most courageous and loyal driver. She selflessly assists Zavrazhin, who is fighting alone, to break through the enemy's hail of bullets and complete the glorious task of saving the entire city from disaster.
    Class feelings and revolutionary friendship cause Zavrazhin and Katya to develop love for each other during their short combat life. Although the director does not arrange many conversations between them, and there are very few scenes showing their love, it does not feel sudden, but rather intimate and moving. Because their love grows in battle, people believe that they will cherish their love. Here, of course, we should thank the young actors Savkin and Volochyonova for their portrayal of this lovely couple, and the director's concise expression.

　　看苏联影片“烽火的里程”
　　艾苗
    列车在原野上奔驰，车篷上、车厢里到处都塞满了人。车厢里有一位红军政委被白匪特务击伤了，生命垂危。他急于找到一个布尔什维克，去向城里司令部报告：反革命分子要在城里策划暴动。抢救政委的老医生谢拉柯教授，帮助他找到了保卫工作人员、布尔什维克扎甫拉金。政委谨慎地观察了他以后，告诉他：“敌人要在城里暴动，我们的司令部里有叛徒，他们在等信号，这个信号由一个化名维克多尔的人带到城里去。关于这个人我就知道这么一点。他还带着一个人，那个人打伤了我……你要亲自去，不能派别人！”扎甫拉金勇敢地承担起了这个艰巨的任务。
    苏联影片“烽火的里程”就这样展开了它的故事，把观众的注意同扎甫拉金的命运紧紧地接连在一起了。
    现在，谁先到达城里——是扎甫拉金还是白匪特务，成为最尖锐而有决定意义的斗争。可是扎甫拉金只能找到两辆马车去突破切断了道路的白匪，赶到城里去。还有急于要赶到城里去执行医疗任务的老医生和护士卡嘉，以及悲剧演员奥尔林斯基作了他的同路人。
    扎甫拉金需要一个机枪手。那个化名维克多尔的狡猾毒辣的白匪特务，却利用枪杀了他那行将暴露的同伙这一行动，骗取了保卫工作者的信任，充当了扎甫拉金的机枪手。特务的同行，使烽火的里程更添艰险了。
    果然第一夜歇宿后，维克多尔这只白狐狸利用扎甫拉金的偶然疏忽，杀死了年轻的驾车人，砍坏了马腿，骑着一匹马逃进城去了。于是，情况也就更紧急了。如果不能及时赶进城去，全城就将毁在白匪的暴动中。由于扎甫拉金善良的心感动了一个哑吧，他帮助他们找到了两匹马，他们得以重新上路。扎甫拉金既要急急赶路，又得抵御从四面八方追杀来的白匪，子弹在他们耳边呼哨，在他们胸前擦过。这是一场敌众我寡你死我活的斗争。驾车人和悲剧演员牺牲了，仁慈的老医生也受了伤！这时扎甫拉金唯一的伙伴——抑郁寡言的护士卡嘉，毫不迟疑地扬起了马鞭，驱车疾驰，协助扎甫拉金突出了白匪的重围，终于赶到城里，破获了敌人的阴谋，完成了政委临危时付托给他的重任。
    电影导演通过短促的烽火里程，描绘了十月革命后巩固和发展了苏维埃政权的英雄们，他们走过漫天烽火的国内战争的艰苦道路，创造着幸福的生活。
    导演以护士卡嘉在马车上注视扎甫拉金一双黑而粗壮的手，道出了布尔什维克扎甫拉金由一个为资本家流血流汗的矿工，成长为一个自觉的革命者。阶级本能和革命的锻炼，使善良质朴的扎甫拉金深深理解了保卫苏维埃政权的意义。对敌人是毫不容情的。为了完成党交给的任务，在敌我悬殊的危境中，他表现了无比的英勇，和卡嘉一道顽强地与敌人搏斗。
    对苏维埃敌人的仇恨，使得卡嘉成了最顽强的战士、扎甫拉金最勇敢忠实的驾车人，她奋不顾身协助孤军奋战的扎甫拉金冲出了敌人的枪林弹雨，完成了挽救全城罹难的光荣任务。
    阶级的感情、和革命的友谊，使扎甫拉金和卡嘉在短促的战斗生活里产生了爱情，导演虽然安排的他们的谈话并不多，表示爱情的场面也甚少，然而使人感到扎甫拉金这一对勇敢的人，在极短促的烽火途程中所产生的爱情不但不突然，而且亲切动人。因为他们的爱情是在战斗中成长起来的，人们相信他们会珍惜自己的爱情。这里当然应该感谢年轻演员萨甫金和伏罗琴诺娃对这一对可爱的人的塑造，和导演的简洁表现手法。
