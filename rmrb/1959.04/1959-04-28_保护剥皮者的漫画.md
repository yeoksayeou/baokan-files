    Cartoon Protecting the Flayers
    Hua Junwu
    The "People's Daily" on April 27 published two cartoons by Indian expansionists, with a very interesting title, "What kind of painting is this?!" I think any of us can answer this question.
    Both cartoons depict us as "barbarians." According to the meaning of the paintings, since we are "barbarians," then these gentlemen are of course "civilized people," and these gentlemen are of course fighting to defend "civilization." Unfortunately, right next to these two cartoons, there were several photos of the crimes of the Khampa rebel bandits instigated by the reactionary upper strata of Tibet: The photos show:
    Bowls made from the skulls of murdered people used by the Khampa rebel bandits.
    Various instruments of torture used by the Khampa rebel bandits, such as those for gouging eyes, cutting off noses and mouths, and severing tendons. Compared with these instruments of torture, the shackles and handcuffs in this photo seem "civilized" by comparison.
    A piece of human skin peeled from a Tibetan child, unbearable to look at.
    After seeing these photos, the obvious answer is clear. What is the content of the "civilization" that these Indian expansionists want to defend? If we are asked to answer "What kind of painting is this?!", it is a cartoon protecting the Khampa rebel bandits, instigated by the reactionary upper strata of Tibet, who murder, flay, gouge eyes, and sever tendons.
    The "free world" believes they have "freedom of creation." Presumably these few "cartoonists" are expressing this "freedom." However, in comparison with the photos, they have provided a good annotation of their "freedom" and "civilization." The only regret is that they were not able to take a photo of how the "cartoonists" looked after receiving pounds and rupees from their masters; but I think this is enough. People can already see the "civilized" faces of the "cartoonists" and their masters.

    保护剥皮者的漫画
    华君武
    4月27日“人民日报”刊登了两幅印度扩张主义分子的漫画，标题标得很有意思，“这是什么画？！”我想，我们谁都可以回答这个问题。
    两张漫画都把我们比作“野蛮人”，按照画的意思来看，我们既然是“野蛮人”那么这些先生们当然是“文明人”了，这些先生们当然是在为保卫“文明”而战的。可惜不巧的很，正在这两幅漫画旁边，就登了几张西藏上层反动集团指使的康巴叛乱分子的罪行的照片：照片上是：
    康巴叛乱分子用被杀害了的人的头骨做成的碗。
    康巴叛乱分子经常用的挖眼睛、割口鼻、抽脚筋用的各种刑具，在这张照片里的脚镣手铐和这些刑具比较起来，似乎已经显得“文明”得多了。
    一张使人不忍卒看的，从一个藏族孩子身上剥下来的人皮。
    看了这些照片，明显的答案就有了。这些印度扩张主义分子，他们所要保卫的“文明”是些什么内容。如果要我们回答“这是什么画？！”这就是要保护西藏上层反动集团指使的康巴叛乱分子杀人、剥皮、挖眼、抽筋的漫画。
    “自由世界”认为他们有着“创作自由”，想来这几个“漫画家”也就在表示了这种“自由”，但是在照片的对照之下，倒是把他们的“自由”、“文明”作了很好的注解；唯一遗憾的是，没有能够把这几个“漫画家”从他们的主子那里领到了英镑和卢比后的神气拍出照片来；但是我想这已经够了。人们从这里已经可以看出“漫画家”和他们主子的一副“文明”面孔。
