    Early Prevention and Control of the Three Harms of Wheat
    Anhui Takes Effective Measures to Prevent Wheat Diseases and Pests, Frost, and Lodging
    Pingliang Prefecture in Gansu Intensifies Frost and Hail Prevention to Ensure Wheat Safely Passes the Jointing Stage
    (Our Hefei Dispatch, April 3rd) While engaging in a major battle to ensure wheat jointing, the people of Anhui Province are also focusing on "three preventions," determined not to let a single wheat seedling be harmed, and to ensure a bumper wheat harvest this year.
    Currently, wheat in Anhui Province is growing vigorously, with most of it beginning to joint and prepare for heading. While diligently managing wheat seedlings, the busy crowds in the fields are actively preparing for various disasters such as diseases, pests, frost, and lodging, based on past experience. Disease and pest informants and scouts throughout the area are conducting thorough inspections in the heart of the fields. Anti-frost stoves are everywhere along the edges of fields. Most experimental and high-yield fields have been set up with neat racks to prevent lodging. Those listening to weather forecasts and the sky-watching teams are also working around the clock.
    Wheat diseases and pests have historically been relatively serious in Anhui Province, with wheat rust being the most harmful. For example, in Fuyang Prefecture in 1956, the area affected by wheat rust reached more than 7.8 million mu, resulting in a reduction of more than 200 million jin of wheat. Last year, wheat rust occurred extensively in various regions, but because preparations were made early and the masses were mobilized for timely prevention and control, an unprecedented bumper harvest was still achieved. This fact educated the masses about the importance of making early preparations for prevention and control this year. Especially since last winter, there has been little snowfall in various regions, and the climate has been warm, the occurrence of diseases and pests may be earlier than in previous years, so various regions have educated the masses to overcome complacency and continue to manufacture effective indigenous pesticides, lime, and sulfur mixtures, which were used in the past to prevent and eliminate wheat rust. According to statistics, the province has now used wild plants such as cat's-ear and red smartweed, as well as lime, to produce 24 million jin of indigenous pesticides. Of the 4,500 tons of sulfur supported by other provinces, more than 2,000 tons have been transferred. In addition, all communes and teams have established pest control headquarters, forecasting and reporting groups, and pesticide factories. The masses in Bo County put forward the slogan "Every team has an informant, every plot has a scout; wherever diseases and pests are discovered, eliminate them there," and nearly a hundred information points and nearly a thousand informants have been established throughout the county. When diseases and pests are discovered in individual places, forces are quickly organized to eliminate them in one fell swoop. In addition to generally overhauling the 1,593 sprayers and 1,572 powder sprayers from last year, Su County's farm implement factories are also actively rushing to produce 12,000 new pesticide application machines.
    Late frost is also a major enemy of wheat. In Anhui, cold waves often strike in early and mid-April, causing late frost. In April 1953, almost all wheat in the main wheat-producing areas of Huaibei suffered from frost damage. In Fuyang Prefecture alone, more than 9.39 million mu of wheat suffered a reduction of more than 40% due to late frost. Now is the threatening period of late frost, and according to past experience, various regions generally use methods such as watering, smoking, and adding random grass, ash, and manure to increase ground temperature and prevent frost damage. At the same time, various regions have also assigned special personnel to be responsible for listening to weather forecasts and closely watching climate changes. Some places also use methods such as chopping firewood for smoking, applying sufficient burnt soil manure to increase cold resistance, and weaving straw curtains and building windbreaks to prevent frost. Some places have built anti-frost stoves in the fields, and if there is insufficient fuel, they rush to make biogas coal. Fuyang Prefecture has prepared fuel and coverings such as mats and foils for frost prevention.
    Preventing wheat lodging is also the most prominent problem this year. Due to the sufficient application of base fertilizer, coupled with the widespread implementation of close planting, this year's crops are growing very luxuriantly, and a few fields are already showing a tendency to lodge. In addition to generally applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizers such as plant ash and wall soil to promote strong stalks, various regions are also carrying out soil cultivation and root strengthening in conjunction with hoeing and weeding. Various effective measures are also being taken for wheat seedlings that are about to lodge or may lodge. Liu'an Prefecture has adopted the method of deep ditching to lower the groundwater level in wheat fields and promote strong wheat stalks; for plots with excessive sowing, uneven sowing, and overly dense wheat seedlings, lean and weak seedlings are cut off, and old yellow leaves are removed to improve ventilation and light transmission conditions; for wheat seedlings that are about to lodge, measures such as setting up frames are taken to prevent lodging, all of which have achieved significant results. (Shi Zhengzhang, Chen Liyan)
    (Our Dispatch) The people of Pingliang Prefecture in Gansu Province have launched a wheat field management campaign to increase their efforts, measures, and yields. The people of the entire prefecture are building three lines of defense in the sky, on the ground, and underground to protect wheat from frost and hail, so that winter wheat can smoothly pass the jointing stage.
    Every year in April and May, Pingliang Prefecture has moist air coming from the southeast, which intersects with cold air coming from the northwest, causing hail disasters and severe frost damage. This is a major threat during the wheat jointing period. In 1957, 700,000 mu of wheat fields were replanted due to frost and hail damage. In 1958, it reached 400,000 mu, resulting in a loss of more than 200 million jin of wheat. According to weather station forecasts, the frost period may be earlier this year. The Pingliang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to prevent frost and hail by improving business management and strengthening technical measures. In terms of business management, they vigorously promote professional teams, wheat management archive system, and implement the "five determinations" and "five packages" responsibility system of determining land plots, determining yields, determining measures, determining leadership, determining labor, and county committee members contracting to communes, commune cadres contracting to teams, brigade cadres contracting to areas, production team cadres contracting to plots, and commune members contracting to mu, to achieve a systematic responsibility system where every road has a commander, every direction has a general, every plot has soldiers, and everyone is responsible. In terms of technical measures, first of all, make good use of the favorable conditions of the prefecture's realization of the meteorological network and broadcasting network, do a good job in forecasting and reporting, quickly transmit meteorological information, and at the same time mobilize the people of the entire prefecture to form three lines of defense from the sky, the ground to the underground to overcome frost and hail disasters. The first line of defense is aerial combat, generally establishing anti-frost furnace towers and artillery platforms, to ensure that every furnace has grass and every cannon has medicine. Once frost or hail arrives, the furnace smoke will fill the sky, and tens of thousands of cannons will fire in unison, increasing the air temperature and dispersing hail, eliminating and greatly weakening the destructive power of black frost and hail in the air; The second line of defense on the ground is to build frames, tie ropes, and weave straw curtains in the wheat fields. As soon as there is frost and hail information, cover the wheat seedlings with quilts so that the residual frost and broken hail after smoke and artillery strikes fall on the "quilts" without directly damaging the wheat seedlings; The third line of defense is topdressing and irrigation to increase the underground temperature and the disaster resistance of wheat seedlings, ensuring that wheat seedlings are not affected by sudden changes in temperature due to frost and hail.
    In the execution of the instructions of the prefectural committee on establishing and improving the responsibility system, the people's communes have all drawn lessons from the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, implemented the principle of distribution according to work, established a three-level responsibility system for communes, brigades, and production teams, and a four-fixed system for labor, land, draught animals, and farm implements, formulated labor quotas and attendance reward systems, and implemented work point evaluations, with fixed points and flexible evaluations. These measures have further stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the commune members. The communes and teams have held on-site meetings, debates, old farmer forums, and oath-taking rallies, mobilizing the masses to contribute ideas and suggestions, start early, set up more defenses, and skillfully apply fertilizer and water to prevent frost and hail and get through the jointing stage. Commune members in Pingliang City wrote 210,000 big-character posters and contributed 37,000 suggestions, and more than 8,900 old farmers in Ning County proposed 7,700 measures. The labor attendance rate and labor productivity have risen sharply. The attendance rate of Dangyuan Production Team of Yudu Commune in Jingchuan reached 99.8%, and production efficiency increased by 70%. Many places have begun to see high work efficiency movements of one person doing the work of two.
    The three lines of defense against frost and hail are being formed throughout the prefecture. According to statistics, more than 3 million anti-frost furnace towers have been built throughout the prefecture, and a large amount of smoke grass has been stored. The people of Ning County are launching a surge of "building furnaces on every plot and sewing quilts on every piece of land."
    At present, people are full of confidence, standing by, ready to meet the upcoming frost and hail, and ensure that wheat seedlings pass the jointing stage smoothly. (Liu Bang, Sun Min)

    及早防治小麦三害
    安徽采取有效措施防治小麦病虫、霜冻和倒伏
    甘肃平凉专区加紧防霜防雹保小麦稳渡拔节关
    本报合肥3日电　安徽省各地人民在大战小麦拔节关的同时，大抓“三防”工作，决心不让一棵麦苗受害，确保今年小麦大丰收。
    目前，安徽省各地小麦生长茁壮，大部分已开始拔节孕穗。田野里忙碌的人群，在继续精心管理麦苗的同时，根据往年的经验，又在积极为小麦不受病虫害、霜冻和倒伏等灾害赶作各种准备。遍布各地的病虫害情报员、侦察员、深入田心进行检查。田头地边到处是防霜炉灶。试验田、丰产田大部分已搭起整齐的架子，以防止倒伏。收听气象预报和看天小组的人们，也在夜以继日地紧张工作着。
    安徽省的小麦病虫害，历年来都较严重，其中尤以麦锈病危害最大。如阜阳专区1956年发生麦锈病的面积达七百八十多万亩，减产小麦两亿多斤。去年各地又普遍发生麦锈病，但由于准备得早，发动群众及时防治，仍获得空前丰收。事实教育群众，今年要及早作好防治工作。尤其是去冬以来，各地很少下雪，气候温暖，病虫害的发生可能比往年更早，所以各地都教育群众克服麻痹思想，继续制造过去防治和消灭麦锈病的有效土农药、石灰和硫磺合剂。据统计全省现在已用野生植物猫耳眼、红蓼草等及石灰制成土农药二千四百万斤。外省支援的四千五百吨硫磺，已调进二千多吨。此外，各社、队都建立灭虫指挥所、预测预报组、农药厂。亳县群众提出“队队有情报员，块块有侦察兵，哪里发现病虫害，就把它消灭在哪里”的口号，全县建立了近百个情报点，近千个情报员。个别地方发现病虫害，就很快组织力量，一举歼灭。宿县除将去年一千五百九十三部喷雾器和一千五百七十二部喷粉器普遍检修一次外，各农具厂还在积极赶制一万二千部新的药械。
    晚霜也是小麦的大敌，安徽历年4月上中旬常有寒潮袭击，发生晚霜。1953年4月份，淮北主要麦区几乎所有小麦都遭受了霜冻灾害，仅阜阳专区因受晚霜减产四成以上的小麦就有九百三十九万多亩。现在正进入晚霜冻威胁期，各地根据过去的经验，普遍采用浇水、熏烟和加盖乱草、灰土粪等办法，以提高地温、防止霜害。同时各地还确定专人负责，收听气象预报，密切注意气候变化。有些地方并采用砍柴熏烟，施足火烧土粪增加抗寒力，编草帘、搭防风障等办法，加以防止。有些地方田头砌防霜灶，燃料不足就赶制沼气煤。阜阳专区已准备好燃料及用于防霜的席、箔等复盖物。
    防止小麦倒伏也是今年最突出的问题。由于底肥施的足，加上普遍实行了密植，今年禾苗长得非常茂密，少数田已呈现出倾伏的趋势。各地除普施草木灰、墙土等磷钾肥料，促使秸秆健壮外，并结合中耕锄草进行培土壅根。对将要倒伏或可能倒伏的麦苗也采取各种有效措施。六安专区采取深挖沟办法，以降低麦田的地下水位，促使麦苗茎秆健壮；对下种过多、播种不匀、麦苗过稠的地块，剪掉瘦苗、弱苗，并摘除老黄叶，改善通风透光条件；对将要倒伏的麦苗，采取搭架子等办法，预防倒伏，均收到显著效果。　　　　　　（石正章、陈立言）
    本报讯　甘肃平凉专区人民，掀起了一个翻干劲、翻措施、翻产量的小麦田间管理运动。全区人民正在天空、地面、地下为小麦构筑三道防冻防冰雹的战线，使冬小麦顺利地度过拔节关。
    平凉专区每年4、5月间有从东南来的湿空气，与西北来的冷空气相交，造成雹灾和严重的霜害。这是小麦拔节期间的一大威胁。1957年因遭霜杀雹打而重新翻耕的麦田达七十万亩。1958年达四十万亩，损失小麦约两亿多斤。据气象站预报，今年霜期可能提前。中共平凉地委决定从改进经营管理和加强技术措施来防霜防雹。在经营管理方面，大力推广专业队、小麦管理档案制和推行定地块、定产量、定措施、定领导、定劳力及县委委员包社、社干包队、大队干部包片、生产队干部包块、社员包亩的“五定”、“五包”责任制，作到路路有帅，方方有将，块块有兵，人人负责的系统的责任制。在技术措施方面，首先利用全区实现气象网和广播网的有利条件，作好预测预报工作，迅速传递气象情况，同时动员全区人民从天空、地面到地下构成了三道防线战胜霜灾雹害。第一道防线是对空作战，普遍建立防霜炉塔和火炮台，作到炉炉有草，炮炮有药，一旦霜来雹至即炉烟弥天，万炮齐发，增高空中温度和击散冰雹，在空中就消灭和大大削弱黑霜与冰雹的杀伤力；第二道地面防线，在麦田里搭架、拴绳、编草帘，一有霜雹情报，就给麦苗盖上被子，使经过烟熏和炮打的残霜碎雹落在“被子”上面，不致直接伤损麦苗；第三道防线是追肥灌水，提高地下温度和麦苗的抗灾力，保证麦苗不因降霜落雹气温骤变而影响生长。
    各人民公社在执行地委建立与健全责任制的指示中，都吸取1958年大跃进的经验，贯彻按劳分配原则，建立了公社、大队、生产队三级责任制和劳力、土地、耕畜、农具四固定制度，制定了劳动定额和考勤奖励制度，实行评工记分，死分活评。这些措施进一步激发了社员的劳动积极性，各公社、队纷纷召开现场会、辩论会、老农座谈会和誓师大会，动员群众献计献策，早动手、多设防、巧施肥水，防霜防雹过好拔节关。平凉市各公社社员写大字报二十一万张，献计三万七千条，宁县八千九百多位老农提出措施七千七百多条。劳动出勤率和劳动生产率直线上升，泾川玉都公社党原生产队出勤率高达99.8％，生产效率提高70％。许多地方开始出现以一顶二的高工效运动。
    防霜防雹的三条防线正在全区构成。据统计全区已建起防霜炉塔三百多万个，并贮备了大量的熏烟草。宁县人民正在掀起一个“块块建炉，地地缝被”的热潮。
    目前，人们满怀信心，严阵以待，准备迎击即将来临的霜冻和雹害，保证麦苗平稳度过拔节关。
