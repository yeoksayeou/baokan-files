Visiting and Inscribing Poems
　　Ye Shengtao
　　
This trip out lasted twenty-five days, mainly to visit water conservancy projects in northern Jiangsu. The regulation of the Grand Canal, the opening of the Huai-Shu New River, and the arrangement of control gates and ship locks in various places—I often felt confused when people talked about them before, but now that I have seen them with my own eyes, I finally have a concrete impression. We visited three gates on the eastern shore of Hongze Lake. One is called the Erhe Gate, completed in June of last year. Lake water passes through this gate and flows into the Huai-Shu New River, which diverts the Huai River northward, connecting it with the Yi River in Shandong, allowing for mutual regulation. Another is called the Gaoliangjian Gate, which is currently under construction for expansion. Lake water passes through this gate and flows into the sea via the main irrigation canal. The third is called the Sanhe Gate, completed in July 1953, with sixty-three openings, spanning one-third of a kilometer. This gate regulates the water of Gaoyou and Baoying Lakes, connecting them to the Yangtze River. We visited two of the three control gates nearing completion in Yangzhuang, northwest of Huaiyin: the Huaiyin Gate and the Huailian Gate. The Huaiyin Gate spans the Huai-Shu New River. The Huailian Gate is right next to the Huaiyin Gate, diverting some water for irrigation. In Siyang County, we visited the underground culvert project on the Liutang River. The newly opened Huai-Shu New River generally runs north-south, with a relatively high water level. Therefore, the east-west Huai-Si River and Bao River must pass under the Huai-Shu New River, and the only way to do this is to build culverts. This culvert has twelve openings side by side, each three meters four square, with an inlet and outlet 500 meters apart. In Shuyang, we visited the Shuyang Gate construction project. The Shuyang Gate also spans the Huai-Shu New River. There are also underground culverts under the gate for the water of the Chaimi River to pass through. This culvert has twenty-two openings side by side, each three meters square, with an inlet and outlet 357 meters apart. We arrived at just the right time to see the internal structure of these two underground culverts. Soon the culverts will be completed and permanently buried underground, with only the inlets and outlets visible. As for the regulation project of the Grand Canal, a new channel has been completed from Jieshou to Gaoyou, allowing passage for 2,000-ton ships. Currently under construction are the sections north of Jieshou and south of Gaoyou, totaling 37 kilometers. A total of 160,000 laborers have been mobilized. The project involves moving the western embankment of the canal westward and building it particularly strong to withstand the strong winds and waves on the lake. In Shaobo, we visited the construction project of the No. 1 ship lock. Shaobo originally had a ship lock, but it was too small to meet the current development needs, so a larger one needs to be built. This No. 1 ship lock is 20 meters wide at the bottom and 250 meters long, with electric opening and closing, which can be opened once every ten minutes. In the future, No. 2 and No. 3 ship locks will also be built. West of the three ship locks, a large control gate will be built, 1,078 meters long, with 135 openings, each 6 meters wide. The function of this large control gate is to discharge floodwater and store water. When water needs to be stored, it will be stored in Gaoyou Lake and Shaobo Lake. The origin and course of the waterways, the regulation and adjustment of the sluice gates, and the comprehensive utilization of water flow are difficult to describe clearly in words, making it seem as if one has witnessed it personally. Therefore, we suggest that a large-scale documentary film be made of the entire water conservancy project in northern Jiangsu. The film should include animated diagrams, images of the gradual completion of various buildings, and the great scenes of mass collective labor. Such a documentary film will have permanent educational significance. Perhaps several films can be made from different perspectives, not just one.

　　During this visit, some units asked us to leave inscriptions as a souvenir. Now, I will transcribe a few poems that were inscribed below. Although they are just fragments, one can imagine the new atmosphere in various places.

　　参观和题赠

    这一回出门二十五天，主要是参观苏北的水利工程。大运河的整治，淮沭新河的开拓，各处节制闸和船闸的布置，以前听人谈及往往感觉搞不清楚，现在亲眼看见，总算有了个具体的印象。我们看了洪泽湖东岸的三个闸。一个叫二河闸，去年6月间修成。湖水通过这个闸，流入淮沭新河，这就使淮河北调，跟山东的沂河相通，可以互相调剂。又一个叫高良涧闸，现在正在动工扩建。湖水通过这个闸，流经灌溉总渠入海。第三个叫三河闸，1953年7月间修成，六十三孔，长三分之一公里。这个闸调节高、宝诸湖的水，通到大江。我们在淮阴西北的杨庄，看了即将完工的三个节制闸中的两个，淮阴闸和淮涟闸。淮阴闸跨在淮沭新河上。淮涟闸就在淮阴闸旁边，分一部分水供给灌溉。在泗阳县境，我们看了六塘河地下涵洞工程。新开的淮沭新河大体上是南北方向，水位比较高，因此，东西方向的淮泗河和包河势必在淮沭新河底下通过，这惟有修建涵洞一法。这个涵洞并排十二孔，每孔三公尺四见方，进出口相距五百公尺。在沭阳，我们看了沭阳闸的修建工程。沭阳闸也跨在淮沭新河上。闸下又有地下涵洞，通过柴米河的水。这个涵洞并排二十二孔，每孔三公尺见方，进出口相距三百五十七公尺。我们去得正巧，看见了这两个地下涵洞的内部构造，不久涵洞就将完工，一完工就永远埋在地下，只能看见进出口了。再说大运河的整治工程。从界首到高邮，已经修成新河道，可以通行二千吨的船只。目前施工的，是界首以北一段和高邮以南一段，共计三十七公里。发动民工共十六万人。工程是把运河的西堤西移，修筑得特别牢固，使能抵御湖上的大风浪。在邵伯，我们看了一号船闸的修建工程。邵伯原来有个船闸，很小，不能适应当前的发展情况，所以需要修建大的。这个一号船闸底宽二十公尺，长二百五十公尺，电力启闭，十分钟就可以开一次。今后还将修建二号三号船闸，在三个船闸的西边，将修建一个大控制闸，长一千零七十八公尺，一百三十五孔，每孔宽六公尺。这个大控制闸的作用是排洪蓄水，需要蓄水的时候，把水蓄在高邮湖和邵伯湖里。水道的来龙去脉、水闸的节制调剂和水流的综合利用的情形，语言文字很难叙述得一清二楚，叫人宛同目睹。因此，我们建议把苏北整个水利工程摄制一部大型记录片，片中有活动的示意图，有各项建筑物逐步完成的形象，也有群众集体劳动的伟大场面，这样的记录片将会有永久的教育意义。也许还可以从不同的角度摄制好几部，不仅一部而已。
    这一回出去参观，有些单位要我们留题作纪念。现在把题赠的几首诗抄在下边，虽然是一鳞一爪，也可以从而想见各地的新气象。
