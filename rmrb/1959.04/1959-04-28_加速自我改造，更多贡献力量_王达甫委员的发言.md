Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members:

After listening to Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian's reports on the 1959 National Economic Plan, the 1958 final accounts, and the 1959 draft budget, as well as Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the CPPCC, I have a clearer understanding of the great achievements of our country's First Five-Year Plan and the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan – 1958, and the grand scale of the 1959 national economic development. This makes me feel extraordinarily excited and encouraged. I express my warm support for these reports and am determined to contribute all my wisdom and strength to better play the role of my little screw to realize this magnificent national economic development plan. At the same time, I firmly support all the measures proposed by Premier Zhou in the Government Work Report regarding the suppression of the rebellion in Tibet. I am a scientific and technological worker engaged in the textile industry, and I am prepared to express some of my superficial views on how to further and better exert the role of scientific and technological workers in the greater leap forward of industrial and agricultural production in the future. I would like to ask the committee members to give me their corrections. In the latter part of the third section of his report, Premier Zhou talked about the transformation of old intellectuals. After making a correct assessment of the progress of old intellectuals, he proposed: "All old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-transformation in the long-term practice of work in the future." In order to live up to Premier Zhou's very sincere and earnest expectations for us (old intellectual comrades), I believe we should work hard in the following aspects:

	1. Recognize the situation, be determined, further break with the bourgeois worldview, constantly transform ourselves, gradually master the worldview of the working class, and realize a fundamental self-transformation. Only by constantly carrying out self-socialist revolution on our old ideology, old viewpoints, and positions, and unremittingly and repeatedly engaging in a relentless and irreconcilable struggle against these old things, can we gradually achieve the victory of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology." Because before the revolution of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" on the ideological front has achieved a complete victory, often after an ideological revolution movement, we think that accepting the leadership of the Party and taking the socialist road is no problem, and that we have basically reached the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao, but when a new movement comes, we cannot withstand the impact and test of the continuous revolutionary tide, and the bourgeois ideological tail is exposed again. After the rectification and anti-rightist movement, some old intellectuals believed that they had actively participated in the struggle against the rightists and had become "leftists," and that there was no problem with their position, but in the steel battle in the second half of 1958, they felt nervous about their work and life, and generated some complaints, and in the movement to vigorously develop people's communes, they had some inappropriate resistance and wrong views on collective life. Although these thoughts, emotions and views were quickly clarified and eliminated, they are sufficient to fully illustrate the repetitive nature of our bourgeois intellectuals in the long journey of self-transformation. We must recognize that our motherland will soon realize socialist industrialization, and will soon enter the great era of transition from socialism to communism. If we do not get rid of our old ideological baggage, we may be abandoned by the constantly advancing wheels of the times at any time. If we do not recognize the situation and are determined to transform ourselves, carry out unremitting self-revolution with the spirit of continuous revolution, and strive to achieve a complete victory in "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology," it will be difficult for us to maintain a full and happy mood in our work in the wave after wave of revolutionary movements, and in the wave after wave of production leap forward climax. Of course, we will not be able to wholeheartedly serve socialism! Because if the remnants of bourgeois individualism in thought are not completely eradicated, we will inevitably worry about gains and losses and be afraid of taking risks in our work. If we cannot get rid of the shackles of individualism, our thinking cannot be liberated, and the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act cannot be established. In this way, it will be difficult to give full play to our due role in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

	2. Sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, frequently report our ideological situation to the Party organization, actively strive for the help of the Party, deeply study the Party's policies and guidelines, and honestly listen to the Party's words; closely contact the masses, put down airs, and humbly learn from the workers and peasants is the most reliable guarantee for improving ourselves, enriching ourselves, constantly transforming ourselves, and doing a good job in our posts. Chairman Shaoqi said that of the thousands of articles, the leadership of the Party is the first, and of the thousands of plans, the mass line is the first. These two short sentences point out the clear direction for us to transform ourselves and do our work well. The brilliant achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 were mainly due to the fact that the people of the whole country were inspired by the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and followed the policy of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward. Taking Shijiazhuang City, where I serve, as an example, it did not produce even a pound of iron in the past, but in the steel battle in the fourth quarter of 1958, after the first secretary took command and fully mobilized the masses, they overcame numerous difficulties and overfulfilled the 110,000-ton iron-smelting task assigned by the higher authorities. The ten or so textile enterprises in Shijiazhuang City also relied on the leadership of the Party Committee, mobilized all 30,000 or so employees, and in the fourth quarter of 1958, on the one hand, they withdrew one-third of the workforce to complete the task of producing 10,500 tons of iron assigned by the Municipal Party Committee; at the same time, with the revolutionary spirit of one person doing the work of two, they also overfulfilled the state plan for cotton yarn and cotton cloth. Through the steel battle, employees ate, lived, and worked together, which closely linked the relationship between cadres and the masses. The work style of engineering and technical personnel has also changed, and they have tempered their thinking and improved their socialist consciousness, achieving a great harvest in three aspects: steel production, yarn and cloth production, and ideological style. In addition, our scientific and technological workers must resolutely abandon the bourgeois academic ideology of separating from production, separating from reality, and separating from the masses for the sake of academic research from the standpoint of individualism. We must establish an academic ideology that serves production and proceeds from the current and long-term interests of socialism. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report that "the task of directly serving production and construction should be placed in the primary position. Attention must also be paid to the development of cutting-edge science and technology. Sufficient attention must be given to the research of basic theory." This is the correct direction for our scientific and technological workers to vigorously carry out technological revolution and scientific research. In the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production in 1958, the textile industry in our country basically realized the high-speed operation of machinery in the second half of the year, which increased the output of cotton yarn in 1958 by 31% compared with 1957. The speed of spinning machines climbed to the peak of the world. Hundreds of thousands of textile workers across the country broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and combined their soaring energy with scientific analysis in the high-speed operation of machinery. They put forward thousands of technical innovation and technical revolution proposals, solved many difficulties and problems, and have initially gained considerable experience in the high-speed operation of textile machinery, laying a good foundation for achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the textile industry in 1959. The achievements are huge, but there are still many issues such as lower product quality and higher material consumption that need to be further studied and resolved. The task of our textile scientific and technological workers is to launch academic research activities to thoroughly and rationally solve these problems, pave the way for the realization of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, and strive to further improve labor productivity, increase production and practice economy, oppose waste, greatly reduce the rate of defective products, and completely eliminate the rate of waste products.

	3. Seriously studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao Zedong's works, actively participating in production labor and exercise, and taking more time to walk out of the office, go to the factory and the countryside, and learn from the workers and peasants to cultivate class feelings with the working people is the correct way to gradually break with the bourgeois worldview and gradually master the working class worldview. It is an effective measure to get rid of the stinky baggage of "three styles" and "five airs" that we brought from the old society as soon as possible. Our scientific and technological workers who directly participate in production must also deeply understand and learn to use the working methods of the mass line of "one exchange, four greats, two participations, and three combinations." I realize that this is an effective measure to rely on the masses, closely contact the masses, promptly learn from the masses, more deeply understand the specific actual situation of production, so as to more quickly and effectively solve key production problems and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of production tasks. There are many successful examples in this regard in various places and industrial departments, so I will not list them again.

The above are a few superficial understandings and experiences of the transformation of old intellectuals after studying Premier Zhou's report. If there is anything inappropriate, please correct me. Finally, I wish the conference a success, and all the members good health!

### 加速自我改造，更多贡献力量  王达甫委员的发言

    加速自我改造，更多贡献力量
    王达甫委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我听了周总理的政府工作报告，李富春和李先念两位副总理的关于一九五九年国民经济计划、一九五八年的决算和一九五九年的预算草案的报告与李维汉副主席有关政协工作的报告以后，更清楚地了解到我国第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划第一年——一九五八年的伟大成就以及一九五九年发展国民经济的宏伟规模。这使我感觉到异常的振奋和鼓舞。我表示热烈拥护这些报告，并坚决为实现这个宏伟的国民经济发展计划更好地发挥我这个小螺丝钉的作用而贡献出我的一切智慧和力量。我同时坚决拥护总理在政府工作报告中提出的关于平定西藏叛乱的一切措施。我是从事纺织工业的一个科技工作者，我准备对于如何在今后工农业生产更大的跃进中进一步更好地发挥科技工作者的作用问题发表一些浅见，请各位委员予以指正。周总理在报告的第三部分后段谈到了有关旧知识分子的改造问题，在对旧知识分子的进步做了正确的估计以后，提出：“一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造。”为了不辜负总理对我们（旧知识分子同志们）这个非常诚恳而又殷切的期待，我认为应从以下几个方面努力：
    1．认清形势，下定决心，进一步同资产阶级的世界观决裂，不断地改造自己，逐步地掌握起工人阶级的世界观，实现脱胎换骨的根本性自我改造。只有能够对自己的旧思想意识、旧观点和立场不断地进行自我的社会主义革命，坚持不懈地反复地向这些旧东西做无情的不调和的斗争，才能逐步取得“兴无灭资”的胜利。因为在立场上的“兴无灭资”的革命未获得彻底胜利以前，往往在经过一个思想革命的运动以后，自己以为接受党的领导走社会主义道路无问题了，基本上能达到毛主席提出的六项政治标准了，但遇到一个新的运动一来，自己又经不起不断革命的浪潮的冲击和考验，资产阶级的思想尾巴又暴露了出来。在整风反右以后有些旧知识分子认为自己积极参加了反击右派的斗争，已成了“左派”了，立场没有问题了，但在一九五八年下半年钢铁大战中，又感觉工作生活紧张，产生了某些埋怨情绪，在大搞人民公社运动中对集体生活又发生了一些不应有的抵触情绪和错误的看法。这些思想情绪和看法虽很快得到了澄清和消除，但已足以充分说明我们资产阶级知识分子在漫长的自我改造途程中的反复性。必须认清祖国很快即将实现社会主义工业化，而且即将进入由社会主义向共产主义过渡的伟大时代，我们的旧思想包袱不丢掉就有可能随时为不断前进的时代巨轮所抛弃。如不认清形势下定决心改造自己，以不断革命的精神进行坚持不懈地自我革命，力求取得“兴无灭资”的彻底胜利，在一浪跟一浪的革命运动中，在一浪高一浪生产跃进高潮中，自己是很难在工作中经常保持着饱满愉快的情绪的，当然也就谈不到全心全意地为社会主义服务喽！因为在思想上资产阶级个人主义的残余得不到彻底肃清，在工作中就必然会患得患失畏首畏尾。摆脱不了个人主义的枷锁，思想就不能解放，敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格就树立不起来。这样，在工农业生产大跃进中也就很难发挥出自己的应有的作用。
    2．真诚接受党的领导，经常向党组织汇报自己的思想情况，主动地争取党的帮助，深入学习党的方针和政策，老老实实地听党的话；密切联系群众，放下架子，虚心向工农群众学习是提高自己充实自己、不断改造自己、做好岗位工作的最可靠的保证。少奇委员长说过千条万条党的领导是第一条，千计万计群众路线是第一计。短短的两句话指出了我们改造自己，做好工作的明确方向。一九五八年大跃进的光辉成绩的取得主要由于全国人民受了党的鼓足干劲力争上游多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞和遵行了以钢为纲全面跃进的方针。以我服务所在地的石家庄市来说，过去一斤铁也不生产，但在一九五八年第四季的钢铁大战中，由于第一书记挂帅，全面发动了群众以后，克服了重重困难，超额完成了上级分配的十一万吨炼铁任务。石家庄市的十来个纺织企业也依靠了党委的领导，动员了全体三万左右的职工，在一九五八年第四季一方面抽出了三分之一的人力完成了市委分配的生产一万零五百吨铁的任务；同时以一个人顶两个人的革命干劲也超额完成棉纱棉布的国家计划。通过钢铁大战，职工同吃同住同劳动，密切了干群关系，工程技术人员的作风也转变了，锻炼了思想，提高了社会主义觉悟，做到钢铁生产、纱布生产、思想作风三方面的大丰收。此外我们科技工作者还必须坚决摈弃从个人主义出发的脱离生产、脱离实际、脱离群众的为学术而学术的资产阶级学术思想，必须树立为生产服务、从社会主义的当前利益和长远利益出发的学术思想。周总理在报告中提出“直接为生产建设服务的任务，应当放在首要的地位。尖端科学技术也必须注意发展。基础理论的研究必须给以足够的重视的指示。这是我们科技工作者大搞技术革命，大搞科学研究的正确方向。在一九五八年的工农业生产大跃进中，我国的纺织工业在下半年基本上全面实现了机械运转高速化，使一九五八年的棉纱产量比一九五七年增加了百分之三十一。纱机的速度攀登了世界的高峰。全国数十万纺织职工在机械高速化运转中破除了迷信，解放了思想，冲天的干劲结合了科学的分析，苦干加上了巧干，提出了成千成万的技术革新和技术革命的建议，解决了很多困难和问题，已初步取得了纺织机械高速化运转的相当丰富的经验，为在一九五九年实现纺织工业的更大更好更全面的跃进奠定了良好的基础。成绩是巨大的，但也还存在着产品质量较低和物料消耗较大等许许多多的课题，有待进一步研究解决。我们纺织科技工作者的任务就是针对这些课题展开学术研究活动来加以彻底、合理地解决，为实现一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进铺平道路，为进一步提高劳动生产率，增加生产厉行节约，反对浪费大力降低次品率和彻底消灭废品率而努力奋斗。
    3、认真学习马列主义和毛泽东主席的著作，积极参加生产劳动锻炼，拿出更多的时间来走出办公室，下厂下乡，向工农群众学习，培养起与劳动人民的阶级情感是逐步同资产阶级世界观决裂，逐步掌握起工人阶级世界观的正确途径，是尽快地丢掉我们由旧社会带来的“三风”和“五气”的臭包袱的有效措施。我们直接参加生产的科技工作者还必须深入领会并学会运用“一交、四大、两参、三结合”的群众路线的工作方法。我体会这是依靠群众，密切联系群众，及时向群众学习，更深入地了解具体的生产实际情况，从而能更迅速有效地解决生产关键问题保证完成和超额完成生产任务的行之有效的措施。各地各产业部门中有关这方面的成功范列很多，不再例举。
    以上是学习了总理的报告以后对于有关旧知识分子的改造问题的几点肤浅认识和体会，不当之处，请各委员指正。最后祝大会胜利，各位委员同志们身体健康！
