    Comrade Zeng Shan, Minister of the Communications Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, at a wired broadcast conference held by the Ministry of Railways on the 30th, called on the staff and workers of the national railway system to launch a new upsurge in the mass movement to ensure the completion of this year's greater transportation tasks on the railways.

    In his speech, Zeng Shan pointed out that under the illumination of the General Line, railway transportation work in 1958 achieved brilliant results. The freight volume completed was 380 million tons; more than 2,300 kilometers of new and restored railways were built; and the efficiency of surveying and design was increased by one to several times compared with the past. The manufacture of locomotives and rolling stock was not only much greater than in previous years, but also the trial production of internal combustion locomotives and electric locomotives was successful. These achievements are unprecedented in the history of China's railways.

    Zeng Shan said that 1959 is a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. The Party Central Committee has put forward a magnificent economic plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, which has brought glorious and arduous tasks to our transportation. In terms of railways, the freight volume this year is much greater than last year. Under the current situation of insufficient transportation capacity, to complete such a heavy task, it is required that the staff and workers of all aspects of the railway system work together, exert greater effort, and overcome the difficulties in our progress. Comrades in the transportation departments should strive to complete and overfulfill the tasks of loading and unloading vehicles, and do everything possible to accelerate the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock and improve transportation efficiency. Comrades in the factories should work hard to produce and manufacture new locomotives and rolling stock as soon as possible. Comrades in the engineering departments should speed up the construction speed so that new projects can be put into production as soon as possible. Comrades in the design departments should speed up design, improve quality, and meet the needs of construction. Recently, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have issued a notice on convening a conference of advanced collectives and advanced producers in socialist construction. Party committees at all levels of enterprises should, under the leadership of local party committees, actively organize and lead the broad masses of staff and workers to carry out a massive labor competition movement to learn from and catch up with the advanced.

    When talking about how to complete this year's production and transportation tasks, Comrade Zeng Shan focused on the following three issues:

    1.  Continue to carry out the mass movement centered on technological revolution and aimed at improving labor efficiency. Last year, the technological revolution and technological innovation movement in the railway system achieved great results. The inventions and creations of staff and workers can be said to be blooming in a hundred flowers and full of vibrant colors, which have played a very good role in improving transportation efficiency and reducing physical labor. I recently went to the Huangtujing Station of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau and saw that they used high platforms, low cargo positions, and automatic coal unloading hoppers. It only takes one or two minutes to load a truck of 30 tons of coal, which increases efficiency by 150 to 300 times. Coal transportation accounts for about 40% of the total railway transportation volume. If all parts of the country adopt this method, the loading and unloading time can be greatly shortened and the vehicle turnover can be accelerated. Although the equipment has also increased greatly this year, it is still insufficient, and the labor force is tight. Therefore, we must continue to engage in technological revolution and technological innovation on a large scale.

    Zeng Shan pointed out that the current technological revolution and technological innovation movement should continue to vigorously mobilize the masses, adopt the "three-combination" method, concentrate efforts to solve the key problems in enterprise production, and at the same time, systematically promote the effective inventions and creations that have already emerged. Each enterprise should, according to the urgent needs of production and the requirements of gradually eliminating heavy physical labor and realizing mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, formulate a plan for technological revolution so that the technological revolution can be advanced in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    2.  Further strengthen cooperation within and outside railway enterprises. After the rectification movement, thanks to the communist spirit of cadres and workers, the cooperative relationship between various departments within our railways and between railways and various relevant parties has been greatly strengthened. Not only have we achieved mutual exchange of information, mutual exchange of needs, mutual care, and mutual support, but also many stations and industrial and mining enterprises have implemented unified leadership in many tasks. Due to the strengthening of cooperation, new forces have been generated, the stay time of vehicles has been shortened, and the turnover of vehicles has been accelerated. The Fuxin Station adopted the "Ten Unifications" method, which shortened the railway transportation operation time from more than 14 hours to 7 or 8 hours, and the most was once shortened to 4 hours and 12 minutes. From this, it can be seen that further strengthening cooperation with all parties is a very important aspect of ensuring the completion of this year's transportation tasks, especially strengthening cooperation with industrial and mining enterprises is of great significance. Cooperation is not only an important measure to solve the current transportation tension, but also one of the basic characteristics of socialist production relations. Every comrade should firmly establish the idea of cooperation, and should actively study some issues in mutual relations with various relevant departments, and earnestly do a good job in cooperative relations, so that the work of production and transportation can move forward side by side.

    3.  We must do our work more meticulously and solidly. This year's transportation task is more arduous, and the work puts forward higher requirements for us. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party requires us to exert greater effort and do our work more meticulously and solidly, so that the work plan is built on a solid and reliable basis. We should, in accordance with this spirit, through down-to-earth work, steadily increase our production level, and not only greatly increase the quantity, but also have better quality. Since February, our various indicators have not only improved, but also developed in a relatively balanced manner, the transportation order is good, and accidents have also decreased. For example, the Hailar Bureau once achieved the results of "Four Hundreds and One Zero" (that is, 100% of passenger trains depart on time, 100% arrive on time; 100% of freight trains depart on time, 100% arrive on time; no major accidents and major accidents). This shows that the level of our enterprise work has made new progress on the basis of last year. We should summarize this experience well, continue to develop it, and better complete this year's production and transportation tasks.

    Finally, Zeng Shan hopes that the national railway staff and workers will enthusiastically respond to the call of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, everyone will strive to be advanced, everyone will strive to be a model, and give greater and better results to the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers, and strive for more advanced representatives on the railway front to come to Beijing to participate in this grand meeting.

    鼓起更大干劲　提高运输效率
    曾山同志在全国铁路职工竞赛广播大会上的讲话（摘要）
    新华社31日讯　中共中央交通工作部部长曾山在30日铁道部举行的有线广播大会上，号召全国铁路系统职工掀起群众运动的新高潮，保证完成今年铁路上更大的运输任务。
    曾山在讲话中指出：1958年铁路运输工作在总路线的照耀下，取得了辉煌的成绩，货运量完成了三亿八千万吨；新建铁路和修复铁路二千三百多公里；勘测设计的工效比过去提高了一倍到几倍；机车车辆制造不但比往年多得多，还试制成功了内燃机车、电气机车。这些成绩在我国铁路史上是空前未有的。
    曾山说：1959年是更大更好更全面跃进的一年，党中央提出以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的宏伟的经济计划，给我们交通运输带来了光荣而艰巨的任务。在铁路方面，今年货运量比去年大得多。在目前运力不足的情况下，要完成这样繁重的任务，就要求铁路系统各个方面的职工同志共同努力，拿出更大的干劲，来战胜我们前进中的困难。运输部门的同志们，应当努力完成和超额完成装车卸车任务，千方百计地加速机车、车辆周转，提高运输效率；工厂的同志们，应当努力生产，尽快地把新的机车车辆制造出来；工程部门的同志们，应当加快施工速度，使新建工程能够尽快投入生产；设计部门的同志，应当加速设计，提高质量，满足施工的需要。最近中共中央和国务院已经发出了关于召开社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表会议的通知，各级企业党委应当在地方党委的领导下，积极地组织和领导广大职工群众，开展一个声势浩大的学先进、赶先进的劳动竞赛运动。
    曾山同志在讲到怎样完成今年的生产、运输任务时，着重谈了以下三个问题：
    一、继续开展以技术革命为中心、以提高劳动效率为目的的群众运动。去年在铁路系统中，技术革命和技术革新运动，取得了很大成绩，职工的发明创造，可以说是百花齐放，万紫千红，这对于提高运输效率，减轻体力劳动，都起了很好的作用。我最近到柳州铁路局黄土井车站，看到他们采用高站台、低货位和自动装煤翻斗，装一车三十吨煤只需一、两分钟时间，提高效率一百五十到三百倍。煤炭运输占铁路总运量的40％左右，如果全国各地都采取这种办法，就能大大缩短装卸时间，加速车辆周转。今年的货运比去年大大增加，虽然设备也有很大增加，但还是很不足，加以目前劳动力紧张，因此必须继续大搞技术革命和技术革新。
  曾山指出：当前的技术革命和技术革新运动，应当继续大力发动群众，采取三结合办法，集中力量解决企业生产上的关键问题，同时要对已经出现的行之有效的发明创造，有计划地加以推广。各企业应当根据生产的迫切需要和逐步消灭笨重体力劳动、实现机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化的要求，订出技术革命的规划，使技术革命有计划有步骤地向前推进。
    二、进一步加强铁路企业内外的协作。经过整风运动，由于干部和职工同志发扬了共产主义风格，我们铁路内部各部门之间和铁路与各有关方面之间的协作关系大大加强了，不但作到了互通情报，互通有无，互相照顾，互相支援，而且有许多车站和厂矿企业在许多工作上实行统一领导。由于加强协作，就产生了新的力量，缩短了车辆的停留时间，加速了车辆的周转。阜新车站采取“十统”办法的结果，使铁路运输一次作业时间，由原来的十四小时以上，缩短到七、八小时，最多的曾经缩短到四小时十二分钟。由此可见，进一步加强与各方面的协作，是保证完成今年运输任务的一个非常重要的方面，尤其是加强与厂矿企业的协作更有重要意义。协作不但是解决当前运输紧张的一个重要的措施，而且是社会主义生产关系的基本特征之一。我们每个同志都应当牢固地树立起协作思想，并且要主动地与各有关部门研究相互关系中的一些问题，切实搞好协作关系，使生产、运输两方面的工作并肩前进。
    三、要把我们的工作做得更细致、更扎实。今年的运输任务更加繁重了，工作对我们提出了更高的要求。党的八届六中全会要求我们拿出更大的干劲，并且把工作做得更细致、更扎实，使工作计划建筑在切实可靠的基础上。我们应当根据这个精神，经过踏踏实实的工作，使我们的生产水平稳步上升，不但要大大增加数量，而且要有更好的质量。2月份以来，我们的各项指标不但有了新的提高，而且发展比较平衡，运输秩序良好，事故也有所减少。如海拉尔局曾经达到“四百一无”的成绩（即客车100％的正点出发，100％的正点到达；货车100％的正点出发，100％的正点到达；没有一件大事故和重大事故）。这说明我们企业的工作水平在去年基础上有了新的进步。我们应当很好总结这个经验，继续使它发展下去，更好地完成今年生产运输任务。
    最后，曾山希望全国铁路职工热烈响应中共中央和国务院的号召，人人争取当先进，个个争取当模范，拿出更大更好的成绩，献给全国先进集体和先进生产者代表会议，并且争取铁道战线上有更多的先进代表到北京来参加这个盛大的会议。
