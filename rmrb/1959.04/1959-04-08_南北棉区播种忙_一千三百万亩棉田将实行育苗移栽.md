Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: Cotton sowing is rapidly unfolding from south to north. In the southern cotton regions of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, sowing has already begun. The Yangtze River basin has also started, with about 20% of the cotton fields in the riverside and lakeside areas of Anhui Province already sown. After the completion of cotton trial sowing in the Yellow River basin, it will soon enter the stage of full-scale sowing. In the northern regions of Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces, as well as Liaoning Province in the Northeast, cotton sowing will also begin soon.

In order to lay the foundation for achieving the cotton production target of 100 million dan this year, all regions are paying close attention to the quality of sowing. Shaanxi Province has formulated eight technical measures to ensure sowing quality, including timely early sowing, rational close planting, eliminating large furrow sowing, and implementing strip sowing, which are being promoted throughout the province. In order to ensure that cotton seedlings emerge all at once and achieve full and vigorous seedlings, various places in Shandong are actively promoting the yield-increasing measure of timely sowing and single sowing. Gaotang County has launched a vigorous competition for this purpose.

Seedling transplantation is a successful experience in promoting early maturity and high yield of cotton. This year, not only are the double-cropping cotton areas in the south extensively promoting this experience, but the single-cropping cotton areas in the north are also actively promoting it. According to preliminary estimates, the national cotton fields for seedling transplantation this year can reach about 13 million mu. In the old cotton region of Zhejiang, cotton fields using nutrient pot seedling transplantation will account for 80% of the cotton field area. Early-cultivated cotton seedlings in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, have already begun to be transplanted. In the Shijiazhuang Special Zone of Hebei, cotton seedlings cultivated in warm beds by many people's communes have emerged one after another, which will develop nearly a month earlier than cotton directly sown in the fields.

This year, all regions have great enthusiasm for achieving large-scale high yields of cotton. Hebei, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, and other places have separately designated about 20% of the cotton fields as large-scale high-yield fields. The large-scale high-yield cotton fields in Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and other places will reach 30% to 50% respectively. On large-scale high-yield fields, garden-style cultivation is being vigorously carried out. In Shaanxi, one million mu of large-scale high-yield cotton fields have initially met the requirements of garden-style cultivation in terms of land preparation and irrigation and drainage facilities. In the Shijiazhuang Special Zone of Hebei, 1.3 million mu of high-yield cotton fields have achieved garden-style cultivation.

This year, many regions have expanded the cotton planting area, and many new cotton regions have emerged. All regions have strengthened leadership over these new cotton regions and provided technical and material support. In the new cotton regions of Anhui, the secretaries of Party committees at all levels are in charge of leading cotton production. In the newly expanded cotton region of Zhejiang, 600-person cotton planting technology training classes have been opened, and more than 200 skilled cotton planters have been transferred from the old cotton region to the new cotton region to serve as cotton planting technology instructors. Guangdong has also hired dozens of cotton planting technology instructors from the Hubei region to help the new cotton region.

This year, the preparation for cotton fields in various regions is good. The depth of cotton field plowing generally reaches seven inches to one foot, and even the shallow ones are more than five inches; cotton fields with a deep plowing of more than one foot account for a quarter to half of the cotton field area in each province. In terms of applying base fertilizer, according to a survey of 5.87 million mu of cotton fields in 43 counties in Shandong Province, more than 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu accounts for 80%, which is much more than last year. The area of cotton fields with winter irrigation and spring irrigation has also expanded. According to statistics from Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces, about 55% of the cotton fields in the four provinces have undergone winter and spring irrigation, which is one and a half times larger than last year. Before sowing, all regions also launched large-scale land preparation and moisture conservation work. Thanks to good harrowing and raking, the soil moisture in cotton fields in most areas is good, providing conditions for timely early sowing and full and vigorous seedlings.

    南北棉区播种忙
    一千三百万亩棉田将实行育苗移栽
    新华社7日讯　棉花播种工作正在由南向北迅速展开。南方云南、贵州、四川、广东、广西等地棉区早已开始播种。长江流域也已开始，安徽省沿江滨湖地区已经有20％左右的棉田播下种子。黄河流域结束棉花试播工作后，即将进入全面播种阶段。河北、山西、陕西、甘肃等省北部地区和东北的辽宁省，最近也将开始播种棉花。
    为了给今年实现一亿担棉花生产任务打下基础，各地对播种质量都很注意。陕西省订出的适时早播、合理密植、消灭大犁溜种，实行条播等八项保证播种质量的技术措施，正在全省推行。山东各地为了使棉苗一次出齐，达到苗全苗旺，正在积极推行适时播种一次播种的增产措施，高唐县已为此展开轰轰烈烈的竞赛。
    育苗移栽是促进棉花早熟丰产的一项成功经验。今年不但南方两熟棉区在大面积地推广这项经验，就是北方一熟棉区也在积极地推行。据初步计算，今年全国育苗移栽的棉田可以达到一千三百万亩左右。浙江老棉区用营养钵育苗移栽的棉田，将占到棉田面积80％。四川简阳县早育的棉苗已经开始移栽。河北石家庄专区不少人民公社用温床培育的棉苗已经陆续出土，这比起大田直播的棉花将提早发育近一个月左右。
    今年各地实现棉花大面积丰产的劲头很大。河北、陕西、湖北、湖南等地已经分别划出20％左右的棉田作为大面积丰产田。山西、山东、河南、安徽、江苏、辽宁等地的大面积丰产棉田，更将分别达到30％到50％。在大面积丰产田上，正在大搞耕作园田化。陕西有一百万亩大面积丰产棉田，已经在整地和排灌设施等方面初步达到了耕作园田化的要求。河北石家庄专区达到耕作园田化的丰产棉田，已经有一百三十万亩。
    今年许多地区扩大棉花种植面积，出现了不少新棉区。各地对这些新棉区都加强了领导，并且从技术上和物资上加以支援。安徽的新棉区都由各级党委书记挂帅，领导棉花生产。浙江在新扩大的棉区开办了六百人的植棉技术训练班，并且从老棉区调了两百多名植棉能手到新棉区当植棉技术辅导员。广东还从湖北地区聘请了几十名植棉技术辅导员来帮助新棉区。
    今年各地棉田备耕好。棉田翻耕深度一般达到七寸到一尺左右，浅的也有五寸多；深翻一尺以上的棉田，各省分别达到了占棉田面积四分之一到一半。在施底肥方面，据山东省对四十三个县五百八十七万亩棉田的调查，亩施底肥一万斤以上的占80％，比去年增加了很多。棉田冬灌春灌面积也扩大了。据河北、山西、山东、陕西四省统计，经过冬春灌溉的棉田约占四省棉田总面积55％，比去年扩大了一倍半。播种前，各地还展开了大规模的整地保墒工作，由于耙耱得好，绝大部分地区棉田墒情良好，为适时早播和苗全苗旺提供了条件。
