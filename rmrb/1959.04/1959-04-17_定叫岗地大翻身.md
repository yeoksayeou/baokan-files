    Win the Red Flag, Protect the Red Flag
    Xiangyang and Zaoyang Counties are closely adjacent, competing in cotton production to see who wins.
    Last year, Zaoyang took the lead, and Xiangyang came to present the red flag.
    Holding the red flag even higher, we are determined to let the red flag take root!
    This is a newly composed "Red Flag Song" by the people of Zaoyang. On March 5th, Secretary Liu of the Xiangyang County Party Committee, along with seventeen commune party secretaries and others, brought a large red flag inscribed with "Learn from Zaoyang, Keep Up with Zaoyang" to Zaoyang County. The masses in Zaoyang County beat drums and gongs, and the cheers were thunderous, as they accepted the red flag. The next day, Zaoyang County held a broadcast rally of 300,000 people; each commune and production team held meetings to discuss ways to "protect the red flag." They swore an oath to the red flag: "Hold high the red flag, advance victoriously, and forever protect the red flag!" The representatives of Xiangyang County returned and also convened a county-wide broadcast rally, their oath being: "Borrow the east wind, create huge waves, war drums urge on the leaping horses, Xiangyang is rising up quickly to catch up with Zaoyang!" They firmly stated: wherever the red flag is lost, they will win it back from there!

    The competition between the two counties is so heated, and the drive is so vigorous, because of historical roots.
    As everyone knows, Xiangyang Prefecture is a well-known low-yield area in Hubei Province. Within this prefecture, there is also a "Three Norths" region, namely the North of Zao(yang), the North of Xiang(yang), and the North of Guang(hua). This area is undulating with hills, and everywhere are thin and barren loess ridges, which are also the lowest-yielding areas within the low-yielding Xiangyang area. People describe these places as: "Sunny days are like a knife, rainy days are a complete mess," "Neither grain nor cotton grows." Taking cotton cultivation as an example, in good years, each mu (0.16 acres) could yield ten or so jin (a unit of weight, about 1.1 lbs) of ginned cotton, but in bad years, only six or seven jin were harvested. The masses in North Zaoyang describe it as: "One mu of cotton, a year's hard work, only makes a cotton quilt." The yield of grain crops is also very low, with only dozens of jin per mu, and more than a hundred jin is considered remarkable.
    For many years, the ridges have been described as "Not even maggots grow in the excrement, and seedlings are nowhere to be seen when crops are planted," "Don't marry your daughter to the Five Great Ridges, or she will drink thin soup for the rest of her life"...
    Last year, Zaoyang and Xiangyang Counties launched a competition. The Zaoyang County Party Committee conscientiously implemented the leadership work method of "grasping both ends and leading the middle," focusing on making the ridges catch up with the plains, and striving for large-area balanced yield increases. After a mass debate, the idea that ridge production had "no future" was shattered. Some "unfavorable conditions" of the ridges were transformed into favorable conditions in the face of people whose minds were liberated. For example, with more land, crop rotation could be adjusted, and more high-yielding spring cotton could be planted; with deep plowing, more fertilizer, and dense planting adapted to local conditions, the thin soil could also increase production. In early August last year, when the cotton on the ridges was growing vigorously, it was suddenly attacked by a fierce pest infestation. All the cadres and the broad masses of Zaoyang County went all out to fight the pests, tirelessly spraying and eliminating insects day and night, and the technical management was also meticulous. Xiangyang County was not lacking in enthusiasm and the cotton was growing well; however, in pest control and late-stage field management, they became complacent and relaxed, resulting in losing the competition.

    This year, Zaoyang County's planned cotton planting area is 600,000 mu, of which spring cotton has been expanded to 400,000 mu (mainly on the ridges), striving to increase the yield of ridge cotton from last year's 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu to 200 jin per mu. Three hundred thousand male and female commune members in the county conducted a mass airing of views, a great debate, and posted 500,000 big-character posters, tapping into the potential for increased production and criticizing the conservative thinking of "production reaching its peak." Based on the summary of last year's experience in increasing production, new technical measures were proposed, and a high tide of competition was launched throughout the county: "Leaders take the lead, everyone experiments, guaranteeing balanced and large-scale production increases." From the county party committee, communes to the teams, the vast number of cadres and commune members, 100,000 people have participated in high-yield experiments of 1,000 jin or 2,000 jin of seed cotton per mu. In order to help areas and production teams with a weaker foundation to rapidly change their appearance, the county recently sent more than 400 cadres to strengthen grassroots leadership.
    In the new year, people are determined to have another great leap forward, determined to make the barren land undergo a great transformation, and to forever plant the victorious red flag in Zaoyang County.

    Fighting at Qifang Ridge
    Qifang Ridge is the largest and poorest of the Five Great Ridges in the Zaobei area. "Don't marry your daughter to Qifang Ridge, sweet potato dumplings and thin rice soup," that's how the people on the plains looked down on the people on the ridges. However, that is a thing of the past. Now, the people on the ridges have straightened their backs, full of courage, determined to compete with the plains area. Last year, the Qifang People's Commune competed with the Lutou People's Commune, which had better natural conditions on the plains. The 68,000 mu of cotton fields in Qifang Ridge broke through the 100-jin mark of ginned cotton, an increase of nearly four times compared to the 22-jin yield per mu in 1957, and basically drew a tie with the Lutou Commune, which had better conditions. This year, a new battle between the two sides has begun. The Qifang Commune proposed "Guaranteeing a yield of 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu, determined to compete with Lutou."

    We took a car from the county seat to Qifang Ridge. The car climbed one slope after another, the driver kept adding fuel, and the engine hummed like an old ox snorting. The wheat fields on both sides of the road were a lush green. High-yield field signs were posted everywhere. On the crisscrossing field roads, carts carrying fertilizer, both horse-drawn and man-powered, formed a line, one team coming and another going, in an endless stream. Plowing was also done in groups, with each plow harnessed to a pair of oxen. The upturned yellow soil covered the black layer of fertilizer spread on the ground. Arriving at the commune party committee, none of the secretaries and directors were home. The first secretary had gone to Wuhan for a meeting, and the others had all gone to accumulate and deliver fertilizer. Secretary Yu, who received us, said: The whole commune has already plowed and harrowed more than three times over 50,000 mu of spring cotton land, and the deep plowing is also about one chi (a unit of length, about 1/3 meter) deep; each mu is required to apply 150 carts of base fertilizer (actually less than this number).
    In order to defeat the Lutou Commune, the Qifang Commune launched competitions on several fronts within the commune. Competitions were launched between teams and teams, groups and groups, and individuals and individuals. The opponents were mostly the old rivals from last year. The Yongfeng Production Team, which had good conditions, lost to the Longguang Production Team, which had poorer soil quality, last year. The Yongfeng Team was not convinced and requested to compete again this year. They summarized that the important reason for their loss last year was that they did not keep up with fertilizer accumulation, and the manure pits at the edge of the fields were not as many as those of the Longguang Team. Now, the Yongfeng Team has drawn 24 laborers to specialize in digging manure pits at the edge of the fields and have already dug 48. The days we visited, people were sending fertilizer to the fields. The entire team of more than 300 mu of spring cotton land had already applied 300 dan (a unit of weight, about 110 lbs) of soil fertilizer per mu. The Longguang Team was not to be outdone, and this year they want to achieve a 1,000-jin seed cotton team, with all the spring cotton land deeply plowed more than one chi. Their slogan is: "Start early, fight spring, and strive to walk ahead of Yongfeng."

    Heroic Women on the Ridges
    On the Five Great Ridges of North Zaoyang, women are a very active force. This may be because more cotton is planted on the ridges, and there are more technical tasks, which are suitable for the dexterity of women; perhaps it is because the difficult and arduous years on the ridges in the past have made them particularly eager for a happy life. After the realization of the people's commune, women were freed from tedious housework, and their participation in agricultural labor has become more and more outstanding than in the past.
    Leaving Zaoyang County and heading northeast along a yellow mud road, passing one ridge after another, arriving at Chenzhuang, which borders Henan Province, we met the "Girl King" who is famous throughout the county. Her name is Zhou Minghua, and she is the women's team leader of the Red Star Production Team of the Taiping People's Commune. Last year, her cotton experimental field achieved high yields and she was invited to participate in the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction. Thirty of the thirty-five "cotton girls" she leads were selected as cotton high-yield models for the entire county or commune. Zhou Minghua has planted two mu of experimental fields again this year, which have been plowed and harrowed three times, deeply plowed one chi and five cun (approx. 5/6 of a chi), applied 150 carts of base fertilizer per mu, preparing to densely plant 8,000 plants, strengthening technical management, and striving for higher yields than last year. The women's experimental team she leads is full of confidence in the new year, with amazing enthusiasm, and the miracle of high yields will surely continue to appear in their hands!

    The competition movement to strive for greater cotton harvests on the ridges is gradually penetrating into every household. Good stories of father-son competitions, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law competitions, and couple competitions are circulating everywhere. Wang Mingying, an old woman from the Jianlian Team of the Qifang People's Commune, joined the fertilizer transportation team and proposed to challenge her daughter-in-law, Cui Hualan. Cui Hualan said to her: "Mom, don't challenge me, it's better to challenge people in the mother-in-law's team. At your old age, how can you do this kind of work better than us young people?" Wang Mingying did not say anything. That night, she oiled the axle of her cart and loaded a cart of fertilizer well. Early the next morning, when her daughter-in-law went to fertilize, she had already delivered a cart to the field. As a result, the mother-in-law delivered three more carts than her daughter-in-law that day. When the group leader announced the matter of the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law competition, the daughter-in-law said to the mother-in-law: "I thought you were just joking yesterday, how did you really start doing it?"

    得红旗　保红旗
    襄枣二县紧相邻，棉花竞赛比输赢。
    去年枣阳领了先，襄阳来把红旗送。
    高举红旗更向前，定叫红旗扎下根！
    这是枣阳人民新编的一首“红旗歌”。3月5日，中共襄阳县委刘书记带领了公社党委书记等十七人，把一面写着“向枣阳学习，向枣阳看齐”的大红旗，送到枣阳县来。枣阳县的群众敲锣打鼓，欢声雷动，接受了这面红旗。第二天，枣阳县举行了三十万人的广播大会；各公社、生产队集会讨论了“保红旗”的办法。他们向红旗宣誓：“高举红旗，乘胜前进，永保红旗！”襄阳县的代表回去，也召开了全县的广播大会，他们的誓词是：“借东风，掀巨浪，战鼓紧催跃进马，襄阳急起赶枣阳！”他们坚决表示：红旗输给哪里，还从哪里赢回！
    两个县竞赛如此火热，干劲如此勇猛，是有历史渊源的。
    人们都知道，襄阳专区是湖北省有名的低产区。在这个专区里，又有个“三北”地区，即枣（阳）北、襄（阳）北和光（化）北地区。这一带丘陵起伏，到处是土质薄瘦的黄土岗，又是襄阳低产区里的低产区。人们形容这些地方是：“天晴一把刀，下雨一团糟”，“不长五谷不长（棉）花”。就拿种棉花来说吧，好年头每亩地能收十来斤（皮棉），年成差点只落得六、七斤。枣北群众形容说：“一亩棉花，一年的辛苦，只做得一床棉套子。”种粮食作物的产量也很低，每亩只收几十斤，多的百把斤就算了不起。
    多少年来，岗地被人们说成是“屙屎不生蛆，种庄稼不见苗”，“有女不嫁五大岗，一生跟上喝稀汤”……。
    去年，枣阳和襄阳两县展开了竞赛。枣阳县委认真贯彻执行了“抓两头，带中间”的领导工作方法，大抓岗地赶平原，力争大面积平衡增产。经过全民大辩论，打破了岗地生产“无前途”的说法。岗地有些
  “不利条件”，在思想获得解放的人们面前变成了有利条件。如土地多可以调茬轮作，多种产量高的春棉花；土质薄经过深耕、多施肥和因地制宜的密植，也就可以增产。去年8月初，岗上棉花正长得旺盛，突然遭到一场凶猛的虫害袭击，枣阳县全体干部和广大群众全力以赴大战虫害，日夜不息打药除虫，技术管理也做得细致。襄阳县本来干劲也不差，棉花也长得好；但在防治虫害和后期田间管理中，由于思想麻痹自满，松了一口气，结果在竞赛中输了。
    今年枣阳县棉花的计划播种面积是六十万亩，其中春棉花扩大到四十万亩（主要在岗地），力争岗地棉花由去年亩产百斤皮棉提高到亩产双百斤。全县三十万男女社员，进行了大鸣大放大辩论，并贴出五十万张大字报，挖出了增产潜力，批判了“增产到顶”的保守思想。在总结去年增产经验的基础上提出了新的技术措施，全县掀起了“领导带头干，人人搞试验，保证平衡大增产”的竞赛高潮。从县委、公社到队的广大干部和社员群众，已有十万人参加了亩产千斤或双千斤籽棉的丰产试验，为了帮助基础较差的地区和生产队迅速改变面貌，最近由县里派出了四百多名干部，加强基层领导。
    在新的一年，人们决心再来一个大跃进，定叫岗地生产大翻身，把胜利的红旗永远插在枣阳县。
    奋战七方岗
    七方岗，是枣北地区五大岗中最大最穷的一条岗。“有女莫嫁七方岗，红薯疙瘩稀米汤”，平原人就是这样看不起岗上人家。然而，这是过去的事了。现在，岗上的人挺起了腰板，勇气百倍，定要和平原区赛一赛。去年，七方人民公社就和平原上自然条件较好的鹿头人民公社赛上了。七方岗六万八千多亩棉田突破了皮棉百斤关，比1957年亩产二十二斤增产将近四倍，和条件好的鹿头公社基本上打了个平手。今年，双方一场新的争夺战开始了。七方公社提出“保证亩产皮棉双百斤，决心和鹿头拼一拼”。
    我们从县城搭汽车到七方岗，汽车爬过一个坡又一个坡，司机不断地加油，马达哼哈作响好似老牛打喷鼻。公路两旁的麦田，一片油绿。到处插着丰产田的牌子。在纵横交错的田间大路上，运送肥料的大马车、人拉车、手推车，联成了一条线，一队来一队去，络绎不绝。犁地也是成群结队的，每张犁都架着双套牛，翻起的黄土把撒在地面乌黑一层的肥料压盖了。到达公社党委会，几位书记和社长都不在家，第一书记到武汉开会去了，其他几位都积肥送肥去了。接待我们的余秘书说：全社已有五万亩春花地犁耙三道以上，深耕也有一尺左右；每亩要求施底肥一百五十车（实际不足这个数字）。
    为了战胜鹿头公社，七方公社在内部展开几条战线的竞赛。队与队之间，小组与小组之间，个人与个人之间，都展开了竞赛。对象大都还是去年的老对手。条件好的永丰生产队，去年输给了土质较差的龙光生产队。永丰队不服气，今年要求再来。他们总结去年输了的重要原因是肥料没赶上，地头粪坑没有龙光队的多。现在，永丰队抽出二十四个劳力专挖地头粪坑，已经挖好四十八个。我们去的那几天，人们正在往地里送肥。全队三百多亩春花地，每亩已施三百担土肥。龙光队也不示弱，今年要实现籽棉千斤队，全部春花地都深耕一尺以上。他们的口号是：“早动手，战春天，争取走在永丰前。”
    岗上的巾帼英雄
    枣北五大岗上，妇女们是一支顶活跃的生力军。这也许是因为岗地上棉花种的多，技术活路也多，适合于妇女们心灵手巧的特点；也许是因为过去岗地上艰难困苦的岁月，使她们对幸福生活的追求特别殷切。实现人民公社化以后，妇女们摆脱了繁琐的家务劳动，参加农业劳动就比往日更多更出色了。
    出了枣阳县城，沿一条黄泥巴路往东北走，过了一岗又一岗，来到和河南省交界的陈庄，我们会见了名扬全县的“姑娘王”。她叫周明华，是太平人民公社红星生产队的妇女队长。去年她种的棉花试验田，获得了高额丰产，被邀参加了全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议。她领导的三十五个“棉花姑娘”中有三十个被选为全县或公社的棉花丰产模范。周明华今年又种了两亩试验田，已经犁耙三次，深耕一尺五，每亩施底肥一百五十车，准备密植八千株，加强技术管理，争取比去年更高的产量。她领导的妇女试验队，对新的一年充满信心，干劲惊人，丰产的奇迹一定会在她们手里不断出现！
    争取岗地棉花更大丰收的竞赛运动，逐步深入到每家每户。父子比赛，婆媳比赛，俩口比赛的佳话到处流传。七方人民公社建联队有个老婆婆王明英参加了运肥队，并提出要和她的媳妇崔华兰挑战。崔华兰对她说：“妈，你莫跟我挑战，还是和婆婆队里的人挑战好，你这大年纪，干这种活，还干得过我们年青人？”王明英听了也不哼声，当晚回来，把车子轮轴上好油，又把一车肥上好。第二天一早，等她媳妇上肥时，她已经往地里送了一车。结果，这一天婆婆比媳妇多送了三车。小组长把这场婆媳竞赛的事一宣布，媳妇对婆婆说：“我以为你老人家昨天是说着玩的，怎么真的干起来了？”
