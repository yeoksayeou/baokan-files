    Mutually Beneficial Cooperation, Moving Forward Hand in Hand
    Pingnan County and Yin Xian People's Commune in Shou County Develop Equivalent and Mutually Beneficial Cooperation to Accelerate Spring Planting Progress
    (This report) According to our newspaper, the communes and the production brigades and production teams of Pingnan County, Guangxi Province, have implemented equivalent cooperation, which has greatly accelerated the progress of rice transplanting in the county.
    Initially, the progress of rice transplanting in this county was extremely unbalanced: the mountainous areas were faster, and the plains were slower; areas with water were faster, and areas lacking water were slower. Within the communes, some brigades were faster, and some were slower. Within the brigades, some production teams were fast, and some were slow. The main reasons for the slow progress of some brigades and production teams were: some had more land but less labor and cattle power; some started late because they had been vigorously planting dryland crops in the previous stage; and some had a serious shortage of seedlings due to rotten and dead seedlings.
    In order to help the units with slower transplanting progress to avoid missing the farming season, the county party committee put forward the slogan of "mutually beneficial cooperation, helping each other, and moving forward hand in hand." All localities immediately launched a large-scale transplanting cooperation of you help me and I help you. Gan Dong brigade and Ping Shan brigade of Ping Shan Commune, which were originally linked for competition, Gan Dong brigade's cadres and members, after learning that Ping Shan brigade was not keeping up with the season in transplanting rice and was short of seedlings, organized more than 250 people to provide support and sent their surplus seedlings to Ping Shan brigade to ensure the timely completion of early rice transplanting. Xin Tang brigade of Liu Chen Commune has more than 1,400 mu of fields that have not yet been transplanted, so four brigades, including Gu He and Huang Hua, organized an army of 626 people to support Xin Tang brigade with their own cattle, luggage, tools and grain. With the support of these four brigades, Xin Tang brigade's more than 1,400 mu of early rice fields were transplanted in just two days. In addition, production teams within the brigades also supported and cooperated with each other. According to incomplete statistics, more than 150 production teams in the county supported each other, sending more than 3,500 people to provide support.
    In the process of mutual support, all localities have implemented the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit, and signed contracts with each other. For example, Da Xin Commune has 44 production teams that have signed contracts with each other. The way to resolve mutual benefit is to exchange work for work. The supporting units record how much work they have provided, and will return the same amount of work in the future. If only part of the work can be returned, the remaining part will be paid in cash. The amount of wages will be resolved through negotiation between the two parties.
    (This report) According to our newspaper, in the midst of a large-scale production competition, production teams of Yin Xian People's Commune in Shou County, Anhui Province, actively carried out cooperation in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange, which effectively promoted current production.
    This commune has more than 70 production teams. Due to differences in conditions such as cultivated land, agricultural implements, labor, and animal power, the production progress among the teams is very uneven. For example, Hou Lou brigade has more labor (an average of three mu of land per person), good soil quality, complete agricultural implements, and more draft animals, so the production progress is faster. However, Gao Wa brigade has less labor (an average of six mu of land per person), poor soil quality, incomplete agricultural implements, and a lack of draft animals, so although their enthusiasm is great, they cannot keep up with Hou Lou brigade. After studying this issue, the commune party committee believed that it was necessary to organize large-scale cooperation to help the teams with a weaker foundation to improve production. The commune party committee first conducted extensive and in-depth ideological education among the masses to enable cadres and members to establish a global perspective in cooperation; at the same time, it guided members to discuss the benefits of cooperation using recall methods. The issue of remuneration in cooperation is resolved according to the principle of equivalent exchange, such as seeds being borrowed in the spring and returned in the summer at a discounted price, labor being returned in kind, goods being exchanged at a discounted price, or purchased in cash.
    Now, a upsurge of large-scale cooperation has been set off in the production teams of this commune. After discussion, Hou Lou brigade provided 68,000 jin of surplus sweet potato seeds and 100,000 jin of native fertilizer to its competitor, Gao Wa brigade. They also provided more than 320,000 jin of native fertilizer to Shi Si brigade. In order to help Tang Bei brigade to deep-plow cotton fields, they organized more than 800 strong laborers and 268 cattle from the neighboring Yin Bei and Shi Si brigades to provide support. In the process of providing labor and material support, many competing parties also provided timely support according to the seasonal needs of crops. For example, Zhang Ci team urgently needed fertilizer for 400 mu of cotton fields, while the competitor, Xie Ting team, temporarily did not need to apply much fertilizer due to the large area of rice fields, so they took the initiative to lend 4,700 dan of native fertilizer to Zhang Ci team, ensuring timely sowing of cotton fields. At the same time, many competing parties also passed on their advanced technologies and experiences to each other. (Chen Liyan)

### 互利协作　携手前进  平南县和寿县隐贤公社等价互利展开协作加快了春耕进度

    互利协作　携手前进
    平南县和寿县隐贤公社等价互利展开协作加快了春耕进度
    本报讯　广西平南县公社与公社之间、大队与大队之间、生产队与生产队之间实行等价协作，使全县插秧进度大大加快。
    起初，这个县的插秧进度极不平衡：山区较快，平原较慢；有水地区较快，缺水地区则慢。公社内有较快的大队，也有较慢的大队。大队内有快的生产队，也有慢的生产队。有些大队和生产队插得慢的主要原因是：有的属于土地多劳力、牛力少；有的是前段大力抢种旱地作物，动手较晚；有的因烂秧死秧严重，秧苗缺。
    为了帮助插秧进度较慢的单位不误农时，县委提出“互利协作，互相帮助，携手前进”的口号，各地立即开展一个你帮我我帮你的插秧大协作。平山公社橄垌大队和平山大队，原是互相挂钩竞赛的，橄垌大队的干部和社员知道平山大队插秧赶不上季节，又缺乏秧苗以后，组织了二百五十多人去支援，并把自己多余的秧苗送给平山大队，保证适时插完了早稻。六陈公社新塘大队有一千四百多亩田，还没有插下秧，古和、黄花等四个大队就组织了六百二十六人的支援大军，自带耕牛、行李、工具和粮食支援新塘大队抢插，在这四个大队的支援下，新塘大队的一千四百多亩早稻田，仅两天时间就插完了。此外大队内的生产队与生产队之间也互相支援协作。据不完全统计全县互相支援的生产队有一百五十多个，出动支援人数三千五百多人。
    各地在互相支援中，贯彻执行了等价交换彼此互利的原则，互相签订合同，如大新公社就有四十四个生产队互相签订合同。各地解决互利办法是以工换工，支援单位支援了多少工，先记上账，将来照数还工，如只能还一部分，剩余部分则支付现金，工资多少，双方协商解决。
    本报讯　安徽省寿县隐贤人民公社各生产队在生产大竞赛中，依照等价交换的原则，积极开展协作，有力地推动了当前生产。
    这个公社共有七十多个生产队，由于耕地、农具、劳力、畜力等条件的差别，各队之间的生产进度很不平衡。如后楼大队劳力多（每人平均三亩田）、土质好，农具齐全、耕畜多，生产进度较快，而高瓦大队由于劳力少（每人平均六亩田）、土质坏、农具不全、耕畜缺乏，虽然干劲很大，总赶不上后楼大队。公社党委研究这个问题后，认为必须组织大协作，帮助基础较差的队搞好生产。公社党委首先在群众中进行了广泛深入地思想教育，使干部和社员在协作中树立了全局观点；同时引导社员用回忆的方法讨论了协作的好处。协作中的报酬问题，根据等价交换原则，如种子折价春借夏还，劳力还工，物品折价交换或现金购买等办法解决。
    现在这个公社各生产队掀起了大协作的热潮。后楼大队通过讨论后，把全队节余的六万八千斤甘薯种，十万斤土化肥支援竞赛对手高瓦大队，还支援时寺大队土化肥三十二万多斤。为了帮助塘北大队深翻棉田，他们又与邻近的隐北、时寺大队组织八百多强壮劳力和二百六十八条牛前去支援。在进行劳力和物力支援中，许多竞赛双方，还根据作物季节需要，做到支援及时。如张祠队由于四百亩棉花田急需肥料，而竞赛对手谢厅队因水稻面积大，暂时不需要多施肥料，就主动把四千七百担土化肥借给张祠队，保证了棉田及时播种。同时，许多竞赛双方还把自己掌握的先进技术和经验传授给对方。（陈立言）
