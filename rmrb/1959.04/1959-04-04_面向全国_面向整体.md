Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd: In Jiangsu, under the slogans of "Shanghai first, then ourselves" and "The overall situation first, then the local situation," a large amount of pig iron has been continuously transferred to support Shanghai. Since the beginning of this year, the province has overfulfilled its pig iron transfer tasks every month, both in terms of quantity and quality.

Many areas and units in Jiangsu Province have implemented the spirit of "the whole country as one chess game" in ensuring the transfer of pig iron. Suzhou, Xuzhou, and other special districts did not arrange a single ton of pig iron for their own use before completing the transfer task. More than twenty units, including Wuxi Machine Tool Factory, Casting Factory, and Diesel Engine Factory, have all expressed their willingness to do without themselves in order to complete the transfer task.

In order to ensure more and better iron is produced to support Shanghai, workers in smelting units across the region have launched a vigorous high-yield, high-quality competition. Workers in the ironmaking workshop of the Suzhou Iron Factory have worked hard to learn from the experience of advanced areas and actively improved their operating techniques. Currently, they have reduced the sulfur content of pig iron to below 0.1%, and the pass rate of pig iron has also increased from 70% to 90%. After the workers of the ironmaking workshop of Changzhou Dacheng No. 1 Factory promoted advanced experiences such as large air volume and high air temperature, not only did the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reach above 2, but also greatly improved the quality of pig iron, with good iron suitable for steelmaking and casting accounting for 97% of the total pig iron production.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 2nd: Shandong has transferred more than 100,000 tons of pig iron to Shanghai and other places in the past three months, following the principle of "external first, internal second".

The relevant leading departments in Shandong regard the transfer of pig iron to support Shanghai and other places as an extremely glorious task. The provincial party committee and leading organs such as the Provincial Metallurgical Bureau have held many meetings to specifically study the quantity and quality of pig iron to be transferred, and have proposed a series of guarantee measures in terms of organizational work, management work, technical operation, and allocation and transportation. At the same time, various localities have also adopted the method of producing, testing, concentrating, and transporting simultaneously to ensure the smooth transfer of pig iron. Jinan and other places have also established pig iron transfer headquarters, headed by the party committee secretary, to arrange daily and keep a close watch at all times.

Since mid-March, Shandong has determined that, in addition to ensuring a small number of special needs within the province, all qualified pig iron produced should be transferred out, leaving the poorer quality for its own use.

Our newspaper, Chongqing, 3rd: A large amount of grain from Sichuan Province is being transported out continuously. In recent days, at the wharves along the Yangtze River and at the stations along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway in Sichuan Province, tens of millions of jin of Sichuan grain are being shipped out every day, doubling the usual amount of external transportation. At present, a large amount of grain is being gathered from the countryside to the granaries along the transportation lines.

The Sichuan grain transferred out this year is mainly to support large cities such as Shanghai and industrial bases such as Liaoning Province. Under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as one chess game," the enthusiasm of farmers and grain department workers across the province for transferring surplus grain to support national economic construction is very high. In counties with external transfer tasks, tens of thousands of farmers are using the intervals of spring plowing and production to transport the surplus grain planned by the state to designated locations. People's communes in Wusheng County have adopted the method of "one package (contracting tasks), two determinations (determining time and place), and three implementations (labor arrangement, grain transport wage standards, and living welfare)" to comprehensively arrange grain transport work. The party committee secretaries of the Zouma, Yanhe and other people's communes in the county transported grain together with the masses, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the commune members to transport grain. The county's plan to transfer more than 12 million jin of surplus grain in March was completed on March 16. Farmers in the mountainous areas of Wanxian County could not spare labor to transport grain due to the tight spring plowing and production. Residents of towns along the river immediately selected strong personnel to form grain transport teams to help farmers in mountainous areas transport out a large amount of stored grain. Farmers in many areas have put forward the slogan "Grain is a treasure, construction cannot do without it; production must not be delayed, grain transportation must be grasped firmly," and tried every possible means to complete the grain external transfer plan ahead of schedule.

In order to unify the arrangement of the transfer of pig iron, grain and other materials, grain transport headquarters have also been specially established to carefully organize the labor force and arrange the living supplies for migrant workers. Employees of grain departments in various counties have generally inspected the grain transferred out to ensure that the best rice and wheat are transferred out of the province.

    面向全国  面向整体
    江苏山东大批生铁源源外运
    四川粮食水陆兼程运往各地
    新华社南京2日电　江苏各地在“先上海、后自己”，“先大局、后小局”的口号下，把大批生铁源源调出支援了上海。今年以来，全省每月都按质按量地超额完成了生铁外调任务。
    江苏省不少地区和单位在保证生铁外调当中，都贯彻了全国一盘棋的精神。苏州、徐州等专区在未完成外调任务以前，没有安排一吨生铁自用。无锡机床厂、铸件厂、柴油机厂等二十多个单位，都表示宁愿自己不用，也要完成外调任务。
    为了保证多出铁、出好铁支援上海，各地冶炼单位职工深入展开了轰轰烈烈的高产优质竞赛。苏州铁工厂炼铁车间各班工人努力学习先进地区的经验，积极改进操作技术，目前已经把生铁的含硫量降低到0.1％以下，生铁合格率也由70％提高到90％。常州大成一厂炼铁车间职工推广大风量高风温等先进经验以后，不仅使高炉的利用系数达到了二以上，而且大大提高了生铁的质量，符合炼钢、铸造的好铁占全部生铁产量的97％。
    新华社济南2日电　山东各地本着“先外后内”的原则，在最近三个月内已经把十万多吨生铁调往上海等地。
    山东各有关领导部门把外调生铁支援上海等地，当作一项极光荣的任务，省委及省冶金局等领导机关，曾经召开多次会议，专门研究外调生铁的数量和质量问题，并且从组织工作、管理工作、技术操作、调拨运输等方面，提出了一系列的保证措施。与此同时，各地还采取边生产、边化验、边集中、边运出的办法，保证了生铁的顺利外调。济南等地还建立了生铁调运指挥部，由党委书记挂帅，作到天天安排，时时抓紧。
    山东各地自3月中旬起，确定除了保证省内少数特殊需用之外，要把所产质量合格的生铁全部外调，留下质量较差的自用。
    本报重庆3日电　四川省大批粮食正在源源外运。这几天，四川省境内沿长江各个码头和宝成铁路各个车站上，每天都有一千几百万斤川粮运出，外运量比平时增加一倍。目前还有大批的粮食正从农村向交通沿线的粮仓汇集。
    今年外调的川粮主要是支援上海等大城市和辽宁省等工业基地。在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下，全省农民和粮食部门的职工对外调余粮支援国家经济建设的热情是很高的。有外调任务的县份，成千上万的农民利用春耕生产间隙时间，把国家计划调出的余粮运到指定地点。武胜县各地人民公社采取一包（包任务）、二定（定时间、地点）、三落实（劳力安排、运粮工资标准、生活福利）的办法全面安排运粮工作。这个县的走马、沿河等人民公社党委书记和群众一起运粮，大大鼓舞了社员运粮热情。全县三月份计划外调的一千二百多万斤余粮，在3月16日已全部完成。万县山区的农民，由于春耕生产紧张，抽不出劳动力运送粮食。沿江的城镇居民，立即选拔体力强壮的人员，组成运粮队，帮助山区农民运出大批存粮。许多地区的农民提出“粮食是个宝，建设少不了；生产绝不误，运粮要抓牢”的口号，千方百计争取提前完成粮食外调计划。
    各地为统一安排生铁、粮食和其他物资的调运工作，还专门成立了运粮指挥部，认真组织劳动力、安排民工生活供应等工作。各县粮食部门的职工，对外调粮食普遍进行了检验，保证把最好的大米和小麦调往省外。
