Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 11th – Anhui Province is currently constructing and renovating six railway lines.

The six railway lines are: Huainan Line (Bengbu to Yuxikou), Ningwu Line (Nanjing to Wuhu), Wuxuan Line (Wuhu to Xuancheng), Wufan Line (Wuhu to Fanchang), Fuxiao Line (Fuliji to Xiao County), Xiangma Line (Xiangshan to Ma’anshan), totaling over 500 kilometers. Except for the Huainan, Ningwu, and Xiangma lines, which are undergoing technical renovations on the existing basis, the rest are newly built. Upon completion of the reconstruction and new construction, it will further promote the development of industry and agriculture in the province.

The railways in Anhui bear a large transportation volume. After the establishment of steel bases along the Huainan line and on the west bank of the Yangtze River last year, the materials that need to be transported on the Huainan line alone this year will increase by 75% compared with last year. These transport volumes require large locomotives to haul, and can only be met by passing twenty-two pairs of trains every day. The Huainan line is a light rail line with steep slopes, some low roadbeds, short station lines, and few tracks, so only small locomotives can be used to haul, and twelve pairs of trains can be run every day. After technical renovations on the existing basis, to meet the national first-class railway trunk line standards, large locomotives can be used, and the traction capacity can be increased by more than 1,000 tons compared to the original locomotives, and twenty-four pairs of trains can be run every day.

　　促进省内工农业生产更大发展
　　安徽改建、新建六条铁路
    新华社合肥11日电　安徽省目前正在新建和改建六条铁路线。
    这六条铁路线是：淮南线（蚌埠到裕溪口），宁芜线（南京到芜湖），芜宣线（芜湖到宣城），芜繁线（芜湖到繁昌），符萧线（符离集到萧县），向马线（向山到马鞍山），共长五百多公里；除了淮南、宁芜、向马线是在原有基础上进行技术改造的以外，其余都是新建。改建和新建工程完工以后，将进一步促进省内工农业的发展。
    安徽境内铁路负担运量很大。去年在淮南沿线和长江西岸建立起钢铁基地以后，仅淮南线今年需要运输的物资就比去年增加75％。这些运量，需要大型机车牵引，每天通过二十二对车才能满足。淮南线路是轻轨线路，坡度大，有的路基低，站线短，股道道少，只能用小型机车牵引，每天开十二对车。这条线路在原有基础上进行技术改造，达到符合国家一级铁路干线标准以后，就可以改用大型机车牵引，牵引能力约可比原有机车提高一千多吨，每天能开二十四对车。
