Comrades Chairman, Fellow Delegates:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, and with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

1958 was a year of significant victories on all fronts in our country (including the scientific research front), and a year of great leap forward in our country's scientific endeavors.

As a scientific worker at the Institute of Petroleum of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I felt particularly keenly the parts of Premier Zhou's report concerning scientific research. I would like to share my experiences and understanding in this regard.

Under the radiant guidance of the Party's General Line, due to the Great Leap Forward in industry, the petroleum scientific research last year faced hundreds of large and small problems that needed to be solved. The tasks spurred the research work, resulting in a magnificent high tide of the leap forward.

**"Chinese-style Hydrogenation Method" Achieved Initial Success**

For example, last year, the all-Party and all-people steelmaking and ironmaking campaign produced no less than hundreds of thousands of tons of coal tar, and the rational utilization of coal tar became a major issue. Four or five years ago, we had considered using the principle of hydrogen transfer to reduce pressure, changing from 300 atmospheres to 50-100 atmospheres, to hydrogenate and crack coal tar into gasoline and diesel. However, at that time, it was believed that foreign countries had been working on lignite tar for many years without conclusive results, and the problem was very complex; China mainly used bituminous coal tar, which was even more complex. Our strength was weak, and our level was low, and it would be difficult to see results in three to five years. The Central Committee's proposal to break down superstitions liberated our thinking. We took over the work that was originally intended to be done abroad. At that time, we were both happy and fearful, promising to produce results in two years. Unexpectedly, the industrial departments repeatedly urged and "challenged" us, and the research comrades became more and more confident. Under the specific leadership of the Party, the "mysteries" of catalysts and diluents were broken one by one. In just eight months, we produced pioneering results, passed the assessment of the design department, and established a pilot plant. It has been decided to build a production plant this year. Now, our hydrogenation researchers call this method "Chinese-style Hydrogenation Method." This achievement of our great socialist motherland, standing at the forefront of science and technology, is indeed a source of joy and pride.

**Solved the Critical Problem of Waste Gas Fumigation**

For another example, in conjunction with the shortage of coking coal in Liaoning Province, our Coal Research Office studied the manufacture of blast furnace fuel from non-caking coal, coke powder, or semi-coke. In the past, it was considered profound, and we were afraid to start due to our low level. Last year, the urgent needs of production promoted this work. After the comrades' day and night research, hard work, and ingenuity, they finally solved the critical problem of waste gas fumigation. After this procedure, the mixture's pellets can be refined into solid and active blast furnace fuel. The finished product has been tested in a thirteen-cubic-meter blast furnace, with a usage of 60 percent and good performance. A on-site conference was held in Lushun-Dalian to promote it. The use of this pellet fuel can partially overcome the difficulty of the region's lack of coke. This work, like other research work, still needs to be deepened, because it is a new direction for research on metallurgical coke; it is also under development abroad, and it has extremely broad prospects.

**Created Conditions for Radiation Processing and Radiation Chemistry Research**

Also, in the vision of developing petroleum processing, the use of radiation processing is a new direction. We planned this new direction in 1955 and wanted to start it. However, carrying out this scientific research requires new tools such as accelerators and strong radiation energy sources, and there were many difficulties. In the past, we only talked about these problems, but we didn't dare to act. Last year, in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, our minds were liberated, and comrades dared to think and dare to do. A working group was established. Under the deep concern and specific support of the Lushun-Dalian Municipal Party Committee, and with the assistance of 20 factories in Lushun-Dalian and brother institutes in Beijing, it took only 28 days to assemble an electrostatic accelerator using completely domestically produced components, creating conditions for carrying out research on radiation processing and radiation chemistry.

There are many such examples of new research achievements, rapidly advancing towards the peak of science, in scientific research institutions across the country.

As mentioned above, under the radiant guidance of the Party's General Line, our research work has made great progress and changes in 1958. The reason is that in the great rectification movement, on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, the bourgeois ideology was powerfully exposed and criticized, and bourgeois individualism was discredited. The socialist revolution achieved a major victory on the political and ideological fronts. The socialist consciousness of researchers has greatly increased, and the relationship between each other has greatly improved. In this way, the Party's leadership was strengthened in scientific research work, and the mass line was implemented. Due to putting politics in command, being both red and expert, breaking down superstitions, and liberating thinking, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses were greatly promoted. Due to the gradual establishment of communist style, the spirit of great collaboration between units and within units has been implemented in all aspects of work. Therefore, we were able to complete research projects that we did not dare to think or do in the past. All of these fully illustrate the achievements of last year's Great Leap Forward and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

Our petroleum and coal science endeavors are a part of the entire socialist construction cause, with unlimitedly bright prospects and extremely arduous tasks. On this great and rapidly advancing road, it is impossible to have no difficulties and shortcomings. Chairman Mao often taught us to be honest and diligent, to encourage and help each other, and to avoid any exaggeration and pride. Difficulties and shortcomings can be overcome. On the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, we must strive for in-depth work, improved quality, and pay attention to basic theoretical work. The work requires quality, practice requires theory, and theory guides practice. We must study Premier Zhou's report in depth. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we are more confident and more certain to achieve greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward in petroleum and coal science research.

Finally, I would like to say a few words about the comprehensive utilization of coal. In the Great Leap Forward last year, the coal industry developed rapidly, and its output exceeded that of the United Kingdom. In the near future, our country will become one of the countries with the most coal production, possibly jumping to the second or third place in the world. How to most rationally and comprehensively utilize this largest resource to ensure the great development of the iron and steel, electric power, petroleum, chemical industry and agriculture is a very important issue.

It should be admitted that our country's scientific and technological strength in the comprehensive utilization of coal is still very weak, and the strength is also very scattered, which is extremely disproportionate to the development of our cause. Therefore, I suggest that in the areas where coal reserves are the richest and coal production is higher, (1) establish a Coal Comprehensive Utilization College, and (2) establish a Coal Science Research Center. Only in this way can we gradually catch up with the requirements of our country's industrial and agricultural production and the needs of the people across the country.

Please correct me if any of the above points are inappropriate.

    石油科学研究中的新成就
    张大煜代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    一九五八年，是我国各个战线（包括科学研究战线在内）取得重大胜利的一年，是我国科学事业出现大跃进的一年。
    我是中国科学院石油研究所的科学工作者，听了周总理报告中有关科学研究工作的部分，特别感到真切，现在想就这一方面谈谈我的体会和认识。
    在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，去年的石油科学研究中，由于工业的大跃进，需要解决的课题大大小小数以百计。任务推动了研究工作，由此出现了声势壮阔的跃进高潮。
    “中国式的加氢法”首创成功
    例如，去年的全党全民炼钢炼铁中，焦油产量不下几十万吨，合理利用焦油就成了大问题。过去四、五年前，我们曾多次考虑过利用传氢的原理来降低压力、由三百大气压变为五十至一百气压下、使焦油加氢裂化成汽油和柴油。但当时认为国外搞褐煤焦油，工作多年，没有肯定结果，问题很不简单；我国主要是烟煤焦油，复杂得多。我们力量薄弱，水平低，非三、五年难见成效。中央提出破除迷信解放了我们的思想。把原拟交国外去做的工作接了过来。当时的心情是一则以喜，一则以惧，答应两年出结果。岂料产业部门一再督促，一再“将军”，而研究工作同志也愈干愈有信心，在党的具体领导下，催化剂、稀释剂等“神秘”一一破除，在短短八个月中就作出了首创性的结果，通过了设计部门的考核，建立起了试验工厂。今年决定要建立生产工厂。现在，我们的加氢研究工作者都把这个方法称为“中国式的加氢法”。我们伟大的社会主义祖国的这种站到科学技术先进行列的成就，确实令人感到喜悦，感到自豪。
    解决了关键性的废气熏蒸问题
    再如，结合辽宁省炼焦煤不足的情况，我们煤炭室研究了从不粘结煤、焦粉或半焦制造高炉燃料。过去认为深奥，自己水平低，迟迟不敢上马。去年生产上的迫切需要，推动了这项工作。经过了同志们的日夜钻研，苦干巧干，终于解决了关键性的废气熏蒸问题。经过这道手续，可把混合物的球团炼成坚固和具有相当活性的高炉燃料。成品已在十三立方公尺的高炉内试过，用量百分之六十、性能良好。旅大市开过现场会议加以推广。使用这种球团燃料可以部分克服本地区缺乏焦炭的困难。这项工作同其他研究工作一样还需要深入下去，因为它是一个研究冶金焦的新方向；在国外也刚在发展中，它是有极其广阔前途的。为辐射加工和辐射化学研究创造了条件
    又如，在发展石油加工的远景中，利用辐射线加工是个新的方向。这个新的方向我们在一九五五年加以规划，曾想上马。但进行这项科学研究需要新的工具如加速器及强的辐射能源等，困难重重。过去对这些问题我们只是谈谈，是不敢动手的。去年在大跃进的高潮中，思想解放了，同志们敢想敢做，建立了一个工作小组。在旅大市委的深切关怀和具体支持、旅大二十个工厂和北京兄弟所的协助下，仅仅用了二十八天的工夫，就装起了一台完全用国产元件的静电加速器，为进行辐射加工和辐射化学的研究创造了条件。
    这些崭新的研究成果，快速地向科学高峰迈进的事例，在全国各科学研究机构里是很多的。
    如上所述，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，一九五八年我们的研究工作有了很大的发展和变化。其原因是由于伟大整风运动中，在反右斗争胜利的基础上，有力地揭发和批判了资产阶级的思想，搞臭了资产阶级个人主义，在政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命取得了重大的胜利。研究人员的社会主义的觉悟大大提高，相互间关系大大改进。这样，在科学研究工作中，加强了党的领导，贯彻了群众路线。由于政治挂帅，又红又专，破除迷信，解放思想，群众的积极性和创造性大为发扬。由于共产主义风格的逐渐建立，各单位间、单位内部之间大协作的精神贯彻到各项工作，因而我们过去所不敢想不敢做的研究课题能够完成。所有这些都充分说明了去年大跃进的成绩和社会主义制度的无比优越。
    我们的石油和煤炭科学事业是整个社会主义建设事业的一部分，前途无限远大，任务亦极其繁重。在这个伟大的迅速前进道路上，不可能没有困难和缺点。毛主席经常教导我们要老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何虚夸和骄傲。困难和缺点是可以克服的。在去年大跃进的基础上，我们要力求工作深入，质量提高，并重视基础理论工作。工作要求质量，实践要求理论，理论指导实践。我们要深入学习周总理的报告，在一九五八年大跃进基础上，我们更有信心更有把握在石油和煤炭科学研究上取得更大更好更全面的跃进。
    最后还想关于煤的综合利用谈几句话。在去年大跃进中，煤炭工业飞跃发展，产量超过了英国，不久将来我国将成为产煤最多的国家之一，可能跃到世界第二、三位。如何最合理地综合利用这一项最大的资源，以保证钢铁、电力、石油、化学工业和农业的大发展是一个十分重要的问题。
    应当承认我国煤的综合利用方面的科学技术力量还是很薄弱的，而且力量也很分散，与我们事业的发展极不相称。因此建议：在我国煤储藏最丰富而煤产量较高的地区，（1）设立一个煤综合利用学院，（2）设立一个煤炭科学研究的中心。这样才可逐渐赶上我国工农业生产的要求和全国人民生活的需要。
    以上各点，是否恰当，请各位代表指正。
