Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, April 13th: "People's Unity" published a commentary on the 11th, condemning the Tito clique and Yugoslav newspapers for their malicious attacks on the Republic of Iraq.

　　The commentary said, "Everyone knows very well that Tito made a suspicious visit to the Arab East, especially to the United Arab Republic. His visit took place immediately after the visit of US Assistant Secretary of State Rountree. Everyone also knows that Tito stayed in Syria for a few days before the Shawwaf rebellion. He delivered many speeches, defending Nasser's policy of demanding Arab unity—unity under Nasser's rule. Some facts clearly show that the Yugoslav rulers participated in the imperialist crusade against the Republic of Iraq. In our opinion, this is not accidental, because it is completely consistent with their overall policy."

　　The commentary added, "The Tito clique is the first clique to ally with imperialism under the guise of non-alignment. Under the name of neutrality, the Tito clique constantly slanders the Soviet Union and praises American imperialism. The Tito clique carries out the despicable task of splitting the socialist world and undermining the unity of the international labor movement. At the same time, it is making every effort to influence the national movements of the Asian and African peoples, with the aim of undermining unity through vile slander campaigns against communists and democratic systems. For a long time, it has been trying to create a 'third bloc' among the neutral countries in Asia, which is an imperialist plan aimed at diverting the struggle of the Asian peoples, making them abandon friendship and cooperation with socialist countries, and forming an alliance with imperialism, just as Yugoslavia has actually done."

　　The commentary concluded by saying that the Arab peoples, who resolutely reject imperialist "protection," also resolutely reject Yugoslav "protection." It said, "The Arab people will not buy poison that poisons Arab workers and national movements. The Republic of Iraq is still pursuing a firm and unwavering policy against imperialism, especially American imperialism."

　　伊拉克“人民团结报”发表评论
　　铁托集团为帝国主义卖力
　　竭力破坏亚非人民的反帝斗争
    新华社巴格达13日电　“人民团结报”在11日发表评论，谴责铁托集团和南斯拉夫报纸对伊拉克共和国的恶毒攻击。
    评论说，“大家知道得很清楚，铁托在阿拉伯东方，特别是在阿拉伯联合共和国进行了可疑的访问。他的访问是紧接着美国助理国务卿朗特里的访问之后进行的。大家也知道，铁托就在沙瓦夫叛乱前在叙利亚停留了几天。他发表了很多演说，为纳赛尔要求阿拉伯统一——在纳赛尔统治下的统一——的政策辩护。有些事实清楚地表明，南斯拉夫的统治者参加了帝国主义对伊拉克共和国发动的十字军运动。在我们看来这并不是意外的，因为这和他们的总政策是完全一致的。”
    评论又说，“铁托集团是第一个在不结盟的名义下同帝国主义结盟的集团。铁托集团以中立为名，不断诽谤苏联，对美帝国主义歌功颂德。铁托集团执行分裂社会主义世界和破坏国际劳工运动的团结的卑鄙任务。与此同时，它正在竭力影响亚非人民的民族运动，其目的是要通过对共产党人和民主制度发动的卑劣的诽谤运动来破坏团结。它长期以来竭力在亚洲中立国家中间搞“第三集团”，这是帝国主义的计划，目的是要使亚洲各国人民的斗争转向，使他们放弃同社会主义国家的友谊和合作，而同帝国主义结成同盟，就像南斯拉夫实际上所做的那样。
    评论最后说，坚决拒绝帝国主义“保护”的阿拉伯各国人民同样坚决地拒绝南斯拉夫的“保护”。它说，“阿拉伯人民不会购买毒害阿拉伯工人和民族运动的毒药。伊拉克共和国仍然在执行反对帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的坚定不移的政策。”
