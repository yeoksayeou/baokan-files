    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 13th: A grand rally of more than 2,500 representatives of Communist Party members and laboring people of Shanghai was held tonight to warmly welcome the Italian Communist Party delegation headed by G. Pajetta.

    Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. He said: The powerful Italian Communist Party is the most loyal son of the Italian people. Through long and tortuous struggles, the Italian Communist Party has achieved many brilliant successes in leading the Italian people in the cause of fighting for democracy and social progress. He also said: The Italian Communist Party has made unremitting efforts for the friendly unity between the Italian and Chinese people. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have always been concerned about and sympathetic to the struggle of the Italian Communist Party and the Italian people. Under the current very favorable international situation, the Italian people's cause of striving for peace, democracy, and socialism will surely achieve greater victories.

    In his speech, Head of Delegation G. Pajetta enthusiastically narrated the friendship and concern of the Italian Communist Party and laboring people for the Chinese Communist Party and laboring people. He said: During our visit to China, our deepest impression is that the Chinese Communist Party maintains close ties with the masses of the people, and this connection has never been lost at any time. This is the main source of the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people's socialist construction. He said: Although the Italian bourgeoisie dares not recognize New China, the Italian laboring people deeply understand the glorious history of the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people in long and arduous struggles, and are excited and moved by the victory of New China. G. Pajetta also introduced the Italian Communist Party's arduous struggle against enemies at home and abroad. His speech was often interrupted by applause from the audience.

    Present at today's meeting were Liu Ningyi, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhang Chunqiao and Yang Shifa, members of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    After the meeting, a Peking opera performance was held to entertain the distinguished guests.
