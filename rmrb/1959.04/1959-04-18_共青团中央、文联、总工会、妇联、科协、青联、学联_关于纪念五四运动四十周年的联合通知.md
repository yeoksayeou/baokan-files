The 4th of May this year marks the 40th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. "May Fourth" is the beginning of China's New Democratic Revolution, a glorious memorial day in the history of modern Chinese revolution, and also Chinese Youth Day. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles , the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation , the China Association for science and Technology , the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation jointly call on the broad masses of people and the youth of the country to enthusiastically commemorate this glorious festival, profoundly understand the path to victory of the Chinese people's revolution, inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "May Fourth", and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, unite as one and build our great motherland with greater efforts.

The May Fourth Movement, which broke out in 1919, was a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement. Forty years have passed since the May Fourth Movement. Forty years is only a short period in human history, but the face of our motherland has undergone earth-shaking changes. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have not only completed the historical task of the New Democratic Revolution, but have also basically completed the task of the Socialist Revolution, and have advanced our country into a great new era of building socialism. Now the people of the whole country are striving to turn our country into a strong socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture. This year is a year of continued great leap forward in our country's construction. The people and youth of the whole country should continue to work hard, work practically, and work cleverly to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic development plan.

The Chinese revolutionary movement since "May Fourth" has experienced a difficult and tortuous path. In order to build an independent and prosperous new China, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, carried out a long-term life-and-death struggle against imperialism and domestic reactionaries. Countless revolutionary predecessors went through all kinds of hardships, and countless revolutionary martyrs paid with their blood and heads, finally realizing the lofty ideal of establishing the People's Republic. Now we are holding high the banner of the General Line and advancing at high speed towards the glorious goal of building socialism. The Chinese people, especially the youth of our country, should cherish the revolutionary achievements of the Chinese people a hundredfold, inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, learn from the revolutionary pioneers' revolutionary spirit of "forgetting the family for the country, forgetting the self for the public," work hard, be diligent and thrifty, and fight against difficulties with indomitable will, contributing their wisdom and strength to building socialism.

"May Fourth" is also the glorious festival of the New Culture Enlightenment Movement. The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, national, scientific, and mass cultural revolution that arose from the May Fourth Movement is an important part of China's New Democratic Revolution. In order to build socialism, the Party calls on the people of our country to actively carry out technical revolution and cultural revolution, and to march towards modern culture, science and technology. This is a more magnificent historical task than the "May Fourth" era. The broad masses of workers, peasants and young workers and peasants must persevere and study tenaciously, improve their cultural, scientific and technological level, and strive to realize the intellectualization of workers and peasants. Intellectuals have a very important mission in fulfilling the tasks of technical revolution and cultural revolution. Intellectuals in our country, especially young intellectuals, should continue to adhere to the correct path of combining advanced intellectuals with workers and peasants since the "May Fourth" Movement, combine study with labor, combine book knowledge with the practical experience of workers and peasants, combine individual wisdom with the wisdom of the masses, constantly transform their thinking, improve their scientific and cultural level, and develop into worker-class intellectuals who are both red and expert, so as to better promote the technical revolution and the cultural revolution. The broad masses of young students should continue to implement the Party's policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, study hard, work actively, raise their awareness, and strive to achieve a triple harvest in study, labor, and thinking.

The May Fourth Movement nurtured the great Chinese Communist Party and prepared it ideologically and cadre-wise for its founding. Once the Chinese Communist Party was born, it held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, pointed out a path of complete liberation for the disaster-ridden Chinese people, and led the broad masses of the people in heroic and tenacious struggles. Forty years of history have proved that the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of our country's revolution and construction. The people and youth of our country should strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, closely unite around the Party, work together with one heart and one mind, and build socialism. The youth of our country have always been a heroic fighting force under the leadership of the Party. They should inherit and carry forward this glorious tradition, always listen to the Party, respond to the Party's call, go to the places where the motherland needs them most, go to the most difficult posts, and be a shock brigade in socialist construction.

The May Fourth Movement took place under the influence of the October Revolution. The victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the support of the international proletariat, especially the great assistance of the Soviet Union. The people and youth of our country must carry forward the spirit of internationalism, strive to develop the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, consolidate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and oppose the divisive and destructive activities of the modern revisionists of Yugoslavia. Resolutely support the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations, oppose the imperialist activities of aggression and war plots, and work together with the people of the world to actively safeguard world peace.

In this period of great leap forward in socialist construction, we should carry out activities to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" on a larger scale. Relevant organizations should mobilize their respective organizations at all levels and pay attention to using the power of newspapers, radio stations, publications, and the cultural circles to carry out extensive propaganda. On the eve of "May Fourth," relevant people's organizations in the capital will jointly hold a grand commemorative meeting. Relevant organizations in provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and large and medium-sized cities should also hold corresponding commemorative gatherings. Grassroots units can carry out a variety of educational activities according to actual conditions. We must further stimulate the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of people and youth through welcoming and commemorating the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth," and set off a new high tide of labor and a high tide of learning, and strive to complete and overfulfill the task of continued leap forward in 1959.

　　关于纪念五四运动四十周年的联合通知
    今年5月4日，是五四运动的四十周年。“五四”是我国新民主主义革命的开端，是现代中国革命历史上一个光荣的纪念日，又是中国青年节。共青团中央、中国文联、全国总工会、全国妇联、全国科协、全国青联和全国学联联合号召广大人民和全国青年热烈地纪念这一个光辉的节日，深刻地了解我国人民革命的胜利道路，继承和发扬“五四”的革命精神，在中国共产党的领导下，团结一致，以更大的干劲来建设我们伟大的祖国。
    1919年爆发的五四运动，是一次彻底的反帝反封建的革命运动。五四运动到今天已经四十年，四十年在人类历史上不过是一个短暂的时期，可是我们祖国的面貌却发生了翻天复地的变化。我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，不仅完成了新民主主义革命的历史任务，而且基本上完成了社会主义革命的任务，并且把我国推进到建设社会主义的伟大新时期。现在全国人民正在为把我国建成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国而奋斗。今年是我国建设事业继续大跃进的一年。全国人民和青年应当继续苦干、实干、巧干，争取完成和超额完成1959年的国民经济发展计划。
    “五四”以来的中国革命运动，是经历了艰难和曲折的道路的。中国人民为了建立独立、富强的新中国，在党和毛主席的领导下，同帝国主义和国内反动派进行了长期的你死我活的斗争，无数革命前辈历尽万苦千辛，无数革命先烈付出鲜血和头颅，终于实现了建立人民共和国的崇高理想。现在我们正在高举着总路线的旗帜，高速度地向建成社会主义的辉煌目标迈进。我国人民尤其是我国青年应当百倍地珍惜中国人民的革命成果，继承和发扬中国人民革命斗争的光荣传统，学习革命先驱者那种“国而忘家、公而忘私”的革命精神，艰苦奋斗，克勤克俭，百折不挠地向困难作斗争，为建设社会主义，贡献出自己的智慧和力量。
    “五四”又是新文化启蒙运动的光辉节日。从五四运动兴起的反帝反封建的民族的科学的大众的文化革命，是我国新民主主义革命的重要组成部分。为了建设社会主义，党号召我国人民积极开展技术革命和文化革命，向现代文化和科学技术进军。这是一个比“五四”时代更为宏伟的历史任务。广大工农群众和工农青年要坚持不懈地顽强地学习，提高自己的文化科学技术水平，为实现工农群众知识化而奋斗。知识分子在实现技术革命和文化革命的任务中，负有极重要的使命。我国知识分子尤其是知识青年应该继续坚持“五四”以来我国先进知识分子和工农相结合的正确道路，把学习和劳动结合起来，把书本知识和工农群众的实际经验结合起来，把个人智慧和群众智慧结合起来，不断改造自己的思想，提高自己的科学文化水平，锻炼成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子，更好地促进技术革命和文化革命。广大青年学生要继续贯彻党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，认真读书，积极劳动，提高觉悟，努力做到读书、劳动、思想三丰收。
    五四运动孕育了伟大的中国共产党，为党的成立作了思想上和干部上的准备。中国共产党一经诞生，就高举起马克思列宁主义的旗子，向灾难深重的中国人民指出了一条彻底解放的道路，并领导广大人民进行了英勇顽强的斗争。四十年的历史证明，党的领导是我国革命和建设事业胜利的根本保证。我国人民和青年应该努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作，紧密地团结在党的周围，同心同德，团结一致，建设社会主义。我国青年从来就是党领导下的一支英勇的战斗力量，应当继承和发扬这一光荣传统，永远听党的话，响应党的号召，到祖国最需要的地方去，到最艰难的岗位上去，当好社会主义建设的突击队。
    五四运动是在十月革命的影响下发生的。中国革命的胜利是同国际无产阶级的支援特别是苏联的巨大援助分不开的。我国人民和青年必须发扬国际主义精神，努力发展中苏两国人民的深厚友谊，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，反对南斯拉夫现代修正主义者的分裂破坏活动。坚决支持一切被压迫民族的解放斗争，反对帝国主义的侵略活动和战争阴谋，和全世界人民一道，积极地为维护世界和平而奋斗。
    在这社会主义建设的跃进时期，我们应当以较大的规模，来开展纪念“五四”四十周年的活动。各有关团体应动员所属各级组织并注意运用报刊、电台、出版及文化界的力量，展开广泛的宣传。“五四”前夕，首都各有关人民团体将联合举行盛大的纪念大会。各省、市、自治区和大中城市的有关团体也应举行相应的纪念集会。各基层单位可以根据实际情况，举办多种多样的富有教育意义的活动。我们要通过迎接和纪念“五四”四十周年，进一步激发广大人民和青年的革命热情，掀起一个新的劳动高潮和学习高潮，为完成和超额完成1959年的继续跃进的任务而奋斗。
