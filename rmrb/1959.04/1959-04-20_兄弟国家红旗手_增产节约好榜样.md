Red Banner Pacesetters from Fraternal Countries: Good Examples of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

　　Economy Expert Korchik
    "You are a Communist Party member; we are going to send you to the most difficult mining area." This was the first thing the secretary of the city party committee said to Korchik when he responded to the Party's call and came to Donbass after his discharge from the army. This future miner immediately replied, "I didn't come here to find an easy job."

    From childhood, Korchik's life had never been easy. He was just a child when his father sacrificed his life for the country. At the age of fifteen, he started working and gave his first paycheck to his mother.

    Korchik was assigned to work in the fourth section of the Rutuchenko mine in Donbass, a long-term backward and difficult area. However, as the leader of the team, Korchik was good at mobilizing the masses. He relied on the strength of eight Party members and twenty Communist Youth League members to drive all the work, and in a short period of time, he reversed the backward phenomenon of failing to complete tasks. On this basis, he put forward an advanced slogan to the whole team: "Compete with the nationally known Mamai work team." Because they overcame the backward phenomenon, all the team members were full of confidence in their own strength. Therefore, in a short period of time, they completed the guarantee condition they put forward, that is, each person would overproduce two tons of coal per shift. The guarantee condition was completed, but they did not get the red flag because the task of reducing costs had not been completed. Therefore, Korchik spent a lot of time checking receipts and accounts, and studying the use of every kopeck. A few days later, he convened all the team members and used examples to show how to save. In this way, a new slogan was generated in the whole team: "Save at least one ruble for every ton of coal mined." As a result, they achieved a saving of two rubles.

    Korchik's patriotic initiative quickly developed into a nationwide savings movement. Comrade Khrushchev gave a high evaluation of Korchik's initiative. He said that if the whole country did this, it could save the country 1 billion rubles this year. With these funds, seven coal mines with a total annual output of 4 million tons could be built. He emphasized that "Why is this initiative noteworthy? It shows very well that Soviet people are the real masters of production, and they understand and cherish the interests of the whole people."

　　Good Driver Geflile
    Geflile is a well-known Romanian bus driver who has driven 500,000 kilometers safely. Since Geflile received the new "Skoda" bus in 1951, he has cared for it as much as he loves his three children, never letting the car suffer a little bit. After driving the new car, he quickly achieved 200,000 kilometers and 300,000 kilometers of safe driving without repair. Then, he continued to draw experience in the inspection process and put forward the slogan of "500,000 kilometers of safe driving." When he announced this decision, many of his colleagues were skeptical, but Geflile fulfilled his promise and saved wealth for the country. How did Geflile, who has been driving a car for 30 years, achieve this achievement? Listen to what he said:

    "Before liberation, drivers were like the wheels of a truck, just turning without a soul. Although I am an old hand at driving, I didn't understand that driving is also an art until after liberation. How do I maintain the car? I never let it lack water or oil. I also never drive recklessly. I not only check the engine at every stop, but also listen carefully to its beat like a doctor listening to a patient's pulse, and prevent any failures in time. Secondly, I also try not to replace a single original part, so as to achieve a lot of savings. From the quality of the engine oil to the weight and placement of passengers' luggage on the roof, I have to make careful inspections. In this way, I can achieve 500,000 kilometers of safe driving..."

　　Worker Inventor Nguyen Hung Minh
    Not long ago, good news came from the transportation department of the Vietnamese People's Army that worker Nguyen Hung Minh successfully started the internal combustion engine of a car with diesel instead of gasoline.

    Nguyen Hung Minh is 42 years old this year. At the age of 14, he worked as an apprentice in a French colonial car company in Saigon. Under the exploitation of the colonialists, he sold 20 years of labor. Since joining the revolution in 1934, he has been arrested twice, suffered torture, and lost his right hand in a battle.

    When this tried and tested man came to work in the transportation department of the People's Army, he saw that many vehicles needed gasoline, which was a huge waste. Therefore, he was always thinking: "If diesel could be used instead of gasoline, it would save a lot of wealth for the country and speed up the construction and unification of the motherland." His idea was strongly supported by the Party. So Nguyen Hung Minh used his spare time to run around, exchange opinions with experienced workers, and consult with some comrades from the Industrial University. He installed some car parts in an internal combustion engine that runs on gasoline, and then used diesel to run it. After many experiments, it was finally successful. Not long ago, the first three-ton truck powered by diesel was galloping across the fields of Vietnam. The car traveled more than 300 kilometers, climbing mountains and crossing ridges, without any abnormal phenomena. According to preliminary test results, diesel can be used one-third less than gasoline, and diesel is also half the price of gasoline. At the same time, it can be produced in large quantities in Vietnam.

　　兄弟国家红旗手　增产节约好榜样
　　节约能手科尔奇克
    “您是共产党员，我们要派您到最困难的煤矿区段去。”这是科尔奇克退伍后，响应党的号召来到顿巴斯时，市委书记对他讲的第一句话。这位未来的矿工当即回答说：“我本来就不是为了找轻松的工作才到这儿来的。”
    从小时候起，科尔奇克的生活就没有轻松过。当他父亲为祖国作战牺牲时，他还是个小孩子。十五岁那年，他就开始工作了，并把生平第一次领到的工资交给母亲。
    科尔奇克被派到顿巴斯鲁图京矿第四区段去工作，那里是个长期落后、困难重重的地方。但是，作为队长的科尔奇克善于发动群众，他依靠了八名党员和二十名共青团员的力量带动一切工作，在很短期间就扭转了完不成任务的落后现象。在这个基础上他又向全队提出了先进的口号：“同全国知名的马马依工作队较量一下”，由于克服了落后现象，全体队员对自己的力量充满了信心，所以在短期内他们就完成了提出的保证条件，即每班每人超额生产两吨煤。保证条件完成了，但是他们却没得到红旗，因为降低成本的任务还没完成。于是，科尔奇克花了很多时间检查了单据和账目，研究了每一戈比的用途，几天后他又召集全队人员，用实例证明怎样节约。这样，全队就产生了一个新口号：“每采一吨煤，至少节约一个卢布”，结果他们达到了节约两个卢布的成绩。
    科尔奇克工作队的爱国主义创举很快发展成为全国性节约运动。赫鲁晓夫同志对科尔奇克的创议给予很高的评价。他说，如果全国都照这样作，今年就可为国家节省十亿卢布，用这些资金，可以建设七座年产总量为四百万吨的煤矿。他强调指出“这个创议为什么值得注意呢？它很好地表明，苏维埃人是生产的真正主人，他们懂得并珍惜全民利益。”

　　好司机格弗利勒
    格弗利勒，是全罗马尼亚闻名的安全行车五十万公里的汽车司机。自从1951年格弗利勒领到了新的“斯戈达”牌公共汽车后，他就像爱他的三个孩子一样爱护它，从不让车子受一点委屈。开上新车，他很快就实现了二十万、三十万公里安全行车，不用修理。接着，他在检修过程中不断吸取了经验，又提出了“安全行车五十万公里”的口号。当他宣布这个决定时，他的很多同行都抱着怀疑的态度，可是格弗利勒实现了自己的诺言，为国家节省了财富。开了三十年汽车的格弗利勒怎样取得了这个成就呢？请听听他自己讲的话：
    “解放以前，开车的人就像卡车的轮子，只是转而没有灵魂，我虽然是个开车的老行家，可是直到解放后才明白开车也是门艺术。我是怎样保养汽车的呢？我从来没使它缺水、缺油。我也从不蛮开，我不但每站检查发动机，而且一路上像医生听病人的脉搏一样地仔细听它的跳动，及时防止任何故障。其次，我也尽量不换一个原配件，因此作到了大量节约。从机油的质量到车顶旅客行李的重量和放置位置，我都要作仔细的检查。这样，我才能实现五十万公里安全行车……”

　　工人发明家阮雄明
    不久以前，从越南人民军运输部门传来了工人阮雄明用柴油代替汽油很好地开动汽车内燃机成功的喜讯。
    阮雄明今年四十二岁了，他十四岁就在西贡法国殖民者的汽车公司里当学徒，在殖民者的压榨下他出卖了二十年的劳动力。自从1934年参加革命后，他曾两次被捕，受尽折磨，并在一次战役中失去了右手。
    当这个经过千锤百炼的人来到人民军运输部工作以后，他看到很多车辆都要汽油，耗费巨大，因此他总是在想：“如果能用柴油代替汽油，将给国家节省大量财富，并会加快祖国的建设和统一。”他的想法得到党的大力支持。于是阮雄明就利用业余时间，到处奔跑，同有经验的工人交换意见，向工业大学的一些同志请教。他把一部分汽车零件安装在用汽油开动的内燃机里，然后用柴油来开动。经过多次的试验，终于成功了。不久以前，第一部柴油开动的载重三吨的汽车奔驰在越南的原野上，汽车走了三百多公里，爬山越岭，没发生任何不正常的现象。据初步试验结果，用柴油可以比汽油少三分之一，而且柴油又比汽油便宜一半。同时，越南国内可以大量生产。
