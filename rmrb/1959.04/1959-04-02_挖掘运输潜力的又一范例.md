    Another Example of Tapping Transportation Potential

    Under the unified leadership of the CPC Fuxin Municipal Committee, Fuxin Station implemented road-mine cooperation, launched a high-yield movement in railway transportation, and achieved remarkable results, thus winning the glorious title of National Coal Transportation Red Flag Station. This fact once again powerfully proves that greatly promoting the communist spirit of cooperation between departments and between enterprises has a great effect on the development of production and transportation.

    This year, due to the rapid development of various construction undertakings in our country, not only is the railway transportation task unprecedentedly heavy, but also the road and water transportation tasks are equally heavy; not only is long-distance transportation feeling the shortage of transportation capacity, but short-distance transportation is also very busy. To fulfill and overfulfill this year's transportation tasks, on the one hand, we certainly need to vigorously build railway double lines and new lines, and vigorously increase locomotives, vehicles, and ship barges and other transportation tools, but at present, an important aspect that can produce immediate results is to strengthen cooperation, organize rational transportation, and fully tap transportation potential.

    Not long ago, the advanced experience of "regional grain production and sales balance and rational transportation" created by the staff of the grain department, which was introduced by the State Economic Commission, is a good example of tapping potential and saving the country's transportation capacity. The advantage of this experience is that it eliminates unreasonable phenomena such as counter-current, repetitive, and roundabout transportation of materials, greatly alleviating the tense situation in grain transportation, and also saving the country a large amount of freight. Now, Fuxin Station has provided us with another advanced experience in tapping transportation potential. The characteristic of Fuxin's experience is road-mine cooperation, achieving fast loading, fast unloading, and fast transportation, shortening the dwell time of freight cars at the station, thereby greatly increasing transportation capacity.

    From a national perspective, there are more than 30 stations like Fuxin that are located in key coal mining areas and steel enterprise factory areas. If these stations, like Fuxin, implement large-scale cooperation between factories, mines, and railway transportation departments, then the transportation capacity currently serving key enterprises can be greatly increased. According to preliminary calculations by the Ministry of Railways, as long as the average dwell time of freight cars in the national railway transportation sector is shortened by half an hour, it is equivalent to increasing the transportation capacity of 1,400 freight cars for the country. Judging from the achievements made by Fuxin Station in February and March, this potential may be much greater than expected. Therefore, attaching importance to and promoting the experience of Fuxin Station is of great significance for ensuring key projects, realizing the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, and comprehensively completing this year's production tasks.

### 挖掘运输潜力的又一范例

    挖掘运输潜力的又一范例
    阜新车站在中共阜新市委统一领导下，实行路矿协作，开展铁路运输高产运动，取得了显著成绩，并因此获得全国煤炭运输红旗车站的光荣称号。这个事实又一次有力地证明：在部门与部门，企业与企业之间，大大发扬共产主义的协作精神，对发展生产和交通运输有着很大作用。
    今年，由于我们国家各项建设事业的飞跃发展，不仅铁路运输任务空前繁重，公路和水路运输任务也一样的繁重；不仅长途运输感到运力不足，短途运输更是十分繁忙。要完成和超额完成今年的运输任务，一方面固然需要我们大力修建铁路复线、新线，大力增加机车车辆和船驳等运输工具，但在当前，能够立竿见影的一个重要方面，却在于加强协作，组织合理运输，充分挖掘运输潜力。
    不久前，国家经济委员会介绍过的粮食部门职工所创造的“粮食分区产销平衡合理运输”的先进经验，就是一个挖掘潜力、节省国家运输力的良好例子。这个经验的好处是消灭了物资运输对流、重复、迂回等不合理现象，大大缓和了粮食运输方面的紧张状况，还为国家节省大批运费。现在，阜新车站又为我们提供了另一个挖掘运输潜力的先进经验。阜新这项经验的特点是路矿协作，做到快装、快卸、快运，缩短货车在车站的停留时间，从而大大提高运输力。
    从全国来看，像阜新那样位于重点煤矿区和钢铁企业厂区的车站就有三十多个，如果这些车站都像阜新那样，实行厂矿企业和铁路运输部门的大协作，那么，目前服务于重点企业的运输力就可以增加很多。据铁道部初步计算，只要把全国铁路运输方面的货车车辆的停留时间平均缩短半小时，就等于为国家增加一千四百辆货车的运力。从阜新车站2、3月份所取得的成就看来，这种潜力比预计的可能还要大得多。因此，重视和推广阜新车站的经验，对保证重点，实现钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标和全面地完成今年生产任务，有着重要的意义。
