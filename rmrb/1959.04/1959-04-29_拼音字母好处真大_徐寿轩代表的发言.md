Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully support the government work report made by Premier Zhou Enlai, the report on the draft national economic plan for 1959 made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the report on the 1958 state final accounts and the 1959 state budget draft made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

I will now give a brief speech on the work of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet and the promotion of Putonghua in Jilin Province.

It is of great significance to carry out the work of reforming the writing system in our country. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report "The Current Tasks of Writing Reform" at the meeting held by the National Committee of the CPPCC on January 10, 1958: "Writing reform is a major event related to the people of the whole country,... I hope everyone will actively support the work of writing reform, promote this work, and not 'hinder' this work, so that Chinese characters can be reformed steadily and actively, so as to meet the needs of 600 million people to get rid of cultural backwardness and to meet the needs of developing socialist cause in a multi-faceted, fast, good and economical way." The practice of writing reform in our province in the past few years has fully confirmed that Premier Zhou's report is correct. Promoting writing reform is a historical task given to us by the objective situation. Conversely, the promotion of writing reform has promoted the development of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution to a certain extent, and accelerated socialist construction. From the current situation in our Jilin Province, promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet and promoting Putonghua among the whole people are not only of far-reaching significance but also of urgent practical significance.

Pinyin Scheme Promoted Rapidly

In 1958, the work of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and the work of promoting Putonghua in our province, like other brother provinces and cities in the country, entered a new stage. The characteristics of the work are fast progress and wide scope. These characteristics were not seen in previous years. There are many reasons why the work of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and promoting Putonghua in our province could have made great progress in 1958. The first is the importance attached by the Party, and the second is the promotion of the leap-forward development of the socialist construction cause in our country. In 1958, our province, like other regions in the country, also saw a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and realized the people's commune. The new situation brought new historical tasks to the cultural and educational work in our province, that is, how to improve the cultural level of the people of the province, especially the broad masses of workers and peasants, faster and better. Under this circumstance, our province timely, actively and steadily promoted the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and promoted Putonghua throughout the province. At that time, our province was in a tense period of mass steelmaking and large-scale autumn ploughing. It seems that it would be difficult to arrange the work of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and promoting Putonghua in such a tense period. However, because the broad masses of workers and peasants realized that they must have a certain culture to master technology, and learning the phonetic alphabet can help them learn culture faster and better; and in order to facilitate the exchange of production experience with brother provinces and cities, it is also necessary to learn Putonghua well. Therefore, the work of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and promoting Putonghua during this period was welcomed by the masses, progressed rapidly, and achieved relatively significant results.

The broad masses of workers and peasants have deeply experienced the benefits of learning the phonetic alphabet in practice. The members of the Wanjinta People's Commune in Nong'an County, Jilin Province, learned the phonetic alphabet, quickly got rid of illiteracy, and then wrote poems to sing the praises of the phonetic alphabet:

"Pinyin letters, benefits are great;
Conducive to literacy, improve culture;
Unify language, speak Mandarin;
Work together to build the country."

Liu Huan'an, a member of the commune who got rid of illiteracy, wrote such a poem for the first time with his own hands after learning the phonetic alphabet:

"I, Liu Huan'an, a big roughneck, haven't studied for more than forty years,
Devoted to learning culture, phonetic alphabet is the foundation.
Iron tree blooms with lush branches and leaves, people read books at half a century old,
The more I think about it, the brighter my heart becomes, and I will never suffer from illiteracy again."

After getting rid of illiteracy, the broad masses of workers and peasants were not satisfied with the achievements they had made, but demanded to continue to improve. They said: "Mechanization and electrification, nothing can be done without culture; getting rid of illiteracy is not the end, production and learning go hand in hand." Under the control of this kind of mood, the masses of workers and peasants went into red and expert schools and spare-time cultural schools to improve their cultural, technical, and political levels. As a result, many new people and new things appeared in the mass movement of tool reform. Meng Xianwu, an ordinary carpenter in Yushu County, created a soybean cake cutting knife, which increased the work efficiency by more than ten times. The rolling bearing lathe made by the farmers in the Minquan Management District of the county increased from less than twenty sets per day in the past to eighty sets. Of course, it is not to say that all the achievements made by the masses of workers and peasants in the tool reform movement should be attributed to the phonetic alphabet, but the fact that the masses of workers and peasants have learned the phonetic alphabet has indeed provided them with good conditions for further improving their culture and making inventions.

Pinyin Letters Have Many Benefits

Promoting the phonetic alphabet can not only help adults eliminate illiteracy, but also greatly improve the effect of language teaching in schools, especially in primary schools. Primary school students who are seven or eight years old can read popular juvenile phonetic reading materials after learning the phonetic alphabet for less than half a year after entering school. Mo Ziming, an eight-year-old from Changtong Road Primary School in Changchun City, also wrote a letter to Chairman Mao in phonetic alphabet. In the past, primary school students started learning Chinese characters when they entered school, and it was impossible to write letters after studying for one year.

The work of promoting Putonghua in our province started in 1955. At that time, many people did not have enough understanding of the importance of learning Putonghua, and mistakenly believed that the Jilin pronunciation and the Putonghua pronunciation were "almost the same", and it didn't matter whether they learned Putonghua or not. However, the practice of life in the past few years has confirmed that there are still some differences between Jilin pronunciation and Putonghua pronunciation, and thus gradually aroused people's widespread attention to learning Putonghua. From the overall situation of this work, thanks to the correct leadership and care of the Central Government, great achievements have been made in the past few years, but there are still many problems to be solved urgently. The progress of the work has ups and downs. It was greatly developed in 1956, and the work was not greatly developed in 1957 due to various reasons. In 1958, it entered a new stage of development. The scope of the work is gradually expanding, from a small number of people to middle and primary school teachers, students, and even the broad masses of workers and peasants.

Up to now, according to incomplete statistics, about 80% or more of the middle and primary school teachers in our province have learned the phonetic alphabet, and most of them can use Putonghua to teach. In middle and primary schools, most of the young students have not only learned the phonetic alphabet, but many of them can basically speak Putonghua in their daily study and life. In order to carry out the work of promoting Putonghua in depth, all cities and counties in the province have trained a large number of lecturers, instructors, people's teachers and activists in batches since 1955. In Liaoyuan City alone, since the provincial oath-taking meeting for the promotion of Putonghua in November 1958, ten Putonghua phonetic training classes have been held in less than three months, training nearly one thousand lecturers and backbone forces for all strata and departments in the city (middle and primary school teachers, school leaders, cadres of the municipal people's committee, cadres of factories and mines, full-time teachers of spare-time schools, officers and soldiers of the army, and cultural and artistic workers).

From the current point of view, the work of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme in our province is more needed than the work of promoting Putonghua. In 1958, our province made great achievements in eliminating illiteracy. It basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people before the National Day last year and became a province without illiteracy. However, according to later investigations, there has been a "resurrection" phenomenon among the students who have already eliminated illiteracy. The "resurrection" rate is about 25%. In addition, there are more than 400,000 illiterate and semi-illiterate people in our province who need to be eliminated. It seems that the task of eliminating illiteracy is still very heavy. How to quickly and thoroughly complete the task of eliminating illiteracy in the future, to make the "resurrected" people "familiar" again, to consolidate those who have gotten rid of illiteracy, and to get further improvement, and to continue to eliminate the remaining illiteracy, is a problem to be solved urgently at present. In order to complete the above tasks, we must resort to the phonetic alphabet. Therefore, our province has successively carried out pilot work on phonetic literacy (that is, using phonetic alphabet to annotate Chinese characters to help eliminate illiteracy) in several counties such as Nong'an, Yushu, and Da'an in the winter of 1958 and the spring of 1959. The pilot work included seven work areas, a town people's commune, a production team, and three workshops. The total number of people participating in the study was about 4,000. Most of them were young and middle-aged illiterate and semi-illiterate people, and a small number were literacy graduates who needed consolidation.

Phonetic Literacy Has Great Effect

From the pilot situation of phonetic literacy in our province, the effect is very great and there are many benefits.

First, the phonetic alphabet is not difficult to learn, and the masses of workers and peasants can learn it quickly. After ten days, twenty-one lessons, twenty tutoring sessions, and thirty self-study sessions, the people's teachers participating in the study in the Yushu County People's Teacher Training Class basically mastered the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, reached four abilities (can recognize, can read, can spell, can write), and obtained some basic theoretical knowledge. The test results were eleven people with five points, seventeen people with four points, seven people with three points, and all passed. A production team of Ping'anbao Management District of Wanjinta People's Commune in Nong'an County had twenty-five members participating in the study. After a short five-day assault, more than 25% of the people reached four abilities, and most of the rest could basically recognize and read the phonetic alphabet.

Second, the phonetic alphabet can effectively consolidate and improve the achievements of literacy and expand the scope of literacy. The pilot of phonetic literacy in Wanjinta People's Commune in Nong'an County quickly expanded from the initial twenty-five people to more than seven hundred people. Most of them were remaining illiterate people, and a small number were "resurrected" people, and they all quickly got rid of illiteracy. The commune also launched a movement to "read hundreds of books and write thousands of poems" on the basis of the victory of literacy. At the poetry competition, the literacy students spoke eloquently, and the commune members wrote 208 poems before and after the poetry competition.

Third, the masses of workers and peasants welcome the phonetic alphabet. Although there were ideological obstacles when they first started learning, such as calling the phonetic alphabet "foreign language" and saying "the twists and turns are not easy to learn, and I feel confused when I see it." But after propaganda and education, they realized the benefits of learning the phonetic alphabet, and their enthusiasm for learning was very high, squeezing time to learn and rushing time to practice. During production breaks, they used their fingers as pens and grain piles as paper, and when eating, they used chopsticks as pens and wrote on the table. The old man said: "Don't look at my old age, my memory is not bad, you young people can't pull me down." Some commune members expressed their determination with big-character posters, saying: "The sound of the mountains and rivers is rushing, the illiterate's heart is in a mess. The Party's leadership is really good, so that I am not blind. Everyone learns the twisted characters, and everyone speaks Putonghua. Make up your mind to study hard and strive to be the first family to get rid of illiteracy."

Fourth, the phonetic alphabet can help learn Putonghua. Although the pilot work of phonetic literacy in several counties in our province did not put forward clear requirements for learning Putonghua, because they used the phonetic alphabet to learn characters, they also corrected many local accents. For example, some people used to pronounce learning (Xüe) as Xiao, but now it has been corrected.

The work of phonetic literacy is still in the pilot stage in our province, but from the pilot situation, it can be completely affirmed that there are many benefits, and it should be vigorously promoted in the future.

In our province in 1958, the places where the work of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and promoting Putonghua were successful have these characteristics: First, they combined with the central work arranged by the Party, coordinated production tasks, unified consideration, and comprehensive arrangements. The pilot work of phonetic literacy in Yushu County in our province was carried out in the context of mass accumulation of fertilizer and preparation for farming. The upsurge of promoting Putonghua in middle and primary schools in Jiaohe County was also set off in the context of mass steelmaking. Of course, this is not to say that it is possible to do this under any circumstances. But in general, as long as conditions permit, actively grasp the work, comprehensively consider and make unified arrangements, the work of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and promoting Putonghua can be arranged, and it is possible to achieve "two nothings missed" and "double harvest" in production and learning. The second is in-depth propaganda and mobilizing the masses. Because promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and promoting Putonghua is a new work, although most of the masses are willing to learn, it is also necessary to conduct in-depth propaganda to the masses, to explain the purpose, significance and benefits of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and promoting Putonghua clearly, to eliminate various misunderstandings and doubts of the masses, and to fully mobilize the masses. Last year, many cities and counties in our province carried out activities such as "Propaganda Month", "Propaganda Week", and "Leap Forward Oath-taking Conference" to carry out propaganda and mobilization. Some also adopted methods such as large-scale singing, large-scale blooming, big-character posters, and wall poems to mobilize the masses, which have achieved good results.

The work of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and promoting Putonghua in our province is not enough, and compared with the requirements of the state and the speed of the development of the entire cause, there is still a big gap. The above-mentioned achievements are also inseparable from the correct leadership and cordial care of the Central Government. From 1955 to 1958, the Central Government sent people to our province several times to help carry out the work. In particular, in October 1958, Wu Yu Lao personally came to our province to inspect the work and gave important instructions on the work of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and promoting Putonghua in our province, which gave us great inspiration and promotion, so that this work in our province has been further developed.

According to the requirements of the state, we have conducted a relatively comprehensive study of the work of promoting the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and promoting Putonghua in our province in the past few years. On this basis, we have put forward the tasks for our province in the future, and we will strive to basically popularize the phonetic alphabet and Putonghua among the people of our province in two or three years or more. Now we are drafting feasible specific plans in order to thoroughly complete this task.

Of course, it is not an easy thing to complete such a task, and we can fully estimate that there will be many difficulties on the road ahead. But we firmly believe that as long as we rely on the leadership of the Party and fully mobilize the masses, any difficulties can be overcome. Our task will surely be successfully realized.

We firmly believe that with the high-speed development of the entire socialist construction cause, the completion of China's writing reform is not a distant thing. The realization of the great ideal of the liberated 600 million Chinese people to completely get rid of cultural backwardness is also not far away. Let us work together and strive to achieve this noble goal!

专栏：

    拼音字母好处真大
    徐寿轩代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告、李富春副总理所作的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理所作的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告和彭真副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    我现在就吉林省推行汉语拼音方案和推行普通话的工作情况作一简要的发言。
    在我国进行文字改革工作是有重大意义的。周总理一九五八年一月十日在政协全国委员会举行的报告会上所作“当前文字改革的任务”这个报告中指出：“文字改革是关系到全国人民的一件大事，……希望大家积极支持文字改革工作，促进这一工作，而不要“促退”这一工作，好使中国文字能够稳步地而又积极地得到改革，以适应六亿人民摆脱文化落后状态的需要，以适应多、快、好、省地发展社会主义事业的需要。”几年来，我省文字改革工作的实践完全证实了周总理的报告是正确的。推行文字改革是客观形势给我们提出的历史任务，反过来文字改革工作的推行又在一定程度上促进了技术革命和文化革命的发展，加速了社会主义建设。从当前我们吉林省情况来看，在全民中推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话，不仅有深远意义，而且有着迫切的现实意义。
    拼音方案迅速推广
    一九五八年我省推行汉语拼音方案的工作和推广普通话的工作同全国兄弟省、市同样进入了一个新的阶段。工作的特点是进度快、范围广。这种特点是往年所没有的。一九五八年我省推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话的工作所以能有很大的发展，其原因是很多的，首先是党的重视，其次是我国的社会主义建设事业飞跃发展的推动。一九五八年，我省也和全国其他地区同样出现了工农业生产大跃进，实现了人民公社化。新的形势给我省文教工作带来了新的历史任务，那就是如何更快、更好地提高全省人民特别是广大工农群众的文化水平。在这种情况下，我省及时地、积极稳步地在全省范围内推行了汉语拼音方案和推广了普通话。当时我省正处于全民大炼钢铁、大搞秋翻地的紧张时期。看来，在这样的紧张时期，再安排推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话的工作好像是有困难的。但是，由于广大工农群众认识到了要掌握技术必须有一定的文化，而学会拼音字母就能更快、更好地学习文化；并且为了便于和兄弟省、市交流生产经验，也有学好普通话的必要。因此，这一时期推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话的工作，受到了群众的欢迎，进展较快，收效较为显著。
    广大工农群众在实践中已经深刻地体验到学习拼音字母的好处。我省农安县万金塔人民公社的社员学会了拼音字母，很快地摆脱文盲后，他们写作诗歌来歌唱拼音字母：
    “拼音字母，好处真大；
    有利扫盲，提高文化；
    统一语言，说普通话；
    齐心努力，建设国家。”
    该社脱离文盲的社员刘焕安，学会了拼音字母之后，第一次用自己的手写出了这样一首诗：
    “我刘焕安大老粗，四十多年没念书，
    一心一意学文化，拼音字母打基础。
    铁树开花枝叶茂，人活半百把书读，
    越思越想心越亮，再也不吃文盲苦。”
    广大的工农群众在脱离文盲后，并不满足已得的成绩，而是要求继续提高。他们说：“机械化、电气化，没有文化啥也不能化；脱了盲不算完，生产学习齐向前。”工农群众就是在这种心情支配下，又走进了红专学校、业余文化学校，去提高文化、技术、政治水平。从而在大闹工具改革运动中出现了很多新人新事。榆树县一个普通木工孟宪武创制了豆饼切削刀，提高了工作效率十多倍。该县民权管理区农民自制的滚珠轴承旋床，由过去日产不足二十套，提高到八十套。当然不是说要把工农群众在工具改革运动中所取得的成绩，都归功于拼音字母，但是工农群众学会了拼音字母的确为他们进一步提高文化、发明创造，提供了良好的条件。
    拼音字母好处很多
    推行拼音字母，不仅在成年人中能够帮助扫除文盲，而且在学校中，特别是在小学中也能大大地提高语文教学的效果。七、八周岁的小学生入学不到半年，先学会拼音字母，就可以阅读通俗的少年注音读物。长春市长通路小学八周岁的莫子明，还用拼音字母给毛主席写了一封信。过去小学生入学从学汉字学起，学习一年就能写信是作不到的。
    我省推广普通话的工作是从一九五五年开始的。当时有不少的人对于学习普通话的重要意义认识不足，错误地认为吉林语音和普通话语音“差不多”，学不学普通话都无关紧要。但是，几年来的生活实践证实了吉林语音和普通话语音还是有些差别的，因而逐渐地引起了人们对于学习普通话的广泛注意。从这一工作总的情况来看，由于中央的正确领导和关怀，几年来的成绩是很大的，但是目前也还存在不少急待解决的问题。工作的进展是有起伏的，一九五六年曾有很大开展，一九五七年由于多方面的原因工作开展不大，一九五八年进入了一个新的发展阶段。工作的范围是逐渐扩大的，由少数人发展到中、小学教师、学生，以至广大的工农群众。
    到目前为止，据不完全的统计，我省大约有百分之八十以上的中、小学教师学会了拼音字母，其中大多数人能使用普通话教学。在中、小学中，多数的青少年学生不仅学会了拼音字母，而且其中的不少人在日常的学习和生活中也基本上能说普通话了。全省各市、县为了深入开展推广普通话的工作，从一九五五年起，先后分期分批地培训了大量的讲师、辅导员、民师和积极分子。仅辽源市一市，从一九五八年十一月全省推广普通话誓师大会后，在不到三个月的时间内，就举办了十期普通话语音训练班，为市内各阶层、各部门（中、小学教师、学校领导干部、市人委机关干部、厂矿干部、业余学校专职教师、部队官兵、文化艺术工作者）培养了将近一千名的讲师和骨干力量。
    就目前来看，我省推行汉语拼音方案工作比推广普通话工作更为需要。一九五八年我省的扫盲工作取得了很大成绩，在去年国庆节前基本上扫除了青壮年文盲，成为无文盲省。但据后来调查，在已经扫除文盲的学员中出现了“回生”现象。“回生”率大约占百分之二十五左右。此外，我省还有四十余万文盲、半文盲，尚待扫除。看起来扫盲的任务还是很大的。如何在今后迅速彻底完成扫盲任务，“回生”的使它“回熟”，脱离文盲的使它巩固，并且得到进一步的提高，剩余的文盲继续扫除，这是当前急待解决的问题。为了完成上述任务，必须借助于拼音字母。因此，我省于一九五八年冬季、一九五九年春季曾先后在农安、榆树、大安等几个县进行了注音扫盲（即用拼音字母给汉字注音来帮助扫盲）的试点工作。试点工作包括七个作业区、一个城镇人民公社、一个生产队、三个车间。参加学习的人数总计有四千人左右。其中大部分人是青壮年文盲、半文盲，小部分是扫盲毕业而需要巩固的。
    注音扫盲效果很大
    从我省的注音扫盲试点情况来看，效果是很大的，好处是很多的。
    第一，拼音字母不难学，工农群众可以很快学会。榆树县民师训练班，经过十天二十一节正课、二十节辅导、三十节自习，参加学习的民师就基本上掌握了汉语拼音方案，达到了四会（会认、会读、会拼、会写），并获得了一些基本理论知识。测验结果得五分的十一人，四分的十七人，三分的七人，全部及格。农安县万金塔人民公社平安堡管理区一个生产队有二十五名社员参加学习。经过短短五天突击，就有百分之二十五以上的人达到了四会，其余大部分人也基本上能认、能读拼音字母了。
    第二，拼音字母能够有效地巩固、提高扫盲成果，扩大识字范围。农安县万金塔人民公社的注音扫盲试点，由最初的二十五人很快地扩大到七百多人。其中大部分是剩余文盲，小部分是“回生”的，都很快摆脱了文盲。该社并在扫盲胜利的基础上，掀起了“读百本书、写千篇诗”的运动。在赛诗会上脱盲学员出口成章，仅在赛诗会的前后该社社员们就写出了二百零八首诗歌。
    第三，工农群众对拼音字母是欢迎的。虽然刚开始学习时也有思想障碍，比如把拼音字母叫“洋文”，说“弯弯曲曲不好学，一看心里就糊涂”。但是经过宣传教育，他们认识到了学习拼音字母的好处后，学习的热情是很高的，挤时间学，抢时间练。生产休息时他们把手指当笔，谷堆当纸，吃饭时他们把筷头子当笔，在桌面上写字。老头子说：“别看我的年岁大，记性可不差，你们小伙子拉不下。”有的社员用大字报表示决心说：“高山流水响哗哗，文盲心里乱如麻。党的领导实在好，让我不当睁眼瞎。人人学习弯弯字，个个都说普通话。下定决心苦学习，争取脱盲第一家。”
    第四，拼音字母可以帮助学习普通话。我省几个县的注音扫盲试点工作，虽然对学习普通话并没有提出明确的要求，但是由于用拼音字母识字，所以也纠正了不少方音，例如过去有一部分人把学（Xüe）读成Xiao，现在纠正过来了。
    注音扫盲工作在我省还处于试点阶段，但是从试点的情况来看，完全可以肯定好处是很多的，今后应该大力提倡。
    我省一九五八年凡是推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话工作有成绩的地方，他们的工作都有这样几个特点：首先是结合党所安排的中心工作，配合生产任务、统一考虑、全面安排。我省榆树县的注音扫盲试点工作就是在大搞积肥和备耕的情况下进行的。蛟河县中、小学的推广普通话高潮也是在大炼钢铁的情况下掀起来的。当然，这不是说在任何情况下这样做都是可能的。但是在一般的情况下，只要条件允许，积极抓紧工作，全面考虑和统一安排，推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话的工作是可以安排上去的，也是可以做到生产学习“两不误”，“双丰收”的。其次是深入宣传，发动群众。因为推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话是一项新的工作，虽然大多数群众是愿意学的，但是也必须向群众进行深入宣传，把推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话的目的、意义和好处说清楚，消除群众的各种误解和怀疑，才能把群众充分地发动起来。我省不少市、县去年开展了“宣传月”、“宣传周”、“跃进誓师大会”等活动，进行宣传鼓动，有的还采取了大鸣、大放、大字报、墙头诗等办法发动群众，都收到很好的效果。
    我省推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话的工作是做得很不够的，同国家的要求和整个事业发展的速度相比，还是有很大距离的。上面提到的点滴成绩的取得，也是同中央的正确领导和亲切关怀分不开的。从一九五五年到一九五八年，中央曾几次派人到我省帮助开展工作，特别是一九五八年十月吴玉老亲自到我省视察工作，对我省推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话的工作作了重要指示，给我们很大的启示和推动，使得我省这一工作有了进一步的开展。
    根据国家的要求，我们对我省几年来推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话的工作情况，进行了比较全面的研究。在这个基础上，我们提出了我省今后的任务，要力争在二、三年或者再多一些时间内，在我省全民中基本上普及拼音字母和普通话。现在我们正在拟具切实可行的具体规划，以期彻底完成这一个任务。
    当然要完成这样一个任务不是一件容易的事情，我们完全可以估计到在前进的道路上困难一定是很多的。但是我们坚信，只要依靠党的领导，把群众充分地发动起来，任何困难都是可以克服的。我们的任务一定能胜利实现。
    我们坚决的相信，随着整个社会主义建设事业的高速度发展，中国的文字改革的完成，不是很遥远的事了。解放了的六亿中国人民彻底摆脱文化落后的伟大理想的实现，也为期不远了。让我们为达到这一崇高的目的而共同努力奋斗吧！
