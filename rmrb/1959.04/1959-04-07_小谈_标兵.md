	A Brief Discussion on "Pacesetters"

	Establishing "pacesetters" and organizing socialist labor emulation drives within enterprises play a significant role in harnessing the production enthusiasm of the workers, increasing labor productivity, and ensuring the completion of production plans.

	The so-called "pacesetter" is an advanced model that can play a demonstrative role. Conducting pacesetter competitions in factories and enterprises is more specific, clear, detailed, and vivid than general appeals and broad mobilizations, and it has a stronger power of persuasion and attraction. Focusing on production teams as key "pacesetters" in the process of establishing "pacesetters" at all levels is a good approach. The production team is the basic organizational unit of an enterprise and also a management unit. Improving labor productivity, reducing costs, and saving raw materials are all closely related to the activities of the production team. Establishing team "pacesetters" facilitates the promotion of the collective spirit of the broad masses and the communist style of mutual assistance and cooperation.

	After "pacesetters" are established, the leader's responsibility lies in how to rapidly bring the individual or small number of advanced factors into widespread effect, and in this development process, discover more positive factors, improve further, and develop forward.

    小谈“标兵”
    树立“标兵”，组织企业内部的社会主义劳动竞赛，对于发挥职工群众的生产积极性，提高劳动生产率，保证生产计划的完成有极大作用。
    所谓“标兵”，就是能够发挥示范作用的先进典型。在工厂企业中开展标兵赛，比一般号召、泛泛动员的领导方法更加具体、明确、细致、生动，有更加强烈的说服力和吸引力。在层层树立“标兵”当中把生产小组为重点“标兵”，这是一个好的作法。生产小组是企业的基层组织，又是管理单位。提高劳动生产率、降低成本、节约原材料，都是与生产小组的活动密切相关的。树立小组“标兵”，就便于发扬广大群众的集体主义精神，便于发扬互助协作的共产主义风格。
    在“标兵”树立以后，领导者的责任在于如何使这个别的或少量的先进因素迅速发生普遍的作用，并在这种发展过程中，发现更积极的因素、更向上提高，向前发展。
