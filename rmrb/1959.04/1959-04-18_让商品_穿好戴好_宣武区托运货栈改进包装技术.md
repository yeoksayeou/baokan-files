　　Reported by this newspaper: The Xuanwu District Freight Depot in Beijing is doing everything possible to find packaging materials and save on packaging materials, promoting the exchange of goods.

　　The Xuanwu District Freight Depot is an organization that collects goods on behalf of customers and handles packaging and shipping, so it uses a lot of packaging materials. In order to save on packaging materials, this depot has improved its packaging technology based on the principle of not affecting the safety of the goods and according to the nature and shape of the goods, adopting various different packaging methods. Those that must be packaged in wooden boxes are disassembled and packaged separately as parts as much as possible; some that do not need to be packaged in wooden boxes are packaged with wooden flower racks or wooden splints instead. For example, incubators and distillers in medical equipment have protective frames themselves. In the past, all packaging used wooden boxes, but now they are replaced with wooden flower racks. The head of the sewing machine is relatively precise, while the frame part is not easily damaged. In the past, all were packaged in wooden boxes, but now the head is packaged in a wooden box, and the frame below is packaged with straw mats. For large machine tools that cannot be disassembled, small wooden boxes are fastened on precise parts, and the rest is packaged with straw ropes. In the past, various lamps, scientific instruments, building materials, etc. entrusted were all packed into wooden boxes and transported as less-than-truckload cargo. Now, they are converted into containers.

　　Combining freight business with actively establishing recycling relationships for packaging materials with enterprises is another way for this freight depot to save packaging materials. They have established packaging material recycling relationships with more than 20 enterprises and institutions that have great potential for packaging materials, such as warehouses, various commodity wholesale stations, and non-staple food stores, so as to recover packaging materials as soon as they are available. In addition, this freight depot has mobilized the broad masses of workers to find packaging materials from all directions. When staff member Zhang Junqiu and worker Zhao Zongzhen went to the Guang'anmen Dadong Station to submit commodity manifests, they found a pile of wood shavings in the freight yard of the East Station, and immediately contacted the East Station and recovered more than 1,000 kilograms of waste wood shavings and rice straw. When worker Yin Guoyin participated in voluntary labor on the street, he chatted with a cadre from the Import and Export Preview Hall and found that they often had a large number of goods coming in and out, and immediately established a packaging material recycling relationship with them.

　　Through these methods, from January to now this year, this freight depot has recovered more than 20,000 kilograms of rice straw and wood shavings, more than 1,000 kilograms of wrapping paper, and more than 3,000 various wooden boxes and strip baskets, saving the state a lot of packaging material costs.

　　The Xuanwu District Freight Depot's efforts to find packaging materials not only saved the country's wealth, but more importantly expanded its business, promoted the exchange of materials, and vigorously supported industrial and agricultural production. The Wuhan Scientific Research Supplies Supply Office bought more than 4,000 pieces of milling machines, instruments, chemicals, infrastructure materials, etc. in Beijing, but could not ship them for a while because there were no packaging materials. The staff of this freight depot used old materials to package them and helped to quickly transport the goods. (Zhang Zhiqing)

### 让商品“穿好戴好”  宣武区托运货栈改进包装技术

　　让商品“穿好戴好”宣武区托运货栈改进包装技术
    本报讯　北京市宣武区托运货栈千方百计寻找包装材料，并节约商品包装材料，促进了物资交流。
    宣武区托运货栈是一个代顾客提取商品、办理包装托运的机构，因此使用包装材料较多。这个货栈为了节约包装材料，曾根据不影响商品安全的原则和按照商品的性质、形状，改进商品包装技术，采取各种不同的包装办法。必需用木箱包装的，尽量拆卸按部件分别包装；有些可以不用木箱包装的改用木花架或木夹板包装。如医疗器械中的保温箱和蒸馏器，本身有防护架，过去包装全用木箱，现在则改用木花架。缝纫机的机头比较精密，而机架部分不易损坏，过去全部用木箱包装，现在改为机头用木箱包装，下面机架子用草片包装。对于不能拆卸的大型机床，用小型木箱扣在精密机件上，其余部分用草绳包装。过去受托的各种灯具，科学仪器，建筑材料等，都是装入木箱，当零担货物运送，现在改装集装箱。
    结合托运业务，主动同企业单位建立包装材料回收关系，是这个货栈节约包装材料的另一个办法。他们已同包装材料潜力很大的仓库、各种商品批发站和副食品门市部等二十多个企业单位建立了包装材料回收的关系，作到了包装材料随有随回收。此外，这个货栈还发动广大职工从四面八方寻找包装材料。职员章俊秋、工人赵宗振到广安门大东站交商品货单时，发现东站的货场上有一堆木丝，即主动与东站联系，回收了废旧木丝和稻草一千多斤。工人殷国音到街道上参加义务劳动时，同进出口预展馆一位干部闲聊天，发现他们经常有大批商品进出，立即与他们建立了包装材料回收的关系。
    通过这些办法，从今年1月到现在，这个货栈已回收稻草和木丝两万多斤，包装纸一千多斤，各种木箱和条筐三千多个，给国家节省了很多包装材料费用。
    宣武区托运货栈千方百计寻找包装材料，不仅为国家节约了财富，更重要的是扩大了业务，促进了物资交流，有力地支援了工农业生产。武汉科学研究用品供应处，在北京买到铣床、仪器、化学药品、基建材料等四千多件，因为一时没有包装材料不能起运，这个货栈的职工即利用旧料包装，帮助把商品迅速运走了。　（张志清）
