Mr. Chairman, Fellow Delegates:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the final state accounts for 1958 and the draft state budget for 1959, and Secretary-General Peng Zhen's work report on the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I suggest that the Congress adopt them.

From 1953 to 1957, our country successfully overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan for the national economy, thereby establishing a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. In 1958, we continued to develop economic construction under the Second Five-Year Plan, and on the existing solid foundation, there emerged an unprecedented and vigorous overall leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. These great achievements are inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party, the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm of the people across the country, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. Under these favorable conditions, the Chinese people, full of confidence, will, under the absolute leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, exert even greater efforts to achieve an even greater and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959.

In 1958, along with the overall Great Leap Forward, people's communes combining industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs were established throughout the country. This further promoted the transition from socialist to communist society, enabling the realization of the ideal and happy communist society in our country at an early date. This is the ardent desire of our 650 million people, which cannot be undermined or obstructed by any slander from imperialists.

Last year, our country launched a nationwide steelmaking campaign. In every corner of the country, regardless of age, people happily and cheerfully participated in the work of smelting steel, changing the past cold and desolate situation of the steel industry being run by a small number of people, and breaking the myth that the steel industry was unattainable. This led to the rapid development of all industries and agriculture. Our bourgeois intellectuals participated in physical labor in this great movement. Therefore, while developing the steel industry, we also tempered people and created conditions for the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, making it possible to draw a portion of the agricultural labor force to engage in industrial labor, thus promoting industrial production.

In terms of the steel industry, our country overfulfilled the production target of 10.7 million tons of steel last year, with a 107% increase in output compared to 1957, an increase of 5.75 million tons. This rate of increase is unprecedented in the world and created an unparalleled miracle. Such a great achievement could only be realized under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, mobilizing the wisdom and inventions of all working people, breaking dogma and superstition, and promoting the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Last year's Great Leap Forward was the most profound lesson in communism for our technical personnel.

In his Government Work Report, Premier Zhou put forward the tasks on the economic front in 1959, calling on the people across the country to strive to complete the four major targets of 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 1,050 billion jin of grain, and 100 million dan of cotton. We, who are engaged in the steel industry, are excited and pledge to make our greatest efforts to complete and overfulfill the glorious task of producing 18 million tons of steel. At the same time, it must be pointed out that this year's steel production task must be completed while ensuring quality. Therefore, the actual figures should also be double that of last year's production, and the absolute increase will exceed that of last year by a large margin. Therefore, we must adopt a combination of hard work and smart work to take certain measures to complete this great and glorious task. Now I would like to express my personal opinions on certain issues concerning the development of our country's steel industry for your consideration and correction.

(1) Research and solve technical problems of small steelmaking converters. This year, a large part of the 18 million tons of steel to be completed in our country is converter steel, but there are still many urgent problems to be solved in terms of equipment and technical operation, such as how to improve the life of furnace lining, rationalize the design and manufacturing of converters to improve equipment utilization, and how to improve the quality of steel. We should organize forces and adopt the mass line, launching a "big blooming and contending" (大鸣大放) campaign to ensure that the problems are solved smoothly, otherwise it may affect the guarantee of the quality of 18 million tons of steel.

(2) Research and solve the design and manufacturing problems of large bottom-blown Thomas steelmaking furnaces. Our country is rich in iron ore resources, and the categories are extremely complex. A large part of it is high-phosphorus iron ore, especially in the area south of the Yangtze River, which is even more prominent. It is most suitable to use the simple and cheap Thomas steelmaking method for smelting, but the design and related technology for large-scale use of the Thomas furnace steelmaking method have not been completely mastered in the country. I think this technology is not the most complex cutting-edge science, and we have the conditions to conduct experimental research. We can also use the spirit of invention and creation to solve various equipment problems. Some comrades are still afraid that they will not be able to produce high-quality steel, so they dare not promote its use. This does not seem to conform to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. Therefore, in order to make this steelmaking method more guaranteed, please ask relevant research institutions to focus on research and design.

(3) The design of steel plants and the equipment used should pay attention to quality. Last year, in the Great Leap Forward movement of the national steel industry, various design departments worked hard and cleverly, breaking conventions and dogmas. They used simplified designs, changed design procedures, and combined with the masses to do design, etc., and completed a large number of standard designs and general designs in a very short period of time. This played a decisive role in the rapid launch of small and medium-sized steel plants. However, due to the excessive haste of time, the actual experience of the designers was still insufficient, so there were many situations that deviated from reality, resulting in many irrationalities in production. Although the design aspects have been modified and supplemented in a timely manner, they still cannot fully meet the actual needs. Therefore, in future designs, special attention should be paid to quality so that it fully complies with the country's construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. In terms of the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, appropriate attention should also be paid to the required degree of mechanization to adapt to the newly emerging labor shortage in our country, and attention should also be paid to preserving the possibility of future development and improvement.

(4) The timely supply of metallurgical equipment. At present, the problem of steel material yield has not been solved well enough, and the supply of steel is far from meeting the needs of large-scale construction. Therefore, the mass and rapid manufacturing of steel rolling equipment is the current arduous task of the machinery manufacturing industry, and relevant departments should pay special attention to this issue. Solve the problems of raw materials, tools, and technology for them, and it is necessary to launch a vigorous technical revolution movement, come up with various clever methods, and combine them with actual operations to supply metallurgical equipment that meets quality requirements in a timely manner, and complete the important task of equipment matching, which will play a major role in completing the task of 18 million tons of steel this year.

(5) The issue of engineering queueing and the overall national coordination. Last year, the enthusiastic participation of the people across the country in running the steel industry was an important factor in the Great Leap Forward, but because the scope of the development was too broad and the strength was somewhat dispersed, it had a certain impact on the early commissioning of various units. Therefore, the focus on key projects proposed by Premier Zhou in his report is particularly important in my opinion. Only in this way can we concentrate financial and material resources and focus on key projects with better conditions. At the same time, we must also pay attention to the proper combination of large, medium, and small projects, which is of great significance to the overfulfillment of steel production. For other projects, we should make detailed preparations in advance, have enough time to consider various aspects of the problem, do high-quality design, and be able to start immediately when the conditions are available, and we cannot afford to be complacent.

The construction and production tasks given to us by the state in 1959 are glorious and arduous. We, who are engaged in the steel industry, guarantee to obey the leadership of the Party, muster greater revolutionary enthusiasm, and strive to complete the state's four major production targets in 1959.

    关于钢铁工业的几点建议
    夏以焜代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告、李富春副总理所作的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理所作的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告和彭真秘书长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告，建议大会予以通过。
    从一九五三年到一九五七年，我国胜利地超额完成了国民经济的第一个五年计划，使我国从此建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础，在一九五八年继续展开了第二个五年计划的经济建设，在已有的巩固基础上又出现了一个轰轰烈烈空前的工农业生产全面大跃进，这种伟大的成就是和党的正确领导、全国人民的冲天革命干劲和苏联的无私援助分不开的，在这种有利的条件下，我国人民将满怀信心，在党和毛主席的绝对领导下，鼓足更大的干劲，在一九五九年完成更大更全面的跃进。
    在一九五八年全面大跃进的同时，在全国范围内成立了工农商学兵相结合的人民公社，这就更促进了从社会主义到共产主义社会的过渡，使理想和幸福的共产主义社会提早在我国实现。这是我们全国六亿五千万人民的急切愿望，不是帝国主义者的任何诬蔑所能破坏和阻挡的。
    去年，我国开展了一个全民炼钢铁的运动，在全国每个角落里，不论老少，都愉快舒畅地参加了冶炼钢铁的工作，改变了过去冷冷清清由少数人办钢铁工业的局面，破除了钢铁工业高不可攀的迷信，因而带动了所有工农业的迅速发展，我们资产阶级的知识分子在这个伟大的运动中参加了体力劳动，所以在发展了钢铁工业的同时，又锻炼了人，也替农业的机械化和电气化创造了条件，使有可能抽出一部分农业劳动力从事工业劳动，促进工业生产。
    在钢铁工业方面，去年我国超额完成了一千零七十万吨钢的生产任务，产量比一九五七年增加了百分之一百零七，计增产五百七十五万吨，这种增产速度是全世界从来所没有过的，创造了史无前例的奇迹，这种伟大事迹，只有在共产党的英明领导下，发动了全体劳动人民的智慧和发明创造，破除了教条和迷信，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，才能实现的。去年的大跃进，对我们技术人员来讲，是一课最深刻的共产主义教育。
    周总理在政府工作报告中提出了一九五九年经济战线上的任务，号召全国人民为完成钢产量一千八百万吨、煤产量三亿八千万吨、粮食产量一万零五百亿斤、棉花产量一亿担的四项主要指标而奋斗，我们从事钢铁工业工作者，怀着兴奋的心情，在完成和超额完成一千八百万吨钢产量的光荣任务中保证作出最大的努力。同时必须指出，今年的钢铁生产任务，必须在保证质量的情况下完成，因此在实际数字上也达到去年生产量的一倍，绝对增产数字也超过去年很多，所以一定要采取苦干与巧干相结合的办法作出一定的措施，来完成这个伟大的光荣任务。现在我想就发展我国钢铁工业方面的某些问题，发表我个人的意见，请各位代表指正。
    （一）研究和解决小型炼钢转炉技术问题。今年我国所要完成一千八百万吨钢产量中间，有很大一部分是转炉钢，但现在在设备和技术操作方面，还有不少急待解决的问题，例如怎样提高炉衬寿命、转炉设计和制造合理化来使设备作业率提高和怎样提高钢的质量等，应组织力量并采用群众路线，大鸣大放，使问题得到顺利解决，否则可能会影响一千八百万吨钢质量的保证。
    （二）研究和解决大型底吹托马斯炼钢炉的设计和制造问题。我国铁矿资源丰富，品类亦极复杂，内中有很大一部分是高磷的铁矿，尤其是在长江以南地带，更为特出，最宜采用简单便宜的托马斯炼钢方法来冶炼，但大规模用托马斯炉炼钢法的设计和有关技术，目前在国内尚未完全掌握。我想这种技术并非是最复杂的尖端科学，我们是有条件进行试验研究的，我们也可以用发明创造的精神，解决各项设备问题，有些同志还怕不能炼制优质钢材，因此不敢推广采用，这似乎不太合乎多快好省的原则，因此为了使该项炼钢方法更有保证，请有关研究机构加以重点研究和设计。
    （三）钢铁厂和所用设备的设计，应注意质量。去年在全国钢铁工业大跃进的运动中，各设计部门曾进行苦干和巧干，打破了常规和教条，用简化设计、改变设计程序以及结合群众做设计等方法，在极短的时间内，完成了大量的标准设计和通用设计，这对中小型钢铁厂的迅速上马，起了决定性的作用，但由于时间过分匆促，设计工作者的实际经验还不够，所以有很多脱离实际的情况，以致造成许多生产上的不合理，虽经设计方面及时地修改和补充，但仍不能完全满足实际上的需要，所以在今后的设计中，应特别注意质量，使全面地符合国家多快好省的建设方针。在土洋结合方面，也应适当地注意应有的机械化程度，以适应我国新近出现劳动力紧张的情况，并应注意保留将来发展和改进的可能性。
    （四）冶金设备的及时供应问题。现在关于钢料成材问题，还解决得不够好，钢材的供应，还远远不能满足大规模建设的需要，因此轧钢设备的大量快速制造，是当前机械制造业的艰巨任务，应请有关部门特别重视这一问题。替他们解决原材料、工具以及技术等问题，并有必要展开一个轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动，想出各种巧干的办法，和实际操作相结合，及时地供应合乎质量要求的冶金设备，完成设备配套的重要任务，这对完成今年一千八百万吨钢的任务，将起重大作用。
    （五）工程排队和全国一盘棋问题。去年全国劳动人民，热火朝天地办钢铁工业，是大跃进的重要因素，但是因为开展的面太广了一些，力量有些分散，对各单位的提早投入生产，有一定的影响，所以周总理在报告中所提出的要抓住重点，我认为特别重要，这样才能集中财力物力，突击条件较好的重点工程，同时还要注意大中小妥善地互相结合，这对钢铁生产的超额完成，有重大意义。对其他工程则宜提早作详尽的准备工作，有足够时间来考虑各方面的问题，做好质量较高的设计，等到有了条件，就可立刻上马，不能稍存松懈的心理。
    一九五九年国家给予我们的建设和生产任务是光荣而繁重的，我们从事钢铁工业的工作者，保证服从党的领导，鼓足更大的革命干劲为完成国家在一九五九年的生产四大指标而努力奋斗。
