　　Advancing Along the Broad Road of Communist Construction
    New Developments Constantly Emerging in Soviet Rural Areas
　　Smaller collective farms are being merged; joint construction efforts are increasing in scale; collective farms are fully supplying vegetables and milk, and farmers are voluntarily giving up their private plots and dairy cows...
    Our Moscow dispatch, April 10th. With the progress of communist construction, Soviet collective farms are advancing along the road of communist construction. Due to the tremendous achievements in Soviet agricultural development in recent years, many new things have emerged in the life of collective farms in the Soviet Union. The direction of development of these things will gradually bring the current collective ownership closer to ownership by the whole people, and thus gradually eliminate the differences between urban and rural areas.
    In recent years, the cultivated area of collective farms has expanded, and many smaller farms have been merged. If there were 94,000 collective farms in the Soviet Union in 1953, the number of collective farms is now only about 70,000.
    One of the new things in the life of collective farms is the increasing scale of joint construction by collective farms. According to statistics, there are currently as many as 748 power stations jointly built by collective farms in the Soviet Union. In Ukraine alone, there are 600 organizations engaged in the construction of collective farms, and the collective farms participating in these construction organizations account for more than 70% of the entire republic. There are also more than 400 such collective farm construction organizations in the Russian Republic. For example, recently, the collective farms in Rostov Oblast have built seven power stations, one hundred schools, fifteen transformer stations, fifteen brick and tile factories, and thirty hospitals by themselves. Because the farms are building on their own, the face of the countryside is also changing rapidly. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that by 1965, all collective farms will be electrified. In the near future, all Soviet farms will be transformed into residential areas with modern equipment, similar to small cities.
    The large-scale development of joint construction by collective farms is a manifestation of the continuous increase in farm income in recent years, and is a concrete reflection of the increase in public accumulation funds. In 1952, the cash income of all collective farms in the Soviet Union was 42.8 billion rubles; in 1958, this income reached 130 billion rubles.
    With the large-scale construction of the Seven-Year Plan, the joint construction of collective farms will be further expanded. For example, collective farms in the Tajik Republic will use 2.4 billion rubles for the construction of power stations and water conservancy projects in seven years. The Kalmyk Autonomous Republic has already formulated a two-year plan to vigorously build cultural buildings and green all villages in the next two years.
    Another new thing in the life of Soviet collective farms is that farmers in some agriculturally advanced areas voluntarily gave up their private plots and private dairy cows, because the development of farm production can fully supply them with vegetables and milk, and farmers no longer need to spend a lot of energy producing these items. For example, the "Red October" collective farm in Kirov Oblast, Russian Republic, abolished private plots, and farmers of the Kalinovka collective farm in Kursk Oblast sold all their dairy cows to the farm, and the vegetables and milk they needed were completely supplied by the farm.
    The transition from workdays to cash wages is also a new thing in the life of collective farms. Some advanced collective farms, due to the development of production, are already able to pay farmers a portion of cash every month. This method of labor calculation is exactly the same as that of state-owned farms. From these new things, people can see that the Soviet countryside is advancing towards communism.

　　沿着共产主义建设大道前进
    苏联农村新事物不断涌现
　　较小集体农庄实行合并；合力建设规模日益扩大；农庄充分供应蔬菜和牛奶，庄员自愿放弃宅旁园地和奶牛；……
    本报莫斯科10日电　随着共产主义建设的进展，苏联的集体农庄正在沿着共产主义的建设道路向前迈进。由于近年来苏联农业发展的巨大成绩，目前在苏联的集体农庄生活中出现了许多新鲜的事物，这些事物的发展方向，在将来会使目前的集体所有制一步步接近于全民所有制，因而也会导致城乡区别逐渐消灭。
    近年来集体农庄的耕作面积都有所扩大，许多较小的农庄实行了合并，如果说在1953年苏联共有九万四千个集体农庄，那么在目前集体农庄的数目只有七万左右。
    在集体农庄生活中新鲜的事物之一，是集体农庄合力建设的规模日益扩大。据统计，目前在苏联集体农庄合力兴建的电站已经有七百四十八座之多，仅在乌克兰就有六百个从事集体农庄建设的组织，参加这些建设组织的集体农庄，占全共和国的70％以上。在俄罗斯共和国这样的集体农庄建设组织也有四百多个，例如，最近罗斯托夫州的集体农庄自己就建成了七座电站、一百所学校、十五座变电站、十五座砖瓦厂和三十所医院。由于农庄自己动手建设，所以农村的面目也在迅速改变。七年计划规定到1965年时，所有的集体农庄都将电气化，在不远的将来，苏联所有的农庄全将变成有近代化设备的、类似小城市的居民区。
    集体农庄合力建设的大规模展开，是近年来农庄收入不断增多的表现，并且是公积金增加的具体反映。在1952年，苏联所有集体农庄的现金收入是四百二十八亿卢布；而在1958年，这项收入已达到一千三百亿卢布。
    随着七年计划的大规模建设的展开，集体农庄的合力建设还将进一步扩大，例如塔吉克共和国的集体农庄，在七年内就将用二十四亿卢布从事电站和水利工程的建设，而喀尔丁自治共和国已经制定了两年计划，在今后两年内要大力兴建文化建筑，并绿化所有乡村。
    苏联集体农庄生活中的另一件新事物是，一些农业先进区的庄员自愿放弃了宅旁园地和私人乳牛，因为农庄生产的发展已经可以充分供应他们以蔬菜和牛奶，庄员已经没有必要用很大精力生产这些物品。例如俄罗斯共和国基洛夫州的“红十月”集体农庄就取消了宅旁园地，库尔斯克州的卡里诺夫卡集体农庄庄员，全把自己的乳牛卖给了农庄，他们需要的蔬菜、牛奶完全由农庄供给。
    由劳动日过渡到现金工资制，也是集体农庄生活中的一件新事。有些先进的集体农庄，由于生产的发展，已经有条件每月发给庄员一部分现金，这样的劳动的计算法已经和国营农场完全一样。从这些新事物中，人们可以看到苏联的农村正在向共产主义前进。
