    The well shaft is the throat of a coal mine. Building a mine requires digging a well first. Due to the limited working face, underground water dripping from overhead, poor underground lighting, and other conditions, the amount of work involved in excavating a well shaft is very arduous. Before liberation, it would take three to five years to dig a pair of well shafts about 200 meters deep, and a monthly progress of over ten meters was considered good. After liberation, due to the adoption of mechanized construction, the monthly well completion reached over sixty meters. Especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, due to hard work and ingenuity, the progress of well shaft completion has increased exponentially. The construction period for a pair of well shafts generally accounts for 30% of the entire mine construction period.

    井筒
    井筒是煤矿矿井的咽喉，建设一个矿井首先就需要打井。由于工作面有限，地下水又从头顶上淋下，地下光线不良等条件，开凿井筒的工程量很艰巨。在解放以前，打一对二百公尺左右的井筒，就要三五年的时间，月进成井上十公尺就算好了。解放以后，由于采用机械化施工，凿井月成井就达到六十公尺以上，特别是去年大跃进以来，由于苦干加巧干，井筒成井进度成倍地增长。一对井筒的开凿期限，一般占整个建井期限的30％。
