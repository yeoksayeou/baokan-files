Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with the work report of Vice Chairman Li Weihan of the CPPCC, Premier Zhou’s government work report, Deputy Premier Li Fuchun’s report, and Deputy Premier Li Xiannian’s financial report. I wholeheartedly praise the brilliant achievements of our socialist economic construction under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the great measures of the People's Government, and the vigorous efforts of the national working people. I guarantee to contribute all my strength to my work in the future and strive for the continued great leap forward in 1959.

The former Tibetan local government and a handful of reactionaries launched an armed rebellion, cutting themselves off from the big family of the motherland and suffering the consequences. Imperialists and Indian expansionists colluded with them,妄想to undermine our country's unity and restore the imperialist aggressive forces in Tibet; attempting to preserve the backward, reactionary, and cruel serf system in Tibet, which has suffered a shameful defeat. I express my boundless anger at their criminal actions! The State Council's wise measures for Tibet and the heroic and timely actions of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet have foiled the imperialists' conspiracy and have been warmly endorsed and supported by the people of the whole country.

I am an educator, and I would like to report to the conference on the leap forward situation in my school, the Chengdu Institute of Technology, over the past year.

On the basis of the great victory of rectification and anti-rightist struggle, under the guidance of the idea of continuous revolution, the Party Committee of the school fully mobilized all teachers and students in the college and successively launched mass movements of "two antis," the great debate of "red and expert," the great debate of teaching, work-study programs, running factories in a big way, conducting scientific research on a large scale, and smelting steel in a big way. Through these movements, the vast majority of teachers and students in the college gained a deep understanding of the Party's educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor in terms of policy and ideology, and most of them expressed active support for this policy. They not only enthusiastically posted thousands of big-character posters to praise this great revolution in education, but also enthusiastically and energetically devoted themselves to various educational reforms, bringing a new look and atmosphere to teaching. I will briefly report on two examples of the achievements over the past year.

I. Launching Work-Study Programs Inside and Outside the School Under the Guiding Principle of Combining Teaching, Scientific Research, and Production

Under the leadership of the Party Committee of the school, various departments have launched various forms of work-study programs inside and outside the school in combination with professional requirements and teaching arrangements over the past year. All the past impractical and unrealistic designs have been changed to designs combined with the current tasks of production and construction. Among them, the teachers and students of the Civil Engineering Department surveyed, designed, and renovated 763 kilometers of highways, 139 bridges, 1,490 culverts, and 96 oil well sites for the central Sichuan oil area; the teachers and students of the Water Conservancy Department designed 14 hydropower stations with an installed capacity of more than 110,000 kilowatts, irrigating an area of more than 310,000 mu in their task design; the teachers and students of the Chemical Engineering Department completed the task design of 21 chemical plants with a total investment of more than 40 million yuan in their task design; the teachers and students of the Electrical Engineering Department completed the electrical part design of six power stations for production units in their task design and completed 71 transmission and distribution line designs in cooperation with other departments; the teachers and students of the Mechanical Engineering Department completed the design of a tractor factory with an annual output of 2,000 units, a farm tool factory with an annual output of 20,000 sets, and a transportation equipment factory in their task design, and carried out product design and technical innovation for the mechanical manufacturing factory of our college. In addition, the students of the Civil Engineering and Water Conservancy departments, in combination with surveying practice, completed topographic surveys of 20 square kilometers for the Chengdu Municipal Construction Committee, participated in the survey of the impact of human economic activities on runoff in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and trained more than 1,000 rural hydropower technicians for Wanxian and Fuling Prefectures by combining on-site surveys, designs, construction, holding on-site meetings, and on-site teaching. At the same time, within the school, 1,200 students from various departments of the college were involved in running factories in a big way and conducting scientific research on a large scale, and they trial-produced 386 kinds of products, including 261 kinds produced by the Chemical Engineering Department, some of which reached or exceeded international standards. The movement greatly improved the professional level and educational quality of teachers and students, and laid a mass foundation for further implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor.

II. Mobilizing the Masses to Launch a Mass Movement of Scientific Research

Under the impetus and encouragement of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country, under the leadership of the Party Committee of the college, the masses emancipated their minds, broke down superstitions, put politics in command, and a vigorous new situation of a great leap forward in scientific research and technological innovation emerged throughout the college, and a number of achievements were made. In the past, scientific research work was only being carried out by a small number of people, the scene was cold and deserted, and only a very limited amount was completed. Now, both veteran and young teachers are actively involved in this field of practice, and thousands of lively students are joining hands to march towards difficult and meticulous scientific research. Only 122 scientific research projects were planned for this year, but due to the great leap forward in work, 447 projects have actually been completed, accounting for 367% of the original plan. Among them, the Chemical Engineering Department completed 261 projects, the Water Conservancy Department 61 projects, the Mechanical Engineering Department 54 projects, the Civil Engineering Department 37 projects, the Electrical Engineering Department 16 projects, the Mathematics Teaching and Research Group 14 projects, and the Physics Teaching and Research Group 4 projects. In terms of the nature of the scientific and technological achievements, 386 projects belonged to the trial production of new products, 23 projects belonged to production technology research reports and innovation schemes, and 38 projects belonged to scientific research papers.

Among the completed projects, there are more than 30 cutting-edge scientific research projects such as analog electronic computers, electric spark machining machine tools, ultrasonic machining machine tools, extraction of rare metals (thorium, germanium, gallium, lithium, rubidium, molybdenum, uranium, tungsten, beryllium, etc.) and new chemical industrial products such as fiberglass and solid petroleum, etc. More than 20 projects reached or exceeded international standards, such as furfural alcohol plastics, quick paint removers, insulating varnishes, synthetic tannins, reagent-grade leather powder, refined pyrogallic acid, low-grade cement making high-grade concrete, vacuum fractionators, and vocal cord electrotherapy needles, etc.; More than 120 items have reached domestic advanced level or belong to domestic originals, such as synthetic fiber, all-purpose adhesive, chloroprene rubber, vegetable tannin tannin extract, special heat-resistant leather, fast leather making process, mirabilite making nitrogen fertilizer, silkworm pupa glue making laminated plywood adhesive, cement making machine tool seat, four-purpose machine tool seat, reinforced concrete machine tool base, eddy current dynamometer, DC calculator, and field measuring instrument for soil filling project quality. Most of these research results are oriented to industrial and agricultural production, and some of these products have been put into production, and some technical designs and innovation schemes have been adopted by production departments.

It can be seen from the above situation that the new atmosphere and the facts of some achievements made by the scientific and technological work of our college since the Great Leap Forward have powerfully proved that: (1) Scientific and technological work must closely rely on the leadership of the Party, put politics in command in everything, and the absolute leadership of the Party over scientific and technological work is the fundamental guarantee for the rapid development of scientific and technological undertakings; (2) Scientific and technological work must rely on the masses and carry out mass movements in a big way in order to develop it in a faster, better and more economical way; (3) In scientific and technological work, we must break down superstitions and liberate our minds in order to be full of energy, high in morale, and leap forward in work; (4) Scientific and technological work must be closely combined with production and conscientiously serve production in order to have a source, motivation, and broad development prospects. In fact, there are struggles between two roads and two methods on these issues in our college. Therefore, resolutely implementing the Party's leadership over scientific and technological work and criticizing and eliminating the traditional concepts and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie in scientific work will be the firm and unshakable fundamental principle of our college's scientific and technological work in the future.

Finally, let us always remember what Premier Zhou said in his report. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction, let us unite closely and greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, the People's Republic of China, with active actions to complete and overfulfill the 1959 plan! That's all. I wish the conference a success and everyone good health!

    成都工学院焕然一新
    张铨委员谈一年来的教学和科学研究的成就主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意政协李维汉副主席的工作报告，周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理的报告和李先念副总理的财经报告，我以无比的欢欣赞扬我国社会主义经济建设，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，人民政府的伟大措施和全国劳动人民的干劲冲天的努力下取得了辉煌的成绩。我保证今后在工作岗位中，贡献自己所有的力量。为一九五九年的继续大跃进而努力。
    原西藏地方政府和一小撮反动分子发动武装叛乱，自绝于祖国人民的大家庭，自食其果。帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子从中勾结，妄想破坏我国的统一，恢复帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力；妄想保存西藏落后的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度，已遭到了可耻的失败。我对他们这些罪恶行动，表示无比的愤怒！国务院对西藏的英明措施和人民解放军驻藏部队英勇的及时的行动，使帝国主义的阴谋不得逞，得到全国人民的热烈拥护和支持。
    我是教育工作者，仅就我所在的学校，成都工学院，在过去一年来的跃进情况向大会汇报。
    成都工学院在整风、反右取得了伟大的胜利的基础上，校党委在不断革命的思想指导下，充分发动了全院师生，陆续展开了双反、红专大辩论、教学大辩论、勤工俭学、大办工厂、大搞科研和大炼钢铁的群众性运动。通过这些运动，使全院的广大师生员工，对党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育和劳动生产相结合的方针，从政策思想上有了深刻的认识，绝大多数师生对这一方针表示积极的拥护。他们不仅热情洋溢地贴出了成千上万张的大字报来歌颂这个教育工作的伟大革命，而且精神振奋，干劲十足地投身到各项教育改革工作中去，使教学工作面貌和气象焕然一新。现就一年来的成就中单举出两项事例，简略地汇报。
    一、在教学、科学研究、生产三结合的方针下展开校内外勤工俭学活动
    一年来在院党委领导下，各专业都结合专业要求和教学安排，开展了多种形式的校内外勤工俭学活动。把过去脱离实际的空想设计，全部改为结合当前生产建设的任务设计，其中土木系师生在任务设计中为川中油区测设和改建公路七百六十三公里，桥梁一百三十九座，涵洞一千四百九十个，油井井场九十六个；水利系师生在任务设计中设计水电站十四个，装机容量达十一万多瓩，灌溉农田面积达三十一万余亩；化工系师生，在任务设计中完成了各类化工厂共二十一个的任务设计，建厂总投资额约四千万元以上；电机系师生在任务设计中为生产单位完成六个电站的电气部分设计，并与其它部门协作完成了输配电的线路设计七十一项；机械系师生在任务设计中完成了设计年产二千台的拖拉机制造厂一个，年产二万套农具的农具制造厂一个和交通工具厂一个，并进行了我院机械制造厂的产品设计和技术革新等工作。此外，土木、水利两系同学结合测量实习为成都市建委完成了二十平方公里的地形测量，参加了长江上游人类经济活动对径流影响的勘测工作，并为万县、涪陵两个专区以具体进行水电站的勘测、设计，修筑、召开现场会议与进行现场教学相结合的方式，培训了农村水电技术人员一千余人。同时，在校内，全院各系同学有一千二百人投入大办工厂，大搞科学研究，共试制各种产品达三百八十六项，其中化工系制成二百六十一项，有的质量达到并超过国际水平。在运动中大大地提高了教师和同学的业务水平和教育质量，而为进一步贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针打下了群众性的基础。
    二、发动群众大搞科学研究运动
    我院科学技术研究工作，在全国工农业生产大跃进形势的推动与鼓舞下，在院党委的领导下，群众解放了思想，破除了迷信，政治挂帅，全院出现了一个大搞科学研究和技术革新的轰轰烈烈的大跃进的新局面，取得了不少成果。以往科学研究工作只凭少数人在工作着，场面冷冷清清，完成的极有限。现在是老年教师和青年教师都踊跃地投入这个实践的领域中，加上了数以千计的生龙活虎般的同学，共同携手向艰巨的、细致的科学研究进军。这一年的科学研究计划只订出了一百二十二项，由于工作大跃进，实际已完成了四百四十七项，为原计划的百分之三百六十七。其中，化工系完成了二百六十一项，水利系六十一项，机械系五十四项，土木系三十七项，电机系十六项，数学教研组十四项，物理教研组四项。按科学技术工作成果的性质来看，属于新产品试制的共三百八十六项，属于生产技术研究报告及革新方案的二十三项，属于科学研究论文的三十八项。
    在完成的项目中，属于尖端科学研究的有模拟电子计算机，电火花加工机床，超声波加工机床，稀有金属（钍、锗、镓、锂、铷、钼、铀、钨、铍等）的提取以及化学工业新产品如玻璃钢，固体石油等共三十余项，质量达到或超过国际水平的有糠醇塑料、快速退漆剂、绝缘漆、合成丹宁、试剂用皮粉、精制焦棓酸、低标号水泥制高标号混凝土、真空分馏器、声带电疗针等共二十余项；达到国内高级或属于国内首创的有合成纤维、万能胶、氯丁橡胶、植物丹宁栲胶、特种耐热皮革、快速制革工艺、芒硝制氮肥、蚕蛹胶制层板胶合剂、水泥制机床座、四用机床座、钢筋混凝土机床台座、涡流测功器、直流计算器、填土工程质量野外测定仪共一百二十余项。这些研究成果绝大部分都是面向工农业生产的，其中有些产品已投入生产，有的技术设计及革新方案已为生产部门采用。
    从上述情况可以看出，我院科学技术工作在大跃进以来的新气象以及取得的若干成果的事实，有力地证明了：（1）科学技术工作必须紧密依靠党的领导，事事政治挂帅，党对科学技术工作的绝对领导是迅速发展科学技术事业的根本保证；（2）科学技术工作必须依靠群众，大搞群众运动，才能多快好省地发展起来；（3）在科学技术工作上必须破除迷信，解放思想，才能意气焕发，斗志昂扬，工作跃进；（4）科学技术工作必须紧密结合生产，认真服务生产，才有源头，才有动力，才有广阔的发展前途。在这几个问题上，我院事实上都存在着两条道路和两种方法的斗争，因此，坚决贯彻党对科学技术工作的领导，批判和清除科学工作中资产阶级的传统概念和思想影响，将是我院今后科学技术工作的坚定不移的根本原则。
    末了，让我们时刻记住周总理的报告中说，让我们在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的指导下，紧密地团结起来，用完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的积极行动，来迎接我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国建立的十周年！完了，祝大会胜利，各位健康！
