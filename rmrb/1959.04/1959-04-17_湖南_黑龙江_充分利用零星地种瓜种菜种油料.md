　　Fully Utilize Scattered Land to Plant Melons, Vegetables, and Oil Crops
Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th. While vigorously engaging in spring plowing and rice transplanting, Hunan is mobilizing the broad masses of commune members to seize the season and rush to plant early-maturing crops such as melons and vegetables, striving to leave no land idle. As of April 6th, the province has sown over 2.2 million mu of early-maturing crops such as spring buckwheat, potatoes, and corn; and planted approximately 1 million mu of melons and vegetables. According to statistics from Chen County alone, 21.82 million pumpkin seedlings were planted in the gaps in front of and behind houses, and beans were sown along more than 19 million field ridges and irrigation canals. Many people's communes in the Xiangxi area launched a "Hundred Pumpkins per Household" pumpkin mountain campaign. According to statistics from seven counties including Fenghuang and Jishou, over 15 million pumpkin sheds were built using small barren hilltops. In Shaoyang Prefecture, famous for its daylily production, many places are expanding daylily cultivation along the edges of vegetable gardens; other places are using the gaps next to houses to plant oil crops such as sesame and sunflowers. In one production team of the Xiahuaping People's Commune in Shaoyang County alone, 46 mu of sunflowers were sown in the open space in front of and behind houses. Now, a movement to utilize empty spaces to plant melons, beans, and oil crops is also underway in towns and cities. Recently, 8,000 cadres from various agencies in Chen County mobilized to intensively plant melons and sunflowers on residential open spaces, averaging 19 seedlings per person.

There are many small scattered plots of land that can be utilized in the rural areas of Hunan. Last year, members of the Maogang People's Commune in Dayong County utilized barren mountains and gaps in front of and behind houses to plant pumpkins, harvesting a total of over 9.2 million jin, increasing net income by more than 180,000 yuan. This year, commune members are highly motivated to plant pumpkins in their spare time. Currently, the entire commune has planted more than 660,000 seedlings, resulting in 45 "pumpkin mountains."

In order to further mobilize the enthusiasm of commune members in sowing early-maturing crops such as melons and vegetables, people's communes generally assign the task of sowing early-maturing crops to canteens and work teams, implementing a system of contracted labor, contracted production, contracted costs, and rewards for overproduction. They also advocate that canteens make extensive use of empty spaces to plant various grains, melons, vegetables, and other early-maturing crops. In early March, when arranging grain work and implementing grain rations contracted to canteens, people's communes in Shaoyang Prefecture generally adopted a "three contracts and one reward" system for early-maturing crops, and the entire area quickly sowed more than 550,000 mu of crops such as potatoes and more than 180,000 mu of melons and vegetables. At the same time, on the principle of not affecting collective production, localities allow commune members to use their spare time to plant melons and vegetables in the gaps next to their homes, implementing a system of self-planting and self-harvesting, which has greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members in planting melons, vegetables, and other crops.

Xinhua News Agency reported that many counties in Heilongjiang Province are mobilizing the masses to use idle land such as next to houses, roadsides, and ditch edges to plant oil crops, in addition to the planned planting area for small oil crops. Youths in Bayan, Nenjiang, and Qinggang counties have already planted more than 5,000 mu of oil crops such as sunflowers. In order to increase the production of small oil crops, Kedong County will sow 30,000 mu according to the national plan this year, and also intercrop flax in 290,000 mu of soybean land, and plant flax on all the headlands of 440,000 mu of crops such as sorghum, millet, and corn.

　　湖南·黑龙江
　　充分利用零星地种瓜种菜种油料
    本报长沙16日电　湖南各地在大抓春耕插秧工作的同时，正发动广大社员抓季节抢种瓜菜等早熟作物，争取寸土不闲。到4月6日止，全省已播种春荞、马铃薯、玉米等早熟作物二百二十多万亩；种瓜菜约一百多万亩。仅据郴县专区统计，就利用屋前屋后隙地种南瓜二千一百八十二万蔸，还在一千九百多万条田埂、水圳边播种了豆子。湘西地区许多人民公社开展了“户户百蔸瓜”的南瓜山运动。仅据凤凰、吉首等七个县统计，利用小荒山头种南瓜一千五百多万棚。以产黄花菜著名的邵阳专区，许多地方利用菜园边扩种黄花菜；还有些地方利用宅旁隙地种芝麻、向日葵等油料作物。单是邵阳县下花坪人民公社一个生产队就利用屋前屋后空地播种向日葵四十六亩。现在，利用空坪隙地种瓜种豆种油料的运动也在城镇中开展起来了。郴县各机关干部最近出动八千人，在住宅空地上突击种瓜种向日葵，平均每人种了十九蔸。
    湖南农村可以利用的小块隙地很多。大庸县茅岗人民公社去年社员利用荒山和屋前屋后隙地种南瓜，共收九百二十多万斤，增加纯收入十八万多元。今年社员利用工余时间种南瓜的积极性很高。现在，全公社已种六十六万多蔸，出现了四十五个“南瓜山”。
    为了进一步调动社员播种瓜菜等早熟作物的积极性，各地人民公社一般把早熟作物播种任务包到食堂和作业组，实行包工、包产、包成本和超产奖励的办法，并提倡食堂大量利用空坪隙地种植各种杂粮、瓜菜等早熟作物。邵阳专区各人民公社在3月初安排粮食工作、实行口粮包干到食堂的同时，对早熟作物普遍采取了“三包一奖”制度，全区很快播种马铃薯等作物五十五万多亩、瓜菜十八万多亩。同时，各地在不影响集体生产的原则下，允许社员利用工余时间在宅旁隙地种瓜菜，实行自种自收的办法，也大大调动了广大社员种瓜菜等作物的积极性。
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省许多县在小油料作物计划种植面积以外，发动群众利用宅旁、路边、沟沿等空闲地块种植油料。巴彦、嫩江、青冈三县的青少年已经种植了五千多亩向日葵等油料作物。克东县为了更多地增产小油料，今年除按国家计划播种三万亩外，还要在二十九万亩大豆地中普遍套种线麻，在四十四万亩高粱、谷子、玉米等作物的地头上全部种上线麻。
