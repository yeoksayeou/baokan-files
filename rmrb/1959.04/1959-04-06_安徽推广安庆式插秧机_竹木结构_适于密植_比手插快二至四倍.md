Anhui Promotes Anqing-Style Rice Transplanters
    Bamboo and Wood Structure, Suitable for Close Planting, Two to Four Times Faster than Manual Planting

    (Our correspondent in Hefei, April 4th) Anhui Province is rushing to produce Anqing-style rice transplanters before rice transplanting. The province strives to use rice transplanters for 60% of its rice paddies this year. At present, more than 38,000 rice transplanters have been manufactured in the province, with an average of more than 30 rice transplanters per people's commune.

    This year, Anhui will plant a total of 47 million mu of rice, an increase of 13 million mu over last year. Labor will be very tight during the rice transplanting period. One Anqing-style rice transplanter, operated by three people, can transplant five to seven mu of rice per day, which can improve work efficiency by two to four times compared with manual transplanting. This not only replaces the heavy rice transplanting labor, but also saves a large amount of labor and completes the rice transplanting in a timely manner.

    The Anqing-style rice transplanter was collectively created by the Anqing Prefectural Committee Agricultural Implement Research Group. Research began in June 1958, and after 107 trials and improvements, it was finally successful. In January of this year, after on-site comparison with various rice transplanters, it was decided to promote it throughout the province. Its body is entirely made of bamboo and wood, and ordinary carpenters can manufacture it. It also has the advantages of light pulling force, material saving, high efficiency, and low cost. This rice transplanter is also suitable for close planting requirements, planting straight, without damaging the seedlings or causing them to float.

    In the work of promoting the Anqing-style rice transplanter in Anhui Province, special emphasis is placed on the quality of manufacturing. It is required that from material selection, manufacturing, to acceptance, every cadre responsible for this work, every manufacturer, should profoundly understand the great political and economic significance of making good rice transplanters from a ideological perspective, carefully grasp the specifications, and carry out manufacturing without the slightest difference.

    In order to solve the problem of materials needed for manufacturing rice transplanters, various places have mobilized the masses to find solutions and use substitutes as much as possible. For example, the Agricultural Implement Research Office of the Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory, according to the instructions of Comrade Zeng Xisheng, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, successfully tested the use of bamboo poles instead of steel wire, and the effect was very good after being adopted by various places.

    In the work of promoting rice transplanters, from the province to the special districts and most of the counties, early greenhouse seedling cultivation and trial transplanting have been carried out, so that the broad masses of cadres and people have seen its actual effect. Therefore, their enthusiasm for manufacturing and promoting rice transplanters is very high, and the progress is very fast.

    安徽推广安庆式插秧机
    竹木结构　适于密植　比手插快二至四倍
    本报合肥4日电　安徽省在插秧前，正大量赶制安庆式插秧机，全省今年60％的稻田力争要用插秧机插秧。目前全省已制造插秧机三万八千多部，每个人民公社平均已有三十多部插秧机。
    今年安徽共种植水稻四千七百万亩，比去年增加一千三百万亩。在插秧期间劳动力将十分紧张。一个安庆式插秧机三人操作，一天可以插秧五亩到七亩，比人工手插能提高工效两倍到四倍。这样不但代替了繁重的插秧劳动，而且还可以节省大批劳力，及时完成插秧。
    安庆式插秧机是安庆地委农具研究组集体创造的，自1958年6月开始研究，经一百零七次试验改进，终于获得成功。在今年1月经过和各种插秧机实地评比，决定在全省推广。它的机身全部是竹木结构，一般木工都能制造，同时具有拉力轻、用材省、效率高、成本低等优点。这种插秧机还适合密植要求，插得直，不伤秧漂秧。
    安徽省在推广安庆式插秧机工作中，特别强调制造的质量。要求从选料、制造，一直到验收，使每一个负责这一工作的干部，每一个制造者，都从思想上深刻了解造好插秧机的重大政治意义和经济意义，认真掌握规格，一分一厘不差地进行制造。
    为了解决制造插秧机所需材料问题，各地都发动群众找窍门，尽量采用代用品。如省农业机械厂农具研究室根据省委第一书记曾希圣同志的指示，试验用竹杆代替钢丝成功，经各地采用后效果很好。
    在推广插秧机工作中，从省到专区和大部分的县，都经过提前温室育秧，进行试插，使广大干部和群众都看到了它的实际效果，因此对制造和推广插秧机的积极性很高，进度很快。
