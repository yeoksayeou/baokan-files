Socialist Countries' Economic Construction Develops Rapidly
    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 7th: Romanian workers are launching a socialist labor emulation drive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 industrial production plan, and have already achieved considerable success.
    At the beginning of this year, the workers of Romania's largest iron and steel industrial enterprise, the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine, proposed to steelworkers nationwide to strive to produce an extra 100,000 tons of steel for the country above the plan this year. At the same time, eight industrial enterprises in Bucharest also launched a competition movement nationwide to "achieve maximum savings." These initiatives quickly gained enthusiastic response from factories and enterprises throughout Romania.
    From the first day of the competition, news of overfulfilling production plans and savings plans has been constantly coming from all over Romania. From the beginning of this year to mid-March, the steelworkers of Hunedoara had already overproduced 12,300 tons of steel. The Lei Xia Steel Combine has increased the amount of steel tapped from open hearth furnaces from 3.89 tons per furnace to 6.7 tons.
    By the beginning of March, the "achieve maximum savings" movement had saved the country nearly one billion lei nationwide.
    Many other factories and enterprises in Romania's heavy and light industries are also overfulfilling production tasks.
    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 7th: The Central Statistical Bureau of Romania recently published a communique on the results of the implementation of the 1958 national economic plan.

    社会主义国家经济建设飞速发展
    罗马尼亚工人热烈展开社会主义竞赛
    去年经济计划超额完成　今年更大胜利在望
    据新华社布加勒斯特7日电  罗马尼亚工人正在展开争取完成和超额完成1959年工业生产计划的社会主义劳动竞赛，并已取得不少成就。
    在今年年初，罗马尼亚全国最大的钢铁工业企业洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂的职工向全国钢铁工人提出了争取在今年超计划多为国家生产十万吨钢的倡议。同时，布加勒斯特的八个工业企业也向全国发起了“实现最大的节约”的竞赛运动。这些倡议很快就获得了罗马尼亚各地工厂企业的热烈响应。
    从竞赛展开的第一天起，罗马尼亚各地就不断传来超额完成生产计划和节约计划的消息。洪尼多阿拉的炼钢工人从今年年初到3月中旬已经超额生产了一万二千三百吨钢。累希擦钢铁联合工厂已经把平炉的出钢量由每炉炼钢三点八九吨提高到六点七吨。
    “实现最大的节约”运动到3月初已经在全国范围内为国家节约了近十亿列依。
    罗马尼亚重工业和轻工业的其他许多工厂企业也都在纷纷超计划完成生产任务。
    新华社布加勒斯特7日电　罗马尼亚国家中央统计局最近发表了关于1958年国民经济计划执行结果的公报。公报指出，罗马尼亚去年在发展国民经济和提高居民的物质和文化福利方面取得了显著的成就。

    在农业方面，集体农业有了相应的发展。截至1958年年底，集体农庄和共耕社的耕地面积为四百零三万九千公顷，比1957年增加了20％，共有农户一百八十五万五千户，比1957年增加28％。1958年农业新装备了一万八千二百一十台拖拉机、玉米播种机和联合收割机，此外，还增设了一些其它农业机器设备。
    在商品流通方面，城乡劳动人民的消费量也有所增加。如工人家庭肉的消费量增加了9.1％，牛奶的消费量增加了7.1％；而农村中肉的消费量增加了13％，糖的消费量增加了23.2％。

    公报指出，罗马尼亚1958年整个经济建设的投资总额近一百五十亿列依，比1957年增加8％。（附图片）
    1959年罗马尼亚在化学工业方面的投资将占国民经济投资总额的20％。戈沃腊化工厂是正在建设中的化学工业企业中的一个。这个厂在建成后每年将生产十五万吨钠的化合产品。建筑工程预计将在今后两、三年内完成。这是建筑工地一角。
