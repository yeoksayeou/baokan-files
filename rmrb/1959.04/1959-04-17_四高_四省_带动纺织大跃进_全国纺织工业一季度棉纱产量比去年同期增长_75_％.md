Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The "Four Highs" and "Four Savings" movement carried out by the national textile industry system has powerfully promoted the development of the textile industry. In the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year, textile industry output increased by 75.2% for cotton yarn, 46.1% for cotton cloth, 46.21% for woolen fabrics, and 32.48% for knitting wool. Product quality has also improved compared to the fourth quarter of last year.

The "Four Highs" (high speed, high output, high quality, high technology) and "Four Savings" (saving electricity, saving raw materials, saving labor, saving financial resources) movement carried out by the textile industry system was proposed at the National Textile Bureau Directors Conference held in November last year. In order to achieve the "Four Highs" and "Four Savings," since the beginning of this year, textile enterprise workers in various regions, under the leadership of factory and enterprise Party organizations, have been vigorously carrying out technical revolutions, fiercely attacking weak links in current production, and solving key production problems. Cotton mills concentrated their efforts on tackling yarn breakage and machine downtime. After a series of efforts, yarn breakage and machine downtime have been generally reduced in various factories. Many enterprises, under high-speed operation, have reduced fine yarn breakage from 300 or even more than 300 ends to below 150 ends. The production efficiency of fine yarn machines has increased from 90% or below to about 95%.

In order to break through production bottlenecks, many enterprises grasped the crucial link of machinery maintenance and repair at the beginning of the movement, mobilizing maintenance workers, operating workers, and production team leaders to cooperate in a comprehensive overhaul of the machines. After collective research and adoption of measures, combing machine maintenance workers at Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 increased the doffer speed from 16 revolutions per minute to 30 revolutions per minute, doubling combing production compared to the original. Maintenance workers at Tianjin State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6 collaborated with leather roller workers and used their brains to change the leather roller replacement operation from one person handling both unloading and loading to two people working on an assembly line, one unloading and one loading. This not only shortened the maintenance cycle but also greatly reduced yarn breakage.

Carrying out the expert worker movement is another important measure for textile enterprises in various regions to achieve "Four Highs" and "Four Savings." Textile systems in many regions have launched a large-scale "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced" red flag competition, with factories competing against factories, workshops against workshops, shifts against shifts, groups against groups, and individuals against individuals. They all set up platforms, held skill demonstrations, and contributed ideas, ensuring that every group had a model worker and everyone had a competitor, observing and demonstrating to each other, and selecting expert workers. All the workers of Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory participated in the expert worker selection competition, and the workshops conducted examinations according to the expert worker indicators. As a result, 949 people in the factory reached the expert worker standard, accounting for 84.7% of the total number of workers participating in the selection. After 300 city-wide parallel drawing, roving, fine yarn, and weaving operation experts in Shanghai, including Yi Shijuan, Huang Baomei, and Qian Fendi, proposed launching a red flag competition, 380,000 textile workers in Shanghai were full of enthusiasm and high morale. Everyone diligently studied and practiced hard to become expert workers. In order to quickly master advanced operating methods, workers used spare time before and after shifts to establish "sister contracts" and "apprentice contracts" to teach and learn from each other. As a result, new expert workers appeared in batches, and labor productivity steadily increased. At Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 13, the number of expert fine yarn tenders increased from the original 16 to 208, accounting for 68.4% of the fine yarn tenders. The operating skills and spindle-watching capabilities of these expert workers have been significantly improved. Many fine yarn tenders have also learned to repair machines and so on through the expert worker movement.

While carrying out mass movements, textile enterprises in various regions have strengthened various aspects of enterprise management, establishing and improving machinery maintenance, quality inspection, raw cotton management, temperature and humidity management, and technical safety systems as needed.

At present, the "Four Highs" and "Four Savings" movement in the national textile industry system is continuing to develop, and the broad masses of workers are throwing themselves into the second quarter's production upsurge with even greater enthusiasm.

　　“四高”“四省”带动纺织大跃进
　　全国纺织工业一季度棉纱产量比去年同期增长75％
    新华社16日讯　全国纺织工业系统开展的“四高”、“四省”运动有力地推动了纺织工业的发展。今年第一季度纺织工业产量同去年同期相比，棉纱增长了75.2％，棉布增长了46.1％，毛织品增长了46.21％，绒线增长了32.48％。产品质量也比去年第四季度有了提高。
    纺织工业系统开展的四高（高速度、高产量、高质量、高技术）、四省（省电力、省原材料、省劳动力、省财力）运动，是在去年11月份召开的全国纺织厅局长会议上提出的。为实现“四高”、“四省”，今年以来，各地纺织企业职工在工厂、企业党组织领导下大闹技术革命，猛攻当前生产上的薄弱环节和解决生产关键问题。棉纺厂集中力量围攻断头和停台，经过一系列工作，现在各厂的断头和停台现象普遍减少，不少企业在高速运转的情况下，细纱断头从三百根甚至三百根以上下降到一百五十根以下，细纱机的生产效率由90％或90％以下已提高到95％左右。
    为了突破生产关键，许多企业在运动一开始时就抓紧维护和检修机械这个主要环节，发动保全工、运转工和生产组长共同合作，对机器进行全面整顿。郑州国棉二厂梳棉保全工人经过集体研究采取了措施，将梳棉机道夫由每分钟十六转加到三十转，使梳棉产量比原来增加一倍。天津国棉六厂保全工人与皮辊工人协作，开动了脑筋，把换皮辊的操作，由过去一个人管卸又管上，改为二个人流水作业，一人卸一人上，不但缩短了保全保养的周期，还大大减少了断头。
    开展能手运动，是各地纺织企业实现“四高”、“四省”的另一个重要措施。许多地区纺织系统掀起了一个声势浩大的“学先进、赶先进”的红旗竞赛热潮，厂与厂、车间与车间、班与班、小组与小组、个人和个人，都大摆擂台，比武献计，做到了组组有标兵，人人有对手，互相观摩表演，选拔能手。北京市第一棉纺织厂职工人人参加能手的选拔赛，车间按能手指标进行了考试。结果，全厂有九百四十九人达到能手标准，占参加选拔职工总人数的84.7％。上海市三十八万纺织职工在裔式娟、黄宝妹、钱芬娣等全市三百名并条粗纱、细纱、织布的操作能手提出开展红旗竞赛倡议之后，意气风发，斗志昂扬，个个勤学苦练竞做能手。工人们为了尽快地掌握先进操作法，利用班前班后空隙时间，订立“姐妹合同”、“师徒合同”互教互学，因而新能手成批出现，劳动生产率稳步上升。上海国棉十三厂在细纱挡车工的能手由原来十六人，增加到二百零八人，占细纱挡车工的68.4％。这些能手的操作技术和看锭、看台能力都有显著的提高。许多细纱挡车工还通过能手运动，学会了修理机器等。
    在开展群众运动的同时，各地纺织企业都加强了企业的各项管理工作，根据需要建立与健全了机器保全保养、质量检查、原棉管理、温湿度管理和技术安全等制度。
    目前，全国纺织工业系统的“四高”、“四省”运动还在继续发展，广大职工正在以更大的干劲投入第二季度的生产高潮。
