Dalai Lama Takes a Drive in a Car with the Curtains Drawn
AFP Says It Was to Prove Freedom of Movement

(Dispatch from our newspaper) AFP, Mussoorie: The Dalai Lama, accompanied by his so-called "close advisors," took his first car ride on April 27th for about an hour.

AFP said that although the sun was shining brightly that day, the car's curtains were drawn. It is said that the Dalai Lama will go for a drive every day to confirm Nehru's recent statement that the Dalai Lama has complete freedom to go anywhere he wants.

    达赖坐着拉上窗帘的汽车兜风
    法新社说是为了证明有行动自由
    本报讯　据法新社穆索里消息：达赖喇嘛4月27日在他的所谓“亲密的顾问”陪同下，第一次乘汽车出去“兜风”，约一小时。
    法新社说，这天虽然阳光灿烂，汽车的窗帘却都拉上了。据说，达赖喇嘛每天要出去兜风，以证实尼赫鲁最近所发表的声明，尼赫鲁曾声明，达赖喇嘛有到任何他想去的地方去的完全自由。
