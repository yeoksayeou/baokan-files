A New Teacher-Student Relationship Has Been Established
Committee Member Chen Zhongfan Discusses Inspiration Gained from Higher Education Reform
I have heard Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's CPPCC report and other reports, and I completely agree with and sincerely support them. Now, I would like to briefly discuss the inspiration I have received from the reform of higher education:

The Tremendous Changes in Higher Education
In the year and a half since the victory of the anti-Rightist rectification campaign across the country, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people has been flourishing, setting off a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The higher education sector is no exception. After the "double-anti" campaign, confiding in the Party, and the criticism of academic thought, the vast majority of faculty and staff have realized the harm of bourgeois individualism, enhanced their socialist and communist awareness, and earnestly carried out ideological transformation, which has brought about relatively profound changes in the overall appearance of the schools, greatly inspiring me, as manifested in the following aspects.

Now, starting with Nanjing University, where I serve: Since the autumn of 1958, in order to implement the Party's education policy, Nanjing University has achieved certain results in teaching reform, productive labor, and scientific research. Taking work-study programs as an example, the science departments have produced 2,700 new products, many of which belong to cutting-edge science and have reached international standards. In addition to participating in steelmaking, the three liberal arts departments have written more than 1,000 papers criticizing academic thought; history students have gone deep into the countryside to write factory histories and cooperative histories; Chinese language students have collected more than 500 folk songs in the countryside and written a variety of scripts reflecting reality, helping folk artists to organize a large number of storytelling materials.

Due to my age and physical condition, I was unable to participate in steelmaking or run factories and farms. I could only follow the provincial CPPCC inspection team to visit various places, witnessing the workers and peasants who worked hard day and night, regardless of time and conditions, and the faculty and students of colleges and universities who, after practical training in productive labor, established labor viewpoints and mass viewpoints, thus becoming strong-willed and unafraid of all difficulties in their march towards science. This made me realize that the buds of communist factors are constantly growing, and I could not help but feel excited, determined to follow in their footsteps and learn from their example. However, how did the facts manifest themselves?

A Twist in My Own Thinking
Since 1955, I have been teaching the history of Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing literature in the Chinese Department of Nanjing University, and I have written more than 300,000 words of lecture notes. After 1957, I handed over this course to young teachers, and I planned to spend a year revising them all and help the young teachers do a good job in selecting and annotating works and teaching. Unexpectedly, since the criticism of academic thought was put forward last autumn, all my lecture notes were negated, and my entire ideological system was criticized as belonging to the bourgeois category, with fundamental errors. This sudden blow greatly shocked me. My self-confidence wavered and eventually disappeared. I thought that I would give up teaching from now on, study Marxism-Leninism hard, and engage in ideological transformation through practical labor within my capabilities. After the transformation has been somewhat successful, I could then devote myself to scientific research, or perhaps still be able to do my meager best. This negative mood filled my consciousness.

At that time, the department sent the big-character posters written by students and the articles criticizing me. I calmly read them in detail and felt that they could indeed use the weapon of Marxism-Leninism to seriously identify, analyze, and criticize the standpoints, viewpoints, and materials in the lecture notes. They were able to release arrows with a target, which could be said to be bitter medicine for me. I had to write an article of self-criticism, reviewing in detail all the feudal and capitalist ideas of the past. However, I still could not build up confidence for the future. After that, the department still invited me to attend meetings to examine the thoughts of each teacher. The result was that the more lecture notes one wrote, the more and greater criticism one received. Conversely, it was relatively slight. The department leaders also criticized me for thinking that I should only be "red" but not "expert," which was wrong. Because I can still rely on the Party, believe in the Party's words, and follow the Party, this semester they opened a specialized course for me - Yuan Dynasty Zaju (a form of Chinese opera). Although I accepted the task, I was cautious, preparing to continue to accept criticism and come up with a few more self-examinations. I knew that when I returned to the classroom, I saw more than eighty students listening attentively and burying themselves in writing notes. This could not help but surprise me, deeply ashamed of my limited ideological level. I have not been able to constantly enrich the little knowledge I possess with the correct scientific and revolutionary viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism, and I can't help but fail their expectations.

The New Teacher-Student Relationship
As for the teaching syllabus compiled by the students collectively, it was also sent to me for review on schedule. Generally speaking, I felt that they could stand firm, and their views were novel. However, when analyzing each specific aspect concretely, there were still many problems. I thought it was not necessary to pour cold water on them, which would affect their enthusiasm, and I was reluctant to offer too many opinions. By the time I participated in several discussion meetings and heard all the faculty and students of the department repeatedly debating each other in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, until finally a more comprehensive conclusion was reached, everyone felt satisfied. Only then did I realize that teaching work should be a political task jointly undertaken by teachers and students. Teachers should play a positive leading role in teaching, while also giving play to students' initiative, creativity, and ability to think independently, and becoming equal and comradely teacher-student relationships in the face of truth. In this way, teachers can humbly listen to and absorb the opinions and criticisms of the masses and improve their teaching. They can learn from lecturing and strive to advance from learning. The ancients said, "Learn then know inadequacy; teach then know difficulty. Knowing inadequacy then can reflect on oneself; knowing difficulty then can strengthen oneself." From "reflecting on oneself" to "strengthening oneself" is a necessary and arduous process. This process of great destruction and then great construction must be experienced to achieve the state of "teaching and learning from each other," so that the quality of teaching can be continuously improved, the Party's education policy can be effectively implemented, and the work of building teaching materials can be done well. This is the initial establishment of a new teacher-student relationship from the new teaching methods, which has greatly inspired me.

The teacher-student relationship is not only about "imparting knowledge and resolving doubts," but also about "transmitting the Dao" - transmitting the Dao of socialism and communism - to be considered to have fulfilled the responsibility of education. Then, the old saying of feudal society that "teachers must be strict for the Dao to be respected" cannot be used. We must establish common thoughts and feelings with students before we can discuss morality of collectivism with each other. Because I am infirm and unable to go to the students' dormitories to go deep into the masses, I cannot talk about understanding the masses, let alone living and learning together with the masses. However, through the contact with lecturers and teaching assistants, I also deeply realize that the current students have participated in productive labor and enriched their current practical experience, and their requirements for traditional indirect knowledge and theory are also more strict and higher. Therefore, they urgently require teachers to join hands with them and improve together, so that culture and science can be developed rapidly. Recently, Nanjing University convened a representative meeting of teachers, students, and staff, and I also heard a student representative say: "Teachers are our guides. Because we have extremely high expectations for our teachers, we also have higher and more urgent requirements. We see the ideological transformation of our teachers as our own transformation, and we see the progress of our teachers as surpassing our own progress." Hearing such sincere remarks, all concerns were swept away. I am determined to put down my airs, open up the situation, and, under the care of the Party, establish a comradely relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation with the students, work hard to do a good job in teaching, and unite as one to build socialism together.

A New Situation in Scientific Research
As for scientific research, it was previously thought that only senior teachers with broad and profound knowledge could engage in it. Now, young students have broken superstitions and liberated their minds. They have the courage to break the rules and regulations and dare to compete with senior teachers. And according to the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, they dare to climb the peak of science and compare their heights with international standards. This heroic spirit has broken the old habits of each respecting what they hear, closing the door to build a cart that may not be suitable when going out; and it has also abandoned the bad habits of master and slave and flaunting sectarianism. Now, under the leadership of the Party, senior teachers, young teachers, graduate students, refresher students, and senior students discuss together. For each important issue, they put forward different opinions, engage in heated debates, and through mutual enlightenment, supplementation, and correction, arrive at a unified conclusion. This is really incomparable to the past research methods based on individual subjective and one-sided methods with serious limitations. It has also reversed the bourgeois direction of scientific research that was divorced from reality, politics, and the masses in the past, and established the direction of "valuing the present over the past" and "making the past serve the present." It has closely integrated scientific research with current social reality and political struggle, written critical papers, and compiled and organized old and new scripts, realizing the two "three-way combination" policies, thereby establishing the spirit of communist collective cooperation, and at the same time improving the relationship between young and old teachers. This is another inspiration for me.

I am a member of a democratic party. Our Central Committee of the China Democratic League is now responding to the Party's call, requiring members to "combine political thought as the commander, the work post as the base, and labor practice as the foundation" to transform their thinking. My personal experience is that the new teaching methods and scientific research methods in schools have changed the old teacher-student relationship and the relationship between young and old teachers. Only in this way can we combine work with practical experience, constantly engage in the struggle between two roads, two methods, and two worldviews with classmates and colleagues, thereby recognizing the correct direction and road, contributing our limited wisdom and strength, and actively participating in the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, so that we can effectively engage in the fundamental transformation of our political stand.

In summary, in the ten years since liberation, following the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, with the education of the Party and the help of the masses, our bourgeois intellectuals have also undergone fundamental changes in teaching and scientific research, which has promoted self-transformation. Only in this way is it possible to exert more, greater, and better strength in school education, democratic party work, and all aspects, and make a certain contribution to socialist construction.

Whether the above personal opinions are appropriate or not, I would like to ask all committee members to criticize and correct them!

    新的师生关系建立起来了
    陈中凡委员谈在高等教育改革中受到的启发
    我听到周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李维汉副主席的政协报告等各项报告，完全同意，并衷心拥护。现在就我在高等教育改革中所受到的启发，略加陈述：
    高等教育的巨大变化
    在这一年半以来，全国人民经反右整风获得胜利后，革命的积极性日益蓬勃的发展，掀起了工农业生产大跃进的形势。高等教育界不能例外，经过双反、向党交心和学术思想批判，绝大多数教职员工认识到资产阶级的个人主义的危害性，提高了社会主义和共产主义的觉悟，认真进行思想改造，使学校的整个面貌发生了比较深刻的变化，使我受到极大的启发，表现在下列各个方面。
    现在从我服务的南京大学说起：南大自一九五八年秋季起，为了贯彻党的教育方针，在教学改革、生产劳动、科学研究各方面取得了一定的成绩。就勤工俭学说：理科方面制成了二千七百种新产品，其中不少项目属于尖端科学，达到国际水平。文科三系除参加炼钢铁外，写出学术思想批判的论文一千多篇；历史系学生深入农村，编写了工厂史、合作社史；中文系学生在农村中采辑了民歌五百余首，编写出反映现实的剧本多种，帮助民间艺人整理出大批的说唱材料。
    我因为年龄和体质的关系，既未能参加炼钢铁，又不能办工厂、农场，只有随着省政协的考察团，在各地参观访问中，亲眼看到那些不计时间，不论条件，日夜苦干，忘我劳动的工农群众，看到高等学校的师生，经过生产劳动的实际锻炼，树立了劳动观点、群众观点，因而意志坚强，不怕一切困难向科学进军。使我认识到共产主义因素的萌芽正在不断地生长，不禁心情振奋，立志要追随他们的后尘，学习他们的榜样。但是，事实表现怎样呢？
    自己思想上的一个曲折
    我自一九五五年以来，在南大中文系担任宋元明清文学史课，编写过三十多万字的讲稿。到一九五七年后，把这课交给青年教师继续担任，我拟用一年的时间、精力，全部加以修订，并满怀信心地帮助青年教师做好作品选注和教学工作。不料自去秋提出学术思想批判，竟把我编写的讲稿全部否定，并进而批判了我的整个思想体系属于资产阶级范畴，是有根本性的错误的。这一当头棒喝，使我受到极大的震动，我的自信心由动摇而至于丧失，以为从此就放弃教学工作，努力学习马克思列宁主义，并通过力所能及的劳动实践，从事思想改造，等改造稍有成就，而后再埋头于科学研究，或者还能勉尽棉薄之力吧。由此消极的情绪充满了我的意识。
    当时系里把学生写的大字报和批判我的文章送来，我平心静气地详加阅读，觉到他们确能运用马列主义的武器，对讲稿中的立场、观点和材料，加以严肃地鉴别、分析和批判，乃能针对我的缺点放出有的之矢，对于我可说是一剂苦口的良药。只得写了自我批判的文章，对于过去所有的封建主义和资本主义的思想详加检讨，对于今后的信心还是树立不起来的。此后系里开会仍照旧邀我出席，检查每一个教师的思想，结果是编写讲稿愈多的受到的批判也就愈多愈大，反之则比较轻微，系领导并批判我今后想只红不专是不应该的。因为我还能依靠党、相信党的话，并跟着党走，这学期又为我开了专门化的课程——元人杂剧。我虽然接受任务，但怀着戒备的心情，准备继续接受批评，再来几次自我检讨吧。那知我重到课堂时，看到八十多个学生都凝神听讲，而且埋头写笔记。这不能不使我感到惊异，深愧自己的思想水平有限，还未能用马列主义科学性和革命性的正确观点，不断丰富我所占有的一点知识，不免有负他们的厚望。
    新的师生关系
    至于学生集体编写的教学大纲，也按期送来，给我审核，从大体上看，觉得他们能站稳立场，见解是新颖的。但就各具体方面作具体的分析，存在的问题也不少。我以为不必泼他们的冷水，致影响他们的积极性，不愿多提意见。及至参加过几次讨论会议，听到全系师生们各本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神，彼此反复辩论，直到最后得到比较全面的结论，大家都感到满意为止。到此，我才认识到教学工作应该是师生共同努力的政治任务，教师应该在教课中起积极主导作用，同时发挥学生的主动性、创造性和独立思考的能力，彼此在真理面前成为平等的同志式的师生关系。这样，教师才能虚心倾听并吸取群众的意见和批评，改进自己的教学。才能从讲授中学习，从学习中力求前进。古人所谓“学然后知不足，教然后知困；知不足然后能自反，知困然后能自强。”由“自反”而到“自强”，是个必要的艰苦的过程，必须经历这一由大破到大立的过程才能达到“教学相长”的地步，使教学质量不断提高，有力地贯彻党的教育方针，做好教材建设工作。这就是从新的教学方法中初步建立起新的师生关系，使我受到莫大的启发。
    师生关系，不仅是“授业解惑”，而且要“传道”——传社会主义和共产主义之道，才算完成教育的责任。那就不能用封建社会“师严然后道尊”的旧说，必须和学生建立共同的思想感情，而后才能以集体主义的道义相切磋。我因为不良于行，不能亲到学生宿舍，深入群众，就谈不到了解群众，更不能和群众共同生活，共同学习了。但是，通过讲师助教的联系，也深切地认识到现在的学生因为参加了生产劳动，丰富了当前的实际经验，对于传统的间接知识和理论要求也就更加严格，更加提高了，故迫切要求教师和他们携手并进，共同提高，使文化科学得到迅速的发展。最近南大召开了师生员工代表会议，又听到学生代表说：“教师是我们的领路人，我们因为对于老师的期望极殷，故要求也比较更高更切。我们看到老师的思想改造如同自己的改造，看到老师的进步，甚于自己的进步。”听到这样的诚恳发言，把一切顾虑扫除净尽，立志保证放下架子，打开局面，在党的关怀下和同学们建立同志般的互助合作的师生关系，为做好教学工作而努力，为共同建设社会主义而团结一致。
    科学研究工作的新局面
    至于科学研究工作，从前认为只有宏通淹博的老教师才能从事，现在青年学生破除迷信，解放思想，他们就有胆量打破陈规戒律，敢于和老教师较量高低。并根据土洋并举原则，敢于攀登科学的尖端，和国际水平比较个高低。这种豪迈的气概，打破了从前人们各尊所闻，闭户造车出门未必合辙的陋习；更抛弃了入主出奴，标榜门户的恶劣作风。现在是在党的领导下，老年教师、青年教师、研究生、进修生和高年级学生共同商榷，对于每一重要问题，各提出不同的意见，展开热烈的争论，由互相启发、补充、纠正，得到统一的结论，比较个人各凭主观片面的，带有严重局限性的研究方法，实在不可同日而语。并扭转了过去科学研究脱离实际、脱离政治、脱离群众的资产阶级方向，确立了“厚今薄古”和“古为今用”的方向。使科学研究和当前的社会现实与政治斗争密切结合，写出批判性的论文，编写和整理出新旧的剧本，实现了两个“三结合”的方针，从而树立了共产主义集体协作的精神，同时改进了青老教师的关系。这对于我又是一种启发。
    我是民主党派的成员，我们中国民主同盟中央现在响应党的号召，要求成员“以政治思想为统帅，以工作岗位为基地，以劳动实践为基础的三结合”来改造思想。我亲身的体验，学校中新的教学方法和科学研究的方法，改变了旧日的师生关系和青老教师的关系，才能在工作中结合业务实践，不断与同学同仁们展开两条道路、两种方法和两种世界观的斗争，从而认识到正确的方向和道路，贡献出自己有限的智慧和力量，积极投入技术革命和文化革命，才能切实有效地从事政治立场的根本改造。
    总上所述：解放十年来，我们资产阶级知识分子随着工农业大跃进之后，在党的教育和群众的帮助之下，对于教学和科学研究也起了根本的变化，对于自我改造起了促进作用。这才有可能在学校教育、民主党派工作和各方面发挥更多更大更好的力量，对于社会主义建设作出一定的贡献。
    以上个人的意见，是否有当，还求各位委员予以批评和指正！
