Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 5th: In order to cover up their illegal acts of infringing on China's territorial sovereignty under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities in South Vietnam had no choice but to hastily release the eighty-one fishermen (previous reports stated eighty-two, with one fisherman released earlier) whom they had abducted from Chenhang Island in China's Xisha Islands on February 22nd. During the fifteen days of illegal detention and imprisonment, these fishermen were subjected to numerous abuses and unreasonable interrogations. After returning to the various islands of the Xisha Islands on March 9th, they have been holding meetings for days to angrily denounce and protest the piratical behavior of the South Vietnamese authorities, demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities apologize to China for this incident, compensate for the losses, and immediately cease all acts of infringing on any islands in China's Xisha Islands.

According to the accusations of the victimized fishermen against the South Vietnamese authorities, after the South Vietnamese naval armed personnel invaded Chenhang Island on February 22nd, they rudely tore down the national flag from our fishing boats. The landing armed personnel cut off the flagpole ropes on the island, tore down the national flag, discarded it on the ground and defiled it at will. The South Vietnamese naval armed personnel concentrated the abducted fishermen on Coral Island and escorted them to Da Nang, South Vietnam, by gunboat on February 23rd. After arriving in Da Nang at 11:00 on the 24th, they were immediately imprisoned. The South Vietnamese authorities arbitrarily insulted the abducted fishermen, "punishing" them by making them stand in the sun and forcing them to "stand at attention" to the South Vietnamese flag. Illegal interrogations were conducted on Chinese fishermen, and during the "interrogations," they probed the "military situation" and "internal situation" of the Xisha Islands in many ways, and used both threats and inducements to openly ask the fishermen to "voluntarily" stay in South Vietnam, inciting them to defect from the motherland. This act of infringing on China's territorial sovereignty and insulting the dignity of the Chinese nation aroused great anger among the returning fishermen. The Xisha Islands have always been Chinese territory. Li Ruimao, an old fisherman who has been producing in the Xisha Islands for generations, said: "The Xisha Islands have always been a part of the motherland. Our ancestors have been producing in the Xisha Islands for generations, and I myself have been in the Xisha Islands for more than thirty years. We cannot tolerate anyone infringing on the territory of the motherland and insulting our national flag." In order to force the fishermen to reveal information about the Xisha Islands, the South Vietnamese armed personnel confined the doctor Feng Shihua to the bow of the gunboat and exposed him to the sun for as long as three hours. On the evening of February 22nd, the eighty-one fishermen were forcibly concentrated on the "Qionganzhuang" fishing boat under the guns of the South Vietnamese navy. The fishermen were not allowed to bring clothes or bedding, nor were they allowed to use their own rice and firewood to cook. The South Vietnamese navy claimed that they would shoot immediately if they cooked. That night, the abducted fishermen squatted on the deck, hungry and cold, suffering through the night. The next day (23rd), the South Vietnamese navy locked the fishermen in the dirty bottom of the gunboat cabin and in the toilets. From February 22nd to 24th, the abducted fishermen were hungry for forty-eight hours. After the fishermen were imprisoned in the South Vietnamese prison, they were not given bedding or luggage, and they were forced to sleep on the cold cement floor. On February 25th, the South Vietnamese authorities conducted "interrogations" of the fishermen, and those who refused to answer the illegal interrogations were placed in solitary confinement. When the fisherman Li Fugen was in solitary confinement, he only had one meal in twelve hours. After the protest from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the questioning of the abducted fishermen on February 27th, the South Vietnamese authorities, in order to cover up their crimes, began to give the fishermen enough food to eat from February 28th, and then announced their release, and said to the fishermen: "We were wrong to capture you, we are going through the procedures to send you back."

The fishermen suffered huge losses during the robbery by the South Vietnamese navy. At 10:30 on February 22nd, South Vietnamese armed personnel surrounded the warehouses and residences on Chenhang Island, and then entered houses to search door-to-door, ransacking boxes and cabinets, and looting wantonly. The assets and materials looted from the island and fishing boats included: 2,400 catties of rice; 1,480 catties of diesel and engine oil; 1,500 yuan in cash; one radio; 2,541 dan of aquatic products (agar, dried fish, etc.); fishing gear, machine parts, clothing (clothes, bedding, watches, pens, etc.) as well as canned food, candy, food, medicine, etc. from the Xisha branch of the supply and marketing cooperative were all looted by the South Vietnamese navy. In addition, five large and small fishing boats were robbed, including the "Qionganzhuang," a motorized sailing boat with a load of 40 tons, which was completely damaged and sunk. Although the remaining four were released, they were so badly damaged that they could no longer be used. The robbery of the fishermen and fishing boats has caused significant losses in production. Preliminary statistics, including the looted materials, total a loss of approximately 550,000 yuan. In order to cover up the piratical behavior of the South Vietnamese authorities, when they were forced to release the fishermen, the South Vietnamese navy forced the fishermen to sign pre-prepared "documents," forcing the fishermen to admit that they "had not been abused" and "had not suffered losses," and so on.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 5th: At about 12:00 on March 26th, a South Vietnamese aircraft invaded and circled over Chenhang Island for reconnaissance. Subsequently, the South Vietnamese gunboat HQ05 invaded the vicinity of Chenhang Island and sent a small boat carrying sixteen South Vietnamese soldiers to rob the three fishing boats "Guannan," "Haifuli," and "Qiongyu 0044," robbing the fishermen of a batch of watches and clothing, and breaking a "compass" (navigation instrument). Then the sixteen South Vietnamese soldiers went ashore to search and question the fishermen, threatening them that they would shell the island and destroy the fishermen's houses.

In addition, at around 10:00 on March 12th, a Japanese fishing boat (FK5502) carried out a piratical attack on Beidao Island in the Xisha Islands, destroying the fishermen's houses and looting a batch of furniture and fishing gear.

    西沙群岛遭受迫害的渔民
    愤怒控诉南越当局的海盗行为
    新华社广州5日电　南越吴庭艳当局为了掩饰他们在美帝国主义操纵下侵犯我国领土主权的非法行为，不得不匆匆忙忙地把他们于2月22日从我国西沙群岛中的琛航岛上劫走的八十一个渔民释放（前报被劫八十二人，其中一名渔民被先行放回）。这批渔民在十五天的非法扣留和监禁中，受到诸多虐待和无理的审问。他们于3月9日回到西沙群岛各岛后，连日来纷纷集会，忿怒地控诉和抗议南越当局的海盗行为，要求南越当局就此次事件向我道歉，赔偿损失，并立即停止对我西沙群岛中任何岛屿的侵犯活动。
    据我受害渔民对南越当局的控诉书揭露，南越海军武装人员于2月22日侵入我琛航岛以后，粗暴地扯下我渔船上的国旗。登陆的武装人员砍断岛上旗杆绳索，把国旗扯下抛弃地面任意污毁。南越海军武装人员将我被劫渔民集中到珊瑚岛，于2月23日由南越炮艇押运去南越岘港，24日十一时抵岘港后即把他们关进监牢。南越当局对我被劫渔民任意侮辱，“罚”他们晒太阳和强迫他们对南越当局的旗帜“罚站”。对我国渔民进行非法审问，在“审问”中还多方刺探我西沙群岛的“军事情况”和“内部情况”，并且威胁和利诱兼施，公开要我渔民“自愿”留在南越，煽动他们叛离祖国。这种侵犯我国领土主权和侮辱我国家民族尊严的暴行，引起归来的渔民们的极大忿怒。西沙群岛一向是中国的领土。几代人都在西沙群岛生产的老渔民李瑞茂说：“西沙群岛从来就是祖国的一部分，我们祖祖辈辈都在西沙群岛生产，我本人在西沙群岛也有三十多年。我们不能容忍任何人侵犯祖国的领土和侮辱我们的国旗”。南越武装人员为了逼迫我渔民说出西沙群岛的情况，把我医生冯世华禁在炮艇头上曝晒太阳达三小时之久。2月22日晚上，我八十一个渔民在南越海军的枪口下，被强制集中到“琼安庄”号渔船上，不准渔民携带衣被，也不准渔民用自己船上的柴米烧饭，南越海军声言如果烧饭立即开枪，这一夜我被劫渔民又饿又冷地蹲在船面苦苦熬夜。第二天（23日），南越海军将我渔民关闭在空气污浊的炮艇舱底和厕所里，从2月22日至24日，我被劫渔民整整饿了四十八小时。我渔民被关进南越监牢后，不给他们铺盖行李，让他们宿在冰冷的水泥地上。2月25日南越当局对我渔民进行“审问”，对拒绝回答非法审问的渔民采取单独“禁闭”，渔民李福根在单独“禁闭”时，十二小时内只吃到一顿饭。2月27日在我外交部抗议和我被劫渔民的质问后，南越当局为了掩盖罪行，从2月28日起才让我渔民吃饱饭，随即宣布释放，并且对我渔民说：“我们捉你们是错了，办手续放回去”。
    我国渔民被南越海军劫掠中，损失巨大。2月22日十时半，南越武装人员包围了琛航岛上的仓库和住宅，然后入屋逐户搜查，翻箱倒柜，大肆掠夺。岛上和渔船上被劫走的资财有：大米二千四百斤；柴油、机油一千四百八十斤；现款一千五百元；收音机一部；水产品（石花菜、鱼干等）二千五百四十一担；渔具、机件、衣物（衣被、手表、钢笔等）以及供销社西沙分销店的罐头、糖果、食品、药品等被南越海军掠夺一空。此外，被劫大小渔船五艘，其中载重四十吨的机帆船“琼安庄”号全部损毁沉没。其余四艘虽已放回，因损坏严重，已不能使用。由于我渔民和渔船被劫，使生产蒙受了重大损失，初步统计，连同被劫走的物资在内，一共损失约值人民币五十五万元以上。为了掩盖南越当局的海盗行为，在被迫释放我渔民时，南越海军竟强迫我渔民在事先拟制的“文件”上签字，强迫我渔民承认“没有受到虐待”，“没有受到损失”等等。
    新华社广州5日电　3月26日十二时左右，南越飞机一架，侵入我琛航岛上空盘旋侦察。随后，南越ＨＱ05号炮艇侵入琛航岛附近，放下小艇载有十六名南越士兵，对我“冠南”、“海福利”、“琼渔0044”三渔船进行抢劫，劫去我渔民手表、衣物一批，并打碎“罗经”（航海仪器）一个。接着十六名南越士兵上岸搜查和盘问我渔民，威胁我渔民说，他们要向岛上开炮，炸毁我渔民的房屋。
    又讯，3月12日十时左右，有日本渔船（ＦＫ5502号）一只，在我西沙群岛中的北岛进行海盗式的偷袭，捣毁我渔民房屋，劫走我渔民的家具和渔具一批。
