Xinhua News Agency, 11th: New York dispatch: The American "New York Times" published an editorial on the 7th, threatening the Bolivian government in an aggressive tone to obey the instructions of the U.S.-controlled "International Monetary Fund": abolish the resale agencies that provide miners with cheap goods in exchange for so-called "aid" from the United States.

The "New York Times" editorial, which blatantly interferes in Bolivia's internal affairs, was published after the tin miners in the country went on strike again, demanding that the government restore the resale system. According to the newspaper, the resale agencies in various mining areas were closed on the 1st of this month. However, more than 10,000 tin miners in three locations, including Catavi, held a protest strike the next day. The miners and their families took to the streets chanting slogans such as "Death to U.S. Imperialism!"

　　玻利维亚矿工愤怒罢工
　　高呼打死美帝国主义
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：美国“纽约时报”7日发表社论，以咄咄逼人的口吻要挟玻利维亚政府听从美国控制的“国际货币基金组织”的指令：取消供给矿工以廉价物品的代售机构以换取美国的所谓“援助”。
    “纽约时报”这篇露骨地干涉玻利维亚内政的社论是在这个国家的锡矿工人再度进行罢工、要求政府恢复代售制度后发表的。据这家报纸报道，在本月1日，各矿区的代售机构都停业了。但卡塔维等三地一万多名锡矿工人在第二天就举行了抗议罢工。矿工们和他们的家属曾涌向街头高喊“打死美帝国主义”等口号。
