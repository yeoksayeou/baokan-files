    Spring Sowing of Economic Crops Begins in Henan
    Spring sowing of economic crops such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and oil-bearing crops has begun in Henan Province, on both sides of the Yellow River. In Xinxiang Prefecture, where spring sowing started earlier, tobacco seedlings are growing very vigorously. Comprehensive transplanting will begin in half a month; some areas have already begun sowing cotton.

    In order to strive for a bumper harvest of economic crops, most of the more than 12 million mu of cotton fields and more than 1.5 million mu of tobacco fields planned for sowing in Henan Province this year have been deeply ploughed to a depth of eight inches, and peanut and sesame fields have also been universally deep-ploughed. On average, about 10,000 jin of base fertilizer has been applied per mu, and seeds have basically been improved. Sowing and management are also carried out in accordance with the seven requirements put forward by the Provincial Party Committee based on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture."
  Handun Yellow River Diversion Sluice Opens for Water Release
    The Handun Yellow River Diversion Sluice, one of the four major Yellow River irrigation projects in Shandong Province, has opened to release water. People's communes in the irrigation area have organized irrigation professional teams to divert Yellow River water day and night to irrigate the land. The Handun Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project is located at the tail end of the Yellow River. The diversion sluice is built near Handun in Huimin County. When the entire project is completed, it can irrigate 3.2 million mu of farmland. The six reservoirs under construction will become several huge artificial lakes within the irrigation area. After the power station is built, electricity can be used as a driving force for the development of rural industry and for lighting for the masses. After the canals at all levels form river locks, navigation will be possible between the county and the people's communes.
      Rice Seedling Protectors
    More than 800 weather outposts and weather observation groups in Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, are generally busy. Based on weather forecasts and their own observations, they study local weather changes every day. Through more than 1,400 weather liaison officers, they report weather conditions in a timely manner, allowing rice seedling protectors to take measures in time to do a good job in rice seedling field care.

    河南经济作物开始春播
    河南省黄河两岸棉花、烤烟、油料等经济作物的春播工作已经开始。春播动手较早的新乡专区，烟苗生长非常茁壮，半月以后，全面的移栽工作即将开始；个别地区已开始播种棉花。
    为争取经济作物丰收，河南省今年计划播种的一千二百多万亩棉田和一百五十多万亩烟地，大部分都深翻了八寸，花生、芝麻田也都普遍深犁了一遍。大部分田平均每亩上底肥一万斤左右，在种子方面，也基本实现了良种化。并按照省委根据“八字宪法”提出的七项要求进行播种和管理。
  韩墩引黄闸开闸放水
    山东省四大引黄灌溉工程之一——韩墩引黄闸开闸放水。灌区各人民公社都已组织灌溉专业队，引黄河水日夜浇地。韩墩引黄灌溉工程位于黄河尾部。引黄闸建筑在惠民县韩墩附近。这项工程全部建成后，可灌溉农田三百二十万亩。正在施工的六处水库，将成为灌区境内几个巨大的人造湖。电站建成后，电力可作农村发展工业的动力和供群众照明。各级渠道形成河闸以后，县和人民公社之间都能通航。
      护秧尖兵
