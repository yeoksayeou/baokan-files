Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th -- The repeated high-altitude flights of US aircraft over Berlin at altitudes exceeding 10,000 feet have once again strained Anglo-American relations.

It is reported that the British Chargé d'Affaires in Washington has lodged a strong protest with the US government against this action. The British Foreign Office stated that the US government did not consult with the British government and only notified it of the flight shortly before the aircraft took off.

According to today morning's "Daily Express," this indicates "a dangerous vacuum has emerged in the highest levels of US policy decision-making," in the British view. The conservative newspaper warned in its editorial today that if this matter "is allowed to develop unimpeded, it will threaten peace."

The "Daily Mirror" editorial condemned the Americans for playing with fire. The newspaper said that meddlesome American generals are playing with fire again, doing so after explicit assurances were given to British Foreign Secretary Lloyd that the US government would no longer permit such flights. The newspaper also said that these American generals "are interfering in politics—to prove that they are ready to confront Russia, and at this time, this interference is most likely to damage the chances of peace."

The newspaper emphasized: "This is an intolerable situation. Macmillan should immediately notify President Eisenhower to stop this military madness."

　　英国不满美国在柏林玩火
　　对美机在柏林高空飞行提出抗议
    新华社伦敦16日电　美国飞机又一次在柏林一万英尺以上的高空飞行，这种行径再度引起英美关系的紧张。
    据报道，英国驻华盛顿代办已经向美国政府提出强硬抗议，反对这种行动。而英国外交部说，美国没有同英国政府商量过，只是在飞机起飞前不久才把关于这次飞行的事情通知它。
    据今天上午的“每日快报”说，在英国看来，这说明“在美国政策的最高决策者方面出现了危险的真空”。这家保守的报纸在今天的社论里警告说，如果这件事情“得以毫不受阻碍地发展下去，就会威胁和平”。
    “每日镜报”的社论谴责美国人在玩火。这家报纸说，多事的美国将军们又在玩火了，他们是在人们向英国外交大臣劳埃德作了明确的保证之后这样干的。人们曾经保证：美国政府将不再允许作这种飞行。报纸还说，这些美国将军“正在干预政治——以证明他们已经准备同俄国摊牌，在这个时候，这种干预最能够损害和平的机会。”
    这家报纸强调指出：“这是不可容忍的情况。麦克米伦应当立即通知艾森豪威尔总统制止这种军事狂。”
