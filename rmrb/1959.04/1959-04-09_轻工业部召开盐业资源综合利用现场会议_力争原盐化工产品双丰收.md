The Ministry of Light Industry Convenes On-Site Meeting on Comprehensive Utilization of Salt Resources
    Striving for a Double Harvest of Crude Salt and Chemical Products

    (Our newspaper, Chengdu, April 8th) The Ministry of Light Industry recently convened a national on-site meeting on the comprehensive utilization of salt resources in Zigong City. The meeting determined: it is necessary to organize a great leap forward in the salt industry, produce more chemical products, and support industrial and agricultural production. The meeting also arranged the crude salt production and capital construction tasks for the first half of this year. At the meeting, Li Zhuchen, Minister of the Ministry of Light Industry, reported on the principles and tasks of comprehensive utilization of salt resources this year; representatives from Sichuan, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Hebei, Guangdong and other places introduced their experiences in vigorously carrying out technical revolution, comprehensively utilizing salt resources, and tapping the potential of salt field equipment.

    Based on the needs of national economic construction for salt chemical products, and the fact that salt departments still have many resources that have not been fully utilized, the meeting requested that the production of salt chemical products be grasped tightly from the beginning of this year. The meeting especially emphasized that salt departments should take care of the overall situation and arrange the production tasks of various products according to their importance and urgency. The meeting decided that priority should be given to the production of chemical products such as potassium chloride and bromine, which are closely related to the metallurgical, pharmaceutical and other departments; the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides should not be relaxed either. The meeting pointed out that the comprehensive utilization of salt resources must resolutely implement the policy of walking on two legs. At present, we should first do a good job in consolidating and improving existing small, indigenous salt chemical plants, and further strengthen popularization. After visiting various salt plants and chemical plants in Zigong City, the representatives believed that small, indigenous salt chemical plants can not only produce simpler products such as indigenous chemical fertilizers, but also produce more complex chemical products. While grasping the "small indigenous groups," we must also grasp the capital construction of large and medium-sized chemical plants, so that these plants can quickly be put into production and become the backbone of comprehensive utilization of salt resources. The meeting also requested that various localities proceed from their own reality according to the needs of local industrial and agricultural production, so that each salt field and salt plant can gradually become a comprehensive chemical industry base "taking salt as the key link." The meeting requested that all localities must strive to complete and overfulfill this year's crude salt production tasks, and make unified arrangements for various productions, so as to achieve a double harvest of crude salt and chemical products.

    轻工业部召开盐业资源综合利用现场会议
    力争原盐化工产品双丰收
    本报成都8日电　轻工业部最近在自贡市召开了全国盐业资源综合利用现场会议。会议确定：要组织盐业工业大跃进，生产更多的化学产品，支援工农业生产。会议还安排了今年上半年的原盐生产和基本建设任务。会上，轻工业部部长李烛尘报告了今年盐业资源综合利用的方针和任务；四川、江苏、辽宁、河北、广东等地的代表，介绍了大闹技术革命，综合利用盐业资源，以及挖掘盐场设备潜力的经验。
    根据国家经济建设对盐业化工产品的需要，以及盐业部门还有许多资源没有充分利用的情况，会议要求今年一开始就抓紧盐业化工产品的生产。会议特别强调盐业部门要照顾全局，根据轻重缓急来安排各项产品的生产任务。会议决定，要优先生产同冶金、医药等部门有密切关系的氯化钾、溴素等化学产品；化学肥料、农药的生产也不能放松。会议指出，盐业资源的综合利用必须坚决贯彻两条腿走路的方针。当前首先应该作好现有小土盐业化工厂的巩固提高工作，并且进一步加强普及。代表们在自贡市各盐厂和化工厂参观后认为，小土盐业化工厂不仅可以生产土化肥等较简单的产品，还可以生产比较复杂的化工产品。在抓“小土群”的同时，还要抓紧大中型化工厂的基本建设，使这些工厂迅速投入生产，成为综合利用盐业资源的骨干。会议还要求各地根据本地区工农业生产的需要，因地制宜，使每个盐场、盐厂都能逐步成为“以盐为纲”的综合性化学工业基地。会议要求各地必须力争完成和超额完成今年的原盐生产任务，统一安排各项生产，作到原盐、化工产品双丰收。
