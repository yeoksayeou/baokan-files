Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd. The Tsinghua University School Affairs Committee recently commended a group of advanced teachers, staff, and students. They are all activists who have conscientiously implemented the Party's education policy and have made significant achievements in ideological transformation, teaching, production labor, scientific research, or cultural and sports activities since last year.

Among the thirty-three teachers commended, Zhang Zigao, the seventy-year-old director of the Department of Engineering Chemistry, actively helped young teachers use dialectical materialism to impart chemical knowledge to students by organizing them to study Marxist philosophy, which played a significant role in improving the professional level of young teachers. Li Hengde, an associate professor in the Department of Engineering Physics, constantly transformed himself by linking his own ideological reality when studying Marxist-Leninist works. After conscientiously studying the Party's education policy, he took the lead in establishing factories and revising teaching plans within the department, closely integrating theoretical courses with productive labor. Li Guoding, a lecturer in the Civil Engineering Department, combined the construction site with systematic lectures to students while leading them to work on construction sites outside the school. When students' labor time was inconsistent, he lectured them in batches to ensure the learning of each student. At the same time, he also came up with various technical methods to help students better complete production tasks.

Among the twenty-one advanced student collectives commended, there were all the fourth-year students of the Automobile and Tractor major, who were good at labor and study under the guidance of teachers; there were all the second-year students of the Water Conservancy Department who scientifically arranged various activities and strived to be the best in the five aspects of ideology, reading, labor, scientific research, and cultural and sports activities.

The teachers, students, and staff commended this time were nominated by the staff representative assembly and the student representative assembly of the entire school, and were decided after discussion by the School Affairs Committee. (Attached pictures)

    受表扬的三十三名教师中，七十多岁的工程化学系主任张子高，通过组织青年教师学习马克思主义哲学的方法，积极帮助他们运用辩证唯物主义的观点向学生传授化学知识，对提高青年教师的业务水平起了很大作用。工程物理系副教授李恒德在学习马克思列宁主义著作时，联系自己的思想实际不断改造自己。他在认真地学习了党的教育方针后，就在系内带头办工厂，修改教学计划，使理论课和生产劳动课密切结合。土木系讲师李国鼎带领学生在校外工地上劳动时，结合施工现场给学生们系统地讲课；学生的劳动时间不一致，他就分批地进行讲授，保证了每个学生的学习。同时，他还在技术上想出各种办法帮助学生更好地完成生产任务。
    受表扬的二十一个学生先进集体，有在教师指导下劳动好读书也好的汽车拖拉机专业四年级的全体学生；有科学地安排各种活动，在思想、读书、劳动、科学研究、文娱体育五个方面都争得上游的水利系二年级的全体学生等。
    这次受表扬的教师、学生和职工，是由全校职工代表大会、学生代表大会提名，并经校务委员会讨论后决定的。（附图片）
