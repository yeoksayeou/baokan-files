The subtropical fruits of Fujian, longan, lychee, and citrus, are now in full bloom. This year, the flower buds of longan and lychee are particularly abundant and robust, even better than the flower buds of 1953, the year of the bumper harvest. The province has approximately 147,000 mu of orchards that can be harvested for lychee, longan, and citrus this year.

The Party committees at all levels in the fruit-producing areas have paid close attention to strengthening the leadership of fruit production this year, holding various meetings to review, compare, and exchange experiences. Production teams in the people's communes have established and improved specialized fruit production teams, implementing production responsibility systems such as "contracting for work, contracting for output, contracting for costs," and rewarding above-quota production. The management of orchards has generally been done earlier and better than last year. Currently, the orchards in various regions have generally undergone inter-tillage, weeding, and soil cultivation. Citrus orchards have been fertilized once to three times, and more than 70% have been pruned. Fruit farmers are full of confidence in striving for a greater fruit harvest this year.

　　龙眼荔枝花开满园
    福建的亚热带水果龙眼、荔枝和柑桔，已经花开满园。今年龙眼和荔枝的花芽特别繁茂、健壮，比特大丰收的1953年的花芽还要好。全省今年可以采收荔枝、龙眼和柑桔的果园约有十四万七千多亩。
    水果产区各级党委今年都很注意加强水果生产的领导，召开了各种会议来检查评比和交流经验。各人民公社的生产队都建立和健全了水果专业生产队，实行“包工、包产、包成本”和超额奖励等生产责任制。果园的经营管理工作一般都比去年做得早，做得好。目前各地的果园已普遍进行过中耕除草和培土。柑桔园已下肥一次到三次，并有70％以上已经整好枝。果农们对争取今年水果的更大丰收都满怀信心。
