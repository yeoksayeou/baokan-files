Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: (By our correspondent) The Seven-Year Plan will rapidly propel the Soviet steel industry forward. According to economists, with the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's total iron ore production will catch up with the United States by 1962; total pig iron production will catch up with the United States by 1968; and total steel and rolled steel production will catch up with the United States in 1969 and 1970, respectively.

Due to the rapid development of the Soviet steel industry, the proportion of Soviet iron ore, pig iron, steel, and rolled steel production in the world has been rapidly increasing, while the United States has been declining. For example, in 1940, the Soviet Union's steel production accounted for 13% of the world's total steel production, while the United States accounted for more than 43%. By 1958, the Soviet Union's proportion had risen to almost 20%, while the United States had fallen to about 30%. This trend will continue to develop in the future.

The next seven years will be a period of large-scale development for the Soviet steel industry. Compared with last year, by 1965, the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's pig iron production will increase from 39.6 million tons to 65 million to 70 million tons; steel will increase from 54.9 million tons to 86 million to 91 million tons; and iron ore will increase from 88.8 million tons to 150 million to 160 million tons. During the seven years, the absolute increase in Soviet production of the above-mentioned products will be roughly equal to the absolute increase in the past ten, more than ten, or even twenty years. In the United States, it took approximately twelve or thirteen to more than twenty years to increase pig iron and steel production from roughly the same level as the Soviet Union last year to the level that the Soviet Union will reach in seven years.

It is worth noting that in recent years, the average annual absolute increase in the Soviet steel industry has exceeded that of the United States. During the period from 1959 to 1965, the average annual absolute increase in Soviet iron ore, pig iron, steel, and rolled steel production will be 30% to 60% higher than the average annual absolute increase in the past seven years.

During the Seven-Year Plan period, Soviet investment in new construction and renovation of steel industrial enterprises will exceed the total investment in the past few decades. To accelerate the development of the steel industry in order to win time in the economic competition with the United States, two-thirds of the basic construction investment in the Soviet steel industry in the next seven years will be used to renovate existing factories and iron mines. In order to shorten the construction period of newly built and renovated enterprises, three-fifths of the investment will be concentrated on thirty of the most important construction projects. During the seven years, the production capacity of existing steel enterprises will be greatly increased. For example, the production capacity of the famous Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works will increase by 50% and become the world's largest steel industrial enterprise. The production capacity of the Chelyabinsk Steel Plant will triple, and the pig iron, rolled steel, and steel production of the Lipetsk Steel Plant in Ukraine will be equal to two to twenty times last year's output.

The production capacity of newly built enterprises is also very large. The Soviet Union's third steel industry base, which is being built in the eastern part of the Soviet Union, will be able to produce 7.5 million tons of pig iron annually. Among them, the Karaganda Iron and Steel Integrated Works alone, after its completion in 1964, will have an annual pig iron production equal to the sum of the current annual pig iron production of Italy and India.

The Soviet Union now ranks first in the world in terms of blast furnace and open-hearth furnace productivity. During the Seven-Year Plan period, its steel industry will develop along the lines of building the world's largest metallurgical units. During this period, the Soviet Union will build a total of sixty-five open-hearth furnaces, twenty-five electric furnaces, and thirty converters, with an average of four or five blast furnaces put into production each year. In addition, eighty-two high-yield rolling mills and tube mills will be built. Some of the newly built blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces will have unparalleled production capacity, and the rolling speed and production speed of the newly built rolling mills and tube mills will be higher than the speed of similar equipment currently in the world.

Expanding existing enterprises and building powerful metallurgical units will greatly change the face of Soviet steel industrial enterprises. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the average annual iron production of each Soviet blast furnace will increase from 341,000 tons last year to 543,000 tons; the average annual steel production of each open-hearth furnace will increase from 125,000 tons to 200,000 tons; and each steel plant will produce an average of 836,000 tons of pig iron and 588,000 tons of steel annually, with their average annual production capacity exceeding that of the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th: According to TASS, Moscow: The average annual production rate of Soviet pipe rolling mills now exceeds that of the United States.

Currently, a Soviet pipe rolling mill rolls an average of 62,000 tons of steel pipes per year, compared to 45,000 tons in the United States.

In the next seven years, Soviet-made pipe rolling mills will produce an average of 200,000 tons of steel pipes per year. Within five years after the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will catch up with the United States in steel pipe production.

Designers at the Elektrostal Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant near Moscow have completed the design of a continuous rolling mill that produces 300,000 tons of seamless thin-walled steel pipes annually. This rolling mill can roll 700 meters of steel pipe per minute, or 6,600 steel pipes per hour.

The Soviet steel pipe industry was actually established during the Soviet era. In 1913, before the October Revolution, Tsarist Russia's steel pipe production was only 67,000 tons, while last year the Soviet Union's steel pipe production reached 4.6 million tons.

### 苏联发展钢铁工业气势雄伟  铁矿砂、生铁、钢和钢材分别在四年到十二年内赶上美国  目前在高炉和平炉的生产率方面都已居世界第一位

　　苏联发展钢铁工业气势雄伟铁
　　矿砂、生铁、钢和钢材分别在四年到十二年内赶上美国
　　目前在高炉和平炉的生产率方面都已居世界第一位
    新华社莫斯科17日电　本社记者报道：七年计划将把苏联钢铁工业迅速推向前进。据经济学家计算，随着七年计划的执行，到1962年，苏联的铁矿砂总产量就可以赶上美国；生铁总产量到1968年就将赶上美国；钢和钢材总产量将先后在1969年和1970年赶上美国。
    由于苏联钢铁工业的迅速发展，苏联的铁矿砂、生铁、钢和钢材产量在全世界所占的比重一直在迅速提高，相反地，美国却在降低。例如，1940年苏联的钢产量占全世界钢的总产量的13％，美国占43％以上。而到1958年，苏联的这一比重已差不多上升到20％，而美国则下降到大约30％。这一趋势今后还将继续发展。
    今后七年是苏联钢铁工业大规模发展的时期。和去年比较，到七年计划结束时的1965年，苏联的生铁产量将从三千九百六十万吨增加到六千五百万吨至七千万吨；钢将从五千四百九十万吨增加到八千六百万吨至九千一百万吨，铁矿砂将从八千八百八十万吨增加到一亿五千万到一亿六千万吨。七年间，苏联上述产品的绝对增加量，将大约等于过去十年、十多年甚至二十多年的绝对增加量。而在美国，把生铁和钢产量从与苏联去年大致相同的水平提高到七年后苏联的水平，则大约分别用了十二、三年到二十多年。
    值得注意的是，最近几年，苏联钢铁工业的每年平均绝对增加量已经超过了美国。在1959—1965年期间，苏联的铁矿砂、生铁、钢和钢材每年的平均绝对增产量，还将比过去七年的每年平均绝对增产量多30％—60％。
    七年计划期间，苏联用于新建和改建钢铁工业企业的投资将超过过去几十年的投资总额。为加快钢铁工业的发展速度，以便在同美国的经济竞赛中赢得时间，今后七年间苏联钢铁工业的基本建设投资将有三分之二用于改建现有的工厂和铁矿。为了缩短新建和改建的企业的建设期限，五分之三的投资将集中用于三十个最重要的建设项目中。在七年期间，现有的钢铁企业的生产能力将大大提高。例如，著名的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂的生产能力就将增加50％，而成为世界上最大的钢铁工业企业。车里雅宾斯克钢铁工厂的生产能力将扩大为现在的三倍，乌克兰的利佩茨克钢铁工厂的生铁、钢材和钢产量将等于去年的两倍到二十倍。
    新建企业的生产能力也是很大的。正在苏联东部建设的苏联第三个钢铁工业基地，每年将可以生产七百五十万吨生铁。其中，单是卡拉干达钢铁联合工厂在1964年全部建成后，每年的生铁产量将等于目前意大利和印度生铁年产量的总和。
    苏联在高炉和平炉的生产率方面现在已居世界第一位。七年计划期间，它的钢铁工业将沿着建设世界上最大的冶金机组的方向发展。在这期间，苏联总共将建成六十五座平炉、二十五座电炉、三十座转炉，每年平均将有四、五座高炉投入生产。此外，还将建设八十二座高产轧钢机和轧管机。有些新建的高炉和平炉的生产能力将是举世无双的，新建的轧钢机和轧管机的轧制速度和生产速度，将高于世界上现有的同类设备的速度。
    扩建现有企业和新建强大的冶金机组，这将大大改变苏联钢铁工业企业的面貌。到七年计划结束时，苏联每座高炉每年平均产铁量将从去年的三十四万一千吨增加到五十四万三千吨；每座平炉的每年平均产钢量将由十二万五千吨增加到二十万吨；每个钢铁工厂每年平均将生产八十三万六千吨生铁、五十八万八千吨钢，它们的每年平均生产能力将超过美国。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联轧管机的每年平均生产率现在已经超过了美国。
    现在，苏联一台轧管机每年平均轧制六万二千吨钢管，而美国则为四万五千吨。
    今后七年间，苏联制造的轧管机每年平均生产二十万吨钢管。在七年计划结束以后的五年内，苏联就将在钢管产量上赶上美国。
    莫斯科附近的埃列克特罗斯塔尔重型机器制造厂的设计人员已经完成了年产三十万吨无缝薄钢管的连续式轧管机的设计工作。一台这种轧管机一分钟可以轧制七百公尺钢管，每小时可以轧制六千六百根钢管。
    苏联轧（钢）管工业实际上是在苏维埃政权年代中建立起来的。在十月革命前的1913年，沙皇俄国的钢管产量只有六万七千吨，而去年苏联的钢管产量已达到四百六十万吨。
