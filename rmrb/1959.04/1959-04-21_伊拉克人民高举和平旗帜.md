The Iraqi People Hold High the Banner of Peace
By People's Daily Commentator

    The Second Iraqi Peace Partisans Congress held in Baghdad from April 14th to 17th was a major gathering of the Iraqi people to safeguard peace and defend the republic. The conference discussed and made resolutions on important issues such as further developing the Iraqi peace movement and supporting the struggle to defend peace around the world. At the end of the congress, a large-scale demonstration was held, once again demonstrating the unity and power of the forces of peace, democracy, and national independence in Iraq. This conference is of great significance for further developing the Iraqi peace movement and strengthening the struggle against imperialism and foreign reactionary forces.
    The victory of the Iraqi revolution and the establishment of the Iraqi Republic dealt a heavy blow to the imperialist plan to invade the Middle East. The Iraqi people, who have stood up, with the support of the Arab and world's people, defeated the military aggression of American and British imperialism against the Middle East, and then repeatedly thwarted the subversive conspiracies and interference activities against the Iraqi Republic. The newborn Iraqi Republic has become an important fortress for defending peace in the Middle East. However, imperialism is not reconciled to defeat. After the failure of its armed aggression conspiracy, the United States further signed bilateral military agreements with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, and actively carried out new military deployments with other imperialists to encircle and threaten the Iraqi Republic. Their most vicious conspiracy at present is to try their best to provoke relations between Arab countries in an attempt to undermine the Arab national liberation movement. These activities of imperialism seriously threaten the independence and security of the Iraqi Republic, and also seriously threaten peace in the Middle East. Therefore, the convening of the Second Iraqi Peace Partisans Congress and the further mobilization of the Iraqi people to defend peace and the republic is a powerful response to the new aggression conspiracy of imperialism.
    The Iraqi people have always stood at the forefront of the struggle for peace and national independence. The First Peace Partisans Congress held in July 1954 passed a resolution calling for strengthening the unity of the national ranks, fighting to liberate Iraq from the shackles of imperialism, and supporting the struggle of the people of other Arab countries for independence and freedom, and demanding the easing of international tensions. The current Second Peace Partisans Congress has also announced its support for the principles of the Bandung Conference, the resolutions of the World Peace Council and the Asian-African People's Conference, and the struggle of the Arab people to win and maintain independence. The Iraqi people are closely united around the government headed by Qasim, forming a strong force. Prime Minister Qasim personally attended the conference and delivered a speech, giving extremely high praise to the Iraqi peace and democratic forces, and declaring: "Iraq is a neutral and peaceful country, and it will not launch aggression against any country. But if anyone challenges us and launches aggression against us, we will stop him and defeat his attempt." Prime Minister Qasim's words fully expressed the firm will of the Iraqi people to defend peace and the republic.
    At present, the strength of the Iraqi peace, democracy, and national independence movement has become even stronger. Their just struggle has received the respect and support of the people of the Middle East region and all countries in the world. Although China and Iraq are separated by high mountains and vast seas, our two peoples have long established a close friendship in the struggle to defend peace. With excitement, we, together with peace-loving people all over the world, congratulate the achievements of the Second Iraqi Peace Partisans Congress. We firmly believe that no matter how rampant and insidious imperialism is, it will never be able to block the path of the Iraqi people's progress.

    伊拉克人民高举和平旗帜
    本报评论员
    从本月14日到17日在巴格达举行的伊拉克第二次和平战士代表大会，是伊拉克人民维护和平、保卫共和国的一次重大集会。会议就进一步开展伊拉克和平运动、支持世界各地保卫和平的斗争等重要问题进行了讨论，并作出了决议。在大会结束的时候，还举行了大规模的示威游行，再一次显示了伊拉克和平、民主和民族独立力量的团结和威力。这次会议对于进一步开展伊拉克和平运动，加强反对帝国主义和外国反动势力的斗争，具有重大的意义。
    伊拉克革命的胜利，伊拉克共和国的成立，给了帝国主义侵略中东计划以沉重的打击。站起来了的伊拉克人民在阿拉伯和全世界人民的支持下打败了美英帝国主义对中东的军事侵略，接着又一次再一次地粉碎了对伊拉克共和国的颠复阴谋和干涉活动。新生的伊拉克共和国已成为保卫中东和平的重要堡垒。但是，帝国主义是不甘于失败的。美国在它武装侵略阴谋失败以后，又进一步和土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦签订了双边军事协定，并与其他帝国主义一起积极进行新的军事部署，包围和威胁伊拉克共和国。它们目前最毒辣的阴谋是，竭力挑拨阿拉伯国家的关系，企图破坏阿拉伯民族解放运动。帝国主义的这些活动，严重威胁了伊拉克共和国的独立和安全，也严重地威胁着中东的和平。因此，伊拉克第二次和平战士代表大会的召开，伊拉克人民进一步动员起来，保卫和平、保卫共和国的斗争，正是对帝国主义新的侵略阴谋的有力回答。
    伊拉克人民一直站在争取和平和民族独立斗争的前线。在1954年7月举行的第一次和平战士代表大会就曾通过决议，号召加强民族队伍的团结，为使伊拉克从帝国主义束缚下解放出来而斗争，并声援其他阿拉伯国家人民争取独立和自由的斗争，要求缓和国际紧张局势。现在的第二次和平战士代表大会又宣布支持万隆会议的原则、世界和平理事会和亚非人民会议的决议，支持阿拉伯人民争取和维护独立的斗争。伊拉克人民正在紧密地团结在以卡塞姆为首的政府的周围，形成了一支坚强的力量。卡塞姆总理亲自出席了这次大会，并在会上发表演说，给了伊拉克和平民主力量以极高的赞扬，并宣称：“伊拉克是一个中立的、和平的国家，它不会对任何国家发动侵略。但是如果有谁向我们挑战和对我们发动侵略的话，我们将制止他并且击败他这种企图”。卡塞姆总理的话，充分表达了伊拉克人民保卫和平、保卫共和国的坚决意志。
    目前伊拉克和平、民主和民族独立运动的力量已经更加强大了。他们的正义斗争受到了中东地区和世界各国人民的尊敬和支持。中国虽然和伊拉克远隔高山和大海，但是在保卫和平的斗争中，我们两国人民早已建立起了亲密的友谊。我们怀着兴奋的心情同全世界爱好和平人民一道，祝贺伊拉克第二次和平战士代表大会的成就。我们深信，不管帝国主义如何猖狂阴险，它们绝对阻塞不了伊拉克人民前进的道路。
