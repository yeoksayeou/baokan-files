Flourishing of Five Industries in Fine Weather

　　Spring weather, with gentle breezes and warm sunshine, is the season when all life sprouts, grows, and becomes active. The fields are plowed and planted, trees are planted and sprout, livestock are bred, and chickens, ducks, and fish are hatched. The five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery of the people's communes must all "sow seeds" at this time. The saying "an inch of time is worth an inch of gold" carries even more weight due to the development of diversified operations.

     风和日丽五业兴
     阳春天气，风和日暖，正是一切生命萌芽、生长、活跃的季节。大田在这时候耕种，林木在这时候栽植、发芽，牲畜在这时候配种，鸡鸭鱼在这时候孵化。人民公社的农林牧副渔五业，都要在这时候“播种”。春光一刻值千金，这句话因为开展多种经营而变得分量更重了。
    上：山西五寨县人民最近几年营造了几万亩风沙林，有力地制止了风沙的侵袭。这是二道河河岸的防风沙护田林。
