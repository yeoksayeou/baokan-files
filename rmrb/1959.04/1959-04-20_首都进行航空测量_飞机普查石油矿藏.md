Aerial Surveying Conducted in the Capital
Airplanes Survey Oil Deposits

　　This newspaper reports that the Aerial Surveying Team of the Beijing Administration Bureau of the Civil Aviation Administration of China began aerial photography tasks for Beijing's urban planning in April. This is the first time in our country that aerial photography has been used for urban planning surveying. It will photograph the city appearance, topography, landforms, and buildings of Beijing completely and accurately, providing designers with a reliable basis for urban planning and greatly accelerating the speed of urban planning.

　　In addition, specialized aviation aircraft in our country will conduct large-scale oil prospecting work. This year's prospecting areas include the coastal sea, the Songliao Plain in Northeast China, the Greater Khingan Range, and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The planned prospecting area is 873,500 square kilometers.

　　Using aircraft for oil prospecting on the sea surface is also a first for our country. In the first quarter, specialized aviation aircraft have already conducted exploration of submarine oil deposits on the sea surface along the coast of our country, covering a total area of more than 173,000 square kilometers. Aerial exploration on the sea surface is different from that on land and involves more difficulties. The first is navigation. There are no landmarks on the sea surface to serve as a basis for navigation. During flight, it is only possible to maintain a distance of 500 meters from the sea surface, and the flight altitude cannot be determined according to the undulations of the seabed, but because all the flight personnel used instrument observation, they overcame the difficulties of sea flight and successfully completed the task.

### 首都进行航空测量  飞机普查石油矿藏

　　首都进行航空测量
　　飞机普查石油矿藏
    本报讯　中国民用航空北京管理局航测大队，4月份开始进行北京城市规划的航空摄影任务。这是我国第一次用飞机摄影的方法来进行城市规划的测量工作。它将把北京市的市容、地形、地貌、建筑物完整而又准确的照下来，供给设计人员们做为城市规划的可靠根据，可以大大加快城市规划的速度。
    又讯　我国专业航空的飞机将要进行大规模的石油普查工作。今年的普查地区包括沿海海面、东北松辽平原、大兴安岭及云贵高原。计划普查面积为八十七万三千五百平方公里。
    在海面上使用飞机进行石油普查，在我国还是第一次。在第一季度里，专业航空的飞机已经在我国沿海的海面上进行海底石油蕴藏的探测，总面积为十七万三千多平方公里。在海面进行航空探测与陆地不同，困难较多。首先是领航方面，在海面上没有地标做为领航根据。在飞行时，只能和海面保持五百公尺的距离，不能根据海底的起伏不平而决定飞行高度，但由于飞行人员们全部采用了仪表观测，克服了海面飞行的困难，胜利完成了任务。
