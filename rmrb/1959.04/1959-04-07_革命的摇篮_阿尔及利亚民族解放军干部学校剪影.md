    Revolutionary Cradle
    —Sketches of the Algerian National Liberation Army Cadre School
    In the mountainous regions of liberated Algeria, several new types of military schools have been established. Patriotic youths from all over Algeria study combat, command, and revolutionary principles in these schools. There are intellectuals from Algeria, as well as workers and farmers from Oran and Tébessa. This is the Algerian National Liberation Army's cadre school, the revolutionary cradle of Algeria.
    "El Moudjahid," the organ of the Algerian National Liberation Front, recently introduced the situation of a cadre school of the Algerian National Liberation Army.
    In the cadre school introduced by "El Moudjahid," there are a total of 300 students, most of whom are between the ages of twenty and twenty-three, and generally have two to three years of combat experience.
    Upon arrival at the school, they begin intensive study. The study at the cadre school is divided into three stages. The first stage is basic training. The basic training curriculum includes technical training and combat training, lasting approximately seven or eight weeks. Because most of the weapons of the Algerian National Liberation Army are seized from the French colonial army, technical training focuses on learning to use various types of weapons. Combat training includes assaults in plains or mountainous areas, night attacks, bayonet fighting, air defense, reconnaissance, and so on.
    After the basic training is completed, various specialized trainings are conducted. The shortest of these is medical training, which lasts for one month. Due to the vastness of the war zone, the arduousness of combat missions, and the shortage of medical personnel, the responsibility of each medical personnel is extremely heavy. People receiving medical personnel training must not only possess the knowledge of ordinary medical personnel, but also need to learn the ability to perform emergency surgery. After being trained, they immediately set off to work in the war zone.
    Specialized training also includes training for various arms of service, which requires students to be familiar with all aspects of modern warfare strategy and tactics. During the seven or eight weeks of specialized training, students need to master a specialized military skill, either becoming excellent gunners or becoming demolition experts.
    The third stage of training lasts longer. This is combat command training. Each student must learn how to conduct trained, organized, specialized, technical, and coordinated combat with various arms of service. During this stage of training, students will conduct a series of combat exercises and must have the ability to independently command a combat unit to launch daytime attacks against the enemy.
    In the cadre school, in addition to combat training, there is also political education. Students often discuss the significance and situation of the Algerian national liberation war and issues related to the world political situation. From these discussions, they further realize that they—the soldiers of the Algerian National Liberation War—are bound to win victory because they are waging a just war and have the support of the people of all countries in the world. The students study with unparalleled enthusiasm, seriously and joyfully. They are ready at all times to severely strike the French colonialists, and they are determined to plant the flag of national independence and freedom throughout Algeria.

    革命的摇篮
    ——阿尔及利亚民族解放军干部学校剪影
    在阿尔及利亚解放区的山区里设立着若干所新型的军事学校。从阿尔及利亚各地来的爱国青年，在这些学校里学习战斗，学习指挥，学习革命道理。这里有来自阿尔及利亚的知识分子，也有从阿兰和德培萨等地来的工人和农民。这里是阿尔及利亚民族解放军的干部学校，阿尔及利亚的革命的摇篮。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关报“圣战者报”，不久以前介绍了阿尔及利亚民族解放军的一所干部学校的情况。
    在“圣战者报”所介绍的这所干部学校里，共有三百名学员，他们的年龄大都为二十岁至二十三岁，一般都有两年到三年的战斗经验。
    他们一到学校就要开始紧张的学习。干部学校的学习分为三个阶段。第一个阶段是基本训练。基本训练的课程包括技术训练与战斗训练，时间约为七、八个星期。由于阿尔及利亚民族解放军的武器大部分是从法国殖民军手中缴获的，因此，技术训练侧重学习使用各种类型武器。战斗训练的项目有：在平原或山地进行的袭击、夜袭、白刃战、防空、侦察等等。
    基本训练结束以后，就进行各种专门训练，其中学习期间最短的是为期一个月的医护训练。由于战区的广大、战斗任务的艰巨、医护人员的不足，每一个医护人员的责任十分繁重。接受医护人员训练的人不但要具备普通医护人员的知识，还需要学习进行紧急外科手术的本领。他们受训以后就立即出发到战地工作。
    专门训练还包括有各兵种的训练，这种训练要求学员们熟悉现代战争的战略和战术的各个方面。在进行专门训练的七、八个星期内，学员们需要掌握一种专门的军事技术，或成为优秀的炮手、或成为爆破专家。
    第三阶段的训练历时较长。这是战斗指挥的训练。每一个学员必须学会如何进行有训练、有组织、专门化、技术化和各兵种协同一致的战斗。在这个阶段的训练时期，学员们要进行一系列的战斗演习，必须具有独立指挥一个战斗单位向敌人进行白昼袭击的能力。
    在干部学校里，除了战斗训练以外，还有政治教育。学员们经常要讨论有关阿尔及利亚民族解放战争的意义及其形势和关于世界政治形势的问题。从这些讨论中，他们进一步认识到他们——阿尔及利亚民族解放战争的战士们，必然要获得胜利，因为他们进行的是正义的战争，而且得到了全世界各国人民的支持。学员们以无比的热情，严肃而又愉快地进行着学习。他们时时刻刻准备着狠狠地打击法国殖民者，他们决心要把民族独立和自由的旗帜插遍阿尔及利亚全境。
