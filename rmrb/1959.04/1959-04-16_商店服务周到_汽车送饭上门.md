Thoughtful Store Service
    Cars Deliver Meals to Your Door

    The car in the picture on the right is a car specially used by the Moscow Frunze Avenue Culinary Store to deliver meals to customers. Chef Taranosov is putting the meals into the car. The car is emblazoned with: "Save time, please accept the services of the Culinary Store!"

    This culinary store on Frunze Avenue is one of only seven such new-style stores in Moscow. Its main business is supplying ready-made meals, which the store delivers to the door or customers pick up and take home to eat. Many residents nearby pick up their meals on their way home from work. The store has five hundred food boxes ready for customers to use to hold their meals. Meals can be bought on the spot, or ordered in advance. If you don't have time to come, you can order by phone. The store's staff are enthusiastic and attentive in their service to customers, and they have a good understanding of the tastes of many regular customers, such as which family likes their food saltier, and which family prefers it more greasy. Therefore, the food is increasingly satisfying to customers.

    The store also sells semi-finished dishes and snacks. If you have time on a given day, you can buy some semi-finished products and make them yourself at home. In short, the store tries its best to make things convenient for customers. How can such a store not be popular with residents? As one of the store's regular customers, a female teacher, said well: "The culinary store is simply my liberator, it frees me from a large part of my housework." (Attached picture)

    商店服务周到
    汽车送饭上门
    右边图片上的这辆汽车，是莫斯科伏龙芝大街烹饪商店专门为顾客送饭菜的汽车，厨师塔拉诺索夫正把饭菜放进汽车里去。汽车的车身上写着：“节约时间，请接受烹饪商店为您服务！”
    伏龙芝大街的这所烹饪商店，是莫斯科市仅有的七个这种新型商店中的一个。它的主要业务是供应现成饭菜，商店把饭菜送上门去或者由顾客亲自取回家去吃。附近很多居民，都是下班后顺便取饭回家去吃。商店预备有五百个菜盒，供顾客盛饭菜用。饭菜可以临时买，也可以预订，没有时间来，可以打个电话预订。商店的服务员热情而细心地为顾客服务，他们对许多老主顾的口味都摸清了，比如哪家爱吃口重些，哪家喜爱油腻等等。因此，饭菜越来越使顾客满意。
    商店还卖菜的半制品和点心。如果你这一天有时间，就可以买些半制品回家自己去做。总之，商店想尽办法使顾客便利。这样的商店怎能不受居民的欢迎呢？商店的一位老主顾——女教师说得好：烹饪商店简直是我的解放者，它使我摆脱了一大部分家务劳动。（附图片）
