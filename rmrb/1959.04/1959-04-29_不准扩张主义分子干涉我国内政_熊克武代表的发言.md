Let No Expansionist Elements Interfere in Our Internal Affairs
Speech by Representative Xiong Kewu

Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates:

I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," and fully agree with Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the First National People's Congress." I pledge to fulfill my responsibilities and contribute my strength in the struggle to fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 plan.

Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," as pointed out by the People's Daily, is "an epic summarizing the Great Leap Forward and a clarion call to further leaps forward." It comprehensively and vividly portrays the ever-changing face of our great motherland and centrally reflects the unparalleled grand aspirations of our people. After listening to the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, I have a more concrete understanding of our country's national economic development plan for 1959. This is a plan for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, a model of combining soaring ambition with scientific analysis. I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, through the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country, the 1959 plan will certainly be fulfilled and overfulfilled as scheduled, and our just cause will surely achieve new and greater victories in 1959!

The Great Leap Forward of 1959 is truly unprecedented. I participated in the inspection work in Beijing this time, and although I live in Beijing all year round, I also had the feeling of "how long has it been, the landscape is unrecognizable." I have a separate report on the content of the inspection, so I won't list the facts here. What moved me the most was the soaring enthusiasm of the working people and their communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. Under the glorious light of the general line for building socialism, in order to rapidly change the backwardness of the motherland and their hometowns, and for the happiness of themselves and their descendants, they are engaged in selfless and creative labor, making our motherland experience changes of one day equaling twenty years. This makes me more deeply aware of the glory, greatness, and correctness of the Communist Party and the superiority of the socialist system; aware of how great the vitality of the emerging people's communes is; aware of how the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people is surging higher and higher, and how their wisdom and strength are infinite. As someone over seventy years old, recalling the difficult days of groping in the dark in the past few decades, and facing such a rapidly changing and prosperous situation in the motherland today, the excitement in my heart and the love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are beyond words. The more I love our motherland and the Communist Party, the more I hate, despise, and scorn imperialism and all reactionaries. They try every possible means to sabotage our just cause, and when they cannot deny the facts of our Great Leap Forward, they distort and slander our Great Leap Forward in various ways. As the saying goes, "Ivory doesn't grow from a dog's mouth." The imperialists' rumors and provocations only show their exhausted tricks, their ignorance, and their infinite fear of our cause. Let the imperialists tremble in the face of our Great Leap Forward. No matter how they clamor and struggle, they cannot stop us from getting better day by day. Similarly, they cannot save themselves from rotting day by day!

Since the First Session of the First National People's Congress, especially after the nationwide rectification movement and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists, the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country has been unprecedentedly strengthened. This unity is based on the leadership of the Communist Party as the core and socialism as the foundation, so it is as solid as a rock and unshakable. The power generated by this unity is invincible and all-conquering. Whoever tries to undermine this unity will immediately be regarded as the public enemy of the people of the whole country and completely isolated among all ethnic groups. Whether it is domestic or foreign enemies, if they ignore the power of this unity, they will surely be bruised and battered in the face of this unity. Recently, the former Tibet local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, in violation of the wishes of the broad masses of the Tibetan people, launched an armed rebellion betraying the motherland and undermining unity. Their shameful end is the most powerful proof. I grew up in Sichuan, which is adjacent to Tibet, and I know deeply the cruel exploitation and suffering suffered by the Tibetan compatriots under the serf system. Their demand for social reform and to get rid of the shackles of the serf system is completely understandable, and we should fully support it. Premier Zhou Enlai hopes in his report that all well-intentioned friends, if they truly sympathize with the Tibetan people, should sympathize with the vast majority of the Tibetan working people who are oppressed by the old system. This is a kind wish of our people across the country, especially the Tibetan people. Only such sympathy is true sympathy, and only such sympathizers are our true friends. The great Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate any expansionists interfering in our internal affairs under the guise of sympathizing with the Tibetan people and harming the fundamental interests of the Tibetan people. The complete crushing of the Tibetan reactionary clique's rebellion has opened a new page in Tibetan history. The wheel of history cannot be turned back or stopped.

The delegates to the Second National People's Congress include representatives from a wider range of fields than in the past, which powerfully proves that the people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party is more consolidated and developed. The Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class, and it is selfless and impartial. All policies and measures are based on the interests of the 600 million people. It has always resolutely united all forces that can be united, and the purpose of which is to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern culture as soon as possible. Therefore, anyone who sincerely accepts the leadership of the Communist Party and resolutely takes the socialist road has the opportunity to serve the people and has an infinitely bright future. But for those of us who come from the old society, in order to better serve socialism, we must constantly carry out socialist self-transformation. The more transformation we do, the more we can contribute to socialism. Our Civil Revolutionary organizations at all levels and all comrades, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have carried out the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, and the political outlook and organizational outlook have undergone tremendous changes. However, whether in terms of our organization or the majority of members, the fundamental transformation has not yet been completed. The idea that it has been "transformed almost completely" or that it can be transformed quickly is obviously not in line with objective reality. Through the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, on the one hand, we realize that transformation is entirely possible, greatly increasing our confidence in self-transformation. At the same time, we also realize that transformation is a long-term, arduous, and even repetitive process. I am willing to follow the spirit of learning until old age, actively respond to Premier Zhou's call, and continue to work hard under the party's kind care and help, and gradually realize self-transformation in future long-term work practice.

Fellow delegates, I firmly believe that the 1959 plan will be overfulfilled; I firmly believe that we will be able to smash all the obstructions and sabotage of U.S. imperialism, liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, and realize the complete unification of our motherland. As Chairman Mao often taught us, our cause is just, and the just cause will surely win. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country will surely create more miracles in 1959, realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, and write a more magnificent and beautiful epic. Let us sing in unison the praises of the Communist Party, the praises of Chairman Mao, and the praises of socialism. No force in the world can stop us from advancing victoriously and joyfully!

### 不准扩张主义分子干涉我国内政  熊克武代表的发言

    不准扩张主义分子干涉我国内政
    熊克武代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我衷心拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，完全同意李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”，彭真副委员长的“第一届全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告”。并保证要在争取完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的斗争中，克尽自己的职责，贡献自己的力量。
    周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，正如人民日报所指出的，是“总结大跃进的史诗，鼓舞再跃进的号角”全面地、生动地刻划了我们伟大祖国日新月异的面貌，集中地反映了我们全国人民无比宏大的愿望。在听了李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告以后，对于我国一九五九年发展国民经济计划有了更具体的认识，这是一个更大、更好、更全面跃进的计划，是把鼓足干劲和科学分析结合起来的一个典范。我坚决相信，在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，通过全国人民的一致努力，一九五九年计划一定能够如期和超额完成，我们的正义事业在一九五九年一定将取得新的更大的胜利！
    一九五九年的大跃进真是史无前例的。我这次参加了在北京的视察工作，虽然自己终年住在北京，也有“曾几何时，江山不可复识”的感觉。关于视察的内容，我已另有报告，这里就不列举事实了。最使我感动的是劳动人民那种冲天的干劲和敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。他们在建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，为了迅速改变祖国和家乡的落后面貌，为了自己和子孙万代的幸福，进行着忘我的、创造性的劳动，使我们祖国经历着一天等于二十年的变化。这就使我更加深刻地认识了共产党的光荣、伟大和正确与社会主义制度的优越性；认识了新兴的人民公社具有多么伟大生命力；认识了劳动人民的革命积极性是怎样一浪高似一浪，他们的智慧和力量又是怎样无穷无尽。像我这样七十多岁的人，回想过去几十年在黑暗中摸索道路的苦难日子，面对着祖国今天这样日新月异、欣欣向荣的大好局面，内心的振奋和对共产党、毛主席的爱戴，都不是语言所能表达的。我愈热爱我们的祖国和共产党，也就愈加仇视、鄙视和蔑视帝国主义和一切反动派。他们千方百计地妄想破坏我们的正义事业，在无法否认我们大跃进的事实的时候，又对我们的大跃进进行种种的歪曲和诬蔑。俗语说的好：“狗嘴里是长不出象牙来的”，帝国主义者的造谣生事，都只是说明他们的黔驴技穷，说明他们的无知和对我们事业的无限恐惧。让帝国主义在我们大跃进的面前发抖吧，无论它们怎样叫嚣和挣扎，都阻止不了我们一天天好起来。同样地，也挽救不了它们一天天烂下去！
    第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议以来，特别是经过了全民整风运动和反对资产阶级右派的斗争，我国各族人民的团结是空前加强了。这个团结是以共产党领导为核心，以社会主义为基础，因而是坚如磐石、不可动摇的，这个团结所产生的力量是无坚不摧、无往不胜的。谁要企图破坏这个团结，谁就会立即被看作是全国人民的公敌，在各民族中完全陷于孤立；无论是国内或国外的敌人，如果无视这个团结的力量，就一定会在这个团结的力量面前碰得头破血流。最近，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团违反西藏广大人民的意愿，发动背叛祖国、破坏统一的武装叛乱，他们的可耻下场就是最有力的证明。我生长于邻近西藏的四川，深知藏族同胞在农奴制度下所受到的残酷剥削和痛苦，他们要求实行社会改革，摆脱农奴制的枷锁，这种愿望是完全可以理解，我们是应该全力加以赞助和支持的。周恩来总理在报告中希望一切好心的朋友们，如果真正同情西藏人民，就应该同情受旧制度压迫的绝大多数的西藏劳动人民，这是我们全国人民首先是西藏人民的一个善良的愿望，只有这样的同情才是真正的同情，也只有这样的同情者才是我们真正的朋友。伟大的中国人民绝对不能容忍任何扩张主义者披着同情西藏人民的外衣，来干涉我国的内政、危害西藏人民的根本利益，西藏反动集团叛乱的被彻底粉碎，揭开了西藏历史新的一页，历史前进的车轮是挽不回也挡不住的。
    第二届全国人民代表大会的代表包括了比过去更为广泛的各方面的代表人士，这就有力证明以共产党为领导的人民民主统一战线是更加巩固和发展了。共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，是至大至公的，一切政策和措施都是从六亿人民的利益出发，从来都是坚决团结一切可以团结的力量，而目的就是要尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。所以任何人，只要真诚接受共产党的领导，坚决走社会主义的道路，都有为人民效力的机会，也都有无限光明的前途。但是对于我们从旧社会过来的人说，要能够更好的为社会主义服务，就必须不断地进行社会主义的自我改造，多一分改造，也就能为社会主义多做出一分贡献。我们民革各级组织和全体同志，在共产党的领导下，进行了反右派斗争和整风运动，政治面貌和组织面貌都发生了巨大的变化，但是无论就我们的组织和多数成员来说，根本改造都还没有完成，那种认为已经“改造得差不多了”或者认为很快地就可以改造好的说法，显然都是不符合客观实际的。通过反右派斗争和整风运动，我们一方面认识到改造是完全可能的，大大地提高自我改造的信心，同时也认识改造是长期的、艰巨的、甚至会有反复的。我愿意本着活到老、学到老的精神，积极响应周总理的号召，在党的亲切关怀和帮助下，继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造。
    各位代表，我坚决相信一九五九年计划一定能够超额完成；坚决相信我们一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的一切阻挠和破坏，解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖，实现我们祖国的完全统一。正如毛主席常常教导我们的，我们的事业是正义的，正义的事业一定胜利。全国人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下，一定会在一九五九年创造出更多的奇迹，实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进，写出一部更加壮丽、美妙的史诗。让我们同声歌颂共产党、歌颂毛主席、歌颂社会主义，世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡我们欢乐地胜利前进！
