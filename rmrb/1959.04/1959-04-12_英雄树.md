　　Hero Tree
　　Guang Weiran
    Delighted to see kapok trees in Guangzhou. Green leaves have not yet sprouted, but red flowers bloom first, standing tall and independent among the lush greenery, raising their canopies to welcome the scorching sun. I heard Comrade Han Beiping say that the tree was named by a poet. During the Great Revolution, Comrade Guo Moruo, seeing the extraordinary character of the kapok, named it the Hero Tree. Now it is commonly known by that name. Lingering under the tree, I am pleased and compose this poem. The last couplets of both poems are unconventional, a result of carelessness.
    Poem One
    A tree of red flowers burns like fire, myriad stars pressing against the treetops.
    Lofty iron arms raised high in the sky, vigorous heroic posture standing tall on the ground.
    Ashamed to compete with peonies for beauty, daring to contend with rainbow maidens in allure.
    Loving the scorching sun in the morning, cherishing the moon in the evening, pushing aside clouds and parting the mist, heads held high.
        (Note) The ancients compared rainbows to beautiful women, calling them rainbow maidens.
    Poem Two (using the previous rhyme)
    Unwavering loyalty burns like fire, determined to stain the treetops with hot blood.
    In the past, branches and trunk endured frost for a long time, today clouds and rosy skies spread wide before the eyes:
    Scenery and seasons change in many ways, where in the rivers and mountains is there no charm?
    Green seas surging, red flags dancing, ten thousand heads surging, facing the sky, heads held high.

　　英雄树
　　光未然
    在广州喜见木棉树。绿叶未吐，红花先开，昂首特立于万绿丛中，张华盖以迎骄阳。听韩北屏同志说，树因诗人而得名。大革命时，郭沫若同志见木棉品格不凡，因题名为英雄树。今已叫惯了。树下徘徊，喜而赋此。两首末联破格处，是漫不经心之过。
    其一
    红花一树带火烧，星光万点压林梢。
    昂昂铁臂凌空举，勃勃英姿立地高。
    羞与牡丹争色相，敢同虹女斗妖娆。
    朝恋骄阳夕恋月，排云拨雾把头翘。
        （注）古人把彩虹比做美女，称为虹女。
    其二（用前韵）
    耿耿忠心似火烧，拼将热血染林梢。
    当年枝干经霜久，此日云霞放眼高：
    风物四时多变化，江山何处不妖娆？
    绿海翻腾红旗舞，万头攒动向天翘。
