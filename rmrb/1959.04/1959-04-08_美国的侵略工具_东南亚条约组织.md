    The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) is an aggressive military bloc cobbled together under the instigation and activity of the United States. Like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Baghdad Pact, it is completely controlled by the United States and serves American war policies. Strangely, of the eight member states of this organization named after Southeast Asia, only the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan are in Asia, and their populations account for only one-fifth of the total population of Southeast Asia. The remaining five countries, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, are all non-Asian countries.

    Originally, after World War II, American imperialism actively engaged in piecing together military alliances in Asia and the Pacific region to achieve its aim of aggression in this region. But it suffered a series of failures. In the end, it had to use the so-called "ANZUS Security Treaty" of the three member states as the foundation, and pull in the United Kingdom and France, as well as the three Asian countries of Thailand, the Philippines, and Pakistan, to form this group. In September 1954, the foreign ministers of these eight countries met in Manila and concluded the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," establishing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Because the meeting was held in Manila, it is also called the "Manila Treaty Organization."

    The headquarters of this organization is located in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. Its highest body is the Council, composed of the foreign ministers of the member states or representatives designated by the governments. Each government also designates a military officer as a military advisor to the representative. The Council has a Permanent Council, composed of representatives appointed by the member states and stationed in Bangkok. The Permanent Council has military, economic, "anti-subversion," and information committees, and each committee has many specialized subcommittees. The Council meets at least once a year. Since its establishment, it has held four Council meetings in Bangkok, Karachi, Canberra, and Manila in February 1955, March 1956, March 1957, and March 1958, respectively. The fifth meeting is being held in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, starting April 8 this year.

    Since its establishment, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has been a tool for the United States to pursue its policies of arms expansion and war preparation and colonial aggression in Southeast Asia. Under the guise of so-called "common defense" and "opposition to communist subversion," the United States has used this aggressive bloc not only to place the three Asian member states under its control, but also to constantly interfere in and subvert Southeast Asian countries, creating tension in Asia.

    At the beginning of its establishment, the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc crudely violated the provisions of the newly signed Geneva Accords on the restoration of peace in Indochina, and arbitrarily designated South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia as its "protected areas." In recent years, the United States has torn up the Geneva Accords step by step, plotting various conspiracies and tricks in an attempt to drag South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into this aggressive bloc. In order to force Cambodia to abandon its policy of peace, neutrality, and national independence, the United States instigated Thai and South Vietnamese troops to constantly carry out provocations against Cambodia and create border incidents last year. At the same time, the United States also provided funds and weapons to Cambodian rebels hiding in Thailand and South Vietnam, as well as within Cambodia, to carry out subversive activities in Cambodia. For several years, the rebellion in Indonesia has been actively supported by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The United States not only provided Indonesian rebels with a large number of weapons through this organization and sent "commanders" to directly help train the rebels, but also instructed Indonesian national scum to conspire to assassinate Sukarno, in order to achieve its shameful goal of subverting the Republic of Indonesia.

    The Asian member states Thailand, the Philippines, and Pakistan, which participate in this aggressive bloc, are increasingly trapped in turbulent and difficult situations because of their submission to the reactionary policies of the United States. Due to the establishment of more military bases and being more tightly bound to the American chariot, these countries have lost their control and security in the military and are in danger of being dragged into aggressive wars at any time. Due to following the US policy of arms expansion and war preparation, these countries have had to use 60%-70% of their national budgets for military expenditures, leaving these countries impoverished.

### 美国的侵略工具——东南亚条约组织

    美国的侵略工具——东南亚条约组织
    东南亚条约组织是在美国发起和活动下拼凑起来的一个侵略性军事集团。它同北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约组织等侵略集团一样，完全受美国的控制，为美国战争政策服务。奇怪的是，这个以东南亚为名的组织，它的八个成员国中，只有菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦三个国家在亚洲，它们的人口只占东南亚总人口的五分之一。其余五个国家，美国、法国、英国、澳大利亚和新西兰都是非亚洲国家。
    原来二次大战以后，美帝国主义在亚洲和太平洋地区积极从事拼凑军事联盟的活动，以实现它对这个地区进行侵略的目的。但是遭到了一系列的失败。最后只好以所谓“美澳新三国安全公约”的三个成员国为班底，拉上英国和法国以及泰国、菲律宾和巴基斯坦三个亚洲国家，凑成了这个集团。1954年9月，这八个国家的外交部长在马尼拉集会，缔结了所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”，建成东南亚条约组织。由于会议是在马尼拉召开的，所以又叫做“马尼拉条约组织”。
    这个组织的总部设在泰国首都曼谷。它的最高机构是理事会，由成员国外交部长或政府指定的代表组成，各国政府另指定一名军事人员作为代表的军事顾问。理事会下设常任理事会，由成员国任命常驻曼谷的代表组成。常任理事会下设军事、经济、“反颠复”和新闻等委员会，各委员会又设许多专门的小组委员会。理事会每年至少开会一次。从它成立以来，已经先后于1955年2月、1956年3月、1957年3月和1958年3月在曼谷、卡拉奇、堪培拉和马尼拉举行过四次理事会会议。今年4月8日起在新西兰首都惠灵顿举行的是第五次会议。
    东南亚条约组织自从成立以来，就是美国在东南亚推行扩军备战和殖民侵略政策的工具。美国利用这个侵略集团，在所谓“共同防御”和“反对共产主义颠复活动”的黑色幌子下，不仅把三个亚洲成员国放在它的控制之下，而且不断地对东南亚国家进行干涉和颠复活动，在亚洲制造紧张局势。
    东南亚侵略集团在它成立之初，就粗暴地违反刚刚签订的关于恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议的规定，擅自把南越、老挝、柬埔寨划为它的“保护地区”。几年来，美国一步步撕毁日内瓦协议，策划各种阴谋诡计，企图把南越、老挝和柬埔寨拖入这个侵略集团。为了迫使柬埔寨放弃和平中立和民族独立政策，美国在去年策动泰国和南越军队不断向柬埔寨进行挑衅，制造边境事件。同时，美国还供给窝藏在泰国和南越的以及在柬埔寨国内的柬埔寨叛乱分子经费和武器，在柬埔寨进行颠复活动。几年以来，印度尼西亚的叛乱活动一直得到东南亚条约组织的积极支持。美国不仅通过这个组织给予印度尼西亚叛乱分子大量武器和派遣“指挥员”直接帮助训练叛军，而且还指使印度尼西亚的民族败类阴谋暗杀苏加诺，来达到它颠复印度尼西亚共和国的可耻目的。
    参加这个侵略集团的亚洲成员国泰国、菲律宾和巴基斯坦，都因屈从美国的反动政策而日益陷于动荡不安和困难重重的境地。由于更多的军事基地的建立，更紧地被缚到美国的战车上，这些国家在军事上丧失了自己的控制权和安全地位，随时有被拖入侵略战争的危险。由于追随美国扩军备战的政策，这些国家不得不以60％—70％的国家预算用于军费开支，弄得这些国家民穷财尽。
