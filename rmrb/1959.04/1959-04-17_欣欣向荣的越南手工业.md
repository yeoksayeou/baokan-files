　　Thriving Vietnamese Handicraft Industry
　　Handicrafts are beautiful and durable
　　Production soars and sells well at home and abroad
　　The handicraft industry in North Vietnam is working day and night to produce "more, more beautiful, and more durable" handicrafts to meet the growing needs of domestic and foreign markets.

　　Last year, more than half of the goods sold in the domestic consumer goods market were handicrafts. The foreign exchange earned from exporting handicrafts, in addition to being used to purchase foreign goods, could also be used to build twenty medium-sized light industrial factories.

　　This year, the demand for handicrafts in the domestic market has increased significantly compared to last year. At the same time, exports of handicrafts have also increased by 5.3% compared to last year, accounting for 24.3% of total exports. Therefore, in the first quarter of this year, handicraft workers in North Vietnam have been busier than last year. They have used many old equipment and old factories to establish rows of new workshops. In Hanoi, Haiphong, and other places, many of the former colonialists' bars and dance halls have now become handicraft production sites. A large number of housewives in the cities have also joined the ranks of handicraft producers.

　　The vast majority of employees are enthusiastic
　　The cooperativization movement is developing rapidly
　　In order to realize the slogan of "producing more, more beautiful, and more durable handicrafts," the Vietnamese handicraft management department first promoted the development of the handicraft cooperativization movement. After studying the Labor Party's policy on the socialist transformation of handicrafts at the beginning of this year, handicraft workers have gradually improved their socialist consciousness and have requested to join cooperatives. At present, more than 40% of the handicraft population has joined various handicraft cooperative organizations, establishing more than 800 production teams and cooperatives. In addition, eight new state-owned handicraft factories have been established. The handicraft management department has also raised the standards for product acquisition and organized product appraisals to achieve "three major improvements" in the color, quality, and output of handicraft products.

　　Long history, striving for excellence
　　International reputation further enhanced
　　In the past two years, Vietnamese exquisite clothing, leather shoes, woolen sweaters, bamboo and rattan woven products, straw mats, shell buttons, and other handicrafts have been well received at previous international expositions. This year, due to continuous improvements in quality, its international reputation will be further enhanced. Vietnamese handicrafts have a long history, but during the years of French colonial rule, they suffered a heavy blow. A large number of handicraft workers were forced to abandon their ancestral crafts and were left to roam the streets. Some traditional industries such as silver filigree, lacquer polishing, embroidery, and ivory carving were forced to close down. After the restoration of peace in 1954, with the strong support of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, handicraft production was revived and achieved unprecedented development.

### 欣欣向荣的越南手工业

　　欣欣向荣的越南手工业
    手工业品美观耐用
    产量激增畅销内外
    越南北方的手工业正在日夜不停地生产出“更多、更美观耐用”的手工业品，以满足国内外市场日益增长的需要。
    去年，国内日用品市场销售的货物，有一半以上是手工业品。手工业品出口所换取的外汇，除用于购买外国物资以外，余款还可以建设二十个中型的轻工业工厂。
    今年，国内市场对手工业品的需要量，比去年大大增加。同时，手工业品的出口，也比去年增加5.3％，占出口总额的24.3％。因此，今年第一季度，越南北方的手工业者比去年显得更加忙碌。他们利用许多旧设备、旧厂房建立了一排排新的作坊。在河内、海防等地，过去殖民者的许多酒吧和舞厅，现在变成了手工业生产的场地。城市里的家庭妇女，也大量走进手工业生产者的行列。
    广大职工热情高涨
    合作化运动发展快
    为了实现“生产更多、更美观耐用的手工业品”的口号，越南手工业管理部门首先促进手工业合作化运动的发展。手工业者在今年初学习了劳动党关于手工业社会主义改造的政策之后，社会主义觉悟逐渐提高，纷纷要求加入合作社。目前，已经有占手工业人口40％以上的手工业工人加入了各种手工业合作组织，共成立了八百多个生产小组和合作社。另外，还新成立了八个国营手工业工场。手工业管理部门还提高产品收购的规格，组织产品评比，使手工业产品达到货色、质量和产量“三大提高”。
    历史悠久精益求精
    国际声誉更加提高
    近两年来，越南精美的服装、皮鞋、绒线衣、竹藤编织品、草席、贝壳钮扣等手工业品在历届国际博览会上获得好评。今年，由于不断改进质量，它的国际声誉将会更加提高。越南手工业有着悠久的历史，但是在法国殖民者统治的年代里，却遭到沉重的打击。大量手工业劳动者被迫抛弃祖传手艺，留落街头。一些传统的行业如镂银、磨漆、刺绣、象牙雕刻等被迫停业。到了1954年和平恢复后，在越南民主共和国政府的大力扶助下，手工业生产才恢复了生机，而且获得了史无前例的发展。
