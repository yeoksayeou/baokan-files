Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: In the nationwide railway workers' All-Around Great Leap Forward Red Flag Competition, successive victories have been achieved. In the fourteen days since the March 30th wired broadcast rally, the average daily car loading reached 35,700, an increase of 1,568 compared to early March. Freight car turnaround time also decreased from 2.46 days in March to 2.42 days.

Many railway bureaus also set new records. The Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot completed 110% of its daily car-kilometers on April 1st and 2nd, 125% of its daily locomotive production, and 104% of its technical speed, thereby earning the title of Red Flag Locomotive Depot. On the day of the broadcast rally, the Shanghai Railway Bureau completed 111.5% of its planned freight tonnage and achieved a net load of 44.9 tons, the best performance since March. From April 1st to 5th, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau exceeded its daily axle load by over 15,000 tons. Suzhou Station workers recently created a local-style gantry crane that increased the efficiency of unloading heavy goods by more than twenty times. The Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot lathe group proposed to gain efficiency from time and launched a 600-minute competition (i.e., each person does 600 minutes of work in eight hours per day). On April 4th, the average reached 1,130 minutes per person, with Zhao Ziying reaching 2,800 minutes.

In the competition, all railway bureaus have further strengthened internal and external cooperation between railways and mines, shortened vehicle dwell time, and accelerated vehicle turnaround. Qinhuangdao Station and the Port Authority have achieved close cooperation, with the station handling car loading and the Port Authority handling car unloading, reducing vehicle dwell time from 7.4 hours to 6 hours.

In order to further deepen the competition and ensure the quality of work, many railway bureau party committee leaders have formed working groups to go deep into grassroots units and directly contact workers, while also focusing on safety inspections.

　　铁路职工全面跃进红旗竞赛连战连捷
　　全国每天装车达三万五千多辆
    据新华社15日讯　全国铁路职工在全面跃进红旗竞赛运动中连战连捷，3月30日有线广播大会以后的十四天中平均每天装车数达到三万五千七百多车，比3月上旬增加一千五百六十八车；货车周转时间，也从3月的二点四六天缩短到二点四二天。
    许多路局职工还创造了新纪录。张家口机务段一、二日日车公里完成110％，机车日产量完成125％，技术速度完成104％，从而获得了红旗机务段的称号。上海路局在广播大会的当天，全局货物发运吨数完成计划的111.5％，净载重达到四十四点九吨，创造了3月份以来最好的成绩。郑州铁路局4月1日到5日，每天超轴一万五千吨以上。苏州站职工在最近还创造了一个土龙门吊机，把卸笨重货物的效率提高了二十多倍。石家庄机务段旋床组提出向时间要效率，开展了六百分钟竞赛（即每人每天在八小时内做六百分钟的工作），在4月4日平均每人达到一千一百三十分钟，其中赵子英达到了二千八百分钟。
    各路局在竞赛运动中都进一步加强了路矿内外的协作，缩短了车辆的停留时间，加速了车辆的周转。秦皇岛站和港务局取得密切配合，车站包装车，港务局包卸车，使车辆停站时间由七点四小时缩短到六小时。
    为了使竞赛运动更深入一步，保证工作质量，不少路局党委领导干部还组成工作组，深入基层单位与职工群众直接接触，同时大抓安全检查。
