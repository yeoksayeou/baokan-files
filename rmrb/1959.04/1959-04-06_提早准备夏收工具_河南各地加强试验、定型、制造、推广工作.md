Preparing for the Summer Harvest Early
Various Regions in Henan Strengthen Testing, Finalization, Manufacturing, and Promotion Efforts

(Our Dispatch) As the wheat in the vast areas of Henan Province is jointing, an interesting performance was held on a piece of open ground next to Jinshui Road in Zhengzhou in late March: people watched the various harvesting tools created from all over the province compete against each other in a dense wheat clump made of wheat stalks covering an area of two-tenths to three-tenths of an acre. Scythes, wheat sickles, and various human-pushed and horse-drawn harvesting tools quickly flattened clumps of wheat stalks like a skilled tailor's scissors. Feng Mingquan, a technician from the Nanyang City Bayi Metallurgical Manufacturing Plant, brought the Leap Forward-style human-pushed harvester he created to participate in the performance. With a few swishing sounds, a large area of wheat stalks fell neatly, earning cheers from the crowd. Many elderly people from the suburbs praised it highly. Someone said: This year, we don't have to worry about the wheat growing too densely, nor do we have to worry about not being able to harvest it all. This performance was organized by the Henan Provincial People's Committee Agricultural Department's Summer Harvest Tool Selection and Finalization Symposium. Through this on-site performance, the plan is to select several better harvesting tools to promote throughout the province.

Participating in this symposium were tool reform cadres and local agricultural tool manufacturing experts from various regions and more than forty counties and cities, bringing a total of fifty-one harvesting and threshing tools. Among them, the Leap Forward-style human-pushed harvester manufactured by Feng Mingquan, a technician from the Nanyang City Bayi Metallurgical Manufacturing Plant, was the most popular. The advantages of this harvester are that it is simple to manufacture, easy to operate, and highly efficient. Two people can harvest more than thirty acres a day. Some of the improved tools in other regions are also widely welcomed, such as the combined sickle improved by the Kaifeng region and the auger-type Leap Forward wheat shovel from Luyi County, both of which are planned to be promoted throughout the province. The auger-type Leap Forward wheat shovel can harvest fourteen to eighteen acres of wheat a day, more than doubling the original efficiency. The Kaifeng region plans to promote 1.5 million of these wheat shovels.

In the current wave of agricultural tool reform, various regions in Henan Province, due to early action and a strong focus on the manufacture of summer harvest agricultural tools, many regions are currently seeing a high tide in the preparation of wheat harvesting and threshing tools. According to incomplete statistics from the three regions of Nanyang, Xuchang, and Xinxiang, 177 different types of wheat harvesting tool samples have been manufactured. Each county in the Xuchang region has established a specialized organization to lead the manufacture of summer harvest tools, and specialized research groups have been established from the county to the township level. Shangshui, Changge, Yancheng, Wuyang, and other eight counties have drawn more than 8,000 workers to establish 238 harvesting and threshing tool research stations. The whole area has successfully tested more than 100 pieces of equipment including horse-drawn harvesters, hand-cranked harvesters, and harvesters modified from double-wheeled double-shared plows. Each county in the Kaifeng region, by calculating labor needs, has launched a high tide in the manufacture of summer harvest tools throughout the region. According to statistics from various counties, there is generally a labor shortage of 40%-50% during the wheat harvest season. In order to ensure a bumper wheat harvest and bring every grain home, many regions have put forward the slogan: "Get labor from tools." According to incomplete statistics for the whole area, more than 90,000 pieces of various harvesting and threshing tools have been modified. While vigorously developing various harvesters, they are also preparing to further improve 2.21 million wheat shovels, scythes, and wheat sickles, planning to harvest the wheat in the entire region in five days, ensuring a fast and clean harvest.

    提早准备夏收工具
    河南各地加强试验、定型、制造、推广工作
    本报讯　正当河南省广大地区小麦拔节的时候，3月下旬的一天，紧靠郑州市金水路旁边的一块空地上，进行着一个有趣的表演：人们在用麦秆插成二、三分地大的一块茂密的麦丛里，观看全省各地创造的各式各样收割工具竞比高低。钐刀、麦镰、人推马拉的各种收割工具，一个个像巧裁缝的剪刀一样，飞快的把一丛丛麦秆铲平。南阳市八一冶金制造厂技术工人冯明泉带着他创造的跃进式人推收割机来参加表演，只听见嚓嚓几声，麦秆就整整齐齐倒了一大片，博得了人们的喝彩，许多从郊区进城的老大爷赞不绝口。有人说：今年麦子不怕长得再稠，也不愁收不到家了。这个表演会是由河南省人民委员会农业厅召开的夏收工具选样定型座谈会所举办的。通过这次实地表演，准备评选出几种较好的收割工具，在全省推广。
    参加这个座谈会的有各个专区和四十多个县市的工具改革干部和农具制造土专家，他们带来了各种收割、脱粒工具共五十一件。其中南阳市八一冶金制造厂技术工人冯明泉制造的跃进式人推收割机最受欢迎。这种收割机的优点是制造简单，操作方便，效率高，二人操作，一天能收割三十多亩。有些地区的改良工具，也受到普遍的欢迎，如开封专区改良的合镰、鹿邑县的钻头式跃进麦铲，都准备在全省推广。钻头式跃进麦铲一天能收割十四至十八亩小麦，比原来工效提高二倍多，开封专区准备推广这种麦铲一百五十万把。
    河南省各个地区在当前农具改革的浪潮中，由于及早动手，大抓夏收农具的制造，目前不少地区小麦收割、脱粒工具的准备已经趋向高潮。据南阳、许昌、新乡三个专区的不完全统计，已经制造出各种小麦收割工具样品一百七十七部。许昌专区各县都建立了专门的机构来领导夏收工具的制造，从县到乡都成立了专门的研究小组。商水、长葛、郾城、舞阳等八个县，已抽出八千多工人，成立了二百三十八个收打工具研究站，全区已试验成功的有马拉收割机、手摇收割机和用双轮双铧犁改装的收割机一百多件。开封专区各个县通过算劳力账，在全区掀起夏收工具制造的高潮。据各个县统计，麦收时期，一般都缺劳力40％——50％，为了保证小麦丰收，粒粒还家，不少地区都提出：向工具要劳力的口号。全区不完全统计，已改制各种收割工具和脱粒工具九万多件，在大搞各式收割机的同时，还准备再改良麦铲、钐刀、麦镰二百二十一万件，计划把全专区小麦五天收割到家，保证收得快、收得净。
