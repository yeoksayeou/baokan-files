Chairman, fellow representatives, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and firmly support the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. After listening to the reports, I felt full of energy. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward in 1958 achieved unprecedented success. There is no doubt that in 1959, we will continue to make a Great Leap Forward on this basis, turning this year's magnificent blueprint into a splendid and glorious reality.

Like my fellow brothers and sisters of all ethnic groups present here, I feel boundless excitement and elation at the rapid suppression of the armed rebellion by a small handful of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet. This is a great victory for our country's policy of ethnic unity, and a great victory for the early realization of prosperity and happiness for the Tibetan compatriots. The indignant speeches of representatives Bainqen Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincain and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme the day before yesterday thoroughly exposed the process by which a small number of upper-class reactionary groups in Tibet kidnapped the Dalai Lama and launched an armed rebellion, allowing us to further recognize the true face of imperialism, foreign reactionaries, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan, and the Tibetan rebels as enemies of the broad masses of patriotic people in Tibet and the people of all of China. This has aroused the common hatred of the people of all ethnic groups in our country towards imperialism and reactionaries, and further strengthened the unbreakable unity of the Tibetan people with the people of all ethnic groups in the big family of the People's Republic of China. The calculations of imperialism and reactionaries are completely wrong. They are closing their eyes and failing to see the fundamental changes in the situation. The era when imperialism could arbitrarily manipulate China's internal affairs has long gone and will never return.

Imperialism and reactionaries always do bad things. But in a situation where the East wind is increasingly prevailing over the West wind, the more bad things they do, the more they move towards the opposite of their desires. The shameful failure of the rebellion by the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet under the instigation of imperialism, foreign reactionaries, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan has instead prompted the broad masses of Tibetan people to get rid of the stumbling blocks hindering democratic reform at an early date, and accelerated the progress, prosperity, and rebirth of the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Isn't this another vivid proof?

Tibet is Chinese territory, and the suppression of the rebellion by the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet is entirely China's internal affair, and no one is allowed to interfere. It is infuriating that after the Dalai Lama was kidnapped and entered India, certain "enthusiastic" officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs actually distributed absurd so-called "statements by the Dalai Lama" in Tezpur, which even Indian newspapers admitted were not made voluntarily by the Dalai Lama. At the same time, expansionist elements in India stirred up a clamor for "Tibetan independence" and even viciously slandered the Chinese government. China is putting down a rebellion by its own internal reactionary elements—what business is it of yours? Is the inglorious legacy of British imperialism, which has long been consigned to the history museum, still worth and possible to inherit? Premier Zhou Enlai said: "China and India have more than 2,000 years of friendly history, and are both countries that first advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. There is no reason for our two countries to shake the friendship between each other and the diplomatic principles jointly observed by the two countries because of a small handful of rebellious elements in Tibet." The divisive and sinful activities and crazy clamoring of Indian expansionist elements can only make imperialism happy and are not conducive to Sino-Indian friendship. As everyone knows, Sino-Indian friendship based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is a powerful factor in striving for peace in Asia and the world. For a long time, American imperialism has regarded Sino-Indian friendship as a thorn in its side, and has been trying every possible means to weaken Sino-Indian friendship and worsen relations between the two countries. The Indian "Free Press" is right in saying: "It would be a sad mistake if Indian public opinion were tempted and followed the West on this point." We Chinese have always adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and cherish Sino-Indian friendly relations. We believe that the people of China and India, who have suffered from the long-term harm of imperialism and have rich experience in fighting imperialism, will never allow the conspiracy of imperialism to undermine and slander. The fanning of flames and sowing discord by imperialism and all reactionaries may stir up a temporary counter-current, but in the end, they cannot escape the fate of a shameful failure. Now is the time for those hot-headed Indian expansionist elements to soberly assess the situation.

Next, I would like to talk about the self-remolding of old intellectuals and the future direction of efforts of the democratic parties. The Premier's report mentioned these two points. The Premier pointed out: A gratifying phenomenon has recently emerged in the work of self-remolding of old intellectuals, and many people have improved their ideological awareness to varying degrees. On the other hand, it is incorrect to think that old intellectuals no longer need to carry out self-remolding, or that they must complete thorough remolding in a very short period of time, otherwise they cannot do their work. The Premier also pointed out: The democratic parties have rectified their organizations in the rectification movement. They still play a positive role in the cause of uniting different social forces to serve socialism. In the future, in our country, it will still be necessary to continue to consolidate and develop the people's democratic united front on the basis that it serves socialism. Under the premise of acknowledging the leadership of the Communist Party, the long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties is still beneficial to the people's cause. These two sentences of the Premier are an encouragement and a spur to us old intellectuals and democratic party workers.

I fully agree with the Premier's realistic assessment of the self-remolding work of old intellectuals. Generally speaking, the achievements are not small. There are many people who were in a middle state politically in the past, but after a series of movements such as the rectification movement, the anti-rightist movement, and the exchange of hearts in recent years, their political ideology and work style have all shown a new look. Many people, driven by the situation of "getting on the horse of practice and going down to the sea of the masses," have made progress in their political stance, ideological style, and business practice. What is particularly valuable is that their consciousness of self-remolding and work has been enhanced. But on the other hand, there are still some problems. First, the transformation of old intellectuals in their political stance and the improvement in their ideological style are still unbalanced. Generally speaking, everyone got on the horse driven by the situation, but some were "whipping the horse faster," some were "taking their time," some had twists and turns, and some wanted to go but stopped. As for those who stood still or retreated, they should be said to be in the minority. The general situation can be said to be progress, but no matter what the situation, the achievements still need to be consolidated. Facts have proved what the Premier said in his report: "Of course, they still need a relatively long period of time to further and thoroughly break with the bourgeois world outlook and truly grasp the world outlook of the working class." The self-remolding of old intellectuals must go through a long and repeated process, which is a truth. Second, the self-remolding of old intellectuals should take the socialist work post as the base, so that the remolding and service are organically combined, which has proved to be an effective experience. But some intellectuals, after the rectification movement or after the criticism of bourgeois academic thought, have a feeling of "two major emptiness" (meaning that politics is not good, and business is not good either). Some say that they have realized "the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way out," but they have not yet reached the realm of "the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, and there is another village," so they cannot be active. In fact, this idea that "you must be thoroughly remolded before you can do work, otherwise it is impossible to work" is incorrect. As the Premier pointed out in his report, all old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-remolding in the long-term work practice in the future. Remolding and service are a dialectical unity, with more remolding, more service; with more service, more remolding. Third, opening up one's mind and saying everything one knows is an effective way for old intellectuals to carry out self-remolding. Because you may see yourself clearly or unclearly, sometimes, it is helpful to expose your thoughts as much as possible and get help from everyone, affirm what is right, and correct what is wrong. Over time, it will be of great benefit to remolding. But some comrades hold wrong ideas, and some are unwilling to expose their thoughts. In fact, it is themselves who suffer from this kind of thinking. As the saying goes, "A bone stuck in the throat, it's a pleasure to spit it out." If you don't spit out the bone stuck in your throat for years and months, how can you feel comfortable? Furthermore, if the wrong ideas in people's minds are discovered and helped at any time, and corrected at any time, then naturally, fewer mistakes will be made. Therefore, I think that advocating opening up one's mind is of great benefit to our self-remolding, but of course, this depends on consciousness.

The Premier's report reiterated the Party's policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the democratic parties. I believe that the democratic parties must faithfully implement the Party's policy and properly complete their historical tasks, that is, to earnestly act as one of the auxiliary forces for the Party to unite, educate, and remold bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, and help their members and the masses they contact to carry out fundamental remolding. The democratic parties are bourgeois political parties, which is still an objective fact today and must be acknowledged. But we must never be complacent, but should strive for the fundamental remolding of the democratic parties. To be more specific, due to the leadership of the Party, and due to the fact that the democratic parties have an active side that may accept socialist remolding, under the realistic historical conditions, it is possible to gradually transform the democratic parties from bourgeois political parties into political forces that truly serve socialism. In the past, our democratic parties have done some work, and in the future, we must further complete this glorious historical task.

The above are some superficial opinions, and I ask the representatives and committee members for their corrections.

### 我平息内部叛乱  与外人绝不相干  王绍鏊代表对印度扩张主义分子表示愤慨

专栏：

    我平息内部叛乱  与外人绝不相干
    王绍鏊代表对印度扩张主义分子表示愤慨主席，各位代表，各位委员：
    我完全同意和坚决拥护周恩来总理、李富春、李先念两位副总理、彭真副委员长和李维汉副主席的报告。我听了报告，感到浑身是劲。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，一九五八年全国大跃进取得了史无前例的成绩。毫无疑问，一九五九年我们还将在这个基础上继续大跃进，把今年宏伟的图景，变成瑰丽辉煌的现实。
    我同在座的各族兄弟姊妹一样，对于西藏一小撮上层反动分子武装叛乱的迅速平定，感到无比的兴奋和欢欣鼓舞。这是我国民族团结政策的一个伟大胜利，是西藏同胞早日走上繁荣幸福道路的一个伟大胜利。前天班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞和阿沛·阿旺晋美两位代表义愤填膺的发言，彻底揭露了西藏少数上层反动集团劫持达赖喇嘛、发动武装叛乱的经过，使我们进一步认识了帝国主义、外国反动派、台湾蒋匪帮和西藏叛乱分子同西藏广大爱国人民和全中国人民为敌的真面目，激起了我们全国各族人民对于帝国主义和反动派的同仇敌忾，更加加强了西藏人民同各族人民在中华人民共和国大家庭中牢不可破的团结。帝国主义和反动派的盘算完全错了。他们闭着眼睛不看看形势的根本变化。帝国主义可以任意摆布中国内政的时代早已一去不复返了。
    帝国主义和反动派总是尽做坏事。但在东风日益压倒西风的形势下，它们愈做坏事，就愈是走向它们愿望的反面。西藏上层反动集团在帝国主义、外国反动派和台湾蒋介石集团策动下的叛乱的可耻失败，反而促使西藏广大人民早日摆脱阻挠民主改革的绊脚石，加速西藏自治区的进步、繁荣和新生，难道不是又一个活生生的证明吗？
    西藏是中国的领土，平息西藏上层反动集团的叛乱完全是中国的内政，是绝对不容许任何人干涉的。令人愤慨的是，在达赖喇嘛被劫持进入印度以后，某些“热心”的印度外交部官员竟在提斯浦尔散发荒谬绝伦的、连印度报纸也承认非出于达赖喇嘛自愿的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，同时印度的扩张主义分子掀起了一阵什么“西藏独立”乃至于恶毒诬蔑中国政府的叫嚣。中国自己平定自己内部反动分子的叛乱，“干卿底事”，早已送入历史博物馆的英帝国主义这分不光采的遗产，难道还值得并可能加以继承么？周恩来总理说过：“中印两国有两千多年的友好历史，并且同是首倡和平共处五项原则的国家，我们两国都没有任何理由因为西藏的一小撮叛乱分子而动摇互相间的友谊和两国共同遵守的外交原则”。印度扩张主义分子的分裂中国的罪恶活动和疯狂叫嚣，显然只能使帝国主义高兴，而不利于中印的友好。大家知道，基于和平共处五项原则的中印友好是争取亚洲和世界和平的有力因素，长期以来，美帝国主义一直视中印友好为眼中钉，一直在千方百计地企图削弱中印友谊和使两国关系恶化。印度“自由新闻”说得对：“如果印度舆论在这一点上受到诱惑和追随西方的话，那将是可悲的错误”。我们中国一贯遵守和平共处的五项原则，珍重中印友好关系。我们相信，曾经身受帝国主义长期祸害、又曾有同帝国主义进行斗争的丰富经验的中印两国人民，是决不容许帝国主义破坏、中伤的阴谋得逞的。帝国主义和一切反动派的煽风点火，挑拨离间，尽管掀起一时的逆流：但最后不能不落得可耻失败的下场。现在应该是那些头脑发热的印度扩张主义分子清醒估计形势的时候了。
    其次，我想谈谈旧知识分子自我改造和民主党派今后努力方向的问题。总理报告中已提到这两点。总理指出：旧知识分子的自我改造工作，近来出现了一个可喜的现象，许多人在不同程度上提高了思想觉悟；在另一方面，以为旧知识分子已经不需要再进行自我改造，或者以为他们必须在很短的时间内完成彻底的改造，否则就不能做工作，都是不对的。总理又指出：各民主党派在整风中整顿了自己的组织；他们在团结不同的社会力量来为社会主义服务的事业中，仍然起积极的作用。今后在我国仍然需要在为社会主义服务的基础上继续巩固和发展人民民主统一战线。在承认共产党领导的前提下，共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督，对于人民事业仍然是有益的。总理这两句话，对我们旧知识分子和民主党派工作者是一个鼓舞，也是一种鞭策。
    我完全同意总理对于旧知识分子自我改造工作实事求是的估计。总的来说，成绩不小。
  有不少人政治上过去处于中间状态，但经过近年来整风、反右、交心等一系列的运动，他们的政治思想、工作作风都出现了新面貌。不少人在“上实践之马、下群众之海”的形势推动下，无论在政治立场、思想作风和业务实践上都有了进步，尤其可贵的是自我改造和工作的自觉性增强了。但另一方面，也还存在着一些问题。第一、旧知识分子在政治立场上的转变和思想作风上的改进还是不平衡的，一般说来，大家在形势推动下上了马，但有的“快马加鞭”，有的“慢条斯理”，有的三波四折，有的欲行又止，至于原地踏步和向后倒退的，则应该说是少数。总的情况可说是前进，但不管是那一种情况，成绩都还有待于巩固。事情证明了总理在报告中所说：“当然，他们要进一步彻底地同资产阶级的世界观决裂，真正掌握工人阶级的世界观，那还需要一个较长的时期”。旧知识分子的自我改造必须经过长期、反复的历程，是一条真理。第二、旧知识分子的自我改造，应该以社会主义工作岗位为基地，使改造同服务有机地结合起来，证明是行之有效的经验。但有些知识分子经过整风以后，或者经过资产阶级学术思想批判以后，有“两大皆空”的感觉（意即政治不行，业务也不行），有的则说已体会到“山穷水尽疑无路”，但尚没有“柳暗花明又一村”的境界，因而积极不起来。其实，这种以为“必须彻底改造好了才能做工作，否则就不可能工作”的想法是不对的。正如总理在报告中所指出，一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造。改造与服务本是辩证的统一，多一分改造，多一分服务；多一分服务，也就多一分改造。第三、敞开思想、知无不言，是旧知识分子进行自我改造的一条有效方法。因为自己看自己，有时看得清，有时也许看不清，把自己思想尽量暴露，通过大家来帮助，对的肯定，不对的纠正，久而久之，对于改造必有极大好处。但是有些同志抱着错误想法，一些不肯暴露自己的思想。这种想法，其实吃亏的还是自己。俗语说：“骨鲠在喉，一吐为快”，你成年累月把骨鲠在喉头里不吐出来，那会使自己心情舒畅呢？再则，如果人们头脑中的错误思想，随时发现，随时得到帮助，随时得到改正，这样自然而然地会少犯错误。所以，我以为提倡敞开思想，对于我们的自我改造大有好处，不过这当然要靠自觉。
    总理报告中重申党同各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针。我认为民主党派必须忠实地贯彻党的这个方针，好好地完成自己的历史任务，那就是，认真地作为党团结、教育、改造资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的辅助力量之一，帮助自己的成员和所联系的群众进行根本改造。民主党派是资产阶级性质的政党，这在今天还是客观的事实，必须承认。但我们决不应故步自封，而应该为争取民主党派根本改造而努力，具体些说，由于党的领导，由于民主党派存在着可能接受社会主义改造的这种积极性的一面，在现实的历史条件下，有可能把各民主党派从资产阶级性的政党，逐步改造成为真正为社会主义服务的政治力量。过去我们民主党派已经做了一些工作，今后更要进一步完成这个光荣的历史任务。
    以上一些肤浅的意见，请求代表委员们指正。
