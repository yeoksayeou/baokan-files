Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th. Vietnam News Agency reported yesterday that Pham Van Dong, Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent telegrams to the Prime Ministers of India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan, congratulating them on the fourth anniversary of the opening of the Bandung Conference. These five countries were the initiators of the 1955 Asian-African Conference.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said that the Bandung Conference marked an important step forward in strengthening Asian-African solidarity, opposing colonialism, and striving for peace, national independence, and international cooperation. For more than four years, the Bandung spirit has been developing continuously, and the Bandung principles have become the basic principles of international relations. He said that the closely united Asian and African people have defeated many wars and aggressive conspiracies of colonialists and imperialists.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is loyal to the Bandung resolutions and always stands in solidarity with other Asian and African people to fight against aggressive colonialism and promote cooperation between countries.

He expressed his firm belief that the friendly relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, Pakistan, and other Asian and African countries will be strengthened day by day.

Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 17th. S. Subasinghe, Chairman of the Ceylon Afro-Asian Solidarity Association, in a statement issued today to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, reminded people to pay attention to the fact that colonialists are trying their best to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian and African countries and sow seeds of discord between these countries. The statement said that the Asian and African people are watching with unease the imperialist countries' attempts to expand military treaties, permanently occupy foreign bases, and support reactionary groups in order to maintain imperialism's foothold in the region. The statement said that these conspiracies will surely fail, and the Asian and African people's march towards freedom, progress, peace, and friendship will surely be victorious.

The statement pointed out that since the Bandung Conference, the most significant change has been that the national liberation movements in the colonies are gathering strength and more countries in the region have achieved independence. The statement finally paid tribute to all those fighting for freedom and peace in Asia and Africa and pledged to support them.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th. "Democratic Korea" published an article today commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, saying: The Bandung Conference made a great contribution to the national liberation struggle of the Asian and African people against imperialism and colonialism. After the Bandung Conference, the national liberation struggle of the Asian and African people entered a climax.

The article said that the imperialists are currently struggling, trying to use Africa as their last stronghold. However, the reality clearly shows that the era in which they could do whatever they wanted in Africa is gone forever. The editorial pointed out that the time when the imperialists will be completely driven out of Asia and Africa is not far away.

The article said that the spirit of the Bandung Conference has also shown great vitality in strengthening and developing friendship and solidarity between Asian and African countries. The article said that last year, the strong solidarity of the Asian and African people shown in the struggle against the U.S. imperialism's adventurous provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait and the imperialists' armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan made the Western colonialists headed by U.S. imperialism tremble.

The article continued, saying that the spirit of the Bandung Conference has also made a great contribution to promoting the victory of the principle of peaceful coexistence worldwide.

The article said that the Asian and African people are increasingly firmly convinced that strengthening friendship and solidarity with the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union is a strong guarantee for their victory. The article said that the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union actively support and respect the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and strive for their implementation.

The article said that the Korean people believe that the spirit of the Bandung Conference is in line with their interests in opposing the U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression against Korea and striving for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and actively support it.

The article concluded by saying that in order to eliminate the U.S. war threat that still exists in the region and consolidate peace, it is necessary to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone of peace in the Asian region, dissolve aggressive military blocs such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, and establish a collective security system.

　　万隆精神显示了巨大的生命力
　　范文同致电印度等国总理祝贺万隆会议四周年
　　锡兰亚非团结协会主席指出万隆会议以来更多国家取得独立
    新华社河内18日电　越南通讯社昨天报道，越南民主共和国总理范文同打电报给印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰和巴基斯坦的总理，祝贺万隆会议开幕四周年。这五个国家是1955年亚非会议的倡议国。
    范文同总理说，万隆会议标志着在加强亚非团结，反对殖民主义，争取和平、民族独立和国际合作方面，向前迈进的一个重要步骤。四年多来，万隆精神在不断发展，万隆原则已经成为国际关系的基本原则。他说，紧密团结在一起的亚非人民已经击败了殖民主义者和帝国主义者的许多战争和侵略阴谋。
    范文同总理说，越南民主共和国政府忠于万隆决议，始终和其它亚非人民团结一致，为反对侵略成性的殖民主义和促进各国之间的合作而斗争。
    他表示坚信，越南民主共和国同印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、巴基斯坦以及其它亚非国家之间的友好关系将日益加强。
    新华社科伦坡17日电　锡兰亚非团结协会主席苏巴辛格在今天就纪念万隆会议四周年发表的声明中，提醒人们注意殖民主义者正在竭力干涉亚非国家的内政和在这些国家之间散布不和的种子。声明说，亚非人民怀着不安的心情注视着帝国主义国家企图扩大军事条约，永久占有外国基地和支持反动集团，以便保持帝国主义在这个地区的立足点。声明说，这些阴谋一定会遭到失败，亚非人民向自由、进步、和平和友谊的进军一定会取得胜利。
    声明指出，万隆会议以来，最重大的变化是殖民地的民族解放运动正在集聚力量和这个地区更多的国家取得了独立。声明最后向亚、非两大洲一切为自由和和平而斗争的人们致敬，并且保证支持他们。
    新华社平壤17日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表的一篇纪念万隆会议四周年的文章说：万隆会议对反对帝国主义和殖民主义的亚非人民的民族解放斗争作出了巨大贡献。万隆会议以后，亚非人民的民族解放斗争进入了高潮。
    文章说，帝国主义者目前正在进行挣扎，企图把非洲作为他们的最后据点。但是，现实情况清楚地表明，他们在非洲随心所欲的时代已经一去不复返了。社论指出，帝国主义者被完全赶出亚非两个大陆的时候已经为期不远。
    文章说，万隆会议的精神在加强和发展亚非国家之间的友谊团结方面也显示了巨大的生命力。文章说，去年，在反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡的冒险挑衅行动和帝国主义者对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略的斗争中所表现出来的亚非人民的坚强团结，使以美帝国主义为首的西方殖民主义者为之胆寒。
    文章继续说，万隆会议精神对在全世界范围内促进和平共处原则的胜利也作出巨大贡献。
    文章说，亚非人民日益坚决地相信，加强同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的友谊团结是他们获得胜利的坚强保证。文章说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家，积极支持和尊重万隆会议的决议，并且为其实现而进行努力。
    文章说，朝鲜人民认为万隆会议精神同他们反对美帝国主义的侵朝政策、争取和平统一祖国的斗争的利益是一致的，并且积极支持它。
    文章最后说，为了消除目前仍然存在的美国对这个地区的战争威胁和巩固和平，必须在亚洲地区建立无核武器的和平地区，解散东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约等侵略性军事集团，建立集体安全体系。
