Fellow Representatives:

I fully agree with the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai, and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward for the entire nation. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the people of the entire country achieved great victories in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and education, greatly enhancing our country's international prestige and strengthening the fraternal unity among all nationalities. The entire nation is rejoicing in these unprecedented and brilliant achievements. However, imperialists and domestic and foreign reactionaries are colluding in every possible way to carry out sabotage from all sides. The armed rebellion recently launched by the former local government of Tibet and the reactionary upper strata is a clear example. Their crimes of colluding with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to betray the motherland are attempts to split the motherland, restore the imperialist forces of aggression in Tibet, and preserve Tibet's backward, reactionary, and cruel serf system. The State Council's order to dissolve the local government of Tibet and thoroughly quell the rebellion has received enthusiastic support from the people of all nationalities throughout the country, and is particularly warmly welcomed by the broad patriotic monks, nuns, and people of Tibet. With their active support, the Tibet Military Region troops of the People's Liberation Army and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region have completely controlled the situation in Tibet, causing the conspiracies of the Tibetan upper-class reactionaries, imperialists, and foreign reactionaries to suffer a shameful defeat. The people of Tibet will be freed from the shackles of the serf system and realize their great aspirations for democratic autonomy and social progress. It is infuriating that imperialism is using the Tibetan rebellion to stir up trouble. The so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" disseminated through Indian diplomatic officials on April 18 is completely absurd and shameless fabrication. This act of interfering in our internal affairs is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The era when China was bullied is over. The conspiracies of imperialists and Indian expansionist elements are bound to suffer a shameful defeat.

The Speed of National Coal Production Development in 1958 Was Unprecedented

Now, I will report to the conference on the situation of technical innovation, technical revolution, and the large-scale bumper harvest red flag emulation campaign in the coal industry in 1958 and 1959.

In 1958, national coal production leaped from 130 million tons in 1957 to 270 million tons. This made our country jump from sixth place in the world in coal production in 1957 (United States, Soviet Union, West Germany, East Germany, United Kingdom, China) to third place (Soviet Union, United States, China), and left the United Kingdom far behind (the United Kingdom's actual production in 1958 was about 220 million tons). The increase in coal production in one year was more than twice the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan period, and 2.3 times the total coal increase in the old China from 1878, when the first modern mine was built, to 1942 (the highest annual output before liberation). It took only one year for China to increase coal production from 130 million tons to 270 million tons, while it took the United States 14 years and the United Kingdom 32 years. This speed of development is unprecedented.

Everyone Contributes Ideas and Suggestions, Launching a Mass Technical Innovation Movement

The characteristic of the coal industry is underground work, and the working conditions are relatively difficult, and it is threatened by natural disasters such as water, fire, gas, silicosis, and coal dust. Therefore, it is of particular importance to widely and deeply carry out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements, gradually subdue the threat of natural disasters, achieve safe production, improve labor productivity, and develop the coal industry at high speed. In 1958, all employees of the coal industry, after the rectification movement, carried forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and ingenuity, and launched a vigorous mass technical revolution movement with everyone contributing ideas and suggestions. In the movement, 36 major advanced experiences (12 related to production, 14 to basic construction, 4 to coal washing, and 6 to mechanical manufacturing) were created, summarized, and promoted. This is an important key to the coal industry's leap forward.

In the process of coal production, we tightly grasped the central link of increasing the output of the coal mining face (i.e., the basic production unit, the same below), and carried out reforms in all aspects of production organization and coal mining technology. This is an important factor in the rapid growth of coal production. In terms of production organization, in the past, coal mining faces generally adopted a work system of two shifts for production and one shift for preparation (each shift working eight hours). Last year, some mines changed to a "four (shifts) eight (hours)" cross-operation system, relatively increasing the working time by eight hours every day, that is, changing the 24 hours of each day to 32 hours of working time. Some mines changed to a mixed operation system of production and preparation, implementing three shifts for production, which doubled coal production. For example, the No. 4 Mine of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau adopted the "four, eight" cross-operation, and the average daily output of the working face increased from 350 tons to 750 tons, an increase of more than one time. One working face of Fengfeng No. 3 Mine implemented a three-shift production mixed operation, increasing the average daily output from 300 tons to 600 tons, an increase of one time. Some mines promoted the method of "one shot one cut" (in the past, only one method was used on a working face), that is, placing the scraper conveyor (chain plate conveyor, the same below) close to the coal wall, firing one shot, mining coal once, and then using a combine to mine coal once. In this way, the output of the working face can be increased by about one time. For example, after the Hengshan Mine of the Jixi Mining Bureau promoted this experience, the average daily output of the working face increased from 186 tons to 390 tons, an increase of more than one time.

In terms of coal mining technology, many mines have lengthened the cutting disc of the coal cutter, that is, lengthening the cutting disc of the coal cutter used for coal mining from 1.2 to 1.8 meters in the past to 2.2 to 3.2 meters. One working face of the Jiawang Xiaqiao Mine promoted this experience, increasing the average daily output from 400 tons to 732 tons, an increase of 83 percent. Quickly moving the scraper conveyor is also a major technical revolution. In the past, the method of moving the scraper conveyor on the working face was to dismantle the entire scraper conveyor and move it manually, which took four hours. Now, using the motor on the scraper conveyor or the hydraulic prop winch to move the scraper conveyor only takes one hour to one and a half hours, which greatly increases the coal mining time. Artificial coal loading on the coal mining face is the process that uses the most people and takes the longest time in coal mining, and it is extremely heavy physical labor. In 1958, many coal mines adopted the method of blasting coal loading, that is, placing the scraper conveyor close to the working face, and after drilling and blasting, the coal collapses onto the scraper conveyor, which can generally reduce the amount of artificial coal loading by about 50 percent.

The Appearance and Promotion of Hydraulic Mining Has Brought China's Coal Mining Industry Into a New Stage

While extensively innovating general technologies, great work has also been done on advanced technologies in the coal industry. The main focus was on experimenting with and promoting the advanced technology of hydraulic mining. In July last year, the first all-hydraulic mining mine was built in the Tangjiazhuang Mine of Kailuan. After several months of hard work and diligent research, the technical barriers in the hydraulic mining process, such as hydraulic coal cutting, hydraulic transportation (underground), hydraulic hoisting, and dewatering and drying, were basically overcome. In particular, the coal-water pump for hydraulic hoisting is the central key to hydraulic mining. Initially, due to the lack of experience in the design of the coal-water pump, the coal-water often invaded the ball bearings, causing damage every three or four days on average, and normal production was not possible. After the workers diligently researched, and absorbed the experience of the Jiawang Coal Mine, moving the bearings outside the pump housing and sealing them with high-pressure clean water, as well as improving the manufacturing quality of the coal-water pump, and strengthening maintenance and other series of measures, it was finally resolved. Normal operation has been going on for more than three months. Although hydraulic mining has only begun to be adopted in China, it has already shown its advantages. According to the comparison between hydraulic mining and general mechanized mining faces in Kailuan Coal Mine last year, the labor productivity of hydraulic mining is nearly three times higher than that of general mechanized mining, which can save 60 to 70 percent of the labor force, reduce timber consumption by 70 percent, and reduce costs by 50 percent. In particular, due to the promotion of hydraulic mining, coal dust has been completely eliminated, and roof fall accidents have been basically eliminated, which has been enthusiastically supported by the majority of workers and their families. They said: "Hydraulic mining is: heavy work becomes light work, labor becomes entertainment (opening water guns), black faces become white faces, and it is easier for miners to find wives." Hydraulic mining is the main technical direction for the future development of the coal industry. The emergence and promotion of hydraulic mining will bring China's coal mining industry into a new stage.

In order to successfully complete and overfulfill the coal industry's production and construction tasks in 1959, we have launched a large-scale bumper harvest red flag emulation campaign. This is the best way to fully utilize the infinite wisdom and high production enthusiasm of all employees, and further tap the production potential of existing enterprises. That is, in all business units, continue to deeply carry out mass technical revolution movements to increase the output of all coal mining faces and achieve the goal of large-scale bumper harvest.

The Large-Scale Bumper Harvest Red Flag Emulation Campaign Has Been Universally Launched in National Coal Mining Enterprises, and the Output of Coal Mining Faces Has Been Significantly Increased in a Short Month

In the Great Leap Forward last year, a considerable number of high-yield working faces emerged, and many advanced experiences were created. However, the output of advanced, general, and backward working faces varied greatly. Not only was there a big difference in the output of working faces with basically the same working conditions, but also some working faces with poor conditions had high output, while some working faces with good conditions had low output. For example, the average monthly output of thick coal seam working faces in national key coal mines was 7,735 tons, and the average monthly output of medium-thick coal seam working faces was 6,691 tons. However, the monthly output of 21 thick and medium-thick coal seam working faces (accounting for 2 percent of the total number of thick and medium-thick coal seam working faces) had reached 20,000 to 30,000 tons. One working face in Zone 1 of the Fushun Laohutai Mine had a monthly output of more than 30,000 tons. The average monthly output of thin coal seam working faces was 4,021 tons, and the monthly output of nine working faces (accounting for 2.2 percent of the total number of thin coal seam working faces) had reached more than 10,000 tons. The monthly output of the "No. 2 Well No. 6 Road" working face of the Jixi Didao Coal Mine had reached 18,000 tons. This is enough to show that the production potential of existing enterprises is very large. In order to widely and deeply mobilize the masses, make the backward become advanced, and the advanced become even more advanced, we have formulated a red flag emulation standard for large-scale bumper harvest and average advancement, requiring the average monthly output of thick and medium-thick coal seam working faces to reach 10,000 tons, and the average monthly output of thin coal seam working faces to reach 7,000 tons, as an advanced standard. There are currently 1,700 coal mining faces in national key coal mines. If 50 percent of them can reach this standard, the output of the working faces can be increased by about 25 percent compared to last year. This is a great potential, and the mass large-scale bumper harvest red flag emulation campaign is the key to unlocking this potential.

Since the National Coal Industry Cadre Conference at the end of February and the Red Flag Emulation Broadcast Conference in early March, a vigorous and magnificent large-scale bumper harvest red flag emulation campaign centered on high output and high quality has been universally launched in national coal mining enterprises. In this short month, it has fully demonstrated its power, and the output of coal mining faces has been significantly increased. According to the statistics of 1,408 coal mining faces in 28 key mining bureaus in the fourth quarter of last year, there were 150 that reached 10,000 tons of monthly output, including 33 that reached more than 20,000 tons. In March of this year, there were 360 that reached 10,000 tons of monthly output, including 72 that reached more than 20,000 tons. In particular, the average monthly output of all coal mining faces in Kailuan and Fushun coal mines in March reached more than 13,000 tons. The average monthly output of all working faces in 28 key mining bureaus in March reached 7,751 tons, an increase of 11 percent compared with the average monthly output of 6,908 tons in the fourth quarter of last year. This is the main reason why the national coal industry overfulfilled the first quarter production plan.

The large-scale bumper harvest red flag emulation is based on increasing the output of all coal mining faces, and is carried out with the goal of achieving an average monthly output of 10,000 tons for all coal mining faces in the mine, mining bureau, or province. Therefore, this promotes the care and assistance of leaders at all levels to general and backward units. Many bureau and mine directors and party secretaries go deep into the front lines and into the masses, adopt the method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, conduct ideological screening, working face screening, and weak link screening, find the key, and solve it. This changed the past practice of cultivating more typical examples and promoting them less widely, being satisfied with advanced examples, and neglecting to improve the general level, greatly encouraging the production enthusiasm of all employees. Some workers said: "In the past, leading cadres only cared about experimental fields, but this time the leadership cares about us," "In the past, the higher-ups only gave coal cars to advanced teams, but this time it's our team's turn to hold our heads high," "If cadres can go into the sea, we can capture the dragon." An atmosphere of "others can give way, but the red flag cannot be given away" and "who is a hero, who is a good man, we'll see at the end of the month's evaluation" has been created among the workers. Units that were backward in the past have leaped to the advanced level. For example, the No. 55 coal mining team of the Zibo Hongshan Mine, in a 0.85-meter thin coal seam working face, due to putting politics in command, adjusting the organization, and carrying out technical reforms, increased from 6,102 tons of monthly output in February to more than 13,000 tons in March, doubling the output, which was 1,746 tons more than the monthly output of the consistently advanced No. 52 team. Of the four thin coal seam coal mining faces in the No. 1 vertical shaft of the mine, only one had reached 10,000 tons of monthly output in the past. In March, due to strengthened leadership and mobilization of the masses, the average monthly output of these four working faces was all above 10,000 tons.

Inserting the red flag of large-scale bumper harvest is the collective honor of all employees of each business unit. In the red flag emulation campaign, the communist spirit of cooperation among the broad masses of workers has been greatly promoted, achieving the goal of mutual pursuit, mutual learning, mutual assistance, and common improvement. For example, the tunneling workers of the Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Mine launched the "five satisfaction" movement. That is, to ensure the quality of the project, so that the mining area is satisfied, the supervision department is satisfied; to complete the task early and hand it over to production, so that the leadership is satisfied; the roadway meets the specifications, so that the installation team is satisfied; the three shifts cooperate, do not leave difficulties, so that the three shifts of workers are satisfied. Correspondingly, they improved the blasting methods and operating techniques, so that the four coal mining faces of the Zhaogezhuang Mine were handed over to production 15 days ahead of schedule, ensuring the quality of the project, and truly achieved satisfaction for everyone.

On the coal industry front, the large-scale bumper harvest red flag emulation campaign is in full swing, but the development of the movement is not balanced enough. We should further strengthen leadership, go deep into the front lines, fully and deeply mobilize the masses, make a big splash in technical innovation and technical revolution, and earnestly promote effective advanced experiences. Continue to adhere to the enterprise management methods of the mass line of "two participations, one reform, four bigs, and three combinations." And take the "May 1st" Labor Day, the "October 1st" National Day, and the "New Year's Day" holiday as the rounds of national coal mine competition and evaluation, in order to guide the movement to deepen step by step, and strive to insert the red flag of high output, high quality, and large-scale bumper harvest all over the national coal mines. We believe that under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, and under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will be able to complete and overfulfill the production task of 380 million tons, and we will be able to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the coal industry in 1959.

    煤炭工业的跃进步伐
    煤炭工业部张霖之部长的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    一九五八年是全民全面大跃进的一年。全国人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，无论在政治、经济、文化、教育等各方面，都取得了伟大的胜利，使我国的国际威望大大提高，各民族之间兄弟般的团结大大加强，全国人民都在为这种史无前例的辉煌成就而欢欣鼓舞。但帝国主义和国内、外反动分子则千方百计地勾结起来，从各方面进行破坏。最近原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱就是一个明显的例证。他们勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派背叛祖国的罪行，是企图来分裂祖国，恢复帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力，和保存西藏落后的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度。国务院关于解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息叛乱的命令，得到了全国各族人民的热烈拥护和支持，特别受到西藏广大爱国僧俗人民的热烈欢迎，在他们的积极支持下，人民解放军西藏军区部队和西藏自治区筹备委员会已完全控制了西藏的局势，使西藏上层反动分子、帝国主义和国外反动派的阴谋遭到可耻的失败。使西藏人民将摆脱农奴制度的枷锁，实现民主自治和社会进步的伟大愿望。使人愤慨的是，帝国主义正在利用西藏的叛乱的事件，兴风作浪，经过印度的外交官员于四月十八日，散发了一个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，完全是荒谬无耻的捏造。干涉我国内政的行为，是我国人民绝对不能容忍的。中国被欺侮的时代已经过去了，帝国主义者和印度的扩张主义分子的阴谋一定遭到可耻的失败。
    一九五八年全国煤炭产量发展的速度是史无前例的
    现在，我将煤炭工业一九五八年技术革新、技术革命和一九五九年开展大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动的情况，向大会作一汇报。
    一九五八年全国煤炭产量由一九五七年的一亿三千万吨，一跃而为两亿七千万吨。这就使我国在煤炭产量上由一九五七年占世界第六位（美国、苏联、西德、民主德国、英国、中国），一跃而为第三位（苏联、美国、中国），并且把英国远远地抛在了后面（英国一九五八年实际产量二亿二千万吨左右）。一年增长的煤炭产量相当于第一个五年计划期内增长总和的两倍以上，相当于旧中国自一八七八年开始建设第一对现代化矿井起，到一九四二年（解放前最高年产量）六十四年内煤炭增长总和的二点三倍。煤炭产量由一亿三千万吨提高到二亿七千万吨，我国只用了一年的时间，美国用了十四年的时间，英国用了三十二年的时间。这种发展速度是史无前例的。
    人人献计个个献策，开展群众性的技术革新运动
    煤炭工业的特点是地下作业，工作条件比较困难，而且受着水、火、瓦斯和矽、煤尘等自然灾害的威胁。因此，广泛深入地开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，逐步制服自然灾害的威胁，实现安全生产，提高劳动生产率，高速度的发展煤炭工业，就具有特别重要的意义。一九五八年煤炭工业的全体职工，经过整风运动；发扬了苦干、实干和巧干的精神，开展了人人献计，个个献策，轰轰烈烈的群众性的技术革命运动。在运动中创造、总结和推行了三十六项重大的先进经验（属于生产的十二项，基本建设十四项，洗煤四项，机械制造六项），这是煤炭工业能够飞跃发展的重要关键。
  在煤炭生产过程中，紧紧抓住了以提高采煤工作面（即基层生产单位，下同）产量的中心环节，对生产组织和采煤技术进行了各方面的改革，这是煤炭产量迅速增长的重要因素。在生产组织方面，过去采煤工作面一般是采用两班生产、一班准备（每班工作八小时）的工作制度，去年有些矿井改用“四（班）八（小时）”交叉作业制，每天相对的增加了八小时的工作时间，即将每天二十四小时变为三十二小时的工作时间，有的矿井改用生产和准备混合作业制，实行了三班生产，都使煤炭产量增长了一倍。如峰峰矿务局四矿采用了“四、八”交叉作业，工作面的平均日产量由三百五十吨提高到七百五十吨，增长一倍多。峰峰三矿的一个工作面实行三班生产混合作业，使平均日产量，由三百吨提高到六百吨，增长了一倍。有些矿井推行“一炮一刀”的方法（过去在一个工作面上只用一种方法），即将溜子（链板运输机，下同）靠近煤壁，放一遍炮，采一次煤，然后再用康拜因采一次煤，这样，工作面的产量可提高一倍左右。如鸡西矿务局恒山矿推行这一经验后，工作面平均日产量由一百八十六吨提高到三百九十吨，增长一倍多。
    在采煤技术方面，很多矿井加长了截煤机的截盘，即把采煤用的截煤机的截盘，由过去的一点二至一点八公尺加长到二点二至三点二公尺。贾汪夏桥矿的一个工作面，推行了这一经验，使平均日产量由四百吨，增长到七百三十二吨，提高了百分之八十三。快速移溜子也是一项重大的技术革命，过去工作面移溜子的办法，是将溜子全部拆卸之后用人力挪移，需四小时之久。现在利用溜子上的电动机或回柱绞车将溜子挪移，只需要一小时到一小时半，这样就大大地增加了采煤时间。采煤工作面上的人工装煤，是采煤工作中用人最多和占时间最长的工序，而且是极其笨重的体力劳动。一九五八年许多煤矿采用了爆破装煤的办法，即把溜子靠近工作面，在打眼放炮后，使煤崩落在溜子上，一般可减少百分之五十左右的人工装煤量。
    水力采煤的出现和推广使我国采煤事业进入了一个新的阶段
    在大量革新一般技术的同时，对煤炭工业的先进技术，也进行了巨大的工作。主要试验推广了水力采煤这一先进技术。去年七月份，首先在开滦唐家庄矿建成第一座全部水力采煤矿井，经过几个月的努力和刻苦的钻研，基本上攻破了水力采煤过程中的水力落煤、水力运输（井下）、水力提升和脱水干燥等技术关。特别是水力提升的煤水泵，是水力采煤的中心关键，开始因对煤水泵的设计缺乏经验，使煤水经常侵入滚珠轴承，平均三、四天就损坏一次，不能正常生产。经过职工群众刻苦钻研，并吸取了贾汪煤矿的经验，把轴承移置在泵壳外和用高压清水密封，以及提高煤水泵的制造质量，加强维护等一系列措施，终于得到解决，正常运转已经有三个多月。水力采煤在我国虽然才开始采用，但已显示了它的优越性。根据开滦煤矿去年水力采煤与一般机械化采煤工作面的比较，水力采煤的劳动生产率比一般机械化采煤提高将近三倍，即可节省劳动力百分之六十至七十，坑木消耗减少百分之七十，成本降低百分之五十。特别是由于推行了水力采煤，彻底消灭了煤尘和基本上消灭了冒顶事故，得到广大职工和家属的热烈拥护。他们说：“水力采煤是：重活变轻活，劳动变娱乐（开水枪），黑脸变白脸，矿工容易找老婆”。水力采煤是煤炭工业今后发展的主要技术方向。水力采煤的出现和推广，将使我国采煤事业进入一个新的阶段。
    为了胜利地完成和超额完成一九五九年煤炭工业的生产建设任务，我们开展了大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动。这是充分发挥全体职工的无穷智慧和高度的生产热情，进一步挖掘现有企业生产潜力的最好途径。也就是在一切企业单位中，继续深入开展群众性的技术革命运动，以提高全部采煤工作面的产量，达到大面积丰产的目的。
    大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动已在全国煤矿企业中普遍展开，在短短的一个月的时间里，采煤工作面的产量有了显著的提高
    在去年大跃进中，出现了为数不少的高产工作面，创造了许多先进经验。但先进、一般与落后工作面的产量悬殊很大。不仅工作条件基本相同的工作面产量差别很大，而且有的工作面条件不好，但产量高；有的工作面条件好，产量低。如全国重点煤矿，厚煤层工作面平均月产七千七百三十五吨，中厚煤层工作面平均月产六千六百九十一吨。但有二十一个厚煤层和中厚煤层工作面（占厚煤层和中厚煤层工作面总数的百分之二）的月产量已达到二、三万吨。抚顺老虎台矿一区的一个工作面，月产达三万吨以上。薄煤层工作面平均月产四千零二十一吨，有九个工作面（占薄煤层工作面总数的百分之二点二）月产量已达到一万吨以上。鸡西滴道煤矿“二井六路”工作面月产量已达到一万八千吨。这就足以说明现有企业的生产潜力是很大的。为了广泛深入的发动群众，使落后的变先进，先进的更先进，我们制订了一个大面积丰产平均先进的红旗竞赛标准，要求厚煤层和中厚煤层的工作面平均月产达到万吨，薄煤层工作面达到七千吨，作为先进的标准。全国重点煤矿现有一千七百个采煤工作面，如果有百分之五十能够达到这个标准，工作面的产量就可以比去年提高百分之二十五左右，这是一个很大的潜力，而群众性大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动，则是挖掘这一潜力的钥匙。
    从二月底全国煤炭工业干部会议和三月初红旗竞赛广播大会以后，一个声势浩大、规模壮阔，以高产、高质为中心的大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动，已在全国煤矿企业中普遍展开。在这短短的一个月的时间里，充分显示了它的威力，采煤工作面的产量有了显著的提高。根据去年第四季度二十八个重点矿务局一千四百零八个采煤工作面的统计，达到月产万吨的有一百五十个，其中达到两万吨以上的三十三个；今年三月份月产达到万吨的有三百六十个，其中有七十二个达到二万吨以上。特别是开滦和抚顺煤矿三月份全部采煤工作面平均月产量达到一万三千吨以上。三月份二十八个重点矿务局的全部工作面平均月产量达到了七千七百五十一吨，比去年第四季度平均月产六千九百零八吨，提高了百分之十一，这是全国煤炭工业超额完成第一季度生产计划的主要原因。
    大面积丰产红旗竞赛，是以提高全部采煤工作面产量为基础，是以矿、矿务局或以省为单位，全部采煤工作面平均月产量达到万吨为目标展开的。因此，这就促使各级领导干部对一般和落后单位的关怀和帮助，许多局、矿长和党委书记深入现场、深入群众，采取抓两头带中间的方法，进行思想排队，工作面排队和薄弱环节的排队，找出关键，加以解决。改变了过去那种培养典型多，普遍推广少，满足先进事例，忽视提高一般的作法，大大鼓舞了全体职工的生产热忱。有的工人说：“过去领导干部只关心试验田，这回领导上关心我们了”，“上级过去光把煤车给先进队，这回也该我们队抬头了”，“干部能下海，我们就能擒龙”。在职工群众中造成了“别的能让，红旗不能让”，“谁英雄、谁好汉，月底评比来见面” 的气氛，过去落后的单位，一跃而达到先进的水平。如淄博洪山矿五十五采煤队在零点八五公尺薄煤层工作面中，由于政治挂帅，调整组织和技术改革，从二月份月产六千一百零二吨，提高到三月份的一万三千多吨，使产量翻了一番，比一贯先进的五十二队的月产量还超过了一千七百四十六吨。该矿一号立井四个薄煤层采煤工作面，过去只有一个达到月产万吨，三月份由于加强了领导，发动了群众，这四个工作面平均月产都在万吨以上。
    插上大面积丰产的红旗，是每一个企业单位全体职工的集体荣誉。在红旗竞赛运动中，广大职工群众共产主义的协作精神大为发扬，达到了互相追赶、互相学习、互相帮助、共同提高的目的。如开滦赵各庄矿的掘进工人，开展了“五满意”运动。即保证工程质量，使采区满意，监察部门满意；提早完成任务移交生产，叫领导满意；巷道合乎规格，叫安装队满意；三班协作，不留困难，叫三班工人满意。并相应的改进了爆破方法和操作技术，使赵各庄矿四个采煤工作面比原计划提前十五天移交了生产，保证了工程质量，而且真正作到了人人满意。
    煤炭工业战线上，大面积丰产的红旗竞赛运动正在蓬勃的开展，但运动发展的不够平衡。我们应该进一步加强领导，深入现场，全面深入的发动群众，大闹技术革新和技术革命，认真地推广行之有效的先进经验。继续坚持“两参、一改、四大、三结合”群众路线的企业管理方法。并把“五一”劳动节、“十一”国庆节和“元旦”节日，作为全国煤矿竞赛评比的回合，以引导运动步步深入，争取把高产、高质大面积丰产的红旗插遍全国煤矿。我们相信在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，就一定能够完成和超额完成三亿八千万吨的生产任务，一定能够实现煤炭工业一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进。
