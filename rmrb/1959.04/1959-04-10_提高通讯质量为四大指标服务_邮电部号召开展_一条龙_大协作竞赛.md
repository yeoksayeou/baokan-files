Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: The national postal and telecommunications workers will launch a "one-dragon" collaborative competition movement centered on technological revolution and aimed at improving communication quality and labor productivity, to ensure the realization of the four major indicators this year and the needs of the leap forward in various departments of the national economy for communication work. This is the appeal made by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications at the recently held Eighth National Postal and Telecommunications Work Conference.

The meeting pointed out that the major technical revolution in the postal and telecommunications sector is mainly to improve existing communication equipment and communication networks, transform existing circuits and postal transportation tools, to achieve the goal of improving communication quality and labor productivity in the postal and telecommunications sector. Facts have proved that there is still great potential in these areas. For example, a telephone branch bureau in Beijing, after improving the manual telephone exchange, not only increased the response rate by about six times, but also saved 70% of the operators. Since last year, after the national promotion of Shenyang's experience in improving telex telegraph machines and telegraph operators' operation methods, the telegraph circuit has been increased, and the telegraph quality has been improved. More than 300 telex machines have also been saved. In some mountainous areas, the postal transportation efficiency has been improved and the heavy physical labor has been reduced by improving the postal transportation tools.

The "one-dragon" collaborative competition movement proposed by the meeting is to carry out collaborative competition among workers of the same type of work or with business relations, up, down, left and right, on one circuit or one postal route. This competition is proposed in response to the characteristics of postal and telecommunications work and the specific situation of the postal and telecommunications sector. Because postal and telecommunications networks are interconnected, improving one task requires at least two or more links or two or more bureaus and offices to achieve. Therefore, to improve communication quality and labor productivity, in addition to carrying out technical revolution and technical innovation on a large scale, it largely depends on the close cooperation of all links in the entire communication process. Carrying out the "one-dragon" competition movement will strongly promote closer cooperation among all links.

The meeting believes that in order to further improve communication quality and labor productivity, it is also necessary to continue to formulate some new and necessary rules and regulations on the basis of last year's destruction and establishment, and implement them after approval by the relevant leading organs.

The postal and telecommunications institutions of the People's Communes are often the starting point and end of postal and telecommunications communication transmission and operation, and they are widely distributed, so it is necessary to strengthen the postal and telecommunications work of the People's Communes. The meeting required the postal and telecommunications institutions of the People's Communes in various places to strive to improve their work, pay attention to the organizational layout of the communication network, and establish a number of management systems suitable for the specific conditions of the communes, so that the postal and telecommunications sector's competition can achieve a comprehensive victory.

The meeting believes that in the mass movement in the postal and telecommunications sector, leaders at all levels must pay attention to grasping indicators, measures, and comparisons, and use the "five goods" and "four comparisons" as the content of the comparison. The five goods are: good service attitude, good elimination of errors and accidents, good completion of time limit indicators, good neatness and cleanliness, and good cooperation; the four comparisons are comparison of ideology, comparison of work style, comparison of diligence and thrift, and comparison of drive.

The meeting called on postal and telecommunications workers across the country to launch several production upsurges this year, so that workers in various types of work can create more new achievements, and strive to have more advanced collectives and advanced producers' representatives to go to Beijing to attend the National Congress of Heroes.

### 提高通讯质量为四大指标服务  邮电部号召开展“一条龙”大协作竞赛

    提高通讯质量为四大指标服务
    邮电部号召开展“一条龙”大协作竞赛
    据新华社8日讯　全国邮电职工将开展以技术革命为中心，以提高通讯质量和劳动生产率为目的的“一条龙”大协作竞赛运动，保证今年实现四大指标和国民经济各部门大跃进对于通讯工作的需要。这是邮电部最近召开的第八次全国邮电工作会议提出的号召。
    会议指出：邮电部门大闹技术革命，主要是改进现有通讯设备和通讯网路，改造现有电路和邮运工具，达到提高通讯质量和邮电部门劳动生产率的目的。事实证明，这些方面目前还有很大的潜力。例如北京市一个电话分局，把人工电话交换机加以改进后，不但应答率提高了六倍左右，还节约了70％的话务员。去年以来，全国推广沈阳市改进电传电报机和报务员操作方法的经验后，增加了电报电路，提高了电报质量。还节约了三百多部电传电报机。有些山区，由于改进了邮政运输工具，减轻了笨重的体力劳动，提高了邮运效率。
    会议提出的“一条龙”大协作竞赛运动，就是在一条电路或一条邮路上，开展同工种的或有业务关系的上下左右职工之间的协作竞赛。这个竞赛是针对邮电工作的特点和目前邮电部门的具体情况提出来的。因为邮电的网路互有联系，每改进一项工作，至少需要两个以上的环节或两个以上的局所来实现。因此，要提高通讯质量和劳动生产率，除了大搞技术革命和技术革新以外，在很大程度上取决于全部通讯过程中各个环节的密切协作。开展“一条龙”竞赛运动，将有力地推动各个环节进一步密切合作。
    会议认为：为了进一步提高通讯质量和提高劳动生产率，还必须在去年有破有立的基础上，继续订立一些新的、必需的规章制度，经有关领导机关批准后执行。
    人民公社的邮电机构，往往是邮电通信传递和运转的起点和末梢，而且分布很广，必须加强人民公社的邮电工作。会议要求各地人民公社的邮电机构努力提高工作，注意通讯网路的组织布局，建立若干适合公社具体情况的管理制度，使邮电部门的竞赛取得全面胜利。
    会议认为，在邮电部门大搞群众运动中，各级领导必须注意抓指标、抓措施、抓评比，并以“五好”和“四比”作为评比的内容。五好即：服务态度好，消灭差错事故好，完成时限指标好，整齐清洁好，协作配合好；四比即比思想、比作风、比勤俭、比干劲。
    会议号召全国邮电职工在今年内掀起几个生产高潮，让各个工种的职工都能创造出更多的新成绩，争取有更多的先进集体和先进生产者代表，上北京出席全国群英大会。
