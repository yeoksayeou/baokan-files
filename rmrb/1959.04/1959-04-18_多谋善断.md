Decisiveness through Thorough Deliberation
Chen Zhiyan

　　Decisiveness through thorough deliberation – this is an important working method that Comrade Mao Zedong often advocated.

　　Whether a task is handled correctly and whether the results are good, especially when dealing with matters of principle and policy, is often closely related to “deliberation” and “decision.” With thorough deliberation and sound judgment, the chances of success are high; with little deliberation and indecisiveness, or with arbitrary decisions without deliberation, things often get messed up.

　　What is deliberation? It means considering the issue very carefully. It means examining all aspects of the matter, gaining understanding, which is what we often say: making human subjective understanding conform to objective laws. When the subjective and objective are unified, things can be accomplished smoothly. Usually, to solve a problem, we talk, discuss, consult, and consider, all to avoid acting arbitrarily and strive to solve the problem well through "thorough deliberation."

　　Any objective thing is a unity of contradictions. Contradictions have many aspects. To understand a matter, we must understand all sides of its contradictions, and all sides of the contradictions are not fully exposed at once, so they often cannot be fully understood at the beginning. This requires more observation, more consideration, more consultation, which is to say, thorough deliberation. If deliberation is insufficient, consideration is lacking, consultation is inadequate, and insufficient attention is paid to the opinions of all parties, it is difficult to grasp all aspects of the contradiction of things, and it is difficult to correctly understand objective things. Under such circumstances, rashly making a decision will lead to mistakes.

　　The best and most fundamental method of "thorough deliberation" is to follow the mass line. The methods of work such as extensive airing of views, big debates, etc., created in the rectification movement, are all methods of "thorough deliberation" of the mass line. By using these methods, on the one hand, we can further improve the relationship between people, and on the other hand, we can listen to the opinions of the majority, fully understand all sides of the contradiction (problem), and make it easier for us to find the correct way to overcome the contradiction (solve the problem). Zhuge Liang in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms was resourceful and prescient. In fact, he was not a god, but when dealing with problems, he could examine them from positive and negative sides, from the aspects of weather, geography, and human relationships, so he could judge problems more accurately and achieve victory.

　　In our era, the broad masses are Zhuge Liang. Constantly listening to the opinions of the masses and concentrating the wisdom of the masses is the prerequisite for doing a good job, especially leadership work, and it is the best policy for "thorough deliberation."

　　After "deliberating," we must "decide." "Decide" means making a resolution. In the past, when we fought wars, the chief of staff would always draft several operational plans based on the enemy's situation, our situation, and the possible changes, and then submit them to the commander. At the meeting convened by the commander, the plans would be fully discussed, and then a decision would be made to adopt one of the operational plans.

　　Making a decision is very important. Deliberating without deciding often delays work. Talking back and forth still remains on paper and in words, unable to solve practical problems, and missing opportunities. Little deliberation and indecisiveness cannot accurately understand objective reality and easily miss opportunities and be in a passive position. As for arbitrary decisions without deliberation and subjectivism, the results are certainly worse. "Deliberation" is the basis of "decision." "Thorough deliberation" is the key to "sound judgment." "Deliberation" is for the sake of "decision." Indecisiveness is also bad. We must deliberate thoroughly and seize the opportunity to make decisive decisions, clearly deciding whether to do this or not. This is an art that a leader must master. Only in this way can we continuously advance our cause.

　　Here is a question. Does thorough deliberation to achieve sound judgment mean that a correct decision can only be made based on the opinions of the majority? This cannot be generalized. Indeed, in many cases, the same view of the majority is often correct. Things that eight or nine out of ten people agree with are often largely in line with or close to reality. However, this is not fixed. It is also possible that the opinion of one person is correct, while the opinion of the majority is incorrect or incomplete. If you don't believe it, please see the article "A Garden Full of Spring" on page 2 of this newspaper on March 30.

　　This newsletter is very interesting. Its content is about how the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory carried out a major technical revolution through the three-way combination of cadres, workers, and technicians. The three-way combination is a method of "thorough deliberation" of the mass line. The newsletter narrates the following: The Dongfeng brand diesel engine produced by this factory had a newly designed important part—the oil pump. The workers believed that the design structure was too complicated and the processing was too troublesome. They proposed to modify the design to save raw materials, reduce man-hours, and speed up manufacturing. However, some technicians disagreed with the modification. Modifying the product design is, of course, a matter of principle in the factory, and since some technicians disagree, it is even more necessary to deliberate carefully. Therefore, the general party branch of the workshop decided to organize a debate meeting with cadres, workers, and technicians to solve the problem by following the mass line. As a result of the first debate, ten of the sixteen suggestions for modifying the parts of the oil pump put forward by the workers were agreed to by the technicians, and most of the problems were solved. In the second debate, after debate and on-the-spot testing, five more suggestions were passed. It can be said that 96% of the problems were solved, and only one item remained unresolved. This item was the oil return hole. The workers suggested canceling it and found an old oil pump without an oil return hole to prove that it was possible to cancel the oil return hole. However, engineer Wu Longge insisted that it could not be canceled, because he believed that canceling it would affect the life of the oil pump. The two sides argued endlessly, and Wu Longge was in the minority, with only he alone objecting. It seemed that Wu Longge was isolated, and there was clearly an old oil pump without an oil return hole next to him. However, Shen Baolin, the director of the workshop, did not immediately adopt the opinions of the majority this time. At that time, he firmly believed that further research was needed. He took the old oil pump to discuss with Wu Longge again. Wu Longge continued to state his reasons, and finally, after testing, it was proved that Wu Longge's opinion was correct. At this time, Shen Baolin resolutely denied the opinion of canceling the oil return hole, denied the incorrect opinion of the majority, and finally affirmed the correct opinion of one person.

　　What does this example illustrate? It shows that sometimes on some issues, the opinions of a few people, or even the opinions insisted on by only one person, are often correct, while the opinions of the majority are incorrect. This is not surprising either. Whether an opinion is correct or not depends on whether it conforms to objective reality. A person can put forward correct opinions because he understands objective laws. The majority has not yet understood objective laws, so their opinions, although consistent and numerous, are incorrect. Therefore, a leader must not only deliberate thoroughly and judge wisely, be good at affirming the correct opinions of the majority, but also be good at judging that the opinions of the minority may also be correct.

　　With the continuous development of socialist construction, our economic work must be done more and more meticulously. This means that we must "deliberate thoroughly" in everything, conduct more investigations and studies, consider repeatedly, and listen to the opinions of all parties, including opposing opinions and the opinions of the minority. After full consideration, we must make a decisive decision and not be indecisive. When "making a decision," we must consider the opinions of the majority and the opinions of the minority. Whoever has the truth should stand on their side.

　　多谋善断
　　陈之衍
    多谋善断——这是毛泽东同志经常提倡的重要的工作方法。
    办一件事情，特别是办一些带有原则性、方针性的事情，办得正确不正确，效果好不好，往往同“谋”和“断”有很大关系。多谋善断，事情成功的希望就大，少谋寡断或者不谋独断，往往把事情弄糟。
    何谓谋？就是对问题考虑得很周到。对于事情的各个方面都进行了考察，有了认识，也就是我们常说的：使人的主观认识符合于客观规律。主客观统一起来了，事情就能办通了。我们平常为了解决一个问题，谈一谈、议一议、商量商量、考虑考虑，都是为了避免独断独行，力求经过“多谋”去很好地解决问题。
    任何客观事物，都是矛盾的统一体。矛盾是多方面的。要认识一件事情，必须了解它的各个矛盾的侧面，而各个矛盾的侧面又并不是一下子就完全暴露出来，因而也就常常不能在开始的时候就能够被完全了解。这就需要多观察，多考虑，多商量，也就是多谋。谋而不多，考虑不够，商量不够，倾听各方面的意见不够，就难于把握事物的矛盾的各个侧面，就难于正确认识客观事物。在这种情况下轻下决心，就会犯错误。
    “多谋”的最好的最根本的方法，就是走群众路线。在整风运动中创造出来的大鸣大放大辩论等等工作方法，都是群众路线的“多谋”的方法。运用这些方法，一方面可以进一步改进人与人之间的关系，一方面又可以听取多数人的意见，充分认识矛盾（问题）的各个侧面，便于我们找到正确地克服矛盾（解决问题）的途径。三国演义中的诸葛亮足智多谋，料事如神，其实他并不是神仙，只不过他处理问题时，能从正面反面，从天时、地利、人和等各个方面去进行考察，因而能够比较准确地判断问题，取得胜利。
    在我们的时代里，广大群众就是诸葛亮，经常地倾听群众的意见，集中群众的智慧，是做好工作，特别是领导工作的前提，是“多谋”的上策。
    “谋”了以后必须“断”。“断”就是下决心。过去我们打仗的时候，开始总是由参谋长根据敌我情势以及可能发生的变化，拟出几个作战方案，然后提交司令员，在司令员召集的会议上经过充分的讨论，然后下决心，采纳其中一个作战方案。
    下决心是非常重要的。谋而不断，常常延误工作，谈来谈去，还是停留在纸面上、口头上，不能解决实际问题，丧失了时机。少谋寡断，既不能准确地认识客观实际，又容易丧失时机，处于被动。至于不谋独断，主观主义，其结果当然更坏。“谋”是“断”的基础。“多谋”才能“善断”。“谋”是为了“断”。优柔寡断也是不好的。既要多谋，又要抓住时机，当机立断，明确地断定这样办或不这样办，这是一个领导人员所必须掌握的艺术。只有这样，才能把我们的事业，不断地向前推进。
    这儿有一个问题。多谋才能善断，是否就是意味着只有根据多数人的意见才能作出正确的决定呢？不能一概而论。确实，在许多的情况下，多数人的同一看法，常常是正确的。十个人中有八个九个人都赞成的事，也常常是大体上是符合或接近实际的。然而这并不是铁定的。也有一个人的意见是正确的，而多数人的意见是不正确或不完全的。如若不信，请看3月30日本报第二版题为“满园春色”的一篇通讯。
    这篇通讯很有意思。它的内容是谈上海柴油机厂怎样通过干部、工人、技术人员三结合来大闹技术革命。三结合，这就是一种群众路线的“多谋”的方法。通讯叙述的事情是这样：这个工厂生产的东风牌的柴油机上有一个新设计的重要部件——机油泵，工人们认为设计的结构太复杂，加工太费事，提出来要修改设计，以便节省原料、减少工时和加快制造速度。可是有些技术人员不同意修改。修改产品设计，这在工厂里说来，当然是个带有原则性的问题，而何况有些技术人员又不同意，这就更需要仔细谋虑了。于是车间党总支决定组织一次干部、工人、技术人员在一起开的辩论会，走群众路线来解决问题。第一次辩论的结果，工人们提出的十六项修改机油泵零件的建议，有十项取得了技术人员的同意，问题大部分解决了。第二次辩论，经过争论、当场试验，又有五项建议通过了。问题可以说解决了96％，只剩下一项，没有通过。这一项就是回油孔。工人建议取消它，并且找来了一只没有回油孔的旧机油泵，来证明取消回油孔是可以的。可是工程师吴隆葛坚持不能取消，他认为取消了会影响机油泵的寿命。双方争持不下，而吴隆葛是少数，只有他一个人提反对意见。看样子，吴隆葛是孤立的，旁边又明明摆着一只没有回油孔的旧机油泵，但是，车间主任沈保林这一次并没有立即就采纳多数人的意见。他当时坚决地认为需要继续研究。他又拿着这只旧机油泵去找吴隆葛商量，吴隆葛继续申述他的理由，最后又作了试验，证明吴隆葛的意见是正确的，这时，沈保林才断然否定了取消回油孔的意见，否定了多数人的不正确的意见，最后肯定了一个人的正确意见。
    这个例子说明了什么呢？它说明了有时在有些问题上，少数人的意见，甚至只有一个人坚持的意见往往也是正确的，而多数人的意见却是不正确的。这也并不奇怪，意见正确与否，在于它是否符合客观实际。一个人由于他认识了客观规律，因而他能提出正确的意见。多数人由于还没有认识客观规律，因而他们的意见虽然一致，虽然是多数，但却是不正确的。因此，一个领导者，既要多谋，又要善断，不仅要善于肯定多数人的正确意见，同时也要善于判断少数人的意见也可能是正确的。
    随着社会主义建设的不断发展，我们的经济工作必须愈做愈细致。这就是说必须事事“多谋”，多调查研究，多反复考虑，多倾听各方面的意见，包括反面的意见、少数人的意见。在充分地考虑之后，就必须当机立断，而不要优柔寡断。在“立断”的时候，既要考虑多数人的意见，也要考虑少数人的意见。谁掌握真理，就应当站在谁的一边。
