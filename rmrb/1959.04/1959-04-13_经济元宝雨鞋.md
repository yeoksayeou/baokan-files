    Economical Yuanbao Rain Boots
    The Beijing Joint State-Private New China Rubber Factory has recently trial-produced a type of economical Yuanbao rain boot. The style of these Yuanbao rain boots is the same as ordinary all-rubber Yuanbao rain boots, except that the upper half of the shoe surface is made of 21-count cotton interlock fabric with a rubber coating. It has good elasticity, and its waterproofness and sturdiness are the same as those of all-rubber Yuanbao rain boots, but it can save raw rubber. The cost is about 10 percent lower than all-rubber Yuanbao rain boots.

    经济元宝雨鞋
    北京公私合营新华橡胶厂，最近又试制了一种经济元宝雨鞋。这种元宝雨鞋与一般全胶元宝雨鞋式样一样，只是鞋面的上半部是采用二十一支棉毛布刮胶制成的。富有伸缩性能，防水性和坚固程度和全胶元宝雨鞋相同，但可节约生胶。成本较全胶元宝雨鞋约低百分之十左右。
