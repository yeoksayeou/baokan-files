    Miscellaneous Thoughts on Ascending a Tower
  　Li Dazhao
  I lament that glorious time flows like water, the scenery of lakes and mountains fills me with endless sorrow. I am startled to hear of barbarian horses galloping in the northern frontier, and weep as a captive of Chu wearing southern garb in vain. I have hidden resentment for ten years regarding my family and country, and how many heroes' graves have become desolate over thousands of years. The vastness of the sea and sky fades into passing clouds, I lean alone against the railing in the west wind, shedding tears.
  Sending to a Friend at the End of the Year　Li DazhaoThe rivers and mountains remain as before, but the scenery is completely different.
  Hatred of nine generations can be avenged, the wishes of ten years have not been defied. The swallows of the Liao palace in the past, now fly to the Han home. The military dispatches are urgent at the end of the year, I wonder if the travelers have returned? Several years have passed without seeing each other, and time has changed again. More than twenty years of lofty aspirations, a thousand miles to send new poems. With generosity, I think of throwing away the pen, but it is difficult to leave poetry. When should we drive away the northern barbarians and plant the flags of Han everywhere.
  Poems from Prison　Yun DaiyingWandering the rivers and lakes, I recall past travels, old friends' lives and deaths are separated by vast distances, I have already banished worries and hardships as ordinary things, and retain heroic feelings as a captive of Chu.
  Walking in Shackles　Liu BojianWalking in shackles along the long street, staggering again and again, the people of the city compete to watch, my heart is without shame. Walking in shackles along the long street, the sound of the shackles is so sonorous, the people of the city are all surprised, my heart is at ease. Walking in shackles along the long street, my ambition is even more exuberant, I am willing to be a prisoner of the court, so that the workers and peasants are liberated together.
  Poem Before Execution　Yang ChaoThe sky is full of wind and rain, the sky is full of sorrow, why should the revolution fear being beheaded? If the heroic spirit of Wu Zixu remains, I will return to avenge the hatred of King Chu in three years!
  A Contribution to New Poets　Deng ZhongxiaThe vast Dongting Lake, crossed twice in five days, snow waves beat the long sky, and a gloomy suspicion of ghosts. I ask what world this is now? The jackals and tigers are full of roads, and I remove the beasts, my actions are according to my nature. The vast Dongting Lake, crossed twice in five days, the autumn water contains the setting sun, and the colorful clouds are like red pillars, I ask what world this will be? Communism equalizes poverty and wealth, I manage it arduously, my actions are according to my nature.

    登楼杂感
  　李大钊
  感慨韶华似水流，湖山对我不胜愁。惊闻北塞驰胡马，空着南冠泣楚囚。家国十年多隐恨，英雄千载几荒丘。海天寥落闲云去，泪洒西风独倚楼。
  岁晚寄友　李大钊江山依旧是，风景已全非。
  九世仇堪报，十年愿未违。辽宫昔时燕，今向汉家飞。岁晚军书急，行人归未归？几载不相见，沧桑又一时。廾年余壮志，千里寄新诗。慷慨思投笔，艰难未去诗。何当驱漠北，遍树汉家旗。
  狱中诗恽代英浪迹江湖忆旧游，故人生死各千秋，已摈忧患寻常事，留得豪情作楚囚。
  带镣行　刘伯坚带镣长街行，蹒跚复蹒跚，市人争属目，我心无愧怍。带镣长街行，镣声何铿锵，市人皆惊讶，我心自安详。带镣长街行，志气愈轩昂，拼作阶下囚，工农齐解放。
  就义诗　杨超满天风雨满天愁，革命何须怕断头？留得子胥豪气在，三年归报楚王仇！
  贡献给新诗人　邓中夏莽莽洞庭湖，五日两飞渡，雪浪拍长空，阴森疑鬼路。问今为何世？豺虎满道路，禽猕残除之，我行适我素。莽莽洞庭湖，五日两飞渡，秋水含落辉，彩霞如赤炷，问将为何世？共产均贫富，惨淡经营之，我行适我素。
