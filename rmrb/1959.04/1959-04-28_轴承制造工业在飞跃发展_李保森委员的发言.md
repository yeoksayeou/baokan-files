Bearing Manufacturing Industry in Leaps and Bounds
Speech by Committee Member Li Baosen

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of other central responsible comrades, and I express my determination to contribute all my strength under the leadership of the Party to fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 plan.

I fully support the Central Committee's policy on Tibet and the measures taken to completely quell the Tibetan rebellion. The former Tibetan local government and a handful of upper-class reactionary groups, colluding with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, carried out a counter-revolutionary rebellion to split the unification of the motherland, which aroused great anger among the people of the whole country. It has now met with a shameful defeat. We severely warn the imperialists and Indian expansionists that any of your conspiracies and attempts to split our country's territory will be crushed by the people of our country and will end in a complete and shameful failure.

As an engineering and technical personnel in the bearing manufacturing industry, I am extremely excited to see the leap-forward development of China's bearing industry since liberation. At the time of liberation, old China only had a dilapidated and outdated colonial bearing factory, which could only manufacture rings but not steel balls and cages, and could not independently produce complete sets of bearings. However, under the correct leadership of the Party, the creativity and enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers have been fully exploited, overcoming numerous difficulties. In 1949, China successfully trial-produced bearing parts that had never been produced before - steel balls and cages, and initially mastered the technology of complete set production, writing a glorious first page in the history of China's bearing industry. In the following years, the bearing industry, like other industries, has achieved leap-forward development in terms of output, product quality, and production technology management due to the resolute implementation of the Party's policies at different times and the continuous improvement of the political and ideological awareness of the broad masses of workers. In particular, in 1958, on the basis of the complete victory of the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification movement, a mass technical revolution movement was launched. The communist ideas of the broad masses of bearing industry workers were renewed, and with soaring drive, after implementing the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, walking on two legs" and the method of "two participations and three combinations," all aspects of production technology have achieved an unprecedented great leap forward. In terms of output, the national output of bearings in 1958 exceeded the total output during the first Five-Year Plan period, which was 207 times the output in 1949 at the beginning of liberation. Compared with 1952, the output also increased by 30 times; in terms of product variety, we have now mastered about 2,000 varieties, from precision instrument bearings with a minimum inner diameter of 1 mm to heavy-duty bearings for rolling mills with an outer diameter of more than 1 meter. In addition, advanced technology products such as ultra-precision bearings for precision machine tools, high-speed bearings, high-temperature-resistant bearings, and corrosion-resistant bearings have been successfully trial-produced and put into production. In terms of production technology management, it has also transitioned from repair and assembly production to design standardization, process typification, and tool serialization and generalization, carrying out regular production. It is currently developing rapidly towards machine tool specialization and production automation.

Under the unified planning of the Central Committee, the number of bearing production enterprises has been continuously increasing, including new factories fully designed and equipped with Soviet assistance and old factories mainly renovated by Soviet equipment, many local bearing factories, as well as the metallurgical industry that produces high-quality bearing steel, the machine tool industry, and the tool and grinding wheel industry, which have all achieved corresponding development and have basically become a complete system. It has now begun to supply complete sets of technology and technical equipment to support our brother countries.

In 1958, the vast number of peasants in rural areas all over China actively responded to the call of the Party Central Committee on "rolling bearing for farm tools," and produced tens of millions of farm tool bearings using both foreign and indigenous methods, saving a large amount of rural labor.

In just a few years, China's bearing industry has developed from an extremely backward state into an independent and modernized industry. This speed of development is unprecedented and is one of the brilliant examples on the various production fronts of China's socialist construction. This is the result of the correct leadership of the Party, the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, and the resolute implementation of the Party's policies by the broad masses of bearing industry workers. This is a great victory for the Party's general line of socialist construction.

Relatively speaking, the bearing industry in China is still an emerging industry. It has already played a huge role in the development of China's entire national economy and has become an important part of China's industrial system. Bearings are indispensable parts in all mechanical equipment, from small instruments and spinning spindles to automobiles, airplanes, and heavy machine tools, rolling mills, etc. Wherever there is power and the need to turn, bearings must be used. Therefore, "bearings are the soul of all machinery. The level of development and the extent of use of rolling bearings have always been an important indicator of a country's industrial level." (See the People's Daily editorial on July 26, 1958, "A Major Event in the Farm Tool Revolution") This fully illustrates the importance of bearings in the national economy.

In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, China's bearing industry has achieved a leap-forward development. In order to cooperate with the continued leap forward in all aspects of the country, the tasks of the bearing industry in 1959 are more arduous than those in 1958, especially the variety and time constraints required for the six major equipment. However, I firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, with soaring revolutionary vigor, through deeply carrying out a national mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, and taking all measures to tap internal potential, the bearing industry will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties to fulfill and overfulfill the glorious task of 1959.

Under the guidance of the Central Committee's policy of "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward," I would like to offer a few immature opinions on the further rational development of the bearing industry, based on my personal experience:

(1) The problem of designated supply of materials, equipment, and tools required by the bearing industry

In the past few years, the Central Committee has made comprehensive arrangements for the production of raw materials, special machine tools, tools, grinding wheels, etc. used by the bearing industry, and has achieved great results. In order to better support the bearing industry, it is best to further stipulate designated supply, and make systematic arrangements based on current needs and development prospects, so as to lay a reliable material foundation for ensuring the current tasks and rational development of the bearing industry.

(2) Accelerate the construction of backbone enterprises in China's bearing industry

In the leap-forward development of socialist construction, the needs for bearings in all aspects have multiplied, which brings very arduous and glorious tasks to the bearing industry. In the development of the bearing industry, the construction of new factories and the expansion of old factories have different roles. Accelerating the expansion of old factories requires less investment and achieves faster results. However, considering the long-term plan, in order to develop the entire bearing industry on the most economical and reasonable basis, it depends on the early establishment of new bearing factories. The advantage is that the new factories can fully utilize the results of the technical revolution of the old factories from scratch, and can strengthen specialization. The variety types are simpler. Under the principle of the central support to the local, the old factory contracting to be responsible for supporting the new factory, the new factory can grow rapidly, and in two or three years can reach the design level and become a new backbone enterprise to meet the needs of the rapid development of the national economy in all aspects.

In order to cooperate with the continued leap forward in the bearing industry, establishing bearing repair factories in the central cities of appropriate provinces and cities has great economic value. Repairing bearings and rings does not require new blanks, and steel balls can be used after being changed from large to small. Only a part of the steel balls needs to be supplemented and the cage needs to be replaced. If used and maintained reasonably and replaced in time, general bearings can be repaired two to three times and still maintain standard-level accuracy. Given the extremely large number of bearings used in all aspects of our country, repairing bearings can not only create a large amount of wealth for the country, but also has great practical significance.

(3) Develop new varieties and control non-standard varieties

In the development of the national economy, all aspects have major, sophisticated, and cutting-edge new products, so the bearing industry also has a variety of new variety requirements. This requirement is reasonable and must be met. However, there are also cases where the factors of trying to use standard model bearings as much as possible are not considered in the design, which increases the production varieties of bearing enterprises and is not conducive to further improving production capacity. Therefore, reasonable control of the development of new non-standard bearing varieties is a very important task at present. At the same time, strengthening technical guidance on the rational installation, use, and maintenance of bearings can also effectively extend the service life of bearings in various enterprises.

(4) Strengthen collaboration and develop new technologies

In the great leap forward in 1958, the bearing industry launched a vigorous mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, which is currently forming a new upsurge. Under the brilliant light of the general line, the broad masses of workers have established a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and have put forward many new technical innovation directions, which have very significant and far-reaching implications for the future development of the bearing industry. At present, many universities and scientific research units have closely cooperated with bearing factories to develop new technologies and have achieved great results, fully demonstrating the correctness of the Central Committee's policy of "combining scientific research, teaching, and production." In improving bearing ring blanks, new processes such as stamping, extrusion, and thermal shaping have been successfully tested, and it is planned to further use pipe material to cut ring forming and rolling, and gradually develop towards precision forging. The material utilization rate can be increased to 60% to 70%. If universally realized and promoted, it can save the country tens of thousands of tons of high-quality alloy steel every year. At the same time, the geometric accuracy of the blanks after precision forging is very high, basically close to eliminating turning processing, which can save a large number of turning machine tools, tools, and power consumption. In terms of production automation, many factories have gained a lot of experience in adding automatic devices to old machine tools. For example, Harbin Bearing Factory and Harbin Institute of Technology have closely cooperated and have designed a series of precision, simplified, and high-efficiency fully automatic machine tools specifically for the bearing industry. The first type has been successfully trial-produced, with good performance and a doubled output, and can be universally promoted. Strengthening collaboration and organizing relevant machine tool factories and scientific research units to focus on the development of precision forging and automation and other new technologies in the bearing industry will not only unprecedentedly improve the bearing industry's process level and production capacity, but also correspondingly greatly reduce the burden on the metallurgical industry and the machine tool industry. I believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, brilliant achievements will definitely be achieved rapidly.

(5) Strengthen the training of new technical forces

The bearing industry is an emerging industry. Due to the rapid development speed, the technical force of various bearing factories and bearing research institutes is relatively weak and the tasks they undertake are somewhat incompatible. In 1958, various bearing factories vigorously carried out a mass cultural revolution to cooperate with the high tide of the technical revolution, and have achieved remarkable results. The cultural and technical level of workers has been greatly improved. In order to accelerate the training of intermediate and senior technical personnel, it is best to set up some bearing specialty courses in universities and technical secondary schools, or to open several bearing specialty classes, and the bearing factories and research institutes provide technical information as teaching materials, and provide students with practical operation and other training convenience conditions, so that the new technical forces can grow rapidly to meet the needs of the rapidly developing bearing industry.

The above opinions are very immature, please criticize and correct them at the conference.

Finally, I wish the conference a successful success and all members good health.

### 轴承制造工业在飞跃发展  李保森委员的发言

专栏：

    轴承制造工业在飞跃发展
    李保森委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告和其他中央负责同志的报告，并表示一定要在党的领导下，为完成和超额完成一九五九年计划，贡献出一切力量。
    我完全拥护中央对西藏地方的方针和彻底平定西藏叛乱的措施，原西藏地方政府和一小撮上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，进行分裂祖国统一的反革命叛乱，引起了全国人民极大的愤怒，目前已遭到了可耻的失败，我们严重警告帝国主义者和印度的扩张主义者，你们任何阴谋诡计，分裂我国领土的企图都将被我国全国人民所粉碎而归于彻底的可耻的失败。
    作为一个轴承制造工业的工程技术人员，看到解放以来，我国轴承工业的飞跃发展，感到无比兴奋。在解放时旧中国仅留下一个残缺不全，设备陈旧的殖民地性质的轴承工厂，只能制造套圈，不能制造钢球和保持架，不能独立生产成套轴承。然而在党的正确领导下，充分发挥了广大职工的创造性和积极性，战胜了重重困难，在一九四九年试制成功了我国从未生产过的轴承配件——钢球和保持架，初步掌握了成套生产的技术，为中国轴承工业史写下了光辉的第一页。此后几年内，轴承工业和其他工业一样，由于坚决贯彻了党在不同时期的方针政策，广大职工政治思想觉悟不断提高，因此无论在产量上、产品质量上、生产技术管理上都获得了飞跃的发展，特别是一九五八年在反右斗争、整风全胜的基础上，开展了群众性的技术革命运动，轴承工业广大职工共产主义思想焕发，鼓起冲天干劲，贯彻“洋土并举、两条腿走路”的方针和“两参三结合”的方法后，使生产技术各方面都获得了空前的大跃进。从产量来看，一九五八年全国轴承的产量超过了第一个五年计划期间的总产量，为解放初期一九四九年产量的二百零七倍。如以一九五八年和一九五二年相比，产量也上升了三十倍；从产品品种来看，目前已经掌握了二千左右个品种，从最小内径一公厘的精密仪表轴承、到外径一公尺以上的轧钢机用的重型轴承，此外还有精密机床用的超精密级轴承、高速轴承、耐高温轴承、抗腐蚀轴承等尖端技术产品都已试制成功并开始投入生产。生产技术管理方面，也已由修配生产过渡到设计标准化、工艺典型化、工具系列化通用化，进行正正规规生产。目前正迅速向机床专用化，生产自动化方面发展。
    在中央的统一规划下，轴承生产企业不断增加，其中有苏联全面帮助设计并装备起来的新厂和主要由苏联装备改建的老厂，许多地方轴承厂，此外还有生产优质轴承钢的冶金工业，机床工业，和工具磨具工业等，都获得了相应的发展并已基本上成为一个完整的体系，目前已开始供应成套技术和技术装备来支援我们的兄弟国家。
    一九五八年，我国各地农村广大农民，积极响应了党中央关于“农具滚珠轴承化”的号召，用洋土并举的办法，生产了数以千万计的农具用轴承，节省了大量的农村劳动力。
    我国轴承工业在短短的几年内，从极端落后的状态，发展成为一个独立的近代化的工业，这样发展的速度是史无前例的，是我国社会主义建设中各生产战线上光辉范例之一，这是在党的正确领导下，在苏联的无私帮助下，轴承工业广大职工坚决贯彻党的方针政策的结果，这是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利。
    轴承工业在我国说来，还是一个新兴的工业，在我国整个国民经济发展中，已经起了巨大的作用，成为我国工业体系中的重要组成部分之一，轴承是一切机械装备中必不可少的零件，从小型的仪表，纺纱锭子到汽车、飞机和重型机床，轧钢机等，凡是有动力，需要转的，都要采用。因此“轴承是一切机械的灵魂。滚珠轴承发展的高度和使用的广泛程度，从来就是衡量一个国家工业水平的重要标志”。（见人民日报一九五八年七月二十六日社论“农具革命中的一件大事”）充分说明了轴承在国民经济中的重要性。
    我国轴承工业，几年来在党的领导下，获得了飞跃的发展，为了配合全国各方面继续跃进，轴承工业在一九五九年的任务比一九五八年的任务更为艰巨，尤其是六大设备要求的品种多时间性强，但是我深信在党的领导下鼓起冲天革命干劲，通过深入开展一个全民的以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产约节运动，采取一切措施，挖掘内部潜力，轴承工业一定能够克服一切困难来完成和超额完成一九五九年的光荣任务。
    在中央“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针指导下，在轴承工业进一步合理发展方面，就我个人体会，提出几点不成熟的意见：
    （一）轴承工业所需材料、设备、工具的定点供应问题
    以往几年内中央对轴承工业用原材料、专用机床、工具磨具等等的生产都作了全面的安排，并已取得了很大的成绩。为了更好地支援轴承工业，最好能进一步规定定点供应，根据当前需要和发展远景，统一作系统性的安排，为确保轴承工业的当前任务和合理发展打下可靠的物质基础。
    （二）加快建设我国轴承工业的骨干企业
     在社会主义建设飞跃发展中，各方面对轴承的需要成倍增长，这就给轴承工业带来了非常艰巨而光荣的任务，在轴承工业的发展方面，新厂建设与老厂扩建都有着不同的作用。加速扩建老厂，投资少，效果快，但是考虑到长远打算，使整个轴承工业在最经济合理的基础上发展，就有赖于早日建立新的轴承厂，好处是新厂从无到有、可以充分利用老厂技术革命的成果，可以加强专业化，品种类型单纯一些，在中央支援地方，老厂包干负责支援新厂的方针下，新厂可以迅速壮大，二三年内就可以达到设计水平成为新生骨干企业，以满足国民经济飞跃发展中各方面对轴承的需要。
    为了配合轴承工业的继续跃进，在适当省市中心成立轴承修理厂，有极大的经济价值。修理轴承、套圈不需新的毛坯，钢球由大改小，仍可应用，仅需补充一部分钢球及更换保持架，如果使用及维护合理，及时更换，一般轴承可以修理两次到三次仍可维持标准级精度，鉴于我国各方面采用轴承数量极大，修理轴承非但可以为国家创造大量财富，亦有很大现实意义。
    （三）发展新品种，控制非标准品种
    在国民经济发展中，各方面都有重大精尖新产品，因此对轴承工业也提出了多种多样的新品种要求，这种要求是合理的，必须加以满足。但是也有这样情况，在设计时没有考虑尽量采用标准型号轴承的因素，这样就增加了轴承企业的生产品种，对进一步提高生产能力是不利的，因此对非标准轴承新品种的发展，加以合理的控制是当前一个很重要的任务。与此同时对轴承的合理安装、使用、维护等方面，加强技术指导，亦可以有效地延长各企业轴承使用寿命。
    （四）加强协作，发展新技术
    在一九五八年大跃进中，轴承工业开展了轰轰烈烈的群众性技术革新和技术革命运动，目前正在不断形成新的高潮，广大职工在总路线的光辉照耀下，树立了敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，提出了许多新的技术革新方向，对今后轴承工业的发展有着十分重大的意义和深远的影响。目前有许多高等学校、科学研究单位已和轴承厂密切配合，发展新技术，取得了很大的成绩，充分体现了中央“科学研究、教学与生产相结合”方针的正确性。在改进轴承套圈毛胚方面，试验成功了冲压、挤压、热正形等新工艺，并拟进一步利用管料切环成形碾压，逐步向精密锻造方向发展，材料利用率可以提高到百分之六十至百分之七十，普遍实现推广，每年可为国家节省优质合金钢几万吨，同时精锻后毛坯几何精度很高，基本上接近取消车削加工，从而可以大量节省车工机床、刀具及电力消耗。在生产自动化方面，在旧有机床上加装自动化装置，各厂都取得了许多经验，比如哈尔滨轴承厂和哈尔滨工业大学密切合作，已设计完成了一系列的精密、简化、高效率轴承工业专用全自动机床，第一种已试制成功，性能良好产量提高一倍，可以普遍推广。加强协作，组织有关机床厂及科研单位，围绕轴承工业发展精密锻造及自动化等新技术，非但对轴承工业，工艺水平及生产能力有空前的提高，而且相应的大大减轻了冶金工业和机床工业的负担，相信在党的正确领导下，一定能迅速取得光辉的成就。
    （五）加强新生技术力量的培训工作
    轴承工业是一个新兴工业，由于发展速度快，因此各轴承厂和轴承研究所的技术力量就显得薄弱和担负的任务有些不相适应，在一九五八年各轴承厂大力开展群众性的文化革命来配合技术革命的高潮，已取得了显著的成绩，职工文化技术水平有了很大的提高，为了加速中高级技术人员的培养，最好在高等学校和中技校中设立一些轴承专业的课程，或是专开几班轴承专业班，由轴承厂和研究所提供技术资料作为教材，并提供学生实际操作等培训的便利条件，使新生技术力量得以迅速成长，以满足飞跃发展中轴承工业的需要。
    以上几点意见很不成熟，请大会批评指正。
    最后祝大会胜利成功，各位委员身体健康。
