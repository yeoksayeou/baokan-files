    She Found a Standard Pronunciation Teacher
    Chen Yingjing, a female member of the Communist Youth League from Guiyu People's Commune, Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province, was extremely happy to participate in the "Hanyu Pinyin Scheme" study class for primary school teachers in her township.
    At first, "listening to the lessons was like a duck listening to thunder," and she couldn't understand much of what the teacher said. Difficulties kept arising, but they couldn't shake her confidence in learning. While others took breaks after class, she was busy asking the teacher questions, asking incessantly. In class, she listened with extra care, watching the teacher's mouth shape and memorizing the pronunciation points; when practicing pronunciation at home, she used a mirror to check her mouth shape and tongue position. She practiced the difficult sounds again and again, some even hundreds of times. After three and a half days (twelve hours of class), she basically mastered the skills of reading, writing, and spelling in the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet.
    After returning to her village, Chen Yingjing often persisted in self-study. She read aloud materials with Pinyin letters added, and if she didn't understand, she looked up the words in the dictionary, spelling them out one by one, learning sentence by sentence. Usually, at home, she read newspapers and books when she got them; on the road, she looked up unfamiliar characters on slogans in the dictionary; when listening to others speak, she also looked up unfamiliar words in the Pinyin dictionary. She said, "The Pinyin alphabet is really good, it's my standard pronunciation teacher; the Pinyin dictionary is my good friend."
    Now Chen Yingjing can correctly pronounce all the initials, finals, and tones in standard Mandarin; she can spell, and can add Pinyin letters to Chinese characters according to her literacy level. Recently, the township invited her to serve as a teacher in a community-run primary school. (Guo Jian)

    她找到了正音教师
    广东省潮阳县贵屿人民公社女共青团员陈映菁，参加了乡里的小学教师“汉语拼音方案”学习班，高兴极了。
    开始时，“听课像鸭子听雷轰”，教师讲的很多东西她都听不懂。困难不断出现，但都动摇不了她的学习信心。别人下课休息，她忙于请教教师，问个不停。上课时她加倍用心听，看教师的口形，记住发音要领；回家练习发音时，拿镜子检查口形、舌位。难读的音练习再练习，有的甚至练习上百次。经过三天半（上课十二小时），她就基本掌握了汉语拼音字母的读、写和拼音等技能。
    陈映菁回村后，经常坚持自学。她朗读加注了拼音字母的读物，不懂就查字典，一个个拼，一句句学。平时她在家拿到报纸、书本就念；在路上走，看到标语上的生字就翻字典；听别人讲话，有听不懂的字，也查拼音字典。她说：“拼音字母真好，是我的正音教师；拼音字典是我的好朋友。”
    现在陈映菁已经会正确地念出普通话的全部声、韵、调；会拼读、拼写，能根据自己的识字水平给汉字注上拼音字母。最近，乡里请她担任了民办小学教师。　（郭坚）
