Comrades Representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li and Vice Chairman Peng. We must, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, exert our utmost efforts to make this year's Great Leap Forward even better.

    Bringing Water Uphill to Overcome Drought and Develop Production

Dongliang Mountain in Wushan County, Gansu Province, used to be extremely arid, and the masses lived a very hard life. In 1956, in order to eliminate drought and develop production, we planned to bring water up the mountain. At that time, many people did not believe it, and some even made strange remarks: "If you want water to go up the mountain, unless the winding shaft grows vines, the horse grows horns, and the crow grows red ears." We did not lose heart. Everyone came up with ideas and methods, relying on collective strength, and finally built the Dongliang Canal and brought water to the mountain. The people of the whole province praised us as the banner of bringing water to the mountain. In fact, if it were not for the leadership of the Party, how could water have gone up the mountain?

How to irrigate in mountainous areas is another new problem. Some people say, "It's easy to go up the mountain, but difficult to irrigate." After two years of exploration, we have found the following methods:

First, strengthen the canal body and maintain the canal. This is the most important measure to ensure safe water flow. We have established a year-round infrastructure team on the canal, contracted by area and section, with dedicated personnel responsible for implementing three guarantees (guarantee repair, guarantee maintenance, guarantee patrol) and four packages (canal package consolidation, tree package survival, road package leveling, water package timely addition and removal). We planted 150,000 apple trees, 500,000 mulberry trees, 300,000 walnut trees, 70,000 grapevines, 90,000 pepper trees, 150,000 peach and apricot trees on both sides of the canal, and also used sod and stone dry masonry, red clay anti-seepage, sod to protect the canal, etc., to prevent collapse, seepage, cracking, and scouring, and improve the quality of the canal, achieving constant water flow in the upper reaches, clear water in the middle reaches, and no water leakage in the fields. We have also established a communication network along the canal, using flag signals, traffic lights, and telephones to communicate information and prevent accidents.

Second, combine "diversion, storage, and use" to make the canal network reservoir-like. We have already built 314 branch canals, 75 reservoirs, and 71 pond-connected cellars, and are building a general reservoir at the water inlet. In this way, the Dongliang Canal has begun to form a mountainous irrigation network of "forest connected to river, river connected to reservoir, reservoir connected to canal, canal connected to pond, pond connected to cellar, cellar package mu." Canals deliver water, ponds and cellars store water, and irrigation is carried out by pond package mu, by area. Store when idle, irrigate when needed; store when it rains, irrigate when it is sunny; store at night, irrigate during the day. The water source is guaranteed, and irrigation is more reasonable.

Third, level the land and build terraced fields. This is an important way to completely solve the irrigation problem in mountainous areas. Now we have transformed 30% of the mountain slopes into terraced fields, and the rest of the land has also been leveled to reduce the slope. Before the slopes are completely transformed into terraced fields, we have ranked the land according to the size of the slope, and planted different crops on land with different slopes, using different irrigation methods. In our area, slopes below 10 degrees are planted with densely planted crops such as wheat and millet, and irrigated with herringbone, one-word dam, inverted figure eight, and oblique ridge dam methods; slopes above 10 degrees are planted with relatively sparse crops such as corn, sorghum, and potatoes, and irrigated with ditch irrigation, string heaps, panlong irrigation, and fish scale pits. At the top of the mountain where water cannot flow, the siphon pipe is installed by using the terrain drop to improve the water level for irrigation. At the same time, we also use high-level ditching, low-level damming, small ridge live embankment, multiple openings, and small water volume to disperse runoff, reduce scouring, and increase the soil's ability to absorb water. In addition, we have also built some underground pipelines and manufactured more than 500 sets of artificial rainmakers, which can reduce evaporation, save water, and wash away the dust on crops to promote their growth.

    Mountains and Rivers are Beautiful and Landscaped, the Scenery is More Beautiful than Southern China
    Old People Laugh Happily and Girls Compete to Go Up the Mountain

Now, the face of Dongliang Mountain has changed greatly. The grain yield per mu in 1958 increased by 100% compared with 1957, and increased by five times compared with before liberation. Hemp and rice, which could not be grown in the past, can now be grown. There are hydropower stations on the mountain, electric lights have been lit, and small factories such as flour processing plants and flax processing plants have been established. There are primary schools, health stations, health centers, and supply and marketing cooperatives. All of these were not available in the past. Many girls from the plain areas have also married into Dongliang Mountain. People's lives are getting better and better. The so-called "poor North Mountain, rich South Mountain, the most bitter is the edge of East Liang, carrying water and grinding flour have to go down the mountain, no girls marry Baijia Mountain" has forever become a thing of the past.

What we have done now is very little, just a beginning, and more things are waiting for us to do. We plan to realize four networks and sixizations on Dongliang Mountain in a few years, namely: irrigation network, power network, transportation network, field protection forest belt network; advanced mountain water conservancy, electrified irrigation, industrialized canals (using water power to run small factories, and using the income of the factories to maintain the canals), afforestation of barren mountains and slopes, terracing of mountain land, and beautification of villages and roads. At that time, Dongliang Mountain will become more beautiful, just as the masses sing: "Dongliang Mountain, Dongliang Mountain, bitter drought turns into a water area; steep mountain slopes become terraced fields, piece by piece are all gardens and fields; the irrigation system is self-flowing, factories have everything from fish to rice; every household has tap water, iron cattle and electric plows come to cultivate the land; mountains and rivers are beautiful and landscaped, the scenery is more beautiful than Southern China; old people laugh happily, and girls compete to go up the mountain; the leadership of the Communist Party is good, and the happy life lasts forever."

Our Wushan County has more mountains than plains, and the drought is relatively serious. Now, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole county are exerting their utmost efforts to build in the direction of Dongliang Mountain, striving to change the arid face of the mountainous areas as soon as possible.

When the people of the whole country are making great leaps forward and accelerating the construction of a happy socialist society, the Tibetan reactionary elements who are used to drinking human blood are engaged in armed rebellion, making trouble for "Tibetan independence," and want to sell the territory of the motherland, Tibet, to foreign countries, which we will never tolerate. I fully support the central government's policy. We must completely quell the Tibetan rebellion and smash the conspiracy of foreign invaders and Tibetan rebellious elements. The Chinese people have always been able to say what they mean and do what they say!

If what I said is not correct, please criticize me, comrades representatives.

### 马并未生角　水却上了山  汪德昌代表的发言

    马并未生角　水却上了山
    汪德昌代表的发言各位代表：
    听了周总理的政府工作报告，两位李副总理和彭副委员长的报告，我完全拥护。我们一定要在党和毛主席的领导下，鼓足干劲，把今年的大跃进搞得更好。
    引水上山战胜干旱发展生产
    我们甘肃省武山县的东梁山，过去是最干旱不过了，群众生活苦得很。一九五六年，我们为了消灭干旱，发展生产，计划引水上山。当时很多人不相信，有的还说怪话：“若要水上山，除非辘轴生蔓马生角，乌鸦长出红耳朵”。我们没有泄气，大家出主意，想办法，依靠集体力量，到底修成了东梁渠，把水引到了山上。全省人民夸奖我们是引水上山的旗帜，其实，要不是党的领导，水那里能够上得了山呢？
    山区怎样灌溉，这又是个新问题。有人说“上山容易灌溉难”。经过这两年的摸索，我们找到了这样几条办法：
    第一条，加固渠身，养护渠道。这是保证安全通水最关紧要的措施。我们在渠上建立了常年基建队，分片分段包干，专人负责，实行三保（保修、保养、保巡），四包（渠包固、树包活、路包平、水包及时加退）。在渠道两岸种了十五万株苹果，五十万株桑树，三十万株核桃，七万株葡萄，九万株花椒，十五万株桃树和杏树，还用草皮石头干砌法、红粘土制渗法、草皮护渠法等等，防止了坍方、渗漏、裂缝、冲刷，提高了渠道的质量，做到了上游常通水，中游通清水，田间不跑水。我们还在沿渠建立了通讯联络网，利用旗语、红绿灯和电话，互通情报，防止意外事故。
    第二条，“引、蓄、用”三结合，渠网库塘化。我们已经修了三百十四条支渠，七十五座蓄水塘，七十一个塘连窖，并且正在进水口修建一个总水库。这样，东梁渠就开始形成一个“林连河，河连库，库连渠，渠连塘，塘连窖，窖包亩”的山区灌溉网。渠道送水，塘窖蓄水，按塘包亩，分片灌溉。闲时蓄，用时灌；雨时蓄，晴时灌；夜间蓄，白天灌。水源有了保证，灌溉也更合理。
    第三条，平整土地，修建梯田。这是彻底解决山区灌溉问题的一条重要办法。现在我们已经把百分之三十的山坡地修成了梯田，其余的土地也进行了平整，减小了坡度。在坡地没有完全修成梯田以前，我们按坡度的大小，进行了土地排队，在不同坡度的土地上，种不同的作物，用不同的灌溉方法。在我们那里，十度以下的坡地种小麦，糜谷等密植作物，用人字形、一字挡、倒八字、斜畦挡等方法灌溉；十度以上的坡地，种玉米、高粱、洋芋等比较稀疏的作物，用沟灌、串堆子、盘龙灌溉、鱼鳞坑等方法灌溉。在水流不到的山尖上，利用地形落差，安装倒虹吸管，提高水位的方法灌溉。同时，我们还用高处开沟，低处打挡，小畦活埂，多开口，水量小的方法，分散径流，减少冲刷，增加土壤吸收水分的能力。此外，我们还修了一部分地下管道，自己制造了五百多套人工降雨器，既能减少蒸发，节省用水，又能洗净作物上的尘土，促进他们成长。
    山清水秀园林化风光美丽赛江南
    老人乐得哈哈笑姑娘争着要上山
    现在，东梁山上的面貌已经起了很大的变化。一九五八年的粮食亩产，比一九五七年增加了一倍，比解放前增加了五倍。过去不能种的大麻、水稻，现在也能种了。山上有了水电站，点上了电灯，还办了面粉加工厂、亚麻加工厂等小型工厂。小学、卫生站、保健站、供销站样样都有了。所有这些，过去是一样也没有的。不少的川区姑娘，也嫁到了东梁山。人民的生活一天天好起来。所谓“穷北山，富南山，焦苦不过东梁边，担水磨面要下山，有女不嫁柏家山”，已经永远成为过去的事情了。
    我们现在做到的事情还很少，只不过是一个开始，更多的事情在等着我们去做。我们计划在几年内，在东梁山上实现四网、六化，这就是：灌溉网，电力网，交通运输网，护田林带网；山地水利高级化，灌溉电气化，渠道工厂化（利用水的动力办小型工厂，用工厂的收入来养护渠道），荒山荒坡绿化，山地梯田化，村庄道路美化。那时候，东梁山将要变得更加美丽，正像群众歌唱的一样：“东梁山，东梁山，焦苦干旱变水川；山坡陡地变梯田，片片块块尽园田；灌溉系统自流化，工厂鱼米样样全；家家安上自来水，铁牛电犁来耕地；山清水秀园林化，风光美丽赛江南；老人乐得哈哈笑，姑娘争着要上山；共产党的领导好，幸福生活万万年。”
    我们武山县是个山地多于川地的地方，干旱比较严重。现在，全县人民在党的领导下正鼓足干劲，朝着东梁山的方向努力建设，争取早日改变山区的干旱面貌。
    当全国人民都在大跃进，加紧建设幸福的社会主义社会的时候，那些喝惯了人血的西藏反动分子却在搞武装叛乱，闹“西藏独立”，想把祖国的领土西藏出卖给外国，这是我们万万不能容忍的。我完全拥护中央的方针。我们一定要彻底平息西藏叛乱，一定要把外国侵略者和西藏叛乱分子的阴谋打得粉碎。我们中国人民向来就是说得到，就做得到！
    我讲得不对的地方，请各位代表批评。
