In the summer of 1955, Tibetan traitors, including So Kon Wangqing Gele and Chijiang Luosang Yixi, incited and directed reactionary elements to rebel along the way when they returned to Tibet via Sichuan after attending the National People's Congress with the Dalai Lama. Since then, rebellions have occurred in these areas one after another, and the Litang Lama Temple where Chijiang lived and the Ganzi Dajin Temple where So Kon lived have become the first temples to launch rebellions and the center of the rebellion.

The so-called "Khampa Rebellion" (Khampa is a Tibetan word referring to the Tibetan area in eastern Kham and the Tibetan areas of Ganzi in Sichuan) was provoked by a small number of reactionary slave owners and feudal lords in this area who coerced some of the masses in order to maintain their dark rule. They burned, killed, robbed, and plundered, doing everything possible to seriously endanger the lives and property of the local Tibetan people. These inhuman rebels were acting under the orders of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group. (Pictures attached)

Top Left: The Khampa rebels used the skulls of the people they killed, inlaid with silver, to make various utensils. It is hard to believe that these acts were done by humans.

Top Right: These are the various instruments of torture used by the Khampa rebels to gouge out eyes, cut off noses and mouths, and sever tendons. According to statistics from some townships in Xinlong County, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, as many as 138 people had their eyes gouged out, noses cut off, and tendons severed by the rebels.

Bottom Left: This innocent Tibetan compatriot had both eyes gouged out by the Khampa rebels, leaving him permanently disabled.

Bottom Center: This Tibetan woman was raped by the Khampa rebels. She is tearfully denouncing the towering crimes of the Khampa rebels.

Bottom Right: This is an intact human skin, peeled from a Tibetan child by the rebels in Ganzi County. (Xinhua News Agency manuscript)

    康巴叛乱分子的罪行
    1955年夏天，西藏叛国分子索康·旺清格勒、赤江·罗桑益西等随达赖喇嘛出席全国人民代表大会完毕返藏经四川时，沿途煽动和指使反动分子叛乱。在这以后，这些地区就先后发生叛乱活动，而赤江住过的理塘喇嘛寺和索康住过的甘孜大金寺，都成为首先发起叛乱的寺庙和叛乱的中心。
    所谓“康巴叛乱”（康巴是藏语，指康藏高原东部、四川甘孜一带藏族地区）是这个地区的少数反动的奴隶主、封建主为了保持他们黑暗统治，而胁迫部分群众挑起的。他们烧、杀、抢、掠，无所不为，严重地危害了当地藏族人民生命财产的安全。而这些灭绝人性的叛乱分子，正是听命于西藏上层反动集团的。（附图片）
    上左：康巴叛乱分子用他们杀害了的人头骨镶上银边来做成各种用具。人们很难相信这些行为竟是人干出来的。
    上右：这就是康巴叛乱分子经常使用的挖眼睛、割口鼻、抽脚筋用的各种刑具。据甘孜藏族自治州新龙县部分乡的统计，被叛乱分子挖眼睛、割鼻子、抽脚筋的就有一百三十八人之多。
    下左：这个无辜的藏胞被康巴叛乱分子挖去了双眼，成了终身残废。
    下中：这个藏族妇女被康巴叛乱分子奸污了。她含着眼泪在控诉康巴叛乱分子的滔天罪行。
    下右：这是一张完整的人皮，是甘孜县城区的叛乱分子从一个藏族小孩身上剥下来的。　（新华社稿）
