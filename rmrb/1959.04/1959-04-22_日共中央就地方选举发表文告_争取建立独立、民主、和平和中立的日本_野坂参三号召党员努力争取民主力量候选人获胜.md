Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party Central Committee’s Presidium published a statement in the "Akahata" newspaper on the 14th regarding the upcoming local elections, calling on party organizations and all party members to unite firmly around the Party Central Committee, adhere to the party's principled stance, resolutely crush the Liberal Democratic Party's conspiracy, and fight for the establishment of an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan.

The statement condemned the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party for carrying out extremely malicious anti-communist propaganda on a large scale as the local elections approached, plotting to forcibly revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," adhering to a policy of hostility towards China, and undermining the united struggle of democratic forces.

The statement pointed out that under these circumstances, the party's tasks are very important. At present, the objective situation at home and abroad is basically conducive to the development of patriotic and democratic forces in Japan. The attacks by the ruling classes of the United States and Japan on democratic forces do not indicate their strength; on the contrary, they show that they are struggling to the death in the face of powerful popular forces.

The statement called on party organizations and all party members to concentrate their efforts to crush the enemy's offensive in accordance with the decisions and policies of the Party Central Committee.

In its statement, the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party called on all party members to further develop the struggle to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in accordance with the urgent demands of the Japanese people, and to hold high the banner of "peace" and "national independence," inherit and develop the party's tradition, and fight to the end against U.S. imperialism's control of Japan. The statement pointed out that this struggle is of great importance to the future of the Japanese nation and is also the key to determining the success or failure of the upcoming local elections. The statement also called on party organizations and all party members to actively strive to strengthen and expand the party's strength in the election struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 21st: Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzō Nosaka published a written statement in the "Akahata" newspaper today, calling on all members of the Japanese Communist Party to redouble their efforts to win the victory of the Communist Party candidates and the united candidates of the democratic forces as the local elections draw nearer.

Nosaka pointed out that the victory and the gaining of more votes for the JCP candidates and the unified candidates of democratic forces in the gubernatorial and mayoral elections is of great significance for crushing the Liberal Democratic Party's traitorous and corrupt politics and for establishing a united front led by the Communist Party and the working class.

Nosaka said that Communists must also strive to increase the number of Communist Party seats in local assemblies.

Nosaka called on Communists to actively publicize the party's policies, concentrate on supporting the Communist Party and the democratic forces' candidates who are likely to be elected, and be vigilant and expose the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's sabotage activities against the JCP and its despicable behavior of buying votes.

Sanzō Nosaka also spoke about the international situation in his statement. He said that the current characteristic of the international situation is that the forces of socialism, the forces fighting for national independence, and the forces of peace are growing stronger day by day; while imperialism's policies of aggression and war are running into snags everywhere and are facing increasing difficulties.

    日共中央就地方选举发表文告
    争取建立独立、民主、和平和中立的日本
    野坂参三号召党员努力争取民主力量候选人获胜
    新华社讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会14日在“赤旗报”上就即将举行的地方选举发表文告，号召党的组织和全体党员坚强地团结在党中央的周围，坚持党的原则立场，为彻底粉碎自由民主党的阴谋，并且为争取建立独立、民主、和平、中立的日本而斗争。
    文告谴责岸信介内阁和自由民主党在地方选举即将举行的时候，大肆进行极其恶劣的反共宣传，阴谋强行修改日美“安全条约”，坚持敌视中国的政策，并且破坏民主力量的联合斗争。
    文告指出，在这种形势下，党的任务是很重大的。目前，日本国内外的客观形势基本上有利于日本爱国民主力量的发展，美国和日本的统治阶级对民主力量的攻击并不表明它们的坚强，相反地却表明它们在强大的人民力量面前正在进行垂死的挣扎。
    文告号召党组织和全体党员根据党中央的决定和方针，集中力量来粉碎敌人的进攻。
    日本共产党中央在文告中号召全体党员根据日本人民的迫切要求，进一步展开阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的斗争，并且高举“和平”与“民族独立”的旗帜，继承和发展党的传统，为反对美帝国主义对日本的控制而斗争到底。文告指出，这一斗争同日本民族的未来有重大关系，同时也是决定即将举行的地方选举的胜败的关键。文告还号召党的组织和全体党员在竞选斗争中积极为加强和扩大党的力量而努力。
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三今天在“赤旗报”上发表书面谈话，号召日本共产党全体党员在地方选举投票日益临近的时候，为争取共产党候选人和民主力量统一候选人的胜利而加倍努力。
    野坂指出，在知事和市长选举中，使日共候选人、民主力量统一候选人获得胜利和获得更多的选票，对于粉碎自由民主党卖国、贪污的政治和对建立以共产党、工人阶级为领导力量的统一战线具有重大意义。
    野坂说，共产党员还必须努力争取增加共产党在地方议会中的席位。
    野坂号召共产党员积极宣传党的政策，集中力量支持共产党和民主力量的有希望当选的候选人，并且警惕和揭露岸信介内阁对日共的破坏活动和收买选票等卑劣行为。
    野坂参三在谈话中还谈到了国际形势。他说，目前国际形势的特点是，社会主义力量、争取民族独立的力量以及和平力量正在日益壮大；而帝国主义的侵略和战争政策则在到处碰壁，困难日益加深。
