Comrade Chairman and fellow delegates:
    I fully agree with Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and the work reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, as well as Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and resolutely support all measures taken by the Central People's Government to quell the rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, to safeguard the unity of the motherland and national unity.
    In order to safeguard the unity and solidarity of the motherland, we firmly oppose the collusion of British imperialists and Indian expansionists in interfering in our internal affairs.
    Fujian is located at the front line of national defense. The entire army and people have always shouldered the dual tasks of liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, and socialist construction. In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line and driven by patriotism against the war threats of US imperialism, the struggle against the enemy and the march towards nature merged into a torrent. The whole people were full of vigor and enthusiasm, overcoming numerous difficulties and achieving great victories in the struggle against the enemy and in production and construction.
    The People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front, with the strong support of the people of Fujian, severely attacked the Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched in Jinmen, achieving brilliant results and crushing the military provocations of US imperialism.
    Imperialism is a teacher by negative example. We, the people of Fujian, have a particularly deep understanding of this. In July and August last year, US imperialism, in defiance of the opposition of the people of the world, gathered a large number of military forces, deployed troops in the Taiwan Strait, carried out military provocations and war threats against our country, and instigated the Chiang Kai-shek clique to harass and sabotage our mainland. US imperialism thought that armed threats could scare the Chinese people, but the facts went against the wishes of the imperialists. The Chinese people who have stood up cannot be intimidated. Fujian, like all parts of the country, quickly rolled up a wave of anti-aggression anger. In the face of the invaders, the people were high in morale and soaring in enthusiasm, taking up the hoe in one hand and the gun in the other. In just over ten days, they developed and strengthened a team of more than two million backbone militiamen.
    The People's Liberation Army stationed in our province carried out punitive strikes against the Chiang Kai-shek army entrenched in Jinmen, severely damaging the enemy's navy, army, and air force, achieving brilliant results, and placing the enemy in a shameful military defeat, completely in a passive and beaten position; it smashed the military provocations of US imperialism and disrupted its aggressive plans. Politically, because US imperialism created a war crisis in the Taiwan Strait and repeatedly violated our coastal airspace, directly escorting the Chiang army, it thoroughly exposed its hideous face as an aggressor in front of the people of the world, and suffered strong condemnation from all peace-loving people and countries in the world, placing it in unprecedented isolation. The noose around the neck of the US imperialist aggressor is getting tighter and tighter. The predicament of being in a dilemma has further deepened the contradictions between imperialisms and between the US and Chiang, exposing the paper tiger nature of imperialism, which is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, once again vividly and profoundly proving Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," further encouraging the confidence and determination of the people of the world to fight against imperialism, defend peace, and strive for national independence.
    The victory of the front-line war was achieved through the heroic fighting and arduous struggle of the People's Liberation Army, but it is also inseparable from the support and direct participation of the people. In the war, the militia of Fujian was the backbone of supporting the front and a capable assistant to the troops. The militia on the front-line positions directly engaged in combat, building fortifications, transporting ammunition, standing guard, rescuing the wounded, and doing everything; they could not only throw grenades and use rifles, but also learned to load cannons and fire cannons, becoming all-round gunners. For the sake of victory, the people of Fujian vigorously supported the front from all aspects and positions. From children wearing red scarves to white-haired old people, everyone regarded it as the greatest glory of their lives to be able to contribute to the victory of the war. They worked day and night, regardless of wind and rain, and regardless of the flying shells, throwing themselves into the struggle against the enemy and supporting the front with the greatest enthusiasm, displaying unparalleled heroism and selfless revolutionary spirit. When the troops needed labor, a large number of outstanding young and middle-aged people rushed to the front to help the troops repair roads and fortifications, and transport military supplies. Thousands upon thousands of boxes of ammunition, thousands upon thousands of pieces of timber, and thousands upon thousands of cubic meters of stone were transported to the positions through their hands, enabling the front-line troops to successfully carry out their combat missions; when the troops needed to consolidate fortifications, the masses sent all suitable materials to the front. Facing Yangtang Village in Jinmen, more than twenty households personally dismantled their houses and donated the stone to the troops. They said: "Houses are valuable, but the People's Liberation Army is even more valuable." In order to make the troops live better, the people braved the artillery fire and set up "logistics departments," "front-line restaurants," "savings and exchange offices," "mobile postmen," "barber shops," "laundry groups," etc. on the positions, serving the troops in all aspects. This is how the people loved and cared for their own soldiers.
    In the heat of the struggle, countless moving heroic deeds and heroic figures emerged, such as "Little Eighth Route Army Soldiers," "Ten Sisters on the Front Line," "Five Girls," "Eighteen Heroes," and "Twenty-three Warriors." Twelve-year-old He Danian and four other children often braved the artillery fire and secretly shuttled through the positions to repair the telephone lines that had been cut off. Such moving heroic deeds and heroic figures are too numerous to mention. The people of the Xiamen front once praised in poetry:
      Xiamen, heroic island, its heroic name resounds throughout the world,
      Alert Little Eighth Route Army Soldiers, resilient Five Girls,
      Harvesting crops under the shells, delivering water to the front lines,
      The army and the people as one, the might of the sea frontier is awe-inspiring.
    While winning the struggle against the enemy, Fujian's socialist construction has also seen a great leap forward. The total grain output has doubled compared with 1957, achieving the target of becoming a "thousand-jin province" ahead of schedule. Industry has also set off a high tide of mass steelmaking, ending the history of Fujian Province being "without an ounce of steel."
    In 1958, we not only achieved victory in the struggle against the enemy, but also saw a comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction. That is: the total grain output doubled compared with 1957, achieving the target of becoming a "thousand-jin province" ahead of schedule, ending the history of our province's reliance on support from other places for grain; the output of peanuts and the area of afforestation have both increased many times; other various cash crops, fisheries, salt industry, and animal husbandry have also seen great development. In industry, a high tide of mass industry and mass steelmaking was set off, with small-scale industries blooming everywhere, and the total industrial output value increased by 78 percent; the state's steel production tasks assigned to our province were completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, ending the history of our province being "without an ounce of steel." With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, transportation, culture, education, health and other undertakings have also seen great development. The province's railway transportation mileage reached 829 kilometers, and the construction of highways increased fourfold, initially forming a convenient transportation network with railways as the center, further changing the inconvenient transportation situation in our province; primary school education has been popularized throughout the province, and work-study programs have been launched, further eliminating illiteracy and promoting Putonghua; schistosomiasis has been basically eliminated throughout the province, and the prevention and treatment of other diseases has also been further strengthened.
    These great achievements were achieved through arduous struggle in a situation where the task of fighting against the enemy was very heavy. In the days of intense fighting, the people of the province made ambitious goals for socialist production and construction, proposing heroic slogans such as "Striving for high-yield records in battle is the hero of heroes" and "Drowning the aggressors with molten iron and burying the wolves with a sea of grain." It is especially worth pointing out that the people in the front-line areas, under the severe destruction and threat of enemy artillery fire, adhered to production and construction tenaciously, working hard with small-scale efforts, and expanding with large-scale efforts, working during the day and at night, working here and there, according to the patterns of enemy shelling. Crops were destroyed by artillery fire, so they immediately filled the shell holes and replanted; oyster stones in shallow waters were shelled, so they were moved to deep waters for production; fishing nets and gear were damaged, so they were quickly repaired and the sails were raised again to go out to sea for fishing. The front-line people's commune in Xiamen once created a high-yield record of 3,000 jin per mu for oyster meat, and the rice yield also increased by 80 percent compared with 1957, and they used the shrapnel sent by the enemy as raw materials for steelmaking, winning the steelmaking championship in Xiamen City. The heroic people thus created miracles in production and construction in the struggle against the enemy.
    Our People's Liberation Army has adhered to and carried forward the glorious tradition of being both a fighting force and a working force, both a defender of socialism and a builder of socialism. On the one hand, they fought heroically to defend production and construction; on the other hand, they actively participated in the socialist construction of coastal islands and urban and rural areas in the province, just like building their own hometown. From January to November last year alone, the army supported local construction with more than 3 million workdays, creating a lot of wealth.
    Facts have proved that the more resolutely we struggle against imperialism, the more we can educate the masses and mobilize the masses to carry out socialist construction quickly and efficiently; and the more and faster we build, the more power we have to support the front. The anti-imperialist struggle has played a great role in mobilizing and educating the people, and it has further mobilized the production enthusiasm of the people throughout the province. Every victory on the front encourages the people of the province to work harder in production and construction; and the great leap forward in production and construction, and the good news of the bumper harvests of steel, grain, and wood, in turn encourage the three armed forces on the front to strive for greater victories in battle. A folk song sings well:
      The red sun shines on the hillside, thousands of cannons sing together,
      News of victory is sent with the wind, and steel and grain production increases in the rear;
      The red sun shines on the hillside, workers and peasants sing the leap forward song together,
      Good news of the leap forward is sent to the front, and soldiers make more contributions to defend the country.
    The two major victories in the struggle against the enemy and production and construction on the Fujian front were achieved under the wise leadership of the Party and the Central People's Government and with the support of the people of the whole country. Now the people of Fujian continue to exert their utmost efforts, aim high, and strive to complete the tasks of industrial and agricultural production and consolidate national defense.
    The communist great collaboration between the front and the rear, the army and the people, fighting side by side and working together, has guaranteed the two major victories in the struggle against the enemy and production and construction. This victory is great, comprehensive, and unprecedented. This victory is the victory of the Party's General Line for building socialism, and the victory of Chairman Mao's military thought. This victory was achieved under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, and it is also inseparable from the strong support of the people of the whole country. We must not forget that in the difficult days of our struggle against the enemy, in addition to giving us strong support in terms of materials, the people of the whole country also sent condolence groups, traveling thousands of miles, to the Fujian front to express their condolences, which greatly encouraged the fighting spirit and enthusiasm of the army and people in our province. Here, on behalf of the army and people of Fujian Province, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the people of all parts of the country.
    In 1959, on the basis of the victory in 1958, under the leadership of the Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, we must unite all forces that can be united, mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized, continue to exert our utmost efforts, aim high, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in production and construction in 1959, to continue to consolidate national defense, drive the aggressive forces of US imperialism out of the Taiwan Strait, and defend the peaceful construction of the motherland and world peace!

专栏：

    前线斗争的胜利和生产建设的胜利
    江一真代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春、李先念副总理以及彭真副委员长所做的各项工作报告，并坚决拥护中央人民政府下令平定原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的叛乱，维护祖国统一和民族团结所采取的一切措施。
    为了维护祖国的统一和团结，我们坚决反对英帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子狼狈为奸地干涉我国内政。
    福建地处国防前线，全体军民历来就肩负着解放台、澎、金、马和社会主义建设的双重任务。一九五八年，我省在党的总路线光辉照耀下，在反对美帝战争威胁的爱国主义推动下，对敌斗争和向自然进军汇成一股洪流，全民意气风发，热情奔放，战胜了重重困难，取得了对敌斗争和生产建设的伟大胜利。
    福建前线人民解放军，在福建人民有力的支援下，痛击盘距金门蒋匪军，取得了辉煌的战果，并粉碎了美帝国主义的军事挑衅
    帝国主义是反面教员。这一点，我们福建人民体会得特别深刻。去年七、八月间，美帝国主义悍然不顾世界人民的反对，集结了大批军事力量，陈兵台湾海峡，对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，并策动蒋介石集团对我大陆进行骚扰破坏。美帝国主义以为用武装威胁就可以吓倒中国人民，但事实走向了帝国主义者愿望的反面，站起来了的中国人民是吓不倒的，福建同全国各地一样，迅速地卷起了一个反侵略的怒潮。在侵略者面前，人民斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，一手拿锄，一手拿枪，在短短的十几天内，就发展壮大一支拥有二百多万基干民兵的队伍。
    解放军驻我省部队，对盘踞在金门的蒋军进行了惩罚性的打击，痛创了敌人的海、陆、空军，取得了辉煌的战果，使敌人在军事上遭到了可耻的失败，完全处于被动挨打的境地；粉碎了美帝国主义的军事挑衅，打乱了它的侵略计划。在政治上，由于美帝国主义在台湾海峡制造战争危机，多次侵犯我沿海领空，直接为蒋军护航，这就在全世界人民面前彻底地暴露出侵略者的狰狞面目，遭受到全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家的强烈谴责，使它陷于空前的孤立，套在美帝侵略者脖子上的绞索越来越紧。处于进退两难的窘境，这就进一步加深了帝国主义之间、美蒋之间的矛盾，暴露了帝国主义外强中干、虚有其表的纸老虎的原形，再一次生动地深刻地证明了毛主席的“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断，更加鼓舞了全世界人民反对帝国主义、保卫和平、争取民族独立斗争的信心和决心。
    前线战争的胜利，是人民解放军的英勇善战和艰苦奋斗得来的，但它与人民的支援和直接参战也是分不开的。在战争中，福建的民兵是支前的骨干，又是部队的得力助手。前沿阵地的民兵，直接地投入了战斗，修工事、运弹药、站岗放哨、抢救伤兵，样样都干；他们不仅会投手榴弹、用步枪，而且还学会了装炮、打炮，成为全能的炮手。为了胜利，福建人民从各个方面、各个岗位上来大力地支援前线。从红领巾的儿童到白发苍苍的老人，每一个人都以自己能够为战争的胜利贡献一分力量，看作是人生最大的光荣。他们不分昼夜，不避风雨，不顾炮弹纷飞，以最大的热情投入了对敌斗争和支前工作，表现出无比英勇和忘我的革命英雄气概。部队需要劳力时，大批优秀的青壮年就涌上前线，帮助部队抢修道路和工事，抢送军需物资，千箱万箱的炮弹，千根万根的木材，千方万方的石料，经过他们的双手，运送到阵地上去，使前线部队顺利地执行了战斗任务；部队需要巩固工事时，群众就把一切适用的材料，送到前线。面对金门的阳塘村，有二十多户居民亲手拆掉自己的房子，把石料献给部队。他们说：“房子宝贵，解放军更宝贵”。为了使部队生活得更好，人民冒着炮火，在阵地上设下了“后勤部”、“前线饭店”、“储兑所”、“流动邮递员”、“理发店”、“洗衣组”等等，从各个方面来为部队服务。人民就是这样热爱和关怀着自己的子弟兵。
    在火热的斗争中，涌现出“小八路”、“前沿十姐妹”、“五姑娘”、“十八好汉”、“二十三勇士”等无数动人的英雄事迹和英雄人物。十二岁的何大年同四个小伙伴，经常冒着炮火，背地里穿梭在阵地上为部队修接被打断了的电话线。像这样动人的英雄事迹和英雄人物是不胜枚举的。厦门前线人民曾用诗歌赞扬道：
      厦门英雄岛，英名天下扬，
      机警小八路，顽强五姑娘，
      弹下收庄稼，阵前送水浆，
      军民成一体，威力镇海疆。
    在对敌斗争胜利的同时，福建社会主义建设也出现大跃进的局面，粮食总产量比一九五七年翻了一番，提前实现了千斤省，工业也掀起了全民大炼钢铁的高潮，结束了福建省“手无寸钢”的历史
    一九五八年我们不仅取得了对敌斗争的胜利，而且在社会主义建设上也出现了全面大跃进的局面。那就是：粮食总产量比一九五七年翻了一番，提前实现了千斤省，结束了我省粮食一向依靠外地支援的历史；花生产量、造林面积，都获得了成倍的增长；其他各种经济作物、渔业、盐业、畜牧业，也都有很大的发展。在工业上，掀起了一个全民大办工业、大炼钢铁的高潮，小型工业遍地开花，工业总产值增长百分之七十八；提前超额完成了国家分配给我省的钢铁生产任务，结束了我省“手无寸钢”的历史。随着工农业生产的大跃进，交通运输、文教卫生等事业也有了巨大发展。全省铁路运输里程达到八百二十九公里，公路的修建增加了四倍，初步形成了以铁路为中心的四通八达的交通运输网，进一步改变了我省交通不便的面貌；全省普及了小学教育，开展了勤工俭学运动，进一步扫除了文盲和推广了普通话；全省基本消灭了血吸虫病，其他疾病的防治工作也进一步地加强了。
    这些伟大的成就，是在对敌斗争任务十分繁重的情况下，经过艰苦斗争取得的。在紧张战斗的日子里，全省人民对社会主义生产建设立下雄心大志，提出“在战斗中争取高产纪录，才算是英雄中的英雄”、“铁水烫死侵略者，粮海淹没野心狼”的豪迈口号。特别值得指出的是，前沿地区的人民，在敌人炮火严重的破坏和威胁下，他们根据敌人打炮的规律，大打小干，小打大干，白天打，晚上干，这边打，那边干，顽强地坚持了生产建设。庄稼被打坏，随即填平弹坑、随即补种；浅水滩上的蠔石被炮击，就搬到深水滩中去生产；渔网渔具被损坏，就速迅修补好，再扬帆出海打捕。厦门的前线人民公社，曾创造了蠔肉亩产三千斤的高产纪录，水稻产量也比一九五七年增长八成，并利用敌人送来的弹片，作为炼钢的原料，夺取了厦门市炼钢的冠军。英雄的人民就这样在同敌人斗争中创造了生产建设上的奇迹。
    我人民解放军坚持和发扬了既是战斗队，又是工作队，既是社会主义的保卫者，又是社会主义建设者的光荣传统。一面英勇奋战，保卫生产建设；一面就像建设自己的家乡一样，积极地参加本省沿海岛屿和城乡的社会主义建设。仅去年一月到十一月间，军队支援地方建设就作了三百多万个工，创造了很多财富。
    事实证明，我们同帝国主义斗争越坚决，就越能教育群众，动员群众，又多又快地进行社会主义建设；而建设得越多越快，我们就越有力量来支援前线。反帝斗争对动员和教育人民起了很大的作用，它把全省人民的生产积极性更进一步地调动起来了。前线的每一个胜利，都鼓舞着全省人民生产建设的更大干劲；而生产建设的大跃进，钢、粮、木大丰收的喜讯，又反过来鼓舞着前线三军在战斗中争取更大的胜利。有一首民歌唱得好：
      红红太阳照山坡，千门大炮齐唱歌，
      胜利捷报随风送，后方钢粮增产多；
      红红太阳照山坡，工农齐唱跃进歌，
      跃进喜报送前线，战士卫国立功多。
    福建前线对敌斗争和生产建设的两大胜利，是在党和中央人民政府英明领导和全国人民支援下取得的，现在福建人民继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，为完成工农业生产任务，巩固国防而奋斗
    前方和后方、军队和人民的共产主义大协作，并肩作战，携手生产，保证了对敌斗争和生产建设的两大胜利。这个胜利是伟大的、全面的、史无前例的。这个胜利是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利，是毛主席军事思想的胜利。这个胜利是在党中央、毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导下取得的，也是同全国人民的大力支援分不开的。不能忘记，在我们对敌斗争艰苦的日子里，全国人民除了在物质上给予我们以大力支援外，同时，还派出了慰问团，不远千里跋涉，来到福建前线慰问，极大地鼓舞了我省军民的斗志和干劲。在这里，我谨代表福建全省军民向全国各地人民致以衷心的感谢。
    一九五九年，我们要在一九五八年胜利的基础上，在中央、毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，团结一切能够团结的力量，调动一切能够调动的积极因素，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，为争取一九五九年生产建设更大更好更全面的跃进，为继续巩固国防，把美帝侵略势力赶出台湾海峡，保卫祖国和平建设和世界和平而奋斗！
