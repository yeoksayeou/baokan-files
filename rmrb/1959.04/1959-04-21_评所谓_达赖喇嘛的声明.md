    A Critique of the So-Called "Statement by the Dalai Lama"
    Xinhua News Agency Political Reporter
    Xinhua, April 20th. A political reporter from this agency comments: The so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" distributed on April 18th in Tezpur via Indian diplomatic officials is a clumsy document full of feeble arguments, blatant lies, and glaring loopholes.

    Ignoring the fact that China is a unified country formed by Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uyghur, and dozens of other ethnic groups, this statement begins by touting the so-called "independence" of Tibetans. In fact, Tibet's political and religious systems were gradually established over several hundred years, from the 13th to the 18th centuries, by the central government in Beijing. Even the title, status, and authority of the Dalai Lama were not determined by the Tibetans themselves. The so-called Tibetan independence in modern history has always been a conspiracy by British imperialism to invade China, primarily Tibet. This statement, starting with the so-called Tibetan independence, proves that the drafter of the statement reflects the will of imperialist aggressors and fundamentally opposes the 1951 Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. The 1951 agreement explicitly affirmed that Tibet is part of the People's Republic of China, but this statement does not mention this point at all. This fact alone makes the statement's claim that the original Tibetan local government "did its utmost to abide by the Seventeen-Article Agreement" unbelievable.

    This statement insists that the 1951 Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was created "under the pressure of the Chinese government"; that after the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, "the Tibetan government did not enjoy any degree of autonomy"; and even that the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region "had no power, and decisions on all important matters were made by the Chinese authorities."

    The truth is this: the agreement was reached between the Central People's Government and representatives of the Tibetan local government after multiple negotiations and full consultations from late April to late May 1951. In a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong in October 1951, after the agreement was signed, the Dalai Lama stated that the agreement was reached "on a friendly basis by both sides" and expressed "the unanimous support of the Tibetan local government and the Tibetan monks and laypeople." After the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, it fully and faithfully implemented the Seventeen-Article Agreement. The original political system of Tibet, the Dalai Lama's inherent status and functions were not changed; officials at all levels of monks and laymen continued to serve as usual; religious activities and local people's customs were respected; and Tibetan currency continued to circulate. The agreement stipulated that the Tibetan local government should automatically carry out reforms, and the Tibetan army should be gradually reorganized into the People's Liberation Army, but this was never carried out. At the end of 1956, the central government even announced to the Tibetan local government that democratic reforms could be postponed until 1962. In a word, in the past eight years, the political, social, and religious systems in Tibet remained the same as before the peaceful liberation. Almost no internal affairs in Tibet were not handled by the original Tibetan local government (the Kashag). In order to implement regional autonomy in Tibet according to the Constitution, the central government established the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in April 1956, headed by the Dalai Lama. The reason why this preparatory committee did not play a role was precisely because of the obstruction of the original Tibetan local government, because they did not want regional autonomy at all; what they wanted was the "Tibetan independence" that the imperialists wanted. They painstakingly conspired to undermine the Seventeen-Article Agreement, from directing Khampa bandits to harass to their own public launch of a full-scale armed rebellion on March 10th.

    This statement does not point out any facts that the original Tibetan local government made efforts to abide by the Seventeen-Article Agreement, nor does it point out any facts that the Central People's Government violated the Seventeen-Article Agreement. The only fact it raises is the Central People's Government's suppression of the rebellion in the original Xikang region in 1955. But the whole world knows that the Xikang region does not belong to Tibet at all; it used to be Xikang Province, and later belonged to Sichuan Province. People know that it was precisely in the summer of 1955, when the Dalai Lama and his entourage were returning to Tibet after attending the National People's Congress and passing through Sichuan, that the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet could not wait to conspire to set fires and direct the Khampa people to launch a rebellion immediately. Their attempt was to use the Khampa rebellion as the front line to cover the independence of the Tibet region by driving out the Han. They overestimated the combat power of the Khampa people and the danger of the terrain. So they quickly decided that inciting the Khampa people to rebel first was a great advantage. The facts were contrary to their assumptions, and the rebellion was quickly quelled. In the battle to quell the rebellion, of course, some people would die and some buildings would be damaged, which must be the responsibility of the rebels, first of all the directors of the rebellion. Apart from this, there was no such thing as many lamas being killed or many temples being destroyed. This statement cites the rebellion in the Xikang region, which does not belong to Tibet at all, to attack the Central People's Government for violating the Seventeen-Article Agreement, which not only proves that the Central People's Government fully complied with this agreement, but also proves that the Tibetan rebel group was the commander of the Khampa rebellion.

    This statement also distorts the facts when talking about the course of the rebellion launched from March 10th to 19th. Everyone knows that March 10th was the date of the launch of the rebellion. The rebel group chose this date because the Dalai Lama himself decided to go to the Tibet Military Region Auditorium to watch a literary and artistic performance on this day, and the request to watch this literary and artistic performance was also proposed by the Dalai Lama himself a month earlier. The statement dares not directly deny this fact, and deliberately vaguely says that the Dalai Lama "agreed" to watch the literary and artistic performance, and the date of March 10th is said to be "suddenly stipulated." Who stipulated it, the statement dares not say. However, the Dalai Lama made it very clear in a letter to General Tan Guansan, the acting representative of the central government in Tibet, on March 11th: "Yesterday (referring to March 10th) I decided to go to the military region to watch a play, but due to the instigation of a few bad people, the monks and laypeople did not understand the truth and followed them, blocking it, and it was indeed impossible to visit." The statement avoids talking about the three letters that the Dalai Lama gave to General Tan Guansan, proving that the person writing this statement dares not face the facts. The statement says that the People's Liberation Army reinforced Lhasa and Tibet before March 17th, and that "on March 17th, two or three mortar shells were fired at the Norbulingka Palace," which is completely and utterly fabricated. The person who concocted the lie preemptively opened a back door for himself: "Fortunately, the shells all fell into a nearby pond!" But since the People's Liberation Army was going to attack, why did they only fire two or three shells, and after they hit the pond, why didn't they fire another one?

    The statement's account of the Dalai Lama's departure from Lhasa is also noteworthy. It says, "The advisors recognized the danger to the Dalai Lama's person, and in that difficult situation, it became urgent for the Dalai Lama, his family members, and his senior officials to leave Lhasa." This passage shows that it was not the Dalai Lama himself but the so-called "advisors" who realized that they had to leave Lhasa. This is an undeniable revelation about the truth of the Dalai Lama being abducted from Lhasa. In his letter of March 11th, the Dalai Lama mentioned that "reactionary bad elements are using the excuse of protecting my safety to carry out activities that endanger me." The letter of March 12th also said, "Yesterday I notified the Kashag, ordering the illegal People's Conference to be dissolved immediately, and the reactionary elements who arrogantly entered the Norbulingka in the name of protecting me must be withdrawn immediately." This shows that after March 10th, the Dalai Lama was surrounded by rebel armed forces and was abducted on March 17th. The statement dares not deny these facts, making the so-called Dalai Lama's "willing to declare categorically" that he left Lhasa "out of his own free will, and not being held hostage" an obvious deception.

    There are various signs in the statement that make people suspect whether it is the Dalai Lama's own statement. First, the content of the statement completely violates the many speeches and articles published by the Dalai Lama himself in the past eight years, and even the three personal letters from the Dalai Lama after the rebellion on March 10th. Even when the Dalai Lama was surrounded by reactionary elements in India in 1956, he never expressed the kind of views in this statement that split the motherland and cater to foreign aggressors in his conversation with Premier Zhou Enlai. Second, this statement is published in the form of the Dalai Lama's own statement, but in the statement, there is not a single first-person "I" character, all of which are third-person "he" characters, which is completely not Tibetan style, but some European style or quasi-European style. Some concepts and words in the statement are also foreign. For example, the so-called "Chinese suzerainty" was first created by British imperialism. British aggression against Tibet was carried out under the cover of acknowledging China's so-called suzerainty over Tibet. This term has never been used in the documents of the Chinese Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government. Now, this rebel team in Tibet is entirely cultivated by the British. The expansionist elements in India have inherited this disreputable legacy of the British, so the minds of the people in this team are colluding with foreign countries, facing India, and turning their backs on the motherland. Look, how intimate they are! They are simply flirting and inseparable. Some phrases in the statement are very similar to the phrases used by some foreign newspapers and politicians when talking about the Tibetan rebellion, such as "Tibetans and Chinese Han people are different," and the Dalai Lama is the "spiritual leader" of Buddhists, and so on. From the above circumstances, people have reason to suspect that this statement is not the Dalai Lama's own statement, but is imposed on the Dalai Lama by others.

    This statement said a truth, that is, Tibetans are different from Han people. This truth applies to Mongolians, Manchus, Uyghurs, Huis, the Zhuang people in Guangxi, the Miao and Yao people in the southern provinces, and dozens of other ethnic minorities, all of whom are different from the Han people. But all these ethnic minorities have not demanded independence. They have all established autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties in the big family of the motherland. Tibet has never been an independent country in the history of the past several hundred years, and no country in the world recognizes Tibet as an independent country and has diplomatic relations with Tibet. Now, suddenly it is said that it wants independence. The so-called independence is actually to turn Tibet into a foreign colony or protectorate.

    Publishing such a document called the Dalai Lama's statement at the moment, talking about the so-called Tibetan independence, people cannot help but ask: Is this an attempt to put the Dalai Lama in a position hostile to the motherland and block the Dalai Lama's path to returning to the embrace of the motherland? Is this an attempt to create a situation that forces the Indian government to allow Tibetan rebels to carry out anti-China political activities in India?

    Observers in Beijing pointed out that the statement issued in Tezpur, India, will not have any impact on the situation in Tibet except to make the Tibetan people more aware of the true face of the Tibetan traitors. The statement says that it hopes that Tibet's recent "difficulties will pass quickly and there will be no more bloodshed." This hope is indeed realistic. The rebellion that broke out more than a month ago will not last long. The People's Liberation Army troops have not only quickly crushed the rebellion in the Lhasa area, but also quickly crushed the rebel groups south of the Yarlung Zangbo River. The People's Liberation Army troops have already achieved great victories in the battle to quell the rebellion, and in the past few days have controlled the entire northern border line of our country in the Himalayas. Only a small group of Khampa rebels ran to India. In the battle to quell the rebellion, the local Tibetan people completely stood on the side of the People's Liberation Army. The coerced elements left the rebel ranks one after another and went home to produce. Not only will the bloodshed become a thing of the past, but the backward, dark, and cruel old Tibet will also become a thing of the past.

    评所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”
    新华社政治记者
    新华社20日讯　本社政治记者评论：4月18日在提斯浦尔经由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，是一个理屈词穷、谎话连篇、漏洞百出的拙劣文件。
    不顾中国是由汉族、藏族、蒙族、维吾尔族等几十个民族形成的统一国家的事实，这个声明一开始就鼓吹西藏人的所谓“独立”。事实上，西藏的政治制度和宗教制度都是在过去由十三世纪至十八世纪的几百年间由北京的中央政府陆续规定的，甚至达赖喇嘛的称号、地位和职权，也不是西藏人自己规定的。近代史上的所谓西藏独立，从来就是英帝国主义侵略中国首先是侵略西藏的阴谋。这个声明从所谓西藏独立开始，证明了声明的起草者反映着帝国主义侵略者的意志，而根本反对1951年关于和平解放西藏的协议。1951年协议一开始就确认西藏是中华人民共和国的一部分，这个声明却没有一句话说到这一点。只是这个事实，就使得声明所谓原西藏地方政府“尽最大力量来遵守十七条协议”的话，无法令人置信。
    这个声明硬说，1951年的关于和平解放西藏的十七条协议是“在中国政府的压力下”造成的；中国人民解放军进驻西藏后“西藏政府没有享受任何程度的自治”；甚至西藏自治区筹备委员会“也没有什么权力，关于一切重要问题的决定都是由中国当局作出的”。
    事实真相是这样：这一协议，是中央人民政府同西藏地方政府的代表从1951年4月下旬到5月下旬经过多次谈判和充分协商然后达成的。达赖喇嘛在协议签订后的1951年10月间给毛泽东主席的电报中曾说到这个协议是“双方代表在友好基础上”达成的，并且表示“西藏地方政府及藏族僧俗人民一致拥护”。人民解放军进驻西藏以后，完全忠实地履行十七条协议。西藏原有的政治制度、达赖喇嘛的固有地位和职权均未予以变更；各级僧俗官员照常供职；宗教活动和当地人民的风俗习惯，都受到尊重；藏钞也继续流通。协议中规定的西藏地方政府应自动进行改革，藏军应逐步改编为人民解放军，一直没有进行。到1956年底，中央还向西藏地方政府宣布在1962年以前可以不进行民主改革。一句话，在过去八年中，西藏地方的政治制度、社会制度和宗教制度，仍然同和平解放以前一样。西藏内部的事务，几乎没有那一件不是经由原西藏地方政府（即噶厦）负责进行。中央为了根据宪法在西藏地方实行区域自治，在1956年4月间成立了以达赖喇嘛为首的西藏自治区筹备委员会。这个筹备委员会之所以没有起什么作用，正是由于原西藏地方政府的阻挠，因为他们根本不要区域自治，他们要的是帝国主义者所要的“西藏独立”。他们处心积虑地阴谋破坏十七条协议，从指使康巴叛匪骚扰一直到他们自己在3月10日这个日子公开发动全面的武装叛乱。
    这个声明没有指出任何一件原西藏地方政府努力遵守十七条协议的事实，也没有指出任何一件中央人民政府违背十七条协议的事实。它所提出的唯一事实，是1955年中央人民政府对于原西康地方叛乱的平定。但是全世界都知道，西康地方根本不属于西藏，以前是西康省，后来是属于四川省。人们知道，正是在1955年夏季，达赖喇嘛等一行出席全国人民代表大会完毕返藏道经四川的时候，西藏上层反动集团迫不及待，阴谋放火，指使康巴人立即举行叛乱。他们的企图是以康巴叛乱为前线，掩护西藏本区驱汉独立。他们高估了康巴人的战斗力和地形的险阻。所以他们迅即决策，以为煽动康巴人首先叛乱是大为得计的。事实与他们的设想相反，这个叛乱是迅速平定了。在平定叛乱的战斗中当然会死一些人，损坏一些建筑物，这必须由叛乱者首先是叛乱的指使者负责。除此以外，根本没有所谓许多喇嘛被杀、许多寺院被摧毁的事。这个声明举出根本不属于西藏的西康地方的叛乱来攻击中央人民政府违反十七条协议，不但反证了中央人民政府完全遵守这一协议，而且恰恰证明了西藏叛乱集团正是康巴叛乱的指挥者。
    这个声明在谈到3月10日至19日发动叛乱的经过时也是歪曲事实的。大家知道，3月10日是发动叛乱的日期。叛乱集团选定这个日期，是因为达赖喇嘛自己决定在这一天到西藏军区礼堂去看文艺表演，而看这次文艺表演的要求也是达赖喇嘛自己在一个月以前提出的。声明不敢直接否认这个事实，故意含混地说什么达赖喇嘛“同意”去看文艺表演，而3月10日这个日期又说是“突然规定”的，是谁规定的，声明可不敢讲。但是，达赖喇嘛在3月11日给中央驻藏代理代表谭冠三将军的信中说得很清楚，“昨天（指3月10日）我决定去军区看戏，但由于少数坏人的煽动，而僧俗人民不解真象追随其后，进行阻拦，确实无法去访”。声明避而不谈达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封信，证明了写这个声明的人不敢面对事实。声明说人民解放军在3月17日以前就向拉萨和西藏增援，以及“3月17日，迫击炮朝着罗布林卡宫打了两三炮”，这完全是彻头彻尾的捏造。编造谎言的人给自己预先开了一道后门：“幸而炮弹都落到附近的一个池塘里去了”！但是，解放军既然要进攻，为什么偏偏只打两三发炮弹，而且在打进了池塘以后，就不多打一发呢？
    声明中关于达赖喇嘛离开拉萨的说法也很引人注意。它说，“顾问们认识到对于达赖喇嘛人身的危险，在那种困难的情况下，对达赖喇嘛、他的家庭成员以及他的高级官员来说，离开拉萨就成为十分紧迫的了。”这一段话表明，并不是达赖喇嘛本人而是所谓“顾问们”认识到要离开拉萨。这是关于达赖喇嘛被劫出拉萨的真相的无法掩饰的流露。达赖喇嘛3月11日的信中曾说到“反动的坏分子们正在借口保护我的安全而进行着危害我的活动”。3月12日的信中又说，“昨天我通知噶厦，责令非法的人民会议必须立即解散，以保卫我为名而狂妄地进驻罗布林卡的反动分子必须立即撤走。”这说明3月10日以后达赖喇嘛是被叛乱武装包围起来，并在3月17日被劫走的。声明不敢否认这些事实，使所谓达赖喇嘛“愿意断然声明”他离开拉萨是“出于他自己的自由意志，而不是被劫持”云云，成为一种显然的欺人之谈。
    声明中有种种迹象使人怀疑它究竟是不是达赖喇嘛本人的声明。第一，声明的内容同达赖喇嘛本人过去八年中所发表的许多谈话和文章，直到3月10日叛乱发生后达赖喇嘛的三封亲笔信，完全违反。甚至1956年达赖喇嘛在印度被反动分子包围的时候，他在同周恩来总理的谈话中，也决没有表示过这次声明中那种分裂祖国而迎合外国侵略者的观点。第二，这个声明是以达赖喇嘛本人的声明的形式发表的，可是在声明中却找不到一个第一人称的“我”字，一律是第三人称的“他”字，这完全不是西藏文体，而是某种欧洲文体或准欧洲文体。声明中的某些观念和词句也是外国的，例如所谓“中国的宗主权”的说法，就是英帝国主义首创的，英国侵略西藏就是在承认中国对西藏的所谓宗主权的掩护下进行的。在中国中央人民政府和西藏地方政府的文件中从来没有使用过这种字样。现在西藏的这一个叛乱班子，完全是英国人培养起来的。印度的扩张主义分子继承了英国的这一份不光采的遗产，所以这个班子中的人们的心思，是里通外国，向着印度，背着祖国的。你看，他们双方是何等亲热呵！简直卿卿我我，难舍难分。声明中的有些词句，同最近某些外国的报刊和政治家谈到西藏叛乱事件时的词句，十分近似，例如“西藏人和中国的汉人是不同的”、达赖喇嘛是佛教徒的“精神领袖”，等等。从以上的情况看来，人们有理由怀疑，这个声明不是达赖喇嘛本人的声明，而是别人强加于达赖喇嘛的。
    这个声明说了一个真理，就是西藏人同汉人不同。这个真理适用于蒙古人、满人、维吾尔人、回人、在广西的僮人、南方几省的苗人和瑶人以及其他几十个少数民族，他们都不同于汉人。但是所有这些少数民族并没有要求独立，他们都在祖国的大家庭内建立了自治区、自治州、自治县。西藏在近几百年的历史中，从来不是独立国，世界上也没有哪一个国家认为西藏是个独立国，同西藏发生外交关系。现在忽然说要独立了。所谓独立也者，实际上就是要使西藏变为外国的殖民地或者保护国。
    在目前发表这样一个被称为达赖喇嘛声明的文件，大谈其所谓西藏独立，人们不禁要问：这是不是企图把达赖喇嘛置于同祖国敌对的地位，堵塞达赖喇嘛重返祖国怀抱的道路呢？这是不是企图造成一种形势，迫使印度政府允许西藏叛乱分子在印度进行反对中国的政治活动呢？
    北京的观察家指出，在印度提斯浦尔发表的声明，除了使西藏人民更认清西藏叛国分子的真面目以外，对于西藏的局势不会发生任何影响。声明中说希望西藏最近的“困难很快就会过去，而不再流血”。这个希望倒是切合实际的。一个多月以前爆发的叛乱不要很久就会结束。人民解放军部队不但迅速粉碎了拉萨地区的叛乱，而且迅速粉碎了雅鲁藏布江以南地区的叛乱集团。人民解放军部队已经在平叛战斗中获得了很大的胜利，在过去几天中已经控制了喜马拉雅山北部我国的全部国境线。只有不大的一批康巴叛乱分子跑到印度去。在平叛战斗中，当地的藏族人民完全站在人民解放军这一边。被裹胁的分子纷纷脱离叛匪队伍，回家生产。不但流血将成为过去，而且落后、黑暗、残酷的旧西藏也将成为过去。
