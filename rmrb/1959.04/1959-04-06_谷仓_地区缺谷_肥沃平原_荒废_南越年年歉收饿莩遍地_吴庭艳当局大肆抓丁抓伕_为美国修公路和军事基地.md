　　Comprehensive report from our newspaper. Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: Although South Vietnam's natural conditions are superior to North Vietnam's, while the agricultural output of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam continues to increase, South Vietnam under the rule of the American-Ngo clique suffers annual crop failures, and production is declining.

　　According to a recent report in the "Tropical and Mediterranean Markets" weekly, South Vietnam's two rice crops in 1958-1959 yielded only 3.2 million tons of dried grain. Before the war, in 1938-1939, South Vietnam produced 4 million tons of grain. If the special circumstances of the war years and the early post-war period are excluded, the 1958-1959 production has fallen to the lowest level of rice production in South Vietnam in decades.

　　In the years before the war, South Vietnam exported and shipped more than one million tons of grain to North Vietnam each year. In 1957, only 180,000 tons were exported. In 1958, the original plan was to export 250,000 tons, but less than half of that was achieved.

　　The harvest in many provinces in northern and central South Vietnam before and after this year's Spring Festival was only half of the normal yield.

　　Quang Nam province has an average yield of only 500 kilograms per hectare (approximately 60+ jin per Chinese acre). Khanh Hoa province has suffered crop failures for three consecutive years, and beggars can be found all along the route from Quang Nam to Khanh Hoa.

　　The reasons for these crop failures in these areas are partly due to natural disasters, but the more important reason is the South Vietnamese authorities' persecution of former resistance personnel and their policies of conscripting laborers. Northern and central South Vietnam were mostly base areas and guerrilla zones during the anti-war period. The South Vietnamese authorities' persecution activities were particularly frenzied in this area. As a result of three or four years of arrests, massacres, and forced displacement of the people, some villages have lost one-third of their population, most of whom are young and middle-aged. Regardless of whether it is the busy farming season or slack season, these remaining laborers have to perform two or three months of hard labor each year for the American-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, building strategic highways and military bases for them. Due to the above reasons, there is a severe shortage of rural labor, leading to very common phenomena of abandonment and sparse planting.

　　Land rent and taxes in South Vietnam are also becoming heavier and heavier. For example, farmers in Binh Dinh province now pay ten times more rent and taxes each year than during the anti-war period. Some farmers even have to pay five yuan in tax for the twenty yuan they earn from firewood and selling seedlings.

　　It is not difficult to understand why some Saigon newspapers often worry about the declining purchasing power and the serious phenomenon of spreading famine among South Vietnamese farmers (who account for more than 80% of the population). According to reports, this famine is most severe in Quang Ngai province south of the demarcation line, where many farmers have starved to death. What worries the Saigon press even more is that the Mekong Delta, known as the "granary," is now experiencing famines rarely seen in history. According to a report in the Saigon "Morning Post" on March 6, due to the increasing number of starving people, there are more and more beggars in South Vietnam, so much so that despite the South Vietnamese authorities designating "no begging zones" to beautify the city, they still cannot stop the activities of beggars in the city.

　　However, the South Vietnamese authorities, disregarding the life and death of the people, are mainly considering how to sell the large quantities of American grain and other non-staple foods imported each year. Some people even openly advocate restricting the planting of rice and sugarcane.

　　According to reports, more than 600,000 hectares of farmland in South Vietnam were still abandoned in 1958. The Saigon "Chung Sheng Daily" also stated on March 7 that the "abandonment phenomenon" of the "fertile plains" is "heartbreaking."

    “谷仓”地区缺谷　“肥沃平原”荒废
    南越年年歉收饿莩遍地
    吴庭艳当局大肆抓丁抓伕
    为美国修公路和军事基地
    本报综合报道　据新华社河内消息：虽然南越的自然条件优于北越，但是在越南民主共和国农业产量不断增加的同时，美吴集团统治下的南越的稻子却年年歉收，产量每况愈下。
    据“热带和地中海市场”周刊最近报道，南越1958—1959年度的两造稻子只收干谷三百二十万吨。而战前1938—1939年度，南越产谷四百万吨。如果有特殊情况的战争年代和战后初期不算的话，1958—1959年产量已经降到南越数十年来稻谷产量的最低水平。
    战前几年，南越出口和运到北越的粮食每年有一百多万吨。而1957年只出口了十八万吨。1958年原计划出口二十五万吨，结果一半也没有完成。
    南越北部和中部很多省份今年春节前后的收成只有常年的一半。
    广南省平均每公顷产量只有五百公斤（约合每华亩六十多市斤）。庆和省已接连三年歉收，从广南到庆和，乞食农民沿途皆是。
    这些地区歉收的原因部分由于自然灾害造成，但是更主要的原因是由于南越当局对前抗战人员的迫害和抓伕、抓丁的政策。南越北部和中部在抗战期间大都是根据地和游击区。南越当局在这一带的迫害活动特别疯狂。经过三、四年来的逮捕、屠杀和人民被迫逃亡的结果，有的村子已减少了三分之一人口，其中大部分是青壮年。这些剩下的劳动力不管农忙农闲平均每人每年要为美国—吴庭艳集团作两、三个月的苦役，为他们修筑战略公路和军事基地。由于上述种种原因，农村劳动力很缺乏，以至抛荒和薄种的现象非常普遍。
    南越的地租和税收也越来越重，如平定省农民目前每年交纳的租税十倍于抗战时期，有的农民打柴、卖苗所得到的二十元也要交五元的税。
    这也就不难理解西贡一些报纸为什么经常忧虑地谈到南越农民（占人口80％以上）的购买力下降和饥馑蔓延的严重现象。据报道，这种饥馑在分界线以南的广义省最为严重，那里已有许多农民饿死。更使西贡报刊忧虑的是，素有“谷仓”之称的湄公河三角洲，现在也闹起历史上少见的饥荒了。据西贡“晨报”3月6日透露，由于饥民不断增加，南越的乞丐已越来越多，以至尽管南越当局为了装点市容而划出了“禁乞区”，还是阻止不了城市中乞丐的活动。
    可是不顾人民死活的南越当局，主要考虑的却是如何销售每年大量进口的美国粮食和其他副食品。甚至还有人公然主张限制种稻子和甘蔗。
    据报道，1958年南越仍有六十多万公顷田地荒废着。西贡“钟声报”3月7日也认为“肥沃平原”的“荒废现象”是“令人痛心”的事。　（附图片）
