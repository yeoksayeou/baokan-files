Developing Biological Resource Science

Committee Member Qu Zhongxiang Discusses the Study of Yunnan's Biological Resources

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. I firmly support the central government's measures to quell the rebellion in Tibet. As a biological scientist, I will only speak about the achievements and development of biological resource science in Yunnan over the past two years.

Yunnan is known both nationally and internationally for its rich biological resources. How to leverage this enormous potential of natural resources to serve China's socialist production and construction is a very important question. In the past, progress was not significant because the foundation of this discipline was weak, the number of personnel was small and weak, and the terrain of natural resources was extremely vast and scattered, with inconvenient transportation. However, since the past two years, especially in 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's leadership and the general line of socialist construction, and encouraged and promoted by the mass movement of the national science workers marching towards science in full force, unprecedented leaps and bounds have been achieved. The ranks of personnel have expanded, young scientific workers are full of vigor, carrying forward the spirit of hard work, tough work, and clever work, adopting the principles of comprehensive integration and mutual assistance. Most importantly, the great liberation of communist thought has led to great achievements in a year or two. For example, biological resource survey teams have been organized, many nature reserves have been established, botanical gardens, zoos, and introduction farms have been opened, and there is also an advanced scientific biogeographical community experimental station. The establishment of this series of scientific work points marks that biological resource science in Yunnan has a certain foundation and the beginning of a great leap forward. Due to preliminary investigations that have grasped the distribution of natural resources and the general laws of development and change, and the collection and organization of some basic data, preliminary plans for development, utilization, and research have been made. Greater leaps forward and greater achievements are just around the corner.

These newly established scientific work points related to the development and utilization of biological resources all have their own scientific tasks and scopes, but there are also close connections and interrelationships between them. The ultimate goal is to transform plants and animals, transform nature, and serve socialist construction, forming a complete scientific system. For example, the biological survey team is for general understanding, conducting general surveys to serve the establishment of farms, economic crop farms, livestock farms, tea farms, etc., and to find a reliable scientific basis, and is the vanguard of production units. However, it also plays a role in destroying and damaging the original natural vegetation. Therefore, on the other hand, it is necessary to establish nature reserves to protect precious and valuable plants and animals and some natural areas with special significance, so that these areas are not damaged. This is also completely necessary. The former is to serve the expansion of cultivated area in the short term, and the latter is to lay the foundation for long-term scientific research. The tasks of botanical gardens and introduction farms are different. They undertake the task of plant transformation. It is an intermediate factory between wild plants and farms. It is the work of transforming wild plants into cultivated plants, cultivating new varieties, and introducing valuable economic plants, and transforming all wild medicinal plants, oil plants, aromatic plants, fiber plants, rubber plants, etc. It is an indispensable link in resource plants. At the same time, in order to study cutting-edge science, a biogeographical community experimental station established in Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan has special significance. Based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, it studies the transformation and exchange of matter and energy in nature, regards forests as green laboratories, grasps the dynamic laws of nature, and lays the foundation for the work of transforming nature. It complements the aforementioned plant transformation work. In the actual production and transformation of nature in our country, for example, transforming deserts in the north and transforming bamboo forests and grasslands in southern Yunnan into economic vegetation with higher value, whether from the needs of theory or practice, whether from current and long-term plans, the establishment of these departments of plant resource science and the comprehensive development of the entire set cannot be regarded as a huge achievement. There is no doubt that they will gradually grow and prosper on the existing basis. They will play a brilliant role in today's socialist construction and tomorrow's communist construction, and in the great struggle of people marching towards nature and conquering nature. As scientific workers, we cannot help but feel infinite excitement when we look forward to the magnificent prospects of our cause!

Why have these scientific departments been able to achieve such great development in such a short period of time? Undoubtedly, this is a great victory for the general line of socialist construction in scientific work. It is the result of the Party's concern for science and the incomparably superior conditions provided by the superior socialist system.

Putting politics in command and resolutely implementing scientific research work to serve the current socialist construction is our most fundamental experience. In our actual work, we insist on linking research work with the work of local farms, special economic crop farms, coffee farms, livestock farms, tea farms, and other business production units, and directly serve scientific research to current production. This can not only solve many practical problems in production and drive the development of related disciplines, but more importantly, it enables our research work to not deviate from the current political tasks and avoid the tendency of research for research's sake. At the same time, it also enables cadres to receive practical training and improvement, which in turn promotes work. For example, sending graduating students from the Biology Department to relevant units to cultivate their scientific research capabilities, and through collective labor and production practice, they have a further understanding of science serving production and the combination of education and productive labor, and greatly improve their labor concepts and mass concepts, which is of great benefit to their growth and vigorously promotes work.

Secondly, fully following the mass line and relying on the masses is an important method for achieving success in work. In their labor production practice, the masses have mastered extremely rich plants and are familiar with their growth habits and laws. Therefore, fully following the mass line and combining experts with the masses can achieve twice the result with half the effort. This is proven by countless facts. For example, the discovery of a special medicinal plant (Rauvolfia verticillata) for treating high blood pressure in Xishuangbanna is the result of the combination of the masses and experts. Such examples are too numerous to mention. For example, insect pests occurred in cotton fields in southern Yunnan. The mole crickets, or ground tigers, bit off cotton seedlings, causing great losses. Because the mole crickets burrowed under the soil and could not be caught, spraying was also ineffective. The Party Committee mobilized the masses to study the life history of the mole crickets, and quickly brought the collective wisdom of the masses into play, and grasped the law that they came out of the soil to move around at nine o'clock every night. In just one night, hundreds of thousands of mole crickets were captured, and the disaster was quickly extinguished, indicating that the wisdom of the masses is infinite. In terms of resource plant surveys and nature reserve work, we have also achieved more, faster, better, and more economical results because of the cooperation of the masses.

Of course, we have not forgotten that biological resource science is still a young and backward scientific department in our country. It undertakes the major task of tapping the potential of the infinitely rich biological resources of the great motherland. The current achievements are still very inconsistent with the requirements of the motherland's construction. In the future, we must continue to work hard under the leadership of the Party, following the socialist scientific line, and continue to intensify efforts to actively develop this science so that it can better and more quickly serve socialist construction. This requires us to continue to strengthen the ideological transformation of our scientific workers, improve political thinking, improve theoretical level, learn and respect each other in mutual cooperation, cultivate new forces, and gradually improve and strengthen the team, and strive to catch up with the world's scientific level and climb the peak of science.

    发展生物资源科学
    曲仲湘委员谈研究云南生物资源的情况主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告，坚决拥护中央关于平定西藏叛乱的措施。作为一个生物科学工作者，我仅就云南生物资源科学两年来的成就和发展，作如下的发言。
  云南生物资源的丰富是全国全世界都有名的，如何发挥这种巨大的天然资源潜力，为我国的社会主义生产建设服务，是一个非常重大的问题。过去由于这门学科的基础比较薄弱，参加工作人员较少较弱，而自然资源的地面又是极为辽阔分散，交通阻塞不便，所以我们的成绩还不显著。自从近两年来，特别是一九五八年，在党的领导和社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国科学工作者千军万马向科学进军的群众运动的鼓舞和推动下，也无例外的获得跃进的发展。工作人员的队伍扩大了，青年科学工作者的干劲冲天，发扬苦干、硬干、巧干的精神，采取全面结合、互相协助的方针，最主要的是共产主义思想大解放，使一、二年的时间，就取得了很大的成绩。例如组织了生物资源考察队，建立了许多自然保护区，开辟了植物园、动物园和引种场，还有一个先进科学的生物地理群落实验站。这一系列的科学工作点的设立，标志着生物资源科学在云南已经有了一定基础和大跃进的开端。由于初步调查掌握了自然资源分布情况，和发展变化的一般规律，收集和整理了一些基本资料，作出了开发、利用和研究的初步规划，更大的跃进，更大的成绩就要出现在眼前。
    这些新设立的与开发利用生物资源有关的科学工作点，都有自己的科学任务和范围，但相互之间也有密切的联系和互相关联，而最终的目的，都是为了改造动植物、改造自然，为社会主义建设服务，成为一个完整的科学体系。例如生物考察队是为了一般的了解，进行普查工作，为建立农场、经济作物场、畜牧场、茶场等等服务，找出可靠的科学基础，是生产单位的先锋队伍。但是对原有自然植被来说，它又起了摧毁和破坏作用。因此，在另一方面必须建立自然保护区，把珍贵的有价值的动植物和一些具有特别意义的自然地段保护起来，不让这些地区遭到破坏，也是完全必要的。前者是为了眼前的扩大耕种面积服务，后者是为了长远的科学研究工作打基础。至于植物园和引种场的任务又有不同，它担任着植物改造工作，它是野生植物和农场之间的一个中间工厂，是把野生植物改造成为栽培植物的工作，培育新品种和引种有价值的经济植物，改造一切野生的药用植物、油料植物、芳香植物、纤维植物、橡胶植物等等的工作场。它是资源植物中不可缺少的一个环节。同时，为了研究尖端科学，在云南西双版纳自治州建立起来的一个生物地理群落实验站，是具有特殊重要意义的。根据苏联的先进经验，研究自然界物质和能的转化和交换问题，把森林当作绿色试验室，掌握自然界动态的规律，为改造自然的工作打基础。它和前面所说的植物改造工作，是相辅相成的。在我国目前的生产和改造自然的实际中，例如在北方要改造沙漠，在云南南部要改造竹林森林草原，成为价值更高的经济植被等，不论从理论或实际的需要来说，不论从目前和长远打算，这些植物资源科学的部门的建立，和整套的全面的开展，不能不算是一种巨大的成就。无可怀疑它们将在现有的基础上，逐步壮大和兴旺起来，它们将在今天的社会主义建设和明天的共产主义建设中，在人们向自然进军，征服自然的伟大斗争中，发出光辉的作用。作为一个科学工作者，我们远瞻自己事业这种壮丽的前景，就不能不感到无限的兴奋！
    为什么这一方面的科学部门，能够在这样短的时间内获得这些大的发展呢？无可置疑，这是社会主义建设总路线在科学工作中的伟大胜利，是党关怀科学，是优越的社会主义制度，提供了无比优越的条件的结果。
    政治挂帅，坚决贯彻科学研究工作，为当前的社会主义建设服务，是我们最根本的体会。我们在实际工作中，坚持把研究工作和当地的农场，特种经济作物场、咖啡场、畜牧场和茶场等业务生产单位的工作联系起来，把科学研究直接服务于当前生产，这样不仅能解决许多生产上的实际问题、带动有关的学科发展，而且更主要的是使我们研究工作，不脱离当前的政治任务，避免为研究而研究的倾向。同时也使干部受到了实际的锻炼和提高，又反回来推动了工作，例如把生物系临届毕业的同学，下放到有关单位去，培养他们的科学研究能力，通过集体劳动，生产实践，对科学为生产服务，教育与生产劳动相结合有了更进一步的体会，而且大大的提高了他们的劳动观念和群众观念，对于他们的成长有很大的好处，并有力的推动了工作。
    其次，充分走群众路线，依靠群众是工作取得成就的重要方法。群众在劳动生产实践中，掌握了极为丰富的植物，熟习它们生长习性和规律，因此，在工作中充分走群众路线，专家与群众结合，就能事半功倍，这是无数的事实所证明了的。例如在西双版纳发现一种治高血压的特效药用植物（萝扶木），就是群众与专家结合的结果，这种事例是不胜枚举的。又如云南南部棉花田里发生了害虫，地蚕或是叫地老虎，咬断棉苗，损失很大，因为地蚕钻在土壤下面，无法捕捉，喷药也无效，党委发动群众，研究地蚕的生活史，就迅速发挥了群众的集体智慧，掌握了它每天晚上九点钟出土活动的规律，仅一夜的时间就捕捉几十万条，迅速把灾害扑灭了，说明群众的智慧是无穷无尽的。我们在资源植物调查方面，自然保护区工作方面，也都是由于得到群众的协作，才有了多、快、好、省的成绩。
    当然，我们并没有忘记，生物资源科学，在我国还是年青的落后的科学部门，它负担起挖掘伟大祖国无限丰富的生物资源的潜力这一重大任务，目前的成就和祖国建设的要求，还是很不相称的。今后必须继续在党的领导下，遵循着社会主义科学路线，继续加紧努力，积极发展这门科学，使它能够更好和更迅速的，为社会主义建设服务。这就必须继续加强我们科学工作人员的思想改造工作，提高政治思想，提高理论水平，在互相协作中，互相学习和尊重，培养新生力量，逐步提高和壮大队伍，为赶上世界科学水平，攀登科学高峰而努力。
