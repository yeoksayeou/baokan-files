The swift quelling of the Tibetan rebellion demonstrates the strength of the motherland.
Committee Member Da Pao Sheng says: All slanders against our country by imperialists and reactionaries are futile.

Chairman, fellow representatives, fellow committee members:

    I am participating in the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held concurrently, with great joy and together with all the representatives and committee members, and listened to the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC at these two conferences. I fully endorse this series of reports. They summarize the splendid achievements of our people in socialist construction and mobilize the people of the whole country to strive for a greater leap forward in 1959. Under the brilliant guidance of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the vast majority of religious figures in the Islamic community in our country have demonstrated their patriotic enthusiasm and responded to the Party's call to mobilize all positive factors for socialist construction with practical actions. Many activists have emerged among them and have been praised by the masses. However, within the Islamic community, there is still a small handful of scum who, under the guise of religion, engage in activities against the Party, the people, and socialism, such as Ma Zhenwu and his ilk, who, despite the leniency and care shown to them by the Party and the government, still cling to their reactionary stance. They are not only the scum of the Islamic community but also enemies of the people. Through the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle within the Islamic community, this small handful of rightist elements has been basically overthrown. In the anti-rightist struggle in other religious circles, a small handful of rightist elements have also been criticized. In order to purify the internal affairs of religion, we should heighten our vigilance and thoroughly eliminate all feudal privileges and reactionary remnants in religious circles.

    Recently, a small handful of upper-class reactionaries in Tibet, colluding with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and foreign reactionaries, betrayed the motherland and launched a monstrous armed rebellion, which has been resolutely opposed by the people of Tibet and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country. The upper-class reactionaries in Tibet represent imperialism and the most reactionary big serf owners in Tibet. They attempt to maintain the darkest and most cruel serf system, making the Tibetan people live in a perpetually dark and hopeless life. The rebellion of the upper-class reactionaries in Tibet is not a religious issue at all, but a counter-revolutionary armed rebellion attempting to undermine the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of nationalities. The suppression of the rebellion has promoted the further consolidation of the unity of the motherland and the rebirth of Tibet. The swift suppression of the rebellion and the rapid restoration of order demonstrate the strength of the socialist motherland. All slanders against our country by imperialists and reactionaries are futile.

    The so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" distributed in Tezpur on April 18 through Indian foreign officials is a clumsy document full of sophistry, lies, and loopholes. This statement disregards the fact that China is a unified country formed by dozens of ethnic groups, including Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Uyghur, and attempts to advocate the so-called "independence" of Tibet. The style of the statement is not Tibetan, but some kind of European or quasi-European style, and some of the words and concepts are also foreign. We do not recognize this as a statement by the Dalai Lama himself. The three handwritten letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan are sufficient to prove that this statement must be nonsense imposed on him by others.

    Fellow representatives, fellow committee members: The unity of the motherland and the solidarity of nationalities are the guarantee of the happiness of all ethnic groups. The religious freedom and happy life enjoyed by Chinese Muslims and believers of other religions after liberation will absolutely not allow the conspiracies of imperialists and reactionaries to undermine them. We believe that these two conferences will make significant contributions to the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country and the great leap forward in 1959. All our achievements are created by the united strength of all patriotic people in our country. Let us unite closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland—the People's Republic of China—with active actions to complete and overfulfill the 1959 plan!

    Finally, I wish the conference a victory! I wish all representatives and committee members good health!

    迅速平息西藏叛乱说明祖国的强大
    达浦生委员说：帝国主义和反动分子对我国的一切诽谤都是枉费心机主席团，各位代表，各位委员：
    我以万分愉快的心情和各位代表、委员们一起参加了第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和同时举行的中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议，并听取了周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和政协第二届全国委员会李维汉副主席在这两个大会上所作的报告。我完全拥护这一系列的报告，他们总结了我国人民在社会主义建设方面的辉煌成就，并且动员全国人民为实现一九五九年的更大跃进而奋斗。在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国伊斯兰教的绝大多数宗教界人士发挥了他们的爱国热忱，以实际行动响应党的调动一切积极因素进行社会主义建设的号召。他们中间出现了不少的积极分子，获得群众的表扬。但是在伊斯兰教界，还有一小撮披着宗教外衣进行反党、反人民、反社会主义活动的败类，如马震武之流，不顾党和政府对他的宽大和照顾，仍然坚持反动立场。他们不仅是伊斯兰教界的败类，而且是人民的公敌。经过伊斯兰教界的整风和反右派斗争，已基本上把这一小撮右派分子斗倒。其他宗教界在反右派斗争中，也有一小撮右派分子受到批判。为了纯洁宗教内部，我们应该提高警惕，彻底肃清宗教界的一切封建特权和反动的残余势力。
    最近西藏的一小撮上层反动分子勾结帝国主义、蒋匪帮和国外反动派，背叛祖国，发动武装叛乱的滔天罪行，已经遭到西藏人民及全国各族人民的坚决反对。西藏上层反动分子代表帝国主义和西藏最反动的大农奴主，他们企图保持最黑暗、最残酷的农奴制度，使西藏人民永远过着暗无天日的生活。西藏上层反动分子的叛乱根本不是宗教问题，而是企图破坏祖国统一和民族团结的反革命武装叛乱。平息叛乱促进了祖国统一的更加巩固和西藏的新生。叛乱的迅速平息和秩序的迅速恢复，说明了社会主义祖国的强大。帝国主义和反动分子对我国的一切诽谤都是枉费心机。
    四月十八日在提斯浦尔经由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，是一个理屈词穷、谎话连篇、漏洞百出的拙劣文件。这个声明不顾中国是由汉族、藏族、蒙族、维吾尔族等几十个民族形成的统一国家的事实，妄图鼓吹西藏的所谓“独立”。声明的文体不是西藏文体，而是某种欧洲文体或准欧洲文体，其中某些词句和观念也是外国的。我们不承认这是达赖喇嘛本人的声明，从达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封亲笔信足可证明，这个声明一定是别人强加于他的一派胡说。
    各位代表、各位委员：祖国统一和民族团结是各族人民幸福的保证。中国穆斯林和其他宗教信徒在解放后所享受的宗教信仰自由和幸福生活，绝对不允许帝国主义和反动派的阴谋破坏。我们相信，这两个会议将对我国各族人民的大团结和一九五九年的大跃进作出重大的贡献。我们的一切成就是我国全体爱国人民团结一致的力量创造的。让我们在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，紧密地团结起来，用完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的积极行动，来迎接我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国建立十周年！
    最后，敬祝大会胜利！敬祝各位代表、委员身体健康！
