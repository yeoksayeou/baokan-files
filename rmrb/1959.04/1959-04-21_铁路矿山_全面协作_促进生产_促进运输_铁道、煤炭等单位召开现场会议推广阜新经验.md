Railway and Mining Industries Fully Collaborate to Promote Production and Transportation
Iron Road, Coal and Other Units Convene On-Site Meeting to Promote Fuxin Experience
    (By our newspaper) A national coal transportation road and mine collaboration on-site meeting was recently held in Fuxin City. The meeting called for the widespread promotion of the Fuxin City's great collaboration experience across the country to ensure the completion of transportation tasks.
    The meeting believed that the valuable aspect of the Fuxin City experience lies in finding an important way to transport large quantities of materials with a small number of freight cars. The road and mine great collaboration in Fuxin City is the product of putting politics in command and implementing the idea of "the whole country as one chess game." Through the rectification movement, both the road and mine sides, based on the principles of "ensuring key points, serving production, and accelerating vehicle turnaround," united all aspects of the road and mine into one rope on the basis of unified thinking, unified production and sales, and unified transportation organization. And through the method of vigorously launching mass movements, mobilizing the masses to carry out technical revolutions, and creating dozens of advanced operating methods of parallel and cross-operations, the technical operation process was comprehensively reformed, simplifying the procedures from the original eleven to five. At the same time, under the call of "using coal to ensure steel," the people of Fuxin City vigorously supported loading and unloading, forming a city-wide climax of great collaboration. From October last year to March this year, with very little increase in equipment, transportation efficiency doubled. The time for one operation (from the arrival of empty cars at the station to the departure of fully loaded coal) was shortened from 11.6 hours to 5.8 hours.
    Due to close collaboration and highly unified command, the masses created a magic weapon to shorten the time for one operation - organizing "Red Flag Trains." In the past five months, Fuxin Station has dispatched a total of 590 "Red Flag Trains," which played a decisive role in shortening operation time and improving vehicle turnover rate for Fuxin and the marshaling stations along the way.
    The representatives unanimously believed that coal production and railway transportation have a relationship of mutual dependence and mutual promotion. The road and mine sides in Fuxin City, due to correctly handling this relationship and acting in unison, coupled with a relatively thorough system reform and in-depth mass movement, powerfully promoted the double leap forward of coal production and railway transportation.
    This year, coal transportation accounts for about 40% of the entire railway transportation task. Conscientiously promoting the Fuxin City experience is of great significance. The meeting requested all localities to vigorously promote the experience of road and mine collaboration in Fuxin to ensure that the operation time of freight cars is reduced by more than one-third compared to 1958; the net weight of coal is increased by two tons; and the number of direct trains dispatched is doubled. In this way, without any investment, the country can increase the equipment capacity of 7,000 vehicles per day. Railway transportation serves many objects and has complex collaborative relationships. Therefore, the meeting believed that the experience of great collaboration in coal transportation in Fuxin City has universal significance. This experience is not only applicable to coal transportation, but also can be learned and promoted by transportation departments between factories, mines, stations, and ports across the country, so as to fully tap the transportation potential.
    This meeting was jointly convened by the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee. The meeting started on April 6 and ended on April 12. Representatives from 22 provinces and cities' railway bureaus and coal bureaus participated in the meeting. Representatives from the State Planning Commission, the Economic Construction Commission, and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also attended the meeting.
    Before the end of the on-site meeting, the representatives issued a proposal to all railway and coal mine workers across the country to unite the road and mine, ask for vehicles from time, ask for vehicles from collaboration, transport more coal, and transport coal quickly, setting off a competition to learn from Fuxin, catch up with Fuxin, and surpass Fuxin.

    铁路矿山  全面协作  促进生产  促进运输
    铁道、煤炭等单位召开现场会议推广阜新经验
    本报讯　全国煤炭运输路矿协作现场会议最近在阜新市召开。会议要求在全国普遍推广阜新市大协作的经验，保证运输任务的完成。
    会议认为，阜新市经验的可贵之处，是找到了一条用少量车皮运输大量物资的重要途径。阜新市路矿大协作是政治挂帅和贯彻“全国一盘棋”思想的产物。通过整风运动，路矿双方都本着“保证重点，服务生产，加速车辆周转”的原则，在思想统一、产运销统一、运输组织机构统一的基础上，把路矿各个环节拧成一根绳。并通过大搞群众运动的方法，发动群众开展技术革命，创造了数十种平行交叉作业的先进操作方法，全面改革了技术作业过程，工序从原来的十一道简化为五道。同时，在“以煤保钢”的号召下，阜新全市人民大力支援装车卸车，形成了全市范围的大协作高潮。从去年10月到今年3月，在设备增加很少的情况下，运输效率翻了一番。一次作业时间（空车到达车站到装满煤炭发出），从十一点六小时缩短到五点八小时。
    由于密切协作和高度的统一指挥，群众创造了缩短一次作业时间的法宝——组织“红旗列车”。五个月来，阜新车站共开出“红旗列车”五百九十列，这对阜新和沿途各编组站缩短作业时间，提高车辆周转率，起了决定性的作用。
    代表们一致认为：煤炭生产和铁路运输有着相互依赖，相互促进的关系。阜新市路矿双方由于正确地处理了这个关系，行动一致，加上有了比较彻底的体制改革和深入的群众运动，有力地促进了煤炭生产和铁路运输的双跃进。
    今年，煤炭运输约占整个铁路运输任务的40％，认真推广阜新市的经验，有十分重要意义。会议要求各地大力推广阜新路矿协作的经验，保证货车一次作业时间较1958年压缩三分之一以上；煤炭净载重增加二吨；开出的直达列车增加一倍。这样，就可以不要任何投资，每天可为国家增加七千辆车的设备能力。铁路运输服务对象多，协作关系错综复杂。因此，会议认为，阜新市煤炭运输大协作的经验有着普遍的意义，这个经验不仅适用于煤炭运输，全国各地厂、矿、站、港之间，地区之间的运输部门都可以加以学习推广，以便把运输潜力充分挖掘出来。
    这次会议是铁道部、煤炭部和辽宁省人民委员会联合召集的。会议从4月6日开始到12日结束。参加会议的有二十二个省、市铁路局和煤炭局的代表。国家计划委员会、经济建设委员会和冶金部也都派代表出席了会议。
    参加这次现场会议的代表在会议结束前，向全国铁路煤矿全体职工发出路矿一条心，向时间要车，向协作要车，多运煤，快运煤的倡议书，掀起一个学阜新，赶阜新，超阜新的竞赛。
