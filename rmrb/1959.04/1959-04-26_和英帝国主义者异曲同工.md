To the Editor:

    A handful of Indian Congress Party leaders have brazenly and nonsensically referred to Tibet as a "nation," and have repeatedly made a big fuss over the Tibetan rebellion to defame China. This is enough to show what kind of medicine the expansionists in India are selling behind the so-called "Tibetan independence." It goes without saying that they are singing the same tune as British imperialists in their ambition to invade Tibet, and their purpose is to inherit the mantle of British aggression against Tibet. We advise those "politicians" to be more sensible and not to let their expansionist ambitions cloud their minds.

    China's internal affairs brook no foreign interference. If they insist on meddling, they will inevitably suffer a bloody nose and their reputation will be ruined.

    一小撮印度野心家救不了一小撮西藏叛国贼
    和英帝国主义者异曲同工编辑同志：
    印度国大党的一些领袖们竟信口雌黄地公然把西藏说成是“国家”，一再借西藏叛乱事件大作文章，诽谤中国，这足以说明目前印度的扩张主义分子们在叫嚣所谓“西藏独立”背后卖的是什么药。无须点破，它们和英帝国主义侵略西藏的野心是异曲同工，其目的是要继承英国侵略西藏的衣钵。我们奉劝那些“政治家”们，放明智些，不要被扩张的野心冲昏头脑。
    中国人民的内政，决不许外国人干涉。如果它们一定要伸手干涉，势必要碰的头破血流，名声一败涂地。
