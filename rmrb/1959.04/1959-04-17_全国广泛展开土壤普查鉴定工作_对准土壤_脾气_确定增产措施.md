Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The mass soil survey and identification work, focusing on cultivated land, which is being carried out across the country, has played a significant role in promoting production and providing a strong basis for the specific implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, in conjunction with the Land Utilization Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, recently jointly convened a soil survey work reporting meeting of fifteen provinces (regions) and cities, where representatives from various regions exchanged rich experiences in combining soil survey work with production, especially with current production.

The mass soil survey and identification work was widely launched after the National Soil Survey Work On-site Conference held in Xinxing County, Guangdong Province, in November of last year. As of now, two provinces have completed the work entirely, five provinces and cities have basically concluded it, thirteen provinces (autonomous regions) and cities are comprehensively carrying it out, and six provinces (autonomous regions) are conducting pilot work.

At the meeting, various regions cited many vivid examples illustrating how soil survey work starts with production, ends with production, and plays a significant role in current agricultural production, which is welcomed by the masses of farmers. For example, the Hongqi People's Commune in Xinxing County, Guangdong, using the results of soil survey and identification, deeply plowed and fertilized all 74,000 mu of paddy fields, improving the soil and achieving a bumper harvest of nearly 2,000 jin per mu of late rice last year. In Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, a piece of land originally planted three seasons a year with rice, corn, and spring flowering crops. In recent years, it was changed to planting early rice, late rice, and spring flowering crops, but the yield was not high. Through soil survey, it was found that this was river channel soil, with large sand content and low fertility, and there was little rain and insufficient water sources in autumn, so it was not suitable for planting the new three crops and was changed back to the old three crops. In recent years, Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, has expanded tea gardens, but many of the tea trees planted every year do not grow well and even wither in patches. Through this survey, it was discovered that this was because the seedlings were planted on alkaline land that was not suitable for tea tree growth, so the tea gardens were moved to acidic soil areas. After conducting soil survey and identification, Kaifeng Prefecture, Henan Province, planned the planting areas and acreage of grain crops and industrial raw material crops, and also planned the routes of large-scale shelterbelts, orchard areas, pastures, and fishing areas, so as to achieve planting according to local conditions, rational utilization of land, and promotion of the comprehensive development of agricultural production.

Various regions closely combined soil survey and identification work with current production. For example, Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, proposed "five combinations," namely, combining soil survey and identification work with field management to eliminate Class III seedlings; combining spring sowing work to check whether the seeds and seedling field area are correct, whether the layout and stubble are correct, and whether the indicators and measures are correct; combining the manure accumulation campaign to achieve self-sufficiency in natural fertilizers, soil fertilizers, and grass pond mud; combining the rectification of the commune to check the implementation of the "three guarantees and one reward" system; and combining the repair of farm tools to check the number of farm tools. The Baimao Commune in Changshu County put forward the slogan "Where soil survey goes, production promotion goes," and in two days, they surveyed the soil of summer harvest crop fields and found 997 mu of Class III seedlings. Cadres immediately convened a mass meeting and put forward specific measures to eliminate Class III seedlings.

In the process of soil survey, various regions have also discovered many sources of fertilizer. Guangdong Province has found a large amount of peat and more than 100 kinds of wild green manure. Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces have also found many peat. Zhejiang Province has also found various fertilizer sources such as phosphate and potash mines. The Hongxing Commune in Acheng County, Heilongjiang Province, found a large amount of peat through soil survey. At that time, more than 100 people were dispatched every day to dig and more than 30 large trucks were used to transport it. In pastoral areas in Gansu, ancient sheep manure was found, accumulated to several meters thick; the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also found piles of ancient cow, horse, and camel manure.

Carrying out soil survey and identification work also provides a basis for the establishment and improvement of the production responsibility system and the strengthening of operation and management of communes. Through soil survey, the commune clarified the fertility, irrigation, and drainage conditions of each cultivated land, enabling the production team to evaluate production targets and determine measures according to different soil conditions. For example, through soil survey, Zhejiang has more rationally promoted contracting work, contracting production, and contracting costs, making the commune's operation and management more meticulous.

The participating representatives unanimously believed that soil survey starts with production and ends with production, and conversely, current production has raised many new issues for soil survey, requiring soil survey work to be more in-depth and meticulous.

### 全国广泛展开土壤普查鉴定工作  对准土壤“脾气”确定增产措施

　　全国广泛展开土壤普查鉴定工作
　　对准土壤“脾气”确定增产措施
    新华社16日讯　全国各地正在进行的以耕地为主的群众性土壤普查鉴定工作，对促进生产起了显著的作用，为具体执行农业“八字宪法”提供了有力的依据。中国农业科学院会同农业部土地利用局最近联合召开了十五省（区）市的土壤普查工作汇报会，各地代表交流了土壤普查工作结合生产尤其是结合当前生产的丰富经验。
    群众性的土壤普查鉴定工作是去年11月在广东新兴县举行全国土壤普查工作现场会议后广泛开展起来的。截至目前为止，全部完成的有两个省，已基本结束的有五个省、市，正在全面开展的有十三个省（自治区）、市，正在进行试点工作的有六个省（自治区）。
    会上各地列举了许多鲜明的事例，说明土壤普查工作从生产入手，落脚于生产，在当前农业生产中起到了很大的作用，受到农民群众的欢迎。例如广东新兴县红旗人民公社运用土壤普查鉴定的成果，把七万四千多亩稻田全部深耕、施肥，改良了土壤，使去年晚稻获得了亩产近两千斤的大丰收。浙江兰溪县有一片地原来每年种水稻、玉米、春花作物等三季，近年改为种早稻、晚稻、春花三季，但产量不高。通过土壤普查，摸清这里是河沟土，砂性大，肥力低，并且秋季雨少，水源不足，因此不宜种新三熟，便仍然改为老三熟。江苏江宁县近年来扩大茶园，但是年年种植的茶树有许多长的不好，甚至成片枯萎。通过这次普查，发现这是由于把树苗种在不宜于茶树生长的碱性土地上了，便把茶园移到酸性土壤的地区。河南开封专区进行土壤普查鉴定后，规划了粮食作物和工业原料作物的种植区和面积，又规划出大型林带的线路、果树区、牧场、渔区等，作到了因地种植，合理利用土地，促进了农业生产的全面发展。
    各地在进行土壤普查鉴定工作中，紧密地结合了当前的生产。如江苏兴化县提出了“五结合”，即在进行土壤普查鉴定工作时，结合田间管理消灭三类苗；结合春播工作，查种子与秧田面积是否对头，布局与茬口是否对头，指标与措施是否对头；结合积肥运动，做到自然肥料，土化肥，草塘泥自给；结合整社工作，检查“三包一奖”制的执行情况；结合整修农具，检查农具数字。常熟县白茆公社提出“土壤普查到哪里，生产促进到哪里”的口号，两天中普查了夏收作物田的土壤，并查出三类苗九百九十七亩，干部立即召开群众大会，提出了消灭三类苗的具体措施。
    在土壤普查过程中，各地还发掘出许多肥源。广东省查出了大量泥炭和一百多种野生绿肥。江苏、浙江等省也查出许多泥炭。浙江省还查出磷矿、钾矿等多种肥源。黑龙江省阿城县红星公社通过土壤普查找出了大量的泥炭，当时每天就出动了百多人挖，三十多辆大车运送。甘肃在牧区查出了古羊粪，堆积达几公尺厚；内蒙古自治区也查出古牛、马、骆驼粪堆。
    进行土壤普查鉴定工作，还为公社建立和健全生产责任制、加强经营管理提供了依据。通过土壤普查，公社弄清了每块耕地的肥瘦、灌溉、排水等条件，使生产队能够根据土质条件的不同，评定产量指标和确定措施。如浙江通过土壤普查，更合理地推行包工、包产、包成本，使公社经营管理更加细致。
    与会代表一致认为，土壤普查从生产入手落脚于生产，反过来当前的生产又对土壤普查提出了许多新的问题，需要土壤普查工作做的更深入更细致。
