    Print Photos Better
    Many photos published in the People's Daily over the past few years have been very clear and beautiful, and everyone likes them very much. Some comrades even regularly cut them out and put them together into collections, so that every time they browse through them, they can vividly see the constantly changing face of the motherland. Recently, the photos published in the People's Daily include some that are very good, but some are not so clear and bright, and even very blurry. I don't know what the reason is, please try to improve it.

    把照片印得更好些
    人民日报过去几年来登的许多照片非常清晰美观，大家很喜爱。有的同志还经常剪贴下来，订成集子，每当翻阅的时候，就很形象地看到祖国不断改变着的面貌。最近人民日报上登的照片有很好的，但也有一些不是那么清晰明快，甚至很模糊。不知是什么原因，请设法改进。
