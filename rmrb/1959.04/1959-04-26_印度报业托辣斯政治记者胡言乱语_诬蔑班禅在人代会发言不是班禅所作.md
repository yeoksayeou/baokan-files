Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: The Indian Press Trust, India's largest news agency, published a commentary on the 23rd, attributed to its political reporter in New Delhi. This commentary baselessly claimed that the speech given by the Panchen Erdeni at the National People's Congress was not delivered by him, and it desperately tried to conceal the facts of the Indian expansionists' outrageous sabotage of Sino-Indian friendly relations.

The commentary stated that the Panchen Lama spoke at the Chinese National People's Congress today. But it also said, "It is impossible that the Panchen Lama made this statement."

The commentary desperately denied Panchen Erdeni's accusations against the Indian expansionists. It said that observers in New Delhi "do not attach importance to the Panchen Lama's accusation that the Indian government has expansionist ambitions in Tibet, believing that this accusation has no content." The commentary insisted on the already debunked false claim that the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" was written by himself.

The commentary said, "It is noted here that since the Dalai Lama fled Lhasa, Beijing has consistently said that he left his homeland under 'duress' and implicitly accused India of drafting the statement issued by the Dalai Lama in Tezpur after arriving in this country." But the commentary, apart from citing the second so-called Dalai Lama's statement issued in Mussoorie, was unable to provide any factual basis to deny that the statement was imposed on the Dalai Lama by others.

The commentary said, "Political observers here note with great regret that Sino-Indian relations have deteriorated due to the recent events in Tibet." But the author of the commentary did not explain how the Tibetan rebellion, a purely Chinese internal affair, could worsen relations between China and India.

The commentary avoided mentioning the attacks on China by some Indian politicians and newspapers regarding the Tibetan rebellion, and said, "India has never interfered in the relationship between Tibet and China as has been said." It said, "India has enough problems of its own to solve."

This commentary by the Indian Press Trust's political reporter in New Delhi was published immediately after Panchen Erdeni accused the Indian expansionists at the Chinese National People's Congress.

The commentary concluded by saying, "Well-informed sources here emphasized the importance of maintaining good relations between India and China, and said that nothing should be allowed to hinder the continuation of this relationship." It said, "The Indian government has strongly declared that the Dalai Lama cannot exercise any secular powers during his stay in India. Despite the statement made by the Panchen Lama, it seems that this policy will continue."

    印度报业托辣斯政治记者胡言乱语
    诬蔑班禅在人代会发言不是班禅所作
    新华社24日讯　印度最大的通讯社印度报业托辣斯在23日发表了注明是它驻新德里的政治记者写的一篇评论。这篇评论诬蔑班禅额尔德尼在全国人民代表大会上的发言不是他发表的，并且竭力掩饰印度扩张主义者放肆破坏中印友好关系的事实。
    这篇评论说，班禅喇嘛今天在中国全国人民代表大会发了言。但是它又说“发表这个声明的不可能是班禅喇嘛”。
    这篇评论竭力否认班禅额尔德尼对印度扩张主义者的指责。它说，新德里的观察家“不重视班禅喇嘛关于印度政府对西藏存在扩张野心的指责，认为这种指责是没有内容的。这篇评论坚持早已被揭穿了的关于所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”是他本人所写的虚伪说法。
    评论说，“这里注意到，自从达赖喇嘛逃出拉萨以来，北京一直说，他是在‘劫持’下离开他的本土的，并且意在言外地指责印度草拟了达赖喇嘛到这个国家后在提斯浦尔发表的声明”。但是评论除了引述在穆索里发表的第二个所谓达赖喇嘛的声明外，没有能提出任何事实根据来否定这个声明是别人强加于达赖喇嘛的事实。
    这篇评论说，“这里的政治观察家十分遗憾地注意到，由于最近西藏的事件，印中关系恶化了。”但是评论的作者没有解释西藏叛乱事件这个纯属中国内政的问题，怎么就会使中印两国的关系恶化起来。
    这篇评论对印度某些政治家和一些报刊就西藏叛乱事件对中国的攻击避开不谈，而说，“印度对西藏同中国的关系从来没有像所说的那样进行过任何干涉。”它说，“印度自己要解决的问题是够多的”。
    印度报业托辣斯驻新德里的政治记者的这篇评论是紧接着班禅额尔德尼在中国全国人民代表大会上对印度扩张主义者提出了指责之后发表的。
    评论最后说，“这里的消息灵通人士着重指出了印度和中国之间保持良好关系的重要意义，并且说，不应当让任何东西妨碍这种关系继续下去”。它说，“印度政府曾经极力宣布，达赖喇嘛在印度期间不能行使任何世俗的职权。尽管班禅喇嘛发表了这个声明，看来这个政策将继续下去。”
