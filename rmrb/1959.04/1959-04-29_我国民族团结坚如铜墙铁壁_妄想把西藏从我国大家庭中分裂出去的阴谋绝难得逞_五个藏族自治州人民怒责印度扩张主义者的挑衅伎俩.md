Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 28th April: Tibetan people in Sichuan Province have been holding rallies in recent days, angrily opposing the crude interference in China's internal affairs by Indian expansionist elements.

At a rally of more than 4,000 people in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, So Kuanying (Tibetan), Deputy Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, said: "I denounce the Tibetan rebels who betrayed the interests of the Tibetan people, and oppose the interference in our internal affairs by imperialists and foreign reactionaries with great indignation. I firmly believe that with the support of the people of the whole country, the Tibetan people will live a new democratic and happy life just like us." Gu Longhai (Tibetan), a member of the CPPCC Autonomous Prefecture, said: "For many years, the Tibetan people of the whole country, including Tibet, have lived in one big family with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland. The imperialists and Indian expansionist elements clamor for 'Tibetan independence' with the aim of splitting the big family of our people of all ethnic groups. We must completely smash this conspiracy!" Mao Gaisangdeng (Tibetan), Deputy Director of the Culture and Education Department of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, also cited historical facts of the Tibetan people's firm opposition to imperialist aggression in a recent speech. He said: "Even today, we Tibetan people are still proud of this. The Tibetan rebels collude with Indian expansionist elements, but fantasize about splitting Tibet from the big family of the motherland. This is a dream that will never be realized."

People in Heishui, Maerkang and other counties in the prefecture have also expressed their determination to counter the interference with practical actions. At the rallies of the Benzeng and Muzhu People's Communes in Maerkang County, Tibetan commune member Ke Ke·Sanlangham emotionally compared his life before and after liberation. Before liberation, about one-third of the Tibetan people in Maerkang begged along the road, and almost every month someone starved to death. Now, the per-mu yield of grain in the county has increased from dozens of kilograms to more than 300 kilograms, and some have reached more than 1,000 kilograms. The Tibetan people are living a life of plenty. He said: I really hope that the people of the whole country and the world know how much we Tibetan people love the Chinese Communist Party and how much we love the socialist road to prosperity and happiness under the leadership of the Party. The Indian expansionists' attempt to split our motherland will forever be a dream.

Ganze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

Zhe Yangdanzeng (Tibetan), Vice Chairman of the CPPCC of the Ganze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, who once studied Buddhism in Lhasa, also used his personal experience in his recent speech to illustrate that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can people of all ethnic groups live a truly happy life. He said: I personally witnessed the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Tibetan working people by the upper-level reactionary clique in Tibet. I know that the vast majority of Tibetan people love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao very much. I firmly support Premier Zhou's report. Only by gradually carrying out reforms in Tibet can the Tibetan working people live a happy life. We will never allow Indian expansionist elements to interfere in our internal affairs!

Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 28th April: People of all ethnic groups in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province have held rallies and forums to severely condemn the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements for supporting the Tibetan rebellion in an attempt to split our unified country.

Dan Dele (Tibetan), Governor of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, said at a forum held on the afternoon of the 27th: I have lived for sixty-seven years, and I have never heard of Tibet being an "independent country." According to Tibetan historical records, Tibet has had close political, economic and cultural ties with the mainland of the motherland for more than a thousand years. Tibet is a part of China, and this fact cannot be denied by anyone.

Now the Indian expansionist elements say that Tibet and India are in a "mother-child relationship," which is a completely shameless act of creating rumors and sowing discord. We warn these people with ulterior motives that Tibet is Chinese territory, and the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is purely an internal affair of China, and no country has the right to interfere. Ji Houtaiben (Tibetan), a member of the CPPCC of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, warned the Indian expansionist elements: The Chinese people are not to be bullied. If the Indian expansionist elements insist on acting recklessly, they will surely suffer a shameful defeat! Ka Maojie (Tibetan), Deputy Director of the Women's Federation of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, used her personal experience to describe the happy life that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao brought to the Tibetan people. She said: In the old society, our whole family worked as long-term laborers for the landlord, and we not only did not get paid, but we often did not have enough to eat. Compared with the past, today's life is simply heaven and hell. The Indian expansionist elements vainly attempt to split our Tibetan people from the big family of the motherland. It is completely a pipe dream.

The people of all ethnic groups in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are even more indignant at the arrogant behavior of the Indian rioters who insulted the portrait of our leader Chairman Mao. Wang Sanwei, a sixty-three-year-old doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, said angrily: Chairman Mao is the most beloved leader of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Insulting our great people's leader is absolutely intolerable.

Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 28th April: Workers, peasants, herdsmen, students and people from all walks of life in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu Province have held rallies in recent days to condemn the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements for interfering in our internal affairs, and strongly protest against the serious provocation of the Indian rioters insulting our leader.

The people of all ethnic groups in Gannan were extremely angry after hearing the news that the Indian rioters had publicly insulted the portrait of Chairman Mao. Dan Jicao, a Tibetan commune member of the Hongqi People's Commune, said excitedly: Chairman Mao led the people of all ethnic groups to turn over and become masters. He is the sun for the people of all ethnic groups. Insulting our leader is a provocation to our 650 million Chinese people. This is something we will never tolerate.

Yang Danzhu, Standing Director of the Buddhist Association of China, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of Gansu Province, and Vice Chairman of the CPPCC Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Committee, said: Our country is a multi-ethnic country, and Tibet is Chinese territory. This is a fact recognized by the people of the world. The so-called "Tibetan independence" is just the old trick of the imperialists. It is really foolish for the Indian expansionist elements to inherit the mantle of the imperialists. Yang Danzhu finally said indignantly: The imperialists and Indian expansionist elements have miscalculated. The despicable provocation and malicious alienation will not shake the close unity and unity of all ethnic groups in our country. On the contrary, this unity and unity is as consolidated and strong as a bronze wall.

Tibetan workers from the Gannan Dairy Factory and Tibetan, Hui, and Salar commune members from the Hongqi and other People's Communes angrily stated that Tibet is Chinese territory, and it is a matter of course for the Chinese people to exercise sovereignty on their own territory. No one is allowed to interfere.

Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 28th April: Monks and lay people in the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province solemnly refute the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements for interfering in our internal affairs.

Ji Fu (Tibetan), Governor of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and He Deshun (Tibetan), Deputy County Chief of Deqin County of the Autonomous Prefecture, cited historical facts about the flesh-and-blood relationship between Tibet and the motherland, and denounced the vicious remarks of the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements on the Tibet issue of our country. They said that calling Tibet a "country" is a serious provocation to the brotherhood between our Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups. Zhao Baohe (Tibetan), the white-haired Deputy Governor, was extremely indignant at the heinous crimes of the traitorous group and the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements who supported them. He said: I have been to Lhasa, Heihe and many other areas, and I have personally seen the very painful life of the Tibetan people. The imperialists and Indian expansionist elements support the traitorous group in an attempt to make the Tibetan people unable to turn over forever. This is something that the vast majority of Tibetan people resolutely cannot agree to.

More than 400 lamas from the Diqing Guihua Temple, one of the thirteen major temples in the Kang Tibetan area, recently held a meeting to angrily refute the ambitions of the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements. The elderly Bira Zhishi Lama, who has studied scriptures in Tibet for many years and has a good understanding of Buddhist scriptures, said that Tibet has been a part of China since ancient times. I have lived for so long and have never heard of Tibet being an "independent country." Quenu Tianmu, one of the main lamas of the Guihua Temple, said: It is clear that the traitors are carrying out rebellion in the name of religion, but the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements slander the Communist Party and our government for destroying religion. The Wannian Lamp in our Guihua Temple burns all year round, and believers can freely worship Buddha and chant scriptures, but the rebels almost burned to death a living Buddha in our autonomous prefecture. It was only because the People's Liberation Army arrived in time that they rescued him from the brink of death. Only the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements would describe the rebellion launched by these scum of Buddhism as being for the protection of religion.

    我国民族团结坚如铜墙铁壁
    妄想把西藏从我国大家庭中分裂出去的阴谋绝难得逞
    五个藏族自治州人民怒责印度扩张主义者的挑衅伎俩
    阿坝藏族自治州
    新华社成都28日电　四川省藏族人民连日来纷纷举行集会，愤怒反对印度扩张主义分子粗暴地干涉我国内政。
    在阿坝藏族自治州四千多人的集会上，自治州副州长索观瀛（藏族）说：“我以非常愤慨的心情，声讨出卖藏族人民利益的西藏叛匪，反对帝国主义和外国反动派干涉我国内政。我深信，在全国人民支援下，西藏人民一定会和我们一样，过着民主幸福的新生活。”自治州政协委员古龙海（藏族）说：“多少年来，包括西藏在内的全国藏族人民，同祖国各民族人民，就是生活在一个大家庭里的。帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子叫嚣什么“西藏独立”，其目的在于分裂我国各族人民的大家庭，对于这个阴谋，我们要彻底加以粉碎！”自治州人民委员会文教处副处长毛盖桑登（藏族）在最近的谈话中，还举出西藏人民曾经坚决反对帝国主义侵略的历史事实。他说：“直到今天，我们藏族人民还为此感到自豪。西藏叛乱分子与印度扩张主义分子勾结，却妄想把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去，这是永远不能实现的梦想。”
    这个州的黑水、马尔康等县人民也纷纷表示要以实际行动反击干涉者。在马尔康县本增、木足两个人民公社的集会上，藏族社员柯可·三朗哈姆激动地对比了解放前后的生活。解放前，马尔康有三分之一左右的藏民沿路求乞，几乎每月有人饿死。现在，全县粮食亩产已从几十斤增加到三百来斤，有的达千斤以上。藏族人民已过着丰衣足食的生活。他说：我真希望让全国和全世界人民知道，我们藏族人民多么热爱中国共产党，多么热爱在党领导下走繁荣幸福的社会主义道路。印度扩张主义分子妄图分裂我们祖国，永远是个梦想。
    甘孜藏族自治州
    曾经在拉萨研究佛学的甘孜藏族自治州政协副主席哲央丹增（藏族），在最近的发言中，也用亲身体会说明，只有在共产党和毛主席领导下，各族人民才能过真正幸福的日子。他说：我亲眼看见西藏上层反动集团对西藏劳动人民的残酷压迫和剥削。我知道，西藏广大人民都万分热爱共产党和毛主席。我坚决拥护周总理的报告，只有在西藏逐步进行改革，西藏劳动人民才会过幸福的生活。印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政，我们决不能容许！
    海南藏族自治州
    新华社西宁28日电　青海省海南藏族自治州各族人民纷纷集会座谈，严厉谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子支持西藏叛乱企图分裂我国统一的阴谋活动。
    海南藏族自治州州长丹德尔（藏族）在27日下午举行的座谈会上说：我已经活了六十七岁，从来也没有听说过西藏是什么“独立的国家”。根据藏族的历史记载，早在一千多年前西藏就和祖国内地有着密切的政治、经济、文化联系，西藏是中国的一部分，这个事实是谁也没法抹煞的。
    现在印度扩张主义分子却说西藏和印度是“母子关系”，这完全是一种造谣挑拨的无耻行为。我们警告这些别有用心的人，西藏是中国的领土，平定西藏叛乱纯系中国内部的事情，任何国家都无权干涉。海南藏族自治州政协委员吉后太本（藏族）警告印度扩张主义分子说：中国人民不是好欺侮的，如果印度扩张主义分子硬要蛮干下去，一定遭到可耻的失败！海南藏族自治州妇女联合会副主任卡毛杰（藏族），用亲身经历叙述了共产党和毛主席给藏族人民带来的幸福生活。她说：在旧社会我们全家给地主当长工，不但得不到工资，连饭也经常吃不饱。今天的生活和过去相比，简直是一在天堂，一在地狱。印度扩张主义分子竟妄想把我们藏族人民从祖国大家庭中分裂出去，完全是白日做梦。
    海南藏族自治州各族人民对印度暴徒侮辱我国领袖毛主席像的狂妄行为，更是无比愤慨。六十三岁的中医王三畏气愤地说：毛主席是我国各民族人民最敬爱的领袖，对我国伟大人民领袖进行侮辱，这是绝对不能容忍的。
    甘南藏族自治州
    新华社兰州28日电　甘肃省甘南藏族自治州各民族工人、农民、牧民、学生和各界人士，连日来纷纷集会，斥责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政，并强烈抗议印度暴徒侮辱我国领袖的严重挑衅。
    甘南各族人民群众听到印度暴徒公然侮辱毛主席像的消息后，无比愤怒。红旗人民公社藏族社员旦吉草激动地说：毛主席领导我们各族人民翻了身，他老人家是我们各民族人民的太阳，对我们领袖的侮辱，就是对我们六亿五千万中国人民的挑衅，这是我们绝不能容忍的。
    中国佛教协会常务理事、甘肃省佛教协会副会长、政协甘南藏族自治州委员会副主席杨丹珠说：我国是一个多民族的国家，西藏是中国的领土，这是全世界人民公认的事实。所谓“西藏独立”，只不过是帝国主义惯用的鬼蜮伎俩，印度扩张主义分子继承帝国主义的衣钵，实在是愚蠢的。杨丹珠最后愤慨地说：帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的算盘打错了，卑鄙的挑拨和恶毒的离间，不但不会动摇我国各民族亲密无间的团结统一，相反地，这种团结和统一更像铜墙铁壁一样的巩固坚强。
    甘南乳品厂的藏族职工，红旗等人民公社的藏族、回族、撒拉族社员愤怒地表示：西藏是中国的领土，中国人在自己的领土上行使主权，是天经地义的，决不允许任何人干涉。
    迪庆藏族自治州
    新华社昆明28日电　云南省迪庆藏族自治州僧俗人民严正驳斥帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政。
    迪庆藏族自治州州长吉福（藏族）、自治州德钦县副县长和德顺（藏族）列举历史上西藏和祖国的血肉关系的事实，痛斥帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子关于我国西藏问题的恶毒言论。他们说，把西藏称为“国家”，是对我们藏族人民和各族人民兄弟关系之间的严重挑拨。白发苍苍的副州长赵宝鹤（藏族）对叛国集团的滔天大罪和支持他们的帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，极为愤慨。他说：我到过拉萨、黑河等许多地区，亲眼看到藏族人民过着十分痛苦的生活。帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子支持叛国集团，就是企图使西藏人民永远不能翻身，这是广大藏族人民所坚决不能答应的。
    康藏地区十三大寺之一的迪庆归化寺四百多喇嘛最近集会，愤怒驳斥帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的野心。年老的比拉支使喇嘛曾经在西藏学经多年，对佛教经义有研究，他说，西藏从古以来就是中国的一部分，我活了这么大年纪从来没有听到过西藏是个“独立国家”。归化寺主要喇嘛之一却怒天姆说：明明是叛国分子盗用宗教的名义进行叛乱，帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子却污蔑共产党和我国政府破坏宗教。我们归化寺的万年灯终年不灭，信徒们能自由拜佛念经，而叛乱分子却几乎把我们自治州的一位活佛用火烧死，由于解放军及时赶到才把他从半死中救活了。只有帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子才把这些佛教里的败类所发动的叛乱，说成是为了保护宗教。
