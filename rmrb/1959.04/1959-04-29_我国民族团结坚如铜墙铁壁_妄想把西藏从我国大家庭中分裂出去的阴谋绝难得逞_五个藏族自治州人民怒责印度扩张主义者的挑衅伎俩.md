Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 28th April: Tibetan people in Sichuan Province have been holding rallies in recent days, angrily opposing the crude interference in China's internal affairs by Indian expansionist elements.

At a rally of more than 4,000 people in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, So Kuanying (Tibetan), Deputy Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, said: "I denounce the Tibetan rebels who betrayed the interests of the Tibetan people, and oppose the interference in our internal affairs by imperialists and foreign reactionaries with great indignation. I firmly believe that with the support of the people of the whole country, the Tibetan people will live a new democratic and happy life just like us." Gu Longhai (Tibetan), a member of the CPPCC Autonomous Prefecture, said: "For many years, the Tibetan people of the whole country, including Tibet, have lived in one big family with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland. The imperialists and Indian expansionist elements clamor for 'Tibetan independence' with the aim of splitting the big family of our people of all ethnic groups. We must completely smash this conspiracy!" Mao Gaisangdeng (Tibetan), Deputy Director of the Culture and Education Department of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, also cited historical facts of the Tibetan people's firm opposition to imperialist aggression in a recent speech. He said: "Even today, we Tibetan people are still proud of this. The Tibetan rebels collude with Indian expansionist elements, but fantasize about splitting Tibet from the big family of the motherland. This is a dream that will never be realized."

People in Heishui, Maerkang and other counties in the prefecture have also expressed their determination to counter the interference with practical actions. At the rallies of the Benzeng and Muzhu People's Communes in Maerkang County, Tibetan commune member Ke KeÂ·Sanlangham emotionally compared his life before and after liberation. Before liberation, about one-third of the Tibetan people in Maerkang begged along the road, and almost every month someone starved to death. Now, the per-mu yield of grain in the county has increased from dozens of kilograms to more than 300 kilograms, and some have reached more than 1,000 kilograms. The Tibetan people are living a life of plenty. He said: I really hope that the people of the whole country and the world know how much we Tibetan people love the Chinese Communist Party and how much we love the socialist road to prosperity and happiness under the leadership of the Party. The Indian expansionists' attempt to split our motherland will forever be a dream.

Ganze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

Zhe Yangdanzeng (Tibetan), Vice Chairman of the CPPCC of the Ganze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, who once studied Buddhism in Lhasa, also used his personal experience in his recent speech to illustrate that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can people of all ethnic groups live a truly happy life. He said: I personally witnessed the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Tibetan working people by the upper-level reactionary clique in Tibet. I know that the vast majority of Tibetan people love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao very much. I firmly support Premier Zhou's report. Only by gradually carrying out reforms in Tibet can the Tibetan working people live a happy life. We will never allow Indian expansionist elements to interfere in our internal affairs!

Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 28th April: People of all ethnic groups in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province have held rallies and forums to severely condemn the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements for supporting the Tibetan rebellion in an attempt to split our unified country.

Dan Dele (Tibetan), Governor of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, said at a forum held on the afternoon of the 27th: I have lived for sixty-seven years, and I have never heard of Tibet being an "independent country." According to Tibetan historical records, Tibet has had close political, economic and cultural ties with the mainland of the motherland for more than a thousand years. Tibet is a part of China, and this fact cannot be denied by anyone.

Now the Indian expansionist elements say that Tibet and India are in a "mother-child relationship," which is a completely shameless act of creating rumors and sowing discord. We warn these people with ulterior motives that Tibet is Chinese territory, and the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is purely an internal affair of China, and no country has the right to interfere. Ji Houtaiben (Tibetan), a member of the CPPCC of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, warned the Indian expansionist elements: The Chinese people are not to be bullied. If the Indian expansionist elements insist on acting recklessly, they will surely suffer a shameful defeat! Ka Maojie (Tibetan), Deputy Director of the Women's Federation of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, used her personal experience to describe the happy life that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao brought to the Tibetan people. She said: In the old society, our whole family worked as long-term laborers for the landlord, and we not only did not get paid, but we often did not have enough to eat. Compared with the past, today's life is simply heaven and hell. The Indian expansionist elements vainly attempt to split our Tibetan people from the big family of the motherland. It is completely a pipe dream.

The people of all ethnic groups in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are even more indignant at the arrogant behavior of the Indian rioters who insulted the portrait of our leader Chairman Mao. Wang Sanwei, a sixty-three-year-old doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, said angrily: Chairman Mao is the most beloved leader of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Insulting our great people's leader is absolutely intolerable.

Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 28th April: Workers, peasants, herdsmen, students and people from all walks of life in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu Province have held rallies in recent days to condemn the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements for interfering in our internal affairs, and strongly protest against the serious provocation of the Indian rioters insulting our leader.

The people of all ethnic groups in Gannan were extremely angry after hearing the news that the Indian rioters had publicly insulted the portrait of Chairman Mao. Dan Jicao, a Tibetan commune member of the Hongqi People's Commune, said excitedly: Chairman Mao led the people of all ethnic groups to turn over and become masters. He is the sun for the people of all ethnic groups. Insulting our leader is a provocation to our 650 million Chinese people. This is something we will never tolerate.

Yang Danzhu, Standing Director of the Buddhist Association of China, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of Gansu Province, and Vice Chairman of the CPPCC Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Committee, said: Our country is a multi-ethnic country, and Tibet is Chinese territory. This is a fact recognized by the people of the world. The so-called "Tibetan independence" is just the old trick of the imperialists. It is really foolish for the Indian expansionist elements to inherit the mantle of the imperialists. Yang Danzhu finally said indignantly: The imperialists and Indian expansionist elements have miscalculated. The despicable provocation and malicious alienation will not shake the close unity and unity of all ethnic groups in our country. On the contrary, this unity and unity is as consolidated and strong as a bronze wall.

Tibetan workers from the Gannan Dairy Factory and Tibetan, Hui, and Salar commune members from the Hongqi and other People's Communes angrily stated that Tibet is Chinese territory, and it is a matter of course for the Chinese people to exercise sovereignty on their own territory. No one is allowed to interfere.

Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 28th April: Monks and lay people in the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province solemnly refute the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements for interfering in our internal affairs.

Ji Fu (Tibetan), Governor of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and He Deshun (Tibetan), Deputy County Chief of Deqin County of the Autonomous Prefecture, cited historical facts about the flesh-and-blood relationship between Tibet and the motherland, and denounced the vicious remarks of the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements on the Tibet issue of our country. They said that calling Tibet a "country" is a serious provocation to the brotherhood between our Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups. Zhao Baohe (Tibetan), the white-haired Deputy Governor, was extremely indignant at the heinous crimes of the traitorous group and the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements who supported them. He said: I have been to Lhasa, Heihe and many other areas, and I have personally seen the very painful life of the Tibetan people. The imperialists and Indian expansionist elements support the traitorous group in an attempt to make the Tibetan people unable to turn over forever. This is something that the vast majority of Tibetan people resolutely cannot agree to.

More than 400 lamas from the Diqing Guihua Temple, one of the thirteen major temples in the Kang Tibetan area, recently held a meeting to angrily refute the ambitions of the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements. The elderly Bira Zhishi Lama, who has studied scriptures in Tibet for many years and has a good understanding of Buddhist scriptures, said that Tibet has been a part of China since ancient times. I have lived for so long and have never heard of Tibet being an "independent country." Quenu Tianmu, one of the main lamas of the Guihua Temple, said: It is clear that the traitors are carrying out rebellion in the name of religion, but the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements slander the Communist Party and our government for destroying religion. The Wannian Lamp in our Guihua Temple burns all year round, and believers can freely worship Buddha and chant scriptures, but the rebels almost burned to death a living Buddha in our autonomous prefecture. It was only because the People's Liberation Army arrived in time that they rescued him from the brink of death. Only the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements would describe the rebellion launched by these scum of Buddhism as being for the protection of religion.
