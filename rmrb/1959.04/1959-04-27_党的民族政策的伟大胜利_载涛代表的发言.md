    The Great Victory of the Party's Nationalities Policy
    Speech by Representative Zai Tao
    I fully agree with the various reports of the conference. In particular, Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report gave me great inspiration and made me feel extremely excited. I wholeheartedly support it and am determined to study the important contents of this report carefully, and to do everything in my power to realize this magnificent 1959 national economic plan.
    Now I would like to talk about two points I have gained from this conference:
    1. We are in an era where the East wind prevails over the West wind. The great achievements and rapid progress made on all economic fronts in 1958 have truly produced astonishing miracles. Taking steel production alone, under the Party's comprehensive leap forward leadership with steel as the key link, our steel production increased from 5.35 million tons in 1957 to 11.08 million tons. This is indeed something that the capitalist system could never possibly do. Britain's coal production is now far behind us. The imperialists, who are rotting away day by day, are shocked by our reality, which is getting better and better every day, and slander us, but the more the enemy clamors, the more it proves that we are getting better. Premier Zhou said, "Is such a growth rate something that the capitalist world has ever had? Let the Western bourgeois gentlemen clamor, our workers and peasants have lost nothing except the freedom to be unemployed and hungry."
    I feel happy to be born in this great era and proud to be a great Chinese citizen.
    All these great achievements are inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party, which further strengthens my confidence in always following the Party.
    2. Tibet has always been an inseparable part of our motherland. This time, a small group of rebels in Tibet wanted to undermine the unity of our motherland and the solidarity of our nationalities, which is extremely infuriating. However, the Tibetan rebellion has promoted the rapid realization of national regional autonomy in Tibet and the gradual implementation of democratic reforms. It also shows that the Tibetan people will henceforth break away from the dark and backward serf system and achieve democratic autonomy, making the Tibetan region a paradise on earth, which is something to be rejoiced and encouraged.
    I believe that this is another great victory achieved by the Party in its nationalities policy.
    I am a member of a minority nationality. Under the Party's great nationalities policy and Chairman Mao's meticulous care, our Manchu nationality has completely shaken off the discrimination, exclusion, and anonymous life we suffered before liberation. Now, in the warm family of the motherland, we are living an increasingly prosperous life, which makes me feel the greatness and correctness of the Party's leadership over minority nationalities.
    In the future, we must further unite around the Party, strengthen our ideological transformation, strengthen our position, contribute our strength to socialist construction, and greet the great tenth anniversary of the National Day with practical actions in the future.

### 党的民族政策的伟大胜利  载涛代表的发言

    党的民族政策的伟大胜利
    载涛代表的发言
    我完全同意大会的各项报告。特别是周恩来总理的政府工作报告，给了我以极大的启发，使我感到万分兴奋，我衷心拥护并决心要好好学习这项报告的重要内容，要为实现这一雄伟的一九五九年国民经济计划，尽到我能够尽到的一切力量。
    现在我想谈一谈我在这次大会中所得到的两点认识：
    一、我们是处在东风压倒西风的时代，一九五八年在经济各个战线上所获得的伟大成就和突飞猛进，真是出现了惊人的奇迹。单从钢的生产一项来说，在党的以钢为纲的全面跃进领导下，我们钢的产量由一九五七年的五百三十五万吨增长到一千一百零八万吨，这的确是资本主义制度绝对不可能做到的事情。英国的煤产量现在已远远落在我们后边。处在一天天烂下去的帝国主义，对着我们一天天好起来的现实，感到震惊，对我们进行诬蔑，但是敌人越叫嚷，越证实我们是更加好起来。周总理说：“这样的增长速度难道是资本主义世界有过的吗？让西方资产阶级的老爷们叫嚷吧，我们的工人和农民除了失去了失业和挨饿的自由以外，什么也没有失掉”。
    我觉得能生逢这一伟大时代而感到幸福，能是一个伟大的中国公民而感到骄傲。
    所有这一切伟大成就，都是和党的正确领导分不开的，因此，更进一步加强了我永远跟着党走的信心。
    二、西藏历来就是我们祖国的一部分，这次西藏一小撮叛乱分子想要破坏我们祖国统一和民族的团结，真是令人愤恨已极，但是西藏叛乱事件发生，反而促进了迅速实现西藏民族地方自治和逐步进行民主改革，同时也说明西藏人民将从此脱离了黑暗落后的农奴制度，而实现民主自治，西藏地区成为人间乐园，这是值得欢欣鼓舞的事。
    我认为这又是党在民族政策上所获得的伟大胜利。
    我是一个少数民族，我们满族在党的伟大民族政策和毛主席的无微不至的关怀下，完全摆脱了解放前那种受歧视排挤和隐姓埋名的生活，现在在祖国温暖的大家庭里，度着日益欣欣向荣日子，使我感到党对少数民族领导的伟大和正确。
    今后定要进一步团结在党的周围，并加强自己的思想改造，坚定立场，为社会主义建设贡献自己力量，并将今后的实际行动来迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
