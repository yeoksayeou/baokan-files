Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 23rd. The Cambodian "Unity Newspaper" said on the 22nd that Tibet is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China, and the Tibetan rebellion is China's internal affair. Those countries that adopt a non-interference attitude believe that China should be allowed to handle this issue itself.

This newspaper pointed out that the Tibetan rebellion was incited by imperialists. It said, "The Free World" is hypocritically clamoring about the Tibetan rebellion. Some people are trying to raise this issue in the United Nations; some are barking on radio stations or in newspapers, as if the Tibetan incident will immediately destroy the world. But these people do not care about the life and death of mankind.

The newspaper concluded that Tibetan affairs are China's internal affairs and should be allowed to handle it according to its own interests. Let the imperialists shout themselves hoarse, but the Asian and African countries will win their independence.

    柬埔寨“统一报”揭露
    帝国主义煽动西藏叛乱
    新华社金边23日电　柬埔寨“统一报”在22日说，西藏是中华人民共和国的一个自治区，西藏叛乱事件是中国的内政。那些采取不干涉态度的国家认为应该让中国自己去处理这个问题。
    这家报纸指出西藏叛乱是帝国主义者煽动起来的。它说，“自由世界”正在伪善地就西藏叛乱事件进行叫嚷。有人企图在联合国中提出这个问题；有人在电台上或者报纸上狂吠，好像西藏事件马上就会毁灭世界似的。但是这些人却不关心人类生死存亡的问题。
    这家报纸最后说，西藏事务是中国的内政，应该让它根据它自己的利益去处理。让帝国主义者叫喊得声嘶力竭，但是亚非国家一定会赢得它们的独立。
