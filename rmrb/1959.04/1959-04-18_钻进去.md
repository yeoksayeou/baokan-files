　　Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" long ago: "Serious tasks of economic construction lie before us. Some of the things we are familiar with will soon be laid aside and we will be compelled to do things with which we are unfamiliar." "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we do not understand." How to learn? Comrade Mao Zedong also said: "Dig into it for several months, a year or two, three or five years, and you can always learn it."
　　"Dig in and learn what you don't understand!" This has become the most important battle cry of our party in the past decade. We have consistently implemented this slogan and have never slacked off. Batch after batch of officers and soldiers took off their military uniforms and left the battlefield. Batch after batch of comrades working in other positions left their familiar departments and embarked on new combat posts that they may never have seen or even thought of before: factories, mines, construction sites, transportation departments, and various other economic work departments. Unfamiliar? Unaccustomed? Difficult? Of course, it is unfamiliar, unaccustomed, and full of difficulties. But this is entirely expected and not surprising. Relying on the will and perseverance of Communist Party members, relying on Marxism-Leninism, a universally applicable weapon, and relying on our party's consistent tradition of close ties with the masses, our comrades diligently study and move forward.
　　What is the result? The progress is different. Some comrades take a shorter time, a few months, a year or two, while some comrades take a longer time, three or five years, or even longer, but eventually they dig in, from not understanding to understanding, from understanding little to understanding more, to understanding even more, and learn what they don't understand. Our country has developed rapidly with this process. We have built the foundation of modern industry almost from scratch, and our agriculture has achieved tremendous development. In particular, in 1958, we doubled the output of steel, coal, grain, cotton, and other major industrial and agricultural products in one year, creating an unprecedented record. Most importantly, after this not-so-long ten years of practice, especially the great practice of 1958, our party finally dug out the general line of socialist construction, and also dug out a whole set of policies for realizing this general line.
　　"Dig in and learn what you don't understand." This is a thorough dialectical materialist slogan. On the one hand, we admit that we do not understand new things, admit that there is a contradiction between the objective reality of running the economy well and our subjective understanding, and admit that this is a difficulty. But on the other hand, we also believe that contradictions can be transformed. As long as we give full play to people's subjective initiative, we can certainly overcome difficulties, transform from not understanding to understanding, and from not knowing how to run the economy to knowing how to run the economy. In the past, since our comrades could transform from ordinary workers, peasants, or students into military strategists who were well versed in strategy, why can't generals and soldiers now transform into economic builders who are knowledgeable about the economy? The key lies in highly developing subjective initiative and striving to learn under new conditions. To learn how to run the economy, you cannot learn from the sidelines, but should learn in the process of running it. The conclusion, of course, is: dig in!
　　Things are always developing. New things are surging like a spring tide, and things we are not familiar with are placed before us one after another, waiting for us to solve them. Therefore, "dig in and learn what we don't understand" will never be outdated. We have made great achievements in digging in the past ten years. It is believable that we will dig in even better and achieve even greater results in the next ten years.

    毛泽东同志早在“论人民民主专政”一文中就提出：“严重的经济建设任务摆在我们面前。我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。”“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”怎么学法呢？毛泽东同志还说：“钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”
    “钻进去，学会自己不懂的东西！”成为我们党十年来最重要的战斗口号。我们始终如一地执行着这个口号，从来也没有懈怠过。一批又一批的军官和战士，脱下了军装，离开了战场，一批又一批在其他岗位上工作的同志们，离开了原来熟悉的部门，走上了新的、也许从前见也没有见过甚至想也没想过的战斗岗位：工厂、矿山、建筑工地、交通部门以及其他种种经济工作部门。生疏么？不习惯么？困难么？当然生疏、不习惯，而且困难重重。但这完全是意料之中的，不足为怪。凭着共产党员的意志和毅力，凭着马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的武器，凭着我们党的密切联系群众的一贯传统，我们的同志刻苦地钻研着，前进着。
    结果如何呢？进度不一样。有的同志时间短些，几个月、一年两年，有的同志时间长些，三年五年，甚或更长一些，但终究钻进去了，由不懂到懂，由懂的不多到懂的较多、到懂的更多，学会了自己不懂的东西。我们的国家，随着这个过程迅速地发展了。我们几乎是在空地上建起了现代工业的基础，我们的农业得到了巨大的发展。尤其是1958年，我们用一年的时间，使钢、煤、粮、棉以及其他工农业主要产品的产量翻了一番，创造了前无古人的最高纪录。最重要的是，经过这并不算长的十年的实践，特别是1958年这一年伟大的实践，我们党终于钻出了社会主义建设的总路线，并且钻出了实现这个总路线的一整套方针。
    “钻进去，学会自己不懂的东西。”这是一个彻底的辩证唯物主义的口号。一方面，我们承认自己不懂新的东西，承认在办好经济这个客观事物同我们主观认识之间存在着矛盾，承认这是一个困难。但是另一方面，我们又认定矛盾可以转化，只要充分发挥人的主观能动性，就一定可以打倒困难，由不懂变懂，由不会办经济变为会办经济。过去，既然我们的同志能够由一个普通的工人、农民或学生，变成一个深谙韬略的军事家，为什么现在不能由一个将军、战士变成一个通晓经济的建设者呢？关键就在于高度发扬主观能动性，努力在新的条件中学。要学会办经济，就不能在旁边学，而应该在办的过程中学。结论当然是：钻进去！
    事物永远在发展。新事物春潮般地汹涌而来，我们不熟悉的东西一个又一个地摆在我们面前，等待我们去解决。因此，“钻进去，学会我们不懂的东西”，也就永远不会落后。过去十年我们钻得很有成绩，可以相信，今后十年我们将钻得更好，成绩更大。
