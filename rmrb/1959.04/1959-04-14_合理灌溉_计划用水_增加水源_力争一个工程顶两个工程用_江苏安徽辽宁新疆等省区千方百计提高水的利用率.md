    Rational Irrigation　Planned Water Use　Increase Water Sources
    Striving for One Project to Serve as Two
    Jiangsu, Anhui, Liaoning, Xinjiang and Other Provinces and Regions are Doing Everything Possible to Improve Water Utilization Rates
    Repair One Well, Manage One Well, Use One Well

    Nanjing, April 13 (Report). In the water conservancy construction movement, Jiangsu Province is universally strengthening the management of completed and newly built projects, in accordance with the principle of "equal emphasis on construction and management, equal emphasis on development and consolidation," so as to ensure that existing engineering facilities fully exert their benefits in spring sowing and summer sowing crops.
    Through several years of water conservancy projects and various irrigation facilities construction, Jiangsu Province has greatly developed. This year, the province's irrigated area will expand to more than 52 million mu. Therefore, Jiangsu Province regards managing and using completed and newly built irrigation facilities as one of the major measures to increase agricultural production. Last year, thanks to the strengthening of engineering and irrigation management work in various parts of the province, it played a significant role in ensuring increased agricultural production. Last year, each horsepower of water pump irrigated 70 mu, with the highest exceeding 300 mu; each flow of gravity irrigation irrigated 9,000 mu, with the highest exceeding 15,000 mu; and the area implementing planned water use was 10.1 million mu.
    In order to enable completed and newly built projects to further play a greater role in guaranteeing a greater harvest in agricultural production in 1959, Jiangsu Province has put forward a greater leap forward plan for engineering irrigation management in 1959. It requires that the existing irrigated area of more than 45 million mu and the newly developed irrigated area of 7 million mu this year should fully exert their benefits, further tap the potential of the project, so that each horsepower in the new and old electromechanical irrigation areas can irrigate and drain more than 120 mu of paddy fields, each flow in the gravity flow reservoir irrigation areas can irrigate and drain more than 12,000 mu of paddy fields, and the drought resistance capacity in the pond and well irrigation areas can be increased by more than 50% on the existing basis. In terms of water use management, the area implementing planned water use is required to reach more than 31 million mu, and the area of irrigated and cultivated garden land is required to reach more than 15 million mu. At the same time, irrigation technology should be improved, and the irrigation methods of shallow water and frequent irrigation, and furrow irrigation should be widely promoted. At present, we should especially pay close attention to wheat field irrigation and drainage and rice irrigation preparation work, so as to ensure that there is water for irrigation and drainage is complete when there is waterlogging.
    All parts of Jiangsu Province are taking various effective measures to implement the above-mentioned tasks and indicators of engineering irrigation management. In the electromechanical irrigation areas, the effective methods of "one machine dragging multiple pumps" and "changing iron pipes to wooden pipes" that were implemented last year are being universally promoted, so as to further improve the water lifting capacity of the machinery. Last year, the Baimao Irrigation Area in Changshu County adopted measures such as wooden pipe axial flow pumps and one machine dragging two pumps, which doubled the water output of the machines. This year, they also plan to further improve on the basis of the past, for example, changing the original hanging wooden pump to a wind tunnel type wooden pump, vigorously promoting one machine dragging three pumps, and at the same time merging inlets and repairing channels, so that the efficiency of the machine can be further increased by about 50% on the basis of the past.
    In the canal gravity irrigation areas, Jiangsu Province is fully utilizing large rivers and lakes to intercept and store irrigation water on the one hand, and vigorously carrying out canal renovation and reconstruction on the other hand, gradually achieving canal system engineering and reducing water transmission losses. Within this year, it is required to increase the effective utilization coefficient of the canal system to 0.6 to 0.8, so as to give full play to the role of water. In the pond and reservoir irrigation areas, we are vigorously strengthening water storage and conservation work, actively renovating projects and improving project quality. More than 60% of the 400,000 reservoirs and ponds in the hilly and mountainous areas of the province are currently full of water. Changzhou Prefecture, which has the most ponds and reservoirs, has 360,000 ponds that are generally storing about one meter of water.

    Improve Irrigation Methods　Reform Water Lifting Tools

    Shenyang, April 13 (Report). In order to ensure timely early planting, a farmland water conservancy construction movement centered on a sudden spring irrigation has been vigorously launched in various parts of Liaoning Province. By mid-March, the winter and spring irrigated area in the province had reached more than 1.8 million mu.
    In order to carry out rational irrigation and better exert the benefits of increasing production, various localities have also created many advanced irrigation experiences in spring irrigation. Fuxin Mongolian Autonomous County has relatively universally promoted the experience of "six-sided operation method" and "three simultaneous emphasis" in spring irrigation. The six sides are: repairing projects, repairing canals, leveling land, harrowing and compacting, making ridges, and irrigating at the same time; the three simultaneous emphasis are: equal emphasis on canal irrigation and well irrigation, equal emphasis on indigenous and foreign methods, and equal emphasis on quantity and quality. Due to the implementation of scientific irrigation methods, most of the more than 15,000 mu of land that has been irrigated in the county now meet the quality requirements. During spring irrigation, the Thirty Family Township in Lingyuan County, based on the topography of the area, has developed three different types of garden-style irrigation methods in plains, hills, and mountains, providing valuable experience for the province's large-scale garden-style movement.
    Various counties have also launched a reform movement of water lifting tools. After the successful reform of deep-water wheels in Heishan and Zhangwu counties, Kangping, Tieling, and other counties have recently created a combination of indigenous and foreign pumping machine that uses ropes to pull the machine to drive the pump. This pumping machine can lift 30 tons of water per hour, which is equivalent to the efficiency of a three-to-five-horsepower power machine. These two counties are now vigorously rushing to manufacture and promote them.

    Renovate Old Irrigation Areas to Expand Irrigated Areas

    Urumqi, April 13 (Report). In order to ensure a bumper harvest in agricultural and animal husbandry production this year, people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have launched a spring water conservancy movement centered on the reconstruction of canal systems within the communes.
    As of the end of March, Xinjiang has completed 58.32 million cubic meters of earth and stone work during the winter and spring seasons, and the area of renovated old irrigation areas has reached 5.98 million mu. Due to the completion of the above-mentioned projects, the expanded irrigated area has reached 1.76 million mu.
    At present, according to the situation that spring sowing is about to be fully launched, the party committees in various localities have decided to transfer the water conservancy army from large-scale water conservancy projects to the reconstruction projects of canal systems within the communes, so that water conservancy construction and the current spring sowing production are closely integrated.
    This work has been universally launched in various parts of Xinjiang recently. Aksu Prefecture in southern Xinjiang, which has basically completed the reconstruction project of the main old irrigation area, now has 50,000 to 60,000 people engaged in leveling land, renovating field canals and branch canals, and installing canal gates. The Yili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture in northern Xinjiang recently established a water conservancy work command to strengthen the leadership of this work. Among them, 40,000 people in each directly affiliated county have invested in the reconstruction project of the canal system within the society, striving to renovate 600,000 mu of old irrigation area this spring.
    While reconstructing the old irrigation areas within the communes, various localities have also grasped the irrigation management work. Many areas have begun to rectify and improve the water conservancy management committees at all levels, and have arranged and organized mass irrigation experiments, so that all land can not only be irrigated in a timely manner, but also be irrigated in an appropriate amount, avoiding the phenomenon of excessive irrigation in the past that wastes water and causes salinization of the land. After the Tazihong People's Commune in Shule County renovated the irrigation area of 80,000 mu of the old irrigation area, due to the reduction of many chaotic channels and the leveling of the ridges, it expanded 8,000 mu of land on the original cultivated land, which generally increased the number of irrigations for the original farmland by two times. In addition, it also newly increased the water demand of 4,500 mu of newly reclaimed land.

　　Spring Rain is as Precious as Oil　　Storing Water is Like Storing Grain

    Hefei, April 13 (Report). Various parts of Anhui Province are seizing the favorable opportunity of abundant spring rain to vigorously carry out a mass movement of water storage and conservation. According to statistics at the beginning of April, the total amount of water stored in the province is about 10 billion cubic meters, accounting for 72% of the volume of the province's existing water conservancy facilities of 15 billion cubic meters. The amount of water stored during this period can basically meet the water needs of early rice and other spring-sown crops this year.
    This year, in terms of water storage methods, in addition to storing water in large, medium, and small rivers, reservoirs, ponds, and other water conservancy facilities, various parts of Anhui have also created many new water storage methods. For example, some combine the drainage of summer harvest crop fields with diverting water into ponds; some raise the height of dikes and raise the water level; some open water diversion ditches and fill stagnant water ponds; and some use leisure fields and depressions to store water. In the spring water conservancy project construction, various localities also adopted measures such as simultaneous construction and water storage, and early water storage, which combine construction and storage. Therefore, the amount of water stored this year has greatly increased compared with previous years.
    While vigorously grasping water storage, various localities have established and improved management organizations at all levels to do a good job in water conservation. Lai'an County has established management committees for all 34 larger water conservancy projects in the county. There are 2,860 water conservancy workers in each people's commune in the county, and each production team has designated one to three people to be responsible for water conservancy work.
    Anhui Province has nearly 90 million mu of cultivated land. The Huaibei area, which accounts for half of the province's total cultivated land area, has uneven rainfall throughout the year, and there is often a lack of rain during the key period of crop water demand. The Huainan hilly area, which accounts for about one-third of the province's cultivated land area, is a drought-prone area. A major drought of 100 days without rain occurred last year. Therefore, it is as the broad masses said it is significant for Anhui to seize the favorable opportunity of abundant spring rain to vigorously carry out water storage and conservation work: "Storing water is like storing grain."

　　合理灌溉　计划用水　增加水源
　　力争一个工程顶两个工程用
　　江苏安徽辽宁新疆等省区千方百计提高水的利用率
　　修好一处　管好一处　用好一处
    本报南京13日电　江苏省各地在兴修水利运动中，根据“兴修与管理并重、发展与巩固并重”的方针，普遍加强对已建和新建工程的管理，做到修好一处、管好一处、用好一处，使现有工程设施在春播和夏播作物中充分发挥效益。
    江苏省经过几年来兴修的水利工程、各类灌溉设施有了很大发展，今年全省灌溉面积将扩大到五千二百万亩以上，因此江苏省把管好、用好已建和新建的灌溉设施作为农业增产的重大措施之一。去年，全省各地由于加强工程、灌溉管理工作，对保证农业增产起了很大作用。去年抽水机每马力的灌溉面积为七十亩，最高超过了三百亩；自流灌溉每个流量的灌溉面积为九千亩，最高超过了一万五千亩；实施计划用水面积为一千零一十万亩。
    为了使已建和新建各类工程在1959年进一步发挥对农业生产更大丰收的保证作用，江苏省对1959年工程灌溉管理工作又提出了更大跃进的规划。要求全省已有灌溉面积四千五百余万亩和今年新发展的灌溉面积七百万亩都充分发挥效益，进一步挖掘工程潜力，使新老机电灌区每马力灌排水稻面积达到一百二十亩以上，自流水库灌区每个流量灌排水稻面积达到一万二千亩以上，塘坝水井灌区抗旱能力在现有基础上提高50％以上，在用水管理上，实施计划用水的面积要求达到三千一百万亩以上，灌溉耕作园田化面积达到一千五百万亩以上，同时改进灌溉技术，普遍推广浅水勤灌和沟灌畦灌的灌溉方法。当前特别抓紧麦田灌排和水稻灌溉准备工作，做到要灌有水，涝来排尽。
    江苏省各地对上述工程灌溉管理工作的各项任务指标，正在切实地采取各种有效措施加以贯彻。在机电灌区普遍推行去年行之有效的一机拖多泵、铁管改木管等办法，以进一步提高机械的提水能力。常熟县白茆灌区去年采取木管轴流泵和一机拖双泵等措施，使机器出水量提高一倍，今年他们还计划在过去的基础上，进一步加以改进，例如将原挂拖式木泵改为风筒式木泵，大力推广一机拖三泵，同时合并车口、整修渠道，使机器效率能在过去基础上再提高50％左右。
    在渠道自流灌区，江苏省正一方面充分运用大河、大湖拦蓄灌溉水源，另一方面大力进行渠道整修改建，逐步做到渠系工程化，减少输水损失，在今年内要求将渠系有效利用系数提高到零点六至零点八，以充分发挥水的作用。在塘坝、水库灌区正在大力加强蓄水保水工作，积极整修工程、提高工程质量，全省丘陵山区的四十多万座水库塘坝，目前已有60％以上的塘坝水库蓄满了水。塘坝、水库最多的常州专区，三十六万座塘坝一般已蓄水一公尺左右。

　　改进灌溉方法　改革提水工具
    本报沈阳13日电　为了保证适时早种，一个以突击春灌为中心的农田水利建设运动已在辽宁省各地蓬勃展开。到3月中旬止，全省冬春灌面积已达一百八十多万亩。
    为了进行合理灌溉，更好地发挥增产效益，各地在春灌中还创造了许多先进的灌溉经验，阜新蒙古族自治县在春灌中比较普遍地推行了“六边作业法”和“三并重”的经验。六边是：边修工程、边修渠、边整地、边耙压、边作畦、边灌溉；三并重是：渠浇和井浇并重、土洋并重、数量质量并重。由于推行了科学的灌溉方法，全县现在已灌的一万五千多亩地，绝大部分合乎质量要求。凌源县三十家子乡在春灌中根据本地区的地形，在平原、丘陵、山地上搞出了三种不同类型的园田化的灌溉方法，为全省大搞园田化运动提供了宝贵的经验。
    各县还开展了提水工具改革运动。康平、铁岭等县继黑山、彰武改制深井水车成功以后，最近创造出一种用绳索牵引机带动水泵的土洋结合的抽水机。这种抽水机每小时可提水三十吨，和三到五马力动力机的效能相等。现在这两个县正在大力赶制、推广。
　　改建旧灌区扩大灌溉面积
    本报乌鲁木齐13日电　新疆各族人民为了确保今年农牧业生产大丰收，掀起了以公社内部渠系改建为中心的春季水利运动。
    截至3月下旬止，新疆在冬春季共已完成了土石方工程五千八百三十二万公方，改建的旧灌区面积已达五百九十八万亩，由于上述工程的完成，扩大的灌溉面积已达一百七十六万亩。
    目前，各地党委根据春播即将全面展开的情况，决定把水利大军从大型水利工程上转移到公社内部的渠系改建工程方面，使兴修水利和当前的春播生产密切结合起来。
    最近全疆各地已普遍展开了这一工作。南疆基本上完成了主要旧灌区改建工程的阿克苏专区，目前已有五、六万人投入了平整土地，整修田内毛渠、斗渠、安装水渠闸门的工作。北疆伊犁哈萨克族自治州最近还专门成立了水利工作指挥部，以加强这一工作的领导，其中各直属县已有四万人投入了社内渠系改建工程，争取在今春改建六十万亩旧灌区面积。
    各地在改建社内旧灌区的同时，还抓紧了灌溉管理工作，许多地区已开始整顿和健全了各级水利管理委员会，布置和组织了群众性的灌溉试验工作，使所有的土地不仅能适时灌溉，还要灌溉得适量，避免以往灌水过量既浪费水，又使土地发生盐碱化的现象。疏勒县塔孜宏人民公社改建了八万亩旧灌区的灌溉面积后，由于裁减了许多紊乱的渠道，平整了地埂，就在原来的耕地上扩大了八千亩土地，使原来农田的灌溉次数普遍增加了两次，另外，还新增加了四千五百亩新开荒地的需水量。

　　春雨贵似油　　屯水如屯粮
    本报合肥13日电　安徽省各地抓紧春雨多的有利时机，大力开展蓄水保水的群众性运动。到4月初统计，全省蓄水总量约达一百多亿公方，占全省现有水利设施的容积一百五十亿公方的72％。这一时期的蓄水量，已基本上可以满足今年早稻及其他春播作物用水的需要。
    安徽各地今年在蓄水方法上，除用大、中、小型河流、水库、塘坝等水利设施蓄水外，还创造了许多新的蓄水办法。如有的结合夏收作物田的抽沟沥水，引水入塘；有的加高坝埂，抬高水位；有的开引水沟，灌满死水塘；还有的利用休闲田、洼地蓄水。各地在春修水利工程中，还采用边兴修、边蓄水的修、蓄兼顾提早蓄水等措施，因此今年蓄水量比往年大为增加。
    各地在大抓蓄水时，都层层建立和健全了管理组织，做好保水工作。来安县全县三十四个较大水利工程都成立了管理委员会，全县各人民公社共有二千八百六十个水利员，每个生产队都划片固定一到三人，专管水利工作。
    安徽省耕地面积近九千万亩，占全省总耕地面积一半的淮北地区，常年降雨量不均匀，作物需水关键时期往往缺雨。占全省耕地面积约三分之一的淮南丘陵区，是个易旱地区，去年曾发生了百日无雨的大旱，因此当前安徽抓紧春雨多的有利时机大力进行蓄水保水工作，它的意义正如广大群众所说，是：“屯水如屯粮”。　　（李祥仁）
