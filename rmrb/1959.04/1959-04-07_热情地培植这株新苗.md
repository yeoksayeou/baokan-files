    Enthusiastically Cultivate This New Seedling
    By People's Daily Commentator
    At a recent creative symposium held by the Chinese Writers Association, when discussing children's literature, writer Zhang Tianyi conveyed the opinion of a counselor. This counselor said that he hoped the literary and art circles "wouldn't be too indifferent to children's literature." He emphasized the word "too," as if his request wasn't high; some indifference would be acceptable, just not too much.
    Although it’s just one word of criticism, it is worth the attention of comrades in literary and art circles.
    In September 1955, the People's Daily published an editorial on the issue of reading materials for children and young people; the Chinese Writers Association and its branches established measures; children's newspapers, periodicals, and publishing houses carried out extensive organizational work; professional and amateur authors enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and actively wrote. Since then, the shortage of reading materials for children and young people has greatly improved, and the cause of children's literature has taken a big step forward, with significant progress in both quantity and quality. However, in the great leap forward in literary and artistic creation since last year, has there been a phenomenon of indifference to children's literature (as well as children's theater, children's films, children's songs...)? If we seriously examine it, we probably cannot say there hasn't been. According to statistics from the China Children's Publishing House and the Shanghai Children's Publishing House, 448 kinds of children's books were published in the six months from April to October last year, of which only eleven were literary creations; among the 1,055 creative subjects reported by the branches of the Chinese Writers Association in various provinces and cities, only three were children's literature. Presenting these situations, comrades in literary and art circles will certainly feel the seriousness of the problem.
    Our era is precisely an era of surging heroic figures; our literary and art cause is also moving towards greater prosperity! The mass leaps forward of the whole people last year and this year have provided children's literature with an inexhaustible source of art, from which countless novels, fairy tales, dramas, films, and songs can be written! The rich and colorful lives of children and young people in the great leap forward, and their spirit of striving for progress every day, also provide a large number of brand-new subjects. The field of children's literature is originally very broad; today, it is even more promising, with extremely vast horizons. Are such extensive subjects and such a variety of categories not enough for literary and art workers with aspirations in this field to give free rein to their talents? The problem lies in paying more attention to the next generation and thinking more for the hundreds of millions of young readers. From pre-school babies to junior high school Young Pioneers, they are waiting with an eagerness "like clouds in a great drought." Once you think of this, who can fail to be moved!
    Precisely because of this, the current problems in children's literature are not only about quantity, but also about quality. Our young readers are not satisfied with simply knowing a simple fact; they want to find heart-stirring plots in books, to make a few close friends, to get to know characters who can become role models, to find scenes that they can never forget, and some even want to find the key to writing good compositions. In short, their requirements for a good literary book are diverse. Can our authors ignore these various requirements of young readers? Probably not. In the field of children's literature, we should also create excellent works worthy of our era, masterpieces that are inspiring and ignite children's enthusiasm for progress!
    Children's literature is a new seedling in our socialist literary cause. It needs more nutrition and more careful watering and cultivation. We hope that comrades in literary and art circles, as well as the vast number of teachers, counselors, and children's workers who are committed to this cause, can all be diligent and enthusiastic gardeners, so that this new seedling can blossom more brightly and bear more abundant fruit as soon as possible!

    热情地培植这株新苗
    本报评论员
    在中国作家协会最近举行的一次创作座谈会上，谈到儿童文学的时候，作家张天翼转达了一位辅导员的意见。这位辅导员说，希望文艺界“对儿童文学不要太冷淡”。他把太字念得很重，意思好像要求并不高，冷淡一些还可以，就是不要太冷淡。
    虽是一字之贬，但值得文艺界同志们注意。
    1955年9月，人民日报曾经为少年儿童读物问题发表过社论；中国作家协会和它的分会规定了措施；少年儿童报刊、出版社进行广泛的组织工作；专业和业余的作者们热情地响应党的号召，积极写作。从那以后，少年儿童读物奇缺的现象大有好转，儿童文学事业也向前迈进了一大步，无论在量和质的方面都有显著的进展。但是，在去年以来的文学艺术创作的大跃进里，是不是有对儿童文学（以及儿童戏剧、儿童电影、儿童歌曲……）冷淡的现象呢？如果认真检查一下，恐怕不能说没有。根据中国少年儿童出版社和上海少年儿童出版社的统计，去年4—10月六个月里出版了四百四十八种儿童读物，其中文艺创作只有十一种；中国作家协会收到的各省市分会报来的创作计划，在一千零五十五种创作题材中，儿童文学只有三种。把这些情况一摆，文艺界的同志们就一定会感到问题的严重性了。
    我们的时代，正是英雄人物风起云涌的时代；我们的文学艺术事业也正在走向更大更繁荣的路上！去年和今年的全民大跃进，给儿童文学提供了取之不尽、用之不竭的艺术源泉，可以写出多少小说、童话、戏剧、电影和歌曲！少年儿童在大跃进里的丰富多采的生活，他们的天天向上的劲头，也提供了大量的崭新的题材。儿童文学的领域，本来是十分宽广的；在今天，它更是前途似锦，有着极其辽阔的天地。题材那样广泛，品种那样繁多，还不够有志于此的文艺工作者们纵横驰骋吗？问题就在于更多地关心下一代，多为那亿万小读者着想。他们，从学龄前的娃娃到初中的少先队员，“若大旱之望云霓”，都在如饥似渴地等待着。一念及兹，谁能不怦然心动！
    正因为如此，当前儿童文学上的问题，还不只是数量，也还该提出质量的要求。我们的小读者并不满足于仅仅知道一件简单的事实，他们要想从书里去找扣动心弦的情节，去结识几个知心朋友，去认识足以成为学习榜样的人物，去找永远不能忘怀的情景，甚至还有人要去找写好作文的钥匙。总而言之，他们对一本好的文艺书籍的要求是多种多样的。而我们的作者能不能不顾到小读者们的这种种要求呢？恐怕是不能够的。在儿童文学领域里，我们同样应该创作出无愧于我们时代的优秀作品，创作出激动人心、燃烧起孩子们向上的热情的杰作！
    儿童文学是我们社会主义文学事业中一株新苗，它需要更多的营养，更细心的灌溉和培植，我们希望文艺界同志和有志于这事业的广大教师、辅导员和少年儿童工作者们，都能做辛勤、热情的园丁，让这株新苗早日开出更鲜艳的花，结出更丰硕的果！
