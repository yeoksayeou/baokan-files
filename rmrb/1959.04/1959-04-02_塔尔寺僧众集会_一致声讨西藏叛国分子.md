Xinhua News Agency, Xining, April 1st. Monks of the塔尔寺(Ta'er Monastery), the birthplace of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, and one of the six major monasteries of the Gelug school, warmly support the State Council's order on thoroughly quelling the Tibetan rebellion and dissolving the Tibetan local government, and unanimously condemn the towering crimes of the Tibetan reactionary clique in colluding with imperialism to carry out the rebellion.

　　After seeing the news of the rebellion by the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet, the monks of 塔尔寺(Ta'er Monastery) gathered to hold discussions.端主旦巴(Duānzhǔ Dànbā) Lama, who had been to Tibet after liberation, said: I personally saw that the People's Liberation Army is disciplined, safeguarding the interests of the Tibetan people everywhere, protecting the Lama monasteries, and respecting the religious beliefs and customs of the monks and lay people. However, a small group of traitors are plundering, burning, killing, and harming the people, committing all kinds of evil. Only by eliminating these scum of the Tibetan people can the Tibetan people embark on the road to prosperity and happiness.

　　夏格日(Xià Gé Rì) Living Buddha said: Although the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet has long dreamed of splitting the motherland, undermining national unity, and attempting to ride on the heads of the Tibetan people for a long time, they will never achieve this goal, because the vast majority of the Tibetan people love the motherland, love the Communist Party, and support the central government. The people of all ethnic groups in Tibet will unite more closely in the future, and the unification of the motherland will be more consolidated.昂旺银巴(Ángwàng Yínbā) Lama said: The Tibetan traitors presumptuously instigated a rebellion, which is their own way to self-destruction. All the monks in our temple must be vigilant and resolutely support the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion.

    塔尔寺僧众集会
    一致声讨西藏叛国分子
    新华社西宁1日电　喇嘛教黄教始祖宗喀巴诞生地、黄教六大寺院之一的塔尔寺僧众，热烈拥护国务院关于彻底平息西藏叛乱、解散西藏地方政府的命令，一致声讨西藏反动集团勾结帝国主义进行叛乱的滔天罪行。
    塔尔寺僧众在看到西藏上层反动集团进行叛乱的消息后纷纷集会座谈。解放后曾经去过西藏的端主旦巴喇嘛说：我亲眼看到人民解放军纪律严明，处处维护藏族人民利益，保护喇嘛寺庙，尊重僧俗人民宗教信仰和风俗习惯。而一小撮叛国分子却是劫掠烧杀、残害人民，无恶不作。只有清除这些藏族人民的败类，西藏人民才能走上繁荣幸福的道路。
    夏格日活佛说：西藏上层反动集团尽管长久以来妄想分裂祖国，破坏民族团结，企图长期骑在西藏人民头上；但是他们永远也达不到这个目的，因为广大西藏人民是热爱祖国、热爱共产党、拥护中央的。西藏各族人民今后会团结得更加紧密，祖国统一也将更加巩固。昂旺银巴喇嘛说：西藏叛国分子狂妄地策动叛乱，这是他们自己走上自取灭亡的道路。我们全寺僧众要提高警惕，坚决支持解放军平息叛乱。
