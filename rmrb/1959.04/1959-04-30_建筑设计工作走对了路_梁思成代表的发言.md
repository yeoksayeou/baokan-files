Fellow Representatives, Fellow Committee Members:

I completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian's reports, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's reports. The Premier's and the two Vice Premiers' reports are not just reports, they are heroic poems full of vigor. On the day after Premier Zhou made his report, weren't countless factories and mines across the country already responding to the call of the Party and the government by overfulfilling their daily production plans? The Party and the government have already entrusted us with the glorious tasks on the economic and cultural fronts for 1959. Without a doubt, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the glorious light of the General Line, we have the confidence to continue to leap forward on the basis of the great leap forward of 1958!

Tsinghua Architecture Department faculty and students, formerly "armchair strategists" with empty talk and lifelessness; now "real swords and guns" doing practical work, full of vitality

I am an architectural worker in Beijing and also a teacher in a higher education institution. I would like to take the Architecture Department of Tsinghua University as an example to talk about how the Party's principle of "education serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor" has been implemented in universities, leading to a great leap forward and a thorough revolution in teaching.

Since the nationwide readjustment of departments in 1952, we have worked hard to learn from the Soviet Union and strive for the combination of theory and practice. Although there has been great progress compared with before the readjustment, in general, the progress is still not enough. For quite a long time, we sought concrete tasks in urban planning and individual building design that were in progress from planning and design units in Beijing, as topics for our course design and graduation design. We also hired experienced architects from design units to serve as part-time design teachers. But after all, it was still "doing real questions in a fake way," still "armchair strategizing," so the students' designs could only remain at the stage of "castles in the air," all without practical testing.

In July 1958, after the great rectification movement, the anti-Rightist struggle, and a series of great debates on teaching and scientific research issues, we clarified the two lines in teaching, liberated our thinking, broke down superstitions, boldly started up, accepted national tasks, and started working with "real swords and guns."

In 1958, the Architecture Department of Tsinghua University, with the collaboration of fraternal departments such as Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering, undertook the design of several national key civil and industrial projects, planned twenty-seven small and medium-sized cities, eighteen counties and towns, and some people's communes in Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces, and also designed several individual buildings. The professional level and teaching quality of all faculty and students have been greatly improved, some major problems have been solved, and ideological gains have also been made. The entire department presented an unprecedented vigorous and new atmosphere.

Taking the masses as teachers, understanding their likes and dislikes, through production practice, architectural design work has found the right direction

In the past, the most difficult problem for us to solve was the issue of creative direction in architectural design. We took many detours. First, we held up the glass box of bourgeois modern architecture; later, after criticizing it, we turned around and embraced dougong brackets, glazed tiles, and large roofs; after two years of fussing, we criticized them and had to turn to Western classical forms; then the "Western wind" blew again, and many teachers returned to Western modern architecture. At the same time, at first, we only sought beauty and ignored the economy; then we turned around and one-sidedly emphasized the economy, not even daring to mention the word "beauty," for fear of being labeled with the "aestheticism" hat. In this way, like architects across the country, we fell into a dilemma, not knowing where to go. But the Party cared for us and taught us, through a series of criticisms and debates on architectural thought. Through production practice, we finally found the correct creative direction.

Since last July, in the design competitions for several key projects in Beijing, under the leadership of the Party, we mobilized the strength of all faculty and students, made some plans, and received some good comments; we also achieved some success in the planning and design of some people's communes. We gradually touched the direction, found some things, unlike in the past when we had no idea and groped blindly.

On the surface, this seems to be just a matter of form. But because "what is formed within manifests itself without," so at heart it is still a matter of understanding the essence of architecture. In the past, we only considered from the form, and failed to achieve the unity of content and form, so we ran into walls everywhere; none of this or that form was welcome. So this form problem is essentially a unity of content and form, a combination of experts and the masses, a unity of tradition and innovation, and a unity of practicality, economy, and aesthetics. In the great leap forward of 1958, due to putting politics in command, clarifying that architecture serves proletarian politics; under the leadership of the Party, taking the mass line, combining education with productive labor, the contradictions were correctly resolved, and finally comprehensively and concretely expressed in architectural form, and the masses were satisfied.

The problem can be solved, in the final analysis, the key lies in the leadership of the Party and the mass line. In our planning and design work, Premier Zhou, Comrade Peng Zhen, and many leaders of the Central Committee and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee have come to Tsinghua many times to see our designs and gave us many instructions. The Party Committee of Tsinghua University also regularly cares about us. In various cities, counties, and towns, the provincial, municipal, and county Party committees all lead our work in the same way.

From the specific work of some key projects in the capital, from the beginning, the Party pointed out that these tasks put politics first, and require "600 million people to design together" and to have a national style. We clarified that these projects serve politics and that we must take the mass line, and we felt excited, honored, and also realized the clear direction.

When accepting the task of planning and designing people's communes, we first realized that the new social organizational form of the people's commune is the germ of communist society. All the teachers and students who participated in the work thought about how to embody it in planning and architecture, and thought about what kind of ideological education and training this work would give us, so as soon as the task came down, we went all out with full enthusiasm. Under the leadership of the county party committee and the commune party committee, in the nearly five months of work in the commune, the teachers, students, and working people integrated their thoughts and feelings, and the gains were great.

For a long time, we have had the mistake of lacking a mass perspective, not being able to figure out what the masses need, but instead saying that the masses do not understand architecture, and insisting on stuffing the large roofs and square boxes that we love to them, and even thinking that we are educating the masses. But after we clarified who architecture serves, we conducted extensive investigations and interviews for each task. For example, in order to make the theater meet the needs of the people today, we interviewed Comrade Mei Lanfang and more than one hundred actors, musicians, and managers of various departments of theaters of all ages and genders in the capital. Students even guarded the toilets to count the number of people and usage during entry, rest, and dismissal. On artistic issues, we also asked the general public for advice, and took the design drawings everywhere to solicit opinions, from workers in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, members of the Sijiqing People's Commune, and even passengers on buses, we sought their opinions.

In terms of materials and technology, the gains we have learned from the masses are also extremely rich. For example, paint workers, glass workers, and glazed tile workers not only taught us the use of various materials, but also told us from the design perspective: what color is what effect under what kind of sunlight or shadow, what kind of decorative carved lines should be placed how high, how big, and how far, and how should they be handled, etc. These experiences are invaluable to us. Here I want to especially mention our representative from Beijing, Comrade Zhang Baifa, the national labor model youth commando captain who is present here. Last year, a class of students from our architecture department participated in his team as apprentices. Thanks to our master Zhang and other masters who taught our students with their communist style. When the students went, they were white-faced students "with no skills," and when they came back, they were all third-level workers who had mastered at least one type of work technology. Later, this class of students went to Xushui County, not only did the planning and architectural design of the commune, but also built commune houses with the commune members, and became masters themselves, training a large number of technicians for the Xushui Construction Corps (they were originally strong laborers who repaired reservoirs). Comrade Zhang Baifa not only taught his skills to our students, but also educated our students with his communist style. Now when the students talk about it, don't mention how much they love their master Zhang!

In last year's design work, we used the collective creation method of the mass line. Under the leadership of the Party, senior teachers, young teachers, students of all grades, and technical experts from all aspects were closely combined into a collective. As soon as the task came down, everyone first focused on the conceptual, then conducted separate investigations, research, collective discussions, and everyone proposed plans; teachers proposed plans themselves, and also guided students to make plans, discussed and compared with each other, and concentrated the advantages of each plan in a pragmatic way, gradually synthesized and tended to be perfect. When drafting, multiple methods were used at the same time, plus the "relay race," and in one day and night, drawings with large screens and relatively high quality were drawn.

When we first started doing this, some teachers were not used to it; some could not see the strength of the students, and some complained that the students were slow. But the facts educated them. Working alone or in small groups in a cold and quiet way is far inferior to collective creation, which can learn from each other's strengths and make excellent designs in a faster, better, and more economical way. These collective creations included not only the teachers and students of the architecture department, but also the broad masses of workers, peasants, and leading comrades of the Party. This embodies the spirit of "600 million people designing together."

Using the past for the present and things for human use to make architectural design work meet the needs of socialist construction

Such "real swords and guns" design work also promoted scientific research work. For example, the sound design of the theater has become quite enthusiastic. We not only investigated almost every theater in the capital and did instrument tests, but also conducted an "audience test" not long ago. In that test, more than a dozen different programs were performed, and more than a thousand spectators who came included men, women, old and young, different provinces, and people from all walks of life. When they entered the venue, each person received a "test paper," filled in their seat number, and filled in their reactions to the sound effects of various programs in their own seats. That was a very moving scientific research work in the style of a communist mass movement. That is only possible in our new society.

Now, we really feel that we cannot do without the masses. If any design does not solicit the opinions of the masses, it feels like a knot in our hearts.

In the past, many people, when designing, either confined themselves to the formal frameworks of various traditions or schools of thought from ancient times to the present, or let the so-called function and materials and structure determine the form of the building. But today we realize that we must use the past for the present and things for human use; we are the masters of old traditions and new materials and new technologies, not their slaves. We want to use all of this in our grasp to meet the needs of socialist construction and express the politics of New China and the spirit of our socialist era. It is precisely because we have some experience, have figured out the masses' likes and dislikes, made some things, and got the masses to nod. We have clarified that architecture serves politics, implemented the Party's educational policy and architectural design policy, and our creativity has been liberated and initially developed.

It is worth mentioning that, because teachers and students are together day and night, carrying out creative labor, intellectuals and workers and peasants are together, personally participating in physical labor, and a new comradeship between teachers and students, intellectuals and working people is gradually formed and developed, forming a new communist-style collective, cultivating new people in the communist style.

In other departments and majors of Tsinghua University, and in universities across the country, there are many examples like the Architecture Department of Tsinghua, I am only reporting to the representatives and committee members the initial achievements we have made in implementing the Party's education policy through this one example.

The Premier's report has put forward huge construction tasks for our architectural workers, instructing our school teachers "to arm workers, peasants, and intellectuals with the proletarian scientific revolutionary worldview, and eliminate the ideological influence of all exploiting classes; to make education serve the working people, to make culture controlled by the working people, and to combine mental and physical labor"; to make our "schools increasingly develop into a new type of school for cultivating communist new people"; and to make us "improve the quality of teaching as a regular basic task."

The Premier's call gave great encouragement to all teachers and students of Tsinghua University. In 1958, we had already begun to do so. This year, in the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, we will respond to the Party's call with more concrete actions. Every teacher will strive to study, constantly carry out self-transformation, constantly improve their business, and combine theory with the reality of socialist construction; actively participate in physical labor, and first transform themselves into a communist people's teacher. Under the leadership of the Party, through production labor and teaching practice, we will train our students to become engineers who are both red and expert, and gradually make Tsinghua University a new type of communist university.

I guarantee here to the beloved Party, to Chairman Mao, and to all representatives and committee members that not only the architecture department where I work, but also the entire faculty and staff of Tsinghua University, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Central Ministry of Education, will muster twenty-four points of energy, strive to go upstream, and under the glorious light of the General Line, respond to the Party's call with more and better production products and learning achievements and with more excellent graduates to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland!

Finally, I cannot restrain my indignation and must talk about the Tibet issue here. Since the Tibetan rebellion occurred, the expansionists of India, and even some responsible officials of the Indian government, have forgotten the "Five Principles" jointly advocated by China and India, and issued arrogant clamors, slandering and defaming our country, and rudely interfering in China's internal affairs. The situation has even developed to the point where officials of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs distribute the so-called "Declaration of the Dalai Lama" on behalf of the rebels, and further condone thugs to insult the image of our great leader Chairman Mao. Can the Indian government shirk its responsibility for such interference in China's internal affairs and for such extremely unfriendly barbaric acts?! More than two thousand architects and engineers in Beijing, hundreds of thousands of construction workers, and more than 14,000 faculty and staff of Tsinghua University are extremely angry and strongly protest against this despicable act and rude behavior. The Indian expansionists vainly attempt to inherit the mantle of their former master, the British imperialists, and the master and servant collude with each other, trying to interfere in China's internal affairs, so as to achieve their ulterior motives, which the Chinese people will never allow! We remind Prime Minister Nehru to pay attention, cherish the traditional friendship between China and India, and immediately stop all barbaric actions that damage Sino-Indian relations. We solemnly warn all Indian expansionists and agents of imperialism: Tibet is an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China; suppressing the Tibetan rebellion is 100% China's internal affair, and no foreign interference is allowed! If you dare to put your ugly pig's mouth into our fence, the 650 million Chinese people of all ethnic groups, especially the Tibetan people, will never let you go lightly!!!

### 建筑设计工作走对了路  梁思成代表的发言

专栏：

    建筑设计工作走对了路
    梁思成代表的发言各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告，和彭真副委员长和李维汉副主席的报告。总理和两位副总理的报告不仅仅是报告，它们都是干劲十足的英雄的诗篇。在周总理作了报告的第二天，全国无数厂矿不是已经以超额完成日生产计划来响应党和政府的号召了吗？党和政府已经给我们交代了一九五九年在经济战线和文教战线上的光荣任务。毫无疑问，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们有信心，一定能在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，继续跃进一大步！
    清华建筑系师生，过去“纸上谈兵”空谈，死气沉沉；现在“真刀真枪”实干，朝气勃勃
    我是北京市的一个建筑工作者，也是一个高等学校的教师，我愿意在这里以清华大学建筑系为例，谈谈在高等学校里是怎样贯彻执行了党所提出的“教育为工人阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，来了一个大跃进，在教学工作中来了一次彻底的大革命。
    自从一九五二年全国院系调整以来，我们努力学习苏联，努力求得理论与实际的结合，虽然比调整以前有了很大进步，但一般说来，进步还是不够的。我们在相当长的时间内，从北京市的规划设计单位讨来一些在城市规划和个别建筑物设计方面正在进行的具体任务，作为我们教学中课程设计和毕业设计的题目。还聘请了设计单位中富有经验的建筑师来兼任设计教师。但毕竟还是“真题假做”，还是“纸上谈兵”，所以学生的设计，只可能停留在“空中楼阁”的阶段，都是没有经过实际考验的。
    一九五八年七月，我们经过了伟大的整风运动、反右派斗争和一系列关于教学和科学研究问题的大辩论之后，明确了教学中的两条路线，解放了思想，破除了迷信，大胆上马，接受了国家任务，就“真刀真枪”地干起来了。
    在一九五八年中，清华大学建筑系，在土木、机械、电机等兄弟系的协作下，承担了国家的几项民用和工业重点工程的设计，在河北、山西等省做了二十七个中小城市、十八个县镇和一些人民公社的规划，还做了若干个个别建筑物的设计。全系师生的业务水平和教学质量有了很大的提高，解决了一些大问题，思想上也获得了丰收。整个系里呈现了前所未有的蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
    拜群众为师，摸群众爱恶，通过生产实践，建筑设计工作找到了正确方向
    过去我们最无法解决的问题就是建筑设计中的创作方向问题。我们走了不少弯路。先是把资产阶级现代建筑的玻璃方匣子捧出来；后来把它批判掉，一转身又抱着斗拱、琉璃瓦、大屋顶不放；闹了两年，把它批判掉了，只好转向西洋古典形式；接着“西风”又刮起来，许多教师又回到西方的现代建筑上去。与此同时，先是只求美观，不管经济；转过来又片面强调经济，连一个“美”字都不敢提，生怕戴上“唯美主义”的帽子。就这样，同全国的建筑师一样，我们陷入了一个左右为难，不知何所适从的境地。但是党关怀着我们，教导着我们，经过了一系列关于建筑思想的批判和辩论。通过生产实践，我们终于找到了正确的创作方向。
    去年七月以来，在北京的几项重点工程的设计竞赛中，在党的领导下，我们发动了全体师生的力量，做出一些方案，得到了一定的好评；在一些人民公社的规划设计中也取得了一定成绩。我们逐步摸到了方向，找到了一些东西，不像过去那样心中无数，瞎摸瞎碰了。
    从表面上看来，这好像仅仅是一个形式问题。但由于“成于中者形于外”，所以在骨子里还是一个对建筑本质的认识的问题。过去我们只从形式上考虑，未能做到内容与形式的统一，所以到处碰壁；这种、那种形式都不受欢迎。所以这个形式问题，本质上是一个内容与形式的统一，专家与群众的结合，传统与革新的统一，实用、经济与美观的统一的问题。在一九五八年的大跃进中，由于政治挂帅，明确了建筑为无产阶级政治服务；在党的领导下，走群众路线，把教育与生产劳动结合起来，正确地解决了这种种矛盾，最后综合地、具体地表现在建筑形式上来，得到了群众的满意。
    问题能够得到解决，归根结底，关键就在党的领导和群众路线。在我们的规划设计工作中，周总理、彭真同志以及中央和北京市委的许多位领导同志曾多次到清华来看我们的设计，给了我们许多指示。清华大学党委，更经常地关怀着我们。在各城市县镇，省、市、县委都同样地领导着我们工作。
    从首都某些重点工程的具体工作来看，一开始，党就指出这些任务是政治在先，要“六亿人民共同设计”，要有民族风格。我们明确了这些工程是为政治服务的，是要走群众路线的，我们感到兴奋、光荣，也体会到了明确的方向。
    在接受人民公社规划设计的任务的时候，我们首先意识到人民公社这个新的社会组织形式是共产主义社会的萌芽。全体参加工作的师生都想着怎样在规划和建筑中把它体现出来，想到这一工作将会给我们什么样的思想教育和锻炼，所以任务一下来，就干劲冲天地全力以赴。在县委和公社党委的领导下，我们在公社将近五个月的工作中，教师、同学和劳动人民思想感情打成一片，收获是很大的。
    长期以来，我们就存在着缺乏群众观点的错误，摸不清群众需要什么，反而说群众不懂建筑，硬要把我们所喜爱的大屋顶、方匣子塞给他们，还自以为要教育群众。但在我们明确了建筑为谁服务之后，我们对每一项任务，都先广泛地调查访问。例如要使剧场能符合今天人民的需要，我们就访问了梅兰芳同志以及首都百十来位男女老少的演员、音乐家和许多剧院的各部门的管理人员。学生们甚至守在厕所里统计入场、休息和散场时的人数和使用情况。在艺术问题上，我们也向广大群众请教，拿着设计图纸到处征求意见，从石景山钢铁厂的工人，四季青人民公社的社员，甚至在公共汽车上的乘客，都征求他们的意见。
    在材料、技术问题上，我们向群众学习的收获也极为丰富。例如油漆工人，玻璃工人，琉璃工人不但教会我们各种材料的使用技术，还从设计的角度告诉我们：什么颜色在什么样的阳光或阴影下是什么效果，什么样的装饰刻划的线条应当放在多高、多大、多远的地方，应当怎样处理等等。这些经验对我们都是如获至宝。在这里我要特别提到我们北京市的代表，在座的全国劳动模范青年突击队队长张百发同志。去年我们建筑系的一班学生，参加到他的队里当学徒，感谢我们的张师傅和其他师傅们，以他们的共产主义风格教导我们的同学，同学们去的时候是“无一技之长”的白面书生，回来的时候就都已经是各人掌握至少一种工种技术的三级工了。后来，这班学生到徐水县去，不但做了公社的规划和建筑设计，并且同社员们一道建造公社房屋，自己又成了师傅，为徐水建设兵团（他们原来都是修水库的壮工）培养了大批技术工人。张百发同志不但把他的技术教给我们的学生，而且以他的共产主义风格教育了我们的学生。现在同学们谈起来，甭提多么热爱他们的张师傅了！
    在去年的设计工作中，我们运用了群众路线的集体创作方法。在党的领导下，年长教师，青年教师，各年级的同学，各方面的技术能手，亲密地结合成一个集体。任务一下来，大家就先务虚，然后分别调查、研究，集体讨论，大家提方案；教师自己提方案，也指导同学作方案，互相讨论、比较，实事求是地集中了各方案的优点，逐步综合，趋于完善。制图的时候，就多管齐下，加上“接力赛跑”，一昼夜功夫，就画出画面很大而质量相当高的图纸来。
    刚开始这样做的时候，有些教师是不习惯的；有的看不见同学的力量，有的嫌同学慢。但事实教育了他们。一个人或少数人冷冷清清的搞，远不如集体创作，能取长补短，多快好省地做出出色的设计来。这些集体创作不仅是建筑系的师生，而且还包括了广大工人，农民以及党的领导同志。这正体现了“六亿人民共同设计”的精神。
    古为今用，物为人用，使建筑设计工作满足社会主义建设需要
    这样“真刀真枪”的设计工作还推动了科学研究工作。例如剧院的音响设计，就搞得颇为热烈。我们不但调查了首都的差不多每一个剧场，做了仪器测验，而且不久以前，还进行了一次“观众测验”。在那次测验中，表演了十几种不同的节目，请来的一千多位观众包括男女老少，不同省籍，各行各业的人。他们入场时每人领一份“考卷”，填上自己的座位号数，对于各种节目的音响效果逐项填了他们在自己座位上的反应。那是一场非常动人的共产主义风格群众运动方式的科学研究工作。那是只有在我们的新社会里才可能办到的。
    如今，我们真是感到离不开群众了。任何一个设计不征求群众的意见，心里就像生了一个疙疸一样。
    在过去，许多人在做设计的时候，不是把自己束缚在古今中外各种传统或流派的形式框框里，就是让所谓功能和材料、结构来决定建筑的形式。但是今天我们认识到，我们要古为今用，物为人用；我们是旧传统和新材料、新技术的主人，不是它们的奴隶。我们就是要这一切在我们的掌握中，运用它们来满足社会主义建设的需要，表达新中国的政治和我们社会主义时代的精神。正是因为我们有了一些体会，摸清了群众的憎爱，做出了一些东西，得到了群众点头。我们明确了建筑为政治服务，贯彻了党的教育方针和建筑设计的方针，我们的创造力就得到解放，初步发挥出来了。
    值得特别提到的是，由于师生一道，朝夕相处，进行创造性的劳动，知识分子与工农群众一道，亲自动手，参加体力劳动，先生和学生之间，知识分子和劳动人民之间的新的同志式的关系也逐渐形成和发展起来，形成了一种共产主义风格的新型集体，培养出来共产主义风格的新人。
    在清华大学的其他学系和专业里，以及在全国各高等学校中，像清华建筑系这样的实例是很多的，我仅仅是通过这一个例子，把我们贯彻党的教育方针所取得的初步成就向代表们、委员们汇报一下。
    总理的报告给我们建筑工作者提出了巨大的建设任务，指示我们学校教师“要用无产阶级的科学的革命的世界观来武装工人、农民和知识分子，扫除一切剥削阶级的思想影响；要使教育为劳动人民服务，要使文化为劳动人民所掌握，使脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合”；要我们的“学校日益发展成为培养共产主义新人的新型学校”；要我们把“提高教学质量作为一个经常的基本任务”。
    总理的号召给了清华大学全体师生莫大的鼓励。在一九五八年，我们已经开始这样做了。在今年，我们伟大祖国建国十周年的一年中，我们要以更多的具体行动来响应党的号召。我们每一个教师都将努力学习，不断进行自我改造，不断提高自己业务，使理论与社会主义建设的实际相结合；积极参加体力劳动，首先把自己改造成一个共产主义的人民教师。在党的领导下，通过生产劳动和教学实践，把我们的学生培养成为又红又专的工程师，使清华大学逐渐成为一个共产主义的新型大学。
    我在这里向亲爱的党、向毛主席保证，并且向各位代表、各位委员保证，不仅是我自己工作所在的建筑系，而且是整个清华大学的师生员工，将在北京市委和中央教育部的领导下，鼓足二十四分干劲，力争上游，在总路线的光辉照耀下，以更多更好的生产成品和学习成绩并且以更优秀的毕业生来响应党的号召，来迎接我们伟大祖国建国的十周年！
    最后，我不能抑制自己的愤慨，必须在这里谈谈西藏问题。自从西藏叛乱事件发生以来，印度的扩张主义者，甚至印度政府的一些负责官员，竟然忘记了中印两国共同倡导的“五项原则”，发出狂妄叫嚣，对我国进行诬蔑和诽谤，粗暴地干涉中国内政。事态甚至发展到由印度外交部官员代叛乱分子散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，更进一步纵容暴徒侮辱我们伟大领袖毛主席的像。这样干涉中国内政，对于这样极端不友好的野蛮行为，印度政府能推卸责任吗？！北京市的二千多建筑师、工程师，二十几万建筑工人，以及清华大学全体一万四千多师生员工万分愤怒，对这种卑鄙勾当和粗暴行为提出严重抗议。印度扩张主义者妄想继承他们过去的主子英帝国主义的衣钵，主子奴才狼狈为奸，想来干涉中国内政，从而达到他们那不可告人的目的，那是中国人民所绝不容许的！我们提醒尼赫鲁总理注意，珍惜中印两国的传统友谊，立刻制止一切损害中印关系的野蛮行动。我们严正地警告印度的一切扩张主义者和帝国主义的代理人：西藏是中华人民共和国不可分割的一部分；平息西藏叛乱是百分之百的中国内政，绝不容许任何外国干涉！假使你们胆敢把你那丑恶的猪嘴拱进我们的篱笆里来，六亿五千万中国各族人民、首先是西藏人民是绝不会把你们轻轻放过的！！！
