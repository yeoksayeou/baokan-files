Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 14th - The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a statement today on "African Freedom Day," pointing out that "African Freedom Day" symbolizes the common desire of all Africans for freedom, and calling on all peace-loving people around the world to take immediate and concrete measures to help the cause of African liberation.

The statement, in reviewing the rising tide of national independence movements in Africa, said, "This series of events shows that the African revolution cannot be isolated, and the struggles of all Africans are completely interconnected. The struggles in Nyasaland, Rhodesia, and Central Africa have recently reached a general climax." The statement said, "There is no doubt that these events demonstrate the true desire of Africa for freedom. The reaction of the imperialists clearly shows that they are truly afraid that Africa will no longer tolerate their evil system."

The statement revealed: "We see Britain proposing a plan to hand over political power in East and Central Africa to local Europeans. In Kenya, the British Colonial Office is forcibly implementing a constitution: transferring all power to 60,000 white immigrants and helping this small group enslave eight million Africans."

According to recently discovered documents, a new conspiracy has also been exposed. Immigrants, aided by the British government, are attempting to incite violence to assassinate all African nationalists. This document is an agreement concluded between the colonial governments of East and Central Africa to use force, if necessary, to stop African nationalism.

The statement continued that the current massacres and mass arrests of African nationalists cannot stop the struggle of Africans to win their inherent rights. The statement said that Africans are determined to fight for freedom and do not want to make any concessions to the enemies of African nationalism who live here.

The Secretariat believes that the general sentiment of Africans demanding liberation "requires special actions involving all peace-loving people around the world. The Secretariat believes that certain concrete measures should be taken immediately."

The statement called on the United Nations to reconsider its attitude towards colonies. The statement said, "In a world where the aspiration for freedom is boiling and people are still suffering under imperialist rule, the colonial issue is no longer an internal affair that can be resolved between the colonial people and the colonizers. The United Nations should establish a special committee to investigate the situation in various colonies."

The statement concluded that allowing colonies to continue to exist "is indeed a stain on the history of the modern world. Imperialism should be completely eliminated."

### 亚非人民团结理事会就“非洲自由日”发表声明  非洲人决心争取自由不对殖民者让步

    亚非人民团结理事会就“非洲自由日”发表声明
    非洲人决心争取自由不对殖民者让步
    据新华社开罗14日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天就“非洲自由日”发表的声明中指出，“非洲自由日”象征着全体非洲人要求自由的共同愿望，并且号召全世界爱好和平的人民立即采取具体措施帮助非洲的解放事业。
    声明在回顾非洲此起彼伏的民族独立运动的高潮时说，“这一连串的事件表明非洲的革命不可能是孤立的，全体非洲人的斗争完全是互相联系在一起的。尼亚萨兰、罗得西亚和中非的斗争最近普遍达到了高潮”。声明说，“毫无疑问，这些事件表明了非洲要求自由的真正愿望。帝国主义者的反应清楚地说明了他们真正害怕非洲将不再容忍他们的罪恶制度。”
    声明揭露：“我们看到英国提出一项把东非和中非的政治权力交给当地欧洲人的计划。在怯尼亚，英国殖民地部强使实行一项宪法：把全部权分交给六万名白种移民，并且帮助这一小部分人奴役八百万非洲人。”
    根据最近发现的文件，还暴露了一个新阴谋。受到英国政府帮助的移民企图用煽动暴力事件的办法来杀害一切非洲民族主义者。这个文件是东非和中非的殖民政府之间所缔结的可能用武力来阻止非洲民族主义的协定。
    声明接着说，目前对非洲民族主义者的大屠杀和大逮捕并不能停止非洲人争取他们天赋权力的斗争。声明说，非洲人决心争取自由，而不想对来这里居住的、非洲民族主义的敌人作丝毫让步。
    书记处认为，非洲人要求解放的普遍情绪“要求采取包括全世界一切爱好和平的人民的特别行动。书记处认为，应当立即采取某些具体措施”。
    声明要求联合国重新考虑它对待殖民地所采取的态度。声明说，“在人们要求自由的热望正在沸腾而人民还在帝国主义统治下受苦受难的世界上，殖民地问题已不再是殖民地人民和殖民者之间可以解决的内部事务。联合国应当设立一个特别委员会来调查各个殖民地的情况”。
    声明最后说，允许殖民地继续存在，“这确实是现代世界历史上的一个污点。帝国主义应当彻底消灭。”
