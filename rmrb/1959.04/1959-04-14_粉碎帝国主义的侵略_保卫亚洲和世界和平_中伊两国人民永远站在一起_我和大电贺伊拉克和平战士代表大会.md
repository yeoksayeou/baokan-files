Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: The Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace today sent a telegram to the first Iraqi Peace Warriors' Congress, to be held on the 14th, expressing warm congratulations on the convening of the congress and extending the most sublime brotherly respect to the Iraqi people who are engaged in heroic struggle.

The telegram from the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace stated: "The heroic Iraqi people have achieved brilliant victories in their struggle against imperialist aggression and in defense of national independence. Recently, they crushed the Shawwaf rebellion, which aimed to subvert the government of the Republic of Iraq, announced their withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact, and abolished Britain's privileged use of the Habbaniyah Air Force Base. These victories not only defended the fruits of the Iraqi people's national revolution, giving a severe blow to imperialism and domestic and foreign reactionary forces, but also served as a great encouragement to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle for national independence and as a major contribution to peace in the Middle East and the world.

"U.S. imperialism has been intensifying its plots to use armed threats and subversion against the Republic of Iraq, and it has been trying its best to create divisions and conflicts among Arab countries, and to sow discord between Arab countries and socialist countries, in order to achieve its goal of defeating them one by one. The aggressive bilateral military agreements recently signed by the United States with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan seriously threaten the security and peace of Arab countries, especially Iraq, and of Asia as a whole. Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Wellington meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council has planned new aggressive conspiracies and subversive activities in the Far East, creating new tensions. All this shows that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Arab people and the people of Asia and Africa in their struggle for independence and liberation, and the most ferocious enemy of peace in Asia and the world. The Arab people and the people of Asia and Africa must be vigilant, strengthen their unity, and wage a more resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism. In today's world, when the East wind prevails over the West wind, when the forces of peace are growing stronger, and when the people of Asia and Africa are increasingly united, all the despicable conspiracies of U.S. imperialism are bound to be completely shattered.

"The Chinese people have always cherished a deep brotherly friendship with the Iraqi people and resolutely support the Iraqi people's just struggle to safeguard national independence. We firmly believe that the united and heroic Iraqi people, under the leadership of Prime Minister Kassem, will overcome all difficulties and obstacles and achieve final victory. The 650 million Chinese people will forever stand with the Iraqi people and jointly struggle to completely crush the imperialist schemes of aggression, for the further victory of the anti-colonialist struggle of the Asian and African people, and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world."

　　粉碎帝国主义的侵略　保卫亚洲和世界和平
　　中伊两国人民永远站在一起
　　我和大电贺伊拉克和平战士代表大会
    新华社13日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会今天致电将在14日举行的伊拉克第一次和平战士代表大会，对大会的召开表示热烈的祝贺，并且向正在英勇斗争中的伊拉克人民表示最崇高的兄弟的敬意。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的贺电说：“英雄的伊拉克人民在反对帝国主义侵略、捍卫民族独立的斗争中连续取得了辉煌的胜利，最近又扑灭了旨在颠覆伊拉克共和国政府的沙瓦夫叛乱，宣布退出巴格达条约，废除了英国利用哈巴尼雅基空军基地的特权。这些胜利不但保卫了伊拉克人民民族革命的果实，给予帝国主义及国内外反动势力以严重的打击，并且是对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民争取和维护民族独立斗争的巨大鼓舞和对中东及全世界和平的重大贡献。
    “美帝国主义一直在加紧策划武装威胁和颠覆伊拉克共和国的阴谋活动，并竭力在阿拉伯国家之间制造分裂与冲突，挑拨阿拉伯国家与社会主义国家之间的关系，以便达到它各个击破的目的。最近美国和伊朗、土耳其及巴基斯坦签订的侵略性双边军事协定，严重地威胁着阿拉伯国家尤其是伊拉克和整个亚洲的安全与和平。在美帝国主义纠集之下，东南亚条约组织理事会惠灵顿会议，更在远东策划了新的侵略阴谋和颠覆活动，制造新的紧张局势。这一切都说明美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民和亚非人民独立解放的最凶恶的敌人，是亚洲与世界和平最凶恶的敌人。阿拉伯人民和亚非人民必须提高警惕，加强团结，与美帝国主义进行更加坚决的斗争。在东风压倒西风、和平力量日益强大、亚非人民日益团结的今天，美帝国主义的这一切卑鄙阴谋必然要被彻底粉碎。
    “中国人民对伊拉克人民一向怀着深厚的兄弟友谊，并坚决支持伊拉克人民维护民族独立的正义斗争。我们深信，团结一致、英勇斗争的伊拉克人民，在卡塞姆总理的领导下，必将克服一切困难和障碍，取得最后的胜利。六亿五千万中国人民将永远和伊拉克人民一道，为彻底粉碎帝国主义的侵略阴谋、为亚洲和非洲人民反殖民主义斗争的进一步胜利、为保卫亚洲及世界和平而共同奋斗。”
