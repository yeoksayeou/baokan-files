　　Execution Poem by Xia Minghan
　　It doesn't matter to lose my head, as long as the doctrine is true.
　　Even if you kill Xia Minghan, there will be successors.
    Two Poems by He Jinzhai
　　Clouds and mist obscure the long road, it is hard to say goodbye to my family.
　　I will give my body to my Party, unlikely to be able to serve you with coarse food again.
　　Loyalty and filial piety are two different paths, I hope my brother will shoulder the responsibility of filial piety.
　　The enemy before us is extremely ferocious, I vow to eliminate tigers and wolves for the people.
    What I Saw in Nanjing Prison by Li Shaoshi
　　Mother's heart has shattered with the rivers and mountains, justice will always contend for the light of the sun and moon.
　　I will not die an ordinary death on my bed, a hero goes to the execution ground with a smile.
    To My Mother by Li Shaoshi
　　How can I both fulfill my duty and support you? In these times of crisis, it's hard to do both.
　　I hope you will save today's tears for your son, to weep for the people without a country in the future.

　　革命烈士诗钞?
　　就义诗　夏明翰
　　砍头不要紧，只要主义真。
　　杀了夏明翰，还有后来人。
    诗二首　贺锦斋
　　云遮雾绕路漫漫，一别庭帏欲见难。
　　吾将吾身交吾党，难能菽水再承欢。
　　忠孝本来事两行，孝亲事望弟承担。
　　眼前大敌狰狞甚，誓为人民灭虎狼。
    南京书所见　李少石
　　母心已共河山碎，大义长争日月光。
　　不作寻常床箦死，英雄含笑上刑场。
    寄母　李少石
　　赴义争能计养亲？时危难作两全身。
　　望将今日思儿泪，留哭明朝无国人。
