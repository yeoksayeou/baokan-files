　　Mountainous Area Gets Highway
　　Wen County is a mountainous area on the border of Gansu and Sichuan, with an area of over 6,000 square kilometers and a population of 130,000. The climate here is mild, and the scenery is beautiful. Rice paddies are arranged in the valleys, and dense forests grow on the hillsides. The local specialties are very rich, with more than 200 kinds of medicinal materials and various wild plants. There are also world-rare treasures – golden monkeys. However, due to the overlapping mountains, transportation is very difficult. The historically famous Yinping Road is located here.
　　Before liberation, there were only three pack animal routes leading to other places. Accidents involving people and animals falling off cliffs and dying occurred frequently on the cliffside plank roads. The masses spread the ballad, "Going up the mountain is like ascending to the sky, the river is like the palace of the King of Hell, carrying things to go out, not knowing whether one will return." During the Kuomintang rule, in order to plunder mountain resources, they spent ten years, surveying and repairing a section of the Gansu-Sichuan highway passing through the county three times, consuming countless labor and sacrificing many lives, but only dug a few sections of earthwork. After the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in 1956, the local party and government leaders and the masses decided to build mountain highways. At that time, technical strength was very lacking, so they held training courses to train migrant workers by finding demobilized soldiers and craftsmen in the countryside who had built roads in the past. In that year, they opened up the Caopingliang Mountain, which rises 2,000 meters above sea level, blasted open the cliffs on the Bailong River, and built a highway connecting Wen County to Wudu.
　　Last year, they spent only seven months and built a trunk highway more than 100 kilometers long from Wen County to Yaojiadu, which is even more arduous and connects to Sichuan. In addition, they also built 170 kilometers of highways leading to mining areas and 30 kilometers of highways connecting districts and townships, the workload is equivalent to three times that of 1956. Taking the section of the highway from Wen County to Yaojiadu as an example, there are 520,000 cubic meters of stone alone.
　　The people of Wen County regard the construction of these mountain highways as their own happy event. When the highways were opened to traffic, farmers from far and near came to see the cars, supporting the old and carrying the young. Everyone watched and discussed excitedly: In 1954, Wen County supported Wudu County with 150,000 catties of grain. Because there was no road and no cars could be used, people had to carry it on their backs. At that time, the main labor force of three of the five districts in Wen County was mobilized. In 1957, the grain transported to Wudu increased to 2.5 million catties, which was completely transported by car. Everyone calculated that if people were to carry it, each person would need ten days to carry 100 catties back and forth, and 2.5 million catties of grain would require 250,000 workdays, which is equivalent to about 80% of the total labor force used by Wen County to build the Wenwu Highway. In other words, the labor saved by the single item of grain transportation in 1957 can offset most of the labor spent on road construction. The people of Wen County deeply realized the benefits brought to them by mountain highways. When they accepted the road construction task, they always tried their best to complete it quickly, in large quantities, and well.

### 山区有了公路

　　山区有了公路
    文县是甘肃、四川边境的一个山区，面积有六千多平方公里，人口有十三万。这里气候温和，风景秀丽，河谷里排列着块块的稻田，山坡上长的是茂密的森林，土特产非常丰富，药材就有二百多种，各种野生植物也多，还有世界稀有珍品——金丝猴。但是由于山峦重叠，交通非常险阻。历史上著名的阴平道就在这里。
    解放前，这里只有三条驮运道通向外地，悬崖栈道，人畜掉崖伤亡事故经常发生，群众中流传着“上山好比上青天，江水好比阎王殿，背上东西出门去，不知回还不回还”的歌谣。国民党统治时代，为了劫取山区资源，曾以十年时间，三测三修穿过县境的一段甘川公路，耗费了无数劳动力，牺牲了不少生命，结果只挖了几段土方。1956年农业合作化高潮以后，当地党政领导和群众决心大修山区公路。当时，技术力量非常缺乏，他们就举办训练班，把农村中过去曾经修过公路的复员军人和工匠找了来培训民工。当年，他们就打通了拔海二千公尺的草坪梁山，炸开了白龙江上悬崖削壁，修通了文县通武都的公路。
    去年，他们仅仅用了七个月的时间，又修通了一条长达一百多公里、工程更艰巨的文县至姚家渡、并通往四川的干线公路，另外还修建了通往矿区的公路一百七十公里及联接区乡的公路三十公里，工作量相当于1956年的三倍。以文县至姚家渡一段公路来说，仅石方就有五十二万方。
    文县人民把修通这些山区公路当作自己的喜事，公路通车时，远近农民都扶老携幼赶来看汽车，大家边看边兴奋地议论着：那是1954年的时候，文县支援武都县十五万斤粮食，因为没有路，不能用车子，只得人来背，当时在文县五个区中就动员了三个区的主要劳动力。而1957年调运武都的粮食增至二百五十万斤，就完全是由汽车运输的。大家算了一笔账，如用人背，每人背一百斤往返需要十天，二百五十万斤粮，就要用二十五万个工日，就等于修文武公路文县所用全部劳动力的80％左右。也就是说，单单1957年运粮一项所节省的劳动力，就可低偿筑路时花费的劳动力的大部分。文县人民深切地体会到山区公路给他们带来的好处。他们接受筑路任务时，总是想尽办法完成得又快又多又好。
