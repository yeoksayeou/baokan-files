Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 2nd. How to enable steelmaking converters across the country to rapidly increase output and quality, and continuously reduce production costs, is of great importance to fulfilling this year's target of 18 million tons of steel. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry convened a national converter steelmaking conference in Shanghai from March 20th to 29th to focus on this issue.

The conference pointed out that the development policy for converter steelmaking this year is: to consolidate and improve on the basis of last year's great development, and to fully utilize existing production capacity. For equipment already put into production, rapidly increase output and quality; for equipment that has not yet been put into production but can be quickly put into production with proper matching, immediately seize the opportunity to complete the matching. According to this policy, the conference put forward specific goals for converter workers across the country: on the premise of ensuring quality, the average utilization coefficient of newly built converters should rapidly catch up with the current level of old factories, and the utilization coefficient of old factories should be further improved; resolutely eliminate high-sulfur steel and strive to improve the quality of converter steel; strive to save raw materials such as pig iron, ferroalloys, and refractory materials.

The conference decided to take measures in six aspects to ensure a greater leap forward in converter steel this year. First, all regions should quickly formulate operating regulations in accordance with the operating points formulated by the conference and in light of local conditions, vigorously promote the operating method of "frequent rocking, less movement, and mainly top blowing," and do everything possible to improve furnace life; at the same time, promote advanced experiences such as hot blast alkaline iron furnaces as soon as possible to increase steel output and quality. Second, establish a management system for raw materials such as pig iron and coke, and implement a graded and stacked management method to ensure the stability of the charge for iron-smelting furnaces and converters. Third, for factory buildings and equipment that have not yet been put into production, seize the time to complete the matching to put them into production as soon as possible. Fourth, quickly improve the organizational structure of converter steel plants (workshops), strengthen the allocation of cadres, open foreman training classes, and vigorously train technical forces. Fifth, further strengthen production organization and management, establish and improve systems such as plan management, technical inspection, operation planning, and equipment inspection and repair to ensure the completion of plans on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. Sixth, comprehensively launch a mass movement centered on technological revolution.

At the conference, twenty representatives introduced many advanced experiences in various aspects of converter steelmaking. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant built seven new three-ton converters in September last year. At the beginning, they only blew a few furnaces before they broke. Later, the factory leaders handed over the problem of short furnace life caused by the furnace lining to the masses for discussion, and the workers immediately came up with many good ways to improve the quality of the furnace lining. They selected and fired the dolomite used for making furnace linings, and assigned special personnel to be responsible for transportation. By December last year, the average furnace life had increased to more than 60 furnaces, with some reaching 80 furnaces. The Gu Xian Iron and Steel Plant, which did not have equipment such as brick presses and new-style kilns, adopted the "thin-layer heavy-hitting" bricklaying method. Before laying bricks, they heated the brick mold and covered the hot brick sand with cotton quilts to prevent heat from escaping. The highest furnace life also reached more than 90 furnaces. Representatives of old converter steel plants in Shanghai, Tangshan, and other places emphasized the importance of strengthening management systems in their introductions of experiences. After the Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant established a complete and effective management system in terms of raw material management, operating procedures, equipment maintenance, and product inspection, iron loss was greatly reduced, and the qualified rate of steel reached more than 98%.

The conference widely exchanged technical experiences in various aspects of converter steelmaking, formulated a set of operating points for converter steelmaking, and passed a proposal for converter workers across the country to carry out a socialist emulation drive for high output and high quality, calling on employees of converter steel plants across the country to take immediate action and launch a red flag competition for high output and high quality.

More than 500 people attended the conference, including directors of metallurgical industry bureaus (departments) from 27 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, directors of converter steel plants, and directors of converter workshops.

In order to help those regions with insufficient technical strength to rapidly increase converter steel production, the conference decided to start holding foreman training classes in early April, and designated technical research departments, design departments, and old converter steel plants in Beijing, Tangshan, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places to organize more than a dozen technical groups to go to various places to help solve technical problems.

    充分发挥转炉炼钢能力 
    冶金部大力推广先进操作经验
    从六个方面着手保证转炉生产更大跃进
    据新华社上海2日电　如何使全国各地的炼钢转炉迅速提高产量质量，不断降低生产成本，这对完成今年一千八百万吨钢有着重大的关系。冶金工业部3月20日到29日在上海召开全国转炉炼钢会议，集中研究了这个问题。
    会议指出，今年转炉炼钢的发展方针是：在去年大发展的基础上加以整顿、巩固和提高，充分利用已有生产能力。已经投入生产的设备，迅速提高产量质量；目前没有投入生产而只要配好套就能迅速投入生产的，要立即抓紧配套。根据这一方针，会议向全国转炉工作者提出了具体的奋斗目标：在保证质量的前提下，要求新建转炉的平均利用系数迅速赶上目前老厂的水平，老厂的利用系数也要再进一步提高；坚决消灭高硫钢，努力提高转炉钢的质量；努力节约生铁、铁合金、耐火材料等原材料。
    会议决定从六个方面采取措施，来保证实现今年转炉钢更大的跃进。一、各地迅速按照会议制定的操作要点，因地制宜地制定操作规程，大力推广“勤摇少动、面吹为主”的操作方法，千方百计地提高炉龄；同时尽快地推广热风碱性化铁炉等先进经验，提高钢的产量和质量。二、建立生铁和焦炭等原材料的管理制度，实行分级分堆的管理方法，保证化铁炉和转炉配料的稳定性。三、还未投入生产的厂房设备，要抓紧时间进行配套，使之尽速投入生产。四、迅速健全转炉钢厂（车间）的组织机构，加强干部配备，开办工长训练班，大力培训技术力量。五、进一步加强生产组织管理工作，建立和健全计划管理、技术检验、作业计划、设备验修等制度，保证按日按旬按月完成计划。六、全面开展以技术革命为中心的群众运动。
    这次会议上有二十位代表介绍了转炉炼钢各方面的许多先进经验。石景山钢铁厂去年9月份新建了七个三吨转炉，开始时只吹了几炉子就坏了，后来工厂领导上把造成炉龄短的炉衬问题交给群众讨论，工人们马上想出了许多提高炉衬质量的好办法。他们把做炉衬用的白云石选好、烧好，并且派专人负责运输，到去年12月份炉龄就平均提高到六十炉以上，高的达到八十炉。没有压砖机、新式窑等设备条件的故县钢铁厂采取了“薄层重打”的打砖方法，打砖以前先把砖模烘热，砖砂热了以后用棉被盖起来，不让热量跑掉，炉龄最高的也达到九十炉以上。上海、唐山等地老转炉钢厂的代表，在介绍的经验中特别强调加强管理制度的重要性。上钢六厂在原料管理、操作规程、设备检修、产品检验等方面，建立了一套完整有效的管理制度以后，铁损大大降低，钢的合格率达到98％以上。
    会议广泛交流了转炉炼钢各方面的技术经验，制订了一套转炉炼钢的操作要点，并且通过了全国转炉工作者开展高产优质社会主义竞赛的倡议，号召全国转炉钢厂职工立即行动起来，开展高产优质的红旗竞赛。
    参加会议的有二十七个省、市、自治区的冶金工业厅（局）长，转炉钢厂厂长，以及转炉车间主任等五百多人。
    为了帮助那些技术力量不足的地区迅速提高转炉钢产量，会议决定在4月初就着手举办工长训练班，并且指定北京、唐山、天津、上海、重庆等地的技术研究部门，设计部门和老转炉钢厂，组织十多个技术小组，分赴各地去协助解决技术问题。（附图片）
