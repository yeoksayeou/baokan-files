Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, April 4th: Reporter Shi Yue'e reports: The Fushun West Open-Pit Coal Mine has focused on the issue of the utilization rate of mechanical equipment, mobilizing the masses of workers to diligently inspect and repair mechanical equipment, making machinery long-lasting and high-speed, which has greatly increased coal production.

The West Open-Pit Coal Mine is a highly mechanized open-pit coal mine. Last year, through the efforts of all mine workers, coal production jumped to more than 5.86 million tons, exceeding the design level ahead of schedule. However, due to insufficient attention to equipment maintenance, mechanical failures have occurred frequently this year, seriously affecting coal mining operations. In this situation, some people pinned their hopes for increased production on adding equipment, without actively organizing repairs, so the production in January and February could not meet the planned requirements.

In early March, Shen Yue, the First Secretary of the Fushun Municipal Party Committee, arrived at the West Open-Pit Mine. He personally went deep into the work teams, working, investigating the situation, and solving problems, organizing workers to carry out red banner competitions in the same trades and cooperative areas, and found the crux of the equipment problems. At the same time, a working group sent by the Municipal Party Committee tracked and measured the utilization rate of equipment in various trades at the West Open-Pit Mine. According to the working group's investigation, at that time, 300 of the mine's 800 coal transport vehicles were damaged and unusable for various reasons, resulting in poor vehicle turnover. Electric picks on the front line of coal mining also had low operating rates due to improper maintenance and insufficient parts. They also found that the No. 5 electric pick and the No. 11 locomotive had never experienced mechanical failures and had high operating rates because workers actively carried out maintenance. They used these very persuasive examples to educate the masses of workers, making it clear that as long as equipment maintenance and management are strengthened, and the utilization rate of existing equipment is fully utilized, production can be greatly increased without adding equipment.

The West Open-Pit Mining Area Party Committee, under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, acted quickly. They mobilized workers to attack the mechanical failure barrier. The workers put forward the slogan "Operating workers become fitters, self-inspect and self-repair to ensure self-use," and a large number of technical innovation achievements in more loading, fast pulling, and fast tipping emerged. Mechanical equipment accidents were greatly reduced, and damaged equipment was also quickly put into production through the full support and crash repairs of workers from various machinery factories. As a result, in just ten days, the utilization rate of mechanical equipment has been significantly improved. The average loading operation rate of the entire mine has been shortened from eighteen minutes to fourteen minutes, and the locomotive transport cycle has been shortened from fifty-one minutes to forty-five minutes. In this way, the coal production of the entire mine has risen sharply, with an average daily output increase of 49.3% compared to February.

In this mass movement to focus on mechanical equipment maintenance, operating workers and maintenance workers greatly promoted the spirit of active cooperation. Many electric pick operators and locomotive drivers, under the call of "Operating workers become fitters," brought their own tools and seized production gaps to inspect mechanical equipment anytime and anywhere to prevent failures. Liu Derun, the driver of the No. 11 locomotive, has become one of the mine's red banners for safe production. He seizes every minute of break time during operation to carry out maintenance. Sometimes, if he finds a screw is loose, he tightens it. If he sees that the contact paper is damaged, he immediately replaces it. He always adheres to the principle of being both stable and fast when operating. The first train he drives every day is slower, with the purpose of first checking the condition of the line and mechanical equipment, and then gradually increasing the speed. Because Liu Derun correctly implemented the principle of self-inspection and self-repair, he has avoided many failures, and he has not had a single accident since the beginning of this year. In the past, locomotive drivers and road repair workers rarely cooperated and could not promptly repair critical lines. Now, the "throw white bag" system has been implemented. When a locomotive is running and finds that the line is uneven, it scatters a handful of white powder as a sign to allow road repair workers to discover and repair it in time, in order to reduce and avoid derailment accidents. Now, the habit of caring for and maintaining mechanical equipment has become a trend among workers.

While vigorously strengthening the maintenance of mechanical equipment, the mine workers launched a struggle for high efficiency and high speed to fully exploit the potential of the equipment and increase coal production. Coal mining electric picks have always used 1.53 cubic meter buckets, which require three buckets to fill a car of coal, resulting in low efficiency. Luo Dezhi, the driver of the No. 6 electric pick, suggested increasing the bucket to 1.8 cubic meters, which can shovel one more ton of coal, and two scoops can fill a car. In the past, some people were worried that the electric pick would be overloaded and did not dare to adopt this suggestion; now, because the electric pick workers have strengthened maintenance work, they have created conditions for increasing the bucket size. The No. 6 electric pick adjusted the two motors on the pick, and it runs normally after the bucket was enlarged. In the past, it took more than 15 minutes to load 14 cars with a small bucket. With the large bucket, it only takes 13 minutes, and it also created the highest record of loading 16 cars in 7 minutes and 50 seconds. At present, six electric picks in the mine have been equipped with larger buckets. Ma Baolin, the driver of the No. 4 electric pick, also used the power of the electric pick to create an automatic car puller to implement self-pulling and self-loading, which can save a locomotive.

The Fushun Municipal Party Committee also mobilized Fushun's various machinery factories to cooperate and support the West Open-Pit Mine in repairing mechanical equipment. Some equipment that had not been running for several years is now running again. The Mine South Electrical and Mechanical Plant single-handedly undertook the task of repairing nearly 300 coal cars and more than 20 kinds of parts. Everyone in the plant, from top to bottom, launched a crash repair effort. The Party Secretary and the Factory Director personally went to the workshop to help the workers swing sledgehammers. The workers put forward many rationalization proposals, and the production efficiency of eleven kinds of parts has been improved by several times on average compared with the past. Therefore, nearly 300 coal cars, which could not be repaired in a year in the past, were all repaired in less than four days and sent to the West Open-Pit Mine with gongs and drums. With the strong support of various machinery factories, all the axle tile coal cars in the West Open-Pit Mine have been converted to ball bearings in a few days, and the supply of parts is sufficient, providing very favorable conditions for continuous increase in coal production.

    维护机械长寿　保证产量大增
    抚顺西露天煤矿开展群众运动取得巨大成就
    新华社抚顺4日电　记者史越峨报道：抚顺西露天煤矿紧紧抓住机械设备利用率的问题，发动职工群众勤检勤修机械设备，使机械长寿高速，大大提高了煤的产量。
    西露天煤矿是一个高度机械化采煤的露天矿。去年经过全矿职工的努力，煤产量猛跳到五百八十六万多吨，提前超过了设计水平。但是由于设备维护保养工作注意不够，今年以来机械常出故障，严重地影响到采煤作业。在这种情况下，有人把增产寄托在添置设备上，没有积极组织检修，因此1、2月份的生产不能达到计划要求。
    3月初，中共抚顺市委第一书记沈越到了西露天矿。他亲自深入到班组，边劳动，边摸情况，边排问题，组织工人开展同工种和协作区的红旗竞赛，找到了设备问题的症结。同时，市委派出的一个工作组，在西露天矿跟班测定了各工种设备的利用率，根据工作组的调查，当时全矿八百辆运煤车因各种原因损坏不用的就有三百辆，以致车辆周转不灵。采煤第一线的电镐也因维修不当，零件不足，作业率不高。他们也发现了五号电镐和十一号机车因工人主动进行维修保养，今年从未发生机械故障，作业率很高。他们用这些十分有说服力的事例教育职工群众，使大家明确了只要加强设备的维修管理，充分发挥现有设备的利用率，不添置设备就可以大大增产。
    西露天矿区党委在市委的直接领导下，迅速行动起来了。他们发动工人猛攻机械故障关，工人们提出了“操作工人钳工化，自检自修保自用”的行动口号，涌现出大量多装、快拉、快翻的技术革新成就，机械设备事故大大减少，损坏了的设备也经各机械厂工人全力支援，突击抢修，迅速投入了生产。因而在短短十天内，机械设备利用率有显著提高，全矿装车作业率平均从十八分钟缩短到十四分钟，机车运输周期从五十一分钟缩短到四十五分钟。这样，全矿煤产量就直线上升，平均日产量比2月份增长49.3％。
    在这次大抓机械设备维修的群众运动中，操作工人、检修工人大大发扬了主动协作精神。许多电镐手，机车司机，都在“操作工人钳工化”的号召下，纷纷自带工具，抓住生产空隙，随时随地检查机械设备，防止故障。十一号机车司机刘德润更成为全矿安全生产的红旗之一，他在运行过程中，抓住每一分钟空隙进行检修，有时发现螺丝松了，就扭扭紧，看到接触纸坏了，马上换一张。他在操作时始终掌握既稳又快的原则，每天上班第一列车开得较慢，目的是先摸摸线路和机械设备的情况，然后逐渐加快速度。由于刘德润正确地贯彻了自检自修的原则，避免了多次故障，他今年以来就没有发生过一次事故。过去，机车司机和修路工人很少配合，不能及时抢修要害线路，现在推行了“扔白袋”制度，机车开到那里发现线路不平稳，就撒下一把白粉作标志，使修路工人及时发现进行修理，以减少和避免脱轨事故。现在，爱护保养机械设备已在工人中形成风气。
    在大力加强机械设备维修保养的同时，全矿工人展开了高工效，高速度的斗争，以充分发挥设备潜力，增产煤炭。采煤电镐一向使用一点五三立方公尺的勺斗，要三勺斗才能装满一车煤，效率较低。六号电镐司机罗德志建议把勺斗增大到一点八立方公尺，可以多铲一吨煤，两勺就能装满一车。这个建议过去有人担心电镐负荷过重，不敢采纳；现在因为电镐工人加强了维修保养工作，为加大勺斗创造了条件。六号电镐调整了镐上两个马达，加大勺斗之后运行正常，过去用小勺斗，装十四辆车一般都要十五分钟以上，改用大勺斗就只要十三分钟，而且还创造了七分五十秒装十六辆车的最高纪录。目前，全矿已有六台电镐加大了勺斗。四号电镐司机马宝林还利用电镐的动力，创造了自动拉车器，实行自拉自装，可以节省一辆机车。
    中共抚顺市委还发动抚顺各机械工厂协作，支援西露天矿抢修机械设备，一些几年未转动的设备，现在也转动起来了。矿南机电厂一手承担了近三百台煤车和二十多种配件的抢修任务，全厂从上到下人人突击，党委书记和厂长都亲自下车间帮工人抡大锤。工人们提出了许多合理化建议，十一种配件的生产效率平均比过去提高好几倍，因此过去一年也修理不完的近三百辆煤车，不到四天就全部抢修好，敲锣打鼓地送到西露天矿。在各机械工厂的大力支援下，西露天矿的轴瓦煤车在几天内全部实现了滚珠轴承化，零件供应充足，为不断增产煤炭提供了十分有利的条件。
