(Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report from Dortmund) On the afternoon of the 5th, Chinese young table tennis player Rong Guotuan defeated Hungarian player Sidó 3-1 in the men's singles final of the 25th World Table Tennis Championships, winning the world championship title. This is the first time China has won a world championship title since the World Table Tennis Championships began in 1927, and it is also the first world championship won by a Chinese athlete in a world sports competition.

      Rising Star, Capable of Both Offense and Defense
    Rong Guotuan is 21 years old and from Guangdong. He developed a love for table tennis at school when he was twelve years old and has been diligently practicing, improving his skills rapidly. In 1958, he won the national men's singles championship in the National Table Tennis Championships, making him a rising star among Chinese table tennis players.
    Rong Guotuan is known for his fast attacks and fierce strokes. His greatest characteristic is his comprehensive technique; he is capable of both offense and defense. He can use pulling, chopping, pushing, blocking, left and right smashes, and short drops with ease. Moreover, he remains calm during matches and can change his tactics according to different opponents. Last year, when he played against the visiting Hungarian table tennis team in Beijing for the first time, he lost to European champion Berczik. However, soon after, when they played a second match in Guangzhou, he changed his style based on Berczik's characteristics and won. Similarly, when playing against another Hungarian player, Foldi, he lost the first time but won the second time. Therefore, people call him a table tennis "all-rounder."

      A Good Match, Talented Opponents Meet
    The Hungarian player Sidó, who competed with Rong Guotuan for the world championship, is an internationally known veteran of the table tennis court. He is 36 years old and has won nine world championships. Before this championship, Sidó and Rong Guotuan had faced off twice. Once in Hungary, Rong Guotuan won 3-0; once in the group stage of this World Championship, Sidó won 3-0.
    Sidó is experienced, having fought hundreds of battles. He showed excellent performance in this World Championship. In the men's singles, he successively defeated the Yugoslavian opponent Harangozo, who had defeated him many times before, and the Japanese player Murakami, who remained undefeated in this men's team competition. He also defeated the second seed, the famous Japanese player Ogimura, who had held the world championship for two consecutive terms, 3-2 in the quarter-finals. Rong Guotuan told Xinhua reporters after the final with Sidó: "Sidó has been in very good competitive condition in recent matches, and I was a little worried before the match." This shows that the veteran was indeed a strong opponent in the fight for the world championship.
  Bravely Passing Seven Hurdles, Winning Six Generals in a Row
    Before the final with Sidó, Rong Guotuan had undergone arduous battles to obtain the right to compete in the final.
    This World Men's Singles Championship brought together more than 240 outstanding players from 38 countries and regions. Before obtaining the right to the final, Rong Guotuan had passed seven hurdles, winning six generals in a row, including a European champion, two national champions, and one national runner-up, fighting a total of twenty-two rounds.
    Rong Guotuan had a bye in the first round of the singles competition.
    Second round: Won against West German player Langer, 3-1 (21-12, 21-15, 20-22, 21-13).
    Third round: Won against Yugoslavian 1959 national champion Vo. Markovic, 3-0 (21-9, 21-16, 21-7).
    Fourth round: Won against Sweden's Erikson, 3-0 (21-13, 21-7, 21-17).
    Fifth round: Won against Japanese runner-up Hoshino, 3-1 (21-18, 17-21, 21-16, 21-14).
    Sixth round: Semi-final won against the famous Hungarian player and European champion, Berczik, 3-2 (17-21, 21-15, 21-19, 18-21, 21-5).
    Seventh round: Quarter-final won against multiple American champion Myles, 3-2 (22-20, 23-25, 12-21, 21-18, 21-8).

      Four Fierce Games, Winning the Championship
    The final between Rong Guotuan and Sidó was a fierce match. This match became the most attractive match of the World Table Tennis Championships in Dortmund in recent days.
    When the final time arrived, Sidó and Rong Guotuan entered the court. The two famous players met, and each displayed their skills to strive for victory.
    At the beginning of the first game, Rong Guotuan launched a fierce offensive, using the tactics of pulling left and attacking right, and serving and attacking, leading 7-3. Sidó then strengthened his counterattack, catching up to 8-8. From then on, the two attacked each other, each gaining and losing points, and the score difference remained within two points, from 9-9, 12-12, 16-16 to 17-17. At this time, Sidó scored with a counterattack, and Rong Guotuan made a mistake in attacking, losing the first game 19-21.
    In the second game, Rong Guotuan summed up the reasons for the failure of the previous game, strengthened the power of his pulls, and paid attention to Sidó's counterattack. After 4-4, Rong Guotuan's kills became more and more accurate, and he also suppressed Sidó's counterattack, putting the opponent in a passive position. At 6-4, Rong Guotuan attacked the opponent's right corner fiercely, and then scored another point with a fake action that looked like a short drop but was actually a smash. This ball was played very beautifully and won warm applause from the audience. Rong Guotuan was in the lead in this game, using both long and short shots, and getting what he wanted. Sidó tried his best to save the situation, but still lost 12-21, and Rong Guotuan tied the score to 1-1.
    In the third game, Sidó desperately added spin and forced the corners, seizing opportunities to counterattack, leading 7-4. But Rong Guotuan maintained a very clear mind, calmly responded, and did not panic at all, serving and attacking, immediately catching up. Rong Guotuan's serve was varied and scored repeatedly. At the same time, his topspin pull made it difficult for Sidó to counterattack. At 13-8 (Rong Guotuan leading), Sidó found an opportunity to attack four times in a row, but they were all pushed back by Rong Guotuan's left push and right attack, and continuous chopping and hitting. Therefore, Rong Guotuan won another game 21-15. At this time, Rong Guotuan had already won two games out of three, putting him in an advantageous position.
    In the fourth game, Rong Guotuan had even stronger confidence, and Sidó's best corner-forcing counterattack could not be used under Rong Guotuan's control. At this time, Sidó was mainly retreating outside the table, and although there were occasional raids, they were mostly inaccurate. And Rong Guotuan's tactics at this time were very flexible, pulling, smashing, chopping, and dropping, handling them with ease, hitting both steadily and accurately, and finally winning the final victory 21-14. After the match, Rong Guotuan and Sidó shook hands tightly, showing each other's feelings of friendly affection.
    Rong Guotuan then walked to the award platform to receive the World Men's Singles Championship trophy - the St. Bride Vase. Accompanying him to the award platform were Sidó, who won the runner-up, and Ogimura of Japan and Myles of the United States, who tied for third place.
    In this final, Rong Guotuan had a strong fighting will and confidence, thus fully playing his technical ability. Moreover, he learned from the experience and lessons of his past duels with Sidó, flexibly using a variety of tactics, so this young player finally won high honor for the motherland.

      Humbly Learning, Continuing to Train
    After the final, Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed Rong Guotuan. He told reporters: "The fundamental reason why I was able to achieve victory in this competition is the party's cultivation and education of me, and the encouragement of the great leap forward in the motherland's socialist construction." Then, he talked about how he was a little worried before the match because Sidó's competitive state was very good. He said: "However, when I thought that I was fighting for honor for the motherland, I finally mustered up the courage, strengthened my confidence, calmly responded, and normally played my technique. In the game, except for some nervousness in the first game, the whole thing was relatively calm. In terms of tactical application, thanks to the help of our team's collective strength, and I also learned from the experience and lessons of past matches with Sidó, so I was able to use it more freely on the spot."
    Rong Guotuan finally said: "Although I have won the glorious title of world champion, I am still very young, and I still need to continuously improve in politics and technology. In the future, I must prevent pride and complacency, continue to work hard to exercise, humbly learn, and work with comrades to win more honors for the motherland."
    Rong Guotuan's victory powerfully shows the vigorous development and leap-forward progress of China's sports.
    China's men's and women's table tennis teams only began to participate in the World Table Tennis Championships in March 1953. At that time, China's men's team was rated as the tenth in the world's first level, and the women's team was rated as the third in the second level. However, after only six short years, China's men's and women's table tennis teams have both been rated as the third in the first level in this World Championship. Rong Guotuan won the world championship in the singles competition. The Chinese athletes who participated in various competitions in this World Championship, such as Zhuang Jiafu, Yang Ruihua, Wang Chuanyao, Xu Yinsheng, Qiu Zhonghui, and Sun Meiying, also defeated many world-renowned players with their tenacious will. This is a brilliant achievement in the history of Chinese sports. It shines as brightly as the world records created by China's weightlifting, track and field, swimming, and parachute athletes.

    容国团争夺世界冠军决战记详
    本报综合报道　据新华社多特蒙德消息：我国青年乒乓球选手容国团于5日下午，在第二十五届世界乒乓球锦标赛男子单打决赛中，以三比一战胜匈牙利选手西多，而荣获世界冠军称号。这是世界乒乓球锦标赛从1927年举行以来，中国第一次赢得世界冠军的称号，也是中国运动员在体育比赛的世界锦标赛中获得的第一个世界冠军。
      后起之秀　能攻能守
    容国团今年二十一岁，广东人。他十二岁时就在学校里养成了对乒乓球运动的爱好，一直勤学苦练，技术提高很快。1958年在全国乒乓球锦标赛中，获得了全国男子单打冠军的称号，是我国乒乓球选手中的后起之秀。
    容国团以快攻著称，板法凌厉。他最大的特点，是技术比较全面，能攻也能守，拉、搓、推、挡、左右抽击和放短球都能运用自如，而且临场比赛，头脑冷静，能根据不同的对手，改变自己的战术。去年，他和来我国访问的匈牙利乒乓球队在北京进行第一次比赛时，败于欧洲冠军别尔切克。但是，不久，他俩在广州作第二次比赛时，他根据别尔切克的特点，改变了打法，取得了胜利。同样，在和匈牙利另一位选手福尔迪进行比赛时，也是第一次输，第二次就赢了回来。因此，人们把他称做乒乓球的“多面手”。
      球逢对手　将遇良才
    同容国团争夺世界冠军的匈牙利选手西多，是国际知名的乒乓球场的老将。他今年三十六岁，曾荣获九次世界冠军。在这次冠军赛之前，西多同容国团曾有过两次交锋。一次是在匈牙利，容国团以三比○获胜；一次是在这次世界锦标团体赛的复赛中，西多以三比○获胜。
    西多身经百战，经验丰富。在这一届世界锦标赛中，有极为出色的表现。在男子单打赛中他接连击败了曾经多次战胜过他的南斯拉夫对手哈兰戈索和在这次男子团体比赛中保持不败的日本选手村上，又在复赛中以三比二击败了保持两届世界冠军的第二号种子日本名手荻村。容国团在与西多决战后曾向新华社记者说：“西多在最近几场比赛中，竞技状态很好，我在比赛前有些担心。”可见，这位老将的确是争夺世界冠军的一个强劲的对手。
  勇闯七关　连胜六将
    容国团在同西多决战前，为取得决赛权，曾经历了艰苦的战斗。
    这次世界男子单打锦标赛，集中了三十八个国家和地区的二百四十多个优秀选手。容国团在取得决赛权之前，曾闯过七关，连胜六将，其中包括一个欧洲冠军、两个国家冠军、一个国家亚军，先后撕杀了二十二个回合。
    容国团在单打赛的第一轮中轮空。
    第二轮胜西德名将朗格，三比一（二十一比十二，二十一比十五，二十比二十二，二十一比十三）。
    第三轮胜南斯拉夫1959年的全国冠军沃·马科维奇，三比○（二十一比九，二十一比十六，二十一比七）。
    第四轮胜瑞典的埃里克森，三比○（二十一比十三，二十一比七，二十一比十七）。
    第五轮胜日本亚军星野，三比一（二十一比十八，十七比二十一，二十一比十六，二十一比十四）。
    第六轮半复赛胜著名的匈牙利选手欧洲冠军——别尔切克，三比二（十七比二十一，二十一比十五，二十一比十九，十八比二十一，二十一比五）。
    第七轮复赛胜多次美国冠军迈耳斯，三比二（二十二比二十，二十三比二十五，十二比二十一，二十一比十八，二十一比八）。
      鏖战四局　赢得冠军
    容国团同西多的决战，是一场激烈的比赛。这场比赛成了几天来在多特蒙德进行的世界乒乓球锦标赛的最吸引观众的一场比赛。
    决赛时间到来的时候，西多和容国团上场，两位名将相遇，各人都施展了各种本领，争取胜利。
    比赛第一局一开始，容国团就展开了猛烈的攻势，运用拉左杀右和发球抢攻的战术，以七比三领先，西多这时加强了反攻，追成八平，从此两人互相进攻各有得失，分数拉锯距离一直保持在两分之内，从九平、十二平、十六平到十七平，这时西多反攻得分，容国团又攻球失误，以十九比二十一先负一局。
    第二局容国团总结了上一局失败的原因，加强了拉球力量，并注意了西多的反攻。四平以后，容国团的杀球越来越准，同时也把西多的反攻压住，使对方陷于被动。六比四时，容国团猛攻对方右角，接着来一个看起来像是放短球而实际是扣杀的假动作又获一分。这个球打得非常漂亮，博得了全场热烈的掌声。容国团在这一局一直居于上风，长短兼施，左右逢源，西多虽竭力抢救，但仍以十二比二十一的比数失败，被容国团扳回一局成一平。
    第三局西多拼命加转和逼角，不时伺机反攻，以七比四领先。但容国团保持极清醒的头脑，沉着应战，丝毫不乱，发球抢攻，马上追回。容国团的发球变化多端，屡屡得分，同时他的上旋拉球使西多很难反攻，在十三比八（容国团领先）时，西多找到机会连攻四板，都被容国团左推右攻，连削带打，压回去，因此，容国团以二十一比十五又胜一局。这时容国团已经三局两胜，处于优势。
    第四局中，容国团信心更强，西多最拿手的逼角反攻在容国团的控制下，已无法施展。西多这时主要是在枱外退守，中间虽有突击，但多不准。而容国团这时的战术却非常灵活，拉、扣、搓、吊，得心应手，打来既稳又准，终于以二十一比十四获得最后胜利。比赛结束后，容国团和西多两人紧紧握手，彼此流露着亲切友谊的情感。
    随后容国团走向授奖台，领受了世界男子单打冠军的奖杯——圣布赖德·瓦斯特杯。陪同他去授奖台的是获得亚军的西多以及并列第三名的日本的荻村和美国的迈耳斯。
    容国团在这次决赛中，战斗意志很强，信心充沛，因而充分发挥了自己的技术能力，并且他吸取了过去同西多对垒的经验教训，灵活运用了多种多样的战术，因此这位青年选手终于为祖国争取到了高度的荣誉。
      虚心学习　继续锻炼
    在决赛后，新华社记者访问了容国团。他对记者说：“我所以在这次比赛中能够取得胜利，根本原因是平时党对我的培养、教育和祖国社会主义建设大跃进对我的鼓舞。”接着，他谈到由于西多的竞技状态很好，比赛前他有些担心。他说：“但是，当我想到我是在为祖国争取荣誉时，终于鼓起了勇气，加强了信心，沉着应战，正常地发挥了自己的技术。在比赛中除第一局有些紧张外，整个说来头脑比较冷静。在战术运用方面，由于我们球队集体力量的帮助，自己也吸取了过去同西多比赛中的经验教训，因而在临场时运用得比较自如。”
    容国团最后说：“我虽然获得了世界冠军的光荣称号，但是我还很年青，在政治上、技术上还需要不断地提高。今后，我一定要防止骄傲自满，继续努力锻炼，虚心学习，和同志们一道为祖国争取更多的荣誉。”
    容国团的胜利，有力地表明了我国体育运动的蓬勃发展和飞跃进步的情况。
    我国男女乒乓球队从1953年3月才开始参加世界乒乓球锦标赛。当时，我国男子队被评为世界第一级第十名，女子队被评为第二级第三名。可是，才经过了短短的六年，我国男女乒乓球队在这次世界锦标赛中，都已被评为第一级第三名。容国团在单打比赛中获得了世界冠军。参加这次世界锦标赛各项比赛的我国运动员庄家富、杨瑞华、王传耀、徐寅生、丘锺惠、孙梅英等，也都以顽强的意志击败了许多世界著名选手。这是我国体育史上辉煌的成就。它同我国的举重、田径、游泳和跳伞运动员创造的世界纪录一样放出灿烂的光辉。（附图片）
