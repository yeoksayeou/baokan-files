Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: The original copies of the three handwritten letters from the Dalai Lama to Tan Guansan, acting representative of the Central Government in Tibet and Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, before he was abducted from Lhasa by the Tibetan traitorous group on the night of March 17th, have been sent from Lhasa to Beijing. Xinhua News Agency has photographed and published them today.

The Dalai Lama's handwritten letter to General Tan Guansan on March 11th was written with a steel pen and blue ink below the Tibetan translation of General Tan Guansan's letter to the Dalai Lama on March 10th. This letter is the one mentioned in the Dalai Lama's second letter as being forwarded through Ngapoi (original photo below).

The Dalai Lama's two handwritten letters to General Tan Guansan on March 12th and 16th (original photos on the second page) were written with a black pencil on white, thin, wove paper.

In his three handwritten letters to General Tan Guansan, the Dalai Lama explained that the Tibetan traitorous group, under the guise of protecting his safety, was carrying out activities that endangered him and creating serious incidents that alienated the relationship between the Central Government and the local authorities. He was doing everything possible to deal with the situation and had been educating officials of the Tibetan local government. The day after the Dalai Lama sent his third letter (March 16th), on the night of March 17th, the traitorous group abducted the Dalai Lama from Lhasa. On the night of March 19th, the traitorous group launched a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa.

The translations of the Dalai Lama's three handwritten letters, and General Tan Guansan's three letters to the Dalai Lama on March 10th, 11th, and 15th, were published in full by Xinhua News Agency on March 29th.
