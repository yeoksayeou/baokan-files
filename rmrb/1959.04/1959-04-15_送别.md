　　Farewell
　　Dai Mengqing (Poem and Painting)
　　Crystal wine reflects the peach's red glow, many thanks for the Miao people's deep affection,
　　I wish you all success as surveyors, and we will meet again when the Sichuan-Guizhou road is completed.
　　It is a Miao custom that when guests are about to depart, they are sent out of the village gate, invited to drink farewell wine, and songs are sung, seeing them off until they are on their way. This scene was observed in the Dong Autonomous County.

　　送别
　　戴孟清　诗画
　　水晶佳酿映桃红，多谢苗家情意浓，
　　勘测祝君成好手，川黔路竣再相逢。
　　苗家风俗，客人临别时要送出寨门，请喝别酒，并唱歌，直送到上路为止。此景为侗族自治县所见。
