In his work "State and Revolution," Lenin convincingly proved that "The transition from capitalism to communism is certainly bound to yield a tremendous abundance and variety of political forms, but the essence will inevitably be the same: the dictatorship of the proletariat."

In the German Democratic Republic, in addition to the leading Socialist Unity Party of Germany, four other parties also participate in the government: the Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany, The National Democratic Party of German, the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany, and the Christian Democratic Union of Germany.

All these petty-bourgeois democratic parties, although almost all of them emerged after the war, did not appear out of thin air. They all originated from the traditional forms of national parties.

The attitude of the working class and its party towards non-proletarian strata is of decisive significance for the further development of society and the consolidation of the worker-peasant regime. Lenin said that the middle strata "cannot be expelled or suppressed, but must be reconciled with." It is possible and necessary to transform them and educate them, which can only be achieved through the long-term, slow, and prudent organizational work of the Marxist workers' party, thereby also convincing the middle strata and their representatives that developing along the socialist road is also in the interests of the majority of these strata, just as Engels said at the time that the working-class party not only represents the current interests of small commodity producers but also their long-term interests.

From this, it can be seen that the development from an anti-fascist democratic system to a people's democratic system has profound inherent regularities.

Our multi-party system reflects the actual comparison of class forces that have real contradictions between them. This contradiction is not antagonistic and can be resolved peacefully under the leadership of the working class. In the anti-fascist democratic alliance composed of various parties and mass organizations, there is a decisive factor that determines the cooperation of various parties in the alliance, that is, the common interests of all classes and strata of residents, who all hope to build socialism and defend the achievements of socialism in the anti-imperialist struggle.

Since any form of the dictatorship of the proletariat is true democracy for the vast majority of residents, the question of a multi-party system versus a one-party system is no longer a question of the nature of the regime but a question of the form of expression of the regime. This question is determined by the specific historical, national, and domestic and international conditions of each country.

In the current historical environment, it can be clearly seen that the implementation of a multi-party system under the leadership of the revolutionary working class and its party does not violate the theory and practice of the dictatorship of the proletariat. On the contrary, the multi-party system under the people's democratic system meets the requirements of creatively applying Lenin's theory of the transition from bourgeois democratic revolution to socialist revolution. The multi-party system is a method of absorbing the middle strata to participate in socialist construction. The fundamental reason for adopting this method is that in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, the interests of the working class are consistent with the current and future fundamental interests of the middle strata.

The realization of the leading role of the Marxist-Leninist party under the conditions of a multi-party system particularly requires the working-class party to become a mass party with a high degree of flexibility and thorough principles and firmness. In order to ensure that the party does not run the risk of moving towards opportunism when cooperating with petty-bourgeois democratic parties and to prevent the party's policies from being distorted by dogmatism and sectarianism, it is necessary to dialectically handle important issues in socialist construction and creatively apply Lenin's doctrines on socialist revolution, on the state and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and on the alliance of the working class with the working peasants and other non-proletarian strata.

The existence of a multi-party system reflects the development of the alliance between the working class and the peasants and other working strata. On the basis of this alliance, a part of the small and medium-sized bourgeoisie was initially attracted to participate in solving general democratic issues, and then they were attracted to participate in socialist construction.

    德意志民主共和国的多党制
    列宁在“国家与革命”这部著作中令人信服地证明：“从资本主义过渡到共产主义，当然不能不产生多种多样的政治形式，但本质必然是一个，就是无产阶级专政。”
    在德意志民主共和国，除了起领导作用的德国统一社会党外，还有四个政党也参加了政府，这就是：德国民主农民党、德国国家民主党、德国自由民主党和德国基督教民主联盟。
    所有这些小资产阶级的民主党派，虽然几乎都是战后时期产生的，但是决不是凭空出现的，它们都是从国家政党的传统形式中产生的。
    工人阶级和它的政党对待非无产者阶层的态度对于社会的进一步发展和工农政权的巩固具有决定性的意义。列宁说道，对于中等阶层“既不能驱逐，又不能镇压，必须同他们和睦相处”。可以而且必须改造他们，教育他们，这只有通过马克思主义的工人政党的长期的、缓慢的、谨慎的组织工作才能作到，从而也才能使中等阶层和他们的代表人物相信沿着社会主义道路发展也符合于这些阶层大多数人的利益，正像恩格斯当时所说的，工人阶级的政党不仅代表小商品生产者的目前利益，而且也代表他们的长远利益。
    由此可见，由反法西斯民主制度发展成人民民主制度是有深刻的内在规律性的。
    我国的多党制反映了互相之间存在着实际矛盾的阶级力量的实际对比。这种矛盾并不带有对抗性质，在工人阶级的领导下可以通过和平的途径而得到解决。在各个政党和群众团体组成的反法西斯民主联盟中包含着一个决定联盟中各个政党实行合作的决定因素，这就是各阶级和各阶层居民有共同的利益，他们都希望建设社会主义和保卫社会主义在反帝斗争中取得的成果。
    既然任何形式的无产阶级专政对于绝大多数的居民是真正的民主，所以多党制和一党制的问题已经不是政权的性质问题，而是政权的表现形式问题。这个问题是由每个国家的具体历史条件、民族条件和国内外条件来决定的。
    在当前的历史环境中，可以清楚地看到，在革命的工人阶级及其政党掌握领导权的条件下实行多党制并不违反无产阶级专政的理论和实践。恰恰相反，在人民民主制度下的多党制符合创造性地运用列宁的从资产阶级民主革命向社会主义革命过渡的理论的要求。多党制是吸收中等阶层参加社会主义建设的一种方法，采取这种方法的根本原因，就是在资本主义过渡到社会主义时期，工人阶级的利益与中等阶层的当前和未来的根本利益一致。
    在多党制的条件下实现马克思列宁主义政党的领导作用，特别要求工人阶级政党成为一个群众性的、具有高度的灵活性和彻底的原则性和坚定性的政党。为了保证党在与小资产阶级民主党派合作的时候不致产生走向机会主义的危险，防止党的政策被教条主义和宗派主义歪曲，就必须辩证地处理社会主义建设中的重要问题，创造性地运用列宁关于社会主义革命、关于国家和无产阶级专政、关于工人阶级与劳动农民和其他非无产阶级的阶层的联盟的学说。
    多党制的存在，反映着工人阶级同农民和其他劳动阶层联盟的发展。在这个联盟的基础上，一部分中小资产阶级最初被吸引来参加解决一般民主主义问题，然后再吸引他们参加社会主义建设。
