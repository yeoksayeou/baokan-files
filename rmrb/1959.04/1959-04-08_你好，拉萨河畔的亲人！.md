Hello, loved ones on the Lhasa River!

Hello! Old man rowing a yak-hide boat on the Lhasa River. You love the Norbulingka, you love the waves, you love the reflection of the Potala Palace, but—when it comes to the evil demons stirring up trouble, you raise your paddle like a sword... Hello! Tibetan youth grazing on the grasslands. You love the sheep, you love the streams, you love the mountain peaks, but—when it comes to the imperialist hounds, your left hand tightens even more on the whip! Hello! Girl sowing seeds in the farm. You love the bees, you love the flowers, you love the harvesting iron sickle, but—when it comes to the villains who do all kinds of evil, your fist is clenched big and round! Hello! Model worker who received an award while building roads. You love the hammer, you love the steel drill, you love singing the songs from Beijing, but—when it comes to the bandits who kill and set fires, your eyes immediately burst into flames! Yes! Every step of the magnificent golden palace was paved by us; every mural was painted by us. We must never let the rebels trample on it, we must never let the counter-revolutionaries smear it! Yes! Every poplar tree in the beautiful garden was planted by us; every golden roof was built by us. It must never be burned by the rebel bandits, it must never be destroyed by the reactionary groups! Look! The eagle is soaring, the peacock is spreading its tail, we are united together, our strong footsteps firmly step on the beasts in sheep's clothing; our powerful iron arms thoroughly sweep away the garbage around Barkhor Street! Look! The golden light is flashing, the rainbow is showing, we have won, we have won... Raise the highland barley wine, sing a song of victory to Beijing, to the motherland; spin the colorful apron, dance a dance of celebration for the new life to the snow-capped mountains, to all of Tibet... Greet the white doves flying from Tiananmen Square, cheer! Loved ones on the Lhasa River; jump for joy greeting the congratulatory messages flying from the heart of the motherland! In the past, our ancestors, in fortresses, in mountainous areas, at the Gyantse fort, in groups, resisted foreign aggression; today, our generation, in high mountains, on plains, in cities and villages, under the guidance of the Party, is building a new democratic and socialist home!

    你好，拉萨河畔的亲人！
    顾工你好啊！在拉萨河上，划着牛皮船的老汉。你爱林卡，你爱波浪，你爱布达拉宫的倒影，但是——一提到兴风作浪的恶魔，你举起划桨，就像举起刀剑……你好啊！在草原上，放牧的藏族少年。你爱羊群，你爱溪流，你爱山巅，但是——一提到帝国主义的猎犬，你的左手，就更握紧了皮鞭！你好啊！在农场里，播洒种籽的姑娘。你爱蜜蜂，你爱花朵，你爱收割的铁镰，但是——一提到无恶不作的坏蛋，你的拳头，就捏得又大又圆！你好啊！在筑路时，获得奖状的模范。你爱铁锤，你爱钢钎，你爱唱北京传来的歌子，但是——一提到杀人放火的匪徒，你的眼睛，就立即喷出了火焰！是啊！巍峨的金殿，每一层阶梯，都是我们铺砌的；每一幅壁画，都是我们描绘的。决不能让叛乱分子践踏，决不能让反革命涂污！是啊！美丽的花园，每一株杨树，都是我们栽种的；每一座金顶，都是我们修建的。决不能被叛匪焚烧，决不能被反动集团毁灭！看哪！雄鹰展翅了，孔雀开屏了，我们团结在一起，雄健的脚步，牢牢踏住披着羊皮的野兽；强大的铁臂，彻底扫清，八角街边的垃圾！看哪！金光闪射了，彩虹展现了，我们胜利了，胜利了……高举青稞酒，向北京，向祖国唱一支报捷的歌；旋转花围裙，向雪山，向全西藏，跳一曲欢庆新生的舞……迎着天安门前飞来的白鸽，欢呼吧！拉萨河畔的亲人；迎着从祖国心脏飞来的贺信，跳跃吧！拉萨河畔的亲人。从前，我们的祖先，在要塞，在山区，在江孜炮台，成群结队，抗击过外来的侵略；今天我们这一代在高山，在平原，在城市和乡村，在党的引导下，建设起民主、社会主义新家园！（附图片）
