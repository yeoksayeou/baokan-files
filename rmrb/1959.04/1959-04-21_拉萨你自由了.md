Lhasa, you are free
After the rebellion in the Lhasa area was quelled, the people here truly gained freedom. On April 15th, over 20,000 residents of Lhasa—including serfs who had endured cruel exploitation all their lives and patriotic lamas—freely took to the streets to hold demonstrations and rallies denouncing the rebel elements and condemning the traitorous crimes of the reactionary upper class. This was unprecedented in Tibetan history.

When the bandits were entrenched in Lhasa, it was, for a time, practically a city of terror. At that time, the rebel elements organized a counter-revolutionary organization called "Four Rivers, Six Ranges" (Note: "Four Rivers" and "Six Ranges" are geographical concepts in Tibetan Buddhism. This counter-revolutionary organization was named after them, implying that it wanted to include all Tibetans in this counter-revolutionary organization). The "Defend Religion Army" was its armed organization. These rebel elements recruited troops and bought horses everywhere in Lhasa, secretly conducted reactionary gatherings, and secretly communicated with traitorous elements who had fled to Kalimpong. After May and June of last year, the arrogance of the lurking rebel elements became even more rampant. They openly established "base areas" in the Shannan area, set up drop zones near Zhegu, accepted assistance from imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek cliques, and established so-called "Political and Religious Volunteer Army Barracks," destroying highways, attacking vehicles, harming the people, and ambushing the People's Liberation Army and cadres working in Tibet. The bandits even surrounded the CCP Tibet Working Committee and various agencies stationed in Lhasa with guns on more than one occasion. The People's Liberation Army soldiers complained, "We are being too lenient with these guys!" But in order to wait for the rebel elements to come to their senses and to consider the overall situation, they repeatedly tolerated the rebels' many unreasonable provocations.

At that time, rumors were rife in the streets of Lhasa, and people were panicked. Residents dispersed their property to the countryside. The market was sluggish, and merchants were unwilling to purchase goods. The price of a gallon of kerosene accumulated in Yatung once plummeted from three or four yuan to just over one yuan, but it still could not be sold. On the postal routes and highways from Lhasa via Yatung to Kalimpong, there was a constant stream of mules, horses, and vehicles, as reactionary elements of the Tibetan upper class transported large amounts of wealth they had squeezed from the Tibetan people abroad.

On March 10th, the rebellion planned by the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper class finally broke out. These rebel elements chose a path of self-destruction, while the Tibetan people have since gained a new life.

On the day of the Lhasa citizens' demonstration on April 15th, a parade of former "despicable people" appeared on the streets. As they marched forward, they shouted slogans supporting the Communist Party and the Central People's Government. Before March 10th, they were all unkempt, poorly clothed, and begging on the streets. Now, with the help of the Lhasa Military Control Commission, they have found employment opportunities and are eating butter tea and tsampa. An old man with crutches said, "Today is the first time we feel like human beings, the same as others!"

An old man in the parade shouted slogans while wiping away tears. He was a worker in the construction engineering department named Yunzhu. For the past few decades, he had been wandering around Tibet with his family, never having had a full meal. In the Lhasa rebellion, he suffered another misfortune when his wife and a nine-month-old child were killed by the bandits. At that time, Yunzhu was in so much pain that he wanted to jump into the Lhasa River and drown himself, but fortunately, the People's Liberation Army soldiers persuaded and comforted him and helped him find a job. This time, he told others, "My wife suffered so much with me for so many years. We hoped for such a day. If she hadn't died, how happy she would be!"

The former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper class insisted on reactionary rule, and even the smallest symbols of progress in life aroused their fear and hatred. In the past, Tibetan children would be beaten for wearing red scarves, and lamas would be punished for wearing badges with Chairman Mao's image. A little girl named Tenzin Quzhen was severely beaten on the street two years ago for wearing a red scarf. In 1956, when the central delegation came to Lhasa to participate in the celebration of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, it gave badges with Chairman Mao's image to some lamas. Many lamas were beaten for wearing the badges. Now, people are free. In the grand parade on April 15th, a group of students from Lhasa Middle School, wearing red scarves and playing waist drums, happily passed through Barkhor Street. Patriotic lamas also put on the badges with Chairman Mao's image that they had secretly hidden for more than two years and joined the parade.

A patriotic lama from Drepung Monastery named Jumei Renzeng was a member of the presidium of the mass rally of over 20,000 people held in Lhasa on the 15th to quell the rebellion. This lama expressed the wishes of all patriotic lamas, saying, "Our Buddhism advocates kindness and should not harm the people, destroy highways, burn bridges, or take guns to fight the Liberation Army." He said that he had personally seen the Liberation Army protect religion, and only those rebel elements in monks' robes truly violated the tenets of Buddhism. The rebel elements not only violated Buddhist doctrines but were also poisonous snakes harming the Tibetan people. Jumei Renzeng also complained to reporters about his tragic experience. His father and younger brother were killed by rebel elements in Shannan in October last year. He himself was brutally beaten with more than two hundred leather whips by rebel elements for calling them bandits. The scars on his legs have not yet healed. Jumei Renzeng firmly said, "In order to completely quell the rebellion, I will dedicate everything I have."

The rebel elements here indeed receive no sympathy from any righteous person. Langdun Tsering Wangmo, a woman from the upper class and vice-chairman of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation, told reporters, "As a mother of four children, I eagerly hope for peace. In the past few years, a few bad elements in the Tibetan upper class, colluding with imperialism, have constantly undermined the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, not only frantically provoking the PLA troops stationed in Tibet, but also arbitrarily extorting ordinary people. In the days before the Lhasa rebellion, rebel elements forcibly stayed in the homes of many Tibetans in Lhasa, forcing them to provide food and lodging, and subjected them to all kinds of insults. When the bandits fled, they also stole the bicycle from our home."

Langdun Tsering Wangmo also participated in the parade on the 15th. She told reporters, "At the symposiums held by the Patriotic Women's Federation in recent days, many women have resolutely demanded that the People's Liberation Army completely quell the rebellion so that the Tibetan people can truly live a happy life." When reporters asked her what kind of happy life she wanted, she said, "Last winter, when I visited Beijing and many large cities in central and southern China, I saw that many factories and cultural facilities had been built there after liberation, which made me feel envious and pained. The construction in the Tibetan area is far behind that of other ethnic groups. I believe that after the rebellion is quelled, the Tibetan area will gradually be built as beautifully as other parts of the motherland."

Another Tibetan upper-class woman, Chiley Deqin, a member of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation, told reporters, "Before the rebel elements in Lhasa carried out the rebellion, they repeatedly forced and threatened women in our families to attend meetings, saying that they wanted to organize a 'petition.' My twenty-one-year-old eldest son was also deceived and taken away by the rebel elements. My son was studying scriptures at Drepung Monastery and was often subjected to beatings and scolding by the rebel elements, who insisted that he oppose the Central People's Government. But my son has never expressed any hostility towards the Central People's Government at home. On February 12th, my son came home, and later the rebel elements said that there were important scriptures to be recited and tricked him into going to Drepung Monastery, and then they never let him come back."

Chiley Deqin said, "I hope my son can escape from the bandits as soon as possible and return to my side. At the same time, I also hope that those who have been deceived and forced to participate in the rebellion, like my son, can recognize the great righteousness as soon as possible, break away from the bandits, and start anew."

### 拉萨你自由了

专栏：

    拉萨你自由了
    拉萨地区的叛乱被平息以后，这里的人民真正得到了自由。4月15日，拉萨两万多居民——包括那些一生忍受残酷剥削的农奴和爱国的喇嘛，自由地走上街头，举行声讨叛乱分子的示威游行和集会，控诉上层反动集团的叛国罪行。这在西藏历史上是从来没有过的事。
    当叛匪潜踞在拉萨的时候，这里曾有一段时间简直变成了一座恐怖的城市。当时叛乱分子在这里组织了一个称为“四水六岗”的反革命组织（按：“四水”和“六岗”都是西藏佛教中的地理概念，这个反革命组织以此命名，其含意是想把所有藏民包含在这个反革命组织之内），“卫教军”是它的武装组织。这些叛乱分子在拉萨到处招兵买马，秘密进行反动的集会活动，并且同逃亡噶伦堡的叛国分子暗中往来。到去年5、6月以后，潜藏的叛乱分子的气焰更加嚣张，他们公开在山南地区建立“根据地”，在哲古宗一带设立空投场，接受帝国主义和蒋介石集团的援助；并且成立所谓“政教志愿军兵营”，破坏公路，攻打汽车，残害人民，伏击人民解放军和进藏工作干部。叛匪甚至不止一次地持枪包围中共西藏工委和驻拉萨各机关。人民解放军战士们抱怨地说：“对这些家伙太宽大了！”可是为了等待叛乱分子的觉悟，为了顾全大局，他们一再忍让了叛匪许多次的无理挑衅。
    当时，拉萨街上谣言纷纷，人心惶惶，居民们纷纷把财物疏散到乡下。市面生意萧条，商人不肯进货，积压在亚东的煤油一加仑的售价曾经一度由三、四元猛跌到一元多，还是卖不出去。在从拉萨经亚东到噶伦堡的驿道和公路线上，经常出现络绎不绝的骡马和车辆，那是西藏上层反动分子在把他们从西藏人民身上榨取的大批财物运往国外。
    3月10日，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团策划的叛乱终于爆发了。这些叛乱分子选择了自取灭亡的道路，而西藏人民却从此获得了新生。
    在4月15日拉萨市民倾城而出举行示威游行的那天，街头上出现了一队由原来的“贱人”组成的游行队伍，他们一面前进，一面高呼拥护共产党和中央人民政府的口号。在3月10日以前，他们还个个蓬头垢面，衣不蔽体，在街头上向行人磕头乞讨。现在，他们在拉萨军管会的帮助下得到了就业的机会，吃上了酥油和?粑。一个手扶拐杖的老人说：“今天我们第一次感到自己是人，是和别人同样的人！”
  游行队伍里有一个老人一面喊口号，一面揩眼泪。他是建筑工程处的工人，名叫云珠。在过去的几十年里，他一直携带家小在西藏各地流浪，从来没有吃过一顿饱饭。在拉萨叛乱中他又遭到了不幸，他的妻子和一个九个月的孩子被叛匪打死了。当时云珠痛不欲生，几次想跳进拉萨河淹死，幸亏人民解放军战士劝导他，安慰他，又帮助他找到了工作。这次他告诉别人说：“我的妻子跟我受了多少年的苦，我们盼望有这么一天。要是她不死，该多么高兴啊！”
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团坚持反动统治，甚至连生活中一些微小的进步的象征都引起他们的恐惧和仇恨。在过去，藏族孩子戴红领巾是会遭受殴打的，喇嘛佩带镶着毛主席像的纪念章也会受到惩罚。一个名叫丹增曲珍的小姑娘，两年前因为佩带红领巾曾在街上被反动分子毒打了一顿。1956年中央代表团来拉萨参加庆祝西藏自治区筹委会成立时，曾经把镶着毛主席像的纪念章赠给一些喇嘛，许多喇嘛因为佩戴纪念章遭到了毒打。现在，人们自由了。在4月15日的大游行中，拉萨中学的一群学生戴着红领巾，敲着腰鼓，兴高彩烈地穿过八角街。爱国喇嘛们也重新戴上他们偷偷藏了两年多的镶着毛主席像的纪念章参加游行。
    哲蚌寺的一位名叫居美仁增的爱国喇嘛，是拉萨市15日举行的两万多人平叛大会的主席团成员。这个喇嘛表达了所有爱国喇嘛的心愿，他说：“我们佛教主张善良，不应该残害人民，破坏公路，烧毁桥梁，拿枪打解放军。”他说，他亲眼看到解放军保护宗教，只有那些披着袈裟的叛乱分子才真正违背了佛教的教规教义。叛乱分子不仅违背了佛教教义，也是残害藏族人民的毒蛇。居美仁增并向记者控诉了他的悲惨遭遇，他的父亲和弟弟，去年10月间在山南被叛乱分子杀害了，他本人因为骂过叛乱分子是土匪，结果被叛乱分子毒打了二百多皮鞭。他两条腿上的伤疤到今天还没有痊愈。居美仁增坚决地说：“为了彻底平息叛乱，我要献出我的一切。”
    叛乱分子在这里的确得不到任何正义人士的同情。上层妇女、拉萨市爱国妇女联谊会副主任朗顿·泽仁旺姆向记者说：“作为一个有着四个子女的母亲，我热切地祈望和平。过去几年来，少数西藏上层坏分子，勾结帝国主义，不断破坏和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，不但疯狂地向人民解放军驻藏部队挑衅，而且任意敲诈勒索普通老百姓。在拉藏叛乱前几天，叛乱分子强住在拉萨市许多藏民家中，强迫藏民供给食宿，并对藏民进行种种侮辱。叛匪临逃走时，还抢走了我们家中的自行车”。
    朗顿·泽仁旺姆15日也参加了游行，她向记者说：“在爱国妇女联谊会最近几天举行的座谈会上，许多妇女都坚决要求人民解放军彻底平息叛乱，使西藏人民真正过幸福的生活。”当记者问她愿意过怎样的幸福生活时，她说：“去年冬季我到北京和华中、华南许多大城市参观时，看到那里解放后建设了许多工厂和文化设施，这使我感到羡慕而且痛心，藏族地区的建设远远落后于各兄弟民族。我相信，在叛乱平息后，西藏地区也一定会逐步地建设得像祖国其他地方一样美丽。”
    另一位藏族上层妇女、拉萨市爱国妇女联谊会委员赤列德钦对记者说：“在拉萨市叛乱分子进行叛乱前，曾经几次强迫威胁我们家庭妇女去开会，说什么要组织‘请愿’。我的二十一岁的大儿子也是被叛乱分子欺骗带走的。我的儿子在哲蚌寺学经，经常受到叛乱分子的拷打责骂，叛乱分子还硬要他反对中央人民政府。可是我儿子在家里从来没有表示过对中央人民政府有敌对情绪。2月12日，我的儿子还来过家里，后来叛乱分子说有重要的经要念，骗他去哲蚌寺以后，就再也没有让他回来。”
    赤列德钦说，我希望我的儿子能够早日从叛匪那里脱逃，回到我身边来。同时我也希望叛乱分子中有像我儿子一样被欺骗强迫参加的人，都能够早日认明大义，脱离叛匪，重新做人。新华社驻拉萨记者（附图片）
