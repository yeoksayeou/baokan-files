    Capital Drama Circles Discuss Issues of Improving and Developing Drama Art

    Xinhua News Agency News: The Chinese Dramatists Association recently held three consecutive drama art symposiums in Beijing, with enthusiastic discussions on the issues of improving and developing drama art. More than seventy playwrights, directors, actors, and stage workers participated in the symposiums.

    Participants believed that since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, drama work has made great achievements, with the emergence of many excellent plays, a general improvement in the performance level of actors, and an increasingly prosperous scene in drama art, winning more and more audiences and playing a certain role in educating and encouraging the people. Drama is the most powerful weapon for expressing real life. In the future, we must pay attention to the development of drama, vigorously improve the ideological and artistic quality of drama, make this weapon sharper, better serve socialist construction, and more fully meet the growing needs of the audience.

    Participants believed that it is necessary to first improve the quality of drama creation. Guo Moruo said that to improve the level of drama, writers, directors, and actors need to work closely together, but the main and basic problem is to produce a large number of good scripts. Drama must be realistic, but at the same time, it must add some romanticism, so that realism and romanticism can be well combined. Xia Yan, Yang Hansheng, and Chen Baichen believed that some current drama creations lack romanticism and the foundation of realism is not deep enough, therefore lacking profound ideological content and failing to shake people's hearts. Playwrights must continue to solve the problems of thought, life, and skill, arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism, and participate more deeply in the lives and struggles of the people. Cao Yu said that if separated from the thoughts and feelings of the people, skills are just "tricks." Playwrights should study what is called "compact," "concise," and "refined," and what is called "shaking people's hearts" from the audience's tears, laughter, and applause. Chen Qitong, Wu Xue, and others believed that some current drama creations lack generalization and artistic quality, and lack the due dramatic and narrative quality. It is necessary to advocate writing about characters, not just seeing events without seeing people, and be good at finding contradictions and conflicts with a realistic basis.

    Participants believed that it is necessary to strive to improve the performance art level of drama from all aspects, such as directing, acting, and stage art. Ouyang Yuqian said that it is necessary to attach importance to improving the level of directors. Drama directors should strive to have high talent and knowledge, create national forms of drama performance, and highly cooperate and respect playwrights, actors, and stage workers. Li Bozhao believed that how to create the image of heroic figures in dramas still requires great efforts, and it is necessary to beautify the stage image of workers and peasants. The stage art, costumes, music, and acting skills of drama should draw on traditions to enrich their expressiveness. Ye Zi said that actors must strengthen the training of internal and external performance art. Without external expressiveness, relying solely on internal emotions cannot effectively portray characters, and actors must undergo physical training. Lu Xi said that in addition to learning from life, books, and tradition, actors must also strive to overcome shortcomings in performance. Speaking is a powerful weapon for drama performance, and actors should constantly hone it. Yan Zheng said that drama schools in the past also neglected physical and line training for actors, but this has now begun to change. Yu Cun, Geng Zhen, Diao Guangqin, and many others believed that drama should learn from the repertoire system of opera, determine a batch of famous Chinese and foreign dramas, and constantly process and perform them. This can not only improve stage art and summarize good performance experience, but also quickly train young actors.

    Everyone talked about how to learn and inherit traditions. Yang Hansheng, Ouyang Yuqian, Lao She, Xia Yan, Diao Guangqin, and others believed that attention should be paid to summarizing and learning from the revolutionary tradition and artistic experience of Chinese drama in the past fifty years; to learn from the opera tradition of lively scenes, concise and prominent character portrayal, and good use of comedy expression methods, and other strengths; to learn from advanced foreign drama creation, especially the outstanding artistic achievements of Soviet drama; and to especially learn from the spirit of continuous diligent study and hard practice of the older generation of opera circles and their serious and meticulous attitude towards art. Chinese drama and opera have been together for decades, and have consciously or unconsciously absorbed many traditional things, and these experiences should be well summarized.

    Regarding the issue of drama criticism, Ouyang Shanzun, Chen Baichen, and many others believed that critics have a great responsibility in improving and developing drama art. Critics should write more constructive criticism, pay more attention to the party's literary and artistic guidelines and policies, encourage new creations, and avoid rudeness and exaggeration; it is also necessary to promote counter-criticism and debate, and encourage everyone to dare to carry out artistic experiments and creations. Yang Hansheng, Ouyang Yuqian, and others said that the diversification of performance forms should be advocated through commentary work, and different schools of drama should be promoted to promote the blooming of a hundred flowers in drama art. Different styles have begun to appear in major theaters in Beijing, and their development should be encouraged and cultivated.

    The symposium was chaired by Tian Han, chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association.

### 提高思想质量和艺术质量  让话剧武器更加锋利  首都话剧界讨论提高和发展话剧艺术问题

    提高思想质量和艺术质量
    让话剧武器更加锋利
    首都话剧界讨论提高和发展话剧艺术问题
    据新华社讯　中国戏剧家协会最近在北京连续举行了三次话剧艺术座谈会，热烈讨论了提高和发展话剧艺术的问题。参加座谈会的有剧作家、导演、演员、舞台工作者七十多人。
    大家认为解放后，特别是去年大跃进以来，话剧工作有很大成绩，出现了许多优秀剧目，演员的表演水平普遍有所提高，话剧艺术呈现出日益繁荣的景象，赢得了越来越多的观众，对教育鼓舞人民起了一定的作用。话剧是表现现实生活最有力的武器，今后必须重视话剧的发展，大力提高话剧的思想质量和艺术质量，使这一武器更加锋利，更好地为社会主义建设服务，更充分地满足观众日益增长的需要。
    大家认为，必须首先提高话剧的创作质量。郭沫若说，要提高话剧水平，需要作家、导演、演员密切协作，但主要的、基本的问题还是要大量生产好剧本。话剧必须是现实主义的，但同时要增加些浪漫主义，使现实主义与浪漫主义很好的结合，夏衍、阳翰笙、陈白尘认为，现在有的话剧创作浪漫主义不够，现实主义的基础也不够深，因此缺乏深刻的思想性，不能震撼人心。剧作家要继续解决思想、生活和技巧的问题，要用马列主义武装自己，要更深入地参与人民群众的生活和斗争。曹禺说，脱离了人民群众的思想感情，技巧便是“把戏”，剧作家要从观众的哭、笑和掌声中去研究什么叫“紧凑”、“简洁”、“洗练”，什么叫“震撼人心”。陈其通、吴雪等认为，目前有的话剧创作概括力不强、艺术性不高，缺乏应有的戏剧性、故事性，要提倡写人物，不要见事不见人，要善于寻找有现实基础的矛盾、冲突。
    大家认为，必须从导演、演员、舞台美术等各方面，努力提高话剧的表演艺术水平。欧阳予倩说，要重视提高导演的水平，话剧导演应该努力使自己具有很高的才、学识，创造话剧表演的民族形式，要和剧作家、演员、舞台工作者高度协作和互相尊重。李伯钊认为，如何在话剧中创造英雄人物的形象，还需要作巨大的努力，一定要美化工农群众的舞台形象。话剧的舞台美术、服装、音乐、演技都要向传统借鉴来丰富自己的表现力。叶子说，演员必须加强内在、外在表演艺术的锻炼，没有外在的表现力，光靠内在感情也不能有力地刻划人物，演员一定要进行形体的锻炼。路曦说，演员除了要向生活、向书本、向传统学习，还要努力克服表演上的缺点。讲话是话剧表演的有力武器，演员应经常磨练它。严正说，戏剧学校过去培养演员也比较忽视形体和台词的训练，现在已开始扭转。于村、耿震、刁光覃等许多人都认为话剧应该学习戏曲的保留剧目制度，确定一批中外名剧，不断加工上演，这样既可以提高舞台艺术、总结好的表演经验，又能较快地培养青年演员。
    大家都谈到如何学习和继承传统的问题。阳翰笙、欧阳予倩、老舍、夏衍、刁光覃等认为要注意总结和学习我国话剧五十年来的革命传统和艺术经验；要学习戏曲传统中场子活泼、刻划人物性格简练突出和善于运用喜剧表现方法等等特长；要学习外国先进的戏剧创造，特别是苏联话剧的卓越艺术成就；还特别要学习戏曲界老前辈那种不断勤学苦练的精神和对待艺术严肃认真、一丝不苟的态度。我国话剧和戏曲相处了几十年，有意无意地已吸收了不少传统的东西，应很好总结这些经验。
    关于戏剧批评问题，欧阳山尊、陈白尘等许多人认为，提高和发展话剧艺术，批评家有很大的责任，批评家要多写建设性的批评，多注意党的文艺方针、政策，鼓励新的创造，避免粗暴与浮夸；还要提倡反批评和争论，鼓励大家勇于进行艺术上的尝试和创造。阳翰笙、欧阳予倩等说，要通过评论工作提倡表演形式的多样化，倡导话剧形成不同流派，以促进话剧艺术的百花齐放。北京各大剧院开始出现了不同的风格，应鼓励和培植它们的发展。
    座谈会是由中国戏剧家协会主席田汉主持的。
