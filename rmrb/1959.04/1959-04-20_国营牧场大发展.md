Great Development of State-Run Ranches

　　This newspaper reports that a new batch of state-run ranches has been established on the vast grasslands of Qinghai Province. With the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958, the number of state-run ranches in Qinghai Province has increased from seventeen in 1957 to seventy-four now. The number of various kinds of livestock has increased from 189,123 to 2,418,455, accounting for 18.8% of the total number of livestock in the province.

    State-run ranches have demonstrated enormous superiority in production. According to statistics from twenty-two ranches, in addition to the transfer and purchase of 329,000 head of livestock, a total of 94,000 head of various kinds of livestock have been bred, the vast majority of which are excellent breeds. The lambs born from the breeding sheep flock at the Huangcheng Sheep Farm in Menyuan have pure white and soft wool, and can be bred into new varieties with good quality and suitable for the high and cold areas of Qinghai within one or two years. The Datong Sheep Farm has achieved great results in improving local horses and yaks. The two-year-old hybrid horses cultivated at this sheep farm are robust and the size of local adult horses.

    While developing production, state-run ranches have also helped local herdsmen carry out various tasks. Ranches such as Sanjiaocheng, Menyuan, and Datong have helped local herdsmen with livestock breeding, disease prevention and treatment, land reclamation, and grass harvesting, and have trained veterinarians, animal husbandry, mechanical, and other technical personnel for the herdsmen. This year, the Menyuan Horse Farm also opened a training class on stallion feeding and management, attracting local cadres and herdsmen to participate, which has won praise from the herdsmen.

　　国营牧场大发展
　　本报讯　青海省辽阔的草原上，新建了一批国营牧场。随着1958年的生产大跃进，青海省的国营牧场由1957年的十七处发展到现在的七十四处。各类牲畜由十八万九千一百二十三头发展到二百四十一万八千四百五十五头，占全省牲畜总数的18.8％。
    国营牧场在生产上显示出巨大的优越性。根据二十二个牧场的统计，除调入和购入三十二万九千头牲畜外，共繁殖各类牲畜九万四千头，其中极大多数都是优良品种。亹源皇城羊场的育种羊群所生羔羊，毛色纯白、细软，在一、二年内就可以育成质量好而且适合青海高寒地区的新品种。大通羊场在改良当地马和牦牛工作上收效极大，这个羊场培殖的两岁杂种马，马驹体格魁梧，大小相当于当地成年马。
    国营牧场在发展生产的同时，还帮助各地牧民开展了各项工作。三角城、亹源、大通等牧场帮助当地牧民进行牲畜配种、防治疾病、开荒、打草，并为牧民训练兽医、畜牧、机械等技术人员。今年亹源马场还开设了种马饲养管理训练班，吸收当地干部和牧民参加，博得了牧民群众的好评。
