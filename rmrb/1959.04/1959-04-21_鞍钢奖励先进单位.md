Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, April 19th: Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang) held a representative meeting of advanced collectives and advanced producers from the 13th to the 17th of this month, summarizing and exchanging advanced experiences, and rewarding a number of "pace-setters" to promote the continued leap forward in production. Among the "pace-setters" awarded were the No. 9 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel's Ironmaking Plant, the Youth Solidarity Furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Steelmaking Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Blooming Mill and Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and the No. 41 electric shovel team of the Dong Anshan Iron Mine.

This representative meeting was also a skills competition. Representatives of Anshan Iron and Steel's various steel armies, with even more vigorous enthusiasm, proposed new goals for struggle in order to better complete the production tasks for the second quarter, challenged and responded to each other, and vowed to push the high-yield and high-quality red flag competition to a new climax. Shen Yuanzhang, vice chairman of the trade union of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, on behalf of all the factory's workers, read out the competition conditions to the workers of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant. He said with confidence: "Our plant's goal for the second quarter is to achieve an operating rate of 89.5% and a utilization coefficient of 10.74 for open-hearth furnaces." Representatives from Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Steelmaking Plant put forward specific goals and effective measures, and responded to the challenge from the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant. Representatives from the Dagushan Mine proposed to the workers of the Dong Anshan Mine that they carry out a friendly competition in terms of output and quality; representatives from the Dong Anshan Iron Mine immediately accepted the challenge, guaranteeing that the daily output of sintered ore in the second quarter would be increased from 5,000 tons in the past to 6,000 tons, supporting the great leap forward in blast furnace production.
