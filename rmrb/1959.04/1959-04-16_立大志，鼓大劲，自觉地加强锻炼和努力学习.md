　　Aspire to Greatness, Exert Great Effort, Consciously Strengthen Exercise and Study Hard
　　Liu Shunyuan, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　Historical development always sees the later surpass the former. The younger generation will be stronger than the older generation in the future, people today do better than people in the past, and people in the future will be even better at doing things than people today. Humans have undergone several social form changes. Everyone who has read the history of social development knows that human society has progressed from primitive communism to slave society, from slave society to feudal society, from feudal society to capitalism, from capitalism to socialism, and then to communism. Compared with the past, each new social form is getting better and better, both materially and spiritually. All this shows that the later must surpass the former. This is the main aspect. Anyone who does not recognize this is not in line with the laws of social development and will make mistakes.

　　To surpass the former, first of all, we must learn from the people of the past, from adults and the elderly.

　　The general trend of social development is that the later surpasses the former, but for specific individuals, young people are not necessarily stronger than older people, and they may not necessarily surpass them. To surpass them, we must first learn from the people of the past, from adults and the elderly. We advocate valuing the present over the past, believing that things today are better than things in the past, but this does not mean否定(fouding, negative) the past or discarding adults and the elderly. Not only can we not discard them, but we must also learn from them. If we don't learn their good things and don't develop on the basis of what they have already achieved, it will be a waste of labor, we will take detours, and it will be impossible to surpass them. Many things are like this. For example, there are many tall buildings now that are built very well, but historically, there were no tall buildings early on. Before tall buildings were single-story houses, and in the earliest days, they were nests built of wood. Transportation is also like this. Now there are ships, trams, trains, and airplanes. In the past, there were wheelbarrows and wooden sailing boats. This all shows that the development of anything always progresses from simple to complex, from low-level to high-level. Without simplicity, there is no complexity, and without low-level, there is no high-level. If we don't accept the creations of our predecessors and don't continue to develop on the basis of their existing creations, it will be difficult to surpass them. In October 1920, Lenin gave a speech at the Third All-Russian Congress of the Komsomol, in which he said that the task of youth is "to study." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 31, page 250) The younger generation must study hard. Don't think that since the development of history is that the later surpasses the former, every young person is naturally excellent and there is no need to learn from the past or from adults and the elderly.

　　Everyone should not understand learning from the "past" as simply "valuing the past and belittling the present." This understanding of the problem is harmful. China has had national essenceism and restorationism. Those old gentlemen, when they spoke, it was all about Yao, Shun, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, saying that they were all sages, that they were the best, and that today is not as good as the past, that the world is getting worse and worse. They fundamentally looked down on young people, saying that young people are "beardless on the lips and unreliable in their work." This is "valuing the past and belittling the present." This is fundamentally wrong. The ruling class is also like this. They are afraid of revolution and always want their rule to last forever, so they always say that young people are no good and try every possible way to打击 (daji, crack down on, suppress) the enthusiasm of young people. We are advocates of continuous revolution and want to promote the progress of history. We believe that young people are capable and that the later will surpass the former. Last year, on "May Fourth" Day, the People's Daily had an editorial called "Both Red and Expert, the Later Surpasses the Former," which talked about many young people in history who had done great things, mentioning that Li Shimin of the Tang Dynasty became a commander-in-chief at the age of eighteen, and Yue Fei of the Song Dynasty established the Yue Family Army at the age of twenty. This was to encourage the enthusiasm of young people and also to use the facts of historical development to prove the principle that the later surpasses the former. Regarding the general trend of historical development and the generations of new people under this general trend, we should look at it this way, and we should be confident that the later will surpass the former. However, understanding this issue should not be completely biased to one side, discarding all of the "old." For example, some young people think that things of the past are worthless, that there is no need to learn from adults and the elderly, and that the elderly are all "rotten wood that cannot be carved." That is completely wrong. It seems that clarifying this issue and understanding the relationship between youth and adulthood and old age dialectically is very important for us to educate young people and for the growth of young people. Otherwise, it is easy to make young people arrogant and conceited, like being drunk, floating all day long, which is harmful.

　　Must grow up in various contradictions and struggles, must undergo strict exercise.

　　When a person becomes飘飘然 (piaopiaoran, elated, lighthearted) all day long, he will not pay attention to study and exercise. In fact, anyone must grow up in various contradictions and struggles, and must undergo exercise, especially young people. The stricter the exercise, the more developed the intelligence (often including physical strength) generally is. This is like this: Flowers and plants placed in a greenhouse, not hit by rain, not blown by strong winds, not frozen by severe cold, not heated by extreme heat, grow with lush branches and green leaves, delicate and graceful; but once in the outdoors, encountering storms, they wither. Weeds are different. They squat outside all day long, blown by wind and rain, cold and hot, used to it, and afraid of nothing. When winter is really too cold, it temporarily hides in the mud, and in spring it emerges again, still alive, just like the ancient Chinese poem says: "Wildfire cannot burn it out, spring breeze blows it back to life." People who have achieved something in history have all undergone strict exercise and suffered a lot. This was true in the past, and it will be true in the future; this is true for an individual, and it is true for a revolutionary class; this is true for the Chinese revolution, and it is true for the revolutions of all socialist countries. Taking the situation of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army as an example, initially there were not many people, only broadswords,土枪 (tuqiang, home made rifles), and spears, not even rifles. Later, there were only millet and rifles, but the enemies were Japanese imperialism, American imperialism, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, who were狡猾 (jiaohua, crafty, cunning) and had 洋枪洋炮 (yangqiang yangpao, foreign guns and cannons). We had many difficulties, but difficulties can exercise people, forcing people to think of ways. If there are no guns, get the enemy's guns. If there is no money, mobilize the masses to fight and produce at the same time. The more ways there are, the bigger the队伍 (duiwu, contingent, team, troops) gets, and the stronger the force becomes. As a result, in less than thirty years, all these reactionaries were defeated, and we became invincible giants. Humans are the most intelligent of all things, with infinite potential, able to withstand all kinds of disasters, and the more磨炼 (molian, temper oneself, steel oneself) , the greater the ability. We all know that Sun Wukong is not a simple character. On the road to the Tang monk's pilgrimage for scriptures, he defeated many demons and monsters. He once made a great disturbance in the Heavenly Palace and was caught by Taishang Laojun and placed in the Bagua furnace to煉 (lian, refine) for forty-nine days, thinking that he would turn into脓血 (nongxue, pus and blood), but in the end, he just had a little怕烟 (payan, afraid of smoke) in his eyes, but he炼 (lian, refined) a "fiery golden eye" that could see through the ever-changing illusions of demons and monsters. Sun Wukong in Journey to the West was鍛煉 (duanlian, tempered, trained), not grown in a greenhouse. This is a very good typical example.

　　It is worth noting that when people are not very conscious, they often hope to grow in a greenhouse. They hope to be supported, cheered, and applauded everywhere. They are very happy when they get a red flag or a certificate of merit. At home, they always like their mother and don't like their father very much. The old saying goes, "Stern father,慈母 (cimu, loving mother)," and the father is generally stricter than the mother, so they don't like him very much. When they participate in work, they don't like it when the superiors criticize them harshly. They complain when the work is not smooth, and they are discouraged when they fail. These are all common things. This is being afraid of difficulties, afraid of磨炼 (molian, tempering), hoping to grow in a greenhouse, and it is also a manifestation of low awareness. Of course, we are not saying that a person should not be smooth in his work and should only have difficulties. If there are only difficulties and no favorable conditions, how can that work? However, more favorable conditions are created by people. When encountering difficulties, they should step forward, overcome them, defeat them, and turn them into favorable conditions. Cadres going down to work is to allow them to overcome difficulties and鍛煉 (duanlian, train) a cadre队伍 (duiwu, contingent, team, troops) that can withstand風浪 (fenglang, wind and waves, hardships). Young comrades must have such a thought, and they must always demand themselves in this way and鍛煉 (duanlian, train) themselves strictly. This can cultivate a firm, brave, tenacious, and indomitable character. In the past, this character was mainly created with the help of the enemy. In a class society, a new class, a generation of young people, wants to overthrow the ruling class. How can the ruling class let you overthrow them casually? They use various methods in ideology, politics, and law to persecute you and prevent you from翻身 (fanshen, to free oneself from oppression). Slave society, feudal society, and capitalist society are all like this. On the one hand, they want liberation, and on the other hand, they反解放 (fangjie fang, anti-liberation). When the two sides fight, if you have the ability, you overthrow him. If you don't have the ability, you become a slave, a beast of burden. In the past, in the days of seizing power, the revolutionary高潮 (gaochao, upsurge, high tide) was suppressed by the enemy several times. The revolution temporarily suffered a setback, and the difficulties increased. At this time, some people in the revolutionary队伍 (duiwu, contingent, team, troops) who could not withstand the test became discouraged, pessimistic, and disappointed, feeling that revolution was not fun and that it was better to live comfortably in a quiet greenhouse. They動搖 (dongyao, vacillated, wavered),退卻 (tuiqie, retreated), and wanted to just get by and spend their lives in the greenhouse. Many people even transformed and colluded with the enemy. Revolution cannot be馬虎 (mahu, careless, negligent). The days of being oppressed and exploited are not easy. Only those revolutionaries who have not entered the greenhouse, those revolutionaries who face difficulties and persist in fighting, they are with the masses, lead the masses, overthrow the reactionary rule, and make great contributions to the revolutionary cause, so that people will never forget them. Chairman Mao said in "On Coalition Government": "They crawled out from underground, wiped the blood stains from their bodies, buried the bodies of their comrades, and they continued to fight." No matter how powerful the reactionary rule is, it can never suppress the newborn forces. At the beginning of the revolutionary struggle, there are often more failures than victories. This is because they lack experience in struggle, their awareness is not high enough, and their tactics are not clever enough. If they fail, they will do it again. One failure after another, in the end, they will always打 (da, beat) down the ruling class. This is how the revolutionary class is鍛煉 (duanlian, trained, tempered) in the cruel struggle.

　　That's right, in the past it was a class society, and revolution and counter-revolution were incompatible like fire and water. The struggle was fierce, and there were many difficulties. Revolutionary youth could not grow up in a greenhouse, but only go to the class struggle to鍛煉 (duanlian, train, temper). Today is a peaceful environment. Can we enter the greenhouse and relax锻炼 (duanlian, training)? No. We are youth under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Party loves us and helps us to raise our awareness. We must consciously锻炼 (duanlian, train) ourselves and set ourselves the task of锻炼 (duanlian, training). "Fighting hard for three years" is what we proposed ourselves, because we need to develop the socialist economy at a high speed. The slower the construction speed, the longer the backwardness will拖 (tuo, drag on), the more pain there will be, and the greater the passivity will be. Of course, we cannot enter the greenhouse, but we should try every possible way to overcome difficulties and improve labor productivity, and advance at the highest speed. We should, as we have already done, constantly put forward more艰巨 (jianju, arduous) tasks for ourselves. After the task of fighting hard for three years is completed, and after production has developed to a considerable level, we will have to put forward even higher tasks. In the future, we will also conquer the universe, go to Mars, and go to other constellations. The great universe, the small universe, this constellation, that constellation, the future is so great! Life is so rich! We 打倒 (da dao, overthrow) imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and build a socialist new China. In the entire process of social and universal development, it is only an extremely small point. We say that human society is developing from low-level to high-level, and the big tasks are still behind. In a word, we must have a long-term vision, constantly锻炼 (duanlian, train) ourselves, constantly create, and constantly move forward.

　　Seriously study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, study the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, and study natural sciences.

　　Some people think: Isn't this kind of life very苦 (ku, bitter, hard), what's the taste? In the past, there was an exploiting class, so they suffered; now it is socialism, watching plays, eating, drinking, and being merry on the earth, isn't it very comfortable? Why is it necessary to engage in revolution and construction, to engage in war against nature, to go to the moon, to go to Mars? It's really asking for trouble. This idea is wrong. What is苦恼 (kunao, vexation)? What is happiness? Growing up in a greenhouse, eating when you're hungry, sleeping when you're tired, with no wind, frost, rain, or snow, raised fat and white, what happiness is there in that! Landlords and capitalists think that engaging in land, engaging in money, smoking opium, playing mahjong, and going to dance halls, living a corrupt and decadent life is happiness, but in fact, that is treating boredom as noble, which is very low-level. To put it bluntly, that is "the difference between man and beast is slight." We say that happiness is having achievements in serving the cause of human's lofty ideals, overcoming difficulties, solving contradictions, opening up new worlds, conquering the earth, conquering the universe, and creating new history. That is what we call happiness. If you think this is苦恼 (kunao, vexation), that is a strange philosophy. In the past, participating in the struggle was forced by the enemy. Today, creating history is conscious. Consciously creating history is the greatest joy in life. This question of what is happiness and what is苦恼 (kunao, vexation) is a big ideological issue and should be educated among young people. Every generation has great historical tasks. In this great historical task, everyone should have a share. Young people must have ambition, consciously锻炼 (duanlian, train) themselves, consciously participate in creating new history, and regard this task as the greatest happiness.

　　People who create new history understand the importance of learning the most. In a broad sense, participating in labor and the锻炼 (duanlian, training) of practical work is also a kind of learning, but it should not be thought that this is enough. We must also learn some basic knowledge, study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, study the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, and study various natural sciences.

　　There is such a view that reading too many books will make you a bookworm, and may even ruin you. Of course, some people become bookworms because they do less labor, participate less in practical struggle, see books but not people, see books but not things, and theory is divorced from practice. You can't simply say that the problem is in reading books. It's just like comrades who do practical work making the mistake of empiricism. You can't simply say that the problem is in doing practical work. There are also people who get worse the more they learn. For example, some people read a few books and then think they have great knowledge, become proud and arrogant, then it's bad. But this is a minority. For most of us, we still don't study enough. There is also such a situation, "Learn and then know your inadequacy." The more you learn, the more you know the infinity of the universe, the smallness of the individual, the greatness of the revolutionary cause, and the naivete and ridiculousness of pride and complacency. I am afraid that this is still a more common phenomenon. Using "will become a bookworm" and "the more you learn, the worse you become" as reasons for not studying seriously or even opposing learning is untenable.

　　There are also some comrades who have already taken up their jobs and believe that there is a contradiction between learning and work. Of course, it cannot be said that there is no contradiction, but it cannot be said that the contradiction has become so great that it is fundamentally impossible to learn. The logical conclusion of this view is that learning will hinder work. This is not seeing the side of learning well will make the work better. Perhaps when the situation is not complicated, it is okay to not study hard, but when the situation becomes complicated, it won't work and you will lose your way. Maybe when you don't carry the burden, don't decide important issues, and don't grasp policies, it's okay, but when you have to come up with ideas and make decisions, you will feel that it's not okay and you will摇摇摆摆 (yaoyao bai bai, wavering). We should see the help of learning to work from the positive side, and don't always say from the negative side that you can do a good job without learning. It seems that not learning is definitely a shortcoming, not an advantage. Furthermore, the contradiction between work and learning in terms of time arrangement can also be unified. You can't say that you have twenty-four hours a day, and besides working, sleeping, and eating, you don't have any time to learn at all. It is good to have a whole block of time to learn. Even if it is fragmented time, if you persist, it will add up over time, and you can finish reading the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, the Complete Works of Lenin, Capital, etc. in a few years. Since 1958, our cadres have been sent down to participate in labor, which proves that not only can the contradiction between learning and work be properly resolved, but also the contradiction between labor and work can be resolved. Many facts have proved that if you only study and don't practice, there will be problems; if you only bury your head in the work in front of you and don't study theory, there will also be problems.

　　Correctly recognize practice and theory.

　　The relationship between experts and all-rounders

　　"Is it true that once you have practice, you have theory, so there is no need to study anymore?" Some people often think this way. This involves the relationship between theory and practice. Everyone who has studied philosophy knows that matter is primary and spirit is secondary, and spirit is a reflection of matter. The relationship between theory and practice in general is precisely this relationship: practice is the basis of theory, and it is the standard for testing whether theory is correct; theory is a reflection of practice. As for how to reflect, there is a lot to say. It is not necessarily the case that if your department or your region has that practice, the theory must come out of your department or region. Marx wrote Capital by taking Britain as a typical example. At that time, Britain was the most developed in capitalist production, but it was Marx, a German, not a Briton, who scientifically reflected the laws of capitalist development. A class's own theory is also not destined to be reflected by someone in that class. The peasants have engaged in struggles for thousands of years, but they have not produced a set of theoretical doctrines. No peasant has come out to explain the historical position and tasks of the peasants, the relationship between the peasants and other classes, and how the peasants can be liberated, etc. The working class appeared in the sixteenth century, and it was not until the nineteenth century that Marx and Engels created the theory of the working class. This was also not created by the workers themselves. Lenin said in "What Is to Be Done?" that the working class cannot spontaneously create the scientific theory of the working class by its own strength alone. "The founders of modern scientific socialism, Marx and Engels, were also bourgeois intellectuals in terms of their social status." (See "Selected Works of Lenin," Two-Volume Edition, Volume 1, page 202) Of course, Marx and his comrades created the theory of the working class, and also否定 (fouding, negate, deny) themselves, transforming from bourgeois intellectuals into proletarian intellectuals. Why can't the working class explain themselves, but Marx, Engels, and Lenin explain it? This is because the theory that reflects practice is not a simple reflection, but a scientific reflection. Having practice is a foundation, just like having seeds before seedlings can grow; but having only the foundation, without other conditions, will not produce scientific reflection, just like having only seeds, but without soil, water, fertilizer, sunlight, and people's processing and cultivation, then good seedlings will not grow. It is worth noting that in history, workers were exploited and oppressed, and they were busy producing in order to eat and wear, and they couldn't even get enough to eat, so where would they have time for systematic thinking? Therefore, engaging in science and cultural arts has become the business of the exploiting class. Workers are oppressed and exploited, and they do not have the conditions to master science and culture. They can only be limited to a part of practice, cannot概括 (gaikuo, summarize) comprehensive practical experience, and it is difficult to inherit the cultural heritage of history, so scientific reflection does not come from them. To engage in production, you need to use pliers, hammers, knives, etc. To engage in science, you need to use concepts, categories, etc. It is a fact that those who are close to pliers and hammers every day do not have time to engage in concepts and categories. Only in socialist and communist societies will the time for everyone to be busy eating and dressing gradually decrease, and the time to engage in concepts and categories will gradually increase, and this situation will gradually change. What does this tell us? This tells us that the statement that theory is a reflection of practice is correct, but we must not therefore regard practice as theory, and we must not think that having practice means having theory. It should be on the premise of having practice as a basis, plus serious study, then practice can be reflected theoretically.

　　Is it enough to summarize the experience of the masses? It seems that some comrades are satisfied with this. Some people one-sidedly emphasize the production experience of peasants and ignore the role of agronomists, and one-sidedly emphasize the production experience of workers and ignore the role of engineers. Some people think that as long as you hold on-site meetings, summarize experience, and listen to some reports, you have learned theory. Of course, these are important and can learn some theory, but it must not be thought that this is enough and that you should not take another step forward. You should learn more of the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism. In this way, you can summarize experience better, right? Can you not better be able to raise experience to theory? The theory of Marxism-Leninism is certainly not a matter for a few scholars, but an ideological weapon for the broad masses of working people to strive for liberation. However, don't lightly lower its standards, thinking that you can completely master Marxism-Leninism without any effort.

　　Related to this is the denial of the role of experts. It is true that the more specialized, the more偏 (pian, biased). Especially bourgeois experts, lacking a correct world view and methodology, only understand one line, and once they鑽 (zuan, drill, penetrate) into it, they become arrogant, which is always more偏頗 (pianpo, biased). But despite this, we still have to admit that he has a specialty (of course, this refers to experts with real talent and learning), can reflect the reality of a certain aspect of the universe, and is useful for socialist construction. "Experts" are not a "dangerous road." The danger lies in the incorrect political direction and world view. People should not regard the false connection between "experts" and "danger" as a real connection, just like the older generations associated "the crow's cry" with "inauspiciousness." Some people also ask: "Isn't the promotion of all-rounders? Why do we still need experts?" Yes, we promote all-rounders, but this is not to say that we don't need experts. The universe is so big, and a person's head and hands are so small, can they understand everything and do everything? "Omnipotence" will lead to "inability." All-rounders are compared to the current situation. The universe is infinite, the individual is limited, and many individuals combined together, facing this infinite universe, must have a division of labor and experts in order to do systematic and in-depth research on a certain thing. However, this division of labor will have fewer and fewer traces of class society in the future. It is impossible to imagine that in a communist society, a person is both an astronomer, a microbiology expert, an atomic energy expert, a brain surgeon, a famous drama actor, and a juggling expert at the same time. On the basis of combining mental and physical labor, and on the basis of the comprehensive development of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness, "specialized learning" is still necessary and unavoidable. We should not鄙薄 (bibo, despise) experts or deny experts.

　　In summary, the negative views mentioned above that neglect learning are not in line with the direction of social development. Human development is becoming more and more cultured, and the level of science and theory is also getting higher and higher. Anyone who stops will become more and more passive. Think about it, as society moves forward, if we only understand so little about Marxism-Leninism, we still don't understand natural science very well, and our Chinese, mathematics, etc. are very poor, then it is definitely not good. Ten or twenty years later, you still can't say: "My origin is good, I participated in the revolutionary work early, and it is an honor for me to be backward."

　　We should make up our minds to learn. "A young idler, an old beggar" is a deeply felt sentence. "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold" is also a meaningful sentence. Not to mention before liberation, just say after liberation, ten years have passed in the blink of an eye. How have you learned? How have you improved? Isn't it worth thinking about? It seems that it is better to make a study plan and be strict with yourself. For example, stipulate that you will finish reading the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and the Complete Works of Lenin in three years, and you will finish reading Marx's "Capital" and other important works by Marx and Engels in five years, and you will read it three times in ten years. "Reviewing the old to know the new," reading it several times can always give you心得 (xinde, what one has learned from work, study, etc.) and experience. To put it more broadly, you can also stipulate to learn some mathematics, Chinese, history, natural science, etc. You can also learn some cultural arts and learn some foreign languages. What's wrong with this? It's just that you play less simple games like poker during your rest time, which will never do any harm. It seems that you still have to have determination. From simple to complex, from shallow to deep, from less to more, persevere, and you can learn something over time. I hope that young comrades will aspire to greatness, exert great effort, consciously锻炼 (duanlian, train) themselves, consciously study hard, and devote their share of strength, light, and heat to the great historical task.

　　立大志，鼓大劲，自觉地加强锻炼和努力学习
　　中共江苏省委书记　刘顺元
    历史的发展总是后来居上。青年一代将来要比老年一代强，现在的人比过去的人干的好，将来的人比现在的人会干得更好。人是经过几种社会形态变化过来的。大家读过社会发展史，都知道人类社会是由原始共产主义社会到奴隶社会，由奴隶社会到封建社会，由封建社会到资本主义社会，由资本主义社会到社会主义社会，再到共产主义社会。每一个新的社会形态与过去相比，不论是在物质方面还是在精神方面，都是越来越好。这些都说明：后来一定居上。这是主要的一面，谁不这样认识，就不符合社会发展的规律，就会犯错误。
    要后来居上，首先就要向过去的人学习，向成年人和老年人学习
    社会发展总的趋势是后来居上，但是对于具体的人来说，青年人就不一定都比老年人强，不一定都能居上。要居上，首先要向过去的人学习，向成年人和老年人学习。我们提倡厚今薄古，相信现在的东西比过去好，这并不是否定过去，把成年人和老年人都丢掉了。不但不能丢，还要向他们学习。不把他们的好东西学过来，不在他们已经达到的基础上求发展，那就会浪费劳力，就会走弯路，就不可能居上。很多事情都是这样，比如现在有很多大楼，建筑得很好，但是历史上，并不是老早就有大楼的，大楼之前是平房，最早的时候是构木为巢。交通也是这样，现在有轮船、电车、火车、飞机，过去是独轮车，木帆船。这都是说，任何事物的发展，总是由简单到复杂，由低级到高级发展起来的，没有简单就没有复杂，没有低级就没有高级，不接受前人的创造，不在前人已有创造的基础上继续发展，就很难居上。列宁在1920年10月，在苏联共青团第三次全国代表大会上，有过一篇演说，他说，青年的任务，“就是要学习”。（列宁全集三十一卷二百五十页）青年一代要好好地学习。不要以为历史发展既然是后来居上，每个青年人就自然都是刮刮叫，根本不必向过去学习，也不必向成年和老年学习了。
    大家不要把学习“过去”笼统地理解成“厚古薄今”。这样理解问题是有害的。中国有过国粹主义、复古主义，那些老先生们，讲起来就是尧、舜、文武、周公、孔子，说他们都是圣人，只有他们最行，说今天不如过去，世道越来越坏。他们根本看不起青年人，说青年人是“嘴上无毛，办事不牢”。这是“厚古薄今”。这在基本方面就错了。统治阶级也是这样，他们怕人家革命，总想自己的统治永世不移，所以他们总说年青人不行，想尽各种方法来打击青年人的积极性。我们是不断革命论者，要推动历史前进，我们认为青年人行，认为后来居上。去年“五四”那一天，人民日报有篇社论叫“又红又专，后来居上”，讲了很多历史上干过大事的青年人，讲到唐朝李世民十八岁当总司令，宋朝岳飞二十岁建岳家军，这是鼓舞青年的干劲，也是用历史发展的事实证明后来居上的道理。对于历史发展的总趋势，对于这个总趋势下面的一代一代的新人，我们应当这样看，应当确信后来居上。但是，理解这个问题也不要完全偏到一边去，把“古”全部丢掉。例如有些青年人认为过去的东西一文不值了，不必向成年和老年人学习了，老年人都是“朽木不可雕”了，那是完全错误的。看来，搞清楚这个问题，辩证地理解青年和成年、老年的关系，对我们教育青年，对于青年的成长，都是很重要的。否则，很容易把青年人弄得自高自大，像喝醉了酒一样，整天飘飘然，那就是害人不浅的。
　　必须在各种矛盾和斗争中成长，必须经受严格的锻炼
    当一个人变得整天飘飘然以后，他就不会注意学习和锻炼。事实上，任何人必须在各种矛盾和斗争中成长，必须经受锻炼，特别是青年人。锻炼越严格，智力（往往也包括体力）一般是越发展。这好有一比：花草放在温室里，下雨打不着，大风吹不着，严寒冻不着，酷热热不着，长得青枝绿叶，娇柔多姿；可是一到室外，遇上狂风暴雨，就枯萎了。野草却不同，它整天蹲在外面，风吹雨打，冷冷热热，弄惯了，什么都不怕。冬天实在太冷了，它暂时到泥里躲一躲，春天又冒出来，还是活着，就像中国古诗上说的那样：“野火烧不尽，春风吹又生”。历史上有成就的人，都是经过严格锻炼，吃过很大苦头的。过去如此，将来也如此；一个人如此，一个革命阶级也如此；中国革命如此，所有的社会主义国家的革命也如此。拿中国共产党和人民解放军的情况来说，最初人数不多，只有大刀、土枪、矛子，连步枪也没有，到后来只有小米加步枪，敌人却是日本帝国主义，美帝国主义，蒋介石反动派，又狡猾，又有洋枪洋炮。我们的困难多得很，可是困难能锻炼人，逼着人想办法。没有枪就搞敌人的枪，没有钱就发动群众边打仗边搞生产，办法越搞越多，队伍越弄越大，力量越斗越强，结果不到三十年就把这些反动派一齐搞垮了，而我们却变成了不可战胜的巨人。人为万物之灵，有无穷潜力，经得起七灾八难，越磨炼本领越大。我们都知道孙悟空是个不简单的角色，在唐僧取经的路上，他战胜了很多妖魔鬼怪，他曾经大闹天宫，被太上老君抓去放在八卦炉里炼了七七四十九天，以为他要化为脓血，结果就只是眼睛有点怕烟，但是炼出了一个“火眼金睛”，可以识破妖魔鬼怪的千变万化。西游记里的孙悟空是锻炼出来的，不是温室里长出来的，这是一个很好的典型。
    值得注意的是，当人们还不大自觉的时候，往往希望在温室里生长。希望到处受拥护，受欢呼，受鼓掌。拿到红旗，拿到奖状，心里就高兴得很。在家里，总是喜欢母亲，不大喜欢父亲。古话说“严父慈母”，父亲一般总要比母亲严格一些，就不大喜欢。参加工作了，上级批评严一点，又不喜欢。工作不顺利就埋怨，失败了就灰心丧气。这些，都是常见的事情。这就是害怕困难，害怕磨炼，希望在温室里生长，也是觉悟不高的表现。当然，我们不是说，一个人在工作中不应该顺利，只应该有困难。如果都是困难而没有有利条件，那怎能行呢。不过，更多的有利条件是靠人去创造的，在遇到困难的时候，应该挺身而出，克服它，战胜它，把它化为有利条件。干部下放劳动，就是为了让他们去克服困难，锻炼出一支经得起风浪的干部队伍。青年同志要有这样一个思想，要时刻这样要求自己，严格锻炼自己，这才能培养出坚定、勇敢、顽强、不屈不挠的性格。过去，这种性格主要是敌人帮忙造成的。在阶级社会里，新生的阶级，青年的一代，要推翻统治阶级，统治阶级那能随便让你推翻，他们在思想上、政治上、法律上用种种办法来迫害你，不让你翻身。奴隶社会、封建社会、资本主义社会都如此。一边要解放，一边反解放，一来一往，斗争起来，有本领就推翻他，没有本领就做奴隶，做牛马。过去，在夺取政权的日子里，革命高潮曾几次被敌人压下去，革命暂时失利了，困难加重了，这时，革命队伍中，有些经不起考验的人，就灰心丧气，悲观失望起来，觉得革命不是好玩的，不如住在安静的温室里舒服，他们动摇了，退却了，想马马虎虎地算了，在温室里度过自己的一生，不少人甚至转化到与敌人同流合污。革命是不能马虎的，受压迫受剥削的日子是不好过的，只有那些没有走进温室的革命者，那些面对困难、坚持战斗的革命者，他们和群众在一起，带领了群众，推翻了反动统治，为革命事业做出了伟大贡献，才使人们永远念念不忘。毛主席在“论联合政府”中说到：“他们从地下爬起来，揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了。”反动统治不管有多么厉害，总是压不倒新生力量的，在革命斗争开始的时候，往往是失败的时候多，胜利的时候少，这是因为开始缺乏斗争经验，觉悟不够高，战术还不够巧妙。失败了再干，一次又一次的失败，最后总归是要把统治阶级打下去的，革命的阶级就是这样从残酷的斗争中锻炼出来的。
    不错，过去是阶级社会，革命和反革命水火不容，斗争激烈，困难很多，革命青年不可能在温室里成长，只有到阶级斗争中去锻炼。今天是和平环境，我们可不可以走进温室，放松锻炼呢？不能。我们是在共产党领导下的青年，党爱护我们，帮助我们提高觉悟，我们就要自觉地来锻炼自己，自己给自己提出锻炼的任务。“苦战三年”是我们自己提出来的，因为我们需要高速度的发展社会主义经济。建设速度越慢，落后情况就拖得越长，痛苦就越多，被动性就越大。我们当然不能走进温室，而是应该千方百计，克服困难，提高劳动生产率，用最高速度向前跃进。我们应该像已经做过的那样，不断地为自己提出更艰巨的任务。在苦战三年的任务完成以后，在生产发展到相当水平以后，也还要提出更高的任务。往后，我们还要征服宇宙，到火星上去，到其他星座上去。大宇宙，小宇宙，这个星座，那个星座，前程是多么远大啊！生活又是多么丰富啊！我们打倒帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，建设社会主义的新中国，在整个社会和宇宙发展的过程中，只是极其微小的一点点。我们说，人类社会是由低级向高级发展的，大任务还在后边呢。一句话，我们要眼光远大，不断地锻炼自己，不断地创造，不断地前进。
    认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，学习马列主义的经典著作，学习自然科学
    有人想：这样人生不是苦得很，有什么味道？过去有剥削阶级，所以会受苦；现在是社会主义，在地球上看看戏，吃吃喝喝，不是舒服得很吗？何必要搞什么革命和建设，搞什么向自然界开战，上月球，上火星呢？真是自找苦恼。这种想法是不对的。什么叫苦恼？什么叫快乐？在温室里成长，吃了睡，睡了吃，没有风霜雨雪，养得胖胖的，这有什么快乐！地主、资本家以为搞土地、搞金钱、抽鸦片、打麻将、跑跳舞厅，过腐化糜烂生活是快乐，其实那是把无聊当高尚，是很低级的，说穿了，那就是“人之异于禽兽者几希”。我们说，快乐是在服务于人类崇高理想的事业上有成就，克服了困难，解决了矛盾，打开了新天地，征服了地球，征服了宇宙，创造了新的历史，这才叫做快乐。如果认为这是苦恼，那才是奇怪的哲学。过去参加斗争是被敌人压迫出来的，今天，创造历史是自觉的。自觉地创造历史，才是人生最大的乐趣。这个什么是快乐、什么是苦恼的问题，是一个很大的思想问题，应该在青年中进行教育。每一代人都有伟大的历史任务。在这个伟大的历史任务中，每一个人都应该有一分。青年要有志气，要自觉地锻炼自己，自觉地参加创造新的历史，并把这个任务看作是最大的快乐。
    创造新历史的人，最懂得学习的重要。从广义方面来讲，参加劳动和实际工作的锻炼，也是一种学习，但是不能以为这样就够了，还要学习一些基本知识，学习毛泽东同志的著作，学习马克思列宁主义的经典著作，学习各种自然科学。
    有那么一种看法，认为多读了书，会成为书呆子，甚至会把人读坏的。当然，是有人成为书呆子，那是因为他劳动少，参加实际斗争少，见书不见人，见书不见物，理论脱离了实际，不能单纯地说毛病是出在读书上，这正好像做实际工作的同志，如果犯了经验主义的错误。不能单纯地说毛病是出在做实际工作上一样。越学越坏的人，也是有的。例如有些人看了几本书以后，就自以为有了很大的学问，骄傲起来了，狂妄自大了，那就坏了。但是这是少数，对我们大多数人来讲，还是学习得很不够。也有这样一种情况，“学而后知不足”，越学越知道宇宙的无限，个人的渺小，革命事业的伟大，骄傲自满的幼稚可笑，这恐怕还是更大量的现象。用“会成为书呆子”和“越学越坏”来作为不认真学习甚至反对学习的理由，是站不住脚的。
    还有一些已经走上了工作岗位的同志，认为学习和工作有矛盾。当然不能说没有矛盾，但是，也不能说矛盾已经大到根本不能学习。这样的看法，逻辑的结论就是：学习会妨碍工作。这就是没有看到学习好会使工作做得更好的一面了。也许在情况不复杂的时候，不努力学习工作还可以过得去，到了情况复杂的时候，那就不行了，迷失方向了。也许不担担子，既不决定重大问题也不掌握政策的时候，还可以过得去，到了要出主意、做决定的时候，就体会到不行了，摇摇摆摆了。应当从积极方面看到学习对工作的帮助，不要老是从消极方面来说不学习也可以做好工作。现在看来，不学习，这肯定是一个缺点，而不是什么优点。再说工作和学习在时间安排上的矛盾，那也是可以统一起来的。不能说你一天二十四小时，除了工作、睡觉、吃饭之外，根本没有一点时间可以学习。有整块的时间来学习固然好，就是零碎的时间，如果持之以恒，也会积少成多，几年下来就可以读完毛泽东选集、列宁全集、资本论等等。1958年以来，我们下放干部参加劳动，证明了不仅学习与工作的矛盾可以适当解决，就是劳动与工作的矛盾，也是可以解决的。许多事实证明了，光学习不实践，会出乱子；光埋头做眼前一点工作，不学习理论，也会出乱子。
    正确认识实践和理论
    专家和多面手的关系
    “是不是有了实践就有了理论，因此不必再要有什么学习了呢？”有人常常这样想。这就涉及到理论和实践的关系问题。大家学过哲学，都知道，物质第一性，精神第二性，精神是物质的反映。理论和实践的关系总的说来，正是这种关系：实践是理论的基础，是检验理论正确与否的标准，理论是实践的反映。至于怎样反映，就大有文章。并不一定你那个部门，你那个地区有那个实践，理论就一定出在你那个部门或地区。马克思写资本论就是拿英国作典型的。当时资本主义生产最发达的是英国，但是科学地反映资本主义发展规律的是马克思，他是德国人，而不是英国人。一个阶级自己的理论，也不注定非是他那个阶级里的人来反映不可。农民搞了几千年的斗争，就并没有产生出一套理论学说，没有一个农民出来说明农民的历史地位、任务、农民和其他阶级的关系，以及农民怎样获得解放，等等。工人阶级出现于十六世纪，到了十九世纪，马克思、恩格斯才创立了工人阶级的理论。这也不是工人本身创立起来的。列宁在“做什么”一书中说过，工人阶级只靠自己的力量并不能自发地创造出工人阶级的科学理论。“现代科学社会主义底创始者马克思和恩格斯两人，按其社会地位来讲，也是资产阶级的知识分子。”（见“列宁文选”两卷集第一卷二百零二页）当然，马克思他们创造了工人阶级的理论，也否定了自己，由资产阶级知识分子变成了无产阶级的知识分子。为什么工人阶级不能说明自己，而是马克思、恩格斯、列宁来说明呢？这就因为理论反映实践并不是简单的反映，而是科学的反映。有了实践，这是个基础，好比有了种子才会长出苗来；但是光有基础，没有其他条件，也不会出现科学的反映，这好比光有种子，而没有土壤、水分、肥料、阳光以及人们加工培植等等，那也不会长出好苗来。值得注意的是，历史上工人受剥削受压迫，他们忙生产是为了吃穿，甚至饭都吃不上，那里来时间作系统的思考？因此搞科学，搞文化艺术都成了剥削阶级的事情。工人受压迫受剥削，没有条件掌握科学文化，他们只能局限在一部分的实践中，不能概括全面的实践经验，也难以继承历史上的文化遗产，所以科学的反映不是出在他们身上。搞生产要用钳子、鎯头、刀具等等，搞科学要用概念、范畴等等，天天接近钳子、鎯头，就不大来得及搞概念、搞范畴，这是事实。只有到了社会主义共产主义社会，大家忙吃忙穿的时间逐渐减少了，搞概念、范畴的时间才会逐渐增多，这种情况才会逐渐改变。这告诉我们什么呢？这告诉我们：理论是实践的反映这句话，一点也不错，但是决不能因此把实践看作就是理论，不能以为有了实践就是有了理论。应当是在有了实践这个基础的前提下，加上认真的学习，实践才能得到理论上的反映。
    是不是把群众的经验总结总结就行了呢？看来，有些同志是满足于这一点的。有些人片面地强调农民的生产经验，忽视农学家的作用，片面地强调工人的生产经验，忽视工程师的作用。有些人以为只要开开现场会议，总结一下经验，听一些报告，就是学习了理论了。当然，这些都是重要的，是能够学到些理论的，但是，决不能以为这样就够了，不要再前进一步了。应当更多地学一点马克思列宁主义的基本理论。这样，你去总结经验，不是可以总结得更好吗？不是可以更能够把经验上升到理论吗？马克思列宁主义的理论，肯定不是少数学者的事情，而是广大劳动群众争取解放的思想武器。但是，也不要轻率地降低了它的标准，以为不费吹灰之力就可以完全掌握马克思列宁主义。
    与此相关的是否认专家的作用。越专越偏，这是不错的。特别是资产阶级专家，缺乏正确的世界观和方法论，只懂得某一行，钻进去以后就目空一切，那总是比较偏颇的。但是尽管如此，我们还是要承认他有一门专长（当然，这里指的是有真才实学的专家），能够反映宇宙的某一方面的实际，对社会主义建设事业是有作用的。“专家”并不是什么“危险的道路”。危险是在政治方向、世界观方面的不端正。人们不要把“专家”和“危险”这种虚假的联系当作真实的联系，就像老几代人“把乌鸦叫”和“不吉利”联系在一起那样。还有人问道：“不是提倡多面手吗？还要专家干什么？”是的，我们提倡多面手，但是这并不是不要专家。宇宙这样大，一个人的脑袋和双手是这样小，能够什么都懂，什么都能吗？“万能”就会“不能”。多面手是同现在的情况比较而言的。宇宙无限，个人有限，许多个人结合在一起，对着这个无限的宇宙，就得有分工，有专家，以便对某个事物做系统的深刻的研究。不过，这种分工，在往后，越来越没有阶级社会的遗迹了。不可能设想，在共产主义社会里某一个人又是天文学家，又是微生物专家，又是原子能专家，又是脑外科专家，还是著名的戏剧演员，同时又是耍杂技的能手。在脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的基础上，在德智体全面发展的基础上，“学有专攻”还是必要的，也是不可避免的。我们不应当鄙薄专家，否定专家。
    总起来说，上面所说的那些忽视学习的消极看法，都是不符合社会发展方向的。人类的发展是越来越有文化，科学、理论的水平也是越来越高，谁要是停止下来，一定会越来越被动。试想想看，社会向前发展，如果我们对马克思列宁主义还只是懂得那么一点点，自然科学还是不大懂，语文、数学都很差，那肯定是不行的。十年、二十年以后，你总不能还是说：“我成分好，参加革命工作早，我落后也是光荣的。”
    应当下定决心来学习了。“少壮不努力，老大徒伤悲”，这是体会很深的一句话。“一寸光阴一寸金”，这也是意味深长的一句话。不说解放以前，就说解放以后，一转眼十年过去了，你学习得怎样？长进得怎样？不是很值得想想吗？看来，还是订个学习的规划为好，自己紧一紧自己。比如自己规定三年读完毛泽东选集、列宁全集，五年看完马克思的“资本论”和马克思、恩格斯的其他重要著作，十年读它三遍。“温故而知新”，多看几遍，总可以有心得，有体会。再讲得宽一点，还可以规定学点数学、语文、历史、自然科学等等，也可以学一点文化艺术，学一些外文。这有什么不好呢？无非在休息时间里少打一点扑克之类的简单玩意儿，总不会有什么害处。看来，还是要有决心。由简单到复杂，由浅入深，由少到多，持之以恒，时间长了就可以学到一点东西。希望青年同志们立大志，鼓大劲，自觉地锻炼自己，自觉地努力学习，在伟大的历史任务中尽自己的一分力，发自己的一分光和热。
