　　Japanese Political Situation in the Election Struggle
　　Lan Hai
　　In the heat of the election struggle, Japan's local elections will be held from April 23rd to the end of the month. This year's local elections in Japan will elect governors of twenty prefectures, mayors of cities, towns, and villages, and members of prefectural, city, town, and village assemblies. After these local elections, known as the "prelude" to the House of Councillors election, the election struggle will be entirely focused on the House of Councillors election from May until early June.

　　The local election campaign began at the end of March. The increasingly fierce election struggle has become a prominent event in the current Japanese political situation. The rise and fall of the forces represented by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), representing Japan's conservative and reactionary forces, and the Socialist Party and Communist Party, representing the democratic and progressive forces, in these two elections is of great significance to the future development of the political situation.

　　The Struggle Between Two Roads

　　Compared with the previous elections three or four years ago, the domestic political situation in Japan has undergone major changes in this year's local and House of Councillors elections. During this period, especially since Nobusuke Kishi came to power, the Japanese government has constantly plotted various conspiracies, attempting to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism under the guidance of the United States. As a result, the contradictions between the Japanese people and the reactionary forces led by Nobusuke Kishi have become increasingly acute. The Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, and democracy has continued to rise. At the end of last year, the Japanese people shattered Nobusuke Kishi's conspiracy to restore a military police state by revising the Police Duties Execution Law through an unprecedented struggle. Since the beginning of this year, the Japanese people have continued their efforts, launching a climax of the struggle against revising and striving to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　In March of this year, when the local election campaign intensified, three million workers launched a large-scale spring struggle; people from all walks of life in Japan launched a "Month of Action to Stop the Revision of the Security Treaty" from the 15th; on the 28th, 134 political parties and people's organizations in Japan formed the "National Conference to Stop the Revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty." On the other hand, in the local elections, the Nobusuke Kishi group, loyal to the interests of Japanese and American monopoly capital, ignored the opposition of the Japanese people and still refused to abandon the conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Following the Kishi Nobusuke group's announcement of the "Outline for Revising the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" on April 8th, Japan and the United States resumed negotiations to revise the treaty on April 13th and decided to continue the negotiations on April 23rd.

　　Precisely because of this, in this "election battle," the struggle between reactionary and progressive, war and peace forces in Japan will inevitably become increasingly acute. At present, this struggle will determine: whether to stop the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," get rid of the Japan-U.S. military alliance, and implement a neutral policy to achieve Japan's peace, independence, and guarantee its security, or to forcibly revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," choose the path of war and militarist aggression, and hinder the realization of peace and independence. The Japanese people are fighting to achieve the former goal.

　　Nobusuke Kishi Group's Conspiracy

　　This local election and House of Councillors election is a critical juncture for the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Last year, under the blows of the Japanese people's powerful struggle against the revision of the Police Duties Execution Law, the Nobusuke Kishi group fell into a very embarrassing situation. The Liberal Democratic Party experienced shaking and confusion. Especially today, with the continuous strengthening of unity among democratic and progressive forces in various regions, the conservative and reactionary forces of the Liberal Democratic Party are being weakened in their traditional strongholds. The Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party are making every effort to reverse their decline through this election.

　　Since the success or failure of the local elections will directly affect the House of Councillors election, the Nobusuke Kishi group attaches great importance to the local elections. It has adopted a desperate posture in the four regions of Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Hokkaido. In Sapporo, Hokkaido, and other places, the battle between democratic forces and conservative reactionary forces is also exceptionally fierce. The election struggles in these places have long appeared as tense "decisive battle" situations, as if the polling day had arrived.

　　As in previous elections, this time Japan's monopoly capital groups are also generously funding the Liberal Democratic Party's election activities. On April 15th, the "Economic Reconstruction Roundtable Conference," which specializes in political donations from Japan's financial and business circles, met in Tokyo. The meeting decided that Japan's monopoly capital groups would openly allocate around 350 million yen of election funds for this local election and the House of Councillors election. The vast majority of this money is donated to the Liberal Democratic Party. Japanese monopoly capital provides a lot of money to the Nobusuke Kishi group, both in secret assistance and open donations. For example, Tokutaro Azuma, the Liberal Democratic Party's candidate for Governor of Tokyo, had already spent as much as 120 million yen on bribery and other illegal election activities before the government officially announced the start of the election.

  　The Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are making every effort to use their favorable position as the ruling party, taking out political funds donated by capitalists to buy votes, lavishly entertain guests, and engage in other bribery activities. In addition, this year they are also using the opportunity of the Crown Prince's marriage to hold "celebration" activities across the country from April 10th at "public expense," conducting deceptive propaganda among voters that is conducive to maintaining their reactionary rule.

　　In this election struggle, the issue of Sino-Japanese relations has become a focus of intense struggle between democratic and progressive forces and conservative and reactionary forces. Not long ago, the Socialist Party visited China, held talks with Chinese leaders, and signed the Asanuma-Zhang Xiruo Joint Statement, powerfully exposing the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy of hostility towards China and greatly encouraging the Japanese people's struggle for friendly relations between Japan and China. The Nobusuke Kishi group is doing its utmost to belittle the great achievements of the Socialist Party's visit to China, launching a vicious propaganda offensive against the Socialist Party, attempting to undermine the Socialist Party's prestige in the election. On the other hand, the Liberal Democratic Party is also attempting to divide the democratic forces and deceive the people with a "democratic" signboard by jointly nominating candidates with the Socialist Party in some prefectures. However, these conspiracies orchestrated by the Liberal Democratic Party in the election are being exposed and countered by the democratic forces.

　　Unity of Democratic Forces

　　In this year's election, Japan's democratic and progressive forces are conducting intense campaign activities and constantly strengthening their unity in order to defeat the conservative and reactionary forces.

　　The Socialist Party, Japan's largest opposition party, has put forward campaign slogans such as "Oppose diplomacy that follows the United States," "Oppose hostility towards China," "Restore Japan-China diplomatic relations," "Abolish the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty," "Eliminate decadent politics," and "Establish local autonomy" to confront the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Leading cadres of the Socialist Party have conducted campaign speeches in various regions. On April 6th, Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Socialist Party, expressed the Socialist Party's confidence in winning victories in some regions in Osaka. He said that as long as the Liberal Democratic Party loses one place, the Nobusuke Kishi regime will collapse accordingly.

　　In the local elections, the Japanese Communist Party, in addition to putting forward its own candidates, is also working hard to unite the democratic forces in Tokyo and many other prefectures to jointly conduct the election struggle. The Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Secretariat issued a message calling on patriotic and democratic forces to strengthen their joint struggle in the local elections and the House of Councillors election. In Osaka, Fukuoka, Niigata, Wakayama, and Kanagawa prefectures, local organizations of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party have already decided to conduct joint struggles in the election campaign. This kind of joint struggle is also being strengthened within the various districts of Tokyo. In some places, local organizations of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party have clearly reached policy agreements and put forward common election platforms.

　　A noteworthy phenomenon in this election struggle is the increasing enthusiasm of trade unions for the election struggle. This also plays a major role in strengthening the unity of democratic and progressive forces. For example, members of trade unions in state-owned railways, printing industry, and metal industry are vigorously supporting the candidates put forward by the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Trade union cadres who only supported the Socialist Party in the past are also supporting the Communist Party this time. Moreover, within many trade unions, there is a tendency to guarantee trade union work by supporting freedom of political parties and freedom of political activity.

　　In this election struggle, the joint struggle of the democratic forces will have a profound impact on the development of the Japanese political situation. The continuous strengthening of Japan's democratic and progressive forces and their unity has made some people within the Liberal Democratic Party worried that the ruling party may suffer a setback in the election. Hayato Ikeda, one of the leaders of the anti-mainstream faction of the Liberal Democratic Party, said: "If the ruling party fails in the gubernatorial elections in Tokyo, Osaka, Hokkaido, and Fukuoka, it will mean a series of setbacks for the revision of the Security Treaty."

　　News has revealed that at that time, the anti-mainstream faction will investigate Nobusuke Kishi's responsibility and force him to resign.

    竞选斗争中的日本政局
    蓝海
    在竞选斗争的热潮中，日本的地方选举从4月23日起到月底止分别举行投票。今年日本的地方选举，将选举二十个都道府县的知事，市、町、村长和都道府县与市町村议会的议员。在这次被称为参议院选举“前哨战”的地方选举过后，从5月开始直到6月初止，竞选斗争就将完全集中在参议院的选举上面。
    地方选举的竞选运动是从3月底开始的，目前，愈演愈剧的竞选斗争，已成了当前日本政局的一个突出事件。以自由民主党为代表的日本保守反动势力和以社会党、共产党为代表的民主进步势力，在这两次选举中的力量消长，对今后政局的发展具有重要意义。
    两条道路的斗争
    今年日本的地方选举和参议院选举，同三、四年前的上一届选举比起来，国内政治形势已发生了重大的变化。在这段时期里，特别是岸信介上台以来，日本政府不断策划各种阴谋，企图在仰承美国的鼻息下，加紧复活日本军国主义。因此，日本人民同以岸信介为首的反动势力的矛盾日趋尖锐化。日本人民争取和平、独立、民主的斗争不断高涨。去年年底日本人民以史无前例的斗争，粉碎了岸信介企图借修改“警职法”恢复军事警察国家的阴谋。今年年初以来，日本人民再接再厉，掀起了一个反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”斗争的高潮。
    今年3月，在地方选举竞选斗争激化的时候，三百万工人开展了声势浩大的春季斗争；日本各界人民从15日起发动了一个“阻止修改安全条约行动月”；28日日本的一百三十四个政党和人民团体组成了“阻止修改日美安全条约国民会议”。另一方面，在地方选举中，忠于日美垄断资本利益的岸信介集团，不顾日本人民的反对，仍然不肯放弃修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋。继4月8日岸信介集团发表“修改日美安全条约纲要”之后，4月13日日美双方恢复了修改这项条约的谈判，并决定在4月23日继续举行谈判。
    正是因为这样，在这次“选举战”中，日本国内的反动与进步、战争与和平两种力量的斗争必将日趋尖锐化。目前，这一斗争将决定：是阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”，摆脱日美军事同盟，实行中立政策，以取得日本的和平、独立和保障日本的安全呢，还是强行修改日美“安全条约”，选择战争和军国主义侵略的道路，阻碍和平、独立的实现。日本人民正在为实现前一目标而奋斗。
    岸信介集团的阴谋
    这次地方选举和参议院选举，对于岸信介政府及执政的自由民主党来说，是一个重大关头。去年在日本人民反对修改“警职法”强大斗争的打击下，岸信介集团陷于十分狼狈的境地。自由民主党发生了动摇和混乱。特别是在各地的民主进步力量不断加强团结统一的今天，自由民主党的保守反动势力在各地的传统地盘，正被削弱。岸信介政府和自由民主党竭力企图通过这次选举，挽回自己的颓势。
    由于地方选举的成败，将直接影响参议院的选举，因此，岸信介集团对地方选举十分重视。它在东京都、大阪、福冈、北海道的四个地区，采取了拚死挣扎的架式。在北海道的扎幌等地，民主势力同保守反动势力的搏斗也异常激烈。这些地方的竞选斗争，早就出现了像投票日来临那样紧张的“决战”局面。
    和历次的选举一样，这次日本的垄断资本集团也大掏腰包，资助自由民主党的竞选活动。4月15日，日本金融财政界专门负责政治捐款的“经济再建恳谈会”在东京开会。这次会议决定，日本垄断资本集团要公开对这次地方选举和参议院选举拨出三亿五千万日元左右的选举资金。这笔钱的绝大部分是捐给自由民主党的。日本垄断资本对岸信介集团平时暗中接济和这次公开捐助的钱，是很多的。例如，仅自由民主党的东京都知事候选人东龙太郎，在政府正式宣布竞选开始以前，用于贿买及其它违法活动的选举费就已经多达一亿二千万日元。
  　岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党正竭力利用执政的有利地位，拿出资本家捐的政治资金进行收买选票、大肆请客和其它贿选活动。此外，它们今年还利用皇太子结婚的机会，以“公费”，从4月10日起在全国各地举行“庆祝”活动，向选民进行有利于维持它们反动统治的欺骗性宣传。
    在这次竞选斗争中，中日关系问题成了民主进步力量同保守反动力量进行激烈斗争的一个焦点。不久前，社会党访问中国，和中国领导人举行会谈，并签订了浅沼—张奚若共同声明，有力地揭穿了岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，大大鼓舞了日本人民争取日中友好关系的斗争。岸信介集团极力贬低社会党访问中国的巨大成果，向社会党发动一次恶毒的宣传攻势，企图在选举中破坏社会党的威信。另一方面，自由民主党又在一些县份里，以同社会党共同提候选人的办法，企图达到分化民主力量和以“民主”招牌蒙骗人民的目的。但自由民主党在选举中策动的这些阴谋，正在遭到民主力量的揭发和反击。
    民主力量的团结
    在今年的选举中，日本的民主进步力量为了击败保守反动势力，正在进行紧张的竞选活动，并且不断地加强了团结。
    日本最大的在野党社会党，提出“反对追随美国的外交”、“反对敌视中国”、“恢复日中邦交”、“废除日美安全条约”、“清除废败政治”、“建立地方自治”等竞选口号，同执政的自由民主党对抗。社会党的领导干部在各地进行了竞选演说。4月6日，社会党委员长铃木茂三郎在大阪表示了社会党在一些地区获得胜利的信心。他说，自由民主党只要丢掉一个地方，岸信介政权就相应地崩溃一部分。
    日本共产党在地方选举中，除提出自己的候选人外，还努力团结东京都及不少县的民主力量，共同进行竞选斗争。日本共产党中央委员会干部会发表文告，号召爱国民主力量在地方选举和参议院选举中加强联合斗争。在大阪、福冈、新潟、和歌山、神奈川五个府县，共产党和社会党的地方组织已经决定在竞选运动中进行联合斗争。东京都的各地区内，这种联合斗争也在加强。有些地方，共产党和社会党的地方组织明确地达成了政策上的协议，提出了共同的选举纲领。
    这次竞选斗争中一个值得注意的现象，是工会对于竞选斗争的积极性不断地在提高。这对加强民主进步力量的团结也有很大的作用。例如，国营铁道、印刷业、金属工业等工会的会员，大力支持社会党和共产党提出的候选人。过去只支持社会党的工会干部，这次也一样支持共产党。而且在许多工会内，出现了以支持政党的自由和政治活动的自由来保障工会工作的倾向。
    在这次竞选斗争中，民主力量的联合斗争将对日本政治局势的发展产生深远的影响。日本民主进步力量及其团结的不断增强，已使自由民主党内部一些人担心执政党可能在选举中遭到挫败。自由民主党反主流派首脑之一的池田勇人曾说：“如果执政党在东京、大阪、北海道和福冈的知事选举中失败，就意味着修改安全条约遭到一系列挫折。”
    有消息透露说，到那时，反主流派将追究岸信介的责任，并迫使他辞职。
