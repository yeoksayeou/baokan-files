Xinhua News Agency, April 1st—To support spring ploughing and guarantee a bumper harvest of food and cotton, commercial departments in Beijing, Henan, and Jiangsu are transferring seeds and agricultural implements to the countryside.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 1st—Commercial departments at all levels in Beijing are providing multifaceted support to spring ploughing production in the suburban rural areas. To date, commercial departments have supplied people's communes with over 800,000 jin of spring vegetable seeds, over 6 million jin of chemical fertilizers, as well as pesticides, farm tools, and other supplies. The supply of vegetable seeds has more than doubled compared to the same period last year.
    This year, the task of spring ploughing in the suburbs of Beijing is very heavy, with the area sown to vegetables alone doubling compared to last year. In response to the new situation of greatly increased demand for agricultural production materials, commercial departments at all levels began actively organizing supplies as early as the fourth quarter of last year. At the end of February and the beginning of March this year, commercial departments at all levels established working groups or production materials supply offices specifically responsible for surveying, transferring, and supplying spring ploughing production materials.
    Commercial departments also formed working groups to investigate the situation of miscellaneous fertilizers in factories, government offices, and service industries, organizing people's communes to form ties with these units to increase fertilizer sources.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 1st—Commercial departments in Henan Province are vigorously organizing the supply of production materials to support spring ploughing production.
    Spring ploughing in Henan Province started early this year, and wheat field management is being handled more tightly than last year. Therefore, the demand for production materials is greater and earlier than in previous years. As of March 20th, commercial departments throughout the province have supplied people's communes with over 80 million jin of chemical fertilizers, over 8.31 million jin of various pesticides, power irrigation machinery with over 12,800 horsepower, and tens of millions of various small farm tools, effectively supporting spring ploughing production in various regions.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 1st—The supply of spring production materials in Jiangsu this year has been done both quickly and well. By early March, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Commerce had transferred production materials worth a total of over 140 million yuan to various counties, an increase of 55% over the same period last year. Local sources organized by commercial departments in various regions are estimated to be more than double the amount allocated by the province.
    In order to support this year's great spring ploughing production, commercial departments in various regions of Jiangsu, under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, have inventoried and assessed the sources of various production materials this year. They have also dispatched more than 20,000 staff members to go deep into various communes and production teams to promote various indigenous production methods and vigorously organize local sources. According to incomplete statistics from early March, people's communes throughout the province have produced 1.78 million tons of indigenous fertilizer and 7,930 tons of indigenous pesticides. Commercial departments in some areas have also helped communes produce indigenous glass, indigenous saltpeter, indigenous alkali, and indigenous tannin extract.
    In terms of the repair and supply of farm tools, commercial departments in various regions of Jiangsu have played a significant role. They have assisted communes and production teams in inventorying and assessing needs, and have relied on communes to organize blacksmiths and carpenters to engage in rush processing and repair of old tools. For example, under the unified arrangement of the Party committee, the Taicang County Commercial Department organized 369 workers, adopting a method of clearing one team at a time, and quickly repaired 3,109 large and small farm tools.

    支援春耕保证粮棉丰收
    北京河南江苏商业部门调运种子农具下乡
    据新华社1日讯　北京市各级商业部门多方支援郊区农村春耕生产，到目前为止，由商业部门供应人民公社的春季蔬菜种籽已有八十多万斤，化学肥料六百多万斤，还有农药、农具等，其中菜籽的供应量比去年同期供应量增加一倍多。
    北京市郊区今年春耕生产任务很大，只是蔬菜播种面积就比去年扩大了一倍。各级商业部门针对农村生产资料需要量大大增加的新情况，早在去年第四季度开始就积极组织货源，今年2月底3月初，各级商业部门又成立工作组或生产资料供应办公室，专门负责春耕生产资料的摸底和调运供应工作。
    商业部门还组成工作组到工厂、机关、服务性行业调查杂肥情况，组织人民公社与这些单位挂钩，增加肥源。
    据新华社郑州1日电  河南省商业部门大力组织生产资料的供应，支援春耕生产。
    河南省今年春耕开始早，麦田管理比去年抓得更紧，因此，对生产资料的需要也比往年更多、更早。截至3月20日为止，全省各地商业部门已经给人民公社供应化学肥料八千多万斤，各种农药八百三十一万多斤，动力灌溉机械一万二千八百多马力，各种小农具几千万件，有力地支援了各地春耕生产。
    新华社南京1日电　江苏今年的春季生产资料供应工作做得既快又好。到3月上旬，江苏省商业厅已调给各县的生产资料，价值共达一亿四千多万元，比去年同期增长55％；各地商业部门组织的地方货源，估计比省调拨的要多一倍以上。
    为了支援今年的春耕大生产，江苏各地商业部门在各级党委统一领导下，对今年的各种生产资料货源进行排队摸底，还抽出两万多名工作人员，深入各个公社、生产队，推行各种土法生产，大力组织地方货源。据3月上旬不完全统计，全省各人民公社已生产土化肥一百七十八万吨，土农药七千九百三十吨。有些地区的商业部门还帮助公社生产土玻璃、土硝、土碱、土栲胶等。
    在农具的整修和供应工作方面，江苏各地商业部门发挥了很大的作用。他们帮助公社、生产队进行排队摸底，并且依靠公社组织铁工木工突击加工、修旧。如太仓县商业部门在党委统一安排下，组织了三百六十九个工人采取到一队清一队的办法，很快修好了三千一百零九件大小农具。（附图片）
