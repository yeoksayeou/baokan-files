Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 16th. General Challe, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces stationed in Algeria, when interviewed by a reporter from the Spanish newspaper "Vanguardia," stated that he wanted to wage an indefinite war and opposed any negotiations with the Algerian government.

Challe said: "It is certain that the French army will not withdraw recently, because the task given by General de Gaulle is to establish an increasingly French Algeria, and this task is a long-term one."

While clamoring for a long-term war, Challe, disregarding the facts, insisted that the Algerian National Liberation Army currently has only 25,000 men. These two statements are contradictory.

　　法军驻阿尔及利亚总司令
　　叫嚷侵阿战争无限期打下去
    新华社巴黎16日电　驻阿尔及利亚法军总司令夏耳将军接见西班牙“先锋队”报记者时，表示要进行无限期的战争，并且反对同阿尔及利亚政府进行任何谈判。
    夏耳说：“可以肯定，法军最近不会撤走，因为戴高乐将军交付的任务是要建立一个愈来愈法国化的阿尔及利亚，这个任务是长期的。”
    夏耳一面叫嚣要进行长期的战争，一面又不顾事实，硬说阿尔及利亚民族解放军目前仅有二万五千人。这两种说法是自相矛盾的。
