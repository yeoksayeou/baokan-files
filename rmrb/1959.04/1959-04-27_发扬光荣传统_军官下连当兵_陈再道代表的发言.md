Carry Forward the Glorious Tradition: Officers Going Down to the Company to Serve as Soldiers
Speech by Representative Chen Zaidao

Chairman, Fellow Deputies:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the reports of Vice-Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen.

Since the First Session of the First National People's Congress, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our people have achieved brilliant successes in socialist revolution and socialist construction. In 1958, the Party formulated the General Line for socialist construction. In that year, China's national economy achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. This is the victory of the Party's General Line for socialist construction. We firmly believe that under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the Chinese people will continue to leap forward in 1959!

In Premier Zhou's report, it was pointed out: "In the past year, state personnel have made significant progress in going deep among the masses. The broad masses of cadres have corrected their ideas and work styles of varying degrees of separation from the masses, overcome the bureaucratic airs, lethargy, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness that they contracted from the old society, and appeared among the masses as ordinary laborers… Leading cadres in rural work regularly go to the communes to be commune members, leading cadres in factories regularly go to the workshops to be workers, commanders of troops regularly go to the companies to be soldiers, and all leading cadres who are physically fit regularly participate in physical labor, which is forming a new trend. This is a revolutionary, communist trend."

More than 150,000 Cadres Go Down to the Company to Serve as Soldiers, Living and Working Together with the Soldiers

Just as Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, in the People's Liberation Army, Chairman Mao's call for army cadres to serve as soldiers for one month each year has become a system and has been adhered to. Last October, as soon as Chairman Mao's call was conveyed to the troops, it was immediately enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of cadres. They signed up one after another, requesting to be the first batch to go down to the company to serve as soldiers. Under the leadership of senior cadres, cadres serving as soldiers quickly formed a vigorous mass movement in the troops. By February of this year, more than 150,000 cadres throughout the army had gone down to the company to serve as soldiers, including more than 160 generals. Although the measure of cadres serving as soldiers has only been implemented for more than half a year, it has already had an extremely significant impact on the construction of the troops.

Cadres going down to the company to serve as soldiers is of extreme significance for cultivating a spirit of communist equality, eliminating the "three airs and five vices," strengthening the relationship between cadres and soldiers, and enhancing the unity of the troops.

Our army is the people's army, and the relationship between officers and soldiers in our army is the relationship between ordinary laborers. They are equal to each other, with only different divisions of labor, and no distinction between high and low. As early as the initial founding of our army, Chairman Mao established the unity of officers and soldiers as one of the basic principles of army building. For decades, our army has always followed this principle in handling our internal relations. Equality between officers and soldiers is our army's inherent glorious tradition, and cadres going down to the company to serve as soldiers is a further development of this tradition under new conditions.

Cadres who go down to the company to serve as soldiers, in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and the General Political Department, take improving their own ideological work style and strengthening their ties with the masses of soldiers as their main purpose. After going down to the company, regardless of their position, they live, eat, work, labor, and entertain with the soldiers as ordinary soldiers, completely like soldiers, obeying the leadership of the squad and platoon leaders, conscientiously observing the various systems of the company, asking for leave when going out, reporting back upon return, being courteous, and acting as a model in everything. All public duties and chores in the company, whether it is fetching water, sweeping the floor, emptying the spittoons, or cleaning the toilets, they all rush to do them. These seem like small things, but to truly do them well, one must completely put down airs and eliminate bureaucratic tendencies.

Cadres Treat Soldiers with a Spirit of Equality, Soldiers Treat Cadres as Close Friends

Cadres truly put down their airs and blend in with the soldiers, they will have a deeper understanding of the soldiers, and the more they understand the soldiers, the more they will love the soldiers. All comrades who have gone down to the company to serve as soldiers feel the same way. After I went down to the company to serve as a soldier, living with those young soldiers, I felt that they were very pure and lovable. Their vigorous spirit and their momentum of not fearing difficulties and marching forward when doing work deeply infected me. I felt that I was much younger and added infinite strength. I thought to myself, with such good soldiers, there is no task that cannot be completed and no enemy that cannot be defeated!

Cadres truly put down their airs and blend in with the soldiers, it eliminates the estrangement between officers and soldiers. Soldiers talk and laugh with generals without any restraint. When walking, they put their arms around each other's shoulders, calling each other "Old Zhang," "Old Li," or "Old Comrade." They are willing to talk to us "old comrades" about what is on their minds, even things like finding a lover, and seek our opinions. Because cadres treat soldiers with a spirit of equality, soldiers treat cadres as close friends, and are more respectful and loving to cadres, and their concern is meticulous. When working, they are always afraid that you will get tired. As soon as you start to do something, several people rush to do it. Sometimes, even if you manage to grab it, they will persuade you to rest after a while, and even take away the tools. When I was a soldier in the company, in order to fetch water for comrades in the morning or sweep the floor, I sometimes had to pretend to go to the toilet and get up an hour or two earlier. They never let cadres who serve as soldiers do some heavy work, and even avoid letting you know about it. Sometimes, in order to get on a night watch, you have to pretend to be asleep and listen, and only get up and follow them when they call for the shift. When carrying soil, the soldiers always pull the soil baskets towards themselves. Whenever there is any danger, the soldiers will protect the cadres who serve as soldiers with their bodies. For example, when General Xu Shiyou was a soldier in the company participating in demolition exercises, the soldiers were afraid that the flying stones would hit him, so they automatically stood in front of him to protect him. In life, they are even more caring. When eating, they always want to give you a little more food. Sometimes, the soldiers quietly put the meat from their bowl into your bowl. They are happy when the cadre who is a soldier eats more, and if they eat less, they think they are not feeling well and are very worried. When the weather turns cold, they take out their clothes for you to wear. At night, they are afraid that you will be cold, so they quietly put their coats on you. The soldiers' love and care for cadres who are soldiers is entirely out of inner feelings. We comrades who go down to the company to serve as soldiers are all deeply moved by this friendship. Because of the deep feelings established with the soldiers, it is really difficult to part when the term of service expires. When leaving, the soldiers saw them off for a while, and then another while. The young soldiers cried, and the old generals were so moved that they could not stop the tears. With such deep friendship and close relationship between officers and soldiers, our army will always be invincible in the world.

Promoted the Leap Forward in All Aspects of Work, Changing the Spiritual Outlook of Officers and Soldiers

Cadres going down to the company to serve as soldiers further encourages the revolutionary zeal of the broad masses of officers and soldiers and promotes the Great Leap Forward in all aspects of our army's work. The soldiers are deeply moved when they see the cadres who come down to the company to serve as soldiers, especially the generals, doing everything the same as the soldiers, and rushing to do everything. They feel that these old cadres have fought north and south in the past, shedding blood and sweat for the revolution, and are old and weak, but they are still so energetic, so how can young lads not work hard? In training, learning, and productive labor, everyone strives to be the first and everyone leaps forward. Learning from the "old warriors" has become a powerful slogan to promote the Great Leap Forward of the troops. Some companies with relatively backward work have been transformed into model companies under the promotion and influence of cadres who serve as soldiers, and their tasks have been completed ahead of schedule or doubled. The masses reflect that the company that has a cadre serving as a soldier has a particularly full of political enthusiasm and particularly strong morale. Cadres serving as soldiers are indeed a huge driving force for the leap forward of the troops.

Cadres serving as soldiers not only changes their own spiritual outlook, but also changes the spiritual outlook of soldiers. In some soldiers, due to the influence of old class ideas, they always think that officers are one level higher than soldiers, and that being a soldier is not as glorious as being an officer, especially being a cook or a feeder. But when they saw officers, especially generals, going down to the company to be privates, cooks, and feeders like themselves, they immediately changed their view that officers are more noble than soldiers, and realized that there is only a different division of labor in doing revolutionary work, and there is no distinction between noble and humble, and the communist concept of equality has grown more firmly in their minds. There is such a story: A soldier in a certain company was transferred to work in the cooking squad and felt very dishonorable, so he did not want his relatives and friends to know, and did not write to his lover for three months. But later, a general came to the cooking squad to be a cook with him. He saw the general rushing to cook, stir-fry, sweep the floor, wipe the table, and serve meals to everyone every day. He was deeply moved and said to others: "Now I feel that being a cook is as glorious as doing other work."

Can cadres serving as soldiers, especially older cadres, persist? According to the experience of comrades who have gone down to the company to serve as soldiers, it can be persisted. I personally have this experience. At first, I was a little unaccustomed. After working, I felt pain in my waist and soreness in my legs, but it got better after I persisted. My appetite also increased, and I didn't have insomnia anymore. After a month of soldier life, my body became stronger and my weight increased. We older comrades are like this, and the younger ones have no problems. In addition, soldiers will take the initiative to take care of things that are beyond their physical strength and not let you do them.

The revolutionary measure of cadres going down to the company to serve as soldiers is of extreme significance for carrying forward the glorious tradition of unity between officers and soldiers in our army, strengthening the relationship between officers and soldiers, improving the style of leadership, and improving the revolutionary enthusiasm of the soldiers. We are determined to adhere to this system in order to better improve the leadership style of the army, strengthen the relationship between officers and soldiers, and contribute more to defending and building socialism together with the people of the whole country!

### 发扬光荣传统　军官下连当兵  陈再道代表的发言

专栏：

    发扬光荣传统　军官下连当兵
    陈再道代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的各项报告。
    自第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议以来，我国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设方面获得了辉煌的成就。一九五八年党制定了社会主义建设总路线，这一年，我国的国民经济获得了空前的大跃进。这是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利。我们深信，在总路线的光辉照耀下，我国人民在一九五九年将继续大跃进！
    在周总理的报告中指出：“在过去一年中，国家工作人员在深入群众方面有了显著的进步。广大干部纠正了不同程度的脱离群众的思想和作风，克服了从旧社会沾染来的官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气，并且以普通劳动者的姿态在群众中出现。……农村工作的领导干部定期到公社当社员，工厂的领导干部定期到车间当工人，部队的指挥员定期到连队当兵，一切有体力条件的领导干部定期参加体力劳动，正在形成新的风气。这是一种革命的、共产主义的风气。”
    十五万多名干部下连当兵和士兵共同生活共同操作
    正像周总理在报告中所提出的那样，在人民解放军中，毛主席关于军队干部每年当兵一个月的号召，已经成为一个制度坚持下来。去年十月间，毛主席的号召一传达到部队，立即得到广大干部的热烈拥护。纷纷报名，要求第一批下连当兵。在高级干部的带领下，干部当兵在部队中很快就形成一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动。到今年的二月止，全军下连当兵的干部，已达十五万余名，其中有将军一百六十多名。干部当兵这一措施，虽然开始实行只有半年多的时间，但这对部队的建设已经产生了极其重大的影响。
    干部下连当兵，对于培养共产主义平等精神，对于打掉三风五气，密切干部同士兵的关系，增强部队的团结，有极其重大的意义。
    我军是人民的军队，我军的官兵之间的关系，是普通劳动者之间的关系，彼此是平等的，只有职务的分工不同，没有高低贵贱之分。早在我军的初创时期，毛主席就把官兵一致确定为我军基本的建军原则之一。几十年来我军始终遵循着这一原则来处理我军的内部关系。官兵平等是我军固有的光荣传统，干部下连当兵，就是这一传统在新条件下的进一步发扬。
    下连当兵的干部，遵照着毛主席和总政治部的指示，把改进自身的思想作风，密切同士兵群众的联系为主要目的。下连后，不论职位高低，都以普通士兵的身分和士兵同吃、同住、同操作、同劳动、同娱乐，完全像士兵一样地听从班、排长的领导，认真遵守连队的各种制度，外出请假，回来销假，礼节周到，处处作模范。连队的一切公差勤务，不管是打水、扫地、倒痰盂、掏厕所，样样抢着干，这些看来是小事情，但要切实做到、做好，就非彻底放下架子，打掉官气不可。
    干部以平等精神对待士兵  士兵把干部当成知心朋友
    干部真正放下架子同士兵打成一片，对士兵就会有更深切的了解，对士兵越是了解，也就越爱士兵。这一点，下连当兵的同志都有同感。我下连当兵之后，同那些年青的士兵生活在一起，感到他们非常纯真、可爱，他们那种生气勃勃的精神和干起活来不怕困难一往无前的劲头，都给我很深的感染，感到自己也年青多了，增添了无限的力量，心想，有这样的好战士，没有完不成的任务，没有打不败的敌人！
    干部真正放下架子同士兵打成一片，就打消了官兵之间的隔阂，士兵同将军在一起说说笑笑毫无拘束，走起路来，扶肩搭背，称呼“老张”“老李”或“老同志”，他们心里的话，甚至像找爱人这样的事，都愿意和我们这样的“老同志”谈谈，征求我们的意见。由于干部以平等精神对待士兵，士兵就把干部当成知心朋友，更加尊重干部、爱护干部，关怀无微不至。干起活来他们总怕你累着，你一动手干什么，就有几个人来抢着干，有时你努力抢到手，干不了一会，他们就劝你休息，甚至抢走了工具。我在连队当兵时，为了能在早晨给同志们打点洗脸水或扫扫地，有时要装着上厕所，早起个把钟头。有一些重活，他们总不让当兵的干部去做，甚至避开不让你知道。有时为了争上一次夜班放哨，还要假睡听着，等他们叫班时立即爬起来跟着去才成。抬土的时候，战士总把土筐往自己身边拉，凡是有什么危险，战士就以身护住下连当兵的干部。如许世友上将在连队当兵参加爆破演习时，战士怕飞起的石块打着他，就自动站在他面前护着。在生活上，更是关怀备至。吃饭时，他们总想多分一点菜给你，有时，战士们悄悄地把他碗里的肉放到你的碗里。当兵干部的饭吃得多他们就高兴，吃得少，他们就认为是不舒服了，心里很着急。天一凉他们就把自己的衣服拿来给你穿，晚上睡觉，他们怕你冷，悄悄把大衣给你盖上。战士们对当兵干部这种爱护，完全是出于内心的感情，我们下连当兵的同志，都深深为这种友情所感动。由于同士兵相处建立了深厚的感情，因此在当兵期满离开部队时，真是难舍难分。走的时候士兵送了一程又一程，年青的士兵哭了，年老的将军也激动得止不住眼泪。军官同士兵有着这样深厚的友情和亲密的关系，我们的军队将永远无敌于天下。
    推动了各方面工作跃进  改变着官兵的精神面貌
    干部下连当兵，更加鼓舞广大官兵的革命干劲，推动了我军各方面工作的大跃进。士兵们看到下连当兵的干部，特别是将军，处处同士兵一样，样样事情抢着干，他们深受感动。他们觉得这些老干部过去南征北战，为革命流血流汗，年纪又大，身体又弱，都这样干劲冲天，年轻小伙子怎么能不好好干呢？在训练、学习、生产劳动中，人人争先，个个跃进。向“老战士”学习，成了推动部队大跃进的有力口号。有些工作比较落后的连队，在当兵干部的推动影响下，一变而为标兵连，任务都提前或加倍地完成了。群众反映，那个连队有当兵干部，那个连的政治情绪就特别饱满，士气就特别旺盛。干部当兵对于部队的跃进，确实是一股巨大的推动力量。
    干部当兵不仅改变着自己的精神面貌，而且也改变着士兵的精神面貌。在某些士兵中，由于受旧的等级观念的影响，总认为官比兵高一等，当兵不如当官光荣，尤其是当炊事兵、饲养兵更感到不光彩。可是当他们看到军官，特别是将军同自己一样下连当列兵、当炊事兵、饲养兵之后，立即改变了官贵兵贱的看法，认识到作革命工作只有分工不同，没有贵贱之分，共产主义的平等观念在他们脑子里更加牢固地成长起来了。有这样一个故事：某连一个战士调到炊事班工作，觉得很不体面，因此他不愿意让亲友知道，三个月没有给爱人写信。可是后来一位将军到炊事班同他一起当炊事员，他看到这位将军每天都抢着做饭炒菜，扫地，擦桌子，给大家端饭端菜，他深受感动，对别人说：“现在我感到当炊事兵和作其他工作一样都是非常光荣的。”
    干部下连当兵，特别是年纪大些的干部能否坚持得住呢？根据下连当兵同志的体会是可以坚持得住的。我个人也有这样的体会，开始是有些不大习惯，干活之后，感到腰痛、腿酸，但坚持下来就好了，饭量也增加了，也不失眠了，一个月的士兵生活身体变得更结实，体重增加了。我们年纪大些的同志都如此，年轻的更没有问题。另外一些体力所不及的事情，士兵们会主动关照不要你做。
    干部下连当兵这一革命措施，对于发扬我军官兵一致的光荣传统，密切官兵关系，改进领导作风，提高士兵群众的革命积极性，都有极其重大的意义。我们决心把这一制度坚持下去，以便更好地改进军队的领导作风，密切官兵关系，同全国人民一道，为保卫和建设社会主义贡献更大的力量！
