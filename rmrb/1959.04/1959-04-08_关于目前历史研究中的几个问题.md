Regarding Several Issues in Current Historical Research
Guo Moruo

I. The Direction of Historical Research

Today, the general direction of academic research should be to serve the people and socialist construction. Historical research is naturally no exception. Now that the direction has been determined, the question is how to proceed, that is, the question of method. This, too, is very clear: we must use the methods of Marxism-Leninism, namely, dialectical materialism and historical materialism. Historical research should also follow the mass line, collectively engaging in planned division of labor and cooperation. This will enable us to achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical" results.

Now that the direction has been determined and the method found, what should we do in the field of history? General history should be pursued, specialized history and dynastic history should also be pursued, and Party history should of course be pursued even more. In addition, research on world history and Asian history should be actively carried out. The scope of specialized history is very broad, including intellectual history, economic history, cultural history, literary history, etc. Within literary history, it can be further divided into the history of poetry, drama, novels, etc. In particular, the history of工艺史, this is part of the history of the creative labor of the working people. The handicrafts created by the working people are rich and colorful, and worthy of our attention. For example, there are many patterns of paper-cut, and other handicrafts made of grass and wood, ivory carvings, etc., are so numerous and ingenious as to be astonishing. However, we have not paid enough attention to the study of the history of工艺的发展, and we should pay more attention to it in the future.

A Chinese general history is a comprehensive history of the overall development of Chinese society. It is the unanimous expectation of everyone to compile a complete Chinese general history from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism. Of course, there are already Chinese general history works, but we hope that better general histories will be published. In addition to general history, specialized history, thematic history (such as the study of a historical figure or a historical fact), and especially the development history of various ethnic groups, etc., should all be paid attention to. In the past, Chinese historical books paid little attention to ethnic minorities, which was an abnormal situation and did not conform to historical truth. The development and contributions of various ethnic groups, their relationship with the Han nationality, etc., should all be carefully studied.

General history should be pursued, and dynastic history should also be pursued. There are two methods of断代. The old method is to divide into paragraphs according to dynasties, such as studying the history of the Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han... etc. dynasties. There is nothing inherently wrong with studying such dynastic history, the important thing is to see what position and what point of view and method is used to study it. As long as the position, viewpoint, and method are correct, even a historical figure or a historical fact should be studied, why can't the history of a dynasty be studied? The new method of断代 is to divide into paragraphs according to the five stages of social development. It goes without saying that such dynastic history should be studied.

In recent years, there has been an increasing number of industrial and mining enterprises, especially the people's communes, which are new things that have emerged recently. Many people are writing the history of industrial and mining enterprises and the history of communes, which is a good phenomenon. There is indeed much to be done in industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes, and there are many outstanding units that can serve as typical examples. Large-scale industries such as Anshan Iron and Steel and Kailuan, agriculture such as Anguo and Suiping, and even the Wang Guofan Cooperative in Zunhua, Hebei, praised by Chairman Mao, the so-called "poor stick cooperative," can all become typical examples. Writing out the development process of such typical units can serve as a demonstration for other units and is of educational significance to the people of the whole country. Therefore, it is very valuable to write the history of industrial and mining enterprises, the history of communes, or the history of other enterprises or institutions outside of industrial and mining communes, and to write them as well as possible. This is indeed a new aspect of historical research. However, I hope that the writing of the history of industrial and mining enterprises and the history of communes, etc., will not be placed in opposition to the pursuit of general history, specialized history, etc. In addition to providing typical examples, the history of industrial and mining enterprises and the history of communes mainly provide materials, which require us to further summarize and improve on this basis, so that local things become more comprehensive things. General history and specialized history are still needed, and the history of industrial and mining enterprises and the history of communes cannot replace general history and specialized history, but the writing of future general history and specialized history cannot be separated from the history of industrial and mining enterprises and the history of communes.

Who is more suitable to write the history of industrial and mining enterprises and the history of communes? I think it can be done by each unit itself. The cultural level of workers and peasants is increasing day by day, and they are fully capable of doing it. But it is also okay for professional cadres engaged in historical research to select several key units and go down to help them do it. It is worth promoting for historical professional cadres to go down and spend more time, say about three years, to help workers and peasants write the history of the development of each unit. Industrial and mining enterprises and communes are constantly developing, and their history cannot be written once and for all. Therefore, the historical professional cadres who are sent down need to have a system of regular "substitution," rotating down and continuing to help write. In this way, it is easy to write the history of typical units, and at the same time, it can train historical professional cadres, so that theory and practice can be well integrated.

Now the Chinese Academy of Sciences has the Institute of History and the Institute of Archaeology. The establishment of specialized research institutes to study history and cultural relics did not exist in ancient China. In ancient China, there were only official history writing halls or semi-official and private history writing groups, and their task was to focus on compiling the history of the previous generation. Today, the Institute of History mainly studies the history of the past from documents. I think the scope of business can also be expanded. The excellent traditions of history writing in ancient China need to be inherited. The work of the Institute of History should focus on history writing. In our country, there are many histories that should be written, but no one has been organized to write them, and even if they are being written, no better works have been written yet. For example, the May Fourth Movement, the May 30th Movement, the Hong Kong-Guangdong Strike, the Long March of the Red Army... etc., are all major events, but so far they have not been systematically narrated; the "Five Great Movements" and the "Three Great Transformations" carried out after the founding of the People's Republic of China have not yet been written on a scientific basis. These are all things that historical workers should do.

Using tasks to drive scientific research is a good way. Natural science research is already doing this, and social science research should also do the same. In terms of historical work, I think we can organize forces, stipulate tasks, and carry out work, such as forming a group to compile the history of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. By doing so, we can train talents and develop history. If we conduct research in isolation from tasks, it is not easy to achieve results. Recently, the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant units outside the academy have cooperated to collectively compile a Chinese general history, which can be regarded as a good start. Of course, in addition to collective compilation, we should also welcome individual writing. A hundred flowers can bloom in historical work, but we have neglected collective compilation in the past, which is worth noting.

II. The Issue of Breaking the Dynastic System

Old-era history books were for compiling genealogies for emperors, kings, generals, and ministers. That kind of compilation method should undoubtedly be discarded. Today, we are studying history, and it is right to break the feudal dynastic system.

But breaking the dynastic system does not mean that we should erase the dynasties in Chinese history. In fact, since dynasties existed, how can they be erased? What we want to break is the old historical viewpoint, the feudal orthodox viewpoint, and the method of compiling genealogies exclusively for emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, not simply erasing the dynasties. If our position and viewpoint are not correct, even if we erase the dynasties, we still cannot write historical works that are needed today.

The general direction and method of historical research have already been discussed above. Under the guidance of this general direction and method, it is permissible to study the history of a certain dynasty. There is no need to delete the titles, reign titles, etc. of these dynasties. In our view, Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han... etc. are just symbols like A, B, C, D... etc.; the titles of emperors are like surnames such as Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao... etc. The emperors' state titles, temple names, and reign titles in Chinese history have been passed down for thousands of years and are well known to everyone, so we will continue to use them, actually just as a kind of symbol. As for the chronology in history, if we only mention the reign title, such as Jian'an so many years, or Zhenguan so many years, people will not easily know how many years it is from now; if we only mention the Gregorian calendar so many years, it is not easy to know which dynasty it is, so it is advisable to adopt a dual-track system, that is, to list the dynastic calendar and the Gregorian calendar at the same time, which is very convenient for readers.

The emperors of all dynasties have surnames and names, but most people only remember their surnames, and few people can say their names. Some history books do not write the titles of the emperors (such as Emperor Chengzu of Ming, Emperor Taizong of Song, etc.) but directly write their names, which makes people not understand. When we call them emperors in historical works, it does not mean that we respect them; when we call them Taizu and Taizong, it does not mean that they are really our ancestors. In fact, they are just symbols. To completely erase the many titles of dynasties from Chinese history would be very inconvenient.

History is developing. In the past, many people believed that only ancient times were the golden age, and some pushed it to Tang Yao and Yu Shun, and some pushed it to Fuxi and Shennong. There were similar situations in foreign countries. It was not until the emergence of Marxism that people realized that history is developing. Not only the history of society is developing, but also the history of biology, the history of the earth, and the history of the entire universe are developing. In short, the later generations surpass the former, and the present is better than the past and more progressive than the past. For example, slave society is always more progressive than primitive society, and feudal society is always more progressive than slave society. If we can stand on the viewpoint of historical development and see that one stage is always more progressive than the previous stage, then we can study problems from the stage in which historical facts and historical figures are located, and it is easier to assess their value. On the contrary, if we use today's standards to measure history, then there will not be much that can be written and affirmed. And doing so, the so-called anti-historicism, is obviously wrong.

In short, since there were dynasties in Chinese history, it is not good not to mention them in history books. This is the case when writing general history, and it is also the case when writing specialized history. As mentioned earlier, the old dynastic studies should be retained, and of course they can also be included in the new dynastic studies (divided into paragraphs according to the five major stages of social development).

Starting from a new historical viewpoint, we should of course focus on writing about the activities of the working people, but since past societies were class societies, the activities of the ruling class cannot but be written about. If the activities of the ruling class are beneficial to the people of the time and beneficial to the development of the entire nation and the development of culture, we will affirm it; conversely, we will negate it. But negating it is not erasing it, but criticizing it. Therefore, the internal contradictions of the ruling class, even if they are sometimes dog-eat-dog, are worth writing about if they are of great importance. For example, the "Eight Princes Rebellion" of the Western Jin Dynasty was completely dog-eat-dog, but it led to the "Five Barbarians Invasion of China" and even the division of the Northern and Southern Dynasties for hundreds of years; it would be inappropriate not to mention it at all.

III. The Relationship between Historical Materials, Textual Research, and History

Studying history naturally requires historical materials. Marx advocated occupying as much data as possible, which also shows the importance of data for scientific research. After occupying historical materials, we must distinguish their authenticity, examine their age, discard their dross, and take their essence. This work of inspection is also the so-called textual research. These tasks are indispensable and should be affirmed. But it is, after all, the preliminary stage of historical research. Without historical materials, it is impossible to study history, and specializing in historical materials can never replace history. In the past, old historical workers stagnated in this preliminary stage and thought it was enough, saying that sorting out historical materials is history, which is obviously wrong.

There are many historical materials in China. In addition to written records such as official history and unofficial history, there are also many physical historical materials, such as unearthed cultural relics. Since the ten years since the founding of the country, millions of cultural relics have been excavated, including those from the Paleolithic Age and the Neolithic Age. In addition, there are many materials overseas, some of which are directly related to China, and some of which are not related but can be used for comparative research. For example, when we study Chinese slave society, we must comparatively study the historical materials of ancient Greece and Rome. It is well known that Engels used Morgan's materials on the American red race to study the origin of the state, family, and private property. We want to sort out and analyze such a vast amount of historical materials on the ground, underground, at home and abroad. Of course, it is impossible for one person to complete it, but we should divide the work, line up, and produce some authoritative reference books. This is very helpful for historical research. In this regard, we have done very little. This is a big project that requires everyone to cooperate.

After occupying historical materials, we need to sort out and analyze them. This is the second step in historical research. This requires us to distinguish the primary from the secondary in the many historical materials. Among the historical materials, there are important ones, secondary ones, and unimportant ones. I think that historical materials related to national development, economic development, and cultural development are of the utmost importance and should be collected and sorted out as a priority. These historical materials are not completely limited to written records. The things directly created by the working people are more reliable than written records. For the era without written records, we must rely on stone tools, pottery, etc. to study.

Economic and cultural phenomena in historical development were not much noticed in past history books. Among ancient historians, Sima Qian paid more attention to this aspect of materials. His "Historical Records" has eight books mainly recording culture, and "Treatise on the Balance" especially narrates the history of finance and economics. Some later dynastic histories and general histories (such as "Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government") neglected these issues. Today, we should pay special attention to economic issues in our historical research, and the collection and sorting out of these historical materials should be placed in the most important position.

Old historical scholars emphasized the so-called "four keys" in historical materials: age, official positions, geography, and bibliography. Judging from the viewpoint mentioned above, it is impossible to think that all of them are "keys." Of course, we cannot say that these are not worth studying. In fact, the importance of a certain historical material depends on the degree to which it is needed to solve the problem. For example, "age," if it is not isolatedly and meticulously verified, then it cannot be said in general that clarifying the age is useless. The issue of periodization in ancient history is an "age" issue. The same is true for "official positions." For example, the "Rites of Zhou" records that the Zhou Dynasty set up six officials according to heaven, earth, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and each official set up sixty positions, for a total of three hundred and sixty positions, which coincides with the three hundred and sixty degrees of the ecliptic and the number of three hundred and sixty days in a year. This is obviously something that some people with astronomical knowledge later made up and attached to the Zhou Dynasty's system. The actual situation would certainly not be like this. If we affirm that the "Rites of Zhou" is the etiquette of the Western Zhou, then we would say that the Western Zhou had already entered feudal society. "Geography" has always been closely related to historical research. The development of a nation is inextricably linked to the geographical conditions of its region. From the study of historical geography, we can see the general outline of the social, economic, and cultural development process of the past dynasties. As for "bibliography," the history books of past dynasties have "Treatises on Art and Literature." Although they only have bibliographies, we can also examine the cultural development of the time from this. Therefore, some of these historical materials are important and some are not important, and they are not necessarily all "keys."

Of course, there are many things in historical materials that are too cumbersome and unimportant. For example, some people examine whether Hong Xiuquan had a beard. Of course, such a question cannot be considered an important question. However, if someone wants to do it, I think he can do it, which is better than doing nothing. Because "bamboo heads and wood chips are all useful" (Tao Kan's words). These trivial things may be useful sometimes. For example, if we want to hang a portrait of Hong Xiuquan in a history museum, then it will be useful. Confucius said: "It is difficult to do nothing all day long when you are full. Is there no博奕(chess)? It is better to do it than nothing." I very much agree with this passage. Of course, this approach cannot be promoted. We cannot put a lot of manpower in these aspects, but we must guide everyone to focus on the big picture and concentrate their energy on the big cause.

After occupying and sorting out historical materials, how to use them is a more important issue in historical research. With historical materials, if they are not processed and studied according to the methods of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, it is like a cook having fish, meat, vegetables, and tofu but not cooking them, and it cannot be regarded as having made delicious dishes. The purpose of studying history is to use a large amount of historical materials to specifically explain the laws of social development. Today we are very fortunate that the study of history has extremely important convenient conditions, because Marx has very concisely explained the laws of social development in the preface to his book "Critique of Political Economy." Based on Marx's lighthouse-like explanation, we can critically use historical materials to compile general history, specialized history, and other historical works.

Of course, historical materials cannot replace history, but in historical research, it is empty and useless to have only the general principles of historical materialism without historical materials. A cook who only holds a cookbook but does not make a feast has not fulfilled the responsibility of a cook. It can be seen from this that it is impossible to study history without historical materials. Therefore, the work of collecting and examining historical materials cannot be completely negated. What we oppose is textual research for the sake of textual research and replacing history with historical materials. But if a few people must do that, I think they can do it, because this is better than "doing nothing all day long."

IV. The Issue of Evaluating Historical Figures

The evaluation of historical figures, like other aspects of historical research, should be carried out according to the principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism. As mentioned earlier, history is developing. When we evaluate a historical figure, we should take his historical era as the background and his role in the development of history as the standard, and conduct a comprehensive analysis, so that it is easier to correctly see his place in history.

According to this principle, I think there are many figures in history who should be affirmed. But some of them have been distorted and should be rehabilitated. Yin Zhou, Qin Shi Huang, and Cao Cao, who is currently being discussed, are all examples. Take Yin Zhou, for example, many history books say that he was a "tyrannical and immoral" and "licentious and shameless"昏君(foolish ruler) who did no good and did all kinds of bad things. But according to some existing historical materials, Yin Zhou was actually a very talented person, and his appearance was also dignified and tall, not as ferocious and terrible as people imagined. He did some good things for the development of the Chinese nation and made no small contribution to the unification of ancient China. When it comes to the unification of ancient China, people easily think of Qin Shi Huang. Qin Shi Huang was one of the outstanding figures in Chinese history. The unification of ancient China was the result of Qin Shi Huang, but Yin Zhou started it.

Yin Zhou once pacified the Dongyi. The Dongyi were the original inhabitants of the Yangtze River basin. In the late Yin Dynasty, they expanded greatly and developed to the Huai River basin and even to the present Shandong area. Yin Zhou spent a lot of effort to repel the expansion of the Dongyi and captured "hundreds of millions of Yi people" to be his own army, while King Wu of Zhou combined other ethnic groups in the southwest and northwest to attack his rear, resulting in Yin Zhou's failure due to the captured soldiers turning against him. But although Yin Zhou failed, the Huai River and Yangtze River basins that he opened up became the bases of Song, Chu, and Xu (the direct or allied ethnic groups of the Yin people). The Zhou people inherited the culture of the Yin Dynasty and developed in the north, while the states of Song, Chu, and Xu inherited the same culture and developed in the south. For hundreds of years in the Western Zhou Dynasty, the north and south were in fact hostile. But by the Spring and Autumn period, a trend of convergence gradually formed. The cultures came from the same source, so in the Spring and Autumn period, the north and south of China were in fact already "vehicles with the same track and writing with the same characters." From the ancient myriad of states to the twelve feudal lords to the seven heroes standing side by side to the great unification, this is the natural trend of Chinese historical development. Therefore, the unification of China was started by Yin Zhou and ended by Qin Shi Huang.

The reason why history books record that Yin Zhou was "tyrannical and immoral" etc. can be said to be due to the influence of the Zhou Dynasty's counter-propaganda. Regarding the rehabilitation of Yin Zhou, there is a passage in my "Bronze Age" "Refuting 'On Confucianism'" that may be used as a reference.

When evaluating the role of historical figures, we must be realistic, neither exaggerating nor shrinking. People tend to deny the emperors of all dynasties in general, which is actually inappropriate and should be analyzed specifically. Some emperors, such as Qin Shi Huang, Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Taizong of Tang, and even Kangxi and Qianlong, made contributions to the development of the nation, economy, and culture at that time, and we should give them a certain place.

In addition to examining the emperors of past dynasties in this way, we should especially correctly estimate the role of figures in ideology, literature, and science and technology in each era and attach importance to them. Past history books did not pay enough attention to this aspect, and generally focused on political descriptions, and did not write much about cultural development. In particular, the narrative of outstanding figures in science and technology seems particularly lacking. There is no need to blame the historians of the past for not paying attention to these, but today our new historical workers cannot but pay attention to them.

    关于目前历史研究中的几个问题
    郭沫若
    一　历史研究的方向问题
    在今天，作为学术研究总的方向来说，应该是为人民服务，为社会主义建设服务。史学研究的任务自然也不能例外。方向已确定了，问题是如何去走，亦即方法问题。这一点，同样也是很明确的，我们必须用马克思列宁主义的方法，即辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的方法。历史研究也应该走群众路线，集体地从事有计划的分工协作。这样就可以做到“多快好省”。
    方向确定了，方法也找到了，那么，在史学领域里，要搞些什么呢？通史应该搞，专业史、断代史也应该搞，党史当然更应该搞。此外，世界史、亚洲史的研究也要积极开展。专业史的范围很广，其中包括思想史、经济史、文化史、文学史等；在文学史中又可分为诗歌史、戏剧史、小说史等。特别是工艺史，这是劳动人民进行创造性劳动的历史的一部分。劳动人民创造的工艺品，丰富多彩，值得我们注意。例如剪纸的花样就很多，其他如用草木编制的、象牙雕刻的各种工艺品，花样之多且巧，足以惊人。但是，研究工艺发展的历史，我们还未予以充分注意，今后应该重视起来。
    一部中国通史，是中国整个社会的全面发展史。以马克思列宁主义的观点，编写出一部完整的中国通史，这是大家所一致期待的。当然，中国通史的著作，现在并非没有，但我们希望能有更好的通史编印出来。除通史外，专业史、专题史（如对某一个历史人物、某一件历史事实的研究）、特别是各民族的发展史等等，都应该注意。过去中国史书上所反映的中国历史，对于少数民族很少注意，这是一种不正常的情况，也是不符合历史真实的。各民族的发展和贡献，它们同汉族的关系等等，都应该好好研究。
    通史要搞，断代史也要搞。断代有两种方法。旧方法是以朝代为段落，譬如研究夏、商、周、秦、汉……等等朝代的历史。研究这样的断代史，本身并不能说有什么不对，重要的是看站在什么立场、用什么观点方法去研究。只要立场观点方法对头，历史上的某一个人物、某一件事实，尚且应该研究，为什么一个朝代的历史就不可以研究呢？断代的新方法是根据社会发展的五个时期来划分段落。应该研究这样的断代史，当然更不用说了。
    近几年来，工矿单位日益增多，特别是人民公社，更是最近出现的崭新的事物。很多人在编写工矿史、公社史，这是很好的现象。在工矿和人民公社中，真是大有可为，有很多出色的、可作为典型的单位。大型工业如鞍钢、开滦，农业如安国、遂平，乃至如毛主席称赞过的河北遵化王国藩合作社，即所谓“穷棒子社”，都可以成为典型。把这样的典型单位的发展过程写出来，对其他单位可起示范作用，对全国人民都有教育意义。所以编写工矿史、公社史，或者工矿公社之外的其它企业或机构的历史，并且尽可能把它们写好，这是很有价值的。这的确是历史研究的新的方面。但我希望不要把写工矿史、公社史等和搞通史、专业史等对立起来。工矿史、公社史除提供典型之外，主要在提供材料，需要我们在这基础上再加以总结、提高；使局部的东西成为更全面的东西。通史、专业史还是需要的，工矿史、公社史不能代替通史、专业史，但将来的通史、专业史的撰述却离不开工矿史和公社史。
    工矿史、公社史，由什么人来写比较合适呢？我看可由各个单位自己来搞。工农群众的文化水平日益提高，他们完全有力量来搞。但也无妨由从事历史研究的专业干部选择几个重点单位，下去帮助他们搞。历史专业干部下去，用较多的时间，比方三年左右，帮助工农群众写各该单位的发展史，这是值得提倡的。工矿、公社是在不断向前发展的，它们的历史也就不可能在一次就写完。因此，下放的历史专业干部需要有定期“瓜代”的制度，轮流下去，继续不断地帮助编写。这样，既便于写出典型单位的历史，同时也可以训练历史专业干部，使理论和实践很好地结合起来。
    现在中国科学院有历史研究所，还有考古研究所。设立专门的研究所来研究历史和文物，这在我国古代是没有的。中国古代只有官方的修史馆或半官方的、私人的修史集团，他们的任务，着重在编修前一代的历史。今天历史研究所所做的主要是从文献中研究以前的历史。我认为，业务范围还可以扩大。中国古代修史的优良传统有继承的必要。历史研究所的工作，应该侧重到修史方面来。在我国，有很多历史应该写，而还没有组织人来写，即使在写也还没有写出较好的著作来。例如，五四运动、五卅运动、省港罢工、红军长征……等等，都是轰轰烈烈的大事，可是至今还没有有系统地加以叙述；中华人民共和国成立后所进行的“五大运动”，“三大改造”，也还没有在科学的基础上写出著作。这都是历史工作者应该作的。
    以任务带动科学研究，是个好办法。自然科学的研究已经在这样作了，社会科学的研究也应该如此。在史学工作方面，我觉得可以组织力量，规定任务，来进行工作，譬如成立小组，编写抗美援朝史之类，这样做，既可以训练人才，也能发展史学。如果脱离任务，孤立地进行研究，是不容易搞出成绩来的。最近，科学院历史研究所和院外有关单位合作，集体地编写中国通史，这可以看作是一个良好的开端。当然，除集体编纂外，我们也应该欢迎个人撰述。史学工作中也尽可以百花齐放，只是集体编纂的工作，我们以前忽略了，这是值得注意的。
    二　打破王朝体系的问题
    旧时代的史书，是替帝王将相作家谱，那种编写方法，无疑地是应该抛弃了。我们今天研究历史，应该打破封建王朝体系，这是对的。
    但打破王朝体系，并不是要求把中国历史上的朝代抹掉。事实上既存在过朝代，如何能抹得掉呢？我们要打破的是旧的历史观点、封建正统观点、专为帝王将相作家谱的办法，而不是简单地把王朝抹掉。如果我们的立场、观点不对头，即使抹掉了王朝，也依然写不出为今日所需要的历史著作来。
    历史研究的总的方向和方法，前面已经谈过。在这个总的方向和方法的指导下，研究某一个朝代的历史是允许的。这些朝代的称号、年号等等，也没有删掉的必要。在我们看来，夏、商、周、秦、汉……等不过是A、B、C、D……等符号；帝王的称号，也犹如张、王、李、赵……等姓氏一样。中国历史上帝王的国号、庙号、年号；几千年传下来，已为大家所熟知的，就沿用它们，实际上也只是当作一种符号罢了。至于历史上的编年，如果单提年号，如说建安若干年，或贞观若干年，人们不容易马上知道究竟距今多少年；如单提公元若干年，也不容易马上知道究竟是何朝代，因此，以采用双轨制为宜，即把王朝纪年和公元纪年同时并列，这对读者是很方便的。
    历代的帝王，都是有姓名的，但一般人只记得他们的姓，至于名字，就很少有人说得出。有的历史书上不写帝王的称号（如明成祖、宋太宗等）而直接写他们的名字，这样反而使人不懂。我们在历史著作中称他们为帝，并非表示对他们尊敬；称他们为太祖太宗，也并非就真是我们的祖宗。实际上都不过是一种符号而已。要从中国历史上把王朝的许多称号完全抹去，反而有很多不方便。
    历史是发展的。过去，许多人认为只有古代才是盛世，有人推到唐尧虞舜，有人推到伏羲神农。在外国也有类似的情况。直到马克思主义出现以后，人们才弄清楚历史是发展的。不仅社会的历史是发展的，而且生物的历史、地球的历史、整个宇宙的历史也都是发展的。总而言之，是后来者居上，现在比过去好，比过去进步。譬如奴隶社会总要比原始社会进步，封建社会总要比奴隶社会进步。我们如果能够站在历史发展的观点上，看到这一个阶段总比前一个阶段进步，这样就能够从历史事实和历史人物所处的那个阶段上去研究问题，比较容易评定它们的价值。相反的，如果用今天的标准去衡量历史，那么，可以写的，可以肯定的，就不多了。而这样做，即所谓反历史主义，显然是不对的。
    总之，中国历史上既有王朝存在，在史书中就不好不提。写通史是这样，写专业史也是这样。前面已经讲过，旧的断代研究应该予以保留，当然也可以把它们包括在新的断代（以社会发展五大分期为段落）研究中去。
    从新的历史观点出发，固然应该着重写劳动人民的活动，但以往的社会既是阶级社会，统治阶级的活动也就不能不写。统治阶级的活动对当代的人民有利，对整个民族的发展和文化的发展有利，我们就肯定它；相反的，我们就否定它。但否定它并不是抹杀，而是批判。所以统治阶级的内部矛盾，即使有时是狗咬狗，如果关系重大，也值得写。例如西晋的“八王之乱”完全是狗咬狗，但招致了“五胡乱华”，甚至南北朝好几百年的分裂；完全不提，那是不妥当的。
    三　史料、考据和历史学
            的关系问题
    研究历史当然要有史料。马克思主张尽可能地占有大量资料，也说明资料对科学研究的重要。占有了史料，就必须辨别它的真假，查考它的年代，去其糟粕，取其精华，这一番检查的功夫，也就是所谓考据。这些工作是不可少的，是应该肯定的。但它毕竟是历史研究的初步阶段。没有史料固然不能研究历史，专搞史料也决不能代替历史学。过去，旧的史学工作者停滞在这初步阶段，就认为很够了，说什么整理史料即历史学，这显然是错误的。
    中国的史料很多，除去正史、野史这些文字记载外，还有许多实物史料，如出土的文物等。建国十年以来，发掘出的文物，包括从旧石器时代、新石器时代以来的，就达几百万件之多。另外，在海外也有许多资料，有的和中国直接有关，有的虽无关系，但也可用来作比较研究。譬如我们研究中国的奴隶制社会，就要比较地研究古希腊、罗马的史料。恩格斯就曾利用摩尔根关于美洲红色人种的资料研究国家、家庭和私有制的起源，这是大家都知道的。地上地下，海内海外，这样浩如烟海的史料，我们要加以整理和分析，当然不可能由一个人来完成，而应该分分工，排排队，搞出些有权威性的工具书来。这对历史研究是很有帮助的。在这方面，我们作的还很少。这是一件大工程，需要大家分工合作。
    占有史料以后，要加以整理分析，这是历史研究的第二步。这就要求我们在那么繁多的史料中分清主次。在史料中，有重要的、次要的、也有无关重要的。我认为，对民族的发展、经济的发展、文化的发展等有关的史料是头等重要的，应该尽量搜集，优先整理。这方面的史料，不完全限于文字记载上的，劳动人民直接创造的东西，比文字记载还可靠。对没有文字记载的时代，就要靠石器、陶器等来研究。
    历史发展中的经济现象和文化现象，在过去的史书中是不大被人注意的。在古代的史学家中，司马迁比较重视这方面的材料，他的“史记”中就有八书主要记载文化，就中如“平准书”更特别叙述财经方面的历史。以后的有些断代史和通史（如“通鉴”之类），对这些问题就很忽视了。我们今天研究历史，应该特别重视有关经济方面的问题，这些方面的史料的搜集和整理，应该放在最重要的地位。
    旧的历史学者，对史料讲究所谓“四把钥匙”，即年代、职官、地理、目录。从前面所讲的观点来衡量，就不可能认为都是“钥匙”了。当然，我们也不好说这些都值不得研究。其实某一项史料的重要与否，要看它对问题解决的需要程度而定。例如“年代”，如果不是孤立地、事无巨细地去考证它，那也不能笼统地说弄清楚年代就没有用，古代史分期问题就是“年代”问题。“职官”也是如此。譬如“周礼”上记载周朝按天、地、春、夏、秋、冬分设六官，官各设六十职，共三百六十职，恰合黄道周天三百六十度和一年三百六十日之数。这显然是后来有些天文知识的人搞出来附会到周朝的制度上去的，实际情况当然不会是这样。如果肯定“周礼”是西周的典礼，那就会把西周说成为已进入封建社会了。“地理”，与历史研究的关系向来是很密切的，一个民族的发展，和它所在区域的地理条件，有不可分割的关系；从历史地理的研究中，尽可以看出历代社会经济和文化发展过程的概况。至于“目录”，历代史书多有“艺文志”，虽仅具目录，但据此也可考察当时的文化发展情况之一斑。所以搞这些史料，有的重要，有的不重要，不一定都是“钥匙”。
    当然，史料中有不少是过于繁琐的、无关重要的东西。例如，有人考证洪秀全有没有胡子，这样的问题，当然不能认为是什么重要的问题。不过，如果有人要搞，我认为也可以由他搞去，这总比什么也不搞要强。因为“竹头木屑，皆为有用”（陶侃语）。这些琐碎的东西，说不定有时也用得上。例如在历史博物馆里要挂洪秀全的像，那就用得上了。孔子说：“饱食终日，无所用心，难矣哉。不有博奕者乎？为之犹贤乎已。”我很赞同这段话。当然，这种做法不能提倡，不能把很多的人力放在这些方面，要引导大家从大处着眼，把精力集中在大的事业上。
    占有和整理了史料，如何运用它们，这是历史研究中更重要的问题。有了史料，如果没有根据辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的方法加以处理研究，好像炊事员手中有了鱼、肉、青菜、豆腐而没有烹调出来一样，不能算作已经做出了可口的菜。研究历史的目的，是要用大量的史料来具体阐明社会发展的规律。今天我们很幸运，研究历史有了极重要的方便条件，因为社会发展规律，马克思在“政治经济学批判”一书的序中已很扼要地说明了。我们根据马克思这一灯塔似的说明，就有可能批判地利用史料，编写出通史、专业史和其他历史著作来。
    固然，史料不能代替历史学，但在历史研究中，只有历史唯物主义的一般原理而没有史料，那是空洞无物的。炊事员仅抱着一部烹调术，没有做出席面来，那算没有尽到炊事员的责任。由此看出，没有史料是不能研究历史的。因而，对搜集、考察史料的工作，不能一概加以否定。我们反对的是为考据而考据，以史料代替史学。但如有少数人一定要那样作，我认为也可以由他去，因为这总比“饱食终日，无所用心”的要好一些。
    四　历史人物的评价问题
    对历史人物的评价，如同其他方面的历史研究一样，应该根据辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的原理来进行研究。前面已经提到，历史是发展的，我们评定一个历史人物，应该以他所处的历史时代为背景，以他对历史发展所起的作用为标准，来加以全面的分析，这样就比较易于正确地看清他们在历史上所应处的地位。
    根据这样的原则，我认为历史上有不少人物是应该肯定的。但其中有些人还受到歪曲，应该替他们翻案。殷纣王、秦始皇和最近正在讨论的曹操，都是。就拿殷纣王来说，许多史书上都说他是“暴虐无道”、“荒淫无耻”的昏君，好事不做，坏事做绝，简直要不得。但据现有的一些史料来分析，殷纣王倒实在是一个很有才能的人，相貌也很端庄魁梧，并非如人们想像中那么狰狞可怕。他对中国民族的发展，做了一些好事，对古代中国的统一，有不小的功劳。提到古代中国的统一，人们很容易想到秦始皇。秦始皇是中国历史上有数的杰出人物，古代中国归于一统是由秦始皇收其果，而却由殷纣王开其端。
    殷纣王曾经平定了东夷。东夷是长江流域的先住种族，在殷代末期有很大的扩张，发展到了淮河流域，甚至到了现今的山东地带。殷纣王费了很大的力量，打退了东夷的扩张，俘虏了“亿兆夷人”作自己的军队，而周武王却结合起西南和西北的其他种族来打他的后路，结果由于俘虏兵掉头而使殷纣王失败了。但殷纣王虽然失败了，他所开拓出来的淮河流域和长江流域却成为宋、楚、徐（殷人的直系或同盟种族）的根据地。周人因袭着殷代的文化在北方发展，宋、楚、徐等国承继着同一文化在南方发展。西周几百年间，南北事实上是敌对的。但到春秋时代便逐渐形成了合流的形势。文化是同出于一源，故在春秋时，中国的南北事实上已经是“车同轨、书同文”了。由古代万国而十二诸侯而七雄并列而大一统，这是中国历史发展的自然趋势。故中国的统一是殷纣王开其端，而秦始皇收其果。
    史书上所以记载殷纣王“暴虐无道”等等，可说是受了周朝反宣传的影响。关于殷纣王的翻案，我在“青铜时代”的“驳‘说儒’”中有一段文字，似乎可供参考。
    评定历史人物的作用，我们一定要实事求是，不夸大、也不缩小。人们对各朝各代的帝王，往往容易一概否定，其实这是不妥当的，应该具体分析。有些帝王，如秦始皇、汉武帝、唐太宗，甚至如康熙、乾隆等，对民族、对经济、对文化等方面的发展，在当时是有过贡献的，我们就应该给以一定的地位。
    除去对历代帝王应该这样考察以外，各个时代中有关思想、文学、科学技术方面的人物，尤其应该正确地估计他们的作用，加以重视。过去的历史书，在这方面的注意是不够的，一般都是偏重在政治方面的记述，对文化发展的情况写得不多。特别是对科学技术方面的杰出人物的叙述，显得尤其贫乏。过去的史学家没有重视这些，也不必责怪他们；可是今天我们的新史学工作者，却不能不加以重视了。
