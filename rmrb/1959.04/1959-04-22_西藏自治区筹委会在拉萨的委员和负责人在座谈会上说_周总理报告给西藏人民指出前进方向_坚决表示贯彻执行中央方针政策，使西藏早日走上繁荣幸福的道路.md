Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 21st. Members of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Lhasa, heads of various units of the Preparatory Committee, and representatives from all sectors held a discussion meeting yesterday to study and discuss Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report delivered at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress. Everyone unanimously endorsed Premier Zhou's report in their speeches, believing that the part of the report concerning Tibet completely conformed to the actual situation in Tibet, pointed out the direction for the Tibetan people, and expressed their firm determination to implement it in accordance with the central government's policies.

In their speeches at the meeting, people used many specific facts to illustrate that the central government has consistently granted the Tibetan people the rights to autonomy and freedom of religious belief, and that all work in Tibet has been carried out in accordance with the wishes of the Tibetan people and with respect for the opinions of upper-level figures; however, the former Tibetan local government has consistently violated the instructions of the central government and the will of the Tibetan people. Lhamin Yeshe Tsultrim, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, said: The Seventeen-Article Agreement stipulates the expulsion of imperialist forces from Tibet, but they not only failed to do so, but also colluded with imperialism to carry out rebellion. The central government said that reforms could be postponed for six years, but they wanted to never change. Sangpo Tenzin Wangchuk, Standing Committee Member and former Kalon of the Tibetan local government, said: The Tibetan people love the motherland, and the people will not go down the wrong path. Khensur Jampa Chilai of Drepung Monastery, a member of the committee, said: A small number of rebellious elements cannot represent the 1.2 million people of Tibet. Participants in the discussion unanimously supported the policy of gradually carrying out democratic reforms in Tibet, as mentioned in Premier Zhou's report, and demanded that reforms be carried out as soon as possible to alleviate the suffering of the working people. Gyatsoling Living Buddha said: The lives of the broad masses of working people in Tibet are very painful, and they urgently demand reform to improve their lives. However, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique fundamentally did not consider the interests of the people in carrying out reforms, but instead used the name of religion to oppose reform, attempting to protect their personal interests. Huo Kangse, Section Chief of the Preparatory Committee, said: The central government has always been patient and waited on the issue of reform in Tibet, but the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique vainly attempted to never change. With the exception of a very small number of people, all 1.2 million people in Tibet hope for reform, because they live a very poor life, working all day long, without enough to eat or wear. The speakers all hoped to make preparations as soon as possible and carry out reforms at an early date so that Tibet could embark on the road to prosperity and happiness like other fraternal ethnic regions.

Many people thanked the central government for consistently respecting the religious freedom of the Tibetan people in their speeches, and exposed the rebellious elements' destruction of religious beliefs. Khensur Jampa Chilai of Drepung Monastery said: The rebellious elements established the "Defend Religion Army." What kind of "Defend Religion Army" is it? They placed cannons on top of the Potala Palace and in the lama temples, and forced the lamas to arm themselves and carry out armed rebellion. Some abbots of temples wore kasayas but acted as bandits. Jiang Jin·Suolangjiebu, a famous Tibetan scholar and member of the Preparatory Committee as well as Director of the Cultural and Educational Department, said: The rebels call themselves "protectors of religion," but they kill people with guns, rape, rob, and commit all kinds of evil. They are not true Buddhists, as the first precept of Buddhism prohibits killing.

High-ranking officials and low-level staff of the former Tibetan local government and representatives from all walks of life in Tibet who participated in the work of the Preparatory Committee unanimously expressed in their speeches that they would strengthen unity and work together to do a good job in the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region. Jiantong Losang Langjie, member of the Preparatory Committee and Director of the Construction Department, said: In the past, due to the obstruction of upper-level reactionary elements, social reform work was not carried out. Now, no one is preventing us from taking the socialist road. Deputy Secretary-General Lhamin Yeshe Tsultrim said: A new page has begun in Tibet. Under the leadership of the central government and the guidance of the Preparatory Committee, I will do my best to work, hoping that everyone will unite and work together. He said: Due to the obstruction of the former Tibetan local government, some officials of the former Tibetan local government had some difficulties in their work in the past, but now these difficulties have disappeared completely, and we are all on the same path.

    西藏自治区筹委会在拉萨的委员和负责人在座谈会上说
    周总理报告给西藏人民指出前进方向
    坚决表示贯彻执行中央方针政策，使西藏早日走上繁荣幸福的道路
    新华社拉萨21日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会在拉萨的委员、筹委会各单位负责人和各界代表昨天举行座谈会，学习和讨论周恩来总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告。大家在发言中一致拥护周总理的报告，认为报告中有关西藏的部分完全符合西藏的实际情况，给西藏人民指出了前进的方向，并表示坚决按照中央的方针政策贯彻执行。
    在会上发言的人，用许多具体事实说明中央一贯给予西藏人民自治权利和宗教信仰自由，对于西藏的一切工作，都是按照西藏人民的意愿和尊重上层人士意见的；而原西藏地方政府却一贯违背中央的指示和西藏人民的意志。筹委会副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣说：十七条协议规定要驱逐帝国主义势力出西藏，他们不仅不这样做，反而勾结帝国主义进行叛乱。中央说在六年内可以不进行改革，而他们却想永远不改。常务委员、曾任原西藏地方政府噶伦桑颇·才旺仁增说：西藏人民是热爱祖国的，人民是不会走错道路的。委员、哲蚌寺堪苏江巴赤烈说：少数叛乱分子代表不了西藏一百二十万人民。　　参加座谈会的人在发言中，一致拥护周总理报告中提到的关于在西藏逐步进行民主改革的方针，并要求尽快地进行改革，解除劳动人民的痛苦。嘉措林活佛说：西藏广大劳动人民的生活是非常痛苦的，他们迫切要求改革，改善自己的生活。但是原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团根本不考虑人民的利益来进行改革，反而利用宗教的名义来反对改革，企图保护他们个人的利益。筹委会科长霍康色说：中央对西藏的改革问题一直忍耐、等待，但原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团却妄想永远不改。西藏一百二十万人除了极少数人以外，都是希望改革的，因为他们过着非常贫苦的生活，终日劳动，吃不饱穿不暖。发言者都希望尽快作好准备，早日进行改革，以便西藏和其他兄弟民族地区一样走上繁荣幸福的道路。
    许多人在发言中感谢中央一贯尊重西藏人民的宗教信仰自由，并揭露了叛乱分子破坏宗教信仰的情况。哲蚌寺堪苏江巴赤烈说：叛乱分子成立“卫教军”，它是什么样的“卫教军”呢？他们把大炮架在布达拉宫上面，架在喇嘛寺里，并强迫喇嘛武装起来进行武装叛乱。有些寺庙的堪布，穿的是袈裟，当的是叛匪。西藏著名学者、筹委会委员兼文教处处长江金·索朗杰布说：叛匪自称为“宗教保护者”，但他们却持枪杀人、奸淫、抢劫，无恶不作。他们不是真正的佛教徒，佛教教义第一条就规定不许杀生。
    参加座谈会的原西藏地方政府高级官员、低级职员和西藏各地各界参加筹委会工作的代表们，在发言中一致表示要加强团结，共同努力作好自治区筹委会的工作。筹委会委员兼建设处处长詹东·洛桑朗杰说：过去由于上层反动分子的阻挠，没有进行社会改革工作，现在已没有人阻止我们走社会主义道路了。副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣说：西藏已开始了新的一页，在中央的领导下，在筹委会的指导下，我要尽自己所有的力量进行工作，希望大家团结一致，共同努力。他说：由于原西藏地方政府的阻挠，过去有些原西藏地方政府的官员，工作起来有些困难，现在已经根本没有这些困难了，我们大家已走在一条道路上。
