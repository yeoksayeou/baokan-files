Editor's Note: The so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama," distributed in Tezpur on April 18 through Indian diplomatic officials, has not only aroused unanimous condemnation from people of all ethnic groups in our country, but also, in foreign public opinion circles, many people have pointed out that the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" has many loopholes and doubted whether it is actually the Dalai Lama's own statement. On the rostrum of the recent National People's Congress, representatives pointed out that this statement has nothing in common with the Dalai Lama's usual words and deeds, and is completely imposed on the Dalai Lama by others. The following is a compilation of the Dalai Lama's important statements since liberation, compared with the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama." Readers can make their own judgments from this as to what is true and what is false.

I. Was the Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet reached under "pressure"?

The so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" states: "In 1951, under the pressure of the Chinese government, the Seventeen-Article Agreement between China and Tibet was reached." However, the Dalai Lama previously believed that this agreement was signed "on the basis of unity and friendship"; and believed that this agreement enabled the Tibetan people to "begin to embark on a bright road of freedom and happiness."

On October 24, 1951, the Dalai Lama sent a telegram to Chairman Mao expressing his support for the Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. In the telegram, he said: "This year, the Tibetan local government specially dispatched five plenipotentiary representatives, including Kalon Ngapoi, to Beijing in April 1951 to conduct peace talks with the plenipotentiary representatives designated by the Central People's Government. The representatives of both sides, on a friendly basis, signed the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet on May 23, 1951. The Tibetan local government and the Tibetan monks and laypeople unanimously support it, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, actively assist the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet to consolidate national defense, expel imperialist forces from Tibet, and protect the unification of the motherland's territorial sovereignty."

In his report at the founding meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region on April 24, 1956, the Dalai Lama said: "In 1951, I sent representatives to Beijing to negotiate with representatives from the Central People's Government. On the basis of unity and friendship, the Agreement between the Central People's Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was signed. Since then, the Tibetan people have been forever freed from the enslavement and control of imperialism, returned to the great family of the motherland, and, like the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland, have fully enjoyed all the rights of national equality and begun to embark on a bright road of freedom and happiness, building their own prosperous and happy lives on the general road of building a socialist motherland." He also said: "The Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was formulated in accordance with the Chinese Communist Party's policy of national equality and the specific situation and demands of Tibet at that time. It fully conforms to the interests of the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland. It points out the road to liberation for the Tibetan people and is our program of action for this period; conscientiously implementing the various provisions of the agreement is our sacred and glorious task."

On May 23, 1958, the seventh anniversary of the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama's congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and the State Council also stated that in the past seven years, "the People's Liberation Army and staff working in Tibet, as well as the monks and laypeople of Tibet, have actively implemented the seventeen-article agreement."

II. Support for national unity and ethnic solidarity, or "demanding independence"?

The so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" states: "The Tibetan people have always had a strong desire for independence." This has nothing in common with the Dalai Lama's consistent emphasis on national unity and ethnic solidarity.

In his report at the founding meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region on April 24, 1956, the Dalai Lama stated: "The achievements we have made in all aspects of our work in the years since the peaceful liberation are remarkable and multifaceted, too numerous to mention individually. All the above-mentioned work we have done, as well as many other tasks, have been carried out under the general principles of constantly opposing imperialist instigation and sabotage, strengthening patriotic ideology, consolidating unity among and within ethnic groups, and consolidating the unity of the motherland. As a result of practical education and continuous learning in various tasks, people and officials of all strata in Tibet have clearly recognized from practice that only by being constantly vigilant and opposing imperialist instigation and sabotage conspiracies, striving to enhance patriotic ideology, and truly strengthening and consolidating the unity of the motherland and ethnic solidarity, as well as strengthening internal unity and solidarity within Tibet, can we truly do all tasks well, seek progress and development, and build a prosperous and happy new Tibet on the general road of building a socialist motherland."

In his article "Further Strengthen the Anti-Imperialist Patriotic United Front and Strive to Build a Prosperous and Happy New Tibet," published in the "People's Daily" on National Day in 1958, the Dalai Lama stated: "The Tibetan ethnic group in Tibet is one of the ethnic groups with a long history within China. Since the Tibetan people returned to the great family of the motherland, they have fully enjoyed the rights of freedom and equality along with other fraternal ethnic groups. The bright and happy socialist general line, which conforms to the vital interests of the 600 million people of China, including the Tibetan people, is the broad road before our Tibetan people, and there is no other road besides this." He continued: "In the future, all of us monks and laypeople must further strengthen the anti-imperialist patriotic united front, and on this basis, use practical actions of continuously strengthening unity and progress to oppose and counter various conspiracies of internal and external reactionary elements to undermine the unification of the motherland and ethnic solidarity, and work together to build a socialist new Tibet."

On February 16, 1953, on the preaching platform east of the Jokhang Temple, the Dalai Lama preached to the monks and laypeople of the city, saying: "According to classical records and historical facts, the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups have always been inseparable brothers, and their relations in culture, economy, and religion have been very close. In the future, the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups should be even more united."

On the eve of the New Year in 1959, the Dalai Lama met with reporters from the "Tibet Daily" and gave a speech saying: "1959 is the tenth year of our country's founding and the eighth year after the peaceful liberation of Tibet. In this year, I hope that all the Tibetan people will draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, distinguish between right and wrong, and not be confused by the enemy's instigation and sowing of discord. We must resolutely and thoroughly oppose internal and external enemies and love the motherland." He said: "Our motherland is a socialist country. People's communes have been established in the interior of the motherland, which are the seedlings of communism. The society of our Tibet is still far behind the interior, and we Tibetan people must do our best to catch up with the interior in the shortest possible time and reach the level of the interior."

III. Is it ethnic unity and equality, or ethnic oppression?

The so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" states that after the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, "the Tibetan government did not enjoy any degree of autonomy, even in internal matters, and the Chinese government exercised full authority over Tibetan affairs." However, the Dalai Lama previously believed that liberated China abolished the policy of national oppression and implemented a policy of national unity and equality.

On November 19, 1951, at a banquet in the Norbulingka Park, the Dalai Lama delivered a welcoming speech to the staff sent by the Central People's Government to Tibet and the responsible cadres of the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet, saying: "Many facts prove that you value the interests of the Tibetan people more than your own lives, and you also respect me, the Dalai Lama, and all Living Buddhas very much. Not only are all the monk and lay officials very happy about this, but I, the Dalai Lama, am also very happy."

On March 9, 1955, the Dalai Lama spoke at the seventh meeting of the plenary session of the State Council, saying: "In the process of helping Tibet carry out various constructions and tasks in the past three years and more, the People's Liberation Army and staff working in Tibet, according to Chairman Mao's great policy of national unity and equality, have consulted with Tibetan monk and lay staff and people on all matters, large and small, and gradually implemented them according to their wishes. On the basis of thus benefiting Tibet and gaining trust, the old influence of the past discord between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups has been gradually eliminated, giving me great encouragement."

On December 22, 1954, the Dalai Lama said at the first plenary session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Because the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet and the staff working in Tibet correctly implemented the national policy, the Tibetan people have increasingly deeply felt the warmth of the great family of the motherland and seen the bright future for them, so the patriotism of the Tibetan people has grown day by day, and they wholeheartedly support the unification of the motherland."

On April 24, 1956, the Dalai Lama said in his report at the founding meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region: "Since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the announcement of the Central People's Government in 1949, the Central People's Government, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, has completely abolished the policy of national oppression, announced that all ethnic groups within the People's Republic of China are equal, and implemented unity and mutual assistance, opposing imperialism and the people's enemies within all ethnic groups, making the People's Republic of China a great family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups." He also said: "For the past five years, the People's Liberation Army and staff working in Tibet have conscientiously observed and implemented the Chinese Communist Party's and Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, treating the Tibetan people with brotherly affection, listening to the people's opinions, thinking of the people's interests everywhere, and fully consulting with the leaders of the Tibetan local government on all matters."

IV. Is religious belief respected and protected, or is it interference with religious freedom?

The so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" fabricates that "many lamas were killed, a large number of monks and officials were arrested and taken to China to build roads, and interference with the exercise of religious freedom increased." However, the Dalai Lama himself has said that he personally experienced that there is freedom of religious belief.

On September 16, 1954, the Dalai Lama said at the first meeting of the First National People's Congress: "Among the various provocations of the enemy, the main one is to spread rumors that the Communist Party and the People's Government are destroying religion. The Tibetan people have a very strong religious belief, and these rumors once made them feel apprehensive, but now the provocative rumors of 'the Communist Party and the People's Government destroying religion' have all gone bankrupt, and the Tibetan people have personally realized that they have freedom of religious belief."

In his telegram to Chairman Mao on June 29, 1953, congratulating the birthday of the Communist Party of China, the Dalai Lama said: "I feel very excited and at ease that the Chinese Buddhist Association has been established in the capital, Beijing. Monks studying the Dharma, headed by the three major monasteries, and many men and women compatriots, can all believe in Buddhism and chant scriptures according to their own wishes, and all the monks and laypeople in Tibet have unprecedentedly satisfied their wishes. All these benefits are due to the fact that the Tibetan people have broken away from the shackles of imperialism and returned to the great family of the motherland."

On May 23, 1955, the Dalai Lama also stated in his article celebrating the fourth anniversary of the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet that in the four years since the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, "the religious beliefs of the Tibetan people have been strictly protected; the customs and habits of the Tibetan people have been seriously respected."

On June 29, 1955, the Dalai Lama talked about what he saw and heard during his visits to various parts of the motherland at a welcome meeting in Lhasa: "When we visited major cities in the motherland... we saw that all temples were protected, and all male and female believers fully and freely believed in various religions without any restrictions. All religions and sects throughout the country were not only not damaged in the slightest, but also received respect and protection, specifically realizing the provisions on freedom of religious belief in Article 88 of the Constitution."

On April 24, 1956, the Dalai Lama also talked about the issue of freedom of religious belief at the founding meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, saying: "In the past few years, because the People's Liberation Army and staff working in Tibet have strictly observed the policy of freedom of religious belief, conscientiously protected Lama temples, and respected the beliefs of the Tibetan people, while also distributing alms to the vast number of monks every year and taking other practical actions, the doubts and fears caused by the rumors and provocations of imperialist agents among the broad masses of the people, especially the monks and lamas, have been greatly dispelled."

V. Does the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region "have no power"?

The so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" says: The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region established in 1956 "had no power" and "decisions on all important issues were made by the Chinese authorities." Below, we will see how the Dalai Lama viewed the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

On April 22, 1956, the Dalai Lama said in his opening speech at the founding meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region: "The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region marks that the work in the Tibet region has entered a new stage. In the future, Tibet will be more united and progressive, realize a unified autonomous region, and, in combination with the specific situation of Tibet and the will and wishes of the leaders and the broad masses of the people of Tibet, gradually carry out democratic reform and social reform."

The Dalai Lama also gave a speech at the founding meeting, saying: "Judging from the current situation, the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is not only timely, but also necessary." He went on to say: "Recently, news of reforms being carried out or prepared to be carried out in neighboring provinces in a peaceful and negotiated manner has spread to Tibet, causing doubts and fears among some people. At the same time, some people with ulterior motives say that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, Tibet will undergo reforms, which is completely malicious rumor-mongering and provocation. Therefore, I would like to express my opinion on this issue: Our motherland is now vigorously carrying out socialist construction, and all fraternal ethnic groups across the country are advancing on the road to socialism. So-called socialism is a truly happy and fulfilling society. Tibet has no other road than to take the road of socialism. However, socialism is far from the existing specific situation in Tibet. We must gradually carry out reforms. But when to reform? How to reform? This depends on the development of work and the specific situation in all aspects. At the same time, it is up to the leaders of Tibet and the broad masses of the people to discuss and carry out the reforms themselves, rather than being forced or monopolized by others. This point has been clearly instructed by Chairman Mao in his talks to the successive congratulatory delegations and visiting delegations. In 1954, when I and Panchen Erdeni went to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao repeatedly instructed us that reforms must come slowly and cannot be impatient. At the same time, he also clearly told Sokang Wangqing Gele (Kalon of the Tibetan local government) and Lhalu Tsewang Dorje (head of the 1955 Tibet visiting delegation) and others that reforms are meant to improve everyone's lives, not to make them worse. Therefore, there is no need to worry or fear reforms, and there is no need to think too much about them. What we should consider first now is how to unite as one, actively strive to do a good job in the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and continuously promote the work in Tibet forward, so that reforms can be carried out from top to bottom through peaceful consultations at an appropriate time."

On October 1, 1957, the Dalai Lama stated in his article "The Tibetan People Strive to Strengthen Patriotism - Unity - Progress on the Existing Basis" published in the "People's Daily": "Last year, the unified Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, including the Tibetan local government, the Panchen Kampotse Conference Hall, and the Qamdo area, was established, thereby laying a new foundation for the Tibetan people to fully enjoy the rights of being masters of their own affairs. Thanks to the active efforts of Tibetan and Han staff, the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has also achieved certain results." He continued: "The fundamental way for ethnic development lies in reform and in taking the socialist road. The Central Government has decided that no reforms will be carried out in Tibet during the second five-year plan period, which is a completely correct policy that conforms to the current specific situation in Tibet. ... On the existing basis, the Tibetan people must actively strive to strengthen patriotism, unity, and progress. The agencies under the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region had the disadvantage of being too large and have completed the work of streamlining and reorganization. Now only a very small number of Han cadres who are helping with the work have been retained, and the rest are mostly Tibetan cadres. In the future, monk and lay staff in various new and old institutions should unite with Han staff and establish close ties with monk and lay people to jointly create various conditions and actively strive to build a new Tibet with the flourishing of politics and religion and complete happiness."

    孰真孰伪　对照自明
    ——达赖喇嘛重要言论的辑录
    编者按　4月18日在提斯浦尔经由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，不仅引起我国各族人民一致的谴责，就在国外舆论界，也有不少人指出所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”漏洞很多，并怀疑它究竟是否达赖本人的声明。在最近的全国人民代表大会的讲台上，代表们都指出这个声明同达赖喇嘛平时的言行，毫无共同之处，完全是别人强加在达赖喇嘛身上的。下面辑录了解放以来达赖喇嘛的重要言论，并且同所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”相对照。孰真孰伪，读者从这里可以作出自己的判断。
    一、和平解放西藏的协议是在“压力下”达成的吗？
    所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中说：“1951年，在中国政府的压力下，达成了中国和西藏之间的十七条协议”。而达赖喇嘛过去却认为这个协议是“在团结友爱的基础上”签订的；并且认为这个协议使西藏人民“开始走上了自由幸福的光明大道”。
    1951年10月24日达赖喇嘛致电毛主席表示拥护和平解放西藏的协议，他在电文中说：“今年西藏地方政府，特派全权代表噶伦阿沛等五人，于1951年4月抵达北京，与中央人民政府指定的全权代表进行和谈。双方代表在友好基础上，已于1951年5月23日签订了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。西藏地方政府及藏族僧、俗人民一致拥护，并在毛主席及中央人民政府领导下，积极协助人民解放军进藏部队，巩固国防，驱逐帝国主义势力出西藏，保护祖国领土主权的统一”。
    1956年4月24日在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上达赖喇嘛的报告说：“1951年我派代表到北京与中央人民政府代表进行谈判，在团结友爱的基础上，签订了中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。从此，西藏人民永远摆脱了帝国主义的奴役和羁绊，回到了祖国大家庭，和祖国各兄弟民族人民一样，充分享受到了民族平等的一切权利，开始走上了自由幸福的光明大道，在建设社会主义祖国的总道路上，建设着自己的繁荣幸福的生活。”他还说：“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，是根据中国共产党的民族平等政策和西藏当时的具体情况和要求而制定的，它完全符合于西藏人民和祖国各族人民的利益，它给西藏人民指出了争取解放的道路，是我们这一时期的行动纲领；认真执行协议的各项规定，是我们神圣的光荣的任务。”
    1958年5月23日西藏和平解放七周年纪念日，达赖喇嘛给毛主席和国务院的致敬电也说，七年来，“进藏的人民解放军和工作人员以及西藏的僧俗人民积极执行了协议十七条”。
    二、赞成祖国统一和民族团结，还是“要求独立”？
    所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中说：“西藏人一向有一种要求独立的强烈愿望”。这同达赖喇嘛一贯重视祖国统一和民族团结是毫无共同之处。
    1956年4月24日在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上，达赖喇嘛报告称：“和平解放后几年来，我们在各方面的工作中所取得的成就是显著的，多方面的，不能逐件数尽。我们所做的上述各项工作以及其他许多工作，都是在不断反对帝国主义的挑拨破坏，加强爱国主义思想，巩固民族间和民族内部的团结，巩固祖国的统一的总方针下进行的。而由于各项工作的实际教育和不断学习的结果，西藏各阶层人民和官员从实践中明确认识到只有时时刻刻警惕和反对帝国主义的挑拨破坏阴谋，努力提高爱国主义思想，确实加强和巩固祖国的统一和民族团结，加强西藏内部的统一和团结，才能真正做好各项工作，求得进步和发展，才能在建设社会主义祖国的总道路上建设起繁荣幸福的新西藏。”
    1958年国庆节达赖喇嘛在“人民日报”上发表“进一步加强反帝爱国统一战线为建设繁荣幸福的新西藏而努力”一文中称：“西藏藏族是中国境内具有悠久历史的民族之一。西藏人民回到祖国大家庭以来，和其他兄弟民族一起，充分享受了自由平等的权利。符合包括西藏人民在内的中国六亿人民切身利益的光明幸福的社会主义总路线，是我们西藏人民面前的康庄大道，除此而外，其他的道路是没有的”。他继续写道：“今后，我们全体僧俗人民要进一步加强反帝爱国统一战线，并在此基础上以不断加强团结进步的实际行动来反对和回击内外反动分子的破坏祖国统一和民族团结的各种阴谋活动，为建设社会主义新西藏而共同努力。”
    1953年2月16日达赖喇嘛在大昭寺东面的讲经台上向全市僧俗人民讲经时说：“根据经典记载和历史事实，汉藏民族历来就是分不开的亲兄弟，无论在文化上、经济上和宗教上的关系都很密切，今后汉藏民族应当更加团结。”
    1959年新年前夕，达赖喇嘛接见“西藏日报”记者，发表谈话说：“1959年是我国建国的第十年，也是西藏和平解放后的第八年。在这一年里，我希望全体西藏人民要划清敌我界线、分清是非，不要被敌人的挑拨、离间所迷惑，坚决、彻底地反对内外敌人，要热爱祖国。”他说：“我们的祖国是社会主义国家。祖国内地已成立了人民公社，这是共产主义的幼苗。而我们西藏的社会，与内地还相差很远，我们西藏人民要尽最大的力量，争取在尽可能短的时间里赶上内地，达到内地的水平。”
    三、是民族团结和平等，还是民族压迫？
    在所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中谈到中国人民解放军进驻西藏后“西藏政府没有享受任何程度的自治，甚至在内部问题上也是这样，而中国政府对西藏的事务行使全权”。但是达赖喇嘛过去却认为解放了的中国废除了民族压迫政策，实行了民族团结平等的政策。
    1951年11月19日，达赖喇嘛在拉藏孜付林卡（公园）欢宴中央人民政府派赴西藏的工作人员和人民解放军进藏部队的负责干部时致欢迎词说：“许多事实证明：你们把西藏人民的利益看得比自己的生命还要重要，对我达赖喇嘛及所有活佛也很尊重。这点不仅全体僧俗官员都很高兴，我达赖喇嘛也非常高兴。”
    1955年3月9日，达赖喇嘛在国务院全体会议第七次会议上讲话说：“在过去三年多的时间中，进藏人民解放军和工作人员在帮助西藏进行各项建设和工作的过程中，根据毛主席的伟大的民族团结平等政策，所有一切大小事宜都同西藏僧俗工作人员和人民进行协商，根据他们的意愿逐步予以实施。在这样对西藏谋福利从而取得信任的基础上，逐步消除了过去遗留下来的汉藏民族间的隔阂的旧影响，给我以极大的鼓舞”。
    1954年12月22日达赖喇嘛在政协第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议上发言说：“由于中国人民解放军进藏部队和进藏工作人员正确地执行了民族政策，使西藏人民日益深刻地感受到祖国大家庭的温暖，和看到他们未来的光明前途，因而西藏人民的爱国主义精神日益增长起来，衷心拥护祖国的统一”。
    1956年4月24日，达赖喇嘛在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上作报告时说：“自从1946年中华人民共和国和中央人民政府宣布成立以后，中央人民政府依据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的规定，彻底废除了民族压迫政策，宣布中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌，使中华人民共和国成为各族人民友爱合作的大家庭”。他还说：“五年来，进藏人民解放军和工作人员认真地遵守和执行了中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策，用兄弟般的情感对待藏族人民，倾听人民的意见，处处为人民的利益着想，遇事和西藏地方的领导人员充分协商。”
    四、是宗教信仰受到尊重和保护，还是干涉宗教自由？
    所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”捏造说：“许多喇嘛被杀，大批僧人和官员被抓去在中国筑路，对行使宗教自由权的干涉增加了。”但是达赖喇嘛自己说过，他亲身体会到宗教信仰上是自由的。
    1954年9月16日，达赖喇嘛在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上发言说：“在敌人的各种挑拨离间中，主要的一项，就是造谣共产党、人民政府毁灭宗教。西藏人民具有很浓厚的宗教信仰，这些谣言，曾经使他们疑虑不安，但是现在‘共产党、人民政府毁灭宗教’的挑拨离间的谣言，已经全部破产了，西藏人民已经切身地体会到了他们在宗教信仰上是有自由的。”
    1953年6月29日，达赖致电毛主席祝贺中国共产党生日的电文中谈到：“在首都北京成立了中国佛教协会，我感到非常兴奋和安心。以三大寺为首的学法僧侣和许多男女同胞，都得按其自己的意愿信佛念经，西藏全体僧俗人民都空前未有地满足了自己的愿望。所有这些好处，是由于西藏人民脱离了帝国主义的羁绊，回到了祖国大家庭中。”
    1955年5月23日，达赖喇嘛在庆祝西藏和平解放四周年的文章中也说到，西藏和平解放四年来，“西藏人民的宗教信仰受到严格的保护；西藏人民的风俗习惯受到认真的尊重”。
    1955年6月29日，达赖喇嘛在拉萨各界欢迎会上谈到他自己在祖国各地参观访问的所闻所见说：“我们到祖国各大城市参观时，……看到所有的寺庙都受到了保护，所有男女信徒，充分自由的信仰各种宗教，不受任何限制，全国各地所有的宗教和教派，不但没有受到丝毫的破坏，而且得到了尊重和保护，具体的实现了宪法第八十八条中宗教信仰自由的规定”。
    1956年4月24日，达赖喇嘛在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上也谈到了关于宗教信仰自由的问题，他说：“几年来，由于进藏人民解放军和工作人员严格遵守了宗教信仰自由政策，认真地保护了喇嘛寺庙，尊重藏族人民的信仰，同时每年向广大僧徒发放布施等实际行动，大大地打消了由于帝国主义特务分子造谣挑拨而在广大人民群众特别是喇嘛僧众中引起的疑惧心情。”
    五、西藏自治区筹备委员会“没有什么权力”吗？
    所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”说：1956年成立的西藏自治区筹备委员会“没有什么权力”、“关于一切重要问题的决定都是由中国当局作出的”。下面就将看到达赖喇嘛是怎样看西藏自治区筹备委员会的。
    1956年4月22日，达赖喇嘛在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上所作的开幕词中说：“西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，标志着西藏地区的工作已进入一个新的阶段。今后，西藏将更加团结进步，实现统一的自治区，并结合西藏的具体情况和西藏领导人员及广大人民的意志和愿望，逐步地进行民主改革和社会改革。”
    达赖喇嘛在成立大会上还发表讲话说：“从现在情况看来，西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，不仅是适时的，而且是必要的。”他接着说：“最近邻居各省用和平协商的方式，正在进行或准备进行改革的消息传到了西藏，引起了若干人的疑虑和惧怕。同时有些人别有用心的说西藏自治区筹备委员会成立后，西藏就要进行改革，这完全是一种恶意造谣和挑拨。因此我想就这个问题谈一点意见：现在我们的祖国正在轰轰烈烈地进行着社会主义建设，全国各兄弟民族正在走向社会主义的康庄大道上前进着。所谓社会主义，是真正幸福美满的社会，西藏除了走社会主义的道路以外，别无其他道路，但是，社会主义和西藏现有的具体情况相距很远，我们必须逐步进行改革，但什么时候改革？如何改革？这还得看工作发展和各方面的具体情况，同时是要西藏的领导人员和广大人民自己商量去进行，而不是由别人强迫包办。这点在毛主席对历次致敬团、参观团的谈话中均有明确的指示。1954年我和班禅额尔德尼去北京拜见毛主席时，毛主席再三叮嘱我们改革必须慢慢地来，不能性急，同时还明确告诉过索康·旺清格勒（西藏地方政府噶伦）以及去年参观团的拉鲁·策旺多吉（1955年西藏参观团团长）等人，改革是要把大家的生活改好，而不是改坏。所以，对于改革的顾虑和惧怕是不必要的，也用不着过多的去考虑。我们现在应该首先考虑的还是如何团结一致，积极努力把西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作做好，把西藏的工作不断的向前推进，以便在适当的时机通过和平协商的方式，自上而下的进行改革。”
    1957年10月1日，达赖喇嘛在“人民日报”发表“西藏人民在已有的基础上努力加强爱国——团结——进步”一文中称：“去年成立了包括西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅、昌都地区三方面的统一的西藏自治区筹备委员会，从而奠定了藏族充分享受当家作主权利的新基础。由于藏汉工作人员积极努力，西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作也获得了一定成绩。”他接着写道：“民族发展的根本在于改革，在于走社会主义道路。中央已决定第二个五年计划期间内在西藏不进行改革，这是完全符合西藏当前具体情况的正确方针。……西藏人民在已有的基础上，必须积极努力加强爱国、团结、进步。西藏自治区筹备委员会所属机构因有太庞大的缺点，已完成了精简整编的工作，现在只保留了进行帮助工作的极少数汉族干部，其余大部分完全是藏族干部。今后，各新、旧机构中的僧俗工作人员，都应该与汉族工作人员团结一致，并切实与僧俗人民取得亲密联系，共同创造各种条件，为建设一个政教昌隆、圆满幸福的新西藏而积极努力。”
