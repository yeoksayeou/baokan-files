Xinhua News Agency, April 15th. The newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, Tran Tu Binh, along with all the diplomats of the embassy, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong this afternoon.

Present at the ceremony were Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, Deputy Director of the Second Asian Department of the Foreign Ministry Li Qiangfen, and Protocol Department Commissioner Han Xu.

During the presentation of credentials, Ambassador Tran Tu Binh delivered a eulogy.

On behalf of the President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people, he extended the most friendly and warm respects to Chairman Mao Zedong and the fraternal Chinese people. He said: “Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People’s Republic of China, the heroic Chinese people have made extremely great achievements in the cause of socialist construction. The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the development in culture, education, science, and technology have improved the lives of the 650 million Chinese people. The Vietnamese people are very excited to see these victories and regard them as their own.”

Ambassador Tran Tu Binh said: “The People’s Republic of China has made tremendous contributions to the fraternal unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The People’s Republic of China is also one of the countries standing at the forefront of supporting the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their movements against colonialism and for national independence, and tirelessly and resolutely fighting to defend world peace. Therefore, the international prestige of the People’s Republic of China is increasing day by day.”

He said: “In the past national liberation struggle and in today’s cause of socialist construction in North Vietnam and the struggle for national reunification, the Vietnamese people have always received sincere support from the Chinese people. The Vietnamese people would like to express their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China, and firmly believe that the long-standing friendly relations between the Vietnamese and Chinese people will be increasingly consolidated and developed through political, economic, and cultural cooperation.”

Chairman Mao Zedong said in reply: “Since the restoration of peace in Vietnam, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, have achieved great successes in the restoration and development of the national economy and in other fields. The Chinese people are extremely pleased with all these achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

“The Vietnamese people are very eager for the reunification of their motherland. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been making unremitting efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland. I firmly believe that the legitimate desire of the Vietnamese people to unify their motherland will surely be realized.

“The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a member of the socialist camp family. It has consistently made great efforts to continuously consolidate the close unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, and has made significant contributions to maintaining and thoroughly implementing the Geneva Accords and to safeguarding peace in the Indochina region and the world.

“In recent years, the Chinese and Vietnamese people have supported each other and cooperated closely in the cause of striving for peace and building socialism, fully demonstrating the fraternal unity and unbreakable friendship between socialist countries. The Chinese people greatly cherish the friendship with the Vietnamese people and will continue to do everything possible to strengthen and develop the friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries.”
