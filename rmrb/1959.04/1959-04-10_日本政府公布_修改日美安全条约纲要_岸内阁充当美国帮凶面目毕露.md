Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party announced the "Outline for Revising the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" on the 8th. This outline clearly demonstrates that the Nobusuke Kishi group is willing to sell out Japan's sovereignty and national interests according to U.S. demands, attempting to further drag Japan into the U.S. military aggression system through the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and serve as an accomplice to U.S. aggression in Asia.

Ignoring the Japanese people's demand for the abolition of the "Security Treaty," the outline states: Japan must "continue to maintain" the "security guarantee system" between Japan and the United States based on the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The Nobusuke Kishi group also stated in the outline: It is necessary to clearly stipulate that the United States has the obligation to "defend" Japan, and at the same time, Japan must "complete the tasks that should be completed within the scope allowed by national power and the Constitution."

The outline stipulates that U.S. forces "can use Japanese facilities and areas."

In the outline, the Nobusuke Kishi group attempts to use deceptive tactics to include Okinawa Island in the "common defense area" with the United States, so as to use this strategic island in the Pacific as a base to organize a Northeast Asian aggression group. The outline states: The treaty area should be stipulated as the entire territory of Japan. However, areas where Japan does not currently exercise administrative power (i.e., Okinawa Island and the Ogasawara Islands) are "temporarily not included in the treaty area," and will be "automatically included in the treaty area" after Japan regains administrative power in the future.

The outline also states that regarding the equipment and deployment of U.S. forces and the use of Japanese facilities and areas by U.S. forces for operations outside Japan, it is necessary to "consult with the Japanese government in advance." The Japanese public has long pointed out that this "consultation" is merely a disguise to make Japan undertake more military obligations.

Like the existing "Security Treaty," the outline indicates that U.S. forces can interfere in Japan's internal affairs and suppress the Japanese people's movement according to the Japanese government's request. The outline says that if Japan is subjected to "indirect aggression" and this "aggression" threatens Japan's security, Japan should consult with the United States to take "necessary measures."

The outline also shows that the Nobusuke Kishi group not only attempts to strengthen military collusion with the United States by revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," but also attempts to strengthen its dependence on the United States in political, economic, and other aspects. The outline states: It is necessary to clearly stipulate the "cooperative" relationship between Japan and the United States in various aspects such as politics, economy, and "security guarantee," and the "security guarantee" relationship can only "exist as a part of a broader political and economic relationship."

According to this outline, the effective period of the new "Security Treaty" is ten years.

The Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party also issued an "Outline for Adjusting the Administrative Agreement" today, preparing to sign a new "Administrative Agreement" at the same time as signing the new "Security Treaty." This outline shows that the new "Administrative Agreement" will continue to grant privileges to U.S. forces stationed in Japan. The outline says, "In view of the fact that the new treaty stipulates that U.S. forces shall undertake the obligation to defend Japan, it is necessary to consider preventing obstacles to the completion of this mission."

### 日本政府公布“修改日美安全条约纲要”  岸内阁充当美国帮凶面目毕露

    日本政府公布“修改日美安全条约纲要”
    岸内阁充当美国帮凶面目毕露
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本政府和自由民主党8日发表了
  “修改日美安全条约纲要”。这个纲要清楚地表明，岸信介集团甘心根据美国要求出卖日本主权和民族利益，企图通过修改日美“安全条约”，进一步把日本拖入美国的军事侵略体系，并且充当美国侵略亚洲的帮凶。
    不顾日本人民关于废除“安全条约”的要求，纲要写道：日本要“继续保持”以日美“安全条约”为基础的日美两国间的“安全保障体制”。
    岸信介集团在纲要中还说：要明确规定美国有“保卫”日本的义务，同时日本也要根据“国家力量和宪法允许的范围内完成应当完成的任务”。
    纲要规定，美军“可以使用日本的设施和区域”。
    在纲要中，岸信介集团企图要弄欺骗手法把冲绳岛划入同美国的“共同防御地区”，以便以这个太平洋上的战略岛屿为据点，组织东北亚侵略集团。纲要写道：要规定条约地区是整个日本领土。不过，目前不是由日本行使行政权的地区（即冲绳岛和小笠原群岛），“暂时不包括在条约地区以内”，将来日本收回行政权以后再“自动地划入条约地区”。
    纲要还写道，关于美军的装备和部署以及美军为了在日本以外地区作战而使用日本的设施和区域时，要“事先同日本政府协商”。日本公众早已指出，这种“协商”只是将使日本承担更多的军事义务的外衣。
    和现行的“安全条约”一样，纲要中表明美军可以根据日本政府的要求，干涉日本内政，镇压日本人民运动。纲要说，如果日本受到“间接侵略”，并且这种“侵略”威胁到日本的安全，日本就要同美国协商，以便采取“必要的措施”。
    纲要还表明岸信介集团不仅企图通过修改日美“安全条约”来加强同美国的军事勾结，而且还企图在政治、经济等方面加强对美国的依赖关系。纲要说：要明确规定日美两国在政治、经济、“安全保障”等各方面的“合作”关系，而“安全保障”关系只能“作为更加广泛的政治和经济关系的一环而存在”。
    根据这个纲要，新的“安全条约”的有效期间是十年。
    岸信介政府和自由民主党今天还发表了“调整行政协定纲要”，准备在签订新的“安全条约”的同时将签订新的“行政协定”。这个纲要表明新的“行政协定”将继续给予驻日美军以特权。纲要说，“鉴于新条约规定美军要承担保卫日本的义务的情况，要考虑防止对完成这个使命发生障碍的情况。”
