Xinhua News Agency report, Tokyo: The National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," composed of more than 140 Japanese organizations, held an executive meeting on the evening of the 6th and adopted a national action plan to hold a "Unified Action Day for All People to Abolish the Security Treaty and Prevent its Revision" on the 15th.

The action plan stipulates that prefectural, regional, and workplace rallies will be held simultaneously throughout the country on that day.

The plan stipulates that workers, students, and citizens in Tokyo will collectively petition Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi on the afternoon of that day; and a "Central Rally to Support the Verdict in the Sunagawa Case and Crush the Security Treaty System" will be held in the evening.

In addition, members of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will ride in one hundred trucks, holding placards with slogans such as "Support the Verdict in the Sunagawa Case, Safeguard the Constitution," and hold a large-scale demonstration march in the city.

At a meeting held on the 6th, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has more than three million members, and the Neutral Trade Union decided that Japanese workers would launch the sixth national unified action of the spring struggle on the 15th, focusing on demands for the abolition of the "Security Treaty" and the victory of elections.

At the same time, news indicates that the Japanese movement against revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is developing deeply into various prefectures.

According to a report in the "Akahata" on the 7th, people from all walks of life in Mie Prefecture, Japan, established the "Mie Prefecture Prefectural People's Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" on the 3rd. Twenty-seven organizations participated in this joint struggle organization, including local organizations of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.

As previously reported, similar joint struggle organizations have also been established in Hyogo Prefecture and Hokkaido, Japan.

According to "Akahata," the Hiroshima Prefectural Branch of the All Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union decided at a committee meeting held on March 29th and 30th that they would do their utmost to fight to prevent revision and strive for the abolition of the "Security Treaty."

The movement guidelines determined by this trade union stipulate that they should also strive to promote the establishment of joint struggle conferences for the abolition of the "Security Treaty" in Hiroshima Prefecture and various regional units, and through this activity promote the establishment of a united front between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: Okada Munekatsu, Director of the International Bureau of the Socialist Party of Japan, issued a statement today strongly opposing the outline for revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" drafted by the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

Okada pointed out that this outline is a product of the United States' strategic needs to oppose the socialist camp. It does not change the basic nature of the "Security Treaty," and in fact cannot make Japan equal; on the contrary, it will strengthen Japan's military "cooperation" with the United States and pave the way for the United States to interfere in Japan's internal affairs.

Okada said that the outline of the Nobusuke Kishi group stipulates that Okinawa Island and the Ogasawara Islands will be included in the "Treaty Applicable Areas" in the future. In this way, when taking joint military actions based on the military treaties concluded by the United States with the Chiang Kai-shek group, the Syngman Rhee group, and the Philippines, Japan is in danger of being dragged into war, because the applicable areas of these military treaties all include these islands.

Okada also pointed out that the outline stipulates that "prior consultations" should be conducted between the two sides regarding the transfer and equipment of U.S. troops stationed in Japan. This may lead to the result of Japan granting the United States the right to transport nuclear weapons into Japan and making Japan actively participate in U.S. military operations. (Photo attached)

The Japanese people are actively preparing for the "Unified Action Day" to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" by the people of the whole country to be held on April 15.

    日本人民反对“安全条约”斗争深入扩展
    全国各地将在月中举行全民一致行动日
    日社会党国际局长强烈谴责岸内阁修改“安全条约”纲要
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯，东京消息：日本一百四十多个团体组成的阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议6日晚上举行干事会议，通过了在15日举行“为废除安全条约和阻止修改安全条约全体人民统一行动日”的全国行动计划。
    行动计划规定，当天将在全国各地同时举行县民大会、地区大会和工作场所大会。
    计划规定，东京的工人、学生和市民在当天下午将对日本首相岸信介举行集体请愿；晚上将举行“支持砂川事件的判决、粉碎安全条约体系中央集会”。
    此外，日本工会总评议会的会员们将乘坐一百辆卡车，高举写着“支持砂川事件的判决、维护宪法”的标语牌，在市内举行大规模的示威游行。
    拥有三百多万会员的日本工会总评议会和中立性工会在6日举行的会议上决定，日本工人将以争取废除“安全条约”和争取选举胜利为中心要求，在15日展开春季斗争的第六次全国统一行动。
    与此同时，消息表明，日本反对修改日美“安全条约”运动正在向各县深入发展。
    据“赤旗报”7日报道，日本三重县各界人民在3日成立了“三重县县民阻止修改安全条约会议”。参加这个联合斗争组织的有二十七个团体，其中包括社会党和共产党的地方组织。
    前已报道，日本兵库县和北海道也成立了同样的联合斗争组织。
    据“赤旗报”报道，全国电气通信工会广岛县分会曾经在3月29日和30日两天举行的委员会会议上决定，它们将竭力为阻止修改和争取废除“安全条约”而斗争。
    这个工会决定的运动方针规定，它们还要努力促使在广岛县和各地区单位成立为争取废除“安全条约”的共同斗争会议，并且通过这种活动促使建立社会党和共产党的联合战线。
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本社会党国际局长冈田宗司今天发表谈话，强烈反对岸信介政府和执政党自由民主党拟出的修改日美“安全条约”的纲要。
    冈田指出，这个纲要是美国反对社会主义阵营的战略需要的产物。它并不改变“安全条约”的基本性质，事实上不能使日本得到平等，相反地将加强日本同美国的军事“合作”，并且为美国干涉日本内政开辟了道路。
    冈田说，岸信介集团的纲要规定将来要把冲绳岛和小笠原群岛划入“条约适用地区”。这样，在根据美国同蒋介石集团、李承晚集团和菲律宾缔结的军事条约而采取联合军事行动时，日本就有被卷入战争的危险。因为这些军事条约的适用区域都包括这些岛屿。
    冈田还指出，纲要规定对于驻日美军的调动和装备双方要进行“事前协商”。这可能造成这样的结果：使日本给予美国把核武器运进日本的权利，并且使日本积极参加美军的作战行动。（附图片）
    日本人民正在积极准备将在4月15日举行的全国人民阻止修改日美“安全条约”“统一行动日”。这是在东京街头展开反对日美“安全条约”的签名运动情形。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　新华社稿
