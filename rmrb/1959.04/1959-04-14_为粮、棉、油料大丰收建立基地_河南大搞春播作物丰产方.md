To Establish Bases for a Bumper Harvest of Grain, Cotton, and Oil Crops
Henan Goes All Out for High-Yield Plans for Spring-Sown Crops

　　(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 13th dispatch) Henan Province is vigorously promoting garden-style farming and high-yield plots in spring plowing and sowing, establishing high-yield bases to strive for a bumper harvest of grain, cotton, and oil crops.

　　Based on last year's bumper harvest, the production increase targets set by various regions in Henan Province this year have doubled compared to last year. In order to ensure an even greater harvest of grain, cotton, and oil throughout the year, drawing on the measures taken for wheat high-yield plots this year, it is necessary to universally achieve garden-style farming in spring-sown crops, vigorously promote high-yield plots, and establish high-yield bases. The province requires that the area of high-yield plots for various spring-sown crops should generally account for 30% to 40%, and the yield of high-yield plots should exceed that of ordinary fields by more than double.

　　Xinxiang Prefecture, known as the "Henan Cotton Granary," has already deep-plowed and leveled all four million mu of cotton fields in the area. In order to strive for a high-yield bumper harvest of cotton, the area has planned six high-yield plots, covering an area of one million mu. The prefectural party committee and administrative office have established a joint command for cotton high-yield plots to strengthen leadership over the high-yield plots. Anyang County, which has the most cotton in this area, will plant 720,000 mu of cotton this year, striving to become a county with a yield of 500 jin of ginned cotton per mu. To ensure the realization of this plan, the county is carrying out 400,000 mu of large-area high-yield plots, comprehensively realizing three transformations along with the planning of high-yield plots: garden-style farming in the plains, drainage ditch and platform field transformation in low-lying areas, and terraced field transformation in mountainous and hilly areas. Furthermore, a large-scale high-yield movement is being carried out throughout the county. Xuchang Prefecture, where tobacco acreage accounts for more than 77% of the province's acreage, is also determined to transform all 1.2 million mu of tobacco fields in the prefecture into advanced garden-style fields. More than 640,000 mu of the 800,000 mu of early tobacco fields have already reached this standard.

　　In the spring-sown grain and oil crops, the realization of garden-style farming and high-yield plots is also regarded as the main measure to ensure a bumper harvest. Kaifeng Prefecture has planned twelve large-area high-yield rice areas, seven high-yield sweet potato areas, five high-yield peanut areas, and three high-yield soybean areas, covering a total area of more than 3 million mu. A high tide of spring plowing and sowing, centered on high-yield plots, has formed throughout the area.

　　In order to strengthen the leadership of high-yield plots and make them truly high-yield bases, various regions have adopted the methods of managing wheat high-yield plots and based themselves on the spirit of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" to do a good job in spring-sown crop high-yield plot work. The land in high-yield plots is generally deep-plowed and more than 30,000 jin of base fertilizer are applied, which is one to two times more than in ordinary fields. In order to ensure the quality of the cotton high-yield plots, Anfeng People's Commune in Anyang County has grasped the "seven transformations": (1) changing uneven land into land as smooth as a mirror; (2) changing jagged land into orderly blocks; (3) changing sloping and narrow roads into flat and wide roads; (4) changing winding canals into straight canals; (5) changing scattered trees into tree-lined roads; (6) changing flood irrigation into shallow irrigation; (7) changing long and wide ridges into short and narrow ridges. After summarizing the experience of wheat high-yield plots, Ye County has stipulated "five principles" for tobacco field high-yield plots: (1) conducive to crop growth; (2) conducive to field cultivation; (3) full utilization of land; (4) able to ventilate and let light in; (5) able to drain and irrigate, ensuring a bumper harvest regardless of drought or flood. Now, the entire county is carrying out a comprehensive inspection of preparatory work for spring plowing based on this standard.

　　Currently, the large-scale autumn field high-yield plot and garden-style farming production activities are in full swing throughout the province. Among the more than 18 million agricultural labor force, nearly 5 million people are working hard every day to prepare the land, build ridges, construct field irrigation projects, and carry out all spring sowing preparations. According to statistics at the end of March, more than 2 million mu of cotton fields have been basically leveled, with sufficient base fertilizer applied, waiting for sowing. The deep plowing of land for tobacco, rice, miscellaneous grains, and various oil crops has also been basically completed, and soil loosening and moisture preservation, repair of field projects, and various sowing preparations are underway.

### 为粮、棉、油料大丰收建立基地  河南大搞春播作物丰产方

　　为粮、棉、油料大丰收建立基地
　　河南大搞春播作物丰产方
    本报郑州13日电　河南省在春耕播种中，大搞园田化和丰产方，为争取粮、棉、油料大丰收建立高产基地。
    河南省在去年丰收的基础上，今年各地制订的增产指标都比去年成倍地增长。为了保证全年粮、棉、油的更大丰收，吸取了今年小麦大搞丰产方的措施，在春播作物中要普遍实现园田化，大搞丰产方，建立高产基地。全省要求各种春播作物的丰产方面积一般要占30％到40％，丰产方的产量要超过一般田一倍以上。
    以“河南棉仓”著称的新乡专区，全区四百万亩棉田都已经深翻、平整，为了争取棉花高额丰收，全区规划了六个丰产方，面积达一百万亩，地委和专署成立了棉花丰产方联合指挥部，加强对丰产方的领导。这个专区棉花最多的安阳县，今年全县种植七十二万亩棉花，争取成为亩产五百斤皮棉县。为了保证这个计划的实现，全县搞四十万亩大面积的丰产方。随着丰产方的规划，全面实现三化：平原地区园田化、低洼地区沟洫台田化、山丘地区梯田化。并且在全县开展大面积高额丰产运动。烟叶面积占全省面积77％以上的许昌专区，也决心把全专区一百二十多万亩烟田全部改造为高级园田，现在八十多万亩早烟田，达到这个标准的已有六十四万多亩。
    在春播的粮食和油料作物中，也是以实现园田化和丰产方作为保证丰收的主要措施。开封专区规划了十二个大面积的水稻丰产区，七个红薯丰产区，五个花生丰产区和三个大豆丰产区，面积共达三百多万亩。在全区形成了一个以丰产方为中心的春耕春播高潮。
    为了加强丰产方的领导，使丰产方真正成为丰产的基地，各地都采取管理小麦丰产方的办法和依据农业“八字宪法”的精神，来搞好春播作物丰产方的工作。丰产方内的地一般都经过深翻，施底肥三万多斤，比一般大田都多施一倍到两倍。安阳县安丰人民公社为了保证棉花丰产方的质量，抓住了七改措施：（1）改高低不平的地为地平如镜。（2）改三尖八棱的地成区成方。（3）改斜路小路为平坦大马路。（4）改弯渠为直渠。（5）改零星树为林荫道。（6）改大水漫灌为小水浅浇。（7）改长畦宽畦为短畦窄畦。叶县在总结小麦丰产方的经验后，对烟田的丰产方规定了“五项原则”：（1）利于作物生长。（2）利于田间耕作。（3）充分利用土地。（4）能够通风透光。（5）能排能灌，旱涝保丰收。现在全县正根据这个标准，展开全面的备耕工作大检查。
    现在全省各地大搞秋田丰产方、园田化的生产正在如火如荼地进行着，在一千八百多万农业劳动大军中，每天有将近五百多万人，正在紧张地整地、打畦、修筑田间灌溉工程和一切春播准备工作。据3月底的统计，二百多万亩棉田都基本平整好，施足底肥，等待播种。烟叶、水稻、杂粮和各种油料作物土地深翻也都基本完成，正在进行松土保墒、修理田间工程和各项播种准备工作。　（方徨）
