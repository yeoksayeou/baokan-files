　　April Rice Seedling Cultivation in Jiangnan
　　By Our Correspondent Gu Ping
　　On the shores of Taihu Lake, barley is already showing its sharp edge in the emerald green wheat waves, sprouting thick ears. Pale purple small flowers float like stars in the green manure fields covered with branches and leaves. Canary yellow rape flowers, purplish-black broad bean flowers, pink peach blossoms, willow green, and wildflowers of various colors adorn the fields, sending the spring breeze to spread their fresh fragrance in all directions. In this Jiangnan region, where a hundred flowers are vying for beauty, small, mirror-like rice seedling fields are also attracting attention with their tender green. Members of the Shengze People's Commune in Wujiang County, while striving for a bumper harvest of spring-blooming crops, have also begun a new battle to double rice production again.
　　Late at night, Pan Wenlong, the director of the First Work Area, carrying a small square glass lamp, braved the oblique wind and dense rain, heading towards the First Production Team. His foot slipped, and he quickly supported himself with his hand on the muddy ground, almost falling into the ditch, and the lamp in his hand flickered out. This was a newly built narrow dam, with ditches on both sides. The rain made the still-unsettled soil like a pot of thin porridge. The sky was dark, and no one could be seen across the way. Pan Wenlong had to use both hands to help himself climb over the dam. Finally, he groped to the house of commune member Zhang Laiguan, knocked on the door to find a fire to light the lamp, and continued forward. Chen Ajin, the leader of the rice seedling professional management group, and the commune members were already busy in the rice seedling fields. Pan Wenlong carefully checked the irrigation situation, gave a few instructions, and ran to the Fourth Team. The waterwheel of the Fourth Team was already turning, and people were busy opening gaps in the fields. Seeing that the ox-drawn waterwheel was too slow, Pan Wenlong immediately mobilized several commune members to push together. The rain grew heavier and heavier, and the waterwheel turned faster and faster. The seedling bed quickly filled with water, and the raindrops silently hit the water surface. The newly emerged green seedlings were soaked in the water. People were so excited that they forgot it was night, forgot their fatigue, and the sound of victory drowned out the sound of wind and rain.
　　Also on this windy and rainy night, Zhang Youzhong, an old farmer from the Seventh Production Team, couldn't wait to put on his raincoat and rushed to the cowshed to lead out the water buffalo and hitch it to the waterwheel. The group members each picked up a small iron hoe and rushed to the fields to open the seedling beds. By the time the seedling fields were filled with water, their clothes were all wet. Entering the seedling shed, everyone took off their clothes and huddled around the fire to dry them. The flickering firelight illuminated everyone's face. Zhang Youzhong, a Communist Party member, is the leader of this professional group. He urged everyone to hurry up and go to sleep, but no one wanted to. In this small shed, several fiery hearts were united tightly for the collective cause. They enthusiastically talked about the task assigned to them by the team. They were responsible for cultivating twenty mu of rice seedlings, to ensure the supply for transplanting to the team's one hundred and ten mu of double-cropping early rice fields, with 70,000 seedlings per mu, thirteen seedlings per hole, seedling age around twenty-seven days, and seedling length of four inches. They were full of confidence in this task. A sense of glorious responsibility made them labor enthusiastically.
　　Also working day and night for the seedlings is Ren Changming, an old farmer who won the first prize for high-yield double-cropping early rice in the county last year. He and Wang Ami sleep in the seedling shed every day. Lifting the grass curtain in front of the seedling shed door, just one step takes you into the rice seedling field. Last year, Ren Changming was responsible for cultivating more than twenty mu of double-cropping rice, and the early rice alone yielded three thousand jin per mu. A dazzling certificate of merit and a red announcement of good news are neatly pasted on the wall of his house. When others asked him why he still slept in the seedling shed when his home was nearby, he stroked his sparse yellow beard and slowly replied, "Raising rice seedlings is like raising a three-day-old baby. Too much water and it's afraid of being stuffy, too little water and it's afraid of being dry. At night, the cold weather is afraid of frost, and too much sun is afraid of scorching. One cannot leave it for a moment! Sleeping at home, with thick walls and high roofs, whether it's cold or hot, windy or rainy, you don't have a sure grasp of things. Worrying about the seedlings, I can't sleep soundly." Indeed, he sleeps by the rice seedling field, and in the middle of the night, if he feels cold, he gets up to check the sky, so as to light a fire and smoke to prevent frost when there is frost.
　　The five hundred rice seedling management professional groups in the entire commune, selected by the masses, are all breathing with the rice seedlings, working tirelessly and meticulously to cultivate strong seedlings, forgetting sleep and food. Many experienced old farmers and Party and League members serve as the leaders of the professional groups. The quality requirements for the commune's two thousand five hundred mu of rice seedling fields this year are higher than any other year. When preparing the seedling fields, a simple level was used to measure three times, achieving the requirement of a mirror-like level surface; separate inlet and outlet ditches; and a seedling ridge higher than the seedling bed was built around each seedling bed. In this way, the water level in the seedling ditches can always be higher than the seedling bed, keeping the seedling bed moist. Xiao Liu, the commune statistician, is responsible for listening to weather forecasts on time every day. In addition to listening to the forecasts from Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Wujiang, he also takes the initiative to call the nearby Jiaxing weather forecast station to inquire. He always quickly and accurately transmits the weather information, so that everyone can take preventive measures as early as possible.
　　Every day, the leader of each rice seedling management group must "look at the sky three times" in the morning, evening, and midnight. If they discover it is going to rain, they immediately prepare for irrigation; if frost is about to fall, they immediately start smoking to prevent frost. Many professional groups have also proposed the slogan of "Boldness, Carefulness, and Quick Action." Seeing that it is about to rain, they first fill the seedling ditches with water, not rushing to irrigate the seedling beds; when the rain starts, they quickly open the water to irrigate. This is done to avoid immersing the delicate seedlings in too much water as much as possible. With such meticulous care, the commune's rice seedling fields, since the seeds were sown in mid-March, have successfully overcome five frosts and three storms, and the seedlings are growing greener and more lovable.
　　Everyone in the commune is concerned about the growth of the rice seedlings, concerned about the battle to strive for double the rice yield compared to last year, and many people consciously participate in rice seedling management. Wang Meixiang, the fertilizer accumulation group leader, and three group members row a boat to Shengze Town every day to transport miscellaneous fertilizer. In the past, they put grass ash and garbage together. Now, they have changed their method of collecting fertilizer, separating the grass ash and other garbage collected from house to house, and loading them in two boat cabins; after transporting them back, they carefully use a sieve to remove the debris from the ash, and then send the fine and clean grass ash to the rice seedling professional group. This is their intention to support rice seedling cultivation!
　　The grassy mud ponds that dot the fields are filled with river mud and green grass. The entire commune's twelve thousand five hundred mu of double-cropping early rice has already accumulated one thousand dan of base fertilizer per mu. The spring fields, prepared for transplanting rice seedlings, have already been plowed twice. The fertile land is baring its chest, fully absorbing the spring sunshine, and storing nutrients for the double-cropping early rice. The diligent Jiangnan farmers have always achieved high yields through intensive farming. This year, they are doubling their meticulousness and doubling their hard work, and they will surely receive even more abundant fruits.

　　麦浪滚滚，菜花如金；又丰收，春风送喜讯。还问早稻又何如？看——
　　江南四月育秧人
　　本报记者　古平
    太湖之滨，大麦已经在碧绿的麦浪中锋芒毕露，窜出了粗壮的穗头。淡紫色的小花满天繁星似地浮动在枝叶蔓盖的绿肥田里。鹅黄色的油菜花，紫里点黑的蚕豆花，粉桃、柳翠和各种色彩的野花缀满田野，遣使春风把她们的清新的香气散布四方。在这百花争艳的江南，一块块平整如镜的小秧田也以它们的嫩绿吸引着人们的目光。吴江县盛泽人民公社的社员们，在力争春花作物丰收的同时，又开始了一场要水稻产量再翻一番的新的战斗。
    深夜，第一工区主任潘文龙手里提着一盏玻璃小方灯，顶着斜风密雨，向第一生产队走去。脚下一滑，他连忙用手撑住泥泞的地面，人险些摔到沟里，手里的灯也晃熄了。这里正是一条刚刚修好的狭窄的坝头，两边全是河沟。雨一淋，还没踏实的泥土像一锅稀粥。天空乌黑，对面不见人。潘文龙只好用双手帮忙，爬过坝头。好容易摸到社员张来官家，敲门找火点灯，又继续前进。一队秧田专业管理组组长陈阿金和社员们早已在秧田里忙起来了。潘文龙仔细地检查了灌水情况，叮嘱几句，又向四队跑去。四队的水车已在转动，人们忙着在田里开缺口。潘文龙看到牛车水太慢，马上发动几个社员一齐用劲推。雨越下越大，水车也越转越快，秧板上很快灌足了水，雨点无声地打在水面上，刚刚露青的秧苗浸润在水里。人们兴奋得忘记了这是在夜间，忘记了疲劳，胜利的欢声淹没了风雨声。
    也是在这个风雨之夜，第七生产队老农张有忠来不及穿上蓑衣，急忙跑到牛棚里牵出水牛，套车上水。组员们一个个拿起小铁锄奔到田里开秧。等到秧田灌满水后，他们的衣服都淋湿了。进了秧棚，大家脱下衣服围着火堆烘烤。闪闪的火光照亮了每个人的脸。共产党员张有忠是这个专业组的组长，他催促大家赶快抓紧时间去睡觉，但是谁也不想睡。在这间小小的草棚里，几颗火热的心为集体的事业团结得紧紧的。他们又一遍热烈地谈起队里交给他们的任务。他们几个人负责培育二十亩秧苗，要保证供应全队一百一十亩双季早稻的大田移栽，而且每亩要有七万穴，每穴十三支秧苗，秧龄二十七天左右，苗长四寸。对这个任务，他们充满了信心。光荣的责任感使他们热情地劳动着。
    为秧苗日夜辛劳的还有去年获得全县双季早稻高额丰产一等奖的老农任长明。他和王阿米两人每天睡在秧棚里。掀起秧棚门前的草帘，只要跨出一步，就是秧田。去年，任长明负责培育二十多亩双季稻，单前作早稻每亩就打了三千斤。一张耀眼的奖状和一张红色的喜报，端端正正地贴在他家的墙上。别人问他，家就在近边，为什么还要困秧棚？他摸着稀疏的黄胡子，慢悠悠地回答：“育秧如育三朝儿，水多怕它闷气，水少怕它嫌干，夜里天冷怕霜打，日头太大又怕晒焦。一时一刻不能离人啊！睡在家里，墙厚屋高，天冷天热，起风落雨，心里没个准数儿，惦记着秧苗，觉也睡不落实。”的确是，他睡在秧田边，半夜里觉得身上冷了，就起来看看天色，以便在有霜冻时点火熏烟。
    全社由群众选出来的五百个秧田管理专业组的社员，人人都是这样和秧苗共呼吸，为培育壮秧废寝忘食、细干苦干。很多生产经验丰富的老农和党、团员担任了专业组的组长。全社二千五百亩秧田今年要求的质量比任何一年都高。做秧田时用简易水平仪测了三次，达到地平如镜的要求；进出水沟分开；每块秧板的四周都围下了一道高于秧板的秧龙。这样，秧沟中的水面就能经常高于秧板，保持秧板湿润。公社统计员小柳每天负责按时收听气象预报，他除了收听南京、杭州和吴江的预报外，还主动打电话到附近的嘉兴气象预报站联系。他总是迅速准确地把气象消息传递出去，让大家及早采取防御措施。
    每个秧田管理组的组长，每天在早晨、傍晚和半夜总要“三看天”，发现要下雨，马上做好灌水准备；要落霜，就立即动手熏烟防冻。很多专业组还提出了“胆大心细动作快”的口号，看天气快要下雨了，就先把水灌满秧沟，不忙灌进秧板；雨开始下了，再迅速开口灌水。这样做，为的是尽量不让娇嫩的幼苗过多地浸在水里。有了这样精细的照管，全社秧田从3月中旬落谷以来，已经胜利地闯过了五次霜冻和三次风雨的难关，秧苗越长越绿越可爱。
    社里的每一个人都在关怀着秧苗的生长，关怀着今年争取水稻比去年翻一番的战斗，许多人自觉地参加秧田管理。积肥组长王美香每天和三个组员摇船到盛泽镇运杂肥。过去，她们把草灰和垃圾放在一起。现在，她们改变了搜集肥料的方法，把挨家挨户搜集来的草木灰和其它垃圾分开，分装在两个船舱里；运回来以后，还细心地用漏筛把灰里的杂物筛掉，然后把又细又净的草木灰送给育秧专业组。这是她们支援育秧的心意呵！
    布满田头的草泥塘都已沤满了河泥和青草。全社一万二千五百亩双季早稻每亩已积好基肥一千担。准备栽秧的春田已经耕翻过两次。肥沃的土地正袒开胸膛，尽情地吸取春天的阳光，为双季早稻储备养料。辛勤的江南农民一向以精耕细作获得高产，今年，他们加倍地精细，加倍地辛劳，必将得到更加丰硕的果实。
