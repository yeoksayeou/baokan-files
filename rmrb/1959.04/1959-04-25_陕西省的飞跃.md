Fellow Representatives:

I fully agree with and endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, and I also agree with the various reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Premier Zhou's report accurately assesses the extremely great achievements made in various government tasks in the past few years, especially in the past year, and proposes the various tasks for continuing the overall leap forward in 1959. It has given us great encouragement and clear instructions. The people of Shaanxi Province must do everything possible to strive to realize these glorious tasks.

In 1958, Shaanxi Province, like other parts of the country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant guidance of the general line for socialist construction, achieved unprecedentedly great victories in various socialist construction endeavors.

In 1958, Shaanxi Province's industrial and agricultural production achieved enormous development. The province's total industrial and agricultural output value reached more than 5.81 billion yuan, completing 137 percent of the plan, an increase of 66 percent over 1957. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the province's total industrial and agricultural output value only increased by 1.41 billion yuan, while in 1958 alone it increased by 2.37 billion yuan.

The mass steelmaking campaign ended Shaanxi's history of having no iron and steel industry.

In 1958, Shaanxi's industrial production experienced a leap forward, especially the mass steelmaking campaign launched in the second half of 1958, which ended the history of our province having no iron and steel industry. A total of 150,000 tons of iron and more than 23,000 tons of steel were produced. "Taking steel as the key link" drove the leap forward in all aspects of industry. In 1958, the province's total industrial output value reached more than 2.23 billion yuan, an increase of 90.5 percent over 1957. Thirty large-scale industrial and mining enterprises were newly built and expanded, and nearly 200,000 medium-sized and small factories and mines were established by counties, communes, and production teams. The total output value of the machinery industry increased by nearly 100 percent compared to 1957, and more than 1,000 new products were trial-produced, many of which, such as electric motors, precision machine tools, tractors, and locomobiles, could not be produced in the past. The output of raw coal reached 4.71 million tons, an increase of 150 percent over 1957. Twenty-six new and expanded formal mines were built, with a designed annual production capacity of 6.5 million tons, equivalent to 1.7 times the total built during the province's first Five-Year Plan. Through a large-scale mass movement to find and report mineral resources, more than 50,000 new mineral sites were discovered, with more than 50 kinds of minerals found, including iron, manganese, and copper, all with considerable reserves. This changed the saying that "Shaanxi has no metallic minerals." Basic construction investment completed 103 percent of the state plan. The volume of freight transportation increased by 82 percent compared to 1957. The volume of material turnover increased by 31 percent. The various roads newly built and renovated were more than eight times the new roads added during the first Five-Year Plan period. Telephone service was realized in every township, and postal service in every village.

In the great leap forward in industrial production, the broad masses of workers and staff fully displayed their soaring revolutionary drive and the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, setting off a vigorous upsurge of socialist emulation and technical innovation. They not only overfulfilled various production plans, but also achieved great accomplishments in improving product quality, trial-producing new products, and breaking through cutting-edge technologies. As many as 2,968 new products were successfully trial-produced, and more than 300 reached the advanced level in the country. In the machinery industry, the first 1613 German-style precision lathe and the G620 all-gear lathe in the country were successfully trial-produced. The quality of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has also been greatly improved. Enamelware, cameras, film projectors, and optical theodolites have all reached the advanced level in the country in terms of quality. The preliminary trial production of high-grade polishing powder is one of the major creations in our country's industry.

The great development of commune-run industries has created a scene in the countryside where "factories are everywhere and machines are humming everywhere." According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 175,000 small factories run by communes (including those run by production teams) in the province. These small factories include light industry and heavy industry; metallurgical industry and machinery manufacturing industry; agricultural product processing industry and raw material manufacturing industry; chemical industry and food industry. The development of commune-run industries not only solved part of the current production and living needs of the masses and increased the income of communes and production teams, but also broke the outdated notion that farmers can only cultivate land and cannot run industries, accumulated experience, and trained a large number of technicians. A new type of laborer who is both farmer and worker is growing up, creating favorable conditions for realizing the industrialization of communes.

The former grain-deficient area has now become a grain-surplus area.

In 1958, Shaanxi's agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, breaking the fallacy that agriculture cannot develop at a high speed. Grain output increased by 100 percent compared to 1957, and cotton output increased by 86 percent compared to 1957. Other oil crops, bast fiber crops, and various cash crops also saw significant increases. Such high-speed development has written a new page in the history of agricultural production in our province. In terms of grain output, the Shaanxi North area has had the largest increase. This area used to be grain-deficient, requiring the transfer of 100 to 200 million catties of grain every year. After a year of hard struggle last year, it has become a region with a surplus of grain. Last year's large increase in agricultural production was closely related to the implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for increased production, especially the unprecedented development of water conservancy construction. Last year alone, the irrigated area in the province increased from more than 9 million mu to more than 31 million mu, an expansion of more than 22 million mu, equivalent to more than six times the irrigated area in the thousands of years before liberation. The area of soil and water conservation increased from more than 21,000 square kilometers to more than 51,000 square kilometers.

Last year's bumper harvest of summer and autumn crops further encouraged the enthusiasm and drive of the masses for production, and quickly set off an upsurge of autumn and winter production centered on deep plowing and manure accumulation. A total of more than 36 million mu of land were deeply plowed, and 3 trillion catties of fertilizer were accumulated and produced, so that all 23 million mu of wheat in the province were planted on deeply plowed land. In addition, with more fertilizer, denser planting, and better management, this year's wheat is growing particularly vigorously, and a bumper harvest is promising.

Cultural and educational undertakings have shown a new situation of vigorous development.

With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, my province's cultural and educational undertakings have also shown a new situation of vigorous development. On the education front, the province's education from preschool education to university education, from general education to spare-time education, has been greatly developed. In the past year, the number of students in colleges, middle schools, and primary schools throughout the province increased from more than 1.8 million in 1957 to more than 2.6 million, an increase of 43 percent over 1957. Among them, the number of universities increased from 13 to 26, with more than 35,000 students; the number of students in middle schools (including normal schools) was more than 244,000; the number of students in secondary technical schools was more than 30,000; the number of students in primary schools was more than 2.3 million. Junior middle school, primary school education and preschool education were basically popularized. Under the upsurge of people running education, more than 1,800 private middle schools and vocational middle schools, and 123,100 various spare-time middle schools, primary schools, and Red and Expert schools were established. Young and middle-aged workers and farmers have basically eliminated illiteracy and participated in various forms of spare-time learning. Moreover, many of them have become creative "native experts" and scientists from worker and peasant backgrounds.

In schools at all levels, the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor has been implemented and has achieved great success. Due to the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor, not only has the quality of teaching been greatly improved, scientific research has been promoted, but also the ideological transformation of teachers, students, and intellectuals has been strengthened, and a climate of love for labor and respect for laborers has been established.

The people's communes have shown great superiority.

On the basis of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the general improvement of the socialist and communist consciousness of the broad masses of the people, the rural areas of the province rapidly realized the people's communeization in more than a month from August to September in 1958. More than 31,400 agricultural production cooperatives in the province formed 678 people's communes. This is a major and profound historical change, which further promotes the greater leap forward in agricultural production. The great victory of steelmaking in the autumn and winter of last year, the rapid development of deep plowing and fertilizer application movements, the particularly good planting of wheat, the smooth implementation of the "small indigenous groups" policy, the leap forward development of commune-run industries, and the large-scale development and improvement of rural collective welfare undertakings have fully demonstrated the great superiority of the people's communes. The peasants excitedly sang, "The east wind blows, all flowers bloom, the Party planted trees for the people, the big trees provide shade for rest, and happiness comes with the establishment of the commune."

All of this fully shows that Shaanxi Province, like other parts of the country, had a year of overall leap forward in 1958. The most important reason why we can achieve such brilliant victories is that we have implemented the general line formulated by the Party Central and Chairman Mao: "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," and have launched a large-scale mass movement. Under the encouragement of the general line, the broad masses of cadres and people in our province have carried forward the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, broken superstitions, liberated their minds, boldly invented and created, and highly developed their labor enthusiasm. There has been a significant improvement in the leadership style, and the relationship between the Party and the government and the masses has become closer. On-site meetings, visits and evaluations, grasping both ends to bring along the middle, and launching red flag competitions have become working methods familiar to the broad masses of cadres. All of this has enabled us to overcome various difficulties and successfully complete various tasks.

Continue to go all out and strive to complete this year's tasks.

1959 is a decisive year in the three years of hard struggle, and it is also a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in various socialist construction undertakings. The people of Shaanxi Province are working hard to ensure the victorious completion of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of our province must continue to go all out, carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work, give full play to all aspects of potential strength, earnestly implement the spirit of the reports and resolutions of this National People's Congress, launch a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive with full confidence to complete and over fulfill the tasks assigned to us by the state in 1959.

Finally, let me end my speech with a poem by the peasants themselves praising the great leap forward in production and the people's communes.

"In the commune, spring plowing is in full swing, command posts are set up in the fields, the cuckoo plays the labor song, and the spring breeze wants to be a communications soldier. People everywhere are busy, wanting to make the five grains a great harvest, golden waves are rolling in the threshing field, and the good news is carried to Beijing."

    陕西省的飞跃
    赵寿山代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告，同意李富春、李先念二位副总理和彭真副委员长所作的各项报告。周总理的报告，正确估计了过去几年特别是过去一年来政府各项工作所取得的极其伟大的成就，提出了一九五九年继续全面跃进的各项任务。给了我们极大的鼓舞和明确的指示。我们陕西省全省人民一定要千方百计地为实现这些光荣的任务而奋斗。
    一九五八年陕西地区和全国各地一样，在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，各项社会主义建设事业都取得了空前伟大的胜利。
    一九五八年，陕西省工农业生产获得了巨大的发展。全省工农业总产值达到五十八亿一千多万元，完成计划的百分之一百三十七，较一九五七年增长百分之六十六。在第一个五年计划期间，全省工农业总产值仅增长了十四亿一千万元，而一九五八年一年就增长了二十三亿七千万元。
    全民炼钢铁运动结束了陕西没有钢铁工业的历史
    一九五八年，陕西的工业生产有了飞跃的发展，特别是一九五八年下半年开展的全民大炼钢铁运动，结束了我省没有钢铁工业的历史，共炼铁十五万吨，炼钢二万三千多吨，“以钢为纲”带动了工业各个方面的跃进。一九五八年全省工业总产值达到二十二亿三千多万元，比一九五七年增长百分之九十点五，新建和扩建的大型工矿企业有三十个，县、公社和生产队办的中、小型厂矿近二十万个。机械工业总产值比一九五七年增长了近一倍，试制新产品一千多种，其中许多产品如电动机、精密机床、拖拉机、锅驼机等都是过去不能生产的。原煤产量达到四百七十一万吨，比一九五七年增长了一倍半。新建和扩建的正规矿井二十六处，设计年产能力六百五十万吨，等于我省第一个五年计划建井总和的一点七倍。经过大规模的群众找矿、报矿运动，新发现矿点五万多处，找到的矿种有铁、锰、铜等五十多种，储量都相当丰富。改变了“陕西无金属矿”的说法。基本建设投资完成国家计划的百分之一百零三。交通运输的货运量比一九五七年增长百分之八十二。物资周转量增长百分之三十一。新建和改建的各种道路，为第一个五年计划期间新增各种道路的八倍多。实现了乡乡通电话，村村通邮政。
    在工业生产大跃进中，广大职工群众充分地发挥了冲天的革命干劲和敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，掀起了轰轰烈烈的社会主义竞赛高潮和技术革新运动，不仅超额完成了各项生产计划，而且在提高产品质量、试制新产品和突破尖端技术等方面，都取得了巨大的成就。试制成功的新产品达二千九百六十八种，达到全国先进水平的有三百多种。机械工业方面试制成功了全国第一部1613德型精密车床和G620型全齿轮车床。棉纱、棉布的质量也有很大提高。搪瓷、照像机、电影放映机以及光学经纬仪等，在质量上都已达到了全国先进水平。初步试制成功了高级抛光粉，是我国工业上的重大创造之一。
    社办工业的大发展，使农村出现了“遍地是工厂，到处机器响”的情景。据不完全统计，全省社办（包括生产队办的）的小型工厂达十七万五千多个。这些小型工厂中，有轻工业，也有重工业；有冶金工业，也有机械制造工业；有农村产品加工工业，也有原料、材料制造工业；有化学工业，也有食品工业。社办工业的发展，不仅解决了群众当前生产和生活中的一部分需要，增加了公社和生产队的收入，而且破除了农民只能种地不能办工业的陈腐观念，积累了经验，培养了大批技术人员，亦农亦工的新型劳动者正在成长，为实现公社工业化创造了良好的条件。
    过去的缺粮区现在变成了余粮区
    一九五八年，陕西的农业生产获得了史无前例的大丰收，打破了农业不可能高速度发展的谬论。粮食产量比一九五七年增长了一倍，棉花产量比一九五七年增长了百分之八十六。其它油料、麻类各种经济作物也都有了显著的增长。这样高速度的发展，在我省农业生产的历史上写下了新的一页。在粮食产量上，陕北地区增长幅度较大。这里过去是缺粮区，每年要调进一、两亿斤粮食，经过去年一年的艰苦奋斗，已经变成粮食自给有余的地区。去年农业的大增产，是和实行了增产“八字宪法”密切相关的，特别是和水利建设事业的空前大发展分不开的。去年一年，全省灌溉面积从九百多万亩增加到三千一百多万亩，扩大了二千一百多万亩，相当于解放以前几千年来灌溉面积的六倍多。水土保持面积从二万一千多平方公里，增加到五万一千多平方公里。
    去年夏田作物和秋田作物的大丰收，更加鼓舞了群众的生产热忱和干劲，迅速掀起了以深翻地和积肥运动为中心的秋冬季生产高潮。共深翻地三千六百多万亩，积肥、造肥三万亿斤，使全省的二千三百万亩麦子全部种在深翻的土地上，加之施肥多、下种密、管理好，因而今年麦子长的特别茁壮，丰收大有希望。
    文化教育事业出现了蓬勃发展的新局面
    随着工农业生产的大跃进，我省文化教育事业也出现了蓬勃发展的新局面。在教育战线上，全省从幼儿教育到大学教育，从普通教育到业余教育，都有了很大的发展。在过去一年中，全省大、中、小学在校学生由一九五七年的一百八十多万人，增加到二百六十多万人，比一九五七年增长了百分之四十三，其中高等学校由十三所增加到二十六所，在校学生三万五千多人；中等学校（包括中等师范）在校学生二十四万四千多人；中等技术学校在校学生三万多人；小学在校学生二百三十多万人，基本普及了初级中学、小学教育和幼儿教育。在全民办教育的高潮下，办起民办中学及职业中学一千八百多所，各种业余中、小学和红专学校十二万三千一百多所。青壮年工人、农民基本上扫除了文盲，参加了各种形式的业余学习。而且其中已有不少人成为具有创造性才能的“土专家”和工农出身的科学家。
    在各级学校中，党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针得到了贯彻，并且已经取得了很大的成就。由于教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的贯彻，不仅大大地提高了教学质量，推动了科学研究，而且加强了广大师生和知识分子的思想改造，树立了热爱劳动和尊重劳动者的风气。
    人民公社显示了巨大的优越性
    在工农业生产的大跃进和广大人民群众社会主义、共产主义觉悟普遍提高的基础上，全省农村在一九五八年的八月到九月一个多月的时间内，迅速地实现了人民公社化。全省三万一千四百多个农业生产合作社，组成了六百七十八个人民公社。这是一个重大而深刻的历史变化，它进一步促进着农业生产的更大跃进。去年秋冬大炼钢铁的伟大胜利，深翻地和施肥运动的迅速开展，麦子种的特别好，“小土群”方针的顺利贯彻，社办工业的飞跃发展，农村集体福利事业的大量发展和提高，就充分证明了人民公社的巨大优越性。农民们兴奋地歌唱道“东风吹，百花开，党给人们把树栽，树大成荫好歇凉，公社成立幸福来”。
    所有这一切，都充分说明了陕西地区一九五八年和全国各地一样，是全面大跃进的一年。我们能够获得如此辉煌胜利的原因，最重要的是我们贯彻了党中央和毛主席所制定的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，大搞了群众运动。在总路线的鼓舞下，我省广大干部和群众发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，破除了迷信，解放了思想，大胆发明创造，高度的发挥了劳动热忱。领导作风有了显著的改进，党和政府同群众的关系更加密切，现场会议，参观评比，抓两头带中间，开展红旗竞赛等，已经成为广大干部所熟悉的工作方法。这一切，就使得我们能够克服各种困难，胜利地完成各项工作任务。
    继续鼓足干劲为完成今年任务而奋斗
    一九五九年是苦战三年中有决定性的一年，也是各项社会主义建设事业更大更好更全面跃进的一年。陕西全省人民正在为确保钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标的胜利完成而努力着。我们全省人民，一定要在党中央、毛主席的领导下，继续鼓足干劲，发扬苦干、实干、巧干的精神，充分发挥各方面的潜在力量，切实贯彻本次全国人民代表大会的报告和决议精神，开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，信心百倍地为完成和超额完成一九五九年国家给我们的任务而奋斗。
    最后，让我以农民群众自己歌颂生产大跃进和人民公社的诗篇，结束我的发言吧。
    “公社里，闹春耕，田间扎下指挥棚，布谷鸟奏劳动曲，春风要当通讯兵。遍地人，忙不停，要让五谷大丰登，打麦场里翻金浪，抬上喜报上北京”。
