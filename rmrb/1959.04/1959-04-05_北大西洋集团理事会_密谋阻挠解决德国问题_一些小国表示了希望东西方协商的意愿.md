Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 4th: The North Atlantic Group Council held secret meetings on the afternoon of April 2nd and the morning of April 3rd to discuss the German question and the West Berlin question.

From information revealed by Western news agencies, it can be seen that the Western countries still hold a position of obstructing the relaxation of international tensions in this discussion. After U.S. Acting Secretary of State Herter spoke on the afternoon of April 2nd, advocating the intensification of the "Cold War," West German Foreign Minister Brentano also clamored at the meeting that Western countries must obtain concessions from the Soviet Union rather than making concessions to the Soviet Union when negotiating with the Soviet Union.

Brentano stated that the West German government opposes "any form of disengagement" and the "neutralization" of Germany, and opposes the rapid conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. He stubbornly insisted that the disarmament issue is the "starting point" for "resolving" the German question, attempting to submerge the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany in a large pile of other currently unresolvable issues, making the signing of the treaty a distant prospect.

According to Western news agency reports, the Western attitude is "essentially negative." It is rumored that the Western countries will put forward a "positive proposal" at the East-West foreign ministers meeting in May, but this "proposal" will not be "formulated" until the foreign ministers of the four Western countries meet in Paris on April 29th. It is revealed that the United States is trying to make this so-called "positive proposal" into a "package proposal," that is, to forcibly link the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the solution of the West Berlin issue with the issue of German reunification, disarmament, and so on.

It is revealed that Canadian representative, Defense Minister Pearkes, expressed a certain intention to seek a solution that would somewhat change the current status of West Berlin when he spoke at the meeting. Representatives of some small countries expressed a desire for the East and West to resolve the problem through consultation.

After the discussion, the spokesperson for the meeting said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries reached a "general agreement" on the issues of Berlin and Germany "in principle," but there were still "differences of opinion on strategy and methods."

    北大西洋集团理事会
    密谋阻挠解决德国问题
    一些小国表示了希望东西方协商的意愿
    新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：北大西洋集团理事会2日下午和3日上午举行秘密会议，讨论德国问题和西柏林问题。
    从西方通讯社透露的情况可以看出，西方国家在这个讨论中抱的仍然是阻挠国际紧张局势缓和的立场。在美国代理国务卿赫脱2日下午发言鼓吹加紧“冷战”以后，西德外交部长勃伦塔诺也在会上叫嚷什么西方国家在同苏联举行谈判时一定要从苏联那里取得让步而不是向苏联作出让步。
    勃伦塔诺表示，西德政府反对“任何形式的脱离接触”和使德国“中立化”，反对迅速缔结对德和约。他硬说裁军问题是“解决”德国问题的“起点”，企图把缔结对德和约问题淹没在其他一大堆目前不能解决的问题里，使得和约的签订遥遥无期。
    据西方通讯社报道，西方的态度“本质上是消极的”。传说西方国家将在5月的东西方外长会议上提出一个“积极的建议”，但是这个“建议”要到西方四国的外交部长4月29日在巴黎举行会议后才能“制订出来”，而据透露，美国正在力图使这个所谓“积极的建议”制订成为“一揽子建议”，就是把缔结对德和约和西柏林问题的解决硬同德国统一问题、裁军问题等扯拉在一起。
    据透露，加拿大代表、国防部长佩克斯在会上发言时表现了企图寻求一个对目前西柏林地位有所改变的方案的某种意图。一些小国的代表表示了希望东西方通过协商解决问题的意愿。
    会议发言人在讨论结束后说，北大西洋公约组织国家对柏林和德国问题在“原则上”达成了“一般的协议”，但是在“战略和方法上意见仍有分歧”。
