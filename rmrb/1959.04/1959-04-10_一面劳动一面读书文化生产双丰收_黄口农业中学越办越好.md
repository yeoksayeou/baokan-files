Simultaneously Laboring and Studying, Achieving a Double Harvest in Culture and Production
Huangkou Agricultural Middle School Gets Better and Better

    (Our report) Anhui Province’s Xiaoxian County Huangkou People-run Agricultural Middle School is getting better and better because it has implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor. In the past year or so, some students' production skills have surpassed those of experienced farmers; the quality of teaching has been continuously improved, and course exam scores are approaching the level of ordinary middle schools.
    Huangkou People-run Agricultural Middle School was established on the basis of a people-run spare-time middle school. At present, the school has 432 students and 17 teachers. The arrangement of production and teaching time is: one day of labor and one day of study. Since the school was founded, classes have never been suspended, so that teaching can proceed according to plan. Courses include Chinese, arithmetic, agricultural technology, history, music, and physical education. Physics and chemistry are added in the second year. In order to implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, 24 factories for fertilizers, pesticides, iron, and wood have been built successively last year, and a farm with 150 mu of land has been established. More than 70 kinds of fertilizers have been self-made; more than 200 kinds of pesticides have been made. According to the identification of the East China Science Institute, 47 of them meet national standards, and the insecticidal efficacy of the "311" pesticide exceeds that of "666" by 5%; 24 kinds of rayon are made from wild plants, bark, and other waste materials; wheat threshers are created, cotton ginning machines are modified into sweet potato ginning machines, and more than 130 kinds of agricultural tools are modified, which strongly supports production.
    In the teaching process, Huangkou People-run Agricultural Middle School has always implemented the combination of theory and practice, and the agricultural knowledge courses are closely integrated with the characteristics of local agricultural production for teaching. At the same time, according to the needs of production in various agricultural seasons, it has compiled textbooks on rice seedling cultivation, prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, field management, and prevention of lodging. Last year, agricultural technology teachers also helped the Sun Jinghou Youth Cotton High-Yield Team of the commune to summarize high-yield experience and then compiled teaching materials. The teaching methods adopted are a combination of classroom teaching and on-site teaching, field teaching and learning while doing. For example, when talking about "artificial auxiliary pollination of corn," students didn't understand how to "pollinate" after several lectures in the classroom. When the classroom was moved to the field, they quickly learned it by explaining and doing it at the same time. When teaching the chemical trial production of bleaching powder, students couldn't even remember the nouns, but they quickly learned it through actual operation in the factory. This teaching method not only enables students to learn systematic cultural knowledge and basic theoretical knowledge, but also to learn a set of industrial and agricultural production technologies.
    Because teaching is combined with productive labor, the knowledge learned plays a great role in production. Last year, when wheat rust occurred, students first learned the methods of preventing and controlling wheat rust, took the lead in decocting medicine and spraying it, and publicized the methods of prevention and control, saving more than 2,000 mu of wheat. Students Liu Deqian, Li Zhixian, and others learned how to use horse-drawn harvesters at school and taught the members when they returned home; during the busy farming season, students also helped production teams harvest and sow. In political movements, this school is also a propaganda team. The masses love this school very much, and the members often give a thumbs-up and praise: "Agricultural middle school, agricultural middle school, is proficient in both literature and martial arts," "No need to hire professors or build buildings, middle school is set up at the doorstep, teaching is combined with labor, and culture and production achieve a double harvest."

    一面劳动一面读书文化生产双丰收
    黄口农业中学越办越好
    本报讯　安徽省萧县黄口民办农业中学，由于贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，越办越好。一年多来，学生的生产技能有些已超过老农；教学质量不断的提高，课程考试成绩接近普通中学的水平。
    黄口民办农业中学是在民办业余中学的基础上建立起来的。目前，全校有学生四百三十二人，教师十七人。生产和教学时间安排：平常是一天劳动，一天学习，办学以来，从未停课，使教学能按计划进行。课程设有语文、算术、农业技术、历史、音乐、体育等，二年级增加物理和化学。为了执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，去年先后建起了化肥、农药、铁、木等二十四个工厂，创办了一个拥有土地一百五十亩的农场。自制化肥七十多种；农药二百多种。经华东科学研究所鉴定，其中合乎国家标准的有四十七种，“三一一”农药还超过“六六六”的杀虫效能5％；利用野生植物、树皮等废物制成二十四种人造棉；创制小麦脱粒机，把弹花机改制成弹红芋机，并改制农具一百三十多种，有力的支援了生产。
    黄口民办农业中学在教学过程中，始终贯彻了理论与实际相结合，农业知识课紧密结合当地农业生产特点进行教学。同时根据各个农业季节生产的需要，自编了水稻育秧、防止病虫害、田间管理和防止禾苗倒伏等教材。农业技术课教师，去年还帮助公社孙景厚青年棉花丰产队，总结丰产经验，然后编成教材。教学的方法，采取课堂教学与现场教学、田间教学与边干边学相结合。如讲“玉米人工辅助授粉”，在课堂上讲了几遍还闹不懂，不知怎样“授”法，把课堂搬到田间，一边讲解，一边做，就很快学会了。在讲化学试制漂白粉时，光名词学生都记不住，通过工厂实际操作，也很快学会了。这种教学方法，不但使学生学到系统的文化知识和基础理论知识，也能学到一套工农业生产技术。
    由于教学结合生产劳动，学习的知识对生产起了很大作用。去年小麦发生秆锈病时，学生首先学会了防治秆锈病的方法，一面带头熬药喷洒，一面宣传防治的办法，使二千多亩小麦得救。学生刘德千、李志贤等在学校里学会了马拉收割机使用的方法，回家就教社员；在农忙季节，学生还帮助生产队收割和播种。在政治运动中，这所学校又是一支宣传队。群众很喜爱这所学校，社员们常常竖起大姆指称赞说：“农中农中，文武皆通”、“不请教授不盖楼，中学设在家门口，教学劳动相结合，文化生产双丰收”。
