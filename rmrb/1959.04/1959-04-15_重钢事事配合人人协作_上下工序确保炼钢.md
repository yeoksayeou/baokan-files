　　Chongqing Iron and Steel Corporation Coordinates Everything, Everyone Cooperates
　　Upper and Lower Procedures Ensure Steelmaking
    (Our Newspaper News) Chongqing Iron and Steel Corporation, in mobilizing workers to engage in large-scale technological revolution and fighting against local iron with high sulfur content, adopted a vertical and horizontal "one-dragon" method of organizing and leading production, based on the characteristics of continuous and collective steelmaking production, effectively improving the output and quality of steel.
    The "one-dragon" method of Chongqing Iron and Steel Corporation involves taking the steelmaking furnace as the "龙头" (leading element), in the steelmaking production process, and comprehensively organizing the workers in the upper and lower shifts and related procedures on the left and right, so that each link is organically coordinated, and they cooperate and fight together, all to serve the "leading element".
    This set of methods is first manifested in: cadres participating in labor in a "one-dragon" style. From the Party Secretary, Manager, Director to all cadres and engineering technical personnel, they all combine their own business and adopt the method of regular timing and fixed-point, and participate in the relevant procedures for labor. In this way, from the front of the furnace "leading element" to all links in the entire production process, there are leading cadres participating in labor, and problems are discovered and resolved in a timely manner, so that the specific ideological work and organizational leadership work in production are greatly strengthened. Second, organize cadres and workers to formulate plans in a "one-dragon" style. In the past, the formulation of plans was based on the workshop leaders and relevant functional personnel drawing up daily and shift plans, and then announcing them to the workers for execution. Now, the leading cadres, workers and engineering technical personnel of various work sections such as before and after the furnace all participate together and formulate them together, and with the furnace front as the center, the furnace front workers first put forward the furnace front steel output plan and the requirements for each work section according to the "reconnaissance" situation before starting work, and then each work section puts forward its own plan and measures around the steel output plan. In doing so, not only is the sense of responsibility of the masses for completing the plan strengthened, but also the mutual understanding and cooperation between the various work sections is promoted, and the leading and tail elements are twisted into a rope, and if any work section has difficulties, other work sections will immediately organize forces to assist in solving them. Third, organize "one-dragon" cooperation in steelmaking, and jointly ensure the realization of the production plan. Fourth, "one-dragon" style of timely evaluation, summary and promotion of advanced experience. After work, the workers hold a "four evaluation meeting" (evaluation of production, evaluation of quality, evaluation of operation, evaluation of safety), and through evaluation, they timely summarize the experiences and lessons of this shift, and hand them over to the workers of the next shift together with the task, so that "lessons do not pass the shift, and experience does not pass the night."
    After Chongqing Iron and Steel Corporation used this set of vertical and horizontal "one-dragon" methods to organize production, significant results have been achieved in all aspects. In the past, in steelmaking production, only the steelmaking section was often grasped. Now, through the "one-dragon" formulation of plans and joint organization of cooperative steelmaking, everyone clearly recognizes their responsibility in making a good furnace of steel, and each procedure forms a production whole, all providing conditions for making this furnace of steel well. In this way, the spirit of communist cooperation is greatly promoted.
    Through the "one-dragon" method, the participation of cadres in labor is combined with leading production and improving production management. The Party Committee of Chongqing Iron and Steel Corporation particularly emphasized the participation of cadres in labor; the fact that economic work and the Party's ideological work can be done more carefully is also an important aspect. After the cadres of this company participated in labor, they not only improved their business, but also strengthened their leadership over production, becoming a force to promote production.
    Due to the implementation of the "one-dragon" method, the great cooperation of workers in production was promoted, and a competitive upsurge of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced was set off, so the production landscape was completely renewed. Not long ago, everyone felt that local iron with high sulfur was a very troublesome thing. Recently, after the joint efforts of cadres and workers throughout the company, and engaging in large-scale technological revolution, the law of using local iron to make steel was basically mastered in a short period of time, and the output and quality of steel rose linearly. For example, the steelmaking of the converter plant appeared an unprecedented situation where every furnace was qualified and every shift was qualified. Everyone no longer regarded the making of good steel from local iron as a difficult task. Local iron can not only make steel, but also make high-quality steel with very low sulfur content.

### 重钢事事配合人人协作  上下工序确保炼钢

　　重钢事事配合人人协作
　　上下工序确保炼钢
    本报讯　重庆钢铁公司在发动职工大搞技术革命，和土铁高硫作斗争中，根据炼钢生产连续性、集体性较大的特点，采取了纵横“一条龙”的组织生产领导生产的方法，有效地提高了钢的产量和质量。
    重钢纵横“一条龙”的方法，是在炼钢生产过程中，以炼钢炉这一主要工序为“龙头”，把上下班和左右各有关工序的职工通盘组织起来，使各个环节有机配合，协同作战，都为“龙头”服务。
    这一套方法，首先表现在：干部“一条龙”式的参加劳动。从党委书记、经理、厂长到所有干部、工程技术人员都结合本身业务，采取定时定点的办法，参加到有关工序进行劳动。这样，从炉前“龙头”到整个生产过程中各个环节都有领导干部参加劳动，发现问题及时解决，使生产中具体的思想工作和组织领导工作大大加强了。第二，组织干部、职工“一条龙”式的编制计划。过去编制计划是由车间领导和有关职能人员编出每日、每班的计划后，向工人宣布执行。现在是由炉前、炉后等各个工段的领导干部、工人和工程技术人员一起参加，共同编制，而又以炉前为中心，先由炉前工人根据上班前“侦察”的情况，提出炉前的出钢计划及对各个工段的要求后，各个工段便围绕着出钢计划，提出自己的计划和措施。这样做，不仅加强了群众对完成计划的责任感，同时也更促进了各个工段之间的互相了解与协作配合，龙头龙尾拧成一股绳，哪个工序有困难，其他工序便马上组织力量协助解决。第三，组织“一条龙”的协作炼钢，共同保证生产计划的实现。第四，“一条龙”式的及时评比、总结和推广先进经验。工人们每次下班后，都要召开“四评会”（评生产、评质量、评操作、评安全），通过评比，及时总结这一班的经验、教训，连同任务一起交给下一班的工人，做到了“教训不过班，经验不过夜”。
    重庆钢铁公司用这套纵横“一条龙”的办法组织生产以后，各方面都获得了显著的成效。过去，在炼钢生产中，往往只是抓了炼钢这一工段。现在，通过“一条龙”的编制计划、共同组织协作炼钢，个个都明确认识到在炼好一炉钢中自己应负的责任，各个工序形成一个生产整体，都为炼好这一炉钢提供条件。这样，共产主义大协作的精神就大大发扬起来。
    通过“一条龙”的方法，把干部参加劳动，同领导生产、改进生产管理结合起来。重钢党委特别强调干部参加劳动；经济工作和党的思想工作能够做得更加细致，这也是一个重要方面。这个公司的干部参加劳动以后，不仅改进了业务，同时也加强了对生产的领导，成了推动生产的一支力量。
    由于实行“一条龙”的方法，促进了职工生产的大协作，掀起了学先进、赶先进的竞赛热潮，因此，生产面貌焕然一新。不久以前，大家还感到土铁硫高是一个很伤脑筋的事，最近，经过全公司干部、职工协同努力，大搞技术革命，短期内就基本掌握了使用土铁炼钢的规律，钢的产量、质量直线上升，如转炉厂炼钢出现了炉炉合格、班班合格空前未有的局面。大家再不把土铁炼好钢当难事，土铁不仅可以炼钢，而且炼出了含硫很低的优质钢。
