    "Girl Cars" on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau
    By our reporter Chen Weigeng
    The masses at the large and small stations along the滇黔 (Dian-Qian) Highway and 川滇 (Chuan-Dian) Highway are very familiar with the five female drivers of Yunnan. Whenever the trucks, filled with camellias, azaleas, or other wildflowers, arrive, people immediately shout, "The girl cars are here!" and crowd around to see. If the cars just pass by in a flash, people will count, "One has passed, there are four more," "There are three more," "There are two more"...
    Young girls, driving big trucks, hauling trailers, relentlessly rushing day and night across the plateau, delivering batch after batch of materials needed for the nation's construction and the people's daily necessities to their destinations – this is indeed an enticing job. When I arrived at the Zhan Yi Transportation Main Station and heard about these five girls, I was immediately drawn in.
    The next day, I met Kong Qingfen and Zhao Hongzhen. Qingfen is a quiet girl of medium height, while Zhao Hongzhen is a bit more robust, but not particularly tall either. Both are around twenty years old and are quite shy around strangers. When I asked them to talk about their production achievements and how they overcame difficulties, they blushed even more.
    "They're all just kids, always laughing and crying. If they're not allowed to run long-distance, they cry; if they're not allowed to haul trailers, they cry; but they laugh when their requests are met," said Old Wu, the branch secretary of the team.
    Some of the leaders at the station also praised them, saying, "Not long ago, they even challenged the male drivers who didn't have trailers!"
    Whenever they got to work, some of the veteran drivers would slam the table and say, "What's going on? Are we really not as good as the female comrades?"
    Originally, they were the first batch of female drivers trained by the Yunnan Province Driver Training Class. Before that, they were all rural girls who had never left their homes. They only started driving in January last year. When they first officially sat in the driver's seat, driving their vehicles across the country's mountains, rivers, and fields, each of them felt a warm current of happiness flooding their hearts, and they all secretly resolved to excellently complete the national task and never fall behind the male comrades. However, initially, the leaders only allowed them to run short-distance routes, which made them very uncomfortable. Especially last year, there was a period when there was little freight for short-distance routes, while a large amount of construction materials was piled up in Duyun, Guizhou, and Chongqing, unable to be transported back. The girls became even more anxious and repeatedly requested to run long-distance routes.
    "Let us run long-distance!" Once, the girls surrounded the captain.
    "You should still run short-distance to gain experience! The long-distance routes are far and the mountains are high. If something happens, it's no joke," the well-meaning captain replied, not understanding the girls' feelings.
    "It's always about gaining experience and the routes being far and the mountains being high! We can only gain experience by overcoming difficulties!"
    "The male comrades who graduated with us can all run long-distance, why can't we?"
    "If we're not allowed to run long-distance, what will happen to the national task?" the girls clamored. At this moment, a veteran driver chimed in:
    "We don't need you to complete the task, it's good enough that you can drive."
    "This is discrimination against women!" The girls were very agitated and suddenly burst into tears.
    "Alright, alright, don't cry, we'll let you run long-distance." The girls heard the captain speak and suddenly started laughing again.
    And so, from June last year, the five girl cars have been relentlessly rushing day and night on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, transporting large quantities of brown sugar, tea, rice, and cotton yarn from Yunnan to Chongqing and Duyun, Guizhou, and transporting back steel, gasoline, sulfuric acid, and other construction materials from Chongqing and Duyun.
    During the Great Leap Forward in steel production, more than ten thousand tons of materials were piled up outside Yunnan Province, unable to be transported in. The Provincial Transportation Bureau proposed breaking the superstition that trailers could not be hauled on steep mountains and slopes, and vigorously promoted the trailer-hauling movement. Many experienced drivers hitched up trailers. At this time, the girls' hearts boiled again, and they kept requesting to hitch up trailers. Finally, starting in November, they all hitched up trailers and ran long-distance routes. With this, the girls' enthusiasm grew even greater.
    The girls also encountered many difficulties along the way. But they understood that if the country was to make a Great Leap Forward, the tasks had to be completed. Many difficulties that were previously unimaginable were conquered by them one by one. On a hot day, Zhao Hongzhen transported a load of brown sugar from Lantianba, Sichuan, to Longchang during the day. By the time she had loaded sweet potato seedlings to go from Lantianba to Gulin, it was already past two o'clock in the morning. The other drivers advised her to rest for the night and leave the next day. She was afraid that the sweet potato seedlings would rot if left for too long, so she didn't hesitate to decide to make another trip.
    "Is the road to Gulin easy to travel?" She had never traveled this road before, so she habitually inquired about it from the comrades at the station.
    "It's difficult! The slopes are steep, the road is narrow, and the road surface is bad!"
    "Easy or difficult, we have to gain experience." Thinking this, she said thank you, jumped into the car, and drove off.
    The road was indeed difficult to travel. Many places could only allow one car to pass, and on one side was the mountain, and on the other side was the ditch. A slight deviation would cause the car to roll into the deep ditch. Coincidentally, halfway there, the carburetor malfunctioned, and the car went slower and slower, until it could no longer move on a hillside. At this time, it was about four o'clock in the morning, and the surroundings were pitch black, and several wolf howls could be heard in the distance. But a sense of responsibility aroused her greatest courage. She got out of the car, repaired the machine, and continued to drive forward.
    "She's really a young calf who's not afraid of tigers. She actually made it through!"
    Through casual conversation, they gradually became familiar with me, and their speech was no longer so restrained.
    "We can't explain it, why don't you take a trip with us, that way you'll understand everything you need to know."
    How much I wanted to take a trip with them, but time did not allow it. New work tasks were waiting for me to rush back immediately. The more exciting stories of their struggles will have to wait for the next interview. (Attached picture)

### 云贵高原上的“姑娘车”

    云贵高原上的“姑娘车”
    本报记者　陈渭庚
    滇黔公路和川滇公路沿途大小车站的群众，都非常熟悉云南的五位女司机。每当那插满山茶花、杜鹃花或其他野花的货车来到时，人们立刻传呼着：“姑娘车来了！”纷纷拥上来看。如果汽车只是一掠而过，人们也会数着：“过去了一个、还有四个”、“还有三个”、“还有两个”……。
    年轻的姑娘，开着大汽车，挂着拖兜，日夜不停地奔驰在高原上，把祖国建设所需要的物资和人民生活必需品，一车车地运到目的地，这确是一件诱人的工作。我来到沾益运输总站，听见有这么五个姑娘时，也被吸引住了。
    第二天我会见到孔庆芬和赵洪珍。庆芬是个中等身材的文静姑娘，赵洪珍比她结实些，但也不特别高大。两人都是二十来岁，见了生人十分腼腆；当我请她们谈谈生产成绩和怎样克服困难的时候，更是羞得满脸绯红。
    “都是些孩子，就是爱哭爱笑。不让跑长途也哭，不让挂拖兜也哭，满足了要求就笑。”车队支部书记老吴说。
    站里的一些领导人也夸奖她们说：“不久前，她们还向没有挂拖兜的男驾驶员挑战哩！”
    每当她们干起来，一些老师傅就拍桌子说：“怎么搞的，我们难道连女同志也赶不上？”
    “原来，她们都是云南省驾驶人员训练班培养出来的第一批女司机。在这以前，她们都是没有出过门的农村姑娘。去年1月才开始开车。当她们第一次正式坐上驾驶台，驾着车子越过祖国的山川、田野时，每个人的心里都被幸福的暖流浸润着，并且一个个都暗下决心，出色地完成国家任务，决不落在男同志后面。但是，最初领导只让跑短途，这使她们很不舒服。特别是去年有个时期短途货少，而在贵州都匀和重庆又积压了大批建设物资运不回来，姑娘们更着急了，接二连三地要求跑长途。
    “让我们跑长途吧！”有一回姑娘们把队长包围起来。
    “你们还是跑短途锻炼锻炼吧！长途路远山高，出了事可不是玩的。”好心的队长不了解姑娘们的心情，给她们这样的回答。
    “又是锻炼，又是路远山高！克服困难才能锻炼哩！”
    “和我们一起毕业的男同志都能跑长途，为什么我们不能？”
    “不叫我们跑长途，国家任务又完不成怎么办？”姑娘们嚷了起来。这时有个老师傅插进来说：
    “不要你们完成任务，你们能开车也就不错了。”
    “这是轻视妇女！”姑娘们激动得很，并且一下子都哭起来。
    “好了，别哭了，给你们跑长途就是了”。姑娘们听见队长开了口，一下子又都笑起来。
    就这样，从去年6月起，五辆姑娘车就日夜奔驰在云贵高原上，把大批红糖、茶叶、大米、棉纱从云南运到重庆和贵州都匀，又从重庆、都匀运回钢材、汽油、硫酸等建设物资。
    大战钢铁时，云南省外积压了万吨以上的物资运不进来，省运输局提出打破山大坡陡不能挂拖车的迷信，大搞拖挂运动，许多有经验的驾驶员都挂上了拖兜。这时，姑娘们的心又沸腾了，又不停地要求挂拖兜。终于从11月份起，她们又都挂上了拖兜，跑了长途。这一来，姑娘们的干劲更大了。
    姑娘们在途中也曾遇到许多困难。可是她们懂得，祖国要大跃进，任务必须要完成。许多过去想像不到的困难都一一被她们征服了。一个炎热的日子，赵洪珍白天从四川蓝田坝到隆昌运了一趟红糖，等到装满红薯秧，再从蓝田坝到古蔺去的时候，已经是深夜两点多钟了。司机们都劝她歇一晚，第二天再走。她怕红薯秧放久了要烂，毫不犹豫地决定再跑一趟。
    “到古蔺去的路好走吗？”她没有走过这条路，照例地向站上的同志打听一下。
    “难走呵！坡大路窄，路面又不好！”
    “好走难走都得锻炼。”她这样想着，说了声谢谢，跳上车就开走了。
    这条路果然难走。许多地方只能通过一辆车，而且一边是山，一边是沟，稍歪一点，就会滚到深沟里去。偏偏走在半路上，化油器出了毛病，越走越慢，到一个山坡前再也走不动了。这时大约四点多钟，周围黑洞洞的，远处又传来几声狼嗥，可是责任心鼓起了她的最大勇气，她下车来修理好机器，继续向前开去。
    “真是初生犊儿不怕虎。她居然闯过来了！”
    通过漫谈，她们和我渐渐熟悉了，说话不再那么拘束了。
    “我们不会说，你跟我们跑一趟车吧，那样你会了解到所需要的一切。”
    我是多么想跟她们跑一趟车呵，时间不允许，可是新的工作任务等待我立即赶回去，关于她们的更精彩的斗争事迹只好等待下次采访了。（附图片）
