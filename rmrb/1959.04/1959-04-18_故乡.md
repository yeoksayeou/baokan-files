　　Hometown
　　Zhou Jianren
    I left my hometown (Shaoxing) many years ago, and when I returned last year, it was like seeing an old friend. But old friends, after a long separation, are bound to have aged; my hometown, however, was not like this, but rather had become younger.

    Shaoxing is a place with many rivers. In the past, the river water in the urban area was very dirty. Especially in the summer, the water in the city emitted a foul odor. The color was bluish-black. In recent years, because the dyeing shops have been moved to the suburbs, and residents no longer dump garbage into the river, coupled with dredging, the water has become clear.

    The urban area has Fu Mountain, also known as Dragon Mountain, which was barren and filthy in the past. Upon seeing it again this time, it had been planted with forests, and the entire mountain was lush and green. A park has been opened at the foot of the mountain, and there are green wisteria trellises with wisteria flowers everywhere on the mountain. There are benches under the trellises for visitors to rest. Middle school students are often studying in the Wanghai Pavilion.

    Anyone who has lived in the urban area of Shaoxing for a while will never forget one thing upon returning this time, which is that when walking around Qiuguan District, the constant dinging sounds that used to be heard are no longer heard. This is because these places used to have tin foil workshops, which would beat narrow, small pieces of tin into very thin, large sheets of tin foil. After several procedures, they were made into silver ingots. Now, these workshops are no longer seen. Some areas, however, have built steelmaking and iron smelting furnaces. The workers who used to be engaged in the above-mentioned superstitious handicrafts (referring to beating tin foil, etc.) are now steelworkers. In the past, it was said that Zhejiang had no iron or coal without exploration, so it could only engage in light industry, such as silk weaving. The iron from the current Shaoxing Steel Plant is extracted from this county. It has also been discovered that many counties produce coal.

    To improve production, science and technology are indispensable. For example, electric irrigation has been implemented in the paddy fields of Haining County. One machine can irrigate six to seven thousand acres of land. At one place I saw, two young women were taking turns managing it. When a short copper pipe on the machine was pulled up, a large amount of water flowed in; when pressed down, the water stopped. The work of two young girls can replace 10,000 to 20,000 workdays (referring to irrigating with foot-operated waterwheels in the past).

    The power of machines is astonishingly great. We must use it to serve mankind. It is entirely possible, and it can be done, to do seven or eighty hours of labor with a machine in just one hour, and even to do seven or eight thousand days of labor in just one day. Therefore, we must study science, learn science, and work hard, harder, and harder, without a moment's懈怠!

　　故乡
　　周建人
    我离开故乡（绍兴）已许多年，去年回去，如见故人。但故人久别重逢，必然老了；故乡却不是这样，反年青了。
    绍兴本是多河道的地方。过去城区河水很脏。特别到了夏季，市中的水发出臭气。颜色是呈蓝黑色的。近年由于染店已搬往郊外；居民不再把垃圾倒入河中。再加以疏浚，水澄清了。
    城区有府山，又名龙山，过去荒芜而且污脏。这次重见，已植了林，满山青彩。山下开辟了公园，山上随处有绿色紫藤棚，缠绕着紫藤花。棚下有长椅，供游人休息。望海亭中常有中学生在温课。
    曾在绍兴城区住过稍久的人，此次回去，决不会忘记的一事，是走到秋官地等处，过去常听到叮叮当当之声，今已没有听到了。由于过去这些地方开设着锡箔作坊，将狭长、小片的锡，打成很薄，大张的锡纸。再经过几番手续，制成银锭。现在这等作坊已不复见。有的地区却建设了炼钢炼铁的炉子，过去从事上述迷信手工业（指打锡箔等等）的工人，现在已成为钢铁工人。过去未经勘探，即说浙江没有铁和煤。所以说只能搞轻工业，如织绸之类。现在的绍兴钢铁厂的铁即从本县采取来的。还发见许多县里都产煤。
    要求提高生产，便省不了科学与技术。举例来说，海宁县水田已实行了电气灌溉。一部机器能灌溉六七千亩田。我看到的一处，由二个女的青少年轮班管着，那机器上面的一个短铜管，拉起，水就大量地放入，揿下，水就停止了。二个小姑娘的工作，就能顶替一、两万工日（指与过去用脚踏的水车来灌溉）。
    机器的力量之大惊人。必须利用它，为人类服务。七八十小时的劳动量，用机器只要一小时就能做好，以至七八千日的劳动量，只要一天就能做好，是十分可能的，而且也能做到的。所以必须一刻也不懈怠的钻研科学，学习科学，努力再努力！
