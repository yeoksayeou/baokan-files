    Poetry Grandpa
    Member of Red Star People's Commune, Qian Zhongliang
        Corn piled high, piercing the sky, only two feet from heaven,
        Corn stacked into a road to the sky, a heroic leap to heaven.

    This is a work by Jin Shengrun, a 73-year-old farmer from White Temple Village, praising last year's great corn harvest. Everyone who sees it says it's a good poem. But who knows that for these short twenty-eight characters, the old man spent three days and stayed up two nights.

    Last year's enthusiastic production leap forward brought an unprecedented bumper harvest in the autumn fields. Ears of corn spiraled up the tall trees, wrapping around them several feet high; trees inside and outside the village were fully covered. Old man Jin Shengrun had worked the land his whole life, but he had never seen such a great harvest. He stood under the tree, looking up for a while, then going closer to lovingly stroke the corn... He said and laughed to himself, "Good! Good!" Jin Shengrun, who already had a habit of writing poetry, secretly opened his mental manuscript: "Corn three feet high on the tree," "Ears of corn swirling around the treetops," thinking of a line and then rejecting it, always feeling it wasn't quite right. He simply stood under a tall tree, staring at the corn covering the tree, and began to ponder... As time passed, his eyes blurred, and he looked at the tree as if it were connected to the sky. His heart stirred, and he blurted out: "Corn piled high, piercing the sky, only two feet from heaven." He couldn't think of the next two lines. He tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep. He thought, with so much grain from the harvest, what are the benefits? It's a good life. Just saying "good life" is too bland, but how to make it more exciting? He thought: They say paradise is good. With so much grain, wouldn't farmers be able to leap to heaven in one step? He pondered for three days before composing it into its current form.

    In the eyes of this old man who "has seen through the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China," now "everything is new and fresh." Therefore, this man who used to pretend to be old, is now truly old but refuses to accept it. People say he's an "old codger," but when the Party announced the General Line, the old man sang loudly: "Like adding flowers to brocade!" When the US imperialists invaded Taiwan, his anger blazed, and he composed, "Roll up sleeves and move Mount Tai, sure to smash the heads of the American thieves!" Whenever there's a movement or something new, he has to write a verse. Many young people in the village learn from him. Young and old, whether they call him grandpa or not, they all call him "Poetry Grandpa." (Attached picture)

    诗爷爷

        盘盘玉米冲九霄，离天只有二尺高，
        玉米堆成通天路，一步登天逞英豪。
    这是白庙村七十三岁的老农金生润，歌颂去年玉米大丰收的一首作品。看到的人，都说这是一首好诗。可是，谁知道为了这短短的二十八字，老人却花费了三天时间，熬过了两个夜。
    去年热火朝天的生产跃进，换来了秋田的空前丰收，玉米串围着几丈高的树一盘盘地盘上去，村里村外的树上都盘得满满的。金生润老汉务了一辈子庄稼，可是像这样的大丰收，还是头一次看到。他站到树下仰着头看一阵子，再去到跟前疼爱地抚摸一阵子……。一个人又说又笑地：“好啊！好啊！”已经有了编诗习惯的金生润，心里就暗暗地打开了诗稿：“玉米上树三丈高”，“盘盘玉米旋树梢”，想一句又否定一句，总觉得不来劲。他索兴站在一棵高大的树下，盯着满树的玉米，开始沉思，……时间一长，眼花了，他看着树好像和天连在了一起。心一动，脱口而出：“盘盘玉米冲九霄，离天只有二尺高。”下两句没想下。晚上翻来复去睡不着，他想，有了这么多丰收的粮食，好处是啥呢？是好生活。光说好生活太没味气，可是又咋比方才来劲呢？他想：都说天堂好，有了这么多的粮食，农民岂不是可以一步登天。就这样琢磨了三天，才编成现在这个样子。
    这个“清朝民国都看穿”的老人的眼里，如今却是“样样事情都新鲜。”因此，这个过去不老装老的人，如今真老了却不服老。人说他是个“老?家”，党公布了总路线，老人高声歌唱：“好比锦上把花添”。反美帝侵略台湾的时候，他怒火熊熊，编了“袖子一挽搬泰山，定把美贼头砸烂”。凡是啥运动、啥新事他就要来上一段。村里许多青年人都跟他学，老老少少，叫爷不叫爷的都把他叫作“诗爷爷”。（附图片）
