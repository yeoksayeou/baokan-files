Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I completely agree with Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report, wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's report, and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian's reports.
    Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, our motherland has victoriously completed and overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan, and last year achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward, laying the initial foundation for socialist industrialization. The contributions of the 600 million working people in these years have been great. This has given us a profound lesson: labor creates the world. This year, the Party and the government have proposed a national economic plan for a greater leap forward centered on the four major targets. The working people of the whole country are striving to overfulfill this inspiring plan with greater revolutionary drive. During our inspections, we have personally seen that from the fields to the factory workshops, the working people are engaging in technical revolution and launching red flag competitions with heroic spirit and soaring drive. In our daily lives, we are constantly in contact with these achievements of socialist creation. For intellectuals, apart from the reactionaries, it is unimaginable that they would remain unmoved and unchanged in their ideology. Therefore, Premier Zhou instructed: "All old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-remolding in future long-term work practice." How touching and earnest!
    This year is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the fortieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. The May Fourth Movement was the beginning of the new democratic revolution under the influence of the October Revolution. At that time, advanced intellectuals who accepted Marxism-Leninism united with workers and peasants, organized the Chinese Communist Party, and led the Chinese revolution. Over the past forty years, through tortuous and arduous struggles, they overthrew the reactionary rule, drove out imperialism, and established the People's Republic of China, creating these great historical achievements.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party has led us into the stage of socialist revolution. Over the past ten years, we have achieved a series of great achievements on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, and the face of the motherland has undergone fundamental changes. Today, workers are throwing themselves into the cultural and technological revolution with a communist spirit, farmers have organized people's communes, and in the communes, the combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers is becoming multifaceted laborers. The bourgeoisie is being eliminated, so how can old intellectuals not combine with the working people to serve the socialist cause?
    Since the anti-Rightist rectification campaign, the Party has continued to implement the policy of uniting, educating, and remolding old intellectuals, helping everyone to have opportunities for labor training. Many who have participated in labor training have changed their views of belittling labor, changed their illusion of being superior, and realized that they must be ordinary laborers. In this way, they have seen a new world, in which, unlike the past when scholars looked down on each other, suspected each other, and even oppressed each other, people serve the people, help each other, care for each other, and unite closely. Looking back at my past idea of belittling labor and being superior, what an ugly exploitative class worldview this is. That is to say, my view of the relationship between people has changed greatly.
    I am a scientific and cultural worker. In the business practice of scientific work, my view of science has also changed.
    Last July, I had the opportunity to visit Zhejiang Province's rice harvest. One of the experiences of the bumper harvest was deep plowing and close planting. A botanist suggested that the roots of rice grow shallowly and horizontally, so he doubted what effect deep plowing would have? Would close planting hinder the roots from growing horizontally? This doubt seems to be based on scientific evidence. A leading comrade of the Party asked: Can deep plowing and close planting change the morphological growth of the roots, from shallow to deep, from horizontal to vertical? Then I suddenly realized that the so-called "scientific evidence" was originally a reflection of conservative thinking. From the production practice of the working people, I realized that people can transform plants. Further discussion revealed that in the past, under the feudal social system, peasants were oppressed by landlords and their enthusiasm for production was not high, so they planted rice shallowly and sparsely; today, under the socialist system, peasants' enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high, so deep plowing and close planting have resulted in bumper harvests and changed the shape of the rice roots. Here we can see that socialist production relations liberate the productive forces and also liberate science.
    It is not only the case in agricultural production practice, but also in industrial and medical practice, the Great Leap Forward has broken through conservative ideas in science. For example, past scientific theories believed that it was impossible to cool generators with water, but now it has been achieved. In medical work practice, it was previously believed that acute appendicitis could only be treated with surgery, but now acupuncture can be used without surgery. In Shanghai, more than 90% of thousands of cases have been successful. These business practices, through the revolution in science and technology, cannot but cause ideological remolding for us old intellectuals.
    Last year's Great Leap Forward had such an ideological remolding effect on intellectuals, but it was still somewhat passive. This year, to complete a greater leap forward, we must actively continue to remold our old ideas. Therefore, I personally have such a view: for the socialist cause of the motherland, in order to invest in this year's Great Leap Forward, we must actively, consciously and continuously remold our thinking in order to continue to achieve a better leap forward.
    Today's conference is a conference of unity and a conference of leap forward. Premier Zhou calls on us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, under the guidance of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, to unite closely and use active actions to complete and overfulfill the 1959 plan to welcome the tenth anniversary of the establishment of our great motherland – the People's Republic of China! I must respond to Premier Zhou's call with active actions of continuous remolding and better leap forward.
    If there is anything incorrect in what I have said above, please criticize and correct it.

### 不断改造　更好跃进  卢于道委员谈对科学的看法的改变

    不断改造　更好跃进
    卢于道委员谈对科学的看法的改变主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意李维汉副主席的报告，衷心拥护周总理的报告，及李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告。
    我们祖国在伟大的中国共产党领导下，胜利地完成和超额完成了第一个五年计划，去年又获得了空前的大跃进，奠定了社会主义工业化的初步基础。这些年来，六亿多劳动人民的贡献是伟大的。这给我们深刻的教育，那就是劳动创造世界的一课。今年党和政府提出以四大指标为中心的更大跃进的国民经济计划，全国劳动人民正以更大的革命干劲，争取超额完成这个振奋人心的计划。我们在视察的时候，已亲自看到从田里到工厂车间，劳动人民正以英雄气概、冲天干劲，大闹技术革命，展开红旗竞赛。我们在日常生活中，到处都接触到这些社会主义的创造业绩，对知识分子来说，除反动派之外，既是目击身受，在思想意识上，如果是依然故我无动于衷，那是不可想像的。因此周总理指示说：“一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造”。语重心长，多么使人感动。
    今年是中华人民共和国成立十周年，又是“五四”运动四十周年。“五四”运动是在十月革命影响下新民主主义革命的开始。那个时候，接受了马克思列宁主义的先进知识分子，结合了工人农民，组织了中国共产党，领导了中国的革命事业。四十年来，经过了曲折艰苦的斗争，打倒了反动统治，赶走了帝国主义，建立了中华人民共和国，创造了这些伟大的历史功绩。
    自从中华人民共和国成立之后，党领导我们进入了社会主义革命阶段，十年来在经济战线上政治战线上思想战线上获得了一系列的伟大成就，祖国的面貌起了根本性的变化。今天工人以共产主义风格投入文化革命与技术革命，农民组织了人民公社，在公社里，工、农、商、学、兵结合起来，正在成为多面手的劳动者，资产阶级正在消灭中，那末旧知识分子不和劳动人民相结合，怎么能为社会主义事业服务呢？
    反右整风以来，党继续贯彻执行对旧知识分子团结、教育、改造的政策，帮助大家有劳动锻炼的机会。很多参加过劳动锻炼者，改变了轻视劳动的观点，改变了高人一等的错觉，看到自己必须作为一个普通劳动者，这样就看到了一个新的世界，在这个世界里，和过去文人相轻、互相猜疑、以致互相倾轧完全不同，而是为人民服务，互相帮助、互相关怀，亲密团结。再回过头来看自己过去轻视劳动高人一等的想法，这是多么丑恶的剥削阶级世界观。这亦就是说，对人和人之间的关系的看法，有了很大的改变。
    我是一个科学文教工作者，在科学工作的业务实践中，对科学的看法，亦有了改变。
    去年七月我曾有机会去参观浙江省的水稻丰收，丰收的经验中有一条是深耕密植。有一位植物学家提出，水稻的根是浅而向横方面生长，因此怀疑深耕究竟有什么作用？密植是否会妨碍根向横方面的生长？这个怀疑似乎是有科学根据的。有位党的领导同志提出反问：深耕密植不可以改变根的形态生长，由浅而深，由向横方面生长而改变向纵深方面生长么？于是我恍然大悟，所谓“科学根据”，原来是保守思想的反映，从劳动人民的生产实践中，我体会到了人可以改造植物。再深入讨论，过去在封建社会制度之下，农民受地主压迫，生产情绪不高，说不上什么积极性，所以把稻种得浅而稀；今天，在社会主义制度下，农民生产积极性空前提高，因此深耕密植，获得丰收，把稻根亦改了样。这里可以看到社会主义生产关系解放了生产力，亦解放了科学。
    不只农业生产实践方面如此，就是在工业、医务实践方面，在大跃进中亦打破了科学中的保守思想。例如过去科学理论，认为发电机用水冷却是不可能的，而现在却是作到了。在医务工作实践方面，过去认为急性盲肠炎非开刀不可，如今不开刀可以用针灸治疗了，上海在几千病例中有百分之九十几是成功了。这些业务实践，通过科学技术方面的革命，对我们旧知识分子的思想不能不引起改造作用。
    去年的跃进，对知识分子起了这么些思想改造作用，但是或多或少还有些被动的，今年要完成更大的跃进，我们就要主动地继续改造旧思想。因此我个人有这么一个看法，为了祖国的社会主义事业，为了投入今年大跃进，我们必须主动地自觉地不断改造思想，才能继续更好地取得跃进。
    我们今天的大会，是团结的大会，亦是跃进的大会。周总理号召我们，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指导下，紧密地团结起来，用完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的积极行动，来迎接我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国建立的十周年！我一定要以不断改造、更好跃进的积极行动，来响应周总理的号召。
    以上所讲，有不正确地方，请大家予以批评指正。
