Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th. A article published in the British "Daily Herald" on April 8th revealed some information about the brutal persecution of Nyasaland Africans by British colonialists.

The author of the article, John Mossman, revealed the following incident: Less than five weeks ago, near a small post office in Zomba, the seat of the Nyasaland "government," British security forces beat a Nyasaland youth half to death. It is said that this was because he "incited" "government" staff to strike.

He wrote that the British troops did not arrest him, but simply beat him with batons, so severely that even a white man who witnessed the event – a man whose heart had hardened over the years in this "country that persecutes black people" – couldn't bear to watch.

The author wrote that there are many Africans in Nyasaland who have done nothing wrong but have been beaten unconscious or killed by British troops. According to "official" estimates, more than forty Africans have been beaten to death and one hundred injured throughout Nyasaland. But special police recruited from among the white population boasted to him: "The number of people killed is higher than that."

The article said that Nyasaland African National Congress leader Banda and other arrested members of the congress are lying in distant prisons awaiting trial or release – they have been a constant source of embarrassment to the authorities who are still searching for specific details of the "massacre plot."

The article wrote that the people of Nyasaland, seeing the nervous police arbitrarily arresting their leaders and indiscriminately beating and shooting Africans, are all indignant, and thousands upon thousands of them have now gone "underground."

The author wrote that soldiers returning to Salisbury from Nyasaland also told him: "They have hidden away with weapons." The article pointed out that in the northern forests and deep mountains, and in the hot lowlands of Nsanje in the south, thousands of Africans have left their villages, preparing to continue the struggle.

The article said that once the people of Nyasaland stand up, their actions "may become the center of a storm sweeping across the whole of Africa." Referring to the British colonialists' policy of racial discrimination, the article said that in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, Africans are forced to live in special districts several miles from the city. They are not allowed to use the city's buses. They have to use another door to enter and exit post offices and stations. Many large stores only serve Africans through small windows facing the street.

The article finally admitted that in Africa, "everywhere there is a chorus of discontent being voiced by Africans."

### 英国殖民当局的残酷迫害无济于事  尼亚萨兰非洲人转入地下斗争

　　英国殖民当局的残酷迫害无济于事
　　尼亚萨兰非洲人转入地下斗争
    新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：英国“每日先驱报”4月8日发表的一篇文章透露了一些关于英国殖民者残酷迫害尼亚萨兰非洲人的情况。
    文章的作者约翰·莫斯曼透露了这样一个事例：在不到五个星期以前，在尼亚萨兰“政府”所在地松巴的一所小邮政局附近，英国保安部队把一个尼亚萨兰青年打得半死。据说因为他“煽动”“政府”工作人员罢工。
    他写道，英国军队并不逮捕他，而只是用棍棒毒打他，甚至使得看到这件事的一个白人——多年来他在这个“迫害黑人的国家”里心肠变硬了——也看不下去。
    作者写道，在尼亚萨兰有许多非洲人并没有什么过失，而被英国军队打得失去知觉或死去。据“官方”估计，在尼亚萨兰全国，有四十名以上的非洲人被打死，一百人受伤。但是从白人中招募来的特别警察曾经向他夸耀说：“打死的人超过这个数目。”
    文章说，尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会领袖班达和这个大会的其他被捕人员正躺在远方的监狱里等候审讯或释放——他们一直使还在寻找“屠杀阴谋”的具体细节的当局感到狼狈不堪。
    文章写道，尼亚萨兰人看到神经质的警察毫无道理地逮捕他们的领袖，不分青红皂白地殴打和射击非洲人，他们都感到愤怒，他们现在已成千成百地转入“地下”。
    作者写道，从尼亚萨兰回到索耳兹伯里的军队也对他说：“他们带着武器躲起来了。”文章指出，在北部的森林和深山中，在南部的黑勒耳德港炎热的低地，数以千计的非洲人离开了他们的村庄，准备继续斗争。
    文章说，尼亚萨兰人一旦站起来，他们的行动“将可能成为席卷整个非洲的一场暴风雨的中心”。文章在谈到英国殖民者推行种族歧视的政策时说，在南罗得西亚的索耳兹伯里，非洲人不得不住在离城几英里的特别区内。他们不得使用城里的汽车。他们出入邮局和车站都要走另一个门。许多大商店只通过朝街的小窗口为非洲人服务。
    文章最后承认，在非洲，“到处都是非洲人发出的一片不满之声”。
