From the Agricultural Meteorology Perspective: Cotton Planting
Central Meteorological Bureau Agricultural Meteorology Research Office

This year, China will produce 100 million dan of ginned cotton, requiring a yield of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. To accomplish this great task, timely planting and ensuring strong and complete seedlings are very important.

The entire growth period of cotton is about 130 to 250 days, and cotton can be planted in areas with a frost-free period of more than 130 days. The northern boundary of cotton planting in China is around 45 degrees north latitude. The frost-free period in the cotton-growing areas north of the Yellow River is about 140 to 180 days, the Wei River and Huai River basins are about 160 to 210 days, the Yangtze River basin is about 200 to 260 days, and South China is over 300 days. As long as the temperature, moisture, and fertilizer are suitable, cotton can fully utilize the frost-free period to produce more flowers and bolls, thereby increasing ginned cotton production.

However, based on past experience, the shedding of cotton flowers, buds, and bolls is a serious problem, accounting for as much as 70%-80% of the total, with the most severe shedding occurring during periods of heavy rain and overcast weather in summer and autumn. Poor ventilation and light penetration are important factors causing shedding. Ideal cotton-growing locations should have a long frost-free period, sufficient sunlight in summer and autumn, few heavy rain and continuous overcast days, a groundwater level below two meters, and moderate rainfall or irrigation conditions in the plains.

    Solving the Ventilation and Light
    Penetration Problem in Cotton Fields
    Through Dense Planting Methods

Good ventilation and light penetration in cotton fields can reduce the shedding of flowers, buds, and bolls, thereby increasing yield. Experiences in solving this problem during planting and seedling stages are as follows:

Control the number of plants per mu and arrange plant and row spacing according to local conditions. A density of 4,000 to 6,000 plants per mu is generally better. In areas with high altitudes, high latitudes, and high wind speeds and dryness in summer and autumn, denser planting can be used. In areas with less wind and high humidity, appropriate sparse planting can be used. Large row spacing, small plant spacing, and alternating wide and narrow rows are more conducive to ventilation and light penetration. For example, with 4,000 to 6,000 plants per mu, the row spacing should be controlled within 1.8 to 2.1 feet, and the plant spacing within 5 to 7 inches. North-south row orientation is beneficial for light penetration. For good ventilation, the row direction should appropriately face the prevailing wind direction in summer and autumn in each area. Southerly winds are relatively prevalent in China during summer and autumn, so a north-south row arrangement can generally ensure both ventilation and light penetration.

Intercropping cotton with short-stature crops in separate strips. Cotton plants are generally tall and easily shade each other at the bottom. Therefore, intercropping cotton with short-stature crops can largely solve this problem. However, for easy management, it is advisable to intercrop in separate strips, i.e., plant several rows of cotton intercropped with several rows of short-stature crops. Spring potatoes, spring-sown soybeans, and peanuts are all suitable for intercropping with cotton. Sweet potatoes are not suitable for intercropping with cotton because the beet armyworm, which harms sweet potatoes, can intensify the damage to cotton. In areas with high groundwater levels, low-lying and prone to waterlogging, excessive rainfall, or low temperatures, ridge cultivation is best used to facilitate soil aeration, raise soil temperature, and promote cotton development.

        Conditions for Timely Cotton Planting

Cotton is a thermophilic crop. Under suitable moisture conditions, the minimum temperature for seed germination is about 11 degrees Celsius. The main conditions for ensuring complete cotton emergence and strong seedlings are moderate temperature and good moisture before and after emergence. Therefore, the soil temperature at the time of cotton planting should be stable at 12 degrees Celsius or higher at a depth of 5 to 10 centimeters; the best soil moisture content should be 16%-20% of the dry soil weight.

Under these conditions, cotton can emerge in 10 to 15 days after sowing. If the soil moisture is too low, the cotton seeds will not easily expand and germinate, prolonging the emergence period and easily causing uneven emergence. If the soil moisture is too high, the cotton seeds will germinate slowly at slightly lower temperatures and are prone to rot and disease, resulting in a low emergence rate, prolonged emergence period, and severe missing seedlings.

The former North China Academy of Agricultural Sciences pointed out in the 1956 cotton staged planting experiment that early sowing resulted in slow and uneven emergence due to low early spring soil temperature and excessive soil moisture. Late sowing, although resulting in fast and complete emergence due to high temperatures, leads to excessively rapid growth, high first fruiting branch node position, increased internodal distance between fruiting branches, reduced boll formation, and delayed boll opening, resulting in more frost-affected flowers. At the same time, late sowing shortens the cotton plant's growing period, and the plant does not have enough time to grow, reducing both cotton yield and quality.

Because of the short frost-free period in northern cotton-growing areas of China, less spring rainfall, and faster temperature increases, soil moisture is generally not excessive. The masses have already gained the experience of increasing production through timely early sowing of "sowing before frost and emergence after frost." In the North China Plain, Guanzhong Plain, and southern Xinjiang, the end date of late spring frosts is generally around mid-April. In the past, cotton planted in these areas from April 10th to 20th generally had relatively high yields. In northern Xinjiang, western and southeastern Gansu, northern Shaanxi, central Shanxi, and the southern Liao River basin, late frosts generally end around May 5th to 15th, so it is generally better to plant in early May in this area.

The Yangtze River basin has a longer frost-free period and more spring rainfall, and the soil temperature rises slowly. To avoid a large number of flowers and bolls falling off during the plum rain season, it is best to plant cotton after the plum rain season ends in early July. Therefore, applying the northern experience of "sowing before frost and emergence after frost" in the south may not be appropriate. The results of the 1957 "Long Fiber No. 3" sowing date experiment by the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences showed that the highest yield was achieved with sowing around the end of April.

South China has a subtropical climate with few frost days throughout the year, abundant spring and summer rainfall (less rainfall in July), and typhoon damage in summer and autumn. In the past, cotton was rarely planted. In the new cotton-growing areas this year, the earliest sowing period can be in early to mid-March, and the latest can be in early May. The climate of Hainan Island is unique in South China. There are no frosts all year round, and the average temperature is generally above 15 degrees Celsius. Most areas (especially the southwest of the island) generally have little rainfall from November to early July of the following year, and there are not many typhoons. The period with the most rainfall and typhoons is from mid-July to October. To take advantage of the superior meteorological conditions for cotton boll formation in this area, areas with irrigation conditions can experiment with planting cotton in December of the previous year, so that the flowering to boll opening period is in the clear and dry season from March to early July, minimizing flower and bud drop, increasing boll setting rate, and extending the boll opening period, thereby achieving high yields.

China's cotton-growing areas are vast and have complex climatic conditions. The above analysis can only serve as a reference for various regions to determine cotton planting dates based on local experience. Before planting cotton, it is best to refer to the "ten-day weather forecast." If the forecast indicates heavy rain in the next few days after sowing, it may be better to postpone planting until after the rain to avoid soil compaction caused by heavy rain, which can make it difficult for cotton seedlings to emerge.

    从农业气象谈棉花播种
    中央气象局农业气象研究室
    今年我国将生产皮棉一亿担，要求亩产皮棉达一百斤以上。为了完成这个伟大的任务，适时播种、保证苗壮苗全，是一个很重要的问题。
    棉花整个生育期长约一百三十到二百五十天，全年无霜期在一百三十天以上的地区都可以植棉。我国植棉的北界约在北纬四十五度左右。黄河以北棉区无霜期约一百四十到一百八十天，渭河与淮河流域约一百六十到二百一十天，长江流域约二百到二百六十天，华南地区在三百天以上。只要气温、水分和肥分施的适宜，棉花可以充分利用无霜期多显花、多结桃，从而增加皮棉产量。
    但是，从过去的经验看来，棉花的花、蕾、铃的脱落是严重问题，脱落最多可占总数的70％—80％，在夏秋多暴雨和阴雨天气脱落最严重。通风透光条件差是引起脱落的重要因素。优良的植棉地点最好是无霜期长，夏秋日光充足，暴雨和连阴雨天气少，并且地下水位在二公尺以下，同时雨水适中或有灌溉条件的平原地带。
    从密植方式上解决
      棉田通风透光问题
    棉田通风透光问题解决得好，就可以减少花、蕾、铃的脱落，从而增加产量。在播种和苗期解决这个问题的经验如下：
    因地制宜控制株数和安排株行距。棉花株数以每亩四千到六千株较好，地势高、纬度高以及夏秋风速较大并较为干燥的地区，可密植一些，风少、湿度大的地区可适当稀植一些。行距大，株距小，宽窄行相间都更有利于通风透光。如每亩株数四千到六千株，则行距宜控制在一点八到二点一尺，株距五到七寸之内。南北行向利于透光。为了通风好，应根据各地夏秋的盛行风向使行向适当地迎着风向。我国夏秋偏南风比较盛行，因此行向的南北向排列一般是能同时兼顾通风与透光的。
    棉花和矮生作物分厢间作。棉花植株一般比较高大，容易使下部互相荫蔽，因此使棉花和矮生作物间作，就能在很大的程度上解决这个问题。但为了管理方便，以分厢间作，即种几行棉花间作几行矮生作物为宜。春马铃薯、春播大豆以及花生等矮生作物均可同棉花间作。甘薯不宜同棉花间作，因为危害甘薯的斜纹夜蛾能加强对棉花的为害。在地下水位高、低洼易涝、雨水过多或温度较低的地区，最好采用垅作，以便利于土壤透气，提高地温，促进棉花发育。
        棉花适期播种的条件
    棉花是一种喜温作物。在适宜的水分条件下，种子发芽的最低温度在摄氏十一度左右。保证棉花出苗齐全、苗期健壮的主要条件是出苗前后温度适中、水分良好。因此，棉花播种时的地下温度，以五至十厘米深处的地温稳定在摄氏十二度以后为宜；土壤水分，以水分占干土重的16％—20％最好。
    在这些条件下，棉花在播后十到十五天即可出苗。如果土壤水分太少，棉籽不易膨胀发芽，使出苗期延长，容易造成出苗不齐；如土壤水分过多，在温度稍低的情况下，棉籽发芽慢，容易腐烂和遭受病害，使得出苗率小，出苗期延长，缺苗断垅严重。
    前华北农科所在1956年棉花分期播种的试验结果指出，过早播种，出苗慢而不整齐，其原因是由于早春地温低、土壤湿度过大的结果。播种过迟，温度高，虽然出苗快而齐全，但因为生长过快，第一果枝着生部位高，果枝之间的节间距离增长，减少结桃，吐絮期后延，因而霜后花增多；同时，由于播种过晚，棉株生长期缩短，植株没有充分的生长时间，棉花产量与质量都要降低。
    我国北方棉区因为无霜期短，春季雨水少，温度升高较快，土壤水分一般都不会过大，群众已经取得“霜前播种，霜后出苗”的适时早播的增产经验。华北平原、关中平原以及新疆南部晚霜冻结束日期一般在4月中旬前后，过去这些地区在4月10日到20日播种的棉花，产量一般都是比较高的。新疆北部、甘肃西部和东南部、陕西北部、山西中部以及辽河流域南部，晚霜冻大致在5月5日到15日结束，故常年这个地区以在5月上旬播种较好。
    长江流域无霜期较长，春季雨水多，地温缓慢升高，为避免梅雨期间大量落花落铃，棉花最好在7月上旬梅雨结束以后开花。因此把北方“霜前播种，霜后出苗”的经验在南方运用就不见得恰当。华东农科所1957年对“长绒3号”播种期试验的结果，以4月底前后播种产量最高。
    华南地区系亚热带气候，全年有霜日数很少，春夏雨多（7月雨水较少），夏秋有台风为害。往年极少种棉，今年新开棉区播种期最早可在3月上、中旬，最迟可到5月上旬。海南岛的气候在华南地区是特殊的，终年都不会有霜冻，平均气温一般都在摄氏十五度以上，大部地区（尤其是岛的西南部）从11月到第二年7月上旬一般降水少，台风次数不多；降水和台风最多的时期是7月中旬到10月份。为了利用这个地区对棉花成桃的优越气象条件，有灌溉条件的地区可以试验在头年12月播种棉花，以便让开花到吐絮的时期都在3至7月上旬的晴朗、干燥的季节，尽量减少落花落蕾，增加成桃率，延长吐絮期，从而达到高额丰收。
    我国棉区广大，气候条件复杂，以上分析只能作为各地根据当地经验决定棉花播种期的参考。各地在棉花播种以前，最好参考“十天天气预报”，如预报播种以后几天内有大雨，则不妨改在雨后播种，以免大雨引起土壤板结，造成棉苗出土困难。
