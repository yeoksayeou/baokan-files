　　Assigning Leading Cadres and Training Teachers
　　Shenyang Rectifies Newly Established Institutions of Higher Education
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 13th. Newly established institutions of higher education in Shenyang are actively adopting measures to carry out rectification and consolidation work.

    Last year, the number of higher education institutions in Shenyang increased from eight to twenty-five, including various types such as engineering, agriculture, forestry, medicine, and teacher training; the number of students enrolled increased from more than 18,300 to 31,100.

    In order to consolidate these newly established institutions, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has equipped many schools with necessary cadres such as Party committee secretaries and general branch secretaries for departments, presidents (deans), academic deans, and heads of sections (departments), and has rationally arranged teaching, productive labor, and scientific research work. At the same time, the Liaoning Provincial Committee and the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have universally attached importance to the training and improvement of teachers in various newly established institutions. Under the leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees, these newly established institutions have adopted methods such as sending teachers to fraternal institutions for advanced studies, collective lesson preparation within the school, experienced teachers guiding new teachers, and organizing teachers to observe teaching in their own schools or in fraternal institutions to improve the teaching level of the teachers in the schools. Shenyang Normal College has been supported by the provincial education department and Liaoning University with twenty-eight teachers, which can basically solve the problem of teacher rotation training. Now this school has transferred ten teachers to Beijing Normal University, Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, Jilin University and other institutions for further studies, and has adopted collective lesson preparation, "teaching and learning at the same time" and other methods within the school to improve the teaching level of new teachers. Shenyang Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering has selected seven teachers to go to fraternal institutions in Beijing and other places for advanced studies.

    In order to better integrate teaching with productive labor, the newly established institutions in Shenyang have recently rectified the school-run factories. Shenyang Institute of Building Materials Industry, Shenyang Institute of Chemical Technology and other schools, according to the characteristics of their majors and the needs of teaching work, have also established and revised relevant factory production plans and organizational leadership, student labor performance appraisal methods, etc., so that productive labor is closely integrated with the students' majors.

　　配备领导干部培养训练教师
　　沈阳整顿新建高等学校
    新华社沈阳13日电　沈阳市新建高等学校正在积极采取措施，进行整顿巩固工作。
    去年，沈阳市高等学校由八所发展到二十五所，包括工科、农科、林科、医学、师范等不同类型；在校学生由一万八千三百多人增加到三万一千一百人。
    为了巩固这些新建院校，中共沈阳市委为许多学校配备了院校党委书记和系的总支书记、校（院）长、教务长、科（系）主任等必要干部，合理地安排了教学、生产劳动和科学研究工作。与此同时，中共辽宁省委和沈阳市委还普遍重视了各新建院校的师资培养和提高工作。在省、市党委领导下，这些新办院校采取了选派教师到兄弟院校进修、校内集体备课、老教师带新教师、组织教师在校内或到兄弟院校进行教学观摩等方法，提高在校教师的教学水平。沈阳师范学院由省教育部门和辽宁大学支援了二十八名教师，基本上能解决师资轮训的问题。现在这个学校已抽调了十名教师，分别到北京师范大学、北京外国语学院和吉林大学等院校进修，在校内则采取集体备课、“边教边学”等办法，提高新教师的教学水平。沈阳机电学院选派七名教师到北京等地兄弟院校进修。
    为了使教学更好地和生产劳动相结合，沈阳市各新建院校最近都对校办工厂进行了整顿。沈阳建筑材料工业学院、沈阳化工学院等校根据专业的特点和教学工作的需要，还分别建立和修订有关工厂的生产规划和组织领导、学生劳动成绩考核等办法，使生产劳动紧密地结合学生所学专业进行。
