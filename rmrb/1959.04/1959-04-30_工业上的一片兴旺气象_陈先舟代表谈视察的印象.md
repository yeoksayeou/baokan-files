Comrades and Representatives,

I have listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959, as well as Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I believe these reports are all very correct, and I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support them, and I am willing to earnestly follow these instructions in my future work and strive to implement them.

Before this conference, I inspected the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, Machine Tool Plant No. 1, High-Voltage Switch Plant, Mining Machinery Plant, Transformer Plant, Cable Plant, the local state-owned Shenyang Electric Motor Plant, and the jointly state-private Shenyang Third Electrical Machinery Plant, among others, in Shenyang. Based on my immature understanding, I will talk about the Great Leap Forward in industry and the participation of cadres in labor, workers in management, and the "three-way combination" of leading personnel, technical personnel, and worker masses. I ask for your corrections, representatives.

From this inspection, I have gained a more concrete and profound understanding that China's industrial front, like other fronts, is undergoing a comprehensive Great Leap Forward, and the achievements made are unprecedented and historically great. The plans of various factories for this year and the facts of the leap forward in the first quarter of this year prove that 1959 will be a year of even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than 1958. Upon entering the factory gate, one immediately feels the flourishing atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward in our factories. In the courtyards of the factories, finished and semi-finished products are piled up like mountains, even along the roads near the factories. Is this due to poor management? No. It is because the Great Leap Forward has transformed one factory into two, or even more, factories, so the warehouses are not large enough, and the factory land seems narrow. Looking at the sky-high enthusiasm and the vigorous vitality of the worker comrades, one cannot help but feel unspeakably happy. They are filled with joyful and excited moods, expressing revolutionary optimism, using their brains and hands, and engaging in a tense battle to accelerate the socialist construction that they love so dearly, with courage and resourcefulness. Good news from daily, weekly, and ten-day competitions in various factories is constantly broadcast from the broadcasting stations. Their contest platforms stand solemnly everywhere in the factory courtyards, workshops, and groups, and their spirit of learning from the advanced, competing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced is clearly manifested on the contest platforms. For example, the design level of Shenyang Machine Tool Plant No. 1 was an annual output of 2,200 units. The actual production in 1957 was 2,500 units. In 1958, after several revisions of the plan, it was finally set at 5,000 units, and the actual completion was 5,035 units, more than doubling the output of 1957. Due to the large-scale mass movement and the vigorous technical revolution, from March to October of last year alone, the plant's employees proposed more than 9,000 important innovation suggestions, an increase of eleven and a half times compared to 1957. At the same time, they successfully trial-produced 27 new products, an increase of more than four times compared to 1957, and 14 more than the total amount of the first Five-Year Plan. Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant produced 18,400 tons in 1958, while in the first quarter of this year, it produced 5,225 tons. The plant used to produce three or four coal washing machines per month. This year, the plant is a "Five Guarantees" household among the "Six Guarantees" households (i.e., guaranteeing the completion of six major equipment tasks). Due to the full mobilization of the masses and the innovation of technology, it produced 80 coal washing machines in the first two months of the first quarter. This kind of leap forward situation is truly amazing! In order to complete the tasks assigned by the state, from March 1st to March 10th, the plant's employees proposed more than 1,000 rationalization proposals for improving equipment, improving tools, and improving technological operations in just ten days, ensuring the completion of the first quarter's production task of 5,225 tons. For innovation projects, some used to take 25 minutes, now reduced to 4 minutes, and some used to take half an hour each, now changed to 100 in three hours. In casting, some have increased efficiency by 29 times. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant is now widely mobilizing the masses and vigorously carrying out the "Double Leap Forward (ideological and production) 'Thousand-Hour' Red Flag Competition" centered on the technical revolution in order to complete its tasks, thereby greatly promoting production and improving production efficiency. Many machine tools have exceeded the "Thousand-Hour" target, with some reaching as high as 2,500 hours. In terms of new products, a 750mm primary rolling mill and a four-roll silicon steel sheet cold rolling mill have been successfully manufactured. Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Plant, through vigorously carrying out technical revolution, made 30 indigenous equipment in three months, completing the first quarter's production plan two days ahead of schedule and exceeding it by 17 percent.

Why were we able to achieve such unprecedented leap forward achievements on the industrial front in 1958? Why did we achieve an even greater leap forward in the first quarter of 1959 than in 1958? As Premier Zhou pointed out in the Government Work Report, this appeared on the basis of the victory of the socialist revolution and the completion of the first Five-Year Plan in China; it appeared after the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts; it appeared under the brilliant illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in the spring of 1958 after summarizing the experience of the first Five-Year Plan. It also demonstrates the unparalleled superiority and powerful vitality of our socialist system. All of the above correctly reflect the objective laws of our socialist construction, and also reflect that our subjective understanding conforms to objective laws. Any doubts about our industrial Great Leap Forward are incorrect.

During the inspection, countless facts proved that the factory that thoroughly implemented the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" and put politics in command had high mass enthusiasm, the technical revolution and technical innovation were carried out vigorously, and the production tasks were completed excellently. Although the implementation was not balanced in all factories, it has already played its excellent role in the industrial Great Leap Forward. During the inspection, when I talked with worker comrades, they reflected that worker participation in enterprise management was regarded as the party and the state’s trust in them; at the same time, it is also the glorious responsibility of the leading class. Therefore, their sense of responsibility as masters has been greatly strengthened, and their enthusiasm for production has become even higher. Some workshop employees have spontaneously set up "amateur factories" during rest hours. The democratic management groups in various factories are like this: some have developed from production management to technical management; some have developed from production management and technical management to economic accounting.

After cadres participated in production, the relationship between leaders and the led was further improved, and the ideological style of being divorced from the masses to varying degrees was overcome, so that problems could be discovered and solved in a timely manner. In some factories, after cadres participated in production, workers wrote on big-character posters: "In the past, cadres had a big air, and didn't talk to workers when they saw them; after cadres participated in labor, workers' hearts blossomed, sharing joys and hardships and working together, helping each other like a family." The important significance of cadres participating in production has been correctly evaluated by the workers' big-character posters.

After rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, especially after participating in productive labor, engineering and technical personnel underwent great changes in their thinking and made great progress in politics. At the same time, it is also of great help to their future continued and in-depth fundamental transformation of politics and ideology. For example, their common characteristics in the past were four beliefs and four disbeliefs, namely: (1) believing in things but not in people; (2) believing in books but not in practice; (3) believing in foreign but not in domestic; (4) believing in specialists but not in the masses. That is, dealing with practical problems with old eyes and old experience, always thinking more and doing less, willing to be teachers but not willing to be students, unwilling to break the rules, always "stable and steady." After more than a year of practice, there has been great improvement in these areas. Of course, it cannot be said that they have now been transformed well and no longer need to be transformed in the future. Premier Zhou's report is very correct: "All old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-transformation in their long-term work practice in the future."

These effective methods are also being continuously and deeply implemented in various factories. From the implementation, it can be seen that democratic management groups must be done well. How can they be done well? The key lies in resolutely implementing the leadership of the Party. The Party branch and group must strengthen unified leadership over the administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League groups, and at the same time, there must be a clear division of labor. Truly achieve "unified leadership, individual responsibility, everyone's participation, and close cooperation." The Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League play the role of each organization under the leadership of the Party.

The "three-way combination" is the combination of leading cadres of the Party, engineering and technical personnel, and the worker masses. Practice has proved that this is the best way to specifically implement the Party's leadership and mass line, and it is also the best form of combining politics in command, science and technology, and production experience. In particular, engineering and technical personnel can often and specifically accept the Party's leadership and learn from the workers, so that service and transformation are combined and promote each other. Gradual transformation in on-the-job work practice is also the best way to combine mental and physical labor. At the same time, it can fully transmit information from above to below and from below to above. In this way, problems can be discovered in a timely manner through lively and practical discussions, and specific solutions can be found, which is also a method of working with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The example of the Baoji Baocheng Instrument Factory in Baoji City, introduced in Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1959, fully proves the superior role of the three-way combination in industrial production. The three-way combination situation in the factories I inspected is also diverse, with factory-level three-way combinations, workshop-level three-way combinations, and democratic management group-level three-way combinations. The names are different, and the development is also uneven. They should be vigorously consolidated and improved in the future. If the three-way combination is well implemented, it will definitely play its superior role in carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement, vigorously engaging in technical revolution, and vigorously launching mass movements on the industrial front. Therefore, it should be well implemented.

In addition, regarding the issue of giving full play to the potential of enterprises and the collaboration of various factories, has the potential of each factory been fully tapped now? Analyzing and comparing the situation of the factories I inspected shows that large factories still have great potential. Therefore, we should greatly tap potential on the basis of existing equipment and give full play to the backbone role of large factories. Regarding the issue of collaboration, there has been great achievement in collaboration between various factories, but according to several examples reflected in the symposium, collaboration must be further strengthened in the future, learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses, in order to jointly complete and overfulfill the even more magnificent leap forward tasks of 1959.

Representatives, when I saw the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials in Tezpur, India, in the newspaper, it aroused my unparalleled indignation.

The Tibetan rebels, colluding with imperialist and Indian expansionist elements, in the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama," actually talked about shameful and absurd fallacies such as Tibetan independence. They are too delusional and too stupid. Tibet is an inalienable part of China's sacred territory, and the Tibetan people are members of China's national family. This iron historical fact will never be changed by the fabrication of lies and fallacies by this small group of rebels. In addition, do they want to rely on imperialist forces to impose it on the Chinese people? Obviously, it is impossible. The Chinese people have stood up under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. The era of imperialism bullying the Chinese people is gone forever. China is no longer the "sick man of East Asia" but a giant dragon of the East. They are not assessing their own abilities, not measuring their own strength, and wasting their efforts. This small group of rebels is carrying out its sinister actions of selling out national interests and undermining religion under the guise of maintaining religion. They attempt to turn Tibet into an imperialist colony and rely on imperialist forces to maintain their dark and inhuman serf system, forever enslaving and exploiting the Tibetan people. This is absolutely intolerable to the people of all ethnic groups in our country, including the Tibetan people and the patriotic figures of the middle and upper classes in Tibet. The future of this small group of rebels is nothing but trying to stop a chariot with a mantis's arm, destroying themselves. - The Tibetan rebels betrayed the motherland, undermined the unity of the motherland and the unity of the nation, and are not tolerated by national law. The government has ordered the dissolution of the original Tibetan local government and the exercise of local functions by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which is completely correct.

Just as our troops stationed in Tibet and the Tibetan monks and lay people were ordered to quell the rebels, unexpectedly, India, our neighboring country that pursues the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, actually distributed the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" by Indian diplomatic officials themselves. This clearly shows that the Indian government supports the criminal activities of the Tibetan rebels. At the same time, some Indian politicians have repeatedly expressed "sympathy" for the Tibetan rebels, and recently even more blatantly said that Nehru has "fatherly feelings" for the Dalai Lama. Can these activities and expressions of Indian diplomatic officials and some politicians show that they are acting in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and maintaining Sino-Indian friendship? It can only be said that it is beneficial to imperialism. For China, it is not truly pursuing the Five Principles and maintaining Sino-Indian friendship, but interference in China's internal affairs. If they sincerely want to maintain Sino-Indian friendship, they must immediately change this erroneous attitude. Remind Mr. Indian politicians to be more sober and more rational, and do not妄想混水摸鱼，作茧自缚 (attempt to fish in troubled waters and weave a cocoon around themselves). We must protect the unity of the motherland, consolidate the unity of the nation, and work with the Tibetan people to build a prosperous, strong, and happy new Tibet. Let the rebels, imperialist elements, and Indian expansionist elements dream their daydreams!

Comrades! In 1958, we achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements in the Great Leap Forward, and in the short few months of the first quarter of 1959, we have achieved extraordinary results. This has laid a good foundation for a greater leap forward in 1959. In order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the grand plan for developing the national economy in 1959, and to consolidate our national defense, the leadership of the Party is the first of a thousand and ten thousand条 (measures), and the mass line is the first of a thousand and ten thousand计 (strategies). Let us unite closely around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, launch mass movements on a large scale, vigorously engage in technical revolution, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, hold high the red flag, sing songs of triumph, make persistent efforts, and advance bravely!

    工业上的一片兴旺气象
    陈先舟代表谈视察的印象各位代表：
    我听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理的关于一九五九年度国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告以及彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。我认为这些报告都非常正确，我完全同意和衷心拥护，并愿在今后工作中，切实遵循这些指示而努力贯彻执行。
    在这次大会之前，我在沈阳视察了沈阳重型机器厂、机床一厂、高压开关厂、矿山机器厂、变压器厂、电缆厂、地方国营沈阳电机厂和公私合营沈阳第三电工机械厂等单位。仅就我不成熟的体会，谈谈有关工业上的大跃进和关于干部参加劳动，工人参加管理以及领导人员、技术人员、工人群众三结合的情况，请各位代表指正。
    从这次视察中，更具体、更深刻地认识到我国工业战线和其他战线一样，是一个全面大跃进，所得的成就是空前伟大的，史无前例的。从各个工厂今年的计划和今年第一季度跃进的事实，证明了一九五九年比一九五八年是更大更好更全面跃进的一年。一进工厂大门，就突出地感觉到我们工厂大跃进的兴旺气象，各工厂的院子里，成品、半成品堆积如山，甚至在工厂附近的马路两旁都摆满了。这是否管理的不好呢？不是的。是因为大跃进，把一个工厂变成两个工厂，以至于两个以上的工厂，所以，仓库不够用，工厂用地显得狭窄了。再看看工人同志们的冲天干劲，生龙活虎般的朝气，使人感到有说不出来的高兴。他们洋溢着愉快兴奋的心情，表现着革命乐观主义精神，在动脑动手，紧张的为加速自己无比热爱的社会主义建设，有勇有谋地进行着战斗。各个工厂的日竞赛、周竞赛和旬竞赛等捷报不断从广播台传出。他们的比武台，在厂院里、车间里、小组里到处庄严的峙立着，他们的学先进、比先进、赶先进的劲头，在比武台上明显地表现出来了。如沈阳第一机床厂的设计水平是年产二千二百台，一九五七年实际生产二千五百台，一九五八年经过几次地修订计划，最后定为五千台，实际完成了五千零三十五台，超过一九五七年产量一倍多。由于大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，仅去年三月至十月，全厂职工提出重要革新建议九千多件，比一九五七年增加十一倍半；同时，又试制成功了二十七种新产品，比一九五七年增加四倍多，比第一个五年计划的总额还多十四种。沈阳矿山机器厂，一九五八年年产量一万八千四百吨，而今年第一季度就生产五千二百二十五吨，该厂过去每月生产三、四台洗煤机，今年该厂为“六保”户（即保证完成六大设备任务）中的“五保”户，由于群众发动的充分，革新了技术，在第一季度的两个月中，就生产八十台洗煤机，这种跃进情况真是惊人！该厂职工为完成国家给的任务，从三月一日到三月十日仅十天时间，就提出改进设备、改进工具和工艺操作的合理化建议一千多条，保证了第一季度完成五千二百二十五吨的生产任务。革新项目，有的过去二十五分钟，现在减到四分钟，有的过去半小时一个，现在改为三小时一百个。铸造方面，有的提高效率二十九倍。沈阳重型机器厂，他们为了完成任务，现在正广泛地发动群众，大力开展以技术革命为中心的“双跃进（思想、生产）‘千台时’红旗竞赛运动”，从而大大地促进了生产，提高了生产效率，许多机床超过了“千台时”的指标，有的最高达到二千五百小时。在新产品方面，七百五十公厘初轧机和四辊矽钢片冷轧机已制造成功。沈阳高压开关厂，通过大搞技术革命，三个月中，共制成土设备三十台，提前两天并超额百分之十七完成了今年第一季度生产计划。
    我们为什么能够在一九五八年工业战线上取得这样空前跃进的辉煌成就呢？为什么一九五九年第一季度又取得比一九五八年更大的跃进呢？正如周总理在政府工作报告中所指出，这是在我国社会主义革命胜利和第一个五年计划完成的基础上出现的，是在经济战线、政治战线、思想战线的社会主义革命取得胜利之后出现的；是党中央和毛主席在一九五八年春季总结了第一个五年计划的经验，制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下出现的。同时也显示了我们社会主义制度无比的优越性和强大的生命力。以上这些都是正确地反映了我们社会主义建设的客观规律，也反映了我们的主观认识符合了客观规律。对于我们工业上大跃进，存有任何怀疑都是不对的。
    在视察中，无数事实证明了：关于两参、一改、三结合，那个工厂贯彻的深透，政治挂帅，那个工厂的群众积极性就高涨，技术革命和技术革新就开展得蓬蓬勃勃，而生产任务就完成的出色。各个工厂虽然贯彻的不够平衡。但是在工业大跃进中已经发挥了它的优异作用。我在视察中，同工人同志们座谈时，他们反映工人参加企业管理，认为这是党和国家对他们的信任；同时，也是领导阶级的光荣责任。所以，他们主人翁责任感大大加强了，因此，生产积极性更加高涨，有的车间职工在休息时间，自动办起了“业余工厂”。各厂的民主管理小组是这样：有的由生产管理发展到技术管理；有的由生产管理、技术管理发展到经济核算。
    干部参加生产后，进一步改善了领导与被领导关系，克服了不同程度的脱离群众的思想作风，从而能够及时地发现问题，解决问题。有的工厂，干部参加生产后，工人在大字报上写道：“从前干部架子大，见了工人不说话；干部参加劳动后，工人心里开了花，同甘共苦同劳动，互相帮助是一家。”干部参加生产的重要意义，工人的大字报已作了正确的评价。
    工程技术人员，在经过整风和反右斗争，特别是参加生产劳动后，思想上起了很大变化，政治上有了很大进步。同时，对他们今后继续深入地进行政治和思想的根本改造也有很大帮助。如他们过去共同特点是四信四不信，即：（1）信物不信人；（2）信书不信实；（3）信洋不信土；（4）信专（家）不信群（众）。就是以老的眼光，老的经验对待现实问题，总是想的多做的少，愿当先生，不愿作学生，不愿打破常规，老是“四平八稳”。经过这一年多的实践，在这些方面有很大的克服。当然，还不能说他们现在已经改造好了，今后不需要改造了。周总理报告中说的非常正确：“一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造”。
    这些有效的方法，各厂也都在继续深入的贯彻中。从贯彻当中看到民主管理小组必须搞好。如何才能搞好呢？关键在于坚决贯彻党的领导。党支部和小组必须对行政、工会、青年团小组加强统一领导，同时还要有明确分工。真正做到“统一领导、个人负责、大家动手、密切配合”。党、政、工、团四方面，在党的领导下发挥各个组织的作用。
    “三结合”是党的领导干部、工程技术人员和工人群众的结合。实践证明，这是具体地贯彻党的领导和群众路线最好的方法，也是政治挂帅、科学技术和生产经验结合的最好形式。尤其是工程技术人员，能够经常的具体的接受党的领导，向工人学习，使服务与改造互相结合，互相促进。在岗位工作实践中，逐步进行改造，也是脑力劳动和体力劳动结合的最好的方法。同时能使上情充分下达，下情充分上达。这样，就能通过活泼的、切实的讨论，及时发现问题，找到解决问题的具体办法，这也是多快好省的工作方法。李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告中所介绍的宝鸡市宝成仪表厂的实例，完全证明三结合在工业生产上的优越作用。我所视察的各工厂的三结合的情况也是多种多样的，有厂级的三结合，有车间级的三结合，有民主管理小组级的三结合，名称不一样，发展也不平衡，今后应大力地加以巩固、提高。三结合贯彻的好，对于在工业战线上开展增产节约运动，大闹技术革命、大搞群众运动，一定能够发挥它的优越作用。因此应该很好地贯彻执行。
    另外，关于发挥企业潜力和各厂协作问题，现在是不是各厂的潜力已挖掘到顶点了呢？从我视察的各厂情况加以分析比较，就看出大型工厂还有很大的潜力，因此，应在现有设备基础上大大地挖掘潜力，发挥大型厂的骨干作用。对于协作问题，各厂之间在协作方面，是有很大的成就，但是根据座谈会上反映的几个实例看，今后在协作上还必须再加强一步，取长补短、互通有无，以便共同完成和超额完成一九五九年的更为宏伟的跃进任务。
    各位代表，当我在报上看到在印度的提斯浦尔经由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”之后，激起我无比的愤慨。
    西藏叛乱分子勾结帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，在所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中，竟大谈西藏独立等可耻的谎谬谰言，他们太想入非非了，也太愚蠢了。西藏是我国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，西藏人民是我国民族大家庭中的一员，这种铁的历史事实，绝不会由于他们这一小撮叛乱分子捏造谎言、谬论就可以改变的，另外他们想依靠帝国主义势力强加在中国人民头上行不行呢？显然是不行的。中国人民已经在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下站起来了。帝国主义欺侮中国人民的时代已经一去不复返了。中国已不是“东亚病夫”而是东方巨龙。他们是不度德、不量力、枉费心机。这一小撮叛乱分子，是打着维护宗教的幌子，实行其出卖民族利益和破坏宗教的罪恶勾当。他们企图把西藏变为帝国主义殖民地，依靠帝国主义力量维持其黑暗的惨无人道的农奴制度，永远奴役剥削西藏人民。这是我们全国各族人民、包括西藏人民和西藏的中上层爱国人士所绝对不能容忍的。这一小撮叛乱分子的前途没有别的，就是螳臂当车，自己毁灭自己。——西藏叛乱分子背叛祖国，破坏祖国的统一和民族的团结，为国法所不容。政府已经命令解散原西藏地方政府；由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方职权，这是完全正确的。
    正当我驻西藏部队和西藏僧俗人民奉命平息叛乱分子时，不料，奉行和平共处五项原则的我们邻邦印度，竟将所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，由印度外交官员亲自散发，这显然说明印度官方是支持西藏叛乱分子的罪恶活动的。同时，印度某些政治家，又一再表示“同情”西藏叛乱分子，最近更露骨的说什么尼赫鲁对达赖是有“父亲般的感情”。印度外交官员和某些政治家的这些活动和表示能说明是本着和平共处五项原则、维持中印友谊吗？这只能说是对于帝国主义有利。对于中国则不是真正奉行五项原则，保持中印友谊。而是对中国内政的干涉。如果真正诚意愿意保持中印友谊，就必须立即改变这种错误态度。提醒印度政治家先生们，要清醒一些，理智一些，不要妄想混水摸鱼，作茧自缚。我们一定要保护祖国的统一，巩固民族的团结，同西藏人民一起，建设繁荣、昌盛、幸福的新西藏。让叛乱分子、帝国主义分子和印度的扩张主义分子白日作梦吧！
    同志们！一九五八年已取得了史无前例的大跃进的辉煌成就，在一九五九年第一季度的短短几个月里，又取得了非凡的成绩。这就为一九五九年更大的跃进打下了良好的基础。为保证完成和超额完成一九五九年发展国民经济的宏伟计划，为巩固我们的国防、千条万条党的领导是第一条，千计万计群众路线是第一计。让我们紧紧地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，高举红旗，高唱凯歌，再接再厉，奋勇前进吧！
