Xinhua News Agency Report: To meet the needs of the great leap forward in agriculture on state-owned farms and to support the people's communes, state-owned farms in the Mishan and Hejiang reclamation areas of Heilongjiang are giving full play to the superiority of socialist public ownership and are establishing fine seed breeding base networks to vigorously cultivate and propagate fine seeds.

In recent years, while reclaiming wasteland and building farms on a large scale, the Hejiang and Mishan reclamation areas have introduced many fine varieties of crops. Through trial planting and production practice, they have propagated and promoted in large quantities the fine varieties suitable for local cultivation. Farms that have been established for a long time have popularized fine seeds and supplied a large number of seeds to newly built farms, which has played a significant role in promoting the development of the agricultural reclamation cause. However, due to the large amount of wasteland reclamation and rapid development in the two reclamation areas, seed work has not kept up with the needs of production development. At the same time, in order to better support the nearby people's communes, faster development of fine seed propagation work is required. Recently, the Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation held an on-site meeting on seed work for state-owned farms in the Mishan and Hejiang reclamation areas at the Youyi Farm. The meeting formulated a plan for the development of fine seeds in the two reclamation areas: in 1959, the area of seed fields will reach 700,000 mu, and it is planned to propagate 340 million jin of fine seeds of various crops such as soybeans, wheat, corn, and rice. Among them, 80 million jin will be new varieties and reserve varieties, accounting for about 23%. In addition to the self-use of the two reclamation areas, 40 million jin of fine seeds can also be transferred to support newly built farms and nearby people's communes.

In order to ensure the thorough implementation of the fine seed development plan, the Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation, in light of the actual conditions of the two reclamation areas, revised the specific plan for establishing a fine seed breeding base network. Based on the distribution of farms and the characteristics of soil and climate, it was decided to establish fine seed breeding experimental farms in ten regions in the two reclamation areas; each general farm will establish twenty-five fine seed breeding experimental stations; each sub-farm will establish one hundred and twenty-one fine seed teams; and each production team will set up seed groups to establish seed fields. Taking the regional fine seed farm as the center, a systematic fine seed breeding base network is formed. The tasks of the fine seed farm are mainly to produce original seeds, and to be responsible for the introduction of seeds, variety experiments, cultivation experiments, and the cultivation of new varieties; the fine seed station is responsible for expanding the propagation of original seeds and conducting regional adaptability identification of varieties; the fine seed team is responsible for propagating the seeds of the seed fields of each production team, or directly supplying the seeds needed for large fields. The establishment of such a systematic fine seed breeding system lays the foundation for the realization of regular replacement of new varieties and the continuous improvement of seed work.

The fine seed propagation fields of each farm in the two reclamation areas generally adopt a three-level system, that is, the fine seed station takes the original seeds from the fine seed farm to propagate the first generation of original seeds, the fine seed team propagates the second generation of original seeds, and the seed field of the production team propagates the seeds for the large fields. As for the excellent varieties that are to be cultivated and propagated in large quantities this year, soybeans include Mancangjin, Dongfeng No. 1, Jingshanpu, and Heilongjiang No. 41; wheat includes Hezuo No. 5, No. 2, and Gansu No. 96; rice includes Hezuo No. 1, No. 3, Hongmang, and Xiaobaimao; and corn includes Hongyangzi and Baitoushuang.

Now, in order to ensure that the plan is implemented, the state-owned farms in the two reclamation areas have taken active action. For example, the 850 Farm of the Mishan Reclamation Bureau has allocated more than 15,000 mu as a fine seed base, of which 3,700 mu are used to propagate original seeds. In order to enable the fine seed work to develop rapidly, the farm has allocated 130 tons of phosphate fertilizer and a large number of cultivation and sowing machines. It has also established a special seed warehouse and cement drying ground, added many instruments, and established a research office.

　　密山、合江垦区建立良种繁育网
    计划今年繁殖大豆等良种三亿多斤
    据新华社讯　为了满足国营农场农业大跃进的需要和支援人民公社，黑龙江密山、合江两垦区各国营农场充分发挥全民所有制的优越性，正在建立良种繁育基地网，大力培育和繁殖良种。
    合江、密山两垦区几年来在大量开荒建场的同时，引进了不少农作物的优良品种，通过试种和生产实践，把适于当地栽培的优良品种，大量繁殖推广。建立时间较久的农场已经普及了良种，并供应了新建场大批种子，对促进农垦事业的发展起了很大作用。但由于两个垦区开荒多，发展快，种子工作还跟不上生产发展的需要。同时为了更好地支援附近的人民公社，就要求繁殖良种工作有更快的发展。最近，农垦部在友谊农场召开了密山、合江两个垦区国营农场种子工作现场会议。会上制订了两个垦区发展良种的规划：1959年种子田面积将达七十万亩，计划繁殖大豆、小麦、玉米、水稻等各种作物良种三亿四千万斤，其中繁殖新品种及后备品种八千万斤，约占23％，除两个垦区自用以外，还可以外调四千万斤良种，支援新建场及附近人民公社。
    为了保证良种发展规划的彻底实现，农垦部结合两垦区的实际情况，修订了建立良种繁育基地网的具体规划。根据农场分布情况和土壤气候特点，确定在两个垦区建立十个地区的良种繁育试验场；各总场共建立二十五个良种繁育试验站；各分场共建立一百二十一个良种队；各生产队设种子组，建立种子田。以地区良种场为中心，构成系统的良种繁育基地网。良种场的任务主要是生产原种，负责引种、品种试验、栽培试验和培育新品种；良种站负责扩大繁殖原种，进行品种区域适应性鉴定；良种队负责繁殖各生产队种子田的种子，或直接供应大田需要的种子。这样建立了系统的良种繁育制度，就为实现定期更换新品种，不断提高种子工作打下了基础。
    两垦区各农场的良种繁殖田一般采用三级制，即良种站由良种场取来原种繁殖原种一代，良种队繁殖原种二代，生产队种子田繁殖大田的种子。至于今年准备大量培育和繁殖的优良品种，大豆有满仓金、东丰一号、荆山朴、黑龙江四十一号；小麦有合作五号、二号、甘肃九十六号；水稻有合作一号、三号、红芒、小白毛；玉米有红洋子、白头霜。
    现在，为使规划落底落实，两垦区各国营农场都已积极行动起来。如密山农垦局八五○农场就抽出一万五千多亩作为良种基地，其中三千七百亩繁殖原种。该场为使良种工作能有较快的发展，已经调拨了一百三十吨磷矿肥和大批中耕、播种机具。并建立了专用种子仓库和洋灰晒场，添置了许多仪器，成立了研究室。
