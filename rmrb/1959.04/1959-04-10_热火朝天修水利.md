　　Building Irrigation Works in Full Swing
　　By our reporter Li Cheng

　　The sunset cast a reddish glow over the waters of the "Salvation" Reservoir. Standing on the dam, we looked into the distance and saw many farmers using picks and shovels to build new reservoirs.

　　The chairman of the "May First" Agricultural Cooperative, Grozdev, who led us to see the "Salvation" Reservoir, said meaningfully: "Now, the farmers are actively responding to the Party's call, building reservoirs, digging canals, and expanding the area of irrigated land. When there aren't enough machines, they use picks and shovels. However, seven or eight years ago, when we were building the 'Salvation' Reservoir, the scene was completely different from today…" Then he recounted the process of building the "Salvation" Reservoir.
　　　　A Good Example

　　Nikolayevo Village is a large village with a total of 1,350 households. In 1952, led by Party members, 120 households joined the "May First" Agricultural Cooperative. At that time, due to the low yield of cultivated land, each labor-day only earned one and a half levs (Bulgarian currency), and many farmers left the village to find work elsewhere.

　　The members of the agricultural cooperative were determined to change this situation. They planned to build an earthen dam reservoir on the Kaladere River, a small river near the village, to turn some dry land into irrigated land and increase production.

　　At this time, the farmers who had not yet joined the cooperative discussed: The Kaladere River often floods, and the earthen dam cannot withstand the floodwaters, so it will be useless even if it is built.

　　These discussions were confirmed. In October 1952, the reservoir's dam had just been built to a height of six or seven meters, and the work of strengthening the dam body had not yet been carried out when the river rose and the floodwaters surged. The dam was washed away. As a result, the farmers who did not believe in success discussed it even more. They advised the cooperative members: Earthen dams won't work, there's no need to waste your efforts!

　　However, the members of the "May First" Agricultural Cooperative were not intimidated by the difficulties. They learned from the failures. They wanted to build the dam before the flood season and do a good job of strengthening the dam body, so they would definitely be able to withstand the impact of the floodwaters. After more than seven months of hard work in the winter of 1952 and the spring of 1953, overcoming various difficulties, they finally built this reservoir.

　　In the year the reservoir was completed, the agricultural cooperative planted 350 decares (each decare is equal to one and a half mu) of rice, yielding 550 kilograms per decare. In addition, they also raised 12 tons of fish in the reservoir. Rice appeared for the first time on the cultivated land of Nikolayevo Village. At the end of that year, the daily wage for each labor-day in the agricultural cooperative was doubled and a half compared to previous years, reaching 3.70 levs. In order to commemorate the significance and role of this reservoir in increasing the income of cooperative members, the members called it the "Salvation" Reservoir.

　　Since then, the members of the "May First" Agricultural Cooperative have become even more enthusiastic about building small reservoirs. During the slack farming seasons in winter and spring, they concentrated their efforts on building reservoirs, digging canals, and expanding the area of irrigated land. By the end of last year, they had built seven more earthen dam reservoirs, and the area of irrigated land had expanded to 12,000 decares, accounting for more than 20% of all cultivated land in the agricultural cooperative. Now, the members of the "May First" Agricultural Cooperative are investing new strength in the intense labor of building reservoirs and digging canals. They are determined to expand the irrigated area of the agricultural cooperative to 18,000 decares by the end of May this year, and to 20,000 decares by the end of 1960, accounting for more than 30% of the total cultivated land area of the agricultural cooperative.

　　Due to the continuous expansion of irrigated land and the cultivation of grape and vegetable crops, as well as the government's cancellation and reduction of state procurement and procurement volumes for some agricultural and livestock products in 1956, by 1957, the daily wage for each labor-day in the agricultural cooperative had increased to 19.4 levs. Last year, although it was a relatively dry year, the daily wage for each labor-day in the agricultural cooperative was still above 17 levs.

　　Witnessing the continuous increase in the yield of cultivated land and the income of the cooperative members in the agricultural cooperative, the more than 1,000 households of farmers who had not joined the cooperative went from suspicion and hesitation to resolutely demanding to join the cooperative. At the end of 1953, that is, at the end of the year when the "Salvation" Reservoir was completed, 1,000 households of farmers joined the cooperative. By 1956, all the farmers in the village had become members of the agricultural cooperative.

　　The chairman of the "May First" Agricultural Cooperative, Grozdev, told us: The average income of each cooperative member household in the agricultural cooperative in 1958 was 6,200 levs, which will increase to 7,500 levs this year, and is expected to increase to 12,000 levs by the end of 1960. Now, almost every household has a radio and a bicycle. Before liberation, there were about 850 households of poor farmers with no or little land in this village. Compared with the current situation, we can see how profound the changes in the lives of Bulgarian farmers have been.

　　After the launch of the nationwide movement of "completing the Five-Year Plan in three or four years," agricultural cooperative members across Bulgaria launched a vigorous irrigation construction movement. The example of the "May First" Agricultural Cooperative building earthen dam reservoirs has become a good example for agricultural cooperatives in the Plovdiv Administrative and Economic Region to learn from. They all said: What the "May First" Agricultural Cooperative can do, we can also do.
　　　　Working Together to Build Reservoirs

　　In order to rapidly expand the area of irrigated land, in addition to building small reservoirs and pumping stations and other water conservancy projects, agricultural cooperatives must also build some larger-scale reservoirs, canals, and other projects. However, if a single agricultural cooperative were to build a larger-scale water conservancy project alone, it would feel that the funds and manpower were insufficient. Therefore, some agricultural cooperatives voluntarily proposed to cooperate with other agricultural cooperatives to build reservoirs or dig canals, breaking the boundaries of the cooperatives.

　　Recently, we visited a reservoir construction site in the Plovdiv Administrative and Economic Region that was being built jointly by eight agricultural cooperatives. The reservoir is located on the Byasochinik River, about 30 kilometers northwest of Plovdiv. After the spring rain, the construction site was still very muddy. However, bulldozers, excavators, and automatic unloading trucks were already running on the construction site. The site director, Dimitar Groshev, told us: "Long ago, the national design department had already made a plan to build this reservoir. However, construction would not begin until 1972. Now, the state has accepted the proposal of the eight agricultural cooperatives and handed over the construction of this reservoir to them. It is expected that the first phase of the project will be completed by the end of this year, which can irrigate more than 200,000 decares."

　　This project is led by a construction committee composed of one representative from each agricultural cooperative participating in the construction. All the expenses required for the project are provided by the state in the form of loans, and the labor force and transportation tools are shared by the eight agricultural cooperatives. The bulldozers, excavators, and other equipment on the construction site are allocated to them by the state.
　　　　Completing the Five-Year Plan in Two Years

　　The irrigation season is approaching. In addition to carrying out spring plowing intensively, the members of agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Bulgaria have also launched a water conservancy shock month campaign.

　　Since the Tenth Plenary Session of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee last October, many small-scale water conservancy projects have been built by agricultural cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics, from November last year to March 15 this year, agricultural cooperatives across Bulgaria have completed 672 water conservancy projects such as reservoirs and pumping stations, which can irrigate more than 363,000 decares; there are more than 1,400 projects currently under construction, which can irrigate more than 1.42 million decares. It is expected that all these projects will be completed and start irrigating fields before June 1 this year.

　　Being able to turn so much dry land into irrigated land in just over half a year is a miracle that has never been seen before in the history of farmland water conservancy in Bulgaria. Before liberation, the total area of irrigated land in Bulgaria was only 357,000 decares. After liberation, the area of irrigated land increased to 4.2 million decares by last October. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the total area of irrigated land will be more than 6 million decares, which will reach and exceed the target set by the Third Five-Year Plan—6 million decares. In other words, the task of expanding the irrigated area stipulated in the Third Five-Year Plan will be completed in two years.

　　How was the miracle created? Bulgarian comrades said that this is due to the Bulgarian Communist Party's timely issuance of the call to "complete the Five-Year Plan in three or four years," and fully relying on and giving play to the socialist enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the broad masses of cooperative members of agricultural cooperatives, so that the strength of the state and the strength of agricultural cooperatives are closely coordinated and rationally utilized.

    热火朝天修水利
    本报记者　李成
    夕阳照得“救生”水库的水泛起一片红光。我们站在拦河坝上，举目望去，看见远处许多农民正在用十字镐和铁锹修筑新水库。
    带领我们来看“救生”水库的“五一”农业合作社主席格罗兹德夫意味深长地说：“现在，农民都积极响应党的号召，修水库，挖水渠，扩大水浇地面积，机器不够用，就用十字镐和铁锹。但是，在七、八年前，当我们修“救生”水库的时候，情景却与今天完全两样……”。接着他就讲述修建“救生”水库的经过。
          好榜样
    尼科拉耶沃村是个大村庄，共有一千三百五十户农民。1952年，党员带头，有一百二十户加入了“五一”农业合作社。当时，由于耕地产量低，每个劳动日报酬只有一个半列弗（保币），许多农民离开了村子，到别处去找工作。
    农业合作社的社员们决心要改变这种状况。他们打算在村子附近的一条小河——卡拉德莱河上修一座土坝水库，把一些旱地变成水浇地，提高产量。
    这时，还没有入社的农民纷纷议论说：卡拉德莱河常涨水，土坝撑不住大水，修成了也不顶用。
    这些议论应验了。1952年的10月，水库的拦河坝刚刚修起了六、七公尺高，还没有进行加固坝身的工作，河水涨了，洪水汹涌而来。水坝被冲垮了。于是，不相信会成功的农民们就更加议论纷纷了。他们劝告社员们说：土坝不行，不必再白费力气了！
    但是，“五一”农业合作社的社员们并没有被困难吓倒。他们吸取失败的教训。他们要在涨水季前修成拦河坝，作好坝身加固的工作，这样就一定能挡住大水的冲击。经过1952年冬和1953年春七个多月的奋战，克服了种种困难，终于修起了这个水库。
    水库修成的那一年，农业社种了三百五十狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一亩半）稻子，每狄卡尔收了五百五十公斤。另外，还在水库里养了十二吨鱼。稻子第一次出现在尼科拉耶沃村的耕地上。这年年底，农业社的每个劳动日报酬比往年增加了一倍半，达到三点七零列弗。为了纪念这个水库在增加社员收入方面的意义和作用，社员们都管它叫做“救生”水库。
    从此以后，“五一”农业合作社社员们修筑小水库的劲头更大了，每逢冬春农闲季节，就集中力量修水库，挖水渠，扩大水浇地面积。到去年底止，他们又修成了七个土坝小水库，水浇地面积已扩大为一万二千狄卡尔，占农业合作社全部耕地的20％以上。现在，“五一”农业合作社的社员们正在以新的力量投入兴修水库和开凿水渠的紧张劳动，他们决心要在今年5月底以前把农业合作社的水浇地面积扩大到一万八千狄卡尔，到1960年底将扩大到两万狄卡尔，占农业社全部耕地面积的30％以上。
    由于水浇地面积不断扩大，培植了葡萄和蔬菜作物，以及1956年政府取消和减少国家对一些农畜产品的征购和征购量，到1957年，农业合作社的每个劳动日报酬已增加到十九点四列弗。去年，虽然是比较干旱的一年，农业合作社的每个劳动日报酬还在十七列弗以上。
    目睹农业合作社耕地产量和社员收入不断增加，没有入社的一千多户农民对农业合作社的优越性由怀疑、动摇到坚决要求入社。1953年底，就是“救生”水库修成的那一年年底，有一千户农民入社。到1956年，全村农民就都成了农业合作社的社员了。
      “五一”农业合作社主席格罗兹德夫告诉我们：1958年农业合作社每户社员的平均收入为六千二百列弗，今年将增加到七千五百列弗，预计1960年底将增加到一万二千列弗。现在，几乎家家都有收音机和自行车。解放前，这个村子里大约有八百五十户农民是无地和少地的贫苦农民。和现在的情况比较，可以看见保加利亚农民的生活发生了怎样深刻的变化。
      “三、四年完成五年计划”的全民运动展开后，保加利亚全国农业合作社社员们展开了轰轰烈烈的兴修水利运动。“五一”农业合作社修建土坝水库的事例，成了普罗夫迪夫行政经济区的农业合作社学习的好榜样，他们都说：“五一”农业合作社能做到的，我们也能做到。
        合力修水库
    为了迅速扩大水浇地面积，除了兴修小型水库和抽水机站等水利工程外，农业合作社还要修建一些比较大型的水库、水渠等工程。但是，如果由一个农业合作社单独修建较大型的水利工程，就感到资金和力量不足。于是，有些农业合作社就自动提出和其他农业合作社合作修水库或开水渠的倡议，打破了社的界限。
    最近，我们到普罗夫迪夫行政经济区访问了一个由八个农业合作社合作修建的水库工地。水库位于普罗夫迪夫市西北约三十公里的比亚索奇尼克河上。春雨过后，工地上还很泥泞。但是，推土机，铲土机，自动卸土卡车却已奔驰在工地上。工地主任季米特尔·格罗谢夫告诉我们：“很久以前，国家的设计部门已经作出兴修这个水库的规划。但是，要到1972年才能动工兴建。现在，国家接受了八个农业合作社的倡议，交给他们来修建这个水库。预计到今年年底就能完成工程的第一阶段，可浇地二十万狄卡尔以上。”
    这项工程由每个参加修建的农业合作社各派一个代表组成的建设委员会领导。工程所需的全部费用由国家以贷款的方式贷给，劳动力和运输工具由八个农业合作社分担。工地上的推土机、铲土机等是国家拨给他们使用的。
      两年完成五年计划
    浇水季节快到了。保加利亚各地农业合作社的社员除了紧张地进行春耕外，还展开了水利突击月运动。
    去年保共中央十月全会以后，农业合作社兴修的小型水利工程很多。据不完全的统计，从去年11月到今年3月15日，保加利亚全国农业合作社已经修成的水库、抽水机站等水利工程有六百七十二个，可浇地三十六万三千多狄卡尔；现在正在修建的工程有一千四百多个，可浇地一百四十二万多狄卡尔。预计到今年6月1日前，这些工程就将全部建成，开始灌田。
    在半年多一点的时间内，能够把这样多的旱地变成水浇地，这是保加利亚农田水利史上从未有过的奇迹。解放前，保加利亚的水浇地面积总共只有三十五万七千狄卡尔。解放后，到去年10月为止，水浇地面积增加到四百二十万狄卡尔。预计到今年底，水浇地的总面积将有六百万狄卡尔以上，将达到和超过第三个五年计划规定的指标——六百万狄卡尔。换句话说，即第三个五年计划规定扩大灌溉面积的任务，将在两年内完成。
    奇迹是怎样造成的呢？保加利亚的同志说，这是由于保共及时发出了“三、四年完成五年计划”的号召，并充分依靠和发挥农业合作社广大社员群众建设社会主义的积极性、主动性和创造性，使国家力量和农业合作社力量密切配合和合理利用的结果。（附图片）
