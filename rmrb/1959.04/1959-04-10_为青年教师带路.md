    Leading the Way for Young Teachers
    Zhang Jing
    It is a glorious task for veteran teachers to impart their rich experience to young teachers, helping them to take to the podium as soon as possible.
    Here, the relationship between veteran and new teachers is just like that of seasoned veterans and new recruits, or skilled master craftsmen and apprentices. The old teach, the new learn, and both improve together. As a veteran teacher, one not only has the responsibility of teaching students but also the obligation to mentor apprentices, not only being a teacher of people but also a teacher of teachers. Both roles are indispensable.
    It is natural for veteran teachers to lead the way for young teachers, and for young teachers to learn from veteran teachers. How many experienced teachers have not benefited from the teaching and nurturing of veteran teachers? The problem is that this phenomenon of mutual teaching and learning has often been in a somewhat spontaneous state in the past. Therefore, the teaching level of young teachers is often very uneven, and the speed of improvement is relatively slow. Currently, the cause of education is developing rapidly. In the context of a severe shortage of teachers, can we shorten this training process? Can we consciously use the method of "old leading the new" to cultivate young teachers in a faster, better, and more economical way? This issue is related to the development, consolidation, and improvement of our educational cause and deserves everyone's attention.
    The approach of the Jiangsu Education Institute's Party Committee provides us with a very good experience. They give full play to the potential of veteran teachers and fully utilize their teaching experience, cultivating young teachers in a planned, organized way with the old leading the new. On the one hand, they strengthen the ideological education of both new and old teachers, making them aware of the responsibilities they shoulder; on the other hand, they adopt many specific measures, such as organizing lesson preparation groups, attending classes, and signing apprenticeship contracts. One veteran teacher can guide several new teachers at the same time. Through such organized activities, the expertise and experience of each veteran teacher are disseminated and inherited, and each young teacher receives opportunities for training and development. Many young teaching assistants who just graduated from schools last year have already started teaching this year and have received unanimous praise from students, which fully demonstrates the important role played by veteran teachers in cultivating young teachers.
    Cultivating young teachers is also an opportunity for veteran teachers to improve their own teaching level. The teaching experience of many veteran teachers has been gradually accumulated through countless successes and failures. They are very proficient in using it themselves, but to truly enable young teachers to master these experiences, it is necessary to first systematically summarize and organize them, and streamline the scattered experiences, which is itself a process of improvement. At the same time, veteran teachers can also learn from the successful experiences or lessons of failures in observing the teaching of new teachers, so as to further improve the quality of teaching.

    为青年教师带路
    张竞
    老教师把自己的丰富经验教给青年教师，帮助他们早日走上讲台，这是老教师的一个光荣任务。
    在这里，老教师和新教师的关系，正如身经百战的老战士与刚刚入伍的新兵，像技术熟练的老师傅与初学手艺的学徒一样，老的教，新的学，共同提高。作为一个老教师来说，不仅有教学生的责任，还有带徒弟的义务，不仅为人之师，还要为师之师。双重任务，都义不容辞。
    老教师为青年教师带路，青年教师向老教师学习，本来是很自然的现象，多少有经验的教师，谁没有受过老教师的教益和培养？问题是这种互教互学的现象，过去多少带有一些自发的状态，因此青年教师的教学水平往往很不平衡，提高的速度也比较缓慢。目前，教育事业一日千里地发展，在师资十分缺乏的情况下，能不能使这个培养的过程缩短一些呢？能不能自觉地来运用以老带新的方法，多快好省地培养青年教师呢？这个问题关系到我们教育事业的发展巩固和提高，值得引起大家的重视。
    江苏教育学院党委的做法，给我们提供了一条很好的经验。他们充分发挥老教师的潜力，充分运用了老教师的教学经验，有领导有计划有组织地以老带新培养青年教师，一方面加强新、老教师的思想教育，使他们认清自己所肩负的责任；一方面采取了许多具体的措施，如组织备课小组，跟班听课，订师徒合同等，一个老教师可以同时带好几个新教师，经过这样有组织的活动，使每一个老教师的专长和经验都得到了传播和继承，也使每一个青年教师都得到了培养和锻炼的机会。许多去年刚从学校里毕业出来的青年助教，今年都已经开课，而且得到学生的一致好评，这就充分说明了老教师在培养青年教师中所起的重要作用。
    培养青年教师，对于老教师本人同样也是一个提高教学水平的机会。许多老教师的教学经验，都是在无数次的成功和失败中逐渐积累起来的，自己运用起来很纯熟，但是要使这些经验真正为青年教师所掌握，就需要先经过一番系统的归纳和整理，把零星的经验条理化，这本身就是一个提高的过程。同时，老教师还可以在观察新教师的教学中，吸取成功的经验或失败的教训，来进一步提高教学质量。
