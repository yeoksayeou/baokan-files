Comrades Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Report on the Work of the Government. I also fully agree with the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

This year, China's steel production plan is 18 million tons, which is a huge leap forward target. Completing this leap forward target will significantly change the face of China's iron and steel industry. First, the many small iron and steel plants established last year in the vast majority of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country will form relatively complete iron and steel enterprises. Second, the number of large iron and steel enterprises will increase, and new iron and steel bases will emerge in some areas of China where there was no iron and steel industry in the past.

How can we accomplish this huge leap forward task? In addition to accelerating the capital construction of iron and steel enterprises, it is particularly necessary to follow the mass line in industrial production and construction, as Chairman Mao has long instructed, and to launch mass movements to unleash the potential of existing enterprises.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, advanced units with high output and high quality have emerged in all aspects of the iron and steel industry, including mines, coking, refractories, ironmaking, steelmaking, rolling, and transportation. The conditions for their production, whether equipment, raw materials, or other conditions, are not superior to those of other enterprises. However, because they resolutely relied on the masses and overcame numerous difficulties, they created many new favorable conditions for themselves. Therefore, their production has leaped from a general level to an advanced level. These enterprises, which have reached an advanced level due to the resolute implementation of the Party's policy of vigorously developing mass movements in industry, have shown us the possibility of tapping huge potential. For example, the average utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized ironmaking blast furnaces in China last year (the amount of iron produced per cubic meter of blast furnace volume per day and night) was 1.487 tons, while the blast furnace utilization coefficient of advanced units such as Benxi Iron and Steel Company has remained at around 2.1 tons since September last year. This advanced unit produces more than 600 kilograms of pig iron per cubic meter of blast furnace per day and night. The utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces in general steel plants (the amount of steel produced per square meter of open-hearth furnace bottom area per day and night) is 7.81 tons, while the utilization coefficient of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant has remained at around 13 tons for the past year. In this way, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant produces more than 6 tons of steel per square meter of open-hearth furnace bottom area per day and night. Other examples include the electric furnace utilization coefficient of Dalian Steel Plant, the shortening of refractory brick firing time by Chongqing Refractory Materials Plant, the ore dressing efficiency of Benxi Iron Mine, the converter utilization coefficient of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and No. 6 Steel Plant, and the rolling efficiency of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, all of which greatly exceed the general production units.

Isn't such a large gap in the equipment utilization coefficient between advanced units and general units a clear indication of the huge potential of existing equipment? If every enterprise on the iron and steel front learns from and keeps pace with these advanced units, output will be greatly increased. Of course, the equipment conditions, raw material conditions, technical proficiency, management level, and so on of each enterprise are different, and it is unrealistic to require all equipment utilization coefficients to reach the most advanced level, but it is possible to gradually increase by 10%, 20%, or even 30% without increasing the main equipment.

Let us see how advanced units have improved the potential of their original equipment through mass movements. The No. 1 Ironmaking Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, which has maintained the national blast furnace utilization coefficient champion for twelve consecutive months, has two medium-sized blast furnaces that are old equipment with more than 40 years of history, which people once called "old-tooth blast furnaces." In the past, many people believed that "there is not much to gain from the blast furnaces" and "the potential cannot be tapped any further." Only a year ago, the utilization coefficient of these two blast furnaces was only 1.39 tons, which was behind the brother units in the country and not as good as Anshan and Taiyuan.

However, they were not willing to lag behind and were determined to remove the backward label. The Party committee conducted several studies and finally affirmed: a few leading cadres cannot discuss the direction in the office, and to change the backward situation, we must follow the mass line. In the rectification and anti-rightist movement, they frankly explained the backward situation and difficulties to the masses without concealment, and launched a mass campaign together with the masses, calling on them to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced. As a result, the masses posted more than 110,000 big-character posters, believing that "what other factories can do, we should also be able to do," and were determined to catch up with Anshan and surpass Taiyuan. At this time, the Party committee resolutely relied on the masses and boldly adopted the smelting method of "simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio" (a new smelting method), and Party, government, trade union leading cadres and some technical cadres went to the No. 1 Youth Blast Furnace to "plant experimental fields." After 20 days of experiments, great results were achieved. The smelting intensity increased, and the consumption of coke was also reduced at the same time. As a result, in April last year, they won the national blast furnace collective championship, and the utilization coefficient reached 2.077 tons in September, and has remained above 2.1 tons ever since. In this way, the old blast furnace was rejuvenated and has been marching at the forefront of the national blast furnaces.

The reason why Benxi No. 1 Ironmaking Plant can go from backward to advanced and maintain the red flag for a long time is not because their equipment conditions are good, or because they have added any new major equipment. The most fundamental reason is that they despise difficulties and strive for the upper reaches; it is that they believe in the masses and rely on the masses. Facts have proved that when difficulties are handed over to the masses, they are often quickly resolved.

The national open-hearth steelmaking red flag Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, the electric furnace steelmaking red flag Dalian Steel Plant, the converter steelmaking red flag Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, and several rolling workshops of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, etc., are also the same as Benxi No. 1 Ironmaking Plant. Some have simple equipment, and some have poor raw material conditions, but they do a good job of people's work. The leadership does not sit and wait for the improvement of conditions, but tells the masses about the situation, assigns tasks, and shares difficulties. The leaders themselves also go deep into the furnace or workshop to work, and solve problems in a timely manner. As a result, everyone works together with one heart, giving full play to the subjective initiative, and production is changing with each passing day, becoming the most advanced unit.

Vigorously launching mass movements is the key to tapping the potential of existing equipment. This is true not only for enterprises that produce using foreign methods (modern production methods), but also for enterprises that produce using indigenous methods (simple production methods). Many small blast furnaces that use indigenous methods have mastered the technology quickly because the mass movement is well done. When the utilization coefficient of general small blast furnaces is only 0.5 tons or 0.6 tons, they have reached more than 1 ton. The consumption of coke is also much lower than that of general small blast furnaces. Of course, indigenous production and foreign production go hand in hand, and foreign production is the dominant aspect. At the same time, indigenous production is bound to develop in the direction of combining indigenous and foreign methods, but indigenous production will exist for a long time, so it is also very important to launch mass movements to tap the potential of indigenous production equipment.

The experience of these advanced units tells us that resolutely implementing the policy of mass movement and tapping the production potential of existing enterprises is an important measure to ensure the completion of this year's iron and steel industry production targets. Now we are using these experiences to improve our leadership and launch a high-yield, high-quality competition movement on the iron and steel front nationwide. We believe that with the in-depth development of the movement, the equipment capacity of existing enterprises will be greatly improved, and the steel production task this year can be successfully completed.

Premier Zhou's report mentioned that the armed rebellion launched by the former local government of Tibet and the reactionary upper strata to betray the motherland and undermine unification has been shamefully defeated, and we are very happy. The rebellion launched by these reactionaries in collusion with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries is completely contrary to the wishes of the Tibetan people, and their failure from the very beginning was expected. The failure of these reactionaries is the victory of the Tibetan people and the victory of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. From now on, the Tibetan people, who have been oppressed and breathless by the backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system for a long time, have the opportunity to get rid of the shackles of the serf system. Tibet is a part of China's territory, which no one can deny. Any conspiracy to use the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionaries to achieve ulterior motives is just a waste of effort and is destined to fail. All the staff and workers of our metallurgical industry fully support the wise policies adopted by our government on the Tibet issue. We hail another great victory achieved by our national unity policy. We are willing to work with the Tibetan people to build Tibet into a real paradise on earth.

### 开展群众运动完成钢铁生产计划  冶金工业部王鹤寿部长的发言

    开展群众运动完成钢铁生产计划
    冶金工业部王鹤寿部长的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告。也完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    今年我国钢的生产计划是一千八百万吨，这是一个巨大的跃进指标，完成了这个跃进指标，我国钢铁工业的面貌将会有重大的改观。首先，在全国绝大多数的省、市、自治区中，去年建立起来的许多小型钢铁厂，将形成比较完整的钢铁企业；第二，大型钢铁企业的数目增加，在我国过去没有钢铁工业的一些地区，将出现新的钢铁基地。
    我们如何完成这个巨大的跃进任务呢？除了加速钢铁企业的基本建设外，还特别需要根据毛主席早已指示的，在工业生产建设中走群众路线，开展群众运动，以发挥现有企业潜力。
    去年大跃进以来，在钢铁工业的矿山、炼焦、耐火材料、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、运输……等各个方面，都出现了高产、优质的先进单位。它们进行生产的条件无论是设备、原料或其他条件，并不比其他企业更为优厚，不过由于他们坚决依靠了群众，克服了重重困难，给自己创造了许多新的有利条件。所以他们的生产，由一般的水平跃到了先进的水平。这些由于坚决执行党的在工业中大搞群众运动的方针，而达到先进水平的企业，给我们指出了挖掘巨大潜力的可能性。例如我国大中型的炼铁高炉，去年的平均利用系数（一立方公尺的高炉容积一昼夜的出铁量）是一点四八七吨，而先进单位如本溪钢铁公司的高炉利用系数，去年九月以来一直保持在二点一吨左右，这个先进的单位，每一立方公尺的高炉，一昼夜就多生产出六百多公斤生铁；一般钢铁厂的平炉利用系数（一平方公尺的平炉炉底面积一昼夜的出钢量）是七点八一吨，而上海第三钢厂的利用系数，一年以来一直保持在十三吨左右，这样，上海第三钢厂每一平方公尺的平炉炉底面积，一昼夜就多生产出六吨多钢。其他如大连钢厂的电炉利用系数，重庆耐火材料厂的缩短耐火砖烧成时间，本溪铁矿的选矿效率，上海第三钢厂和第六钢厂的转炉利用系数，鞍山钢铁公司的轧钢效率等等，都大大地超过了一般的生产单位。
    先进单位和一般单位的设备利用系数上，有这样大的距离，不是正说明现有设备存在着巨大潜力吗？如果钢铁战线上的每一个企业，都向这些先进单位学习和看齐，产量就会大大提高。当然，每一个企业的设备情况、原料条件、技术熟练程度、管理水平等等是不相同的，要求所有设备的利用系数，都达到最先进的水平是不现实的，但是在不增加主要设备的条件下，逐步提高百分之十、百分之二十以至于百分之三十，则是可能的。
    让我们看看先进单位是怎样从群众运动中，提高了原有设备的潜力吧。连续十二个月保持全国高炉利用系数冠军的本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂，两座中型高炉，都是有四十多年历史的陈旧设备，人们曾称之为“老掉了牙的高炉”。过去许多人认为“高炉油水不大了”，“潜力不能再挖了”。就在一年以前，这两个高炉的利用系数也只有一点三九吨，和全国兄弟单位比较，落在了后面，不如鞍山和太原。
    但是他们不甘于落后，决心摘掉落后帽子。党委曾作了几次研究，最后肯定：少数领导干部在办公室里是讨论不出方向的，要改变落后面貌，只有走群众路线。他们就在整风双反运动中，毫不掩饰地把落后情况和困难，向群众做了交代，并和群众一起大鸣大放，号召学先进、赶先进。结果群众贴出了十一万多张大字报，认为“别的厂能做到的事，我们也应该做到”，决心赶鞍山、超太原。这时党委坚决依靠群众，大胆采用了“提高冶炼强度与降低焦比双管齐下”（这是一种新的冶炼方法）的冶炼方法，党政工团领导干部和一部分技术干部，到一号青年高炉“种试验田”。经过二十天的试验，取得了很大的效果。冶炼强度提高了，焦炭的消耗也同时降低了。结果，在去年四月，得到了全国高炉的集体冠军，九月利用系数达到二点零七七吨，以后就一直维持在二点一吨以上。这样，老高炉就恢复了青春，一直大踏步地走在全国高炉的最前列。
    本溪第一炼铁厂能够从落后到先进，长期保持红旗，并不是他们的设备条件好，或者增加了什么新的主要设备。最根本的原因是他们藐视困难，力争上游；是他们相信群众，依靠群众。事实证明：困难一交给群众，就常常很快得到解决。
    全国平炉炼钢的红旗上海第三钢厂，电炉炼钢的红旗大连钢厂，转炉炼钢的红旗上海第六钢厂，以及鞍钢的几个轧钢车间等等，也和本溪第一炼铁厂一样，有的设备简陋，有的原料条件不好，但是他们把人的工作做得好，领导上不是坐待条件的改善，而是向群众讲形势，交任务，交困难，领导者自己也深入炉前或车间跟班劳动，发现问题及时解决。结果上下一心，充分发挥了主观能动性的作用，生产就日新月异，成为最先进的单位。
    大搞群众运动是发挥原有设备潜力的关键，不但对用洋法（现代化的生产方法）生产的企业是这样，对用土法（简易的生产方法）生产的企业也是这样。许多用土法生产的小高炉，由于群众运动搞得好，群众很快地掌握了技术，当一般小高炉利用系数只有零点五吨、零点六吨的时候，它们已到一吨以上。焦炭的消耗也比一般小高炉低得多。当然，土法生产和洋法生产同时并举，洋法生产是主导方面。同时土法生产，也必然向土洋结合的方向发展，但是土法生产是长期存在的，因此开展群众运动，发挥土法生产设备的潜力，也是很重要的。
    这些先进单位的经验告诉我们，坚决执行群众运动的方针，发挥原有企业的生产潜力，是保证完成今年钢铁工业生产指标的重要措施。现在我们正运用这些经验，改进我们的领导，并在全国范围内开展钢铁战线上的高产、优质竞赛运动。我们相信，随着运动的深入发展，现有企业的设备能力，会大大提高，今年钢的生产任务就能胜利完成。
    周总理的报告中讲到，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的背叛祖国、破坏统一的武装叛乱，已遭到可耻的失败，我们感到十分高兴。这些反动分子勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和国外反动派所发动的叛乱，是完全违背西藏人民的意愿的，他们一开始叛乱就遭到失败，是在意料之中。这些反动分子的失败，就是西藏人民的胜利，就是全国各族人民的胜利。从此，长期以来被落后的、黑暗的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度压榨得喘不过气的西藏人民，已经有可能摆脱农奴制度的枷锁。西藏是中国领土的一部分，这是任何人都无法否认的。任何想利用西藏反动分子叛乱来达到不可告人的目的的阴谋，不过是枉费心机，注定要失败的。我们冶金工业全体职工完全拥护我国政府在西藏问题上所采取的英明的政策，我们欢呼我国民族团结政策所获得的又一个伟大的胜利，我们愿与西藏人民一道，把西藏建设成为一个真正的人间乐园。
