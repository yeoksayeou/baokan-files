Xinhua News Agency, April 14th dispatch from New Delhi: Since the outbreak of the rebellion in Tibet, certain Indian newspapers have carried many reports distorting the truth and have taken the opportunity to publish many slanderous remarks interfering in China's internal affairs and poisoning Sino-Indian friendship.

These newspapers openly deny China's well-known sovereignty over Tibet. The "Hindustan Times," in an editorial on March 30th entitled "The Ravaging of Tibet," described Tibet as a "small country." It said, "Let us bow our heads in silence today. A small country on our border is receiving the final punishment for its resolute aspiration for independence. Tibet is dead." It said, "If we do not heed the warning even now, many other things will die along with Tibet. The shadow of China looms over all the lands around us. This is a dark shadow of influence on us." The newspaper clamored for a "re-evaluation" of the foundation of India's foreign policy towards China.

Another newspaper, the "Mail," said of Tibet's status, "According to the policy adopted by the British Indian government, India recognizes China's suzerainty, but not sovereignty, and also insists that Tibetans have the right to autonomy."

These newspapers attacked the People's Liberation Army's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion with vicious language. The "Organizer," a publication of the Indian People's League, maliciously stated in an editorial entitled "Plundering Tibet," "China has no legitimate right or qualification to invade, occupy, and turn Tibet into a colony and enslave it." It insisted that the presence of Chinese troops in its own territory of Tibet was a "direct threat to India's security." It openly incited Tibet to secede from China, saying, "Maintaining Tibet's independence and integrity is a matter of vital interest to Tibet's life and our own integrity and security." The "Leader" even insulted the Chinese government on April 1st for "adopting bandit-like behavior and practicing imperialism."

Some newspapers even openly clamored for interference in the Tibetan rebellion, a matter purely within China's internal affairs. The "Indian Express" demanded on March 27th that the Indian government "not adopt an ambiguous attitude" towards the situation in Tibet. This newspaper even demanded that the Indian government "protest" against the Chinese government's suppression of Tibetan rebels in the same way it protested against the British and French invasion of Egypt.

In a commentary published on April 1st, it also compared the Tibetan rebellion to the "Algerian independence cause," saying that India "cannot stand idly by." It accused Nehru of "adopting an ambiguous attitude" and "treating the aggressor China and the aggressed Tibet equally." The "Organizer" also said on April 1st that it hoped that the personnel of the Indian Consulate General in Lhasa would "fight to the death for the freedom of India's brotherly neighbor, Tibet."

### 印度一些报纸  利用西藏事件诽谤我国  竟发表干涉中国内政和毒害中印友谊言论

　　印度一些报纸
　　利用西藏事件诽谤我国
　　竟发表干涉中国内政和毒害中印友谊言论
    新华社14日讯　新德里消息：在西藏叛乱事件发生以后，印度某些报纸曾经刊载了许多歪曲真相的报道，并且借这个事件发表了许多诽谤性的、干涉中国内政和毒害中印友谊的言论。
    这些报纸竟公然否认人所共知的中国对西藏的主权。“印度斯坦时报”在3月30日题为“对西藏的蹂躏”的社论中把西藏说成是一个“小国”。它说，“让我们今天低头默哀，我们边境上的一个小国为了它的热望独立的坚决态度而受到最后的惩罚。西藏死亡了。”它说，“如果我们甚至现在还不注意警告的话，还会有许多别的东西会跟西藏一起死亡。在我们周围的一切土地上笼罩着中国的影子。这是对我们的影响的一个暗影”。这家报纸叫嚷“重新估计”印度对华外交政策的基础。
    另一家报纸“邮报”在谈到西藏的地位时说，“根据英属印度政府所采取的政策，印度承认中国享有宗主权，但不是享有主权，同时也坚持西藏人有自治的权利。”
    这些报纸用恶毒的字句攻击我人民解放军平息西藏叛乱。印度人民同盟的“组织家报”在一篇题为“掠夺西藏”的社论中恶意地说，“中国没有侵入、占领西藏并使它变成殖民地和遭受奴役的合法权利和资格。”它硬说中国军队驻在自己的领土西藏是“对印度安全直接的威胁”。它公然煽动要西藏从中国分裂出去，它说，“保持西藏的独立和完整对西藏的生活和我们自己的完整和安全具有切身的利害关系”。“领袖报”在4月1日还辱骂中国政府“采取强盗行径和实行帝国主义”。
    一些报纸更公然叫嚣要对西藏叛乱事件这一纯属中国内政的问题进行干涉。“印度快报”在3月27日要求印度政府对西藏局势“不要抱暧昧的态度”。这家报纸竟然要求印度政府像抗议英法侵略埃及一样来“抗议”中国政府镇压西藏叛匪的行动。
    它在4月1日发表评论时，还把西藏叛乱同“阿尔及利亚的独立事业”相提并论，说什么印度对此“不能袖手旁观”。它指责尼赫鲁
  “态度含糊”，“把侵略者中国和被侵略的西藏同等看待”。“组织家报”在4月1日还说，希望印度驻拉萨总领事馆的人员为印度的“兄弟般的邻邦西藏的自由而战死”。
