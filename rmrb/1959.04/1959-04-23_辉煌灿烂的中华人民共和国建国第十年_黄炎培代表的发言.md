Mr. Chairman, fellow Representatives, fellow Committee Members:

Under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great unity of all nationalities and strata of the country, the glorious and splendid New China, with the people constantly summoning up soaring enthusiasm and leaping forward step by step, has experienced the all-round Great Leap Forward of 1958 and is heading for an even greater Leap Forward in 1959, precisely the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. As long as people have eyes to see and ears to hear, who would not clearly recognize, from the stark contrast between the past and the present, between those countries and these countries, that today's New China has begun to embark on the road of eliminating exploitation, eliminating poverty, and building a prosperous and happy socialist society! It must be recognized that this is an undeniable and powerful proof of the irresistible East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. (Enthusiastic applause)

The First Session of the Second National People's Congress has opened under the personal chairmanship of Chairman Mao Zedong. The First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was also held simultaneously. I listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft National Economic Plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 State Final Accounts and the 1959 State Budget draft, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the Standing Committee at the CPPCC meeting. From the above reports, we clearly understand the great achievements of the first Five-Year Plan period and the first year of the second Five-Year Plan, 1958; the great tasks of the second year of the second Five-Year Plan, 1959; the wise and correct domestic and foreign policies and guidelines; and the consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front. I fully support them and feel indescribable excitement! Emotion! Rejoicing! (Applause)
Indian expansionists, wake up!

Disseminating Absurd Documents Violates the Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; the Chinese People Can Drive Imperialism Out of China and Will Never Allow Foreign Forces to Interfere in Our Internal Affairs

Having lived for more than eighty years, I have experienced the dark rule of the Qing Dynasty emperors, the Northern Warlords, and the Kuomintang, and witnessed firsthand how viciously imperialism invaded and divided China. Since liberation, our country has become stronger day by day, especially last year when we achieved a great leap forward. I was in a state of infinite excitement, emotion, and rejoicing when I suddenly saw a small group of reactionary elements in Tibet, after their rebellion in Tibet failed, fleeing to India to collude with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, attempting to play the trick of so-called Tibetan "independence" and trying to separate Tibet from our motherland, which made me feel extremely indignant. (Applause)

Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, which is recognized by the whole world, including India. The rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary elements and the suppression of this rebellion are China's internal affairs, and no foreign country can interfere. (Applause) The Central People's Government's policy on this event has been made very clear by Premier Zhou in his report. These measures are very correct, and we fully support them. The internal affairs of a country can only be handled by that country itself. This is the basic principle of relations between countries. However, what I personally find very surprising is that on the 18th of this month, in Tezpur, India, Indian diplomatic officials distributed a so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama," the content of which is utterly absurd. Did the Indian government not know about such a political document openly attacking the Chinese government in advance? (Laughter) For a long time, Tibetan reactionary elements have used Kalimpong in India as a center for their conspiracies abroad. After the Tibetan rebellion occurred, the Tibetan rebels fled to India, received gracious hospitality and a warm welcome, and a wave of calls for so-called Tibetan "independence" was stirred up in India. Now they can even distribute such absurd documents through Indian officials. From this series of facts, can one find even a trace of compliance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence? Hasn't Prime Minister Nehru said that he would not allow things to happen that would embarrass India's relationship with China? Hasn't he said that he would not allow political activities against another country to be carried out in India? Can the aforementioned political activities against China be tolerated by a country friendly to China? (Enthusiastic applause) I would like to remind Indian people to pay attention: if the situation were reversed, if one or another of India's neighboring countries used their country's territory as a center for foreign activities against India, to split off this state or that province of India, I ask, would the Indian people and government tolerate it? (Applause) On such a serious issue concerning the "Five Principles" and the friendly relations between China and India, if they continue to move in the wrong direction, it will only harm the interests of India, which is known for advocating peaceful coexistence, and make the colonialists happy. Now that the Tibetan rebellion has been quelled, the Tibetan people are increasingly firmly united with all nationalities, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to strive to build a democratic and socialist New Tibet. Ten years ago, the Chinese people had the strength to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule and drive imperialism out of China. After ten years of great construction, can the Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, still not eliminate the remaining traitorous bandits? (Applause) Can they still allow foreign forces to interfere in China's internal affairs? (Applause) I advise the expansionist gentlemen of India to wake up. The era in which imperialism and foreign reactionary forces split China or manipulate China's internal affairs is gone forever. The dark serf system is bound to be eliminated, and a democratic and socialist New Tibet will surely appear in the big family of Chinese nationalities. (Enthusiastic applause)

Continuing the Great Leap Forward This Year is Absolutely Possible:

Experimentation from Point to Area Will Yield Even Greater Harvests
More Rational and Adequate Distribution and Scheduling of Materials
Adjustments Have Been Made to Human Resources, and Experience is Even Richer

Now, I would like to present some personal views on the Great Leap Forward:

If you ask: Is it possible to have an even greater leap forward in 1959 after the great leap forward of 1958? I can say with certainty: Absolutely possible. There are at least three points that are sufficient to base this on: First: Last year's Great Leap Forward was still mostly focused on key experiments, and astonishing harvests were obtained from the experiments. This year, 1959, the points have been expanded into areas, so of course the harvests will be even greater. Second: Last year's Great Leap Forward was limited by various conditions in many aspects, such as industry, some limited by raw materials, limited by machinery and equipment, and so on. Since last year, sufficient supplies have been planned as much as possible, as Premier Zhou has already said in his report. The situation is even different this year, 1959. Various supplements, allocations, and scheduling are more rational and adequate. Third: Human resources were still a problem in some places last year. After the development of the People's Communes, a large amount of accumulation and adjustment has been made. The quantity has increased, and rich experience has been accumulated. From trial learning to proficiency, the quality has also improved. Therefore, this year's situation will be even different from last year. - Some people doubt whether a greater leap forward is possible because they do not understand the actual situation. - This plan, based on realistic estimates, proposes four major targets for 1959: 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 105 billion jin of grain, and 100 million dan of cotton. Not only is it possible to complete the production tasks, but also to over fulfill them. This is only speaking in terms of key points; the Great Leap Forward is all-round. Under the situation of "the whole country as a single chess game," everything is developing in a planned, overall, and closely coordinated manner. It is being carried out comprehensively by the broad masses of the people combined with cadres personally. Under the call of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Are these not enough to guarantee a greater leap forward!

Three Areas of Effort in the Future:

Continuously Develop Production and Fully Utilize Resources
Make Great Efforts in the Technical Revolution and Continue to Conquer Nature
Love Each Other and Realize the Communist Ideal

In the future, I think it should be, and is now, striving in the following three aspects:

The first aspect is to continuously develop production in a planned way. Under the call to tap rich potential as much as possible, the plains area certainly has a particularly large room for development. As far as agriculture is concerned, even when the demand is sufficient, we should still adopt the policy of planting less and harvesting more, and continue to strive for high yields. In addition, there are the mountainous and border areas with endless rich resources. These places only suffer from a lack of labor. Taking Jiangxi province as an example, a responsible comrade told me: "The mountainous area of Jiangxi has an average of up to 40 mu of arable land per person." This shows that if given a considerable amount of labor, there is still such a large area of arable land that can be produced. Expanding the scope to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, the resources are even more infinite. I have personally seen the tussah silkworm forests by the Yalu River and the kapok forests in the upper reaches of the Jinsha River. At that time, as someone who grew up in the cotton and silk producing areas of Jiangsu, I was greatly surprised to discover that these places in the motherland still have such beautiful and rich resources. If these are studied, well utilized, or even expanded and transplanted, how beneficial it would be to increase the supply to meet the needs of the people's lives! But these are just a few examples.

The second aspect is that under the call to make great efforts in the technical revolution, dozens or hundreds of types, tens of millions of types, of technical reforms and rationalization proposals are constantly emerging in one unit and one region. In the future, it will continue to develop greatly. Just from what I have personally come into contact with, let me give a few examples: In March 1958, when I visited the Shanghai Shenxin No. 6 Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, it was still the early stage of the Great Leap Forward. Qin Defang, the private factory director and chief engineer, encouraged by the leadership, personally went to the factory to work, and as a result of joint efforts with the workers, the spindles jumped from only 210 revolutions per minute to 310 revolutions per minute, while in the UK it was only 200 revolutions. Recently, we have accelerated to 370 revolutions. I also know that some factories have reached 400 revolutions, and some have exceeded 400 revolutions. This is just one example. Miraculous inventions, such as "electrostatic spinning," where cotton does not need to go through cleaning and other procedures but automatically spins into yarn; Hangzhou, Shanghai and other places are experimenting with it; such as "shuttleless weaving," where yarn automatically weaves into cloth; several factories in Shanghai and other places are experimenting with it; such as "hydraulic coal mining," using water pumps to increase the pressure of water to impact the coal seam for mining, which greatly saves manpower and material resources. Many mines are now using this new method, and the results of four mines are particularly high. Their output at the end of 1958 increased by 26 times compared to 1957. These were all told to me by responsible comrades. Speaking of hydraulic coal mining, I am greatly gratified. I went down into coal mines before liberation. In the coal mine, in less than ten minutes, the air was suffocating and I couldn't bear it. Thinking of the many, many workers working in the coal mine for long days, this high degree of misery, no wonder the mortality rate of coal mine workers was particularly high at that time. (Mostly silicosis, coal worker's pneumoconiosis.) The escape rate was also particularly high. Since liberation, the working conditions of miners have been greatly improved, and hydraulic coal mining has basically solved this problem. In addition, "biogas power generation," I saw in Hangzhou next to the West Lake, taking biogas from the sludge and sending it to the agricultural exhibition hall for experiments to show the masses, indicating that within one hour, 4.8 cubic meters of biogas can drive a 45-horsepower machine. Its function is endless, and its source can be taken anywhere. Recently, I also saw in the newspaper that counties near Shanghai were drilling wells everywhere to use "natural gas." In the future, "solar energy" and "atomic energy" will be expanded and utilized. The rich resources of nature are simply endless. We must recognize that the technical revolution, from today's perspective, although many discoveries have been made, is only the first step of a long march. Work hard! Work hard! Conquer nature, utilize nature, and transform nature. Mankind will become the conscious and true master of nature. (Applause)

The third aspect is that under the leadership of the Party, we have embarked on the socialist road of distributing according to work, and are looking forward to advancing on the communist road of distributing according to need, thus gradually changing the relationship between people. The Chinese have long had an ideal: "People should not only be kind to their own relatives, nor only love their own children." "Hating that goods are abandoned on the ground, one does not necessarily store them for oneself; regretting that strength is not exerted from one's own body, one does not necessarily do it for oneself." (Isn't this voluntary labor!) "Conspiracies are blocked and do not arise, (there is no hoarding and speculation.) Thieves and rebels do not act." To achieve these, the fundamental lies in achieving "the young are cared for, the strong are employed, the old are supported, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled are all cared for." We must first solve these living problems for them. However, although it sounds logical, which era, which society, has ever realized it! Now we understand. These can absolutely not be hoped for in feudal society or capitalist society. China is liberated. In the ten years since, the face has been changing step by step: In 1955, I first saw a large group of men and women doing voluntary labor in Hangzhou. On August 20, 1958, the People's Daily wrote a surprising title: "Eight No's." What are the eight no's? No one is managing (1) selling food, (2) paying wages, (3) issuing and receiving tools, (4) issuing and receiving books, (5) issuing and receiving recreational room supplies, (6) collecting membership fees, (7) selling movie tickets, (8) selling bath tickets. It was discovered in the Jianhua Machinery Factory in Qiqihar City. In 1958, I saw from the People's Communes in various places that Commune A mobilized a lot of labor to support Commune B. These kinds of things can now be seen everywhere.

From then on, although the boundaries of mine, yours, and his cannot be eliminated all at once, these lines are gradually fading. In the future, the relationship between people will tend towards loving each other, helping each other, conceding to each other, and advising each other, instead of playing various tricks in the past, deceiving me and cheating you, or even robbing and plundering you. Of course, these are just good beginnings.

What do these three aspects rely on to connect and develop? It is the People's Commune.

Only the People's Commune can absorb and adjust human and material resources to develop production as much as possible in a planned way; only the People's Commune can fully utilize the intelligence of each person and the collective wisdom of the masses, and endlessly and continuously engage in the technical revolution; only the People's Commune can solve the people's employment problems and material needs problems, so that people are accustomed to organized life and collective life, and naturally gradually change the spiritual outlook between people. These facts are all in front of us, and this is cultivating the communist style.

Hopes for Industrial and Commercial People:

Recognize Your Position, Make Up Your Mind to Continue Transforming
Contribute Skills and Ideas, Increase Production and Save Money, and Make Achievements

The Great Leap Forward is a characteristic of the current situation in our country and also a reflection of the will of the people across the country. We are born in such a great era. How should we meet the demands of such a great era? From the perspective of people like us, how can we make ourselves fully play an active role in the Great Leap Forward?

I think the most important point is that everyone, especially some people, must accept the leadership of the Party in their political stance and thinking, look forward to socialism and communism, and gradually and earnestly carry out self-transformation. (Including myself.) The biggest enemy of these people is arrogance and self-importance, and even selfish individualism. Premier Zhou has sincerely pointed out in his report that old intellectuals from the bourgeoisie must carry out Marxist-Leninist studies well, get close to the masses, appropriately participate in physical labor, and thus improve their ideological awareness, give play to their work enthusiasm, thoroughly change their old worldview, and transform themselves into new intellectuals of the working class. The Party gives these people a lot of care in life and work, and also places a lot of expectations on them in terms of unity and education.

Here, I would like to report on some ideological situations recently discovered by the China Democratic National Construction Association in the work of uniting and educating industrialists and businesspeople under the leadership of the Party. Industrialists and businesspeople, after going through the anti-rightist rectification campaign and accepting the Party's gentle education, have participated in learning and labor, and have also heard the leadership say:

"Private parties have also contributed to the Great Leap Forward." - After the Great Leap Forward in several cities, awards were given for the Great Leap Forward, and many private personnel won awards. - Thus, their self-awareness and self-confidence were enlightened, and their mood gradually became comfortable. Their belief in the Party and socialism gradually increased. What to do in the future? Premier Zhou pointed out a way forward for industrialists and businesspeople in his report, that is, to earnestly continue self-education and self-transformation in the work of actively participating in socialist construction. I think this instruction from Premier Zhou is very important. Industrialists and businesspeople, as long as they recognize their political position, still need fundamental transformation. With the determination to strengthen transformation in active service, I hope, and I also believe, that they can work hard under the leadership of the enterprise Party committee and with the help of the worker masses, contribute their skills and ideas, make achievements in the movement to increase production and save money, and dedicate gifts to the great 10th anniversary National Day. (Applause)

The glorious and splendid New China has stood up in the world. The Chinese people, who have undergone extremely arduous tempering, have stood up in the world. 1959 is a year of greater all-people leap forward for the New China, and also a year of greater all-people unity. Today, in the venue of the first session of the Second National People's Congress, where members of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are also attending as observers, I am willing, as a representative and a member, to work with the representatives and members, and as a member of the China Democratic National Construction Association, to work with all the comrades of the association, and also with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, to dedicate all our strength and mobilize all forces to complete the various planned tasks of the great all-round leap forward, to implement the various wise and correct domestic and foreign policies and guidelines well, and to strive to greet the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. (Long and enthusiastic applause)

    辉煌灿烂的中华人民共和国建国第十年
    黄炎培代表的发言主席，各位代表，各位委员：
　　辉煌灿烂的新中国，在中国共产党英明地正确地领导下，在全国各民族各阶层的大团结下，人民群众不断地鼓起冲天干劲，一步又一步跃进，经过了全面大跃进的一九五八年，来一个更大跃进的一九五九年，恰是中华人民共和国建国第十周年。人们只要有眼能看、有耳能听，还有谁不会从过去和现在、从那些国家和我们这些国家铁的事实的鲜明对比下，清清楚楚地认识到今天的新中国已经开始走上消灭剥削、消灭贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的道路上来了呢！必须认定，这就是不可战胜的东风压倒西风的无可辩驳的有力的证明。（热烈鼓掌）
    第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议在毛泽东主席亲临主持下开幕了。中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议也同时召开了。我倾听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年度国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告、彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告以及在政协会议上李维汉副主席的常务委员会工作报告，从上述报告中，我们清清楚楚地了解到：伟大的第一个五年计划期内和第二个五年计划第一年一九五八年的种种成就；伟大的第二个五年计划第二年一九五九年的种种任务；英明而正确的对内对外各种政策方针；以及人民民主统一战线的巩固与扩大，我完全拥护，并且感到说不尽的兴奋！感动！庆幸！（鼓掌）印度扩张主义者清醒点！
    散发荒谬文件违反和平共处原则中国人民能把帝国主义赶出中国更不容许外国势力干涉我国内政
    生活了八十多年的我，经历过清朝皇帝、北洋政府、国民党的黑暗统治，亲眼看到帝国主义怎样狠毒地侵略中国，分裂中国。解放以来，我们国家一天天强盛起来，尤其是去年实现了大跃进，我正在无限兴奋、感动、庆幸中，忽然看到西藏一小撮反动分子，在西藏发动叛乱失败后，又逃到印度去同帝国主义和外国反动派勾结起来，企图搞所谓西藏“独立”的把戏，想把西藏从我们祖国分裂出去，使我感到无比愤慨。（鼓掌）
    西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这是全世界包括印度在内所公认的。西藏反动分子的叛乱和这一叛乱的平定是中国的内政，任何外国不能干涉。（鼓掌）中央人民政府对这一事件的处理方针，周总理在报告中已说得十分清楚，这些措施是十分正确的，我们完全拥护。一个国家内政只能由这个国家自己来处理，这是国与国间相处的基本准则。但是，使我个人感到十分惊异的，本月十八日，在印度的提斯浦尔地方，印度的外交官员散发了一个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，这个声明的内容十分荒谬。这样一个公开攻击中国政府的政治性文件，难道印度官方事先不知道吗？（笑声）长时期以来，西藏反动分子以印度的噶伦堡作为在外国的阴谋活动的中心，西藏叛乱事件发生后，西藏叛乱分子逃跑到印度，受到殷勤招待和热烈欢迎，并且在印度掀起了一片要求所谓西藏“独立”的叫嚣，现在竟能通过印度官方散发这样荒谬的文件。从这一系列的事实中，难道能够找得出有一丝一毫合于和平共处五项原则的地方吗？尼赫鲁总理不是说过，不允许发生使印度同中国的关系为难的事情吗？不是说过不允许在印度进行反对另一个国家的政治活动吗？上述的种种反对中国的政治活动，难道是一个对中国友好的国家所能够容许的吗？（热烈鼓掌）我愿意提醒印度人士注意，如果易地而处，如果印度的这一个或者那一个邻国把他们国家的地方作为反对印度的国外活动中心，要把印度的这一个邦那一个省分裂出去，请问，印度的人民和政府能容忍吗？（鼓掌）在这样一个关系到“五项原则”、关系到中印两国友好关系的严重问题上，如果沿着错误的方向走下去，受损害的只是素以提倡和平共处著称的印度的利益，而高兴的只是殖民主义者。现在，西藏叛乱已经平定，西藏人民正在越来越坚定地同各族人民团结一致，在中国共产党的领导下，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。十年以前，中国人民有力量推翻蒋介石的反动统治，把帝国主义赶出中国，经过十年的伟大建设，中国人民包括西藏人民在内，难道还不能够消灭残余的叛国匪徒吗？（鼓掌）还能够容许外国势力干涉中国内政吗？（鼓掌）奉劝印度的扩张主义者先生们清醒一点吧，帝国主义和国外反动势力分裂中国或者摆布中国内政的时代已经一去不复返了，黑暗的农奴制度必然要消灭，一个民主的和社会主义的新西藏必将出现在中国各民族的大家庭中。（热烈鼓掌）
    今年继续大跃进绝对可能：
    试验由点到面收获当会更大物资分配调度更合理更充分人力作了调整经验更加丰富现在，我愿陈述一些个人对大跃进的看法：
    如果问：接在一九五八年大跃进之后，一九五九年来一个更大跃进，可能不可能呢？我敢肯定地说：绝对可能。至少有三点足够做根据：一是：去年大跃进，很多还是重点试验，从试验中得到了惊人的收获，今年一九五九年点扩为面了，当然收获要更大了。二是：去年大跃进，不少方面限于种种条件，例如工业，某些限于原材料，限于机械设备等等。从去年起已经尽量筹划足够的供应，这在周总理报告中也已经说过。今年一九五九年情况更不同了。种种补充、分配、调度更合理、更充分了。三是：去年人力有些地方还很成问题。经过了人民公社的发展，大量吸集、调整，数量既加大，积累了丰富的经验，由试习进于熟练，质量又提高。因此，今年的情况更将不同于去年。——某些人怀疑于更大跃进的是否可能，是没有了解实际情况。——这次计划，根据现实估计而提出来的一九五九年四大指标，一千八百万吨钢、三亿八千万吨煤、一万零五百亿斤粮食、一亿担棉花，不但可能完成生产任务，还会超额完成任务。这光是重点地说，大跃进是全面的。在“全国一盘棋”形势下，一切都在有计划地整个地密切配合着发展的。是广大的人民群众结合着干部亲自动手。在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线号召之下全面进行的。这些还不够做更大跃进的保证么！
    今后的三个努力方向：
    不断发展生产充分利用资源
    大闹技术革命继续征服自然
    相亲相爱实现共产主义理想
    今后呢，我认为应该是、现在也正是向着下开三个方面努力进行：
    第一方面，有计划地不断地发展生产。在尽量挖掘丰富潜力的号召下，平原地区，发展的余地当然特别多。就农业来说，尽管到达需求足够的时候，还应该采取少种多收的方针，继续争取丰产。此外还有蕴藏无尽富源的山区、边区。这些地方只苦缺乏劳动力。光就江西一省说，有负责同志告我：“江西山区平均每人占可耕地多至四十多亩。”说明如果给予相当多的劳动力，还有那么大的耕地面积可以生产哩。全国扩大范围到农、林、牧、副、渔，富源更是无穷了。我曾经亲眼见到：鸭绿江边的柞蚕林，金沙江上游的木棉林，当时使得生长在江苏产棉、产蚕区域的我，发见祖国这些地方，还有那么美富的资源，大为惊讶。如果把这些加以研究，好好地利用起来，或竟扩大移植起来，在增进人民生活需求的供应上，多么有利！但这还不过是一些例子。
    第二方面，在大闹技术革命号召之下，一个单位，一个地区，几十百种、几千万种技术改革，合理化建议，不断地涌现出来。今后还在大大地继续发展。就我个人接触到的，举几个例子来说：一九五八年三月参观上海申新第六纺织印染厂，那时还是大跃进初期，私方厂长兼总工程师秦德芳受到领导上的鼓励，亲自下厂工作，和工人们共同努力的结果，纱锭每分钟原只二百一十转跃进到三百一十转，在英国仅二百转。最近我们又加速到三百七十转。还知道有的厂达四百转，有的超过四百转。这也只是一个例子。奇迹性的发明，如“静电纺纱”，棉花不须通过清花等手续而自动地纺出纱来，杭州、上海等处都在试验；如“无梭织布”，纱自动地织成布，上海等处几个厂都在试验；如“水力采煤”，利用水泵来提高水的压力，将水冲击煤层来采煤，这样大大地节省了人力、物力。现在许多矿都采用这新法，有四个矿成绩特别高，它们的产量一九五八年年底比一九五七年产量增加了二十六倍。这些都是负责同志这样告我的。说到水力采煤，我心中大大地欣慰，我是在解放以前下过煤井的。在煤井里不到十分钟，空气窒塞着，实在支撑不住。推想到许多许多工人们长日地在煤井里工作，这样高度的惨苦，怪不得那时候煤矿工人死亡率特别高。（大都是矽肺病、煤肺病。）逃亡率也特别高。解放以来，大大改善了矿工劳动条件，水力采煤，是基本上解决了这一问题。此外“沼气发电”，我在杭州看到西湖旁边从淤泥中采取沼气，送入农业展览馆试验给群众看，说明一小时以内，用四点八立方米的沼气，可以开动四十五匹马力的机器。它的功用说不尽了，而它的来源随地可以采取。最近还从报纸上看到上海附近各县随地凿井，利用“天然气”，将来“太阳能”、“原子能”扩大利用起来，大自然的富源，简直是无穷无尽，我们必须认识，技术革命，从今天说来，虽然已经不少发现，还只是万里长征第一步。努力！努力！征服自然，利用自然，改造自然，人类将成为自然界自觉的真正的主宰。（鼓掌）
    第三方面，在党领导下，走上各尽所能，按劳分配的社会主义道路了，还望着各尽所能，按需分配的共产主义道路前进，因而逐步改变人与人的关系。中国人很早就有一种理想：“人不独亲其亲，不独子其子。”“货恶其弃于地也，不必藏诸己；力恶其不出于身也，不必为己。”（这不是义务劳动么！）“谋闭而不兴，（没有囤积居奇了。）盗窃乱贼而不作。”要做到这些，基本在于做到“幼有所长，壮有所用，老有所养，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养。”要首先解决他们这些生活问题。可是，说来尽管头头是道，那一个时代，那一种社会，曾经实现过呢！到现在我们明白了。这些绝对不能希望于封建社会、资本主义社会的。中国解放了。十年以来，面貌一步步在改变：一九五五年我首先在杭州看到大群男女义务劳动。一九五八年八月二十日人民日报写着一个惊人的标题：“八无”。什么八无呢？无人管理下（1）售饭菜、（2）发工资、（3）工具收发、（4）图书收发、（5）游艺室用具收发、（6）收会费、（7）售电影票、（8）售洗澡票，是发见于齐齐哈尔市建华机械厂的。我在一九五八年从各地人民公社看到甲社发动很多劳动力去支援乙社，这种种现在已经随处可以看到。
    从此，我的、你的、他的界线虽然不可能一下子消灭，但这些线条，已在渐渐地冲淡了。今后，人与人间，趋向于相亲相爱、相助相让、相规相劝，而不再像过去玩弄种种手段，你欺我诈，甚至你抢我夺了。当然，这些不过是良好的开始。
    这三个方面，靠什么来联系发展呢？就是人民公社。
    只有人民公社吸集、调节了人力、物力，来有计划地尽量地发展生产；只有人民公社充分发挥每个人的聪明和群众集体的智慧，无穷地不断地大搞技术革命；只有人民公社，解决了人民工作问题和物质需求问题，使人们习惯于组织生活、集体生活，很自然地逐步改变人与人间的精神面貌。这些事实都摆在面前，这就是培养共产主义的风格。
    对工商业者的希望：
    认清立场下定决心继续改造
    献技献计增产节约做出成绩
    大跃进是我们国家当前形势的特征，也是全国人民意志的反映。我们生在那么大的时代，将怎样迎合那么大的时代要求呢？从我们这样的人来讲，我们怎样使自己在大跃进中充分发挥积极因素呢？
    我认为最重要的一点：就是每个人特别是某些人的政治立场和思想，必须接受党的领导，望着社会主义、共产主义，逐步地认真自我改造。（包括我个人。）这些人的最大的敌人，就是自高自大，甚至自私自利的个人主义。周总理报告中间已经恳切地指出，大意是资产阶级的旧知识分子，必须好好进行马克思列宁主义的学习，接近群众，适当地参加体力劳动，因而提高自己的思想觉悟，发挥工作的积极性，彻底改变旧有的世界观，改造成为工人阶级的新知识分子。党对这些人在生活和工作上，是给予很多的照顾的，还从团结和教育上寄予很多的期望的。
    在这里，我愿报告一些中国民主建国会在党的领导下，所负责团结、教育工商业者这一工作上最近发见的思想情况。工商业者经过了反右整风，接受了党的和风细雨的教育，很多参加了学习，参加了劳动，还听到领导上说：
    “大跃进中私方也献出了一分力量，”——若干城市在大跃进后，发跃进奖，不少私方人员得奖。——因而启发了他们的自觉和自信，心情逐渐舒畅了。对党、对社会主义的信仰逐渐提高了。今后怎样做呢？周总理在报告中给工商业者指出一条前进的道路，那就是要在积极参加社会主义建设的工作中认真地继续进行自我教育和自我改造。我认为周总理这一指示是十分重要的，工商业者只要认清自己的政治立场，还需要根本改造。决心在积极服务中加强改造，我希望、我也相信，能够在企业党委的领导和工人群众的帮助下努力工作，献技献计，在增产节约运动中，做出成绩，向伟大的十周年国庆献礼。（鼓掌）
    辉煌灿烂的新中国，在世界上已经站立起来了。经受过极度艰苦地千锤百炼的中国人民在世界上已经站立起来了。一九五九年是新中国全民更大跃进的一年，也是全民更大团结的一年。今天在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议同时还有中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会委员列席参加的会场上，我愿以一个代表和一个委员的身份和代表们委员们一道，以中国民主建国会一个成员的身份和全会同志们一道，还和全国人民一道，在中国共产党、毛泽东主席领导下，大家献出自己所有力量，还调动各方所有力量，为了好好完成伟大的全面大跃进种种计划任务、为了好好执行对内对外英明而正确的种种政策方针，来迎接中华人民共和国建国第十周年伟大的国庆而奋斗。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
