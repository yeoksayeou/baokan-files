So That's It!

　　The foreign news agencies' reports after the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" was published are thought-provoking:

　　An Agence France-Presse reporter reported from New Delhi on the 18th that this statement, "obviously published with the approval of the Indian government," "may have been intentionally chosen to be published at the opening of the National People's Congress in Beijing." "The Indian government's approval of the Dalai's statement is an indirect way of saying something that is difficult to say directly." "It seems that the Chinese authorities hope he will return to Tibet. However, this statement clearly points out to the Chinese government that if it wants the Dalai Lama to return to Tibet, it must make serious concessions."

　　A Reuters reporter reported from New Delhi on the same day: "The Dalai's statement will not surprise the Indian government. It was drafted after several lengthy meetings between Nehru's envoy, Menon, and him in Bomdila." "Some here speculate that China is eager to keep the door open for the Dalai to return, and that India may take action to pave the way for his return if China guarantees full autonomy to the Tibetans." The Reuters reporter also said that it is believed here: "The Dalai Lama and his supporters will not be satisfied with the guarantees of autonomy repeatedly offered by the Chinese, but will strive for complete independence."

　　A Kyodo News reporter also reported from New Delhi on the same day: "Unexpectedly, the Dalai Lama directly condemned Communist China for oppressing Tibet and made it clear that he would not return to Tibet as long as Communist China did not make significant political concessions."

　　Enough, enough, the intentions of the author of the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" and his planners are now clear!

    原来如此！
    在所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”发表之后外国通讯社的报道是耐人寻味的：
    法新社记者18日从新德里报道说，这个“显然是在印度政府的赞同下发表的”声明，“可能是有意选择在北京中国全国人民代表大会会议开幕时发表的”。“印度政府赞同达赖的声明，是想间接地说出一些难于直接说出的东西”。“看来中国当局是希望他回西藏的。可是，这项声明清楚地向中国政府指出，如果它希望达赖喇嘛回到西藏去，必须要作严重的让步。”
    路透社记者同一天从新德里报道说：“达赖的声明是不会使印度政府感到惊讶的。这是在同尼赫鲁总理的使节梅农在邦迪拉举行了若干次长时间的会议以后拟订的”。“这里有些人猜测，认为中国渴望把达赖回去的门敞开，同时如果中国保证给西藏人以充分的自治的话，印度可能采取行动为他回去铺平道路”。路透社记者还说，这里认为：“达赖喇嘛和他的支持者们将不会仅仅满足于中国人再度提出的自治的保证，而将是努力争取完全的独立”。
    共同社记者同一天也从新德里报道说：“出乎意料之外，达赖喇嘛却直接谴责共产党中国压迫西藏，并且表明：只要共产党中国一天不在政治上大大让步，他就一天不打算回西藏去。”
    够了，够了，所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的作者和他的策划者的意图，原来如此！
