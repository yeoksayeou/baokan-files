Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The sowing progress of spring wheat in the northern spring wheat region this year is fast and the quality is good. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture as of April 13th, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and the three northeastern provinces and the five northwestern provinces and regions have sown 35 million mu of spring wheat, completing 68.4% of this year's spring wheat planting area plan. Heilongjiang Province, which has the largest spring wheat planting area, has sown 11 million mu, 500,000 mu more than originally planned. Jilin Province has sown 2.25 million mu, 450,000 mu more than originally planned. Gansu Province, which had the highest average spring wheat yield per mu last year, has sown 8.46 million mu, completing 85% of this year's spring wheat planting area plan. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has sown more than 4 million mu, completing more than 50% of this year's spring wheat planting area plan. Areas that have not yet completed spring wheat sowing are now rushing to sow.

This year, many counties and people's communes in the major spring wheat regions of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Gansu provinces and regions have transferred responsible cadres to organize spring wheat sowing command posts to specifically guide the spring wheat sowing work. Therefore, the sowing progress has been accelerated and the sowing quality has been improved. The spring wheat sowing in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces this year was more than 20 days earlier than in previous years. The Party secretaries of many counties and people's communes in Liaoning Province personally planted spring wheat experimental fields to gain experience and held on-site meetings in the experimental fields to study and formulate spring wheat sowing technical regulations. As a result, the province completed the spring wheat sowing task in more than 20 days. The production teams of the Fifth Regiment Farm of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, under the slogan "Break through the first barrier, sow first, work hard and skillfully, increase work efficiency, ensure quality, and strive for time," launched a spring wheat sowing competition. Therefore, the entire farm's spring wheat sowing task was overfulfilled in only ten days.

This year, people's communes in various spring wheat areas are striving to make the spring wheat yield per unit area catch up with winter wheat. For this reason, the spring wheat sowing quality has been greatly improved compared with previous years. According to inspection, the spring wheat fields in general areas have been deeply ploughed more than seven inches, about 10,000 jin of base fertilizer has been applied per mu, and the sowing amount per mu is 30 to 40 jin. Heilongjiang Province is carrying out spring wheat sowing in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. Spring wheat is sown in the land turned over last summer and autumn, with about 10,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu, and the seeds are disinfected. In Liaoning Province, spring wheat is generally planted on land that has been deeply ploughed more than one foot, and the base fertilizer applied per mu is increased by half to one time compared with last year. All of the more than 4 million mu of spring wheat sown in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been sown in land that was deeply ploughed last autumn, and more than half of it is sown in basic farmland that guarantees harvest despite drought or flood. Generally, about 10,000 jin of fertilizer is applied per mu, which is one to three times more than last year, and the area of improved varieties reaches more than 80%. Moreover, various places have accepted the experience of winter wheat sowing last autumn and winter, and there is no excessive close planting.

At present, areas where spring wheat has been sown are organizing professional teams for wheat field management to go deep into the fields to carry out wheat field management. Topdressing is carried out for those with insufficient fertilizer, suppression and crushing are carried out for those with rough and uneven land, ditch irrigation is carried out for those that are dry, and seedling checking and replanting are carried out for wheat fields that have emerged, striving for full, neat, and strong seedlings, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest.

### 春麦播种又快又好  种完之后立即加强田间管理

　　春麦播种又快又好
　　种完之后立即加强田间管理
    新华社17日讯　北方春麦区今年的春小麦播种进度快，质量好。据农业部截至4月13日不完全统计，河北、山东、山西、内蒙古以及东北三省和西北五省、区已播种春麦三千五百万亩，完成今年春麦种植面积计划的68.4％。春麦种植面积最大的黑龙江省，已播一千一百万亩，比原计划多种五十万亩，吉林省已播种二百二十五万亩，比原计划多种四十五万亩，去年春麦平均亩产量最高的甘肃省，已种八百四十六万亩，完成今年春麦种植面积计划的85％，内蒙古自治区已播种四百多万亩，完成今年春麦种植面积计划的50％以上。目前没有完成春麦播种的地区，正突击播种。
    今年，主要春麦区黑龙江、内蒙古、甘肃等省、区的许多县和人民公社都抽调负责干部，组织春麦播种指挥部，具体指导春麦播种工作的进行。因此，加快了播种进度，提高了播种质量。黑龙江和吉林两省今年春麦播种比往年提早了二十多天。辽宁省许多县和人民公社的党委书记亲自种春麦试验田取得经验，在试验田召开现场会议，研究制定春麦播种技术规程，因而全省用二十多天的时间就完成了春麦播种任务。新疆军区生产建设兵团五团农场的各生产队之间，在“冲破头关，播种当先，苦干巧干，工效加番，保证质量，争取时间”的口号下，开展了播种春麦竞赛，因此，只用十天的时间就超额完成了全场春麦播种任务。
    今年，春麦区各地人民公社都要争取春麦单位产量赶上冬麦，为此春麦播种质量比往年大大提高。据检查证明，一般的地区春麦田都深耕七寸以上，每亩施底肥一万斤左右，每亩播种量三十斤到四十斤。黑龙江省是按农业“八字宪法”的要求进行春麦播种的，春麦播种在去年伏翻地和秋翻地里，每亩施了一万斤左右的肥料，种子经过消毒。辽宁省春麦一般都是种在深翻一尺以上的土地上，每亩施底肥比去年增加半倍到一倍。内蒙古自治区已播种的四百多万亩春麦，全部种在去年秋季深耕过的地里，并且有一半以上是种在旱涝保丰收的基本农田上，一般每亩施肥一万斤左右，比去年增加了一倍到三倍，良种面积达到80％以上。而且各地接受了去秋冬麦播种的经验，没有过度密植的现象。
    目前，春麦已播种的地区，正组织麦田管理专业队伍深入田间进行麦田管理。肥料不足的进行追肥，土地平整粗糙的进行镇压破碎，干旱的开沟灌水，已出苗的麦田进行查苗、补苗，力争苗全、苗齐、苗壮，为丰收打下基础。
