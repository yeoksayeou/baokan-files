Chairman, fellow committee members:

I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Minister Li Weihan's "CPPCC Work Report," and the reports of the two vice premiers. These four reports summarize the achievements of our country in various fields over the past few years, especially the brilliant achievements since the Great Leap Forward last year, and also point out the direction for future work. I pledge to conscientiously implement the spirit of these four reports in my future work.

In recent years, especially after the rectification movement, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the Great Leap Forward last year, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have been advancing at an unprecedentedly rapid pace in all aspects, and many new people and new things have emerged. All the facts have powerfully refuted the absurd remarks of the bourgeois rightists who said that the Party cannot lead the construction of our country, and proved that the Party is capable of leading our people to build our own country. Moreover, only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, can our poor and backward old China be built into a prosperous and strong new China. Today, we are proud that our country has the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

I am a health education worker in Jiangxi. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, Jiangxi's health education work, like other aspects, has also seen many new things emerge. These were unimaginable in the past, and I am deeply moved by these new things. Here, I would like to briefly introduce one or two of the countless new things I have recently come into contact with in my work and seen in other areas:

    **Health Undertakings Spread to Townships**
    **Medical Standards Significantly Improved**

Last year, the leaders of Jiangxi Province's health education proposed that teachers and students of medical colleges should go down to the countryside to carry out the great work of eliminating pests and diseases. The teachers and students of Jiangxi Medical College enthusiastically responded to this call and went to the countryside. In February and March of this year, I participated in an inspection team organized by Jiangxi Medical College to check on the situation of students going down to the countryside. The results of this inspection were very satisfactory and gratifying. Not only were the teachers and students exceptionally enthusiastic in eliminating the six diseases, checking and treating the six diseases selflessly every day, but they also diligently and actively engaged in labor in the countryside. At present, many areas have basically eliminated several major diseases (schistosomiasis and hookworm, etc.) that endanger people's health. When peasants suffering from critical illnesses were cured by them, the peasants gratefully said, "You are doctors sent by Chairman Mao." Based on the current situation, I personally believe that it is entirely possible to eliminate the six diseases throughout Jiangxi Province as a gift to this year's National Day. Teachers and students in the countryside have also learned a lot of agricultural knowledge from the peasants and learned the peasants' diligent and conscientious spirit of labor. They unanimously reported that this descent not only combined professional work with work that benefited the people's health but also tempered their thinking. Facts have also proved that the thinking of teachers and students has indeed undergone a great degree of change and improvement compared to the past. This fully demonstrates that the Party's policy of sending intellectuals down to the countryside to reform them is wise and correct. Through labor, intellectuals can take the path of being both red and expert. When I went to the countryside, I saw many moving new things in the countryside. In a very short period of time in the Nanlou People's Commune of Yongyang Town, Ji'an County, I saw that the peasants of the People's Commune were not only disciplined in their work but also very orderly in their lives, ringing gongs every day to mark work and rest, changing the peasants' laxity of thousands of years. Such a situation can be seen in other townships as well. This new atmosphere is one of the favorable guarantees for changing our country's backward countryside into a prosperous paradise. The peasants' lives have also been greatly improved. Taking clothing as an example, the peasants who could not easily afford even a torn piece of clothing before liberation are now all dressed very well. Of course, other aspects have also improved greatly. I am just using clothing as an example. While checking the work, I also learned about the people's hospitals in some counties and townships. From my understanding, our country's health undertakings have spread to every county and every township, and the county and township hospitals have quite good medical equipment and a relatively high level of medical technology. For example, the Ganzhou Administrative Office Hospital can now perform mitral valve surgery and splenorenal shunt surgery, which could not be done anywhere in the country before liberation. Another example is Suichuan County, a relatively small county town, which already has a hospital with a medium-sized X-ray machine. This hospital can perform major surgeries such as splenectomy, which could not be done even in provincial hospitals in the past. Many township people's hospitals also have considerable equipment and can perform considerable surgery, so that farmers do not need to travel long distances to large cities for medical treatment due to illness, and they are guaranteed to receive timely medical treatment. How exciting this is! All of this was unimaginable in the past and can only appear today under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    **Great Achievements Have Been Made in Developing the Legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine**

I will now talk about the achievements of the health education sector in Jiangxi Province in developing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. These achievements are also worth celebrating. The Party Central Committee had already given instructions on developing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and in November 1958, the Party Central Committee once again gave clear instructions on this issue. The Jiangxi health sector, like the health sectors of other provinces and cities across the country, conscientiously studied these instructions and implemented their spirit into practical work, achieving great results. Here, the achievements of the Second Affiliated Hospital of our Jiangxi Medical College alone are very valuable. According to statistics, since the end of last year, acupuncture has been widely used to replace surgery for appendicitis, eliminating patients' fear and pain of surgery. Acupuncture was used instead of anesthesia for 18 types of ENT surgeries, totaling 546 cases, breaking the mysterious view that surgery requires anesthesia. According to patients who have undergone other types of anesthesia in the past, the effect of acupuncture anesthesia is more comfortable than other anesthesia. Mutes and deaf people were treated with acupuncture, and after acupuncture treatment, they were able to speak and hear. The orthopedics department cooperated with the traditional Chinese medicine surgery department to experiment with willow branch bone grafting in two cases, both of which were successful. The experimental diagnostic department used Polygonum multiflorum to create a culture medium. In addition, the comrades further developed the spirit of daring to think and dare to do, using distilled water acupoint injection to treat appendicitis, with very good results; and in the creation of medical equipment, they created a multi-purpose meridian explorer. Great achievements have also been made in other hospitals. These achievements do not exist in other countries in the world. It has brought greater confidence to everyone in learning traditional Chinese medicine and brought good news to patients. This fully shows that the Party's policy on developing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine is correct. Medical personnel must work harder in the future to implement this policy, so that the rich experience and theoretical knowledge of the Chinese people in fighting diseases for thousands of years can be further developed, and make it bloom more brightly in today's medical work.

The above are only a few of the great achievements made in Jiangxi's health education undertakings in recent years and since the Great Leap Forward last year. I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have also achieved great success in various undertakings. For the bright future of our motherland, let us muster soaring enthusiasm in different work posts and strive for more brilliant achievements in 1959. Finally, I wish the conference success and wish all committee members good health.

专栏：

    江西卫生教育工作中的新事物
    胡献尚委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”、李维汉部长的“政协工作报告”，和两位副总理的报告，这四个报告总结了几年来我国各方面的成绩，尤其是去年大跃进以来所取得的辉煌成就，并且还给今后的工作指出了方向，我表示我一定在今后工作中认真贯彻执行这四个报告的精神。
    几年来，特别是经过整风运动、反右斗争和去年的大跃进，我国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在各方面都以人类历史上前所未有的飞跃速度前进着，出现了许多新人和新事物，一切事实都有力的反击了过去资产阶级右派分子说党不能领导我国建设的荒谬言论，并证明了党是能够领导我国人民建设自己祖国的，而且我国只有在以马列主义和毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党领导下，才可能把贫穷落后的旧中国建设成繁荣富强的新中国，今天我们为祖国能有中国共产党的领导而感到骄傲。
    我是在江西从事卫生教育的工作者，近几年来江西卫生教育工作在党的领导下，和其它各方面一样也涌现出了许多新事物，这些在过去是不可想像的，我为这些新事物所深深感动。这里，我想就最近我工作中所接触到的和在其它方面所看到的无数新事物约略举其一二介绍如下：
    卫生事业普及乡镇
    医疗水平显著提高
    去年江西省卫生教育领导提出医学院老师、学生下放农村进行伟大的除害灭病工作。江西医学院的老师和同学热烈响应这一号召，去到了农村。今年二、三月间，我参加江西医学院组织的一个检查同学下放情况的检查团，去到赣南各地。这次检查的结果令人非常满意和感到高兴，老师和同学们不仅在除六病中情绪异常高涨，每天忘我地对六病进行检查和治疗，并且还在农村认真地主动地进行劳动。目前有许多地区已基本上消灭了危害人民健康的几种主要疾病（血吸虫和钩虫等）。当患了危重疾病的农民经他们给治疗好了的时候，农民感激地说：“你们是毛主席派来的医生”。根据目前情况来看，在江西省全省内将消灭六病作为向今年国庆的献礼，我个人认为是完全有把握的。老师和同学们在农村还向农民学习了不少农业方面的知识和学习农民勤勤恳恳的劳动精神。他们一致反映，这次下放既结合业务进行了有益于人民健康的工作，又锻炼了自己的思想。事实也证明，老师和同学们的思想确实与以往有了很大程度的改变和提高。这充分说明党对于改造知识分子的下放政策是英明正确的，通过劳动能够使知识分子走向又红又专的道路。在我去到农村时，我看到了农村许多叫人感动的新事物，当在吉安县永阳镇南楼人民公社的很短时间内，见到人民公社的农民们，不仅在工作上有纪律，在生活上也非常有秩序，每天鸣锣作息，改变了几千年来农民散漫的现象，像这样的情形在其它乡也都可以看到。这种新气象是将我国落后的农村改变成繁荣的乐园的有利保证之一。农民的生活也有了很大的提高，就穿衣一项来说，解放前连一件破衣裳都不容易穿上的农民，今天却都穿得很好。当然，其它方面也同样有很大提高，我只不过以穿衣来说。在检查工作的同时，顺便了解了一些县和乡镇的人民医院。从了解中看出，我国的卫生事业已普及到每个县和每个乡镇，而且在县和乡镇医院中都已具有相当好的医疗设备和较高水平的医疗技术。例如，赣州行署医院现在可以做解放前全国所不能做的心脏二尖瓣手术和脾肾静脉吻合手术。又如在一个县城较小的遂川县，已经有一个具有中型X光机的医院，这个医院能够做脾切除之类的较大手术，这种手术在过去连省立医院也是不能做的。有许多镇人民医院也有相当设备，也能做相当手术，这样不仅使农民不需因病走许多路去到大城市，并且保证了农民能及时得到医疗，这是多么令人兴奋的事。这一切在过去是想像不到的，只有在党和毛主席领导下的今天才能出现。
    发扬祖国医学遗产已经获得很大成绩
    我再谈一下江西省卫生教育界在发扬祖国医学遗产方面的成就，这些成就也是值得高兴的。党中央早已对发扬祖国医学遗产有过指示，一九五八年十一月党中央再一次对这问题作了明确的指示。江西卫生界和全国各省市卫生界一样，认真地学习这一指示，并将它的精神贯彻到实际工作中，取得了很大的成绩。这里仅就我们江西医学院第二附属医院的成绩来说，便是非常宝贵的。根据统计，自去年年底以来，已普遍将针灸代替阑尾炎的开刀手术，灭除了病人对手术的恐惧和痛苦。用针刺代替麻药进行眼耳鼻喉科手术十八种共五百四十六例，打破了过去开刀要定麻药的神秘观点。根据过去受过其它麻醉的病人反映，针刺麻醉的效果比其它麻醉更为舒服。哑吧和聋子施用针刺，经针刺治疗后能够说话能够听到声音了。矫形外科与中医外科合作，实验柳枝接骨二例都获得成功。实验诊断科用何首乌制造了培养基。此外，同志们进一步发挥了敢想、敢干的精神，用蒸馏水穴位注射医治阑尾炎，疗效非常好；还在医疗器械的创制中，制成了多用经络探索器。在其它医院也同样取得了很大的成绩。这些成就在世界其它各国都是没有的，它给大家学习中医带来了更大的信心，给病人带来了福音。这充分说明，党关于发扬祖国医学遗产的政策是正确的，医务人员今后必须更加努力地来贯彻这一政策，让祖国人民几千年同疾病作斗争的丰富经验和理论知识得到更大的发挥，使它在今天的医疗工作中开放更鲜艳的花朵。
    以上仅是近几年和去年大跃进以来江西卫生教育事业所取得的伟大成绩中的点滴。我深信我国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在各项事业中都同样取得了很大的成绩。为了祖国的美好前景，让我们在不同的工作岗位上鼓起冲天的干劲，为争取一九五九年的更辉煌的成就而努力。最后谨祝大会成功，并祝各位委员身体健康。
