Comrades of the Presidium, fellow delegates:

    I fully support the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I am determined to implement them resolutely.

    1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward for our country's socialism, a year of double harvests in production and ideology. In this year, the spiritual outlook of our people underwent significant changes, production and construction leaped forward at an astonishing pace, new things emerged everywhere, miracles occurred every day, and the extraordinary was born from the ordinary. All of this was the result of liberating our minds and breaking down superstitions.

    In this great era of the motherland, where "one day equals twenty years," our Lushun factory, like other factories and mines across the country, under the correct leadership of the Party, and through the great rectification campaign, the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement, and the education of the Party's general line for socialism, greatly liberated our thinking, established a communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, and the communist spirit of cooperation of "I for everyone, everyone for me." Especially inspired by the call to take steel as the key link, which was put forward at the Beidaihe Conference, everyone was spirited and full of fighting spirit. Under the correct leadership of the Party, a vigorous upsurge in the Great Leap Forward in production was launched. The workers held high the red flag of putting politics in command, going wherever the Party pointed, and everyone worked hard, practically, and skillfully with a fighting attitude of "seizing every second." "Thinking while eating, thinking while sleeping, clever work has clever generals," is not only a poem written by the workers in the Great Leap Forward, but also a vivid portrayal of the workers' soaring enthusiasm in our factory. Thanks to the workers' heroic spirit and vigorous revolutionary drive, a great harvest was achieved on the production front. In 1958, our factory victoriously completed the annual leap forward plan forty-five days ahead of schedule; the ship repair cycle was generally shortened by 40% to 50%; and in the major overhaul of the "Olchan" ship, the task was victoriously completed three months ahead of schedule. In order to ensure that the "steel commander" would rise to power as soon as possible, the workers overcame numerous difficulties with a spirit of great effort, hard work, and skillful work, and completed the metallurgical equipment for the 300-cubic-meter blower one month ahead of schedule. In addition, we also trial-produced a large number of new products.

    Our victory in 1958 was not smooth sailing, but was achieved in the struggle against difficulties. When there was a shortage of materials and electricity supply, a mass movement for steel and electricity drought resistance was launched. With the concerted efforts of all the workers in the factory, 2,408 tons of iron, steel, and metal materials were extracted, and 2,787.6 kilowatts of electricity were self-generated, which not only solved the factory's own electricity needs, but also supported the city's electricity supply with 34,200 kilowatt-hours. When equipment and materials were insufficient, a vigorous technical revolution was launched and satellite factories were established. A total of 126 sets of indigenous and foreign equipment were manufactured throughout the year, 97 sets were put into production, and 26 tons of steel were saved. The shortage of labor was also solved by developing versatile workers and carrying out extensive cooperation. Therefore, it can be said that the victory in 1958 was achieved by the working class with their own hands, using labor, wisdom, and a tenacious struggle against difficulties. This further encouraged the enthusiasm of our workers and strengthened our confidence in fighting against difficulties.

    The achievements of the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958 were very great, but our workers felt that they were not satisfied. Especially when we saw that the Party Central Committee pointed out in the communiqué of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee that in order to accelerate the pace of our country's Great Leap Forward, there would be a greater leap forward in 1959, the workers' hearts were as happy as blooming flowers, because we deeply felt that this communiqué was not only a more magnificent blueprint for the leap forward, but also a concrete reflection of the common will of the people of the whole country. In order to complete this leap forward plan in the decisive year of the three-year hard battle, our workers all expressed their determination to beat the drums of the Great Leap Forward even louder and bravely advance, holding high the banner of victory.

    At the beginning of this year, in conjunction with the discussion of the factory's 1959 leap forward plan, we vigorously launched a socialist labor competition centered on "high output and high quality" and a high-yield month movement for technical revolution. During the movement, the workers' innovations and creations appeared like mushrooms after rain, making production turn over and over again, leap and leap again, turn over and over again, and leap and leap again, thus victoriously completing 105% of the output value target for the first quarter of this year, an increase of 40.9% over the same period last year. In addition, we also overfulfilled the key tasks of 315 sets of drainage and irrigation equipment and a large number of rolling mill collaboration parts, firing the first shot of the Great Leap Forward in 1959 and creating a good start for our factory to overfulfill the leap forward plan this year.

    This victory made us feel that in order to complete the leap forward plan, we must not only have soaring enthusiasm and work hard, but also carry out technical revolution and technical innovation, and work skillfully. For example, in our forging workshop, in the past, when bending crankshafts, it took three shifts of workers twenty-four hours to complete one; after the workers researched and improved the tools, it was later shortened to two shifts of workers sixteen hours to complete one, and now it has been improved from the operation method and labor organization, shortening it to seven hours to complete one. Forging rolling mill gears, initially, one shift could only forge two; we researched and improved the process while working, and the next day it rose to four; but we were not satisfied and continued to research and improve the operating methods, and adopted assembly line operations, and the output increased from four to eight; after such research and improvement while working, turning over and over again, turning over and over again, now one shift can forge fourteen. Although the output has increased so dramatically and doubled, we know that the production potential is infinite. Because we have always believed in this objective truth, we have created the achievement of shortening the forging time of 210-horsepower diesel engine crankshafts from 60 hours to 20 hours, ensuring the early and overfulfillment of the production task. These are only the situations in one of our workshops. If we look at the overfulfillment of the output value in the first quarter of the year in our entire factory, it is not difficult to see the increasing enthusiasm of all the workers. In early March, the daily output value was only 34,000 yuan, but by the middle of the month it reached 45,000 yuan, and in the last ten days of the month it jumped to 61,000 yuan, and finally increased to 101,000 yuan. Where does this rapid change and the workers' unstoppable enthusiasm come from? To this question, we answer that it is because we have the wise leadership of the great Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, which best reflects the wishes of 600 million people. Chairman Mao once said: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before." Although we have encountered many difficulties in production, when we think of this sentence spoken by Chairman Mao, we feel that we have strength, and our enthusiasm is getting bigger and bigger. Chairman Mao told us at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee: "Strategically, we should despise difficulties, and tactically, we should pay attention to difficulties." As long as we do this, we will not be afraid of any difficulties, and we can overcome any difficulties. Therefore, our workers all said: "The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are really our guiding lights, guiding us in the direction of continuous progress." In particular, after studying the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes," we have seen more clearly the happy prospects for our country to move towards communism. Recently, the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party passed the draft national economic plan for 1959. We believe that after this plan is passed and promulgated by this National People's Congress, it will play a huge role in mobilizing the people of the whole country to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan this year. All our workers unanimously propose to ensure that we will give full play to revolutionary enthusiasm, muster greater revolutionary drive, and launch a high tide of production and construction, so as to complete tasks earlier, faster, better, and more economically. Of course, there are still difficulties in front of us, but we will never be arrogant and complacent. Under the leadership of the Party, we will unite as one and work hard, and we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and build our motherland into a great socialist power as soon as possible.

    I wish the conference a success,

    And good health to all the delegates.

    苦干加巧干　生产往上翻
    刘立富代表谈旅顺工人的干劲主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的各项报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    一九五八年是我国社会主义大跃进的一年，是生产思想双丰收的一年。在这一年里，我国人民的精神面貌发生了重大的变化，生产建设一日千里的向前跃进着，到处都有新事物，每天都有奇迹发生，到处都有从平凡中产生不平凡。这一切都是解放思想的结果，都是破除迷信的结果。
    在祖国这样一个“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代里，我们旅顺工厂也和全国其他厂矿一样，在党的正确领导下，全体职工通过伟大的整风、双反运动和党的社会主义总路线的教育，大大的解放了思想，树立了敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格，和“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义协作精神。特别是在北戴河会议提出的以钢为纲的战斗号召鼓舞下，人人精神奋发，个个斗志昂扬，在党的正确领导下，轰轰烈烈地掀起了生产大跃进高潮，职工们高举政治挂帅的红旗，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里，人人都以“分秒必争”的战斗姿态进行苦干、实干和巧干。“吃在想、睡在想、巧活有巧将”、“鸡啼到工厂、三更敲家门”，这不仅是工人在大跃进中写的诗篇，而且也是我厂工人冲天干劲的生动写照。由于职工们这种豪迈的英雄气概和生龙活虎般的革命干劲，从而获得了生产战线上的大丰收。一九五八年，我们工厂提前四十五天胜利地完成了全年跃进计划；修船周期普遍地缩短了百分之四十到百分之五十，在大修“奥尔昌”轮时，提前三个月胜利地完成了任务。为了保证钢帅早日升帐，职工们以大干、苦干、巧干精神突破重重难关，提前一个月完成三百立方米鼓风机的冶金设备。此外，我们还试制了大批新产品。
    我们一九五八年的胜利，并不是一帆风顺的，而是在与困难作斗争中取得的。材料、电力供应不足，就发起群众性的钢铁抗旱和电力抗旱运动，在全厂职工一致努力下，挖掘出来二千四百零八吨钢铁和金属材料，自办电力二千七百八十七点六瓩，不仅解决了本厂用电，而且还支援了全市用电三万四千二百度。设备、材料不足，就轰轰烈烈地大闹技术革命，大办卫星厂，全年共制造了土、洋、简各种设备一百二十六台，投入生产九十七台，节约钢材二十六吨。也用开展多面手和大搞协作的方法解决了劳动力不足的困难。因此，可以说，一九五八年的胜利是通过我们工人阶级的双手，用劳动、智慧与困难作顽强的斗争中取得的。这就进一步鼓舞了我们工人的干劲，更加坚定了向困难作斗争的信心。
    一九五八年的生产大跃进的成绩是很大的，但是我们工人觉得还不满足，特别当我们看到党中央在八届六中全会公报中指出的，为加速我国大跃进步伐，在一九五九年要来一个更大跃进的消息时，工人心里都像开了花一样高兴，因为我们深深感到这个公报不仅是一幅向前跃进的更加宏伟的蓝图，而且也是全国人民共同意志的具体反映。为了完成这个在苦战三年中具有决定性一年的跃进计划，我们工人都表示，决心要把大跃进的战鼓敲得更响，高举胜利红旗奋勇前进。
    今年初，我们就结合讨论一九五九年工厂跃进计划，轰轰烈烈地开展了以“高产、优质”为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛与技术革命高产月运动。在运动中，工人的革新创造好似雨后春笋般的出现，使生产一翻再翻、一跃再跃、番上加番、跃上加跃，从而胜利地完成了今年第一季度产值指标的百分之一百零五，比去年同一时期增长了百分之四十点九。此外，还超额完成三百一十五台排灌设备和大批轧钢协作件的重点任务，打响了一九五九年大跃进的第一炮，为我厂今年超额完成跃进计划创造了一个良好的开端。
    这个胜利，使我们感到要想完成跃进计划，既要有冲天的干劲，要苦干；又要进行技术革命和技术革新，要巧干。如今年初，我们锻工车间过去在弯曲拐轴时，三个班干二十四小时才能完成一个；经过工人研究改进了工具，后来缩短到两个班干十六小时完成一个，而现在又从操作方法和劳动组织上改进，缩短到七个小时就可完成一个。锻造轧钢机齿轮，最初一个班只能锻两个；我们边干边研究，改进了工艺，第二天就上升到四个；但是我们还不满足，继续研究改进操作办法，并采取了流水式作业，产量又从四个提高到八个；经过这样边干边研究，一翻再翻、番上加番，现在一个班可以锻造十四个了。产量虽然是这样飞跃地上升，成倍地提高，但是我们知道，生产潜力是无穷的。由于我们始终相信这一客观真理，我们在锻二百一十匹马力柴油机曲轴时，又创造了由六十小时缩短到二十小时的成绩，保证提前超额地完成了生产任务。这些仅是我们一个车间的情况，如果从我们全厂超额完成第一季度的产值来看，就不难看出全厂职工越来越大的干劲，在三月份上旬日产值只有三点四万元，可是到中旬就达到四点五万元，下旬又跃到六点一万元，最后增加到十点一万元。这种日新月异的变化，我们工人这种锐不可挡的冲天干劲，是从何而来的呢？对于这个问题，我们回答说，就是因为我们有了最能体现六亿人民心愿的伟大的党中央和毛主席的英明领导。毛主席曾经说过：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”虽然我们在生产中曾经遇到过许多难关，但是，当我们一想起毛主席所讲的这一句话时，就感到有了力量，干劲就越来越大。毛主席在八届六中全会告诉我们：“在战略上要藐视困难、在战术上要重视困难”，只要做到这样，就什么困难都不怕，什么困难都能克服。因此，我们工人都说：“党中央和毛主席真是我们的指路明灯，指引我们不断前进的方向”。特别是通过学习“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”后，更清楚地看到了我国通向共产主义的幸福前景。最近，在党的八届七中全会上，又通过了一九五九年国民经济计划草案。我们相信这一计划在这次人代会通过公布后，将会对动员全国人民为实现今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进计划起到巨大的作用。我们全体职工一致提出保证：要充分发挥革命的积极性，鼓足更大的革命干劲，掀起生产建设高潮，来更多、更快、更好、更省地提前完成任务。当然，在我们面前也并不是没有困难的，但是我们决不骄傲自满，在党的领导下，我们团结一致，一股劲干下去，我们一定能战胜困难，一定能够早日把祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义强国。
    祝大会胜利，
    各位代表身体健康。
