    Correspondence Course Class
    Poem by Tianma
    Painting by Fang Cheng
    An American science magazine published an advertisement: "The world's only correspondence course for professors who eavesdrop on telephone conversations is enrolling students..." Having a mouth but no freedom of speech, looking ahead and behind, fearing disaster is imminent. Even making a phone call feels awkward; you call, they eavesdrop, specifically looking for flaws. Spies are as numerous as hairs on an ox, and they still feel it's not enough people, so they are running a correspondence course to train new recruits. This kind of correspondence course is rare in the world, teaching the method of eavesdropping on phone calls, one by one. There are hundreds of millions of people in America, each with a mouth, and they all know how to speak, how could eavesdropping be enough! Why not come up with an invention, design a new switch, so that with just the press of a hand, everyone will shut up!

    美国的一本科学杂志刊登了一则广告：“世界上唯一的教授偷听电话谈话的函授班招生……”空长一张嘴，说话不自由，瞻前又顾后，恐怕祸临头。就是打电话，也觉很别扭，你打他偷听，专门找差漏。特务像牛毛，还嫌人不够，办个函授班，训练新人手。这种函授班，世间还少有，偷听电话法，一一来传授。美国亿万人，嘴巴个个有，都会把话说，偷听岂能够！何不搞发明，设计新电钮，只要手一按，大家都住口！
