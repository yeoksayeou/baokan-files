To Adapt to Unified Leadership and Decentralized Management
    Chengbo Commune Party Committee Improves Leadership Methods

    (Reported by Henan Daily) The Chengbo People's Commune Party Committee in Meng County has improved its leadership methods during the rectification of the commune, further strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses, and between higher and lower levels. This has mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses and led to new developments in both work and production.

    This commune has 5,200 households, over 21,000 people, and over 50,000 mu of cultivated land. In the work of rectifying and consolidating the commune, the commune Party committee, according to the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party regarding "the people's commune should implement a system of unified leadership and decentralized management," divided the brigades into 67 production teams; each brigade established a Party branch, and production teams established Party groups. To adapt to this new situation and strengthen the Party's leadership over the commune, the commune Party committee and brigade Party branches adopted the following measures: First, streamline management agencies, delegate cadres, and strengthen leadership at the team level. The commune transferred a total of 52 cadres to the production brigades and production teams, including 11 who served as secretaries and deputy secretaries of branches, 13 as heads and deputy heads of brigades, and 9 as heads and deputy heads of teams. The Party committee required all cadres to participate in physical labor, leading production through production. The commune used 3,000 mu of high-yield wheat demonstration fields as a base for guiding production. Brigade cadres, except for attending meetings, basically participated in labor all the time. Production team cadres participated in labor full-time. They also fully utilized the leadership methods of the past, such as "six visits to the fields" for meetings, assigning work, formulating plans, inspecting plans, and conducting evaluations, and giving rewards and punishments.

    Second, the secretary took the lead, unifying leadership, clarifying division of labor, and comprehensively combining upper and lower levels. The first secretary of the commune Party committee grasped the overall situation, and the other four secretaries divided into four battle zones to guide the work of the major brigades. Forty-two committee members were assigned to basic accounting units. Brigade branch secretaries were assigned to production teams, and branch committee members were assigned to work groups. Layer-by-layer contracting tied the commune, brigade, and production team together as one. The commune and brigades had regular meeting and evaluation systems, strengthening planning in their work. Every plan and measure had to go through free discussion, so that it would be grasped by every member of the commune.

    Third, improve the democratic life system, vigorously grasp political and ideological work, and launch labor competitions. In terms of establishing and improving the democratic system, the commune Party committee held life meetings once a month, the branch life meetings once every half month, and a general meeting of all Party members in the commune once every half month; the commune established a Party school to train Party members in rotation, the brigades established night Party schools, holding Party classes once every half month; at the same time, they often organized members to hold good life review meetings. Party organizations often understood the ideological situation of cadres and masses, and strengthened ideological education. After each task was determined, Party organizations at all levels studied and determined the content and time of evaluation, organizing competitions between brigades and between production teams. Evaluation and competition campaigns were also carried out among cadres, Party members, and members of the commune.

    Fourth, while focusing on production, arrange the lives of members. The measures were: rectify the canteen organization, transferring Party and Youth League members to work in the canteens; the Party committee secretary and branch secretaries all established canteen "experimental fields," and established a food committee headed by the Party branch secretary to strengthen canteen management; reduce the size of canteens, establishing one canteen for each production team. After doing this, the members were satisfied, and their enthusiasm was even greater.

    The Party organization adopted these measures to improve leadership style and working methods, and quickly achieved significant results throughout the commune. For example, after Chengbo Brigade was identified as a key point, Han Changsheng, deputy secretary of the Party committee, contracted to lead it, and quickly turned the work of this team from average to advanced, winning a red flag. The four major teams in Nandongdian had long lagged behind in their work in the past. After delegating cadres to strengthen leadership and launching evaluations and competitions, preparation for spring plowing, wheat field management, and other tasks were rated as advanced units within half a month. Due to the implementation of unified leadership, decentralized management, and further implementation of the principle of distribution according to work, and with the promotion of cadres participating in labor and leading production through production, the whole commune showed a new atmosphere of more attendance, more early work, more care for public property, more investment by members, and greater unity between cadres and the masses. In the past half month, the whole commune irrigated over 26,000 mu of wheat for jointing, applied fertilizer to 36,000 mu, plowed 6,800 mu for spring planting, and increased labor efficiency by more than 30%.

    适应统一领导、分级管理的情况
    城伯公社党委改进领导方法
    据河南日报消息　孟县城伯人民公社党委会在整顿公社中改进领导方法，进一步密切了党和群众、上级和下级的关系，调动了广大群众的积极性，使工作和生产都出现了新的局面。
    这个公社共有五千二百户，两万一千多口人，耕地五万余亩。在整顿、巩固公社工作中，公社党委根据党的八届六中全会决议关于“人民公社应当实行统一领导、分级管理的制度”的精神，在大队下划分了六十七个生产队；每个大队建立一个党支部，生产队分别建立了党小组。为适应这一新的形势，加强党对公社的领导，公社党委、大队党支部采取了以下措施：首先，精简管理机构，下放干部，充实队级领导。全社共抽出五十二名干部下放到生产大队和生产队，其中担任正副支部书记的十一人，正副大队长的十三人，正副队长的九人。党委要求所有干部都必须参加体力劳动，以生产领导生产。公社以三千亩小麦大面积丰产田为指导生产的基地。大队干部除参加会议外，其余时间基本上全部参加劳动。生产队干部全日参加劳动。并充分运用过去开会、布置工作、制订计划、检查计划、评比、奖惩“六到田”的领导方法。
    其次，书记挂帅，统一领导，明确分工，上下全面结合。公社党委第一书记抓全面，其余四个书记划分四个战区指导各大队工作，四十二个委员分包基本核算单位。大队支部书记包生产队，支部委员包作业组。层层包干，使公社、大队、生产队三级扭成一股绳。公社、大队都有定期碰头、评比制度，在工作中加强计划性，每一个计划、措施都要经过鸣放辩论，使它为每个社员所掌握。
    第三，健全民主生活制度，大抓政治思想工作，开展劳动竞赛。在建立与健全民主制度方面，公社党委生活会议一月一次，支部生活会议半月一次，每一个半月召开全社党员大会一次；公社建立了党校，轮训党员，大队建立夜党校，每半月上党课一次；同时经常组织社员开好生活检讨会。党组织经常了解干部和群众思想情况，加强思想教育。每一个任务确定之后，各级党组织即研究定出了评比内容、时间，组织大队与大队、生产队与生产队开展竞赛。干部、党员、社员之间，也都开展评比竞赛运动。
    第四，在抓好生产的同时，安排好社员生活。措施是：整顿食堂组织，抽出党、团员到食堂工作；党委书记、支部书记人人建立有食堂“试验田”，并以党支部书记为首建立伙食委员会，加强食堂管理工作；缩小食堂规模，每个生产队建立一个食堂。这样作了以后，社员满意，干劲更大。
    党组织采取这些措施，改进领导作风和工作方法，在全社范围内迅速收到了显著效果。如城伯大队被确定为重点以后，党委副书记韩长升包干领导，使这个队的工作很快由一般变为先进，获得红旗。南董点四个大队过去工作长期落后，经下放干部加强领导，并开展评比竞赛以后，在半个月内，春耕准备、麦田管理等工作都被评为先进单位。由于实行了统一领导、分级管理和进一步贯彻执行按劳分配的原则，同时在干部参加劳动、以生产领导生产的推动下，全社出现了出勤多、起早干活的多、爱护公共财产的多、社员投资的多和干部群众更加团结的新气象，半月来全社共浇小麦拔节水两万六千多亩，施肥三万六千亩，春耕六千八百亩，劳动效率提高30％以上。
