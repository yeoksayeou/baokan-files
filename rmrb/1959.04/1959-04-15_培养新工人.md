　　Cultivating New Workers
    In many enterprises, new workers account for a significant proportion, some even making up 75% to 85% or more of the total number of workers. To engage in mass movements in a big way, we must boldly mobilize new workers, allowing them to work with the old workers to fully utilize their initiative and creativity, and use hard work, practical work, and smart work to achieve a great leap forward in production and construction.
    Although the new workers who have joined the industrial front come from all directions, they also come from one place: the socialist society that has been liberated for nine years. They have received long-term education from Party organizations in rural areas, schools, and streets, and in all aspects. In particular, after more than a year of the nationwide rectification movement, they have a certain level of ideological awareness, and many are backbones or activists in various movements. This is the foundation for the rapid growth of new workers. Of course, new workers are, after all, new workers. They have not been tempered by large-scale production, and many have brought some non-proletarian ideological consciousness from other social strata. They are not yet accustomed to the production and life of modern industrial enterprises with a high degree of organization and discipline; a few still have a strong petty-bourgeois ideology and style of work. However, as long as we adopt a positive attitude to educate and transform them, and earnestly carry out socialist and communist education for them, and systematically help them improve their skills, the growth of new workers can be rapid.
    Relying on old workers to educate new workers is an effective method for cultivating new workers. Old workers have received more class struggle training and political education, and their ideological awareness is generally higher; they have cultivated a high degree of organization and discipline in the long-term production of modern industrial enterprises. They are living examples for new workers. Relying on them to unite and educate new workers can enable new workers to improve rapidly politically. In terms of technology, we must also rely on old workers to lead new workers to participate in the battle, allowing old workers to arm new workers with their rich production experience. Organizing old workers to lead new workers to practice on the spot is a good way to rapidly improve the technical level of new workers. In the process of cultivating new workers, we must also give full play to the positive factors in new workers, rely on the advanced figures among new workers, promote the advanced ideas among new workers, and promote mutual promotion and common improvement among new workers through competitions, evaluations, and other methods. The "Five Goods" competition launched by apprentices in Hebei District, Tianjin, is a good form.
    New workers are a force that cannot be ignored in this year's great leap forward in production and construction. We hope that the leaders of industrial and mining enterprises will seize the work of cultivating and educating new workers, so that they can emit full light and heat!

### 培养新工人

　　培养新工人
    在许多企业里，新工人都占了不小的比重，有的甚至占企业工人总数的75％到85％以上。要大搞群众运动，自然就要放手发动新工人，让他们同老工人一起，充分发挥积极性和创造性，用苦干实干巧干的办法，来实现生产建设的大跃进。
    投入工业战线的新工人，虽然来自四面八方，但也是来自一方，这就是来自解放了九年的社会主义社会这一方。他们在农村、在学校、在街道，在各个方面党组织的长期教育下，特别是经过一年多的全民整风运动，都有一定的思想觉悟，不少人还是各个运动里面的骨干或积极分子。这是新工人迅速成长的基础。当然，新工人毕竟是新工人，他们没有经过大生产的陶冶，不少人还从社会其他阶层带来了一些非无产阶级的思想意识，对于有高度组织性纪律性的现代工业企业的生产和生活一时还不习惯；少数人还有较浓厚的小资产阶级思想作风。但是，只要我们采取积极的态度去教育和改造他们，认真对他们进行社会主义共产主义教育，有计划地帮助他们提高技术，新工人的成长可以是很快的。
    依靠老工人教育新工人，是培养新工人的有效方法。老工人受到阶级斗争的锻炼和政治教育比较多，思想觉悟一般都比较高；他们在长时间现代工业企业的生产中，培养起了高度的组织性和纪律性。他们是新工人活生生的榜样。依靠他们去团结和教育新工人，可以使新工人在政治上迅速提高。在技术方面，也要依靠老工人带领新工人参战，让老工人用自己丰富的生产经验来武装新工人。组织老工人带领新工人在现场练兵，这是使新工人迅速提高技术水平的好办法。我们在培养新工人的过程中还要充分发挥新工人中的积极因素，依靠新工人中的先进人物，发扬新工人中的先进思想，通过竞赛、评比等办法，推动新工人互相促进，共同提高。天津市河北区徒工展开“五好”竞赛，就是一种良好形式。
    新工人是今年生产建设大跃进中的一支不可忽视的力量。希望工矿企业的领导人员抓紧对新工人的培养教育工作，让他们发出充分的光和热！
