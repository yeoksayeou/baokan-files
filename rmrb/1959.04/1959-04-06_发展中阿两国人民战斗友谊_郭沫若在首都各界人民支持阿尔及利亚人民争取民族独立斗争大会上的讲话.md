Xinhua News Agency, April 5th. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, delivered a speech at the rally of people from all walks of life in the capital supporting the Algerian people's struggle for national independence. The full text is as follows:

Respected Mr. Omar Oussedik and distinguished members of the Algerian military delegation, friends, comrades!

Today, as our people are enthusiastically launching the "Algerian Week" activities, we, the people from all walks of life in the capital, are holding a grand rally here to express the Chinese people's firm support for the Algerian people's struggle for national independence against imperialism, and to congratulate the Algerian people on the brilliant victories they have achieved in their long-term war of resistance. We are particularly honored to have the distinguished guests of the Algerian military delegation headed by Mr. Omar Oussedik participating in this meeting today. They are representatives of the heroic and skilled Algerian National Liberation Army, and they are staunch fighters against imperialism and for the defense of peace. On behalf of our conference and the 650 million people of our country, I extend my heartfelt and warm welcome to the distinguished guests, and through you, I extend my warmest congratulations and highest brotherly respect to the Algerian people who are engaged in arduous struggles.

Although the Chinese and Algerian people are separated by vast oceans and mountains, the common struggle against imperialism has closely linked our hearts together. We feel particularly sympathetic and concerned about the Algerian people's struggle for national liberation. The Chinese people have always regarded the Algerian people's struggle as their own and the Algerian people's victory as their own, and have been greatly encouraged and supported by the Algerian people's struggle. The Chinese people deeply admire the Algerian people's determination to persevere in the long-term war of resistance and the spirit of perseverance and tenacity they have demonstrated in the struggle, and are proud of the Algerian people's victory.

Since the French imperialists occupied Algeria in 1830, the Algerian people have continuously waged struggles against French colonial rule, especially the armed struggle that began on November 1, 1954, which has dealt a heavy blow to the French colonialists, powerfully demonstrating the great strength and firm will of the Algerian people in their struggle for national independence. Over the past four years, the Algerian people have grown and strengthened in the anti-colonialist flames of war, becoming stronger as they fight. The Algerian National Liberation Army has grown from thousands to over one hundred thousand, becoming an invincible force. In just a few years, they have annihilated as many as 100,000 French invading troops and tied down more than two-thirds of the French army. Last year's establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic marked a new stage in the Algerian national liberation struggle. Under the leadership of the Provisional Government, all anti-war forces in Algeria are united and are launching a more powerful struggle against French imperialism. The Algerian people's experience in successfully persevering in armed struggle has greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence. This shows that the Algerian people are not only fighting for their own independence and freedom, but also making a significant contribution to the struggle of people all over the world to defend peace and oppose imperialism. Therefore, peace-loving and justice-loving people all over the world stand on the side of the Algerian people, admiring, sympathizing with, and supporting the Algerian people's struggle.

Comrades, friends: Our era is an era in which imperialism is heading towards extinction and oppressed nations and peoples are heading towards victory. The struggle for national independence and against colonialism has formed an irresistible torrent in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Especially in recent times, the Arab and African national independence movements are entering a new high tide with great momentum. The heroic Iraqi people have continuously achieved major victories in the struggle against imperialist aggression and for the defense of national independence, and recently crushed the subversive conspiracies of imperialist and domestic reactionary forces, officially announced their withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact, and abolished Britain's privileges in using the Habbaniyah air force base. These victories of the Iraqi people have defended the fruits of the national revolution and seriously dealt a blow to imperialist aggression in the Near and Middle East. The people of Oman are waging a tenacious struggle against British imperialism. The struggle of the Moroccan people demanding the withdrawal of US and French troops and the abolition of military bases is intensifying. The Congo, which was called a "safe oasis" by the colonialists, broke out in a strong struggle against Belgian colonialism at the beginning of this year. Immediately afterwards, the people of Nyasaland and other regions of Central Africa launched a large-scale struggle against British imperialist colonial rule. The African people have awakened, and the African national independence movement is like a prairie fire, spreading throughout the continent. In the situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, and with the support of the powerful socialist countries and peace-loving and justice-loving people all over the world, the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging forward, accelerating the final collapse of the imperialist colonial system. The days when imperialism will completely get out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are coming soon. This situation is obviously very favorable to the Algerian people and unfavorable to French imperialism. Although the French colonialists are currently making a desperate struggle with the economic and military assistance of US imperialism; the de Gaulle government, at the risk of political and financial bankruptcy, is still continuing the cruel colonial war against Algeria, and is attempting to soften and divide the Algerian people with political deception, their conspiracy is doomed to failure. The longer French imperialism stays in Algeria, the tighter the noose around its neck will be drawn, and the more disastrous its failure will be. We firmly believe that as long as the Algerian people are united and carry the war of liberation to the end, final victory will surely belong to the Algerian people.

However, imperialism, especially US imperialism, is carrying out new aggressive conspiracies. The people of Asian and African countries who are striving for and defending national independence must maintain a high degree of vigilance. At present, the United States is feigning sympathy for the national independence movement, and is doing everything possible to split the Asian-African national independence movement from within, and is carrying out various forms of subversion and sabotage. It is especially important to note that after a series of failures in its armed aggression and open interference in Arab countries, US imperialism has turned to more insidious tactics, creating divisions and conflicts between Arab countries, provoking and undermining their mutual relations, and attempting to weaken the anti-imperialist forces in Arabia by means of the despicable tactic of inciting Arabs to fight Arabs, in order to achieve its goal of defeating them one by one. US imperialism is also particularly afraid of the support of the powerful socialist camp for the Arab national independence movement, and is making every effort to provoke relations between Arab countries and socialist countries, attempting to place Arab countries in a state of isolation and helplessness, so that it can continue to enslave and oppress the Arab people. However, the awakened Arab people will never be fooled by the US imperialists. Although some people are intentionally spreading the notion that the Arab countries' anti-imperialist task has come to an end, the Arab people have increasingly realized from their own experience that US imperialism is the most important enemy of the Arab countries; in order to oppose this vicious enemy and to completely realize the task of Arab national liberation, the Arab people still face a serious struggle; it is only possible to win the victory of the struggle if the Arab people are closely united, all Arab anti-imperialist forces are closely united, and all Arab countries are closely united. At the same time, the Arab people's own experience has repeatedly proven that the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union for the Arab national independence movement is one of the important conditions for them to strive for national liberation. The Arab people can clearly see who are their enemies and who are their friends in the international arena. Anyone who attempts to confuse enemies and friends and engage in anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities is violating the fundamental interests of the Arab people. The result of doing so can only benefit imperialism, and will never bring any benefit to their own country and nation, or to themselves. As a loyal friend of the Arab people, the Chinese people sincerely hope that certain discords between Arab countries can be quickly eliminated, that the unity of Arab countries can be further strengthened, and that the friendly and cooperative relations between Arab countries and socialist countries can be further consolidated and developed. As a member of Asian and African countries, the Chinese people sincerely hope that Asian and African countries should further strengthen unity and support each other on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of Bandung. As long as the Asian and African people are united, any aggressive conspiracies of imperialism can be defeated.

Comrades, friends! The Chinese people have suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression for a long time in the past, and are still suffering from US imperialist aggression. We have the same fate and the same experience as the Algerian people, which makes the Chinese people naturally have deep brotherly feelings for the Algerian people. The Chinese people are willing to further develop the militant friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people, and support each other in the common struggle against imperialism. Last year's visit by the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic strengthened the friendly relations between our two countries. The holding of this "Algerian Week" and the visit of the Algerian military delegation will undoubtedly push the friendly relations between China and Algeria to a new stage. We believe that during their visit to China, our Algerian friends will see everywhere the sincere friendship of the Chinese people for the Algerian people. We hope that our dear Algerian friends will bring the deep friendship and sincere congratulations of the Chinese people to our heroic Algerian brothers. We reiterate here that the Chinese people fully support the Algerian people's struggle for national independence against imperialism, and we firmly oppose French imperialism's colonial rule in Algeria. We strongly protest against the atrocities of the French colonialists, and we demand that the French authorities immediately stop the colonial war in Algeria. The Algerian people must achieve complete independence and liberation. We firmly believe that the Algerian people, united and persevering in the war of resistance, will surely win the final victory!

Long live the victory of the Algerian people's struggle for national independence!
Imperialism get out of Africa!
Long live the militant friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people!
Long live the great unity of the Asian and African people!

    发展中阿两国人民战斗友谊
    郭沫若在首都各界人民支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立斗争大会上的讲话
    新华社5日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在首都各界人民支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立斗争大会的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的奥马尔·乌西迪克先生和阿尔及利亚军事代表团的各位贵宾们，朋友们，同志们！
    今天在我国人民热烈展开“阿尔及利亚周”活动的时候，我们首都各界人民在这里举行隆重集会，表示中国人民坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立、反对帝国主义的斗争，并且祝贺阿尔及利亚人民在长期抗战中取得的辉煌胜利。我们特别感到荣幸的是，今天有以奥马尔·乌西迪克先生为首的阿尔及利亚军事代表团的贵宾们参加这个大会。他们是英勇善战的阿尔及利亚民族解放军的代表，他们是反对帝国主义和保卫和平的坚强战士，我代表我们的大会，代表我国六亿五千万人民向贵宾们表示衷心的、热烈的欢迎，并且通过你们，向正在从事艰苦斗争的阿尔及利亚人民表示最热烈的祝贺和最崇高的兄弟的敬意。
    中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民，虽然隔着万水千山，但是，反对帝国主义的共同斗争已经把我们的心紧密地连结在一起，我们对阿尔及利亚人民争取民族解放的斗争感到格外的同情和关切。中国人民从来就把阿尔及利亚人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争，把阿尔及利亚人民的胜利看成是自己的胜利，并且从阿尔及利亚人民的斗争中得到极大的鼓舞和支持。中国人民十分钦佩阿尔及利亚人民坚持长期抗战的决心和他们在斗争中所表现的坚毅顽强的精神，并且为阿尔及利亚人民的胜利感到骄傲。
    自从1830年法帝国主义侵占阿尔及利亚以来，阿尔及利亚人民就不断地进行了反对法国殖民统治的斗争，特别是从1954年11月1日开始的武装斗争，更给了法国殖民者以沉重的打击，有力地显示了阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的伟大力量和坚定意志。四年多来，阿尔及利亚人民在反殖民主义的战火中成长壮大，越战越强。阿尔及利亚民族解放军已经从数千人发展到十几万人，成为一支不可战胜的力量。他们在几年内歼灭了法国侵略军达十万人之多，并且牵制住法国陆军三分之二以上的兵力。去年，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立标志着阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争的新阶段。在临时政府的领导下，阿尔及利亚全国一切抗战力量团结一致，更有力地展开了抗击法帝国主义的斗争。阿尔及利亚人民胜利地坚持武装斗争的经验，大大地鼓舞了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立的斗争。这说明阿尔及利亚人民不仅为自己的独立和自由而战，而且对于全世界人民保卫和平、反对帝国主义的斗争做出了重大的贡献。因此全世界爱好和平与正义的人民都站在阿尔及利亚人民一边，他们非常敬佩、同情和支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。
    同志们，朋友们：我们的时代是帝国主义走向灭亡的时代，是被压迫民族和人民走向胜利的时代。争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的斗争，已经在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲形成不可抵挡的洪流。特别是最近一个时期来，阿拉伯和非洲的民族独立运动正在以浩大的声势进入一个新的高潮。英勇的伊拉克人民在反对帝国主义侵略和维护民族独立的斗争中连续地取得了重大的胜利，最近又粉碎了帝国主义和国内外反动势力的颠复阴谋，正式宣布退出巴格达条约，并且废除了英国利用哈巴尼雅基空军基地的特权。伊拉克人民的这些胜利，保卫了民族革命的果实，严重地打击了帝国主义在中近东的侵略活动。阿曼人民正在向英帝国主义展开顽强的斗争。摩洛哥人民要求美法撤退驻军和取消军事基地的斗争日趋高涨。被殖民主义者称为“安全的绿洲”的刚果，在今年初爆发了反对比利时殖民主义的坚强斗争，紧接着，尼亚萨兰人民和中非其他地区人民又掀起了规模宏大的反对英帝国主义殖民统治的斗争。非洲人民已经觉醒，非洲民族独立运动正如烈火燎原，燃遍了整个大陆。在东风压倒西风的形势下，在强大的社会主义国家以及全世界爱好和平和正义的人民的支持下，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动正在汹涌澎湃地前进，加速着帝国主义殖民体系的最后崩溃，帝国主义从亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲全部滚蛋的日子快要来到了。这种形势显然是十分有利于阿尔及利亚人民，而不利于法国帝国主义。尽管目前法国殖民主义者在美帝国主义的经济和军事援助下还在作垂死的挣扎；戴高乐政府甘冒政治和财政破产的危险，还在继续对阿尔及利亚进行残酷的殖民战争，并且企图用政治诱骗手段来软化和分化阿尔及利亚人民，但是他们的阴谋是注定要失败的。法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚待得越久，套在它脖子上的绞索就拉得越紧，它的失败也就越惨。我们深信，只要阿尔及利亚人民团结一致，把解放战争进行到底，最后胜利一定属于阿尔及利亚人民。
    但是，帝国主义特别是美帝国主义在进行着新的侵略阴谋。正在争取和维护民族独立的亚非各国人民，不能不保持高度的警惕。目前美国正伪装着同情民族独立运动的样子，千方百计地从内部来分裂亚非民族独立运动，进行各种形式的颠覆和破坏活动。尤其值得注意的是，美帝国主义在它对阿拉伯国家的武装侵略和公开干涉遭到一系列的失败之后，又转而采取更加阴险的手法，在阿拉伯国家之间制造分裂和冲突，挑拨和破坏他们相互之间的关系，企图用策动阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人的卑鄙手段，来削弱阿拉伯的反帝力量，达到它各个击破的目的。美帝国主义还特别害怕强大的社会主义阵营对阿拉伯民族独立运动的支持，正在竭力挑拨阿拉伯国家同社会主义国家间的关系，妄图使阿拉伯国家处于孤立无援的地位，以便于它继续奴役和压迫阿拉伯人民。但是，觉醒了的阿拉伯人民是决不会上美帝国主义者的当的。尽管有些人别有用心地放出什么阿拉伯国家反帝任务已经结束的空气，但是，阿拉伯人民从他们切身的经验中，越来越认识到美帝国主义是阿拉伯国家最主要的敌人；为了反对这个凶恶的敌人，为了彻底实现阿拉伯民族解放的任务，阿拉伯人民还面临着严重的斗争；阿拉伯人民紧紧地团结起来，阿拉伯一切反帝力量紧紧地团结起来，阿拉伯各国之间紧紧地团结起来，才有可能争取到斗争的胜利。同时，阿拉伯人民的切身经验，也一再证明了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营对阿拉伯民族独立运动的支持，是他们争取民族解放的重要条件之一。阿拉伯人民可以清楚地看到，在国际范围内，谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。任何人企图混淆敌友，进行反苏反共的勾当，都是违反阿拉伯人民的根本利益的。他们这样做的结果只能有利于帝国主义，而绝不会给自己的国家和民族以及他们自己带来任何好处。作为阿拉伯人民的忠实朋友，中国人民衷心地希望阿拉伯国家之间的某些不和能够迅速地消除，阿拉伯国家的团结能够进一步加强，阿拉伯国家和社会主义国家间的友好合作关系能够进一步地巩固和发展。作为亚非国家的一员，中国人民衷心地希望，亚非各国应该在和平共处五项原则和万隆十项原则的基础上进一步地加强团结，互相支援。只要亚非人民团结一致，帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋都是可以打败的。
    同志们，朋友们！中国人民过去曾经长期遭受帝国主义的侵略和压迫，现在也还遭受着美帝国主义的侵略，我们和阿尔及利亚人民有着共同的命运和共同的遭遇，这使得中国人民自然地对阿尔及利亚人民怀着兄弟般的深厚感情。中国人民愿意进一步发展中阿两国人民的战斗友谊，并且在共同反对帝国主义的斗争中相互支持。去年，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的访问，加强了我们两国之间的友好关系。这次“阿尔及利亚周”的举行和阿尔及利亚军事代表团的访问，无疑地将把中阿两国的友好关系推向一个新的阶段。我们相信，阿尔及利亚朋友们在中国访问期间，到处都会看到中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的这种真挚友情。我们希望亲爱的阿尔及利亚朋友们，能够把中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的深厚友情和衷心祝贺带回给英雄的阿尔及利亚弟兄们。我们在这里再一次地表示，中国人民全力支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立、反对帝国主义的斗争，我们坚决反对法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治。我们严正抗议法国殖民者的暴行，我们要求法国当局立即停止在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争，阿尔及利亚人民必须获得彻底的独立和解放。我们深信，团结一致、坚持抗战的阿尔及利亚人民必定取得最后的胜利！
    阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立斗争的胜利万岁！
    帝国主义滚出非洲去！
    中阿两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    亚非人民大团结万岁！
