Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 12th – The Central Committee Office of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) yesterday evening released a report by the party's General Secretary, D.N. Aidit, regarding his recent visits to the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In the report, Aidit also discussed several issues related to the international and domestic situations.

Aidit first spoke of his impressions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan is a grand and peaceful plan that has won the unanimous support of the Soviet people.

He stated that the Communist Party and people of the Soviet Union are the vanguard in the fight against the bastions of capitalism and imperialism. Since 1917, the imperialist system has suffered heavy blows from the Communist Party and people of the Soviet Union.

Speaking of the movement in China to develop people’s communes, Aidit said that the people's communes are the most suitable organizational form of the Chinese people for building socialism and transitioning to communism in the future. Aidit listed facts to illustrate that the people's communes have already gained the enthusiastic support of the Chinese people. He said that the communes were established according to China's objective needs, and they have organized one-fifth of the world's population.

Aidit said that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan and China's people's commune movement have created new and favorable conditions for the cause of defending world peace, and that the two will greatly strengthen the socialist camp. The strengthening and consolidation of the socialist camp, in turn, means the strengthening and consolidation of the international front against colonialism and for the defense of world peace.

Referring to his visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Aidit pointed out that the struggles of the Indonesian and Vietnamese people have many things in common. He is deeply convinced that the friendship between the two countries will become increasingly close and unbreakable.

In discussing the international situation, Aidit pointed out that the international situation sometimes appears to be turning to the right on the surface, but in reality, it often turns to the left.

He said that the Tibetan rebellion may seem like a bad thing, but on the other hand, after the rebellion is put down, a new page in the history of Tibet will be unfolded. The hope of the reactionaries to restore their rule in Tibet will disappear forever.

Speaking of the Arab situation, Aidit said that the attempts by imperialists and revisionists to create divisions within the international workers' movement and the communist movement have failed, but it seems that Tito's visit to the United Arab Republic (UAR) has successfully turned UAR President Nasser and Iraqi nationalists against each other. This antagonism is not harmful to imperialism, but it is detrimental to the entire movement against colonialism and for the defense of world peace.

Aidit pointed out that there are people in Indonesia who want to establish a government that, on the one hand, pursues an active and independent foreign policy, and on the other hand, pursues a reactionary domestic policy of suppressing workers and the Communist Party, i.e., the kind of policy pursued by Nasser. Aidit said that reality has proven that this is impossible.

Finally, in addressing domestic issues, Aidit called on Indonesian communists to continue to implement the policy of strengthening national unity in order to effectively combat colonialism and imperialism. He said that Indonesian communists should continue to be at the forefront in safeguarding the daily interests of the people.

　　艾地谈访问苏中越三国观感
　　社会主义阵营已经大大加强，同时也意味着反殖民主义、保卫世界和平的国际阵线的加强和巩固
    新华社雅加达12日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会办公室昨天晚上发表了党的总书记艾地最近所作的关于他访问苏联、中国和越南民主共和国的报告。艾地在报告中还谈到有关国际和国内局势的一些问题。
    艾地首先谈到他对苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的印象。他说，苏联的七年计划是一个宏伟的、和平的计划，这个计划赢得了苏联人民的一致支持。
    他说，苏联共产党和人民是打击资本主义和帝国主义堡垒的先锋。自从1917年以来，帝国主义体系已经受到苏联共产党和人民的沉重打击。
    艾地在谈到中国发展人民公社的运动时说，人民公社是中国人民建设社会主义和将来向共产主义过渡的最合适的组织形式。艾地列举事实，说明人民公社已经获得中国人民的热烈支持。他说，公社是根据中国的客观需要建立的，它已经把五分之一的世界人口组织起来。
    艾地说，苏联的七年计划和中国的人民公社运动已经为保卫世界和平的事业创造了新的有利条件，这两者将大大地加强社会主义阵营。而社会主义阵营的加强和巩固又意味着反殖民主义、保卫世界和平的国际阵线的加强和巩固。
    艾地在谈到他对越南民主共和国的访问时指出，印度尼西亚人民和越南人民的斗争有许多共同点。他深信，这两个国家之间的友谊将日益密切和牢不可破。
    艾地在谈到国际形势时指出，国际局势有时表面上看来是向右转，但是实际上常常是向左转。
    他说，西藏叛乱事件看起来好像是一件坏事，但是另一方面，叛乱被平定下去以后，西藏的历史将展开新的一页。而反动派要想在西藏恢复统治的希望将永远消失。
    谈到阿拉伯局势时，艾地说，帝国主义和修正主义者要想在国际工人运动和共产主义运动中制造分裂的活动遭到了失败，但是看来铁托对阿联的访问已经成功地使阿联总统纳赛尔和伊拉克的民族主义者敌对起来。这种敌对对于帝国主义并没有坏处，但是对整个反对殖民主义、保卫世界和平的运动却是有害的。
    艾地指出，在印度尼西亚有人想建立这样一种政府：它一方面奉行积极独立的外交政策，而同时又奉行镇压工人和共产党的反动的对内政策，即纳赛尔所奉行的那种政策。艾地说，现实已经证明，这是不可能的。
    艾地最后在谈到国内问题时，号召印度尼西亚共产党人继续执行加强民族团结的政策，以便对殖民主义和帝国主义进行有效的打击。他说，印度尼西亚共产党人应当继续在维护人民的日常利益方面当先锋。
