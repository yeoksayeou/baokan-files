    Tibet is an Inseparable Part of China's Territory
    Since the armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique was swiftly quelled, the imperialists and foreign reactionary forces, who had long plotted and supported this conspiracy, have been incessantly issuing slanders against the Chinese people in extreme frustration and hatred. They have also clamored "Tibet is not Chinese," "Tibet is an independent country," and so on, attempting to deceive the world public, deny China's sovereignty over Tibet, and conceal their ambition to invade Tibet and interfere in China's internal affairs under the guise of "Tibetan independence." However, lies can never erase facts, and slander can never withstand verification. The Tibetan people have long formed a close brotherly relationship with the people of all ethnic groups in China, especially the Han people, and are members of the motherland's big family. The Tibetan region has long been part of China's territory, becoming an inseparable component of Chinese territory. This is an undeniable fact.
    (I) The Tibetan region has long been an inseparable part of Chinese territory.
    Our country is a large multi-ethnic nation, a unified country jointly created by dozens of ethnic groups, including the Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uygur, and Zhuang, through long-term cooperation. The Tibetan region became a part of the great motherland through a long process of gestation and formation; the Tibetan ethnic group joined the big family of Chinese ethnic groups and developed fraternal relations with the Han and other ethnic groups within China, with a long history. It was precisely in the long-term friendly exchanges, solidarity, and mutual assistance with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, mainly the Han people, and through the test of sharing weal and woe and rescuing each other in times of difficulty, that the Tibetan people made their choice and decision.
    The friendly exchanges between the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, primarily referring to the Han people, began very early. By the seventh century (early Tang Dynasty), the friendly exchanges between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups had greatly developed. In addition to economic and cultural exchanges, close political relations were also established. As is well known, Emperor Taizong of Tang married Princess Wencheng, a member of the imperial family, to the Tubo King Songtsen Gampo in the fifteenth year of Zhenguan (641 AD). After Princess Wencheng married into Tibet, she brought a large number of Han craftsmen (wine-making, rice-milling, paper, ink, etc.), as well as silkworm seeds, which played a certain role in promoting the economic and cultural development of Tibet at that time. Therefore, the Tibetan people greatly revered Princess Wencheng, and there are statues of Princess Wencheng in the Jokhang Temple and the Potala Palace in Lhasa. In Tibetan opera, there is a traditional excellent program that praises Princess Wencheng.
    When Emperor Taizong of Tang died, Emperor Gaozong ascended the throne, and Tubo King Songtsen Gampo wrote to the Tang Dynasty's Chancellor Changsun Wuji: "When the Emperor first ascends the throne, if there are disloyal subjects, I am willing to lead troops to the country to punish them together." He also presented fifteen kinds of gold ornaments to recommend to Zhaoling (the tomb of Emperor Taizong of Tang). Emperor Gaozong of Tang conferred on Songtsen Gampo the title of "Consort Commandant and Prince of the Western Sea Commandery," and later promoted him to "Prince of Qin," and so on. This fully demonstrates the close relationship between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups at that time.
    After Princess Wencheng, there was also Princess Jincheng who married into Tibet. In the fourth year of Jinglong during the reign of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang (710 AD), Princess Jincheng was married to Tubo King Tride Tsuktsen. When Princess Jincheng went to Tibet, she brought "tens of thousands of pieces of brocade paintings," "various artisans," and also "Kucha music"; later, she requested books such as "Mao Poems," "Book of Rites," "Zuo Zhuan," and "Selections of Refined Literature." In this way, Han handicrafts, production techniques, music, and academic ideas were further spread to the Tibetan region.
    In the seventeenth year of Kaiyuan (729 AD), Tride Tsuktsen submitted a memorial to Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, stating: "Your nephew is the late emperor's uncle and a close relative, and has been favored with the marriage of Princess Jincheng, thus becoming a harmonious family, and the people of the world are all happy." This is a historically significant document. The Tubo King believed that Tubo and the Tang Dynasty were "harmonious as one family."
    The "Uncle-Nephew Alliance Stele" jointly established by Tubo King Ralpacan and Emperor Muzong of Tang in the first year of Changqing in the Tang Dynasty (821 AD) is another important historical document of the friendly relations between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups during the Tang Dynasty (called the "Changqing Alliance Stele" in Han historical materials). This "Uncle-Nephew Alliance Stele," erected more than a thousand years ago, still stands intact in front of the Jokhang Temple in the center of Lhasa.
    From the Tang Dynasty onwards, envoys from the Tibetan region to the Tang court were constantly on the road. Until the decline of Tubo, each Tsenpo reported to the Tang court upon death; when a new Tsenpo was established, he reported to the Tang court for betrothal. In addition, there were many envoys from Tubo seeking trade and contributing gifts to the Tang Dynasty.
    The Tang Dynasty was an era of great development in friendly exchanges between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups (naturally, there were also disagreements and wars between the ruling classes of the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups at that time, but they were not the historical mainstream). It laid the foundation for the union of the Tibetan people with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, primarily with the Han people; for the Tibetan people to join the big family of the motherland and jointly create a unified country with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland.
    At the end of the Tang Dynasty (mid-ninth century), internal chaos and division occurred in Tibet. A huge contradiction and struggle arose between Tubo King Langdarma and the religious upper class. Religious followers assassinated Tubo King Langdarma, causing great chaos in Tibet. In the chaos, some wanted to establish a Tsenpo, but General Lun Kongre raised troops in opposition, saying: "...Without the Tang Dynasty's investiture, how can one be called Tsenpo?" The Tubo royal family collapsed, and many royal family members and subordinates flocked to the Tang court. After that, Tibet split into countless small tribes, forming a feudal separatist situation, with mutual conquests and endless wars. The Tibetan people suffered extremely painful disasters. This chaotic situation lasted for four hundred years (mid-ninth century to early thirteenth century) because no tribe in Tibet had the strength to complete the reunification of Tibet.
    It was the power of the Yuan Dynasty that rescued the Tibetan people from the suffering of four hundred years of chaos, killing, and plunder. Yuan Emperor Möngke sent troops into Tibet in 1253 AD, ending the chaotic state of Tibet and unifying the Tibetan region. From then on, the Tibetan region was incorporated into the territory of the Great Yuan Empire, and Tibet became a part of Chinese territory.
    From the thirteenth to the eighteenth centuries, the political and religious systems of Tibet were gradually stipulated by the central government of China. The existing Tibetan "theocracy" system began in 1275. At that time, Yuan Emperor Kublai Khan, because the Sakya (Flower Sect) Dharma King Phagpa of Tibet had contributed to the creation of the Mongolian script, conferred on him the title of "Imperial Preceptor of the Great Yuan" and entrusted the Tibetan region to the rule of the Sakya Dharma King. This was the beginning of the Tibetan "theocracy" system. Emperors of successive Yuan dynasties also dispatched a "Pacification Commissioner" to reside in Tibet (similar to the Qing Dynasty's Resident Commissioner), collecting certain taxes and tributes from the Tibetan people every year. The Yuan Dynasty also established postal stations and military stations in the Tibetan region, and conducted household registration surveys and assessments of local officials, and so on.
    Because the Yuan Dynasty ended the feudal separatist situation in various parts of Tibet and unified Tibet, it brought a stable life of recuperation to the broad masses of the Tibetan people. This was what the Tibetan people longed for after experiencing four hundred years of civil war. Therefore, despite the oppression and exploitation of the Tibetan people by the Yuan Dynasty rulers, compared to the chaotic situation of the past four hundred years, it still brought great benefits to the Tibetan people and created favorable conditions for the recovery and development of Tibetan social productive forces.
    After the collapse of the Yuan Dynasty, the rule of the Sakya Dharma King dynasty in Tibet also collapsed. The Kagyu (White Sect) Dharma King Phakmo Drupa took over. However, the subordinate relationship between the Tibetan region and the motherland did not change because of the collapse of the Great Yuan Empire and the collapse of the Sakya Dharma King's rule in Tibet. In the fifth year of Hongwu during the Ming Dynasty (1372), the second Kagyu Dharma King, Gyalwang Dakpa, sent a representative to Nanjing to meet with Emperor Taizu Zhu Yuanzhang of Ming, on the one hand to congratulate the establishment of the Great Ming Empire, and on the other hand to request the Ming emperor to approve the Kagyu Dharma King's rule over Tibet. Emperor Taizu of Ming conferred on the Kagyu sect's Dharma King the titles of "Grand Situ," "Diligent Duke," and "Initiation National Teacher," and "bestowed an imperial edict to govern the three departments and thirteen thousand households of Tibet." After this, each new Dharma King, upon ascending the throne, sent a representative to Beijing to request investiture. Since Dharma King Drakpa Gyaltsen was invested by Emperor Chengzu of Ming as "Enlightenment King" and awarded a jade seal, successive Kagyu Dharma Kings were invested as "Enlightenment King," and some were also additionally invested as "Initiation National Teacher."
    During the Ming Dynasty, the friendly exchanges between the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland were even more developed. This can be proven from the records of the History of the Ming Dynasty: For example, in the seventh year of Yongle during the reign of Emperor Chengzu of Ming (1409), Emperor Chengzu sent four imperial envoys to Lhasa to welcome Master Tsongkhapa to the interior to preach. Tsongkhapa could not go, so he sent his great disciple Jangsem Sherab Gyaltsen as a representative to Beijing. Emperor Chengzu of Ming conferred on him the title of "Great Compassionate Dharma King," and Emperor Xuanzong further conferred on him the title of "National Teacher."
    During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, the eunuch Yang Ying was sent to Tibet to confer on the Karmapa of the Kagyu sect the titles of "Great Benevolent and Free Buddha of the Western Heaven," "Great Treasure Dharma King Tathagata," and "Initiation Great National Teacher." According to the statistics of the Ministry of Rites of the Ming Dynasty, in the 1550s, the number of people coming to Beijing from Tibet to offer tribute was three to four hundred each year; in the 1560s, it increased to three to four thousand each year.
    As the Ming Dynasty's rule tended towards collapse, the Kagyu Dharma King's rule in Tibet also faltered. In the sixteenth year of Chongzhen (1643 AD), the Gelug (Yellow Sect) leaders, the Fifth Dalai Lama and the Fourth Panchen Lama, borrowed the military strength of Gushi Khan, the Qinghai Mongol chieftain, and overthrew the Kagyu Dharma King's ruling position in Tibet, taking his place. From then on, the leadership group headed by the Dalai Lama ruled the Tibetan people.
    After the Qing troops entered the pass, in the ninth year of Shunzhi (1652), the Fifth Dalai Lama personally went to Beijing from Tibet to pay homage and requested investiture from the Qing Emperor. When the Fifth Dalai Lama returned to Tibet in 1653, Emperor Shunzhi of Qing conferred on the Fifth Dalai Lama the title of "All-Knowing Vajradhara, Possessor of the Doctrine, Dalai Lama." The title "Dalai Lama" was established from this time. The functions and organization of the Tibetan local government (Kashag) were also stipulated by Emperor Qianlong of Qing. He stipulated that the "Kashag" was the highest administrative organ in the Tibetan region. The "Kashag" had four "Kalons," who were the highest officials in the Tibetan local government below the Regent.
    During the Qing Dynasty, especially during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Qing, the relationship between the Tibetan ethnic group and the ethnic groups of the motherland became closer. In the fifty-sixth year of Qianlong during the Qing Dynasty (1791), the Gurkhas invaded Tibet. The Gurkhas were an ethnic group in Nepal. The ruling class of this ethnic group not only brutally ruled the various ethnic groups of their own country but also had great ambitions to invade the Tibetan region. In 1791, the Gurkha rulers, using a minor incident on the Tibetan-Nepalese border as a pretext, drove a large number of troops to invade Tibet on a large scale, advancing all the way to Shigatse. They looted the Tashilhunpo Monastery where the Panchen Lama resided, surrounded the fortress of Shigatse Dzong (where a Han military officer was inside resisting), killed people and set fires everywhere, and robbed property and livestock. The places they reached were reduced to scorched earth. West of Shigatse, the area was completely occupied, and the Tibetan people suffered unprecedented disasters. The Tibetan local government's troops were defeated by the invaders, and the entire Tibet was in danger of being occupied. The Dalai and Panchen then sent representatives to the then central government, the Qing court, for help. The Qing government accepted the request of the Dalai and Panchen and immediately organized a force of about 20,000 people, entering Tibet from Qinghai and Xikang.
    This war progressed smoothly because it was supported by the people of all strata in Tibet. In May of the fifty-seventh year of Qianlong during the Qing Dynasty (1792), the Qing government's troops expelled all the invaders occupying Rear Tibet from the Tibetan territory. The Gurkha king "confessed his guilt and begged for peace," vowing "never to dare invade the border again in the future."
    The Qing government's dispatch of troops to Tibet this time was of profound significance. It not only expelled the foreign invaders and consolidated the southwestern border of the motherland but also made the broad masses of the Tibetan people personally experience the great support given by the motherland, thus enhancing the friendship between the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland and further consolidating the relationship between Tibet and the motherland.
    In the late Qing Dynasty and the early years of the Republic of China, due to the stepped-up efforts of imperialists to instigate Tibetan reactionary elements to carry out various criminal activities against the motherland, the relationship between the Tibetan region and the motherland suffered serious damage. However, the Tibetan region has, after all, long been an inseparable part of Chinese territory; the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland have had a long-term fraternal friendship and have formed a common destiny of sharing weal and woe. This relationship can never be changed by imperialists and a small number of Tibetan reactionary elements. Although the Tibetan people opposed the Qing government's and the Northern Warlords' policies of national oppression, they always harbored a deep love for the motherland and eagerly hoped to restore normal relations with the motherland. Although the reactionary upper-class elements in Tibet colluded with foreign countries, they were precisely afraid of this pressure and had to admit that Tibet was a part of the motherland's territory and had to establish contact with the central government of the motherland to alleviate the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the Tibetan people and consolidate their ruling position in Tibet. In 1930 (the nineteenth year of the Republic of China), the Kuomintang government sent personnel to Tibet to make contact. In the same year, the Tibetan local government also sent a representative, Gongjue Zhongni, to Nanjing, establishing the Tibetan Office in Beijing. After the death of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama on December 17, 1933 (the twenty-second year of the Republic of China), the Tibetan local government, according to the customary practice of reporting to the central government after the death of successive Dalai Lamas, reported to the Kuomintang Nanjing government on January 1, 1934. The Kuomintang government also sent Huang Musong as a special envoy to Tibet in April 1934 to pay respects. Huang arrived in Lhasa in September 1934, posthumously conferring on the Thirteenth Dalai Lama the title of "Master Who Protects the Country and Promotes Culture, Universally Compassionate and Perfectly Enlightened," and established the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's Office in Tibet in Lhasa.
    In the winter of 1938, the Tibetan local government found the Dalai "reincarnate child" in Dangcai, Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province, and requested the Kuomintang central government to send senior officials to Tibet to preside over the "enthronement ceremony." In March 1939, the Kuomintang government sent Wu Zhongxin, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, to Tibet. On February 22, 1940, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama held the "enthronement ceremony" in the Potala Palace, presided over by Wu Zhongxin.
    After the death of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, Reting Hutuktu acted as the Dalai's representative. Because Reting had certain patriotic ideas, during his tenure, the relationship between the Tibetan region and the motherland improved somewhat. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Reting also led the three major monasteries in chanting sutras, praying for the victory of the motherland's war of resistance.
    In the more than ten years after this, although British and American imperialism and other foreign reactionary forces intensified their divisive activities in Tibet, attempting to erase this region from China's territory, China always maintained territorial sovereignty over the Tibetan region.
    (II) China's sovereignty over Tibet is universally recognized throughout the world, and no one can deny this fact.
    Based on the above, it can be fully proven that Tibet has never been an independent country in its long history but has always been a part of China. Even imperialists cannot deny this universally recognized fact. In 1903, Lord Hamilton, the British Secretary of State for India, stated that "(Tibet) must continue to be regarded as a province of China." On June 14, 1904, the British Foreign Secretary, in an official instruction to the British Ambassador to Russia, admitted that Tibet was "a province of the Chinese Empire." Later, in the Beijing Convention signed between China and Britain in 1906 and in the Anglo-Russian Treaty signed in 1907, although Britain used the term "China's suzerainty over Tibet" in order to conceal its aggression against Tibet, it could not openly deny that Tibet was Chinese territory. Until recently, U.S. State Department spokesman Rippe had to admit on March 24 that "the United States has never considered Tibet an independent country." A British Foreign Office spokesman reiterated on March 31 that Britain recognizes China's sovereignty over Tibet.
    As for India, after its independence, it repeatedly expressed its respect for China's sovereignty over Tibet. It was precisely on the basis of this mutual respect for territorial sovereignty that China and India signed the Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibetan Region of China and India on April 29, 1954, and established the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. After the signing of this agreement, on May 15, Indian Prime Minister Nehru criticized in a speech to the People's Assembly certain remarks that attempted to erase China's sovereignty in Tibet, saying: "In the past hundreds of years, I do not know at any time whether any outside country has ever denied China's sovereignty in Tibet."
    Indeed, it is obviously impossible for anyone to directly deny China's sovereignty over Tibet. Therefore, imperialists and certain people in India want to achieve this goal in a roundabout way. According to them, "Tibetans" and "Chinese" are different, so Tibet seems to be another "country." The absurdity of this argument lies in opposing the two concepts of "Tibetans" and "Chinese"; but everyone knows that China is a multi-ethnic country, and Chinese originally include Han, Mongol, Uygur, Hui, Zhuang and dozens of different ethnic groups, including Tibetans. There are many countries in the world today that are also composed of multiple ethnic groups. So, can it be denied that they are unified countries because one ethnic group in these countries is "different" from another?
    There are also some people who acknowledge China's sovereignty over Tibet but at the same time believe that it must be premised on Tibetan "autonomy." The logical confusion of this argument is even more astonishing! Since Tibet is a part of China, then Tibet's autonomy can only be China's internal affair. How can it become a condition and limitation on China's sovereignty over Tibet? When the Indian government mentioned Tibetan autonomy in a memorandum to the Chinese government on August 26, 1950, it also acknowledged that this was "autonomy within the scope of Chinese sovereignty." Since this is the case, it has nothing to do with China's sovereignty over Tibet. Moreover, in fact, the new Chinese government has always advocated the implementation of regional autonomy for ethnic minorities, and many ethnic minorities have established autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties in the big family of the motherland. If it were not for the sabotage and obstruction of Tibetan reactionary elements, autonomy would have been implemented in Tibet long ago. It can be seen that some people are particularly enthusiastic about Tibetan "autonomy" but just want to make a big deal out of this issue, thereby interfering in China's internal affairs and denying China's sovereignty over Tibet. This is really overestimating their capabilities!
    (III) Imperialism has been carrying out frantic aggression against the Tibetan region of our country, and the Tibetan compatriots' anti-imperialist struggle is an important component of the anti-imperialist struggle of all ethnic groups in the country.
    If China's sovereignty over Tibet has ever been damaged, it is entirely the result of imperialist aggression. However, this absolutely cannot become a reason to deny China's sovereignty over Tibet.
    Starting in the nineteenth century, imperialist countries carried out frantic aggression against the people of all ethnic groups in our country in various forms, such as military, political, economic, and cultural. Tibet was naturally difficult to escape. The imperialists' aggression against Tibet began with barbaric armed attacks, attempting to occupy Tibet in one fell swoop and turn Tibet into a colony under their direct rule.
    From 1886 to 1888, British imperialism launched the first armed aggression against Tibet. The Tibetan people showed courage and tenacity in the face of a powerful enemy. They persisted in armed struggle for nearly two years but ultimately failed due to the disparity in strength at that time, coupled with the corruption and incompetence of the then central government (Qing court), which did not actively support the Tibetan people's anti-British struggle. Consequently, Zhemonxiong was forcibly occupied by British imperialism. In 1904, British imperialism launched a second armed aggression against Tibet, and the Tibetan people also carried out heroic resistance. However, based on the same reasons as before, the Tibetan people suffered great losses in the armed struggle.
    However, due to the resolute resistance of the Tibetan people, British imperialism failed to achieve its aggressive goal of occupying Tibet in two armed aggressions. British imperialism then turned to more insidious means. They bought off a small number of national scum and reactionary elements willing to recognize thieves as their fathers within the Tibetan ruling group, cultivated them as agents of British imperialism, and attempted to disintegrate Tibet from within. Even more viciously, British imperialism instigated its lackeys to use the name of opposing the Qing government's national oppression to divert the target of the Tibetan people's struggle, shifting from anti-imperialism to opposing the Qing government and opposing the people of the motherland. From that time on, a clique emerged among the reactionary elements of the Tibetan upper-class group that was fostered by British imperialism, namely the so-called "pro-British faction." The imperialists used this group of reactionary elements to carry out the conspiracy of separating Tibet from China and throwing it into the arms of imperialism. The so-called "Tibetan independence" in modern history has always been a dirty trick of imperialism to invade China, first of all to invade Tibet.
    In 1911, the Xinhai Revolution broke out. British imperialists believed that this was a great opportunity to invade Tibet, instigated the reactionary elements in the Tibetan upper-class group to launch a large-scale rebellion, drove the Qing Dynasty's Resident Commissioner out of Tibet, and carried out bloody massacres of patriotic elements among the Tibetan religious upper class and nobles (such as Danjilin Hutuktu, Tsering Kalon, and the Abbot of Drepung Monastery, all of whom were brutally murdered). At that time, the Ninth Panchen Erdeni, who was loyal to the motherland, had to leave Tibet and flee to the interior in order to avoid persecution.
    After the imperialist conspiracy of instigating rebellion in Tibet and driving away the Qing Dynasty's Resident Commissioner was realized, their second step was to exert pressure diplomatically, forcing the then Northern Warlords government to recognize Tibet's secession from China and becoming a British colony. The Simla Conference of 1913-1914, the so-called "China-Britain-Tibet Conference," was jointly convened by British imperialism colluding with Tibetan reactionary elements to threaten the Chinese government to recognize Tibet's de facto separation from the motherland. At this conspiracy meeting, British imperialist elements even proposed a servile treaty that was equivalent to requiring the Chinese government to cede Tibet, including "When the Chinese government has disputes with Tibet, the Indian government shall adjudicate"; "British people shall be allowed to trade freely in Tibet; the Chinese government shall not impose restrictions"; and "The internal affairs of Tibet shall be temporarily supervised by the Indian government; Britain shall be allowed to send representatives to reside permanently in Lhasa," etc. It is clear that a major conspiracy of British imperialism at that time was to attempt to use its colony of India to realize the British Empire's colonial rule over the Tibetan region of our country. However, this conspiracy aroused great indignation among the people of all ethnic groups in our country, especially the Tibetan people. The Chinese representative refused to sign the treaty at the Simla Conference, and the Chinese government never recognized this treaty.
    In 1918, British imperialism took advantage of the First World War and instigated Tibetan reactionary elements to send troops into Changdu, Dege, and other places. The British Minister to China came forward to "mediate" and demanded that the "China-Britain-Tibet Conference" be held again, enticing the Chinese government to sign the treaty proposed at the Simla Conference to seize Tibetan territory. This was immediately abandoned due to the firm opposition of the people of the whole country (including the Tibetan people and patriots).
    In the following ten years, British imperialists did not stop their shameless activities of cultivating their own forces in Tibet, interfering in and undermining the normal relationship between the central government of our country and the Tibetan local government. After the death of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama in 1933, Reting Hutuktu acted as the Dalai's representative. Reting represented the patriotic will of the broad masses of Tibetan monks and lay people and worked hard to further close the relationship between the Tibetan region and the motherland. However, Reting's closeness to the motherland aroused the hatred of British imperialism and the reactionary elements of the Tibetan upper class. In order to suppress the development of patriotic forces in Tibet, the imperialists and Tibetan reactionary elements used the most despicable and brutal means against this Reting Hutuktu, whom they had always respected as a "Living Buddha." First, in 1941, they used rumors and slander to force Reting to step down, and Dazha took over; then, in 1947, they fabricated false evidence of Reting's "rebellion," arrested Reting, and murdered him. Then, the reactionary elements poisoned Qi Que Cairang, the father of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, who had close ties with Reting and was loyal to the motherland.
    The "Reting Incident" was a bloody persecution by imperialists and Tibetan reactionary elements against progressive people in Tibet who were loyal to the motherland.
    After Reting stepped down, a group of the most reactionary and craziest imperialist lackeys, headed by Dazha, Lukhangwa, Lobsang Tashi, Shakabpa, Lhalu, Shasu, and Sokhang, controlled the ruling power in Tibet within the Tibetan ruling group. Although there were also a group of more progressive and patriotic upper-class people and many middle-of-the-roaders, they could not play a role in the Tibetan local government under the control of the reactionary elements.
    Under the control of a group of the most reactionary and craziest imperialist lackeys, the Tibetan political situation took a sharp turn for the worse. They unscrupulously carried out criminal activities to betray the motherland, attempting to separate the Tibetan region from the great motherland and turn it into a colony of imperialism. In the summer of 1943 (the thirty-second year of the Republic of China), the Tibetan local government (Kashag), under the instigation of imperialism, suddenly announced the establishment of the so-called "Foreign Affairs Bureau." The British and then Nepalese representatives in Tibet immediately contacted this "Foreign Affairs Bureau." At the same time, the Tibetan local government even listed the representative of the Kuomintang government, which was the central government at that time, as a "foreign" representative office in Lhasa, along with the foreign representatives of Britain and Nepal, indicating that Tibet was another "country." Due to the firm opposition of the people of the whole country, including the Tibetan people, the then Kuomintang government ordered the resident office in Tibet to insist on not entering the "Foreign Affairs Bureau," and this conspiracy failed.
    After the failure of the above conspiracy, British imperialists and Tibetan reactionary elements played another trick. In March 1947 (the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China), Britain convened the "Pan-Asian Conference" in New Delhi, India, inviting all Asian countries to participate, and invited Tibet as a "country" to participate in the conference. The imperialists also made secret arrangements at the conference. Among the national flags of Asian countries hung at the venue, the "Snow Mountain Lion" religious flag of Tibetan Buddhism was also hung as the "national flag" of Tibet. Even more shamelessly, on the map of Asia hung at the venue, Tibet was demarcated out of China's territory, vainly attempting to create the established fact that Tibet was an "independent country." After this news spread, it aroused great anger among the people of the whole country, and the Chinese delegation also raised serious protests. The "Pan-Asian Conference" had to make corrections.
    When British imperialism was plotting the conspiracy of "Tibetan independence," it never forgot to bring up the relationship between China and India as an excuse. British imperialist elements, the British representative in Tibet, Gould, openly said: "There should be a buffer state between two great powers. China should make Tibet a buffer state so as to avoid conflicts between China and India." In fact, this so-called "buffer state" theory is entirely the ghost talk of imperialism. The people of China and India have lived in peace for many years and do not need any "buffer" at all. To go one step further, if a "buffer" is needed, why must the territory of China be unilaterally selected? Isn't this a clear expansion and aggression?
    It is very clear that events such as the murder of Reting, the establishment of the "Foreign Affairs Bureau," and the "Pan-Asian Conference" were all despicable conspiracies by British imperialism to intensify aggression against the Tibetan region of our country.
    (IV) American and British imperialism are trying to prevent the peaceful liberation of the Tibetan region of our country and prevent the rebirth of the Tibetan people. However, the progress of history shows that all the conspiracies of imperialists and foreign expansionists will be smashed, and the Tibetan people, together with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, will advance from victory to victory under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    After the victory of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan, American imperialism replaced Japanese imperialism in China and tried to turn China into a colony of the United States. Therefore, on the one hand, it aided and instructed the Kuomintang reactionaries to launch a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas; on the other hand, when the situation of the Chinese people's War of Liberation became increasingly clearly unfavorable to the Kuomintang reactionaries, it resorted to various conspiracies and tricks to prevent the complete liberation of the Chinese people. American imperialism began its conspiracy to interfere in Tibet as early as during World War II. At this time, the United States more actively intervened in the Tibetan region, jointly plotting the so-called "Tibetan independence" conspiracy with British imperialists.
    In October 1947, under the direction of imperialism, especially American imperialism, Tibetan reactionary elements organized a "Business Delegation," headed by Tsebhon Shakabpa, ostensibly to go to the United States, Britain, and other countries to investigate "business," but in reality, to go to the United States to receive secret instructions from the US government on how to realize the above conspiracy.
    The "Tibetan Business Delegation" arrived in Nanjing in early 1948. At that time, the Kuomintang government also tried to dissuade the "Tibetan Business Delegation" from going abroad. If they had to go abroad, they should take Chinese passports. The Tibetan reactionary elements complied in public but disobeyed in private, secretly colluding with U.S. Ambassador Stuart in Nanjing. Stuart instructed them to go to the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong, where the U.S. Consul signed the "passports" made by the Tibetan local government (Kashag) itself. They flew to the United States on July 19, 1948.
    After arriving in the United States, the "Tibetan Business Delegation," under the arrangement of the US government, carried out shameless activities of opposing the motherland and selling out the interests of the Tibetan people, and babbled everywhere, saying:
  "The relationship between Tibet and China is only a religious connection. China has no right to govern the Tibetan people at all. China is not worthy to ask about what passport we use to go abroad."
    Subsequent facts proved that the Tibetan reactionary elements sent the "Business Delegation" to the United States and Britain to directly discuss with their masters how to further carry out activities against the motherland. In the summer of 1949, just as the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and liberated Nanjing and Shanghai, the Kuomintang government fled to Guangzhou, and the Northwest People's Liberation Army also liberated Xi'an and was advancing towards the Great Northwest, and the whole country was about to be liberated, the so-called "Expulsion of Hans Incident" in Lhasa, Tibet, was jointly created by US and British imperialism and Tibetan reactionary elements. On July 8, 1949, the Tibetan local government (Kashag) suddenly notified the Kuomintang government's office in Lhasa to have all its personnel and their families leave Tibet immediately. The Tibetan local government also telegraphed the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Kuomintang government from Kalimpong, India, saying: "In order to prevent communists from mixing into Tibet, we specially request the complete withdrawal of all central government personnel stationed in Tibet, and have notified all relevant personnel and their families to return to the mainland within the prescribed time limit."
    The wishful thinking of the US and British imperialists and Tibetan reactionary elements was: As long as all the offices and personnel sent by the Kuomintang government stationed in Lhasa are driven out of Tibet and the connection between Tibet and the motherland is severed, the Tibetan region can be separated from the motherland, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army can be prevented from entering Tibet, and the Tibetan people can continue to be enslaved. Therefore, after the so-called "Expulsion of Hans Incident" occurred, US and British news agencies released the clamor of Tibet's separation from China. The Associated Press said: "Diplomatic authorities stated today that the Tibetan authorities are taking advantage of the Chinese government's difficulties and may completely break away from China's nominal religious sovereignty." A British news agency's telegram also said: "Britain has never recognized China's statement that Tibet is a part of China and is under Chinese jurisdiction." These telegrams fully exposed the dark dealings of British and American imperialists in instigating Tibetan reactionaries to create the so-called "Expulsion of Hans Incident" in an attempt to separate Tibet from the motherland.
    Soon after the "Expulsion of Hans Incident" occurred, the US imperialists directly sent a special agent leader, Lowell Thomas, from Washington to Lhasa in August 1949 to carry out conspiracy activities. In October 1949, Lowell Thomas returned to the United States from Tibet, and American newspapers clamored that "The United States is ready to recognize Tibet as

    西藏是我国领土不可分割的一部分
    自从西藏上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱被迅速平定以来，长期策划和支持这个叛乱阴谋的帝国主义者和外国反动势力，在极度的懊丧和仇恨之余，连篇累牍地发出对中国人民的诬蔑。他们并且大肆叫嚷“西藏不是中国的”、“西藏是一个独立的国家”等等，妄想遮掩世界公众的耳目，否认中国对西藏的主权，并在“西藏独立”的幌子下掩藏他们侵略西藏、干涉中国内政的野心。然而，谎话绝对抹煞不了事实，诬蔑也绝对经不起对证。西藏人民长期以来就与中国各族人民、特别是汉族人民结成了亲密的兄弟关系，是祖国大家庭的一个成员。西藏地方长期以来就属于中国的版图，成为中国领土的不可分割的一个组成部分。这是任何人无法否认的事实。
    （一）西藏地方长期以来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分。
    我国是一个多民族的大国，是由汉族、藏族、蒙族、维吾尔族、僮族等几十个民族经过长期合作，共同缔造成功的统一国家。西藏地方成为伟大祖国的一个组成部分，经过了长期酝酿和形成的过程；西藏民族加入中国各民族的大家庭，与汉族以及中国境内其他民族发生兄弟的关系，已有悠久的历史。西藏人民正是在与祖国各族人民、主要是汉族人民长期的友好往来、团结互助的过程中，经过同甘共苦、患难相救的考验，作出了选择和决定的。
    西藏人民与祖国各族人民，这里主要是指与汉族人民之间的友好往来，在很早以前已经开始。到七世纪时（唐朝初期）汉藏两族的友好往来，有了很大的发展，除了经济和文化交流之外，在政治上也建立了亲密的关系。如大家所熟知的，唐太宗曾在贞观十五年（公元641年）以宗女文成公主嫁给吐蕃王松赞干布。文成公主嫁到西藏以后，又去了大批汉族工匠（造酒、碾米、纸、墨等匠），还带去蚕种等等，对于当时西藏经济文化的发展起了一定的推动作用。所以西藏人民对文成公主是很崇敬的，在拉萨大昭寺、布达拉宫，都有文成公主的塑像。而在藏戏中，有一个传统的优秀节目，就是歌颂文成公主的。
    唐太宗死，高宗即位，吐蕃王松赞干布写信给唐朝宰相长孙无忌：“天子初即位，下有不忠者愿勒兵赴国共讨之”。他并献金琲十五种以荐昭陵（唐太宗的坟墓）。唐高宗封松赞干布为“驸马都尉、西海郡王”，后来又晋封为“賨王”，等等。这充分说明当时汉藏民族的密切关系。
    在文成公主之后，还有一个金城公主也嫁到西藏。唐中宗景龙四年（公元710年），以金城公主嫁给吐蕃王尺带珠丹。金城公主赴藏时，又带去“锦绘数万”、“杂伎诸工”，还有“龟兹乐”；后来又求“毛诗”、“礼记”、“左传”、“文选”等书籍。这样，汉族的手工业产品和生产技术以及音乐和学术思想，又进一步传播到了西藏地区。
    尺带珠丹在开元十七年（公元729年），上表给唐玄宗，内称：“外甥是先皇帝舅宿亲，又蒙降金城公主，遂和同为一家，天下百姓，普皆安乐”。这是有重大意义的历史文件。吐蕃王认为当时吐蕃已和唐朝“和同为一家”。
    唐朝长庆元年（公元821年）吐蕃王赤饶巴巾与唐穆宗共同建立的“甥舅联盟碑”，是唐时汉藏两民族友好关系的另一个重要历史文献（汉文史料中称为“长庆会盟碑”）。这块一千多年前建立的“甥舅联盟碑”现在还完整的屹立在拉萨市中心的大昭寺门口。
    从唐代起，西藏地方到唐廷的使者不绝于途，直到吐蕃衰亡，每代赞普死时，要向唐廷报丧；新立赞普，要向唐廷报聘。每代唐皇继位，吐蕃皆奉表祝贺。此外，吐蕃向唐求互市、贡献礼物的使臣亦很多。
    唐朝这一时代，是汉藏两大民族之间友好往来大发展的时代（自然，汉藏两大民族的统治阶级之间，那时也有过失和，有过战争，但不是历史主流）。它为西藏人民与祖国各族人民、首先是与汉族人民的联合；为西藏人民参加祖国大家庭、与祖国各族人民共同缔造统一的国家奠定了基础。
    唐朝末年（九世纪中叶），西藏内部发生了混乱和分裂。吐蕃王朗达马与宗教上层之间发生了巨大的矛盾和斗争，宗教徒刺杀了吐蕃王朗达马，全藏大乱。在纷乱中，有人要立赞普，大将论恐热起兵反对，并说：“……无大唐册封，何名赞普？”吐蕃王室崩溃，许多王室臣属纷纷投向唐廷。这以后西藏分裂为无数的小部落，形成封建割据局面，互相征伐，战争连绵不绝，西藏人民遭受到非常痛苦的灾难。这种混乱局面一直持续了四百年（九世纪中叶至十三世纪初），因为西藏任何一个部落的力量都完成不了重新统一西藏的任务。
    把西藏人民从四百年的混乱、残杀、掠夺的苦难中拯救出来的，是元朝的力量。元宪宗蒙哥于公元1253年派遣军队进入西藏，才结束了西藏的混乱状态，统一了西藏地方。从此，西藏地方便归入大元帝国的版图之内，西藏成为中国领土的一部分。
    由十三世纪至十八世纪的几百年间，西藏的政治制度和宗教制度都是由中国的中央政府陆续规定的。现存的西藏“政教合一”的制度，始于1275年。当时元世祖忽必烈因为西藏萨迦派（花教）法王八思巴创造蒙文有功，封为“大元帝师”，并把西藏地方交给萨迦法王统治，这就是西藏“政教合一”制度的开端。历代元朝皇帝同时派有一个“宣慰使”驻在西藏（类似清代的驻藏大臣），每年向西藏人民征收一定的赋税和贡物。元朝还在西藏地方设置了驿站、军站，并进行了调查户口和对地方官吏的考核等等。
    由于元朝结束了西藏各地的封建割据局面，统一了西藏，因而给西藏广大人民带来了休养生息的安定生活。这是经历了四百年的混战以后，西藏人民所渴望的。因此尽管元朝统治者对西藏人民存在着压迫和剥削；但是这和过去四百年的混战局面比较起来，仍然给西藏人民带来了很大的利益，给西藏社会生产力的恢复和发展创造了有利的条件。
    元朝统治崩溃以后，西藏萨迦法王王朝在西藏的统治也随之垮台，噶举派（白教）法王帕莫主巴取而代之。但是西藏地方与祖国的隶属关系，并未因为大元帝国的崩溃和萨迦法王在西藏的统治垮台而有所改变。噶举派第二代法王甲样于明洪武五年（1372）派代表去南京，见了明太祖朱元璋，一方面为大明帝国的建立祝贺，一方面请求明朝皇帝批准噶举法王统治西藏。明太祖封噶举派法王为“大司徒”、“勤国公”、“灌顶国师”，并“赐统御西藏三部十三万之敕诏”。此后，每代新法王即位，都派代表去北京请封，自从札巴坚赞法王受明成祖之封为“阐化王”、赏给玉印以后，历代噶举派法王均封“阐化王”，有的也加封“灌顶国师”。
    在明朝时代，西藏人民与祖国各族人民之间的友好往来是更加发展了。这可以从明史记载得到证明：如明成祖永乐七年（1409），成祖派钦差四人，到拉萨去迎宗喀巴大师来内地讲经。宗喀巴不能去，派他的大弟子降青曲结为代表，前往北京，明成祖封他为“大慈法王”，宣明宗又加封为“国师”。
    明万历年间，又派太监杨英去西藏，封噶举派的噶马巴为“西天大善自在佛”、“如来大宝法王”、“灌顶大国师”。根据明朝礼部的统计，在十五世纪五十年代，西藏来京进贡的人数每年有三、四百人；到六十年代，每年多至三、四千人。
    在明朝统治趋于崩溃的时候，西藏噶举派法王在西藏的统治也同时发生动摇，崇祯十六年（公元1643年），西藏格鲁派（黄教）领袖五世达赖和四世班禅借青海蒙古酋长固始汗的兵力，推翻了噶举派法王在西藏的统治地位，取而代之。从那时起，以达赖喇嘛为首的领导集团就统治了西藏人民。
    清兵入关以后，顺治九年（1652年），五世达赖喇嘛亲由西藏到北京朝贺，并请清朝皇
  帝加封。1653年五世达赖返藏时，清顺治皇帝封五世达赖为“西天大善自在佛所领天下释教普通凡赤坦达赖喇嘛”。“达赖喇嘛”的封号就是从这时规定下来的。西藏地方政府（噶厦）的职能和组织，也是清乾隆皇帝规定的。他规定“噶厦”为西藏地方的最高行政机关，“噶厦”内设四个“噶伦”，是西藏地方政府中摄政以下最大的官员。
    清朝时候、特别是清高宗乾隆年间，西藏民族与祖国各民族之间的关系更加密切。清乾隆五十六年（1791年），廓尔喀人侵入西藏。廓尔喀是尼泊尔国的一个民族，这个民族的统治阶级不仅残暴地统治他本国的各族人民，而且对西藏地方抱有很大的侵略野心。1791年廓尔喀的统治者借口藏尼边境小事，驱使大量军队大举侵入西藏，一直攻到日喀则。他们抢掠了班禅住的札什伦布寺，包围了日喀则宗的堡垒（有一汉军都司在内拒守），到处杀人放火，抢劫财物牲畜，所到之处成了一片焦土。日喀则以西，一时完全沦陷，西藏人民遭到了空前的灾难，西藏地方政府的部队被侵略者所击败，整个西藏有被侵占的危险。达赖、班禅于是派代表向当时的中央政府、即清廷求救，清朝政府接受了达赖、班禅的请求，立即组织了一支大约两万余人的部队，由青海、西康两路进入西藏。
    这次战争因为得到西藏各阶层人民的拥护和支持，进展很顺利。清乾隆五十七年（1792年）5月，清朝政府军队就将占领后藏的侵略者全部逐出西藏境外。廓尔喀国王“认罪乞和”，立誓“以后永远不敢侵犯边界”。
    清朝政府这次派军队入藏意义深远。它不仅驱逐了外国侵略者，巩固了祖国的西南边疆；而且使西藏广大人民亲身体验到祖国给予的巨大支援，因而增进了西藏人民与祖国各族人民之间的情谊，进一步巩固了西藏与祖国的关系。
    清朝末年和民国成立初期，由于帝国主义加紧策动西藏反动分子进行种种反对祖国的罪恶活动，曾使得西藏地方与祖国的关系蒙受严重损害。然而，西藏地方毕竟长期以来就是中国领土不可分割的组成部分；西藏人民与祖国各族人民，已有了长期的兄弟友谊，并且结成了同甘共苦的共同命运。这种关系决不是帝国主义及西藏少数反动分子所能改变得了的。西藏人民虽然反对清政府和北洋军阀的民族压迫政策，但对于祖国是始终满怀热爱，并且殷切盼望与祖国恢复正常关系的。西藏反动上层分子虽然里通外国，也正是慑于这种压力，而不能不承认西藏是祖国领土的一部分，不能不与祖国的中央政权建立联系；以缓和西藏广大人民的不满情绪，和巩固自己在西藏的统治地位，1930年（民国十九年），国民党政府派员到西藏去进行联络，同年西藏地方政府也派代表贡觉仲尼赴南京，成立了西藏驻京办事处。1933年（民国二十二年）12月17日，十三世达赖逝世以后，西藏地方政府根据历代达赖逝世后向中央政府报告的惯例，于1934年1月1日向国民党南京政府作了报告。国民党政府也于1934年4月派黄慕松为专使赴西藏致祭。黄于1934年9月抵达拉萨，追封十三世达赖为“护国弘化普慈圆觉大师”，并在拉萨设立了蒙藏委员会驻藏办事处。
    1938年冬，西藏地方政府在青海省湟中县当采地方，找到了达赖“灵童”，请求国民党中央政府派大员入藏主持“坐床典礼”。1939年3月，国民党政府派蒙藏委员会委员长吴忠信入藏。1940年2月22日，十四世达赖在吴忠信主持下，在布达拉宫举行了“坐床典礼”。
    十三世达赖喇嘛逝世以后，热振呼图克图代行达赖职务。由于热振具有一定的爱国主义思想，在他执政期间，西藏地方与祖国的关系有了若干增进。抗日战争初期，热振还曾领导三大寺念经，祈祷祖国抗战胜利。
    在这以后的十多年间，英、美帝国主义以及其他外国反动势力，虽曾在西藏变本加厉地策划分裂活动，企图从中国的版图上抹去这块地方；但是中国始终保持着对西藏地方的领土主权。
    （二）中国对西藏的主权是全世界所公认的，没有任何人能够否认这个事实。
    根据以上所述完全可以证明，西藏在长期的历史中，从来不是独立国家，而是中国的一部分。对于这个全世界所公认的事实，甚至帝国主义者也无法加以否认。1903年，英国印度事务大臣汉密尔顿曾经声称，“（西藏）必须继续被认为是中国的一个省”。1904年6月14日，英国外交大臣在致英驻俄大使的正式训令中承认，西藏为“中华帝国的一省”。后来，在1906年中英签订的北京协定中，在1907年签订的英俄条约中，虽然英国使用了“中国对西藏的宗主权”这种字样，以便于掩饰它对西藏的侵略，但也毕竟无法明目张胆地否认西藏是中国的领土。直到最近，美国国务院发言人里普在3月24日也不得不承认，“美国从来不认为西藏是一个独立国家”。英国外交部发言人则在3月31日重申，英国承认中国对西藏的主权。
    至于印度，在它独立以后，曾经一再表示尊重中国对西藏的主权。正是在这种互相尊重领土主权的基础之上，中国和印度在1954年4月29日签订了关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定，并确定了著名的和平共处五项原则。在这个协定签字之后，5月15日，印度尼赫鲁总理曾经在人民院的演说中指责了某些企图抹煞中国在西藏的主权的言论，他说：“在已往数百年当中，我就不知道在任何时候，任何一个外面的国家曾经否认过中国在西藏的主权。”
    的确，不论任何人，要想直接否认中国对西藏的主权，显然是不可能的。于是，帝国主义者和印度的某些人士就想转弯抹角地来达到这个目的。据他们说，“西藏人”和“中国人”是不同的，因此西藏似乎是另外一个“国家”。这种论调的荒唐就在于把“西藏人”和“中国人”这两个概念对立起来；可是谁都知道，中国是一个多民族的国家，中国人本来就包括汉人、蒙人、维吾尔人、回人、僮人等几十个不同民族的人民，其中也包括藏人。现在世界上有不少国家也是由多民族组成的，那么，难道能够以这些国家的某个民族和另一个民族“不同”而否认它们是统一的国家吗？
    还有一种人，他们承认中国对西藏的主权，但同时又认为必须以西藏“自治”为前提。这种论调的逻辑混乱尤为惊人！西藏既然是中国的一部分，那么西藏的自治，只能是中国的内政，它怎么能够成为中国对西藏的主权的条件和限制呢？1950年8月26日，印度政府致中国政府的备忘录在提到西藏自治的时候也承认，这是“在中国主权范围之内的自治”。既然如此，它就同中国对西藏的主权问题风马牛不相及。何况，事实上，新中国政府一向是主张实行少数民族地方自治的，许多少数民族都已在祖国的大家庭中建立了自治区、自治州、自治县。如果不是由于西藏反动分子的破坏和阻挠，在西藏也早已实行了自治。由此可见，有人对西藏“自治”特别热心，不过是想在这个问题上大做文章，从而干涉中国内政，并否认中国对西藏的主权。这真是太不自量力了！
    （三）帝国主义对我国西藏地方一直进行疯狂侵略，西藏同胞的反帝斗争是全国各族人民反帝斗争的一个重要组成部分。
    如果说中国对西藏的主权曾经遭受损害，那完全是帝国主义侵略的结果。但是，这绝对不能成为否认中国对西藏主权的理由。
    从十九世纪开始，帝国主义国家对我国各族人民进行了军事、政治、经济、文化等各种形式的疯狂侵略，西藏自然也难于幸免。帝国主义者侵略我国西藏开始时采取了野蛮的武装进攻，企图一举占领西藏，把西藏变成他们直接统治下的殖民地。
    1886—1888年，英帝国主义者第一次向西藏发动武装侵略，西藏人民在强大的敌人面前表现出勇敢和顽强。他们坚持进行了将近两年的武装斗争，但终由于当时力量对比悬殊，再加上当时的中央政府（清廷）腐败无能，没有积极地支持西藏人民的反英斗争，因而遭到失败，被英帝国主义者强占去了哲孟雄。英帝国主义者在1904年，又向西藏发动了第二次武装侵略，西藏人民同样进行了英勇的抵抗。但基于与前一次相同的原因，西藏人民在武装斗争中遭到很大损失。
    然而，由于西藏人民的坚决抵抗，英帝国主义者两次武装侵略西藏，都未能达到他们占领西藏的侵略目的。英帝国主义者于是转而采用更加阴险的手段，他们在西藏统治集团里面收买了一小撮民族败类和甘愿认贼作父的反动分子，把他们培养成为英帝国主义的代理人，企图从西藏内部进行瓦解。更恶毒的是英帝国主义者唆使他们的走狗以反对清朝政府的民族压迫为名，转移西藏人民的斗争目标，由反帝转为反对清朝政府和反对祖国人民。从那时起，西藏上层集团的反动分子中就出现了由英帝国主义一手扶植起来的班底，即所谓“亲英派”。帝国主义者就利用了这一批反动分子进行使西藏脱离中国，而投入帝国主义怀抱的阴谋活动。近代史上的所谓“西藏独立”，从来就是帝国主义侵略中国，首先是侵略西藏的肮脏的把戏。
    1911年辛亥革命爆发，英帝国主义者认为这是侵略西藏的大好机会，唆使西藏上层集团中的反动分子举行大规模的叛乱，把清朝的驻藏大臣赶出了西藏，对西藏宗教上层和贵族中的爱国分子进行了血腥屠杀（如丹吉林胡图克图、擦绒噶伦、哲蚌寺大比布元典喇嘛等人，都惨遭杀害）。当时忠于祖国的九世班禅额尔德尼，为了避免迫害不得不离开西藏逃到内地。
    帝国主义在西藏策动叛乱、赶走清朝驻藏大臣的阴谋实现以后，他们第二步就在外交上施加压力，强要当时的北洋军阀政府承认西藏脱离中国，变成英国殖民地。1913—1914年的西姆拉会议，即所谓“中英藏会议”，就是英帝国主义勾结西藏反动分子一起召开的，目的是威胁中国政府承认西藏在事实上脱离祖国。英国帝国主义分子在这个阴谋会议上竟提出了等于要中国政府割让西藏的奴役性条约，内容包括“中国政府与西藏有争议时，由印度政府判决之”；“英国人得在西藏自由经商；中国政府不得加以限制”及“西藏内政暂由印度政府监督；英国得派代表常驻拉萨”等等。很明显，英帝国主义当时的一个重大阴谋就是企图利用它的殖民地印度来实现大英帝国对我国西藏地方的殖民统治。但是，这个阴谋引起了我国各族人民，首先是西藏人民的极大愤慨。中国代表在西姆拉会议的条约上拒绝签字，中国政府始终没有承认这一条约。
    1918年，英帝国主义又利用第一次世界大战的机会，唆使西藏反动分子派兵进入昌都、德格等地，英国驻华公使出面“调停”，并要求再次举行“中英藏会议”；引诱中国政府在西姆拉会议所提出的侵占西藏领土的条约上签字，当即因为遭到全国人民（包括西藏人民和爱国人士在内）的坚决反对而作罢。
    以后的十余年间，英帝国主义者没有停止过在西藏培植自己的势力、干涉和破坏我国中央政府和西藏地方政府之间正常关系的无耻活动。1933年十三世达赖逝世以后，由热振呼图克图代行达赖职务。热振代表了西藏广大僧俗人民的爱国意志，努力使西藏地方和祖国的关系进一步密切起来。但是，热振和祖国的接近，引起了英帝国主义和西藏上层反动分子的仇视。为了镇压西藏爱国势力的发展，帝国主义和西藏反动分子对这位他们一贯尊为“活佛”的热振呼图克图，也采用了最卑鄙、最残暴的手段，先在1941年用造谣诽谤的办法，压迫热振下台，由大扎代理；然后又在1947年制造了一个热振“谋反”的假证据，逮捕了热振，加以杀害。接着反动分子又毒死了与热振关系密切，心向祖国的十四世达赖的父亲祁却才让。
    “热振事件”是帝国主义和西藏反动分子对西藏心向祖国的进步人士的一次血腥迫害。
    热振下台以后，西藏统治集团里面以大札、鲁康娃、罗桑札西、夏格巴、拉鲁、夏苏、索康等为首的一群最反动最疯狂的帝国主义走狗掌握了西藏的统治权。虽然也还有一批比较进步、心向祖国的上层人士和不少中间分子，他们在反动分子的操纵下，在西藏地方政府里面不能发挥作用。
    在一批最反动最疯狂的帝国主义走狗的操纵下，西藏政治形势急转直下，他们肆无忌惮地进行背叛祖国的罪恶活动，企图把西藏地方从伟大祖国分裂出去，变成帝国主义的殖民地。1943年（民国三十二年）夏，西藏地方政府（噶厦）在帝国主义的唆使下突然宣布成立了所谓“外交局”，英国和当时尼泊尔驻西藏代表立即和这个“外交局”发生联系，同时西藏地方政府竟把其时作为中央政府的国民党政府的代表也同英、尼等国的外国代表一样列为驻拉萨的“外国”代表机关，表示西藏是另一个“国家”。由于遭到包括西藏人民在内的全国人民的坚决反对，当时的国民党政府命令驻藏办事处坚持不进“外交局”，这一阴谋未能得逞。
    英帝国主义者和西藏的反动分子在上述阴谋失败以后，又玩弄了另一诡计。1947年（民国三十六年）3月，英国在印度新德里召开“泛亚洲会议”，邀请亚洲所有国家参加，把西藏也作为一个“国家”邀请参加了会议。帝国主义者在会上又作了阴谋布置，在会场上悬挂的亚洲各国国旗当中，把西藏佛教的“雪山狮子”宗教旗帜也当作西藏“国旗”悬挂在里面。更无耻的是在会场上悬挂的亚洲地图上，竟把西藏划出中国的版图，妄想借此造成西藏是“独立国”的既成事实。这一消息传出后，引起全国人民巨大愤怒，中国代表团也提了严重的抗议，“泛亚洲会议”不得不加以改正。
    英帝国主义在策划“西藏独立”的阴谋时，总是没有忘记搬出中国和印度的关系来作为借口。英国帝国主义分子、驻西藏代表古德曾公开说过：“两个大国之间，是应当有个缓冲国的，中国应当使西藏成为缓冲国，这样可避免中、印两国间的冲突。”其实，这种所谓“缓冲国”的论调，完全是帝国主义的鬼话，中、印两国人民多少年来和平相处，根本不需要什么“缓冲”。退一步说，既要“缓冲”，又为什么一定要片面地选择中国的领土呢？这不是明明白白的扩张和侵略吗？
    十分清楚，热振被害、成立“外交局”和“泛亚洲会议”等事件，都是英帝国主义对我国西藏地方加紧进行侵略的卑劣阴谋。
    （四）美英帝国主义力图阻挠我国西藏地方的和平解放，阻挠西藏人民的新生。但是，历史的进展表明，帝国主义和外国扩张主义者的一切阴谋都将被粉碎，西藏人民和祖国各族人民一道将在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下从胜利走向胜利。
    在中国人民抗日战争胜利以后，美帝国主义代替了日本帝国主义在中国的地位，力图使中国变为美国的殖民地。因此它一方面援助和指使国民党反动派向解放区发动全面进攻；而另一方面当中国人民解放战争的形势日益明显地不利于国民党反动派的时候，它就施出各种阴谋诡计，力图阻挠中国人民的彻底解放。美帝国主义早在第二次世界大战期间就开始了染指西藏的阴谋活动。而在这个时候，美国就更积极地插足西藏地方，与英帝国主义者共同策划所谓“西藏独立”的阴谋。
    1947年10月，在帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的指使下，西藏的反动分子组织了一个“商务代表团”，以仔本·夏格巴为团长，以赴美英各国考察“商务”为名，到美国去接受美国政府对实现上述阴谋的机密指示。
    “西藏商务代表团”于1948年初到达南京。当时国民党政府也曾经劝阻“西藏商务代表团”不要出国，如一定要出国，应拿中国护照。西藏反动分子阳奉阴违，却在南京和美大使司徒雷登秘密勾结。司徒雷登指使他们去香港美领事馆，由美领事在西藏地方政府（噶厦）自己所制造的“护照”上签字，于1948年7月19日飞抵美国。
    “西藏商务代表团”到达美国以后，在美国政府布置下进行了反对祖国出卖西藏民族利益的无耻勾当，并到处胡言乱语，说什么：
  “西藏与中国的关系，仅只是宗教上的联系，中国根本无权管辖西藏人民，我们用什么护照出国，中国根本就不配过问”。
    以后的事实证明，西藏反动分子派遣“商务代表团”到美国和英国去，乃是直接和他们的主子去讨论如何进一步进行反对祖国的活动。1949年夏，正当解放大军渡江解放了南京、上海，国民党政府逃往广州，西北人民解放军也解放了西安，正向大西北挺进，全国快要解放的时候，西藏拉萨发生的所谓“驱汉事件”，就是美英帝国主义和西藏反动分子共同制造出来的。1949年7月8日，西藏地方政府（噶厦）突然通知国民党政府驻拉萨办事处，要他们全体人员及眷属立即离开西藏。西藏地方政府并由印度噶伦堡电告国民党政府蒙藏委员会，电文说：“为欲防止共产党混迹西藏，特请求中央驻藏人员全体撤退，并已通知各该人员及其眷属在规定期限内，返回内地”。
    美英帝国主义者和西藏反动分子的如意算盘是：只要把国民党政府派驻拉萨的办事机关和人员全部赶出西藏，断绝西藏与祖国的联系，这样就可以把西藏地方从祖国分裂出去，就可以阻止中国人民解放军进驻西藏，就可以继续奴役西藏人民。所以在所谓“驱汉事件”发生以后，美英通讯社就放出了西藏脱离中国的叫嚣。合众社说：“外交当局今日表示西藏当局利用中国政府之困难，可能完全脱离中国名义上的宗教主权”。英国通讯社的电讯也说：“英国从来未承认中国所说的西藏是中国的一部分，并受中国管辖的讲法”。这些电讯充分暴露了英美帝国主义者策动西藏反动派制造所谓“驱汉事件”，企图把西藏从祖国分裂出去的阴暗勾当。
    “驱汉事件”发生以后不久，美帝国主义者直接派了一个特务头子劳尔·汤姆斯于1949年8月从华盛顿跑到拉萨，去进行阴谋活动。1949年10月劳尔·汤姆斯由西藏回到美国，美国报纸就叫嚣，“美国已准备承认西藏为独立国家，并支持它加入联合国组织的请求”，还要给予西藏地方政府以“军事援助”。
    汤姆斯回到美国以后，还发表了“这个世界以外”一书，向全世界暴露了美帝国主义者策动西藏反动派反对祖国、破坏汉藏民族团结的罪恶活动。汤姆斯自己承认他曾向噶厦（西藏地方政府）授意，要噶厦坚决反对中国人民解放军进驻西藏，他说只要西藏组织“一支有技术的游击部队，就可以阻止人民解放军进驻西藏。”
    所谓“驱汉事件”的发生，激起了全国人民包括西藏的爱国人民在内的极大愤慨。新华社奉命于1949年9月2日发表社论，指出1949年7月8日“西藏地方当权者驱逐汉族人民及国民党驻藏人员的事件，是在英美帝国主义策划下发动的。英美反动派勾结西藏地方反动当局，举行这个“反共”事件的目的，“就是企图在人民解放军即将解放全国的时候，使西藏人民不但不能得到解放，而且进一步丧失独立自由，变为外国帝国主义的殖民地奴隶”。
    1949年底，全国除了西藏和台湾之外，完全获得解放，中央人民政府于1949年10月1日在北京宣布成立。为了彻底完成解放中国大陆的伟大事业，中国人民解放军决定进驻西藏，把西藏人民从帝国主义和反动分子的奴役和压迫下解放出来。1950年，人民解放军就开始了进驻西藏的准备工作，人民解放军的前哨部队到了金沙江以东的甘孜地区。此时美英帝国主义者和西藏地方政府中的反动分子更加着慌，1950年1月，美国合众社传出了西藏当局将派出一个“亲善使团”分赴美、英、印度、尼泊尔和北京，表明其“独立”的消息。美英帝国主义者企图为他们公开干涉中国内政制造借口，以达到阻挠人民解放军进驻西藏的目的。
    新华社于1950年1月20日发表了我国外交部发言人的谈话，对上述阴谋痛加驳斥，发言人说：“西藏是中华人民共和国的领土，这是全世界没有人不知道，也从没有人否认的事实。既然如此，拉萨当局当然没有权利擅自派出任何‘使团’，更没有权利去表明他的所谓‘独立’。西藏的独立要向美国、英国、印度、尼泊尔的政府去宣传，并由美国的合众社加以宣布，使人们不难看出这种消息的内容，即令不是出于合众社的制造，也不过是美帝国主义及其侵略西藏的同谋们所导演的傀儡剧。”
    中央人民政府为了促成西藏地方政府（噶厦）与中央人民政府之间早日举行谈判，达成和平解放西藏的协议，于1950年7月，派遣西康省人民政府副主席格达活佛（藏族爱国人士）前往西藏，进行劝说工作，借以消除西藏地方政府（噶厦）对中央人民政府的一切误解，促使谈判早日举行。但格达活佛于7月24日刚一到达昌都，就遭到了英国特务福特阴谋布置下的重重阻挠，不得前往拉萨。福特并于8月21日给格达活佛下了毒药。格达中毒后，于次日（8月22日）死亡，死后全身发黑，皮肤触手即行脱落。福特为了消灭犯罪证据，将格达尸体焚毁，并将他的随行人员，押送拉萨。（我解放西藏以后，这个罪大恶极的英国帝国主义分子已被捕获）。
    中央人民政府鉴于美英帝国主义在西藏活动如此猖獗，为了早日澄清西藏局势，驱逐帝国主义势力出西藏，乃命令人民解放军进驻西藏。美英帝国主义又策动西藏地方政府（噶厦）中的反动分子指挥藏军在昌都进行抵抗阻挠，不让人民解放军向西藏进军。对这种狂妄的罪行，不能不予以惩处。人民解放军乃在昌都地区给了抵抗的藏军以歼灭性的打击，1950年10月19日歼灭了藏军主力五千余人，解放了昌都，给予英美帝国主义和西藏的少数反动分子阻挠人民解放军进驻西藏、解放西藏人民的阴谋罪行以惨重的打击。
    昌都解放以后，英美帝国主义者接连发出了疯狂的叫嚣。1949年11月1日，美国国务卿艾奇逊在华盛顿记者招待会上，公开污蔑中国人民解放自己领土西藏的行动是“侵略”，并说：“美国认为这是一件最不幸最严重的事件。”11月15日，美国国务院的喉舌“纽约时报”发表社论，敦促联合国“干预西藏问题”。英国“泰晤士报”于1950年10月31日在题为“西藏”的社论中，竟无耻地说：“中国对西藏的主权，不能从历史上找到理由”，并挑唆印度和巴基斯坦政府，向中国提出“抗议”。
    在西藏统治集团内部，以大札摄政为首的一小撮反动分子勾结帝国主义和外国扩张势力，挟持十四世达赖喇嘛逃到亚东，企图把达赖带往外国，以便等待“第三次世界大战”卷土重来。反动分子挟持达赖逃亡印度的行动，不仅激起西藏广大人民的反对，也引起了西藏三大寺的反对；而在达赖左右的堪布和噶伦里面，也有不少人不赞成达赖逃亡印度，主张与中央人民政府谈判。斗争的最后结果，是代表西藏广大人民愿望、反对达赖逃亡的爱国进步势力获得胜利。因此，1951年春，大札下台，由十四世达赖“亲政”（按照西藏旧例，达赖十八岁已达亲政年龄）。达赖亲政以后，于1951年2月委派噶伦阿沛·阿旺晋美等五人为西藏地方政府的全权代表，前来北京举行谈判。至此，美英帝国主义者阻挠西藏与祖国直接进行谈判的阴谋，完全宣告破产。
    西藏代表团到达北京以后，就和中央人民政府指定的代表举行了和平解放西藏的谈判，在党中央和毛主席的直接领导下，谈判进展非常顺利，在短短一个月的时间内，所有重要问题，都获致协议。1951年5月23日，在北京勤政殿举行了隆重的“中央人民政府与西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”的签字仪式。“和平协议”使西藏与祖国的关系问题以及西藏民族内部达赖和班禅之间，三十年久悬未决的不团结问题，都得到了正确的解决。这项协议，是中国共产党和毛主席解决国内极其复杂的民族问题的光辉的成就。
    和平解放西藏的协议签订以后，十四世达喇赖嘛于1951年8月17日自亚东回到拉萨。10月26日人民解放军驻藏部队也到达了拉萨，受到西藏僧俗人民的热烈欢迎。至此，西藏人民摆脱了帝国主义势力的羁缚，回到了祖国大家庭的怀抱，与祖国各兄弟民族的人民团结在一起，共同建设伟大祖国。英美帝国主义者曾千方百计阻挠西藏代表团前往北京，唆使西藏的反动分子抵抗人民解放军进驻西藏，企图挟持达赖逃亡……，所有这一切，都是枉费心机，以可耻的失败而告终。西藏和平解放，这是中国人民（包括西藏人民在内）的一次伟大胜利，也是帝国主义侵略势力的一次重大失败。
    十七条协议签订以后，西藏实现了和平解放，党和人民政府采取了一系列的措施，大力帮助西藏人民进行政治、经济、文化建设：修通了西藏全境主要地区之间的公路；在各地开办公费医院，为西藏人民免费治病；设立学校，让西藏人民的子弟入学；开办工厂、农场和牧场，发展西藏的工业、农业和畜牧业；举办低利贷款，扶助西藏贫苦人民发展生产；设立国营商业机构，高价收购西藏土特产，廉价供应西藏人民的日用必需品，如茶、布匹、绸缎、糖、烟等等，提高西藏人民的生活水平。1956年又成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，为西藏人民实行区域自治进行准备工作。……所有这些措施，都得到了西藏广大人民的热烈拥护，西藏地区的落后面貌正在改变。关于西藏的社会改革问题，十七条协议中也作了规定：为了西藏民族的发展、繁荣和进步，西藏的封建农奴制度是必须改革的，但这也要西藏的领袖人物和人民群众协商决定，中央不予强迫。
    但是西藏回到祖国大家庭的怀抱，是帝国主义和西藏上层反动集团所不甘心的，他们早就阴谋撕毁“和平协议”，准备武装叛乱，他们念念不忘的是：要把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去，使之沦为帝国主义的殖民地。而印度的扩张主义分子继承了英帝国主义侵略西藏的不光采遗产，怂恿西藏反动集团进行背叛祖国的罪恶活动，因此几年来，中央人民政府对协议规定由中央作的，都无折无扣的那样作了，而且不断给予西藏地方政府（噶厦）以极大的宽容和等待；而西藏地方政府（噶厦）对十七条协议规定它应该履行和遵守的部分，不但不予遵守和履行，而且自持有帝国主义作他们的靠山，印度扩张主义分子同情和支持他们，蒋介石匪帮空投接济军火因而更加嚣张起来，终于在今年的3月10日，在拉萨发动了全面叛乱，他们认为：“现在是驱汉自立的大好时机”、“汉人是可以吓跑的”。可是帝国主义分子、印度扩张主义者和西藏反动势力把形势完全估计错了。同他们的愿望相反，他们在西藏发动的叛乱不是造成祖国的分裂和西藏的倒退，而是促进了祖国的统一和巩固，促进了西藏反动势力的灭亡，促进了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。
    这次西藏反动分子的叛乱，是帝国主义和外国扩张主义者妄图侵略西藏地方而策划的又一次阴谋。发动叛乱的头子仍然是早就被祖国人民和西藏人民唾弃的，逃亡在国外的如鲁康娃等叛国分子；指挥叛乱的中心则设在噶伦堡。这一批叛国分子勾结了帝国主义、蒋介石卖国集团和印度扩张势力，孤注一掷，发动了对祖国的武装暴乱。但是，由于西藏人民坚定地与祖国各族人民站在一起，坚决拥护中央人民政府，因此中国人民解放军得以迅速平定叛乱。历史的进程表明，帝国主义和外国扩张势力的一切阴谋都将被粉碎，藏族人民和祖国各族人民一道，将在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，迈开大步勇猛前进，迅速由一个农奴制的落后民族转变成为社会主义的先进民族。
