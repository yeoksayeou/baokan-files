The First Session of the Third CPPCC Successfully Concludes

Zhou Enlai elected Chairman of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

Peng Zhen, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Li Weihan, Li Siguang, Chen Shutong, Chen Jiageng, Bao Erhan, Chen Yi, Kang Sheng, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme elected as Vice-Chairmen

The Panchen Lama solemnly declared at the meeting that the Tibet issue can only be resolved in China and sternly pointed out that the warning to interferers is entirely justified.

Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: The First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference concluded this morning. The political resolution adopted at the meeting called on all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic figures across the country to further strengthen unity and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, resolutely implement the resolutions of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan, and continue to advance towards building our country into a great, prosperous, and strong socialist nation.

The meeting announced the election results of the leading personnel of the Third National Committee:

Zhou Enlai was elected Chairman of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference;

Peng Zhen, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Li Weihan, Li Siguang, Chen Shutong, Chen Jiageng, Bao Erhan, Chen Yi, Kang Sheng, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme were elected Vice-Chairmen;

Xu Bing was elected Secretary-General;

Wang Congwu and 143 others were elected Standing Committee members.

All the members celebrated the election of the leading personnel of the Third National Committee with continuous and enthusiastic applause.

Before announcing the election results, all the members welcomed Panchen Erdeni with thunderous applause to speak at the meeting.

Panchen Erdeni's speech addressed the issue of Indian Prime Minister Nehru saying that his speech at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress was "unjust." He solemnly pointed out, "When our domestic affairs are subjected to arrogant foreign interference, I stand on the position of safeguarding the unity of the motherland, safeguarding national unity, and safeguarding Sino-Indian friendship, and express a righteous and stern warning. This is not only completely just but also entirely necessary."

When talking about Prime Minister Nehru's expression of welcoming him to India to meet the Dalai Lama, Panchen Erdeni solemnly declared: "The Tibet issue can only be resolved in Tibet, in China, and can never be resolved in any foreign country."

Panchen Erdeni's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience. (The full text of Panchen Erdeni's speech will be published separately.)

The meeting adopted the political resolution. The resolution stated: All members unanimously and warmly support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1959, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 national final accounts and the 1959 national budget draft at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress. The meeting firmly believes that as long as the people of the whole country continue to exert their efforts, improve technology, practice increasing production and practicing economy, and strive to overcome difficulties, the grand national economic plan for 1959 will surely be completed.

The resolution stated that the meeting unanimously agreed with the resolution on the Tibet issue passed by the First Session of the Second National People's Congress. The original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, colluding with imperialists and foreign interferers, tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and launched an armed rebellion betraying the motherland, undermining national unity, and harming the Tibetan people. This is absolutely intolerable to the Tibetan people and all ethnic groups across the country and absolutely intolerable to the law of the country. Tibet has always been an inseparable part of China's territory, and the Tibetan ethnic group is a member of the great family of Chinese ethnic groups. The Tibet issue is China's internal affair, and no foreign interference is allowed. The actions of certain expansionist elements in India, inheriting the mantle of British imperialism's aggression, supporting the Tibetan reactionary group's rebellion, and demanding so-called "Tibetan independence," seriously undermine the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and damage the great friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples, not only arousing great anger among the Chinese people but also violating the interests of the Indian people.

The meeting unanimously and warmly congratulated the victory of the Central People's Government in quelling the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary group. The resolution pointed out: This great victory has further consolidated our country's national unity and ethnic unity, and ensured the smooth progress of national regional autonomy and social reform in Tibet. The meeting expressed its high respect for the heroic People's Liberation Army that was ordered to suppress the Tibetan rebel group and its high respect for the Tibetan monks and laypeople who assisted the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion.

The meeting then adopted the resolution on the work report of the Standing Committee; after listening to the report of the Proposals Examination Committee on the examination of proposals, it deliberated and adopted the resolution on the examination of proposals.

The meeting started at 9:20 a.m.

A total of 862 members attended today's meeting.

The executive chairmen of the meeting were Zhou Enlai, Peng Zhen, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Panchen Erdeni Qoigyijabu, Li Siguang, Bao Erhan, and Xu Bing.

    周恩来当选为中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会主席
    彭真、李济深、郭沫若、沈钧儒、黄炎培、李维汉、李四光、陈叔通、陈嘉庚、包尔汉、陈毅、康生、帕巴拉·卓列朗杰、阿沛·阿旺晋美当选为副主席
    班禅额尔德尼在会上郑重声明西藏问题只能在中国解决、严正指出对干涉者的警告完全是公正的
    据新华社29日讯　中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议今天上午闭幕。会议通过的政治决议，号召全国各族人民、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和一切爱国人士，进一步加强团结，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，坚决执行第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的各项决议，为完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划而奋斗，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的、繁荣的、富强的社会主义国家而继续前进。
    会议宣布了第三届全国委员会领导人员的选举结果：
    周恩来当选为中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会主席；
    彭真、李济深、郭沫若、沈钧儒、黄炎培、李维汉、李四光、陈叔通、陈嘉庚、包尔汉、陈毅、康生、帕巴拉·卓列朗杰、阿沛·阿旺晋美当选为副主席；
    徐冰当选为秘书长；
    王从吾等一百四十三人当选为常务委员。
    全体委员以不断的热烈掌声，欢庆第三届全国委员会领导人员的产生。
    在宣布选举结果之前，全体委员以暴风雨般的掌声欢迎班禅额尔德尼委员在大会上发言。
    班禅额尔德尼的这次发言谈到了印度尼赫鲁总理说他在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的发言“不公正”的问题。他严正地指出，“当我国内政受到外国狂妄干涉的时候，我站在维护祖国统一、维护民族团结、维护中印友谊的立场，表示义正词严的警告，这不但完全是公正的，而且完全是应该的。”
    在谈到关于尼赫鲁总理表示欢迎他去印度会见达赖喇嘛一事的时候，班禅额尔德尼郑重声明：“西藏问题只能在西藏解决，在中国解决，决不能在任何外国去解决。”
    班禅额尔德尼的发言，不时地为全场热烈的掌声所打断。（班禅额尔德尼的发言全文另发）
    会议通过了政治决议。决议说：全体委员一致热烈拥护第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告。会议深信，只要全国人民继续鼓足干劲，提高技术，厉行增产节约，努力克服困难，一九五九年宏伟的国民经济计划，是一定能够完成的。
    决议说，会议一致同意第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议所通过的关于西藏问题的决议。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团同帝国主义者和外国干涉者勾结起来，撕毁和平解放西藏的十七条协议，发动背叛祖国、破坏国家统一、残害西藏人民的武装叛乱，这是西藏人民和全国各族人民绝对不能容许的，是国法绝对不能容许的。西藏从来是中国领土的不可分割的一部分，藏族是中国各民族大家庭中的一员。西藏问题是中国的内政问题，决不容许外国人干涉。印度某些扩张主义分子继承英帝国主义侵略衣钵，支持西藏反动集团叛乱，要求所谓“西藏独立”的行为，严重地破坏和平共处的五项原则，损害中印两国人民的伟大友谊，不仅引起中国人民的极大愤怒，而且违反印度人民的利益。
    会议一致热烈祝贺中央人民政府平定西藏反动集团叛乱的胜利。决议指出：这一伟大胜利更加巩固了我国的国家统一和民族团结，保证了西藏地方的民族区域自治和社会改革的顺利进行。会议对于奉命讨伐西藏叛乱集团的英勇的人民解放军表示崇高的敬意，对于协助人民解放军平定叛乱的西藏僧俗人民表示崇高的敬意。
    会议接着通过了关于常务委员会工作报告的决议；在听取提案审查委员会关于提案的审查报告以后，审议并通过了关于提案审查的决议。
    会议在上午九时二十分开始。
    出席今天会议的委员共八百六十二人。
    大会执行主席是周恩来、彭真、李济深、郭沫若、沈钧儒、黄炎培、李维汉、陈叔通、班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞、李四光、包尔汉、徐冰。
