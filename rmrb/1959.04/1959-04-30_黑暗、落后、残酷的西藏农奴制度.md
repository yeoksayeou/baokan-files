Dark, Backward, and Cruel Serfdom in Tibet

On the bright and beautiful land of Tibet, which covers more than 1.22 million square kilometers and is rich in infinite treasures, there exists a kind of serfdom that is the darkest, most backward, and cruelest in the world. It sucks the blood and sweat of the Tibetan working people and hinders the economic and cultural development of Tibet.

I. Who Owns the Land in Tibet?

Tibetan society is basically divided into two major classes: feudal lords and serfs. Of the current 1.2 million people in Tibet, feudal lords and their government officials account for less than 5%. Farmers account for 60%, herdsmen account for 20%, and lamas account for 15%. In addition, there are a few handicraft workers and merchants. It is this less than 5% minority that occupies the main means of production in Tibet—all the land, including mountains, water, grasslands, forests, and other non-cultivated land. Due to the constraints of serfdom and the very backward agricultural technology, the level of production in Tibet is very low, with an average of about 150 jin of grain per person. All the land in Tibet is actually owned by the three major lords: the Tibetan local government, nobles, and monasteries. The three major lords each own about one-third of the land in Tibet.

The Tibetan local government is not only the largest feudal lord but also the tool of the serf-owner dictatorship. It holds the political power and the army to maintain its own class interests. The land directly owned by the Tibetan local government is called "Xiongxi" (Xiong means government; Xi means manor). In addition, it has the power to confer or confiscate the land of nobles and monasteries. The land of the nobles is called "Gexi." There are about two to three hundred noble families in Tibet, of which twenty to thirty hold the main political power in the Tibetan local government. Yutuo, Xia Geba, Pala and others who betrayed the motherland and fled to Kalimpong, India, are among the largest nobles in Tibet. Each noble family has an institution to manage the manor. The land of the monasteries is called "Quexi." The monasteries in Tibet all own manors. The income of the manors is entirely controlled by the upper-level lamas (these upper-level lamas also own private manors). Each monastery has a special institution to manage the manor.

II. The Serfs Attached to the Land Live a Miserable Life

The farmers in Tibet are all serfs attached to the land. They do not own an inch of land and can only cultivate a piece of land assigned by the lord. Serfs must spend two-thirds or even three-quarters of their time each year performing unpaid labor on the land of the serf-owners, supporting their extravagant parasitic life. Each serf household in Tibet generally cultivates from a few "ke" to thirty or forty "ke" of land, and very few cultivate more than fifty or sixty "ke." (Ke is a unit of measurement, which varies from place to place. Generally, one "ke" is about 25 jin. One "ke" of land is the land that sows 25 jin of seeds.)

Serfs are divided into three classes: "Chaba," "Duichong," and "Langsheng."

"Chaba," which means those who perform corvée labor, accounts for about 45% of the total number of serfs. They are the highest class of serfs. They cultivate a portion of land and have to provide both internal corvée labor to the lord and external corvée labor to the Tibetan local government. More than 70% of the "Chaba" are poor households, and the vast majority of the rest are also laborers. According to a survey in Bailangzong, only 1.5% of the "Chaba" are similar to landlords in the interior, transferring the contracted land to serfs and not participating in labor or only participating in incidental labor. "Duichong" (meaning small households) are derived from the bankruptcy and escape of Chaba, also accounting for 45% of the total number of serfs. The amount of land they cultivate and the livestock and farm tools they use are very small. Their lives are harder than those of the Chaba, and their social status is also lower than that of the Chaba. "Langsheng" are house slaves. They work for their masters for life. Their children do not belong to them and will still be "Langsheng" of the lord when they grow up. "Langsheng" are the serfs with the lowest social status and the worst living conditions in Tibet, close to slaves.

Serfs have no freedom. If the lord transfers the manor to someone else, the serfs, along with the land, livestock, and farm tools, are transferred to the new lord. If a serf wants to leave the land, he must obtain the lord's "permission." If a serf escapes without permission, he will be fined and subjected to cruel torture if caught. General manors own firearms, whips, leather slaps, and other instruments of torture. Lords and stewards have the power of life and death over serfs. They can arbitrarily whip, torture, and even cut off their noses, gouge out their eyes, cut off their limbs, and execute them by slow slicing. The children of serfs are registered in the books as successors of the serfs as soon as they are born.

Larger herds in Tibet belong to feudal lords. Their herds are managed by herdsmen who are attached to the grasslands and cannot leave freely.

The serfs and herdsmen in Tibet live a dark and hopeless life, and their enthusiasm for production is very low. When they can no longer endure it, they have to risk escaping to other places. As a result, a large amount of land in Tibet is abandoned every year.

These serfs who escape to other places to seek refuge with new lords are called "Yanhuhuo" among the "Duichong". They do not have fixed corvée labor in the new lord’s manor. They spend the rest of the time as hired laborers after paying about ten days of "Yanhuhuo" labor to the manor each year. The personal freedom of the "Yanhuhuo" is half-free. In addition to paying personal corvée tax to the lord, they can freely go anywhere. In fact, this is a method for serfs to fight for a half-free status through the struggle of escape.

III. The Form of Feudal Land Rent in Tibet

There are two forms of land rent in Tibet. The main one is corvée rent, and the other is a mixed rent of in-kind, corvée, and currency. A small portion adopts in-kind rent.

Corvée rent weighs heavily on the heads of the working people like a boulder, preventing them from turning over.

Lords usually divide their land into two parts: self-operated land and allotted land. They reserve about 70% of the best land for self-operation, and the rest is distributed to serfs as allotted land. All the labor required for the entire production process on the lord's self-operated land is borne by the serfs who are assigned land. This unpaid labor for the lord is called internal corvée labor. Internal corvée labor is mostly assigned by stewards. On average, each household of four people or cultivating about ten "ke" of land has to send one person to work for the lord all year round. In addition to field labor, they also have to perform chores such as mowing grass, threshing highland barley, and grinding highland barley. The grain harvested by the lord often accounts for 65% to 85% of the total land harvest. Usually, the lord assigns any work to the serfs. Serfs have to take turns going to the lord's house to work as servants, building houses for him, transporting grain and other items.... All this work is unpaid.

Serfs not only have to perform corvée labor for the lord but also have to perform corvée labor for the Tibetan local government. The labor performed by serfs for the Tibetan local government and the payment of in-kind and currency are called external corvée labor. External corvée labor is uniformly controlled by the Tibetan local government.

A considerable amount of land of the three major lords is specifically used for government corvée labor. This type of land is called "Chagang" land in Tibetan (Gang, each Gang is about forty to eighty "ke" of land). Anyone assigned "Chagang" land by the lord has to provide corvée labor and pay rent to the government according to regulations. One type of corvée labor is called "Dugang" labor, which mainly refers to transportation. This is the well-known "Ula," including the unpaid supply of manpower and animal power to transport all personnel and goods holding licenses from the Tibetan local government; unpaid corvée labor for the construction designated by the Tibetan local government or the Tibetan local government; reception of visiting officials and public servants and Tibetan soldiers of the Tibetan local government, providing them with free food and lodging and transportation; and payment of all the supplies needed by the Tibetan local government, including butter, highland barley, firewood, fodder, paper, etc. The maximum amount of a Dugang's corvée labor is more than 500 man-days, more than 400 animal-days, plus supplies and currency; the minimum is more than 200 man-days, more than 100 animal-days, plus some supplies and currency. One type of corvée labor is called "Magang" labor, which is to replace land rent with military service. Anyone cultivating one Gang of "Magang" land has to provide a certain number of soldiers according to the regulations of the Tibetan local government and supply some of the food and clothing for the soldiers provided.

In-kind rent generally accounts for one-third of the land income (there are also half-and-half shares and four-six shares). The in-kind rent of serfs includes not only crops but also some handicraft products, such as weaving pulu for the serf-owner according to the quota, frying zanba on behalf of the serf-owner, and supplying pockets. Many serfs are also handicraft workers, and they also have to pay in-kind. Those who make pottery have to pay pottery, and those who make wooden bowls have to pay wooden bowls.

In addition, usury and head tax are also sucking the blood and sweat of the Tibetan working people.

The Tibetan local government, nobles, and monasteries all lend at usurious rates. After liberation, interest rates were lowered. The Tibetan local government borrowed ten and returned eleven, while nobles and monasteries borrowed five and returned six or borrowed six and returned seven. Eighty to ninety percent of serfs in Tibet owe debts to serf-owners. Moreover, due to the high interest rates, interest is added to interest, and debts cannot be repaid for a long time. Some accumulated grain debts amount to more than 10,000 "ke." There are also debts that have been owed for more than a hundred years and cannot be repaid. This kind of debt that cannot be repaid for generations has actually become a means for serf-owners to further bind serfs to the land.

The amount of head tax varies from place to place, and it also differs depending on the serf's physical strength and skill level. The amount of tax paid is sometimes two or three taels of Tibetan silver per year, sometimes eight to ten taels; the most is 150 taels. Tax payment starts at the age of eighteen and stops at the age of sixty.

IV. The Heavy Shackles Are About to Be Broken

The "Resolution on the Tibetan Issue" passed by the First Session of the Second National People's Congress on April 28, 1959, pointed out: "The current social system in Tibet is an extremely backward serf system. The extent of the exploitation, oppression, and cruelty of serf-owners towards the working people is rare in the world. Even those who claim to 'sympathize' with the Tibetan bandits cannot explain why they are so enthusiastic about supporting this backward system. The Tibetan people have long firmly demanded the reform of their social system, and many enlightened people in the upper and middle classes also realize that without reform, the Tibetan nation will have no possibility of prosperity. Since the rebellion of the reactionary elements of the former Tibetan local government against reform has been quelled, the reform demands of the broad masses of the Tibetan people have been given the conditions for smooth realization. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region should, in accordance with the Constitution, the wishes of the broad masses of the Tibetan people, and the characteristics of Tibetan socio-economic culture, gradually implement the democratic reform of Tibet, rescue the Tibetan people from misery, so as to lay the foundation for building a prosperous and strong socialist New Tibet." The dark, backward, and cruel serf system that weighs heavily on the working people of Tibet will be gradually changed, and the serfs will be liberated. The people of the whole country are cheering for their imminent new life. (Domestic Materials Group of this newspaper)

### 黑暗、落后、残酷的西藏农奴制度

    黑暗、落后、残酷的西藏农奴制度
    在西藏这块一百二十二万多平方公里的明媚秀丽、蕴藏无限宝藏的土地上，保存着一种世界上最黑暗、落后、残酷的农奴制度。它吮干了西藏劳动人民的血汗，阻碍了西藏经济文化的发展。一、西藏的土地归谁所有？
    西藏社会基本上分为封建领主和农奴两大阶级。西藏现有的一百二十万人口中，封建领主和他们的政府官员不足5％。农民占60％，牧民占20％，喇嘛占15％。此外还有少数的手工业者和商人。正是这不足5％的少数人，占有了西藏地方的主要生产资料——全部土地，包括山、水、草地、森林和其他非耕地。西藏由于受着农奴制度的束缚和十分落后的农业技术的限制，生产水平很低，每人平均占有粮食约一百五十斤。西藏的全部土地实际上归西藏地方政府、贵族和寺庙三大领主所有。三大领主大约各领有全藏土地的三分之一。
  西藏地方政府不仅是最大的封建领主，而且是农奴主专政的工具，它掌握着政权和军队用来维护自己的阶级利益。西藏地方政府直接领有的土地叫“雄溪”（雄，就是官府；溪，就是庄园）。此外，它对贵族和寺庙的土地有封赐或没收的权力。贵族的土地叫“格溪”。西藏大约有贵族二、三百家，其中在西藏地方政府掌握主要政治权力的有二、三十家。叛离祖国、逃往印度噶伦堡的宇妥、夏格巴、帕拉等人都是西藏最大的贵族。每一家贵族都设有管理庄园的机构。寺院的土地叫“却溪”。西藏的寺庙都拥有庄园。庄园的收入全为上层喇嘛所操纵（这些上层喇嘛还拥有私人庄园）。每一座寺庙都设有专门管理庄园的机构。
    二、附着在土地上的农奴过着悲惨的生活
    西藏的农民都是附着在土地上的农奴。他们连一寸土地也没有，只能耕种领主分给的一份土地。农奴每年要拿出三分之二甚至四分之三的时间，在农奴主的土地上进行无偿的劳役，供养他们过奢华的寄生生活。西藏的农奴每户种的土地一般由几克到三、四十克，很少有超过五、六十克的。（克，是一种量制，各地不统一，普通一克约为二十五斤。一克地，就是播种二十五斤种子的土地）
    农奴分“差巴”、“堆穷”、“朗生”三个阶层。
  “差巴”，就是支差人，约占农奴总数的45％。他们是农奴中地位最高的阶层。他们领种一份份地，既要向领主支应内差，又要向西藏地方政府支应外差。70％以上的差巴是贫苦户，其余绝大多数也是劳动者。据白朗宗调查，只有1.5％的“差巴”类似内地的二地主，把承包的土地转给农奴，自己不参加劳动或仅参加附带劳动。“堆穷”（就是小户），是从差巴破产、逃亡而分化出来的，也占农奴总数的45％，他们耕种的土地和使用的牲畜、农具，数量很小，生活比差巴还苦，社会地位也比差巴低。“朗生”就是家奴，他们终生替主人干活，他们生的子女也不能属于自己，将来长大了仍然要作领主的“朗生”。“朗生”是西藏农奴中社会地位最低、生活条件最苦的农奴，近于奴隶。
    农奴是没有自由的。领主如果把庄园转给别人，农奴就连同土地、牲畜、农具一起转移到新领主手中。农奴如果要离开土地，必须得到领主的“请准”。如果农奴私自逃跑，一旦被捉回来，就要罚款并且处以酷刑。一般庄园都拥有枪支、皮鞭、皮巴掌等刑具。领主、管家对农奴具有生杀予夺的大权，他们可以随意对农奴加以鞭笞、拷打，甚至加以割鼻、挖眼、砍去四肢，凌迟处死。农奴的子女一诞生下来就被登记在簿子上列为农奴的后继者。
    西藏较大的牧群都属封建领主所有，他们的牧群由牧奴经营，他们附着在草地上，不能自由离去。
    西藏的农奴和牧奴过着暗无天日的生活，生产情绪非常低。到实在无法忍受的时候，只有冒着危险逃亡到别的地方去。西藏每年都有大量土地因此荒芜。
    这些逃亡到别的地方去投靠新领主的农奴，叫做“堆穷”中的烟火户，他们在新领主那里没有固定的差役，大约每年为庄园出十天左右的烟火差之外，其余时间可以当雇工度日。烟火户的人身是半自由的，他们除向领主缴人役税外，可以自由到任何地方去。实际上这是农奴用逃亡的斗争方法，争取到了半自由的身份。
      三、西藏的封建地租形式
    西藏的地租形式有两种，主要的一种是劳役地租，另一种是实物、劳役、货币混合的地租。也有一小部分采用实物地租。
    劳役地租像大石块一样沉重地压在劳动人民的头顶上，使他们不能翻身。
    领主多把自己的土地分为自营地和份地两部分。他们把百分之七十左右最好的土地留下来自营，其余的部分作为份地分给农奴。领主自营地上的全部生产过程所需要的劳役都由分得份地的农奴来承担。这种为领主的无偿的劳役，叫作内差。内差多由管家分配。平均每户四口人或种十克土地左右的就要出一人为领主长年工作。除进行田间劳动外，还要作打草、打稞、磨青稞等杂役。领主收获的粮食往往占到全部土地收获的65％到85％。平时领主有什么工作都要分派到农奴头上。农奴要轮流到领主家里作家仆，替他建盖房屋、搬运粮食和其他物品……。这一切工作都是没有报酬的。
    农奴不但要向领主支差役，而且要向西藏地方政府支差役。农奴为西藏地方政府支应劳役和交纳实物与货币，就叫作外差。外差由西藏地方政府统一掌握。
  三大领主的土地中有相当多的土地专门为政府支差，这种土地藏语称为“差岗”地（岗，每岗约为四十至八十克土地）。凡有领主分给“差岗”地的，就要按规定给政府支差纳租。一种差叫“都岗差”，主要指运输，就是人们较为熟知的“乌拉”，包括无偿的供应人畜力，以运送执有西藏地方政府执照的一切人员和货物；无偿地为西藏地方政府或西藏地方政府指定的修建服徭役；接待西藏地方政府过往官员公差人员、藏兵，无偿地供给其食宿和运输力；交纳西藏地方政府所需的一切实物，包括酥油、青稞、柴草、马料、纸张等。一个都岗的差额最多一年要出五百多个人工，四百多个畜工，另加实物和货币；最少也要出二百多个人工，一百多个畜工，外加部分的实物和货币。一种差叫“马岗差”，就是以兵役顶替地租。凡种“马岗地”一岗的，就要按西藏地方政府的规定出一定的兵额，并供给所出兵役的一部分食物和衣着。
    实物地租一般占土地收入三分之一（也有对半分、四六分的）。农奴的实物地租除农作物以外，还包括一部分手工业产品，如代农奴主纺织定额的氆氇，代炒糌粑，供应口袋等。不少农奴兼为手工业者，他们也要交实物，制陶器的就交陶器，制木碗的就交木碗。
    除此以外，还有高利贷和人役税也在吸吮着西藏劳动人民的血汗。
    西藏地方政府、贵族、寺庙都放高利贷。解放后降低了利率，西藏地方政府借十还十一，贵族和寺庙借五还六或借六还七。全西藏有百分之八、九十的农奴向农奴主借债。而且由于利息很高，利上加利，久久不能还清，有的积欠粮债竟达一万克以上。也有欠债百年以上而无法还清的。这种世世代代还不清的子孙债实际已经成为农奴主进一步把农奴束缚在土地上的手段。
    人役税各地数量不一，同时又依农奴身体强弱、技术高低而不同，纳税数目有的每年交二三两藏银，有的交八至十两；最多的要交一百五十两。从十八岁开始纳税，到六十岁停止。
      四、沉重的枷锁快要被打碎了
    1959年4月28日第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过“关于西藏问题的决议”中指出：“西藏现在的社会制度是一种极其落后的农奴制度，农奴主对于劳动人民的剥削、压迫、残害的惨酷程度是世界上少有的，甚至那些口口声声‘同情’西藏叛匪的人，也说不出他们为什么硬要热心于支持这种落后制度的理由。西藏人民久已坚决要求改革自己的社会制度，许多上中层开明人士也认识到，如不改革，西藏民族断无繁荣昌盛的可能。由于反对改革的原西藏地方政府反动分子的叛乱已经平定，西藏广大人民的改革要求，已经得到顺利实现的条件。西藏自治区筹备委员会应当根据宪法，根据西藏广大人民的愿望和西藏社会经济文化的特点，逐步实现西藏的民主改革，出西藏人民于水火，以便为建设繁荣昌盛的社会主义的新西藏奠定基础。”沉重地压在西藏劳动人民身上的黑暗、落后、残酷的农奴制度将逐步地加以改变，农奴将要获得解放。全国人民都为他们即将获得新生而欢欣鼓舞。　（本报国内资料组）
