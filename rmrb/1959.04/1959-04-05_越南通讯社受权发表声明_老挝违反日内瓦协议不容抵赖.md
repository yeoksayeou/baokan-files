Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 4th. The Vietnam News Agency today issued a statement regarding the remarks made by Sisouk Na Champassak, Deputy Minister of Propaganda of the Royal Lao Government, to an Agence France-Presse reporter on March 26, denying Laos' violation of the Geneva Accords. In his remarks, Sisouk Na Champassak stubbornly insisted that Laos had not violated the Geneva Accords and had no intention of denying them. He also denied that the United States had invaded Laos and that Laos had any intention of joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The statement issued by the Vietnam News Agency pointed out that Sisouk Na Champassak's above remarks were completely inconsistent with the facts and were intended to deceive domestic and international public opinion. The statement said that the fact is that the pro-American elements in the Royal Lao Government have not only failed to fully implement the Geneva Accords on the Laotian issue, but have also constantly violated the agreement. Especially after the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos temporarily suspended its activities, these violations of the Geneva Accords on the Laotian issue have continued to occur more seriously.

The statement said that former Pathet Lao combat personnel returning to their respective areas have been subjected to discrimination and retaliation by the Lao authorities and have been restricted from leaving their villages. Hundreds of people have been arrested, imprisoned, and tortured by the Lao local authorities. These actions violate the provisions of Article 15 of the Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos.

The statement said that as for the military provisions of the aforementioned agreement, the Royal Lao Government has in fact allowed hundreds of American military personnel to enter Laos and has imported hundreds of tons of American weapons into Laos under the guise of so-called "aid materials" and "machinery and equipment." The United Press International of the United States also acknowledged on March 25 that most of the military equipment in Laos is currently supplied by the United States.

The statement said that everyone knows that some responsible officials of the Royal Lao Government have repeatedly declared that the Kingdom of Laos accepts the so-called "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The Royal Lao Government has also sent representatives to participate in the military exercises held by this military bloc in Thailand last year and this year.

The statement pointed out that the fact is that the reactionary elements in the Royal Lao Government have allowed the secret agents and spies of the South Vietnamese authorities in Laos to carry out sabotage activities against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and have allowed the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's clique from Taiwan to carry out provocative activities against the People's Republic of China on Laotian territory. The reactionary pro-American elements in the Royal Lao Government, under the instigation and assistance of U.S. imperialism, have created tensions on the Vietnamese-Laotian and Chinese-Laotian borders and have spread slanderous remarks against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to establish a dictatorial system in Laos through this artificial tension, in order to strengthen the suppression of Laotian patriots, especially former Pathet Lao combat personnel, and to pave the way for Laos to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The statement said that, in fact, no one would forget that Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone once declared that the implementation of the Geneva Accords on the Laotian issue had been completed and that Laos would no longer be bound by the Geneva Accords. Subsequently, the U.S. State Department hastily supported this view; the U.S. propaganda apparatus believed that it was already time for Laos to freely accept U.S. military aid and become a formal member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The statement pointed out that the indisputable fact is that The Royal Lao Government has seriously violated Articles 6, 7, 9, and 15 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos and paragraphs 4 and

    越南通讯社受权发表声明
    老挝违反日内瓦协议不容抵赖
    新华社河内4日电　越南通讯社今天就老挝王国政府宣传部副大臣西苏·纳占巴萨3月26日向法新社记者发表的抵赖老挝违反日内瓦协议的谈话发表声明。西苏·纳占巴萨在谈话中硬说，老挝没有违反日内瓦协议，也没有否认这个协议的意图。他还抵赖说，美国并没有侵入老挝，老挝丝毫没有加入东南亚条约组织的意图。
    越南通讯社发表的声明指出，西苏·纳占巴萨的上述谈话完全不符合事实，其目的在于蒙蔽国内和国际舆论。声明说，事实是，老挝王国政府中的亲美分子不但没有完满地履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，而且不断地违反了这项协议。尤其是在老挝国际监察和监督委员会暂时停止它的活动以后，这种违反关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的行动更加严重地继续发生。
    声明说，回到各自地区的前寮国战斗部队人员受到老挝当局的歧视、报复，并且被限制离开他们的村庄。成百人遭到老挝地方当局逮捕、监禁和拷打。这些行动都违反了日内瓦会议关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定第十五条的规定。
    声明说，至于谈到上述协定的各项军事条款，老挝王国政府已经在事实上允许成百名美国军事人员进入老挝，并且在所谓“援助物资”和“机器设备”的伪装下，把成百吨美国武器输入老挝。美国国际合众社3月25日也已经承认，目前老挝的大部分军事装备是由美国供给的。
    声明说，任何人都知道，老挝王国政府的一些负责官员曾经不断宣称老挝王国接受东南亚条约组织的所谓“保护”。老挝王国政府还曾经派遣代表参加这个军事集团去年和今年在泰国举行的军事演习。
    声明指出，事实是，老挝王国政府中的反动分子曾经允许在老挝的南越当局的特务和间谍向越南民主共和国进行破坏活动，并且允许台湾蒋介石集团的残余军队在老挝国土上向中华人民共和国进行挑衅活动。老挝王国政府中的反动亲美分子在美帝国主义的指使和帮助下，制造了越老和中老边境的紧张局势，并且散布诬蔑越南民主共和国的言论，企图通过这种人为的紧张局势在老挝建立独裁制度，以加强对老挝爱国人士、特别是前寮国战斗部队人员的镇压，并且为老挝加入东南亚条约组织开辟道路。
    声明说，事实上，任何人也不会忘记，培·萨纳尼空首相曾经宣称，关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的履行已经完成，老挝将不再受日内瓦协议的约束。接着，美国国务院就急忙加以支持；美国宣传机构认为，已经是老挝可以自由接受美国的军事援助和成为东南亚条约组织的正式成员的时候了。
    声明指出，不容置辩的事实是，老挝王国政府严重地违反了日内瓦会议关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定的第六、第七、第九、第十五条的规定和日内瓦会议最后宣言的第四和第五段，并且背弃了老挝王国政府在日内瓦会议上所作的保证。声明说，老挝王国政府中的反动分子正在遵循美帝国主义的侵略政策，阴谋把老挝变成美国的军事基地，为把老挝拉入东南亚条约组织扫清道路，以便在这个地区准备新的战争，从而威胁着老挝、印度支那和东南亚地区的和平。声明说，这些反动分子为了掩盖他们的行动，正在千方百计地阻挠老挝国际监察和监督委员会的继续进行活动。
    声明指出，老挝王国政府中的亲美反动分子的上述行动导致老挝局势的紧张，破坏了老挝的民族团结，损害了希望和平安宁、建设国家、民族和睦以及同各邻国建立友好关系的老挝人民和老挝王国的利益。
    声明最后指出，老挝人民以及东南亚和全世界爱好和平的人民将一定能够揭穿美帝国主义及其在老挝的走狗的罪恶阴谋，并且使它遭到破产。
