Two Poems
		Qian Junrui
	By the Taihu Lake in Wuxi
		(Tune: Yu Meiren)
	Thirty-six thousand hectares of vast waves, the mountains darkening at dusk. Turtle Head Isle hangs with horizontal clouds, dots of returning sails sing the evening song of fishermen. How much of the lake and mountain scenery have I seen, but only today is the best! Thirty years of past events passed by hastily, but it is delightful to see my hometown bathed in the east wind like a painting.
	Hometown Residence Amidst the Cries of Returning Geese
		(Tune: Qing Ping Yue)
	The returning boat has arrived, few pedestrians on the paths. The murmuring local accent is especially good, white hair returns but not yet old. Aunt leads the way to see the canteen, nephew chats about sericulture. I love the humble room of my childhood the most, expediently changed into a workshop.

    词二首
    钱俊瑞
    无锡太湖之滨
    （虞美人）
    浩波三万六千顷，向暮群山暝。鼋头渚上挂横云，点点归帆唱晚渔家人。湖光山色见多少，只有今朝好！卅年往事恁匆匆，恰喜故乡如画浴东风。
    返鸿声里故居
    （清平乐）
    归棹到了，陌上行人少。喃呢乡音分外好，华发归来未老。婶娘领看食堂，侄儿絮语蚕桑。最爱儿时陋室，权宜改作工场。
