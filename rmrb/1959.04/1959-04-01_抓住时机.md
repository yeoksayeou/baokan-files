Seize the Opportunity

Today is the first day of the second quarter. Based on past experience and the current situation, the second quarter is a crucial quarter for fulfilling and overfulfilling the annual production and construction plan. We must seize this opportunity, strive for high yields every day and every ten-day period, and lay a solid foundation for the victorious completion of this year's plan.

"Time and tide wait for no man" is an objective truth. Time is like the Yangtze River, flowing relentlessly, never to return. "After today, there is tomorrow, and after tomorrow, there is the day after tomorrow." This is just the "philosophy" of the lazy. The attitude of the promoters is "opportunity knocks but once." Isn't time fleeting? We must seize it tightly, compete for every second, and not relax for a moment. Isn't the time in a day limited? We will start by improving production technology and tools, and strive to improve labor productivity, so as to do more work in the same amount of time. The ancients said, "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold." Today's heroes want "one day to equal twenty years." We are seizing time in this way and working tirelessly for the victory of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, and for the successful realization of the annual plan.

"Opportunity knocks but once" also has another meaning. That is, to seize the favorable situation. For example, the all-round great leap forward of the national economy that began last year was the Party seizing the favorable situation after the rectification movement and leading the people of the whole country to carry it out. Now, a new and larger-scale production upsurge has arrived. The competition upsurge of "creating new achievements and striving to go to Beijing" is rising. This is a major feature on the economic front in the second quarter. We should seize this favorable opportunity, "add fuel to the fire," make the production upsurge even more magnificent, and make the fruits of production even more abundant.

Grasping opportunities, striving for advancement instead of lagging behind, is an art of leadership. Mastering this art makes work proactive.

### 抓住时机

    抓住时机
    今天是第二季度开始的第一天。按照过去的经验和今年的情况来看，第二季度是完成和超额完成全年生产建设计划的决定性的季度，我们必须紧紧抓住这个时机，力争日日高产，旬旬高产，为胜利完成今年计划打下巩固基础。
      “时不再来”，是一个客观真理。时间像长江之水，滚滚流逝，一去不返。“过了今天还有明天，过了明天还有后天。”这只是懒人的“哲学”。而促进派的态度是“机不可失”。时间不是稍纵即逝吗？我们就紧紧抓住它，分秒必争，一时一刻也不放松；一天的时间不是有限吗？我们就从提高生产技术、改进工具等方面入手，努力提高劳动生产率，争取在同一时间内干更多的活儿。古人说：“一寸光阴一寸金”。今日的英雄要“一天等于二十年”。我们就是这样抓紧时间，为钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标、为全年计划的胜利实现奋斗不懈。
    “机不可失”还有一层意思。这就是要抓紧有利的形势。例如，去年开始的国民经济的全面大跃进，就是党抓紧整风运动后的有利形势，领导全国人民开展起来的。现在，新的更大规模的生产高潮到来了。“创造新成绩，争取上北京”的竞赛热潮正在高涨。这是第二季度经济战线上的一个重大特点。我们应该抓住这个有利时机，“推波助澜”，使生产高潮更加壮阔，让生产果实更加丰硕。
    抓时机，赶前不赶后，是一门领导艺术。掌握了这门艺术，工作上就主动了。
