    Xiang Xiuli Walks By with a Smile...
    Xiang Ming

Who says Xiang Xiuli is dead? She lives forever among us. Look, she is full of smiles, working and singing with us...

Xiang Xiuli walks into the workshop with a smile, and the production quota is exceeded tenfold or a hundredfold. The name of the "Xiuli Class" on the honor roll shines brightly, and the red stars are like a brilliant Milky Way!

Xiang Xiuli walks into the fields with a smile, and the fields are busy with spring planting. The red flag of the "Xiang Xiuli Team" is as red as fire, and the hearts of the shock team members are hotter than fire!

Xiang Xiuli walks into the school with a smile, and the Youth League branch meeting is in full swing. The Communist Youth League members are passionately discussing: We must learn from Sister Xiuli and dedicate our youth to the motherland!

Xiang Xiuli walks to the border with a smile, and the soldiers raise their weapons and swear: If one day the enemy dares to invade, we will use our lives to extinguish the flames of war like you!

Xiang Xiuli will always walk among us, throwing herself into the boiling life with full enthusiasm. Look, she is full of smiles, sharing our hardships and sharing our joys...

    向秀丽含着微笑走过……
    向明谁说向秀丽已经死去？她永远在我们中间活着，你看她满面含着微笑，和我们一起劳动，一起唱歌……向秀丽含着微笑走到车间，生产定额被十倍百倍地突破，光荣榜上“秀丽班”的名字金
  光四射，红星颗颗好像灿烂的银河！向秀丽含着微笑走到田野，田野里正在紧张地春播，
  “向秀丽队”的红旗鲜红如火，突击队员的心呵比火热得多！向秀丽含着微笑走到学校，团支部大会正在热烈地开着，共青团员们在满怀激情地讨
    论：要学秀丽姐姐把青春献给祖
  国！向秀丽含着微笑走到边疆，战士们高举武器宣誓说：如果有一天敌人胆敢侵犯，我们像你一样用生命去扑灭战
  火！向秀丽永远走在我们中间，干劲冲天地投入沸腾的生活，你看她满面含着微笑，和我们分担艰苦，共享欢乐……
