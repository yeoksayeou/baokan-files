    Great Victory of the Hungarian People on the Economic Front
    Chen Gang
    The past year, for Hungary, like other members of the socialist family, was also an extraordinary year. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, resolutely representing the interests of the people, implemented correct policies, relied on the masses, and victoriously led the people of the whole country to further consolidate the proletarian regime, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, develop the national economy, and improve the people's livelihood, thus winning greater support and trust from the people of the whole country. Today's Hungary is stronger than at any time in history. This was most powerfully demonstrated in the great victory of the Hungarian National Assembly and local council elections last November. The country, which suffered from counter-revolutionary riots more than two years ago, has now rapidly healed the wounds brought by the counter-revolution and is moving forward from victory to victory with more vigorous steps.
    In the first half of last year, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party proposed a three-year plan for the development of the national economy to the people of the whole country. The plan stipulates that within the three years from 1958 to 1960, industrial production should be increased by 22%, agricultural production should be increased by 12%-13% under normal years, national income should be increased by 13%, total investment should reach 32 billion forints, and the people's living standards should be improved by 6%. The smooth completion of the three-year plan will lay a solid foundation for the second five-year plan starting in 1961.
    Now, the hardworking and brave Hungarian people have victoriously completed and overfulfilled the first year's task stipulated in the three-year plan, and are welcoming the greater victory of the new year with redoubled confidence. In 1958, industrial production increased by 12% compared with 1957, exceeding the original plan by 4.7%. The original plan was to increase labor productivity by 6.4%, but the actual result was an increase of 8%. Although agricultural production suffered from a poor grain harvest due to drought, the total output value still completed the planned target and increased by 5% compared with 1957, thanks to the development of animal husbandry and the bumper harvest of grapes and fruits. The foreign trade plan was executed particularly well. The export plan was overfulfilled by 12%, and the import plan was overfulfilled by 2%.
    A major feature of Hungary's economic achievements in 1958 was the achievement of a balance between the national economy and the balance of payments by relying on its own strength. The large overfulfillment of the export plan in foreign trade has reversed the long-standing unfavorable situation of trade deficits. This is a significant victory for the Hungarian people.
    The over-planned growth of industrial production has brought about an additional investment of 1.5 billion forints. At the same time, the people's living standards, which were improved in 1957, have not only been consolidated but have continued to improve. In the past year, residents' savings deposits increased by 1 billion forints, which is equivalent to the total amount of residents' savings deposits in the year before the counter-revolutionary riot. This not only marks the improvement of the people's living standards, but also shows the great trust and support of the working people for the Party and the government.
    The attainment of all these achievements is due to the fact that the Party and the government vigorously strengthened the leadership of the national economy last year and solved various problems in production in a timely and effective manner. For example, the supply of raw materials has always been a major problem in Hungarian industrial production. 80% of basic raw materials rely on imports, and raw materials and semi-finished products account for 70% of annual imports. Many factories often stop work due to insufficient supply of raw materials, and production capacity cannot be fully utilized. In order to get rid of this difficulty in industry, reduce raw material imports, and improve the export capacity of products, the Party proposed a policy of rationally adjusting the industrial production structure at the beginning of last year. On the one hand, increase the production of basic raw materials and labor-saving and material-saving products; on the other hand, reduce or stop the production of some material-intensive products that are difficult to export. This policy has changed the long-standing serious imbalance between the basic raw material production sector and the processing and manufacturing sector. Moreover, due to the large-scale production of high-pressure equipment, communication equipment, precision instruments, diesel locomotives, and medicines, the export situation of foreign trade has been effectively improved.
    At the same time, in order to change the difficult situation of raw material supply and make production "economical and good," the government also launched a call for a conservation movement to the national workers and staff. This call has been warmly supported by the working masses. Many factories have put forward guarantees for saving raw materials. The Csepel Iron and Steel United Enterprise in Budapest alone saved the country property worth 100 million forints last year. In addition, in order to oppose the waste of state property, a system of people's supervisors has been established throughout the country. 24,000 selfless people's supervisors effectively perform the glorious task of protecting state property. The establishment, restoration and strengthening of factory committees and production meetings have had a good effect on expanding enterprise democracy, stimulating the enthusiasm and creativity of workers and staff, providing many beneficial suggestions for production improvement and technological improvement, and directly promoting the improvement of productivity and the consolidation of labor discipline.
    In the past year, the Hungarian Party has also taken many measures to consolidate and develop agricultural cooperatives. Thanks to the correct leadership and strong support of the state for the cooperatives, the cooperatives have been further consolidated politically, economically and organizationally in the past year, improved production and management, and increased public livestock. Last year, the income of cooperative animal husbandry exceeded that of crop production. Public funds have increased. Last year, the fixed assets of each cooperative per holder increased from 23,000 forints in 1955 to 38,000 forints. The output value per hundred holder also increased from 360,000 forints in 1955 to 420,000 forints. Last year, the cooperatives were less affected by the drought than individual farmers, and the average grain production was 20% higher than that of individual farmers. These situations powerfully demonstrate the superiority of large-scale cooperative management. With the consolidation of the cooperatives, the number of cooperatives also increased last year. 400 new cooperatives were established, and the cooperative land increased by 250,000 holders.
    At the beginning of this new year, the Hungarian collectivization movement has taken off with the spring breeze. Since January, the collectivization movement has been rapidly developing in Győr-Sopron County on the western border, and the progress is getting faster and faster, and the momentum is getting bigger and bigger. Entering February, the movement has set off an unprecedented upsurge in many areas of the country with great momentum. Whole townships and districts have joined the cooperatives, and large numbers of middle peasants have bid farewell to the individual management methods and embarked on the road of collective production. As of March 1, the cultivated land area of cooperatives has increased sharply by one million holders. Győr-Sopron and Szolnok counties have been completely collectivized. Veszprém, Fejér, and Komárom counties have also exceeded half or are close to basic collectivization. The national socialist agricultural component, calculated by cultivated land area, has increased from 26.5% at the end of 1958 (including 13% of state-owned farms) to more than 40%.
    This brilliant achievement is the result of implementing the Party's correct policies in the past two years. According to the domestic and international situation, the Socialist Workers' Party passed a resolution in December last year to accelerate the collectivization movement. The resolution pointed out that collectivization is a cause for the entire society at present, calling on all social forces, the whole Party and the whole people to take action. At the same time, the resolution stipulated a series of specific policies and measures according to the characteristics of the countryside. Once the resolution was published, it immediately sparked heated discussions at the congresses of Party members and activists in various places, quickly grasped the minds of cadres, and exerted great power. Győr-Sopron County took the lead in this movement and played a promoting role. Under the leadership of the county Party committee, the county criticized incorrect views on the basis of the December resolution, unified the understanding of cadres, and gave play to the spirit of pioneering according to the specific conditions and characteristics of the local area, mobilized all positive factors, and adopted flexible methods, and went deep into the masses to carry out patient propaganda and organization work day and night. In the process of the development of the movement, the central government also summarized the successful experience of Győr-Sopron County in a timely manner and promoted it.
    The peasants who have won a great victory in the collectivization movement are high-spirited and enthusiastic. While reorganizing their ranks and consolidating the cooperatives from the political organization, they are also setting up positions on the production front without stopping to welcome the battle of spring plowing and spring sowing.
    The rapid development of collectivization has also promoted the production of industrial sectors, especially those related to agriculture. The Hungarian working class, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, has made significant contributions to the collectivization propaganda and organization work, and later extended a helping hand in promoting cooperative production. The workers of agricultural machinery and pesticide factories, under the call of the Party, have held meetings to discuss how to complete and overfulfill the production plan ahead of schedule to support the cooperative peasant brothers. One good news after another came. The workers of the Emoge Agricultural Tools and Machinery Factory guaranteed to overproduce 50 combine harvesters to support the cooperatives. The workers of the Transportation Equipment Factory will rush to manufacture 200 feed harvesters and send them to the countryside before the harvest. The workers of the Red Star Tractor Factory proposed a guarantee to overproduce 150 tractors and spare parts worth 2 million forints. The Győr Machine Tool Factory guaranteed that in addition to overfulfilling the production tasks, it would also organize voluntary labor teams to build livestock pens for nearby cooperatives during holidays. The factory director, the Party committee secretary, and the trade union chairman also participated in voluntary labor with the workers.
    At this time, the Party Central Committee held a plenary session on March 6, analyzed the favorable international situation in depth, fully estimated the favorable domestic conditions, and made a heroic call to the people of the whole country to strive to complete the main indicators of the three-year plan in two years; for this reason, it is required that this year's industrial production target be overfulfilled by 4%, agricultural production should overfulfill the original production plan of increasing production by 5.2%, to ensure the implementation of this year's 13.2 billion forints investment plan, the industrial production cost should be changed from the original plan to reduce by 1.5% to 2.5%, labor productivity should be changed from the original plan to increase by 3% to 5%, national income is required to increase by 8.3%, and the actual wages of workers and staff should increase by 5% to 6%. In order to ensure the completion of this great task, call on all enterprises to organize socialist labor competitions.
    This inspiring battle call of the Hungarian Workers' Party is forming a huge driving force to encourage the Hungarian people to move forward bravely. Many factories have responded to the Party's call and put forward specific guarantees. More and more workers are forming socialist labor teams and challenging each other. Recently, the Budapest Municipal Party Committee, according to the central government's resolution, called on all workers and staff in Budapest to take the lead, and to carry out a socialist labor competition on a large scale to "better, faster, and more economically" complete the production tasks to welcome the Party Congress to be held at the end of the year. A large-scale and vigorous socialist competition movement will soon be launched throughout the country.
  Under the leadership of the hardworking and heroic Hungarian people in the Socialist Workers' Party, for a better and happier tomorrow, we are advancing confidently and victoriously.

    匈牙利人民在经济战线上的大胜利
    陈岗
    过去的一年，对匈牙利来说，同社会主义大家庭的其他成员一样，也是不平凡的一年。匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府坚决地代表着人民的利益，实行了正确的政策，依靠群众，胜利地领导着全国人民进一步巩固了无产阶级政权，加强了工农联盟，发展了国民经济，改善了人民生活，从而赢得了全国人民的更大支持和信任。今天的匈牙利比历史上任何时期都更坚强了。这一点在去年11月匈牙利国民议会和地方议会选举的伟大胜利中得到了最有力的说明。这个两年多以前曾遭受过反革命暴乱袭击的国家，现在已迅速医治了反革命带来的创伤，以更矫健的步伐从胜利走向胜利。
    去年上半年，匈牙利社会主义工人党向全国人民提出了发展国民经济的三年计划。计划规定1958——1960三年内工业生产要提高22％，农业生产在一般的年成下要提高12％——13％，国民收入要增长13％，投资总额要达三百二十亿福林，人民生活水平要提高6％。三年计划的顺利完成，将为1961年开始的第二个五年计划奠定巩固的基础。
    现在，勤劳勇敢的匈牙利人民已经胜利地完成和超额完成了三年计划规定的第一年任务，并以加倍的信心迎接着新的一年的更大胜利。1958年工业生产较1957年增长了12％，超过原订计划的4.7％。劳动生产率原定提高6.4％，而实际执行的结果提高了8％。农业生产方面虽因干旱致使谷物歉收，但由于畜牧业的发展和葡萄水果的大丰收，总产值还是完成了计划指标，并较1957年增加5％。对外贸易计划执行的特别出色。出口计划超额完成12％，进口计划超额完成2％。
    1958年匈牙利经济成就的一个主要特点，是依靠自己的力量达到了国民经济和国际收支的平衡。对外贸易方面出口计划的大大超额完成，扭转了长期以来贸易逆差的不利局面。这是匈牙利人民一项具有重大意义的胜利。
    工业生产的超计划增长带来了追加投资十五亿福林的成果。同时，1957年提高了的人民生活水平，不但得到了巩固而且继续有所提高。去年一年，居民储蓄存款增加了十亿福林，相当于反革命暴乱事件前一年居民储蓄存款的总和。这不仅标志着人民生活的提高，而且说明劳动人民对党和政府的极大信任和支持。
    所有这些成就的获得，是由于党和政府去年大力加强了对国民经济的领导，及时有效地解决了生产中各项问题的结果。如原料供应一直是匈牙利工业生产中的一个主要问题。基本原料80％依靠进口，每年进口中原料和半制成品占70％，不少工厂常常由于原料供应不上而停工待料，生产能力得不到充分利用。为了摆脱工业上的这种困难，减少原料进口，并提高产品的外销能力，去年年初党提出合理调整工业生产结构的政策。一方面提高基本原料和费工省料的产品的生产，另一方面降低或停止一部分费料多而外销困难的产品的生产。这一政策使基本原料生产部门和加工制造部门间长期存在的严重不平衡现象有了改变。而且由于高压设备、通讯器材、精密仪器、柴油机车、药材等制造部门的大量生产，有效地改善了对外贸易的出口情况。
    同时，为了改变原料供应的困难状况，使生产作到“又省又好”，政府还向全国职工提出了节约运动的号召。这一号召得到了工人群众的热烈支持。许多工厂提出了节约原料的保证。仅布达佩斯切佩尔钢铁联合企业去年一年就为国家节省了价值一亿福林的财产。此外，为了反对浪费国家财产的行为，在全国各地建立了人民监督员制度。两万四千名大公无私的人民监督员有效地执行着保卫国家财产的光荣任务。工厂委员会的建立、生产会议的恢复和加强，对扩大企业民主、启发职工的积极性和创造性，收到了很好的效果。职工们通过这种形式对生产的提高和技术的改进提供了许多有益的建议，对提高生产率和巩固劳动纪律起了直接的推动作用。
    一年来，匈牙利党在巩固和发展农业合作社方面也采取了许多措施。由于国家对合作社的正确领导和大力支持，合作社在去年一年中在政治、经济和组织上都得到了进一步的巩固，改善了生产经营，公共牲畜也增加了。去年合作社畜牧业的收益已超过农作物的收益。公共资金提高了。去年合作社每霍尔特的固定资金由1955年的二万三千福林增加到三万八千福林。每百霍尔特的产值也由1955年的三十六万福林增
  加到四十二万福林。去年合作社受到干旱的影响比个体农民小得多，谷物生产平均较个体农民高20％。这些情况有力地显示了合作社大规模经营的优越性。随着合作社的巩固，去年合作社在数量上也有所增加。新成立了四百个合作社，社有土地增加了二十五万霍尔特。
    今年新春伊始，匈牙利的合作化运动就随着春风飞跃发展起来。1月份以来，合作化运动首先在西部边境的吉厄尔—索普伦州迅速开展，而且进展愈来愈快，声势也愈来愈大，一天一个局面。进入2月，运动更以磅礴之势在全国许多地区掀起了空前未有的高潮，整乡整区入社，成批中农纷纷同个体经营方式告别，踏上集体生产的道路。迄至3月1日，合作社耕地面积激增一百万霍尔特。吉厄尔—索普伦和索尔诺克两州已全部合作化。维斯普雷姆、费叶尔、科马罗姆三个州也已超过半数或接近基本合作化。全国社会主义农业成分，按耕地面积计算已由1958年年底的26.5％（包括13％的国营农场）增加为40％以上。
    这一辉煌成就是两年来实行党的正确政策的果实。根据国内外形势，社会主义工人党在去年12月通过了加速合作化运动的决议。决议指出，合作化是当前全社会事业，号召一切社会力量、全党全民动手。同时决议根据农村特点，规定了一系列具体政策和措施。决议一经公布，立即在各地党员积极分子大会上展开热烈的讨论，很快地掌握了干部的思想，发出巨大的威力。吉厄尔—索普伦州在这次运动中一马当先，起了促进作用。该州在州党委的领导下，在12月决议的基础上批判了不正确的观点，统一了干部的认识，并根据当地的具体条件和特点发挥了首创精神，调动了一切积极因素，采取了灵活的方式方法，深入群众，夜以继日地进行耐心的宣传组织工作。在运动发展的过程中，中央也及时地总结了吉厄尔—索普伦州的成功经验加以推广。
    在合作化运动中打了大胜仗的农民，志气昂扬，热情洋溢。他们一面整顿了自己的队伍，从政治组织上来巩固合作社，一面毫不停留地又在生产战线上摆开了阵势，迎接春耕春播的战役。
    合作化的迅速发展也推动了工业部门，特别是和农业有关的工业部门的生产。具有光荣革命传统的匈牙利工人阶级，在合作化宣传组织工作中作出了重大贡献，以后又在促进合作社生产中伸出了支援之手。农机农药等厂的工人们，在党的号召下纷纷集会讨论如何提前和超额完成生产计划，来支援合作社农民兄弟。捷报一个接着一个传来。埃莫格农具机械厂职工保证超计划生产五十台收割联合机来支援合作社。运输设备工厂职工要在收割以前超计划赶制二百台饲料收割机送到农村。红星拖拉机厂职工更提出超额生产一百五十台拖拉机和价值二百万福林的配件的保证。久尔机床厂保证除超额完成生产任务外，还组织义务劳动队，利用假日为临近的合作社修建畜圈。该厂厂长、党委书记、工会主席也同工人一起参加义务劳动。
    就在这个时候，党中央于3月6日举行了全会，深入分析了国际有利形势，充分估计了国内的有利条件，向全国人民提出争取两年完成三年计划主要指标的豪迈号召；为此要求今年工业生产指标超额完成4％，农业生产要超额完成原定增产5.2％的生产计划，要保证今年一百三十二亿福林投资计划的执行，工业生产成本要由原定降低1.5％的计划改为2.5％，劳动生产率要由原定提高3％的计划改为5％，国民收入要求提高8.3％，职工实际工资要提高5％到6％。为了保证这一伟大任务的完成，号召各企业组织社会主义劳动竞赛。
    匈牙利工人党这一振奋人心的战斗号召，正在形成鼓舞匈牙利人民奋勇前进的巨大动力。许多工厂纷纷响应党的号召，提出具体保证。愈来愈多的工人组成社会主义劳动队，互相挑战。最近布达佩斯市党委会根据中央决议号召布达佩斯全体职工起带头作用，为迎接年底即将召开的党代表大会广泛开展社会主义劳动竞赛“更好、更快、更省”地完成生产任务。一个大规模的轰轰烈烈的社会主义竞赛运动即将在全国范围内展开。
  勤劳英勇的匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党的领导下，为了更美好更幸福的明天，正信心百倍地乘胜前进。
