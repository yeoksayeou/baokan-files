Never Allow Interference in China's Internal Affairs
To the Editor:
    Indian expansionists are using the Tibetan rebellion to interfere in our internal affairs, attempting to undermine our national unity and realize their expansionist ambitions. This is becoming increasingly rampant and obvious. What is particularly intolerable is that on April 20th, with the connivance of the Indian police authorities, a small group of Praja Socialist Party members in Bombay openly insulted the image of our beloved leader Chairman Mao in front of our consulate. We express our utmost indignation at this.
    We have noticed that the recent slanderous remarks and actions taken by Indian expansionists regarding the Tibetan rebellion are coming from certain leaders within the ruling party and official authorities in India. This fully demonstrates that some Indian government officials, disregarding the friendship between China and India, are deliberately undermining the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly recognized by both countries, in order to interfere in our internal affairs and undermine our national unity. It should be solemnly pointed out that Tibet is Chinese territory, and suppressing the rebellion in Tibet is China's internal affair. Except for a small handful of reactionary rebels, the Tibetan people wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. Anyone who attempts to stir up trouble using the Tibetan rebellion, hoping to fish in troubled waters, will inevitably end up with a bloody nose and a disgraceful defeat. We firmly oppose anyone interfering in China's internal affairs, and we will never tolerate anyone's unwarranted slanders and insults against our country. We demand that the Indian government authorities take effective measures immediately to stop all conspiracies to interfere in China's internal affairs and to stop all actions that insult the leaders of the Chinese people. We greatly cherish the friendship between China and India, but if Indian expansionists do not stop their increasingly rampant words and deeds and continue to engage in activities aimed at splitting China, the entire Chinese people know exactly how to deal with it, and all the adverse consequences of the development of the situation should be borne entirely by Indian expansionists.

We Cheer the Victory of the People's Liberation Army in Quelling the Tibetan Rebels
To the Editor:
    The former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata, colluding with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and openly launched an armed rebellion. We, the entire staff of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Office in Beijing, express our utmost indignation at this heinous crime of betraying the motherland and the interests of the Tibetan people.
    Recently, Indian expansionists have more clearly exposed their interventionist ambitions, daring to collude with the rebels and fabricating lies such as the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" and "Tibetan independence." These fallacies have been refuted completely by the Xinhua News Agency political reporter and righteous people at home and abroad with ironclad facts.
    We solemnly warn the imperialists and Indian expansionists not to be blind to the situation. The days when you could ride roughshod over the Chinese people are long gone, and the dark age when the Tibetan people were enslaved and exploited will never return. You should rein in your horses before it's too late, or you will inevitably end up with a bloody nose.
    The Tibet Military Region troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, ordered to suppress the rebels, have achieved new and greater victories in the battle to quell the rebels in Shannan, Tibet, after quelling the rebellion in the Lhasa area. This is the deserved punishment for the rebels and a ruthless blow to the reactionaries.
    We would like to express our heartfelt respect to the heroic troops stationed in Tibet! And extend our brotherly greetings to the Tibetan people who assisted the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion!
    All Personnel of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Office in Beijing

The True Colors are Now Clear to the World!
To the Editor:
    I feel very indignant when I see in the newspaper that officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs are distributing the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement."
    Here, I would like to say a few words to some Indian "politicians" who are "enthusiastic" in discussing the Tibet issue.
    First, you keep saying that "Tibetans are not Han Chinese," implying that the actions of the Tibetan traitorous group are excusable! However, your country is also a multi-ethnic country. Suppose a few upper-class members of one of your ethnic minorities betrayed your central government and engaged in sinful activities to split your country, would you also consider it excusable?
    In the past, British imperialism long used the complex situation of race and religion in India to implement the vicious policy of "divide and rule" in India, hindering the Indian people from uniting to fight, which caused the Indian people to suffer exploitation and oppression for two or three hundred years. We Chinese have an old saying: "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you." Now you are helping, sympathizing with, and supporting a small number of national scum in China, and interfering in our internal affairs. This is truly a case of forgetting the pain once the wound has healed! We believe that the multi-ethnic Indian people and the peace-loving Indian people will not allow these expansionists to be so unscrupulous!
    Second, the Indian expansionists keep clamoring about "caring" about the Tibetan people.
    If that is really the case, you should not have any sympathy for the Tibetan rebel group.
    What exactly did this small group of traitors do in Tibet? You should also understand that they are the bloodsuckers of the Tibetan people, and they implement and insist on permanently implementing the cruel serf system.
    They are extremely barbaric autocratic demons, who inflict cruel tortures such as gouging out eyes, pulling out hearts, skinning, and drawing tendons on the people. Anyone who sympathizes with the people should deeply hate them. If you actually feel sympathy for this small group of cannibalistic demons, and even extend a hand of sympathy, then your true colors cannot be concealed in any way!
    I think the Indian expansionists should now understand that there is fair public opinion in the world and history is merciless. You should turn back as soon as possible.

Expose the Lies of the Rebel Elements
To the Editor:
    After reading the so-called Dalai Lama's statement, which is full of loopholes, as a Tibetan compatriot, I have a responsibility to expose the lies of the rebel elements.
    The Central People's Government and the troops stationed in Tibet have always abided by the Seventeen-Article Agreement, respected the customs and religious beliefs of the Tibetan people, and during the Chuanzhao Festival (i.e., the Dalai Lama's scripture-speaking festival, which lasts for more than ten days in February and March of the Tibetan calendar), the central government also gave alms to poor lamas. After liberation, the Ula (corv√©e labor) was abolished, fair trade was implemented, poor children who could not study at all in the past entered schools and enjoyed scholarships; previously, Tibetans could only wait for death when they had serious illnesses, but now free medical care is implemented. In order to help the Tibetan people develop production and improve their lives, the People's Government has issued a large amount of interest-free loans. In 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established, and the Tibetan people were overjoyed. Many regions sent representatives to visit the Dalai Lama and requested to change the unreasonable social system. At the Preparatory Committee meeting, the members unanimously agreed to the representatives' request. However, the reactionary elements repeatedly obstructed the social reform in Tibet. The reactionary elements' criminal activities of opposing communism and progress started long before the liberation. In 1950, they murdered Geda Living Buddha, who advocated the peaceful liberation of Tibet.
    The Tibetan people deeply understand who are benefactors and who are enemies. Tibet is a part of China and a member of the national family. Leaving the motherland, it will fall into the abyss of darkness. We will always believe that with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it is the greatest happiness of the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups. The Tibetan people will never allow any activities that split the motherland, and a socialist new Tibet will grow rapidly in the family of the motherland.
    Yixi Langjie, Tibetan Student of Hubei Provincial Finance and Economics Cadre School

Interventionists Can Only End in Failure
To the Editor:
    After seeing the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" distributed by officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs and the slanders of Indian expansionists against our country in the newspaper, the cadres and members of the Chengguan Brigade of our Changli Fruit Township People's Commune felt extremely angry. Tibet has been our territory since ancient times, and the Han, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups in our country are all members of the motherland's family. Some foreigners want to undermine our unity and split Tibet, which we will never allow! The Indian expansionists fabricated and distributed the so-called Dalai Lama's statement, wanting to prevent the Dalai Lama from returning to the motherland, and advocating "independence" for Tibet. It is obvious that they are deliberately trying to turn Tibet into a colony and "protectorate" of imperialism. The Indian expansionists should be clear-headed and not think that China is weak and can be bullied. The Chinese people know how to deal with interventionists. Any interventionist can only end in failure.

Resolutely Counter Foreign Interventionists
To the Editor:
    We were very indignant when we saw the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" published in the newspaper. The imperialists and Indian expansionists are openly supporting the Tibetan rebels, and their conspiracy to separate our national unity and undermine our unity is a futile attempt. Tibet is a part of our territory and is sacred and inviolable. Since liberation, our Central People's Government has adopted a tolerant attitude on the Tibet issue, earnestly implementing the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and has always respected the living habits and religious beliefs of the vast Tibetan people. In order to build Tibet as prosperous and strong as the mainland, great efforts have been made in recent years. However, the reactionary upper strata in Tibet violated the will of the Tibetan people, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and launched an armed rebellion. Suppressing the rebellion and safeguarding the unity of the motherland are our country's own affairs. What reason do Indian expansionists have to interfere with us! We resolutely oppose the imperialists and Indian expansionists undermining the unity of our nationalities and the friendly relations between China and India, and foreign interventionists must be resolutely countered.

China's Territory Cannot be Divided
To the Editor:
    When we saw the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," we were very angry. This "statement" very nakedly proves that the imperialists and Indian expansionists are trying to split our country under the guise of the Dalai Lama. And groundlessly saying that Tibet is an independent country. Tibet is an inseparable part of China, which no one can deny. As early as the 13th century, the Tibetan region officially joined China's territory. No country in the world has ever considered Tibet an independent country or had diplomatic relations with Tibet. The diplomatic officials of the Indian government distributed such a "statement" that talks about Tibet's "independence," indicating that some expansionist elements in India simply have a heated head. Wake up! The era of bullying China is gone forever. The speeches of the representatives at the National People's Congress meeting represent the wishes of our 650 million people, and this is the voice of justice of 650 million people. The expansionist elements and all reactionaries must understand that the Tibet issue is China's internal affair, and no one is allowed to interfere in our internal affairs and slander our great motherland.

The Indian Expansionists' Calculation is Wrong
To the Editor:
    It is infuriating to see the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" distributed by Indian government diplomatic officials published in the newspaper. The so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" is full of fabricated lies between the lines. The eyes of the Chinese people are discerning, and lies cannot deceive people. This "statement" was issued under the circumstances that the Dalai Lama was kidnapped, and the tone is not that of the Dalai Lama. Therefore, we have reason to suspect that this was imposed on him by others. The Indian government's diplomatic officials' distribution of this so-called "statement" is obviously with ulterior motives and is not in line with the interests of the Five Principles advocated by China and India.
    The calculations of the imperialists and Indian expansionists have all gone wrong. Your conspiracies and tricks will not get any other results, but will only arouse the hatred of hundreds of millions of people towards you.

They solemnly warned Indian expansionists: Their conspiracy to use the Tibetan rebellion to realize their expansionist ambitions will never succeed.
