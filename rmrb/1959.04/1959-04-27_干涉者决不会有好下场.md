Never Allow Interference in China's Internal Affairs
To the Editor:
    Indian expansionists are using the Tibetan rebellion to interfere in our internal affairs, attempting to undermine our national unity and realize their expansionist ambitions. This is becoming increasingly rampant and obvious. What is particularly intolerable is that on April 20th, with the connivance of the Indian police authorities, a small group of Praja Socialist Party members in Bombay openly insulted the image of our beloved leader Chairman Mao in front of our consulate. We express our utmost indignation at this.
    We have noticed that the recent slanderous remarks and actions taken by Indian expansionists regarding the Tibetan rebellion are coming from certain leaders within the ruling party and official authorities in India. This fully demonstrates that some Indian government officials, disregarding the friendship between China and India, are deliberately undermining the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly recognized by both countries, in order to interfere in our internal affairs and undermine our national unity. It should be solemnly pointed out that Tibet is Chinese territory, and suppressing the rebellion in Tibet is China's internal affair. Except for a small handful of reactionary rebels, the Tibetan people wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. Anyone who attempts to stir up trouble using the Tibetan rebellion, hoping to fish in troubled waters, will inevitably end up with a bloody nose and a disgraceful defeat. We firmly oppose anyone interfering in China's internal affairs, and we will never tolerate anyone's unwarranted slanders and insults against our country. We demand that the Indian government authorities take effective measures immediately to stop all conspiracies to interfere in China's internal affairs and to stop all actions that insult the leaders of the Chinese people. We greatly cherish the friendship between China and India, but if Indian expansionists do not stop their increasingly rampant words and deeds and continue to engage in activities aimed at splitting China, the entire Chinese people know exactly how to deal with it, and all the adverse consequences of the development of the situation should be borne entirely by Indian expansionists.

We Cheer the Victory of the People's Liberation Army in Quelling the Tibetan Rebels
To the Editor:
    The former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata, colluding with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and openly launched an armed rebellion. We, the entire staff of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Office in Beijing, express our utmost indignation at this heinous crime of betraying the motherland and the interests of the Tibetan people.
    Recently, Indian expansionists have more clearly exposed their interventionist ambitions, daring to collude with the rebels and fabricating lies such as the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" and "Tibetan independence." These fallacies have been refuted completely by the Xinhua News Agency political reporter and righteous people at home and abroad with ironclad facts.
    We solemnly warn the imperialists and Indian expansionists not to be blind to the situation. The days when you could ride roughshod over the Chinese people are long gone, and the dark age when the Tibetan people were enslaved and exploited will never return. You should rein in your horses before it's too late, or you will inevitably end up with a bloody nose.
    The Tibet Military Region troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, ordered to suppress the rebels, have achieved new and greater victories in the battle to quell the rebels in Shannan, Tibet, after quelling the rebellion in the Lhasa area. This is the deserved punishment for the rebels and a ruthless blow to the reactionaries.
    We would like to express our heartfelt respect to the heroic troops stationed in Tibet! And extend our brotherly greetings to the Tibetan people who assisted the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion!
    All Personnel of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Office in Beijing

The True Colors are Now Clear to the World!
To the Editor:
    I feel very indignant when I see in the newspaper that officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs are distributing the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement."
    Here, I would like to say a few words to some Indian "politicians" who are "enthusiastic" in discussing the Tibet issue.
    First, you keep saying that "Tibetans are not Han Chinese," implying that the actions of the Tibetan traitorous group are excusable! However, your country is also a multi-ethnic country. Suppose a few upper-class members of one of your ethnic minorities betrayed your central government and engaged in sinful activities to split your country, would you also consider it excusable?
    In the past, British imperialism long used the complex situation of race and religion in India to implement the vicious policy of "divide and rule" in India, hindering the Indian people from uniting to fight, which caused the Indian people to suffer exploitation and oppression for two or three hundred years. We Chinese have an old saying: "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you." Now you are helping, sympathizing with, and supporting a small number of national scum in China, and interfering in our internal affairs. This is truly a case of forgetting the pain once the wound has healed! We believe that the multi-ethnic Indian people and the peace-loving Indian people will not allow these expansionists to be so unscrupulous!
    Second, the Indian expansionists keep clamoring about "caring" about the Tibetan people.
    If that is really the case, you should not have any sympathy for the Tibetan rebel group.
    What exactly did this small group of traitors do in Tibet? You should also understand that they are the bloodsuckers of the Tibetan people, and they implement and insist on permanently implementing the cruel serf system.
    They are extremely barbaric autocratic demons, who inflict cruel tortures such as gouging out eyes, pulling out hearts, skinning, and drawing tendons on the people. Anyone who sympathizes with the people should deeply hate them. If you actually feel sympathy for this small group of cannibalistic demons, and even extend a hand of sympathy, then your true colors cannot be concealed in any way!
    I think the Indian expansionists should now understand that there is fair public opinion in the world and history is merciless. You should turn back as soon as possible.
         Tang Yirong, Teacher of Chongqing Normal College

Expose the Lies of the Rebel Elements
To the Editor:
    After reading the so-called Dalai Lama's statement, which is full of loopholes, as a Tibetan compatriot, I have a responsibility to expose the lies of the rebel elements.
    The Central People's Government and the troops stationed in Tibet have always abided by the Seventeen-Article Agreement, respected the customs and religious beliefs of the Tibetan people, and during the Chuanzhao Festival (i.e., the Dalai Lama's scripture-speaking festival, which lasts for more than ten days in February and March of the Tibetan calendar), the central government also gave alms to poor lamas. After liberation, the Ula (corvée labor) was abolished, fair trade was implemented, poor children who could not study at all in the past entered schools and enjoyed scholarships; previously, Tibetans could only wait for death when they had serious illnesses, but now free medical care is implemented. In order to help the Tibetan people develop production and improve their lives, the People's Government has issued a large amount of interest-free loans. In 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established, and the Tibetan people were overjoyed. Many regions sent representatives to visit the Dalai Lama and requested to change the unreasonable social system. At the Preparatory Committee meeting, the members unanimously agreed to the representatives' request. However, the reactionary elements repeatedly obstructed the social reform in Tibet. The reactionary elements' criminal activities of opposing communism and progress started long before the liberation. In 1950, they murdered Geda Living Buddha, who advocated the peaceful liberation of Tibet.
    The Tibetan people deeply understand who are benefactors and who are enemies. Tibet is a part of China and a member of the national family. Leaving the motherland, it will fall into the abyss of darkness. We will always believe that with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it is the greatest happiness of the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups. The Tibetan people will never allow any activities that split the motherland, and a socialist new Tibet will grow rapidly in the family of the motherland.

Interventionists Can Only End in Failure
To the Editor:
    After seeing the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" distributed by officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs and the slanders of Indian expansionists against our country in the newspaper, the cadres and members of the Chengguan Brigade of our Changli Fruit Township People's Commune felt extremely angry. Tibet has been our territory since ancient times, and the Han, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups in our country are all members of the motherland's family. Some foreigners want to undermine our unity and split Tibet, which we will never allow! The Indian expansionists fabricated and distributed the so-called Dalai Lama's statement, wanting to prevent the Dalai Lama from returning to the motherland, and advocating "independence" for Tibet. It is obvious that they are deliberately trying to turn Tibet into a colony and "protectorate" of imperialism. The Indian expansionists should be clear-headed and not think that China is weak and can be bullied. The Chinese people know how to deal with interventionists. Any interventionist can only end in failure.

Resolutely Counter Foreign Interventionists
To the Editor:
    We were very indignant when we saw the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" published in the newspaper. The imperialists and Indian expansionists are openly supporting the Tibetan rebels, and their conspiracy to separate our national unity and undermine our unity is a futile attempt. Tibet is a part of our territory and is sacred and inviolable. Since liberation, our Central People's Government has adopted a tolerant attitude on the Tibet issue, earnestly implementing the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and has always respected the living habits and religious beliefs of the vast Tibetan people. In order to build Tibet as prosperous and strong as the mainland, great efforts have been made in recent years. However, the reactionary upper strata in Tibet violated the will of the Tibetan people, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and launched an armed rebellion. Suppressing the rebellion and safeguarding the unity of the motherland are our country's own affairs. What reason do Indian expansionists have to interfere with us! We resolutely oppose the imperialists and Indian expansionists undermining the unity of our nationalities and the friendly relations between China and India, and foreign interventionists must be resolutely countered.

China's Territory Cannot be Divided
To the Editor:
    When we saw the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," we were very angry. This "statement" very nakedly proves that the imperialists and Indian expansionists are trying to split our country under the guise of the Dalai Lama. And groundlessly saying that Tibet is an independent country. Tibet is an inseparable part of China, which no one can deny. As early as the 13th century, the Tibetan region officially joined China's territory. No country in the world has ever considered Tibet an independent country or had diplomatic relations with Tibet. The diplomatic officials of the Indian government distributed such a "statement" that talks about Tibet's "independence," indicating that some expansionist elements in India simply have a heated head. Wake up! The era of bullying China is gone forever. The speeches of the representatives at the National People's Congress meeting represent the wishes of our 650 million people, and this is the voice of justice of 650 million people. The expansionist elements and all reactionaries must understand that the Tibet issue is China's internal affair, and no one is allowed to interfere in our internal affairs and slander our great motherland.

The Indian Expansionists' Calculation is Wrong
To the Editor:
    It is infuriating to see the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" distributed by Indian government diplomatic officials published in the newspaper. The so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" is full of fabricated lies between the lines. The eyes of the Chinese people are discerning, and lies cannot deceive people. This "statement" was issued under the circumstances that the Dalai Lama was kidnapped, and the tone is not that of the Dalai Lama. Therefore, we have reason to suspect that this was imposed on him by others. The Indian government's diplomatic officials' distribution of this so-called "statement" is obviously with ulterior motives and is not in line with the interests of the Five Principles advocated by China and India.
    The calculations of the imperialists and Indian expansionists have all gone wrong. Your conspiracies and tricks will not get any other results, but will only arouse the hatred of hundreds of millions of people towards you.

    干涉者决不会有好下场
    决不容许干涉中国内政编辑同志：
    印度扩张主义分子利用西藏叛乱事件干涉我国内政，企图破坏我国统一，实行扩张的野心，越来越猖狂，越来越明显。尤其令人不能容忍的是4月20日在印度警察当局纵容之下，一小撮人民社会党人在孟买我领事馆门前公然侮辱我国人民敬爱的领袖毛主席像。对此，我们表示万分愤慨。
    我们注意到，最近印度扩张主义分子对西藏叛乱事件所发表的诬蔑我国的言论和所采取的行动，是出自印度执政党和官方当局的某些领导人物。这就充分证明印度一些政府人士不顾中印两国之间的友谊，蓄意破坏两国共同承认的和平共处五项原则，以求达到干涉我国内政，破坏我国统一的目的。应该严正指出，西藏是中国的领土，戡平西藏的叛乱，是中国的内政问题。除了一小撮反动的叛乱分子之外，西藏人民都是竭诚拥护中国共产党和中央人民政府的。任何人想利用西藏叛乱事件兴风作浪，幻想混水摸鱼，到头来必然会碰得头破血流，一定遭到可耻的失败。我们坚决反对任何人干涉中国内政，也决不容忍任何人对我国的无端诬蔑和污辱。我们要求印度政府当局迅速采取有效措施，停止一切干涉中国内政的阴谋活动，制止一切侮辱中国人民领袖的行动。我们十分珍视中印两国之间的友谊，但是如果印度扩张主义分子不停止日益嚣张的言行，仍继续进行分裂中国的活动的话，全中国的人民完全知道应该如何对付，形势发展的一切不良后果，应该由印度扩张主义分子全部承担。
    中央财政金融干部学校全体人员
    我们欢呼解放军平定西藏叛匪的胜利编辑同志：
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，劫持达赖喇嘛，撕毁关于和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，公然发动了武装叛乱；对这种背叛祖国、背叛西藏人民利益的滔天罪行，我们内蒙古自治区驻京办事处全体工作人员表示万分的愤慨。
    最近以来，印度扩张主义分子更明显地暴露了干涉者的野心，竟胆敢与叛匪勾结，捏造所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”和所谓“西藏独立”等谎言。这些谬论已被新华社政治记者和中外正义人士用铁的事实驳斥得体无完肤。
    我们严正警告帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子，你们不要有眼不识泰山，你们骑在中国人民头上的日子早已过去了，我国西藏人民被奴役受剥削的黑暗时代也一去不复返了，你们趁早悬崖勒马，否则你们必将碰得头破血流。
    奉命讨伐叛匪的中国人民解放军西藏军区部队，在平定了拉萨地区叛乱后，又在讨平西藏山南叛匪的战斗中取得了新的更大的胜利。这是给叛匪的应得惩罚，这是给反动派的无情打击。
    我们谨向英勇作战的驻藏部队表示衷心的敬意！并向协助解放军
    平定叛乱的西藏人民致以兄弟般的慰问！
    内蒙古自治区驻京办事处全体工作人员
    真面目已经大明于天下了！编辑同志：
    看到报上登载印度外交部的官员竟然散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，我感到很愤慨。
    这里，我想对于印度的一些“热心”于谈论西藏事件的“政治家”谈几句话。
    第一，你们一再说什么“西藏人不是汉人”，言外之意，似乎西藏叛国集团的行动还情有可原！但是，你们的国家也是多民族国家，试问，要是你们的某个少数民族的少数上层人物，背叛了你们的中央政府，从事分裂你们的国家的罪恶活动，是否你们也认为情有可原呢？
    过去，英帝国主义长期利用印度种族、宗教的复杂情况，对印度实行“分而治之”的毒辣政策，阻碍了印度人民团结起来进行斗争，曾经使印度人民在两三百年中受尽了剥削和压榨。我们中国有句古话说得好：“己所不欲，勿施于人”。现在你们竟然帮助、同情、支持我们中国的一小撮民族败类，对我国内政进行干涉。这真是好了疮疤，忘了痛！我们相信多民族的印度人民，爱好和平的印度人民，不会允许这些扩张主义分子这样横行无忌的！
    第二，印度的扩张主义分子一再叫嚷说什么“关心”西藏人民。
    如果真的是这样，你们就无论如何不应该对西藏叛乱集团有半点同情。
    试问，这一小撮叛国分子在西藏干了些什么勾当？你们也该明白：他们是西藏人民的吸血鬼，他们实行并坚持要永远实行残酷的农奴制。
    他们是野蛮已极的专制魔王，对人民实行惨绝人寰的挖眼，扒心，剥皮，抽筋等毒刑。任何同情人民的人都应该对他们深恶痛绝。你们如果竟然对这一小撮吃人魔王产生了同情，甚至伸出同情的手，那么，你们的真面目就无论如何也掩盖不住了！
    我认为，印度扩张主义分子现在该明白了，世界有公正舆论，历史是无情的。你们应该及早回头。

     戳穿叛乱分子的谎言编辑同志：
    看了漏洞百出的所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，作为一个藏族同胞，我有责任戳穿叛乱分子的谎言。
    中央人民政府和驻藏部队一向遵守十七条协议、尊重西藏人民的风俗习惯和宗教信仰，在传昭节（即达赖喇嘛讲经的节日，在藏历二、三月份，共十余天时间）期间，中央对贫困喇嘛还进行布施。解放后，派乌拉（抓丁抓夫）没有了，实行了公平交易，过去根本不能读书的穷孩子进了学校，享受助学金；以前藏民有了大病只有等死，现在实行了免费医疗。人民政府为了帮助西藏人民发展生产提高生活，发放了大量的无息贷款，1956年西藏自治区筹备委员会成立，西藏人民欢欣鼓舞，很多地区派代表拜见达赖，要求改变不合理的社会制度。筹委会上，委员们一致同意代表们的要求。但反动分子却一再阻挠西藏的社会改革。反动分子反共反进步的罪恶活动远在解放前就开始了，1950年他们就杀害了主张和平解放西藏的格达活佛。
    西藏人民深深懂得谁是恩人，谁是敌人。西藏是中国的一部分，是民族大家庭的一员，离开了祖国，它就会陷入黑暗的深渊。我们永远相信，有中国共产党的领导，是我们西藏人民、也是各族人民最大的幸福。西藏人民决不允许任何分裂祖国的勾当，社会主义的新西藏将在祖国的大家庭中迅速成长。

    干涉者只能以失败告终编辑同志：
    我们昌黎果乡人民公社城关大队的干部和社员们，在报纸上看到由印度外交部官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，和印度扩张主义分子对我国的污蔑以后，大家感到万分的愤怒。西藏很早以来就是我国的领土，汉族、藏族以及我国的其他民族，都是祖国大家庭中的一员，一些外国人竟想破坏我们的团结，把西藏分裂出去，我们决不允许！印度扩张主义分子制造并散发了达赖喇嘛的所谓声明，想杜绝达赖喇嘛回到祖国的路，鼓吹什么西藏“独立”，显而易见是蓄意把西藏变成帝国主义的殖民地和“保护国”。印度扩张主义分子的头脑应该清醒些，不要以为中国软弱可欺，中国人民是知道怎样对付干涉者的。任何干涉者都只能以失败告终。
    昌黎果乡人民公社城关大队干部和社员
    坚决反击外国干涉者编辑同志：
    我们看了报上发表的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”感到万分愤慨。帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子公开支持西藏叛乱分子，妄想分离我国民族团结、破坏我国统一的阴谋，是枉费心机。西藏是我国领土的一部分，是神圣不可侵犯的，解放以来，我国中央人民政府在西藏问题上处处采取宽容态度，认真执行和平解放西藏办法十七条协议，一向尊重广大藏民的生活习惯和宗教信仰，为了把西藏建设得和内地一样繁荣富强，几年来尽了很大的努力。但西藏上层反动集团违背了西藏人民的意志，劫持了达赖喇嘛进行武装叛乱。平息叛乱，维护祖国统一，是我们国家自己的事情，印度扩张主义分子有什么理由来干涉我们！我们坚决反对帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子破坏我国各民族的团结和中印友好关系，必须给外国干涉者以坚决的反击。

    中国的版图不容分割编辑同志：
    当我们看到所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”时，非常气愤。这个“声明”非常露骨地证明帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子在假借达赖喇嘛的名义，企图分裂我国。并无中生有的说西藏是独立国。西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，这是任何人都不能加以否认的。远在十三世纪的时候，西藏地方就正式加入了中国的版图。世界上也从来没有哪一个国家认为西藏是个独立国家，同西藏发生外交关系。印度政府的外交官员散发了这样一个大谈所谓西藏“独立”的“声明”，表明了印度的一些扩张主义分子简直是头脑发热了。醒醒吧！欺侮中国的时代已经一去不复返了。全国人民代表大会会议上代表们的发言，代表了我们六亿五千万人民的意愿，这是六亿五千万人民的正义声音。扩张主义分子和一切反动派要放明白些，西藏问题是中国的内政问题，不允许任何人干涉我国内政，和诽谤我们伟大的祖国。

    印度扩张主义者的算盘打错了编辑同志：
    看到报纸上登载的印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，令人气愤难忍。所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，字里行间充满了捏造的谎话。中国人民的眼睛是雪亮的，谎话是骗不了人的。这个“声明”是在达赖喇嘛被劫持的情况下发表的，而且里边又不是达赖喇嘛的口气，因此，我们有理由怀疑这是别人强加于他的。印度政府外交官员散发这个所谓“声明”，显然是别有用心的，是不符合中印两国所倡导的五项原则利益的。
    帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的算盘都打错了。你们的阴谋诡计，不会得到什么别的结果，只能引起亿万人民对你们的愤恨。
