I listened with immense excitement to Premier Zhou Enlai’s “Government Work Report,” Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s “Report on the Draft of the 1959 National Economic Plan,” Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s “Report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft,” and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen’s “Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.” These deeply educated me in socialism and greatly encouraged me. I fully endorse these reports.

Our country successfully completed its First Five-Year Plan, establishing a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. In 1958, China experienced an unprecedented leap forward in its national economy. Tremendous leaps were made in industry, agriculture, transportation, postal services, commerce, and cultural education. During the Great Leap Forward, a new form of social organization – the People's Commune – rose like the morning sun and became widespread throughout the vast countryside. These glorious achievements are the result of the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the diligent implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction by the people of the entire nation, and their heroic labor. They are also inseparable from the selfless assistance of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union. This has inspired the people of the whole country to become even more invigorated, and with a bold spirit of riding the wind and waves, achieve an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

Personal Experiences over the Past Decade Have Shown the Party’s Concern for Industrialists and Businessmen, and the Correctness and Greatness of the Transformation Policy

In the face of the great leap forward in the construction of the motherland, every patriotic industrialist and businessman must not remain indifferent. Since liberation, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have adopted a policy of peaceful transformation towards us industrialists and businessmen, based on China’s specific conditions and historical circumstances. The aim is to transform private industrial and commercial enterprises into socialist enterprises, that is, enterprises owned by the whole people, and to transform bourgeois elements into working people. After joint state-private ownership, the transformation of enterprises has been basically completed, but in terms of the transformation of people, it is still necessary to continue to carry out a fundamental transformation of standpoint and thought. My personal experience over the past decade has deeply shown the correctness and greatness of the policy of peaceful transformation. In order to enable us industrialists and businessmen to gradually transform ourselves from exploiters into working people through self-transformation, the Party has consistently adopted a gentle and persuasive approach, offering patient and earnest teachings. It has not only given special consideration to our work, study, labor, and life, but has also encouraged our slightest achievements. Through self-transformation, what we industrialists and businessmen have discarded are only those dirty and foul things of capitalism, and what we have gained is a bright socialist future. Therefore, it is a good and glorious thing for us industrialists and businessmen to accept socialist transformation.

In his Government Work Report, Premier Zhou pointed out again: “For capitalists, the state will pay fixed interest according to the original schedule and will actively help them continue to conduct self-education and self-transformation in their participation in socialist construction.” This makes me even more aware that the Party and the People’s Government’s care and consideration for us industrialists and businessmen are meticulous. So, in the great leap forward of the motherland’s economic construction, how should we industrialists and businessmen strengthen transformation, actively serve, make contributions, and play a role?

The Dual Nature of Most People in Industrial and Commercial Circles Still Exists, and the Problem of the Struggle Between the Two Roads Has Not Been Resolved; Transformation Is Not Almost Complete, but Is Still Far From It

Over the past year or so, we industrialists and businessmen in Beijing have undergone an extremely profound education and training in “destroying capitalism and establishing socialism” through the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement. Most people have made progress in politics and ideology to varying degrees, raised their awareness, distinguished right from wrong, and recognized that they must accept the leadership of the Communist Party and take the socialist road. Many have participated in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various labor training activities under the leadership of the working people in enterprises and other work posts, making certain contributions to the cause of socialist construction. However, measured by the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao, the dual nature of most people in our industrial and commercial circles still exists, and the problem of the struggle between the two roads has not been resolved. Transformation is not almost complete, but is still far from it. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen the fundamental transformation of political standpoint and thought.

The transformation of us industrialists and businessmen is a fundamental transformation that involves “reborn.” Because we have the leadership of the Party, the supervision of the working masses, and the driving force of the great leap forward in socialist construction, our transformation conditions are very favorable. As long as we make active efforts subjectively, we can transform ourselves well. Of course, the transformation of class standpoint and thought is long-term, tortuous, and complex. Although the objective conditions are so favorable to us, whether each of us transforms well or badly mainly depends on how each of us works hard subjectively. Through the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, most of us in industrial and commercial circles have made progress in political thought to varying degrees, but this progress is sometimes fast and sometimes slow, sometimes forward and sometimes backward, advancing with reversals and advancing in reversals. Therefore, I believe that we industrialists and businessmen can only keep up with the development of the great situation by strengthening the fundamental transformation of political standpoint and thought and actively serving socialist construction.

Chairman Mao taught us: “The thorough transformation of industrialists and businessmen must be in the course of work. They should labor together with the workers in enterprises, taking the enterprise as a base for self-transformation, but it is also important to change some of their old views through study.” This instruction from Chairman Mao is the path that we industrialists and businessmen must follow. Therefore, the transformation of us industrialists and businessmen must resolutely implement the policy of taking political and ideological transformation as the commander, taking labor and practice as the foundation, taking enterprises or work posts as the base, and combining the three, which is to strengthen transformation and actively participate in socialist construction, and transform ourselves in practice. Therefore, we must often measure and spur ourselves with the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao. We must loyally accept the leadership of the Party and the supervision of the working masses. We must strengthen the study of political theory, especially the study of Chairman Mao's works, and actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy in our city, offering skills, suggestions, and contributing our strength.

The Tibetan Rebellion is Self-destruction by the Tibetan Reactionary Group, Which Instead Creates Favorable Conditions for the Democratization of Tibet and the Construction of a New Tibet

While we are actively building socialism, imperialism and all reactionaries will not be reconciled. They are constantly and painstakingly trying to undermine our glorious achievements. We must be vigilant. The recent collusion between the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet and imperialism to abduct the Dalai Lama and betray the motherland, and to gather bandits to launch an armed rebellion to undermine national unity and undermine national unity, is an ironclad proof. We industrialists and businessmen resolutely support the State Council's decision to dissolve the Tibetan local government, order the People's Liberation Army to completely quell the rebellion, and all the measures taken. The rebellion of this small group of reactionary elements completely violates the interests of the Tibetan people and the common interests of all ethnic groups in the country, so it is bound to suffer a complete defeat. In fact, with the active assistance of patriotic monks and laypeople in Tibet, the People's Liberation Army has put down this rebellion. The self-destruction of the Tibetan reactionaries has actually created extremely favorable conditions for the democratization of Tibet and the construction of a new Tibet. We are happy to see that the Tibetan people will gradually get rid of their dark lives of poverty and backwardness and embark on a bright road of prosperity and progress.

Now a small group of Tibetan traitors who have fled to India are further colluding with British imperialism and Indian expansionists. A so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" full of loopholes and distorting the facts was issued a few days ago. Indian expansionists are stirring up trouble over the Tibet issue, discussing our country's problems in the Indian People's House, and interfering in our internal affairs. A group of People's Socialist Party members in Mumbai, with the connivance of the local police authorities, insulted the statue of our great leader Chairman Mao at our country's consulate in the area. We express our utmost indignation at this act of hostility towards our country.

Tibet is an inseparable part of our great motherland, and we will never allow foreigners to interfere in our internal affairs. China and India have been friendly neighbors for more than 2,000 years. Our two governments are the initiators of the "Five Principles." We should work together to safeguard the friendly relations between the two countries and jointly oppose imperialism. However, the Indian expansionists are now providing all kinds of support to a small group of Tibetan traitors who have fled to India, seriously threatening the friendly relations between China and India and the Five Principles. This is intolerable to the Chinese people. We want to warn the imperialists and Indian expansionists that if they do not quickly pull back from the brink, they will inevitably be battered and bruised.

The 1959 national economic plan is a plan for our country to continue to leap forward. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we industrialists and businessmen must strengthen transformation, contribute all our strength, and join the people of the whole country to complete or over fulfill this grand plan in order to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland.

    改造远未成功同仁亟需努力
    乐松生代表的发言
    我以万分兴奋的心情，听了周恩来总理所作的“政府工作报告”、李富春副总理“关于一九五九年国家经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”和彭真副委员长
  “关于人大常务委员会工作报告”，使我受到一次深刻的社会主义教育，给了我极大的鼓舞，对这些报告我完全拥护。
    我国第一个五年计划胜利完成，建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础，一九五八年出现了我国历史上空前未有的国民经济大跃进。在工业和农业以及运输、邮电、商业、文化教育等方面，都有了巨大的跃进。在大跃进中，一种新的社会组织——人民公社，像初升的太阳一样，在全国广大农村中普遍建立起来。这些辉煌成就，是党和毛主席英明领导和全国人民努力执行党的社会主义建设总路线、英勇劳动的结果，同时也是和以苏联为首的社会主义各国的无私援助分不开的。这就鼓舞了全国人民更加振奋，以乘风破浪的豪迈气概，在今年将出现更大更好更全面的大跃进。
    十年来的亲身感受，体会到党对工商业者的关怀，体会到改造政策的正确和伟大
    在祖国建设大跃进面前，每一个爱国的工商业者决不能无动于衷的。解放以来，中国共产党和人民政府，对于我们工商业者是根据我国的具体情况和历史条件，采取了和平改造的政策。目的是把私营工商业改造成为社会主义性质的企业，也就是全民所有制的企业；并把资产阶级分子改造成为劳动人民。公私合营以后，企业改造已经基本完成，但在人的改造方面，还需要继续进行立场思想的根本改造。十年来以我的亲身感受，深深体验到和平改造政策的正确和伟大。党为了使我们工商业者通过自我改造，逐步由剥削者转变为劳动人民，一贯采取和风细雨的方法，苦口婆心、谆谆教诲，不仅对于我们的工作、学习、劳动和生活，给予特别照顾，还对我们的点滴成绩，都是加以鼓励的。我们工商业者通过自我改造，丢掉的只是那些资本主义又脏又臭的东西，而得到的却是社会主义光明前途。因此我们工商业者接受社会主义改造是好事，而且也是光荣的。
    这次周总理在政府工作报告中又指出：“对于资本家，国家将按照原定的期限付给定息，并且将积极地帮助他们在参加社会主义建设的工作中继续进行自我教育和自我改造。”这使我更体会到党和人民政府对我们工商业者的关怀照顾是无微不至。那么，在祖国经济建设大跃进中，我们工商业者应该怎样加强改造、积极服务，做出贡献，发挥作用呢？
    工商界多数人的两面性依然存在，两条道路斗争的问题还没有解决，改造得不是差不多了，而是还差得多
    一年多来，我们北京市工商业者经过了反右派斗争和整风运动，受到了极为深刻的“破资立社”的教育和锻炼，多数人在政治、思想上得到不同程度的进步，提高了觉悟，明辨了大是大非，认识到必须接受共产党的领导，走社会主义道路，并且有不少人在企业和其他工作岗位上在劳动人民的带动下，参加了工农业生产大跃进和各种不同的劳动锻炼，为社会主义建设事业做出了一定的贡献。但是，按毛主席指示的六项政治标准来衡量，我们工商界多数人的两面性依然存在，两条道路斗争问题还没有解决。改造得不是差不多了，而是差得很多，因此，我们必须继续加强政治立场和思想的根本改造。
    我们工商业者的改造，是“脱胎换骨”的根本改造。由于我们有党的领导、工人群众的监督和社会主义建设大跃进形势的推动，因此，我们的改造条件是非常有利的，只要我们主观上积极努力，是可以改造好的。当然，阶级立场思想的改造，是长期的、曲折的和复杂的。客观的条件虽然对我们这样有利，但是我们每个人改造得好与坏，主要是取决于我们每个人的主观努力如何。通过反右派斗争、整风运动，我们工商界多数人虽然在政治思想上有了不同程度的进步，但这个进步还是有快有慢、时快时慢，有进有退、时进时退，在前进中有反复，在反复中前进的。因此，我认为我们工商业者只有加强政治立场思想的根本改造，积极为社会主义建设服务，才能跟上伟大形势的发展。
    毛主席教导我们：“工商业者的彻底改造，必须是在工作中间，他们应当在企业同职工一起劳动，把企业作为自我改造的基地，但是经过学习改变自己的某些旧观点，也是重要的。”毛主席这一指示，是我们工商业者必须遵循的道路。因此我们工商业者的改造，必须坚决贯彻以政治思想改造为统帅、以劳动和实践为基础、以企业或者工作岗位为基地，并把三者结合起来的方针，也就是加强改造，积极参加社会主义建设，在实践中改造自己。因此，我们要经常以毛主席指示的六项政治标准来衡量自己、鞭策自己。忠诚接受党的领导和工人群众的监督。加强政治理论学习，特别是对毛主席著作的学习，积极投入我市的增产节约运动，献技、献策，贡献出自己的力量。
    西藏叛乱，是西藏反动集团自取灭亡，反而为西藏民主化和建设新西藏造成有利条件
    当着我们在积极建设社会主义的时候，帝国主义和一切反动派是不会甘心的，它们时时刻刻、千方百计地企图破坏我们的辉煌成就，我们一定要提高警惕。最近西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义劫持达赖喇嘛背叛祖国，纠集叛匪发动了破坏国家统一、破坏民族团结的武装叛乱，就是一个铁证。我们工商业者坚决拥护国务院解散西藏地方政府，责成人民解放军彻底平息叛乱以及所采取的一切措施。这一小撮反动分子的叛乱活动，完全违背了西藏人民的利益和全国各族人民的共同利益，因此必然要遭到彻底的失败。事实上在西藏爱国僧俗人民的积极协助下，人民解放军已经平定了这次叛乱。西藏反动分子自取灭亡，实际上反而为西藏的民主化和建设新西藏造成了极其有利的条件。我们高兴地看到：西藏人民将从此逐步摆脱贫苦落后的黑暗生活，走上繁荣进步的光明大道。
    现在逃到印度的一小撮西藏叛国分子正在和英帝国主义以及印度的扩张主义分子进一步勾结起来，前几天发表了一个漏洞百出、颠倒黑白的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。印度扩张主义分子就西藏问题兴风作浪，在印度的人民院讨论我们国家的问题，干涉我们内政。孟买的一群人民社会党徒，在当地警察当局的纵容下，竟在该地我国领事馆侮辱我国伟大领袖毛主席像，这种敌视我国的行为，我们表示万分愤慨。
    西藏是我们伟大祖国不可分割的一部分，我们决不容许外国人干涉我国的内政。中印两国二千多年来是友好的邻邦，我们两国政府是“五项原则”的倡议者，我们应该共同努力维护两国间的友好关系，共同反对帝国主义。而现在印度的扩张主义分子对于逃到印度的一小撮西藏叛国分子，给以种种支持，使中印两国的友好关系和五项原则遭到严重的威胁，这是我国人民不能容忍的。我们要警告帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子，如不赶快悬崖勒马，必然将要碰得头破血流。
    一九五九年的国民经济计划，是我国一个继续大跃进的计划，我们工商业者一定要在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导下，加强改造，贡献一切力量，跟全国人民一道，完成或超额完成这一宏伟计划，来迎接我们伟大的祖国国庆十周年。
