Beijing Recycles Large Amounts of Waste to Support Industrial Production

(Our report) Beijing is vigorously carrying out mass waste recycling work, providing many raw materials for industrial departments.

The mass waste recycling work started in January this year. Up to now, more than 10,000 tons of various waste materials have been recycled, an increase of 14% compared with the same period last year. Among them are 148 tons of non-ferrous metals such as scrap copper, tin, and zinc, more than 3,000 tons of wrought iron, pig iron, and ferrous metals, and more than 6,000 tons of light industrial raw materials such as waste paper and cloth scraps. These waste materials are good raw materials needed by industrial production departments and have now been supplied to light and heavy industrial departments for utilization. The Yanjing and Qinghe paper mills, which originally felt the shortage of raw materials, have guaranteed normal production after receiving a large amount of waste paper, cloth scraps, and worn shoes. The public-private joint venture No. 3 Glass Factory has significantly improved its production efficiency in the Great Leap Forward, and the need for raw materials has also increased. After obtaining sufficient waste glass, the factory has completed its plan to produce 1,300 tons of glass in the first quarter as scheduled. A batch of recycled scrap iron sheets have been processed by many factories and handicraft production cooperatives and have now been made into a large number of small commodities and hardware products needed by the market, such as shoe eyelets, hairpins, backpack awls, and spectacle cases. Many iron factories in the suburbs have used 160 tons of recycled scrap steel to make various small farm tools, which strongly support the spring plowing production of the people's communes. Some repair and maintenance industries have also obtained many needed raw materials from waste materials.

The great achievements in waste recycling in Beijing are due not only to the attention and personal leadership of party and government departments at all levels, but also mainly to the implementation of the "walking on two legs" policy, that is, combining mobile recycling with fixed recycling, according to the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and gradually overcoming the shortcomings of being divorced from the masses in the acquisition work. Appropriately increasing the number of acquisition personnel and acquisition points, and relying on street offices and various retail stores to assist in collection, has greatly facilitated the sale of the masses. Acquisition staff generally provide both publicity and acquisition services, with a proactive and enthusiastic attitude, collecting whenever people want to sell, which is welcomed by the masses. In addition, in terms of price, the principle of pricing according to quality and paying higher prices for higher quality has been initially implemented, and some adjustments have been made to some materials with lower prices.

    北京回收大量废品支援工业生产
    本报讯　北京市大力开展群众性的废品回收工作，为工业部门提供很多原料。
    群众性的废品回收工作，是从今年1月开始的。到目前止，回收的各种废品物资已有一万多吨，比去年同期多收购了14％。其中有杂铜、锡、锌等有色金属一百四十八吨，熟铁、生铁、黑色金属三千多吨，废纸、布毛等轻工业原料六千多吨。这些废旧物资都是工业生产部门需要的好原料，现在已经分别供应给轻重工业部门利用。原来感到原料不足的燕京、清河等造纸厂，在得到大量废纸、布毛、破鞋等废品后，保证了正常生产。公私合营第三玻璃厂在大跃进中，生产效率有了显著提高，需要的原材料也更多了，这个厂在得到充分的废旧玻璃之后，第一季度生产一千三百吨玻璃的计划已经如期实现。回收来的一批废旧铁皮，经过许多工厂、手工业生产合作社的加工，现在已制成大批鞋眼、发卡、背包钎子、眼镜盒等市场需要的小百货和小五金了。郊区许多铁工厂把回收来的一百六十吨废钢材制成了各种小农具，有力地支援了人民公社的春耕生产。一些修配、修理行业也从废品物资中得到所需要的许多原料。
    北京市废品回收能够取得巨大成绩，除了各级党政部门重视，亲自领导这一工作外，主要是根据中共北京市委的指示，在收购工作中逐步克服了脱离群众的缺点，贯彻了两条腿走路，即流动收购和固定收购相结合的方针。适当地增加了收购人员和收购点，并依靠街道办事处和各个零售商店协助代收，这就大大便利了群众出售。收购工作人员一般都作到了一面宣传一面收购，服务态度主动、热情，什么时候卖什么时候收，受到了群众的欢迎。此外，在价格方面，也初步贯彻了按质论价，优质优价的原则，对一些价格偏低的物资作了一些调整。
