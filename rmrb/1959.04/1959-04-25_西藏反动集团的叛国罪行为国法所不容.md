Statement by Gao Kelin, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report, and fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now I will give a brief statement on the work of the Supreme People's Court since 1955.

The number of cases handled by the people's courts has decreased significantly in recent years, proving that our country is more consolidated, social order is more stable, people's lives are better, and the people are more united.

The task of the Supreme People's Court is to try criminal and civil cases within the scope prescribed by law, and to supervise the trial work of local people's courts at all levels and specialized people's courts.

Since 1955, the number of cases accepted by people's courts at all levels across the country, except for individual times when this year was slightly more than the previous year, has generally shown a downward trend. In 1958, due to the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially after September, due to the realization of people's communes in rural areas across the country, the downward trend in the number of cases accepted was even more significant. Obviously, this is a reflection of the great victories achieved in China's socialist revolution and construction. It shows that our country has become more consolidated and social order has become more stable; it also shows that the people's material lives are improving day by day, the degree of political awareness is increasing day by day, and the unity within the people is increasing day by day.

Handling appeals from parties is also an important task of the Supreme People's Court. In the past four years, the number of appeals accepted by the Supreme People's Court has also generally shown a downward trend. Judging from the results of our handling of appeals: the vast majority of original judgments were correct and appeals were unfounded, and a very small number of original judgments were improper and appeals were justified. Despite this, we still believe that the appeals of the parties can help us and the local people's courts to examine and improve trial work; at the same time, higher-level people's courts can also supervise the trial work of lower-level people's courts by handling appeals. Therefore, we must continue to do this work seriously in the future.

During this period, the Supreme People's Court also did a lot of work in supervising and guiding the work of local people's courts at all levels and specialized people's courts, among which the main ones are:

Implementing the Organic Law of the People's Courts

I. Implementing the Organic Law of the People's Courts. After the promulgation of the Organic Law of the People's Courts, we immediately worked with the judicial administration departments to conduct education on observing the Constitution and the Organic Law of the People's Courts among judicial cadres across the country; at the same time, we guided the people's courts in various places to actively and step-by-step implement various trial systems in accordance with the principles stipulated in the Organic Law of the People's Courts. The implementation of the Organic Law of the People's Courts has not only made the organizational system of the judicial organs more sound, but also enabled the vast number of judicial cadres to further improve their ideological level, strengthen their concept of the socialist legal system, and improve their trial style.

Guiding the trial work of the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries

II. Guiding the trial work of the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. In 1955, on the eve of the high tide of the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production, U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang stepped up espionage activities. The remnant counter-revolutionaries in the country colluded with those spies and secret agents, echoing each other, and carried out sabotage in many ways, attempting to obstruct our cause from moving forward. At the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, many representatives' speeches and proposals called for severely punishing counter-revolutionaries. The "Resolution on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" passed at that meeting also pointed out that it is necessary to "eliminate all open and hidden counter-revolutionaries and crush the sabotage activities of domestic and foreign enemies against China's socialist construction and socialist transformation." In accordance with the spirit of this resolution, we immediately guided the local people's courts to work with the procuratorial and public security organs, under the leadership of the Party and the state, and relying on the masses, launched a struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. In this struggle, the people's courts at all levels across the country, based on the requirements of correctness, legality, and timeliness, tried and judged the counter-revolutionary and other major criminal cases prosecuted by the procuratorial organs, and severely punished counter-revolutionary criminals and other criminals who disrupted social order.

In the spring of 1956, China achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production. The Party and the state timely put forward the policy of further implementing the leniency policy under the premise of resolutely eliminating the remnant forces of counter-revolutionaries. In order to implement this policy, we worked with the judicial administration departments to make a relatively systematic summary of the trial work experience of the national people's courts at all levels in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries in 1955, and put forward opinions on the policy boundaries for handling counter-revolutionary and other major criminal offenders; this summary was passed at the Third National Judicial Work Conference in 1956, and submitted to the Standing Committee of the First National People's Congress for filing. Practice has proved that this summary basically conformed to the situation and work needs at that time.

Review of cases in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries

III. In order to consolidate the achievements of this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and correctly implement the Party and state's policy of "counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, mistakes must be corrected," in the summer of 1956, we worked with the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Justice to instruct the local people's courts and procuratorial, public security, and judicial administration organs to review the cases handled in the 1955 struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. This review work lasted for more than half a year and was done quite universally and meticulously. The results of the review proved that, due to the firm and correct implementation of the Party and state's policies, the full mobilization of the masses, and the serious conduct of investigation and research, the achievements of this struggle were great and the experiences were rich. The vast majority of cases judged by people's courts at all levels across the country in this struggle were correct, and only a very small number of cases had deviations in the judgment, that is, cases where a serious crime was lightly punished or a minor crime was heavily punished. The courts concerned promptly corrected these cases with deviations in accordance with the law.

Summarizing the experience of trial work

IV. During this period, in addition to summarizing the experience of the trial work in eliminating counter-revolutionaries, we also summarized the experience in the trial procedures of criminal and civil cases. In order to correctly implement the Organic Law of the People's Courts, from 1955 to 1956, we summarized the experience of the people's courts in fourteen large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai in trying criminal and civil cases, and on the basis of this summary, completed the summary of the trial procedures of criminal and civil cases of the people's courts at all levels across the country. After this summary was submitted to the Standing Committee of the First National People's Congress for filing, it was issued to local people's courts at all levels and specialized people's courts for reference and trial implementation. Since 1958, the mass line of trial work has had new developments. We will continue to guide the people's courts in various places to conduct research and collation, so as to modify, enrich, and improve the original summary of the trial procedures of criminal and civil cases, so as to adapt it to the needs of work development.

In the above-mentioned work process, there is a struggle between two lines. Some bourgeois rightists who mixed into the judicial circles and those who insisted on bourgeois legal viewpoints, stood on a reactionary position and tried their best to oppose the people's courts serving the task of the people's democratic dictatorship; tried their best to oppose the Party's leadership over the work of the courts; tried their best to oppose the mass line of judicial work; tried their best to oppose the instructions made by the Party and the state based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, combining China's specific conditions, proceeding from reality, relying on the masses, conducting investigations and research, seeking truth from facts, emphasizing evidence and not lightly believing confessions, and that evidence must be verified, opposing forced confessions and believing in them. This struggle on the judicial front has never been interrupted since the founding of the country. After the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, we finally achieved a decisive victory in this struggle. This victory not only solved those fundamental issues that had been debated for a long time on the judicial front, but also profoundly educated the judicial cadres politically and ideologically, laying a more reliable foundation for the judicial work to adhere to the correct direction prescribed by the Party and the state.

The people's courts should take the mass line in a big way, implement the combination of judicial work and productive labor, and absorb the masses to participate in trial activities, which can not only improve the efficiency and quality of handling cases, but also fully conduct socialist legal system education for the masses.

In 1958, driven by the nationwide Great Leap Forward, judicial work also showed a leaping situation suitable for its own situation and tasks. In the Great Leap Forward, the people's courts in various places took the mass line in a big way, implemented the combination of judicial work and productive labor, and served socialist construction more actively. According to the situation of accepted cases, the trial personnel of people's courts in various places, mainly the grassroots people's courts, went deep into industrial and agricultural production, lived with workers and peasants, participated in productive labor on the one hand, and relied on the masses to try cases on the spot or guide the work of mediation committees on the spot. In terms of trial methods, the principle of combining the mass line with seeking truth from facts was conscientiously implemented. For some cases that do not involve state secrets or the privacy of the parties, when hearing them, masses are deliberately absorbed to participate in forums and debates. This practice can enable the people to participate in trial activities more widely, make it easier to find out the truth of the case, prevent mistakes, make the case handled well and quickly, and can also more fully conduct socialist legal system education to the people. This practice enables the people's courts to better serve industrial and agricultural production and serve the central work of the Party and the state, and enables judicial cadres to further strengthen their ties with workers and peasants and completely eliminate the "three styles" and "five airs." This practice also enables judicial cadres to enrich their social knowledge and gain production knowledge, which is conducive to the gradual combination of mental labor and physical labor.

The current domestic and international situation is very good. When implementing the policy of combining punishment with leniency for counter-revolutionaries and other criminals who disrupt social order, we should pay attention to the aspect of leniency according to law under the condition of continuing to maintain vigilance. However, leniency according to law is not boundless leniency, and those counter-revolutionaries and other criminals who continue to carry out sabotage activities should still be given due punishment.

Recently, the armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique, which betrayed the motherland and harmed the Tibetan people, has been shamefully defeated. Tibet is an inseparable part of our motherland, and the Tibetan nationality is a member of the big family of nationalities in our country. The Tibetan traitorous clique colluded with imperialism, foreign reactionaries, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to launch an armed rebellion in an attempt to separate Tibet from the motherland. It is a serious act of treason and is intolerable under national law. For the ringleaders of the traitorous clique and other deceived and coerced elements, we will handle them separately according to their circumstances in accordance with the established policy of the Party and the state of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service."

Cases dealing with contradictions among the people should be mainly mediated; cases involving civil disputes and minor illegal acts should be resolved on the spot by relying on the masses through the mediation committees as much as possible.

Handling cases of civil disputes and general illegal acts is still an important task of the people's courts at present. The vast majority of such cases belong to the nature of contradictions among the people. All cases that belong to the nature of contradictions among the people should be mainly mediated when handling them, and full persuasion and education should be carried out in order to achieve the purpose of distinguishing right from wrong, maintaining law and discipline, benefiting production, enhancing unity among the people, and promoting communist morality.

Now, the mediation committees or public security mediation committees have been generally established in various places, and the patriotic covenants used by the people to educate and restrain themselves have also been generally formulated. This is an important part of China's socialist legal system construction. We believe that the people's courts in various places, mainly the grassroots people's courts, should strengthen their ties with the mediation committees or public security mediation committees in conjunction with the procuratorial and public security organs, help and guide the mediation committees or public security mediation committees to carry out their work, conscientiously give play to the role of patriotic covenants, so that some civil disputes and cases belonging to minor illegal acts can be resolved on the spot by relying on the masses as much as possible.

Summarizing the experience of trial work is of great importance for continuously improving the policy and ideological level and professional ability of trial workers, improving the style of trial work, and improving the quality of case trials. We and the people's courts in various places must regard the work of summarizing trial experience as a regular and important task and do it effectively.

The national economic plan for 1959, which will be discussed and approved at this meeting, is an inspiring and grand plan. We will, together with the national judicial cadres, continue to go all out and aim high under the leadership of the Party and the state, unswervingly implement the mass line and the policy of combining judicial work with productive labor, and guarantee a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959 from the aspect of judicial work.

专栏：

    西藏反动集团的叛国罪行为国法所不容
    最高人民法院高克林副院长的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的报告，完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。现在我把一九五五年以来最高人民法院的工作情况，作个简要的发言。
    几年以来，人民法院处理案件的数量有显著下降，证明我们国家更加巩固，社会秩序更加安定，人民生活更加改善，人民内部更加团结
    最高人民法院的任务是，在法律规定的范围内，审判刑事和民事案件，监督地方各级人民法院和专门人民法院的审判工作。
    从一九五五年以来，全国各级人民法院受理的案件数量，除了个别时候，这一年度比之上一年度稍有增加以外，总的看来是下降的趋势。在一九五八年，由于工农业生产大跃进，特别是九月以后，由于在全国农村中实现了人民公社化，收案数量下降的趋势更加显著。显然，这是我国社会主义革命和建设，取得伟大胜利的一种反映。它说明了我们的国家已经更加巩固，社会秩序更加安定；也说明了人民群众物质生活的日益改善，政治觉悟程度的日益提高，人民内部的团结日益增强。
    处理当事人的申诉，也是最高人民法院的一项重要工作。四年以来，最高人民法院受理的申诉，总的也是下降的趋势。从我们处理申诉的结果来看：原判正确、申诉没有理由的占绝大多数，原判不当、申诉有理由的是极少数。尽管这样，我们仍然认为当事人的申诉，可以帮助我们和地方人民法院，来考察和改进审判工作；同时，上级人民法院也可以通过处理申诉，来对下级人民法院的审判工作实行监督。因此，我们今后仍然要认真严肃地做好这项工作。
    在这个时期，最高人民法院在监督和指导地方各级人民法院和专门人民法院的工作方面，还做了许多工作，其中主要的有：
    贯彻了人民法院的组织法
    一、贯彻人民法院组织法。人民法院组织法公布以后，我们立即会同司法行政部门，在全国司法干部中，认真地进行了遵守宪法和人民法院组织法的教育；同时，指导各地人民法院，遵照人民法院组织法所规定的各项原则，积极而又有步骤地实行了各项审判制度。人民法院组织法的贯彻执行，不仅使司法机关的组织制度更加健全了，也使广大司法干部进一步提高了思想水平，加强了社会主义法制观念，改进了审判作风。
    指导了肃清反革命斗争的审判工作
    二、指导肃清反革命斗争的审判工作。一九五五年，在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命高潮到来的前夜，美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，加紧了间谍特务活动。国内的残余反革命分子同那些间谍特务分子狼狈为奸，互相呼应，从许多方面进行破坏，企图阻挠我们的事业前进。在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，很多代表的发言和提案，都要求严厉地惩治反革命分子。在那次会议上通过的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的决议”中，也指出必须“肃清一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子，粉碎国内国外敌人对我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的破坏活动”。根据这个决议的精神，我们立即指导地方各级人民法院会同检察、公安机关，在党和国家的领导下，依靠群众，展开了肃清反革命的斗争。在这次斗争中，由检察机关起诉的反革命和其他重大刑事案件，全国各级人民法院，都本着正确、合法、及时的要求，进行了审理和判决，严厉地惩治了反革命罪犯和其他破坏社会秩序的刑事罪犯。
    一九五六年春天，我国在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利。党和国家适时地提出了在坚决肃清反革命残余势力的前提下，进一步实行宽大政策的方针。为了贯彻这个方针，我们会同司法行政部门，对全国各级人民法院一九五五年肃清反革命斗争的审判工作经验，作了比较系统的总结，提出了处理反革命和其他重大刑事罪犯的政策界限的意见；在一九五六年第三届全国司法工作会议上，通过了这个总结，并报请第一届全国人民代表大会常务委员会备案，实践证明，这个总结是基本上符合当时形势和工作需要的。
    复查了肃反中的案件
    三、为了巩固这次肃清反革命斗争的成绩，正确地贯彻党和国家的“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针，在一九五六年夏季，我们会同最高人民检察院、公安部和司法部，责成地方各级人民法院和检察、公安、司法行政机关，就一九五五年肃清反革命斗争中处理的案件，进行了复查。这次复查工作历时半年以上，做得相当普遍和细致。复查的结果证明，这次斗争，由于坚决、正确地执行了党和国家的方针、政策，充分发动了群众，认真进行了调查研究工作，成绩是巨大的，经验是丰富的。全国各级人民法院在这次斗争中判决的案件，绝大部分是正确的，判决有偏差的案件，即重罪轻判或者轻罪重判的案件，只是极少数。对这种有偏差的案件，有关的法院都及时地依法作了纠正。
    总结了审判工作的经验
    四、在这个时期，我们除总结了肃清反革命斗争的审判工作的经验以外，还总结了刑事、民事案件审理程序的经验。为了正确地贯彻执行人民法院组织法，在一九五五年到一九五六年，我们对北京、天津、上海等十四个大、中城市人民法院审理刑事、民事案件程序的经验，进行了总结，并在这个总结的基础上，完成了全国各级人民法院刑事、民事案件审理程序的总结。这个总结，在报请第一届全国人民代表大会常务委员会备案以后，曾发到地方各级人民法院和专门人民法院参酌试行。一九五八年以来，审判工作的群众路线有了新的发展。对此，我们将继续指导各地人民法院进行研究、整理，以便把原来所做的刑事、民事案件审理程序总结加以修改、充实和提高，使它适应工作发展的需要。
    在上述各项工作过程中，是存在着两条道路的斗争的。一些混入司法界的资产阶级右派分子和坚持资产阶级法律观点的人，站在反动的立场上，竭力反对人民法院为人民民主专政的任务服务；竭力反对党对法院工作的领导；竭力反对司法工作的群众路线；竭力反对党和国家根据马克思列宁主义的原则，结合我国的具体情况所作的从实际出发，依靠群众，调查研究，实事求是，重证据不轻信口供，证据还必须经过查对，反对逼供信等指示。司法战线上的这场斗争，从建国以来一直没有间断过。经过一九五七年整风和反右派斗争，我们终于取得了这场斗争的决定性的胜利。这个胜利，不仅解决了司法战线上长期争论的那些根本性的问题，而且在政治上和思想上，深刻地教育了司法干部，为司法工作坚持党和国家规定的正确方向，奠定了更加可靠的基础。
    人民法院应该大走群众路线，实行司法工作与生产劳动相结合，吸收群众参加审判活动，既能提高办案的效率和质量，又能充分对群众进行社会主义的法制教育
    一九五八年，在全民大跃进的推动下，司法工作同样出现了一个适合自己情况和任务的跃进的局面。各地人民法院在跃进中，大走群众路线，实行司法工作与生产劳动相结合，更加积极地为社会主义建设服务。各地人民法院主要是基层人民法院的审判人员，根据受理案件的情况，深入到工农业生产中去，同工人农民生活在一起，一面参加生产劳动，一面依靠群众就地审理案件，或者就地指导调处委员会的工作。在审判方法上，认真执行了群众路线和实事求是相结合的原则。对某些不涉及国家机密或当事人隐私的案件，在审理的时候，有准备地吸收群众参加座谈、辩论。这种做法，可以使人民群众更广泛地参与审判活动，便于查清案情，防止差错，使案件办得又好又快，也可以更充分地向人民群众进行社会主义的法制教育。这种做法，使人民法院能够更好地为工农业生产服务，为党和国家的中心工作服务，使司法干部能够进一步密切同工农群众的联系，彻底扫除“三风”“五气”。这种做法，还使司法干部能够丰富社会知识和获得生产知识，有利于脑力劳动和体力劳动的逐步结合。
    当前国内外的形势很好。我们对反革命和其他破坏社会秩序的刑事罪犯，在执行惩办与宽大相结合的政策的时候，在继续保持警惕的情况下，应注意依法从宽的一面。但是，依法从宽，不是宽大无边，对那些继续进行破坏活动的反革命分子和其他犯罪分子，仍应给以应有的惩处。
    最近，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的背叛祖国、残害西藏人民的武装叛乱，已经遭到了可耻的失败。西藏是我们祖国不可分割的一部分，西藏民族是我国各民族大家庭的一员。西藏的叛国集团勾结帝国主义、外国反动派和蒋介石匪帮，发动武装叛乱，企图把西藏从祖国分裂出去，是一种严重的叛国罪行，实为国法所不容。对于叛国集团的首恶分子及其他被欺骗被胁从的分子，我们将本着党和国家既定的“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的政策，按其情况，分别处理。
    处理人民内部矛盾性质的案件，应以调解为主；凡属民事纠纷和轻微的违法行为的案件，应尽可能通过调处委员会依靠群众就地解决
    处理民事纠纷和一般的违法行为的案件，仍然是人民法院当前的一项重要工作。这种案件，绝大多数是属于人民内部矛盾性质的问题。凡是属于人民内部矛盾性质的案件，在处理时，应该以调解为主，进行充分的说服教育，以便达到分清是非、维护法纪、有利生产、增强人民内部团结和发扬共产主义道德风气的目的。
    现在，各地的调处委员会或治安调处委员会已经普遍地建立起来，人民群众用以教育自己、约束自己的爱国公约，也已经普遍制定了，这是我国社会主义法制建设的一个重要的组成部分。我们认为，各地人民法院，主要是基层人民法院，应当会同检察、公安机关，加强同调处委员会或治安调处委员会的联系，帮助和指导调处委员会或治安调处委员会开展工作，认真地发挥爱国公约的作用，使一些民事纠纷和属于轻微的违法行为的案件，尽可能地依靠群众就地解决。
    总结审判工作经验，对不断提高审判工作人员的政策思想水平和业务能力，改进审判作风，提高案件审判的质量，都有重要的作用。我们和各地人民法院，一定要把总结审判经验的工作，当成一项经常的重要任务，切实把它做好。
    即将在这次会议上讨论通过的一九五九年的国民经济计划，是一个振奋人心的宏伟计划。我们将和全国司法干部一起，在党和国家的领导下继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，坚定不移地贯彻群众路线和司法工作与生产劳动相结合的方针，从司法工作方面，来保障一九五九年工农业生产更大更好更全面的跃进。
