I fully endorse the various reports presented at this conference. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, I felt even more excited. I believe that our central government, whether in domestic policy or international affairs, handles all issues with great wisdom, proactiveness, and correctness. The path we are taking is the bright road of socialism, and the work we are doing is a just revolutionary cause. Any slanderous clamoring or sabotage by imperialists, reactionary groups, or rebellious elements is in vain. Our people are more united than ever under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We have stood up and can no longer be bullied. We are now working with unparalleled vigor, at a speed of one day equaling twenty years, to build our great motherland. Let the imperialists and reactionary groups tremble before us!

In the 1959 national economic plan, regarding agriculture: grain production is to reach 1,050 billion jin, cotton production is to reach 100 million dan, and other agricultural products are required to have varying degrees of growth. This plan is very ambitious. We are full of confidence and believe that this can be achieved, and even surpassed. To achieve this goal, in terms of technical measures, we must do a good job with the "Eight-Character Charter" of agriculture. Every word in this charter is indispensable. Pest control also occupies a very important position within the "protection" character of the charter. If the other characters are done well, but the "protection" character is not implemented effectively and pest infestations occur, then things will be terrible. It is clear that pest problems are a matter that requires constant and close attention on the agricultural production front. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the prevention and control of agricultural pests. The purpose is to illustrate that there are ways to eliminate pest infestations. I hope that all parties will strengthen their confidence and work hard to launch a vigorous struggle against various pests in order to strive for a comprehensive and great agricultural harvest this year. According to the agricultural seasons and preventive measures, we can divide it into the following three main parts for a brief description:

    Improving Agricultural Techniques is an Effective Pest Control Measure

1.  At present, prevention and control must be combined with various agricultural techniques—The spring planting in the south has ended, and the summer harvest in the north is still some time away. Across the country, both paddy and dryland crops are currently in a state of growth and development. In agricultural matters, the most important thing to pay attention to is field management. Pest control work can be carried out simultaneously in conjunction with field management and cultivation techniques. The occurrence of various pests is often caused by poor agricultural techniques. Improving production techniques can eliminate pest infestations invisibly. "There are only poor agricultural techniques, no pests that cannot be controlled." In recent years, after investigating various aspects, I have deeply realized that there is almost no method of cultivation, planting, or management that cannot be combined with pest control work. For example, in terms of cultivation, if we can achieve meticulous farming; immediately plow and harrow after harvesting any crop; harrow the rice fields two or three times; cultivate the cotton fields many times while simultaneously mounding soil; and combine plowing and harrowing with weeding and removing stumps to keep the ground clean. These are all effective pest control techniques. Conversely, if we practice extensive planting; shallow plowing without harrowing; neglect to plow fields after harvesting various crops; fail to harrow rice fields; cultivate cotton fields infrequently; or rarely cultivate and weed other dryland crops; and allow many cultivated lands to lie fallow, then pest infestations will often occur. Other field management tasks such as irrigation, drainage, and fertilization are, of course, indispensable measures for increasing production, and we must make extra efforts to do them well now. At the same time, they are also the most fundamental pest control methods and cannot be ignored. If we can study this in depth, we can find many pest control tips, and pest control is extremely achievable. There are too many facts to describe in detail, I will only give one example, and the rest can be inferred: Pingxiang County in Jiangxi Province is now a pest-free county, mainly because it has achieved such results through good agricultural prevention and control over the years. The Luxi People's Commune in the county has particularly good pest control results. Before liberation, pest infestations were often severe. Taking 1949 as an example, the average loss of grain per mu due to pest infestations in the commune's original cultivated area reached 70 jin. Starting in 1950, the original 36 cooperatives of the commune launched a pest control campaign, often combining various agricultural techniques with pest control, and the pest infestations were eliminated. Since 1951, there has been little pest damage, and large increases in production have been achieved continuously every year, making it one of the most advanced people's communes in Jiangxi Province.

    Create Various Methods to Eliminate Pests

2.  In areas with many pests, pesticides can be used—The period when pests are most rampant across the country is generally in June, July, and August. In some places, if the various agricultural prevention and control tasks mentioned above have not been done well, then by this time, one has to play the last trump card, and apply pesticides for a concentrated, painful killing. Chemical agents that can kill pests, such as 666, DDT, Trichlorfon, 1605 and 1059, are all very effective poisons. As for native pesticides, more than 500 kinds have been created across the country. For example, tobacco stems, lime, camphor oil, and thunder vine are all very effective in killing insects. If pesticides are sufficient, they can be used as much as possible everywhere, as long as the forecasting and reporting work is done well, the pest situation is grasped, and the pesticide application techniques are mastered, there is no problem in controlling any pest. Now various pests are about to breed, and various pesticides and machinery should be prepared quickly to prevent problems before they occur. However, at present, various pesticides cannot be supplied to the vast areas of cultivated land across the country for large-scale, universal use. Only a portion can be allocated for concentrated, painful killing. This means that we cannot rely solely on pesticides to solve the problem, and we cannot think that pest control is impossible without pesticides, or that we are helpless without pesticides and do not think of other methods. This is not necessarily true. There are many methods of combining agricultural prevention and control. It is easy to control pests if there are pesticides, and it is also possible to control pests without pesticides.

    Eliminating Overwintering Pests is the Main Link in Pest Control

3.  Special attention should be paid to eliminating overwintering pests—Eliminating overwintering pests is the most important link in pest control work. All localities should start from the autumn to create pest-free conditions for next year's agricultural production. The methods used can be completely combined with cultivation techniques. Whether it is paddy fields or dryland fields, if it can be ensured that there are no fields that overwinter without being plowed; the residual stalks, dead branches, fallen leaves, dried flowers, and rotten fruits of field crops are all cleared away; and the weeds on the field ridges and near the fields are all removed, then it will be very difficult for various pests in the fields to escape this gate of hell and be able to reproduce in large numbers in the following year. In Jiangxi, thanks to the attention of party and government leaders at all levels in the province, this work has been closely grasped for ten years, continuously expanding the area of autumn and winter replanting and reducing fallow farmland, which can reduce the overwintering sites of various pests. And continuously promote three cultivations (active autumn plowing, universal winter plowing, and early spring plowing) and three clearances (weeds cleared, fallow fields plowed, and rice roots cleared), especially the winter plowing and pest elimination campaign, which is done more universally, eliminating pests wherever they are found hiding. Therefore, rice stem borers, which were considered impossible to deal with before liberation, have been overcome. The total loss due to rice stem borers in the province, which was often 20% to 30% annually before liberation, has been reduced to less than 1% last year. The total grain output of the province has increased from about 8 billion jin in 1949 to 24 billion jin last year, three times that of 1949. Such an astonishing miracle was undreamt of before liberation. The pests of other crops such as cotton and wheat have also been significantly reduced. Of course, some pesticide control is also often combined, but the area using agricultural technology for prevention and control is wider, accounting for about nine-tenths of the total cultivated area of the province. There are countless examples like this across the country. The south emphasizes winter plowing to eliminate insects; the north advocates autumn plowing to eliminate stumps; and Xinjiang promotes autumn plowing and winter irrigation. The principles are the same, and the purpose is to eliminate overwintering pests.

In general, it is not that there are no ways to control pests, but that there are many ways. There are pest control tips everywhere; one only fears not searching, not fearing that pests cannot be controlled. If one can study in depth and promote applications, pests are not difficult to control. Each locality can consider the actual situation, find the key, grasp the priorities, and choose more effective methods to implement, without necessarily applying everything. Any prevention and control work, now with politics in command, giving play to the strength of the masses, and combining science and technology, will not be impossible to achieve. Moreover, agriculture across the country has embarked on collectivization, making it easier to arrange prevention and control measures. Over the years, the masses of farmers in various localities have continuously waged a tenacious struggle against various pests, accumulated a lot of experience, and mastered some of the prevention and control techniques. Pest control will be even more convenient in the future. We must try our best to eliminate pest infestations and jointly fight to successfully complete and strive to over fulfill the national agricultural production targets for 1959!

### 为了农业大丰收防虫灭虫要加油  杨惟义代表的发言

专栏：

    为了农业大丰收防虫灭虫要加油
    杨惟义代表的发言
    我完全拥护这次大会中的各项报告。听了周总理的报告后，更使我感到无限的兴奋。我认为我们中央政府，不论是在国内施政方面　或是在国际事务方面，所处理的各项问题，都是很英明的，很主动的，很正确的。我们所走的方向是社会主义的光明大道，我们所做的工作是革命的正义事业，任何帝国主义、反动集团、叛乱分子的诬蔑叫嚣，阴谋捣鬼，都是白费心机的。我们全国人民正是空前无比的密切团结在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，已经是站立起来了，已经是不可再欺侮的了。现在更以无比的干劲，一天等于二十年的速度，蓬蓬勃勃，共同努力，来建设我们伟大的祖国。让帝国主义和反动集团，在我们面前发抖吧！
    在一九五九年的国民经济计划中，关于农业方面：粮食要达到一万零五百亿斤，棉花要达到一万万担，其他农产都要求有不同程度的增长，这个计划是很积极的。我们满怀信心，认为这是可以做得到，并且是可以超额完成任务的。要想达到这个目的，在技术措施上，那就必须做好“八字宪法”。这个宪法中的每一个字都是不可缺少的。治虫工作，在这个宪法中的“保”字内，亦占着很重要的地位。其他各字，设使都能做好，若是“保”字没有做到家，闹起虫灾，那就糟糕。可见虫害问题，在农业生产战线上是经常要密切注意的。因此，我想借这个机会，来谈谈关于农业害虫的防治。目的是想说明消灭虫灾是有办法的。希望各方，增强信心，努力去干，为争取今年农业全面大丰收而展开对于各种害虫作顽强的斗争。按照农事季节，防治措施，可分为下面三大部分，作扼要的叙述：
    改进农业技术是防虫的有效措施
    一、目前必须结合各项农业技术而进行防治——现届夏季，南方春播，已经结束；北方夏收，为期尚早。全国水旱作物，目下正处在生长发育状态。农事上最要注意的，莫如田间管理。治虫工作，便可结合田间管理和栽培技术等而同时进行。各种害虫的发生，多由不良的农业技术所造成。改进生产技术，便可消灭虫灾于无形。“只有不良的农业技术，没有防治不掉的害虫”。近年来，我从各方面去考察，深深体会到：几乎没有那种耕作方法以及栽培和管理等技术，是不能与治虫工作相结合的。譬如在耕作方面，如能做到精耕细作；任何作物，收割以后，能立即耕耙；水稻能细耘二、三次；棉花能中耕多次兼培土；耕耙兼做除草灭槎，使地面常清洁。这些都是有效的杀虫技术。相反地，如果粗放种植；浅耕不耙；各种作物田地，收获以后，老是不耕；水稻不耘；棉花少铲；其他旱作，都不常去中耕除草；很多耕地，让它荒芜。这样就会经常发生虫灾。其他如排灌施肥等田间管理工作，固是增产所不可缺少的措施，目前必须特别加劲，把它做好。同时，亦是最根本的治虫方法，不能忽视。如能从这方面深入研究，可以找出不少的防治窍门，治虫是极有办法的。事实太多，无法细述，只举一例，可概其余：江西萍乡县，现在是一个无虫县，主要是因为历年来做好农业防治而能得到如此成绩。该县的芦溪人民公社，治虫成绩尤为最好。解放以前，虫灾常重。即以一九四九年来说，该社原有耕作区，每亩粮食受到虫灾的损失，平均就达到七十市斤。从一九五○年起，该公社的原有三十六个合作社，掀起了治虫运动，常结合各项农业技术而进行治虫，虫灾即被消灭。自一九五一年以后，就没有什么虫害，年年不断地得到大量的增产，在江西境内是一个最先进的人民公社。
    创造各种方法消灭虫害
    二、虫多地区，可用药杀——全国各地，害虫最猖獗的时期，一般是在六、七、八三个月。有些地方，如果上面所说的各项农业防治工作，没有做得很好，到了这时，那就不得不打出最后一张王牌，应用药剂，作重点的痛杀。能杀死害虫的化剂如666、滴滴涕、敌百虫1605和1059等，都是很有效的毒药。至于土农药，全国各地，也曾创造了五百多种。例如烟筋、石灰、樟脑油和雷公藤等，都是很有杀虫效果的。如果药剂充足，各处都可以尽量使用，只要预测预报工作做得好，能掌握虫情和施药技术有把握，除治任何害虫，都是没有问题的。现在各种害虫，就快要繁殖起来了，各项药械，应当赶快准备，防患未然。可是现在各项虫药，还不能供应全国广大面积的耕地上，做到大量的普遍使用，只能分配一部分作重点的痛杀。这就不能专门依靠虫药来解决问题，认为没有虫药就不能治虫，虫药不到便束手无策而不想其他办法，这是不一定对的。结合农业防治的方法多得很，有虫药固易治虫，没有虫药，也能治虫。
    消灭过冬害虫是防虫的主要环节
    三、要特别注意消灭过冬害虫——消灭过冬害虫是防治工作中最主要的一个环节。各地应从秋季起，就开始进行，为来年农产创造无虫灾的条件。所用的方法，完全可以结合耕作技术来进行。不论水田或旱地，如能做到没有不经过耕翻而越冬的田地；田中作物的残株、枯枝、败叶、干花和烂果等都能一起搞光；田埂上和田地附近的杂草都能铲掉。这样做，田野间的各种害虫就很不容易能逃过这道鬼门关而可以到次年再大量繁育。在江西方面，由于省内各级党政领导的重视，十年以来，对于这项工作，抓得很紧，不断地扩大秋冬季复种面积，缩小休闲田地，即可减少各种害虫的过冬场所。并且不断地推行三耕（积极秋耕，普遍冬耕和提早春耕）和三光（杂草铲光，休闲田耕光和稻根消灭光）等办法，尤其是冬耕灭虫运动，做得更为普遍，找到害虫躲藏在那里，就消灭在那里。因此，解放以前，认为无法对付的螟灾，已经是克服下去了。由解放前，每年全省受到螟害的总损失，常达百分之二、三十的程度，到了去年，已降低到约不及百分之一。全省粮食的总产量，由一九四九年八十亿斤左右，到了去年，就跃增到二百四十亿斤，为一九四九年的三倍。这样惊人的奇迹，是解放前所梦想不到的。其他棉麦等作物的害虫，都同样显见减少。当然也常结合了一些药剂除治，而应用农业技术防治的面积更为广阔，约占全省耕地总面积的十分之九。这样的证例，全国各地是数不清的。南方注重冬耕灭虫；北方提倡秋耕灭槎；新疆推行秋耕冬灌，道理都是一样，目的都是要消灭过冬的害虫。
    总的来说，防治害虫，不是没有办法而是方法多得很。防治窍门，头头是道，只怕不去找，不怕害虫治不掉。如能深入研究，推广应用，害虫是不难治的。各地可以斟酌实际情况，找关键，抓重点，选择更有效的方法而施行，固不必样样都要应用。任何防治工作，现在有了政治挂帅，发挥群众力量，结合科学技术，是不会做不通的。况且全国农业已经走上公社化，布置防治措施更为容易。各地农民群众，历年来不断地常与各种害虫进行过顽强的斗争，已经积累了不少的经验，并且掌握到一部分的防治技术，今后治虫自更方便。我们必须想尽方法，消灭虫灾，为胜利完成，并争取超额完成一九五九年的全国农业生产指标，而作共同的战斗！
