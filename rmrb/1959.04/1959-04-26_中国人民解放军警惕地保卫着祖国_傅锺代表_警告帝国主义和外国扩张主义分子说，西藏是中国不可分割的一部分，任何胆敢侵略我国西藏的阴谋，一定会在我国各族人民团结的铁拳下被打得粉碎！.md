The Chinese People's Liberation Army Vigilantly Defends the Motherland
Representative Fu Zhong Warns Imperialists and Foreign Expansionists: Tibet is an Inalienable Part of China; Any Conspiracy to Invade Our Tibet Will Surely Be Shattered by the United Iron Fist of All Nationalities of Our Country!

Fellow Representatives:

I fully agree with and support the reports presented at this conference. I would now like to express some opinions on the participation of the army in socialist construction.

1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and inspired by the soaring enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, the Chinese People's Liberation Army followed Chairman Mao's teachings, adhered to and carried forward the glorious tradition that our army is forever a fighting force and a working force. Over the past year, while consolidating national defense, improving combat effectiveness, and striving for a Great Leap Forward in all tasks, our army, together with the people of the whole country, actively participated in socialist construction in all aspects. In production labor, all units highly developed the spirit of revolutionary heroism. From offices to companies, from generals to soldiers, regardless of severe cold or scorching heat, they competed to undertake the most arduous tasks. By closely relying on the leadership of the Party, fully mobilizing the masses, learning from local work experience, and vigorously carrying out the technical innovation movement, our army has achieved certain results in production labor while participating in socialist construction. According to incomplete statistics, the army participated in the construction of more than 20,000 water conservancy projects in 1958. Prominent examples include the Ming Tombs Reservoir in Beijing, the Hun River Irrigation Canal in Liaoning, the Songhua River Embankment in Harbin, the Huangma Reservoir in Nanjing, the Longtan Reservoir in Shaanxi, and the Minglang Reservoir in Kunming. Including participation in these projects, as well as participation in industrial construction, seasonal agricultural labor, and disaster relief, the entire army contributed more than 59 million labor days, nearly doubling the number of labor days the troops participated in production and construction in 1957, and exceeding the army's original target by more than 100%. In terms of industrial production, since the Party Central Committee put forward the slogan of "taking steel as the key link," it has given the officers and soldiers of the entire army great encouragement. All units immediately organized manpower and material resources to engage in mining, coking, iron smelting, and steelmaking. In addition, the Air Force dispatched aircraft, the Navy dispatched warships, and the various units mobilized more than 8,800 trucks, running day and night on the steel transportation lines to support steel production.

During the Great Leap Forward in our country in 1958, a new social organization emerged, namely the People's Commune. Like the people of the whole country, the officers and soldiers of our army expressed joy and enthusiastic support for the birth of the People's Commune.

Experience has proven that it is necessary and possible for the army to participate in socialist construction with a certain amount of time and strength during peacetime. The army's participation in production labor not only contributes to the country's socialist construction but is also conducive to the army's construction. Through production labor, officers and soldiers can strengthen their political training, enhance their labor concepts and communist awareness, and acquire necessary production knowledge and production technology, becoming revolutionary soldiers who have both combat skills and production skills. At the same time, it can also enhance friendship and unity with the people, and draw inexhaustible and inexhaustible inspiring power from the people.

In order to enable the troops to better participate in socialist construction, in January of this year, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army issued the "Outline for the Army's Participation in Socialist Construction" and the "Instructions on the Army's Participation in Industrial and Agricultural Production." These two documents require all units to spend one to two months each year participating in production labor. In terms of participating in local industrial and agricultural production, the focus is on participating in basic construction such as farmland water conservancy, factories, and enterprises, concentrating efforts to help people's communes gradually realize commune industrialization, agricultural mechanization, and electrification. In terms of internal production within the army, it is generally based on agricultural and sideline production, gradually realizing the majority or all of the self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables, in order to improve the lives of the troops and reduce the country's supply to the army. In addition, all units in the troops with technical equipment, on the premise of absolutely ensuring the completion of military production tasks and teaching tasks, accept local processing orders, repairs and manufacturing, and production tasks for a part of civilian products, as much as possible. The promulgation of these two documents has quickly received enthusiastic response from the entire army. Since the beginning of spring this year, all units of the army have formulated specific plans for participating in socialist construction in accordance with the spirit of the Outline, and have promptly投入(tóurù) themselves into the vigorous industrial and agricultural production labor during the intervals of training. The troops in the Shenyang area alone have invested in 90 key construction projects. These include three large-scale projects such as the Tiefa Railway (Tieling to Faku), the Qinghe Reservoir, and the Shenyang Railway Hub Station. While defending national defense, the troops on the Fujian front have also drawn a large amount of manpower to actively participate in spring plowing production and fertilizer accumulation campaigns. It is currently the fishing season, and the coastal troops are protecting fishing while helping people's communes with the rush of spring plowing. On the Tibetan Plateau, in the Qinghai-Xinjiang Basin, and on the coastal islands, there are also People's Liberation Army soldiers participating in production and construction. It can be expected that under the leadership of the local Party committees, and with the care and assistance of the people of the whole country, our army will surely achieve new achievements in performing the glorious tasks of socialist defenders and socialist builders.

Here, I would like to say a few more words about the Tibet issue. Since our army entered Tibet on October 26, 1951, in accordance with the instructions of the Central People's Government, it has always strictly abided by and implemented the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet between the Central People's Government and the local government of Tibet. Even when the rebel bandits were constantly provoking our army, attacking our army's garrison points and lines, and assassinating our army's personnel on duty, our army still took the overall situation into account and tried its best to be patient, hoping that the rebel bandits would repent. However, our army's tolerant and repeatedly patient approach was regarded by the former local government of Tibet and the upper-class reactionary group as weak and deceitful. They actually launched a full-scale armed rebellion on March 10. Under such circumstances, in order to safeguard the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities, and to rescue the people of Tibet from their suffering, our army obeyed the order of the State Council and launched a campaign of suppression. Now, as everyone knows, the armed rebellion launched by the former local government of Tibet and the upper-class reactionary group has been quickly crushed. So far, our army has controlled the vast area south of the Yarlung Zangbo River and north of the Himalayas, and all the border defense strongholds in this area. Only a small number of scattered bandits have fled into remote mountainous areas, and our army is continuing to pursue and wipe them out. In the operation to quell the rebellion, our army's policy towards the rebels is also lenient: those who abandon the bandits and return are not held accountable for their past deeds; those who have made meritorious contributions are rewarded; all prisoners are treated leniently, without killing or humiliation, without beating, and without searching their pockets; only those who are stubborn and resistant are severely punished. At the same time, our army strictly implemented the Party's policy of national unity and the policy of freedom of religious belief. Wherever we went, we maintained strict discipline and did not take a single needle or thread from the masses. During the intervals of combat, we also helped the masses with spring plowing and planting, moving the Tibetan people to burn incense and kowtow, and vying to spread the word: "The Bodhisattva soldiers sent by Chairman Mao have arrived!" As a Tibetan folk song sings: "The tears of previous years cannot be exhausted, the mountain songs of this year cannot be sung enough, our People's Liberation Army has arrived, and we see the blue sky after parting the clouds and mists." Our army's quelling of the rebellion and the celebration of their new life by the one million Tibetan people are entirely our own national affairs. But strangely, the imperialists and foreign expansionists, completely disregarding the historical fact that Tibet has been our country's territory since ancient times, have turned black into white, confused right and wrong, and slandered our country. This interference in our internal affairs and attempt to undermine our national unity is extremely infuriating. We should once again warn the imperialists and foreign expansionists that Tibet is an inalienable part of China; any conspiracy to invade our Tibet will surely be shattered by the united iron fist of all nationalities of our country. The Chinese people do not want an inch of foreign land, but they will never let others take an inch of their land. At the same time, we should once again warn the rebels who are fleeing in remote mountainous areas: if they do not quickly lay down their weapons and abandon darkness to follow the light, they will be thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminated; if they flee to India, that is also a dead end.

Fellow Representatives: 1959 is a year of continued Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction. The 1959 national economic plan to be adopted at this meeting is a magnificent Great Leap Forward plan. Our entire army will make its greatest effort to strengthen the construction of a modern revolutionary army, vigilantly defend the motherland, and, together with the people of the whole country, strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan.

    中国人民解放军警惕地保卫着祖国
    傅锺代表　警告帝国主义和外国扩张主义分子说，西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，任何胆敢侵略我国西藏的阴谋，一定会在我国各族人民团结的铁拳下被打得粉碎！各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护这次大会上的几个报告。我现在仅就军队参加社会主义建设问题发表一点意见。
    一九五八年，是我国社会主义建设大跃进的一年。中国人民解放军在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国人民冲天干劲的鼓舞下，遵循着毛主席的教导，坚持和发扬了我军永远是战斗队又是工作队的光荣传统。一年来，我军在巩固国防、提高战斗力和力争各项工作大跃进的同时，也和全国人民一起，从各方面积极参加了社会主义建设。在生产劳动中，各部队高度发扬了革命英雄主义精神，从机关到连队，从将军到士兵，不分严寒酷暑，争相担负最艰巨的任务。由于紧紧依靠了党的领导，充分发动了群众，学习了地方工作经验，大力开展了技术革新运动，从而使我军在参加社会主义建设的生产劳动中，获得了一定成绩。据不完全统计，全军一九五八年参加修建的水利工程共有两万多项，举其大者，如北京的十三陵水库，辽宁的浑河灌溉渠，哈尔滨的松花江大堤，南京的黄马水库，陕西的龙潭水库，昆明的明朗水库等。参加这些项目的劳动，连同参加工业建设、农业季节性劳动、抢险救灾等，全军共计付出了五千九百多万个劳动日，比一九五七年部队参加生产建设的劳动日增加了近两倍，超过了全军原订指标一倍以上。在工业生产方面，自从党中央提出了“以钢为纲”的生产号召后，更给了全军官兵以极大的鼓舞，各部队立即组织人力、物力，从事采矿、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢。此外，空军还派出了飞机，海军出动了舰艇，各部队抽调了八千八百多台汽车，日夜不停地奔驰在钢铁运输线上，支援了钢铁生产。
    在我国一九五八年的大跃进中，出现了一个新的社会组织，这就是人民公社。我军官兵和全国人民的心情一样，对人民公社的诞生，表示欢欣鼓舞和热烈拥护。
    经验证明，军队在和平时期，以一定的时间和力量参加社会主义建设，是必要的和可能的。军队参加生产劳动，不仅有助于国家社会主义建设，而且也有利于军队建设。通过生产劳动，可以使军官和士兵从政治上加强锻炼，提高劳动观念和共产主义觉悟，获得必要的生产知识和生产技术，成为既有战斗技能又有生产技能的革命军人；同时，还可以增进与人民群众的友谊团结，并从人民群众中吸取到取之不尽、用之不竭的鼓舞力量。
    为了使部队更好地参加社会主义建设，今年一月，人民解放军总政治部颁发了“军队参加社会主义建设工作纲要”和“军队参加工农业生产的指示”。这两个文件要求各部队每年以一至两个月的时间参加生产劳动。在参加地方工农业生产方面，着重于参加农田水利、工厂企业等基本建设，集中力量帮助人民公社逐步实现公社工业化，农业机械化、电气化。在军队内部生产方面，一般以农副业生产为主，逐步实现肉类、蔬菜大部或全部自给，以改善部队生活，减少国家对军队的供应。此外，部队中一切具有技术设备的单位，在绝对保证完成军事生产任务和教学任务的前提下，都按照可能，接受地方加工订货、修理制造及一部分民用产品的生产任务。这两个文件的公布，已迅速得到全军的热烈响应。今年开春以来，全军各部队已根据纲要的精神，制定了参加社会主义建设的具体规划，并利用训练的间隙，及时投入了热火朝天的工农业生产劳动。仅沈阳地区部队就投入了九十项重点工程建设。其中包括铁法铁路（铁岭到法库）、清河水库、沈阳铁路枢纽站等三项规模较大的工程。福建前线部队在保卫国防的同时，也抽出了大批人力，积极参加了春耕生产和积肥运动。目前正是渔汛季节，沿海部队正一面护渔，一面帮助人民公社突击春耕。在西藏高原，在青（海）新（疆）盆地，在沿海岛屿，也都有人民解放军在参加生产建设。可以预期，在各地党委的领导下，在全国人民的关怀和帮助下，我军在执行社会主义保卫者和社会主义建设者的光荣任务方面，一定会取得新的成就。
    这里，我想就西藏问题再说几句话。自从一九五一年十月二十六日我军根据中央人民政府的指示进驻西藏以后，是一向严格遵守和执行了中央人民政府与西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议的。即使处在叛乱分子不断向我军挑衅、袭击我军驻守的点线和暗害我军外出人员的情况下，我军也是以大局为重，尽量加以忍让，希望叛乱分子能够有所悔悟。可是，我军这种宽大为怀，一再忍让的做法，反而被原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团认为是软弱可欺，他们居然于三月十日发动了全面的武装叛乱。在这种情况下，为了维护祖国的统一和民族团结，解救西藏地区人民的疾苦，我军遵照国务院的命令，这才兴师讨伐。现在，正如大家所知道的，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱，已经被迅速粉碎了，到目前为止，我军已控制了雅鲁藏布江以南、喜马拉雅山以北的广大地区和这个地区的所有边境国防要点，叛匪只剩下为数很少的一些零散小股，窜入偏僻山区，我军正在继续加以清剿。在平叛作战中，我军对待叛乱分子的政策也是宽大的，即：凡脱离叛匪来归者，一概不咎既往；有立功表现者，给予奖励；对俘虏一律优待，不杀不辱，不打，不搜腰包；只有对执迷不悟、坚持顽抗的，才严惩不贷。同时我军又严格地执行了党的民族团结政策和宗教信仰自由政策，所到之处，纪律严明，不拿群众一针一线，在战斗间隙里，还帮助群众春耕播种，感动得藏民焚香顶礼，争相传告：“毛主席派来的菩萨兵到了！”正如一首西藏民歌所歌颂的：“往年的眼泪流不尽，今年的山歌唱不完，来了我们的人民解放军，拨开云雾见青天。”我军平定叛乱和西藏一百十几万人民欢庆他们的新生，这些完全是我们国家自己的事情。可是令人奇怪的是，帝国主义者和外国扩张主义分子，却完全不顾从古以来西藏就是我国领土的历史事实，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，对我国大肆诬蔑，这种干涉我国内政和企图破坏我国统一的行为，是令人十分愤慨的。我们应该再一次警告帝国主义者和外国扩张主义分子，西藏是中国不可分割的一部分；任何胆敢侵略我国西藏的阴谋，一定会在我国各族人民团结的铁拳下被打得粉碎。中国人民不要任何外国一寸土地，但是也决不让别人抢走一寸土地。同时我们也应该再一次警告流窜在偏僻山区的叛乱分子：他们如不迅速放下武器，弃暗投明，就将被彻底、干净、全部消灭；他们逃亡到印度去，那也只是绝路一条。
    各位代表：一九五九年，是我国社会主义建设继续大跃进的一年。在这次会议上将要通过的一九五九年国民经济计划，是一个宏伟的大跃进的计划。我们全军将以最大努力，加强现代化革命军队建设，警惕地保卫祖国，并和全国人民一道，为完成和超额完成一九五九年国民经济计划而奋斗。
