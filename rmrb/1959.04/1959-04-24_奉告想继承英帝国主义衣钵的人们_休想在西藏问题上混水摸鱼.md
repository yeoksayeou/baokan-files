Speech by Representative Cheng Qian

Fellow Representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and other reports. The "Government Work Report" comprehensively summarizes the brilliant achievements, great significance, and rich experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and puts forward the main tasks and policies for developing the national economy in 1959. The 1959 plan for developing the national economy, centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, is a grand leap forward plan. To mobilize and organize the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life across the country, unite all forces that can be united, and mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized, work hard, and go all out to complete and overfulfill this plan is the most glorious and urgent political task of the Chinese people. (Applause)

Greedy imperialist and expansionist elements are the masterminds behind the Tibetan rebellion. They do not judge the hour, assess their virtues, or measure their strength, and vainly attempt to gain some advantage on the Tibet issue, only to find their wishes unfulfilled and their ugly faces more deeply exposed.

The original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, instigated by imperialists, painstakingly betrayed the motherland, undermined unity, and did not hesitate to resort to sinful means to launch an open armed rebellion. The Central People's Government took wise and resolute measures to quickly quell the rebellion, which not only conformed to the interests and wishes of the 1.2 million Tibetan people, but also conformed to the interests and wishes of the 650 million people of the whole country. We believe that the sacred unity of our country, formed historically by all ethnic groups, must not be allowed to be undermined; the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, including relations between ethnic groups, can be discussed and resolved by ourselves, and no foreigners are allowed to interfere or meddle; reactionary, backward, cruel, and tyrannical socio-political systems must not be allowed to be maintained for a long time. Our fervent sympathy is poured out to the vast Tibetan working people who are at the bottom and suffer greatly, and to the Tibetan monks and laypeople who pursue progress and love the motherland. The objective laws of historical development cannot be resisted, and the future of all ethnic groups in the world, including the future of the Tibetan people, can only be socialism and communism; the reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries of Tibet will, after a historical period, along with their "sacred and beautiful" serf system, be reduced to extinction and death. And the great Tibetan people, in the socialist family of the motherland, will create and build a prosperous and happy life with their noble labor. (Warm applause)

At present, there are some imperialist and expansionist elements in the world who are opening their greedy wolf mouths and still want to drink other people's blood and suck other people's fat. On the Tibet issue, they played the role of mastermind, doing everything possible to instigate, manipulate, incite, and provoke. However, people can see very clearly that their own lives are not easy, and their actions, including those on the Tibet issue, cannot save them from their fate of decline and death; their attempt to gain some "advantage" on the Tibet issue can only be contrary to their wishes and counterproductive, only to more deeply expose their ugly faces in front of the people of the world, making themselves more isolated. At present, there are also some people in the world who do not judge the hour, assess their virtues, or measure their strength, but have ulterior motives. They are "blinded by a leaf and cannot see Mount Tai," unable or unwilling to see the changes in the overall world situation, unable or unwilling to see the great changes in the People's Republic of China. They have published all kinds of absurd fallacies on the Tibet issue. They want to inherit the legacy of British imperialism, stretch their hands very long, and cannot help but try to muddy the waters on the Tibet issue. Here, we want to solemnly advise these people: sinister motives will never succeed, and the attempt to muddy the waters will always be a beautiful soap bubble. (Applause) The people of our countries are friendly to each other, and our countries are also friendly to each other. Different socio-political systems can coexist peacefully. The strength of the People's Republic of China supports all national independent countries that oppose imperialism, making them stand up more bravely, hold their heads high, and strive for progress. The "Yellow Peril" theory is a slanderous rumor created by imperialism. The strength and prosperity of our country is only detrimental to imperialism, and does not harm any country or anyone else. We have not, do not, and will not interfere in any internal affairs of any country. However, if anyone is still indulging in wishful thinking, not judging the hour, and wants to make a fuss on the Tibet issue, then they will soon find themselves in a dilemma and a very embarrassing situation. The development of objective facts will eventually move towards the opposite of subjective wishful thinking, and by then, even the so-called smartest politicians will regret it too late. (Warm applause)

The great victory of 1958 will be recorded in the history of our country with brilliant and dazzling chapters. All the slanders and smears of the imperialist elements only reveal a truth: the things we "love and want to live" are the things they must "hate and want to die."

1958 was a year of Great Leap Forward, great harvest, and great victory. The great achievements of this year will be recorded in the history of our country with brilliant and dazzling chapters. In this year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and under the guidance of the general line of building socialism, the people of our country worked hard and created unprecedented achievements. The great achievements on the industrial and agricultural fronts and the cultural and educational fronts, the victorious realization of the people's commune movement in the rural areas across the country, the significant improvement of the ideological awareness of the people across the country, and the great improvement of the people's living standards are the most basic signs of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The imperialists, their echo bugs, and the political commentators and lobbyists they employ are most dissatisfied and most afraid of the victorious realization of our Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement. As Premier Zhou's report pointed out, they are very afraid that "this fact will inevitably enhance the belief of the people of the world in the superiority of socialism and deepen people's doubts about the capitalist system." The imperialist elements say that we are conducting "human wave tactics," forcing "slave labor," "uniform" living standards, "destroying families," "impacting ethical concepts," and that the Chinese are like a group of "ants wearing blue clothes," and so on. We believe that all these slanders and smears only reveal one truth: the imperialists will never have a common language with us, and the things we "love and want to live" are the things they must "hate and want to die." As negative teachers, the imperialists have told us that we must continue the Great Leap Forward, and we must rectify, consolidate, and improve the people's communes. If we pool our efforts, unite as one, fight with high spirits, and realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward this year, and further rectify, consolidate, and improve the people's communes, it will be like giving the imperialists a resounding slap in the face, greatly enhancing our own morale and greatly diminishing the enemy's prestige. (Applause)

The magnificent plan for developing the national economy in 1959, centered on the four major indicators, is a positive and reliable plan, and it is also a plan that must be realized through arduous labor. Chairman Mao Zedong has repeatedly educated us: strategically, we must despise difficulties, and tactically, we must pay attention to difficulties. This means that we must establish great ambitions, embrace lofty aspirations, overcome difficulties with a spirit of dauntlessness, and resolutely achieve the planned targets; at the same time, we must boost our morale, increase measures, avoid boasting and arrogance, carry out our work meticulously, overcome specific difficulties one by one, and overfulfill the planned targets. We believe that with the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the correct guidance of the general line, the material foundation and rich experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the ever-increasing labor enthusiasm of the masses of the people, the solid unity of the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life across the country, and the people's commune, an organization with great superiority and strong vitality, we will certainly be able to realize the magnificent plan for developing the national economy this year.

Fellow Representatives: We are holding a meeting of unity and a meeting of leap forward here. Looking forward to tomorrow, each of us has a spirit of revolutionary optimism and a firm belief in winning victory. Let us hold high the red banner of continuing the leap forward, unite the people of the whole country, break through thorns and overcome all difficulties, and move forward boldly with giant strides. (Prolonged warm applause)

    奉告想继承英帝国主义衣钵的人们
    休想在西藏问题上混水摸鱼
    程潜代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和其它各项报告。“政府工作报告”全面地总结了一九五八年大跃进的辉煌成就、伟大意义和丰富经验，并且提出了一九五九年发展国民经济的主要任务和方针。以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的一九五九年发展国民经济计划，是一个宏伟的跃进计划。动员和组织全国各族各界人民，团结一切可以团结的力量，调动一切能够调动的积极因素，艰苦奋斗，全力以赴，完成和超额完成这个计划，是我国人民最光荣、最迫切的政治任务。（鼓掌）
    贪婪的帝国主义分子和扩张主义分子是西藏叛乱的幕后主持人。他们不审时不度德、不量力，妄想在西藏问题上讨点便宜，结果只能事与愿违，更深刻地暴露他们的丑恶面貌
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，受帝国主义者的唆使，处心积虑背叛祖国，破坏统一，不惜采取罪恶的手段，发动了公开的武装叛乱。中央人民政府采取英明坚决的措施，迅速敉平叛乱，这不但符合一百二十万西藏人民的利益和愿望，而且符合六亿五千万全国人民的利益和愿望。我们认为，各民族从历史上形成的我们国家的神圣统一，决不容许破坏；中华人民共和国的内部事务，包括各民族之间的关系，可以由自己商量解决和调整，决不容许任何外人干涉和染指；反动的、落后的、残酷的、暴虐的社会政治制度，决不容许长期保留。我们的热切的同情心，倾注于身处底层、备受苦痛的广大藏族劳动人民，倾注于追求进步、热爱祖国的藏族僧俗人民。历史发展的客观规律无法抗拒，全世界各民族人民的未来，包括西藏人民的未来，只能是社会主义和共产主义；西藏的反动派和反革命派，在一个历史时期之后，将和他们的“神圣的、美丽的”农奴制度一起，归于消灭和死亡。而伟大的西藏人民，在社会主义的祖国大家庭里，则将以自己的崇高劳动，缔造和建设繁荣幸福的生活。（热烈鼓掌）
    现时世界上有一些帝国主义分子和扩张主义分子，他们张开贪婪的狼嘴，还想喝别人的血，吮别人的脂膏。在西藏问题上，他们扮演了幕后主持人的角色，极尽怂恿、摆布、嗾使、挑拨之能事。但是，人们看得很清楚，他们自己的日子很不好过，他们的作为，包括在西藏问题上的作为，并不能挽救他们的日落西山的死亡命运；他们想在西藏问题上讨点“便宜”，结果也只能事与愿违，适得其反，只不过是在全世界人民面前更深刻地暴露自己的丑恶面貌，使自己更加孤立而已。现时世界上也还有一些不审时、不度德、不量力、但是居心不良的人，他们“一叶障眼，不识泰山”，看不见或不愿看见整个世界形势的变化，看不见或不愿看见中华人民共和国的伟大变化，他们对西藏问题发表了形形色色的荒谈谬论，他们想继承英帝国主义的遗策，手伸得很长，情不自禁，企图在西藏问题上混水摸鱼。在这里，我们想严肃地奉劝这些人们：不良的居心永远不能得逞，搅混水摸鱼的企图永远是一个美丽的肥皂泡。（鼓掌）我们各国的人民之间是友好的，我们的国家相互之间也是友好的，不同的社会政治制度是完全可以和平共处的。中华人民共和国的强大，为一切反对帝国主义的民族主义独立国家撑腰，使他们更加勇敢地站立起来，扬眉吐气，奋发图强。“黄祸”之说，是帝国主义的造谣中伤。我们国家的强大兴隆，仅仅对帝国主义不利，除此以外，丝毫不伤害任何国家和任何人。我们过去、现在、将来都不会干预任何国家的任何内部事务。但是，如果有人还在痴心妄想，不审时度德，想在西藏问题上做什么文章，那么，他们就会很快地发现自己陷入了一种进退维谷、十分狼狈的境地。客观事实的发展，终归要走向主观妄想的反面，到那时，就是所谓最聪明的政治家也将后悔莫及。（热烈鼓掌）
    一九五八年的大胜利将以光辉耀眼的篇章，载入我们国家的史册。帝国主义分子的一切诽谤和诬蔑，只是说破一个真理：我们“爱之欲其生”的事物，他们一定“恶之欲其死”
    一九五八年是大跃进、大丰收、大胜利的一年。这一年的伟大成就，将以光辉耀眼的篇章，载入我们国家的史册。这一年，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在建设社会主义的总路线的指导下，我国人民艰苦奋斗，创造了史无前例的成绩。工农业战线和文化教育战线的伟大战果，人民公社化运动在全国农村的胜利实现，全国人民思想觉悟的显著提高，人民生活的大大改善，是一九五八年大跃进的最基本的标志。帝国主义者、它们的应声虫以及他们所雇佣的政论家和说客，最不满意同时也最害怕我们的大跃进和人民公社化运动的胜利实现。正如周总理的报告所指出的，他们十分害怕“这个事实不可免地要增强全世界人民对于社会主义优越性的信念，加深人们对于资本主义制度的怀疑”。帝国主义分子说我们这里进行“人海战术”，强迫从事“奴隶劳动”，“清一色”的生活水平，“毁坏家庭”“冲击伦理观念”，说中国人象一群“穿着蓝衣服的蚂蚁”，如此等等。我们认为，所有这些诽谤和污蔑，只是说破了一个真理：帝国主义者永远和我们没有共同语言，凡是我们“爱之欲其生”的事物，帝国主义者一定“恶之欲其死”。作为反面教员，帝国主义者倒是告诉了我们：必须继续大跃进，必须整顿、巩固和提高人民公社。如果我们群策群力，万众一心，斗志昂扬，意气风发，实现了今年更大更好更全面的大跃进，进一步整顿、巩固和提高了人民公社，那就等于给帝国主义者一记响亮的耳光，就会大长自己的志气，大灭敌人的威风。（鼓掌）
    以四大指标为中心的一九五九年的宏伟的发展国民经济计划，是一个积极可靠的计划，同时也是一个必须付出艰巨劳动才能实现的计划。毛泽东主席反复教育我们：战略上要藐视困难，战术上要重视困难。这就是说，我们必须立雄心，抱壮志，以大无畏的精神战胜困难，坚决实现计划指标；同时，又必须鼓干劲，加措施，力戒浮夸骄傲，细致地进行工作，逐个地战胜具体困难，超额完成计划指标。我们相信：有中国共产党的英明领导，有总路线的正确指引，有1958年大跃进的物质基础和丰富经验，有人民群众继长增高的劳动热情，有全国各族各界人民的巩固团结，有人民公社这种具有伟大优越性和强大生命力的组织，我们一定能够实现今年的发展国民经济的宏伟计划。
    各位代表：我们在这里举行团结的大会，跃进的大会。展望明天，我们每一个人都怀着革命乐观主义的精神，抱着夺取胜利的坚强信念。让我们高举继续跃进的红旗，团结全国人民，披荆斩棘，排除万难，以巨人式的步伐豪迈前进。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
