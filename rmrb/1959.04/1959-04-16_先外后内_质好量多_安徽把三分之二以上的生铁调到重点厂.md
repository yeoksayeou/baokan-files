Prioritizing External Needs, Quality First, Quantity Abundant
Anhui Transfers Over Two-Thirds of Pig Iron to Key Factories

　　Hefei, April 15th (report from our newspaper) - Anhui Province has transferred over two-thirds of the iron produced in the first quarter to support key enterprises in Shanghai and other places. In three months, the province transferred a total of more than 250,000 tons of pig iron, equivalent to 59.3% of the total iron transferred last year. Among them, 200,921 tons were transferred to Shanghai, accounting for more than half of the iron transferred in the East China cooperation region. The quality of pig iron transferred to Shanghai had a qualification rate of 93% to 95%. As of April 14th, another 34,000 tons have been transferred.

　　Leaders at all levels in Anhui Province have conscientiously implemented the principle of "the whole country as a single chessboard." For iron usage within the province, the Provincial Planning Commission uniformly issues iron usage figures each month according to the spirit of prioritizing external needs over internal, and key projects over general ones. Iron cannot be used outside the scope approved by the Provincial Planning Commission. The pig iron required by each steel plant is supplied according to actual needs.

　　Many steel plants are trying their best to ensure the quality of pig iron transferred externally. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee organ steel plant has adopted methods such as using quicklime instead of limestone as a flux to reduce the sulfur content of the iron. Currently, the sulfur content of pig iron has been reduced to below 0.2%, meeting the requirements for steelmaking. In terms of transportation, all regions pay attention to transferring good iron to support key areas. The Hefei Pig Iron Transfer Station, which is responsible for the unified transfer of pig iron in the city, not only checks the quantity of pig iron transferred externally from each factory, but also checks the quality. If poor-quality iron is found, it is not allowed to be transferred externally.

　　The Anhui Provincial Party Committee has proposed the method of "producing, concentrating, and transferring externally simultaneously," so that the province's pig iron external transfer gradually achieves balanced transportation and timely supply to key areas. Every steel plant not only cares about production but also cares about external transfer. They promptly notify the pig iron transfer station of the quantity of iron produced and prepare for the transfer. For example, the Provincial Party Committee organ steel plant weighs the molten iron after it is tapped and cooled, and stores it in piles according to the carrying capacity of the railway cars, waiting for external transfer. After the pig iron transfer station understands the iron storage situation of each factory, it notifies the transportation department to prepare vehicles to concentrate the pig iron of each factory to the transfer station. For steel plants requiring short-distance transportation, transport vehicles bring ore and coke into the factory and return pig iron to the station. This shortens the inventory time. The average inventory time for pig iron in Anhui Province was 4.8 days in January, 3.4 days in February, and 3.1 days in March.

### 先外后内　质好量多  安徽把三分之二以上的生铁调到重点厂

　　先外后内　质好量多
　　安徽把三分之二以上的生铁调到重点厂
    本报合肥15日电　安徽省把第一季度所产生铁的三分之二以上外调支援上海等地重点企业。三个月内，全省共调出生铁二十五万多吨，相当于去年全年调铁数字的59.3％。其中调上海二十万零九千二百一十吨，占华东协作地区调铁数字的一半以上。调上海生铁的质量，合格率为93％到95％。到4月14日为止，又已调出三万四千多吨。
    安徽省各级领导都认真执行了“全国一盘棋”方针。省内用铁，每月由省计划委员会根据先外后内、先重点后一般精神，统一下达用铁数字，不在省计委批准用铁范围内的，不能动用。各钢厂所需用的生铁，按实际需用供应。
    很多钢铁厂都想尽办法保证外调生铁的质量。安徽省委机关钢铁厂，采用生石灰代替石灰石做熔剂等办法，降低铁的含硫量，目前生铁含硫量已降低到0.2％以下，达到炼钢要求。在调运上，各地都注意把好铁调出支援重点，负责统一调运全市生铁的合肥市生铁转运站，不仅负责检查各厂外调生铁的数字，而且也检查质量，发现不好的铁，不予外调。
    中共安徽省委提出了“边生产，边集中，边外调”的办法，使全省生铁外调逐渐做到均衡调运，及时供应重点。各个钢铁厂不仅做到关心生产，而且关心外调。他们把生产铁的数字都及时通知生铁转运站，并作好调铁的准备工作。如省委机关钢铁厂，在铁水出炉冷却后就过秤，按车皮载重量分堆存放，等待外调。生铁转运站了解各厂存铁情况后，通知运输部门准备车辆，把各厂生铁集中到转运站，凡需要短途运输的钢铁厂，运输车都做到了带矿石、焦炭进厂，带生铁回站。这样就缩短了库存时间。安徽全省1月份生铁库存时间平均为四点八天，2月份为三点四天，3月份为三点一天。
