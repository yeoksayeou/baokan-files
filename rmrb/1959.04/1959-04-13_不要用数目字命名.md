　　Do Not Use Numerical Names
    In the countryside, I often come across various numerical names. For example, pesticides include "1605" and "1059"; rice varieties include "10509" and "II-49-79"; wheat includes "Nanda 2419," "Jinda 2905," and "Jinda 4197," and so on. Countless other crops have similar names. These names are difficult for farmers to remember, and even agricultural technicians have trouble remembering them at times.
    Most numerical names are created by taking the variety's experimental number and using it without modification or with the addition of one or two characters. These names have no meaning and are dull and difficult to remember. Sometimes the pronunciations are similar, and farmers often misremember and confuse them. For example, with pesticides "1605" and "1059," mistakes in the name have led to incorrect dilution concentrations during application in some areas, causing unnecessary losses.
    China's vocabulary is very rich. Why not use rich characters for naming, instead of using dull numbers? During the Great Leap Forward, new varieties were cultivated and new products emerged like mushrooms after rain. We hope that the naming of new varieties and new products will preferably use distinctive, meaningful, easy-to-remember, and understandable characters. Using numbers as names is not very popular with the masses. I don't know if the above suggestions are correct, I offer them for everyone's reference.

### 不要用数目字命名

　　不要用数目字命名
    我在农村中，常常碰到各种各样的数字名称。像农药就有“1605”、“1059”；水稻品种有什么“10509”、“Ⅱ—49—79”之类；小麦有“南大2419”、“金大2905”、“金大4197”等等。其他作物类似这样名称的不胜枚举。这些名称，莫说农民难记，就连农业技术干部一时也难以记住。
    用数字命的名称，大多数是把试验时品种的编号，不加修改或略加一、二个字而成的。这种名称既没有什么意义，又干巴巴的难以记忆。有时有的字音相近，农民往往记不住而混淆不清。像农药“1605”与“1059”，由于记错名字，有的地方用药时把稀释的浓度搞错，造成不应有的损失。
    中国的词汇是非常丰富的，为什么不用丰富的文字来命名，而用干巴巴的数字来命名呢？在大跃进中，新品种的育成、新产品的出现像雨后春笋一般。我们希望新品种、新产品的命名，最好能采用有特色、含意深、易于记忆和叫人懂得的文字。用数目字来作名称，是不大受群众欢迎的。以上意见不知是否正确，提出来供大家参考。
