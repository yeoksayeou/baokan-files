　　Snowy Night

　　One night in January of this year, it was already past 11 o'clock. The weather suddenly changed dramatically, with strong winds and heavy snow. At this time, Guo Hongyu, a female commune member of the Heping Brigade of the Chengjiao People's Commune in Guyuan County, couldn't sleep because of the howling wind. She thought: Are the livestock sheds properly secured? Now is the critical time for preparing for spring plowing, and if the livestock freeze, it will directly affect production. So, she quickly got out of bed, put on her clothes, pushed open the door, and ran straight to the livestock farm.

　　When she got there, she saw that the fence of the livestock pen had been blown open by the strong wind. Some of the cattle and donkeys had run outside the pen, and the livestock inside were also constantly being attacked by the wind and snow. At that time, it was pitch dark, with wind and snow交加 (jiāojiā - coming together, both at the same time), Guo Hongyu braved the wind and groped in the dark, fearlessly driving the livestock outside back into the pen, tying them up with ropes, and then repairing the pen. By the time she had finished everything, she was shivering from the cold.

　　Since Guo Hongyu became the brigade's livestock keeper last year, she has been carefully raising the livestock like a nanny caring for children. Every night, she always makes sure that the livestock are fed well and have rested before she goes back to sleep. As a result, the livestock she feeds are all fat and strong. Last winter, Guo Hongyu was also selected as a representative to the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Women's Activists Congress.

### 风雪之夜

　　风雪之夜
    今年元月的一个夜晚，已经是十一点多钟了。气候忽然大变，刮大风，下大雪。这时，固原县城郊人民公社和平大队的女社员郭红玉，听到风的呼啸声，再也睡不着了，她想：这么大的风雪，牲畜棚挡好了没有？现在正是备耕紧急关头，牲畜冻坏了就会直接影响生产。于是，她连忙从炕上爬起来，披上衣服，推开房门，一口气直跑到牲畜饲养场。
    到那里一看，牲畜圈的栅栏已经被大风刮开，有的牛和毛驴跑到畜圈外边，里边的牲畜也不时的受着风雪的袭击。当时，天色漆黑，风雪交加，郭红玉顶风摸黑，奋不顾身，把外面的牲畜赶进畜圈，用绳子拴好，然后又搭好畜圈。等她把一切弄好，已经冻得直发抖。
    郭红玉自去年担任社里的饲养员以来，一直像保姆保育孩子一样细心地饲养牲畜，每天晚上总要先看着牲畜吃饱、吃好，休息以后，自己才肯回去睡觉。因此她喂的牲畜个个膘肥体壮。去年冬天，郭红玉还被选为宁夏回族自治区妇女积极分子代表大会的代表。
