Has the American Economic Crisis Passed?
Yuan Wen

I.

The cyclical economic crisis that began in the United States in August 1957, after a sharp decline, has rebounded significantly since April of last year. The industrial production index has risen from 126 in April of last year to 144 in February of this year, only 2 points lower than the peak before the crisis in 1957 (December 1956), meaning it has recovered 90% of the decline. However, the recovery in production is unbalanced. The light industrial sector, which manufactures non-durable goods and has been stagnant for many years, saw its production index increase to 138 in February of this year, exceeding the pre-crisis peak (132 in August 1957). Meanwhile, durable goods, mainly heavy industry, increased to 155, recovering only 70% of the decline and still 5.5% lower than the pre-crisis peak. Important sectors, such as steel production, are still down 9%, automobiles down 10%, and machine manufacturing down 17%.

The main reason for the recovery in American industrial production is the government's vigorous adoption of artificial measures; at the same time, monopoly enterprises have tightened production, exceeding the decline in market demand, i.e., adopting a method of partial destruction of production.

(1) The government's massive increase in spending and easing of credit and other measures played a major stimulating role. Federal government spending for fiscal year 1959 (the year beginning last July) has increased to $80.9 billion, an increase of $9 billion over the previous year; of which military spending increased by $2 billion (including atomic energy and military aid, totaling $46.1 billion), and non-military spending on agriculture, residential construction, and public works increased by a total of $7 billion. Including state and local governments, total budget spending for this year is $125 billion, an increase of $12 billion over fiscal year 1958. The proportion of total government spending in the gross national product has increased from 26% to 28%. This is the year with the largest budget increase in the United States during "peacetime." In terms of easing credit, since November 1957, the Federal Reserve Board has lowered interest rates four times (from 3.5% to 1.75%), lowered member bank reserve requirements three times (a total of about $1.5 billion, which can expand credit capacity by $8 billion), and lowered stock trading margin requirements (from 70% to 50%), etc. All these measures maintained the United States' massive military-industrial complex; drove the activity of the construction industry; and greatly increased income from agriculture and other items. Specifically expressed as:

(1) Expanding and accelerating military orders. Military orders for this year (including military construction) totaled $22.4 billion, an increase of about $1 billion over the previous year. However, the issuance of military order contracts has increased sharply since last year. In the second half of 1957, military orders were only $7.9 billion, but in the first half of last year, they surged to $13.4 billion, an increase of $5.5 billion; in the second half of last year, they were about $9.4 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion compared with the same period in 1957; and in the first half of this year, they will increase again to about $13 billion.

(2) The construction industry has recovered significantly. The American construction industry employs 15% of the total number of employees and consumes about 20% of steel production, 25% of aluminum, 30% of glass, 75% of wood, and 87% of cement each year. It is one of the important "pillars" of American industrial production. Last year's total construction value was about $49 billion, an increase of $900 million compared with 1957. This is mainly because the government accelerated public construction such as highways and weirs. Last year, government (including state and local) spending in this area totaled $15.3 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion compared with 1957. For example, private residential construction has increased from an annual rate of 920,000 units in February last year to 1.43 million units in December. This is also stimulated by the federal government's increase in residential mortgage subsidies ($1 billion) and relaxed credit conditions; on the other hand, the construction of industrial and commercial plants is continuing to decline.

(3) The increase in agricultural and other incomes stabilized a certain amount of market purchasing power. Due to the 11% increase in agricultural production last year, the government's expenditure on agricultural product price support and other items totaled $5.4 billion, an increase of 70% over the previous year, resulting in an increase of 11% in the total value of agricultural income last year compared with 1957, reaching $38 billion. It is estimated that last year, agricultural production provided nearly $40 billion in consumption markets for American means of production and means of subsistence. At the same time, the government also increased and reissued salaries ($2.7 billion) and increased pensions, unemployment relief expenses, etc. (a total of $4.4 billion).

(2) The method of tightening production adopted by capitalists to maintain monopoly prices has temporarily reduced inventories and is now restoring inventories, thereby playing a role in the partial "adjustment" of production. Taking steel as an example, the output in the first few months of last year was reduced by 40% compared with the same period in 1957, while consumption only decreased by about 20%, and steel inventories decreased from 25 million tons in mid-1957 to 10 million tons in mid-last year. Similarly, automobile inventories also decreased from 865,000 vehicles at the beginning of last year to 370,000 vehicles in October; after that, the restoration of inventories was used to promote the recovery of steel and automobile production. Since the crisis, the inventory of American goods has decreased from a peak of $91.3 billion in August 1957 to $84.9 billion in October, a reduction of $6.4 billion. In addition, the easing of credit and rising prices have also stimulated speculation in the commodity and stock markets. Inflation will ultimately cause widespread damage to the economy, hindering the expansion of reproduction. However, under the threat of inflation, everyone wants to escape currency, that is, to turn currency into commodities and stocks. In this sense, it also has some stimulating effect on industrial production.

II.
The American economic crisis has not passed, and it is insufficient to believe that the United States has entered a stage of depression. The large recovery in industrial production is only due to the influence of some temporary factors, and the United States is far from escaping the basic contradiction of serious overproduction and relative market shrinkage. This is mainly reflected in:

(1) Excessive commodity inventories have increased sharply with the recovery of production. Selling off or directly destroying large quantities of inventories is an important condition for the crisis to transition into a period of depression. This situation does not currently exist. As of October last year, commodity inventories had only decreased by about 7%; since then, inventories have increased from $84.9 billion to $85.9 billion in February of this year; of which durable goods increased the most (from $44.5 billion to $46.7 billion, an increase of as much as $2.2 billion). It is reported that more than 10% of current American steel production is used to accumulate inventories; and automobile inventories have now increased to 850,000 vehicles, which is almost returning to the highest number last year. In agriculture, the government's accumulated surplus products have increased from $7.1 billion in June last year to $9.1 billion in February this year, setting a historical record. This shows that the current recovery in production is basically producing overproduced goods, rather than adapting to market demand.

(2) Production capacity is still abnormally excessive. General underutilization is a common phenomenon in the American economy and is one of the characteristics of the second stage of the general crisis of capitalism. Usually, the utilization rate of American enterprises is maintained above 85%. Even during the two intermediate crises in 1948-1949 and 1953-1954, the utilization rate only dropped to 82% at the lowest; while this crisis started from a drop in the utilization rate to 82% in September 1957, and had dropped to 70% by February last year. American industrial production in 1957 was basically stagnant at the level of 1956, while last year it decreased by 6.5% compared with 1957, that is, regressed to the level of 1953; but since 1956, production capacity has expanded by 11%. Currently, while industrial production is recovering, the enterprise utilization rate is only 75%. Moreover, new investments in many industrial sectors in the previous period will continue to supplement new production capacity. It is estimated that in the next few years, even if corporate investment is greatly reduced, production capacity will still grow by 3% to 4% annually. Such a serious excess of production capacity is not a normal phenomenon and can only indicate that the crisis is far from over.

(3) The unemployment situation has deteriorated again. The number of unemployed people once decreased from 5.43 million in June last year to 3.8 million in October, but increased again to more than 4.1 million in December; in January this year, it surged to 4.724 million; and has continued to increase since February. The number of unemployed people now accounts for 7% of the civilian labor force, while it was 5.8% in January last year. This does not include more than 12 million underemployed people. Among the 149 major industrial areas in the country, there are currently 76 areas with serious unemployment and are called "severely depressed areas." The large number of unemployed people reflects the severity of the crisis. The American government and monopoly capital are already worried that the serious unemployment phenomenon is not only an economic problem, but also a political problem.

The American economic crisis has not only not passed, but in fact the internal factors of the crisis are still actively playing a role, further deepening the crisis. Such as:

(1) Fixed capital investment still remains at a low level of decline. The shrinking of fixed capital renewal is an important factor in promoting the development of this crisis. Last year's fixed capital investment was $30.5 billion, a decrease of 17% compared with 1957 (the previous two intermediate economic crises decreased by 12% and 9.3% respectively); official estimates for this year's fixed capital investment are $31.8 billion, still 14% lower than 1957 ($37 billion); in fact, the annual rate of investment in the first quarter of this year is about $31.2 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with the same period last year ($32.4 billion), and a decrease of 18% compared with the peak in the third quarter of 1957 ($37.5 billion). Even according to the official consistently exaggerated estimates, including the factors of price increases, the increase in this year's investment is negligible. In fact, this year's fixed capital will not only not increase, but may also decrease again. Under the current crisis situation, American monopoly capital will continue to blindly update technical equipment in order to intensify competition; but this has great limitations. Now that production capacity is already greatly excessive, the principle of pursuing maximum profits dominates corporate investment. It is impossible to imagine that American monopoly capital will disregard costs and carry out large-scale equipment updates or develop a large number of new technical sectors at all costs of "intangible attrition." This determines that it is absolutely impossible for the United States to have a new investment boom that drives economic growth in the short term.

(2) The relative shrinkage of the domestic market and the aggravation of the impoverishment of the working people. Since last year, the increase in unemployment and the rise in prices (2.5% higher in 1958 than in 1957) have directly reduced consumer purchasing power. Superficially, the total amount of personal income in the United States last year seems to have increased somewhat, from $347.9 billion in 1957 to $354.4 billion. But the US Department of Commerce also admits that due to inflation, average personal real income is 2% lower than in 1957; and of this, the increase is mainly in dividends, interest, rent, and salaries of government employees, while the income of the working people is constantly declining. For example, the total wages paid by the entire industrial sector last year (a total of $97.3 billion) was reduced by $4.5 billion compared with 1957, a decrease of 5%; according to real wages, it decreased by 7.2%. Due to unemployment and underemployment, about one-third of families across the country have suffered a decline in income. Currently, more than five million people across the country rely on government relief food to fill their stomachs, which is almost double the number from a year ago.

From the perspective of market sales, personal consumption expenditure last year totaled $290.6 billion, an increase of $6.2 billion compared with 1957, an increase of 2.2%. Retail sales, which directly reflect personal consumption expenditure, have increased from $16.1 billion in March last year to $17.6 billion in December, restoring last year's total sales to the level of 1957 ($200 billion), but due to price increases, the actual sales volume has decreased. Two characteristics are prominently reflected in this: (1) Consumers spend a larger proportion of their income on daily necessities, while sales of durable consumer goods (such as cars, refrigerators, and televisions) have decreased significantly (from $68.5 billion in 1957 to $63.4 billion in 1958); (2) The recovery of retail sales is mainly stimulated by installment payments and other credit purchase methods. For example, from October last year to January this year, retail sales increased by $3.7 billion; while consumer debt increased from $43.1 billion to $45.6 billion at the same time, an increase of $2.4 billion. Last year, the scope of American commodity sales on credit has expanded from durable goods to non-durable goods; American newspapers reported that about 200 banks are currently involved in the "gambling" of issuing "consumer credit cards." The American method of pre-paying purchasing power and continuing to inflate consumer credit is actually "robbing Peter to pay Paul," which further aggravates the weakness of the consumer market and poses a risk of credit bankruptcy; as a result, the American government is considering taking measures to restrict it.

III.

The American government's long-term expansion of military preparations and implementation of national economic militarization has made the country's fiscal and financial situation constantly unstable. Further expanding government spending and easing credit under the current crisis of overproduction promotes the serious development of the fiscal and financial crisis. Specifically reflected in:

(1) The fiscal deficit is huge. The federal budget deficit for 1958 was $2.8 billion (the cash budget deficit was $1.5 billion); this year, due to increased government spending and a decrease in tax revenue due to the economic downturn, the deficit increased to $12.9 billion (the cash deficit was $13.2 billion). Including the deficits of state and local governments, this year's fiscal deficit is as high as $15 billion, equivalent to the British government's annual budget expenditure ($5.1 billion pounds). According to estimates by the Congressional Appropriations Committee, even after tightening expenditures as required by Eisenhower, the federal budget deficit for the next year will still be more than $4 billion; at the same time, state and local governments will have a deficit of $2 billion.

(2) The pressure of national debt is getting heavier and heavier. Since last year, the national debt has surged by $11 billion. By the end of January this year, the total amount of national debt had reached a historical peak of $286 billion, and the government pays $8 billion in debt interest each year, accounting for 10% of budget expenditure. This year, $72.5 billion in bonds are due to be exchanged, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to sell bonds. Since last year, most of the bonds (about $9 billion) have been sold to commercial banks, which has actually promoted inflation, because commercial banks can use this to expand credit and accelerate the circulation of bonds in the market. At the same time, due to changes in the structure of American bonds, the bond market is in an extremely unstable state. Compared with the market bonds in 1951, the share of bonds with a term of more than five years has decreased from 34% to 25%, the share of bonds with a term of one to five years has increased from 34% to 35%, and the share of short-term bonds with a term of less than one year has increased from 32% to 40%. Especially since July last year, almost all of the bonds sold have been short-term, which has caused two exchange trends in the market. Among the bonds due this year, short-term bonds (13-week and 26-week treasury bills) account for $26 billion. According to Goebel, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Debt Affairs, if bonds with a term of more than one year cannot be sold within the year, the bonds due next year will increase to $82.5 billion; and so on, in 1963 it will reach $129.5 billion, accounting for 95% of market bonds. The difficulty in selling bonds, the change in the structure of bonds, and the exchange crisis caused by this will not only make the government's fiscal vitality more and more restricted, but will also seriously damage the fiscal and credit system and may lead to its actual collapse.

(3) Deficit spending and credit expansion have promoted inflation. In January this year, the money supply ($239 billion) increased by 6% compared with the same period last year, while it only increased by 2.5% annually before the crisis. Since the crisis, prices have risen by 2.8%; while in the previous two intermediate crises, prices fell by 2% in 1949 and only rose by 0.7% in 1949. Currently, the credit of the dollar is shaking, so that since last year, gold outflows have reached $2.35 billion; it is estimated that it will continue to outflow $1.5 billion this year. The United States currently has gold reserves of $20.44 billion, and the reserve for the amount of currency issued requires $11.9 billion. If $11.6 billion is paid for dollar securities held by foreign countries, there will be a $3 billion "difference." Bourgeois economists believe that if another $2 billion flows out, the US government will be forced to raise the dollar price of gold (from the current $35 per ounce to $50 to $70) to devalue the dollar. Dollar devaluation will definitely cause financial chaos in the capitalist world, especially unfavorable to the United States. This is one of the important reasons why the American officials are clamoring to "stabilize the dollar." In order to escape the impact of inflation, speculation in the stock market is rampant. Last year, the volume of stock trading was second only to 1929-1930. Stock prices rose by 37% in one year, and yields fell to a 12-year low. Although the government can take measures such as raising stock margin requirements to "adjust" the stock market, the danger of a stock price crash is still difficult to control. Even the president of the New York Stock Exchange said that today's stock market is more "worrying" than in 1929, and "no one dares to boldly predict that there will be no collapse."

These phenomena show that the pressure of the current crisis of overproduction on finance is first and foremost reflected in the government's fiscal crisis and inflation. Due to the high development of American state capitalism, national credit has been closely integrated with bank credit. After the crisis began, a credit crisis similar to that in 1929 will not immediately occur. But it is unfounded to believe that there is no fiscal or financial crisis in the United States or that the crisis is not serious. In 1929, American state capitalism was not as highly developed as it is now; when the banking and financial system collapsed, the government could still intervene with credit and financial power and reorganize the banking and financial system; but now the country's "reserve power" has been greatly consumed. If a credit crisis like that in 1929 occurs, it will mean the bankruptcy of the country's entire finance and credit. The severity of the current American fiscal and financial crisis and its potential dangers should not be underestimated.

American government decision-makers have expressed fear about the current fiscal and financial crisis. Eisenhower, Treasury Secretary Anderson, and Federal Reserve Chairman Martin strongly demanded tightening expenditures to "stabilize finance and the dollar." They all exclaimed that the government's financial resources are not "inexhaustible," and even "the money of future generations is about to be spent"; and the collapse of the dollar's credit will lead to "the bankruptcy of the United States and the free world," and it is now at the "critical moment" of fighting inflation. At present, the government has been forced to adopt a tight policy on finance (such as tightening money several times, raising the interest rate of the Federal Reserve Bank from 1.75% to 3.5%; reducing next year's budget expenditure by 3.9 billion, focusing on reducing some "anti-recession" plans in civilian expenditure). However, under the development of the crisis of overproduction, the tightening of finance has certain limitations; and on the contrary, it will play a role in promoting the economic decline. For example, because the government's subsidy for residential mortgage loans this year has been exhausted, the number of residential buildings started has decreased from an annual rate of 1.43 million units in December last year to 1.3 million units in February this year; for example, the government plans to cut agricultural product price support expenses in half, and it is estimated that agricultural income this year will decrease by 5% to 10% compared with last year. These phenomena will become more significant after the new fiscal year begins in the second half of this year.

IV.

At present, the economic crisis of the capitalist world is developing universally; in particular, the crisis conditions in Western European countries have matured and economic crises have begun, which will inevitably deepen the development of the American economic crisis and make it more difficult for the United States to get rid of the crisis.

The entire capitalist world's industrial production decreased by about 3% to 4% last year, and export trade decreased by 6% to 7%. However, the development of crises in various countries is unbalanced. Canada and Japan broke out crises at almost the same time as the United States (and now they have also rebounded temporarily like the United States); last year, the economies of most Western and Northern European countries declined to varying degrees. For example, Belgian industrial production decreased by 7%, Finland decreased by 6.8% (the first nine months), Luxembourg decreased by 4.2%, Norway decreased by 3%, and the United Kingdom decreased by 1%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and other countries also generally decreased; recently, the economies of France (decreasing by about 2% monthly from December last year to February this year) and West Germany (decreasing by 1% in January this year) are beginning to decline. Asian, African, and Latin American raw material producing countries have been in a crisis of serious production decline, a sharp increase in trade deficits, and vicious currency inflation since 1956. Because their trade with the United States accounts for 30%, and their trade with Western European countries accounts for about 60%; the deterioration of the US and Western European economies and the further transfer of the crisis to them will inevitably aggravate the disasters of raw material producing countries.

In recent years, due to the relative growth of the economic strength of Western European countries and the strengthening of competition, the United States has been in an increasingly unfavorable position in the capitalist world market. The proportion of Western European countries in the industrial production of the capitalist world has increased from 29% in 1948 to 36% in 1957, while the United States has decreased from 56% to 50%; and in foreign trade, Western Europe now accounts for 40% of the total export trade of the capitalist world, while the United States only accounts for 20% (it accounted for more than 30% in the early post-war period). On the other hand, the United States still accounts for half of the industrial production and gold reserves of the capitalist world, one-fifth of export trade, and its foreign private investment (totaling about $40.2 billion) is more than the sum of other capitalist countries. It is the largest creditor country and exploiter. Under the impact and threat of economic crises, capitalist countries are all trying to protect themselves, taking measures to protect domestic markets and strengthen competition for foreign markets. They will inevitably conflict with the interests of the United States everywhere, focusing contradictions and pressure on the United States. This is already very obvious at present, such as:

(1) American exports have declined seriously, while imports have basically not declined. Due to the reduction and restriction of imports by other capitalist countries, American commodity exports last year decreased from $19.5 billion in 1957 to $16.3 billion, a decrease of 17%; among them, exports to Western Europe ($4.7 billion) decreased by about 20%, exports to Canada and Japan decreased by 12% and 33% respectively, exports to Latin America decreased by 10%, and exports to other countries also generally decreased. Since January this year, this downward trend has become more serious. Exports in January decreased by 9% compared with the same period last year, and decreased again by 8% in February compared with January. The reason why American imports did not decrease last year is mainly that Western Europe and other capitalist countries have stepped up exports to the United States in order to earn US dollar foreign exchange, and partly because the commodities produced by American overseas enterprises have poor sales and flow back to the United States. Last year, American imports amounted to $12.8 billion, only $200 million lower than in 1957. But among them, imports from Latin America were reduced by 5%, imports from Asia (excluding Japan) were reduced by 12%, while imports from Western Europe increased by 7%, and imports from Japan increased by 12%. Taking the most prominent small cars and steel as examples, the United States imported 430,000 small cars from Western Europe last year, about three times the number of US exports to Western Europe. Western European countries have now seized 8.5% of the American domestic car market, while it only accounted for 5.5% at the beginning of last year; American steel production was reduced by 25%, exports decreased by 50%, but imports increased by 40%.

(2) American foreign investment has declined, and the production of its foreign enterprises is also tending to shrink, which in turn will affect domestic production. The focus of American foreign expansion at present is to expand capital output, attempting to break down the tariff barriers of other countries and dump American goods locally, mainly through capital penetration. Last year, the total amount of American private foreign investment was $3.4 billion, a decrease of $400 million compared with 1957 ($3.8 billion); among them, the funds directly invested in the corporate sector were about $2.7 billion, a decrease of $500 million compared with 1957, a decrease of 12%. As of the end of last year, American private foreign investment totaled $40.2 billion (including government foreign investment, it reached more than $58 billion), of which the investment directly invested in the corporate sector was about $28 billion. About 3,000 large American companies have investments in 91 countries, producing about 30 billion yuan of commodities annually, and about 25% of American imports come from the products of overseas companies. Under the situation that sales in the capitalist world market are becoming increasingly difficult, the production of American overseas enterprises will inevitably be hit, and will affect American domestic production, which has already been manifested in imports.

V.

At present, the American economy continues to be in the process of increasing inventories. Because steel wage contracts will expire in May this year and negotiations will reopen, it is expected that there will be a major strike in July and August. Therefore, the steel industry is accelerating production to hoard inventories, which has a considerable driving effect on other sectors of the American economy; at the same time, the artificial measures of expanding budget expenditures in fiscal year 1959 are still playing a role. Therefore, it is estimated that the American economy may rise for a while in the first half of this year, and there will be no serious decline. However, these temporary factors such as artificial measures cannot solve the contradiction between the massive excess of American production capacity and the relative shrinkage of the market. Under the cover of the temporary recovery in production, the internal factors of the crisis continue to develop, and at the same time there are the increasingly unfavorable effects given by the economic crisis of the capitalist world. American economists and general newspapers estimate that due to the weakening of the above-mentioned artificial measures, the American economy will decline again in the second half of this year, and the decline may even exceed the lowest point in April last year. Even after the decline, the United States may still take measures to expand government spending, ease credit, and partially destroy production; but the serious fiscal and financial crisis has made the government's financial vitality smaller and smaller, and industrial production will decline again after temporarily being stimulated to rise. It seems that the American economic crisis is such an ups and downs, experiencing a more painful chronic rotting process.

    美国经济危机过去了吗？
    苑文
    一
    美国1957年8月开始的周期性经济危机，经过猛烈下降之后，从去年4月起有了很大回升。工业生产指数已从去年4月的126回升到今年2月的144，比1957年危机爆发前的最高峰（1956年12月）只低2点，即回升了下降的90％。但生产回升是不平衡的。制造非耐用品的轻工业部门，由于多年来一直处于停滞状态，今年2月的生产指数已增至138，即超过了危机前的最高点（1957年8月为132）；而以重工业为主的耐用品则增为155，只回升了下跌的70％，比危机前的高峰仍低5.5％；其中重要的部门，如钢产量仍低9％，汽车低10％，机器制造则低17％。
    美国工业生产回升的主要原因是由于政府大力采取了人为措施；同时由于垄断企业紧缩生产，使其超过了市场需求量的下降幅度，即对生产采取了局部破坏的办法。
    （一）政府大量增加开支和放松信贷等措施，起了主要的刺激作用。1959年度（从去年7月开始的一年）联邦政府开支已增加到八百零九亿美元，即较上年度增加了九十亿；其中军费增加了二十亿（包括原子能和军援等共达四百六十一亿），农业、住宅建筑以及公共工程等非军事开支共增七十亿。加上州和地方政府，本年度预算总开支一千二百五十亿，则较1958年度增多一百二十亿。各级政府开支总额在国民生产总值中所占的比重，已从26％增加到28％。这是美国“和平时期”预算增加最大的一年。在放松信贷方面，从1957年11月起，联邦储备局曾四次降低利率（从3.5％降至1.75％），三次降低会员银行储备金（共约十五亿美元，可使信贷能力扩大八十亿），以及降低股票交易保证金（从70％降到50％）等等。所有这些措施维持了美国庞大的军火工业；带动了建筑业的活动；使农业等项收入大为增加。具体表现在：
    （1）扩大和加速了军事订货。本年度军事订货（包括军事建筑）共达二百二十四亿美元，较上年度约增加十亿。但军事定货合同的发放，从去年以来已有急剧地增加。1957年下半年，军事订货还只有七十九亿，去年上半年激增至一百三十四亿，即增加了五十五亿；去年下半年约为九十四亿，亦较1957年同期增加了十五亿；而在今年上半年将再增至一百三十亿左右。
    （2）建筑业显著回升。美国建筑业雇佣了就业总人数的15％，每年约耗钢产量的20％、铝的25％、玻璃的30％、木材的75％、水泥的87％，是美国工业生产的重要“支柱”之一。去年的建筑总值约达四百九十亿，比1957年还增加了九亿。主要是政府加速了诸如公路、水闸之类的公共建筑，去年政府（包括州和地方）在这方面的支出共达一百五十三亿，比1957年增加了十二亿。又如私人住宅建筑已从去年2月年率九十二万幢增加到12月的一百四十三万幢，这也是由于联邦政府增加住宅抵押贷款补助金（十亿美元）以及放宽信贷条件刺激起来的；而另一方面，工商业的厂房建筑却在继续下降。
    （3）农业以及其他收入的增加，稳住了一定的市场购买力。由于去年农业增产11％，政府对农产品价格支持等项的支出共五十四亿，比上年度增加了70％，致使去年农业收入总值比1957年增多11％，达三百八十亿。据估计，去年农业生产为美国生产资料和生活资料提供了将近四百亿美元的消费市场。与此同时，政府还增加和补发薪金（二十七亿美元）以及增加养老金、失业救济费用等（共四十四亿美元）。
    （二）资本家为维持垄断价格所采取的紧缩生产的办法，使存货一时减少，一时又在恢复存货，从而对生产起了局部“调节”的作用。以钢为例，去年头几个月的产量已比1957年同期缩减了40％，而消费量只下降了20％左右，钢的存货量则从1957年年中的二千五百万吨减少到去年年中的一千万吨；同样，汽车存货亦从去年年初的八十六点五万辆下降到10月的三十七万辆；以后则是利用恢复存货来促使钢和汽车产量回升。危机以来，美国商品的存货量，已从1957年8月九百一十三亿的高峰下降到10月的八百四十九亿，即缩减了六十四亿。此外，放松信贷和物价上涨，也刺激了商品和股票市场的投机活动。通货膨胀归根结底会使经济遭到普遍的破坏，它对扩大再生产起着阻碍作用。但在通货膨胀的威胁下，大家都要逃避货币，即把货币变为商品，变为股票，就此而言，它对工业生产也有一些刺激作用。
    二
  美国的经济危机并没有过去，认为美国已经进入萧条阶段是根据不足的。工业生产有很大回升只是一些暂时因素的影响，美国还远未摆脱生产严重过剩和市场相对缩小的基本矛盾。这主要表现在：
    （一）过剩的商品存货随着生产回升急剧增加。大批存货逐渐脱手或者直接加以破坏，是危机转入萧条时期的重要条件。这种情况目前还不存在。到去年10月为止，商品存货量只减少了约7％；此后存货量则又从八百四十九亿增加到今年2月的八百五十九亿；其中又以耐用品增加最多（从四百四十五亿增至四百六十七亿，即增加了二十二亿之多）。据报道，美国钢铁生产现有10％以上是用在堆积存货；而汽车存货现已增至八十五万辆，即将近回到了去年的最高数目。在农业方面，政府积存的过剩产品，已从去年6月的七十一亿美元增加到今年2月的九十一亿，创历史最高纪录。这就说明目前生产回升基本上是在生产过剩商品，而不是适应市场的需求。
    （二）生产能力仍异常过剩。一般开工不足是美国经济中的经常现象，也是资本主义总危机第二阶段的特征之一。通常美国企业的开工率都保持在85％以上，就在1948—1949年和1953—1954年两次中间性危机时期，开工率最低只降到82％；而这次危机是从1957年9月开工率下降到82％开始的，到去年2月已降至70％。美国1957年的工业生产基本上停滞在1956年的水平上，去年则较1957年下降了6.5％，即倒退到1953年的水平；但从1956年以来，生产能力却扩大了11％。目前，在工业生产回升的同时，企业开工率还只有75％。而且，许多工业部门在前一时期的新投资还要不断补充新的生产能力。据估计，在今后数年内，即使企业投资大大削减，生产能力每年仍将增长3％到4％。目前这样严重的生产能力过剩不是通常现象，只能说明危机还远未过去。
    （三）失业情况再度恶化。失业人数一度从去年6月五百四十三万减至10月的三百八十万，12月却又增为四百一十多万；今年1月猛增至四百七十二点四万；2月以后还在继续增加。失业人数现已占到民用劳动力的7％，而去年1月是5.8％。这当中还不包括一千二百万以上的半失业者。全国一百四十九个大工业区，现有七十六个地区存在着严重失业状况而被称为“严重萧条区”。失业的大量存在正是反映了危机的严重程度。美国政府和垄断资本已在担忧，严重失业现象不仅是一个经济问题，而且是一个政治问题。
    美国的经济危机非但没有过去，而且事实上危机的内在因素仍在积极发生作用，使危机进一步在加深。如：
    （一）固定资本投资仍停留在下降的低水平上。固定资本更新的缩小，是促成这次危机发展的重要因素。去年固定资本投资为三百零五亿，较1957年下降17％（前两次中间性经济危机各下降12％、9.3％）；官方估计今年固定资本投资三百一十八亿，仍比1957年（三百七十亿）低14％；实际上今年第一季的投资年率约为三百一十二亿，比去年同期（三百二十四亿）还下降了4％，比1957年第三季的高峰（三百七十五亿）则下降18％。即使按照官方一向夸大的估计，把物价上涨的因素计算在内，则今年投资的增加数字也是微不足道的。实际上今年的固定资本不但不会增加，反而有可能再减少。在目前危机情况下，美国垄断资本为了加剧竞争，将会继续盲目更新技术设备；但这是有很大局限的。现在生产能力已经大量过剩，追求最大利润的原则支配着企业投资，不能设想美国垄断资本将会不顾成本，不惜一切“无形损耗”而进行大规模的设备更新，或是大量发展新的技术部门。这就决定了美国在短时期内绝不可能出现一个新的带动经济上升的投资高潮。
    （二）国内市场相对缩小和劳动人民贫困化的加剧。去年以来，失业增加和物价上涨（1958年较1957年上涨2.5％）就直接降低了消费者的购买力。从表面数字上看，美国去年个人收入总额似乎还有一些增加，即从1957年的三千四百七十九亿美元增加到三千五百四十四亿美元。但美国商务部也承认，由于通货膨胀，平均个人实际收入已比1957年低了2％；而且这当中，增加的主要是股息、利息地租和政府雇佣人员的薪金，而劳动人民的收入却在不断下降。如去年整个产业部门支付的工资（共九百七十三亿美元）已比1957年缩减四十五亿，即下降了5％；按实际工资则下降了7.2％。由于失业和半失业，全国约有三分之一的家庭遭到了收入下降的打击，目前全国依靠领取政府救济粮食充饥的人已超过五百万，比一年前将近增加一倍。
    从市场销售情况来看，去年个人消费支出共计二千九百零六亿美元，比1957年增加六十二亿，即增长了2.2％。直接反映个人消费支出的零售额，虽已从去年3月的一百六十一亿增至12月的一百七十六亿，使去年销售总额恢复到1957年（二千亿）的水平，但因物价上涨，实际销售量还是下降了。这当中还突出地反映出两个特点：（1）消费者把更大部分收入用在日常必需品上，而耐用消费品（汽车、冰箱、电视之类）的消售额则大大下降了（即从1957年六百八十五亿减至1958年六百三十四亿）；（2）零售额的恢复主要是靠分期付款等赊购办法刺激起来的。如从去年10月至今年1月，零售额增加了三十七亿；而消费债务则同时从四百三十一亿增至四百五十六亿，增加了二十四亿。去年美国商品赊销的范围已由耐用品扩大到非耐用品；美国报刊报道，目前约有二百家银行卷入了滥发“消费信贷卡”的“赌博”中。美国采取预支购买力，继续使消费信贷膨胀的办法，实际上是“寅吃卯粮”，使消费市场的虚弱症更形加重，并有引起信用破产的危险；以致美国政府不得不在考虑要采取措施加以限制。
    三
    美国政府长期扩军备战，实行国民经济军事化，已使国家的财政金融经常处于不稳定的状态。而在当前生产过剩危机情况下进一步扩大政府开支和放松信贷，就促进了财政金融危机的严重发展。具体表现在：
    （一）财政赤字庞大。1958年度联邦预算赤字二十八亿（现金预算赤字十五亿）；本年度由于政府增加开支和经济下降使税收减少，赤字增为一百二十九亿（现金赤字一百三十二亿）。加上州和地方政府的赤字，本年度财政赤字则高达一百五十亿，已相当于英国政府一年的预算开支（五十一亿英镑）。据国会筹款委员会估计，下年度即使按照艾森豪威尔所要求的紧缩开支之后，联邦预算赤字仍将有四十多亿；同时，州和地方政府还有二十亿赤字。
    （二）国债的压力愈来愈重。去年以来，国债激增了一百一十亿。到今年1月底，国债总额已创二千八百六十亿的历史高峰，政府每年支付债息即达八十亿，占到预算开支的10％。今年到期需要兑换的公债就有七百二十五亿，推销公债已经日益困难。去年以来，绝大部分公债（约九十亿）是向商业银行推销的，这实际上也就促进了通货膨胀，因为商业银行可以借此扩大信贷并加速公债在市场上的流通。同时由于美国公债结构起了变化，已使公债市场处于极不稳定的状态。与1951年市场公债相比，目前限期五年以上的公债份额已从34％下降到25％，限期一至五年的公债已从34％增至35％，而限期一年以内的短期公债则从32％增至40％。特别是从去年7月以来，推销的公债差不多都是短期的，曾在市场上引起了两次兑换风潮。今年到期公债中，短期公债（为期十三周和二十六周的库券）即占二百六十亿。据财政部国债事务助理高贝尔称，若年内推销不出期限一年以上的公债，则明年到期公债将增至八百二十五亿；依此类推，1963年将达一千二百九十五亿，占市场公债的95％。公债推销困难、公债结构发生了变化以及由此引起的兑换危机，将不仅使得政府的财政活力愈来愈受限制，同时还将严重地破坏财政和信贷体系，并可能导致它的实际崩溃。
    （三）赤字开支和信贷扩张促进了通货膨胀。今年1月货币供应量（二千三百九十亿），已较去年同期增加6％，危机前每年仅增2.5％。自危机以来，物价上涨了2.8％；而在前两次中间性危机中，1949年曾下跌2％，1949年仅上涨0.7％。目前美元信用已在动摇，以致去年以来黄金外流共达二十三点五亿；据估计今年将继续外流十五亿。美国现有黄金储备二百零四点四亿，而货币发行量的准备金需一百一十九亿，若支付外国持有的美元证券一百一十六亿，则有三十亿“差额”。资产阶级经济学家认为，如再外流二十亿，美国政府将被迫提高黄金的美元价格（由目前每盎斯三十五美元提高到五十至七十美元），以使美元贬值。美元贬值肯定会引起资本主义世界金融混乱，尤其对美国不利。这便是美国官方大肆叫嚷要“稳定美元”的重要原因之一。为了逃避通货膨胀的影响，股票市场的投机之风盛行。去年股票交易量之大，仅次于1929—1930年。一年中股票价格上涨了37％，收益率降至十二年来的低点。虽然政府可采取提高股票保证金等措施对股票市场加以“调节”，但股票价格暴跌的危险仍然是难以控制的。连纽约股票交易所所长也说今天的股票市场比1929年更“令人不安”，“谁也不敢大胆预言不会发生崩溃”。
    这些现象说明，目前生产过剩危机加在财政金融上的压力首先突出地反映在政府的财政危机和通货膨胀上。由于美国国家资本主义高度发展，国家信用已和银行信用密切接合，在危机开始后，不会立刻出现类似1929年那样的信用危机。但认为美国目前没有财政金融危机或者危机不严重都是没有根据的。在1929年，美国国家资本主义还没有现在这样高度的发展；在银行和金融体系发生崩溃之际，政府还能用信贷和财政力量加以干预，并改组银行和金融制度；但现在国家的这种“储备力量”已大大地消耗了，如果发生1929年那样的信用危机，那就意味着国家的整个财政和信用的破产。对美国当前财政金融危机的严重性及其潜在着的危险性是不应低估的。
    美国政府决策人物已对当前的财政金融危机表示恐惧，艾森豪威尔、财政部长安德逊和联邦储备局长马丁等强烈要求紧缩开支“稳定财政和美元”。他们都惊呼政府的财力并不是“取之不尽、用之不竭”的，连“子孙的钱都快花光了”；而美元信用的崩溃将会导致“美国和自由世界的破产”，现在已到了同通货膨胀作斗争的“生死关头”。目前，政府已被迫在财政上采取了紧缩的政策（如几次抽紧银根，将联邦储备银行的利率从1.75％提高到3.5％；削减下年度预算开支三十九亿，重点是削减民用开支中的若干“反衰退”计划）。但在生产过剩危机发展的情况下，财政金融上的紧缩是有一定限度的；而反过来却会起到促进经济下降的作用。例如，由于本年度政府对住宅抵押贷款的补助金已经用罄，住宅建筑的动工数已从去年12月的年率一百四十三万幢下降到今年2月的一百三十万幢；又如政府计划将农产品价格支持费用削减一半，估计今年农业收入要比去年下降5％至10％。这些现象在今年下半年新的财政年度开始后将会更加显著。
    四
    目前资本主义世界经济危机正在普遍发展；特别是西欧各国的危机条件已经成熟并已开始了经济危机，这势必加深美国经济危机的发展，使美国更难摆脱危机。
    整个资本主义世界去年工业生产约下降3％至4％，出口贸易下降6％至7％，然而各国危机的发展是不平衡的。加拿大和日本差不多跟美国同时爆发危机（现在亦和美国一样暂时有所回升）；去年多数西、北欧国家的经济都有不同程度的下降，如比利时工业生产下降7％，芬兰下降6.8％（头九个月），卢森堡下降4.2％，挪威下降3％，英国下降1％，而丹麦、荷兰、瑞典、瑞士等国也普遍下降了；最近法国（从去年12月到今年2月逐月约下降2％）、西德（今年1月下降1％）的经济正在开始下降。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲等原料生产国家，从1956年以来一直处在生产严重下降，贸易逆差激增，通货恶性膨胀的危机之中。由于它们和美国的贸易占到30％，和西欧国家的贸易约占60％；美国和西欧经济的恶化，向它们进一步转嫁危机，必然又会加重原料生产国家的灾难。
    近年来，由于西欧国家经济力量的相对增长和竞争力量的加强，美国在资本主义世界市场上已处于日益不利的地位。西欧国家在资本主义世界工业生产中所占的比重，已从1948年的29％增加到1957年的36％，美国则从56％降至50％；而在对外贸易中，目前西欧已占到资本主义世界出口贸易总额的40％，美国只占20％（战后初期占到30％以上）。而在另一方面，美国目前仍占到资本主义世界工业生产和黄金储备的半数、出口贸易的五分之一，其对外私人投资（共约四百零二亿）比其他资本主义国家的总和还要多，是最大的债权国和剥削者，资本主义各国在经济危机的冲击和威胁下，都在图谋自保，采取措施保护国内市场并加强争夺国外市场，它们必然到处都会和美国的利益冲突，把矛盾和压力集中指向美国。这在目前已经表现得很明显，如：
    （一）美国的出口已严重下降，而进口基本上没有下降。由于其他资本主义国家削减和限制进口，去年美国商品出口已从1957年的一百九十五亿减至一百六十三亿，即下降了17％；其中，对西欧出口（四十七亿）约下降20％，对加拿大和日本各降12％和33％，对拉丁美洲下降10％，对其余国家也普遍下降了。今年1月以来，这种下降趋势更严重了，1月出口已比去年同期下降9％，2月份又比1月份再下降8％。美国去年进口没有减少，主要是西欧及其他资本主义国家为了争取美元外汇，而加紧对美输出，部分是由于美国海外企业生产的商品销路不佳又倒流至美国。去年，美进口额一百二十八亿美元，比1957年只低二亿。但其中从拉丁美洲进口缩减了5％，从亚洲地区（不包括日本）减少了12％，而来自西欧的进口却增加了7％，从日本进口增加了12％。以最突出的小汽车和钢铁为例，去年美国从西欧进口了四十三万辆小汽车，约为美国输往西欧的三倍，西欧国家现已夺取了美国国内汽车市场的8.5％，而去年年初只占5.5％；美国钢铁产量缩减了25％，出口下降50％，但进口却增加了40％。
    （二）美国对外投资下降，其国外企业生产亦趋向萎缩，反过来又会影响国内生产。美国目前对外扩张的重点是扩大资本输出，企图主要以资本渗入的方式来打破其他国家的关税壁垒，就地倾销美货。去年，美私人对外投资总额三十四亿，较1957年（三十八亿）下降了四亿；其中直接投入企业部门的资金约为二十七亿，比1957年缩减了五亿，即下降12％。截至去年底，美国对外私人投资共达四百零二亿（包括政府对外投资则达五百八十多亿），其中直接投入企业部门的投资约为二百八十亿。美国约有三千多家大公司在九十一个国家有投资，每年生产的商品约在三百亿以上，而在美国进口额中约有25％是来自海外公司的产品。在资本主义世界市场销售日益困难的情况下，美国海外企业的生产必然亦会受到打击，并影响美国国内生产，这在进口方面已经表现出来。
    五
    目前美国经济仍继续处于增加存货的过程。由于今年5月间钢铁工资合同期满要重开谈判，预计7、8月会发生大罢工，因此，钢铁业正在加速增产以囤积存货，这对美国经济其他部门有相当的带动作用；同时1959年度扩大预算的开支的人为措施也还在起作用，因此，估计美国经济在今年上半年还可能上升一个时候，不会发生严重的下降。但这些人为措施等暂时性因素是不可能解决美国生产能力大量过剩和市场相对缩小的矛盾的，在生产暂时回升的掩盖下，危机的内在因素仍在继续发展，同时还有资本主义世界经济危机所给与的日益不利的影响。美国经济学家和一般报刊都估计，由于上述人为措施的减弱，美国经济在今年下半年将会重新下降，其下降幅度甚至可能会超过去年4月的最低点。纵然在下降之后，美国还可能采取扩大政府开支、放松信贷以及局部破坏生产的办法；但严重的财政金融危机已经使得政府的财政活力愈来愈小，工业生产在暂时受到刺激上升之后又会下降。看来美国经济危机就是这样一起一伏，经历着更加痛苦的慢性腐烂过程。
