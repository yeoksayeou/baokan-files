    Commune Cadres Must Participate in Production
    Speech by Committee Member Wang Yukun

    Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I fully agree with Premier Zhou's report and the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li. Our cooperative developed to 325 households in 1956, and all the farmers in the village joined the advanced cooperative. After the wheat harvest in 1958, we established the People's Commune, which had 45 villages, 12,038 households, 48,671 people, and more than 139,800 mu of land. Our Nanwangzhuang, with its 325 households, is a production brigade under the Hongxing Commune in Shen County, Hebei Province.

    Now I would like to talk about my experiences in participating in field production and using production to drive production. Cadre participation in production can allow them to understand the situation and discover problems in a timely manner, and can also strengthen ties with the masses. In 1956, we planted peanuts too early, and the seedlings did not emerge well, which dissatisfied the cooperative members, so the cadres made a self-criticism. In 1957, we accepted the advice of the old farmers and waited until after the Beginning of Summer when the soil felt warm to the touch before planting. As a result, the seedlings emerged completely and the harvest was very good. When planting cotton, based on our local climate, it is suitable to plant early. The cooperative members said, "If you plant early, the cotton bolls will form early, and if the rainy season comes, they will sit on a few hard bolls: they won't fall off." We accepted the opinions of the masses and appropriately advanced the sowing date. In 1958, cotton bollworms infested the cotton. The cooperative members reported, "These worms hide inside the cotton bolls and only come out around dusk, so you can't catch them all." When we discovered that the masses lacked confidence in controlling cotton bollworms, we discussed with the production team leaders using "1605" to spray the cotton. The damage lessened after one spraying, and the pest was completely eliminated after the second spraying. Later, we found that the cooperative members also lacked confidence in controlling corn borers. The county party secretary planted one mu of experimental cornfield in our team. After we personally used 666 to irrigate the corn hearts and removed the tassels and the worms on the red line of the corn flowers, the pests were completely eliminated. Through these two practical pest control educations, we solved the ideological problem of the masses' lack of confidence in pest control.

    Usually, when we solicit the opinions of the cooperative members, they are sometimes unwilling to offer them, but if you work with them in the fields, they will tell you everything. I found during production that the third production team leader did little work, and the cooperative members had complaints. The cooperative members said, "The team leader only tells others to work, but he doesn't go himself." So I went to the third production team to help plant trees. When the team leader saw me working every day, he was embarrassed not to work. I also educated him. After I left, the third team leader also worked more, and the cooperative members were very satisfied, saying, "Our team leader is much better than before." If a cooperative member has shortcomings, if you talk to him individually while working, he is very happy because he says you care about him. But if you name him and criticize him in a meeting, he will be unhappy.

    After I and the commune party committee secretary took the lead in participating in production, more other cadres participated in production, and the cooperative members worked harder than before. Last winter, I and the party committee secretary took the lead in carrying manure baskets to collect manure. Our brigade secretary was a student and had not done much farm work. When he saw that the main cadres of our brigade were carrying manure baskets, he automatically carried a manure basket himself when he worked in his own village or other villages. An old man, Wang Laoxun, and two other old men were assigned by the cooperative to sweep the streets. He saw me carrying a basket to collect manure every day and said to me, "Why are you so active?" He meant that since we are not buying houses and land for ourselves now, why are you still working so actively? I said to him, "My activeness is not for myself. Carrying a manure basket is to accumulate fertilizer for the production team. If everyone in our team carries a manure basket, there will be more fertilizer in the fields, and how much more grain can be produced." After hearing these words, the old man understood and he also carried a manure basket to sweep the streets and collect manure. The production team leaders reflected, "When your brigade cadres go to work in a team, the cooperative members in that team work hard." I asked him why this was so. He said, "The cooperative members feel that the cadres hold meetings at night and work the same as us during the day, and they do the heavy work in the fields. How can we not work hard?" With the cadres taking the lead in participating in production and the cooperative members having high production enthusiasm, our brigade did a very good job in production in 1958. The average grain yield per mu reached 1,001 jin (including potatoes converted to grain), an increase of more than three times compared to the yield of 231 jin per mu in 1957. The brigade and production team collectively raised more than 800 pigs and more than 200 sheep, and the cooperative members raised more than 400 pigs and more than 200 sheep. We also planted a large number of fruit trees and economic forests. Chairman Mao called for extracting oil from trees and planting walnuts, so we planted 50 mu of walnut seedlings. We also planted more than 200 mu of wild pear trees and more than 200 mu of willow poles, 4,000 peach trees, 20 mu of mulberry trees, and more than 10,000 other trees. The achievement of the above results is inseparable from the participation of the leading cadres of the commune in production, which shows the importance of cadre participation in labor.

### 公社干部一定要参加生产  王玉坤委员的发言

    公社干部一定要参加生产
    王玉坤委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意周总理的报告和两位李副总理的报告。我们社一九五六年发展到三百二十五户，全村所有的农户都加入了高级社。到了一九五八年麦收以后成立了人民公社，全社有四十五村一万二千零三十八户，四万八千六百七十一人，有土地一十三万九千八百多亩。我们南王庄的三百二十五户是河北省深县红星公社下面的一个生产大队。
    我现在谈一谈参加田间生产，以生产带动生产的一点体会。干部参加生产能够及时了解情况、发现问题，又能够加强和群众的联系。一九五六年我们的花生种早了，苗儿出得不好，社员们不满意，干部作了检讨。到一九五七年我们接受了老农的建议，立夏以后摸着土已经热呼呼的了才下种，结果苗儿出的全，收成很好。种棉花根据我们那儿的气候适合早种，社员们说，“种的早，坐桃儿也早，赶雨季来了坐上几个硬桃儿：不落铃”。我们接受了群众的意见适当的提前早播。一九五八年棉花生棉铃虫，社员们反映说：“这虫儿藏在棉铃里面，傍黑才出来，捉也捉不应。”我们发现了群众对治棉铃虫的信心不高时，就和生产队长们商量用“一六○五”喷棉花，喷了一次就见轻，第二次虫害就彻底消灭了。后来又发现治玉米钻心虫时社员的信心也不高。县委书记在我们队种了一亩玉米试验田，经过我们亲自下手用六六六灌玉米心，又去了雄穗和玉米花红线上的虫子，结果治干净了。通过这两次治虫的实际教育解决了群众对治虫信心不高的思想问题。
    平常我们征求社员们的意见，有时候他们就不肯提，可是你和他一块到地里干活儿，他什么话也爱跟你讲。我在生产中发现第三生产队的队长干活少，社员们有意见。社员们说：“队长光支使别人干活，他自己却不去”。我就到第三生产队去帮助栽树，队长见我天天干活，他也不好意思不干。我又对他进行了教育。我走后三队队长干活也多了，社员们很满意地说：“我们的队长比过去好多了”。社员要是有缺点，你在干活中和他个别一谈，他很高兴说你关心他，如果你要是在大会上点他的名批评他，他就不高兴。
    我和公社党委书记带头参加生产以后，其他干部参加生产的人多了，社员们干活也比从前卖力气了。去年冬天我和党委书记带头背粪筐拾粪。我们大队的秘书是学生出身的，没多干过地里活，看见我们大队主要干部都背粪筐，他自己在本村或者到外村工作时也自动地背起了粪筐。有个老汉王老逊，社里分派他们三个老汉扫街。他看见我天天背筐捡粪就对我说：“你这么积极干什么？”意思是说现在又不为个人买房置地了，你还这么积极干活干啥。我对他说：“我积极不是为了个人，背粪筐是为了给生产队积肥，要是咱们队的人都背起粪筐，地里粪多了，该能多打多少粮食。”听了这些话以后，老汉思想通了，他自己也背上粪筐连扫街带拾粪。生产小队的队长们反映：“你们大队干部到那个队干活那个队社员就楞干”。我问他为什么这样？他说：“社员们觉着，干部们黑夜开会，白天和咱们一样干活，到地里什么活重干什么，咱们还能不好好干。”干部们带头参加生产，社员们生产情绪高，一九五八年我们大队生产搞的很好。粮食产量每亩平均达到一千零一斤（包括薯类折粮），比一九五七年的亩产二百三十一斤增加了三倍多。大队和生产队集体养猪八百多头，羊二百多只，社员户养猪四百多头，羊二百多只。我们还种植了大量的果木树和经济林。毛主席提出向树要油种核桃的号召，我们就种了五十亩核桃苗。还种了二百多亩杜梨树和二百多亩柳杆子，四千棵桃树，二十亩桑树，还有其它树木一万多棵。以上成绩的取得是和公社的领导干部参加生产分不开的，这说明干部参加劳动的重要。
