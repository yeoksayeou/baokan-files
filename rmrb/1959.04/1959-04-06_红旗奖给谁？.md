    Who Gets the Red Flag Award?
      The village bustles with spring plowing,
      Grasping the Eight-Character Charter tightly.
      To win the first battle of rice transplanting,
      The production fervor burns bright and red.
    After these four lines of verse, I'll tell the story of "Two Mulan."
    Recently, the Nanjiang Commune Party Committee in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, issued a battle cry to complete rice transplanting by "Grain Rain" (a solar term). As soon as this call was made, the commune members were eager to try, unanimously expressing: Resolutely win the first battle for increased grain production—rice transplanting! Look! Red flags are fluttering, warhorses are galloping; listen! Bugles are sounding, and the sound of hoes shakes the earth. The competition arenas are set up more and more; the heroes and heroines are competing more and more enthusiastically. Sixty-year-old grandmothers call for martial arts competitions, and seventy-year-old grandfathers show their heroism. Finding opponents, setting conditions, submitting battle declarations, "duet shows" (competitive performances) are being staged everywhere.
    One day, the rising sun casted its rays, and the morning mist was thick. The women of the Third Production Team of Shangtashi Brigade received a challenge letter from the women's shock brigade of the Second Team. The challenge letter read: "For a greater leap forward, compare fertilizer accumulation and delivery in four ways: drive, perseverance, determination, and an average of 50 dan of fertilizer accumulation and delivery per person per day." After reading the challenge letter, the women of the Third Team sat around the edge of the field, discussed it, and immediately wrote a reply: "The women of the Third Team have a good reputation. We read the challenge letter yesterday. Today, we come to the arena to compete. We will not retreat until we win the red flag."
    The two teams faced off, each encouraging their own efforts. Xiao Mu Ji, the leader of the women's shock brigade of the Second Team, saw that transporting fertilizer to the fields was tiring and inefficient, so she immediately convened a "Zhuge Liang meeting" (brainstorming session) and used active wheels to modify amphibious vehicles, each carrying more than 600 jin of fertilizer. After this reform of transportation tools, the team's average fertilizer delivery per person per day reached 100 dan, doubling work efficiency, and receiving material rewards from the brigade. The women of the Third Team refused to be outdone. After a discussion, they borrowed four flatbed carts and five handcarts from factories and schools, so the average work efficiency also reached more than 100 dan. This worried the brigade cadres: Who should get the title of "Mulan" team? Who should get the red flag? After some debate, they finally decided: Both teams will get the red flag, and both teams will be called "Mulan" teams.

### 红旗奖给谁？

    红旗奖给谁？
      人喧马闹忙春耕，
      抓住八字宪法不放松。
      为了打响插秧头一炮，
      生产热潮比火红。
    四句小诗道罢，引出一段“两个穆桂英”的故事来。
    最近，湖南平江县南江公社党委提出了“谷雨”完成插秧的战斗号召。这个号召一发出，社员们个个磨拳擦掌，一致表示：坚决打响粮食增产的头一炮——插秧。看！红旗招展，战马飞奔；听！号角连天，锄声震地。那竞赛擂台，越摆越多；众英雄好汉，愈赛愈热。六十岁的婆婆喊比武，七十岁的公公逞英豪。找对手，定条件，下战表，到处唱起了“对台戏”。
    一天，旭日东升，晨雾浓浓。上塔市大队三生产队的妇女，接到了二队妇女突击队送来的战书。战书写着：“为了更大跃进，积肥送肥比四条：干劲、钻劲、决心、平均每人每日积肥送肥五十担。”三队妇女看罢战书，围着田坎，坐下讨论，马上写了应战书：“三队妇女素有名，昨日战书看得清，今日上台来打擂，不夺红旗不收兵。”
    两队交锋，各鼓干劲。二队妇女突击队长萧慕基，看到运肥下田，人疲劳，工效低，随即召开一个“诸葛亮会”，用活动车轮，改装了水陆两用车，一车一转运肥六百多斤。这样改革了运输工具以后，全队每人每天平均运肥达到一百担，工效提高一倍，受到大队的物质奖励。三队妇女不甘示弱，经大伙儿一商量，从工厂、学校借到四部板车和五部土车，这样平均工效也达到百担以上。这一来，可愁坏了大队干部：“穆桂英”队的称号该谁得？红旗又该谁拿？经过一番争论，最后作出决定：两队都得红旗，两队都叫“穆桂英”队。
