Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou’s Government Work Report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I would like to offer some opinions on boosting steel production by improving the mass movement in iron and steel enterprises:

Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the strong support of fraternal units across the country, the workers of our Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company have engaged in a great technical revolution and a vigorous mass movement, launching a red banner competition for high output, high quality, and high efficiency, and overfulfilling the first quarter’s production targets for pig iron, steel, and steel products. The three major new construction projects—blast furnace, coke oven, and sintering plant—are now in the final stages of installation and will soon be put into production. After detailed discussions by the masses, all employees have unanimously pledged to fulfill the glorious tasks assigned to our company by the state for the year’s production and capital construction plans, and are determined to overfulfill them.

The reasons why we completed the first quarter’s plan relatively well and are confident of overfulfilling the annual targets are, like the rest of the country, mainly due to the fact that all employees, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, have exerted full effort, opposed conservatism, and engaged in a great technical revolution and a vigorous mass movement. This year, in the first quarter, we summarized the experience of the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and adopted a method of grasping early, grasping tightly, and grasping thoroughly for measures to overfulfill the annual plan, successively launching several upsurges of mass movements. Our methods and main experiences are:

First, rely on the masses, exert full effort, continuously oppose conservative thinking, and conscientiously implement the policy of continuing the Great Leap Forward. At the beginning of the year, after completing the tasks of 1958, some cadres showed signs of taking a breather. Furthermore, they lacked confidence in the Great Leap Forward of 1959, believing that the production potential of the existing equipment had been almost completely tapped during last year’s Great Leap Forward. The company’s Party committee analyzed this situation and decided to first establish the idea of an all-round leap forward among all employees, organizing the study of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, greatly enhancing the understanding of cadres and workers at all levels regarding the current situation and tasks. The employees were full of energy and high morale, putting forward the fighting slogan of “The east wind inspires heroic courage, bravely break through the leap forward barrier, ensure one million tons of steel, and strive to double all targets.” Many cadres recognized that the Great Leap Forward is the basic step for building socialism and examined their thinking of "taking a breather". While affirming the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we also emphasized to the masses that some of our main technical and economic indicators were still lagging behind the most advanced levels in the country. This further stimulated the enthusiasm of the employees and launched a new upsurge of socialist competition to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced.

After studying the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and analyzing the conditions for our production this year, we formulated a preliminary plan for the year’s leap forward, with leading cadres directly informing the masses about the situation, tasks, difficulties, and solutions. Once many difficulties were handed over to the masses, a mass movement to find solutions and devise measures was immediately launched. For example, when the iron ore content decreased, before the new ore dressing plant was built, more than 300 people were mobilized to use indigenous methods to wash the ore to increase the iron content; when the slag accumulation on the converter's smoke hood became excessive, affecting operations, workers were organized to clear it day and night while continuing production, and actively sought ways to改造 the smoke hood equipment; when coke was in short supply, before the new coke oven was put into production, cadres and workers worked together to produce more than 10,000 tons of native coke. In short, as long as the masses are fully mobilized and rely on the wisdom of the broad masses of employees, many difficulties can be overcome. Difficulties cannot scare the masses; the masses become stronger in the face of difficulties.

Second, mobilize the masses to engage in a great technical revolution. After the employees' enthusiasm rose, the company’s Party committee conducted further research and believed that to ensure the overfulfillment of the leap forward plan, it was also necessary to work hard, work practically, and work skillfully, learn from the advanced experience of fraternal factories, and further mobilize the masses to solve the weak links in production. Each factory and mine focused on the key issues in production and organized employees to engage in a great technical revolution. During the discussion of the plan alone, employees voiced 50,000 opinions and put forward more than 2,000 suggestions. The steelmaking plant proposed twelve major technical measures, the main ones being ore dressing, increasing hot blast temperature, increasing air volume, and external desulfurization with white lime, etc. Through the implementation of these measures, the smelting intensity will be further increased, the coke ratio will be reduced, and efforts will be made to catch up with the most advanced utilization coefficient in the country. After the smelting intensity of the blast furnace increased, the output of pig iron increased, and new imbalances appeared in production. The air volume of the blast furnace was insufficient, and the employees of the power plant proposed measures to improve the steam pipelines to supplement the steam needed by the blower. Workers on the three shifts immediately experimented with and改造 the equipment themselves, and as a result, the air volume of blower No. 3 was increased by 50 cubic meters per minute. Intra-plant transportation became even more strained due to the increased production of pig iron. To ensure production, the employees of the transportation department proposed 365 measures. After implementation, the loading and unloading efficiency increased by 26 percent, basically adapting to the needs of production growth. The employees of the coking plant, in order to increase coke production and fully guarantee the needs of the blast furnace, proposed improving fire-regulation operations and shortening carbonization time, which could increase coke production by more than 10,000 tons throughout the year.

Third, specify the measures and combine mass movements with strengthening enterprise management. Can the leap forward plan be realized? The key question is whether there are specific measures and whether the measures are implemented. To ensure the implementation of the measures, we also adopted the method of conducting vigorous mass movements and carrying out meticulous organizational work. From the company to the group level, “five determinations” are implemented at each level, namely, determine the project, determine the method, determine the progress, determine the person in charge, and periodically check the results. Through the "five determinations," plans for completing the measures were established at each level from the company to the group.

In the month of March alone, 824 of the company's 1,590 measures were implemented, including 130 larger projects. After these measures were implemented, the company’s production outlook rapidly changed. In the first ten days of April, the average daily output of pig iron in the company increased by 10 percent compared with the average in March.

Fourth, launch a red banner competition movement for high output, high quality, and high efficiency. To engage in vigorous mass movements, it is necessary to strengthen the centralized leadership of the Party, continuously improve leadership methods, and fully unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of everyone. In this regard, we used various functional organizations to focus prominently on competition and appraisal work. At present, the company’s affiliated factories have launched competitions based on industry and with fraternal factories, and within the company, there are also comprehensive competitions between factories, between furnaces, between shifts, between groups, and between individuals. This kind of competition between the same industry and the same type of work has a clear opposite, making it easy to discover typical examples, exchange experiences, and drive the general. Moreover, the production organization and technical conditions are roughly the same, and the appraisal is relatively easy, which also facilitates the exchange of experience. For example, in the competition, the steelmaking plant established a system of regular exchange of technical experience and mutual exchange of information with fraternal factories such as Benxi and Taiyuan, which has greatly helped improve the technical level of employees.

Fellow delegates: After hearing Premier Zhou’s report, the enthusiasm of all our company’s employees is even greater. Although there are still many difficulties and shortcomings in our work, everyone is unanimously confident in overcoming these difficulties, improving these shortcomings, and guaranteeing the completion and guaranteeing the overfulfillment of our glorious steel tasks.

    充分发动群众　组织生产高潮
    安朝俊代表谈石景山钢铁公司大抓措施的体会主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。我现在就在钢铁企业中搞好群众运动以增产钢铁来发表一点意见：
    今年以来，我们石景山钢铁公司的职工，在冶金工业部和中共北京市委的领导下，在全国兄弟单位的大力支援下，大闹技术革命、大搞群众运动，开展了高产、高质、高效率的红旗竞赛，超额完成了第一季度生铁、钢、钢材的生产任务。新建的高炉、焦炉、烧结厂三项主要工程，现在安装工程到了最后阶段，很快就要投入生产了。全年生产和基本建设的计划指标，经过群众详细讨论，全体职工一致保证完成国家交给我们公司的光荣任务，并有决心超额完成。
    我们第一季计划完成得较好，并有信心超额完成全年任务的原因和全国一样，主要是全体职工在总路线的光辉照耀下，鼓足干劲、反对保守、大闹技术革命、大搞群众运动的结果。今年第一季度我们总结了一九五八年大跃进的经验，对超额完成全年计划的措施，采取抓早、抓紧、抓透的办法，先后掀起了几个群众运动的高潮。我们的作法和主要体会是：
    第一、依靠群众，鼓足干劲，不断地反对保守思想，认真贯彻继续大跃进的方针。年初，完成一九五八年任务以后，在部分干部当中曾出现了松一口气的现象。并且对一九五九年的大跃进心信不足，他们认为旧有设备的生产潜力在去年大跃进中差不多挖尽了。公司党委分析了这种情况，决定首先在全体职工中树立全面跃进的思想，组织了关于党中央八届六中全会决议的学习，大大提高了各级干部和工人对当前形势和任务的认识。职工们干劲十足，斗志昂扬，他们提出了“东风鼓起英雄胆，奋勇突破跃进关，确保钢铁一百万，力争指标都翻番”的战斗口号。很多干部认清了大跃进是设建社会主义的基本步伐，检查了“松一口气”的思想。我们在肯定一九五八年大跃进成就的同时，又着重向群众指出我们的若干主要技术经济指标比国内最先进水平有些还是落后的，这样就更加激发了职工的情绪，掀起了比先进、学先进、赶先进的社会主义竞赛的新高潮。
    经过党中央八届六中全会决议的学习，分析了我们今年生产中各方面的条件，制订了全年跃进的初步规划，领导干部直接向群众交形势、交任务、交困难、交办法。很多困难一旦交给群众之后，立即掀起了一个群众性的找窍门、搞措施的运动，如矿石含铁量降低了，在新的选矿厂没有建立起来以前，就动员三百多人，用土法水洗矿石以提高矿石含铁量；转炉的烟罩积渣过多，响影操作了，就一面坚持生产，一面组织工人日夜轮番清打，并且积极设法改造烟罩设备；焦炭不足了，在新焦炉没有投入生产以前，干部和工人一齐动手，炼出了一万多吨土焦炭。总之，只要充分发动群众，依靠广大职工的智慧，很多困难都是可以克服的。困难是吓不倒群众的，群众在困难面前越战越强。
    第二、发动群众，大闹技术革命。群众的干劲起来以后，公司党委又作了研究，认为确保跃进计划的超额完成，还必须苦干、实干加巧干，学习兄弟厂的先进经验，进一步发动群众解决生产中的薄弱环节。各厂矿纷纷围绕生产中的关键提出课题，组织职工大闹技术革命。仅在讨论计划中职工就鸣放了五万条意见，提出了二千多条建议。炼铁厂提出了十二项重大技术措施，主要的有进行选矿、提高风温、加大风量、炉外白灰脱硫等等，通过这些措施的实现，将进一步提高冶炼强度，降低焦比，争取把利用系数赶上国内最先进的水平。高炉的冶炼强度提高以后，生铁产量增加了，生产上出现了新的不平衡。高炉的风量不足，动力厂的职工又提出了改进蒸汽管道的措施，补充风机所需要的蒸汽。三班运行工人立刻自己动手试验改装，结果把三号风机的风量每分钟提高了五十立方公尺。厂内运输由于生铁增产更加紧张，运输部的职工为了保证生产，提出了三百六十五项措施，实现以后，装卸效率提高了百分之二十六，基本适应了生产增长的需要。焦化厂的职工为增产焦炭，充分保证高炉需要，提出改进调火操作，缩短炭化时间的建议，全年可以增产焦炭一万多吨。
    第三、把措施具体化，使群众运动和加强企业管理工作结合起来。跃进计划能否实现？关键问题在于有没有具体措施和措施是否落实。为了使措施落实，我们也采取大搞群众运动的方法，进行细致的组织工作。从公司到小组层层实行“五定”，即定项目、定办法、定进度、定负责人、定期检查效果。通过“五定”从公司到小组逐级都有了完成措施的计划。
    在三月份一个月内全公司一千五百九十项措施，就实现了八百二十四项，其中有较大的项目一百三十项。这些措施实现以后，公司生产面貌迅速有所改变。全公司四月上旬生铁的平均日产量比三月份平均增长百分之十。
    第四、展开高产、高质、高效率的红旗竞赛运动。大搞群众运动，必须加强党的集中领导，不断地改善领导方法，把每个人的积极性和创造性充分发挥出来。在这方面，我们运用了各职能组织突出地抓住竞赛和评比工作。目前，公司所属各厂已按产业和各兄弟厂展开了竞赛，在公司内部也展开了厂与厂、炉与炉、班与班、组与组、人与人的全面竞赛。这种同产业、同工种之间的竞赛，对立面明确，便于发现典型，交流经验，带动一般。而且生产组织和技术条件大体相同，评比起来，比较容易，也便于交流经验。如炼铁厂在竞赛中和本溪、太原等兄弟厂建立了定期的交流技术经验、互通情况的制度，对提高职工的技术水平有很大作用。
    各位代表：我们全公司的职工，听到了周总理的报告以后，大家的干劲更足了，我们工作中虽然还有不少的困难和缺点，但大家一致有信心克服这些困难，改进这些缺点，保证完成和保证超额完成我们光荣的钢铁任务。
