Comrades and Representatives,

I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Premier Zhou Enlai's report comprehensively summarized the brilliant achievements and experiences of the great leap forward in our country's socialist construction during the First National People's Congress, especially in 1958, and also pointed out the tasks on the political, economic, cultural, and educational fronts in 1959. This report will greatly encourage the people of the whole country to work harder and promote a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction. Premier Zhou mentioned the issue of our country's political life and used specific examples to point out the consolidation of our people's democratic dictatorship and the close unity of all ethnic groups. He also mentioned the Tibet issue, which is very correct, and I completely agree.

Imperialism has always bought over and utilized the dregs of various nationalities in an attempt to undermine the unity of the motherland and disrupt national unity, but they have all failed. Imperialists and foreign reactionaries will not gain anything on the Tibet issue.

"The unity of the motherland is the supreme interest of all nationalities in the country." Any imperialists and reactionaries who attempt to undermine the unity of our motherland will inevitably be resolutely countered by the people of all ethnic groups in our motherland. The former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, with the support of imperialists and foreign reactionaries, launched a counter-revolutionary rebellion to undermine the unity of the motherland and national unity, kidnapped the Dalai Lama and fled to India, and recently, in the name of the Dalai Lama, issued a so-called statement that distorts the truth. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang express infinite indignation at this. (Warm applause)

The despicable trick consistently used by imperialism to invade our country is to buy over and utilize the dregs of various nationalities in an attempt to create so-called "independence" in order to achieve their goal of undermining the unity of the motherland and national unity. Such instances have occurred among many ethnic groups in our country in the past, but these attempts have all been unsuccessful.

In Xinjiang, imperialism once bought over and utilized Yaqub Beg and others during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty to create rebellions against the motherland. Before liberation, they bought over and utilized Masud and Emin Ehsa, these kinds of national scum, to act as their running dogs. These people also put forward the slogan of so-called national independence in order to cover up their ugly face of selling out the interests of the motherland and the nation. History has made the fairest judgment on these shameful scum. (Applause) As everyone knows, people like Emin Ehsa had to flee abroad in the end and run to their masters, becoming pathetic creatures living under the thumb of others. Can the Tibetan rebels have any other way out? (Warm applause)

Since the conspiracy of imperialism to undermine our country's unity and national unity could not be realized in the past, it is fundamentally impossible for them to achieve their goals today, when the people of our country are united even more closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In fact, the rebellion in Tibet has been basically quelled. We believe that with the help and support of all nationalities in the motherland, the Tibetan people will soon build Tibet into a democratic socialist new Tibet. (Applause)

Imperialists and foreign reactionaries will not gain anything on the Tibet issue. We hope that the Dalai Lama can get rid of his controlled situation and return to the motherland. (Warm applause)

Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Victoriously Overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan, Changing the Poor and Backward Face Before Liberation

Our country's minority nationalities must unite in the big family of the motherland, must rely on the leadership of the Party, and implement the Party's ethnic policies in order to get rid of poverty and backwardness and achieve rapid development of politics, economy, and culture. This has been proven by the construction experience of various minority areas in our country in recent years. The facts of political, economic, and cultural development in various minority areas cannot be denied by any imperialists and reactionaries. The construction achievements of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region also fully prove this. (Applause)

Under the leadership and help of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has achieved unprecedented and great achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction during the First National People's Congress. During this period, democratic reforms and socialist transformations were carried out, promoting the development of industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production. By the end of 1957, the first five-year plan for developing the national economy was victoriously completed and overfulfilled. Compared with 1952, the total value of industrial and agricultural output increased by 84.72 percent, grain output increased by 26.63 percent, livestock increased by 46.43 percent, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings also made great progress. With the development of economic, cultural, and health undertakings, the people's living standards have been significantly improved, and the people's purchasing power has increased 1.2 times compared with 1952. This has greatly changed the poor and backward face of Xinjiang before liberation. (Warm applause)

1958 was also a year of great leap forward in socialist construction in Xinjiang. In this year, under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang were full of energy, promoting the great development of various construction undertakings. The total value of industrial and agricultural output increased by 45.51 percent compared with 1957. In terms of agricultural production, the irrigated area was expanded by 6.61 million mu, 5.62 million mu of wasteland was reclaimed, and the total grain output reached 6.4 billion jin, an increase of 57.3 percent compared with 1957, with an average of 1,093 jin of grain per person. The total cotton output reached 1.47 million dan, an increase of 51 percent compared with 1957; the total oilseed output reached 185 million jin, an increase of 27.4 percent compared with 1957. Animal husbandry production also achieved rapid development. In terms of industry, in the upsurge of the whole people running industry with steel as the key link, more than one million cadres and masses fought on the iron and steel front. In a few months, they won a great victory of more than 182,000 tons of iron and more than 35,000 tons of steel. Cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also made great progress. The entire autonomous region has five universities, 206 secondary schools, more than 1,000 agricultural schools, and 4,534 primary schools, with more than 800,000 students in school, and primary education has been basically universalized. Under the influence of the national people's commune movement and on the basis of the great leap forward in socialist construction in the autonomous region, people's communes were universally realized in rural areas last autumn. More than 70 percent of the herdsmen in pastoral areas have also joined the people's communes. After the establishment of the people's communes, they have shown great superiority in accelerating socialist construction in Xinjiang, organizing the production and life of all ethnic groups, and enhancing the unity and mutual assistance of all ethnic groups, and thus have been warmly supported by the people of all ethnic groups. Undoubtedly, with the improvement and consolidation of the people's communes, they will bring greater prosperity and happiness to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. (Applause)

Now, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, together with the people of the whole country, are confidently marching valiantly along the road of socialist construction. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and with the support of all fraternal provinces and regions, the people of Xinjiang will work even harder in the future and will surely achieve greater success in all aspects of developing socialist construction. We plan to produce 100,000 tons of steel in the entire autonomous region in 1959, an increase of 185.7 percent over last year, produce 10 billion jin of grain, an increase of 56.2 percent over last year, produce 3 million dan of cotton, a double increase over last year, and the total number of livestock will reach 24.73 million heads, an increase of 11.2 percent over last year. In order to achieve the above requirements, we must vigorously carry out mass movements, vigorously carry out technological revolution, rectify and consolidate people's communes, and further promote the magnificent upsurge of industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production, and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. (Applause)

The important experiences gained by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang in their work over the past few years: First, we must consolidate the unity of the motherland and strengthen national unity; Second, we must resolutely carry out social reforms; Third, we must resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party

In recent years, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have gained many very important experiences in their work, mainly: First, we must consolidate the unity of the motherland and strengthen national unity. All ethnic groups must be closely united in the unified big family of the motherland, helping each other in the same boat, so that minority nationalities can prosper and develop. At the same time, without the help of the Central Committee and the Han people in minority areas, it is impossible to rapidly develop economic and cultural construction. The vigorous development of economic and cultural construction in Xinjiang since liberation has been achieved precisely because the people of all ethnic groups unite and help each other, fight together, especially with the strong help of the Han people. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang feel more and more deeply the warmth and happiness of living in the big family of the motherland. It must be recognized that the division of the motherland and national separation will only benefit imperialism and be detrimental to minority nationalities. In order to enslave and divide and rule the working people of minority nationalities, imperialists always carry out activities with various deceptive tricks. Imperialism often achieves its goals through bourgeois local nationalism. There have also been such reactionary activities in Xinjiang in the past. In 1957, bourgeois rightists and local nationalists took advantage of our Party's rectification movement to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, making trouble for separation and opposing the Han people. These sinful activities of theirs aroused the incomparable anger of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The people of all ethnic groups ruthlessly exposed and thoroughly smashed this conspiracy activity of local nationalist elements, strengthened the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, thereby promoting the great development of socialist construction.

Second, we must resolutely carry out social reforms (democratic reforms and socialist transformations). Social reform is the only way for all ethnic groups, especially minority nationalities, to develop and progress, rapidly join the ranks of socialism, and get rid of poverty and backwardness. Only by changing the old and backward social system and establishing a socialist social system can the productive forces be completely liberated. Without carrying out social reforms and without changing the slave ownership system, the feudal ownership system, and the capitalist ownership system, there is no way to talk about socialist construction. Why can Xinjiang successfully implement the first five-year plan and carry out socialist construction like the rest of the country? How did the people of Xinjiang change the very backward state of the past? Before liberation, Xinjiang had almost no industry, only twelve small, extremely outdated handicraft-style factories. Agricultural productivity was very low, with 70 to 80 percent of the land concentrated in the hands of a few landlords, and livestock concentrated in the hands of a few herdlords. The old society's feudal ruling class, bureaucrats, landlords, herdlords, bandits, and bullies colluded with each other, exploiting and oppressing the masses. Farmers and herdsmen worked hard all year round but could not get rid of the suffering of hunger and poverty. Farmers and herdsmen had very low production enthusiasm, and productivity stagnated for a long time and could not be improved. After liberation, on the basis of stabilizing order and establishing political power, democratic reforms were vigorously carried out, rent reduction, opposing bullies, eliminating bandits, implementing land reform, and eliminating the feudal class. From 1953 to 1954, the mutual aid and cooperation movement was carried out throughout Xinjiang, implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, liberating the productive forces and promoting the great development of production, and overfulfilling the first five-year plan. By the end of 1958, there were 1,166 modern large- and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises, and more than 36 million mu of cultivated land (double the amount at the time of liberation). There has been a great increase in industrial products and grain. In 1949, the average person had only 447 jin of grain, and in 1958, the average person had 1,093 jin of grain. Obviously, without democratic reforms and socialist transformations, it would be impossible to achieve these achievements.

Third, we must resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party. The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all revolutionary and construction undertakings. Without the leadership of the Party, it would be fundamentally impossible to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidate the unity of all ethnic groups, train cadres of all ethnic groups, carry out democratic reforms, socialist transformations, and socialist construction. Especially since the various minority nationalities in our country have long been ruled by imperialism and feudal forces, and their politics, economy, and culture are very backward, without the leadership of the Party, it is impossible for the various minority nationalities to get rid of their backward state and join the ranks of advanced nationalities in the economic and cultural fields. The actual experience of the people of all ethnic groups in our country over the past nine years has fully proved this. (Warm applause)

Warning imperialism! Warning those in our neighboring countries who interfere in our internal affairs! Warning a small handful of separatists at home! Any of your conspiracies and tricks are in vain, and the result is just a bubble.

Representatives, I, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, completely agree with Premier Zhou's report, resolutely support the Central Committee's complete suppression of the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion in Tibet, and resolutely support the measures concerning the Tibet issue in Premier Zhou's report. The people of all ethnic groups in our country must safeguard the unity of the motherland and must strengthen national unity. No imperialism is allowed to interfere in China's internal affairs, and no foreigner is allowed to interfere in all matters, large and small, within the Chinese people. (Prolonged warm applause) The 650 million people of all ethnic groups in our country, who are jointly striving for a happier and more prosperous life, will surely shatter any conspiracy of imperialism. (Warm applause) We warn imperialism, warn those in our neighboring countries who want to interfere in our internal affairs, warn a small handful of separatists at home, any of your conspiracies and tricks against China are in vain, and the result is just a bubble! As the Uygur proverb says, "No matter how much the dog barks, it can't stop the traveler." The people of all ethnic groups in China will surely unite more closely and enter the great socialist and communist society with one heart and one mind. (Prolonged warm applause)

    中国内部事务决不允许外国人插手
    赛福鼎代表的发言各位代表，各位同志：
    我完全同意周恩来总理，李富春、李先念副总理，彭真副委员长的报告。周恩来总理的报告全面地总结了第一届全国人民代表大会期间，特别是一九五八年我国社会主义建设事业大跃进的辉煌成就和经验，同时指出了一九五九年政治、经济和文化教育战线上的任务。这个报告将大大地鼓舞全国人民更加奋发努力，促进社会主义建设更大更好更全面的跃进。周总理在报告中讲到我国政治生活问题时，用具体事例指出我国人民民主专政的巩固和各族人民的紧密团结，同时也讲到了西藏问题，这是非常正确的，我完全同意。
    帝国主义一贯收买利用各民族中的败类，企图破坏祖国统一，破坏民族团结，但都遭到失败。帝国主义和外国反动派也不会在西藏问题上得到什么好处
    “祖国的统一是全国各民族的最高利益”。任何帝国主义和反动分子企图破坏我们祖国的统一，必然会受到我们祖国各族人民的坚决回击。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团在帝国主义和外国反动派的支持下，发动了破坏祖国统一和民族团结的反革命叛乱，劫持达赖喇嘛逃往印度，最近，并且以达赖喇嘛的名义，发表了颠倒黑白的所谓声明。对此，新疆各族人民表示无限的愤慨。（热烈鼓掌）
    帝国主义侵略我国一贯所用的卑鄙伎俩，就是要收买、利用各民族中的败类，企图制造所谓“独立”，以便达到他们破坏祖国统一和民族团结的目的，这种事例，过去在我国的不少民族中曾经发生过，但是这些企图都遭到了失败。
    在新疆，帝国主义在清朝同治年间，曾收买和利用过阿古柏等制造反对祖国的叛乱。在临解放前又收买和利用过麦斯乌德、伊敏·艾沙，这一类民族败类去为他们充当走狗，这些人为了掩盖他们出卖祖国和民族利益的丑恶面目，也提出所谓民族独立的口号。历史对这些可耻败类作了最公正的裁判。（鼓掌）大家知道，像伊敏·艾沙等人最后不得不逃往外国跑到他们的主子那里，成为仰人鼻息的可怜虫，西藏叛乱分子，难道会有别的出路吗？（热烈鼓掌）
    帝国主义破坏我国统一和民族团结的阴谋，既然过去不能实现，我国人民在中国共产党领导下，已经更加紧密的团结起来的今天根本不可能达到它们的目的；事实上西藏的叛乱已经基本上平息了。我们相信，西藏人民在祖国各民族的帮助和支持下，不要很久将会把西藏建设成为民主的社会主义的新西藏。（鼓掌）
    帝国主义和外国反动派是不会在西藏问题上得到什么好处的。我们希望达赖喇嘛能摆脱被控制的处境，回到祖国来。热烈鼓掌）
    新疆维吾尔自治区胜利地超额完成了第一个五年计划，改变了解放前的贫困落后面貌
    我国各少数民族必须团结在祖国的大家庭中，必须依靠党的领导，执行党的民族政策，才能摆脱贫困落后境地，才能求得政治经济文化的迅速发展。这是几年来我国各少数民族地区建设经验已经证明了的。各少数民族地区政治经济文化发展的事实，也是任何帝国主义和反动分子抹煞不了的。新疆维吾尔自治区的建设成就也完全证明了这一点。（鼓掌）
    新疆维吾尔自治区在中央和毛主席的领导和帮助下，在第一届全国人民代表大会期间，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的史无前例的巨大成就。在这期间，进行了民主改革和社会主义改造，促进了工农牧业生产的发展。到一九五七年底，胜利地完成和超额完成了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，同一九五二年比较，工农业总产值增长百分之八十四点七二，粮食产量增长百分之二十六点六三，牲畜增长百分之四十六点四三，文教卫生事业也有了很大发展。随着经济文教卫生事业的发展，人民生活得到了显著的改善，人民购买力较一九五二年增长一点二倍。这就大大地改变了新疆解放以前那种贫困落后的面貌。（热烈鼓掌）
    一九五八年，同样是新疆社会主义建设大跃进的一年。在这一年里，新疆各族人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，干劲冲天，促进了各项建设事业的大发展，工农业总产值比一九五七年增长了百分之四十五点五一。在农业生产方面，扩大灌溉面积六百六十一万亩，开荒五百六十二万亩，粮食总产量达到六十四亿斤，比一九五七年增长百分之五十七点三，平均每人有粮食一千零九十三斤。棉花总产量达到一百四十七万担，比一九五七年增长百分之五十一；油料总产量达到一亿八千五百万斤，比一九五七年增长百分之二十七点四。畜牧业生产也获得了迅速发展。工业方面，在以钢为纲全民大办工业的高潮中，有百余万干部和群众战斗在钢铁战线上。在几个月的时间内，即夺得了十八万二千多吨铁，三万五千多吨钢的巨大胜利。文化教育卫生事业也有了很大发展。全自治区有高等学校五所，中等学校二百零六所，农业学校一千多所，小学四千五百三十四所，在校学生八十余万人，小学教育已基本上普及了。在全国人民公社化运动的影响下，在自治区社会主义建设大跃进的基础上，去年秋季农村中普遍实现了人民公社化。牧业区也有百分之七十以上的牧民加入了人民公社。人民公社成立后，在加速新疆社会主义建设、组织各族人民的生产和生活以及增强各民族团结互助等方面已经显示了极大的优越性，因而获得了各族人民的热烈拥护。无疑的，随着人民公社的健全和巩固，它必将给新疆各族人民带来更大的繁荣和幸福。（鼓掌）
    现在，新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民和全国人民一起正满怀信心地沿着社会主义建设的道路英勇地迈进。我们深信，在党中央和毛主席的领导下与全国各兄弟省、区的支援下，新疆地区人民今后将更加努力，一定能够在发展社会主义建设的各个方面工作中取得更大的成绩。我们计划全自治区一九五九年生产钢十万吨，比去年增长百分之一百八十五点七，生产粮食一百亿斤，比去年增长百分之五十六点二，生产棉花三百万担，比去年增长一倍，牲畜总头数达到二千四百七十三万头，比去年增长百分之十一点二。为了实现上述要求，必须大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命，整顿和巩固人民公社，进一步推进波澜壮阔的工农牧业生产高潮，实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进。（鼓掌）
    几年来新疆各族人民在工作中取得的重要经验：第一，必须巩固祖国统一，加强民族团结；第二，必须坚决地进行社会改革；第三，必须坚决依靠党的领导
    几年来，新疆各族人民在工作中取得了许多非常重要的经验，主要是：第一，必须巩固祖国统一，加强民族团结。各民族必须紧密地团结在统一的祖国大家庭里，和衷共济，少数民族才能繁荣和发展。同时在少数民族地区如果没有中央和汉族人民帮助，要迅速发展经济文化建设是不可能的。解放以来，新疆经济文化建设事业的蓬勃发展，正是由于各族人民团结互助，共同斗争，特别是在汉族人民的大力帮助下获得的。新疆各族人民愈来愈深切地感到生活在祖国大家庭中的温暖和幸福。必须认清：祖国分裂、民族分离，只会对帝国主义有利，而对少数民族不利。帝国主义和反动分子为了对少数民族劳动人民进行奴役、分而治之，总是用各种骗人的伎俩进行活动。帝国主义往往通过资产阶级地方民族主义达到自己的目的。新疆过去也有过这样的反动活动。一九五七年资产阶级右派和地方民族主义分子趁我党开展整风运动之际，向党发动了猖狂进攻，闹分离，反汉族。他们的这些罪恶活动，激起了新疆各族人民的无比愤怒。各族人民无情地揭露和彻底地粉碎了地方民族主义分子的这种阴谋活动，加强了各族人民的团结，从而促进了社会主义建设大发展。
    第二，必须坚决地进行社会改革（民主改革和社会主义改造）。社会改革是各族人民特别是少数民族得以发展进步，迅速跻于社会主义行列，摆脱贫困落后的必由之路。只有改变旧的落后的社会制度，建立起社会主义的社会制度，才能彻底解放生产力。不进行社会改革，不改变奴隶所有制、封建所有制和资本主义所有制，就根本谈不到社会主义建设。新疆为什么能够像全国一样胜利地实现第一个五年计划和进行社会主义建设的呢？新疆人民是怎样改变了过去那种非常落后的状态的呢？新疆在解放前几乎可以说没有什么工业，只有十二个小型的设备极其陈旧的手工业式的工厂。农业生产力很低，百分之七十到八十的土地集中在少数地主手中，牲畜都集中在少数牧主手中。旧社会封建统治阶级、官僚、地主、牧主、土匪、恶霸相互勾结、剥削和压榨群众。农牧民终岁勤劳摆不脱饥寒贫困的痛苦。农牧民生产情绪很低，生产力长期停滞不能提高。解放后，在安定秩序建立政权的基础上，大力进行了民主改革，减租、反对恶霸、消灭土匪、实行土地改革，消灭了封建阶级。一九五三年至一九五四年，全疆开展了互助合作运动，实行对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，解放了生产力，促进了生产大发展，超额完成了第一个五年计划。到一九五八年底，现代化大、中型工矿企业已达一千一百六十六个，耕地三千六百多万亩（比解放时增加了一倍）。工业产品和粮食都有很大的增长。一九四九年每人平均只有粮食四百四十七斤，一九五八年每人就有粮食一千零九十三斤。显然，没有民主改革和社会主义改造，要获得这些成就是不可能的。
    第三，必须坚决依靠党的领导。中国共产党的领导是一切革命和建设事业获得胜利的根本保证。如果没有党的领导，要想巩固人民民主专政、巩固各民族团结、培养各民族干部、进行民主改革、社会主义改造和社会主义建设是根本不可能的。尤其是我们中国的各少数民族长期受着帝国主义、封建势力的统治，政治经济和文化都很落后，没有党的领导，各少数民族就不可能摆脱落后状态，在经济、文化方面跻于先进民族行列。我国各少数民族人民在过去九年多的实际体验，充分证明了这一点。（热烈鼓掌）
    警告帝国主义！警告我国邻邦的那些干涉我国内政的人！警告国内一小撮分离主义分子！你们的任何阴谋诡计，都是枉费心机，结果只是一个泡影而已
    各位代表：我代表新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民完全同意周总理的报告，坚决拥护中央彻底平息西藏反革命武装叛乱，并坚决拥护周总理报告中关于西藏问题的措施。我国各族人民必须维护祖国统一，必须增强民族团结。决不允许任何帝国主义干涉中国内政，中国人民内部的一切大小事务，决不允许任何外国人插手。（长时间的热烈鼓掌）正在为更加幸福美满的生活而共同奋斗的我国六亿五千万各族人民，一定会粉碎帝国主义的任何阴谋。（热烈鼓掌）我们警告帝国主义，警告我国邻邦那些想干涉我国内部事务的人，警告国内的一小撮分离主义分子，你们对中国的任何阴谋诡计都是枉费心机的，其结果只不过是一个泡影而已！正像维吾尔谚语所说：“尽管狗狂吠，难挡行路人”。中国各族人民一定会更加紧密团结，万众一心地共同进入伟大的社会主义和共产主义社会。  （长时间的热烈鼓掌）
