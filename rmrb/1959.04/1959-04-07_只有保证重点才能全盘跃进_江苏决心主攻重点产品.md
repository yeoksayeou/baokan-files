Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 6th – Since entering the second quarter, the million workers on Jiangsu Province's industrial and transportation front, under the guidance of the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," are concentrating their efforts and fiercely attacking key points, determined to fight a beautiful "war of annihilation" in this quarter.

The provincial industrial cadre meeting held in late March has made arrangements for this battle and sounded the bugle call for the advance.

Jiangsu Province overfulfilled the original planned output value by 0.8% in the first quarter, and the completion of several major products, such as pig iron and steel, was also relatively good. The task for the second quarter is even more arduous, especially for some key products such as steel, steel products, coal, and machinery, the tasks are greatly increased compared with the first quarter. In order to concentrate forces, strive for the initiative, and achieve a greater leap forward on the premise of ensuring key points, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee promptly convened an industrial cadre meeting at the end of the first quarter, attended by more than 2,800 cadres from various industry systems and factory and mining enterprises, to fully discuss and arrange the production tasks for the second quarter.

The meeting first conducted education on "the whole country as one chessboard" among all the cadres present. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that completing the national plan and ensuring key tasks are the highest interests and greatest glory of the people of the province, and also the key to whether the second-quarter production plan can be completed. The meeting spent five days, both theoretically and practically, repeatedly discussing this issue, and further realized that only by ensuring that the key points are passed first can the overall leap forward be driven. Everyone expressed that they must give full play to their high degree of consciousness, initiative, and tenacity, and first strive for the completion of the national plan and for the victory of the overall situation. The prominent focus of the province in the second quarter is to grasp the production of steel, steel products, and coal, as well as the manufacture and supporting of mining, steel rolling, irrigation and drainage, and other mechanical equipment related to steel, coal, grain, and cotton production. In order to ensure the completion of these key tasks, the meeting believed that it is necessary to concentrate forces in the following five aspects to fight a good "war of annihilation":

First, concentrate leadership. Under the leadership of the Provincial Production Committee, key departments such as steel, coal, and machinery should set up special lines for special management, unified leadership of the production and capital construction of these departments, planning, measures, products, and materials should be grasped to the end. For key enterprises and key units, every steelmaking furnace, every mine, every coal mining face, every steel rolling mill, and every key equipment should be assigned cadres to take charge of it, grasp the product progress every day, and discover and solve problems at any time.

Second, concentrate basic construction investment and first ensure that national key projects are launched as early as possible. The key projects that have already been launched should be accelerated to bring investment effects into play as soon as possible.

Third, strengthen the control of raw materials. Raw materials should first be used for product projects allocated by the state, and special materials should be used for special purposes. If raw materials are not delivered in time or the allocation is insufficient, efforts should also be made to adopt methods such as advance use, clearing of warehouses, saving, and organizing material exchanges to first ensure that key points are "fed" and complete key tasks on time, in quantity, and with quality.

Fourth, concentrate technical equipment strength to ensure the completion of the six major equipment tasks. Under unified planning, organize collaboration within the city to address the weak links in equipment and technical strength. Promote the experience of large factories and small factories in Wuxi City, city-owned factories and district-owned factories, foundries and power engine factories, and diesel engine factories and internal combustion engine factories to carry out comprehensive production collaboration to accelerate the completion of equipment sets.

Fifth, uniformly adjust and arrange labor, support key construction units, and support newly built key enterprises.

According to the above spirit, cadres from all walks of life and systems attending the meeting have respectively arranged and revised the plans for the second quarter, so that each key project is rooted, each plan and measure is implemented, and the arrangements are made to the factory and mining enterprises. Some non-key industries and enterprises are also doing everything possible to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, tap the potential of local resources, and formulate active leap forward plans on the premise of serving the overall situation.

The meeting also focused on studying how to improve labor productivity. Everyone believed in the discussion that the main way in this regard is to vigorously carry out technical revolution and gradually improve manual operations to semi-mechanized and mechanized operations. In this regard, many large and small factories and mines in Jiangsu Province still have great potential to be tapped.

    只有保证重点才能全盘跃进
    江苏决心主攻重点产品
    据新华社南京6日电　进入第二季度以来，江苏省工业交通战线的百万职工在“全国一盘棋”的方针指导下，正在集中力量，猛攻重点，决心在这个季度打好漂亮的“歼灭战”。
    3月下旬召开的全省工业干部会议，已为这场战斗作了部署，吹响了进军的号角。
    江苏省第一季度超额0.8％完成了原订产值计划，几项主要产品中，生铁和钢材也完成得较好。第二季度任务更加艰巨，特别是一些重点产品如钢铁、钢材、煤炭、机械等，任务都比第一季度大大增加。为了集中力量，争取主动，在确保重点的前提下，实现更大的跃进，中共江苏省委在第一季度末及时召开了由各行业系统和各厂矿企业二千八百多干部参加的工业干部会议，充分讨论和安排了第二季度的生产任务。
    会议首先在全体到会干部中进行了“全国一盘棋”的教育。省委指出，完成国家计划，保证重点任务，是全省人民的最高利益和最大光荣，同时也是能否完成二季度生产计划的关键所在。会议以五天时间，既务虚，又务实，反复地讨论了这一问题，进一步认识到只有先保证重点过关，才能带动全盘跃进。大家表示一定要发挥高度的自觉性、积极性和顽强性，首先为全国计划的完成而奋斗，为全局的胜利而奋斗。全省第二季度突出的重点是抓钢、钢材和煤炭的生产，以及同钢、煤、粮、棉生产有关的采矿、轧钢、排灌等机械设备的制造和配套。为了确保这些重点任务的完成，会议认为必须从以下五个方面集中力量，打好“歼灭战”：
    第一，集中领导力量。在省的生产委员会领导下，钢铁、煤炭、机械等重点部门设专线专管，统一领导这些部门的生产和基本建设，计划、措施、产品、材料一竿子抓到底。凡是重点企业、重点单位，每一个炼钢炉，每一座矿井，每一个采煤工作面，每一部轧钢机，每一套重点设备，都指定干部专人专管，每天抓产品进度，随时发现和解决问题。
    第二，集中基本建设投资，首先保证国家重点项目及早上马。已上马的重点项目，要加快速度，尽快地发挥投资效果。
    第三，加强对原材料的控制。原材料要首先用在国家分配的产品项目上，实行专料专用。原材料未及时下达或调拨不足的，也要千方百计地采取垫用、清仓、节约和组织物资交流等办法，首先保证重点
  “吃饱”，按期按量按质地完成重点任务。
    第四，集中技术设备力量，确保六大设备任务的完成。在统一计划下，针对设备和技术力量的薄弱环节，在全市范围内组织协作。推广无锡市大厂与小厂，市属厂与区属厂，铸件厂与动力机厂，柴油机厂与内燃机厂开展全面生产大协作的经验，加速设备成套。
    第五，统一调整和安排劳动力，支援重点建设单位，支援新建的重点企业。
    根据上述精神，到会的各行各业各系统的干部，都分别安排和修订了第二季度的计划，使个个重点项目扎根，条条计划措施落实，一竿子布置到厂矿企业。一些非重点行业和企业，也在服从大局的前提下，千方百计地开源节流，挖掘地方资源潜力，订出了积极的跃进计划。
    这次会议还着重研究了怎样提高劳动生产率的问题。大家在讨论中认为，这方面的主要途径是大搞技术革命，把手工操作逐步提高到半机械化和机械化操作。这方面，江苏省的许多大小厂矿，还大有潜力可挖。
