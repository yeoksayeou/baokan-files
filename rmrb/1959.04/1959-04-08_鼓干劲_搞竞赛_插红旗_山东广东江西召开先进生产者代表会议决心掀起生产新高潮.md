    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: The eight-day Shandong Province Industrial, Basic Construction, and Transportation Departments' Active Socialist Construction Representatives Meeting has concluded. The one thousand representatives attending the meeting unanimously stated that they would work with all the province's workers to push the red flag competition movement, centered on the technological revolution, to a new high with even greater enthusiasm.

    Based on the spirit of stirring up enthusiasm, pointing out directions, making proposals, conducting competitions, and planting red flags, this meeting, through general sessions, visits to exhibitions, and mutual visits, widely exchanged advanced ideas and advanced experiences. At the meeting, the Shandong Provincial People's Committee Experimental Iron Smelting Plant introduced its experiences in increasing pig iron production and quality, reducing costs and coke consumption; Sun Qiming Excavation Team of Zibo Xihe Coal Mine introduced its experiences in vigorously promoting the technological revolution, thereby rapidly increasing the excavation speed by three times; Xu Cheng, a technical innovation expert and ironworker from Qingdao Wood Comprehensive Processing Plant who has been fully employed without accidents for seven years, Zhang Fangwen, a locomotive driver from Jinan Railway Bureau Yanzhou Locomotive Depot who "travels thousands of stations without delay", and Qu Shuzi, a young female worker from Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Plant who completed three years and nine months of work in one year, also introduced their advanced experiences at the meeting. These advanced experiences and advanced deeds greatly encouraged the representatives' revolutionary enthusiasm and high morale. They stated that they would immediately launch an even greater upsurge of "learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced" to ensure that they complete and over fulfill production plans daily, ten-day period by ten-day period, monthly by monthly, and quarterly by quarterly along with all the province's workers.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: "Show soaring enthusiasm, create more and better achievements, and dedicate them to the National Socialist Construction Advanced Collective and Advanced Producer Representatives Meeting," is the call issued to all the province's workers by the 1,500 representatives of the Guangdong Province Second Industrial and Mining and Transportation Enterprises Advanced Producer Representatives Meeting.

    This unprecedented gathering of heroes in Guangdong Province's industrial system was held in Guangzhou. During the meeting, the representatives were greatly encouraged by the news of the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to convene the National Socialist Construction Advanced Collective and Advanced Producer Representatives Meeting. Everyone enthusiastically expressed their intention to respond to the call with practical actions. That evening and the next day, many units and representatives wrote proposals, guarantees, and letters of determination. Many units and industries revised their original plans and re-formulated more advanced targets and measures. Dozens of representatives from the fuel industry system held meetings overnight to discuss and decided to accelerate the construction of coal industrial bases to produce more and better coal. The proposals from all the metallurgical and steel representatives and sugar industry representatives stated that they would complete their plans without missing a single catty or a single ounce, and strive to complete their tasks ahead of schedule and over fulfill them. The attending representatives unanimously stated that in addition to maintaining their advanced status and striving for greater achievements, they would also unite all workers and quickly launch a vigorous new upsurge in production to welcome the National Heroes Meeting.

    This meeting unfolded wide-ranging activities of exchanging advanced experiences and advanced technologies through methods such as visits and on-site meetings. A total of forty-four on-site meetings were organized during the meeting, exchanging 131 major advanced experiences. The representatives believed that these experiences would play a huge role in solving the current key to production and promoting the technological revolution.

    Our newspaper, Nanchang, 7th: Launch a red flag competition to ensure a 50% increase in labor productivity, increase the province's total industrial output value by 70% compared to last year, and strive to go to Beijing after the autumn harvest to present a gift to Chairman Mao. This is the common vow of the more than 1,700 representatives who recently attended the Jiangxi Province Industrial Advanced Units and Advanced Individuals Representatives Meeting.

    The Jiangxi Province Industrial Advanced Units and Advanced Individuals Representatives Meeting is a mobilization meeting to march toward a new upsurge in industrial production. Under the direct guidance of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the participating representatives, through airing views, debates, and extensive exchange of advanced experiences, have greatly improved their ideological understanding of achieving a greater leap forward this year. At the meeting, everyone was ambitious and full of fighting spirit, determined to make a big effort this year. Liu Benkun, who pioneered the national record for the highest coal mining with pneumatic picks, and Cai Youqing, an advanced worker from Hongdu Machinery Factory, proposed a competition target of one person equaling four people to all workers in the province. As soon as this target was proposed, Fu Daxiang, a lathe operator from Jinggangshan Machinery Factory, immediately challenged, guaranteeing to surpass Cai Youqing. At the same time, Huang Side and Fan Jizeng, tunneling workers from Fengcheng Coal Mine, also proposed not only to learn from Liu Benkun, but also to surpass Liu Benkun. Representatives from the metallurgical, coal, machinery, textile and other industrial systems who attended the meeting also made proposals to the workers in their respective industries, requesting all workers to work together. The high enthusiasm of challenging and responding to challenges at the meeting has also aroused enthusiastic reactions among the broad masses of workers and staff throughout the province. There was mutual echoing inside and outside the meeting, and a competition upsurge quickly swept across the province.
