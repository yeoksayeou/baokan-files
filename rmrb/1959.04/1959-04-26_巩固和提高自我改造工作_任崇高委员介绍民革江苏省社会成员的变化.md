Consolidate and Improve Self-Remolding Work
Committee Member Ren Chonggao Introduces Changes in the Social Composition of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Jiangsu Province

Chairman, esteemed committee members:

I express my warm support for Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's national economic plan report, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's financial budget report, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Now, I will present a report to the committee members on the changes in the social composition of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Jiangsu Province.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Jiangsu are primarily former high- and mid-level military and political personnel of the Kuomintang. Among them, social members, that is, members scattered throughout society, account for approximately 40% of the total membership. Their current ages are relatively advanced. Their past education was bourgeois, feudal, and even influenced by fascism to some extent. Many served the feudal landlords and bureaucratic bourgeoisie for a long time, and some were even powerful figures of the reactionary faction. After liberation, most of them, due to not participating in regular study and practical struggle for a relatively long period, have not undergone very good remolding. I listened to Premier Zhou's statement in the government work report that after the anti-Rightist struggle, a relatively thorough rectification movement was also carried out among the members of various democratic parties, and many of them have made progress to varying degrees through study, work, and labor training. I deeply feel that the social members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Jiangsu are the same. Through the profound education of the great anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification and heart-to-heart movement, as well as the encouragement and promotion of the Great Leap Forward, they have also undergone certain changes in their political thinking and have taken a step forward; however, their intermediate state of duality still exists. This shows the long-term, arduous, and repetitive nature of remolding, which must be further strengthened on the existing basis.

(1) General ideological situation before the anti-Rightist rectification:

I. Dissatisfaction with the Party. They resisted and doubted the Party's various policies, such as the unified purchase and sale, planned supply, and private housing reform.

II. Resistance and aversion to the socialist system and the people's democratic dictatorship, believing that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the elimination of hidden counter-revolutionaries were excessive.

III. Displeasure with the new society, but不敢 (dare not) openly resist. Some consider themselves "old officials of the previous dynasty, ministers of a fallen state" and feel overwhelmed by the contrast between the past and the present.

IV. Very poor understanding of the nature, tasks, and role of democratic parties, with serious old democratic ideas.

The above ideological situations were fairly common problems among social members before the anti-Rightist rectification.

(2) Ideological changes after the anti-Rightist rectification:

I. A preliminary understanding of the Party's leadership.

They realized that "the Communist Party cannot be opposed, the capitalist road cannot be taken, and rightists cannot be." Only by following the Communist Party and taking the socialist road can there be a future. They realized that accepting the leadership of the residents' committee and actively participating in residents' work is specifically accepting the Party's leadership and serving the socialist cause. Therefore, many comrades can take the initiative to participate in residents' work and have a better performance. Some originally planned to move to escape residents' work, but now they can actively take action to strive for work and receive praise from the masses and be elected as the director of the residents' committee. Some actively participate in literacy work and also use practical actions of visiting early and late to deliver lessons, driving others and being rated as a provincial literacy model.

Regarding the attitude towards the Party's policies, they can generally respond to the call and translate it into practical action. In the private housing reform movement, they can take the lead in applying. Some vacated houses or took out furniture to support the civilian-run canteens and nurseries. Some donated rockeries or flowers and trees to support greening. Especially in the industrial drought resistance, a lot of steel and metal utensils were donated.

II. A preliminary understanding of their own reactionary class nature, with a conscious desire for remolding.

They said in their rectification ideological summaries: "Our past resistance to the Party has historical and class roots. The main reason is that we did not recognize our past reactionary nature. Through the heart-to-heart movement, we were greatly surprised. I am not only a bourgeois intellectual, but also a comprador bureaucratic bourgeois element. We often look at new things with an old perspective and fall far behind the times. If we do not strengthen remolding, we will still be rightists at the age of eighty." In the past, they also participated in some residents' work because they were afraid of the Communist Party and the masses of the people. "When a man is under the low eaves, he has to bow his head." After the rectification, they realized that participating in residents' work is a good thing for themselves to serve the people, their mood is also comfortable, and their enthusiasm has come.

III. They began to have an understanding and practice of labor.

In the past, they had never participated in or rarely participated in physical labor, considering themselves to be "people above people" and thinking that labor would demean their so-called "identity." Now, their understanding has improved, and many people can participate in various labors, such as knocking ore with the working people in the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking, and can persevere, with the most being able to knock up to 500 jin per day. Some insisted on working in front of the furnace and were rated as advanced workers. Six old comrades formed a fertilizer accumulation team and accumulated and delivered 4,700 jin of fertilizer in two and a half days. In the mass-run industries, many comrades participated in civilian-run factories for casting, hardware, native chemical fertilizers, motors, sewing, embroidery, etc. Many people also participated in various labor productions in grain stations, vegetable markets, canteens, livestock farms, and seedling farms. Some comrades also established art factories and foreign language translation agencies under the leadership of local Party and government.

IV. They have a clearer understanding of the nature, tasks, and role of democratic parties, thus laying a more conscious foundation for strengthening self-remolding and serving socialism. Most comrades can acknowledge that they have two sides in connection with their own class nature, and they are also convinced that democratic parties are still bourgeois political parties. They realize that the task of democratic parties is to represent the long-term interests of members and to help and educate members to strengthen their own fundamental remolding. Democratic parties can only play the role of the Party's assistant in one aspect under the leadership of the Party. Some comrades criticized the past mistakes of frequently seeking relief and arrangements, and thus began to learn and use criticism and self-criticism to strengthen self-remolding.

(3) The origin of achievements

The ideological changes of social members are significant, indicating that they can accept remolding and can also be remolded. This also shows that our past view of them of "one suspicion and two fears" was wrong. The reasons for the achievements are mainly the following aspects:

I. First of all, it is the Party's wise leadership and the appeal of the great policy. Under the promotion and encouragement of the Great Leap Forward, they have varying degrees of consciousness and have undergone different changes. They said, "Listening to a report from the Party is better than reading books for ten years," "The Party is more亲切 (intimate) than parents, and the Party comes to help specifically when my thoughts encounter obstacles," "If it were not for the Party's leadership, we would not know how many detours to take." They all felt that "There is nothing wrong with doing things according to the Party's policies."

II. Under the leadership of the Party, we implemented the Party's policy of unity, education, and remolding, and carried out a series of work, such as organizing them to study, visit, open forums, and run exhibitions. At the same time, we also conducted in-depth and detailed understanding of the situation and provided individual assistance. In our work, we used the methods of cultivating backbones, encouraging advanced, driving the general, and doing more representative figures. Especially in the anti-Rightist rectification, we constantly mobilized the masses to educate the masses to promote their self-remolding. Practice has proved that it is effective.

III. The efforts of the social members themselves. In the continuous study, mutual assistance, visits, and labor practice, they gradually realized the necessity of remolding, thus having the confidence and determination to remold, eliminating some old and depressed emotions, and their mood gradually brightened.

In short, in the past few years, their ideological situation has changed for the better, which is basic and main; however, the development is unbalanced, and there is a lot of repetition. It is still an intermediate state, and there are still two sides.

(4) Basic requirements for current work

Based on the above situation, we believe that the basic requirements for the current work are to consolidate and improve the existing changes. Take a step forward and consolidate a step. This requires thoroughly implementing the policy of combining service and remolding, mobilizing their positive factors, and helping them further recognize the glory of labor and doing a good job in residents' mass work, which is specifically serving the socialist cause, and residents' organizations are good bases for self-remolding. Implement the remolding path of combining politics and ideology as the commander, the socialist work post as the base, and labor and business practice as the foundation. Continue to cultivate typical examples, summarize and promote good experiences to improve members' awareness of remolding, which specifically embodies the correctness of the policy of combining service and remolding. In order to further improve members' awareness of strengthening self-remolding and to make them feel comfortable, we must focus on studying the ways and methods in our work, and carry out in-depth, meticulous, gentle, and drizzle-like political and ideological education work. Using the method of combining encouragement and criticism, encourage their enthusiasm and criticize their negativity, which will achieve certain results. At the same time, we must pay special attention to strengthening the work of members who are more representative so that they can influence and promote the progress of general members, which will be of great help to our work.

Finally, please criticize and correct, and wish
The conference a victorious success! Good health to all committee members!

### 巩固和提高自我改造工作  任崇高委员介绍民革江苏省社会成员的变化

专栏：

    巩固和提高自我改造工作
    任崇高委员介绍民革江苏省社会成员的变化主席、各位委员：
    我对周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理的国民经济计划报告、李先念副总理的财政决算预算报告、彭真副委员长的人大常委工作报告、以及李维汉副主席的政协常委工作报告，表示热烈拥护。
    现在我将民革江苏省社会成员变化情况，向各位委员作一个汇报。
    民革江苏成员，主要是原国民党中上层旧军政人员，其中社会成员，也就是散布在社会上的成员，约占成员总数的百分之四十。他们现有的年龄，都是比较大的。他们过去所受的教育，都是资产阶级的、封建的、甚至还受了些法西斯的影响。很多是长期为封建地主、官僚资产阶级服务的，有不少还是反动派的当权人物。解放后，他们当中的大多数，由于在较长时期内，没有参加经常的学习和实际斗争的锻炼，因而还没有得到很好的改造。我听了周总理在政府工作报告中说：经过反右派斗争以后，在各民主党派成员中间，也进行了比较深入的整风运动，他们中许多人通过学习、工作和劳动锻炼，有了不同程度的进步。深深感到江苏民革的社会成员也一样。他们在通过伟大的反右斗争和整风、交心运动的深刻教育，以及大跃进形势的鼓舞、推动，在政治思想上也是有了一定转变，前进了一步；但其中间状态的两面性仍然存在。这说明改造的长期性、艰巨性和反复性，须在现有基础上继续加强改造。
    （一）反右整风前一般的思想情况
    一、对党不满意。对党的各项方针政策都有抵触，有怀疑，如对统购统销，计划供应，私房改造等。
    二、对社会主义制度和人民民主专政抵触反感，认为镇反、肃反搞得过火了。
    三、对新社会不顺眼，但又不敢公开反抗，有以“前朝遗老、亡国大夫”自居，有不胜今昔之感。
    四、对民主党派的性质、任务和作用，认识很差，有严重的旧民主主义思想。
    以上这些思想情况，在反右整风以前，在社会成员中，是相当普遍存在的问题。
    （二）反右整风以后的思想变化
    一、对党的领导有了初步的认识。
    他们认识到“共产党反不得，资本主义道路走不得，右派当不得”，只有跟着共产党走，走社会主义道路，才有前途。他们认识到接受居民委员会的领导，积极参加居民工作，就是具体接受党的领导，为社会主义事业服务。因而有很多同志，都能主动争取参加居民工作，并有较好的表现，有人原拟搬家来逃避居民工作的，现在能以积极行动争取工作，并得到群众的好评，被推为居民委员会主任。有的积极参加扫盲工作，还以早晚登门送课的实际行动带动了别人，被评为省级扫盲模范。
    在对待党的方针政策的态度上，一般也都能响应号召，并见之实际行动。在私房改造运动中，能主动带头申请。有的腾出房子或拿出家具，支援民办食堂，托儿所。有的献了假山石或花木，支援绿化。特别在工业抗旱中，献出了不少钢铁和金属用具。
    二、初步认识了自己的反动阶级本质，有自觉改造的要求。
    他们在整风思想小结中说：“我们过去对党抵触，都有历史根源和阶级根源的，主要是不认识自己过去反动本质，通过交心运动大吃一惊，我不仅是资产阶级知识分子，而且是买办官僚资产阶级分子，往往以老眼光看新事物，掉在时代后面一大节，不加强改造，八十岁还要当右派”。他们过去也曾参加一些居民工作，是因为怕共产党，怕人民群众，“人在矮檐下，不得不低头”，整风以后，认识到参加居民工作，是自己为人民服务的好事情，心情也舒畅了，劲头也来了。
    三、他们开始对劳动有了认识和实践。
    他们过去从未参加或很少参加过体力劳动，以“人上人”自居，认为劳动有失自己的所谓“身份”。现在，他们的认识提高了，不少人能参加各项劳动、如在大炼钢铁中，他们能与劳动人民在一起敲矿石，并能坚持不懈，最多的每天能敲到五百斤。有的人坚持炉前工作，被评为先进工作者。有六位老同志自编为一个积肥小组，两天半就积肥送肥四千七百斤。在群众大办工业中，有不少同志，都分别参加进翻砂、五金、土化肥、马达、缝纫、刺绣等民办工厂中去。还有不少人参加了粮站、菜场、食堂、畜牧场、育苗场的各种劳动生产。还有些同志并在地方党和政府的领导下，办了美术工厂和外文翻译社。
    四、对民主党派的性质、任务和作用，有了比较明确的认识，从而对加强自我改造和为社会主义服务，也有了一些自觉的基础。多数同志能联系自己的阶级本质承认自己有两面性，对民主党派仍然是资产阶级性的政党也服气了。认识到民主党派的任务，就是代表成员的长远利益，帮助与教育成员加强自我根本改造。民主党派只有在党的领导下，才能发挥党的一方面的助手作用。有些同志就批判了过去经常闹救济安排的错误，从而也开始学习和运用批评与自我批评，来加强自我改造。
    （三）成绩的由来
    社会成员的思想变化是显著的，说明他们可以接受改造，也是能够改造的。这也说明我们过去对他们的“一嫌二怕”的看法是不对头的。取得成绩的原因，主要有以下几方面：
    一、首先是党的英明领导和伟大政策的感召，在大跃进形势的推动和鼓舞下，促使他们有了不同程度的自觉，起了不同的变化。他们说“听党一报告，胜读十年书”，“党比父母还亲切，我的思想遇有障碍，党就来具体帮助”，“要不是党的领导，我们不晓得要走多少弯路”。他们一致感到：“按照党的方针政策办事，没有错的”。
    二、我们在党的领导下贯彻执行党的团结、教育、改造方针，进行了一系列工作，如组织他们学习、参观、访问、开座谈会、办展览会等，同时还深入细致的了解情况，进行个别帮助。在工作中，我们运用了培养骨干，鼓励先进，带动一般和多做代表性人物的方法。特别在反右整风中，不断地发动群众，以群众教育群众，来推动他们加强自我改造，实践证明，都是有效果的。
    三、社会成员本身的努力。在不断的学习互助，参观访问和劳动实践中，他们逐步体会到改造的必要性，从而有了改造的信心与决心，消除一些年老消沉的情绪，心情逐渐开朗起来。
    总之，几年来，他们的思想情况，是向好的方面转化，这是基本的，主要的；但发展是不平衡的，而且有很大的反复性，还是中间状态，还有两面性。
    （四）当前工作的基本要求
    根据以上情况，我们认为当前工作的基本要求，是巩固和提高已有变化。前进一步，巩固一步，这就必须深入贯彻服务与改造相结合的方针，调动他们的积极因素，帮助他们进一步认识劳动的光荣和做好居民群众工作，就是具体为社会主义事业服务，居民组织就是自我改造的良好基地。贯彻以政治思想为统帅，以社会主义工作岗位为基地，以劳动和业务实践为基础三者相结合的改造途径。继续培养典型，总结和推广好的经验，以提高成员对改造的自觉性，这也就具体体现了服务与改造相结合这个方针的正确性。为了进一步提高成员加强自我改造的自觉性，做到心情舒畅，我们在工作中，必须着重努力研究方式方法，进行深入细致、和风细雨的政治思想教育工作。运用鼓励与批评相结合的方法，鼓励其积极性，批评其消极性，这样是会取得一定的效果的。同时要特别加强对代表性较大的成员的工作，使能影响和推动一般成员的进步，这将对我们的工作有很大的帮助。
    最后请批评指正，并祝
    大会胜利成功！各位委员身体健康！
