    Shocking News and Welcome News
    Zhu Guang
    Shocking news: flames of war rise on the plateau, the Potala Palace changes to a rebel flag,
    Disguised in robes, they initiate killing, abducting the Dalai Lama and fleeing across the border.
    Shocking news: the Dalai Lama makes a statement, independence lies betraying his past conduct.
    Knowing it's dictated by demons, how can we forget Reting and his previous life!

    Welcome news: the Tibetan people avenge their grievances, millions of soldiers and civilians plan together.
    A small group of demons are infinitely evil, how can the thousand-year-old slave system be allowed to remain!
    Welcome news: annihilating the enemy in the Southern Mountains, vowing not to return until the demons are destroyed.
    Black bones should now become white bones, Mount Everest has already smiled.

    Note: (1) In 1947, due to the collusion between the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet and imperialism, Reting Hutuktu, the former Tibetan king who was patriotic and anti-imperialist, opposed them. Suokang Wangqing Gele and Lhalu and others even led troops to capture Reting Hutuktu, torturing him to death with cruel punishments.
    (2) Black bones refer to slaves, white bones refer to free laborers.

    惊闻又喜闻
    朱光
    惊闻烽火起高原，布达拉宫换逆幡，
    假着袈裟开杀戒，劫持达赖越关门。
    惊闻达赖有声明，独立谎言背素行。
    知是捉刀凭鬼蜮，岂忘热振与前生！
    喜闻藏族报雠仇，百万军民共运筹。
    小撮妖魔无限恶，千年奴制岂能留！
    喜闻歼敌在南山，不灭群魔誓不还。
    黑骨今应成白骨，珠穆朗玛已开颜。
    注：（一）一九四七年由于西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义，遭到反帝爱国的原藏王热振活佛反对，索康·旺清格勒和拉鲁等人，竟带兵捉住热振活佛，用残酷的刑罚将他活活害死。
    （二）黑骨头即是奴隶，白骨头即是自由劳动者。
