Small Stories of the Tibetan People's Anti-Imperialist Struggle
Tibetan Nationality　Deng Zhen
    "The waves of the Nyang River roll on,
    But cannot wash away the hatred in the hearts of the people of Gyantse!
    Oh, the waters of the Yarlung Tsangpo River,
    Cannot wash away the grievances in the hearts of the Tibetan people!"
    This is a folk song circulating in the Tibetan region about the Tibetan people's opposition to British imperialism.
    In 1904, the British imperialist army invaded China's sacred territory – Tibet. At that time, thousands of Tibetan people joined the anti-British army, rushed to the front lines, and used backward weapons such as matchlock guns, poison arrows, and spears to wage brave and tenacious battles, giving the invaders a head-on blow. At this time, those who stayed at home to work, although they did not go to the front lines to fight, were not idle either. They made use of their familiarity with the terrain and their excellent marksmanship, and mysteriously and unpredictably shot at the enemy's scattered soldiers, scaring the foreign devils so much that they did not dare to leave the team a single step, and did not dare to act alone.
    At night, it was our good opportunity. Once, several herders wore their sheepskin robes inside out, put fleece hats on their heads, and mixed in with the flock of sheep to move around near the enemy's camp. The sentry foreign devils were very happy to see the sheep coming, and quickly ran to catch them. When they ran up to them, the real sheep were frightened and scattered, but the fake sheep were quite obedient. In the darkness, it was impossible to tell the real from the fake. When the enemy pounced, thinking they could have a big mutton meal, they were stabbed as soon as they got close, and died instantly, going to the eighteenth level of hell.
    Another time: Just as it was getting dark, two herders, carrying long waist knives for self-defense, sneaked into the enemy's camp without anyone noticing, and ambushed in the dark, killing two of the enemy's sentries. The two men stripped off the devils' uniforms and put them on, swaggering to the door of a large tent, pretending to stand guard there. After a while, a foreign devil soldier came out to relieve himself, humming a ditty with a smug look on his face. As soon as he stepped out of the door, he was hacked to death by the two herders. The people in the tent saw that the foreign devil was not coming back, so they sent two people out to check, but they were also stabbed to death. This time, the people inside heard the noise outside and started to make a fuss, some trembling with fear, desperately burrowing into their quilts, and some running around. The two herders took the opportunity to rush in, waving their long knives, chopping, chopping, chopping… and killing seven or eight foreign devil soldiers in one breath. The remaining foreign devil soldiers, seeing that the two who had entered were their own people, started hacking and killing indiscriminately without distinguishing between right and wrong. At this time, the two herders grabbed the foreign devils' foreign guns and knocked down several more enemies. At this time, the foreign devil soldiers living in other tents heard the gunshots and started shooting at each other. By the time they figured out the truth, the two herders had already escaped without a trace.
    Later, after the British invading army occupied Lhasa, they burned, killed, looted, and committed all kinds of evil, arousing the Tibetan people's boundless hatred. The struggle against the invading army continued unabated. One day, a lama hid a sharp dagger in his sleeve and quietly sneaked into the place where the invading army officers lived, intending to assassinate their leader. Unfortunately, he only assassinated one officer before being captured. The enemy used all kinds of torture to make him confess his accomplices, but he ignored them completely, only cursing the invaders and denouncing their crimes. The enemy had no choice but to hand him over to their running dogs – the then pro-imperialist Tibetan reactionaries – to interrogate him. When this patriotic lama stood in the court, he loudly rebuked those imperialist agents, saying: "You are running dogs, betraying the nation, betraying the motherland, what face do you have to see people?! What qualifications do you have to interrogate me?!" As a result, the interrogators became the interrogated.

    西藏人民反帝斗争小故事
    藏族　登真
    “年楚河的波浪滚滚，
    洗不尽江孜人民的心头恨！
    雅鲁藏布江的江水哟，
    洗不尽西藏人民满肚子的仇！”
    这是西藏地区流传着的藏族人民反对英帝国主义的一首民歌。
    1904年，英帝国主义军队侵入了我国神圣领土——西藏。当时，成千上万的西藏人民都纷纷参加了抗英的军队，奔赴前线，用明火枪、毒箭和梭镖等落后的武器，进行着英勇顽强的战斗，给侵略者以迎头痛击。这时候，留在家里干活的人，虽然没上火线打仗，可是也没闲着。他们利用熟悉的地形，百发百中的枪法，神出鬼没地射击敌人的散兵，吓得鬼子兵不敢离队一步，不敢单独行动。
    晚上，更是咱们的好机会。一次，有几个牧民把羊皮袄反穿在身上，头上也戴上翻毛的帽子，混在羊群里，到敌人军营的附近去活动。站岗的鬼子兵见来了羊群，非常高兴，赶快跑来捉羊。等他们跑到跟前时，真羊吓得四散奔跑，假羊可挺老实，黑糊影里，又看不清真假，敌人一扑上来，满以为可以大大吃一顿羊肉，那知才到跟前，就挨了刀子，一命呜呼，到十八层地狱去了。
    又一次：天刚擦黑的时候，有两个牧民，带着护身的长腰刀，神不知鬼不觉地摸进了敌人的宿营地，伏在暗处，把敌人的两个哨兵干掉了。两个人把鬼子的军装扒下来换上，大摇大摆的走到一个大帐篷的门口，装着站岗的样子守在那里。一会，一个鬼子兵洋洋得意地哼着小调出来解手，刚迈出门口，就让这两个牧民砍死了。帐篷里的人见那个鬼子老不回来，就让两个人出来查看，哪知又被捅死了。这下里面的人听见外面有响动，就乱哄哄地闹了起来，有的吓得直打哆嗦，拼命往被窝里钻。有的东跑西窜。两个牧民便乘机冲了进去，舞动起长刀，喳，喳，喳……地一口气砍倒了七八个鬼子兵。其余的鬼子兵，见进来的两个是自己人，就不分青红皂白，乱砍乱杀了起来。这时两个牧民又顺手抓起鬼子兵的洋枪，又撩倒了好几个敌人。这时住在别的帐篷的鬼子兵，听见枪响，都自相射击起来，等他们弄清了真相时，两个牧民早已逃得无影无踪了。
    后来，英帝侵略军进占拉萨后，到处烧杀掳掠，无恶不作，引起了藏族人民无比的仇恨，反对侵略军的斗争，更是一日不停。一天，一个喇嘛在袖中藏了一把锋利的匕首，悄悄地溜进了侵略军的军官住的地方，想刺死他们的头子，可惜他只刺杀了一个军官，就不幸被俘。敌人用尽各种酷刑，叫他供出同谋的人来，他却毫不理睬，只是破口大骂侵略者，痛斥他们的罪行。敌人无法，就交给他们的走狗——当时亲帝的西藏反动分子，替他们审问。当这位爱国喇嘛站到法庭上的时候，他大声呵斥那些帝国主义的代理人说：“你们是走狗，出卖民族，背叛祖国，有什么脸见人？！有什么资格审问我？！”结果使审问的人，反成了被审者了。
