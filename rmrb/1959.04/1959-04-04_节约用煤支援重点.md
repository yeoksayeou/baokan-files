    Using Coal Briquettes to Operate Gas Generators
    Jiangyin, Taizhou, Jintan, and other counties in Jiangsu Province have successfully tested the use of machine-made coal briquettes to operate gas generators. According to the experience of these counties, using machine-made coal briquettes to replace lump coal for powering machines is feasible if the ash removal time is well-managed to prevent ash from clumping, and the amount of ash removed each time is not too large, and the combustion layer is not too high; in this way, they can replace white coal lumps for running machines.
    Using coal briquettes to operate gas generators not only saves white coal lumps but also reduces the lump coal crushing process, and also lowers fuel costs.

    Helping Communes Build Coal-Saving Stoves
    In order to save coal and help communes run their canteens well, the Anyang City Coal Construction Company in Henan Province has vigorously promoted coal-saving stoves, which have been warmly welcomed by commune members.
    They promote two types of stoves: one is the "Vertical Fire Steaming Pot Stove." It is modified from the original stove that burned anthracite coal by widening the grate bars, enlarging the lower part of the stove body, and making the neck small, resembling a pot-bellied wine jug. This type of stove has a simple structure, saves coal, and cooks food quickly. For example, after the Shangyou Canteen on Xianqian Street switched to the "Vertical Fire Steaming Pot Stove," it only took 20 minutes to boil a pot of water and 40 minutes to steam 80 jin of mantou, with an average coal consumption of 6 liang per person per day. The other type is the T-shaped coal hole "Airplane Stove." Its upper part is the same as the "Vertical Fire Steaming Pot Stove," and the lower part has air inlets on both sides of the ash leakage hole that insert into the furnace chamber, with the air flowing in from both sides intersecting and rushing upwards. This type of stove saves coal, saves firewood, saves electricity (no need for a blower), and cooks food quickly. For example, the Jingnanying Canteen, which feeds more than 520 people, can cook porridge in just over an hour after switching to the "Airplane Stove," with a coal consumption of less than 6 liang per person per day.
    Not Afraid of Poor Coal Quality
    Is it necessary to extend the firing time when using small-kiln coal, which is of poor quality and weak firepower, to fire ceramics? The workers of the Fourth Workshop of the Xigangyao Ceramics Factory in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, answered this question with facts. Aiming at the characteristics of low coal quality of small-kiln coal, they improved technical measures and used small-kiln coal to fire kilns, reducing the firing time from 59 hours when using high-quality coal to 29 hours. The coal consumption per kiln was reduced from 9 tons of high-quality coal to 7.5 tons, and the first-class rate of ceramic pipes increased from 70% to 79%. (Photo attached)

    ——No, this is a comrade from the Coal Construction Company, here to help our canteen modify the stove. Sun Xijiang

    节约用煤支援重点
    用煤球开煤气机
    江苏省江阴、泰州、金坛等县，试用机制煤球开动煤气机成功。根据这几个县的经验，使用机制煤球代替块煤发动机器，只要掌握好出灰时间，防止煤灰结块，每次出灰不太多，燃烧层不过高；就能代替白煤块开机器。
    使用煤球开煤气机，不仅可以节省白煤块，而且能减少块煤敲碎工序，还可以降低燃料费用。

    帮助公社建省煤灶
    河南省安阳市煤建公司为了节省烧煤和帮助公社办好食堂，大力推广省煤炉灶，受到公社社员的热烈欢迎。
    他们推广的炉灶有两种：一种是“立火蒸锅灶”。它是在原来烧无烟煤的炉灶上改制的，把炉条加宽，炉下身放大，脖子小，呈瓮肚酒壶状。这种灶构造简单，用煤省，做饭快。如县前街上游食堂改用“立火蒸锅灶”后，烧开一锅水只用二十分钟，蒸八十斤面的馒头只用四十分钟，每人每天平均用煤六两。另一种是丁字形煤洞的“飞机灶”。它的上部和“立火蒸锅灶”相同，下面在漏灰洞两侧有进风口插入膛内，两侧流入的空气交叉上冲。这种灶省煤、省柴、省电（不用吹风），做饭快。如京南营食堂有五百二十多人吃饭，每顿稀饭改用“飞机灶”后一个多小时就能烧好，每人每天用煤不到六两。
    不怕煤质次
    小窑煤，煤质次，火力弱，用来烧陶瓷，烧成的时间一定要延长吗？河北省唐山市西缸窑陶磁厂第四车间的职工用事实回答了这个问题。他们针对小窑煤煤质低的特点，改进技术措施，用小窑煤烧窑，烧成时间由用优质煤的五十九小时缩短到二十九小时，每窑煤耗由用优质煤九吨降低到七点五吨，陶管甲级率由70％提高到79％。（附图片）
    ——大婶，这是你找来的泥水匠吗？
    ——不，这是煤建公司的
    同志，帮助我们食堂修
    改炉灶来了。　孙西江
