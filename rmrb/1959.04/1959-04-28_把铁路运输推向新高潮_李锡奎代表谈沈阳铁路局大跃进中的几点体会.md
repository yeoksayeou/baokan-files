Comrades of the Presidium, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. These reports are inspiring, a summary of the Great Leap Forward, and accurately reflect the unprecedented great achievements made by the people of the country under the leadership of the Party in the great year of 1958. These reports have given us great encouragement and enormous strength.

1958 was a year of overall Great Leap Forward in our country, and also a year of unprecedented leap-forward development in railway transportation. Like the rest of the country, the Shenyang Railway Bureau, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and on the basis of the victory of the great rectification movement, its employees liberated their minds, broke superstitions, unleashed soaring revolutionary energy, and launched a surging transportation upsurge. Especially after the Party Central Committee put forward the great call of taking steel as the key link and leaping forward in all aspects, all employees of the bureau, under the correct leadership of the Central Government, the Provincial Party Committee, and the Ministry of Railways, fought heroically to achieve the magnificent plan of 10.07 million tons of steel, pushing the railway transportation upsurge to a higher stage and achieving a great victory.

In 1958, the Shenyang Railway Bureau achieved great results. The volume of freight dispatched was 59,170,000 tons, accounting for 107.8 percent of the state plan, an increase of 33.8 percent compared with 1957. The freight car turnaround time was 1.64 days, accounting for 100.6 percent of the state plan, shortening by 0.1 days compared with 1957. Throughout the year, under the conditions of saving 20,336 cars, 47,325 more carloads of goods were transported, basically ensuring the needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

In 1958, we not only achieved great success in railway transportation, but also, through this year's practice, we initially explored some management experiences and found a path for high-speed development of railway transportation. Today, I will only talk about my experiences in the Great Leap Forward regarding the whole Party and the entire people running railways, strengthening communist cooperation between industrial and mining enterprises, and engaging in large-scale technological revolution.

All-Party, All-People Railway Operation Displays Great Power

(1) The policy of the whole Party and the entire people running railways is absolutely correct. The whole Party and the entire people vigorously developing iron and steel has led to a high-speed development upsurge in our country's industry, which has brought heavy transportation tasks to the railways. As a result, there were insufficient locomotives and rolling stock, some lines and hubs could not handle the traffic, local transportation capacity was insufficient, freight yards were tight, and goods piled up like mountains at the stations. Under this situation, only by earnestly implementing the policy of the whole Party and the entire people running railways can we adapt to the requirements of the Great Leap Forward situation. Under the guidance of the policy of the whole Party and the entire people running railways, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China further strengthened its leadership over railway work, and issued several decisions to strengthen railway transportation. The Provincial Party Secretary and the Governor personally took charge, grasping transportation as they grasped steel. The secretaries and mayors of each city personally went to the front line, mobilizing and organizing an army of more than 200,000 loaders and unloaders, mobilizing all available transportation tools, disregarding wind and snow, fearing no severe cold, working tirelessly, day and night, using the method of ants moving Mount Tai, rushing to load and unload, and launching a massive loading and unloading upsurge. In a very short period of time, a total of more than 900,000 tons of goods accumulated at the stations were moved out, greatly improving transportation efficiency and rapidly reversing the situation of not being able to load, unload, or move the goods away. In addition, by the end of March, the loading, unloading and transport work of 96 out of the 103 small and medium-sized stations in the bureau had been entirely undertaken by the local people's communes. Adopting this method not only strongly supported railway transportation, but also increased the income of the people's communes. The whole Party and the entire people running railways not only achieved great results in production, but also achieved great results in capital construction. In order to enable railway transportation to meet the needs of the continuous high-speed development of the entire national economy, our bureau is carrying out a large amount of railway construction. The most serious difficulty in construction is the lack of labor. In order to solve the problem of insufficient labor and speed up construction, the Shenyang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army mobilized a large number of troops to support railway construction projects, undertaking the earthwork of the Tie (ling) - Fa (ku) railway project and the Yu Guo mechanized hump project. The Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized the people of the whole city and various factories and mining enterprises to launch a mass movement of contributing labor, materials, and technology, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient materials, labor, and technical force in the expansion project of the Dalian hub. These facts fully demonstrate the enormous power of the whole Party and the entire people running railways.

Large-Scale Cooperation Between Railway Departments and Enterprise Departments Accelerates Vehicle Turnaround

(2) Strengthening communist cooperation between railway departments and enterprise departments is of great significance for tapping transportation potential, accelerating vehicle turnaround, completing transportation tasks, and thus ensuring the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. To this end, we criticized departmentalism in the rectification movement and established a communist style of serving others and being selfless. We learned from and promoted the experience of road-mine cooperation in Fuxin and Luotuo Camp, reformed the old regulations that restricted each other, and promoted the spirit of collectivism. Our bureau and Angang, Bengang, implemented the "ten unifications" and "twelve unifications" methods of unified planning, unified indicators, unified dispatch, unified shifts, unified use of equipment, unified production, transportation and sales, and unified inspection and summary, so that railway transportation and factory and mine production were closely integrated, greatly accelerating the turnaround of locomotives and vehicles.

Under the guidance of the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," road-mine cooperation has achieved new development. In its decision issued in January this year, the Provincial Party Committee stipulated the standards for vehicle dwell time at the track-connected stations of the four major factories and mines of Angang, Bengang, Dalian, and Daguantun. The secretaries or mayors of each city personally took charge of this work, and the party secretaries and factory directors of factories and mines personally went to the front line, grasping production with one hand and transportation with the other, thus greatly reducing the ore dwell time of vehicles. For example, the Benxi Municipal Party Committee grasped railway transportation tightly and meticulously. The Municipal Party Secretary often went deep into the track-connected stations of factories and mines to inspect and guide the work, and helped solve some specific problems in cooperation, further strengthening the relationship of road-mine cooperation. The factory mines load the cars on the connecting lines according to the railway marshalling plan, and directly deliver the "Red Flag Train" from the factory, which shortens the time for vehicle collection; the station directly receives the trainload of ore into the mine with railway locomotives, which eliminates the waiting time for departure. The Provincial Party Committee stipulated this year that the vehicle dwell time in Benxi is nine hours, and the first quarter completed 8.5 hours, which is 13.8 hours shorter than the same period in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, which is equivalent to saving the state 36,319 vehicles. Other factory and mine connecting stations have also made great progress. In road-mine cooperation, we deeply realize that transportation serves production, and grasping production must also grasp transportation. The result of grasping transportation brings great benefits to production. Practice has proved that "cooperation is strength," which is an eternal truth.

Engaging in Large-Scale Technological Innovation Solves Problems Immediately

(3) Mobilizing the masses, liberating the mind, breaking superstitions, and engaging in large-scale technological revolution and technological innovation not only enriches the content of carrying out mass movements on a large scale, but also is a source of tapping transportation potential and improving transportation efficiency. Our technological revolution and technological innovation are closely centered on transportation production. The masses of employees have put forward more than 200,000 suggestions for technological revolution and technological innovation, many of which are local methods and combinations of local and foreign methods that do not cost much money, are easy to build, and have great effects. And 43 of them are major inventions and creations. This fully demonstrates the infinite wisdom of the masses. In 1958, we built 12 local humps, 8 inclined pull-out lines, 8 crossover lines, laid and extended 59 railway lines with a length of 147,403 meters, built and expanded 29 freight platforms, expanded 24 freight yards, and transformed 85 turnouts and signal interlocks, and carried out locomotive modifications; the technical revolution of labor organization and operation process widely adopted mechanized and semi-mechanized tools for road maintenance, construction, loading and unloading operations. Therefore, the intensity of physical labor was reduced, the passing capacity and operation capacity of sections and stations were improved, the traction capacity of locomotives and the speed of trains were improved, and transportation efficiency was improved. For example, the construction of humps and the widespread use of iron shoe braking alone increased the efficiency of shunting operations by 30 to 50 percent, and reduced the number of braking personnel by one-third to one-half. In order to further improve transportation capacity, the construction of high platforms, low freight positions, and line relocation has begun this year. Up to now, 60 high platforms, 74 low freight positions, and 28 railway relocations have been completed. Preliminary application can improve loading and unloading efficiency by 1.6 times. This is a creation that does not cost much money and has great effects. In the large-scale technological revolution, the policy of walking on two legs, combining local and foreign methods, was implemented, and the method of starting from scratch, spending less money and doing more things, and doing things without spending money was advocated, so many problems were solved immediately. Facts have proved that without implementing the policy of walking on two legs, without mobilizing the masses to tap potential in a big way, and without engaging in large-scale technological revolution and technological innovation, it is impossible to achieve great success on the transportation front.

Overcome All Difficulties to Ensure the Completion of This Year's Transportation Task

1959 is a year of decisive importance in our country's three years of hard work. The 1959 national economic plan to be adopted at this conference is a magnificent plan. In terms of the transportation plan of the railway department, it is also the same. This year, the state stipulated that the freight volume of the Shenyang Railway Bureau will increase by 43.1 percent compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. In order to ensure the successful completion of this plan, our railway department must ensure the completion of its own transportation tasks. The main contradiction at present is that there is more freight and fewer vehicles, and the speed of capacity increase is lower than the speed of freight increase. Under this situation, completing this year's heavy transportation tasks and ensuring the realization of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton is undoubtedly very difficult. But we have the confidence to overcome all the difficulties facing us and ensure the completion of the task. Because we realize that the Great Leap Forward in 1958 has brought us a very favorable situation. Objectively speaking, the conditions are better than last year, and in terms of management experience, it is richer than in the past. Therefore, in addition to increasing some necessary technical equipment this year, as long as we muster greater efforts, give full play to the subjective initiative of people, engage in mass movements centered on technological revolution and technological innovation, strengthen transportation organization work, and further strengthen the communist large-scale cooperation between railways and factories and mining enterprises, the task can definitely be completed.

Finally, I must bring the spirit of the conference back, carry out extensive publicity and implementation, in order to further inspire the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses and do everything possible to complete and overfulfill the leap forward plan for 1959.

    把铁路运输推向新高潮
    李锡奎代表谈沈阳铁路局大跃进中的几点体会主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。这些报告是振奋人心的报告，是大跃进的总结，正确地反映了全国人民在党的领导下，在伟大的1958年所取得的空前伟大的成就。这些报告给了我们极大的鼓舞和巨大的力量。
    一九五八年是我国全面大跃进的一年，也是铁路运输事业空前飞跃发展的一年。沈阳铁路局和全国一样，在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在伟大的整风运动胜利的基础上，职工群众解放了思想，破除了迷信，发挥了冲天的革命干劲，掀起了汹涌澎湃的运输高潮。特别是在党中央提出以钢为纲、全面跃进的伟大号召后，全局职工在中央、省委和铁道部的正确领导下，为实现一千零七十万吨钢的宏伟计划英勇奋战，把铁路运输高潮推到了一个更高的阶段，取得了巨大的胜利。
    一九五八年沈阳铁路局取得的成绩是巨大的。货运发运量完成五千九百一十七万吨，为国家计划的百分之一百零七点八，比一九五七年增加百分之三十三点八，货车周转时间完成一点六四天，为国家计划的百分之一百点六，比一九五七年缩短零点一天。全年在节省二万零三百三十六辆车的条件下，多装运了四万七千三百二十五车货物，基本上保证了工农业生产大跃进的需要。
    在一九五八年中，我们不仅在铁路运输工作中取得了巨大的成就，同时，经过这一年的实践，使我们初步地摸索到了一些管理经验，找到了高速度发展铁路运输的道路。今天我只讲一讲在大跃进中，我对全党全民办铁路，加强工矿企业之间的共产主义协作和大闹技术革命的几点体会。
    全党全民办铁路发挥巨大威力
    （一）全党全民办铁路的方针是十分正确的。全党全民大办钢铁，出现了我国工业高速度发展的高潮，这就给铁路带来了繁重的运输任务。于是就出现了机车车辆不够用，有些线路和枢纽通不过，地方运输能力不足，货位紧张，车站上的货物堆积如山的情况。在这种形势下，只有认真贯彻全党全民办铁路的方针，才能适应大跃进形势的要求。在全党全民办铁路的方针指导下，中共辽宁省委进一步加强了对铁路工作的领导，曾几次发布加强铁路运输的决定，省委书记和省长亲自挂帅，像抓钢铁一样地抓运输。各市委书记、市长都亲临火线，动员与组织了二十多万人的装卸大军，动员了一切可以调用的运输工具，不顾风里雪里，不怕严寒，不辞劳苦，日夜奋战，用蚂蚁搬泰山的方法，抢装突卸，掀起了声势浩大的装卸高潮。在很短的时间内，共搬出去九十多万吨积压在车站上的货物，大大地提高了运输效率，迅速地扭转了装不上，卸不下，搬又搬不走的局面。此外，到三月末为止，在全局的一百零三个中小车站中，已经有九十六个车站的装卸、 运搬工作是全部由当地的人民公社来承担的。采取这种办法，既有力的支援了铁路运输，又增加了人民公社的收入。全党全民办铁路，不仅在生产上取得了很大成绩，而且在基本建设上也同样地取得了很大的成绩。为了使铁路运输能够适应整个国民经济不断地高速度地发展的需要，我局正在进行大量的铁路建设。在施工中，最严重的困难是劳动力不足。为了解决劳动力不足，加快建设速度，中国人民解放军沈阳军区调集了大量的军队，支援铁路建设工程，承担了铁（岭）——法（库）铁路工程和裕国机械化驼峰工程的土方工程。中共旅大市委动员了全市人民和各厂矿企业展开了献工、献料、献技术的群众运动，克服了旅大枢纽的扩建工程的材料、劳力和技术力量不足的困难。这些事实，充分证明了全党全民办铁路的巨大威力。
    铁路部门和企业部门大协作加速车辆周转
    （二）加强铁路部门与企业部门之间的共产主义协作，对于挖掘运输潜力，加速车辆周转，完成运输任务，从而保证工农业生产大跃进，有着重大的意义。为此，我们在整风运动中批判了本位主义思想，树立了我为人人克己奉公的共产主义风格。学习和推广了阜新和骆驼营路矿协作的经验，改革了互相牵扯的陈规旧律，发扬了集体主义精神。我局与鞍钢、本钢实行统一计划，统一指标、统一调度、统一班次、统一使用设备、统一产运销、统一检查总结的“十统”和“十二统”的办法，使铁路运输和厂矿生产密切地结合起来，大大加速了机车车辆周转。
    在“全国一盘棋”的方针指导下，路矿协作又有了新的发展。省委在今年一月发出的决定中，规定了鞍钢、本钢、大连、大官屯四大厂矿联轨站的车辆停留时间的标准。各市委书记或市长都亲自挂帅抓此项工作，厂矿党委书记、厂矿长都亲自上火线，一手抓生产，一手抓运输，因此，大大地压缩了车辆的矿停时间。如本溪市委对铁路运输抓的紧、抓的细，市委书记经常深入到厂矿联轨站检查和指导工作，帮助解决协作上的一些具体问题，进一步加强了路矿协作关系。厂矿按铁路编组计划的挂线装车，由厂内直接交出“红旗列车”，这就缩短了车辆集结的时间；车站将整列到达的矿石用铁路机车直接接到矿内，这就消灭了待发时间。省委今年规定本溪车辆停留时间是九小时，第一季度完成八点五小时，比跃进的一九五八年同期还缩短了十三点八小时，等于给国家节省了三万六千三百一十九辆车。其他厂矿联轨站的进步也是很大的。在路矿协作中我们深深体会到：运输为生产服务，抓生产又必须抓运输，抓运输的结果给生产又带来很大的好处。实践证明“协作就是力量”，这是一条永不颠扑的真理。
    大闹技术革新解决问题立竿见影
    （三）发动群众、解放思想、破除迷信、大闹技术革命和技术革新，不仅丰富了大搞群众运动的内容，同时也是挖掘运输潜力提高运输效率的源泉。我们的技术革命与技术革新，是紧紧围绕着运输生产这中心进行的。职工群众提出的技术革命和技术革新建议达二十多万件，其中很多是花钱不多、建设容易、效果很大的土办法和土洋结合的办法。并有四十三件是重大的发明创造。这充分显示了群众的无穷智慧。我们在一九五八年共建设了十二座土驼峰，八条坡道牵出线，八处渡线，铺设和延长了五十九股线路长达十四万七千四百零三公尺，新建和扩建货物站台二十九个，扩大货物场二十四处，改造道岔和信号联锁八十五处，并进行了机车加装改造；劳动组织作业过程的技术革命，对养路、施工、装卸作业等广泛采用了机械化、半机械化工具。因而减轻了体力劳动的强度，提高了区间和车站的通过能力和作业能力，提高了机车牵引能力和列车速度，提高了运输效率。例如仅由于驼峰的修建和铁鞋制动的广泛采用，就使调车作业提高效率百分之三十至五十，使制动人员减少三分之一到二分之一。为了进一步提高运输能力，今年又开始兴建高站台、低货位和线路搬家。到目前为止，已建成的高站台六十座，低货位七十四处，线路搬家二十八股。经初步运用就能提高装卸效率一点六倍。这是一项花钱不多、效果很大的创举。在大闹技术革命中贯彻了土洋结合两条腿走路的方针，提倡少花钱多办事、不花钱也办事的白手起家的方法，因而立竿见影地解决了很多问题。事实证明不实行两条腿走路的方针，不发动群众大挖潜力，不大闹技术革命和技术革新，是不可能在运输战线上取得巨大成绩的。
    克服一切困难保证完成今年运输
  任务一九五九年是我国苦战三年具有决定性的一年，我们这次会议将要通过的一九五九年国民经济计划是一个宏伟的计划。从铁路部门的运输计划来说，也是如此。今年国家规定沈阳铁路局的货物发送量，比大跃进的一九五八年又增长了百分之四十三点一。为了保证这个计划的胜利完成，我们铁路部门必须保证完成自己的运输任务，而当前的主要矛盾是货多车少，能力增长的速度低于货运增长的速度。在这种情况下，完成今年繁重的运输任务，保证钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标的实现，无疑是非常艰巨的。但是我们有信心克服摆在我们面前的一切困难，保证完成任务。因为我们认识到，一九五八年的大跃进，给我们带来了非常有利的形势，从客观条件来说，比去年更好，从管理经验来说，比过去更为丰富，因此，在今年除了增加一点必要的技术设备以外，只要我们鼓足更大的干劲，充分发挥人的主观能动性，大搞以技术革命和技术革新为中心的群众运动，加强运输组织工作，进一步加强铁路与厂矿企业之间的共产主义大协作，任务是一定能够完成的。
    最后，我一定要把大会精神带回去，进行广泛的宣传和贯彻执行，以进一步鼓舞广大群众的革命干劲，千方百计地为完成和超额完成一九五九年的跃进计划而努力。
