Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 8th. Panchen Erdeni conducted activities of worshipping Buddha and chanting sutras yesterday at the Jokhang Temple and Ramoche Temple in Lhasa. Accompanying Panchen Erdeni on the visit for worshipping Buddha and chanting sutras were Dingjie Living Buddha, Deputy Director of the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Jayan Living Buddha, Panchen Erdeni's scripture teacher.

The Jokhang Temple is one of the ancient temples in Tibet, housing a golden statue of Sakyamuni Buddha brought to Tibet from Xi'an by Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty. Panchen Erdeni presented a Hada and "Mandala" before this Buddha statue, and recited scriptures of blessing.

Panchen Erdeni spent more than two hours worshipping Buddha and chanting sutras in the Jokhang Temple. Before leaving, he spoke to the lamas in the temple. He said that the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government have always respected the religious freedom of the Tibetan people, and it is still the same today as it was before. He admonished the monks not to lightly believe the rumors of the rebel elements, to conscientiously abide by the various policies and decrees of the Central Government, and under the leadership of the Party, to forever be loyal to the Motherland and loyal to the people.

When Panchen Erdeni was worshipping Buddha inside the Jokhang Temple, hundreds of monks, nuns, and lay people gathered at the entrance of the Jokhang Temple to welcome him. When Panchen Erdeni finished worshipping Buddha and came out, many people rushed to the side of the car, requesting him to touch their heads. Panchen Erdeni touched the heads of the people who came forward under the tender green ancient Tang willow tree, giving blessings.

Subsequently, Panchen Erdeni took a car via Barkhor Street to the Ramoche Temple to worship Buddha. Along the way, thousands of Lhasa citizens gathered on both sides of the street, burning incense and bowing in reverence, warmly welcoming him.

    班禅额尔德尼到大昭寺小昭寺朝佛诵经
    告诫僧众永远忠于祖国和人民
    新华社拉萨8日电　班禅额尔德尼昨天在拉萨市内的大昭寺和小昭寺进行了朝佛和诵经活动。陪同班禅额尔德尼前往朝佛诵经的有西藏自治区筹备委员会宗教事务委员会副主任丁杰活佛和班禅额尔德尼的经师嘉漾活佛。
    大昭寺是西藏的古老寺庙之一，寺内供有唐代文成公主从西安带入西藏的释迦牟尼佛金像。班禅额尔德尼在这尊佛像前献了哈达和“曼扎”，并诵念了祝愿的经文。
    班禅额尔德尼在大昭寺朝佛诵经历时两个多小时。临走时，他向寺内的喇嘛们讲了话。他说，中国共产党、中央人民政府一贯尊重西藏人民宗教信仰自由，今天还是和从前一样。他告诫僧众们不要轻信叛乱分子的谣言，要好好地遵守中央的各项政策法令，在党的领导下，永远忠于祖国，忠于人民。
    当班禅额尔德尼在大昭寺内朝佛的时候，大昭寺门口聚集了成百上千的僧俗人民欢迎他。班禅额尔德尼朝佛完毕出来，许多人涌向汽车旁，要求他摸顶。班禅额尔德尼在嫩绿的古唐柳下为前来的人们摸顶祝福。
    随后，班禅额尔德尼乘车经八角街前往小昭寺朝佛。一路上，有几千拉萨市民聚集街道两旁焚香顶礼，热烈欢迎他。
