(Reported from Chengdu, April 8) Xindu County, Sichuan Province, is vigorously strengthening the late-stage management of oilseed rape, launching a “Full Tip” campaign to strive for large-scale high yields.

Xindu County is one of the ten counties that recently initiated a national oilseed rape high-yield competition. Currently, the oilseed rape here has entered its full flowering stage. High-yield fields, accounting for about half of the total area, and first-class seedlings are all over four to five feet tall, with forty to eighty branches. The rest are also over three feet tall, with at least twenty branches.

After the Xindu County Party Committee issued the high-yield competition proposal to the country, it immediately led the people of the county to focus on late-stage management. In in-depth discussions with farmers in rural areas, the County Party Committee learned that it was common for the tops of oilseed rape plants not to form pods after flowering in previous years. This "incomplete tip" greatly affected the number of pods and seeds produced. Based on this situation, the County Party Committee conducted repeated studies and mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and strategies, focusing on how to ensure that oilseed rape achieves "full tips." Many communes also held technical symposiums with experienced farmers. Commune member Liao Menli shared his experience of achieving "full tips" one year by conducting intensive fertilization and irrigation during the flowering period of oilseed rape.

After repeated research, a “Full Tip” campaign, centered on topdressing and aggressively tackling the two “barriers” of pod formation and increased grain, was launched vigorously throughout the county. The County Party Committee proposed that the whole county should apply fertilizer at least four to five times from the flowering stage to the pod stage, focusing on the application of potash and phosphate fertilizers in addition to nitrogen fertilizer; irrigate once or twice from the flowering stage to the end of flowering, according to the specific conditions of each field; in addition, oilseed rape fields prone to disease should be disinfected and prevented with a mixture of grass ash and lime, and those that have already occurred should be treated and eliminated in time. At the same time, vigorously remove the yellow and diseased leaves of oilseed rape to avoid the breeding and spread of diseases, which is conducive to ventilation and light transmission. The masses acted immediately and launched a heated competition centered on this. More than 20,000 people were mobilized for the first topdressing of fertilizer during the flowering period, completing the task in a week. This year, due to the tall and dense oilseed rape, many new difficulties have arisen in fertilization and other management tasks, but they have been overcome by the commune members one by one. For oilseed rape fields that people cannot enter, the commune members created a seedling separator made of bamboo bent into an arc shape, which can both separate the oilseed rape and ensure that the rapeseed flowers are not touched; if manure buckets cannot be carried in, the communes created various new fertilization tools. For example, a rubber tube is installed under a wooden bucket in the form of a sprayer, and one person can carry it on their back to apply fertilizer in the field. Another example is a bamboo tube made by drilling through bamboo, which can smoothly leak dry manure to the plants that need fertilization. These efforts have ensured the smooth progress of fertilization. At present, the whole county has universally applied a flowering period fertilizer and most of the fields have been spring irrigated.

### 多施花肥争取油菜“满尖”  新都发动群众献策献计破两关

    多施花肥争取油菜“满尖”
    新都发动群众献策献计破两关
    本报成都8日电　四川省新都县大抓油菜后期管理，开展“满尖”运动，力争油菜大面积高产。
    新都县是不久前向全国发起油菜高产竞赛倡议的十个县中的一个，现在，这里的油菜已进入盛花期，占总面积一半左右的高产田和一类苗株高都在四、五尺以上，分枝四十到八十多个，其余也都高达三尺以上，分枝最少有二十多。
    中共新都县委在向全国发出高产竞赛倡议以后，立即狠狠地领导全县人民抓住后期管理。县委负责人在深入农村和农民座谈中了解到，往年油菜顶端在开花后不结荚的情况十分普遍。由于这种“不满尖”，就大大影响了油菜结荚数和菜籽粒数。根据这一情况，县委进行了反复研究，并以如何保证油菜满尖问题为中心发动群众献计献策，许多公社还举行了老农技术座谈会。社员廖门礼详细介绍了自己有一年在油菜花期中，进行大肥大水管理而取得“满尖”的经验。
    经过这样反复研究，一个以追肥为中心，大肥大水猛攻结荚、增粒两“关”的满尖运动，便在全县轰轰烈烈开展起来。县委提出，全县从花期到荚期至少要追肥四到五次，除氮肥外要着重施用钾肥和磷肥；从花期到谢花期根据每块田具体情况浸灌一次到两次；除此以外，可能发生病害的油菜田，一律用草木灰和石灰混合剂消毒预防，已发生的及时除治，同时大力摘除油菜的黄叶和病叶，避免病害滋生传染，利于通风透光。广大群众说干就干，并且以此为中心展开了热烈的竞赛。全县追第一次花肥便出动两万多人，突击了一个星期。今年由于油菜高大茂密，给施肥等管理工作带来许多新的困难，但都被社员们一一克服了。人进不去的油菜田，社员们创造了用竹子弯成弓形的分苗器，既能把油菜分开，又保证不碰伤菜花；粪桶担不进去，各公社就创造出各种各样新的施肥工具。如在喷雾器形式的木桶下面安上橡皮管，一个人背在背上就可以下田施肥，又如把竹子打通做成的竹管，可以把干粪顺利地漏到需施肥的植株。由于这些努力就保证了施肥顺利进行。目前全县油菜普遍施了一次花期肥，大部进行了春灌。
