Farmers in the wheat-producing area of southern Shanxi Province are adopting the method of "layer-by-layer contracting, block-by-block defense, preparing without frost, and decisive battle with frost," actively engaging in activities such as watering, topdressing, and preparing fuel to prevent late frost damage, ensuring that wheat safely passes the jointing stage.

Currently, more than 450,000 commune members in the region have been投入(pinyin: tóurù, meaning put in, engaged in) into various frost prevention activities. A professional wheat field management team of 330,000 people, after implementing the "four-fixed" management responsibility system of leaders contracting at each level and commune members "fixed person," "fixed land," "fixed time," and "fixed task," has achieved having soldiers in every block, everyone responsible, and no omissions. In terms of irrigation, various places have adopted the method of human and animal shifts, waterwheels non-stop, and day and night rushes, which has increased the water output and allowed 800,000 mu of wheat to be universally watered once. In order to use more phosphorus and potassium fertilizers for wheat fields, they changed the public canteens from burning charcoal to burning straw and cotton firewood, and strengthened the management of toilets and livestock pens. Fertilizer plants stepped up production, and now large quantities of plant ash and human manure have been applied to wheat fields. All 8.5 million mu of wheat fields in the region have been universally topdressed once or twice. Under the call of "putting firewood in every block, everyone preparing fuel," frost prevention platforms and frost prevention pits have been established in the fields. The 2,430 frost prevention shock teams formed by the people's communes in Jishan County, in addition to actively carrying out wheat field management work such as watering and topdressing, have also prepared more than 30 million catties of fuel. Their slogan is "Once frost comes, smoke rises everywhere."

The 8.5 million mu of wheat in the Jinan Prefecture are generally growing vigorously, and the wheat seedlings are already about one foot tall, just at the jointing stage. In mid-to-late April of previous years, the growing wheat often encountered the invasion of late frost damage. Recent drastic changes in temperature indicate that late frost may be coming. The Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the past experience in preventing wheat frost damage, and called on all farmers in the region to "everyone start, the whole people prevent frost, and overcome frost damage." Meteorological forecasting organizations that have been established in various places are establishing forecasting systems and actively imparting frost prevention technology to the masses.

    无霜备战　有霜决战
    晋南农民严阵保卫小麦
    本报太原9日电　山西省晋南产麦区的农民采取“层层包干、块块设防、无霜备战、有霜决战”的办法，积极投入了浇水、追肥和准备燃料等预防晚霜冻害的活动，保证小麦安全度过拔节关。
    目前，全区投入预防霜冻各项活动的社员已有四十五万多人。一支由三十三万人组成的麦田管理专业队伍，在推行了领导干部逐级包干，社员“定人”、“定地”、“定时间”、“定任务”的“四定”管理责任制度以后，做到了块块有兵，人人负责，点点不漏。在灌溉方面，各地采取了人畜换班、水车不停、日夜突击的办法后，提高了出水量，使八十万亩小麦普浇了一次。他们为了给麦田多使磷钾肥料，把公共食堂烧炭的改成烧秸秆和棉柴，并加强了厕所、畜圈的管理，肥料厂加紧生产，现在已把大批草木灰、人粪尿施入麦田，全区八百五十万亩麦田普施了一次到两次追肥。各地农民在“块块放柴，人人备燃”的号召下，防霜台、防霜坑已经在地头建立起来。稷山县各人民公社组成的两千四百三十个防霜突击队，除积极进行浇水、追肥等麦田管理工作外，并备足燃料三千余万斤。他们的口号是“一旦临霜，遍地冒烟”。
    晋南专区的八百五十万亩小麦，普遍生长茁壮，麦苗已高达一尺左右，正处在拔节时期。历年4月中下旬，正在成长的小麦往往遇到晚霜冻害的侵袭，最近气温的急剧变化预示晚霜可能到来。中共晋南地委总结了过去的预防小麦霜冻斗争的经验，并且号召全区农民“人人动手，全民防霜，战胜冻害”。各地已经建立起来的气象预报组织，正在建立预报制度，并向群众积极传授防霜技术。
