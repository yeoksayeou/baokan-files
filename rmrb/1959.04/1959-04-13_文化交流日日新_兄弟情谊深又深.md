　　Cultural Exchanges are Renewed Daily, Brotherly Friendship Grows Deeper
　　Ancient Poems Inspire New Friendship
    Not long ago, the melodious and moving sounds of the Moscow Radio broadcast reached listeners. A clear female voice thoughtfully sang:
    Left home young, returned old,
    Accent unchanged, but hair grown cold.
    Children see me, know me not,
    Smiling, ask from whence I'm brought.
    The melody expressed a person's deep sorrow, recalling the irretrievable years that had vanished in a foreign land.
    The announcer introduced the program as: “‘Returning to My Hometown,’ words by He Zhizhang, music by Pichugin.”
    How did the twenty-six-year-old Soviet composer Pichugin choose a Chinese poem from before the twelfth century to set to music?
    Once, Pichugin came across a "Collection of Chinese Poems." Before this, he had never read old Chinese poems. He was deeply moved by the human touch and the perfection of form in the poems. These were not lifeless works merely for display, but lyrical and beautiful poems. The blood coursing through them made them feel familiar to us in the twentieth century.
    He decided to compose a set of songs for Chinese classical poetry. He selected twelve in total, and has now completed four, forming the first part of the whole set. These include Dai Shulun's "Changing Tune," Li Yu's "Remembering Jiangnan," Li Bai's "Hearing the Flute in Luoyang on a Spring Night," and the aforementioned "Returning to My Hometown." The first two songs of the second part are Li Bai's "Sitting Alone on Jingting Mountain" and Niu Xiji's "Sheng Zha Zi," which are nearing completion. The remaining six can also be finished soon.
    Soviet experts believe that this set of songs is Pichugin's great achievement. Composer Alexandrov gave a high evaluation after listening to Pichugin's Chinese love songs.
    Pichugin is not a professional composer, at least not yet. His profession is linguistics. He is a graduate of Moscow State University and currently works as an editor for the "Bulletin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences," meaning that he is engaged in work unrelated to musical creation.
    However, since childhood, he has loved music. He taught himself to play the piano. While studying at the Department of Linguistics at the university, he studied music theory and history. Finally, he tried to compose some pieces.
    For four years, Pichugin has been studying in the amateur composer class at the Moscow Central Composers' House.
    In 1955, Pichugin composed a set of children's piano pieces "In the Zoo." This set of pieces will soon be published by the "Soviet Composer" publishing house. He has also set two love songs to Goethe's poems. (Yi)
　　The "Lu Xun Library" in Prague
    Near the ancient Charles Bridge in Prague stands the Oriental Institute, the center of Czech Sinology research, which houses the Lu Xun Library with more than 40,000 books.
    Chinese visitors to the Lu Xun Library feel especially at home because the language barrier does not exist here; almost all the staff can speak Chinese. The library was established in 1951 after the director of the Oriental Institute and renowned Czech Sinologist, Jaroslav Průšek, returned from a visit to China. It serves the Sinology research work of the Oriental Institute, as well as readers who understand Chinese and love Chinese literature. Some Chinese students studying in Czechoslovakia also frequently borrow books here. The library has two sizable stacks, one containing mostly valuable Chinese series, such as the Wanyou Wenku, Sibu Congkan, Sibu Beiyao, rare editions of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, and ancient drama series. This stack also displays many Chinese books that have been translated into Czech, such as Sun Tzu's The Art of War, Confucius' Analects, Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, Li Bai's poetry collection, and some modern literary works, including Chairman Mao's selected poems and Zhao Shuli's novels. The other stack mainly contains various Chinese historical, literary, and artistic works published after the liberation, various Chinese magazines and newspapers, including complete sets of "Short Story Magazine" and "New Youth" magazine bound volumes. The head of the library said that they cherish these magazines, which are difficult to buy again, because they record the situation of Chinese revolutionary literature at a certain period.
    In recent years, the Sinology research work of the Oriental Institute has focused on modern and contemporary Chinese history, literature, and art. In particular, the rapid development of Chinese cultural undertakings since liberation has aroused great interest among Czech Sinology researchers. Therefore, the Lu Xun Library has also added a large number of modern and contemporary Chinese books, magazines, and various materials. Currently, one-third of the Lu Xun Library's collection is modern and contemporary Chinese books.
    The researchers at this library are compiling a Czech-Chinese dictionary. They are paying attention to the prospects of Chinese character reform, so this dictionary will also include the Latin alphabet transcription of Chinese.
    The Lu Xun Library has also established close ties with the National Library of China in Beijing. The National Library of China regularly sends them various new books, and they also frequently exchange various book materials with each other.

　　"Lotus Lantern" in Novosibirsk
    The picture is a still from the final scene of our country's dance drama "Lotus Lantern." Doesn't it look as if it was taken in a theater in our country? But this is a scene from the performance by Soviet dance artists at the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater on March 9. This performance is the result of the close cooperation between Chinese and Soviet artists.
    In the autumn of the year before last, the dance troupe and orchestra of the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater in the Soviet Union made a visiting performance in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of our country. During the performance, Chinese and Soviet actors established a close friendship. Later, Soviet artists chose "Lotus Lantern"—our country's beautiful mythological song and dance drama—as their performance project; our country's artists provided assistance in many aspects. The "Lotus Lantern" dance drama then met the Soviet audience.

### 文化交流日日新　兄弟情谊深又深

　　文化交流日日新　兄弟情谊深又深
　　古诗谱出新友情
    不久以前，莫斯科广播电台的电波传来了悠扬悦耳、动人心弦的旋律。清脆的女声沉思地歌唱：
    少小离家老大回，
    乡音无改鬓毛衰。
    儿童相见不相识，
    笑问客从何处来？
    音乐的旋律表达了一个人的深切哀愁，他在回忆在异乡消逝的永不复返的岁月。
    播音员是这样报告这个节目的：“回乡偶书”，贺知章作词，皮丘京作曲。
    二十六岁的苏联作曲家皮丘京，怎样会选上十二世纪以前的中国古诗来配曲呢？
    有一次，皮丘京弄到一本“中国诗集”。在这以前，他从来没有读过中国旧诗。他深为诗中的人情味和形式的完善所感动了。这不是死气沉沉、徒供陈列的作品，而是抒情的优美的诗歌。诗中热血奔腾，我们二十世纪的人同样感到亲切。
    他决定为中国古典诗词配一组歌。他一共选了十二首，现在已经编成四首，成为全组的第一部。其中包括戴叔伦的“转应曲”，李煜的“望江南”，李白的“春夜洛城闻笛”和上面提到的“回乡偶书”。第二部前两首是李白的“独坐敬亭山”和牛希济的“生查子”，已经快编完了。其余六首也可以很快完成。
    苏联专家认为，这组套曲是皮丘京的巨大成就。作曲家亚历山大罗夫听了皮丘京的中国恋歌以后，给予很高的评价。
    皮丘京并不是职业作曲家，至少目前是这样。他的专业是语言学，是国立莫斯科大学的毕业生，现在在“苏联科学院通报”当编辑，也就是说，他从事的是同音乐创作没有关系的工作。
    但是，从童年起，他就热爱音乐。他自修学会弹钢琴。他在大学语言学系念书的时候，研究过音乐理论和历史。最后他才尝试著作一些曲子。
    四年来，皮丘京一直在莫斯科中央作曲家之家的业余作曲班学习。
    1955年，皮丘京作了一组儿童钢琴曲“在动物园里”。这组曲子很快就要由“苏联作曲家”出版社出版。他还给哥德的诗配了两首恋歌。（伊）
　　布拉格的“鲁迅图书馆”
    在布拉格古老的查理士桥畔，有一座东方学院，它是捷克斯洛伐克汉学研究的中心，附设有一个拥有四万多册图书的鲁迅图书馆。
    到鲁迅图书馆参观的中国人都会感到特别亲切，因为在这里由于语言不通所造成的困难不存在了，几乎所有的工作人员都能说中国话。这个图书馆是1951年东方学院院长、捷克斯洛伐克著名汉学家普实克访问中国回来后建立的，它为东方学院的汉学研究工作服务，同时也为一些懂得中文的爱好中国文学的读者服务，这里也经常有一些留捷的中国学生来借阅书籍。图书馆有两个不小的书库，一个书库中大部是中国珍贵的丛书，如万有文库、四部丛刊、四部备要、四库全书的珍本、古本戏剧丛刊等。在这个书库里还陈列有许多已经译成捷文的中国书，如孙子兵法、孔子论语、聊斋志异、李白的诗集，以及一些现代文学作品，其中有毛主席的诗选，赵树理的小说等。另一个书库大都是解放后出版的各种中文历史、文学和艺术著作，各种中国的杂志和报纸，其中也包括有全套的“小说月报”和“新青年”杂志的合订本。这个图书馆的负责人说，他们十分珍贵这些很难再买到的杂志，因为它们记载了中国革命文学某一个时期的情况。
    近年来，东方学院的汉学研究工作着重注意到中国近代和现代历史、文学和艺术。特别是解放以来，中国文化事业的飞跃发展引起了捷克斯洛伐克汉学研究人员的极大兴趣，因此鲁迅图书馆也大量添置近代和现代的中国书籍、杂志和各种资料，目前，鲁迅图书馆有三分之一是中国近代和现代的书籍。
    这个图书馆的研究人员正在编写一本捷华字典，他们注意到中国文字改革的前景，因此这本字典也将有汉语的拉丁化拼音。
    鲁迅图书馆还同中国国立北京图书馆建立了密切的联系，国立北京图书馆定期为他们寄去各种新书，他们也经常互相交换各种图书资料。

　　“宝莲灯”在新西伯利亚
    图片是我国舞剧“宝莲灯”最后一场的剧照，看来多么像是在我国的哪一个剧院拍照的啊！但是，这却是苏联的舞蹈艺术家3月9日在新西伯利亚歌舞剧院中演出时的一景。这次演出是中苏两国艺术家亲密合作的结晶。
    前年秋天，苏联新西伯利亚歌舞剧院舞蹈团和乐队在北京、上海和广州作了访问演出，受到我国广大观众的热烈欢迎。演出期间，中苏两国演员建立了亲密的友谊。后来，苏联艺术家选了“宝莲灯”——我国优美的神话歌舞剧，作为他们的演出项目；我国艺术家则给予了多方面的协助。“宝莲灯”舞剧于是同苏联观众见面了。
