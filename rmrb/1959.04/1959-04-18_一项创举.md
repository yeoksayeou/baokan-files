An Innovation
By a People's Daily Commentator

　　An innovation in pig farming – establishing "hundred-mu hundred-pig farms" on mountains and in bays near cultivated land – has initially blossomed and borne fruit in the Dazhai People's Commune of Qin'an County, Gansu Province.

　　Since "industry approaching raw material production areas" can "reduce the waste of labor to a minimum in the transition from raw material processing to subsequent processes, that is, to semi-finished product processing and final product manufacturing" (Lenin, "On Communist Society," p. 131), can this principle be applied in agriculture? The Dazhai People's Commune has answered this question affirmatively with practical action. They have established fertilizer bases in the cultivated land. One hundred pigs are a "factory" that produces fertilizer equivalent to 6,000 jin of ammonium sulfate annually; making these "factories" close to the "raw material production areas" and the places where the largest amounts of its "products" are "consumed" is a major saving. According to calculations in some areas, the labor used for transporting fertilizer alone in agricultural production accounts for more than one-third of the entire crop production process. If all the people's communes in the country, especially the people's communes in mountainous areas, which account for more than half of China's territory, adopt this approach of the Dazhai People's Commune and establish pig farms in cultivated land, what a tremendous effect this would have! Since pig farming can be done this way, can't other livestock and poultry be done the same way?

　　Since the relationship between crop cultivation and animal husbandry is one of mutual integration and interdependence, can a base number be found between the two for proportional and planned development? The Dazhai People's Commune has also initially discovered some patterns in this work through practical action. The so-called "hundred-mu hundred-pig farm" is to establish a pig farm in one hundred mu of cultivated land, raising about one hundred pigs. In this one hundred mu of cultivated land, 25 to 30 mu of land is used to grow feed to feed these one hundred pigs. At the same time, the manure from these one hundred pigs is applied to the remaining 70-plus mu of cultivated land. One mu of cultivated land intercropped with various feeds can yield 10,000 jin several times a year, which is enough to feed three to four pigs. Each pig accumulates 40 dan of refined fertilizer per year, which can basically meet the needs of one mu of cultivated land. In this way, a roughly closed-loop system is established between crop cultivation and animal husbandry. According to the materials of the Dazhai People's Commune, last year their partial cultivated land, due to the establishment of hundred-mu hundred-pig farms and the application of more fertilizer, increased grain production by 86%. According to this increase index, although 25 mu are extracted from 100 mu of cultivated land to grow feed, the output of the 75 mu of land used to grow grain is still 39.7% higher than the original output of 100 mu of land. It should also be noted that last year was the first time they built the farm, and the manure from 100 pigs throughout the year was not all applied to the 75 mu of crops. According to the materials of comparative experiments in some areas of the country that do not apply fertilizer and apply pig manure fertilizer, under the same other farming conditions, applying about 40 dan of pig manure per mu can produce 200 to 300 jin more grain per mu than without applying fertilizer. Based on this calculation, the increase in production figures would be even greater. From this, it can be seen that the relationship between crop cultivation and animal husbandry is not only a relationship of mutual integration and interdependence, but also a relationship of mutual promotion and mutual improvement. This cycle is not a simple cycle that repeats itself, but a spiral cycle that rises continuously. The more grain is produced, the richer the feed, the more livestock will reproduce, and the more manure will be accumulated. Under certain conditions and within certain limits, combined with other production increase measures, it can further promote the increase in grain production.

　　From here, we can also see that this will play an important role in realizing the great and beautiful ideal of landscaping the land.

　　一项创举
　　本报评论员
    养猪工作的一项创举——在接近耕地的山上和湾里建立“百亩百猪场”，已经在甘肃省秦安县大寨人民公社初开红花，喜结硕果。
    既然“工业接近原料产地”就可以“使得在从原料加工转到以后各个程序时，即转到半制品加工和最后制成成品时能把劳动力的浪费减少到最低限度”（列宁语，见“论共产主义社会”131页），那末，在农业中是不是也可以应用这个原则呢？大寨人民公社以实际的行动对这个问题作了肯定的答复。他们把肥料基地建立到耕地里去。一百头猪就是一个年产相当于六千斤硫酸铵的肥料的“工厂”；使这些“工厂”接近“原料产地”和“消费”它的最大量的“产品”的地方，这是一项最大的节约。根据有些地方的测算，农业生产中每年光运肥所用的劳动力，要占整个农作物生产过程用工的三分之一以上。如果全国的人民公社，首先是占我国版图面积一半以上的山区的人民公社，都采用大寨人民公社这种做法，把猪场建立到耕地中去，这该有多么巨大的效果！既然养猪可以如此，其他的牲畜和家禽不是也可以这样么？
    既然种植业和畜牧业的关系是互相结合和互相依存的，那末，是不是可以在两者中间找出一个按比例和有计划发展的基数呢？大寨人民公社也以实际的行动在这项工作中初步摸出了规律。所谓“百亩百猪场”，就是在一百亩耕地中建立一个猪场，饲养一百头左右的猪。在这一百亩耕地中，拿出二十五亩到三十亩的土地种植饲料，喂养这一百头猪。同时，这一百头猪的粪便施于其余的七十多亩耕地。一亩耕地套种各种饲料，一年几次，共可收一万斤，足够喂养三头到四头猪。每头猪一年积精肥四十担，基本上可以满足一亩耕地的需要。这样就在种植业和畜牧业中间，大体上建立一个循环系统。根据大寨人民公社的材料，去年他们的部分耕地由于建立了百亩百猪场，多施了肥，粮食增产了86％。按照这个增产指数，一百亩耕地虽然抽出二十五亩种植饲料，而种植粮食的七十五亩地的产量，仍然较原来一百亩地的产量净增39.7％。还应当看到，去年他们是第一次建场，一百头猪全年的粪肥并没有全部施在七十五亩庄稼地上。按照全国各地一些不施肥和施猪粪肥的对比试验的材料，其他耕作条件相同，每亩施猪粪四十担左右，比不施肥的每亩可以多产二百到三百斤粮食。依此计算，增产数字就会更多。由此可见，种植业和畜牧业的关系，不仅是互相结合和互相依存的关系，而是互相促进和互相提高的关系。这种循环不是简单地周而复始的循环，而是螺旋式的不断上升的循环。粮食增产越多，饲料越丰富，牲畜就繁殖得更多，粪肥也就积攒得更多，在一定条件下和一定限度内，配合上别的增产措施，就可以更大地促进粮食的增产。
    从这里我们还可以看到，这对于实现大地园林化的伟大美好理想也将会起重要的作用。
