　　Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme Says at Banquet:
　　Strive to Build a New Socialist Tibet
　　Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme also spoke at the banquet. He said that the representatives from the Tibet region, headed by Panchen Erdeni as Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, received a warm welcome from Premier Zhou and other central leaders and responsible individuals from all walks of life upon their arrival in Beijing this time, and received meticulous care from the central leaders. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude and high respect to the central leaders.

　　Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said that the Tibetan rebels had miscalculated. Contrary to the wishes of the rebels, their rebellion not only failed to split the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all ethnic groups, but instead promoted the consolidation of the motherland's unity, strengthened the solidarity of all ethnic groups, and promoted the new birth, prosperity, and progress of Tibet. He said, let us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strive to build a new socialist Tibet.

　　Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech that our gathering here today shows that the unity of our motherland cannot be undermined by the Tibetan rebels; nor can the advance of all ethnic groups towards socialism be stopped by the Tibetan rebels. He also said that when I went to Tibet in the past, I said in Lhasa that the great unity of all ethnic groups in our country is like "evergreen mountains and ever-flowing rivers." The fact that the Panchen Lama and comrades have come to Beijing this time to attend the National People's Congress fully proves this point.

　　At the banquet, Premier Zhou, Panchen Erdeni, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and Vice Premier Chen Yi all raised their glasses to warmly congratulate the unification and prosperity of the great motherland, to congratulate the great unity of all ethnic groups and the prosperity and progress of Tibet, and to congratulate the good health of Chairman Mao, the leader beloved by all ethnic groups. Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen Yi also suggested that everyone toast to the health of the beloved Panchen Erdeni, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and all friends! National People's Congress representatives Jamdong Gyaltsen Jigme, Sherpa Tendzin, National Committee member of the CPPCC Ngapoi Tsedan Drolkar, and the entourage of Panchen Erdeni, all attended the banquet tonight.

　　National People's Congress representatives Bangda Dorje, Gesang Wangdu, and National Committee member of the CPPCC Ngawang Jinpa, who are in Beijing, were also invited to attend the banquet.

　　Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai and Ulanhu, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, and Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairmen of the CPPCC Chen Shutong and Li Siguang, Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Standing Committee member of the National People's Congress and Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee Wang Feng, and Central Representative to Tibet Zhang Jingwu, all attended the banquet tonight as companions.

　　Also attending the banquet as companions were some of the members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee who are in Beijing, the heads of various ministries and commissions of the State Council, the Deputy Chief of General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, the Deputy Mayor of Beijing, the heads of relevant people's organizations, and Tibetan people in Beijing.

　　After the banquet, Premier Zhou accompanied Panchen Erdeni, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and others to attend a welcoming party and watched wonderful songs and dances and acrobatics of various ethnic groups.

　　阿沛·阿旺晋美在宴会上说：
　　努力建设社会主义新西藏
    阿沛·阿旺晋美也在宴会上讲了话。他说，以班禅额尔德尼代理主任委员为首的西藏地区的代表这次到达北京时，受到了周总理等中央首长和各界负责人士的热烈欢迎，受到了中央首长无微不至的关怀，我们谨向中央首长表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说，西藏的叛乱分子们打错了算盘。与叛乱分子的愿望相反，他们的叛乱不但没有分裂祖国的统一和各民族的团结，反而促进了祖国统一的巩固，促进了各民族团结的加强，促进了西藏的新生、繁荣和进步。他说，让我们在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，努力建设社会主义的新西藏。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，今天我们欢聚一堂，这说明我们祖国的统一，是西藏叛乱分子破坏不了的；各民族向社会主义的迈进，也是西藏叛乱分子阻挡不了的。他又说，我过去到西藏的时候，在拉萨曾经说过，我国各民族的伟大团结有如“青山不老，绿水长流”，这次班禅大师和各位同志来北京出席全国人民代表大会，又充分地证明了这一点。

    在北京的全国人民代表大会代表邦达多吉、格桑旺堆，政协全国委员会委员纳旺金巴，也应邀出席了宴会。
