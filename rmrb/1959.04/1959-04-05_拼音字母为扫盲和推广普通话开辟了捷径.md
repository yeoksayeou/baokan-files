Pinyin Alphabet Opens a Shortcut for Literacy and Promoting Mandarin
By our commentator

Currently, there is still a large number of illiterate young and middle-aged people in the country who need to be eliminated; among the students who have graduated from literacy classes, some need to refresh their knowledge, some need to consolidate their learning, and some who have consolidated their learning need to further improve. Continuing to eliminate illiteracy and consolidate and expand the results of literacy is a major task in current education work. Therefore, this year, we must continue to exert our energy, adopt various practical and effective methods, and use all favorable opportunities to conscientiously carry out literacy work among workers and peasants, including the consolidation and improvement work after literacy.

The experience of Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang and other provinces in phonetic literacy (using pinyin letters to annotate Chinese characters for literacy) proves that pinyin letters are indeed a powerful tool for consolidating literacy results. A major difficulty in learning Chinese characters is that the pronunciation of a character is generally not apparent from the character itself and must be taught by a teacher one by one. If students forget, the teacher must teach them again. Now, using pinyin letters to annotate Chinese characters solves a major difficulty in Chinese character teaching. As long as students learn the pinyin letters and the pinyin method, they can learn Chinese characters through annotated textbooks and readings; when they encounter unfamiliar characters, they can know how to pronounce the character by simply spelling out the letters. Many people praise pinyin letters, saying that they are a "magic weapon for recognizing characters" and a "silent teacher," which is what they mean. Phonetic literacy is especially popular among students who are busy with production tasks and women with heavy household burdens, because pinyin letters provide such a convenience: allowing them to use breaks from work to learn Chinese characters on their own with the help of the letters.

Phonetic literacy is of good quality, easy to learn independently, and conducive to consolidation and improvement, which is a shortcut to eliminating illiteracy. According to the experience of various places, workers and peasants can generally learn pinyin letters in a dozen to twenty hours; an illiterate person can graduate from literacy classes in just one or two months (one and a half hours a day) from learning pinyin letters. For worker and peasant students, mastering pinyin letters not only plays a beneficial role in literacy, but also is a consistently effective and favorable factor for continuous improvement after literacy graduation. At present, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Henan, Liaoning, Jilin and other provinces, some are conducting typical experiments in phonetic literacy, some are training teachers, and some have entered the stage of full implementation. We believe that this phonetic literacy method can be applied in the national Mandarin-speaking areas (except for ethnic minority language areas, parts of Jiangsu, and parts of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, all other provinces in the country belong to Mandarin-speaking areas). We can first conduct pilot projects to gain experience, and then gradually promote it.

Secondly, pinyin letters are an effective tool for promoting Mandarin. After the Chinese Pinyin Scheme was approved by the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress in February 1958, most primary schools, middle schools and normal schools across the country have begun teaching pinyin letters and Mandarin, and the number of people learning is estimated to be over 50 million. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, many places across the country, under the call of the local Party committees, have closely combined with production and various central tasks, and launched a movement to promote Mandarin in the method of vigorously launching mass movements, and achieved great results. As regions collaborate, visit each other, and exchange experiences more and more frequently, people increasingly feel the urgent need for Mandarin.

There are different approaches to promoting Mandarin in different places. From the experiences of various places, no matter which method is used, it is necessary to enable the masses to master pinyin letters in a timely manner and provide certain annotated readings, so that the work of promoting Mandarin can be consolidated and improved. Promoting Mandarin is naturally a long-term and arduous task, so mass movements must be combined with regular work, and teaching pinyin letters is the most important measure to make the use of Mandarin by the masses a regular practice. Some places did not teach pinyin letters in time when promoting Mandarin, and the masses had this reaction: "Mandarin is good, but it's easy to learn but hard to remember, and there's nothing to hold on to when you forget." This proves that there must be a set of phonetic tools for promoting Mandarin. Pinyin letters are the best "handle" for learning Mandarin.

Promoting Mandarin is an important political task that is beneficial to the further development of our country's politics, economy, and culture. In order to further standardize our Chinese language so that it can better serve our country's socialist construction, we must continue to vigorously promote Mandarin. In the work of promoting Mandarin, we must give full play to the role of pinyin letters in order to put this work on a solid and reliable foundation.

    拼音字母为扫盲和推广普通话开辟了捷径
    本报评论员
    目前全国青壮年中还有很大一批文盲需要扫除；已经扫盲毕业的学员中一部分回生的需要回熟和巩固，已经巩固的需要进一步提高。继续扫盲并巩固和扩大扫盲成果，是当前教育工作中的一个重大的任务。因此，今年必须继续鼓足干劲，采取各种切实有效的办法，利用一切有利的时机，在工农群众中认真开展扫盲工作，包括扫盲以后的巩固提高工作。
    山东、河北、江苏、黑龙江等省注音扫盲（用拼音字母给汉字注音的办法来扫盲）的经验证明，拼音字母确实是巩固扫盲成果的有力工具。汉字在学习上的一个主要困难，就是一个字应该怎么念，一般在字面上看不出来，必须由老师一个一个地教。如果学员忘了，必须由老师重新教过。现在用拼音字母给汉字注音，就解决了汉字教学上的一大困难。只要学员学会了拼音字母和拼音方法，就可以通过注音的课本和读物学习汉字；遇到生字，只要把字母一拼，就知道这个字该怎么念了。许多群众赞扬拼音字母，说它是“认字的法宝”，“不说话的老师”，就是指这个说的。注音扫盲尤其受到生产任务忙的学员和家务负担重的妇女的欢迎，因为拼音字母提供了这样一个便利条件：使他们可以利用劳动间隙，依靠字母自学汉字。
    注音扫盲质量好，便于自学，有利于巩固提高，是扫除文盲的捷径。根据各地经验，工农群众，一般经过十几小时到二十小时可以学会拼音字母；一个文盲，从学习拼音字母到扫盲毕业，不过一、两个月的时间（每天一小时半）。对于工农学员来说，掌握拼音字母不仅对扫盲起有利的作用，而且对扫盲毕业以后的不断提高，是个经常起作用的有利因素。目前山东、河北、江苏、黑龙江、河南、辽宁、吉林等省，有的在作注音扫盲的典型试验，有的正在培训师资，有的已经进入全面推行。我们认为，在全国普通话地区（除了少数民族语区、江苏的一部分、和浙江、福建、江西、湖南、广东、广西的一部分等汉语方言区以外，全国其他各省都属于普通话区），都能适用这个注音扫盲的办法，可以先经过试点取得经验，然后逐步推广。
    其次，拼音字母又是推广普通话的有效工具。汉语拼音方案在1958年2月经全国人民代表大会一届五次会议批准以后，全国绝大部分小学、中学和师范学校已经开始教学拼音字母和普通话，学习的人数估计已在五千万以上。特别从1958年大跃进以来，全国许多地方在当地党委的号召之下密切结合生产、结合各项中心工作，以大搞群众运动的方法掀起了推广普通话运动，取得了很大的成绩。由于目前各地区之间互相协作，互相参观，交流经验，日益频繁，人们越来越感到普通话的迫切需要。
    推广普通话，在各地有不同的做法。从各地的经验看来，不论用哪一种办法，都必须及时使群众掌握拼音字母，并且供应一定的注音读物，推广普通话的工作才能得到巩固和提高。推广普通话自然是一项长期的、艰巨的任务，因此群众运动必须与经常工作相结合，而教学拼音字母就是使群众使用普通话经常化的最重要的一个措施。有些地方推广普通话没有及时教学拼音字母，群众有这样的反映：“普通话好是好，就是好学不好记，忘了没抓手。”这证明了推广普通话必须有一套正音工具。拼音字母就是学习普通话的最好的“抓手”。
    推广普通话是有利于我国政治、经济、文化的进一步发展的一项重要的政治任务。为了使我们的汉语进一步规范化，使它能够更好地为我国的社会主义建设服务，必须继续大力推广普通话。而在推广普通话的工作中，必须充分发挥拼音字母的作用，才能使这个工作放在一个坚实可靠的基础上。
