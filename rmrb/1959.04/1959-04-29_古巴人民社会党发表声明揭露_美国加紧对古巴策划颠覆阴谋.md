Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 27th. The People's Socialist Party of Cuba published a statement in "Hoy" yesterday, calling on the people to heighten vigilance and unite to smash the US imperialist conspiracy against the Cuban revolution, which is currently being carried out at home and abroad in various insidious forms.

The statement revealed that Allen Dulles, head of the US intelligence agency, has put Colonel Knight in charge of subversive activities. The increasingly vicious propaganda and anti-communist provocations of recent weeks have been instigated and funded by US agents. Airplanes from the United States have also dropped Batista's newspapers and anti-Cuban government propaganda in some areas.

The statement also revealed that fascist groups are being trained to sabotage all actions supporting the revolution. A rally of the People's Socialist Party in Guantanamo City, near the US Naval Base at Caimanera, was attacked by such groups. In addition, activities such as destroying buildings and assassinations have begun.

The statement pointed out that while some people are promoting the idea that Castro and other leaders are pursuing "extremist" policies, they are also wooing certain officers in the army, asking them to "save" the revolution from "extremism." Tense propaganda against the government and revolutionary laws is also being quietly conducted among conservative groups and businessmen.

The statement also revealed that the leader of a group of volunteers who were recently intercepted by the Cuban government and intended to go to Nicaragua to carry out a revolution was originally a US agent (who has been arrested). The statement pointed out that Panama is hysterically demanding that the Organization of American States take measures to protect it from Cuban "aggression," and the Dominican Republic has declared a so-called state of emergency, all of which are creating conditions for aggression against Cuba.

The statement finally called on workers, peasants, other social strata, and all revolutionary parties to strengthen unity within the rebel army and the government, heighten vigilance, mobilize all forces to smash this conspiracy, defend the revolution, and keep it moving forward.

    古巴人民社会党发表声明揭露
    美国加紧对古巴策划颠覆阴谋
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　古巴人民社会党昨天在“今日报”上发表了一项声明，号召人民提高警惕和团结一致，以粉碎美帝国主义反对古巴革命的阴谋，这个阴谋目前正以各种险恶的形式在国内外同时进行。
    声明揭露，美国间谍机关的头子艾伦·杜勒斯已经让奈特上校负责颠覆活动。这几星期来变本加厉的恶毒宣传和反共挑衅行为就是美国特务挑起和资助的。来自美国的飞机还在某些地方投下了巴蒂斯塔的报纸和反对古巴政府的宣传品。
    声明还揭露，有人在训练法西斯集团，用以破坏一切支持革命的行动。人民社会党在卡伊马内拉美国海军基地附近关塔那摩城的一次集会就曾遭到这类团体的袭击。此外，破坏建筑物和暗杀的活动已经开始。
    声明指出，还有人在宣传卡斯特罗及其他领导人奉行“极端主义”政策的同时，在军队里拉拢某些军官，要他们从“极端主义”中“拯救”革命。在保守集团和商人中也正在悄悄地进行反对政府和革命法律的紧张宣传。
    声明还揭露，最近被古巴政府截住的一群打算去尼加拉瓜进行革命的志愿人员的领袖，原来就是个美国特务（此人已被逮捕）。声明指出，巴拿马在歇斯底里地要求美洲国家组织采取保护它免遭古巴“侵略”的措施，多米尼加宣布了所谓的紧急状态，这些都是为了对古巴进行侵略创造条件。
    声明最后号召工人、农民、其他社会阶层和一切革命党派在起义军和政府中加强团结，提高警惕，动员一切力量粉碎这个阴谋，保卫革命并使革命继续前进。
