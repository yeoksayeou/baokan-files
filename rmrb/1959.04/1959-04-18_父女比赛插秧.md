　　Father and Daughter Rice Planting Competition

　　In the Dongfanghong Production Team of the Changshan Commune in Qu County, Zhejiang Province, there is a twenty-one-year-old girl named Jiang Songying. Recently, she participated in the rice planting training meeting held by the commune's Women's Federation for several nights. After returning home, she even dragged the straw from her bed and used it as seedlings to practice rice planting on the ground. During the day, she went to the fields with the girls to practice rice planting. One day, Jiang Shuiqing, the leader of the production team, saw Songying planting rice and praised her repeatedly, saying, "Songying's seedlings are planted quickly and well, and they meet the standards."

　　These words reached her father, Jiang Zhankui. Jiang Zhankui didn't believe that his daughter could plant rice and said, "If the duck can find grains, the chicken will starve to death." Jiang Shuiqing said, "If you don't believe it, go and see!" Jiang Zhankui came to the field and saw Songying really planting rice, and thought: I haven't taught her, how can she plant rice! At this time, Wang Ziying smiled and said, "Uncle Zhankui, why not have a competition with your daughter!" Jiang Zhankui has forty years of rice planting experience, and is a master of all kinds of farm work. The villagers call him a "one-finger onion peeler." He himself believed that Songying had just learned to plant rice, how could she beat him. He smiled and said to his daughter: "Songying, let's have a competition!" Songying was sorting out the seedling bundles, and when she heard her father say he wanted to compete with her, she couldn't help but feel a little flustered. She thought: My father is an experienced rice planter, and I am a novice, how can I beat him? So Songying said, "Dad, I won't compete with you." Jiang Shuiqing, the leader of the production team, interjected, "Songying, it doesn't matter if you can't beat him, he is still your father." Songying thought that the competition was to promote production, so she said, "Let's compete then."

　　As soon as the whistle sounded, the father and daughter started the competition. At this time, the daughter used all the skills she had learned in three days, and the father used his old skills. The result of the first competition was that Jiang Zhankui planted only forty-five clusters of seedlings in one minute, while Jiang Songying planted fifty-nine clusters of seedlings in one minute. The father lost to his daughter. However, Jiang Zhankui complained that he had not done a good job in preparation, and said, "It doesn't count, it's not well prepared, let's do it again." Songying beat her father and thought: Why did my father plant fewer clusters even though he is an experienced rice planter? It turned out that Jiang Songying was learning the fast rice planting method of Chai Shuina, a rice planting expert in the county, which was faster than Jiang Zhankui's old method of rice planting. Now that she heard her father say that he wanted to compete with her again, she became more and more courageous.

　　The second competition began, Jiang Zhankui was extremely nervous, he was not used to planting in the 5×2 close planting pattern, and he was worried about losing to his daughter. He tried his best to plant, and planted only forty-eight clusters of seedlings in one minute, while Jiang Songying planted fifty-two clusters of seedlings, losing again. Jiang Zhankui was still not convinced, and said, "Let's do it again, three times to decide the winner."

　　The result of the third competition was that Jiang Songying planted sixty-eight clusters of seedlings in one minute, while Jiang Zhankui planted fifty-eight clusters of seedlings. The daughter planted ten more clusters than the father. The father felt very strange and began to look for the reason. He carefully watched his daughter planting rice. Jiang Songying planted nine clusters in a row, but he only planted seven clusters in a row; Jiang Songying shuttled back and forth to plant, but he always planted from left to right, and his footwork was not as good as his daughter's. After watching, the old man was convinced and sighed, "The old method is no longer useful, I have to learn the new method, let's compete again in three days!"

　　父女比赛插秧
    浙江省衢县常山公社东方红生产队，有个二十一岁的姑娘，名叫江松英。最近几个晚上，她参加了公社妇联召开的插秧练兵会。回家后，还把床上的稻草拖下来当秧苗，在地上练习插秧。白天，她又同姑娘们到田里去练习插秧。一天，生产队长江水清看到松英在插秧，连声称赞说：“松英的秧插得又快又好，又合标准。”
    这话传到她父亲江占奎那里，江占奎不相信自己女儿能够插秧，并说：“鸭会抓粒，鸡就要饿死。”江水清说：“不信，你去看看吧！”江占奎来到田里，看松英真的在插秧，心想：我还没有教过她，她怎么会插秧呀！这时，王紫英笑着说：“占奎伯，和女儿赛一下吧！”江占奎有四十年插秧经验，样样农活都是一把手，村里人称他是“一个指头能剥葱”的能人。他自己也认为松英刚学插秧，怎么能赛过自己。他就笑着对女儿说：“松英，我们两人赛一赛吧！”松英正在整秧把，听父亲说要和她比赛，不由心里有点着慌。她想：父亲是个插秧老手，自己是个新手，怎么赛得过他？于是松英就说：“爸爸，我不和你赛。”生产队长江水清插嘴说：“松英，赛不过也是自己的父亲，没关系。”松英想到比赛是为了推动生产，便说：“赛就赛。”
    哨子一响，父亲和女儿就赛起来了。这时，女儿把三天学到的本领尽往外使，父亲呢，老本领也用出来。第一次比赛结果，江占奎一分钟只插四十五丛秧，江松英一分钟插五十九丛秧，父亲输给女儿。但是，江占奎埋怨自己准备工作没做好，就说：“不算不算，没有准备好，再来一次。”江松英赛过了父亲，心想：父亲是老插秧手为什么丛数比我少呢？原来，江松英学习的是全县插秧能手柴水娜的快速插秧法，比江占奎老办法插秧要快。现在听父亲说要和她再比一次，胆子愈来愈大了。
    第二次比赛开始，江占奎紧张极了，这是5×2密植插得不习惯，那里又担心赛不过女儿。他拚命插，拚命插，一分钟只插到四十八丛秧，而江松英却插到五十二丛秧，又比输了。江占奎还是不服，又说：“再来一次，三次见输赢。”
    第三次比赛结果，江松英一分钟插六十八丛秧，江占奎插五十八丛秧，女儿比父亲多插十丛秧。父亲感到非常奇怪，便开始找原因。他仔细地看着女儿插秧。江松英一行插九丛，可是他一行只插七丛；江松英左右来回穿梭插，可他老是从左到右插，脚步也没女儿退得好。看过以后，老汉服啦，感叹地说：“老办法用不得了，我也要学新办法，三天后再赛赛吧！”
