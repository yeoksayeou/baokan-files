　　Xinhua News Agency, Wellington, April 11th: The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting concluded yesterday after three days of sessions. The communique issued after the meeting confirms that, under the command and instigation of the United States, this meeting formulated new sinister plans to expand aggression against Asian countries and intensify military provocations and subversive activities in the Asian region. The meeting communique also maliciously slandered and attacked the Chinese people in an attempt to poison the international atmosphere in Asia and conceal the conspiracies planned by this military bloc against China and other Asian countries. The above situation shows that this aggressive group, which is the source of tension in Asia, has increasingly increased its threat to peace and security in the region.
　　The communique issued by the meeting vigorously touted the “deterrent force” of this aggressive group. As can be seen from the information revealed in the communique, the meeting has made various arrangements regarding military conspiracies, which it focused on discussing, in order to strengthen the suppression of national independence movements in Southeast Asian countries and launch new military provocations in the coming period.
　　The communique stated that "the Council noted and approved the reports of the military advisors and their recommendations for future activities." The communique reiterated the need to continue planning "defense" measures. Western news agencies have revealed that the recommendations made by the military advisors of this aggressive group include plans to establish a mobile aggressive force. It is reported that in the process of planning this military conspiracy "in great detail," the meeting has ordered the military planners of this aggressive group to "draft" a "blueprint" for further interference in the internal affairs of Laos, and also extensively discussed the situations in Cambodia, Indonesia, and Burma. There are reports that the meeting also discussed the establishment of nuclear and rocket weapons bases in Southeast Asian countries.
　　The communique stated that "the efficiency of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization must rely on the ability of its forces to conduct joint operations. Therefore, the Council unanimously agreed to a plan for military exercises in the coming year." Earlier reports indicated that this aggressive group has formulated plans to hold larger and more frequent military exercises in the future.
　　The communique also specifically emphasized that this aggressive group will continue to strengthen its so-called "counter-subversion activities" in the future. The communique announced that the meeting has decided to convene a "conference of counter-subversion experts" in Pakistan. This situation shows that the United States will intensify its use of this aggressive group to plan subversive activities against Asian countries and strengthen its control over certain countries in the region.
　　The communique emphasized the argument that the "security" of any region is inseparable from the "security" of other regions, and advocated the conspiracy, discussed at the meeting, to strengthen the links between the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact Organization in order to jointly coordinate the sabotage of world peace. The communique stated that the Council "noted" the report of the Secretary-General of this aggressive group, Sarasin, on his visit to the North Atlantic Treaty headquarters and the Baghdad Pact headquarters, and believed that "maintaining contacts of this nature" with these two aggressive groups "facing similar tasks and problems" is "valuable."
　　It is particularly noteworthy that the United States is also openly attempting to use this aggressive group to rudely interfere in China's internal affairs and plot new conspiracies against the Chinese people. The communique mentioned the so-called "Formosa (Taiwan) issue" and clamored that the Chinese people's actions to liberate their own territory would be met with "firm resistance." This clamor in the communique shows that the United States will stubbornly adhere to its policy of long-term hostility towards the Chinese people, and exposes the conspiracy of the United States to launch new provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait region.
　　The communique confirmed that the meeting also discussed another issue that is purely China's internal affair, namely the Chinese government's resolute suppression of the rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet. The communique expressed so-called "concern" about the "situation in Tibet" and expressed "disgust" at the Chinese government's actions to quell this rebellion, which were warmly supported by all ethnic groups in China, slandering these actions as "violence and oppression."
　　The communique also expressed "concern regarding the impact of communist economic activities in the treaty area," clamoring that the "motives" of "communist economic activities" "should be identified and exposed." This is another "new type of weapon" against China that the communique picked up after acknowledging that there "had been no" so-called communist military aggression in the Southeast Asian region. As is well known, the United States, which is trying to undermine the normal relations between Southeast Asian countries and China, has recently been conducting similar provocative propaganda in the Southeast Asian region.
　　When discussing economic issues, the meeting communique had to admit the adverse consequences caused by participating in this aggressive group to some countries, especially Asian member states, in various aspects. The communique confessed that these "problems arising from treaty obligations" include "lack of skilled workers, excessive burdens caused by defense preparations, and the needs of underdeveloped areas."
　　Despite this, the communique still emphasized that Western countries' economic "aid" to Asian countries has been provided through the "Colombo Plan, the United Nations, and bilateral programs," without giving any substantial satisfaction to the aid requests made by Asian member states. It has been previously reported that Thailand, Pakistan, and the Philippines, the three Asian member states, have strongly demanded that Western member states increase their economic "aid" to them and have "unanimously demanded that their Western allies should make the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization primarily an aid organization."
　　As can be seen from the communique, in order to ease the resentment of Asian member states and perfunctorily address their economic demands, the United States hypocritically promised to allocate funds to "begin establishing an institution specifically for cholera research by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." According to Western news agencies, the funds allocated by the United States for this purpose are only $400,000. It was announced that the meeting also vaguely expressed its agreement to "consider" the possibility of establishing "rural development centers" in Asian member states, perfunctorily addressing the request made by the Thai representative.

### 在美国指挥和策动下  东南亚集团制订新的侵略计划  决定加紧对亚洲国家进行军事挑衅和颠复活动

　　在美国指挥和策动下
　　东南亚集团制订新的侵略计划
　　决定加紧对亚洲国家进行军事挑衅和颠复活动
    新华社11日讯　惠灵顿消息：东南亚条约组织理事会会议在举行了三天会议以后，已经在昨天结束。会后发表的公报证实，这次会议在美国的指挥和策动下，制订了扩大对亚洲国家的侵略、加紧在亚洲地区进行军事挑衅和颠复活动的新的罪恶计划。会议公报还对中国人民进行了恶毒的诬蔑和攻击，企图毒化亚洲地区的国际气氛，并且掩饰这个军事集团对中国和其它亚洲国家策划的阴谋。上述情况表明，这个作为亚洲紧张局势根源的侵略集团已经日益增加了它对这个地区的和平和安全的威胁。
    这次会议发表的公报竭力鼓吹这个侵略集团的“威慑力量”。从公报透露的情况中可以看出，会议已经在它曾经侧重讨论的军事阴谋方面作了种种安排，以便在今后一个时期加强镇压东南亚国家民族独立运动和发动新的军事挑衅。
    公报说，“理事会注意到并批准了军事顾问的报告和他们关于今后活动的建议”。公报重申有必要继续策划“防御”措施。西方通讯社曾经透露，这个侵略集团的军事顾问们提出的建议中，包括建立它的一支机动侵略部队的计划。据透露，会议在“极其详尽地”策划这一军事阴谋的过程中，已经命令这个侵略集团的军事策划人员“草拟”一项进一步干涉老挝内政的“蓝图”，还广泛讨论了柬埔寨、印度尼西亚和缅甸的局势。有消息说，会议还讨论了在东南亚国家建立核武器和火箭武器基地的问题。
    公报说，“东南亚条约组织的效率必须依靠它的部队联合作战的能力。因此，理事会一致同意在下一年度进行军事演习的计划”。早先有消息说，这个侵略集团已经制订了在今后举行规模更大、次数更为频繁的军事演习的计划。
    公报还特别强调这个侵略集团在今后要继续加强它的所谓“反颠复活动”。公报宣布，会议已经决定在巴基斯坦召开一次“反颠复专家会议”。这种情况表明，美国将加紧利用这个侵略集团来策划对亚洲国家的颠复活动和加强对这个地区的某些国家的控制。
    公报强调任何一个地区的“安全”同其它地区的“安全”是分不开的论调，鼓吹会议曾经讨论过的关于加强东南亚条约组织同北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约组织的联系以共同配合破坏世界和平的阴谋。公报说，理事会“注意到”这个侵略集团的秘书长沙拉信关于他访问北大西洋公约总部和巴格达条约总部的报告，并且认为同“面临类似任务和问题”的这两个侵略集团“保持这种性质的联系是有价值的”。
    特别值得注意的是美国还正在公开企图利用这个侵略集团来粗暴地干涉中国的内政和策划反对中国人民的新的阴谋。公报谈到所谓“福摩萨（台湾）问题”，并且叫嚷中国人民解放自己领土的行动将遭到“坚决抵抗”。公报的这种叫嚣表明，美国仍将顽固地坚持长期与中国人民为敌的政策，并且暴露了美国在台湾海峡地区发动新的挑衅行动的阴谋。
    公报证实，这次会议还讨论了另一个纯属中国内政的问题，即中国政府坚决平息西藏地方上层反动集团发动的叛乱的问题。公报对“西藏局势”表示所谓“关切”，并且对中国政府采取的、受到中国各族人民热烈支持的平息这次叛乱的行动表示“憎恶”，诬蔑这种行动是“暴力和压迫措施”。
    公报还表示“关心对于共产党的经济活动在条约地区的影响”，叫嚷什么“应该辨别和揭露”“共产党经济活动”的“动机”。这是公报在承认东南亚地区“没有发生过”所谓共产党军事侵略之后拣起来的又一个反对中国的“新式武器”。如所周知，力图破坏东南亚国家同中国之间的正常关系的美国最近一直在东南亚地区进行类似的挑拨性宣传。
    会谈公报在谈到经济问题时，不得不承认参加这个侵略集团对一些国家，特别是亚洲成员国在各方面造成的恶果。公报供认这些“由条约义务所引起的问题”包括“缺乏熟练工人、由于防务准备而造成的过分负担以及不发达地区的需要”。
    尽管如此，公报还是强调西方国家对亚洲国家的经济“援助”已经通过“科伦坡计划、联合国和双边计划提供”，而没有对亚洲成员国提出的援助要求给予任何实质性的满足。前已报道，泰国、巴基斯坦和菲律宾这三个亚洲成员国曾经强烈要求西方成员国增加对它们的经济“援助”，并且“一致要求它们的西方盟国应该使东南亚条约组织主要是一个援助机构”。
    从公报中可以看出，为了缓和亚洲成员国的愤懑情绪和搪塞它们的经济要求，美国伪善地允诺出款“着手建立一个东南亚条约组织用来专门进行霍乱研究的机构”。据西方通讯社透露，美国为此拨出的款项不过四十万美元。据宣布，会议还空空洞洞地表示同意“考虑”在亚洲成员国中建立“乡村发展中心”的可能性，敷衍了泰国代表提出的这项要求。
