Princess Wencheng's Journey to Tibet
Jinhua

"On the fifteenth day of the first month,
Princess Wencheng came to Tibet.
Don't be afraid of the wide grasslands,
There are a hundred good horses to welcome you!
Don't be afraid of the high snow-capped mountains,
There are a hundred docile yaks to welcome you!
Don't be afraid to cross the deep rivers,
There are a hundred horse-headed boats to welcome you!
This is a very good place,
Named Beigui Xiong;
Princess Wencheng brought so many grain seeds,
There are three thousand eight hundred kinds in total!"

This is the Tibetan people's favorite folk song, "Aima Linji." Princess Wencheng, how many Tibetan songs sing of her! How many endless stories praise her!

**Seeking a Marriage in Chang'an**

When the Tibetan King (then called the Tubo King) Songtsen Gampo was sixteen years old, he heard that the Tang Dynasty Emperor of the mainland had a Princess Wencheng. This princess was extraordinarily beautiful and exceptionally talented. She not only read widely but also possessed many skills. Countless people from all over came to Chang'an to seek her hand in marriage. Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty was determined to choose a clever and capable son-in-law for the princess. Songtsen Gampo was an ambitious, courageous, and handsome man, with many talented and capable ministers such as Gar, who were skilled in both literary and military arts, so he sent Gar, leading a hundred knights, with glazed armor and other gold and silver treasures as betrothal gifts, to the capital Chang'an to seek the princess's hand. Gar and the hundred knights traveled over mountains and rivers, enduring the hardships of the journey, and finally arrived in Chang'an.

At this time, four other places also sent envoys to seek the princess's hand. So, the emperor invited them and said, "There are five envoys who have come to seek a marriage. To avoid disputes, I can only ask you to compete in intelligence. Whoever is the most intelligent will have the princess marry his master." The five envoys all believed they were the most intelligent, so they agreed in unison. Then, an interesting and tense competition began.

**Five Trials for the Marriage Envoy**

The first time, the emperor had someone bring a bowl-sized, nine-curved bright pearl and asked them to pass a silk thread through the curved holes of the pearl. The other four envoys tried every possible method without success. Finally, Gar found a large ant, tied the silk thread to the ant's waist, put it into the hole, blew three breaths, and the ant crawled out of the other side of the hole, with the silk thread following!

The second time, the emperor had the horse groom bring a hundred mules and a hundred foals, asking them to identify the mother-child relationship. The other four envoys were studying the coat colors and features, but could not reach a conclusion. Gar quietly went to the horse groom and, pretending to chat idly, asked for advice. The horse groom had long heard that King Songtsen Gampo was intelligent and handsome, and seeing Gar's humility and sincerity, he secretly gave him an idea. Then, Gar had all the foals locked in the stable, only feeding them, not giving them water. The next day, the foals were released and driven into the herd of mules. The foals had not had a drop of water for a day and were unbearably thirsty, so they rushed to find their mothers to nurse. Gar calmly pointed out their mother-child relationships.

The third time, the emperor ordered that each of the five envoys be given a hundred jars of wine and a hundred sheep. They had to finish the wine and eat the mutton within a day, and also tan the sheepskins well. The other four envoys and their attendants hurriedly slaughtered the sheep, making the ground full of wool and blood. They then drank large bowls of wine, and before they had finished eating the meat, they were already drunk and staggering, and they couldn't care less about tanning the skins! Only Gar, in an orderly manner, had the hundred knights he brought line up, slaughter the sheep, drink the wine in small sips, eat the meat in small pieces, and tan the skins at the same time. In this way, they quickly finished the wine, ate all the meat, and tanned the skins. The men were not drunk, and the ground was clean and tidy.

The fourth time was one night when the palace suddenly started beating drums. The emperor summoned the envoys from various places to come to the palace immediately for a meeting. Gar thought that, as it was his first time in the capital and he was unfamiliar with the roads, he would make marks in important places to avoid getting lost. When he arrived at the palace, the emperor told them to return immediately to see who could get back to their residence first. Gar followed the marks he had made beforehand and quickly returned. The other four envoys, in their haste to come, had paid no attention to the route. Now they just wanted to get home as soon as possible, and ran around in the palace, eventually getting lost.

After several competitions, Gar emerged victorious each time. The envoys were all impressed by his intelligence and willingly conceded, allowing Gar to bring the princess back to Tibet. But the emperor wanted to test them one last time, so he had Princess Wencheng and many palace maids, a total of two thousand five hundred, put on the same clothes, wear the same jewelry, and dress exactly alike, gathering them together for the envoys to pick out. Whoever recognized the princess could take her back. These two thousand five hundred young women were all dressed in dazzlingly gorgeous clothes, with jade pendants jingling pleasantly, faces like the moon on the fifteenth, and figures as upright as arrows. Upon seeing them, not only the other four envoys lost their bearings, but even the resourceful Gar felt confused and flustered. He thought, seeing that success was within reach, how could he let it go to waste, but he had never seen the princess's face nor heard of any of her characteristics, what could he do?

At this time, he suddenly remembered that the landlady of the inn had said that she had served the princess, so he should go and ask her what the princess looked like. The landlady, upon hearing that the Tibetan king was young and handsome, and seeing Gar's amiability, had long approved of this marriage, so she told him all the princess's features. When Gar returned to the square, he saw that the four envoys had already made their choices, and fortunately none of them had chosen the princess. Gar breathed a sigh of relief and went to pick them out one by one. By the seventh one, he saw that this girl's face was fair and rosy, her whole body exuded a refreshing fragrance, there was a faint pattern of clouds and flowers on her left cheek, her right cheek looked like a lotus flower, and there was a red dot in the middle of her forehead, with a statue of a Bodhisattva sitting on top of the red dot. Gar looked left and right, and seeing that it was no different from the features described by the landlady, he recognized the princess.

**The Princess Enters Tibet**

The emperor, seeing how intelligent Gar was, could only imagine how wise the Tibetan king must be. To be able to become a good son-in-law today naturally filled him with joy. So, he prepared a rich dowry, equipping her with utensils, medicines, Han poetry, classics and histories, and books recording various production technologies—the Treasure Mirror of Three Hundred and Sixty Methods of Art, Sixty Methods of Craftsmanship, and also musical bands, musical instruments, grain seeds, silkworm eggs, a statue of Sakyamuni Buddha, etc., and dispatched a large number of craftsmen to go to Tibet with Princess Wencheng.

When Princess Wencheng arrived in Lhasa, she and King Songtsen Gampo held a grand wedding. From then on, the couple lived in love and worked together to govern Tibet. The craftsmen who followed Princess Wencheng to Tibet quickly spread the technologies of planting, weaving, architecture, papermaking, ink making, winemaking, pottery making, metallurgy, agricultural tool manufacturing, and milling. King Songtsen Gampo and many Tibetans also changed out of their felt robes and wore silk and satin.

Soon, Songtsen Gampo, according to Princess Wencheng's wishes, built the Jokhang Temple in the center of Lhasa. During the construction of the temple, the lake was filled in, the mountain was moved, bricks were fired, tiles were made, and even a spiritual goat participated in the work of filling the lake and laying the foundation. Even today, you can still see the goat's head exposed outside the wall of the Jokhang Temple! One day, Princess Wencheng came to inspect the Jokhang Temple construction site, and the workers looked at her enthusiastically. The sculptor who was carving the first lion was so engrossed in watching Princess Wencheng that he accidentally cut off the lion's nose. Later, in order to make them all uniform, all the lions lost their noses. What people see in the Jokhang Temple now are these noseless lions.

**Echoes of a Thousand Years**

After the Jokhang Temple was completed, Princess Wencheng enshrined the statue of Sakyamuni Buddha that she had brought with her, and often spoke in front of the Jokhang Temple, introducing the lifestyle and production experience of the motherland to the Tibetan people. Because Princess Wencheng was a devout Buddhist, Songtsen Gampo was influenced by her and greatly promoted Buddhism. From then on, Buddhism flourished in Tibet. Now, year after year, how many Tibetan compatriots piously go to the Jokhang Temple to worship the Buddha statue in the Jokhang Temple! To admire the Princess Willow in front of the Jokhang Temple—planted by Princess Wencheng herself, some say, it is her hair that has turned into the "Tang Willow"!

Princess Wencheng felt that it was difficult to popularize education without writing, so she advised Songtsen Gampo to create writing. Songtsen Gampo listened to her and created the Tibetan script.

Princess Wencheng also helped Songtsen Gampo formulate laws to punish evil and promote good, and adopted the sexagenary cycle for reckoning years. She stipulated the ten evil deeds that must be punished: killing, stealing, adultery, fraud, instigation, cursing, rumor-mongering, jealousy, evil thoughts, and betrayal, and the "Sixteen Essentials" that rewarded good deeds such as truthful speech, sincere behavior, harmony among relatives, and helping neighbors.

From then on, Princess Wencheng became a relative of the Tibetan people, and the fraternal relationship between the Tibetan and Han peoples became even closer. (Attached pictures)

    文成公主入藏记
    锦华
    “正月十五那一天，
    文成公主来到了西藏。
    不要怕过宽大的草原，
    那里有一百匹好马欢迎您！
    不要怕过高大的雪山，
    有一百匹驯良的牦牛来欢迎您！
    不要怕涉深深的大河，
    有一百只马头船来欢迎您！
    这是一个很好的地方，
    名字叫北规雄；
    文成公主带来的粮食种子真多呀，
    共有三千八百种！”
    这是藏族人民最爱演唱的民歌“唉马林几”。文成公主，多少只藏族歌子歌唱她！多少个说不完的故事赞颂她！
    长安求亲
    当藏王（当时称为吐蕃王）松赞干布十六岁的那年，他听说内地唐朝皇帝有一个文成公主，这位公主，美丽非凡，才能出众，不但广读诗书，而且还会多种手艺。各地到长安来向这位公主求婚的人不计其数。皇帝唐太宗一心要为公主选择一位聪明能干的女婿。藏王松赞干布是一位雄才大略、英武俊秀的人，手下又有许多如噶尔等能文善武、明达干练的群臣，于是他就派了噶尔，率领一百名骑士，带着琉璃宝甲等金银宝贝作为聘礼，前往国都长安求婚。噶尔和一百骑士，跋山涉水，备受旅途辛苦，终于来到了长安。
    这时，另外还有四个地方也派了使者前来求娶公主。于是，皇帝把他们请来，说道：“你们有五位使者来求婚，为了避免争执，只好请你们来比比智力，谁最聪明，就把公主嫁给谁的主人。”五位使者都认为自己最聪明，因此同声答应。接着，一场有趣而紧张的比赛开始了。
    五试婚使
    第一次，皇帝叫人拿来一颗碗大的九曲明珠，让他们将一根丝线，从弯曲的明珠孔中穿过去。别处的四位使者，想尽了办法也没有成功，最后噶尔找了一只大个儿的蚂蚁来，将丝线系在蚂蚁的腰上，放入孔中，吹了三口气，蚂蚁顺着孔从另一边爬了出来，丝线穿过去了！
    第二次，皇帝叫马夫赶来了一百匹骡马和一百匹马驹，要他们辨认出它们的母子关系来。别处的四位使者，有的在研究毛色，有的在研究特征，但都得不出要领。噶尔便悄悄地跑到马夫跟前，装作闲谈的样子，向马夫请教。马夫早就听说松赞干布王聪明英俊，又见噶尔虚心诚恳，因此就悄悄地替他出了主意。然后，噶尔便叫把所有的马驹全关在马厩中，只喂料，不饮水。到第二天，才放开马驹，赶入骡马群中，马驹一天未见滴水，口渴难忍，都急忙去找自己的母亲吃奶。噶尔从容地指出了它们的母子关系。
    第三次，皇帝令人给这五个使者每人一百坛酒和一百只羊。要在一天之内喝完酒，吃完羊肉，还要把羊皮揉好。其他四位使者和他们的随从，匆匆忙忙地把羊宰了，弄得满地又是毛、又是血，接着大碗大碗地喝酒，肉还没吃完，就已喝得酩酊大醉，哪里还顾得着揉皮子！只有噶尔，有条不紊地，让带来的一百骑士排成队，杀了羊，一边小口喝酒、小块吃肉；一边揉皮子。这样，很快就喝光了酒、吃完了肉，皮子也揉好了。人没有醉，地上也干净利索。
    第四次是在一个晚上，宫中突然敲起鼓来，皇帝传召要各处使者马上来宫中议事。噶尔想到，初来国都，道路不熟，为了不致迷途，就在要紧的地方做了记号。等到到了皇宫后，皇帝又叫他们立即回去，看谁先到自己的住处。噶尔沿着自己事先作好的记号，很快就回去了。其他四位使者，因来时慌张，毫没注意途径。这时只想早点到家，在宫中乱钻乱撞，结果都迷了路。
    经过几次比赛，噶尔都取得了胜利，使者们都叹服他的聪明，甘拜下风，情愿让噶尔将公主迎回西藏去。但是皇帝还要最后考一考他们，便让文成公主和许多宫女，一共二千五百名，穿上同样的衣服，戴着同样的首饰，打扮得一模一样，集合在一起，让使者们去挑认。谁认出了公主，谁就可以把公主迎去。这二千五百名青年女子，个个服装华丽耀目，环佩叮当悦耳，脸如十五的月亮，体如箭一样端庄。一见到她们，不但其他四位使者没了主意，就连机智的噶尔也意乱心慌。他想，眼看大功就要告成，哪能前功尽弃，可是自己既没见过公主的面，又没听说过公主有什么特征，怎么办呢？
    这时，他忽然想起，旅店的女主人，曾说她服侍过公主，还是去问问她公主的模样儿。女店主一来听说藏王青年英俊，二来见噶尔和蔼可亲，早就赞成这门亲事，因此一五一十地把公主的特征全告诉了他。噶尔回到广场时，见四处使臣都已挑好，幸而都不是公主，噶尔松了一口气，就去挨个儿挑认。到七个时，只见这位姑娘脸蛋儿白里透红光，全身清香扑鼻，左腮隐隐有云采花纹，右腮好似有莲花一样，脑门正中有个红点，红点上端坐着一尊菩萨像，噶尔左看右相，见和女店主说的特征不差分毫，便把公主认了出来。
    公主入藏
    皇帝见噶尔如此聪明，更可想见藏王的英明，今天能成为佳婿，自然满心欢喜。于是准备了丰盛的嫁妆，备办了器皿、药物、汉诗、经史，和记载各种生产技术的书籍——艺林三百六十法宝鉴，工艺六十法，和乐队、乐器、谷种、蚕种、释迦牟尼佛像等，并且派遣了大批工匠随同文成公主一齐进到西藏去。
    文成公主到了拉萨，和松赞干布王举行了隆重的婚礼。从此，夫妇恩爱，同心协力共同治理西藏。那些随着文成公主入藏的工匠，很快地把种植、纺织、建筑、造纸、制墨、酿酒、制陶、冶金、农具制造和碾磨等技术传布开来。藏王松赞干布和许多西藏人，也换下了毡裘衣，穿上了绫罗绸缎。
    不久，松赞干布根据文成公主的意愿，在拉萨寺中心修建了大昭寺。在建庙的时候，填平了湖，搬掉了山，烧成了砖，制成了瓦，最后连一只通灵的山羊都来参加了填湖奠基的工作，至今还能看到羊头露在大昭寺的墙外哩！有一天，文成公主到大昭寺修建工地来检查，工人们热烈地看着文成公主，正在雕第一只狮子的雕塑工人，看得忘乎其形，竟失手把狮子的鼻子削去。后来，为了一律，就使所有的狮子都失去了鼻子。现在人们在大昭寺里所见到的，就是这些没有鼻子的狮子。
    千年遗响
    大昭寺建成后，文成公主便把带去的那尊释迦佛像供奉了起来，并且常在大昭寺门前，向藏族人民演讲，介绍祖国内地生活方式和生产经验。由于文成公主笃信佛教，松赞干布受了她的影响，也大大提倡佛教了。从此，佛教在西藏大盛。如今，年复一年，多少藏胞们虔诚地到大昭寺去朝拜大昭寺里的这尊佛像！去瞻仰大昭寺门前的公主柳——那文成公主亲手栽植的，有人说，就是她的头发变成的“唐柳”啊！
    文成公主感到没有文字就难于普及教化，劝松赞干布创造文字，松赞干布听了她的话，创造了藏文。
    文成公主又帮助松赞干布制订了惩恶扬善的法律，采用了天干地支的纪年法。规定必须惩罚的杀生、偷盗、奸淫、欺诈、挑唆、咒骂、造谣、嫉妒、恶念、违叛等恶行十则，和奖励言语忠实、行为笃厚、敦睦亲族、帮助邻人等善行的“十六要”。
    从此，文成公主就成为西藏人民的亲人，西藏同汉族人民之间的兄弟关系，也更加亲密了。（附图片）
