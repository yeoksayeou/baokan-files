Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 18th:  Algerian Republic Provisional Government Minister of Culture, Tawfiq Madani, told Xinhua News Agency reporters tonight that he believed that holding "Algeria Week" would make the imperialists tremble, and would make the Algerian people realize that they are not isolated, and that all free people in Asia, Africa, and the world are extending their hands to them.

Speaking about the "Algeria Week" that began today, Madani said that the Algerian people, who have been fighting imperialism for five years, are determined to liberate themselves and achieve freedom and independence.

He said, "We believe that imperialism in the world is a whole, and the national liberation movement in the world is also a whole. Algerians are not only fighting for themselves, their struggle is also part of a battle against imperialism and enslavement. The proposition concerning Asian-African liberation and unity, which was concretely fixed at the Bandung Conference, is precisely what the Algerian struggle upholds." He said, "If the Algerian struggle achieves victory, it means that the Asian-African liberation movement will also achieve a victory."

He also expressed his hope that Arab countries and free Asian and African countries will provide the Algerian people with more material assistance to help them defeat French imperialism as soon as possible.

　　阿尔及利亚文化部长发表谈话
　　举行“阿尔及利亚周”将使帝国主义发抖
    新华社开罗18日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府文化部长陶菲克·迈达尼今晚向新华社记者发表谈话说，他相信，举行“阿尔及利亚周”将使帝国主义者发抖，并且使阿尔及利亚人民认识到，他们不是孤立的，亚非和全世界一切自由的人们都在向他们伸出手来。
    迈达尼就今天开始举行的“阿尔及利亚周”发表谈话说，同帝国主义进行了五年斗争的阿尔及利亚人民决心使自己获得解放，取得自由和独立。
    他说，“我们相信，世界上的帝国主义是一个整体，而世界上的民族解放运动也是一个整体。阿尔及利亚人不仅是在为他们自己而斗争，他们的斗争也是反对帝国主义和奴役的一场战斗的一部分。在万隆会议上以具体形式固定下来的关于亚非解放和团结的主张也正是阿尔及利亚的斗争所维护的东西。”他说，“如果阿尔及利亚斗争取得胜利，那就意味着亚非解放运动也取得一个胜利”。
    他还表示希望阿拉伯国家和亚非自由国家将供给阿尔及利亚人民以更多的物质援助，来帮助他们尽早击败法帝国主义。
