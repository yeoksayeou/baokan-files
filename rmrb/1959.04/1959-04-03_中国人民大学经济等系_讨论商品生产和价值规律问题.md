    The Economics and Other Departments of Renmin University of China
    Discuss Commodity Production and the Law of Value

On March 20th and 21st, under the auspices of the Scientific Research Department of Renmin University of China, a small-scale scientific discussion meeting was held, mainly by the Economics, Trade, and Planning Departments, to discuss the issue of commodity production and the law of value under the socialist system. More than two hundred people from both inside and outside the university participated in the discussion. Participants engaged in heated debates around the seven papers presented at the meeting, with approximately twenty people speaking at the meeting. A summary of the debated issues and differing opinions is as follows.

        On Commodity Production Under the Socialist System

Everyone agreed that socialist commodity production is a special type of commodity production that is fundamentally different from capitalist commodity production or simple commodity production. It does not reflect the relationship between private owners of the means of production.

Most comrades believed that there are mainly three types of exchange relationships in China's real economic life: (1) exchange relationships between the state and communes, and between communes; (2) exchange relationships between state-owned enterprises; and (3) exchange relationships between state-owned enterprises and state organs, and enterprise employees. Individual comrades believed there was a fourth type of relationship: exchange relationships within people's communes. Opinions varied greatly when linking these relationships to the meaning and causes of commodities, and in the specific analysis of their nature.

                    The Meaning of Commodity

In the discussion, most comrades believed that when discussing commodity production, one should first correctly understand the Marxist-Leninist meaning of the concept of commodity. They believed that the Marxist-Leninist understanding of commodity should be: a commodity is a unity of opposites with both use value and value, and it transfers ownership through equivalent exchange. Therefore, a commodity is not a thing, but an embodiment of the social relationship of exchanging equal amounts of labor between different owners. However, there were also significant differences among them: one opinion was that a correct understanding of the meaning of a commodity should not only be understood from the entire historical process of the commodity's emergence, development, and demise, but also from the specific economic conditions of the social system in which commodity production exists. Therefore, socialist commodities should have their specific definition. Another opinion was that commodities have their common essential attributes, so the definition of a commodity should be the same in any social system.

A fundamentally opposed opinion to the above views was that it is not necessary to first define the meaning of a commodity, because any definition is always relative and conditional. Starting from a definition does not help to delve into the problem. Individual comrades also believed that it is fundamentally wrong to analyze socialist commodity production using the definitions of commodities in the works of Marx and Engels, because they only studied commodity production under private ownership.

              The Scope of Commodity Production

Everyone agreed that commodities exchanged between the two forms of public ownership and between collective ownerships in the socialist economy are commodities in the true sense of the word. The main point of contention was whether the exchange relationships within the economy of ownership by the whole people are commodity relationships.

There were three different opinions on the nature of the means of production exchanged between state-owned enterprises. One opinion was that they are commodities in form only. The reasons given were: (1) they do not reflect the exchange relationship of equal amounts of labor between different owners of the means of production; (2) they achieve the direct allocation of the means of production under the state's unified planned allocation; (3) the exchange result does not transfer product ownership and does not affect the increase or decrease of the wealth of the economy of ownership by the whole people or the income of employees; (4) while commodity production certainly requires the exchange of equal amounts of labor, the exchange of equal amounts of labor is not necessarily commodity exchange. For example, the self-sufficient production within people's communes can also carry out accounting and distribution in the form of equivalent exchange between its subordinate enterprises and production units. Therefore, this exchange is essentially a planned allocation relationship by the state. The second opinion was that they are incomplete commodities. This is because they have lost the most essential characteristic of commodities—the labor exchange between different owners of the means of production; but on the other hand, the economic conditions of socialism determine that the allocation relationship between state-owned enterprises must also be realized through the principle of equivalent exchange, thus still retaining some characteristics of commodities. Therefore, this is a commodity close to extinction, a transitional form gradually transitioning from commodity exchange to direct product allocation. The third opinion opposed the above two views. They said that the means of production exchanged between state-owned enterprises are also completely socialist commodities. Because the exchange between state-owned enterprises is not all direct planned allocation, a considerable part is ordered by state-owned commercial institutions from factories according to market needs, or the production and sales are decided by contracts between state-owned enterprises; secondly, the equivalent exchange between state-owned enterprises is not only accounting, the level of prices, the amount of profit, and profit sharing also have a great impact on the enthusiasm of enterprises for production; thirdly, for enterprises, whether they sell their products to communes or other state-owned enterprises, there is no difference in commodity circulation plans, bank credit plans, etc.

There were four different views on the nature of consumer goods sold by state-owned enterprises to employees of the whole people. The first view was: employees are the masters of ownership by the whole people, labor power is not a commodity, and there is no labor exchange relationship between different owners of the means of production, so this is only a commodity in form. They said that the essence of this exchange relationship is direct labor exchange, a relationship of distribution according to labor. Whether the individual value of the products produced by state-owned enterprises is higher or lower than the social value does not affect the income of employees; if the actual income of employees increases or decreases due to the rise and fall of consumer goods prices, it is essentially only a redistribution of accumulation and consumption. This is different from the relationship and consequences reflected by commune members purchasing goods from state-owned enterprises. The second view was: although this part of consumer goods no longer reflects the exchange relationship between different owners of the means of production and is no longer a commodity, it still retains some of the characteristics of a commodity because it must still be sold through equivalent exchange. It can be said to be an incomplete commodity. The third view was: although this part of consumer goods no longer reflects the exchange relationship between different owners of the means of production, it is different from the means of production exchanged between state-owned enterprises; because there is individual ownership of consumer goods, the principle of equivalence must be implemented in the exchange, and the ownership of the product must be transferred, so this is still a substantial commodity (although extremely incomplete). The fourth view was: this type of consumer good is still a commodity. Because the exchange not only requires the principle of equivalence, but also transfers ownership. They opposed distinguishing consumer goods into complete commodities and incomplete commodities. They believed that this distinction is impossible to distinguish in practice, and the result of this distinction will obscure the internal contradictions between the state and individuals, making actual economic workers not pay attention to correctly stipulating prices to adjust this relationship.

              Reasons for the Existence of Commodity Production

Everyone agreed that the simultaneous existence of the two forms of public ownership is the fundamental reason for commodity exchange between the state and communes and between communes under the socialist system, and is also an important reason why products exchanged within ownership by the whole people take the form of commodities. However, opinions differed greatly on the internal reasons why the exchange relations within ownership by the whole people take the form of commodities. In particular, there was much debate on whether distribution according to labor and individual ownership of consumer goods are the reasons for the existence of this commodity form. The meeting focused on discussing the reasons why consumer goods exchanged within ownership by the whole people take the form of commodities. The main differing opinions can be summarized into these four:

The first opinion basically explains it from the existence of distribution according to labor. This opinion believes that since the principle of distribution under socialism is distribution according to labor, this requires the exchange of equal amounts of labor, and the existence of differences in labor must also be calculated in value, so that products become commodities.

The second opinion basically explains it from individual ownership of consumer goods. Some comrades believe that consumer goods belong to individual ownership, so there is still a "you and me" nature between the state and individuals, which requires equivalent exchange, so that consumer goods exchanged within ownership by the whole people take the form of commodities and become commodities. Some comrades believe that this is due to the coexistence of social division of labor and ownership by the whole people and individual ownership. Some comrades believe that it is only because of the existence of individual ownership of consumer goods. Some comrades believe that because the level of socialist productive forces is not yet high, it is necessary to use exchange to realize the distribution relationship, and at the same time, because of the existence of individual ownership of consumer goods, the two ends of the exchange are different owners, so the product distribution becomes commodity exchange.

The third opinion explains it from the contradiction between socialist public ownership and socialist productive forces. This opinion believes that public ownership requires fully and comprehensively meeting the diverse needs of social members, and the relatively low level of productive forces requires limiting and supervising consumption. Distribution according to labor is the solution to this contradiction, which determines the amount of consumption of individual members. However, what individual members obtain and how they obtain it within a quantitative range cannot be determined by distribution according to labor, nor is it what it wants to determine.

The fourth opinion believes that this is only a commodity in form, and its existence is due to the fact that a method for calculating the labor volume of products using direct labor time has not yet been found.

There are also three views on the reasons why the exchange of means of production between state-owned enterprises utilizes the form of commodities or becomes commodities. One view is that it is because ownership by the whole people in the socialist stage has not yet developed to a level sufficient to abandon the principle of equivalent compensation; one view is that it is because consumer goods, as commodities, determine that the means of production between state-owned enterprises must also calculate value; and another view is that it is because a method for calculating using direct labor time has not yet been found.

      On the Role of the Law of Value Under the Socialist System

Regarding this issue, the unanimous opinion in the discussion was that due to the existence of commodity production under the socialist system, the law of value also exists and plays a role. The main differences lie in the following two points:

First, whether the law of value has a regulatory role in the socialist economy. The first view is that in the socialist economy, the only things that regulate production are the basic economic laws of socialism and the planned proportional development law. The law of value does not play a regulatory role in the production of the two ownership economies, only a stimulating role; in the socialist circulation, most consumer goods are directly balanced by planned laws to balance supply and demand (such as rationed supplies, etc.). Only in the circulation of a portion of commodities (such as high-end consumer goods) does the law of value play a certain regulatory role. Comrades holding this view believe that the phenomenon of individual communes and individual products increasing or decreasing production due to price influences is often the result of violating objective economic laws, so this is individual, not general. They oppose the view that the national economic plan should be based on the law of value, saying that the first consideration in planning work is never the law of value.

In contrast, most comrades believe that the law of value still plays a certain regulatory role in the production of communes at the current stage in our country, especially for products with strong commodity characteristics (such as vegetables, etc.). The reason is that collective-owned enterprises are production units responsible for their own profits and losses, and the accumulation scale of the enterprise and the consumption level of the members depend on the income of the enterprise itself. Therefore, the level of prices will affect the economic interests of the commune and its members, which will also affect the allocation of means of production and labor for planting crops. Comrades holding this view believe that the problem of individual communes and individual crops being affected by prices leading to more or less production is a reflection of the objective law of value playing a role. And they say that acknowledging this is beneficial to making the state's economic work more and more meticulous, and it is also easier to overcome the destructive nature of the spontaneous action of the law of value.

Second, regarding the method of studying the role of the law of value. The first view is that the law of value expresses its role through prices, currency, etc., so studying its role should specifically study issues such as economic accounting, investment effects, price setting, and finance. The second view is that the law of value itself is different from the value form (prices, currency, etc.), and studying the role of the law of value under the socialist system should focus on proceeding from the social necessary labor volume determining the value volume. Therefore, the calculation method of investment effect, the formulation of financial credit plans, etc., cannot be explained solely by the law of value. (Wu Shuqing)

    中国人民大学经济等系
    讨论商品生产和价值规律问题
    3月20、21日，中国人民大学，在该校科学研究处的主持下，以经济、贸易、计划等系为主，召开了一次小型的科学讨论会，讨论了关于社会主义制度下商品生产和价值规律的问题。参加这次讨论会的有校内外人士二百余人。与会者围绕着在会上提出的七篇论文，展开了热烈的争论，在会上发言的约有二十人。现将争论的问题和不同意见，综述于下。
        关于社会主义制度下
          的商品生产问题
    大家一致同意，社会主义的商品生产是根本不同于资本主义商品生产或简单商品生产的特种商品生产。它不反映生产资料私有者之间的关系。
    大部分同志认为，在我国现实经济生活中，主要存在三种交换关系：（1）国家和公社、公社和公社之间的交换关系；（2）国营企业之间的交换关系；（3）国营企业和国家机关、企业职工之间的交换关系。个别同志认为还有第四种关系：人民公社内部的交换关系。在联系到商品的涵义、存在原因等问题和具体分析这几种交换关系的性质时，意见有很大的分歧。
                    商品的涵义
    在讨论中，多数同志认为，在讨论商品生产问题时，首先应该正确理解马克思列宁主义关于商品概念的涵义。他们认为，关于商品的马克思列宁主义的理解应该是：商品是具有使用价值和价值的矛盾统一体，它通过等价交换转移所有权。因此，商品不是物，而是不同所有者之间的互换等量劳动的社会关系的体现。但在他们之间也存在不小的分歧：一种意见认为，正确理解商品的涵义不仅应从商品的产生、发展和消亡的整个历史过程去理解，还得从存在商品生产的社会制度的具体经济条件去理解。所以社会主义的商品应该有其具体的定义。一种意见认为，商品有其共同的本质属性，所以不论在何种社会制度中，商品定义应该是共同的。
    与上述观点根本对立的意见认为，不必首先确定商品概念的涵义，因为任何定义总是相对的，有条件的。从确定定义出发，无助于问题的深入。个别同志还认为，根本不应该用马克思、恩格斯著作中的关于商品的定义来分析社会主义的商品生产，因为他们所研究的只是私有制下的商品生产。
              商品生产的范围
    大家一致认为，在社会主义经济中两种公有制之间和集体所有制之间交换的商品，是真正意义上的商品。分歧点主要是在全民所有制经济内部的交换关系是不是商品关系的问题上。
    关于国营企业之间交换的生产资料的性质有三种不同的意见。一种意见认为，它们是形式上的商品。所持理由是：（1）它根本不反映生产资料不同所有者之间的等量劳动的互换关系；（2）它在国家统一计划调拨下，实现生产资料的直接分配；（3）交换结果并没有转移产品所有权，并没有影响全民所有制经济财富的增减及职工的收入；（4）商品生产固然一定要求等量劳动的交换，但等量劳动交换并不就是商品交换。如人民公社内部自给性生产，同样可以等价交换形式在其所属企业与生产单位间，进行核算与分配。因此，这种交换实质上只是国家有计划的分配关系。第二种意见认为，它是不完全的商品。因为它已丧失了生产资料不同所有者之间劳动交换这一商品最本质的特性；但另一方面，社会主义的经济条件，又决定了国营企业之间的分配关系还要通过等价交换原则来实现，从而还带有商品的一部分特性。因此，这是一种接近消亡的商品，是由商品交换逐步过渡到直接产品分配的一种过渡形式。第三种意见反对上述两种看法。他们说，国营企业间交换的生产资料也是完全的社会主义商品。因为，国营企业之间的交换，并不都是直接计划调拨，有相当部分是由国营商业机构根据市场需要，向工厂加工订货，或是由国营企业间经过合同来决定产销的；其次，国营企业之间等价交换不单只是核算，价格高低、赢利多寡、利润提成等对企业生产的积极性也有很大影响；第三，对企业来说，无论将产品出售给公社或其他国营企业，商品流转计划、银行信贷计划等并不因而有所区别。
    关于国营企业卖给全国职工的消费品的性质，有四种不同看法。第一种看法是：职工是全民所有制的主人，劳动力不是商品，不存在生产资料不同所有者之间劳动交换关系，因此，这只是形式上的商品。他们说，这种交换关系的实质是直接的劳动交换，是按劳分配的关系。不论国营企业生产的产品个别价值高于或低于社会价值，并不影响职工收入；职工实际收入如因消费品价格的上下而发生增减，实质上只是积累与消费的再分配问题。这和公社社员到国营企业购买商品所体现的关系及后果都不同。第二种看法是：虽然这部分消费品已不反映不同生产资料所有者之间的交换关系，不再是商品，可是因为还必须通过等价交换来出售，所以还保存一部分商品的特性。可说是不完全的商品。第三种看法是：尽管这部分消费品已不反映不同生产资料所有者之间的交换关系，但它同国营企业间交换的生产资料不同；因为，存在着消费品的个人所有制，在交换中要贯彻等价原则，转移产品所有权，所以，这仍是一种实质商品（虽然是极不完全的）。第四种看法是：这种消费品仍然是商品。因为在交换中不仅要求等价原则，而且转移所有权。他们反对把消费品区分成完全的商品与不完全的商品。认为这种区分在实践上无法辨别，而这样区分的结果会掩盖国家与个人间的人民内部矛盾关系，使实际经济工作者不注意正确地规定价格去调整这种关系。
              商品生产存在的原因
    大家一致认为，公有制的两种形式同时并存，是社会主义制度下国家与公社、公社与公社间商品交换的根本原因，并且也是全民所有制内部交换的产品采取商品形式的重要原因。但是对于全民所有制内部交换关系为何采取商品形式的内在原因，意见却很分歧。特别是按劳分配与消费品个人所有制，是不是这种商品形式的存在原因问题，争论较多。会上着重讨论了全民所有制内部交换的消费品采取商品形式的原因。主要的不同意见可以归结为这四种：
    第一种意见基本上是从按劳分配的存在来解释的。这种意见认为，既然社会主义下分配原则是按劳分配，这就要求等量劳动交换，而劳动的差别存在，也必须用价值来计算，使产品成为商品。
    第二种意见基本上是从消费品个人所有制来解释的。有的同志认为，消费品是属于个人所有，从而国家与个人之间还有“你我”的性质，这就要求等价交换，使全民所有制内部交换的消费品采取商品形式和成为商品。有的同志认为，这是由于社会分工与全民所有制和个人所有制的并存。有的同志认为仅仅是因为消费品个人所有制的存在。有的同志认为由于社会主义生产力水平还不高，因此要利用交换来实现分配关系，同时，又由于消费品个人所有制的存在，交换的两端是不同的所有者，因此，产品分配就变成商品交换。
    第三种意见是从社会主义公有制和社会主义生产力之间的矛盾来解释的。这种意见认为，公有制要求充分而全面地满足社会成员多种不同需要，生产力发展水平相对低下又要求限制并督监消费量。按劳分配是这个矛盾的解决方法，它决定个别成员的消费量。但是在定量范围内个别成员取得什么与如何取得，却不是按劳分配所能决定，也不是它所要决定的。
    第四种意见认为，这只是形式上的商品，它的存在是由于尚未找到用直接劳动时间来计算产品劳动量的方法的缘故。
    对于国营企业之间生产资料的交换利用商品形式或成为商品的原因，也有三种看法。一种意见认为是由于社会主义阶段全民所有制还没有发展到足以抛弃等价补偿原则的水平；一种意见认为是由于消费品作为商品，决定了国营企业间生产资料也必须计算价值；另一种意见认为是由于还没有找到用直接劳动时间计算的方法。
      关于社会主义制度下
      价值规律的作用问题
    关于这个问题，讨论中一致的意见是：社会主义制度下由于商品生产的存在，价值规律也就存在并发生作用。主要分歧在于下面两点：
    第一，在社会主义经济中价值规律有无调节作用。第一种意见认为，在社会主义经济中，对生产起调节作用的，只有社会主义基本经济规律与有计划按比例规律。价值规律在两种所有制经济的生产中，都不起调节作用，只有刺激作用；在社会主义的流通中，绝大部分消费品是由计划规律来直接平衡供求（如定量供应等）。只有在一部分商品（如高级消费品）的流通中，价值规律才起一定的调节作用。持这种观点的同志认为，那种从个别公社、个别产品受价格影响而发生产量增减的现象，往往是违背了客观经济规律的结果，因此，这是个别，不是一般。他们反对把国民经济计划建立在价值规律基础上的观点，他们说，计划工作首先考虑的绝不是价值规律。
    与此相反，多数同志认为，价值规律在我国现阶段公社的生产中，还起一定的调节作用，对那些商品性强的产品（如蔬菜等），更是如此。原因在于集体所有制企业是自负盈亏的生产单位，企业的积累规模和社员的消费水平取决于企业本身的收入。因此价格高低，会影响公社与社员的经济利益，从而也会影响种植作物的生产资料与劳动力的分配。持这种意见的同志认为，个别公社与个别作物受价格影响而导致生产多寡的问题，是客观价值规律起作用的反映。并说，承认这点，有利于国家经济工作的越做越细致，也便于克服价值规律自发作用的破坏性。
    第二，关于研究价值规律作用的方法问题。第一种意见认为，价值规律是通过价格、货币等表现其作用的，因此研究它的作用应该具体研究经济核算、投资效果、价格制定以及财政等方面的问题。第二种意见认为，价值规律本身与价值形式
  （价格、货币等）是不同的，研究社会主义制度下价值规律的作用，应该着重从社会必要劳动量决定价值量出发来进行。因此，投资效果的计算法、财政信贷计划的制定等等，是不能单用价值规律来说明的。　（吴树青）
