	Half-Monthly International Review
	(March 16th to March 31st)
		
		The Socialist Camp in Full Bloom
	In the sunny March, the socialist camp is in full bloom and thriving. The people of all countries are confidently striving to complete their socialist and communist construction plans ahead of schedule, and to achieve new victories in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism.

	This year is the first year of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan, and the scale and speed of the Soviet economic construction have been unprecedentedly increased. This year, the Soviet Union's investment in the steel industry will increase by 30%; compared with last year, power generation will increase by 11%, oil production will increase by 12%, gas production will increase by more than 38%, and the production of the machinery manufacturing industry will also increase greatly. In order to complete the first year's production tasks of the seven-year plan ahead of schedule, the workers and staff of all industrial sectors in the Soviet Union are launching a vigorous socialist competition, proposing to complete the seven-year plan one, two, or even three years ahead of schedule. The 12th All-Soviet Trade Union Congress, held from March 23rd to 27th, assured the CPSU Central Committee that it would mobilize all Soviet workers and staff to strive to complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule. The Soviet communist builders have gotten off to a good start, and in recent days, industrial enterprises in various parts of the Soviet Union have reported good news of completing the industrial production plan for the first quarter of this year ahead of schedule.

	The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, held in mid-March, marked that the Polish people are entering a new period of advancing on the socialist road, and the congress adopted a resolution on the basic tasks of the party's policy, fully approving Comrade Gomulka's political line pointed out in the summary report of the Central Committee. The instructions on Poland's development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965, drafted by the congress, are a huge plan for building socialism. The plan stipulates that compared with 1958, Poland's industrial production will increase by 80%, agricultural production will increase by 30%, and the actual wages of workers and staff and the actual income of farmers will increase by 33% to 35% in 1965. The congress also determined the party's rural policy, which is to gradually realize agricultural cooperation while continuously developing agricultural and animal husbandry production. Through this congress, the Polish United Workers' Party strengthened the party's unity and its ties with the masses, strengthened its unity with the international communist movement, and strengthened its unity with the socialist camp. These will be the most important guarantees for the Polish people to build socialism.

	On March 21st, the Hungarian people solemnly commemorated the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Although the Hungarian Soviet Republic existed for only one hundred and thirty-three days before it was strangled by the imperialist reactionaries, the heroic struggle of the Hungarian proletariat will forever be recorded in the history of the Hungarian people's revolution and the international communist movement and will shine forever. Today, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Hungarian people are courageously advancing on the road of socialist construction. Recently, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held an enlarged meeting, putting forward new tasks to the people of the whole country, demanding that the main indicators of the national economy reach the 1960 level stipulated in the three-year plan by the end of this year, and striving to complete the three-year plan one year ahead of schedule.

	In the past half month, many socialist countries have formulated and announced plans for developing the national economy in 1959. It can be seen from the plans that the scale and speed of development are very large. Compared with 1958, the total industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic will increase by 11.1%, and agricultural production will also increase; Bulgaria's total industrial output value will increase by 27.8%, and total agricultural output value will increase by 73.9%; Albania's total industrial output value will increase by 17%, and total agricultural output value will increase by 26%. 1959 is the decisive year for the Mongolian People's Republic to complete the three-year plan from 1958 to 1960. The Third Session of the Third Great People's Hural of Mongolia, which opened on the 30th, is discussing the revised three-year plan. The revised plan stipulates that by 1960, the number of livestock in Mongolia will increase by 7.2% compared with 1957, the national sown area will be 2.1 times more than this year, and the total industrial output value will be 53.2% more than in 1957. The Korean people are striving to complete the first five-year plan two years ahead of schedule this year. Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out in his speech to the workers of the Kim Chaek Iron Works in Korea on the 23rd that the production of Korean pig iron alone should be increased by more than double in one or two years, and its output should reach four million tons in four or five years. The Vietnamese people are also working hard to complete the three-year plan. President Ho Chi Minh said recently in an interview with a Hungarian reporter that industrialization is developing rapidly in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; by 1960, 60% to 70% of Vietnam's agricultural cooperation will be completed.

	The socialist transformation of agriculture in many socialist countries is also developing rapidly. Following the upsurge of agricultural cooperation in Hungary, an upsurge of agricultural cooperation has also appeared in Romania. Recently, Romania announced that it would finally eliminate the remnants of exploitation in rural areas, which will help promote the progress of the cooperation movement. Czechoslovakia held a congress of unified agricultural cooperatives from the 19th to the 22nd. The congress assured the party and the government that it would basically complete the socialist transformation of rural areas within this year. Tsend, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, announced at the meeting of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia that at present, the number of farmers and herdsmen who have joined agricultural and animal husbandry cooperatives accounts for 96% of the total number of farmers and herdsmen in Mongolia, basically completing the cooperation of agriculture and animal husbandry.

	All of this shows that a socialist spring has come again.

		Diplomatic Trends of Western Countries
	Recently, the heads of government of Western countries have held frequent bilateral talks centering on the German issue. This situation reflects the differences among Western countries on the German issue and their current diplomatic predicament.

	After visiting Paris, Bonn, and Ottawa, British Prime Minister Macmillan arrived in Washington on the 19th of this month and began a four-day meeting with Eisenhower the next day. Washington is the end of Macmillan's visit over the past month. The purpose of his meeting with the US President is to discuss with Eisenhower a strategy to deal with the Soviet proposals based on the results of his "probing" of Soviet intentions in Moscow and exchanging views with De Gaulle and Adenauer, to eliminate the existing differences among Western countries on the German issue, and to get rid of the current passive position.

	The US-UK talks were conducted in extreme secrecy. However, according to reports from the US and British newspapers and disclosures from spokespersons on both sides, it can be known that although the issues involved in the talks were quite extensive, the main focus was on the Berlin issue and the summit meeting issue. The two sides have reached a preliminary agreement on holding a summit meeting this summer. Eisenhower has relaxed his preconditions for holding a summit meeting, and the United Kingdom has also changed its previous attitude that a summit meeting must be held regardless of the outcome of the foreign ministers' meeting. Commentators in the Western press have called this change in the attitudes of the United States and the United Kingdom "a compromise." Eisenhower's shift from fundamentally refusing to consider conditionally agreeing to hold a summit meeting shows that the United States can no longer completely ignore the strong pressure of world public opinion. Since the summit meeting is a general trend and unavoidable, Eisenhower can only go with the flow, just as the "New York Herald Tribune" said: "Do not give the world the impression that it is being forced to negotiate." In addition to this, there is another reason, which is that the United States wants to take back the initiative and leadership in the Western camp that the United Kingdom has seized in recent times. The British "Daily Express" wrote on the 23rd, commenting on the results of the US-UK talks: "President Eisenhower is eager not to deepen the impression among his people that everything is being led by the British Prime Minister."

	However, in addition to deciding to continue to adhere to the illegal rights of occupation in West Berlin and agreeing to hold a summit meeting, the United States and the United Kingdom still have serious differences regarding what kind of plan the West will put forward in the East-West talks. According to the Western press, Macmillan proposed to "freeze" armed forces and armaments in the Central European region, and tended to break the current deadlock on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing. However, Eisenhower expressed great indifference to this. On the German issue, the United Kingdom advocates seeking an expedient solution to the current situation in Germany, while the United States emphasizes that "the reunification of Germany is a matter of urgency." Therefore, the "New York Times" believes that the US-UK talks were only a "beginning," and "further talks and negotiations must be held before the Western countries reach a final agreement."

	Now, the hurdle of whether or not to hold negotiations has been broken. Western countries have had to agree that only negotiations are the only way to solve the Berlin issue and the German issue. This shows that the Soviet Union's peace proposals have great vitality. They are based on reality and will therefore continue to open up avenues for their realization. However, the fact that Western countries have expressed their acceptance of the proposal for negotiations is one thing, and whether they have genuine sincerity in the negotiations and hope to seek a genuine agreement is another. Judging from the recent replies of Western countries to the Soviet government, although they have suggested that a foreign ministers' meeting be held in Geneva on May 11 and a summit meeting be held this summer, they have left loopholes in the issue of the participating members and the agenda of the meeting. They are prepared to make a fuss on these issues and bargain with the Soviet Union when necessary. Recently, the Western press has also spread the news that the United States intends to raise the issue of German reunification, which the meeting has no right to discuss at all, at the East-West meeting, and to make the reunification of Germany a prerequisite for solving the Berlin issue. It is said that the United States is brewing a "imaginative" plan on the issue of German reunification. The purpose of this plan is to allow "Germans the freedom to choose alliances in order to ensure Germany's participation in the Western alliance." There are also reports that if any plan to "disengage troops or limit armaments in Central Europe" is discussed in the East-West meeting, Western countries believe that "Russian territory must be included." It is difficult to believe that these plans of Western countries are a manifestation of their sincerity in seeking a successful negotiation.

	What is even more noteworthy is that when Eisenhower spoke about the summit meeting at a press conference on March 25, he still believed that "a summit meeting would be a mistake unless people understand that the meeting has a good chance of reaching an agreement." He also stated that "the West intends to guarantee its rights in Berlin under any circumstances." The US "Star Evening News" also reported that Western countries may even use the method of blockading the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea to deal with the Soviet Union's measures to make West Berlin a demilitarized free city. French President De Gaulle also made belligerent remarks on the same day as Eisenhower, opposing a reasonable solution to the Berlin issue. West German Foreign Minister Brentano followed closely and repeated the old tune of so-called "free elections." All of this is reminding people that they must not be too optimistic about the outcome of the upcoming East-West meeting. The foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany are now holding a foreign ministers' meeting in Washington, and then a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council will be held in early April. After this, the attitude and countermeasures of Western countries towards the German issue and the East-West meeting can be revealed.

		Iraqi People Advance Victoriously
	The imperialists and foreign reactionary forces recently plotted the Shawaaf rebellion in Mosul, Iraq; however, in just one day, the Iraqi people put down the rebellion and achieved a great victory in defending the newborn republic.

	The rapid suppression of the Shawaaf rebellion was beyond the expectations of the imperialists and foreign interventionists. They had hoped that the rebellion could quickly spread from northern Iraq to southern Iraq, and hoped to see turmoil throughout Iraq. However, the imperialists and foreign interventionists made a wrong estimate of the situation, and their hopes burst like soap bubbles. Therefore, they lamented it, some said: the rebellion "failed" because it was "launched too early"; others simply expressed frustration and regret.

	Under the leadership of Prime Minister Qasim, the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people are more united after putting down the rebellion. In order to safeguard national independence and defend the fruits of the revolutionary victory, as Prime Minister Qasim pointed out, they are "uprooting imperialism." On March 24, Iraq officially announced its withdrawal from the "Baghdad Pact," which is a powerful encouragement to the Iraqi people's struggle to maintain national independence and freedom, and a major blow to imperialist forces. Baghdad Radio pointed out that Iraq has since become a free, independent, and sovereign country. It will establish relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries, on the basis of friendship, equality, and mutual benefit. On March 30, due to the complete bankruptcy of the Baghdad Pact, the British government was forced to announce the withdrawal of the last imperialist military base in Iraq, the Habbaniyah Air Force Base. At the same time, the Iraqi government also decided to establish an agency to supervise privileged oil companies.

	In order to defend and further consolidate this young republic, the Iraqi government has taken a series of resolute measures in accordance with the will of the people. The Iraqi Supreme Military Court opened a trial of the Shawaaf treason case and has sentenced four rebels to death. The Iraqi People's Resistance Forces will also establish a center in Diyala Province and conduct military training. In the rural areas of Iraq, the land reform decree promulgated on September 30 last year is being actively implemented. The Iraqi Supreme Land Reform Committee recently decided to directly lease state-owned land in Kut Province, southeast of Baghdad, to farmers. All these measures that meet the requirements of the people will enable the Iraqi people's cause of maintaining national independence and freedom to be continuously consolidated and developed.

	At the same time, the Soviet Union and Iraq signed an agreement on economic and technical cooperation. The Soviet Union agreed to provide Iraq with a loan of 550 million rubles. The technical assistance that the Soviet Union will provide to Iraq includes helping Iraq build many enterprises such as heavy industry, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry, food industry, and light industry, as well as many other industrial and agricultural projects. This agreement was warmly welcomed by the Iraqi people. An editorial in Baghdad's "People's Solidarity Daily" pointed out that the agreement will give play to Iraq's potential, promote the progress and prosperity of the people, and will liberate Iraq's trade and economy from the control of foreign monopoly capital.

	There is no doubt that the newborn Republic of Iraq, resolutely pursuing a policy of opposing imperialism, maintaining national independence, and peaceful neutrality, has been warmly welcomed by the people of Arab countries, Asian and African countries, and all progressive mankind. However, it is regrettable that the United Arab Republic has adopted an attitude towards the Republic of Iraq that is completely incompatible with the spirit of the Bandung Conference. Since the outbreak of the Shawaaf rebellion, especially after the rebellion was put down, the propaganda agencies of Cairo and Damascus launched a slander campaign against Iraq, anti-communists, and anti-Soviet. These interventionist activities of the UAR authorities have created the current tension between the UAR and Iraq, and are contrary to the interests of the unity of Arab countries and the cause of national independence. It is precisely because of this that the enemy of the Arab people—imperialism, especially American imperialism—is enthusiastically applauding these practices of the UAR authorities that violate the will of the Arab people. A United Press International dispatch from Cairo said: "The West suddenly finds itself on Nasser's side"; and "the West, which has long been called the enemy of imperialism here, has almost become a forgotten target."

	Facts show that imperialism is by no means reconciled to the victory of the Iraqi people's revolution. Not long ago, the United States signed bilateral military agreements with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, the remaining members of the "Baghdad Pact." On the one hand, US imperialism is still trying to use Turkey and Iran to threaten the peace and security of Iraq; on the other hand, it is stepping up its manipulation of the conspiracy to use Arabs to fight Arabs. The US "Newsweek" on March 24 even "predicted" that so-called "pro-Nasser elements" "may try to overthrow the Iraqi government again in the next two weeks."

	However, it can be asserted that all the subversive conspiracies of imperialism and foreign interventionist forces will fail, and the united and heroic Iraqi people, who have the strong support of the world's peaceful forces, will continue to advance along the road of victory!

     半月国际述评
    （3月16日到3月31日）
      社会主义阵营百花竞开
      阳春三月，社会主义阵营百花竞开，欣欣向荣。各国人民信心百倍地争取提前完成社会主义和共产主义建设的计划，争取在同资本主义的和平经济竞赛中取得新的胜利。
    今年是苏联七年计划的第一年，苏联经济建设的规模和速度都空前提高了。今年苏联发展钢铁工业的投资将增加30％；今年同去年比较，发电量将增加11％，石油产量将增加12％，煤气产量将增加38％以上，机器制造业生产也将大大增加。为了提前完成七年计划第一年的生产任务，苏联各工业部门职工正在热火朝天地展开社会主义竞赛运动，纷纷提出提前一年、两年甚至三年完成七年计划。3月23日到27日举行的全苏工会第十二次代表大会向苏共中央提出保证，将动员全体苏联职工力争提前完成七年计划。苏联共产主义建设者旗开得胜，最近几天，苏联各地工业企业纷纷传出提前完成今年第一季度工业生产计划的捷报。
    3月中旬举行的波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会，标志着波兰人民正在进入一个在社会主义道路上大步前进的新时期，代表大会通过了关于党的政策的基本任务的决议。完全批准哥穆尔卡同志在中央委员会总结报告中所指出的政治路线。代表大会所拟订的1959—1965年波兰发展国民经济的指示，是建设社会主义的巨大计划。这个计划规定：1965年同1958年相比，波兰工业生产将增加80％，农业生产将增加30％，职工实际工资和农民实际收入将增加33％到35％。代表大会还确定了党的农村政策，就是在不断发展农业和畜牧业生产的同时，逐步实现农业合作化。通过这次代表大会，波兰统一工人党加强了党的团结和同群众的联系，加强了同国际共产主义运动的团结，加强了同社会主义阵营的团结。这些将是波兰人民建设社会主义的最重要的保证。
    3月21日，匈牙利人民隆重地纪念了匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立四十周年。匈牙利苏维埃共和国虽然仅仅存在了一百三十三天，就被帝国主义反动派扼杀了，但是匈牙利无产阶级的英勇斗争将永远载入匈牙利人民革命和国际共产主义运动史册而永放光辉。今天，匈牙利人民正在匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导下，在社会主义建设的大道上奋勇前进。最近匈牙利社会主义工人党中央举行了扩大会议，向全国人民提出新的任务，要求到今年年底使国民经济的主要指标达到三年计划规定的1960年的水平，争取提前一年完成三年计划。
    在过去半个月中，许多社会主义国家制定和公布了1959年发展国民经济的计划，从计划中可以看出，发展的规模和速度都是很大的。1959年同1958年相比，德意志民主共和国的工业总产值将增加11.1％，农业生产也将有所增加；保加利亚的工业总产值将增加27.8％，农业总产值将增加73.9％；阿尔巴尼亚工业总产值将增加17％，农业总产值将增加26％。1959年是蒙古人民共和国完成1958—1960年三年计划的决定性的一年。30日开幕的蒙古第三届大人民呼拉尔第三次会议正在讨论修改后的三年计划。修改后的计划规定：到1960年，蒙古的牲畜头数将比1957年增加7.2％，全国播种面积将比今年增加二点一倍，工业总产值将比1957年增加53.2％朝鲜人民正努力争取提前两年在今年完成第一个五年计划。金日成首相23日向朝鲜金策制铁所工人讲话时指出，仅仅朝鲜生铁的生产一项，就要在一两年内提高一倍多，并且要在四、五年内使其产量达到四百万吨。越南人民也在努力完成三年计划。胡志明主席最近在答匈牙利记者问时说，工业化正在越南民主共和国迅速发展；到1960年，越南农业合作化将完成60％到70％。
    许多社会主义国家的农业社会主义改造也在迅速发展。继匈牙利出现农业合作化高潮之后，罗马尼亚也出现了农业合作化的高潮。最近罗马尼亚宣布，将最后消灭农村中剥削现象的残余，这将有助于推动合作化运动的进展。捷克斯洛伐克在19日到22日举行了统一农业合作社代表大会，大会向党和政府提出保证，今年内将基本上完成农村的社会主义改造。蒙古人民共和国部长会议第一副主席曾德在蒙古大人民呼拉尔会议上宣布，目前蒙古加入农牧业合作社的农牧户已占蒙古全国农牧户总数的96％，基本上完成了农牧业的合作化。
    所有这些都表明，一个社会主义的春天又来临了。
            西方国家的外交动向
    最近这段期间，围绕着德国问题这个中心，西方国家的政府首脑进行了频繁的双边会谈。这种情形，反映了西方各国在德国问题上的分歧和它们目前所处的外交上的困境。
    英国首相麦克米伦在访问了巴黎、波恩和渥太华之后，在本月19日到达华盛顿，并于翌日开始同艾森豪威尔举行了为时四天的会谈。华盛顿是麦克米伦最近一个多月来的访问旅行的终点。他同美国总统会谈的目的，就是要根据他到莫斯科去“试探”苏联意图和同戴高乐与阿登纳交换意见的结果，来跟艾森豪威尔共同商谈一个对付苏联建议的策略，消除西方国家在德国问题上现存的分歧，以摆脱目前的被动地位。
    美英会谈是在极端秘密的情况下进行的。不过根据美英报刊的报道和双方发言人的透露，可以知道，这次会谈所涉及到的问题虽然相当广泛，但主要还是探讨了柏林问题和最高级会议问题。双方已就今年夏天举行最高级会议这一点达成了初步的协议。艾森豪威尔对举行最高级会议的先决条件，已较前松动，而英国也改变了它先前认为不管外长会议结果如何最高级会议必须举行的态度。西方报刊的评论员们把美英态度的这种改变称为双方的“一种妥协”。艾森豪威尔从根本拒绝考虑到有保留地同意举行最高级会议的态度的转变，说明美国已不能对世界舆论的强大压力完全置之不理。既然最高级会议是大势所趋，不可避免，艾森豪威尔也只能顺水推舟，就像“纽约先驱论坛报”所说的：“不要给世界以这样的印象——它是被迫着拖去谈判的”。除此之外，这里边还有一个原因，就是美国要借此夺回最近一个时期来已让英国乘机抢了去的主动权和西方阵营中的领导权。英国“每日快报”23日在评论美英会谈的结果时这样写道：“艾森豪威尔总统急切希望不在他的人民中加深这种印象，以为一切事情都是英国首相在带头干。”
    但是，美英双方除了决定继续坚持占领西柏林的非法权利和协议举行最高级会议外，对于在东西方会谈中西方究竟拿出一个什么样的方案来，仍然存在着严重的分歧。据西方报刊透露，麦克米伦曾提出了在中欧地带“冻结”武装部队和军备的主张，并且倾向于打开目前在停止核武器试验问题上的僵局。但是艾森豪威尔对此表示十分冷淡。在德国问题上，英国主张对德国的现状寻求一种权宜的解决办法，而美国却强调
  “重新统一德国问题是当务之急”。因此，“纽约时报”认为美英会谈只不过是一个“开端”，在西方国家“取得最后协议前，必须举行进一步的会谈和谈判。”
    现在，要不要举行谈判这一关已经突破了。西方国家已不得不同意，只有举行谈判，才是解决柏林问题和德国问题的唯一出路。这说明，苏联的和平建议具有巨大的生命力，它是从现实出发的，因此总会为自己的实现不断地开辟道路。但是，西方国家表示接受谈判的主张，和它们是否对谈判抱有真正的诚意并希望寻求真正的协议，是两回事情。从西方国家最近给苏联政府的复照看来，尽管它们已建议在5月11日在日内瓦举行外长会议和在今年夏天举行最高级会议，但是在会议的参加成员和议程问题上还留下伏笔。它们准备在必要时在这些问题上做文章，同苏联进行讨价还价。最近西方报刊还盛传美国打算在东西方会议上提出会议根本无权讨论的德国统一问题，并且要以德国的统一为解决柏林问题的前提。据说美国正在酝酿一个关于德国统一问题的“具有想像力”的计划。这个计划的目的是让“德国人有选择结盟的自由，以便确保德国参加西方联盟”。还有消息说，如果在东西方会议中谈到在中欧“使军队脱离接触或限制军备的任何计划”时，西方国家认为“必须把俄国的领土包括进去”。西方国家的这种打算，很难使人相信就是它们谋求谈判成功的诚意的表现。
    而更值得注意的是，艾森豪威尔3月25日在记者招待会上谈到最高级会议时，仍然认为，“最高级会议将会是一个错误，除非人们都了解这次会议具有达成协议的良好机会。”他并且表示“西方打算在任何情况下保证它在柏林的权利”。美国的“明星晚报”还传出消息说，西方国家甚至可能用封锁波罗的海和黑海的办法来对付苏联使西柏林成为非军事化自由城市的措施。法国总统戴高乐也跟艾森豪威尔同一天发表好战言论，反对柏林问题的合理解决。而西德外长勃伦塔诺紧跟着又重弹所谓“自由选举”的老调。这一切都在提醒人们，决不能对即将举行的东西方会议的结果过早地表示乐观。现在美、英、法和西德四国正在华盛顿举行外长会议，接着还要在4月初召开北大西洋集团理事会会议。在这以后，西方国家对于德国问题和东西方会议的态度和对策，就可以显出眉目来了。
          伊拉克人民胜利前进
    帝国主义和外国反动势力最近在伊拉克的摩苏尔地方策划了沙瓦夫的叛乱；但是仅仅一天之间，伊拉克人民就扑灭了叛乱，取得了捍卫新生的共和国的巨大胜利。
    沙瓦夫叛乱的被迅速扑灭，出乎帝国主义者和外国干涉者的意料之外。他们本来希望叛乱能够很快地从伊拉克的北部蔓延到南部，希望看到伊拉克全国的动乱。可是帝国主义者和外国干涉者对局势作了错误的估计，他们的希望像肥皂泡一样地破灭了。于是他们慨叹系之，有的说：叛乱之“所以失败”，是因为“发动得太早了”；有的则干脆表示懊丧和遗憾。
    以卡塞姆总理为首的伊拉克政府和伊拉克人民在扑灭叛乱之后，伊拉克人民团结得更加紧密了。为了维护民族独立和保卫革命胜利的果实，正如卡塞姆总理所指出，他们正在“把帝国主义连根拔掉”。3月24日，伊拉克正式宣布退出“巴格达条约”，这是对伊拉克人民维护民族独立和自由的斗争的一个有力鼓舞，对帝国主义势力的一个重大的打击。巴格达电台指出，伊拉克从此就成了一个自由、独立和拥有完整主权的国家。它将在友好、平等和互利的基础上同所有国家建立关系，特别是邻近国家。3月30日，由于巴格达条约的彻底破产，英国政府被迫宣布撤出帝国主义在伊拉克的最后一个军事基地哈巴尼雅空军基地。同时伊拉克政府还决定成立机构以监督拥有特权的石油公司。
    为了保卫和进一步巩固这个年轻的共和国，伊拉克政府根据人民的意志，采取了一系列坚决措施。伊拉克最高军事法庭开庭审讯沙瓦夫叛国案，并已判处四名叛乱分子以死刑。伊拉克人民抵抗部队也将在迪亚拉省建立中心，并进行军事训练。在伊拉克的农村，去年9月30日颁布的土地改革法令正在积极的执行中，伊拉克土地改革最高委员会最近还决定把巴格达东南部库特省的国有土地直接租给农民。所有这些符合于人民要求的措施，都将使伊拉克人民维护民族独立和自由的事业得到不断的巩固和发展。
    与此同时，苏联和伊拉克签订了经济技术合作协定。苏联同意给伊拉克贷款五亿五千万卢布。苏联将向伊拉克提供的技术援助包括帮助伊拉克建设重工业、机器制造业、化学工业、食品工业和轻工业等的许多企业以及许多其它的工农业项目。这个协定受到伊拉克人民的热烈欢迎，巴格达“人民团结报”的社论指出：协定将发挥伊拉克的潜力，促进人民的进步和繁荣，并且将把伊拉克的贸易和经济从外国垄断资本的支配下解放出来。
    毫无疑问，新生的伊拉克共和国坚决奉行反对帝国主义、维护民族独立与和平中立的政策，受到了阿拉伯各国、亚非各国人民和全体进步人类的热诚欢迎。但是，不能不令人遗憾的是，阿拉伯联合共和国却对伊拉克共和国采取了与万隆会议的精神绝不相容的态度，开罗和大马士革的宣传机构从沙瓦夫叛乱事件爆发以来，特别在叛乱被扑灭以后，发动了一个反伊拉克、反共产党人和反苏的诽谤运动。阿联当局的这些干涉活动造成了目前阿联和伊拉克之间的紧张关系，是违反阿拉伯国家的团结和民族独立事业的利益的。正是因为这样，阿拉伯人民的敌人——帝国主义，特别是美国帝国主义正在热中地为阿联当局的这些违背阿拉伯人民意愿的做法喝彩，合众国际社发自开罗的电讯说：“西方突然发现它站在纳赛尔一边”；而“长期以来在这里被称为帝国主义敌人的西方，几乎成为被人遗忘的目标”。
    事实表明，帝国主义对于伊拉克人民革命的胜利是绝不甘心的。不久前，美国与“巴格达条约”残余成员国土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦分别签订了双边军事协定。美国帝国主义一方面仍然企图利用土耳其和伊朗来威胁伊拉克的和平与安全；另一方面正在加紧玩弄其利用阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人的阴谋。3月24日的美国“新闻周刊”还在“预言”，所谓“亲纳赛尔分子”“可能在今后两个星期内又一次企图推翻伊拉克政府。”
    但是，可以断言，帝国主义和外国干涉势力的一切颠复阴谋都将失败，团结一致的、得到全世界和平力量强大支持的英勇的伊拉克人民，将沿着胜利的道路继续前进！
