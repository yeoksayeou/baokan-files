Western European Economic Turmoil:
American Capital Takes Advantage of the Situation

(Reported by our newspaper) While Western European countries are engaged in an economic and trade melee over the "Coal and Steel Community" and the "Common Market," American capital is seizing the opportunity to intensify its penetration into the "Common Market," establishing factories locally to plunder local resources and exploit Western Europe's cheap labor.

Not long ago, the American "Chrysler Corporation" acquired 25% of the shares of the French "Simca Automobile Company." "Westinghouse International Electric Company" and a group of French steel enterprises jointly formed "Framatome," preparing to jointly build a nuclear power plant. The American automotive parts manufacturer "Budd Company" has established a branch in France called "Budd-Fauvel."

In Belgium, the American "Procter & Gamble Company" will build a factory in Mechelen. "DuPont" plans to build a pigment factory in Mechelen.

In the Netherlands, the American "Chrysler Corporation" acquired several factories of the Dutch "Kaiser-Frazer Automotive Company." The American "Canadian Goodrich Rubber Co., Ltd." and A.K.U. will build a synthetic rubber plant in Arnhem. "DuPont" is also preparing to build an "Orlon plant" in the Netherlands.

However, the West German market, with its enormous industrial potential and cheap labor, has become the main target of American capital. In 1958, the American "Smith Corona Typewriter Company" of California acquired control of Berlin's "Hamann Computer Company." "American Container Corporation" established "Hamburg Europe Paperboard Co., Ltd." in West Germany, controlling "Bremen Pulp Manufacturing Co., Ltd." Recently, American private capital has begun to massively invade West Germany in order to control the entire Western European market from within the "Common Market."

According to recent news from the British "Manchester Guardian," the large-scale purchase of stocks in West Germany by American private capital in early April has caused a sharp rise in stock prices. According to German financial reporters, the scale is unprecedented since 1931.

According to the newspaper, the targets of American capital are mainly concentrated in West Germany's heavy industrial sectors such as chemicals, electricity, and steel. In the words of the newspaper, they are "concentrated on the stocks of nine companies. They are the three 'successor companies' of the former IG Farben Trust (Bayer, BASF, and Hoechst), two electrical companies (AEG and Siemens), the Rhine United Steel Plant, and the 'Big Three' commercial banks (Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, and Commerzbank)."

The report also stated that West German financial reporters believe that American interest will expand after the visit of forty members of the New York Society of Security Analysts to West Germany in mid-April. At the same time, several American investment trusts are considering establishing a "European Fund" in West Germany to expand investment in Western Europe.

The American "Business Week" also reported on the "rush" of American capital into Western Europe. The magazine said that in Western Europe, American companies are not only competing with each other for territory, but also competing with European companies, aiming to "maintain or expand their market territory, or to find new markets." The magazine said, "This often allows American companies to overcome tariffs and currency barriers that prevent the import of American goods."

The British "Economist" magazine also reported on the recent intensified invasion of Western Europe by American capital. The magazine said: "Since the 'Common Market' has become an economic reality, more and more American companies are rushing to establish themselves in Europe. The decisive factor for the inflow of American capital into Europe is the cheaper labor force in European countries than in the United States. American factories in Europe can supply products to the United States at prices much lower than products manufactured in the United States. The difference averages 10%–15%, and in some cases reaches 30%–40%."

The magazine also said that a group of American economic experts plans to stay in West Germany for six weeks to study the possibility of expanding American connections with West German business circles. Another group of American financial experts will visit Britain, France, Italy, West Germany, and the Netherlands for the same purpose. The magazine also said that more than one hundred American companies have now established their headquarters in Switzerland to lead the activities of entering the "Common Market." Moreover, the number of American companies participating in this activity is increasing, which has caused great anxiety in Switzerland.

Since 1950, with the rise of national independence movements in overseas colonial countries, American private foreign investment, for the sake of "security," has turned to Western Europe. For example, from 1950 to 1957, American private foreign investment increased by only 15%, but investment in Western Europe increased by 135%. This time, the establishment of the "Common Market" has further promoted the invasion of American capital. (Attached picture)

    西欧经济混战一团
    美国资本乘虚而入
    本报讯　当西欧各国围绕着“煤钢联营”和“共同市场”问题正在展开经济和贸易大混战的时候，美国资本却趁机加紧向西欧“共同市场”内部渗透，实行就地办厂来掠夺当地资源并剥削西欧的廉价劳动力。
    不久前，美国“克莱斯勒汽车公司”收买了法国“西姆卡汽车公司”25％的股票。“威斯汀豪斯国际电气公司”和法国钢铁企业的一个集团联合组成“弗罗马托姆公司”，准备共同修建一个原子能工厂。美国一家制造汽车零件的“布德公司”则在法国创建了一个分公司“布法尔公司”。
    在比利时，美国的“普罗忒甘贝尔公司”将在马利尼斯建立一座工厂。“杜邦公司”则打算在马利尼斯建立一座颜料厂。
    在荷兰，美国“克莱斯勒汽车公司”收买了荷兰“凯撒—福拉赛汽车公司”的几家工厂。美国“加拿大固特立橡胶有限公司”和A·K·U公司将在安亨建设一座人造橡胶厂。“杜邦公司”也准备在荷兰建立一座“奥伦丝工厂”。
    不过成为美国资本主要进攻目标的则是具有巨大工业潜力和廉价劳动力的西德市场。1958年美国加利福尼亚州的“史密斯—科罗纳打字公司”收买了柏林“汉曼计算机公司”的控制权。“美利坚容器公司”在西德设立“汉堡欧洲纸板有限公司”，控制了“不来梅纸浆制造有限公司”。最近，美国私人资本更开始大举向西德入侵，以便从
  “共同市场”内部来控制整个西欧市场。
    根据英国“曼彻斯特卫报”最近的消息，美国私人资本4月初在西德大批收买股票的结果已引起了股票牌价的激烈上涨。据德国金融记者说，其规模为1931年以来所从未发生过的现象。
    根据这家杂志的报道，美国资本的进攻对象主要集中在西德的化学、电气、钢铁等重工业部门。用这家杂志的话来说，就是“一直集中在九家公司的股票上。它们是前法本托辣斯的三家‘继承公司’（拜耳、巴登苯胺苏打厂和赫希斯特染料公司），两家电气公司（德国电气总公司和西门子电工器材公司），莱因联合钢铁厂和‘三大’商业公司（德意志银行、德累斯顿银行和商业银行）”。
    该报并说，西德金融记者认为，在4月中旬纽约证券分析家协会的四十个成员访问西德以后，美国的兴趣将会扩大。同时，若干美国投资托辣斯并考虑在西德成立某种“欧洲基金”，以扩大对西欧的投资。
    美国“商业周刊”也报道了美国资本向西欧“一涌而入”的情况。这家周刊说，在西欧，美国公司不仅彼此在互相争夺地盘，而且也在同欧洲公司争夺地盘，其目的在于“保持或扩大它们的市场地盘，或者去寻找新的市场。”这家杂志说：“这样就时常使美国公司能够越过不让美国货进口的关税和货币壁垒”。
    英国“统计学家”杂志也不约而同地报道了美国资本最近加紧向西欧入侵的情况。这家杂志说：“自从‘共同市场’成为经济现实以来，越来越多的美国公司争先恐后地在欧洲扎根。而使美国资本流入欧洲的决定性因素则是欧洲各国有着比美国廉价的劳动力。美国在欧洲的工厂可以按比在美国制造的产品低很多的价格把产品供应给美国。这个差别平均在10％—15％，而在有些情况下则达到30％—40％”。
    这家杂志还说，目前已有一批美国经济专家打算到西德逗留六个星期以便研究扩大美国同西德实业界联系的可能性。另外一批美国财政专家则将访问英国、法国、意大利、西德和荷兰，也是为了这个目的。这家杂志并说，为了领导打入
  “共同市场”的活动，现在已有一百多家美国公司在瑞士安下了大本营。而且目前参加这种活动的美国公司越来越多，已引起了瑞士的极大不安。
    从1950年起，在海外各殖民地国家民族独立运动风起云涌下，美国私人对外投资为“安全”计，曾纷纷转向西欧。例如从1950年到1957年，美国私人对外投资只增加了15％，但对西欧的投资就增加了135％。这次由于西欧成立“共同市场”，更加促进了美国资本的入侵。（附图片）
