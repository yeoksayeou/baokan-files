　　Shameful Plunder Behind Beautiful Promises
　　Li Qiao
    New Plunder Plan
    The de Gaulle government is playing a double game in Algeria. On the one hand, it continues and intensifies its barbaric military suppression, and on the other hand, it announces a set of reformist plans to deceive and confuse the Algerian people. Last October, the de Gaulle government announced the so-called "Five-Year Socio-Economic Plan" for Algeria—the Constantine Plan, which piled up a lot of beautiful promises, is such a thing.

    How tempting this plan is! It promises to distribute 250,000 hectares of land to Muslim farmers; reserve 10% of French government positions for Algerian youth; equalize Algerian wages with those in mainland France; implement an industrial and agricultural development plan; regularly employ 400,000 new workers; build one million new homes; and ensure that two-thirds of Algerian children have access to education within five years, and strive to ensure that all school-age children can receive education within eight years, and so on.

    Since it is a barbaric military conquest, denying that Algeria is a country, denying that the Algerian people have any independent sovereignty, and even obliterating the Algerian nation and language; isn't this in itself the best exposure of the thoroughly colonialist attempt of this beautiful plan? Not only that, but the Constantine Plan alone cannot conceal the French colonialists' shameful plunder.

    This is not a unique plan. In the dozen years since the war, French colonialists have put forward various plans that are largely the same. For example, as early as 1946, France announced the "Algerian Industrialization Plan." At that time, it was also touted as a major measure to develop Algeria's economy and improve people's living standards. In the past three years or so, there have been even more plans for the so-called development of Algeria. However, each plan meant more frantic plunder and deeper disasters for the Algerian people. This new Constantine Plan is no exception, and it exudes the soaring stench of French monopoly capital further plundering the Sahara oil and other natural resources.

    Unconcealable Lies
    Algeria has extremely rich natural resources. No matter how eloquently the French colonialists boast about their "civilizing mission" in Algeria, they cannot conceal the fact that their "development" plans, one after another, are to plunder Algeria's resources and exploit the Algerian people. The fertile Tell region of northern Algeria has abundant vineyards, wheat fields, citrus plantations, and endless cork forests. The reeds produced on the grasslands are a specialty of Algeria. Various mineral treasures are found throughout the country. In Constantine and Oran provinces, there are high-content iron, sulfur, lead, and zinc mines. In the Ouargla region in the south, there are tin and uranium mines. Near the Moroccan border in Guettara, there are manganese mines, and in Akjoujt in the southwest, there are copper mines. The two oil centers of the Algerian Sahara, Hassi Messaoud and Edjeleh, have now become world-famous oil-producing areas.

    However, Algeria's resources are completely controlled by local large colonists and French monopoly capital. The large colonists mainly suck a large amount of wealth from Algeria's agricultural production, especially the grape growing industry. French financial capital not only owns a large amount of real estate in Algeria and operates some agricultural products, but also directly controls all minerals, energy (petroleum products), public works industries, processing industries, commerce, and transportation. Twenty-three colonial companies increased their profits by 6,117 million francs in the six years from 1947 to 1953. The Paris-Mirabeau United Bank plays an important role in many financial capital groups. It controls many companies through the "Algerian Company".

    French colonialists adopted primitive and barbaric exploitation methods, making Algeria a market for French industrial products and a supply base for raw materials and agricultural products.

    Before 1830, Algeria was an independent country, and Algeria's agriculture was quite developed at that time, and it could also export grain. But one hundred and thirty years later, Algeria needs to import grain instead. In the past fifty years, Algeria's population has more than doubled, but grain resources have hardly increased. Grain production has decreased by 20%. On the other hand, the development of vineyards in the hands of colonists has been extremely rapid. When the colonists invaded, Algeria's vineyards only occupied 2,000 hectares of land, but at present, vineyards have occupied 400,000 hectares of arable land, an increase of two hundred times compared to the beginning. Colonists are keen on growing grapes because grapes can bring them great profits. Generally, the income from one hectare of dry land grain is 15,000 francs, while the output value of one hectare of vineyard is ten times higher.

    Algeria's basic industrial sectors are still very underdeveloped. Colonists only develop military industries and produce export raw materials here. There are very few processing industries in Algeria. The various minerals extracted are directly transported to France or other countries. In recent years, French monopoly capital groups have stepped up their plunder of oil in the Sahara region. It is estimated that the oil reserves here are 1 billion tons, which is about one-sixth of the total oil reserves in the capitalist world. France plans to invest 135.5 billion francs this year in an attempt to plunder 1.7 million tons of oil from here this year, 8.7 million tons next year, and reach 20 million tons per year by 1963.

    The "Achievements" of the "Civilizing Envoys"
    The plunder of the French colonialists has caused widespread hunger, poverty, disease, and displacement among the Algerian people. Five hundred thousand Algerians have fled abroad, 1.5 million people are wandering around, and 400,000 people have gone to France to make a living. The number of unemployed people in Algeria now exceeds 1.5 million. According to official French materials, the average per capita national income in France is 300,000 francs, while in Algeria it is only 70,000 francs. There are also 6 million farmers in Algeria whose annual income is less than 20,000 francs. The wages of Algerian workers are far lower than those of French workers. As for the wages of rural laborers, Algeria is less than half of France. For example, the daily wage of rural laborers in France ranges from 880 to 968 francs for eight hours of work; in Algeria, it ranges from 482 to 574 francs, with daily work exceeding twelve hours, and in fact, the wages earned by laborers are far lower than this official regulation. If the French minimum wage standard is applied to Algeria, then the colonists and business owners would have to increase their expenditures by 60 billion francs each year. How could the de Gaulle government and the insatiable colonists have such "generosity"? De Gaulle's promise to raise Algeria's wage levels can only remain on paper forever.

    Judging from the current living conditions of the Algerian people, what miracle will De Gaulle's plan to build one million new homes for them create? In Algeria, many luxurious houses and towering buildings have indeed been built, but the vast majority of Algerians live in shacks made of wood and iron sheets. As for the farmers, they can only crowd into small "thatched packages" without windows. Such living conditions, coupled with poverty, disease, and malnutrition, make the health of Algerian residents shockingly bad. Throughout Algeria, there is an average of one doctor for every 10,000, 30,000, or even 80,000 people, and even fewer in some places. It is estimated that there are about 400,000 people suffering from lung disease in Algeria, and 50% of children die before the age of five. More than half of Algerians have an average life expectancy of less than twenty years, and those over sixty years old account for only 5.1%.

    The mission of France's "civilizing envoys" is to keep Algerians ignorant. The head of the French Business Owners' Union once publicly stated that "Algerians must be kept ignorant." Children have almost no opportunity to study, and 85% of Algerians are illiterate, while before the French invasion, the literacy level of the Algerian people was no lower than that of France and Italy at that time. French colonialists tried their best to isolate Algeria from culture. Algerian history has been completely distorted, Arabic has been declared a foreign language, and French, which has nothing to do with the vast majority of Algerians, has been declared the only official language.

    In order to ensure their economic plunder of Algeria, French colonialists gradually established a colonial rule system in Algeria after the invasion. From a formal point of view, Algeria also has municipal committees, but the vast majority of councilors are Europeans, and all mayors are Europeans. Most Algerians live in rural areas and are deeply oppressed by the violence and cruelty of semi-military and semi-feudal administrative organs. To this day, tens of thousands of Algerian patriots are still imprisoned in one hundred and seventy-one concentration camps, suffering inhumane persecution. In recent years, the colonialists have promoted the notorious "pacification-election-negotiation" policy in Algeria. The "election" farce in November last year, which raped public opinion, was one manifestation of this policy. Before the election, the colonialists arrested and killed a large number of peaceful residents who refused to "cooperate"; during the election, they dispatched 600,000 colonial troops to coerce the people to vote for their designated candidates with bayonets. This is how the Algerian people live a life of oppression and enslavement.

    Colonial Plans Will Inevitably Go Bankrupt
    This is the result of the French colonialists implementing various plans in Algeria. De Gaulle's plan to merge and "develop" Algeria is nothing more than a more arrogant plan to maintain the crumbling dark colonial prison and safeguard the plunder of the large colonists and financial oligarchs.

    The radio station of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic, "The Voice of the Algerian Republic," forcefully exposed and refuted this plan, saying: "How can we talk about Algeria's economic development when Algeria's profits are plundered by French banks and Algerian laborers work under the surveillance of colonial troops and gendarmes? What equality can be talked about when an occupying army of 600,000 people is stationed on our land! De Gaulle's words are deceiving the Algerian people. These promises are disastrous and will bring death and poverty."

    The Algerian people have stood up to end the history of more than a hundred years of humiliating disasters forever. The Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic solemnly announced in a communique: "For France, the only question in Algeria is to end the war of colonial conquest... This is a question of respecting the will of the Algerian people and recognizing Algeria's independence." Bloody bayonets, beautiful promises, and lies, everything cannot stop the Algerian people from moving forward and cannot save the bankruptcy of French colonialism.

　　在美丽诺言背后的可耻掠夺
　　李樵
    新的掠夺计划
    戴高乐政府在阿尔及利亚正玩弄着两面手法。它一面继续和加紧进行野蛮的军事镇压，一面则宣布一套改良主义的计划，用以欺骗和迷惑阿尔及利亚人民。去年10月，戴高乐政府宣布的所谓阿尔及利亚“社会经济五年计划”——堆了一大串美丽的诺言的君士坦丁计划，就是这样一个东西。
    这个计划是多么诱人呀，说要把二十五万公顷土地分配给穆斯林农民；把法国政府中的职位保留10％给阿尔及利亚青年；把阿尔及利亚的工资和法国本土拉平；实现一种工农业开发计划；经常雇用四十万新工人；建筑一百万所新住宅；五年内使三分之二的阿尔及利亚儿童有入学的机会，并争取八年内使全部学龄儿童都能受到教育等等。
    既然是野蛮的军事征伐，不承认阿尔及利亚是一个国家，不承认阿尔及利亚人民有任何的独立主权，甚至阿尔及利亚的民族和文字都被抹煞了；那末，这本身不就是对这个美丽计划的彻头彻尾的殖民主义企图的最好暴露吗？不仅如此，单以君士坦丁计划来说，也丝毫掩盖不了法国殖民主义可耻的掠夺行为。
    这不是独一无二的计划，战后十几年来法国殖民者不知多少次提出过大同小异的各样计划。譬如，早在1946年，法国就宣布过“阿尔及利亚工业化计划”。当时也曾把它吹嘘成是发展阿尔及利亚经济和提高人民生活水平的重大措施。近三年多来，所谓开发阿尔及利亚的计划，更是名目繁多。但是，一个计划比一个计划意味着更疯狂的掠夺和对阿尔及利亚人民更深重的灾难。这次新的君士坦丁计划，也不例外，而且散发着法国垄断资本进一步掠夺撒哈拉石油和其他自然资源的冲天臭味。
    掩饰不住的谎言
    阿尔及利亚有着极为富饶的自然资源。不管法国殖民者如何天花乱坠地吹嘘他们在阿尔及利亚的“文明使命”，但是无论如何也掩饰不住，他们一个接着一个的“开发”计划，是为了要掠夺阿尔及利亚的资源和剥削阿尔及利亚人民。阿尔及利亚北部的肥沃的特勒区，有着产量丰富的葡萄园、小麦产地、柑橘种植园和一望无际的软木林，草原上出产的芦苇更是阿尔及利亚的特产。各种矿产宝藏遍布全国。在君士坦丁和阿兰省埋藏有含量很高的铁矿、硫磺、铅和锌，南部奥加地区有锡、铀矿，靠近摩洛哥边境的古埃塔拉有锰矿，西南部阿克如特有铜矿。阿尔及利亚撒哈拉两个石油中心哈西迈赛乌德和埃杰莱，现在已经成为世界闻名的石油产地了。
    但是，阿尔及利亚的富源，完全被当地的大殖民者和法国本土的垄断资本所控制着。大殖民者主要是从阿尔及利亚农业生产特别是葡萄种植业中吮吸着大量财富。法国的金融资本则不仅在阿尔及利亚拥有大量地产，经营一部分农产品，还直接控制着全部矿产、动力（石油产品）、公共工程工业、加工工业、商业和交通运输。二十三家殖民公司，从1947到1953年六年中，他们的利润增加了六十一亿一千七百万法郎。在许多金融资本集团中起重要作用的是巴黎—米拉波联合银行，它通过“阿尔及利亚公司”又控制着许多公司。
    法国殖民者采取原始的野蛮的剥削方式，使阿尔及利亚成为法国工业品销售和原料农产品供应的市场。
    1830年以前，阿尔及利亚是一个独立的国家，那时阿尔及利亚的农业曾相当发达，还能输出粮食。但一百三十年以后的今天，阿尔及利亚反而需要输入粮食。近五十年，阿尔及利亚的人口增长了一倍多，但是粮食资源几乎没有增加。谷物的生产反而减少了20％。另方面殖民者手中的葡萄园的发展却极为迅速。殖民者入侵时，阿尔及利亚的葡萄园当时只占用两千公顷土地，而目前，葡萄园已经占用了四十万公顷良田，所占土地比当初增加了二百倍。殖民者热中于种植葡萄，是因为葡萄可以给他们带来莫大利润，一般一公顷旱地谷物的收入是一万五千法郎，而一公顷葡萄园的产值则高出十倍的价值。
    阿尔及利亚的基本工业部门至今还很不发达。殖民者在这里只发展军事工业和生产出口原料。阿尔及利亚的加工工业很少，开采出来的各种矿物都直接运往法国或其它国家。近年来法国垄断资本集团加紧掠夺撒哈拉地区内的石油。据估计这里的石油储藏量有十亿吨，约等于资本主义世界石油储藏总量的六分之一。法国今年准备投资一千三百五十五亿法郎，企图年内从这里掠夺一百七十万吨石油，明年八百七十万吨，到1963年时将达到每年二千万吨。
    “文明使者”的“功绩”
    法国殖民者的掠夺，造成了广大阿尔及利亚人民饥饿、贫病、流离失所。阿尔及利亚有五十万人逃亡在外，一百五十万人到处流浪，四十万人到法国去谋生。 现在阿尔及利亚的失业人数已超过一百五十万人。据法国官方公布的材料，法国国民收入每人平均是三十万法郎，阿尔及利亚只有七万法郎，阿尔及利亚还有六百万农民每年收入不到两万法郎。阿尔及利亚工人的工资远低于法国工人的工资，至于农村雇工的工资，阿尔及利亚不及法国的一半。如农村雇工每日工资，法国是从八百八十到九百六十八法郎，工作八小时；在阿尔及利亚是从四百八十二到五百七十四法郎，每日工作在十二小时以上，而实际上雇工所得的工资还要远远低于这个官方的规定。如果把法国最低工资标准适用到阿尔及利亚，那么殖民者和企业主每年要增加支出六百亿法郎，戴高乐政府和贪得无餍的殖民者哪有这样的“慷慨”。戴高乐的提高阿尔及利亚工资水平的诺言，也只能永远留在口头上。
    根据目前阿尔及利亚人民的居住条件来看，戴高乐要为他们建造一百万所新住宅的计划，又会出现什么奇迹呢？在阿尔及利亚确实已经建筑了不少的豪华住宅、巍然耸立的大厦，但绝大多数阿尔及利亚人都是住在用木板和铁皮造成的棚屋里。至于农民，更只能拥挤在一个个狭小的根本没有窗户的“茅草包”里。这样的居住条件，加上贫病和营养不良，阿尔及利亚居民的健康状况坏得惊人。在阿尔及利亚各地，平均一万、三万，甚至八万人才有一个医生，有些地方还要更少些。据估计阿尔及利亚肺病患者约有四十万人左右，有50％的孩子未满五岁就死掉了。阿尔及利亚人有一半以上平均寿命不到二十岁，六十岁以上的人只占5.1％。
    法国的“文明使者”的使命就是使阿尔及利亚人愚昧无知。法国企业主联盟负责人曾公开讲过“要阿尔及利亚人愚昧”的话。儿童几乎没有读书的机会，阿尔及利亚人民有85％是文盲，而在法国入侵前，阿尔及利亚人民的识字水平并不低于当时的法国和意大利。法国殖民者想尽一切办法使阿尔及利亚脱离文化。阿尔及利亚的历史完全被歪曲，阿拉伯语被宣布为是外国语，根本与绝大多数阿尔及利亚人无关的法语，却被宣布为唯一正式的语言。
    法国殖民者为了确保他们对阿尔及利亚的经济上的掠夺，自入侵后，就逐渐在阿尔及利亚建立起一套殖民统治制度。从形式上看来，阿尔及利亚也设有市政委员会，但是绝大多数议员都是欧洲人，所有的市长都是欧洲人。大部分阿尔及利亚人都住在农村，深受半军事、半封建行政机构的暴力和残酷的压迫。至今，阿尔及利亚成千上万的爱国者仍被禁锢在一百七十一座集中营里倍受惨绝人寰的迫害。近年来，殖民者在阿尔及利亚推行臭名远扬的“绥靖——选举——谈判”政策。去年11月强奸民意的“选举”丑剧，便是这种政策的表现之一。选举前殖民者大批逮捕和杀害拒绝“合作”的和平居民；选举时，派遣六十万殖民大军用刺刀胁迫人民去投他们钦定的候选人的票。阿尔及利亚人民就是这样过着被压迫被奴役的生活。
    殖民计划必将破产
    这就是法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚实行各种各样的计划的结果。戴高乐的合并和“开发”阿尔及利亚的计划，不过是为了保持摇摇欲坠的黑暗的殖民牢狱、维护大殖民者和金融寡头的掠夺的一种更狂妄的计划。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的电台“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”有力地揭穿和驳斥了这项计划，电台说：“当阿尔及利亚的利润都为法国银行所掠夺和阿尔及利亚劳动者在殖民军队和宪兵的监视下劳动，又如何能谈什么阿尔及利亚的经济发展呢？当一支六十万人的占领军正驻在我们的国土上，又有什么平等可谈呢！戴高乐的话是欺骗阿尔及利亚人的。这些许诺是灾难性的，将会带来死亡和贫困。”
    阿尔及利亚人民已经站了起来，要永远结束一百多年屈辱的灾难的历史。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府在一项公报中郑重宣布：“对于法国来说，在阿尔及利亚的唯一问题就是结束进行殖民征服的战争……这是一个尊重阿尔及利亚人民的意志和承认阿尔及利亚独立的问题。”血淋淋的刺刀，美丽的许诺和谎言，一切的一切，都阻挡不了阿尔及利亚人民的前进，挽救不了法国殖民主义者的破产。
