Renmin University of China is vigorously strengthening the teaching of political theory courses.

Since the beginning of this semester, the leadership of Renmin University of China has attached great importance to the teaching of theoretical courses, strengthened the teaching force, and assigned relatively strong teachers to lecture. In light of the specific situation of having many courses and few teachers, they adopted the method of large-class lectures and group tutoring to solve the difficulty of insufficient teaching staff. Many members of the Party Committee and branch secretaries personally participated in the teaching of political theory. Hu Xikui, Secretary of the Party Committee, in addition to attending classes and inspecting teaching quality, is also scheduled to lecture on some topics in the philosophy course. Nie Zhen, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, also lectures on some topics in the course "Socialism and Communism Education." Some branch committee members also serve as leaders of the theoretical teaching groups, inspecting teaching conditions and guiding teachers in preparing lessons. The four political theory departments of the whole school—philosophy, history of the Chinese Communist Party, political economy, and foundations of Marxism-Leninism—all regard the writing and revising of lecture notes as one of the key tasks of their work.

The content of the theoretical courses is richer than before. Last year, most of the teachers and students of the whole school went to factories and rural areas to conduct investigations, which provided rich content for the theoretical courses to integrate with practice. For example, in the course of political economy, the section on socialist economy has been strengthened, explaining some new issues in China's economy, such as the new economic issues raised in the people's commune movement, commodity production, the law of value, distribution according to work, and the two transitions. The teaching has increased the content of criticizing bourgeois erroneous views in order to strengthen the theoretical combat effectiveness of this course. On the basis of close integration with practice, some new courses have also been opened. Among them are the Party History Department's "Mao Zedong on the Chinese Revolution and Construction" and the Marxism-Leninism Fundamentals Department's "History of the International Communist Movement" and "Socialism and Communism."

In the teaching of various theoretical courses this semester, the method of combining teacher lectures with student self-study and open debate is adopted. For example, when the philosophy department taught the chapter "Introduction" to philosophy, they changed the past practice of simply lecturing or vaguely debating what philosophy is. Instead, in the spirit of Chairman Mao's "Reform Our Study," through lectures, open forums, and debates, they clarified that studying philosophy is to serve politics and production, and that it is necessary to integrate theory with practice and establish correct positions and methods of understanding in order to truly learn philosophy well. This has better solved the problems of attitude and method in studying philosophy.

While strengthening theoretical courses, Renmin University of China has included current affairs and policy education as a basic course in the teaching plan, under the direct leadership of the Party Committee. Not long after the start of the semester, President Wu Yuzhang gave a report to the whole school on the domestic situation and the main tasks of the school, and Comrade Nie Zhen, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, also gave a report on the analysis of the situation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the tasks for 1959.

Teachers and students have great enthusiasm for teaching and learning political theory courses. Whether old or young teachers, they prepare lessons more carefully than before. In teachers' lesson preparation, attention is paid to giving play to collective strength. Many teachers' lecture drafts are collectively discussed and revised before lecturing and tutoring. Many teachers who are lecturing pay more attention to going deeper into departments, classes, and student dormitories to understand students' learning conditions, and pay attention to solving students' ideological problems in their lectures. The students are also very enthusiastic in their studies. When students in the agricultural economics specialty course studied philosophy, they raised various questions in the discussions during the first two units of study, which focused on "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." When studying "On Practice," many students examined their own subjective idealist thinking methods, and the discussions were very lively, even arguing while eating and walking. The students believe that learning theoretical courses in this way is very good, and it has indeed improved their theoretical level and ability to think about problems, and can achieve the purpose of learning for application.

    联系实际  学习理论  提高认识
    中国人民大学加强政治理论课教学工作
    本报讯　中国人民大学大力加强政治理论课的教学。
    这学期开学后，中国人民大学领导上很重视理论课的教学工作，加强了教学力量，较强的教师都担任了讲授工作。并根据课多人少的具体情况，采用大课讲授、集体辅导的作法，解决教师力量不足的困难。党委委员和总支书记多人都亲自参加政治理论教学工作。党委书记胡锡奎除了听课，检查教学质量外，还预定担任哲学课中一些专题的讲授。党委副书记聂真也担任社会主义与共产主义教育课中一些专题的讲授。有的总支委员兼任理论教学小组组长，检查教学情况，指导教师备课。全校哲学、中共党史、政治经济学、马列主义基础等四个政治理论系都把编写、修改讲义作为自己工作的重点之一。
    理论课的内容比以往更加丰富，去年全校大部分师生都下厂下乡进行调查工作，为理论课联系实际提供了丰富的内容。如政治经济学一课中，就加强了社会主义经济部分，分别阐述了我国经济方面的一些新问题，如人民公社运动中提出的经济方面的新问题，商品生产、价值规律、按劳分配以及两个过渡等方面的问题。在教学中增加了批判资产阶级错误观点的内容，以加强这一课程中理论上的战斗性。在密切联系实际的基础上，也开出了一些新课。其中有党史系的“毛泽东论中国革命和建设”，马列主义基础系的“国际共产主义运动史”、“社会主义与共产主义”等。
    各门理论课的教学，这学期都采用了教师讲授和学生自学鸣放辩论相结合的方法。如哲学系在教哲学“序论”这一章时，改变了过去单纯地讲授或者空泛地辩论什么是哲学等做法，而是以毛主席的“改造我们的学习”一文的精神，通过讲授、鸣放、辩论明确了学哲学是为政治、生产服务，必须理论联系实际，树立正确的立场和认识方法，才能真正学好哲学。这样就较好地解决了学哲学的态度和方法问题。
    在加强理论课的同时，中国人民大学把时事政策教育作为基本课程，纳入教学计划，由党委直接领导。开学不久，校长吴玉章就向全校作了国内形势和学校主要任务的报告，党委副书记聂真同志也作了关于1958年大跃进形势的分析和1959年的任务的报告。
    教师、学生对政治理论课的教和学劲头都很大。无论老教师或者年青教师都比以往更加仔细地备课。在教师备课中注意了发挥集体力量，许多教师在进行讲授和辅导之前，讲稿都经过集体讨论和修改。许多担任讲课的教师注意了更多地深入系、班和学生宿舍了解学生学习情况，在讲课中注意解决学生思想问题。学生们学习的劲头也很大，农经系专修科的学生学哲学时，在以“实践论”“矛盾论”为中心的头二个单元的学习中，在讨论中，提出了各式各样问题。在学习“实践论”时，许多学生都检查了自己的主观主义的思想方法，讨论非常热烈，甚至在吃饭走路时也都在争论。学生们认为这样学习理论课很好，确实提高了理论水平和思考问题的能力，能达到学以致用的目的。
