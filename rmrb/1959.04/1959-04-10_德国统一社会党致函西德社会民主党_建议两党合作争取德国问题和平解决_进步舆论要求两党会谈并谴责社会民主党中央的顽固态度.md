Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to reports, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, in a letter to the Central Council of the West German Social Democratic Party and to all party organizations and members of the Social Democratic Party, put forward four suggestions on the actions of the two parties in peacefully resolving the German question:

    1. The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party and the Central Council of the Social Democratic Party should hold a meeting to jointly discuss the issues of opposing German militarism, striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty, and reunifying Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country.

    2. The party organizations of the Social Democratic Party and the Socialist Unity Party should work to ensure that the issue of a peace treaty with Germany is discussed in all organizations of the Bundestag and the People's Chamber, and that decisions are made against West German atomic armament, militaristic, anti-Semitic, and revanchist activities.

    3. The two parties urge their members in trade unions, sports, youth, and women's organizations to express their attitude in the same spirit.

    4. The two parties support the proposal to launch a mass movement against atomic armament and the establishment of missile bases. The two parties support the establishment of peace defense committees.

    The letter from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany was delivered to the Central Council of the West German Social Democratic Party on April 3rd. "Neues Deutschland" published the full text of the letter on the 5th.

    In the letter, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany welcomed the suggestions made by the Central Council of the Social Democratic Party on March 19 regarding the conclusion of a peace treaty and the reunification of Germany, namely the "German Plan."

    The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party stated in the letter that the most important conclusion drawn from the "German Plan" of the West German Social Democratic Party is that a normal relationship must first be established between the two parties and among all German workers' organizations. The letter stated that the suggestions of the Social Democratic Party are consistent with the views of the Socialist Unity Party in many respects, and there are realistic conditions for reaching the necessary agreements. Therefore, now is the time for the two parties to sit down together at a table.

    The letter then analyzed some of the same and different views of the Socialist Unity Party and the Social Democratic Party.

    The letter concluded by stating that the Socialist Unity Party advocates joint action with all workers in West Germany, especially Social Democrats, trade union members, and Christian working people. The letter also said that the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party is willing to hold talks with representatives of the Central Council of the Social Democratic Party at any time.

    After the publication of this letter, it immediately caused a great reaction in public opinion and among the masses in the German Democratic Republic and West Germany.

    Progressive public opinion, the masses, and some Social Democratic Party members warmly welcomed the letter from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and condemned the attitude expressed by the Presidium of the West German Social Democratic Party on the 6th, which refused to hold negotiations with the Socialist Unity Party.

      "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial on the 8th saying that the letter from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party to the Executive Committee of the Social Democratic Party is one of the most important documents in the history of the German workers' movement since 1945. The enormous response evoked by this letter demonstrates the important role of the German Democratic Republic as a fortress of peace and the high prestige of the Socialist Unity Party.

    The editorial condemned the attitude of the Presidium of the Social Democratic Party in refusing to hold talks with representatives of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, and considered it to be shortsighted, because the Presidium of the Social Democratic Party cannot prevent the meetings that have begun between members and cadres at all levels of the two parties through such a decision.

    The letter from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to the Social Democratic Party was endorsed by Social Democratic Party members and West German workers at meetings between East and West German workers held in various parts of the German Democratic Republic.

    At a recent symposium of East and West German trade union workers held in Berlin, all trade union workers from West Germany actively supported the proposal of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party to hold talks with the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Party on the issue of opposing German militarism, striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and reunifying Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country. A Social Democratic miner from Dortmund said that the content of the letter from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party to the Social Democratic Party is in line with the interests of the entire German working class. After we return to West Germany, we will try to get our factories and local organizations to discuss this letter.

    Despite the fact that the Presidium of the West German Social Democratic Party rejected the proposal of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party for talks between the two parties on the 6th, the letter from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party to the Social Democratic Party has already caused a great reaction in public opinion in West Germany, and the voices of ordinary Social Democratic Party members demanding contact with the Socialist Unity Party are getting louder and louder.

    According to reports in Berlin's democratic district newspapers, the statement made by some members of the Social Democratic Party Executive Committee that "the Social Democratic Party is not the ruling party and has not been entrusted by Western countries, therefore it cannot negotiate with the Socialist Unity Party" has been criticized by ordinary Social Democratic Party members.

    A Social Democratic Party member in Cologne said:
  "Wouldn't it be better to listen to the mandate of the party members! The mandate of the party members has long been there, and this mandate is negotiation." A Social Democratic Party member in West Berlin said that many party members in our party frankly hope for the rapid realization of cooperation between the two major parties.

    德国统一社会党致函西德社会民主党
    建议两党合作争取德国问题和平解决
    进步舆论要求两党会谈并谴责社会民主党中央的顽固态度
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：德国统一社会党中央在给西德社会民主党中央理事会及社会民主党所有党组织和全体党员的一封信中就两党在和平解决德国问题上的行动提出了四点建议：
    一、统一社会党中央和社会民主党中央召开会议共同讨论反对德国军国主义、争取缔结和约和使德国重新统一为一个爱好和平和民主的国家的斗争问题。
    二、社会民主党和统一社会党的党组织应致力于使对德和约问题在联邦议院和人民议院的一切组织里得到讨论，并作出关于反对西德原子备战和军国主义的、反犹太人的以及复仇主义的各种活动的决定。
    三、两党敦促它们在工会、体育、青年、妇女组织中的党员以同样精神表明态度。
    四、两党支持关于开展反对原子备战和建立火箭基地的群众运动的建议。两党支持建立保卫和平委员会。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会这封信是4月3日交给西德社会民主党中央理事会的。“新德意志报”5日发表了这封信的全文。
    德国统一社会党中央在这封信中对社会民主党中央理事会3月19日所指出的关于缔结和约和重新统一德国的建议，即“德国计划”表示欢迎。
    德国统一社会党中央在信中表示，从西德社会民主党的“德国计划”中得出的最重要的结论，就是两党之间和一切德国工人组织之间，必须首先建立一种正常的关系。信件说，社会民主党的建议在许多方面都与统一社会党的看法一致，并且有现实的条件来达成必要的协议。因此，现在是两党共同坐到一张桌子旁边来的时候了。
    信件接着分析了统一社会党和社会民主党的一些相同的和不同的看法。
    信件最后表示，统一社会党主张和所有西德的工人，首先是社会民主党人、工会会员和信仰基督教的劳动人民，采取联合行动。信件还说，统一社会党中央在任何时候都愿意同社会民主党中央理事会的代表进行会谈。
    这封信发表后，立即在德意志民主共和国和西德的舆论界和群众中引起巨大反应。
    进步舆论、群众和一些社会民主党党员热烈欢迎德国统一社会党这封信并谴责西德社会民主党主席团6日所表示的拒绝同统一社会党举行谈判的态度。
      “新德意志报”8日发表社论说，德国统一社会党中央致社会民主党执行委员会的信是1945年以后德国工人运动历史中的最重要文件之一。这封信所唤起的巨大反响表现了作为和平堡垒的德意志民主共和国重要作用和统一社会党的崇高威信。
    社论谴责了社会民主党主席团拒绝同统一社会党中央的代表举行会谈的态度，并认为这是近视的，因为社会民主党主席团并不能通过这样的决定来阻挠两党党员和各级干部之间所开始进行的会晤。
    德国统一社会党中央给社会民主党的信在德意志民主共和国各地举行的东西德工人会见会上获得了社会民主党党员和西德工人的赞同。
    最近在柏林举行的一次东西德工会工作者座谈会上，所有来自西德的工会工作者都积极支持统一社会党中央同社会民主党中央就反对德国军国主义、争取缔结对德和约和使德国重新统一为一个爱好和平和民主的国家的斗争问题举行会谈的建议。一位来自多特蒙德的社会民主党矿工说，统一社会党中央给社会民主党的这封信的内容符合全德工人阶级的利益。我们在回到西德以后，要设法使我们的工厂和地方组织讨论这封信。
    尽管西德社会民主党主席团6日拒绝了统一社会党中央委员会关于两党会谈的建议，统一社会党中央给社会民主党的信已经在西德的舆论界引起很大的反响，社会民主党的普通党员要求和统一社会党接触的呼声越来越高。
    据柏林民主区报纸报道，一些社会民主党执行委员会委员们所说的“社会民主党不是执政党和没有获得西方国家的委托，因而不能同统一社会党谈判”的说法，受到社会民主党普通党员的抨击。
    科隆一位社会民主党党员说：
  “听一听党员的委托不是更好吗！党员们的委托早就有了，这种委托就是谈判。”西柏林的一位社会民主党党员说，我们党内很多党员很坦率地希望迅速实现两个大党的合作。
