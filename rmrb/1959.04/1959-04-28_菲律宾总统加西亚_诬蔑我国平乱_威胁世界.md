Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, April 26th: Philippine President Garcia, at a press conference held in Saigon on the 25th, repeated his slander against China regarding the Tibetan rebellion. He said that the communist suppression in Tibet is a threat not only to Asia but to the whole world.

This is the second time in three days that Garcia has incited anti-communism and issued a clamor to poison international relations regarding this event, which is purely China's internal affair.

Garcia attacked the principle of peaceful coexistence under the pretext of China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion. He nonsensically claimed that "although communist ideology promotes peaceful coexistence, its practice is the opposite, as can be proven by the actions of communist China in Tibet."

    菲律宾总统加西亚
    诬蔑我国平乱“威胁世界”
    新华社26日讯  西贡消息：菲律宾总统加西亚25日在西贡举行的记者招待会上重复他就西藏叛乱事件对中国的污蔑。他说，共产党在西藏进行的镇压不仅是对亚洲而且是对全世界的威胁。
    这是加西亚三天内第二次就这个纯属中国内政的事件煽动反共和发出毒化国际关系的叫嚣。
    加西亚假借中国平定西藏叛乱攻击和平共处的原则。他胡说什么，“尽管共产主义意识形态宣传和平共处，但是它的实践与此相反，这可以由共产党中国在西藏进行镇压的行动得到证明。”
