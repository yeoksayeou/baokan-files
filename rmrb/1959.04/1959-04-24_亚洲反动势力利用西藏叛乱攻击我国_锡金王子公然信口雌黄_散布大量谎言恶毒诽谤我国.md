Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd dispatch from Tokyo: Sikkim Prince Namgyal, while attending the Asian Buddhist Cultural Conference in Tokyo recently, adopted a hostile attitude towards China and manufactured and disseminated a large number of malicious rumors slandering China regarding the Tibetan rebellion. He also revealed that he had been "seeking aid" in Japan in order to organize a so-called "group to aid the Tibetan people" with the aim of supporting Tibetan rebels.

Respecting religious beliefs and protecting the lives and property of people of all ethnic groups are major policies that the Chinese government has consistently adhered to, and the facts are all there. However, this Sikkim Prince publicly made irresponsible remarks, wantonly fabricating rumors and slanders, saying that the Chinese Communist Party in Tibet "plundered the property of religious institutions and destroyed Buddhist rules"; "even women and children were not spared." He also said that "the Khampa people particularly hate the Chinese" because "every family has wives, brothers, or fathers killed by the Communist Chinese."

The Sikkim Prince not only does not conceal his hostility towards China, but also wants to incite other neighboring countries to oppose China. He clamored that China's action to quell the Tibetan rebellion "has made the people of neighboring countries more opposed to China and more anti-communist."

At a time when the Dalai Lama had been abducted by Tibetan rebels and had not yet reached India, the Sikkim Prince said that if the Dalai Lama went to Sikkim to "seek refuge," "Sikkim would warmly welcome him."

In his remarks, the Sikkim Prince repeatedly revealed Sikkim's and India's extraordinary "concern" for China's territory of Tibet.

Given Sikkim's relationship with India, the Sikkim Prince's words and deeds are not surprising. When reporters in Tokyo asked the prince whether he thought China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion was a "threat" to Sikkim, he unreservedly replied: "We are a protectorate of India. If any disputes arise, we will not be alone."

A Reuters dispatch from New Delhi on March 21st also provided a footnote to the prince's attitude. The message read: "Mr. Pant, the Indian representative in Sikkim, maintains close contact with the Sikkim royal family. The royal family and the Tibetan nobles are close relatives."

    亚洲反动势力利用西藏叛乱攻击我国
    锡金王子公然信口雌黄
    散布大量谎言恶毒诽谤我国
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：锡金王子纳姆加耳前不久在东京参加亚洲佛教文化会议时，以敌视中国的态度，就西藏叛乱事件制造和散播了大量恶毒诽谤中国的谣言。他还透露，他曾在日本“寻找援助”，以便组织一个以支持西藏叛乱分子为宗旨的所谓“援助西藏人民的团体”。
    尊重宗教信仰和保护各民族人民生命财产是中国政府一贯坚持执行的重大政策，事实俱在。而这位锡金王子公然信口雌黄，大肆造谣诬蔑，说什么中国共产党在西藏“掠夺了宗教机构的财产，并且破坏了佛教法规”；“甚至连妇女和儿童也不能幸免”。还说什么“康巴人特别痛恨中国人”，因为“每户人家都有妻子、兄弟或者父亲被共产党中国人杀死了”。
    锡金王子不仅不掩饰他对中国的敌视，而且还想煽动其他邻近国家反对中国。他大肆叫嚣，说什么中国平定西藏叛乱的行动“已经使邻近国家的人民更加反对中国和更加反共。
    在当时达赖喇嘛已经被西藏叛乱分子劫持、尚未到达印度的情况下，锡金王子说，如果达赖喇嘛到锡金去“避难”，“锡金将热烈地欢迎他”。
    锡金王子在谈话中还一再流露出锡金和印度对于中国领土西藏异乎寻常的“关心”。
    鉴于锡金同印度的关系，锡金王子的这种言行其实也并不令人感到惊讶。当记者们在东京问到这位王子是否认为中国平定西藏叛乱是对锡金的“威胁”时，他不加掩饰地回答说：“我们是印度的保护领。如果发生任何纠纷的话，我们不会是孤独的。”
    路透社3月21日从新德里发出的一条消息也为这位王子的态度作了注脚。这条消息写道：“印度驻锡金的代表潘特先生和锡金王室保持着密切的联系。王室和西藏的贵族是近亲。”
