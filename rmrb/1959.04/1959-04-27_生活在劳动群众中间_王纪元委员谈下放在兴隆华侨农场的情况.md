Living Among the Working Masses
Wang Jiyuan, Member of the CPPCC National Committee, Discusses His Experience of Working at the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm

Chairman, fellow members, comrades:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Report on the Work of the Government and the reports of other leading comrades, and will implement them in my work.

I was one of the first group of cadres sent to work at the grassroots level. Having recently returned to my original work unit in Beijing from the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm on Hainan Island, after a year of labor training and grassroots work experience, I find listening to Premier Zhou's report particularly sincere, inspiring, and moving. Under the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country are marching with majestic, vigorous, and unified steps towards every corner of the motherland. At the grassroots level, we can hear more clearly the pulse of the motherland and the sound of progress. Every instruction, every word, from the Party and Chairman Mao is the guideline and direction for the actions of the people of the whole country. All aspects of our motherland are flourishing. Every inch of land is constantly undergoing amazing changes. We sing the praises of the great victory of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction!

I would like to take this opportunity to first give you a brief overview of the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm.

**Barren Hills Become a Garden**

The Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm is one of the larger of the nine state-owned Overseas Chinese Farms. It was established in October 1951. The farm has more than 5,000 people, including returned overseas Chinese and their families from Southeast Asia and other places, most of whom were refugees expelled from Malaya by British imperialism. There are many old, weak, women, and children, with only more than 3,000 people having labor power. After returning to the country in batches, they successively joined the ranks of socialist construction in the motherland. Under the correct leadership of the Party, they have brought into play their diligence, courage, perseverance, and pioneering spirit. In just six or seven years, this area, which was originally barren hills, dense forests, overgrown with weeds, and sparsely populated, has become a beautiful socialist garden. More than 30,000 mu of cultivated land is planted with nearly one hundred kinds of tropical and subtropical cash crops, forming distinctive garden areas; they are crop areas, and also garden areas. There are many cash crops that everyone may still be relatively unfamiliar with: coffee, sisal hemp, citronella grass, pepper, rubber, oil palm, cocoa, coconut, betel nut, papaya... It is difficult to list them all here. In short, this is a comprehensive farm that engages in diversified tropical and subtropical cash crops, and simultaneously develops industry, agriculture, forestry, fishing, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations.

The achievements in production are also very significant. Because the returned overseas Chinese originally had rich experience in managing tropical crops, coupled with the superiority of the socialist system in the motherland and the improvement of the ideological consciousness of the returned overseas Chinese after the rectification campaign, the citronella oil produced by the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm has been rated as "the best on the island" in terms of both output and quality and enjoys a good reputation in the international citronella oil market. The coffee produced by the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm is fragrant and mellow. Experts, writers, and journalists from the Soviet Union and various Eastern European democratic countries who have tasted Xinglong coffee praise it endlessly and always want to buy some to take back as precious gifts. Starting this year, coffee production will have a relatively large increase. The farm has had a surplus every year since 1956. In 1958, the total surplus was about 1.5 million yuan, which was used to expand reproduction and enrich various welfare facilities.

The vivid facts of going from nothing to something, from small to large, and from barren hills to a garden, concretely illustrate the truth that labor creates the world.

**Learning from the Working People**

Labor creates the world, and labor also transforms people. The members of the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm came from seventeen overseas residential areas and originally had more than one hundred different social occupations. The individualistic thinking has always been deeply rooted; however, after the Party continuously carried out socialist ideological education among them and organized them to engage in collective labor, the vast majority of them have undergone profound changes in their thinking. Listening to the Party and following the socialist road has become their common creed.

The farm members and employees have great enthusiasm and a spirit of exploration. They work ten hours a day. They have conscious and voluntary labor discipline and are creative in their work. They love cleanliness and enjoy cultural activities. When we cadres who were sent to work at the grassroots level arrived at the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm, what we saw and what we came into contact with were vivid socialist education and class education. From their bodies and hearts, we can learn many excellent qualities. Their spirit of working hard from dawn till dusk, their simple, plain, diligent, honest, and faithful lifestyle and work style, and their full enthusiasm for building socialism make us feel that we are living in a great furnace of the working people, receiving education, training, and testing. Our class feelings are constantly undergoing more profound changes.

The countryside is a sea of knowledge. It has the experience accumulated by our ancestors for thousands of years, and the work experience of our Party for more than 30 years, which is a great learning. However, whether intellectuals can learn something by going to the countryside depends first on whether they have the determination to transform themselves. Is the person in the countryside, and is their heart also in the countryside? Once the determination is there, and the heart is also in the countryside, then the next question is: can they honestly share weal and woe with the masses, engage in labor together, put down the airs of a cadre, and humbly learn from the masses?

Labor is a mirror. Through this mirror, a person's class nature will be clearly revealed. There are three types of people, and three types of labor attitudes. A person with a strong bourgeois ideology and lifestyle will always find it difficult to pick up a hoe or carry a shoulder pole, as if they weigh a thousand pounds, and they cannot dig more than three inches deep into the soil. Their labor attitude is superficial, they sigh in the middle of the night, and they are incompatible with the working masses. A person with a strong petty-bourgeois ideology and lifestyle has a labor attitude that is sometimes hot and sometimes cold, working hard for three days and then lazing around for five. Sometimes they sing loudly, and sometimes they are dejected. A person with the essence of the working people has a labor attitude that is diligent and conscientious, doing their best and working hard, consistently active, and maintaining close contact with the working people at all times and in all places, and humbly learning from them. Only by engaging in labor with the attitude of the working people, and actively doing it consistently, can we learn in the sea of knowledge the rich knowledge of the struggle for production and class struggle that we cannot easily learn from books.

**Passing Five Tests, Cutting Six Vices**

However, no matter what kind of person they are, once they go to the grassroots level and are incorporated into the labor organization, their "three styles" and "five airs", or for intellectuals "three styles" and "six airs" (adding bookishness), will be greatly reduced. The environment has changed, the life has changed, the work has changed, and the degree of change is very large. The eyes of the masses are discerning. They pay attention to the labor attitude, cadre airs, lifestyle details, and the true or false feelings of each cadre sent to work at the grassroots level with sharp eyes and eager expectations. In this way, a cadre sent to work at the grassroots level, especially an intellectual cadre, is gradually prompted to consciously struggle against some of their bad habits and deep-rooted weaknesses.

"Passing five tests" (labor test, life test, organizational test, mass test, learning test) and "cutting six vices" (official airs, extravagant airs, lethargic airs, arrogant airs, pampered airs, bookish airs) is not a simple and easy process, but a detailed, complex, and long-term struggle. Moreover, this test and that test, this vice and that vice are closely related, and it is impossible to plan to pass this test first before passing that test, or to cut off this vice first before cutting off that vice. Only by passing these tests well and cutting off these vices can we transform ourselves into socialist new people with a clear working-class standpoint.

The process of labor, the process of living in the great furnace of the working masses, is a dialectical development process. There are struggles and unity of opposites, there are quantitative changes and qualitative changes, there is the transformation of contradictions, gradually transforming from non-working class to working class. In my deep experience during the period of working at the grassroots level, I feel the correctness and wisdom of the Party's policy of sending cadres to work at the grassroots level.

Except for a very few stubborn people, people can be transformed; but the transformation of people cannot be a Great Leap Forward. Labor can cure all diseases, including ideological diseases. However, only under the leadership of the working-class party—the Communist Party—can people be thoroughly transformed, thereby laying the foundation for ideological construction for the transition from socialism to communism.

Fellow members, comrades: Premier Zhou told us: "Our cause is flourishing in all aspects and is advancing rapidly because our cause is a just cause and is supported by the broad masses of the people." These few words summarize the advancing face of our motherland and the common will of the people of the whole country. We respond to all the calls of the Party and Chairman Mao, unite closely, and march with majestic, vigorous, and unified steps towards the bright road of socialism, to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland—the People's Republic of China!

Finally, I wish all members and comrades good health and the success of the conference!

    生活在劳动群众中间
    王纪元委员谈下放在兴隆华侨农场的情况主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，和其他各位首长的报告，并在工作中贯彻执行。
    我是首批下放的干部之一，最近才从海南岛兴隆华侨农场回到北京原单位工作。经过一年的劳动锻炼和基层工作锻炼以后，来聆听周总理的报告，觉得格外的真切、兴奋、感动。祖国人民在党和毛主席的英明正确领导之下，正以雄伟、壮健、整齐的步伐，向祖国大地的每一个角落进军。在基层，我们更清晰地听到了祖国大地脉搏的跳动和前进的脚步声。党和毛主席的每一个指示，每一句话，都是全国人民行动的准则和奋斗的方向。祖国的各方面都在欣欣向荣。每一寸土地，都在不断地起着惊人的变化。我们歌颂党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利！
    我想趁此机会首先向大家概括地介绍一下国营兴隆华侨农场的情况。
    荒山成为花园
    兴隆华侨农场是九个国营华侨农场中规模比较大的一个。一九五一年十月创办。农场人数共五千多人，是从东南亚和其他各侨居地回国的归侨、侨眷，其中大部分是从马来亚被英帝驱逐回国的难侨。老、弱、妇、孺多，有劳动力的只有三千多人。他们分批回国以后，就陆续参加祖国社会主义建设的行列，在党的正确领导下，发挥了他们的勤劳、勇敢、坚毅、开天辟地的精神。仅仅只有六、七年的时间，这一原来是荒山密林、蔓草丛生、人烟稀少的地区，已经成为社会主义的美丽的大花园。三万多亩已垦地近一百种热带、亚热带经济作物，构成各有特点的园林地带；是作物区，又是花园区，有许多经济作物大家可能还比较生疏的；咖啡、剑麻、香茅、胡椒、橡胶、油棕、可可、椰子、槟榔、木瓜……这里很难一一列举。总之，这是多种经营热带、亚热带经济作物，又是工、农、林、渔、畜牧、副业同时并举的综合性农场。
    生产方面的成绩也是很大的。由于归侨原来就有经营热带作物的丰富经验，再加以祖国社会主义制度的优越性，归侨整风后思想觉悟的提高，兴隆华侨农场出产的香茅油，无论就产量、质量方面，都被评为“全岛之冠”，在国际香茅油市场上，享有很好的声誉。兴隆华侨农场出产的咖啡，芳醇浓郁，喝过兴隆咖啡的苏联和东欧各民主国家的专家、作家、记者，赞不绝口，总要买一些带回去，作为珍贵礼物。自今年起，咖啡产量将有较大量的增加。农场自一九五六年起，每年均有盈余。一九五八年共盈余一百五十万元左右，用于扩大再生产和充实各项福利设施。
    从无到有，从小到大，从荒山变花园的生动事实，具体地说明了劳动创造世界的真理。
    向劳动人民学习
    劳动创造世界，劳动亦改造了人。兴隆华侨农场的成员，来自海外的十七个侨居地，原来有一百多种不同的社会职业，单干思想一向根深蒂固；可是经过了党对他们不断地进行社会主义思想教育，组织他们进行集体劳动以后，他们中间的绝大多数，思想上都起了深刻的变化。听党的话，走社会主义的道路，成为他们的共同的信条。
    场员职工们的干劲很大，钻劲也有。他们每天工作十小时。有自觉自愿的劳动纪律，在工作中有创造性。爱清洁，好文娱。我们下放干部，一到兴隆华侨农场，眼所看到的，行动中所接触的，都是生动的社会主义教育和阶级教育。从他们的身上、心上，我们可以学到许许多多的优良品质。他们那种披星戴月、沐风栉雨的劳动精神，他们那种简单、朴素、勤劳、坦白、忠实的生活作风和工作作风，他们那种充沛的建设社会主义的热情，使我们处处感到自己是生活在劳动人民的大熔炉里，受教育，受锻炼，受考验。自己的阶级感情，不断地起了更深刻的变化。
    农村是知识海。有我们祖先几千年来累积下来的经验，有我们党三十多年来的工作经验，是一门大学问。但是，知识分子下乡，能否学到一些东西，首先要问：有没有改造自己的决心？人在农村，心是不是也在农村？决心有了，心也在农村了，然后又进一步要问：能不能老老实实地同群众共甘苦，共劳动，放下干部架子，向群众虚心学习？
    劳动是一面镜子，通过这面镜子，会清澈地显露一个人的阶级原形。有三种人，有三种劳动态度，一个资产阶级思想意识和生活习气很浓厚的人，拿起锄头、扁担来总是很勉强的，像有千斤重，掘土不到三分深。劳动态度飘浮，半夜唉声叹气，与劳动群众格格不入。一个小资产阶级思想意识和生活习气很浓厚的人，他的劳动态度是忽热忽冷，三天打鱼，五天晒网。忽而引吭高歌，忽而垂头丧气。一个具有劳动人民本质的人，他的劳动态度是勤勤恳恳的，全力干，尽力干，一贯积极，和劳动人民随时随地取得密切的联系，并虚心向他们学习。只有以劳动人民的态度，一贯积极地进行劳动，才能在知识海里学习到我们在书本上所不容易学到的丰富的生产斗争和阶级斗争知识。
    过五关，斩六气
    但是，不管是那一种人，一到基层，纳入了劳动组织，他的“三风”“五气”，对于知识分子来说是“三风”“六气”（加上书生气），是会大大减少的。环境变了，生活变了，工作变了，而且变动的程度很大。群众的眼睛是雪亮的，他们以尖锐的眼光，热烈的期待，注意每一个下放干部的劳动态度、干部架子、生活细节和对他们的真、假感情。这样，就一步步地促使一个下放干部，特别是知识分子的干部不得不同自己的一些不良习气和劣根性进行自觉的斗争。
    “过五关”（劳动关、生活关、组织关、群众关、学习关）、“斩六气”（官气、阔气、暮气、骄气、娇气、书生气）并不是简单、轻易的过程，是细致的复杂的长期的斗争。而且这个关与那个关，这个气与那个气是密切地联系着的，不可能先打算过了这一关才来过那个关，先斩掉这个气才来斩那个气。过好这些关，斩掉这些气，才能把自己锻炼成为具有明确的工人阶级立场的社会主义新人。
    劳动的过程，生活在劳动群众大熔炉里的过程，是辩证发展的过程。这里面有对立面的斗争和统一，有量变与质变，有矛盾的转化，由非工人阶级逐步转化到工人阶级。我在下放期间的深切体会中，感到党的干部下放政策的正确和英明。
    除了极少数的顽固不化的人以外，人是可以改造的；但人的改造不可能大跃进。劳动能治百病，包括思想病在内。但是，只有在工人阶级的政党——共产党的领导下，人才能得到彻底的改造，从而为由社会主义向共产主义过渡奠定了思想建设的基础。
    各位委员、各位同志：周总理告诉我们：“我们的事业，各方面都在欣欣向荣，都在快步前进，这是因为我们的事业是正义的事业，是受到广大人民支持的事业。”这几句话概括了我们祖国的前进面貌和全国人民的共同意志。我们响应党和毛主席的一切号召，紧密地团结起来，以雄伟、壮健、整齐的步伐，向社会主义的灿烂大道迈进，来迎接我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国建立的十周年！
    最后谨祝各位委员、各位同志身体健康；大会胜利成功！
