During the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all members attended the First Session of the Second National People's Congress as observers, listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's Report on the Work of the Government, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959, and unanimously expressed their warm support. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country have victoriously carried out the anti-Rightist struggle and the nationwide rectification movement, and implemented the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, thus enabling China's socialist construction to achieve an all-round Great Leap Forward in 1958. The 1959 National Economic Plan adopted by the First Session of the Second National People's Congress is a magnificent plan for continuing the Great Leap Forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The meeting is deeply convinced that as long as the people of the whole country continue to go all out, improve technology, practice increasing production and practicing economy, and strive to overcome difficulties, this magnificent plan will definitely be accomplished.

The meeting unanimously approved the Resolution on the Tibet Issue passed by the First Session of the Second National People's Congress. The original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique colluded with imperialists and foreign interventionists, tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and launched an armed rebellion that betrayed the motherland, undermined national unity, and harmed the Tibetan people. This is absolutely intolerable to the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and is absolutely intolerable to the law of the country. Tibet has always been an inseparable part of China's territory, and the Tibetan ethnic group is a member of the great family of Chinese ethnic groups. The Tibet issue is China's internal affair and no foreign interference is allowed. The actions of certain expansionist elements in India who inherited the mantle of British imperialism's aggression, supported the Tibetan reactionary clique's rebellion, and demanded so-called "Tibetan independence" have seriously undermined the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and damaged the great friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples, which has not only aroused great anger among the Chinese people, but also violated the interests of the Indian people.

The meeting unanimously and warmly congratulated the Central People's Government on the victory in suppressing the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary clique. This great victory has further consolidated our country's national unity and ethnic solidarity, and guaranteed the smooth progress of ethnic regional autonomy and social reform in Tibet. The meeting expresses its highest respect to the heroic People's Liberation Army, which was ordered to suppress the Tibetan rebel clique, and expresses its highest respect to the Tibetan monks and lay people who assisted the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the rebellion.

Both the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are meetings of great unity of the people of the whole country and meetings to promote the continued Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. The Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference calls on the people of all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all patriotic people across the country to further strengthen unity, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, resolutely implement the resolutions of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 National Economic Plan, and continue to advance towards building our country into a great, prosperous, and strong socialist country.

    中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议的政治决议
    一九五九年四月二十九日中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次全体会议通过
    在中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议期间，全体委员列席了第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，听取了周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，一致表示热烈拥护。全国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，胜利地进行了反右派斗争和全民整风运动，贯彻执行了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，从而使一九五八年我国的社会主义建设获得了全面的大跃进。第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过的一九五九年国民经济计划，是一个在一九五八年大跃进的基础上继续大跃进的宏伟计划。会议深信，只要全国人民继续鼓足干劲，提高技术，厉行增产节约，努力克服困难，这个宏伟计划，是一定能够完成的。
    会议一致同意第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议所通过的关于西藏问题的决议。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团同帝国主义者和外国干涉者勾结起来，撕毁和平解放西藏的十七条协议，发动背叛祖国、破坏国家统一、残害西藏人民的武装叛乱，这是西藏人民和全国各族人民绝对不能容许的，是国法绝对不能容许的。西藏从来是中国领土的不可分割的一部分，藏族是中国各民族大家庭中的一员。西藏问题是中国的内政问题，决不容许外国人干涉。印度某些扩张主义分子继承英帝国主义侵略衣钵，支持西藏反动集团叛乱，要求所谓“西藏独立”的行为，严重地破坏和平共处的五项原则，损害中印两国人民的伟大友谊，不仅引起中国人民的极大愤怒，而且违反印度人民的利益。
    会议一致热烈祝贺中央人民政府平定西藏反动集团叛乱的胜利。这一个伟大胜利更加巩固了我国的国家统一和民族团结，保证了西藏地方的民族区域自治和社会改革的顺利进行。会议对于奉命讨伐西藏叛乱集团的英勇的人民解放军表示崇高的敬意，对于协助人民解放军平定叛乱的西藏僧俗人民表示崇高的敬意。
    第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议都是全国人民大团结的会议，是促进社会主义建设继续大跃进的会议。中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会号召全国各族人民、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和一切爱国人士，进一步加强团结，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，坚决执行第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的各项决议，为完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划而奋斗，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的、繁荣的、富强的社会主义国家而继续前进。
