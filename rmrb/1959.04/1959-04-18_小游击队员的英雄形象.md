　　The Heroic Image of a Young Guerrilla Fighter
　　Yang Zimin
　　In the readers' memories, perhaps the heroic images of the "Railway Guerrilla" fighters are still vivid. Now, in the book "The Little Members of the Railway Guerrilla" (written by Liu Zhixia), we see the activities of the children again. Three twelve- or thirteen-year-old children—Xiao Zhang, Xiao Yin, and Xiao Zhu—joined the Railway Guerrilla, and under the leadership of Captain Liu Hong, they appeared in the enemy's strongholds and were active on the enemy's transportation lines, performing difficult tasks such as reconnaissance of enemy situations and communication liaison. In that legendary struggle, they gradually became more resourceful and brave.
　　Similar to "Railway Guerrilla," the author has arranged many thrilling and tortuous plots and scenes in this book, but it is not only used to attract readers, but through the portrayal of the three "little members," to shape the images of several young soldiers. Although the author's portrayal of these three characters is not perfect, it has achieved some success.
　　Among the three children, Xiao Zhang is the most outstanding. He is bold, calm, resourceful, and good at finding favorable opportunities in unfavorable situations. When scouting the enemy's situation in Lanshan Village, he immediately ran to pretend to help when he found that the enemy's cook was full of complaints due to the hot weather and few people. He found out the number of people eating; and used the method of "helping" to serve dishes and collect dishes to find out the enemy's weapons and equipment in the dining hall. Later, he skillfully broke through the enemy's heavily guarded railway line and delivered an order related to the entire battle situation to the designated contact point.
　　The author's portrayal of Xiao Yin is more delicate and touching. Xiao Yin is afraid of the dark, but the first time he performed a task alone, it happened to be on a stormy night. In the performance of the task, he kept cheering himself up, but he could not dispel the fear in his heart for a moment. In the incident of seizing weapons on the enemy's train, Xiao Yin was taken 700 miles away by the train because he was afraid of jumping off the train in the dark, making a thrilling journey. Through this extraordinary journey, the author focused on describing the development of Xiao Yin's character and his process of overcoming his weaknesses.
　　I think this work still has some shortcomings and deficiencies. The motivation that promotes and encourages those little protagonists to venture into danger and create miracles is not fully expressed in the work. During the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, many children in the Liberated Areas did participate in the revolutionary struggle at that time in various forms. This was not out of childhood fantasy and curiosity, but generally had a relatively clear purpose. Some because their hometowns had suffered the enemy's bestial ravages, and some because their fathers and brothers were fighting a desperate battle with the enemy. The education of real life and the revolutionary struggle at that time were closely linked to their childhood. Their young hearts already had a clear distinction between the enemy and ourselves, so they could make a difference. This point is not clearly written in the work.
　　The work's handling of certain plots seems simple and rough. Like in chapters four and five, Xiao Zhang's surveillance and listening to the activities of the enemy and puppet township chief in Lanshan Village, as well as his several contacts and conversations with the old hired worker, make people feel that they lack the characteristics of children's psychology and language. The characters and struggles are relatively simple, which weakens the artistic authenticity of the work. At the same time, looking at the whole book, the author has not put enough effort into refining the language, and the language is relatively rough.
　　In the chapter where Xiao Zhang and the senior detective have a misunderstanding, I think the description of the senior detectives is inappropriate. Xiao Zhang met the "senior detectives" on the road in order to send an urgent order to Commander Hu. In order to protect the chief, the "senior detectives" pretended to be enemy agents. They found Xiao Zhang's actions suspicious, so they tied him up and interrogated him. Although the author has pointed out in the work that this is a violation of policy, the reader's aversion to the "senior detectives" cannot be reversed. From the perspective of the whole book's structure, such a description is unnecessary. If other methods are used, which can not only show Xiao Zhang's quality of being unyielding to power, but also not damage the image of other soldiers, the effect will be better.

### 小游击队员的英雄形象

　　小游击队员的英雄形象
　　杨子敏
    在读者们的记忆里，也许还活跃着“铁道游击队”的战士们的英雄形象。现在，在“铁道游击队的小队员们”（刘知侠著）这本书里，我们又看到了小朋友们的活动。三个十二、三岁的孩子——小张、小银和小朱，加入了铁道游击队，在刘洪大队长的领导下，出没于敌人的据点里，活跃在敌人的交通线上，执行着侦察敌情、通讯联络等等困难任务，他们在那种富于传奇色彩的斗争中逐渐锻炼得更加机智和勇敢。
    和“铁道游击队”相似，作者在这本书里也安排了不少惊险、曲折的情节和场面，但是，它并不仅仅以此来吸引读者，而是通过对三个“小队员”的刻划，塑造出几个小战士的形象。虽然作者对这三个人物形象的塑造并不尽善尽美，但也取得了一定的成功。
    在三个孩子当中，小张是最突出的一个，他大胆、沉着、机智，善于在不利的情况下找寻有利的时机。在侦察蓝山庄的敌情的时候，他一发现敌人的伙夫由于天热、人少而牢骚满腹，便立即跑去假装帮忙，探得了敌人吃饭的人数；又以“帮助”端菜、收菜盆的方法，在饭场查明了敌人的武器装备。后来，他又巧妙地闯过了敌人警戒森严的铁路线，把一份关系整个战局的命令送到了指定的联络地点。
    作者对于小银的刻划，比较细致动人。小银害怕黑夜，然而他第一次单独执行任务的时候，恰巧是在一个风雨交加的夜晚。在执行任务当中，他不住地为自己壮胆，但又一刻也不能驱散内心的恐惧。在夺取敌人火车上的武器的事件中，小银因怕在黑夜里跳车，被列车带走七百里，作了一次惊险的旅行。作者通过这次不平凡的旅行，着力描写了小银性格的发展和他克服弱点的过程。
    这本作品我觉得还存在一些缺点和不足之处。作品里表现推动和鼓舞那些小主人公们出入险境、创造奇迹的动力还不够充分。在抗日战争和解放战争中，解放区的许多孩子们，的确曾以各种形式参加了当时的革命斗争，这并非出于童年的幻想和好奇，而一般是有比较明确的目的的。有的因为他们的家乡遭受过敌人兽性的蹂躏，有的他们的父兄正在和敌人进行殊死的战斗，现实生活的教育，当时的革命斗争，紧紧和他们的童年联系在一起，他们幼小的心灵里已经有了明确的敌我界限，因此他们才有所作为。这一点，作品里是写得还不清楚的。
    作品对某些情节的处理，显得简单、粗糙。像第四、五章里，小张在蓝山庄监视、探听敌伪乡长的活动，以及他和老长工的几次接触和交谈，使人感到缺少儿童心理和语言的特征。人物和斗争比较简单，因而也就减弱了作品的艺术真实性。同时就全书来看，作者在语言的锤炼方面下功夫不够，语言比较粗糙。
    作者在小张和大侦察员闹误会这一章里，对大侦察员们的描写，我以为是不妥当的。小张为了把一份紧急命令送给胡司令员，在路上和“大侦察员”遇上了。“大侦察员”们为了保卫首长，伪装敌特模样，发现小张行迹可疑，便把小张绑吊起来，审讯了一番。虽然作者在作品里已指出这是违反政策的行为，但读者对“大侦察员”们的反感仍不能扭转。从全书结构看来，这样的描写并无必要。如果用别的办法，既能表现小张的威武不能屈的品质，又不损伤其他战士的形象，效果会更好一些。
