Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 14th: Many people in the Tibetan rebel forces who were threatened into joining the rebellion have recently surrendered to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The PLA has leniently treated these rebel members who surrendered voluntarily, in accordance with the central government's policy, allowing them to return home and reunite with their parents, wives, and children.

These rebel members who surrendered to the PLA have exposed the crimes of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group in launching the rebellion and persecuting the Tibetan people, based on the facts they witnessed.

Pu Jue, who lived in the eastern district of Lhasa, was deceived and coerced into joining the rebellion. Following the rebels, he fled to the Pengbo area north of Lhasa. There, the rebel leaders ordered them to plunder the property of local residents in groups. They stole all the horses from the local area, as well as a lot of fodder, highland barley, tsampa, and butter. He saw that the people hated the rebels very much, and the rebels were fleeing everywhere in a state of disarray because they could not get the support of the people. Seeing that following the rebels would only lead to death, he decided to break away from the rebels and secretly hid in the mountains. Later, he heard that the central government had adopted a lenient policy towards those who were coerced into joining the rebellion, and that the PLA had quelled the Lhasa rebellion, so he resolutely returned to Lhasa and surrendered to the PLA. He has now returned home and reunited with his family.

Tailor Qiangba Dengzeng was forced to join the rebellion on March 19th by the rebels under the pretext of sewing clothes. The next day, he saw many people running away one after another. He also secretly ran out and hid in his uncle's house, and then returned to Lhasa to surrender to the PLA. When he surrendered, he said that the evil deeds committed by the rebels in the Pengbo area were endless. The local people cursed the rebels for being black-hearted. As soon as the rebels arrived in Pengbo, they searched for women everywhere. They raped women inhumanly in front of their families, and even old women in their sixties were insulted. Two nuns were returning home from the temple when they were stopped and gang-raped by six rebels. Before fleeing, the rebels robbed all the horses and many properties of the local residents, and slaughtered many sheep of the herders on the way.

Jiangcun, who was coerced into joining the rebellion, said when surrendering to the PLA: Of the six of us who were captured by the rebels, five have already escaped back, and the other one's fate is unknown. I have a wife and children at home. The rebels took me away, who will support them? If I continue to follow the rebels, I don't know where I will die. Jiangcun was very moved after being treated leniently and took the initiative to ask to lead the PLA to completely eliminate the rebels.

　　目睹西藏上层反动集团残害人民的罪行
　　许多被威胁参加叛乱的人纷纷投诚
　　他们已受到宽大处理回家和家人团聚
    新华社拉萨14日电　西藏叛匪中许多被威胁参加叛乱的人，最近纷纷向人民解放军投诚。人民解放军对这些自动投诚的叛乱分子，都按照中央方针作了宽大处理，让他们回家和父母妻子团聚。
    这些向人民解放军投诚的叛乱分子，都以目睹的事实，揭露了西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱残害西藏人民的罪行。
    住在拉萨市东城区的普觉，被欺骗胁迫参加叛乱后，随着叛匪逃到了拉萨以北的彭波地区。在那里，叛匪头子要他们成群结队地去抢劫当地居民的财物，他们抢走了当地所有的马匹，还抢走了许多饲料、青稞、糌粑和酥油。他看到人民都非常痛恨叛匪，叛匪在得不到人民支持的情况下到处狼狈逃窜。他看到跟着叛匪走只有死路一条，就决定脱离叛匪，偷偷地逃到山上躲起来。后来，他听说中央对胁从的叛乱分子采取宽大政策，又听说人民解放军已经平息了拉萨叛乱，就毅然回到拉萨向人民解放军投诚。目前他已经回家和家人团聚。
    裁缝强巴登增是在3月19日被叛乱分子以缝衣为名强迫参加叛乱的。第二天，他看到很多人陆续逃跑，他也偷偷地跑出来躲在他的伯父家里，然后又回到拉萨向人民解放军投诚。他在投诚的时候说，叛匪在彭波地区干下的坏事说也说不完，当地人民都咒骂叛匪是黑心肠。叛匪一到彭波，就到处搜索女人，他们毫无人性地当着全家人面前强奸妇女，连六十多岁的老婆婆也遭到了污辱。有两个尼姑从庙里回家，路上被六个叛匪拦住轮奸。叛匪在临逃跑前抢走了当地居民所有的马和许多财物，并在途中抢杀了牧民们许多绵羊。
    被胁迫参加叛乱的降村在向人民解放军投诚时说：我们一起被叛匪抓去的六个人，五个人已经逃回来了，另外一个还不知死活。我家里有老婆孩子，叛匪抓走了我，谁来养活他们呢。要是再跟着叛匪走，我不知道会死在什么地方。降村在得到宽大处理后非常感动，主动要求给人民解放军带路，彻底消灭叛匪。
