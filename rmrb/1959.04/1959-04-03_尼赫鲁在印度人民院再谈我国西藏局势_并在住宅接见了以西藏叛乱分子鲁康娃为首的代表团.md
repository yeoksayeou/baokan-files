Xinhua News Agency, April 1st. According to the Indian News Agency, Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a lengthy speech in the Lok Sabha on March 30 regarding the Tibetan rebellion. In his speech, he emphasized the "long-standing ties" between India and Tibet. Nehru believed that India's reaction to the events in Tibet was bound to be very profound, and he "could not oppose those reactions." He also said, "We have great sympathy for the Tibetans." At the same time, he said, "It is important for us to establish friendly relations with China, a great country."

Nehru said that at present, we have a large amount of newspaper commentary, rumors, claims, and statements from the Chinese government. It is somewhat difficult to find the truth of what is happening from these things. He also said that it was difficult for him to make statements or announce actions based on vague rumors.

Nehru made these remarks in response to questions raised by opposition members regarding the Tibetan rebellion. Some members wanted to discuss the matter through temporary motions. After listening to Nehru's statement, the Speaker rejected these motions.

Nehru said, "We hope to establish friendly relations with the Tibetan people, we hope they will make progress in freedom, and so on. At the same time, maintaining friendly relations with China, a great country, is very important to us. This does not mean that I, our government, our parliament, or anyone should obey any orders from any country, no matter how great or large that country may be. The issue is not here, but it certainly means that in difficult situations, we should have a certain degree of self-restraint and adopt a wise attitude, and not do things in a moment of excitement that may put our country in difficulty."

One member asked him about the news of the so-called "Chinese troops gathering on the Sino-Indian border." Nehru said that he was completely unaware of this matter. He said: "Actually, I haven't even heard such rumors, let alone the facts." He advised the members not to believe the various claims that appear in the newspapers, saying that they are generally incorrect.

When talking about the issue of granting so-called "Tibetan refugees" "political asylum" raised by some members, Nehru said that all the recent questions raised about granting political asylum are not beneficial to those who may seek political asylum in India. "People must recognize the current difficult situation, rather than simply creating conditions that make the situation more difficult to handle, or make it more difficult to deal with those seeking political asylum."

Nehru said, all I can say is that we cannot but recognize China's sovereignty over Tibet. He said that there is a certain kinship between the Indian people and the Tibetan people. A feeling of cultural kinship. Of course, this does not mean that we interfere in Tibet in any way. He said that India once had privileges in Tibet in history, which were the remnants of British imperialism. He said, "Obviously, people seem to think that we have given up certain privileges in Tibet. The privileges we have given up in Tibet are privileges that we do not want to retain in any country in the world, in Tibet, or in any other country. Aside from emotional issues, from a purely practical point of view, it is clearly impossible for us to do anything legally, constitutionally, or practically in Tibet."

Regarding the three letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan that have already been published, Nehru said, "I hope to get more information to verify them, to explain what kind of letters they are, under what circumstances they were written, and whether they were really written."

Regarding the Xinhua News Agency's communique on the Tibetan rebellion, Nehru said, "This statement narrates some situations that they say are facts. I have nothing to say about this. I can neither confirm nor deny it, because what I know does not allow me to make a definite statement."

Regarding the point that Kalimpong is the command center for the Tibetan rebel groups abroad, Nehru said, "It is wrong to say that Kalimpong is a center for organizing activities." Regarding whether the Chinese government has raised any opinions about the conspiratorial activities of Tibetan rebels in Kalimpong, he said, "In the past few months—perhaps a year—there have been no complaints, but in the past three or four years, there may have been two or three mentions of Kalimpong, saying that some people are carrying out propaganda and similar activities in Kalimpong." He said that on two or three occasions, some inappropriate leaflets appeared in Kalimpong. The Indian government warned those who distributed the leaflets. Nehru said, "Our attitude has always been like this, and we have made it clear to people from Tibet, important people, that you are welcome to come here, but we cannot allow the use of Indian territory to carry out subversive activities against the government of a friendly country, or even aggressive propaganda activities." He also said, "As far as we know, in fact, we have not found any activities in Kalimpong in recent months."

Regarding the Indian parliament's discussion of the Tibetan rebellion, Nehru said, "This House, this Parliament, is fully entitled to discuss it, and it is completely free to say or do what it wants to say or do, to discuss any issue it wants to discuss, and this is always based on the needs of reason and wisdom, and you are the best judges of this need, and no one outside this House can make a judgment." At the same time, Nehru also said that when the Indian Parliament is "exercising this right, it should always be in the spirit of wisdom, always taking into account the consequences and how this right should be exercised."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 1st. Indian Prime Minister Nehru received a delegation headed by Lhukangwa Tsering Wangdu, a leader of the Tibetan rebels, on the morning of March 31.

The rebel delegation led by Lhukangwa included Yu Tu Tashi Dondrup and Gakang Lobsang Rinchen, who were ordered by the State Council to be dismissed and investigated. They gathered in the garden of Prime Minister Nehru's residence and submitted a "memorandum" to Nehru. According to Indian newspapers, this "memorandum" openly demanded that India intervene in the Tibetan rebellion and support the Tibetan rebels, in an attempt to undermine the friendly relations between China and India based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The "memorandum" requested the Indian government to be more actively concerned with ensuring the safety of the Dalai Lama, submit the Tibetan issue to the United Nations, grant so-called Tibetan refugees "political asylum," and send so-called charitable delegations to Tibet.

Traitor Lhukangwa Tsering Wangdu told the press afterwards that they were satisfied with the meeting with Nehru. He said that they would leave New Delhi and return to Kalimpong. A few people, including himself, would stay for further talks. These traitors came to New Delhi from Kalimpong a few days ago.

The official Indian news release said that Nehru listened to the opinions of this so-called "delegation" and spoke with them. Nehru "expressed hope that the current difficulties in Tibet would be resolved peacefully." He stated that "India cannot interfere, and in fact, India does not want to take any steps that might worsen the situation there."

    尼赫鲁在印度人民院再谈我国西藏局势
    并在住宅接见了以西藏叛乱分子鲁康娃为首的代表团
    新华社1日讯　据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁3月30日在人民院就西藏叛乱发表长篇讲话。他在讲话中着重讲到印度同西藏之间“悠久的联系”。尼赫鲁认为，印度对西藏发生的事情的反应必定是非常深刻的，他“不能反对那些反应”。他并且说，“我们对西藏人表示很大的同情”。同时他又说，“对于我们来说重要的是，同中国这个伟大的国家建立友好的关系”。
    尼赫鲁说，在目前，我们有一大堆报纸上的言论、谣言、说法和中国政府的声明。要从这些东西里找出正在发生的事情的真实情况是有些困难的。他又说，他很难根据含糊的谣传而发表声明，或者宣布将采取某种行动。
    尼赫鲁是在答复反对党议员就西藏叛乱所提出的问题时讲这番话的。有一些议员想通过临时动议来讨论这件事。议长在听了尼赫鲁的发言以后否决了这些动议。
    尼赫鲁说，“我们希望同西藏人民建立友好的关系，我们希望他们在自由中取得进步，等等。同时，同中国这个伟大的国家保持友好关系对我们来说是非常重要的。这并不意味着我、我们政府、我们议会或任何人应该服从任何国家的任何命令，不管这个国家可能有多么伟大或者多大。问题不在这里，但是，这也肯定意味着，我们在困难的局面中应该有一定程度的自制和采取明智态度，而不要在一时的激动的情况下做出一些可能使我们国家遇到困难的事情来”。
    有议员问他有关所谓“中国军队在中印边境集结”的消息，尼赫鲁说，他现在完全不知道这件事。他说：“实际上，我连这样的谣言都没听到过，更不用说事实了。”他劝告议员们不要相信报纸上出现的各种各样的说法，他说，一般说来，它们是不正确的。
    在谈到有一些议员提出的给予所谓“西藏难民”以“政治避难权”问题时，尼赫鲁说，最近所提出的关于给予政治避难权的一切问题对于那些可能要求在印度进行政治避难的人们是没有好处的。“人们必须认识目前的困难情况，而不是一味制造条件，使得局势更难处理，或者使要求政治避难的人更难处置”。
    尼赫鲁说，我所能说的一切是，我们不能不承认中国对西藏的主权。他说，印度人民和西藏人民之间有着某种亲戚的关系。文化上亲戚关系的感情。当然，这并不意味着我们以任何方式干涉西藏。他说，印度曾经在历史上对西藏有过特权，那是英帝国主义的残余。他说，“显然，人们似乎认为我们放弃了在西藏的某些特权。我们在西藏所放弃的特权是我们不想在世界上任何国家、在西藏或者任何别的国家保有的特权。且不谈感情问题，从纯粹实际的观点来看，我们在法律上、在宪法上或者在实际上显然都不可能在西藏做任何事情。”
    关于已经发表的达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封信，尼赫鲁说，“我希望能多得到一些消息来证实它们，说明它们是甚么信件，是在甚么情况下写的，是不是真的写了这些信。”
    对于新华社关于西藏叛乱事件的公报，尼赫鲁说，“这个声明叙述了据他们说是事实的一些情况，对于这点我没有甚么要说，我既不能加以证实，也不能加以否认，因为我所知道的情况不能使我发表肯定的声明。”
    关于噶伦堡是西藏叛乱集团在国外的指挥中心这一点，尼赫鲁说，“要说噶伦堡是一种组织活动的中心，那是错误的。”关于中国政府是否对西藏叛乱分子在噶伦堡的阴谋活动提出过意见，他说，“在过去几个月——也许是一年中，并没有任何不满意见，但是过去三、四年中也许有过两次或许三次提到噶伦堡，说某些人在噶伦堡进行宣传和类似的活动”。他说，有两三次，噶伦堡出现了一些不相适宜的传单。印度政府对那些散发传单的人提出了警告。尼赫鲁说，“我们的态度一直是这样，并且我们已向来自西藏的人士、重要的人士清楚地说明，欢迎你们来这里，但是我们不能允许利用印度的领土对友好国家的政府进行颠复活动，或者那怕是咄咄逼人的宣传活动。”他还说，“就我们所知，事实上在最近几个月中我们并未发现噶伦堡有任何活动”。
    关于印度议会讨论西藏叛乱事件这一点，尼赫鲁说，“本院、本议会是完全可以讨论的，它完全有自由说或者做它想说或做的事，讨论它所想讨论的任何问题，而这总是以理智和智慧的需要为根据，对于这种需要你们是最善于判断的，本院以外的其他任何人都不能下判断”。同时，尼赫鲁又说，当印度议会在“运用这种权利时，始终应该本着智慧，始终要考虑到后果以及应该如何来行使这种权利”。
    新华社新德里1日电　印度总理尼赫鲁3月31日上午接见了一个以西藏叛乱分子领袖鲁康娃·泽旺饶登为首的代表团。
    由鲁康娃率领的叛乱分子代表团中包括被国务院明令撤职究办的宇妥·扎西顿珠、噶章·洛桑日增等人，他们聚集在尼赫鲁总理住宅的花园里，向尼赫鲁提出了一项“备忘录”。据印度报刊透露，这项“备忘录”公然要求印度干预西藏叛乱，支持西藏叛乱分子，企图破坏中印两国建立在五项原则基础上的友好关系。“备忘录”要求印度政府更加积极地关心保证达赖喇嘛的安全，把西藏问题提交联合国，给所谓西藏难民以“政治避难权”以及派遣所谓慈善代表团前往西藏。
    叛国分子鲁康娃·泽旺饶登在事后向报界说，他们对同尼赫鲁的会谈感到满意。他说，他们这批人将离开新德里回噶伦堡。少数人，包括他在内将留下来作进一步的会谈。这些叛国分子是几天前从噶伦堡来到新德里的。
    印度官方发表的新闻公报说，尼赫鲁听取了这个所谓“代表团”的意见，并且和他们谈了话。尼赫鲁“表示希望西藏目前的困难会和平解决”。他表明“印度不能够进行干预、事实上印度也不想采取任何可能使那里的局势恶化的步骤”。
