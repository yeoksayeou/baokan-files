On the south of the motherland, trees are green, flowers are red, and birds are singing. But here in the Wuda Coal Mine on the frontier, none of these can be seen. The Wuda Coal Mine is located in Alxa League, Bayannur League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. It is a mountainous and desert area with no trees, no flowers, and no birds. But its spring has a different kind of charming scenery.

Every time dawn breaks, the earth awakens from its slumber, and the majestic Helan Mountains, like a drowsy giant, are immersed in a vast sea of fog, looming indistinctly. The distant peaks are arranged in various giant patterns, appearing both solemn and peaceful and distant. The sun comes out, casting rays of golden light, and the earth and space suddenly appear bright and open. The Helan Mountains are also suddenly radiant and full of spirit. The Yellow River, flowing eastward along the foot of the mountain, is illuminated by the sun with golden waves, singing happily as it rushes down.

What a beautiful spring scenery outside the Great Wall! However, the spring in people's hearts far exceeds the spring of the season. The tens of thousands of workers at the Wuda Coal Mine are dedicating all their youthful vitality to the intense battle for coal, working selflessly to overfulfill this year's raw coal production and mine construction tasks.

Under the leadership of the mine's Party committee, a vigorous red flag competition has been carried out throughout the mine since March 10. From far away from the mining area, you can hear the sound of cannons, which is the workers blasting rocks. With the sound of cannons, clouds of thick smoke rise, and the blasted rubble rises into the air in the smoke, shooting straight into the sky. The trains on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway roar and rush in, unloading lumber from the Greater Khingan Mountains at the station, and pulling coke and raw coal to Hohhot, Baotou, Bayannur League... Heavy-duty trucks transporting various materials shuttle back and forth, kicking up dust. There are also carriages one after another, and camel teams with bells ringing, all busy transporting materials for the mining area.

The coal miners underground are engaged in intense combat. Since the launch of the Red Flag competition, the Pioneer Tunneling Team of the Second Battalion of the First Mine has maintained a tunneling speed of 7.996 meters per day. When the Third Company of the Fourth Battalion of the Second Mine started the competition, they sat on the "ox cart" twice (meaning slow progress). The company leaders and workers immediately held a meeting to discuss ways to increase production. After the meeting, they worked hard day and night, and the output rose sharply, exceeding the original production quota by 167%, and went "rocketing up" on the rise-and-fall chart on the 25th. The daily output leapfrog target of the Third Mine was 800 tons, but thanks to the hard work and ingenuity of the workers, it broke through the 1,000-ton mark on March 26.

In these days, under the encouragement of the red flag, so many moving deeds have appeared! Today, this mine breaks through the leapfrog target, tomorrow, that mine sees a high-yield record, and the day after tomorrow, the well construction team completes the first quarter's well construction task twenty days ahead of schedule.... As of March 26, the entire mine had seized 304,299 tons of raw coal, overfulfilling the first quarter's production task of 300,000 tons of raw coal five days ahead of schedule. The mine's capital construction also overfulfilled the first quarter's task by 23.5% ahead of schedule.

Wuda won the first red flag for completing the first quarter's production task. In this bright and beautiful season, the workers of the Wuda Coal Mine are high in morale and full of vigor, using their soaring revolutionary spirit and infinite wisdom to raise the red flag high on the Helan Mountains, letting the red flag bathe in the bright spring sunshine and flutter in the warm spring breeze.

    贺兰山上舞红旗
    沈作仙
    在祖国的江南，早已树绿花红，鸟啼莺啭了。可是在这塞外的乌达煤矿，却看不到这些。乌达煤矿在内蒙古自治区巴彦淖尔盟阿拉善旗境内，是高山和沙漠地带，既没有树，没有花，又没有飞鸟。但它的春天，却有另一番迷人的景象。
    每当黎明的时候，大地沉睡初醒，巍峨连绵的贺兰山，像一个睡意蒙矓的巨人，沉浸在白茫茫的雾海之中，若隐若现；远一些的山峰，排列成各种巨型的图案，既显得肃穆庄严，又那么和平淡远。太阳出来了，射出万道金光，大地和太空骤然显得明朗开阔起来。贺兰山也顿时容光焕发，精神奕奕。沿山脚东流的黄河，被阳光照得金波闪闪，高兴的唱着歌欢腾而下。
    多么美好的塞外春光啊！可是，人们心上的春天，更远远的超过了季节上的春天。乌达煤矿的几万职工，正以自己的全部青春活力，投入紧张的夺煤战斗，为超额完成今年的原煤生产和矿区建设任务而忘我地劳动着。
    从3月10日起，在矿党委的领导下，全矿开展了轰轰烈烈的红旗竞赛运动。离矿区很远，就可以听到??的炮声，这是工人们正在开山炸石。随着炮声飞起团团浓烟，被炸的碎石在烟雾中腾空而起，直射云霄。包兰线上的列车，吼叫着急驰而来，在站上卸下来自大兴安岭的元木，又拉上焦炭和原煤，开往呼和浩特、包头、巴盟……运输各种物资的载重卡车，扬着沙尘往来如梭。还有那一辆接一辆的马车，那响着铃当的骆驼队，都在为矿区的物资运输而奔忙。
    井下采煤的工人们，正在进行紧张的战斗。红旗竞赛运动开展十天以来，一矿二营先锋掘进队一直保持了日进七点九九六公尺的掘进速度。二矿四营三连在竞赛开始，连坐了两次牛车，连的领导上和工人们当即开会讨论提高产量的办法。开完会后，苦战了一昼夜，产量便直线上升，超过原生产定额167％，在25日的升降图上坐上了火箭。三矿的日产跃进指标是八百吨，经过职工们的苦干和巧干，到3月26日便突破了千吨大关了。
    这些日子来，在红旗的鼓舞下，有多少动人的事迹出现啊！今天这个矿突破了跃进指标，明天那个矿出现了高产纪录，后天又是建井处提前二十天完成了第一季度的建井任务……。到3月26日止，全矿已夺下三十万零四千二百九十九吨原煤，提前五天超额完成了第一季度生产原煤三十万吨的任务。矿区的基本建设，也同时超额23.5％提前完成了第一季度的任务。
    乌达夺得了完成第一季度生产任务的第一面红旗。在这春光明媚的季节里，乌达煤矿的工人们斗志昂扬，意气奋发，以自己的冲天革命干劲和无穷智慧，把红旗高高插在贺兰山上，让红旗沐浴着灿烂的春光，迎着和煦的春风飘扬。
