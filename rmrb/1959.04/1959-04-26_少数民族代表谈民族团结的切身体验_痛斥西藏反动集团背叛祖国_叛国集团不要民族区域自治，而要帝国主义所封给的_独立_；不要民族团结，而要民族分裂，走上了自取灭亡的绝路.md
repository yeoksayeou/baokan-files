Xinhua News Agency, April 25th – Representatives from the motherland's border regions spoke to our reporter about the important significance of national unity. They pointed out that only by closely uniting in the motherland's big family can all minority nationalities develop economically and thoroughly change the poverty and backwardness historically left behind. The representatives also used their own personal experiences to vehemently condemn the Tibetan reactionary clique's crimes of betraying the motherland and undermining unification.

The Mongolian representative Wang Zaitian introduced the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He said: The face of Inner Mongolia has greatly changed. In the past, we were "empty-handed," but last year we produced more than 80,000 tons of iron and more than 10,000 tons of steel, thus ending Inner Mongolia's history of not producing iron and steel. Driven by iron and steel production, the entire region has established 140,000 various types of factories and mines, vigorously supporting agricultural and pastoral production. In 1958, the autonomous region's grain output reached more than 10 billion jin, doubling that of 1957. Animal husbandry overcame serious natural disasters, with a net increase of 2.08 million head of livestock in one year. In economic construction, Mongolians, Hans, and other ethnic groups treated each other equally, helping each other, and a new situation of unprecedented national unity and large-scale production cooperation emerged. The lives of all ethnic groups have also improved accordingly with the development of production.

Representative Wang Zaitian said: The people of Inner Mongolia, who live a life of love and happiness, have deep sympathy for their Tibetan brothers. The Mongolian and Tibetan nationalities have a long history of close ties. We Mongolian people resolutely oppose the treasonous crimes of a small handful of reactionary elements in Tibet and firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, the Tibetan people will certainly embark on the same path of happiness and prosperity to socialism as all fraternal nationalities.

Jiakulin, a representative from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, told reporters: Xinjiang's socialist economic construction is developing at a high speed, just like the Han areas. He said that just after liberation, the entire Xinjiang region only had a few small factories with rudimentary equipment. Now, a large number of modern industrial and mining enterprises, such as petroleum, non-ferrous metals, iron and steel, machinery, and electricity, have been established. Small factories and mines are scattered everywhere, throughout urban and rural areas. In the early days of liberation, Xinjiang's grain output was 2 billion jin, but last year it had increased to 6.4 billion jin, with an average of more than 1,000 jin of grain per person, ensuring that every household has enough food and clothing. The autonomous region's forestry and animal husbandry production are also developing rapidly. Representative Jiakulin said: These brilliant achievements are inseparable from national unity and the selfless assistance of the Han elder brother. In particular, the People's Liberation Army has made outstanding contributions to Xinjiang's economic construction. They have turned more than 3 million mu of wilderness into oases and established many mechanized state-owned farms and ranches. The mechanized farming and advanced agricultural technology of the Production and Construction Corps have a profound impact on farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. They have built a large number of factories on the barren Gobi Desert and cut through ice and mountains to build highways on the Tianshan Mountains at an altitude of 4,000 meters. The blood and sweat of the People's Liberation Army have been sprinkled all over the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. They have forged a flesh-and-blood national friendship with the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

Representative Jiakulin said: We, the people of Xinjiang, cherish the unity of all nationalities as we cherish our own lives. Imperialism once bought over a few minority ethnic scum in Xinjiang, such as Imin Ehsani, etc., under the guise of "national independence" to undermine the unification of the motherland and national unity. This conspiracy has been thoroughly crushed. The conspiracy of imperialism and Indian expansionists to interfere in our internal affairs will surely meet with shameful failure!

The representatives of minority nationalities from Yunnan were very proud of the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland's border areas. In their hometown, after the people of all nationalities realized national regional autonomy, they were creating miracles that had never been seen in history. In the first half of last year alone, an average of more than 40 medium-sized and small factories and mines were built and put into production every day in the border areas of Yunnan. Some ethnic groups had not separated handicrafts from agriculture until recently, but now, with the help of Han workers, they have manufactured many new products such as tractors. The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan has also established a tractor station using its own production equipment. Some minority ethnic groups used to use wooden plows, wooden rakes, and wooden sticks for cultivation and relied on special state care for grain every year. Last year, they generally used new-style farm tools and learned how to build water conservancy projects and accumulate fertilizer, which quadrupled their grain output, making them self-sufficient and even having a surplus. When the representatives from Yunnan talked about these profound changes, they pointed out that the people of all ethnic groups clearly know from their life practice that the policy of national regional autonomy and the policy of national unity are policies that guarantee the common progress and development of all ethnic groups; the road guided by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao is the road to light and happiness. The Tibetan reactionary group is extremely corrupt. They betrayed the motherland and did not want national regional autonomy, but the "independence" bestowed by imperialism; they did not want national unity, but national division, embarking on a path of self-destruction, truly "committing sins and cannot live."

"Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Tibetan people of Qinghai have been liberated from the hell on earth." When Representative Zhaxi Wangxu introduced the changes in Qinghai to reporters, he talked about some exciting scenes. He said: The vast Tibetan areas of Qinghai have destroyed the backward and dark feudal rule, the herdsmen have been completely liberated, and the people's commune has been realized. Many hardworking people who had suffered various tortures such as chopping off hands and digging out eyes by the feudal ruling class are now receiving care and attention from the people's communes. In the past, a large number of extremely poor households who lived in the wild and had no clothes to wear now live in new tents and wear new clothes. Many places in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have also built tile-roofed houses. Tianjun County, Haixi Mongolian Tibetan and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, which was famous for its poverty, now has an average of 80 head of livestock per person. Zhaxi Wangxu said: All these progresses cannot be denied by anyone. Facts have proved that all minority ethnic groups, including Tibetans, must unite in the motherland's big family and take the socialist road under the leadership of the Party in order to prosper and be happy. The Tibetan reactionary group is acting against the trend of history and dreaming of continuing to maintain the darkest, most reactionary, and cruel serf system, relying on imperialism and foreign reactionaries, and has become a criminal who betrays national interests and national interests.

    少数民族代表谈民族团结的切身体验
    痛斥西藏反动集团背叛祖国
    叛国集团不要民族区域自治，而要帝国主义所封给的“独立”；不要民族团结，而要民族分裂，走上了自取灭亡的绝路
    新华社25日讯　来自祖国边疆的人大代表们，向本社记者谈述民族大团结的重要意义。他们指出，各少数民族只有紧密团结在祖国大家庭中，经济上才能得到发展，才能彻底改变历史上遗留下来的贫困落后的状态。代表们并用切身体验痛斥西藏反动集团背叛祖国破坏统一的罪行。
    蒙古族的人大代表王再天，介绍了内蒙古自治区大跃进的情况。他说：内蒙古的面貌已经大为改观。过去我们是“手无寸铁”，去年生产八万多吨铁，一万多吨钢，从此结束了内蒙古不产钢铁的历史。在钢铁生产的带动下，全区已经建立十四万座各种类型的厂矿，有力地支援了农牧业生产。自治区1958年粮食产量已达一百多亿斤，比1957年翻了一番；畜牧业战胜严重的自然灾害，一年之内纯增牲畜二百零八万头。在经济建设中，蒙古族、汉族和其他民族不分彼此，相互帮助，出现了空前的民族大团结、生产大协作的新局面。各族人民的生活，也随着生产发展相应改善。
    王再天代表说：过着友爱、幸福生活的内蒙古人民，对于西藏兄弟怀着深切的同情。蒙藏民族在历史上有悠久的密切联系，我们蒙古族人民坚决反对西藏一小撮反动分子的叛国罪行，并且深信西藏民族在党的领导下，必将和各兄弟民族一样，走上幸福繁荣的社会主义大道。
    新疆维吾尔自治区的人大代表贾库林告诉记者：新疆的社会主义经济建设，正在同汉族地区一样高速度的发展。他说，刚解放时，全新疆只有几个设备简陋的小工厂，现在建立了石油、有色金属、钢铁、机械、电力等大批现代化的工矿企业，小型厂矿更是星罗棋布，遍及城乡。解放初期，新疆粮食产量是二十亿斤，到去年已增长到六十四亿斤，平均每人有粮一千多斤，家家户户丰衣足食。自治区的林业、畜牧业生产也在飞速发展。贾库林代表说：这些辉煌成就，都是和民族团结、和汉族老大哥的无私援助分不开的。特别是人民解放军，对新疆经济建设作了杰出的贡献。他们把三百多万亩荒野变成了绿洲，建立许多机械化国营农场和牧场。生产建设兵团的机械化耕作和先进的农业技术，对新疆各民族农牧民起着深刻的影响。他们在荒凉的戈壁滩上办起大批工厂，在拔海四千公尺的天山上，破冰开山，修筑公路。人民解放军的血汗，洒遍了天山南北，他们和新疆各族人民结下血肉相连的民族友谊。
    贾库林代表说：我们新疆人民像爱护自己生命一样，爱护各民族的团结。帝国主义曾经收买新疆的少数民族败类，如伊敏·艾沙等，打着“民族独立”的幌子破坏祖国统一和民族团结。这种阴谋诡计，已经被彻底粉碎。帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的阴谋，一定遭到可耻的失败！
    云南少数民族的人大代表们，对祖国边疆大跃进的成就，感到十分自豪。在他们家乡，各民族人民实现了民族区域自治之后，正在创造历史上从来没有过的奇迹。仅仅去年上半年，云南边疆地区平均每天就有四十多个中、小厂矿建成并投入生产。有些民族在不久以前手工业还没有从农业中分离出来，现在却在汉族工人帮助下，自制出拖拉机等许多新产品。云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州还用自己生产的设备，建立了拖拉机站。有些少数民族过去用木犁、木耙、木棒进行耕作，年年缺粮依靠国家特殊照顾，去年普遍使用新式农具，学会修水利积肥，使粮食产量翻了几番，自给有余。云南的人大代表谈到这些深刻变化时，指出：各少数民族人民从生活实践中，清楚地知道民族区域自治政策和民族团结政策，是保证各民族共同进步发展的政策；中国共产党和毛主席所指引的道路，是光明幸福的大道。西藏反动集团腐朽透顶，他们背叛祖国，不要民族区域自治，而要帝国主义所封给的“独立”；不要民族团结，而要民族分裂，走上了自取灭亡的绝路，真是“自作孽、不可活”。
    “青海藏族人民在中国共产党的领导下，已经从人间地狱中解放出来。”人大代表札喜旺徐向记者介绍青海的变化时，谈了一些激动人心的情景。他说：青海广大藏区已经摧毁落后、黑暗的封建统治，牧民彻底翻身，并且实现了人民公社化。许多曾经惨遭封建统治阶级剁手、挖眼等种种毒刑伤害的劳苦人民，现在受到了人民公社的关怀和照顾；过去住在野外、没有衣服穿的大批赤贫户，现在住进新帐篷、穿上了新衣服，海北藏族自治州很多地方还盖起瓦房。以贫穷闻名的海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州天峻县，现在平均每人有了八十头牲畜。札喜旺徐说：所有这些进步，是任何人抹煞不了的。事实证明，各少数民族包括藏族在内，必须团结在祖国大家庭里，在党的领导下走社会主义道路，才能够繁荣幸福。西藏反动集团倒行逆施，梦想继续维持最黑暗、反动、残酷的农奴制度，投靠帝国主义和外国反动派，已经成为出卖民族利益和国家利益的罪人。
