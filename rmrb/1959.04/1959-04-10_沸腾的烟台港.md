Booming Yantai Port
        Zhang Xianglin

Spring, the fishing season, and Yantai Port is boiling. Songs and laughter rise and fall, the fleet staff and porters bustle about. An unprecedented bumper fish harvest excites so many!

In the early morning, the sailors' rough shouts disperse the morning mist, summoning the sun's golden rays. In this glow, many fishing boats return laden with their catch, sailing into the harbor; many fishing boats weigh anchor and set sail, braving the waves, heading for deep-sea operations and near-water fishing.

Standing by the sea, the coastline, several miles long, is densely packed with ships; the masts in the foreground are like forests, the sails in the distance like white clouds; seagulls flutter, voices clamor, and the semi-circular bay resembles a thriving water town.

Look, that row of fishing trawlers are unloading fresh fish. This is the Yantai Aquatic Products Company's expedition team. They entered the port at dawn, and now the announcer is reporting in a crisp, joyful voice: a great harvest has been achieved again this morning. It is said that by March 23rd, seventy-four fishing boats had already caught 6,480 tons of fish. On the 19th and 20th, they caught a total of 304 tons, setting a new daily record. What an incredible number!

There comes a sound of "ding-ding-dang-dang, boom-boom-rumble." Ah, by the sea, another huge project is underway. This is the future, magnificent Yantai fishery base. This modern construction will have the latest fish processing machines, huge ice houses, automated processing workshops... In order to support the rapidly developing fisheries production, workers are breaking with convention, with civil engineering and machine installation proceeding simultaneously. Once the base project is completed, the throughput of Yantai Port's fishery products will be greatly enhanced, and people everywhere will eat more fresh fish and prawns.

The east wind is warm, the sunshine is good, and a challenge stage is set up by the sea. The fishermen who want to compete rush onto the stage, publicly announcing their determination and leap forward targets. The competition is fierce, and victory or defeat is difficult to determine. Someone shouts: "Set sail immediately, we'll see who wins when we get back!" In the blink of an eye, the stage is empty, and the boats are moving. The fishermen are determined to stir up the sea, the boats shoot like arrows, and people's hearts are faster than arrows. On the Bohai Sea, sails are dense, advancing with the wind.

Here, a wedding is taking place. A dazzling red "?" character is pasted on the boat, with the sound of sheng and xiao instruments and gongs and drums filling the air. An old fisherman is marrying his daughter to a young fisherman. It was he who, a few years ago, said "I won't marry my daughter to a fisherman," but now his thinking has changed. He said to me: "I have found the most satisfactory son-in-law, he is an advanced worker in marine production, and also a sailor I personally trained. I know him..." As he spoke, he let out a hearty laugh.

Night has fallen, the lights in the port are all lit, the lights on the sea and the stars in the sky are connected as one. Amidst the sound of the water and the night, Yantai Port is again pregnant with a bright, hopeful tomorrow.

    沸腾的烟台港
    张相林
    春天，鱼汛季节，烟台港沸腾起来了。歌声、笑声，此起彼落，船队员工、搬运工，奔忙不停。空前的渔业大丰收，激动着多少人的心！
    清晨，水手们粗犷的?喝声，驱散了晨雾；唤来了太阳的万道金光。在这霞光照耀之中，多少渔船，满载而归，驶进了海港；多少渔船，起锚扬帆，破浪向前，进行远海作业和近水捕捞。
    站在海边，几里长的海岸线，密密麻麻地布满了船只；近处的桅杆像森林，远处的船帆似白云；海鸥翩飞，人声鼎沸，半圆形的海湾，好似一个繁荣的水上市镇。
    你看，那一排渔轮，正在卸着鲜鱼，这是烟台水产公司的远征队，他们是在黎明时进港的，这时广播员正用清脆喜悦的嗓音报告着：今晨又获得了大丰收。听说到3月23日为止，七十四只渔船就已经捕鱼六千四百八十吨，19日和20日两天共捕鱼三百零四吨，创造了日产最高纪录，这是个多么了不起的数字啊！
    那里传来了“叮叮当当，轰轰隆隆”的声音，呵，海边上，又一件巨大的工程正在进行，这是未来的、宏伟壮观的烟台渔业基地。这座现代化的建设，将有最新式的渔产加工机器，巨大的冰房，自动化的加工车间……工人们为了支援迅速发展的渔业生产，打破常规，土木工程和机器安装工程同时进行。基地工程全部竣工以后，烟台港渔产的吞吐量还会大大地增强，各地的人，将会吃到更多的鲜鱼和对虾。
    东风暖，好阳光，擂台摆在海边上。打擂台的渔民，争先恐后地跑上台去，当众宣布自己的决心和跃进指标。擂台打得火热，胜败难分，不知谁喊了声：“马上出海，胜败回头见。”转眼间，擂台上空了，船开动了。渔民们决心闹他个翻江倒海，船像箭离弦，人心比箭快，渤海面上，帆船密集，顺风齐进。
    这里，正在举行婚礼。船上贴着耀眼的大红“?”字，笙箫齐奏，锣鼓喧天。一个老渔民要把自己的女儿嫁给一个年轻的渔民。就是他，在几年前还亲口说过“有女不嫁打渔郎”，可是现在他的这种想法改变了。他对我说：“我找到一个最称心的女婿，他是海洋生产的先进工作者，又是我亲手培养出来的水手，我知道他……。”说着，他发出爽朗的笑声。
    入夜了，港内灯火齐明，海上的灯和天上的星连成一片，水声夜色之中，烟台港又在孕育着一个灿烂的、充满希望的明天。
