　　Arranging Worker Education According to Production Tasks
　　Shanghai Tongyi Hosiery Factory Implements the Policy of Education Serving Production
    (Our dispatch) Shanghai Tongyi Hosiery Factory's spare-time school arranges its teaching work according to the production tasks of each quarter. After a semester of practice, it has been proven that this arrangement not only facilitates the factory's Party committee's leadership over the spare-time school but also fully leverages the initiative of education to serve production.
  Tongyi Hosiery Factory's output this year is to increase by 25% compared to last year, and more than twenty new varieties are to be added. In response to this situation, the factory's Party committee promptly studied this year's production tasks and also summarized last year's experience of the spare-time school promoting production. On this basis, they found a good way to arrange teaching work while determining production tasks. In this way, the factory's production pace is fully aligned with the pace of worker education, and conflicts between production and study time can be avoided.
    Under the unified arrangement of the factory's Party committee, the technical courses in the past three months, in addition to teaching basic production knowledge courses, have also established a technical worker training class for decorating hosiery machines, according to the need to cultivate technical talents. At present, the decorating hosiery machines have not yet arrived in large quantities, but the technicians studying in the training class have already learned the structure and principles of the decorating hosiery machines, as well as mechanical drawing and other courses. A group of veteran workers have learned the skills of disassembling and assembling hosiery machines with more than a thousand parts from the technical courses. Recently, after examination, they can all serve as auxiliary maintenance workers, making up for part of the work of technicians.
    In terms of basic cultural courses, in addition to teaching systematic knowledge, various thematic lectures were held in a planned manner according to the technical innovation projects being prepared for production. For workers who are studying and trial-producing automatic sock removing machines and carding machines, teachers gave them explanations of the basic knowledge of mechanics and physics; to cooperate with the dyeing workshop's project of studying and saving caustic soda consumption, the school taught workers relevant chemical knowledge in advance. The political and language courses also taught texts such as "Combining Soaring Enthusiasm with Scientific Analysis," "Sparks of Life," and "Don't Let a Minute of Heat Go to Waste." Currently, according to the teaching plan and the production tasks for the second quarter, the teachers, together with veteran workers and technicians, have jointly studied and compiled teaching outlines for seven courses, specifically outlining the teaching progress for the next semester, which is closely coordinated with the large-scale technical revolution that the factory will vigorously launch in the second quarter.
    Under the unified arrangement, the contradiction between the factory's production and study time has been resolved more reasonably, and the workers' cultural, recreational, sports activities and rest time have also been guaranteed to a certain extent.

### 按照生产任务安排职工教育  上海统益袜厂贯彻教育为生产服务方针

　　按照生产任务安排职工教育
　　上海统益袜厂贯彻教育为生产服务方针
    本报讯　上海统益袜厂举办的业余学校，按照每个季度的生产任务安排教学工作。经过一个学期的实践证明，这样的安排，不仅便于工厂的党委对业余学校的领导，还可以充分发挥教育为生产服务的主动性。
  统益袜厂今年的产量要比去年增加25％，还要增加二十多种品种。针对这种情况，工厂党委及时研究了今年的生产任务，同时，还总结了去年业余学校促进生产的经验。在这个基础上，找到了在确定生产任务的同时，安排教学工作的好办法。这样，工厂的生产步调与职工教育步调完全合拍，又可以避免生产、学习时间的冲突。
    在工厂党委的统一安排下，3个月来的技术课，除了讲授生产基础知识课程以外，根据培养技术人才的需要，举办了装修花袜机的技工专修班。目前，花袜机还没有大批运到，而在专修班学习的技工们，已经学过了花袜机的结构和原理，以及机械制图等课程。一批老工人从技术课中，已学会了拆装有一千多个零件的织袜机的技能，最近经过考查，他们都可以当辅助保全工，抵上技工的一部分工作。
    在文化基础课程方面，除了讲授系统知识外，根据生产上准备展开技术革新的项目，有计划地举办了各种专题讲座。对于正在研究试制自动脱袜机、卡毛机的工人，教师们向他们作了有关的机械和物理的基本知识讲解；配合漂染车间研究节约烧碱用量的项目，学校对工人们提前讲授了有关的化学知识。政治课、语文课也先后教了“冲天干劲与科学分析相结合”、“生活的火花”“不让一分热量空跑掉”等课文。目前教师们按照教学计划和第二季度的生产任务，同老工人、技工共同研究后，已编写了七门课程的教学大纲，具体地订出了下学期的讲授进度，同第二季度全厂将要大力展开技术革命密切配合进行。
    在统一安排下，工厂的生产和学习时间上的矛盾，得到比较合理的解决，工人的文娱体育活动和休息时间也有了一定的保证。
