    Caring for the Special Needs of Ethnic Minorities
    Sandu Expands the Planting Area of Buckwheat, Indigo, and Other Crops
    Guiyang, April 28th (reported by this newspaper) – Sandu Shui Autonomous County in Guizhou Province is paying attention to arranging the planting of crops specifically needed by the Shui, Miao, and Bouyei peoples during spring planting. The county has planted over 7,000 mu of minor grains such as buckwheat, red rice, millet, and sorghum; and over 5,000 mu of cotton, ramie, and indigo. Sunflower, sesame, peanuts, and beans have also been planted on over 800 mu.
    After liberation, the people of all ethnic groups here have fundamentally shaken off the miserable life of "half a year of bran and vegetable rations." Rice is now the staple food, and they also like to steam nutritious millet cakes and cook buckwheat cakes to change the flavor. During festive occasions, they also eat glutinous rice, red rice, or add fragrant and sweet beans to the rice, and use sunflower seeds, peanuts, and beans to entertain guests. In terms of clothing, the Shui, Miao, and Bouyei farmers in Sandu have always relied on planting cotton and ramie and weaving their own cloth. Since these three ethnic groups prefer blue and indigo colors for their clothing and decorations, they have a relatively urgent need for indigo.
    In the past, it was difficult to fully take care of these special needs in life. But today, with the establishment of communes, the needs of ethnic minorities are being met to a greater extent. When formulating production plans, in addition to completing the planting tasks according to the state plan, the production teams of each commune also include various crops that are not large in quantity but needed by ethnic minority people into the plan, adapting to local conditions. For example, some elderly people like to smoke a bag of homegrown tobacco after work, so the county has arranged to plant 505 mu of native tobacco for the use of commune members. Regarding cotton, ramie, and indigo, each commune has also expanded the planting area based on the state's instructions to vigorously develop cash crops and the needs of local ethnic minority farmers. Last year, the county only planted 10,000 mu of cotton, but now it has increased to 35,000 mu. With the support of other provinces, all of it has been changed to the excellent Dai-character cotton seeds, striving to make Sandu one of the main cotton-producing counties in the mountainous areas of Guizhou. The planned planting area for ramie this year is 11,500 mu, which is also more than last year.

### 照顾少数民族特殊需要  三都扩大了荞子、蓝靛等作物的播种面积

    照顾少数民族特殊需要
    三都扩大了荞子、蓝靛等作物的播种面积
    本报贵阳28日电　贵州省三都水族自治县在春播中注意安排种植水、苗、布依等族人民生活特殊需要的作物。全县共计播种荞子、红米、小米、高粱等小杂粮七千多亩；共种下棉花、青麻、蓝靛等五千多亩；葵花、芝麻、花生和豆子也播了八百多亩。
    这里的各族人民在解放后已经根本摆脱了糠菜半年粮的悲惨生活，日常以大米为主粮，有时也爱用营养丰富的小米蒸糕，用荞麦煮粑，换换口味，每逢喜庆节日，还要吃顿糯米饭、红米饭，或者在饭里加一些又香又甜的豆子，并且用葵花子、花生、豆子招待客人。在衣着方面，三都的水族、苗族、布依族农民一向是依靠种棉花和青麻，自纺自织来解决的。由于这三个民族的衣饰都喜爱青、蓝两色，他们对蓝靛有比较迫切的需要。
    这种生活上的特殊需要，在过去是很难全面照顾的。但是在公社化了的今天，少数民族的需要得到了更大限度的满足。公社的各个生产队在订生产计划时，除了按照国家计划完成种植任务外，还因地制宜地把各种数量不大但又为少数民族人民需要的作物列入计划。例如有些老年人喜欢在干活后抽一袋叶子烟，全县就安排种土烟五百零五亩，供社员自用。对于棉花、青麻和蓝靛等，各公社根据国家大力发展经济作物的指示，和当地少数民族农民的需要，也扩大了种植面积。去年全县只种棉花一万亩，现在增加到三万五千亩，并且在外省支援下，全部改用了优良的岱字棉种，力争使三都成为贵州山区主要产棉县之一。青麻今年计划播种一万一千五百亩，也比去年多。
