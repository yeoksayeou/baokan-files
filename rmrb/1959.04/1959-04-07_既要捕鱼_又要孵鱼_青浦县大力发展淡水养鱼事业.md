Both Fish Catching and Fish Hatching
Qingpu County Vigorously Develops Freshwater Fish Farming

This newspaper, Shanghai, 6th dispatch. Qingpu County, Shanghai, is making great efforts to develop freshwater fish farming by utilizing its advantageous condition of having abundant water surfaces.

Located in the Jiangnan water region, Qingpu County has 360,000 mu of water surface out of a total area of 960,000 mu. Qingpu County has been famous for producing freshwater fish, and nearly half of the black carp, grass carp, silver carp, and bream consumed in Shanghai each year come from here. This year, in order to better meet the needs of urban and rural people, invigorate the commune economy, and increase commune members' income, the county has decided to make full use of its advantageous water area conditions to vigorously develop the aquaculture industry, striving to increase the total fish production from about 180,000 dan last year to 1,200,000 dan.

Developing freshwater fish farming, first of all, requires solving the problem of fish fry. To this end, in addition to sending people to purchase fish fry from other places, Qingpu County mainly relies on self-reliance and artificial fish hatching. As early as last winter, the county combined water conservancy construction with manure accumulation to dig a large number of fish ponds and clean up the fish ponds for carp spawning and hatching. In order to solve the shortage of technical personnel, Shanghai Fisheries College and the Aquatic Products Company also helped them to run hatching technology training classes, training more than 260 hatching technicians in total. The Jiefang (Liberation) Commune also adopted the method of masters leading apprentices, and trained more than 80 new fish fry hatching hands through on-site operations.

Although the fishermen of Qingpu County have been fishing in lakes and ponds for generations, they have never engaged in artificial fish hatching. Many people had never even heard of it. They said, "We've only heard of hatching chickens and ducks, never heard of hatching fish fry." But this year they broke the routine and succeeded. In mid-March, as the temperature rose, the members of the Jiefang Commune paired carp into groups according to proportions of males and females, and put them into the hatching pond. After seven or eight days, they laid more than 100 million eggs, and the first batch of fish eggs hatched more than 30 million fry. If the weather does not change drastically, the fish fry will continue to hatch, and the egg production will also increase day by day.

### 既要捕鱼　又要孵鱼  青浦县大力发展淡水养鱼事业

    既要捕鱼　又要孵鱼
    青浦县大力发展淡水养鱼事业
    本报上海6日电　上海市青浦县利用水面多的有利条件，大力发展淡水养鱼事业。
    地处江南水乡的青浦县，全县九十六万亩面积，水面就占去了三十六万亩。青浦县向以出产淡水鱼闻名，上海市每年吃到的青鱼、草鱼、鲢鱼、鳊鱼，近半数出在这里。今年该县为了更好的满足城乡人民的需要，活跃公社经济，增加社员收入，决定利用该县水面多的有利条件，大力发展养殖事业，争取鱼的总产量从去年的十八万担左右提高到一百二十万担。
    发展淡水养鱼，首先要解决鱼种问题。为此，青浦县除了派人到外地去采购外，主要是靠自力更生人工孵鱼。早在去年冬天，该县就结合兴修水利和积肥，开挖大批鱼池，并清理鱼塘，以供鲤鱼产卵孵化之用。为了解决技术力量的不足，上海水产学院和水产公司，也帮助他们举办了孵化技术训练班，前后共培训了二百六十多名孵化技术人员。解放公社还采取了师傅带徒弟的方法，通过现场操作，培养了八十多个新的鱼苗孵化手。
    青浦县的渔民们，虽然世世代代在湖塘里捕鱼，但他们都没搞过人工孵鱼。不少人听也没听到过。他们说：“只听见孵鸡鸭，没听见孵鱼苗”。但他们今年打破常规搞成功了。3月中旬，气温回升，解放公社的社员们，把鲤鱼按比例将雌雄搭配成组，投入孵化池。七、八天后就产卵一亿多只，第一批鱼卵已孵化出鱼苗三千多万尾。如天气无大变化，鱼苗将陆续孵化出来，同时产卵量也将一天天多起来。
