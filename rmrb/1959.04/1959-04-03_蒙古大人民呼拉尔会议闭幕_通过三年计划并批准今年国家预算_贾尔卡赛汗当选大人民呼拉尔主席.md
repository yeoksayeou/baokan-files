The plenary session criticized some shortcomings within the Party that were detrimental to the cause of the Party and the people, further strengthened the Party's unity, and strengthened the Party's ties with the masses of the people.

In recent years, the Party and the state have taken many measures to develop agricultural and pastoral production and carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry. At present, agricultural and pastoral cooperation has been basically realized throughout the country. The socialist relations of production in agriculture and animal husbandry are being consolidated day by day, and the mechanization of agricultural and pastoral production is also being gradually realized.
