From 1956 onwards, in a short period of two to three years, half a billion farmers expanded the area of national arable land with irrigation works from over 500 million mu to over 1.3 billion mu. This is an unprecedented miracle in the history of water conservancy construction. Is everything alright once the project is completed? Absolutely not. What is more important is to cherish this great achievement of labor and give full play to the "benefit" of "water." Jiangsu Province's approach of "repairing one place well, managing one place well, and using one place well" in water conservancy projects is worth promoting. Carrying out technical innovation movements, improving irrigation systems, giving full play to the potential of projects and equipment, saving labor and water, and irrigating in a timely and appropriate manner are even more worthy of universal promotion. Water conservancy is built for utilization. Without utilization, there is no "benefit." If used well, you can get double the "benefit" - one project can play the role of two identical projects, and one set of equipment can play the role of two sets of equipment. In terms of water utilization, we must show the same, or even greater, enthusiasm as we did in water conservancy construction, and work hard, practically, and cleverly.

　　“水”和“利”
    从1956年算起，五亿农民在短短两三年内，使全国耕地有水利工程可以灌溉的面积从五亿多亩扩大到十三亿多亩。这在水利建设史上是史无前例的奇迹。工程修好了，是不是就万事大吉了呢？决不是的。更重要的是十分珍重这伟大的劳动成果，使“水”充分地发挥它的“利”。江苏省在水利工程上采取“修好一处，管好一处，用好一处”的做法，是值得提倡的。开展技术革新运动，改进灌溉制度，充分发挥工程和设备的潜力，省工省水，适时适量灌溉，更是值得普遍推行的。兴修水利，原是为了利用。不利用，就无“利”可言。利用得好，还可以得到加倍的“利”——一个工程可以发挥两个同样的工程的作用，一套设备可以发挥两套设备的作用。在利用水方面，一定要拿出同修水利一样高的甚至更高的劲头来，苦干实干巧干。
