Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, was born in 1893. He studied at the universities of Berlin, Kiel, and Göttingen. In 1918, he joined the German People's Party and later served as its General Secretary. From 1929 to 1933, he was a member of the Saxon Parliament.

Dieckmann was a loyal democrat and patriot who opposed fascism. Consequently, he was not tolerated by the Hitler regime and later went to work in the Saxon coal mines.

After the defeat of the Hitler regime, Dieckmann was one of the first figures dedicated to building a new democratic Germany. He initially engaged in economic work in Saxony, where he established the first state-owned economic enterprise – the Saxon Coal Mining Bureau in Dresden.

Dieckmann was one of the founders of the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany, established in 1945. Later, he served as the party's vice-chairman. In 1946, he ran for parliament as a candidate of the Free Democratic Party and was elected as a member of the Saxon Parliament.

As early as 1948, Dieckmann was a member of the Saxon state government. He served as Minister of Justice and Deputy Prime Minister of Saxony.

In October 1949, the German Democratic Republic was founded, and Dieckmann was elected as the Chairman of the Provisional People's Chamber. Since then, he has served in this position with outstanding talent and superb experience.

Dieckmann firmly believes that only the unity of all anti-fascist parties and groups can complete the arduous task of building a better society. He also firmly believes that due to the growing strength and unity of the working class, and the tasks it undertook in the struggle against Hitler, they should assume a leading role. Therefore, he actively participated in the establishment and strengthening of the anti-fascist democratic party bloc.

Dieckmann is one of the initiators of the German-Soviet Friendship Association. He is a member of the Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic and the head of the Permanent Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the "International Conference on Peaceful Resolution of the German Question." He firmly opposes militarism and fully supports peaceful coexistence and cooperation between countries.

Due to Dr. Dieckmann's merits, he has been awarded prestigious medals on several occasions, including the Gold Medal of National Merit and other medals and awards. (Attached picture)
