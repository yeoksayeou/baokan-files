Xinhua News Agency, London, April 18th. The Sino-British Friendship Association held its annual meeting today. The meeting passed resolutions on the issue of restoring China's seat in the United Nations and the Tibet issue, and decided to launch activities to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

This association was founded in 1949 and has now been in existence for ten years.

Dr. Jueres, Chairman of the Association, delivered the annual report at the meeting. He said that through the association's activities, hundreds of thousands of people have a better understanding of China and Sino-British relations. Through activities such as sending delegations, providing speakers, holding exhibitions, and showing films, the association has established contacts with hundreds of industrial and artistic organizations and institutions. Jueres said that the achievements China has made in the past ten years have surprised the world. He said, "We extend our heartfelt congratulations to it (China). We know that when the enormous increase in global human wealth and happiness is calculated at the end of this century, it will be found that China will be one of the largest contributors."

Reviewing the relations between the Chinese and British governments, Jueres pointed out that this relationship has not improved in the past year. Britain still does not support China's restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations and is helping to promote the historically unfounded idea of "two Chinas." Jueres said, "The association needs to further strengthen its activities in order to win broad public opinion on these two matters, to influence the government to abandon its current attitude and support a more realistic policy."

The meeting unanimously passed a resolution expressing regret over the following: The Chinese people are not represented in the United Nations, while Chiang Kai-shek's elements in Taiwan still illegally occupy China's seat; some places (including Britain) are vigorously promoting the erroneous concept of "two Chinas." The resolution calls on the British government to take active measures to ease world tensions and to propose recognition of the People's Republic of China at this year's UN General Assembly.

The conference unanimously passed a resolution on the Tibet issue. The resolution stated, "Tibet is an inalienable part of China." The resolution pointed out the Chinese government's patient waiting attitude towards the former Tibetan local government on the issue of social reform in Tibet, and the Tibetan rebels' opposition to any social reform. The resolution stated, "This annual meeting is fully convinced that the Chinese Central People's Government has been and will continue to strive to resolve all issues related to Tibet in accordance with its peaceful and progressive policy towards ethnic minorities - helping the people's economic, social and cultural development, and respecting their religious beliefs and customs."

The meeting announced that it would hold special celebrations to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Sino-British Friendship Association. The celebrations will include a large-scale photo exhibition reflecting the lives of the Chinese people, an exhibition of Chinese handicrafts, screenings of Chinese films, lectures on China, concerts by Chinese artists, and other social activities.

Qin Jialin, Counselor of the Chinese Representative Office in Britain, delivered a speech at the meeting. He praised the leaders and members of the Sino-British Friendship Association for their firm maintenance and development of the friendship between the Chinese and British people over the past ten years.

### 英中友协年会就西藏问题通过决议说  西藏是中国不可分割的一部分

　　英中友协年会就西藏问题通过决议说
　　西藏是中国不可分割的一部分
    新华社伦敦18日电　英中友好协会今天举行年会。会议就恢复中国在联合国席位问题和西藏问题通过了决议，并且决定展开庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年的活动。
    这个协会是在1949年成立的，到现在已经十年了。
    协会主席裘尔斯博士在会上作了年度报告。他说，通过协会的活动，几十万人对中国、对英中关系有了更好的了解。通过派遣代表团、提供讲演人、举办展览会和放映电影等活动，协会同数以百计的工业和艺术方面的组织和机构建立了联系。裘尔斯说，中国在近十年来所取得的成就使全世界吃惊。他说，“我们向它（中国）致以衷心的祝贺。我们知道，到了这个世纪末来计算一下全世界人类财富和幸福的巨大增长的时候，人们将会发现，中国将是贡献最大的国家之一。”
    裘尔斯在回顾中英两国政府的关系时指出，这种关系在过去一年中没有改善。英国仍然不支持中国恢复在联合国的合法席位，并且正在帮助促进毫无历史根据的“两个中国”的想法。裘尔斯说，“协会还需要进一步加强它的活动，以便在这两件事情上争取到广泛的舆论，来影响政府放弃目前的态度，支持一个比较现实的政策。”
    会议一致通过决议，对下述情况表示遗憾：中国人民在联合国还没有代表，而台湾蒋介石分子仍然窃据着中国的席位；一些地方（包括英国）有人正在大事宣传可以有“两个中国”的错误观念。决议要求英国政府采取积极措施来缓和世界紧张局势，并且在今年的联合国大会上提议承认中华人民共和国。
    大会一致通过了关于西藏问题的决议。决议说，“西藏是中国不可分割的一部分”。决议指出了中国政府在西藏社会改革问题上对原西藏地方政府的耐心等待态度以及西藏叛乱分子反对任何社会改革。决议说，“这次年会完全相信，中国中央人民政府已经并且将继续努力按照它的和平和进步的少数民族政策——帮助人民的经济、社会和文化发展以及尊重他们的宗教信仰和风俗习惯——来解决同西藏有关的一切问题。”
    会议宣布将举行特别的庆祝活动，来庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年以及英中友好协会成立十周年。庆祝活动将包括反映中国人民生活的大规模图片展览，中国手工艺品展览，放映中国影片，举办关于中国的演讲会、中国艺术家的音乐会和其它社会活动。
    中国驻英代办处参赞秦加林在会上致词。他赞扬英中友好协会的领导人和会员们在过去十年里一直坚决维护了和发展了中英两国人民之间的友谊。
