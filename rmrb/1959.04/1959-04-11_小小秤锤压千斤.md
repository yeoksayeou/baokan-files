　　A Small Weighing Ballast Presses Down a Thousand Catties
　　One characteristic of small farm tools is their size. Because of their small size, they are often easily overlooked. In fact, although they are small in stature, they play a significant role and have a wide range of uses. A small weighing ballast presses down a thousand catties. We should not simply disregard anything just because it is small.
　　Another characteristic of small farm tools is their dispersal. Because of their dispersal, there are certain difficulties in repair and maintenance. These difficulties can be overcome. For example, the problem can be solved by organizing rural blacksmiths and carpenters into groups, going to the production teams to offer repair services, and even going to the fields to make repairs.
