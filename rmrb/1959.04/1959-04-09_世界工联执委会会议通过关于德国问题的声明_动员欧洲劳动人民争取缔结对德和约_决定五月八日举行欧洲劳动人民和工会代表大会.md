Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 6th. The 19th meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which opened here on April 2nd, successfully concluded this afternoon. The meeting passed the following documents: Resolution on the Tasks of Trade Unions in the Struggle for Peace; Statement on the German Question; Letter to All German Workers; Resolution on the Struggle of Working People to Develop Economic and Social Demands; Statement on the Persecution of Sudanese Trade Unions; Letter to the Cuban Workers and Trade Unions; and Statement on the Cyprus Question.

The meeting continued its discussion on the second, third, and fourth items on the agenda today.

World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary Bratt made a concluding speech on the second and third items on the agenda. He also suggested that the recent conference on propaganda work held in Prague be submitted to the regular meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee for discussion.

World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary Ma Chun-ku made a report on the regular meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council. He put forward the suggestion of the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions: to hold a regular meeting of the Council in Beijing in April 1960, and to hold the 20th meeting of the Executive Committee at the end of 1959. The meeting passed this suggestion.

The meeting also heard and discussed the report of World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary Casadei on the 1959 budget and the suggestion of World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant on electing an African trade union representative as Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Executive Committee elected Sudanese trade union representative Zakaria as Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 7th. The 19th meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions passed a statement on the German question.

The statement mentioned the general resolution of the First World Trade Union Congress held fourteen years ago. That resolution clarified the position of the working people on the German question.

The statement said that the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions noted with satisfaction that the recommendations of the First World Trade Union Congress and the Potsdam Agreement it supported have been thoroughly implemented in the part of Germany under Soviet responsibility. There, workers and peasants have established their own democratic republic and are now building a peaceful socialist society.

The statement pointed out that, on the contrary, these recommendations and the Potsdam Agreement have been completely ignored in the part of Germany under the responsibility of the United States, Britain, and France. In this part of Germany, monopoly capital and aggressive German militarism have restored their power, established a militarist state linked to the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, established a new aggressive army, and openly put forward various territorial demands.

In accordance with the principles of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and expressing the concerns of millions of workers in Germany and Europe, the Executive Committee believes that:

	——The Berlin issue should be resolved peacefully;
	——The Four Powers should conclude a peace treaty with Germany, taking into account the recommendations of the First World Trade Union Congress;
	——Western countries and the Bonn government should recognize the German Democratic Republic of workers and peasants;
	——The peaceful reunification of Germany, in line with the interests and wishes of the German people and the people of Europe, must be considered an internal affair of the Germans themselves. This unification can be achieved by establishing a confederation of the two German states, respecting the victories of the German working class and considering their interests.

The statement said that it is possible and necessary to mobilize the workers and trade unions of Europe to carry out a united struggle to achieve this goal. In order to achieve success in this regard, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions decided to hold a European Labor and Trade Union Congress for a Peace Treaty with Germany, Disarmament and Prohibition of Atomic Weapons in Görlitz, on the Oder-Neisse border, from May 8th to 10th this year.

The Executive Committee calls on all workers in Germany and Europe to work together to crush the conspiracies of the warmongers and ensure the success of this important congress.

The Executive Committee once again expresses its full solidarity with all German workers and trade unions, in support of their struggle against the policies of the German reactionary forces and for the establishment of a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany.

    世界工联执委会会议通过关于德国问题的声明
    动员欧洲劳动人民争取缔结对德和约
    决定五月八日举行欧洲劳动人民和工会代表大会
    新华社华沙6日电　于4月2日在这里开幕的世界工会联合会执行委员会第十九次会议今天下午胜利闭幕。会议通过了下列文件：关于工会在争取和平斗争中的任务的决议；关于德国问题的声明；致全德劳动人民书；关于劳动人民开展争取经济和社会要求的斗争的决议；关于苏丹工会遭受迫害的声明；致古巴劳动人民和工会书和关于塞浦路斯问题的声明等。
    会议今天继续就第二、第三和第四项议程进行了讨论。
    世界工联书记布拉就第二和第三项议程作了总结发言。他还建议最近在布拉格召开宣传工作会议，并把这个问题提交世界工联执行委员会例会讨论。
    世界工联书记马纯古作了关于世界工联理事会例会的报告。他提出了世界工联书记处的建议：于1960年4月在北京举行理事会例会，在1959年底举行执行委员会第二十次会议。会议通过了这个建议。
    会议还听取和讨论了世界工联书记卡萨台关于1959年预算的报告和世界工联总书记赛扬关于选举一名非洲工会代表为世界工联书记处书记的建议。执行委员会选举了苏丹工会代表扎卡里亚为世界工联书记处书记。
    新华社华沙7日电　世界工会联合会执行委员会第十九次会议通过了关于德国问题的声明。
    声明中提到十四年前举行的第一次世界工会大会的总决议。那个决议中阐明了劳动人民在德国问题上的立场。
    声明说，世界工联执行委员会满意地指出，第一次世界工会大会的建议和它所支持的波茨坦协定在由苏联负责的那部分德国领土上已经彻底实现了。在那里，工人和农民已建立了自己的民主共和国，现在正在建设和平的社会主义社会。
    声明指出，与此相反的是，这些建议和波茨坦协定在美、英、法负责的那部分德国领土上却完全遭到了忽视。在这部分德国领土上，垄断资本和侵略性的德国军国主义恢复了自己的政权，建立了与侵略性的北大西洋公约组织有联系的军国主义国家，建立了一支新的侵略军队，并且公开提出种种领土要求。
    本着世界工联的原则，并表达德国和欧洲千百万劳动人民的忧虑，执行委员会认为：
    ——柏林问题应该和平解决；
  ——四大国应该在考虑第一次世界工会大会建议的情况下缔结对德和约；
    ——西方国家和波恩政府应该承认工农的德意志民主共和国；
    ——在符合德国人民和欧洲各国人民利益和愿望的情况下和平统一德国，这必须认为是德国人自己的内部事务。可以用下列办法达到这种统一：在尊重德国工人阶级的胜利果实和考虑其利益的条件下建立两个德国的邦联。
    声明说，可以而且必须动员欧洲劳动人民和工会，使他们进行一致的斗争来达到这一目的。为了在这方面取得成就，世界工联执行委员会决定今年5月8日至10日在奥得—尼斯国界线上的格利茨城举行欧洲劳动人民和工会争取缔结对德和约、裁军和禁止原子武器大会。
    执行委员会号召德国和欧洲的全体劳动人民共同努力来粉碎战争狂人的阴谋并保证这次重要的大会的成功。
    执行委员会再次对全体德国劳动人民和工会表示充分的声援，声援他们为反对德国反动势力的政策和争取建立和平民主的统一的德国而进行的斗争。
