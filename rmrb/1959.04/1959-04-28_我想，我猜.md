	“I Think, I Guess…”
	Zheng Yin
	After having a "four-hour talk with the Dalai Lama," Nehru finally had to admit that the three letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan were genuine. Mr. Nehru had twice publicly expressed doubts about these letters, questioning "whether these letters were really written" and finding "these letters to be quite surprising." Denying the authenticity of these letters was aimed at denying what the Dalai Lama said in the letters and denying that the Dalai Lama was abducted by traitors. Mr. Nehru had said: "To say that the Dalai Lama was forced to do something, to say that the Dalai Lama is in fact complaining about the very people who revere him, seems very strange to me." Now, the truth is out. Mr. Nehru's doubts were unfounded, the three letters are genuine, and it is also true that those "very reverent" traitors forced and abducted the Dalai Lama.

	However, regarding the reason for writing the letters, Nehru said: "He (the Dalai Lama) admitted that he wrote them for two reasons. But the main reason is – I think, I guess, I didn’t ask him – that his situation at the time was very difficult."

	This is truly a "strange statement." Since it is "I think, I guess, I didn't ask him," how can it be proven that "he admitted" it? Besides, thinking and guessing are common occurrences for a person; thinking and guessing, wanting to tell others is up to them. However, to say that someone "admitted" something based on what you thought and guessed, without even asking the person himself, is somewhat inappropriate, isn't it a bit like imposing on others? Out of respect for Mr. Nehru, I cannot bear to think or guess any further, and therefore I am unwilling to say more about what impression his actions might give.

	Here, I would also like to talk about the so-called "his situation at the time was very difficult." The Dalai Lama's difficult situation at the time was clearly written in the three letters, and Mr. Nehru, who is very familiar with the inside story of Tibet, naturally knew this a long time ago. However, outsiders may not be so clear, so let me briefly explain.

	The Dalai Lama's situation was very difficult at the time, as evidenced by the following facts: The Dalai Lama's mother said at the time: "The Dalai now has no power or freedom, it's terrible, what to do?"

	A guard of the Dalai Lama, Bai Ma Qiongpei, said: "After the 1st of the Tibetan calendar month, the four main gates of Norbulingka were closed, leaving only side doors for entry and exit. Traitors guarded the side doors, not allowing outsiders to enter. During this period, the Dalai Lama could only walk around in his own courtyard and could not go outside the courtyard."

	Zi Zhong Ju Ma Losang Duoji said: "At that time, there was a decision made at the meeting: First, the Dalai Lama cannot walk around freely except for the upper and lower halls and the Da Kun Temple..."

	Just as the Dalai Lama's mother said, it had reached the point where "as long as they don't kill you, it's fine," isn't this difficult? It was precisely because it was so difficult that letters could only be secretly brought in and out; it was precisely because it was so difficult that the letter said: "Reactionary bad elements are using the excuse of protecting my safety to carry out activities that endanger me." That is why, in the letter the day before he was abducted, it was said: "The situation inside and outside here... is still very difficult to deal with." This very difficult situation of the Dalai Lama is the specific circumstance of the Dalai Lama being abducted. Has Mr. Nehru "thought" about this fact?

    “我想，我猜……”
    郑因
    尼赫鲁在“同达赖喇嘛举行了长达四小时的谈话以后”，终于不得不承认达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封信是真的。尼赫鲁先生曾经两次公开表示怀疑这些信，认为“是不是真的写了这些信”，认为“这些信是颇为令人惊讶的”。否认这些信是真实的，是为了否认达赖喇嘛信中所说的话，否认叛国分子劫持达赖喇嘛。尼赫鲁先生说过：“说达赖喇嘛被迫做某种事情的，说达赖喇嘛事实上在抱怨他自己的非常崇敬他的人，这在我看来是一种很奇怪的说法。”现在，真相大白，尼赫鲁先生的怀疑是没有根据的，三封信是真的，那些“非常崇敬”达赖喇嘛的叛国分子强迫和劫持达赖喇嘛也是真的。
    不过关于写信的原因，尼赫鲁说：“他（达赖喇嘛）承认由于两个原因，他给他们写了信。但是主要的原因是——我想，我猜，我没有问他——当时他的处境非常困难。”
    这才真是一种“奇怪的说法”。既然是“我想，我猜，我没有问他”，又怎能证明是“他承认”了的呢？再说，随便想想、猜猜，原是一个人常有的事；想了，猜了，要向人说也只好听便，不过把自己所想所猜，连问也没有问本人一声，就说人家“承认”了，未免欠妥当吧，这不是有些强加于人吗？为了尊重尼赫鲁先生，我不忍再去想，去猜，因而也不愿再说，他的这种作法会给人什么印象。
    这里还要谈谈所谓“当时他的处境非常困难”。达赖喇嘛当时的处境困难，在三封信里已经写得清清楚楚，对于非常熟悉西藏内幕的尼赫鲁先生来说，自然是早就清楚的了。但局外人却未必如此清楚，所以要简单的说一说。
    达赖喇嘛当时的处境很困难，还有如下事实为证：达赖喇嘛的母亲当时说：“达赖现在没有权力和自由了，真糟糕，怎么办？”
    达赖的一个警卫员白玛穷培说：“藏历2月1日以后，罗布林卡四面大门紧闭，只留侧门出入。侧门口有叛匪看守，不准外人进入。达赖在这期间，只能在他自己住的院子里转转，不能到院子外边去。”
    孜仲居玛洛桑多吉说：“当时会上曾有这样的决定：第一、达赖喇嘛除上下两殿和大昆寺以外，不能随意行走……。”
    正像达赖喇嘛母亲所说的那样，当时已经到了“只要他们不把你杀掉就好了”的程度，这还不困难吗？正是因为有这样困难，所以信才只能由人秘密地带进带出；正是因为有这样的困难，所以信上才说到：“反动的坏分子们正在借口保护我的安全而进行着危害我的活动。”所以才在临被劫走前一天的那封信上说到：“现在此间内外的情况……仍很难处置”。达赖喇嘛这种非常困难的处境，也就是达赖喇嘛被劫持的具体情况。尼赫鲁先生有没有“想”到这个事实呢？
