　　Old Man and Youth Compete for Championship
　　At the second crow of the rooster, Yu Qingtao (a member of the Communist Youth League), the leader of the youth rice transplanting team of the Ninth Production Team of Jia Yi Commune in Pingjiang, Hunan, got out of bed and gently woke up the young team member Yu Cundong. Then, the two of them separately woke up five team members and headed towards the rice paddies by the Yikou River along the winding path.
　　Why did the youth rice transplanting team get up so early? It turned out that this team was competing with the "Huang Zhong" team and the women's team. Yesterday's competition resulted in the youth team getting second place, and the red flag was snatched by the "Huang Zhong" team. The young people, of course, refused to admit defeat. After the evaluation meeting, the youth team members discussed together: "The old generals rely on skills, we rely on hard work, we must seize the red flag." The young men were all full of energy and planned to fight at night. Unexpectedly, the cadre Yu Junde discovered and stopped them. Since they couldn't fight at night, they had to go to the field early.
　　The old generals didn't sleep in; they headed to the rice paddies before dawn. "Oh no!" Yu E'ren, the leader of the "Huang Zhong" team, was taken aback when he saw a group of figures in the distance. When they got closer, they saw that each member of the youth team had already pulled 140 or 150 seedlings. At this time, the women's team also set out, with laughter and singing coming from time to time. In an instant, the fields were boiling with activity.
　　As soon as the old generals arrived in the rice paddies, they worked hard. In pulling seedlings, the "kids" were obviously ahead, but they wanted to make up for it in transplanting in order to keep the red flag. They kept rushing back and forth like "dragonflies skimming the water," forgetting even to smoke and drink tea. One field was completely transplanted in one morning. Seeing the energy of the old generals, the young men in the youth team also kept cheering each other on. Near noon, the youth team leader took the opportunity to carry seedlings and "reconnoitered" everywhere. "Oh dear!" He was a little surprised. Each member of the "Huang Zhong" team had transplanted nearly one mu of rice, while each member of his own team had transplanted less than eight fen. Even the women's team had transplanted more than seven fen per person. When he returned, during the lunch break, several people squatted on the edge of the field to discuss countermeasures. They decided to adopt "shuttle weaving rice," transplanting alternately left and right; and learned from the women's team to tie seedling baskets to their feet to save time. In addition, they borrowed two native carts from the team to transport seedlings, which could carry 400 bundles at a time, greatly saving transportation time.
　　In the afternoon, the competition became even more lively. The youth team, due to adopting some new measures, was full of confidence in winning the red flag and doubled its efforts. The "Huang Zhong" team did not give in and wanted to keep the red flag. The women's team was not to be outdone and strived to be upstream. As the sun was setting, the competition entered a tense decisive stage. At this time, several transplanting teams were neck and neck, and everyone wanted to win the red flag in the final moments.
　　It was getting dark, and the production team leader began to inspect and accept the work field by field. He measured the row spacing and plant spacing, and checked the number of roots per clump, all of which met the standards. He nodded repeatedly, feeling satisfied. "Da da di..." The signal for the end of work sounded, but people were still reluctant to leave the rice paddies, still transplanting! Still rushing! So they had to blow the second and third signals for the end of work.
　　That night, the evaluation results showed that the youth team had transplanted an average of 1.65 mu of rice per person, winning the championship. The "Huang Zhong" team transplanted an average of 1.56 mu of rice per person, temporarily in second place. The women's team was also efficient, transplanting an average of 1.5 mu of rice per person. After the evaluation meeting, people were brewing for the next day's competition.

　　老汉青年争冠军
    鸡叫二遍，湖南平江加义公社第九生产队青年插秧组组长喻清桃（团员），从床上爬起后，轻轻地把青年社员喻存冬叫了起来。然后，两人又分头叫起五个组员，沿着湾曲的小路，向义口河边的秧田走去。
    青年插秧组为什么起得这样早？原来这个组跟“黄忠”组、妇女组开展了竞赛。昨天竞赛结果，青年组得了第二名，红旗被“黄忠”组夺去了。青年人当然不服输。评比会后，青年组的组员们在一起商量：“老将们凭技术，我们凭干劲，一定要把红旗夺到手。”小伙子们个个精神抖擞，打算来个夜战。不料，被干部喻俊德发觉阻止了。夜战不成，只好提早下田。
    老将们并没有睡大觉，不等天亮，也向秧田走去。“糟了！”“黄忠”组组长喻峨仁远远地望见一群人影，心里不觉吃了一惊。等他们走近一看，青年组每人已扯秧一百四五十把。这时，妇女组也出动了，不时传来笑声和歌声。顷刻间，田野里就沸腾起来了。
    老将们一到秧田里，就紧张地干了起来。在扯秧上，显然是“毛孩子”领先了，但他们想在插秧上补救，以便保住红旗。他们一来一往“蜻蜓点水”似地不断往前赶，连抽烟、吃茶都忘记了。一个上午，一丘田就全部插完。青年组的小伙子看到老将们这股劲头，也在不断地加油。快到中午时分，青年组长趁挑秧的机会，到处“侦察”一番。“哎呀！”他不觉有点吃惊。“黄忠”组每人插秧近一亩，而自己组里每人还不到八分。就连妇女组每人也插到七分多。他回来后，趁中午休息时，几个人就蹲在田坳上商量对策。决定采取插“梭布禾”，左右轮插；又从妇女组那里学来脚系秧篓，以节省时间。另外又从队里借来两部土车运秧，一次可运四百把，大大节省了运秧时间。
    下午，竞赛更热闹了。青年组由于采取了一些新措施，夺红旗的信心十足，干劲倍增。“黄忠”组一步不让，要保住红旗。妇女组也不甘示弱，力争上游。太阳快落山了，竞赛进入紧张的决战阶段。这时，几个插秧组不相上下，谁都想在最后的时刻里夺得红旗。
    天快黑了，生产队长开始逐丘检查验收。他量量行距株距，又查看每丛的根数，都合乎标准，他连连点头，感到满意。“哒哒嘀……”收工的号声响了，可是人们还舍不得离开秧田，仍在插呀！赶呀！于是又不得不吹起第二次、第三次的收工号。
    当晚评比结果，青年组每人平均插秧一亩六分五，夺得冠军。“黄忠”组每人平均插秧一亩五分六，暂居亚军。妇女组效率也不低，每人平均插秧一亩五分。评比会后，人们又在酝酿着第二天的竞赛。
