Xinhua News Agency, April 28th, Tokyo: The National Conference to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," composed of more than 140 Japanese organizations, passed a statement at its plenary meeting held in Tokyo today, calling on all Japanese people to unite immediately and launch a united action to fight to the end to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke government from forcibly revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The statement pointed out that all forces united in the National Conference must thoroughly expose the traitorous nature of the Kishi Nobusuke government and its conspiracy to forcibly revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and strive to win the victory of the democratic forces in the upcoming House of Councillors election.

The statement emphasized that only by not participating in any military bloc and taking the path of independent autonomy can Japan's security be guaranteed. Therefore, the Japanese people must further shatter the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" system on the basis of launching the struggle to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution on advocating a campaign to support the Tokyo District Court's ruling that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" violates the Constitution.

The resolution called on the masses to pass resolutions supporting this ruling at all gatherings and to severely condemn the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to overturn this ruling. The resolution stated that in order to strive for the Supreme Court to uphold the Tokyo District Court's ruling, a unified lawyer defense team should be immediately prepared, and support activities such as fundraising should be launched.

The meeting also adopted the current action plan. The plan stipulates that May 16th will be the "Second National Unified Action Day to Prevent Revision and Strive for the Abolition of the Security Treaty." On this day, various protest rallies will be held throughout the country, and street publicity activities will be carried out.

The plan stipulates that before the House of Councillors election to be held on June 2nd, open questionnaires will be submitted to various candidates, requiring them to state their attitude on the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the Tokyo District Court's ruling on the Sunagawa incident. According to the action plan, the National Conference will also request newly elected local councils to pass resolutions on preventing the revision and striving for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The action plan also stipulates that June 25th will be the "Third National Unified Action Day to Prevent Revision and Strive for the Abolition of the Security Treaty."

The meeting decided to hold a National Congress of the National Conference in early June to decide on the specific activity plan for the second half of the year.

The Secretariat of the National Conference reported at the meeting that twenty prefectures across Japan have established joint struggle organizations against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," including the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, and another ten prefectures are preparing to establish such joint struggle organizations.

The All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations held "Rallies Against the Revision of the Security Treaty and to Overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet" in major cities across the country today.

In Tokyo, about a thousand students held a central rally. A resolution against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" was passed at the meeting. After the meeting, the students held a demonstration in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the "Defense Agency" of the Kishi Nobusuke government. (Attached picture)
