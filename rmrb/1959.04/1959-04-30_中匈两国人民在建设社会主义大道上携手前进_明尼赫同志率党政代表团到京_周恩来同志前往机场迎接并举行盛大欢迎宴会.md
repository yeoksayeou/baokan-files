We hope that through this visit and the talks on issues of common concern to the people of China and Hungary, we will strengthen the existing ties between our two peoples and further consolidate the unity of the entire socialist camp.

Before Prime Minister Münnich's speech, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech first (full text on page two), expressing the warmest welcome to the distinguished guests on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people. In his speech, he warmly praised the great achievements made by the Hungarian people in the cause of defending peace and building socialism, and thanked the distinguished guests for their friendly visit.

At the end of their speeches, both Premiers enthusiastically shouted: Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Hungary! Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Peng Zhen, Member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Chen Yi, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, and He Long, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, were also present at the airport to welcome the distinguished guests.

Also present at the airport were Vice Premiers Nie Rongzhen and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, and Cheng Qian of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Xie Juezai, President of the Supreme People's Court, Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, and Burhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Wang Jiaxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and Yang Shangkun, Alternate Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, also went to welcome the delegation.

Also present at the airport to welcome the guests were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, responsible persons of various departments of state organs, democratic parties, and people's organizations, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

The distinguished guests were accompanied to Beijing today by Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hao Deqing, Chinese Ambassador to Hungary, Yu Peiwen, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others.

Groups of girls and Young Pioneers in festive attire ran out from the welcoming ranks from time to time to present flowers to Prime Minister Münnich and all the distinguished guests. Thousands of people waved bouquets and colorful silks, applauding and cheering to their hearts' content: "Long live Sino-Hungarian friendship!" "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "Long live world peace!"

Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, hosted a grand banquet tonight to warmly welcome the entire Hungarian Party and Government Delegation led by Ferenc Münnich, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government.

In the hall of the Beijing Hotel, which was filled with an atmosphere of boundless friendship and joy, more than 500 Chinese and foreign guests continuously raised their glasses to warmly congratulate the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Hungary, and to congratulate the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the international communist movement centered on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke first at the banquet, expressing a warm welcome and heartfelt respect to all the distinguished guests who had come from afar.

Premier Zhou said that the people of China and Hungary are both advancing victoriously along the glorious path of the October Revolution. Common ideals and common struggles have closely united us. The friendship between the people of China and Hungary, built on the basis of proletarian internationalism, will inevitably be strengthened day by day.

Premier Zhou said that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has now become a powerful fortress for world peace and the cause of human progress. In contrast to the flourishing situation of the socialist camp, the imperialist camp headed by the United States is heading towards its doom. Their policies of aggression and war have been repeatedly defeated. He pointed out that under the pressure of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the United States, Britain, and France have had to accept the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a foreign ministers' conference and a summit conference. We hope that these conferences will help to resolve the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the termination of the occupation regime in West Berlin, and other mature international issues, so as to eliminate the threat to European security and promote the relaxation of international tensions.

Premier Zhou emphasized that in order to safeguard our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Chinese people defeated the military provocations carried out by the United States against our country in the Taiwan Strait last year, and now we have crushed the armed rebellion launched by the reactionary group in Tibet in collusion with imperialists and foreign interventionists, and are continuing to fight against all external aggression and interference to achieve the complete unification of the motherland. In the cause of the Chinese people's socialist construction and opposition to aggression, the Hungarian people have consistently given the Chinese people strong support and assistance.

All the Chinese and foreign guests welcomed Prime Minister Münnich's speech with a long and enthusiastic applause. He said that proletarian internationalism is the firmest foundation for our future work and for achieving success. Precisely for this reason, in our meetings and talks we have placed special emphasis on the close cooperation between the countries of the socialist camp and the need to continue strengthening the ties between our two countries, and in particular the need for the unity of the international workers' revolutionary movement and the common struggle against revisionist distortions of Marxism-Leninism.

Prime Minister Münnich once again expressed the Hungarian people's unwavering support for the Chinese people's struggle to defend the unification of their motherland and safeguard peace. He declared: Our people, our party and government share your views on all international political issues, support your just stand, and I, on behalf of all the people of our country, wish you an early final victory in your heroic struggle.

Prime Minister Münnich finally emphasized that the common goals of striving for peace, socialism, and social progress unite us. He said that no matter what the imperialists say or hope for, the great People's Republic of China still exists and is developing rapidly. He warmly congratulated the Chinese people on continuing to achieve new successes on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958.

The national flags of China and Hungary were hung on the rostrum of the banquet hall, and the front of the stage was filled with flowers and evergreen palms. After the speeches by the two Prime Ministers, the band played the national anthems of Hungary and China respectively.

The Hungarian youth, cultural, women's, and trade union delegations, as well as all the members of the Hungarian State Opera House small ballet troupe who are visiting our country, and Hungarian experts and students in Beijing were invited to attend the banquet. Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass at the banquet to wish all the Hungarian guests good health.

    今天，北京天气晴朗，碧空万里，中、匈两国国旗在机场上迎风飘荡。“欢迎以明尼赫·费伦茨总理为首的匈牙利党政代表团”的巨幅标语，悬挂在机场的高大楼房上，十分夺目。十二时五十分，银色的专机在热烈的掌声和欢呼声中降落。七十多岁的明尼赫总理神采奕奕地走下飞机，微笑着向欢迎群众挥手致意。这时，周恩来总理等党和国家的领导人都迎到飞机前面，同贵宾们亲切地握手。
    周恩来总理陪同明尼赫总理检阅了仪仗队后，首都少年儿童向明尼赫总理和全体匈牙利贵宾们献花。
    明尼赫总理在机场上发表了充满兄弟友谊的热情讲话（全文见第二版）。他说，兄弟国家的代表的相互访问必将使社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结变得更加坚强。我们希望通过这次访问和就中匈两国人民共同关心的问题而进行的会谈，来加强我们两国人民之间已有的联系和进一步巩固整个社会主义阵营的团结。
    在明尼赫总理讲话以前，周恩来总理首先致词（全文见第二版），他代表中国共产党中央委员会、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，向贵宾们表示最热烈的欢迎。他在讲话中热情地赞扬了匈牙利人民在保卫和平和建设社会主义的事业中所取得的伟大成就，并且感谢贵宾们的友好访问。
    两国总理在结束讲话时，都热烈地高呼：中匈两国人民之间牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
    今天，中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记彭真，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理贺龙，都到机场欢迎贵宾。
    到机场欢迎的，还有副总理聂荣臻、习仲勋，副委员长李济深、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、程潜，最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，国防委员会副主席张治中，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉。
    中共中央书记处书记王稼祥、中共中央候补书记杨尚昆，也前往欢迎。
    到机场欢迎的，还有外交部副部长章汉夫和国家机关各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人，以及各国驻华使节。

    最后，周恩来总理等陪同明尼赫总理和全体贵宾绕机场一周，同欢迎群众见面。这时，机场上锣鼓喧天，暴风雨般的掌声一阵接着一阵。欢迎的行列中不时跑出一群群穿着节日盛装的姑娘和少先队员，向明尼赫总理和全体贵宾献花。几千群众挥舞着花束和各色采绢，尽情地向贵宾们鼓掌、欢呼：“中匈友好万岁！”“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”
    新华社29日讯　中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来今晚举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎以匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会政治局委员、工农革命政府总理明尼赫·费伦茨为首的匈牙利党政代表团全体贵宾。
    在洋溢着无限友好和欢乐气氛的北京饭店大厅里，出席宴会的五百多位中外来宾不断举杯，热烈祝贺中匈两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊，祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和以苏共为中心的国际共产主义运动的伟大团结。
    周恩来总理在宴会上首先讲话，对远道而来的全体贵宾表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。
    周总理说，中匈两国人民都沿着十月革命的光辉道路胜利前进。共同的理想和共同的斗争把我们紧密地团结在一起。建筑在无产阶级国际主义基础上的中匈两国人民的友谊必将日益加强。
    周总理说，目前以苏联为首的社会主义阵营已经成为世界和平和人类进步事业的强大堡垒。同社会主义阵营蒸蒸日上的情况相反，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营正走向日暮途穷。它们的侵略政策和战争政策已经节节失败。他指出，在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的压力下，美、英、法三国已经不得不接受苏联关于召开外长会议和政府首脑会议的建议。我们希望，这些会议能够有助于解决缔结对德和约、结束西柏林占领制度和其他一些成熟了的国际问题，以消除对欧洲安全的威胁，促使国际紧张局势的和缓。
    周总理着重说，为了维护我国的主权和领土完整，中国人民在去年曾经击败了美国在台湾海峡对我国进行的军事挑衅，现在又粉碎了西藏反动集团勾结帝国主义和外国干涉者所发动的武装叛乱，并且正继续为反对一切外来的侵略和干涉、实现祖国的完全统一而斗争。在中国人民建设社会主义和反对侵略的事业中，匈牙利人民一贯给予了中国人民以有力的支持和援助。
    全体中外来宾以长时间的热烈掌声欢迎明尼赫总理讲话。他说，无产阶级国际主义是我们今后工作的和能够取得成就的最牢固的基础。正因为这样，在我们的会见和会谈中特别强调社会主义阵营各国之间的亲密合作和继续加强我们两国之间的联系的必要性，特别强调国际工人革命运动的团结和反对对马克思列宁主义的修正主义的歪曲的共同斗争的必要性。
    明尼赫总理再一次表示了匈牙利人民坚持支持中国人民捍卫祖国统一和保卫和平的斗争。他宣称：我国人民、我们的党和政府在一切国际政治问题上和你们的意见是一致的，支持你们的正义立场，并且我以我国全体人民的名义，祝你们的英勇斗争早日取得最后胜利。
    明尼赫总理最后强调指出，争取和平、社会主义和社会进步的共同目标把我们联结在一起。他说，不管帝国主义者说些什么，或者指望些什么，伟大的中华人民共和国仍然存在着，并且迅速地发展着。他热烈祝贺中国人民在1958年大跃进的基础上继续获得新的成就。
    宴会大厅的主席台上悬挂着中匈两国国旗，台前布满鲜花和常青棕榈。两国总理讲话结束后，乐队分别高奏匈中两国国歌。
    正在我国访问的匈牙利青年、文化、妇女、工会等四个代表团和匈牙利国家歌剧院小型芭蕾舞团的全体人员，在北京的匈牙利专家和留学生，应邀出席了宴会。周恩来总理在宴会上举杯，祝贺全体匈牙利来宾身体健康。
