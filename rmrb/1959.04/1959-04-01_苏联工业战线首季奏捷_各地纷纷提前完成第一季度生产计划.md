In recent days, good news has been constantly pouring in from all over the Soviet Union about the early completion of the first quarter industrial production plans for the first year of the Seven-Year Plan by various Union Republics, Economic Regions, and enterprises. Compared with the same period last year, their industrial output has further increased.

Among the Soviet Union's Union Republics, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Estonia, and Lithuania were the first to report the good news of completing their first quarter industrial production plans ahead of schedule. The deadline for completing the quarterly plan was brought forward by two to four days. The Republic of Lithuania even finished a week early. By the time they completed the first quarter ahead of schedule, the total industrial output value of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Estonia had increased by 11% to 12% compared with the same period last year, while Lithuania had increased by 20%.

In addition, many industrial enterprises in Stalingrad, Saratov, and other places have now begun to work on the second quarter. The employees of the "Red October" steel factory in Stalingrad have been carefully studying the documents of the 12th All-Union Trade Union Congress these days.

    苏联工业战线首季奏捷
    各地纷纷提前完成第一季度生产计划
    新华社莫斯科30日电　最近几天，苏联各地不断传来各加盟共和国、经济区和企业提前完成七年计划头一年的第一季度工业生产计划的喜讯。和去年同时期比较，它们的工业产量进一步增加了。
    在苏联各加盟共和国中，乌克兰、哈萨克、爱沙尼亚和立陶宛共和国最先传出提前完成第一季度工业生产计划的捷报。完成季度计划的期限都提前了两天到四天。立陶宛共和国甚至提前了一个星期。到提前完成第一季度的那个时候为止，乌克兰、哈萨克和爱沙尼亚共和国的工业总产值比去年同期增加了11％到12％，立陶宛共和国则增加了20％。
    在苏联最大的加盟共和国——俄罗斯联邦，马加丹、莫斯科州和图拉经济区国民经济委员会所属的工业企业，先后在27日和28日提前完成了今年第一季度的生产计划。马加丹经济区的工业总产值比去年第一季度增加了9％。莫斯科州国民经济委员会所属企业除了完成生产计划外，还提前完成了第一季度的提高劳动生产率的计划，并且掌握了一百多种新型机器的生产。此外，斯大林格勒、萨拉托夫等地的许多工业企业现在也已经开始作第二季度的工作。斯大林格勒的“红十月”钢铁工厂的职工这几天仔细学习了全苏工会第十二次代表大会的文件，工人劳动热情奋发，每天都超计划完成生产定额。
    从白俄罗斯和格鲁吉亚等共和国也传来了提前完成第一季度工业生产计划的消息。和苏联各地一样，这些共和国的工业企业在提前完成生产计划的同时，还展开了争取超计划完成节约计划的竞赛运动。
