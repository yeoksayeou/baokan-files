Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 15th - A fervent donation campaign has unfolded among the people of the Cuban capital to support land reform and the development of agricultural production in rural areas. Cuba is undertaking an economic construction plan aimed at reforming the old socio-economic system and shaking off the shackles of imperialist monopoly capital. This plan was called for by Prime Minister Castro and his government to the Cuban people, and it has been met with enthusiastic response nationwide.

Workers, employees, women, students, and business people in Havana are launching a donation campaign. They have purchased over a thousand tractors and other agricultural implements as gifts from the urban people to the farmers. In the courtyard of the old City Council building, in the picturesque Central Park, and in the National Stadium, which served as the historic court for the mass trials of counter-revolutionary criminals, as well as on all the main streets of the capital, brand-new and gleaming tractors are on display. Alongside these tractors are eye-catching banners with the slogan: "Work together for land reform. Today the city serves the countryside, tomorrow the countryside serves the whole country."

For the first time in Cuban history, urban residents are donating their money to help their farmer brothers. The workers of the Havana Electric Company have donated over $300,000. Sugar workers in Camagüey have donated a day's wages. Sailors, dockworkers, shop assistants, and housewives are also actively participating in the donation campaign. Even children are donating their pennies to support land reform. As a result of this donation campaign, the policies regarding land reform and the development of agriculture and the national economy have taken deep root in the minds of the broad masses.

In the countryside, farmers are holding grand rallies to support the land reform and agricultural production development plan. Prime Minister Castro recently stated at the First Revolutionary Farmers Congress held in Camagüey Province that the government has allocated 115 million pesos from the land reform fund as the first investment in land reform. For example, the government has provided a loan of one million dollars to a cooperative of 800 households in Camagüey Province. The Prime Minister also said that Cuba will establish a national land reform association to help realize land reform. In his speech, Castro emphasized that the Cuban people must use their own blood and sweat and their own tenacious spirit to make their motherland strong.

　　古巴首都展开捐献运动
　　支持土改和农业生产
    新华社哈瓦那15日电　古巴首都的人民展开了一个热火朝天的捐献运动，来支持农村的土地改革和发展农业生产。古巴正在进行一项旨在改革旧的社会经济和摆脱帝国主义垄断资本束缚的经济建设计划，这个计划是卡斯特罗总理及其政府向古巴人民发出的号召，全国人民热烈响应这个号召。
    哈瓦那的工人、雇员、妇女、学生和工商界人士正展开一个捐献运动。他们购买了一千多架拖拉机和其他农具，作为城市人民的礼物送给农民。在市议会古老大厦的庭院中，在风景如画的中央公园以及作为群众公审反革命罪犯的历史性法庭的国家体育场和首都所有的大街上都摆满了崭新而光亮的拖拉机。在这些拖拉机旁边可以看到醒目的大幅标语：“协力进行土地改革。今天城市为农村服务，明天农村为全国服务。”
    城市居民在古巴历史上破天荒第一次捐出自己的钱来帮助他们的农民兄弟。哈瓦那电力公司的工人捐出了三十多万美元。卡马圭的制糖工人捐出了他们一天的工资。海员、码头工人、店员和家庭主妇也积极地参加了这次捐献运动。连孩子们也捐出了他们的几分钱来支援土地改革。由于这次捐献运动，关于土地改革以及发展农业和国民经济的政策在广大群众的思想中深深地生了根。
    在农村中，农民举行盛大集会来支持土地改革和发展农业生产的计划。卡斯特罗总理最近在卡马圭省举行的第一届革命农民代表大会上说，政府已经从土地改革基金中拨出了一亿一千五百万比索作为对土地改革的第一批投资。例如，政府向卡马圭省的一个八百户的合作社就提供了一百万美元的贷款。总理还说，古巴将建立全国土地改革协会来帮助实现土地改革。卡斯特罗在讲话中强调指出，古巴人民必须以自己的血汗和自己的顽强精神来使祖国强大起来。
