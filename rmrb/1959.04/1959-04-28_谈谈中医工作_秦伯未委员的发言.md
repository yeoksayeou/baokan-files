Talk About Traditional Chinese Medicine Work
Speech by Committee Member Qin Bowen

Mr. Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of all the leading comrades. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, New China's achievements are glorious, and our people's democratic united front has become more consolidated and expanded. In the nationwide leaps forward in industry, agriculture, and other fields, the enthusiasm and drive of the Chinese people for socialist construction are unparalleled.

Rapid Progress in Treatment, Teaching, and Research of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shaanxi

I am a practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Please allow me to discuss the work of TCM. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party, it has also made unprecedented leaps forward and achieved certain successes. Premier Zhou's instructions regarding health work in his report are: "We should unite practitioners of both Chinese and Western medicine, organize them to serve the people's health cause together, and jointly promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and develop medical science." From what I have recently seen of the development of health services in Shaanxi Province, especially in the field of TCM, it is sufficient to demonstrate that this instruction is completely correct. Last October, when I went to Xi'an, more than 16,000 TCM practitioners in Shaanxi Province had been properly arranged for; more than 3,500 TCM apprentices had been taken on, some of whom were already able to engage in treatment work; extensive efforts were made to seek out wise practitioners and obtain prescriptions, collecting more than 300,000 secret and effective prescriptions; seven TCM hospitals were established throughout the province, and most hospitals and health centers added TCM departments, TCM wards, and Chinese herbal medicine rooms; a TCM school was also established, along with three TCM refresher courses, and training classes for TCM teachers and acupuncture, etc. More than 1,700 TCM practitioners have undergone further training, and 800 to 900 TCM practitioners have participated in correspondence courses. The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences' Shaanxi branch also established a TCM Research Institute and an Acupuncture Research Institute. This was the situation last winter. It can be seen that TCM work in Shaanxi Province has been fully developed in treatment, teaching, and research, presenting a thriving scene. This March, I went to Xi'an again. Only four months had passed, and in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, a new situation had emerged. The last time I went, the TCM Research Institute only had an outpatient department; this time, beds had been added. The Municipal TCM Hospital expanded from 200 beds to 500 beds, an increase of more than one and a half times. What stood out was that when I left Xi'an last winter, the popularization of acupuncture had not yet begun. This time, a mass acupuncture learning movement had been launched throughout the province, and organizations such as acupuncture teacher training classes, short-term training classes, and lectures were established, acupuncture textbooks were compiled, lectures were conducted separately, and the Health Department mobilized some acupuncture personnel to form twelve working groups to serve as acupuncture teachers in 47 counties including Yulin, Yan'an, Hanzhong, Shangluo, Ankang, Baoji, and Weinan. At present, medical personnel at the provincial and all levels have basically mastered the preliminary techniques of acupuncture application. In Chang'an and Wugong, acupuncture has been implemented among young and middle-aged commune members in the entire county or township and society. In counties such as Yan'an and Yichuan, not only has acupuncture been basically realized for the entire population, but in order to meet the need for needles after the popularization of acupuncture, a steel needle factory has also been established. In the acupuncture learning movement, health administrative cadres at all levels and responsible comrades of Party and government organizations also participated in the study, generally familiar with the twelve meridians and fifty to one hundred acupoints. There is truly a feeling of "刮目相看" [idiom: treat somebody with increased respect after an interval].

The Shaanxi Provincial Health Department conscientiously implemented the Party's TCM policy, and also grasped the key to sorting out and carrying forward the legacy of Chinese medicine by having Western medicine practitioners learn from TCM. In addition to the existing half-year system of rotating training courses for intermediate-level Western medicine practitioners to learn TCM, a two-year full-time TCM learning class for senior Western medicine practitioners has recently been established within four months; the Fourth Military Medical University has also added TCM courses, and decided to make a concentrated effort to learn TCM in the next six months, and organized a TCM teaching and research group, with the leader of the Health Department personally taking charge as the director of the teaching and research group. With the leap forward in TCM work, the unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine practitioners has become closer, and the combination of TCM and Western medicine in the treatment of many diseases has achieved significant results. For example, the cure rate for type B encephalitis reached 95.6%, the cure rate for acute and chronic appendicitis reached 94%, and the effects of infectious hepatitis, mumps, etc. all reached more than 90%. The Provincial Institute of Endemic Diseases used acupuncture and internal use of Chinese medicine to treat Kashin-Beck disease, basically alleviating the suffering of existing Kashin-Beck disease patients in Guantou Township, Qian County.

The above is an overview of TCM work in Shaanxi Province. We know that TCM work in other provinces and cities is also developing vigorously and has made even greater achievements. Anyone who has visited the National Experience Exchange Conference on Pharmaceutical and Health Technology Revolution last year was excited by the brilliance of traditional Chinese medicine. The reason why TCM work nationwide has achieved the above results is that the Party has put forward the great policy of uniting TCM and Western medicine practitioners and the TCM policy, and pharmaceutical and health personnel have solved the most basic ideological problems and clarified the direction of future efforts. With everyone's direction clarified, the energy is great, which has given full play to the enthusiasm of the vast number of medical workers, and made the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine leap forward and shine. Of course, our work is still not enough, and it is far from meeting the Party's requirements. Every health administrative staff member and every medical worker must continue to study this policy in depth, conscientiously implement it, thereby improving their thinking, unifying their understanding, and promoting TCM and Chinese herbal medicine to take on a brilliant future of "blooming everywhere" along with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

Four Suggestions for Consultation and Encouragement Among Fellow TCM Practitioners

Sorting out and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine is an arduous task, and fellow TCM practitioners must take on greater responsibilities to complete this glorious task of historical significance. I would like to put forward the following suggestions for consultation and encouragement among fellow practitioners:

1.  Since the completion of the rectification campaign, the anti-rightist struggle, and the criticism of bourgeois individualism, the ideological understanding of fellow TCM practitioners has generally improved. They sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, consciously carry out self-transformation, and actively explore potential strength in their work, which is worthy of attention. However, it is wrong to think that one is flawless or that one is already both red and expert. Bourgeois intellectuals still have the common problems of arrogance, detachment from the masses, and detachment from reality. They must thoroughly transform their thinking in order to keep up with the times. Premier Zhou told us: "All old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually achieve self-transformation in future long-term work practice." He also pointed out: "Old intellectuals who politically stand on the side of socialism and are with the broad masses of people can use the knowledge and technology they have mastered in the socialist cause, give full play to their expertise, and be welcomed by the people." We must always keep this in mind, strengthen political and theoretical study, approach the masses, participate in labor, and strive to move forward.

2.  In the current work of TCM, whether it is training new TCM forces or Western medicine practitioners learning TCM, it depends on TCM practitioners to impart knowledge, experience, and learning methods to them. In this way, the professional level of TCM practitioners themselves must also be improved at the same time. Not only those who are already teachers should continue to study, but also those who are engaged in treatment should have more abundant knowledge, especially those who are currently training TCM teachers. They should think of the heavy teaching tasks in the future and work harder. The leadership can also consider whether the teacher training of one year in general can meet the requirements. In addition to the current urgent needs, whether it is possible to select a few outstanding members from this class for further training, or to train them by subject, so that they can get more specialized and skilled opportunities. While improving TCM skills, those with certain conditions can learn some basic knowledge of modern medicine. Mutual learning and exchange of experience between TCM and Western medicine practitioners is beneficial to cooperation.

3.  TCM has a complete theoretical system, and all kinds of treatment methods such as drugs, acupuncture, massage, and qigong belong to one theory. The creations and inventions of medical scientists of past dynasties, as well as the diseases that modern medicine still lacks methods for, can be treated effectively by TCM based on this theory as a guide. In the past, individual Western medicine practitioners believed that the theory of TCM was far from modern medicine and did not recognize that TCM has a theory at all. This incorrect view once affected individual TCM practitioners and always shrouded a shadow in their minds. Some advocate that TCM practitioners only need to see patients and do not need to talk about theory, and that only Western medicine practitioners should talk about theory; some do not explain the efficacy from the theoretical basis of TCM, but specialize in studying that a certain drug can cure a certain disease, and that acupuncture at a certain acupoint can cure a certain disease. I believe that studying TCM without mastering TCM theory is obviously contrary to the dialectical materialist viewpoint, and its result is no different from buying a casket and returning the pearl. Premier Zhou said: "The research of basic theory has a far-reaching impact on the development of science and technology, and must be given sufficient attention." Fellow TCM practitioners should pay special attention to this point in their work and combine theory and practice at any time.

4.  In the current work of TCM, it is inevitable that there will be some difficulties. For example, the TCM team has hundreds of thousands of people, and the number cannot be considered small. Due to the rapid development of TCM work, the distribution is still not enough, and it is not easy to find appropriate adjustments; in terms of equipment, due to material resources, it cannot meet the requirements of all parties; especially the serious shortage of Chinese herbal medicine, the supply is less than the demand, which has brought great difficulties to treatment. However, these difficulties are temporary. Everyone knows that all regions are vigorously training TCM talents and cultivating a large number of Chinese herbal medicines. The health department has already been doing it, and it can be completely resolved after a period of time. The question is how to overcome this temporary difficulty. I think that units with weak manpower can find ways to link up with fraternal units and ask for their assistance when necessary; the same applies to units with insufficient equipment can contact units with conditions. Regarding the use of Chinese herbal medicine, we should adopt the principle of using when necessary and saving when possible, and try to avoid waste as much as possible, and use pills or powders as much as possible within the possible range to reduce the consumption of decoctions. We must recognize that diligence and thrift, hard work, and perseverance are our long-term policy for socialist construction. As long as we learn from the workers and peasants the spirit of doing practical work, hard work, and clever work, any difficulty can be overcome.

In 1959, China's construction in all aspects will have a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, and it will be the 10th anniversary of the founding of our great motherland. On this great day, we are happy and comfortable, and the task is arduous and glorious. We must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, go all out, aim high, and strive to serve production and construction.

I wish all the committee members good health!

    谈谈中医工作
    秦伯未委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和各位首长的报告。在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，新中国的成就是辉煌的，我国的人民民主统一战线更加巩固和扩大了，在全国工农业和其它方面的飞跃发展中，也显示了全国人民为社会主义建设的热情和干劲是无可比拟的。
    陕西中医治疗、教学和研究工作突飞猛进
    我是一个中医工作者，请就中医工作来谈谈。几年来在党的正确领导下，同样空前的突飞猛进，并且取得了一定的成绩。周总理报告中关于卫生工作的指示是：“应当团结中西医，组织他们共同为人民卫生事业服务，共同发扬祖国医学遗产和发展医学科学。”从我最近看到陕西省的卫生事业特别是中医方面的发展，足够说明这个指示是完全正确的。去年十月我去西安市，陕西省一万六千多中医都已进行了妥善的安排；带起了三千五百多中医徒弟，其中一部分已能从事治疗工作；广泛的访贤求方，采集了秘方、验方三十多万件；在全省设立了七个中医医院，医院、卫生院大多增设了中医科、中医病房和中药室；还成立了中医学校一所，中医进修班三处，举办了中医师资、针灸等训练班，经过进修培养的中医有一千七百多人，函授进修的中医亦有八、九百人；中国医学科学院陕西分院也设立了中医研究所和针灸研究所。这是去年冬季的情况，可以看到陕西省的中医工作，在治疗方面、教学方面和研究方面已经全面发展，呈现了欣欣向荣的气象。今年三月我再去西安，相隔仅仅四个月时间，在大跃进的高潮里又出现了新的局面。上次去的时候，中医研究所只有门诊部，这次已添设了病床；市中医院从二百床位扩充到五百张床位，比原来增加一倍半；中医学校已改为中医学院，初中毕业生和高中毕业生同时招收。突出的是当我去冬离开西安时，普及针灸工作尚未开展，这一次去，全省各地相继掀起了针灸学习运动，成立了针灸师资班、短期训练班和讲习班等组织，编写针灸讲义，分别进行教授，并由卫生厅调动一部分针灸人员组成十二个工作组，分赴榆林、延安、汉中、商雒、安康、宝鸡、渭南等四十七个县担任普及针灸教师。目前省和各级医务人员已基本掌握了针灸应用的初步技术，长安、武功已实现全县或乡、社青壮年社员针灸化，延安、宜川等县不但基本实现了全民针灸化，为了满足在针灸普及后的用针需要，还成立钢针制造厂。在针灸学习运动中，各地的卫生行政干部和各级党政的负责同志也参加了学习，一般熟悉十二经络及五十至一百个穴位，真有“士别三日，刮目相看”的感觉。
    陕西省卫生部门认真贯彻党的中医政策，还抓住整理和发扬祖国医学在于西医学习中医这一关键，除已办半年制的中级西医学习中医轮训班外，最近四个月内又举办了两年毕业的高级西医脱产学习中医班；第四军医大学也加添了中医课，决定在这半年内突击学习中医，组织中医教研组，卫生厅领导上亲自挂帅担任了教研组主任。随着中医工作的跃进，中西医的团结合作愈加紧密，中西结合应用中药治疗许多疾病取得了显著的效果。例如：乙型脑炎治愈率达百分之九十五点六，急慢性阑尾炎治愈率达百分之九十四，传染性肝炎、腮腺炎等效果均达百分之九十以上，该省地方病研究所用针灸和内服中药治疗大骨节病，基本上解除了乾县关头乡现有的大骨节病人的痛苦。
    上面是陕西一省的中医工作概况，我们知道其它各省、市的中医工作都在蓬勃地发展，还作出了更多的成绩。凡是参观过去年全国医药卫生技术革命经验交流大会的人们，均替祖国医学放出异彩而感到兴奋。全国中医工作所以能取得以上成绩，是由于党提出了伟大的团结中西医方针和中医政策，医药卫生人员解决了最基本的思想问题，和明确了今后努力的方向。大家方向明确，劲头就大，发挥了广大医务工作者的积极性，使祖国医学飞跃地发扬光大。当然，我们的工作还是不够的，对于党的要求相差尚远。每一个卫生行政人员和每一个医药工作者，必须对这方针政策继续深入学习，认真贯彻，从而提高思想，统一认识，促使中医中药随着工农业生产大跃进，采取“遍地花开分外妍”的灿烂前途。
    提出四点意见，愿与中医同道商榷和共勉
    整理和发扬祖国医学是一项艰巨的任务，中医同道们必须负起更大的责任来完成这具有历史意义的光荣任务。我愿意提出如下几点意见，与同道们商榷和共勉之：
    一、自从通过整风、反右、批判资产阶级个人主义之后，中医同道们的思想认识普遍提高，真诚地接受党的领导，自觉地进行自我改造，并积极地在工作中发掘潜在力量，这是值得重视的。然而就此自以为白璧无瑕，或者以为已经又红又专，那是不对的。资产阶级知识分子还存在自高自大，脱离群众，脱离实际的通病，必须彻底改造思想，才能跟着时代前进。周总理告诉我们：“一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造。”又指出：“旧知识分子在政治上站到社会主义这一方面来，同广大人民在一起，就能够在社会主义事业中运用他们所掌握的知识和技术，发挥他们的专长，受到人民的欢迎。”我们必须时时刻刻牢记心头，加强政治和理论学习，接近群众，参加劳动，力争上游。
    二、在目前的中医工作中，不论培养中医新生力量和西医学习中医，都靠中医把知识和经验及学习方法等传授给他们。这样，对中医本身业务水平也必须同时提高。不仅已当老师的要不断钻研，就是搞治疗的也要有更丰富的学问，特别是正在训练的中医师资们，应当想到未来的繁重教学任务而加倍努力。领导上也可考虑一般以一年为期的师资训练是否能满足要求，除了目前的急需外，是否可以在这班内抽选少数优秀分子加以再训练，或者分科训练，使他们得到更专更高明的机会。在提高中医业务的同时，具有一定条件的可以学习一些现代医学基础知识。中西医互相学习、交流经验，对合作上有好处。
    三、中医有一套完整的理论体系，所有药物、针灸、推拿、气功等多种多样的治疗方法同属一个理论。历代医学家的创造和发明，以及近来对于现代医学尚还缺少办法的疾病，经中医治疗能够收到良好效果，都靠这理论作为思想指导。过去个别西医认为中医的理论与现代医学有距离，根本不承认中医有理论，这种不正确的观点曾经影响到个别的中医，在思想上也始终笼罩着一片阴影。有的主张中医只要看病，不必谈理论，理论只有让西医去谈；有的不从中医理论基础上说明疗效，专从某药能治某病，针灸某穴能治某种病症来研究。我以为不掌握中医理论去研究中医，显然是违反辩证唯物观点的，它的结果无异于买椟还珠。周总理说：“基础理论的研究，对于科学技术的发展具有深远的影响，必须给以足够的重视。”中医同道们在工作中应当特别注意这一点，随时把理论和实践结合起来。
    四、当前中医工作中，难免存在一些困难。比如中医队伍有数十万人，数字不能算小，由于中医工作的迅速发展，分配还是不够，求得适当调剂也不容易；设备方面限于物力，不能满足各方面的要求；尤其严重的中药缺乏，供不应求，在治疗上带来了极大困难。但是，这些困难都是暂时的，大家知道各地正在大力培养中医人才和栽培大量中药，卫生部门早已在做了，过了一个时期是完全可以解决的。问题在于如何来渡过这个暂时的难关。我认为人力薄弱的单位，可想法和兄弟单位挂钩，必要时请其协助；设备不够的同样可和有条件的单位取得联系。关于中药的使用，采取当用则用，能省则省的原则，极力避免浪费，在可能范围内多用丸剂或粉剂来减少煎剂的消耗量。必须认识克勤克俭，刻苦耐劳，是我们社会主义建设的长期方针，只要向工农们学习实干、苦干、巧干的精神，任何困难都能战胜的。
    一九五九年我国各方面的建设将有更大更好更全面的跃进，并且是我们伟大的祖国建立十周年。在这个伟大的日子里，我们心情是愉快而舒畅，而任务则是艰巨而光荣。我们必须在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，面向生产建设服务而奋斗。
    祝贺各位委员身体健康！
