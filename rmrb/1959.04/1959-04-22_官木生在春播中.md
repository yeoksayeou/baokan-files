Guan Musheng is in the Midst of Spring Planting
By our reporter Gu Weijin
Mobilizing the Masses with Facts

During the Spring Festival, while people were busy with New Year greetings and watching operas, Guan Musheng, an agricultural labor model, deputy director of the Pengxing People's Commune in Xiaogan County, Hubei, and secretary of the Changfeng Production Team branch, was already considering this year's production. His production team is rich in rice, and early rice accounts for the largest proportion of its yield. He had previously discussed with some cadres and commune members: Since early rice achieved a large-scale bumper harvest last year and there are many favorable conditions for increasing early rice production this year (such as sufficient fertilizer, more winter fallow fields that can be prepared in advance, etc.), they should aim to "earn the whole year in one season" with early rice this year. That is to say, early rice plus spring-harvested crops can equal last year's total output. The primary key to achieving this goal is to seize the season and plant in a timely manner. However, the traditional habit here has always been "sowing half the seeds during Qingming and half the seedlings during Guyu." According to past experience, this cannot effectively seize the season. This year, this habit should be changed, and sowing should be advanced... Considering these issues, Guan Musheng went to the technical team leader, Guan Bentang, to discuss advancing the sowing.

"How about sowing now?" Guan Musheng said excitedly.

"How can you sow during the Spring Festival? It can't be done, it can't be done," Guan Bentang repeatedly shook his head.

"This is indeed a problem, but I'm thinking of doing an experiment—planting a small experimental plot. If it succeeds, wouldn't it encourage everyone to advance sowing?"

After the two discussed it, Guan Bentang happily agreed. They jointly studied a series of measures such as seed drying, sowing, and soil-heated germination, and also set up moist seedling fields. In mid-February, the seeds sprouted, and Guan Musheng began sowing.

It was a sunny day with plenty of sunshine, but people still felt cold. He patiently sowed the seeds evenly, and then covered them with a layer of old wall soil and wood ash to keep the seeds warm. In the middle of the night, he often got up to observe the changes in the weather. When the cold wave arrived, he erected short frames on the seedling fields and covered them with straw mats. The seedlings were well cared for and grew very quickly. In early March, they began to turn green.

This matter quickly spread from the production team to the entire commune. At this time, people had not yet set up seedling fields to soak the seeds, and some did not believe that Guan Musheng's seedlings had turned green. However, when they came to Guan Musheng's experimental field and saw the seedlings lush and green, with their roots firmly planted, they all praised Guan Musheng's communist style of daring to think and act. Guan Musheng, for his part, patiently introduced the experience of setting up seedling fields and caring for seedlings to the visitors. People went back and immediately set up seedling fields and soaked the seeds... By the end of March, the sowing work from the Changfeng Production Team to the entire commune was basically completed. Guan Musheng calculated that this year's early rice sowing was at least ten days to half a month earlier than last year.

Relying on the Masses to Find Solutions

Even before sowing began, Guan Musheng paid attention to the problem of seedling fertilizer. Of the team's two hundred acres of seedling fields, only 30% had fertilizer. The remaining fields, in addition to relying on green manure and specialized teams to accumulate fertilizer outside, also needed to mobilize the broad masses to accumulate fertilizer. However, when it came to mobilizing the masses to accumulate fertilizer, some cadres felt it was difficult, saying that fertilizer had been accumulated every year, and the sources of fertilizer had been exhausted. Guan Musheng believed that as long as he went deep into the situation and relied on the masses, the fertilizer problem could be solved. He set out to tackle this task.

Guan Musheng went to the Second Team and saw that the soil next to the threshing ground was dark black. He asked the commune members and learned that when beans were threshed in the past, many leaves fell into the soil, and domestic poultry and livestock often defecated here. Guan Musheng thought to himself that every team had such a threshing ground, which was another source of fertilizer. He and the commune members dug up the soil next to the threshing ground of this team, and accumulated a lot of fertilizer in one day... In a few days, Guan Musheng, relying on the assistance of the masses, discovered dozens of sources of fertilizer.

Guan Musheng convened an on-site meeting of all team cadres and activists to introduce the experience of accumulating fertilizer. People were very moved after listening to his introduction and seeing his achievements in accumulating fertilizer. They said with confidence: "As long as we learn from Guan Musheng, take action ourselves, and rely on the masses, the sources of fertilizer will never be exhausted."

Under the impetus of the on-site meeting, the fertilizer accumulation work was launched. Guan Musheng participated in the fertilizer accumulation work of the team every day. He was both a fighter and a commander. This day, he was accumulating fertilizer in the First Team when he suddenly noticed that some commune members lacked enthusiasm. He also found the same situation in other teams. He also saw some commune members casually pouring away the very fertile sewage from their homes, whereas in the past these things were poured into manure pits. Guan Musheng was very surprised. After talking with some commune members, he learned that the quotas were not reasonable enough, and small amounts of fertilizer from households were not properly rewarded. Guan Musheng discussed with the branch to set reasonable quotas based on the strength of the labor force, and at the same time stipulated a method of paying cash and in-kind rewards for household fertilizer accumulation. At the same time, he also carried out political mobilization on the significance of fertilizer accumulation to the commune members. The commune members were very happy. A large-scale fertilizer accumulation competition was launched throughout the team.

During the competition, commune members looked for fertilizer sources everywhere. This day, some cadres suggested to Guan Musheng: Demolish the old and dilapidated houses of the commune members, take out the old soil as fertilizer, and build new houses for the commune members instead. Guan Musheng said: What do the commune members think? The cadres said that the commune members would not be unwilling to demolish old houses and build new houses. Guan Musheng said that this matter still needs to be discussed with the commune members. He convened a meeting of commune member representatives to discuss this issue. The representatives pointed out: Demolishing old houses and building new houses is a good thing in itself, but now is the busy farming season. It is impossible to build new houses immediately after demolishing old houses, and the commune members have to live together, which is not very convenient. This remark caught Guan Musheng's attention. He pondered for a while and said: "Demolishing houses is indeed a problem. Let's do this: Everyone contributes an idea to solve the fertilizer source problem." The representatives happily discussed it. In the end, they put forward an opinion: Some old houses' "Jian Yuan" (the wall between two houses) have cracks or even tilted, and can be demolished as fertilizer, and replaced with new Yuan. Everyone thought this idea was very good: First, it does not take much effort to remove and replace the "Jian Yuan"; second, it protects the safety of the house; third, demolishing the "Jian Yuan" gets more fertilizer than demolishing the whole house. So everyone agreed to demolish the "Jian Yuan."

The fertilizer accumulation movement is developing normally. In a short time, more than 100,000 dan of fertilizer were accumulated, and the fertilizer problem for the seedling fields was basically solved. "What do the masses think?"

The sun began to warm the earth, and the fields were filled with the breath of spring. The transplanting season is coming. The production team's transplanting preparations are progressing smoothly. The paddy fields are almost cultivated, reaching "flat fields and rotten mud," according to the old farmers. The twenty-five transplanting experts selected by the team are training a group of commune members with poorer transplanting skills. Now, Guan Musheng feels that the problem that needs to be solved is close planting. The team's leading cadres have two opinions on close planting: one is to plant 100,000 seedlings per mu, and the other is that it is too dense. How can reasonable close planting be achieved? "Let's listen to the opinions of the team cadres who directly lead production." With this in mind, Guan Musheng found the team cadres to talk. They told him that planting 100,000 seedlings per mu is too dense. Some teams did this last year, which made the labor force very tight, and even delayed the early rice transplanting season, and because of excessive close planting, the fertilizer could not be supplied; however, some teams truthfully planted 40,000 to 50,000 seedlings per mu based on their team's labor force, fertilizer, and other conditions, and the work went very smoothly. From this matter, they came to a conclusion: Reasonable close planting is necessary to produce more grain, but how dense is reasonable depends on the objective conditions—whether the labor force, fertilizer, and season can keep up. After talking with the team cadres, Guan Musheng was greatly inspired. At the team's leading cadre meeting, Guan Musheng asked those who advocated planting 100,000 seedlings to first calculate the labor, fertilizer, and seasonal costs. Everyone started calculating. The team has 1,050 mu of early rice, and about 300 laborers are specially involved in transplanting. If 100,000 seedlings are planted per mu, 30 to 40 mu of fields can be transplanted in one day, and all the early rice can be transplanted in about a month. However, the early rice transplanting season is only half a month. As for fertilizer, 200 to 300 dan per mu are still lacking. After such a calculation, everyone felt that planting 100,000 seedlings was impossible. If 60,000 to 70,000 seedlings are planted per mu, the seedlings can be transplanted in half a month with the existing labor force, just in time for the season. So they tentatively decided to plant 60,000 to 70,000 seedlings per mu. The team cadres all felt that such close planting was more realistic. However, what do the broad masses think? Guan Musheng is mobilizing everyone to start a discussion.

    官木生在春播中
    本报记者　古维进
    用事实动员群众
    春节期间，人们正忙着拜年、看戏，农业劳动模范、湖北孝感县朋兴人民公社副主任、长风生产队支部书记官木生，却在考虑今年的生产问题了。他这个生产队盛产水稻，又以早稻在产量中占的比重最大。他曾经和一些干部、社员初步研究：由于去年早稻获得大面积丰产和今年早稻增产具有许多有利条件（如肥料足，冬闲田多，可以事先整好等），要求今年早稻做到“一季捞全年”。就是说早稻加上春收作物，就可以抵得上去年的全年产量。实现这个指标的首要一环就是抓住季节、适时播种。可是这里一向的习惯是“清明下半籽，谷雨下半秧”。根据过去的经验，这样是不能很好抓住季节的。今年应该改变这个习惯，提早播种……。考虑到这些问题，官木生去找技术队长官本堂研究提早播种的问题了。　　“现在播种怎么样？”官木生兴冲冲地说。　　“哪有在春节期间播种的？搞不得，搞不得。”官本堂连连摇头。　　“这的确是一个问题，不过，我是想来一个试验——种一块小小的试验田，要是搞成功了，不是可以带动大家都提早播种吗？”
    两个人商量了以后，官本堂欣然同意了。他们一同研究了晒种、播种、土温室催芽等一系列措施，同时办起了湿润秧田。2月中旬，种籽出了芽，官木生开始播种了。
    这是一个阳光普照的晴朗的天气，可是人还是感到冷。他耐心地把种籽撒得匀匀的，然后，盖上一层陈壁土和草木灰给种籽保暖。半夜里，他时常起来观察天气的变化。寒潮到来，他在秧田上搭起矮矮的架子，用草席盖上。秧苗得到妥善护理，长得非常快，3月初，开始放青了。
    这件事情很快由生产队传遍全公社。这时，人们还没有办秧田浸谷种呢，有些人就不相信官木生的秧苗放了青。可是，当他们来到官木生的试验田，看见秧苗一片青葱，苗根扎得深深的，就都啧啧称赞官木生敢想敢干的共产主义风格了。官木生呢，他非常耐心地给参观者介绍办秧田和护理秧苗的一套经验。人们回去，立即办秧田浸谷种……。到3月末，从长风生产队到全公社的播种工作基本上结束了。官木生算了算，今年早稻播种至少比去年提早十天到半个月。
    依靠群众想办法
    还在播种开始，官木生就注意下秧肥的问题。全队二百多亩秧田，只有30％的田有肥，其余的田，除了依靠绿肥和专业队在外面积肥外，还得发动广大群众起来积肥。但是，提起发动群众积肥，有的干部就觉得不好办，说是年年积肥，肥源挖尽了。官木生相信，只要深入下去，依靠群众，肥料问题是可以解决的。他下手来抓这个工作了。
    官木生到了二小队，看见谷场旁边的地皮呈乌黑色，向社员一打听，知道这里过去打豆子时，有许多叶子落在土中，家禽家畜也时常在这里拉屎撒尿。官木生心想，像这种场子各队都有，又是一个肥源。他和社员把这个队的谷场旁边的地皮挖掉，一天又积了很多的肥……。几天工夫，官木生依靠群众协助，发现了数十种肥源。
  官木生召开了全队干部和积极分子的现场会议，介绍积肥经验。人们听了他的介绍，又看见他的积肥成绩，非常感动，充满信心地说：“只要学习官木生，亲自动手，依靠群众，肥源是挖不完的。”
  　在现场会议的推动下，积肥工作开展起来了。官木生每天参加小队的积肥工作，他是一个战斗员又是一个指挥员。这天，他在一小队积肥，忽然发现有些社员劲头不足，在其他小队也发现有同样的情形，他还看见有些社员把家里很有肥份的污水随便倒掉，而过去这些东西都是倒在粪窖的。官木生非常诧异，和一些社员一交谈，才知道定额不够合理、家庭的小宗肥料没有很好的给以报酬。官木生和支部研究，根据劳力强弱定出合理的定额，同时规定家庭积肥现钱现物报酬的办法。同时，又向社员作了积肥意义的政治动员。社员非常高兴。全队开展了大规模的积肥竞赛运动。
    在竞赛运动中，社员四处找肥源。这天，有的干部给官木生建议：把社员的年代久远不大牢固的房子拆掉，取出陈土当肥，另给社员盖上新房。官木生说：社员的意见怎样呢？干部说拆旧房盖新房，社员哪还有不愿意的。官木生说这件事情还得和社员商量。他召开社员代表会议讨论这个问题。代表们提出：拆旧房盖新房本是好事情，但是现在正是农忙季节，拆掉旧房不可能马上盖起新房，社员得挤在一块居住，这可不大方便。这话引起官木生的注意。他沉吟一会，说：“拆房确实是一个问题，我们这样吧：每人献一条计，解决肥源问题。”代表们欣然地商量起来。末了，他们提出一个意见：有些年代久远的房子的“间垣”（即两个房子之间的一道垣）都有裂痕，甚至倾斜欲倒，可以拆掉当肥，另换新垣。大家觉得这个意见很好：第一，光拆“间垣”换新垣不费多少工夫；第二，保护了房子的安全；第三，拆“间垣”比拆房子搞的肥料还多。于是全体通过拆“间垣”。
    积肥运动正常地发展着。没有多久，积了十余万担肥，秧田的肥料问题基本上解决了。“群众的意见怎样呢？”
    阳光开始温暖了大地，田野充满春天的气息。插秧季节就要到来了。生产队的插秧准备工作进行得很顺利。稻田整得差不多了，照老农的说法，已经达到“田平泥烂”。全队选出的二十五名插秧能手正在训练一批插秧技术较差的社员。现在，官木生感到需要解决的问题就是密植。队的领导干部对于密植有两种意见：一种是主张一亩田插十万蔸，另一种是认为这样太密了。究竟怎样才算做到合理密植呢？“听一听直接领导生产的小队干部的意见吧。”这样一想，官木生找到小队干部交谈起来了。他们告诉他：一亩田插十万蔸太密了，去年有的小队这样做就搞得劳力很紧张，以至有的早稻推迟季节插秧，而且由于过分密植，肥料也供应不上；但是，有些小队实事求是地根据本队的劳力、肥料等情况，一亩田插了四、五万蔸，工作进行很顺利。从这件事情里，他们得出一条经验：一定要合理密植才能多打粮食，但是密到什么程度才算合理，还得看一看客观条件如何——劳力、肥料、季节等是否跟得上？同小队干部谈了以后，给了官木生很大的启发。在队的领导干部会议上，官木生要求主张插十万蔸的人最好先算一算劳力、肥料、季节的账。大家算起账来了。全队有早稻一千零五十亩，专门参加插秧的劳动力约三百多个。如果一亩田插十万蔸，一天可以插三、四十亩田，大约一个月可以把全部早稻插完。但是早稻的插秧季节只有半个月。至于肥料，一亩田还差二三百担。这样一算账，大家觉得插十万蔸办不到。如果一亩田插六、七万蔸，根据现有的劳力，半个月可以把秧插完，正好抢住季节。于是他们初步确定一亩田插六、七万蔸。小队干部对于这样密植，都认为比较符合实际情况。但是，广大群众的意见怎样呢？官木生正在发动大家展开讨论。
