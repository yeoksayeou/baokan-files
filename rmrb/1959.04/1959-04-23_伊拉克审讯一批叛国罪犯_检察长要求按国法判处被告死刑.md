　　Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, April 21st: The Iraqi Supreme Special Military Tribunal, presided over by Colonel Mahdawi, began trying seventeen army officers on the evening of the 20th for plotting a rebellion in Akrah. In a seventy-minute indictment, Prosecutor General Amin accused them of plotting an armed rebellion against the Iraqi government in collaboration with the traitor Shawwaf.

　　The seventeen defendants included former Mosul Garrison Commander Lieutenant Colonel Ali Tawfiq.

　　In the indictment, the Prosecutor General said, "On the evening of March 7th and 8th, 1959, in collaboration with the traitor and criminal Shawwaf and with the cooperation of the UAR authorities, they launched an armed rebellion in Akrah against the legitimate government, attempting to overthrow the republican system explicitly stipulated in the constitution in order to prepare Iraq for annexation into the UAR. Their initial actions were to arrest many citizens, including military personnel and civilians, and send them to Mosul for execution, along with other patriots arrested by Shawwaf. They also opened fire on people who were demonstrating to protest the conspiracy and the conspirators and to defend their democratic republic. As a result, two unarmed demonstrators were injured, and they also issued statements and speeches opposing the democratic republic and supporting the Mosul rebellion."

　　The Prosecutor General said that Tawfiq, Qashimullah, and Debni, among others, had attempted to escape from Iraq but were caught by farmers.

　　The Prosecutor General said that their actions violated Article 22 of the Baghdad Penal Code Amendment and Article 11 of the Military Administrative Regulations, both of which stipulate the death penalty. The Prosecutor General demanded that the court sentence the defendants to death. Peace representatives attending the Second Iraqi Peace Fighters Congress also attended the court hearing. The court president, Mahdawi, welcomed them.

    伊拉克审讯一批叛国罪犯
    检察长要求按国法判处被告死刑
    新华社巴格达21日电　由马赫达维上校主持的伊拉克最高特别军事法庭20日晚上开始审讯在阿克赖策动叛乱的十七名陆军军官。检察长阿明在历时七十分钟的起诉书中提出控告说，他们在卖国贼沙瓦夫的协同下策动反对伊拉克政府的武装叛乱。
    这十七名被告中包括有前摩苏尔驻军司令阿里·陶菲克中校。
    检察长在起诉书中说，“在1959年3月7日到8日的晚上，他们在卖国贼和犯罪分子沙瓦夫的协同并且在阿联当局的合作下在阿克赖发动反对合法政府的武装叛乱，以图推翻宪法明文规定的共和国制度，为使伊拉克并入阿联作好准备。他们最初的活动是逮捕包括军人和平民在内的许多公民，把他们送往摩苏尔处死，和他们同时被处死的有被沙瓦夫逮捕的其他爱国人士。他们还对为了抗议阴谋和阴谋者并且保卫他们的民主共和国而举行示威游行的人开枪。结果有两名手无寸铁的示威游行者受了伤，他们还发表声明和演说反对民主共和国，支持摩苏尔叛乱”。
    检察长说，陶菲克、卡希莫拉和德布尼等三人曾经企图从伊拉克逃走，但是给农民逮住了。
    检察长说，他们的行为违反了巴格达刑法修正案第二十二条和军事行政条例第十一条，这两条都规定要处死刑。检察长要求法庭判处被告死刑。出席伊拉克第二次和平战士代表大会的和平代表们也到法庭旁听。法庭庭长马赫达维对他们表示欢迎。
