Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 25th: Tibetan people in the Shannan area, including Zedang, Naidong, Cangzhu, and other zong and xi, who were just liberated from the ravages of the rebel bandits, have been indignantly accusing the People's Liberation Army and working personnel of a heinous "heart-digging incident" by the rebel bandits. This monstrous crime of the rebel bandits has aroused the boundless anger of the People's Liberation Army and working personnel.

The course of events is as follows: Pingcuo, a tailor and family member of a Tibetan student in Naidong Zong, had a family of five. Two years ago, Pingcuo's eldest daughter, Derui Renzhen, joined the work of the Central Government's Shannan Office in Tibet and later went to study at the Tibetan Public School run by the Central Government. Therefore, the reactionary elements regarded their family as a thorn in their side. After the rebel bandits came to Naidong Zong, they robbed Pingcuo of five "fang" (a "fang" is a standard square piece based on the cloth surface, and the Tibetan cloth trade is measured in "fang") of white cloth that he used to make clothes for others, under the pretext of "buying cloth," and asked him to go to Cangzhu to get the money. After Pingcuo was tricked into going to Cangzhu, the rebel bandits said that he was a so-called "Han Chinese spy," locked him up, and subjected him to all kinds of cruel torture, forcing him to admit the charges that were forced on him. Pingcuo did not admit this absurd charge. The inhuman bandits used the most vicious means to dig out Pingcuo's heart, hang the dug-out heart by his mouth, and throw his body at the entrance of the village to threaten the masses.

The rebel bandits' inhuman crime made the broad masses feel grief and indignation. Many ordinary people wept for Pingcuo's murder. Later, the people secretly buried Pingcuo's body.

After this incident occurred, the Naidong Zong government under the original Tibetan local government not only did not punish the murderers and properly settle the family members of the deceased, but colluded with the rebel bandits to seal up all of Pingcuo's property and send five pieces of clothing from Pingcuo's house to the local temples that participated in the rebellion. Not even a grain of food was left for the children, leaving them displaced. Zezha, who was fifteen years old, became a servant in someone else's home, and the thirteen-year-old and ten-year-old children had to borrow and beg from others to make a living.

After the rebel bandits in Naidong Zong were eliminated, the local military control commission immediately provided relief and resettlement to Pingcuo's three children and returned all of his family property. The three children were filled with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy, and they all wept bitterly when they recalled the past. Zezha, who was already sensible, said angrily: He must support the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion and avenge his father, who died tragically in the hands of the rebel bandits.

During the Lhasa rebellion, Tibetan rebel elements burned, killed, robbed, and harmed the people everywhere. This is the Lhasa Mosque that was doused with gasoline and set on fire by the rebel elements. Now, Muslims have to worship on this ruins. (Photo by Zhang Hesong, reporter of Xinhua News Agency)

    灭绝人性令人发指
    西藏叛匪挖心杀人罪恶滔天
    山南地区藏族人民悲愤交加向解放军控诉
    新华社拉萨25日电　刚从叛匪蹂躏下解放出来的山南地区泽当、乃东、仓珠等宗、溪的藏族人民，向人民解放军和工作人员悲愤地控诉了叛匪一件令人发指的“挖心事件”。叛匪的这个滔天罪行激起人民解放军和工作人员的无比愤怒。
    事情的经过是这样：乃东宗一个藏族学员的家属裁缝平措，家中有五口人。两年前平措的大女儿德瑞仁真参加了中央驻西藏山南机关的工作，后又前往中央办的西藏公学学习，因此，反动分子就把他们一家人视为眼中钉。叛乱分子来到乃东宗后，便以“买布”为名，抢走了平措给别人做衣服的五方白布（一方是以布面为标准的正方一块，西藏布匹买卖以方为单位），要他到仓珠地方去拿钱。平措被骗到仓珠后，叛匪就说他是所谓“汉人间谍”，把他关了起来，并施用种种残酷刑罚，追逼他承认硬加给他的罪名。平措不承认这个荒唐的罪名，灭绝人性的匪徒们竟用最毒辣的手段，将平措的心挖了出来，并将挖出的心挂在他的口边，连同他的尸体抛在村头的路口，以此来威胁群众。
    叛匪这种灭绝人性的罪行，使广大群众悲愤交加，许多老百姓都为平措的被残害流泪哭泣。后来，老百姓们偷偷地埋葬了平措的尸体。
    这件事件发生后，原西藏地方政府所辖的乃东宗政府不但不惩办凶犯、妥善安置死者家属，反而和叛匪勾结在一起，查封了平措的全部家产，并将平措家里的五件衣服送给了当地参加叛乱的寺庙，连一粒粮食都没有给孩子们留下，使孩子们流离失所。十五岁的则扎给别人家当了佣人，十三岁和十岁的孩子只好向别人借贷和乞讨度日。
    乃东宗的叛匪被肃清后，当地军管会立即对平措的三个孩子进行了救济和安置，并且归还了他家的全部财产。三个孩子悲喜交集，提起往事都痛哭流涕。已经懂事的则扎愤怒地表示：一定要支援人民解放军平定叛乱，为他惨死在叛匪手中的父亲报仇。（附图片）
    西藏叛乱分子在拉萨叛乱期间，到处烧杀抢劫，残害人民。这是被叛乱分子浇洒汽油，放火烧毁的拉萨清真寺。现在，伊斯兰教徒们只得在这一片废墟上作礼拜。　　　　　　　新华社记者　张赫嵩摄
