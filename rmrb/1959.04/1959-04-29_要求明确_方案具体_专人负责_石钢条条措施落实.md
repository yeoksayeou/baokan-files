　　Clear Requirements, Specific Plans, Dedicated Personnel
　　Shijiazhuang Steel's Measures Implemented Item by Item
　　(Our Newspaper News) To ensure the realization of the Great Leap Forward plan, the Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Company, while vigorously grasping measures, adopted the method of five "definitive's" - definitive projects, definitive plans, definitive schedules, definitive responsible persons, and definitive results - to ensure that each measure was implemented. This greatly accelerated the realization of the measures and truly grounded this year's Great Leap Forward plan.
　　When discussing this year's national plan, the company's employees put forward more than two thousand measures to guarantee the plan's realization. To change the past practice of only having measure titles without clear requirements and specific plans, this time, the company leadership organized multiple technical thematic debates. Through debate, they formulated technical plans for realizing various major measures. At the same time, according to the size and complexity of the measures, they were assigned to the company, factories and mines, workshops, sections, and groups to organize and implement, and specific schedule requirements and responsible persons were determined according to the degree of importance and urgency. The "five definitive's" were proposed on this basis.
　　After implementing the "five definitive's", the company saw that workers clearly understood the significance of realizing each measure. Therefore, from leaders to the masses, from management cadres to production workers and technicians, everyone demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and initiative, doing everything possible to realize the measures, which quickly brought various production indicators to the level of the Great Leap Forward plan. According to statistics, in March alone, 824 of the company's 1,590 measures were realized, including 130 major projects. The implementation of the "five definitive's" in the iron smelting plant quickly realized the three major measures of increasing smelting intensity, external furnace lime desulfurization, and water washing ore. Increasing smelting intensity alone increased the average daily production of pig iron by 10% compared to the average daily production in March. After the transportation department "definitized" the 365 measures to improve transportation efficiency, the masses launched a competition to realize the measures, and all of these measures were realized in March.
　　To seize the implementation of major measures on the basis of the "five definitive's", the company also adopted the method of leading cadres going to the front line and working with technicians and veteran workers in a "three-way combination" to tackle major measures, which quickly resolved many problems.

    要求明确  方案具体  专人负责
    石钢条条措施落实
    本报讯　石景山钢铁公司为了保证跃进计划的实现，在大抓措施的同时，采取定项目、定方案、定进度、定负责人、定效果五定的办法，使条条措施落实，因而大大加速了措施的实现，使今年的跃进计划真正落了实。
    这个公司的职工在讨论今年国家计划的时候，曾提出两千多条保证计划实现的措施。为了改变过去那种只有措施题目，而无明确要求和具体方案的作法，这次，公司领导方面组织了多次技术专题辩论会，通过辩论，制订出实现各项重大措施的技术方案。同时，他们还按照措施的大小和复杂程度，分别交由公司、厂矿、车间、工段、小组负责组织实现，并根据轻重缓急，确定了具体的进度要求和负责人。“五定”，就是在这样的基础上被提出来的。
    这个公司在实行“五定”以后，由于工人群众清楚地了解到实现每项措施的意义，因此，从领导到群众，从管理干部到生产工人和技术人员，都发挥了高度的积极性和主动精神，千方百计实现措施，因而使各项生产指标很快达到跃进计划的水平。据统计，仅在3月份一个月内，全公司一千五百九十项措施，就实现了八百二十四项，其中重大项目有一百三十项。炼铁厂实行“五定”的结果，迅速实现了提高冶炼强度、炉外白灰脱硫、水洗矿石等三大措施，仅提高冶炼强度一项，就使生铁的平均日产量较3月份平均日产量提高10％。运输部将提高运输效率的三百六十五项措施“五定”以后，群众展开了实现措施的竞赛，3月份已将这些措施全部实现。
    为了抓紧实现重大措施，在“五定”的基础上，这个公司还采取了领导干部开上第一线，和技术人员、老工人一起，用三结合的办法包打重大措施，使很多问题迅速得到了解决。
