    Three Armies Compete for Championship
    At dawn on March 5th, members of the Xizhou Brigade of the Aikou People's Commune in Xingzi County, Jiangxi, carrying manure baskets, hoes, and shovels, headed straight for Huawutang to dredge pond mud. In an instant, they split into three armies, lined up, and started the competition.
    On one side were the thirty-seven members of the "Huang Jiguang" shock brigade, formed last year; on the other side were the sixty-four middle-aged and elderly people forming the "Mixed Army"; and in the middle were the fifty-two women forming the "Liu Hulan" shock brigade. People were digging, shoveling, loading, and carrying. The "Liu Hulan" team proposed: each person should accumulate a hundred loads of fertilizer per day, striving to be number one in the entire brigade. The "Huang Jiguang" team proposed: to have the spirit of charging and breaking through, and win the championship on the fertilizer accumulation battlefield. The "Mixed Army" was not to be outdone, shouting to learn from "Old Huang Zhong." The members of the "Liu Hulan" team were all tightly dressed, and those carrying fertilizer ran off before it was even fully loaded. The young men of the "Huang Jiguang" team, wearing only shirts and shorts, were full of energy. Communist Youth League members Zhou Chongxun and Zhou Chongyu each used a thick carrying pole, carrying six full manure baskets of fertilizer at a time, running back and forth. The "Mixed Army" was divided into groups of three, one person loading, and two people carrying.
    The result of the competition that day was that the three armies were neck and neck. A total of sixty-three thousand loads of pond mud were carried, an average of four hundred loads per person.

    三路兵马争冠军
    3月5日拂晓，江西星子县隘口公社西洲大队的社员们，挑着粪箕带着锄头和铁锹，直奔花屋塘去挑塘泥。顷刻间，分成三路兵马一齐拉开阵势，展开了竞赛。
    这边是三十七名在去年就组成的“黄继光”突击队，那边是六十四名中年人、老年人组成的“混合军”，中间是五十二名妇女组成的“刘胡兰”突击队。人们挖的挖、铲的铲，装的装、挑的挑。“刘胡兰”队提出：每人日积百担肥，争取全大队数第一。“黄继光”队提出：要有冲锋破阵的精神，积肥战场上夺冠军。“混合军”也不甘示弱，高喊要学习“老黄忠”。“刘胡兰”队里个个紧扎紧装，挑肥的人没等装好就挑跑了。“黄继光”队的青年小伙子，身穿单衣短裤，个个干劲十足。共青团员周崇训、周崇玉，各自使用一根老粗的扁担，一次挑着满满六粪箕肥料，来往飞跑。“混合军”分成三人一组，一人装，两人挑。
    这一天的竞赛结果，三路兵马并驾齐驱。总共挑塘泥六万三千担，平均每人四百担。
