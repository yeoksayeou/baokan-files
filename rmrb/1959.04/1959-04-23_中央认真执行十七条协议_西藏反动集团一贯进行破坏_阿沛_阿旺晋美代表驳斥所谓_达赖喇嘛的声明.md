Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I completely agree with and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1959 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
    Under the wise and correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have achieved tremendous accomplishments in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture during the first Five-Year Plan for national economic construction, especially in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, greatly enhancing our country's international prestige. The 1959 National Economic Plan, formulated on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, is another Great Leap Forward plan. When every patriotic person sees their great motherland leaping forward with such magnificent strides, they will naturally feel infinitely honored and proud. (Enthusiastic applause)

    The Tibetan people can only achieve true happiness by practicing national regional autonomy and following the path of democracy and socialism in the great family of the motherland.

    Tibet is an inseparable part of China's territory, (applause) and the Tibetan people can only achieve true happiness by practicing national regional autonomy and following the path of democracy and socialism in the equal, united, friendly, and mutually supportive great family of all ethnic groups in the motherland. Any attempt to take any other path will only bring endless disasters to themselves. Therefore, according to the Agreement between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan Local Government on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet in 1951, the Tibetan people's return to the great family of the motherland signifies that the Tibetan people have embarked on the path of brightness and happiness. (Applause) However, the former Tibetan Local Government and the upper-class reactionary clique have consistently colluded with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to obstruct the implementation of the agreement, such as obstructing the implementation of democratic reforms, resisting the reorganization of the Tibetan army, and being unwilling to implement national regional autonomy with the participation of the people. As matters developed recently, they have even more brazenly dared to gather a large number of bandits in Lhasa, kidnap the Dalai Lama, and launch armed attacks on the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa and the central government's agencies in Tibet, attempting to realize their dream of relying on imperialism to enslave the Tibetan people forever. After the rebellion occurred, the State Council immediately issued an order on March 28 to dissolve the former local government and have the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercise the functions and powers of the local government, and to order the troops of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the rebellion and to remove the rebel elements Sokang Wangqing Gelai and others from their positions as members of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and all other positions. This is in line with the interests of the Tibetan people and is therefore completely correct, and has been immediately and wholeheartedly supported by the broad masses of the Tibetan people. (Enthusiastic applause) With the active support and assistance of the broad masses of the Tibetan people, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet have not only thoroughly quelled the rebellion in Lhasa and other important areas in a very short period of time, but also the fleeing bandits in other remote areas are expected to be completely annihilated in the near future. (Enthusiastic applause)

    The Central Government has always earnestly implemented the Seventeen-Article Agreement and the policy of national equality and unity; the Tibetan people live together with the PLA troops entering Tibet like family members.

    Here, I would like to say a few words about the statement issued to the press in Tezpur, India, on April 18 in the name of the Dalai Lama.
    I am not only a member of the Tibetan landlord class, but also held official rank in the former Tibetan Local Government for many years, especially as a Kalon of the government for ten years. In 1951, I was the chief plenipotentiary representative of the Tibetan Local Government in negotiations with the Central People's Government. When the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established in 1956, I served as the Secretary-General of the committee. Therefore, I have been closely informed about all the work in Tibet in recent years from beginning to end. I am also relatively familiar with the long history of Tibet.

    Tibet is Chinese territory. This is evidenced by approximately seven hundred years of historical records. Here, I will focus on a brief account of the situation from 1951 to the present.

    In 1951, the former Tibetan Local Government, led by the Dalai Lama, sent our five plenipotentiary representatives to Beijing via Kangqu and India. After the two groups met in Beijing, they held detailed discussions with the central government's plenipotentiary representatives on a cordial and friendly basis. After obtaining a unanimous agreement that satisfied both parties, the Seventeen-Article Agreement was signed.

    After the agreement was reached, the People's Liberation Army and staff members who entered Tibet to consolidate national defense, under the leadership of the central government's representative in Tibet, earnestly observed and implemented the Seventeen-Article Agreement and the policy of national equality and unity, and achieved remarkable results. For example, before the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Tibetan people had great fears due to the rampant rumors fabricated by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. However, now the Tibetan people treat the People's Liberation Army like their own parents and children, helping each other and living together like a family. This is a fact that everyone can see. Taking Tibet's construction as an example, the central government has invested manpower and money to build thousands of kilometers of highways, solving the difficulty of inconvenient transportation for the Tibetan people. Moreover, the construction of highways was originally the Tibetan people's own affair, but if the highways passed through the people's farmland, the central government purchased the occupied portion at a high price. In addition, hospitals were established in major cities and towns, providing free medical treatment; many primary and secondary schools were established. In short, in helping to develop Tibet's economy, culture, and other aspects, many things beneficial to the Tibetan people have been done. These are also facts that everyone can see. Politically, before the open armed rebellion occurred in Lhasa, the original powers of the former Tibetan Local Government and the original status and powers of the Dalai Lama remained unchanged in accordance with the agreement. Officials at all levels also continued to serve in their posts as usual, and the central government never imposed any coercion on the political rights and work of the former Tibetan Local Government. According to the agreement, the Tibetan local troops should be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army, and Tibet's very backward system must be reformed. However, due to the disagreement of the former Tibetan Local Government and the upper-class reactionary clique, the central government, based on a broad policy and emphasizing unity, gave them ample time for full consideration. Not only was the Tibetan army never reorganized, and the system was not reformed in the slightest, but the Tibetan Local Government never stopped issuing Tibetan currency. The central government proposed the idea of implementing national regional autonomy in Tibet. After everyone agreed, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established in April 1956, with the Dalai Lama serving as the chairman to lead it. Not only were most of the staff below him Tibetan, but most of the officials of the former Tibetan Local Government were also arranged positions in the Preparatory Committee with reference to their original official positions. The expenses of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region and its subordinate institutions were all provided by the central government. The central government and the People's Liberation Army conscientiously respected freedom of religious belief, protected Lama temples, and respected customs and habits. No temple in the Tibetan region has ever been damaged. In short, the central government has always earnestly implemented the Seventeen-Article Agreement and the policy of national equality and unity, without committing the slightest offense. This has been confirmed by the personal experience of the Tibetan people. (Enthusiastic applause)

    The former Tibetan Local Government and the upper-class reactionary clique colluded with imperialism, undermined national unity, consistently obstructed the implementation of the Seventeen-Article Agreement, and then launched a rebellion.

    As mentioned above, the central government's various policies towards Tibet in recent years have been correct. Whatever was done, it prompted the Tibetan people to get rid of their backward and dark situation and become increasingly aware. The Tibetan people have thus become increasingly clear that they will gain a new life in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. However, the former Tibetan Local Government and the upper-class reactionary clique were intent on keeping the Tibetan people under the long-term rule of the backward feudal serf system. Therefore, when they saw the Tibetan people gradually awakening, they panicked and turned to colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries. On the surface, they hypocritically put on a posture of advocating unity and abiding by the agreement, but at their core, they attempted to rely on the power of imperialism and reactionaries to undermine the unity of the motherland, thereby restoring the aggressive forces of imperialism in Tibet and maintaining their cruel exploitation of the Tibetan people under the feudal serf system. In order to achieve this shameful goal, they carried out a series of conspiracies. For example, implementing the provisions of Article 8 of the agreement, namely, "The Tibetan army shall be gradually reorganized into the People's Liberation Army and become a part of the national defense armed forces of the People's Republic of China," would reduce the heavy burden on the Tibetan people, because the original local government only shouldered a small portion of the Tibetan army's provisions, and clothing and other items were directly supplied by the people. But the reactionary elements have consistently obstructed this. For example, the broad masses of the Tibetan people, as well as some upper and middle-level progressives, were eager to change Tibet's backward feudal serf system step by step according to Article 11 of the agreement, namely, "The Tibetan Local Government should automatically carry out reforms." The reactionary elements also tried every means to obstruct this. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established on the basis of progress. Because its progress violated the wishes of those reactionary elements, they did everything possible to prevent the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region from making any progress and carried out terrorist oppression against some progressives. The People's Liberation Army and staff members stationed in Tibet have consistently implemented a policy of freedom of religious belief in Tibet and have not committed the slightest offense against any temple. In some Tibetan areas of neighboring provinces, some temples have even become the headquarters of bandits because reactionary elements launched armed rebellions against the country and the people. In suppressing the rebellion, these temples were inevitably damaged. The reactionary elements in Tibet took the opportunity to exaggerate and distort this, saying that they "wanted to destroy the temples," etc., spreading rumors and confusing the public, and so on. In May and June of last year, they even more brazenly gathered bandits who had fled from various provinces to Tibet and carried out armed rebellions in the areas along the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River. Until then, the central government still fully respected the former Tibetan Local Government and repeatedly ordered it to quell the armed rebellions in its affiliated areas. However, in addition to acknowledging it verbally and making a superficial show, the former local government did everything possible to support the armed bandits behind the scenes. Developing to the point where, recently, a large number of bandits were concentrated in Lhasa. Because they could not find any excuses for all the central government's measures, they used the fact that the Dalai Lama had decided to go to the Tibet Military Region to see a play to spread rumors and confuse the public. The course of this matter was that, a month ago, the Dalai Lama himself proposed to go to the Tibet Military Region to see a play, and the date of March 10 was also chosen by the Dalai Lama himself. However, the reactionary elements deceived the masses of Lhasa City, saying that inviting the Dalai Lama to the military region to see a play was to forcibly take him to the interior, etc., in a shameless lie, and officially began their criminal acts of undermining unity and national reunification. On the same day, Soilang Jiangcuo, the brother of Pabala Hutuktu, the main leader of Changdu Prefecture, and a member of the Religious Affairs Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, was killed at the gate of the Dalai Lama's residence, Norbulingka. Sangpo Tenzin Dronduup, deputy commander of the Tibet Military Region, was wounded, and the inner and outer walls of the Dalai Lama's residence were occupied by armed forces. This was truly lawless to the extreme. However, the central government still maintained a broad-minded attitude and, starting from the desire for unity, requested the former Tibetan Local Government to correct its mistakes and find ways to quell the rebellion. In order to help the Dalai Lama, General Tan Guansan, the acting central government representative in Tibet, wrote three letters to the Dalai Lama, two of which I personally forwarded. The Dalai Lama also forwarded three handwritten letters in reply through me. The letters detailed the various coercions the Dalai Lama was suffering from the bandits. Sure enough, on the evening of March 17, the Dalai Lama was kidnapped by the bandits and taken away. Then, starting at 3:40 a.m. on March 20, the bandits launched an armed attack on the various units of the People's Liberation Army in Lhasa and the central government's agencies in Tibet. In order to defend the unity of the motherland and the safety of the Tibetan people, the People's Liberation Army had to launch a counterattack at 10:00 a.m. Beijing time on March 20. With the sincere support of the broad masses of the Tibetan people, the rebellion in the Lhasa area was quelled in a very short period of time. Before this, the People's Liberation Army had never fired a single bullet, as can be proved by all the monks and laypeople of Lhasa City. Summarizing the above facts, it is clear at a glance who has been abiding by and implementing the Seventeen-Article Agreement from beginning to end, and who has been undermining the agreement. (Enthusiastic applause)

    The rapid suppression of the rebellion is in line with the interests of the 1.1 million people of Tibet. The Tibetan people will embark on the socialist road of prosperity, like the people of all other ethnic groups in the country.

    The armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan Local Government and the upper-class reactionary clique, betraying the motherland, betraying the people, and undermining the unity of the motherland, has been completely quelled in the Lhasa area and other important areas. Small groups of bandits who have fled to remote mountainous areas are still being pursued and suppressed and are expected to be completely suppressed in a short period of time. Of the approximately 1.2 million people in Tibet today, only about 20,000 participated in the rebellion. The Tibetan people clearly know that the rapid suppression of the rebellion is in line with the interests of the 1.1 million people of Tibet. Otherwise, the broad masses of the Tibetan people will have to endure all kinds of suffering for a long time. Because since the small-scale rebellion began last year, almost a year ago, the bandits have looted everything wherever they went. By the spring plowing season this year, many farmers who had been robbed were unable to plant their fields, and there was burning, killing, and looting, which was intolerable. Moreover, as a result, it is difficult for the Tibetan people to get rid of the cruel exploitation of the feudal serf owners. At a time when the power of the people in the world is so great that no force can stop it, the Tibetan people will, on the basis of this great victory, establish the Tibet Autonomous Region as soon as possible, correctly implement social reforms suitable to the specific conditions of Tibet, so that the Tibetan people, like the people of all other ethnic groups in the country, can embark on the happy and prosperous road of democracy and socialism, fully develop their political, economic, cultural, and other aspects of life, thereby developing the population and building a new Tibet. (Applause)

    Since the Dalai Lama assumed power, I have followed him closely, always in accordance with his wishes and wholeheartedly supporting him, so I can understand the Dalai Lama's wishes. In the past eight years, whether in public speeches or in private conversations with our Tibetan officials, we have never heard him say anything about "Tibetan independence" or splitting the motherland. What we have heard is that he is not only deeply concerned about the happiness of the Tibetan people, but also more concerned about the ever-increasing consolidation and strengthening of the unity of the motherland. Therefore, we can completely conclude that the statement issued in India in the name of the Dalai Lama was definitely not from the Dalai Lama's own will. (Applause) Moreover, judging from the tone of the statement, it is not at all like the Dalai Lama's, nor does it seem to have been written by Tibetans in Tibetan. It is more like a foreigner wrote it and imposed it on the Dalai Lama. (Applause) I think that when the Dalai Lama sits quietly and contemplates, he will feel the pain of being kidnapped and used, and thereby find the correct measures and methods to get rid of being kidnapped. (Applause)

    I believe that the people of the world will sympathize with the 1.1 million people of Tibet who are striving to get rid of the severe exploitation of the feudal serf system, and will not sympathize with a small group of bandits who once sucked the blood and sweat of the Tibetan people and have now become national scum.

    I don't have any special knowledge, but I know that all kind people will distinguish between what is good and what is evil, what is true and what is false, what is just and what is distorted. Therefore, I believe that the people of the world will sympathize with the 1.1 million people of Tibet who are striving to get rid of the severe exploitation of the feudal serf system, and will not sympathize with a small group of bandits who once sucked the blood and sweat of the Tibetan people and have now become national scum. (Applause)

    To the bandits who have fled into India, in consideration of the fact that we are of the same ethnic group, I want to place my hope on you that, in order to prevent the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people from being separated for a long time, I hope you will not continue to do evil under the manipulation and use of imperialism, Chiang gang agents, and foreign reactionaries, and block the Dalai Lama's path back to the motherland. Secondly, the reason why you have abandoned your homes and fled to other countries is that you can say that it is because the Central People's Government no longer allows you to continue to suck the blood and sweat of the Tibetan people that has been sucked for thousands of years. If you want to say that it is for the happiness of the Tibetan people, then the facts are exactly the opposite, and the result will only be met with the firm opposition of the Tibetan people. (Applause) Finally, as long as you correct your mistakes, start anew, and no longer engage in criminal activities of betraying the motherland, the Tibetan people can still forgive you, and the Central People's Government will give you lenient treatment. (Enthusiastic applause)

    The former Tibetan Local Government and the upper-class reactionary clique launched an armed rebellion in an attempt to lead the Tibetan people into a disastrous path of continued enslavement. They never thought and could not have thought that the suppression of the rebellion would bring a new life to the Tibetan people. (Enthusiastic applause) In the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, through the active preparations of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, we must implement national regional autonomy in Tibet, and, through democratic reforms, take the socialist road like the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and build a prosperous and happy new Tibet! (Long and enthusiastic applause)

    Finally, let me shout:
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party! (Enthusiastic applause)
    Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in China! (Enthusiastic applause)
    Long live the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao! (Long and enthusiastic applause)

专栏：

    中央认真执行十七条协议  西藏反动集团一贯进行破坏
    阿沛·阿旺晋美代表驳斥所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护周总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    在伟大的中国共产党和各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席英明正确的领导下，我国各族人民在国民经济建设的第一个五年计划期间，特别是在一九五八年的大跃进中，无论在政治、经济、文化各方面都取得了十分巨大的成就，使我国的国际威望大大提高。在一九五八年大跃进的基础上所拟定的一九五九年的国民经济计划，又是一个大跃进的计划。当每一个爱国人民看到自己的伟大祖国，以如此雄伟壮阔的步伐飞跃前进的时候，都会很自然地感到无限光荣和自豪。（热烈鼓掌）
    西藏人民只有在祖国大家庭中，实行民族的地方自治，走民主和社会主义的道路才会得到真正的幸福
    西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，（鼓掌）西藏人民只有在祖国各族人民平等、团结、友爱、互助的大家庭中，实行民族的地方自治，走民主和社会主义道路才会得到真正的幸福，如果企图走别的任何道路只会给自己带来无穷无尽的灾难。因而根据一九五一年中央人民政府与西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，西藏人民回到祖国大家庭中来，是表示西藏人民走上光明幸福的大道。（鼓掌）但是，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团一贯勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派阻挠协议的执行，例如：阻挠实行民主改革，抗拒改编藏军，不愿实行有人民参加的民族地方自治等等。事态发展到最近，他们更变本加厉地敢于在拉萨纠集大批叛匪，劫持达赖喇嘛，向在拉萨的人民解放军部队和中央派驻西藏的机关发动武装进攻，企图实现他们投靠帝国主义，永远奴役西藏人民的梦想。叛乱发生后，国务院即于三月二十八日发布命令解散原地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府职权，责成人民解放军西藏军区部队彻底平息叛乱，撤销叛乱分子索康·旺青格勒等在西藏自治区筹备委员会委员及其他一切职务，这是符合西藏人民的利益的，从而也是完全正确的，立即得到西藏广大人民的竭诚拥护。（热烈鼓掌）在西藏广大人民的积极支持和帮助下，人民解放军驻西藏部队不仅在很短的时期内彻底平息了拉萨等各重要地区的叛乱，而且逃窜至其他偏僻地区的叛匪，也可望于最近时期内彻底歼灭。（热烈鼓掌）
    中央一贯认真执行十七条协议和民族平等团结的政策；西藏人民对待进藏的解放军亲如家人地生活在一起
    在这里，我想对四月十八日在印度提斯浦尔地方以达赖喇嘛的名义向新闻界所发表的声明说几句话。
    我不仅是西藏地主阶级的一员，而且在原西藏地方政府据有官品，供职多年，特别是当了十年的政府噶伦。一九五一年同中央人民政府谈判，我是西藏地方政府的首席全权代表。一九五六年成立西藏自治区筹备委员会，我担任委员会的秘书长。因此，对西藏近几年来的所有工作，自始至终我都详细了解。对于西藏年代久远的历史，我也比较熟悉。
    西藏是中国的领土。这有七百年左右的历史资料可以证明。这里着重叙述一下自一九五一年到现在的简略情况。
    一九五一年由达赖喇嘛领导的原西藏地方政府，派我们五名全权代表经康区和绕道印度两路前往北京。等到两路人员在北京会齐后，就与中央的几位全权代表在亲切友好的基础上，经过详细讨论，取得双方都满意的一致意见后，签订了协议十七条。
    协议达成后，为巩固国防而进入西藏的人民解放军和工作人员到达西藏，在中央驻藏代表的领导下，认真遵守和执行十七条协议和民族平等团结的政策，取得了显著的成绩。例如：在西藏和平解放前，由于帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮疯狂地制造种种谣言，西藏人民存在着很大的惧怕心理。但是，现在西藏人民对待人民解放军犹如自己的父母子女，互相帮助，象一家人一样地生活在一起。这是有目共睹的事实。如以西藏的建设为例，中央出人出钱修筑了几千公里的公路，为西藏人民解除了交通不便的困难。不仅如此，兴修公路本来是西藏人民自己的事情，但如公路通过民田，中央则以高价收买公路所占去的部分。此外在各大城镇都成立了医院，免费治病；成立了许多小学和中学。总之，在帮助发展西藏的经济、文化等各方面，作了许多有利于西藏人民的事情。这些也是有目共睹的事实。政治方面，在拉萨未发生公开的武装叛乱前，根据协议，原西藏地方政府的原有职权和达赖喇嘛的原有地位和职权都照旧未变，各级官员也是照常供职，对原西藏地方政府的政治权利和工作，中央从未加以任何强制。根据协议，西藏地方部队应改编为人民解放军，西藏的那种非常落后的制度必须予以改革。但是，由于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团不同意，中央本着宽大政策，以团结为重，给他们以充分考虑的宽裕时间，不但藏军始终没有改编，制度丝毫没有改革，而且西藏地方政府还始终没有停发过藏钞。中央提出在西藏实行民族地方自治的意见，经大家同意后，于一九五六年四月间成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，并由达赖喇嘛担任主任委员为其领导，以下的工作人员不仅大部分是藏族，而且原西藏地方政府的大部分官员，也都参照他们的原有官职，在筹委会安排了职位。自治区筹备委员会及其下属机构的经费都由中央供给。中央和人民解放军认真尊重宗教信仰自由，保护喇嘛寺庙，尊重风俗习惯，西藏地区的任何一个寺院从未受到任何破坏。总之，中央一贯认真执行十七条协议和民族平等团结的政策，秋毫无犯。这是西藏人民的亲身体验所证实了的。（热烈鼓掌）
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义，破坏祖国统一，一贯阻挠十七条协议的执行，并进而发动叛乱
    如上所述，几年来中央对西藏的各项政策都是正确的，无论办任何一件事情，都促使西藏人民摆脱落后黑暗的境地，日益醒悟起来。西藏人民从而日益清楚地看到自己在政治、经济、文化各方面将得到新的生活。但是原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团一心想使西藏人民长期处于落后的封建农奴制的统治之下。因而当他们看到西藏人民逐渐觉醒时就惊慌起来，转而勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派。在外表上假惺惺地装出一种主张团结和遵守协议的姿态，其骨底里则是企图依靠帝国主义和反动派的力量，来破坏祖国的统一，从而在西藏恢复帝国主义的侵略势力，以维持他们对西藏人民实行封建农奴制度的残酷剥削。为了实现他们这种可耻的目的，他们曾进行了一系列阴谋活动。例如：执行协议第八条所规定的事项，即“西藏军队逐步改编为人民解放军，成为中华人民共和国国防武装的一部分”，这样可以减轻西藏人民的苛重负担，因为西藏军队的给养原地方政府只负担很少一部分，服装以及其他用项都由人民直接供给。但反动分子对此一贯进行阻挠。又如：西藏广大人民以及一些上层和中层的进步人士都渴望根据协议第十一条，即“西藏地方政府应自动进行改革”，逐步改变西藏的落后的封建农奴制度。反动分子们对此也千方百计地予以阻挠。西藏自治区筹备委员会是在进步的基础上成立的。因其进步就违背了那些反动分子的意愿，因而尽一切力量使西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作不能有所进展，并且对一些进步人士实行恐怖压迫。中央派驻西藏的人民解放军和工作人员，在西藏一贯实行宗教信仰自由政策，对任何寺庙都秋毫无犯。在邻省的某些藏族地区，由于反动分子发动反对国家反对人民的武装叛乱，有些寺庙甚至直接变成叛匪的司令部。在镇压叛乱时对这些寺庙不免有所损伤。西藏的反动分子就借此加以夸大和歪曲，说什么“要毁灭寺庙”等等，造谣惑众，不一而足。到去年五、六月间，更变本加厉地纠集从邻省各地逃到西藏的叛匪，在沿雅鲁藏布江两岸地区实行武装叛乱。直到那时中央还是十分尊重原西藏地方政府，再三责令它平息所属地区的武装叛乱。但是，原地方政府除了口头上承认，并在表面上作作样子以外，其内幕则是尽一切力量支持武装叛匪，发展到最近，将大批叛匪集中到拉萨。由于他们对中央的一切措施，找不到任何借口，就利用达赖喇嘛决定到西藏军区看戏这件事，造谣惑众。这件事情的经过情况是，在一个月以前达赖喇嘛自己提出要到西藏军区看戏，三月十日这个日期也是达赖喇嘛自己选定的。但是，反动分子欺骗拉萨市群众，说什么请达赖喇嘛到军区看戏，是要将他强行带到内地去等等无耻谎言，正式开始了他们破坏团结和祖国统一的罪恶行径。就在当天，在达赖喇嘛的住地罗布林卡门口杀死了昌都地区的主要领袖人物帕巴拉呼图克图的哥哥、西藏自治区筹备委员会宗教事务委员会委员索朗降措，打伤了西藏军区副司令员桑颇·才旺仁增，武装占领了达赖喇嘛住地的内外围墙，真是无法无天到了极点。但是，中央方面仍然宽大为怀，从团结的愿望出发，要求原西藏地方政府改正错误，设法平息叛乱。为了帮助达赖喇嘛，代理中央驻藏代表谭冠三将军前后给达赖喇嘛写了三封信，其中两封还是由我亲自转的。达赖喇嘛也通过我转了他亲笔写的三封回信。在信中写着达赖喇嘛在受叛匪种种胁迫的详细情况。果然到三月十七日晚间，达赖喇嘛被叛匪劫持而去。以后到三月二十日清晨三点四十分钟开始，叛匪就向在拉萨的人民解放军各部队和中央派驻西藏的机关实行武装进攻。为了保卫祖国的统一和西藏人民的安全，人民解放军不得不在三月二十日当天上午北京时间十点钟开始予以反击。在西藏广大人民的竭诚支援下，在很短的时间内平息了拉萨地区的叛乱。在这以前人民解放军从未放过一粒子弹，这由拉萨市的全体僧俗人民可以证明。总括以上事实，自始至终究竟谁在遵守和执行协议十七条，和谁在破坏协议，可以一目了然。（热烈鼓掌）
    叛乱的迅速平定合乎西藏一百一十几万人口的利益。西藏人民将和全国其他各族人民一样走上社会主义的康庄大道
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团背叛祖国，背叛人民，破坏祖国统一的武装叛乱，在拉萨地区和其他各重要的地区内已彻底平息，其他逃往偏僻山区的小股叛匪，现正在继续追剿，可望于短时间内彻底平定。西藏现有的一百二十万左右人口，参加叛乱的只有两万左右。西藏人民清楚地知道，叛乱的迅速平定是合乎西藏一百一十几万人口的利益。如若不然，西藏广大人民将要长期忍受种种灾难的煎熬。因为自去年开始小股叛乱到现在将近一年期间，叛匪所到之处洗劫一空，到今年春耕期间就有很多被劫农户无法下种，烧杀淫掠，忍无可忍。不仅如此，其结果西藏人民势难摆脱封建农奴主的残酷剥削。当今世界上人民的力量大到没有任何力量可以阻挡的时候，西藏人民将要在这次伟大胜利的基础上尽快地成立西藏自治区，正确地实行适合于西藏具体情况的社会改革，以使西藏人民也和全国其他各族人民一样走上幸福美满的民主和社会主义康庄大道，充分发展自己的政治、经济、文化等各方面的生活，从而发展人口，建设新西藏。（鼓掌）
    自从达赖喇嘛亲政后，我与达赖喇嘛之间，形影相随，始终一贯地遵从他的意愿，竭诚扶持，因而能体会达赖喇嘛的意愿。达赖喇嘛八年来无论公开讲话，或者对我们藏族官员的私下谈话，我们都没有听到过“西藏独立”、分裂祖国统一的话。我们听到的话是，他不仅深刻关怀西藏人民的幸福，而且更加关心祖国统一的日益巩固和加强。因此我们完全可以断定，这次在印度以达赖喇嘛的名义所发表的声明，绝非出自达赖喇嘛的意愿。（鼓掌）而且从声明的语气看来，完全不是达赖喇嘛的，也不象是西藏人用西藏文写的，倒很象是外国人写起强加在达赖身上的。（鼓掌）我想当达赖喇嘛静坐深思的时候，会感觉被人劫持和利用的痛苦，从而会找出摆脱被劫持的正确措置和办法。（鼓掌）
    相信全世界人民将会同情西藏一百一十几万力求摆脱封建农奴制的惨重剥削的人们，而不同情一小撮曾吸吮西藏人民的血汗、又变成民族败类的叛乱分子
    我没有什么特别知识，但是，我知道一切善良的人们，都会分清何者为善，何者为恶，何者为真，何者为假，何者是公正的，何者是被歪曲了的。因而，我相信全世界人民将会同情西藏一百一十多万力求摆脱封建农奴制的惨重剥削的人们，而不同情一小撮曾吸吮西藏人民的血汗，现在又变成民族败类的叛乱分子。（鼓掌）
    对窜入印度的叛乱分子，看在同一个民族的份上，我要寄托于你们的一线希望是，为了达赖喇嘛和西藏人民不至长期分离，希望你们不要在帝国主义、蒋帮特务和外国反动派的操纵和利用之下，继续作恶，堵绝达赖喇嘛回到祖国的道路。其次，你们抛离家乡、流亡于他国的原因，你们可以说是因为中央人民政府不再允许你们继续吸吮千百年来一直被吸吮着的西藏人民的血汗。如果你们要说是为了西藏人民的幸福，那末事实恰恰与此相反，其结果只会遭到西藏人民的坚决反对。（鼓掌）最后，只要你们改正错误，重新作人，不再进行背叛祖国的罪恶活动，西藏人民还可以宽恕你们，中央人民政府会对你们给以宽大处理的。（热烈鼓掌）
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动武装叛乱，是想把西藏人民引入继续受奴役的灾难道路，他们绝不会想到而且也不可能想到叛乱的平息给西藏人民带来了新生。（热烈鼓掌）今后在中国共产党，毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，经过西藏自治区筹备委员会的积极筹备，一定要在西藏实行民族地方自治，并通过民主改革同全国各族人民一样走社会主义道路，建设繁荣幸福的新西藏！（长时间的热烈掌声）
    最后让我高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！（热烈鼓掌）
    中国各民族人民大团结万岁！（热烈鼓掌）
    各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！（长时间的热烈鼓掌）
