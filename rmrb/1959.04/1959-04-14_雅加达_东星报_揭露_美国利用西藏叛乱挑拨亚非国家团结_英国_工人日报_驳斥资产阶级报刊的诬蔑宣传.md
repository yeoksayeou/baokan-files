Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 13th -- The "Dongxing Daily" published an editorial today stating that, like the rebellion in Indonesia, the Tibetan rebellion was also planned by the United States.

The editorial said that although China has suppressed the Tibetan rebellion, the imperialists are still trying to create new disturbances in Asia so that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact Organization can take the opportunity to send their armed forces to intervene. The editorial said that the imperialists are doing everything possible to sow seeds of discord in the relations between Asian countries and to undermine the unity of Asian and African countries based on the Bandung spirit. The editorial also pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek clique sent special agents to secretly contact the Tibetan rebels.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 13th -- The British "Workers' Daily" published an editorial today condemning the British bourgeois newspapers and the British Broadcasting Corporation for using the Tibetan rebellion to conduct a vicious slanderous propaganda campaign against China. The newspaper pointed out that this conspiracy to undermine the British people's friendly feelings towards China is doomed to failure. The "Workers' Daily" said that the British bourgeois newspapers are using three lies to deceive the British people.

The first lie is: "Tibet is not part of China, but an independent country." The "Workers' Daily" said, however, that Tibet is as much a part of China as Scotland or Wales is part of Britain.

The second lie is: "China has carried out aggression in Tibet." However, even the bourgeois newspapers, in their own accounts of what happened, show that the rebels launched the attack on the People's Liberation Army.

The third lie is: "What is happening in Tibet is a national uprising." The "Workers' Daily" pointed out that they are trying to use this lie to cover up the social and class background of the rebellion. The newspaper emphasized that the entire Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, regardless of the nonsense spewed by the Fleet Street (British press) hirelings, will move towards a happy socialist future. China, in its great leap forward, will receive the support of the working people of the world.

　　雅加达“东星报”揭露
　　美国利用西藏叛乱挑拨亚非国家团结
　　英国“工人日报”驳斥资产阶级报刊的诬蔑宣传
    据新华社雅加达13日电　“东星报”今天发表社论说，像印度尼西亚的叛乱事件一样，西藏的叛乱也是美国所策划的。
    社论说，虽然中国已经镇压了西藏的叛乱，然而帝国主义者还企图继续在亚洲制造新的骚乱，以便东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约组织借机派遣它们的武装部队来进行干涉。社论说，帝国主义者竭尽全力在亚洲国家的关系中散播不和的种子，破坏以万隆精神为基础的亚非国家的团结。社论还指出，蒋介石集团派遣了特务同西藏的叛乱分子进行秘密接触。
    据新华社伦敦13日电　英国“工人日报”今天发表社论，谴责了英国资产阶级报纸和英国广播公司利用西藏叛乱事件对中国进行恶毒的诬蔑宣传运动。报纸指出，这种企图破坏英国人民对中国的友好感情的阴谋是注定要失败的。“工人日报”说，英国资产阶级报纸利用三个谎言来欺骗英国人民。
    第一个谎言是：“西藏不是中国的一部分，而是一个独立国家。”“工人日报”说，但是，西藏是中国的一部分，正像苏格兰或威尔士是英国的一部分一样。
    第二个谎言是：“中国在西藏进行了侵略。”但是，甚至资产阶级报纸在它们自己叙述发生了什么事情的时候也表明是叛乱分子发动了对人民解放军的进攻。
    第三个谎言是：“在西藏发生的事情是民族起义。”“工人日报”指出，它们企图用这个谎言来掩盖叛乱的社会背景和阶级背景。报纸强调指出，全体中国人民，包括西藏人民在内，不管舰队街（英国报界）的雇佣文人们发出怎样的胡说八道，将走向幸福的社会主义未来。中国在他们的大踏步的前进中，将得到全世界劳动人民的支持。
