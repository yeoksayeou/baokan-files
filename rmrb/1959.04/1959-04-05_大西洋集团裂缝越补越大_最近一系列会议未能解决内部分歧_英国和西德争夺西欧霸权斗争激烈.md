Xinhua News Agency, London, April 4th: A series of consultations among the North Atlantic group of nations has still failed to resolve the divisions between them.

The result of Macmillan's recent series of talks in Bonn, Paris, and Washington is that the so-called "unity" of the Western countries has become more visibly fractured. The meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, France, the United States, and West Germany in Washington this week also failed to resolve their differing attitudes on issues such as Germany, Europe, and East-West relations.

A large part of the above-mentioned issues they have been discussing will have to be handed over to the "working group" again. This group, established to coordinate Western opinions and prepare for negotiations with the Soviet Union, will resume its work in London before the foreign ministers meet again.

The Conservative newspaper "Daily Mail" said today that the four Western foreign ministers had been negotiating in an atmosphere of "obvious disappointment."

The most prominent of the current divisions is the increasingly deteriorating relationship between Britain and West Germany. In a special dispatch published in the "Daily Mail," Kenneth Ames said that at the Western foreign ministers' meeting, "The Germans took the lead in trying to undermine British plans. It has become very clear in the past few weeks that the West German Chancellor has been organizing a movement to compete with Macmillan. His movement appears to have achieved considerable success at the foreign ministers' meeting. The four foreign ministers have still not reached a mutually acceptable plan for dealing with the Russians, as they have in the past.”

The struggle between Britain and West Germany for hegemony in Europe constitutes part of the conflict between Washington and London. Kenneth Ames continued: "Adenauer considers himself Washington's closest and most reliable ally. Diplomatic observers in Bonn say he is dissatisfied with the prestige Macmillan has recently gained as the only most imaginative Western politician. Prime Minister Macmillan's trip to Moscow was strongly resented by both General de Gaulle and Chancellor Adenauer.

"A new Bonn-Paris axis has been established. The purpose of this axis is to increase influence over Washington without Dulles and to reduce the role of Britain."

According to Bonn, Adenauer has written a private letter full of anger to Macmillan. This news signifies a further deterioration in the relations between the two countries. A "Times" reporter said that Adenauer "now deeply suspects again that Britain is trying to make Germany (West Germany) suffer."

    大西洋集团裂缝越补越大
    最近一系列会议未能解决内部分歧
    英国和西德争夺西欧霸权斗争激烈
    新华社伦敦4日电　北大西洋集团国家进行的一系列会商，仍然解决不了它们之间的分歧。
    麦克米伦最近在波恩、巴黎和华盛顿所举行的一系列的商谈的结果是：西方国家之间的所谓“团结”发生了更明显的破裂。英国、法国、美国和西德四国的外长本周在华盛顿举行的会谈，也没有能解决他们在对待德国、欧洲和东西方关系等问题上态度的不同。
    他们一直在讨论的上述问题中，有很大一部分将不能不重新交给“工作小组”。在外长们再次举行会议以前，这个为了协调西方的意见和准备同苏联的谈判而建立的小组，将重新在伦敦工作。
    保守党报纸“每日邮报”今天说，西方四国外长一直是在“明显的失望的气氛”中进行商谈的。
    目前分歧中最突出的是英国和西德的关系日益恶化。肯尼斯·艾姆斯在“每日邮报”刊载的一篇特讯中说，在西方的外长会议上，“德国人领头企图破坏英国的计划。在过去几星期中事情已经变得很清楚，西德总理一直在组织一个同麦克米伦竞争的运动。他这一运动在外长会议上看来已经获得了相当的成功。四国外长仍然和过去一样没有达成一个彼此都能接受的对付俄国人的计划。”
    英国和西德争夺欧洲霸权的斗争，构成了华盛顿和伦敦之间的冲突的一部分。肯尼斯·艾姆斯接着说：“阿登纳认为他自己是华盛顿最亲密的和最可靠的盟友。波恩的外交观察家们说，他不满意麦克米伦新近获得的作为西方政治家中唯一最有创见的人的那种威望。麦克米伦首相的莫斯科之行，遭到了戴高乐将军和阿登纳总理两人的强烈不满。
      “一个新的波恩—巴黎轴心已经建立起来了。这个轴心的目的，是对没有杜勒斯的华盛顿增加影响，并且减低英国的作用。”
    据波恩透露，阿登纳已经写了一封充满愤怒的私人信给麦克米伦。这个消息意味着这两国关系的进一步恶化。“泰晤士报”记者说，阿登纳“现在又深深地怀疑英国企图使德国（西德）吃苦头了。”
