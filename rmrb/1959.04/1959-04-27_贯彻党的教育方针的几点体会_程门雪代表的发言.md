Several Experiences in Implementing the Party's Education Policy
Speech by Delegate Cheng Menxue

Chairman, esteemed delegates:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report."

Today, I would like to share with the assembly my profound understanding of the correctness of the Party's education policy of combining education with productive labor and the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), based on my work at the Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine for the past two years.

Achievements in Several Major Areas of Work
Teaching Construction

The Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine was built from scratch. In the past, its teaching suffered from separation of education from politics, theory from practice, and a focus on mere textual interpretation, with insufficient inheritance of valuable experience from predecessors. At the same time, teachers harbored sectarian biases, preventing them from learning from each other's strengths and compensating for weaknesses, hindering academic discussions, preventing the flourishing of diverse viewpoints, and obstructing collective lesson preparation. Teaching methods were also inconsistent, and the teaching plan was unrealistic, with students spending about forty hours per week in class, creating an excessive burden.

These problems were fully exposed during the rectification campaign. Under the leadership of the Party, we set up "onsite rooms," where we presented the teaching plan, syllabus, textbooks, various rules and regulations in teaching, and the planning of teaching and research groups to the masses for review, open discussions, and debates, conducting criticism and self-criticism. More than thirty special debates and over two hundred group discussions were held, which improved the ideological understanding of most teachers, recognizing that TCM teaching must adhere to the Party's education policy and implement the Party's TCM policy. Based on this new ideological foundation, teachers and students put forward more than six thousand suggestions, laying the foundation for teaching construction.

Through extensive airing of views, big debates, and big discussions, a new situation emerged in the teaching departments and teaching work. First, teachers affirmed that the Party could lead TCM teaching work and could successfully run the TCM college. Second, a more realistic and complete teaching plan was drafted, with a reasonable arrangement of teaching hours for each course. Class time was reduced from forty hours to thirty hours per week, ensuring that students had six hours per week to participate in productive labor activities. Third, the spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, breaking superstitions, and boldly creating and innovating was promoted. Sectarian biases were broken down, and the compilation of teaching outlines and textbooks was carried out. In a relatively short period, collective strength was brought into play, and eight teaching outlines and parts of textbooks, including medical history, materia medica, formulas, typhoid fever, epidemic diseases, surgery, diagnostics, and internal medicine, were compiled. Fourth, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" began to be followed, with collective lesson preparation, mutual observation, and exchange of experiences. Fifth, according to the principle of linking theory with practice, the combination of teaching and clinical work, and the combination of education and productive labor were implemented.

Combining Education with Productive Labor

In implementing the combination of education with productive labor, our college began to carry out work-study activities in April 1958, linking up with six factories and three agricultural cooperatives. Teachers and students participated in industrial and agricultural productive labor in batches for training, initially cultivating a labor perspective and establishing contact with the working people. After the issuance of the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on education work, all teachers and students enthusiastically participated in learning. Everyone believed that it was necessary to ensure that students were both workers and peasants, and that the determination of labor targets and the arrangement of labor time should be determined according to needs, and that one side should not be emphasized, emphasizing any one side is one-sided.

Politics is the commander and the soul. When ideological understanding is consistent, there is sufficient motivation. Therefore, during the industrial drought resistance movement, more than two hundred people collected 60,902 jin of scrap steel in five days. On the eve of National Day, when all the teachers and students of the college heard that the task of transporting steel raw materials at the Shanghai Railway South Station was unprecedentedly tight, more than two hundred people immediately set off to support, working hard for four days with soaring enthusiasm, transporting 22,920 tons of steel raw materials, exceeding the quota set by the railway, and were praised by the Party committee of the station. In order to support the agricultural bumper harvest, the great leap in production, urban-rural cooperation to carry out cultural revolution and technical revolution, labor training and self-education, all the teachers and students of the college participated in half a month of voluntary labor in Qinfeng Commune, Shanghai County, in late October last year. Many advanced examples emerged in the labor process, such as in the high tide of manure accumulation, each person accumulated 46.91 dan of manure per day, and students in the 62nd grade accumulated an average of 1,834 dan of manure per day, more than ten times the daily accumulation of ordinary commune members, creating the highest record of daily manure accumulation in Shanghai County.

In order to implement the teaching policy of linking theory with practice, all teachers and students of the college opened an outpatient department. Students learn and practice at the same time, and teachers teach and practice clinically at the same time, thereby improving the quality of teaching. Tuina (therapeutic massage) is one of the precious heritages of traditional Chinese medicine. In 1956, our college established the only Tuina medical school in the country, implementing a work-study system, attending classes on one hand and providing outpatient services on the other, which not only improved the quality of teaching but also solved most of the school's funding problems. In order to meet the needs of teaching, a nursery was set up on the campus with the cooperation of teachers and students, planting more than 200 kinds of medicinal materials. A medical model factory was established to manufacture acupuncture models and tongue coating models, accepting orders from all over the country. Our pharmaceutical factory can also produce a large number of Moutan Cortex compound preparations for the treatment of hypertension and a variety of other drugs for the treatment of other diseases. Other teaching needs, such as bone models, visceral models, and drug wall charts, are also made by teachers and students themselves. Now, according to the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC on conscientiously implementing the system of cadres participating in physical labor, we further organize all teachers and students of the college to participate in various labor activities in a planned and guided manner, improve the teachers and students' consciousness and enthusiasm in participating in labor, and established a production section to specifically arrange the various tasks of teachers and students participating in physical labor. The above series of measures shows that our college is resolutely following the policy of combining education with productive labor and education serving proletarian politics.

Mobilizing the Masses to Conduct Scientific Research on a Large Scale

In the early days of the school, due to the full focus on daily work, there was no time to take care of scientific research, so less scientific research work was carried out. Last June, after the central government put forward the call to break superstitions, emancipate the mind, and carry out technological revolution, a mass upsurge in the study of traditional Chinese medicine appeared in our college. On the eve of "July 1st," we held a college-wide scientific leap forward contribution conference. At the meeting, the Party committee called for the great cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine to jointly march toward traditional Chinese medicine. In early August, at the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Research Work Leap Forward Conference, our college proposed two "satellites," ten dedications, and thirty research topics. In order to strengthen the leadership of scientific research, a scientific research office was established to help various departments solve problems in scientific research. Due to the strengthening of leadership and the large-scale mass movement of scientific research, scientific research work has been further vigorously developed. When offering gifts to the Party on National Day, 71 research topics were completed, and later all teachers, students, and staff completed another 144 research topics to offer gifts to New Year's Day in 1959. At the same time, the scientific research work in 1959 will be further widely and deeply carried out, and the annual research topics have reached 203.

Among the above-mentioned topics, many belong to cutting-edge science. For example, deafness and muteness have not yet been resolved in the current world medicine. However, under the leadership of the Party, the Eleventh People's Hospital affiliated to our college achieved an effective rate of 92.1% in the treatment of deafness and muteness with acupuncture. Many deaf people have recovered their hearing, and mutes have opened their mouths to say that socialism is good. There are many ways of treating hypertension with traditional Chinese medicine. In order to conquer hypertension, we tried every means to find a way, and we have achieved significant results so far; using the method of syndrome differentiation and treatment, the curative effect reached 85.7%; the curative effect of Erxian Decoction in the treatment of menopausal hypertension in women reached 86.49%; and the curative effect of the Moutan Cortex, Gastrodia, and Uncaria compound mixture proposed by the Western medicine study class in Chinese medicine reached 87.3%. It now seems that the conquest of hypertension by traditional Chinese medicine is not far away.

Through the leadership of the Party, the mass line, and the three-way combination of old Tuina doctors, the Tuina medical school achieved a soaring enthusiasm, and in just 25 days, successfully compiled a relatively complete "Tuina Science" that has never existed before.

Going Out to Run Schools to Eliminate Pests and Diseases

Going out to run schools and combining it with pest and disease elimination to carry out onsite teaching work is a major link in implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor and education serving proletarian politics. To this end, at the call of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, more than 600 teachers, students, medical staff of our college went to Qinfeng Commune, Shanghai County on November 19 last year to carry out onsite teaching. Thanks to the strong support of Party and government organizations at all levels of the commune and the selfless work of all comrades, great results were achieved after less than a month of fighting. Combining manure accumulation, digging and shoveling mosquito and fly breeding grounds, filling and transforming 428 live water ponds, totaling 417,190 square meters, cleaning 66 cattle, sheep and pig sheds, 12,040 dan of livestock manure, 9,380 dan of garbage, 195,340 dan of accumulated fertilizer, 5,579 rats, 3,340 square meters of snail extermination, 6,403 people were treated for diseases, and 20,549 stool samples were collected. In particular, under the leadership of the Party, the first brigade snatched a laboring peasant woman, Lu Yuemei, a critically ill patient, from the hands of the god of death. In order to rescue Lu Yuemei, the Party promptly formed a rescue team consisting of TCM teachers, students of TCM research classes, and undergraduate students to carry out day and night tenacious battles. In the countryside with relatively poor conditions, the dying patient was rescued, which greatly moved the commune members, so they said: "The stars in the sky are bright, the good things in the world are countless, Chairman Mao sent 'immortals' to rescue the dying Yuemei."

Several Experiences

1. The leadership of the Party and putting politics in command are important guarantees for the achievements made in the past two years: In the past two years, through the rectification, anti-rightist, and criticism of bourgeois individualism and other movements, the political awareness of all teachers, students, and staff has been improved, which has greatly promoted the great leap forward in various tasks. It fully demonstrates the correctness and wisdom of the Party's leadership. Without the Party's leadership and putting politics in command, these achievements would not have been possible.
2. It is necessary to resolutely implement the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor and the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine: Because we take the Party's policies and guidelines as our guide to action, follow the Party's policies and guidelines, carry out the great revolution in education, great unity between Chinese and Western medicine, and conduct scientific research on a large scale, we have been able to achieve these achievements in a relatively short period of time in education revolution, scientific research, and pest and disease elimination.
3. It is necessary to follow the mass line and carry out mass movements on a large scale: In the past, I also had a certain degree of superstition about the idea of experts, and I thought that to run a TCM college well, it was necessary to concentrate TCM experts to ensure it. However, the facts in the past year or two have proved that whether it is to carry out the education revolution or scientific research, it is necessary to follow the mass line and carry out mass movements on a large scale, and it is not possible to rely solely on a few people. It is necessary to follow the mass line under the leadership of the Party and give play to the role of experts, so that various tasks can be carried out in a faster, better, and more economical way.

The Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine is the highest institution of traditional Chinese medicine. Inheriting, collating, and promoting the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine is an arduous task, but we believe that under the correct leadership of the Party and with the united efforts of Chinese and Western teachers, we will be able to overcome difficulties, create experience, and cultivate new TCM talents, and make great contributions to the research, collation, and promotion of the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine and enrich China's new medicine.

    贯彻党的教育方针的几点体会
    程门雪代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的“政府工作报告”。
    今天向大会谈谈二年多来在上海中医学院工作中，深切体会到党的教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针、党的中医政策的正确性。
    几项主要工作的成绩  教学建设
    上海中医学院从无到有，过去在教学上存在教学脱离政治，理论脱离实际，专在文字上兜圈子，对于前人宝贵的经验，却继承得不够。同时教师中存在门户之见，不能取长补短，互相学习，因此在学术讨论中，不能百家争鸣，集体备课搞不起来，教学方法各搞一套。教学计划不切实际，每周上课时数在四十学时左右，学生负担过重。
    这些情况在整风运动中，被充分地揭发出来。在党的领导下，布置了现场室，把教学计划、大纲、教材、教学中的各种规章制度、教研组的规划等，都拿出来与群众见面，就地鸣放、就地辩论，开展批评与自我批评。先后举行专题辩论三十余次，小组讨论二百余次，使大部分教师在思想上有所提高，认识到中医教学必须坚持党的教育方针和贯彻党的中医政策。在这样新的思想基础上，师生提出了六千多条建议，为教学建设奠定了基础。
    经过大鸣大放、大争大辩，教学部门和教学工作，出现了新的局面。首先教师肯定了党能够领导中医教学工作，能够领导办好中医学院。其次，拟订出了一套比较切合实际的、完整的教学计划，合理安排了各门课程的教学时数。上课时间每周由四十学时减到三十学时，保证学生每周有六小时参加生产劳动的活动。第三，提倡敢想敢说敢做，发扬破除迷信，大胆创造，大胆革新的精神，打破门户之见，进行了教学大纲和教材的编写工作，在较短时间内，发挥集体力量，编写出医学史、本草、方剂、伤寒、瘟病、外科、诊断、内科杂病等八种教学大纲和部分教材。第四，开始遵循百家争鸣的方针，进行集体备课，相互观摩，交流经验。第五，根据理论联系实际的方针，实行了教学与临床工作相结合、教育与生产劳动相结合。
    教育与生产劳动相结合
    在贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合方面，我院自一九五八年四月份起即开展勤工俭学的活动，先后与六个工厂、三个农业社挂了钩，师生分批参加了工农业生产劳动进行锻炼，在劳动中初步培养了劳动观点，建立了和劳动人民的联系。中共中央、国务院关于教育工作的指示下达后，全体师生热烈参加学习。大家都认为必须要做到是学生是工人又是农民，劳动对象的确定和劳动时间的安排，应视需要而定，不能强调一面，强调任何一面都是片面的。
    政治是统帅是灵魂，思想认识一致了，干劲就足了。因此，在工业抗旱运动中，二百多人在五天内收集废钢铁计六万零九百零二斤。国庆前夕，全院师生听到上海铁路南站钢铁原料运输任务空前紧张，二百多人立即出发支援，以冲天干劲，苦战四天，运输钢铁原料二万二千九百二十吨，超额完成铁路规定的指标，受到该站党委的表扬。为了支援农业大丰收、生产大跃进、城乡协作进行文化革命和技术革命，劳动锻炼和自我教育，全院师生在去年十月下旬到上海县勤丰公社参加了半个月的义务劳动。在劳动中出现了许多先进事例，如在积肥高潮中，每人每日积肥四十六点九一担，六二年级学生每日平均积肥竟达一千八百三十四担，超过一般社员每日积肥十倍以上，创造了上海县每日积肥的最高纪录。
    为了贯彻理论联系实际的教学方针，全院师生开设了门诊部。学生边学习边实习，教师半教学半临床，从而提高了教学质量。推拿是祖国医学的宝贵遗产之一，一九五六年我院附设了全国唯一的推拿医士学校，实行半工半读，一面上课，一面门诊，不仅提高了教学质量而且也解决了学校的大部分经费。为了配合教学上的需要，在师生协作下，利用校内空地自辟了苗圃，种药二百多种。创办了医学模型工厂，制造针灸模型、舌苔模型，接受各地订货任务。我们的制药厂，还能大批生产治疗高血压的丹皮合剂以及治疗其他疾病等的多种药品，其他教学上的需要，如骨胳模型、脏腑模型、药物挂图，也都由师生亲手制造。现在，我们根据中共上海市委关于认真执行干部参加体力劳动的制度的指示，进一步组织全院师生有计划有领导地参加各项劳动，提高师生参加劳动的自觉性和积极性，并且成立了生产科，具体安排有关师生参加体力劳动的各项工作。上述这一系列的措施，说明我院正坚决遵循着教育与生产劳动相结合、教育为无产阶级政治服务的方针前进。
    发动群众大搞科学研究
    建校初期，因全力应付日常工作，无暇顾及科学研究，因此对科学研究工作开展得较少。去年六月，中央提出了破除迷信，解放思想，进行技术革命号召以后，我院出现了群众性的研究祖国医学的高潮，在“七一”前夕，我们举行了全院科学跃进献宝大会。会上党委号召中西医大协作，共同向祖国医学进军。八月上旬，在上海市科学技术研究工作跃进大会上，我院提出二个“卫星”，十个献礼，三十个研究题目。为了加强科学研究的领导，成立了科学研究办公室，帮助各部门解决在科学研究中的问题。由于加强领导，大搞科学研究群众运动，因此科学研究工作进一步得到蓬勃开展，在国庆节向党献礼时，完成七十一项研究题目，以后全体师生员工又完成一百四十四项研究题目，向一九五九年元旦献礼。同时一九五九年的科学研究工作将进一步地广泛深入开展起来，全年的研究题目已达二百零三项。
  在上述这些题目中，有很多是属于尖端科学。如聋哑在目前世界医学上尚未解决。但是在党的领导下，我院附属十一人民医院用针刺治疗聋哑的有效率达到百分之九十二点一，很多聋子恢复了听觉，哑吧开口说社会主义好。中医中药治疗高血压的方法是多种多样的，为了征服高血压，我们千方百计想办法，目前已获得显著成绩；用辨证论治的方法，疗效达到百分之八十五点七；二仙汤治疗妇女更年期的高血压，疗效达到百分之八十六点四九；西医学习中医研究班提出的丹皮、天麻、钩藤合剂疗效达到百分之八十七点三。现在看来，中医中药征服高血压，已为期不远了。
    推拿医士学校，通过党的领导，群众路线和推拿老医生三结合，全体同学发挥了冲天干劲，在短短二十五天就胜利出色地编写成一部内容比较完备的从来没有的“推拿学”。
    出门办学除害灭病
    出门办学，结合除害灭病进行现场教学工作，是贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合、教育为无产阶级政治服务的方针的主要环节。为此，在中共上海市委的号召下，我院六百余名师生医护人员于去年十一月十九日赴上海县勤丰公社进行现场教学，由于公社各级党政组织的大力支持，全体同志忘我工作，经过不到一个月的战斗，取得了很大成绩。结合积肥挖铲蚊蝇孳生地，填平改造活水塘四百二十八个，共四十一万七千一百九十平方公尺，清除牛羊猪棚六十六个，畜粪一万二千零四十担，垃圾九千三百八十担，积肥一十九万五千三百四十担，老鼠五千五百七十九只，灭螺三千三百四十平方公尺，治病六千四百零三人次，普查大便二万零五百四十九人次。特别是第一大队在党的领导下，把一位劳动农妇——垂危病人陆悦梅从死神手里夺了回来，为了抢救陆悦梅，党及时组成由中医老师、中医研究班学员、本科同学参加的抢救小组，进行日夜顽强的战斗，在各项条件比较差的农村里，把奄奄一息的病人救活，给公社的社员们以很大感动，所以他们说：“天上的星儿亮晶晶，人间的好事数不清，毛主席派了‘仙人’来，垂死的悦梅也回生。”
    几点体会
    1、党的领导、政治挂帅是二年来取得成绩的重要保证：二年来通过整风、反右以及批判资产阶级个人主义等各项运动，全体师生员工政治觉悟提高，大大推动各项工作的大跃进。充分显示出党的领导的正确英明，如果没有党的领导和政治挂帅，这些成绩是不可能获得的。
    2、必须坚决贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针和党的中医政策：由于我们把党的政策方针作为我们行动的指南，遵照党的政策方针办事，进行教育大革命、中西大团结、大搞科学研究，因此才能在较短时期内，在教育革命、科学研究和除害灭病等工作上，取得这些成绩。
    3、必须走群众路线，大搞群众运动：过去在我思想上也存在一定程度迷信专家思想，认为要搞好中医学院必须把中医专家集中起来，才有保证。但是一二年来的事实证明搞教育革命也好，搞科学研究也好，必须走群众路线，大搞群众运动，单纯依靠少数人是不行的。必须在党的领导下，走群众路线，并且发挥专家的作用，这样才能把各项工作多快好省地开展起来。
    上海中医学院，是中医最高学府，继承整理发扬祖国医学遗产是一项艰巨的任务，但是我们相信，在党的正确领导下，在中西教师的团结努力下，一定能够克服困难，创造经验，培养出新的中医人材，为研究整理发扬祖国医药学遗产，充实我国的新医学，作出伟大的贡献。
