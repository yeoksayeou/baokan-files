Chairman, fellow committee members:

After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government and the reports of other leaders, I am very excited and express my heartfelt support. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our motherland has been changing rapidly. Its international status has been rising, and its international reputation has been growing day by day. Various construction undertakings within the country have been developing rapidly. All of this is the best teaching material for me to transform my thinking. The great rectification campaign and the all-round and nationwide Great Leap Forward in 1958 have made me realize the bright prospects and great future of the new China, thereby generating infinite confidence and hope, and making me feel proud to be a citizen of the new China.

I also support the government's handling of the Tibetan issue. I feel particularly indignant at the absurd behavior of the Tibetan rebels. My level is low and my analytical ability is not high, but I always have the feeling that the stronger we are, the more tricks the imperialists and their lackeys will have to obstruct us. We certainly hate these lackeys, but we should recognize those who mastermind them behind the scenes. Historically, and from the development of the Tibetan incident, can it be said that the Tibetan incident has nothing to do with the old British imperialism? Or with Indian expansionists? I sincerely hope they will quickly clarify their identities with subsequent actions. The Chinese people have enough strength to smash all conspiracies.

Production capacity and technical strength have greatly increased since liberation.

Now I would like to talk about China's sugar industry:

I am an engineering technician who has been engaged in the technical work of the sugar industry in old China and after liberation. Looking back on the past, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, although our country possessed favorable natural conditions for the development of the sugar industry, the sugar industry suffered an unfortunate fate. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries, as well as those bureaucratic warlords and comprador classes, would rather spend a lot of foreign exchange to import "foreign sugar" from abroad than do anything beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the production level of my country's sugar industry was very low until the eve of liberation. At the time of liberation, there were only dozens of engineering technicians and two or three sugar factories that could barely start production. In fact, my country's sugar industry only began to develop after liberation.

Nearly ten years have passed since the founding of New China. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, my country's sugar industry has been greatly improved and developed in terms of construction scale, construction speed, and newly added production capacity. From 1953 to 1957, the newly added production capacity of sugar in my country increased by 620,000 tons, while the newly added production capacity in 1958 increased by 600,000 tons. During the first five-year plan period, there were 18 large-scale construction projects above the quota in the sugar industry, while the number of construction projects above the quota in 1958 and 1959 will greatly exceed this number, showing that my country's sugar industry is developing vigorously with each passing day. In terms of the growth of technical strength in the sugar industry, thanks to the attention and care of the Party and the People's Government, there has also been great development. In addition to the establishment of professional administrative management, surveying and design, construction and installation, equipment manufacturing, and scientific research departments in various sugar-producing areas, universities and colleges also have sugar industry specialties and departments, educating and training a large number of technical talents in the sugar industry. Now, the technical strength of my country's sugar industry is not just the dozens of people at the time of liberation, but thousands of people. This increase is not only in the quantity of technical strength, but also in the improvement of technical level. In the early days of liberation, although we encountered some difficulties in sugar technology, they were all overcome under the leadership of the Party. At the same time, after the actual exercise during the first five-year plan period, the situation has changed, and technical problems have been basically resolved. In production, the conservative quotas commonly used in capitalist countries in the past were broken, and through technological revolution, the production capacity quota of the original enterprises was increased by 40% to 60% compared with the quotas of capitalist countries. Due to the adoption of measures for varieties that mature at different times in raw material cultivation, the production period has been extended. In the past, a sugar factory with a daily processing capacity of 1,000 tons of raw materials produced at most about 10,000 tons of sugar per year, but now it has been increased to more than 20,000 tons. In terms of design technology, modern large-scale sugar factories used to need to ask foreign countries for design, but now they can design themselves, saving more than half of the investment compared with foreign designs. The design time is shortened by about three times. And began to provide technical assistance to foreign countries. In terms of technical equipment, the manufacturing capacity of sugar machines has developed from scratch, from small to large. By last year, the annual output of sugar-making equipment had reached 15,000 tons, and it is expected that there will be a great development in the future. These achievements should be attributed to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and to the superior socialist system.

Regarding the existing problems in the sugar industry, I would like to offer four suggestions.

The construction task of the sugar industry in the future is very arduous. Therefore, I would like to put forward the following suggestions regarding the existing problems in the sugar industry:

1. The problem of coordination between industry and agriculture. The development of the sugar industry depends on the supply of agricultural raw materials. Therefore, industrial and agricultural departments should make unified arrangements based on the overall interests of the country. In the past few years, with the increase in sugar consumption, the planting area of ​​sugar crops has also expanded. However, despite this, some sugar factories in some provinces still have insufficient raw materials, factories are not full, and equipment capacity cannot be fully utilized. There are two reasons for this: first, the output of sugar materials cannot meet the needs of industrial production; second, the sugar materials are too scattered, and the raw materials cannot be supplied according to production needs. Another situation is that the construction work cannot keep up, sugar materials are planted, but the newly built sugar factories cannot be put into production on schedule, causing passivity in agriculture. Whether it is the former or the latter, I think the fundamental problem is the coordination between industry and agriculture. If industry and agriculture are well coordinated, this imbalance can be properly resolved. At present, the equipment potential of the sugar industry has not been fully utilized. With the development of the technological revolution in the sugar industry, agricultural production must be adapted to it. Therefore, the overall planning of industry and agriculture has become the most important and urgent task of the sugar industry. Secondly, the industrial and agricultural sides have not reached a consensus on the varieties of sugar crops. The industrial side believes that varieties with higher sugar content should be used, requiring more sugar to be produced under the condition of equal raw material volume; while the agricultural side believes that high-yielding varieties should be used to increase per-mu yield and agricultural income. In fact, this contradiction can be unified if it is reasonably adjusted. Therefore, I believe that the industrial and agricultural departments in relevant sugar-producing areas need to make reasonable arrangements for the varieties of sugar materials in order to achieve the goal of producing more sugar for the country and making farmers profitable.

2. The ratio of white sugar to brown sugar should be appropriately adjusted, which is one of the effective measures to increase sugar production. Generally speaking, the processing process of white sugar is more complicated than that of brown sugar, and the yield rate of white sugar is lower. In terms of small and medium-sized sugar factories, sugar factories that process the same amount of raw materials have a 20% higher sugar yield rate for producing brown sugar than for producing white sugar. However, in the past, when building many small sugar factories, there was an excessive emphasis on the production of white sugar. This is unrealistic. In the past, large-scale mechanized sugar factories also excessively emphasized that white sugar must be produced. If such regulations are not made and the proportion of brown sugar is allowed to be increased, not only can the sugar output be increased, but also the process can be simplified, the processing capacity can be increased, and the relative amount of sugar will increase in quantity. Moreover, brown sugar has always been one of the favorite foods of the nation in our country. Of course, there are still many difficulties in the storage of brown sugar, but as long as close cooperation is achieved with the commercial departments, sugar is not difficult to store, but there is no long-term storage problem at all. Product varieties should be diversified, they must be diversified, and it is not objective or realistic to excessively emphasize the production of white sugar. Therefore, I don't think that producing a little more brown sugar can be understood as going backwards, but rather as being pragmatic and starting from objective reality.

3. The People's Commune is a new organizational form. In the past, there was a complete management system in sugar production. Therefore, it is necessary for various sugar-producing areas to establish contact with the People's Commune, sign long-term raw material supply contracts, and ensure the completion of the sugar factory's production tasks. The sugar factory's production is closely related to the People's Commune's production of sugar materials, which is a mutually conditional and interdependent relationship. To ensure the supply of raw materials for the sugar factory's production, it must obtain the cooperation and cooperation of the People's Commune; the People's Commune's production of sugar materials must also be closely coordinated with the sugar factory in order to be processed in a timely manner. Therefore, establishing a long-term contractual relationship has become one of the important links conducive to industrial and agricultural production. Since the change of the system, large-scale sugar factories that were previously managed by the central government have been decentralized to provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and some provinces have decentralized the enterprises decentralized by the central government to special areas or counties. In general, this kind of layer-by-layer decentralization, giving full play to the enthusiasm of all parties, is correct. However, in some individual areas, due to lack of management experience, after the enterprises were decentralized to their special areas or counties, there was a phenomenon of dispersing the original manpower and material resources of the sugar factories, which affected the failure to complete the sugar factory's production tasks. It is hoped that this situation will be considered for solution.

4. The ranks of the sugar industry should be continuously consolidated, developed, and strengthened. In the past few years, party and government leading organs at all levels in various places have successively developed and expanded the technical team of the sugar industry, including scientific research departments, design departments, equipment manufacturing, construction and installation departments, etc. of the sugar industry. This has played a great role in the development of the sugar industry and the improvement of technical level. However, since last year, the nature of some technical departments in the sugar industry has changed. Some design institutions and installation departments used to undertake nationwide design and installation tasks, but now they focus on local tasks, and their enthusiasm for nationwide tasks is less than before; some equipment manufacturing departments have fundamentally changed their production tasks. I believe that it is proper and necessary to ensure local tasks, but the technical departments that used to undertake nationwide tasks and specialize in serving the sugar industry have a certain foundation and work experience, and it would be more beneficial for them to continue to serve as the front line of the sugar industry. Therefore, I suggest that the various technical departments that used to serve the national sugar industry, can it be considered to return to the team?

The above opinions are not necessarily correct, for the reference of comrades.

Finally, let me wish the conference a success and wish all members good health.

专栏：

    更好地发展制糖工业
    黄振勋委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    听了周恩来总理关于政府工作报告和其他各位首长的报告以后，我非常兴奋，表示衷心拥护。自中华人民共和国成立以来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们的祖国真是一日千里，气象万千。国际地位日益提高，国际声誉一天天扩大；国内的各项建设事业突飞猛进的向前发展。这一切，对我来说，实是改造思想的最好教材。伟大的整风运动和一九五八年的全面地全民大跃进，更使我认识到新中国的光明远景和伟大前程，从而产生了无限的信心和希望，感到作一个新中国的公民而骄傲。
    我还拥护政府对于西藏事件的处理。我对西藏叛乱分子的荒谬行为，特别感觉无比的愤慨。我的水平很低，分析能力不高，但我总有这样感觉，认为我们越强大，帝国主义者和它的走狗们，越是有多种花样来阻挠我们。我们固然恨这批走狗们，但更应认清那些在幕后主谋的人。从历史来看，也从西藏事件发展过程来看，岂可以说：西藏事件和老牌的英帝国主义无关？和印度扩张主义者无关？我很希望他们迅速的以此后行动来明确他们的身份。我们中国人民有足够力量粉碎一切阴谋。
    生产能力、技术力量，解放后都有极大增长下面谈一下中国的制糖工业：
    我是一个工程技术人员，在旧中国和解放后，一直从事于制糖工业的技术工作。回顾过去，在国民党反动派的统治时期，我国虽具备了发展制糖工业的有利的自然条件，但是，制糖工业一直遭受着不幸的命运。当时，国民党反动派以及那些官僚军阀和买办阶级，宁愿每年以大量外汇从国外进口“洋糖”，却不肯做一点有利于国计民生的事业。因此，我国的制糖工业，直到解放前夕，生产水平十分低下。解放时，只不过有几十名工程技术人员和二、三个勉强可以开工生产的糖厂。实际上我国的制糖工业，从解放后才开始得到发展。
    新中国成立接近十年了，我国的制糖工业在党和人民政府的领导下，无论在制糖工业的建设规模、建设速度以及新增生产能力方面，都得到极大提高和发展。一九五三年到一九五七年的五年中，我国食糖的新增生产能力增加了六十二万吨，而一九五八年的新增生产能力就增长六十万吨。在第一个五年计划期间，制糖工业限额以上的大型建设项目为十八个，而一九五八年和一九五九年限额以上建设项目，要大大超过这个数字，显示出我国的制糖工业正在日新月异，蓬勃的发展。在制糖工业的技术力量增长方面，由于党和人民政府的重视与关怀，也有很大发展，各个产糖区域，除建立了专业的行政管理、勘察设计、施工安装、设备制造以及科学研究部门外，在大、专学校中还设有制糖工业的专业科、系，教育和培养了大批制糖工业的技术人材。现在，我国制糖工业的技术力量，不是解放当时的几十名，而是成千上万名。不仅在技术力量的数量上有了增加，而且还表现在技术水平的提高上，解放初期，在制糖技术上虽曾碰到一些困难，但在党的领导下都一一克服了。与此同时，经过第一个五年计划期间的实际锻炼，情况有所改观，技术问题基本上得到解决。在生产上，打破了过去常用的资本主义国家的保守定额，通过技术革命，使原有企业的生产能力定额，比资本主义国家的定额，提高百分之四十到百分之六十。由于在原料培育上采取不同时期成熟品种的措施，延长了生产期。过去一座日处理原料一千吨的糖厂，年产糖最高不过一万吨左右，而现在提高到二万吨以上。在设计技术上，现代化的大型糖厂过去需请国外设计，而现在可以自己设计，投资较国外设计节省一半以上。设计时间大约缩短三倍左右。并开始对国外进行了技术援助。在技术装备上，糖机的制造能力，已经从无到有，从小到大了。到去年为止，制糖设备的年产量已达到一点五万吨，可望今后还将有很大的发展。这些成就的取得，应该归功于党和毛主席的领导，归功于优越的社会主义制度。
    就目前制糖工业存在的问题，提出四点建议
    今后制糖工业的建设任务是十分繁重的。因此，我就目前制糖工业存在的问题，提出如下几点建议：
    一、工业和农业的配合问题。制糖工业的发展，取决于农业原料的供应。因此，工业部门和农业部门应从国家整体利益出发统一安排。过去几年中，随着食糖消费水平的增长，糖料作物的种植面积也扩大了。但尽管这样，还有些省份的糖厂，发生原料不足，工厂吃不饱，设备能力不能充分发挥。其原因有二：一是糖料产量满足不了工业生产需要；二是糖料过于分散，原料不能按生产需要供应。另一种情况是建设工作跟不上，糖料种植了，而新建的糖厂不能按期投入生产，造成农业上的被动。无论前者或后者，我认为根本问题是工业与农业上配合问题，如果工农业配合得好，这种失调现象是能够得到妥善解决的。当前制糖工业的设备潜力还没有充分发挥，随着制糖工业技术革命的开展，势必要求农业生产与之相适应。从而工业与农业的全面规划就成为目前制糖工业的重中之重、急中之急的一件重大工作了。其次，糖料作物的品种方面，工业与农业方面也未取得一致意见。工业方面认为应该采用含糖份较高的品种，要求在相等的原料量的条件下，多生产一些糖；而农业方面则认为应该采用丰产种以增加亩产和农业收入。其实，这个矛盾，如果合理地加以调整是可以统一起来的。因此，我认为有关产糖地区的工业部门和农业部门有必要对糖料的品种加以合理安排，以达到既要国家多产糖，农民也合算的目的。
    二、白糖与红糖的比例，应作适当调整，这是增加食糖产量的有效措施之一。一般的来说，白糖的加工过程比红糖的加工过程是较为复杂，白糖的成品率较低。以中小型糖厂而言，处理同量原料的糖厂，生产红糖比生产白糖的产糖率高百分之二十左右。但是，过去在建设许多小糖厂时，有过份强调生产白糖的情况。这是不现实的。大型的机制糖厂，过去也过多地强调必须生产白糖。如果不作这样的规定，允许增加红糖的比额，不独可以提高产糖量，而且还可以简化工艺过程，提高处理能力，相对地糖的产量就会在数量上增多。况且，红糖在我国来说，一向是民族爱好的食品之一。当然，生产红糖在保管上还有许多困难，但是，只要与商业部门取得密切协作，糖不是保管上有困难，而是根本不发生长期保管的问题。产品品种要多样化，一定要多样化，过多地强调生产白糖是不客观的，也是不现实的。因此，我认为多生产一点红糖不能理解为开倒车，而是实事求是，从客观实际出发的态度。
    三、人民公社是一个新的组织形式。过去在糖业生产方面有着一套完整的管理体系，因此，各产糖区有必要建立与人民公社的联系，订立长期的原料供应合同，保证糖厂生产任务的完成。糖厂生产与人民公社对糖料的生产是密切相关的，是一种互为条件相互依存的关系，糖厂生产要确保原料的供应，必须取得人民公社的协作与配合；人民公社对糖料的生产，要及时得到处理，也必须与糖厂密切协作。因此，建立长期的合同关系，就成为有利于工农业生产的重要环节之一。自体制改变以后，过去由中央管的大型糖厂下放到省、市、自治区，有的省又将中央下放的企业，一竿子到底下放到专区或县，总的来说这种层层下放，充分发挥各方面的积极性是正确的。但有个别地区，由于缺乏管理经验，在企业下放到本专区或本县后，有分散了原有糖厂的人力、物力的现象，以致影响了糖厂生产任务不能完成，这种情况，希望考虑解决。
    四、应保持制糖工业的队伍不断巩固、发展和壮大。几年来，各地各级党政领导机关，先后地发展与扩大了制糖工业的技术队伍，有制糖工业的科学研究部门、设计部门、设备制造、施工安装部门等等。这对制糖工业的发展和技术水平的提高起到了极大的作用。但是，自去年以来，有些制糖工业的技术部门的性质有所改变，有的设计机构和安装部门过去承担全国性设计与安装任务，而现在偏重于本地方的任务，对全国性的任务积极性比前少了一些；有的设备制造部门，从根本上改变了生产任务。我认为，保证本地方的任务是应该的、必要的，但过去承担全国性任务和专门为制糖工业服务的技术部门，有他们一定的基础和工作经验，应继续为制糖工业担任最前线工作，更为有利。因此，我建议过去为全国制糖工业服务的各个技术部门，是否可考虑归队。
    以上意见，不一定正确，供同志们参考。
    最后，让我预贺大会成功并祝各位委员身体健康。
