Debating Close Planting Specifications, Training Rice Transplanting Experts
Foshan Special District, Guangdong, Guarantees Rational Close Planting of Early Rice

(Our report) In order to successfully navigate the early rice transplanting season with rational close planting as the central focus, and strive for a bumper early rice harvest this year, various locations in Foshan Special District, Guangdong Province, are simultaneously organizing large-scale debates on "Close Planting Specifications" and training rice transplanting experts. They are combining ideological education with technical training, aiming to achieve early, dense, and high-quality transplanting work this year.

Before early rice transplanting, some cadres and masses with conservative ideas adopted a skeptical attitude towards the achievements of last year's close planting and this year's close planting requirements. Some upper-middle peasants even openly opposed close planting. How to affirm last year's close planting achievements? How to ensure that this year's close planting specifications are both proactive and reliable without being conservative? To this end, various places held mass debate meetings of cadres and the masses on close planting, summarized last year's bumper harvest experiences, and affirmed that close planting is one of the key factors for increasing production. On the basis of unifying ideological understanding, the masses studied how to combine last year's bumper harvest experiences with the actual conditions of their respective regions to formulate this year's close planting specifications and measures, so as to achieve rational close planting. When summarizing last year's bumper harvest achievements, Jibu Commune in Baoan County cited many examples of obtaining bumper harvests after implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," refuting the arguments of upper-middle peasants Chen Guanrong and Zhang Xiangyou against close planting. For example, more than three mu of land in Ma'anshan used to be planted at nine by eight inches (nine inches between rows, eight inches between plants), with an average yield of only 250 catties per mu. Last year, it was planted at five by two inches, plus sufficient fertilization and good management, the average yield reached 620 catties per mu. Poor peasant Zhang Xiujiao pointed out that the lodging of some closely planted fields last year was caused by not plowing deeply, insufficient base fertilizer, and poor management.

After refuting the arguments against close planting, many communes also studied and analyzed the reasons why some closely planted fields last year did not meet planned targets and did not produce well, and based on this, formulated this year's close planting measures. Ren Shan Commune held an on-site rice transplanting meeting and decided that the commune's rice transplanting would be divided into four specifications: experimental fields, accounting for 5% of the area, would all be planted at three by one inch, with more than 1.5 million panicles per mu; basic farmland, accounting for 60% of the area, would be planted at one by four inches, and the rest would be planted at one by five inches and two by four inches.

In order to ensure that this year's close planting specifications can be truly implemented, various places are also training a large number of rice transplanting experts while carrying out large-scale debates on "close planting," with cadres taking the lead in demonstration planting at all levels. More than 62,000 rice transplanter operators have been trained throughout the special district. Some communes also held technical training classes to conduct on-site trial transplanting. The first batch of rice transplanting experts trained by Hengli Commune in Huiyang County numbered 149 people.

### 辩论密植规格训练插秧能手  广东佛山专区保证早稻合理密植

    辩论密植规格训练插秧能手
    广东佛山专区保证早稻合理密植
    本报讯　广东省佛山专区各地为了过好以合理密植为中心的早稻插秧关，力争今年早稻大丰收，一边组织“密植规格”大辩论；一边训练插秧手，使思想教育与技术训练相结合，力求今年的插秧工作做到早、密、好。
    早造插秧前，部分有保守思想的干部和群众，对去年密植的成就和今年早稻的密植要求，采取了怀疑的态度。尤其是一些上中农，甚至还公开反对密植。怎样去肯定去年密植的成就？怎样做到今年的密植规格既积极可靠而又不保守？为此，各地都召开了干部、群众的密植辩论大会，总结去年的丰收经验，肯定了密植是增产的关键之一。在统一思想认识的基础上，让群众研究如何结合去年的丰收经验和本地区的实际情况，制定今年的密植规格和措施，做到合理密植。宝安县吉布公社在总结去年丰产成绩时，列举了不少由于贯彻了“八字宪法”后获得丰收的实例，驳倒了上中农陈观容、张祥有反对密植的论调。如马鞍山的三亩多田，过去插九乘八（行距九寸、株距八寸），平均亩产只有二百五十斤。去年插了五乘二，加上施肥足，管理好，平均亩产达到六百二十斤。贫农张秀娇指出，去年部分密植倒伏了是因为没有深翻，底肥不足，管理不周所造成的。
    许多公社在批驳了密植不好的论调之后，还研究分析了去年一些密植田没有达到计划指标和生产不好的原因，并据此制定了今年的密植措施。稔山公社召开了插秧现场会议，决定了全社插秧分四种规格：占5％面积的试验田，全部插三乘一，每亩达一百五十万穗以上；占60％面积的基本农田插一乘四，其他的插一乘五和二乘四。
    为了使今年密植规格能够真正贯彻下去，各地在开展“密植”大辩论的同时，还大量培养插秧手，干部层层带头试插示范。全专区培养的插秧机操作手就有六万二千多人。有些公社还举办了技术训练班，进行实地试插。惠阳县横沥公社第一批训练出来的插秧手有一百四十九人。　　　　　（梁彬）（附图片）
