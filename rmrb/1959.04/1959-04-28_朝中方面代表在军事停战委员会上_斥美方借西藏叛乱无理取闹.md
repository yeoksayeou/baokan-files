Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 27th: Panmunjom Dispatch: At today's meeting of the Military Armistice Commission, the chief representative of the Korean-Chinese side, Major General Zhu Changjun, sternly condemned the US side's despicable tactic of slandering China by using the Tibetan rebellion issue to avoid directly answering the demands of the Korean-Chinese side.

The 100th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission, held this morning, was convened at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side.

At the meeting, Major General Zhu Changjun condemned the US side's provocative actions in unilaterally expelling the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at various ports in South Korea, unilaterally refusing to fulfill Paragraph 13 of the Armistice Agreement, illegally transporting atomic weapons and missile weapons into South Korea, and establishing missile bases in South Korea, all of which violate the Armistice Agreement. Major General Zhu Changjun also demanded that the US side respond to the demands made by the Korean-Chinese side at the last meeting. At the last meeting, the Korean-Chinese side had demanded that the US side immediately remove the illegally imported new-type weapons such as missiles from Korea and withdraw US troops from South Korea.

Under the stern accusations of the Korean-Chinese side, the US side, being at a loss for words, avoided giving a direct answer and instead raised the issue of the Tibetan rebellion, which has nothing to do with the Military Armistice Commission, to slander and vilify China.

Major General Zhu Changjun immediately pointed out at the meeting: "At the Military Armistice Commission, which was established to consolidate the Korean armistice, you actually raised the issue of Tibet, which is the internal affair of the People's Republic of China. This further proves that you are trying to evade the issues raised at today's meeting and attempt to obstruct the work of the Military Armistice Commission. The Tibetan rebellion is entirely an internal affair of the People's Republic of China, which no foreign country, especially your side, can interfere with. At the same time, the nature of the Tibetan rebellion is completely contrary to what you painstakingly described. It was nothing more than a handful of reactionary elements of the Tibetan upper class, instigated by imperialists and foreign reactionaries, who launched it. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the unanimous support of the Tibetan people, has completely quelled the rebellion. The suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is of historical significance for eliminating the rule, exploitation, and oppression of the working people by the reactionary elements of the Tibetan upper class, and for building a democratic and socialist Tibet. The reason why you are making vicious noises is for this reason."

    朝中方面代表在军事停战委员会上
    斥美方借西藏叛乱无理取闹
    新华社平壤27日电　板门店消息：朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将今天在军事停战委员会会议上，严厉谴责美方代表为了回避正面答复朝中方面的要求而借西藏叛乱问题诬蔑中国无理取闹的恶劣手法。
    今天上午举行的军事停战委员会第一百次会议是在朝中方面建议下召开的。
    朱昌骏少将在会上谴责了美方片面驱逐驻南朝鲜各口岸的中立国视察小组，片面拒绝履行停战协定第十三款卯项，非法向南朝鲜运进原子武器和导弹武器，并在南朝鲜建立导弹基地等违反停战协定的挑衅行为。朱昌骏少将并要求美方对朝中方面在上次会议上提出的要求作答复。在上次会议上朝中方面曾要求美方立即将非法运入南朝鲜的导弹等新型武器从朝鲜运走，并把美军从南朝鲜撤走。
    美方在朝中方面的严正指责下，理屈词穷，回避作正面答复，却提出同军事停战委员会毫无关系的西藏叛乱问题来诬蔑和中伤中国。
    朱昌骏少将在会上立即指出：“在为巩固朝鲜停战而成立的军事停战委员会上，你竟然提出了属于中华人民共和国内政的西藏问题，这更加证明了你是想要回避今天会上提出的问题，并且企图阻挠军事停战委员会的工作。西藏叛乱完全是中华人民共和国的内政，这是任何外国，尤其是你方所不能加以干涉的。同时，西藏叛乱的性质同你煞费苦心所描写的完全相反，这不过是一小撮西藏上层反动分子在帝国主义者和外国反动派的唆使下发动起来的。中国人民解放军在西藏人民的一致支持下已经彻底平息了叛乱。西藏叛乱的平息，对消灭西藏上层反动分子对劳动人民的统治、剥削和压迫，对于建设民主社会主义的西藏来说，都是有历史性意义的。你所以发出恶毒的叫嚣就是为了这个原因。”
