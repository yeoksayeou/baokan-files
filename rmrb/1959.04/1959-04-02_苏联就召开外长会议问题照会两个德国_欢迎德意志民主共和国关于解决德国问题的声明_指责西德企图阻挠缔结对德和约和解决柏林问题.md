Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 1st: According to TASS, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko received the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) to Moscow, Koenig, on March 30th and gave him a note from the Soviet government to the GDR government regarding the convocation of a conference of foreign ministers and a summit meeting between the East and West.

On March 31st, Gromyko received the Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) to the Soviet Union, Nott, and gave him the Soviet government's note to the FRG government on the same issue.

In its note to the GDR government, the Soviet government stated that it noted with satisfaction that the GDR government advocated the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the elimination of the occupation regime in West Berlin without delay.

The note stated that the Soviet government expressed its satisfaction with the GDR government's support for the Soviet proposal to convene a summit meeting of heads of government to discuss the most pressing international issues. The Soviet government noted the GDR government's readiness to participate in the summit meeting and the foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German peace treaty and the issue of West Berlin.

In the note, the Soviet government informed the GDR government that the Soviet Union would participate in the Foreign Ministers' Conference scheduled to be held in Geneva on May 11th. The note stated that the Soviet government had notified the governments of the United States, Britain, and France of this matter, and had informed them that the Soviet government agreed to discuss issues related to Germany, including the German peace treaty and the Berlin issue.

The note concluded by saying that the Soviet government welcomed the GDR government's statement that it would spare no effort to contribute to the resolution of the aforementioned issues. The resolution of these issues is of great significance to the fate of the German people and to ensuring lasting peace in Europe.

In its note to the FRG government, the Soviet government stated that it had noted that, in the face of the agreement reached between the major powers on holding negotiations on ripe international issues, judging from various indications, the FRG was still attempting, at the imminent start of these negotiations, to obstruct the negotiations in advance with unnecessary disputes and unfounded accusations.

The Soviet government pointed out that the FRG government's statements in its reply note of March 26th to the Soviet government distorted the Soviet position on the German question and the Berlin question. The note went on to point out that on the eve of the meeting of representatives of the countries concerned to discuss negotiable issues, at the initiative of the Soviet Union, the Federal government insisted, disregarding the facts, that the responsibility for the emergence of these issues and their failure to be resolved to date lay with the Soviet Union. The note said that it had long been known that the FRG government often treated the facts willfully on major issues related to easing international tensions and maintaining peace, and often made unfounded statements. The Soviet government considered it necessary to once again draw the Federal government's attention to this, and sincerely hoped that it would more soberly understand the tasks put forward at the imminent convening of the conference of foreign ministers of the countries concerned, and at the same time strive to promote the success of the negotiations on its own part.

In this note, the Soviet government notified the FRG government of matters such as the fact that the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference would be held on May 11th, and that this conference would discuss German issues, including the German peace treaty and the Berlin issue.

The note stated that the Soviet government noted the Federal government's decision to send its representatives to participate in the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    苏联就召开外长会议问题照会两个德国
    欢迎德意志民主共和国关于解决德国问题的声明
    指责西德企图阻挠缔结对德和约和解决柏林问题
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯3月30日接见了德意志民主共和国驻莫斯科大使柯尼希，并交给他一份苏联政府就召开东西方外交部长会议和高级会议问题致德意志民主共和国政府的照会。
    3月31日，葛罗米柯接见德意志联邦共和国驻苏联临时代办诺特，并把苏联政府就这个问题致德意志联邦共和国政府的照会交给了他。
    苏联政府在致德意志民主共和国政府的照会中说，苏联政府满意地注意到，德意志民主共和国政府主张毫不拖延地缔结对德和约和消除西柏林的占领制度。
    照会说，苏联政府对德意志民主共和国政府支持苏联关于召开政府首脑会议来讨论最迫切的国际问题的建议的作法表示满意。苏联政府注意到德意志民主共和国政府准备参加政府首脑会议和外长会议来讨论对德和约和西柏林的问题。
    苏联政府在照会中通知德意志民主共和国政府，苏联将参加预定于5月11日在日内瓦举行的外长会议。照会说，苏联政府已经把这件事通知了美、英、法三国政府，并且通知它们，苏联政府同意讨论有关德国的问题，包括对德和约和柏林问题。
    照会最后说，苏联政府欢迎德意志民主共和国政府的声明：德意志民主共和国政府将不遗余力地在解决上述问题方面作出贡献。上述问题的解决对德国人民的命运，对保障欧洲持久和平具有重大意义。
    苏联政府在致德意志联邦共和国政府的照会中说，苏联政府注意到，在各大国就成熟了的国际问题举行谈判已达成协议的事实面前，根据种种迹象判断，德意志联邦共和国仍然企图在这次谈判即将开始的时候，事先用不必要的争论和毫无根据的指责来阻挠谈判的进行。
    苏联政府指出，德意志联邦共和国政府在它3月26日给苏联政府的复照中的说法歪曲了苏联在德国问题和柏林问题上的立场。照会接着指出，在根据苏联的倡议，各有关国家代表即将开会讨论可以协商的问题的前夕，联邦政府竟不顾事实地硬说，这些问题之所以产生，而且至今没有得到解决，其责任在于苏联。照会说，人们早就知道，德意志联邦共和国政府在有关缓和国际紧张局势和维护和平的重大问题上往往为所欲为地对待事实，并且时常发表毫无根据的声明。苏联政府认为有必要再次提请联邦政府注意，并且真诚地希望它更加清醒地理解在有关国家外长会议即将召开的时候所提出的任务，同时从自己方面努力促使谈判成功。
  苏联政府在这份照会中把东西方外长会议将于5月11日举行、这次会议将讨论包括对德和约和柏林问题在内的德国问题等事项通知德意志联邦共和国政府。
    照会说，苏联政府注意到联邦政府派遣自己代表参加外长会议的决定。
