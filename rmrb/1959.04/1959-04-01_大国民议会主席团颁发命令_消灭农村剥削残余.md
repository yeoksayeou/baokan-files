Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, March 30th: Socialist transformation of agriculture in Romania has achieved great success, and a high tide of agricultural collectivization has emerged.

Under this situation, the Presidium of the Romanian Grand National Assembly recently issued an order announcing the final elimination of the remnants of exploitation in rural areas.

The order pointed out that remnants of the old relations of production still exist in many rural areas, and there are still phenomena of rich peasants renting out part or all of their land and exploiting others in the form of wages. The order pointed out that due to the rapid development of socialist agriculture, the abolition of land rental has become an objective requirement.

The order decided that renting out land and exploiting others in agriculture in any way will be prohibited from now on, but this shall not apply to middle peasants who hire people for short periods of time to help during busy farming seasons and those who jointly operate land with others due to loss of labor. Land previously rented out by rich peasants should be handed over to collective farms and other socialist agricultural organizations for use. Corresponding monetary compensation can be obtained for the transferred land. In addition, those who exploit others can propose the area of land that they and their families can cultivate and transfer.

The order also pointed out that those who violate and undermine the above regulations must transfer the land to collective farms and other socialist agricultural organizations free of charge and be subject to legal sanctions.

The order also mentioned the significant achievements made by the Romanian Party and government in the socialist transformation of agriculture. The order pointed out that out of the 3.6 million peasant households in the country, more than 2 million households have joined collective farms and mutual aid teams and other socialist agricultural organizations. The land area of the entire socialist sector of agriculture (including state-owned farms) has reached more than 8.4 million hectares, accounting for more than 60% of the total cultivated land area. Now, a high tide of agricultural cooperation movement has emerged throughout the country. Constanta Province has fully realized cooperation, and Galati, Timisoara, and other provinces are currently rapidly moving towards full cooperation.

The order said that the state's investment in agriculture during the period of 1956-1960 amounted to 11 billion lei. In 1959, the state will supply the countryside with another 9,150 tractors, 4,700 combine harvesters, 6,200 seeders, and other agricultural machinery. By 1960, the countryside will have 58,000 tractors.

The order also pointed out that the state will increase the appropriation for farmland water conservancy projects year by year. The chemical industry will also provide the countryside with a large amount of chemical fertilizers and other products, thereby promoting increased agricultural production. The order pointed out that the state will also transfer a large number of technical cadres to the countryside.

    大国民议会主席团颁发命令
    消灭农村剥削残余
    据新华社布加勒斯特30日电　罗马尼亚农业社会主义改造已经获得巨大的成就，目前已出现农业合作化的高潮。
    在这种形势下，罗马尼亚大国民议会主席团最近颁发命令，宣布最后消灭农村中剥削现象的残余。
    命令指出，在许多农村中还存在着旧的生产关系的残余，尚存在富农出租部分或全部土地，以及以工资形式剥削他人的现象。命令指出，由于社会主义农业的迅速发展，废除土地的出租现象已成为客观的要求。
    命令决定，今后禁止出租土地和在农业中以任何方式剥削他人，但在农忙时短期雇人帮助的中农和因丧失劳动力与别人合伙经营土地者，不在此例。富农过去已出租的土地应交给集体农庄和其它社会主义农业组织使用。移交出的土地可以得到相应的货币补偿。此外，剥削他人者可以提出自己和家人可能耕种和移交的土地面积。
    命令还指出，凡违反和破坏上述规定者必须将土地无偿地移交给集体农庄和其它社会主义农业组织，并受到法律制裁。
    命令还谈到了罗马尼亚党和政府在农业社会主义改造中所取得的重大成就。命令指出，目前在全国三百六十万农户中，已经有二百万以上的农户加入集体农庄和共耕社等社会主义农业组织。整个农业的社会主义部分（包括国营农场）的土地面积已达八百四十万公顷以上，占农业总耕地面积的60％以上。现在，全国各地已出现了农业合作化运动的高潮。在康斯坦萨州已全部实现了合作化，加拉齐、底密索拉和其它州目前正很快地向全部合作化前进。
    命令说，在1956—1960年期间国家在农业方面的投资达一百一十亿列伊。1959年国家将再供给农村九千一百五十辆拖拉机、四千七百台联合收割机、六千二百台播种机和其它农业机器。到1960年农村将拥有五万八千台拖拉机。
    命令还指出，国家将逐年增加对兴修农田水利的拨款。化学工业也将向农村提供大量的化学肥料和其它产品，从而促使农业增产。命令指出，国家还将向农村输送大批技术干部。
