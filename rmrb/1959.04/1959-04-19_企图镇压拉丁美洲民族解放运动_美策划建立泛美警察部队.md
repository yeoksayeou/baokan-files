Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 17th - According to a report in today's "Hoy" newspaper in Cuba, the United States is attempting to turn the Organization of American States into a gendarme organization to suppress national liberation movements in the Caribbean and throughout Latin America. This is a new conspiracy following the U.S. meeting with ambassadors from twelve countries in the Caribbean region last weekend.

"Hoy" stated that U.S. Senator George Smathers proposed to the U.S. Senate the establishment of a police force for the Organization of American States. Smathers believes that the purpose of establishing this police force is because "since Fidel Castro came to power, a storm has threatened the Caribbean." Smathers also bluntly stated that "the development of Cuba does not meet the hopes of many of us." The newspaper pointed out that Smathers' proposal to establish a police force for the Organization of American States, controlled by the United States like the Organization of American States itself, aims to prevent the outbreak of revolutions in Latin America and attempts to protect existing dictatorships under the guise of maintaining peace and to obtain a "Pan-American" force to intervene in Cuba. "Hoy" emphasized that this conspiracy by the U.S. government should not be ignored. The imperialist attempt should be exposed, so that the people of Cuba and Latin America can be vigilant and rise up to resolutely fight against Washington's plan.

　　企图镇压拉丁美洲民族解放运动
　　美策划建立泛美警察部队
    新华社哈瓦那17日电　据古巴“今日报”今天报道，美国正企图使美洲国家组织成为一个镇压加勒比地区和全拉丁美洲民族解放运动的宪兵组织。这是上周末美国召开驻加勒比地区十二个国家使节会议后所进行的一项新的阴谋活动。
    “今日报”说，美国参议员乔治·斯马瑟斯曾向美国参议院提议成立一支美洲国家组织的警察部队。斯马瑟斯认为，成立这个警察部队的目的是因为“从菲德尔·卡斯特罗上台起，暴风雨就威胁着加勒比。”斯马瑟斯还露骨的说，“古巴的发展并不符合我们许多人的希望”。报纸指出，斯马瑟斯提议成立一支像美洲国家组织一样受美国控制的美洲国家组织的警察部队，其目的是防止拉丁美洲革命的爆发，企图在维持和平的借口下保护现有的独裁统治和获得一支干涉古巴的“泛美”部队。“今日报”强调指出，不应该忽视美国政府的这个阴谋。应该揭露帝国主义的企图，使古巴和拉丁美洲人民提高警惕，起来向华盛顿的计划作坚决的斗争。
