High Yield, Less Planting, More Harvest
Some Experiences of Shanxi Province in Reforming the Cultivation System
Guo Zhong

In the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958, Shanxi Province, like other regions across the country, extensively promoted intensive cultivation and a cultivation system of high yield, less planting, and more harvest. This revolutionary cultivation system should be promoted based on different situations and conditions in various regions. However, once this system was implemented, it told people with eloquent facts: As long as we seriously analyze the specific local conditions, determine basic farmland in a planned way on the basis of high yield, and vigorously carry out water conservancy construction projects and soil and water conservation projects in the basic farmland, systematically implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, we can obtain a large amount of agricultural products with less land. We can clearly see this fact from the comparative investigation of "satellite fields," high-yield fields, and ordinary fields by the county committees of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi Province. The Investigation and Research Office of the Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China synthesized the investigation materials of 38,000 mu of cultivated land in seventeen people's communes in the area. The results were: For wheat, the average yield per mu of ordinary fields was 160 jin, the average yield per mu of high-yield fields was 436 jin, and the average yield per mu of "satellite fields" was 1,600 jin; for corn, the average yield per mu of ordinary fields was 442 jin, the average yield per mu of high-yield fields was 1,390 jin, and the average yield per mu of satellite fields was 8,414 jin; for cotton, the average yield per mu of ordinary fields was 427 jin of seed cotton, the average yield per mu of high-yield fields was 970 jin, and the average yield per mu of satellite fields was 1,545 jin. There are many such investigation materials in various places, and all comparative materials consistently prove that by adopting the cultivation methods of high-yield fields and satellite fields, the yield of agricultural products can be increased by multiples, several times, or dozens of times. Facts tell us that obtaining a large amount of agricultural products with a small amount of land is not a fantasy, but has a sufficient basis. It points out to us a path of intensive cultivation, high yield, less planting, and more harvest.

The Historical Roots of the Formation of Shallow and Rough Cultivation with Extensive Planting and Low Yield
Shallow and rough cultivation with extensive planting and low yield is a cultivation system that is opposed to intensive cultivation, high yield, less planting, and more harvest. It has existed in agricultural production for many years. Shanxi Province, like other regions across the country, has been adopting shallow and rough cultivation with extensive planting and low yield in the past long years. Under the domination of the cultivation habit of so-called "difficult to produce a thousand dan of grain without planting a hundred mu of land," cultivated land is blindly expanded. The adoption of shallow and rough cultivation year after year has led to the declining soil fertility and low and unstable yields. The formation of this situation is not accidental. In the rural areas of old China, the landlord class occupied a large amount of land and exploited the peasants. The peasants' lives were extremely poor, living a life of "half a year of chaff and vegetables and half a year of grain." Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that people adopted a method of plundering land fertility in order to survive. The specific manifestation of this method is: the amount of fertilizer applied to the land is very small. According to statistics from the Southeast Shanxi area, before liberation, only 50 to 60 dan of soil fertilizer were applied per mu (a dan is calculated at 100 jin, the same below), 20 to 30 dan per mu in the Central and Southern Shanxi areas, and only 7 to 8 dan per mu in the Northern Shanxi area; especially in some areas, more than 50% of the land was not fertilized at all, and the method of "sowing seeds on bare land" was adopted. In terms of labor input, it is generally very rough. Because 60% of the peasants bore debts or rented land, a relationship of economic dependence on the landlords was formed. During the busy farming season, peasants often had to sell short-term, monthly, or seasonal labor to repay debts, rent, or exchange for food, and some even had to provide unpaid labor for landlords, rich peasants, and usurers. This made it impossible for peasants to invest labor on their own land during the busy farming season. Many field management procedures could not be carried out. Generally, there were only two procedures, sowing and harvesting, and other procedures were also perfunctorily carried out. In addition, water conservancy construction and pest control work were fundamentally impossible to carry out. In such a situation of no fertilizer, no labor, and no disaster resistance, the land became increasingly barren, and the yield became increasingly lower, making it even more difficult to maintain life. In order to make a living, peasants flocked to undeveloped land to exploit new wasteland; the landlords and rich peasants who operated the land also did not expand investment in production because the value of labor was cheap. As a result, the fertility of the land was continuously plundered, and the level of production continued to decline. All of these are the historical roots of shallow and rough cultivation with extensive planting and low yield.

The Cultivation System of High Yield, Less Planting, and More Harvest is the Correct Path for Developing China's Agricultural Production
After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the democratic revolution with land reform as its content and the socialist revolution with the cooperative mutual aid movement as its content were carried out. After experiencing the great waves of the two major revolutions, profound changes have taken place in the relations of production in the rural areas of old China. Especially after the people's communes, even more favorable conditions have been provided for the development of agricultural productive forces. According to the principles of Marxism, the development of productive forces promotes changes in the relations of production; and the changes in the relations of production stimulate the development of productive forces. The historical facts of the past ten years have fully proved this truth. According to a survey of 101 agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province, the productive forces have generally exceeded 50% compared with the pre-war year of 1936. While the level of production has improved, new agricultural technologies have also been widely adopted in rural areas, such as the selection of improved varieties, the promotion of close planting, the construction of water conservancy projects, and the prevention and control of pests and diseases...etc. All of these works have laid a solid foundation for improving agricultural productive forces.

However, it should be seen that all these achievements are only the beginning of a thorough change in the face of the agricultural economy. In order to change China's backward economic outlook and accelerate socialist construction, it is necessary to thoroughly reform the cultivation system in agricultural production. In 1958, under the favorable situation after the people's communes, in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, after extensive experimentation, it was proven that high yield, less planting, and more harvest is a correct path for developing China's agricultural production. Continuing to adopt the cultivation system of shallow and rough cultivation with extensive planting and low yield, in areas like Shanxi, not only is there no large area of fertile grassland like in the American development era, but also the lack of organic matter in the original cultivated land, the shallowness of the cultivated layer, the serious soil erosion, and the lack of water conservancy irrigation projects...etc. can only make the soil more barren. Adopting the cultivation system of intensive cultivation, high yield, less planting, and more harvest, not only can large-scale water conservancy projects and soil and water conservation projects be carried out on a small amount of land, and the Eight-Point Charter can be implemented centrally; at the same time, because some cultivated land is returned to grow fertilizer grass, the fertility of the land can also be greatly restored. Therefore, the transition from shallow and rough cultivation with extensive planting and low yield to intensive cultivation, high yield, less planting, and more harvest is completely in line with the laws of historical development, and it has extremely profound historical significance.

The Three Major Superiorities Displayed by the Cultivation System of High Yield, Less Planting, and More Harvest in Practice
The characteristics of intensive cultivation and the cultivation system of high yield, less planting, and more harvest are, first of all, to plant less on the basis of high yield, that is, to gradually establish a basic farmland system in a planned way according to specific circumstances. In the basic farmland, carrying out large-scale basic construction projects, centrally implementing the Eight-Point Charter, and adopting garden-like cultivation methods can greatly increase the yield per unit area. Doing so can not only concentrate limited funds, labor, and materials on basic farmland to fully exploit the potential of the land and achieve the greatest economic results in a short period of time; at the same time, the reduction of cultivated land also creates a situation of technological revolution, forcing people to change the old habits in agricultural technology and implement revolutionary measures such as garden-like, mechanized, and electrified cultivation in an innovative manner. The Duanliu Production Team of the Chengguan Rocket People's Commune in Qin County determined that the basic farmland in 1958 was 50% of the total cultivated land in 1957. On this small amount of land, the depth of deep plowing reached more than one foot, more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu, and four top dressings were applied; in addition, measures such as improved variety and close planting, pest and disease control, strengthening field management, and water conservancy construction were implemented. As a result, the total output increased threefold from 530,000 jin in 1957 to more than 2 million jin. There are many such examples in Shanxi Province as Qin County. Carrying out large-scale technical reforms in basic farmland and implementing the Eight-Point Charter is the first change that has occurred in the cultivation system of intensive cultivation, high yield, less planting, and more harvest.

Intensive cultivation and the cultivation system of high yield, less planting, and more harvest have also promoted the realization of the "three-three system" of land utilization. This has created conditions for the great development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. After the implementation of the system of intensive cultivation, high yield, less planting, and more harvest, many lands were returned to forest, returned to grass, and returned to grow wild medicinal materials, which is the second change. Since intensive cultivation can solve the problems of grain, cotton, and vegetables with a small amount of land, it is possible to free up a large amount of land for afforestation, planting pasture, fertilizer grass, flowers, fruit trees, medicinal plants, etc.; it is also possible to develop fisheries on a large scale using the reservoirs in the irrigation area. In this way, we will not only have relatively developed agriculture and forestry, but also animal husbandry and fisheries; not only will we have abundant agricultural products, but also a beautiful living environment; not only will we actively utilize the potential of the land, but also greatly cultivate soil fertility. Wuzhai County in Northwestern Shanxi has always been known as "barren borderland." For many years, it has been a region with strong winds, cold weather, barren land, poor people, and serious soil erosion. However, in the Great Leap Forward last year, they adopted the method of "abandoning slopes and retaining flat land, abandoning ridges and retaining ditches, abandoning dry land and retaining water, abandoning barren land and retaining fertile land, abandoning distant land and retaining near land" on the original 730,000 mu of cultivated land and determined 240,000 mu of basic farmland. They afforested 71,830 mu of abandoned cultivated land, planted 104,980 mu of pasture, and established five pastures; and completed 12.3 million cubic meters of earthwork for reservoir construction, well drilling, spring excavation, and dam construction projects. In this way, not only did it create conditions for agricultural bumper harvests, but it also laid the foundation for the development of fisheries.

Due to the realization of intensive cultivation and the cultivation system of high yield, less planting, and more harvest, a large amount of funds and labor has been saved, which will promote the early realization of national industrialization and commune industrialization. This is its third change. Many investigation materials show that this cultivation system is the most economical and the labor productivity is also the highest. According to a survey by the Shanxi Provincial Bureau of Statistics of the Hongqi People's Commune in Jishan: To produce 1,000 jin of grain, using the cultivation method of ordinary fields requires 28 workdays, the cultivation method of high-yield fields requires 10 workdays, and the work method of satellite fields requires 8 workdays; the fertilizer required for 1,000 jin of grain is 42,000 jin for ordinary fields, plus 30 jin of chemical fertilizer, 20,000 jin for high-yield fields, plus 12 jin of chemical fertilizer, and 18,000 jin for satellite fields, plus 11 jin of chemical fertilizer. From the phenomenon, planting satellite fields and high-yield fields requires a lot of labor and investment, which seems very uneconomical, but if you calculate it carefully, the yield is higher, and the average labor and fertilizer in each 1,000 jin of grain is reduced. From this, we can draw the conclusion that the cost of planting high-yield fields and satellite fields is lower than that of ordinary fields, and the labor productivity is high. Under the premise of improving labor productivity in agricultural production, a large number of labor and funds in rural areas can be diverted to national industrialization and commune industrialization. This will speed up the pace of China's industrialization.

Promoting the "Three-Field System" Can Avoid the Danger of Production Reduction That May Be Encountered in Reforming the Cultivation System
Since the implementation of intensive cultivation and the cultivation system of high yield, less planting, and more harvest is a process of breaking the old and establishing the new, in addition to requiring us to have the spirit of hard work, we also need to work skillfully. The main danger in this cultivation system reform is: the cultivated land is reduced, the intensive cultivation has not kept up, and the increase in yield per unit area cannot keep up with the losses brought about by the land returned to cultivation. In order to solve this problem, our experience over the past year is that the best way is to establish a "three-field system." The so-called three-field system is, first of all, the experimental field of cadres. The cultivation of this field embodies the combination of leaders, cadres of technical extension stations, and peasants. Through the experimental field, new high-yield targets are proposed and various technical measures are tested to gain experience and guide the general. The second is basic farmland, also known as large-area high-yield farmland, which provides a reliable guarantee for improving the yield per unit area and increasing the total agricultural output. The third is land returned to forestry or land returned to pasture, and land where reservoirs have been built after being returned to cultivation. Although these lands are planted with trees, grass, or occupied by reservoirs, because there are very few forests and grasses in the first one or two years, intercropping food crops and continuing cultivation and fertilization are not only good for the reproduction of forestry and pasture, but also continue to obtain some grain income, avoiding the danger of production reduction that may be encountered in reforming the cultivation system. The experience of Ximawa in Ningwu County tells us that forests and grasslands that continue to be cultivated grow very well. In 1956, they planted 550 mu of trees and 50 mu of grass on 600 mu of land. They implemented grain-forest and grain-grass mixed cropping in these fields, which not only made the survival rate of trees and grass reach more than 90%, but also had some grain income. When the Investigation and Research Office of the Xinxian Prefectural Committee summarized the experience here, it pointed out that their approach was beneficial in three ways: returning land to cultivation increased the processing and fertilization of basic farmland and improved the yield per unit area, which is one benefit; grain is still produced in the returned land, which is the second benefit; and continuing to cultivate returned land makes trees and grass grow faster, which is the third benefit. In short, the three-field system solves the problems of steps and arrangements in promoting the cultivation system of high yield, less planting, and more harvest, and avoids the danger of production reduction that may be encountered in reforming the cultivation system.

    高产  少种  多收
    山西省在改革耕作制度方面的一些体会
    郭忠
    在1958年我国农业生产大跃进中，山西省也和全国其它地区一样，大量地推行了精耕细作，高产、少种、多收的耕作制度。这个革命性的耕作制度，是要根据各地不同情况、不同条件来推行的。但是，这种制度一经推行，就以雄辩的事实告诉人们：只要认真分析当地具体条件，在高产的基础上，有计划地确定基本农田，并在基本农田中大兴水利建设工程、水土保持工程，系统地贯彻执行农业生产八字宪法，我们就能以较少的土地，获取大量的农产品。这个事实，我们从中共山西省各县县委对“卫星田”、丰产田、一般田”的对比调查中，可以很清楚地看到。中共晋南地委调查研究室综合了该区十七个人民公社三万八千亩耕地的调查材料，其结果是：小麦，一般田的产量每亩平均一百六十斤，丰产田的产量每亩平均四百三十六斤，“卫星田”的产量每亩平均一千六百斤；玉米，一般田的产量每亩平均四百四十二斤，丰产田的产量每亩平均一千三百九十斤，卫星田的产量每亩平均八千四百一十四斤；棉花，一般田的产量每亩平均产籽棉四百二十七斤，丰产田每亩平均产量为九百七十斤，卫星田每亩平均的产量为一千五百四十五斤。像这样的调查材料，各地还很多，所有的对比材料都一致证明，采取丰产田、卫星田的耕作方法，农产品的产量就可以成倍、几倍、几十倍地增长。事实告诉我们，以少量的土地获取大量的农产品并不是空想，是有充分根据的。它给我们指出了一条精耕细作，高产、少种、多收的道路。
      形成浅耕粗作广种薄收耕作习
  惯的历史根源
    浅耕粗作、广种薄收是和精耕细作，高产、少种、多收相对立的耕作制度。它已经在农业生产中存在了很多年代。山西省也和全国其它地区一样，在以往漫长的岁月里，一直采用着浅耕粗作、广种薄收的耕作制度。在所谓“不种百亩地、难产千石粮”的耕作习惯支配下，耕地是在盲目地扩大。浅耕粗作年复一年的采用，土壤丰度每况愈下，产量是又低又不稳定。这种状况的形成并不是偶然的。在旧中国的农村里，地主阶级占有了大量土地，剥削着农民，农民的生活异常贫困，过着一种“半年糠菜半年粮”的生活。因此，人们为了求生，采取一种掠夺土地丰度的办法，这是不难理解的。这种办法的具体表现是：土地中施肥量很小。据晋东南地区的统计，在解放前，每亩田仅上土肥五、六十担（担以一百斤计，下同），晋中、晋南地区，每亩田为二、三十担，晋北地区每亩仅为七、八担；特别是有些地区，有50％以上的土地根本不施肥料，采用“白茬下种”的办法。在投工方面，一般也是很粗糙的。由于60％的农民负担着债务，或租种着土地，形成了农民对地主经济上的依附关系。在农忙季节里，农民往往要为抵偿债务、租额或换取口粮，必须去出卖短工、月工、季工，有的还要为地主、富农、高利贷者进行无偿劳动。这样，就使农民在农忙季节中无法在自己的土地上投工。许多田间管理的工序不能进行，一般只有播种和收获两道工序，较好的对其它工序也是潦草从事。此外，水利建设，防治病虫害等工作根本无力进行。在这样一无肥二无工三无抗灾能力的情况下，土地愈种愈瘦，产量也就每况愈下，更难维持生活。农民为了谋生，涌向未开垦的土地上去开采新的荒地；地主、富农所经营的土地也因为劳动力价值便宜，不扩大生产方面的投资。这样对土地的丰度不断掠夺的结果，生产水平不断下降。所有这些就是浅耕粗作，广种薄收的历史根源。
      高产少种多收的耕作制度是发
  展我国农业生产的正确道路
    解放后，在中国共产党的领导下，进行以土地改革为内容的民主革命，以合作互助运动为内容的社会主义革命。经历了两大革命的巨大风浪以后，旧中国农村的生产关系发生了深刻的变化。尤其是人民公社化以后，更给发展农业生产力提供了无比的有利条件。按照马克思主义的原理，生产力的发展促进了生产关系的变化；而生产关系的变革，又刺激了生产力的发展。最近十几年来的历史事实，完全证明了这一真理。据山西省一百零一个农业社的调查，生产力一般较战前的1936年超过了50％以上。在生产水平提高的同时，农村中还普遍的采取了新的农业技术，比如：良种的选用，密植的推广，水利的兴修，病虫害的防治……等等。所有这些工作，都为提高农业生产力打下了坚固的基础。
    但是，应该看到，所有这些成就仅仅是彻底改变农业经济面貌的开始。为了改变我国落后的经济面貌，加速社会主义建设，就必须在农业生产方面，彻底改革耕作制度。1958年，在人民公社化后的有利形势下，在农业生产的大跃进中，经过广泛的试验证明，高产、少种、多收，是发展我国农业生产一条正确的道路。继续采取浅耕粗作、广种薄收的耕作制度，像山西这样地区，不但没有像美洲开发时代那样大片的丰饶的草原，而且原有的耕地上有机质的贫乏，耕作层的浅薄，水土流失的严重，水利灌溉工程的缺少……等等，只能使土壤更加贫瘠化。采取精耕细作，高产、少种、多收的耕作制度，不但可以在少量的土地上大兴水利工程、水土保持工程，集中地贯彻执行八字“宪法”；同时，由于一部分耕地退耕后种肥田草，还可以大大地恢复土地的丰度。因此，由浅耕粗作、广种薄收向精耕细作、高产少种多收的转变，是完全合乎历史发展规律的，它是有极为深刻的历史意义的。
      高产少种多收耕作制度在实践
  中显示的三大优越性
    精耕细作和高产少种多收耕作制度的特征，首先是在高产的基础上少种，也就是根据具体情况有计划地逐步地建立基本农田制度。在基本农田中大搞基本建设工程，集中贯彻执行八字宪法，采用园田化的耕作方法，就能大大地提高单位面积产量。这样做，不但可以集中有限的资金、劳力、物力用在基本农田中，充分发挥土地潜力，在短期内收到最大的经济效果；同时，耕地少了还创造了一种技术革命的形势，形势逼迫着人们去改变农业技术中的因循旧习，以革新者的姿态去贯彻耕作园田化、机械化、电气化等革命措施。沁县城关火箭人民公社的段柳生产队，1958年确定的基本农田为1957年总耕地的50％，在这样少量的土地上深耕的深度达到一尺以上，每亩施肥二万余斤，追肥四次；此外，还实行了优种密植，防治病虫害，加强田间管理，兴修水利等措施，结果，总产量由1957年的五十三万斤，提高到二百余万斤，增加了三倍。山西省像沁县这样的例子是很多的。在基本农田中大兴技术改革，执行八字宪法，就是精耕细作、高产少种多收耕作制度所发生的第一个变化。
    精耕细作，高产少种多收的耕作制度，还推动了“三三制”土地利用制度的实现。这就为林业、牧畜业、副业、渔业的大发展创造了条件。精耕细作，高产少种多收的制度实行后，使许多土地退耕还林退耕还草，退耕种植野生药材等，这是第二个变化。精耕细作既然可以用少量的土地来解决粮食、棉花和蔬菜问题，就有可能腾出大批土地来植树造林，种植牧草、肥田草、鲜花、果树、药用植物等；还可以利用灌区水库大量发展渔业。这样，我们就不仅会有比较发展的农业、林业，而且还会有牧畜业和渔业；不但有丰足的农产品，还有优美的生活环境；不但积极的利用了土地潜力，同时也大大的培植了土壤丰度。晋西北的五寨县，素有“边漠荒凉”之称。很多年来，这里一直就是风大天寒，地瘠民贫，水土流失很严重的地区。但是，在去年大跃进中，他们把原有的七十三万亩耕地，采取“弃坡留坪，弃梁留沟，弃旱留水，弃瘦留肥，弃远留近”的办法，确定了基本农田二十四万亩。他们把弃耕的土地，植树造林七万一千八百三十亩，种植牧草十万零四千九百八十亩，建立了五个牧场；并且完成水库、打井挖泉、打坝等工程的土石方一千二百三十余万立方公尺。这样，不仅给农业丰收创造了条件，也为渔业的发展奠定了基础。
    由于精耕细作，高产少种多收的耕作制度的实现，大大地节约了资金和劳力，这就会促进国家工业化和公社工业化的早日实现。这是它的第三个变化。许多调查材料表明，这种耕作制度是最经济的，劳动生产率也是最高的。据山西省统计局对稷山红旗人民公社的调查：生产一千斤粮食，采用一般田的耕作方法，需要二十八个工作日，丰产田的耕作方法需要十个工作日，卫星田的工作方法需要八个工作日；一千斤粮食所需要的肥料，一般田为四万二千斤，另有化肥三十斤，丰产田为二万斤，另有化肥十二斤，卫星田为一万八千斤，另有化肥十一斤。从现象上看：种植卫星田、丰产田所用的劳力和投资都很大，似乎很不经济，但是仔细算一下，产量高了，平均在每千斤粮食中的人工和肥料却降低了。由此，我们就可以得出这样的结论：种植丰产田、卫星田的成本比一般田低，而劳动生产率却是高的。在农业生产劳动生产率提高的前提下，农村中就可以有大批的劳力、资金转向国家工业化和公社工业化的方面去。这就会加快我国工业化的速度。
    推行“三田制”可以避免改革耕作制度中可能遇到的减产危险
    精耕细作，高产少种多收耕作制度的实行，既然是一个破旧立新的过程，除了要求我们有实干苦干的精神外，还需要巧干。这个耕作制度改革中的主要危险是：耕地减少了，精耕细作没有赶上去，单位面积产量的提高赶不上退耕土地带来的损失。为了解决这个问题，我们一年来的体会，最好的办法是建立“三田制”。所谓三田制，首先是干部的试验田，这种田的耕作体现了领导干部、技术推广站的干部、农民三方面的结合，通过试验田，提出新的丰产指标与试验各种技术措施，取得经验，指导一般。其次是基本农田，也叫做大面积丰产田，它为提高单位面积产量，提高农业总产量提供了可靠的保证。其三是退耕还林田，或退耕还牧田，退耕后修了水库的土地。这些土地，虽然种树、种草，或为水库所占用，但因为开始的一二年内，林草还很少，间作粮食作物，继续耕作、施肥，不但对林业牧草的繁殖有好处，还可以继续得到一部分粮食的收入，避免改革耕作制度中可能遇到的减产的危险。宁武县席麻洼的经验告诉我们：凡是继续耕作的林地、草地，林木、牧草也生长的很好。他们在1956年六百亩土地上，种树五百五十亩种草五十亩。他们在这些田里实行了粮林、粮草混作，不仅使树木和草的成活率达到90％以上，还有一部分粮食收入。忻县地委调查研究室总结这里的经验时指出，他们这样做是三有利：退耕了土地增加了对基本农田的加工加肥，提高了单位面积的产量，这是一有利；退耕地中仍产粮食，这是二有利；退耕地继续耕作，种树种草长的快，这是三有利。总之，三田制给我们解决了推行高产少种多收耕作制度中的步骤与安排问题，避免了改革耕作制度中可能遇到的减产危险。
