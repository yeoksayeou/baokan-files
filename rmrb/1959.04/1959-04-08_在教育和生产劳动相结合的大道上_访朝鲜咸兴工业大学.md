    On the Road of Combining Education and Productive Labor
    ——Visiting Hamhung Industrial University, North Korea
    By our correspondent Wang Yuzhang
    The Korean Workers' Party has always attached importance to combining education with productive labor. At the beginning of the liberation of Korea, students participated in social labor according to Premier Kim Il-sung's instructions of "studying while working, and working while studying." Especially in the post-war years, Korean students widely participated in the labor of restoring factories, agricultural production, and rebuilding cities, which enabled them to receive all-round training. Since the second half of last year, schools at all levels have established factories and cultivated experimental fields on a large scale. Teachers and students have participated in various productive labor with great enthusiasm, combining political and moral education, knowledge and cultural education, and learning of production technology, making the face of school education completely new. Hamhung Industrial University, which our reporter recently visited, is one example.

        Changes in the University
    The university buildings are two red buildings built along the mountainside. To the east of the buildings is the "factory area" built by the students since September last year. Here, smoke is everywhere, and the rotating machines make a rumbling sound. Next to the towering cement kiln and phosphate fertilizer kiln, a group of students wearing work clothes are loading materials, looking like skilled workers. They can produce four tons of cement and two to three tons of phosphate fertilizer a day. In the past, Korea had not produced phosphate fertilizer. The students used the phosphate mines in the nearby mountains to successfully trial-produce four or five kinds, and officially started production last year.
    Next to the cement kiln is a newly built adobe grass house, which is an organic synthesis factory built by the teachers and students of the Department of Organic Chemistry. This simple factory produces regenerated photographic film, photosensitive paper, ethyl silicate and other chemical products that were first made in Korea.
    In addition, there are also mechanical engineering department's practice factories, food factories, milk powder factories, and sulfuric acid preparation factories. The mechanical engineering students are rushing to produce twenty six-inch caliber water pumps, which will be sent to the countryside to support the water conservancy movement before rice transplanting.
    President Li Shihun told reporters that these factories were built by the students themselves. They built more than 1,600 square meters of factory buildings, designed and manufactured various production equipment by themselves, and built seven new factories. In addition, this year the school also planted one cho (equal to 15 mu) of experimental rice paddy, planning to harvest 400 tons of rice; they will also raise rabbits and castor silkworms. All the students in the school participate in four hours of productive labor every other day, and the factories run by the school operate 24 hours a day.
    The factories in the school produced 29 kinds of products in the fourth quarter of last year alone, worth 6.31 million yuan (old Korean currency), of which six kinds were products produced for the first time in Korea. This year, the products produced by this school have been incorporated into the national plan. The important ones are: 1,000 tons of cement, 1,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, 50 tons of rayon, 100,000 meters of regenerated photographic film, 10,000 square meters of photosensitive paper, 100 computers, 15 tons of steel, and 12 tons of milk powder and egg powder. The products will be expanded to about 68 kinds, worth a total of 880,000 new yuan (equivalent to 88 million old yuan), which is more than the total expenses required by the school this year. As President Li Shihun said, Hamhung Industrial University has transformed from a consuming university to a producing university.
    Students above the third grade in Hamhung Industrial University have to work as workers in related factories for three months every year, participating in actual labor. In addition, the teachers and students of this school have also contracted the entire construction project of the activated carbon workshop of the Vinylon (a kind of chemical fiber) factory in the Bungkung Chemical Factory, and undertook part of the design work for the expansion of the Hamhung Food Factory.

        Various Gains
    In the past six months, after this university strengthened the "combination of education and productive labor," the gains have been very rich. The most important of these is the improvement of teaching quality.
    President Li Shihun said: Through participating in productive labor, students have a more practical and deeper understanding of their majors, and have overcome the remnants of dogmatism and formalism in teaching. Students not only learn more and better theory, but also master production technology and become familiar with production organization and production management. In addition, through labor training and learning from workers, they have also improved their political awareness and strengthened their collectivist ideology and discipline.
    Take the mechanical engineering department of the university as an example. In the past, it took 50 hours to teach the structure and performance of lathes, and students may not necessarily learn well. However, this year, 63 of the 120 first-year students in the mechanical engineering department have reached the technical level of third-grade lathe workers through participating in productive labor, and those learning casting have reached the level of fourth-grade workers. This year, they will also manufacture 150 small lathes themselves. Jin Hongshan, a teacher in the mechanical engineering department, said: Obviously, these 50 hours of courses can be greatly shortened, and students can learn more about lathes from theory to operation.
    The example of the silicate major is even more obvious. In the past, this major spent a lot of time just talking about the cement manufacturing process. Now, the teachers and students have built a cement kiln by themselves. Through the production of cement, students have learned a complete set of knowledge from ingredient mixing to firing into finished products quickly and practically. In the past, internships had to be done in factories in other places, which was very inconvenient. Now, they can practice at any time. If teachers and students have any inventions and creations, they can first test them in their own cement plant, and then promote them to large factories if they are successful. Now, the students are studying the mechanization of taking finished products out of the kiln in their own cement kiln. This is a problem that has not yet been solved by various cement factories in Korea. Han Xixing, a teacher in this major, said that in the past, students' papers were mostly general empty theories. Today, the papers are all about actual production, and some papers can be used practically in factories. In the past, the cement course took 20 hours to teach, but now eight hours are enough.
    Kim Byeongyeop, a third-year student of the Department of Organic Chemistry, recently participated in a month of production at the Yong'an Chemical Factory. He said: In the past, internships in factories were like being guests, wandering around in the factory, which was equivalent to visiting and not getting in touch with many practical problems. This time, he worked as a presser, worked with the workers, and learned from the workers. Many difficult problems in the books were solved. He said that by participating in productive labor, his desire to learn has become stronger, and the direction of research has become more specific and clear.
    At the end of February this year, Hamhung Industrial University held an examination, and the students' grades generally improved. For example, the students in Class B of the second grade of the silicate major had the following changes in the results of this exam compared with the exam at the beginning of last year: the number of failing students decreased from eight to zero, the number of average students decreased from nineteen to four, the number of excellent students increased from seven to ten, and the number of the most excellent students increased from zero to twelve.

        To a Higher Level
    The teachers and students of Hamhung Industrial University feel that the result of further implementing the Korean Workers' Party's policy of "combining education and productive labor" has brought the school's education to a new and higher stage. A mechanical engineering teacher who participated in the construction of the activated carbon workshop of the Vinylon factory said: Although I knew about the design of this kind of factory in the past, it was just speculation. This time, when I came into contact with the actual situation, many problems came out. Through this design and construction, they thought of many problems in teaching. President Li Shihun said that the teachers and students of Hamhung Industrial University are now conducting research based on their own creative experience to further improve teaching methods. He said: Based on the current experience, it can be determined that students in this school can reach the level of sixth-grade workers in the third grade, assistant engineers in the fourth grade, and fully reach the level of engineers when they graduate in the fifth grade. In the past, it took two years of internship after five years of graduation to reach this level. (Attached picture)

    在教育和生产劳动相结合的大道上
    ——访朝鲜咸兴工业大学
    本报记者　王玉章
    朝鲜劳动党向来注重使教育同生产劳动相结合。在朝鲜解放之初，学生们就根据金日成首相的“边学习，边工作；边工作，边学习”的指示，参加社会劳动。特别是在战后的年代里，朝鲜学生广泛参加恢复工厂、农业生产和重建城市的劳动，使自己受到了各方面的锻炼。去年下半年以来，各级学校大办工厂和种试验田，师生们以高度热情参加各种生产劳动，使政治道德教育、知识文化教育和对生产技术的学习三方面结合起来，使学校教育的面貌焕然一新。记者最近访问的咸兴工业大学就是一个例子。
        大学里的变化
    大学的校舍是沿着山麓建设的两幢红色大楼，大楼的东面是去年9月以来学生们建设起来的“工厂区”。这里烟气弥漫，转动着的机器发出隆隆的声音。在高矗的水泥烧成炉和磷肥烧制炉旁边，一群穿着劳动服的学生正在装料，俨然是熟练工人。他们一天能够生产四吨水泥和二、三吨磷肥。朝鲜过去没有生产过磷肥，学生们利用附近山上的磷矿试制成功四、五种，并从去年就开始正式生产。
    水泥炉旁有一座新盖的土坯草房，这是有机化学系的师生们自建的有机合成工厂。这座简陋的工厂生产再生照相胶卷、感光纸、乙烷基矽酸盐等在朝鲜初次制成的化工产品。
    另外，这里还有机械系的实习工厂、食品厂、奶粉厂、硫酸精剂厂。机械系的学生正在赶制二十台六吋口径的抽水机，准备在插秧以前送到农村支援水利化运动。
    校长李世勋对记者说，这些工厂都是学生自己动手建设起来的。他们盖了一千六百多平方公尺的厂房，自己设计和制造各种生产设备，新建了七个工厂。另外，今年学校里还种了一町步（等于十五市亩）水稻试验田，计划收四百吨稻谷；还要养兔子、养篦麻蚕。全校学生每隔一天参加四小时生产劳动，学校经营的工厂昼夜二十四小时都开工。
    学校里的工厂仅在去年第四季度就生产了二十九种产品，价值六百三十一万元（旧朝币），其中有六种是朝鲜第一次生产的产品。今年这个学校生产的产品已纳入国家计划，重要的有：一千吨水泥、一千吨磷肥、五十吨人造棉、十万公尺再生照相胶卷、一万平方公尺感光纸、一百台计算机、十五吨钢、十二吨奶粉和蛋粉等。产品将扩大到六十八种左右，共值新币八十八万元（等于旧币八千八百万元），这比今年学校所需的全部经费还多。正如李世勋校长所说的，咸兴工业大学已由一个消费的大学转变成为一个生产的大学。
    咸兴工业大学三年级以上的学生，每年要以所学的专业在有关的工厂当三个月工人，参加实际劳动。另外，这个学校的师生们还包下了本宫化学工厂中维那龙（一种化学纤维）厂活性炭车间的整个建设工程，担任了咸兴食品厂扩建的一部分设计工作。
        多方面的收获
    半年来，这个大学加强“教育和生产劳动相结合”后，收获十分丰富，其中最重要的是教学质量的提高。
    李世勋校长说：学生通过参加生产劳动，对所学的专业有了更实际、更深刻的理解，克服了教学中残存的教条主义和形式主义。学生不仅更多、更好地学到了理论，而且掌握了生产技术，熟悉了生产组织和生产管理。另外，通过劳动锻炼和向工人学习，还提高了政治觉悟，加强了集体主义思想和纪律性。
    就拿大学的机械系来说，过去关于车床的构造和性能要讲五十个小时的课，学生还不一定学得好。可是，今年机械系一年级的一百二十名学生，通过参加生产劳动，已经有六十三名达到三级旋工的技术水平，学习铸造的达到了四级工的水平。他们今年还要自己制造一百五十台小型车床。机械系的教员金洪善说：显然，这五十个小时的课程可以大大缩短了，而且学生从理论到操作，学到更多关于车床的知识。
    矽酸盐专业的例子更明显，过去这个专业光讲水泥的制造过程就要费不少时间，现在师生们自己建设了一座水泥烧成炉，通过生产水泥，从配料到烧制成成品的一整套知识，学生们又快又实际地学到了。过去实习要到外地的工厂，很不方便，现在随时都可以实习。师生们有什么发明创造，先在自己的水泥厂里试验，成功了再向大工厂推广。现在，学生们正在自己的水泥烧成炉上研究从炉中往外掏成品的机械化问题，这是目前朝鲜各水泥工厂都还没有解决的问题。这个专业的教员韩锡亨说，过去学生写论文多是泛泛的空论，今天写论文都是谈实际生产，有的论文拿到工厂就能实用。过去水泥课程要讲二十个小时，现在八个小时就足够了。
    有机化学系三年级学生金秉烨最近曾到永安化学工厂参加一个月生产，他说：过去到工厂实习是当客人，在工厂里东转转西看看，等于参观，接触不到多少实际问题。这次他当了一名压型工，和工人一同劳动，向工人学习，许多书本上的疑难问题都解决了。他说，通过参加生产劳动，自己学习的欲望更强了，研究的方向也更具体明确了。
    今年2月底，咸兴工大举行了一次考试，学生的成绩都普遍提高了。例如矽酸盐专业二年级乙班的学生，这次考试同去年年初的考试成绩发生如下的变化：不及格者由八人减少到零，成绩普通者由十九人减少到四人，成绩优秀者由七人增加到十人，成绩最优秀者由零增加到十二人。
        更上一层楼
    咸兴工业大学的师生们都感到，进一步贯彻朝鲜劳动党的“教育和生产劳动相结合”政策的结果，使学校教育发展到一个新的更高的阶段。参加建设维那龙工厂活性炭车间的机械系教员说：过去对这种工厂的设计虽然也知道，但只是推想，这次一接触实际，许多问题都出来了。通过这次设计和施工，他们想到许多教学上的问题。李世勋校长说，现在咸兴工业大学的师生们正在根据自己创造的经验进行研究，进一步改进教学方法。他说：根据目前的经验，可以断定，这个学校的学生将来到三年级可以达到六级工的水平，四年级达到准工程师，五年级毕业时可以全面达到工程师的水平。过去五年毕业后还要经过两年实习才能达到这种水平。（附图片）
    这是咸兴工业大学师生自建的磷肥工厂，这座工厂能日产二至三吨磷肥。
