Comrades,

I fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward. This is an indisputable fact that no one can deny. The same goes for our construction industry. Take our Beijing No. 3 Construction Company as an example. The building area handed over to the state last year increased by 66 percent compared to the previous year. This is due to the inspiration of the Party's General Line, the soaring enthusiasm of the vast number of workers, and the implementation of the construction method of "more, faster, better, and more economical," which is the rapid construction method of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles. That's why we had such a Great Leap Forward. One construction worker wrote a poem to express our enthusiasm:

	"Thoroughbred horses, Red Hare steeds,
	Compared to us, what are they indeed?
	A factory completed in a day's span,
	A high-rise pierces the clouds in half a day.
	Sun Wukong blinks in the heavens above,
	Do the workers possess some magic love?
	The workers laugh and answer with glee,
	'It's the rapid construction method, you see!'"

This year, the investment in capital construction will increase by another 26 percent compared to last year, and 1,092 large-scale projects will be built. We construction workers are truly happy. At the same time, we feel a great responsibility. We know that the greater the task, the more difficulties there will be. But difficulties cannot scare us. Just as Premier Zhou said, as long as we are prepared and strive to overcome them, then no difficulty can stop us from achieving victory.

	As a steelworker, learn everything,
	Become a multifaceted expert, never idle.
	Learn to be versatile, never be idle

During the First Five-Year Plan, our team completed the production tasks ahead of schedule and in full. Last year, we also completed the tasks ahead of schedule and in full. This year, in order to strive for a greater and more comprehensive leap forward and to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day, our Youth Shock Brigade has proposed the target of: ensuring that 30 people do the work of 50 people, striving to do the work of 60 people, and completing the production tasks ahead of schedule and in full. A month ago, the measures were already implemented, mainly through hard work and ingenuity, and giving full play to the role of multifaceted experts. Now, I would like to report to the representatives on how we have become multifaceted experts in light of the characteristics of the construction industry. We are a steel rebar team. Before 1956, the technical level of our team was very low, and each person only knew one skill. After rushing to complete the tasks of our own work, we always had to wait for work. Although the team members were very enthusiastic, production was always busy for a while and idle for a while. Sometimes, watching other work types being too busy, we were anxious but couldn't help, so it caused "having work but not knowing how to do it, knowing how to do it but having no work to do." Rushing for a while, then being idle for a while. The team members were very annoyed, and said: "Idleness is demoralizing, it's like pouring cold water on our heads," "Feeling guilty for taking the state's money when doing little work." At that time, the solution was to find some odd jobs to do, which was better than being idle, from digging earth, pulling out nails, to splitting firewood, loading and unloading materials, doing everything. Later, we calculated the costs: the output value of one day was not even enough for the team members' basic wage for one day. The result of "using technicians as laborers" was still a loss for the state. How can this accelerate socialist construction? We cannot sit idly by and watch the state suffer losses, we must find other tricks. At that time, some team members changed careers to become carpenters, saying that being a carpenter meant having a steady stream of work throughout the year, and even if there was no house to build, they could make tables and benches. Steelworkers are different; no one needs a reinforced concrete beam at home. Of course, we cannot adopt this method. Fortunately, a master craftsman came to our team, who "knew everything and could do everything, able to kick and fight," and could handle all kinds of ironwork. This was a great inspiration to us. If we were all like him, wouldn't the problem be solved? From then on, according to the needs of production, we learned while working. Over the years, with the help of the master craftsman, we developed in the direction of "one specialty with multiple skills." All 22 team members have learned 16 technologies related to our steel rebar work, including electric welding, gas welding, stove baking, concrete, plumbing, and machine work; each team member has mastered an average of six or more. Our slogan is: "As a steelworker, learn everything, become a multifaceted expert, never be idle." Since learning multifaceted skills in 1956, we have never been idle. We can do everything from digging trenches to lay the foundation, binding steel bars to plastering cement, repairing tools, and installing boilers. Not only are we not idle, but we can also meet the urgent needs of the project and support others. For example, the Beijing Medical College's hospital ward building was not completed because it lacked an iron spiral staircase, which required electric welding and gas welding, but they couldn't get anyone, so they were anxious and helpless. They came to us to discuss borrowing two people for three days. Although our task was also very tight, we could still squeeze some time. We transferred two team members and two apprentices, working in two shifts, both gas welding and electric welding, and completed it in three days of rushing.

	One person does the work of several, not afraid of a shortage of manpower,
	Labor productivity greatly increased

The greatest benefit of learning multifaceted skills is that it can break the limitations of excessively detailed division of labor, reduce the confusion of process overlap, and avoid the phenomenon of "moving back and forth, you do and I wait, wasting time." Learning multifaceted skills can enable fewer people to do more work and greatly increase labor productivity. For example, once, 13 members of our team were transferred to a large machinery factory construction site to undertake the task of forming and binding steel rebars for 160 purlin beams. This work was very complex. The iron plate had to be cut open with gas welding, the stoker had to forge iron fittings on the spot, the steelworker had to batch the materials, and the cut iron plate and forged fittings had to be welded to the steel rebars with electric welding and then bound together. If one process was not handy, the next process was sure to be idle. According to the original plan of the construction site, 70 workers of five work types, including steel, electric welding, gas welding, stove baking, and sheet metal, were required. Needless to say, so many people could not be transferred at that time, and even if people were gathered together, it would take 30 days and nights to complete. Moreover, the five work types had their own plans and organizations, and no matter how well they cooperated, they would inevitably be involved in each other's affairs. However, the construction period required 15 days. If they failed to meet the deadline, it would affect the construction progress of the entire construction site. Our team's 13 members and the original construction site's 14 steelworkers, a total of 27 people, none of whom were specialized in gas welding or electric welding. The task was huge, the construction period was tight, and the technical force was small. This was a great difficulty, but we did not retreat. The team members understood: "This is the construction of a machinery factory, a marshal project. We must not delay by a second! We cannot affect catching up with Britain because of us!" We must ensure that fewer people do more work, one person does the work of several, and give full play to the role of multifaceted experts. Our method was: unified command, division of labor. The progress of each process was sometimes unbalanced, so we made up for whatever was lacking, and the team members could all "temporarily change careers," putting down electric welding to do gas welding, and putting down gas welding to do ironwork. The construction site Party branch strongly supported us and believed that we would be able to complete the task. After days and nights of continuous hard work, on the last day afternoon, there were still nine purlin beams that had not been completed. They had to be completed by twelve o'clock at night in order not to delay the pouring of concrete. There was a cadre at the construction site who, seeing the danger of not being able to complete the task, came to say why we didn't add people earlier, saying that this wouldn't work and that wouldn't work, and his complaints were endless. We said: "You say it won't work, we say it will work. If you don't believe it, prepare the red flag. If the work is finished, plant the red flag, and if the work is not finished, don't plant the red flag." Without saying a word, he left. Our cadres thank him for promoting us in this way. In a moment of urgency, in order to improve efficiency, we increased the power of the electric welding and concentrated manpower in accordance with the Party's policy, welding one purlin at a time and carrying one purlin at a time for on-site use. The "use of troops" method changed, and it really worked. In less than half past ten at night, it was all finished. Under the premise of ensuring quality, the production efficiency reached 518 percent of the quota, a fourfold increase. At twelve o'clock at night, the Party, government, and trade union of the construction site really sent the red flag with gongs and drums.

We also realized that only by putting politics in command and establishing a holistic perspective can we do a good job in communist collaboration. Learning multifaceted skills not only gives us the technical conditions to do a good job in great collaboration, but also makes us aware of the difficulties of other work types, which further encourages us to promote the spirit of communist cooperation.

Learning multifaceted skills also makes it easier for us to participate in management.

We are very young. Our knowledge and experience are insufficient, so we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's words, "Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind." Under the leadership of the Party, we will continue to work hard without arrogance or complacency, learn multifaceted skills, make a big revolution in technology, and strive to complete the great leap forward task in 1959.

### 学习多面手技术大革新  张百发代表的发言

    学习多面手技术大革新
    张百发代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的报告。
    一九五八年是大跃进的一年，这是铁打的事实，谁也抹煞不了。我们建筑业也是一样。就拿我们北京市第三建筑公司说吧，去年交给国家使用的建筑面积就比前年增加了百分之六十六。这是由于党的总路线的鼓舞，广大职工的干劲冲天，也是实行了多快好省的施工方法，也就是集中优势兵力打歼灭战的快速施工法，所以才有这样的大跃进。有一位建筑工人写了这样一首诗来表达我们的干劲：
    “千里驹、赤兔马，
    比起我们算得啥。
    一日厂房庆落成，
    半天高楼云中插。
    悟空云端把眼眨，
    莫非工人有仙法？
    工人笑着把话答，
    这是快速施工法！”
    今年基本建设投资又比去年增加百分之二十六，要建设一千零九十二项大工程，我们建筑工人真是高兴。同时也感到责任的重大。我们知道任务越大，困难就越多。但是困难吓不倒我们。正像周总理说的，只要有准备，并且努力克服，那么任何困难都不能阻挡我们取得胜利。
    身为钢筋工　样样都学通  学成多面手　永远不窝工
    在第一个五年计划期间，我们队提前全面完成了生产任务，去年也提前全面完成了任务。今年为了争取更大更全面的跃进，迎接国庆十周年，我们青年突击队提出的指标是：保证三十个人干五十个人的活，争取干六十个人的活，提前全面完成生产任务。一个月以前，措施已经落实，主要是苦干加巧干，充分发挥多面手的作用。现在我向各位代表汇报一下我们是怎样针对建筑业的特点学成多面手的。我们是钢筋工队，一九五六年以前，我们队的技术水平很低，每人就会一种活。突击完本工种的任务后，总要等工。虽然队员干劲很猛，生产上总是忙一阵，闲一阵。有时，眼看着别的工种忙不过来，干着急插不上手，所以造成“有活不会干，会干的又没活”。突击一阵，窝一阵。队员们很恼火，就这样说：“窝工就是泄劲，就是冷水浇头，”“干活少，照样拿国家的钱感到亏心”。当时解决的办法就是找点零活干，总比闲着强，从挖土、起钉子、到劈烧柴，装卸料，什么都干。后来，我们算了一笔账：一天的产值还不够队员一天的基本工资。“以技工代壮工”的结果，还是国家受损失。这样怎么能加速社会主义建设？我们不能眼看着国家受损失，要另想高招。那个时候就有的队员改行，当木工去，说当木工是一年里细水长流有活干，不盖房打个桌椅板凳也行。钢筋工就不成，谁家还弄个钢筋混凝土大梁。我们当然不能采取这个办法，正好我们队来了一位老师傅，他“十八般武艺样样都行，能踢能打”，是铁活都拿得起来。这对我们启发很大。如果我们都像他那样，问题不就解决了吗。从那以后，根据生产需要，边干边学。几年来，在老师傅的帮助下，朝着“一专多能”的方向发展，全队二十二名队员学会了和我们钢筋工有关的十六种技术，包括电焊、汽焊、烘炉、混凝土、水暖和机器工等；每个队员平均掌据六种以上。我们的口号是：“身为钢筋工，样样都学通，学成多面手，永远不窝工”。从一九五六年学习多面手以来，从来没有窝过工。刨完槽打基础；绑完钢筋打洋灰；修理工具、安锅炉都能干。不但自己不窝工，还能满足工程上的急需，支援别人。例如北京医学院的病房楼就差一个铁转梯没完成交不了工，需要电焊、汽焊，又调不到，干着急没办法，他们找我们商量，借给他们两个人干三天，我们的任务虽然也很紧，但是挤一挤还是可以的。我们就调去了两名队员，带两名徒工，两班倒，又汽焊，又电焊，突击三天就完成了。
    一人顶几人　不怕人手少  劳动生产率　大大提高了
    学习多面手的最大好处是可以打破工种之间划分过细的限制，减少工序搭接的混乱，避免“来回调动，你干我等，浪费时间”的现象，学习多面手可以人少多干活，大大提高劳动生产率。例如：有一次我们队的十三名队员被调到一个大型机械厂工地，担当一百六十檩大梁钢筋的成型和绑扎任务。这个活很复杂。铁板要用汽焊抢割开，要烘炉工当场打铁配件，钢筋工要配料成型，割好的铁板和锻好的配件又要用电焊接在钢筋上再绑扎。一个工序不凑手，下道工序准窝工。按工地原定计划，需要钢筋、电焊、汽焊、烘炉、白铁等五个工种七十名工人。不用说，当时调不来那么多人，就是把人凑齐，也要大干三十个昼夜才能完成。而且五个工种，各有一套计划，各有各的组织，就是协作的再好，也必然发生互相牵扯的情况，可是工期要求是十五天，如果赶不上去就要影响整个工地的施工进度。我们队的十三名队员和原工地的十四名钢筋工共二十七人，没有一个是专门干汽焊、电焊的。任务大，工期紧，技术力量少，这是很大的困难，我们没有退缩，队员们明白：“这是在建设机械厂，是元帅工程。绝不能拖延分秒！不能因为我们影响赶英国！”一定要作到人少多干活，一个顶几个，充分发挥多面手的作用。我们的办法是：统一指挥，分工操作。各工序进度有时不平衡，就那缺那补，队员都能作到临时“小改行”，撂下电焊就汽焊，撂下汽焊就打铁。工地党支部很支持我们，相信一定能够完成任务。经过日夜轮班苦战，到最后一天下午，还有九檩大梁没完成。必须夜里十二点完成，才不耽误浇灌混凝土。工地有那么一位干部，看到有完不成任务的危险，就来说我们为什么早不加人，说这不行，那不行，看那个埋怨劲。我们说：“你说不行，我们说行。不信的话，你预备红旗。活完了，插红旗，活没完就不插红旗。”他二话没说就走了。我们干部感谢他这样促进我们。急中生智，为了提高效率，就把电焊火力加大，又按照党的方针把人力集中起来，一批一批的突击，焊出一檩，抬出一檩，供现场使用。“用兵”的办法一变，果然见效。不到夜里十一点半，就全部干完了，在保证质量的前提下，使生产效率达到定额的百分之五百一十八，翻了四番。夜里十二点，工地党政工团真的敲锣打鼓送来了红旗。
    我们还体会到，只有政治挂帅，树立一盘棋思想，才能搞好共产主义大协作。学习了多面手，不但使我们有了搞好大协作的技术条件；还知道了其他工种的难处，更促进我们去发扬共产主义协作精神。
    学习多面手也便于我们更好地参加管理。
    我们很年轻。知识和经验都不足，一定要牢牢记住毛主席教导我们的话“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，我们一定在党的领导下，不骄傲不自满，继续鼓足干劲，学习多面手，大闹技术革命，为完成一九五九年伟大的跃进任务而奋斗。
