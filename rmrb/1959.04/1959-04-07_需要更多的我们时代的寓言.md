Title: More Fables of Our Time Are Needed

    After reading the fable "Sunflower and Stone" published in the "People's Daily" on February 21st this year, on the eighth page, I felt very happy. I think Comrade Yan Wenjing told readers a profound truth in a relatively artistically generalized way: all new things grow up in the contradiction and struggle with old things. Even though old things try their best to obstruct the occurrence and development of new things, new things still appear in the world with irresistible vitality and grow stronger day by day. As a result, old things will definitely be destroyed.

    The sunflower grows up in contradiction and struggle with the stone. By extension, throughout history, both in China and abroad, haven't all new things and new ideas been produced on the basis of struggling against old things and old ideas? Therefore, this fable has a profound education for those who have conservative ideas and cling to the old and outmoded. It is also a great encouragement to the vibrant and forward-looking new forces of our era.

    After reading this fable, I have this feeling: there are too few fables like this with the characteristics of our era and giving people profound enlightenment. Since the founding of the country, under the guidance of the Party's correct literary and artistic policy, many talented new literary and artistic talents have emerged from the ranks of workers and peasants, constantly strengthening the literary and artistic ranks and producing many moving literary and artistic works. For example, great achievements have been made in novels, dramas, and poetry, which is very gratifying. Perhaps because writers and authors have concentrated their energy on writing large-scale literary and artistic works, few people have come into contact with the literary form of fables. Just open our newspapers and magazines, and you can see this phenomenon: the seat of fables in literature and art is about to be squeezed out. This is a regrettable thing.

    Perhaps some people will think that fables can only reflect extremely simple ideological content, that they are not in step with our rapidly changing times, and therefore are not worth promoting. However, this is not the case. Many excellent fables from ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, do not lose their vitality due to the changes of the times. On the contrary, they still live in people's hearts today, giving people inspiration and education. It can be predicted that many years later, they will still not be forgotten by people.

    Our literary and artistic policy is "Let a hundred flowers bloom." All literary forms, as long as they have new content, can serve the people. We hope that in addition to spending most of their time writing epic literary and artistic masterpieces, writers should also take a small amount of time to cultivate the flower of fables and write more fables of our time.

    需要更多的我们时代的寓言
    山东单县第一中学　顾辛民
    读了今年2月21日“人民日报”第八版上发表的“向日葵和石头”这篇寓言，心里非常高兴。我觉得严文井同志以较高的艺术概括具体地告诉了读者一个深刻的真理：一切新事物都是在和旧事物矛盾斗争中成长起来的。纵然旧事物千方百计来阻挠新事物的发生、发展，但新事物还是以不可抗拒的生命力出现在世界上，而且日益壮大，结果旧事物一定毁灭。
    向日葵就是这样同石头在矛盾、斗争中成长起来的。扩而言之，古今中外，一切新的事物、新的思想的产生，不都是在与旧事物、旧思想作斗争的基础上产生的吗？因此，这篇寓言，对那些具有因循守旧、抱残守缺思想的人，固然有深刻的教育，就是对我们时代朝气蓬勃、勇往直前的新生力量也是莫大的鼓舞。
    读了这篇寓言，我有这样的感想：像这样具有我们时代特色的、给人以深刻启示的寓言太少了。建国以来，在党的正确的文艺方针的指导下，从工农群众队伍中涌现出不少有才华的文艺新人，日益壮大着文艺队伍，产生了很多撼人肺腑的文艺作品。比如在小说、戏剧、诗歌等方面都取得了很大成绩，这是十分令人喜悦的。大概由于作家们、作者们把精力都集中在写作大型的文艺作品，所以很少有人来和寓言这种文学样式打交道了。只要翻开我们的报章杂志，就可看到这样的现象：寓言在文艺上的席位将快被挤掉了。这是一件令人遗憾的事。
    也许有人会认为：寓言这种文学样式只能反映极简单的思想内容，它与我们的一日千里的时代是不合节拍的，因而不值得提倡。但是，事实并不是这样，古今中外的许多优秀的寓言，并不因为时代的变迁而就失去生命力，相反的，今天仍然活在人们的心头，给人们以启示、教育。可以预料，许多年后，也将仍然不会被人们所遗忘。
    我们的文艺方针是“百花齐放”，一切文学样式，只要有新的内容，都能为人民服务。我们希望作家们除了拿出大部分时间写出具有史诗性的文艺杰作以外，也应该抽出一小部分时间来培植寓言这枝花朵，多写一些我们时代的寓言。
