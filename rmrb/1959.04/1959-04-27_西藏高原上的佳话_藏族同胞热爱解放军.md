A heartwarming story on the Tibetan Plateau
——Tibetan compatriots love the People’s Liberation Army
　　
One day, near a village on a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo River, I was strolling with several PLA soldiers. The Tibetan villagers we encountered along the way greeted the soldiers with smiles, as if they had run into their own relatives. Our conversation turned to the relationship between the PLA and the Tibetan people. One soldier, who had been stationed in Tibet for many years, pointed to the surging Yarlung Zangbo River and the overlapping peaks of the Gangdise Mountains, and excitedly told me, "Comrade! The friendship between our PLA and the Tibetan people is like these continuous mountains, like this ever-flowing water, no one can interrupt it."

On the Tibetan Plateau, there are countless touching stories circulating about the Tibetan people's love for the People's Liberation Army.

Two Tibetan civilians in the Gagon Snow Mountain help the troops cross the rapids

One cold night, a certain company of the People's Liberation Army was heading to Danzhusongdu, and a swift river blocked their way. The night was pitch black and it was raining, making it impossible to distinguish directions. The rapids beat against the huge rocks in the middle of the river, splashing waves everywhere. Several soldiers who tried to scout the way returned without reaching the center of the river, shaking their heads at the depth and swiftness of the water. Just as the troops were in trouble, two young Tibetan herdsmen emerged from a yak tent on the opposite bank, each carrying a pole. They directed the troops to a place where the water flowed the shallowest, supported the poles, and guided all the officers and soldiers of the company across the rapids one by one. The night under the Gagon Snow Mountain was cold, and the hair of the two Tibetan youths was covered with ice. When they reached the shore, they were shivering so much that they could barely speak. The company commander became friends with them and asked them why they were so enthusiastic in helping the People's Liberation Army. They smiled and said, "The People's Liberation Army always considers the Tibetan people, and everyone should help the People's Liberation Army."

Tibetan female students enthusiastically help the People's Liberation Army

Several soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army were ordered to go to Chongdui Village to buy firewood. They were unfamiliar with the place, and their Tibetan was not good, making it even more difficult to carry out their mission. At this time, a female student who was on vacation from Lhasa Middle School and had returned to her village took the initiative to act as a translator for the soldiers, finding firewood sellers for them everywhere. Sometimes, when the soldiers were not around, she would join the other children in the village in helping the soldiers wash clothes and mend them. When the soldiers found out, they refused to let them wash. The female student said unhappily, "What? Do you look down on us? The army and the people are one family, it should be like this." Other Tibetan children chimed in, "You run around all day, busy all the time, and you still have to chop wood and cook when you come back, isn't it all for the Tibetan people? We should help you with something." As a result, with the help of the Tibetan children in the village, the procurement team completed its procurement task ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota.

Heavy snow closes the mountain, soldiers fall ill, Tibetan elders show deep friendship

One day, Yadong Mountain became a world of blizzards. The high-pitched songs of the Tibetan compatriots could not be heard on the mountain, nor could the long mule teams be seen. Day followed night, and night turned into day, only the sound of accumulated snow breaking dead branches and the roar of狂风rolling mountain rocks could be heard.

Halfway up the mountain, a car was parked, the accumulated snow already covering nearly half of the tires. In the car, lay a young soldier named Yan Shaocheng, a driver from a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army. He had transported a load of goods for the Tibetan compatriots to Yadong and was returning when the snow blocked the mountain road. The car had to break down on the way and wait for the ice and snow to melt. On this desolate mountain with wind and snow, Yan Shaocheng fell ill, and he fell into a drowsy sleep. Suddenly, a warm hand pressed on his forehead. He opened his eyes and saw that it was an elderly Tibetan woman. When the old woman saw that he was awake, she breathed a deep sigh of relief and called down to the car. Immediately, an elderly Tibetan man with a long white beard also climbed into the car. Yan Shaocheng was seriously ill, unable to move or speak, so he gestured with his hand to ask them for some water to drink. The Tibetan old man understood what he meant and got out of the car. The old woman continued to take care of Yan Shaocheng.

A long time passed, but the old man had not returned. Yan Shaocheng originally intended to ask him to fetch some snow from the ground to quench his thirst, but now he realized that the old man had gone down the mountain to fetch water. Yan Shaocheng thought of the mountain trails in the steep cliffs, and immediately a picture of an old man with white hair trudging through the wind and snow appeared in his mind, and how dangerous it was! He had to pull the old man back—this idea gave Yan Shaocheng a sudden surge of strength, and he jumped up and jumped out of the car. This sudden action startled the old woman, but when she understood, the soldier had fainted under the car.

When Yan Shaocheng woke up, he found himself still lying in the car. The Tibetan old woman was staring at him with tears on her face. He looked around with surprised eyes and found that he was covered with a Tibetan blanket that he did not have, and there was a crackling sound of burning firewood and the singing of the Tibetan old man outside the car. After a while, the old man brought a pot of steaming boiled water into the car. The two old people treated him like their own son. The old man put the soldier's head on his wrist, and the old woman poured the warm boiled water into the soldier's mouth, sip by sip. Then, the old man took out the zanba flour he had brought with him, mixed it with boiled water, and spooned it into the soldier's mouth.

With the help of the two Tibetan elders, Yan Shaocheng ate and drank something and slowly woke up from his coma. Talking, he learned that the old man's name was Su Libanla, and the old woman's name was Quzhen Suolang. The old couple lived in Yadong and were on their way to Pali to visit their daughter. They had delayed several hours of their journey to take care of the soldier in a coma.

When the two Tibetan elders learned that the car had to wait for the ice and snow to melt before it could drive away, they gave Yan Shaocheng half a bag of zanba flour they had brought with them and some food they had originally prepared to bring to their daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren. The soldier planned to buy the zanba flour to use as food and refused to accept the food that the old people had prepared for their daughter and grandchildren, but the two old people insisted on leaving it. Yan Shaocheng had no choice but to accept a small part of it and took out the only five yuan he had on him to pay for it. This made the two old people angry, waving their hands and repeatedly saying no money, and looking at him with reproachful eyes. At this time, Yan Shaocheng only regretted that his Tibetan was not proficient enough to explain the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army to the old people in detail, and he was so anxious that he grabbed the old man's hand and stuffed the five yuan into his pocket. The old man had no choice but to accept the money.

The next day, the ice and snow on the mountain began to melt. After Yan Shaocheng cleaned up the car, he prepared to eat some zanba and set off. Unexpectedly, when he opened the zanba bag, he found the five yuan he had given to the Tibetan old man yesterday was still there.

### 西藏高原上的佳话——藏族同胞热爱解放军

    西藏高原上的佳话
    ——藏族同胞热爱解放军
    在雅鲁藏布江支流的一个村庄附近，记者有一天跟几位解放军战士漫步。沿途遇到的西藏老乡们，都像撞见自己的亲人一样，喜笑颜开地跟战士们打招呼。我们的话题扯到解放军与西藏人民之间的关系。一位驻藏多年的战士指着雅鲁藏布江澎湃奔流的江水，指着冈底斯山重重叠叠的峰峦，激动地告诉我：“同志！咱们解放军与藏胞之间的情谊啊！像这连绵不断的山，像这长流不断的水，任何人也不能把它中断。”
    在西藏高原上，流传着数说不尽的西藏人民热爱解放军的动人心魄的故事。
    嘎贡雪山两藏民帮助部队渡激流
    解放军某连在一个寒夜开往丹珠松多，一条湍急的河流挡住了去路。夜，漆黑一团，又下着雨，分不清东南西北。激流拍打着河心的巨石，溅起一片片的浪花。几个探路的战士都没能走到河心就转回来了，水深流急，每人都摇摇头。正在部队为难之际，从河对面的牦牛帐篷里，两个藏族青年牧民出来了，每人扛着一根竿子，他们把部队招呼到一个水流最浅的地方停下来，支撑着竿子，把全连官兵们一个个牵过激流。嘎贡雪山下的夜是寒冷的，这两个藏族青年的头发上都结了冰块。上岸时，他俩冻得说话都打哆嗦了。连长和他们结成了朋友，问他们为什么这样热情的帮助解放军。他们笑着说：“解放军处处为西藏人民着想，人人都应该帮助解放军。”
    藏族女学生帮助解放军真热心
    解放军某部的几个战士奉命到重对村买柴烧，刚到那里人生地不熟，再加上藏话说得不好，执行任务的时候困难就更多。这时，有一个从拉萨中学放假回村的女学生，主动替战士们当翻译，到处给他们找柴薪卖主，有时窥着战士们不在，就与村中的其他少年一起，帮助战士们洗衣服和补缝。战士们发现后，不让他们洗。这个女学生就很不高兴地说：“怎么？你们瞧不起我们？军民一家嘛，应该这样。”其他藏族少年儿童也七嘴八舌地说，“你们终日东奔西跑，忙个不停，回来后还得自己劈柴做饭，还不是为了西藏人民。我们应该帮助你们作点事情。”结果，在村中藏族少年儿童的帮助下，这个采购小组提前超额完成了采购任务。
    大雪封山战士病倒藏族老人情深谊长
    一天，亚东山成了暴风雪的世界。山上听不到高吭的藏胞歌声，看不见长龙似的骡帮队。白天继黑夜，黑夜到天明，只有积雪压折枯枝和狂风卷滚山石的巨响。
    半山上，停着一辆汽车，积雪已淹没了将近半个车胎。车厢里，躺着一个年青战士，他名叫严绍成，是解放军汽车某团的驾驶员。他运送了一车供应西藏同胞的货物到亚东回来，雪封山拦住去路。汽车只好在途中抛锚等待冰雪融化。在这风雪交加的荒山上，严绍成病倒了，他昏昏沉沉的睡去。突然，一只温暖的手按在他的额头上，他睁眼一看，原来是一个藏族老大娘。老大娘见他醒了，深深地舒了一口气，对车下招呼，立即有一个长着长长的白须的藏族老大爷也爬上了车。严绍成病势沉重，不能动弹，也说不出话来，就用手比划着向他们要些水喝。藏族老大爷明白了他的意思，便走下车去。老大娘继续看护着严绍成。
    时间过了很久，老大爷还没有回来。严绍成原本的意思是请他下车就地捧点雪来解渴，现在他才明白老大爷竟下山沟取水去了。严绍成想起了悬崖陡壁中的山间小道，眼前立即呈现了一幅一个须发皆白的老翁在风雪交加的山间跋涉的艰难形象，而且多么危险啊！赶快把老人拉回来——这个想法使严绍成猛然生出了一股力量，他刹地爬起来就往车下跳。这突然的行动，把老大娘吓了一跳，当她明白过来，战士已在车下晕倒了。
    严绍成苏醒过来的时候，发现自己仍然躺在车厢里。藏族老大娘正满脸泪痕地注视着他。他用惊奇的眼光扫了四周一眼，发觉身上加盖了一床自己所没有的藏毯，车外还传来噼噼啪啪的烧柴声和西藏老人的歌声。不一会，老大爷端了一锅热气腾腾的开水上车来了。两个老人像对待自己亲生的儿子一样，老大爷把战士的头枕在自己的手腕上，老大娘把温暖的开水一口一口的向战士的口里灌。跟着，老大爷又把自己带着的糌粑面取出来，用开水调匀，一勺勺的送到战士的口里。
    严绍成经过两位藏族老人的帮助，吃喝了些东西，慢慢从昏迷状态中苏醒过来了。谈起来知道老大爷名叫苏里班拉，老大娘名叫曲珍索朗，这对老夫妻家住在亚东，是到帕里探望女儿途经这里的。他们为了看护昏迷中的战士，耽误了好几个小时的路程了。
    当两位藏族老人知道车子要等冰雪融化才能开走，他们就把随身带着的半袋糌粑面和原本准备带给女儿、女婿和外孙的一些食物，送给严绍成。战士打算把糌粑面买下充当粮食，不肯接受老人们准备带给女儿和外孙的食物，可是两个老人硬要留下。严绍成只好收受了其中的一小部分，并且把身上仅有的五块钱都掏出来作价购买。这使得两位老人生气了，摆着手重复说着不要钱，并且用责备的眼光看着他。严绍成这时只恨自己的藏语不够熟练，不能详细地向老人们解释解放军严明的纪律，只急的抓紧老大爷的手，把五块钱往他的袋里塞。老大爷见推辞不得，只好把钱收下了。
    第二天，山上的冰雪开始融化了。战士严绍成把车子收拾好后，准备吃些糌粑就开车出发。不料，他一打开了糌粑袋，发现昨天交给藏族老人的五块钱还在这里。

    在1955年一个狂风暴雨的黑夜，山洪暴涨，藏族小女孩如且哈翁被激流冲走。驻藏人民解放军战士湛涣金冒着生命危险救了她。现在如且哈翁加入了少年先锋队。这是她向湛叔叔汇报自己的学习情况。
