Title: Is it okay to demand the independence of one of your provinces?

The Indian People's Union weekly "Organiser" says: "The presence of Chinese troops in Tibet and the construction of airports in Tibet constitute a direct threat to India's security. Maintaining the independence and integrity of Tibet is of vital interest to the life of Tibet and our own integrity and security." How much like Dulles' tone!

The Chinese people have never invaded India, nor have they ever wanted to invade other countries. But in order to quell the Tibetan rebellion and defend our own territory, do we not have the right to station troops on our own territory? Does every country have the right to demand the independence of a neighboring country's bordering province, state, or region under the pretext of its own security? If we follow the logic of the "Organiser," a neighboring country of India can demand the independence of a certain province or state bordering it for the sake of security; after this province is independent, it can also demand the independence of another province bordering it; after another province is independent, it can also demand the independence of a third province bordering it;... The problem is not over yet, the first province can also demand the independence of the area bordering the second province that has declared independence; after this place, which is not known by what name, becomes independent, it can even demand the independence of the rest of the province's area bordering it;... By analogy, where is the "our own integrity and security" that the "Organiser" proclaims? This "Indian Security Theory," when exposed, is a deceptive fallacy serving the expansionist policy of aggression, which reminds us of Goebbels' clamor.

    要你们的一个省独立，行吗？
    黄山
    印度人民同盟机关周刊“组织家报”说：“中国军队的驻在西藏以及在西藏修建机场构成对印度安全的直接威胁，保持西藏的独立和完整，对西藏的生活和我们自己的完整和安全具有切身的利害关系。”多像先前杜勒斯的腔调！
    中国人民从未侵略过印度，也从来不想侵略别国。但为了平定西藏叛乱，保卫自己的国土，难道没有权利在自己的领土上驻扎军队吗？难道每一个国家可以借口本国的安全，就有权要求邻国的接壤的省或邦或区独立吗？如果按照“组织家报”的逻辑，印度的一个邻国为了安全，便可以要求印度同它接壤的某一个省或邦独立了；这个省独立后，也可以要求同它接壤的另一个省独立了；另一个省独立后，还可以要求同它接壤的第三个省独立了；……。问题还没有完，第一个省也还可以要求独立的第二个省的同它接壤的地方独立；这个不知叫什么名字的地方独立后，甚至也还可以要求本省的其余的地方的同它接壤的地方独立；……。以此类推，“组织家报”所扬言的“我们自己的完整和安全”在哪儿呢？这种“印度安全论”，拆穿来看，就是为扩张主义的侵略政策服务的欺骗人民的谬论，它使我们想起戈培尔的叫嚣。
