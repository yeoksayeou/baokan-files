Committee member Mao Tieqiao said: When you are close to the leadership of the Party, accept the education of the Party, are open and honest with the workers, and humbly learn from them, your mind will be clear, you will be better able to focus on the interests of socialism in everything you do, your confidence in progress will be strengthened, and you will feel comfortable and happy, like a spring breeze bringing rain, and feel that the other shore is attainable.

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I am attending such a solemn and grand meeting for the first time, and I sincerely feel extremely excited and honored!

At this meeting, after listening to the work report of the CPPCC by Vice Chairman Li Weihan, the government work report by Premier Zhou Enlai, and the important reports of other leaders, I was greatly educated and encouraged. I fully support them and will conscientiously implement them.

I am an industrialist and businessman from Guizhou. In the past few days, studying and discussing the various reports of the meeting has made me deeply feel that since liberation, the achievements made due to the correctness of the Party and the state's policy of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce are great. After the change in the ownership of the means of production in 1956, while enterprises were transformed, people's transformation, from a political standpoint and ideological perspective, has also made progress to varying degrees. The negative aspects have gradually shrunk, and the positive aspects have continued to expand. Especially after the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, under the inspiration of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, many private personnel actively joined the ranks of the Great Leap Forward. More than 30 percent of industrialists and businessmen in Guizhou were rated as advanced producers and advanced workers in their enterprises. Of course, we cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements and stagnate. We know that we are still far from meeting the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao.

Some industrialists and businessmen in Guizhou still have a mentality that the transformation is almost complete. For example, some say that the high tide of joint state-private ownership has handed over the means of production, and the anti-Rightist rectification movement has solved problems in political standpoints and ideology, so there is nothing more to transform. Some say that they are now working, laboring, and studying with the workers, and there is no distinction between private and public in the enterprise, and they are no different from the working people. Some say that they do not have much capital, and the fixed interest is also small, so when will the transformation be over after ten years?! The emergence of these sentiments of being tired of transformation is due to a complex set of reasons, but for most people, the fact that they see the fundamental transformation of their political standpoint as too simple and easy, and fail to see the arduousness, complexity, and long-term nature of the transformation, is an important reason. If this problem is not solved, it will be impossible to strengthen self-transformation and actively serve socialist construction.

Arduousness, complexity, and long-term nature are the characteristics of fundamental self-transformation, as proven by the decade-long transformation process of the industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, the performance of industrialists and businessmen in the transformation is sometimes fast and sometimes slow, sometimes advancing and sometimes retreating, and advancing in repeated patterns. Looking at my own situation, it also shows that transformation is bound to be repetitive.

I was in the business of motor vehicle transportation. During the period of national economic recovery, like all bourgeois elements, I harbored a strong desire to develop capitalism. When the government implemented the "three unifications" policy of unified source of goods, unified dispatch, and unified freight rates for the private motor vehicle transportation industry in 1951, because I had more vehicles and made a lot of profits in the private motor vehicle transportation industry in Guiyang, I was afraid that this would block the free competition of capitalism and reduce profit income, so I resisted and was dissatisfied. But later, the profit did not decrease, and I turned to think that the "three unifications" was still good. The struggle between capitalism and socialism in my case ended with my temporary satisfaction of greed for profit and acceptance of socialist transformation measures.

In the great Five-Anti Movement, I mistakenly thought at the beginning that this was the Communist Party "wanting to defeat the capitalists," so I first wasted and squandered, with the mentality of finishing things off. Although the leadership repeatedly informed me of the policies, I always thought that this was "a short person's big heart" and could not believe it. Later, it was dealt with in a realistic manner, which greatly exceeded my expectations. Only then did I feel that the Communist Party did not break its promises like the reactionaries, and I began to have a little goodwill. But after the Five-Anti Movement, the government called for active business operations, and I was greatly puzzled, thinking that "active business operations is to make money, and if you make money, you will be opposed again in the future." Later, after the education and help of the Party and the government, as well as the organizations of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, I recalled my treatment in the Five-Anti Movement, which aroused a certain degree of enthusiasm for business operations. After two years, the capital doubled, and conflicting feelings arose again. On the one hand, I felt that there was still something to be done in private industry and commerce, and I hoped that there would be something to be done; on the other hand, I was suspicious of the Communist Party and did not know what kind of end it would give the capitalists in the future.

When the general line was announced, based on my capitalist position, I suddenly felt that the future was dim and my mood was depressed. I was very unconvinced with the policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation. I thought that after the Five-Anti Movement, the transformation was almost complete, so what was the point of doing this again? While hesitating on a wrong path, the Democratic National Construction Association organized its members to study the general line. After several months, I had some understanding of the spirit, and my emotions gradually stabilized.

The enterprise I operated was incorporated into joint state-private ownership in 1954. At that time, in view of the development of the objective situation over the years, and at the same time, because I had received some education, I began to consider that it was impossible not to take the socialist road. Therefore, I had considerable enthusiasm for joint state-private ownership. After the joint state-private ownership, I was arranged to be the manager, and my mood was even more excited. I also wanted to do my best to do something for the enterprise. However, because the bourgeois political position had not been resolved, the capitalist business ideas and work style were almost unchanged, so in the enterprise activities, I often disagreed with the socialist management, and I still thought that "it is always for the enterprise, not for myself." The enterprise Party committee and the public representatives helped me, but I thought they were deliberately making things difficult for me, and I gradually became estranged from them. It was difficult to say two words in the same office a day. Finally, I simply went on strike passively, rang the bell for meals, and took the money when the time came. As for the public representatives, I first respected them but did not get close to them, then I respected them but kept them at a distance, and then I regarded them as strangers. Under this emotion, the spiritual pain became deeper and deeper, and it even developed to the point where I wanted to withdraw from the joint state-private enterprise, thinking that picking scallions and selling vegetables, and setting up small stalls would be fine, but I did not dare to talk about this idea, for fear of being unfavorable to myself.

Just at this time (that is, the spring of 1956), I was honored to attend the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and received some education. In particular, I saw our great leader Chairman Mao, and I was even more moved and excited. Out of gratitude, I thought that as a person like me, what credit did I have to the people? The Party and the people actually gave me such preferential treatment. Later, I was hospitalized and received the Party's infinitely warm care. I was even more grateful in my heart. After thinking it over and over, how could I repay it? I thought that I could only give up the fixed interest, cut off the tail of exploitation, dig out the root of exploitation, and follow the Party wholeheartedly on the bright road of socialism.

Therefore, after returning to Guiyang, my feelings for the Party committee and public representatives in the joint state-private enterprise gradually improved. However, the feeling of cutting off completely in Beijing when it came to the issue of giving up fixed interest was shaken with the passage of time. In April and May 1956, the responsible comrades of the Central Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association came to Guiyang. Regarding the issue of giving up fixed interest, for the entire industrial and commercial sector, they emphasized that the time should be ripe, so I followed the trend and thought, "Why not?" Therefore, I simply packed up my determination to give up fixed interest and continued to receive it until now.

The above facts show that although the socialist transformation of our bourgeois elements is generally said to be constantly progressing, from an individual point of view, it is indeed advancing and retreating, twisting and turning, and repeating. From my own experience, I deeply feel that the points made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan in his report, "carrying out self-transformation according to the six political criteria, strengthening socialist, internationalist, and patriotic education, strengthening the education of the general line of socialist construction, and helping people from all walks of life to study Marxist-Leninist theory and the works of Chairman Mao on a voluntary basis," are very important for our bourgeois elements.

Because the acceptance of transformation by the national bourgeoisie is a transformation from an exploiting, extremely selfish class to a laboring, selfless class, transformation is an arduous and complex process. Therefore, our industrialists and businessmen can only be determined to sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, take the socialist road, and humbly accept the supervision and help of the workers and the masses, so that we can continue to progress in the transformation and finally complete the transition from exploiters to laborers. From my own personal experience in the past ten years, I deeply feel that when I leave or alienate myself from the leadership of the Party, when I resist and disobey the workers, it is when I leave socialism and tend more towards capitalism, which is when the repetition develops and deepens. When I am close to the leadership of the Party, accept the education of the Party, am open and honest with the workers, and humbly learn from them, my mind will be clear, I will be better able to focus on the interests of socialism in everything I do, my confidence in progress will gradually increase, and I will feel comfortable, happy, like a spring breeze bringing rain, and feel that the other shore is attainable.

In the past, under the leadership of the Party, and encouraged by the Great Leap Forward in various socialist construction undertakings, the vast majority of our industrialists and businessmen have made progress to varying degrees in self-transformation. In the future, as long as we sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, study hard, work hard, and conscientiously carry out self-transformation in the practice of work and labor, I believe that in the great socialist construction cause of the motherland, we will be able to advance together with the vast number of workers and contribute our strength together!

Finally, I wish the conference a complete success! If there is anything inappropriate in my speech, please criticize and correct me.

    曲折的道路　深切的体会
    毛铁桥委员说：亲近党的领导，接受党的教育，对职工开诚布公，虚心向他们学习的时候，头脑就会清醒，遇事就比较能从社会主义利益着眼，前进的信心就增强，从而感到舒畅愉快，感到春风化雨，彼岸可登。主席、各位委员：
    我第一次参加这样庄严隆重的大会，衷心感到无比的兴奋和光荣！
    在这次会议上，我听了李维汉副主席所作的政协工作报告、周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，和其他各位首长的重要报告后，对我教育和鼓舞很大，我完全拥护，并认真贯彻执行。
    我是贵州的一个工商业者，几天来在学习和讨论会议的各项报告中，使我深深地感觉到解放以来，由于党和国家对私营工商业进行社会主义改造的方针政策的正确，所取得的成绩是伟大的；当一九五六年生产资料所有制发生了变化以后，在企业获得了改造的同时，而人的改造，从政治立场和思想上看，也都有了不同程度的进步，消极面逐渐缩小了，积极面不断扩大着，特别是经过反右派斗争和整风运动以后，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，不少的私方人员积极的投入到大跃进的行列中来，贵州工商业者有百分之三十以上的人在企业中被评为先进生产者和先进工作者。当然，我们不能满足于现有的成就而停滞不前。我们知道，按毛主席指示的六条政治标准来衡量自己，还相差很远。
    在贵州工商业者中有一部分人还存在一种认为改造差不多了的思想。如：有人说合营高潮交出了生产资料，反右整风在政治立场和思想上解决了问题，没有什么可改造的了；有人说自己现在是和职工一道工作、一道劳动、一道学习，在企业中已经没有职私之分，和劳动人民没有区别了；有人说自己资金不多，定息也少，改造十年，何时是了？！这些厌倦改造情绪的产生，原因比较复杂，但就大部分人来说，把政治立场的根本改造看得过于简单容易，看不见改造的艰巨性、复杂性、长期性，则是一个重要原因。这个问题不解决，对于加强自我改造，积极为社会主义建设服务将是不可能的。
    艰巨性、复杂性、长期性是根本自我改造的特点，这是十年来工商界的改造历程所证明了的。因此工商业者在改造中的表现是有快有慢，时快时慢，有进有退，时进时退，前进中有反复，在反复中前进的。从我自身的情况来看，同样说明改造是一定会有反复性的。
    我是经营汽车运输业务的。当国民经济恢复时期，像所有的资产阶级分子一样，怀着发展资本主义的强烈愿望。一九五一年政府对私营汽车运输业实行统一货源、统一调度、统一运价的“三统”政策时，因自己在贵阳市的私营汽车运输行业中汽车较多、获利很厚。“三统”实行，深恐这样会堵塞了资本主义的自由竞争，减少了利润的收入，因此抵触不满。但后来利润并未减少，又转而认为“三统”还是不错。在我的身上资本主义和社会主义这一回合的斗争，就这样以我对于利润的贪欲暂时得到满足，而接受了社会主义改造的措施。
    在伟大的五反运动中，一开始就错误地认为这是共产党“想要打垮资本家”，所以我自己首先浪费挥霍，抱着一个整光了事的心情。领导上虽多次晓以政策，我总认为这是“宽矮子的心”不能相信。后来实事求是地予以处理，大大地出乎了我的意料之外，这才感觉到共产党不像反动派那样说话不算话，开始有了一点好感。但是在五反后，政府号召积极经营，心里又大惑不解，认为“积极经营是要赚钱的，赚了钱将来再反我们”，后来经过党和政府以及工商联组织的教育、帮助，回想五反对我的处理，激发起一定的经营积极性。经过两年的时间，资本翻了一倍，矛盾的心情又产生出来了，一面感觉私营工商业还有可为，也希望有可为；一面又对共产党疑惧，不知道它对资本家将来究竟给以如何的下场。
    总路线公布，我基于资本主义的立场，顿感前途暗淡，心情抑郁，对于利用、限制、改造的政策，很不服气。认为经过五反，改造已经差不多了，还来这一套干什么？正在徬徨歧路的时候，民建会组织会员学习总路线，经过好几个月，对精神实质有所理解，情绪才逐渐安定。
    我经营的企业是一九五四年纳入公私合营的。当时因鉴于几年来客观形势的发展，同时，自己也因为受到了一些教育，使我开始考虑到不走社会主义的道路是不行了。因此对公私合营是有相当的积极性的。合营后又被安排为经理，情绪更加兴奋，也想尽一己之长，为企业做一番事情。但由于资产阶级的政治立场没有解决，资本主义的经营思想和作风几乎原封未动，所以在企业活动中往往与社会主义的经营管理格格不入，而自己还认为“总是为企业，不是为自己”。企业党委、公方代表对我进行了帮助，我都认为是故意为难，从此逐渐疏远起来，同在一个办公室一天难说两句话。最后，索性消极怠工，敲钟吃饭，到时拿钱；对于公方代表，先是尊而不亲，继是敬而远之，再是视若路人。在这种情绪之下，精神上的痛苦也就越陷越深竟至发展到想退出合营企业，心想挑葱卖菜，摆小摊子都可以，但又不敢把这种思想谈出来，怕于己不利。
    正值此时（即一九五六年春天），我荣幸地列席了政协全国委员会会议，接受了一些教育，特别是见到了我们伟大领袖毛主席，心里更是感动和兴奋，感激之余，想到像我这样的一个人，于人民有什么功劳，党和人民竟然给予这样的优遇，后来病住医院，又受到党无限温暖的关怀照顾，内心深处更加感激，辗转寻思，何以报答？心想只有把定息放弃，割掉剥削尾巴，挖掉这个剥削根子，一心一意跟党走社会主义的光明大路。
    因此，回贵阳后，对合营企业中的党委和公方代表的感情渐渐好转。但放弃定息问题，在北京时的那种一刀两断的心情，却随着时间的推移而动摇起来。一九五六年四、五月间，民建中央的负责同志到贵阳，对于定息的放弃问题，就整个工商界来说，强调要瓜熟蒂落，这样我就顺水推舟，心想：“这又何乐不为？”因而把放弃定息的决心干脆收拾起来，一直领到如今。
    从以上的一些事实说明，我们资产阶级分子的社会主义改造，虽然总的说是不断进步的，但从个人说，确乎是进进退退、曲曲折折、反反复复的。我从自己的经历中，深深感到：李维汉副主席报告中指出的“根据六条政治标准进行自我改造，加强社会主义、国际主义和爱国主义教育，加强社会主义建设总路线的教育，帮助各界民主人士在自愿的基础上学习马克思列宁主义理论，学习毛泽东主席的著作”，对我们资产阶级分子来说是非常重要的。
    由于民族资产阶级的接受改造，是从一个剥削的、极端自私的阶级转到一个劳动的大公无私的阶级，所以改造是一个艰巨、复杂的过程。因此，我们工商业者只有下定决心，忠诚接受党的领导，走社会主义道路，虚心接受职工群众的监督和帮助，就会在改造中不断前进，最后一定能够完成从剥削者向劳动者的过渡。从我自己十年来的切身体会中，深切地感觉到：离开或疏远党的领导，对职工抵触不服气的时候，就是离开社会主义，更加倾向资本主义的时候，也就是反复性发展加深的时候；亲近党的领导，接受党的教育，对职工开诚布公，虚心向他们学习的时候，头脑就会清醒，遇事就比较能从社会主义的利益着眼，前进的信心就会逐渐增强起来；从而感到舒畅，感到愉快，感到春风化雨，感到彼岸可登。
    过去，我们工商业者在党的领导下，在社会主义各项建设事业大跃进的鼓舞下，绝大多数人在自我改造中都获得了不同程度的进步。在今后，只要我们忠诚地接受党的领导，努力学习，努力工作，在工作和劳动的实践中认真进行自我改造。这样，我相信，在祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业中是能够与广大的职工群众一道前进，共同贡献力量的！
    末了，祝大会胜利成功！我的发言有不当之处，请各位委员，批评指正。
