Sun Jizhen Creates Cold Casting Mold, Increasing Efficiency Thirtyfold

(Our Dispatch) Qingdao Machinery Factory foundry workshop technician Sun Jizhen, in the six-comparison red flag competition movement centered on technological revolution, painstakingly researched and, after more than twenty days of effort, recently successfully created cold casting molds (iron molds) to replace sand mold shaping, increasing efficiency more than thirty times. By March 28, he had researched and cast seven kinds of machine parts.

Sun Jizhen is a Communist Party member with more than twenty years of sand casting production experience. Since the factory launched the six-comparison red flag competition, Sun Jizhen often thought: "The casting work is the first key link in the factory's completion of the plan. Other processing departments can engage in mechanization and semi-mechanization to improve production, but casting production still uses the old methods, which has a great impact on the realization of the Great Leap Forward plan." Therefore, he sought a way out from the operation of making sand molds, observing and studying the production site whenever he had time. Especially after the workshop began to promote mud-type casting in February, he was inspired. He pondered, "Mud-type can be continuously cast many times. If iron could be used for shaping, wouldn't it be more durable and standard than mud-type?" At first, because he lacked experience in machining, he was very worried about not being able to succeed, and his thinking was hesitant for a while. After Comrade Wang Rongshan, the secretary of the workshop branch, discovered this, he specifically encouraged him and said: "Don't be afraid, the Party supports you, you should boldly research, if it doesn't work the first time, try again. As long as you have the determination, you will definitely succeed." Li Jifu, the deputy director of the workshop, also specifically helped him with research and design, and organized workers to help build the master pattern. During the research and design, engineer Li Xuesan also assisted him in improving the master pattern device and adopting one-mold multi-casting; technician Luo Congyi also put forward some opinions on equipment improvement. Under the encouragement of the Party and administrative leaders and the assistance of everyone, from the end of February to March 15, a set of special movable master pattern was made of iron. After testing, the quality met the requirements.

After measurement, the cold casting mold has the following advantages: Because it is an iron-cast master pattern, and the inner wall has been swirl-ground, the cast parts are smooth and flat, meeting the design standards, and can be exempted from cutting processing. For example, if the three hundred sets of No. 0.6 sand mixer chassis guard plates planned to be produced by this factory can all be cast using cold casting molds, not only can 25% of the cutting processing consumption be saved, but also more than 4,500 man-hours of cutting processing can be saved. Cold casting molds are easy to operate, and one master pattern can be continuously cast at least 300 times, thus greatly improving production efficiency. For example, for casting the No. 0.6 sand mixer chassis guard plate in this factory, it used to take three hours to make one piece, but using cold molds only takes three minutes to make one piece. After being officially put into production, if auxiliary operation time is added, the efficiency can be increased by at least 30 times. Because the operation and movement of the cold casting mold are flexible and free, it can greatly reduce the production area used for shaping. In addition, it also saves a lot of sand mold making materials and sand cleaning workers.

By March 28, they had tested seven kinds of plate-type parts with relatively complete designs that could be cast using cold casting molds. At present, they are designing special tools and preparing to use cold casting molds in the production of more than 30 kinds of parts.

### 孙继臻创冷铸模效率提高三十倍

　　孙继臻创冷铸模效率提高三十倍
    本报讯　青岛机械厂铸工车间技术员孙继臻，在以技术革命为中心的六比红旗竞赛运动中，苦心钻研，经过二十多天的努力，最近创造成功了冷铸模（铁模）代替砂模造型，效率提高三十倍以上。到3月28日已研究浇铸成七种机器部件。
    孙继臻是共产党员，有二十多年翻砂生产经验。自从厂里开展六比红旗竞赛以来，孙继臻就常常想：“铸造工作，是全厂完成计划的第一个关键环节，其它加工部门都能搞机械化、半机械化提高生产，铸造生产用的还是老办法，这对大跃进计划的实现有很大影响。”于是，他便从做砂模的操作上找门道，一有时间就在生产现场观察研究。特别在2月份车间里开始推广泥型铸造之后，使他受到了启发。他琢磨：“泥型可以连续铸好多次，如果能用铁造型不是比泥型更耐用更标准吗？”起初，由于他在机件加工方面经验不足，很耽心不能成功，思想上一时犹豫不决。车间支部书记王荣山同志发觉后，就特地鼓励他说：“不要怕，党支持你，应当大胆地研究，一次不成再一次，只要有决心，一定会成功的。”车间副主任李继富还特地帮助他研究设计，组织工人帮助造胎模。研究设计中，工程师李学三还协助他改进了胎模装置，采用一模多铸；技术员罗从义也提出了一些设备改进的意见。在党和行政领导上的鼓励以及大家的协助下，从2月底开始到3月15日，用铁做成了一套专用的活动胎模，经过试验，质量符合要求。
    经过测定，冷铸模有如下的优点：由于它是铁铸成的胎模，内壁经过了旋磨加工，所以铸成的部件光滑平整，合乎设计标准，可免去切削加工。如这个厂计划生产的三百台零点六型混砂机底盘护板，如果都能采用冷铸模浇铸，不但能省下25％的切削加工消耗量，并能节约切削加工的四千五百多个工时。冷铸模操作容易，一个胎模至少能连续浇铸三百次，因而大大提高了生产效率。如这个厂浇铸零点六型混砂机底盘护板，过去计划三小时做一件，使用冷模仅三分钟就能做出一件，正式投入生产后，如果加上辅助操作时间，至少可提高效率三十倍。由于冷铸模操作和移动灵便自如，能大大减少造型使用的生产地面。另外，还省去了大量造砂型的材料和清砂工人。
    到3月28日，他们已试验成七种设计比较完整的板型部件可用冷铸模浇铸。目前他们正在设计专用工具，准备在三十多种部件生产中采用冷铸模浇铸。
