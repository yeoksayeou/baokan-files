A mass movement centered on high output and high quality, and comprehensively implementing "four highs and four savings," is unfolding in textile industrial enterprises across the country.

This movement was proposed at the National Textile Bureau Directors Conference in November of last year. The "four highs" are high speed, high output, high quality, and high technology. The "four savings" are saving electricity, saving raw materials (especially machinery and materials), saving labor, and saving financial resources. High speed has two meanings, broad and narrow. The broad meaning refers to the high-speed development of the entire textile industry, including both production and capital construction. The narrow meaning refers to high-speed operation in production. High quality includes not only improving product quality but also expanding varieties and designs. High technology refers to both improving the technical level of workers and reforming equipment and tools to improve their efficiency.

The "four highs and four savings" are interconnected. Increased output must be accompanied by attention to product quality. If quality is not guaranteed, increased output is not only meaningless but also wasteful. At the same time, as total output increases, the consumption of machinery, materials, electricity, etc., will also increase accordingly. If we do not pay special attention to conservation and reduce waste, the increase in output will be limited, given that the supply of machinery, materials, and electricity cannot fully meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward. To simultaneously achieve high quantity, high quality, high speed, and "four savings" is not easy. It requires improving the technical level of workers, vigorously improving equipment and tools, and combining hard work with smart work. Therefore, the "four highs and four savings" must be grasped comprehensively, without any bias, and the goals of high speed, high output, high quality, and "four savings" must be achieved on the basis of high technology.

Carrying out a mass movement centered on high output and high quality and comprehensively implementing "four highs and four savings" can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses and better implement the Party's general line for building socialism. Since the beginning of this year, textile enterprise workers in various localities have launched a vigorous technical revolution in this movement, attacking weak links in production, and powerfully promoting the development of production. In the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year, the output of various textiles increased: cotton yarn by 75.2%, cotton cloth by 46.1%, woolen fabrics by 46.21%, and wool yarn by 32.48%. Product quality has also improved compared with the fourth quarter of last year. This shows that as long as we continue our efforts, vigorously carry out mass movements, we can completely produce more and better textiles with the existing equipment and manpower, and better meet the needs of the people's lives and industrial development in terms of product quantity, quality, variety, and design.

The principle that the "four highs and four savings" must be grasped comprehensively, without any bias, must be adhered to. However, this does not prevent us from having different work priorities at different times. In the textile industry, after the bumper cotton harvest in the third quarter of last year, the main contradiction in production was insufficient equipment capacity. If we had not concentrated our efforts on solving this contradiction at that time—mobilizing the working masses to achieve high-speed operation—the "four highs and four savings" movement would not have been able to unfold. By increasing the operating speed of machines, the broad masses of workers broke through various conservative ideas and launched a technical revolution of innovating equipment, innovating technology, innovating operations, running their own power plants, and manufacturing their own machinery and materials. High-speed operation not only led to a great leap forward in production last year but also created favorable conditions for this year's great leap forward. By increasing the speed of operation and taking other measures, the production capacity of the equipment has been improved, thereby playing a certain role in solving the contradiction of insufficient equipment capacity at that time. Now, the main contradiction in production is no longer insufficient equipment capacity, but that product quality and variety and design cannot meet the needs of all aspects. Moreover, at present, some cotton has more impurities, and the hot season is coming, which are all unfavorable factors for product quality. Therefore, the main target of the current mass movement should be to focus on grasping quality and grasping variety and design. Not grasping quality or variety and design means not grasping the main links in production.

The current central task is to improve quality and increase variety and design. This is an important task for textile enterprises across the country. Of course, while vigorously grasping quality and variety and design, it is still necessary to grasp high speed, high output, high technology, and savings. However, the way we grasp high speed and high output now is different from the previous stage. In the previous stage, the main way to increase output was to increase the operating speed of machines. Now, in general, we can no longer excessively emphasize increasing the operating speed of machines. The current task is to continue to eliminate empty spindles, reduce downtime, and eliminate broken ends on the basis of already increased operating speeds (the speed of some machines that have been increased too much can also be adjusted), thereby improving production efficiency, improving output per unit area, and improving quality.

How can we improve the quality of textiles while operating at high speed? What work should we focus on?

We know that one of the characteristics of modern textile industrial production is multi-machine production. Each machine has hundreds of identical parts, and if any one of these parts is not functioning well, production will suffer. To ensure and improve product quality, we must strengthen the maintenance and repair of machines. We must improve maintenance and repair standards based on the characteristics of high-speed operation, and further strengthen routine maintenance to ensure that parts that need to be replaced or repaired are replaced or repaired in a timely manner.

Another characteristic of modern textile industrial production is that the temperature and humidity of the workshop have a great impact on production. If the temperature and humidity are slightly higher or slightly lower, the work will be difficult to do and the product quality will be poor. To ensure and improve product quality under high-speed operation, we must further strengthen the management of workshop temperature and humidity, and develop a set of temperature and humidity standards and control methods that are suitable for flexible use in the workshop.

A third characteristic of modern textile industrial production is the high degree of integration of mechanized production and manual operation. For example, the main tasks of spinning and weaving workers, such as joining broken ends, cleaning, and changing shuttles, are all manual operations, and the workers' level of operational skill has the greatest impact on product quality. In order to ensure and improve product quality, the leading comrades of enterprises must, on the one hand, rely on the masses to summarize and promote various advanced operating experiences, and on the other hand, organize workers to learn from skilled operators. At present, textile industrial enterprises in many regions have launched a movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass skilled operators. This is an important measure to rapidly improve workers' operational skills, adapt to the needs of high-speed operation, and comprehensively implement the "four highs and four savings." This work should be further developed.

In addition to the above three aspects, improving the quality inspection system, the raw cotton management system, the technical safety system, etc., are also very important. In short, to ensure and improve product quality under high-speed operation, we must start by strengthening fundamental technical management and production management, and we must start by improving the technical level of the working masses. Although these tasks are arduous, as long as we adhere to putting politics in command, fully mobilize and rely on the masses, and conscientiously implement the experience of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," we will surely overcome all difficulties and make the mass movement centered on high output and high quality and comprehensively implementing the "four highs and four savings" surge wave after wave.

### 当前纺织工业生产抓什么？

专栏：社论

　　当前纺织工业生产抓什么？
    一个以高产高质为中心、全面贯彻“四高四省”的群众运动，正在全国纺织工业企业中开展起来。
    这个运动，是去年11月份的全国纺织厅局长会议上提出来的。“四高”，就是高速度、高产量、高质量和高技术。“四省”，就是省电力、省原材料（特别是机物料）、省劳动力和省财力。高速度有广义的和狭义的两种意思。广义的意思是指整个纺织工业的高速度发展，既包括生产，又包括基本建设。狭义的意思是指生产上的高速度运转。高质量，除了提高产品质量以外，还有扩大品种花色的内容。高技术，一方面是指提高工人的技术水平，另一方面是指改革设备和工具，提高它们的效率。
    “四高四省”是互相连系着的。产量提高了，必须同时注意产品质量。质量没有保证，产量的提高不但没有意义，而且还会造成浪费。同时，总产量增加以后，所消耗的机物料、电力等也相应地增加，如果不特别注意节约，减少浪费，那末在当前机物料和电力供应还不能完全满足大跃进需要的情况下，产量的提高就会受到限制。而要同时做到高量、高质、高速和“四省”不是轻而易举的，非提高职工群众的技术水平，大力改进设备和工具，把苦干和巧干结合起来不可。因此，“四高四省”必须全面抓，不能有所偏废，要在高技术的基础上达到高速度、高产量、高质量和“四省”的目的。
    开展以高产高质为中心的、全面贯彻“四高四省”的群众运动，就可以充分发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，更好地贯彻党的建设社会主义的总路线。今年以来，各地纺织企业职工在这个运动中大闹技术革命，猛攻生产上的薄弱环节，有力地推动了生产的发展。今年第一季度各种纺织品的产量跟去年同期比较，棉纱增长了75.2％，棉布增长了46.1％，毛织品增长了46.21％，绒线增长了32.48％。产品质量也比去年第四季度有所提高。这就说明，只要我们再接再厉，大搞群众运动，就完全可以在现有设备和人力的条件下，生产比去年更多更好的纺织品，更好地从产品数量、质量和品种花色方面，满足人民生活和工业发展的需要。
    “四高四省”要全面抓，不能有所偏废，这条原则是必须坚持的。但是，这并不妨碍我们在不同的时期有不同的工作重点。在纺织工业中，去年第三季度棉花大丰收以后，生产上的主要矛盾是设备能力不足。如果当时不集中力量解决这个矛盾——发动职工群众搞高速运转，“四高四省”运动就没法开展起来。通过提高机器的运转速度，广大职工群众打破了各种保守思想，掀起了革新设备，革新工艺，革新操作，自办电力，自造机物料的技术革命热潮。高速运转，不仅使去年的生产出现了大跃进的局面，而且为今年的大跃进创造了有利的条件。通过高速运转，和采取其他的措施，提高了设备生产能力，从而对解决当时设备能力不足的矛盾，起了一定的作用。现在生产中的主要矛盾已经不是设备能力不足，而是产品质量和品种花色不能满足各方面的需要。而且目前有些棉花的杂质比较多，高温季节又将到来，这些都是对产品质量很不利的因素。所以当前群众运动的主要矛头应当指向抓质量、抓品种花色。不抓质量，不抓品种花色，就是没有抓住生产中的主要环节。
    当前的中心工作是提高质量和增加品种花色，这是全国纺织企业的重要任务。当然，在大力抓质量和品种花色的时候，仍然要抓高速、高产、高技术和节约。不过现在抓高速和高产，跟前一个阶段有所不同。前一个阶段主要是通过提高机器运转速度增加产量，而现在呢，一般说来，可以不再过分的强调提高机器运转速度了，当前的任务是在运转速度已经提高的基础上（有些机器的速度提高得太高的，还可以作调整），继续消灭空锭，减少停台，围歼断头，从而提高生产效率，提高单位面积产量，提高质量。
    怎样才能在高速运转的情况下提高纺织品质量呢？要抓哪些工作呢？
    我们知道，现代纺织工业生产的一个特点，是多机台生产，每一台机器又有成百个相同的机件，其中任何一个机件的运转情况不好，生产就会受损失。要保证和提高产品质量，就得加强机器的保养和检修工作，就得根据高速运转的特点，提高保养和检修标准，进一步加强经常性保养保护工作，使需要更换或修理的机件及时得到更换或修理。
    现代纺织工业生产的另一个特点，是车间温度、湿度对生产有极大的影响。温度和湿度稍为高一点或稍为低一点，工作就不好做，产品质量就不好。要在高速运转下保证和提高产品质量，就要进一步加强车间温湿度的管理，制出一套适合于车间灵活掌握的温湿度标准和控制办法来。
    现代纺织工业生产的第三个特点，是机械化生产和手工操作高度结合。如纺纱、织布工人接纱断头、做清洁工作、换梭等主要工作，都是手工操作，工人操作的熟练程度对产品的质量关系最大。为了保证和提高产品质量，企业的领导同志，一方面要依靠群众，总结和推广各种先进操作经验，另一方面要组织工人向操作能手学习。现在，许多地区纺织工业企业都开展了学能手、赶能手、超能手的运动，这是迅速提高工人的操作熟练程度，适应高速运转需要，全面贯彻“四高四省”的一个重要措施。这个工作应该进一步开展下去。
    除了以上三个方面以外，健全质量检查制度、原棉管理制度、技术安全制度等，也很重要。总之，要在高速运转下保证和提高产品质量，就必须从加强根本的技术管理和生产管理工作入手，要从提高职工群众的技术水平入手。这些工作虽然是艰巨的，但是只要坚持政治挂帅，充分发动和依靠群众，认真贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”的经验，就一定能够战胜一切困难，使以高产高质为中心的、全面贯彻“四高四省”的群众运动一浪高过一浪。
