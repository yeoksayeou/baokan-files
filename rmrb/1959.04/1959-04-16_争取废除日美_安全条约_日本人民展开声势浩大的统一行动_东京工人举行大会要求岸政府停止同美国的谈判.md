    Xinhua News Agency, April 15th, Tokyo dispatch: To strive to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the Japanese workers and people from all walks of life today launched a massive unified action throughout the country to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." This nationwide unified action was launched under the leadership of the "National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," which is composed of more than 140 groups.
    Members of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and unions affiliated with neutral trade unions held workplace meetings across the country, launching the sixth unified action of the spring struggle. At rallies held in various places, workers passed resolutions demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    In many prefectures and regions, prefectural and regional meetings were held with the participation of workers and representatives of mass organizations, opposing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." A signature campaign against this military treaty was also launched in various places.
    In Tokyo, members of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, holding placards with slogans such as "Strive for Peace, Democracy, and Defend the Constitution" and "Support the Tokyo District Court's Verdict on the Sunagawa Incident," held a demonstration parade in the city on about 100 trucks. A signature campaign against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" was launched at many stations in Tokyo. At the same time, seventy students went to the residence of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi to petition. Five hundred workers in Tokyo's Chiyoda and Chuo wards held a meeting demanding the smashing of the U.S.-Japan "Security System," and afterwards held a demonstration parade in the city.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 15th, Tokyo dispatch: Approximately five thousand workers in Tokyo held a "Central Rally to Support the Sunagawa Incident Verdict and Smash the Security Treaty System" in Hibiya Park this evening. The rally unanimously adopted a resolution demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement."
    This rally was part of the unified action launched today by people across Japan to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    The resolution adopted at the rally demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government halt negotiations to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement" in order to have the United States remove all its military bases in Japan. The resolution demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government respect the Tokyo District Court's verdict on the Sunagawa Incident. In this verdict, the Tokyo District Court declared that the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" violated the Japanese Constitution.
    The resolution stated that the Japanese people are determined to fight to ensure that the Japanese Supreme Court upholds the Tokyo District Court's verdict.
    The rally also unanimously adopted a declaration calling on the Japanese people to unite and fight to defend peace and democracy and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi war cabinet. The declaration also called on the Japanese people not to entrust the fate of Japan to war criminals.
    Representatives of Japanese democratic parties, trade unions, peace organizations, farmers' associations, artists, and stage workers spoke at the rally, expressing their determination to fight resolutely to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" system and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet. Kutari Satomi, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said at the meeting that countries like Iraq and Cuba have overthrown puppet regimes manipulated by imperialism, and Japan, with seven million organized workers, should not allow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet to remain in power for long. He said that we should overthrow it immediately. (Attached picture)

    争取废除日美“安全条约”
    日本人民展开声势浩大的统一行动
    东京工人举行大会要求岸政府停止同美国的谈判
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本工人和各界人民今天在全国各地展开声势浩大的阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的统一行动。这次全国性统一行动是在由一百四十多个团体组成的“阻止修改日美安全条约国民会议”的领导下展开的。
    日本工会总评议会和中立性工会所属各工会的会员在全国各地举行了工作场所大会，展开春季斗争的第六次统一行动。工人们在各地举行的集会上通过了要求废除日美“安全条约”的决议。
    在许多县和地区，举行了有工人和群众团体代表参加的县民大会和地区大会，反对日美“安全条约”。各地同时展开了反对这项军事条约的签名运动。
    在东京，日本工会总评议会所属各工会的会员高举写有“争取和平、民主和维护宪法”、“支持东京地方裁判所对砂川事件的判决”字样的标语牌，乘坐约一百辆卡车在市内举行了示威游行。在东京的许多车站上展开了反对日美“安全条约”的签名活动。同时，有七十名学生到日本首相岸信介住宅前面进行请愿。东京千代田区和中央区的五百名工人举行了大会，要求粉碎日美“安全体制”，会后还在市内举行了示威游行。
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：东京的大约五千名工人今天傍晚在日比谷公园举行“支持砂川事件判决和粉碎安全条约体制中央大会”。大会一致通过决议，要求废除日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”。
    这次大会是日本各地人民在今天展开的阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”统一行动的一部分。
    大会通过的决议要求岸信介政府停止修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，并且废除日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”，以便使美国撤除它在日本的所有军事基地。决议要求岸信介政府尊重东京地方裁判所关于砂川事件的判决。东京地方裁判所在这个判决中宣布美军驻在日本和日美“安全条约”违反日本宪法。
    决议表示，日本人民决心为使日本最高裁判所维持东京地方裁判所的判决而斗争。
    大会还一致通过了一项宣言，号召日本人民团结一致，为保卫和平与民主和打倒岸信介战争内阁而斗争。宣言并且号召日本人民不要把日本的命运交给战犯。
    日本的民主政党、工会、和平团体、农民协会、艺术家和舞台工作者的代表在大会上讲了话，表示将坚决为粉碎日美“安全条约”体制和打倒岸信介内阁而斗争。日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员裤田里见在会上讲话说，伊拉克和古巴这样的国家都推翻了帝国主义操纵的傀儡政权，有着七百万有组织的工人的日本不应当允许岸信介内阁长期执政。他说，我们应该立即打倒它。（附图片）
