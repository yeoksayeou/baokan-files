Fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state final accounts for 1958 and the draft state budget for 1959, as well as all other reports. I also agree with Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report from the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Now, I would like to express some opinions on the movement to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eradicate diseases.

The people of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, under the correct leadership of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, and on the basis of the great victory of the nationwide rectification movement, have launched a vigorous patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eradicating diseases throughout the city. Especially after our great leader Chairman Mao personally inspected Xiaoying Lane last year, it brought unparalleled encouragement and strength to the people of the city. "We must turn Hangzhou into a 'four-without' city!" has become the heroic slogan and determination of the city's people in response to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's great call to eliminate the four pests. The movement immediately set off a surging wave. Party committees at all levels were determined and energetic, with secretaries taking the lead, the entire Party mobilized, the entire population acting, and relevant departments closely cooperating. Based on the characteristics of the seasons, dozens of large and small battles were launched, one battle after another, continuing the assault to the present day, creating tactics of fighting on six fronts simultaneously, completely sealing five types of holes, combining fundamental and stopgap measures, and achieving quick victories, so that the movement progressed from the superficial to the profound, step by step, wave upon wave, without giving the "four pests" a moment to breathe. After more than a year of nationwide effort, large numbers of rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes, snails, bedbugs, and cockroaches have been eliminated, and termites have been basically eliminated. Last autumn and winter, taking advantage of the rapid development of the people's commune movement and the new situation of leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production, combined with supporting autumn harvest and winter planting, a thousand-person prevention and control army was organized to launch a major offensive against the "four diseases." More than 20,000 schistosomiasis patients were treated in the city. Among 800,000 people, filariasis, hookworm disease, and malaria patients were identified and all treated, meeting the requirements for basic elimination.

Since this spring, in conjunction with fertilizer accumulation and afforestation, a large-scale mass movement has been launched to dredge city rivers, renovate sewers, improve septic tanks and wells, and fill in ponds and depressions, setting off a climax of the fundamental treatment movement to eliminate the four pests. Within three months, the city renovated 259 sewers, improved more than 34,000 septic tanks and wells, filled in more than 6,500 polluted ponds, depressions, and low-lying areas, thoroughly dredged and reorganized the four major city rivers of Shengtang River, Huansha River, Zhong River, and Dong River, caulked more than 45,000 square meters of cracks, and accumulated more than 25.7 million dan of fertilizer, which not only strongly supported agricultural production, but also greatly consolidated and expanded the victorious achievements of the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene.

Through the deeply rooted mass movement, the people have developed good habits of seeing pests as enemies, eliminating them whenever they are seen, and loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene. The incidence of several major infectious diseases has been greatly reduced, and the labor attendance rate has been significantly improved.

The four pests have nowhere to hide; the city appearance has been renewed.

The victory of the movement to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eradicate diseases has made us deeply realize that this is an important measure to develop industrial and agricultural production, a great movement to strengthen the people's physique, change customs, transform the country, and revitalize the national spirit.

Practice has proved that the movement to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eradicate diseases is an important aspect of mankind's war against nature, conquering nature, and transforming nature. The four pests are all organisms in nature, and they use their own survival and living laws to harm mankind. If we want to eliminate the four pests, we must study and master their living habits and characteristics in nature, and take measures of large-scale offensives, quick battles and quick victories, and persistent and unremitting repeated sweeps to achieve victory, and then eliminate all pests, harmful birds, and harmful animals that endanger mankind. The movement profoundly educated the masses to break with the superstitious ideas of ghosts and gods, showing the great power of man's determination to conquer nature. In the past, some people believed that "mosquitoes and flies can never be exterminated, and rats and sparrows can never be stopped from stealing," and they did not dare to wage war against nature. After the movement was launched, the masses realized the truth of "man's determination to conquer nature" from practice, enhanced their courage to control and transform nature, and strengthened their confidence that "we will never give up until the four pests are eliminated." For example, our city's people realized in the battle to eliminate the four pests that on the one hand, everyone must act to completely eliminate the living "four pests," and on the other hand, we must completely eradicate the breeding grounds of the "four pests." When it was discovered that urban sewers, septic tanks, wells, and sewage rivers and ponds were breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, everyone acted, overcoming difficulties in every possible way, with soaring enthusiasm. In less than three months, 259 sewers were converted into underground sewers, more than 22 kilometers of sewage rivers were dredged and reorganized, more than 34,000 mosquito-proof septic tanks and wells were improved, and more than 6,500 sewage ponds and depressions were filled in. Residents of the Siyi Road residential area of ​​Huapai Tower converted more than 300 meters of fragmented stone slab open ditches left over from before liberation into sewers within half a month. The streets have begun to realize beautification, greening, scenting, and poetic painting, and the environmental outlook has been completely renewed. These vivid examples show that once the masses are ideologically liberated, they will show infinite wisdom and great power in the struggle to conquer nature and transform nature.

Drive away the plague god, everyone is healthy.

Practice has also proved that the movement to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eradicate diseases is an important aspect of the great cultural revolution in which the Chinese people transform from the sick and weak to the healthy and strong, and from backward to advanced. Before liberation, the rivers in Hangzhou were silted up, garbage was piled up, mosquitoes, flies, rats and sparrows were everywhere, schistosomiasis was prevalent in the suburbs for more than 50 years, and filariasis, hookworm disease, malaria and various infectious diseases continued throughout the year. A folk rhyme was popular among the masses:

Before liberation, it was a mess:
Mosquitoes blow bugles, fleas do gymnastics,
Sparrows chirp, rats drag kittens;
Bed bugs and cockroaches are numerous,
Bloating, yellow edema, big feet madness...
Those days were really hard.

Since the Party led the people to launch a large-scale patriotic health movement, and launched a resolute struggle against nature and against all "harmful enemies" that endanger the people's health, the dirty and backward appearance left over from the old city and the people's unhygienic habits have undergone fundamental changes. In the movement, the masses launched fierce attacks on the four pests with soaring enthusiasm, repeatedly sweeping them away, and sweeping away old customs and bad habits. The masses said: "Don't believe in Guanyin, don't recite the Amitabha Sutra, these things are all deceiving people, forever follow the Communist Party, hundreds of millions of people are of one mind!" In the past, people never swept the floor or moved the earth during the Spring Festival from generation to generation, and the "ancestral hall" and "great immortal hall" could not be dusted. Now, on the first day of the Lunar New Year, they move all the things and do a thorough cleaning. The city has universally implemented street sweeping and sanitation maintenance, and thousands of young people and women serve as sanitation supervisors, persuading people everywhere and publicizing everywhere. Many residential areas have implemented the practice of brushing teeth every day for people over six years old, using separate towels, using public chopsticks for meals, and establishing health records through health checkups. The good habit of every household loving cleanliness and everyone paying attention to hygiene is becoming increasingly consolidated and expanded. Xiaoying Lane, a model hygienic residential area, has become an example for everyone to follow. New "Xiaoying Lanes" such as Maozhu Lane, Siyi Road, Qixialing, and Qingshuitan have emerged one after another, and a most conspicuous large slogan was posted in the Xiaoying Lane Residents' Committee: "Don't forget that this is the place Chairman Mao visited." The current environment of Xiaoying Lane: trees have been planted, flowers have been planted, roads have been repaired, walls have been painted, and it has become a beautiful place with greening, beautification, and scenting, which makes people feel refreshed. The victory of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene has brought about profound changes in the mental outlook and living habits of the people. This fact proves that the movement to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eradicate diseases has indeed played a great role in "changing customs and transforming the country." The movement has brought great happiness to the people, and people cannot help but sing:

Ideological liberation, every household is full of joy;
The elderly sing and dance, everyone is healthy and strong;
Everyone eliminates the four pests, every household is busy with production;
Mosquitoes, flies, rats and sparrows are eliminated, and new atmospheres appear everywhere.
Where does today's happiness come from? Don't forget the benefactor, the Communist Party.

People's physique is strengthened
Production efficiency is improved

Practice has also proved that the movement to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eradicate diseases is a fundamental and important measure to enhance the people's physique, protect labor, improve production efficiency, and ensure the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Judging from the situation in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, the development of the patriotic health movement has shown a positive effect in supporting industrial and agricultural production by increasing fertilizer, reducing food losses, and increasing labor attendance and efficiency. Last year, tens of thousands of schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, and malaria patients were cured throughout the city, enabling their labor capacity to be restored and enhanced to varying degrees, greatly increasing the labor force on the industrial and agricultural fronts. Other examples, such as raising fish in ponds to kill mosquito larvae in conjunction with sideline production, cultivating duckweed or revolutionary grass to expand feed sources, and eliminating mosquito and fly larvae in rice and hemp fields in conjunction with agricultural pest control, have all directly brought production benefits. Farmers in the suburbs cheered the new changes brought about by eliminating pests and diseases. They said: "Dig one inch of land, the rice grows one foot, increase one mu of land, the rice grows a thousand catties, garbage and manure are good fertilizers, waste ponds and depressions produce gold, thousands of years of old rules are swept away, and double thousand catties are produced more."

Through the struggle to eliminate pests and diseases, a prosperous scene of "increased land production and increased human life expectancy" has universally appeared in urban and suburban areas. Yudao Village, Jianqiao People's Commune, was originally a place plagued by poverty and disease, but as a result of persisting in paying attention to hygiene for six years, the village's labor attendance rate increased from 56% in 1952 to more than 95% in 1956. Last year, the attendance rate had already reached "full attendance," ensuring the development of production. The average income per mu of land in the entire commune was 95 yuan in 1955, 112.3 yuan in 1956, and rose to 179.2 yuan in 1957. Chen Changsheng, an 83-year-old commune member, said: "I have seen from the Guangxu Emperor to now, and this time I have truly seen that there are no illnesses in the entire village. I used to suffer from summer sickness every summer and dysentery in the autumn, but in the past three years, I have not had any minor ailments." He said with a smile: "I want to live another 20 years, to live to be 103 years old!" Factories attach importance to eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene, which reduces diseases and reduces absenteeism due to illness, ensuring production. For example, after Hua Feng Paper Mill improved hygiene, the absenteeism rate in the second quarter of last year decreased by 63% compared with the same period of the previous year. Due to the special production conditions of the Zhejiang Construction Fourth Construction Site, the sanitary conditions were not good. After three months of hard work, 12 large and small ponds were filled in, 50,000 square meters of weeds were removed, and the kitchens and dormitories were tidied up neatly. In the summer of 1957, the dormitory was used as a ward, and last summer, the ward was used as a dormitory. The workers' attendance rate increased from 92% to 98%, which strongly guaranteed production.

The movement to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eradicate diseases is an unprecedented feat. In history, no one has ever been able to actively, systematically, and on a large scale mobilize the broad masses to launch an attack on pests, harmful birds, and harmful animals that endanger the people. Only the liberated Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party, dare to undertake such a great combat mission and achieve great victories. We deeply feel that only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, only in our superior socialist country, can we create earth-shattering miracles.

Eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eradicating diseases is an extremely glorious task entrusted to us by the Party and Chairman Mao, and it is also an important part of our people's cultural revolution. The people of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, will never fail the deep concern given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao. We must further implement the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on continuing to carry out the movement to eliminate the four pests in the new situation of a comprehensive leap forward in production, make persistent efforts, advance victoriously, and strive to realize the "four-without" city ahead of schedule, making the world-famous West Lake even more clean and beautiful, and presenting a gift to the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the country!

Finally, I wish all the committee members good health.

    如今西子更秀丽
    陈礼节委员谈杭州市除四害讲卫生消灭疾病的成绩各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告以及其他各项报告，并同意李维汉副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。
    现在我就除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动，发表一点意见。
    我们浙江省杭州市的人民遵循党中央和国务院关于除四害、讲卫生的指示，在省、市委的正确领导下和全国整风运动伟大胜利的基础上，在全市范围内轰轰烈烈地开展了以除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动。特别是去年我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲临小营巷查看卫生以后，给全市人民带来了无比的鼓舞和力量。“一定要把杭州市变成‘四无’城市！”成了全市人民响应党中央和毛主席关于除四害伟大号召的豪迈行动口号和决心。运动立即掀起了奔腾澎湃的浪潮。各级党委决心强、干劲足，书记挂帅，全党动员，全民动手，有关部门密切配合，根据季节特点，发动了大小战役数十场，一个战斗接着一个战斗，一直突击到现在，创造了六战并举、大封五洞、本标兼施、速战速决的战术，使运动由浅入深，一步紧一步，一浪高一浪，不给“四害”以片刻喘息之机。经过一年多来的全民奋战，歼灭了大量的老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子、钉螺、臭虫、蟑螂，并且基本消灭了白蚁。去年秋冬季，乘人民公社运动迅速发展和工农业生产飞跃前进的新形势，结合支援秋收、冬种，又组织了千人防治大军，向“四病”大举进攻，全市治疗了二万多名血吸虫病病人，在八十万群众中查清丝虫病、钩虫病和疟疾病人，全部经过治疗，达到基本消灭的要求。
    今春以来，结合积肥、绿化又开展了规模巨大的疏浚城河，改造下水道，改良窨缸、窨井和填垫塘、荡的群众运动，掀起了除四害治本运动的高潮。三个月内，全市共改造下水道二百五十九条，改良窨缸、窨井三万四千多只，填平污塘、荡、洼地六千五百多处，彻底疏浚整理了聖塘河、浣沙河、中河和东河等四大城河，嵌缝四万五千多平方公尺，积肥二千五百七十余万担，既有力地支援了农业生产，又大大地巩固和扩大了除四害、讲卫生运动的胜利成果。
    通过深入人心的群众运动，人民群众养成了视害为敌、随见随灭和爱清洁、讲卫生的良好风气，几种主要传染病的发病率大大降低，劳动出勤率显著提高。
    四害无处存身  市容焕然一新
    除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动的胜利，使我们深深体会到这是一项发展工农业生产的重要措施，是增强人民体质，移风易俗，改造国家，振奋民族精神的伟大运动。
    实践证明，除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动是人类向自然开战、征服自然、改造自然斗争的一个重要方面。四害都是自然界的生物，它们是用自己的生存和生活规律来危害人类的。我们要消灭四害就必须研究和掌握它们在自然界的生活规律和特点，采取大举进攻，速战速决，并且坚持不懈的反复扫荡的措施，才能取得胜利，并且进而消灭所有一切危害人类的害虫害鸟害兽。运动深刻地教育了人民群众打破迷信鬼神的思想，显示出人定胜天的伟大力量。过去有人认为“蚊蝇灭不尽，鼠雀偷不穷”，不敢向自然开战。运动开展后，群众从实践中认识了“人定胜天”的真理，增强了控制和改造自然的勇气，坚定了“四害不除，决不罢休”的信心。如我们全市人民在除四害战斗中认识到，一方面要人人动手全歼活的“四害”，一方面还要彻底铲除“四害”的孳生地。当发现城市里的阴沟、窨缸、窨井、污水河塘等是蚊蝇的巢穴后，就大家动手，千方百计，克服困难，干劲冲天，不到三个月，就将二百五十九条阴沟改建成土下水道，疏浚整理了二十二公里多长的污水河，改良了三万四千多只防蚊蝇的窨缸、窨井，填平了六千五百多处污水塘、洼。花牌楼四宜路居民区在半个月内，就将解放前遗留下来的支离破碎的三百多公尺长的石板明沟，改建成下水道，街道已开始实现了美化、绿化、香化、诗画化，环境面貌焕然一新。这些生动的事例，说明了群众一旦思想解放，在征服自然和改造自然的斗争中便显示了无穷的智慧和巨大的力量。
    驱掉瘟神  人人健康
    实践又证明除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动是我国人民转病弱为健强，变落后为先进的伟大文化革命的一个重要方面。解放以前，杭州市内河道淤塞，垃圾成堆，蚊蝇鼠雀到处皆是，城郊血吸虫病流行了五十多年，丝虫病、钩虫病、疟疾和各种传染病常年不断。群众中流传着这样一首歌谣：
    解放前，一团糟：
    蚊子吹洋号，跳蚤操体操，
    麻雀吱吱叫，老鼠拖小猫；
    臭虫、蟑螂木佬佬，
    膨胀、黄胖、大脚疯……
    那种日子真难熬。
    自从党领导人民开展了大规模的爱国卫生运动，向自然界，向一切危害人民健康的“害敌”开展了坚决的斗争，旧城市遗留下来的肮脏落后面貌和人民群众不讲卫生的习惯，有了根本的改变。在运动中，群众以冲天的干劲，向四害猛烈进攻，反复扫荡，陈风陋俗一扫而光。群众说：“不信观世音，不念弥陀经，这些东西尽骗人，永远跟着共产党，千百万人一条心！”在过去，人们世世代代春节不扫地，不动土，“祖宗堂”“大仙堂”掸不得，现在大年初一就百物大搬家，彻底大扫除。全市普遍实行街道自扫保洁，成千上万少年、妇女卫生监督岗，逢人劝说，到处宣传。很多居民区推行六岁以上的人每天刷牙，毛巾分用，合食公筷，并且通过健康检查，建立了健康档案。家家爱清洁，人人讲卫生的良好风气日益巩固、扩大，卫生模范居民区小营巷成了大家追赶的榜样，毛竹弄、四宜路、栖霞岭、清水潭等新的“小营巷”接踵出现，而小营巷居民委员会里贴上了一张最显目的大标语：“不要忘记这里是毛主席到过的地方”，小营巷现在的环境：种了树，栽了花，修了路，粉了墙，成了绿化、美化、香化，令人心旷神怡的美好地方。除四害讲卫生的胜利，使人民群众在精神面貌和生活习惯上起着深刻的变化。此事实证明：除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动确实起了“移风易俗，改造国家”的伟大作用。运动给人们带来了很大幸福，人们情不自禁地歌唱：
    思想大解放，家家喜洋洋；
    老年歌又舞，人人健又壮；
    个个除四害，户户生产忙；
    蚊蝇鼠雀消灭光，到处出现新气象。
    今天幸福那里来？不忘恩人共产党。
    人民体质增强
    生产效率提高
    实践还证明除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动是增强人民体质，保护劳动力，提高生产效率，保障工农业生产大跃进的一项带根本性的重要措施。从浙江省杭州市的情况来看，爱国卫生运动的开展，已经从增加肥料，减少粮食损耗，提高劳动出勤率和劳动效率，显示出了支援工农业生产的积极作用。去年全市治愈的血吸虫病、丝虫病、钩虫病和疟疾病人成千上万，使他们的劳动能力有了不同程度的恢复和增强，大大增加了工农业战线上的劳动力。其他如水塘养鱼灭孑孓结合副业生产，培育浮萍或革命草扩大饲料来源，消灭水稻、棉麻地蚊蝇幼虫结合农业治虫等，都直接带来了生产的收益。郊区农民欢呼除害灭病带来的新变化，他们说：“挖地一寸，稻长一尺，增地一亩，稻长千斤，垃圾粪便肥料好，废塘、洼地出黄金，千年陈规一扫清，多出双千斤”。
    通过除害灭病的斗争，城郊区普遍出现了“田增产，人增寿”的兴盛气象。笕桥人民公社的御道村，原来是一个贫病交迫的地方，但由于六年如一日地坚持讲卫生的结果，全村劳动出勤率由一九五二年的百分之五十六提高到一九五六年的百分之九十五以上，去年出勤率已经达到了“满堂红”，保证了生产的发展。全社每亩土地的平均收入，一九五五年为九十五元，一九五六年为一百一十二元三角，一九五七年上升到一百七十九元二角。八十三岁的老社员陈长生说：“我从光绪皇帝看到现在，这回真正看到全村没有毛病。我从前每逢夏天疰夏，秋天泻痢，可是近三年来，却一点小毛病也没有了。”他笑着说：“我想再活二十年，要活一百零三岁呢！”工厂重视了除四害讲卫生，疾病减少，因病缺勤率降低，保证了生产。如华丰造纸厂搞好了卫生，去年第二季度缺勤率比前年同期下降了百分之六十三。浙建四工地由于生产上的特殊条件，卫生情况不好，经过三个月的苦战，填平了大小水塘十二处，铲除杂草五万平方，厨房、宿舍收拾得整整洁洁，一九五七年夏天宿舍作病房，去年夏天病房作宿舍，工人出勤率从百分之九十二上升到百分之九十八，有力的保证了生产。
    除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动是前无古人的壮举，历史上从来没有人能主动地有组织地大规模地发动广大群众向危害人民的害虫、害鸟、害兽发动进攻。只有解放了的中国人民，在党的领导下，才敢于担当起这样一个伟大的战斗任务，并取得伟大胜利。我们深深地感到只有在共产党的英明领导下，只有在我们的优越的社会主义国家里，才能创造出惊天动地的奇迹。
    除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病，是党和毛主席交给我们的一项极其光荣的任务，也是我国人民文化革命的一个重要组成部分。我们浙江省杭州市人民决不辜负党和毛主席给予我们的深切关怀，一定要在生产全面大跃进的新形势下，进一步贯彻中共中央关于继续开展除四害运动的决定，再接再厉，乘胜前进，力争提前实现“四无”市，使闻名世界的西子，更加整洁秀丽，向伟大的建国十周年献礼！
    最后祝各位委员身体健康。
