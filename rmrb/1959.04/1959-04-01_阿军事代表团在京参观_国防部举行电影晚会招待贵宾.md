Xinhua News Agency, March 31st – The Algerian military delegation today visited a tank school of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Beijing No. 8 Middle School. The delegation's leader, Omar Oussedik, gave a report to more than 800 high school students.

　　This afternoon, the distinguished guests, accompanied by Lieutenant General Yang Xiushan, representative of the Ministry of National Defense, and Senior Colonel Zhang Bingyu, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, were warmly welcomed by hundreds of students lining the streets as they arrived at No. 8 Middle School.

　　Omar Oussedik stepped onto the podium amidst warm applause. In his report, he elaborated on the heroic struggle of the Algerian people for independence and peace. He said that under the enslavement of French colonialists, countless Algerian youths had no opportunity to study. Every day, young students were killed by the French invading army. However, patriotic Algerian youth would not yield; for the sake of a happy tomorrow, they rushed to the front lines to wage a resolute struggle against the enemy. Omar Oussedik expressed his hope that this visit would further enhance the friendship between Chinese and Algerian youth and students.

　　This morning, while visiting a tank school of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Omar Oussedik, on behalf of the Algerian National Liberation Army, presented a national flag and commemorative badges to the tank school. The leaders of the tank school also presented the delegation with a commemorative album of pictures documenting the school's study and life. In the evening, the Ministry of National Defense held a film reception to entertain the distinguished guests.
