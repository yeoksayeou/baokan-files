    The upper left picture shows the People's Militia led by Komsomol member and college student Jersakov, one of the hundreds of newly established People's Militias in enterprises and schools in Leningrad, Soviet Union. This militia supervises order in streets, theaters, and shops. The members are relentless when they encounter acts that disrupt socialist order. Because of their outstanding work, they have been praised several times by the public security organs and the Komsomol district committees. In the Zhytomyr Oblast, about 900 People's Militias have also been established, with a total of 30,000 members. Each member wears a red armband. This force, which safeguards social order, enjoys high prestige.
    The People's Militia and Comrades' Courts are voluntary organizations that have recently been widely established throughout the Soviet Union. They urge people to abide by the norms of social life and try improper behavior in the lives of individual members. Some functions that previously belonged entirely to the public security organs and courts have begun to be transferred to the People's Militia and Comrades' Courts, that is to say, the issue of safeguarding social order and the norms of socialist public life has gradually shifted from state machinery to social organizations.

    人民纠察队威信高
    开始执行法院职能
    左上图是由共青团员、大学生皆尔萨科夫领导的人民纠察队，是苏联列宁格勒市企业和学校新成立的几百个人民纠察队中的一个。这个纠察队监督大街、剧院和商店中的秩序。遇到破坏社会主义秩序的行为，队员们是毫不留情的。由于他们工作出色，已经得到民警机关和共青团区委会的好几次表扬。在日托米尔州也成立了约九百个人民纠察队，共有三万个队员。每个队员臂上都有一条红布带。这支保障社会秩序的队伍享有很高的威信。
    人民纠察队和同志审判会，是最近苏联各地普遍建立的志愿组织，它们督促人们遵守社会生活准则，审理个别成员生活中的不正当行为。一些不久以前完全属于民警机关和法院的职能，开始移交给人民纠察队和同志审判会，也就是说，保障社会秩序和社会主义公共生活准则的问题，已经由国家机器逐渐转变为社会团体来处理了。
