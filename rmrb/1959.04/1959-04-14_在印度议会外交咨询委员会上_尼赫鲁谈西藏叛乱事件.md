Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: According to a dispatch from the Indian News Service, the Press Trust of India reported that Indian Prime Minister Nehru spoke on the Tibetan rebellion on April 10th at the Foreign Affairs Advisory Committee of the Parliament. According to reports, Nehru expressed in his speech his desire to maintain friendly relations with China. He does not want to leave any traces of ill will in India on this issue. Prime Minister Nehru also expressed his concern about this issue. He said that Sino-Indian relations cannot be allowed to deteriorate.

Nehru emphasized that it is urgently necessary to avoid a Cold War atmosphere following the events in Tibet arriving in India.

Nehru reiterated that he believes India cannot adopt an "open door policy" of accepting every refugee from Tibet. He said that since March 1st of this year, only seven Tibetan refugees have come to India, apart from the eighty people accompanying the Dalai Lama. There is no large-scale migration of refugees. A large influx of refugees would not be in the interests of the Tibetans themselves, as it would deprive them of proper leadership.

However, Nehru reiterated his view of the Tibetan rebellion, believing that the foundation of the Tibetan rebellion is deeply rooted in national sentiment.

Nehru said that the mountain resorts being considered for the Dalai Lama to reside in include Mussoorie (in northern Uttar Pradesh) and Simla (in northern Punjab, 170 miles north of New Delhi).

When asked if it would be possible to convene a second Bandung Conference to resolve differences between Asian and African countries on various international issues, Nehru replied that, at present, achieving a "common ground" for discussing issues would require great effort.

　　在印度议会外交咨询委员会上
　　尼赫鲁谈西藏叛乱事件
    新华社13日讯　据印度新闻处电讯，印度报业托辣斯报道，印度总理尼赫鲁10日在议会外交咨询委员会就西藏叛乱事件发表讲话。据报道，尼赫鲁在讲话中表示渴望保持同中国的友好关系。他不希望在这个问题上在印度留下任何恶感的痕迹。尼赫鲁总理还表示他对这个问题感到忧虑。他说，不可以让中印关系恶化。
    尼赫鲁强调，迫切需要避免冷战气氛紧随着西藏发生的事件之后来到印度。
    尼赫鲁重申，他认为印度不能采取接纳来自西藏的每一个难民的“开门政策”。他说，自从今年3月1日以来，除了达赖喇嘛随行的八十个人以外，只有七名西藏难民来到印度。没有大批难民迁移的事。大批难民涌入将不符合西藏人自己的利益，因为那将使他们失去适当的领导。
    但是，尼赫鲁又重申他对西藏叛乱的看法，他认为，西藏叛乱的基础根子深深地扎在民族情绪中。
    尼赫鲁说，考虑供达赖喇嘛居住的山间胜地中有穆索里（在北方邦北部）和西姆拉（在旁遮普邦北部、新德里以北一百七十英里）。
    有人问尼赫鲁是否可能召开第二次万隆会议来解决亚非国家在各种国际问题上的分歧，他回答说，目前，要取得讨论问题的“共同基础”，就需要作出很大的努力。
