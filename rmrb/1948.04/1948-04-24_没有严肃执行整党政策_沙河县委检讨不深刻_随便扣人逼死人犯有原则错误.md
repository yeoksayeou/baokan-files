Failure to Seriously Implement Party Rectification Policy
Shahe County Party Committee's Insufficient Self-Criticism
Arbitrary Detention Leading to Death Constitutes a Matter of Principle
Disregarding Mass Demands, Subjectively Imposing Own Ideas

[This Newspaper Dispatches] The Shahe County Party Committee and land reform work team leaders held a joint meeting on the 8th of this month to review the democratic party rectification and filling-in work in the county's 32 villages over the past month and a half. The review concluded that a new style of work had begun to emerge. Staff members were starting to learn to connect with the masses, promptly collect and reflect information, and conduct work based on the masses' sentiments and demands. Some work teams also continuously reviewed their work, promptly held meetings to study problems, actively sought solutions, and leveraged collective leadership. Progress had also been made in party rectification. For example, the Shangxian Village Farmers' Association Director had transformed from being passively resistant, uncooperative, and unrepentant to being highly proactive and responsible. However, on the other hand, there were still significant shortcomings. In addition to the County Party Committee's own self-criticism, the main flaw in the work teams' style was being overly hasty. For example, after the second round of class designation in Baicuo Village, the work team developed a "rush to the third round" mentality, and conducted elections for the Farmers' Representative Conference before conditions were ripe. In Shangzheng Village and Zhongguan Village, the work teams heard that Nangaoli had established a Farmers' Representative Conference, and without designating classes, regardless of the masses' awareness, and without proper preparation, they subjectively lectured the masses on "three conditions" and then called for elections. As a result, those elected were all old men and women (the youngest being 45 years old), and none of them were Party members. This shows that some comrades were treating the entire work process with a "completing procedures" attitude, disregarding the situation, ignoring the conditions, not considering the timing, and failing to combine the leadership's subjective ideas with the masses' demands.

Following the Crowd, Running Wild with Whatever the Masses Say

Another bad work style was extreme democracy, abandoning leadership. For example, there was a troublemaker who, since the beginning of party rectification, would curse Party members every time he saw them at meetings or on the street. When six upright Party member cadres were elected as representatives to the Farmers' Representative Conference, this person wrote "Reject" under each Party member's name on the list, and then cursed loudly, without anyone stopping him, believing this to be "democracy." In many cases, leadership was lost, and the opinions of individuals were taken as the opinions of the masses. During internal meetings of the work team, if one person initiated an opinion, other comrades with differing opinions would not argue, or would be afraid of taking responsibility, and would perfunctorily "agree" with that person's opinion, which the leadership would then consider to be the decision made by everyone at the meeting. This then transitioned from subjective imposition to tailism.

The main reason for hastiness and tailism is that the leadership (the County Party Committee and the work teams) did not treat the work with sufficient seriousness and caution. They not only lacked a sufficient understanding of the situation, but also a sufficient understanding of the policies. As Comrade Wang Xing of the County Party Committee stated in his review and summary report: "Because we did not have a sufficient understanding of the purpose, significance, and methods of party rectification, and it was not clear who we were relying on for rectification, we swayed back and forth during the movement (generally being 'left' first and then right)."

Forcing Party Members to Self-Criticize Without Giving Them a Way Out

After the work began, for a long period, party rectification was conducted behind closed doors. Gao Dian spent nineteen days rectifying behind closed doors, and Shangzheng Village spent twenty days. Some villages also sent representatives to participate in branch meetings, but the representatives were designated by the work team, had no connection with the masses, and could not play a role in mutual communication. At the branch meetings, emphasis was placed solely on "discipline" and "passing the test," uniformly applying pressure, rather than distinguishing between good and bad, and clarifying right and wrong. The Sanwang Village work team even said at the branch meeting: "You will be punished whether you repent or not." This caused Party members like Li Mingzhi to become passively resistant, no longer repent, and simply wait for punishment. On the other hand, they did not pay attention to the historical situation of the branch and the sectarian situation in the village. Even if they saw some problems, they ignored them, allowing individual revenge-seekers to ridicule Party members and undermine morale. Some were not allowed to defend themselves, and even if the opinions raised by others were inaccurate, they were forced to accept them. As a result, most of the masses were confused, and some good Party members were not allowed to join the Farmers' Association. Some Party members' wives wanted divorces, and the masses were afraid that these Party members would be detained or taken away, and some opinions were not dared to be raised. Many ordinary people even thought that joining the Party was not a good thing, saying: "How did these good children get into that (referring to the Party)?" Most Party members were also very dissatisfied, and some regretted joining the Party. According to Comrade Wang Xing's report: "Generally speaking, all the Party members were made to repent until they were pale and thin, and their morale was very low." The most serious thing was that some Party members even committed suicide out of panic. However, Comrade Wang Xing's report did not detail the circumstances of the suicides, nor did it specify how many people committed suicide. But from the lines, it can be seen that this was by no means one or two isolated incidents. And judging from this review and summary report, the Shahe County Party Committee still did not recognize the seriousness of this issue sufficiently, only mixing such a clause into some other unimportant issues in the dozen or so "residual problems in the reorganization": "It is greatly wrong for people to die." There are three lessons: "First, sectarian revenge; second, corruption problems were exposed; third, hardliners were afraid of losing face and unwilling to confess. In short, these problems occurred because we did not have enough understanding of each person's personality and the situation in the village...." This self-criticism is very insufficient, pushing the responsibility onto the "personality" of those forced to death, and onto "sectarian" and "corruption" issues, as if the leadership did not have much responsibility, which is by no means in line with reality. In addition, there is another clause in the "residual problems": "The currently detained criminals will be transferred to the People's Court for custody." What exactly are these "criminals"? How many are there? What crimes have they committed? Why are they being detained? Why are they being transferred to the People's Court? For such a serious task and such a serious problem, it is very insufficient to simply mention it so lightly. Judging from the situation of party rectification, since the masses were not truly mobilized, and in the situation of hastiness and extreme democracy, the decisions regarding these "criminals" may have been improper in many cases. Moreover, even if they are criminals, the work team and the masses do not have the right to detain them immediately. The Shahe County Party Committee and various work teams should conduct another thorough and incisive review and correction of these two issues from the perspective of policy thinking and leadership style.

Cursing the Masses as Backward After Failing to Rectify Party Members

Such "leftism" is essentially a manifestation of rightism, a lack of trust in the masses, and a failure to rely on the masses. Therefore, in the later stage of party rectification, it naturally changed to right-leaning: still without distinguishing between importance and triviality, and without distinguishing between right and wrong, even Party members with major mistakes were not given punishments based on their circumstances. Some were afraid that Party members would not be able to participate in the new Farmers' Association, were afraid of retaliation from the masses, and were afraid of not passing the review. The work teams in some villages even forced bad Party members to join the new Farmers' Association immediately (for example, Baicuo Village forced five relatively bad Party members to join together). When reviewing Party members in villages such as Gao Dian and Xinzhang, some Party members did not pass the review among the masses, but instead of conducting more in-depth repentance, they repeatedly tried to "pass" five or six times in a row. When the representatives of the Farmers' Representative Conference were not elected in Shangzheng Village for the first time, the work team used various methods to imply that they should be re-elected, and that Party members should be elected. As a result, again, Party members, regardless of whether they were good or bad, were elected by a large margin of 80 or 90 percent. After the Farmers' Representative Conference was established, the masses became passive and dissatisfied. On the Party member side, many did not achieve the goal of being educated and transformed by the masses. At first, they were only subjected to pressure from the work team, and as soon as the pressure was released, they reverted to their original state. After the bad Party members returned to power, the old work style was immediately revived. For example, in Shangguan Village, some cadres again cursed the masses as "backward" and advocated "a fine of half a catty of oil for not attending meetings," etc. This created many detours: those bad Party members who entered the Farmers' Association had to be re-examined, those who were elected as representatives to the Farmers' Representative Conference had to undergo a third election, and the bad Party members who had already occupied leading positions had to be removed from power again through the masses. The relationship between the Party and the masses was not close, but was further away than in the past, requiring further improvement, and further improvement would require even greater effort. Improper punishments of Party members also had to be re-decided...

The result of such party rectification also affected the morale of some staff members. Some were bedridden, some cried bitterly, and some asked to go home, saying: "Better to lie down than be overthrown." This sentiment is certainly wrong, and it is not enough for the County Party Committee and the work team leaders to only say that these staff members "still have remnants of major sectarian thinking" in their self-criticism. When so many serious biases arise in the party rectification work, it is inevitable that the staff members will have bad emotions, and the County Party Committee should also conduct another review of its leadership thinking and leadership style.

### 没有严肃执行整党政策　沙河县委检讨不深刻  随便扣人逼死人犯有原则错误

　　没有严肃执行整党政策
  　沙河县委检讨不深刻
    随便扣人逼死人犯有原则错误
    不管群众要求自己主观一套
    【本报消息】沙河县委和土改工作队长于本月八日召开联席会议，把一个半月以来该县三十二个村的民主整党填补工作作了一次检查。检查结果，他们认为新的作风已在开始生长，工作人员开始学会联系群众、及时搜集反映，看群众情绪及要求来进行工作；有些工作组还不断检讨工作，有问题及时开会研究，积极想解决的办法，发挥了集体领导作用。在整党方面也有成绩，如尚贤村农会主任由消极抵抗、不工作、不反省已转变为十分积极负责。但在另一方面，也还有相当严重的缺点；除县委本身检讨外，在工作组的作风上，主要的是犯了急性病。如白错村第二榜划完阶级后，工作组产生一种“赶三榜”思想，条件还未成熟就进行选举农代会；上郑村、中关村工作组听到南高成立了农代会，就连阶级也没划，不管群众觉悟如何，也没好好酝酿，主观的给群众讲了“三个条件”，就叫选举；结果选出的都是一伙老汉老娘们（最年轻的四十五岁），而且其中没一个党员。这说明有些同志是用“办手续”的态度对待整个工作步骤的，不管情况，不问条件，不看火候，领导上主观一套，和群众要求结合不起来。
    群众说啥是啥自己跟着乱跑
    另外，还有一种坏作风是极端民主，放弃领导。如有一个捣乱分子，自整党以来，每次会上或街上见了党员就大骂；有六个正派的党员干部当选了农代会代表，这个人就在榜上每个党员名字下面写上个“不要”，而且又大骂一阵，也没人挡，认为这就是“民主”。有好多事都是失掉领导的，把个别人的意见当成群众的意见。在工作组内部开会时，一个人打头炮说个意见，别的同志有不同意见也不争论，或者怕负责任，便马马虎虎“同意”这一个人的意见，领导上也就认为这就算大家开会决定的意见了。这又由主观包办变成尾巴主义。
    急性病和尾巴主义产生的原因，最主要的是领导上（县委与工作组）对待工作的态度不够十分严肃、十分慎重；不只是对情况了解得不够，对政策也了解得不够。正如该县县委王兴同志在检查总结的报导中所说：由于我们对整党的目的、意义、方法认识不够，依靠谁来整也不明确，所以在运动中表现了左右摇摆（大体上是先“左”后右）。
    不给指出出路硬逼党员反省
    开始工作后，一个长时期都是关门整党，高店关门一整十九天，上郑村二十天。有的村也派代表参加了支部会，但代表是由工作组指定的，跟群众没有联系，不能起互相通气的作用。在支部会上，则又单纯强调“纪律”，强调“过关”，一律大施压力，而不是区别好坏，分清是非。三王村工作组竟在支部会上说：“反省了也处分，不反省也要处分。”使得李明之等党员都消极抵抗起来，不再反省，单等处分。另一方面，对支部历史情况与村里宗派情况不注意，看到了一些也不管，任凭个别报复分子耻笑党员，打击情绪；还有的不让党员申辩，有人提的意见不确实也硬叫接受下来。这样搞的结果，弄得大部分群众莫明其妙，有一些好党员，群众也不敢吸收他们进农会，有的党员老婆要离婚，群众还害怕会把这些党员扣起来或带走，有些意见也不敢提了。甚至于弄得很多老百姓以为参加了党不好，说：“这伙好孩子怎么在了那个（指党）？”党员大都也很不满，有的后悔不该入党。根据王兴同志的报导：“一般化的使党员都反省得面黄肌瘦，情绪十分低落。”最严重的是还有些党员竟至恐慌自杀。但在王兴同志的报导中没有详述自杀的情形，也没说明到底有多少人自杀；但从字里行间可以看出，这决不是一两起个别的现象。而就这个检查总结的报导看，沙河县委对这问题的严重性认识得仍然很不够，只在十几条“整编当中的遗留问题”的一些其他不很重要的问题中，掺杂着这么一条：“死人问题一直下去是大大不对”，教训有三：“一是闹宗派报复；二是腐化问题被揭发后，三是硬骨头怕丢人，不愿坦白。总之，对每个人的性格，对村的情况了解不够，而发生了这些问题……。”这检讨是十分不够的，把责任推到被逼死的人自己的“性格”，推到“宗派”，“腐化”问题上，好象领导上可以不负多大责任，这无论如何是不合乎实际的。另外，在“遗留问题”中还有一条：“现扣的犯罪分子，移交人民法庭管押。”到底都是些什么“犯罪分子”？有多少？都犯的什么罪？为什么要扣押？为什么要移交人民法庭？对于这样严肃的一件工作，这么严重的一个问题，只轻轻提到这么一句也是非常不够的。就整党的情形看，既没有真正发动群众，在急性病与极端民主的情形下，这些“犯罪分子”的决定可能还有不少失当的；而且，即使是犯罪分子，工作组和群众也都没有立即扣起来的权利。沙河县委及各工作组应该再专就这两个问题从政策思想和领导作风上加以痛切彻底的检查、纠正。
    党员没有整好又骂群众落后
    这样的“左”，实质上是右的表现，是不相信群众，不依靠群众；所以到整党的后一段，就自然一变而为右倾：依然是不分轻重，不辨是非，对错误大的党员也不分别情形给以处分。还有的光怕党员参加不了新农会，光怕群众报复，怕审查时通不过；有些村的工作组就硬叫坏党员也立即入了新农会（如白错村就叫五个较坏的党员一齐参加了），高店、新章等村审查党员时，有几个党员在群众中通不过了也不再更多深入反省，便接二连三、五次六次一直要“通”。上郑村第一次选农代会代表没选上党员，工作组就硬用种种办法暗示叫重选，叫选党员，结果则又是党员不分好坏，一下子十分之八、九都当选了。而到农代会产生后，群众就消极不满起来。在党员方面，有很多没有达到被群众教育改造的目的；最初只是受到工作组的压力，压力一放松，就恢复了原样。坏党员重新上台后，旧作风也就马上复活；如上关村就有干部又骂群众“落后”，主张“开会不到罚油半斤”等。这样，也就制造了不少弯路：坏党员进了农会的要进行复审，选成农代会代表的要来一个第三次选举，已占了领导地位的坏党员，还要通过群众再搬下台来；党群关系没有密切，反而比过去距离更远，更得想法改善，而且再要改善要费更大的力气。党员处分的不适当，也还要重新决定………。
    这样整党的结果，还影响了一些工作人员的情绪，有的卧床不起，有的痛哭流涕，有的要求回家，说：“打倒不如躺倒”。这情绪当然是不对的，而在县委和工作队长的检讨中，只说这是因为这些工作人员“仍有大宗派思想的残余”是不够的。在整党工作弄出那么多严重偏向的时候，工作人员有不好的情绪也是难免的，县委也还应该从领导思想、领导作风上再作检查。
