Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 6th. The spring plowing movement in Yihe and Yanjia Chuan districts of Suide County, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has gradually unfolded. Yihe Town and Huangjia Chuan have planted 164 hectares of spring wheat and peas, which will be completed within a few days. Many farmers have begun to plant spring vegetables. Difficulties such as food and livestock shortages caused by the Chiang Kai-shek disaster have gradually been resolved through the joint efforts of the masses. For example, in the second township of Yanjia Chuan District, there were 78 head of draught animals before the war last year. Forty-two head were looted by the enemy, and 25 head have now been purchased, restoring 80 percent of the number of livestock before the war. Huangjia Chuan and other villages have restored the original number of livestock before the war. For those who have real difficulties with rations, the farmers' association will provide relief from grain reserves. In general, the masses in the village will adjust through borrowing. The "leftist" deviations committed in the land reform last winter have been basically corrected, the concerns of middle peasants and new rich peasants have been eliminated, and the enthusiasm for production has been greatly increased. However, there are still problems in the spring plowing leadership in the Yi and Yan districts. Some comrades in the work team have prolonged the time due to their lack of determination in correcting deviations, and have failed to seize the leadership of spring plowing in a timely manner. Local district and township cadres, in addition to individual cases of coercion, are either busy with other temporary work, or take a passive attitude towards spring plowing, using the excuse that the masses can produce on their own and do not need leadership, or they believe that there are too many difficulties in the village and there is no way to solve them. As a result, a laissez-faire tendency has formed in the spring plowing leadership. Therefore, some villages have not adjusted food and seeds in time, and those without labor or families in difficulty have not been quickly resolved. The education and supervision of idlers have not been tightened up. The leadership has now proposed that the urgent task at present is to strengthen the leadership of spring plowing, resolutely stop all unnecessary mobilizations, and postpone things that can be postponed as much as possible, concentrating efforts on leading spring plowing. In terms of leadership style, it is necessary to go deep into the countryside to understand the situation, discover problems, and mobilize the masses to find solutions together.

　　绥德义延两区加强春耕领导
    【新华社西北六日电】陕甘宁边区绥德县义合、延家川两区春耕运动已逐渐展开，义合镇及黄家川已种春麦及豌豆一百六十四垧，日内即可全部种完，许多农户已纷纷开始种春菜。蒋灾造成的缺粮缺牲畜等困难，在群众共同努力下已逐渐解决。如延家川区二乡在去年战争以前共有耕畜七十八头，被敌掠走四十二头，现已买进二十五头，恢复至战前牲畜数的百分之八十。黄家川等村已恢复战前牲畜的原有数。口粮问题实在困难的由农会存粮救济，一般的则由本村群众以借贷方式调剂。去冬土改中所犯“左”的偏向已基本上纠正，中农和新富农的顾虑已经消除，并大大提高了生产情绪。但义、延两区春耕领导尚有问题。有的工作组同志由于纠偏不坚决拖长了时间，未能及时抓紧对春耕的领导。地方区乡干部除个别发现强迫命令现象外，有的忙于其他的临时工作，有的对春耕采取消极态度，借口说群众自己会生产，用不着领导，有的则认为村中困难多没办法，以致形成春耕领导中自流放任的偏向，因此有些村子吃粮种籽未及调剂，无劳动力或家庭困难的未迅速解决，对二流子未抓紧教育督促生产。领导上现已提出，当前的紧急任务是加强春耕领导，坚决制止一切不必要的动员，可以缓办的事情尽量缓办，集中力量领导春耕。在领导作风上要深入农村了解情况发现问题，发动群众大家想办法。
