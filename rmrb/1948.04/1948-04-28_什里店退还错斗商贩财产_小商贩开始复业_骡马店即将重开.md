    [This report] (From our correspondent) In Wu'an's Ninth District, Shili Village is correctly implementing the policy on industry and commerce, returning illegally confiscated property to merchants, boosting the morale of the vendors, and accelerating their return to business. Last year, during the campaign to cut off "feudal tails," some merchants were wrongly targeted due to errors in class designation and a lack of understanding of the policy on industry and commerce. Li Shengjiang's bicycle and 100,000 Jiao of Hebei currency, Wang Zichun and Fu Zhengyu's two noodle-pressing machines in their small restaurant, and Wang Chonglu's Luoma Inn were all confiscated and turned over to the public. After fifty days of Party rectification this year and the correct dissemination and implementation of the Land Law, the political consciousness of village cadres and the masses has greatly improved. They realized that struggling against merchants was a fundamental violation of the Party's policy on industry and commerce, and also extremely detrimental to their own economic lives. In mid-April, the village government and the peasant representative assembly formally resolved to return all the aforementioned merchants' property to their original owners. The masses all said: "It was wrong to attack those engaged in trade. Now, cloth is so cheap here, and dye is more expensive than cloth, just because there are too few traders, and they can't bring cloth out in large quantities and bring dye in from outside." After the wrongly targeted merchants got back their means of production, they have begun to actively resume business. Li Shengjiang has already traded straw hats once and has now gone to Wu'an City to trade again. The masses all say that he is a "good worker, who earns the equivalent of two middle peasants' income in a year." Wang Chonglu, who is over seventy years old, immediately began to tidy up his Luoma Inn. Within three days, he had plastered the stove, tidied up the stable, repaired the edges of the kang in the guest rooms, and even set out the lamp oil pot, preparing to open on the 19th day of the third lunar month. He stroked his white beard on the street and said to people: "If an old sow gives birth to piglets, it's worth celebrating as long as it's alive. Although I'm old, I still want to work hard. There are five people in my family. I'll make noodles, my women will tend the fire, and the children will greet guests and take care of the livestock. We can definitely manage it." When he talked about how he used to make a net profit of five or six ten thousand yuan in silver dollars a month, he kept saying, "The heartache of two years is gone, gone!"

    什里店退还错斗商贩财产
    小商贩开始复业
    骡马店即将重开
    【本报消息】武安九区什里店正确执行工商业政策，退还错斗商贩财产，各商贩生产情绪提高，迅速复业。该村去年割“封建尾巴”时，因为划阶级的错误和对工商业政策不了解，错斗了一些商贩。李声江的自行车一辆和冀钞十万元，王子春、傅正玉的小饭铺里压面机两架，王重禄的骡马店一座，都没收归公了。经过今年五十天的整党与对土地法的正确宣传与执行，村干部和群众政治觉悟大大提高，认识到斗争商贩是根本违反党的工商业政策，也是对自己经济生活十分不利的。本月中旬，乃经村政府与农代会正式决议，将上述商贩财物全部退还原主。群众都说：“就是不该打击作买卖的。现在咱这里布这样贱，染料比布还贵，就因为买卖人少，不能大量的把布带到外边去，把外边的染料带进来。”错斗的商贩拿回自己生产资本后，现已开始积极恢复营业。李声江已贩了草帽一次，现又去武安城贩货去了，群众都说他是“好干家，一年下来，两个中农时光也挣了”。七十多岁的王重禄，马上开始收拾他的骡马店，三天之内，就把炉灶泥好，马房打整好，客房里的炕沿也重修一遍，连灯油壶也摆好了，准备阴历三月十九开张。他在街上翘起白胡子对人说：“老母猪生猪娃，活着就算，我虽老了，还要好好干，我一家五口，我拉面，娘儿们掌火，孩子招呼客人和牲口，满能行啦”。他谈起往年每月能净赚洋五、六万元时，不断说：“两年的心病去啦，去啦”！
