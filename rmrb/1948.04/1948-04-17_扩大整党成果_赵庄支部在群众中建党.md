　　Expanding the Achievements of Party Rectification
  　Zhao Village Branch Builds the Party Among the Masses

　　I. Consolidating the Achievements of Party Rectification

　　When Zhao Village concluded its Party rectification at the end of March, a common problem existed among the Party members and cadres: they couldn't distinguish between their own mistakes and the mistakes that should be shared by the county and district leadership, feeling oppressed and hindering complete ideological awareness. Party member Jin Heliang said: "It's my own fault for taking the fruits of struggle, no argument there! But there are two things I can't figure out. I and Li Wenke led the work of eliminating traitors, which was assigned by the higher-ups. The higher-ups kept saying the struggle wasn't thorough enough, and as a result, middle peasants were struggled against! Now we have to take all the blame ourselves, or we can't pass the test!" Jin Qiufu said: "The higher-ups kept calling for digging out small roots, removing boundary stones, and uprooting Chiang sprouts. After digging and uprooting, the middle peasants were wrongly struggled against. It's nothing if I make mistakes myself, but even the women in my family have committed crimes, and they're not even called to meetings!"... In light of these circumstances, the work team decided to hold a branch meeting before formally discussing Party building, allowing Party members and cadres to raise opinions about the leadership and further improve the ideological awareness of Party members and the masses by examining the leadership and policies, consolidating the achievements of Party rectification, and laying the foundation for Party building work. At the meeting, Party members freely vented some of the pent-up feelings since the Party rectification, and all appeared relaxed and happy. Party member Zhao Xi said: "This is truly like a mute dreaming of his mother, there's a place to pour out my heart!" This allowed each Party member and cadre to consider from a comprehensive perspective, which of the things they had done in the past were for the public good and which were for personal gain? Which were their own mistakes and which should be the responsibility of the higher-ups? Therefore, their phrasing and conclusions on various issues gradually became more correct. For example, they said: "The county and district leadership should bear the main responsibility for wrongly struggling against middle peasants (out of the eighty-one households wrongly struggled against in Zhao Village, except for two cases where district cadre Zhao Wenbin used personal revenge, the rest were decided by the district)." "But we can't blame the higher-ups for occupying more fruits and oppressing the masses, it's mainly because our thinking is not correct!" They said: "The meeting in Guzhen District in the winter before last, Comrade Ding said it very clearly. He said: 'Jin Ming, now that your life is better, you should help the poor brothers who haven't turned themselves over yet to do so, don't divide the fruits again.' I said: 'That's right, but when we came back to divide the fruits, we only complained that we didn't get enough, who can we blame for this mistake? We can only blame ourselves!'" They also deeply felt from the process of policy examination and distinguishing right from wrong that the Party's love for them and the greatness of the Party rectification policy. Party member Li Hui, who had extremely poor relations with the masses in the past, said: "This Party rectification by the higher-ups is really right, it would have been good if it had been done two years earlier, it would be impossible to clean up if it was any later!" Party member Jin Ming said: "The Party is even closer than my own parents. When I was begging in the past, my parents only gave me a bowl and told me to eat my fill, but the Party not only helped me turn myself over, but also led me onto the right path." Xue Shuangsuo said: "The higher-ups are like our own fathers, seeing that we have shortcomings and don't listen to them, they give us two slaps to correct us, but they still love us in their hearts!" They also proved from their own experience that the work team's consistent implementation of the policy of being both strict and pointing out a way out during the Party rectification was very correct.

　　II. Establishing the Ideology of the Party Constitution and Party Program

　　After examining the leadership, examining the policies, and clearing their minds, the content of the branch meeting turned to clearing up each Party member's motives for joining the Party and establishing the ideology of the Party Constitution and Party Program, striving to establish a sound rural branch life.

　　When clearing up the motives for joining the Party, old Party member Jin Caiyuan said that when he joined the Party, he only remembered Yang Ziping saying: "Join the Communist Party to strive for a future position, to be able to speak." Later, when recruiting Party members, it was all the same. Some Party members even felt that: "Being a Party member means having two heads, not being afraid of making mistakes, turning big things into small things, and small things into nothing." In short, "vaguely feeling that the Communist Party is good, joining only has benefits and no harm." A few people vaguely knew that "they should serve the masses," but most people didn't even have this idea. Moreover, because they lacked long-term education after being recruited into the Party (meetings only discussed administrative tasks, and there was no inspection or summary after assigning work), the level was generally very low, and they didn't even understand the basic knowledge such as the rights and obligations of Party members. Therefore, the comrades of the work team combined their motives for joining the Party with the problems in Party life, and conducted two educations on the Party Constitution and Party Program, so that everyone realized that a Communist Party member is the vanguard of the proletariat, and in order to liberate the majority of people, he can sacrifice everything to advance society and serve the masses to the end. The Party members all said: "This is the first lesson since joining the Party, which has enlightened my mind." In order to improve the level of Party members and improve the branch life, the comrades of the work team announced that anyone who felt that they were not good enough or unwilling to make progress could withdraw from the Party or automatically downgrade to probationary Party members, and they nominated six Party members who were usually more backward and solicited their opinions. This caused a great shock to these six comrades and other comrades, who felt that being a Communist Party member was really not simple. They proposed "insisting on not withdrawing from the Party"! Zhao Shunxing, who was nominated, said very sadly: "Based on my self-reflection, my attitude and behavior are not good, which is detrimental to the Party. If it is because of me that the masses oppose our Party, I am willing to withdraw, but, according to my own heart, I still want to make progress!" Jin Suode (former chairman of the farmers' association), a Party member who had not reflected well at the meeting, made a self-reflection report. Everyone automatically stipulated that the first and fifteenth of each month would be Party Days, and each group bought two copies of the Party Constitution, and proposed: "From now on, we must act in accordance with the Party Constitution."

　　III. The Masses Discuss Party Building

　　In addition to the branch meeting, representatives of the masses participated, and Party building was also widely discussed among the masses. The questions raised by each farmer representative group and joint group were roughly three: First, why did the Zhao Village Party have so many problems in the past? Second, what are your hopes for the Zhao Village Party? Therefore, third, who would you like to recommend to the Communist Party to lead you?

　　The masses discussed these issues very seriously and individually, and the conclusions reached were: "The Zhao Village Party had problems in the past, mainly because there was no democracy, and the masses could not give opinions to the Party members, often washing their faces for them"; "From now on, Party members should frequently solicit the opinions of the masses, often wash their faces, and also expand the Communist Party, more people means more ideas, so they can lead well." Therefore, each street, group, and individual recommended the people they loved and hoped that the Communist Party would absorb them as Party members. A total of 131 people were recommended by 42 representative groups in each street (20 of them were mentioned by almost every street). The conditions of these people were: able to endure hardship and stand hard work, able to play a leading role in the masses, able to accept the opinions of the masses, able to speak the truth, etc. Those who did not meet the conditions or whose conditions were slightly worse were criticized or debated.

　　When the masses in the fifth street recommended new Party members, someone proposed Zhao Xicai. Zhao Xicai stood up and introduced himself, saying: "When the Eighth Route Army came, I also participated in that movement, but..." The new middle peasant Li Jingen immediately stood up and said: "I don't agree with Zhao Xicai joining the Party." When asked why, he said: "I won't say, let him be self-aware!" (Referring to Zhao having the shortcoming of "not being able to eat his fill.") When Li Genshan was mentioned, someone immediately objected, saying: "He didn't work properly in the army, he went home without a discharge certificate, and this time he is returning houses and land to avoid returning to the team." Li Genshan also said shamefully: "I don't touch it"! When someone from the third street recommended the upright farmer Jin Chunshan, someone asked: "He is honest and loyal, and has been working all year round, but he is silent, he can't be a Party member!" It can be seen that the masses are very strict about the conditions of Party members.

　　IV. Expanding the Party's Ranks

　　After the masses recommended, the Party discussed, and finally decided to absorb 24 people, all of whom were honest, upright, well-aware, and enthusiastic to work for everyone's benefit, including poor and hired peasants, new middle peasants, women, and youths.

　　On April 10th, the branch meeting carefully studied the development targets. That night and the next morning, the Party members went to talk to them individually. A Party member went to develop the young laborer Yang Xiangbao, who was walking to the field, and followed him all the way talking. Yang Xiangbao said: "What do I feel? The Communist Party leads well, what don't I know? Everyone thinks highly of me and asks me to join the Party, but I haven't contributed any effort, I haven't taken a single difficult step and I'm already in the Party, I'm afraid I don't meet the conditions!?" Another Party member went to develop the poor woman Ren Gai, who said: "I am very satisfied, I just lived through the time of the Eighth Route Army, I am determined to do it, I am not afraid of hardship, I am satisfied to be in Chairman Mao's Party to serve the masses." Zhao Quanxi, a member of the farmers' association, said to the Party member who came to talk to him: "I have been looking forward to this matter for a long time, even if I have to sacrifice everything, I will do it." The prestige of the Party has been greatly enhanced among the masses and Party members.

### 扩大整党成果　赵庄支部在群众中建党

　　扩大整党成果
  　赵庄支部在群众中建党
    一、巩固整党成果
    赵庄村三月底结束整党时，党员干部思想上普遍存在着一个问题，就是自己的错误与县区领导上应该分担的错误分不清，感到受压抑，妨碍了思想的完全自觉。党员靳河良说：“拿斗争果实是咱自己的错误，没有话说！就是有两宗事情想不通，俺和李文科领导锄奸工作，是上级布置的；上级一直说斗争不彻底不彻底，结果把中农斗争了！这次全得揽到自己身上，不揽过不了关！”靳秋福说：“上级一直号召刨小根、拔界石、扣蒋芽，刨来刨去把中农斗错了，自己犯错误也没啥，连家里娘们都犯了罪啦，开会弄啥也不叫去！”………根据这些情况，工作组决定在正式讨论建党前，首先召开一次支部会，让党员干部对领导上提意见，并从检查领导检查政策中，进一步提高党员群众的思想觉悟，巩固整党成果，为建党工作打下基础。会议上，党员由于自由倾吐了整党以来的一些积郁，都表现得轻松愉快起来。党员赵锡说：“这真是哑巴梦着娘，有话也有处诉说啦！”这样，使每个党员干部都能从全面情况出发，考虑自己过去所办哪些事为公，哪些事为私？哪些是自己的错误，哪些是上级要负责。因此他们对各项问题的提法与结论都渐趋正确。如说：“斗争错中农，县区领导上要负主要责任（赵庄错斗的八十一户中，除两户是区干部赵文斌个人夹私报复外，其余都是区上决定的）。可是多占果实压迫群众就不能怨上级了，主要是咱思想不正确！”如说：“前年冬天在固镇区上开会，丁同志就说得清清格格的，他说：靳明的你的生活过好了，就该帮助没翻透身的穷弟兄翻身，不要再分果实了。俺说：可就是，回来分果实，却光嫌分得少了，这错误能怨谁？只怪咱自己！”他们并从政策检查明辨是非过程中，深深感到党对自己的热爱与整党政策的伟大，过去群众关系极坏的党员李会的说：“上级这次整党，真对，要早两年就好了，迟了就没办法收拾了！”党员靳明的说：“党比俺亲爹娘还亲，俺过去要饭，爹娘只给俺一个碗叫要饱饭吃，党不光叫俺翻了身，还领俺往正道上走。”薛双锁说：“上级好比亲老子，看见俺们有不是，又不听话，乒乓两巴掌叫俺改正过来，心肝眼里还是疼咱！”他们并从自己体验中证明这次工作组在整党中，始终贯彻既严正而又指出出路的方针是十分正确的。
    二、树立党纲党章思想
    检查领导、检查政策，清醒头脑之后，支部会的内容即转向清算每个党员的入党动机，树立党纲、党章思想，为建立一个健全的农村支部生活而努力。
    在清算入党动机时，老党员靳才垣说，他入党时，光记得杨子平说：“参加共产党争取前途地位，能说话”。以后吸收党员时，都是这一套，甚至有的党员还觉得：“在了党员长两个头，犯错误也不怕，大事化小事，小事化无事”。总之，“糊涂觉得共产党好，加入只有利没有坏处”。少数人还笼统知道“要为群众服务”，多数人连这点思想也没有。并且由于他们被吸收入党后，长期缺乏教育（开会只讨论些行政任务，布置下工作也不检查也不总结），水准一般很低，连党员的权利与义务等起码知识都不懂。因此，工作组同志便结合他们的入党动机，以及党内生活中的问题，进行了两次党纲党章的教育，使大家认识到共产党员是无产阶级的先锋队，为了多数人的翻身解放，他可以不惜牺牲自己的一切，把社会推向前进，为群众服务到底。党员都说：“这是入党以来第一课，使自己思想开了一窍”。并为了提高党员的水平、健全支部生活，这时工作组同志宣布了一件事，说谁如果觉得自己不行，也不愿意进步，谁愿意退党可以退党，或者自动降为候补党员，并提出六个平常比较落后的党员，征求他们的意见，引起这六位同志以及其他同志很大的震动，觉得当一个共产党员实在不简单，他们提出“坚持不退党”！被提名的赵顺兴很沉痛的说：“根据我的反省态度行为表现不好，对党不利，要是因为我一个人叫群众反对咱党，叫我退我情愿退，不过啊，按我自己的心事，我还想进步，进步！”会上没有反省好的党员靳锁的（旧农会主任）作了一次反省报告，大家自动规定每月初一、十五为党日，每个小组并买了两本党章，并提出：“从今往后，一定要按党章办事”。
    三、群众讨论建党
    除支部会群众派代表参加外，同时，并在群众中广泛的讨论建党，各农代小组及联合组所提的问题大概有三：第一、为什么过去赵庄党还有许多毛病？第二、你自己对赵庄党有什么希望？因此，第三，你愿意介绍哪些人到共产党里边领导你们？
    对这些问题，群众都很认真的逐个加以讨论，所得出的结论是：“赵庄党员过去有毛病，主要是没有民主，群众不能给党员们提意见，经常给他们洗脸”；“从今往后党员要勤征求群众们意见，常常洗脸，再就是要扩大共产党，人多主意多，就能领导好。”因此，各街各组各人，都纷纷把自己所爱戴的人推荐出来，希望共产党吸收他们为党员。经各街四十二个代表小组推荐出来的人共一百三十一名（其中有二十个人几乎各街都提到他们），这些人的条件是：能吃苦耐劳、能在群众中间起模范带头作用、能接受群众意见、能说直理等等，对那些不够条件或条件稍差的人，都进行了批评或争论。
    五街群众推荐新党员推荐到最后，有人提出赵喜才，赵喜才站起来自我介绍说：“八路军一来，那个运动我也参加，不过…………”新中农李金根马上站起来说：“赵喜才参加党，我不同意。”旁人问为什么？他说：“我也不说，叫他自觉吧！”（意指赵有“吃不饱”的缺点。）当提到李根山时，马上就有人反对说：“他在队伍上不正干，没有退伍证就回家，这回退房退地是为了不归队。”李根山也羞愧地说：“咱不沾”！三街有人推荐正派农民靳春山时，有人问道：“人倒是老实忠厚，长年劳动，就是个不吭气，当党员不行！”可见群众对党员的条件看得很严格。
    四、扩大党的队伍
    经过群众推荐，党内讨论，最后决定吸收二十四个人，全是一伙“拿到那里都能敲得当当响”的老实正派、认识好、热心为大家办事的贫雇农、新中农、妇女和青年。
    四月十号支部会审慎研究发展对象，当天晚上，第二天早上，党员即分头去和他们个别谈话，一个党员去发展劳动青年杨相保，他正往地里走，便随着他一路走一路谈，杨相保说：“有啥感觉哩？共产党领导好，我啥不清楚？大家看得起才叫我在党，我就是出力也没出过力，难路还没有走一步就在了党，怕不够条件！？”另一个党员去发展贫苦妇女任改的，她说：“我可满意，我就是过的八路军时光，干，我坚决要干，吃苦耐劳我啥也不怕，在了毛主席党给群众服务，我满意。”农会委员赵全喜向找他讲话的党员说：“这个事，我就早盼着，就是要我牺牲一切，我也要干。”党的威信，在群众中，党员中，是大大提高了。
