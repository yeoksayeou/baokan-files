　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Moscow Radio broadcast on March 28th a commentary by Marcius on the US imperialist Senate Foreign Relations Committee passing a bill to continue military aid to Chiang. It began by stating: The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a bill on March 22nd to aid Chiang with $463 million, of which $363 million is under the guise of so-called economic aid, continuing the Chinese civil war under the Marshall Plan, and $100 million allows Chiang Kai-shek to purchase military equipment and supplies at will to carry out counter-revolutionary civil war. (Note: The US imperialist military aid to Chiang bill, passed by the US House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 19th, amounted to $570 million, $107 million more than the figure passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The final figure will be decided by a joint conference of the two houses around April 10th). The chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, reactionary ringleader Vandenberg, said: When the bill is implemented, China (Chiang bandits) should undertake the "obligations" stipulated by the Marshall Plan and sign an agreement with the United States. These "obligations" will stipulate that all levels of government agencies in China (referring to the Chiang area) and the supervision rights over domestic and foreign trade, industry, agriculture, and finance will be completely handed over to the United States, and the US government will appoint privileged commissioners to implement this supervision.
    The commentary continued: The great counter-offensive of the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the past nine months has now entered a new stage. Its characteristics are manifested in the fact that the People's Liberation Army has begun to seize large strongholds and industrial centers. Chiang Kai-shek's implementation of the US imperialist Wedemeyer's military plan of August last year—assigning a group of US imperialist military advisers to directly participate in the work of the Kuomintang "Ministry of National Defense," stipulating that they should maintain strongholds in Manchuria and other areas at any cost, and consolidate the rear of the Kuomintang army, buy time to train new troops, and then attack the liberated areas—this plan went bankrupt even before the US Congress had finished discussing the military aid to Chiang bill. The main transportation lines guarded by the Kuomintang army have been cut off in many places or completely occupied by the People's Liberation Army, and important Kuomintang strongholds such as Jilin, Sipingjie, and Yichuan have been lost one after another.
    The commentary concluded: The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's spring offensive is a major blow to the US imperialist plan to aid Chiang and enslave China. This fact demonstrates that $463 million, or even ten times that amount, cannot save the Kuomintang, nor can it stop the final victory of the patriotic and democratic forces of the Chinese people.

　　解放军春季攻势进入新阶段
  　美元也救不了蒋介石
    马西努评美帝通过军事援蒋法案
    【新华社陕北二日电】莫斯科电台三月二十八日广播马西努对美帝参议院外委会通过继续军事援蒋法案的评论。首称：美参院外委会三月二十二日通过以四亿六千三百万美元援蒋，其中三亿六千三百万美元以所谓经济援助的名义根据马歇尔计划延续中国内战，一亿美元则容许蒋介石随意购买军火及军用物资进行反革命内战。（按：美帝军事援蒋法案，美众院外委会三月十九日通过五亿七千万美元，比参院外委会所通过数字多一亿零七百万美元，其确实数字将在四月十日前后两院联席会议始作最后决定）美参院外委会主席反动派头子范登堡说：法案履行时，中国（蒋匪）应承担马歇尔计划所规定的“义务”，与美国签署协定。这些“义务”将规定中国（指蒋区）所有各级政府机关以及对内外的贸易、工业、农业、财政的监督权，完全交给美国，由美国政府委任具有特权的专员实行这种监督。
    评论中继指出：中国人民解放军九个月来的大反攻，现已进入新阶段。其特点表现在人民解放军已开始夺取大的据点和工业中心。蒋介石实行美帝魏德迈去年八月的军事计划——分派一批美帝军事顾问直接参加国民党“国防部”工作，规定不惜以任何代价保持在满洲和其他区域的据点，并巩固国民党军队的后方，争取时间训练新的部队，然后再进攻解放区——这一计划，在美国会还没有讨论完军事援蒋法案的时候就破产了。国民党军队固守的主要交通线，在许多地点被切断，或者是被人民解放军完全占领了，国民党的重要据点如吉林、四平街、宜川是接连丧失了。
    评论中最后指出：中国人民解放军春季攻势的胜利，是中国人民对美帝援蒋奴役中国计划的重大打击，这个事实在说明：四亿六千三百万美元，或者增加到这个数字的十倍，也不能拯救国民党，不能阻止中国人民爱国民主力量的最后胜利。
