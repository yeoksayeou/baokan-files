[This report] Zhangjing Village Chief Peng Baofu of PingShun County said at a cadre production research conference: “Our past style was rigid and based on administrative orders, which was wrong. Now we must implement democracy. We will do whatever the masses tell us to do, and we will not do anything if the masses don't mention it." At a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants to study production, Liu Genwang (a poor peasant) said: "The masses used to rely on cadres. Now the cadres have a big burden on their minds and don’t lead everyone in production. The masses always feel that the time is not right. When the time comes, you will be afraid of rushing, so you are not enthusiastic about production." Based on the above situation, a meeting of middle and poor peasants of the whole village was held on the night of the 22nd to study how the current production work should be carried out, and to examine the experiences and shortcomings of past mutual aid production. At the same time, the cadres also examined and reflected on their past mistakes of administrative orders, forced leadership, and the current two deviations of small hands and feet and abandoning leadership. They proposed that in the future, they should listen to everyone's opinions more, serve everyone more, and be a good hired laborer for everyone. When discussing the past rush production, everyone felt a headache. Yang Shuangzhu said: "The mutual aid group is very good, but we are afraid of rush. The crops should be harvested when they are ripe. In the past few years, in autumn and summer, regardless of whether they were ripe or not, we had to rush to complete the task within a time limit. Some grains were not ripe enough, and they could not be milled into rice, and the public grain could not be handed in, which caused great losses." Zhang Shuanggui said: "The good grain I grew last year was not ripe enough, and people insisted on rushing it. I threshed it and it could not be milled into rice. I said: Let’s rush it, but I will never grow this kind of grain next year. I will grow some coarse grain (early-maturing grain)." Liu Genwang said: "To grow crops, you must do a good job in cultivation to produce more grain. Every year we rush, just for speed, regardless of whether life is good or bad. Like last year, we hoed twice in front, and then rushed to hoe the third time. There was no grass in the field (just hoed), but they insisted on rushing to hoe it again. It wasted a lot of work and didn’t do much good. The wages for hoeing were more expensive than the value of the grain produced, which was really not worth it."

Finally, everyone studied the current preparatory work for spring ploughing and sowing, and decided to immediately carry out comprehensive repair of field edges, building embankments, and harrowing the land, and continue to complete fertilizer application, and strive to seize the time to sow acres when the sowing season arrives; and on the second night, the mutual aid groups were used as units to study and discuss and formulate a short-term spring production plan. This year, we must avoid rushing and do a good job in living and producing.

[This report] There was a lot of snow and rain in Qingcaowa Village, District 3 of Pingshun County last winter and this spring, and the soil is very good. With the arrival of Qingming, the climate in District 3 is very hot, but the village lacks labor. Except for soldiers and staff, there are actually 52 laborers (full and half). In this situation, in order to plant cotton early, the village technical committee was convened on the 24th of February (lunar calendar) to formulate a plan to combine cotton planting and wheat weeding according to different climates, and to specifically study technology and analyze problems. After discussion, everyone decided to plant all 110 mu of cotton land in the village from the 25th of February to the 2nd of March (lunar calendar), and weed 96 mu of wheat. The whole village has now completed the miscellaneous work on the edge of the fields, and hemp has been planted completely on the edges of the fields, and they are sowing cotton and weeding wheat.

　　张井村检讨纠正盲目突击
  　进行春耕要有计划
    【本报消息】平顺县张井村村长彭保富在干部研究生产会议上说：“咱们过去作风生硬行政命令，这都是不对的，现下要实行民主呢，群众叫咱们搞啥咱就搞啥，群众不提啥，咱就不搞啦。”在研究生产贫雇农座谈会上，刘根旺（贫农）说：“群众过去依靠惯干部啦，现下干部在思想上背了个大包袱，不来领导大家生产，群众总觉着还不到时候哩，到了时候你怕不突击呢，所以对于生产就不起劲儿。”根据以上情况，又于廿二日夜，召开了全村中贫农座谈会，分组研究目前的生产工作，应该怎样进行，检查过去互助生产当中经验与缺点。同时干部也在这个会议上检查反省了自己过去的行政命令，强迫领导，与现下的小手小脚放弃领导两种偏向的错误，提出今后要多接受大家意见，多为大家服务，给大家当个好长工。在讨论到过去突击生产时，大家一致感到头痛。杨双柱说：“互助组很好，咱就怕突击，庄稼该割的时候，才能割呢，前几年，一到了秋夏天，不管都熟啦没有，一律要突击，限期完成，有的谷还不熟哩，碾不成米，交不了公粮，吃了很大的亏。”张双贵说：“我去年长的好谷呀，还不熟哩，人家非叫突击不行，打下来碾不成米。我说：突击就突击吧，明年我总不种这种谷啦，要种些糙谷（早熟谷）。”刘根旺说：“种地总得做造好，才能多打粮食，年年要突击，光图快，不管生活做的好歹，象年时吧，前面耨二锄，后面就跟着突击第三锄，地里本来就没草（刚锄过），就这非叫再突击一锄不行，多误了工，不顶多大事，打了几颗粮食，都出了工资米，实在不上算。”
    最后大家又研究了目前的春耕下种的准备工作，决定要马上全面的进行修边、垒岸、打耙地，继续完成送肥，争取到了下种时期抢垧下种；并于第二天黑夜，以互助组为单位，研究讨论，订出春季生产短期计划。今年一定要避免突击，把生活要挨着板眼做好。
