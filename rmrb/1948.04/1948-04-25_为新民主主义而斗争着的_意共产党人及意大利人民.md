The situation of the Italian people is now completely different from when the Communist Party convened its Fifth Congress in 1946. At that time, we had not yet been liberated from the fascist accomplice monarchy. The events of April and May 1946 told all the Italian people how difficult it was to be liberated from these fascist remnants, and how great a price was paid to fight the monarchy. But we, together with all the democratic forces and the forces of the republicans, ultimately won the victory of the struggle. Now Italy is a democratic republic. It already has its own constitution, which, despite its negative aspects, shortcomings, and weaknesses, basically points out the path we should take, which is to carry through to the end the cause of revival that began with the founding of the republic. In January 1946, Italy was still a country occupied by foreign troops and subject to foreign administrative institutions. The signing of the peace treaty and the withdrawal of the occupying forces restored to the Italian people the conditions of a free people, which also meant that Italy had taken a big step forward.

In recent months, new forms of foreign intervention have emerged, causing increasing unease. But the blame for this lies not with the Italian people, but with the leaders of the government, who have forced Italy to act as a pawn of foreign imperialism. In terms of the recovery of the national economy, thanks to the decisive contribution of the working class, great progress has been made. However, the current unemployment situation in Italy has reached its highest point. The extremely poor living conditions of the people in major industrial cities and rural areas, especially in the south and the islands, have not improved. The hope of increasing productivity and the accompanying increase in industrialists' profits are completely incomparable to the increase in wages. Wage increases cannot keep up with the soaring prices. The selling price of agricultural products rose 36 times from 1938 to 1946, while the wages of agricultural workers increased only 26 times during the same period; the wages of industrial workers in 1945 increased six times compared to before the war, while prices rose about 30 times. The nominal wages in May 1947 increased 35 times compared to before the war, while the prices of industrial products rose 50 times during the same period. These figures show that the restoration of work in countries that allow the so-called "full freedom of productivity" has led to the deepening of class contradictions, the poverty and unemployment of the broad masses of the people, and the new decline of Italy's socio-economic situation.

Two years ago, we were still in the initial stage of restoring democratic workers' organizations. Today, the trade union movement has become a broad and unified mass movement. It includes approximately seven million industrial, agricultural, and other laborers. Cooperatives were also just beginning to be organized, but have now become a broad mass movement with millions of members. The Communist Party itself has also been consolidated and has become a great mass democratic organization with more than two million members.

In addition, it should be noted that the unity of the working class, as demonstrated in the close alliance between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party in the two-party united action agreement, is also a major achievement. This unity resolutely opposed all conspiracies and attacks, making it a pillar for defending democratic achievements.

However, there have also been many shortcomings in our political life in the past two years. The first is that the actual goals of the Italian democrats—economic and social reforms—are still far from reality. This is a major shortcoming of the Italian democrats, the National Liberation Front, and all democratic parties (including the Communist Party). The emergence of this shortcoming is due to the influence of special conditions, that is, Italy was liberated from fascism under special conditions. The new democratic countries, because the conditions by which they were liberated are very different from ours, were able to move forward so rapidly on the basis of implementing the above-mentioned socio-economic reforms. This shortcoming is reflected politically in that it has not become a politically unified democracy for a certain period of time, but has organized a government under the pressure of reactionary forces and the direct intervention of foreign imperialism. The wealthy reactionary classes were able to raise their heads because we did not fundamentally defeat their forces; they found a satisfactory basis for their development because we did not carry out a resolute struggle to eliminate all possible germs of reactionary fascist movements.

It is the responsibility of the working class and the working people to defend themselves and understand that defeating the reactionary parties' attacks. The past few months have been months of large-scale economic and political struggles. Most of these struggles were defensive in nature, but the result was that the working class and the working people won great victories. The advanced forces of the working class have also achieved political success. They forced the fascist groups to make concessions (at least temporarily). These people once thought that now was the time to launch a frantic attack on the newly restored workers' organizations.

Obviously, we are in a time of danger today, and we also feel the threat hanging over the heads of Italian democrats and the Italian people. This is not only the result of the situation that has been created in our country, but also the result of the situation that has been created throughout the world, which is a threat to Italy's independent sovereignty and the Italian people's freedom. The result of the struggles of the past few months is the awakening of the Italian people, which should become the starting point for new struggles, the starting point for organized action. New struggles and actions can remove this threat facing the Italian people. The policy of American imperialism is this threat, and its essence is fully manifested in the "Truman Doctrine."

The United States is trying to control the fate of European countries, which are now undergoing economic, and therefore also political and social, weakness. Furthermore, it should never be forgotten that there are still many countries in Europe (including Italy) that have not eliminated the roots of fascism and the traitors of the country. There are also some countries, such as Spain, where the openly existing fascist regime, under the protection of American imperialists and other imperialist powers, continues to survive and act unscrupulously. It should not be forgotten that there are also countries like Greece, whose people have made decisive contributions to the cause of fighting for independence and freedom, but have now been driven back into the abyss of fascism as a result of the intervention of imperialist powers—initially Britain, and later the United States. On the one hand, there are imperialist forces that are establishing a bloc that is trying to realize the illusion of world domination, and therefore they will not hesitate to destroy the independence, peace, and tranquility of various countries. On the other hand, there is the force of peace—the socialist countries, which have tested their strength, perseverance, close unity, and indestructible socialist system in the war. Together with the socialist countries, other European countries have successfully implemented the new democratic system and have formed a new unity of people's power to establish a society that will develop towards socialism.

### 为新民主主义而斗争着的　意共产党人及意大利人民

　　为新民主主义而斗争着的
  　意共产党人及意大利人民
    （意共总书记托格里亚蒂今年一月在意共第六次代表大会上的报告）
    意大利人民的处境已经与一九四六年共产党召开五次代表大会时截然不同了。那时候我们还没有从法西斯主义的帮手君主制度之下解放出来。一九四六年四月及五月的事件告诉全意大利人民，从这些法西斯余孽下解放是如何困难，及与君主制度作斗争曾付出了如何巨大的代价。但我们与一切民主力量及共和主义者的力量一起，毕竟赢得了斗争的胜利。现在意大利已经是一个民主共和国了。它已经有了自己的宪法，尽管还有着它消极的方面、缺陷和弱点，但它基本上指出了我们应走的道路，就是将由共和国成立时就开始的复兴事业进行到底。一九四六年一月，意大利还是被外国军队占领及受外国行政机构管制的国家。和平条约的签定及占领军的撤退，使意大利人民又重新获得了自由人民的条件，这也意味着意大利已前进了一大步。
    近几个月来又出现了新式的外国干涉，因而引起了愈来愈大的不安。但这件事的罪过不在意大利人民，而在政府领导者身上，他们迫使意国充当外国帝国主义的走卒。在国家经济的恢复方面，由于劳动阶级的具有决定性的贡献，已有巨大进步，然而目前意大利的失业情形却达到了最高点。各大工业城市及乡村中，尤其是南方及各岛屿上人民极坏的生活条件没有改善。希望提高生产力及随之而来的工业家所得利润的增加与工资的增加，完全不能同日而语。工资的提高绝不能适应物价的飞腾。农业品的售价由一九三八年至一九四六年上涨了三十六倍，而农业工人的工资在同一时期中仅增加了二十六倍；工业工人的工资一九四五年较战前增加了六倍，而物价却大约上涨了三十倍。一九四七年五月名义工资较战前增加了三十五倍，同一时期工业品的价格却上涨了五十倍，这些数字说明允许实行所谓“生产力充分自由”政策的国家恢复工作，招致了阶级矛盾的深刻化与广大人民的贫穷及失业，并产生了意大利社会经济的新衰颓。
    两年以前，我们还处在恢复民主的工人组织的开始的阶段，今天职工会运动已经成为广大的统一的群众运动了。它包括了大约七百万工业、农业及其他劳动者。合作社还刚在开始组织，但也已成为拥有数百万社员的广大群众性的运动了，共产党自己也巩固了，并已成为伟大的群众性的民主组织了，它已拥有两百多万党员。
    此外还应估计到在紧密联系社会党与共产党的两党一致行动协议中所表现的工人阶级的统一，也是一大成就。这一统一，坚决的反对了一切阴谋及攻击，而使它成为保卫民主成果的柱石。
    但在我国政治生活中两年来也有不少的缺陷，这首先就是意大利民主派的实际目的——经济的及社会的改革——离现实还远得很，这是意大利民主派、民族解放阵线及一切民主党派（共产党在内）的广大缺点。这一缺点之产生，乃是由于特殊条件的影响，这就是意大利是在特殊条件下由法西斯主义之下解放的。新民主主义各国因其借以解放的条件与我国迥异，所以他们得以在实行上述各项社会经济改革的基础上如此大踏步的前进。这一缺点反映在政治上，则是于一定时期它已不成其为民主统一的政治，而是在反动力量的压力及外国帝国主义的直接干涉下组织起政府来了。富有的反动阶级之所以能抬起头来，乃是因为我们没有从根本上打垮它的力量；它为自己的发展找到了如意的基础，乃是因为我们没有进行坚决的斗争以消灭掉一切可能的反动的法西斯运动的萌芽。
    工人阶级及劳动人民必需自卫，并懂得击溃反动派的进攻就是他们的责任。近几个月是大规模的经济、政治搏斗的几个月。这些搏斗大都带着防卫的性质，但结果是工人阶级及劳动人民获得了巨大的胜利。工人阶级的先进力量，在政治上也得到了成功。他们迫使法西斯集团让步（至少暂时是如此）。这些人们曾经想：现在该是开始向新恢复起来的劳动者组织疯狂进攻的时候了。
    显然我们今天是处于危难的时候，我们也感觉到了悬于意大利民主派及意大利人民头上的威胁，这不仅是在我国已造成的形势的结果，并且是全世界已造成的形势的结果，这就是对意大利独立主权与意大利人民自由的威胁。过去数月斗争的结果，乃是意大利人民的奋起，它应该成为新的斗争的起点，成为有组织的行动的起点，新的斗争与行动当可使我们祛除意大利人民所面临的这个威胁。美国帝国主义的政策就是这种威胁，其实质充分表现在“杜鲁门主义”之中。
    美国企图掌握欧洲各国的命运，这些国家现在正经受着经济的因之也是政治的及社会的虚弱。此外绝不应该忘记，欧洲还有许多国家（意大利在内），还没有消灭法西斯主义的根源及国家的叛卖者。还有一些国家如西班牙，那里公开存在的法西斯制度在美帝国主义分子及其他帝国主义大国的保护下，仍继续生存及肆无忌惮的活动。不应该忘记还有希腊这样的国家，其人民在争取独立自由的事业上曾作了决定的贡献，现在由于帝国主义强国——其初是英国，后来是美国——干涉的结果，又被驱回法西斯的深渊中去。一方面是在建立竭力实现世界统治幻想的帝国主义势力集团，因之他们不惜为此破坏各国的独立和平及安宁，另一方面是和平的力量——社会主义国家，它在战争中考验了自己的力量、坚忍不拔的精神、紧密的团结及不可摧毁的社会主义制度。与社会主义国家一起的欧洲其他国家、成功的实现了新民主主义制度、并为建立将向社会主义发展的社会，组成了人民力量的新的统一。（待续）
