　　Truman Laments
  　Economic Crisis Approaches
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd] According to a United Press report from Washington: Truman delivered a speech at the annual banquet of the American Society of Newspaper Editors on the 17th, reflecting a bleak future for American imperialism. Truman said with alarm: Due to "the damage to the national economy caused by the worsening inflation, our economy is in serious danger," and "the United States will face an increasing danger of depression." On the one hand, he shouted himself hoarse and hypocritically, "Take timely action to stop the increasingly serious threat of inflation"; but on the other hand, he had to admit that "certain prominent figures" were still "taking steps to make the problem worse." This Truman, who still hopes to be re-elected president in this year's election, wants to shirk the responsibility for "making the problem worse," but he himself still revealed that all parties are "accusing his government of trying to promote an economic crisis or an international crisis."

　　杜鲁门哀鸣
  　经济危机迫近
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据合众社华盛顿讯：杜鲁门十七日在美国报纸编辑协会年会宴席上发表演说，反映美帝前途一片暗淡。杜鲁门惊惧的说：由于“通货膨胀节节恶化所予国家经济的损害，我们的经济正处在严重的危险中”，“美国将面临愈益增长的萧条危险。”他一面声嘶力竭而伪善地叫喊：“及时采取行动，制止日见严重的通货膨胀之威胁”；但另一面不得不供认：“某些地位显要的人物”仍“采取使问题更加恶化的步骤。”这位还希望在今年大选中连任总统的杜鲁门，想推卸“使问题更加恶化”的责任，但他自己仍透露：各方正“责难其政府企图促成经济危机或国际危机。”
