　　Establish Correct Leadership, Overcome Grabbing Everything
　　Luoyang Village Rectifies Cooperatives
　　[Our News] According to comrades Xing Yi and others from the Border Region Government Production Work Group, some problems and experiences in inspecting and reforming cooperatives in Luoyang Village are worth noting and referencing in the current spring plowing production. The Luoyang Village Cooperative has been operating for two years, with a capital of 7.62 million yuan, of which 2.22 million yuan was raised by the masses and 5.4 million yuan came from the fruits of struggle. Directly under the leadership of the cooperative are ten production units: a lumber mill, a credit cooperative, a cotton ginning workshop, a pharmacy, a general store, an oil mill, a coal mine, a restaurant, a inn, and a grain store. These were all developed successively during mass movements and disaster relief efforts. The cotton ginning workshop, lumber mill, and credit cooperative played a role in supporting the agricultural and sideline production of the masses and in overcoming famine, but at the same time, there were also many problems hindering the development of the cooperative, especially after the promulgation of the Outline Land Law.

　　The cooperative had not resolved the wage issue in two years, and regardless of the business, profits were distributed according to a ratio of 30% for labor and 70% for capital. At the same time, there was an unreasonable remuneration system. The cooperative manager, in the name of also serving as the manager of the cotton ginning workshop, received more than 60,000 yuan in remuneration every six months. Others, such as the cotton ginning workshop clerk and those who ran errands, and pharmacy errand runners, each received remuneration of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Lumber mill and oil mill workers, after dividing the profits for the year, had to pay back a considerable amount of money each year after deducting their wages for carrying stretchers, farming, and substitute labor. The general store owner did not perform much physical labor but received a dividend of 104,000 yuan in ten months, while the oil mill workers who labored for a whole year received a dividend of 25,000 yuan. Farmer Zhang Wenping, who participated in the lumber mill, lost 25,000 yuan last year. Technical workers were not given preferential treatment either. The workers' enthusiasm for production was low, but they were afraid of being labeled as "not serving the masses," "backward and selfish," or "stubborn," so they dared not speak up.

　　Since the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, bad village cadres and a few poor peasants and hired laborers with hooligan habits, using the name of "poor peasants and hired laborers in power" and under the pretext of supporting the production of poor peasants and hired laborers, forcibly withdrew 410,000 yuan from the credit cooperative to establish a poor peasant and hired laborer coal mine. As a result, the coal mine lost money, and the credit cooperative also collapsed. The external debts of each unit also increased daily. The oil mill had a capital of 320,000 yuan and external debts of 266,000 yuan; the lumber mill had a capital of 640,000 yuan and external debts of 410,000 yuan, almost completely halting the turnover of funds. Luoyang Village is a village where land redistribution has not been carried out yet. Some old village cadres in the cooperative had problems and wanted to wash their hands of the matter as soon as possible, pushing it to the poor peasants and hired laborers. Also, because most of the shares were the fruits of struggle, some people considered them village public property and wanted to rob them and make a quick buck. The workers dared not refuse to work and were forced to loaf around in each cooperative. In short, since November of last year, the Luoyang Village Cooperative has been in a state of half-dead, just barely keeping up appearances, and has not been able to exert its effectiveness in leading the masses in production at all. Based on the above situation, we immediately studied ways to promote spring plowing and reform the cooperative. First, we correctly publicized the Outline Land Law. After the mood of the masses stabilized, we thoroughly cultivated the old farmers' association to nurture production, selected 21 men and women from among the middle and poor peasants who were upright, worked year-round, served the masses, had a democratic style, and had prestige among the masses to form a production committee. The cooperative was then directly led by the production committee. It was clarified that supporting the production of the masses should not simply take care of the interests of the poor peasants and hired laborers, but also resolutely protect the interests of the middle peasants, as the interests of the middle and poor peasants are consistent. After the leadership issue was resolved, the outstanding debts were quickly cleared up. Cadre debts were to be returned within a time limit, and the debts of the middle and poor peasants were to be returned in installments according to their specific circumstances. If used for production, they could be used as loans to the credit cooperative to restore the credit cooperative and concentrate capital to specifically solve the difficulties in spring plowing. On the other hand, the masses were mobilized to organize mutual aid, step up spring plowing, and overcome the spring famine. In terms of business policy, the scope of direct management was reduced, and the restoration and development of small-scale cooperatives was resumed. Democratic meetings were held in each unit to review the shortcomings of the past profit distribution system, determine wages, and determine the profit distribution method based on the size of the role of labor and capital in different businesses, and the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital. In order to improve the enthusiasm of labor and give full play to high work efficiency, technical workers and activists in the work were rewarded, and the remuneration system was abolished. After these measures were announced, the fear of the masses was swept away, and they began to prepare for agricultural and sideline production. The chaotic situation of the Luoyang Village Cooperative is likely to exist in villages where land redistribution has not been carried out yet, and reforms should be sought quickly so that they can play a certain role in spring plowing production.

### 树立正确领导克服乱抓一把　洛阳村整顿合作社

　　树立正确领导克服乱抓一把
  　洛阳村整顿合作社
    【本报消息】据边府生产工作组邢毅等同志，在洛阳村检查改造合作社的一些问题和经验，在当前春耕生产中，值得注意参考。洛阳村合作社，已有二年经营历史，资金七百六十二万元，群众集股二百廿二万元，斗争果实五百四十万元。合作社直接领导下计有木厂、信用社、轧花坊、药铺、杂货铺、油坊、煤厂、饭铺、店坊、粮店十个生产单位。这些都是在群众运动及救灾运动中先后发展起来的，轧花坊、木厂、信用社，在扶植群众农副业生产及渡荒上起了些作用，但同时又存在着不少问题，阻碍着合作社的发展，特别是自土地法大纲颁布后，问题更严重。
    合作社二年中没有解决工资问题，不管任何业务均按劳三资七分红，同时存在着不合理的酬劳制度，合作社经理以兼任轧花坊经理的名义，半年取六万余元的酬劳金。其他如轧花坊先生、外跑，药铺外跑，每人均得酬劳金五、六万元，木厂、油坊工人，一年分红所得，除支担架种地工资及代耕米外，每年还要赔不少钱。杂货铺掌柜不出大劳力，十个月分红利十万四千元，油坊工人劳动一整年分红二万五千元。中农张文平因参加木工厂，去年计算赔二万五千元，技术工人亦无优待，工人们生产情绪低落，但怕给戴“不为群众服务”、“落后自私”、“顽固”等大帽子，也不敢吭。
    自土地法大纲颁布后，坏村干和少数有二流子习气的贫雇，利用“贫雇当权”名义，借口扶植贫雇生产，硬将信用社的存款四十一万元抽出设立贫雇煤厂，结果煤厂赔本，但用社也随之垮台。各单位外欠帐也逐日增加，油坊资本三十二万元，外欠帐二十六万六千元；木厂资本六十四万元，外欠帐四十一万元，几使资金周转完全停滞。洛阳村是未进行填补的村庄，有些旧村干在社里有问题想趁早洗手，推给贫雇；又因为股金大部是斗争果实，一部分人认为是村公产，想伙打劫，捞一把；工人们不敢不干，被迫在各社混时光。总之，自去年十一月至今，洛阳村合作社处于半死不活支应门面的状态，丝毫不能发挥领导群众生产的效能。根据以上情况，当即研究推动春耕及改造合作社的办法。首先正确宣传土地法大纲，群众情绪安定后，即深入旧农会酝酿生产，从中贫农中选出为人正派、常年劳动、为群众服务、作风民主、在群众中有威信的男女廿一人，组成生产委员会，合作社转由生产委员会直接领导，明确扶植群众生产，不能单纯照顾贫雇利益，中农利益，也要坚决保护，中贫农利益是一致的。领导问题解决后，即迅速清理外欠，干部欠帐一律限期归还，中贫农外欠按其具体情况分期归还。如用于生产，可作为向信用社的贷款，使信用社恢复，以便集中资本具体解决春耕中困难。另一方面动员群众整理互助，加紧春耕，渡过春荒。在业务方针上，缩小直接经营范围，恢复扶植发展小型社，各单位社召开民主会议，检讨过去分红制度的缺点，确定工资，根据不同业务中劳力与资金作用的大小，劳资两利的原则确定分红办法。为提高劳动工作热情，发挥高度的工作效能，奖励技术工人和工作中积极分子，取消酬劳金制度。这些办法宣布后，群众的恐惧情绪为之一扫，开始准备农副业生产。象洛阳村合作社这种混乱情况，在未进行填补的村庄，很可能存在类似的问题，应速求得改造，使能在春耕生产中发挥一定作用。
