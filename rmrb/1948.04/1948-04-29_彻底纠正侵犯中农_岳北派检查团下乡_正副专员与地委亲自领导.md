    Thoroughly Correcting Infringements on Middle Peasants
    Yuebei Sends Inspection Teams to the Countryside
    Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner and the Prefectural Committee Personally Lead the Effort
    [Taiyue News] In many areas of Yuebei last winter, the interests of middle peasants were seriously harmed, leading to low morale for production among the masses this spring. According to a letter from the Qinyuan County Party Committee, many villages' middle peasants wanted to offer up their land. In × village, the land that middle peasants wanted to offer reached three *qing*. They also said, "If you don't want it, don't blame us if it goes to waste." In Mianshang, middle peasants not only offered land but also sheep. They said, "We don't dare hire shepherds anymore; how could we dare exploit people?" Middle peasants in Dongcun said, "What's the point of running a household in this era?" Since calling on various regions to correct the tendency of harming middle peasants' interests, although some regions have lifted restrictions on middle peasants, the correction has not been thorough. The Yuebei Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office recently organized spring plowing inspection teams, personally led by the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner and the Propaganda Minister of the Prefectural Committee. They were divided into three groups: one to Tunliu, Qin County, and Changzi along the Baijin Line; one to Qinyuan and Anze; and one to Huo County and Zhaocheng. According to the *Taiyue Xinhua Daily* editorial, the teams will thoroughly correct the tendency of harming the interests of middle peasants, resolve the masses' fears of becoming wealthy and fears of equal distribution, and correct the hesitation and wavering of cadres at all levels in implementing the Party's policies. The teams have now departed.
    [Taiyue News] In the second district of Yishi, Jinan, many middle peasants were struggled against during last year's mass movement instead of being united to struggle together. In Lijiazhuang, half of the households in one *lv* were struggled against, nine of which were middle peasants. This phenomenon of infringing on the interests of middle peasants was very common, so middle peasants were afraid of struggle and had no heart for production. Seven or eight middle peasant households in Nandachen village discussed, "The work team that received training is coming back, so it will be our turn. Prepare to be struggled against." Fan Gengyin, a middle peasant in Lijiazhuang, asked the masses to struggle against him, believing that since he would be struggled against anyway, he might as well get it over with sooner rather than later. Zhang Sangang, a middle peasant in Nandachen who cultivated forty *mu* of land, sold his livestock under the pretext of having to do corvee labor with no one to feed the animals, because he was afraid of struggle. In order to reverse this mood, the Second District first widely publicized the policy towards middle peasants. After a month of repeated publicity and explanation, everyone's production enthusiasm has undergone a preliminary transformation. Zhang Sangang bought another head of livestock, saying, "Last year I was afraid of being struggled against. This time I know that middle peasants won't be struggled against, so I must produce well." According to incomplete statistics, the entire Second District has now increased by fifty-three head of livestock.

    彻底纠正侵犯中农
    岳北派检查团下乡
    正副专员与地委亲自领导
    【太岳消息】岳北去年冬天很多地区严重伤害中农利益，今春群众生产情绪低落。据沁源县委来信谈，不少村子的中农要献地，×村中农欲献之地竟达三顷。还说：“你们如果不要，荒了也不能怪我们。”绵上中农除献田外，还要献羊。他们说：“不敢雇羊工了，咱还敢剥削人？”东村中农说：“这个年代还闹什么家务？”自号召各地纠正伤害中农偏向后，虽然有的地区已解除对中农的管制等，但并没彻底纠正过来。岳北地委与专署最近特组织春耕检查团，由正副专员和地委宣传部长亲自领导，分成三个组，一组到白晋线的屯留、沁县、长子，一组到沁源、安泽，一组到霍县、赵城。根据太岳新华日报社论，彻底纠正伤害中农偏向，解决群众中怕发财、怕平分等思想，并纠正各地干部在执行党的政策时束手束脚，犹疑动摇等现象。该团现已出发。
    【太岳消息】晋南猗氏二区在去年大运动中，不但没有团结中农一起斗争，反把许多中农斗争了。李家庄一闾半人家就斗了十户，其中有九户是中农。这种侵犯中农利益的现象很普遍，所以中农害怕斗争，无心生产。南大陈村七八户中农议论说：“这次受训的工作队回来了，就轮着咱啦，准备叫人家斗吧。”李家庄中农樊更寅要求群众斗争自己，他认为反正要斗争，早斗争早安心。南大陈中农张三刚种着四十来亩地，因为怕斗争，借口要支差，没人喂，把牲口卖了。二区为了扭转这种情绪，先广泛的宣传中农政策，经一个月的反复宣传解释，大家生产情绪已有初步转变。张三刚又买了一头牲口，他说：“年时怕斗争，这回知道不斗中农了，就要好好生产。”据不完全统计，现全二区已增加了五十三头牲口。
