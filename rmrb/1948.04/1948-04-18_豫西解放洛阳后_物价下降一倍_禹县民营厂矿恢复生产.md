Xinhua News Agency, Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 14th: Since the liberation of Luoyang, western Henan, the people in the liberated areas of western Henan have been greatly encouraged. The value of the Jicha banknote has increased, and prices have generally fallen. In areas such as Linru, Dengfeng, and Yuxian, the exchange rate between the Jicha banknote and the Kuomintang currency has risen from 1:25 to 1:50. In Chexifang, Yiyang, it has risen to 1:100. In Linru, wheat per dou (38 jin) has fallen from 20,000 Jicha banknotes to 11,000 Jicha banknotes, and gaoliang per dou has fallen from 14,000 Jicha banknotes to 7,000 Jicha banknotes. When Yuxian was occupied by the Kuomintang, wheat per dou (56 jin) had risen to 2.5 million Kuomintang currency. After its recovery at the beginning of this month, it immediately fell by 54 percent. Millet also fell by 44 percent, and gaoliang fell by 25 percent. As grain prices fall, prices in various places are also becoming stable. Pork in Chexifang, Yiyang, costs only 300 Jicha banknotes per jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 14th: With the support of the democratic government, private factories and mines in Yuxian, a famous coal and porcelain producing area in western Henan, have rapidly resumed production. Mines in Shuangshibei, Zhutun, and Majiadong in the west of the city, and Dongfeng, Fuyu, and Dongxing mines in the south of the city are mining all day long, and merchants and vehicles are constantly traveling back and forth. The "Jun porcelain" produced in Shengou Town, southwest of the city, is famous throughout the country. During the Kuomintang occupation, more than 70 porcelain kilns were unable to withstand the heavy burdens and closed down one after another, leaving only a dozen or so. After liberation, the democratic government explicitly abolished all heavy burdens. In addition to the original dozen or so continuing production, those that closed down are also planning to resume production. Three small soap factories, including Huaxing in Yuxian City, and two cigarette companies, Yiqi and Dahuanyun, are also actively producing with the support of the government. The government stipulates that the unified cigarette tax will only be temporarily collected at 15 percent (the Kuomintang bandits collected more than 100 percent). Dahuanyun Cigarette Company closed down during the Kuomintang occupation due to excessive burdens. It only resumed operation after liberation. In order to help it recover, the government has temporarily granted tax exemption. Yuxian is also a distribution center for medicinal materials. After liberation, the government has made great efforts to protect drug merchants, and exports are booming. On the 9th, more than 10,000 jin of medicinal materials were exported in one day.

　　豫西解放洛阳后
  　物价下降一倍
    禹县民营厂矿恢复生产
    【新华社豫陕鄂十四日电】洛阳解放后，豫西解放区人心振奋，冀币比值提高，物价普遍下降。临汝、登封、禹县等地冀币与蒋币比值都由一比二十五升至一比五十，伊阳车西房一地已升至一比一百。临汝麦子每斗（三十八斤）已由冀币二万元降至一万一千元，＠头每斗由冀币一万四千元降至七千元。禹县城在蒋占时，麦子每斗（五十六斤）曾涨到蒋币二百五十万元；本月初收复后，立即下降百分之五十四，小米亦下降百分之四十四，＠头下降百分之二十五。随着粮价下降，各地物价亦趋平稳。伊阳车西房猪肉每斤仅合冀币三百元。
    【新华社豫陕鄂十四日电】豫西著名的煤与瓷器产地禹县，在民主政府扶持下，各民营厂矿纷纷迅速恢复生产。城西双石碑、朱屯、马家洞，及城南东峰、福裕、东兴等矿都整日开采，商贩车马络绎于途。城西南神垢镇所产“钧瓷”，著名全国。蒋占时期，七十多家瓷窑不堪苛杂负担，纷纷倒闭，只剩下十余家。解放后民主政府明令取消一切苛杂，除原有十多家继续生产外，倒闭各家也正谋恢复。禹县城内华兴等三家小型肥皂厂和义＠、大寰云两家卷烟公司，也在政府扶植下积极生产，政府规定卷烟统税只暂收百分之十五（蒋匪征收额达百分之百以上）。大寰云烟公司在蒋占时因苛杂太重而倒闭，解放后始复业。政府为扶助其恢复，并暂予免税待遇。又禹县亦为药材集散地，解放后，政府极力保护药商，出口颇旺，九日一天中出口药材达一万多斤。
