Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 11th: Moscow Dispatch: *Izvestia* published an article commenting on the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, stating that this treaty is another achievement in the struggle for peace and security for all countries, and it has significant international importance. The fact that the Soviet Union has concluded another treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with a country that was recently in the opposing camp powerfully demonstrates the Soviet Union's unwavering commitment to a peaceful policy and once again proves the Soviet Union's respect for the national sovereignty of the Finnish people, which is a characteristic of Soviet foreign policy. This respect is manifested in the fact that, as Molotov stated, "the treaty draft proposed by the Finnish government was taken as the basis for negotiations." It is also reflected in the entire content of the treaty. The Soviet-Finnish negotiations, as well as the negotiations between the Soviet Union and various countries, large and small, serve as an example of international cooperation based on equality between the parties, consideration of mutual interests, and mutual respect for sovereignty and independence. As early as November 1917, Stalin pointed out, when referring to eliminating the hatred between the two countries caused by the Tsarist government and restoring mutual trust: "It is impossible to rebuild this mutual trust if the Finnish people's free right to self-determination is not recognized." History has proven Stalin's words: Finland gained its independence from the Soviet Union. During the debate on the Finnish peace treaty at the 1946 Paris Peace Conference, Molotov pointed out: "We have made great efforts to give Finland the right to live according to its own will—a right that Finland tried hard but in vain to obtain from Tsarist Russia." However, certain politicians and political groups, both inside and outside Finland, have attempted to turn Finland into a tool of imperialist aggression, a weapon for their anti-Soviet and anti-democratic criminal policies, and they have obstructed Finland from approaching its great neighbor. However, Soviet-Finnish relations have undergone two rigorous tests in the past decade, and these tests have told the Finnish people how much harm these politicians and political groups have caused them. They know that only by maintaining friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union can they consolidate their national independence and national sovereignty, and ensure the peaceful development of their economic and cultural life.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 11th: Helsinki Dispatch: The Finnish people unanimously welcomed the Soviet-Finnish treaty signed on the 6th. Even the American and British news agencies, which had been constantly spreading rumors, slandering, and sowing discord in Soviet-Finnish friendship since January, had to admit that "the Finnish people accept the Soviet-Finnish treaty as a good treaty" (Associated Press). Finnish progressive newspapers have written articles praising it. *Työkansan Sanomat* emphasized: "The Soviet-Finnish treaty greatly consolidates Finland's international position and helps to ensure European peace." It also emphasized that the treaty fully reflects the Soviet Union's respect for Finnish sovereignty. *Vapaa Sana* said: "Regardless of how reactionary forces attempt to oppose the signing of this treaty, the Finnish people have finally victoriously completed one of the most important steps in safeguarding their national survival."

### 苏芬报纸赞扬新约　苏联尊重芬兰主权

　　苏芬报纸赞扬新约
  　苏联尊重芬兰主权
    【新华社陕北十一日电】莫斯科讯：消息报撰文评论苏芬友好合作互助条约称：这一条约是争取各国和平与安全之斗争的又一成就，它具有重大的国际意义。苏联又多和一个不久以前还在敌对阵营中的国家订立了友好合作互助条约，这一事实特别有力地证明了苏联不遗余力以奉行和平政策，并又一次证明了苏联对芬兰人民国家主权的尊重，这是苏联外交政策的特色。这种尊重表现于下一事实，即莫洛托夫所称：“以芬兰政府所提的条约草案为谈判基础。”同时也表现在条约全部内容上。苏芬谈判以及苏联和各大小国家间进行的谈判，是以双方平等、考虑双方利益、互相尊重主权与独立为基础的国际合作的范例。早在一九一七年十一月，斯大林提到消除沙皇政府造成的两国间的仇恨，并使之重新互相信任时，曾指出：“如果不承认芬兰人民自由的自决权，就没有可能重建这种互信。”历史证实了斯大林的话：芬兰自苏联获得了它的独立。一九四六年巴黎和会辩论对芬和约时，莫洛托夫指出：“我们已尽了很大的努力，给芬兰以按其自己意志而生活的权利——这种权利是芬兰极力想从沙皇俄国得到而徒劳无效的。”但在芬兰国内外却有某些政客和政治团体，企图把芬兰变为帝国主义侵略的工具，变为他们反苏反民主的罪恶政策的武器，他们阻挠芬兰和它的伟大的邻邦接近。然而过去十年中苏芬关系曾经过两次严格考验，这些考验告诉芬兰人民，这些政客和政治团体给他们造成了多大的祸害，他们知道只有和苏联保持友好合作，才能巩固其民族独立和国家主权，才能保证其经济和文化生活的和平发展。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】赫尔辛基讯：芬兰人民一致欢迎六日签字的苏芬条约。连一月以来不断造谣侮蔑、挑拨离间苏芬友谊的美英通讯社，也不得不承认“芬兰人民接受苏芬条约，认为是一个好条约”（美联社语）。芬兰进步报纸更纷纷著论赞扬。杜坎森·杉诺玛报着重指出：“苏芬条约大大巩固了芬兰的国际地位，而且有助于保证欧洲和平。”并强调条约充分反映出苏联对芬兰主权的尊重。瓦巴·沙那报说：“不管反动派如何企图反对签订这一条约，芬兰人民终于胜利地完成了保障其国家生存最重要的一个步骤。”
