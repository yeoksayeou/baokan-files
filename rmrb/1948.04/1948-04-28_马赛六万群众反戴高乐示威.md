Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. Reports from various sources: De Gaulle, the public enemy of the French people, arrived in Marseille on the 14th to attend the first representative conference of his fascist organization, the "French People's Rally." When the bandit De Gaulle ranted against the Soviet Union and communism on a barge at the Barqui wharf in Marseille on the 18th, 20,000 police and military police dispatched by Schuman were on guard on the roofs and buildings near the river wharf. However, 60,000 working people in Marseille held a large demonstration and march in the nearby streets, protesting the criminal plans of the De Gaulle League and expressing their "determination to prevent the reactionaries' plans." (L'Humanité) Participants in the demonstration included members of the United Federation of Former French Interior Forces, volunteer soldiers, guerrillas, as well as members of the Communist Party, left-wing Radical Party, left-wing Socialist Party, and the General Confederation of Labor. Jean Yane, a former member of the De Gaulle League Steering Committee, addressed the participants, exposing De Gaulle as "a traitor to the revival movement and the ringleader of a rebel alliance." He excitedly said, "Although we are not communists, we have the right to warn De Gaulle: you have no right to call the Communist Party splitters." Then, Communist MP Billoux spoke, emphasizing that what De Gaulle was advocating was "old, reactionary, and fascist ideas; he is demanding power in order to realize his dictatorial plan."
