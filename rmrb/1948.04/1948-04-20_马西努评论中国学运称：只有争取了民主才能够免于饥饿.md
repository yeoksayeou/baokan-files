　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Moscow Radio broadcast on the 13th a commentary by Masinu, which reads in brief: Chinese newspapers have reported news of a new upsurge in the Chinese student movement, which is a noteworthy event. This proves that the progressive intellectual movement is part of the national movement of China, and therefore the Kuomintang reactionaries are powerless to suppress it.
　　The Kuomintang reactionaries have taken various measures in an attempt to suppress the patriotic democratic movement of students, but the reactionaries' intensified means of suppression have not weakened but rather stimulated the student movement. On March 15th, when the Kuomintang Shanghai court opened the trial of eleven arrested students of Tongji University, early that morning students from various schools came to the front of the court in a steady stream, forming a huge contingent of more than a thousand (note: some say more than three thousand) students, preparing to rush into the court. The Kuomintang hurriedly dispatched more than three hundred armed police to guard the court building. During the trial, the student masses shouted slogans and sang songs, forcing the court authorities to allow ten student representatives to enter and observe the proceedings. When the trial ended, a female student presented a bouquet of flowers to the suffering classmates, immediately arousing enthusiastic applause from the audience. This fact clearly demonstrates the lofty enthusiasm and fearless spirit of Chinese students. Since then, the student movement in major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has developed rapidly, reaching a new high tide of the movement since the end of March and the beginning of April. In North China, the scale of this movement is particularly grand. Masinu finally said: Chinese students understand very well that only by realizing democracy can they fundamentally improve their living and learning conditions, therefore they are actively fighting for the democratic reform of their country.

　　马西努评论中国学运称：只有争取了民主才能够免于饥饿
    【新华社陕北十八日电】莫斯科电台十三日广播马西努评论略称：中国报纸传出了中国学生运动新高涨的消息，这是一个值得注意的事件。这证明进步知识分子的运动是中国全民族运动的一部分，因此国民党反动派是无力把它镇压下去的。
    国民党反动派曾采取了各种办法，企图镇压学生爱国民主运动，可是反动派加强镇压的手段，不但没有削弱反而更激发了学生运动。三月十五日，当国民党上海法院开审十一名同济大学被捕学生时，该日清早各校学生就源源不断来到法院门前，结成了千多（按：一说三千多）学生的巨大队伍，准备冲入法院，国民党慌忙派了三百多名武装警察守住了法院房屋。开审时，学生群众高呼口号并唱歌，迫得法庭当局只好允许十名学生代表入内旁听，当审判终结时，一位女学生将一束鲜花投献给受难同学，立刻引起到庭观审群众的全场热烈鼓掌。这一事实极显明的表现中国学生的崇高热情和大无畏的精神。从此以后，国民党统治区各大城市学生运动即迅速发展，而达到了三月底和四月初以来运动的新高涨。在华北，这一运动的规模特别宏大。马西努最后说：中国学生很明白，只有实现了民主，才能根本改善他们的生活和学习条件，因此他们正为自己国家的民主改革而积极奋斗。
