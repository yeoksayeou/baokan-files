　　Unable to Bear the Kuomintang Reactionary Army's Atrocities of Conscription and Grain Seizure

    Northern Henan Masses Rise Up to Resist Chiang
  　Many Peasants Flee to Liberated Areas to Settle Down
    [Report from this newspaper] In the Kuomintang reactionary areas of Xiuwu, Huojia, Wu陟 (Zhi), and areas near Jiaozuo in northern Henan, the masses, under the Kuomintang reactionaries' frenzied conscription, grain seizure, exorbitant taxes, and miscellaneous levies, have risen up to resist Chiang, tying up and beating puppet Bao chiefs, and looting grain depots, engaging in a desperate struggle with the Kuomintang reactionaries. Since the beginning of spring, the grain shortage and unprecedented soaring prices in the Kuomintang reactionary areas of northern Henan have plunged these areas into extreme chaos, making it difficult to maintain their rule. Especially after our great victory in western Henan, prices in Jiaozuo and other places rose several times a day, with millet increasing from 650,000 yuan per dou in early March to 1,500,000 yuan per dou. People have no food or grain and are truly struggling to survive. At the same time, the Kuomintang reactionaries are carrying out large-scale "forced levies," and if they cannot find grain, they seize even the remaining sweet potatoes, persimmon pieces, bran, and sauerkraut that the common people have left. In Zhaodian Village near Jiaozuo, among more than 200 households (mostly Hui people), more than 150 households have no grain at home and have mostly become beggars. When the people try to seize food from the bandits, the Kuomintang reactionaries use bayonets and machine guns to massacre them, forcing the people to the point of desperation. Hungry people have risen up to loot the enemy's grain depots. In the old seventh district of Wu陟 (Kuomintang-controlled area), the Kuomintang reactionaries demanded a forced levy of 1,100 able-bodied men from just one district, sixteen from large Baos and eight from small Baos. Young people are hiding everywhere, and some are fleeing to our areas. The bandit township offices are grabbing people day and night. If they cannot find people, they tie up Bao chiefs and beat Jia chiefs. None of the puppet Bao and Jia chiefs want to continue doing this job. Several villages in the Qiancun area currently have no Bao chiefs. The Bao chief of Liuma Village, ten li away from Yangqiao, ran away because he could not collect enough grain or conscript enough men, fearing being tied up and beaten by the township office. Later, the Kuomintang reactionaries sent another Bao chief, but the villagers beat him away as well.
    [Report from this newspaper] Impoverished peasants in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Wu陟 and Anyang, unable to bear the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries' conscription and grain collection, and influenced by the powerful political offensive of our border troops and civilians, have been fleeing to the liberated areas to settle down and live. On the 18th of last month, bricklayer Xue Heiniu and six others fled from their hometown of Yang Village in Wu陟, which is occupied by the Kuomintang reactionaries, to Dashima Village in our area to find work. Heiniu said: "This side and that side (referring to the liberated area and the Kuomintang-controlled area) are simply two different worlds. When we fled from home, millet on that side had already risen to 700,000 or 800,000 yuan per dou. The land only yields a little grain, which is not even enough to pay the donations and taxes to the (puppet) township office. My family of four, because we couldn't find work, my wife and children were begging for food; it would be good if we could all live a good life like the folks here." Guo Tuzi, a peasant from Guojiazhuang in Anyang who recently fled to our second district of Tangyin, said: "The 'ill-fated army' over there (referring to the Kuomintang army) is grabbing people everywhere, and they are forcing young people to join the hui (participate in the Kuomintang-organized hui groups). When you go to the fields to do some work, you might get grabbed without warning. The people are looking forward to the western army (referring to the People's Liberation Army) every day to eliminate those bastards. I couldn't live at home, so I sneaked out in the dark, first to settle down here, and then find a way to move my family here." Masses who fled from the border areas of Xiuwu in the past, after hearing our propaganda about the Land Law, have been running back to the liberated areas. On the 19th and 20th of last month alone, seven households, a total of thirty-seven people, returned, also bringing back six head of livestock, preparing for spring plowing and production. They all said with regret: "In the past, we mistakenly listened to the enemy's deceptive propaganda and ran to that side (referring to the Kuomintang-controlled area). We had nothing to eat or drink; it was really a living hell." Now, local governments and the masses in our various areas are finding ways to resettle and help the masses who have fled to and returned to our areas to carry out production.

　　不堪蒋匪抓丁抢粮暴行
    豫北群众奋起抗蒋
  　很多农民逃来解放区安家
    【本报消息】豫北修、获、武及焦作附近等地蒋匪区群众，在蒋匪疯狂抓盯抢粮横征暴敛下，纷纷奋起抗蒋，捆打伪保长，抢打粮食房，与蒋匪进行决死的斗争。豫北蒋匪区入春以来的粮荒及物价空前飞涨，使蒋匪区陷于极度混乱和难以持维其统治的状态中。特别在我豫西大胜后，焦作等地物价一日数涨，小米每斗由三月初的六十五万元涨至一百五十万元，人民无粮无食，实难度日。同时蒋匪却又大肆“强征”，弄不到粮食，就连老百姓仅存的红薯及柿块、糠面、酸菜等也都抢去。焦作附近的赵店村，二百余户人家中（多系回民），现家无颗粮的一百五十多户，大部变成了乞食者。人民与匪夺食，蒋匪便以刺刀及机枪来屠杀，逼的人们走头无路，饥民起来把敌人的粮食房抢了。武陟旧七区（蒋管区划）一个区蒋匪即要强征一千一百个壮丁，大保十六个，小保八个，青年人都乱躲乱藏，有的则逃向我区。匪乡公所白天黑夜到处乱抓，抓不到人便拴保长，打甲长，伪保甲长谁也不愿再干，千村一带几个村子现都没有了保长；离洋桥十里地的六马村保长因收不起粮，要不起丁，怕乡公所捆打也跑了，后来，蒋匪又派去一个保长，村上老百姓也把他打跑了。
    【本报消息】武陟、安阳等地蒋管区贫苦农民，因受不了蒋匪抓丁征粮的黑暗统治，和在我边地军民强大政治攻势的影响下，纷纷逃来解放区安家生活。上月十八日，泥水匠薛黑牛等七人，从蒋匪盘踞的武陟杨村老家逃来我区大司马村找生活做。黑牛说：“这边和那边（指解放区和蒋管区）简直是两个天下，我们从家里逃出时，那边的小米就已涨到每斗七、八十万元了。地里就收点粮食，还不够给（伪）乡公所出捐税。我一家四口人，因为找不到生活做，老婆孩子讨饭吃；那里能象这边的老乡们，大家过着好时光就好了”。最近逃来我汤阴二区的安阳郭家庄农民郭秃子说：“那边的‘遭殃军’到处抓丁，还强迫青年人都得在会（参加蒋匪组织的会门）。上地里做些活，不防备就让抓走啦。老百姓每天在想望着西边的军队（指解放军），去消灭那些混帐东西。我在家里没法过，趁黑夜偷跑出来，先到咱们这里安顿一下，再设法回去把家搬来。”修武边地过去逃亡的群众，听到我宣传土地法后，纷纷跑回解放区。单在上月十九、二十两天中，就回来了七户，共三十七口人，还带回牲口六头，准备进行春耕生产。他们都后悔的说：“过去误听了敌人的欺骗宣传，跑到那边（指蒋管区），吃没吃，喝没喝，真是活受罪啦。”现在我各地政府、群众，对逃来和返回我区的群众，正设法安置与帮助他们进行生产。
