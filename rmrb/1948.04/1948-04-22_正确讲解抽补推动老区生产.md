　　【Comprehensive News from This Newspaper】In several districts and villages of Taihang and Jinnan, efforts to stabilize production sentiment and organize spring plowing and sowing have achieved some success. In the past, leadership only publicized the articles of the Land Law Outline, without explaining the specific implementation methods for old liberated area villages and policies for various classes and strata. Farmers were waiting for radical redistribution and did not dare to produce, and middle peasants were even more panicked. Village cadres, because they had made mistakes to some extent, were unsure of their future and did not actively lead production, thus creating a chaotic situation in the countryside. Recently, some districts and villages have specifically publicized and explained the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Central Bureau, stating that radical redistribution will not be implemented in old liberated areas, and pointing out that cadres leading production is meritorious, as well as the Border Region Government's announcement of "whoever plants, harvests." Cadres and the masses have gradually shifted from passive waiting to striving for production. Many villages have automatically organized spring plowing production committees to lead farmers in voluntarily forming mutual aid teams, or have initially reorganized old mutual aid organizations. In Zanhuang, cotton planting has therefore formed a mass movement, and the entire county is striving to exceed the original plan of planting 20,000 mu of cotton. In Beiyan Village, with 760 people, 270 mu were planted in three days, exceeding the slogan of "three fen per person." In Beizhuli Village, with 330 people, 102 mu have already been planted, and they plan to plant another 100 mu. In Qicun, Xingtai, cotton planting has reached 4.8 fen per person, and many mutual aid team members have reached 9 fen per person. They are now rushing to plant millet and weed wheat. In Xidiwan Village, a total of 60 mu of virgin and cultivated land were opened, and the entire village has now completed planting and is continuing to open up wasteland. In the third district of Pingshun, cotton planting reached 2,600 mu in early April. Millet planting and wheat weeding are also in full swing. In Dongquanshan Village, Yuanzhao First District, fifteen new pigsties and manure pits have recently been added, thirty pigs and five cattle have been added, and the number of manure buyers has also greatly increased. After automatically organizing mutual aid, they selected thirty-five masons capable of building houses and walls to go out to work and earn money, with high morale. In Xiaozhai Village, Second District of Jize, nine-tenths of the cultivated land has been plowed twice, and the remaining white land from the previous year has also been plowed at least once. In Xifeng Village, Shahe, in addition to agricultural mutual aid, they also mutually aid in kiln firing and transportation, earning a lot of money. Landless farmers and those who were struggled against in Taziyu Village borrowed more than 100 mu of land stored by the farmers' association to cultivate, planting 635 mu of cotton alone. In Dongmiao Village, Third District of Changzhi, the masses did not even deliver manure some time ago. Now, in addition to actively delivering manure for spring plowing, they have also selected twenty-nine livestock to transport saltpeter to Qin County, earning 1.2 million yuan in six days, which will be used to buy manure and add livestock.

　　正确讲解抽补　推动老区生产
    【本报综合消息】太行、冀南若干区村，安定生产情绪与组织春耕下种的努力，已经获得一些成绩。过去由于领导上只宣传了土地法大纲的条文，没有宣传老区村庄的具体实施办法与对各阶级、阶层的政策，农民都等待着打乱平分，不敢生产，老中农更有恐慌情绪；村干部因为自己多少有过错误，摸不清将来究竟落个什么下场，也不积极领导生产，所以形成农村的混乱局面。最近，有些区村由于具体宣传解释了党中央与中央局指示，说明老区不实行打乱平分，并指出干部领导生产即是功劳，及边府谁种谁收的布告，干部与群众乃由消极等待逐渐转向努力生产。许多村庄已自动组织了春耕生产委员会，领导农民自愿结合互助组，或初步整顿了旧的互助组织。赞皇的种棉，已因此形成群众运动，全县要争取超过原订种棉二万亩的计划。七百六十口人的北延庄，三天种了二百七十亩，已超过“每人三分”的口号。三百三十口人的北竹里村已经种了一百零二亩，还准备再种百亩。邢台祁村每人种棉已达到四分八，互助组员有许多达到每人九分。现正突击种谷、锄麦。×地湾村开生荒熟荒共六十亩，全村现已下种完毕，正继续开荒。平顺三区本月初旬种棉达二千六百亩。种谷锄麦也在紧张进行。元朝一区东劝善村最近新添猪圈粪坑十五个，添猪三十口，牛五头，买粪户也大增。他们自动组织好互助后，即抽出三十五个能够盖房垒墙的泥水匠出去做工赚钱，情绪很高。鸡泽二区小寨村十分之九的耕地已犁过两遍，年前剩下的白地也至少犁过一遍。沙河西冯村除农业互助外，并互助下窑烧盆、运输，赚钱很多。塔子峪村少地农民与被斗户将农会存地一百多亩都借去耕种起来，光棉花就种了六百三十五亩。长治三区东苗村前些时群众连粪都不送，现在除积极送粪春耕外，还抽出二十九个牲口到沁县运硝，六天赚洋一百二十万元，准备用来买粪、添牲口。（马琳、政民、成海、申宗南、云亭、王景云、梦僧等）
