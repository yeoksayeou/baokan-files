Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 6th. The Northwest Peasant Bank in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin Sui Border Region has recently established in-kind deposit business to protect the interests of depositors during wartime from being affected by prices. It is tentatively set for two types of goods: homespun cloth and wheat. The minimum deposit quantity is one zhang of homespun cloth and one sheng of millet, and there is no limit to the maximum amount. If depositing cash, it will be converted into in-kind deposits according to the local market price of the trade company at that time. The deposit terms are divided into three months, half a year, and one year. Upon maturity, the depositor can present the deposit slip to the local bank to withdraw the in-kind principal and interest, or convert it into banknotes according to the local market price of the trade company at that time. If the depositor is unwilling to withdraw upon maturity, they can freely renew the term; if it is not withdrawn after the expiration date, the bank will automatically renew the principal and interest together and continue to accrue interest. Interest is calculated based on the actual goods. The monthly interest rate is 5‰ for three months, 7‰ for half a year, and 9‰ for one year. This business was first launched by the head office, and now the branches have also begun to promote it.

　　西北农民银行创办实物存款
    【新华社西北六日电】陕甘宁晋绥边区西北农民银行于最近创办实物存款业务，以保障战时存款人的利益不受物价影响。暂定为土布、小麦两种，存入数量最少是土布一丈、小米一升，最多额不加限制。若存现款，即按当时当地贸易公司市价折成实物存入。存款的期限分为三个月、半年、一年三种，到期存款人即可凭存单到当地银行支取实物本息或按当时当地贸易公司市价折取票币；若到期不愿支取时，可自由转期；过期不取者，银行即自动将其本息一并转期，继续生息。利息均按实物计算，三个月者按月息五厘算，半年者按月息七厘算，一年者按月息九厘计算。此项业务，最先由总行举办，现各分行亦已开始推行。
