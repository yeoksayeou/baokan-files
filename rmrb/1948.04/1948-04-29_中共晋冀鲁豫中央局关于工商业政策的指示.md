    CPC Jinji-Luyu Central Bureau's Instructions on Industrial and Commercial Policies

    The current state of industry and commerce in our region can be broadly divided into three types of towns (areas).

    The first type: The original industry and commerce has been largely or completely preserved, and new industry and commerce has developed, such as in Linqing, Nangong, Hengshui, Quwo, Qucun, etc. The economy is developing, and the market is prosperous. This type of town (area) accounts for about one-quarter of all towns (areas) in the region.

    The second type: The original industry and commerce has largely or partially collapsed, and some new industry and commerce has also developed, such as in Handan, Jincheng, Yangyi (under Wu'an), HenanDian (under Shexian), etc. This type of town (area) accounts for about one-quarter of all towns (areas) in the region.

    The third type: The original industry and commerce has largely or completely collapsed, and new industry and commerce has developed very little, such as in Wu'an, Daming, Wenxi, etc. This type of town (area) accounts for about two-quarters of all towns (areas) in the region.

    The reasons for the destruction of industry and commerce and its inability to recover quickly, apart from objective factors (such as the impact of war and the influence of the Kuomintang's reactionary policies), include the following five points in policy that are worth reviewing:

    (1) During the anti-traitor liquidation, the definitions of traitors, bullies, secret agents, and bureaucratic capitalists were vague and unclear. There was no clear and strict distinction between which stores and factories should be considered traitors, local bullies, or bureaucratic capital that could be liquidated and confiscated, and which should be protected. This greatly harmed industry and commerce. The struggle against industry and commerce during land reform did not clearly separate the boundaries between capitalism and feudalism. Some people believed that industry and commerce were all feudalistic in nature and that without struggling against industry and commerce, feudalism could not be eradicated and the demands of the masses could not be met. For example, in Changzhi South Street, all middle merchants were overthrown. Xingtai, Handan, Jincheng, Wu'an, and Qinyang were all overthrown under the general term of feudalism because this boundary was not clearly defined.

    (2) High wage policy. The labor movement is generally blindly based on the immediate welfare of workers, without considering labor movement policies. Is it beneficial for workers if factories and stores close down, or is it beneficial for workers if the economy develops? This was not considered. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Taihang had a regulation that regardless of the type of worker, wages had to be maintained to support one and a half people. After Japan's surrender, the annual salaries of workers and shop assistants in Xingtai were all over 300,000 yuan (Ji currency). In the Tongsheng Iron Factory, in addition to an annual salary of 330,000 yuan, workers received a "three-seven" profit sharing. The Yixingsheng Trading Company, with a capital of 500,000 yuan, employed two shop assistants. One joined the army and received 220,000 yuan in support, and the other got married and received 320,000 yuan in assistance. The shop owner provided the wife's food, clothing, housing, and transportation for a long time, and the salary was still paid. The daily wage for shop assistants in Wu'an was fifteen jin of millet. The daily wage for Pengcheng porcelain workers was eighteen jin of millet. Because the capitalist couldn't afford the wages, it was changed to a "four-six" profit sharing, and now most are closed. In addition, shop assistants held meetings, managers set up stalls, shop assistants watched operas, managers cooked, and barbers, baths, operas, toothpaste, and toothbrushes were all provided by the shop owner. When capitalists lost money, closed down, or laid off employees, four procedures had to be followed (worker group discussion, household registration office registration, district trade union approval, and municipal trade union approval), with no freedom to dismiss. The wage regulations for military, machinery, and chemical factories were: calculated in millet, 300 jin per month for the first grade of the third class, 450 jin per month for the first grade of the first class, and 600 jin per month for the first grade of the special class. Apprentices received 150 jin per month. There were also regulations for work clothes (one set per year), work bonuses (one month's salary added for those who did not take leave for a year, three days' salary added for those who did not take leave for a month), and family relief funds. The daily wages for state-owned coal mines were as high as 24 jin of millet. Private factories were forced to raise wages due to pressure from the Party and trade unions. State-owned factories, on the other hand, did not consider costs and competed to hire workers, raising wages infinitely. Workers and shop assistants had high wages, many privileges, and were gluttonous and lazy. Shop owners had the feeling that "hiring a shop assistant is like hiring a biological father."

    (3) Unified control and monopoly. All towns, large and small, had exchanges (which played a good role during the War of Resistance Against Japan). Some charged fees regardless of whether a transaction was made or not. Each district mutually blockaded and imposed heavy taxes. Border tax bureaus, public security bureaus, and military committees confiscated and detained goods at will, deterring merchants from traveling. Merchants had to go through five procedures to obtain a travel permit, with a very short time limit. Those who did not return after the expiration date were not allowed to travel for three months. Many public security officers made a fortune by issuing travel permits. In Xingtai, merchants were forced to change careers, eliminating many specialized trades. Everyone wanted to control things that made money (unified control, unified purchase, unified sale, etc.), and everything that was controlled collapsed. For example, Nanyue, Qingfeng, and Guancheng straw braid, which were sold to Southeast Asia, Britain, and the United States, used to be very profitable. After unified control was implemented, braid merchants stopped coming, products could not be sold, and the braid industry collapsed. In Shuiye Town, Anyang, the handmade cigarette industry was very developed, but after the implementation of the cigarette monopoly, all shops closed.

    (4) Some cities were quite prosperous before liberation, but immediately became desolate after liberation. The industry and commerce in these cities did not collapse because of liquidation and struggle, but because they were巧取豪夺, squeezed out, and forcibly occupied by the production of organs, troops, and organizations. Some used military and political power to oppress people, forcibly occupying shops, factories, and workshops. With the convenience of telephones, automobiles, and armed forces, they had abundant capital (mostly misappropriated public funds and war-seized materials), hoarding and manipulating the market. Some were simply lawless, transporting and selling prohibited goods, and resisting government orders.

    (5) After entering the cities, discipline was extremely poor, and wealth was seized indiscriminately, which was a completely destructive policy. Military industry, supply, health, newspaper offices, various troops, various organs, and production personnel all swarmed in after the city was captured, seizing things indiscriminately. Then the common people followed suit and looted. Any city could be completely destroyed in just two or three days, as happened in Handan, Qinyang, Jiaozuo, Yuncheng, etc. Other factors, such as exorbitant taxes and levies (such as street office fees, service fees, preferential treatment fees, reception fees, Yangko fees, and consolation fees), unfair assessments of business taxes, and soaring prices, can also harm industry and commerce.

    In order to correct the "leftist" errors in industry and commerce, the following decisions are made:

    (1) Strictly prohibit the liquidation and struggle against industry and commerce. Protect all industry and commerce (including that of landlords and rich peasants). Landlords and rich peasants who transfer land property to industry and commerce are welcome and must not be struggled against. Landlords' and rich peasants' handicraft tools, such as spinning wheels, looms, stocking machines, and sewing machines, must not be confiscated or requisitioned, and they are allowed to keep them for production.

    (2) If the industry and commerce of landlords and rich peasants have already been liquidated and struggled against, but have not yet been distributed, or have only been transferred to mass shares (the so-called "changing the deity without changing the temple"), or have been distributed but have not yet been damaged and exhausted, they should be immediately and unconditionally returned to the original owners. If the capital is insufficient, the government will provide low-interest or interest-free loans to ensure that they can continue to operate. The stores and factories of industrialists and businessmen who have fled should be resolutely protected and not infringed upon. After their return, they should still be handed over to the original owners for continued operation. The industry and commerce of true bureaucratic capitalists and the most counter-revolutionary elements should be handled by the border area government or administrative office. No other organs, organizations, or individuals have the right to interfere. After confiscation by the border area government or administrative office, they must not be dispersed and should continue to be operated.

    (3) Trade unions and Party branches should cooperate with factory owners to jointly develop the economy, achieving "sufficient raw materials, low costs, high output, high quality, and wide sales." Currently, high wages must be reduced. Wages should be freely determined by labor and capital. The slogans of increasing wages and reducing working hours should not be raised, but all public and private enterprises are prohibited from feudal or semi-feudal abuse and exploitation of workers, shop assistants, and apprentices. Implement a wage system based on hourly work and piecework. A three-person committee headed by the factory director should be established to lead production, initially implemented in state-owned enterprises. If the capitalists agree, it can also be implemented in private enterprises.

    (4) Overcome the ideas of unified control and monopoly in state-owned enterprises. Stipulate the system and methods for realizing "consideration for both public and private interests, and benefit for both labor and capital" in state-owned enterprises. Operations that are beneficial to both state-owned and private enterprises, or beneficial to state-owned enterprises and harmless or slightly harmful to private enterprises, are allowed. Operations that are beneficial to state-owned enterprises but greatly harmful to private enterprises are not allowed. Economic struggle against the enemy must be managed, but the methods should be as simple as possible. Trade within the liberated areas is completely free. Abolish the travel permit system, abolish or transform exchanges, and abolish the method of controlling the population's departure from villages in rural areas, giving people the freedom to work.

    (5) Banks, the General Trading Company, the Cooperation Department, and the Finance Department should cooperate to吞吐物资 on time, implement annual loans, strongly support production, issue currency step by step according to the season. The main task of the General Trading Company is to 활跃 the market and stabilize prices, and not to bear financial tasks, in order to maintain a steady rise in prices (it is impossible not to rise), and not to暴涨暴跌.

    (6) All organs, troops, factories, and stores must accept the leadership of the local Party committee and government (Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau), abolish their privileges, and be treated equally with private enterprises. Illegal business operations must be strictly prohibited.

    (7) Abolish the exorbitant levies imposed on industry and commerce by local governments. Except for the taxes and apportionments stipulated by the border area government, no other organs or organizations may arbitrarily apportion or increase them. Donations for the military should be voluntary and not apportioned. An income tax of only about 15% of the net profit should be levied on industrialists and businessmen, and a reasonable system for assessing, calculating, and collecting taxes must be stipulated.

    (8) The abolition of all debts stipulated in the Land Law Outline does not include industrial and commercial loans and accounts receivable.

    (9) Promulgate a draft cooperative law, abolish illegal activities of certain cooperatives, stipulate the nature, tasks, and business system of cooperatives, rectify the cooperative ranks, strengthen business guidance, and organize production and adjust materials in a planned way. Banks should provide low-interest loans to those with insufficient capital to help them develop.

    (10) Strengthen education on urban and industrial and commercial policies for troops and local areas.

    (11) In order to implement the above policies, it is decided to convene a region-wide industrial and commercial conference on May 15 to invite representatives from public and private enterprises, chambers of commerce, trade unions, and the government to review past gains and losses and study specific policies for developing industry and commerce in three different types of towns (areas).

    (12) Each district party committee should submit a summary report to the Central Bureau within three months on cities with a population of more than 20,000 in its district, and do a good job in the following cities: Yuncheng, Quwo, Jincheng, Changzhi, Xingtai, Wu'an, Qinyang, Handan, Linqing, Nangong, Hengshui, Daming, Puyang, Liaocheng, Yangji, etc. Jiluyu should also restore办业. Gain experience and promote the whole region.

    中共晋冀鲁豫中央局关于工商业政策的指示
    目前我区工商业情况，大体可分为三类城镇（地区）。
    第一类，原有工商业全部或大部保留并发展了新的工商业，如临清、南宫、衡水、曲沃、曲村等，经济发展，市场繁荣，这一类城镇（地区）约占全区城镇（地区）四分之一。
    第二类，原有工商业大部或小部垮台，新的工商业亦有部分发展，如邯郸、晋城、阳邑（武安属）、河南店（涉县属）等，这一类城镇（地区），约占全区城镇（地区）四分之一。
    第三类，原有工商业大部或全部垮台，新的工商业又很少发展，如武安、大名、闻喜等，这一类城镇（地区）约占全区城镇（地区）四分之二。
    工商业被破坏而又不能迅速恢复，除客观原因（如战争影响与国民党反动政策所加于我的影响等）外，政策方面值得提出检讨的有如下五条：
    （一）反奸清算时，奸、霸、特务、官僚资本等定义含混不明，没有明确地严格地区别哪些商店工厂才算是汉奸恶霸官僚资本，才可以清算没收，哪些应予保护，大大伤害了工商业。土改中斗争了工商业，是没有明确分开资本主义与封建主义的界限，而有些人认为工商业均带封建性，不斗争工商业，就不能肃清封建，就不能满足群众要求，如长治南大街，把中等商人全部斗垮，邢台、邯郸、晋城、武安、沁阳都是在这一界限不分，笼统封建的名词下斗垮的。
    （二）高工资政策，工人运动一般是盲目的从工人眼前福利出发，未考虑工运政策，工厂商店关门对工人有利，抑经济发展了对工人有利？未考虑。抗战中太行有不管什么工人，工资要维持养活一个半人的规定。日本投降后，邢台工人店员年工资均在三十万元（冀币）以上，同盛铁工厂，年工资三十三万元外还要倒三七分红，义兴盛商号资金五十万元，雇店员二人，一参军，拥护二十二万元，一娶妻，帮助三十二万元，妻衣食住行由店东长期供给，工资照发。武安店员工资日十五斤小米。彭城磁业工人工资日十八斤小米，资方付不起工资，改成倒“四六分货”，现大部歇业。此外店员开会、经理摆摊，店员看戏、经理做饭，理发、洗澡、看戏、牙膏、牙刷均由店东供给，资方赔垮关门解雇时，须经四道手续（工人小组讨论，户籍室登记，区工会通过，市工会批准），无自由解雇权。军工、机械与化学厂，工资规定：按小米计三等一级者，月三百斤，一等一级者，月四百五十斤，特等一级者，月六百斤，学徒月一百五十斤，另有工服（年各一套）奖工（一年不请假者，加一月工资，一月不请假者，加三天工资），家属救济费等规章。公营煤矿日工资有高至二十四斤小米者。民营工厂受党和工会压迫不得不提高工资。公营工厂则是不计成本，竞雇工人，无限提高工资。工人店员工资高，特权多，好吃懒做。店东有“雇下店员，好比请下亲爹”的感慨。
    （三）统制垄断，大小市镇均有交易所（抗战中起过好作用），有些不管成交与否，皆得交费。各区相互封锁征重税，边地税局公安局武委会等机关，乱没收乱扣押，商旅裹足不前。商人外出须经五道手续，始能领到路条，限期很短，过期不归者三个月不准外出，不少公安员，借开路条发财。邢台强制商人转业，很多专行消灭。赚钱的东西都想统制（统制、统买、统卖等），统制了的东西一律垮台，如南乐、清丰、观城草帽辫，行销南洋英美等地，往年获利颇厚，实行统制后，辫商不来了，产品出不去，辫业垮台。安阳水冶镇，手工卷烟甚发达，实行纸烟专制后，全部关门。
    （四）有些城市解放前尚相当繁荣，解放后即跟着萧条下来，这些城市的工商业不是因为清算斗争而垮台，而是被机关、部队、团体的生产巧取豪夺、排挤强占而垮台。他们有些借军事政治力量压人，强占铺面工场作坊，有电话汽车武装的便利，资本雄厚（多为挪用公款战争缴获物资），囤积居奇，操纵市场，有些简直是无法无天，运销违禁品，抗拒政府法令。
    （五）攻入城市后，纪律极坏，乱抓资财，完全是毁灭政策，军工、供给、卫生、报馆各部队各机关各团体生产人员，当城市攻下后亦蜂拥而入，乱抓东西，接着就是老百姓起来跟着抢，任何城市只要有两三天功夫就可破坏干净，如邯郸、沁阳、焦作、运城等就是这样破坏了的。他如苛捐杂税（如市街办公费、支差费、优抗费、招待费、秧歌费、慰劳费等），营业税评议不公，物价暴涨暴跌，均可伤害工商业。
    为了纠正工商业中的左倾错误，特作出如下决定：
    （一）严格禁止清算斗争工商业。保护一切工商业（包括地主富农工商业在内）。地主富农将土地财产转入工商业者，一律欢迎，不准斗争。地主富农的手工工具，如纺车、织布机、织袜机、缝纫机、弹花机等，一律不没收不征收，准其留下进行生产。
    （二）地主富农工商业如已被清算斗争，但尚未分配，或仅转作群众股份（所谓换神不换庙），或虽已分配而尚未损坏耗光者，均应立即无条件的退还原业主，资本不足者，政府给以低利或无利贷款，务使其能继续经营。工商业主逃亡者，其商店工厂应坚决保护，不准侵犯，俟其归来后，仍交还原业主继续经营。真正官僚资本与最反革命分子的工商业，归边区政府或行署处理，其他任何机关团体与个人，无权过问，边府行署没收后亦不得分散，应继续经营。
    （三）工会、党的支部应与厂主合作，共同发展经济，做到“原料足，成本低，产量多，质量高，销路广”。目前高工资必须压低，工资由劳资双方自由规定，不提增加工资减少工时的口号，但所有公私企业均禁止对工人店员学徒进行封建半封建性的虐待和剥削。实行按时计工，按件给资的工资制。成立以厂长为首的三人委员会领导生产，首在公营企业中实行，私人企业如资方同意，亦可实行。
    （四）克服国营企业中的统制垄断思想，规定国营企业中实现“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的制度和办法，凡对国营和民营均有利、或对国营有利对民营无害或害很少者允许经营，凡对国营有利而对民营害大者一概不允许经营。对敌经济斗争必须实行管理，但办法则应力求简便，解放区内贸易完全自由，取消路条制，取消或改造交易所，取消农村管制人口出村办法，给人民以就业的自由。
    （五）银行、贸易总公司、合作厅、财政厅，共同合作，按时吞吐物资，实行全年贷款，大力支持生产，按季节有步骤的发行货币，贸易总公司主要任务为活跃市场平稳物价，不担负财政任务，以便保持物价平稳上升（不上升亦不可能），不暴涨暴跌。
    （六）一切机关部队工厂商店，必须接受当地党委与政府（工商管理局）的领导，取消其特权，与民营企业同等待遇，严厉取缔非法营业。
    （七）取缔地方上所加于工商业的苛杂，除边府所规定的税收摊派外，其他任何机关团体不得擅自摊派或增派，劳军捐款应出自愿，不得摊派。对工商业者按所得纯利只征百分之十五左右的所得税并须规定合理评议计算征收的制度。
    （八）土地法大纲所规定的废除一切债务，不包括工商业的借贷来往帐及货帐在内。
    （九）颁发合作社条例草案，取缔某些合作社非法行为，规定合作社性质任务与营业制度，整顿合作社队伍，加强业务指导，有计划组织生产，调剂物资，其资本不足者由银行给以低利贷款，帮助其发展。
    （十）加强部队与地方的城市政策与工商业政策的教育。
    （十一）为贯彻上述方针，决定五月十五日召开全区工商业会议，邀集公私企业、商会、工会及政府的代表，检讨过去得失，研究三种不同城镇（地区）发展工商业的具体政策。
    （十二）各区党委应把本区两万人以上城市，三个月内做出总结报告中央局，并作好下列城市的工作：运城、曲沃、晋城、长治、邢台、武安、沁阳、邯郸、临清、南宫、衡水、大名、濮阳、聊城、杨集等。冀鲁豫并应恢复办业。取得经验，推动全区。
