Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E, 18th: The merchants of Gong County, newly liberated along the Longhai Railway, are accusing Chiang's bandits of their looting crimes during their occupation. A vendor named Liu Yanzhou said that his stall was set up with a capital of 8 million, but Chiang's 38th Division, upon passing through, robbed him of 23 cartons of cigarettes, resulting in a loss of 5 million yuan. Yongtai Trading Company had 400 catties of grain stolen, and two shop assistants were forcibly conscripted. A vegetable peddler from Caogou in the town was stripped of his vegetables by the defeated soldiers of the 124th Brigade, who burned his basket for firewood and also seized him for conscription. In just half a month, more than 100 apprentices from various shops were seized. The county originally had 300 vendors, but now there are less than 100 left. Prices have skyrocketed. In mid-March, wheat was 170,000 to 190,000 yuan per dou (30 jin), pork was 20,000 yuan per jin, and salt was 24,000 yuan per jin. By the end of the month, wheat had risen to 1.3 million yuan, pork to 80,000 yuan, and salt to 120,000 yuan. The market in the city has gradually recovered since liberation.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 18th: When a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army entered the Fenyang area, which was being harassed by Yan's bandits, the masses in the villages along the way tearfully recounted the crimes of Yan's bandits, arousing the soldiers' vengeful anger on behalf of the suffering people. In Hanjia Yuan Village, every household was looted clean by Yan's bandits; pots and jars were smashed, doors and windows were burned, people were scarce, and many of the elderly and weak were groaning in pain on their beds or weeping against the walls. In Shanzhuangtou Village, the corpses of peasants killed by Yan's bandits lay strewn about, and many soldiers shed tears as they listened to the masses recounting their ordeals. Soldier Sun Liuyou said, "Wherever the higher-ups point, we will fight, and we will avenge the people to the end." During a march, the Sixth Company encountered fleeing peasants who tearfully recounted that under Yan's bandits' "confession and rebirth" tyranny, their entire family of ten had been scattered, their fates unknown. He himself had escaped but was captured by Yan's bandits, beaten into a cripple, and begged the soldiers to avenge him. The company immediately launched a campaign of recounting suffering. Yang Zijun, a liberated soldier from the Ninth Squad, said, "My family is just like that refugee." The entire squad then formulated plans to kill the enemy and perform meritorious deeds, and their hatred for the enemy was unprecedentedly heightened. Although the unit ate chaff and wild herbs during frequent combat marches, sharing hardships with the masses, they had no complaints. Some soldiers gave their only dry rations to the peasants. On the 13th, when the training regiment of Yan's bandits' 70th Division robbed grain from the villages of Yuan Tou, 30 li west of Fenyang, all the soldiers bravely pursued the enemy, annihilating more than 150 of them, and returned the ten thousand jin of grain and fourteen head of livestock they had seized to the suffering people.

　　巩县商民控诉蒋匪汾阳群众痛恨阎贼
    【新华社豫陕鄂十八日电】陇海路新解放的巩县商民，纷纷控诉蒋匪盘踞时的抢劫罪行。摊贩刘延洲说他的摊子是八百万资本置起来的，蒋匪三十八师一过，抢走了他的二十三条纸烟，损失达五百万元。永泰行被抢走了四百斤粮食，两个伙计被抓去当兵。城关曹沟的一个买菜小贩，被溃匪一二四旅把菜吃光，筐子烧火，人也抓去当兵。仅半个月来各商店学徒就被抓走一百多人。该县原有摊贩三百家，现在只剩下不到百家。物价狂涨，三月中旬小麦每斗（三十市斤）十七万至十九万元，猪肉每斤两万元，食盐每斤两万四千元，但至月底小麦涨至一百三十万元，猪肉涨至八万元，食盐涨至十二万元。该城解放后市面已逐渐恢复中。
    【新华社晋绥十八日电】解放军某部进入阎匪侵扰之汾阳地区时，沿途各村群众纷纷哭诉阎匪罪行，激起战士为受难人民复仇怒火。韩家垣村家家被阎匪抢劫一空，锅缸被揭碎，门窗被烧光，人烟绝少，不少老弱受伤者卧炕呻吟，或依墙悲哭。山庄头村被阎匪杀死的农民尸体横躺着，不少战士们听到群众叙述遭难的经过时，眼泪涌流。战士孙六有说：“上级指到哪里，打到哪里，为人民报仇干到底。”六连行军中遇到逃难农民哭诉在阎匪“自白转生”暴政下，全家十口人已妻离子散，生死不明，自己逃出又被阎匪抓住，打成残废，要求战士为他报仇。该连即借此展开诉苦，九班解放战士杨子俊说：“我家和那难民一样”。全班遂订出杀敌立功计划，敌忾心空前提高。该部虽在频繁战斗行军中吃糠咽菜，与群众共甘苦，均毫无怨言。有的战士将仅有的干粮送给农民。十三日阎匪七十师补训团向汾阳西三十里之源头等村抢粮时，全体战士奋勇追击敌人，歼灭敌百五十余，并将夺回之万斤粮食，和十四头牲畜交还受难人民。
