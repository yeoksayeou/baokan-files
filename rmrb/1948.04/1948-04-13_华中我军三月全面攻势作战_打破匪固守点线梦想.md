Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th – Branch reporter summarized the comprehensive offensive operation launched by Central China against Chiang bandits in March (February 25th to March 25th), annihilating more than 15,800 enemies, and recovering the two cities of Shuyang and Funing, as well as more than 40 towns and villages including Yilin and Lvsi, and vast areas. The offensive began with the victorious breakthrough operation on the Grand Canal line between Gao (you) Bao (ying) and Huai (an) in late February. At that time, the Chiang bandits were piecing together their reorganized 4th Division and reorganized 51st Division to form a so-called "Pursuit and Suppression Column," advancing northward from Dongtai along the (Nan) Tong (Gan) Yu line, attempting to control the main points and lines in Central China. The battle on the Grand Canal line forced the bandit "Pursuit and Suppression Column" to hurriedly return west to provide reinforcements. At the same time, the Liberation Army advanced rapidly into Huainan, successively capturing key towns such as Tongcheng and Gucheng on February 26th and March 3rd, liberating vast areas between Tianchang and Xuyi, and on the 9th, defeating five regiments of the bandit's "retaliatory suppression," annihilating nearly 2,000 enemies in succession. The military and civilians in Central Jiangsu and Northern Jiangsu also launched offensives simultaneously. On the southern front, they successively captured key strongholds such as Anfeng, Fu'an, Liangdu along the Hai (an) Dong (tai) line, and Magou along the Hai (an) Tai (xian) line, annihilating more than 1,000 enemies, with the vanguard directly approaching the outskirts of Dongtai City. On the northern front, our army suddenly appeared behind the Chiang bandits in the vast area east of Lianghuai, between the Yunyan River and the Sheyang River, recovering Shuyang City on the 6th and Funing City on the 11th. The defending bandits scurried away overnight. Just as the Chiang bandits were losing their souls and their deployments were in chaos, our army launched a powerful offensive in Northern Jiangsu, Central Jiangsu, and Northern Huai simultaneously. From March 16th to 19th, the Northern Jiangsu army completely annihilated the reorganized 51st Division's 113th Brigade (missing the 339th Regiment) of fleeing bandits from Funing in Yilin Town, 70 miles southwest of Funing, and defeated the bandits who came to the aid of Lianghuai from the east, annihilating more than 6,000 of them. The Central Jiangsu army continued to develop eastward and southward from the Haidong line, successively capturing key towns such as Juegang, the terminus of the Ru (gao) Jue (gang) line, and Shigang and Sanyu in Nantong, annihilating more than 3,000 bandits, and recovering the famous coastal fishing port of Lvsi Town. The local armed forces in Northern Huai advanced into the east of Sixian City, successively capturing strongholds such as Qingyang, Shangtang, and Zhengji, annihilating more than 1,900 bandits. The local armed forces of the First Sub-district of Central Jiangsu captured strongholds such as Yaojiadai and Shidai on the Cheng (Taixing) Huang (qiao) line, annihilating more than 600 bandits, and took advantage of the victory to recover 12 outposts around Taixing City. The local armed forces of the Northern Jiangsu Huaihai Sub-district launched a large-scale campaign to suppress local Chiang bandits, successively recovering Zhuma north of Lianshui City and Nanjingjian on the Su (qian) Xin (Anzhen) line. The Chiang bandits were beaten everywhere, panicking and fleeing in terror. When the Shuyang defending bandits fled for their lives, they abandoned more than 30 various artillery pieces. More than 30 people were drowned while trying to cross the Sheyang River, and when the commander of the Funing defending bandit regiment fled, he didn't even have time to take his pistol and documents.
This glorious victory in the offensive shattered the Chiang bandits' dream of maintaining the main points and lines in Central China. The Tongyu, Haitai, Rujue, Chenghuang, and Suxin lines have been largely controlled or cut off by us. The vast area along the coast, from the mouth of the Yangtze River to Chenjiagang south of the Longhai Railway, a total length of more than 800 li, is now free of bandits. Tianchang, Xuyi, Lianshui, Huaiyin, Dongtai, Rugao, Nantong and other cities are directly under the spearhead of the Liberation Army's offensive. Now the Chiang bandits are vainly attempting to implement the so-called "total war," carrying out "destructive sweeping" and creating "no-man's land" in a desperate struggle. Our military and civilians in Central China are closely watching their conspiracies and poisonous plans, determined to completely crush them, and further annihilate the bandit army in Central China to win even greater victories.

　　华中我军三月全面攻势作战
  　打破匪固守点线梦想
    【新华社华东十一日电】分社记者综述华中三月（二月二十五日至三月二十五日）对蒋匪发动全面攻势作战，歼敌一万五千八百余名，收复沭阳、阜宁两城及益林、吕四等四十余市镇与广大地区之经过称：攻势以二月下旬运河线高（邮）宝（应）淮（安）间之胜利破击战为序幕，当时蒋匪正拚凑其整四师、整五十一师组成所谓“追剿纵队”，自东台沿（南）通（赣）榆线北犯，企图控制华中主要点线。运河线之战，迫使匪“追剿纵队”慌忙向西回援。与此同时，解放军长驱挺进淮南，二月二十六及三月三日连下铜城、古城等重镇，解放天长、盱眙间广大地区，并于九日击溃匪五个团的“报复扫荡”，先后歼敌近二千名。苏中、苏北军民亦同时展开攻势，南线连克海（安）东（台）线重镇安丰、富安、梁垛及海（安）泰（县）线马沟等据点，歼敌一千余名，前锋直逼东台城郊。北线我军则突然出现于蒋匪背后两淮以东、运盐河及射阳河间广大地区，六日收复沭阳城，十一日收复阜宁城，守匪连夜鼠窜。正当蒋匪丧魂落魄，部署混乱之际，我军复于苏北、苏中、淮北同时展开强大攻势。苏北我军三月十六至十九日全歼阜宁逃匪整五十一师一一三旅（缺三三九团）于阜宁西南七十里之益林镇，并击溃由两淮东援之匪，共歼其六千余名。苏中我军自海东线继续向东向南发展，连下如（皋）掘（港）线终点掘港及南通之石港、三余等重镇，歼匪三千余名，并收复沿海著名渔港吕四镇。淮北地方武装挺进泗县城东，连克清阳、上塘、郑集等据点，歼匪一千九百余名。苏中一分区地方武装则于城（泰兴）黄（桥）线攻克姚家埭、失逮等据点，歼匪六百余名，并乘胜收复泰兴城外围据点十二处。苏北淮海分区地方武装则大举进剿土蒋，先后收复涟水城北之朱码及宿（迁）新（安镇）线上之南涧等地。蒋匪到处挨打，仓惶惊窜。沭阳守匪逃命时，丢下各种炮三十多门，因争渡射阳河被挤下水淹死三十余人，而阜宁守匪团长逃跑时，连手枪文件亦均未及带走。
    这次攻势的光辉胜利，打破了蒋匪企图保持华中各主要点线的梦想，通榆、海泰、如掘、城黄、宿新等线已被我大部控制或切断，沿海由长江口直至陇海路南陈家港，全长八百余里广大地区已无匪踪。天长、盱眙、涟水、淮阴、东台、如皋、南通等城，已直接处在解放军攻势的矛头之下，现蒋贼妄图实施所谓“总体战”，进行“毁灭扫荡”与制造“无人区”，作垂死挣扎。我华中军民正严密注视其阴谋毒计，决予以彻底粉碎，并进一步全歼华中匪军，争取更伟大的胜利。
