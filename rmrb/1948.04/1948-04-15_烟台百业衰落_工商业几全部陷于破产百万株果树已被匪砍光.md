Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. The Tianjin Yishibao reported on the 18th of last month that under the tyrannical rule of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, Yantai's industries have declined and the citizens' suffering has intensified. According to the Chiang Kai-shek municipal government, more than 300 businesses have recently closed down. The remaining businesses are struggling to survive because of the heavy and miscellaneous taxes of 80 million to 100 million yuan in Chiang Kai-shek currency per month, and they are all facing a deep crisis. The handmade lace and hairnet industries, which used to have more than 30 companies directly exporting and at least 30,000 female workers making a living by hand, have all been shut down. Yantai was originally a famous fruit production area, with more than 40 large orchards and no less than one million fruit trees in the city. Now, all the fruit trees have been chopped down by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Due to power shortages, most of the city's industries have been shut down. Prices have risen sharply, and the average price of various daily necessities such as rice, flour, and vegetables is twice as high as in Beijing and Tianjin. Ordinary citizens are forced to fill their stomachs with peanut cakes and bean cakes, which were previously used to feed livestock. Hungry citizens are still suffering from the looting and extortion of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. The troops enter civilian homes at will, go through the halls and rooms, and rob citizens of their furniture and other property. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's "new recruits" who came from Qingdao, because they are not getting enough to eat every day, run to the homes of citizens to steal food. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities are also frantically carrying out conscription, stipulating that citizens aged 18 to 65 are not allowed to leave the country, and will conscript 20,000 people in Yantai. The Chiang Kai-shek troops in the city are afraid of the People's Liberation Army and impose a "curfew" at 8 pm every night. The police often carry guns over the walls and enter civilian homes late at night, extorting money under the pretext of "checking household registration."

　　烟台百业衰落
  　工商业几全部陷于破产百万株果树已被匪砍光
    【新华社陕北十三日电】津益世报上月十八日载烟台通讯透露：在蒋匪军暴虐统治下，烟台百业衰落，市民困苦日甚。据蒋匪市府发表，最近歇业的商号，已在三百家以上，现尚在勉强支撑的一般商号，亦因每家每月须负担蒋币八千万元至一亿元的繁重苛杂，均已面临深重危机。花边发网等手工业，过去有三十多家公司直接出口，靠手工为生的女工至少有三万人，目前均全部停业。烟市原为著名水果出产地，大果园全市共有四十余家，各种果树不下百万株，现所有果树已被蒋匪军砍伐殆尽。市内工业因缺电，几已全部停工。物价剧烈上涨，各种生活必需品如米面菜等平均价格均高出平津一倍。一般市民被迫以往昔喂牲畜的花生饼，豆饼充饥。饥饿市民尚饱受蒋匪军的抢劫勒索，匪军随便出入民宅，穿堂入室，劫走市民床桌家具等财物。近由青岛开来的蒋匪“新兵”，每日因吃不饱饭，便跑到市民家里抢吃食物。蒋匪当局并疯狂进行抓丁，规定十八岁至六十五岁的市民一律不许出境，将在烟市抓丁两万。市内蒋匪军因害怕人民解放军，晚上八时即“戒严”。匪警常深夜携枪逾墙进入民宅，借“查户口”之名实行勒索。
