Column: Discussion and Research

    Recently, we have received many letters from readers raising various questions about land reform, which we think is very good. Some questions were asked by several readers simultaneously, indicating that they represent the thoughts and understanding of some cadres, Party members, and the masses. Now we plan to use a certain amount of space to answer those questions that are more common. We hope everyone will continue to raise questions, but they must be specific and clear. The answers here may not be entirely correct, and everyone can raise further opinions for discussion and research.
    Is it appropriate to resolve conflicts during Party rectification? To Comrade Wang Xing from Shahe, forwarded by the editor:
    Comrade Wang Xing believes in his letter that "during Party rectification, a few Party members with major mistakes and individual criminals should be subjected to disciplinary sanctions and legal processing according to the severity of their mistakes." Therefore, he feels that the approach of "resolving conflicts" in Tian Erzhuang is inappropriate. However, we believe that the Central Committee has pointed out: "In general branches, there are always some good Party members. The responsibility of the higher-level leaders lies in being good at discovering good Party members and relying on them as the backbone, absorbing fresh forces, and transforming the branch, rather than abandoning or ignoring them. The rectification of the Party and cadres must adopt a serious and cautious attitude. We must not only seriously pay attention to the impure phenomena within the Party, but also not forget that the overall situation of our Party has already undergone long-term tests, has great prestige among the masses, and is advancing victoriously." The Tian Erzhuang branch fits this condition. Since the establishment of the Party in 1941, it has undergone seven years of testing in the three major movements of fighting against the enemy, reducing rent and interest, and land reform. Under the leadership of the Party, it has contributed to the people and done work. Land reform has basically completed its tasks. This time, only four households needed to have land adjusted. There are many good Party members, and few bad Party members, with only one or two with major mistakes. The biggest problem of the entire branch is an undemocratic style of work. In our Party rectification work, on the one hand, we boldly mobilize the masses. In the meetings combining Party members and non-Party masses, the non-Party masses participating in the meeting can fully criticize and examine Party members; on the other hand, we rely on good Party members as the backbone to carry out serious criticism within the Party and make profound reflections at the meetings. After the criticism of the branch meeting, the approval of the poor peasant league, the reflection and criticism of the Party members and non-Party masses in the general meeting, the opinions of the masses on the Party members were almost completely raised, the anger was almost completely vented, and the conflicts between the Party and the masses were resolved. After the supplementary land distribution, the Party members showed that they were active, responsible, and had good methods, the opinions left over by the masses were forgiven under the awareness that "we are one family, and it is good to be able to change." Finally, another general meeting of Party members and non-Party masses was held, allowing the masses to put forward any unexpressed opinions and how to deal with Party members who made mistakes; at the same time, Party members were allowed to state the nature and responsibility of their mistakes, and to distinguish any misunderstandings or inaccuracies in the opinions raised by the masses. The masses felt that they had vented their anger, and the Party members had corrected their mistakes, expressing satisfaction; the Party members also felt that the masses were tolerant and saved them, and were also very happy. Therefore, in the end, the masses said about the public security officer who injured people: "He was for the work, just overdid it, it is good to be able to change." The punishment was greatly reduced (the first time the masses suggested expulsion from the Party, this time they suggested probation within the Party for two to four months). The punishment in that situation both educated the Party members and educated the masses, bringing the relationship between the Party and the masses a step closer, and it can also be said that the big conflict between the Party and the masses was resolved. In short, in dealing with Party members during Party rectification, we adopted three principles: striving for education and transformation, objectively distinguishing right from wrong and the severity of mistakes, and being strict but also pointing out the way out. Therefore, we both mobilized the masses and saved the Party members. This is different from the spirit of punitivism and is in line with the Central Committee's "2/22" instructions. Otherwise, left-leaning deviations will inevitably occur. However, attention must be paid to the approach. Talking about resolving conflicts as soon as you arrive in the village may affect the masses' willingness to express their opinions. We initially encouraged the masses to speak boldly and say anything, and later proposed to resolve conflicts. The masses accepted it, but if we emphasize handing over to the people's court at the beginning, it will leave difficulties for the future transformation of the relationship between the masses and the Party. I don't know if this is right, I hope you will study it further.

    Regarding the problem of the masses settling accounts in Tian Erzhuang? To Comrade Zhang Zhi, forwarded by the editor:
    Regarding the issue of settling accounts, the masses are very concerned and have elected special personnel to carry it out seriously. We let the masses settle the accounts freely, knowing that it is impossible to settle them clearly, but we have to let them settle them. However, we must pay attention to the following: First, Yang Yunfeng, the political director of Tian Erzhuang, is illiterate, so the accounts are unclear, and due to the past lack of democracy, the accounts were lost. Second, the masses have a misconception, which is to distribute the fruits of a few landlords and rich peasants to the majority of peasants in the whole village. Everyone feels that the landlords have a lot of things, and they get very little. Therefore, they replace facts with feelings and speculations. For example, if they say that a target of struggle has a pair of silver bracelets, then there may be dozens more? Knowing that the accounts are lost, they use this as an excuse to achieve the purpose of asking for things in the name of asking for accounts. We have noticed this point, and during the supplementary distribution, we have gradually answered the questions of the masses in fact by letting the masses settle accounts and accepting the excessive fruits withdrawn by the cadres. However, individual extremely selfish people, such as Yang Xiangzi, are still encouraging the masses to settle accounts, and some of the masses have been fooled. The specific manifestation is that at the last general meeting of peasant association members, when discussing settling accounts, only one group out of the three groups was splitting hairs. That group was created under the control of Yang Xiangzi. At this time, our working group raised the issue. The masses in that group saw through Yang Xiangzi's intentions and ignored his opinions, and turned around. Here, we want to answer Comrade Zhang Zhi's questions: First, is the turn fast? We can definitely answer that it is not fast. Because from the point of time, it has been almost a month from settling accounts to this meeting; from the point of view of the opinions of the masses, the vast majority of the masses agree that the problem is solved "automatically." Second, is it a substitution for the masses? We also deny this. Because the demands of the majority of the masses are no longer that they must settle accounts and ask for money, only individual selfish people are manipulating public opinion; at this time, the responsibility of the leadership lies in exposing the attempts of such people, so that the masses can recognize their true colors and express their true opinions. This is true democracy, which meets the requirements of the broad masses and follows the mass line. Otherwise, things will be plunged into chaos, forming a "dictatorship" of individual selfish people, and the leaders will commit the error of tailism. As for whether it is better for the working group to come forward? Or is it better to inspire other masses to raise questions? That depends on the conditions at that time and place. Third, why does "automatic" need to be approved by the higher authorities? We believe that approval by the higher authorities is necessary, because with the establishment of a new style of work, in the future, the general way to deal with internal problems of the peasants will be to adopt criticism and self-criticism, and resolve conflicts, to achieve the general goal of democracy and unity. For this reason, the leadership must resolutely oppose the old style of feudal society with material punishment. If it is absolutely necessary to impose a penalty, it must be agreed by the entire masses, and it must be approved by the higher authorities. The result of the penalty must achieve the purpose of educating the person concerned and educating the masses, and resolutely oppose the punitiveism of landlords towards peasants and warlords towards soldiers. Yang Yunfeng's "automatic" settlement of accounts is a question of this nature, and it is at the beginning of the establishment of a new style of work at the end of the Party rectification, so it must be approved by the higher authorities. If the policy is violated, the higher authorities should not approve it, which is also a concrete way of policy education, not pouring cold water.
    In addition, regarding the transformation of the relationship between Duan Kuishan, Yang Eryou, and the masses, please see the above reply to Comrade Wang Xing. Duan's compensation to Meng Quezi was because Meng Quezi took the initiative not to want it.　　　　　　（Tian Erzhuang Working Group）

### 整党中提解疙瘩是不是合适？

专栏：讨论与研究

    近来我们接到不少读者来信，对于土地改革各方面提出了许多的问题，我们认为很好。有些问题，同时有好几个读者写信来问，可见代表了一部分干部、党员、群众的思想和认识。现在我们打算以一定的篇幅来答复那些带有较普遍性的问题，希望大家有问题继续提出来，但一定要写得具体、明确。这里的答复不见得尽对，大家如有意见，也还可以再提出来讨论和研究。
    整党中提解疙瘩是不是合适？编辑同志转沙河王兴同志：
    王兴同志的来信认为“整党中有少数错误大的党员及个别犯罪分子，还要依其错误轻重分别受到纪律制裁及法律处理。”因此，觉得田二庄解疙瘩的提法不合适。但我们认为，中央曾指出：“一般支部，总有若干好党员。上级领导者的责任，就在善于发现好党员，并依靠他们为骨干，吸收新鲜力量，改造支部，而不要抛弃或不理他们。整党整干，必须采取严肃而又谨慎的态度。我们既要严肃地注视党内不纯的现象，又要勿忘我党的整个情况是业已经过长期考验，在群众中有了极大威信，并正在胜利前进中”。田二庄的支部正合乎这个条件，自四一年建党以来，在对敌斗争，减租减息，土地改革三次大运动中，经过了七年的考验，在党的领导下，为人民出了力做了工作，土地改革基本上完成了任务，这次平分，只有四户抽补土地。好党员多，坏党员少，错误大者仅一两人。全支部最大的毛病是作风不民主。我们在整党工作上，一方面放手发动群众，在党员与党外群众相结合的大会上，使参加会议的党外群众能够尽情的批判与审查党员；另方面，我们依靠好党员为骨干，在党内开展严肃的批评，在大会上作深刻的反省。这样经过支部会的批评、贫农团的通过，党员与党外群众大会上的反省与批评，群众对党员的意见差不多提完了，气愤差不多出尽了，党与群众之间的疙瘩解开头了。再经在抽补工作中，党员表现积极负责，有办法，群众遗留下的意见也就在“一家人，能改就行”的觉悟下面原谅了他们。最后再开一次党员与党外群众的大会，让群众提出未提完的意见及对犯错误的党员如何处分；同时让党员将犯错误的性质责任加以申述，并对群众所提意见有误会者不符合事实者加以辨别。群众感到自己出了气，党员改了过，表示满意；党员也感到群众宽大，挽救了自己，也很愉快。所以，最后群众对于打伤人的公安员都说：“他是为了工作，就是过了火，能改就行”。处分大大减轻（第一次群众建议开除党籍，这次建议留党察看二至四个月）。在那样情形下的处分，既教育了党员，也教育了群众，使党与群众的关系密切了一步，也可说解开了党与群众之间的大疙瘩。总之，在整党中对待党员，我们采取了三条方针，争取教育改造，客观的分别是非轻重，严厉而又指出其出路。因此，既发动了群众，又挽救了党员。这是和惩办主义的精神不一样的，是合乎中央二、二二指示原则的，否则必然会发生左倾的偏向。不过在做法上必须注意，一到村就谈解疙瘩，可能影响群众不敢提意见，我们在开始是鼓励群众大胆提，啥也可以说，后来才提出了解疙瘩，群众是接受的，但如果一开始动不动就强调交人民法庭处理，也会使将来转变群众与党的关系时留下困难，不知对否，望加研究。

    关于田二庄群众算帐问题？编者转张治同志：
    关于算帐的问题，群众都很关心，选举专人认真进行，我们放手让群众算，明知算不清，也只好让他们算。但是必须注意，第一、田二庄政治主任杨云峰一字不识，因此帐目弄不清，又由于过去不民主，把帐弄丢了。第二、群众有一个错觉，就是把少数地主富农的果实，分散给全村大多数的农民，大家都感到地主东西很多，自己所得很少。因之，以感想猜测代替事实，如说一个斗争对象有一付银镯子，那就可能还有几十付呢？明知帐目丢了，他们借题发挥，以要帐算帐之名，达到要东西之目的。我们注意到此点，在抽补当中，一面让群众算帐，一面接受干部退出的多得果实，逐渐从事实上解答了群众的疑问。但是个别极端自私自利的人如杨祥子等，还在鼓励群众算帐，部分群众上了当，具体的表现是最后一次农会会员大会上，讨论算帐时，三组人只有一组钻牛角尖，那一组就是在杨祥子操纵之下造成的。这时我们工作组提出问题，该组群众看透了杨祥子的意见，便不管他的意见，而转过弯子来。在此要答复张治同志的问题：第一、是否转的快？我们肯定回答不快。因为从时间上看，——从算帐到这次会，将近一个月了；从群众意见看，绝大部分群众同意“自动”点解决了问题。第二、是否包办代替？我们也是否定的答复。因为大多数群众的要求已不是非算帐要钱不可，只有个别的自私自利分子操纵民意；这时候，领导上的责任在于揭发这种人的企图，使群众认识他的真面目，发挥自己的真正意见。这才是真民主，才符合广大群众的要求，才是群众路线。否则就把事情陷于混乱状态，形成个别自私自利者的“专政”，领导者就犯了尾巴主义的错误。至于是工作组出面好呢？还是启发别的群众提出问题好呢？那就看当时当地的条件来决定了。第三、为什么“自动”又要上级批准？我们认为经上级批准是必须的，因为，有了建立新作风，今后处理农民内部问题，一般的采取批评与自我批评，解疙瘩的方式，达到民主团结的总目标。为此，领导上要坚决反对物质处罚的封建社会的旧作风。万不得已，非罚不可时，一则必须全体群众同意，再则必须经上级批准，罚的结果又必须达到教育当事人与教育群众的目的，坚决反对地主对农民、军阀对士兵的惩办主义。杨云峰算帐“自动”是这样性质的问题，又是在整党刚刚结束，建立新作风的开始，故一定经过上级批准。如果违犯了政策，上级应不加批准，那也是政策教育的具体办法，不是泼冷水。
    些外，关于段魁山、杨二友与群众关系的转变，请看上面对王兴同志的答复。段赔偿孟缺子是孟缺子主动不要的。　　　　　　（田二庄工作组）
