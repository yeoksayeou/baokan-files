　　One Week's Battle Situation
　　April 8th to 14th

　　On the southern front, the Yu-Shaan-E and Su-Lu-Yu-Wan People's Liberation Army continued to launch offensives in the vast areas along both sides of the Longhai and Pinghan Railways. From the 5th to the 11th, they successively liberated and recaptured 19 county towns, including Luoyang, Yanshi, Gongxian, Sishui, Xingyang, Xinzheng, Xuchang, Linying, Yancheng, Queshan, Yuxian, Mixian, Dengfeng, Weichuan, Changge, Yanling, Runan, Shangcai, and Suiping, as well as more than ten important towns and military strongholds such as Heishiguan, Huimiao Town, Xiaoyi Town, Hulaoguan, Luohe, and Zhumadian. In the recapture of Luoyang, the entire 371st Regiment of the enemy's 124th Brigade, totaling more than 2,200 men, was annihilated. Local bandits who failed to escape in various places were also completely wiped out; in Runan alone, more than 300 were captured. We now control more than 400 miles of the Longhai Railway from Mianchi in the west to Zhengzhou in the east, and more than 300 miles of the Pinghan Railway from south of Zhengzhou to north of Luohe, and between Queshan and Zhumadian.

　　On the northern front, the Jin-Cha-Ji, Northwest, Jin-Sui, and Ji-Cha-Re-Liao People's Liberation Army launched widespread offensives in the three provinces of Suiyuan, Chahar, and Rehe. After the Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Sui People's Liberation Army jointly recovered Fengzhen on the 27th of last month, they continued to advance. On the 3rd of this month, they captured Liangcheng, Xintang, and Tiancheng Village, annihilating the majority of Fu’s bandit training Fourth Division, totaling more than 1,700 men. On the 6th, they recovered Helin, and on the 8th, they recovered Huaian, southwest of Zhangjiakou, completely annihilating the defending enemy of more than 1,000 men. On the same day, they also annihilated a part of the 630th Regiment of the 210th Division of the Provisional Fourth Army, totaling more than 600 men, in Guhoupu, north of Tianzhen. At the same time, our Sui-Meng local corps intercepted fleeing enemies from Liangcheng on the 4th, capturing more than 350 men. On the 8th, they also captured Qingshuihe. The Northwest People's Liberation Army recaptured ＠yang on the 4th. The local corps of the Second Sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia advanced into southern Suiyuan and annihilated three regiments under the command of the Jungar Banner Garrison Headquarters of the Mongolian bandits in the east of Dongsheng on the morning of the 11th, and captured Tishan, the location of the banner's Wangfu (Prince's residence), capturing the Mongolian Major General Commander Qi Yongquan alive. The local corps of the Third Sub-district advanced into Ningxia and liberated Huianpu, the location of the puppet Yanchi County Government, on the 11th. The Ji-Cha-Re-Liao People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local armed forces, recovered Chicheng and Diaobao in eastern Chahar on the 6th, annihilating more than 620 of Fu’s bandits, and recovered Longguan City on the 7th. By now, there are no bandit traces in the vast area of eastern Chahar.

　　The Chiang bandits in East China, under the shock of our powerful offensive, continued their "cross-country running." Our army recovered Xintai in central Shandong on March 30th, and then recovered Rizhao on the 4th of this month, and recovered Shijiusuo east of Rizhao on the 4th. Local armed forces in various places took the initiative to attack, protecting the spring plowing of the masses.　　　　　　　　　　　　(Xinhua News Agency)
