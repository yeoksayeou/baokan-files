Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th. The counties along the Yellow River in the Bohai area began the first phase of the Yellow River spring repair project last month, taking advantage of the slack season in spring plowing. More than 10,000 workers in Kenli County (formerly northeast of Lijin, a new county) braved the rain to rush to work starting on March 3rd. By the 23rd, they had completed a new dike 50 miles long from Siduan Village in the Linhe District to Laoyemiao Village in the Luozhen District. They also increased the height and width of the 15-mile river dike on the east bank of Zuojiazhuang. Jiyang County started work on the 13th, mobilizing more than 3,000 workers. Gaoyuan County started work on the 16th. The workers transported soil from four miles away from the river dike, making 14 round trips every day to repair the dangerous section of Liu Chunjia. It is expected that the initial repairs can be completed within 20 days. In addition, the Shandong Democratic Provincial Government River Affairs Bureau held a meeting of directors of county offices in early March to formulate a plan for Yellow River spring repairs. It was decided to divide the entire project into two phases: the first phase from Jingzhe to Qingming in the lunar calendar, and the second phase from Guyu to Mangzhong. The entire project requires a total of more than 2.4 million cubic meters of earthwork, 27.58 million catties of straw, more than 49,000 cubic meters of brick and stone, and 3.74 million man-days (including transportation). The largest earthwork project in the spring repair is the construction of the diversion dam at Qijiazui in Lijin. Other important projects include the dangerous sections of Qijiazui and Gongjia in Lijin County, Mawan and Daoxu in Putai County, and Liu Chunjia in Gaoyuan County.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th. Belated news: Chiang Kai-shek's bandits deliberately sabotaged the Yellow River spring repair project in the Bohai Liberated Area. At 2:00 p.m. on March 17th, two Chiang Kai-shek planes indiscriminately bombed and strafed dike repairing workers along the river in Yangzhuang, Jiyang, killing and wounding five workers, and severely disrupting the dike repairing project.
