　　Shangyao Work Group Absorbs Mass Opinions, Improves Leadership Style
    [Taihang News] The Shangyao Work Group in Licheng, in order to further improve its leadership ability and leadership style in its work, recently convened a review and criticism meeting of work groups, poor peasant and hired farmhand representatives, and group leaders to solicit everyone's opinions on the work group's work during this period. At the meeting, the poor peasant and hired farmhand representatives enthusiastically expressed their innermost thoughts and sincerely offered many valuable opinions to their "chiefs" (cadres), which was very educational for the comrades of the work group. Summarized, there were three points: (1) During discussions, only calling on the masses to discuss without timely explanations made it difficult for the masses to accept. For example, when everyone was asked to discuss "How do we poor peasants seize power?" they were only told to discuss it, without giving specifics or even an analogy. They hoped that cadres would not speak in generalities in the future, only talking about economic and political emancipation. What exactly would this entail, and how would it be done? They wanted a detailed explanation. (2) There were a few cadres whose words they couldn't understand. They were told that their class consciousness was not high enough. They knew they hadn't united before, but they didn't understand what class consciousness meant. This was like adults educating children or teachers educating students. They hadn't gone to school; how could they be asked to write? They hoped that in the future, people would speak in a way they could understand. (3) Individual cadres only raised difficult problems without thinking of solutions. They were afraid to talk to them. Sometimes they wanted to ask how a certain problem was explained, but they were afraid that as soon as they asked, the cadre would say, "What do you think? What's your understanding of that problem?" Wouldn't that stump them? So they didn't dare to ask. After listening to these opinions, the comrades of the work group felt that this meeting was very educational for them. Finally, the work group made a deep self-criticism in public.

　　上遥工作组吸
    收群众意见
  　改进领导作风
    【太行消息】黎城上遥工作组，为了在工作中进一步的提高领导能力，改进领导作风，于日前召开了个工作组及贫雇代表和小组长的检讨批评会，征求大家对工作组在这段工作的意见。会中贫雇代表都热烈的说出了自己的心里话，诚心诚意给自己的长工提出了许多宝贵的意见，对工作组的同志教育很大。综合起来一共有三点：（一）在讨论问题时，光叫群众讨论，不及时作解释说明，群众不容易接受。如叫大家讨论“咱们贫农如何掌权”时，光说叫讨论，不给具体说，也不给打个比方；他们希望干部以后说话不要笼统，光叫咱经济上、政治上翻身，究竟是怎会事情，怎样去办？要详细的解释清楚。（二）有几个干部说的话咱听不懂，说咱阶级觉悟不够，也知道是以前没有团结起来，就是不懂什么叫个阶级觉悟，这和大人教育小孩一样，和学校先生教育学生一样，咱还没有念过书，你倒叫写字还能行？希望今后对咱说话要说懂。（三）个别干部光出难题，不想办法，咱见了就不敢和他说话；有时见了也想问问那个问题是怎样说的，又怕咱才问他，他就要说：“你说怎么办？你对那一个问题怎样认识。”这不碰住咱了？所以咱不敢问。工作组同志听了这些意见以后，都感到这次会对自己教育很大，最后工作组并当众做了深刻检讨与自我批评。
