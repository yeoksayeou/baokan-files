　　The "Aid" to Siping
　　　　Huashan
　　After the recapture of Siping, in the basement of the Chiang bandit's "permanent fortifications" in the city, the reporter picked up a pile of the bandit army's telegrams scattered all over the floor. These were telegrams between Siping and Nanjing, Shenyang, and Changchun begging for reinforcements before the Liberation Army captured Siping, fully demonstrating the Chiang bandit's embarrassing situation of empty military strength.
　　When the Liberation Army cleared the outskirts of Siping, Peng E, commander of the 88th Division of the enemy's 71st Army, telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek on the 8th complaining bitterly that "the troops are too few to defend comprehensively, and a fierce battle is about to unfold." The Chiang bandit replied, "I have ordered Commander-in-Chief Wei to dispatch troops to aid immediately." However, Wei Lihuang, who had lost five cities in a row within a month of taking office, did not dare to reinforce even Liaoyang and Anshan, which were close at hand, so how could he care about Peng E, who was far away in Siping? Therefore, he could only "commend" him emptily. Peng, getting nowhere, telegraphed the Xinmin Military Department directly to complain, asking for the 262nd Regiment, originally under the 88th Division, to be "returned to its establishment." The regimental commander, Yang, replied, "Cannot be returned to its establishment at the moment," and advised Peng, saying, "Judging from the current passive situation, self-reliance is still eighty percent reliable, and reinforcements are only twenty percent reliable. That is what people think!" The Xinmin bandit military department also telegraphed back, telling him to "prepare for independent operations."
　　At this time, the Liberation Army had already reached the southwestern suburbs, and the main force was immediately attacking the north gate. Peng E then urgently telegraphed the Chiang bandits' New 6th Army and New 1st Army in Shenyang and Changchun for assistance. His telegram to Liao Yaoxiang, commander of the bandit's 9th Army Corps, stated, "If Siping is lost, it will be difficult to recover even if five more armies are rushed in." He asked Liao to "speak to Wei from the side, and make a grand plan early." However, the New 1st Army, which had been beaten into "first-class cripples" by the Liberation Army, was trapped in Changchun with no way to save itself, while the New 6th Army was huddled in Shenyang, where the retreat was cut off, also waiting for Chiang Kai-shek to "make a grand plan early." Therefore, their reply was only "Air-dropping 3,600 packs of cigarettes for consolation." But what fell from the sky was not cigarettes, but the Liberation Army's dense artillery shells.
　　At dawn on the 11th, Peng E, who had no hope of assistance, had to telegraph his old superior—Chen Mingren, who had suffered four defeats in four battles, lost six divisions, and was dismissed and now eating a leisurely meal as a "councillor" in Nanjing. Peng's telegram said, "The Beishan Heights have been completely lost, and the city gates are fighting fiercely. If reinforcements do not come decisively, the enemy (referring to the Liberation Army) will occupy Siping and open up the Pingqi (Qiqihar) and Pingmei (Hekou) lines, and the situation in the Northeast will be difficult to clean up." He wanted to ask this old superior, who was acting as a freeloader, to "speak to Chiang Kai-shek" and "make a grand plan early." At this time, the Liberation Army had completed its general offensive deployment, and Peng E, who had despaired of reinforcements, now only wanted "air support." However, Wei's reply said, "Will dispatch a large number as soon as the weather improves." So Peng E finally begged Wei tearfully, saying, "The enemy (Liberation Army) suddenly used thunderous momentum, with infantry and artillery closely coordinated, attempting a central breakthrough, determined to win. If reinforcements go north within a week, it will surely encourage my officers and soldiers to die for the (Chiang) spirit, otherwise please the Commander-in-Chief to decide." And the result of this "Commander-in-Chief's" decision was a telegram to Peng E saying: "Have approved the issuance of 100,000 multi-vitamins, to be airdropped immediately, and properly distributed to officers and soldiers for consumption, in order to regulate."
　　By midnight on the 11th, Peng E, who had completely run out of options, finally urgently telegraphed Yang, the commander of his 262nd Regiment, saying, "The isolated army is far away, and time is precious. Please persuade the two division commanders of the 87th and 91st Divisions to make a Qin court cry to the army commander? Strive to issue a call for the officers and soldiers of the 71st Army to automatically request the rescue of Siping, so as to urge the headquarters (Wei) to take decisive action." But as a result of the crying, Army Commander Liu Anqi only telegraphed back, saying, "I am commending your achievements to the whole country, hoping you will hold on to the end."
　　On the morning of the 12th, Wei sent another telegram to Peng, asking him to "strive for spare time and create a great victory that has never happened in history." But at this time, seven breaches had been opened in the city, and Peng E, who had telegraphed everywhere saying he would "live and die with Siping," had already changed into plain clothes and fled. The command post only left behind the "general's uniform" badges, medals, and a pile of dirty telegrams. The next morning, the 88th Division finally completed its fourth annihilation in the Northeast.

### 四平之“援”

　　四平之“援”
    华山
    四平收复后，记者在市内蒋匪“永久工事”的地下室里，拣起一堆狼藉满地的匪军电稿，这是在解放军攻克四平前，四平与南京、沈阳、长春之间乞援增援的电文，充分表现了蒋匪兵力空虚的窘相。
    当解放军扫清四平外围后，守敌七一军八十八师师长彭锷八日给蒋匪电叫苦道：“兵少不能全面防御，恶战更将展开。”蒋匪复电说：“已饬卫总司令火速派队驰援。”但上台一月即连失五城的卫立煌连近在门前的辽阳、鞍山都不敢增援，那还顾得上远在四平的彭锷，因此他只能空洞“嘉勉”一番。彭不得要领，又直接电新民军部诉苦，求将原属八十八师之二六二团“归还建制”。该团团长杨某复电说：“刻不能归还建制”，并向彭进言说：“以目前被动局势度之，自力更生仍属十分之八，援军可靠者十分之二，人心如此耳！”新民匪军部亦回电，要他“宜为独立作战准备。”
    这时，解放军已进抵西南城郊，主力并即进攻北门，彭锷于是又急电沈（阳）长（春）之蒋匪新六军、新一军等“友邻”呼援，其致匪九兵团司令官廖耀湘电称：“如四平被陷，则再赶调五个军亦难挽回。”要求廖匪向卫匪“从旁进言，早定大计”。但被解放军打成“头等残废”的新一军，被困长春，自救无门，而新六军则龟缩在后路已绝的沈阳，也在等待蒋匪“早定大计”哩。因此他们的回电只是“空投三千六百包香烟，以资慰劳。”但从空而降的还不是香烟，而是解放军密集的炮弹。
    十一日黎明告援无门的彭锷只得电求他的老上级——四战四败，丧兵六师被撤职现在南京吃着一份“参议”闲饭的陈明仁了，彭电说：“北山高地全失，城门苦战，若不断然来援，敌（按指解放军）进占四平，打通平齐（齐齐哈尔）、平梅（河口）两线，东北局势难以收拾”，他想请这位当清客的老上级能向蒋贼“进言”，“早定大计”。此时解放军已完成总攻部署，对援兵已绝望的彭锷，现在只要“空军增援”了。但卫匪的复电却说：“俟天气好转，即派大批前往”。于是彭锷最后声泪俱下的哀求卫匪说：“敌（解放军）突以雷霆之势，步炮紧密配合，企图中央突破，势在必得，周内如有援军北上，必能鼓励职部官兵殉国（蒋）之精神，否则请总司令裁夺”。而这位“总司令”裁夺结果，却电复彭锷锐：“已核准发给多种维他命十万粒，即日空投，妥为分配官兵服用，以资调剂。”
    到十一日夜半已完全走头无路的彭锷，最后是急电新民他的部下二六二团杨团长说：“孤军远悬，时间宝贵，务祈策动八十七师、九十一师两师长向军长作秦庭之哭？力求发出以七十一军官兵自动请求救援四平之呼声，促成总部（卫匪）断然之行动”。但哭的结果，军长刘安琪只回电说：“弟为兄等表扬战绩于全国，期固守到底”。
    十二日晨，卫匪还有一封电报给彭，还要他“争取余裕时间，创造历史未有之伟大胜利。”但是这时城里已七处洞开，而到处通电“与四平共存亡”的彭锷也早换上了便衣，逃之夭夭。指挥所只留下了脱下的“将军制服”徽饰勋章和一堆污浊的电稿。翌晨八十八师终于在东北完成了他的第四次覆殁。
