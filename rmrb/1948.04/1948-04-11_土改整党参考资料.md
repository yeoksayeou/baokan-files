Mao Zedong said: "...The typical experience of Ping Shan County,...The typical experience of Huang Jia Chuan,...The experience of Ping County in equally dividing land. These three experiences are worth printing into a small booklet and distributing to every rural work cadre." He also said: "This kind of booklet describing typical experiences... can enable inexperienced comrades to obtain methods to start with, and can powerfully defeat the anti-Marxist-Leninist commandism and tailism that seriously exist in the Party." This book is a booklet printed in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. It also includes the full text of Comrade Ren Bishi's report "Several Questions in Land Reform". Every comrade participating in land reform work must have this book at hand.

　　土改整党参考资料
    毛主席说：“……平山县的典型经验，……黄家川的典型经验，……崞县这样一个平分土地的经验。这三个经验，值得印成一个小册子，发给每个乡村的工作干部。”又说：“这种叙述典型经验的小册子，……能够使缺乏经验的同志们得到下手的方法，能够有力地击破在党内严重地存在着的反马列主义的命令主义和尾巴主义。”这书就是遵照毛主席这一指示印成的小册子。内中并加进了任弼时同志“土地改革中的几个问题”的报告全文。每一位参加土改工作的同志，是手头离不开这本书的。　　　　　华北新华书店发行
