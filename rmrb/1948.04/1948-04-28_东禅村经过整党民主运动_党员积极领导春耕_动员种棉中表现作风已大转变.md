Dongchan Village After Party Rectification Democratic Movement
    Party Members Actively Lead Spring Planting
    Their Style Has Greatly Changed in Mobilizing Cotton Planting

    [Ping Shun News] After the party rectification and democratic movement in the Dongchan Village Branch of the Fifth District, 39 party members have been agreed to by representatives of poor and middle peasants. 22 have joined the poor peasant league, and 13 middle peasant party members have joined the militia (there are still four party members whose problems have not been resolved). Party members Ma Buren and Niu Youdan were elected as directors of the production committee. Most party members were elected as mutual aid team leaders or captains. When Wang Heshui was elected as team leader, he said: "I will never be selfish again. I will listen to whatever everyone says. I am willing to let others work first every time." In general, party members felt that they had made many mistakes, but the higher authorities and the masses adopted an attitude of treating illnesses to save people, only helping to correct them, and not deliberately making things difficult, so their emotions were generally very good. Individual party members who were afraid of making mistakes and dared not work boldly gradually became active after everyone's persuasion and education. They expressed their willingness to do their best and use all their strength to fulfill their commitments in the democratic production movement. And they proposed: "Invest in plows and millstones, and be tested in work," each party member should lead a mutual aid team well. At the branch meeting, a party internal meeting reporting system was established. In this way, every party member enthusiastically went deep into the mutual aid team to consolidate it, and inspected the spring plowing and sowing preparation work in the team. At this time, it was found that the masses were not actively responding to the call to plant cotton. Party members and poor peasant mutual aid team leaders visited households one by one, mobilized individually, and led discussions within the group, with democratic discussion. There was no coercion or commandism in the method, which was completely different from the leadership methods in the past. Cheng Linbao, Wang Gutui and others said: "In the past, we dared not give opinions to cadres, and we listened to whatever the higher authorities said, and as a result, we suffered losses. We said that the climate in Pingshun is cold, 'Xiao Man flowers, don't return home', but the higher authorities insisted that 'Xiao Man flowers, grab a handful'. The soil is not good, the seedlings are not uniform, and weeds have to be pulled in the mixed fields. If you plant late, you have to rush to autumn plowing and turning the soil, and order to pull the flowers. Some collapse with a crash, and some haven't even been picked, and they must all be pulled out in three days. This year I won’t plant, so I can save myself the trouble of pulling them in the fall." Cheng Sangou said: "We haven't planted much cotton here, and there is no real guidance. Last year, the soil was the same, but there were several ways of doing it, some deep, some shallow, and there was not a single uniform seedling. The higher authorities told us to prune the branches and cut the tops into 'youtiao', but we were all doing it blindly, and when we saw the 'youtiao' growing vigorously, we left it as a fruit branch. The cotton grew as tall as a thigh, but we were reluctant to prune the tops. As a result, we harvested less, and everyone complained, and the technology was not improved." Some also said: "If we plant cotton, the livestock will have no grass to eat, no beans to eat, and cotton cannot be handed over as public grain, and it takes a lot of work. What's the point of planting it?" Party members and work team comrades did not scold the masses as in the past, but only encouraged everyone to continue the discussion. Then they found that many people advocated planting more cotton. Niu Shuanghai said: "In previous years, we couldn't catch the seedlings due to spring drought, but this year there is a lot of rain and the soil is wet, which guarantees good seedling catching. I planted one mu of cotton the year before last, and picked fifty-one jin, which yielded seventeen jin of ginned cotton, which I exchanged for one stone and seven dou of rice, and also harvested one dou of sesame seeds, which I exchanged for three dou of rice. If I planted grain, I would get at most one dan of grain. Planting cotton is worth three mu.” Cao Duiren said: "The government's call is not wrong. Don't just look at last year. I planted 1.7 mu of cotton the year before last, and ginned 32 jin of ginned cotton. I also harvested four dou of good sesame seeds. In addition to using some of it myself, I also sold cotton to buy three stone and six dou of rice, which was enough to buy grass and feed.” Chi Huaze said: "Don't just look at the current price of rice being expensive and cotton being cheap. Look at how much cotton our village's textile industry lacks? Every household buys cotton. If everyone plants more cotton, the textile industry will have raw materials, and there will be no need to sell grain to change seasons." The worker then made a review in front of the masses, explaining that the problem with last year's work was subjectivism and administrative orders, which harmed the masses. The party members made a reflection a few days ago, and we also made a guarantee that this year we must listen to everyone's opinions and plant and autumn plow according to the climate and season. If there are not enough cotton seedlings, permission is granted to bring a part of the mixed fields. Then, the cotton planting technology was compared with practical experience. The masses were very eager for technical knowledge, and the work team proposed to organize an old farmer in each brigade to form an agricultural technology research group. When it was time to plant cotton, all the comrades of the work team started working and used practical actions to help educate everyone (the comrades of the work team had practical experience in planting cotton), and the masses' enthusiasm for planting cotton was improved. Wang Gutui said: "The eight fen of cotton I planted last year, the technology was not good, and I didn't harvest a single jin. This year, the cadres mobilized, and I didn't even want to plant one fen. This time I have confidence. I have six mu of autumn land, and I must plant two mu of cotton." Wang Songbao said: "I originally planned to plant five fen, but now I also want to plant two mu." Everyone was talking about planting cotton. An old farmer was still not very confident and decided to plant three or two fen first to test it out. If he really benefited, he would plant more. After several days of deliberation, there were 3,151 mu of autumn land in the whole village. Last year, it was ordered to plant cotton, and at least one mu of cotton had to be planted for every ten mu of autumn land. As a result, 300 mu of cotton were planted by force. This year, it was planted voluntarily. According to incomplete statistics, each household reported planting 335 mu, and the cotton fields have now been repaired and the fertilizer prepared. After studying the climate, a plan was made to start planting at the beginning of the Grain Rain season.

    东禅村经过整党民主运动
    党员积极领导春耕
    动员种棉中表现作风已大转变
    【平顺消息】五区东禅村支部经过整党与民主运动，三十九个党员已经贫、中农代表同意，有二十二个参加了贫农团，十三个中农党员参加了民兵（还有四个党员问题没解决）。党员马补仁与牛有旦被选为生产委员会主任。大部党员被选为互助组长或队长。王河水当选组长时表示：“我今后再不自私自利，大家说啥我听啥，就是每次先给别人干我也愿意。”一般党员，都觉得自己犯的错误不少，但上级与群众都抱着治病救人的态度，只帮助改正，并不故意为难，所以情绪一般很好。个别怕出错，不敢大胆工作的党员，经过大家说服教育，也逐渐积极起来。表示愿意尽自己的才能，用上十二分力量，在民主抽补结合生产运动中来兑现。并提出：“投犁＠磨，工作中考验”，每个党员要领导好一个互助组。在支部会上定出党内的会议汇报制度。这样，每一个党员都热心的深入互助组，巩固互助组，在组中检查春耕下种准备工作。此时发现群众对种棉号召不积极响应，党员和贫雇互助组长就逐户上门访问，个别动员，又领导组内讨论，民主讨论。方式上没有一点强迫命令，与过去领导方法完全不同。程林保、王圪堆等说：“过去不敢给干部提意见，上级说啥咱听啥，结果跟上吃了亏。咱说是平顺气候冷，小满花，不归家，上级硬说小满花，大把抓，壤土不好，苗不齐，带上杂田还得拔，种的迟了，不到时候又突击秋耕、垡地，命令叫拔花，有的崩一朋，有的还没摘，限三天一律拔完。今年我不种，秋后省我拔。”程三狗说：“咱这里没有多种过花，都没有个正经传手，去年吧，一样壤土，几样做法，有的深，有的浅，没有一块齐全苗。上级叫打杈切顶打油条，咱们都是瞎胡乱打，看见油条长的旺，把它留下当果支。棉花长了大腿高，顶子还舍不得打。结果少收了，大家乱嚷，技术也提不高。”还有的说：“种上棉花牲口没草吃，没豆吃，棉花又不能交公粮，误工又多，种它干啥？”党员和工作组同志没有象过去一样去训群众，只启发大家继续讨论，随即发现也有许多人主张多种花，牛双孩说：“往年春旱捉不住苗，今年雨多地根湿，保证好捉苗，我前年种了一亩花，摘了五十一斤，轧了成花十七斤，换一石七斗米，还打了芝麻一斗，换米三斗。要种成谷，最多打一右谷，种花就怎误工，一亩也能顶三亩。”曹堆仁说：“政府号召没有错，不能光看去年，我前年种了一亩七分花，轧了成花三十二斤，还收了四斗好芝麻，除我自己用了一部分，还卖花买米三石六斗，买草买料都合算。”池花则说：“大家不要光看现在米贵花便宜，看看咱村纺织缺多少花？家家户户买花。要是大家多种花，纺织有原料，换季也不用卖粮食。”工作员接着在群众面前检讨，说明去年工作的毛病是主观主义，行政命令，害了群众，前几天党员作了反省，我们也提出保证，今年一定要听取大家意见，按气候节令下种与秋耕。如果棉花不够苗，准许带一部杂田。接着又将种棉技术用实际经验来对证。群众对技术的要求十分迫切，工作组即提出要在每个大队组织一个老农，成立农业技术研究小组。到棉花下种时，工作组同志全部动手，用实际行动帮助教育大家（工作组同志对种棉有实际经验），群众种棉情绪就提高了。王圪堆说：“我去年种的八分棉花，技术也不好，一斤也没收，今年干部们动员，我就连一分也不想种，这一回我有了信心，我有六亩秋地，一定要种二亩棉花。”王松保说：“我原来计划种五分，现在我也要种二亩。”大家对种棉都纷纷的议论开了。有一个老农仍然信心不大，决定先种上三、二分试验一下，要真正得了利再多种。经过几天酝酿，全村秋地三一五一亩，去年命令种棉，每十亩秋地至少要种一亩棉花，结果硬种棉三百亩，今年自觉自愿的种。据不完全统计，各户自报种三百三十五亩，现已将棉田修理好，肥料准备好，经过研究气候，订出计划，在交谷雨节开始下种。
