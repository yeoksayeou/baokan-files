Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Reports from various sources: The latest issue of the "Ladies' Home Journal" published in New York contains the wartime diaries of the late General Stilwell. In his diary, Stilwell revealed Chiang Kai-shek's great conspiracy to actively engage in civil war during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and praised the Chinese Communist Party as the only hope for saving China. The diary analyzes Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary policies during the War of Resistance, saying: "Chiang is an insignificant person, and he should be held responsible for the main disasters of the war." "In order to maintain his regime, Chiang did not hesitate to push China into the danger of disaster." He pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek "withheld lend-lease materials to fight the Communists, instead of using them to help the United States defeat Japan." "Chiang Kai-shek grabbed every drop of American aid he could get, demanded more aid, and then hoarded it for the upcoming civil war." The diary revealed how Chiang Kai-shek had no intention of fighting Japan, using his more than 200,000 best-trained and equipped troops to blockade the Chinese Communist Party (referring to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region), but refused to use 10,000 men to help defend the American-built airfield. Stilwell pointed out: "Chiang Kai-shek's one-party government is supported by the party's secret service. He does not keep his promises and does not fight seriously. He cannot see that the Chinese people welcome the Communist Party and regard the Communist Party as the only hope to save them from heavy taxes, harmful troops, and Dai Li's secret agents. Under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, the Chinese people saw that all Chiang could give them was greed, corruption, favoritism, inflation, terrible waste of life, and ruthless obliteration of human rights." (United Press) Based on his years of service in China, Stilwell judged that no amount of aid and weapons could save Chiang Kai-shek. He said: "The Kuomintang is corrupt, incompetent, inconsistent in words and deeds, imposes exorbitant taxes, hoards and speculates, engages in black market trading, is indifferent to the Chinese economy, and does business with the enemy; while the Chinese Communist Party's program is: reduce taxes, reduce rent and interest, improve production and living standards, and be consistent in words and deeds." (United Press) Stilwell advocated that the Communist Party should take the lead during the war. In 1944, he believed: "The Chinese Communist Party provides the people with a better future than Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. Everything in the Communist area is better than in the Kuomintang area." "The Communist army is better at fighting than the Kuomintang army." However, his opinion was not adopted by President Roosevelt. According to a United Press dispatch on the 30th: He felt that Roosevelt had betrayed him, and throughout the diary, he suspected when he would be completely betrayed. He said: "A fierce battle is going on in Washington, and he was hurt by a cold arrow in this battle." It is reported that General Stilwell passed away in 1946. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as Chiang Kai-shek's Chief of Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the American Army in the China Theater. In late October 1944, he was transferred from the China Theater by the US government due to dissatisfaction with Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary policies. When he was in China, he strongly criticized the Kuomintang's passive resistance to Japan and its active anti-communism and helping the Japanese invaders, and firmly advocated uniting with the Chinese Communist Party to jointly resist Japan. He expressed sympathy for the CCP's policies, and before leaving his post, he sent a US military observation group to Yan'an to establish contact with the Chinese Liberated Areas.

　　故史迪威将军的战时日记
  　揭露蒋匪帮祸国殃民
    赞扬解放区一切都比蒋区好
    【新华社陕北五日电】各方讯：纽约出版之最近一期“妇女家庭杂志”刊载已故史迪威上将之战时日记。史氏在日记中，揭发蒋匪在抗战时即积极从事内战的大阴谋，盛赞中共已成为拯救中国之唯一希望。日记分析蒋匪在抗战时期的反动政策说：“蒋是一个微不足道的小人，他要负战争主要灾祸之责。”“蒋为了保持自己的政权，不惜把中国推入灾难的危险中，”他指出蒋匪“扣留租借物资用以打共产党，而不是用来帮助美国击溃日本”。“蒋介石抓住他所能获得的每一滴美国援助，要求给他更多的援助，然后积存起来，用以进行即将爆发的内战。”日记揭露蒋介石如何无意对日作战，以其二十余万在训练与装备方面都最优良的军队封锁中国共产党（按指陕甘宁边区），但却拒绝用一万人去协助防卫美国建造的飞机场。史氏指出：“蒋介石领导的一党政府，是以党的特务机关来支持的，他不守信约，不认真作战。他看不见中国人民群众欢迎共产党，把共产党当做拯救他们摆脱苛重捐税、害民军队和戴笠特务之唯一希望。在蒋介石统治下，中国人民看见蒋所能给予人民的，只是贪婪、腐化、徇私舞弊、通货膨胀、可怖的生命的浪费、和冷酷无情的抹煞人权。”（合众社）史迪威根据其在中国服务数年的亲身经验判断，肯定无论多少援助和武器都无法拯救蒋介石，他说：“国民党是腐败无能、言行不符、苛捐杂税、囤积居奇、买卖黑市、对中国经济漠不关心、和敌人做生意；而中国共产党的纲领则是：减低税额、减租减息、提高生产与生活标准、言行一致。”（合众社）史迪威主张在战时由共产党担负领导责任，他在一九四四年认为：“中国共产党比起蒋介石的国民党来，是给人民提供了一个更好的前途。共产党地区的每一件事，都比国民党的好。”“共产党军队要比国民党的更善于作战”。但是他的意见没有被罗斯福总统所采纳。据合众社三十日电：他感觉到罗斯福出卖了他，在整个日记中他都在怀疑他会什么时候被彻底出卖。他说：“华盛顿进行着激烈的战斗，他就是在这战斗中被人暗箭所伤”。按史迪威将军已于一九四六年逝世，抗日战争时任蒋介石参谋长，兼中国战区美军总司令，一九四四年十月底因不满蒋匪的反动政策，被美政府调离中国战区。当其在中国时，对国民党之消极抗战，积极反共帮助日寇的罪行，曾猛予抨击，并坚主与中国共产党一致共同抗战。对中共政策表示同情，在其离职前曾派美军观察组来延，建立与中国解放区的联系。
