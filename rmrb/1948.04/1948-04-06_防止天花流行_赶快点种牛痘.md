To Prevent Smallpox Epidemic, Get Vaccinated Quickly

Currently, smallpox is流行(liúxíng), and cases have been discovered in areas such as Longquan Village and Madeng Village in Wu'an, and Jiuquan Village in Cixian County, the Second Taihang District. Regardless of gender or age, the disease is spreading rapidly, and deaths are reported daily. This disease is extremely contagious, and the mortality rate is also very high, averaging around 15 to 40 percent. Once infected, even if one survives, they will lose a layer of skin and be left with pockmarks. It is hoped that local administrative and medical authorities will quickly administer vaccinations to prevent the rampant spread of smallpox.

Symptoms of Smallpox:

The general incubation period for smallpox is approximately seven to thirteen days before symptoms appear. Individuals with weaker resistance tend to experience more severe symptoms. The progression can be divided into three stages:

   I. Initial Stage of Smallpox: Characterized by initial chills, high fever, headache, back pain, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, inflammation of the larynx, trachea, conjunctiva, etc., splenomegaly, and the appearance of faint red spots all over the face, limbs, and body, which disappear after one or two days.

  II. Rash and Pustule Stage: After the third day, body temperature and the above symptoms may temporarily lessen. Subsequently, small red rashes reappear all over the face, limbs, and body. By the fifth or sixth day, the red rashes turn into blisters (blister stage), which gradually develop and enlarge. Approximately one week later, they turn into pea-sized pustules (pustule stage), accompanied by high fever, severe pain throughout the body, and a severely confused state of consciousness. At this stage, if care is inadequate, it can easily lead to heart failure or complications such as pneumonia and septicemia, resulting in death.

 III. Scabbing Stage: The pustule stage lasts for about three or four days before the pustules rupture, and the sores gradually form dry scabs. The body temperature gradually decreases, and around the fourteenth or fifteenth day, the scabs fall off, leaving behind pockmarks.

Prevention of Smallpox:

   I. To effectively prevent smallpox, the best method is vaccination. Only through vaccination can immunity to smallpox be acquired and infection avoided (those who have already had smallpox have permanent immunity and do not need to be vaccinated again).

  II. Once smallpox occurs, or if someone exhibits initial symptoms of smallpox, strict isolation should be maintained from unvaccinated individuals and those who have not had smallpox (especially children). All clothing and utensils used by the patient should be thoroughly disinfected (boiled in boiling water or burned). The patient's excrement, nasal discharge, sputum, and other secretions should not be discarded carelessly; they should first be sprinkled with lime and then buried with soil.

 III. Smallpox patients must remain isolated for at least six weeks until the scabs have completely fallen off and the epidermis has fully regenerated before they can go out, otherwise they still pose a risk of infecting others. (Border Region Health Bureau)

　　防止天花流行　赶快点种牛痘
    现在天花正在流行，先后发现的地区，有武安龙泉村、马登村，太行二分区磁县的九泉村等。不论男女老少，均辗转传染，死亡日有所闻。此病传染力极为迅速，死亡数也很大，平均在百分之十五到四十左右。如一经传染，纵然不死，也得脱一身皮，遗留麻脸。希各地行政机关与医务机关，赶快施种牛痘，防止天花猖獗。
    天花的症状：
    天花一般的潜伏期：大约须经过七天到十三天即发作，没有抵抗力的人，症状往往显得沉重。经过可分为三个时期：
    一、天花的开始期，初发恶寒，高热，头、腰疼痛，恶心呕吐，精神恍惚，喉头、气管、结膜等发炎，脾脏肿大，颜面、四肢和全身遍发淡红色斑，一、二天后即消散。
    二、发疹和脓疱期：到第三天后，体温和以上症状会一时减轻，随即在颜面、四肢和全身又遍发小红疹，到第五、六天上，红疹变为水泡（水泡期），水泡即慢慢发展增大，大约在一星期后即化成豌豆大的脓疱（脓疱期），发高热，全身痛苦，症状极为沉重，意识晕迷。这时如果照顾不好，很容易心脏衰弱，或合并肺炎、败血症等传染病而死亡。
    三、结痂期：化脓期约经过三、四天即破溃，痘疮慢慢结成干痂，体温逐渐下降，到十四、五天左右痂皮脱落，形成麻脸。
    天花的预防法：
    一、要确实预防天花，最好的办法就是种牛痘，只有种了痘，才有对天花的免疫性，才能避免传染（已出过天花的已有永久免疫，不必再种）。
    二、一旦发生天花，或有天花开始时症状的人，要与未种过痘、未出过天花的人（尤其是儿童）严格隔离，病人所用的一切衣物、用具都应严密消毒（用开水煮沸或火焚），病人的大小便及流的鼻涕、吐痰等分泌排泄物，都不应随便抛弃，先撒上石灰，然后用土掩埋。
    三、凡患天花病人，最少须经过六星期，待痂皮完全脱落，表皮完全新生后，才能出外，否则仍有传染他人的危险。（边区卫生局）
