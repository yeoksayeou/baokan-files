Adhering to the Principle of Voluntary Mutual Assistance
　　Solving the Difficulties of Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers
　　Democratic Leadership in Yuanchao Houxian Village Promotes Spring Ploughing
　　[Our News] In Yuanchao Houxian Village, some poor peasants and hired laborers who had not yet turned over a new leaf were unable to carry out spring ploughing due to lack of food. In order to solve this specific difficulty, the leadership quickly distributed 120,000 yuan in bank loans and also allocated 40 mu of land from the organs' production to farmers lacking land for cultivation, thus initially resolving the difficulties. During the process of cultivation, specific difficulties arose. Namely, out of the entire village, besides those who voluntarily partnered for ploughing, 22 poor peasant and hired laborer households lacked livestock. They felt that without mutual assistance with households owning livestock, these difficulties could not be resolved. When discussing how to engage in mutual assistance with middle peasants, three out of the four production committee members advocated: "At the mass meeting, the poor peasants and hired laborers without livestock should be assigned to the mutual aid groups with livestock. We should make it clear to the middle peasants that anyone who doesn't engage in mutual assistance with the poor peasants is a stubborn element." One committee member said this was not right and that voluntary participation was preferable. However, under the rebuttal of the other three, the one with the correct opinion also wavered. At this time, the leading cadres conducted persuasive education, explaining that there should be no coercion or actions violating the interests of middle peasants in production. After the production committee members understood the spirit of the middle peasant policy, they immediately agreed to organize mutual aid based on the principle of not harming the interests of middle peasants. First, they held a meeting to discuss with all the poor peasants. In their speeches, some poor peasants also expressed the idea of forcing middle peasants into mutual aid, and some even proposed that middle peasants should cultivate land on behalf of poor peasants. However, some honest poor peasants and hired laborers pointed out: Mutual assistance should be fair, and the middle peasants' small cattle are not easy to come by! The leading cadres and production committee members promoted these correct opinions, corrected the narrow-minded "leftist" ideas of some people, and everyone discussed a fair and equivalent method of mutual assistance. Then, a meeting of all middle and poor peasants was convened. At the meeting, middle and poor peasants were enlightened and educated to promote class friendship and solve production difficulties. Middle peasants had surplus livestock, and poor peasants had surplus labor. Fair mutual assistance would benefit both sides. They called for voluntary mutual assistance. The middle peasants verbally agreed that the method was good, but they did not offer to partner with anyone in particular. Some middle peasants claimed that their own livestock was not even sufficient for their needs! Their attitudes were not very positive. The poor peasants, unable to find mutual assistance, grumbled, "Who would help us poor folks?" The difficulties were still not well resolved. The leading cadres studied the methods and mobilized the branch party members and cadres (the leading cadres directly approached the poor peasants and hired laborers in the village, without involving the old organization), explaining that party members and cadres should take the initiative to help poor peasants solve production difficulties, and also clarifying the principle of helping poor peasants in production without harming middle peasants. After this education and mobilization, the party members with cattle automatically went to find poor peasants for mutual aid, and also introduced middle peasant households to poor peasants for mutual aid. Through the automatic searching and introduction by party members, without any coercion or orders, the poor peasants without cattle all had mutual aid partners within one day. The middle and poor peasants were very harmonious and happy. Poor peasant Wang Changjiang said, "This time, the mutual assistance was resolved very peacefully!" Some said, "The party members are still much better." The entire village's production is now underway.
　　The main experience of this work is to be enthusiastic and patient in solving the difficulties of the poor peasants and hired laborers, and to adhere to the principle of voluntary mutual assistance without harming the middle peasants, to persuade and educate the masses, and not to be a tailist. For example, in the production committee and poor peasant meetings, when the masses had the sentiment of forcing middle peasants into mutual aid, if one did not patiently persuade them and adhere to principles, but only made empty calls for voluntary participation, the result would not be tailism and the mistake of forced mutual aid, but production would be left to its own devices, and the difficulties of the poor peasants would not be resolved. Another point is to combine production tasks with the education and transformation of village cadres and party members. Facts have proved that they can play an active role. (Editor's note: Yuanchao Houxian Village mobilizes party members to play an exemplary role in production, and educates party members to grasp the party's policies and promote production, which is worthy of emulation by all localities.)

　　坚持自愿互助原则
  　解决贫雇畜力困难
    元朝后现城民主领导推动春耕
    【本报消息】元朝后现城村，部分未翻透身的贫雇，因没吃的，没法春耕。领导上为解决这一具体困难，将银行贷款十二万元迅速分配下去，又将机关生产地四十亩也分配给缺少土的农民耕种，困难得到初步解决。在进行耕种中，又发生具体困难，即全村除自愿搁犋的以外，有廿二户贫雇没牲口，他们觉得如不与有牲口户互助，这困难就没法解决。在商量如何与中农互助时，四个生产委员有三个主张：“在群众大会上把没牲口的贫雇划到有牲口的互助组里去，向中农讲明谁不与贫农互助谁就是顽固。”有一个委员说这样不对，还是自愿的好。但在其他三人反驳下，这一个有正确意见的也发生动摇。领导干部这时即进行说服教育，说明生产中不能有任何强制及违犯中农利益的行为。生产委员明白了中农政策精神后，当即商定了在以不损害中农利益的原则下，自愿结合组织互助。首先开会和全体贫农商量。贫农在发言中，也有主张强制中农互助的口气，甚至有的提出要中农给贫农代耕，但另有些老实贫雇提出：互助总要公道，中农的小牛也不是容易来的呀！领导干部与生产委员，发扬了这种正确意见，纠正了部分人偏狭的左的思想，大家商讨出公平等价的互助办法。接着又召开了全体中贫农大会，在会上启发教育中贫农发扬阶级友爱解决生产困难，中农牲口有余力，贫农人力有余力，公平互助双方都有利；号召自愿互助，中农口头上说办法好，但不提出自己和谁互助，有的中农则提出自己牲口还不够用哩！态度都不大积极。贫农在找不到互助情况下，发牢骚说：“谁和咱穷小子互助呢？”困难仍未很好解决。领导干部研究了办法，又和支部党员干部动员（领导干部到村直接找的贫雇，没找旧组织），说明党员和干部应主动起来帮助贫雇解决生产困难，又讲明了帮助贫雇生产与不能损害中农的原则。经过这样教育动员，有牛的党员下去自动找贫雇互助，并又给贫雇介绍中农户互助，经党员自动找贫雇及介绍，没有任何强迫和命令，一天时间，没牛的贫雇都有了互助对象了。中贫农都很融洽愉快。贫农王长江说：“这次互助解决真和气！”有的说：“党员还是好的多。”现全村生产正开展中。
    这段工作的主要经验是要热心耐心为贫雇解决困难，又要坚持不伤害中农的自愿互助原则，说服教育群众，不作尾巴。如在生产委员会及贫农会上，当群众有强制中农互助情绪时，如不耐心说服坚持原则，只空号召自愿，结果不是形成尾巴主义，产生强制互助错误；就是生产自流，贫雇困难得不到解决。再一点就是结合生产任务，教育改造村干和党员。事实证明，他们是能够发挥积极作用的。（编者按：元朝后现城动员党员在生产中起模范作用，并教育党员掌握党的政策推动生产，值得各地取法）。　　　　　　　（县委办公室通报）
