    My Xinxiang Third District Armed Work Team
    Crosses the Dan River to Take the Initiative
    [This newspaper dispatch] A unit of the Xinxiang Third District Armed Work Team, crossed the Dan River to operate in the Ancun area earlier this month. They encountered more than ten members of the puppet Huojia Township team who came to Ancun to demand grain and money. After the enemy entered the village, our armed work team bravely charged and fought. After a one-minute battle, except for a few who fled, they captured Bo Zhaoyin, the captain of the puppet Huojia Dan River Township team, and squad leader Zhai Chunyuan, seizing one 38-type rifle, two Mauser pistols, two warhorses, and more than 50 rounds of ammunition. Bo Zhaoyin had been acting as a bully and doing evil during the enemy's occupation, extorting money from the people, and constantly leading teams to the north bank of the Hebei River to rob grain. After he was captured this time, the masses were all happy and said: This time we've got you! (Xinxiang County Headquarters)
    Another dispatch: On the 10th of this month, at dawn, the enemy in Huixian County divided into three routes to rob grain from my East and West Lianyan areas, and captured 15 people and one horse. After being discovered by the armed work team of my First District, they immediately divided into routes to intercept them, rescuing all the people. Two enemies were injured and fled in panic.
