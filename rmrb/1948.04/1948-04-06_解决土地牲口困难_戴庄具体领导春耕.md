　　Solving Land and Livestock Difficulties
  　Dai Zhuang Takes Concrete Leadership in Spring Plowing
　　[Our dispatch] Xiajin County has begun specific leadership for spring plowing. Dai Zhuang has selected seven poor peasant committee members from the existing three poor peasant groups and also absorbed three middle peasants to establish a temporary spring plowing committee to lead the whole village in actively carrying out spring plowing. This village has 369 mu of fruit-bearing land that has not yet been distributed. The Spring Committee decided through discussion to lend it to farmers lacking land according to the principle of filling gaps and considering labor power. As a result, the masses are very satisfied. Poor peasants happily said: "This time, we can borrow a piece of land with peace of mind." A total of 30 poor households borrowed 180 mu of land. With land, they still lack livestock and fertilizer. The committee also seized the opportunity to solve this difficulty for everyone, lending the undistributed floating wealth and bean cakes to the masses according to the opinions of the masses, and appraising and distributing them through self-reporting and public discussion. The issue of livestock is resolved by three or four households voluntarily combining to buy together. Now there are already several groups, all discussing one after another: This year, production is worry-free in every aspect. In this way, everyone is willing to produce well and live a good life.
　　Also: In the production meeting in Xiaguanqiao Village, in the Third District, many poor peasants and hired laborers raised difficulties such as lack of agricultural implements, grain, and fertilizer, and requested to distribute the undistributed floating wealth to solve them. At that time, the leadership grasped this demand of the masses, promptly selected four upright old village cadres and seven poor peasants, organized a temporary production committee, and led the distribution of floating wealth to solve the difficulties in production. According to the method of filling gaps by supplying what is lacking, after heated deliberation and debate, it was truly done fairly and reasonably. After the distribution, everyone happily said: This really solves the difficulties.

　　解决土地牲口困难
  　戴庄具体领导春耕
    【本报消息】夏津县已具体进行春耕领导，戴庄从现有的三个贫农小组中，选出七个贫农委员，又吸收了三个中农成立临时春耕委员会，领导全村积极进行春耕。这个村有未分配的果实地三百六十九亩，春委会讨论决定按填补原则与劳动力情况借给缺少田地的农民耕种。这样一来，群众都很满意，贫农高兴地说：“这回可借到一块舒心地了。计三十户贫农共借地一百八十亩。有了土地，但仍缺牲口肥料，委员会又抓紧解决大家这一困难，根据群众意见，将未分配的浮财、豆饼借给群众，按自报公议办法评定分配。牲口问题是三四家自愿结合伙买。现已有好几组，都纷纷议论：今年生产事事舒心，这样谁也愿意好好生产过好时光。
    又：三区下官桥村在生产大会上，好多贫雇农提出缺农具、粮食、肥料等困难，要求分未分的浮财解决。当时领导上抓住群众这个要求，及时选出四个正派的旧村干与七个贫农，组织临时生产委员会，领导分配浮财解决生产中的困难。按缺啥补啥的填补办法，经热烈的评议争论后，真正做到了公平合理。分完后都高兴的说：这可真正解决困难了。
