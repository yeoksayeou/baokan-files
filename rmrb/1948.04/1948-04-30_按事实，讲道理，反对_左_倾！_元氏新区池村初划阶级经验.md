Based on Facts, Reason, and Oppose "Left" Leaning!
    —Initial Class Division Experience in Chichi Village, Yuanshi New District

Chichi Village in Yuanshi is a village in the New District. The class division in this village progressed through exploration, encountering many twists and complex problems. During the class division process in the village, the work team, the poor peasant association, and the masses engaged in fierce anti-"left" and anti-technical viewpoint struggles. This allowed the masses to understand the standards, significance, and methods of class division. Strategic education was conducted promptly during the division, enabling the masses to truly master the weapon of class division. Class division became a mass movement, enhancing the class consciousness of the masses and achieving the goal of uniting the peasants and dividing the landlords. The main issues are written below for reference by various regions:

    (1) Handing Over the Weapon of Class Division to the Masses.

Class division must have a mass backbone, allowing the entire masses to mature through deliberation and teaching them the weapon of class division so that they can master it skillfully. This is the key issue in determining the success or failure of class division. The work team leadership paid special attention to this issue. In addition to conducting class propaganda during the organization of the poor peasant association, a class division training class was opened on March 22nd, attended by sixty-two poor and hired peasants and twenty middle peasants. Everyone unanimously recognized that nothing could be done if class division was not done well. At the request of the masses, class division learning was launched. The main content was the eight principles for distinguishing between rich peasants and middle peasants. The main standards for class division were to look at land, exploitation, and labor. After studying specific households, everyone was in high spirits and decided to spend two days publicizing class division. Eighty-two trained individuals became class division propagandists. After two days of publicity, more than two-thirds of the 377 members of the poor peasant association had learned the standards of class division. The masses were very concerned about class division. The middle peasants felt that the Communist Party was fair in its dealings when they heard that not a single one of them would be classified as an enemy, and they also joined the movement to learn about class division.

    (2) Sticking to the Eight Articles, "Left" Emotions, Creating Many Enemies.

On the 25th, class division began. First, the poor peasant association absorbed a small number of middle peasants to divide landlords and rich peasants. At this time, the masses were not clear about the strategy of class division, coupled with the "left" emotions of the work team cadres, which formed a simple search for landlords and rich peasants, sticking rigidly to the eight articles. Li Dan's family of eight had thirty-three mu of land. His nephew brought fifteen mu of land to join them when he was young (to help his nephew). When calculating, his nephew was regarded as a long-term worker, and the fifteen mu of land was regarded as exploitation, and he was classified as a rich peasant. Wu Gou said, "Only rich peasants are being classified. We also have to look at the land. According to the land, he is a middle peasant." Some other people said, "You want to shield him!" The label of "shielding" suppressed the masses, and they did not dare to engage in democratic debate. The majority of people suggested that someone was a middle peasant, but few dared to say he was a rich peasant. If a minority said someone was a rich peasant, no one dared to say anything even if he was a middle peasant. Comrade Guo Xianglin of the work team was happy when he classified a landlord or rich peasant household, and felt that it was a waste of effort if it wasn't a landlord or rich peasant. Under the pressure of "left" emotions, correct democratic debate could not be carried out, and class division became a simple technical task. When someone was mentioned, no facts were discussed, only the words "landlord" or "rich peasant" were said, "passed," and that was it. During the division, a short-term worker was counted as three workers, and women were not counted as labor. As a result, twenty-three landlord households and forty-nine rich peasant households were classified, accounting for 17.4 percent of the village. Some poor and hired peasants were surprised to see the courtyard full of "landlords and rich peasants" and said, "Oh my, so many people!"

    (3) Launching Internal Ideological Struggle, Anti-"Left" Leaning.

After this class division, the work team, in conjunction with the heads of the poor peasant association groups and some good members, studied the problems of this class division. At first, everyone thought the division was not bad. Comrade Huo Fan took out the central draft of class division and read it to everyone. After reading a few sections, the village cadres were listening quietly, but some cadres of the work team turned their heads and said, "No, this won't work. If we divide like this, there will be no landlords and rich peasants. How can the poor people turn over?" The village cadres felt that they had put in so much effort and made mistakes, and there was no way to change it. Comrade Huo Fan explained that we must study the class division documents carefully and guided everyone to start a debate. After the debate, everyone felt that the problems with this class division were: (1) The labor of the households being classified was calculated too low, and the labor of long-term and short-term workers was calculated too high. For example, a short-term worker was counted as three workers, and Hou Buleng's long-term worker could only be counted as half a worker, but was also counted as one. (2) Assessing people based on personality and behavior, thus classifying Hou Heixiao and Zhao Baoyuan, middle peasants who had served as puppet village chiefs and joint guarantee directors, as landlords. (3) Wanting to get rich, wanting to fight whoever had something, classifying Shi Qunshan, who started from labor, as a landlord, and Dong Qingyun, a middle peasant, as a rich peasant. (4) Only looking at exploitation and not taking care of the lonely and widowed, resulting in the classification of the widow Yin Jize and the blind man Yin Wanzi as rich peasants (later changed to middle peasants). (5) Only looking at labor and not looking at land, classifying Shi Luzi (who had no house or land), who had been in decline for more than ten years and did not engage in honest work, as a landlord (later changed to "hooligan element"). Then, they studied the root causes of "left," whether "left" was good or not, who was "left" in the end, and whether the masses demanded "left." After research, everyone realized that the masses were reasonable, only a few masses demanded "left," and the most basic thing was the immaturity of the work team cadres towards "left" in the reorganization, and they did not thoroughly understand the harm of "left" to the masses. The ideological emotions of "left" were not thoroughly liquidated. The reflection from the poor and hired peasants, "Oh my! I'm so scared! So many people!" shows that "left" is not good, the masses do not demand "left," and they do not want to create more enemies. After the ideology was cleared, the street committee members, group leaders, and good members were combined to review the landlords and rich peasants household by household, letting them first know why someone was classified as a landlord, someone was classified as a rich peasant, or should not be a landlord or rich peasant, so that they knew more about the reasons in advance. This point is very important and has great significance for cultivating the leading core of the poor peasant association. At the same time, they also classified middle and poor peasant classes again, and many poor peasants who were wrongly considered middle peasants in the past were classified. Thus, ninety-eight more members of the poor peasant association were developed, bringing the total to 475.

    (4) Presenting Facts, Reasoning, and Convincing Everyone.

Then, the poor peasant association and the middle peasants jointly re-examined the classes, corrected the wrongly determined components, and proposed "speak the facts, reason things out, no one can use big hats to suppress people, do not wrong a single person; if you divide wrongly, you will hit your own people and increase the enemies." Then, using land ownership and production relations as the standard, the classes were re-examined, and the masses launched a heated debate. After discussion, it was decided to let landlords and rich peasants also participate in the mass meeting, classify their classes, and they could also raise dissenting opinions. At this time, the masses were very nervous, investigated the facts, and reasoned at the meeting. The landlords and rich peasants, hearing that they were going to reason, secretly gathered to discuss countermeasures. They shouted, "If we reason, we'll be justified. We'll go to the meeting and reason with them!" After the masses conducted investigations, they classified the classes at the general meeting. First, Lei Qingtang, who had committed major crimes, was classified. He was asked to report his family situation and exploitation facts at the meeting. His attitude was very tough: "I only have these few acres of family property, nothing else. Fellow villagers, watch!" The masses reasoned with him: "You hire two long-term workers, and you only have one worker yourself. You also lend cotton with interest, counting eight hundred jin as a thousand jin. Isn't this exploitation?" Qinghai also poured out the grievances of his father for many years: "You forcibly occupied my eighteen mu of land and a house, forcing my father to hang himself, locking my father in the room, giving him a knife and a rope, you said just these two things, you can die however you want." After the masses stated his exploitation crimes one by one, they asked him which one was not true. Faced with ironclad facts, he could not argue and replied weakly, "What the fellow villagers said is true, I am not wronged at all." With his own consent, he was classified as a rich peasant. When Shi Jiufeng was classified, the masses raised opinions and complained. According to his family having three people and sixty mu of land, and him not working himself, hiring two long-term workers and one cook, he was classified as an exploiting landlord. In this class division, the landlords and rich peasants raised all their dissenting opinions, but their sophistry that did not conform to the facts was refuted by the evidence of the facts. Facts proved that public class division at the mass meeting allowing landlords and rich peasants to participate in reasoning not only did not suppress the peasants but made the peasants more united. There was more investigation and more preparation before the class division, truly achieving presenting the facts and reasoning. From the perspective of reason and ideology, the landlords were conquered, and the peasants were mobilized, making class division a mass struggle movement, enlightening the class consciousness of the masses. On the other hand, the landlord and rich peasant families were divided. The meeting focused on explaining why the landlords were confiscated, why the rich peasants were levied excess portions, and why the new rich peasants only moved the excess land, explaining the different treatment of the party towards various classes. The masses generally reflected, "The Communist Party tells the truth, no one suffers." Shi Qunshan was initially classified as a landlord. The masses reflected that Qunshan started from labor and was good to the long-term workers and fellow villagers. Now he does not work because he is over sixty years old and was crushed by a truck. Later, Qunshan was classified as a new rich peasant who started from labor at the mass meeting. Shi Erchou worked all year round, and his brother Shi Guanchun idled around. At first, the whole family was classified as rich peasants. Erchou said: I suffered from Guanchun's loss. If he worked like me, he would not become a rich peasant. Later, Shi Erchou himself was classified as a middle peasant, and Shi Guanchun was classified as an exploiting landlord. Yin Fuxiang had a stepmother, and he was often bullied at home and often worked, being in a state of exploitation. His family was classified as landlords, but Fuxiang himself was not regarded as a landlord, and his status was classified separately. Shi Ruishan's son, Minghe, also worked at home and was bullied, and was also treated differently; Shi Yangzi's son was also treated differently. After this division, the landlord and rich peasant classes and their families underwent great differentiation. Shi Qunshan said: "The Communist Party is really reasonable, the fellow villagers are good to me, I cannot be sorry to the fellow villagers." The next day, he collected the materials hidden in various places and prepared to hand them over. Erchou said: "Who is good and who is bad, it is divided very clearly, the Communist Party does not mistreat people." Conflicts also arose within the landlord and rich peasant families. At the meeting, Shi Yangzi's son also raised the opinion of his father scolding his wife. Yin Fuxiang did not finish raising his opinion about his mother at the meeting. After the meeting, his wife said: "Why didn't you finish raising it at the meeting? She is usually so harsh to us!" Lei Qingtang also muttered to himself: "We are bad, and good people are treated differently." The peasants were all elated and generally reflected: "Fair, so fair, who is good and who is bad is divided so clearly, whatever class should be classified is classified, no one is wronged." After this class division, it truly achieved uniting the peasants, dividing the landlords, and isolating a small number of bad elements. Comrade Huo Fan of the Prefectural Committee said: "This class division is of great educational significance to me. I deeply feel that power is based on the foundation of truth. Feudalism cannot be eliminated by a few activists and a few slogans; the more thoroughly the party's policies are implemented, the greater the power." After more than ten days of class division, the first list has been posted: four landlord households, sixteen exploiting landlord households, twenty-three old rich peasant households, two new rich peasant households, two hundred and seven middle peasant households, one hundred and ninety-five poor peasant households, nine small merchant households, and five worker households. Landlords and rich peasants account for 9.5 percent of the village's 461 households. (Song Anxiang, Sun Chengwen)

    按事实，讲道理，反对“左”倾！
    ——元氏新区池村初划阶级经验
    元氏池村是新区的一个村子，该村的划阶级是在摸索中前进，划阶级的进程中有许多曲折复杂的问题。该村划阶级中，在工作组、贫农团、群众中进行了激烈的反“左”和反对技术观点，使群众了解划阶级的标准、意义和办法，并在划的当中及时的进行了策略教育，使群众真正掌握了划阶级的武器，划阶级形成了群众性的运动，提高了群众的阶级觉悟，达到了团结农民分化地主的目的。兹将其中主要问题写出以供各地参考：
    （一）把划阶级的武器交给群众掌握。
    划阶级一定要有群众性的骨干，使全体群众酝酿成熟，把划阶级的武器教给群众，熟练的掌握起来，这是划阶级胜败与否的关键问题。工作团领导上对此一问题特别重视，除在组织贫农团中讲阶级宣传阶级外，于三月二十二日开了划阶级训练班，有贫雇六十二人、中农二十人。大家一致认识了阶级划不好啥事也没法办，在群众要求下展开划阶级学习，内容主要是分别富农与中农的八原则，划阶级的主要标准是看土地、看剥削、看劳动。划具体户学习后，大家情绪很高。决定拿出两天时间宣传划阶级，八十二个受过训的都成了讲阶级的宣传员，经过两天的宣传，贫农团三百七十七人，有三分之二以上学会了划阶级的标准，群众对划阶级非常关心。中农听了不把一个自己人划成敌人，感到共产党做事真公道，也卷入学习划阶级的运动中。
    （二）死扣八条，情绪“左”，多树敌人。
    二十五日开始划阶级，首先由贫农团吸收少数中农划地富，这时群众对划阶级的策略性不明确，再加上工作团干部“左”的情绪，形成了单纯找地主找富农，死扣八条。李旦八口人，卅三亩地，外甥小时带十五亩地合到一块（为拉拔他的外甥），计算时把他外甥当做长工，十五亩地当做剥削，划为富农。武狗说：“光划富农哩，还得看土地，按地伢是中农。”别的一些人说：“你想包庇他！”“包庇”这顶帽子把群众压住了，不敢展开民主的争论。多数人提某人是中农，少数人敢说是富农。少数人说某人是富农，就是中农也没人敢吭了。工作团郭相林同志划出一户地主富农就高兴，不是地主富农就觉着白费了工夫。在“左”的情绪压力下，不能展开正确的民主争论，划阶级就形成了简单的技术工作。念到一个人不谈事实，光说个“地主”、“富农”，“通过”，就算过去了。划的当中，把一个短工就顶三个工，妇女不顶劳力。结果是划出二十三户地主，四十九户富农，地富占全村百分之十七点四。有的贫雇看见满院子净是“地主富农”，很惊讶的说：“啊呀，那么多一堆人！”
    （三）开展内部思想斗争，反“左”倾。
    经过这次划阶级之后，工作团即结合贫委会小组长和一些好的团员，研究这次划阶级的毛病，开始大家还以为划的不坏，霍泛同志即拿出中央划阶级草案读给大家，读了几节，村干部正在静静的听，工作团有些干部即把头一扭说：“不行，这样子不行，这样划就没地主富农了，穷人怎翻身？”村干部则感到：费了这样大的气力弄错了，没法再改。霍泛同志说明我们对划阶级文件必须好好研究，引导大家展开了争论。经过争论之后，大家感到这次划阶级的毛病是：（一）对被划户的劳力计算的太低，对长工短工劳力计算的过高。如一个短工顶三个工，侯不冷的长工只能顶半个劳力，也算成了一个。（二）按人格，看行为，这样把当过伪保长和联保主任的中农侯黑小、赵保元划为地主。（三）想吃肥，谁有了就想斗谁，把劳动起家的师群山划为地主，中农董庆云划为富农。（四）光看剥削没照顾了孤寡，结果把寡妇尹鸡泽，瞎子尹湾子划成了富农（后改为中农）。（五）光看劳动不看土地，破落十余年，不务正业的师禄子（房没一间、地没一垄）划为地主（改后为“流氓分子”）。接着就研究“左”的根源，“左”好不好，到底谁“左”，群众是否要求“左”？经过研究，大家认识到群众是讲理的，只有少数群众要求“左”，最基本的是工作团干部在整编中对“左”的幼稚，对于“左”对群众的危害没认识透。对“左”的思想情绪没有彻底清算。从贫雇反映：“啊呀！真怕呀！那么多一堆人！”说明了“左”是没有好处的，群众并不要求“左”，不愿多树敌。思想打通之后，就结合各街委员、组长、好的团员，逐户审查地主富农，让他们首先知道为什么某人划为地主，某人划为富农，或不应该当地主、富农，让他们事先多知道一些道理。这一点很重要，对培养贫农团领导核心有很大意义。与此同时，又划了一次中贫农阶级，又划出不少过去错认为中农的贫农。于是又发展了贫农团员九十八人，共增至四百七十五人。
    （四）摆事实，讲道理，人人服气。
    接着就由贫农团和中农一起重新审查阶级，改正错订成份，提出“讲事实，说道理，谁也不能拿大帽子压人，不冤枉一个人；划错了就打了自己人，增多了敌人。”接着就以土地占有和生产关系为标准，重新审查阶级，群众展开了热烈的争论。讨论后，决定在群众大会上让地主富农也参加，划他们的阶级，他们也可提出不同意的意见。这时群众情绪很紧张，调查事实，到会上讲理。地富听说要说理，就也暗暗集会商讨对付办法。他们咯吵着：“说理就沾，咱们到会上给他讲理去！”群众做了调查之后，就在大会上划阶级，首先划罪恶较大的雷庆堂，会上让他自己报告家庭情况，剥削事实，他态度非常强硬：“我就有这几亩家产，别的没啥，乡亲们看着吧！”群众就给他讲道理：“你雇两个长工，自己就一个劳力，还放棉花帐，八百斤顶一千斤，这不是剥削是啥？”庆海也把父亲多年的冤屈倒出来了：“你强占俺十八亩地，一处房，逼的俺爹上吊，把俺爹锁到屋里，给一把刀一条绳，你说就这两桩，愿意怎死就怎死。”群众把他的剥削罪恶事实一条一条说出后，问他哪个不合事实，铁的事实他也没法辩驳，有气无力的答道：“乡亲们说的都是事实，一点不冤我。”经他本人同意，划成富农。划师九峰时，群众提了意见诉了苦，按他三人六十亩地，自己不劳动，雇两个长工、一个做饭的，划成经营地主。这次划阶级，地主富农不同意的意见都提出来了，但不合事实的诡辩都被群众拿事实的证据驳倒了。事实证明，群众大会上公开划阶级让地主富农参加说理，非但压不住农民，反而使农民更加团结，划阶级前更有调查，更有准备，真正做到了摆事实，讲道理。从道理上、思想上征服了地主，发动了农民，使划阶级形成群众诉苦斗争运动，启发了群众的阶级觉悟。另方面，对地富家庭内部进行了分化，会上着重说明了地主为啥没收，富农为啥征收多余部分，新富农为啥只动多余的地，说明党对各个阶层不同的待遇，群众普遍反映：“共产党说真理，人人不亏。”师群山开始划为地主，群众反映群山劳动起家对长工对乡亲挺好，现在不劳动，因六十多岁，又叫大车压坏了，后来就在群众大会上把群山划为劳动起家的新富农。师二丑常年劳动，其弟师官春游手好闲，开始全家划为富农，二丑说：我吃了官春的亏，他要象我这样劳动，成不了富农。后又把师二丑个人划为中农，师官春划为经营地主。尹福祥有个继母，他在家受气，经常劳动，处于被剥削地位；他家庭划成地主，富祥个人不当地主看，成份另划。师瑞山之子明合在家劳动受气，也另眼看待；师羊子之子也另眼看待。这样划分之后，地富阶级及其家庭起了很大分化，师群山说：“共产党真说理，乡亲们对起我，我不能对不住乡亲。”第二天就把分藏在各地的物资收集到一块准备交出。二丑说：“谁好谁坏，分的真清，共产党不亏人。”地富家庭也起了矛盾，大会上师羊子之子把他爹扒他老婆的意见也提出来了。尹福祥在会上对他娘的意见没提完，会后他老婆说：“你在会上怎么不提完？平常她对咱那样刻薄！”雷庆堂也自语：“咱就是坏，好的人都另眼看了。”农民个个兴高采烈，普遍反映：“公道真公道，谁好谁坏分的真清，该划啥阶级划成啥阶级，一人不屈。”经过这次划阶级，真正做到了团结农民，分化地主，孤立了少数坏分子。地委霍泛同志说：“这次划阶级对我教育意义很大，我深感到威力是建立在真理基础上的，不是几个积极分子几句口号可以消灭封建；党的政策愈执行的彻底，威力愈大。”经过十多天的划阶级，已贴出了第一次榜：地主四户，经营地主十六户，旧富农二十三户，新富农二户，中农二百零七户，贫农一百九十五户，小商贩九户，工人五户。地主富农占全村四百六十一户的百分之九点五。（宋安祥、孙成文）
