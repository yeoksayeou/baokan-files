　　Changzhi News: Merchants on Lower East Street in the Third District of Changzhi City, after reviewing past deviations in industry and commerce, earnestly publicized the industrial and commercial policies, dispelling the fear of development among business people. Qin Yushuo said, "Last year, cadres asked me to invest in production, but I didn't dare. I only invested 20,000 yuan, fearing that large-scale development would make me a target for struggle, and that cadres would label me as selfish. After discussing the industrial and commercial policies these past few days, my courage has grown. I and Yang Kecheng and four others started a small shop, combined with transportation, and I invested over 200,000 yuan alone." Hao Wanyong and Wu Dongzhi said, "In the past, the six of us had a small mountain goods stall, and we were only afraid of growing too big and having masses invest. After these few days, knowing the industrial and commercial policies, we bought another Tonghexing store and plan to operate it well in conjunction with the Liuhe flour mill." Wang Erzhao and Wang Jingshan used to always say there was no way, but this time the two of them took out 160,000 yuan to do business. Before the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, there were eight businesses, large and small, on the whole street, with a total capital of over 2.1 million yuan. After publicizing the policy of protecting industry and commerce and developing private capital, three more shops have been added recently, and the capital has increased by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Everyone is still developing.

　　Handan News: Recently, the democratic government has earnestly implemented many concrete measures to protect industrial and commercial policies. Handan merchants have begun to understand the spirit of the policies and generally reflect that "the government's policy of protecting industry and commerce is really good." For example, after the municipal government issued two announcements, merchants read them in groups in front of the announcements, some reading them several times in a row. To take care of the merchants, the merchants were not allowed to participate in this railway repair, and the merchants said: "This is really letting us merchants do business well." In particular, the cancellation of the travel permit made the merchants say: This is a real liberation, and our liberated areas are even stronger. The Municipal Public Security Bureau's improved public security measures are very good, and this time the travel permit has been completely cancelled, and the government is really calling for the development of industry and commerce. In addition, they also have concerns and doubts: they are afraid that the lower levels will not implement it seriously, and problems will occur when going out, and they are afraid that the rural inspection will be impossible. For example, Xu Dengke from West Street said: Without proof, there is no way. It is better to bring the People's Daily of April 10th, which ordered the cancellation of the travel permit, and let whoever checks it read the newspaper. (Li Qiang)

　　长治三区下东街商人
    懂清了工商业政策纷纷集资发展营业
    【长治消息】长治市三区下东街，检查了以往在工商业上的偏向，认真的宣传了工商业政策，打破了商民群众怕发展的思想。秦鱼锁说：“去年干部叫我入股搞生产，我也不敢，只入了二万元，恐怕发展大成了斗争对象啦，又怕干部给戴自私自利的帽子。经过这几天讨论工商业政策，我才胆壮了。我和杨科成等五人，搞了个小商店，结合运输，我一个人就入了二十多万元”。郝万永、武冬只说：“我们过去六个人搞的小山货摊，只恐怕发展大，只怕群众入股，经过这几天，知道了工商业政策，我们又买了一座同合兴商店，结合六合粉坊打算好好经营。”王二召、王景山以前总是说没有办法，这一次二人就拿出来了十六万元搞买卖。土地法大纲公布前，全街大小买卖共八座，共有资本二百一十多万元，经过宣传保护工商业政策，发展私人资本，近又增加了三座商店，资本就增加了三四十万元，现在大家还在发展。

    【邯郸消息】最近民主政府认真执行保护工商业政策的许多具体措施，邯郸商人开始体会到了政策精神，普遍反映：“政府保护工商业政策真是好”。如市政府两次布告出来后，商人成群结队的在布告前阅读，有的一连念了好几遍。为照顾商人，这次修铁路未让商人参加，商人说：“这真是让咱们商人好好作生意哩。”特别是取消了路条，商人说：这一下可真解放了，咱们解放区就是更强大了。市公安局改进公安办法就很好了，这次路条又彻底取消了，政府真正叫发展工商业哩。另外他们也还有顾虑和怀疑：怕下边不认真执行，出外发生问题，怕乡村检查没办法。如西街徐登科说：没有证明没办法，不如带上四月十日那张通令取消路条的人民日报，谁查让谁看报纸。　　　（李强）
