Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 10th. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, in order to restore and promote the development of industry and commerce severely damaged by the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandits and to prosper the economy, issued a proclamation on March 31st stating: (1) Resolutely implement the policy of protecting industry and commerce. All industrial and commercial enterprises that have suffered significant damage from the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandit troops, whether public or private, should be encouraged and assisted in resuming business in accordance with the government's policy of protecting industry and commerce. In the land reform, conscientiously implement Article 12 of the Land Law Outline, regarding the provision that "the property of industrialists and businessmen and their legitimate business shall not be infringed." The industry and commerce operated by landlords and rich peasants are equally protected. Those whose industry and commerce have been infringed upon due to wrongly determined class status and have not yet been corrected, should be corrected promptly and losses should be compensated. For those who still have concerns and hoard goods,不敢营业,宣传解释,鼓励其恢复营业. All industrial and commercial loans and debts should be protected. The government should protect and reward factories and workshops, whether operated in partnership or individually. (2) This year (1948), commercial tax will be exempted (regardless of fixed or mobile operations). Those who are mainly engaged in agriculture but also engage in industry and commerce will only have their agricultural income calculated when collecting public grain, and the industrial and commercial part will not be taxed. (3) The property of industrialists and businessmen and their legitimate business shall be protected by the laws of the border region. If infringed, industrialists and businessmen may file a complaint with the government's judicial organs in accordance with the law.
