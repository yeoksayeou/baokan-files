The Northwest People's Liberation Army finally recovered the democratic holy land of Yan'an on April 22nd. The development of the Northwest War situation in the one year, one month, and three days since our voluntary withdrawal from Yan'an on March 19, 1936, has proved what the Xinhua News Agency editorial pointed out last April: "Chiang's army's occupation of Yan'an will mark the demise of Chiang Kai-shek, and the People's Liberation Army's abandonment of Yan'an will mark the victory of the Chinese people." After our voluntary withdrawal from Yan'an on March 19th, the operation led by our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to annihilate Hu Zongnan's bandit army fully commenced in arduous and challenging circumstances.

The following are some major victories in this one year, one month, and three days (as for the achievements of the local troops fighting arduously behind enemy lines, they have not yet been calculated):

March 25, 1947, one week after our voluntary withdrawal from Yan'an, the Liberation Army completely annihilated the 31st Brigade headquarters and one regiment, totaling more than 4,000 bandits, in a short two-hour battle at Qinghuabian (70 miles northeast of Yan'an). On April 14th, our army, in the Yangmahe (30 miles south of Wayaobao) campaign, annihilated nearly 5,000 bandits of the 135th Brigade within eight hours. At that time, the Xinhua News Agency editorial pointed out: "The annihilation of the 135th Brigade marks the beginning of Hu bandit's decline."

From May 3rd to 4th, in the Panlong (90 miles north of Yan'an) campaign, we broke through Hu bandit's Panlong supply point, which had heavily fortified defensive positions, and completely annihilated 7,500 bandits of Hu bandit's elite 167th Brigade. At that time, the Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on this victory: "The development of the war situation proves that Hu bandit's ferocity is declining, and Hu bandit's incompetence is making this decline faster, more drastic, and more dramatic."

From May 30th to July 7th, in the Longdong Sanbian campaign, the 81st Division and other units of the Ningqing Sanma feudal warlords suffered a devastating blow from our army and fled in disarray. Our army also recovered a vast area of 350 miles from north to south and 370 miles from east to west on the western front of the border area. "After defeating Hu bandit's accomplices, the Liberation Army won excellent conditions for completely eliminating Hu bandit in the future" (Xinhua News Agency reporter's comment on the Longdong Sanbian campaign).

On August 20th, in the Shajiadian campaign in Mizhi, our army completely annihilated the entire 123rd Brigade and most of the 165th Brigade, as well as the headquarters of the 36th Division of Chiang Hu bandit's army, totaling more than 6,000 people, within a few hours. The 36th Division was one of the three main divisions of Hu bandit. After the division was annihilated, Hu bandit's direct troops only had fourteen brigades left, and its mobile troops did not exceed seven brigades. The Xinhua News Agency reporter pointed out in the commentary: The annihilation of the 36th Division marks the beginning of the counter-offensive by the Liberation Army on the Northwest battlefield, and the Northwest war situation has fundamentally changed. The beginning of the counter-offensive by the Northwest People's Liberation Army is also the beginning of a new stage in the liberation of the Great Northwest.

On October 2nd, in the Yanchuan and Yanchang campaign, our army completely annihilated the 2nd Battalion of the 35th Regiment of the 13th Brigade, the 2nd Battalion of the 70th Regiment of the 24th Brigade, and the security police column, totaling more than 1,400 people. At the same time, our counter-offensive army advanced southward and opened up new liberated areas in Guanzhong, which had been ruled by Hu Zongnan for more than ten years.

From October 6th to 11th, in the Qingjian campaign, our army completely annihilated the headquarters and directly subordinate units of the 76th Division, the headquarters and directly subordinate units of the 24th Brigade, the entire 70th Regiment, and one battalion of the 72nd Regiment, totaling more than 5,300 people. From October 12th to 13th, in the Hancheng campaign, our army annihilated the regimental headquarters and its two battalions of the 158th Regiment of the 53rd Brigade of the 90th Division, two companies of the field artillery battalion of the 78th Brigade of the First Division, and two battalions of the self-defense forces of Hancheng and @ counties, totaling more than 2,300 people. On October 21st, in the Yichuan campaign, our army completely annihilated the Yichuan command headquarters, the 27th Regiment of the New 9th Brigade of the 39th Division of the Sichuan Army, the 182nd Regiment of the 61st Brigade of the 90th Division of the Hu Army, one company of the field artillery battalion of the 78th Brigade of the First Division, and the Chiang Kai-shek security police teams of Yichuan, Yanchang, and Gulin counties, totaling more than 4,000 people.

This year in March, the Northwest Liberation Army marched into the Chiang-controlled area. From March 1st to 3rd, in the Yichuan campaign, our army completely annihilated the headquarters of the 29th Army, the 90th Division, the headquarters of the 27th Division, and the five entire brigades under their jurisdiction, including the 31st Brigade, the 47th Brigade, the 53rd Brigade, the 61st Brigade, and the 24th Brigade of the 76th Division, totaling 30,000 people. The spokesperson of the People's Liberation Army Headquarters pointed out that this campaign was the first major victory on the Northwest battlefield, "changing the situation of the balance of power between the enemy and us in the Northwest." "After this campaign, Hu Zongnan only had twenty-three brigades left, distributed in Linfen, the Yu-Shaan-E battlefield, and the 'T'-shaped transportation line from Tongguan to Baoji and Xianyang to Yan'an. Most of them were assigned to defense duties and had been annihilated or suffered devastating blows by us, and their combat effectiveness was extremely weak."

Following the Yichuan victory, our army continued to advance into the southern part of the Huanglong sub-district, capturing ten cities in a row, cutting off the Xian-Yu Highway, and completing the strategic encirclement of the isolated cities of Luochuan and Yan'an. Hu bandit pieced together 80,000 troops to relieve the siege of Luochuan, but on April 16th, they were blocked by us and turned south to flee.

On April 17th, our powerful corps suddenly advanced into the vast area of Jingwei, cutting off the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, capturing @yi, Yongshou, @xian, Changwu, Linwu, Fufeng, and Lingtai, seven cities, annihilating the 3rd Regiment of the 203rd Division of the Youth Army and some local troops, totaling more than 5,000 people, and is now continuing to expand the offensive fiercely.

In total, since the Northwest People's Liberation Army withdrew from Yan'an until it recovered Yan'an, it annihilated a total of one army headquarters (the 29th Army headquarters), five division headquarters (the 81st Division, the 36th Division, the 76th Division, the 27th Division, and the 90th Division), six brigade headquarters (the 31st Brigade twice, the 24th Brigade twice, the 167th Brigade, and the 47th Brigade), seven entire brigades (the 135th Brigade, the 31st Brigade, the Provisional 60th Brigade, the 123rd Brigade, the 165th Brigade, the 53rd Brigade, and the 61st Brigade), fifteen entire regiments, ten entire battalions, and nine entire companies of regular troops above the company level. Excluding the army and division headquarters, it totaled the equivalent of fourteen brigades, one regiment, and one company. Including the annihilated strength below the company level, it annihilated a total of 89,096 regular troops. A total of three entire regiments, eight entire battalions, and six entire companies of non-regular troops above the company level were annihilated. Including the strength below the company level, it annihilated a total of 10,041 non-regular troops. The above two items totaled 99,137 enemies annihilated. Among them, 63,604 were captured, 35,213 were killed or wounded, and 320 were persuaded to revolt (Northwest People's Liberation Army Front Headquarters announced a comprehensive achievement report for the first anniversary of the withdrawal from Yan'an). In addition, the Northwest People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to advance into the Chiang-controlled area and annihilated the 3rd Regiment of the 203rd Division of the Hu bandit and local bandits, totaling more than 5,000 people. In total, we annihilated more than 104,000 enemies.

Twenty-six enemy generals were captured or killed: (A) Twenty-one enemy generals were captured, including three lieutenant generals of regular troops (Liao Ang, commander of the 76th Division, Liu Ziqi, commander of the 123rd Brigade, and Xu Yongxiu, commander-in-chief of Yichuan).

    一年一月又三天
    新华社
    西北人民解放军四月二十二日终于收复了民主圣地延安。从三十六年三月十九日我主动撤离延安至今，一年一月零三天的西北战局发展证明了去年四月新华社社论所指出的：“蒋军侵占延安将标志着蒋介石的灭亡，人民解放军的放弃延安将标志着中国人民的胜利”。三月十九日我主动撤离延安后，我党中央和毛主席亲率的歼灭胡宗南匪军的作战，就在艰苦卓绝的环境下全面揭幕。
    以下就是这一年零一个月又三天中几个大的战绩（至于在敌后艰苦奋斗的地方部队战绩，还未来得及计算在内。）：
    一九四七年三月二十五日即我主动撤出延安后一周，解放军即在清化砭（延安东北七十里），以二小时的短促战斗，全歼匪三十一旅旅部和一个团共四千余人。四月十四日我军又在羊马河（瓦窑堡南三十里）战役，于八小时内歼灭匪一三五旅近五千人。当时新华社社论指出：“一三五旅的歼灭，标志着胡匪从此走下坡路。”
    五月三日至四日蟠龙（延安北九十里）战役，我们突破胡匪筑有强大纵深堡垒群的蟠龙补给点，全歼胡匪精锐一六七旅七千五百余人。当时新华社记者在评论此次胜利中指出：“战局的发展证明胡匪凶焰是在下降，而胡匪的指挥无能使这个下降来得更快，更剧烈，更富于戏剧性。”
    五月三十日至七月七日陇东三边战役，宁青三马封建军阀之八十一师等部遭我歼灭性打击，狼狈逃窜。我军并收复边区西线南北长三百五十里、东西宽三百七十里广大地区。“解放军在击溃胡匪这批帮凶后，就赢得了今后全部消灭胡匪的优越条件”（新华社记者评陇东三边战役）。
    八月二十日米脂沙家店战役，我军于数小时内全歼蒋胡匪军整三六师师部，一二三旅全部及一六五旅大部共六千余人。三六师是胡匪三个主力师之一，该师就歼后，胡匪军嫡系兵力只余十四个旅，其机动兵力已不超过七个旅。新华社记者在评论中指出：三六师的歼灭标志着解放军在西北战场上开始了反攻，西北战局已经根本改变。西北人民解放军反攻的开始，也就是大西北解放之新阶段的开始。
    十月二日延川、延长战役，我军全歼敌一三旅之三五团二营，二四旅之七○团二营及保警纵队，共一千四百余人。与此同时我反攻大军向南挺进，在胡宗南统治了十多年的大关中开辟了新的解放区。
    十月六日至十一日清涧战役，我军全歼敌整七十六师师部、师直属队，二四旅旅部、旅直属队，七○团全部及七二团一个营，共五千三百余名。十月十二日至十三日韩城战役，我军歼整九○师五三旅一五八团团直及其两个营，第一师七八旅野炮营两个连及韩、＠两县自卫队两个营，共二千三百余名。十月二十一日宜川战役，我军全歼守敌宜川指挥部，川军三九师新九旅二七团，胡军九○师六一旅一八二团，第一师七八旅野炮营一个连，及宜川、延长、固临三县蒋记保警队等四千余人。
    今年三月西北解放军向蒋管区进军，三月一日至三日，宜川战役我军全歼蒋胡匪整二十九军军部、整九十师、二十七师师部及其所辖之三一旅、四七旅、五三旅、六一旅、七六师之二四旅等五个整旅，共三万人。人民解放军总部发言人指出这一战役是在西北战场上的第一个大胜利，“改变了西北敌我对比形势”。“经过这次战役胡宗南只剩下二十三个旅，分布在临汾，豫陕鄂战场及潼关到宝鸡、咸阳到延安的‘丁’字形交通线上，绝大部分都是分任守备，而且都被我歼灭过或受过我歼灭性打击，战力极弱。”
    继宜川大捷后，我军续向黄龙分区南部挺进，连克十城，截断咸榆公路，完成对洛川、延安孤城的战略包围，胡匪拚凑八万之众图解洛川之围，四月十六日遭我阻击掉头南逃。
    四月十七日我强大兵团突然挺进泾渭广大地区，切断西兰公路，攻占＠邑、永寿、＠县、长武、麟游、扶风、灵台七城，歼青年军二○三师第三团及土杂等一部共五千余人，现正继续猛烈扩张攻势中。
    总计西北人民解放军自撤离延安至收复延安止，共歼敌整连以上正规军共一个军部（整二九军军部），五个师部（整八一师、整三六师、整七六师、整二七师、整九○师），六个旅部（整三一旅两次、整二四旅两次、整一六七旅、整四七旅），七个整旅（整一三五旅、整三一旅、暂六○旅、整一二三旅、整一六五旅、整五三旅、整六一旅），十五个整团，十个整营，九个整连。除军部、师部不计外，共折合十四个旅、一个团、又一个连，将连以下被歼兵力计算在内，共歼敌正规军八万九千零九十六名。歼敌整连以上非正规军共三个整团，八个整营，六个整连。将连以下兵力计算在内，共歼敌非正规军一万零四十一名。以上两项合计，共歼敌九万九千一百三十七名。内生俘六万三千六百零四名，毙伤三万五千二百一十三名，争取起义三百二十名（西北人民解放军前线司令部公布撤出延安一周年综合战绩）。加上此次西北人民解放军乘胜向蒋管区进军，歼灭胡匪二○三师第三团及土顽等共五千余人。总计我共歼敌十万零四千余人。
    俘毙敌将级军官二十六名：（甲）俘敌将级军官二十一名，内正规军中将三名（整七六师师长廖昂、整一二三旅旅长刘子奇、宜川总指挥许用修）。少将十四名（整三一旅旅长李纪云、副旅长周贵昌、整一三五旅代旅长麦宗禹、整一六七旅旅长李＠岗、副旅长涂健、骑二旅副旅长陈应权、整二四旅旅长张新、张汉初、整七六师参谋长刘学超、新闻室主任曹锡武、整二九军参谋长刘振世、整二七师副师长李奇亨、整九十师参谋长曾文思、整五三旅副旅长李秀岭）。非正规军少将三名（陕北警备副司令张子英、＠县指挥部少将指挥官赵璋、陕西第七区专员兼少将保安司令乔维森），另俘伪行政督察专员一名（陕西第二行政区专员阎崇师）。（乙）毙敌将级军官五名，内正规军中将两名（整二九军军长刘戡、整九十师师长严明），少将二名（整三一旅旅长周由之、整四七旅旅长李达），非正规军中将一名（陕西保安第二纵队长兼陕西第八行政区专员李侠）。
    收复与解放城镇三十一座，即：横山、葭县、米脂、绥德、吴堡、清涧、子长（安定）、靖边、志丹（保安）、安塞、延川、延长、甘泉、夏县、环县、府谷、神木、宜川、白水、黄陵（中部）、黄龙（县治设石辅镇）、韩城、＠阳、＠邑、永寿、＠县、长武、延安、麟游、灵台、扶风（以上新设县如固临、赤水等及收复与解放后又主动撤出者如合水、耀县、宜君、澄城等均未计入）。原边区所属县城现尚在敌手者有定边、盐池、合水、庆阳等四座。
