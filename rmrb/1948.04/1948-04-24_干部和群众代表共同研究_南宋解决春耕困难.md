　　Cadres and Mass Representatives Jointly Study
  　Nansong Solves Spring Ploughing Difficulties
    [Changzhi News] After reviewing their work, cadres in the Nansong District of the Fifth District are determined to establish a new work style and properly lead the masses in production. In organizing spring ploughing, they discovered five problems: first, the issue of plowing on behalf of others; second, the issue of labor exchange; third, the issue of childless and widowed individuals being unable to participate in mutual aid; fourth, the issue of communal feeding of livestock; and fifth, the issue of the spring famine. The lack of appropriate solutions to these five problems was hindering the progress of spring ploughing. On the eighth of this month, more than 200 people, including cadres and one mass representative from every ten households, took advantage of the rainy weather to conduct group research and discussions for three days and four nights, resulting in good solutions to the above problems.
    The issue of plowing on behalf of others was improperly handled in the past, with all military families being provided with this service regardless of whether they had labor difficulties. The solution is for the leadership to first encourage the households being plowed for to do as much labor themselves as possible to reduce the labor burden on the masses. On the spot, three honorably discharged veterans volunteered to forego plowing on their behalf, influencing twelve other military families to also cultivate their own land. Whether or not other military families should have their land plowed on their behalf should be determined by two standards: first, their economic situation, and second, whether or not they have labor; and then the amount of labor to be provided on their behalf, whether paid or unpaid, should be specifically decided through discussion by everyone. Regarding the issue of labor exchange, the distribution of labor and animal power was unfair, with no distinction made between strong and weak labor and animal power when determining shares. After discussion, it was decided to stipulate differences of thirty, twenty, and ten-plus points (to reward households raising livestock, a pair of animals will not be subject to corvée labor). Corvée labor with animals involves traveling sixty li and pulling one hundred jin, counting as one labor unit, earning three and eight-tenths sheng of rice (including human labor). The more one pulls, the more one earns; plowing one mu of land earns three sheng of rice (including human labor). Human labor is assigned differences of twelve, ten, and eight points, with each point worth three he of rice. Everyone is very satisfied with this arrangement.
    Regarding the issue of households with labor being unwilling to engage in mutual aid with households without labor, cadres and activists are educated to consider whether the loss of unharvested grain from uncultivated land by households without labor would be detrimental to production. Widowed and childless households should also provide equal value exchange of wages, spinning yarn, and sewing to substitute for labor, so that both parties can be absorbed into the mutual aid groups. The issue of communal feeding of livestock was a major problem in the past, with people using the animals but not feeding them, and people not making furniture, resulting in livestock becoming thin and weak. Two families had already sold their livestock. This problem was discussed and four specific solutions were reached: (1) rely on dedicated people to use and feed the animals (to reward the feeding households, they can draw three animal labor units per month, with the manure belonging to the feeding household), but the animals must be fed to be fat; (2) implement a work point system for animal use, such as three families feeding one donkey, with the animal assigned six hundred points per month, and each family receiving two hundred points; whoever plows the land for one day earns twenty points for the animal, and at the end of the month, whoever has more work points gets more rice, and whoever has fewer work points gives rice; (3) fodder is shared, with mules and horses assigned three sheng per day and donkeys two sheng; (4) livestock and furniture are purchased jointly.
    The entire village has only over 380 households, and currently, six households have nothing to eat. Because the village has no fruit or charity granary, after discussion, it was still decided to implement mutual lending. Everyone was immediately asked to report the amount of grain they could lend, and a total of more than four shi of grain was lent, solving the difficulties of nine households with insufficient or no food. It was also decided to lend 72 mu of public land to seven poor and landless households to plant.
    After these specific problems in spring ploughing were resolved, everyone actively organized to carry out production.

### 干部和群众代表共同研究　南宋解决春耕困难

　　干部和群众代表共同研究
  　南宋解决春耕困难
    【长治消息】五区南宋干部经过检讨后，决心树立新作风好好领导群众生产，在组织进行春耕中，发现有五个问题：一是代耕问题。二是变工问题。三是没劳力孤寡参加不了互助问题。四是伙喂牲口问题。五是春荒问题。这五个问题没有适当解决，阻碍着春耕进行。本月八日由干部及每十户一个群众代表共二百余人，趁天雨经三天四夜的分组研究讨论，把上述问题得到很好的解决。
    代耕问题，过去是不妥当的，不管有无劳力困难，凡是军属一样代耕。解决办法是领导上首先启发被代耕户尽量自己劳动，减轻群众劳力负担，当场有三个荣退军人自报不用代耕，影响其他十二户军属也自己耕种。其余军属应否代耕要看两个标准：一是经济情况，二是劳力有无，再具体决定代耕劳力数，有代价或是无代价，大家讨论。变工问题，劳力、畜力定分不公道，劳力、畜力不按强弱，定分是一样。经讨论决定规定为三十分、二十余，十余分之差（为奖励养牲口户，一对牙牲口不支差），牲口支差是走六十里，拉一百斤为一工，挣米三升八（人力在内），多拉多挣，犁一亩地三升米（人力在内），人力定为十二、十、八分之差，每分三合米。这样定分大家很满意。
    有劳力户不愿和无劳力户互助问题，教育干部积极分子无劳力户，荒了地不收粮食对生产有没损失？孤寡户也要等价交换出工资，纺花缝衣来顶工，双方这样由互助组吸收孤寡户参加。伙喂牲口问题，以前很成问题，有人使没人喂，家具没人制，牲口喂成夹板肚，有两家已卖了牲口。这个问题讨论出四点具体办法：（一）靠专人使专人喂（为奖励喂户，每月喂户可抽三个牲口工，粪归喂户），但必须喂胖牲口。（二）使牲口实行工票制，如三家伙喂一个驴，每月牲口定为六百分，每家取上二百分，谁犁一天地牲口挣二十分，月底谁工票多得米，谁工票少出米。（三）草料伙摊，规定骡马每天三升、驴二升。（四）牲口家具伙买。
    全村只有三百八十余户，目下没吃的有六户。因这村果实、义仓都没有经讨论还是实行互借，当场让大家自报借粮，共借出四石余粮食，解决了九户少吃或没吃的困难，并决定把七十二亩公地借给七户少地的贫雇种上。
    这些春耕中具体问题得到解决后，大家纷纷组织进行生产。
