[Lu Cheng News] In Huangniuti Village, Second District, cadres and masses were very confused when the Land Law was issued. Village cadres, due to their undemocratic style in the years of the emancipation movement, embezzling fruits, and issuing orders by arbitrary decision, faced many complaints from the poor masses who had not been thoroughly emancipated. Individual hooligan elements took the opportunity to make trouble, deliberately scaring people, frightening the cadres so much that they couldn't even eat, lying in bed waiting, and hating themselves. When the work team arrived, Liang Jingquan jumped off a cliff, fortunately not fatally. Gen Chou said, "After being a cadre for eight or nine years, I've become a target of struggle." Public Security Director Tian Xinyou said, "I've returned the excess fruit I took, and I'm correcting my bad work style, but I'm still afraid of being beaten by the masses." Hooligan elements also told the middle peasants that this year they would be communized and everything would be divided equally. Some middle peasant households were so frightened that they started calculating, "Now it's my turn." They ate and drank extravagantly every day and didn't want to deliver manure. If they didn't deliver, they were afraid people would say they were sabotaging the Land Law; if they delivered it to the fields, they were afraid it would be divided equally, so they delivered the manure halfway. Wang Banze's mother, an orphan, had hired people for a few days because she had no labor. Hearing that hiring people would lead to struggle, she ate extravagantly every day. Recently, because the work team had too many base points to manage, they withdrew from this one. The village then shifted its focus to production, simultaneously publicizing the Land Law and the announcement of "whoever cultivates the land owns it," publicizing the democratic rectification of the Party in various places and Comrade Ren Bishi's "Several Questions in Land Reform," and having the masses and cadres discuss them. At the same time, they used practical actions to break through the muddled thinking of the masses and cadres. For example, in the past, production was led only by a few main cadres; this time, the masses democratically elected a production committee, resulting in the election of fifteen people, including men and women, cadres, and middle and poor peasants. When solving spring plowing difficulties, they not only took care of the poor and hired laborers but also took care of the middle peasants. Middle peasant Wang Yuanshui wanted to borrow 40,000 yuan to buy an old ox, and it was approved, further convincing everyone of the policy. Later, they democratically rectified mutual aid teams and cleared up old mutual aid accounts. In this way, most of the ideological problems were resolved, and the hooligan elements' rumors were shattered. The manure moved halfway was all moved to the fields, and the manure at home was also about to be moved out. The cadres also joined the mutual aid teams and actively led production. Some, because they had many problems in the past, were still not very bold. The village has now voluntarily formed thirty-six male mutual aid teams and thirty-two female textile groups, busy repairing rakes and planting cotton, and women are busy completing their two-month textile plan.

　　用事实打破干群顾虑
  　黄牛蹄村生产情绪提高了
    【潞城消息】二区黄牛蹄村，在土地法下来时，干部群众思想都很混乱。村干部因为在几年翻身运动中，作风不民主，贪污果实，命令包办，贫苦未翻透身的群众对他们有好多意见。个别流氓分子为了报复干部，便乘机捣乱，故意吓唬，吓的干部连饭都吃不进，躺在炕上等待，恨自己。工作队一来，梁景全就跳崖，幸未跌死。根丑说：“当了八九年干部，成了斗争对象啦”。公安主任田新有说：“多占果实退了，作风不好改正，就是怕群众打”。流氓分子又对中农说，今年要共产平分，有的中农户吓得扳指头算，“这可轮到我了”。每天大吃二喝，送粪也不想送。不送恐怕人说是破坏土地法，送到地里又怕平分，便将粪送到半路上。王搬则娘是个孤寡，因无劳力，雇过几天人，听说雇过人就要斗争，每天大吃。工作组最近因为基点多，顾不来，将这一基点撤了，这村就转而以生产为主，一面宣传土地法与谁种谁收布告，宣传各地民主整党与任弼时同志的“土地改革中几个问题”，让群众干部讨论，一面用实际行动打通群众干部糊涂思想。比如过去领导生产，只是几个主要干部领导，这次让群众民主选举生产委员会，结果选举了十五个人，有男有女，有干部，也有中农贫农。解决春耕困难时，不但照顾了贫雇，也照顾了中农。中农王元水想贷四万元买条老牛，也批准了，大家越发相信了政策。以后又民主整顿互助组，清理互助旧帐，这样思想问题大部得到解决，流氓分子的谣言不攻自破，搬到半路上的粪全部移到地里，家里的粪也都快全部搬出。干部也都参加了互助组，积极领导生产，有的因过去有很多毛病，现在还有些不大胆。该村现已自愿结合了男互助组三十六个，妇女纺织组三十二个，忙着修耙地种花，女人忙着完成两个月纺织计划。（王玉珠）
