Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 5th—The privately-owned Huafeng Bank in Shijiazhuang officially started operations on the 19th of last month. Thirty-six cargo and passenger stations, including private businesses like Daxinggong, Tongxingyu, and Yulong, have actively invested, with the largest investment being 2 million yuan (Border Region currency, same below) and the smallest being 150,000 yuan. Private individuals are also enthusiastically investing, with the largest share reaching 3 million yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 5th—In Xinji City, an important commercial town in Central Hebei, industrial and commercial enterprises are expanding their businesses. When land reform was implemented in various regions at the end of last year, it affected the merchants in Xinji City, who doubted the government's policy of protecting industry and commerce. After explanations from the democratic government and the Xinji Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the merchants actively expanded their operations. The Wuchang Oil Shop expanded its capital to more than 8 million yuan. The textile factories Yuansheng, Tongfeng, and Minsheng, the leather factories Zhenxing and Xincheng, and the copper factory Dehua have all increased their workers and purchased machinery. In the recent month or so, twenty-one new shops have opened in the city, including the Xin Da Textile Factory, Fuju Leather Factory, and Fuyuan Oil Shop, with a total capital of 53 million yuan. Nine more, including Huatong Freight Station and Fujucheng Leather Factory, are preparing to open.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 5th—The Botou City Electric Light Company in Central Hebei has recently resumed operations, and the entire city is brightly lit. Flour mills such as Yimin and Yongji, which previously used diesel engines to press oil and grind flour, have now switched to using electricity. Cotton weaving factories such as Limin have increased production by an average of one-third or more. The city's agricultural iron factory is also working on using electric iron rollers to grind flour, preparing for a large increase in production.
