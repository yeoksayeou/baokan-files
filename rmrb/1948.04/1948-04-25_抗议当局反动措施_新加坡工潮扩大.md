Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Singapore dispatch: Two thousand five hundred Chinese dockworkers here went on strike on the 20th in support of the strike struggle of six thousand Indian and Malay harbor workers of the Harbor Administration on the 17th. The strikers are demanding wage increases and the guarantee of democratic rights. Singapore port operations have thus come to a standstill, and thirty ships berthed in the port have ceased loading and unloading cargo. Representatives of the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions (with 50,000 members) declared on the 19th that a general strike would be launched on the 23rd to protest against the authorities' reactionary measures of illegally searching trade unions, arresting strikers, and using scabs to sabotage the strike.
