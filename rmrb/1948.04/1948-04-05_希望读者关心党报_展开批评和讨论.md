　　Hoping Readers Will Care About the Party Newspaper
  　Engage in Criticism and Discussion
    To the Editors:
    The People's Daily has many advantages after the Yetao Conference, but besides the advantages, I feel that the atmosphere of debate is not strong enough, which cannot be said to be a shortcoming. Therefore, I think the editors must pay attention to this point and call on readers to pay attention to, analyze, study, and criticize every piece of news, every article, and every report published in the Party newspaper. Only in this way can our readers care more about the Party newspaper, and only in this way can we improve everyone's sense of responsibility; only in this way can our newspaper make progress.
    It should be admitted that many comrades often express a lot of opinions after reading the newspaper. They either disagree with this statement or have opinions on that article, and these opinions are often correct, but they never publish them to the newspaper, which has to be said to be a regrettable thing. I hope the editors will pay attention to this issue and call on everyone to launch a debate. (Li Cunyi)
Comrade Cunyi:
    We believe that your opinion on the newspaper is very valuable and is a very important issue for the current newspaper. Recently, we have made some efforts in this regard, but it is still far from enough. In our work, we should handle every word and sentence published in the newspaper with the spirit of being responsible to the people of the entire region, but this still has its limitations, and sometimes even one-sidedness. We hope that the broad masses of readers will often pay attention to every piece of news published in the newspaper and put forward criticisms and suggestions at any time, truly forming a mass inspection of the newspaper. Only in this way can the newspaper better serve the people.

    Two Opinions and Questions Regarding the Work of Nanlixin
To the Editors:
    After reading the news "Xiangyuan Nanlixin Work Group Examines Old Work Style" in the March 19th newspaper, I have these two feelings, which are just my own understanding, not necessarily correct. I submit them for your study.
    First, according to the newspaper, in that village: the landlords and rich peasants were overthrown, and the poor and hired peasants turned themselves over, with only two households not completely turned over (because they only returned to the village last autumn). When organizing the poor peasant group, seventeen poor and hired peasants were found. Is this somewhat different from what was said above? If they have all turned themselves over, the village can be said to be the best village in the land reform. I think it is necessary to write about the class changes in that village, the situation of the poor and hired peasants turning themselves over (land, grain production, livestock, houses, life), as well as the current reflections and demands of the masses. Because some comrades are still a bit careless about how to thoroughly turn over the poor and hired peasants, and do not understand it very well. Moreover, there are not many materials exchanged by various places in the newspaper. If we can write out the scale of each poor and hired peasant's turn-over for reference by various places, it would also be very good.
    Second, "Cadres are all suspended from their duties for self-reflection, the masses are mobilized to give opinions to the cadres, the cadres are afraid, and we ask the heads of the poor peasant groups to apologize and compensate the cadres." From these things, the main mistake here is not believing in the masses, not carrying out this work based on the demands of the masses, but doing things according to one's own mind. I think it is a serious mistake to compensate the cadres, and it is a violation of the democratic rights of the masses. The comrades of the Nanlixin Work Group also reviewed the shortcomings of being overbearing and taking over everything in their work. I think the review is not deep enough, and the understanding of the mistakes is not thorough enough. The erroneous thinking in this work has not been exposed. The work inspection should be thoroughly investigated ideologically, and the root cause of the work errors should be found in order to recognize and correct them; otherwise, it will be easy to repeat this error in future work.
    In addition, I have this request for the newspaper. The Taihang Xinhua Newspaper has the editor's opinion after almost every manuscript, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages of the manuscript and what needs to be further studied. I think this is very helpful to readers. Your newspaper also constantly adds editor's opinions. I hope that in the future, the editor's opinion will be added concisely and succinctly after more important manuscripts, which will be of great help to the learning and progress of the comrades.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Xizheng)
Comrade Xizheng:
    We hope that the comrades of the Nanlixin Work Group can study and answer your opinions on the Nanlixin Work Group. Your opinion on this newspaper is very good, and we will work harder in this area in the future.

    Do Not Include Members of the "Dao Hui Men" Sect in the Farmers' Association - This Condition Lacks Class Character
To the Editors:
    After reading the news about the establishment of the new farmers' association in Dachi, Xiangyuan, published on the first page of your newspaper on the 20th of last month, when talking about the conditions for joining the farmers' association, the second of the "four wants and three don'ts" was "don't include members of the Dao Hui Men sect." After research by our work group comrades, we believe that this statement lacks class character. The reason is that the Dao Hui Men is only a religious and superstitious organization, and the members who participate in it have different components, including landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor and hired peasants. We believe that except for landlords and rich peasants, they should be allowed to participate in the farmers' association. The main thing here is to strengthen their class education and enlighten their class consciousness. However, this does not include people with political backgrounds who oppose the equal distribution and oppose our Party's policies. It should be determined specifically according to the individual's situation whether to participate or not, and should not be generalized. Please answer whether this opinion is correct.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Niu Dengda, et al.)
Comrade Dengda:
    Regarding one of the conditions for joining the farmers' association stipulated by Dachi Village, "don't include members of the Dao Hui Men sect," your opinion is correct, and that statement does lack class character. In the process of editing, we also felt that some conditions were problematic, but we did not analyze and criticize them in detail, but only added a general editor's note at the end, saying that the conditions should not become a restriction on organizing the masses, but we failed to raise it to the ideological level for a clear analysis, which was not powerful enough. You clearly pointed this out, which is beneficial to the entire work.
    In addition, I hope that the Dachi Work Group can also study this opinion.

### 希望读者关心党报　展开批评和讨论

专栏：编读往来

　　希望读者关心党报
  　展开批评和讨论编辑同志：
    人民日报在冶陶大会后有许多优点，但除了优点以外，我觉得争论空气很不浓厚，这不能不说是个缺点。因此，我以为编辑同志必须重视这一点，号召读者对党报所登出的每条新闻、每篇文章、每篇报导，加以注意、分析、研究并批评。只有这样，我们的读者大众才更能关心党报，才更能提高大家的责任心；也只有这样，我们的报纸才能进步。
    应该承认，很多同志在看了报纸后，往往大发议论，他们或是不同意这种说法，或是对那篇文章有意见，而这些议论往往又是正确的，但他们却从来不向报社发表，这不能不说是一件憾事，望编辑同志注意这一问题，号召大家展开论战。（李存溢）存溢同志：
    你对报纸的意见，我们认为是很宝贵且是当前报纸很重要的一个问题，最近我们在这方面也作了些努力，但还是十分不够的。在我们工作上应该以对全区人民负责的精神，慎重处理刊载到报上的每字每句，但这究竟还有其局限性，有时甚至是片面性；我们希望广大的读者，对报纸刊登的每条新闻经常加以注意，并随时提出批评与建议，真正形成群众性的检查报纸。这样才能使报纸更好的为人民服务。

    对南里信的工作有两点意见和疑问编辑同志：
    三月十九号报纸“襄垣南里信工作组检查旧作风”消息，看后有这两个感觉，只是我自己的认识，不一定对，提出请你们研究。
    一、那个村据报上情况看：地富斗垮，贫雇翻了身，只有两户没翻透（因去秋才回村），在组织贫农组时，查出十七个贫雇，这给上边说的是否有些出入呢？如都翻透了身，该村在土改中，可说是进行最好的村庄，我想有必要将那个村的阶级变化，贫雇翻透身的情形（土地、产粮、牲口、房屋、生活），以及群众现在的反映和要求写出来，因有些同志对贫雇怎算彻底翻身，还有点马虎，不甚了解。再者报纸上对这样材料，各地交流的也不多，如能写出每个贫雇翻身的尺度，叫各地作参考，也是很好的。
    二、“干部一律停职反省，群众起来给干部提意见，干部害怕，咱们又叫贫雇组长给干部道歉赔不是”。从这些事来看，这里主要的错误思想是不相信群众，不是根据群众要求来进行这个工作，而是自己的脑子想一套办一套。给干部赔不是，我想这是严重的错误，是违犯群众的民主权利的。南里信工作组同志也检讨出在工作中包办代替的缺点，我认为检讨还不够深刻，认识错误还不够透彻，未把这段工作中错误思想暴露出来，工作检查，应从思想上加以清算，找到发生工作错误的根源，来认识改正它；否则，在今后工作中，还易重犯这种错误。
    另外我对报纸有这样要求，太行新华报纸，在每篇稿子后边差不多有编者的意见，把稿子的优缺点，须要继续研究的都指出来，我想这样对读者帮助很大。贵报也不断附加编者意见，希望以后在比较重要的稿子后边，简明扼要加上编者一点意见，对读者同志的学习进步是有很大帮助的。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（西征）西征同志：
    你们对南里信工作组提的意见，希望南里信工作组同志能研究答复。对本报的意见很好，今后我们当在这方面多加努力。

    不要在道会门的入农会　这条件没有阶级性编辑同志：
    读了贵报上月二十日第一版所载襄垣大池成立新农会消息，谈到入农会条件时，说的四要三不要中的第二条不要道会门，经我们这个工作组同志们研究之后，认为这样提法没有阶级性，理由是：因为道会门仅是一种宗教迷信组织，而他里面参加的成员、成份是不同的，有地主、有富农、有中农、有贫雇各种成份。我们认为除地富外，是应该让他们参加农会的。这里主要是加强其阶级教育，启发他的阶级自觉性，不过这里不包括有政治背景反对平分的人及反对我党政策的人，应该是看个人的情况具体确定其参加与否，不应一概而论。这个意见是否正确请贵报解答。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（牛登达等）登达同志：
    关于大池村规定的入农会条件之一，不要道会门，你们的意见是正确的，那样提法确是没有阶级性的。在编辑的过程中，我们也感到有些条件有问题，但未细加分析批判，只在后边加了笼统的按语，说条件不要成为组织群众的限制，而未能提高到思想上予以明确的分析，是不够有力的。你们明确指出这一点，这对整个工作是有好处的。
    另外，希望大池工作组对此意见也能加以研究。
