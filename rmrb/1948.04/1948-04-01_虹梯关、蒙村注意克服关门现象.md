　　Hongti Pass, Meng Village
  　Pay Attention to Overcoming Closed-Door Tendencies
    [Pingshun News] In Hongti Pass, seventeen farmers in the whole village (ten poor and hired peasants, seven middle peasants) married daughters of landlords and rich peasants. During this democratic party rectification and supplementary movement, people brought it up every time when developing poor peasant members, but it was never approved. The masses said, "Speaking of being oppressed and exploited, they are the worst, but we are afraid they will tip off their wives." Shi Xiaomao said, "I am also a poor and hired peasant, and they are also poor and hired people. Because they married a landlord's daughter, one leg is tied down, and they cannot participate in the poor peasant association." He went home and beat his wife in frustration and anger. Some even proposed divorce; others said, "Bad cadres and bad party members can still reflect and admit their mistakes, but we are poor and hired and no one cares about this, and we don't know who to turn to." After research by the leadership and the poor peasant association, a meeting was held for farmers who married daughters of landlords and rich peasants. For example, the poor and hired Yue Hengyang said, "I have been a farmhand (lived as a long-term worker) for half my life, and I married a landlord's wife, and I can't participate in the poor peasant association." The poor peasant association group also discussed whether to absorb them or not. The result of the debate was that absorbing them is beneficial to us. He is a person of our class, as long as he can guarantee not to tell his wife about our affairs, he can be absorbed after being introduced by two people. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 18th of this month, they made self-criticisms to the poor peasant association, showed great concern for their poor brothers, and immediately approved Shi Xiaomao and other seven people to join the poor peasant association. Three cadres are still reviewing, and the remaining middle peasants are also being absorbed and united. They reflected: This is reassuring, and the poor brothers are back on the same line.

    [Wuyi News] When the working group arrived in Meng Village, they learned about the situation and held a cadre meeting to announce the dissolution of the old organization. Then, they held a mass meeting in the village to publicize the Outline Land Law. Afterwards, they started discovering poor and hired peasants from all aspects. When there were more than 20 people, they automatically gathered every night to discuss who else to absorb. Their condition was based on the distance to the cadres, and even the minor cadres' family members were not wanted. Most of those who spoke were those who had major disagreements with the cadres or had been fined. For example, the poorest, Sanhui, wanted to participate, and someone even asked him to find a guarantor. Because the conditions were too strict, many poor people could not be organized, and there were always only twenty-odd people. At this time, we went to the homes of poor peasants who could not join the association to understand the situation. Sanhui said, "I'm joining for the first time, and they want me to find a guarantor. I'm just poor and haven't made any mistakes." We also learned about the situation of the village head. He had only been in office for half a year and hadn't experienced anything yet. He was also the poorest and most honest farmer, and he couldn't participate either. This closed-door phenomenon is being educated and corrected. (Jian Dan)

　　虹梯关、蒙村
  　注意克服关门现象
    【平顺消息】虹梯关全村有十七个农民与地主富农女儿结婚（十个贫雇、七个中农），在这次民主整党抽补运动中，于发展贫农团员时，每次都有人提出，但每次都批不准。群众说：“说起受压迫受剥削数他们利害，就是怕给他老婆通风报信。”石小毛说：“咱也是贫雇，人家也是贫雇人，因为娶了个地主媳妇，圈住一条腿，就不能参加贫农团。”他苦闷生气的回家打起女人啦。甚至有的提出离婚；也有的说：“人家坏干部坏党员还能反省认错，咱是贫雇因为个这也没人理，也不知道去找谁。”领导上和贫农团研究后，召开娶地主富农女儿的农民开会。如贫雇岳恒羊说：“咱给人受了半辈（住长工），娶了个地主媳妇，贫农团也不能参加。”贫农团小组又讨论了吸收他们不吸收，争论结果认为吸收对咱有利，他是咱同阶级的人，只要能保证不和老婆说咱的事情，经过两人介绍，可以吸收他。所以在本月十八日下午，他们到贫农团作了自我批评，对自己的穷兄弟表现高度关心，当场批准了石小毛等七人参加贫农团，三个干部还在检讨，其余中农也在吸收联合中。他们反映：这可放了心，穷弟兄又站在一条路线上了。

    【武邑消息】工作组到了蒙村，了解了一下情况，就召开了干部会，宣布解散老组织，接着召开了村中群众大会，宣讲了土地法大纲，以后就从各方面去发现贫雇，约二十多个人时，他们每天晚上自动的集合讨论再吸收那些人，他们定条件是看给干部远近，连小干部当家子都不要。发言的多是和干部意见大的、被扣过的。如最穷的三会要参加，有人还提出要他找保。因条件太严，很多穷人就不能组织进去，老是二十几个人。这时我们便到不能入会的贫农家了解情况，三会说：“俺头一次入会，让俺找保，俺就是穷又没犯过错误。”又了解到村长的情况，他才当了半年，还没经过什么事情，也是最穷的老实农民，也不能参加。对这种关门现象，正教育改正中。（剑胆）
