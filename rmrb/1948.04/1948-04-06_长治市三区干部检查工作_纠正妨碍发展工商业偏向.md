　　[News from our newspaper] Cadres in Changzhi City's Third District, after studying the Land Law Outline and Chairman Mao's report on developing industry and commerce, have reviewed their past actions and realized that there were many adverse tendencies that violated policy and hindered the development of private capital. They are now working hard to conduct propaganda and explanations among the masses, correct past deviations, and support the development of private capital, moving towards the general goal of "developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." According to the review, the reason why various deviations occurred in the past was the result of impure thinking. For example, when they saw someone's business was good, they became jealous and emphasized cooperative management, causing many industrial and commercial enterprises to be afraid to develop freely. A cadre from Shangdong Street said: Xie Changyi in my street used to run a paint shop, which looked quite promising, but now he only has a small stall with over twenty thousand yuan of capital. Li Erzi's carpentry shop used to be one of the best, but a few days ago, he asked for a low-interest loan, only selling goods and not buying raw materials. They all have the economic conditions to develop, but they dare not. Why don't they dare to develop? A cadre from Xiadong Street learned a lesson from his own experience, saying: Zhou Bucheng in his street opened a flour mill last year with five other people, which was very profitable. Later, they heard that a house was for sale in the street, so they bought the house, preparing to expand the business, but the street cadres, with a combination of "mobilization" and intimidation, turned that privately operated flour mill into a joint venture for the whole street. Due to the above reasons, some people with slightly more developed capital did not consider how to expand reproduction, but tried to find various negative ways to control it. For example, Wu Dashun, a shopkeeper, bought an old ox with part of his earnings. He had no time to tend to it, so it not only did not benefit his business, but he also had to constantly spend money on fodder. Another example is Wu Liuhaizi's store, whose capital had just grown to 300,000 yuan. Instead of buying more goods, he took out 100,000 to 200,000 yuan to repair the house. From the review of concrete examples, cadres deeply realized that the failure to act in accordance with policy in the past created many obstacles on the road to developing industry and commerce and prospering the economy. Now, to remove these obstacles, they must openly admit their mistakes to the masses and deeply publicize the policies of the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao on protecting, supporting, and developing industry and commerce. The specific content of the publicity includes three points: (1) Conscientiously publicize Article 12 of the Land Law Outline of China and the sixth paragraph of Chairman Mao's report "The Current Situation and Our Tasks." (2) Explain that the Central Bureau and the Border Region Government decided to close the factories and shops run by the organs precisely to develop private capitalism. (3) Boldly and openly criticize their past erroneous views on the development of private capital in front of the masses, and, based on the current economic conditions, develop independently operated factories and shops under the general policy of "developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" as instructed by Chairman Mao. For mass cooperation, the principle of voluntariness must be emphasized, and absolutely no forced mergers should exist. In order to make this publicity and explanation penetrate every member of the masses, it was decided to combine internal and external party propaganda, large-scale propaganda with small-scale discussions, individual brewing with collective discussions, and carry it out in coordination.

　　长治市三区干部检查工作
  　纠正妨碍发展工商业偏向
    【本报消息】长治市三区干部学习了土地法大纲及毛主席报告发展工商业部分，检讨过去有许多违反政策、妨碍发展私人资本的恶劣倾向。现正努力在群众中进行宣传解释，纠正过去偏向，扶助私人资本发展，向“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的总目标迈进。根据检讨过去所以发生种种偏向，是由于自己思想不纯的结果。如看到谁生意好，就眼红，强调合作经营，致使许多工商业不敢放手发展。上东街干部说：我街谢常义，过去开颜料庄，很象个样，现在只摆两万多块钱的一个小摊摊。李二子的木匠铺，过去也是有数的几家里的一家，前几天却要求低利借款，光见往出卖货，不见往里买原料。他们都有经济条件，就是不敢发展。为什么不敢发展呢？下东街干部从自己切身体验中得出教训说：他街有个周补成，去年与另五个人合伙开了个粉坊，很赚钱，后来听说街上有座房子出卖，他们便把房子买下了，正准备把买卖往大处发展，却被街干部连“动员”带吓唬，把那座私人经营的粉坊转成全街合股的生意了。由于以上种种原因，致使有些资金稍有发展的人，不是考虑如何扩大再生产，而是想出种种消极办法加以节制。如武大顺是个坐商，却把赚来的一部分钱买了一条老牛，自己又没功夫赶，因此不仅不能对生意有所补益，还得经常贴草料。再如武六孩商店的资金刚发展到三十万元，不多置货物，却拿出一、廿万块钱修房屋。从具体例子的检讨中，使干部深刻认识到，由于过去不按政策办事，造成发展工商业繁荣经济道路上的许许多多障碍。现在要破除这些障碍，必须公开在群众中承认自己的错误，深入宣传中共中央及毛主席保护、扶植、发展工商业的政策。具体宣传内容有三：（一）认真宣传中国土地法大纲第十二条，毛主席“目前形势和我们的任务”报告第六段。（二）说明中央局、边府之所以决定机关生产所开办的工厂商店结束，正是为了发展私人资本主义。（三）大胆的公开的在群众面前批评自己过去在发展私人资本上的错误观点，并根据现在的经济条件，在毛主席指示“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的总方针下，发展独立经营的工厂商店。对于群众性合作，必须强调自愿原则，绝不容强迫合并的现象存在，为了使这次宣传解释深入到每个群众中去，决定采取党内与党外，大会宣传与小会座谈，个别酝酿与集体讨论结合的办法，配合进行。
