Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. According to the *Ping Bao* on the 9th and 10th of last month, the Mentougou coal miners live a hard life under the layers of exploitation by the Chiang Kai-shek's four big families: The mining area has more than 16,000 workers, divided into in-mine workers, piece-rate workers, loading and unloading workers, and odd-job workers, of which piece-rate workers account for more than 3,000. Of the meager wages that each person should receive every day, the blood-sucking pawns "foremen" fostered by the Chiang Kai-shek mining company get to deduct 10,000 yuan, and the actual income of the workers is only 70,000 yuan. However, local corn flour sells for 19,000 yuan per catty, and each worker has to eat two catties and ten taels a day; plus, buying several thousand yuan worth of pickles to eat leaves them with almost nothing left of their daily income, making it impossible to buy a pair of shoes or a jacket, let alone support their families. Some workers angrily cursed the Chiang Kai-shek gang and their blood-sucking pawns, saying: "Our boss, if we are sick and take a day off, we can't even borrow 1,000 yuan; but the boss brings an opera singer to sleep for one night and it costs 1 million or 2 million, and he buys meat for his wife and buys a dozen pairs of red socks at a time." The wages of loading and unloading workers are sometimes only 15,000 yuan a day, and at most no more than 100,000 yuan. When wages are low, the workers tighten their belts and lie on the earthen kang to sleep. A worker who can carry three or four hundred catties of coal complained: "This is hard work that requires chiseling and hacking, and if you don't get enough to eat, your arms and legs will be sore and weak. During the New Year, we only got to eat one catty of meat and two catties of noodles, and from New Year's to now we have been gnawing on cornbread and drinking corn porridge." The wages of small kiln workers are only 20,000 yuan for every 50 catties of coal they carry, and each person can only carry a maximum of 200 catties per day, while the kiln owner uses a large scale of 20 taels per catty to weigh the coal that is carried out of the pit step by step with sweat. They are all forced by the Chiang Kai-shek gang to live a hellish life.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. *Jin Bao* reports: People in the Chiang-controlled areas of eastern Hebei cannot bear the harshness and tyranny and are fleeing in all directions. Only dozens of households are left in Xianghe city, and young and middle-aged people are even scarcer; the city's commerce now only has a small shop and a few cigarette and peanut stalls left. People in the areas of Ninghe County occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops have mostly abandoned their homes and fled far away. In the first and second districts alone, there are 200,000 mu of fertile land that has been abandoned due to lack of cultivation. Most of the county has been liberated, and the areas still occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops account for only three-tenths, yet they must bear more than 153,000 catties of military grain every month. Among the heavy and miscellaneous taxes in Xianghe, the "self-defense force" food alone requires 2,000 catties of millet per day. A few months ago, dozens of Chiang Kai-shek's military officers were killed in battle with the People's Liberation Army, and the Chiang Kai-shek troops took the opportunity to extort 1 billion yuan in burial expenses in the county to line their own pockets.

Furthermore: In Luan County on the Beining Railway, due to the Chiang Kai-shek's requisition of grain, loans, and various harsh and miscellaneous taxes, the people's grain has been depleted by sixty to seventy percent. On the 21st of last month, grain prices soared, with millet reaching 550,000 yuan per dou (about 18 market catties) and wheat reaching 580,000 yuan.

　　门头沟工人生活苦啃窝窝头也吃不饱
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据平报上月九、十两日披露门头沟煤矿工人在蒋匪四大家族层层剥削下之困苦生活称：矿区一万六千余工人，分里工、件工、装卸工、活工四种，其中件工约三千余人。在每人每日应得之低微工资中，蒋匪矿方豢养之吸血爪牙“包工头”得克扣一万元，工人实际所得仅有七万元。但当地棒子面每斤已售至一万九千元，每个工人一天要吃二斤十两；再加上买几千块钱的咸菜吃，一天所得便所剩无几，要买双鞋、买件褂子也不可能，更谈不到养活家眷。有的工人愤怒的骂着蒋匪帮及其吸血爪牙说：“我们掌柜的，我们有了病歇一天工，借一千块钱都借不出来；可是掌柜的拉个唱戏的来睡一宿就是一百万、二百万，给他老婆买肉，买红色的袜子一买就是一打。”装卸工人的工资有时一天只能得到一万五千块钱，最多时也不过十万块。工资少的时候，工人们便紧勒着肚子躺在土炕上睡大觉。一个能扛三、四百斤煤的工人诉苦说：“这是生凿硬砍的活儿，吃不饱就胳膊酸腿软。过年的时候，只吃到一斤肉、两斤面，从过年到现在一直是啃窝窝头喝棒渣粥。”小窑工人工资每背五十斤煤仅得两万元，每人每天最多只能背二百斤，而窑主计工时，却用二十两一斤的大秤称那用一步一点汗背出坑口的煤。他们都被蒋匪帮驱迫着过着地狱般的生活。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】津报讯：冀东蒋区人民不堪苛暴，四散逃生。香河城内只剩数十户，青壮年更为稀少；全城商业现仅残存一个小商店和几个纸烟花生摊。宁河县蒋匪盘踞区域人民多弃家远逃。仅第一、二两区即有良田二十万亩，因无人耕种而荒芜。该县大部地区业已解放，蒋匪困守地区只有十分之三，每月负担军粮即达十五万三千余斤。香河的繁重苛杂中，只“自卫队”食粮一项，每天即需小米二千斤。月前有蒋匪军官数十名在与解放军作战中毙命，蒋匪即乘机在该县勒索埋葬费十亿元中饱私囊。
    又讯：北宁路上的滦县，由于蒋匪征实、征借及种种苛杂的榨取，民间粮食耗去十分之六七，上月二十一日粮价猛涨，小米每斗（约十八市斤）达蒋币五十五万元，小麦五十八万元。
