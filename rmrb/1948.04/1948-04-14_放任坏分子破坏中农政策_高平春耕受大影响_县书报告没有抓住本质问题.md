　　Allowing Bad Elements to Sabotage the Middle Peasant Policy
  　Spring Plowing in Gaoping Severely Affected
  　County Secretary's Report Fails to Grasp the Essence of the Problem
    [Our News] The Gaoping County Mass Daily reported on the 5th of this month that the Gaoping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of 800 village cadres on the 1st to remove ideological obstacles and mobilize spring plowing. The correspondent of the General Branch believes that the county committee's mobilization still only sees the phenomena and fails to grasp the essence, adopting a piecemeal approach of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. The county committee must conduct a profound examination of its leadership's ideology, find the source of the problem, and seek a fundamental solution to solve the problem. The reporter believes that the basic reasons why Gaoping "has become chaotic everywhere" and "spring plowing has not yet become a movement," as revealed in the Mass Daily's news, lie in the leadership's lack of steadfastness and clarity regarding the middle peasant policy, which was the case in the past and still is the case now—even at this village cadre meeting. This is reflected in the following three issues: First, Comrade Li, the county secretary, pointed out: "Due to the many concerns in the cadres' minds, the greatest difficulty has been created for spring plowing work." Cadres feel that being a cadre "has no future." "Since the organization of poor peasant and hired laborer groups in winter production, three erroneous phenomena have been discovered: 1. Cadres deliberately incite the poor peasant and hired laborer groups to act blindly and infringe upon the interests of middle peasants. 2. They lie down and sulk, doing nothing. 3. They look down on the poor and hired laborers, believing that the poor and hired laborers cannot do without the cadres. For example, in Li Village in the Fifth District, there are 30 households (all middle and well-to-do middle peasants), divided into ten poor peasant/hired laborer households, ten middle peasant households, and ten targets of struggle, allowing the targets of struggle to 'move' the poor and hired laborers. In River Village in the Second District, the door of Sun Qifang, a middle peasant blacksmith, was sealed, saying that he does not serve the poor and hired laborers, does not follow the poor and hired laborer line, and is not allowed to leave the village for production, etc... Chaos has been created everywhere, causing everyone to feel insecure (?)... Because of many such facts, the masses' enthusiasm for production cannot be stabilized." Second, Comrade Li believes that cadres have misinterpreted the Land Law Outline, and in the past, "in the review of class status, they turned the target to the middle peasants, struggling against most of the middle peasants. In the recent struggle in Yang Village, a middle peasant was beaten to death, which is a fact and should not have happened." What do the above facts show? It shows that in the past "class status" struggles (not just once), middle peasants were struggled against, and "most" (not just individual cases!) of them were struggled against (is there a need to check whether there were poor and hired laborers among the middle peasants who were struggled against?), and that "recently" (not just in the past) a middle peasant was "beaten to death" (not just struggled against)! That is to say, in the past and now, the interests of middle peasants have been and are being severely infringed upon, and the middle peasant policy has been and is being violated. With this, the middle peasants are uneasy, and the poor peasants will also develop the fear of rising up. It is not accidental that spring plowing cannot form a movement. The county committee believes that since the spring plowing mobilization meeting on March 7th, "cadres and the masses in most villages have been greatly mobilized for spring plowing," "but there are still some villages where spring plowing has not yet become a movement." This estimate may not be consistent with the facts. On the one hand, there has been no actual change in the middle peasant policy; on the contrary, people have recently been beaten to death! Furthermore, the facts of production control and movement control still exist. The masses' enthusiasm for production is not high, mainly because the violation of middle peasant interests is too serious. It is impossible to solve the problem by merely focusing on the cadres' thinking (of course, educating the cadres is absolutely necessary). Third, based on the above situation, when the county committee arranges future work, the most important, resolute, and unwavering task should be to correct the phenomenon of violating the interests of middle peasants and wage a sharp and irreconcilable struggle against this tendency. In that case, regarding the Yang Village incident where a middle peasant was beaten to death, County Secretary Li should not have treated it as a normal incident, casually saying, "It is a fact, and it should not have happened." Instead, he should have severely criticized the matter in principle at the village cadre meeting, and the leadership should have conducted a self-criticism of the middle peasant policy, pointed out the direction, made decisions, and educated the leadership, cadres, and masses. Secondly, in future work, mastering the middle peasant policy should not be placed on the same level as some specific measures—such as "not allowing the control of mass production, not allowing the control of women, the control of workers leaving the village, not allowing the random pursuit of mass thinking, and the random labeling of people as special agents," etc. (this is absolutely necessary)—without raising the correction of deviations in the middle peasant policy to the height it deserves. The result will inevitably be a focus on phenomena, forgetting the essence, treating the head when it hurts, and treating the foot when it hurts, without solving the fundamental problem. By resolutely and prudently resolving the middle peasant issue, removing the cadres' ideological obstacles, and pointing out the way out, and by focusing on solving the issue of middle peasant interests while removing the cadres' ideological obstacles, the leadership will not be in a passive position, production enthusiasm will gradually increase, and spring plowing can form a movement.

### 放任坏分子破坏中农政策　高平春耕受大影响　县书报告没有抓住本质问题

　　放任坏分子破坏中农政策
  　高平春耕受大影响
  　县书报告没有抓住本质问题
    【本报消息】本月五日高平县大众报载该县中共县委会于一日召开八百村干部开会，扫除思想障碍动员春耕。总分社记者认为该县委的动员仍是看到现象，没有抓住本质，头痛医头，脚痛医脚的治标办法；该县委会尚须从领导思想上做深刻的检查，找出病源，求得治本的办法来，才能解决问题。记者认为从大众报的消息里面透露出来，高平的“各地都搞成了混乱现象”，“春耕仍未成为运动”的基本原因，在于领导上对于中农政策的不坚定不明确，过去如此，现在——直到这次村干大会上仍然如此。表现在以下三个问题上：第一、县书李同志首先指出：“由于干部思想存在许多顾虑，造成春耕工作的最大困难”。干部感到当干部“没下场”。“自去冬生产组织贫雇小组以后，就发现了三种错误现象：一、干部故意挑动贫雇组盲干，侵犯中农利益。二、躺倒呕气，啥也不干。三、看不起贫雇，认为贫雇离不开干部。如五区李家有三十户人家（全是中农富裕中农），划成十家贫雇，十家中农，十家斗争对象，让斗争对象给贫雇动弹。二区河村封闭了中农铁匠孙起方的门，说他不给贫雇服务，不走贫雇路线，不让出村生产等……。各地都搞成了混乱现象，造成人人自危（？）……因为许多这样的事实，使得群众生产情绪不能安定”。第二、李同志认为干部曲解土地法大纲，过去“在层次复查中，反将目标转向中农，把大部分中农斗了。杨村最近斗争，打死一个中农，就是事实，这是不应该的”。以上事实说明什么呢？说明过去“层次”（不是一次）斗中农，斗了“大部分”（不是个别的！）（斗争的中农中是否有贫雇？还值得检查），说明“最近”（不只是过去）“打死”（不只是斗争）了一个中农！就是说过去与现在都严重的侵犯了与侵犯着中农的利益，违犯了与违犯着中农政策，这样中农不安，贫农也要产生怕上升的思想，春耕形不成运动，不是偶然的。县委会认为自三月七日春耕动员大会后，“大部村庄干部和群众春耕已经大动开了”，“但还有部分村庄，春耕仍未成为运动”。这个估计恐不符合事实，一则中农政策没有实际的转变，相反的最近还打死人！再则管制生产、管制行动的事实还存在着。群众生产情绪不高，基本上在于违犯中农利益太严重，光在干部思想上打圈子是解决不了问题的（当然教育干部是万分必要的）。第三、根据上述情况，县委会布置今后工作时，首应明确的、坚决的、毫不动摇的作为中心任务的去纠正违犯中农利益的现象，与这种倾向作尖锐的不调和的斗争。那末关于杨村打死中农事件，县书李同志就不应该如同一个平常事件一样，轻描淡写的说：“就是事实，这是不应该的”，而应在村干部大会上，从原则上严厉的批评那件事情，领导上并作中农政策的自我检讨，指出方针，作出决定，教育领导，教育干部，教育群众。其次在今后工作方面，不应该把掌握中农政策与一些具体的办法平列起来——如与“不准管制群众生产，不准管制妇女、管制工人出村，不准乱追群众思想、乱戴特务帽子”等等（这是完全必要的）平列起来，没有把纠正中农政策上的偏向提到应有的高度，结果必然形成抓现象，忘本质，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，解决不了基本问题。在坚决而慎重的解决中农问题当中，扫除干部的思想障碍，指出出路，在扫除干部的思想障碍中，抓紧解决中农利益的问题，不至使领导上陷于被动，生产情绪将逐渐转高，春耕才能形成运动。
