　　Yan'an Has Been Recaptured!
    On the morning of April 21st, our People's Liberation Army recaptured Yan'an, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops fled in panic with their tails between their legs. Since our army's voluntary withdrawal from Yan'an on March 19th of last year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have entered the dragnet we had laid out for them. They were trapped in the isolated city of Yan'an, unable to advance or retreat, trembling with fear, and suffering from hunger and cold. A soldier could sometimes only get nine taels of rice a day. Our army, on the other hand, was very active, winning battles everywhere. In the past year, we eliminated more than 52 regiments, or about 100,000 men, on the Northwest battlefield. Since the great victory of Yichuan in early March of this year, our army has been attacking step by step, with the force of a thunderbolt; the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops have been losing soldiers and generals, and being beaten everywhere. Recently, our army advanced into the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway and recaptured counties such as Qianxian and Yongshou, putting the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on the defensive from all sides, facing total collapse, and they had no choice but to flee with their tails between their legs. Yan'an has now returned to the hands of our people. The recapture of Yan'an shows that the day of Chiang Kai-shek's downfall is not far off! All our people in the district must step up production! Celebrate the liberation of Yan'an and strive for the early arrival of a great victory!

　　延安收复了！
    四月二十一号清早，我们解放军收复了延安，蒋胡匪军夹着尾巴慌忙逃窜了。去年三月十九号我军主动撤离延安以来，蒋胡匪钻进了我们布置好的天罗地网。他们困在延安孤城，进不得，退不得，心惊胆战，挨饿受冻，一个兵有时一天只能吃到九两米。我军在那里，却是很活动的到处打胜仗，一年来西北战场上一共消灭他五十二个多团，约合十万人。今年三月初，我军在宜川大捷以后，即步步进攻，势如破竹；蒋胡匪军损兵折将，到处挨打，最近我军挺进西兰公路收复＠县、永寿等城，弄得蒋胡匪四面受敌，面临全面溃灭，只好夹起尾巴逃走了。延安从此又回到了咱们人民的手中。延安的收复，说明蒋匪介石倒台的日子确是不远了！咱们全区老百姓要加油生产！庆贺延安的解放，争取大胜利早些到来！
