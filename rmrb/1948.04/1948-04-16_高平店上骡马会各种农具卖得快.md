　　Gaoping Dianshang Mule and Horse Fair
  　Various Farm Tools Sell Quickly
    [Taiyue News] The mule, horse and farm implement fair in Dianshang Village, Gaoping, still started on the 19th day of the second lunar month (March 29th) and lasted for three days. On the 19th, people from the surrounding twenty or thirty *li* came to the fair to buy farm tools and livestock. The open space of more than ten *mu* south of the village was filled with plows, seeders, harrows, drags, baskets, cart baskets, hoe handles, hoe heads, and other farm tools. Donkeys, mules, horses, and cattle were tied everywhere. The reporter interviewed a hoe seller who said, "Manure buckets are selling really fast today. One place here had more than forty loads, and they've already sold out." We asked him, "How about hoe handles?" He said, "Not as fast as hoe heads." But he didn't have many hoe handles left either. A seller of manure buckets from Fushan Village said, "We've sold more than ten of our twenty-odd loads of manure buckets." Qin Fashun, a veteran from Xianjing, had a basket stall and was busy sweating profusely. Many people were still waiting in front of the stall to buy. We said, "Your baskets are selling really fast!" He said happily, "My village brought more than four hundred loads today and has already sold three hundred loads. Only a hundred or so loads are left, and there are still two days of the fair, so I'm not worried about selling them." The 19th was only the beginning of the big fair, and the farm tools were already selling so quickly, which shows the local masses' enthusiasm for actively preparing for spring plowing.

　　高平店上骡马会
  　各种农具卖得快
    【太岳消息】高平店上村的骡马农具会仍在旧历二月十九日（三月二十九）起会，会期三天，在十九日这天，周围二、三十里的人来赶会购买农具，买卖牲口，村南边十几亩大的一块场地上，摆满了犁、耧、耙、耢、箩头、车不篮、＠柄、锄柄等农具，又到处拴着驴、骡、马、牛，记者访问了一个卖锄的人，他说：“今天卖粪桶真快，这一片地方有一家摆了四十余担已经卖完了。”又问他“锄柄快不快？”他说：“不象＠柄快。”但他的锄柄也不剩几根了。釜山村卖粪桶的说：“我们的二十几担粪桶也卖十几担了。”仙井的退伍军人秦发顺摆着箩头摊，一直忙的满头大汗。不少人还在摊前等着买，我们说：“你的箩头真卖的快呀！”他很高兴的说：“我村今天担来四百多担，已经卖了三百担，剩下百把担，还有两天会哩，这还愁卖。”十九日仅是大会的开头，农具就卖的这么快，这说明当地群众积极准备春耕的情绪。
