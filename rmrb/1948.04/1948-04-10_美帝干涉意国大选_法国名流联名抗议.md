　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Paris dispatch: Many French celebrities recently jointly published a declaration protesting the ugly behavior of foreign countries (mainly the United States) interfering in the Italian elections. The declaration stated: Foreign governments and reactionary leaders, in violation of basic international norms, are trying to influence the will of the Italian people. These attempts at interference and intimidation run counter to the ideal of cooperation between countries. As the Italian people prepare to elect, the French people express their sympathy to the Italian people. The people of Italy and France, in order to seek a path leading to peace and true democracy, do not need any external advice or threats. The declaration was signed by Baye, Chairman of the French Federation of Journalists, Dibosai, Vice-Chairman of the French Federal Assembly, parliamentarians Wei Jili and Gu Te, and Paris City Councilor Jiniba, among others.

　　美帝干涉意国大选
  　法国名流联名抗议
    【新华社陕北八日电】巴黎讯：法国社会名流多人，日前联名发表宣言，抗议外国（主要是美国）干涉意大利选举的丑行。宣言说：外国政府和反动领袖，违反基本的国际惯例，力图影响意国人民的意志。这些干涉与恫吓的企图，显于各国合作的理想背道而驰。当意国人民正准备选举的时候，法国人民特对意国人民表示同情。意法两国人民为了寻求引向和平与真正民主的道路，不需要任何外来的忠告或威胁。签署于此一宣言的，有全法报界联合会主席贝叶，法联邦议会副主席狄波赛，议员魏基利和谷特，巴黎市议员吉尼柏等。
