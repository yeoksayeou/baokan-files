　　He Who Plants Should Reap
    Comrade Wang Ximeng, Third District, Xiuwu:
    Your two points of view on the Border Region Government's policy of "He who plants should reap" are answered separately as follows:
    1. You propose that in past movements, cadres and activists occupied much good land and land close to their homes. After the redistribution, if they are allowed to harvest what they planted, the poor and hired peasants will be dissatisfied. If they are not allowed to harvest, they will not be willing to manage the land well before the redistribution. What should be done? This issue should be affirmed. As long as they planted it, they should be allowed to harvest it, because it is the result of their labor (they invested labor and capital). It cannot be treated the same as the excess land they occupied and must return (excess land must be resolutely returned). The poor and hired peasants' dissatisfaction should be addressed through persuasion.
    2. For landlords and rich peasants who have not been thoroughly struggled against, should they be allowed to harvest the crops when their land is confiscated or requisitioned? This issue should also be handled according to Article 2 of the Border Region Government's proclamation: For land whose allocation and adjustment were determined before this year's Qingming Festival, if the original cultivator has already planted seeds (wheat or autumn crops) before the allocation was determined, although the land ownership has changed, the summer or autumn harvest of that land is guaranteed to belong to the original cultivator (including landlords and rich peasants), and shall not be divided equally. Therefore, as long as they labored and planted it, it should be their harvest. In short, the policy of "he who plants should reap" in the Border Region Government's proclamation must be resolutely implemented, and no one-sided opinions can be accommodated; otherwise, it will inevitably affect the spring plowing.

　　谁种应该谁收修武三区王希孟同志：
    你对于边府谁种谁收的两点意见分别答复如下：
    一、你提出过去运动中干部积极分子多占好地近地很多，抽补后，如果他们种下的还让他们收，贫雇不满意，如不让他们收，则未在抽补前他们就不肯好好经营，该怎么办？这一问题应该肯定，只要是他们种下就应该归他们收，因为这是他们劳动所得（他们下了劳力和资本），不能和多占的土地一样退出（多得的土地应坚决退出）。贫雇不满意应该说服。
    二、未斗透的地主、富农，在没收或征收他们的土地时，庄稼是否还让他们收获？这个问题也应该按照边府布告第二条的规定：凡在今年清明节前，分配调剂确定的土地，其在分配确定之前，已由原耕种人下种者（麦地或秋地）则土地所有权虽有变更，但该土地夏季或秋季的生产物，保证仍各归原耕种人（包括地主富农在内）所有，不得平分。故只要是他们劳动种下的，应该归他们收获。总之，对于边府布告中的谁种谁收，应该坚决执行，不能迁就任何片面意见，否则，势必影响春耕。
