Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—According to foreign press reports: Ten universities in Beijing and Tianjin held a one-day general strike on the 21st to protest the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit secret agents in beating and arresting Chengdu students. It is reported that when more than a thousand students from Sichuan University, West China University, and Chenghua University in Chengdu held an anti-hunger parade and demonstration on the 9th of this month, 30 students were arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, many were injured, and one female student was beaten to death.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—According to Tianjin newspaper reports: "National" Tangshan Institute of Technology also participated in the anti-oppression student movement in Beijing and Tianjin, holding a three-day strike from the 9th of this month to protest the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's order to disband the North China Student Federation. After the strike began, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in military uniform suddenly drove into the school in two trucks to "inspect," making empty threats and clamoring noisily for twenty minutes. Tangshan Institute of Technology students expressed extreme indignation at this and have requested the school to lodge a serious protest with Chiang Kai-shek's military authorities and demand guarantees for student safety, while also deciding to extend the strike by one day to express their protest. Every night, more than 30 students take turns keeping watch to strictly prevent secret agent activities. After the incident on the 11th when Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents smashed Peking University dormitories and arrested students, the students of Tangshan Institute of Technology held a general assembly again on the 12th, resolving to continue the strike from the 13th, taking consistent action with students from various schools in Beijing and Tianjin, and deciding to cut their food intake by one day on the 13th, saving the money to aid injured students at Peking University. More than a hundred workers at the school also held an anti-hunger strike starting on the 10th, demanding continued allocation of flour and distribution of goods, and increased wages. The workers also all participated in the Tangshan Institute of Technology students' denunciation meeting held on the 11th to defend the Student Federation and pour out their grievances. During the strike, student performed the duties of the workers. Furthermore, lecturers and teaching assistants at the school, in response to the strike of lecturers and teaching assistants at various colleges and universities in Beijing and Tianjin to strive for improved treatment, also began a three-day strike from the 10th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—According to delayed news from Tianjin: Nankai University in Tianjin has launched a heroic struggle against secret agent persecution. After female student Zhu Zhuying was seriously injured by secret agents on the 5th of this month, the Student Union convened an emergency meeting of representatives from various departments on the following morning to discuss ways to resist Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent persecution, with female student representatives also attending the meeting. During the meeting, more than 20 Chiang Kai-shek secret agent "students" from the school suddenly broke into the meeting place, disrupted the meeting and started fighting, and many people, including Zhang Qifang, a standing director of the Student Union, were injured. After these two secret agent atrocities occurred, all the students were filled with indignation, and in the afternoon of the 6th, representatives from various departments held another meeting, deciding to extend the strike by three days from the 7th, demanding that the school immediately expel the secret agent murderers and protesting to Chiang Kai-shek's Tianjin municipal authorities about the Zhu Zhuying being beaten by secret agents. However, when the Chiang Kai-shek party school authorities announced the handling results on the 9th, they only gave the perpetrators, who were secret agents, a major demerit and two minor demerits, while Zhang Qifang, the head of the Student Union who was beaten, was given two minor demerits. The representatives of various departments then decided again in the afternoon to extend the strike by three days from the 10th to express serious protest.
