    Chengci Resolutely Protects Industry and Commerce; Returns Commercial Property to Landlords
    [Chengci News] During the re-examination last year, the masses in Chengci town confiscated the industrial and commercial property—a paint shop—of Wang Fuchen, a landlord in the town, as a "traitor" business (actually not a traitor business). This included a large vat of indigo dye (one hundred and twenty catties), three hundred and twenty barrels of assorted paints for front doors, more than forty boxes of needles, four large boxes of Prussian blue, fifteen packages of thimbles, and other items such as towels, socks, soap, sweaters, etc., estimated to be worth more than 40 million yuan. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, in order to resolutely implement the policy on industry and commerce, the county specially assigned five or six cadres to focus on this work in the town. After several days of in-depth understanding, they learned that the business was indeed Wang Fuchen's private property and not a traitor's. After research, the working comrades decided to return these goods to the original owner intact, allowing him to operate freely. After the decision was made, a general meeting of all poor peasants in the town was convened, and the situation was explained to them, along with the importance of the policy on industry and commerce. The masses were then divided into groups for discussion. They all said, "If there are no businesses in our town, we will be trapped to death. After the return, we can buy whatever we want." They immediately passed a resolution that the confiscated goods of Wang Fuchen be returned intact. On the eighth day, a general meeting of all merchants in the town was convened. At this meeting, the Party's policy on industry and commerce was explained, stating that industry and commerce would be supported and protected in the future, and that the interests of industry and commerce must not be harmed in any way. It was also announced on the spot that the goods confiscated from Wang Fuchen in the town last year would be returned in full. The merchants were particularly enthusiastic. Wang ××, a merchant on the back street of the town, said, "From now on, we will dare to do business if we have capital! If it were like last year, we would have to close down. Now we can rest assured." After the meeting, the goods were returned to Wang Fuchen in full, and he has now started business with great enthusiasm. He said, "I will definitely work hard and not waste anything in the future, and I will continue to develop and expand." His shop assistant, Han ××, sprinkles water several times a day in front of the shop and sweeps it clean. There were also several cases of wrong accusations, and after understanding the situation, they were immediately returned to them.

    成磁坚决保护工商业
    退还地主商业财产
    【成磁消息】成磁城关群众，在去年复查时，把城里地主王富臣的工商业——颜料庄，按“汉奸”买卖没收了（实际不是汉奸买卖）。计有煮青一大桶（一百二十斤），前门杂色颜料三百二十桶，针四十多盒，幅利青四大盒，顶针十五包，其他毛巾、袜子、肥皂、毛衣等等，估计能值四千多万元。土地法大纲下来后，为了坚决执行工商业政策，县里特别抽出五六个干部，在城关专搞这一工作，经几天的深入了解，知道了这个买卖确是王富臣私人的，并不是汉奸的。经研究后，工作同志即确定这些货物原封不动，退回原主，让他自由经营。确定以后，随召开全城关贫农全体会，将了解的情况向他们说明，并又讲明对工商业的政策及工商业的重要，随叫群众分组讨论。都纷纷乱说：“咱城里没有买卖，就把咱困死了，退回去以后，咱买点啥可随便啦。”立即全体通过：没收王富臣的货物原封不动退回。初八日召开了全城关商人大会，在这个大会上讲明我党工商业政策，说明今后要扶助工商业，保护工商业，丝毫不能损害工商业的利益等等，并又当场宣布，去年没收城里王富臣的货物原数退回。商人劲头特别大，城里后街商人王××说：“这以后有本钱就敢干啦！还象去年一样，那只有关门不干，这就放心啦。”会后即将货物原数退给王富臣，现已开始营业，情绪非常高，他表示：今后一定好好干，不浪费，今后还要继续发展扩大。他的伙计韩××，在店门前一天洒好几遍水，扫的干干净净。还有几家斗错了的，等了解情况后，马上即退回他们。
