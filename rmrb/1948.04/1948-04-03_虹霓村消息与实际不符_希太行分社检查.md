　　Hongni Village News Does Not Match Reality
　　To the Xitaihang Branch Editorial Comrades:
　　After reading the news on the first page of your paper on the 24th about PingShun County having mostly finished delivering manure, I felt that one section did not match the facts. In the sixth district, there is a Hongni Village, not a Neon Village. This may be a typesetting error. However, it says that the Neon Village Chief and Political Director of the sixth district honestly reflected on their mistakes at the mobilization meeting for production and proposed to transform themselves by leading production. Now they are leading everyone in a heated tree planting campaign, having planted a total of more than 4,000 trees such as soft jujubes... Before planting trees, the village did not hold a mobilization meeting for production, and the village chief and political director did not reflect on their mistakes at any such meeting. They only reflected on them at the branch meeting after the democratic party rectification began. He is actively working to seek the masses' forgiveness, but he has not said these words. When the masses oppose empty and false reports, this kind of news that does not match the facts, when it spreads to other villages that do not understand, may be glossed over, but when it is published in this village, it will lower the credibility of the Party newspaper. I think this approach is wrong and should be noted. Please discuss whether this is correct. (Wang Changqun)

　　虹霓村消息与实际不符
  　希太行分社检查编辑同志：
    我看到贵报廿四日一版上登的平顺全县粪土大部送完的消息后，感到其中一段与事实不符，六区有个虹霓村并没有个霓虹村。这可能是排字排错了。但是说六区霓虹村村长和政治主任在动员生产会上，老老实实的把自己错误做了反省，并提出要在领导生产中来改造自己。现在正领导大家展开了热烈的植树运动，共计栽了软枣等树木四千余棵………。该村在栽树以前，并没有开过动员生产会，村长和政治主任也并无在这会上反省过，只是在民主整党开始后，在支部会上做过反省，只是他积极工作想求得群众宽容自己，但也并无说过这些话。当在群众反对客里空假报告时，这种与事实不符的消息，传到别村因不了解也许马虎过去，但发到本村就要降低党报的威信，我想这种做法不对，应该注意。是否正确，希展开讨论。（王长群）
