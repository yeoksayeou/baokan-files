Over 100 bandits, including the bandit battalion commander, were killed or wounded, and over 200 enemy soldiers, including the enemy deputy battalion commander, were captured alive. Twelve light and heavy machine guns and over 100 rifles were seized. In the afternoon of the same day, over 100 bandit cavalrymen who came out of Datong were repulsed, along with two tanks.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 23rd: After the annihilation of the Men Shuhuai unit of the Fu bandit's Independent First Column in Liangcheng, over 200 of its scattered remnant bandits recently gathered in Huanghe Shao Village, southeast of Gui Sui. On the 16th, our Sui Meng cavalry made a surprise attack on the enemy, killing over 40 bandits, including bandit regiment commander Wang Junfeng, capturing 58 alive, and seizing 59 rifles, one light machine gun, 74 warhorses, and a portion of other military supplies.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 23rd: A front-line reporter reports on the annihilation of the Jiang bandit's New 17th Brigade: On the afternoon of the 15th (previously mistakenly reported as the 16th), a unit of the Jianghan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army surrounded the 1st Regiment (missing the 2nd Battalion) of the Jiang bandit's New 17th Brigade in Sanyangdian. After two hours of fierce fighting, the entire enemy force was annihilated. Our army then took advantage of the victory and advanced directly towards the Jiang bandit stronghold of Songhe under the moonlight. On the afternoon of the 16th, our army launched a general offensive under the cover of powerful artillery fire. After eleven hours of fighting, by the morning of the 17th, the defending enemy, including the headquarters of the New 17th Brigade, the entire 2nd Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment, were annihilated. Thus, the New 17th Brigade, which the Jiang bandits used to harm the people of Jianghan, has been completely wiped out.
