Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd: Since the Spring Festival, schools in various parts of the Northeast Liberated Area have been enrolling students on a large scale. The Heilongjiang Provincial Government has decided to expand the provincial Jiamusi United Middle School by merging the Youth Cadre School and the Vocational Cadre School into it. In addition to middle school classes, it plans to add normal classes, worker-peasant classes, and vocational classes. At the same time, in order to meet the strong cultural demands of the vast number of young men and women in rural areas after their emancipation, it has been decided to add farmer classes to the middle schools in Jiamusi, Fujin, Yilan, and Boli. The study period is tentatively set at six months to one year, to train cadres such as clerks and assistants for farmers' associations and district governments. In order to solve the problem of primary school teachers, it has been decided to continue to run one-year normal classes in the middle schools of Jiamusi, Fujin, Yilan, Boli, Heli, Huanan, and Jixian. Generally, children of rich peasants and landlords, and those who have previously worked as primary school teachers and are now willing to serve the cause of New Democratic education, can enroll. Each middle school also provides free studentships or work-study programs to give the vast number of young people the opportunity to pursue further education. The counties in the province recently held symposiums to explain the decision of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC regarding intellectuals, eliminate their concerns, and encourage them to serve the cause of New Democratic education. It has been decided to provide appropriate care for primary school teachers in terms of their living and working conditions. Liaobei Province decided last month to establish three new middle schools in addition to the existing five provincial middle schools, concentrating efforts to run these eight middle schools well. At the same time, each middle school will also establish farmer classes, focusing on improving cultural levels, linking with practice, and paying attention to mass-based learning and mutual assistance, in order to improve to a certain cultural level in a short period of time. For general students, the focus is on ideological transformation, political education, and social activities, to cultivate their labor perspective and mass perspective, in order to transform their remaining blind orthodox concepts and exploiting class consciousness. Songjiang Province recently convened a joint conference of middle school principals from the province, deciding to massively train primary school teachers to develop national education. The Provincial Xingzhi Normal Schools No. 1 and No. 2 have already enrolled 800 students this semester. Harbin City recently decided to establish a workers' middle school to cultivate worker intellectuals. The study period is three years, and it will enroll 300 in-service industrial workers under the age of 30 with more than four consecutive years of work experience. Clothing, food, lodging, and stationery will all be provided by the school.
