　　Qinshui Dongjiashan Village
  　Formulates Production Plan
    [Taiyue News] After discovering that poor and middle peasants in Dongjiashan Village, Qinshui County, Hebei Province, had the idea of waiting for equal distribution, in-depth publicity and explanation were carried out. On the night of the eighteenth day of the first lunar month, a meeting was held to reorganize mutual aid teams to allow everyone to talk about their thoughts. Two old men, Tian Shiguang and Tian Shilong, middle peasants, said: "In the past, we only heard about equal distribution, and we didn't know exactly how to do it. We were thinking wildly all day long; since this is the case, what are we afraid of? Let's focus on production with peace of mind." The leadership also specifically pointed out that whoever sows in the spring will reap in the autumn, and everyone's production enthusiasm has changed. Then everyone put forward this year's production plan: In agricultural production, 40 loads of manure per mu, plowed twice, harrowed twice, and cotton and other miscellaneous crops hoed five times. In terms of sideline production, small cooperatives and small factories will be established, indigo will be planted to prepare for opening a dyeing workshop, and a carpentry shop will be opened. It is also planned that everyone will plant five trees. After the meeting, Tian Shilei, an old poor man (61 years old), was hired, and he carried a manure basket to collect manure every day, and has now collected more than 800 jin of manure. His wife has very high weaving skills, and the mother and daughter spin ten taels of cotton a day, which has promoted the production enthusiasm of the whole village. All the able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the village's 23 households have been organized and have begun to send manure to the fields, planning to complete it all within half a month.

　　沁水董家山村
  　订出生产计划
    【太岳消息】沁水董家山河北自然村，在发现贫、中农有等待平分思想后，就深入宣传解释，在旧历正月十八日黑夜，开了一个整理互助组的会议，让大家谈心思。中农田世广、田世隆二个老汉说：“过去只是听说平分啦，不知道究竟怎样办，一天胡思乱想；既然是这样，咱怕什么哩，大家放心闹生产吧”，领导上又特别指出春天谁种地秋天谁收粮，大家生产情绪都变过来了。接着大家又提出今年生产计划：农业生产每亩上粪四十担，犁二遍，耙二遍，棉花及其它杂禾锄五遍。副业生产上开办小型合作社、小型工厂、种蓝准备开染坊，开办一个木作铺。又计划每人栽五棵树。会后雇贫老汉田世雷（六十一岁），就背起了粪篓天天拾粪，现已拾粪八百多斤。他老婆纺织技术很高，母女两个一天纺花十两，推动了全村人的生产情绪。全村二十三户男女全半劳力，都组织起来，开始往地里送粪，计划在半月内全部送完。
