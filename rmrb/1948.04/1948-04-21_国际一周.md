International Week
April 12th to 18th

The bugle of the war of self-defense has resounded throughout the East this week. The reactionary government of Burma, with the support of American and British imperialism, launched a nationwide anti-communist and anti-democratic movement at the end of last month, and dispatched land and air forces to carry out large-scale bloody suppression. This blatant act of openly declaring war on the people immediately aroused the indignation of the Burmese people, who took up arms and fought to defend their independence, democracy, and survival. So far, the flames of self-defense warfare have spread throughout the central, eastern, and southern parts of Burma, as well as the far north. The people's armed forces, under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, now "control considerable areas outside the major cities" (Associated Press); and are actively attacking everywhere, frightening the De Qin Nu reactionary government into hastily declaring martial law in southern Yangon and other places, exclaiming "the situation is serious," and setting up defenses and arresting people everywhere, in a state of extreme nervousness. Even American imperialist officials despairingly said: "The Burmese government may be facing a long and fierce struggle." In Indonesia, the wildfire never dies out, and the spring breeze blows again. The Indonesian people's war of liberation, although it suffered serious setbacks due to the direct intervention of American imperialism and the compromise and surrender of upper-class elements within Indonesia, is still being fought by the heroic Indonesian people. Recent news confirms that guerrilla warfare is still continuing throughout Java and Sumatra. "The Indonesian people's resistance struggle has unfolded with new strength" (TASS), they have learned from painful experiences, consolidated and expanded the people's front, and put forward a clear program: to fight for an independent and unified Indonesian Republic. The Vietnamese people's anti-French war of self-defense is making continuous progress. The Saigon French invasion army headquarters' weekly war report has also had to admit that the Viet Minh People's Army has frequently launched active attacks in various parts of the north and south. In addition, the Indian people continue to resist the Nehru government's anti-communist and anti-democratic movement. Strikes, demonstrations, and protests are taking place in many places. Imprisoned Indian people's leaders have launched heroic hunger strikes in prison; Indian Communist leader Joshi has issued a call, summoning the people to rise up and "repel the infringement on the working class, the people's freedom and democratic rights."

This week is approaching the eve of the Italian general election, and an even more tense and acute struggle has unfolded between the two major camps of democracy and imperialism. American and British imperialism, together with Italian reactionaries, are terrified and viciously trying to use all rogue methods in a vain attempt to make a final struggle. American and British Mediterranean ships have been concentrated in several Italian ports, the United States has urgently shipped 13,000 tons of military supplies to Italy, the US Air Force is prepared to fly over Italy on election day to intimidate, and the Gasperi government is carrying out bribery, provocations, arrests, and killings. But all this has resulted in the Italian people's demonstrations, strikes, protests, and other powerful counterattacks; the democratic front has gained "unexpectedly unanimous support." Facts have proven that all the scare tactics and deceptions of the American, British, and Italian reactionaries are of no use. Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti said well: "Neither the attempt to restore fascism, nor religious terror, nor foreign brutal interference can defeat us. The Italian people's will to fight for national freedom, independence, and economic revival will surely triumph on April 18."

The American people's struggle to defend peace, democracy, and survival is further unfolding. The national conference of the "Wallace Presidential Campaign National Committee" held the week before has resolved to fight for peace and defeat legislation such as conscription and universal military training; and called for the official establishment of a third party in late July. "Save Peace Week" and the "Anti-Universal Military Training Law Movement" have also begun. At the same time, the unity of democratic forces in the United States is greatly strengthening. National democratic student and women's organizations have already been formed. On the other hand, the wave of demands for wage increases and large-scale strikes continues to rise. The number of strikers has reached 600,000, more than 2 million employees have launched wage increase struggles, and a larger-scale strike movement is brewing.

At the same time, the people of Colombia in South America broke out in a spontaneous disturbance against American imperialism and the country's traitorous dictatorial government, which has not yet completely subsided. This incident has frightened American imperialism, and American news agencies trembleingly said that such incidents may "occur in any other poor Latin American country."

The great achievements of Soviet peaceful labor and the further abundance of people's lives that have been reported in the past week are in sharp contrast to the United States, where "deep disorder lies ahead" (Associated Press). The Soviet Union's total industrial output in the first quarter of this year exceeded the plan again, increasing by 32 percent compared with the same quarter last year. The large increase in the proportion of steel, iron, coal, oil, and daily necessities industries in particular shows that the Soviet Union's national strength is further strengthened, and it is predictable that the "Five-Year Plan will be completed in four years." At the same time, due to the fall in prices, the increase in the purchasing power of the ruble, and the increase in wages, the actual wages of workers in the first quarter of this year have greatly increased, and the Soviet Union's second price reduction began on April 10. This is even more proof that the people's lives are becoming more prosperous, "the great development of the Soviet national economy" and "how much the Soviet government cares about improving the welfare of the people."

　　国际一周
    四月十二日至十八日
    自卫战争的号角一周来响遍东方。缅甸反动政府在美英帝国主义支持下，于上月底发动了全国性的反共反民主运动，并出动陆空军实行大规模的血腥弹压。这种甘冒大不韪的公开向人民宣战的举措，立即激起了缅甸人民的义愤，他们拿起武器奋起为保卫独立、民主与生存而战。迄今为止，在缅甸的中、东、南三部及极北部，到处燃遍了自卫战争的烽火。在缅共领导下的人民武装，现已“控制着大城市以外的相当大的地区”（合众社）；并到处积极出击，吓得德钦努反动政府慌忙在仰光南部等地宣布戒严，惊呼“形势严重”，到处设防捕人，草木皆兵。甚至美帝官员亦绝望地说：“缅甸政府可能面临着长期而激烈的斗争局面。”在印尼，野火烧不尽，春风吹又生。印尼人民的解放战争，虽因美帝的直接干涉与印尼内部上层分子的妥协投降，曾遭遇严重挫折，但英勇的印尼人民仍在继续战斗。最近消息证实：游击战争仍在爪哇、苏门答腊全境继续未已。“印尼人民的反抗斗争已以新的力量展开”（塔斯社），他们吸取了痛苦的经验教训，巩固与扩大了人民阵线，并提出了明确的纲领：为独立统一的印尼共和国而战斗。越南人民的抗法自卫战再接再厉，西贡法侵略军指挥部最近一周战报亦不得不供认：越盟人民军在南北各地已频繁地主动出击。此外，印度人民继续抗击尼赫鲁政府反共反民主运动，罢工、示威、抗议正在许多地方发生。被捕的印度人民领袖在狱中已进行英勇的绝食斗争；印共领袖约希已发出号召，召唤人民奋起“击退对工人阶级、人民自由权利与民主的侵犯。”
    本周已临意大利大选前夕，民主与帝国主义两大阵营之间，已展开了更加紧张与尖锐的斗争。美英帝国主义与意国反动派一起，惊惧而穷凶极恶地要尽一切流氓手段，妄图作最后之挣扎。美英地中海舰船已集中于意若干港口，美已急运一万三千吨军火至意，美空军准备于意大选日飞越意上空恫吓，加斯贝利政府则实行贿选、挑衅、逮捕与杀人。但这一切所得到的结果，是意国人民示威、罢工、抗议等等有力反击；是民主阵线获得“出乎意外的一致支持。”事实已经证明：美英意反动派所有吓唬与欺骗的伎俩，是起不了什么作用的。意共总书记托格里亚蒂说得好：“无论恢复法西斯主义的企图、宗教的恐怖、或者外国横暴的干涉，都不能打败我们，意国人民争取国家自由、独立与经济复兴的意志，定将在四月十八日获胜。”
    美国人民保卫和平、民主与生存的斗争进一步展开。周前召开的“华莱士竞选总统全国委员会”全国会议，已决议为和平与击败征兵与普遍军训等立法而斗争；并号召七月下旬正式成立第三党。“拯救和平周”、“反普遍军训法运动”亦已开始。同时，美国民主势力的团结正大大加强中。全国性民主的学生与妇女组织业已组成。另一方面，要求增资与大罢工浪潮仍继续高涨。罢工人数已达六十万，二百余万职工展开了增资斗争，而一个更大规模罢工运动，正在酝酿中。
    与此同时，南美哥伦比亚人民爆发了反对美帝与本国卖国独裁政府的自发性骚动，至今仍未完全停息。这一事变使得美帝惊惶失色，美帝通讯社战战兢兢地说：这类事件可能“在其他任何贫穷的拉丁美洲国家发生。”
    一周间传来苏联和平劳动的伟大业绩以及人民生活的更加丰足，与“深刻的紊乱就摆在面前”（美联社）的美国适成鲜明的对照。苏联今年头一季的工业总产量又超过了计划，较去年同季竟增产达百分之三十二。其中尤其是钢、铁、煤、油及日用品工业增产比例之大，说明苏联国力之更益加强，“五年计划，四年完成”是可预卜的了。同时，由于物价降落、卢布购买力提高及增资的结果，使今年第一季的工人实际工资大为增加，而苏联第二度的物价的降低，又于四月十日开始。这更足证明：人民生活的更加美满，“苏联国民经济的大发展”与“苏联政府何等关心增进人民的福利。”（新华社陕北十九日电）
