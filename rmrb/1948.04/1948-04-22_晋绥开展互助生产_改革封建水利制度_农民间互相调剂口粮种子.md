Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 19th: In various parts of the Jin-Sui area, feudal water conservancy systems are being reformed to maximize the use of water for production development. In the past, in four villages including Zhengxia Village in Daixian County, the landlords and rich peasants in the upper reaches of the canal controlled the water source, wasting water resources. Villages in the lower reaches did not have enough water for irrigation, and their output was greatly reduced. This time, water is distributed uniformly according to the amount of land. Dongxia Village, located in the upper reaches, distributed the excess water to the two villages of Zhengxia, irrigating an additional 15 hectares of land and increasing grain production by more than 300 *shi* (each *shi* is 300 *jin*). The two villages of Zhengxia, in turn, allocated 144 *mu* of land to Dongxia Village, with an output of 120 *shi*, balancing the output of each village and promoting unity and prosperity. The Dayukou canal in Huairen County could originally irrigate the land of four villages, but in the past, the landlords of Dayukou controlled the canal rights, and the other three villages could not get water. Now, a water conservancy committee is jointly formed by the four villages to manage the canal, and water is distributed according to the irrigable land area of each village in sequence. After abolishing the water head system and water rental and other feudal exploitation in Dawu Town, Lishi County, the masses democratically elected personnel to form a water conservancy committee responsible for repairing water conservancy projects and protecting water resources.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 20th: The military and civilians in Jin-Sui are fully engaged in production and disaster relief, and are planting early and planting more summer crops to strive to prevent people from starving to death. The following measures have been taken in various places for this purpose: (1) The problem of food and seed shortages is mainly solved by mutual assistance and adjustment among farmers. The Farmers' Representatives Conference in the Second District of Yu County listened to the report on the disaster situation by representatives of Sangwan Administrative Village, which moved all the participating representatives, who offered to donate money spontaneously. Farmers in Caijiaya Village alone donated 4,000 silver dollars to purchase grain for Sangwan, and transferred all the loan grain issued by the Administrative Office to the district this year to Sangwan and other places. The difficulties in Sangwan have been basically solved. Farmers in Shanyin County donated more than 30,000 *jin* of food to Pinglu County. Ren Shuchun, a middle peasant in Dawu Town, Lishi County, voluntarily donated 13 *shi* of food for disaster relief. This kind of mutual aid movement is now being launched in various places. (2) In areas with a shortage of draft animals, in addition to voluntary organization of labor exchange, Dongxiazhuang in Daixian County organized people to pull plows, with four people working together to pull a plow, which can cultivate three *mu* per day. This method is widely adopted locally. Various places are also cutting a large amount of wild grass to feed livestock to solve the problem of cattle feed shortage. Thirty-odd men, women and children in Wayao Tou, Shuoxian County, cut more than 10,000 *jin* of grass in twelve days, which not only solved the village's own difficulties, but also could be sold. (3) Engage in sideline production during spring plowing. Villages such as Zhangjiabao in Daixian County mobilized each household to boil alkali and refine saltpeter, freeing up livestock to transport goods, and organized various handicraft productions. Sideline income can account for 40% of the annual income, and spring plowing difficulties can be solved. (4) In addition to saving and producing, local government agencies and troops are actively helping the masses with spring plowing. The Suimeng Public Security Bureau donated all the wasteland and farm tools reclaimed last year to the masses in Shenchi, and the Health Department of the Military Region also sent a large amount of fertilizer to the masses in Kelan. Some agencies also drew manpower to help the people with spring plowing.

Also reported: Due to Yan Xishan's disasters and droughts, more than 2,000 disaster victims in the mountainous areas along the edge of Jinzhong. The local democratic government and the Trade Bureau have distributed 260,000 *jin* of grain and more than 50,000 *jin* of cotton to help with spring plowing and develop women's spinning. Those who lack farm tools are provided with loans of farm tools. Refugees who fled from Yan's bandit areas have also been properly resettled and assisted in their production.

　　晋绥开展互助生产  改革封建水利制度
    农民间互相调剂口粮种子
    【新华社晋绥十九日电】晋绥各地改革封建水利制度，使水尽其利以发展生产。代县正下社等四村过去渠头村庄地富统制水源，浪费水利，而下游村庄则浇水不足，产量大减。这次统一按地亩多少分水，渠头之东下社村将多余的水分给下游正下社等两村，多浇地十五顷，增产粮三百余石（每石三百斤）。正下社等两村则给东下社拨地一四四亩，产量一二○石，使各村产量平衡，团结致富。怀仁大峪口水渠原可灌溉四个村土地，但过去被大峪口地主掌握渠权，其他三村均得不到水，现在由四村共同组成水利委员会管理，按各村能灌溉土地面积分水，依序轮流。离石大武镇废除水头制和租水等封建剥削后，由群众民主选出人员组成水利委员会，负责修理水利工程，保护水利。
    【新华社晋绥二十日电】晋绥军民全力开展生产救灾，提前播种及多种夏田争取不饿死人。各地为此已采取如下办法：（一）口粮种子困难，主要由农民间互相帮助调剂解决。与县二区农民代表大会听取了桑湾行政村代表报告灾情后，感动了所有与会代表，纷纷自动提出募捐。仅蔡家崖一村农民即捐助银洋四千元，为桑湾购粮，并将今年行署发放该区的贷粮全部让与桑湾等处。桑湾困难已基本上解决。山阴县农民捐助平鲁县食粮三万余斤。离石大武镇中农任树春自愿捐出救灾粮十三石。此种互助运动，刻在各地发动中。（二）畜力困难，除自愿组织变工外，代县东下庄组织人拉犁，四人伙拉，每天可耕三亩，当地多采用此办法。各地并大量割野草喂牲口，解决牛草困难。朔县瓦窑头三十余男女老少，在十二天中割草万余斤，不仅解决本村困难，且可出卖。（三）在春耕中进行副业生产，代县张家堡等村发动各户熬碱熬硝，抽出牲畜跑脚，并组织各种手工业生产，副业收入可占全年收入百分之四十，春耕困难可以解决。（四）各地机关部队，除节约生产外，并积极帮助群众春耕，绥蒙公安局将去年开垦的荒地及农具，全部送给神池群众，军区卫生部亦送给岢岚群众大量肥料，有的机关并抽出人力助民春耕。
    又讯：晋中边沿山地因阎祸、旱灾，灾民达二千余人。当地民主政府及贸易局已发粮二十六万斤及棉花五万余斤，帮助春耕生产，开展妇纺，缺少农具者则借予农具。阎匪区逃来之难民亦已妥善安置，助其生产。
