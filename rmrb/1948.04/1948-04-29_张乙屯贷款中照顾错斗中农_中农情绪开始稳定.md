[Jilu Yu News] In Zhang Yitun, Fifth District of Nanfeng, wrongly struggled middle peasants were taken care of in the spring plowing and disaster relief loan program, stabilizing the production mood of general middle peasants. Half of Zhang Yitun's farmland was flooded last year, causing difficulties in the lives of the masses this spring. Now the district government has issued more than 440,000 yuan in loans for relief. Special care was given to the eight middle peasant households who were wrongly struggled in the land reform last year. For example, Liu Wu used to work as a hired laborer for five years, had two people in his family, sixteen mu of land, and also sold steamed buns. Before the re-examination, he voluntarily gave up five mu of land, but during the re-examination, he was swept out of his house. Now he has no way to live. Zhang Chunhe, seven people in his family, thirty-four mu of land, was classified as a "declining rich peasant" because his father had hired people when he was young. Seventeen mu and six fen of his land were flooded last year, and no reduction or exemption was given when he paid the public grain. He was also detained by the district for four months on suspicion of "sabotage," and handed over 600 jin of rice for maintenance. This year, his family ran out of food very early and relied on small loans and his wife's weaving of wool hats to barely survive. In this spring plowing and disaster relief loan program, after discussion by the farmers' association, Liu Wu was first compensated with three mu and seven fen of land, and he was given a loan of 30,000 yuan to solve his living problems. Zhang Chunhe was also given a loan of 50,000 yuan as production capital. Their relief has had a great impact among the middle peasant class. A few days ago, eight or nine people were chatting by the lotus pond. One middle peasant pointed to the lotus pond and said, "These lotus roots have already been wasted by me for half of them. Every time I go to the market, I always buy good things to eat. I used to feel like I was standing on the edge of a pit, not knowing when I would be pushed into the water (meaning being struggled against). Who am I saving for?" He also said, "We can't do this anymore in the future. The higher-ups have really changed. They really don't struggle against middle peasants anymore, and they even take care of middle peasants. If I waste any more, it will all be my own stuff!" Another person who was classified as a well-to-do middle peasant said, "This loan to Zhang Chunhe and Liu Wu is better than the district chief giving several lectures on the 'Legal Program.' In the past, they also said they wouldn't struggle against middle peasants, but then they did. This time, they really want to take care of middle peasants. In the past, I was standing in the water, but now I'm not afraid anymore." The general panic among the middle peasants has been initially stabilized by this loan.

    张乙屯贷款中照顾错斗中农
    中农情绪开始稳定
    【冀鲁豫消息】南峰五区张乙屯，在春耕救灾贷款中，照顾了被斗错的中农，稳定了一般中农的生产情绪。张乙屯因去年水淹了一半耕地，造成今春群众生活困难。现在区政府发下贷款四十四万多元来救济。救济时特别照顾了去年土改中斗错了的八户中农。比如刘五以前扛过五年活，两口人，十六亩地，兼卖馍馍生意。未复查前他自动拿出过五亩地，复查中竟扫地出门。现在没法生活。张春和，七口人，三十四亩地，因父亲年轻时雇过人，复查中被划为“破落富农”。去年他被水淹地十七亩六分，交公粮时一亩也没减免。又因有“破坏”嫌疑，被区扣押四个月，交给养米六百斤。今年他家很早已断粮，依靠零碎借贷和其妻织羊毛帽子来勉强渡日。在这次春耕救灾贷款中，由农会讨论，首先赔偿给刘五三亩七分地，贷给他三万元，解决生活问题，又贷给张春和五万元作生产资本。他们的被救济，在中农阶层中影响很大。前几天八九个人在藕池边上闲谈，一个中农指着藕池说：“这些藕已经叫我浪费了一半了。我每次赶集，总要买好东西吃。我以前觉的是站在坑边，不知啥时候就被推到水里了（被斗争的意思），省着给谁？”他又说：“以后可不能这样闹了，上级确实变了，真的不斗中农了，还照顾中农哩，再浪费还不都是自己的东西？”另一个被划为富裕中农的说：“这次贷给张春和跟刘五的款，比区长讲几次‘法大纲’还强哩。过去也说不斗中农，后来又斗了，这次可是真的要照顾中农了。过去我是站在水里的人，这下子可不害怕啦。”一般中农的恐慌情绪，经这次贷款已初步稳定下来。
