　　Pingshun Second District Strengthens Production Leadership
  　Dissolves Fake Poor Peasant Associations to Promote Spring Plowing
    [Pingshun News] After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, some degenerate bad cadres and some honorably discharged soldiers in the Second District of Pingshun deliberately caused trouble, organized fake poor peasant associations, intimidated middle peasants, and retaliated against other cadres. This was especially serious in Fodangling, Shenjiaping, and Hanjiacun. Lu Youcai, a bad cadre in Fodangling, forcibly dragged the masses to the people's school, carrying a hemp rope ready to beat cadres. Han Jingwen and honorably discharged soldier Han Hou'an from Hanjiacun organized together, cursing cadres in the village, making it impossible for cadres to work. They planned to replace all the cadres and even threatened to kill Han Zhiqin. The fake poor peasant association in Shenjiaping organized more than 30 people and made plans to distribute middle peasant women using the method of "grabbing paper bullets". In the forty days since the fake poor peasant association was established, meetings resulted in dismantling the lumber from two public buildings. Middle peasants were not allowed to sell grain, causing panic and lowering production morale. After the fake poor peasant association was established in Xiwang, landlord Liu Shuangou infiltrated it, causing dissatisfaction among the masses and making the cadres worry and give up. They stopped working. Most of the district cadres' efforts were focused on conducting "draw and supplement" in villages, leaving only three district cadres to handle production in all twenty-seven villages in the district. They were unable to cope, and as a result, the district's production work collapsed. On March 19th, the county government convened a cadre meeting to deploy production work, enabling district cadres to have a correct understanding of production work. In order to promote production, the Second District held an enlarged cadre meeting on March 25th, resolved the ideological problem of village cadres giving up work, and mobilized everyone to accept the opinions of the masses and lead production well, which would reduce mistakes. They opened up the minds of cadres, deployed spring plowing production work, established a production committee, and resolved the remaining problems in mutual aid to promote production. In order to remove obstacles to production, they first took action to solve the fake poor peasant associations in Shenjiaping and Hanjiacun. After the district cadres arrived in Shenjiaping, they first learned about the activities of the fake poor peasant association from honest farmers, and then convened a meeting of middle and poor peasants to resolve the issues. At the meeting, the mistakes of the fake poor peasant association were exposed, and everyone offered many opinions to them, asking them to make self-criticisms. Kao Ze said: "I organized the poor peasant association not to lead the poor people to turn over, but to attack cadres." After the self-criticism, the village chief said: "I am really happy today. I have clarified the problem. In the future, everyone should work hard on production. If there are any problems with the cadres, we will solve them during the 'draw and supplement'." Finally, the leadership officially announced that all poor peasant associations organized without the work team would be dissolved; and correctly explained to the masses the importance of the poor peasant association and the nature of the Land Law. Hanjiacun also adopted the same method to dissolve the fake poor peasant association, and the morale of the masses stabilized. The fake poor peasant associations in these two villages organized more than 60 people, but only six people were manipulating them, and the rest were honest farmers who were deceived. After the exposure, the honest farmers all spoke their minds, and everyone realized that they had been fooled by bad people and suffered losses by following bad people. For example, Guo Sanze, an honest farmer from Hanjiacun, said: "I didn't agree with the meeting a few days ago, but I didn't dare to say it. If we have opinions on the cadres, we should correct them. We are not helping, but retaliating, and not being reasonable." After everyone's thinking was straightened out, they elected the spring plowing committee the next day and began to rectify mutual aid. Now the production morale in the entire district has been greatly improved, and most of the manure has been sent out. They are preparing to chop firewood and carry coal, and at the same time launch a tree planting and land reclamation campaign. According to statistics from five villages including Hanjiainan Saichi, 6,500 trees were planted in three days, and 40 mu of sandy land have been reclaimed. Currently, mutual aid groups throughout the district are organizing eight blacksmith shops to repair farm tools and furniture. (Ke Ze, Zhen Guo)

　　平顺二区加强生产领导
  　解散假贫农团开展春耕
    【平顺消息】土地法大纲公布后，平顺二区一部分蜕化坏干部及一些荣退军人故意捣乱，组织假贫农团，威吓中农，打击报复其他干部。特别是佛堂岭、申家坪、韩家村，闹得更不象话。佛堂岭的一个坏干部路有才，强拉群众上民校，手提着麻绳准备打干部。韩家村韩景文和荣退军人韩候安等组织在一块，在村乱骂干部，闹得干部不能进行工作，他们计划把干部全换了，还提出要打死韩芝琴。申家坪假贫农团组织了三十余人，把中农女人用抓纸弹办法做了计划，准备分配。假贫农团成立四十来天，开会就拆烘了两间公楼房的木料。不准中农卖粮食，引起中农恐慌，降低了生产情绪。西湾成立假贫农团后，被地主刘双狗钻进去，闹得群众不满意，干部都发愁躺倒，工作都不干了。区干部力量大部放在进行抽补村庄，全区二十七个村只留下三个区干部搞生产，照顾不过来，结果全区生产工作垮了台。三月十九日县府召开干部会议，布置生产工作，使区干部对生产工作有了正确认识。二区为了推动生产，特在三月二十五日召开扩干会议，解决了村干部躺倒不干的思想，动员大家接受群众意见好好领导生产，就能减轻错误，打通了干部思想，布置了春耕生产工作，成立生产委员会，解决互助中的遗留问题推动生产。为去掉生产障碍，首先动手解决申家坪、韩家村的假贫农团。区干部到申家坪后，首先从老实农民中了解假贫农团的活动事实，然后召开了中贫农解疙＠大会，会上并揭发了假贫农团的过错，大家对他们提了许多意见，叫他们检讨。考则说：“我组织贫农团，不是为领导穷人翻身，而是想打击干部”。检讨后村长说：“我今天真高兴，可把问题弄明白了，今后大家好好闹生产，干部有什么问题，咱到抽补中解决。”最后领导上正式宣布了不经过工作队组织的贫农团一律解散；并正确地向群众解释了贫农团的重要和土地法的性质。韩家村也采取了同样方式解散了假贫农团，群众情绪安定。这两村的假贫农团共组织了六十余人，但只有六个人在内操纵，其余都是被欺骗的老实农民。经揭发后，老实农民都说了心里话，大家都认识了是上了坏人的当，跟上坏人吃了亏。如韩家村老实农民郭三则说：“前几天开会我就不赞成，只是不敢说吧，咱和干部有意见，给他提出纠正就对了，咱这不是帮助是报复，不讲道理。”大家思想弄通后，第二天就选举春耕委员会，进行整顿互助，现在全区生产情绪已大大提高，粪已大部送出，正准备打柴驮煤，同时展开植树开荒运动。如韩家南赛池等五村统计，三天植树六千五百棵，沙地栈已开荒四十亩，现全区互助组正组织八个铁匠炉，修理农具家具。（科则、振国）
