 Rectifying Mutual Aid to Intensify Spring Ploughing

[News from this newspaper] Since the Border Region Government issued the proclamation of "whoever cultivates owns the harvest," it has played a significant role in stabilizing the public's sentiment and promoting spring ploughing and production. Once the masses understood the situation, their enthusiasm for production immediately surged. Villages where ideological problems were resolved quickly rectified mutual aid and entered into enthusiastic spring ploughing action. For example, in Qiushuyuan, Licheng, the masses' thoughts were once so confused that middle and poor peasants dared not speak to each other. Poor peasants were afraid that middle peasants would report them if they spoke, and middle peasants were afraid of being accused of spying if they spoke to poor peasants. Production was even more lax. After propaganda and explanation, the mutual aid groups held meetings on their own initiative to study the current production work. Liu Fushan's team is plowing the land and planting hemp stalks in cotton stalks; other teams are also taking action. In Suicheng, Zuoquan, the masses were very passive in production in the previous stage. The masses had two main thoughts: poor peasants were waiting to exchange for better land before taking action, and middle peasants were afraid of drawing land out and also didn't want to act. After discussion and resolution, all seven brigades and twenty-one groups in the village were rectified and measures for converting livestock labor into work points were formulated. People and livestock are now busy delivering manure. Because Dongfeng稔 in Xiyang had early propaganda and explanation, production started early. From last winter to now, the village has added 30 cattle (3 from poor and hired peasants, 27 from new and old middle peasants) and exchanged 40 bad donkeys for good donkeys. There are only two households in the village without livestock. Because of sufficient animal power, more wheat was planted last year. This spring, there are plans to eliminate wasteland, with each household increasing by two to three mu. Each team and group is rectifying mutual aid and carrying out land reclamation. In Cui Jiayu, District Nine, Pingding, the Chen Yinshuo mutual aid group, after rectification and mobilization, rationally divided labor. The elderly delivered manure, the youth planted hemp, the vegetable gardens have been planted, and two mu of new land have been cultivated. They are now turning to coal transportation in preparation for sowing. After the rectification of 14 mutual aid groups in Shentou Village, Shexian County, most of the embankments in the village were built, hemp seeds were sown, and 800 mu of land have been plowed. After the rectification of the Xiyu mutual aid group in Xiyang, some people looked for new partners to reorganize, and some formulated plans. The village organized eight teams and nineteen groups. The labor cooperative, based on needs, extracted ten people from each team to make rakes, producing 130 rakes. In addition to self-use, they also sold them for 260,000 yuan. The village has 120 full laborers and 44 semi-laborers. Within half a month, they carried 3,475 loads of manure, built 59 ridges, pressed 10 kilns of smoked soil, dug 1,090 loads of barren soil, gathered 70 loads of firewood, and carried 163 loads of coal. Old man Wang Cunlu combined with five old men to form a group. Two young people, seeing the old men working steadily, also joined, and are now working enthusiastically.
