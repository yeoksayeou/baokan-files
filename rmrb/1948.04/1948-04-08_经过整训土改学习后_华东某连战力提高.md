Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 6th: In the battle to capture Yilin (southwest of Funing), a certain company of the People's Liberation Army captured thirteen machine guns, six submachine guns, four 60mm mortars, one mortar, and over a hundred rifles with very few casualties, exceeding the original plan. In the past, this company often fought poorly in previous battles, and sometimes didn't even capture a single machine gun. Before this battle, the entire company underwent new-style rectification, launched a campaign to pour out grievances, studied land reform, and researched the reasons for fighting poorly in past battles. By comparing the past with the present, their hatred of the enemy and combat effectiveness greatly improved. When they received the mission to attack Yilin, the entire company held a resolution meeting, filled with excitement, and formulated a plan to kill the enemy, proposing: "Taking Yilin is the first shot after rectification, and it should be particularly loud," and "Seize enemy weapons to strengthen our own equipment." In the battle, the leadership promoted military democracy, and the soldiers collectively brainstormed tactical actions such as how to pass through the enemy's water-filled moats, deliver explosives, and choose assault routes. These were then studied by the squads and platoons, and approved by the company commander. As a result, the first squad opened a breakthrough without any casualties. Lao Hu, a liberated soldier, and his combat team crossed the communication trench during a lull in the enemy's bunker fire and launched a fierce attack from the side, eliminating the Jiang bandits in the bunker. Lao Hu always rushed to the front to capture prisoners, and shook the prisoners' hands, saying with a smile: "As long as you lay down your weapons, we will treat you as friends." When the enemy in the fortifications heard this, they shouted "We won't fight anymore" and laid down their weapons one after another. Other combat teams also successfully eliminated the enemy and captured a large number of prisoners. The company is now equipped with American weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has recently created a method of issuing "Certificates of Honor" and recording merits in a timely manner on the battlefield, which has greatly boosted morale. Generally, receiving three "Certificates of Honor" is equivalent to recording a minor merit. Those who receive one or two "Certificates of Honor" can still have their merits recorded when they accumulate three. However, at the end of the battle, a battle evaluation must still be conducted according to the method of reporting merits, and if it is considered that too many were issued, some will be deducted, and if too few were issued, some will be added, and any omissions will be supplemented. The right to issue "Certificates of Honor" on the battlefield belongs to the squad, platoon, and company cadres. Squad and platoon leaders can issue no more than two "Certificates of Honor" at a time, but squad and platoon cadres who perform assault tasks can issue three at a time. In the Siping Campaign, a certain company of this unit implemented this method, which sparked a wave of killing the enemy and earning merits throughout the company. Forty-six soldiers earned a total of one hundred and seventy-one Certificates of Honor.

Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 6th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has created a new method of three-person teams on the training ground during military training. Each platoon first has the platoon leader explain the key points of the movements, and then forms three-person teams, with a designated leader to lead the way, one person calling out the commands, one person performing the movements, and one person correcting the movements on the side. The three people take turns teaching and acting. This is a new organizational form of officer teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, soldiers teaching soldiers, and mass military training. The companies that have implemented it have all achieved great results.

　　经过整训土改学习后
  　华东某连战力提高
    【新华社华东前线六日电】攻克益林（阜宁西南）之战中，解放军某连以极少伤亡，缴获机枪十三挺、冲锋机枪六挺、六○炮四门、迫击炮一门、步枪百余支，俘虏甚多，战绩超过原定计划。该连过去在历次战斗中常打不好仗，甚至没缴得一挺机枪。此次战斗前全连经过新式整训，展开诉苦，学习土改，研究历次打不好仗的原因，想想过去比比现在，敌忾心和战斗力大大提高。接到进攻益林任务时，全连召开决心会，情绪激昂，制订了杀敌计划，提出：“拿下益林是整训后的第一炮，应该打得特别响”，“夺取敌人武器加强自己装备”。在战斗中，领导上发扬军事民主，对于如何通过敌阵水圩、送炸药、选择冲锋道路等战术动作，都由战士们集体想办法，经班排研究，连指挥员同意。因此，一班无一伤亡打开了突破口。解放战士老胡的战斗组乘敌地堡火力间隙时越过交通沟，从侧面猛攻，解决了地堡内的蒋匪。老胡一直冲在前头捉俘虏，并握着俘虏的手笑道：“只要你们放下武器，咱们就当朋友看待”。工事里的敌人听到这话，高喊“我们也不打了”，纷纷放下武器。其他各战斗组也胜利地解决了敌人，捉到大批俘虏。现该连已美械装备。
    【新华社东北六日电】解放军某部近创造战场上发给“光荣证”及时记功办法，对鼓舞士气作用很大。一般获得三个“光荣证”即折记一小功，获得一个或两个“光荣证”者，待积满三个时，仍可记功。但至战斗结束时，仍需根据报功方法再进行战评，如认为发多的减去，发少的增加，遗漏的补发。战场上颁发“光荣证”之权，属于班、排、连干部。班、排长可一次颁发两个以下的“光荣证”，惟担任突击任务的班排干部，则可一次颁发三个。该部某连在四平战役中，执行这种办法，全连掀起杀敌立功热潮，全连有四十六人争取到一百七十一个光荣证。
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线六日电】解放军某部在练兵中创造操场上的三人小组新方法。各排先由排长讲解动作要领，然后三人一组，指定组长带开，一人喊口令，一人作动作，一人在一边纠正动作，三人轮番教学作，这是官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵、群众性练兵方法的一种新的组织形式，实行的连队，都收效甚大。
