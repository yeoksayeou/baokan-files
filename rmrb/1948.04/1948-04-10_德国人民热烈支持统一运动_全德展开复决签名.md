　　German People Warmly Support the Unification Movement
  　All-Germany Launches Referendum Signatures
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th] Berlin Dispatch: In accordance with the resolution of the Second All-German People's Congress, the signature campaign for a referendum on the German unification issue is being launched throughout Germany and has received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the people. According to the Deutsche Nachrichten newspaper, even in Mannheim, a city in the Wurtemberg-Baden state of the American occupation zone, 4,315 people signed within two hours. Walter Ulbricht, Chairman of the German Socialist Unity Party, elaborated on the national referendum, stating that the referendum vote will be carried out through workers' signatures in enterprises and residents' signatures in their homes in urban and rural areas. For this purpose, the People's Committee will establish various organizations to carry out this movement and print a booklet entitled "National Referendum on the German Unification Issue in Accordance with the Principles of the Weimar Constitution." When Ulbricht spoke about the possibility of the Western occupation authorities prohibiting the referendum signature campaign in their zone, he emphasized: "People can prohibit everything, but no one can prevent the people from expressing their will on the most important issue of their life and death rights."

　　德国人民热烈支持统一运动
  　全德展开复决签名
    【新华社陕北五日电】柏林讯：依照德国第二次全国代表大会决议，对德国统一问题举行复决的签名运动，正在全德展开，并已得到广大人民的热烈支持。据德意志新闻报导：甚至在美占区瓦登堡——巴登州的曼亥谟城，两小时内签名人数即达四千三百十五名。德国统一社会党主席格罗提渥对全国复决加以阐述称：复决投票的实行，将采取企业中工人的签名与城乡居民在其家庭中签名的办法。为此目的，人民委员会将设立各种组织来开展这个运动，并印发题为“符合威玛宪法原则之德国统一问题全国复决”之表册。格氏在谈到如果西占区当局禁止在该区进行复决签名时，强调指出：“人们可以禁止一切事情，但没有人能阻止人民表示他们对生死权利这个最重要问题的意志。”
