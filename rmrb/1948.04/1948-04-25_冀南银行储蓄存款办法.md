　　Jinan Bank Savings Deposit Measures
    I. This business is specifically for savings by organs, troops, cadres, staff, workers, and employees of public and private enterprises. For convenience, only current savings deposits will be offered.
    II. Term: Deposits and withdrawals are limited to one to two times per month. If savings are interrupted for more than two months, they will be treated as ordinary deposits. Savings periods are divided into three months or more, six months or more, and one year. Once determined, they cannot be changed.
    III. Interest rate: Savings deposits accrue monthly compound interest. The provisional monthly interest rate is set at three percent for deposits exceeding one month, three and a half percent for deposits exceeding three months, four percent for deposits exceeding six months, and four and a half percent for deposits exceeding one year.
    IV. Procedures: Once a savings deposit account is opened, the Bank will issue a savings deposit book. Future deposits and withdrawals will be made with the book. If the deposit book is lost, the Bank should be notified immediately to report the loss. The Bank is not responsible for fraudulent withdrawals before the loss is reported.
    V. Amount: The minimum amount for each deposit is 1,000 yuan, and the maximum is 100,000 yuan. When cadres and staff of organs and troops open accounts with deposits exceeding 100,000 yuan, a letter of certification from the responsible organ and person in charge should be attached. During the savings period, the remaining balance after each withdrawal must not be less than fifty percent of the total deposit amount.
