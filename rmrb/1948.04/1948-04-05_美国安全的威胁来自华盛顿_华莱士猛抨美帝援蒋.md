　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Washington dispatch: Wallace, while testifying before the US Senate Military Committee on March 29th, demanded that the US authorities withdraw American troops from China, Greece, and other places. He said, "The Chinese people do not support the current (Chiang) regime, and aid to China (Chiang) will be wasted." Wallace pointed out: The Soviet Union never needs war; the Soviet Union is a peace-loving country. Wallace then vehemently attacked the current policy of the US government, saying: The threat to American security comes from Washington, not from elsewhere. Truman is using artificial crises to force Congress and the American people to accept universal military training and conscription in order to protect the interests of major corporations abroad, at the expense of American taxpayers' money. When Wallace spoke at Brooklyn College in New York on the 31st, he ridiculed the US Navy Secretary's claim that foreign submarines had been discovered in US waters, calling it a useless intimidation of the American people. At the same time, Congressman Sadowski, in a speech in the House of Representatives, also emphasized his opposition to American interference in the internal affairs of European and Asian countries. He said, "The American people are disgusted to see emperors, queens, and decrepit dynasties, moribund European militarists, and conservatives flocking to the United States."
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS Moscow dispatch: The Labor Daily, in an article on the 1st regarding the American working class's struggle against the attacks of monopoly capitalists, stated: "The aggressive policy openly adopted by the American ruling class in its foreign policy and the all-out attack on the vital interests of the American working masses are two sides of the same coin." It pointed out: "The opposition of many large trade unions to the Marshall Plan, their support for the establishment of a third party, and their endorsement of Wallace's campaign are of great significance. This proves the American people's dissatisfaction with the government's domestic and foreign policies, and proves that the monopoly capitalists, who want to turn the United States into a police and militarized state, have failed to suppress the voice of the progressive American people, a voice that is meeting with ever-greater resonance."

　　美国安全的威胁来自华盛顿 　 华莱士猛抨美帝援蒋
    【新华社陕北三日电】华盛顿讯：华莱士三月二十九日在美参院军委会作证时，要求美当局自中国、希腊及其他地方撤退美军。他说：“中国老百姓不支持目前的（蒋）政权，对华（蒋）援助将被浪费。”华氏指出：苏联从不需要战争，苏联是爱好和平的国家。华氏继即猛烈攻击美政府的现行政策说：美国安全的威胁来自华盛顿，而不是其他。杜鲁门以人为的危机来强迫国会和美国人民接受普遍军训和征兵，以便保护各大公司在外国的利益，而耗费的却是美国纳税人的金钱。华氏三十一日在纽约布鲁克林大学演说时，嘲笑美海长谓美海面发现外国潜艇之说，称之为是对美国人民的无益恫吓。同时，众议员沙多夫斯基在众院演说时亦强调反对美国干涉欧亚各国的内政。他说：“美国人民眼见皇帝、皇后，以及老朽的王朝、死亡的欧洲军国主义者和保守党徒成群的投奔美国，实在厌恶”。
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报于一日论美国工人阶级反对垄断资本家的进攻之斗争称：“美国统治阶级在外交政策中所公开采取的侵略政策，和对美国劳苦大众生死利益的全面进攻，是一个事物的两面”。指出：“许多大职工会的反对马歇尔计划，支持建立第三党和拥护华莱士的竞选，具有重大意义，这证明美国人民对政府所奉行的内外政策底不满，并证明着想把美国变为一个警察和军国主义化国家的垄断资本家们，没有能压倒美国进步人民的呼声，这呼声正遇到愈来愈大的回响。”
