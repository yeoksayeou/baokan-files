　　Stabilizing Emotions Promotes Spring Planting

　　Shexian Organizes Production Teams to Go to the Countryside

　　[Shexian News] On the 17th of last month, Shexian held a county-wide mobilization meeting for district and village cadres to promote production, initially resolving the ideological problems of some village cadres. After the meeting, mass meetings were generally held in various villages to carry out publicity and education on the democratic land redistribution policy and the Border Region Government's announcement on "whoever plants, harvests," calling on the masses to act quickly and carry out spring plowing. This has changed the chaotic state of most villages in the past, stabilized the emotions of the masses, and motivated them to take action. For example, after returning from the county, the cadres of Nangang Village in the Ninth District publicized the Border Region Government's announcement to the masses. After hearing the announcement, middle peasant Hou Laoxiu spun two liang of cotton without sleeping and regretted not spinning cotton while waiting for equal distribution in the spring. Now the whole village is rectifying mutual aid teams, repairing cotton fields, and repairing land to send manure. Production committees have now been established in all villages in the First District. After publicity and mobilization, the whole district is planting a large number of trees. More than five villages have planted more than 6,000 trees in five days, and Nanzhuang Village has planted more than 3,000 trees in three days. The Houchi Village in the Sixth District has established a production coordination committee of nine people, specifically responsible for coordinating labor and livestock and solving difficulties in production. Production plans are made among the masses to organize livestock to send wood to Wu'an; and first dig open the pumpkin kilns to expose them to the sun more, so that the seedlings can sprout earlier when planting. In addition, the whole village also planted 1,423 various fruit trees. In addition, some villages have not done a good job in publicity and explanation, the masses' thinking has not been thoroughly resolved, and the enthusiasm for production is not high. In order to promote production and strengthen the publicity and education of the democratic land redistribution policy, the county leadership organized a spring plowing work inspection team of 23 cadres after the county cadre reorganization (on the 26th of last month), and went to work in various districts on the 27th. Before going down, the incorrect idea that good cadres engage in land reform and bad cadres engage in production was first resolved, and the task was clarified as implementing the resolutions and production policies of the Spring Plowing Committee and strengthening the production leadership of various villages. The first task is to implement the publicity and education of the democratic land redistribution policy and the Border Region Government's announcement, stabilize the production emotions of the masses, and organize and lead production according to the different situations of each district and village. For example, in the Fifth District, we should now seize the time to repair the beach land, and seize the time to repair the canals along the river. In general, we should quickly promote the rectification of mutual aid to solve the remaining problems. In addition, the following tasks should be understood and promoted: 1. The degree of disaster and immigration issues in the disaster-stricken villages in each district. 2. Solve the difficulties of agricultural tools and seeds, organize blacksmiths to repair agricultural tools, understand the shortage of seeds, and carry out mutual aid coordination. 3. Check and supervise tree planting, especially along the river, each person must plant three live trees. 4. Investigate and understand loans. 5. Cooperate with cadres and schools in various districts to organize temple fair publicity. 6. The public land of the village and county and the land of organs and schools planted by the masses. If it has been handed over but not distributed, the masses should be allowed to discuss temporarily lending it to farmers with little or no land. Village finances and village-stored fruits should be used in production to help the masses solve difficulties. 7. The masses should be free to buy and sell, and cooperative shares should not be restricted. (Li Zhong, Lan Bang)

　　安定情绪推动春耕
  　涉县组织生产队下乡
    【涉县消息】涉县在上月十七号，召开全县区村干部生产动员大会，初步解决了一部分村干部的思想问题。大会后各村普遍召开了群众大会，进行民主填补政策和边府谁种谁收布告的宣传教育，号召群众迅速行动起来进行春耕。这样使大部分村庄改变了过去混乱状态，安定了群众情绪，并积极的行动起来。如九区南岗村干部从县回去后，就向群众宣传。中农侯老秀听了边府布告，不睡觉就纺了二两花，并后悔春天等待平分没纺花。现全村都在整顿互助组，修理花田，修地送粪。一区各村现都成立了生产委员会，经宣传动员，全区正在大量栽树，余个村五天栽树六千余棵，南庄一村三天栽树三千余棵。六区后池村成立了生产调剂委员会九个人，专门负责调剂劳畜力，解决生产中的困难。在群众中订出生产计划，组织牲口往武安送木料；并先把南瓜窑刨开多晒太阳，下种能早出芽。另外全村还栽了各种果木树一千四百廿三棵。此外，还有部分村因宣传解释工作做的差，群众思想未彻底解决，生产情绪还不高。县里领导上为了推动生产，加强民主填补政策的宣传教育，在县里干部整编（上月二十六号）结束后，特组织了二十三个干部的春耕工作检查队，于二十七号分别到各区工作。在下去前首先解决了某些干部认为好干部搞土改，坏干部搞生产的不正确想法，明确任务是贯彻春耕委员会的决议和生产方针，加强各村的生产领导。下去首先是贯彻民主填补政策和边府布告的宣传教育，安定群众生产情绪，并根据各区村不同情况组织领导生产。如：五区现在应抓紧修滩地，沿河抓紧修渠，一般的应赶快推动整顿互助，解决遗留问题。此外，下去还要了解与推动以下几个工作：一、各区灾荒村，灾荒程度和移民问题。二、解决农具种籽困难，组织铁匠炉修理农具，了解种籽缺数，进行互助调剂。三、检查督促植树，特别是沿河边，每人要栽活三棵。四、调查了解贷款。五、配合各区干部和学校组织庙会宣传。六、村县公产地和机关学校种群众之土地，如已交出未分配者，要让群众讨论暂借给无地少地的农民，村财政和村存果实要用到生产中去，帮助群众解决困难。七、群众买卖要自由，合作社抽入股也不能限制。（立忠、兰榜）
