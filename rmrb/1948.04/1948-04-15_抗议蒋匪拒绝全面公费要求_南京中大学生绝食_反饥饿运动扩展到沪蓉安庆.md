Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: The just struggle of students in the Chiang-controlled areas against hunger and for full public funding has unfolded in Nanjing, the heart of the Chiang bandit gang. According to a foreign news agency report on the 11th, 130 students at Central University have begun a hunger strike to protest the Chiang bandit Ministry of Education's rejection of the demand for full public funding.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Comprehensive reports from the Chiang-controlled areas: The just struggle against hunger by students and faculty members in the Chiang-controlled areas has spread throughout Shanghai and Anqing. In Shanghai, impoverished students, along with the Joint Association for Rescuing the Education Crisis, the Primary School Teachers' Joint In-service Training Association, and the Secondary Education Research Association, jointly hosted a press conference on March 27th, putting forward ten appeals, including full public funding for students in public universities and middle schools with monthly adjustments based on the cost of living index, increased teacher salaries and rice rations, and tuition waivers for basic education for schoolchildren. During the press conference, Wu Guozhen, the fascist bandit mayor of Shanghai, dispatched seven plainclothes special agents to obstruct it. In Anqing, the Anhui University Professors' Association held a members' meeting in mid-March and decided to send Qi Zhixin, Dean of the Agricultural College, and Cao Ziyan and Gao Gongbai as representatives to Nanjing to petition, proposing seven demands, including issuing salaries based on the actual price index and adjusting them monthly, implementing in-kind distribution, increasing student public funding, and subsidizing education expenses for faculty children. Professors at the university have begun an indefinite suspension of teaching as a backing, and all staff members also went on strike for one day on March 19th in response.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS, Shanghai, 10th: Over a thousand students in Chengdu held an anti-hunger demonstration on April 9th, demanding food rations and opposing the export of rice from famine-stricken Sichuan. (Chiang bandit) police used clubs to beat the students, and many students were arrested and injured.
