Licheng News: The Licheng Dongguan work team, in reviewing the initial stage of mobilizing poor and hired peasants, focused on visiting and examining these groups, working day and night only with a few of them (which, of course, was a correct emphasis). However, they did not sufficiently study and analyze the overall situation. As a result, in over twenty days, they failed to fully understand the village's circumstances or the characteristics of its class relations, and the work made little progress, leading to discouragement and fatigue.

The work team, upon discovering this situation, immediately convened a forum for poor and hired peasants to review the shortcomings of the previous stage. The peasants spoke their minds, and based on their opinions, the following problems were identified:

1. The work team did not delegate enough authority and failed to rely on the poor and hired peasants to take control themselves. The leadership only provided general guidance, and the peasants followed along. The work team would announce, "We're having a meeting today," and they would notify people, so the initiative and enthusiasm of the poor and hired peasants were not brought into play.

2. In the initial mobilization of the poor and hired peasants, democracy was not sufficiently promoted. Some peasants were afraid to speak boldly and simply followed others. For example, the poor peasant woman Liang Cuiyun had her opinion rejected once during a speech, and she didn't speak again afterward. The leadership did not provide enough help and support to these honest peasants who were not good at speaking.

3. The mobilization of the poor and hired peasants was not sufficiently linked to their vital interests. For example, the livelihood of the manual laborers (stone masons) depended on grinding stones, and the continuous meetings prevented them from going out to earn a living. Therefore, they complained that they couldn't even afford salt these days.

After discovering the above problems, the work team conducted a review and recognized that the reason for the sluggish movement was mainly a leadership issue. The guidance of the movement stemmed from their own subjective thinking, and they didn't pay attention to the demands of the poor and hired peasants, committing the error of paternalistic control. The work guidelines and steps were also not clear enough. They also discussed future actions. The poor peasant Wang Fucun said, "Our strength is small, and many poor peasants have not been absorbed yet. Our ranks need to be expanded quickly." He proposed opening the door to recruit more members, expanding the ranks. After resolving the above problems, the number of poor and hired peasants increased from seventy-three to ninety-three, and the Poor Peasants' Association was officially established on the 24th.

　　黎城东关工作消沉询问群众改进领导
    【黎城消息】黎城东关工作组，检讨在前一段发动贫雇中，着重访贫雇与审查贫雇，白天黑夜只在几个贫雇身上进行活动（当然这重点是对的），但对全面情况研究分析不够，因此二十多天当中，对该村情况不能全部了解，村中阶级关系及特点也不清楚，工作没大进展，大家情绪消沉疲塌。工作组发现这种情况，即召集贫雇座谈。检讨前一段的缺点，贫雇说出了真心话。据他们意见，研究出有以下问题：一、工作组放手不够，没依靠贫雇自己来掌握，领导上只是一般指导，贫雇跟着干。工作组说今天咱要开会啦，他们通知通知，所以没有发挥了贫雇的自动与积极性。二、在初发动贫雇中，民主发扬不够，有些贫雇不敢大胆说话，跟上别人走。如贫雇妇女梁翠云有一次在发言中，别人把她的意见打回去，她以后就不说话。领导上对这些不会说话的老实贫雇帮助扶植不够。三、发动贫雇与贫雇切身利益的结合不够，例如手工业工人（石匠）依靠断磨维持生活，一直连续的开会，拖的他不能到外边做营生，所以他反映说这几天连斤盐也吃不上了。经发现以上问题，工作小组进行了检讨，认识运动消沉原因：主要是领导问题，指导运动是从自己主观思想上出发，没注意贫雇要求，犯了包办代替毛病，工作方针步骤也不够明确。又讨论了今后的作法，贫雇王富存说：“咱们的力量小，还有好多贫雇没有吸收进来，咱们的队伍需要很快扩大。”提出了开门站岗，扩大队伍。经解决了以上问题，贫雇由七十三名增加到九十三名，于二十四号正式成立了贫农团。　　（立民、永孝等）
