　　【Xingtai City News】The Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce, in order to better resolve future labor-capital relations, wage issues, and the handling of fugitive businesses, held small meetings of managers, workers, and shop assistants in various commercial streets. After several days of deliberation and information gathering, a city-wide conference of managers, shop assistants, and workers was convened on the 12th of this month. The director of the Administration of Industry and Commerce first reviewed that in the past, wage standards were not based on technical skill and work enthusiasm, but were divided into three grades and nine levels according to the size of the business and the seniority of the shop assistants. This lost the positive significance of improving skills and rewarding production. He then proposed that in the future, the issue of wages must be resolved by guaranteeing the minimum living requirements of workers and shop assistants, ensuring profitability for the capitalists, and implementing the principle of "benefit for both labor and capital" with the mutual consent of both parties. He also put forward three points regarding correct labor-capital relations in the future: (1) Workers and shop assistants should actively engage in production, improve their skills, study their business, and develop industry and commerce. (2) Managers should lead the business well, expand production, promote democracy, rationally divide labor, and be actively responsible. (3) Workers and shop assistants should abide by the business leadership of the managers, and the managers should also respect the personality (no beating or scolding) and correct opinions of the workers and shop assistants, truly achieving mutual respect and joint efforts to develop production.

　　Secondly, regarding the handling of fugitive businesses, he succinctly put forward the following measures: (1) If the shareholders of the fugitive business have family members at home, the ownership of the business should be returned to the original owner and the shareholder relationship restored, and business should be continued. (2) If the shareholders of the fugitive business have no family members at home, the government will temporarily entrust a special person to be responsible for management and operation on behalf of the owner. The government has the right to inspect its business operations and provide guidance. After the original owner returns, everything will be returned to the owner. (3) For fugitive businesses of shopkeepers managed by streets and villages, the government will order the cessation of all expenses within the business by the respective streets and villages, and the government will entrust a special person to continue operations, returning it to the original owner upon their return. (4) Stop village cadres from casually borrowing from fugitive businesses, and recover any outstanding loans. Prohibit extravagant eating and drinking and wasteful phenomena, and those who engage in such phenomena again will be handed over to the government for processing. (5) For workers, shop assistants, and managers who do not understand the policies, fear struggle, and are of landlord or rich peasant background, who have fled to the Kuomintang-controlled areas because their families were struggled against, they are all welcome to return to engage in industry and commerce. The government will protect their human rights and property rights and help them develop industrial and commercial production.

　　邢市保护私人工商业
  　逃亡商号归还原主
    【邢台市消息】市工商管理局为了更好解决今后劳资关系、工资问题及逃亡商号处理问题等，在各商业街分别开经理及工人店员小型会议，经过几天酝酿和了解情况后，在本月十二日又召开全市经理、店员、工人大会，工商局长首先检讨过去订工资标准不是按技术高低与工作积极为标准，而是以商号大小及店员年代长短分为三等九级，这是失掉提高技术与奖励生产的积极意义的。接着提出：今后必须在保证工人店员最低生活要求与保证资方有利可图，贯彻“劳资两利”与双方自愿的原则下，来解决工资问题。并对今后正确劳资关系提出三点：（一）工人店员应积极生产，提高技术，研究业务，发展工商业。（二）经理应好好领导业务扩大生产，发扬民主，合理分工，积极负责。（三）工人店员要遵守经理业务领导，经理也要尊重工人店员人格（不打骂）与正确意见，真正做到双方互相尊重，共同努力发展生产。
    其次，关于逃亡商号处理问题，他扼要提出如下办法：（一）逃亡商号股东如家中有人者，商号所有权应归原主与恢复股东关系，并继续经营。（二）逃亡商号股东家中无人者，暂由政府委托专人负责代管经营，政府有检查其经营情况，及加以指导之权。待原主回来后，全部归还本人。（三）街村代管之店主逃亡商号，由政府下令停止各街村在该号内一切开支，并由政府委托专人继续经营，待其原主回来后归还其本人。（四）停止乡村干部在逃亡商号内随便借贷，并追回其未归还之借款。禁止大吃大喝浪费现象，如再有此现象者，即送政府处理。（五）对于不了解政策，害怕斗争及地主富农成份工人店员经理，因家中被斗而逃往蒋管区者，一律欢迎回来经营工商业，政府对其人权财权予以保护，并帮助其发展工商生产。
