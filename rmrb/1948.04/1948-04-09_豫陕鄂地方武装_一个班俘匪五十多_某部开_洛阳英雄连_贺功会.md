Xinhua News Agency, Yu, Shaanxi, and E Front, 7th. A squad of local armed forces in the Third Sub-district bravely pursued bandits and combined this with political appeals during bandit suppression, capturing 54 bandits in one instance, and were gloriously commended and rewarded. In early March, the squad set out to suppress bandits in the areas of Yiyang, Lushan, and Songxian counties, and set a plan to capture 20 bandits. They then discovered over 200 bandits in the Huangzhuang area. Led by the squad leader and deputy squad leader, the squad chased them over seven mountains and seven large gullies, preventing the bandits from having any chance to return fire or catch their breath. During the pursuit, the squad also shouted appeals, and finally, with the cooperation of fraternal units, annihilated the entire band of bandits. The entire squad captured 54 bandits and killed or wounded seven, exceeding the plan by two times. Furthermore, a unit of our local armed forces, on the 21st of last month, surrounded and annihilated the local Chiang Kai-shek element Xu Guangwu's unit, which was lurking around Guangwu Township. They captured more than ten people, including the puppet township chief Xu Guangwu, and seized two light machine guns, one grenade launcher, eighteen long guns, 1,720 rounds of ammunition, and four mules. We suffered no casualties.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu, Shaanxi, and E Front, 7th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army recently held a celebration meeting to congratulate the Luoyang Hero Company. County Chief Wei of a certain county in the garrison area also went to participate with militiamen and mass representatives carrying pigs and sheep. The most eye-catching figure at the meeting was Wang Yinsheng, the combat hero who established the first merit for the company. At that time, he was the seventh squad leader. When our assault troops were blocked at the city wall, he led the entire squad to break into the first city without waiting for orders from his superiors and held the position surrounded by enemy fire from all sides, defeating the superior enemy and enabling the follow-up troops to successfully break into the second city wall. He has now been promoted to deputy platoon leader, and the seventh squad he used to lead has been named the Luoyang Hero Squad. Xu Zhixin, a health worker who was awarded a special merit, closely followed the troops in the assault into the city. Despite suffering several injuries, he still struggled to bandage more than a dozen wounded soldiers in the mud before bandaging his own wounds. He then continued to rush into the second city with the troops. The company commander advised him to leave the front line, but he refused. Finally, he was ordered to escort the prisoners back to the rear, but after delivering them, he returned to the front line and continued to persevere for two days before finally going for medical treatment. At the meeting, County Chief Wei, on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of people in the county, paid tribute to the troops who liberated Luoyang. An Tingkou, the company commander of the Luoyang Hero Company, expressed the determination of the entire company to the assembly, to better learn military skills and deeply conduct the Three Check-Ups Movement, and to establish greater merits in future battles, maintaining the glorious title of "Luoyang Hero Company" until the day all the Chiang bandits are eliminated.
