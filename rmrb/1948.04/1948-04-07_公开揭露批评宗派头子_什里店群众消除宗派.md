　　Publicly Exposing and Criticizing Sect Leaders
  　Shi Li Dian Masses Eliminate Sectarianism
    [Report from this newspaper] The masses of Shi Li Dian in the ninth district of Wu'an, in the process of reorganizing their ranks, have gradually overcome the sectarian phenomena of some people and are becoming more united.
    In the past, sectarianism in this village was quite serious. The most significant sectarian opposition was between Zhaishang (Upper Village) and Xiajie (Lower Street). In the past, they fought fiercely, often engaging in brawls. After the establishment of the democratic government, things improved somewhat, but the problem was not eliminated. Last winter, when “digging air-raid shelters,” the digging stopped temporarily when it reached Upper Street due to an order from above. Some people in Lower Street suspected that "the district cadres were favoring Upper Street." People in Upper Street then complained that "the district cadres only stay in Lower Street when they come." At the beginning of this reorganization, when the whole village's poor peasants were electing initiators for the Poor Peasants' League, there was another round of "two garlic cloves" division. During the initial class determination, some people in Lower Street said: "The people in Zhaishang are really holding tight to each other, even Fu ××, who feeds mules, is still said to be a poor peasant." When giving opinions to the village cadres, some people in Zhaishang said: "How come the main cadres are all in 'Wang Ban Jie' (southern end of Lower Street)?" Some even clamored for "settling accounts! Dividing the village!" When electing members of the Farmers' Association, someone in Lower Street grumbled behind their back: "Don't elect any lads from Zhaishang!"... There was also disunity between the Fu and Li surnames in Zhaishang. The Lis cursed: "There isn't a single decent person in the Fu family!" The Fus also cursed the Lis for their shortcomings. There were also conflicts between the north and south ends of Lower Street. When evaluating potholes for filling, a group of people in the south end of the street formed cliques and colluded with each other. People from other streets said: "The people in the south end are really overbearing. They call everything a pothole, even if it isn't, and they push and pull until it's evaluated as one." Some people also said that this group of people in the south end had a "secret code" when they spoke. In addition, the former cadre Wang Kebin and a group of "activists" he manipulated were also a serious problem. They formed a small sect, creating conflicts with the cadres and bullying the masses. Another small sect leader, Wang ××, gathered a group of people to carry out retaliatory and vindictive activities, and even wanted to seize power and position in this movement.
    After the work team arrived in the village, they discovered the existence of sectarianism from the tone of the masses' conversations. During the movement, several other small sects were gradually exposed. Initially, some comrades in the work team said: "We see that the existence of sectarianism is bad, but it is not appropriate to publicly expose it, as it is tantamount to legalizing sectarianism." They were afraid to face the issue directly. In fact, publicly exposing it is precisely declaring sectarianism illegal. Other comrades believed: "We must recognize the seriousness of this problem; without first resolving the sectarian problem, the work cannot proceed normally." This is again looking at the problem in isolation; in fact, the more we isolate, statically, and separately resolve the sectarian problem, the more the masses will get entangled in this issue and be unable to move forward.
    After the sectarianism between Zhaishang and Xiajie was exposed at the meeting to elect initiators for the Poor Peasants' League, the work team conducted a preliminary resolution of this issue. Because the people in Upper Street were particularly emotional, a special "turning point" meeting was convened for them. First, some people with particularly strong sectarian sentiments were allowed to fully vent their grievances. Then, they were persuaded on the basis of the ideas they had exposed, strengthening the class education of the poor and hired peasants, explaining that disunity would lead to losses, and emphasizing that only unity was allowed, and division was not allowed. At the same time, a small number of people who liked to engage in sectarianism were criticized, freeing the masses from their influence, and making everyone realize that only a few people in Lower Street were bad. The few people in Lower Street with strong sectarian sentiments were also educated that day. After easing the temporary excitement, the work team no longer lingered on this issue, but guided the masses' thoughts to the democratic movement and the reorganization of the ranks. Through the organizations of the Poor Peasants' League and the Farmers' Association, everyone was united into a whole. When developing league and association members, the masses would not allow people who liked to form small cliques and incite unprincipled disputes to join, but required them to correct their behavior before being accepted. The conditions for league members, association members, and committee members, as well as the rules established, all included the item "do not form small cliques." In the democratic movement, everyone offered opinions to the bad cadres, had a common goal, and proved in action that they were one family, which eliminated some people's prejudices and made them more united.
    Regarding sectarianism between surnames, the main focus was also on resolving it through ideological education and organizational guarantees. Everyone was to recognize that regardless of whether they were surnamed Wang, Fu, or Li, everyone had a common surname: Labor.
    For all small sects, first investigate who the main instigator is and who the followers are; individually educate the followers and advise them to leave the small cliques; this will dismantle the sects from the side. If this doesn't work, then publicly expose the sect leaders at the appropriate occasion and time. When evaluating the households with potholes, a group of people acted like hooligans, engaging in verbal fights with others and even threatening to leave the meeting. Afterwards, the work team, together with the chairman of the Poor Peasants' League, made a strict criticism of this person; it also made the Poor Peasants' League pay attention to enforcing democratic discipline and preventing a small number of people from undermining the rules established by everyone. On another occasion, a group of former "activists" manipulated the meeting, and they were also exposed among the masses. The masses were very satisfied with this: "In the past, only those few people spoke at the meeting; before we could finish a sentence, they would speak again and suppress our words. Now, it really is the honest peasants who are in charge."
    At the same time, the branch also educated the Party members in the Party rectification: not only should they not blindly engage in sectarianism against the people, but they should also not participate in any sectarian activities.
    The branch educates Party members to jump out of the sectarian circle
    Some sects have a long history, natural conditions, and are blindly motivated; the masses themselves know it is bad, but sometimes they can't help but reveal it again. Completely eliminating sectarianism cannot be done in a day or two, and it is necessary to constantly pay attention to overcoming it ideologically and organizationally. It is necessary to use concrete examples to educate everyone on the harm of sectarianism; it is not easy to achieve results by just talking about vague general principles.
    Up to now, judging from the actions of offering opinions to Party members and cadres, electing village committee members, and discussing issues at the farmers' representative conference, the phenomenon of sectarianism between Upper and Lower Streets is rarely seen; a number of small sect leaders have also failed to achieve their personal goals and have instead exposed themselves in front of the masses.
    The Shi Li Dian work team has learned from their experience that there are several points that work team members need to pay attention to when resolving sectarian problems among the masses: (1) On matters of principle, there must be no compromise; one cannot concede to incorrect opinions for the sake of superficial "unity," nor can one allow the masses to give up mutual criticism for the sake of superficial "unity." For example, when electing initiators for the Poor Peasants' League, someone from Lower Street pointed out the shortcomings of several people nominated by Zhaishang, and someone from Zhaishang said: "These are the only good people in our Zhaishang!" In fact, the people nominated by Zhaishang did have relatively large problems. The attitude of Lower Street in making criticisms contained sectarian sentiments, which was wrong, but the criticism was still correct. At the time, some comrades advocated: "It is best for each street to criticize its own people, and it is not advisable for Upper and Lower Streets to criticize each other." This is incorrect. (2) Work team members themselves must never be contaminated by the sectarian sentiments of the masses. At the time, some comrades working in Lower Street complained: "There may be problems with the work in Zhaishang!" Some comrades working in Zhaishang also believed: "It is the people in Lower Street who are actively engaged in sectarianism. Upper Street is a small village and is being bullied." When the masses in Zhaishang were complaining at the meal market, one comrade even took a notebook to record the words of the masses, which only further fueled sectarianism. (3) When it is necessary to publicly expose and criticize a small number of people who like to engage in sectarianism, it must be done, as this is in line with the demands of the masses and does not constitute paternalism. Letting it go without saying anything will only lead to detachment from the masses.

　　公开揭露批评宗派头子
  　什里店群众消除宗派
    【本报消息】武安九区什里店群众在整编队伍过程中，逐渐克服了一部分人闹宗派的现象，日趋团结。
    这个村子里闹宗派的现象过去相当严重。最显著的大宗派是寨上和下街的对立。过去闹得很凶，动不动就打架。有了民主政府以后比较好些，但没有消灭了。去冬“挖防空洞”，挖到上街时接到上边命令叫暂时停止，下街就有人怀疑“区干部袒护上街”；上街的人则又埋怨“区干部一来就只住在下街。”这次整编队伍之初，全村贫农选举贫农团发起人的时候，又闹了一回“两瓣子蒜”。在初划阶级时，下街有人说：“人家寨上圪＠抱的真紧，傅××喂着骡子，还都说是贫农。”在给村干部提意见时，寨上有人又说：“大干部怎么就都在‘王半街’（下街南头）？”甚至有人叫嚣“算帐！分村！”选农会委员时，下街又有一个人背地咕哝：“不选寨上的小子！”……寨上傅、李两姓之间也不团结，姓李的骂：“傅家就没一个正派人！”姓傅的也骂李家的人怎么不好。下街南北两头也有予盾，评窟窿准备填补时，南头有一伙伙人抱圪＠互相拉拢，别的街就有人说：“南头的人真横，该窟窿说是窟窿，不是窟窿也都说是，一推一拉就评议过去了。”还有人说南头这一伙人说话都定的有“暗号”。另外，比较严重的，还有旧干部王克斌和他操纵的一批“积极分子”，也结成个小宗派，跟干部闹矛盾，对群众耍厉害。还有个小宗派头子王××，拉拢了一伙人，进行报复和打击别人的活动，还想在这次运动中争权夺位。
    工作组到村后，就从群众谈话的语气之间发现了宗派的存在，在运动过程中，陆续又有几个小宗派暴露了出来。最初工作组有的同志说：“咱看到了宗派的存在是不好的，可是公开揭露了不合适，等于承认宗派合法。”害怕正视这个问题。其实，公开揭露正是宣布宗派的不合法。又有的同志认为：“要认识这问题的严重性；不先解决宗派问题，工作就没法正常进行下去。”这又是孤立的看问题；其实，越是孤立的静止的单独解决宗派问题，群众就越会纠缠在这问题上，不能前进一步。
    在选举贫农团发起人的会上暴露了寨上跟下街的宗派之后，工作组就对这个问题进行初步解决。因上街的人情绪特别激动，就召集他们特别开了个“转湾子”会，先让一些宗派情绪特别浓重的人发透牢骚，然后就针对他们暴露出来的思想进行说服，加强对贫雇群众的阶级教育，说明不团结要吃亏，强调只许讲团结，不许闹分裂。同时对爱闹宗派的少数人进行了批评，使群众从他们影响下解脱出来，要大家认识下街也只是少数人不好。对下街的少数几个宗派情绪浓重的人，当天也找他们进行了教育。缓和了一时激动的情绪之后，就不再停留在这问题上，而引导群众思想到民主运动和整编队伍上。通过贫农团、农会的组织，把大家结成一个整体。在发展团员、会员时，群众就不让爱抱小圪＠爱鼓动无原则纠纷的人进来，要他们改正了才吸收。在团员、会员、委员的条件上和定的规矩里面，都有“不抱小圪＠”这一条。在民主运动中，大家都向坏干部提意见，有了共同的目标，在行动中证明大家是一家人，就消除了一些人的偏见，更趋团结。
    对于姓氏之间的宗派，主要也是从思想教育和组织保证两方面注意解决。要大家认识：不管姓王姓傅姓李，大家有一个共同的姓：劳动。
    对于一切小宗派，先调查其中谁是主要的，谁是附和的；对附和的人个别进行教育，劝告他们离开小圪＠；这样从旁拆散宗派。再不行的话，就在适当场合适当时机对宗派头子加以公开揭露。在评窟窿户时，有一伙人耍流氓作风，和别人打嘴仗后还又以退出会场吓唬人。以后工作组就会同贫农团主席对这个人作了严格的批评；也使贫农团注意执行民主纪律，制止少数人破坏大家定下的规矩。又有一次，一伙旧“积极分子”操纵会场，也在群众中揭露了他们。群众对于这样做很满意：“过去在会上光有那几个人说的；咱一句话没说完人家就又说，就把咱的话压住说不出来了。现在可真是要咱老实农民当家了。”
    同时，支部在整党中也教育了党员：不但不要一窝蜂对人民闹宗派，也不参加任何宗派活动。
    支部教育党员跳出宗派圈子
    有些宗派有长期的历史、自然的条件，带着盲目性；群众自己也知道不好，可是有时候不由得就又流露了出来。彻底清除宗派不是一两天可以做好的，必需从思想上、组织上经常注意克服。要拿具体的例子教育大家认识宗派的害处，只讲空泛的大道理不容易奏效。
    到现在，从给党员干部提意见、选举村政委员、农代会讨论问题等行动中看，上下街闹宗派的现象已很少见；一些小宗派头子，也都没达到他们的私人目的，反而在群众面前暴露了他们自己。
    什里店工作组就他们的经验体会到：工作员本身在解决群众中的宗派问题时有几点需要注意：（一）对原则问题不能让步，不能为了表面的“团结”而迁就不正确的意见，也不能为了表面的“团结”而让群众放弃相互批评。如在选举贫农团发起人时，下街有人提出寨上提的几个人的缺点，寨上就有人说：“俺寨上就是这几个人好！”其实寨上提的几个人毛病确是比较大的。下街提出批评的态度含着宗派情绪，是不对的，但批评还是对的。当时有的同志主张：“最好本街批评本街的人，不要上下街互相批评为妙。”这是不正确的。（二）工作员自己万不可沾染上群众的宗派情绪。当时，在下街工作的同志有人埋怨：“寨上的工作恐怕有问题！”寨上工作的同志也有人认为：“主动闹宗派的是下街的人，上街是小村，受欺负了。”寨上群众在饭市发牢骚时，还有一位同志拿着本子去记群众的话，这只有更助长宗派。（三）对少数爱闹宗派的人，该公开揭露、批评时一定要揭露、批评，这是合乎群众的要求的，不算包办代替。放任不吭，反而会脱离群众。
