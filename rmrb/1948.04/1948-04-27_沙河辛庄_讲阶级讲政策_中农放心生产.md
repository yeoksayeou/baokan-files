    Xin Zhuang Village, Shahe
    Emphasizing Class and Policy, Middle Peasants Can Confidently Produce
    [Shahe News] In Xin Zhuang Village, Second District, when the Poor Peasants' League was established last year, the interests of the middle peasants were severely violated. Approximately 400,000 yuan worth of property was "mobilized" from the middle peasants, leading to the isolation of the poor peasants and panic among the middle peasants, who lost the will to produce. After attending a meeting in the district, the cadres resisted ideologically and refused to act, saying, "The higher-ups are calling for democracy; organizing the masses is simply giving orders." They adopted an attitude of ignoring the masses. Women reported that production was unattended to and the spinning cooperative had closed its doors.
    This caused production to drift freely throughout the village. The work team convened a mass meeting, emphasizing class and policy, and then held discussion meetings. Several poor peasants said, "Middle peasants work for themselves and should not be struggled against. Even if someone only eats and doesn't work, they can't become a middle peasant. Last year, we didn't even dare to speak to the middle peasants, because they said we were trying to shield things for them. Heavens! Even family members didn't dare to talk to each other." Peng Xianji, a representative of the middle peasants, said, "I am a hard worker. When making bricks, people often say 'three meals early and late, five hundred bricks morning and night,' but I can make a thousand a day. Last year, the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League mobilized tens of thousands of yuan from me, and I was very scared. I waited for a month and didn't dare to work. If I plowed leaving one-third fallow, and the pig got fat, it would be slaughtered. How could I dare to develop production? I quickly wanted to be classified as a poor peasant to feel safe. Now I understand." Following the discussion, it was decided that the mobilized items would be returned or appropriately compensated. The cadres also admitted their mistakes and made self-criticisms, resolving to lead production. The production enthusiasm of the masses was greatly increased. They are now busy hoeing the wheat for the second time, and the cooperative is also operating again. (Er Xin, Wang Kuan, Xu Ke)

    沙河辛庄
    讲阶级讲政策
    中农放心生产
    【沙河消息】二区辛庄村，去年成立贫农团时，严重的违犯了中农利益，“动员”了中农约值四十万元的财物，致使贫农孤立，中农恐慌，没心生产。干部在区开会回来，思想上抵抗躺倒不动，说：“上级叫民主哩，组织群众就是命令。”采取对群众不管态度。妇女反映说：生产没人管了，纺花合作社也闭了门。
    这样使全村生产自流，工作组召集群众大会，讲阶级讲政策，继又开座谈会进行讨论，有几个贫农说：“中农都是自己劳动的，就不该斗争，光吃不干也成不了中农。去年咱见了中农连句话也不敢说，说句话就说想给人家包庇东西哩，老天爷！一家人也不敢说话了。”中农代表彭贤吉说：“我是个好受家，打坯，人家常说‘迟早三顿饭，早晚五百坯’，我一天能打一千。去年成立贫农团动员了我几万元，我可害怕哩，等了一个月没敢做活，耕二余一哩，猪胖了就要杀哩，怎敢发展，赶快落成贫农就放心了，这次可明白了。”接着讨论出动员的东西，一定退还或适当补偿，干部也认错，并作检讨，决心领导生产，群众生产情绪大大提高，现在正赶锄二遍麦子，合作社也干开了。（二心、王宽、许科）
