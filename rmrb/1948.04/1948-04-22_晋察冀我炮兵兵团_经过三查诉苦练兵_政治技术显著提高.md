　　Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region Our Artillery Corps
    Significant Improvements in Politics and Technology After Three Checks, Complaining, and Military Training
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 20th] The heroic artillery corps of the People's Liberation Army, after three checks, complaining, and military training, has seen an unprecedented surge in the spirit of revenge warfare, a significant strengthening of cadres' sense of responsibility, and a notable improvement in technology. During the northern expedition, an artillery unit camped under the Little Wutai Mountains amidst swirling snowflakes. The entire third platoon of a certain unit took off their clothes and crossed the 200-meter-wide Sanggan River ice flow in the cold dawn wind. Artillery advancing to Yangyuan transported shells, crossing the Sanggan River twenty-four times in six hours. Many soldiers' legs turned purple and were cut by ice, but they did not complain. A certain artillery unit meticulously planned to pull heavy artillery over the steep mountains and twenty-mile-long narrow valleys that even ordinary donkeys struggled to climb. In order to reach the front line in time for battle, a certain artillery unit advancing to Guangling marched ninety miles on rugged roads, finally running three miles to enter the position and participate in the battle. Cadres played a leading role in many situations. Cadres at the battalion level of a certain regiment only rode their animals for twenty miles in a month, and battalion and company cadres often carried the soldiers' guns and belongings. In the Chahar-South campaign, a certain artillery unit accurately fired at the enemy in coordination with the infantry, all the field artillery shells hitting their targets, and the effect of the mortar's deep firing was also greatly improved compared to before. When the people of Chahar-South saw the cannons of a certain unit, they happily shouted, "Our artillery team is back!" Many villagers gathered around, stroking the brand-new cannon bodies, and asked the soldiers to accurately fire at the enemy to avenge them.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th] Zhou Hengnong, a hero of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, has been promoted to company commander of the fourth company of a certain battalion due to his excellent military and political skills and repeated meritorious deeds. After Zhou Hengnong killed He Shixiong, the deputy commander of the 195th Division of the enemy, in the second battle to defend Linjiang, and achieved a surprising victory in the liberation of Huidian, he was awarded the title of hero at the first celebration conference of a certain column, and was credited with a special merit. At the same time, the second squad of the fourth company was also awarded the title of "Zhou Hengnong Squad". Since then, Zhou has always maintained his excellent combat style and has been active and responsible in his work. During last year's autumn offensive to annihilate the 116th Division of the enemy, the squad pursued and won, and was commended by the division. In the past year, Zhou Hengnong's squad has killed or captured 196 enemies, seized two 60mm mortars, ten light machine guns, eleven submachine guns, fifty-one rifles and pistols, twenty-four war horses, and many other military supplies, enough to equip a company. Later, Zhou Hengnong was appointed as a platoon leader. Under his patient education, the platoon was very united, and there were no non-combat attrition incidents for seven months. During the winter offensive, the troops moved and fought for days in the snow and ice, and the platoon's combat morale was always full. Zhou Hengnong also carried out evaluations of marching, researched experiences, and constantly carried out combat mobilization during the gaps in the march. Before each battle, the platoon always requested arduous tasks and was able to complete them in battle. Zhou Hengnong is usually humble and amiable, without any arrogance or complacency. He is always humble and sincere to his superiors, patient and calm to his subordinates, and rarely loses his temper. He adopts patient education for individual soldiers with shortcomings to gradually transform them. After the winter offensive, Zhou was promoted to deputy instructor of the fourth company and still lived with the soldiers every day.

　　晋察冀我炮兵兵团
    经过三查诉苦练兵  政治技术显著提高
    【新华社晋察冀前线二十日电】解放军英勇的炮兵兵团，经过三查诉苦及练兵后，复仇作战情绪空前高涨，干部责任心大大加强，技术也显著提高。北征途中，炮兵某部在雪花纷飞中露营小五台山下，某部三排全体战士，脱下衣服，在拂晓寒风中，渡过二百米宽的桑乾河冰流。挺进阳原的炮兵为搬运炮弹，在六小时内来回过桑乾河二十四次，许多战士的腿都冻紫，被冰块扎出了血，但毫无怨言。某部炮兵并精心计划，将重炮拉过普通毛驴也难上的峻岭与二十里长的狭谷。为及时赶赴前线作战，挺进广灵的某炮兵在崎岖的道路上急行军九十里，最后跑步三里，进入阵地，参加战斗。干部们在许多情况下起了带头作用，某团营干部一个月只骑过二十里路牲口，营连干部身上经常背着战士们的枪和东西。在察南作战中某部炮兵配合步兵准确的向敌人射击，野炮弹全数命中，迫击炮纵深射击效果也比前大为提高。察南人民见到我某部的大炮，高兴的喊着：“咱们的炮队回来了。”许多老乡围拢来抚摸着崭新的炮身，要求战士们准确的射击敌人替他们报仇。
    【新华社东北二十日电】解放军某部英雄周恒农，因军政兼优屡立战功，刻已被提升为某营四连连长。周恒农在第二次保卫临江战斗中击毙敌一九五师副师长何世雄与解放辉南战斗出奇致胜后，于某纵队首届庆功大会上，即荣获英雄称号，并记特功一次，同时四连二班亦被授以“周恒农班”称号。以后周始终保持其优良战斗作风，工作上亦积极负责。去年秋季攻势歼敌一一六师战斗时，该班追击获胜，荣获师的通令表扬。总计过去一年中，周恒农班毙俘敌一九六名、缴获六零炮二门、轻机枪十挺、冲锋枪十一支、长短枪五十一支，战马二十四匹及其他军用品甚多，可装备一个连。以后周恒农被任为排长，该排在他耐心教育下，内部十分团结，整整七个月没有非战斗减员现象。冬季攻势中，部队在冰天雪地里连日运动作战，该排战斗情绪始终饱满，周恒农并在行军空隙开展评行军、研究经验，不断进行作战动员，每次战斗前该排总是要求艰巨任务，且在战斗中均能完成任务。周恒农平时态度谦虚和蔼，毫无高傲自满，对上级一贯虚心诚恳，对下级耐心冷静，很少发脾气，对个别有缺点的战士采取耐心教育，使其逐渐改造。冬季攻势后周被升任四连副指导员，每天仍和战士一起生活。
