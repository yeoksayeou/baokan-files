    Comrade Xiushan: The question you raised has been sent to the Wei County government. Please have them reply directly.
    Comrade Yan Dengrui: Regarding the issue of the Great Military Region Guard Regiment occupying the temple land on your street and rebuilding it into houses, if the street cadres are unclear about it, please ask the district cadres to assist in handling it.
    Comrade Dezong of Pengcheng Zhangbin Stone Printing Factory: Although the filled land of urban residents is in the countryside, it should still belong to the original owner and should not be taken out for equal distribution.
    Huang Fenglin: The issue you raised about the Su household in Tianyang鄄 Village, Sixth District of Wu'an, having land in some villages in the Fifth District, should be submitted to the local work team to assist the poor peasant association and the new peasant association in handling it during the filling process. In special circumstances, dividing land in both places is also allowed, as long as it is not dividing double shares in both places.
    Comrade Zhang Chengguo: The problem you reported of Ma Village, Seventh District of Wei County, confiscating grain from middle peasants with different surnames has been sent to the Wei County government for inspection and handling.
    Wu'an Civil Affairs Section: 1. Regarding the marriage issue of Zhao Ergui in Shaluo Village, divorce should generally not be considered based solely on appearance. 2. The Cui Yuzhu issue can be handled in accordance with the Border Region Marriage Regulations.
    Comrade Ren County Zhenxi: 1. Regarding the two women you mentioned who are willing to take care of a child and live their lives, if they are truly willing, they can handle it themselves. 2. Since the couple is not in harmony and it is delaying production, if both parties are willing, they can divorce.
    Comrade Zhiping: The issue of poor peasants in the Wu'an street turmoil must be resolutely compensated, but it must be handled uniformly when there is a work team in charge of leadership; currently, those who are having difficulty surviving the spring famine or have difficulties in spring farming production should first find ways to provide relief and arrangements.
