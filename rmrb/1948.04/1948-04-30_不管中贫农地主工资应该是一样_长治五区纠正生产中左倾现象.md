    Regardless of Middle Peasants, Poor Peasants, or Landlords, Wages Should Be the Same
    Changzhi Fifth District Corrects Left-Leaning Phenomena in Production
    [Changzhi News] The Fifth District convened an enlarged cadre meeting on the 19th of this month to review the first month of spring plowing. Through reports from various base points and self-examination by cadres, three major problems were discovered in spring plowing production: (1) Different wage rates for each class. For example, the chairman of the Xizhang Farmers' Association said: "The masses in our village have researched that middle peasants have more labor, and poor peasants have less labor. To take care of the difficulties of the poor (no wages were given to landlords last year), this year's wage rates are set at one and a half *sheng* of rice for landlords, half a *sheng* for middle peasants, and two *sheng* for poor peasants." (2) Arbitrary infringement on middle peasants. Qujiashan Village made middle peasants contribute more than 20 *mu* of land to offset public grain. Gouli Village added more than 40 *shi* of public grain to middle peasants, so a small number of middle peasant households now have nothing to eat. (3) No loans were given to middle peasants. For example, Xiping loaned money to "washed face and wiped black" middle peasants, and the district cadre ordered the branch secretary to take it back, saying that the class of the loan committee was not clear. After repeated discussions, everyone realized that the past practices were contrary to the Party's policy and detrimental to the masses. For example, the Yaotong branch secretary said: "We are not looking at the watermelon, but only at the sesame seeds. Not giving wages to landlords is not what the masses demand. Last year, honest farmers secretly gave grain to landlords, and we even asked them what their thoughts were, which is to become separated from the masses." After reversing the left-leaning emotions, everyone came up with four regulations: (1) While satisfying the demands of the poor and hired peasants in loaning grain and money, the difficulties of the middle peasants must be resolved. (2) Middle peasants are not allowed to be excluded in terms of burdens and cooperative dividends. (3) Landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants must have the same wages, and it is not allowed to suppress production enthusiasm. (4) Landlords must be resettled, and no one is allowed to starve to death. Then, everyone was inspired to actively discuss spring plowing and formulate a concrete spring plowing plan.

    不管中贫农地主工资应该是一样
    长治五区纠正生产中左倾现象
    【长治消息】五区在本月十九号召开全区扩干会议，检查一月春耕。经各基点汇报与干部自我检查，发现春耕生产中有三个大问题：（一）各阶层工资不一样。如西掌农会主席说：“我村群众研究，中农劳力多，贫农劳力少，为照顾穷人的困难（去年没给地主工资），今年订工资是地主一工半升米、中农升半米、贫农二升米。（二）任意侵害中农。屈家山村让中农拿出二十多亩地顶公粮。沟里村给中农加公粮四十多石，所以中农有少数户口现在没吃的。（三）不给中农贷款。如西坪贷给洗脸擦黑中农款，区干部让支书收回来，并说贷款委员会阶级不明确。大家反复讨论，一致认识过去作法与党的政策相反，与群众不利。如窑同支书说：“咱们不看西瓜光看芝麻，不给地主工资不是群众要求。去年老实农民偷给地主粮食，咱们还问人家啥思想，脱离群众。扭转左倾情绪后，大家研究出四项规定：（一）在贷粮款中满足贫雇要求，必须解决中农困难。（二）在负担上与合作社分红上不准排斥中农。（三）工资上地主富农中贫农必须一样，不准打击生产情绪。（四）必须安置地主，不准饿死一个人。接着启发大家积极讨论春耕，订出春耕具体计划。（振华、五区春耕工作组）
