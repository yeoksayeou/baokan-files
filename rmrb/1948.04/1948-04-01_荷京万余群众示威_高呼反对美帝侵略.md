　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Reports from various sources: The shameless behavior of the reactionary governments of the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and other countries, in launching large-scale attacks on domestic democratic forces due to their acceptance of the "Marshall Plan," has aroused the righteous indignation of the people of these countries. According to a TASS dispatch on the 25th: The wave of Dutch people opposing the government's submission to Wall Street has swept the country. Twelve thousand people in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, held a demonstration, chanting slogans against U.S. imperialist interference in Dutch internal affairs. The General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, De Groot, delivered a speech at a mass meeting, angrily denouncing the Dutch reactionaries for attempting to rebuild fascist rule in the country in accordance with Wall Street's orders. De Groot emphasized: "But the working people will never allow the reactionaries to win." Workers in many factories in Amsterdam have gone on strike, and crowds of workers have gathered in the streets to protest the government's reactionary policies. Three thousand Swedish workers held a protest meeting in Stockholm on the 22nd. The leader of the Swedish Communist Party, Lindruth, delivered a speech, pointing out that the Randel (Social Democratic Party) government's participation in the "Marshall Plan" has brought serious harm to the Swedish nation. He strongly criticized the arrogant anti-communist movement launched by the Swedish reactionaries, which is attempting to divert the attention of the workers and trying to hide the essence of the "Marshall Plan" from the people. According to a public opinion survey in Denmark, among the people who were consulted to approve or disapprove of the "Marshall Plan," 55 percent expressed indifference and sarcasm with no response, and 23 percent directly stated that the plan was harmful and unprofitable to Denmark. The Danish newspaper "Berlingske" Evening News wrote: "The demon of unemployment closely follows the Marshall Plan." The newspaper cited Belgium as an example, where the number of unemployed will soon reach one million, with one in eight people unemployed.

　　荷京万余群众示威
    高呼反对美帝侵略
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】各方讯：荷、瑞、丹等国反动政府，因接受“马歇尔计划”而向本国民主力量大举进攻的无耻行为，已激起各该国人民的义愤。据塔斯社二十五日电称：荷兰人民反对政府向华尔街屈膝的浪潮，已遍及全国。荷京阿姆斯特丹一万二千人举行示威，高呼反对美帝干涉荷兰内政。荷共总书记德格鲁特在群众大会上发表演说怒斥荷兰反动派遵照华尔街的命令，企图在国内重建法西斯统治。德氏强调说：“但是劳动人民决不允许反动派取得胜利。”阿姆斯特丹很多工厂的工人，已举行罢工，工人群集街头，抗议政府反动政策。瑞典三千工人二十二日在斯托哥尔姆举行抗议大会。瑞共领袖林德鲁特发表演说，指出兰德尔（社会民主党）政府的参加“马歇尔计划”，给瑞典国家带来严重的危害。他力斥瑞典反动派所发动的狂妄的反共运动，是在妄图转移工人的视线，竭力向人民掩藏“马歇尔计划的实质”。据丹麦民意调查所统计，被征询以赞成或反对“马歇尔计划”的人民中，百分之五十五以不答复表示冷淡与讽刺，百分之二十三正面表示该计划对丹有害无利。丹报“贝林斯克”晚报撰文指出：“失业的妖魔紧随着歇尔计划”。该报以比利时为例，比最近失业人数将达一百万，八人中间就有一人失业。
