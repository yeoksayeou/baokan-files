Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th: Anshan's public enterprises have seen significant development in the past six months. The Anshan Textile Factory, which had only 12 spinning machines and 4,800 spindles during the seven and a half months of Chiang Kai-shek's rule, now has 33 spinning machines, 39,620 spindles, and 252 looms after six months of our recovery. The Electric Power Bureau restored power supply the day after Anshan was liberated. In the past six months, the power supply has increased by one and a half times compared to the Chiang Kai-shek period, with an increase of 4,726 electric lights, 5,497 street lights, and 556 kilowatts of electric heating, along with 264 additional power machines. The Anshan Paper Mill only had two factories during Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Except for the Liuhe Paper Mill, which had one small machine operating, the other factories were not operating. Now, after the efforts of the paper mill workers to restore production, all four paper mills have resumed operation. During the resumption of work movement, the employees of various factories and railways have demonstrated a high degree of construction enthusiasm and have contributed large quantities of materials to help restore work. The workers of the First Paper Mill repaired the boiler room and the severely damaged seven-story building in 24 days, saving 2,000 workdays. The workers of the Railway Bureau contributed 7,496 machine parts, worth more than 2.7 million yuan at the current prices. The workers of the Textile Factory also contributed materials worth more than 300,000 yuan. The amount contributed by workers in other factories is also huge. The work efficiency of employees in various factories has greatly improved. The Anshan-Shenyang Railway has run 1,794 times in the past six months, carrying more than 250,000 passengers, transporting more than 100,000 tons of goods, and transporting 50,000 tons of coal, while completing military transport tasks. The Anshan Textile Factory has exceeded the original production plan by 11 percent. In July last year, each spindle in the factory could only spin 6.55 taels of yarn per day, but by December, it had increased to 7.69 taels. When making a certain machine part, the workers in the mechanical section used to make only 1,000 pieces per day with three people, but now they have increased it by more than seven times. The workers at the Saimao Mine have also increased coal mining from 0.4 tons per person per day to 0.6 tons. The workers have also demonstrated a high degree of creativity. For example, after five days of research, the Anshan textile workers independently manufactured more than 120 "rubbing basins," saving 4 million yuan. Liu Chunfang, a foundry worker at the Anshan-Shenyang Railway Bureau, created the "expansion ring" for the air compressor on the locomotive, making a great contribution.

    工人献出大量物资帮助建设
    安东公营企业大发展
    工作效率比蒋占时期无不倍增
    【新华社东北二十五日电】安东各公营企业半年来获得很大发展。安东纺织厂在过去蒋匪统治的七个半月中，只有十二架纺机，四千八百个锭子，我收复至今六个多月，已有纺机三十三架，锭子三万九千六百二十个，及织布机二百五十二架。电业局在安东解放次日即恢复送电，六个月来供电量较蒋匪统治时增加一倍半，并增加电灯四千七百廿六盏，路灯五千四百九十七盏，及电热五百五十六基罗瓦特，增添动力机二百六十四架。安东造纸厂在蒋匪统治时仅有两个工厂，除六合成纸厂有一架小型机器开动外，其余各厂均未开工，现经造纸工人努力恢复，四个造纸厂已全部开工。各工厂及铁路员工，在复工运动中，均高度发挥了建设热情，并纷纷献出大批物资，帮助恢复工作，第一造纸厂工人二十四天内修好锅炉房及破坏不堪的七层大楼，并省工二千个。铁路局工人献出机器零件七千四百九十六件，按当时物价计算价值二百七十余万元。纺织厂工人也献出价值三十余万的物资。其他各工厂工人所献为数亦巨。各工厂员工，工作效率大为提高。安沈铁路半年中行车一千七百九十四次，载乘客达二十五万余人，运货十余万吨，运煤五万吨，并完成军运任务。安东纺织厂已超过原定生产计划百分之十一，该厂去年七月份每一个锭子每天只能纺线六·五五两，十二月份已增加到七·六九两。机械股工人在作某一机件时，过去每天三个人只作一千件，现在提高七倍以上。赛马矿山工人亦由过去每天每人挖煤○·四吨增加至○·六吨。工人们还发挥了高度的创造性，如安东纺织工人经五天研究结果，即自造“搓盆”一百二十余个，节省四百万元。安沈铁路局翻砂工人刘春芳，创造了机车上空气压缩机之“涨圈”，贡献极大。
