Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: According to consolidated reports from newspapers in Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, as Shanghai rice prices surged to 4.5 million around the latter half of March, grain prices in other areas controlled by Chiang Kai-shek also soared. On the 20th, Tianjin flour reached 2.08 million per bag, an increase of 240,000 compared to the 9th of the same month; millet reached 2.96 million per load. On the same day, flour in Beiping reached 2.02 million per bag, and corn flour also reached 20,000 per jin. On the 19th in Baoding, second-grade flour also sold for 1.7 million per bag; rice rose to 450,000 per dou, and millet to 280,000 per dou. On the 21st, Qingdao flour jumped to 2.55 million per bag, an increase of 300,000 compared to the 11th. In Xi'an, a wheat-producing area, flour rose from 900,000 to 1.2 million per bag in one day on the 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: According to consolidated reports from various sources, grain prices in Taiyuan have soared shockingly. Millet was 4 million per load on February 10th, jumped to 10 million on March 9th, and reached 14.5 million on the 8th of this month. On the same day, flour was 5.8 million per bag, corn flour was 95,000 per jin, and wheat was 14 million per load. The main reason for the soaring grain prices is the endless plunder by the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandit gangs. In 1947, the Yan Xishan area requisitioned over 540,000 loads of grain for taxes and loans, leaving the people with nothing to cook. Recently, even before the wheat fields have turned green, they have strictly ordered the "purchase" of 310,000 shi of military grain over three months. The bandit gangs are plundering grain from the people, leaving not a single grain behind. In Fengyugou Village, Fifth District of Taiyuan, dozens of households have had their wheat requisitioned six times since last autumn, totaling more than 150,000 shi, and all the grain harvested by the peasants is not enough to pay. The grain in Nanyukou Village, Taiyuan, was completely looted by the Yan Xishan bandits, even the seeds were taken away. The famine in the Yan Xishan area is now unprecedentedly severe.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Reports from newspapers in Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas: Due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' frantic search for military grain, grain prices in Hubei and Sichuan, known as the rice bowl of the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, have soared. In the latter half of last month, the price of rice in Hankou jumped to over 3 million per load, creating a serious famine. Grain prices in the Chengdu area of ​​Sichuan have also risen sharply. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit's puppet organizations, the Sichuan and Hubei provincial and Hankou municipal councils, had to admit that the main reason for the rise in grain prices was the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' search for military grain. When Yu Feipeng, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Minister of Food, went to Sichuan last month to supervise the requisition of military grain, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's provincial council in Sichuan stated: "Recently, wherever Minister Yu's footsteps reach, grain prices are seen to soar." The bandit's Hubei provincial and Hankou municipal councils also said in a telegram to the bandit's Ministry of Food that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' purchase of grain in Hubei had caused grain prices to rise, and exclaimed in alarm: The people cannot live and will automatically seize grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Shanghai report: The Chiang Kai-shek currency is deteriorating. On the 8th, the black market price of US dollars rose by 90,000 compared to the 6th, reaching 660,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency. Gold rose from 31 million per tael on the 7th to 36 million, an increase of 3.5 million compared to the highest price on the 19th of last month, and stocks also rose sharply.

　　蒋区各大城市粮价惊人飞涨
  　太原每担米千四百万
    【新华社陕北十三日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：三月下半月当上海米价涨到四百五十万大关前后，蒋区各地粮价亦均飞涨。二十日天津面粉每袋涨达蒋币二百零八万元，较该市同月九日上升二十四万元；小米每担涨达二百九十六万元。同日北平面粉每袋涨到二百零二万元，玉米面每斤亦涨到两万元。保定十九日二等面粉每袋也卖到一百七十万元；大米则涨到每斗四十五万元，小米每斗二十八万元。二十一日青岛面粉每袋跳到二百五十五万元，较十一日上升三十万。产麦地区的西安二十日一天内面粉每袋由九十万涨至一百二十万。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】综合各方消息：太原粮价惊人飞涨，小米每担在二月十日为四百万元，三月九日跃至一千万元，而本月八日已涨到一千四百五十万元。同日面粉每袋五百八十万元，玉米面每斤九万五千元，小麦每担一千四百万元。粮价飞涨的主要原因为蒋阎匪帮之无穷掠夺；一九四七年度阎区田赋征实征借五十四万多担，已使人民悬釜断炊，最近麦田未青又严令“征购”三个月军粮三十一万市石。匪帮搜刮民间粮食，不留颗粒。太原五区凤峪沟村几十户人家，去秋以来被征麦子六次，共一百五千多石，农民收获的全部粮食尚不够缴纳。太原南峪口村的粮食被阎匪全部抢完，连种子也被抢走。现阎区粮荒已空前严重。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】蒋区报纸讯：由于蒋匪疯狂搜乱军粮，号称蒋区米仓的湖北、四川粮价飞涨。上月下旬汉口米价每担一跃而突破蒋币三百万大关，已形成严重粮荒。四川成都一带粮价亦突飞猛涨。蒋匪御用的川鄂两省及汉市参议会都不得不承认，粮涨的主要原因为蒋匪搜刮军粮。上月蒋匪粮食部长俞飞鹏到川督催勒购军粮时，川省蒋匪参议会即称：“最近俞部长足迹所至，粮价即见飞涨。”匪鄂省及汉市两参议会致匪粮食部电中，也说蒋匪在鄂购粮，促使粮价上涨，并惊呼：人民不能生活，将自动抢粮。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】沪讯：上海蒋币每况愈下，八日黑市美钞较六日又腾涨九万元，而达蒋币六十六万元。黄金由七日之每两三千一百万而达三千六百万，较上月十九日的最高价又涨三百五十万，股票亦急剧上涨。
