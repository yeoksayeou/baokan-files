　　【Our News】The Xiazhuang Work Team of the Wu'an Ninth District Work Group arrived in the village on the afternoon of the 14th and immediately held small investigative meetings in separate groups. On the one hand, they learned about the general situation of the village and the branch's situation from the branch and cadres; on the other hand, they learned from the masses in various streets their opinions on the cadres and party members, and their current urgent demands. According to preliminary materials, the village has 756 households, 2,336 people, 6,494.08 mu of land, and a yield of 7,830 shi, 5 dou, and 5 sheng. On average, each person has about 2.78 mu of land and a yield of 3 shi, 3 dou, and 5 sheng. The land has been generally evenly distributed, with middle peasants possessing more land and yield. Party members, cadres, and family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers generally have higher yields and occupy more of the fruits of struggle.

　　The Xiazhuang branch was established relatively early, with 18 party members in 1938. By 1947, a total of 69 party members had been developed. After excluding 14 who were expelled, 11 who joined the army, 9 who went out to work, 2 who sacrificed themselves, and 1 whose party membership was suspended, there are currently 46 party members. Among them, 22 are from poor peasant and farm laborer backgrounds, 13 are middle peasants, 7 are small businessmen, 1 is from a household that was struggled against (the class status has not been clarified), and 3 are adjustment households. All six branch secretaries are middle peasants, and middle peasants account for two of the four group leaders. This is a branch where middle peasants account for the majority and middle peasants are in power.

　　Since its establishment, the branch has led the anti-Kuomintang "five-equal share" levy in 1938, the grain borrowing in 1942, the double reduction in 1943, the gun account calculation and grain hiding account calculation in 1944, the anti-traitor liquidation in 1945, and the filling-in and compensation in 1946 and other movements. However, due to the unfair distribution of the fruits of struggle—militia members received 20%, family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers received 15%, cadres received 10%, and the masses received 10%—some of the masses were not thoroughly emancipated. According to the masses, Wang Sanbao and his father and brothers have great power, and most of the masses dare not speak. The masses' demands for democracy are extremely urgent. Based on this general situation, the work team decided to adjust the party ranks and reorganize party members simultaneously. In order to make the party rectification work more effective, it was also decided to first solicit party members' opinions on party rectification before announcing the principles and steps of party rectification. The conversations with party members proved that they were well prepared. Party member Wang Youhong said, "I have read in the newspaper that the fruits of struggle that are over-occupied should be returned. I will return five mu of land in Xiping." Several other party members spoke only of returning land, and did not mention other issues. When it came to the method of party rectification, their opinion was that the masses should do the rectification, because the branch would not be able to overcome personal relationships and would not be able to do a good job. In order to break the harmonious atmosphere within the branch, the work team decided to combine self-criticism, intra-party criticism, and mass criticism; to combine self-clarification of right and wrong, intra-party clarification of right and wrong, and mass clarification of right and wrong, so as to achieve a combination of self-resolution, intra-party resolution, and mass resolution.

　　Obstacles were also encountered in mobilizing the masses. Last year, the Taihang District Party Committee Work Group worked in Xiazhuang for three months, organized poor peasant and farm laborer production teams, and appointed production committee members, which troubled the masses but did not solve the problem. The poor peasant and farm laborer organizations and committee members were complex in composition, and many had been co-opted by the cadres and had become "Chen Xiaoyuan" (a character in Li Youcai's ballad, a cadre who wants to be important), detached from the masses. Therefore, the work team decided to first classify the class status, reorganize the ranks, and then decide on the steps and principles for reorganizing the teams. Class status classification in each street was completed on the 16th. On the night of the 16th, the working principles and steps were announced at a village-wide meeting, and the mobilization for class status classification throughout the village was carried out. The masses unanimously agreed to carry out democratic party rectification and democratic compensation work during the agricultural slack season after cotton planting and before the Grain in Ear (芒种) solar term. On the morning of the 17th, meetings were held separately in each street to study specific implementation methods that closely combine production and work.

### 武安九区工作团夏庄工作组　全面研究情况  决定工作方针

　　武安九区工作团夏庄工作组
  　全面研究情况  决定工作方针
    【本报消息】武安九区工作团夏庄工作组于十四日下午到达该村，即分头召开小型调查会，一方面从支部、干部中了解全村概况及支部情况；另一方面从各街群众中了解他们对干部党员的意见，及当前的迫切要求。依据初步材料，全村共有七百五十六户，二千三百三十六人，六千四百九十四亩零八厘土地，七千八百三十石五斗五升产量，大约平均每人二亩七分八厘土地，三石三斗五升产量。土地已大体平分，中农占有较多土地和产量，党员、干部、抗属一般的产量高，多占斗争果实。
    夏庄支部建立较早，一九三八年即有党员十八人，到四七年共发展党员六十九人，除先后开除十四人，参军十一人，出外参加工作九人，牺牲二人，停止党籍一人以外，现有党员四十六人，其中贫雇成份有二十二人，中农十三人，小商人七人，被斗户一人（成份尚未弄清），调剂户三人。六个支干全系中农，四个小组长中农占二人，这是个中农占多数，中农当权的支部。
    支部成立以来，曾领导过一九三八年的反国民党五等派款，四二年的借粮，四三年的双减，四四年的算枪帐，算藏粮，四五年的反奸清算，四六年的填平补齐等运动。但由于果实分配不公，民兵二十分，抗属十五分，干部十分，群众十分；因此一部分群众翻身不够彻底。据群众反映王三保父兄三个权力很大，大多数群众不敢说话，群众的民主要求异常迫切。工作组根据这种概况，决定调整党的队伍与整编党内人员双管齐下，为了使整党工作更能对症下药，又决定先征询党员对整党的意见后，再宣布整党的方针和步骤，从党员的谈话中证明他们是早有准备的。党员王友虹说：“看过报纸，多占果实该退就退，我退西坪地五亩。”其他有几个党员都是一说话就是退地，其他问题概不涉及。提到整党的方法，他们的意见是群众整最好，支部打不破情面，无法整好。工作组为了打破支部内的一团和气，决定自己批评，党内批评，群众批评结合进行；自己明辨是非，党内明辨是非，结合群众的明辨是非，以达到自己解决，党内解决与群众解决相结合。
    在发动群众工作上也遇到障碍。去年太行区党委工作团在夏庄曾工作过三个月，组织了贫雇生产小组，指定了生产委员，麻烦了群众，但没有解决问题，贫雇组织与贫雇委员中成份复杂，且已被干部拉拢住不少，好多已经变成“陈小元”（李有才板话里，一个当了干部要气派的人物），脱离了群众。因此工作组决定先划阶级，重整阵营，再决定整编队伍的步骤和方针。十六日各街试划阶级已进行完毕。十六日夜，全村村民大会上宣布了工作的方针和步骤，并进行了全村划阶级的动员，群众一致同意在种棉花后，芒种前的农时间隙中，进行民主整党与民主抽补工作。于十七日上午，各街分别开会研究生产与工作密切结合的具体执行办法。
