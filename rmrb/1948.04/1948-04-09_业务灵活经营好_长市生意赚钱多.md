　　Good Flexible Business Operations
  　Lead to More Profits in Changzhi
    [Changzhi City News] There are thirteen production units on Xin Nan Street in the Second District of Changzhi City, and generally speaking, they are all making money. Among the thirteen production units, except for the carpenters, tailors, Xin Sheng Store, and steamed bun shop, most of the others are engaged in mixed businesses, combining workshops with street vending. For example, Xin Shengyuan grinds flour and noodles, buys and slaughters pigs, and also has a sundry goods shop; Xin Shengchang grinds flour, makes vinegar, has a grocery stall, and also an oil and salt stall. These are the larger production units on the street, with more capital and personnel, and they are also very profitable. For example, Xin Shengyuan and Xin Shengchang have a complete return of capital and profit in just three months. The main reasons for making money are: (1) Flexible business operations. Their capital and labor are combined, and the allocation of personnel and use of funds are very flexible. They focus their efforts according to market conditions, concentrating on whichever business is profitable. For example, Xin Shengyuan and Xin Shengchang focus on grinding flour in October and November when it is profitable, and then switch to other businesses when grinding flour is no longer profitable. For example, Xin Shengyuan focused on buying and slaughtering pigs in December and before the fifteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, slaughtering more than 400 pigs in a month and earning four million yuan; now that pork is not selling well, they immediately switched to sundry goods. The first time they brought three million yuan to Shimen to buy goods, they earned six hundred thousand yuan when they returned; the second time they bought goods in Shimen and Linqing, which was also very profitable. (2) Studying sales channels, mastering the situation, and taking care of customers. For example, Xin Shengyuan used to make money making vermicelli in December of last year, but it didn't work after the first month of the lunar calendar. Now that broad bean starch noodles (used for making cold noodles) are selling well, they have switched to grinding broad bean starch. They said, "We have to sell whatever goods are in demand at the time." Also, Xin Shengyuan and Xin Shengchang jointly stepped on forty shih of koji, earning a net profit of 400,000 yuan, and wanted to continue stepping on it; after studying the situation, they found that many people in Xia Nan Street and other streets were also stepping on koji, fearing that sales would not be fast in the future, so they stopped.
    Because flexible business operations are profitable, they don't have to worry about expanding their capital. Among these production units, except for the sauce workshop and Xin Shengchang, which have other reasons for not being able to expand their capital, the rest have been developing their capital very quickly. For example, Xin Shengyuan only started organizing in September last year, and the total shares collected at that time were only 240,000 yuan. In October, they increased it by 1.2 million yuan, in November by 350,000 yuan, in December by 300,000 yuan, and in January by more than 130,000 yuan. By the end of January, it had expanded to 2,128,000 yuan. The vegetable shop originally started with 265,000 yuan and has now grown to more than 1.6 million yuan. Huasheng Store initially started with 140,000 yuan and has developed to 400,000 yuan in four months. The mountain goods business has grown from 600,000 yuan to 1,710,000 yuan.

　　业务灵活经营好
  　长市生意赚钱多
    【长治市消息】长市二区新南街，共有十三个生产单位，一般说来都很赚钱。十三个生产单位中，除木匠、裁缝铺、新胜店和蒸馍铺外，其余大部都是混合业务，都是作坊结合摊贩。如新胜源是磨面、磨粉、买猪杀猪，另外还结合碎货铺；新胜昌是磨面、做醋、结合一个杂货摊，还有一个油盐摊。这些是该街较大的生产单位，资金多、人员也多，也很赚钱。如新胜源、新胜昌等，都是三个月一个本利对还多。赚钱的主要原因是：（一）业务灵活。他们是资金劳力在一起，人员分配资金运用上，都是十分灵活，根据市场情况有重点的使用力量，哪个业务赚钱就集中火力搞哪个。如新胜源、新胜昌，在十月、十一月磨面可以，他们就把力量用在磨面上，后来磨面不行即转向其他。如新胜源在腊月和正月十五前转在买猪杀猪上，一个月即杀了四百多口猪，赚洋四百来万；现在猪肉不快，马上又转向碎货上。第一次带洋三百万到石门买货，回来就赚洋六十万；二次又到石门、临清买货也很赚钱。（二）研究销路、掌握情况、照顾顾客。如新胜源去年腊月下粉条还赚钱，一到正月以后就不行了，现在大粉快（做凉粉用）即转向磨大粉，他们说：“赶到啥时就得销啥货”。又如新胜源、新胜昌，合伙踩了四十石曲，净赚洋四十万元，还想继续踩；后经研究下南街踩曲很多，其它街也踩，恐将来销路不快，即停止不踩。
    由于业务灵活赚钱多，所以在扩大资金上也不发愁。这几个生产单位中，除酱坊和新胜昌有其他原因资金扩不大外，下余资金发展都很快。如新胜源去年九月才开始组织，当时集股一共才二十四万元，到十月份就增入了一百二十万，十一月增入三十五万，十二月增入三十万，一月增入十三万多，一月底就扩大到二百一十二万八千元。菜铺原来是二十六万五千元搞起的，现在发展到一百六十多万。华胜店起初是十四万元搞起的，四个月已发展到四十万元，山货由六十万元发展到一百七十一万元。（丕吉、文北、新华）
