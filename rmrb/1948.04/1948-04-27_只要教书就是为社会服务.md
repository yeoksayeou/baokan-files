    As Long as You Teach, You Are Serving Society
    To the Editors:
    We have a confusing question that we can't figure out, please answer it.
    In the old society, most teachers were from landlord or rich peasant backgrounds. Did these people serve society? If people from landlord or rich peasant backgrounds are teaching now, does that count as serving society? We currently have the following opinion: regardless of whether they teach or not, their class status remains unchanged, and we still don’t acknowledge that they are serving society.

    The Operations Group of the He Village Yarn Factory: The spirit of the question you raised does not align with the spirit of the Central Bureau’s February 1st Directive and other important documents. The Central Bureau’s February 1st Directive points out: "It is also wrong to classify intellectuals who engage in mental labor and do not rely on feudal exploitation as landlords and rich peasants." Comrade Ren Bishi spoke very clearly about the policy toward intellectuals in "Several Questions in Land Reform," stating that we cannot adopt any adventurous policies toward mental laborers who make a living through their knowledge and skills and should try our best to encourage them to serve the people. Your statement that regardless of whether they teach or not, their class status remains unchanged and we cannot consider them as serving society is wrong.

    只要教书就是为社会服务编辑同志：
    我们有个糊涂问题闹不清楚，请答复一下。
    在旧社会教学的人，大半都是地主富农成份，这些人是否为社会服务？地主富农成份，现在教学算不算为社会服务？我们现有这样的一个意见：不管他教学与否，他的成份不变，仍不承认是为社会服务。
                和村纱厂经营科小组
    和村纱厂经营科小组：你们提问题的精神是和中央局二一指示等各重要文件精神不符的。中央局二一指示中，指出：“将从事脑力劳动，而不依靠封建剥削的知识分子划为地主富农，也是错误的”。任弼时同志在“土地改革中的几个问题”中关于对待知识分子的政策讲得十分明白，对于依靠自己的知识和技能谋生活的脑力劳动者，不能采取任何冒险政策，应当尽量急取他们为人民服务。你们说不管他们教学与否，他的成份不变就不能认为他们是为社会服务的说法是错误的。
