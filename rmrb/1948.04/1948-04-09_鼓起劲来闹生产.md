　　Now that the Qingming Festival has passed, the work in the fields must be hurried along. We should buck up and push for production. Until now, some middle peasants still have knots in their hearts, worrying about returning grain in the future, and some say that they haven't been struggled against in the past, and they aren't sure when it will be their turn. These ideas are all wrong. The Border Region Government's public notice stipulates that whoever plants, harvests. The Land Law Outline stipulates that the floating wealth of middle peasants will not be touched. How much grain middle peasants harvest is their own, so there shouldn't be any more concerns! Some middle peasants say that they aren't sure when it will be their turn to be struggled against, that is also a muddled idea. In the future, class designation will be based on regulations, and no one is allowed to act recklessly. In the past, some places wrongly struggled against middle peasants using methods such as investigating three generations, estimating piles, and drawing lots. These will be corrected, and errors will not be allowed to happen again in the future. Wang Pangren, a middle peasant from Tinghepu in Licheng, said it well: "The Land Law Outline is for us. Spring is short this year, so if we don't hurry up with spring plowing, and don't plant the land, and don't harvest the grain, we are harming ourselves." Production should start early, don't fall behind. Everyone should buck up and work quickly and work hard!

　　鼓起劲来闹生产
    清明节过了，地里活该赶紧了，咱们应该鼓起劲好好闹生产。直到现在，有些中农心里还有疙瘩，担心以后往出退粮食，还有的说过去没斗我，定不住那个时候轮到我头上。这种想法都不对，边府布告规定谁种谁收，土地法大纲规定不动中农浮财，中农收下多少粮食都是自己的，不应该再有啥顾虑啦！有些中农说定不住啥时轮上斗自己，那也是糊涂想法，以后划成份都得根据规定，谁也不准乱来，过去有的地方用查三代，估圪堆、拈嘟芦的办法错斗了中农都要纠正，以后更不许再发生错误了。黎城停河铺中农王胖仁说得好：“土地法大纲就是为了咱，今年春又短，还不赶快春耕，种不上地，打不下粮食，是自己害了自己。”生产要早动手，不要落后，大家应该鼓起劲来快快干、好好干！
