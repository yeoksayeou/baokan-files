　　Democratic Far East Policy Committee

　　The Democratic Far East Policy Committee of the United States was established in the summer of 1945 and is composed of American scholars and celebrities who have studied the Far East and China issues. Famous reporters Strong, Epstein, Stein, Rullman, black singer Robeson, and Far East problem writer Bisson are all members of the association. The former chairman of the association was Rear Admiral Carlson. After Carlson's death last year, it is rumored that his work is now being carried out by Russell, the executive director of the association's board of directors. The association has two purposes: (1) to educate the American people with the true situation in the Far East; (2) to mobilize American public opinion to oppose the US government's interference in the internal affairs of other countries and the support of reactionaries in the Far East countries, and to demand that the authorities implement a democratic Far East policy. The association is not only an academic research group, but also one of the groups that actively guide and organize the American people to oppose Truman's current reactionary Far East policy. The association often holds small-scale lectures and seminars on Far East issues. In October 1946, it also launched a large-scale "US troops withdraw from China Week" campaign, holding mass rallies in thirty-five cities. At the end of January this year, it also sponsored the National Conference on Democratic Policy of the United States toward China and the Far East, and formulated a democratic US Far East policy program. The current "China Week" against aid to Chiang is one of the important resolutions of the meeting.
