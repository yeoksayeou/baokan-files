    Leftist Recklessness Endangers School Education
    Qinshui Has Not Yet Corrected
    Heshun Kaiwen Education Committee Has Made a Preliminary Review
    [Taiyue News] In Qinshui, last year the rural struggle methods were recklessly applied in various schools. Under the one-sided poor peasant and hired laborer viewpoint, a large number of middle peasants and children of landlords and rich peasants were struggled against and purged. When the entire county took the "hired and poor route" last year, it started with No. 1 High School. The principal and teachers held a meeting to study why the school work in the past had not been done well, because it did not take hired and poor peasants as the backbone to take the "hired and poor route." Therefore, in the future, it would be necessary to achieve hired and poor leadership with middle peasants participating, and to control landlords. In addition to organizing "hired and poor peasant groups," a hired and poor peasant committee was also established as the leading backbone of the school. Subsequently, classes were suspended, and three generations were traced to determine class status. A total of 20 "landlords," 39 "rich peasants," one "second landlord," and 29 "middle peasant targets" were identified. There were also 11 students with impure motives for entering the school. Those with problems accounted for more than 40% of all students. No. 5 High School also established a "school court." At the beginning of the struggle, beatings were carried out, and more than 60 students were purged. The method of controlling the struggle targets was also adopted, requiring all students to take turns guarding them at night. In addition to confiscating the books and stationery of the students who were targets of struggle, even their shoes, socks, and clothing were all confiscated. In the entire county, only in middle and high schools, more than 400 students were purged, and the number of those purged in primary schools was not even calculated. At the same time, 186 teachers were purged from various schools, including many students and teachers who were middle peasants. For example, No. 7 High School purged 24 "backward middle peasant students." This kind of leftist behavior has not been corrected until now, and the hired and poor peasant groups can manage everything in the school.
    [Heshun News] From March 11th to 22nd, this county held a study conference for 243 cultural and educational cadres, attended by 215 teachers from senior and junior primary schools and 28 members of the county drama troupe. Regarding the biases and undesirable tendencies in past education work, the following points were reviewed: One was that teachers from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds complained everywhere because their families had been struggled against. Another was deliberate "leftism." During the Three Investigations, children were beaten, believing that the more children expelled, the clearer the class line would be. Those from poor peasant and hired laborer backgrounds were onlookers or recklessly acted blindly, moving a set of mass movements into the school. For example, in Xiaoguai Village, District 3, an anti-corruption campaign was launched in the school (because children of landlords and rich peasants had been cadres in the past). In addition to expulsion, a fine of 30,000 yuan and three mu of land was imposed. Of the 32 children in the entire village, 22 were expelled. In District 2, 535 children were expelled from 30 natural villages, and their books and stationery were confiscated and distributed to other students. Some participated in the movement in order to get more fruits for the school and themselves, to impress the superiors. Another was the belief that combining with the central work meant giving up or reducing education work. Still others overemphasized student labor. For example, No. 2 High School spent a lot of time having students repair houses, sell tofu, and sell meals, claiming to solve the school's difficulties. The masses reflected: "Having them work in the school like that is not as good as having them work at home." The school in Xiaoguai Village opened a peanut shop, which not only affected learning but also led to primary school students stealing money at home, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Still another was disunity among teachers (mainly in high schools), forming small cliques among students, fighting for power, and treating students as their orderlies. Teachers do not study, and very few even read newspapers. Some individual schools do not even have newspapers. They do not understand many things themselves and do not ask others for fear of losing face. (Zhang Shulin)
    Editor's note: The Heshun cultural and educational conference's examination of the above-mentioned undesirable phenomena is very good. However, in the subsequent discussions and resolutions, only detailed plans were made for study courses and other plans. There are still no concrete methods for solving and correcting the above-mentioned problems, showing that the determination to correct errors is still not firm, which deserves inspection by the leadership.

    左倾蛮干危害学校教育
    沁水至今尚未纠正
    和顺开文教会作了初步检讨
    【太岳消息】沁水各校，去年胡乱搬用了农村斗争方式，在片面贫雇观点下，斗争与清洗了大批中农及地主富农子弟。去年全县走“雇贫路线”时，首先从一高开始，校长教员开会研究了过去学校工作没搞好，是没有以雇贫为骨干走“雇贫路线”，所以今后要做到雇贫领导中农参加，管制地主。除组织“雇贫小组”外，又成立了雇贫委员会，作为学校的领导骨干。随后停止上课，追三代划成份，共划出廿个“地主”，卅九个“富农”，一个“二东家”，廿九个“中农对象”，还有十一个是入校动机不良。有问题的占全校学生百分之四十强。五高还成立了“学校法庭”。斗争一开始就打，清洗了六十多个学生，又采用管制斗争对象办法，叫全体学生黑夜轮流看守，除把斗争对象学生的书籍文具没收外，连鞋袜衣物也全部没收了。全县仅中高学校，就清洗了学生四百多人，初校里清洗的还没有计算。同时各校清洗了教员一百八十六人，其中中农成份的学生教员也不少。如七高就清洗了“落后中农生”廿四人，这种左倾行为，直到现在还没纠正，雇贫组可以管理学校一切。
    【和顺消息】本县在三月十一日，至二十二日举行全县二四三个文教干部学习会议，出席高、初小教员二一五人，县剧团二八人。关于过去教育工作中偏向与不良倾向，检讨出以下几种：一种是地富出身的教员因斗争了自己家庭，到处发牢骚，一种是故意“左”。在三查时吊打儿童，认为越开除的儿童多，阶级路线就越明确。贫雇出身的是旁观，或盲目乱干，把群众运动的一套搬进学校。如三区小拐村在学校里开展反贪污（因地富儿童过去当干部），除开除外，还罚了三万元钱，三亩地。全村三十二个儿童就开除了二十二个。二区三十个自然村开除了五百三十五个儿童，并将书籍文具没收分配给其他学生，有的参加运动是为了给学校、给自己多分些果实，让上级看起自己，另一种是认为结合中心工作就得放弃或少作教育工作，还有的过度强调学生劳动，如二高费很多时间让学生修盖房子，卖豆腐，卖饭等，说是解决学校困难。群众反映：“有那样到学校作营生，还不如在咱家劳动哩。”小拐村学校开花生铺，除影响学习外，还形成小学生回家偷钱，引起群众不满。再一种是教员之间（主要是高校）闹不团结，在学生中闹小集团，互相争权，把学生当成自己的勤务员。教员不学习，经常看报的也很少，甚至有个别学校连报纸都没有。自己有许多事情不懂得，也不问人，怕丢人。（张树林）
    编者按：和顺这次文教会议对上述不良现象的检查是很好的。但在后面的讨论与决议中，只是详细订了学习课程等计划，对上述问题的解决与纠正，仍无具体办法，表现对纠正错误仍不坚决，值得领导上检查。
