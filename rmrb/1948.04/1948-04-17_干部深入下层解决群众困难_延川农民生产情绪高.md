　　Cadres Go Deep into Lower Levels to Solve People's Difficulties
　　YanChuan Peasants' Production Enthusiasm is High
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th] The leadership problem in organizing mass production in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has attracted attention in various places. Qingyan District in Yanchuan County, which is under the Yan [River] Prefecture, and Wuqi County in the Sanbian Prefecture, have become two contrasting examples. Farmers in Qingyan District, Yanchuan County, have now sown 1,486 hectares of peas. All 1,414 male and female laborers in the district have been swept into the production upsurge. The main reason is that the cadres in the district can specifically lead mass production, play a leading role in all aspects, and specifically solve the difficulties of the masses in spring plowing. For example, when cadre Hao Yanshou mobilized the masses to adjust pea seeds, he took the lead by lending eight sheng [approx. 8 liters] to four households that lacked seeds. Influenced by him, other households with seeds took out their surplus seeds to lend to households that lacked seeds. Hui Yigong, the head of a township, investigated that four households in Liujiazhuang had no seeds, and he focused on mobilizing three households with surplus seeds to make adjustments. Currently, 11 shi [approx. 1100 liters] and 6 sheng of pea seeds have been adjusted in the district, solving the seed difficulties of 189 households. At the same time, more than 11,800 jin [approx. 5900 kg] of cattle forage has been adjusted, solving the forage difficulties of 108 households. The lent seeds and cattle forage will be repaid after the autumn harvest. The cadres also took the lead in mobilizing households lacking forage in the district to go to the mountains to cut grass, totaling more than 14,400 jin, and the cattle forage problem was completely solved. A total of 27 shi and 5.5 dou [approx. 2755 liters] of adjusted grain and relief grain were used to solve the problem of food shortage for 191 households during spring plowing. In contrast, Wuqi County did not promptly and appropriately resolve the deviations in the land reform. In some areas, the grain of the newly rich peasants and wealthy middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against was eaten, and the matter was dealt with sloppily, or while repaying it, donations were raised, causing some middle peasants to doubt the policies of "labor starting a family" and not touching the middle peasants. At the same time, the cadres only made general calls for spring plowing and did not specifically solve the difficulties of poor farmers such as plowing cattle, seeds, and rations, so the enthusiasm of the peasants for production was not high. Currently, the Sanbian Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office are actively correcting this phenomenon, and the main cadres of the prefecture are going to the countryside to go deep into the lower levels and specifically lead spring plowing.

### 干部深入下层解决群众困难　延川农民生产情绪高

　　干部深入下层解决群众困难
  　延川农民生产情绪高
    【新华社西北十二日电】陕甘宁边区组织群众大生产中的领导问题，已引起各地注意。延属分区延川县的清延区和三边分区吴旗县恰成为两种不同的对比。延川县清延区农民现已下种豌豆一千四百八十六垧。全区一千四百一十四个男女劳动力都卷入生产热潮中。主要原因是由于该区干部能具体领导群众生产，在各方面起带头作用，并且体解决群众在春耕中的困难问题。如干部郝延寿在发动群众调剂豌豆籽时，他首先以身作则拿出八升借给四户缺籽的农民，其他有籽户在他影响下纷纷拿出自己多余种子借给缺籽户。一乡乡长惠义功在刘家庄调查出四户没有种子，即着重动员有长余种子的三户进行调剂。现全区豌豆籽已调剂十一石零六升，解决了一百八十九户的种子困难。同时调剂了牛草一万一千八百多斤，解决了一百零八户缺草困难，借出的种子和牛草待秋收后偿还。干部并带头发动全区缺草户上山割草，共割了一万四千四百多斤，牛草问题获得全部解决。又用调剂粮和救济粮共二十七石五斗五升，解决了一百九十一户春耕中的吃粮问题。相反的，吴旗县对土改中所犯的偏向没有及时适当解决，有些地区把斗错的新富农和富裕中农的粮食吃掉了，马虎了事，或一面退偿，一面又募捐，致一部分中农对“劳动起家”和不动中农的政策引起怀疑。同时干部对春耕只作了一般号召，没有具体解决贫苦农民的耕牛、种子、口粮等困难，因此农民生产情绪不高。现三边地委和专署正积极纠正此现象，分区主要干部纷纷下乡，深入下层具体领导春耕。
