Weekly War Situation

　　From Northeast to Central Plains, From Northwest to East China
  　Spring Offensive Fully Unfolded
    Our Army Annihilated 140,000 Bandits and Captured 46 Cities in One Month
    March 25th to 31st
    Since the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Army launched a large-scale offensive against the Ping-Sui Railway, the powerful spring offensive of the People's Liberation Army has been fully unfolded and has achieved the expected brilliant results. Now, from Northeast to Central Plains, from Northwest to East China, offensive follows offensive, and victory is rapidly expanding. According to the already announced battle results, in March, we captured a total of 46 cities and annihilated more than 143,000 enemies.
    The Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Army launched an offensive in Chahar South and between Datong and Tianzhen on the Ping-Sui Railway on the 21st, to punish the North China people's public enemy, bandit Fu Zuoyi. Within five days, it successively recovered five county towns, including Yanggao, Guangling, Tianzhen, Yuxian, and Yangyuan, as well as more than ten strongholds of bandit Fu, including Xihuying, Taohuabao, Nuanquan, and Huashaoying, important towns in Chahar South. It also controlled five stations on the Ping-Sui Railway between Datong and Tianzhen, including Zhoushizhuang, Julebao, Wangguantun, Yanggao, and Luowenzao, and about one hundred li of the railway. The entire 31st Training Division and 17th Training Division of bandit Fu were annihilated, as well as a part of the 11th Cavalry Brigade, the 9th Security General Team of Chahar Province, one regiment of the Temporary 17th Division, the entire 2nd Security Regiment of the puppet Yanbei, and the puppet Guangling County Police Team. A total of more than 2,000 enemies were killed, including Huang Chunlie, commander of the 17th Training Division, and Guo Xipu, commander of the 31st Training Division, and more than 13,000 enemies were captured alive, including the chief of staff of the division and below. At the same time, the Jin-Sui Liberated Army also launched coordinated attacks west and north of Datong along the Great Wall line. From the 20th to the 23rd, it successively recovered four cities, including Fengzhen, Huairen, Zuoyun, and Youyu, as well as two important strongholds west of Datong, including Yungang and Gaoshanzhen. By this time, the vast area on both sides of the Sanggan River in Chahar South and west of the Datong-Puzhou Railway and south of the Great Wall in Yanbei was free of bandits. All counties in Yanbei, which were occupied by bandit Fu last March, have been completely recovered.
    From the 19th to the 23rd, the East China Liberated Army once again recovered Zhangqiu City and Minghui and Longshan stations in the area east of Jinan, shattering bandit chief Wang Yaowu's dream of sending five brigades to support Zichuan to the east. In five days of fighting, a total of 1,500 bandits were annihilated, and the vanguard of the Liberated Army has now reached the area 30 li east of Jinan. Another unit of the Liberated Army recovered Yidu on the 21st, and the Luzhong Local Corps recovered Yishui City on the 24th. The Chiang bandit's 2nd Security General Team and the puppet Commissioner's Office, which were entrenched in Dong'e and Pingyin, fled to Jinan on the 13th under the shock of our powerful offensive. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a special telegram to the East China military and civilians to congratulate them. The East China Spring Offensive is still continuing fiercely.
    The victorious offensive operations of the Northwest Liberated Army are also in full swing. On the 24th, it recovered Hancheng, an important stronghold of the Chiang-Hu bandits on the west bank of the Yellow River. The defending enemies fled south. On the night of the 25th, Taiyang was liberated, and on the same day, Huangbao Town, an important station on the Xianyang-Tongguan branch line of the Longhai Railway, was also captured. On the 27th, Chengcheng was liberated, and more than 600 people, including the puppet county magistrate Bai Zhixiu (captured), were annihilated and captured. By this time, all eight county seats in our newly established Huanglong Sub-district, except for the isolated city of Luochuan, have been liberated by us.
    The Liberated Army in the southern front new areas combined with local armed forces to attack the enemy and eliminate scattered bandits within the territory. On the 22nd, the Yu-Shaan-E Liberated Army annihilated more than 600 Chiang bandit troops who had invaded from Luoyang in the Xujiazhai and other areas on the outskirts of Luoyang. The local armed forces of the Third and Fourth Sub-districts cleared up Chiang bandit stragglers and local Chiang bandits in Shanyang, Luoning and other places from the 20th to the 24th, annihilating more than 1,000 enemies. On the 7th, the Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Liberated Army recovered Woyang City, and the defending enemies fled upon hearing the news. On the 9th, the local armed forces of the military region defeated 3,000 Chiang bandit security groups and local miscellaneous troops in the Hanliu area northeast of Zhengyang.
    The E-Yu-Wan Liberated Army and local armed forces are growing stronger and stronger, and they have launched attacks one after another, achieving repeated victories. On the 11th, the Jianghan Military Region simultaneously defeated one battalion of the Chiang bandit's New 17th Brigade and one battalion of the Chiang bandit's 164th Brigade in Suixian and Mianyang. On the 15th, they again defeated a part of the 92nd Brigade of the Chiang bandit's 69th Division in Bianhe, east of Jianli, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 400 enemy battalion commanders and below. Our army in the Tongbai Military Region is actively active on the west side of the Ping-Han Railway. On the 6th, they destroyed a railway bridge near Changtaiguan and destroyed the Sanguanmiao station. On the 7th, they captured Wang Dachong stronghold west of Changdian station, and on the 8th, they defeated one regiment of the Chiang bandit's 164th Brigade and a part of the local Chiang bandits in the Gouzhen area east of Xiangyang, annihilating a total of 400 enemies. Various military regions in western Anhui and Hubei also achieved many victories.
