Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan, 20th: The Yuwansu Liberated Area, near the west side of the Pinghan Railway, has newly established the Shabai (west of Yancheng, north of Wuyang) and Xuxi (west of Xuchang, east of Xiangcheng) two democratic county governments. Currently, the Yuwansu Liberated Area has a total of fifty-eight democratic county governments. Since the People's Liberation Army controlled the vast areas on both sides of the Pinghan Railway, the Fifth Military Sub-district of Yuwansu dispatched a part of the local armed forces to the border areas of Yancheng, Linying, and Wuyang counties to actively suppress local Chiang Kai-shek remnants and support the original people's self-organized anti-Chiang Kai-shek self-defense forces. The local people have a very high enthusiasm for struggle, and their self-defense forces voluntarily joined the local corps of our Fifth Military Sub-district in early February, and demanded the establishment of a democratic regime as soon as possible. At the request of the people, our Fifth Special Commissioner's Office established two new county governments to directly lead the mass movement for liberation.

Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan, 20th: In the battle to recover Zhumadian, an important station on the Pinghan Railway, on the night of the 7th, the People's Liberation Army properly protected the interests of the masses. That night, a train fully loaded with merchandise happened to be stopped at the station. The People's Liberation Army immediately sent troops to guard it. The next day, after detailed investigation and a conference with more than a dozen transshipment companies and hundreds of merchants, the goods on the train were distributed to their original owners one by one. After unloading the goods, the merchants voluntarily registered with the democratic government to pay taxes. Although the city is under the threat of Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft raids, the city is in good order and business is as usual. When a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army entered Zhumadian Station, residents on both sides of the railway mistakenly thought that Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were harassing them and fled their villages. The People's Liberation Army immediately comforted and explained the situation, and properly took care of the property and livestock left behind by the villagers. A certain platoon living in Zhao Village, east of the road, fed pigs, chickens, and ducks for the landlord Li Deren, picked mulberry leaves to feed silkworms, and left a letter telling him when they left. A certain unit living in Li Deyang's house burned some of his grass, and left food and a letter to compensate the landlord when they left.

Also reported: Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft have been indiscriminately strafing and bombing the suburbs of Zhumadian for days. On the 9th, four cars of the private Anda Automobile Company and others traveling to Jiehe were destroyed. On the 10th, three transport trucks were destroyed, causing huge losses to merchants and civilians. After learning about this, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army immediately carried out comfort and relief efforts.

　　豫皖苏在平汉路西侧
  　新建两个民主县政府
    解放军保护驻马店群众利益
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖二十日电】豫皖苏解放区近在平汉路西侧，新建沙北（郾城西舞阳北）许西（许昌西襄城东）两民主县政府。现豫皖苏解放区已共有五十八个县民主政府。自解放军控制平汉路两侧广大地区后，豫皖苏第五军分区即派地方武装一部，至郾城、临颍、舞阳三县边区积极清剿土蒋，支援该地原有人民自动组织之抗蒋自卫武装。当地群众斗争热情甚高，其自卫武装于二月初即自动加入我五军分区地方兵团，并要求早日建立民主政权。我五专署应人民之请，乃设立两新县府，以直接领导群众翻身运动。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖二十日电】解放军七日夜收复平汉路重要车站驻马店之役，对群众利益妥为保护。当夜该站适停有满载商货之火车一列，解放军立即派部队看守，次日经详细调查，并召开十多家转运公司和数百商人的大会，将车上货物逐一发给原主。商人们卸货后都自动向民主政府登记纳税。现该市虽在蒋机空袭威胁下，但市内秩序井然，照常营业。解放军某部进驻驻马店车站时，铁路两侧居民误为蒋匪出扰，纷纷离庄逃避，解放军当即进行抚慰解释，并妥为照顾离村群众撇下的财物牲畜。住路东赵庄的某排替房东李德仁代喂了猪和鸡鸭，并采桑喂蚕，临走时还留信告诉他。住在李德扬家的某部烧了他家一些草，临走时也留下粮食和信偿还房东。
    又讯：蒋匪机连日在驻马店市郊滥施扫射轰炸，九日击坏民营安大汽车公司等驶赴洁河途中的汽车四辆，十日又将三商运卡车辆击毁，商民损失甚巨。解放军某部得悉后，当即进行抚慰与救济。
