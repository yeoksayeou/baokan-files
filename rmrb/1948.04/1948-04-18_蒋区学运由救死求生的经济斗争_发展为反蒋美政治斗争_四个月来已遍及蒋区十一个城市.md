Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 14th: Comprehensive reports indicate that in the past four months, the just movement of students in the Chiang-controlled areas against hunger and for comprehensive public funding has developed to a considerable scale. According to incomplete statistics from Chiang-controlled newspapers and foreign news agencies, from late December of last year to early April of this year, the following 21 universities and colleges have partially or fully participated in this just struggle: Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Sino-French University, Chaoyang University, Teachers College, China University, Fu Jen Catholic University, North China College in Peiping; Nankai University, Peiyang University in Tianjin; Tangshan Institute of Technology in Tangshan; Fudan University, Tongji University in Shanghai; National Central University in Nanjing; Wuhan University in Wuchang; Hunan University in Changsha; Guangxi University in Guilin; Zhongzheng University in Nanchang; Chongqing University in Chongqing; and Sichuan University in Chengdu. The number of participating specialized schools has not been included. This accounts for more than one-third of the public and private universities in the Chiang-controlled areas (a total of 54 universities and colleges), spreading to eleven cities. Currently, this just movement continues to expand.

Last December, the first-year students of the judicial groups of Fudan University, Tongji University, Wuhan University, Central University, Hunan University, Guangxi University, Chaoyang University, and Sichuan University demanded the continuation of full public funding and jointly went on strike for a week starting on the 24th of that month. In mid-January, Peiyang University, Nankai University, and Tangshan Institute of Technology in Tianjin put forward the proposal for full public funding for the entire school. More than 2,000 students at Wuhan University went on strike for three days starting on January 23rd for this and for the demand to increase the food allowance for publicly funded students. In February, the slogan of striving for comprehensive public funding had spread to various parts of the Chiang-controlled areas. In early February, students from various universities in Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan jointly submitted two demands to the Chiang bandit Ministry of Education: that self-funded and semi-publicly funded students in "National" universities and colleges be converted to fully publicly funded students, and that the loan system for private universities and colleges be restored. On February 18th, Chaoyang University, Yenching University, and Sino-French University in Peiping jointly hosted reporters, putting forward, in addition to the demand for public funding, demands for public universities and colleges to increase regular expenses and teacher and staff salaries, and for private schools to increase subsidies and distribute supplies to teachers and staff. In March and April, the just movement against hunger and for comprehensive public funding flourished, with strikes and demonstrations taking place in various places, and further closely combining with the struggle of teachers and staff to improve their treatment. In mid-March, universities and colleges in Beijing, Nankai, Tangshan, and other places successively established "Joint Federation for Striving for Public Funding" and "Action Committee for Saving Education and Striving for Comprehensive Public Funding" as leading organizations for the struggle. On March 20th, the seven universities in Peiping and Tianjin sent a letter to the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek and the bandit Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, requesting the implementation of a public funding system for all universities and colleges in the entire Chiang-controlled area. On March 30th, the day after the opening of the Chiang bandit piglet National Assembly, teachers and students of Zhongzheng University in Nanchang, named after the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, launched a just strike against hunger and for full public funding treatment. Chongqing University also put forward a comprehensive public funding request. Because it was brazenly rejected by the Chiang bandits, the anti-hunger movement expanded further and became more closely integrated with the anti-oppression movement. On April 3rd, the seven universities in Peiping and Tianjin, for this reason and to protest the Chiang bandits' order to disband the North China Student Federation, jointly held an anti-oppression and anti-hunger strike. Teachers, staff, and workers of Beijing University, Tsinghua University, and other five universities immediately responded with strikes and work stoppages. Subsequently, students from North China College, Fu Jen Catholic University, China University, and other schools joined the strike. On the 9th, more than 8,000 students from various schools in Peiping City held a large-scale anti-oppression and anti-hunger parade and surrounded the Chiang bandit Peiping Pacification Headquarters for demonstrations all day. On the same day, more than a thousand students in Chengdu also held an anti-hunger parade, demanding that the Chiang bandits distribute food. On the 11th, 130 students from National Central University in Nanjing went on a hunger strike to protest the Chiang bandit Ministry of Education's rejection of the comprehensive public funding request. Although the Chiang bandits frantically suppressed them, arresting 130 people in Chengdu alone, the patriotic students still persisted in their struggle, persevered, and showed a tendency to expand.

The development of the student movement against hunger, for full public funding, and against oppression in the Chiang-controlled areas was sparked by the Chiang bandits' implementation of a policy of selling out the country, waging civil war, strangling culture, and starving the people. In March, the symposium on the education crisis in the Chiang-controlled areas held by teachers and students of Peiping Teachers College, Tsinghua University, Beijing University, and other schools pointed out that under the rule of the Chiang bandits, "there is no freedom to study academics, no freedom from hunger, and even less freedom from fear"; the deep education crisis in the Chiang-controlled areas and the starvation and poverty of teachers and students are all caused by the Chiang bandits "waging civil war and American imperialism's aggression." The student unions of Sino-French University, Yenching University, and other six universities also issued a letter to the public on February 24, condemning the Chiang bandits for this year's education funding "only accounting for 0.3 percent of their total budget." While implementing a hunger policy toward the academic circles in the Chiang-controlled areas, the Chiang bandit gang also implemented a traitorous, dictatorial, and enslaving education policy, and used special agents and bloody means to destroy all democratic freedoms in the academic circles. Precisely because of this, the anti-hunger struggle of students in the Chiang-controlled areas is bound to be linked to the struggle against oppression, anti-enslavement, and opposition to American imperialism, and to develop from an economic struggle for survival to a political struggle against Chiang and against America.

The anti-hunger and anti-oppression struggle of students in the Chiang-controlled areas has won the enthusiastic response and support of all oppressed classes in the Chiang-controlled areas, especially the parents of students and the teachers and staff of various schools. In mid-February, parents of students from various schools in Shanghai formed the "Shanghai Parents' Joint Association of Various Schools" to support the students' demand for comprehensive public funding, with more than 100,000 participants. On February 25th of the same month, more than a thousand primary and secondary school teachers in Shanghai held an anti-hunger parade, shouting the tragic slogan "Teachers want food to eat." More than ten universities and research institutions, including Beijing University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University, jointly proposed on March 1st to continue distributing two bags of flour per month. In early March, professors from Wuhan University sent representatives to Nanjing to petition for the same treatment as the Nanjing and Shanghai areas. Nearly a hundred professors from Anhui University sent representatives to Nanjing in mid-March to petition and implement an indefinite teaching strike. On March 27th, the Shanghai Joint Association for Rescuing the Education Crisis, the Neutral Education Research Association, the Primary School Teachers' Joint Training Association, and the Poor Students jointly hosted reporters and put forward ten appeals, including full public funding for public middle school and university students, increased teacher salaries, and rice distribution. The united struggle of students, professors, staff, and students and parents to fight hunger and ensure students' studies is the first time in the history of the Chinese student movement.

　　蒋区学运由救死求生的经济斗争
    发展为反蒋美政治斗争
    四个月来已遍及蒋区十一个城市
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合报导：在过去四个月中，蒋区学生反饥饿争取全面公费的正义运动已发展到相当巨大的规模。据蒋区报纸及外国通讯社的不完整材料统计，自去年十二月下旬至今年四月初，部分或全部参加这一正义斗争的有北平的北京、清华、燕京、中法、朝阳、师院、中国、辅仁、华北学院，天津的南开、北洋，唐山的唐工，上海的复旦、同济，南京的中大，武昌的武汉，长沙的湖南，桂林的广西，南昌的中正，重庆的重大，成都的四川等共二十一院校，专科学校参加者尚未计入。占蒋区公私立大学（总数五十四个院校）三分之一以上，遍及十一城市。目前此一正义运动正在继续扩大中。
    去年十二月复旦、同济、武汉、中央、湖南、广西、朝阳、四川八大学司法组一年级新生要求继续全部公费，于该月二十四日起联合罢课一周。一月中旬天津北洋、南开、唐工等校提出全校公费的主张，武汉大学学生二千余人更为此及要求提高公费生副食费而于一月二十三日起罢课三天。二月间争取全面公费口号已扩及蒋区各地。平、津、唐山三地各大学学生二月初联合向蒋匪教育部提出“国立”各院校自费生和半公费生均改为全公费，及恢复私立院校的贷金制度两项要求。北平朝阳、燕京、中法三大学二月十八日联合招待记者，除提出公费要求外，并提出公立院校提高经常费与教职员待遇，私校增加补助费、教职员配发实物等要求。三、四月间，反饥饿争取全面公费的正义运动蓬勃发展，各地纷纷罢课和举行示威，并进而与教职员争取改善待遇的斗争密切结合。三月中旬北京、南开、唐工等校纷纷成立“争取公费联合会”、“挽救教育争取全面公费行动委员会”作为斗争的领导机构。平、津七大学于三月二十日致函匪首蒋介石及匪教育部长朱家骅，要求对全蒋区各大学实施公费制度，三月三十日，即蒋匪猪仔国大开幕后一天，以匪首蒋介石名字命名的南昌中正大学师生爆发反饥饿争取全面公费待遇的正义罢课，重庆大学亦提出全面公费要求。因被蒋匪悍然拒绝，反饥饿运动更趋扩大，并与反压迫运动更密切地结合起来。四月三日平、津七大学为此并为抗议蒋匪下令解散华北学联，联合举行反压迫、反饥饿罢课，北京、清华等五大学教职员及工役立即罢教、罢工响应。其后华北学院、辅仁、中国等校学生纷纷加入罢课。九日平市各校学生八千余人举行反压迫、反饥饿大游行，并整日包围蒋匪北平行辕示威。同日成都千余学生亦举行反饥饿游行，要求蒋匪配给粮食。十一日南京中大学生一三○人绝食，抗议蒋匪教育部拒绝全面公费要求。各地蒋匪虽疯狂镇压，仅成都一地即逮捕一百三十人，但爱国学生仍坚持斗争，再接再厉，且有日趋扩大之势。
    蒋区学生反饥饿争取全面公费与反压迫运动的发展，是蒋匪实行卖国内战绞杀文化与饥饿政策所激起的。三月间北平师院、清华、北京等校师生所举行的蒋区教育危机座谈会，即指出：在蒋匪统治下“没有研究学术的自由，没有免于饥饿的自由，更没有免于恐惧的自由”；蒋区教育危机深重以及师生饥贫交迫，均系蒋匪“进行内战与美帝国主义侵略所造成”。中法、燕京等六大学学生自治会在二月廿四日发表告社会人士书中，亦谴责蒋匪今年教育经费“仅占其总预算的百分之零点三”。蒋匪帮在其对蒋区学界实施饥饿政策同时，并实施卖国独裁奴化的教育政策，又以特务血腥手段摧残学界的一切民主自由。正因为如此，蒋区学生的反饥饿斗争，必然与反压迫、反奴化与反对美帝侵略的斗争联结起来，由救死求生的经济斗争发展为反蒋反美的政治斗争。
    蒋区学生反饥饿反压迫斗争，已获得蒋区一切被压迫阶级群众，首先是学生家长与各校教职员的热烈响应与支持。沪市各校学生家长二月中旬已组成“上海市各校学生家长联合会”，支持学生的全面公费要求，参加者达十万人以上。同月二十五日，上海千余中小学教师举行反饥饿游行，高呼“教师要饭吃”的悲愤口号。北京、清华、南开等十余大学及研究机关，三月一日联合提出每月继续配售两袋面粉等要求。武汉大学教授三月初派代表赴南京请愿，争取与宁沪区同等待遇。安徽大学教授近百人，三月中旬派代表赴南京请愿，并实行无限期休教。三月二十七日上海抢救教育危机联合会、中立教育研究会、小学教师联合进修会与清贫学生联合招待记者，提出公立大中学生全面公费、增加教师待遇及配米等十项呼吁。学生、教授、职工以及学生与家长一致联合，为反饥饿保障学生学业而共同斗争，在中国学运史上，尚为第一次。
