　　【Our News】After each household self-reported, and after three public discussions and approvals, the class composition of the entire village of Shili Store in the Ninth District of Wu'an has been reviewed and approved by the village political committee and announced as a final decision. The eighty-four households that were previously designated as targets of struggle were also reclassified at the villagers' meeting. Mistakes were corrected, clarifying the chaotic situation of the past. The village has a total of 421 households. The results of the class division are: 140 poor peasant households, 125 new middle peasant households, 148 middle peasant households (including 4 well-to-do middle peasant households), 1 worker household, 3 handicraft laborer households, 1 small merchant household, 1 old rich peasant household, and 1 managing landlord household; there is also one household whose composition has not yet been determined due to complex historical circumstances.

　　After the initial class division, the village immediately carried out troop reorganization and democratic movements. During the movement, various reflections on the initial class division were collected at any time. After the troop reorganization came to an end, the masses were immediately mobilized to deliberate on re-dividing the classes, and to check whether there were any incorrectly designated class components in the past. On the evening of March 22nd, the poor peasant group held a meeting to review the shortcomings of the first class division. They realized that the main reasons why the first division was somewhat inappropriate were: 1. "We haven't organized yet. Some people's reports are not accurate. We are either afraid of people, or we can't break through the relationships and don't say anything." 2. "We are not very accurate with the conditions. Sometimes we only look at the land, sometimes we only look at life." Everyone expressed that they must take the lead this time. Then they discussed whether the determination of "struggle targets" in the village in the past was wrong. Someone said, "In the past, there was no standard. It was picking a gun from a pile of grain. The longer one was picked." "In the past, it was very simple. Whatever an activist said someone was, that's what they were!" Some said, "One decree at a time. According to that time, it would be good to investigate three generations; it would be wrong not to investigate three generations." The staff member then explained that investigating three generations was not a decree set by the government, but a mistake made by the lower-level cadres. Someone said, "That's right, investigating three generations is unreasonable; a person can be poor and rich seven times in ten years. Does it mean that if someone's father was feudal, they will be feudal for generations?" Then they discussed what feudalism is and what a landlord is. After the discussion, they found a few examples to classify; the staff member made some supplementary explanations on some specific issues (such as the components of those who lack labor and the personal components of families with different components, etc.).

　　Explain Class Policy Clearly, Publicly Correct Wrongly Classified Households

　　On the 23rd, from morning to night, the whole village was divided into five groups to divide classes. At the beginning, the staff member explained the classes again so that the middle and poor peasant masses understood our policy and grasped the policy themselves. This day was mainly for the households that were previously listed as "grades" (the previous targets of struggle were divided into first, second, and third grades) to report on the meeting: the family situation in the three years before the establishment of the Shili Store Democratic Government (1940) and the changes in land, population, and production relations over the years, the reasons and process for being struggled against, and what kind of components they were in each period. Each time a section was reported, a section was discussed, "changing bit by bit," and finally the current component was determined. At first, some of the people who reported were timid and spoke very unnaturally. Some of these people were honest farmers, who had not attended a meeting for more than a year after being listed as "grades"; the masses said to him: "Just follow the actual situation, whatever it is, that's what it is. Now, no one will be wronged, don't be afraid." After a few people were classified, they felt relieved. In the afternoon, almost all of these "struggled households" were the first to arrive at the meeting. In the morning, they were sitting in the corner of the room and dared not speak. In the afternoon, they chatted happily with everyone. This time, the discussion was more detailed than the previous class division. Each group had only a dozen or less than twenty households, and the discussion lasted all day. At the end, some groups also classified a few households that had not been classified in the first division because they were not at home; and put forward the problems in the first division for discussion.

　　After this self-reporting and discussion, the next evening, the Poor Peasants' League Committee and the Farmers' Association Committee held a joint meeting to review the newly classified components of the "struggled households"; the staff member still occupied the position of "dialing lamp pole" and assisted from the side. This review was very necessary; although the vast majority of the public discussions were correct, this review revealed that some of the reports were inaccurate, and the components were not accurately determined. Based on this situation, it was decided to give the decision-making power of the second class division to the plenary meeting of the Poor Peasants' League. On the evenings of the 25th and 26th, the Poor Peasants' League held two plenary meetings, discussing and approving the class of each household in the village one by one. More than 20 households in the village were corrected. In these three evenings and two meetings, the attitude of the Poor Peasants' League members, Poor Peasants' League Committee members, and Farmers' Association Committee members was more serious and fair. At the same time, it also showed that everyone was careful and vigilant against class enemies. For those of the exploiting class who had not worked enough years after being struggled against, they were resolutely not allowed to change their composition. On the 28th, the second list was posted. In the two days after the list was posted, the work team paid attention to understanding the masses' reflections on correcting the components of the "struggled households," and on the other hand, looked for the past "struggled households" to conduct individual talks or hold forums, let them open their hearts, and promoted the party's policies according to the new spirit.

　　Correcting Wrongly Determined Components Gives Production a Boost

　　In the past few days, there have been the following reflections on correcting wrongly determined components:

　　Poor Peasants - Initially, when discussing the correction in the poor peasant group meeting, after discussing the conditions of landlords and rich peasants, some people were somewhat discouraged for a while. They said listlessly, "Then there is not a single landlord in our street!" Then they said, "The middle peasants can't be touched either, where will the houses be filled from?" Some people deliberately exaggerated because they were unhappy: "Humph, the landlords have also become destitute!" Some people felt a little "suffocated" because they were struggled against in the past, and were not very comfortable. They were listless during the discussion. Some people also said, "The father's debt is repaid by the son; that land was not obtained through labor either, it's not wrong to investigate three generations." But gradually, the correct opinion prevailed: "In the past, we were sliding down the river and messing around, struggling randomly, and we didn't dare to get rich. We earned enough to eat for a day, and used whatever we were divided, and ate up all the grain; in the future, there will be no random struggles, and everyone will dare to develop." "We don't have enough food to eat, and we don't have a plow or an ox to use. In the past, we borrowed from You Wang's (a middle peasant) house, and he would give it to us after a word; after they were put on the 'grade,' we didn't dare to borrow anything, it's so inconvenient!" "Fu × (a middle peasant), his family also built the kiln from a young age with his brothers, and they didn't eat less bran cakes. They worked hard and earned some property, but they were determined to be a 'household' just because they were good at fighting with people! Who else would want to work hard?" A woman said, "Wang Shao Yi (a middle peasant) used to be the production director, leading women to spin and weave was very progressive. After he was struggled against, no one had the energy to spin flowers. In the mutual aid group, everyone was willing to go to the field with him, one person was worth half. After he was determined to be 'first class,' mutual aid became inconvenient." One who used to eat "struggle meals" (people called him "a pit that can't be filled") finally said: "In the future, I should still go to the field and work hard!"

　　Middle Peasants - Generally, they were relieved, knowing that they would not be struggled against in the future. "It's right for landlords and rich peasants to change their components, they should also have endured enough, it's good to work." "With that kind of struggle in the past, our middle peasant households would produce less." Everyone said, "It's only two days early or two days late, can we spare them! The suffering is also for others to endure, it's better to eat and drink and let it fall into our own stomachs." "If we make so many struggle households, we don't want them for troop expansion, our armed manpower is reduced; there are also fewer people to carry stretchers to the front line." "First and second class are not allowed to help each other, third class households can still participate in the mutual aid group, but they don't have the energy to work." "In the future, we should buy donkeys when we should buy donkeys, and we should work hard when we should work hard."

　　Households Being Struggled Against - Generally, they were happy. In talking with the staff members, some also complained, asking to speak, asking to restore democratic rights, asking to be able to move freely to go out to produce, and some also asked to return houses, land, and livestock.

　　Discuss and Approve in Batches, Then Review and Approve

　　After these days of deliberation, the masses' thoughts on correcting wrongly determined classes gradually matured. On the 30th, the villagers' meeting was held to approve the classes of the entire village and publicly correct the wrongly determined "struggle households." This time, each household in the village was discussed and approved in batches. The first batch was those whose results of the first two divisions were completely consistent. It was estimated that there would not be much problem, so they were divided into several categories according to their components, and their names were called one by one. After reading one category, everyone was asked if they had any opinions. If there were no opinions, it was passed as the original proposal. As a result, in this batch (273 households), only four households had someone raise an opinion, and after the masses' public discussion, it was still passed according to the original proposal, without any changes. The second batch was those who had multiple opinions in the first division and were not determined until the second time (25 households). The third batch was those who were determined in the first time and then changed in the second time (24 households). The fourth batch was those who did not participate in the class division for the first time because they were not at home (11 households). These three batches required more carefulness, so they took a longer time to discuss. In these three batches, five people had opinions. After discussion, three households were passed according to the original proposal, and two households were changed. The fifth batch was the middle and poor peasants who had been designated as "struggle households" in the past, which needed to be treated with caution, and also took a longer time to discuss. The sixth batch was the original landlords and rich people who had changed other components and those who had not changed, which needed to be treated with special caution, so the focus was placed on this batch, taking more time for detailed discussion. After a long discussion, as a result, among the four landlord and rich peasant households that were considered to have not changed their components during the second class division, only one household believed that they had not changed, and the other three households still remained as pending cases because the conditions needed to determine the components did not have enough evidence to prove. The conference resolved to submit it to the village political committee for investigation before making a decision. (After joint discussions by the village political committee, the Poor Peasants' League Committee, and the Farmers' Association Committee, two more households were decided, and one household still had a complex situation and no decision was made, and the investigation is continuing.) Finally, as a result of the class division, among the 84 households "in the grades," it was determined that there was one managing landlord household, one rich peasant household, 57 middle peasant households (including three well-to-do middle peasant households), seven new middle peasant households (including one new well-to-do middle peasant household), sixteen poor peasant households, one small merchant household, and one undetermined household.

　　Using this method of discussing in batches can concentrate attention and save time; and it allows the components of most people to be determined first, reducing the psychological burden, so the atmosphere of the meeting appears more lively and enthusiastic. The staff member paid attention to controlling the time, not spending too much time on the first few batches to exhaust the masses, and concentrating the masses' attention on the latter two batches. Because the first few batches were internal to the working class, and had been reviewed several times, there were no hidden class enemies inside. The latter two batches were to strictly distinguish between the working class and the exploiting class, and no one should be wrongly classified; it is not good to classify our own people to the enemy's side, and it is not good to classify the enemy to our side.

### 逐一公议通过再经审查批准　什里店三榜定成份

　　逐一公议通过再经审查批准
  　什里店三榜定成份
    【本报消息】武安九区什里店全村阶级成份，经过各户自报，三次公议，逐一讨论通过后；已经村政委员会审查批准公布，成为定案。过去被划为斗争对象的八十四户，也在村民大会上重新划了，错了的都改正过来，澄清了过去混沌状态。全村共四百二十一户，划阶级结果：贫农一百四十户，新中农一百二十五户，中农一百四十八户（其中有富裕中农四户），工人一户，手工业劳动者三户，小商贩一户，旧富农一户，经营地主一户；还有一户因历史情况复杂，还没有决定成份。
    该村经过初划阶级，紧接着就进行了整编队伍和民主运动。在运动中随时搜集对初划阶级的各种反映。到整编队伍告一段落后，就立即发动群众酝酿再划阶级，并检查一下过去有没有错订成份的。三月廿二日晚，贫农团各小组开会检讨了第一次划阶级有啥毛病，认识到第一次划的还有些不相当的主要原因是：一、“咱们还没组织起来，有些人报的不确实，咱不是害怕人家，就是打不破情面，不吭气。”二、“条件咱还拿不太准，有时候光看地土了，有时候光看生活了。”大家就表示这一次一定要起带头作用。接着就讨论过去这个村定“斗争对象”有没有定错的。有人说：“过去就没个标准，是谷堆里面挑枪杆，那根长一点就拣那根。”“过去简单得很，积极分子说谁是个啥谁就是个啥！”有的说：“一时一个法令，要按那时候，兴查三代，就不错；不兴查三代，就错了。”工作员这时解释了查三代并不是政府定的法令，是下面干部弄错了。有人就说：“可不是哩，查三代就是不合理；一个人十年也有七贫七富的，人家爷是封建就辈辈是封建？”接着就讨论了啥叫封建，啥叫地主。讨论后，就找几个例子划了；工作员对一些具体问题（如缺乏劳力的成份和不同样家庭成份的个人成份等）又作了些补充说明。
    再讲阶级明政策　公开订正错划户
    二十三日，从早晨到夜晚，全村分五大组进行划阶级，开头工作员再讲阶级，使中贫农群众都明了我们的政策，并自己掌握住政策。这一天主要是过去被列入“等次”的户（过去斗争对象分为头、二、三等）在会上自报：什里店民主政府成立（一九四○年）前三年的家庭情况和历年土地、人口、生产关系的变化，被斗争的原因和经过，每段时间内自己是啥成份。每报一段，公议一段，“一圪节一圪节变”，最后定出现在的成份。最初自报的人还有些怯，说话很不自然，这些人有的本是老实农民，列上“等次”后一年多没参加过开会；群众就对他说：“按实际来就行，是啥就是啥，现在冤屈不了一个人啦，不用怕。”划过几个人之后，他们心就放宽了。下午各组到会最早的差不多都是这些“被斗户”。上午他们还坐在屋角落里不敢说话，下午也就很愉快的跟大家攀谈了。这一回比前些天划阶级时讨论得更详细，每一大组都只有十几户不到二十户，就讨论了一整天。有的组最后又把初划时因为不在家而没有划的几户划了；并且把第一次划过的提出问题加以讨论。
    经过这次自报、讨论之后，第二天晚上贫农团委员和农会委员开联席会，把“被斗户”新划的成份作了一次审查；工作员仍居于“拨灯棍”地位，从旁辅助。这次审查很必要；虽然公议的绝大部分是对的，可是经这一查又查出一些报的不确实的，成份也就定的不准确了。根据这情况，就决定把第二次划阶级的决定权归于贫农团全体会议。廿五、廿六日晚，贫农团开了两晚上全体会议，把全村的阶级逐户讨论、通过，全村中有廿多户被改正了。在这三个晚上的两个会议里，表现了贫农团员、贫农团委员和农会委员的态度是比较更认真的，比较公正的。同时也表现出大家对阶级敌人是小心警惕的。对于剥削阶级被斗后劳动不够年限的，就坚决不让改变成份。廿八日，贴出第二榜。出榜后两天里，工作组一方面注意了解群众对纠正“被斗户”成份的反映，一方面找过去的“被斗户”作个别谈话或开座谈会，放开他们谈心，并按新精神宣传党的政策。
    改正错订成份生产就有劲头
    这几天里，对纠正错订成份有以下这些反映：
    贫农——最初在贫农团小组会上酝酿纠正时，讨论了地主、富农的条件后，有的人一时有些泄气。没劲的说：“那咱街就没一个地主啦！”接着就说：“中农又不能动，房子从那里填？”还有的因为心里不如意，就故意夸大其词的说：“哼，地主也变成赤贫啦！”有人是觉得过去斗错了，心里有点“窝囊”，不大舒展，讨论时没精打彩的。还有人说：“父债子还；他那地也不是劳动得来的，查三代也不算怎么错。”但渐渐还是正确的意见占了上风：“过去溜河乱蛋，乱斗，咱也不敢发家，挣一天吃一天，分上东西就用了，打点粮食吃个净；这往后，就不会乱斗了，谁也敢发了。”“咱粮食不够吃，没犁没牛使，过去去有旺（一个中农）家借，说一声就给；把人家上了等次，咱就不敢去借东西啦，多不方便！”“傅×（中农）人家也是从小弟兄们上窑置的时光，也没少吃糠窝子，劳动得好挣了些产业，就是好跟人打架就定成‘户子’啦！别人谁还想劳动？”一个妇女说：“王绍夷（中农）过去当生产主任，领导妇女纺织很进步，斗了他以后，谁纺花也没劲啦。在互助组，谁也愿意跟他一块去地，一个人顶个半。把他定了“头等”，互助也不方便啦。”一个过去吃“斗争饭”的，（人家叫他“填不满的坑”）最后也说：“往后还是好好下地受吧！”
    中农——一般的都放了心，知道以后斗不到自己头上了。“地主富农变成份也对，人家也该熬出来了，劳动就好。”“过去那样斗法，咱中农户就少生产了”。都说：“也不过迟两天早两天吧，还能饶了哩！受也是给人家受哩，不如吃喝吃喝落到自己肚里。”“弄这么多斗争户，扩军也不要他们，咱武装人力少了；上前线抬担架人也少了。”“头、二等不许互助，三等户还能参加互助组，可是劳动起来也没劲。”“往后该买驴就买驴，该用劲干就用劲干。”
    被斗户——一般都是高兴的。在和工作员谈话时也有人诉了些苦，要求说话，要求恢复民主权利，要求能自由行动出去生产，有的也要求退还房、地、牲口。
    分批讨论通过再经审查批准
    经过这几天酝酿之后，群众纠正错定阶级的思想逐渐成熟，三十日就开了村民大会通过全村阶级，并公开纠正错定的“斗争户”。这次是把全村各户分批讨论通过的。第一批是前两次划的结果完全一致的，估计不会有多大问题，就按成份再分成几类，一一呼名，念完一类就问大家有意见没有，没有就作为通过。结果这一批（二百七十三户）只有四户有人提出意见，而经群众公议结果，仍是照原案通过，没有一个更动。第二批是第一次有多种意见未能确定到第二次才确定了的（二十五户）。第三批是第一次确定了到第二次又变更的（二十四户）。第四批是第一次因不在家未参加划阶级的（十一户）。这三批需要比较仔细些，就拿较长的时间讨论。这三批里有五个人有意见，讨论结果，三户照原案通过，两户改变了。第五批是过去曾定为“斗争户”的中、贫农等，需要慎重，也拿出较长的时间讨论。第六批是原为地富已改变其他成份和仍未改变的，需要特别慎重，就要重点放在这一批上，拿更多时间详细讨论。讨论了很久，结果，第二次划阶级时认为未改变成份的四户地主、富农中，只有一户认为确未改变，其他三户因为判定成份需要的条件没有足够的证据证明，仍留作悬案，大会决议提交村政委员会调查后再作前后决定。（村政委员会、贫农团委员会和农会委员会联合讨论之后，又决定了两户，有一户情况复杂，仍未作出决定，正继续调查。）最后划阶级的结果，“在等次”的八十四户中，确定经营地主一户，富农一户，中农五十七户（内有富裕中农三户），新中农七户（其中有新富裕中农一户），贫农十六户，小商贩一户，未确定的一户。
    用这样分批讨论的办法，可以集中注意力，节省时间；而且让大部分人的成份先确定了，心理上减轻了负担，所以会场空气就显得比较活泼、热烈。工作员注意到了掌握时间，不使在前几批上费时间太多把群众拖疲了，而使群众的注意力集中在后两批上。因为前几批是劳动阶级内部的，而且已经几经审查，里面并没有隐藏的阶级敌人。后两批则是要严格划清劳动阶级和剥削阶级的，万不能划错一个人；把自己人划到敌人方面去不好，把敌人划到自己这边也不好。
