    Jilu Yu No. 4 Sub-district Loans Grain and Funds to Help Disaster Victims Engage in Production for Self-Salvation
    [Jilu Yu News] No. 4 Sub-district Loans Grain and Funds to Organize Production to Overcome the Famine: Due to the looting and destruction by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, famine has occurred in areas such as Gaoling and Changyuan. The democratic government has now allocated 700,000 jin of miscellaneous grains and 80 million Jilu Yu currency to counties such as Gaoling, Changyuan, Weinan, Quhe, Jun, and Hua for relief. To support production, loans of 10,000 yuan per person are given to women who can spin and weave, and cloth sales permits are issued. When buying and selling cloth, those with sales permits have priority, and the government purchases the cloth at a high price. Now, women are actively spinning and weaving, and the market in Jingdian is crowded with sellers of cloth every day. After loans were given to the disaster-stricken masses in Changyuan, the men organized themselves to buy grain in places where it was cheap and transport it to the local area for sale, earning a considerable amount of money. The masses in Jun County are about to organize themselves to mine coal, and the government is preparing to purchase it to provide the masses with opportunities to earn money and solve their livelihood difficulties. Loans are given to small business operators so they can make well ropes, produce saltpeter, alkali, and willow baskets. For widowed, orphaned, and disabled individuals without labor power, grain is used to provide relief. In villages with mild disasters, the people's livelihood difficulties are solved through the distribution of fruits. In terms of specific organization and leadership, the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the bank are responsible for supporting and purchasing to maintain stable prices. County and district working cadres are responsible for leading the grain and fund lending, and in the villages, old village cadres and disaster-stricken masses organize disaster relief committees to lend grain and funds through a self-reporting and public discussion approach, prioritizing the poorest masses.

    【冀鲁豫消息】四分区贷粮贷款，组织生产渡荒由于蒋匪的抢掠与破坏，在高陵、长垣等地区，造成了灾荒，民主政府现已拨给高陵、长坦、卫南、曲河、浚、滑等县杂粮七十万斤，冀钞八万万元以作救济。为了支持生产，贷款给能纺花织布的妇女们每人一万元，并发给售布证，买卖布时拿出售布证就有优先权，由政府高价收买。现在妇女们积极纺织，井店市上每天卖布者都是拥挤不堪。贷款给长垣的受灾群众后，男人们组织起来到粮食贱的地方买粮，运输到本地出卖，也赚不少的钱。浚县的群众将要织组起来推煤，政府准备收买，以供群众赚钱解决生活困难。贷款给小经营者，他们可以打井绳、制火硝、碱、柳条筐等。对鳏寡孤独无劳动力的群众，用粮食救济他们。受灾轻的村庄，从分配果实中解决群众生活困难。在具体组织领导方面，由工商局银行负责支持与收买保持物价平稳。县区工作干部负责领导贷粮贷款，村里以老村干与受灾群众组织救灾委员会，用自报公议的方式贷粮和贷款，先贷给最贫苦的群众。
