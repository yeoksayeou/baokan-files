Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th: Having been liberated, farmers in Northeast China are actively preparing for spring plowing by purchasing livestock in large quantities and resolving issues such as fodder. In Lalin County, Songjiang Province, men, women, and children are all weaving mats, with income reaching over 400 million yuan (each yuan equivalent to 50 yuan of Kuomintang currency in the interior), and the county's livestock and fodder problems have been largely resolved. In the central village of Mengjiagang District, Huanan County, Hejiang Province, sideline production began last winter. The income from hauling wood with horse-drawn sleds alone reached 12 million yuan, with each of the 80 households in the village receiving an average of 150,000 yuan. Among them, seven landlord households, due to their diligent production, each purchased one or even two heads of livestock. Farmers in Banshi Township, Hunchun County, Jilin Province, organized coal mining to prepare to buy a head of livestock for each of the 260 households in the township, mining 150 tons of coal in ten days. The masses in various townships in the western district of Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, also purchased more than 150 horses through wood hauling, with an average of one horse for every four to five hectares of land in the district. In addition to organized sideline production, various regions are also exchanging the fruits of struggle for livestock. Jinhe District, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, exchanged gold, silver, and surplus grain for more than 100 head of livestock, and now every household in the district has a horse. The masses in Xinxing Village, Muguan County, Songjiang Province, fairly distributed all the fodder obtained through struggle, with each horse in the village receiving 1,400 jin of straw and 6 dou of soybeans. In addition, various regions have also purchased livestock in large quantities with funds allocated by the government to poor peasants. The trade bureaus of various provinces and counties are finding ways to assist the masses in regulating livestock. Liaobei Province, which has a large number of cattle and horses, has purchased 2,000 head of cattle and horses on behalf of Heilongjiang Province. Yanshou, Shangzhi, Shuangcheng, and other counties in Songjiang Province purchased more than 1,700 horses from Harbin. In terms of fodder regulation, the Heilongjiang Provincial Trade Bureau has allocated more than 1 million jin of bean cake to various counties, and the Nenjiang Province has also allocated 500 tons of bean cake. The liberated farmers in various provinces are taking extra care of the livestock they have obtained, building new stables, preventing horse plague, and establishing horse protection committees, mobilizing and organizing veterinarians, and promoting careful feeding and careful use. Hujia Wobao in the suburbs of Harbin recently held a large horse parade, rewarding farmers who carefully fed their horses.
