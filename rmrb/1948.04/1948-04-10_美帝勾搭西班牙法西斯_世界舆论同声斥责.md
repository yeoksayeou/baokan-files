Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Comprehensive report: The US House of Representatives passed a most shameful resolution on the 30th of last month, including the fascist Franco government in the "Marshall Plan." This action immediately aroused a chorus of condemnation from progressive public opinion around the world. Soviet newspapers pointed out: "US imperialism has been trying every means to turn Spain into an American military base and colluding with Spanish fascism." The British Communist Party's "Daily Worker" said: All British people with a sense of shame will hate and despise the US House of Representatives' resolution, and the labor movement will never tolerate the policy of supporting Franco with dollars. The French Communist Party's "L'Humanité" said: The Spanish people will express indignation at the US House of Representatives' resolution, considering it "hostile to their struggle for freedom and an insult to their cause of liberation." The French "Franc-Tireur" said: The US House of Representatives' resolution is a "disgrace." The Italian Communist Party's "L'Unità" said: "Aid to Franco is the tombstone of the Marshall Plan." "In order to find accomplices for its anti-Soviet and anti-people activities, the United States is willing to take even murderers and villains, and Franco is one of them." The American Communist Party's "Daily Worker" said: "Inviting Franco to participate in the Marshall Plan is to acknowledge the complete war and fascist goals of the Truman and Marshall doctrines." The US afternoon newspaper pointed out: "For those who recognize Franco as Hitler's vanguard and ally, this resolution has aroused their anger." Even the reactionary factions in Britain and France, fearing popular opposition and the complete exposure of their deception of the people through the "Marshall Plan," deliberately expressed surprise and dissatisfaction. The British Labour Party's International Secretary, Healey, said at the end of last month: "Eight days ago, the Labour Party and twelve other socialist parties in Western Europe formally protested against the inclusion of Spain in the Marshall Plan." A British Foreign Office spokesman also made a similar statement. The French Foreign Ministry expressed deep "surprise" on the 30th. Official newspapers in Denmark, Belgium, Norway, and other countries also published comments. The Danish newspaper said: "If Hitler were still alive, he could one day excitedly receive a share of Marshall's aid." Under the pressure of global public opinion's opposition and the reluctance of Western European reactionaries to immediately express their approval, the US Senate and House Joint Committee had to revoke this resolution of the House of Representatives on the 1st.

　　美帝勾搭西班牙法西斯
  　世界舆论同声斥责
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合报导：美众院于上月卅日通过一件最可耻的决议，将法西斯佛朗哥政府列入“马歇尔计划”中。此举立即激起了世界进步舆论的一片痛斥声。苏联各报指出：“美帝一直在想尽方法把西班牙变成美国军事基地，与西班牙法西斯主义狼狈为奸。”英共的“工人日报”说：凡是具有廉耻之心的一切英国人民，对美众院的决议，均将憎恶厌恨，劳工运动将永不容忍以美元支持佛朗哥之政策。法共“人道报”说：西班牙人民将对美众院决议表示愤恨。认为它“是敌视他们争取自由的斗争，并且是侮辱他们的解放事业。”法“义勇军报”说：美众院的决议是一种“耻辱”。意共“团结报”说：“援助佛朗哥是马歇尔计划的墓碑”。“美国为了找寻它底反苏反人民的帮手，即使是杀人犯和恶棍也要，佛朗哥就是其中的一个。”美共“工人日报”说：“邀请佛朗哥参加马歇尔计划，就是承认全部杜鲁门与马歇尔主义底战争与法西斯目的。”美下午报指出：“对于认识到佛朗哥是希特勒的先锋和同盟者的人们说来，这一决议引起了他们的愤怒。”甚至连英、法两国反动派，也因慑于人民的反对，及恐惧将因此完全揭穿他们以“马歇尔计划”向人民进行的欺骗，因而故意表示惊讶与不满。英工党国际书记赫利于上月底说：“在八天以前，工党和西欧其他十二个社会党曾正式抗议将西班牙纳入马歇尔计划。”英外交部发言人亦作类似表示。法外交部于三十日深表“惊讶”。丹、比、挪等国官方报纸也纷纷发表评论，丹麦新闻报说：“假如希特勒还活着，他也可在某一天，会兴奋地去领取马歇尔的一份援助。”在世界舆论同声反对及西欧反动派不敢遽表赞同的压力下，美参众两院联席委员会不得不于一日撤消众院这一决议。
