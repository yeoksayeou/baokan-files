Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 22nd: Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave important instructions at a meeting of the Yichuan and Yanchuan Districts Work Team in Suide in mid-March regarding the correction of deviations and party consolidation in the land reform. Comrade Zhongxun pointed out: At present, during the spring plowing season, land reform work should be suspended. However, problems that were incorrectly handled in the past should not be put aside and must continue to be thoroughly corrected. Some people say, "We are afraid of hindering spring plowing, let's talk about it later." This is wrong. If mistakes are not corrected, the masses will doubt our policies, which will be detrimental to production. Then he pointed out: Some areas have not seriously corrected their mistakes, or the corrections are not thorough. Some comrades have several ideological problems that have not been resolved. They are still thinking, "Left is better than right," but they don't know that right is opportunism, and "left" is also opportunism. Neither is Marxism-Leninism, and both are harmful to the revolution. Some comrades use the excuse of "mass sentiment" and "mass demands" and are unwilling to correct mistakes. In fact, the party's policy must represent the long-term interests of the majority of the masses and cannot follow the temporary interests of some of the masses. That is called tailism, not "mass viewpoint," but some comrades often find it difficult to understand. Correcting "left" is often more difficult than correcting "right," and the leadership must take a very firm attitude. Some comrades also say, "Correcting 'left' will lead to 'right' again." This is also wrong. We have the Outline Land Law and clear policies for implementing land reform. As long as we resolutely implement them, there will be no right-leaning errors. At the beginning of this land reform work, the leadership did not clarify some issues, and the responsibility lies with the leadership. However, the Northwest Bureau quickly corrected many major problems, such as no longer dividing equally in old areas, not touching middle peasants in principle, and abolishing corporal punishment, all of which have clear regulations. If our comrades do not seriously correct their mistakes, they must examine themselves. Some comrades say, "The turn cannot be too sharp, it must be turned slowly." They are even afraid to openly explain the policies to the masses. This is also wrong. Since the policies have deviated, they must be turned around immediately, without ambiguity or delay. Mistakes must be corrected. There can be appropriate steps in the specific correction of errors, but this does not mean hesitation or perfunctoriness. Any hesitation or perfunctoriness will damage the seriousness of the policy. In some places, the correction of deviations is general, and the problems that were wrongly handled in the past, the people who were wrongly struggled against, have not been dealt with individually. In places where there is no such practical work, on the surface, there are not many problems, or there are simply no problems. In fact, these are often the places where there are the most problems, but some of our comrades are blinded by complacency and have not seriously examined their work, or they do not have the courage to face the mistakes in their work, and some even deliberately conceal them, which is even more wrong. The most valuable quality of us communists is loyalty and honesty. Comrade Zhongxun also pointed out: Some areas only have work team comrades working alone when correcting mistakes and still do not consult with the masses to solve them, making the masses indifferent, isolating themselves, and the problem remains unresolved. "Many of our comrades have still not learned the style of mass work," he said. "Without mass work, no work can be done well, and the same goes for correcting deviations. We must publicize the party's policies to the masses well, and after the masses have deliberated and discussed it themselves, they will recognize what has been done wrong, and everyone will come up with ideas and solutions. We should face the majority of the masses, and we must persuade the part of the masses who do not understand the policies, and we must also explain to those who have been wrongly struggled against. Simple and hasty methods are wrong." Afterwards, he mentioned the solutions to several specific problems in correcting mistakes: those who have been wrongly classified should be rehabilitated, and the land and property that were wrongly taken from the peasants who were wrongly classified as landlords and rich peasants should be resolutely returned. If the land has already been planted by the people who have been allocated it, the land ownership should be clarified now and determined to be returned to the original owner, but whoever plants it this year will harvest it, and after the harvest, the planter will pay appropriate rent to the original owner, or the two families will pay grain according to their composition, and return the land; property that has been dispersed, sold, or consumed should be compensated with other fruits of struggle; if it is temporarily impossible to compensate, it can be treated as a loan and returned regularly; a few that are indeed difficult to repay can be handled through mediation. As for a part of the land that the well-to-do middle peasants have voluntarily adjusted, there is no need to go back and move it after it has been distributed. Correcting deviations does not mean completely negating everything in the past. (⑴⑵)

Speaking of the work of consolidating the Party, Comrade Xi Zhongxun pointed out that the work of consolidating the Party in the current land reform movement has been done very little in various places, and many places have not even started. However, there are indeed many problems in the Party and among cadres in the rural areas of the border region, as well as in rural work, and there are also serious problems. Party consolidation must continue, which is the key to improving and enhancing all rural work. He mentioned that Comrade Ma Wenrui (Director of the Organization Department of the Northwest Bureau) recently summarized the experience of rectifying a Party branch in the third district and fourth township of Wuqi. This experience mainly illustrates three points: The main problem of the Party in the rural areas of the border region is not the problem of impure organization (that branch did not have landlords or rich peasant components), but the problem of ideology and work style. Party members and cadres in the branch have a serious phenomenon of being divorced from the masses, do not do mass work, and only use administrative orders, so they cannot play a core leading role. Therefore, the focus of Party consolidation should be on transforming the ideology and work style of Party members and cadres, and on changing the leadership style of the branch, so that the Party is closely linked with the masses. Party consolidation should adopt a combination of inner-Party democracy and extra-Party democracy, and it is even more necessary to clarify policies inside and outside the Party in advance and make full preparations so that both sides are fully ideologically prepared. This summary can be applied to other old areas in the border region. Comrade Zhongxun emphasized that the phenomenon of some rural Party members in the border region controlling villages and being divorced from the masses is very common and very serious. Party members do not do mass work, do not consult with the masses, and do not publicize various tasks and problems in the countryside to the masses. When something happens, a few Party members hold secret meetings, make secret decisions, and use administrative orders to tell the masses to do it. It would be a big mistake to call this approach leadership. In this way, the Party and the masses do not communicate, and even if the decision of the branch or group is correct and for the benefit of the masses, it is still divorced from the masses without mass work. The people in Suide and other places call Party members "branches" and suspect "secret meetings," which is the reason. Most rural Party members also do not know that doing mass work is the primary task of Party members, and only know how to "set an example" and "take the lead" in burdens or other work. In fact, without contact with the masses, this "lead" cannot be taken. Therefore, Party members and branches cannot play a role, which is a very big matter of principle. Because of the existence of such a work style, ordinary Party members isolate themselves, either ordering the masses or working alone. Some comrades regard themselves as special and leave the masses. They are not supervised by the masses, and their work style is getting worse and worse. A few bad elements take advantage of this loophole to form a gang, control everything, and ride on the heads of the masses. Without transforming this work style of rural Party members and branches and changing the relationship with the masses, the Party still cannot play a role, and Party consolidation is still equal to no consolidation. He continued: Among the rural Party members in the border region, there are indeed a number of bad Party members, some of whom are class alien elements, but most of them are peasants, but their work style is very bad. Some are old Party members who have made contributions in the revolution in the past, but they have also done a lot of bad things. For example, the Huo brothers in a township in Yichuan District were very brave and resolute in fighting the enemy, but they were very bad to the masses. No one in the surrounding villages said he was good. Being so seriously divorced from the masses, even if they have made contributions in the past, they must be cleaned up. Generally speaking, Party consolidation should still focus on education and transformation. The entire process of Party consolidation is also an educational process, and the center of it is to teach Party members how to do mass work and have a mass viewpoint. Contact with the masses must stipulate certain systems. For example, in the old areas and central areas, the Party branches and Party members are open, the rural Party groups and branches do not hold secret meetings, and the masses can be invited to listen to general rural work issues. Each Party member should be specifically designated to contact certain masses, often publicize the Party's propositions to them, help them solve problems, consult with them on problems, unite them, and jointly implement the common resolutions of the township people. Comrade Zhongxun criticized Party committees at all levels for neglecting the work of the branches for a long time, not inspecting, not studying, and not giving specific guidance. From now on, Party committees above the district level should regard the specific study, guidance, and improvement of branch work as their regular and important work. Comrade Zhongxun said that the method of Party consolidation in Pingshan can be done in this way everywhere. He also proposed that now the branches and group meetings in the old areas are inviting the masses to participate in discussions on production, disaster relief, and general rural work issues, first communicating with each other, and then carrying out Party consolidation. He especially mentioned that Party consolidation work should not be stopped, but it should not be rushed, and there should be strong cadres to lead it. Each county can effectively do the Party consolidation work of one or several branches in the recent months, gain experience, and then expand it in waves. It is required that Party committees in various places make practical plans based on the specific situation in their localities. He also proposed that Party consolidation is not just about expelling a few bad Party members, but also about absorbing outstanding peasant elements into the Party in mass struggles such as land reform and the struggle against the enemy, so that new blood is added to the Party. At present, the ratio of the number of Party members in the border region to the population is still very small. It is possible and necessary for the general villages to double the number of existing Party members. Finally, Comrade Zhongxun also talked about the issue of rural unity. Some people say, "Land reform and correction of deviations have made the countryside disunited, and there are more and more problems." This view is not appropriate. There were originally many problems in the countryside, but they were exposed in the land reform. It is good that they are exposed now, so that we can see clearly and start to solve them. However, the thorough solution of these problems must be achieved in Party consolidation and the development of rural democratic work.

　　习仲勋同志指示义延两区工作团
  　严肃进行纠偏整党
    【新华社西北二十二日电】中共西北局书记习仲勋同志，三月中旬在绥德义合、延家川两区工作团会议上，对土地改革中的纠偏和整党工作曾有重要指示。仲勋同志指出：目前春耕期间，土改工作应当停止。但对过去错误处理的问题则不应搁下，必须继续彻底改正。有人说：“怕妨碍春耕，过后再说吧。”这是不对的，有错不改，群众就会对我们的政策发生怀疑，反于生产不利。接着他指出：有一些地区还没有认真的改正错误，或则改正得不彻底。有些同志有好几个思想问题没有解决。他们还想着：“左比右好”，却不知道右了是机会主义，“左”了也是机会主义，都不是马列主义，都对革命有害。有些同志借口“群众情绪”、“群众要求”，不愿改正错误，其实党的政策必须代表大多数群众的长远利益，不能跟着部分群众暂时的利益跑，那叫做尾巴主义，不叫做“群众观点”，但是有些同志往往不容易想通。纠左往往比纠右还难些，必须领导上采取十分坚决的态度。又有些同志说：“纠左会又弄成右”，这也是不对的。我们有了土地法大纲，有了贯彻土地改革的各项明确的政策，只要坚决执行就不会有什么右的错误。在这次土改工作开始之初，领导上对有些问题未曾弄明确，这个责任在领导上。但西北局很快即改正了许多重大问题，象老区不再平分，中农原则上不动，废止肉刑等都有明确规定。我们同志还不认真改正错误，那就要检讨自己。有些同志说：“弯子不能转的太猛，要慢慢转。”连政策也不敢公开向群众讲，这也是不对的。既然政策弄偏了，就要立即转过来，绝不能含糊，绝不能拖。错了的一定要改正，具体改正错误中可以有适当步骤，但绝不等于犹豫敷衍，任何犹豫敷衍都有损政策的严肃性。有些地方则是一般的纠偏，没有把过去弄错的问题，斗错的人家，逐一的具体处理。没有这些实际工作的地方，表面看，问题不多，或者简直没有什么问题。其实往往正是那里问题最多，只是我们有些同志被自满情绪蒙着眼，没有认真检查自己的工作，或者没有勇气正视自己工作的错误，其中有的甚至故意隐瞒，那更是不对的。我们共产党人最可贵的品质就是忠诚与老实。仲勋同志又指出：有些地区在改正错误时只是工作团同志单独去作，仍然不会跟群众去商量去解决，弄得群众冷漠，自己孤立，问题依旧解决不了。“我们许多同志仍然没有学会群众工作作风”，他说：“不会群众工作，任何工作都作不好，纠偏也一样，我们必须向群众很好的宣传党的政策，经过群众自己酝酿讨论，使群众认识哪些是弄错了，大家出主意，想出解决办法。应该面向大多数群众，对还不了解政策的一部分群众要去说服，对被斗错的也要进行解释。简单草率的办法是不对的。”其后他提及改正错误中的几个具体问题的解决办法：被错订成份的一律平反，农民被错订地主富农斗了的，要坚决退还错动了的土地、财产。如土地已由分得人种上了，地权应在现在就判清，确定归还原主，但今年谁种谁收，收割后由种地人给原主交纳适当的租子，或两家按成分粮，并退还土地；财产已分散、变卖或消耗了的，应以其他斗争果实补偿；暂时无法补的可作为借贷，定期归还；少数确实难以偿还的，可调解处理。至于富裕中农确实自愿调剂出来的一部分土地，已经分配了的不必再去翻动，纠偏不等于把过去一切全部否定。（⑴⑵）
    讲到整党工作问题，仲勋同志指出：这次各地土地改革运动中整党工作做得很少，甚至许多地方还没有着手。但边区农村党和干部中间，以及农村工作中间确实存在很多问题，而且还有严重的问题。整党仍必须继续进行，这是改进和提高农村一切工作的关键。他提到最近马文瑞同志（西北局组织部长）总结了吴旗三区四乡整顿一个党的支部的经验，这个经验主要说明三点：即边区农村党主要的问题不是组织不纯的问题（那个支部并没有地主富农成份），而是思想、作风的问题。支部党员干部有严重的脱离群众现象，不做群众工作，只会行政命令一套办法，因而不能起核心领导作用。故整党重点应放在改造党员干部的思想作风上，转变支部领导方式上，使党与群众密切联系。整党要采取党内民主与党外民主结合办法，更需要在党内外事先讲清政策，作充分的酝酿，使两方面都有充分的思想准备。这个总结可适用于边区其他老区。仲勋同志着重指出：边区一部分农村党员把持乡村，脱离群众的现象很普遍，很严重。党员不做群众工作，不和群众商量办事，农村中各种工作各种问题也不向群众作宣传，有了事情就是少数党员开秘密会，秘密决定，用行政命令叫群众去做，如果把这种作法叫做领导那是大错特错。这样党和群众就不通气，即使支部或小组的决定是正确的并为群众打算，但没有群众工作仍然脱离群众。绥德一带群众叫党员做“支部”，怀疑“暗部会”就是这个道理。大多数农村党员也都不知道做群众工作是党员第一任务，只知道在负担或其他工作中“起模范”“带头”，其实没有和群众联系，这个“头”也是带不起来的。因此党员、支部不能起作用，这是一个很大的原则性的问题。因为存在着这样的作风，一般党员把自己孤立起来，不是命令群众便是单独的干。有的同志则自视特殊，便和群众离开了。他们不受群众监督，作风越弄越坏，少数坏分子便借着这个空子结成一把子，把持一切，骑在群众头上。不改造农村党员支部的这种作风和转变群众关系，党仍然起不了作用，整党仍然等于没有整。他继续说：边区农村党员中，确实有一批坏党员，其中有一些是阶级异己分子，但大部分都是农民，不过作风很坏。有些是老党员，过去革命中有功，但坏事也做得很多。象义合区一乡霍氏弟兄打敌人很勇敢坚决，对群众则很坏，周围村庄没有一个人不说他坏。脱离群众如此严重，虽然过去有功，也必须清洗。一般说整党仍然要以教育改造为主，整个整党工作过程也就是一个教育过程，其中心就是教会党员做群众工作，有群众观点。联系群众要规定若干制度。如在老区、中心区党的支部和党员均公开，农村党小组和支部不开秘密会，一般乡村工作问题可以请群众旁听，要具体指定每个党员和一定群众联系，经常向他们宣传党的主张，帮助他们解决问题，和他们商量问题，团结他们，一同执行乡村人民共同的决议。仲勋同志批评各级党委长时期忽视支部的工作，不检查，不研究，不具体指导。此后区以上党委应把具体研究、指导、提高支部工作当为自己经常的重要工作。仲勋同志说：平山整党的方法各地都可以这样去做。他并提出：现在老区支部，小组会议都请群众参加讨论生产救灾和一般乡村工作问题，先彼此通气，然后进行酝酿整党。他特别说到整党工作不要停止，但也不可操之过急，要有强的干部去领导。各县可在最近几个月内切实作好一个或几个支部的整党工作，取得经验，然后波浪式的展开。要求各地党委根据当地具体情况作出切实的计划。他并提出整党中不是仅仅开除几个坏党员，而且要在土地改革和对敌斗争等群众斗争中，吸收优秀的农民分子入党，使党内增加新血液。现在边区党员数量与人口比例，仍是很小，一般乡村照现有党员数量发展一倍也是可能和必要的。最后仲勋同志还谈及农村团结问题，有些人说：“土改与纠偏把农村闹得不团结了，问题越多了，”这种看法不妥当。农村内本来就有许多问题，不过在土改中间暴露出来罢了。现在暴露了很好，让我们看得清，好来入手解决。但这些问题的彻底解决，一定要在整党和开展农村民主工作中去取得。
