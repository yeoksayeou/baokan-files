Xinhua News Agency, East China, 6th: Under the Chiang Kai-shek occupied area of northern Jiangsu, Nantong city is suffering from heavy taxes and levies imposed by the Chiang bandits, resulting in a depressed market. The Chiang bandits in the city levied a "Second Phase City Defense Fee" of 5 billion yuan. The "Engineering Materials Fee" required each "bao" (unit of 100 households) to pay 19 to 25 shi (approximately 133 kg) of rice depending on its level. The "Baojia Instructor Office Fee" was over 1 million yuan per "bao" per month. The "Soldier Settlement Fee" demanded 10 bundles of foreign yarn per soldier from each "bao". In addition, there were many other strange and unusual apportionments and taxes. Currently, factories and shops are unable to maintain operations and are closing down one after another. Of the eleven rice shops in the city, only three are open. Thirty-four out of thirty-seven money houses have gone bankrupt. Due to losses, almost all native cloth factories have closed down. Commodity prices in the city have risen to over 300,000 times last month's level.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Tianjin News: According to a report on the 19th of last month, in Beiping, the number of businesses that have recently closed down accounts for 7% of the total; those that have suspended operations account for 14%; and those that have requested to close down but have been forcibly ordered by the Chiang bandit authorities to continue operating account for 6%. In total, 27% of the businesses are unable to sustain operations. Taking the pawnshop industry as an example, the situation is extremely bleak. According to the person in charge of the industry association, poor people in Beiping are crowding in to pawn old clothes, but there are very few buyers. Therefore, among the more than 70 member pawnshops, nine-tenths have suspended operations.

　　北平南通两地
  　工商倒闭日多
    【新华社华东六日电】苏北蒋占区南通城蒋匪苛杂繁重，市面凋敝。该城蒋匪“二期城防费”勒索额达五十亿元，“工程材料费”每保按等级缴大米十九石至二十五石，“保甲指导员办公费”每保每月一百余万元，壮丁安家费每保每名洋纱十捆，此外尚有许多无奇不有的摊派捐税。现工厂商店均已无法维持，纷纷关门歇业，全城十一家米店中现只有三家开门，三十七家钱庄中有三十四家倒闭，土布工厂因亏本几全部关门，该城物价上月间已涨至三十多万倍。
    【新华社陕北五日电】天津消息：据上月十九日报载：平市各业商号最近时期歇业的占总数百分之七；停业的占百分之十四；请求歇业而遭蒋匪当局强迫命令继续开业的占百分之六，合计已有百分之二十七的商号无法维待营业。以当铺业论，景况极为萧条，据该业公会负责人谈称：平市贫民典当旧衣物甚为拥挤，买者则寥寥无几，故七十余家会员当铺中，已有十分之九停业。
