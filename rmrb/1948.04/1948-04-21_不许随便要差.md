　　No Randomly Demanding Labor
    Our border region government and military headquarters have jointly issued an order that during the spring plowing season, no one is allowed to randomly demand livestock or manpower for labor. This is to allow us, the common people, to properly handle the spring plowing, sowing, and wheat hoeing, and to produce more grain, ensuring that both the army and the people have enough to eat. From now on, any passersby in the village, whether they are cadres, soldiers, or from any organization, if they demand labor in the village, we must check if they have formal documentation. If they don't, we should ignore them completely. If they try to force or threaten us, we should send them to the government for processing.

　　不许随便要差
    咱们边区政府和军区司令部伙下了一道命令，在春耕期间，不许随便要牲口要人支差，让咱们老百姓把春耕下种、锄麦闹好，多打粮食，保证军队老百姓都有饭吃。以后村里来往行人，不论他是干部，是军人，也不管是啥机关，如在村里要差，就要看看他有没有正式手续，如果没有，就一律不管，他要强迫威胁咱们，就把他送到政府处理。
