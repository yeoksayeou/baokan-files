Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th: Since the railway workers in Meihekou launched a campaign to earn merit in October last year, they have demonstrated a high degree of creativity and initiative. When the locomotive section was first liberated, the entire section had only a few locomotives that could barely be used. Now, dozens of locomotives have been repaired. These locomotives were discarded by Japanese technicians during the puppet Manchukuo era because they were deemed irreparable. All the machines destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been restored, and a power crane for lifting locomotives and planing and drilling machines that had been abandoned for many years have been repaired. A foundry has also been established, new machines have been added, and worker Guo Baoxiang imitated an iron furnace to create a copper furnace. Many locomotive parts are now cast in this copper furnace. Since December last year, workers in the inspection section have automatically repaired 45 damaged carriages, imitated a power saw, and devised a method to use coal soot and soybean oil to prepare substitutes for car-painting oil. Workers also made every effort to save and donate materials and raw materials. For example, it used to take one jin of gasoline to wipe important parts of a locomotive once, but now half a jin of oil can be used four times. Worker Li Fuchun donated five large bronze Buddha statues and a large incense burner from his home to cast bronze tiles, and many workers donated electrical wires from their homes. Workers often voluntarily increase their working hours. Although the locomotive section stipulates that workers get off work at 8 pm, they often work until midnight. Drivers work continuously for more than ten days when transportation is frequent. During the Lunar New Year, it was stipulated that there would be a three-day holiday, but most of the workers in each section did not rest, and during these three days, they repaired four carriages and laid a section of railway tracks. The work efficiency of the workers in each section has generally doubled compared to last year. In the past, it took ten people and fifteen minutes for coal platform workers to load coal and water for a locomotive, but now it only takes four people twelve minutes. Once, eight car repair workers planned to repair more than a dozen damaged carriages in 40 days, but they completed the plan in 18 days. Due to the active work of the workers, a large number of meritorious workers have emerged, and 101 workers have now gloriously achieved merit.

　　梅河口铁路工人积极生产
  　工作效率普遍提高大批工人光荣立功
    【新华社东北十一日电】梅河口铁路工人自去年十月开展立功运动后，发扬了高度的创造性和积极性。机务段在刚解放时，全段仅有几个勉强能用的机车，现在已修好数十个机车，该项机车是伪满时代日本技师认为无法修理而扔掉的。全部恢复了被蒋匪破坏的机器，并修好一架起火车头的电力起重机，以及撇弃多年的刨床钻眼床等。还建立了一个翻砂厂，添置了新机器，工人郭宝祥仿照铁炉创造了一个铜炉，现许多机车零件都由这个铜炉铸造。检车段工人去年十二月起自动修理好四十五辆破车厢，仿造了一架电锯，并设法用煤烟灰和豆油等配制成刷车油的代用品。工人并尽力设法节省和捐献物资原料。如过去擦一次机车上的重要零件需汽油一斤，现在半斤油可擦四次。工人李福春为了铸造铜瓦，献出自己家里的五个大铜佛像和一个大香炉，很多工人捐出家里的电线。工人还常自动增加工作时间，机务段各组工人虽然规定晚上八时下班，但他们经常工作至深夜十二时。司机在运输频繁时连续工作十几天，旧历年关规定放假三天，各段工人大部分都不曾休息，并在这三天期间修好车厢四辆，铺铁轨一段。各段工人工作效率较去年普遍提高一倍，过去煤台工人给机车上煤上水，一次需十个人和十五分钟的时间，现在只需四个人十二分钟。某次八个修车工人计划在四十天内修好十几辆破车厢，但他们十八天就完成了计划。由于工人们的积极工作，涌现大批功臣，现已有一百零一名工人光荣立功。
