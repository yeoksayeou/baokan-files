　　Wheat Storage Work Group Inspects Work
  　Acute Impatience Prevents Mobilization of Poor and Hired Peasants
    [Li Cheng News] The Wheat Storage base point work group inspected their work from the previous period on the 21st of last month, revealing the following problems: 1. Some comrades in the work group displayed acute impatience in mobilizing poor and hired peasants. Comrade Ma Chonglai confessed: "I approached a poor hired peasant and interviewed him. What he told me didn't align with what I wanted to know, and it didn't suit my tastes, so I told him, 'You're busy, I'll sit another time.' I went out to find another poor hired peasant, but the one I found was even less talkative than the first. I looked and looked, and the whole morning passed without mobilizing a single person or understanding the situation. 'Haste makes waste,' that's the mistake I made." After his confession, many comrades said they also had this kind of thinking. This thinking prevents us from deeply mobilizing the poor and hired peasants. It's impossible to understand all the situations after only four or five days; this is subjective fantasy. We must patiently enlighten their class consciousness, cultivate their activity abilities, and connect more poor and hired peasants. This is the correct thought and practice. 2. Although more attention has been paid to mobilizing women than before, the situation has not yet turned around. Male comrades feel it is inconvenient to mobilize women, so they give the task of mobilizing women to two female comrades, and the male comrades don't care. This makes the ideological mobilization and awareness of women lag behind men. 3. The work group does not pay enough attention to cultivating backbone elements. In a movement, without backbone elements, the workers will do everything for them. Because the truly honest poor hired peasants are not mobilized enough, they do not yet have the confidence to take charge, and they are misled by some eloquent people. If the work group does not pay attention to mobilizing the honest and inarticulate poor hired peasants, they will be led astray by these few eloquent people. 4. Regarding the leadership of the base point work group, although there are regular group meetings and a system of studying newspapers every morning to check thoughts and research work, the work of gathering and exchanging experiences to solve specific problems is not done well enough. Because farming will be busy soon, if there is no good research and preparation before each meeting, time will definitely be wasted. When spring plowing gets busy, we need to produce during the day and hold meetings at night, start meetings early, and end meetings early to reduce the fatigue of the masses.

　　麦仓工作组检查工作
  　急性病发动不了贫雇
    【黎城消息】麦仓基点工作组于上月二十一日，检查这一段工作，有以下毛病：一、工作组有部分同志，在发动贫雇中犯了急性病，不耐心。马崇来同志检讨说：“我找上一个贫雇，访问一顿，他给咱说的和我要了解的不对头，听着不合自己的口味，就告他说：‘你忙吧，有时间再坐’。出来再找一个贫雇，结果找的这个，更不多说话，还不如那个。这样找来找去，一上午过去了，结果没发动一个，情况也了解不了。‘心急吃不了热豆腐’，咱就是犯了这个毛病。”他检讨后，不少同志都说存在着这种思想，这种思想使我们不能深入发动贫雇，才来四、五天，就想一下把所有的情况了解是不可能的，这是主观的空想。必须耐心的启发他们的阶级觉悟，培养他们的活动能力，串连更多的贫雇，这才是正确的思想、做法。二、对妇女的发动上，虽比以前注意了，但还未转变过来，男同志觉得发动妇女不方便，将发动妇女给两个女同志，男同志不管。这样使妇女思想发动与觉悟程度赶不上男人。三、工作组对培养骨干重视不够，在一个运动中，没有骨干就会使工作员包办代替，因对真正老实贫雇发动不够，他们还没当家信心，被一些能说会道的人迷惑了。工作组不注意发动老实的不会说话的贫雇起来，就会被这少数能说会道的人当了道。四、在基点工作组的领导上，虽然也有定期的小组会，每天早晨学习报纸等制度，检查思想和研究工作。但汇集交流经验解决具体问题，作的很不够。因今后农忙，如在每次会前没有很好研究与准备，一定会浪费时间。春耕忙起来了，要白天生产，黑夜开会，早开会，早散会，使群众减少疲劳。（麦仓工作组）
