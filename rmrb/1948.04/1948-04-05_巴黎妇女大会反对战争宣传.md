　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st - According to reports from Paris: A grand meeting was held by women in Paris on the 25th to oppose war propaganda and demand the establishment of a lasting peace. The meeting was initiated by the French Women's Union. The chairwoman, Gordon, passionately called on all women in France to unite, do their utmost to guarantee a consolidated and lasting peace, and rise up against the warmongers. Leclère, who represented the International Democratic Women's Federation at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, delivered a speech at the meeting, denouncing the persecution of democratic figures going to the United States, such as Joliot-Curie and herself, by American imperialism. She said: The Marshall Plan is a war policy. The American imperialists hope to use France to achieve their own goals and turn France into a pile of ruins for the benefit of American trusts. But the French people will prevent the realization of this plan. Leclère called on those attending the meeting to join the French Women's Union and jointly defend the peace and security of France.
