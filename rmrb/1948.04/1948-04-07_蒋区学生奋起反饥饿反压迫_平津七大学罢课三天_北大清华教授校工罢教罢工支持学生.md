Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to foreign news agency reports: Seven universities in Beiping and Tianjin, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Sino-French University, Teachers College, Peiyang University, and Nankai University, jointly launched a three-day strike against oppression starting on the 3rd of this month. This was to protest Chiang Kai-shek's order to disband the North China Student Federation, the arrest and torture of Lu Yidong (transliteration), a freshman at Peking University (Lu was arrested by five Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in front of Huiwen Middle School on March 31st, detained for four hours, and subjected to torture), and the fascist atrocities of surrounding Peking University on March 29th, threatening student gatherings, and preventing student parades. It is noted that the student unions of the aforementioned seven universities in Beiping and Tianjin jointly sent a letter to the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang's Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua on the 20th of last month, demanding that all universities in the Chiang-controlled area implement a comprehensive public funding system, increase education funding, and reform the curriculum, among other demands against hunger and enslavement.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Beiping News: Professors and staff of Peking University and Tsinghua University have taken united action to support the just strike against oppression and hunger by students of the seven universities in Beiping and Tianjin. Concurrently with the student strike at the seven universities, professors and staff of the two universities launched a strike from the 3rd onwards. The former demanded that Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Education continue to allocate two bags of flour per month, while the latter demanded a salary increase. A student spokesperson stated that, in addition to protesting Chiang Kai-shek's order to disband the North China Student Federation and the torture and arrest of students, another reason for the joint strike by the seven universities was to protest the Chiang government's rejection of the reasonable demands put forward by the students of the seven universities on the 20th of last month, which included the implementation of a comprehensive public funding system for all universities in the Chiang-controlled area, an increase in education funding to 15% of the total budget, and improvements in the living conditions of faculty and staff. According to an Associated Press report on the 4th, an estimated 5,000 students from just five schools in Beiping—Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Sino-French University, and Teachers College—are participating in the strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Beiping News: The student movement against hunger and striving for comprehensive public funding has gained the support of students' parents. The student unions of six universities—Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Teachers College, Sino-French University, and Chaoyang University—received a telegram from the Shanghai Student Parents' Association on the 5th of last month. The telegram stated in essence: "We are pleased to hear of the call to rescue education and respectfully express our admiration on behalf of millions of student parents in Shanghai. We hope to mobilize and organize a parents' association in Beiping to jointly devise a course of action." It was signed "Shanghai Student Parents' Association," official ＠ Shuang Qiu.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Beiping News: While launching the movement to strive for comprehensive public funding, students in Beiping and Tianjin are also carrying out production mutual aid for self-rescue. At the beginning of last month, the Welfare Group of the Yenching University Student Union planned to launch a spring plowing movement, mobilizing students to reclaim wasteland on campus to plant vegetables or grains. Farming tools and other equipment have been borrowed from the Yenching University Farm. The Student Union of the Beiping Teachers College decided to establish an "Emergency Medical Aid Society" to help poor students suffering from acute illnesses. The Society's regulations stipulate that all students are members, and each person pays a monthly public aid fee of 5,000 Chiang coins. If a student falls ill and a doctor certifies that they need to be hospitalized, the Society will cover three-quarters of their medical and surgical expenses. If, after investigation, it is determined that the patient is truly unable to afford the remaining one-quarter, the Society will pay the entire amount. More than 100 students from Nankai University in Tianjin formed the "Self-Help Work Association for Impoverished Students," collectively seeking jobs such as arranging books, proofreading, tutoring, and weeding to subsidize living expenses. Furthermore, as a result of the solidarity and efforts of self-funded and partially publicly funded students at the school, the school's Chiang Kai-shek authorities have been forced to agree to loan 100 million Chiang coins and have initially distributed a portion of it to various student meal groups to maintain food supplies.

　　蒋区学生奋起反饥饿反压迫
  　平津七大学罢课三天
    北大清华教授校工罢教罢工支持学生
    【新华社陕北五日电】据外国通讯社报导：平、津北大、清华、燕大、中法、师院、北洋、南开七大学于本月三日起联合举行反压迫罢课三天，抗议蒋匪日前下令解散华北学联、逮捕与毒刑拷打北大一年级学生卢宜东（译音，卢系上月三十一日在汇文中学门前被五个蒋匪特务逮捕，拘禁四小时并加毒刑拷打）及于三月二十九日包围北大威胁学生集会阻止学生游行等项法西斯暴行。按：上述平、津七大学学生自治会曾于上月二十日联署致函匪首蒋介石及蒋匪教育部长朱家骅，提出全蒋管区各大学实施全面公费制，增高教育经费及改革课程等项反饥饿反奴化要求。
    【新华社陕北五日电】北平讯：北京、清华两大学教授、校工一致采取行动，支持平津七大学学生反压迫反饥饿正义罢课。与七大学学生罢课同时，两大学教授、校工于三日起举行罢教、罢工。前者要求蒋匪教育部每月继续配售两袋面粉，后者则提出增资要求。学生发言人表示：此次七大学联合罢课除为抗议蒋匪下令解散华北学联及拷打逮捕学生外，另一原因系抗议蒋政府拒绝七大学学生于上月二十日所提全蒋管区大学实行全面公费制、提高教育经费占总预算百分之十五及改善教职员生活等合理要求。据美联社四日电估计：仅北平北京、清华、燕京、中法、师院五校罢课学生即达五千人。
    【新华社陕北五日电】北平讯：蒋管区学生反饥饿争取全面公费运动获得学生家长支持。北大、清华、燕京、师院、中法、朝阳六大学学生自治会于上月五日接获上海学生家长联合会来电，原电大意称：欣闻呼吁抢救教育，谨代表沪市百万学生家长表示敬意。并盼发动组织平市家长会，共策进行。下署“上海各校学生家长联合会”干事＠爽秋。
    【新华社陕北五日电】北平讯：平、津学生与发动争取全面公费运动同时，并进行生产互助自救。上月初燕大学生自治会福利组计划发动春耕运动，发动同学开垦校内荒地，种植蔬菜或谷物。农具等已向燕大农场洽借。北平师院学生自治会为帮助患急病的贫苦同学，决定成立“急病公助会”。该会章程规定同学均为会员，每人月缴公助金蒋币五千元。同学患病经医生证明需住医院者，其医药手术费用由该会负担四分之三，如经调查患病者确无力负担其余的四分之一时，该会将全部代付。天津南开大学学生百余人组成“清寒同学自助工作会”，集体找寻整理图书、校对、家庭教师、除草等工作，以补助生活费用。又该校自费、半公费学生团结力争结果，校方蒋党当局已被迫答应贷款蒋币一亿元，并先发下一部分给各学生膳团维持伙食。
