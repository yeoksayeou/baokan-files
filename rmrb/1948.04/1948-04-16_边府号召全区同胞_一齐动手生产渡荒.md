　　【This newspaper's report】 The Border Region Government issued a call on the 10th of this month to all compatriots in the region to mobilize for production to overcome the famine. The original text of the call is as follows:

　　Last year, our Border Region suffered from severe drought in the spring and summer, resulting in poor harvests in most areas during both the summer and autumn seasons. Furthermore, many areas were hit by floods, hailstorms, or frost in the autumn, causing the average harvest in one-third of the region to be only 40%, and in some cases as low as 20%. This has led to a serious spring famine in the Taihang First, Second, Fourth, and Fifth Sub-regions, the Jinnan Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sub-regions, the Jiluyu Third, Fourth, and Eighth Sub-regions, and the Taiyue Fourth Sub-region. No less than four million people are affected, and over 470,000 people are in need of urgent relief, with the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households without productive capacity accounting for more than one-tenth. The border areas, which are facing the enemy, have suffered repeated destruction, conscription, and grain seizures by the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandits, leading to increased deaths and a large number of refugees fleeing to the interior. In the Taiyue region alone, over 60,000 people have fled to Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Lingshi, and 5,000 have fled to Yuci. In the Jiluyu region of Henan, there are often 40,000 to 50,000 refugees fleeing to Hebei. In total, approximately one-seventh of the region's population, suffering from natural disasters and enemy attacks, needs relief to ensure spring plowing! This is a matter of utmost seriousness! Therefore, we call upon all sectors of our workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants to work together to overcome this immediate disaster!

　　Compatriots! We have the experience of overcoming famine in 1942 and 1943: Relying on our own efforts, mutual assistance, government support, and joint efforts of the military and civilians, using work as a form of relief and engaging in production for self-salvation, we will surely be able to conquer the spring famine. After the Lunar New Year, our government allocated 10 million catties of relief grain to the affected compatriots, followed by 770,000,000 yuan (including 1,600,000,000 yuan of old loans re-lent) for spring plowing production and disaster relief loans, and distributed a portion of relief materials. Various regions have also allocated large amounts of grain and funds for relief. Currently, disaster-stricken areas are launching movements to overcome the famine; some are repairing roads, digging rivers, reclaiming wasteland, and planting forests, using work as a form of relief; some are engaged in various self-salvation activities such as spinning, weaving, transportation, firewood cutting, saltpeter refining, and medicinal herb digging. Some are combining the equitable distribution of land with the use of surplus grain and floating assets to support spring plowing production. Some are using public granaries to save the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed. These good practices and experiences should be actively promoted! In addition, it is especially important to note that all disaster-stricken and non-disaster-stricken areas should immediately begin to rectify mutual aid groups and cooperatives, support production, and ensure spring plowing and planting. To shorten the disaster period, we can plant more spring vegetables and early-maturing crops, and we must focus on long-term disaster prevention, paying attention to building water conservancy projects to prevent floods. Villages that are undergoing land reform and completing democratic movements must closely combine spring plowing production and not leave an acre of land uncultivated; villages that have not yet started should understand the spirit and methods of our government's proclamation of "whoever plants, reaps," and should not hesitate or delay, but fully engage in production. Border areas should implement emergency planting under the protection of the army and militia. Our current tasks and slogans are: "Complete spring plowing and planting, do not leave an acre of land uncultivated!" "Mobilize together, produce to overcome the famine!" The People's Liberation War to overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is victoriously advancing. Launching a production movement throughout the border region and striving to increase grain production is not only necessary to overcome the famine but also an important key to ensuring the victory of the war.

　　Our government has ordered all levels of government to suspend all other assignments during the spring plowing period except for necessary war duties, and the methods for normal assignments are also being revised. Except for military dependents and honorary soldiers who lack labor, all substitutions for farming will be stopped (detailed methods will be issued in separate decrees). The road pass system will be abolished, and efforts will be made to adjust various movement assignments to save everyone's labor time for production. The government will do its best to take various measures to adjust seeds, increase draught animals, exchange materials, stabilize prices, and resolutely protect all industries and commerce (including the urban and rural industries and commerce of landlords and rich peasants) to facilitate the normal development of all industries. We deeply hope that compatriots from all walks of life will firmly believe that the implementation of the Land Law Outline of China will guarantee that every compatriot receives fair and reasonable treatment, and there should be no doubt about it. Landlords and former rich peasants will also receive the same share, and as long as they can work, they can overcome the famine and further embark on the road to prosperity.

　　Comrades of the local work teams, peasant associations, poor peasant leagues, and production committees! All compatriots who are doing their best to overcome the famine! In addition to extending our deep respect and condolences for your hard work in leading land reform and production to overcome the famine, our government hopes that you will seize the time, strengthen organizational leadership, and mobilize and organize every man and woman to participate in production. Let us fight to complete spring plowing, overcome the famine, and strive for victory in the war!

　　边府号召全区同胞
  　一齐动手生产渡荒
    【本报消息】边府于本月十日号召全区同胞一齐动手生产渡荒。号召原文如下：
    去年本边区因春夏苦旱，大部地区是夏秋两季歉收。而不少地区入秋又遭水灾或冰雹风霜，以致在全区三分之一的地方，平均收获不过四成，甚有仅达二成左右者。因此造成当前太行之一、二、四、五分区，冀南之三、四、五分区，冀鲁豫之三、四、八分区，及太岳四分区之严重春荒，灾民不下四百万，需要紧急救济者达四十七万余人，其中老弱孤寡无生产能力之户在十分之一以上。而接敌之边沿区，则由于蒋阎匪徒之反复摧毁，抓丁抢粮，死亡增多，大批逃来内地。仅太岳之平遥、介休、灵石地区，即逃来六万余人，榆次逃来五千人，冀鲁豫河南经常有四五万灾民逃往河北。总计天灾敌祸下之灾胞全区约有七分之一的人口，须待救济以资春耕！这是何等严重的事情！为此，特号召我们的工农兵学商各界，共同努力，克服这一当头灾难！
    同胞们！我们有四二、四三两年的渡荒经验：靠自己动手，大家互助，政府支持，军民协力，以工代赈，生产自救，春荒是必能战胜的。本府对被灾同胞，在旧历年后，即拨救济米一千万斤，继而又发春耕生产及救灾贷款七十七万万元（连收旧转贷者共一百六十万万元），分配了一部分救济物资，各区亦自行拨有大批粮款，进行救济。目前各地灾胞已展开了渡荒的运动；有的修路、挖河、开荒、造林、以工代赈；有的进行纺织、运输、砍柴、熬硝、刨药材等各种自救活动。有的结合平分土地，以所得粮食浮财，支持春耕生产。有的以义仓节约救济老弱孤寡。这些好的事实及经验，应积极的发扬！此外特别提起注意者，所有灾区及非灾区，均应立即动手整顿互助组合作社，扶植生产，保证春耕下种。为了缩短灾期，可多种春菜及早熟作物，并须从长期防灾着眼，注意兴修水利防治水患。正在进行土改填补民主运动的村庄，要密切结合春耕生产，不荒一亩地；还未进行的村庄，更要了解本府“谁种谁收”布告的精神及办法，不要顾虑、迟疑，全力进行生产。边沿区要在军队民兵掩护下，实行抢种。我们的当前任务和口号是：“完成春耕下种，不荒一亩地！”“一齐动手，生产渡荒！”打倒蒋介石匪帮的人民解放战争正在胜利向前，全边区开展生产运动，争取增产粮食，不仅为克服灾荒所必需，亦为保证战争胜利的重要关键。
    本府已令知各级政府春耕期间除必须的战争勤务以外，任何其他支差一律停止，平时支差办法亦正在改订。除缺乏劳力之军属及荣誉军人外，一律停止代耕（详细办法另有法令）。废止路条制度，设法调整各种运动勤务，力求节省每个人的劳力时间用于生产。政府当尽力采取种种办法，调剂种籽，增加耕畜，交流物资，平稳物价，坚决保护一切工商业（包括地主富农的城乡工商业），以利于各业之正常发展。深望各阶层同胞，确信中国土地法大纲之实施，将保证每一个同胞得到公平合理的待遇，不容有任何怀疑。地主旧富农也得同样一份，只要能够劳动，也一样能够渡过灾荒，并进一步走上发家致富的道路。
    各地工作团，农会，贫农团以及生产委员会的同志们！一切为渡荒尽力的同胞们！你们在领导土改与生产渡荒中的辛劳，本府除向你们致深切的敬意与慰问外，更望抓紧时间，加强组织领导，使每一个男女同胞，都动员起来，组织起来，投入生产。为完成春耕战胜灾荒争取战争胜利而斗争！
