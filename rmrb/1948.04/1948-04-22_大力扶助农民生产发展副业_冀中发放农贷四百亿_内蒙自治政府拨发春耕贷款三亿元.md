Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 20th. Jizhong Finance Office issued 4,000,000,000 Jizhong currency (each Jizhong currency is equal to 10 Nationalist currency). Except for 1,000,000,000 retained for flexible use and not yet issued, the remainder has been distributed to various districts. The eighth, ninth, and eleventh districts plan to dig canals and repair roads, sink 3,325 new wells, repair 44,748 old wells, add 2,204 new waterwheels, repair 11,654 waterwheels, and increase livestock by 4,838. Each district also plans to manufacture a large number of farm tools, afforestation, shipbuilding, develop sideline occupations, and regulate seeds. The total planned expenditure for each district is 54,726,350,000 yuan. In addition to vigorously organizing private capital and floating assets to be invested in production, the government has already loaned 29,786,000,000 yuan. Currently, the eighth, ninth, and eleventh districts have formed 103 well-digging teams. Loan interest rates are divided according to purpose: digging new wells, opening canals, and buying waterwheels are interest-free loans; repairing old wells, buying farm tools, livestock, seeds, fertilizers, repairing waterwheels, and afforestation are subject to a monthly interest rate of 0.5% to 1%. Factories and household sideline occupations that make waterwheels and farm tools are subject to a monthly interest rate of 1% to 1.5%, with those engaged in cooperative forms charged 1%. The Finance Office also proposed measures for issuing sideline occupation loans: 1. Focus on issuing loans to disaster-stricken villages, poor villages, small suburban villages, and areas where the masses' livelihoods mainly rely on sideline occupations and where sideline occupations are relatively developed. 2. Loan recipients include textile, transportation, and other small handicraft production organizations. 3. Each district should focus on the use and control based on the specific conditions of each county, and should not distribute them evenly.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th. In order to launch a large-scale production campaign in the agricultural areas of Xing'an and Na-Wen-Mu-Ren League, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee issued instructions last month, calling on Party committees and governments at all levels to fully organize the masses for spring plowing, advocating "send one more cart of manure, harvest one more dou of grain," and organize the exchange of labor and plows. Each banner should have at least one blacksmith's furnace and woodworking shop to manufacture farm tools. In pastoral areas, due to heavy snow last winter and many livestock deaths, attention should be paid to feeding, breeding, and epidemic prevention this spring. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government has allocated 300 million yuan for spring plowing loans, and decided that after democratic discussions by poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants, interest-free loans will be provided to farmers who lack livestock, seeds, farm tools, and food rations, and the loans will be repaid without interest in the autumn. Those with special difficulties may be exempted from repayment. Currently, 80% of the agricultural loans have been distributed to various banners. At the same time, in order to reduce the burden on the people, the Autonomous Government has called on all government agencies and organizations to participate in agricultural production and solve local difficulties. Ulanhot City (i.e., Wangye Temple) government agencies are actively preparing to reclaim wasteland for production, and more than 500 hectares of wasteland northwest of the city have been allocated to various agencies for use. Teachers and students of the Inner Mongolia Military and Political University enthusiastically responded to the call for large-scale production, and have already begun delivering manure. They plan to grow one mu of vegetables per person, delivering 500 jin of spring vegetables and 2,000 jin of autumn vegetables, ensuring self-sufficiency in vegetables throughout the year.
