    　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Moscow Dispatch: The Deputy Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union, the famous writer Simonov, recently published an article in Pravda, discussing the great achievements of post-war Soviet literature based on the winning works of the 1947 Stalin Literary Prizes. He pointed out that 1947 was an outstanding year in the history of Soviet literature, demonstrating significant meaning in two aspects: First, young writers have written outstanding works comparable to those of famous veteran writers. Second, the Great Patriotic War of Self-Defense and the post-war construction advancing towards communism have become the sole themes of Soviet writers. The arduous struggle and magnificent picture of enthusiastic construction of the Soviet people have been expressed by writers in their artistic creations. Due to the emergence of a large number of new talents, the creative scope of the Soviet literary world has become far broader than in the past. This shows that Soviet literature has passed the cruel test of war, gained new life and blood, and reached a level surpassing the past. Soviet literature has become an increasingly important part of the people's lives in building and transforming our motherland.
