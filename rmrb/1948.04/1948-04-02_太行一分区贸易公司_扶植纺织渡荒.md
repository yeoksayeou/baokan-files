According to the administrative office's instructions on production and disaster relief, the company has formulated a hundred-day work plan to continuously supply raw materials and promote the purchase of finished products from disaster-stricken people. The fourteen stores established in various counties of the First District have 2 million jin of cotton and 30 million jin of grain in stock, specifically for disaster-stricken people to exchange for woven homespun cloth. The Xingtai City branch store receives an average of 100,000 square chi of cloth from disaster-stricken people every day and sells more than 10,000 jin of cotton. Neiqiu City collects 150,000 square chi of cloth per market day.
