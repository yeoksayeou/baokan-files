Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 31st. Spring wheat has been largely planted in various parts of eastern Hebei. Now, efforts are being made to rush plant sorghum and japonica rice. Before planting wheat, the Baodi County Bank selectively provided 380 million yuan in loans to 128 poor villages, solving some of the problems with seeds, farm tools, and fertilizers. After obtaining wheat seeds, seven villages in the first district, including Wang’anzi, formed voluntary mutual aid teams of three to five households to plant wheat. They completed planting 850 mu of spring wheat in five days. Under the call of the Farmers' Association, the entire village of Dongwangzhuang in the tenth district, men and women alike, pitched in and planted all 570 mu of wheat fields in the village by the end of the first lunar month. Under the slogan of "Plant more spring wheat, eat more white flour," farmers in Yutian County launched a rush planting campaign. Farmers in Dahu Village dug ditches at night with lanterns and encouraged each other, saying, "Now that the land has returned home, a little hard work is nothing." Farmers in Zhaizhuangzi exchanged gold and silver jewelry from the fruits of victory for large quantities of fertilizer and bean cakes to develop production. They also paid attention to organizing landlords to produce, ensuring that not a single mu of land in the village was left uncultivated, and 200 mu of spring wheat had been rushed to completion. Xinji Town in Sanhe County has planted 40 hectares of wheat fields. Women also enthusiastically participated in production. Wang Dajie, the director of the Women's Association, not only planted 12 mu of wheat with her husband but also spun half a kilogram of cotton in three nights. While actively producing, the masses also helped and educated loafers, enabling them to plant spring wheat on the newly distributed land. After wheat planting in various counties, there was abundant rainfall. New wheat in Zunhua, Pinggu, and other places has already sprouted green shoots.

　　冀东各地种完春麦
    【新华社东北三十一日电】冀东各地春麦已大部种完，现正积极赶种高粱和粳子。宝坻县银行在种麦前将三亿八千万元贷款有重点的放给一百二十八个穷村，解决了一部分种子、农具和肥料问题。一区王庵子等七个村于获得麦种后，即三户五户自由搭帮互助种麦，五天种完春麦八百五十亩。十区东王庄在农会号召下，全村男女一齐动手，于旧历正月下旬将全村五百七十亩麦田全部种上。玉田县农民在“多种春麦，多吃白面”的口号下，掀起抢种热潮。大胡庄农民于晚上打着灯笼挖沟，并互相鼓励说：“土地回了家，累点不算啥。”砦庄子农民将胜利果实中的金银首饰换回大宗肥料和豆饼发展生产。并注意组织地主生产，保证该村不荒一亩地，二百亩春麦已抢种完毕。三河县新集镇已种四十顷麦地。妇女亦热烈参加生产，妇女会主任王大嫂除和丈夫一起种上十二亩麦子外，并在三个晚上纺花一斤。群众在积极生产中还帮助和教育二流子，使他们把新分得的地种上春麦。各县种麦后，甘霖普降。遵化、平谷等地新麦已吐出绿芽。
