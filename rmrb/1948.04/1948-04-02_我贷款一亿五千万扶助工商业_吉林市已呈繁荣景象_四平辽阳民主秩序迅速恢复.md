Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 31st. The Jilin Democratic Municipal Government is now vigorously supporting industry and commerce and restoring the city's appearance. In recent days, in addition to holding symposiums for industrialists and businessmen to discuss resumption of business, it has allocated 150 million Northeast Bank circulating notes (equivalent to 750,000 million in Guannei Chiang Kai-shek currency) for industrial and commercial loans, and transferred 20 million Northeast Administrative Committee emergency relief funds (equivalent to 100,000 million in Guannei Chiang Kai-shek currency). 70 million of this was used for work relief, repairing streets, tidying up the city, and building housing for the poor. At present, shops on Sanjing Street, Wuwei Road, and Henan Street have opened one after another. Huayuhao, a famous grain store in the city, which suffered huge losses due to two robberies by Chiang Kai-shek bandits and whose owner, Hua Zhongsan, was also injured, has also resumed business. The city market is showing a new prosperous scene. The city's Trade Bureau is shipping in 30 trucks of grain every day to overcome the city's food difficulties. The two rush repair engineering teams organized by the Railway Bureau, for civil engineering and electrical work, are also making very smooth progress in their repairs. At present, the La (fa) Ji (lin) line has been opened to Jiangmifeng, and the entire line will be open to traffic in early next month. The railways from Kouqian to Shuanghezhen, and from Jilin to Jiutai are also being vigorously repaired. Postal and long-distance telephone services have been restored. As for intellectuals, in addition to the municipal government jointly convening a city-wide representative conference of teachers and students with the provincial government on the 14th of this month to announce the new democratic education policy, it has also decided to enable as many intellectuals in the city as possible to participate in various jobs. In the past few days, the municipal government has also held citizen meetings in various districts to explain the current policies of the democratic government.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th. After the recovery of Siping, the democratic government is actively engaged in relief and restoration work. The municipal government has distributed 20 million yuan in relief funds (equivalent to 100,000 million in Chiang Kai-shek's legal currency), and the general disaster victims have been spared from starvation. The Garrison Headquarters has taken in more than 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek stragglers, given them travel expenses, and sent them back to their hometowns. Landlords from various places who fled to the city have registered with the democratic government and are going through procedures to return to their villages. The municipal government recently held a symposium of industry and commerce representatives to explain the democratic government's policies on protecting industry and commerce and the city. The Northeast Bank and the Trade Bureau have decided to help private enterprises with funds and raw materials so that they can quickly resume business. The railway connecting the city to eastern and western Manchuria is being actively repaired, the electrical industry will be able to resume work soon, and all unemployed workers in the city have now been introduced to jobs by the democratic government.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th. After the recovery of Liaoyang, all of the city's more than 1,000 shops have resumed business, and business is far more prosperous than during the Chiang Kai-shek occupation. For example, the Wanhufu Department Store on Beida Street traded a maximum of 200,000 to 300,000 Chiang Kai-shek circulating notes per day when Chiang Kai-shek occupied it last December, but now it can sell 400,000 to 500,000 Northeast Bank currency per day (equivalent to more than 2 million Chiang Kai-shek circulating notes). More than 7,000 workers in the city have organized a general trade union and 18 industrial branches. In order to solve the difficulties of unemployed workers, the democratic government has distributed 40,000 catties of relief grain, and is trying to introduce them to jobs. The cultural circles warmly support the Northeast Bureau's "Decision on Intellectuals" and are now preparing to organize a youth federation. In order to meet cultural needs, three libraries have been established, each equipped with more than 300 kinds of books and magazines published in the liberated areas, as well as major newspapers in the Northeast liberated areas, for free reading. The libraries are extremely crowded from morning to night.

　　我贷款一亿五千万扶助工商业
  　吉林市已呈繁荣景象
    四平辽阳民主秩序迅速恢复
    【新华社东北卅一日电】吉林民主市政府现正大力扶助工商业，恢复市容。连日来除召开各工商业家座谈会，商谈复业工作外，并拨发工商贷款东北银行流通券一万万五千万元（折合关内蒋匪币七十五万万元），及转拨东北行政委员会紧急救济款两万万元（折合关内蒋匪币一百万万元），并以其中七千万元以工代赈，修建街道，整顿市容，修建贫民住宅。目前市内三经街、五纬路、河南街各商铺纷纷开业，该市著名粮店华裕号曾遭蒋匪两次抢劫，损失极巨，店主华仲三亦被打伤，现亦已复业。全市市面已呈现新的繁荣景象。该市贸易局为克服市内粮食困难，每日有三十辆汽车运入粮食。铁路局组织之工务和电务两个赶修工程队，抢修工作亦极顺利进行中。目前拉（法）吉（林）线已通至江密峰，下月初即可全线畅通。由口前至双河镇，及吉林至九台的铁路亦在大力抢修中。邮政和长途电话已恢复畅通。对知识分子除市府于本月十四日联合省政府召开全市教职学员代表会，宣布新民主主义的教育方针外，并已决定尽量使市内知识分子得以参加各种工作。过去数天内市府并曾分区召开市民大会，解释民主政府当前各种政策。
    【新华社东北卅日电】四平收复后，民主政府积极从事救济与恢复工作，市府已发放救济款两千万元（合蒋匪法币十万万元），一般灾民均已免于饥饿。警备司令部已收容蒋匪散兵游勇二千余名发给路费，遣送回籍。逃亡该市之各地地主，则均向民主政府登记，办理还乡手续。日前市府曾召开工商代表座谈会，说明民主政府保护工商业及城市政策。东北银行与贸易局并决定以资金原料帮助各私人企业，使其迅速复业。该市联接东西满各地之铁路已在积极修复中，电气工业最近即可复工，全市失业工人，现在已由民主政府介绍全部获得工作。
    【新华社东北三十日电】辽阳收复后，全市千余家商店已全部恢复营业，生意远较蒋匪侵占期间繁荣，如北大街万户福百货店去年腊月蒋占时每日最多交易蒋匪流通券二三十万元，现在每天能卖东北银行本币四、五十万元（合蒋匪流通券二百多万元）。市内七千余工人已组织了总工会与十八个产业分会。民主政府为解决失业工人困难，已发放救济粮四万斤，并正设法分别予以介绍工作。文化界热烈拥护东北局“关于知识分子的决定”，现正筹备组织青联。为满足文化要求，并已成立三个图书室，各备有解放区出版的书籍杂志三百余种，及东北解放区各大报纸，供给自由阅览，现各图书室由晨至晚，异常拥挤。
