    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Lille dispatch: On the 21st, 130,000 workers in the state-owned coal mines of Calais and Nord departments in northern France launched a 24-hour general strike. The strike was triggered by a recent explosion in the Chalon coal mine near Lille (belonging to the Nord department), in which more than ten workers died. This aroused the anger of the workers, who protested against the poor safety equipment and demanded compensation for the families of the deceased miners. After the accident, French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez personally went to the mining area to express his condolences.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: TASS, Paris dispatch: Thousands of young people and working people in Paris held demonstrations on the 18th, and then attended a mass meeting convened by the Seine Provincial Committee of the French Communist Party at Buffalo Stadium. French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez delivered a lengthy speech, listing the tragic lives of outstanding young people in France under the Schuman government. He said that due to the housing shortage, 200,000 agricultural workers can only live in stables and warehouses. Bread and milk rations have been reduced, and meat is nowhere to be seen in the market. The lack of food supply has resulted in one million underdeveloped children in France, and lung diseases are rampant. 90,000 young workers are unemployed in Paris. Although young workers do the same work as adult workers, they receive 20% less wages than adults. 100,000 young men and women cannot enter vocational schools. At the same time, military spending continues to increase. While preventing young people from receiving vocational training, the French rulers also use movies, radio, newspapers, and pornographic literature to carry out propaganda that corrupts morals, vilifies everything great and sublime, and spreads decadent and pessimistic ideas. After denouncing the purpose of the Marshall Plan as turning France into an American colony, Thorez called on French youth to reject the disastrous policies of the Schuman government. He pointed out that the struggle of French youth to improve their living standards and oppose the Mayer Plan is inseparable from the overall struggle for national independence, peace, and freedom. Thorez then explained the seventeen-point program put forward by the Central Committee of the French Communist Party on the 16th, pointing out that this program can be realized through a democratic and unified movement. The French Communist Party and the working class will play a decisive role in it. This program fully expresses the deepest hopes of the French people. Thorez then vehemently criticized De Gaulle's conspiracy activities in Marseille and called on everyone to unite to safeguard freedom, peace, and national independence.

    巴黎数千人民举行示威游行
    法北煤矿工总罢工
    多列士号召反对舒曼政府
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】里尔讯：二十一日法国北部加莱及诺尔省国有煤矿十三万工人爆发二十四小时总罢工。罢工起因是最近里尔（属诺尔省）附近沙扬煤矿发生爆发事件，十余工人死于非命，引起工人的愤怒，群起抗议恶劣的安全设备，要求抚恤遇难矿工家属。法共总书记多列士于出事后，曾亲往矿区慰问。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：巴黎青年和劳动人民数千人，于十八日举行示威游行后，在布法罗运动场参加法共塞纳省委召开之群众大会。法共总书记多列士发表长篇演说：列举在舒曼政府统治下法国优秀青年的悲惨生活说：由于房荒，二十万农业工人只能住在马厩和仓房里。面包和牛奶配给量减少了，市场上看不见肉类。食物供应之不足，使法国有一百万发育不完全的儿童，肺病到处流行。巴黎有九万青年工人失业。青年工人与成年工人虽作同样工作，但所得工资却较成人少百分之二十。十万男女青年无法进职业学校。同时军费却不断增加。法国统治者一面使青年不能受到职业训练，一面又以电影、广播、报章和色情文学来进行败坏风俗的宣传，污蔑一切伟大和崇高的事物，散布颓废与悲观的思想。多氏在斥责马歇尔计划目的在把法国变为美国殖民地后，号召法国青年拒绝接受舒曼政府的灾难性的政策。他指出法国青年争取提高生活水准，反对迈耶计划的斗争，是和争取民族独立、和平、与自由的总的斗争分不开的。多列士接着说明法共中央委员会于十六日所提出的十七条纲领，指出这一纲领可经由民主统一的运动来实现。法共及工人阶级将在其中起决定作用。这一纲领充分表现了法国人民最深切的希望。多列士继即痛斥戴高乐在马赛的阴谋活动，并号召大家一致团结，以维护自由、和平与民族独立。
