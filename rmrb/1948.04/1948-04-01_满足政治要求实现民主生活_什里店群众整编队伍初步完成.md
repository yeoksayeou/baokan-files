　　Satisfying Political Demands and Realizing Democratic Life
    Shilidian's Masses Complete Preliminary Team Reorganization
    Good Party Member Wang Xitang Universally Supported with the Most Votes
    Poor and Newly Emerging Middle Peasants Unite to Take Charge
    [Our Dispatch] The preliminary completion of mass reorganization in Shilidian, the ninth district of Wu'an, has been achieved. Following the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League, the Peasants' Association and Peasants' Representative Assembly were organized immediately, village committee members were elected, and a village government was formed. All peasants, with the poor peasants as the backbone, united, promoted democracy, and reformed party members, thus initially satisfying the political demands of the masses. When the Poor Peasants' League was established, the poor peasants felt isolated, and some said at the time: "Good middle peasants should also be allowed to join." The initiator said: "After we establish the Poor Peasants' League, we will establish the Peasants' Association, and they can join the Peasants' Association." On the middle peasant side, because the work team paid attention to uniting the middle peasants as soon as they arrived in the village, the middle peasants' emotions have not been very turbulent. A significant manifestation is that most of the manure has been sent to the fields. Middle peasants are also very active in the meetings, with only a few showing anxiety. On the second day after the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League, the members went to find targets for development. Some middle peasants automatically talked about their shortcomings during the conversations. The members told them: Tell everyone at the group meeting, as long as you are determined to wash away the "rough air." This time, only good people can join the association, and bad people have to change their faults before they can. The conditions for Peasants' Association membership, stipulated by the Poor Peasants' League and agreed upon by the new members of the Peasants' Association, are: labor, being of one mind with the poor and hired peasants, not following the path of the landlords, not being a major rogue or corrupt person, and not clinging to small cliques. Some groups made public exposures of those who liked to cling to small cliques. By the 16th, most of the middle and poor peasants had joined the Peasants' Association (many women also joined the new Peasants' Association, but the ideological mobilization of women was still very poor, and some people still did not know what the Peasants' Association was for). At this time, only a small number of peasants had not joined the Peasants' Association.
    During the process of uniting the middle peasants, the reorganization of the mass ranks was combined with Party rectification. On the 15th, each group selected representatives (in addition to members of the Poor Peasants' League, some good middle peasants also participated) to review the third batch of Party members (the first and second batches were reviewed and approved during the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League). Regarding the views on Party members, some said: Party members made mistakes because the laws and regulations were different then and now, and they should not be punished too severely, otherwise who would dare to be a cadre? Some said: It was not easy for people to start the work, and if they can correct their mistakes, they can still be Party members. If they cannot correct them, they should be dealt with according to the severity of the mistake. Who has not made a mistake? Major mistakes and minor mistakes should be distinguished. Most people said: Good Party members can still do things for us. If they are made to be hired laborers and not given work to do, how can they serve? Some said: Without Party members, could we have turned ourselves over? Some said: Those who can be pillars should be pillars, and those who can be rafters should be rafters... In the end, the worker summarized everyone's speeches and correctly explained the relationship between the Party and the masses, explaining: "This time, it is different from washing faces and wiping away the blackness. Last time, good and bad people were brought back onto the stage. This time, we must distinguish between good and bad. The branch was undemocratic in the past, and it was wrong to say that only Party members must be elected during the election. If we say the opposite, that Party members should not be elected, that would also be wrong. If Party members are reformed and come to unite with us, and we leave them, wouldn't that be creating division again? We must not be fooled by bad people."
    There are three types of people who have anti-Party sentiments: First, a few of the past activists have always been opposed to the cadres, saying things like: "Now the cadres must be completely swept away and replaced!" Second, individual demobilized soldiers always complain that the cadres do not take good enough care of them; they also want to show off in this movement, so they just shout: "Which of these Party members is qualified to be a Party member? I don't think there is even one!" Third, a few people who have been beaten by public security officers and militia instructors and their close relatives and friends are afraid of being retaliated against if they raise opinions, and at the same time, they have a bellyful of grievances that they want to vent. It is inevitable that they have these emotions, but they are being used by a few bad people, turning it into opposition to everyone, regardless of good or bad. There are also some people who do not understand the Party and regard the Party as a sectarian clique, blindly rejecting Party members. In order to correct these erroneous thoughts, after discussions among the poor peasant committee members and group leaders, each group held separate meetings, distinguishing between good and bad, and breaking the "sweep away everything" mentality. In fact, except for a few people, most people can distinguish between right and wrong; an old woman named Zhang Xianzi said: "When the work team came, I was worried that they would not distinguish between our good village chief (Wang Xitang, a Party member) and those bad Party members, and would not want any of them." An old man, after listening to a Party member's self-criticism, said with emotion: "The leadership of the Communist Party is good. It can really turn people good. I think every one of these Party members is better than me." There were also some who did not know the importance of the new Peasants' Association, and said when deliberating on the candidates for the Peasants' Association committee members: "Wang Xitang, let's elect him when we elect village cadres. Let's save him for later, and don't elect him this time." The masses divided Party members into four types: the best, the second best, those who have not played a major role, and the particularly bad. The results of the group's distinctions between good and bad were similar.
    At the same time, the branch formed a temporary group with Party members who had joined the Poor Peasants' League and the Peasants' Association, taking the initiative to strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses, and paying attention to introducing the Party's self-criticism to the masses. It also humbly put forward various suggestions within the Poor Peasants' League and the Peasants' Association, actively participating in the movement. On the 18th, the founding meeting of the Peasants' Association was held, and fifteen members of the Peasants' Association were elected, including six poor peasant members, one Poor Peasants' League member (new middle peasant), two old middle peasants (one is a Party member), five Party members, and three women (one is a poor peasant member). Among them, Party member Wang Xitang was most supported by the masses and received the most votes. During the election, when his name was called, the whole audience raised their fists. Later, the Peasants' Association committee also elected him as chairman.
    After the establishment of the Peasants' Association, a general meeting was held that same evening to allow the masses to express their opinions on several old cadres (the masses in this village had more opinions on the old cadres than on the current cadres) in order to raise awareness and consolidate unity in common action. At the meeting, the chairman (of the Peasants' Association committee) supported the masses, urging everyone to "speak out about any grievances, and we will definitely take action, but let's not quarrel or fight." Wang Tiedan's son stood up first and said: "When you were the village chief, you wanted my mother to kill my father, but my mother didn't harm him. Later, you forced my mother and my eldest sister to hang themselves. The person who took them down is still alive." Another person said: "During the bad year, my shopkeeper's little niece went to the field to pick her own beans, and you said she was stealing, and you hung up this niece of mine, with her bare back and her hands tied behind her back, on the street. The shopkeeper was so hungry at that time that he couldn't move at home, and couldn't come out. The little niece was beaten so badly that she didn't eat for four or five days, and she died!"... More and more people raised opinions about him. The main ones were forced buying of land at low prices, embezzling relief grain, instigating divorces, profiting from them, and raping women. The most complaints were about when he was the village chief during the famine years, when the poor people were so hungry that they could not bear it, and when they went to the fields to dig vegetables or pick beans, he would hang them up, take their baskets, and fine them. It is said that more than 20 people were hung up. At that time, a large tree on the street was often hung with people like a grape rack. He would take four or five baskets every day, and he ate the fines and the grain himself. Some people could not continue speaking because they were crying. When Li Baoen complained, many people below shed tears. After more than 50 complaints were made, there were still many honest peasants who had not spoken their minds. At this time, it was already very late, and everyone said: "We won't be able to finish talking until dawn. Let's discuss how to deal with him first." After everyone deliberated, they put forward their opinions. After discussion, the Peasants' Association committee decided: He must first answer two questions: Remove the "spy hat" for people; guarantee not to retaliate. As for the embezzlement, he will have to settle accounts. Other cases will be submitted to the People's Court for handling in the future. Before the matter is handled, except for going to his own field to work, he must stay at home and reflect, and he is not allowed to wander around on the street, or threaten or retaliate. A few people were still infected with the bad habits of the past, demanding to "hang a sign" on Wang Kebin's body, demanding to "detain" him immediately, and "hang him up"; most of the masses were not interested in this, saying: "He wrongly hung us in the past, we will not hang people again." When the presidium (Peasants' Association committee members) said to everyone: "We do not have the right to detain people. If he should be detained, the government should detain him," only a few people temporarily "deflated." Afterwards, the masses reflected: "It is still right not to detain him, not to detain him, and see what else he can do to us! We are organized, and 20 Wang Kebins will not work! If we are not united, can we detain him for a lifetime? He will retaliate when he is released." The next afternoon, opinions were raised against Fu Gaolin. A few people had private revenge emotions. This meeting also showed that the mobilization was not enough; when opinions were raised against Wang Kebin, the old "activists" did not speak, and the masses spoke more; when opinions were raised against Fu Gaolin, the masses spoke less again when a few people shouted. After this meeting, the work team seized this example to let the masses discuss: Is the handling fair? Have the masses really taken charge? What are the harms of honest peasants not taking charge? How can we take good charge? ……In this way, the establishment of the Peasants' Representative Assembly became the masses' own demand.
    The whole village was divided into thirty-one Peasants' Representative Assembly groups. Each group first elected three representative candidates. After review by the Poor Peasants' League Committee, four people were not approved. That afternoon (the 22nd), formal representatives were elected (one person from each group, a total of thirty-one people, including nine poor peasants, sixteen new middle peasants, and six old middle peasants). In the evening, the first Peasants' Representative Assembly was held, with the Peasants' Association committee members serving as the presidium and the Peasants' Association chairman serving as the Peasants' Representative Assembly chairman. The conference discussed three major issues: deciding on the organizational system of the new village government; demanding fair distribution of corvée labor; and demanding fair methods of land cultivation on behalf of others. The first two matters were resolved. The last one was decided to be discussed at a military dependents' meeting before a decision is made. On the morning of the 22nd, each group deliberated on the candidates for the village committee members. In the afternoon, a village meeting was held for elections. In order to enable everyone to truly express their own wishes, this major election adopted a personal registration method: First, a dozen copies of the candidate list were written. The workers and several comrades from the stationed organs each took one, and each person was responsible for two groups, calling the voters to the side one by one to let them quietly say who they wanted to elect. The worker marked the list. The candidates sat in a row on the stage. Some people who did not know the "names" of the candidates would ask them to say which number they were on the stage. As a result of this election, nine village committee members were elected from sixteen candidates. It can be seen from this election that: (1) Honest poor peasants are the most supported. The two who received the most votes were members of the Poor Peasants' League. (2) Party members are generally supported. Three Party members were elected among the nine elected. (3) Those who advocated "complete replacement" failed. Five of the nine elected were former cadres. (4) Sectarian opinions between the upper and lower streets were further reduced. Although the number of voters in the village was small, three people were also elected. (5) The middle and poor peasants are very united. Three old middle peasants were also elected.
    The masses were satisfied with the election method, saying: "This is really democratic!" They were also very satisfied with the election results. After the names of the elected people were announced, the whole audience burst into laughter and cheers. They felt that they had really elected the people they had in mind. When the elected people asked the masses for their opinions, the masses shouted: "No opinion, lead us to do it!" Some of the elected committee members said: "I have never done anything before, and I don't know what can be done and what cannot be done." The masses shouted: "Everyone will help you!"
    The elected village committee members initially still felt that "the burden is heavy and pressing"; some said: they could not speak; some said: they were illiterate; some were afraid of being too busy and not being able to farm; some were still other committee members or group leaders, afraid of doing several things at once and not being able to do them all. After the masses cheered them on, and the work team also explained to them, after doing things for a few days, their heavy feeling has been reduced a lot; some people are still unfamiliar with doing things, but they are energetic, serious, and democratic; the cadres are beginning to develop a new style of work, and a new look is beginning to appear in the village; the new cadres are leading the masses to enter the filling movement.

　　满足政治要求实现民主生活
    什里店群众整编队伍初步完成
    好党员人人拥护王喜堂票数最多
    贫雇新老中农联合当家做主
    【本报消息】武安九区什里店群众整编队伍已初步完成。成立贫农团后，紧接着就组织了农会、农代会，选举村政委员，组成了村政府。全体农民以贫农为骨干团结起来，发扬了民主，改造了党员，初步满足了群众政治要求。在贫农团成立时，贫农就感到势孤，有人那时就说：“好的中农也叫人家进来才对。”发起人说：“咱成立了贫农团接着就成立农会，可以叫他们入农会。”在中农方面，因为工作组一到村就注意了团结中农问题，中农情绪一直没有多大动荡，显著的表现是：粪大部送到地里了，在会场中中农也很活跃，只有个别表现不安。贫农团成立第二天，团员们分别去找发展对象；有些中农在谈话时就自动谈出自己的缺点；团员就给他说：到小组会上给大家说说，只要决心洗“糙气”就行。这回是好人才能入会，坏人要改了毛病才能入。贫农团规定并取得农会新会员同意的农会会员的条件是：劳动，和贫雇一条心，不走老财路线，不是大流氓腐化，不抱小圪塔。对有些爱抱小圪塔的，有些组作了公开揭露。到十六日，大部分中贫农即入了农会（参加新农会的妇女也不少，但妇女的思想发动做的还是很差，有些人还不知道农会是干啥的）。这时只剩下很少数农民未入农会。
    在串连中农期间，同时使整编群众队伍和整党相结合。十五日各组选派代表（除贫农团员外，还吸收一部分好的中农参加）审查第三批党员（第一、二批是在贫农团成立过程中审查通过的）。对党员的看法上，他们有的说：党员犯错误是那时法令和眼下不一样，不该处罚太重，不然谁还敢当干部？有的说：人家开辟工作也不容易，有过能改还可以当党员，不能改再分别轻重处理他。那个人没有错？大错小错要分开点。大多数人则说：好党员还是能给咱办事，叫他们当长工，不给他们活做，叫他们怎么当？有的说：没有党员，咱还能翻了身？有的说：能当梁还叫当梁，能当椽就叫当椽………。最后，工作员就总结大家的发言，正确解释了党和群众的关系，说明：“这次和洗脸擦黑决不相同，那次是不分好坏都又上了台，这次一定要分别好坏。支部过去不民主，选举时说非选党员不行，是不对的。我们如果反过来说是党员就都不选，也不对。党员改造好了，来和咱团结，咱又走了，这不又成了闹分裂？咱可不要上坏人的当。”
    有三种人是有反党情绪的：一、过去的积极分子中的少数几个人，一向和干部对立，如说：“现在干部非一扫清大换班不可！”二、个别退伍军人，老嫌干部对他照顾不够；同时也想在这次运动中露露头角，也就随便大叫：“这批党员里哪个够党员资格？我看一个也没有！”三、曾被公安员、民兵指导员吊打过的几个人和他们的近门、感情好的，一方面怕提了意见再受报复，一方面一肚子冤气想出一出。他们有这情绪是难免的，但被少数坏人利用了，弄成不分好坏一概反对。还有些人是对党不了解，把党看成了一个抱小圪塔的宗派，盲目的排斥党员。为了纠正这些错误思想、贫农委员、小组长座谈后，各组就又分别开了会，区别好坏，打破“一扫光”思想。实际除少数人外，大多数人则是能分清是非好坏的；一个老太婆张闲子说：“工作组来了的时候俺就发愁，怕把俺的好村长（王喜堂，党员）和那几个坏党员不分，都不要了。”一个老汉在听了党员的一次反省后，感动的说：“共产党领导的就是好，真能把人变好，我看这些党员哪一个也比我强。”还有的因为不知道新农会的重要，在酝酿农会委员候选人的时候说：“王喜堂，咱到选村干部的时候再选他，先保存起来吧，这次先不要选。”群众把党员分别成最好的，次好的，未起大作用的，特别坏的四种，各组分别好坏的结果，都相差无几。
    同时，支部把已参加贫农团和农会的党员成立了一个临时小组，主动地密切党群关系，注意介绍党内反省情况给群众。并在贫农团、农会内部虚心的提出各种建议，积极参加运动。十八日开了农会成立大会，选出农会委员十五人，其中有贫农委员六人，贫农团员一人（新中农），老中农二人（一个是党员），党员五人，妇女三人（一个是贫农委员）。其中以党员王喜堂最为群众拥护，票数最多。选举中在叫到他的名字时，全场都举起了拳头，以后农会委员会并推举他做主席。
    农会成立后，当天晚上就召开大会，让群众倾诉，对几个旧干部的意见（本村群众对几个旧干部比对现任干部意见多的多）以在共同行动中提高觉悟，巩固团结。在大会上主席（农会委员）给群众撑腰，要大家“有冤枉事都诉出来，提了一定顶事，不过咱可不要吵嘴、打架。”先给王克斌提，王铁旦的儿子首先站起来说：“你当村长的时候，要我娘非把我爹杀了，我娘没有害，后来把我娘和我大姊妹逼的吊死，眼下卸吊人还在世。”又一个人说：“赖年景俺大掌柜的小妮子去地摘自己的豆子，说俺是偷的，吊起俺这侄女子，光脊梁背起手吊到大街上，大掌柜那时饿的在家不能动了，出不来，小妮子叫打得回去四、五天没吃下饭，死啦！”……提他意见的越来越多。主要的如贱价强买土地，私吞救济粮，挑拨离婚，从中使钱，强奸妇女等。提的最多的是他在灾荒年当村长，穷人饿的吃不住劲，到地里剜菜、摘豆，被他吊打、夺篮子、罚款，据说被吊打过的有二十多人。当时大街上的一棵大树上时常吊的就跟葡萄架一样，每天要夺四、五个篮子，罚款、罚粮食也都是他自己吃了。有的人说着就哭得说不下去了。李保恩诉说时，下边好多人都流了泪。说了五十多件以后，还有不少老实农民没把心里的话都说出来，这时夜已很深，大家说：“说到天明也说不完，先讨论怎么处理他吧。”大家酝酿以后把意见提出来，农会委员会商议后决定：先要他答复两件事：给人摘“特务帽子”；保证不报复。关于贪污部分，要和他算帐，其他案件，将来送交人民法庭处理。未处理前，除了上自己地里生产，要在家里好好反省，不许在街上乱串，不许威胁、报复。少数人还是沾染着过去的坏作风，要求给王克斌身上“挂牌”，要求立即把他“扣起来”、“吊起来”；大多数群众对这不感兴趣，说：“过去他吊咱吊错了，咱不再吊人。”当主席团（农会委员）给大家说：“咱们没有扣人权，该扣也得让政府扣”的时候，只有少数人一时“泄了气”。过后群众反映：“还是不扣对、不扣他，看他还能怎么着咱！咱群众组织起来了，指上他廿个王克斌也不行！咱不团结，扣住他还能扣一辈子？放出来还会报复”。第二天下午，又给傅高林提意见。有少数人有私人报复情绪。这次会也显示出发动的还不够；在给王克斌提意见时，旧“积极分子”不说话，群众说话还较多；给傅高林提意见时，少数人一嚷，群众说话就又少了。开过这会后，工作组就抓紧这个实例让群众讨论：处理的是不是公道？群众都起来当家了没有？老实农民没当家有啥害处？怎样才能当好家？………这样，成立农代会就成了群众自己的要求。
    全村分成了三十一个农代会小组，每组先选出三个代表候选人，经贫农团委员会审查，批不准的有四个人。当天（二十二日）下午，选出正式代表（每组一人，共三十一人，其中贫农九人，新中农十六人，老中农六人），晚上就开了第一次农代会，由农会委员担任主席团，农会主席担任农代会主席。大会讨论了三件大事：决定新的村政府的组织系统；要求支差公平；要求代耕办法公道。前两件事都解决了，后一件决定以后召开军属会议大家讨论后再作决定。二十二日上午，各小组酝酿了村政委员候选人，下午就召开村民大会选举。为了使每一个人都能真正表达他自己的心愿。这次大选举是采取个人登记办法：先把候选人的名单写好十几张，工作员和驻村机关的几位同志每人拿一张，每人负责两个小组，一个一个的把选民叫到一边，让他悄悄的说要选谁，工作员在名单上划记号。候选人排着坐在台上，有些人不知道候选人的“大号”的，就让他说是台上的第几个。这样选举的结果，从十六个候选人里选出九个村政委员。从这次选举可以看出：（一）老实贫农最受拥护，两个票数最多的是贫农团委员。（二）党员一般也是受拥护的，选出的九个人中有三个党员。（三）“大换班”的鼓动者失败，选出的九个人中有五个是前任干部。（四）上下街宗派意见更减少了，寨上虽然选民人数少，也有三个当选。（五）中贫农是很团结的，老中农也有三个当选。
    群众对选举的方法满意，说：“这可真民主了！”对选举的结果也很满意，宣布了当选的人的名字后，全场轰起一片欢笑和欢呼。他们觉得真是选上了心上的人。当选的人向群众征求意见的时候，群众喊：“没意见，领着干吧！”有的当选的委员说：“咱可是没办过事，不知道办成啥事办不成。”群众喊：“大家帮助您！”
    当选的村政委员最初还是觉得“担子重，压的慌”；有的说：不会说话；有的说：不识字；有的怕太忙，地没法种；有的还是别的委员或组长，怕一个人干好几样，干不了。经过群众给他们鼓气，工作组也向他们解释，办了几天事情以后，他们心里沉重的感觉已经减轻不少；有些人办事还生疏，但是是起劲的、认真的、民主的；干部们正开始养成新作风，村子里正开始出现新面貌；新干部正领导群众进入填补运动。
