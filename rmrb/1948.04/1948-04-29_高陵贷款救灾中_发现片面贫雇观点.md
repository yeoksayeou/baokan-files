[News from JiluYu Region] Gaoling County has suffered severe famine due to enemy looting and crop reductions from last year's drought, affecting over 250 villages. After cadres participated in party rectification, middle peasants generally expect to borrow their own grain, and are even less inclined to produce. In Beiliu Village, Third District, one middle peasant who intended to engage in business had prepared the capital but has now stopped. Not collecting manure is a common phenomenon, and excessive eating and drinking are also prevalent. Poor peasants have nothing to eat and lack the strength to work and produce. After the district cadres promoted the Land Law during the loan distribution, the mood of the middle peasants improved slightly. Some who previously wanted to sell their livestock have changed their minds, and others are considering taking out loans to buy livestock. However, due to the past serious harm to the middle peasants, they are still skeptical until they see that we are genuinely changing our actions towards them. Some middle peasants in the Fourth District said, "What you're saying this time sounds good, but I wonder if you can do it?"

In this loan-for-relief effort, the general practice is for higher-level cadres to directly connect with and mobilize poor and hired peasants to take out loans. Some middle peasants who should have received loans were also connected, but they received very little. Some workers, upon hearing someone was a poor or hired peasant, would lend whatever amount was requested, but would ignore middle peasants. Some even bluntly said, "This time, middle peasants shouldn't even think about getting a loan." Last time, when transporting public grain to the sandy area as a work-for-relief measure, some middle peasants in the Second District, who were also starving due to the disaster, were not asked to transport the grain; only poor and hired peasants were called upon. The middle peasants said, "We can't get loans, and we're not asked to transport public grain. We're not asked to contribute our labor. Are we just supposed to starve to death?" Some even said, "Even if we eat a斗 [dǒu, a unit of dry volume] from you, we'll return two!" Although the idea of uniting with the middle peasants was later raised, and the difficulties of some middle peasants were resolved, the formalism in the work forced all the middle peasants who could not get loans to attend meetings, resulting in many middle peasants being unable to afford the time and feeling very depressed. A middle peasant in the Fourth District said, "The little sparrow flies with the bat at night, straining its eyes but getting nothing to eat." Middle peasants in Minzhai said, "All we do is attend meetings; we don't get anything. It's better to dig for maogen [a type of plant root] in the sandy area." Some poor peasants were afraid of middle peasants participating in the discussions, fearing that there would be fewer resources for them if there were more people, and were unwilling to lend to middle peasants. We did not conduct good education in this regard, committing tailism. In addition, many comrades have a purely task-oriented view, and do not actively organize the masses to produce and save themselves. They are unclear about the purpose of the loan, thinking that as long as it is given to the poor and hired peasants, that's enough, and they don't care what happens after that. Some comrades also emphasize mutual aid, saying, "If we lend you money, you must engage in mutual aid." Because the masses suffered losses in past large-scale mutual aid efforts, they now think that mutual aid is a way to manipulate them. Some people in the Fourth District said, "Lending us this little bit of money, and you still want to manipulate us!" The people of Xinzhuang said, "Don't even mention it; let us form our own mutual aid groups, and we guarantee we won't leave the land barren." The county committee, after discovering these problems, is now studying solutions.

### 高陵贷款救灾中  发现片面贫雇观点

    高陵贷款救灾中
    发现片面贫雇观点
    【冀鲁豫消息】高陵县由于敌人抢掠和去年天旱减收，造成严重灾荒，现受灾者二百五十余村。这次干部参加整党回来，中农普遍估计要借自己的粮，更无心生产。三区北六村一个中农想做买卖，把本都准备好了，现在又不做了。不拉粪是普遍现象，大吃二喝的也不少。贫农没吃的，也无力劳动生产。区干部在贷款中宣传了土地法以后，中农情绪稍有提高，有以前想卖牲口的不卖了，还有的想贷款买牲口。但因过去严重伤害中农的影响，当他们还没看到我们真正对中农在行动上有所转变时，还是半信半疑的。四区有的中农说：“这回说的不错，不知能做到不？”
    这次贷款贷粮救灾中，一般是上级干部直接找贫雇串连贫雇来贷。也串连了部分该贷款的中农，但贷的很少，有些工作员一说是贫雇，说贷多少就贷多少，一说是中农，就不管了。有的干脆说：“这回贷款，中农就不用打算着使。”上次向沙区东运公粮，以工代赈，二区有些中农，因受灾同样没饭吃，但我们光叫贫雇运，不叫中农运。中农说：“贷款没俺的事，运公粮又不叫运，出力也不叫出，可该俺饿死啦！”还有的说：“哪怕俺吃您一斗，还您二斗哩！”以后虽然提出团结中农，解决了一部分中农的困难，但因工作上的形式主义，强迫不能贷款的全体中农陪着一直开会，结果，许多中农耽误不起时间，很苦闷。四区一个中农说：“小家雀跟着夜蝙蝠飞，有熬的眼，没吃的食。”珉砦中农说：“光叫开会，得不到东西，还不如到沙窝里挖毛根去哩。”贫农有的怕中农参加讨论，怕人多了自己得的少，不愿贷给中农，我们也没很好的进行教育，犯了尾巴主义。另外，有许多同志是单纯任务观点，不积极组织群众生产自救，对贷款的目的性不明确，贷到贫雇手里就行，贷下去就不管了。还有的同志强调互助，“贷给你款你就得互助。”因为过去群众在大互助中吃了亏，现在一提互助，群众就认为是摆治他。四区有的群众说：“贷给这两个钱，还得摆治摆治啊！”辛庄群众说：“你们别提，俺自己成立互助吧，保险荒不了地。”县委会发现这些问题后，现正研究解决。
