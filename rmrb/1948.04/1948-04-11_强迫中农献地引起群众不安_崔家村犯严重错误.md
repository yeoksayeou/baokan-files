Forcibly Demanding Land from Middle Peasants Causes Public Anxiety
　　Cuijia Village Committed Serious Errors
　　[Taihang News] The working group of the Second District of Pingding discovered that the village cadres of Cuijia Village violated the decision that no land redistribution should occur in production villages, secretly and forcibly coercing middle peasants to "voluntarily" donate land, which affected production. On March 16th, the working group of the district convened a meeting of key cadres from various villages to study and promote production work. Cui Pu, the deputy village head of Cuijia Village, said in his report on the situation in his village: "The masses in our village spontaneously rose up at the newspaper reading meeting and 'voluntarily' contributed more than 40 mu of land. After this 'voluntary' action, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has increased even more!" After listening to this, the working group felt that there must be a problem and immediately sent someone to investigate the situation in his village. According to preliminary understanding, Cui Pu's report was false. The real situation is as follows: The village has a total of 89 households, 284 people, 858.3 mu of land, and produces 577.8 shi of grain, with an average of 3 mu of land and 2.043 shi of grain per person. Before the start of spring plowing, someone reflected: "Sooner or later, it will be a matter of taking from the rich to supplement the poor, so why not do it early and avoid delaying our spring plowing." Wang Zhaoyin, the chairman of the peasant association, said after hearing this: "I don't think we should do this." The deputy village head, Cui Pu, continued: "You are a cadre, don't you understand what the masses want! This is everyone's opinion." The chairman of the peasant association said nothing more. He immediately took the lead in reporting a "voluntary" contribution of 5.51 mu of land. Wang Yuyin said, "My land is more than others, so I have to 'volunteer' too!" At a village meeting held on the fifth day of the first lunar month, overseen by the deputy village head Cui Pu and the former public security officer Cui Xinsheng, the volunteer teacher Wang Zhu held a list and read out the names, calling on those named to "volunteer". A total of 17 households "volunteered", including 11 middle peasant households, 5 well-to-do middle peasant households, and 1 new middle peasant household, "volunteering" a total of more than 50 mu of land, producing more than 58 shi of grain; and "volunteering" more than 19 mu of orchard land, producing more than 17 shi of grain. How exactly did these people "volunteer"? A widow named Zhang Runni, with a small daughter, had even begged for food for a year in the past. Her family had 4.65 mu of land, producing 4.4 shi of grain, and last year she was allocated more than 1 mu of orchard land, producing 1.34 shi of grain. During the meeting, the cadres sent someone to call her to the meeting to "volunteer." She was afraid and "volunteered" the orchard land she had been allocated. When asked if she was willing, she said, "The cadres asked me to 'volunteer,' how could I not be willing?" Wang Yonghui also "volunteered." His family of five had 15.5 mu of land, producing more than 13 shi of grain, and he "volunteered" 6.9 mu, producing more than 7 shi of grain. The situation of "volunteering" was the same as Zhang Runni's. After "volunteering" this land, the masses were very uneasy. Landowners, even those who had only slightly more land, were preparing to "volunteer" and dared not produce boldly.

　　强迫中农献地引起群众不安
  　崔家村犯严重错误
    【太行消息】平定二区工作团发现崔家村村干部违犯生产村不搞填补决定，偷偷强迫中农自动献地，影响生产。该区工作团于三月十六日，召开各村主要干部会议，研究推进生产工作。崔家村村副崔浦在汇报他村的情况时说：“俺村群众在读报会上自发起来‘自动’出土地四十余亩，经过‘自动’以后，群众生产劲头更大了！”工作团听了以后，觉得一定有问题，马上派专人去他村调查情况。据初步了解崔浦的报告是假的，真实情况是这样：这村共有八十九户，二百八十四口人，土地八百五十八亩三，产粮五百七十七石八，每人平均地三亩，产粮二石零四升三。在春耕开始前，有人反映说：“早晚也是个抽肥补瘦，不如趁早干吧，看误了咱们春耕。”农会主席王招银听到后说：“我看咱不要这样做。”村副崔浦接着说：“你是个干部，还不认识群众要怎样呀！这是大家的意见。”农会主席听了再也没说啥，马上自己先报“自动”出地五亩五分一。王玉银说：“我的地也比别人多，也得‘自动’哩！”在正月初五日召开全村会时，由村副崔浦，旧公安员崔新盛掌握，义务教员王柱拿着名单子念，叫有名字的“自动”。总共“自动”的有中农十一户，富裕中农五户，新中农一户，共十七户，“自动”出土地五十亩多，产粮五十八石多；“自动”出果实地十九亩多，产粮十七石多。这些人究竟是怎样自动的？一个寡妇叫张润妮，还有一个小女两口人，过去还讨过一年饭，她家有地四亩六分五，产粮四石四，去年分到果实地一亩多，产粮一石三斗四。开会时，干部派人叫她到会上去“自动”，她害了怕，就把分的果实地“自动”了。问她你愿意不愿意，她说：“伢叫我去‘自动’我怎不愿意？”王永会也是“自动”了的，他家五口人，十五亩五分地，产粮十三石多，他就自动了六亩九分多，产粮七石多。“自动”的情形也和张润妮一样。“自动”出这些土地后，群众都很不安，稍微多一点土地的翻身农民都准备往出“自动”，更不敢大胆生产。
