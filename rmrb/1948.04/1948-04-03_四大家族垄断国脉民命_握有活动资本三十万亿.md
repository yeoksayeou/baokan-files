Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st Dispatch: Shanghai News: According to materials published by the Chiang bandit officials, since the Chiang bandit launched the counter-revolutionary civil war, the financial monopoly of the four families has expanded unprecedentedly, while the private financial industry has shrunk dramatically. In terms of deposits, the various deposits of the Chiang bandit's seven banks and treasuries (referring to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, Central Trust, Postal Savings Bureau, and the "Central Cooperative Treasury") alone (including ordinary, trust, savings deposits, and reserve funds deposited by commercial banks and firms) reached over 13 trillion 9.22 billion yuan (Chiang currency) by the end of June last year. However, during the same period, the total deposits of all commercial banks and firms (including many semi-official banks controlled by the four families) and Chiang bandit provincial, city, and county banks (also under the control of the four families) in the entire Chiang-controlled area totaled only 1 trillion 429 billion yuan, which is less than one-ninth of the former. That is, the seven banks and treasuries accounted for more than 90% of all deposits. The proportion of commercial banks and firms would be less than 5% if the deposits of banks controlled by the four families were excluded. Before the war, in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the deposits of Chiang bandit's "national" and "chartered" banks accounted for only 42% of all deposits, and in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), they accounted for only 59%. Financial monopoly expanded during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but its proportion did not exceed 80%. The seven banks and treasuries of the four families enjoy the special privileges of issuing banknotes and acting as agents for the Chiang bandit "national treasury," that is, they expanded their deposit amounts by using the counter-revolutionary civil war and inflation policies. Among the 13 trillion yuan in deposits at the end of June, "ordinary deposits" accounted for about 12 trillion (11,969.7 billion) yuan, of which more than 80% were Chiang bandit government "public funds," that is, newly issued Chiang currency. The total amount of the above deposits reached 20 to 25 trillion yuan by the end of last year (according to the Chiang bandit's "Central Bank Monthly Report" in January this year). These huge deposits are the funds for the four families to expand their control over private industrial and commercial activities and engage in hoarding and speculation. According to the Chiang bandit official announcement, the total amount of loans issued by the seven banks and treasuries reached 19 trillion 114.6 billion yuan by the end of June last year, of which "agricultural loans" used to control agricultural products accounted for more than 527.7 billion yuan, "securities investment" used to control the securities market amounted to 1 trillion 75.4 billion yuan, and "discounting" used to control private industry amounted to 503.4 billion yuan. The so-called "ordinary loans" amounted to 17 trillion 88.45 billion yuan. The total amount of the above loans reached more than 30 trillion yuan by the end of December last year. This huge amount of liquid capital, often exceeding 30 trillion Chiang currency, obtained through abuse of power for personal gain, is one of the main tools for the four families, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, to engage in hoarding and speculation, monopolize the nation's lifeline and people's livelihood, and exploit the blood and sweat of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas.

　　四大家族垄断国脉民命
  　握有活动资本三十万亿
    【新华社陕北一日电】沪讯：据蒋匪官方公布材料，自蒋匪发动反革命内战以来，四大家族金融独占已空前扩大，而民营金融业则已极度萎缩：以存款而论，仅蒋匪七行局库（按即中、中、交、农四行，中信、邮储两局及“中央合作金库”）之各项存款（包括普通、信托、储蓄存款及商业行庄缴存准备金），去年六月底即达十三万亿零九百二十二亿余元（蒋币，下同）；但同期全蒋区商业行庄（其中还包括四大家族控制下的许多半官银行）和蒋匪各省市县银行（按亦在四大家控制下），合计存款总额不过一万四千二百九十亿元，后者仅合前者九分之一弱，即七行局库共占全部存款百分之九十强。商业行庄所占比重，若将四大家族控制的银行存款除出，估计将不足百分之五。但战前民国二十三年蒋匪“国立”及“特许”银行存款仅占全部存款百分之四十二，民国廿五年亦仅占百分之五十九，抗战期中金融独占已形扩大，但其比重亦未超过百分之八十。四大家族七行局库由于享有发钞及代理蒋匪“国库”特权，亦即利用反革命内战与通货膨胀政策而扩大其存款数量，六月底十三万亿存款中，“普通存款”约占十二万亿（一一九、六九七亿）元，其中百分之八十以上均为蒋匪政府“公款”，亦即新发之蒋钞。上项存款总额，截至去年底更达二十至二十五万亿元（据今年一月蒋匪“中央银行月报”）。这些庞大的存款，就是四大家族扩张控制民间工商业活动及从事囤积居奇的资金。据蒋匪官方公布，截至去年六月底止七行局库放款总额共达十九万一千一百四十六亿元，其中用以控制农业产品之“农贷”占五千二百七十七亿余元，用以控制证券市场之“证券投资”为一万零七百五十四亿元，用以控制民营工业的“贴放”为五千零三十四亿元。而所谓“普通放款”则为十七万零八百四十五亿元，上项放款总额至去年十二月底更达到三十余万亿元之巨。该项由于假公济私而获得的经常在蒋币三十万亿元以上的巨大活动资本，就是以蒋介石为首的四大家族从事囤积投机、垄断国脉民命，借以榨取蒋区人民血汗的最主要的工具之一。
