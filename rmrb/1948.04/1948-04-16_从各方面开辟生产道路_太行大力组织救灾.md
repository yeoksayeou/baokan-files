　　Opening Up Production Roads from All Sides
  　Taihang Vigorously Organizes Disaster Relief
    [News from Our Newspaper] The disaster situation in various parts of Taihang is still developing. According to a February survey of 34 villages in Shouyang, Second District, out of 850 households and 2,795 people, 192 households and 631 people had no food. By the time of spring plowing, this number increased by 379 households and 1,355 people, an increase of two times. In the severely drought-stricken and enemy-affected 31 villages in the border area of Taigu, about 20,000 people will not have enough food until the wheat harvest. In the more severely affected villages of Yuci, a survey in the first half of the month showed 1,500 people without food, which increased to 2,500 people in the second half of the month, and may increase to 10,000 after spring plowing. Some people are grinding bran and white clay into flour to eat. In the First District, Yuan氏, Zan皇, Lincheng, Neiqiu,邢台, Gaoyi, and other six counties, there are large areas affected by famine. In Yuan氏 alone, there are 22,820 disaster victims in urgent need of relief. The situation in the border areas is even more serious. Due to repeated devastation by the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan warlord bandits, many homes are empty, and coupled with the prevalence of diseases, begging and death are already occurring. Moreover, the masses in the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan occupied areas are also fleeing to our area, further increasing our difficulties. In the vicinity of Anyang, more than 300 people have fled and requested resettlement or are begging for food in the liberated areas. Similar situations exist in Yuci and Taigu in the Second District. The prevalence of diseases has also continued to expand the disaster. According to statistics from only 15 villages in Shouyang, out of 628 households and 2,016 people, 64 died from illness, and 192 are still sick. This kind of natural and man-made disaster seriously threatens the masses and affects spring plowing and production. These situations have attracted serious attention from local leaders, and in leading the masses to fight against the disaster, preliminary results have been achieved. The specific methods and experiences are as follows: First, mobilize various economic forces to support mass weaving. The First District proposed guaranteeing weaving profits, with the trade company, central exchange, and county cooperatives responsible for unified prices, unified procurement, leading peddlers, and opening up sales channels. Weaving in other areas has also been launched under the slogan of self-salvation through production. For example, the Yuci County Cooperative spent 600 catties to support disaster victims' production. Second, non-disaster areas support disaster areas. For example, the Second District assigned fewer military shoe tasks to non-disaster areas, collected part of the shoe funds, mobilized women in disaster areas to make more military shoes, and issued labor and material costs to find production outlets for disaster victims. The First District raised bran, vegetables, and grain from non-disaster areas to support disaster areas. Third, use local conditions to organize the masses to carry out various production activities. For example, Yuci produces a large quantity of licorice, and 100 to 200 dan of relief grain were used for procurement. Handing in one jin of wet licorice can earn one *guan sheng* of miscellaneous grain, and each person can dig four jin per day, which can support three or four people. Taigu mobilized the masses to chop firewood, using 250 dan of relief grain as capital, specializing in procurement and turnover, and organized the masses to boil saltpeter, opening more than 20 saltpeter workshops. Yuci used loans to organize the masses to carry out porterage and transportation. Others, such as Zan皇 transporting grain, Shouyang transporting rails, and Yuan氏's Che Wanggou firing pottery, opened up production roads from all sides and found ways for the masses. Fourth, combine local construction projects to organize work relief and disaster relief. In addition to work relief projects such as repairing railways and highways, small-scale projects have also been carried out in various places. For example, Taigu used 50 dan of relief grain to open canals and repair water mills, and Yuci organized 300 people to repair roads in Zuoquan, which are all good methods. Fifth, organize doctors to go to the countryside to treat diseases. The Shouyang Disaster Relief Committee organized doctors to go to the countryside. The first batch has already been sent in two groups, and the second batch is being prepared. Sixth, solve difficulties and promote spring plowing and sowing. Yuci has organized specialists to purchase seeds (barley, peas, spring vegetable seeds, and other early-maturing crops) in the interior and lend them to the masses. The Fifth Special District Office instructed various counties to solve the cotton seed shortage and called on all counties to plant more spring vegetables and early-maturing crops. In terms of organizational leadership, counties in Yuci, Taigu, and other places organized production and disaster relief committees, districts established leading groups or production and disaster relief groups, and villages established production and disaster relief committees, under which there were production and disaster relief, organization and mutual assistance, and other departments. The leadership paid attention to overcoming bureaucratic work styles, preventing false reports and exaggerating the number of disaster victims, and preventing phenomena such as carelessly dealing with matters without concern for the suffering of the masses.

　　从各方面开辟生产道路
  　太行大力组织救灾
    【本报消息】太行各地灾情目前仍在发展，据二分区寿阳三十四个村二月份调查，共八百五十户、二千七百九十五人中，当下没吃的即有一百九十二户、六百三十一人，到春耕期间，又增加三百七十九户、一千三百五十五人，增加了二倍。太谷边沿区受旱灾敌灾较重的三十一个村，吃不到麦收的有二万人左右。榆次较严重村前半月调查没吃的一千五百人，后半月即增至二千五百人，春耕后可能增到万人。有的群众用糠和白土磨成面吃。一分区元氏、赞皇、临城、内邱、邢台、高邑等六县，都有大部灾荒地区，仅元氏即有急需救济的灾民二万二千八百二十人。边沿地区则更严重，由于蒋阎顽匪反复摧残，十室九空，加以疾病流行，乞食死亡现象已在发生。而蒋阎占区群众，亦相率逃来我区，更增加我们困难。安阳附近逃来要求安置或到解放区乞食者已达三百余人。二分区榆、太等地也有同样情形。疾病流行，也使灾荒继续扩大，仅据寿阳十五个村统计，共六百二十八户、二千零十六人中，病死者六十四人，尚在病中的一百九十二人。此种天灾敌祸，严重威胁群众，影响春耕生产。这些情况已引起各地领导的严重注意，在领导群众与灾荒进行斗争中，并已获有初步成效。其具体办法及经验有以下几点：第一、动员各种经济力量，扶植群众纺织。一分区提出保证纺织利润，由贸易公司中心交易所和县联社等负责，统一价格，统一收买，带领小贩，打开销路。其他各地纺织，在生产自救的口号下，都已展开。如榆次县联社花六百斤支持灾民生产。第二、非灾区支援灾区。如二分区在非灾区少派军鞋，征收一部鞋款，在灾区发动妇女多做军鞋，发给工料费，为灾区群众找生产出路。一分区由非灾区募糠、菜、粮食支援灾区。第三、利用当地条件组织群众进行各种生产活动。如榆次出产大批甘草，即以一百石到二百石救济粮进行收买，交一斤湿甘草，能赚杂粮一官升，每人每天刨四斤，即能养活三四口人。太谷发动群众砍柴，以二百五十石救济粮作资本，专门收买周转，并组织群众熬硝，开设硝房廿多处。榆次以贷款组织群众担挑运输。其他如赞皇运粮，寿阳运铁轨，元氏车王沟烧盆等，从各方面开辟生产道路，为群众想办法。第四、结合地方建设事业，组织工赈救灾。除修筑铁路公路等工赈外，各地亦有小规模的进行，如太谷以五十石救济粮，开渠修水磨，榆次组织三百人到左权修路等，都是很好的办法。第五、组织医生，下乡治病。寿阳救灾委员会，组织医生下乡，第一批已分两组下去，第二批正在准备中。第六、解决困难，推动春耕下种。榆次已组织专人到内地购买种籽（大麦、豌豆、春菜籽等早熟作物）贷给群众，五专署指示各县解决棉籽困难并号召各县多种春菜及早熟作物。在组织领导上，榆次太谷等地，县组织生产救灾委员会，区设领导小组或生产救灾小组，村生产救灾委员会，下设生产救灾、组织互助等股。领导注意克服官僚主义作风，防止假报告多报灾民及不关心群众痛苦草率从事等现象。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（敬庭）
