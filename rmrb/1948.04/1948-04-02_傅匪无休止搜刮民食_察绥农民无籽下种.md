Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st -- Comprehensive reports from Tianjin newspapers: Bandit Fu Zuoyi, in order to ingratiate himself with the bandit Chiang Kai-shek and demonstrate his counter-revolutionary "achievements," is relentlessly squeezing the people's food in Chahar and Suiyuan, plunging both provinces under Bandit Fu's rule into extreme famine. Last month, Bandit Fu confessed in a conversation with the Chiang bandit social bureau chief and others in Beiping that last year alone, he had plundered 110,000 tons (equivalent to 2.2 million city dan) of grain from the people of Chahar and Suiyuan at low prices for military use for the Chiang bandit. He is now planning to squeeze another 100,000 tons (2 million city dan) for the Chiang bandit's use. In just over ten days, from January 27th to February 9th, Bandit Fu colluded with the Chiang bandit's Central Grain Company to plunder over 1,100 tons of grain. Last year, Bandit Fu extorted a total of 320,000 city dan of land tax in the Chahar and Suiyuan provinces under his rule, not including the exorbitant miscellaneous taxes that were several times the land tax. The pro-Chiang bandit Tianjin Yishibao also admitted that Bandit Fu is treating his controlled areas as a "rear warehouse" for the Northeastern and North China Chiang-Fu bandit armies, endlessly squeezing them. As a result, the people in Bandit Fu's controlled areas are living in misery. The price of flour in Zhangjiakou rose 69 times from 200 yuan per jin in January of last year to 14,000 yuan per jin this January. Currently, the prices in the city are on par with those in Beiping and Tianjin. The price of wheat in Guisui soared to 220,000 yuan per dou (30 jin) last month, and has continued to rise sharply since then. The situation in the rural areas under Fu's occupation is even more tragic. According to Yishibao: In the rural areas of Suiyuan under Fu's control, although the spring plowing season has arrived, there are very few farmers hoeing the fields and spreading manure. The first difficulty is that most of the young and strong farmers have been conscripted into the army, leaving only the old, weak, and women. The second difficulty is the lack of livestock and seeds. Farmers have been forced by poverty to sell and slaughter their oxen, and their seeds have been seized for military grain. Farmers in the Fu-controlled areas of Chahar Province are also "sighing at the land" due to the lack of seeds and funds.

　　Another dispatch: In Datong County, under the rule of Bandit Yan Xishan, grain and general merchandise have generally increased in price due to Bandit Yan's exorbitant taxes and levies. Prices rose by 30 to 40 percent in just ten days during the Lunar New Year. Most stores cannot bear the heavy apportionments, and even during the Lunar New Year, when business should be booming, many general merchandise stores, restaurants, watch shops, and western medicine shops have closed down. Two movie theaters have also suspended performances for this reason.

　　傅匪无休止搜刮民食
  　察绥农民无籽下种
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】综合津报消息：傅匪作义为献媚蒋贼，表现他的反革命“成绩”，尽量搜刮察绥民间食粮，已使两省傅匪统治区城乡陷于极度粮荒中。上月傅匪在北平与该市蒋匪社会局长等谈话中供认：去年一年已在察绥替蒋贼贱价掠夺充作军用的粮食达十一万吨（合二百二十万市担），目前更拟再搜刮十万吨（二百万市担）供蒋匪支用。仅一月二十七日至二月九日十多天中，傅贼与蒋匪中粮公司勾结进行掠夺的粮食即达一千一百余吨。至去年傅贼在察绥两省统治区勒索田赋则共达三十二万市担及数倍于田赋的苛杂尚不在内。亲蒋匪之天津益世报亦承认：傅匪将其统治区作为东北及华北蒋傅匪军的“后方仓库”加以无休止的搜刮。结果已使傅匪统治区民不聊生。张家口的面粉价格，去年一月至今年一月上涨六十九倍，由每斤二百元涨到一万四千元，刻该市物价已与平津并驾齐驱。归绥小麦月前每斗（三十斤）亦涨达二十二万，其后更跳跃上涨。傅占区农村情况更是凄凉，据益世报载：绥远傅区农村，虽春耕时期已到，田里很少农民锄地布粪，第一个困难是青壮农民都已被拉去当兵，只剩老弱妇女；第二个困难是畜力和种子缺乏，农民因穷困所迫，耕牛早出卖宰杀了，种子被抢作军粮了。察省傅区农民亦因种子及资金无着而“望地兴叹”。
    又讯：阎匪统治的大同县城因阎匪横征暴敛，粮食及百货普遍上涨，仅旧历年节十天内物价上涨百分之三、四十。一般商店不堪繁重摊派，虽在理应生意兴隆的旧历年关，许多杂货铺、饭铺、钟表店、西药铺等反而纷纷关门歇业，两家影剧院亦因此而停演。
