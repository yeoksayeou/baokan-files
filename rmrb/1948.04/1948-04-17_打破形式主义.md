The situation revealed in today's news from Hongtiji and Xixiazhuang should attract the serious attention of comrades in all regions who are leading production work. This situation shows how urgently we need to truly listen to the demands and voices of the masses and bravely break with formalism in our work!

In the past, although we have achieved successes in organizing production, the problems that exist on the other hand cannot be ignored. The biggest problem is the formalism created by the coercive command style, which has seriously separated us from the masses. This formalism is satisfied with the enumeration of inaccurate figures and with superficial displays. In the past, not only was it not exposed or opposed, but it has always been praised and eulogized. The bureaucracy above does not understand the situation below; the lower levels cater to the preferences of their superiors, describing things that are harmful to the masses as beneficial, and saying that things that violate the demands of the masses are voluntary, telling lies with their eyes closed (not just empty talk). And some leaders, even though they know things are not quite right, still insist on the errors, continuing to talk nonsense, deceiving their superiors, restricting the masses, and creating false reports and "ghost stories." In the past, our newspapers, due to unclear viewpoints and insufficient research, were not vigilant enough against false reports and speculative thinking, so that many reports fell into the trap of "ghost stories." Not only did they fail to expose the faces of bureaucrats and formalists, but they also put makeup on them. For example, last year we introduced the "land shares" of Shagu, Shuhe several times, saying that it was creative, but actually promoted destructiveness and blindness. The masses said it was "three lines of defense." And the "three major combinations" that the newspaper has published more than once in the past are now said by the masses to be "three major fatal things." How alarming is this!

Recently, due to the expansion of democratic influence since the rectification campaign, the masses have dared to reveal a little of their true demands that they "have never dared to say," and we should listen to and value these opinions of the masses with a very responsible attitude, bravely and boldly negate the old ways, and honestly follow the principles constantly suggested to us by Chairman Mao, and lead the masses in production according to the mutually beneficial policy of true need and free will of the masses. Anything that violates this policy is not allowed; in addition, allowing things to drift for fear of making mistakes again is also not allowed.

We believe that the problems in the three major combinations in Hongtiji and other places are not just isolated phenomena. Please, places that have not yet discovered problems, put down the baggage of bureaucracy and formalism, pay attention to listening to the voices of the masses, boldly correct all errors according to the demands of the masses, rectify and develop mutual aid, and launch this year's production movement on the basis of the true needs and free will of the masses!

### 打破形式主义

　　打破形式主义
    今天虹梯关、西下庄消息所透露的情况，应该引起我们各地领导生产工作的同志严重注意。这种情况，启示我们要真正听一听群众的要求与呼声，来勇敢的打破工作中的形式主义，已是何等迫切的事情！
    过去我们在组织生产中，虽说是有成绩的，但另一方面存在的问题也确已不容忽视，其中最大的是强迫命令作风所造成的形式主义一套，已经严重的脱离了群众。这种形式主义，满足于不确实的数目字的罗列，满足于形式上的铺张，过去不惟没有被揭穿被反对过，而且一直是被表扬被歌颂着，上边官僚主义不了解下情；下边即投上所好，把对群众有害的说成有利的，把违反群众要求的说成自愿的，闭着眼睛说谎话（不仅仅是说空话）。而在某些领导上虽也明知不大对头，还要坚持错误，一直胡说下去，欺哄上级，限制群众，假报告、客里空都因此而生。过去我们报纸，由于观点的模糊与研究不够，对假报告与投机思想警惕不够，以致不少报导陷入“客里空”的圈套。不但没有戳破官僚主义与形式主义者的面目，而且还给它搽上了粉。比如去年我们曾几次介绍沙河束沟“土地入股”，说是创造性，实际助长了破坏性、盲目性。群众说它是“三道封锁线”。而报纸过去不只一次登过的“三大结合”，今天却也被群众说是“三大要命”。这是多么值得警惕！
    最近由于填补整党以来，民主影响的扩大，群众才敢于把他们“一直不敢吭”的真实要求吐露一点，我们应以十分负责的态度，听取与宝贵群众这些意见，勇敢大胆的否定旧的一套，老实的依照毛主席不断提示我们的原则，按群众真正需要与自愿、完全等价的互助政策来领导群众生产，一切与这政策相违反的东西都是不容许的；另外，因怕再犯错误而放任自流也同样是不容许的。
    虹梯关等地三大结合中的问题，我们觉得这不只是个别地方的现象，请还没发现问题的地方，放下官僚主义形式主义的包袱，注意倾听群众的呼声，根据群众要求大胆纠正一切错误，整顿与发展互助，在群众真正需要与自愿的基础上，开展今年的生产运动！
