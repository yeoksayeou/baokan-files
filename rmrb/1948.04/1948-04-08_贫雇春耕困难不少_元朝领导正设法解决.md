　　Poor and Hired Peasants Face Many Difficulties in Spring Plowing
  　Yuan Dynasty Leadership is Working to Solve Them
    [Yuan Dynasty News] Spring plowing is urgent. It is understood that poor and hired peasants still have many difficulties in production. Some households have no food, and some have to go out to beg. For example, in Nanzhuang, District 3, there are two households begging for food. In Xisong Village, out of 120 households, 60 are starving. In Shundaodian, District 2, out of 480 households, 56 have little to eat. In Qian Guanzhuang, 36 households are starving. Several households selling small amounts of rice at the market in Jintan Town sell out quickly, proving that farmers are eating a lot of grain bought in small quantities. Another difficulty is the lack of draught animals, farm tools, and seeds, especially for the elderly and weak, who have no strength to solve these problems. Yue Suitang from Wu Jiahe said, "The manure hasn't been taken to the fields yet; it's getting late." He requested mutual aid and loans to solve the difficulties. Another important problem is that village cadres are not properly leading production. Bai Zilin, the director of the farmers' association in Yanzhuang, District 3, doesn't work and keeps eating and drinking at his small meat shop. The village cadres in Genglou engage in factionalism and don't care about the landlords dispersing their belongings. In order to solve these difficulties and problems, the county has taken some necessary measures: In addition to lending 20 million yuan, the unallocated fruits of labor have also been distributed to the masses for production. According to statistics from Districts 1, 3, 5, and 6, more than 4.8 million yuan has been distributed (with 490,000 yuan not yet distributed). This distribution method involves cadres directly visiting and finding poor and hired peasants, allowing the masses to determine the loan recipients and amounts based on their relative hardship. To solve the land difficulties, 120 mu of land belonging to the Zhanglu Hui Muslim Mosque has also been distributed to poor and hired Hui Muslims. Statistics from 24 villages in District 5 show that 476 mu of fruit-bearing land have solved the land problem for 127 households, and 490,000 yuan in loans have solved the difficulties for 73 households. In this way, the problems of food, seeds, and farm tools have been partially solved. Regarding the difficulty of draught animal power, the masses have created the following methods: (1) Zhang Pei Wang, a poor and hired peasant in Daozhuang, uses grass to exchange for the use of Wu Jiangling's cattle power. This not only solves the difficulty of plowing for the poor and hired peasants but also solves the difficulty of feeding livestock this year due to the high price of grass, preventing the need to sell livestock. This method is common in many villages, benefiting both middle and poor peasants. Bai Zhangqi in Baizhuang uses crushed grass (bean skins, wheat bran, etc.) to exchange for long-term draught animal power from cattle-owning households. (2) Mutual aid teams absorb poor and hired peasants through equal exchange, bringing together those with and without cattle. Because of the large disparity in land ownership, poor and hired peasants initially feel disadvantaged, but combining this with the use of cattle owners' livestock for sideline occupations makes it reasonable. (3) Zhang Xiuyun, a widow in Li Maling, takes apart clothes for sewing and spins cotton to exchange for cattle power and manpower from Zhang Cun. The masses have many other ways to solve their problems. (Zhang Rong, Zhi Shen, Sha Ye, Jing Chen)

　　贫雇春耕困难不少
  　元朝领导正设法解决
    【元朝消息】春耕紧迫，据了解贫雇生产还有好些困难，有些户没吃的，个别还要出去讨要。如三区南庄有二户要饭，西宋村一百廿户人家，有六十户挨饿；二区顺道店四百八十户人家，五十六户没啥吃；前官庄卅六户挨饿；金滩镇集上好几户卖零米的卖的很快，证明农民零籴粮食吃的很多。再一个困难是耕畜、农具、种籽缺少，特别是老弱的更没力量解决。吴家河岳遂堂说：“粪还没往地拉，可不早了。”他要求互助和贷款解决困难。另一个重要问题是村干不好好领导生产，三区阎庄农会主任白字林，不干活，开着小肉铺不断吃喝；耿楼村干闹宗派，地主疏散东西他们也不管。为解决这些困难和问题，县里作了些必要措施：全县除贷二千万款外，没分的果实也分给群众生产。据一、三、五、六、四个区统计，分下去四百八十余万（尚没分的四十九万）。这次的分法是干部直接访苦找贫雇，从比苦中让群众自己确定贷款对象和数目。在解决土地困难上，张鲁回民清真寺一百二十亩地也分给贫雇回民。五区二四个村统计，果实地四七六亩，解决了一百二十七户地的问题；款四十九万，解决了七十三户的困难。这样吃饭、种籽、农具问题，已得到局部解决。在畜力困难上，群众有这样几点创造：（一）道庄贫雇张培望，用草换中农吴江岭的牛力。这样一方面解决贫雇耕地困难，同时也解决了今年因草贵喂不起要卖牲口的困难，这个法好多村庄都有，中贫农两合算。白庄白张起用碎草（豆皮麦糠等）给牛户换长期耕地畜力。（二）互助组的吸收贫雇等价交换，有牛的和没牛的在一块。因土地悬殊大，贫雇起初觉着吃亏，但结合副业使用牛户牲口也就合理了。（三）李马陵寡妇张秀云拆做衣服纺花与张存换牛力和人力。群众自己解决的方法还很多。（张荣、志深、沙野、敬辰）
