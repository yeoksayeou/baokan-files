Xinhua News Agency, Yushane'e Front, 16th -- A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army universally launched a discipline inspection movement after the Luoyang campaign. In the enthusiastic and strict inspections from top to bottom, a large number of discipline-abiding model heroes and discipline-abiding model units were selected. Two battalions of a certain regiment had 230 discipline-abiding heroes. During the battle of Luoyang, they always maintained the noble qualities of the People's Army without any violations. When the eighth squad of the sixth company of a certain regiment searched for underground tunnels in the city, the ground was full of large and small packages, various cigarettes and candies, but no one touched them. When prisoners voluntarily handed over pens, watches, gold rings, etc., fighter Yu Baoliang refused, saying, "We are the People's Liberation Army, we don't want your things. Surrender your weapons and you are good brothers. Put your things away." The prisoners were so moved that they shouted, "Support the People's Liberation Army." Wang Changsheng, a model party member and squad leader of the special service company of a certain regiment, tore his pants in battle, but he did not take a single piece of clothing when he went back and forth to transport ammunition in the city, and was selected by the whole class as a first-class discipline-abiding model. The seventh squad of the seventh company of a certain regiment did not eat lunch when marching after taking Luoyang. The company headquarters asked each squad to borrow grain from the landlords and return it the next day. But the seventh squad's landlord was poor, so everyone said, "Let's go hungry, we'll eat tomorrow." After speaking, they took off their clothes and went to sleep, and the squad was thus rated as a model squad. All members of the sixth squad of the company smoked, and this time in Luoyang City, merchants voluntarily offered cigarettes for them to smoke, but they politely declined, saying, "We have our own local tobacco." The sixth squad, a discipline-abiding model selected by the machine gun company of the second battalion of a certain regiment, fought from Dongguan to the streets inside the city. They only ate one meal in two days and two nights. They saw a grocery store full of food, but no one touched it. Deputy squad leader Li Wenxiu said to the whole squad: "We can't eat the merchants' things even if we are hungry. We make plans and resolutions in ordinary times, let's see if we can stand the test today." All the soldiers of the squad immediately guaranteed to the squad leader: "We have the courage to make plans, and today we have the determination to implement them." The female boss of the grocery store said movedly: "I have lived for forty or fifty years, and I have never seen such a good army as you."

　　攻打洛阳部队严格遵守群纪
  　表现解放军高贵品质
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十六日电】解放军某部于洛阳战役后普遍展开查纪律运动。在上下热烈严格的检查中，评选了大批遵纪模范功臣和遵纪模范单位。某团两个营就有二百三十位遵纪功臣，他们在洛阳战斗中始终保持着丝毫无犯的人民军队的高贵品质。某团六连八班搜索城内地洞时，满地都是大小包袱、各种纸烟和糖果，但没有一个人去摸一摸它。俘虏自动交出钢笔、手表、金戒指等，战士于宝亮拒绝说：“我们是解放军，不要你们的东西，缴了枪就是好弟兄，快把你们的东西收起来吧。”俘虏都感动得高呼：“拥护解放军。”某团特务连班长模范党员王长生，在战斗中裤子破了，但他来往城内运送弹药没有拿一件衣服，被全班选为甲等遵纪模范。某团七连七班打下洛阳行军时没吃下午饭，连部叫各班在房东处借粮，次日归还。但七班房东较穷，于是大家说：“饿一顿吧，明天再吃。”说罢脱下衣服就睡，该班因而被评为模范班。该连第六班全体都会吸烟，这次在洛阳城里商民自动拿出烟卷让他们抽，他们婉谢说：“我们自己带有土烟。”某团二营机枪连选出的遵纪模范第六班，他们从东关打到城内街上，两天两夜只吃了一顿饭，看见一家杂货店里摆满吃食，却没有一个人去动一下。副班长李文秀向全班说：“我们再饿也不能吃商人的东西，我们订计划和决心都在平时，看今天我们能不能经得起考验。”全班战士立即向班长保证说：“我们有勇气订计划，今天就有决心去实行。”杂货店的女老板感动得说：“我活了四、五十岁，还没有看见过象你们这样好的军队。”
