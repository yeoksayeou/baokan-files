Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: After the liberation of Zhoucun City, an industrial and commercial hub along the Jiaoji Railway, new street leaders have been democratically elected in all fourteen main streets, actively promoting municipal administration. The democratic provincial and municipal governments' announcements regarding policies for newly liberated cities and support for developing industry and commerce have been deeply embraced by merchants. All factories have begun operations, and the electric and flour companies will soon fully resume operations. The credit of the Beihai currency is increasing daily, with each yuan exchanging for 50 yuan in Kuomintang currency. Two million two hundred thousand Beihai yuan were exchanged in just two days. Prices have generally decreased, with the price of general local products dropping by about half. Pork prices dropped from 2,600 Beihai yuan per catty to 1,600 Beihai yuan, and steamed buns dropped from 2,400 Beihai yuan per catty to 1,800 Beihai yuan. After the Industrial and Commercial Administration sold 160,000 catties of grain at low prices, prices became more stable, and impoverished citizens received relief. In addition to receiving family subsidies, electrical workers can also receive two catties of grain per day.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: Democratic order has rapidly recovered in Weihaiwei City. After entering the city, the democratic government immediately issued a notice to reassure the people, held a meeting to reassure the people, and cooperated with the trade union to distribute 43,000 catties of grain and 2,000 catties of peanut cakes to relieve impoverished citizens. The third day was the first market day after the recovery of Weihai City. Farmers from the surrounding villages, 50 or 60 li away, transported large quantities of grain and firewood to the market. The crowds were dense, and the lively scene had not been seen in five months. Furthermore, the Industrial and Commercial Administration and the Weihai City Beihai Bank have decided to transport 200,000 catties of grain to regulate the market and plan to allocate 20,000 catties of soybeans to relieve the farmers in the suburbs of the city.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 13th: After the recovery of Weihaiwei City, the democratic government urgently loaned more than 4,000 catties of grain and oil each, and more than 5,600 catties of hemp rope and straw rope, and more than 700 catties of kerosene to help fishermen restore production. Now the fishermen are repairing boats and mending nets so that they can go to sea to fish when the fishing season arrives. The 11 fishing villages in the northern district of the city originally had 81 large fishing boats, 160 small fishing boats, and 883 fishermen. Last spring, thanks to the democratic government's fishing loans of more than 3 million yuan and the relief of 20,000 catties of grain, as well as active technical guidance, they had made a significant profit. After being occupied by the Chiang bandits last autumn, many boats and nets were destroyed. Fishermen were forced into service, which resulted in the failure to go to sea at the end of autumn, and the winter fishing season was also delayed. When the Chiang bandits fled on the 30th of last month, they robbed most of the people and boats. Now only 38 large boats, 89 small boats, and 358 fishermen remain. Either people and boats are both gone, or there are people without boats, or the boats are there but the people are dead.

　　山东周村市解放后
  　物价普遍下降
  　威市民主秩序迅速恢复
    【新华社华东十三日电】胶济线工商业重镇周村市解放后，十四条大街均已民主选出新的街长，积极推行市政。民主省市政府对新解放城市之各项政策和扶助与发展工商业的布告、深受商买拥戴。各厂商均已开始营业，电灯及面粉公司不日即可全部复业。北海币信用日益提高，每元兑换蒋币五十元，仅两天内即兑出北币二百二十万元。物价普遍下降，一般土产品约下降一倍左右，猪肉每斤由北币二千六百元降至一千六百元，馒头每斤由二千四百元降到一千八百元。工商管理局以低价出售粮食十六万斤后，物价更趋稳定，贫苦市民均获得救济，电气工人除领取家庭补助外，本人每日尚可领粮二斤。
    【新华社华东十三日电】威海卫市民主秩序已迅速恢复。民主政府进市后，即布告安民，举行安民大会，并协同工会发放粮食四万三千斤，花生饼两千斤，救济贫苦市民。三日为威市收复后第一个市集，五、六十里外的四乡农民挑运大批粮食柴草赶集，人群拥挤，热闹情景为五个月来所未见。另息：工商管理局和威市北海银行已决定运入粮食二十万斤，以资调剂，并拟拨豆子二万斤救济市郊农民。
    【新华社华东十三日电】威海卫市收复后，民主政府为帮助渔民恢复生产，特急贷粮食与油各四千多斤，麻绳、草绳共五千六百多斤，石油七百多斤。现渔民们正修船补网，俾渔泛到来时，即可下海捕鱼。该市市北区十一个渔村，原有大渔船八十一艘，小渔船一百六十艘，渔民八百八十三人。去年春，因得民主政府三百余万元渔贷和两万斤粮食的接济，以及技术上的积极指导，曾获厚利。去秋遭蒋匪侵占后，船网被毁甚多。渔民被驱迫服役，致秋末出海未成，冬季捕鱼期亦被耽误。上月三十日蒋匪临逃时，又连人带船抢走大半，现只幸存大船三十八艘，小船八十九艘，渔民三百五十八人，不是人船两空，便是有人无船，或船在人亡。
