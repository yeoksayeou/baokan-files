　　False Poor Peasant Leagues in Wuan Yingtun and Other Villages
　  Run Rampant, Causing Unrest
  　Commissioner Hou Proposes Resolutely Stopping Their Activities
    [Our Report] Comrade Hou Guoying, Commissioner of the Sixth Prefecture of Taihang, recently pointed out in his "Opinions on Overcoming the Current Chaotic Situation and Vigorously Shifting to Spring Ploughing Production":

    Around Qingming Festival, it is time to plant beans and spring ploughing production is the current urgent demand of the masses. Except for some areas that are carrying out land redistribution, party rectification, and democratic integration with production, most areas should focus all their efforts on leading the masses in production. According to our region, although most areas have begun to shift to spring ploughing production, chaotic phenomena are still constantly being discovered. For example, in the fourth district of Wuan, false poor peasant leagues in seventeen villages, including Yingtun, Bei Fengchang, Zhao Yao, Xi Yangyan, Yucheng, Bei Tiancun, Shagou, Dongxi Tongluo, Xujiapo, and Dongpo, are controlled by a few careerists and bad elements. They forced village cadres to confess, under the name of "Poor Peasants in Power", and ruled the masses. Without a permit from the poor peasant league, one could not leave the village. The Yingtun Poor Peasant League prepared to struggle against twenty middle-peasant households. The Ye× village poor peasant league elected a peasant representative conference to prepare for party rectification. Six demobilized soldiers from the villages of Cui Shimen and Shi Shimen gathered to eat at the cadres' homes. The fruits of past struggles were all wasted. They neither produced nor contributed grain or money. The masses reflected: "The demobilized soldiers have become masters again." Demobilized soldiers from the same league arbitrarily exchanged houses with the masses. The poor peasant league in that village organized a theater troupe, which has already spent two or three hundred thousand yuan. The cadres dare not say a word when they ask the cooperative for money. Huang Jushan replaced the village chief and the chairman of the peasant association, with the slogan: "Drive away outsiders." In Yangtoushan in the third district and Yingtun in the fourth district, a few bad elements led the masses to burn incense, worship gods, and seek medicine, instead of engaging in production. Some old men said: "Are we going back to the Qing Dynasty?" The masses in Bei Fengchang village in the fourth district reflected: "In the past, production mutual aid was done with a single breath. This year, we want to engage in mutual aid with middle peasants, but we are afraid that others will say we are 'agents of the landlords', we are really afraid of being burned if we go forward, and afraid of being cold if we step back. We are afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind, this is really a dilemma." Some village poor peasant leagues are catching adulterers everywhere. When they see village cadres walking on the street, they say: "You bowed down to the poor peasants, you are not allowed to raise your heads." The masses reflected: "Can this be considered a poor peasant league? This is the same as in the old days, we dare not raise our heads. What kind of democracy is this?" Such chaotic phenomena, although not widespread at present, seriously hinder the masses' spring ploughing production and the future development of land redistribution, party rectification, and democracy. It must be stopped immediately and quickly to stabilize the masses' production mood. Therefore, it should be clearly stated that the poor peasant leagues established in areas where no work teams have arrived are definitely impure. They are controlled by a few bad elements, bad cadres, and some careerists with private grievances and revenge motives, or by some landlords and rich peasants, who deceive the masses under the banner of "poor peasants," stir up trouble, and act lawlessly. Their conspiracies should be exposed through mass discussion, and their activities should be announced to be cancelled and stopped. This is not to attack the poor peasants, but to support righteousness, combat evil, stabilize the masses' mood, and powerfully promote the shift to production; and some particularly bad elements should be sanctioned and punished through the masses.

　　武安阳屯等村假贫雇团
　  横行霸道造成不安
  　侯专员提出坚决停止其活动
    【本报消息】太行六专员侯国英同志顷在“克服目前混乱现象大力转向春耕生产的意见”中指出：
    清明前后安瓜点豆，春耕生产已是群众的目前迫切要求，除一部地区在进行填补整党民主结合生产，其余大部地区应全力领导群众生产，根据我们专区大部地区虽已开始转向春耕生产，但目前混乱现象仍不断发现，如武安四区有阳屯、北冯昌、赵窑、西羊眼、玉城、北田村、沙沟、东西同罗、徐家坡、东坡等十七个村的假贫雇团，在少数野心家坏分子掌握下，强迫村干部作了交代，名曰“贫雇掌权”，统治群众，不经过贫农团开路条不能出村。阳屯贫雇团准备斗争二十户中农；野×村贫雇团选出了农代会准备进行整党；崔十门史十门两个村子六个荣退军人集合起来，到干部家中吃饭，过去分的斗争果实均浪费了，不生产也不出粮出款，群众反映：“人家退伍兵又成了老爷啦。”同会荣退军人随便换群众的房子，该村贫雇团组织了一个剧团，已花了二三十万元，到合作社要款干部不敢哼声。黄聚山把村长农会主席换了，口号是：“撵外来人。”三区阳头山、四区扬屯，少数坏分子领导群众烧香、敬神、求药、不生产，一些老汉说：“又要恢复清朝啦。”四区北冯昌村群众反映：“过去生产互助干的一鼓劲，今年想与人家中农互助，怕别人说咱是透气分子，真是靠前怕烧，退后害冷；前怕狼，后怕虎，这倒进退两难。”有些村贫雇团到处捉奸，见了村干部在街上走路即说：“你们向贫雇低下头，不准抬起来。”群众反映：“这还能算是贫雇团？这和过去见了老日子一样，头也不敢抬，这叫啥民主？”这样混乱现象，目前虽不普遍，但严重的障碍着群众的春耕生产及今后填补整党民主的开展，必须马上迅速制止，安定群众生产情绪。因此应明确提出：凡没有工作组到的地区成立起来的贫雇团，肯定的说是不纯，是被少数的坏分子坏干部及一些带有泄私愤图报复的野心家，或被一部地富分子掌握，挂着“贫雇”招牌，欺骗群众，兴风作浪，无法无天，应经过群众讨论揭露其阴谋，宣布取消停止其活动。这样作并非打击贫雇，这是扶植正气，打击邪气，稳定群众情绪，转向生产的有力推动；并对一些十分恶劣的坏分子，通过群众给以制裁、处分。
