Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Comprehensive reports: The U.S. imperialists' direct armed intervention in Greece over the past few months has suffered a serious setback. In October of last year, in order to rescue the dying Greek royalist fascists, the U.S. imperialists increased the number of American officers in the Greek puppet army above the battalion level. In mid-November, they established the "U.S.-Greek Joint Staff Headquarters for the Army, Navy, and Air Force." In mid-February of this year, they personally took control of all combat troops. The result was still of no avail. According to broadcasts from the Free Greece Radio, the disastrous defeat of the Greek puppet government forces in Epirus last month was under the direct command of U.S. officers. Over the past week, the head of the U.S. military mission in Greece, Follett, organized an encirclement of the Democratic Army in the Clotia Mountains (between Thessaloniki and the Yugoslav border), and boasted loudly about the "initial great victory of the spring offensive." However, the Athens puppet authorities revealed the truth, saying: "The guerrillas have now all escaped." The U.S. imperialist mouthpiece, the Associated Press, could not but admit: "The much-publicized initial spring offensive will be a big failure." On the 1st of this month, a Soviet News observer said: "The American ruling class is now trying to turn Greece into a strategic bridgehead in southeastern Europe. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that this American bridgehead is built on a volcano that could erupt at any time. The Greek people's will to fight for independence cannot be broken by force or dollars."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Free Greece Radio broadcast: General Markos, Prime Minister and Army Chief of the Greek Provisional Democratic Government, analyzed the Greek military situation at a cabinet meeting held on March 23rd, emphatically pointing out that the Democratic Army's recent victories in Epirus, Thessaly, and the Morea Peninsula were a resounding response to the royalist fascists' first spring offensive, and predicted that the Democratic Army would soon launch a more powerful attack on the enemy. General Markos said: For a month, a guerrilla force composed of patriots has broken through the enemy's heavy encirclement and interception from southern and central Greece, escorting refugees who escaped from the iron hooves of the royalist fascists, and victoriously crossed Mount Olympus (south of the Thessaly Plain) and moved to the liberated areas. This long march is the heroic achievement of patriotic people who are infinitely loyal to the people's cause. Many residents along the way joined this force. According to the Democratic Army war report: The Democratic Army launched an offensive in the Florina (northern Greece) area, capturing many enemies, and launched an attack in the Komotini (northeastern Greece) area, liberating two villages.

　　希民主军力量强大
  　美武装干涉遭挫败
    民主军将发动有力攻势
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合报导：美帝数月来对希腊的直接武装干涉，已遭到严重的挫败。去年十月间，美帝为了抢救希腊保皇法西斯的死亡，曾增派美国军官到营级以上的希腊伪军中去，十一月中旬又成立了“美希海陆空军联合参谋总部”，今年二月中旬更亲自掌握作战部队的全部指挥权，结果仍无济于事。据希腊自由电台广播，上月间希伪政府军在爱匹鲁斯的惨败，即在美军官直接指挥之下。一周来，美驻希军事使团团长佛力特曾组织了对克洛提亚山地（萨罗尼加与南斯拉夫边境之间）民主军的包围战，并大吹大擂“初期春季攻势的大捷”，但雅典伪当局却泄露了真情说：“游击队现已全部逃脱”。美帝喉舌合众社也不能不承认：“大大张扬的初期春季攻势，将是一个大大的失败”。本月一日，苏联消息报观察家说：“美国统治阶级现正进行把希腊变成它们在东南欧战略的桥头堡垒。但是，越来越明显，美国这一桥头堡垒是建立在随时都可爆发的火山上。希腊人民争取独立的意志，既不是以武力也不是用美元所能击破的”。
    【新华社陕北三日电】自由希腊电台广播：希腊临时民主政府总理兼陆长马科斯将军，于三月廿三日举行的内阁会议上，分析希军事形势，着重指出：民主军最近在爱匹鲁斯、色萨利和摩里亚半岛的连捷，是对保皇法西斯首次春季攻势的响亮回答，并预示民主军最近将对敌人发动更有力的攻击。马科斯将军谈称：一个月以来，有一支由爱国分子组成的游击队，从希腊的南部和中部，冲破敌军的重重包围和阻击，护送着从保皇法西斯铁蹄下逃脱出来的难民，胜利地越过奥林匹斯山（在色萨利平原南部），向解放区移动。这一次长途行军，是对人民事业无限忠诚的爱国志士的英勇功绩。沿途很多居民参加这支队伍。又据民主军战报：民主军在佛洛林纳（希北部）地区展开攻势，俘敌很多，并在科摩替诺（希东北部）地区进行袭击，解放了两个村庄。
