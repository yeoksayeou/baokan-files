　　Yuanshi Shouyang Addresses Spring Famine
　　Organizing the Masses for Production and Self-Salvation
　　[Yuanshi News] Yuanshi suffered from severe devastation and plunder by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits before liberation, resulting in a serious famine this spring. For example, in the sixth district, out of 23 villages with more than 4,800 households, over 1,012 households are currently without food. The situation is most dire in Fu Village, where out of 359 households, 84 households, or 24% of the village population, are currently starving. Some villages in the seventh district, near the sixth district, also face severe famine due to heavy looting by the enemy last year. According to statistics from the sixth district, Chengguan district, and the seventh district, approximately 2,267 households, comprising 13,500 people, are on the brink of starvation, with the sixth district being the worst affected. The famine is continuing to worsen. In Dongjiapu, seventh district, over a hundred people are already begging door-to-door. Furthermore, villages with severe famine planted little wheat this year. For example, in Jie Village, out of more than 60 hectares of land, only about 12 hectares were planted with wheat. The lack of experience in weathering famines further exacerbates the severity of the crisis. Due to the famine, social order is becoming unstable. Driven by hunger, some masses are resorting to theft. Some demand immediate struggle against landlords and rich peasants, and even want to struggle against rich middle peasants who have some grain and goods. With spring plowing upon us, some households are forced to sell their livestock to survive. Many households lack the food, farm tools, and other necessities to engage in production. Due to these circumstances, when the land law is mentioned, the masses universally demand that the problems of grain, livestock, and seeds be solved first, and then land. Some villagers demand that cadres immediately return excess gains and distribute the village's accumulated floating wealth. They also demand relief.
　　Based on the above situation, the county leadership has decided not to carry out equal distribution in the disaster areas for the time being, and to focus all efforts on production to overcome the famine. The main approaches are: production for self-salvation, and solving practical difficulties. Organizing sideline production activities such as spinning and weaving, engaging in small businesses, and opening oil mills. In agriculture, in addition to finding ways to solve the difficulties of livestock and seeds, some poor peasants and hired laborers who lack land can be temporarily allocated some of the land confiscated last year but not yet distributed. Ownership will be determined uniformly during the equal distribution. Villages with accumulated fruits and floating wealth should immediately distribute them. They should call for mutual assistance and mutual relief, plant more early-maturing crops, and collect wild vegetables and other substitutes for food. In addition to the above measures, the government is making great efforts to provide relief, and has decided to issue 200,000 jin of loan grain (allocated by the special commissioner's office), 75 million yuan in loans, 200,000 jin of bran, and 100,000 jin of vegetables. It is also organizing disaster victims to transport 800,000 jin of grain to Huolu City. In the relief efforts, the spirit of production for self-salvation will be implemented to overcome dependence and waiting attitudes. (Shichang, Bingzhang)
　　[Shouyang News] Since last autumn, Shouyang border areas have been continuously harassed by Yan Xishan's bandits, resulting in a failure to harvest most of the autumn crops, and the masses have been displaced, leading to severe famine and disease among the people in the border areas. The most common diseases are typhoid fever and scabies, as well as venereal diseases. For example, in Yang Village, out of 35 households with 150 people, 20 are currently sick and 19 have already died. In order to relieve the masses from spring famine and disease, a production and relief committee for disaster victims in the border area has been organized. Out of the 400 shi of relief grain allocated by the special commissioner's office, 200 shi have been allocated to alleviate the spring famine, and the remaining 200 shi will be used for relief after sowing. The main focus is on organizing the masses for production and self-salvation. In addition, a doctors' meeting was held to break through the old traditional thinking that "doctors are worthless if they are not sought out," and two medical teams were organized to go to the disaster-stricken and disease-ridden areas along the border to actively treat the people.

　　元氏寿阳解决春荒
  　组织群众生产自救
    【元氏消息】元氏因解放前，遭蒋匪掠夺蹂躏，形成今春严重的灾荒。如六区全区廿三个村，共四千八百余户，眼下即没吃的有一千零十二户。最严重的，如富村三百五十九户，当下没饭吃的八十四户，占全村户口百分之廿四。七区靠近六区的一部村庄，因去年敌抢掠厉害，灾荒也很严重。据六区、城关区、七区三个区统计，约有二千二百六十七户，一万三千五百人，马上没吃的，其中六区最严重。现在灾荒还在继续发展，七区董家铺，现已有百余人沿门讨饭；越是灾重的村，今年种麦子又不多，如解村六十余顷地，种麦不过十二顷。又加以这些地方缺少渡荒经验，更增加灾荒的严重性。由于灾荒引起社会秩序的动荡不安，部分群众因饥饿所迫，发生偷盗行为；有些要求马上斗争地主富农，甚至连有点存粮存货的富中农也想去斗。当前春耕已到，但有些户，还要卖牲口渡荒糊口；不少户因缺乏食粮、农具等，而无力生产。由于这些情况，一提到土地法，群众普遍要求先解决粮食、牲口、种籽等，其次才是土地。有些村群众要求干部马上退出多得果实，立即分村中存的浮财，要求救济。
    县领导上根据以上情况，确定灾区暂不进行平分，全力进行生产渡荒。在作法上主要是：生产自救，解决实际困难。组织纺织、干小生意、开办油坊等副业生产。在农业上，除设法解决牲口种籽困难外，有些贫雇缺少土地，可将去年没收未分之地暂分给他们些，平分时统一确定所有权。存有果实浮财的村，马上进行分配，号召互助互济，多种早熟庄稼，搜集野菜等代食品。除以上办法外，政府用大力进行救济，决定发放二十万斤贷粮（专署拨发的），七千五百万元贷款，二十万斤糠，十万斤菜；并组织灾民往获鹿城运输八十万斤粮。在救济中贯彻生产自救精神，克服依赖等待思想。（世昌、秉章）
    【寿阳消息】去秋以来，寿阳边地不断遭阎匪奔袭扰害，大部秋禾未收，群众转移生活困苦，形成了边地群众的严重灾荒与疾病。最多的是伤寒、疥疮等，还有花柳病。如杨村三十五户，一百五十口人，现病的二十口，已死了的十九口。为救济群众春荒疾病，特组织边区灾民生产救济委员会，把专署拨给的四百石救济粮，先拨下二百石救济春荒，留下二百石播种后再救济，主要是组织群众生产自救。另外，又召开医生会，打通过去的“医生找上门，不值半分文”的旧传统思想，组织了两个医疗小组赴边沿灾病区，主动为群众医治疾病。（办公室）
