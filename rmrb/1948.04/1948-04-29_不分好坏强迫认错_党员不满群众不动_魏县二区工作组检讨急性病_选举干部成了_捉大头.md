    【Wei County News】The work teams in Beiliugang Village and Renpian Village in the Second District of this county recently reviewed their work in organizing the masses and rectifying the Party. Both committed fairly serious errors of impatience, which caused widespread dissatisfaction among the masses and Party members. After the Renpian Village work team arrived in the village, they attacked the old village cadres regardless of the size of their mistakes, and ignored them. The masses felt that "these work team members are here to punish village cadres. It's really hard to be a cadre of the Eighth Route Army; you can't get any credit even if you do good work." The cadres complained, but the masses were not sympathetic. During the Party rectification, they did not understand the actual situation beforehand, nor did they study how to rectify or what the purpose of the rectification was. They simply moved the set of routines from the Party rectification meeting, aiming to suppress the village cadres so that the poor and hired peasants could approach them and dare to speak. The education for Party members with few or no mistakes was very poor. They were simply isolated and suppressed by the leadership. They were forced to admit mistakes. The leadership did not clarify the responsibilities for the mistakes made by Party members in their work. Everyone was dissatisfied after the meeting, and the poor and hired peasants were also silent. The leadership became impatient and used Wang Zhide, the original poor peasant representative, to register the number of poor peasant households. Out of 126 households in the whole village, 93 were registered. The leadership thought it was not pure enough, so they held another poor peasant meeting to publicize the Land Law and the "Letter to the Peasants". After four or five days, the masses were still unmoved. The leadership became even more impatient and found ten better-off poor peasants to let them connect with others, but these poor peasants also remained unmoved. The leadership then took over the task of establishing a poor peasant group, selected six good ones from those ten to review the list of names, and asked everyone to recognize the good and the bad. As a result, among the 93 households, 13 village cadres, two with connections to landlords, one who was away from home, one pseudo-family member, three who had been in the enemy's counter-settlement team, and eleven old middle peasants were removed. The work comrades asked: "Are the remaining ones qualified?" Chen Fa and Wang Chun, two poor peasants, said: "These are all honest people who can't speak well. If they were eloquent, we would have them bite together!" On March 13th, another poor and hired peasant meeting was held to conduct class education. Because the poor peasant group was not connected by themselves, everyone was simply attending the meeting to fulfill their duty, with one person from each family. Some women shed tears when they heard about the suffering they had endured in famine years. The leadership believed that they were awakened, and immediately held a poor peasant meeting to examine their class status. The poor peasants didn't even know what class status was! During self-reporting, no one spoke. Only Chen Herui said: "Let's shout slogans! Everyone must shout together if we want to say anything." As a result, the examination failed. In addition, when visiting poor and hired peasants, those who dared to reflect problems were considered not good people. They didn't want to listen to ordinary conversations at the homes of honest poor peasants, but wanted them to talk about the problems in the village. The work team members did not trust the masses and could not go deep. Every time they visited poor and hired peasants, they were worried and couldn't find the right people. They circled around outside the village, and when they got home, they said bitterly: "The masses are backward. Every village is better than this one. What can we do? "They said to each other:" We don't have the ability. We are just eating the public's millet for nothing." In addition, the Beiliugang work team recently said when reviewing their work that when they first arrived in the village and visited the poor and hired peasants, they found six people who all performed very well, so they asked them to connect with others. They quickly found 96 poor peasants. The comrades in the work team were very happy, thinking that this village was easy to manage and had no problems. They did not conduct good ideological education, nor did they deeply understand the ideological concerns of the masses. They proposed electing representatives at a plenary meeting to formally establish a poor peasant association. But the masses were unwilling to be elected as cadres, thinking that whoever was elected would be unlucky, and they regarded the election of representatives as "catching the big shots." The work team did not understand this situation and casually let the masses elect seven people. Shao Sheng's wife heard that Shao Sheng had been elected and anxiously came to the meeting place and said: "Are you still going to live? Who will feed the cattle for you? We won't be this!" After explanation, she still didn't understand. On the third day, she quarreled with Shao Hai (the leader of the poor peasant group) on the street, saying that Shao Hai had elected Shao Sheng. Shao Sheng happened to arrive, and he was so angry that he took off his clothes and wanted to fight Shao Hai. At this time, someone said, "Expel him!" The elected representatives said, "If he doesn't do it, we won't do it either." A meeting was held in the evening to ask the groups to discuss. Everyone said, "It's cheap for him if he doesn't do it. Anyway, he won't do it." The final opinion of the group was: Shao Sheng should admit his "mistake" and do whatever he was asked to do.

    不分好坏强迫认错
    党员不满群众不动
    魏县二区工作组检讨急性病
    选举干部成了“捉大头”
    【魏县消息】本县二区北刘岗村与任骈村两个工作组最近检讨组织群众与整党工作，都犯了相当严重的急性病错误，遭到群众与党员的普遍不满。任骈村工作组到村以后，对待老村干，不管错误大小，一律打击，撇开不管。群众认为“这些工作员是整村干的，八路军的干部真难当，干的天好也落不出好来。”干部喊冤，群众也不同情，整党时，事前一点也不了解实际情况，也没研究怎样整法，整党的目的是什么，只是简单把整党大会的一套搬来，目的是把村干压一下，贫雇就好接近了，敢说话了。对错误少的和没啥错误的党员，教育很差，光是领导上孤立的压，强迫党员说错误，党员为工作所犯的错误，领导上也没弄明责任，会后都不满意，贫雇也是不吭气。领导上急了，利用原来贫农代表王志得登记贫农户数，全村一百二十六户，登记了九十三户。领导上认为不纯，又开贫农会，宣传土地法和告农民书，过了四五天，群众还不动，领导上更急，找了十个较好的贫农，让他们串连，这几个贫农也不动。领导上就包办成立起贫农组，从那十个人里找出六个好的，来审查人名单子，叫大家公认好坏，结果九十三户中被查出去的有村干十三名，与地主有关系的两名，出外的一名，伪家属一名，给敌人当过倒算队的三名，老中农十一名。工作同志问：剩下的是不是够条件？陈法、王纯两个贫农说：“这都是老实不会说话的人，要是能说会道的，叫他一块咬咬吧！”三月十三号，又开了个贫雇会，进行阶级教育，因为贫农组不是自己串连起来的，都是支应公事，一家来一个人参加会。有的妇女听到灾荒年受的罪，就掉下泪来，领导上就认为她们觉悟了，紧接着开贫农会审查成份，贫农还不知啥是成份哩！自报时，大家都不发言，只有陈合瑞说：“咱们喊口号吧！要说啥大家都得一齐喊，”结果没有审查成。另外在访问贫雇时，敢反映问题的认为不是好人，到老实贫农家，说家常话不愿听，愿意叫他谈村里的问题，工作员不相信群众，深入不下去，每到访贫雇时就上愁，找不着对象，就在村外转圈子，到家就苦闷的说：“群众落后，那个村也比这个村强，你看有啥法呀！”互相说“咱没能力，白吃公家小米。”另外北刘岗工作组最近检讨工作时说，他们一到村访问贫雇，找到六个人，都表现很好，就让他们再串连别人，很快找到九十六个贫农。工作组的同志很喜欢，认为这村好办，没啥问题，也没进行很好的思想教育，也没深入了解群众的思想顾虑，就在全体会上提出选代表，正式成立贫农团。但群众谁也不愿被选当干部，认为选上谁谁就倒霉，把选代表当成“捉大头”。工作组不了解这种情况，马马虎虎让群众选了七个人。邵生的老婆听说选上了邵生，很着急的到会场上说：“你还过不？谁给你喂牛？咱不当这个！”经过解释，始终不通。第三天，她在大街上与邵海（贫农小组长）骂起来，说是邵海选的邵生，赶上邵生也来了，他正毒气不出，脱了衣裳要与邵海打架。这时有人说：“开除他吧！”被选上的代表们说：“他不干俺也不干。”晚上开了个会，叫小组讨论，都说：“他不干可便宜他了，反正不当不中。”小组最后的意见：叫邵生承认“错误”，叫他当啥他当啥。
