　　British Communist Youth League Congress
  　Condemns Attlee's Purge of Communists
　  Pollitt Calls for Struggle for Peace
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd -- London dispatch: The British Communist Youth League held its 15th National Congress last month, which concluded on March 29th. One hundred and ninety-eight delegates, representing 1,233 branches, attended. Representatives from the communist youth leagues of France, Spain, Norway, Canada, the West Indies, and Greece, as well as representatives from the World Federation of Democratic Youth, gave congratulatory speeches to the congress. Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, at the close of the congress, called on the youth to oppose war propaganda and to struggle for a lasting democratic peace. John Brocks, General Secretary of the British Communist Youth League, delivered a major report at the meeting. He condemned the Labour government's policies as being for the benefit of large corporations, which resulted in shamefully low wages for young workers. Millions of working-class families are saying, "We can't live on what we're paid." He also said, "The government's reduction of construction plans has caused 150,000 architects to lose their jobs; this unemployment is gradually increasing, especially in Scotland, Wales, and Liverpool." He vehemently criticized that "millions of British youth are forced to waste their time in the armed forces, or serve Bevin's dirty deals in Palestine, Greece, and other countries." Finally, Brocks, on behalf of the Youth League, called for "immediate wage increases for all young workers," and called on all delegates to fight the warmongers. Strengthen the unity of British and world democratic youth, and oppose fascism and reactionary forces in the struggle for peace and security. The congress also resolved to condemn the purge of communists in government agencies, demand intensified anti-fascist struggles, and express sympathy for the national liberation struggle of the Greek patriots.

　　英共青年团大会
  　斥艾德礼清洗共产党员
　  波立特号召为和平斗争
    【新华社陕北三日电】伦敦讯：英共青年团于月前举行第十五次全国代表大会，已于三月二十九日闭幕。与会者一九八人，代表一二三三个支部。法、西、挪、加、西印度、希腊等国共产主义青年团代表及世界民主青年联盟代表，都向大会致祝词。英共总书记波立特于大会结束时，号召青年们反对战争宣传，及为持久民主和平而斗争。英共青年团总书记布罗克斯在会上作主要报告，他谴责工党政府的政策是为了大企业家的利益，因而使得青年工人的工资可耻的低少。几百万的工人家庭都在说：“我们所拿的钱已经不能活命了”。他又说：“政府缩减建筑计划，已使十五万建筑师失掉工作；这种失业在逐渐增长，特别是苏格兰、威尔士与利物浦等地”。他猛烈抨斥：“百万英国青年被迫在武装部队中消磨时间，或者为贝文在巴勒斯坦、希腊及其他国家中的肮脏勾当效劳”。最后，布氏代表青年团呼吁：“立即为所有青工增加工资”，号召各代表与战争贩子斗争。加强英国与世界民主青年的团结，为争取和平与安全而反对法西斯与反动力量。代表大会并决议：痛斥政府机关中的清共，要求加紧反法西斯的斗争，对希腊爱国者的民族解放斗争表示同情。
