　　Chiang Kai-shek Gang Desperately Struggles with Unprecedented Brutality:
  　Xiuwu People Suffer Cruel Looting
    Democratic Government Saves the Disaster Victims Thriftyly and Organizes Refugees for Production

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Chiang Kai-shek bandits, trapped in Xiuwu and Jiaozuo, are desperately trying to make a last-ditch struggle, frantically looting everywhere. Several thousand people from the 40th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits stationed in Jiaozuo, along with their puppet Commissioner's Office, the Xiuwu Security Regiment, all puppet township governments, the Self-Defense Corps, and hundreds of landlords and despots led by the bandit puppet County Chief Xu Jingshan, carried out a brutal "mopping-up policy" against Xiuwu (north of the road) on the morning of March 23. After three days and nights of robbery, conscription, arson, and rape, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits looted everything they could find, digging three feet into the ground. Where they went, houses collapsed. In villages such as Mazhuang, 69 houses were burned down, and 23 young men were taken away. In Dongma Village, all four brothers in one family were captured. Hou Jinyu, chairman of the West Wanhai Farmers' Association, and his daughter were strangled to death by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and thrown into a dry well. Old people, children, and women who could not escape were all raped by the bandits. More than a dozen women who came to Tumen Palm to visit relatives were imprisoned in a room by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' 40th Division and raped in turns all night; even 14 and 15-year-old girls were not spared. In total, 135,646 catties of public grain millet, 550,489 catties of wheat, 2,369 square feet of homespun cloth, 451 pairs of military shoes, 885 catties of bean vermicelli, 725 catties of sweet potato vermicelli, and 372 catties of sea salt were looted. Only five administrative villages in Xiuwu County were spared by the bandits. The 29 administrative villages most severely looted have a total population of 12,895, who now have nothing to eat or drink and no means of production, which is several times more serious than in previous famine years. Preliminary statistics from just twelve natural villages show a total loss of 1,612.14 dan of grain (22 catties per dan in Xiuwu). In five small natural villages—Wei Village, Yiyao, and Cuizhuang—246 households with 923 people (equivalent to one and a half administrative villages) lost 494.7 dan of corn, 127.73 dan of millet, 74 dan of millet, 105 dan of mung beans, 86.15 dan of wheat, 35.4 dan of sesame, and 51.35 dan of other miscellaneous grains, totaling 908.2 dan, with grain losses exceeding 90%. The returning masses wiped away their tears as they picked up kernels of corn scattered on the ground by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The people of Yiyao Village killed dogs to satisfy their hunger. Under the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' scorched-earth policy, the masses' furniture and farm implements were completely destroyed. In six small natural villages, 699 pots, 253 water vats, 128 pairs of water buckets, and 138 kitchen knives were looted and destroyed, and other daily-use furniture was also completely cleaned out. Farmers had none of their plows, seed drills, or hoes for spring plowing. In addition, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits looted and burned 236 plows, 103 harrows, and 696 hoes in twelve villages. Seven other villages lost 584 pieces of farm equipment. Thirty-three households in Yiyao Village could not find a single plow or seed drill. Other items such as clothing, bedding, cotton, spinning wheels, looms, pigs, and sheep were all swept away, even the nails on the walls were pulled out. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' brutality, cruelty, and heinous crimes of placing the people in a desperate situation are unbearable to witness. The people in the area after the disaster hate them to the bone. An old woman whose family is in the army said: "I am sixty years old this year. When we attack Xiuwu City, I must go. I will write to my son and tell him to fight hard and avenge me." Currently, the Xiuwu Democratic Government and personnel from various agencies and organizations are rushing to the countryside to comfort the families of the victims, provide relief and resettlement to the disaster-stricken masses, saving six taels of millet per person per day, and the troops (barracks) saving two taels of millet per person per day. In addition to allocating grain for relief, the government is also trying to purchase various seeds and agricultural implements to organize the masses for production.
