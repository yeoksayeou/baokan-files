Democratic Forces in Italy
    Italy is about to hold a general election on the 18th of this month. Currently, the election struggle between the two camps in Italy is fiercely unfolding throughout the country. One is the People's Democratic Front of the democratic camp, and the other is the reactionary camp headed by Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party. The People's Democratic Front is led by the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party. It unites many parties and groups, including the "Labor Democratic Party," the Christian Social Party, and the "People's Republican Alliance." It also receives support from mass organizations formed in the country over the past two or three months, including factory management committees, land committees, the Democratic Municipalities Alliance, the Southern Democratic Congress, the "Garibaldi Vanguard Movement," the Christian Peace Movement, and the Women's Peace Congress.
    Under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, the Italian people's democratic forces are very strong. During the anti-fascist war, the people's guerrillas led by the Communist Party achieved many brilliant victories, recovered large cities such as Milan, and captured Mussolini alive. After the war, the Italian Communist Party participated in the government in 1945, leading the people to drive away the King of Italy, establish a democratic republic, and promote many social reforms. Its prestige among the people has been increasing, and its membership has grown to 2.28 million. The trade union under its leadership has seven million members and is allied with the Socialist Party, which has 900,000 members. Unified organizations have been established from the central to the local levels, jointly proposing a program for land reform, progressive labor laws, and the establishment of a democratic and independent country. It has further united the broad masses of the people, making the working class more united and consolidated, while the Socialist Party traitor Saragat's faction is completely isolated within the working class.
    When the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Catholic Democratic Party jointly formed the government in 1936, due to the unreasonable interference of foreign reactionaries and the support of domestic landlords and capitalists, Gasperi of the reactionary Catholic Democratic Party seized actual power. However, among the people, the democratic forces led by the Italian Communist Party continued to grow. In the Rome municipal election in November 1946, the democratic forces won. Last April, in the election in Sicily, the Italian Communist Party and the democratic forces again achieved victory. Conversely, Gasperi, due to the implementation of traitorous, anti-people, and reactionary policies and the brutal suppression of workers and peasants, the people recognized his ferocious face and he was in an unfavorable position.
    Between June and July last year, the Gasperi reactionaries, fearing the growth of the people's democratic forces, further sold themselves to the US imperialist bandits, selling out a large amount of national sovereignty. At the same time, they expelled the Communist Party from government agencies, openly colluding with fascist elements hiding in various places, and engaging in anti-communist and anti-people activities.
    Italy was already impoverished by the war of aggression. Later, the British and American occupation forces plundered a large amount of "occupation fees," making the people's lives even more difficult. The result of the Gasperi government's implementation of traitorous and anti-people policies made the situation in Italy even worse. A large amount of American goods poured in, domestic production sharply declined, causing serious inflation, soaring prices, and a sharp increase in unemployment to 2.5 million, leaving the broad masses of the people completely in a state of starvation.
    Under these circumstances, the Italian people could no longer endure it and heroically rose up to fight against US imperialism and its running dog, the Gasperi government. From August last year to now, labor strikes have been continuous, on a scale unprecedented in Italian history. For example, in the Rome general strike, almost all workers participated, bringing all transportation, telecommunications, and production in Rome to a complete standstill, turning it into a dead city. The strike organization was very strict. The workers organized pickets and command posts, controlling and occupying factories and government agencies. During the strike, the workers showed solid unity. Regardless of the threats and deceptions of Gasperi and Saragat, they used stones and sticks to resist the police's suppression. Bloody clashes and street battles occurred in many cities, demonstrating the working class's tenacious fighting spirit. For example, the workers of Naples forcibly disarmed all the police, destroyed the organs of the Catholic Democratic Party and the monarchist party, and fascist newspaper offices, and burned fascist books and newspapers. In the past, the worker's forces in northern Italy were large, and the south was more quiet, but in the large-scale strike movement at the end of last year, the southern workers also showed a high degree of awareness. For example, in the province of Puglia, there was a general strike of 200,000 agricultural workers, resisting the landlords' excessive rents, confiscating the landlords' land, and carrying out land reform. The workers' movement and the peasants' struggle were combined for the first time in Italy.
    After the large-scale winter strike last year, under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, in order to further unite and consolidate their camp and greet even greater combat missions, the National Congress of Peasants and Agricultural Workers was held in Bologna on December 21. Six thousand representatives from various regions participated, and urban and rural working people became more united. Then, on the 28th, the organization of the People's Democratic Front was officially established. This signifies that the struggle of the Italian working people to win democratic independence and oppose the traitor Gasperi and US imperialist aggression has developed to another new stage. The People's Democratic Front is not a joint organization of party and faction leaders, but a mass-based people's organization, a new organizational form for the unity and cooperation of all democratic forces in Italy. In a short period of two or three months, the Italian People's Democratic Front movement has rapidly expanded throughout Italy. For example, local committees of the People's Democratic Front have been established in Turin, Genoa, Milan, Pescara, Florence, and many other places. Many lower-level members of Italian reactionary parties, such as the Republican Party, the Saragat Party, and the Christian Democratic Party, have also joined these committees. At the same time, the Italian Women's League was also established in Rome, calling on women to participate in the People's Democratic Front to fight for various women's rights. The Italian democratic forces have now become unprecedentedly strong, indicating that the awareness of the broad masses of the Italian people is increasing day by day; and it will prove that all conspiracies of the reactionary alliance group of Gasperi, the Vatican, and Saragat to prevent the development of the people's democratic forces and turn Italy into a US imperialist colony will fail.
    In January of this year, the Italian Communist Party convened its Sixth National Congress. A total of 782 delegates participated in the conference, representing 2,283,048 party members. The conference clearly pointed out that the current combat tasks are to fight for democracy, peace, independence, and economic revitalization. The conference exposed the conspiracy of warmongers to provoke civil war. Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti pointed out at the meeting with great confidence that the democratic forces are now strong. As long as they are not intimidated by the enemy, the reactionary party's conspiracy to provoke civil war can be defeated. At the same time, the conference made a very detailed discussion on election strategies. Nica, the spokesperson of the Italian Communist Party's Political Bureau, declared that the Italian Communist Party's strategy in the future lies in mobilizing the masses through the People's Democratic Front to repel and defeat the reactionary party's offensive.
    On the eve of the election, the People's Democratic Front launched a broad election campaign. On the 14th of this month, the National Women's Association, a component of the People's Democratic Front, organized 30,000 democratic women in Rome to hold a large demonstration against warmongers and submitted a declaration for peace signed by two million women to the Italian President. Milan also held a People's Democratic Front election rally with 50,000 people. The "Garibaldi Vanguard Movement," which has 600,000 members, is even more active. Italian General Confederation of Labor Secretary Vittorio strongly claimed at the People's Democratic Front election rally in Bari that the People's Democratic Front would end Gasperi's rule in the general election. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti said with even greater confidence at the People's Democratic Front election rallies held in Naples and Genoa that when the new parliament convenes, the Gasperi government "will no longer be the government of Italy."
    As the general election approaches, the people's democratic forces are growing rapidly, and the US and Italian reactionaries are extremely panicked. US imperialism, colluding with its servants Britain, France, and the Vatican, is using all kinds of despicable and shameless means to interfere. Truman and Marshall have successively made speeches, stating that if the Communist Party wins in the new parliament, US imperialism will no longer provide Italy with any assistance, in order to threaten the Italian people to elect the Gasperi reactionaries. At the same time, US warships cruise the Mediterranean Sea, entering and leaving the ports of Grande and Trieste; Gasperi expanded the police and mounted police composed of fascist elements to 200,000, attempting to implement election intimidation with arms. The reactionary forces of the Vatican are even threatening to excommunicate voters who oppose the Christian Democratic Party. And even more shameless is the suggestion by the US, Britain, and France to hand over the port of Trieste to Italy as a bait for the Italian people to elect Gasperi. But the US still feels that it is not sure of success with all these shameless measures. Recently, US Ambassador to Italy Dunn has disregarded the status of a diplomat and personally busied himself for Gasperi, calling on the Italian people to vote for Gasperi. Italian democrats suspect that US imperialism has become mentally deranged from being frightened by the strength of the Italian people's democratic forces.
    As the election period approaches, the struggle between the two camps in Italy will intensify day by day.

### 意大利的民主力量

　　意大利的民主力量
    本月十八日，意大利即将举行大眩目前意大利国内两个阵营的选举斗争已在各地激烈展开。一个是民主阵营的人民民主阵线，另一个是以加斯贝利的基督教民主党为首的反动阵营。人民民主阵线是由意共社两党领导，它团结了许多党派及团体，其中有“劳工民主党”、基督教社会党及“人民共和联盟”等。并得到过去两三个月在国内组成的人民群众团体的支持，其中有工厂管理委员会、土地委员会、民主市镇同盟、南方民主大会、“加里波的先锋运动”、基督教和平运动、妇女和平大会等。
    在意共领导下，意大利人民民主力量是十分强大的。在反法西斯战争期间，共产党领导的人民游击队，取得了许多辉煌的胜利，收复了如米兰那样的大城市，活捉了墨索里尼；战后意共于四五年参加政府，领导人民赶走了意王，创立民主共和，并推动实行了许多社会改革，在人民中威信日益增高，党员发展到二百二十八万人。她领导下的职工会，拥有七百万会员，并与拥有九十万党员的社会党联合。从中央到地方，都建立了统一的组织，共同提出实行土地改革，实行进步的劳工法，建立民主独立国家的政纲。更团结了广大人民，使工人阶级内部更加团结巩固，而社会党叛徒萨拉盖特派，则在工人阶级中完全处于孤立。
    当三六年共产党、社会党、天主教民主党共同组织政府的时候，由于外国反动派的无理干涉及国内大地主、大资产阶级的支持，反动派天主教民主党的加斯贝利窃取了实权，但在人民中，以意共为首的民主力量却继续增涨着。四六年十一月罗马市选中，民主势力获得了胜利。去年四月，西西里岛的选举，意共和民主力量又得到胜利。相反的，加斯贝利由于执行了卖国的反人民的反动政策，残暴的压迫工人、农民，人民认清了他的凶残面目，而处于不利的地位。
    去年六七月间，加斯贝利反动派恐惧人民民主力量的增涨，更进一步卖身投靠美帝国主义强盗，大量出卖国家主权，同时把共产党从政府机关里排挤出去，公开与各地隐藏着的法西斯分子勾结，进行反共反人民的勾当。
    意大利在侵略战争中，本来就拖得民穷财尽了，以后英美占领军又搜刮了大量“占领费”，人民生活更加困苦不堪。加斯贝利政府执行卖国反人民政策的结果，使意大利情形变得更糟，美货大量涌来，国内生产锐减，造成严重的通货膨胀，物价高涨，失业人数激增到二百五十万，广大人民完全陷于饥饿的境地。
    在这种情形下面，意大利人民再也不能忍受，英勇的起来和美帝国主义及其走狗加斯贝利政府斗争。从去年八月到现在，工潮一直连绵不断，规模之大，是意大利历史上没有过的。如罗马总罢工，差不多全部工人都参加，使罗马一切交通、电讯、生产完全陷于停顿，变成一座死城。罢工组织非常严密，工人们组织了纠察队、指挥部，控制、占领了各工厂和政府机关。罢工中，工人表现了巩固的团结，他们不顾加斯贝利、萨拉盖特之流的威吓与欺骗，用石头、棍棒反抗警察的镇压，在许多城市里发生流血冲突和市街战，表现了工人阶级顽强的斗争精神。如那不勒斯工人，强迫解除了警察的全部武装，捣毁天主教民主党、保皇党等机关和法西斯的报馆，并烧毁宣传法西斯的书报。过去意大利北部工人势力大，南部较沉寂，但在去年年底的大规模罢工运动中，南部工人也表现了高度的觉醒。如蒲克里省，便有二十万农业工人总罢工，反抗地主的过高租税，没收地主土地，进行土地改革，工人运动和农民斗争第一次在意大利结合起来。
    去年冬季大罢工后，在意共领导下，劳动人民为了进一步团结巩固自己的阵营，迎接更大的战斗任务，十二月二十一日在波伦亚举行了农民与农业工人全国大会，参加的有各地代表六千人，城乡劳动人民更趋团结一致。接着于二十八日便正式成立了人民民主阵线的组织。这表示着意大利劳动人民为争取民主独立，反对卖国贼加斯贝利及美帝国主义侵略的斗争，已经发展到了另一个新的阶段。人民民主阵线不是党派领导机关的联合，而是一个群众性的人民团体，是意大利一切民主势力团结与合作的新组织形式。在短短的两三个月时间内，意大利人民民主阵线运动，已在全意各地迅速扩展。如都灵、热那亚、米兰、贝斯加拉、佛罗伦萨及其他许多地方，都已成立人民民主阵线的地方委员会。意反动政党，如共和党、萨拉盖特党和基督教民主党的下级党员，参加这些委员会的也不少。同时，意大利妇女联盟也在罗马成立，号召妇女参加人民民主阵线，以争取妇女的各种权利。意大利民主力量现在已经无比壮大，说明意大利广大人民的觉悟日益提高；并将证明加斯贝利、梵蒂冈、萨拉盖特的反动联合集团企图阻止人民民主力量的发展，把意大利变成美帝殖民地的一切阴谋都将失败。
    今年一月，意共召开了第六次全国代表大会。参与大会代表计七百八十二人，代表二百二十八万三千零四十八个党员。大会明确指出当前的战斗任务，是为民主、和平、独立及经济复兴而奋斗。大会揭发了战争贩子挑动内战的阴谋。意共总书记托格里亚蒂在会上极具信心的指出：现在民主力量是强大的，只要不被敌人吓唬住，反动派挑起内战的阴谋是可以打垮的。同时，大会对选举策略，作了极详尽的讨论。意共政治局发言人尼加维宣称：意共今后的策略，在于经过人民民主阵线发动群众，击退并打垮反动派的进攻。
    选举前夕，人民民主阵线展开了广泛的竞选运动。本月十四日，人民民主阵线组成部分之一的全国妇女协会，在罗马组织三万民主妇女，举行反对战争贩子的大示威，并以有两百万妇女签名的争取和平宣言递交意总统。米兰也举行了五万人的人民民主阵线竞选大会。拥有六十万会员的“加里波的先锋运动”，更为活跃。意总工会书记维特瑞奥在巴利市的竞选大会上，力称人民民主阵线将在大选举中结束加斯贝利的统治。意共领袖托格里亚蒂在那不勒斯及热那亚举行的人民民主阵线竞选大会上，更满怀信心的说：到新国会开会时，加斯贝利政府“就不再是意大利的政府了”。
    大选日益临近，人民民主力量迅速增长，美、意反动派极为恐慌。美帝与其从仆英、法及梵蒂冈勾结一起，正用尽一切卑鄙无耻手段，进行干涉。杜鲁门、马歇尔先后发表演说，声言如果共产党在新国会里获胜，美帝将不再给意大利以任何援助，以威胁意大利人民选举加斯贝利反动派。同时美舰逡巡于地中海，出进大兰多、的里雅斯特港；加斯贝利由法西斯分子组成的警察及骑警扩大到二十万人，企图以武装实行选举恫吓。梵蒂冈反动势力更以开除反对基督教民主党的选民教籍相威胁。而更无耻的，是美英法建议以的港交给意大利，作为对意人民选举加斯贝利的钓饵。但所有这些无耻的措施，美帝仍觉得没有成功的把握。最近美驻意大使邓纳已顾不得外交官的身份，意亲自为加斯贝利奔忙，叫意大利人民投票选举加斯贝利，意民主人士都怀疑美帝已为意人民民主力量的强大而吓得神经失常。
    随着大选期的逼近，意大利两个阵营的斗争，当会日益加剧。
