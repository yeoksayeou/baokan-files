Women of Sanwang Village Exert Their Strength
　　Actively Participate in Party Rectification and Filling

[Our News] Women of Sanwang Village have played a role equal to that of men in this Party rectification and replenishment. Out of a total of 361 women in the village, excluding young girls and the elderly, 156 are involved, including 26 poor peasant women and 130 middle peasant women. During the disasters of 1942 and 1943, they began to organize, weaving and spinning to survive the famine and support their families. As a result, no one starved to death in Sanwang Village during the famine years. With women having an economic standing, relations between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law and between husbands and wives were also harmonious. However, due to the undemocratic nature of the village cadres, women, like men, were deprived of democratic freedom. Based on this situation, the work team simultaneously visited and mobilized women during the visits to the poor peasants and hired laborers, finding poor women like Liu Dide, Zhang Xiangde, and Li Mangde, and then had them connect with more than 20 others. Combining this with the publicity and education of the Outline Land Law, they were supported, and they gradually transitioned from talking about the pain of their lives to exposing the undemocratic behavior of the village cadres. During this mobilization process, some women were held back by emotions and fear of retaliation, not daring to speak out about their suffering. After repeated publicity of the Outline Land Law and influenced by the bold opinions of the male poor peasants and hired laborers, women's speeches outnumbered men's speeches by a factor of two at the second Party rectification conference. Wang Yugui's mother said that her child was labeled a spy by the cadres and hung up and beaten. After her child couldn't take it anymore, he ran away. The old woman didn't know her child had run away and still went to deliver food to her child, so the cadres said she let him go and beat the old woman, breaking one of her arms. She said: You have hurt me so badly, making my wife disabled, and unable to weave or spin to this day. As she spoke, she burst into tears. A total of 25 women in the village were hung up and beaten by the cadres, and 20 to 30 were detained, most of them because their husbands were falsely accused of being spies and their wives were beaten, some because of marriage problems, and some because of their children's problems. The women not only actively expressed their opinions at the conference but also grasped the principle of speaking practically. If anyone made incorrect comments about the cadres, they would also conduct appropriate criticism after the meeting. For example, Wang Chengde said, "That group of Party members is just no good." Bao Di opposed this, saying that there are good and bad Party members and you can't generalize. Some people also said, "There are no good people in the Party, good people are not in the Party," but Liu Dide opposed, saying, "The Communist Party is good, it's just this person who is bad, don't tar everyone with the same brush."

When the women's poor peasant and hired laborer group established the farmers' association, they actively developed farmers' association members. After two days of connecting, they developed 188 women members. Wang Huaiguo's mother, 65 years old, and Wang Changsheng's mother and Zeng Wang's mother, both over 60, had never gone out before, but this time they were also swept into the movement and automatically signed up to join the farmers' association. The total number of women participating in the farmers' association exceeded the total number of men by 57, freely forming six major groups. When electing farmers' association committee members and discussing candidates, they were serious and earnest, and the debates were very heated. For example, when someone proposed Li Shoushan, everyone said yes after deliberation, saying he spoke straightforwardly, with a direct heart and eyes, and didn't beat around the bush at all. He had good prestige and had been working for many years. Then they proposed San Mao, saying: "This person is muddled and wrong, not okay. In the past, when he was an appraiser, he exchanged the fruits, and his heart and eyes were not fair." Then they discussed the women candidates. When someone proposed Xing Baotang's wife, everyone immediately said: "She always liked to oppress people when she was a group leader in the past, not okay!" When Zhang Latang was proposed, they all said it was okay, she had a good temper, could lead people, and was a poor peasant and hired laborer. In proposing candidates, the women also grasped the standards they had discussed themselves – speaking straightforwardly, with a direct heart and eyes, good prestige, handling affairs fairly and actively, and working for many years. As a result, six women, including Zhang Latang, were elected out of the 17 committee members.

During the replenishment process, the women proposed not to touch the bottom line of the whole village, demanding to discuss it together with the men. The leadership immediately accepted the women's opinions, allowing women to participate in their men's groups during the discussion process. The poor peasant and hired laborer women's group was also incorporated into the men's poor peasant and hired laborer group. When they began to compare the "big hole" households, there was endless debate in the poor peasant and hired laborer group. Liu Dide (female) proposed, "First, let's find a big 'hole' household in our group to use as a leader, like herding sheep, find the lead sheep, and those who are the same as him will follow, and then find the second and third class 'hole' household leaders." Her idea solved everyone's dispute, and four standards were selected, and more than 40 poor peasants and hired laborers stood in whichever standard they fit. Everyone said: "This is clear! It's clear who has a big 'hole' and who has a small 'hole'."

After more than 20 days of democratic Party rectification and democratic replenishment, the women, like the men, took off their spy hats, released the grievances hidden in their hearts for several years, and truly enjoyed democratic rights. Now the village's women's weaving mutual aid groups, under the leadership of the newly elected six committee members, have been rectified, and a small weaving factory has also been established. During the spring plowing, they are preparing to actively help the men go to the fields to produce.

　　三王村妇女发挥力量
  　积极参加整党填补
    【本报消息】三王村妇女，在这次整党抽补中，发挥了与男人同等的作用。全村共有妇女三百六十一人，除小女和年老的外，共有一百五十六人，包括贫农妇女廿六人，中农妇女一百卅人。四二、四三灾荒年中，她们就开始组织起来，纺织渡荒，养活全家。因此，在灾荒年中，三王村没有饿死一个人。妇女在经济上有了地位，婆媳关系、夫妻关系也都和睦了。但由于村干不民主，妇女和男人一样的被剥夺了民主自由。工作组根据这种情况，在访贫雇中，就同时访问发动妇女，找到了贫苦妇女刘弟得、张香得、李忙得等，又由她们串连了廿余人，结合土地法大纲的宣传教育，给她们撑腰作主，她们逐渐由诉说生活的痛苦而转到揭发村干的不民主。在这一段发动过程中，还有少部分妇女碍情面，怕报复，不敢把自己的苦说出来。经过反复的宣传土地法大纲，和男贫雇大胆提意见的影响下，当第二次整党大会上，妇女发言超过男人发言的一倍。王玉癸的娘，说到她孩子被干部戴上特务帽子，吊打的她孩子吃不住劲后跑了，老太婆不知孩子跑了，仍然去给孩子送饭，干部就说是她放跑的，把老太婆吊打了一顿，一个胳膊已被吊断。她说：你们害得我好苦，使我老婆成了残废，到如今不能织纺了。说着已哭不成声。全村共计被干部吊打的妇女，有二十五人之多，被扣者有二三十，绝大部分因男人是被诬为特务，老婆被打，一部分是婚姻问题，一部分是孩子问题。大会上妇女提意见不但积极，同时也掌握了讲实际的原则，谁给干部提意见不正确，会后她们也进行适当的批判。如王成得提出“那伙党员就是不好”。暴弟就反对，提出党员也有好有坏，不能笼统。也有人提出：“在党没好人，好人不在党”，刘弟得就反对说：“共产党是好的，就是这个人坏了，不要一竿子撑一船人。”
    妇女贫雇小组在成立农会时，积极发展农会会员，经过两天的串连，发展了妇女会员一百八十八人。王怀国娘六十五岁，王长生娘、增望娘都是六十以上，她们从不出门，这次也被卷入运动，自动报名参加了农会。妇女参加农会总人数，超过男人总人数五十七人，自由结合成六大组。进行选举农会委员，讨论候选人时，她们郑重认真，争论非常热烈。如有人提出李守善，大家经过酝酿都说照，他说话不起态度，心肝眼儿直，一点不圪流拐弯。好威信，还是长年劳动。又提出三毛，说：“这人迷迷错错，不照。过去他当评议员时，把果实都换了，心肝眼儿不和平。”接着讨论妇女中的候选人，有人提出邢保堂老婆，大家马上就说：“她过去当组长总好压人，不照！”提出张拉堂，都说可以，好脾气，能领导人，又是贫雇。在提候选人中，妇女也掌握了她们自己讨论出的标准——不起态度，心肝眼儿直，好威信，办事公道积极，长年劳动。结果十七个委员中，有张拉堂等六个妇女当选。
    进行抽补中，妇女提出不摸全村的底儿，要求和男人在一起讨论。领导上马上接受了妇女的意见，在讨论过程中，让妇女参加到自己男人组内。贫雇妇女组，也编到男人贫雇组中。开始进行比窟窿户时，贫雇组里大家争论不休，刘弟得（女）就提出“先在咱这组找出一个大窟窿户以他作个头，象放羊的一样，找出羊头，和他一样的，就跟着走，再找二等三等窟窿户的头。”她这个意见，解决了大家的争论，选出了四个标准，四十几个贫雇都按自己合哪个标准就站在哪个标准中。大家都说：“这可亮了！谁窟窿大谁窟窿小这还不清楚。”
    经过二十多天的民主整党及民主填补，妇女和男人一样脱掉了特务帽子，出了隐藏在心里好几年的冤气，真正的享受了民主权利。现全村的妇女纺织互助组，在新选的六个委员领导下，都已整顿好，还成立了一个小型纺织工厂。春耕中，并准备积极帮助男人上地生产。
