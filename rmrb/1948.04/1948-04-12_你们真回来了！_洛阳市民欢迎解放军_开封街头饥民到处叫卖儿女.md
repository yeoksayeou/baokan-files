Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 10th -- When the People's Liberation Army re-captured Luoyang and entered the city on the 5th at noon, the masses welcomed them enthusiastically. Their first words were: "You're really back!" During the half-month that the Chiang bandit troops occupied Luoyang, the citizens of Luoyang suffered countless more disasters and hatred. The Chiang bandits robbed and extorted everywhere, arbitrarily arrested residents, and forced citizens to hand over relief supplies distributed by the People's Liberation Army. From the day the bandit troops entered the city, prices soared. A shi dou (fourteen jin) of millet rose from 300,000 Chiang currency to 500,000 yuan. Due to the robbery and extortion, shops and stalls were closed and business was suspended. Now the market is gradually becoming active again, snack vendors have reappeared on the streets selling their goods, and various businesses have successively reopened. Everywhere in the streets and alleys, groups of citizens can be seen listening to the soldiers explaining the current situation to them.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th -- Tianjin newspaper reports: Chiang bandits have recently been buying military grain at low prices in Kaifeng, causing severe suffering to the citizens. Before the 4th of last month, each shi dou of wheat was worth 140,000 Chiang currency, but the Chiang bandits forcibly purchased it everywhere at an "official price" of 90,000 yuan per dou, causing the price of wheat to skyrocket. By the 11th, each dou had risen to 400,000 yuan, but the Chiang bandits were still extorting at the original price. Due to the shortage of wheat, two flour mills have already closed, and even the coarsest native flour has risen to 51,000 yuan per jin. Citizens are flocking to fill their stomachs with peanut cakes that have already had the oil pressed out. Zhou Hengbao, a mechanic on the Longhai Railway, was driven to hang himself by the pressure of life; the number of people selling their children is increasing daily. Ma Jin'an of Muchang Street and famine victims in Caochang Street, Xiangguo Temple, Zhongzheng Road, and other city streets are selling their children everywhere, some even willing to give them away for free, to spare their children from starvation.

　　“你们真回来了！”
  　洛阳市民欢迎解放军
  　开封街头饥民到处叫卖儿女
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十日电】再度克复洛阳的解放军，五日中午进入洛阳市内时，群众群相欢迎，他们第一句话就是：“你们真回来了！”蒋匪军占据洛阳的半个月期间，洛阳市民又添多了无数灾难和仇恨，蒋匪到处抢劫勒索，滥捕居民，强迫市民交出解放军发放的救济物资。从匪军入城的当日起，物价就狂涨，一市斗（十四斤）小米由三十万蒋币涨到五十万元。因抢劫勒索，商店摊贩都关门停业。现市面已渐形活跃，零食摊贩又出现街头叫卖，各业相继开门营业。街头巷尾随时可见群集的市民倾听着战士们向他们讲解时事。
    【新华社陕北十日电】津报消息：蒋匪近在开封贱价抢购军粮，市民灾难深重。上月四日以前小麦每市斗值蒋币十四万元，而蒋匪以每斗九万元之“官价”到处勒购，麦价遂暴涨，至十一日每斗已涨达四十万元，但蒋匪仍用原价搜刮。由于小麦缺乏，两家面粉厂业已停闭，最粗劣的土面每斤也涨达五万一千元。市民纷纷以榨过油的花生饼充饥。陇海路机工周恒宝被生活逼得上吊；卖儿鬻女者日多，木厂街的马金安及草厂街、相国寺、中正路等市街的饥民到处叫卖儿女，甚至有情愿白送别人，使儿女免于饥饿者。
