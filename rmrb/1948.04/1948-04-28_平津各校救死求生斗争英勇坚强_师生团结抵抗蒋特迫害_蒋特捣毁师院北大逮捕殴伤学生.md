Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th – According to delayed news from Tianjin: Since the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government used special agent terror tactics to successively create atrocities in Pingjin schools, teachers and students have united as one, taking various effective self-defense measures to resolutely resist persecution by the Chiang bandits. On the 9th, when schools in Peiping held a large anti-oppression demonstration, representatives from Nankai and Beiyang Universities in Tianjin, as well as representatives from Peiping schools, participated in the demonstration's presidium. They unanimously demanded the immediate release of arrested students from the Teachers' College, compensation for losses, punishment of the murderers, cessation of summons (for students the Chiang bandits planned to arrest) of twelve students from Peking University, the immediate release of the two Chaoyang students arrested in Nanjing and all students arrested by the Chiang government, the withdrawal of the order dissolving the Student Union, increased educational funding, and guaranteed living conditions for teachers and staff. During the demonstration, all professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and staff of the Teachers' College, as well as dozens of professors and staff from Tsinghua, Peking University, and other schools, acted in concert with the students, going to Chiang bandit's headquarters to petition. After the demonstration, student unions from eleven institutions, including Nankai, Beiyang, Hebei Institute of Technology, Tangshan Institute of Technology, Peking University, Tsinghua, and Yenching in Tianjin and Peiping, held a joint meeting on the 10th, deciding that the 11th would be a general strike day to protest the atrocities of the Chiang special agents.

After the Chiang special agents destroyed Peking University on the 11th, all schools in Peiping increased vigilance, intensified strict self-defense work on campus, with worker-police and students jointly taking night watch, strictly preventing bad elements from infiltrating. More than two hundred worker-police at the Teachers' College demonstrated great patriotic and democratic enthusiasm, and have decided to organize a "Protection Corps" to protect the safety of students, and donated more than three million yuan to comfort the injured students. Representatives from the Peking University Professors' Association, Lecturers' and Assistants' Association, Staff Association, Student Union, and Worker-Police Association held a joint meeting on the morning of the 12th, first resolving to establish a Teacher-Student-Staff Safety Guarantee Committee as the leading organization for defending against persecution by special agent bandits. Similar organizations have been established successively in various schools. Teachers and students at Peking University have also taken resolute steps to refuse the Chiang bandits' arrest and interrogation of the twelve students they planned to arrest. The Chiang bandit Peiping District Court originally planned to open a preliminary hearing on the 10th, but the school's teachers and students jointly submitted a memorandum to the court, stating that the students could not appear in court, and declaring that if students were summoned to court, the entire Peking University would go to trial together. As a result, although the summons arrived at Peking University on the 10th, the twelve students did not appear in court.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th – According to delayed Tianjin newspapers, details of the Teachers' College special agent atrocities case reveal: At half past twelve on the night of the 8th, while the school's students were all asleep, sudden gunfire erupted. Fifty or sixty Chiang bandit special agents, disguised with headscarves and white cloths wrapped around their arms, holding short guns, wooden clubs, iron rods, and other weapons, jumped over the wall and rushed straight to the South Dormitory, brutally beating eight students, including Wang Gongyu, and dragging them away naked before they could put on clothes, with blood spilled on the streets all the way to Hepingmen. In addition, they wounded students Xie Chengxian (previously mistakenly reported as Huang Chengxian) and Jing Youxin, their skulls fractured, lying unconscious in pools of blood. After the eight arrested students were taken out of the school gate, they were blindfolded with cloth by the bandits, and placed on trucks at Hepingmen, driven to a special agent agency near Dongsi Shiyitiao, and beaten again, suffering many serious injuries, including one student's hand bone shattered, one person's ear beaten off, and another person's scalp split open. It was not until late on the 9th, under the pressure of large demonstrations by students from various schools, that Chiang bandit's headquarters were forced to release the eight arrested students. In this special agent atrocity, the Teachers' College Student Union Council office, the Historical Society, and the Geographical Society weather station were all destroyed by the bandits. The bandits also robbed three radios, three phonographs, more than one hundred records, more than three million yuan in cash from the canteen committee, and many personal belongings of Wang Gongyu, such as clothes, books, and a violin. The total loss of the college reached a huge amount of one hundred billion yuan. On the evening of the 11th, more than forty Chiang special agent bandits broke into the Teachers' College, tore up slogans and wall newspapers on the wall, and smashed bulletin boards. One female student was brutally beaten by the bandits.

Another report: At 2:00 p.m. on the 11th of this month, dozens of Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents suddenly attacked the East Dormitory of Peking University professors. The lights and telephones in half of the houses were all smashed, and even the toilets were not spared. A total of eleven houses were destroyed, with the homes of Wu Enyu and Zhao Silu suffering the most damage. More than two hundred pieces of glass were broken in Honglou and East Dormitory, scattered all over the ground. Many students, including He Tengtian, Zhang Yi, Dai Qianliao, Li Yunhong, and Di Zhucang, were arrested by the bandits.
