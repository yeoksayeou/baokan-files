[Shouyang News] The Zhang Hanhe Village in the Fourth District of this county initially started with democratic work on re-distribution. After in-depth investigation, the current demands of the masses were to speed up preparations for spring ploughing to overcome the famine. Based on the county's work instructions, the work group boldly changed its re-distribution policy and turned to accelerating preparations for spring ploughing and disaster relief, combined with armed defense of spring ploughing, as the primary focus. However, in the implementation, some poor peasants and hired laborers, who had not completely turned themselves around, such as the old man Cui Wancheng and Guo Jiayin, wanted to raise seeds but had no land. They requested the work group to resolve this at the meeting. At this time, the leaders readily agreed that the difficulties of the masses must be resolved. At the same time, the work group cadres convened meetings of poor peasant groups and found that some poor peasants and hired laborers did have difficulties and needed to temporarily borrow the village's temple land, communal land, and undistributed fruit land for cultivation, only paying the burden and not the rent, in order to meet the needs of landless and land-poor peasants. However, some new middle peasants, such as Guo Tonggui, returned bad land and demanded to cultivate good land. Under this endless and excessively high demand, there was no surplus land, and it was bound to involve cadres taking over land and some land from the middle peasants. The poor peasant group discussed dividing Guo Yinxiao's over-occupied land equally. Under this disguised re-distribution, cadres, middle peasants, and rich peasants became fearful and offered land one after another. For example, the village chief Guo Genle offered four mu of land, four middle peasant families also offered land, and the rich peasant Guo Rou'er's mother also pushed out land, causing extreme confusion in the village's spring ploughing mood. Because the poor peasants and new middle peasants could not satisfy their excessively high demands, they were discouraged and dissatisfied and not actively engaged in production. The rich peasants, middle peasants, and cadres were afraid of delivering manure to the land, hitting clods, and having their land taken away, suffering losses. In short, the middle peasants and cadres lay down and did nothing, watching and waiting, and the spring ploughing mood was quite low. At this time, the comrades of the work group wavered in implementing the central group's policy, using the re-distribution ideology to solve the difficulties in spring ploughing, distorting the spirit of the policy, and not fully recognizing that the motives of the poor peasants' demands for solving difficulties were impure. They failed to give timely and forceful prevention and education, resulting in disguised re-distribution and creating obstacles to spring ploughing. After discovering this problem, Comrade Li Guicheng of the sub-district military committee went to the village to conduct ideological investigations of various classes and carried out ideological mobilization targeting the ideology, explaining that it was inappropriate to move the land of middle peasants and cadres, and made corrections. In particular, he explained the importance of speeding up preparations for spring ploughing to overcome the famine. After such ideological mobilization, the production enthusiasm of the poor and middle peasants was stimulated. For example, some people said: "What they said coincides with our thoughts." The mood was stabilized, and production was promoted. Because the village had formed a state of no leadership, the old cadres did not work, and the poor peasant groups worked haphazardly. For example, the poor peasant groups held meetings constantly, causing the old cadres and middle peasants to suspect. In addition, the volunteer teacher Guo Xiucai misinterpreted that the poor peasant groups could do whatever they wanted, which made the old cadres and middle peasants even more panicked, thinking that good composition meant power. Therefore, the old cadres adopted an attitude of resisting and lying down towards the poor peasant groups, while the poor peasant groups universally despised and excluded the old cadres, not getting along, let alone leading together. The leadership grasped this situation and decided to re-establish the village-level leadership organization. The method was to select honest peasants from the poor peasant groups who were engaged in labor all year round, were upright, supported by the middle peasants, and had some working ability, such as designating Huo Suoxiao as the temporary deputy village chief, Guo Zhengdao as the temporary chairman of the peasant association, Guo Ermao as the temporary vice chairman, Guo Sankou as the temporary director of the cooperative, and Guo Ailian as the temporary women's minister (responsible for leading and organizing the 100-day textile movement). The original positions of the military committee director, village chief, and militia instructor remained unchanged (if they were better). The bad cadres Wen Xueyi (chairman of the peasant association), who were guilty of corruption, occupying too much land, and adopting Kuomintang style, lay down and did not work and even undermined the land law to threaten the masses, and Guo Xiucai (volunteer teacher), who provoked marriages and committed adultery with women, were opposed by the masses and were dismissed, asked to reflect, and warned to engage in honest labor. After such rectification and improvement of the village-level leadership organization, with the village-level core cadres forming the spring ploughing disaster relief committee, the gaps between the middle and poor peasants were eliminated, and the production enthusiasm of cadres and masses rose. Everyone said: This is the way to do it well.

　　张韩河工作团做了群众尾巴
  　变相抽补影响春耕
    【寿阳消息】本县四区张韩河村起初是从抽补民主工作入手的，深入调查后，群众当前要求，在于加紧准备春耕渡荒。工作组根据县里工作指示大胆改变抽补方针，转向加紧准备春耕救灾，结合武装保卫春耕，为第一方针。但在执行中，有部分贫雇，未翻透身，如崔万成老汉和郭甲银等，想养种而无土地，即在会议上要求工作团结以解决，这时领导上圆满答应群众有困难者一定予以解决。同时工作团干部召开贫农小组会议，发现有些贫雇确有困难，须拿村中的庙地、社地及未分配出的果实地，暂借给他们耕种，只出负担不出租子，以满足无地少地农民要求。但是有些新中农，如郭同贵等将坏地退出，要求种好地。在这种无止境过高的要求下，没有多余土地，势必要动干部多占和中农一部土地，贫雇组就将郭银小多占土地讨论均分。这样变相的抽补影响下，引起了干部、中农和富农害怕，纷纷往出献地。例如村长郭根乐献出四亩地，四家中农也往出献地，富农郭肉儿母也往出推地，引起村中春耕情绪极端混乱；而贫雇和新中农因满足不了过高的要求，也泄气不满，不积极生产；富农中农干部怕送上粪耙了地，打了圪垃，人家抽走自己吃亏，总之中农干部躺倒不干，观望等待，春耕情绪颇为低落。这时工作团同志在执行中心组方针上，产生动摇，以抽补思想，来解决春耕当中的困难，歪曲了方针的精神，没有足够认识到贫雇要求解决困难的动机不纯，给以及时有力的阻止，进行教育，打通思想，结果形成了变相抽补，造成了春耕的障碍。发现这一问题后，即由分区武委会李贵成同志前去该村进行了各阶层的思想调查，针对思想进行了思想发动，说明动中农和干部多占是不妥当的，并做了纠正；特别说明加紧准备春耕渡过灾荒的重要性。经这样思想发动后，启发了贫中农的生产劲头，如有些人说：“人家说的和咱心思碰头”。安定了情绪，推动了生产。因该村已形成无领导状态，旧干部不干，贫农小组乱干，如贫农小组不断开会，引起旧干部和中农的怀疑，又加上义务教员郭秀才曲解贫农小组想怎干就怎干，这样更使得旧干部和中农异常恐慌，认为成份好就厉害，所以旧干部对贫农组是招架躺倒不干的态度，而贫农组对旧干部，一律轻视排斥，互相尿不在一个夜壶里，更谈不到共同领导。领导上摸住了这个情况，决定重新健全村级领导机构，方法是选择贫雇组中的老实农民，常年劳动，为人正派，中农拥护而又有点工作能力的，如霍锁小指定暂代副村长，郭正道指定暂代农会主席，郭二毛暂代副主席，郭三扣暂代合作社长，郭爱莲暂代妇女部长（负责领导组织百日纺织运动），武委会主任、村长、民兵指导员原职不动（较好的），坏干部温学义（农会主席）贪污多占，国民党作风，躺倒不干反而破坏土地法威胁群众，郭秀才（义教）挑拨婚姻，奸淫妇女，群众反对即撤职，让其反省，警告其老实劳动。经过这样整顿健全村级领导机构，以村级核心干部组成春耕救灾委员会，消除了中贫农中之隔阂，干部群众生产情绪即形高涨，大家说：这样就干好了。
