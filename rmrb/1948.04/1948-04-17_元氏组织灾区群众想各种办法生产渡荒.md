(Yuanshi News) The severe famine in the new district of Yuanshi has caused unrest, which has drawn the attention of the leadership. County Secretary Zhi Shichang pointed out that if we do not pay attention to leading production and disaster relief, it will inevitably lead to serious crimes. Necessary measures have been taken at the county leadership level to organize the masses to engage in production to overcome the famine. The seriously affected Sixth District has been allocated loans of 20 million yuan, 65,000 catties of grain, 80,000 catties of bran, and 30,000 catties of vegetables. The loans are mainly used to support textiles, small vendors, and livestock purchases, while the grain, bran, and vegetables are mainly used to aid the poor, widowed, and those without labor. Secondly, the fruits of struggle stored in various villages are also organized for distribution, and these grains and funds are invested in disaster relief, which can solve significant difficulties in life and production. Furthermore, the transportation of 250,000 catties of grain has been organized, which can earn a profit of more than 10 million yuan, also solving the livelihood problems of many people. In Nansu, one household earns more than 20,000 yuan in silver by pushing a round-trip cart. Fifty looms and five hundred spinning wheels in Nansu have been planned, and they can earn at least 100,000 yuan in silver every day, enough to buy six small stones of grain. In Xizheng, an oil mill alone has solved the problems of many refugees through sesame seeds. However, the most common production avenue in various villages is textiles. Each household in each village has an average of one spinning wheel, and approximately six or seven households share one loom. Now, in addition to solving the sales of homespun cloth and providing loans for purchasing raw materials, efforts are being made to organize production. In agricultural production, various villages are determining land use rights. Land that has been confiscated is distributed to landless and land-poor peasants for cultivation. Landlords and rich peasants who have been struggled against and have no land are allocated a portion of land from the fruits of the struggle for cultivation. Prosperous middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against have their land returned to them. Landlords and rich peasants whose land has not been struggled against or confiscated are allowed to hand over a portion of their land to landless and land-poor peasants for cultivation because they lack labor and livestock to cultivate it themselves. Currently, the main focus is on determining usage rights (because it has not been equally divided). Some villages have already completed the distribution, while others are still in the process of distribution. To solve the difficulty of lacking labor for cultivation, some villages have organized people to help with livestock, with people acting as livestock and people pulling plows. For example, Zhang Lanhe's family in Dakong has nine people and cultivates more than ten mu of their own land, rents nine mu, and has been allocated another eight or nine mu this year. Five brothers work together to pull the plow, with one person holding the plow and four people pulling it, allowing them to cultivate more than three mu a day.

Several issues in leading production to overcome the famine: First, we must pay attention to overcoming the tendency and actions of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants. For example, in Fucun, poor peasants and hired laborers lack about seven qing of land, and they only struggled for three qing from landlords and rich peasants last year, so they want to find ways to get land from middle peasants. Some villages, such as Fucun and Duzhuang, are now demanding to borrow grain from and struggle against middle peasants. We have resolutely educated them and stopped them. (Note: In this situation, special attention must be paid to mastering the policy towards middle peasants, and we must not commit tailism.) In addition, it is certain that we must take care of and unite with middle peasants when distributing land, but the leadership must recognize that the poor and hired labor class in these areas is particularly large, and many have not fundamentally turned over. Therefore, satisfying the demands of the poor and hired laborers first is still fundamental, and we must pay attention to overcoming the egalitarian viewpoints of the peasants. Secondly, we must pay attention to mastering the resolution of sectarian struggles in various villages. The poorer and more difficult the situation, the more intense the contradictions. One village says that another village has a solution, and another village says that this village is doing better. Therefore, everyone feels that the grain and funds they receive are too little. For example, Song Cao East Street has contradictions with West Street and North Street. The poor peasant committee of East Street scrubbed away all but five or six households in North Street who received disaster relief grain, causing dissatisfaction in North Street and leading to disputes. The eastern and western halves of Nansu have contradictions and have quarreled over transportation. These contradictions are most likely to arise and develop, especially in the distribution of disaster relief grain and funds and the determination of land rights. Thirdly, in this work, we must follow the mass line and let the masses discuss, and we must oppose administrative orders and paternalism. However, the main problem at present is tailism, following the masses blindly, such as egalitarian viewpoints in disaster relief, infringement of the interests of middle peasants, and failure to provide relief or distribute land to poor, absent, and fleeing households. All of these issues must be effectively persuaded and educated.

Furthermore, in organizing disaster relief and overcoming the famine, it is very important to call on cadres to share weal and woe with the disaster victims. Disciplinary measures must be emphasized for some cadres who cannot share weal and woe with the disaster victims, and they cannot be allowed to develop unchecked. For example, when organizing transportation, some cadres (such as Zhao Futai) feigned illness and did not lead the masses, causing great suffering to the disaster victims, and they must be severely criticized.

　　元氏组织灾区群众
  　想各种办法生产渡荒
    【元氏消息】元氏新区由于严重的灾荒，造成不安现象，已引起领导上的注意，县书智世昌指出如再不注意领导生产救灾，必将造成严重罪恶。并在县领导上进行了必要的措施，决以全力组织群众生产渡荒，灾荒严重的六区已拨发贷款二千万元，贷粮六万五千斤，糠八万斤，菜三万斤。贷款主要扶植纺织、小商贩及买牲口，贷粮糠菜主要救济贫苦及孤寡无劳力者。其次各村存放的斗争果实也组织分配，用这些粮款投入救灾，可解决生活和生产上的很大困难。又组织二十五万斤粮食的运输，共可赚利一千余万，也解决了好多人的生活问题。南苏一户推来回脚，二个人赚洋二万余元。南苏五十个布机、五百辆纺车，已作了计划，每天最少可赚洋十万元，买六小石谷子。西正一个油坊，单麻糁解决了不少难民问题。但各村最普遍的生产门路是纺织，各村每户能平均一个纺车，大约六七家一个织布机。现在除解决了土布的销路和贷款买原料外，正在用力组织。在农业生产上各村已正在确定土地的使用权，已没收者分给无地少地农民耕种，地主富农被斗无土地者，从果实地中筹划出一部分给他们耕种，斗错的富裕中农原地退回；未斗争未没收的地主富农土地，由于没劳力没牲口耕种不了，可拿出一部分，交给无地少地农民耕种。这些地当前主要是确定使用权（因没经过平分）。现有的村已分配好，有的村正在分配。在解决耕地劳力缺乏困难上，有的村组织人帮牲口，人代牲口，人拉犁。如大孔张兰和家九口人自己耕地十余亩，租入九亩，今年又分到八、九亩，弟兄五人伙拉犁，一人扶犁四个人拉，一天可耕三亩多。
    在领导生产渡荒中的几个问题：首先注意克服侵犯中农利益的倾向和行动，如富村贫雇缺地约七顷，去年从地主富农手中斗争出仅三顷，他们就想从中农身上想法。富村、杜庄等村，有的现在要求借粮、斗中农。我们都坚决的教育停止了。（按：在这种情况下，特别要注意掌握对中农政策，不要犯尾巴主义错误。）另外分配土地时，照顾和团结中农是肯定的，但在领导上必须认识这些地区贫雇阶层特大，不少根本没有翻了身，因此首先满足贫雇要求，还是基本的，必须注意克服农民的平均主义观点。其次注意掌握解决各村的宗派斗争，越穷越困难矛盾越厉害，这个村说那个村有法，那个村说这个村好过，因此在发粮款上都嫌少，如宋曹东街与西街北街有矛盾，东街贫农委员把北街领救济粮的户洗刷的剩下五六户，北街不满意，因此发生争执。南苏东半部与西半部闹矛盾，曾因运输发生争吵。特别是在分配救济粮款和确定地权上，最容易产生和发展这些矛盾。再次，在这一工作上，必须走群众路线让群众讨论，反对行政命令包办代替，但当前主要问题是尾巴主义，跟着群众跑，如救济中的平均主义观点，侵犯中农利益，贫苦伪属逃亡户不救济不分地等，都须很好的说服教育。
    再在组织救灾渡荒上，号召干部与灾民同甘苦很重要，对一些不能和灾民同甘苦的干部，要强调纪律，不能任其发展。如组织运输，有的干部（如赵福太）装病不带领群众去，使灾民受罪很大，须要严格批评。
