　　Heshun Dongguan Fully Promotes Democracy
  　Cadres and Party Members Return Fruits
    Dongguan Working Group Research, Liu Feng and Zhiyuan (organizers)
    After the village government committee election in Heshun Dongguan on April 7th, discussions began in the afternoon regarding specific content for compensation and replenishment. In addition to land measurement and yield assessment, the main issue to be resolved was the excessive share of fruits taken by cadres and party members. On the 8th, a poor peasant and farm laborer group meeting was held, where the above work was unanimously demanded. In the afternoon, the peasant representative meeting conducted specific research and made a resolution. On the afternoon of the 9th, the peasant representative meeting convened a meeting of cadres and party members, adopting a method of self-reporting and public discussion to research each case individually. On the 10th, the entire membership passed the resolution, with the process lasting three days. A total of 18 cadres and party members had taken excessive shares of fruits, consisting of five workers, six poor peasants, four poor people, and three middle peasants. They returned seven mu of hemp fields, an average of twenty-seven mu of land, and four mu of sloping land, amounting to a total yield of sixty-nine shi, three dou, and one sheng. The value of the fruits was 240,000 yuan. The process unfolded as follows:

    I. Everyone discusses the approach: During a poor peasant league meeting to discuss how to return the fruits, the masses offered their opinions, which were quite inconsistent. Mao Fubao said, "I say that cadres and party members should return all the fruits they took, and they have to display everything they gained piece by piece, so we can divide it up first, and then let them get some, so they can suffer a bit, otherwise they won't know our suffering!" Immediately after Fubao finished speaking, a commotion erupted. Cai Sanhai, over fifty years old, interjected, "I say Mao Fubao's opinion is wrong. Cadres and party members should return the excessively divided fruits, but they used to be the same as us. If they take everything out, won't they become paupers again? The Land Law Outline says to return the excess portion, not to take everything." The working group asked everyone, "Is Mao Fubao's opinion right, or Cai Laosan's?" They said in unison that Lao San's opinion was right. Li Gongcheng said, "When party members return, let them do it voluntarily, then we will discuss it and everyone will agree. Finally, the leadership should synthesize everyone's opinions and clearly point out: Party member cadres who have taken excessive fruits must return them. The voluntarily extracted amounts calculated during rent and interest reduction should be returned. Any embezzled or stolen goods must be returned in full. If already used, compensate at the current price."

    On the 9th, the peasant representative meeting preliminarily discussed and made resolutions on the land and floating wealth (converted to money) to be returned by each party member cadre. On the 10th, a meeting of peasant association members was convened, where party member cadres would self-report one by one for public discussion. The peasant representative meeting also presented its resolutions for everyone to discuss, making revisions as necessary. The first to self-report was construction committee member Wang Fulin, who voluntarily returned five and a half mu of land and 15,000 yuan of floating wealth. Everyone said he was returning too much, fearing he would become a pauper again, and only allowed him to return two and a half mu of land and 10,000 yuan. The second to self-report was former branch secretary Zhang Chengke. His family of four had a yield of more than 28 shi, and he voluntarily requested to return 12 shi, and also returned more than 50,000 yuan of first-class fruits he had received last year. He said, "I ate too much, while everyone else is still hungry. I am sorry to everyone." Everyone said that it was enough to know his mistake and correct it, and that he was returning too much money, only allowing him to return 30,000 yuan. The land returned matched his self-reported number and was completely consistent with the resolution of the peasant representative meeting. A relatively intense dispute arose when discussing former women's chairman Feng Linmei. Linmei's family currently has three people, with a yield of 19 shi, and received 42,000 yuan of fruits. She self-reported that she wanted to return 7.5 shi of yield and 30,000 yuan, while the peasant representative meeting's decision was to return 5 shi of yield, 10,000 yuan, and all the stolen fruits. Everyone's opinions were very inconsistent. Some said that the amount she self-reported was too high, and some said it was just right. Wang Fuyuan, however, believed it was too low. He said, "She got first-class fruits, with a yield of 6.3 shi per person, and has three-fourths of a livestock share. Compare her to me: my fruits are second-class, and my yield is not enough, and my family doesn't even have one-fourth of a share." Zhao Cheng said, "Our group and Wang Fuyuan's group have different opinions. We say Linmei is returning too much, it's not reasonable. It's true she occupied too many fruits, but if she is to return, she should return the same as Fuyuan, a second-class amount. People have three-fourths of a share and also pawned two-fourths, Wang Fuyuan, didn't you divide a fourth? Now you don't even have half a share, is she right or are you right? Are you asking her to become a pauper and then fill her up again? Is what you are saying reasonable or not?" Everyone argued fiercely, but no conclusion could be reached. Later, the leadership helped everyone calculate the account. According to a second-class share, she should only return more than 4,000 yuan. The masses laughed and said, "Isn't that right? You can't just argue without calculating the account!" Everyone fully agreed with the peasant representative meeting's decision. The most intense debate occurred regarding the issue of party member Zheng Donglian returning fruits. Her yield was not high, and she received more fruit money, but her family had difficulties and could not return the money, so she wanted to return three dou of grain. The peasant representative meeting decided to take care of her difficulties and not make her return anything. Liu Chengchun expressed that his group did not agree with Donglian's self-report and the peasant representative meeting's decision: "Her family's foundation isn't bad, and she divided a lot of fruits, so why is she in difficulty?" There was anger in his words. Women's group member Li Guimei said, "Her family, one sister-in-law eats pancakes, and the other fried eggs, how much is enough to eat? They should return it." Dong Tonghai's group said, "The men in Donglian's family are not united, each taking care of their own interests, and not working hard, they should return it." Only Zhao Maonian and two other groups agreed with the peasant representative meeting's decision, saying that although it was true that her family did not work hard, they could be educated in the future. The leadership supported this opinion, pointing out that the root of her family's waste and lack of hard work was disharmony, and that her current difficulties should be taken care of and she should be educated to correct her behavior. Later, everyone argued for a long time and all agreed, but somewhat reluctantly. Finally, it was announced as a preliminary resolution, which could still be discussed later and revised if it was incorrect. When discussing the issue of peasant association vice chairman Du Zhangsuo, the focus of the dispute was on the hemp fields (good land). His family of three had a yield of 19 shi, an excess of 7 shi, but four and a third mu of this was hemp field, which was too much. However, this was land that each had calculated and returned during the previous rent and interest reduction period. His wife had nursed someone else's child for three or four years without spending any money, which saved them money. Zhangsuo himself said that he was only willing to return two mu of hemp field (4.8 shi of yield) and 30,000 yuan. The majority of the masses believed that he was returning too little and that the yield was still high and that he should return three mu. A minority of people believed that land that had been calculated and returned by oneself should be voluntary and not forced. The leadership expressed respect for the minority's opinion and allowed everyone to fully debate. In the end, the minority opinion turned into the majority opinion, and as a result, only two mu of land and 30,000 yuan were returned.

    In this fruit returning movement, democracy was generally promoted, and the right of speech and defense of the minority was seriously guaranteed, so that the issue could be fully discussed and correctly resolved. From this, it can be seen that as long as democracy is promoted and properly guided, the partial and extreme opinions among the masses (such as letting party member cadres return all the land and other fruits they have obtained) can be corrected among the masses, and the majority of party members and the masses can be satisfied. In addition, practical difficulties and special issues can also be reasonably taken care of, without becoming mechanically rigid. It should be believed that the masses are the most aware of the reality and the most able to proceed from the reality. This kind of democratic discussion also has a great effect on solving the relationship between party members and the masses and should not be regarded as a technical issue.

　　和顺东关充分发扬民主
  　干部党员退果实
    东关工作组研究  刘锋、志远整理
    和顺东关四月七日村政委员会选举后，下午就开始讨论抽补具体内容，除丈地评产量外，特别要解决干部党员多占果实问题。八日开贫雇小组会议，上述工作为贫雇小组一致要求，下午农代会进行具体研究作了决议。九日下午，农代会召开干部党员会议，采取自报公议方法，逐一研究。十日全体会员通过，共进行三天。多占果实的干部党员共十八个，成份为工人五、贫农六、贫民四、中农三，共退出麻地七亩、平均二十七亩、坡地四亩，共产量六十九石三斗一；果实款洋二十四万元，其进行情形如下。
    一、大家讨论做法：贫农团会上讨论怎样退果实时，群众你一言，他一语，意见很不一致。毛福保说：“我说干部和党员退果实得全退，还得把得了的东西一件一件摆出来，先尽咱们分了再给他得，叫他们也受受罪，不然他们还不知咱们的苦哩！”福保说完，紧接着一阵吵吵。五十多岁的蔡三孩抢着说：“我说毛福保意见不对，干部党员多分了果实得退出来，可是他们以前也和咱一样，如果都拿出来，他们不是又成了圪洞？土地法大纲上是退出多得部分，不是全拿”。工作组问大家，毛福保意见对，还是蔡老三意见对？不约而同的说老三意见对。李功成说：“党员们退时，让他们自愿，然后咱们讨论，大家同意。最后领导综合大家意见，明确指出：党员干部多占果实一律退出，减租减息时算下的自愿抽出，贪污的偷的全退，如已用，折价赔偿。
    九日，农代会初步讨论，对各个党员干部应退之土地与浮财（折钱）作出决议。十日召开农会会员大会，由党员干部一一自报，大家公议。农代会也将自己的决议提出，请大家讨论，必要时做修改，第一个自报的是建设委员王福林，他自愿退五亩半地、一万五千元浮财。大家都说他退得太多，怕又退成圪洞，只让退了二亩半地、一万元；第二个自报的是前支书张成科，他家四口人，有产量二十八石多，自请退出十二石，并退去年所分一等一级果实五万余元。他说：“我吃的太饱，大家还饿着，我对不起大家了。”大家说知错改错就行，钱退的太多，只让退三万元。退地照他自报数，与农代会决议完全一致。讨论前妇女主席冯林梅时，发生了比较激烈的争执。林梅家现有三口人，十九石产量，得果实四万二千元，她自报要退七石五产量，三万元钱，农代会的决定是退五石产量、一万元，偷的一些果实全退。大家意见很不一致，有的说她自报退数太高，有的说正好。王富元则认为还低，他说：“她得果实是一等一级，产量每人六石三，牲口有三条腿，就和我比吧：果实是一等二级，产量又不够，俺家没一条腿。”赵成来说：“俺这组和王富元组意见不一样。俺说林梅退的太多，不合情理。她占果实是多，可是要退也让和富元一样，一等二级。人家得了一条腿，又典了两条，王富元你没有分了一条腿？现在半条也没有，人家对还是你对？你叫她退成圪洞，再给她填？你说在理不在理？”大家争论很厉害，但得不出结论，后来领导上帮助大家算了个帐，按一等二级算才该退四千多元。群众哈哈大笑说：“这不对了吗？不算帐光死辩？”大家完全同意农代会决定。关于党员郑东连退果实的问题，争论最激烈，他产量不高，果实款分得多些，但家里困难，退钱退不出来，想退三斗粮食。农代会决定是照顾其困难，不退，刘成春表示他组不同意东连自报与农代会决议：“她家底子不孬，分果实也不少，为甚困难。”话里带着气愤，妇女组李桂梅说：“他家妯娌一个吃烙饼，一个炒鸡蛋，有多少够吃？应该退出来。”董同孩组说：“东连家男人们是皮毛不合股，各顾各，都不好好劳动，该退。”只有赵卯年等两个组同意农代会决定，说他家劳动不好虽是事实，但以后可以教育。领导上支持这意见，指出他家浪费与不好好劳动的根源是不和睦，应照顾其目前困难，教育其改正。后来大家争论很久，都同意了，但有些勉强，最后宣布作为初步决议，下去还可讨论，不对了再改。讨论农会副主席杜章锁问题时，争执的焦点是麻地（好地）。他家三口人，十九石产量，多七石，但其中有四亩三麻地，太多，但这是以前减租息时期各得各算回来的，他老婆给人家奶了三、四年孩子，一个钱不花省下的，章锁自己表示只愿意退二亩麻地（四石八产量），三万元钱，群众中多数认为退得少，产量仍高，应退三亩，少数人认为自己算回的地应该凭自愿，不能勉强，领导上表示尊重少数人意见，让大家充分争论，最后少数意见又转为多数，结果只退二亩地，三万元钱。
    在这次退果实运动中，一般是发扬了民主，并认真保障了少数人的发言权，申辩权，使问题得到充分讨论与正确解决。从这中间看，只要发扬民主，好好诱导，群众中部分的偏激意见（如让党员干部全部退出所得土地与其他果实）是可以在群众中得到纠正的，党员与群众之大多数是可以得到满意的。另外，实际的困难与特殊的问题也可以得到合理的照顾，不至成为机械的死搬。应该相信，群众是最了解实际，最能从实际出发的。这种民主的讨论，在解决党员与群众的关系问题上也有很大作用，不应认为技术问题。
