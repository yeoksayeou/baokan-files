Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 1st: Comprehensive reports from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas indicate that prices continued to soar in the first half of March, causing panic among the bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek. On the 11th, the bandit Chiang summoned Zhang Jia'ao, the president of his Central Bank, to discuss countermeasures, from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM, but no solution was found. The Chiang bandit's National Economic Commission also stated that the price surge across various regions was unstoppable. During this period, in addition to the price of US dollars in Shanghai rising to 440,000 Chiang currency and gold reaching 27 million, the Chiang bandit's central nest, Nanjing, experienced a chaotic market with prices but no sales on the 12th. The situation in Beiping on the 12th was "extremely bad" (according to the Tianjin Dagong Daily), with prices reaching unprecedented levels, flour exceeding 2 million per bag, meaning over 50,000 per jin. The scope of price increases was very broad, with not only daily necessities such as grain and cloth but also many foreign goods experiencing rapid increases. In Tianjin on the 9th, flour rose to 1.84 million per bag, an increase of 210,000 compared to February 29th. In Zhangjiakou on the 11th, gold ornaments jumped by 4 million per tael in one day, reaching 35 million, which was 8 million higher than in Shanghai at that time; Sunshine cloth jumped from 3.1 million to 3.3 million per bolt; grain prices also soared. On the same day, flour in Qingdao rose even more fiercely to 2.25 million, even higher than in Beiping. On the 12th, prices in Hankou almost doubled compared to the 10th, with 20-count Red Lion brand yarn jumping from 72 million to 112 million. Prices in Taiyuan were even more shocking, with sorghum flour and corn flour being priced at 70,000 per jin, and machine-made flour reaching 110,000 per jin, or 4.4 million per bag.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 30th: Tianjin News: By the end of March, when salaries were paid, the actual income of an ordinary civil servant in Pingjin with a base salary of 50 yuan had fallen to 9 yuan and 4 jiao, which was less than one-fifth of the pre-war level (less than 19 percent); however, before the Chiang bandit's salary adjustments based on the cost of living index, in December of last year, the actual income of a 50 yuan-level civil servant was still 18 yuan, equivalent to 36 percent of the pre-war level. After the index-based salary adjustments, the actual income of civil servants decreased by nearly half again. The sharp decline in the actual income of public sector employees in areas such as Nanjing and Shanghai was similar. After the Chiang bandit implemented the index-based salary adjustments in January of this year, the entire Chiang-controlled area was divided into five regions, and "representative indexes" were set, with the lowest being 52,000 times and the highest being 150,000 times. For example, the Chiang bandit's index for the Pingjin area was set at 105,000 times, but in December of last year, the actual cost of living index in Pingjin was at least 165,000 times, and the official index was only 70% of the actual. Since the beginning of this year, the monthly price increase rate has been at least one-third, so a civil servant with a base salary of 50 yuan had an actual income of only 16 yuan and 8 jiao at the end of January, which further decreased to 12 yuan and 6 jiao at the end of February, and further decreased to 9 yuan and 4 jiao at the end of March.

　　蒋区物价继续飞涨不可收拾
  　太原面粉每斤十一万
    公教人员实际薪金不足战前五分之一
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：三月上半月蒋区各地物价继续飞涨，使匪首蒋介石为之心惊胆战。十一日蒋贼召见其中央银行总裁张嘉＠商讨对策，自下午八时到深夜十一时，迄无办法。蒋匪全国经济委员会亦表示：各地涨风已不可收拾。此时期内各地的涨风，除十日上海美钞涨达蒋币四十四万，黄金二千七百万外，蒋匪的中心巢穴南京市场十二日陷入有价无市的混乱状态。北平十二日行情“至为恶劣”（津大公报语），物价之高达空前纪录，面粉每袋冲出二百万大关，即每斤卖到五万以上。且涨价的范围非常宽广，除日用必需的粮布等货外，许多洋货亦竞相上涨。天津九日面粉每袋即涨到一百八十四万，较二月二十九日涨了二十一万。张家口十一日一天内饰金每两跳跃四百万而达三千五百万，比上海当时还高八百万；阳光布由每匹三百一十万跳到三百三十万；粮价也随之飞涨。同日青岛面粉更涨到二百二十五万，涨得比北平还凶。汉口十二日的物价比十日几乎上涨半倍，二十支红狮球沙由七千二百万一下跳到一亿一千二百万。太原物价更为惊人，高粱面、玉米面每市斤有索价七万元者，机制面粉每斤更达十一万，每袋四百四十万。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】津讯：当三月底领薪时，平津一个五十元底薪的普通公务员实际收入已降到九元四角，即已不足战前的五分之一（为百分之十九弱）；但在蒋匪按生活指数发薪前，去年十二月五十元级的公务员的实际收入尚为十八元，即等于战前百分之三十六。按指数发薪后，公务员的实际收入又减低将近一倍。京、沪等区公教人员实际收入的锐减情形亦与此类似。按蒋匪今年一月实行按指数发薪后，将全蒋区分为五个区，定出“代表指数”，最低的为五万二千倍，最高的一十五万倍。例如平津区蒋匪指数定为十万五千倍，但去年十二月平津实际生活指数至少为十六万五千倍，官定指数等于打了七折，而今年以来物价每月上涨率至少为三分之一，因此一个五十元底薪的公务员，一月底领薪时，实际收入仅为十六元八角，二月底再降为十二元六角，到三月底更降为九元四角。
