　　To the Editor:
    On March 29th alone, four farmers came to the Changzhi Municipal Government requesting to settle down. Two were introduced by the Qinshui County Government, with official letters stating that the farmers wished to move to Changzhi City, so they were introduced; the other two were refugees introduced from Pingyao, also requesting to settle in Changzhi City. These farmers all wanted to settle in the city and wanted land to cultivate, which ultimately resulted in no way to accommodate them.
    I have the following opinions on the issue of immigration to cities:
    First: In cities, the main issue is not equal distribution, but the protection and development of industry and commerce. Most feudal elements have also been overthrown, so the desire to come to the city to settle down and receive a share, whether land or capital, will likely be difficult to satisfy, and mutual adjustment will also be difficult.
    Second: If they are requesting to be introduced to work in the city, this can be inquired about with various factories to see if they need workers, and it can be notified and discussed in advance, which can be done; or if they come to the city to do business and rent houses, this is also easier to handle.
    Third: Regarding the entire immigration issue, I believe that if it involves relocation within the counties of this sub-district, the Special Commissioner's Office should coordinate based on the situation in each county. If it is within this military region, the military region should coordinate according to the situation. If it is individual immigration, the counties should consult with each other in advance, and individual solutions are also possible. It is absolutely unacceptable to introduce people carelessly without understanding the situation, resulting in poor farmers suffering and unable to find a place to settle down. This is an irresponsible attitude towards the masses. Reader Li Zheng

### 对往城市里移民的意见

　　对往城市里移民的意见编者同志：
    三月二十九日一天中，就有四个农民来长治市政府要求按家。两个是沁水县政府介绍来的，公函上说该农民愿意移在长治市，所以就介绍来了；另外两个是从平遥介绍来的难民，也要求在长市按家。这几个农民都愿意在城内按家，又都要求是种地，因此最后弄了个无法安插。
    我对往城里移民的问题有以下几点意见：
    第一：在城市里，基本上不是平分问题，而是保护工商业和发展工商业问题，有些封建也大部斗垮了，所以想来城里按家分一份，无论是土地和资本，恐怕都难以满足的，互相调剂吧也很困难。
    第二：如果是要求来城市介绍做工，这个还可以征求一下各工厂是否用人，可以预先通知商量，还可以办到；或是来城里做买卖，赁房子，这个都还好办。
    第三：关于整个移民问题，我觉着如系在本分区内各县移的话，应由专署根据各县情况调剂。如在本军区内则应由军区按情况调剂。如系个别移民，县和县预先商量，个别解决亦无不可，绝不能不了解情况，马虎介绍去，结果使贫苦农民受了罪，找不到下落，这是对群众不负责任的态度。　读者　李正
