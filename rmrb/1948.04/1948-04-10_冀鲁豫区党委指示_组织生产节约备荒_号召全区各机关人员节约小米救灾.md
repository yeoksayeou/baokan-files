　　Instructions from the CCP Jilu Yu District Committee
  　Organize Production, Practice Thrift, and Prepare for Famine
    Call on All Cadres in the District to Save Millet for Disaster Relief
    [Jilu Yu News] The CCP Jilu Yu District Committee recently issued instructions on spring plowing production, practicing thrift, and preparing for famine, calling on all party members in the district to mobilize, share weal and woe with the disaster victims, and deeply mobilize and organize the masses to produce and prepare for famine, and ensure that not an acre of land is left uncultivated during the spring plowing. The instructions first stated: The district is one of the major battlefields, and has suffered great damage and plunder by the enemy, as well as great war consumption. For example, in Shan County, a district in the third sub-district of southern Henan, the Jiang bandits seized 966 livestock recently. There are already thousands of households begging for food; and the Yellow River spring project, as well as the war service labor paid by the masses to protect their homes and lives and defeat the Jiang bandits' attacks, require a total of more than three million workdays. This destruction of productive forces caused by enemy disasters and floods is the main reason for the famine. Secondly, although some areas in the district had good harvests last autumn, about one-sixth of the area suffered from excessive rainfall, resulting in floods, so that some households had nothing to eat before the lunar new year. In recent months, due to the concentration of cadres for rectification and reorganization, the understanding of the situation below, especially the disaster situation, has been insufficient, resulting in the disaster relief work being carried out relatively late, and many areas are currently in a serious famine situation. For this reason, the District Committee and the Administrative Office have decided to allocate 250,000 yuan in production loans and 2 million catties of relief grain to the disaster areas as capital for the disaster victims to help themselves through production. At the same time, all party, government, and civilian personnel in the district are called upon to save four taels of millet per person per day starting from April 1st. It is estimated that more than one million catties of millet can be saved in the entire district, which can solve the living problems of more than 10,000 disaster-stricken households. In order to successfully complete this urgent task of spring plowing production and famine preparedness, the instructions have clear provisions on the work guidelines and specific practices for various types of areas: 1. In areas with severe disasters, such as the fourth sub-district, the draft and replenishment movement will be temporarily suspended before the wheat harvest, with spring plowing production and famine preparedness as the central task. As for the second, third, and eighth sub-districts and other areas with more severe disasters, spring plowing production and famine preparedness should also be the primary task. 2. Local party committees should have dedicated personnel to lead the disaster investigation work. 3. After the loans are distributed, governments and financial departments at all levels should concentrate all their efforts to organize the masses to produce, stabilize prices, and ensure that farmers can profit from various production and transportation activities. Ensure that the loaned grain and funds first reach the disaster-stricken households (poor peasants) who have no food to eat and cannot carry out spring plowing production, and then lend them to households (middle peasants) who lack food and have difficulties in spring plowing production, and pay attention to solving the landlords and rich peasants who cannot live or have very little land left, so that they can produce and live. In areas with severe disasters, the task of stretcher-bearing should be reduced or exempted before the wheat harvest, and all troops and organs should help the masses with spring plowing in a planned and organized manner with manpower and animal power. The instructions further pointed out in a confident tone: The current famine in the district is different from the 1942 famine. This time it has the nature of a spring famine, and it is only a partial problem for the whole, and the material conditions are better than during the Japanese occupation in 1942. Therefore, although there are many difficulties (such as the Jiang bandits' harassment in southern Henan, and the late deployment of disaster relief work), as long as the entire party mobilizes, shares weal and woe with the disaster victims, and deeply mobilizes and organizes the masses to produce, practice thrift, and prepare for famine, the above-mentioned difficulties can be overcome.

　　冀鲁豫区党委指示
  　组织生产节约备荒
    号召全区各机关人员节约小米救灾
    【冀鲁豫消息】中共冀鲁豫区党委，日前发出春耕生产节约备荒指示，号召全区党员动员起来，和灾民共甘苦，深入的发动组织群众生产备荒，并保证春耕中不荒一亩地。该指示首称：该区为大战场之一，遭敌人破坏掠夺以及战争消耗极大，如黄河南三分区单县一个区，仅牲口一项最近即被蒋匪抢走九百六十六头，眼下要饭者已达千户；而黄河春季工程，以及群众为保家保命击破蒋匪进攻所支付的战勤工数，共需三百余万。这种敌灾水患所造成的生产力的破坏，是形成灾荒的主要原因。其次，该区去秋虽有一部分地区收成较好，但约六分之一的地区，则由于雨水过大，形成水灾，致使有些户旧历年前就没有吃的了。而近几月来，由于集中干部整编，对下面情况尤其是灾情了解不够，致使救灾工作进行较晚，目前不少地区已处于严重的灾荒情况之下。为此，区党委、行署特决定拨发廿五万万元生产贷款及二百万斤救济粮，分发各灾区，作为灾胞生产自救资本。同时，号召全区党政民人员，自四月一日起每人每日节约四两小米，估计全区可节约一百余万斤小米，能解决一万余户灾胞生活问题。并为了使这紧迫的春耕生产备荒任务胜利完成。指示中对各类地区工作方针及具体作法均有明确规定：一、凡灾情严重地区，如四分区，在麦收前，暂时停止抽补运动，以春耕生产备荒为中心工作。至于二、三、八等分区灾情较重地区，也以春耕生产备荒为首要任务。二、各地党委均需有专人领导灾情调查工作。三、把贷款发放下去后，各级政府及财经部门，要集中全部力量，组织群众生产，稳定物价，保证农民在各种生产及运输中有利可图。保证贷的粮款首先到达无饭吃无法春耕生产的灾户（贫农）手中，然后贷给缺乏粮食及春耕生产中的困难户（中农），并注意解决无法生活或留地很少的地主富农，使其能生产与生活下去。而灾荒重的地区，麦收前应减免担架任务，各部队机关并应有计划有组织地以人力畜力帮助群众春耕。指示更充满自信的语调指出：目前该区灾荒与一九四二年灾荒不同，这次带有春荒性质，而且就全体来说是部分地区，物质条件又较四二年日寇分割时期为佳。因此虽然存在很多困难（如黄河南蒋匪骚扰，救灾工作布置较晚等），但是，只要全党动员起来，和灾民共甘苦，深入发动组织群众生产节约备荒，上述种种困难是不难克服的。
