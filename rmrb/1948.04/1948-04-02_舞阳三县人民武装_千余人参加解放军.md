　　People's Armed Forces of Wuyang Three Counties
    Over a Thousand People Join the People's Liberation Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Su Yu Wan, 31st] Over a thousand members of the people's anti-Chiang self-defense armed forces from the border areas of Wuyang, Yancheng, and Linying counties in Henan Province have gloriously joined the local corps of the Yu Wan Su People's Liberation Army. They were formed into the Independent Regiment of the Fifth Sub-district of Yu Wan Su in early February. The entire regiment is currently engaged in a movement to speak out about suffering, combined with military training. This people's armed force was originally formed spontaneously by local farmers to resist Chiang Kai-shek's conscription, levies, and grain requisitions. At the beginning of last year, it consisted of only a few local cadres, such as Yan Yan, and local young farmers who gathered at night and dispersed during the day, conducting propaganda and organizational activities against Chiang Kai-shek's tyrannical rule. In November of last year, when Chen Xie's army entered the western countryside of Yancheng, Yan Yan led the farmers to search the Chiang Kai-shek township office and found eight rifles, beginning open guerrilla activities. In December, they attacked the Chiang Kai-shek's Xindian town office, seizing one machine gun and eleven long and short guns. This was at a time when the Chen Su and Chen Xie armies had won great victories on the Ping-Han and Long-Hai Railways, which further encouraged the peasants oppressed by Chiang Kai-shek to rise up, seize weapons from reactionary landlords, and arm themselves. Within half a month, the force expanded to over a thousand people.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Su Yu Wan, 31st] A platoon of the Yu Wan Su Xihua County Brigade ambushed near Dengcheng, 80 li northeast of Luohe, on the morning of March 5th, capturing two ten-wheel trucks of the Chiang Kai-shek 11th Division traveling from Luohe to Zhoujiakou. The unit only fired five shots, and the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers got out of the trucks and surrendered immediately, totaling 26 prisoners, plus four drivers. Four guns were seized, along with over 15,000 jin of rice.

　　舞阳三县人民武装
    千余人参加解放军
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖三十一日电】河南舞阳、郾城、临颖三县边境人民抗蒋自卫武装千余人，光荣参加豫皖苏人民解放军地方兵团，已于二月初编为豫皖苏五分区独立团，刻全团正展开诉苦运动并结合练兵运动。该人民武装原为当地农民反抗蒋匪抓丁派款派粮自动组成，去年初仅有地方干部严言和当地青年农民数人，夜聚日散，进行反蒋暴政的宣传组织活动。去年十一月间陈谢大军进驻郾城西乡时，严言率领农民在蒋匪乡公所搜得步枪八支，开始进行公开的游击活动，十二月间袭击蒋匪新店镇公所，缴机枪一挺、长短枪十一支。这时正值陈粟、陈谢大军在平汉陇海路上大获胜利，更加振奋了在蒋匪压榨下的农民，纷起夺取反动地主枪支武装自己，半月内该部即扩大至一千余人。
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖三十一日电】豫皖苏西华县大队一个排，三月五日上午，在漯河东北八十里之邓城附近伏击，俘获蒋匪十一师自漯河驶向周家口的十轮大卡车两辆。该部仅鸣枪五响，蒋匪即下车就俘，计共俘匪二十六人，另司机四人，缴枪四支，大米一万五千多斤。
