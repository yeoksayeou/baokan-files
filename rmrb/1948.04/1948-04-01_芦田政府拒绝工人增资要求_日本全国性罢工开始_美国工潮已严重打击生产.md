　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Tokyo Dispatch: Negotiations between Japanese labor union representatives and the reactionary government regarding wage increases have broken down due to the government's firm rejection of the workers' reasonable demands. As a result, the nationwide strikes planned to begin separately in various regions on the 25th (due to the U.S. occupation forces' prohibition of a general strike by Japanese workers) erupted at midnight on the 24th, starting with tax officials in the Kanto region of central Honshu. According to statistics on the 25th, the number of transportation workers participating in the strike had spread to 22 prefectures and parts of Hokkaido. All transportation, telephone, and telegraph services in the area were paralyzed. On the 26th, another 300,000 public officials held an automatic "day off," and 250,000 workers (including 90,000 transportation workers) joined the strike. Other groups preparing to strike include the Teachers' Union and employees of the Ministry of Finance. Workers are adopting guerrilla tactics, engaging in various flexible strike actions, rising and falling in different regions and sectors. According to labor union representatives, if the government does not accept their reasonable demands, the labor unrest will continue to expand. The strikes have successively halted transportation, taxation, and other services in various regions. After streetcar and bus workers in Tokyo began their first indefinite strike in 14 years on the morning of the 27th, all streetcars and buses have stopped running. Only subways and elevated railways have a few trains still running. Passengers are extremely crowded. A Reuters reporter described the impact of this strike, saying, "It will accelerate the major crisis of the Ashida Cabinet."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: New York Dispatch: The nationwide miners' strike in the United States, which has persisted for more than ten days, has had a significant impact on production, transportation, and other industries. Many steel companies have been forced to partially shut down their blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. The Lackawanna plant of Bethlehem Steel Corporation has reduced production by 30 percent, and many power companies and textile companies will reduce production due to coal shortages. In addition to implementing a 25 percent reduction in passenger transport on the 21st, the U.S. government will further reduce freight transport by 25 percent starting on the 30th, resulting in an estimated 40,000 unemployed railroad workers. The Federal Power Commission also warned that a prolonged miners' strike would lead to a resurgence of the "power reduction" risk from two years ago, plunging major cities into dim lighting. Although strikes at individual factories have been settled and ended amidst the current nationwide strike wave, the major strike by meatpacking workers is still ongoing, and more labor unions are constantly joining the strike wave. According to a United Press report on the 26th, at least 514,000 people across the country have been involved in strikes.

　　芦田政府拒绝工人增资要求
    日本全国性罢工开始
　  美国工潮已严重打击生产
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】东京讯：日本各工会代表与反动政府间的增资谈判，已因政府坚拒工人合理要求而宣告破裂。这样，预定于二十五日开始的全国性的各地分别罢工（因美占领军禁止日工人总罢工），即在二十四日午夜自本州中部关东地区税务员首先爆发。交通工人参加罢工者，仅二十五日统计，即蔓延二十二县及北海道一部分地区。该区所有交通电话、电报等皆陷于瘫痪状态。二十六日，又有三十万公共机关职员举行自动“放假”及二十五万工人（其中交通工人占九万）参加罢工。其他准备罢工的尚有教师联合会，大藏省职工等。工人采取游击战方式，在各地方、各业部门中，进行此起彼落的各种灵活性的罢工斗争。据工会代表说：如政府不接受他们的合理要求，工潮将继续扩大。罢工已使各地交通、税务等相继停顿。东京的电车与公共汽车工人，于二十七日晨开始十四年来首次无限期罢工后，一切电车及公共汽车均已停驶。现仅地下铁道及高架铁道尚有少数通车。乘客拥挤不堪。路透社记者描写此一罢工影响说：“将会加速促成芦田内阁的大危机。”
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】纽约讯：坚持已达十余日的美全国范围的矿工大罢工，已给生产运输等业以巨大的冲击。许多炼钢公司被迫部分地停闭了它们的鼓风炉、马丁炉。伯利恒大炼钢公司的拉卡瓦那工厂，已减产百分之三十，许多电力公司及纺织公司均将因缺煤而减产。美政府除已于二十一日实行减少客运百分之二十五外，将自三十日起再减少货运百分之二十五，铁路工人因此失业者估计在四万人以上。联邦动力委员会并预告说：矿工的持久罢工，将使电力供应有恢复两年前“减电”危险，使各大城市处于灯光昏黯之中。目前带有全国性的罢工浪潮中，虽有个别工厂的罢工已告妥协结束，但肉类包装工人的大罢工仍在坚持，并有更多的工会不断涌入罢工浪潮。据合众社二十六日统计，全国至少有五十一万四千人卷入了罢工。
