　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th: In villages and settlements in Northeast China that have undergone reclassification of class status combined with production mobilization, farmers' production enthusiasm has generally increased. In Dongqingsheng, Tangyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, land and property were returned to eight middle-peasant households during the reclassification, and they were immediately helped to solve the problem of eight livestock and some horse feed. At the same time, through the village branch committee, the poor and lower-middle peasant association, and the peasant representative congress, the principle of hard work leading to prosperity was repeatedly explained. The production enthusiasm of middle peasants quickly stabilized, and they actively participated in spring plowing preparations. Dian Zhongnong (tenant middle peasant) Sun Yude (who was previously classified as a rich peasant) and middle peasant Wang Zhenduo, who were corrected this time, received back the livestock and grain that had been confiscated. Middle peasant Fan Yunsheng was helped by the farmers' association with 80,000 yuan to buy a cow, and they are all working hard to prepare for spring plowing. A wealthy middle peasant in a certain village was not struggled against, but his family of seven ate four large fat pigs during the Chinese New Year and sold the grain. The whole family was not in the mood for production. After this class division, they became active again, collecting firewood and manure, and working hard. After the class division in Minzhong Township, Hailun County, Heilongjiang, unconditional compensation was given to middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against, including four horses and grain and clothing, which helped them solve the difficulties of production materials. Now all the farmers in the township are rushing to collect and deliver manure, determined to maintain last year's title of "production model." After correcting the wrongly classified components and uniting the wrongly struggled rich middle peasants into the farmers' association in Xinxing Village, Mulan County, Songjiang Province, and giving them consideration in the distribution of floating income, the worried middle peasants were all relieved and became very active in delivering manure and firewood. There was not a single idle person in the whole village. After Ren Fu, a middle peasant in Ren Wanliangtun, Hulan, had his class status returned and his belongings returned, he competed with the poor and lower-middle peasants in production, fearing falling behind, and was delivering manure in the evening. He said, "Now I have a bottom line! If I don't work hard to produce and get rich now, when will I?" Before mobilizing the landlords to go out to cut reeds in Dakeng Village, Longjiang County, Nenjiang Province, the farmers' association told them: "From now on, the things you earn from your own labor are your own, and we don't want them." The landlords had a bottom line and were very active in cutting firewood and producing, cutting thirty carts in six days.

　　东北各地纠偏结合生产
  　农民生产情绪提高
    【新华社东北十五日电】东北各地经过重划阶级结合生产动员的村屯，农民生产情绪普遍提高。合江省汤原县东庆升在重划阶级中，退回八户中农的土地财产，并立即帮助其解决八个牲口及一部马料，同时经过村支部会、贫雇农会及农民代表大会，反复说明勤劳致富的道理，中农生产情绪迅速稳定，积极参加备耕。佃中农孙玉德（过去被划为富农）和中农王振铎，这次纠正成份领回被征收的牲口粮食，中农范云生，农会帮助他八万元，买了一条牛，他们都努力准备春耕。大屯某富裕中农未被斗争，但过年时全家七口人吃了四头大肥猪，把粮食也卖了，一家人全没心情生产，此次划阶级后又积极起来，打柴积粪，积极努力干。黑龙江海伦县民众乡划完阶级后，对错斗之中农无条件补偿，计补给马四匹及粮食衣服等，使他们解决生产资料的困难，现全乡农民都在突击拾粪送粪，决心保持去年“生产模范”的称号。松江木兰县新兴村经过纠正错划成份与团结被斗错的富裕中农入农会，并在分浮时予以照顾后，在顾虑的中农都安下心来，送粪打柴都很积极，全村没有一个闲人。呼兰任万良屯中农任富划回阶级退回东西后，与贫雇农比赛生产，惟恐落后，晚上都在送粪，他说：“可摸着底啦！现在还不好好生产发财，等什么时候呢！”嫩江省龙江县大坑村在发动地主出发打苇子前，农会就告诉他们：“今后你们自己劳动所得的东西，就是你们自己的，我们不要。”地主们有了底，打柴生产都很积极，六天就打了三十多车。
