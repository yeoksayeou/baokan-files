Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: New York dispatch: The wage increase strike struggle of the American working class continues to persist and expand. The nationwide coal miners' strike has lasted for sixteen days as of March 31st and continues to bravely persist. This strike has already forced a sharp reduction in steel industry production and "endangered the national economy" (Associated Press). According to figures released by steel industry agencies: total steel production last week was 95.7 percent, and this week it has dropped to 89.4 percent. If the strike continues for another two weeks, steel production will be reduced by 40 percent; and will force the government to ration steel and other important materials. The Department of Commerce also lamented that steel skin factories will reduce productivity by about 65 percent next week. At the same time, the wage increase strike of workers at the Wall Street Stock Exchange is gradually expanding. Striking workers issued a warning on the 31st that a general strike would be held in the entire Wall Street financial district. In addition, workers from the AFL International Printing Union are on strike in nine cities demanding wage increases. At the American Sugar Refining Company factory in southern Boston, 800 CIO workers also launched a wage increase strike on March 31st.
