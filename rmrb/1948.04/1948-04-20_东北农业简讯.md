　　Northeast Agriculture Briefs
　　◇ The Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee is vigorously organizing the transfer of draft animals. As of now, Heilongjiang, Hejiang, Jilin, Songjiang, and Mudanjiang provinces have transferred more than 37,500 draft animals, including approximately 18,000 head of cattle and horses purchased from other areas, which have now all been put into production.
　　◇ Of the 1.5 billion yuan in agricultural loans issued by the Nenjiang Provincial Government, 720 million yuan has already been used to purchase 150 shi of "Kehua" wheat seeds for experimental planting in Nehe County. In addition, 50 million jin of rice seeds, 4 million jin of soybean seeds, 4 million jin of soybean cake, and loans of 10 million yuan are all interest-free loans to the masses, to be repaid after the autumn harvest. The remaining 200 million yuan is used as water conservancy loans for the provincial government's Construction Department to build the Chahayang water conservancy project, which is expected to be completed by the end of this month. It is estimated to help the masses open up more than 10,000 qing of paddy fields, with a minimum yield of 4,000 jin (10 liang per jin) per qing, producing 40 million jin.
　　◇ The Heilongjiang Provincial Construction Department has established two tractor training classes in Bei'an and Tongbei to promote the use of machinery for farming. There are more than 150 students in total, who will soon be assigned to various places to participate in spring plowing.
　　◇ An epizootic broke out among some livestock in Liuhe County, Liaoning. The government immediately organized veterinarians throughout the county to form a research association to rescue the livestock and organized three treatment teams to go to the countryside for intensive treatment, ensuring that spring plowing is not delayed.
