Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 21st: According to news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: Workers in Tianjin and Guangzhou are continuing their anti-hunger wage increase movement. On the 3rd of this month, over 600 employees of the Dagu Salt Field Office of the Tianjin District Chiang Kai-shek bandit Changlu Salt Administration went on strike to demand a pay raise. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits carried out armed suppression, and three workers were arrested. In addition, the workers of the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau, because the bureau was forced to agree to pay the workers their salary for the first half of April based on the full salary of March; and to issue a housing allowance of 500,000 yuan per person for January, February, and March, victoriously resumed work on the 3rd.

Another dispatch: Since the price surge in Guangzhou in February, workers in various industries have unanimously demanded that employers pay wages based on grain and increase benefits. For example, workers in the printing industry are demanding 180 jin of rice per month; elevator workers are demanding that their January wage adjustment be converted into grain based on the retail price of rice at that time; in addition, workers in the theater, oil pressing, and textile industries are demanding a wage increase of 100% to 150%. Workers in the machinery, Western medicine, tailoring, watchmaking, laundry, public transport, rice milling, and maritime industries are all unanimously demanding improved benefits.

　　天津广州工人展开增资罢工
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据蒋区报刊消息：津穗工人反饥饿的增资运动继续展开。本月三日天津区蒋匪长芦盐管局大沽盐田办事处，全体员工六百余人为要求加薪举行罢工，蒋匪竟实行武力镇压，工人三名被捕。又蒋匪塘沽新港工程局工人，因局方被迫答允工人所提四月份上半月薪津按三月份全月薪津之数发给；一、二、三月份房租津贴每人发给五十万元等要求，已于三日胜利复工。
    另讯：广州市自二月物价涨风以后，各业工人一致向资方提出以粮食为本位发工资及提高待遇要求，如印刷业工人，要求每月发大米一百八十斤；电梯业工人要求以一月份调整工资数目照当时零售米价折合粮食发给；此外戏院业、榨油业、纺织业工人，则要求加薪百分之一百到一百五十。其余机器业、西药业、裁缝业、钟表业、洗衣业、公共汽车、碾米业及海员工人，都一致要求提高待遇。
