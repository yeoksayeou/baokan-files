[Jilu Yu News] A report from the Xian Zhuangji work team in Qingfeng Fifth District: During the land reform last year, Xian Zhuangji seriously violated the middle peasant policy, and the land distribution was unreasonable, making the lives of poor peasants very difficult. After the work team arrived in Xian Zhuangji, they held a small forum in Dong Yan Guai. The masses brought up the "voluntary and automatic" saying from last year: "It's not voluntary if you don't do it. Last year, several middle peasant families were robbed. Who wouldn't be afraid if they were similar to middle peasants? Everyone was so scared. They felt that voluntarily taking out money and grain would be more glorious and better than being robbed." Under these circumstances, even households without grain or money "volunteered" a lot, mostly borrowing from others. Poor peasant Yan Shuxin said, "I even voluntarily gave three dou of grain." Even small vendors offered a few catties of wine and a few packs of cigarettes to the village cadres. In Dong Yan Guai alone, out of 49 households (37 poor peasant households and 12 middle peasant households), 13 "volunteered," some giving 50,000 yuan and others giving two dou of grain. Yan Changxing, a family of nine with twelve mu of land (also engaged in vinegar and oil business), was classified as a middle peasant last year. He said, "I also voluntarily gave 50,000 yuan." Ma Liangcai, a family of five with nine mu of land, also ran a teahouse and sold water. They wanted to struggle against him and took away his cow. He spent 50,000 yuan to redeem the cow. In short, village cadres forced 200 households in the whole village to "volunteer." In addition, the village cadres were also unreasonable in land distribution. Poor peasant Wei Lianzhong was allocated several mu of land that was bad and far away. An old woman living alone was given land more than three li away from her home, making it impossible for her to farm. Poor peasant Yan Fuqing said, "Households that originally had good land were given good land again, while those who originally didn't have good land were given bad land." After the work team arrived in the village, they repeatedly publicized the Outline Land Law and the middle peasant policy, as well as methods for re-allocation and compensation. After the publicity, the middle peasants' emotions were relatively stable. They said, "After your explanation, we dare to speak. During the land reform before, we middle peasants were not allowed to participate in meetings, and we couldn't figure anything out. We were afraid of struggle all day long." In addition, it was decided to lend the fruits of struggle to the poor peasants who had no food to eat to maintain their lives.
    Editor's note: What policies did the work team adopt regarding this behavior that infringes upon the interests of middle peasants? The article only mentions publicizing the middle peasant policy and solving some difficulties for poor peasants. How should the "voluntarily" given property of the middle peasants be handled? A definite attitude should be adopted.

    仙庄集侵害了中农
    只见解释没提解决办法
    【冀鲁豫消息】清丰五区仙庄集工作组报导：去年土改中，仙庄集严重的违犯了中农政策，并且分配土地不合理，贫农生活也很困难。工作组到仙庄集后，在东阎拐召开了个小座谈会，群众提起了去年的“自愿自动”说：“不自愿也不行，去年把中农抢了几家，其他与中农相差不多的户，谁还不害怕？都吓的骨酥了，觉着自动的把款粮拿出来，又落个光荣，比抢一下好的多。”在这种情况下，甚至没粮没钱的户，自动的也不少，自己没钱，多是转借别人的。贫农阎书信说：“我还自动了三斗粮食。”连小商贩也拿出几斤酒几条烟，献给村干部。仅东阎拐四十九户人家中（贫农三十七户，中农十二户），就有十三户“自动”的，多的拿出五万元，少的拿出二斗粮食。阎长兴九口人，十二亩地（兼买卖醋油），去年划阶级把他划成中农，他说：“我还自动了五万元”。马良才五口人，九亩地，另外开茶铺卖水，要斗争他，拉走了他的牛，他花五万元才把牛赎回来。总之，村干部强迫“自动”的，全村就有二百户。另外村干在分配土地上也不合理，贫农魏连重分了几亩地，又坏又远；有一个老大娘一个人过日子，分给她的地离家三里多，使她没法种。贫农阎福庆说：“本来有好地的户，又分给他好地，有的本来没好地，又分给他坏地。”工作组到村后，反复宣传土地法大纲和中农政策和抽补办法。经过宣传，中农情绪比较稳定了。他们说：“你们这一说，我们就敢说话了。从前土改时不叫俺中农参加会，俺啥事也摸不清，成天害怕斗争。”另外贫农眼下没饭吃的，决定把斗争果实借给他们维持生活。
    编者按：工作组对这种侵害中农利益的行为，究竟采取什么方针？文中只见宣传了中农政策，并解决了点贫农困难，对于错误“自动”财物的中农如何处理？应有肯定的态度。
