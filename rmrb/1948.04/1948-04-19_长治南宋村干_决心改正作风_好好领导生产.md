[Taixing News] Changzhi Nansong Village cadres are reviewing their leadership in production and are determined to shed their old work style and establish a new one. Since participating in the district-wide spring plowing mobilization meeting, the village cadres have resolved to lead the masses well in spring plowing production. However, due to the old work style being impacted in their thinking and a new work style not being established, they are still constrained and work is flowing freely. Qin Xiaozhong, chairman of the Farmers' Association, said: "These past two days, working is like going down a coal mine without a lamp, not knowing if going forward is right or backward is right, it's really killing me! We don't dare use the old methods (for fear of making mistakes), and we don't have new methods." The leadership discovered this thinking and, on the nights of the 5th and 6th of this month, convened 37 key cadres from the whole village to discuss what shortcomings there were in the past leadership style and what good methods should be used in the future? In the discussion, everyone agreed that there were several bad work styles in leading production last year that must be resolutely eliminated. (1) Competing for personal reputation at the expense of the interests of the masses. The village chief said: "During the autumn plowing last year, I boasted to the district and Meng Shuzhi, a labor hero of the Fifth District, and forced the masses to plow at night, causing a man over fifty years old to fall and get hurt. Cui Baoxian had more than 20 mu of land and hadn't finished harvesting the soybeans, but I forced him to dig the land, wasting the people's grain." (2) Organizing mutual aid for selfish gain. Bai Changzhi, the mutual aid team leader, said: "Last year, the weather was bad during the autumn harvest. In order to harvest my own two mu of grain, I actively led people to help each other. After I finished harvesting, I didn't lead everyone well. I did the work to the end and paid the wages to the end." (3) Using administrative orders to scare the masses into mutual aid production, always talking with an attitude. For example, the director of the Armed Forces Committee said: "Last year, mutual aid was not energetic, but instead of studying and solving specific problems, I just forced people, and cursed the masses to go to the fields on the radio before dawn." (4) Unclear lines in production. For example, the political director said: "Last year, when organizing women to learn weaving in factories, cadres and activists selected some eloquent and beautiful women (mostly middle peasants, a few rich peasants). Some poor laborers who went to learn were just errand boys. As a result, poor women couldn't afford new clothes for the New Year. Because I was afraid that the superiors would say that the village's work was not good and that the cadres would lose face, I held a meeting to scare people, saying: 'It won't do if you don't wear new clothes.' Therefore, the poor women ran away when they saw me." After everyone discussed that these bad work styles must be eliminated, if they continue as before, they will inevitably be opposed by the masses. Then, the methods of leading production in the future were discussed to establish a new democratic work style. The Xinhua Daily News published a short commentary based on this, calling on village-level cadres to resolutely eliminate the old work style and establish a new leadership style in leading production work. Briefly stated: Recently, many counties and districts have convened meetings of village cadres and mass representatives to mobilize spring plowing, break the cadres' idea of lying down and not working, and strengthen production leadership. But how to stand up? How to lead? This question has not been completely resolved. Nansong Village in Changzhi raised this question... This is universal. Therefore, county and district leaders must not be satisfied with the mobilization of large meetings, they must follow up to solve this problem. ... Although production villages are not engaged in democratic rectification today, the improvement of the relationship between cadres and the masses in the production movement cannot be ignored. If this is done well in production, it is not only the key to doing a good job in the production movement, but also lays a good foundation for future party rectification and democratic rectification.

　　长治南宋村干
  　决心改正作风　好好领导生产
    【太行消息】长治南宋村干检查生产领导，并决心去掉旧作风，建立新作风。该村村干部，自参加了全区春耕生产动员大会后，决心要好好领导群众春耕生产，但在思想上因旧的一套作风受到打击，新的作风没有树立，所以还是束手束脚，工作上表现自流。农会主席秦小忠说：“这两天工作和下煤窑不点灯一样，不知往前对往后对，真是难死人！旧办法不敢用（怕犯错），新办法又没有”。领导上发现了这种思想，于本月五、六两夜召集全村三十七个主要干部开会，讨论过去领导作风上有那些毛病，今后领导上该用那些好办法？咯吵中，一致认识去年领导生产有几种坏作风，必须坚决去掉。（一）为自己争名誉，损害群众利益。村长说：“去年秋耕，在区上和五区劳动英雄孟树只挑战夸下海口，回来强迫群众夜间耕地，跌坏一个五十多岁的老汉。崔保先有二十余亩地，没割完带的豆，硬叫人家掘地，糟塌了群众的粮食。（二）组织互助自私自利。互助大队长白长只说：“去年秋收天气不好，为了把自己二亩谷割了，积极领导人家互助，自己收完后，再不好好领导大家干了。做生活做到头，出工资出到后”。（三）行政命令吓唬群众互助生产，说话老是起态度。如武委会主任说：“去年互助不起劲，但不研究解决具体问题，只是硬逼，天不明就拿上广播筒硬骂群众上地”。（四）生产中路线不明。如政治主任说：“去年组织妇女到工厂学纺织，干部和积极分子就挑选了些能说会道的漂亮妇女（大部是中农，少数是富农），有些贫雇去学也是当跑堂孩哩。结果贫农妇女过年穿不上新衣服，自己怕上级说村上工作不好，丢干部的脸，就开会吓唬人家说：穿不上新衣服不行，因此，穷人家妇女一见躲着就跑”。经大家讨论这些坏作风必须去掉，如仍然照旧干，必然遭到群众反对。接着讨论出今后领导生产的方法，树立民主新作风。新华日报据此发表短论，号召村级干部在领导生产工作中坚决去掉旧作风，建立新的领导作风。略称：最近不少县区都召开了村干部和群众代表会，动员春耕，打破干部躺倒不干的思想，加强生产领导。但如何站起来？怎样领导？这个问题还没有得到完全的解决。长治南宋村提出了这个问题，………这是带有普遍性的。因此，县区领导上，绝不能满足于开大会的动员，必须紧跟着去解决这个问题。……今天生产村虽然不搞民主填补，但生产运动中干群关系的改善却不能忽视。如在生产中这一点做得好，不仅是生产运动搞好的关键，而且给将来整党民主填补打下很好的基础。
