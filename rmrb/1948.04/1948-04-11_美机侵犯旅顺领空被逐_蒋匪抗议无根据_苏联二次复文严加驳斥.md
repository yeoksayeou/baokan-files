Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: According to TASS Moscow, 5th, on April 3rd, the Soviet Embassy in Nanjing submitted another written reply to the Chiang Kai-shek government, responding to the further sophistry in the Chiang clique's Ministry of Foreign Affairs' "aide-mémoire" of March 18th to the Soviet Embassy in Nanjing regarding the illegal intrusion into Lushun airspace by aircraft of the American imperialist Chennault Air Transport Command on March 8th. In the Chiang side's "aide-mémoire," they distorted the facts, falsely claiming that Chennault's aircraft did not fly into the Lushun naval base area, and falsely accused the Soviet side of "disregarding Chinese sovereignty" by driving away Chennault's aircraft. The Soviet Embassy in Nanjing sternly refuted this in its reply, pointing out: Soviet patrol aircraft discovered the aforementioned aircraft at 5:14 PM on March 8th within the Lushun naval base area, at coordinates 39 degrees 3 minutes north latitude and 121 degrees 6 minutes east longitude; at 5:58 PM, the aircraft was at 38 degrees 51 minutes north latitude and 121 degrees 3 minutes east longitude, also within the naval base area. It further pointed out: The Soviet command had not received any notification of the aforementioned aircraft's flight; therefore, when an unidentified aircraft was discovered, the measures usually taken in such circumstances were adopted. Needless to say, the Soviet patrol aircraft's request for the aircraft appearing within the naval base to land was in accordance with the regulations established for the Lushun naval base, which is consistent with the system usually practiced in land and naval bases. The Soviet command's right to issue such orders is based on the Sino-Soviet Agreement on Lushun Port of August 14, 1945. According to this agreement, the Soviet government is authorized to defend the Lushun naval base. The reply concluded: In view of this, the Soviet Embassy considers the protest lodged in the Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek clique's) Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note to be completely unfounded and requests that the Chiang government notify the Lushun Soviet command in advance in the future if any Chinese civilian aircraft passes through the airspace and territorial waters of the Lushun naval base. (Note: After the American imperialist Chennault's aircraft invaded the airspace over the Lushun naval port on March 8th and was driven away by Soviet aircraft, the Chiang Kai-shek clique defended its American master and lodged a "protest" with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Embassy in China replied on March 13th, pointing out that the Chiang side had distorted the facts and refusing to accept its unreasonable protest.)

　　美机侵犯旅顺领空被逐
  　蒋匪抗议无根据
  　苏联二次复文严加驳斥
    【新华社陕北八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：四月三日苏联驻南京大使馆又以复文一件提交蒋政府，答复蒋匪外交部三月十八日致苏联南京大使馆“节略”中对三月八日美帝陈纳德空运大队飞机违法侵入旅顺领空的再次诡辩。蒋方“节略”中歪曲事实，诡称陈纳德飞机并未飞入旅顺海军基地区域，并反诬苏方驱逐陈纳德飞机为“蔑视中国主权”。苏联驻南京大使馆复文对此严加驳斥，指出：苏联巡逻机系于三月八日下午五时十四分，发现上述飞机于旅顺海军基地区域以内的北纬三十九度三分及东经一二一度六分之领空上；至五时五十八分时，该机即在北纬三十八度五十一分及东经一二一度三分的领空上，亦在海军基地的区域内。继指出：苏联指挥部未曾接获上述飞机航行通知，因此，当一旦发现有来历不明的飞机时，即采取通常在这种情况下所采取的措施。毋庸说：苏巡逻机要求在海军基地以内出现的飞机随其着陆一举，是符合旅顺海军基地区所订的规章的，而此规章亦与通常行使于陆海军基地的制度一致。苏联指挥部制定此种命令的权利，系以一九四五年八月十四日关于旅顺口的中苏协定为基础。根据该协定，苏联政府被授权保卫旅顺海军基地。复文归结说：苏联大使馆有鉴于此，认为中国（蒋匪）外交部照会中所提出的抗议毫无根据，并要求蒋政府于今后如有中国民航机经过旅顺海军基地的领空及领海，须事先通知旅顺口苏联指挥部（按：三月八日美帝陈纳德飞机侵入旅顺军港上空为苏机驱逐后，蒋匪即为其美国主子辩护，向苏联提出“抗议”，苏驻华大使馆当于三月十三日复文指出蒋方歪曲事实，拒绝接受其无理抗议。）
