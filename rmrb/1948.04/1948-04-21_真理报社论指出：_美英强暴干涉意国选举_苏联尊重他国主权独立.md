Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Moscow Dispatch: *Pravda* published an editorial titled "On the Eve of Italian Elections," pointing out that the election process will determine "whether Italy will take the road of a sovereign country or the road of an American colony and a military strategic base." The newspaper thoroughly analyzed the hypocrisy of so-called American aid, stating: "The lessons of the history of international relations teach us that the essence of the foreign policy of this or that country should be judged by its actual actions rather than by flowery words." "Those who have turned Italy into their affiliated factories, manipulated Italian commerce and finance, and found their own paradise in Italian colonies are precisely those who talk glibly about 'friendship' with Italy and are prepared to give it 'disinterested assistance.'" *Pravda* asked: Why do the US and British ruling groups make various hypocritical promises, but remain silent on the issue of returning Italian colonies to Italian trusteeship? "Is this not because they are determined to occupy Italian colonies and are preparing to establish their strategic bases there?" *Pravda* emphasized that the attitude towards Italy once again proves the two lines in international politics: one is the line consistently pursued by the Soviet Union of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, respecting their sovereignty, independence, and freedom, which has been highly praised and profoundly understood by the broad masses of the Italian people. The other line is the line of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries, interfering in their internal affairs, and imposing foreign will and policies on these countries. The real cause and root of the Italian crisis after the war is primarily due to the line of foreign policy imposed on it from the outside by the US and British ruling groups. This anti-national and anti-democratic line constitutes a serious danger to Italy.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: New York, 14th: The American people continue to oppose American imperialism's interference in the Italian elections. Recently, 75 prominent American labor activists (mostly of Italian descent) sent a letter to the Italian General Confederation of Labor, protesting the State Department's interference in the Italian elections. The letter said: The purpose of American interference is to intimidate Italian voters, which violates the thoughts and feelings of the American people. Another dispatch: Eighty-four prominent American writers, artists, actors, clergymen, etc., recently sent a telegram to Truman and the major Italian political parties, saying: We vehemently oppose American interference in the Italian elections, and we demand the termination of all external interference in the Italian election process.

　　真理报社论指出：
    美英强暴干涉意国选举  苏联尊重他国主权独立
    【新华社陕北十八日电】莫斯科讯：真理报以“意选举前夕”为题发表社论指出：在选举过程中，将决定“意大利将走主权国的道路抑美国殖民地和军事战略屯兵场的道路。”该报透彻地分析了所谓美援的虚伪性称：“国际关系的历史教训了我们，要判断这一或那一国家外交政策的本质，是以他的实际行为而不是以花言巧语来判断。”“那些把意大利变为他们附属工厂、操纵意商务和财政以及在意殖民地中发了现他们自己乐园的人们，恰恰正是那些高谈阔论对意‘友好’和准备给它‘大公无私的援助’的人们。”真理报发问：为什么美英统治集团作各种虚伪诺言，而在将意殖民地交还意国托管的问题上却默不作声呢？“这难道不是因为他们坚欲占有意殖民地并正准备在那儿建立他们的战略基地吗？”真理报强调指出：对意态度重新证明了国际政策中的两条路线：一是苏联一贯所奉行的不干涉他国内政、尊重其主权、独立和自由的政策的路线，这一路线已得到意大利广大人民的高度赞扬和深刻的认识。另一条是侵犯别国主权、干涉别国内政、把外国意志和政策强加于这些国家的路线。战后意大利危机的真正原因和根源，首先就是由于美英统治集团自外部强加于它的外交政策的路线，这种反民族反民主的路线，对意大利构成了严重的危险。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】纽约十四日讯：美人民继续反对美帝干涉意国大选。日前，美国七十五名著名职工运动者（多数为祖籍意大利）致函意总工会，抗议国务院干涉意国选举。该函说：美国干涉的目的在恫吓意选民，这违反了美国人民的思想与感情。另讯：美国八十四个著名的作家、艺术家、演员、牧师等，顷致电杜鲁门与意各大政党说：我们猛烈反对美国人干涉意大选，我们要求终止意选举程序中一切外界的干涉。
