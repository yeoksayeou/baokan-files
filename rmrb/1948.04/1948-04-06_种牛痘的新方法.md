　　New Method of Vaccination
　　It is now the time when smallpox is prevalent. The methods of vaccination generally used by rural doctors are too old. The new method of vaccination from the Jin-Sui Medical Experiment Institute is introduced as follows:
　　First, select fresh, unexpired, unheated, and unexposed to sunlight vaccinia lymph. You must choose those with intact packaging. Those that have expired, been exposed to sunlight, been heated for a long time, or have broken glass tubes should not be used again.
　　Second, the person to be vaccinated should take a bath and change clothes. The clothes should not be too tight. Each vial of vaccinia lymph can be used to vaccinate ten to fifteen people, so it is advisable to organize those to be vaccinated to save on supplies.
　　Third, wipe the area near the attachment point of the deltoid muscle of the vaccinated person's left arm with 70% alcohol. After the alcohol has dried, the lymph can be dripped. Before breaking the ends of the vaccinia lymph tube, wipe them carefully with alcohol cotton for disinfection. One of the broken ends can be inserted into the center of a sterilized short, thin rubber tube. Then squeeze the ends of the rubber tube with two fingers, and the lymph will drip out. If this kind of rubber tube cannot be found, you can gently blow on one end of it with your mouth to make a small drop of lymph drip onto the sterilized skin. Do not drip too much lymph; about the size of a sorghum grain is sufficient. If too much lymph is dripped, the pockmark will be too large, and the chances of infection will increase. Do not let the dripped lymph contaminate the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or lips, otherwise there is a risk of blindness or rashes on the mucous membranes. After the lymph is dripped, use a large sewing needle that has been sterilized by burning in a flame and cooled. Use the needle tip to continuously press the lymph area flatly twenty to thirty times (adults), fifteen to twenty times (children), until the pressed area is only slightly red, or slightly raised in white, or only slightly broken and oozing light red blood. Do not have any bleeding or too deep skin breakage. The needle pressing area only needs to be the size of a mung bean, not too large; do not use too much force when pressing. All of the above procedures should be carried out in a place free from wind, dust, and direct sunlight. The broken end of the vaccinia tube should be wrapped in sterile cotton wool to prevent it from being contaminated with dust. It is best to use it all at once. The end that has been blown on with the mouth should not be confused with the end that drips the lymph to avoid infection.
　　Fourth, do not expose the vaccinated area to the sun after pressing with the needle. After the lymph is slightly dry, wipe off the excess with a dry sterile cotton ball. You can put on clothes without bandaging. It is sufficient to vaccinate one or two spots, no need to vaccinate many. The production of immunity is not related to the number and size of the grains. The past method of forceful cutting is not appropriate.

### 种牛痘的新方法

　　种牛痘的新方法
    现在正是天花流行的时候，关于种牛痘的方法，一般乡村医生使用的办法都太旧了，现将晋绥医疗试验所种牛痘的新办法介绍如下：
    第一、要选新鲜未过期的及未受热未见日光的牛痘苗，而必须择封装完整者，凡已失效或曝于日光及受热较久、玻璃管断裂者均不可再用。
    第二，要被种痘的人应先洗澡并换衫衣，衫衣不可太紧，每枝痘苗可种十至十五人，故宜将种痘者组织起来种，可较节约。
    第三、将受种人的左臂三角肌附着处附近，以百分之七十的火酒擦净，俟火酒干后，方可滴浆苗。牛痘苗管之两端在折断前，亦应以火酒棉花，妥为擦净消毒；其折断之一端，可插入一已消毒之短小细橡皮管的中央，然后以两指挤橡皮管之两端，浆苗即滴出。如找不到此种橡皮管，可以口轻吹其一端，使浆苗滴出一小滴于已消毒之皮肤上。滴出之浆苗不可过多，约只有高粱颗大小已足。如滴苗过多，疹疤即将过大，染菌机会即多。滴浆苗切不可沾染眼、鼻、口唇之粘膜，否则有瞎目或粘膜发疹之危险。浆苗滴出后，即用已在火焰上烧灼消毒又已冷的大缝衣针尖，在浆苗处连续平压二十至三十次（大人），十五至二十次（小儿），以只见被压处稍呈红色，或稍有白色隆起，或只稍呈破皮而渗出淡红色血液为度。万不可有出血或破皮过深现象。针压面积只有绿豆大小已足，不可过大；压时不可用力过重。以上手续均应在无风尘及无日光直射的地方进行。已折断的痘苗管端，宜以消毒棉花包裹，万勿使之着染灰尘，最好一次用完。其以口吹过之端与滴浆之端不可相混淆，以免染菌。
    第四、针压过之后不可晒太阳，浆苗稍干，即可以干的消毒棉球拭去其多余部分，可以穿衣，不必包扎。种痘一颗至二颗已足，不必多种。免疫力产生与颗粒多少及大小均无关。过去用力割法不妥。
