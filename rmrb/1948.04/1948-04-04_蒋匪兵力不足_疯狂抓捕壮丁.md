Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, 1st Dispatch: Frontline reporters report: Chiang bandits are frantically conscripting laborers in the Xincai, Runan, and Xiangcheng areas. In the two days of the 29th and 30th of the lunar December, Chiang bandit's 11th Division conscripted over ten thousand young men in the area within thirty miles of Wanmiaoji and Ganglidian west of Xiangcheng. The slogan of the Chiang bandit army's conscription is: "Arrest whoever tries to escape." The method of conscription is to arrest people piecemeal under the pretext of finding guides, or to suddenly surround markets and arrest people collectively. On the 29th, Chiang bandits suddenly surrounded several markets such as Miaowan and Weidian, and arrested all the young men on the markets. In Weidian market alone, more than 500 people were arrested. In villages such as Guanyin Temple and Xiaolizhuang, Chiang bandits falsely claimed to be convening meetings of the masses and arrested all the young men in the villages. On the 29th, Cao Wanfang, a farmer from Xiaocaomiao, was getting married when he was intercepted by Chiang bandits on the way, and Cao Wanfang, along with the sedan carriers and musicians, were all tied up and taken away. There are currently nine blind people in a certain village in Runan, all of whom blinded themselves to avoid being conscripted by the Chiang bandits. Wherever the Chiang bandits pass, the conscripted young men are tied together with ropes, and men, women, old, and young cry and follow, the sound of tugging at clothes and stamping feet shaking the fields. Every day, more than 500 family members of those conscripted in Runan city go to the city to look for their sons and husbands, but they are all beaten back by the Chiang bandits and not allowed to enter the city. The Chiang bandits also threaten the conscripted, saying: "Whoever deserts will have their whole family killed." In a village in Xiangcheng, an old lady named Jia, who is over sixty years old, had her two sons conscripted by the Chiang bandit's 11th Division. She led her two daughters-in-law to complain to reporters, saying: "I have begged for food and dug up vegetable roots, enduring all kinds of hardships, to raise my eldest son to eighteen years old, and he was conscripted by that damned old Chiang thirty years ago. His father was so heartbroken that he got sick and had nothing to eat or drink, and died of starvation. I endured hunger and cold, and finally managed to raise my second child. Last year, he rented more than ten acres of land from others, and I thought I could finally see the end of my suffering. Who knew that on the 29th of the Lunar New Year, old Chiang's 11th Division conscripted my second child again." Old lady Jia told the reporter the names of her two sons, saying: "They are unwilling to sell their lives for old Chiang and will come over as soon as the fighting starts. I hope you will pay attention to checking the prisoners."

　　蒋匪兵力不足
  　疯狂抓捕壮丁
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖一日电】前线记者报导：蒋匪在新蔡、汝南、项城一带，疯狂抓丁，旧历十二月二十九、三十两天内蒋匪十一师在项城以西湾庙集、岗里店一带三十里的地区内，抓去青壮年即达万余人。蒋匪军捉丁的口号是：“随逃随抓”。抓丁的办法是借口找向导零星抓，或突然包围集市集体抓。二十九日蒋匪突然包围了庙湾、魏店等数集，将集上的青壮年全部抓走，仅魏店集一处，就抓走五百多人。在观音庙、小李庄等村，蒋匪假称召集群众开会，把全村青壮年悉数捉走。二十九日小曹庙农民曹万方娶亲，半路上被蒋匪截住，把曹万方连轿夫吹鼓手一齐绑走。汝南某村现有九个瞎子，都是为逃避蒋匪抓丁，自己把眼睛刺瞎的。各地蒋匪过处，被抓青壮年绳索串连，男女老幼哭喊相随，牵衣顿脚声震四野。汝南城每天有五百以上的被抓家属到城里去寻子找夫，但均被蒋匪打回去不准进城，蒋匪并威胁被抓者说：“哪个开小差，把他全家杀绝”。项城某村一位六十多岁的贾老太太，两个儿子被蒋匪十一师抓走了。她领着两个儿媳向记者诉苦说：“我是讨饭挖菜根，受尽了熬煎，才把大儿子养到十八岁，三十年被那天杀的老蒋抓走了，他爹痛儿得病，又没吃喝，气得饿死了。我忍饥受冻，好容易熬的二孩子长大了，去年才租种别人十来亩地，心想这回可熬到头了，谁知道大年二十九，老蒋的十一师又把二孩子抓走了。”贾老太太把自己两个儿子的名字告诉记者说：“他们不甘心替老蒋卖命，一开火就会投过来的，希望你们留心在俘虏里查一查”。
