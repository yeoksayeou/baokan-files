　　Jinnan Administrative Office Allocates Grain
  　Helping Disaster Area Masses with Production
    [Report from this newspaper] The harvest in Jinnan last year was relatively good in the first and second districts, but the third and fourth districts, especially the fifth district, including Wu’yi, Hengshui, Jingxian, and Fudong counties, only had 30-40% of a normal harvest due to drought and insect plagues. The third district, including Qi Zhi and Feixiang counties, only had 50-60%. The poor masses in these disaster areas either had enough to eat for the autumn, or only enough grain to last until the end of the year, and most faced a spring famine before the wheat harvest. In order to help the poor masses with production, the Administrative Office recently allocated 3.7 million jin of relief grain, which has been distributed to the disaster areas: 1.7 million jin to the fifth district, 1.2 million jin to the third district, and 800,000 jin to the fourth district. They will help the masses solve the difficulties with farm tools and seeds, and engage in sideline occupations and trading. In order to prevent drought and floods this year, they will dig rivers, sink wells, repair bridges, repair roads, and plant trees and forests. In addition, fearing that digging rivers would consume too much of the 3.7 million jin of grain, they have specifically allocated another 2 million jin of grain for digging rivers. In this way, most of the grain can be used to help the masses who have no grain to eat to produce. In the future, digging rivers, repairing roads, and repairing bridges will be combined with "work-for-relief" as much as possible to solve some of the livelihood difficulties of the poor masses. Each worker will receive five jin of millet per day, which is enough to feed themselves and two or three other people.
    In addition, since the Jinnan Daily published an article on March 19 entitled "The Dasi Fort Has Been Flooded for Five or Six Years, and the Masses Demand to Dig Ditches to Smooth the Water Flow," Comrade Liu Zhouguang, Director of the Jinnan Weiyun River Affairs Bureau, wrote a letter saying: In the past, in water management work, emphasis was placed on整治幹流[unable to translate, could be a typo] the main stream, and insufficient attention was paid to drainage work, resulting in years of flooding for the masses. He felt guilty for not being able to resolve it sooner. He also introduced the situation of the harm caused by drainage water in Guantao and Linqing, and the current remediation methods, as follows:
    The drainage water in the Dasi Fort area of the fourth district of Guantao comes from Chetan Village in the sixth district of Guantao. Every summer, rainwater gathers here, flooding eight villages and about 20 qing of land, entering Linqing territory, flooding 36 villages and about 280 qing of land. Last winter, the commissioner's office and the construction departments of Linqing and Guantao counties conducted a survey and proposed remediation suggestions, which were submitted to the Administrative Office for approval. The survey team can set off in a few days.

### 冀南行署拨粮　帮助灾区群众生产

　　冀南行署拨粮
  　帮助灾区群众生产
    【本报消息】去年冀南的年景，除一、二分区稍好外，三、四分区特别是五分区的武邑、衡水、景县、阜东等县，因为天旱又闹虫灾，只三四成年景；三分区的企之、肥乡等县，也只有五六成。这些灾区的贫苦群众，有的闹个秋饱，有的粮食只能吃到年下，大部分闹春荒接不上麦嘴。行署为扶助贫苦群众生产，前些天拨出三百七十万斤救济粮，已发到灾区：五分区发了一百七十万斤，三分区一百二十万斤，四分区八十万斤。要帮助群众解决农具、种籽困难，搞副业做买卖。为着今年不再闹旱灾，闹水灾，就要挖河、打井、修桥、修路、栽树造林。另外怕挖河把这三百七十万斤粮食占去的太多，又专门拨出二百万斤的挖河粮。这样大部分粮食就可救济没粮食吃的群众生产。将来挖河修路、修桥等，尽量结合“以工代赈”，解决贫苦群众部分生活困难，每天每个工五斤小米，除自己吃，还能养住两三口人。
    又自三月十九日冀南日报上登载“大寺堡连淹五六年，群众要求挖沟顺水”一稿后，冀南卫运河务局局长刘宙光同志去信说：过去在治水工作中，强调了整治干流，对沥水工作照顾不够，致使群众连年遭水患。没能及早解除，于心有愧。又把馆陶、临清沥水为害的情形，及目下整治的办法介绍略如下：
    馆陶四区大寺堡一带的沥水，来自馆陶六区车滩村，每年夏天，雨水汇集到这里，淹村八个，淹地二十顷左右，入临清地面，淹村三十六个，淹地约计二百八十顷左右。去年冬季曾会同专署及临、馆二县建设科进行勘验，并提出整治意见，呈报行署批准，测量队不几天就可出发。
