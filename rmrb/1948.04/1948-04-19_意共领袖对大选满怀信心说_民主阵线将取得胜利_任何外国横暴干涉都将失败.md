Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 17th: TASS, Rome, April 14th: The Italian People's Democratic Front held a grand mass meeting of 300,000 people in Milan. Italian Communist leader Togliatti personally attended the meeting and delivered a powerful speech. He said that in recent weeks he had visited all parts of the country, and the People's Democratic Front had never received such unanimous support from the urban and rural working people as it does now. Its broad mass character "exceeded the expectations of any of us." Togliatti severely condemned the election conspiracy played by the reactionary faction headed by the Christian Democratic Party, who, under the slogan of "anti-communism," are opposing the People's Democratic Front, which will inevitably lead to "a repeat of fascist terror methods." When Togliatti talked about the foreign policy program of the People's Democratic Front, he reiterated that Italy must not be involved in any military alliances and agreements that violate the interests of the people, divide the world into hostile camps, and prepare to launch a third world war. Togliatti pointed out that Sforza (Foreign Minister of the Gasperi government, who has joined the Republican Party) had prepared to participate in the Western European bloc, but he has not dared to participate until now because he is afraid of the voters' judgment. Togliatti sharply criticized Gasperi's pro-American policy, denouncing him for imposing "all the principles of American domestic and foreign policy" on Italy, and exposed in detail the political and strategic essence of the Marshall Plan. He said that the recent statement by US Secretary of State Lovett regarding the strategic nature of Sicily can serve as proof. Togliatti condemned Gasperi and his accomplices for not only attempting to conceal the real threats Italy faces from the people, but also for being "accomplices in attempting to drag Italy into war." Togliatti said spiritedly: "Our cause is great, and neither attempts to restore fascism, nor religious terror, nor foreign overbearing interference can defeat us. The Italian people's will to strive for national freedom, independence, peace, and economic revival will surely achieve victory on April 18th."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 14th: News from various sources: The shameless behavior of American imperialism in interfering in the Italian elections has aroused the indignation of the American people. Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, recently received a telegram from the Maritime Union of the American Federation of Industrial Organizations, resolutely opposing American imperialism's interference in the Italian elections, and enthusiastically praised the arduous cause of the Italian People's Democratic Front in defending the working people and fighting for democracy and peace throughout the world. The telegram emphasized: "We support a free and democratic Italy." The Food and Tobacco Workers Union of the American Federation of Industrial Organizations recently sent a letter to the Italian General Confederation of Labor, protesting against the American reactionaries' interference in Italy's internal affairs, saying: "We oppose the Wall Street forces' attack on the democratic rights of the people of Italy or other countries." At the end of last month, when the US House of Representatives debated the so-called "foreign aid" bill, Labor Party Representative Marcantonio listed facts to denounce the American conspiracy of aggression through "aid" to Italy, and exposed that the "generosity" shown by the United States in the upcoming Italian elections was just a propaganda trick.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 17th: TASS, Rome: The one-hour national protest general strike in Italy on the 12th was held in an atmosphere of unity among the working people throughout Italy. Factory workers, civil servants, and transportation and postal and telecommunications workers held short protest meetings. Slogans were posted everywhere on the streets, with pictures of Interior Minister Scelba surrounded by thirty-six crosses, each cross representing a victimized Sicilian trade unionist. Roman police attempted to tear down these slogans, arousing the anger of the working people and the firm protest of the Italian General Confederation of Labor and the leading organs of the People's Democratic Front. As a result, Scelba was forced to declare that he did not know about the Roman police beating people.

　　意共领袖对大选满怀信心说
  　民主阵线将取得胜利
    任何外国横暴干涉都将失败
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社罗马十四日讯：意人民民主阵线在米兰召开三十万人的盛大群众大会，意共领袖托格里亚蒂亲莅会议作有力演说。他说：最近数周中他曾访问全国各地，人民民主阵线从未象现在这样得到城乡劳动人民的一致支持，它之具有如此广泛群众性，“出于我们任何一个人意料之外。”托氏严厉谴责以基督教民主党为首的反动派所玩弄的选举阴谋，他们在“反共”的口号下进行反对人民民主阵线，其结果必然导向“重演法西斯的恐怖方法。”托氏谈到人民民主阵线外交政策纲领时，重申意大利决不能被卷入违反人民利益、分裂世界为敌对阵营，并准备发动第三次世界大战的任何军事性同盟和协定。托氏指出：史佛卓（加斯贝利政府外长，已参加共和党）曾准备参与西欧集团，但因害怕选民的裁判，直到现在还不敢参加。托氏对加斯贝利的亲美方针提出尖锐批评，痛斥他将“美国内外政策的一切原则”强加于意大利头上，并详细的揭穿了马歇尔计划政治与战略的本质。他说：最近美国务卿罗维特关于西西里岛具有战略性的声明，可以为证。托氏谴责加斯贝利及其同党，不但在人民中企图掩盖意大利所受到的真正威胁，而且“他们亦是企图将意大利卷入战争的同谋犯。”托氏精神奋发的说：“我们的事业是伟大的，无论恢复法西斯主义的企图、宗教的恐怖或者外国横暴的干涉，都不能打败我们。意大利人民对于争取国家自由、独立、和平与经济复兴的意志，定将在四月十八日取得胜利。”
    【新华社陕北十四日电】各方讯：美帝干涉意大选的无耻行为，已激起美人民的愤慨。意总工会总书记维特瑞奥近接到美产联海员工会来电，坚决反对美帝干涉意大选，同时热情洋溢地赞扬意人民民主阵线保卫劳动人民，为全世界民主与和平而战斗的艰巨事业。该电着重声明：“我们拥护自由而民主的意大利”。美产联所属食物与烟草业工人工会，日前致函意总工会，抗议美国反动派干涉意国内政称：“我们反对华尔街势力向意大利或其他国家人民之民主权利进攻。”上月底，美众院辩论所谓“援外”法案时，劳工党议员马肯托尼奥列举事实痛斥美国对意“援助”的侵略阴谋，并揭穿了美国在意大利即将来临的大选上所表示的“慷慨态度”只是宣传的伎俩。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利十二日全国一小时抗议总罢工，在全意各地劳动人民团结的气氛中举行。工厂工人、公务员和运输邮电工人纷纷召开简短抗议大会。街头到处贴着标语，上面画有内长谢尔巴，周围绕以卅六个十字，每一个十字代表一位遭害的西西里职工运动者。罗马警察企图撕毁这些标语，激起了劳动人民的愤怒以及意总工会和人民民主阵线领导机关的坚决抗议，结果谢尔巴被迫声明他不知道罗马警察打人的事。
