　　Landlord and Rich Peasant Children Allowed to Attend School

Editor:

　　After reading the articles "Decision of the Northeast Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party on Intellectuals," "Teaching Guidelines for Middle Schools in the Future," and "Instructions Issued by the Border Government on Rectifying Schools at All Levels," we are even more aware that the wholesale purge of landlord and rich peasant students from primary and secondary schools in Wu'an last year was wrong. It failed to recognize that they themselves are young children who have not exploited others, and they were simply purged based on their class background. In some villages in the Eighth District, even the methods of struggling against landlords in the countryside were used to struggle against landlord and rich peasant students, confiscating all their pens, ink, and stationery, and "distributing the fruits" to the children of the masses. The students who were purged from primary and secondary schools have not yet been readmitted, partly because our thinking is not clear enough, and partly because we don't know how to make this turn. Finally, teachers keep asking about this issue, how should we proceed?

　　We believe that the wholesale purge in the past was wrong, but it is not appropriate to carelessly readmit everyone now. It is easy to create antagonism in the minds of the purged students and among the teachers and students, making them think that you were wrong and now you are inviting us back. A mass (student) education and review should be launched to make them realize that it is wrong for their families to exploit people, and that although they themselves did not directly exploit, they grew up eating exploited food. Most of the good and average ones can be admitted to school after such education. If there are individual cases of very bad behavior, those who do not bow their heads, or who oppress children, forming a petty bully style, becoming enemies of the children, and are not approved for admission by everyone, can be temporarily suspended. Wait until after explanation or until they have changed somewhat, and then absorb them. What do you think?

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Chai Renping asks)

Comrade Renping:

　　It is good that you are checking and correcting the deviations in your work, but the spirit of correcting mistakes is still not firm enough. The solution proposed in your letter, we believe, is still a continuation of the past erroneous thinking and, in essence, still somewhat transplants the rural struggle methods, and its implementation will to some extent repeat the past mistakes. The terms "bowing their heads or not," "petty bully," and "enemies of the children" are wrong when applied to young children who have not directly participated in exploitation. Today, we should follow the Border Government's instructions: "Today's so-called national education, in rural areas, is mainly based on the children of peasants, but the children of landlords and rich peasants should also be allowed to attend school. That is, various public schools should not refuse admission across the board." Allowing the children of landlords and rich peasants to attend school does not require such steps to make a turn. Those who have ideological problems should also be strengthened with ideological education and continue to be reformed.

　　地主富农子弟　允许入学念书编辑同志：
    读了报载“中共东北中央局关于知识分子的决定”、“中学今后施教方针”“边府颁发整顿各级学校指示”等文后，我们更认识到去年武安一律清洗高初小的地主富农学生，是不对的，不认为他本身是个没有剥削过人的青年儿童，单纯根据成份好坏清洗下去。八区有个别村庄，甚至搬了乡村斗争地主一套办法，斗争地主富农学生，没收全部笔墨文具，给群众子弟“分了果实”。现高初小被清洗的学生，仍未入学，原因是一方面我们思想还不够明确，另一方面是不知该怎样来转这个弯子，最后不断有教员问及这个问题，该怎样着手？
    我们认为过去一律清洗是不对的，但现在马虎一律收回也不大妥当。容易叫被清洗的学生，在思想上和教员学生对立，认为是你们错了，现在又把我们请了回来。应该展开一个群众（学生）性的教育和审查，叫他们认识他家庭剥削人是不对的，他本身虽没有直接剥削，但也是吃剥削饭长大的。好的一般的都可以经过这样教育后入学，如有个别表现很坏、不低头、或压迫儿童，形成小恶霸作风，成了儿童公敌，大家不批准入学，可暂时停停。待经过解释或待他有所转变时，吸收进来。你们看如何？　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（柴任平问）任平同志：
    你们这样检查纠正工作中的偏向是很好的，但纠正错误的精神仍不够坚决。来信中所提的解决办法，我们认为仍然是过去错误思想的继续，实质上仍有些搬运农村斗争方式，执行起来仍会在某种程度上重复过去的错误。“低头不低头”“小恶霸”“儿童公敌”等说法，用于未直接参加剥削的青年儿童是错误的。今天应遵照边府指示中的：“今天所谓国民教育，在农村来说，主要是以农民子弟为主体，同时地主富农子弟也应允许同样入学。即各种公费学校也不应一律拒收”。允许地主富农子弟入学，用不着再经过这样的步骤来转弯子。其中思想上有毛病的也应是加强思想教育继续改造的方针。　　——编者
