　　[This Newspaper News] The Yuan Dynasty County Committee examined and studied the ideological problems of cadres and the masses in current production, and issued a circular calling for continued efforts to break down ideological obstacles to production and launch a production upsurge. First, the complacency of cadres must be overcome, and then the ideological problems of the masses must be further resolved.

　　After the propaganda week, the spring plowing achieved some results, and the cadres became complacent, thinking that the masses had no ideological problems and that the production movement had already been launched. This is an overestimation. In fact, the masses still have many ideological problems, such as not daring to become rich and maintaining the status quo, which hinder the progress of production. It is wrong to think that seeing the masses plowing the land is the production movement. Because cadres are complacent and have not deeply studied the masses' thoughts, coupled with the village cadres and party members making false reports, saying that the masses have no ideological problems. For example, at the village cadre meeting in Lu Xiaoqu, Houshawo, in the Fourth District, the reports all said that the production movement in their villages had been launched, everyone was plowing the land, and everyone was busy. However, according to the information they have, few of these villages buy fertilizer. When asked why they didn't buy fertilizer, they all said that the peanut harvest was not good last year, and the masses had no money, so they didn't buy fertilizer. They also said that the masses understood the spirit of the Land Law Outline on the policies for all classes, especially the middle peasants, and they also knew that whoever planted it would harvest it, so there were no ideological problems. After questioning them for a while, even they themselves did not fully understand the spirit of the Land Law, so how could the masses understand it? How can they become rich? After mobilizing for a long time, no one told the leadership the truth.

　　A village-wide party member meeting was convened in Houshawo, and again, they did not tell the truth, and again, they reported good news and exaggerated their achievements. After repeated mobilization, a few party members revealed some thoughts. One said: I am a middle peasant, my house is better, although the superiors said that they will not touch the floating wealth of the middle peasants, who knows what will happen when the time comes? Another said: My land is better, I am afraid of being divided, so I don't fertilize it. The third said: I am a middle peasant, my land is better, and my house is better. I am afraid of being raised to the status of rich peasant during the equal distribution, so I dare not produce well. From their reflections, we understand that the masses are afraid of revealing their wealth and dare not become rich. This is still the main ideological obstacle, especially for the middle peasants.

　　Therefore, it is necessary to continue to deeply publicize the policies, especially the policies for the middle peasants, and encourage the masses to increase production and become rich. Explain the prudence of class demarcation, and never raise the status of middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. The floating wealth of the middle peasants will never be touched. Educate party members and village cadres to play an exemplary role in production and overcome the style of being divorced from the masses. As long as this work is carried out in a thorough and meticulous manner, this barrier can be broken. Now Houxiancheng has broken through this barrier, and the masses are buying fertilizer one after another, establishing the idea of increasing production and becoming rich. The ideological problem of the masses is a major problem in the production work of the Yuan Dynasty. If it is not broken, our production plan to guarantee no reduction in income and strive for increased income will be aborted.

　　不受假报告欺骗深入发现问题
  　元朝打破生产障碍
    说明划阶级不叫一人受屈  克服中农怕提高成份思想
    【本报消息】元朝县委会检查研究了当前生产中干部群众的思想问题，特发出通报，号召继续打破生产上的思想障碍，掀起生产热潮。首先提出干部自满情绪必须克服，再深入解除群众思想问题。
    全县经过宣传周，春耕稍有了些成绩，干部就自满起来，认为群众已无思想问题，生产运动已经掀起来了。这是过高的估价。事实上群众还存在着不敢发家致富，维持现状等许多思想问题，阻碍着生产进行。如只见到群众犁耙地就认为是生产运动，是不对的。因干部有自满情绪，没深刻研究群众思想，加以村干党员作假报告，说群众已无思想问题。如四区后沙窝路小区村干会议上，汇报都说自己村的生产运动已经掀起，人人都犁耙地，人人不闲。但据了解他们这些村里很少有买粪的，就问他们为什么都不买粪？他们一致都说去年花生没收好，群众都没有钱，所以不买粪。他们还说，土地法大纲对各阶层特别是中农的政策，群众都懂得了，谁种的谁收也知道了，所以没有思想问题。追问了他们一番，连他们自己也还没全懂土地法精神，群众怎能懂呢？怎能发家致富呢？动员了好久，没一个对领导上说实话的。
    在后沙窝召集了个全村党员大会，又是不说实话，又是报好夸功。经过再三动员，才有几个党员透露了些心思话。一个说：我是中农，我的房好些，上级虽说过不动中农浮财，到时候谁知道怎样呢？另一个说：我的地好些，怕分我的地，我不上粪了。第三个说：我是中农，地好些，房也好些，平分时怕把我提成富农，我不敢好好生产。从他们反映里了解群众思想怕露富名，不敢发家致富，现在还是主要思想障碍，特别是中农。
    为此要继续深入宣传政策，特别对中农政策，鼓动起群众增产发家致富的热情，说明划阶级的慎重，绝不把中农、富裕中农阶层提高，中农浮财坚决不动；教育党员村干在生产中起模范作用，克服脱离群众的作风。这件工作只要深入细密的去作，一定能打开这个关口。现在后现城就打开了这一关，群众纷纷买粪，树立起增产发家致富的思想。群众思想问题，在元朝生产工作上是个主要问题。如不打开，我们的生产计划保证不减收争取增收是会流产的。
