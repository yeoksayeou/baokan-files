　　The Masses of Tongtan Solved Ideological Problems
  　Production Achievements in Five Days Are Not Small
    [Zuoquan News] The masses in Tongtan had the following ideological obstacles, which made them unenthusiastic about production work: (1) Cadres waiting to be dismissed, not daring to boldly lead spring plowing. (2) Middle peasants feared land would be taken away, so they did not collect manure or repair the land. (3) Rich peasants were not preparing to raise seeds, wanting to offer some land or lend it to poor and hired peasants, thinking it would be taken away eventually. (4) Poor and hired peasants were unwilling to deliver manure to bad and distant land, waiting to exchange it for some near and good land. After studying the Administrative Office's spring plowing instructions, the ideological problems of each cadre were tackled first. On the evening of the 18th of last month, an expanded cadre meeting above the mutual aid team level was held to mobilize production. Township Head Wang said: "In the past, I was just doing my job mechanically. Seeing in the newspapers that cadres here were being overthrown and cadres there were being dismissed, I thought, 'I'm in the township government today, but who knows what will happen tomorrow,' so I wasn't at ease in my work." His self-reflection enlightened the cadres present. Wang Hefu, the director of the trade union, said: "The land we cultivate is all more than three miles away, and it's barren land. I wasn't in the mood to cultivate it this spring, waiting for it to be exchanged. Now the manure hasn't been properly collected yet! After hearing in the report that whoever cultivates will harvest, we realized that even if the land is exchanged, we can only cultivate it next year, so we gave up hope." Shen Zizhen (a middle peasant), the education committee member, said: "Hearing that many cadres in various places have been dismissed, we were worried and afraid of making mistakes, not daring to do anything, settling accounts every day, preparing to hand over our work in the future. Now we realize that true gold is not afraid of fire. As long as we serve the masses well, the masses have eyes!" The next evening, mass meetings were held in each brigade, and the instructions that whoever cultivates will harvest were read out, and everyone was reassured. Nine spring plowing production leading committee members and four women's committee members were elected, and production enthusiasm in each brigade was very high. The following achievements were made in five days: most of the grinding was completed, all the land has been harrowed, fifty mu and two fen of cotton land has been plowed, manure has been delivered to two hundred and forty-five mu, seventy-two jin of yarn has been spun, and fifty-two zhang of cloth have been woven. A work plan for the next ten days has also been drawn up: taking advantage of the damp soil, the whole town will be mobilized to block roads and repair roads by team, in order to deliver manure, and to continue to complete the plan for each household to plant and keep alive one timber tree. In addition, production officers from each brigade are responsible for regulating seeds, etc. (Tongtan Communications Group)

　　桐滩群众解决了思想问题
  　五天生产成绩不小
    【左权消息】桐滩群众有以下几种思想障碍，使生产工作不起劲：（一）干部等下台，不大胆领导春耕。（二）中农怕往出抽地，粪也不闹，地也不修。（三）富农不准备养种啦，想往出献些地或借给贫雇种，认为终久是往出拿。（四）贫雇种的坏地远地都不想往那地送粪，等着换些近地和好地。后经研究了行署春耕指示，先突破每个干部的思想。上月十八日晚召开互助大队干部以上的扩干会议，动员生产。王镇长说：“过去我是当一天和尚撞一天钟，从报上看到这里干部垮了台，那里干部被撤职了；自己就想今天在镇公所，明天不知怎样呀，所以工作不安心。”经他反省启发了在场干部。工会主任王何福说：“咱种的地都在三里以外，还是些狼不吃地，今春就没心思种，等换哩，现在粪还没乱（整理）够！听了报上说谁种谁收，咱才认识到给换地，也是到了明年才能种了哩，这才没指望了。”教育委员申子珍（中农）说：“听说各地干部下台不少，咱就耽这心，光怕做下错，啥也不敢干啦，每天结帐，准备将来办交代。现在才认识到真金不怕火烧，只要咱好好给群众办事，群众是长的眼哩！”第二天晚上各大队召开群众会，念了谁种谁收的指示，大家都安了心；又选出了九个春耕生产领导委员，四个妇女委员，各大队的生产情绪都很高涨。五天得出以下成绩：碾磨大部推捣完，地已全部耢完，耕棉花地五十亩零二分，送粪二百四十五亩，纺纱七十二斤，织布五十二丈。并订出了后十天工作计划：趁地湿全镇全体出动断道，按队修路，以便送粪，继续完成每户植活一株木料树的计划。另外，各大队生产干事负责给调剂种籽等。（桐滩通讯组）
