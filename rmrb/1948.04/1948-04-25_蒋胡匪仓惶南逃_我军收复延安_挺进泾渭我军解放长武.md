　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd Urgent Telegram: The heroic Northwest People's Liberation Army has recovered Yan'an.

　　The Kuomintang bandit army's reorganized 17th Division, trapped in Yan'an, under the shock of the People's Liberation Army's increasingly expanding powerful spring offensive, completely abandoned the city in panic and fled south on the morning of the 21st. Our besieging troops are taking advantage of the victory to pursue and attack. The Yan'an Prefectural Commissioner's Office of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have moved into Yan'an City today to work.

　　Yan'an was voluntarily evacuated by our army on March 19th of last year. After one year, one month, and three days, it has returned to the hands of the people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 23rd: On the fifth day of the People's Liberation Army's advance into the vast area between the Jing and Wei rivers in the Kuomintang-controlled area, at 2:00 AM on the 21st, the defending enemy's pseudo-police brigade and other units in Changwu County (40 kilometers northwest of the county seat), at the junction of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, were completely annihilated. Our army has now completely controlled over 120 kilometers of the southern section of the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway between Changwu and the suburbs of Qian County. In addition, at 9:00 AM on the 19th, a unit of our army destroyed four Kuomintang bandit trucks driving east from Qian County, eight kilometers east of Qian County.
