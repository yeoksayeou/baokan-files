How Xin Village in Huguan County Conducted the Party Rectification and Democratic Movement?
    I. Joint Party Rectification and Review of Party Members
    After the first joint branch meeting of Party members and non-Party members, the 14 Party members who performed better had already joined the Poor Peasants' League. The remaining 16 members were reviewed in conjunction with the election of the second batch of representatives. Because the masses had a better understanding of the previous stage of Party rectification and the Party members were more consciously aware, the struggle against the non-Party thinking of the Party members was very serious and conscientious. Party member Li Tiancang, in his self-criticism, reflected on being tricked by the landlord's "beauty trap," protecting a landlord in the South Street from being struggled against, planning for the landlord, forcing poor peasants to perform corvée labor, embezzling 700 yuan, and oppressing poor peasants. He said: "In the past, I oppressed the poor with the landlords and did not work for the poor. From now on, I will break contact with the landlords and work for the poor..." A representative of the poor peasants said: "Originally, we all thought you were using the landlord's money to protect the landlord from being struggled against. Now, based on the facts, we believe that you mainly protected the landlord because of corruption, and you must conduct a deep self-criticism..." The masses were very serious and neither added nor subtracted a point, allowing him to pass and be absorbed into the Poor Peasants' League. Party member Wang Renqun, in his self-criticism, was deemed to have been perfunctory, consistently dissatisfied with the Party after infiltrating it, and the masses refused to allow him to pass. Poor peasant representative Wang Roujin said: "You are not satisfied with the Outline Land Law. You ground wheat on a large mill after the New Year and ate noodles at home. When I asked you, you still talked about the Outline Land Law, saying, 'Let's eat it for two days, who are we saving it for!' What were you thinking?" Renqun had no answer. He was previously the head of the divination group in the East Street of Xin Village and also the deputy of the puppet maintenance association. After the maintenance association was abolished in 1942, his child ran to the Jin-Sui army. Party member Wang Jiaoze had been embezzling, wastefully spending money in the people-run cooperative (which was started with the fruits of the masses' labor), smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, and losing more than 600,000 yuan. When he made a self-criticism, poor peasant representative Zhang Baoxing said: "We are rectifying the Party to rely on the Party. Dare we rely on a Party member like you?" He was not allowed to pass.

    The results of the second joint review by the two batches of representatives and Party members showed that eight Party members who had made good self-criticisms were allowed to pass and were absorbed into the Poor Peasants' League and the Peasants' Association. Eight Party members who had not made good self-criticisms and those who were truly bad were isolated and allowed to continue their self-criticisms.
  　II. Officially Established the Poor Peasants' League, Posted Public Notices to Finalize Cases, and Resolved Covenants
    After the Party members were rectified and reviewed by the joint branch meetings of Party and non-Party members, 21 comrades had already joined the Poor Peasants' League and were generally supported by the masses. The whole village then formally began to prepare for the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League and elected Poor Peasants' League committee members. In advance, each street conducted repeated ideological preparations, wanting to elect people who were not selfish, who were enthusiastic about serving everyone, who did not engage in sectarianism, who did not retaliate, and who actively struggled against landlords to be their agents. Wang Changsong said: "I want to elect Party members Changzhu and Erhong as committee members. As long as they reform well, they can work for us poor people..." Li Yuanchun also said: "Party member Qin Chenbao is a straightforward person who can seek benefits for everyone..." They discussed and elected their own candidates. However, some of the masses were afraid that Party members would retaliate if they were elected as committee members.

    On March 18th, a general meeting of Poor Peasants' League members was held in the village to elect committee members. Before the election, Qin Chenbao expressed his attitude to everyone, explaining that "although he is a Communist Party member, he has not worked for everyone, and he is determined to correct this in the future and be a good hired hand for the people..." Female Party member Wang Genmao also said: "If I did something wrong in the past, everyone will not believe me even if I say it well. Watch me in the future. If I don't correct it, expel me from the Party..." Miao Erhong (Party member) also frankly criticized her past unwillingness to be a cadre, irresponsibility in her work, and desire to be a "nice guy." In the future, she would work actively. As a result of the election attended by 183 people, Qin Chenbao, Yan Xiaoren (female), and 19 others were elected as Poor Peasants' League committee members. Five Party members were elected, and Qin Chenbao (Party member) was elected as the chairman of the Poor Peasants' Committee with a large majority of 140 votes.

    After reorganizing the leadership group of the Poor Peasants' League, all the poor and hired peasants were mobilized. All the poor and hired peasants in the village were involved in the campaign of posting public notices to finalize cases. Class background and history were compared, and most of the poor and hired peasants were absorbed. Individual bad ones were not allowed to participate for the time being. When the South Street was posting public notices, there was a great deal of controversy in the village when Chengxi's wife and Changsong's wife joined the Poor Peasants' League. Although Chengxi and Changsong were poor peasants, and from worker backgrounds, Chengxi's wife's family was a wealthy middle peasant, and Changsong's wife's family was a middle peasant. Although they married two poor hired peasants, they were still "keeping the pig close to the sty," still living their original lives. As a result of the dispute, their men joined the Poor Peasants' League, but the two women were not allowed to join.

    After the public notices were posted and reviewed, the cases were re-examined and finalized. All those who were on the list considered it a supreme honor. A total of 258 Poor Peasants' League members were registered and finalized (121 men and 137 women), including 66 young people (37 men and 29 women). Their own discipline was also stipulated.
  　III. United with Middle Peasants to Organize the Peasants' Association
    The Poor Peasants' League was divided into groups, and the Peasants' Association was established in conjunction with the middle peasants. The Peasants' Association directly elected representatives to form the Peasants' Representative Conference. The presidium of the Peasants' Representative Conference was also the committee member of the Peasants' Association. The representatives of the Peasants' Representative Conference were also the group leaders of the Peasants' Association. Such an election highly promoted democracy, and more than 80% of the people, except for a few landlords and rich peasants, participated in this democratic movement.

    First, the Poor Peasants' League Committee initiated the organization of the new Peasants' Association, uniting the middle peasants, expanding the peasant ranks, and mobilizing the middle peasants by dividing the Poor Peasants' League members into groups. When organizing the Poor Peasants' League, attention was paid to stabilizing the emotions of the middle peasants. Symposiums were held for middle and poor peasants to explain the middle peasant policy, explaining that the middle peasants would not be touched and could concentrate on production. Some middle peasants sent manure to plow the land, but some were afraid and their emotions fluctuated. For example, Zhang Chenze in South Street sold his eight shares of twine and bottom after the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, sewed a new quilt with three layers, and ate a meal of white flour at home every day. The livestock stood there without sending manure. In order to overcome their emotional fluctuations, the poor and hired peasant groups held a symposium with the middle peasants to discuss their thoughts. Zhang Changzhu found Zhang Chenze and said: "You started with selling malt sugar for seven cents. Everyone knows that you worked hard. What are you afraid of?" Chenze said: "I'm just scared at home. I thought I wouldn't dare to sell the donkey, and I wouldn't dare to sell the goods...!"

    The poor peasants united with the middle peasants, and groups of 11 to 15 people were freely formed, and representatives were directly elected. After five days of repeated deliberations (March 30th - April 3rd), 543 people in the village joined the Peasants' Association, electing 53 representatives, including 7 middle peasants, 44 poor peasants, and 2 new middle peasants (25 men and 28 women). In order to consolidate the united middle peasants and absorb the opinions of the middle peasants, 14 middle peasant representatives were added after the representatives were elected. They were nominated by the Peasants' Association groups in the village. Currently, there are 68 representatives, 20 middle peasants, 3 new middle peasants, and 45 poor peasants, including 11 Party members, 34 men, and 34 women, forming the new Peasants' Association.
  　IV. Established a New Branch and the Whole Village Discussed the New Branch Committee
    Party members who had passed the rectification and review all joined the Poor Peasants' League Peasants' Association, and five Party members were elected as members of the Poor Peasants' Committee and served as chairmen. At the same time, in mobilizing the middle peasants, 11 were elected as representatives to the Peasants' Association due to the active work of Party members. In order to give play to the leadership role of the Party, a new branch was formed, breaking the mystery of the past branch organization. Everyone in the village discussed the branch committee, which was passed by the Party members. It was agreed that Qin Chenbao should serve as the secretary of the branch, Miao Erhong should be in charge of branch organization, Zhang Changzhu should be in charge of branch propaganda, and Wang Genmao should be in charge of branch women's work. A new branch committee was elected.

    After the new branch was established, many people asked to join the Party, especially young men and women who were evaluating the conditions together to see who could join. Youth member Hui Shanshui said: "We must become a member of the Mao Zedong Youth League." Hei Hai said: "This time we must find a way to join the Communist Party." Xiao Ren more actively proposed to the Party to accept her into the Party. The prestige of the Party increased, and the atmosphere of striving to join the Party spread throughout the village.
  　V. Elected the Peasants' Representative Conference and Appointed the Village Government
    There were differences of opinion between the work team and the Poor Peasants' Committee on this election method. Some advocated that the presidium of the Peasants' Representative Conference and the members of the village government should be directly elected by the villagers to fully promote democracy. Others advocated that the presidium of the Peasants' Representative Conference should be elected by the village, and the members of the village government should be appointed by the Peasants' Representative Conference because all power was in the Peasants' Representative Conference, which would facilitate the removal, education, and management of individual bad cadres in the future. The two opinions were debated. The former opinion said: As long as all the power is in the Peasants' Representative Conference, the presidium can be elected by the Peasants' Association representatives, why elect the whole village? The latter opinion thought that it was unnecessary to elect the members of the village government in the whole village. Finally, according to the situation in this village, the presidium was directly elected by the whole village, and the Peasants' Representative Conference was established, which had a profound impact on the masses. At the same time, the presidium is the executive body that exercises power regularly. Through popular elections, the members of the village government were discussed and appointed by the Peasants' Representative Conference, which facilitated future supervision of the cadres, and the cadres did not dare to oppress the masses.

    The establishment of the Peasants' Representative Conference and the election of the presidium was a major event in Xin Village and the first time that the masses had truly democratized themselves. On April 3rd, they gathered solemnly in one place with very cautious hearts for free elections. Before the election, the candidates (17 people) made free election speeches. Yan Xiaoren (female) said: "Today, we are holding a democratic meeting. In the past, we didn't have this right. Today, we have the status and the right to speak. I am willing to follow the Party and help our old peasants to stand up and lead women to stand up..." Miao Erhong (young Party member) said: "I didn't stand with everyone in the past. In the future, I will be a good hired hand for the masses and will never engage in sectarianism." She called on young people to be the "locomotives" in this movement and to take the lead in production. Zhang Shuangfu (middle peasant) said: "The middle and poor peasants are one family. Our middle peasants must help the poor hired peasants to stand up. I will definitely be a good hired hand for everyone..." During the election, they naturally gathered in groups of three or five, men and women, to plan the 11 members of the presidium they wanted to elect. They were very serious when electing.

    439 people participated in the election and carefully elected 11 people, including 5 Party members, 7 men and 4 women, 3 new middle peasants, and 8 poor peasants. Branch Secretary Qin Chenbao was elected as the chairman of the presidium with 428 votes. This high degree of democracy was the first time in Xin Village.

    The Peasants' Representative Conference has committees for women, youth, and armed forces, specifically to lead the work of women, youth, and armed forces.
  　VI. The Peasants' Representative Conference Reviewed and Identified Party Members and Announced Disciplinary Actions
    The Peasants' Representative Conference reviewed and identified Party members. The Party members who had passed the review were deemed to have made profound self-criticisms, and it was agreed that they would no longer "pass the test." The main focus was on their future performance. Party members who had not passed the review were selected based on the reasons why they had not passed and passed at the Peasants' Representative Conference. The representatives were very serious and cautious about the mistakes of each Party member. As a result of the review and identification, two people were given the disciplinary action of probation within the Party for one year, one person was given a warning, and two people were expelled from the Party for protecting landlords and ineffective education.

    The Party rectification ended after more than a month. Each Party member was treated with a cautious attitude of treating illnesses and saving people, especially focusing on ideological reflection, inducing education, and fully promoting democracy. Party members were allowed to argue against different opinions, and they were organized to pass the test again and again. However, in order to learn from past mistakes and avoid future ones, it was combined with the reorganization of the organization, and disciplinary actions were announced against comrades who stubbornly persisted in their mistakes. This Party rectification had a profound impact on the masses in Xin Village. Many people said that problems were not solved by beating and scolding in the past, but this time, without beating or scolding, there was free debate and popular democracy, which corrected many of the Party members' problems. Combined with Party rectification, a new democratic system was established. The Party members also reflected that they had been Party members for many years in the past, but they did not know who they were working for. They thought that Party members were just people who had connections and could handle things. Now they must know who they are working for and plan for the masses.

    The result of the democratic Party rectification not only increased the Party's prestige among the masses, but also showed the unprecedented enthusiasm of the Party members. In the process of reorganizing the mass ranks, Xin Village formed a new branch, and Party members were elected as members of the Peasants' Representative Conference, and some were hired as cadres of the village political committee. They automatically planned their work, led production, and developed Party members, demonstrating the role of Party members in various tasks. After Party rectification, the branch also showed a new look of vitality.

　　壶关辛村是怎样进行整党民主运动的？
    一、联合整党复查党员
    经第一次党与非党员的联合支部大会，党员较好的十四人，都已参加贫农团，余十六人结合选举第二批代表进行复查。因群众有前段整党的觉悟水平与党员的思想自觉，表现对党员的非党思想斗争很严肃认真。党员李天苍在检讨时，反省自己上地主美人计当，包庇南街地主没斗，为地主打算，并强迫贫雇硬去支差，贪污七百元钱，欺压贫雇，并说：“我过去是和地主一起压迫穷人，不为穷人办事：今后要和地主割断联系，要为贫雇办事。……”贫农代表说：“原来我们大家想你是花地主钱，包庇地主没斗。现在根据事实考虑，你主要是因为腐化包庇地主，得深刻检讨。……”群众很认真的不多加一分，也不减少一分，让他通过，吸收参加贫农团。党员王仁群检讨时，因他反省了潦，混进党内后，一贯对党不满，群众不准通过。贫农代表王肉劲说：“你对土地法大纲不满意，今年过年后大磨麦子，在家吃面，我问你，你还说土地法大纲哩，吃他两天吧，给谁省哩！你说说是啥想法？”仁群没言可答。他曾是辛村东街日卦道头，又是维持会村副，四二年取消维持后，他孩子跑向晋绥军里。党员王交则，一直贪污，在民办合作社（是群众果实开的）大肆浪费，一天吸一盒纸烟，赔了六十余万元。他反省时，贫农代表张保兴说：“我们整好党是为了依靠党，象你这样的党员，我们敢不敢依靠呢？”不准通过。
    第二次两批代表和党员联合复查的结果，对反省好的八个党员准许通过，并吸收参加贫农团和农会。孤立出八个反省不好的和实在恶劣的党员，并让他们继续反省。
  　二、正式成立贫农团，登榜定案决议公约
    党员经过党与非党的支部大会整顿复查，已有二十一个同志参加了贫农团，一般都还为群众拥护，全村即正式酝酿成立贫农团，选举贫农团委员。事先各街进行了反复的思想酝酿，要选不自私自利的、热心给大家办事、不闹宗派、不报复、积极向地主斗争的人，做自己的办事人。王常松说：“我要选党员长柱、二红当委员，只要他改造好，能给咱穷人办事……。”李元春也说：“党员秦辰保是个直心眼，能为大家谋利益……”。纷纷议论选举自己的候选人。但也有个别的群众怕党员当选委员报复。
    在三月十八日全村召开贫农团员大会，推选委员。选举前，秦辰保向大家表示了态度，说明“自己虽是共产党员，但没为大家办事，决心今后改正，为人民当个好长工……”。女党员王根毛也说：“过去做错，再说好大家也不相信，今后看，不改正开除我的党籍。……”苗二红（党员）也直爽的检讨过去不愿当干部，工作不负责，想当老好人，今后要积极工作。一百八十三人参加选举的结果，秦辰保、阎小仁（女）等二十一人当选为贫农委员，五个党员当选，秦辰保（党员）并以一百四十票的大多数当选贫农委员会主席。
    整编好贫农团的领导集团后，即发动全部贫雇团，全村贫雇卷入了登榜定案运动，在登榜定案中，比阶级、比历史，吸收大部贫雇参加，个别不好的暂且不让参加。南街登榜时，成喜媳妇和常松媳妇参加贫农团时，全村争执很大，成喜和常松虽系贫农，出身工人，但成喜媳妇家是富裕中农，常松媳妇家是中农。虽和两个贫雇结婚，但都是“打猪不离圈”，依然是过原来生活。争执结果，她们男人参加了贫农团，没让她俩参加。
    经过登榜审查，再进行复榜定案，凡是上榜的都认为是无尚光荣，总计登榜定案的贫农团员二百五十八人（男一百二十一、女一百三十七），青年六十六人（男三十七人、女二十九人）。并规定自己的纪律。
  　三、联合中农组织农会
    以贫农团划分小组，联合中农成立农会，由农会直接选派代表组成农代会，农代会主席团也是农会委员会委员，农代会的代表也是农会小组长。这样选举，高度发扬了民主，除少数地主富农外，百分之八十以上的人都参加了这一民主运动。
    首由贫农团委员会发起组织新农会，团结中农，扩大农民队伍，并以贫农团员划分小组进行发动中农，在组织贫农团时，注意了稳定中农情绪，召开中贫农座谈会，讲解中农政策，说明不动中农，安心生产，已有一部中农送肥耙地，但也有一部害怕，情绪动荡。如南街张成则从土地法大纲公布后，卖了自己的八股绳货底，缝了一条三表新被子，每天在家吃一顿白面，牲口站着不送肥。为克服他们的荡动情绪，以贫雇小组联合中农座谈心思。张长柱找见张成则说：“你是七个钱卖麻糖起家的，谁不知道，你是劳动起来的，你怕甚。”成则说：“我在家光害怕，我想着不敢卖驴，该不敢卖货哩………！”
    以贫农联合中农，以十一人至十五人自由组成小组，直接选出代表，经过五天（三月三十日——四月三日）反复酝酿，全村五百四十三人参加了农会，选出五十三个代表，其中七个是中农，四十四个是贫农，两个新中农（男二十五人、女二十八人）。为巩固地联合中农，吸收中农意见，已选代表后，再增添十四个中农代表。由全村农会小组推选，现共六十八名代表，中农二十人，新中农三人，贫农四十五人，其中党员十一人，男三十四人，女三十四人，组成了新的农会。
  　四、成立新支部全村人酝酿新支委
    党员经过整顿复查，通过的全部参加贫农团农会，并有五个党员当选贫农委员会委员，并担任主席。同时在发动中农中，由于党员的积极工作，有十一个当选为农会代表。为发挥党的领导作用，特组成新的支部，打破过去支部组织的神秘化，全村人人舆论支委，由党员选举通过，都同意秦辰保担任支书，苗二红任支部组织，张长柱任支部宣传，王根毛任支部妇委，选举出了新支委。
    新的支部成立后，很多人纷纷要求入党，特别是青年男女在一块评条件，看谁能加入，青年会山说：“咱总得当个毛泽东青年团员。”黑孩说：“这会总要找着参加共产党。”小仁更积极向党提出，让接收她入党。党的威信提高，争取入党的空气流遍全村。
  　五、选举农代会委派村政府
    这种选举方法，工作组和贫委会意见分歧，有的主张农代会的主席团和村政府委员要全村群众直接投票选举，充分发扬民主，都要直接选出。有的主张农代会的主席团全村选，村政府的委员由农代会委派，因为一切权力在农代会，便于今后对个别坏干部的撤换、教育、管理。两个意见争执起来，前种意见说：只要一切权力在农代会，主席团可以农会代表选，何必全村选？后者意见以为村政府委员全村选太不需要。最后依据这个村情况，全村直接选举主席团，成立农代会，对群众影响深刻。同时主席团是经常掌权的执行机关，通过民选，村政府委员由农代会讨论委派，便利今后对干部的监督，干部也不敢欺压群众。
    成立农代会选举主席团，这是辛村一件大事，也是真正群众自己民主的第一次。在四月三日，都以很慎重的心情齐集一场，自由选举，选前候选人（十七名）做了自由竞选。阎小仁（女）说：“今天咱开的是民主会，过去咱没这个权利今天有了地位有了发言权，我愿意跟上党走，帮助咱老农民翻身，领导妇女翻身。……”苗二红（青年党员）说：“我过去没和大家站在一块，今后要为群众当个好长工，决不闹宗派。”号召青年，在这次运动中要当火车头，在生产中起带头作用。张双福（中农）说：“中贫农是一家人，咱中农要好好帮助贫雇翻身，我一定给大家当个好长工，………”在选举时很自然的三五成群，男男女女打算自己要选的十一个主席团，选时非常认真。
    参加选举的四百三十九人，慎重选出十一人，党员五人，男七女四，新中农三，贫农八，支书秦辰保以四百二十八票当选了主席团的主席，这样高度的民主精神在辛村还是第一次。
    农代会中设有妇女、青年、武装等委员，专门领导妇女、青年工作和武装工作。
  　六、农代会审查鉴定党员宣布纪律处分
    农代会审查党员鉴定，已通过的党员，因他们反省深刻，都同意不再“过关”，主要看今后表现；没通过的党员，择自已没通过的问题原因，到农代会上通过。代表对每个党员的错误都很认真慎重。审查鉴定的结果，受留党察看一年处分的二人，受警告处分的一人，二人因包庇地主，教育无效开除党籍。
    整党经过月余时间结束，对每个党员都以慎重的治病救人态度对待，特别是着重了思想反省，诱导教育，充分发扬民主，不同意见允许党员辩诉，一次又一次的组织过关。但也为了惩前毖后，结合了整顿组织，对固执错误的同志宣布纪律处分。这段整党在辛村群众影响很深，很多人说过去打骂没解决问题，这次不打不骂自由辩论，人人民主，把很多党员毛病改正了。结合整党树立了新的民主制度，党员们也都反映：过去当了好几年党员，不知道为谁办事，想着党员就是吃得开，顶门事。现在总得知道为谁办事，要为群众打算。
    民主整党的结果，不但提高了党在群众中的威信，而且党员本身的工作积极性空前的表现出来。辛村在整编群众队伍中组成了新支部，党员们当选了农代会的委员，并有的被聘请为村政委员会的干部，他们自动的计划工作，领导生产，发展党员，在各个工作中表现了党员的作用。支部经整党后也显出生龙活虎的新面貌。
