Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: News: The second batch of Belgian military supplies to aid Chiang, totaling sixty tons, was loaded onto a ship in Belgium on February 6th and departed for Shanghai. The first batch of military supplies to aid Chiang from that country, totaling one hundred and sixty tons, arrived in China last October. Furthermore, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Ottawa on March 19th, the Canadian government announced that military supplies to aid Chiang from that country were worth 1.2 million US dollars last year, all of which were Mosquito aircraft. The Canadian government also stated: "This delivery is based on the agreement concluded in 1946, which stipulates that 60 million US dollars will be loaned to China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government), of which 25 million US dollars must be used to purchase surplus materials." A spokesperson for the Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army stated: Following the United States imperialists, there are now two countries, Canada and Belgium, that are providing military aid to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to carry out civil war. No matter what pretext these imperialists use to supply Chiang Kai-shek with military supplies, their purpose is to help Chiang Kai-shek massacre the Chinese people and maintain his crumbling feudal, traitorous, and reactionary rule, so as to make China a colony of imperialism. However, the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War is certain. This victory is a direct help to the liberation struggles of all countries enslaved by U.S. imperialism and domestic reactionaries, and an important guarantee for world peace. The people of the United States and Canada, and the workers of Singapore, have already begun to take practical actions to oppose the shipment of military supplies to aid the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The spokesperson called on the working class and people of the United States, Canada, and Belgium to launch a mass movement against aiding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

　　总部发言人呼吁美加比三国人民
  　展开反对援蒋群众运动
    指出中国人民战争有利于各国人民
    【新华社陕北七日电】确息：比利时第二批援蒋军火六十吨已于二月六日由比国装船启运上海。该国第一批援蒋军火一百六十吨则于去年十月运到中国。又据法新社渥太华三月十九日电称：加拿大政府宣布，去年一年内该国援蒋军火价值一百二十万美元，均属蚊式飞机。加政府并称：“此项运交，乃根据一九四六年所缔结之协定，该协定规定以六千万美元贷予中国（按指蒋匪政府），其中二千五百万元须用于购买剩余物资”。人民解放军总部发言人称：追随美国帝国主义者之后，以军火援助蒋介石匪帮进行内战的国家，现在已有两国，就是加拿大和比利时。这些帝国主义者，不论以何种借口供给蒋介石以军火，其目的都是为了帮助蒋介石屠杀中国人民，维持其摇摇欲坠的封建的、卖国的反动统治，使中国成为帝国主义的殖民地。但是中国人民解放战争的胜利是确定的了，这种胜利对于一切受到美国帝国主义和本国反动派奴役的各国人民的解放斗争是直接的帮助，对于世界和平是重要的保障。美国和加拿大的人民，新加坡的工人，已开始以实际行动反对运送军火援助蒋介石匪帮。发言人呼吁美、加、比三国的工人阶级和人民，展开反对援助蒋介石匪帮的群众运动。
