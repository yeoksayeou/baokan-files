　　Jinan Sixth Special District Office Helps Cultivate Eighty Mu

　　[Jinan News] In the four villages of Shi, Song, Wang, and Wei in Renping Sixth District, there are many people but little land, and a lack of draft cattle. Counting both large and small cattle, each ox is responsible for an average of 62 mu of land. Laborers aged 17 to 55 are responsible for an average of 23 mu each. The masses lacked confidence in spring plowing. Poor peasants said, "What can we do without draft cattle!" Everyone felt there was a shortage of labor and livestock. Comrades from the Special District Office, in addition to their work in the morning, helped the farmers with spring plowing in the afternoon. Except for departures, all the livestock was lent to the masses. Comrade Li Hailin never missed a session, often plowing ahead of others. Deputy Commissioner Tao took the lead in pulling the plow. The three female comrades from the Finance Section also plowed the land and smashed fertilizer. In total, they helped 23 households (8 families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, 15 poor, orphaned and widowed families), plowed 80 mu of land (excluding the livestock that was lent out), and smashed 35 carts of fertilizer. The spring plowing in the four villages was completed before the Qingming Festival. (Bao Yun, Guo Ming)
    [Wu'an News] The Sixth Special District Office pays attention to helping the masses in the village where it is located with spring production. There is more land in this village, and most of the poor and hired peasants do not have livestock. The Special District Office lent the livestock of its own organization to these households for use. Fearing that they would not want to borrow livestock from the organization because they lacked forage, it was decided that the masses could use the livestock, but the organization would still feed them. As a result, more and more people came to borrow. Before the rain, poor peasant Yang Qiutian (who lacked labor) borrowed a mule and plowed 3 mu of land in one day. He said that if it weren't for the Special District Office, it would have been difficult for me to plant cotton this year. The land has been plowed, and the rain has fallen, so I don't have to worry about sowing cotton. Poor peasant Pu Mengdi used the organization's mule to plow the land, and the organization also asked the groom to use a cart to deliver fertilizer to him. Recently, after the rain, the masses have been busy planting cotton, and the Special District Office has taken out the organization's livestock again to help the masses with plowing. (Ru Xiu)

　　冀南六专署助耕八十亩
    【冀南消息】荏平六区史、宋、王、尉四村，人多地少，又缺耕牛，大小牛都算，每牛平均负担六十二亩；十七至五十五岁的劳动力，平均每人负担二十三亩，群众对春耕没有信心。贫农说：“没有耕牛怎么办呀！”一致感到劳畜力缺乏。专署的同志们除上午工作以外，下午一律帮助农民春耕，牲口除出发外，其余都借给群众。李海林同志一次未缺，经常刨到人头里；陶副专员带头拉犁；金融科三个女同志，一样刨地砸粪。总计共帮助了二十三户（抗属八户，贫苦孤寡十五户），刨地八十亩（牲口借出去的除外），砸粪三十五车，四个村的春耕，已于清明节前完成了。（鲍云、郭明）
    【武安消息】六专署注意帮助所在村群众春耕生产。这村土地较多，贫雇户多半没有牲口，专署就将本机关牲口借给这些户使用，恐怕他们没草料不愿到机关借牲口，决定群众使，牲口仍归机关自己喂，这样来借的越多了。在下雨前，贫农杨秋田（没劳力）借骡子犁了一天地共三亩。他说要不是专署，我的地今年就难种上棉花，地也犁了，雨也下了，我撒花也不愁了。贫农普孟的用机关骡子犁地，机关又叫马夫用大车给他送粪。最近下雨以后，群众都忙着种棉花，专署又将机关牲口抽出，帮助群众耕种。（儒修）
