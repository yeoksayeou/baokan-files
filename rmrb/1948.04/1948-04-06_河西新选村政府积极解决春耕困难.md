[Report from this newspaper] The Hexi Village in the Ninth District of Wu'an is paying attention to solving the production difficulties of the masses during the draft and replenishment work. As early as the end of the first lunar month, the cooperative had already sold all 8,000+ jin of oilseed cakes on credit to the masses for fertilizer. 18 poor peasant households received more than 5,000 jin, and 20 middle peasant households received 3,000+ jin. During the intense stage of the replenishment work, in order not to delay the masses from watering their gardens, the New Xuan Village government committee specifically sent a cooperative production committee member to Handan to buy "kelao" (used for watering gardens, as most of the village is gardens and every household needs it) and distribute it to the masses. Recently, when distributing the remaining fruits, 700 jin of millet and 150 jin of corn, apart from a small portion being distributed to three households lacking grain, the elderly, the weak, and poor hired laborers, the rest were distributed to middle peasants who were short of grain and landlords who currently had no grain to eat, so that they could concentrate their efforts on spring plowing. Zhang Wenjing, a middle peasant who had made mistakes, received 70 jin of millet and 18 jin of corn. His wife happily said, "This grain is really helpful. If my man eats a cornbread meal every day, he will have the strength to work. He has twenty or thirty mu of land, how can he cultivate it without food?" Currently, more than 20 middle peasant households who have made mistakes all have grain and land, and their enthusiasm for production is extremely high. After the draft and replenishment work is completed, the Agricultural Committee is discussing the issue of substitute cultivation, and specific substitute cultivation methods for the village will be calculated and released within days in accordance with the new decision.

　　河西新选村政府
  　积极解决春耕困难
    【本报消息】武安九区河西村在抽补工作中注意解决群众生产困难，早在阴历正月底，合作社即将所存籽饼八千余斤全部赊给群众沤肥，计十八户贫农户分到五千余斤，二十户中农分了三千余斤。在填补工作紧张阶段，为了不误群众浇园，新选村政府委员中，特抽出合作生产委员到邯郸买回克捞（浇园用，该村园地多，家家都需要）分给群众。最近分配剩余果实，七百斤谷子，一百五十斤玉茭，除很少一部分分给三户缺粮及老弱贫雇外，其余都分给了缺粮的斗错中农及眼下没了粮食吃的地主，使他们可以集中力量春耕。斗错中农张文精分了七十斤谷，十八斤玉茭，他媳妇高兴地说：“这些粮食可顶个事，咱掌柜的每天吃上窝子捞饭就能出力啦。二三十亩地呢，没吃的怎种得过来。”现二十多户斗错中农，都已有粮有地，生产劲头极大。抽补完毕后，农委会正在讨论代耕问题，日内即可依照新决定计出该村具体代耕办法。
