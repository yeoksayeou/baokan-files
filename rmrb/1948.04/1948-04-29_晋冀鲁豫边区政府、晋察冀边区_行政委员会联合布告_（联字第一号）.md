    Joint Proclamation by the Government of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region and the Administrative Committee of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region
    (Lian Zi No. 1)
    Since the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji regions have been completely integrated, and the division created by the Japanese and puppet regimes has been broken. The exchanges between merchants and the circulation of goods are increasing day by day. However, because the currencies of the two regions are not unified, and the exchange cannot fully meet the needs of merchants, there are still artificial obstacles to commercial circulation, which is inconvenient for merchants in both regions. Now, in order to facilitate merchants and prosper the economy, this government and committee jointly issue the following orders:
    1.  Starting from April 15th of this year, the Ji鈔 issued by the Jinnan Bank and the Bian鈔 issued by the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank will be allowed to circulate mutually in all parts of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. All taxes and public and private funds will be universally accepted in both Ji鈔 and Bian鈔.
    2.  The exchange rate between Jinnan Bank banknotes and Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank banknotes is fixed at 1:10 and will not change in the future. That is, one yuan of Ji鈔 is equivalent to ten yuan of Bian鈔. In any part of the two regions, all taxes and public and private funds will be circulated and paid according to this exchange rate, and no one may change it.
    3.  From now on, the currency of the two regions will be circulated according to the above exchange rate. If any public or private merchants are found to be buying and selling currency, disrupting finance, or monopolizing materials, they will be severely punished.
    It is hoped that our military, civilians, and merchants will all be informed and abide by this!
        This proclamation.
          Chairman of the Government of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region: Yang Xiufeng
                Vice Chairmen: Zhang Youyu, Rong Wusheng
            Chairman of the Administrative Committee of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region: Song Shaowen
        April 15th, Thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China

    晋冀鲁豫边区政府、晋察冀边区
    行政委员会联合布告
    （联字第一号）
    自从石家庄解放以后，晋冀鲁豫与晋察冀两区，已经完全打成一片；日伪造成的分割局面，已经打破。民商来往同货物流通，一天天都在增加着。可是因为两区货币不统一，兑换也不能完全满足民商的需要，使得商业流通，还存在着人为的障碍，两区民商都感到不方便。现在为了便利民商，繁荣经济，本府、会特联合发布下列命令：
    一、从本年四月十五日开始，冀南银行发行的冀钞与晋察冀边区银行发行的边钞，在晋冀鲁豫边区与晋察冀边区的各个地方，都准许互相流通，所有税收及公私款项，冀钞边钞都一律通用。
    二、冀南银行钞票与晋察冀边区银行钞票的比价，固定为一比十，以后不再变动。就是冀钞一元与边钞十元等价，在两区任何地方，所有税收及公私款项，一律按这个比价流通收付，任何人不得改变。
    三、今后两区货币，就按上述比价流通，不论公私民商，如果有买卖货币、捣乱金融、垄断物资的行为，一经查获，决给以严厉处分。
    希我军民商人等一体周知遵照！
        此布
          晋冀鲁豫边区政府主席  杨秀峰
                副主席  张友渔  戎伍胜
            晋察冀边区行政委员会主任委员  宋劭文
        中华民国三十七年  四月  十五日
