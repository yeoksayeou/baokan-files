Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Comprehensive foreign news agency reports: The just strike movement of students from seven universities in Beiping and Tianjin against oppression and hunger is expanding and gaining widespread support. In Beiping: The North China College has joined the strike. Four students from the college were beaten and injured by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents during the strike and have been hospitalized for treatment. More than 400 students from various schools posted slogans on the streets opposing Chiang Kai-shek's order to dissolve the North China Student Federation and various anti-oppression and anti-hunger slogans. They also expressed sympathy for the "meager treatment" of Chiang Kai-shek's military police, pointing out that the police's actions against the students were forced orders. In Tianjin: Following the professors of Tsinghua and Peking University, teaching assistants and lecturers from Nankai and Beiyang Universities began a three-day strike on the 6th, demanding reasonable requests such as continued distribution of two bags of flour per month and salary payments based on the actual price index. Nankai University extended the strike period by three days starting on the 7th to protest the violence of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents who beat and injured Zhu Zuying (transliteration), a female student of the university.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Beiping News: Peking University students have extended the strike period by three days from the 6th, while Yenching University has extended it by one day, to support the reasonable demands of professors and staff of Peking University and Tsinghua University who are striking and boycotting work to fight for continued distribution of flour and increased wages, and to protest the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits who sent more than 40 special agents armed with guns to break into Peking University during the joint strike of the seven universities in Beiping and Tianjin.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: According to foreign news agency reports: On the third day (i.e., the 5th) of the joint anti-oppression strike by the seven universities in Beiping and Tianjin, students from Peking University and Beiping Normal College held rallies and demonstrations on campus. At the meetings, students delivered speeches advocating for the protection of human rights and opposing the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and demanding improved living conditions for professors and students. During the strike, Chiang Kai-shek's police in Beiping fabricated charges and arrested two Peking University students, but under pressure from students in Beiping, they were forced to release them after six hours.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, February 25th: A group of parents of students from various schools in Shanghai initiated the establishment of the "Shanghai Student Parents' Joint Association" in mid-February. By the end of February, more than 100,000 parents had signed up to participate. The association's aims are to improve teachers' salaries, stabilize teachers' lives, reduce the burden on parents, ensure students' academic progress, and to care for principals and help solve school difficulties. Prominent educators such as Zhou Jianren and Chen Bochui are among the directors of the preparatory committee. The association also sent representatives, together with more than 500 primary and secondary school teachers, to petition the bandit city council on the afternoon of February 24th. The next day, more than a thousand primary and secondary school teachers held an anti-hunger "rescue education crisis" demonstration, shouting slogans such as "Teachers want food," and "Increase subsidies for private schools."
