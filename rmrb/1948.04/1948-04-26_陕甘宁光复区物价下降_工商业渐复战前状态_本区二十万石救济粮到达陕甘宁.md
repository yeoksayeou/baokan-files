Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 23rd: Industry and commerce in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are gradually becoming prosperous, and some areas have returned to their pre-war state. Last year, Suide was looted by bandits, and all shops, workshops, and factories were closed or destroyed. After the People's Liberation Army recovered Suide, industrialists and businessmen returned home to rebuild their businesses. However, during the land reform last winter, the "leftist" deviation of confiscating commercial property in the implementation of industrial and commercial policies affected the prosperity of the market. In February, the Suide Municipal Government corrected this deviation, returning the confiscated property to merchants and civilians, and adopted active support measures, exempting this year's business tax. In addition to selling grain at a fair price, the Suide Trading Company also sold cotton at a low price, and the government provided funds to help merchants repair city houses and shops. The market is now becoming increasingly prosperous, with fourteen more stores than in February. The Yihhe market in Suide has returned to the state before the bandit invasion, and the market is booming. After the correction of deviations in Shawan Town, Hengshan County, the number of restaurants and inns has increased to more than forty. Each market now trades forty to fifty stone of grain, compared to only ten to twenty stone last winter, and prices have also fallen, with millet falling by one-sixth per斗. The number of public and private businesses in the Wayaobao market of Zichang County in the Yan'an Prefecture has increased from more than thirty in January to more than ninety. Small-scale private soap making and iron factories have all started production.
Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 23rd: "Families on both sides of the Yellow River," under this slogan, civilians on both sides of the Yellow River are enthusiastically transporting 200,000 stone of relief grain donated by the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region to disaster-stricken people in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia. 50,000 civilians from the Taiyue and Luliang areas have participated in the transportation. There are reception stations along the Luliang grain transportation line, and each station is equipped with oil, salt, charcoal, and straw for civilians to stay overnight, and children boil water at the stations to entertain them. The daily wage for each civilian is one jin and six liang of grain. For every ten jin over sixty jin, an additional four liang of rations will be issued. In one district of Xi County, many families came to transport grain, with men carrying, children carrying on their backs, and women driving livestock to carry the loads. Civilians in the fourth district of Shilou put forward the slogan "No rest" and completed the 26-day task ten days ahead of schedule. The civilians are working hard to carry more and carry faster, so that grain can be delivered to the disaster-stricken people as soon as possible. The Production and Relief Committee of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region on the west bank of the Yellow River has also mobilized a large number of civilians to move grain to the riverbank. More than 4,000 stone of the 7,700 stone of relief grain allocated to the Suide Prefecture has been transported back. Communist Party members in Huangjiachuan Village, Yihhe District, Suide, township instructors in the urban area of Zhenchuan County and Party members and cadres from all over the region took the lead in transporting grain and successfully completed the task.

    陕甘宁光复区物价下降
    工商业渐复战前状态
    本区二十万石救济粮到达陕甘宁
    【新华社西北廿三日电】陕甘宁边区工商业渐趋繁荣，部分地区已恢复战前状态。绥德去年在胡匪劫掠下，商店、作坊、工厂全部倒闭或被捣毁，解放军收复绥德后，工商业者返家重整旧业。但去冬土改时，由于执行工商业政策发生没收商业财物的“左”的偏向，曾影响市面繁荣。二月，绥德市政府进行了纠偏，退还没收之商民财物，同时采取积极扶助办法，豁免今年营业税，绥市贸易公司除平粜粮食外，并低价出售棉花，政府又出资帮助商人修建市房铺面。现市面日趋繁荣，商店已较二月份增加了十四家。绥德义合市已恢复胡匪进犯前情况，市集繁荣。横山县的石湾镇经纠偏后，饭馆客栈已增至四十余家。每集成交粮食四五十石，去冬每集仅一二十石，物价也下降，小米每斗降价六分之一。延属分区子长县瓦窑堡市公私商号由一月份三十余家增至九十余家。民营小型制皂及铁厂均已开工出货。
    【新华社西北二十三日电】“河东河西一家人”，黄河两岸民工在这口号下热烈运送晋冀鲁豫边区捐送陕甘宁灾民的二十万石救济粮，太岳、吕梁两区已有五万民工参加赶运。吕梁运粮线上设有招待站，各站均准备有油、盐、炭、草，以便民工住宿，儿童则在站上烧开水招待。民工每人每日工资为粮食一斤六两。超过六十斤，每多背十斤加发口粮四两。隰县一区不少群众全家都来运粮，男人担，小孩背，女人赶牲口驮。石楼四区民工提出“不休息”口号，二十六天的任务提前十天完成。民工们都努力多背、快背，以求粮食能早日送到灾民手里。河西陕甘宁边区生产救济委员会亦动员大批民工到河边搬粮，拨给绥德分区的七千七百石救济粮现已运回四千多石。绥德义合区黄家川村共产党员及镇川县市区三乡乡指导员和各地党员及干部都亲自带头运粮，胜利完成了任务。
