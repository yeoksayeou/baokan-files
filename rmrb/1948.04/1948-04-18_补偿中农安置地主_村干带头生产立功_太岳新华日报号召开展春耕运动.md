　　Compensate Middle Peasants, Resettle Landlords
　　Village Cadres Take the Lead in Production to Earn Merit
　　*Taiyue Xinhua Daily* Calls for Spring Plowing Campaign

　　[This Newspaper Dispatches] The Taiyue Region has severely harmed the interests of middle peasants, causing widespread unrest among the broad masses of middle peasants and all social strata, which has greatly hindered the current spring plowing production. To this end, the *Taiyue Xinhua Daily* published an editorial calling for production a few days ago, calling for the immediate correction of this serious phenomenon and quickly mobilizing for spring plowing. In many places in Taiyue, fake peasant associations were generally organized last winter. These organizations were controlled and manipulated by bad elements, who acted recklessly and undermined the policy towards middle peasants. According to incomplete statistics from the Yangcheng Spring Plowing Conference, 548 middle peasant households were sealed off, 492 were placed under control, and 54 were wrongly struggled against. In addition, there are many facts such as forcing middle peasants to raise funds and not allowing middle peasants in difficulty to obtain loans. For example, the village cadres of Zhaozhuang Village in Gaoping arbitrarily harmed middle peasants, putting them under control to produce for poor and hired peasants, which in reality was for their own production. The middle peasant Gao Sidui was labeled as the son of a rich peasant and was forcibly controlled in the saltpeter workshop, required to hand over 8,000 yuan to the poor and hired peasant group each month, his son 3,000 yuan, and a lame donkey 3,000 yuan per month. … In this way, middle peasants were panic-stricken and confused, unwilling to produce, but afraid of being accused of "low production enthusiasm," so they just muddled through. Middle peasants in Yanjiap Village, Yangcheng, randomly splashed manure on the ground. In order to correct this serious phenomenon, the editorial emphasized: Although publicity has been carried out in various places, the phenomenon of seriously harming the interests of middle peasants has not been corrected, and the broad masses of middle peasants still do not understand our party's policy towards middle peasants and still have great doubts in their hearts. Compensation must be given to middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against or whose interests were violated last winter and in the past. If it cannot be compensated immediately, necessary food and land for living and production should be immediately provided so that they can start production immediately. The remaining losses can be compensated later when filling in the gaps in the future. If it is indeed used by hired laborers who have already been distributed land, a portion should be drawn from the confiscated landlord's fruits to compensate them. Middle peasants who have been sealed off should be immediately unsealed. Middle peasants who have been placed under control or whose property has been registered should also be immediately canceled. Forcing middle peasants to lend money to hired laborers, forcibly withdrawing middle peasant shares from cooperatives for hired laborers, and forcibly borrowing middle peasant vehicles and livestock for hired laborers to produce should all be returned to the original owners unconditionally. The editorial then emphasized the protection of the political rights of middle peasants, pointing out that the deprivation of civil rights should be immediately restored. Middle peasants have the same rights as poor peasants to join peasant associations, peasant representative conferences, and mutual aid groups, and can participate in leadership. Those who were cleaned out for no reason in the past can be restored through discussion by the organization. The burden of public grain and public funds and conscription must be fair and reasonable. The three principles of equal value, democracy, and voluntariness must be implemented in production mutual assistance. Second, the hired and poor peasants who have not been turned over or not thoroughly turned over are currently facing many difficulties, lacking land, livestock, seeds, and farm tools, and some even lack food, especially in areas that suffered poor harvests and disasters last year. They have been waiting for months to fill in the gaps and share the land, and now they say that it cannot be done immediately, so they are discouraged and lack energy. Now, the hired and poor peasants must know that spring plowing is an urgent matter. If we miss the spring plowing, not only will we have nothing to eat or wear for a year, but the war to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek will also be more difficult. As long as the spring plowing is done well, it will not be too late to fill in the gaps in the autumn. Various production difficulties can be solved by various means as much as possible, such as the land, grain, money, livestock, and farm tools accumulated in various villages, as well as the school land, militia land, village commune land, land cultivated by government cadres, and the shares and dividends of cooperatives opened with the fruits of struggle can be used to solve the difficulties of hired and poor peasants as a priority. In addition, the government can also provide grain loans, work relief, and adjust grain supply. When necessary, it can also be subsidized from the cleanup of corruption and savings of local grain funds. But the most important and fundamental way is to actively and diligently produce, seize opportunities to carry out transportation and production, and solve their own difficulties. Third, for landlords and rich peasants who have been swept out of the house, they should immediately be given the necessary living and production conditions, such as land and food, so that they can work and produce, and they can be absorbed into mutual aid groups to supervise their production (but not force them to engage in collective unpaid labor, which should be stopped and changed immediately). In this way, one can increase social wealth, and the other can transform them through labor. Fourth, some village cadres with poor work styles or other mistakes are afraid of mass struggle and do not lead everyone to produce, nor do they actively produce themselves. Now, with the spirit of admitting and correcting mistakes, they should lead everyone to produce on the one hand and work hard to produce themselves on the other hand. Sitting and talking without taking action is a mistake on top of a mistake and must be corrected.

### 补偿中农安置地主  村干带头生产立功  太岳新华日报号召开展春耕运动

　　补偿中农安置地主
    村干带头生产立功
    太岳新华日报号召开展春耕运动
    【本报消息】太岳区由于严重的损害了中农利益，造成了广大中农及各阶层的动荡不安，使当前春耕生产受到极大障碍。太岳新华日报为此，特于日前发表的动员生产的社论中，号召立即纠正这一严重现象，赶快动员起来春耕。太岳不少地方，去冬普遍组织了假贫农团，这些组织为坏分子把持操纵，胡作乱为，破坏中农政策。据阳城春耕大会上不完全的统计，被封门的中农有五百四十八户，被管制的有四百九十二户，被错斗的有五十四户。另外强制中农集资，不让有困难的中农贷款等事实也很不少。又如高平赵庄村村干，随便损害中农，把中农管制起来给贫雇生产，实际是给他们生产，中农郜四堆，被指为富农之子，硬管制在硝坊规定每月给贫雇小组交洋八千元，其子交三千元，一头拐驴一月交三千元。……这样中农恐慌混乱，不愿生产，但又怕说“生产情绪不高”，只有瞎胡混。阳城延家庄中农，把粪担在地乱泼一气。为纠正这一严重现象，社论着重指出：各地虽经过宣传，但严重损害中农利益的现象并未纠正，广大中农对我党的中农政策仍不了解，心中仍有很大疑虑，应使全体农民了解党的坚决团结中农的政策，对去年冬天以来以及过去被错斗被侵犯的中农，必须给予补偿；如马上补不好，也应立即补以必要的生活和生产的粮食与土地等，使他们马上能够生产。其余损失，可等将来填补时再补。如确实是雇贫已经分用了的，则应在没收地主果实中，抽一部分补偿他们。中农被封门的，现应马上一律开门。中农被管制或登记财产的，也一律立即取消。强迫中农借给雇贫款子，和从合作社中强抽中农股金给雇贫，以及强借中农车辆牲口给雇贫生产等，都应该无条件的退还原主。接着社论并强调保护中农的政治权利，指出：取消公民权的应即刻恢复，中农与贫农一样有加入农会、农代会与互助组权利，并可以参加领导，过去无故清洗的，可通过该组织讨论加以恢复，公粮公款负担及支差，一定要公平合理，生产互助中一定实行等价民主自愿三原则。第二、就是未翻身和未翻透身的雇贫农，当前困难很多，缺地缺牲口没种籽没农具，有的甚至于没吃的，特别在去年歉收和灾荒地区，更加厉害，他们整整等了几个月填补平分，而现在又说马上不能办，于是就泄气没劲干。现在雇贫农民要知道春耕是眼前大事，误了春耕不仅我们一年没吃没穿，就连打倒蒋介石的战争也更困难，只要春耕闹好，秋后填补也不误的。各种的生产困难可用各种办法尽力解决，如各村积存果实中的地、粮款、牲口农具等及村中的学田、民兵田、村公所田、机关干部种地和拿斗争果实开办的合作社的股金红利，都可以尽先解决雇贫农的困难。另外政府还可以贷粮贷款以工贷赈调剂粮食，必要时还可以从清理贪污与节约地方粮款中加以补助，而最重要和最根本的办法，还是积极努力生产，瞅空子担挑运输生产，解决本身困难。第三、对扫地出门的地主富农，现在应立即给他们以必要的生活条件与生产条件，如土地粮食等，使他们能够劳动生产，并且可以将他们吸收到互助组中督促他们生产（但不是强迫他们集体的无代价的劳动，那种办法应即停止与改变）。这样一可以增加社会财富，二可以在劳动中改造他们。第四、是作风不好或犯了其他错误的村干部，害怕群众斗争，也不领导大家生产，自己也不积极生产。现在应以知错改错的精神，一面领导大家生产，一面自己努力生产，坐着说二话，动弹没有劲，这是错上加错的，必须改正。
