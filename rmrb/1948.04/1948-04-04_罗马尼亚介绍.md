　　Introduction to Romania
    Romania is one of the newly emerging people's democratic countries in Southeastern Europe after the war, with an area of over 242,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 15 million. Its oil production ranks fifth in the world, and its grain production ranks first in Europe, excluding the Soviet Union. However, before embarking on the path of new democracy, the right to exploit oil was in the hands of British and American capitalists; more than one-third of the arable land was occupied by landlords and rich peasants. In August 1944, the Soviet army liberated Romania from the Nazi yoke. Subsequently, the Romanian people drove away the American and British reactionary running dogs Andreescu and his cohorts who were entrenched in the government. In March 1945, Groza formed a cabinet. For three years, the Romanian government followed the will of the people, adopted a firm policy of friendship with the Soviet Union, and implemented land reform and economic recovery plans. By June of last year, 80% of the country's land was already in the hands of the working peasants. The main sectors of the national economy have been nationalized, while private enterprises are allowed to develop. In November 1946, general elections were held, and the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Farmers' Front, and the left wing of the National Liberal Party won, occupying 348 of the 414 seats in parliament. Last July, the traitorous elements, the leader of the National Peasant Party, Maniu, and others were purged; in November, the traitorous elements, the head of the National Liberal Party, Tătărescu, and others were purged, and the cabinet was reorganized, making the people's regime more consolidated. At the beginning of this year, King Michael of Romania abdicated. The constitutional monarchy that began in 1923 came to an end, and the People's Republic officially emerged. In late February of this year, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party merged into the Workers' Party, leading the People's Democratic Front.

　　罗马尼亚介绍
    罗马尼亚是战后新兴的东南欧新民主国家之一，面积二十四万二千余方公里，人口约一千五百万。石油产量占世界第五位，谷物产量除苏联以外，占欧洲第一位。但在走上新民主道路前，石油开采权操在英美资本家手里；耕地三分之一以上被地主富农所占有。一九四四年八月苏军从纳粹铁蹄下解放了罗马尼亚。接着罗国人民赶走盘踞在政府中的美英反动走卒安德莱斯哥及其羽党。一九四五年三月由格罗查组阁。三年以来，罗政府遵循民意，采取坚定的对苏友好政策，实行土地改革和经济复兴计划。到去年六月，全国百分之八十土地已握在劳动农民手里。国民经济主要部门已实行国有化，同时允许私人企业发展。一九四六年十一月曾举行大选，结果共产党、社会民主党、农民阵线、国家自由党左派等获胜，在议会四一四席中占了三四八席。去年七月肃清叛国分子国家农民党党魁马尼乌等；十一月清洗叛国分子国家自由党头子塔塔莱斯哥等，内阁改组，人民政权愈形巩固。今年初，罗王米琪尔退位。一九二三年开始的君主立宪政体随之告终，人民共和国正式出现。今年二月下旬，共产党与社会民主党合并为工人党，领导着人民民主阵线。
