Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Paris dispatch: The Spanish Communist Party's "Mundo Obrero" newspaper, published here, carried a declaration by the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party, calling on all Spanish democrats and anti-fascists to unite and defend national independence and sovereignty, freedom, and democracy. The declaration pointed out: Yesterday's Spain, a colony of Hitler, is today becoming a colony of American imperialism. Franco's Spain is now being recognized by international reactionaries as a bridgehead for aggression and anti-democratic plans. The rule of Franco's fascism, supported by American imperialism, has turned Spain into a vast prison and is impoverishing the broad masses of the people. The Spanish people live on their own land as if in exile. The declaration also criticized the shortcomings of the French Communist Party and government policies, mainly the neglect of the growing resistance movement in Spain. The Spanish Communist Party suggested that the leaders of the Republican government draft a program of action to overthrow Francoism and for democratic national elections as the basis for organizing a national democratic front agreement.

　　西共号召民主分子
  　团结保卫国家主权
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】巴黎讯：在此间发行的西共“蒙多·奥布里罗”报，刊载西共中央委员会宣言，号召西班牙一切民主人士和反法西斯分子团结起来，保卫国家独立和主权，自由与民主。宣言指出：昨天是希特勒殖民地的西班牙，今天正在变为美帝国主义的殖民地。佛朗哥西班牙现在又被国际反动派承认为是侵略和反民主计划的桥头堡垒。美帝支持下的佛朗哥法西斯主义的统治，已将西班牙变成广大的监狱，并使广大人民日趋贫困。西班牙人民生活在自己的土地上，却象处在流放之中。宣言并批评了在法国的西共和政府政策的缺点，主要是忽视了西班牙日益壮大的抵抗运动。西共建议共和政府的领袖起草一个为打倒佛朗哥主义及为民主的全国选举的行动纲领，作为组织全国民主阵线协定的基础。
