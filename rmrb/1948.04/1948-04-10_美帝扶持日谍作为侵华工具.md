Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th -- Shanghai dispatch: In order to revive Japanese espionage activities, American imperialism has, through MacArthur Headquarters, ordered the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to establish an intelligence organization called the Research Bureau. The personnel of this bureau are composed of former Japanese army headquarters staff and Japanese demobilized officers. Its actions are directed and funded by the intelligence department of MacArthur Headquarters. The bureau's mission ostensibly appears to be general international reconnaissance and propaganda work, but in reality, it is specifically aimed at China and the Soviet Union. It is understood that the U.S. side has first entrusted the bureau with the following two tasks: First, to send people to infiltrate China, restore all the old relationships of Japanese spy agencies in China, and influence important figures in the Kuomintang to support the U.S. plan for a general amnesty for Japanese war criminals. Second, to publish various anti-Soviet propaganda materials based on materials edited by the U.S. side, widely distribute them in various departments of the Japanese government and trade unions, and establish special groups to carry out anti-Soviet espionage activities.
