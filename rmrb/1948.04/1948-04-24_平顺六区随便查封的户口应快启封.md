　　Unjustly Sealed Household Registrations in the Sixth District of Pingshun Should Be Quickly Unsealed

　　Comrade Editor: We have two difficult problems in our current work, and we don't know how to handle them:

　　1. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, some landlords wasted, damaged, and dispersed their property. The masses rose up and sealed their land and property. The masses stipulated that they would be given food every few days (their own food), intending to resolve the matter when the land was equally distributed. However, now these landlords are receiving food and eating every day, and they are not working hard. The equal distribution will still take a considerable amount of time, so the problem is difficult to solve. In particular, we don't know who should cultivate the sealed land. If we distribute it to poor peasants for cultivation, the land has not yet been equally distributed, and we are afraid of causing ideological confusion among the masses. If we let the landlords cultivate it, they are guilty of violating the Land Law, and the sealed property is no longer under their control. Now it is the spring plowing season, and if this problem is not resolved, the land will be left barren. Our opinion is that they should still be allowed to cultivate the land themselves, and they should be educated to work hard, and whoever cultivates it in the future will harvest it. The property should be inventoried and sealed by representatives elected by the masses, and they should be given food that is lower than the living standard of ordinary farmers, and they should be told to cultivate the land. Is this correct?

　　2. Some landlords who concealed their class status (cadre relatives) pretended to be enlightened in 1946 and offered some of their property. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, they felt that they could not escape this time. The livestock were so hungry that they could barely move, but they were not fed, and the pigs were not taken care of. They wanted to confess. If this problem is not resolved, the spring plowing will also suffer losses. Our answer to the masses is to first feed the livestock of households that do not have livestock, so that the livestock will not starve to death, and the farmers will have livestock to use. When the redistribution comes in the future, it will be formally distributed to the farmers. The problem of the pigs is either to sell them at the market price and deposit the money, or to find a farmer to evaluate the price and distribute them for feeding, and then resolve it later. We don't know if our opinion is correct, please reply. (Yue Peizhong, Yang Zhiqin, Guan Zhenniu, etc., Sixth District Office of Pingshun)

Comrades Yue Peizhong, etc.:

　　The questions you raised should be handled quickly and conscientiously according to the spirit of the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee (see this newspaper on the 21st). We hope that you will carefully study this instruction and resolutely implement it. Like your district, after the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, without the leadership of a work team, without mobilizing and organizing the masses, and without classifying the classes, it is a principled mistake to act rashly and seal household registrations in the name of violating the Land Law. As far as we know, before and after the promulgation of the Outline Land Law in our district, the Central Bureau repeatedly instructed all localities that no action should be taken without the leadership of a work team, which was very firm and very clear. Did your district not receive this instruction? Did the leadership not convey it? If the leadership has not made this kind of communication to you, it is the fault of the leadership and the leadership should be responsible; if the leadership has already made a communication to your district, telling you that no action is allowed, but you do not strictly implement the instructions of the Party and act arbitrarily, what are your intentions? This kind of liberalistic and independent behavior should not occur even after the reorganization of the troops. It is also because you have abandoned the implementation of the instructions of the higher authorities and implemented your own erroneous policies, abandoned leadership, acted as the tail of some people's extreme emotions, and failed to correct the masses' erroneous actions in a timely manner. For example, exaggerating the violation of the Land Law, such as making dumplings and eating noodles, are all "violations," and sealing some people's doors under this pretext has created a serious period of turmoil and anxiety in the countryside. It should be admitted that this has caused no small loss to the Party and the people. And you still have not recognized this serious mistake in your letter. Therefore, the solutions you proposed cannot solve the problem of not wasting land that you are concerned about. The problem really needs to be solved urgently. We don't know if you have reported this situation to your superiors? Have you asked for instructions on how to handle it? Has your leadership given you any instructions? What instructions have they given? If you have not reported to the higher authorities and requested a solution, but only asked the newspaper what to do, we welcome you to discuss the issue, but it is not enough for you to just do this. We hope that you can conduct an ideological review of this issue. According to the spirit of the Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee, your district should immediately and unconditionally unseal the sealed household registrations. The land and property should be returned to them so that they can engage in production. In the future, no one is allowed to act recklessly, and everything should be resolved during the redistribution.

### 平顺六区随便查封的户口应快启封

　　平顺六区随便查封的户口应快启封
    编辑同志：我们在目前工作中有两个疑难问题，不知怎样处理：
    一、土地法大纲下来后，有些地主浪费破坏分散财产，由群众起来把他们的土地财产查封了，群众规定隔几天给他们发一次粮食（他们自己的粮食），打算到平分时解决，可是现在这些地主们天天领着粮食吃，也不好好劳动，平分又还须要等相当长时间，问题就不好解决。特别是查封了的土地不知该叫谁种，分配给贫苦农民种吧，土地还未平分，怕引起群众思想混乱，若叫地主种，他们破坏土地法有罪，财产查封了已不归他管。现在正在春耕，这个问题不解决会把地荒了。我们的意见是土地还让他们自己种，教育他们好好劳动，将来谁种谁收。财产则由群众选出代表，查点封存，给他们低于一般农民生活的粮食，叫他们种地，对不对？
    二、有些化形地主（干属），四六年假装开明献田拿出部分财产。土地法大纲下来后，觉得这次再也逃不过去了，牲口饿的快走不动了也不喂，猪也不管了，要交待出来。这问题不解决，春耕也要受损失，我们答复群众是先叫没牲口户把牲口喂上，这样牲口也不会饿死了，农民也有牲口使了，到将来抽补时再正式分给农民。猪的问题或者按市价卖了把钱存起来，或者找个农民作价分喂上以后解决。我们这意见不知道对不对，请答复。（平顺六区公所岳培忠、杨支勤、关振牛等）岳培忠等同志：
    你们所提问题，应根据中央局给太岳区党委指示（见二十一日本报）精神迅速认真予以处理，希望你们即仔细研究这一指示，坚决予以贯彻。象你区这样，土地法大纲一下来，没有工作团领导，群众未经发动组织，阶级未划，就轻举妄动，以破坏土地法为名，随便查封户口，是一种原则性的错误。据我们知道，土地法大纲在我区公布前后，中央局曾屡次指示各地，没有工作团领导，一律不准动，非常坚决，非常明确。你区是否没有接到这一指示？领导上是否没传达下去？如果领导上没有向你们作过这种传达，那是领导上不对，应由领导上负责；如果领导上已经向你区作过传达，告诉了你们一律不准动，而你们不严格执行党的指示，任意行动，是啥居心？这种自由主义闹独立性的表现，在整编队伍后仍然发生是不应该的。也正是因为你们放弃执行上级的指示，执行了自己的错误政策，放弃领导，作了一部分群众偏激情绪的尾巴，对群众的错误行动，不去进行及时的纠正。如把破坏土地法提得十分严重，如包饺子、吃顿面，都是“破坏”，并借口封了一些人的门，使农村中在一个时期内形成严重的动荡不安现象，应该承认，这已使党与人民受到了不小损失。而你们来信中对这种严重错误还是没有认识的，因之，你们提出的解决办法，还不能解决你们所关心不荒地的问题。问题确乎急须解决，不知你们是否已经将此情形向你们上级作了反映？请示过如何处理没有？你们领导上曾否给过你们指示？给了一些什么指示？如你们没有向上级反映和请求过处理办法，只问报纸如何做才对，我们对你们提出问题来商讨是欢迎的，但你们只是这样做也是不够的。希望你们对此问题能从思想上进行检讨。根据中央局给太岳区党委指示精神，你区对已查封的户口，应立即无条件的启封。土地财产退还他们，以便他们从事生产。今后一律不准乱动，一切留待抽补时解决。
