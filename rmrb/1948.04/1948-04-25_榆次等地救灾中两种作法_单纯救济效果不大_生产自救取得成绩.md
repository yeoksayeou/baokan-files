　　【Taihang News】 In the disaster relief efforts in the border areas of Yuci, Taigu, and Shouyang, there are two approaches, which have resulted in different outcomes. One approach is to neglect organizing the masses for production-based self-salvation, relying solely on a simple relief perspective. This is mainly reflected in the adoption of egalitarian relief methods such as simple "rice handout charity" and "Bao Gong distribution of grain," and even the occurrence of regional and village-level egoism, making false reports, and striving for more relief grain. In investigating the actual situation, they either exaggerate or downplay the problem. In Shouyang's Second District, the first survey found 205 households with no food, while the second survey found only 25 households. Some also infringe on the interests of middle peasants, reducing their enthusiasm for production. They also launched a grain borrowing campaign of 50 *shi* (石, a unit of dry measure), with the method being that the poor and hired peasant groups first discuss and decide on the amount of grain each middle peasant household should borrow. After the decision is made, the middle peasants are called in and asked if they are willing. The middle peasants dare not disagree. In Yuci, mutual aid groups of middle and poor peasants engaged in sideline production. Because they did not grasp the principles of mutual benefit and labor and animal benefit, the middle peasants received 40% of the profits, and the poor and hired peasants received 60%, which aroused dissatisfaction among the middle peasants. The middle peasants reflected, "Now it's the world of the poor and hired peasants, let the middle peasants starve to death, who cares!" These practices directly and indirectly hindered disaster relief and fueled the development of the famine.

The second approach is based on mobilizing the masses for production-based self-salvation, inspiring the masses to recount the suffering caused by natural disasters and enemy calamities, and stimulating their active fighting will for production-based self-salvation. After understanding the masses' ability for production-based self-salvation and social mutual assistance, and after the government providing appropriate and timely relief, an active production movement was launched. Under this approach, great achievements have been made. The masses in the above three counties earned more than 34 million yuan last winter through transportation, and the 3,300 *shi* of relief grain distributed by the government this year were used to organize the masses for production. After the masses in Shouyang realized that the disaster was caused by the enemy and that they could only survive by fighting the enemy, their enthusiasm for self-salvation was greatly enhanced. The masses in villages such as Moumou, under the cover of the troops, extended to Shouyang Station and seized more than 4,000 *jin* of hardware, tiles, and steel wire used on enemy trains, which could be exchanged for more than 40 *shi* of millet, and also grabbed and transported back more than 8,700 *jin* of hay from the Yan Xishan bandit army. The masses in eight villages, including Xiaonao and Yancun, earned 2.39 million yuan by transporting and carrying iron rails. They also developed 20 saltpeter cauldrons, which can earn 400 *jin* of rice per day after deducting all expenses. They are now improving their technology to increase production.

　　榆次等地救灾中两种作法
    单纯救济效果不大  生产自救取得成绩
    【太行消息】榆次、太谷、寿阳边沿生产救灾中，存在有两种做法，因而产生了两样不同结果。一种是忽视组织群众生产自救，单纯的救济观点。主要表现在采用单纯的“放粥恩赐”“包公散粮”等平均主义的救济，甚至发生区村本位，做假报告，争取多发救济粮等现象。在调查实情上，不是扩大，就是缩小。寿阳二区第一次调查有二百零五户当下没吃的，第二次调查只有二十五户。还有的侵犯中农利益，降低了中农的生产情绪。还发动借粮五十石，方式是先由贫雇小组讨论决定每家中农的借粮数，决定后，叫中农来，问他愿意不愿意？中农不同意也不敢说。榆次中贫农互助搞副业生产，由于没有掌握互助互利劳畜两利原则，赚下钱中农分四，贫雇分六，引起了中农不满。中农反映说：“现在是贫雇天下，中农饿死吧，谁管哩！”这些做法都直接间接的妨碍了救灾，并助长了灾荒的发展。
    第二种做法是从发动群众生产自救观点出发，启发群众诉天灾敌祸苦，激发其生产自救的积极斗争意志，展开群众性的想办法生产自救运动。了解了群众生产自救与社会互济能力，政府适当的加以及时救济后，即开展了积极的生产运动，在这种做法下，已取得了巨大成绩。上述三县群众去冬运输已赚到三千四百余万元，政府今年发放的三千三百余石救济粮均用于组织群众生产上。寿阳群众认识了灾荒是敌人造成的，只有向敌斗争才能生存后，自救积极性便大大提高。某某等村群众在部队掩护下，伸到寿阳车站上，夺回敌火车上用的五金瓦，钢丝四千余斤，可换小米四十余石，并抢运回阎匪军草八千七百余斤。下垴、沿村等八村群众运输、抬铁轨，赚洋二百三十九万元。并发展了二十口硝锅，每天除一切开支外，可赚米四百斤，现正改进技术，增加产量。
