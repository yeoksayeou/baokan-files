　　Experiences of the Wencheng Team
  　Mobilizing Women Requires Patience
    [Left Right News] Wencheng Village, in the third district of Zuoquan, did not pay enough attention to mobilizing women in the land reform work. After the leadership conducted an inspection, two people were specifically assigned to mobilize women. Initially, most of the women did not speak up. At that time, the leadership raised the question: what are the reasons why our women dare not speak up? Why did we join the farmers' association? Everyone started to discuss. Li Yutao said: "We are used to relying on men. We are like a teapot filled with dumplings; we have something inside, but we can't pour it out." Guo Xihai said: "We are afraid people will laugh at us when we speak." After exposing these thoughts, they launched a discussion on why women should rely on men and why they dare not speak. What were the reasons? Wang Sannv said: "In the past, we poor peasants were looked down upon by everyone. No one treated us women as individuals, so we dared not speak." Zhai Huanhao said: "My heart beats when I speak, afraid that people will laugh at me. This is because feudal ideas bind us." In this speech, everyone agreed that they were oppressed by feudal landlords in the past and also ruled by village cadres. For example, Li Yinlan, a poor peasant in our village, was struggled against by the masses without any investigation regarding her marriage issue. This time, we must turn ourselves around properly. We have status, so we will no longer be oppressed by feudalism and bad cadres. After six or seven days of mobilizing women, they realized that in leadership, it is necessary to discover their ideological problems and guide them to discuss and solve them at any time. Only in this way can they be elevated. Don't be afraid of trouble when mobilizing women; as long as you are patient, you can mobilize them.

　　温城小组经验
  　发动妇女　必须耐心
    【左权消息】左权三区温城村，在填补工作中对发动妇女工作注意不够，经领导做了检查，抽出两个人专门发动妇女。开始大部妇女都不发言，当时领导提出咱们妇女不敢发言原因是什么？咱们为什么参加农会，大家就酝酿起来了。李玉桃说：“咱们靠惯男人啦，咱是茶壶装扁食，肚里有，嘴里倒不出来。”郭喜孩说：“咱说话光怕人家笑话。”经暴露出她们这些思想后，又展开讨论，咱们妇女为什么要依靠男人？为什么不敢说话？原因都在那里？王三女说：“咱贫农过去谁都看不起咱来，没人当咱们妇女是个人，因此咱说不敢说话。”翟换好说：“咱一说话心就跳，怕人笑话，这是封建思想束缚咱们。”在这个发言当中，一致说过去受封建地主压迫，又受到村干部的统治，如咱村贫农李银兰为婚姻问题，不加调查就组织群众斗争。这一回可得把身翻好哩。咱们有地位，就再不受封建和坏干部压迫咱。经六七天发动妇女的工作，体会到在领导上发现她们的思想问题，随时引导她们讨论解决，这样才能提高她们。发动妇女不要怕麻烦，只要耐心，就能发动起来。
