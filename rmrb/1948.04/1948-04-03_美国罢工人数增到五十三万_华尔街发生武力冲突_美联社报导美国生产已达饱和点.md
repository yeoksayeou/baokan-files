Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: New York dispatch: The wave of strikes in the U.S. continues to surge. According to United Press, as of March 29th, the number of strikers nationwide had increased to 538,200. In addition to the ongoing strikes by miners and meatpacking workers, 1,500 employees and workers at the New York Stock Exchange in the Wall Street banking district went on strike on the 29th demanding wage increases. Striking workers also established picket lines at the entrance of the exchange. The reactionary authorities dispatched military police to suppress the strike on the 30th, encountering resolute resistance from the striking workers, resulting in armed conflict. In addition, workers at the International Harvester factory in Illinois held a 24-hour strike to protest the factory's unjustified dismissal of workers. Repair workers in southern Illinois coal mines also launched their first strike since 1922.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: New York dispatch: The Associated Press's "Weekly Business Report" on the 28th, in reporting that the production of certain U.S. industries had reached saturation point, stated: "Order forms, the mainstay of thousands of factories, have melted away with the winter snow. Consumer demand has been gradually filled, and price adjustments (note: referring to the recent price declines in the U.S.) are a definite indicator of supply exceeding demand." It also stated: "This adjustment (note: referring to price declines) has already returned to and extended to certain businesses, especially in consumer goods such as radios and electric refrigerators." Furthermore, according to a United Press report citing the Department of Agriculture, despite the strike by meatpacking workers, wholesale meat prices have fallen from the high prices the day after the strike began. This revelation also reflects the extent of the so-called meat "surplus."

　　美国罢工人数增到五十三万
  　华尔街发生武力冲突
    美联社报导美国生产已达饱和点
    【新华社陕北一日电】纽约讯：美罢工浪潮继续汹涌，据合众社称：迄三月二十九日止，全国罢工人数已增至五十三万八千二百人。除矿工与肉类包装工人的罢工仍在坚持外，华尔街银行区证券交易所一千五百名雇员与工人，因要求增资而于二十九日罢工。罢工工人并在交易所入口处建立纠察线。反动当局三十日出动军警镇压，遭受罢工工人的坚决反抗，因而发生武力冲突事件。此外，伊利诺斯州国际收割机工厂工人，为抗议厂方无理解雇工人而举行二十四小时罢工。该州南部煤矿修理工人亦进行一九二二年以来的首次罢工。
    【新华社陕北一日电】纽约讯：美联社二十八日的“一周商情”在报导美国某些工业生产已达饱和点时说：“为数千工厂支柱的定货单，已随冬日积雪而俱融，消费者的要求已日渐填满，物价的调整（按：系指美国最近的物价下跌）就是供过于求的确定无疑的指标”。又称：“这种调整（按指物价下跌）已经回到与扩及某些企业，尤其在收音机及电气冰箱等消费品方面更是如此”。又据合众社引农业部消息称：虽有肉类包装工人的罢工，但肉类批发价格已自罢工开始后次日的高价跌落。这一透露也反映了所谓肉类“过剩”的程度。
