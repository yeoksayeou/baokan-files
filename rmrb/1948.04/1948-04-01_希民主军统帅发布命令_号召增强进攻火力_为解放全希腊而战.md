Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. Free Greece Radio broadcast: General Markos, Supreme Commander of the Greek Democratic Army, issued an important order on the 25th, the 127th anniversary of the Greek people's uprising against Turkish enslavement, foreshadowing the liberation of all of Greece. The order is as follows: The Greek people are celebrating this festival while resisting American enslavement. The Greek people inherited the fighting tradition of the heroes of 1821 and are bravely fighting for their freedom and independence. The Democratic Army's great victories in the Peloponnese and Epirus liberated the city of Arta (in southern Epirus) and are fighting in areas a few kilometers from Athens. This series of victories by the Democratic Army is the best answer to Anglo-American imperialism's attempt to destroy the Greek people. The Democratic Army has achieved continuous victories and will liberate all of Greece. Commanders and fighters of the Democratic Army! Members of the People's Resistance Movement! Continue to increase the firepower to strike the enemy!

　　希民主军统帅发布命令
    号召增强进攻火力　为解放全希腊而战
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】自由希腊电台广播：希腊民主军最高统帅马科斯将军，于二十五日希腊人民夺起反抗土耳其奴役一百二十七周年纪念日，发布重要命令，预示将解放希腊全国，命令如下：希腊人民是在抗拒美国奴役的情况下来庆祝这一节日。希腊人民继承了一八二一年英雄们的战斗传统，英勇地为自己自由独立而奋斗。民主军在摩里亚半岛与爱匹鲁斯的大胜，解放了阿尔塔城（在爱匹鲁斯南部），在离雅典几公里的地区进行战斗。民主军这一连串的战绩，就是给予企图毁灭希腊人民的英美帝国主义的一个最好答复。民主军取得了连续胜利，并将解放全希腊。民主军的指战员们！人民抵抗运动的盟员们！继续增强打击敌人的火力！
