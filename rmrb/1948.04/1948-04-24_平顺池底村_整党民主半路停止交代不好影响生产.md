　　Ping Shun Chi Di Village
  　Rectification of the Party and Democracy Stopped Halfway, Poor Explanation Affects Production
    [Ping Shun News] The work team dispatched to Chi Di Village in the Second District of this county to lead the democratic movement, rectification of the Party, and land redistribution, has temporarily suspended the work because spring plowing is imminent and most of the cadres have been transferred to lead production. However, the suspension was not handled well, resulting in two serious problems in the village: One is that the political director (branch secretary) Hu Guang and the finance director Zhang Junhu felt that "it doesn't matter, we can relax now." They began to intimidate the masses with big talk and wanted to dominate the masses again (the masses were most opposed to and had the most opinions about these two in the past). The honest peasants who had expressed opinions about them a few days ago became frightened. Chang Sanhai was allocated land by the cadres during the re-examination last year, but he thought the land was too far away, fearing that he would not be able to harvest anything, and also fearing retaliation from cadres Zhang Junhu and Zhang Niuze. He dared not accept it, and was detained to investigate his thinking. This time, when the work team arrived, he was only able to speak out about this matter with great difficulty. Now that he sees the work team leaving halfway, he is very panicked. Poor peasant Guo Haichen said: "We shouldn't have come! We were tricked by Lao Xu (the work team). Who knows what those cadres will do to us!" These cadres were frightened by a few days of Party rectification. Village chief Zhang Chouhai said: "I don't seek merit, only to avoid mistakes. It's better to say less than more." He adopts a "good old man" attitude and asks the poor and hired peasants about everything, big or small. When collecting the agricultural income tax, he gathered the poor and hired peasants together, kept silent himself, and just let everyone discuss it. It took three days to divide the money, and finally decided to exempt eight poor and hired peasant households. Poor peasant Liu Cun said: "This kind of wasted work is worse than paying the money ourselves. With these three days of work, we could have earned enough by doing odd jobs." Poor peasant Liu Sanfang said anxiously: "The meeting is over, and buying things is delayed." As a result, the spring plowing in Chi Di Village has become sluggish and stagnant. The Qingming Festival is approaching, and most of the manure has not been moved out, and most of the field edge repairs, embankment building, and harrowing have not been done. The comrades who stayed in the village, after several days of visiting the poor and hired peasants and middle peasants, understood this situation. First, they explained the democratic land redistribution policy. On March 25th, a forum was held with middle and poor peasants and cadres to explain the policies of democratic land redistribution and Party rectification, the importance of spring plowing and sowing, and the mistakes of cadres not leading the masses in production. The masses were allowed to discuss and the cadres to reflect. Yin Chang, the vice chairman of the farmers' association, said: "I'm not afraid anymore. I will definitely accept opinions with evidence." Zhang Zikui, the director of the armed committee, said: "If we neglect to lead and delay production, the mistake will be even greater. This is making a mistake on top of a mistake." Poor peasant Guo Shuan said to cadre Yin Chang: "You are a cadre. The masses are reasonable. How could they give you bad advice? What's the point of you lying down and not leading production?" Poor peasant Suo Chuntang said: "Yes, just dividing a few acres of land is useless if we don't produce. We can't eat without grain!" Poor peasant You Gen said: "Whether it's land redistribution or solving cadre problems, if we want to eat, we have to work ourselves and harvest the grain." After two forums, mass discussion, and cadre reflection, and after strict criticism of bad cadres such as Hu Guang and Zhang Junhu, everyone's attention turned back to production. Finally, after discussing the government's announcement that whoever plants the land owns the harvest, everyone's enthusiasm was further increased. A third general meeting of the whole village was held to make specific plans for the current production work (carrying coal, cutting firewood, delivering fertilizer, and repairing land). Liu Cun has cut 20,000 catties of firewood and carried 15,000 catties of coal in a month, earning 370,000 yuan from transportation and accumulating 66,000 loads of fertilizer, all of which have been delivered. He is now repairing field edges and building embankments.

　　平顺池底村
  　整党民主半路停止交代不好影响生产
    【平顺消息】本县分配在二区池底村领导民主、整党与抽补运动的工作组，因为春耕在即，干部大部抽出去领导生产，整党等工作暂时中止。但在中止时没有进行很好的安置，结果村中发生了两种严重问题：一种是政治主任（支书）胡广与财政主任张俊虎，觉得“不要紧啦，可以松松啦”。开始用大话威吓群众，又想统治群众（群众过去对他们两人最反对，意见最多）。前几天对他们提过意见的老实农民，都害怕起来。常三孩在去年复查中干部给他分地时，他嫌地远，怕种上收不了，又怕干部张俊虎、张牛则报复，不敢要，就被扣起来追思想。这次工作组来到，好容易才说出这事，现在一见工作组半路走了，就非常恐慌。贫农郭海辰说：“咱可不该来呀！生生上了老徐（工作组）的当，你知那干部不干咱呢！”这一种干部是叫几天整党吓坏了。村长张丑孩说：“咱不求有功，只求无过，多一言不如少一语”，抱着老好人态度，不管大事小事，都要问问贫雇。征收农业所得税时，把贫雇召集在一起，自己不吭气，只是让大家来讨论，拖了三天才把款分开，最后决定了八户贫雇农免征。贫农刘存说：“这样的误工，不胜咱们把款出上，有这三天工夫，咱就打短工也赚够啦。”贫农刘三方急的说：“会也过啦，买东西也误啦”。这样，池底村的春耕就消沉停顿了，清明节快到了，粪还大部分没有搬出去，修边、垒岸、耙地等也大部没动。留村工作的同志，经过几日访问贫雇与中农，了解了这种情况以后，首先说明民主填补政策。于三月二十五日召开中贫农与干部座谈会，说明民主填补和整党的政策，春耕下种的重要，和干部不领导群众生产的错误，让群众讨论，干部反省。农会副主席银昌说：“我这就不害怕啦，有证有据的意见我一定接受。”武委会主任张子魁说：“咱们要是放下不领导，耽误了生产，错误才更大呢，这是错上加错”。贫农郭拴向干部银昌说：“你当干部呢，群众是讲道理的，还能给你瞎提意见？你躺倒不领导生产算啥？”贫农索春堂说：“是呀，光平分上几亩地，不生产，打不上粮食也不顶事！”贫农有根说：“平分也罢，解决干部问题也罢，要想吃饭，总得自己劳动，打下粮食才行”。经过两次座谈，群众研究，干部反省，又对坏干部胡广、张俊虎等作了严格批评，大家对生产才转过弯来。最后，又把边府谁种谁收的布告讨论以后，大家情绪更提高了。第三次又召开了全村群众大会，把当前的生产工作作了具体计划（驮煤割柴送肥修地）。刘存则一个来月割柴两万斤，驮煤一万五千斤，运输收入洋三十七万元，积肥六万六千担，已全部送出，现在进行修边垒堰。
