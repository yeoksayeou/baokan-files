　　The Table Clock
    Zhang Ming
    Inside the east gate of Luoyang, on the south side of the road, there was a merchant's building. When our troops突進 (tūjìn) into the city, a small number of enemies stubbornly resisted from the building. Finally, the warriors of two assault teams were the first to charge up the building. The enemies had already fled, and the homeowner was so frightened that he didn't know where to hide. The building was quiet, without a single person. Inside the room were beautiful floral quilts, brand-new leather bags, and many clothes. On a square table, there was also a steel-cased pocket watch, with a snow-white face and pitch-black hands. In the lamplight, it looked like it was not yet twelve o'clock, and the tiny second hand was ticking away.
    The warriors searched the building for a while, but after finding no weapons or ammunition, they hurriedly left. After that, many warriors came and went from this building, but the items inside remained untouched.
    After the task of consolidating the breach was completed, the Third Company was ordered to rest in this building. Only that ticking clock attracted the thoughts of some comrades. The Third Platoon Deputy Wang Baohuai said, "Fighting battles requires a clock. I want to take it before the 'Three Checks'." But after saying that, he didn't touch the clock at all. The other comrades also discussed, saying, "Discipline is self-imposed. If anything is missing from the building, our company will be responsible!" While they were discussing this, Deputy Political Instructor Zhuang Jianli arrived. The warriors asked, "Deputy Instructor, do you think this clock is good?" Deputy Instructor Zhuang took out a small knife and pried open the case. A brand-new clockwork, inlaid with four jewels, it was indeed a good Swiss watch. After looking at it, the clock was placed back on the table as it was.
    The troops set off. The deputy instructor checked the discipline. Nothing in the building had been touched. The steel-cased clock was still on the table, ticking away.

　　桌上的表
    张明
    洛阳东城门里，靠路南有座商家的楼房，当我们部队突进城后，少数敌人凭楼顽抗着。最后两个突击队的战士首先冲上了楼，敌人已经逃走了，房主人也吓得不知躲到哪里去了，楼上静悄悄的，一个人也没有。房内放着漂亮的花被，崭新的皮包和许多衣服。在一张方桌上还放着一只钢壳怀表，雪白的表面，漆黑的表针，在灯光下看去还不到十二点钟，细小的秒针正在滴滴答答的走着。
    战士们在楼上搜寻了一会，没有发现武器弹药一类的东西就急忙出去了。之后，这个楼上来来往往的战士很多，楼上的东西仍旧原封不动的摆着。
    巩固突破口的任务完成后，三连被命令停止在这楼上休息。只有那一只滴滴答答的表，吸引了一部分同志的思想，三排副王保怀说：“打仗就是需要表，要在三查前我就要把它装起来了。”但是说了后，却没有动一动那只表。其余的同志也纷纷议论说：“纪律是自觉的，楼上的东西少了，咱连要负责！”正议论时，副政指庄建礼同志来了，战士们问：“副指导员，你看这表好吗？”庄副指导员拿出小刀剥开表壳一看，崭新的表心，镶着四颗宝石，的确是瑞士的好表。看完后，表又原样摆到桌子上。
    部队出发了，副指导员检查纪律，楼上的东西丝毫未动，那只钢壳表依然放在桌上滴滴答答的走着。（按此文作者为战斗英雄，先攻入洛阳城的突击营营长张明）
