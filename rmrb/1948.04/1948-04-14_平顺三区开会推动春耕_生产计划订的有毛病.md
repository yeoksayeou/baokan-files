Pingshun News: The Third District of Pingshun held a joint meeting of main village cadres and honest poor peasant representatives on the 26th of this month. 182 people attended, including 104 cadres and 78 poor peasants. This meeting resolved ideological obstacles for the cadres and reviewed and promoted production. Because the village cadres did not fully understand the spirit of party rectification and democracy, their thinking was confused, and many lay down on the job. For example, Chang Sanlong said, "My own work style is not good. When I see a hired or poor peasant, I feel like a mouse seeing a cat." Zhao Fan then added, "If you want to rectify, do it quickly. Like hanging a camel with a long hair rope, when will it be done?" Many village cadres felt caught in the middle, not knowing how to lead. Zhao Fusheng, the village chief of Houbei Village, said, "I don't dare to boldly lead in production. I can't be too deep, and I can't be too shallow. I don't know if what I'm doing is right or wrong. I have to discuss even issuing a pass with the poor peasants and hired laborers." As a result, no one was in charge of production, and it became laissez-faire.

During the discussion, the village cadres also raised the point: they are not afraid of honest poor peasants and hired laborers, but only afraid of a few dishonest people who are unreasonable. They have been working for a long time, and there are errors, but as long as the problems are sorted out according to size and right and wrong are distinguished, they are willing to reform. Chang Xianyi said, "I am just afraid that dishonest people will use the name of poor peasants and hired laborers to settle personal scores in the name of the public. As long as these people are not allowed to exaggerate the facts, I will be at ease in production."

Then, they reviewed the problems with the old village organizations in the past. Some widowed, orphaned, and vagrant people could not join the groups. Instead of discussing how to handle this through mass discussion, the cadres used administrative orders to forcibly add them to the groups. The so-called "three great combinations" and "this faction and that faction" only existed in name and had no effect, making the masses' thinking very confused, and they were only focused on attending meetings. After discussion, it was believed that this old organization was not suitable for the needs of the masses. It was decided to establish a spring plowing committee, which would be discussed by the masses themselves, to truly elect cadres who have been working for a long time, are upright, not selfish, and actively work for everyone, and to re-establish free organizations and democratically elect group leaders. They also studied the current difficulties in production, which is that 94 households and 249 people in the entire district have nothing to eat, and the spring famine is widespread. The solution is to organize production for self-rescue. Women will weave (without cotton, the cooperative will allocate it). Where there are mulberry trees, silkworms can be raised. Male laborers should try their best to transport goods during the busy spring season, proposing a plan of "one dou of corn for three dou of chaff," planting spring vegetables early. The entire district, consisting of 26 villages, has a loan of 4.2 million yuan, mainly to solve the difficulties of poor peasants and hired laborers in buying livestock, repairing farm tools, and collecting manure from sheep during spring plowing. The district office is actively preparing various seeds for sowing. There are a total of 4,160 women in the district who can spin. Except for those who are giving birth or sick, there are 3,800 left. They discussed a plan of 60 days, with each person spinning four liang (approximately 5 ounces) per day. 3,800 people can spin 950 jin (approximately 1,166 pounds) a day. In 60 days, they plan to spin a total of 57,000 jin (approximately 69,900 pounds) of cotton and weave it all into cloth. Everyone has confidence in completing the plan.

Editor's Note: The Third District of Pingshun reviewed the forced combination and orders of the past mutual aid at this mobilization production meeting, which is good. However, there are still things worth studying in the production plan. For example, how were the spinning numbers determined? How will they be completed? Are there still remnants of the old formalism?

Also, it is okay to convene cadres and poor peasants to mobilize production, but why can't middle peasants participate in such a meeting?

### 平顺三区开会推动春耕　生产计划订的有毛病

　　平顺三区开会推动春耕
  　生产计划订的有毛病
    【平顺消息】平顺三区于本月二十六日召开各村主要干部及老实贫雇代表联席会，到会人数一百八十二人，干部一百零四人，贫雇七十八人，这次会议解决了干部的思想障碍，检查推动了生产。因各村干部对整党民主精神了解不够，思想混乱，不少躺倒，如常三龙说：“自己作风不好，见了雇贫就和老鼠见了猫子一样”。赵帆则接着说：“要整就快些，长毛绳吊骆驼，吊在啥时候？”不少村干感到两头作难，不知道怎样领导。如后北村长赵伏生说：“生产上不敢大胆领导，深不得浅不得，不知做对还是不做对，开个路条也得和贫雇商量商量。”这样生产上没有人管，形成自流。
    村干部在讨论中又提出：不怕老实贫雇，光怕个别不正派分子不说理，咱做工作很长时间，错误是有，只要分问题大小辨清是非就行，咱是愿意改造的。常贤义说：“就是怕不正派分子，借上贫雇字号来以公报私，只要不让这些人给扩大事实，我就在生产上安心了。”
    接着又检讨，过去村上旧一套组织的毛病，有的鳏寡孤独流氓参加不了组，不是通过群众讨论如何办，而是干部行政命令往组里强编。三大结合这股那股，光有名词不起作用，弄的群众思想上很乱，光顾着开会。讨论后，认为这一套旧组织不适合群众的需要，决定成立一个春耕委员会，由群众自己讨论，真正选出长年劳动、为人正派、不自私、为大家积极工作的人当干部，从新结合自由组织，民主选举组队长。又研究当前生产中的困难是全区有九十四户二百四十九口人没吃的，春荒问题普遍存在。解决办法是组织生产自救，妇女纺织（没棉花合作社调剂），有桑树地方可养蚕。男劳力在春忙中尽量抽时运输，提出一斗玉茭三斗糠，早种春菜早接上的办法，全区共二十六个村，贷款四百二十万元，主要解决贫雇农春耕中的买牲口、修理农具、卧羊积肥等困难，区署正积极准备各种种籽预备下种。全区共纺妇四千一百六十个，除生小孩、病人外，剩三千八百人，讨论计划六十天，每人每日订四两，三千八百人，一天可纺九百五十斤，六十天共订纺花五万七千斤，并全部织成布。大家很有信心完成计划。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：平顺三区在这次动员生产会上检讨了过去互助的强编、命令，这是好的。但在生产计划里仍有值得研究的地方。如纺织数字是怎样订的？怎样去完成呢？是否仍有旧的一套形式主义的残余呢？
    再，召开干部贫雇动员生产，这是可以的，中农为什么不可以参加这样的会呢？
