Gaoyi Achieves Initial Successes in Eliminating Wasteland Through Afforestation and Textile Production

[Gaoyi News] A cadre meeting was held in Gaoyi on April 11 to review production. After resolving ideological obstacles among cadres and the masses and addressing spring famine difficulties, some progress has been made in production work over the past month. In terms of eliminating wasteland, according to statistics from 22 villages, there were originally 2,865 mu of wasteland, of which 2,488 mu have now been reclaimed. Some villages have completely eliminated wasteland. For example, Li Village in the Third District had 700 mu of wasteland, which has now been completely reclaimed. The method used was to resettle landlords who were struggled against and those who had fled, allocating them land for their own cultivation, while also organizing households with labor and livestock to carry out reclamation. To complete the elimination of wasteland, some villages have established reward measures. For example, Gangtou Village stipulates that if the income from reclaiming wasteland this year is below the expected grain yield, it will be taxed based on the actual grain yield. Of the village's 791 mu of wasteland, more than 500 mu have now been reclaimed. In terms of tree planting, a survey of 33 villages shows that a total of 24,862 trees have been planted. Zhonghan Village alone planted 3,216 trees, and Zhang Sancai of Caoliu Village planted 186 trees by himself. The textile industry has also become a widespread movement. During this period, the profit from textiles is high: buying 1,000 yuan worth of cotton can generate a profit of 800 yuan when spun into yarn. In markets such as those in the city and Wancheng, 2,500 jin of cloth can be sold per market day. In the Hetou Village, Zhonghan, and Chezhan markets, 800 to 1,000 jin of cloth are sold per market day, all of which are woven within the county. Textile technology has also been generally improved, with the county weaving 1,500 jin of cloth per day. Another relatively serious problem is the spontaneous formation of mutual aid teams without any supervision. Gaoyi's production mutual aid had many problems last year, with a very bad influence on the general public and many unresolved issues. Some villages did not settle accounts throughout the year, resulting in some people suffering losses and others benefiting unfairly. Therefore, when deploying production work this year, it was proposed that we would not emphasize the organization of mutual aid, and that the evaluation of production achievements would not only look at the number of groups organized, but mainly at production achievements. However, due to the resolution of mass ideological problems and spring famine problems, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has increased. We have not seized the enthusiasm of the masses and called for the establishment of mutual aid based on the principle of genuine voluntarism, and cadres do not know how to do it. Some villages had fewer mutual aid problems last year, and the masses still want to organize, but we have not consciously helped them, resulting in a spontaneous organization of production during this period. At the same time, we have not adequately solved some other difficulties in mass production.

After the review, several specific issues were resolved based on the county's situation: First, in order to promote large-scale production and overcome the phenomenon of some village cadres being unable to act and the lack of leadership in production, it was decided that each village would establish a production committee to be specifically responsible for unified leadership of production and to solve difficulties in production. Poor peasant groups in individual villages that have not been established by work teams should be disbanded. Second, mutual aid and labor exchange to solve labor and livestock difficulties must be truly democratic and voluntary, and cannot be forced. As long as the people who save labor are willing, temporary labor exchange is also fine. The land of widowed and childless households without labor must also be cultivated, and cannot be allocated to households with labor for cultivation on their behalf, or forced into mutual aid teams. If some villages allow people with labor to cultivate on behalf of others with the consent of both parties, and the grain is divided between the two parties after deducting burdens, this method can also be adopted. Third, village cadres should be persuaded to lead production well through education and should not wait for subsidies. If mistakes are not corrected and continue to be committed, they can be reported to the county, and land acquired through corruption will not be returned for the time being, but it cannot be left barren. Fourth, during the drought resistance last year, some villages forced the disruption of waterwheels for shared use, moving this household's waterwheel to that household's well. Now, some original owners want to move them back but dare not, and they also dare not repair them for use, fearing that they will not be able to use them themselves and that they will belong to others. Now, the items should all be returned to the original owners, and forced use is prohibited in the future unless agreed upon by the owner. Fifth, some loans this time emphasized specific uses, which restricted some households' access to loans. If you can buy livestock, you can get a loan, but if you use it for other purposes, you can't get a loan even if you are a poor peasant. In the future, regardless of the purpose, as long as it is used for production, it is acceptable.

　　灭荒植树开展纺织　高邑生产初获成绩
    【高邑消息】高邑四月十一日召开干部会，检查生产。经过解决干群思想障碍和春荒困难之后，一个月来的生产工作已获得一些成绩。在消灭荒地上，现据廿二个村统计，原有荒地二八六五亩，现已开出二四八八亩，有些村庄已全部完成了灭荒。如三区里村，原有荒地七百亩，现已全部开出，开的办法是：除安置了被斗户逃亡户、给他们分配土地自己耕种外，同时组织了有劳畜力的户进行开恳。为了完成灭荒，有些村订了奖励办法，如岗头村，规定开熟荒今年收入在应产粮以下的，按实产粮负担，全村七百九十一亩荒地，现已开出五百余亩。在栽树上，据卅三个村调查，共栽树二四八六二棵，中韩一村即栽树三二一六棵，曹留村张三才一人，就栽树一八六棵。在纺织上也普遍的形成了运动，这一时期纺织利润高，买一千元花，纺成线可赚八百元。城内、万城等集上，一集可上布二五○○斤。河头村、中韩、车站等集，每集也上布八百至一千斤，都是本县织的。在纺织技术上也普遍的提高了，全县一天即织布一千五百斤。另外有一个较严重的问题，就是互助组形成自流，没有人管。高邑的生产互助，在去年有好多毛病，一般群众对互助的影响很坏，遗留问题很多，有些村一年到头没有算帐，形成吃亏的吃亏，沾光的沾光。因此今年生产工作布置时，即提出不强调组织互助，将来检查生产成绩，不单看组织起来几个组，主要检查生产成绩。但由于群众思想问题、春荒问题已解决，群众生产情绪提高了，我们没有抓住群众的热情，号召以真正自愿为原则来成立互助，干部也不知怎样干。有些村去年互助问题较少，群众还有要求组织起来的，但我们也没有意识的去帮助，形成了这一段生产组织的自流，同时对群众生产中其他一些困难，也解决的不够。
    检查后，又根据本县情况，决定了几个具体问题的解决：一、为开展大生产，克服一些村干不动及生产没人领导的现象，决定各村成立生产委员会，专门负责统一领导生产，解决生产中的困难。个别村庄未经工作团成立的贫雇小组，一律解散。二、互助变工解决劳畜力困难，一定要真正民主自愿，不能强制硬编。只要省工群众愿意就行，临时变工也好。无劳力孤寡户之土地想办法也要种上，不能给有劳力的分配代耕，或往互助组硬安。如有的村经双方同意让有劳力的代种，除出负担外，双方分粮，这办法也可以采用。三、村干问题，说服教育好好领导生产，不要等待抽补。如错误不改继续犯，可向县报告，多占果实地暂且不退，但不能荒地。四、去年抗旱时，有的村强迫把水车打乱使用，把这户水车按到那户井上，现在有些原主想搬回但不敢，想修理使用也不敢修，又怕修了不能自己用，归了别人。现东西应一律归原主，今后不得强迫，如使用得经本主同意。五、这次贷款中有些强调用途，这曾限制了一些户的贷款。如有买牲口就能贷到，如作其他用的，即是贫雇也贷不到。今后可不论什么用途，只要用于生产即可。
