　　Going Deep Among the Masses to Resolve Ideological Problems
  　Houxiancheng Village Launches a Spring Plowing Upsurge
　　[Report from this newspaper] After Houxiancheng Village in Yuan Dynasty County adhered to the principle of voluntary mutual assistance and solved the production difficulties of poor peasants and hired laborers, production in the village started, but a mass production movement had not yet formed. In order to further improve production work, the village-based cadres systematically visited poor peasants and hired laborers to understand the situation and solicit opinions. Secondly, production committees and branch committees were convened to understand the situation. After casually discussing the ideological problems of the masses, and after individual visits and organizational understanding, it was discovered that the masses still had fears of "showing wealth" and dared not buy manure, and did not dare to get rich. Some people were brewing grievances about the greed and undemocratic practices of the anti-Agricultural Association chairman, and others were dissatisfied with the prohibition of free trade, suspecting that things were not really their own.
　　In order to solve the ideological problems of the masses, a mass meeting was held to re-explain the policies, especially the policy towards middle peasants, and the slogan "Labor to get rich is the most glorious" was put forward, calling on everyone to squeeze out all time to engage in production. It also called on the masses to squeeze out all their assets and think of various ways to buy manure for the land. It was declared that middle and poor peasants could freely buy and sell things without interference. Regarding the problem of individual bad cadres, it was explained on the one hand that it was correct to raise opinions, but during the spring plowing season, if the land was not prepared well and the farming season was missed, life would be even more difficult in the future. It would be better to postpone the issue until the land was planted and then formally address it. Afterwards, some people reflected that this was also acceptable, "Anyway, the dog can't eat the sun." After mobilization and explanation, the ideological problems of the masses were further resolved, and there was a new turning point in their enthusiasm. After the meeting, future production problems were discussed, and everyone first formulated a plowing plan, and currently concentrated all efforts to carry out rush plowing and harrowing of sorghum land.
　　The day after the mass meeting, a forum for poor peasants and hired laborers was held to solicit opinions and inspire them to play an active role in promoting production. At the same time, a branch member meeting was held, calling on Party members to play a exemplary role, resolutely and conscientiously implement the plowing plan discussed in the group, and ensure its early realization.
　　After the ideological problems of the masses were resolved, the production situation was completely renewed. In recent days, five or six carts a day have been going to Daming City to buy manure. The poor peasant Zhao Yuncheng burns his own thatch roots and sells the existing firewood to buy manure. Zhao Yunjun's family sold four of the only nine *xiaodou* of grain left to buy manure, planning to plant the land and then sell their labor for food. Nine of the twenty-six Party members took the lead in buying manure. In seven days, the village bought sixty-five carts of manure. The plowing work was even more intense and active. Twenty-one households that fed cattle made full use of their time, using cattle to plow and harrow the land. Thirty-two households pushed manure with manpower. In addition to plowing the land with cattle, Zhao Jinglin also carried a hoe, and when the cattle rested, he picked up the hoe and tilled the land.
　　Based on the progress of production work in the village, we have learned that solving the ideological problems of the masses is the central key to mobilizing the masses for production and launching a production upsurge. Cadres should not think that once ideological problems are solved, that's the end of it. They should go deep among the masses to discover ideological problems and mobilize and explain them in a timely manner in order to gradually improve the situation.
　　After the rectification of mutual assistance, the poor peasants participated in mutual assistance to solve the problems of tools and livestock. It was not disadvantageous for middle peasants and poor peasants to assist each other, and there were certain mutual aid objects, which reduced a lot of trouble. In the past, when production was underway, people constantly came to borrow livestock, which was really difficult to deal with. There are no objections to mutual assistance because the basic problem is voluntary association. Although the leadership had some inspiration, it was not a forced order, nor was it organized to pursue achievements and emphasize form. (Yuan Dynasty County Party Committee Office)

### 深入群众解决思想问题　后现城掀起春耕热潮

　　深入群众解决思想问题
  　后现城掀起春耕热潮
    【本报消息】元朝后现城村坚持自愿互助原则，解决贫雇生产困难后，该村生产虽已动起来，但未形成群众性的生产运动。坐村干部为把生产工作提高一步，有计划的访问贫雇，了解情况，征求意见。第二步又召开了生产委员会、支部委员会了解情况，漫扯群众思想问题，又经过个别访问与通过组织了解后，发现群众还存在着怕露富名不敢买粪，不敢发家致富的思想。有的群众在酝酿反农会长贪污及不民主作风，还有的群众对禁止自由买卖不满，怀疑东西还不是自己的。
    为解决群众思想问题，召开了群众大会，重新讲解政策，特别是对中农政策，提出劳动发家最光荣的口号，号召挤出一切时间搞生产。并号召群众挤出一切资财，想各种办法，买粪上地。声明中贫农东西可自由买卖，不加干涉。对个别干部不好问题，一方说明有意见提出是正确的，但在春耕时期，如果地打整不好，误了农时，今后生活更是困难，不如推迟一步，地种上后，再正式进行。接着有的群众反映这也可以，反正狗吃不了日头。经过动员解释后，群众的思想问题，又得到进一步的解决，情绪又有新的转机。会后就酝酿起今后的生产问题，大家首先订出翻土计划，目前集中一切力量突击犁耙高粱地。
    群众大会后，次日又召开了贫雇座谈，征求意见，启发贫雇在生产中起积极推动作用。同时召开支部党员大会，号召党员起模范作用，对组里讨论的翻土计划，坚决认真执行，保证早日实现。
    群众思想问题解决后，生产情况焕然一新，近几日来每天是五六辆小车到大名城里买粪去，贫农赵云成自己拾茅根烧，将现有的柴卖掉买粪。赵云俊家仅剩九小斗粮食卖了四小斗买粪，计划把地种上，再出卖劳力吃饭。二十六个党员有九个带头买粪的，七天时间该村买到了六十五小车粪。在翻土工作上更为紧张积极。喂牛户赶晌使活者二十一户，牛犁耙土地，人力推粪者三十二户，赵景林用牛犁地外，自己还带着＠头，当牛休息时，又拿起＠头倒地。
    根据该村生产工作的进展，我们体验到解决群众思想问题是发动群众生产，掀起生产热潮的中心关键，干部们不要认为一次解决了思想问题后，就算完事啦，应该深入群众发现思想问题，及时动员解释才能逐步提高。
    整顿互助后，贫农参加互助解决了工具和牲口困难问题，中农和贫农在一块互助也不吃亏，有一定互助对象，少了不少麻烦，过去生产时不断有人来借牲口，实在难应酬。对互助所以没意见，基本问题是自愿结合的，领导虽有启发，但不是强迫命令，不是追求成绩讲求形式组织的。（元朝县委办公室）
