Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Rome dispatch: The reactionary government of De Gasperi, directed by special agents of the "Christian Democratic Party" and the "Catholic Action," desperately carried out fraud and various conspiracies in the general election, attempting to make this election a sham election that suits their interests. They forced people with infectious diseases and serious illnesses to vote for the Christian Democratic Party. Several seriously ill people died on the spot after voting. Priests and nuns almost all used fake votes or held two or three ballots per person. On the 18th, reactionary Catholic organizations made 100,000 telephone calls to private residences in Rome, threatening people that if they did not vote, they would not allow the dead souls of their families to ascend to heaven, and would not handle their marriages or burials, etc. At the same time, De Gasperi's Minister of the Interior, Scelba, imitating Mussolini's "Social Security Ordinance," ordered that from the end of voting on the 19th, any meetings and gatherings on the streets or indoors were prohibited, and forced all factory and agency employees to take a three-day "vacation" from the 19th, attempting to use this to implement his "hands-on" conspiracy when the special agency of the Ministry of the Interior tallied the votes. De Gasperi's kept newspapers also spread rumors that the People's Democratic Front had arranged a "plan" to hold demonstrations and marches in order to cancel the election results. Moro (Labor Democratic Party), one of the members of the Presidium of the People's Democratic Front, exposed that these rumors "are sufficient to demonstrate the reactionary faction's attempt to undermine public peace."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Rome dispatch: According to the Republican newspaper on the 16th, after the Soviet Union declared its support for restoring Italian trusteeship over its former colonies, Marshall, Bevin, and Bidault hurriedly exchanged letters. Marshall said: For the sake of American interests in Eritrea and Tripoli, the Soviet proposal cannot be approved. Bevin replied: The British government is also opposed to the Soviet proposal, because the British government is willing to maintain its control over Somaliland and Cyrenaica. Bidault said: France originally advocated giving Italy a mandate, but in order to exchange for the lease of its territory in Fezzan (in Libya), it can modify its attitude. As a result of the exchange of views between the three foreign ministers, it was decided not to raise this issue before April 18, because they were afraid that raising this issue would expose their imperialist face and thus endanger the election of right-wing parties. In order to avoid their response to the Soviet proposal and divert the attention of the Italian people, they published a statement "generously giving away" Trieste to Italy, and suggested that Italy join the United Nations.

　　意反动派玩弄阴谋威胁群众选举他们
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】罗马讯：加斯贝利反动政府指使“基督教民主党”与“天主教行动党”的特务们，在大选中拼命施行舞弊及各种阴谋，妄图使这次大选成为合乎他们利益的伪选。他们强迫害传染病及重病的人前往投基督教民主党的票，有几个重病号在投票后当场死掉。教士和修女几乎每人都使用假票或一人持有两三张选票。反动的天主教组织十八日曾对罗马私人住宅打了十万次电话，威吓人们如果不投票就不给家庭的死灵魂升天，不给他们办理结婚或埋葬等等。同时加斯贝利政府内长谢尔巴仿效墨索里尼“社会治安条例”，下令从十九日投票结束后起，禁止举行任何会议及在街头或户内聚集，并强迫一切工厂及机关职工从十九日起“休假”三天，企图以此在内政部特设机构结算选票时实行其“放手干”的阴谋。加斯贝利的御用报纸，同时大肆造谣，说人民民主阵线布置了一个“计划”，即举行示威游行，以便取消选举的结果。人民民主阵线主席团之一莫罗（劳工民主党）加以揭发称：这些流言“适足表现反动派欲破坏公共和平的企图”。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】罗马讯：据共和报十六日消息，在苏联声明赞成恢复意国对其前属殖民地的托管后，马歇尔、贝文与比道尔即慌忙交换信件。马歇尔说：为了美国在厄立特利亚的黎波里的利益，不能赞同苏联的建议。贝文复函说：英政府也同样反对苏联建议，因为英政府愿意保持其对索马利兰与昔兰尼加的控制权。比道尔则说：法国原主张给意国以委任统治权，但为了换取其在斐赞（在利比亚）领土的租借权，可以修改其态度。三外长交换意见的结果，决定在四月十八日以前不提出这个问题，因为他们害怕提出这个问题后，会揭露其帝国主义面目，因而对右翼党派的竞选发生危险。为了避免他们对苏联建议的答复，并转移意人民的视线，于是发表了将的里雅斯特交意的“慷他人之慨”的声明，及建议意大利参加联合国。
