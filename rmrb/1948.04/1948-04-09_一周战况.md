Weekly War Situation
    April 1st to 7th
    On the southern front, the People's Liberation Army's powerful corps continued to expand the results of the spring offensive. After the East China People's Liberation Army swept through the western section of the Jiaoji Railway and advanced into Zichuan and other places, they divided their forces and advanced eastward and westward. The Chiang bandits in Longkou, Penglai, and Weihaiwei, awed by the victorious power of our army, abandoned their cities in panic on the 28th and 30th of last month. By this point, since the East China People's Liberation Army launched the Jiaoji Western Section offensive on March 11th, they had annihilated more than 38,000 Chiang bandits, and captured 17 important cities including Zichuan, Boshan, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, Laiwu, Mengyin, Yishui, Yidu, Linzi, Huantai, Changshan, Zouping, Qidong, Zhangqiu, Longkou, Penglai, and Weihaiwei, controlling over 300 miles of the Jiaoji Western Section and the Zhangbo branch line. The Chiang bandits' point and line defense was completely shattered, and the situation in Shandong has undergone a major change. Now the entire Jiaoji line is paralyzed, Jinan is in a state of emergency, and Changle and Weixian have become isolated islands on land. The main force of the Chiang bandits has been driven to the narrow areas of the Jinpu Railway, the Linzao Railway, Lin (Yi) Tan (Cheng) and Ri (Zhao) Hai (Zhou), as well as isolated cities such as Qingdao, Jimo, Yantai, and Fushan, trembling and waiting to be annihilated.

    After the Yu-Shaan-E People's Liberation Army strategically withdrew from Luoyang on the 18th of last month, they recaptured this important central plains town on the 5th, completely annihilating the 371st Regiment of the 124th Brigade of the 41st Division of the defending bandits. The defending bandits in Yanshi, terrified upon hearing the news, abandoned the city and fled eastward on the 6th, and the city was also liberated.

    On the northern front, our army recaptured Fengzhen, an important town in eastern Suiyuan, on the 27th of last month, and continued to fiercely attack the Fu bandits on both sides of the Ping-Sui Railway. The democratic government is carrying out emergency post-war reconstruction work in the vast recovered areas scarred by war.

    Under the victorious offensive of the field army, local armed forces in various regions on the northern and southern fronts actively cooperated in combat, converging to annihilate remnant bandits and local bullies, capturing Baihe County, a strategic point in Shaanxi and Hubei, annihilating more than 1,500 enemies (on the 1st), and capturing Jun County in western Hubei (on the 21st of last month), Tangyin City in northern Henan (on the 24th of last month), and Aoshanwei, a coastal strategic location in Jiaodong, and Lusi Town, a famous fishing port in Qidong, central Jiangsu, completely recovering 800 miles of the vast area along the southern coast of the Longhai Railway, and capturing many important towns and strongholds such as Changhanying, a defensive barrier for Liangcheng in southern Suiyuan. Local armed forces in the Yu-Shaan-E districts also widely launched struggles to suppress bandits and protect farmland. The 5th sub-district annihilated more than 4,500 bandits in two months. The 4th sub-district alone annihilated more than 2,000 bandits last month. Local armed forces in central Jiangsu completely annihilated four companies of the 21st Division's directly subordinate military brigade on the 24th of last month.

    In the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army, new soldiers are rushing to the front lines in a steady stream. The powerful second-line corps of the Northeast Liberated Area have set off for the front lines, and large numbers of liberated peasants from Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu are also pouring into the main force of the People's Liberation Army on the southern front. Because the new soldiers have a clear stance, a high level of political awareness, are eager to learn, and have democratic habits of life, they develop a vigorous spirit and strengthen the morale of the troops as soon as they arrive in the army.

专栏：一周战况

　　一周战况
    四月一日至七日
    南线解放军强大兵团，继续扩大春季攻势战果，华东解放军于横扫胶济铁路西段进驻淄川等地后，即分兵向东西推进。龙口、蓬莱、威海卫之蒋匪，慑于我军胜利威势，纷于上月二十八日及三十日仓惶弃城逃逸。至此，华东解放军自三月十一日发动胶济西段攻势以来，已歼灭蒋匪三万八千余名，攻克淄川、博山、周村、张店、莱芜、蒙阴、沂水、益都、临淄、桓台、长山、邹平、齐东、章邱、龙口、蓬莱、威海卫等重要城市十七座，控制胶济西段及张博支路达三百余里。完全粉碎了蒋匪的点线防御，山东局势已发生重大变化。现胶济全线瘫痪，济南告急，昌乐潍县变成陆上孤岛，蒋匪主力已被驱逐至津浦线、临枣线、临（沂）郯（城）和日（照）海（州）的狭长地带，以及青岛、即墨、烟台、福山等孤立城市，战战兢兢坐以待歼。
    豫陕鄂解放军上月十八日机动撤出洛阳后，五日重克此中原重镇，全歼守匪四十一师一二四旅三七一团。偃师守匪闻风丧胆，六日弃城东窜，该城亦同告光复。
    北线我军则于上月二十七日再克绥东重镇丰镇，并在平绥沿线两侧继续痛击傅匪。民主政府正对疮痍满目的广大收复区进行紧急善后工作。
    在野战大军胜利攻势下，南北两线各地地方武装积极配合作战，聚歼残匪与土顽，攻克陕鄂要冲白河县城，歼敌一千五百余名（一日），又攻克鄂西之均县城（上月二十一日），豫北之汤阴城（上月二十四日），及胶东滨海要地鳌山卫、苏中启东北之著名渔港吕四镇，完全收复陇海路南沿海八百里广大地区，以及攻克绥南凉城屏障之厂汉营等重镇及据点多处。豫陕鄂各分区地方武装并广泛展开剿匪保田斗争，五分区二个月内歼匪四千五百余名。四分区仅上月份内，即歼匪二千余名。苏中地方武装则于上月二十四日全歼匪二十一师直属军事大队四个中队。
    在解放军强大攻势中新战士源源奔赴前线。东北解放区强大的第二线兵团已开赴前线，晋冀鲁豫大批翻身农民也源源涌入南线解放军主力，由于新战士立场明确，政治认识较高，学习积极，富有民主的生活习惯，因此一到部队，就发展了蓬勃的朝气，加强了部队的斗志。
