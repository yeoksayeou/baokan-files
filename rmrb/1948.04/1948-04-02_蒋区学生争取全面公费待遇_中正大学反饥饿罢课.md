Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 31st: According to foreign news agency reports: On the second day of the opening of the Chiang bandit's "Piglet National Congress" (i.e., the 30th), the students of Jiangxi Nanchang Zhongzheng University, named after the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek, launched a strike against hunger, demanding full public funding for students, increased salaries for faculty and staff, and reasonable school funding. The faculty and staff of the school support the striking students and stated that if the goal of salary increases is not achieved, they will be forced to change careers. At the same time, all students at Chongqing University in Sichuan also made the same demands. However, on the same day, the Chiang bandit's Ministry of Education announced its rejection of the students' demands from both schools, and it is widely believed that the students' righteous movement will expand.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 30th: Tianjin Newspaper reports: Universities in Peiping and Tianjin continue to fight for full public funding. Self-funded and partially publicly funded students at Peking University formed the "Joint Association for Striving for Public Funding" on the evening of the 9th of this month. On the 14th, they collectively petitioned the school, demanding full public funding. The Chiang Party authorities at the school were forced to temporarily lend money to students to pay for meal expenses this month. The meal expenses for this month have risen to over 2 million Chiang currency, a sharp increase of 300,000 to 400,000 compared to last month. On the "Democracy Wall" of Tsinghua University, various student groups have successively published articles, denouncing the Chiang bandits for violating the promise that "education funds should account for at least 15 percent of the total budget," pointing out that the Chiang bandits' education funds this year account for only 0.3 percent of the budget, and proposing full public funding, distribution of supplies, and reform of curriculum and education system. The general self-funded students at Tangshan Institute of Technology are unable to pay for meal expenses. As a result of the efforts of the school's "Committee for Striving for Full Public Funding," the Chiang Party authorities at the school were forced to accept the students' demands at the beginning of this month, promising each impoverished student a loan of one million yuan to pay for meal expenses. However, students at Peking University and Tangshan Institute of Technology believe that temporary loans can only alleviate the immediate crisis, and full public funding must be achieved to avoid the threat of hunger.

　　蒋区学生争取全面公费待遇
  　中正大学反饥饿罢课
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】据外国通讯社报导：蒋匪猪仔伪国大开幕之次日（即三十日），以匪首蒋介石名字命令的江西南昌中正大学全校学生已举行反饥饿罢课，提出学生全面公费待遇，增加教职员薪津及学校经费等合理要求。该校教职员均支持罢课学生，并表示加薪目的不达，他们将被迫转业。与此同时，四川重庆大学全体学生亦提出同样要求。但同日蒋匪教育部已宣布拒绝两校学生的要求，众信学生正义运动将趋扩大。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】津报讯：平津各大学继续为争取全面公费而斗争。北大自费生及半公费生，于本月九日晚组成“争取公费联合会”，十四日集体向校方请愿，要求全面公费，该校蒋党当局被迫答应本月份暂时贷款给学生缴纳膳费。该校本月份膳费已涨达蒋币二百余万元，比之上月又剧增三、四十万。清华大学“民主墙”上，各学生团体纷纷发表文告，痛斥蒋匪违背“教育经费至少占总预算百分之十五”的诺言，指出蒋匪今年教育经费仅占预算百分之零点三，并提出全面公费、配发实物及改革课程及教育制度等要求。唐山工学院一般自费学生已无力缴纳膳费。该校“争取全面公费委员会”力争结果，校方蒋党当局于本月初被迫接纳学生要求，答应每一穷困学生贷款一百万元缴纳膳费。但北大、唐工两校学生认为：暂时贷款只能济一时之急，必须争取全面公费实现，始可免于饥饿威胁。
