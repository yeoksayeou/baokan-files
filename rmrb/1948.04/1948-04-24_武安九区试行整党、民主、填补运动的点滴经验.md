Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 20th. After the Jinji-Luyu Central Bureau Land Conference, Comrade Zhang Panshi led a work team to start working with Zhaozhuang in the Ninth District of Wu'an, Taihang, as the base point and the surrounding eight villages. The leadership mainly participated in Zhaozhuang to gain experience and guide the nearby villages at any time. After the masses were initially organized (generally after the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League and the Peasants' Association), a part of the cadres was transferred to the nearby villages in a wave-like manner. In the past two and a half months, they have advanced three times and gradually gained experience. A total of fifteen villages have been carried out, and the rectification, democracy, and fill-in-the-gaps work has been largely completed in general.

I. General Situation and Characteristics of the Work Area

The Ninth District of Wu'an became a guerrilla base area in 1940. In 1942, rent reduction and interest reduction began. After the investigation and reduction of rents and the anti-traitor liquidation in 1945, the land reform movement after the May 4th Directive, and the filling-in-the-gaps, squeezing out feudalism and cutting off the tail, feudalism has been basically eliminated; the peasants have all obtained land; and the composition of the branch is also good. However, there are problems with the work style. Compulsory orders, arbitrary decisions, and undemocratic practices have become the main characteristics of each village. Due to the bureaucracy of the leadership, it can be said that the more the higher authorities think it is a good branch, the more problems there are. In order to strive for model villages and complete tasks, regardless of whether the masses can bear it or not, they block the upper levels and rule the lower levels. The general masses feel that the cadres are like new flagstones. The masses in Shidong and Tian Erzhuang call the cadres "a swarm of bees." The village cadres' hanging, beating, bundling, fining, and scolding of the masses are very serious, causing unease among the masses. This kind of feudal hanging, beating, bundling, and fining was mainly manifested in the forced confessions of special agents before the land reform; the most serious during the land reform was the digging of underground treasures during the filling-in-the-gaps last spring and the squeezing out of feudalism and cutting off the tail last autumn; in addition, after the masses in various places washed the cadres' faces and smeared them black last year, the cadres' retaliatory behavior was very common. The two times of resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses both ended with the leadership supporting the cadres. Therefore, the masses dare not speak easily and dare not raise opinions to the cadres, but they are eager to transform the cadres and implement democracy. So, it is very difficult to enlighten the masses to speak boldly. In the early days of the work team's arrival in the village, the masses still took a distrustful attitude.

In terms of land distribution, there are several different situations after careful inspection: First, the quantity is even, but the quality is very different. For example, the average land number of sixteen poor peasant households in Tian Erzhuang is 0.2 mu higher than the village average, but the land of the village chief and the branch secretary is equal to the sum of all the good land of the sixteen poor peasant households. Second, the land of the poor peasants and hired laborers is both far away and fragmented, which takes more effort to work. Third, from the perspective of the masses, each household is roughly the same, but the cadres are above the general level.

Although feudalism has been basically eliminated in each village, the struggle surface is very wide, which seriously harmed the middle peasants. The objects of struggle generally account for one-quarter of the number of households in the village, and the proportion of those swept out of the house is quite large. For example, among the 133 households in Guzhen who were objects of struggle, 80 households were swept out of the house. The reasons for harming the middle peasants are mainly the determination of class composition and the pursuit of three generations, squeezing out feudalism, digging air-raid shelters, and wearing the hats of special agents. Some of them are implicated by relatives or parents, brothers, and sisters, and some are cadres and party members taking the opportunity to retaliate. Often, some savings are struggled against. In villages such as Niutou in Zhaozhuang, middle peasants who were struggled against were uniformly called landlords, and the number almost accounted for 90% of the households struggled against in the village. Therefore, this has caused difficulties for this fill-in-the-gaps work: the land requirements of the poor peasants and hired laborers who have not been thoroughly turned over must be met, the wrongly struggled middle peasants must be compensated, and a share must also be given to the landlords and rich peasants. The total amount of land occupied by cadres is not large, but in each village, there is a part of the middle peasants whose average output exceeds the average output of the poor peasants and hired laborers by more than one time. It is difficult to fill in the gaps without moving the middle peasants. Without strong leadership, it is difficult not to make the mistake of infringing on the interests of the middle peasants again.

The past work foundation in this area is generally good, and the composition of party members and cadres is mostly poor peasants and hired laborers. No landlord or rich peasant party members have been found. However, due to the bad work style of the cadres and party members, the struggle against landlords and rich peasants was also carried out by a small number of activists, so that 10% to 30% of the honest poor peasants and hired laborers did not thoroughly turn over. After this movement, many honest poor peasants and hired laborers were found in each village to be very capable. For example, the five members of the Poor Peasants' League in Hexi Village were people who had never dared to speak up in the past and had never spoken on the stage. Two or three of them performed better in this movement than the past cadres and party members, and they were all upright. Several poor peasants and hired laborers who were newly elected as members of the Poor Peasants' League, members of the Peasants' Association, and members of the village government in Zhaozhuang were supported by the masses of the whole village, and they had not appeared for a long time in the past. Therefore, in large villages in the above-mentioned areas, it is sometimes necessary to organize the Poor Peasants' League. When the Poor Peasants' League is not organized, special attention should be paid to mobilizing this bottom layer and ensuring that they must turn over no matter what this time.

II. Reorganizing the Ranks

Because the party members and cadres have very strict rule in the villages, if the party and mass ranks are not reorganized first, problems cannot be discovered, and work cannot be carried out. Therefore, the first thing to do is to promote democracy among the masses in order to discover the central problems. Therefore, reorganization is divided into two stages:

The first stage is to let go of democracy, discover problems, and discover activists.

As soon as the work team arrived in the village, some people lived in the homes of poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants, and widely publicized among the masses what they were doing this time. At the same time, individual visits were conducted, focusing on poor peasants and hired laborers, including middle peasants and party members, to solicit their opinions on past work and cadres. At the beginning, the honest poor peasants and hired laborers dared not speak, fearing that they would suffer retaliation from the cadres again like "washing faces and smearing black" last year. Therefore, they were told that this time it would never be like "washing faces and smearing black" in the past, and the masses would be supported to the end. At the same time, the staff lived with them and gradually gained their trust, breaking their concerns, and they also spoke their hearts. Another part of the work team, after arriving in the village, convened a branch meeting, clarified the democracy, party rectification, and filling-in-the-gaps to them, explained the danger of the party being separated from the masses, and some of the mistakes of the branch being separated from the masses in the past should be the responsibility of the higher authorities, insufficient education for party members, and impractical task assignments, resulting in compulsory orders, etc. Some should be the responsibility of the party members themselves. For the benefit of the broad masses of the people, this problem must be solved now, and it must be explained that the party should be openly discussed among the masses and asked what their opinions are. Generally, they have no opinions, because they understand the higher authorities' routines, and every time they say it very seriously, and then they will muddle through. Later, the party members in some villages heard about the party rectification in other villages and knew that it would not work if they did not rectify, so their attitude of reflection was relatively honest. As for openly discussing the party, only a few good party members were openly discussed in the past. This time, all party members must be openly discussed. Although bad party members are unwilling, they have no reason to object.

After the party members and the masses have made ideological preparations, a villagers' meeting is convened to announce that the branch will be rectified, reflecting and awaiting review, the cadres will continue to work as usual, and no passive resistance to work is allowed; everyone is mobilized to raise opinions on the cadres and past work, to help rectify the party, and it is explained that this time the work must be done well according to the opinions of the masses. The list of party members was made public at the meeting, explaining what party members should do, and asking everyone to see if the party members in this village in the past were like this, but no fighting is allowed and no one is allowed to beat people. At the same time, it was mobilized to classify classes, explaining that after the class of each person is determined, they will not be randomly struggled against, and those who have been randomly struggled against can be corrected, those who have gained more fruits should return them, those who have not been thoroughly turned over should be supplemented, and those who have been wrongly struggled against should be compensated. In this way, everyone has a democratic status, and there is a guarantee in political and life. This time, a particularly large number of people participated in the meeting, and many people wanted to test the work team's attitude. After the meeting, the party members, cadres, and the masses were greatly shocked, but they were still a little skeptical. The party members said, "Will it really be done this way?" The masses said, "You can't not believe it, and you can't completely believe it!"

Then classify classes. First, the work team studied some types in the village and tentatively classified several poor peasants and hired laborers. When classifying, first talk about class and give detailed explanations using examples from the village. It was relatively slow at the beginning of the classification, but later the masses became proficient and classified very quickly. They said, "In the past, there was no accurate way to classify classes. The ruler was in the cadre's pocket, and he said whatever he wanted. This time, there is a ruler in everyone's hands, and it is convenient to classify whether it is long or short." Everyone generally felt that this method was simple, fair, and easy to understand, especially the middle peasants were satisfied. The rich middle peasants said, "This is great, we are not landlords or rich peasants after all." Everyone felt that "this is a reward for labor." Some newly turned-over poor peasants and hired laborers felt that they were turning into new middle peasants in one year and had a weak foundation and had difficulties. Generally, old middle peasants were willing to be classified as new middle peasants, and new middle peasants were willing to be classified as poor peasants. They argued so much that their faces turned red, comparing each other, exposing each other, and being very serious. The work team generally encouraged this kind of debate among the masses in order to find out the facts, but because democracy was emphasized (which was correct), some people always said that their thinking was not clear, comparing life, comparing history, comparing politics, comparing attitudes, etc., which took a long time. The leadership continuously insisted on principles and guided the masses to the correct direction, emphasizing what it is is what it is, so that various deviations were corrected.

In some places, the objects of struggle, cadres, party members, and the masses are classified together in the classification of classes, but because these three parts of people are not very harmonious, it is not convenient to speak together. Generally, they are classified separately, or the masses and party members and cadres are classified first, and then everyone classifies the objects of struggle. When classifying the objects of struggle, the wrongly struggled people are preliminarily corrected. When talking about the issue of special agents, it is emphasized that the person should argue for himself, let the masses review and remove the hats, and without evidence and without the handling of the higher authorities, people cannot be given hats indiscriminately. If it is not clear, the materials should be sent to the higher authorities for handling, and the village cannot casually decide who is a special agent.

After this, the masses were mobilized to raise opinions to the cadres and party members. The cadres and party members did not participate (so that the masses could speak boldly). After the opinions were raised, the masses were asked to elect representatives to raise them to the branch. Then, a branch meeting was convened, and the work team and the branch, as well as representatives of the masses, participated to form a party rectification committee or a presidium. In this way, it is convenient to combine the understanding of the situation of the masses and party members. The representatives of the masses participate in the presidium, which can maintain order and prevent fighting. At this meeting, only representatives of the masses are allowed to raise opinions to the cadres and party members, and the cadres and party members do not make any arguments for the time being (it is declared that they have the right to appeal later), in order to avoid threatening the masses from speaking and to avoid angering the masses and causing fights. At this time, the masses should be allowed to raise opinions freely, and there is no need to be afraid of the opinions of the retaliatory elements, because the honest masses still dare not speak. They know that the retaliatory elements are not better than some cadres and party members, but they are willing to let the retaliatory elements vent their anger for them. At the same time, the opinions raised by the retaliatory elements are mostly facts (the weight may be somewhat exaggerated). After this meeting, the party members were greatly surprised and felt that the opinions of the masses far exceeded their own reflections, which greatly promoted the reflection of the party members. The honest peasants felt that the retaliatory elements were not upright and not as good as raising their own opinions.

After individual visits and classification of classes, a part of the honest poor peasants and hired laborers has been connected, and poor peasant groups have been organized. At this time, the branch called on any poor peasant party members who were willing to conduct reflection in the poor peasant groups to participate in the poor peasant groups. Anyone who asked to participate in the poor peasant groups went to participate. People who go there are considered to be able to participate in the poor peasant groups and can also be party members. Those party members who have been passed back to the party have launched criticism and self-criticism, distinguishing the boundaries between good party members and bad party members, and differentiating the "swarm of bees" of the branch.

At this time, the masses have risen, and honest and upright activists have also emerged. The good and bad of the party members and the severity of the mistakes have also been clarified. However, in this stage, the work team should not have a fixed view on the problems of this village and on the good and bad of the party members in advance.

The second stage of reorganizing the ranks: Organize.

After the masses have vented their anger, they ask to be organized to be the masters of their own affairs. In places where there are many poor peasants and hired laborers, in order to avoid splitting with the middle peasants, the Poor Peasants' League may not be organized, or after the Poor Peasants' League is formed, the middle peasants are immediately connected to form a new Peasants' Association. In places where there are few poor peasants and hired laborers, the poor peasant groups can be used as the basis to connect the middle peasants and directly re-elect the Peasants' Association, but it must be guaranteed that the poor peasants and hired laborers can be elected to the Peasants' Association Committee in order to guarantee the interests of the poor peasants and hired laborers. If there are no middle peasants or too few middle peasants in the new Peasants' Association Committee, the poor peasants and hired laborers should generally give up one-third of the positions to the middle peasants. After the Peasants' Association is established, large villages elect peasant representatives, and small and medium-sized villages generally directly elect village government members. In the process of organizing, the masses, based on past experience—they did not become masters of their own affairs and elected bad people as cadres—were very serious this time. First of all, the conditions for joining the league and joining the association were very strict at the beginning, such as saying that those who do not work well should not join, and hooligans should not join, etc. However, the leadership should overcome the tendency of closing the door in a timely manner. The opinion of the masses is to first establish a good foundation, and then educate those with problems and let them participate after they correct them. Generally, the whole village conducts criticism and self-criticism, and then gradually joins the association. After the peasants conduct criticism and self-criticism, they elect good people during the election, and good party members are also elected. However, retaliatory elements and unscrupulous people, although they repeatedly carried out activities, were not elected. But one thing should be noted, whether it is rectifying the party or reorganizing the mass ranks, the masses emphasize good people, which is actually a supra-class viewpoint. The work team should be clear that good people are not only upright and hardworking, but also have clear class distinctions.

When the Poor Peasants' League was established, some party members were passed to participate. When the new Peasants' Association was established, another part of the party members was passed to participate. Participating in the new Peasants' Association means that they can be party members. Criticism and self-criticism within the party is more in-depth. However, a part of the party members (about one-third, generally the cadres in power) still failed to pass, and they felt great pressure and had no way out. At the same time, the party members who have passed, because their thinking has not completely solved the problem, and the old work style has not been completely changed for a while, have also encountered some nails in the Peasants' Association and the Poor Peasants' League. These people are easily won over by the party members who have not passed and become "a swarm of bees" again. At this time, the leadership should give the party members more enthusiasm and comfort, mainly pointing out the way out. It is explained that as long as the reflection is good, the masses can forgive them; as long as the mistakes are corrected, there is a way out. In addition, the work team summoned the members of the Poor Peasants' League and the Peasants' Association and discussed with them, asking what they thought should be done with the party members and cadres who had not passed. They asked what methods the party had. After explaining that the party’s mistakes were divided into different levels and given punishments, such as admonishment, warning, probation within the party, expulsion, etc. They agreed with this method, but generally the punishments were very heavy, and they declared that they had not yet handed over the accounts, and the accounts had not yet been settled, so this punishment could not be finally determined. At this point, the ranks of the masses have been compiled, but the ranks of the party still need to be completed in combination with the next stage of the extraction and supplementation work; because some facts in the relationship between the party and the masses have not been finally clarified, and the anger of the masses towards the party members has not diminished, if the party rectification is ended prematurely, the scope of punishment must be very wide and very heavy.

III. Carry out extraction and supplementation, implement democracy, and complete party rectification in combination with the practice of extraction and supplementation.

First of all, the old and new cadres make accounts, mainly settling accounts and receiving fruits. The masses are very concerned about these things, and they elect special personnel to carry them out seriously. We must let the masses calculate. Even if we know that some accounts cannot be calculated clearly, we have to let them calculate. However, two things should be paid attention to. One is that the peasant cadres are illiterate, and most of the accounts are unclear. Because of the past undemocratic practices, the accounts have been lost. The second is that the fruits were not properly kept in the past, and loss is inevitable. There is also a misconception among the masses, that is, to distribute the fruits of a small number of landlords and rich peasants to the majority of the peasants in the whole village. Everyone feels that the landlords have a lot of things, and they get very little, so they replace facts with speculation. For example, if it is said that an object of struggle has a pair of silver bracelets, then dozens of objects of struggle should have dozens of pairs! This way of drilling the horn of the bull forms a forced confession against the party members and cadres, and even advocates that they must be hanged and beaten. At this time, the leadership should no longer emphasize simply settling the accounts clearly, but should combine the settlement of accounts with the receipt of fruits. Secondly, when the objects of struggle are finally reviewed, the whole village will classify classes again. The old cadres will talk about why some people were wrongly struggled in the past, which ones were due to ignorance, which ones were for revenge, and which ones were fought by the higher authorities on official business, so that the rights and wrongs and responsibilities are clarified, especially those who were fought in the name of special agents, must be responsible for removing their hats, and the historical situation of the people being fought must also be introduced. Some villages call it "explaining the political situation." Thirdly, extract and measure the land, extract and evaluate the yield. Generally, there is the idea of village centrism, wanting to reduce the land yield in the village in an attempt to pay less public grain. The work team proposed that the burdens of each village are unfair, and the village peasant representatives and county peasant representatives will solve it in the future. The current main task is to solve the problem of extraction and supplementation. If any piece of land is unfair, it can be extracted and measured to obtain a general fairness. The masses agree with this view. However, the past unfairness was mainly that the old cadres reduced their own burdens and retaliated against others, so the masses demanded that the old cadres participate in the extraction and measurement, let them say and correct themselves, and with the public discussion of the masses, it is roughly the same. Fourthly, report and publicly discuss the deficit households. Generally, the reporting is not true. Do not have fixed opinions on this, repeatedly promote democracy, let the masses publicly discuss and expose each other. It should be noted here that the average yield should not be calculated by dividing the total yield of the village by the population of the whole village. The yield of the old middle peasants whose average yield exceeds the average yield of the whole village by more than one time should be removed first, so that the average yield will not be too high and there will not be too many deficit households. Fifthly, report and publicly discuss the "heap households", explaining that those who have gained more fruits should return them. The old middle peasants automatically give up the land under conditions that are beneficial to them (such as paying less burden, not being able to plant it, etc.), but it should be declared that they are not being struggled against. Party members and cadres should pay attention when returning fruits, and should not return them to the point where the yield is not enough. In general, party members and cadres perform very well in returning fruits. They say, "I would rather have political fruits." The masses are very moved by this. Sixthly, evaluate and extract and supplement. Because the scope of struggle in the past was wide, and most of them were swept out of the house, and some poor peasants and hired laborers did not thoroughly turn over, the deficit households are very large when added up. The part of the party members and cadres who have gained more is not large in total. The deficit is large, the heap is small, and the "left" thinking of some comrades of the work team and the masses, its danger is either unwilling to give a share to the objects of struggle, unwilling to compensate the losses of the struggled middle peasants, or forcing the middle peasants to take things out, and some even ask the government for relief. This is mainly a matter of thought. In fact, as long as the peasants are allowed to discuss it themselves, it can be solved in the general village. Several issues should also be noted in the discussion: First, oppose absolute average, and emphasize that it is roughly the same; Second, oppose extreme democracy, and emphasize the principle of minority obeying the majority, and absolutely cannot change because one person disagrees. The middle peasants also need necessary criticism. Emphasize that those who have been wrongly struggled should be compensated, and do not easily allow "eat what you spit out" or "return the original to the original owner". Because it has already been divided, it is enough to compensate for a considerable share. Some middle peasants have a higher yield after compensation than before they were wrongly struggled. Return the original if you can return it. The masses are satisfied with Tian Erzhuang returning the cattle and houses, and Guzhen returning the pharmacy. Finally, hold another villagers' meeting, at which: 1. Announce the results of the extraction and supplementation; 2. Finally determine the class; 3. Announce the punishment of party members; 4. Read Comrade Ren Bishi's "Several Issues in Land Reform" (this article has great educational significance for mass policy), and ask everyone to review and check the work of this village based on this. Before this, a branch meeting should also be held, and representatives of the masses should be invited to participate. Let the party members argue, which ones are their own mistakes, which ones are misunderstandings of the masses, which ones are for work, which ones are selfish, and which ones the higher authorities should be responsible for, and let the representatives of the masses finally evaluate. Because the party members and cadres performed very well when participating in the extraction and supplementation, the masses' perception has changed, and they demand that the scope of punishment for party members be greatly reduced, and the degree of punishment be greatly reduced. Generally, they do not advocate expulsion or only expel one or two. They emphasize "it is good to stay in the party for education." For example, the masses in Zhaozhuang said, "The Communist Party's method is good, and it is tightly controlled layer by layer. If it doesn't work in this layer, where else? If it doesn't work, expel it, so you can't wrong people." "Expelling a party member is like shooting a gun at the heart, so don't talk nonsense, this is not a small matter!" At the beginning, the masses demanded that the cadres and party members who had injured people be sent to the People's Court, but after the party rectification, the masses turned over politically and economically, vented their anger, and the cadres and party members, in addition to admitting their mistakes, automatically proposed to give pensions or help with some labor. The masses felt that this solution was not bad compared to sending them to the People's Court. When the branch discussed and the higher authorities approved the announcement of the punishment of the party members, the masses were very satisfied. At this meeting, the mobilization of production work was finally carried out.

IV. Expand the Results

First of all, the issue of party rectification. Before preparing to establish the Poor Peasants' League and passing the first batch of party members, the branch rarely carried out actual activities among the masses for a while. After passing the first batch of party members and participating in the Poor Peasants' League, the branch life was still unsound because there were still some party members who had not passed. After the extraction and supplementation began, another branch meeting was held to allow everyone to talk about the reasons for making mistakes, their opinions on the party above, and their opinions on this party rectification. Generally, they believed that this party rectification was very strict, but the party had always been trying to save them. Party member Li Huize of Zhaozhuang said, "It's a pity that the party rectification was too late. If it had been rectified two years earlier, we wouldn't have made so many mistakes!" Party member Ting Ming said, "From this party rectification, I can see that the party is closer than my own parents. When I was begging for food in the past, my parents gave me a bowl and told me to fill it up and that was it. The party not only made me turn over, but also made me walk on the right path." Everyone reviewed the reasons for making mistakes. One was being separated from the masses and not understanding that the masses had so many opinions on them and were so angry. One was that many people were confused when they joined the party, and the party life was very unsound after joining the party. The higher authorities only assigned tasks and rarely even educated and checked the party members. Therefore, they asked the higher authorities to consider how to educate them in the future; some party members suggested that the first and fifteenth of each month be designated as party days. In addition to regularly absorbing the masses to participate in the branch meeting, they should solicit the opinions of the masses once every two or three months. In the future, the political director should be abolished, and the party should no longer order the masses. However, in order to realize the party's leadership, the branch must regularly arrange and check the activities of the party members among the masses. Some of the masses are not united, especially the sectarianism. It is necessary to liquidate it again and break up all the factions, emphasizing class unity.

During the movement, the activities of young people and women were somewhat restricted. Often, young people dare not speak in front of old people, and women have more difficulty speaking in front of men. Therefore, young people and women should have their own separate organizations in the Peasants' Association. Experience has shown that young people and women must consistently pay attention to mobilizing and organizing them in the movement. To expand the results, it must be combined with the current reality (production). At present, the most important thing is to solve many difficulties in production, such as the lack of production tools and production capital, etc. They must be properly organized to use these fruits after the peasants receive them. (The work of expanding the results is still in progress.)

V. Several Issues That the Work Team Must Adhere To

First, the issue of work style. Regarding the old work style, there is a historical tradition. For example, beating people and hanging people are brought from the old society. It must be understood that hanging people and beating people are not the real demands of the masses. The leadership must take a firm attitude to correct this old work style. This is not pouring cold water. Two issues must be paid attention to in establishing a new work style: One is extreme democracy. Often, if one person does not agree, they emphasize that their thinking is not clear. It must be pointed out that this extreme democracy actually destroys democracy. The second is that new cadres, in view of the undemocratic practices of the old cadres in the past, dare not make decisions on anything, no matter how big or small, they ask the masses. If one person raises an opinion, they dare not do it.

Second, the issue of policy. The land conference opposed the right, which was absolutely necessary. However, later, in implementation, it became a one-sided emphasis on the poor peasants and hired laborers, not giving a share to the landlords, not leaving a share to the rich peasants, forcing the middle peasants, not compensating the losses of the middle peasants, etc. The understanding of the policy was extremely unclear. This is mainly a problem of the thinking of the comrades of the work team, who became the tail of the masses. The leadership must insist that whatever is stipulated in the policy must be resolutely implemented. Therefore, what needs to be done and what does not need to be done, the policy boundaries must be clear.

Third, the issue of attitude towards branch party members. Generally, before the masses rise up, they abstractly hate the branch party members, always feeling that the branch party members are bad. After the masses rise up, the masses have been able to distinguish which are correct opinions and which are retaliatory opinions, but some comrades follow the retaliatory opinions and go towards blind anti-party emotions. Experience has shown that in party rectification, we must adopt the policy of striving for education and transformation towards party members, we must objectively distinguish between right and wrong and the severity of the situation, we must be strict, and at the same time, we must point out the way out for the party members and cadres. It is precisely because it is very strict but also points out the way out, so all the party members have been rescued. There is neither one who committed suicide and ran away, nor one who was expelled from the party. Therefore, the party members and the masses are very happy and satisfied.

Fourth, the mass line must be based on the most urgent demands of the greatest majority and the highest interests of the masses. Leaving the urgent demands of the masses is an empty mass line. The masses cannot be mobilized either. Therefore, it must come from the masses. The most urgent issue in several villages is the issue of democracy and the issue of demanding to remove the hats of special agents. If you insist that this issue will be discussed later and first carry out the extraction and supplementation, the more you "do things" for the masses and the more you "educate" the masses, the more the masses will not enter your subjective circle. In addition, the opinions that come from the masses are not necessarily correct. For example, the masses demand to hang and beat the cadres and are unwilling to give the landlords a share, etc. Therefore, not distinguishing whether the opinions of the masses are correct or not, and accommodating the masses, running with the masses without principles, is tailism and giving up leadership. It is easier to overcome the first deviation at present, but it is more difficult to overcome the second deviation, because some working comrades often threaten the leadership with "the opinions of the masses."

　　武安九区试行整党、民主、填补运动的点滴经验
    晋冀鲁豫中央局土地会议后，张磐石同志率领的工作团，开始以太行武安九区赵庄为基点及其附近八个村进行工作。领导上主要参加赵庄取得经验随时指导附近各村。在群众初步组织起来后（一般是贫农团农会成立后）即抽调一部分干部向附近村庄采取波浪式推进，两个半月来，已向前推进了三次，逐渐取得经验。共进行了十五个村，一般均已大抵完成整党、民主、填补工作。
　　一、工作地区的一般情况及其特点
    武安九区从一九四○年成为游击根据地，四二年开始了减租减息，后经四五年查减及反奸清算，五四指示后的土改大运动，及填平补齐，挤封建割尾巴，封建已基本上被消灭；农民都取得了土地；支部成份亦好。但作风有毛病，强迫命令、独断专行、不民主，成为各村主要特点。由于领导上的官僚主义，可以说上级越是认为是好支部、问题越多。为争取模范村和完成任务，不管群众受得了受不了，封锁上边，统治下面，一般群众对干部的感觉是新石板。石洞、田二庄群众把干部称之为“一窝蜂”。村干部对群众的吊、打、捆、罚、骂非常严重，在群众中引起了不安。这种封建的吊打捆罚，土改前主要表现在对特务的逼供上；土改当中最严重的是去年春天的填补和去年秋天挤封建割尾巴中的挖地下宝；另外去年各地群众给干部洗脸擦黑后，干部的报复行为很普遍，两次解决干群关系，最后领导上也都是给干部撑腰做了结局。因而群众不敢轻易发言，不敢向干部提意见，但他们迫切地要求改造干部，实行民主。所以启发群众大胆说话，是极不容易的事。在工作团到村的初期，群众还多采取不信任的态度。
    在土地分配上，经仔细检查有几种不同情况：一是数量平，质量悬殊，如田二庄十六户贫农，平均地数高出全村平均数零点二亩，但村长支部书记二人的土地，等于十六户贫农所有的好地之总和。二是贫雇的地既远又零碎，做起活来费工多。三是从群众看每户都大体差不多，但干部却高出一般水平。
    各村封建虽已基本消灭，但斗争面很广，严重伤害了中农。斗争对象一般都占村中户数的四分之一，扫地出门的比重相当大。如固镇一百三十三户斗争对象中，有八十户被扫地出门。损害中农的原因，主要是定成份追三代，挤封建、挖防空洞，戴特务帽子，其中有的为亲戚或父兄弟妹所牵累，还有的是村干党员的趁机报复，往往有些积蓄即被斗争。赵庄牛头等村，中农被斗户一律被称为地主，数量几乎占全村被斗户的百分之九十。因此给这次填补工作造成了困难：未翻透身的贫雇的土地要求要满足，错斗中农要赔偿，还要给地主富农一份，干部多占土地总数不大，而每村均有一部分中农平均产量超过贫雇平均产量一倍以上，不动中农就很难填补起来。如果没有坚强的领导，很难不再犯侵犯中农利益的错误。
    该区过去工作基础一般是好的，党员干部的成份多数是贫雇，没有发现一个地主富农党员。但由于干部党员的作风太坏，斗争地主富农也是少数积极分子冲锋，使百分之十到百分之三十的老实贫雇没有翻透身。经过这次运动，各村发现了不少老实贫雇是很能干的，如河西村五个贫农团委员，都是过去从来不敢吭气，没上台说过话的人，其中两三人在这次运动中表现比过去的干部党员都能干，都正派。赵庄新选的贫农团委员农会委员和村政府委员中有几个贫雇为全村群众所拥戴，过去都长期未露过面。所以在上述地区的大村有时还要组织贫农团，不组织贫农团时，也要特别注意发动这一底层，并保证他们在这次无论如何要翻身。
　　二、整编队伍
    因为党员干部在村里的统治很严密，如果不先整编党和群众队伍，就不能发现问题，也不能进行工作。因此首先是在群众中发扬民主，以便发现中心问题，整编也因而分成两个阶段：
    第一阶段放手发扬民主、发现问题、发现积极分子。
    工作团一到村，一部分人就住在贫雇农和中农家里，在群众中广泛宣传这次来是干什么的，同时并进行个别访问，着重贫雇，也包括中农和党员，征求他们对过去工作和干部有什么意见。开始时老实贫雇是不敢讲话的，怕和去年“洗脸擦黑”一样，再遭受干部的报复。因之，即向他们说明这次决不象过去“洗脸擦黑”，一定给群众撑腰到底；同时工作人员和他们生活在一起，逐渐取得他们的相信，打破他们的顾虑，他们亦就谈了真心话。工作团的另一部分人，到村后即召开支部会，把民主整党填补，给他们讲清，说明党脱离群众的危险性，过去支部脱离群众的错误有些是应该由上级负责的，对党员教育不够，分配任务不合实际，以致形成强迫命令等。有些则应由党员自己负责。为了广大人民利益，现在要解决这个问题，说明要在群众中公开党，征求他们有什么意见。一般他们是没有什么意见的，因为他们懂得上级这一套，每次都说得很厉害，以后马马虎虎也就完了。后来有些村的党员听到别的村整党情形，知道不整不行，反省态度也就比较老实。至于公开党，过去只公开几个好党员，这次要全部公开，坏党员虽不愿意，但也无理反对。
    党员与群众都做了思想准备之后，就召开村民大会，宣布支部要进行整顿，进行反省听候审查，干部照常工作，不许消极怠工；动员大家对干部和过去的工作提意见，帮助整党，并说明这次一定要根据群众意见把工作做好。大会上把党员名单公开了，说明党员应该干些什么，请大家看看过去这个村的党员是不是这样，但不能打架不许动手打人。在会上，同时动员划阶级，说明划定每个人的阶级之后，就不会被乱斗，乱斗了的还可以改正，多得果实的要退，没有翻透身的要补，错斗的要补偿。这样大家就有了民主地位了，政治上生活上就有了保障，这次会参加的人特别多，很多人想试探一下工作团的态度到底怎么样。会后党员、干部与群众都有很大震动，但是还有点怀疑，党员说：“是不是会真的这样办？”群众说：“不可不信，也不可全信！”
    接着划阶级，首先工作团在村里研究了一些类型，并试划了几个贫雇，在划的时候先讲阶级，举本村的实例做详细的解释，开始划时比较慢，后来群众熟练了就划得很快，他们说：“过去划阶级没有个准头，尺子在干部口袋里，他说啥就是啥。这次有了尺子，拿在大家手里，是长是短，划起来就方便了。”普遍感觉这次办法简单、公平、容易懂、特别是中农感到满意，富裕中农说：“这可好了，咱总不是地主富农。”大家感觉“这是奖励劳动咧。”有些新翻身的贫雇感觉一年就转为新中农，底子虚，有困难。一般是老中农愿意划成新中农，新中农愿意划成贫农。为此争得面红耳赤，互相比较、互相揭发、非常认真。工作团对于群众这种争论一般是鼓励的，以便弄清实况，但因为强调民主（这是对的），一部分人老是说思想不通，比生活、比历史、比政治、比态度等等都有，纠缠时间很长，领导上即从中不断坚持原则，引导群众到正确方面，强调是啥就是啥，才纠正了各种偏向。
    有的地方在划阶级中把斗争对象、干部党员和群众一块划，但因为这三部分人不很融洽，在一块说话不方便，一般是分开来划，或先划群众和党员干部，然后大家给斗争对象划阶级。在划斗争对象时，初步订正了斗错的。谈到特务问题时，强调由本人声辩，让群众审查摘掉帽子，没有证据，没有经上级的处理，不能乱给人戴帽子，弄不清的，把材料送给上级处理，村里不能随便决定谁是特务。
    这以后，就动员群众给干部党员提意见，干部党员不参加（以便群众大胆说话），提完意见，请群众选代表，到支部里去提，接着就召开支部大会，由工作团和支部并请群众代表参加，组成整党委员会或叫主席团，这样，便于把了解群众与党员的情况结合起来，群众代表参加主席团，可以维持秩序，不致于打架。在这个会上，只让群众代表给党员干部提意见，党员干部暂时不作声辩（声明以后是有权利申辩的），一则避免威胁群众不敢讲话，再则避免激怒群众打起架来。这时候要放手让群众提意见，不要怕报复分子的意见，因为老实群众还不敢讲话，他们明知报复分子并不比某些党员干部好，但他们愿意叫报复分子替他们出气、同时报复分子所提的意见，大多是事实（可能分量上有些夸大）。这样会议之后，党员大吃一惊，感觉群众意见远超过他自己所反省的，对党员反省推动很大，而老实农民则感到报复分子不正派、不如他们自己提意见好。
    经过个别访问划阶级，已经串连了一部分老实贫雇，组织了贫农小组，此时即在支部内号召贫雇党员谁愿到贫雇小组进行反省，要求参加贫雇小组谁就去，结果有些党员自己觉着有把握就去参加，去的人都被认为可以参加贫雇小组，也可以做个党员。那些被通过的党员回到党内就开展了批评与自我批评，分清了好党员坏党员的界限，分化了支部的“一窝蜂”。
    这时群众已经起来了，老实正派的积极分子也涌现出来了，党员的好坏以及错误的轻重也弄清了。但在这一阶段内，工作团对这村的问题，对党员好坏，不应该预先有固定的看法。
    整编队伍的第二阶段：组织起来。
    群众出了气之后，就要求组织起来当家，在贫雇农多的地方，为了避免与中农的分裂，贫农团可不组织或组成贫农团后，马上就串连中农，成立新农会。在贫雇农少的地方，可以贫农小组为基础，串连中农，直接改选农会，但必须保证贫雇能够选到农会委员会里去，以便保证贫雇的利益。新农会委员中，如没有中农或中农太少，贫雇一般应让出三分之一的位置给中农。农会成立之后，大的村庄选举农代会，中小村庄一般的直接选举村政府委员。在组织起来的过程中，群众鉴于过去的经验——自己没有当了家，选了坏人当干部，因此这次是十分认真的。首先入团入会的条件开始很严格，如说劳动不好不要，流氓不要等。但领导上要及时克服关门主义倾向。群众的意见是先扎好根，再教育有毛病的让他改正后参加，一般的全村都进行了批评与自我批评，然后逐渐入会。农民间经过批评与自我批评后，在选举时选的都是好人，好的党员也被选了。但报复分子不正派的人，虽然他们再三活动，却没有被选上。但有一点应该注意，无论是整党、或整编群众队伍，群众都强调好人，实际是一种超阶级的观点，工作团应该清醒，说明好人不仅是正派劳动，还要阶级分明。
    在贫农团成立时通过一部分党员参加后，成立新农会时又通过了一部分党员，参加新农会并认为可以做党员。党内批评与自我批评更加开展。但有一部分党员（约占三分之一，一般是当权干部），仍未能通过，他们感到压力很大，没有出路；同时，已经通过的党员，由于他们思想上尚未完全解决问题，旧作风一时未能全部改过来，也在农会与贫农团中碰了些钉子，这些人很容易被通不过的党员所拉拢，又变成“一窝蜂”。这时候领导上就要给党员更多的热情和安慰，主要是指出出路。说明只要反省的好，群众就能原谅；只要改正错误，就有出路。另外，工作团召集贫农团与农会委员，和他们商量，问他们以为通不过的党员干部应该怎么办？他们问党内有什么办法，经说明党内犯错误的是分别轻重，予以处分，如劝告、警告、留党察看、开除等等。他们同意这个办法，但一般定的处分很重，并声明他们还没有办交代，帐还未算清，这个处分还不能作最后确定。至此，群众的队伍已经编好了，但党的队伍还须要结合下一阶段的抽补工作，才能整完；因为党群关系中若干事实尚未最后辨明，群众对党员的气愤还未减消，如果过早的结束整党，一定处分的面很宽而且很重。
　　三、进行抽补，贯彻民主，结合抽补的实践，完成整党。
    首先是新旧干部办交代，主要是清算帐目，接收果实。群众对这些事很关心，选举专人认真进行，我们要放手让群众算，明知有的帐算不清，也只好让他算，但有两件事应该注意，一是农民干部不识字，大多是帐目不清，由于过去不民主把帐目都丢了，二是过去果实保管不好，遗失难免。群众中还有一个错觉，就是把少数地主富农的果实，分散给全村大多数的农民，大家都感到地主东西很多，自己所得很少，因之以猜测代替事实，如说一个斗争对象有一付银镯子，那几十个斗争对象就应该有几十付呢！这样钻牛角尖，形成对党员干部的逼供，甚至主张非吊打不可，这时候领导上再不要强调单纯算清帐，要把算帐和接收果实结合起来。其次，最后审查斗争对象时，全村再划一次阶级，由旧干部讲过去为什么错斗了一些人，哪些是由于无知，哪些是为了报复，哪些是上级有公事叫斗的，把是非责任弄清楚，特别是对以特务名义被斗的，一定要负责的给人家摘掉帽子，还要把被斗者的历史情况介绍出来，有的村叫做“交代政治情况”。再次，抽丈土地，抽评产量，一般都有村本位思想，想把本村的土地产量弄少些，企图少出公粮，工作团提出各村负担不公，将来由区农代会县农代会来解决。目前主要是解决抽补问题，如果哪块地不公，即可抽丈抽评，求得大体公平即可，群众同意这个意见。但过去的不公，主要是旧干部为了减轻自己负担、和报复别人，因之群众要求旧干部参加抽丈抽评，让他们自己说出纠正，再加上群众公议，大体差不多了。再次，自报公议窟窿户，一般报的不实，对此不要有固定意见，反复发扬民主，让群众公议，互相揭发。这里应注意的，平均产量不要以全村人口除全村产量，应先将超过全村平均产量一倍以上的老中农产量除去，这样平均产量就不会过高，窟窿户也不会过多。再次，自报公议“圪堆户”，说明多得果实者应当退，老中农是在对自己有利的条件下（如少出负担，种不过来等）自动让出土地，但应声明不是被斗户。党员干部退果实，应注意不要退得产量不够了。在退果实上一般党员干部表现很好，他们说：“宁要政治果实。”群众对此很受感动。再次，评议抽补，由于过去斗争面宽，而且大多是扫地出门，还有一部分贫雇没有翻透身，这样加起来，窟窿户就很大。而党员干部所多得部分合起来总数并不多。窟窿大，圪堆小，加上工作团一部分同志和群众思想上的“左”，其危险或者是不愿给斗争对象分一份，不愿赔偿被斗中农的损失，或者是硬挤中农往外拿东西，还有的要求政府救济。这主要是思想问题，实际上只要让农民自己讨论，在一般村是能够解决的。讨论中还要注意几个问题：一是反对绝对平均，应强调差不多就行；一是反对极端民主，应强调少数服从多数的原则，绝不能因为一个人不同意就改变。对中农也需要有必要的批评。强调斗错了赔偿，不要轻易允许“吃啥吐啥”，“原物归原主”。因为已经分了，只要赔偿相当一份就可以，有的中农赔偿后比他错斗前的产量还高。原物能还的就还，如田二庄还了牛和房子，固镇还了药铺，群众是满意的。最后，再开一次村民大会，在会上：一、宣布抽补结果；二、最后确定阶级；三、宣布党员处分；四、宣读任弼时同志“土地改革中的几个问题”（此文对群众政策教育意义极大），请大家依此作回顾检查本村工作。在这以前，还要召开一次支部会，并邀请群众代表参加。让党员声辩，哪些是自己的错，哪些是群众误会的，哪些是为了工作，哪些是自私，哪些上级应该负责，让群众代表们最后鉴定。因为党员干部在参加抽补时表现很好，所以群众的观感已经变了，要求对党员的处分面大大缩小，处分的程度也大大减轻，一般不主张开除或只开除一两个，他们强调“留在党内教育好”，例如赵庄群众说：“共产党的办法好，一层一层管的紧，不在这一层在哪一层，不行了再开除，这样冤枉不了人。”“开除个党员，就等于朝着心口眼打了一枪，可不要乱说，这不是个小事啊！”开始群众对打伤过人的干部党员，要求送人民法庭，但整党后，群众在政治上，经济上翻了身，出了气，党员干部除承认错误之外，又自动提出给抚恤费或帮助一部分劳动，群众感到这样自己解决比送人民法庭也并不坏。当经支部讨论上级批准后宣布党员处分时，群众是很满意的。在这个大会上，最后把生产工作作了动员。
　　四、扩大战果
    首先是整党问题，在筹备成立贫农团通过第一批党员以前，支部在群众中一时很少实际活动，通过第一批党员，参加贫农团之后，因为还有一部分党员未通过，所以支部生活仍不健全。抽补开始后，又开一次支部会，让大家对犯错误的原因和对上级党的意见以及对这次整党的意见都谈了，一般认为这次整党很严，但党始终在挽救他。赵庄党员李会则说：“可惜整党整的太迟了，早整两年，咱就不会犯这许多错误！”党员听明则说：“从这次整党里看出，党比俺亲爹娘还亲，过去俺要饭的时候，爹娘给俺一个碗，叫俺要饱了饭就算了。党不光叫我翻了身，还叫我走到正道上去。”大家检讨犯错误的原因，一个是脱离群众，不了解群众对他们有这许多意见，气愤这样厉害。一个是很多人入党时就糊涂，入党后党的生活很不健全，上级只是布置任务，很少甚至没有对党员进行教育和检查。因之要求上级考虑以后怎样给他们以教育；有些党员提议今后初一、十五为党日，除经常吸收群众参加支部会之外，两三个月征求一次群众意见，今后政治主任取消，党不再命令群众，但为了实现党的领导，支部必须经常布置与检查党员在群众中的活动。群众中有些不团结特别是闹宗派，还必须再清算一次，一定把所有的宗派拆散，强调阶级团结。
    在运动中，青年与妇女的活动受了些限制。往往青年在年老人面前不敢讲话，妇女在男人面前讲话更困难。因此青年和妇女在农会中应有他们单独的组织。经验证明，青年和妇女必须在运动中一贯的注意发动组织他们。扩大战果，必须与目前实际（生产）相结合。目前最重要的是解决生产上的许多困难，例如缺乏生产工具、生产资本等，必须在农民收到果实之后，适当的组织他们运用这些果实。（关于扩大战果工作，现仍在进行中。）
　　五、工作团必须坚持的几个问题
    第一、作风问题。关于旧作风，是有历史传统的，例如打人吊人，这是旧社会带来的。必须了解吊人打人并不是群众的真正要求，领导上要采取坚决态度纠正这种旧作风，这并不是泼冷水。在建立新作风上必须注意两个问题，一是极端民主，往往一个人不同意，即强调思想不通，必须指出这种极端民主实际上破坏民主。二是新干部鉴于过去旧干部的不民主，因此不论什么事情都不敢作主，事无大小，都去问群众，有一个人提意见，他就不敢干了。
    第二、政策问题。土地会议反了右，这是完全必要的。但后来，在执行上，弄成片面的强调贫雇，不给地主一份，不给富农留一份，硬动中农，不赔偿中农损失等，对政策的了解极不明确，这主要是工作团同志的思想问题，作了群众的尾巴。领导上必须坚持，凡是政策上所规定的必须坚决贯彻。所以什么需要做，什么不需做，政策界限必须要分明。
    第三、对待支部党员态度问题。一般是群众未起来以前，抽象的憎恶支部党员，总觉支部党员坏。群众起来后，群众已经能分辨哪是正确意见，哪是报复意见了，有些同志却跟着报复意见走，走向盲目反党情绪上去。经验证明：在整党中，对待党员必须采取争取教育改造的方针，必须客观的分别是非轻重，必须严格，同时又要给党员干部指出出路。正因为很严格但又指出出路，所以整个党员都得到挽救，既没有一个自杀逃跑的，也没有一个被开除党籍的，因此党员和群众都很快乐满意。
    第四、群众路线必须是根据群众最大多数最高利益的迫切要求，离开了群众的迫切要求就是空洞的群众路线。群众也发动不起来。因此必须从群众中来。若干村庄最迫切是民主问题，是要求摘掉特务帽子的问题，如硬说这问题以后再说，先来抽补罢，这样越给群众“办事”，越“教育”群众，群众越不上你的主观圈子。另外，群众中来的意见，不一定都是正确的，如群众要求吊打干部，不愿给地主一份等，因此不辨别群众意见正确与否，迁就群众，无原则的跟着群众跑，就是尾巴主义，就是放弃领导。目前克服第一偏向还较易，而克服第二偏向则较难，因为有些工作同志常常是以“群众意见”来威胁领导。
