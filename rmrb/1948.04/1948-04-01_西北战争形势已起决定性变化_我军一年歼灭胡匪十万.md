Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, March 30th: The Frontline Headquarters of the Northwest People's Liberation Army issued a comprehensive report on March 19th regarding the first anniversary of our army's voluntary withdrawal from Yan'an, stating that the Hu Zongnan bandit troops had suffered a total loss of forces equivalent to more than 52 regiments, reaching a total of 100,000. In just one year, the war situation has undergone a decisive change. On this day last year, Hu Zongnan recklessly advanced with his elite troops, arrogantly boasting for a time. But on this day this year, our army launched a major offensive, achieving a major victory in Yichuan in early March, annihilating 30,000 enemies. Following this with unstoppable momentum, we liberated Huangling (中部), Yijun, Baishui, Huanglong counties along the Xian-Yu Road, recovered ＠county, Ganquan, and surrounded Luochuan, leaving the Hu bandit troops facing collapse. This situation indicates that the recovery of Yan'an and the liberation of the Northwest are not far off. As pointed out in the Xinhua News Agency editorial "The Turning Point of the War" in early March last year: "Chiang's army's occupation of Yan'an will mark the demise of Chiang Kai-shek, and the People's Liberation Army's abandonment of Yan'an will mark the victory of the Chinese people."

The comprehensive battle results of our field army in one year are as follows:

(1) The annihilation of enemy regular troops above the level of a full company (all calculated based on the reorganized establishment) included one army headquarters (the entire 29th Army headquarters), five division headquarters (the entire 81st Division, the entire 36th Division, the entire 76th Division, the entire 27th Division, the entire 90th Division), six brigade headquarters (the entire 31st Brigade twice, the entire 24th Brigade twice, the entire 167th Brigade, the entire 47th Brigade), seven entire brigades (the entire 135th Brigade, the entire 31st Brigade, the Provisional 60th Brigade, the entire 123rd Brigade, the entire 165th Brigade, the entire 53rd Brigade, the entire 61st Brigade), fifteen entire regiments (the 91st and 92nd Regiments of the 31st Brigade, the 499th Regiment of the 167th Brigade, the 70th Regiment of the 24th Brigade twice, the 71st Regiment, the 256th and 257th Regiments of the 86th Division, the 2nd Regiment of the New 11th Brigade, the 3rd Regiment of the Cavalry 2nd Brigade, the 27th Regiment of the New 9th Brigade, the 158th Regiment of the 53rd Brigade, the 139th and 140th Regiments of the 47th Brigade, the 144th Regiment of the 48th Brigade), ten entire battalions, and nine entire companies.
