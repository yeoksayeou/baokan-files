　　[Taihang News] The Qizhuang large wooden bridge on the Zhangnan Canal in the First District of Shexian County had completely rotted by last year. Repairs began last autumn and have now been completed. The canal is over forty li long and irrigates more than 3,300 mu of land. Last year, during the drought prevention period, the large wooden bridge of the canal rotted completely due to age, cutting off the water source to the land of eight villages. After the autumn harvest, the masses of Nanzhuang and other eight villages, under the leadership of the Canal Committee, borrowed more than 70,000 jin of millet from the Administrative Office and the County Government to carry out a new bridge rebuilding and canal repair project. By the end of March this year, all seven wooden bridges of the main canal had been repaired, five sections were rebuilt as earthen canals, two were converted into stone bridges, and two large stone bridges were repaired. The silt in the canal was also completely removed. Now the main canal and branch canals have been completed. The water has been released into the canal a few days ago, and the masses are excitedly diverting water to irrigate the land and prepare for planting. The total cost of this project was more than 34,360 labor days, consuming more than 87,250 jin of millet and more than 6.26 million Jiao of Hebei currency.
