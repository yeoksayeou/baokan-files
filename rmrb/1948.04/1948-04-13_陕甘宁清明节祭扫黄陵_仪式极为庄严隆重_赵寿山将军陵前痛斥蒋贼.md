Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th: The ceremony for representatives of the Party, government, military, and laboring people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to pay respects at the Huangdi Mausoleum was extremely solemn and grand. On the morning of April 5th, Qingming Festival, people from all walks of life in Chengguan Town, Huangling County; the Huangling County government; the CCP County Committee; a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army; teachers and students of Huangling Normal School and its affiliated primary school; and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government's mausoleum tribute delegation, including Border Region Deputy Chairman Liu Jingfan, Northwest People's Liberation Army Deputy Commander Zhao Shoushan, and Political Department Director Gan Siqi, numbering over a thousand people, went to the mausoleum to pay their respects. The couplet "Recover the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum, sweep away the evil air of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan; Liberate all of China, establish a new democratic homeland" hung high on both sides of the pine forest. The sacrificial pavilion was filled with sacrificial dishes, wine, fruit, and wreaths; silver candles shone brightly, and incense smoke swirled. Looking around at the surrounding mountains guarding the site, and gazing up at the ancient cypresses reaching into the sky, the solemnity increased. The chief officiants, Liu Jingfan, Zhao Shoushan, and Gan Siqi, and the assistant officiants, including Yang Bolun, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Prefectural Committee representing the Guanzhong Sub-region; Li Sheng of the CCP Huangling County Committee representing the Huanglong Sub-region; Xu Wenli, Political Commissar representing a certain unit of the stationed troops; representatives of citizens; and representatives of government organs and schools, completed the sacrifice. General Zhao Shoushan then gave a speech. He first described the hardships of the Yellow Emperor's founding, and how, through the development of generations of working people, today's vast and beautiful land of China came to be. He then vehemently denounced the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, saying, "The people's enemy, Chiang Kai-shek, has cleanly sold all of China's sovereignty to the United States. His treasonous crimes surpass those of the great traitors Yuan Shikai and Wang Jingwei." They called on everyone to thoroughly eliminate the Chiang-Hu bandit gang and drive American imperialism out of China! Thoroughly eliminate the landlord class, equally distribute the land, so that everyone has food to eat and can live a good life. Following a group photo, the ceremony concluded amidst the simultaneous sound of saluting cannons and the playing of military music.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th: The sacred site of the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum, the ancestor of the Chinese nation, has been subjected to all kinds of destruction and desecration by his unfilial descendant, the Chiang bandits. The "Qunwu Sendai," about a hundred steps in front of the mausoleum, has been excavated and destroyed and constructed into a bunker. The ancient cypresses around the mausoleum have also been cut down and used for fortifications. The mausoleum grounds are full of artillery and machine gun positions and various trenches. The Yellow Temple has been converted into a barracks, and the doors and windows are broken and abandoned. Only a few pieces of wood remain of the shrines. The ancient steles in the courtyard have either been moved and used as desks or smashed to pieces. The ancient stele "Xuanyuan Huangdi Qiaoling" in front of the mausoleum has been destroyed. Moreover, the concubine of Cao Pinyu, the instructor of the 495th Regiment of the 165th Brigade of the Chiang bandits, was openly buried next to the Huangdi Mausoleum, with steles side by side, the stele shamefully inscribed with "Grave of the Late Mrs. Sun Shumin." However, on some other steles were angrily written in pencil "Those who destroy the Yellow Emperor Temple are not descendants of the Yellow Emperor" and "Down with the 127th Brigade, the brigade that burns temples." Now, the joint proclamation of the democratic government and the headquarters of the stationed troops is hung high in the mausoleum, clearly ordering the protection of all historical sites in the Yellow Emperor Mausoleum. Most of the various internal war fortifications of the Chiang bandits have also been cleared, but restoring the old appearance of the mausoleum may not be completed in a short period.

　　陕甘宁清明节祭扫黄陵
  　仪式极为庄严隆重
  　赵寿山将军陵前痛斥蒋贼
    【新华社西北十一日电】陕甘宁边区党政军代表及劳动人民祭谒黄陵仪式极为庄严隆重。四月五日清明节清晨，黄陵县城关各界人民，黄陵县县府、中共县委、解放军某部、黄陵师范和附小学生，及陕甘宁边区政府祭陵代表边府副主席刘景范，西北人民解放军代表副司令员赵寿山，政治部主任甘泗淇等千余人，纷赴陵园祭谒。“光复黄帝陵扫清蒋胡邪妖气，解放全中国建立民主新家邦”的对联高悬于松坊两旁。祭亭满陈祭菜酒醴果品花圈，银烛辉煌，香烟环绕，四望群山拱卫，仰瞻古柏参天，益增肃穆。主祭人刘景范、赵寿山、甘泗淇，陪祭人关中分区代表中共地委副书记杨伯伦，黄龙分区代表中共黄陵县委李生，驻军某部代表政治委员徐文礼，及市民代表、机关学校代表致祭毕，由赵寿山将军讲话，他首先叙说远祖黄帝创业的艰难，以及经过历代劳动人民的开拓，才有今天中国这一片广阔的锦绣河山。继即痛斥卖国贼蒋介石说：“人民公敌蒋介石把中国主权干干净净的全卖给美国了，他的卖国罪行赛过了大汉奸袁世凯、汪精卫。”他们号召大家彻底消灭蒋胡匪帮，把美帝国主义赶出中国去！彻底消灭地主阶级，平分土地，使人人有饭吃，过好光景。继于全体摄影后，在礼炮齐鸣军乐齐奏中宣告礼成。
    【新华社西北十一日电】中华民族始祖所在的黄陵圣地，遭到他的不肖子孙蒋匪的百般破坏亵渎。陵墓前约百步的“群武仙台”已被挖掘毁坏，构筑成一座碉堡。陵周古柏也横遭砍伐作了工事，陵园内到处修筑炮兵机枪阵地及各种战壕。黄庙被改作营房，门窗都已残破毁弃，神龛只剩下几根木头。院内古碑或被搬移当作了案桌或被打碎。陵墓前的“轩辕黄帝桥陵”古碑已遭毁坏。而蒋匪整一六五旅四九五团指导员曹品瑜的姨太太，竟公然埋在黄陵一旁，碑碣并列，碑上并可耻的刻着“民故夫人孙淑敏女士之墓”，但在另一些碑石上也有用铅笔写下的“破坏黄帝庙的不是黄帝子孙”，“打倒一二七旅烧庙旅”等激愤的字句。现在陵园里已高挂着民主政府和驻军司令部的联合布告，明令保护黄陵一切古迹，蒋匪各种内战工事也大多清除，但恢复陵园旧观，恐已非短期间可完成。
