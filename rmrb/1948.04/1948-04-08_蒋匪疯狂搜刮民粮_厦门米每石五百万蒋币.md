　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandits Frantically Seize Grain
  　Xiamen Rice Reaches 5 Million Chiang Coins Per Shi
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th] Compiled from various sources: Chiang Kai-shek bandits are frantically seizing military grain. The bandit Minister of Grain, Yu Feipeng, personally went to Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan and other provinces to urge the intensified extortion. After more than a month, he flew back to Nanjing on the 24th of last month. At the same time, the bandit "Ministry of National Defense" also ordered its Jiujiang (Hankou) Command to set up a "Grain Purchasing Committee," which was established at the beginning of last month, plotting to plunder folk food, stored grain, merchants' grain and the bandit provincial and county-level public grain at low prices; and organized armed grain robbery bandit teams, attempting to invade the edge of the liberated areas, rob farmers' grain, and instigate traitorous merchants to smuggle grain from the liberated areas. It is reported that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' thirty-sixth "grain year" (from October of last year to September of this year) extorted grain for the bandit army's consumption. The share of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "central government" in the land tax levied in kind and the requisition quota totaled 25,630,000 city dan of rice (including wheat and sorghum converted into rice); the "purchase" of provincial and county-level "public grain" and the low-price "purchase" of grain from various places totaled 8,230,000 city dan of rice and 5,072,000 city dan of wheat, equivalent to 7,153,000 city dan of rice. The total of the three is expected to plunder more than 41 million city dan of grain converted to rice. However, by the beginning of March, the actual grain received by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits was only 55 percent of its target, while the Chiang Kai-shek bandit military public grain required about 50 million dan of rice. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have decided to continue robbing and purchasing at low prices in various places, stipulating that each city dan of rice is only "priced" at 170,000 yuan, which is several to dozens of times lower than the market price.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th] The semi-official American Associated Press revealed that the price of rice in Xiamen, Fujian, reached an astonishing record of 5 million Chiang coins per dan on the 3rd of this month. In Zhangzhou (Longxi), a rice-producing area of ​​Fujian, some people have already starved to death.
    According to a dispatch from Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency on the 28th of last month, a serious grain shortage has also occurred in the Chaoshan area of ​​Guangdong.

　　蒋匪疯狂搜刮民粮
  　厦门米每石五百万蒋币
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合各方消息：蒋匪疯狂搜刮军粮，匪粮食部长俞飞鹏亲自出马向赣、湘、鄂、川等省督促加紧勒索，为时月余，已于上月二十四日飞返南京。同时匪“国防部”亦命令其九江（汉口）指挥所筹设“抢购粮食委员会”，已于上月初成立，阴谋贱价掠取民间食粮、积谷、商贩谷米及匪省县级公粮；并组织武装抢粮匪队，妄图侵入解放区的边缘地带，抢劫农民粮食，及唆使奸商将解放区粮食走私出口。据悉：蒋匪三十六年“粮食年度”（去年十月至今年九月）勒索粮食供匪军食用者，其田赋征实征借配额中归蒋匪“中央”部分，共为稻谷（包括折合为稻谷的小麦、高粱）二千五百六十三万市担；“收购”省县级“公粮”及向各地贱价“采购”粮食两项，共稻谷八百二十三万市担，小麦五百零七万二千市担，折合稻谷七百一十五万三千余市担。三者合计共拟搜刮民粮合稻谷四千一百余万市担。但三月初蒋匪实收粮食仅及其预定数额百分之五十五，而蒋匪军公粮共需稻谷五千万担左右，蒋匪已决定再向各地低价抢劫勒购，规定稻谷每市担只“给价”十七万元，低于市价数倍至数十倍。
    【新华社陕北五日电】美国半官方美联社透露：福建厦门本月三日米价每担涨达蒋币五百万元的惊人纪录。福建产米区漳州（即龙溪）已有若干人民饥饿而死。
    又据上月二十八日蒋匪中央社电：广东潮汕一带亦发生严重粮荒。
