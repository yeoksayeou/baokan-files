　　[**Local News**] After the establishment of the New Peasants' Association in Hedong Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, everyone has a deeper understanding of the fact that middle and poor peasants are one family, and the enthusiasm for production has gradually increased. Middle and poor peasants worked together to adjust the old mutual aid arrangements, reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of the past mutual aid groups. Some groups pointed out that the leadership was not active enough and did not care enough about everyone's production; some groups pointed out that the group leader led well and the work accounts were clear, etc. Mutual criticism was also carried out, and members could voluntarily switch groups. Currently, there are six mutual aid groups in the village, and they have officially started mutual aid production. In the previous period, because plowing and ditch digging did not require large groups for mutual aid, small mutual aid groups of two or three people were organized under the leadership of the large groups, which supervised and inspected the work. Zhang Shulin's group challenged other groups to complete ditch digging between January 25th and 28th of the lunar calendar. The whole group worked hard and completed all the ditch digging within four days. Meng Er's group had finished their farm work, and some people planned to go out and reclaim wasteland.

　　Middle and poor peasants in each mutual aid group are very united, and everyone solves difficulties together. This time, Kui Ju was allocated a few plots of land, but because he had no gardening tools for watering, he suggested not taking the land. Xue Chi said, "If you have difficulties, we will all solve them together. My family has a rope, I'll lend it to you first, and you can slowly acquire your own later." Some poor peasants lacked farm tools, and the middle peasants actively lent them.

　　The families of revolutionary soldiers are also very enthusiastic about production. Meng Xianxun, a 67-year-old man who is a new middle peasant (his son is a party member), often said at group meetings and general meetings, "I am in the fields every day, and I have finished all the farm work. The village should not provide cultivation on our behalf." The village authorities have assisted in cultivating land for other families of revolutionary soldiers and the widowed. They said, "This year will be faster and better!"

　　The twelve households who were wrongly labeled landlords had their civil rights restored immediately after class designation, and the masses filled and distributed houses and land to them. After getting houses and land, the wrongly labeled households were very active in production. Qing was happy and said, "I never dreamed that I could return to the old village and still get land. This government is really good and does not wrong anyone. I will dare to say anything in the future." Some wrongly labeled households have joined production mutual aid groups.

　　The whole village completed ditch digging on the second day of the second lunar month. Hemp seeds were all planted from January to the second day of the second lunar month. Some have already sprouted, the garlic has grown more than four inches high, pumpkins have also been sown, all the stubble land has been plowed, most of the flower fields have been plowed, and the manure has been delivered. Sowing can begin soon. Because the entire village is engaged in production with enthusiasm, everyone is clamoring in the streets to compete with other villages in production.

　　中贫农团结互助
  　河东刨堰送粪早完
  　错斗户得到房地积极生产
    【本报消息】武安九区河东村成立新农会后，大家对中贫农是一家有了进一步的认识，生产情绪逐渐高涨。中贫农一起，调整旧的互助，检讨了过去互助组的优缺点，有的组提出领导不积极，关心大家生产不够；有的组提出组长领导得好，工帐算得清等。互相间也进行了批评，并可自愿调换组。现全村共有六个互助组，已正式互助生产，前一时期因犁地刨堰不需要大组互助，于是在大组领导下组织二三人一组的小互助，由大组督促检查。张树林组向别组提出挑战，要在旧历一月二十五到二十八日完成刨堰，全组紧张生产，四天内全部完成了刨堰。孟二的组地里营生已做完，有的人就计划出去开荒。
    各互助组里中贫农都很团结，有了困难大家解决，这次填补给魁举几分园，他因无浇园家具，提出不要园地，雪池就说：“有困难咱大伙儿来解决，俺家有绳先借给你使用，以后再慢慢置。”有的贫农缺农具，中农就积极借给。
    抗属的生产也很起劲，六十七岁的老汉孟宪训，他是新中农（他儿子是党员），在小组会上及大会上常提出：“俺天天上地里受，地里营生啥也做完，村上可不要给俺代耕了”。其他抗属及孤寡的地，驻村机关大部已帮助代耕了。他们说：“今年可搞得又快又好！”
    十二户错斗户经划阶级后，马上恢复了公民权，填补中群众分给他们房子和地。错斗户得到房子和地后，生产都很积极，庆的高兴的说：“我做梦也没有想到能回到老庄，还拥护给了地，这时的政府真是一个好人也不冤枉，以后有啥话也敢说。”有的错斗户已参加了生产互助组。
    全村于旧历二月二日完成刨堰，大麻子正月到二月二日全部种上，有的现已出芽，蒜已长了四寸多高，南瓜也下了种，茬子地全部犁完，花地大部犁出，粪已送完，最近即可下种。由于全村生产搞得热火，大家就在街里圪嚷着要给别村比赛生产。
