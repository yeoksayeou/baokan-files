　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Reports from various sources: The Draper Economic Mission sent by U.S. imperialism to Japan and South Korea has returned to the United States on the 6th after three weeks of activity. During its stay in Japan, the delegation consulted with MacArthur and Marshall's main assistant, Kennan, to plan the acceleration of Japan's economic recovery, attempting to make it an important "fortress" for U.S. imperialism against the people of Asia. It is reported that on the day of its return to the United States, the delegation proposed a one-year appropriation of $220 million for the "reconstruction plan" for Japan and South Korea, and considered allocating another $400 million for Japan's "relief plan." Its specific recommendations for supporting the Japanese bandits are as follows: (1) Increase Japanese exports to six or seven times the current amount of 200 million yuan per year. (2) Increase Japanese industrial production for export, and use the foreign exchange earned to purchase raw materials and food. (3) Accelerate the production and export of Japanese textiles to compensate for the shortage of gold pounds and U.S. dollars. (4) Encourage Japan to increase the construction of merchant ships, so that the tonnage of Japanese merchant ships will increase from one million tons to approximately four million tons in the next five years. (5) Ship a large amount of raw materials to Japan. (6) Quickly resolve the issue of reparations to Japan. According to United Press reporter Hensley on the 3rd, the Draper Economic Mission and Kennan agreed that "further reparations must be virtually cancelled." To this end, after returning to the United States, the delegation made excuses, claiming that the number of excess industrial factories in Japan that could actually be used as reparations was not large. When Dr. Draper gave a speech on the 6th, he admitted that he also agreed with the recommendation made by the Stettinius Overseas Associates to the U.S. Department of the Army to "retain all industrial factories in Japan engaged in foreign warfare."

　　美帝积极扶持日本
  　妄图奴役亚洲人民
    【新华社陕北十四日电】各方讯：美帝派赴日韩之德莱柏经济代表团，经三周活动后，已于六日返抵美国。该代表团于留日期间，曾与麦克阿瑟及马歇尔主要助手凯南会商，策划加速复兴日本经济，妄图使之成为美帝在亚洲反人民的重要“堡垒”。据息：该代表团于返美之日，即提出一年拨款二亿二千万元之日韩“复兴计划”，并考虑对日另拨四亿元之“救济计划”。其扶植日寇之具体建议如下：（一）增加日本输出，较目前每年二亿圆数额多至六、七倍。（二）增加日本工业生产，以供对外输出，并以所得外汇转购原料与食粮。（三）加速日本纺织品之生产及出口，以弥补金镑及美元之不足。（四）鼓励日本增制商船，在今后五年内，使日本商船吨位自一百万吨增至约四百万吨。（五）以大量原料输日。（六）迅速解决对日赔偿问题。据美帝合众社记者亨斯利三日透露：德莱柏经济代表团与凯南协商结果，一致认为：“进一步的赔偿必须实际取消”。为此，该代表团返美后即制造借口称：日本过剩工业工厂实际可以充作赔偿物资之数不大。德氏六日发表谈话时供认：他也赞同斯揣克海外顾问公司向美陆军部所提“保留日本从事国外作战之一切工业工厂”的建议。
