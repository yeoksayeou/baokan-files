　　Tree Planting and Forest Protection in Various Parts of Taihang
    [Taihang News] A tree planting campaign is underway in various parts of Taihang. According to incomplete data from seventeen villages in Ping順, Licheng, Shexian, Wu'an, Shahe, and Zanhuang counties, more than 63,000 trees have been planted, including 36,900 production trees such as soft jujubes (which can be grafted with persimmons), walnuts, Chinese prickly ash, peaches, and pears. This is the most significant characteristic of this year's tree planting efforts. Wild mountain products are a major source of income in the third district of Ping順. Due to frost damage last year, many trees died, so this year, 150,000 trees (five per person) will be planted to compensate for last year's losses. Of the 23,000 trees planned for planting in the fourth district, over 19,000 are production trees. In Weichi'ao Village in the seventh district, when discussing the benefits of planting production trees, the masses said, "If our ancestors hadn't planted persimmon trees and given us roasted flour, we would have starved to death during the famine years, how could we have survived to this day?" After the meeting, the entire village immediately launched the tree planting campaign, ensuring that each person planted and kept alive five trees. In Houchi Village in Shexian, the soil is thin and rocky. The masses said, "We must plant more soft jujube trees to become prosperous." They have already planted 1,420 trees. The Xingtai Municipal Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has dispatched personnel to guide the tree planting campaign in 25 villages along the Shahe River. The area plans to plant at least 70,000 trees. Han Village is surrounded by rivers on all sides. Under the slogan of "Planting more trees can prevent floods," the masses have planted 6,500 trees. Villager Han Fu alone planted 200 trees. Regarding the protection of trees, everyone has reviewed the past shortcomings of only planting trees and not nurturing them. Some have even established forest management committees. In Dongzhao Village, Huguan, a total of more than 1,400 trees were planted in the past two years, but only seventeen survived. After reviewing last year's shortcomings, the masses elected the production director and two activists to form a forest protection committee to lead the protection of the trees, and stipulated that whoever plants a tree must be responsible for protecting it. In Huili, Shexian, Xincun, Licheng, and other places, some have added a forest protection section to the production committee to prevent tree damage.

　　太行各地
  　植树护林
    【太行消息】太行各地掀起植树运动。据平顺、黎城、涉县、武安、沙河、赞皇等县十七个村不完全材料，已栽树六万三千余棵，其中有三万六千九百棵是软枣（能接柿树）、核桃、花椒、桃梨果等生产树。这是今年植树中一个最大特点。平顺三区山货是很大一项收入，因去年风霜死去不少，今年要植十五万棵（每口五棵），补助去年损失。四区两万三千棵的植树计划中，有一万九千余棵是生产树。七区苇池凹村，群众讨论栽生产树的好处时说：“要不是咱们祖先给栽下柿树，有了炒面，灾荒年早就饿死了，那能活到今天”。会后，全村的栽树运动马上搞起来，保证每个人栽活五棵。涉县后池村石厚土薄，群众说：“咱多多种些软枣树，才能发家致富。”已种一千四百二十棵。邢市农林局已派专人指导沙河沿岸二十五个村的植树运动，该地最少计划要栽树七万棵。韩庄村四面临河，群众在“多栽树木能防水”的口号下，已栽了六千五百棵，村民韩富一个人便栽了二百棵。各地在保护树株上，大家对过去光栽树不养树的缺点，都做了检讨，有的并成立了植树造林管理委员会。壶关东赵村过去二年一共栽了一千四百多棵，只活了十七棵。群众在检讨了去年的缺点后，今年便推选了生产主任和两个积极分子，专门成立了护林委员会领导护林；并规定今后不管谁栽的，都要负责保护。涉县会里，黎城辛村等地，有的在生产委员会中增加了护林股，以便保护树木不受损失。
