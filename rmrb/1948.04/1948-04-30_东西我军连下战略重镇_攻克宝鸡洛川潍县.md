    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, Urgent Telegram, 27th: Baoji City, a strategic town in the Northwest, the intersection of the Longhai Railway and the Xi'an-Baoji and Sichuan-Shaanxi highways, and the old nest of the Hu bandits in the rear, was captured by our Northwest People's Liberation Army on the 26th at 8:00 AM. All the defending enemies were annihilated. Baoji is an important military and industrial center in the Northwest. After our army captured the city, the military resources, weapons, and ammunition seized were piled up like mountains. Detailed battle results are being investigated. Since the advancement of our army into the fertile fields of the Jing and Wei rivers, ten cities have been captured in ten days, successively cutting off the transportation lifeline of the Jiang-Hu bandit army such as the Xi'an-Lanzhou and Xi'an-Baoji highways and the Longhai Railway. Wherever the army went, it conquered cities and annihilated enemies with irresistible force. According to statistics since the spring offensive, the Northwest People's Liberation Army has successively recovered and liberated twenty-one cities.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, Urgent Telegram, 27th: Following the recovery of the democratic holy land of Yan'an, the Northwest People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to pursue the fleeing enemy and liberated Luochuan City, 250 miles south of Yan'an, on the afternoon of the 25th. This city is an important passage on the Yan'an-Xianyang road. Before March of last year, it had been a base for the Jiang-Hu bandit army to invade the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and also an important stronghold for Jiang's party's secret agents to sabotage the Border Region. After the liberation of the city by our army, the newly established Huanglong Sub-district has been completely liberated and connected with the Guanzhong Sub-district.

Battle results are being investigated.
