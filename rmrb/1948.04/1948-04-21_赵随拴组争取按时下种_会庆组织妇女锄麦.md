　　【Ping Shun News】After repeatedly studying the Border Region Government's proclamation of "whoever sows, reaps," the production enthusiasm of Zhao Suishuan's First Production Brigade in Jiebian Village, Sixth District, has been further enhanced, and no one is slacking off. The brigade has a total of forty-three households, divided into four teams, with twenty-six male full laborers, eleven semi-laborers, thirty-nine female full laborers, and twelve semi-laborers. Production achievements from the beginning of the second lunar month to the end of the month (one month in total): women spun 294.5 jin of cotton, wove 148 chi of cloth, and stored 273.5 jin of thread. The brigade has six looms, led by poor peasants Guo Sanni and Zhang Gaiguo, and are currently weaving cloth in large quantities. The men are led by poor peasants Zhang Jintang, Sang Tiancun, and middle peasant Zhao Suishuan. They plan to plant 60.05 mu of Codonopsis pilosula, and have already sown 30.05 mu, with 30 mu not yet sown (to be sown within three to five days). They have delivered 11,700 dan of fertilizer. They have sown 5.8 mu of radishes, 18 mu of turnips, transplanted 257 saplings of timber trees, 405 saplings of fruit trees, cut 8,000 jin of firewood, built 24 zhang of embankment, 7 chi high, and cultivated 4 mu of land. On April 12th, they summarized their production achievements and arranged for sowing and living arrangements. They are now harrowing the land, leveling the edges, chopping embankments, leveling slopes, and sowing seeds. They will start leveling the ground and sowing seeds at Grain Rain, striving to sow on time and earlier rather than later. (Wang Dequan, Guo Cuncai)
　　
　　【Yangcheng News】The villages of Huiqing and Yingchao in the First District have organized women to go to the fields to weed because there has been a lot of spring rain this year, and there is a lot of grass in the wheat fields, but the men are too busy to handle it all. Lu Xiaochun's team in Huiqing Village was the first to organize, and in four days from the 10th to the 14th, they weeded 22 mu of wheat and 2 mu of spring land. They take care of both the home and the fields, getting up early to weed for half a day before coming back for a meal, and then spinning cotton, weaving cloth, and doing odd jobs at home after the meal. They have weeded 4 mu of wheat for military dependents Gao Dengshi and 4.5 mu of wheat for war support laborer Guo Xiaoshuang. When resting in the fields, they also kept track of the work points. After returning home, they recorded the work points. In this way, the women of Huiqing, Wang Qiumiao, Wang Xiaojun, etc., also quickly organized to weed the wheat. Yingchao Village also organized ten women's teams, with thirty-six people, and eleven children's teams. In just four days from the 10th to the 13th, the children weeded 91.5 mu of wheat, and the women weeded 28.8 mu of wheat.
