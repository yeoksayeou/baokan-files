　　International Week
    (April 5th to 11th)
    This week, the American people continued to denounce the reactionary policies of American imperialism. The "China Week" movement, opposing the Truman administration's aid to Chiang Kai-shek, swept across all major cities in the United States. Tens of thousands of people, filled with great friendship for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, signed petitions to the US government and Congress, loudly demanding that the Chinese people be allowed to solve their own problems and that the United States withdraw all aid to the Chiang bandits. Large-scale demonstrations held in various places roared, "US troops get out of China!" "No weapons for Chiang Kai-shek!" At a demonstration in New York, Smedley Butler denounced the Chiang bandit government as a "fascist government ruled by warlords," just like fascist Spain. The masses at the meeting booed the "Central News Agency reporter" sent by the Chiang bandits to scout the scene, calling him a "Kuomintang special agent." These reflect the deep-seated hatred of the American people for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Another manifestation of the growing strength of the American people's movement to defend peace and democracy is the formal establishment of the Wallace presidential campaign committee in New York State, with tens of thousands of people joining the peace and democracy camp in the past three weeks. In addition, the nationwide strike of 400,000 miners has persisted for four weeks. Despite Truman's issuance of a fascist-style strike ban, the miners completely ignored it and continued their heroic struggle. Moreover, 6,000 miners in eastern Pennsylvania also joined the strike on the 6th. The strike has severely hurt the big American capitalists. As of the 5th, US steel production had been reduced to 65% of its capacity.
    Amidst the torrent of the American people's movement, the US Congress, violating the will of the people, passed the so-called "Foreign Aid Bill," attempting to use it to enslave Europe and China and prevent the rise of the democratic movements of the European and Chinese people. However, the facts eloquently demonstrate that this so-called "Foreign Aid Bill" precisely exposes the "outward strength but inward weakness" of American imperialism and the "futility" of its results. The "European Recovery Program" in the "Foreign Aid Bill" was formally proposed to Congress by Truman in early December last year, originally with a total of 17 billion US dollars over four years. After nearly four months of endless disputes, it has now been reduced to 5.3 billion for one year. The aid to Chiang Kai-shek case was also reduced from 570 million for 15 months, proposed in mid-February, to the current 463 million for one year. The clamor for intensified aid to Chiang Kai-shek began as early as July last year, when the butcher of the Chinese people, Wedemeyer, came to China. The fact that the time spent was so long, and the amount and duration of the "aid" were greatly reduced compared to before, fully proves that American imperialism is just a paper tiger, both timid and lacking the ability to do what it wants.
    The "futility" of this "Foreign Aid Bill" is first and foremost proven in the aid to Chiang Kai-shek. As the famous American Far East expert Lattimore said: American aid will definitely "not stop the collapse of the Nanjing government." After the war, American imperialism gave the Chiang bandits more than 4.6 billion US dollars, and the result was the great offensive of the People's Liberation Army and the impending collapse of Chiang Kai-shek. Even the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, when passing this aid, had to lament: "The United States cannot guarantee the fate of China (Chiang Kai-shek)."
    "Aid" to Greece is just like aid to Chiang Kai-shek. After the war, US and British "aid" to the small Greek dynasty has reached 900 million US dollars, and the result has been to "aid" a Greek Provisional Democratic Government and a national counter-offensive by the Democratic Army. Recently, the Greek People's Liberation Army has won brilliant victories in central and eastern Macedonia, as well as Epirus, basically and comprehensively destroying the "spring offensive" launched under the direct command of American imperialism. Now, the total amount of aid to Turkey in the US "Foreign Aid Bill" is only 275 million US dollars, which of course cannot save the inevitable demise of the Greek puppet government.
    One of the focuses of the "European Recovery Program" - Italy - the people are responding to the American imperialists' help to the Italian reactionaries with a resolute support for the election campaign of the People's Democratic Front led by the Italian Communist Party. Despite the American imperialists and the Italian reactionaries using all kinds of intimidation, deception, and provocation to weaken the election campaign of the progressive forces, Italian Communist leader Togliatti said with confidence: "No violent actions can stop the democratic forces from winning the election." Togliatti particularly pointed out that the working masses in the southern provinces of Italy are currently united with the progressive democratic parties for a "decisive turning point in the history" of Italy.
    The signing of the Soviet-Finnish Ten-Year Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance is also a noteworthy event this week. This is "another great achievement in the Soviet Union's struggle for peace and security in all countries" (Izvestia); the international reactionaries' plot to turn Finland into an instrument of aggression has been shattered.
    In the Far East, Japanese workers are defying MacArthur's strike ban, and the strike wave continues one after another. Workers, peasants, sailors, university faculty, and civil servants in India are rising up in strikes, hunger strikes, and protests to oppose the anti-democratic policies of the Indian authorities, especially the reactionary measures of declaring the Indian Communist Party illegal and arresting democratic figures en masse.

　　国际一周
    （四月五日至十一日）
    这一周，美国人民继续讨伐美帝的反动政策。反对杜鲁门政府援蒋的“中国周”运动，遍及全美各重要城市，成千成万的人，充溢着支援中国人民解放事业的伟大友情，签字于致送美政府与国会的请愿书上，大声要求让中国人民自己解决自己的问题，撤回美国对蒋匪的一切援助。各地举行的盛大示威集会，怒吼着“美军退出中国！”“不给蒋介石武器！”在纽约的示威大会上，斯沫特莱痛斥蒋匪政府和法西斯西班牙一样，“是军阀统治的法西斯政府”，到会群众对蒋匪派往会场刺探的“中央社记者”，嘘之以“国民党特务”。这些反映了美国广大人民对蒋介石匪帮是何等深恶痛绝。保卫和平民主的美国人民运动日益壮大的另一表现，就是纽约州华莱士竞选总统委员会已正式成立，最近三周内又有好几十万人涌入和平民主阵营。此外，四十万矿工的全国性大罢工，坚持已达四周，尽管杜鲁门发出法西斯式的罢工禁令，但矿工们丝毫不加理睬，仍英勇的继续斗争，而且宾州东部的六千矿工也于六日走进了罢工的行列。罢工已重重地打痛了美国大资本家，截至五日为止的统计，美国钢产量已减至其生产力的百分之六十五。
    在美国人民运动的狂澜中，美国会违反民意而通过了所谓“援外法案”，妄图借此奴役欧洲与中国，阻止欧洲与中国人民民主运动的高涨。然而事实却雄辩地说明：这一所谓“援外法案”又恰好暴露了美帝“外强中干”及其结果的“无济于事”。所谓“援外法案”中的“欧洲复兴方案”，系去年十二月初旬即由杜鲁门正式向国会提出，原定四年总额一百七十亿美元，经过近四个月之久的争吵不休，现又减缩成一年的五十三亿。援蒋案也由二月中旬所提之十五个月的五亿七千万，减缩成现在一年的四亿六千三百万，而加紧援蒋的叫嚣，则自去年七月间中国人民的屠夫魏德迈来华时，即已开始喧嚷。花费的时间既如此之长，“援助”款额的数量和期限又均较前大为减少，这充分证明美帝只是一只吓唬人的纸老虎，既胆怯且又心有余而力不足。
    这一“援外法案”的“无济于事”，首先反证在援蒋上。正如美国著名远东专家罗辛格所说：美援决“不能阻止南京政府的崩溃进程”，战后美帝已给了蒋匪四十六亿余美元，结果是人民解放军实行大进攻与蒋贼的濒于崩溃。这次四亿余元的援蒋，就连美参院外委会在通过此项援助时，亦不得不哀鸣：“美国不能保证中国（蒋匪）之命运”。
    “援助”希腊亦一如援蒋一样，战后美英对希腊小王朝的“援助”已达九亿美元，其结果却援助出了一个希腊临时民主政府以及民主军的全国大反攻。最近希腊人民解放军又在马其顿中部和东部，以及爱匹鲁斯等地获得了辉煌的胜利，基本上全面的摧毁了美帝直接指挥下所发动的“春季攻势”。现在美国“援外法案”中的援助希土贷款，总数仅二亿七千五百万元，当然更挽救不了希腊伪政府必然覆灭的命运。
    “复兴欧洲法案”中的一个重点——意大利，人民正以坚决拥护意共领导的人民民主阵线的竞选运动，作为对美帝帮助意国反动派的响亮回答。尽管美帝及意大利反动派用尽种种威吓欺骗和挑衅手段，企图削弱进步力量的竞选运动，但意共领袖托格里亚蒂满怀信心的说：“任何暴力行动都阻止不了民主势力要获得选举胜利”。托氏特别指出：意南各省的劳苦大众，目前正与进步的民主政党团结一致，为意国“历史中有决定性的转捩点”。
    苏芬十年友好互助条约之签订，亦是本周值得注意的大事。这是苏联“争取各国和平与安全斗争中的又一伟大成就”（消息报）；国际反动派企图变芬兰为侵略工具的阴谋业已被粉碎。
    在远东，日本工人藐视麦克阿瑟的罢工禁令，罢工浪潮仍彼落此起中。印度的工人、农民、海员、大学教职员及公务员，以罢工、绝食、抗议的行动，奋起反对印度当局的反民主政策，特别是反对宣布印共为非法及大肆逮捕民主人士的反动措施。
