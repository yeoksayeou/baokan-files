Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th -- Comprehensive news from various sources: Over eight thousand students from various universities in Beiping held a large-scale anti-oppression demonstration and parade on the 9th, and surrounded Chiang bandit’s Beiping headquarters to protest the Chiang special agents' atrocities of shooting and arresting students. Since the joint strike launched by students from seven universities in Peiping and Tianjin on the 3rd of this month, demanding anti-oppression and anti-hunger, the Chiang special agents have intensified their atrocities in schools such as North China College and Peking University. On the evening of the 8th, fifty to sixty Chiang special agents broke into Beiping Normal College again, shooting and wounding students Huang Chengxian and Jing Youxin, and arresting students Yao Jiong, Zhao Xueqin and eight others, and looting several radios and phonographs, as well as 3 million Chiang currency. When committing the crimes, the Chiang bandit special agents all wore white masks or blackened their faces with ink. Students in the city were extremely indignant at this. On the morning of the 9th, hundreds of students from the Normal College defied the Chiang bandit's ban on demonstrations and parades and held an anti-oppression demonstration parade. Students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Sino-French University, Chaoyang University, Yenching University, and Beiping Railway College also rushed to participate. According to a United Press Beiping dispatch: the number of demonstrating students reached eight thousand. The students hung the bloodstained bed sheets, shirts, and pillowcases of the injured classmates high on the anti-oppression flags. The demonstrating students immediately surrounded the Chiang bandit's Beiping headquarters at Xinhua Gate, shouting anti-oppression slogans and singing on the square outside the Chiang bandit's cordon. The lyrics included "Unity is strength," and called on the people to rise up to "oppose foreign (referring to American imperialism) oppression." The Chiang bandit's headquarters was forced to send representatives to meet with the students in the afternoon. Student representatives immediately put forward serious demands, including severely punishing Chiang bandit officials who directed the Chiang special agents to commit the crimes, immediately releasing the eight students arrested on the evening of the 8th and before, and compensating for medical expenses and all losses. Under the strong pressure of the students, the Chiang bandits were forced to release the eight students arrested on the 8th at about 9 p.m., and were forced to promise to ensure that similar incidents would not happen again in the future. Late at night, the students who surrounded the Chiang bandit's headquarters in demonstration victoriously returned to school. The just anti-oppression and anti-hunger movement of students in Peiping and Tianjin has further expanded.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th -- According to foreign news agencies' reports on the 8th: The just anti-oppression and anti-hunger strike movement of students from seven universities in Peiping and Tianjin continues to expand, and has developed into a unified action of teachers and students. The Beiping Art College has joined the three-day strike to protest the occupation of one of the school's buildings by Chiang's army. Students at Beiping Normal College have extended their strike by three days to support the reasonable demands of faculty and staff at Peking University and other schools to improve their treatment. Faculty and staff at Yenching University participated in a one-day strike, and faculty and staff at Huizhong (transliteration) Girls' High School also began a three-day strike, demanding a pay raise. Note: Since the strike launched by students from seven universities in Peiping and Tianjin on the 3rd of this month, North China College and Art College have been added, and faculty and staff from five of the seven universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Nankai University, Beiyang University, and Yenching University, have acted in concert with the students to support the students' just actions and demands for improved treatment.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th -- Shanghai, 9th: Chiang bandit's Ministry of Interior has ordered the confiscation of the remaining liberal "World Knowledge," "National News," "Current Events," and "Wen San" magazines here. The Hong Kong version of "National News" has also been banned from import. Note: "World Knowledge" and "National News" both have histories of more than ten years. This wanton destruction marks the extent to which the Chiang bandits, at the end of their rope, have gone insane.

    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合各方消息：北平各大学学生八千余人于九日举行反压迫示威大游行及包围蒋匪北平行辕，抗议蒋特枪伤与抓捕学生暴行。自平、津七大学学生于本月三日起联合举行反压迫、反饥饿正义罢课后，蒋特即变本加厉的在华北学院、北大等校制造暴行，八日晚蒋特五、六十人复闯入北平师院，枪伤学生黄成先、荆又新二人，捕去学生姚炯、赵学勤等八人，抢去收音机、留声机数架及蒋币三百万元。行凶时，蒋匪特务均脸罩白色面具或以墨水将脸涂黑。平市学生对此愤慨异常。九日晨师院学生数百人蔑视蒋匪禁止示威游行禁令，举行反压迫示威大游行，北京、清华、中法、朝阳、燕京、北平铁路学院等校学生亦相继赶到参加。据合众社北平电称：示威学生共达八千人。学生们将受伤同学血迹斑斑的被单、衬衣、枕头套高悬在反压迫的旗帜上。示威学生旋即包围新华门蒋匪北平行辕，在蒋匪警戒线外广场上高呼反压迫口号及唱歌。歌词中有“团结就是力量”，并号召人民起来“反对外国（指美帝国主义）压迫”。蒋匪行辕于下午被迫派员出见，学生代表当即提出严惩指挥蒋特行凶的蒋匪官员、立即释放八号晚及以前被捕学生、赔偿医药费及一切损失等严正要求。在学生强大压力下，蒋匪被迫于晚上九时许释放八日被捕学生八名，并被迫答应保证今后不再发生类似事件，至夜深，包围蒋匪行辕示威学生始胜利返校。平、津学生反压迫反饥饿正义运动已更形扩大。
    【新华社陕北十日电】据外国通讯社八日报导：平、津七大学学生反压迫、反饥饿正义罢课运动继续扩大，并发展为师生一致行动。北平艺专已参加为期三日的罢课，抗议该校一幢校舍为蒋军盘踞。北平师院学生则延长罢课三日，支持北大等校教职员改善待遇的合理要求。燕大教职员参加罢教一日，惠中（译音）女中高中部教职员亦开始罢课三日，要求增薪。按：平、津七大学学生本月三日罢课迄今，已增加华北学院及艺专两校，而七大学中已有北京、清华、南开、北洋、燕大五校教职员为支持学生正义行动及要求改善待遇与学生一致行动。
    【新华社陕北十日电】上海九日讯：蒋匪内政部已下令查封在此间残存的自由主义的世界知识、国讯及时与文三杂志。国讯香港版亦被禁止入口。按：世界知识与国讯均有十余年历史，此次横遭摧残，标志着日暮途穷的蒋匪已疯狂到何等程度。
