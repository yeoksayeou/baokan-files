　　Shangxushe Village Cadres' Actions Are Incorrect
　　They Should Not Force Middle Peasants to Lend Grain
　　[Lingchuan News] Cadres of Shangxushe Village in Lingchuan Suburb District, attended a meeting in the district on March 28 to study spring plowing and production work. District Chief Ge instructed: Poor and hired peasants who do not have grain to eat while planting can mutually borrow and adjust with middle peasants to help each other with spring plowing and sowing (genuine voluntary mutual aid is acceptable). After the village cadres returned to the village, they immediately held a mass meeting and said: Let's discuss, which households don't have grain to eat, report yourselves. At that time, the poor peasant Wang Sanhai said: I don't have anything to eat. Then twelve households reported that they didn't have anything to eat (not all of them were poor peasants). At that time, the chairman of the farmers' association, Hou Sanyi, said: Let's discuss, which middle peasants have grain and can report to lend it to the poor peasants to eat. At this time, everyone started arguing. The middle peasant He Xiaoliu reported that he would lend four斗 of corn seed, followed by more than ten households reporting three斗 or two斗. The chairman of the farmers' association said: Why don't you report quickly? Haven't you cleared your minds yet? There are still many old middle peasants, who haven't reported, report quickly! At that time, Yang Zhaode (a young man of seventeen) reported that he would lend three斗. His father, Yang Fusheng, said: "Child! You are young and don't know the situation. What are you going to give people if you report it? Our grain is not enough to eat." Zhaode said: "We can't not report it, they will make trouble for us. Everyone says we are old middle peasants, how can we not lend it?" Fusheng said: "We don't have grain, what are you going to give people!" Zhaode said: "We will borrow three斗 from the saltpeter workshop and find a way to pay it back later." After the meeting, the old man Yang Fusheng went to the political director crying and said: You know I didn't have grain last year when I was in the first team, right? My child is young and reported three斗 at the meeting. Is it okay if I borrow one斗? The political director went to the chairman of the farmers' association to ask what was going on with borrowing grain? The chairman of the farmers' association said: The district is just asking to borrow grain from middle peasants. The political director felt something was wrong, so he went to the West River Bottom key point village to find the work team and realized that it was wrong to force middle peasants to borrow grain. The comrades in the district held a mass meeting in the village on the 7th of this month to correct this mistake, and the grain reported was not taken out. (Zhong Sheng, Man Yu, Wen Fu)

　　上徐社村干作法不对
  　不该强迫中农借粮
    【陵川消息】陵川附城区上徐社村干部，在三月廿八日到区上开会研究春耕生产工作，葛区长布置说：贫雇在种地时没有粮食吃的户，可和中农互借互剂，互相帮助春耕下种（真正自愿互剂是可以的）。村干回村即召开群众大会说：大家讨论，谁家没粮食吃自报一下。当时就有贫农王三孩说：我没有吃的啦，接着就有十二户报没吃的（不全是贫农）。当时就有农会主席侯三义说：大家讨论一下，中农谁家有粮食可自报一下，借给贫农吃。这时大家就圪吵起来，有中农贺小六自报借玉籽四斗，接着就有十多户自报三斗、二斗的，农会主席说：大家为啥不赶快报哩，还没有打通思想？老中农还多哩，谁没有报赶快报吧。当时杨照德（小青年十七岁）自报借三斗，他父亲杨福生说：“孩呀！你年青不知事，报上你要给人家啥哩？咱的粮食还不够吃。”照德说：“咱不报不行，人家要给咱找麻烦哩，人家都说咱是老中农，咱不借还行？”福生说：“咱没有粮食你要给人家啥哩！”照德说：“咱到硝坊借上三斗，以后咱设法还他。”会毕，杨福生老汉去找政治主任哭着说：咱去年在一组，你还不知道我没粮食？我孩年青在会上报了三斗，我借上一斗行不行。政治主任就去找农会主席问借粮食是怎个事情？农会主席说：区上就是叫和中农借粮食哩，这样政治主任感觉不对头，就跑到西河底基点村去找工作组，才知道这样强迫中农借粮食是不对的。区上的同志，本月七日到该村召开群众大会，纠正这种错误，自报的粮没让拿出。（忠胜、满余、文福）
