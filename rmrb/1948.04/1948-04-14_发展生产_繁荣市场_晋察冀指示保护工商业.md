Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, April 8th: The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee recently issued a directive on protecting industry and commerce during land reform, stating in brief:

(1) Factories, workshops, and stores (including state-owned, joint state-private, private, and cooperative enterprises) that comply with government laws and regulations and conduct business operations will have their property ownership, freedom of operation, and legitimate business profits protected by the government in accordance with the law. No individual or group may interfere with or infringe upon them.

(2) Landlords or old-style rich peasants who also engage in industry and commerce shall have all land and property connected to their industry and commerce protected and shall not be confiscated or distributed.

(3) If landlords or old-style rich peasants have already transferred their property into industrial and commercial operations, this property will no longer be confiscated and distributed. However, if it is to conceal wealth by posing as industry and commerce without actually operating, such property may be reported by farmers, and after investigation by the county people's court, if it is confirmed that it belongs to floating wealth that should be confiscated or requisitioned, it may be judged to be confiscated or requisitioned and handed over to the village peasant association for distribution.

(4) The industrial and commercial property of bureaucratic capitalists, war vendors, and heinous despots that has been judged by courts above the county level to be confiscated will be handled by the government and not by the peasant association. If such industry and commerce is very small in scale and operates in rural areas, it will be handled by the district government; if it is larger in scale, it will be handled separately by the county, city, administrative office, or border region government. All such industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy, whether it is decided to be taken over by the government or by the people, must be maintained in continued operation and must not be dispersed or destroyed.

(5) Hand tools in the homes of landlords and old-style rich peasants, such as spinning wheels, looms, knitting machines, sewing machines, cotton gins, and cotton batting machines, should not be confiscated or requisitioned. However, when their family labor is insufficient and they cannot hire people to operate them, and they are needed by the peasants, the surplus parts may be taken over and distributed by the village peasant association.

(6) In the past, in the review process, factories, workshops, and stores of landlords and old-style rich peasants that have already been taken over by the peasant association but have not been distributed should be persuaded to be returned to their original owners for operation. If they have already been distributed, they must be maintained in continued operation and must not be dispersed or destroyed. If the confiscated factories, workshops, and stores belong to new-style rich peasants, wealthy middle peasants, or other industrial and commercial operators, then regardless of whether they have been distributed or not, the peasants should be persuaded to return them to the original owners, or compensation should be sought as much as possible.

(7) Creditor-debtor relationships between industrial and commercial households will not be abolished. Purchasing and selling on credit between peasants and industrial and commercial households, and friendly loans between peasants, are all valid. The rights of landlords, rich peasants, and usurers in industry and commerce, which are not of a usurious nature (such as accounts receivable), should also not be abolished.

(8) Taxation of industry and commerce should be based on the principle of not hindering but protecting and developing industry and commerce.

(9) Industrial and commercial capitalists should engage in legitimate activities beneficial to the national economy under the leadership of the democratic government and the national economy, and should protect appropriate improvements in the lives of workers (improvements should be within the scope permitted by the economy). Workers should actively produce so that capitalists can obtain appropriate profits. Under the general principle of "developing production, prospering the economy, benefiting both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," workers and capitalists should unite and work together for the victory of the war and the construction of the country.

(10) Encourage factories, workshops, stores, and handicraftsmen to take on more apprentices. The living conditions of apprentices, in addition to appropriate improvements within the scope permitted by economic conditions and necessary, and the abolition of feudal or semi-feudal treatments, should generally still follow past customs.

  　晋察冀指示保护工商业
    【新华社晋察冀八日电】晋察冀边区行政委员会顷发布关于土改中保护工商业的指示，略称：（一）凡遵守政府法令，进行营业的工厂、作坊、商店（包括公营、公私合营、私营、合作经营），政府依法保护其财产所有权，经营自由权，及正当的营业利润，任何个人或团体，均不得加以干涉或侵犯。（二）地主或旧式富农兼营工商业者，其与工商业相连的一切土地财产应受保护，不得没收及分配。（三）地主旧式富农若已将其财产转移到工商业经营里面，这种财产就不再没收分配。但若是为了隐藏资财冒充工商业，实际并没有经营，这种财产可由农民告发，经县人民法庭调查，确是属于应该没收或征收的浮财，得判决予以没收或征收，交乡村农会分配。（四）官僚资本、战贩及罪大恶极的恶霸的工商业财产，经县以上法庭判决应没收的，这种财产由政府处理，不由农会处理。若这种工商业规模很小，并在乡村经营者，由区政府处理，规模较大的，分别由县、市、行署或边区政府处理。这些工商业凡属有益于国民经济者，无论是决定交政府接管或人民接管，均须保持其继续营业，不得分散或破坏。（五）地主旧式富农家中的手工工具，如纺车、织布机、织袜机、缝纫机、轧花机、弹花机等，不应该没收或征收。但当其家庭劳力不足，又不能雇人经营，并为农民所需要者，其多余部分，得由乡村农会接收分配之。（六）过去复查中，已有农会接收的地主与旧式富农的工厂、作坊、商店，其没有分配的，应说服农民交还原主经营。若已分配，均须保持其继续经营，不得分散或破坏。如所没收的工厂、作坊、商店是属于新式富农、富裕中农，或其他工商业者所有，则不论已否分配，都应说服农民归还原主，或尽可能设法补偿之。（七）工商业户之间的债权债务一概不废除。农民与工商业户之间的赊买赊卖，农民相互之间的友谊借贷均一律有效。地主、富农、高利贷者在工商业中的债权，凡不属于高利贷性质的（如货帐）也不应该废除。（八）对工商业征税，应以不妨害并保护、发展工商业为原则。（九）工商资本家应在民主政府和国家经济的领导下，从事有益于国家经济的正当活动，并应保护工人生活的适当改善（改善以不超过经济许可为范围）。工人应积极生产，使资本家获得适当的利润，在“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的总原则下，工人与资本家团结起来，共同为战争的胜利和国家的建设而奋斗。（十）鼓励工厂、作坊、商店及手工业者多带学徒。学徒生活待遇除在经济情况许可及必要的范围内作适当的改善，和废除封建或半封建性质的待遇外，一般仍应遵照过去习惯。
