　　Xu Jiahou Militia Participates in the War
  　Why Does One Work Count as Two?

To the Editor:
    When Xu Jiahou Village, Third District of Huguan, mobilized to participate in the war this Lunar January, militia members Wu Baxing and Xu Huze volunteered to join the war, and their land was farmed by the mutual aid group. Originally, the mutual aid group paid three jin of millet per work day (without meals), but because they were participating in the war, one day of war participation should count as two work days, earning six jin of millet, which was distributed among the villagers who were required to perform labor service based on their allocated quotas. Furthermore, whether it was plowing or sowing, their land would be cultivated first. Participating in the war is the duty of every citizen. One day of war participation and one day of work in the mutual aid group should be equivalent, with one work counting as one work. Special treatment, which increases the burden on the masses, is not appropriate. (Dai Yun)

　　徐家后民兵参战
  　为何一工顶两工？编辑同志：
    壶关三区徐家后村，今年旧历正月动员参战时，有民兵武八兴、徐虎则二人，自报奋勇去参战，土地由互助组代耕。原来互助组是每工小米三斤（不管饭），但他们二人在外参一天战就要顶二个工，得小米六斤，由村上应服勤务的劳力按支差分数摊派。并且不管犁地下种，都要先尽他代耕。参战是每个公民应尽的义务，参战一天和互助组做一天生活，应该是一工顶一工才合适，不应该特殊，加重群众负担。（岱云）
