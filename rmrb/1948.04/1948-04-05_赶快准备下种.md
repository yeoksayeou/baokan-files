　　Hurry and Prepare for Sowing
　　Qingming Festival is here. As the saying goes, "Plant melons and beans before Qingming," "Planting melons during Qingming requires carrying them with a pole and pulling them with a cart," "Sorghum at Qingming, flowers at Grain Rain, millet is planted at the beginning of summer." The season for sowing has arrived. Please check, is your land plowed? Has the manure been delivered to the fields? Have other miscellaneous tasks, such as preparing firewood, etc., been done? If not, it is best to hurry up, lest you delay early sowing and become anxious.
　　In previous years, we all benefited from mutual aid. This year, it is still best for us to help each other with delivering manure, plowing, and sowing. However, there were many problems with mutual aid in the past. The biggest was forced grouping, where people had to join even if they didn't want to; also, work points were not calculated, and no wages or rice were given for long hours of work. Some people suffered losses but didn't dare to speak up, which is not right. Mutual aid should be based on common interest and fairness. If you have opinions, you can formally raise them for everyone to discuss and improve. If it is unfair or unreasonable, you don't have to do it. We must work together wholeheartedly to develop production.

　　赶快准备下种
    清明节到了。俗话说：“清明前种瓜种豆”，“清明种瓜，担挑车拉”，“清明秫秫谷雨花，谷子种到初夏。”下种的节气到了。请检查一下，你的地犁好了没有？粪都送到地里没有？其他杂活，如准备烧柴等等都做好了没有？如果还没有，最好都赶紧一些，免得耽误早下种，自己干着急。
    前几年咱们都得了互助的利，今年咱们还是互助送粪、犁地、下种才好。不过，从前互助有不少毛病，最大的是强迫编组，不愿意也得入；还有不算工帐，长了工不给出工资米，有人吃了亏也不敢吭，这是不对的。互助要碰心思，要公道，自己有意见可以正式提出来，大家研究改进，不公道，不合理可以不干，要做到大伙一心发展生产才对。
