    Pingshun News: The Second District convened a meeting of county and district cadres (eleven people) leading production on April 7th. After each sub-district reported on their production situation, they conducted a strict inspection and criticism of the work during this period, distinguishing between what was right and what was wrong, so that cadres could boldly and confidently lead the masses in production. For example, regarding Comrade Zhang Pianwen's disbanding of the false peasant association in Shenjiaping, everyone believed that Comrade Pianwen first went deep among the honest poor and hired peasants, found a blacksmith worker, and inquired about the peasant who the false peasant association planned to seal their door (the false peasant association said he was a landlord). He had no debts and had not hired anyone. Although he had hired workers to herd sheep with others for a few days after the War of Resistance, he had been a long-term laborer for three years before the War of Resistance. He only became prosperous after the Communist Party came, and he was indeed a middle peasant. He also went deep into the broad masses of honest poor, hired and middle peasants in the small natural village of this village, and investigated that most of the members of the false peasant association were good people, mainly three demobilized soldiers (cadres had mobilized them to return to the army) and three degenerate cadres who were causing trouble. Before the broad masses of honest poor and hired peasants were mobilized, they did not dare to do anything to these people. This kind of in-depth work among the masses, detailed investigation, and analysis of the truth of right and wrong is very good. When inspecting Wang Keze (deputy district head) for disbanding the Han family's false peasant association, he first made a self-criticism in front of the honest poor and hired peasants. When he went to Qing Xingtou (Han Family's deputy village head) he told the eight poor and hired peasants: "I used to look down on the people of Qing Xingtou (said very sincerely), my attitude was very wrong." He inspired those eight people to say: "The Communist Party is good, going to Changzhi to study for a few days is different." It was examined that Sang Huaide in Tangli, and Ju Bao in Xiwancun, the problems of the village were all discovered. For example, Hou Fuyuan in Tangli cut down 300 trees, and the cadres in Xiwancun dared not work, and the poor peasants were unwilling to pay the money, so the cadres paid it themselves. The land left by the landlords who fled last year and the wages owed were not resolved. These district cadres knew about these problems, but they did not take the initiative to solve them. This failure to mobilize the masses, promote democracy, and boldly take the initiative to solve problems shows insufficient responsibility to the people. After such a strict inspection and criticism, the comrades were very happy and their work enthusiasm was improved. For example, Sang Huaide did not say a word before the self-criticism and criticism, feeling that he was illiterate, unable to do the work, and wanted to go home; after the criticism, he also subscribed to a diary and wanted to learn to read when he went down. Some comrades said: "It's very good to have a meeting like this, and we will have ideas when we go down!" The district military committee director said, "I feel so happy."

    平顺二区干部检查生产
    具体学习领导方法
    【平顺消息】二区四月七日召开领导生产的县区干部（十一人）会议。各小区生产情况汇报后，对这段工作作了严格的检查与批判，分清那点对那点不对，让干部放手大胆的去领导群众生产。如对张偏文同志解散申家坪假贫农团，大家认为偏文同志首先深入老实贫雇，找到一个铁匠工人，访清假贫农团计划封门的那家中农（假贫农团说是地主），没放过帐，没雇过人，虽抗战后和人伙雇过几天羊工，他在抗战前当过三年长工，共产党来了才发了家，确是个中农。又深入到本村小自然村广大老实贫雇中农中，调查清假贫农团里大部都是好的，主要是三个荣退军人（干部动员他归过队），三个蜕化干部捣乱，广大老实贫雇在未发动起来时，对这些人也不敢怎的。这种深入群众，详细调查，分析是非真相是很好的。检查到王科则（副区长）解散韩家假贫农团时，首先在老实贫雇面前检讨自己，到清行头（韩家副村）打到八个贫雇说：我过去看不起清行头人（说的很诚恳），我那种态度很不对。把那八个人启发起来了，说：共产党就是好，去长治学习几天就是不一样啦。检讨到桑怀德在棠犁，巨保在西湾，村上的问题是都发现了。如棠梨侯福元砍树三百棵，西湾村干部不敢工作，贫雇不愿出款，干部即垫了，去年逃亡地主留下的地和欠下的工资等问题未解决，这些区干部都知道，也没有作主解决，这两个村的生产始终没有起了劲。这种不去发动群众发扬民主，大胆作主解决问题，是对人民不够负责的。经过这样的严格检查批评以后，同志们非常高兴，工作情绪提高了。如桑怀德在未检讨批评前，一声不吭，觉着咱不识字，做不了工作想回家；批判后，也订下了日记本，下去要学习认字。有的同志们说：这样开会很好，下去就有了办法啦！区武委员主任说，我觉着可痛快哩。
