Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: The People's Liberation Army, advancing westward along the Xi'an-Baoji highway and the Longhai Railway, captured Fengxiang and Qishan on the 23rd and 24th respectively, wiping out units of the enemy's security forces; simultaneously, the southern route captured Caijiapo southeast of Qishan and Guozhen stations east of Baoji, annihilating part of the enemy forces. The captured materials are extremely abundant, and the results are still being tallied. The People's Liberation Army has now controlled more than 140 miles of the highway and railway lines, respectively, and the vanguard troops have approached Baoji, an important industrial city in the western end of Shaanxi controlled by the Chiang bandits.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: When the enemy's 17th Reorganized Division fled Yan'an, they were extremely panicked and frightened, abandoning a large amount of grain, materials, machinery, and ammunition. Among the ammunition, according to what has been found, there are dozens of tons of mountain artillery shells, mortar shells, 60mm mortar shells, machine gun bullets, and yellow explosives. The enemy suffered heavy losses during their retreat south, repeatedly ambushed by our local armed forces, abandoning the wounded, sick, and materials along the way. Only from the puppet Yan'an police force and the replenishment soldiers of the 123rd Brigade, more than 300 have been captured by us. Fifteen machine guns and more than 200 rifles were seized. Before the recapture of Yan'an, Jiang Jiting, battalion commander, Zhang Zhongkai, company commander, and Zhang Xinzhou, company commander of the 1st Regiment of the enemy garrison brigade, led 60 people, carrying one machine gun and 27 rifles, and gloriously revolted on the evening of the 17th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: The local armed forces of the Second Sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, advancing into southern Suiyuan, annihilated the Mongol bandit police division at Shenshan and Gaojia＠ east of Dongsheng. After two victorious battles, on the 23rd, they encircled the 256th Regiment of the enemy 86th Division from Yulin, which attempted to block our army, at Ji'er Yidu in Zhasake Banner. After several hours of fierce fighting on the 24th, they annihilated most of the regiment and captured Ji'er Yidu. According to preliminary statistics, more than 500 enemy soldiers, including the deputy regimental commander Dai Qingfang, were captured alive, more than 100 were killed or wounded, and a large amount of supplies were seized.
