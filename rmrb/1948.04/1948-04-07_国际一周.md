International Week
    March 29th to April 4th

    The democratic forces of the American people launched a powerful offensive against the American reactionaries this week. The "Wallace for President National Committee" has decided to meet in Chicago from April 10th to 11th to formulate a political platform and establish a schedule for a new party. This meeting will greatly accelerate the early establishment of the third party. The national "Peace Month" movement launched by the committee has been successfully launched in many states. "Defend Peace," "Oppose Universal Military Training and Conscription," and "Resist the Manufacture of War Mania" have become the roars of the masses at demonstrations across the country. The Democratic Far East Policy Committee also launched a "China Week" against Truman's aid to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The committee will hold national protests in various countries during the week of the 4th to the 11th, and mobilize the American people to take action (including dockworkers' strikes against military aid to Chiang Kai-shek, voters writing letters to congressmen) to stop Truman's criminal policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, the national strikes of American miners and packing workers have bravely persisted for nearly two weeks, and the strikes have seriously hit the production of basic industries such as steelmaking. Steel production has decreased by 6% this week, and some steel plants have even reduced production by 30%. These show that the American reactionary forces' policy of internal exploitation and external aggression has been and will continue to be strongly countered by the American people. This is one of the main reasons why the American reactionary policy, which appears strong but is weak, is doomed to failure.

    The Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Southeast Europe are striding towards the road of peaceful democracy and labor prosperity. The last batch of Soviet troops' demobilization has been completed as scheduled. Demobilized soldiers have all been employed or enrolled in schools, and have happily embarked on new positions. This is a most powerful satire of the warmongers' clamor. In Romania, the People's Democratic Front won an overwhelming victory in the parliamentary elections on the 28th of last month. The unprecedented enthusiasm of voters and the good order of voting have been unanimously praised by Romanian and foreign journalists. In addition, the successive passage of the Czech Land Reform Law and the Hungarian Industrial Nationalization Law will greatly promote the peaceful construction of the two countries and make people's lives more prosperous. Hungary's first elimination of deficits in financial history and the Czech Republic's increase in rations, wage increases, and tax cuts are proof of this.

    The Greek Democratic Army has won successive victories in Epirus, Thessaly, the Morea Peninsula and other places, shattering the spring offensive of the pseudo-Greek army under the direct command of U.S. imperialism. General Markos, commander-in-chief of the Democratic Army, recently predicted at a cabinet meeting that the Democratic Army will launch a more powerful offensive against the enemy and increase its firepower to strike the enemy.

    In the Far East, the dispersed national strike wave of Japanese workers is still surging. Although MacArthur's headquarters has taken the most shameless and barbaric suppression, prohibiting any kind of strike, Japanese transportation, telecommunications, coal mine workers, and government officials still continue to carry out tenacious strike struggles. In the transportation industry alone, by the end of March, 950,000 working days had been lost. As the chairman of the Transportation Workers' Strike Committee said: "Workers cannot be suppressed by force." In Burma, the workers of the whole of Burma have become more united after the Yangon Workers' Congress. The large-scale arrests launched by the reactionaries in Yangon have failed. Thakin Than Tun, one of the leaders of the Burmese Communist Party, has safely arrived in the Burmese-Chinese liberated area. The Viet Minh Republic is growing stronger and stronger in battle. The French imperialist colonial army is getting smaller and smaller as it fights, while the Viet Minh army is getting stronger and stronger, expanding twelve times in three years, and possesses modern equipment such as rocket artillery. They recently launched active attacks on the French military strongholds in the Ba Mai district of Hanoi.

　　国际一周
    三月二十九日至四月四日
    美国人民民主势力，本周向美国反动派发动了强大的进攻。“华莱士竞选总统全国委员会”已决定于四月十日至十一日在芝加哥开会，以制订政纲及建立新党日程。这一会议将大大加速第三党的早日成立。该委员会所发动的全国性“和平月”运动，已在许多州胜利展开。“保卫和平”、“反对普遍军训与强迫征兵”、“抗击制造战争狂”，变成了各地示威大会上广大群众的吼声。民主远东政策委员会亦发起反对杜鲁门援助蒋匪的“中国周”，该委员会将在四日至十一日的一周内，在各国举行全国性的抗议大会；并动员美国人民以行动（包括码头工人罢运援蒋军火、选民向议员写信）来制止杜鲁门援蒋的罪恶政策。与此同时，美矿工与包装工人的全国性大罢工，已英勇坚持将近两旬，罢工严重打击了炼钢等基本工业的生产。钢产本周已减少百分之六，若干炼钢厂甚至减产百分之三十。这些表明：美反动势力对内压榨与对外侵略的政策，已经并将继续遭受美国人民的强力反击，这正是美国外强中干的反动政策注定要失败的主要原因之一。
    苏联与东南欧新民主国家正大踏步向着和平民主与劳动繁荣的大道迈进。苏军最后一批的复员，已如期完成。复员军人已全部就业或升学，愉快地走上新的岗位。这对战争贩子的叫嚣是一最有力的讽刺。在罗马尼亚，上月二十八日的议会大选，人民民主阵线已赢得压倒胜利，选民参加之空前热烈与投票秩序之良好，获得罗国及外国记者的一致赞扬。此外，捷克土地改革法与匈牙利工业国有法之相继通过，必将大大推动两国的和平建设，使人民生活更加蒸蒸日上。匈国财政史上的第一次消灭赤字，及捷克之增加配给、增薪减税，即其佐证。
    希腊民主军近在爱匹鲁斯、色萨利、摩里亚半岛等地连战连捷，粉碎在美帝直接指挥下伪希腊军的春季攻势。民主军总司令马科斯将军近在内阁会议上预示：民主军将对敌人发动更有力的进攻，增强打击敌人的火力。
    远东方面，日本劳工分散的全国性罢工怒潮，仍波波相接。麦克阿瑟总部虽采取最无耻的野蛮镇压，禁止任何种类的罢工，但日本交通、电讯、煤矿等工人及政府机关职员等，仍继续进行顽强的罢工斗争。仅交通业至三月底止，已损失九十五万工作日。正如交通工人罢委会主席所说：“工人不是武力所能镇压得了的。”在缅甸，全缅工人在仰光职工大会之后，已更为团结。反动派在仰光发动的大逮捕，已告失败。缅共领袖之一德钦丹东已安抵缅中解放区。越盟共和国在战斗中日益成长壮大。法帝国主义殖民军愈战愈小，而越盟军则愈战愈强，三年来扩大了十二倍，并拥有火箭炮等近代装备，他们最近曾向河内巴迈区的法军据点积极出击。
