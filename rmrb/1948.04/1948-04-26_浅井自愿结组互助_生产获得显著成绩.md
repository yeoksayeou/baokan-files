    Asai Voluntarily Forms Mutual Aid Groups Achieve Significant Production Results
    [Shahe News] Last year in Asai Village, Third District, the mutual aid groups were nominally voluntarily formed, but in reality, they were forcibly organized by village cadres. At the time, the village cadres said, "Voluntary combination means everyone has to participate; no one can be left out. The widowed, orphaned, and those without labor power must participate in some group. No one can be excluded." The masses were afraid of being isolated, becoming individual households, and even if they were unwilling in their hearts, they said they were willing. Thus, although nominally a dozen groups were organized, they became mere formalities. Group leader Gao Linfu said, "Last year, Gao Linzhi, Lao Wang, and others said they were in the same group as me, but they thought my livestock was weak and didn't cooperate with me in any work." Some groups, even when working together, were not doing so voluntarily. Because if anyone wanted to leave the group, they had to openly confess their thoughts in the group, and if the original group didn't agree to let them leave, other groups wouldn't dare to take them. Therefore, even if someone had opinions within the group, they wouldn't dare to say anything. This year, when the issue of mutual aid for delivering fertilizer was raised again during the first month of the lunar calendar, the masses said, "Let's break up the old groups and reorganize!" At this time, the cadres also made self-criticisms and began to change their style. The old peasant association director, Liu Fengcai, said, "It was wrong of me to order the organization like that last year." So, in the middle of the first month of the lunar calendar, all the old groups in the village were broken up, and sixteen groups were reorganized based on the principle of voluntary participation, with people who shared common concerns combining (some original groups remained unchanged). After the voluntary combination, the masses happily said, "We are liberated!" "This year's organization is much better than last year's." Production enthusiasm has greatly increased, and the issue of equivalent labor values has also been initially resolved. Liu Fengtian's group has eleven households, fifteen laborers. As a result of democratic evaluation, eleven people were rated at ten points, one person at nine points, and three people at eight points. The group has four donkeys and four oxen, and because there is no difference, they are all valued the same for labor. Currently, the whole village is mutually helping in weeding wheat, repairing land, enclosing field edges, and planting cotton. Xing City pig bristles have fixed prices, and each group is combining agriculture with sideline occupations. Of the sixteen groups in the whole village, fourteen groups are going out to buy and sell pig bristles and pig hair. In the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, work is divided according to the principle of who can do what. Liu Fengtian's group has fifteen laborers, with four laborers specializing in buying and selling pig hair and pig bristles and combing them, and the remaining full laborers leading the semi-laborers in farming. The group also decided that no matter who does what, if they do well, in addition to profit sharing, a portion will be set aside as a bonus. This year, due to a shortage of funds, everyone decided to divide profits based on labor accounting for 70% and capital accounting for 30% (last year it was 80% and 20%). According to preliminary summaries, the village's agricultural and sideline production has made significant achievements this year. In agricultural production, the whole village has delivered all the fertilizer, and of the 1,799 mu of wheat land, 1,343 mu have been weeded. Of the 873 mu of spring land, 695 mu have been sown, including 396 mu planted with cotton, 8 mu of wasteland reclaimed, and 331 trees planted. In sideline production, the original capital of the whole village was 1.3 million yuan, and the profits earned in fifteen days totaled 2.99 million yuan. The number of laborers engaged in sideline occupations was 2,767, with each laborer earning a profit of 1,080 yuan. Now the masses are also considering buying livestock.

    浅井自愿结组互助  生产获得显著成绩
    【沙河消息】三区浅井村，去年组织的互助组，名为自愿结合，实际是村干强制组织起来的。当时村干说：“自愿结合，谁也得参加，不能漏一个人，寡孤无劳力的要参加那个组，谁也不能不叫参加。”群众谁也怕孤立，成了零户，心里不自愿也说是自愿。这样，虽名义上组织起来十几个组，实际成了形式。组长高林富说：“去年高林之、老王等三人，说的和俺到了一个组，可是人家嫌俺牲口软，没和俺互助作过活。”有的组就是在一块做活，也是不自愿的。因为谁要跳组，就得在组里坦白坦白啥思想，原组要不同意出外，别组也就不敢要，所以谁在组里就是有意见，也不敢吭。今年正月又提互助送肥时，群众说：“咱把旧组混了，再重组织组织吧！”这时干部也才作了检讨，开始改变作风，老农会主任刘风彩说：“去年我那样命令组织就是不对”。于是在旧历正月中旬，全村旧组打乱，又以自愿原则，谁与谁碰心事的结合了十六个组（有的原组没动）。自愿结合后，群众便高兴的说：“可解放了。”“今年可比去年组织的好了”。生产情绪大为提高，等价问题也得到初步的解决。刘风天组十一户，十五个劳力，民主评议的结果，顶十分的十一个人，顶九分的一个人，顶八分的三个人。该组四个驴，四个牛，因不差啥，都一样顶工。现全村正在互助锄麦，修地，圈堰边，植棉。邢市猪毛有了行价，各组又以农业结合副业，全村十六个组，便有十四个组出外买卖猪鬃、猪毛。在农、副业结合中，根据谁能干啥就干啥的原则，又分了工。刘风天组十五个劳力，四个劳力专门买卖猪毛、猪鬃和疏整，其余的整劳力带领半劳力种地。该组并决定，不管谁干啥，干好了，除分红外，抽出一部提奖。今年因资金缺，大家决定以劳七资三分红（去年是劳八资二），今年该村的农、副业生产，据初步总结，已作出显著成绩。在农业生产上，全村肥已全部送完，一七九九亩麦地，已锄了一三四三亩，春地共八七三亩，已下种六九五亩，其中种棉花三九六亩，开荒八亩，植树三三一株。副业生产，全村原资金一百三十万元，十五天赚红利，已得到手的二百九十九万元，用于搞副业的人工数为二七六七个，计每个人工赚到红利一千零八十元，现在群众又在酝酿着买牲口。
