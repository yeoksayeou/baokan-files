  　American Imperialism Shamelessly Attempts to Bribe Voters with Cigarettes
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Rome dispatch: The leading body of the Italian People's Democratic Front, in order to counter the anti-propaganda of the American and Italian reactionaries in the election campaign, which has been spreading rumors and slandering the Front, passed a resolution at the end of last month to invite representatives from newspapers and major news agencies around the world to go to Italy "in order to obtain the true news about the election campaign process and the election." The invitation has been sent out a few days ago.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Comprehensive report: The ugly drama of American imperialism undermining the Italian democratic election is becoming increasingly blatant and shameless. At the beginning of the month, Truman sent his personal representative, Deller, to the Vatican to deliver a private letter, which will be published two days before the Italian election and will be the last trump card to interfere in the Italian election. It is reported that Deller also gave Gasperi $75,000. People in Rome said that this was the money given by American imperialism to its lackey. Subsequently, according to a report from the Rome correspondent of the Telegraph News Agency, the Vatican has issued more than 3 billion lire (approximately 500,000 US dollars) to the Christian Democratic Party, the New Fascist Party, and other reactionary parties as election campaign capital. The fact that the New Fascist Party's "Italian Social Movement" newspaper "Social Voice" and other reactionary newspapers receive subsidies from the Vatican is well known in Rome. At the same time, American imperialism has used more than 20 million yuan of its relief fund in Italy to bribe voters. At the end of last month, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department stated that 360,000 packages of cigarettes had been shipped to Sardinia, and 150,000 packages were about to arrive. The Washington press sarcastically believes that the sudden "concern" of American imperialism for Italian smokers is a clumsy attempt to influence the Italian election with the "generosity" and "compassion" of American imperialism. Under the encouragement of American imperialism, Gasperi is mobilizing Italians in the American-occupied zone of Germany to return to the country to participate in the election, using free train tickets as bait; on the other hand, he is spreading rumors that the Genoa democratic municipal government is issuing double voting certificates to voters. All these unscrupulous tactics of the American and Italian reactionaries fully reflect their inner fear of the strength of the Italian People's Democratic Front.

　　民主阵线邀请各国记者
  　赴意采访大选真情
  　美帝无耻想用纸烟贿赂选民
    【新华社陕北十二日电】罗马讯：意人民民主阵线领导机关，为反击美意反动派在竞选中对该阵线造谣中伤的反宣传，已于上月底通过决议，邀请全世界报纸和重要通讯社派代表去意大利，“以便获得有关竞选运动过程和选举的真实消息”。请柬已于日前发出。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】综合报导：美帝破坏意大利民主大选的丑剧，愈演愈露骨与无耻。月初，杜鲁门派遣其私人代表戴勒赴梵蒂冈，递交私人函件一封，该函将于意大选前两日发表，将是干涉意大选的最后一张王牌。据悉，戴勒并交与加斯贝利七万五千美元，罗马人士讲称：这是美帝给其从仆之资金。接着，据电报通讯社罗马记者报导：梵蒂冈已发出三十余亿里拉（约合五十余万美元）给基督教民主党及新法西斯党等反动党派作竞选资本。新法西斯党“意大利社会运动”机关报“社会之声”等反动报纸领取梵蒂冈的津贴，在罗马已是家喻户晓。同时，美帝已将其在意国之救济基金二千余万元用于贿购选票。上月底，美帝国务院发言人声明已运三十六万包纸烟赴撒丁岛，十五万包即将运达。华盛顿报界讥刺地认为美帝突然“关心”意吸烟者，乃是想以美帝的“慷慨”和“慈悲”来影响意大选的一种拙劣企图。加斯贝利在美帝之打气下，一面动员其德境美占区的意人回国参加选举，以坐火车免票为饵；另一方面正大肆造谣说热那亚民主市政府发给选民双份投票证。美意反动派这一切无恶不作的穷相，充分反映了其对意人民民主阵线力量的内心恐惧。
