Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 26th: Rome, April 23rd: The Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, Pietro Nenni, told a United Press reporter that the Socialist Party protests the illegal means used by the Christian Democratic Party to exert pressure on voters in the election and is determined to strengthen solidarity with the Communist Party. Further, Nenni wrote in Avanti! strongly stating that the election result was influenced by foreign pressure, religious terror, and electoral fraud by the Christian Democratic Party. He angrily denounced the methods used in the election, the barbarity of which was unprecedented. These three factors make the result obtained by the De Gasperi government, from a political, moral, and legal point of view, untrustworthy. Nenni emphasized: "Continuing our struggle for the unity of all democratic forces is now more necessary than ever before. We firmly believe that future developments will prove that the political direction we have always adhered to—a broad alliance of all forces that agree with democratic rule and social progress—is correct."

    意社会党书记告记者说
    意选举不自由
    该党决与意共加强团结
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】罗马二十三日讯：意大利社会党书记巴苏顷告合众社记者说：社会党抗议基督教民主党在选举中对选民施用压力的非法手段，并决心加强与共产党的团结。又讯：巴苏在前进报上著文力称：这次选举结果是受外国压力、宗教的恐怖和基督教民主党舞弊的影响。他怒斥对选举所用的这些方法，其蛮横程度是空前未有的。这三个因素使加斯贝利政府所获结果，从政治上、道德上与法律上的观点来看是不足信的。巴苏强调说：“继续进行我们的为一切民主力量团结的斗争，今后比以往更加必要了。我们坚信：将来的发展将证明我们一向坚持的政治方向——一切赞同民主政权与社会进步的力量的广泛联盟，是正确的。”
