Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Reports from various sources: The "endless competition" (Red Star newspaper) continues between US and British monopoly capital. According to TASS on the 8th, the production and smelting of tin has been monopolized by Britain for many years, but is now facing the threat of competition from the United States. The United States has not only seized tin mines in Indonesia, but has recently invaded British Malaya, Burma, and Siam, sparking a struggle between Britain and the United States for Southeast Asian markets and raw materials. The Lebanese newspaper Al-Atiba pointed out on the 6th that the US and Britain have engaged in political attacks against each other in the struggle for Middle Eastern oil. Britain believes that the US is hindering its activities in Iraq. Therefore, the British Foreign Office has instructed British representatives in Egypt and other Arab countries to conduct anti-American propaganda in the Middle East. In early March, Clayton, the head of the British intelligence office in the Middle East, suggested to Banna, the head of the pro-fascist organization "Muslim Brotherhood," to carry out anti-American and anti-Jewish activities on oil fields belonging to various American companies. At the US-British cotton industry conference held in Manchester, England, starting on the 5th, US representatives demanded that Britain increase its consumption of American cotton. British representatives expressed deep fears about the US control of the world market and the promotion of the Japanese textile industry. Irving, chairman of the Bradford Dyers' Association, said at the meeting: "The United States is only eager to strive for its own trade freedom, but does not eliminate other countries' obstacles to imports to the United States. We oppose the United States' interference in the British preferential system and the trade relations between Britain and its autonomous territories and colonies." At present, US imperialism is using the "Foreign Aid Act" to further invade Britain. According to a report in the Chicago Sun on the 13th, the United States is demanding that Britain transfer the absolute control of dollar consumption within the sterling area to the new "Marshall Plan" executor Hoffman. Otherwise, the delivery of the first batch of "Marshall Plan" supplies to Britain will be delayed. It is reported that although the British Labor government is willing to pay a greater price due to its thirst for "US aid," it is also striving to urge the United States to reconsider this request because it is afraid of the people's opposition.

　　美英独占资本之间
  　争夺资源暗斗激烈
    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方讯：美英独占资本之间继续“无休止的竞争”（红星报）。据塔斯社八日说：关于锡的生产与熔炼，多年来都由英国一手垄断，但现在正遭受美国争夺的威胁。美国不仅攫取了印尼的锡矿，而且最近更侵入英属马来亚、缅甸、暹逻，引起了英美间争夺东南亚市场与原料的斗争。据黎巴嫩阿提巴报六日指出：美英为争夺中东石油，演成了政治上的互相攻击。英国认为美阻挠其在伊拉克的活动，因此英外交部已训令英驻埃及与其他阿拉伯国家的代表，在中东进行反美宣传。英驻中东情报处处长克莱登于三月初曾向亲法西斯组织“回教兄弟会”头子班纳建议，在各美国公司所属油田上进行反美反犹活动。五日起在英国曼彻斯特举行的美英棉业会议上，美代表要求英国增加美棉消费量，英代表对美国控制世界市场及扶植日本的纺织业深表恐惧。布拉德福德染业协会主席艾文在会上说：“美国只急于争取自己的贸易自由，却不取消他国对美输入之障碍，我们反对美国干涉英国特惠制度以及英国与其自治领、殖民地的贸易关系。”目前美帝又利用“援外法案”向英国进一步侵略。据芝加哥太阳报十三日报导，美国要求英国将英镑集团内美元消费的绝对控制权，转交给新任“马歇尔计划”执行人霍夫曼，否则将延迟运出“马歇尔计划”供给英国的第一批物资。据悉，英工党政府虽因渴求“美援”而不惜付更大代价，但又因慑于人民的反对，正竭力敦请美国重新考虑此一要求。
