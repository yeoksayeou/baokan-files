Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th: Democratic governments in Shandong's Binhai and Luzhong areas are actively seeking ways to help refugees engage in production. After the Chiang bandits implemented a "key offensive" against the Shandong area last year, they committed all kinds of atrocities, including burning, killing, and looting, forcing many people to flee. According to statistics from six counties, including Binhai, Ju County, and Donghai, there are more than 72,000 refugees. The Binhai Commissioner's Office recently issued a notice calling on people in various places to properly settle the refugees in the spirit of "all farmers under heaven are one family." The Commissioner's Office also transferred more than 20 cadres to form refugee work teams, and counties also sent personnel to specifically help refugees with production. Currently, the masses in various places have responded enthusiastically and have volunteered to help refugees settle down and start production. Donghai County has settled more than 6,000 refugees in various districts in recent days. In addition to widely mobilizing mutual assistance among the masses and helping them participate in agricultural production, the leadership has also organized refugees in each village into groups to engage in sideline production, such as lending money for oil pressing and organizing salt transportation teams. When refugees receive production materials, they are first given half of their wages to solve their food problems. Comrades working with refugees and comrades from stores in each district form groups to work together to avoid separating the work of organizing refugees from the work of supporting production. Luzhong stores organized refugees to carry out transportation production. Within nine days, they transported more than 12,000 kilograms of hemp and more than 9,700 kilograms of salt, earning more than 10.69 million yuan in total.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 18th: The Zibo Democratic Government vigorously organizes production in conjunction with relief efforts to solve the urgent food needs of the hungry masses. In Boshan urban area, in addition to leaving three cadres to handle daily affairs, the remaining 28 cadres went to various streets and villages on the 14th of last month to organize various production activities according to the characteristics of the city and the different needs of the masses. As of the 28th of last month, 11 sulfur furnaces have been organized, with 110 households participating; 134 handcarts and wheelbarrows have been mobilized to participate in work-relief programs for transporting grain and coal; 7 coal mines have been opened, providing employment for 295 people; 8 furnace workshops have been opened; 612 households have been organized to participate in small-scale production such as making tobacco pipe mouthpieces; 6 iron factories and 3 restaurants have been helped to resume business; and more than 1,600 women have been helped to obtain raw materials from the Industry and Commerce Bureau to participate in shoe making and spinning. Zichuan urban area also sent cadres to various villages to understand the situation and organize production relief. The Industry and Commerce Bureau also established a public-owned store in Zichuan city on the 22nd of last month, transferring grain, oil, and salt from various sources and selling them at 10% lower than the market price to stabilize the market. At the same time, it purchased a large number of fabrics and finished products such as shoes and socks produced by local people and transported them to other places for sale. Now the people of Zibo are at ease and the order is well maintained. In addition: The Industry and Commerce Bureau has issued more than 4 million yuan in agricultural and other in-kind loans, half in Zibo and half in Boshan. Another 3.3 million yuan in loans has been allocated to help small vendors in Zichuan as production funds, and 50,000 kilograms of grain have been used to relieve poor citizens.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: Yishui Democratic Government in Luzhong provides disaster relief to the victims. During the Chiang bandit occupation, the masses suffered all kinds of devastation. Up to 200 civilian houses in Dongguan were demolished. When the bandits fled this time, they even shot 36 innocent people in Nanguan, and more than 5,000 young adults from 21 villages in the suburbs were taken away, along with 139 cattle and donkeys. In Nanzhuang, with 104 households, only five young adults and 30 elderly and weak people remained. According to those who escaped home, most of the young adults who were taken away were forced to join the ranks. After the democratic government entered the city, the county Industry and Commerce Bureau immediately sold sweet potato flour at half the market price, selling more than 1,000 kilograms on the first day, and also sold raw materials for making shoes and cotton at low prices. A factory has already issued 500 pairs of shoe soles, with a wage of 8 kilograms of grain per pair. The Luzhong Production Relief Committee and the county government have also allocated 700 hoes and shovels, 700 kilograms of vegetable seeds, and 10,000 kilograms of grain seeds to help farmers with production in the district.
