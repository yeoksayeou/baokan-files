Correcting the Error of Randomly Struggling Against Middle Peasants: Everyone in Dongdacun Village is Satisfied
Restore to Original Land as Much as Possible
Spreading Good News Everywhere After Receiving Compensation

[Yongnian News] The work team in Dongdacun Village, Second District of this county, led the masses in correcting the error of randomly struggling against middle peasants, which won warm support from the masses and stabilized and improved the production enthusiasm of the whole village. In the past, the village had no standard for classifying class status; whoever was rich was struggled against, and even small mistakes led to struggle. In addition, the village cadres and activists had an undemocratic work style, or engaged in personal revenge, resulting in many middle peasants being wrongly struggled against.

Some cases involved implicating others, such as struggling against Zhang San and dragging in Li Si because of kinship or family ties. For example, Du Guorui was originally a very good hard-working person. Before the struggle, his family of seven had thirty mu of land, of which ten mu were bought through his own hard work after the family division (before the division, there were only twenty mu, including ten mu that were mortgaged). He never used hired labor or engaged in other forms of exploitation. However, because his daughter-in-law's uncle later served as a puppet soldier for four months, he was driven out of his home and all his property was confiscated. His younger brother, Du Guodong, was in a similar situation. He was a well-known hard worker who didn't even take a nap during work. Just because he was Guorui's brother, he was also driven out of his home.

Some cases were due to discord with the cadres, turning minor issues into major problems. Zhang Wenrong's family of four had only four mu of inherited land. His grandfather had been a long-term hired laborer, his father was a tenant farmer, and he himself had worked as a short-term laborer and plowed land for others since childhood, saving money to mortgage twelve mu of land. During the enemy and puppet regime, because the land was poor and couldn't produce enough grain to pay taxes, he served as a village informant for four months. He was a well-known "half-ox" (meaning someone who could do the work of half an ox), a hard worker in the village. Because of his constant discord with village chief Fang Zhijiang, and the fact that his son had a relationship with Fang Zhijiang's daughter, Fang seized upon his mistake of being an informant, stirred things up, and had him struggled against, fined 300,000 yuan. He paid 220,000 yuan, plus seven dou of sorghum, 600 jin of garlic, five small trees, and still had a remaining debt. After the struggle, he couldn't make a living. He wanted to send his children to push salt and go begging himself, but the village cadres wouldn't allow it. His wife was so frightened that she fell ill and never recovered.

Some cases were because of poor character. For example, when Du Jingyi's family divided, his three-person family only received seven or eight mu of land. His wife earned some money by weaving and bought another seven or eight mu. Because he was stingy, wouldn't let others use his ox when it was idle, and was good at搶水 (qiangshui, a practice of unfairly diverting water for irrigation), and his wife liked to laugh at people, he was struggled against, and six mu of land, one ox, ten trees, 600 jin of grain, and 400 jin of garlic were confiscated. Bao Guangwen was struggled against and had a donkey confiscated because he had once sold noodles to village chief Song Yucheng and pressed him hard for payment. Once, militiamen bought noodles from him and asked him to roll them out, but he refused. Once, the noodles he sold to the village public office were underweight (opinions raised at the struggle meeting). The main excuse was that he had stored six bags of grain for the landlord Zhao Hongxiu.

The masses completely disapproved of these random struggle phenomena. In the past, the masses didn't know what was going on and didn't speak out. Some were forced by cadres to give opinions against those being struggled against, and after the meeting, they would say to the victims, "If I didn't speak, it wouldn't have been okay with them."

Correcting the error of wrongly struggling against middle peasants was carried out simultaneously with land redistribution. Beforehand, the work team educated the members of the poor peasant groups, making them understand what a middle peasant was and that middle and poor peasants were one family. Then, they guided everyone to check which of the households being struggled against were their own family members (middle peasants). The groups conducted the first round of research. Based on the criteria for classifying class status, they determined that five households (mentioned above) were definitely middle peasants and decided to immediately return the land to them so they could plant crops (the peasant association still had over one qing of land in storage). Other properties would be discussed after the establishment of the poor peasant league and peasant representative conference. When returning the land, they tried to return the original land to the owners. The land that had already been distributed to poor peasants was temporarily compensated with other land, to be returned after the harvest. If land had been plowed but not sown, it was returned to the original owner, and the plowing labor was compensated. Only Tang Furong, Du Qinglong, and Zhao Chunyin disagreed with this. The reason was that they were farming other people's land and living in other people's houses. Returning the land made them feel ashamed, so they insisted that the poor peasants should be taken care of first. Some had mortgaged their land to these households during years of famine, and redeemed it during the struggle, and they were afraid of having to return it. The excuse was that those who had been struggled against had served as neighborhood chiefs (閭長, lǘzhǎng) etc. (actually they were forced). The masses persuaded these three dissenting individuals, saying, "Today we are all one family. Don't let a little bit of our personal interests cause discord." So, everyone decided that the poor peasants who returned the land would immediately be given other good land. It was also decided that if the amount of land a wrongly struggled-against household possessed, even after some land had been taken away, still exceeded that of a general poor peasant, no more land would be returned. The amount of land returned would be limited to the amount that made them equal to a general middle peasant. (This should be agreed upon by the wrongly struggled-against middle peasant themselves. If they do not agree, it should be returned in full. – Editor)

Formally Acknowledging Mistakes

After the discussion, the five wrongly struggled-against households were brought in, and land was distributed to them. The past mistakes were formally reviewed, saying, "In the past, it was like the flood washing away the Dragon King Temple, not recognizing our own family members. Now we recognize it. In the future, you can participate in the peasant association." Finally, a mass meeting of middle and poor peasants was held, where the poor peasants formally announced the cancellation of the "struggled-against household" label, and each wrongly struggled-against household was invited to speak. The work team took the opportunity to educate everyone on the idea of middle and poor peasants as one family, calling on everyone to work hard in production and explaining that there would be no more random struggles in the future. Mistakes in struggles will continue to be corrected. (Editor's note: The proper procedure for completing the correction of errors should be to have the middle and poor peasants discuss the composition of each household together in the peasant association before proceeding. The poor peasants taking over this matter is inappropriate.)

Special Consideration for Loans

Regarding loans, the unanimous opinion of the masses was to give special consideration to the wrongly struggled-against middle peasants. Some were given loans of 30,000 yuan, others 40,000 yuan, to help them buy farm tools, etc.

The day after the mass meeting, Du Guorui happily ran to his father-in-law's house in Gongzhuang to report the news, saying that he was no longer a struggled-against household. His wife, who had only washed her face twice since the struggle, immediately washed up and dressed up, saying, "A weight has been lifted from my heart." His child said, "It's like we've had a wedding." His mother came out on crutches and said to everyone, "We are one family again. Last year when there was a play in the street, other people's in-laws came to watch, but my in-laws didn't dare to come." Du Guodong also went to his father-in-law's house to report the news. His father-in-law was a middle peasant, and many of his neighbors were also middle peasants. Hearing that the struggle had been wrong and the land had been returned, the news spread quickly from in-law to in-law and soon reached Shangbei Village in Handan. When he returned home, he went to his aunt's house in Qigu and his sister's house in Heying to report the news. He went to his neighbor to borrow a shovel, preparing to dig the land. Bao Guangwen said, "In the past, I always thought that Chairman Mao's leadership wasn't good! How could we, the suffering people, also be struggled against? Now I understand, Chairman Mao truly cares for the suffering people, Chairman Mao is still good."

The masses were very satisfied with this correction of errors, saying: This is truly seeing the light of day, truly fair. When the meeting ended, the masses did not disperse. Many people sat in the field chatting. Some said, "I thought that people shouldn't be struggled against!" Some said, "Before, we didn't believe that middle peasants wouldn't be struggled against. Do you believe it now?" Some complained about the past, saying, "Wouldn't our village have wasted more than one qing of land if it hadn't been for this? Before, regardless of whether people were exploiting or not, who would have the heart to work if they were struggling like that?" "If those households were all struggled against, who knows when it would be our turn!" Old Haizi, who was over fifty years old and had been a hired laborer for twenty years, had acquired twenty mu of land for his five-person family, and was always afraid. When the work team first came to the village, he was so scared that he couldn't even eat. Now he also said, "Our Dongdacun street will be peaceful from now on!" Some people said with emotion, "It is still the suffering people who are thriving, let's all try our best." (Yin Zhixi)

    纠正乱斗中农错误  东大慈村人人满意
    尽量退还原地
    得到补偿后到处报喜讯
    【永年消息】本县二区东大慈村工作组领导群众纠正乱斗中农的错误，获得群众热烈拥护，稳定与提高了全村生产情绪。该村过去因为划阶级无标准，谁富斗谁，有一点小错也斗，再加上村干部积极分子作风不民主，或私人报复，错斗了不少中农。其中有的是打张三带李四，因亲戚或本家关系被斗的：比如杜国瑞，本来是一个很好的受家。未斗前家里七口人，三十亩地，其中有十亩是分家后自己努力劳动买下的（未分家时只二十亩地，内有十亩是典的活地），从来没用过雇工，也没有其他剥削。只因儿媳的舅父后来当了四个月伪军，自己就被扫地出门，完全没收了。他的弟弟杜国栋，情形与他相同，是著名的好受家，干活连午觉都不睡，就因为是国瑞弟弟，也扫地出门了。有的是因与干部不睦，小事变成大事。张文荣四口人，老根地只四亩，祖父当了一辈子长工，父亲是佃户，他本人从小就给人家打短工、犁地，积钱典了十二亩活地。敌伪时期因为地坏打不下粮，上不起款，当了四个月村的情报员，在村是有名的“半只牛”，好受家。因与村长芳至江一贯不睦，他儿与芳至江女人有关系，芳便抓住他当情报员这个错误鼓动一下，把他斗了，罚款三十万元。出了廿二万，又出七斗高粱，六百斤蒜，五棵小树，还有尾欠。斗争后无法渡日，想叫孩子去推盐，自己去卖唱要饭，村干部也不让；老婆吓得病了，一直不好。也有的是因为为人不好被斗。比如，杜经义分家时三口人，只分得七、八亩地，老婆纺织赚了些钱，又买七、八亩，因为他看东西真（吝啬），牛闲着不叫人使，浇地好抢水，老婆好笑话人，就被斗争了，没收去六亩地，一头牛，十棵树，六百斤粮，四百斤蒜。鲍光文被斗，没收了一头驴，原因是他有一次卖面给村长宋玉成，要帐要的紧了；有一次民兵买他面叫他杆一下，他不杆，有一次卖给村公所面不够秤（斗争大会上提的意见）。主要借口是他保存过地主赵洪秀家六布袋粮食。群众对以上这些乱斗现象是完全不同情的。过去斗争时，群众不知道，也不发言。有的被干部强迫着给被斗者提了意见，会后见了被斗者说：“俺不提，人家不行。”
    纠正错斗中农是与填补工作同时进行的。事前工作组在贫农小组中做了教育，使大家了解什么是中农，中、贫农是一家人以后，即引导大家检查被斗户中那些是自家人（中农），分组进行第一次研究，大家根据划阶级标准认为肯定是中农的有五户（即上面提到的），确定马上补给土地让他们下种（农会还存着一顷来地），其他财产待贫农团、农代会成立后再说。补地时，尽量退给了人家的原地，已分给贫农的暂时补给别的地，等收了庄稼后再归还。犁了未种的，退还原主，给犁地工钱。对于这个意见，只有唐福荣、杜庆龙、赵春寅三人不同意。原因是他们种着人家的地，住着人家的房子，退了觉得丢脸，所以坚持应先照顾贫农。有的过去灾荒年当给这几户土地，斗争时赎了，怕要退。借口则是说被斗者以前当过闾长等（其实是被迫的）。群众解劝这三个有意见的人说：“今天咱们都成了一家人啦，不要因为咱个人一点利益闹得不和气了。”所以大家决定，退了地的贫农，马上分给别的好地。又决定：如果被斗者虽然动了地，但现有地仍超过一般贫农的，不再退。退地以与一般中农一样多为限。（这应征得错斗中农本人同意，如本人不同意应如数退还。——编者）
    正式承认错误
    讨论好以后，即将五个错斗户找来，给他们分地；并正式检讨过去错误说：“过去是大水冲了龙王庙，一家人不认一家人，现在认识了。以后可以参加农会。”最后召开中贫农群众大会，由贫农正式宣布：取消“被斗户”名称，又请各个被错斗户讲话；工作组趁机进行了中贫农一家人的教育，号召大家努力生产，说明以后再不乱斗。斗错的，继续纠正。（编者按：纠正错误工作的完善手续，应该是在农会里中贫农一起讨论好各户成份后进行，这里贫农包办是不妥当的）。
    贷款特别照顾
    贷款中，群众的一致意见是特别多照顾一下错斗中农。给他们有的贷了三万，有的贷了四万，帮助他们买农具等。
    开过群众大会的第二天，杜国瑞就高高兴兴跑到弓庄他丈人家报讯，说不是被斗户了，他老婆被斗后只洗过两次脸，这天马上梳洗了一番，说：“心上去了一块坯”。他孩子说：“好象过了场喜事了。”他母亲拄着拐杖出来，见了人说：“咱可又是一家人了。去年街上唱戏，人家亲家都来看，俺的亲家不敢来。”杜国栋也到丈人家报讯，他丈人是中农，邻家也有许多是中农，听到斗错真退地，亲家传亲家，很快就传得邯郸尚北村都知道了。他回来时，又到齐固他姨家，何营他妹妹家都报了讯。回家就到邻家借锹，准备掘地。鲍光文说：“我过去老是想毛主席领导的可不好啊！怎么咱这受苦的人也斗了呢？现在我明白了，毛主席真正是待见（爱）受苦人，还是毛主席好。”
    群众对这次纠正错误，非常满意说：这是真正见青天，真公道。大会结束时群众都不散，许多人坐在场上闲谈。有的说：“我合摸（心想）就不该斗人家！”有的说：“以前说不斗中农咱不信，这看信不信？”有的埋怨过去说：“咱村要不就能荒了这一顷多地？以前不管剥削不剥削那个斗法，谁还有心干活呢？”“象人家那些户都斗了，不知多会轮到咱头上！”五十多岁的老海子，以前当过二十年雇工，置了二十亩地，五口人，心里还老是害怕，这次工作组初到村时，连饭都吓的吃不下；现在也说：“以后咱东大慈街可和平了！”也有的人感慨的说：“还是受苦人吃得开，好好受吧。”（尹之席）
