Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 4th. The directly subordinate organs and financial and economic systems of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Joint Defense Military Region held a mobilization meeting for organ production on March 22nd. Bai Rubing, Minister of Logistics of the Joint Defense Military Region, called for the development of organ production, pointing out that only by developing production and reducing public expenditures can the burden on the people be reduced and the war be won. Minister Bai criticized several prevalent biases in the current understanding of production: (1) Some believe that since the public already has unified planning and expenditure, there is no need for further production. They do not understand that unified planning and expenditure only unifies leadership policies, guidelines, systems, and standards; vigorous development of public and private production is still necessary to ensure supply, and one cannot have a mentality of dependence. (2) Some believe that without commercial transactions, production is difficult, and that small-scale handicraft workshops and small businesses are meaningless; this is a purely merchant's viewpoint. (3) Some believe that in a war environment with no fixed base, it is difficult to engage in production. In fact, we can now send people to stable areas to organize farms. (4) Some believe that the establishment is too strict, and that after streamlining administration and reducing personnel, there are too few people to produce. In reality, we have not seriously organized all production forces. (5) Individual units demand that their production income should be used at their discretion, and if they still have to spend according to standards, they would rather not produce. This is a typical manifestation of individualism and departmentalism. Minister Bai also put forward specific suggestions for this year's production: (1) Do not rely solely on a few production personnel fighting alone; rely on everyone to participate. (2) Combine the needs of the people with the supply of the organs, produce necessities for the masses, which can both exchange local products, stabilize finance, and stabilize prices, and ensure the supply of the public and obtain reasonable profits. Each unit can sign production contracts (individual or collective) with the supply department, trade company, health department, transportation brigade, and other organs according to its own capabilities, deliver goods on time, ensure mutual benefit, and resolutely prohibit illegal transactions. (3) Promote mutual assistance and mutual exchange of labor. (4) Grasp the time, seasons, and priorities, carry out production in a planned manner, and overcome blindness. (5) Take into account both public and private interests, both military and civilian interests, establish reward and punishment systems, and cultivate labor heroes and model workers. (6) Combine production with conservation. (7) Leaders are responsible; this is the key issue. The head of each department must personally participate in this year's production movement and regularly check and urge, and summarize experiences.

After the meeting, the organs responded to the call for production one after another. Organs at the border region level planned to complete the three supply tasks of vegetables, oil, and meat. The Northwest Bureau prepared to grow vegetables on the old farm in Ansai and raise more than 200 sheep in Yanchang. The Border Government withdrew livestock within the establishment to organize transportation. The Security Office, the Post Office, and other departments are preparing to set up small-scale soap weaving and dyeing workshops and mule and horse shops, etc. The Northwest Transportation Brigade opened leather workshops, hemp rope shops, and other stores to supply organs and the masses with livestock equipment at low prices.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 4th. Lan County, Yangqu and other places implement public-private cooperative management of iron factories and coal mines. The Lan County Democratic Government subsidized the mass-rehabilitated casting plow iron factory. The government advanced horses, coal, and food, and the factory only contributed labor. A large number of plows have now been produced and sold to the masses at low prices, with considerable profits. The public and private sectors share the profits at a ratio of 2:8, and the factory and workers are stepping up mass production. In order to help the masses open iron factories, the Yangqu Trade Bureau first advanced more than 300 feet of native cloth, so that the masses could exchange the cloth for raw iron. After the iron factory started operation, the Trade Bureau first ordered 3,000 plows, which greatly stimulated the workers' production enthusiasm and they worked day and night to rush production. The products of the factory have been selling well in Yangqu, Jingle, Jiaocheng, Fenyang and other places. An organ in Suiyuan-Mongolia jointly opened two coal mines with the masses. All production reserves were the responsibility of the organ, and the profits were shared equally between the public and private sectors, which solved the problem of spring plowing rations for many people in nearby villages.

　　陕甘宁晋绥各机关
  　澄清思想组织生产
　  岚县等地公私合作经营铁厂煤窑
    【新华社西北四日电】陕甘宁晋绥联防军区直属机关及财经系统各单位，于三月二十二日召开机关生产动员大会，联防军区后勤部长白如冰号召开展机关生产。指出只有发展生产，减少大公家开支，才能减轻人民的负担，支持战争取得胜利。白部长批判了目前对生产认识的几种偏向：（一）认为已有大公家统筹统支，不必再搞什么生产。不知统筹统支，只是领导政策方针制度标准的统一，仍须大力发展公私生产，供给才有保障，不能存依赖心理。（二）认为不做商业买卖，生产便难进行，手工业作坊和小本生意没意思，这是单纯商人观点。（三）认为战争环境，驻地不固定，不好搞生产。其实目前我们已可以派人到稳定的地区组织农场。（四）认为编制很严，经过精兵简政，人员太少，无法生产。实际上，我们还没有认真的组织所有生产力量。（五）个别单位要求生产所得，应由他任意开支，若仍要按标准开支，他宁愿不生产。这是典型的个人主义与本位主义。白部长并对今年生产提出具体意见：（一）不是只依靠少数生产人员孤军奋斗，要依靠大家动手。（二）将人民需要和机关供给结合，生产群众必需品，既可交流土产，稳定金融，平抑物价，又可保证大公家的供给及能获合理的利润。各单位可根据本单位的能力与供给部、贸易公司、卫生部、运输大队等机关订立生产合同（个人的或集体的），按期交货，保证互有利得，坚决禁止做违法买卖。（三）发扬互助，互相变工。（四）掌握时间季节及重点，有计划的进行生产，克服盲目性。（五）公私兼顾，军民兼顾，订立奖惩制度，培养劳动英雄和模范工作者。（六）生产与节约结合。（七）首长负责，这是关键问题。每个部门的首长在今年生产运动中必须亲自参加，并经常检查督促，总结经验。
    会议后，各机关即纷纷响应生产号召，边区一级各机关计划完成菜、油、肉三项供给任务。西北局准备在安塞旧农场种蔬菜，并在延长牧羊二百余只。边府抽用编制内的牲口组织运输。保安处、邮局等分别筹组小型肥皂纺织染坊和骡马店等。西北运输大队开皮坊麻绳掌铺等商店，低价供给机关群众牲畜用具。
    【新华社晋绥四日电】岚县、阳曲等地公私合作经营铁厂煤窑。岚县民主政府资助群体恢复之铸铧铁厂，由政府垫出马匹、煤炭和粮食，厂方仅出人工；现已出产大批铧子，廉价售与群众，获利甚丰，由公私二八分红，厂方及工人均加紧大量生产。阳曲贸易局为帮助群众开办铁厂，先垫出土布三百余丈，使群众以布换回生铁，铁厂开工后，贸易局又首先订铧子三千张，大大刺激了工人生产情绪，日夜赶制。该厂出品已畅销阳曲、静乐、交城、汾阳等地。绥蒙某机关与群众合开煤窑两座，一切生产底垫，均由机关负责，赢利公私对半分红，解决了附近村庄许多群众春耕口粮的困难。
