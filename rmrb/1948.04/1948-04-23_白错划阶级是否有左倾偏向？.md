　　Is the Incorrect Class Designation in Bai Cuo Village a Leftist Deviation?
　　Regarding the article on democratic class designation in Bai Cuo Village, Shahe County, published on April 1st, in addition to the editor's timely identification of its strengths and weaknesses, I have the following supplementary opinions:
　　Bai Cuo Village has conducted class designation three times, and I heard the third list will be announced soon; but in my personal view, many abnormal phenomena have occurred in the class designation process. For example: in class disputes, Hao Yonglin and Lü Chuncai were dissatisfied with being classified as middle peasants, Hao Cunjian disagreed with being classified as old middle peasants, Hu Hutang insisted on being an old middle peasant, Han Jisuo agreed to be classified as upper-middle peasant only after explanation, and Hu Xiaolai was afraid of being classified as upper-upper-middle peasant; in class differentiation, Hu Maotang and Hu Chenghu were designated as upper-middle peasants, and Hao Shude, Hao Yonglin, and Hu Qingxiu were designated as rich peasants; in terms of mass attitudes, there were dishonest self-reports, with new middle peasant Hao Dasuo reporting as a poor peasant and being designated as an upper-middle peasant awaiting land redistribution, and poor peasant Hu Jiuzhu reporting as a new middle peasant (see the first page of Xin Dazhong on April 11th), etc. Besides the three points that the article mentioned the leadership should pay attention to, it lacks sufficient and profound criticism to remind them to further understand, and at the same time weakens the guiding role of the article in spreading and promoting experience. Were these phenomena noticed, corrected, and overcome? What is the current situation? Because there are no follow-up reports, it is impossible to know.
　　It is good that the masses insist on their own opinions and have disputes in class designation, and it is also the result of promoting democracy. We must never think that there is something wrong with the work just because there are disputes. But at the same time, we cannot deny that it provides everyone with another aspect to further understand the real thoughts of the masses, that is to say: in the promotion of democracy, the muddled thinking of the masses and the shortcomings and biases of the work team are clearly exposed. The emergence of these problems stems from the following three points:
　　(1) The propaganda and explanation of Chairman Mao's two basic principles of land reform and the five policies of consolidating and uniting all middle peasants are not clear and in-depth enough, and the party's correct policies have not been fully grasped by the masses. Precisely because of this, the masses have a mechanical understanding of "the poor peasants get things, the middle peasants get nothing, and the rich middle peasants will have to give up some land" (see Xin Dazhong on the same day), and doubts and dishonest self-reporting will follow. Therefore, in the work process, we must also faithfully, correctly, and concretely publicize and explain the two reports of Chairman Mao and Comrade Ren Bishi, strengthen policy education, and dispel the doubts of the masses.
　　(2) The explanation of the criteria for composition is not specific and clear enough, and the appropriate and flexible application of the criteria according to different objects is lacking. There is a tendency to be left-leaning in the division. It is worth considering that Hu Maotang was classified as an upper-middle peasant. Based on the materials, it is questionable whether Hu Qingxiu should be classified as a rich peasant (although he was designated as an upper-middle peasant because he worked hard and was frugal). It should be what it should be, and there must be no ambiguity. Judging from the whole material, the tendency to squeeze upward is strong, otherwise the report is inaccurate. Therefore, in terms of composition criteria, we must continue to repeatedly explain and apply them in practice in order to achieve true fairness and rationality, and everyone's satisfaction.
　　(3) There is a lack of timely discovery and support for the correct opinions of the masses, and necessary education and explanation for some backward understandings. Several people were put aside because of disputes, especially Hao Shude, who was not corrected for turning good land into bad land and being classified as a rich peasant, and was left to be determined later. This will cause unease among some who have not been determined, affecting production. Of course, some cannot be decided because of insufficient information and need to be studied again. However, if there are deviations in the understanding of the masses, they should be promptly reminded and corrected, and should not be left alone or postponed. The awakening of the masses should be waited for, but leadership must never be abandoned.
　　The key to overcoming and correcting the above phenomena today does not lie in the cognitive ability and extent of the masses, but in the guidance and role that the work team should play. Therefore, it is hoped that the comrades of the work team should conduct a comprehensive and profound self-examination from the ideological aspect in connection with their work; whether there is dogmatism in the propaganda and explanation of policies; whether the leadership is weak and committed tailism and left-leaning sentiments; whether there are crude, unserious, and impatient problems in the work style. Do not be satisfied with the study of the land conference, but should repeatedly and continuously check yourselves and verify the policies in actual work, carry forward criticism and self-criticism, so as to promptly correct shortcomings and deviations, so that "the correct ones can be promoted, and the wrong ones will not be repeated," so that the party's policies are truly combined with the interests and demands of the masses, and both improve the masses and improve yourselves.
　　My opinion must have subjective or incorrect aspects due to limited materials, but in order to improve the work and arouse research, I offer the above for reference. (Gao Xin)
　　Editor's note: Comrade Gao Xin's opinions on the class designation in Bai Cuo Village are worth studying and discussing. It is hoped that the comrades of the Bai Cuo work team will make an inspection.
　　In addition, there is another issue that deserves attention. In the class designation in Bai Cuo, there are words such as "upper-middle peasant" and "lower-middle peasant," which are wrong. In the central government's class designation documents, there is no such classification. In the middle peasant composition, there are only well-to-do middle peasants and middle peasants, and the reason why some well-to-do middle peasants are included in the middle peasants is also to protect them. The meaning is that although they are richer than ordinary middle peasants, they are still middle peasants, and they are the laboring class, who should be resolutely protected and should not be infringed upon. However, many of our comrades deliberately raise the composition, classifying many as upper-middle peasants, with the intention of infringing on their interests, which is wrong. In the future, working comrades in various places should carefully study the documents and act in accordance with the policies.

### 白错划阶级是否有左倾偏向？

　　白错划阶级是否有左倾偏向？
    四月一日，报载沙河县白错村民主划阶级一文，除了编者同志及时指出其中优缺点外，我还有如下意见补充：
    白错村划阶级已经进行了三次，闻不久将公布第三榜；但依我个人看，在划阶级中曾发生了不少不正常现象，例如：阶层争议上有郝永林、吕春才不满意划上中农，郝存见不同意划老中农，胡虎堂坚持老中农，韩记锁经过解释后才同意划上中农，胡小来怕划上上中农；区别阶级上有胡茂堂、胡成虎定为上中农，郝树德、郝用林、胡清秀定为富农；群众态度上发生自报不老实，新中农郝大锁报贫农，被定成上中农后等待抽地，贫农胡九柱报新中农（见四月十一日新大众第一版）等等。这些现象，除了该文曾指出领导上应注意三点外，还缺乏充分与深刻的批判，以提醒其进一步的认识，同时减弱了该文传播与推广经验的指导作用。这些现象是否被觉察、纠正、克服？现状如何？因没有继续报导，无从了解。
    划阶级中群众坚持本人意见和有争议是好的现象，也是发扬民主的结果，绝不能因为有争议，即认为工作有毛病，但同时不能否认，它又向大家提供了进一步了解群众真实思想的另一方面，就是说：在发扬民主中明显暴露了群众的糊涂思想和工作组的缺点和偏向。这些问题的产生，是从下面三点而来的：
    （一）宣传解释毛主席两条土改的基本原则和巩固的团结全体中农的五项政策，不够明确与深入，党的正确政策还没有被群众完全掌握。正由于此，群众中发生了“贫农分东西，中农不能分，富裕中农便得抽”的机械认识（见同上新大众），疑虑与自报不实就会随之而来。因此，在工作过程中，还必须忠实的正确的具体的宣传解释毛主席和任弼时同志两个报告，加强政策教育，解除群众中的疑虑。
    （二）讲解成份标准不够具体明确，以及根据各个不同对象按标准恰当的灵活运用。划分上表现有偏左倾向，胡茂堂划到上中农很值得考虑，胡清秀依材料看是否会列入富农有疑问（虽然因他劳动好，省吃俭用被定为上中农），是啥应是啥，绝不能含糊一点。从统篇材料看，挤上倾向是浓厚的，否则报导有失实的地方。因此在成份标准上，还须要在实际中继续反复讲解与运用，以求得真正公平合理，大家称心满意为止。
    （三）缺乏及时发现与支持群众的正确意见，与对某些落后认识作必要的教育与解释。有好几人因有争议而搁起，尤其对郝树德因把好地弄成坏地，评成富农不加纠正，放下随后再定。这样就会引起一部未被确定成份的不安，影响生产。固然，有的因情况不足不能下决定，须要再次研究。但群众认识上如有偏差，应及时从旁提醒纠正，不能听之任之，或者放下拖后，群众觉悟应该等待，却万不能放弃领导。
    上面种种现象的克服与纠正之关键，今天不在群众认识能力与程度如何，而在于工作组的引导与应起的作用。因此希望工作组同志对此应结合工作从思想上作一番全面的深刻检查；宣传解释政策上是否存在教条？领导上是否表现软弱、犯了尾巴和左的情绪？作风上是否存在粗糙、不严肃、不耐烦的毛病？切不要满足于土地会议的学习，应该在实际工作中反复不断地检查自己与证验政策，发扬批评与自我批评，以便及时纠正缺点和偏向，做到“正确的获得推广，错误的不致重犯”，使党的政策真正同群众利益与要求结合起来，提高群众又提高自己。
    我的意见因为材料有限，一定有主观或不正确的地方，但为了改进工作与引起研究起见，特提供如上，并作参考。（高辛）
    编者按：高辛同志对白错村划阶级所提意见，值得研究讨论。希望白错工作组同志作一检查。
    此外，还有一个问题值得注意，白错划成份当中，有“上中农”“下中农”等字样，这是错误的。中央划阶级文件中，并没有这种划法，在中农成份中，只有富裕中农和中农，而且所以把中农当中划有一些富裕中农，也是为了保护他们。意思就是说，他虽然比一般中农富裕一些，也还是中农，是劳动阶级，应该坚决保护，不得侵犯。但我们有很多同志，故意提高成份，划有许多上中农，其用意是侵犯他们的利益，这都是错误的。今后各地工作同志，应该好好研究文件，按照政策办事。
