Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: The Boshan City Democratic Government is supporting private industrial and mining enterprises to resume production. Eleven private factories and coal mines, including Xihe, Boshan, and Jingming, producing electric grinding mills, calcium carbide, and glass, have commenced production after receiving loans of 200 million in local currency (each yuan equivalent to 50 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek's legal tender) and 50,000 jin of grain. Boda Mine produces 100 tons of coal daily, while Xihe Mine has fully restored the Liziyuan and Da Kuishan coal mining sites. Da Kuishan alone produces over 80 tons daily. The electric grinding mill produces 800 jin of flour daily, the calcium carbide factory produces 400 jin of products daily, and the glass company produces one case of finished products daily. The iron factory is rushing to produce a large number of agricultural tools. In addition, the four coal mines of Huadong, Dongfang, Dacheng, and Ruicheng have also begun draining water and preparing to resume work. In order to help various mines and factories circulate funds and expand reproduction, the Democratic Government has decided to help transport and sell stockpiled coal that could not be sold during the Chiang-occupied period. Coal yards will be set up in towns along the Zhangbo Railway to be responsible for sales. Of the first batch of 200 tons of stockpiled coal transported on behalf of Huadong and Dongfang mines, 50 tons of raw coal have been transported to Zhangdian area for sale. Jiang Kesheng of the Mining Association believes: "This move by the Democratic Government is better than any other help." In the two streets of Shuiwu and Xiye, where large businesses are concentrated in the city, except for more than ten households that have not formally opened, the rest have resumed business.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 14th: Salt production in the famous salt-producing areas of Shanxi and Huai'ren in northern Shanxi has greatly developed. In more than 50 villages in Shanxi, there are currently 300 salt pans boiling salt, and it is estimated that the annual salt production can reach 10 million jin. The Democratic Government has loaned a huge sum of 26 million yuan to support more than 300 salt workshops in production. The trade organs purchase finished products at fair market prices and transport them to various places, regulating production during slack and peak months, so that salt workers, charcoal workers, and transporters can all benefit. Seven salt pans in Bianzhuang Village, etc., earn a profit of 3.5 million yuan every day, and women and children participate in cleaning salt soil to obtain great profits. More than 160 farmers in Shanyinzhuang Village have earned more than 50 million yuan from sweeping soil in the past year, equivalent to 400 dan (each dan is 300 jin) of grain, which has become one of the main sources of income for the masses. According to the salt produced in Shanxi, Huai'ren and other places, it used to be supplied to the people in twenty or thirty counties in Shanxi, but due to the monopoly of Yan Xishan's "Jinbei Salt Affairs Supervision Office" and "Jinbei Salt Industry Bank," heavy taxes were imposed; during the Japanese occupation, the "Mengjiang Salt Association" controlled and blockaded, prohibiting production and trade, resulting in the closure of most salt workshops. After the People's Liberation Army liberated the area the previous autumn, the Democratic Government announced that the salt industry was tax-free, and salt workshops opened one after another, and output surged. After we recovered Huai'ren and other towns this time, the Democratic Government has decided to further restore and develop the salt industry.

　　民主政府贷款二亿元
  　博山民营工矿开工
    仅大奎山及博大矿日出煤百八十吨
    【新华社华东十六日电】博山市民主政府扶助民营工商矿业恢复生产。西河、博山、景明等十一个电磨、电石、玻璃等民营工厂与煤矿，得到贷款本币二万万元（每元合蒋匪法币五十元）及粮食五万斤后，均已开工生产。博大矿日产煤百吨，西河矿将梨子园、大奎山两采煤所全部修复，仅大奎山即日出八十余吨。电磨厂日产面粉八百斤，电石厂日产制品四百斤，玻璃公司日出成品一箱，铁工厂正赶制大批农具。此外，华东、东方、大成、瑞成四处煤矿，亦开始排水，筹备复工。民主政府为帮助各矿厂周转资金扩大再生产，决定帮助运销蒋占期间无法脱售之存煤，在张博铁路沿线各城镇设置煤栈，负责推销事宜。首批为华东、东方两矿代运之二百吨存煤中，已有原煤五十吨运至张店一带出售。矿业公会姜克生认为：“民主政府此举比什么帮助都好”。该市大商号集中的税务、西冶两街，除尚有十余户未正式营业外，其余都已复业。
    【新华社晋绥十四日电】晋北著名盐产区山阴、怀仁等地盐业生产，已获得很大发展。山阴五十余村，现有三百口盐锅熬盐，预计年可产盐一千万斤。民主政府曾贷放二千六百万元巨款，扶助三百余盐坊进行生产，贸易机关以市场公平价格购买成品运销各地，调剂淡旺月生产，使盐工、炭工、运输者均能获得利益。卞庄等村七口盐锅，每日赚利三百五十余万元，妇女儿童均参加打扫盐土获得厚利。山阴庄村一百六十余户农民，一年来扫土赚五千余万元，折合粮食四百大石（每石三百斤），成为群众主要收入之一。按山阴、怀仁等地出产之盐，以往供给晋二三十县人民食用，但因阎匪“晋北盐务督销处”、“晋北盐业银行”进行垄断，课以重税；日寇侵占期间，则以“蒙疆盐组合”统制封锁，禁止生产贸易，以致大部盐坊倒闭。前年秋解放军解放该地后，民主政府即宣布盐业无税，盐坊纷纷开业，产量激增。此次我收复怀仁等城镇后，民主政府已决定进一步恢复与发展盐业。
