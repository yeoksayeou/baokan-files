Temporarily Borrowing Fruit Land to Distribute to Poor Households
　　Harmoniously Resolving Specific Difficulties in Spring Plowing

　　[This article transmitted by] The Benbao [This Newspaper] News: In order to solve the difficulties in spring plowing, Heshan instructed districts and villages: 1. Regarding the existing fruit land issue in each village: After the movement, some fruit land in each village was not distributed. Some was occupied by cooperatives, some by armed militias, and some by village offices, village finance study fields. In addition, some villages did not distribute the fruit yields from last year's struggles. Looking at the whole county, this is indeed a large portion of land.

　　Cadres in each base point area leading production should go to each village to allocate these lands. First, they should understand the situation, and then lend them out separately, first to satisfy poor peasants, farm laborers, and other landless and land-poor peasants (including those middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against). Some districts only rely on village cadres to lend out the land, and the borrowers are often neither poor peasants and farm laborers who have not yet turned over, nor wrongly struggled middle peasants, but people who have turned over relatively well. For example, some people whose output has reached four shi per person can still borrow, while wrongly struggled middle peasants with less than two shi output have not borrowed. This problem must be solved immediately. If there are no problems, no further action is needed. If there are problems, such as unfair or unreasonable lending, it should be withdrawn and dealt with. Villages that have not started dealing with this issue at all must also deal with it immediately. When dealing with it, priority should be given to lending to those with low yields throughout the village (including wrongly struggled middle peasants). The borrower has the right to use the land, and the ownership will be determined later during equal distribution. In addition, in addition to land, each village also has some fruit and grain funds. District and village cadres should provide timely relief or loans to solve the spring famine.

　　2. Mutual Lending and Loan Issues: (1) In the past, the mutual lending in our county's rural areas was always that whoever had grain to eat was mobilized to lend it out, regardless of whether the lender agreed or not, especially only caring about lending and not about repayment. As a result, naturally, borrowing and lending decreased or stopped altogether, exacerbating the famine. In the future, in mutual lending, not only must we genuinely obtain the lender's consent, but also district and village cadres must guarantee repayment. Only in this way can we overcome the current difficulties and develop lending relationships. (2) In the past, our loans to villages did not sufficiently consider specific households. On the other hand, we emphasized the purpose of the loans, restricting the masses' use of them. For example, last year's loan, intended for buying donkeys, meant that some villagers borrowed 50,000 yuan, which was not enough to buy a donkey, so they kept the money at home for half a year without daring to use it. This approach is inappropriate. This year's spring loans and re-loans should overcome the above shortcomings and genuinely be lent to people with no or little capital (poor peasants, farm laborers, and wrongly struggled middle peasants). Now that the loans have been issued, some villages still do not allow wrongly struggled middle peasants to borrow, which is wrong. (Zhong Hai)

　　暂借果实地分给贫苦户
  　和顺解决春耕中具体困难
    【本报消息】和顺为解决春耕中困难，指示区村：一、各村现存果实地问题：各村经过运动，有一部果实地未分出去，有的是合作社占的，有的是武装民兵占的，还有的是村公所村财政学田所占，另外也有部分村庄去年斗出果实未分，全县来看，确是一大部分土地。
    领导生产的各基点区干部到各村分配这些土地，首先应了解情况，而后分别借出，先满足贫雇农及其他无地少地农民（错斗中农在内）。有的区只依靠村干部把地借出去，借地对象往往既不是未翻身的贫雇农，也不是错斗中农，而是翻身较好的人。比如，有的每人产量已达四石，还能借，而错斗中农不足二石产量却未借到。这个问题必须马上解决。没有问题的不另处理，如果有问题，借的不公平、不合理，应退出处理，根本没有着手处理的村，也须马上处理。处理时，应尽全村产量低的先借（错斗的中农在内）。借者有使用权，所有权以后平分时确定。另外，各村除地以外，还有些果实粮款，区村干部应适时的救济或借出，解决春荒。
    二、互借与贷款问题：（一）过去本县农村中的互借，一贯是谁有粮食吃，就动员一下借出来，本人是否同意，我们不管，特别是管借不管还。这样一来，自然借贷减少了，或根本不借了，扩大了灾荒，今后在互借中不但要真正取得出借户自愿，而且要区村干部保证归还，只有如此，才能克服当前困难，发展借贷关系。（二）过去我们的贷款到村对具体户照顾的不够，另方面是强调贷款用途，限制了群众使用。如去年贷款，因用途是买驴，老乡贷的五万元，不足买驴，放在家半年不敢用，这种作法是不妥当的。今年的春贷、转贷应克服过去上述缺点，真正贷给没资本或少资本的人（贫雇农与斗错的中农在内），现在贷款已发下，有些村错斗的中农仍不准贷，这是不对的。（忠海）
