　　Taihang Local Armed Forces Eliminate 300 Bandits
  　Chiang Kai-shek's Bandits Suffer Major Blow in Southern Invasion of Anyang
    [Report from this newspaper] Belated news: Following the recapture of Tangyin City, our Taihang and Ji'nan local armed forces annihilated over 300 bandits in the Liyuan and Huangcun areas between Anyang and Tangyin on the 29th of last month, seizing some small cannons and machine guns. At midnight on the 24th of last month, our Taihang and Ji'nan local armed forces captured Tangyin City in one fell swoop. The next day, they marched east, sweeping through strongholds such as Guxian, Taiyuan, Tanghuangcun, and Yangzhuang in the eastern and southeastern parts of Tangyin, completely cutting off the enemy's transportation line between Anyang and Xinxiang. This forced the enemy's 117th and 116th Regiments of the 40th Division, attempting to hold firmly onto important strongholds such as Guxian, to flee north and shrink back into Anyang City and its surrounding villages. By the 29th of last month, the enemy launched a counterattack in two directions, attempting to reoccupy Tangyin and Guxian, in order to reopen their transportation line between Anyang and Xinxiang. However, as soon as the enemy's 116th Regiment emerged, it was fiercely attacked by our local armed forces and forced to flee back. Another enemy force, two battalions of the 117th Regiment, was surrounded by us in the Liyuan and Huangcun areas south of Anyang, and one of its companies was completely annihilated. According to the results of this battle, 121 enemies were killed, 148 were wounded, and 67 were captured. Two small cannons, six light machine guns, five submachine guns, forty-one rifles, and two pistols were seized.
