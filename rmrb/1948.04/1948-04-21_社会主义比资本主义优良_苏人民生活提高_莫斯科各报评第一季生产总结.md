Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 19th: Moscow Dispatch: The newspapers here have all published important editorials on the first quarter production summary made by the Soviet State Planning Committee. "The achievements obtained in the first quarter of this year are the most remarkable since the war," reported Izvestia. "The exciting figures show the growth of metal, coal, oil, machinery manufacturing, and food production, and embody the heroic labor of the Soviet people." The newspaper announced, "The Soviet people have begun to fulfill the second quarter plan with amazing ability. They are full of determination to strive for even more remarkable achievements." Pravda wrote, "The great improvement in the living standards of the working people is a remarkable achievement of the Soviet people's movement to complete the post-war five-year plan, and is also a characteristic of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state's policy." Pravda pointed out that the 41% increase in the purchasing power of the ruble and the 51% increase in real wages in the first quarter of this year compared with the same quarter last year fully demonstrate the rapid development of the socialist economy, the growth of social wealth, and the guarantee of the welfare of the broad masses by socialism. Pravda made a clear comparison between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries, saying: "Now, as before the war, the Soviet Union ranks first in Europe in industrial production. In Europe, no capitalist country has been able to overcome the economic difficulties after the war. Although the United States has monopolistic capitalists who became rich in the war, it is currently facing the threat of an economic crisis. The result of post-war development is powerful new evidence that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system."

    莫斯科各报评第一季生产总结
    【新华社陕北十九日电】莫斯科讯：此间各报均就苏联国家计划委员会所作的第一季生产总结发表重要社论。消息报评道：“本年第一季所获得的如此显赫的成就，在战后还是第一次。令人兴奋的数字，表明了金属、煤、石油、机械制造及食品生产的增长，体现了苏维埃人民的英雄式劳动。”该报宣布：“苏联人民已以惊人的能力着手履行第二季计划。他们充满着坚定地争取更显赫成就的决心。”真理报写道：“劳动人民生活水平的大大改善，是苏联人民争取完成战后五年计划运动的显著成果，也是布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家政策的特色。”真理报指出本年第一季比去年同季，卢布购买力提高百分之四十一与实际工资增加百分之五十一，充分说明了社会主义经济发展的迅速，社会财富的增长，社会主义对广大群众福利的保证。真理报把苏联和资本主义国家作一番鲜明的对照说：“现在也如战前一样，在工业生产上，苏联占欧洲首位。在欧洲，没有一个资本主义国家能克服战后经济的困难。美国虽有着在战争中致富的独占资本家，但目前正面临着经济危机的威胁。战后发展的结果，是一个有力的新证据，证明社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越。”
