Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th: Nanjing, April 20th news: Over three thousand Shanghai-Nanjing Railway workers, in protest against the Chiang bandit Transportation Ministry's cancellation of the 30% cost of living allowance and all subsidies for railway workers, staged a full-scale work stoppage by lying down on the tracks for "over three hours" (Reuters). This caused this major transportation artery to come to a standstill. Only when Chiang bandit Road Police Chief Wang was forced to agree to a "satisfactory resolution" did the workers resume work.

    沪宁铁路工人三千人罢工
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】南京二十日消息：三千余沪宁铁路工人为抗议蒋匪交通部取消铁路工人百分之三十的生活补助费及一切津贴，全体卧轨罢工“达三小时以上”（路透社）。使此一主要交通动脉顿时陷于停顿，直至蒋匪路警总队长王某被迫答应“圆满解决问题”时，工人始复工。
