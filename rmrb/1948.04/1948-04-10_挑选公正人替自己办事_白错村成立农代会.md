　　Selecting Impartial People to Work for Themselves
  　Baicuo Village Establishes Farmers' Representative Assembly
    [Shahe News] After rectifying the Party and democratically classifying class status in Baicuo Village, Shahe Fourth District, the village proceeded to formally establish a Farmers' Representative Assembly. First, small groups discussed and studied the nature of the Farmers' Representative Assembly and what it should do, so that every farmer had a deep understanding of it. There were a total of 418 middle and poor farmers, men and women, over the age of eighteen in the village, and they decided to elect 17 representatives.

    When the small groups were nominating candidates, some people showed favoritism and clannish sentiments. After discussion, the majority advocated breaking away from favoritism and clan ties, understanding people from a political perspective, and temporarily forming groups by mixing men and women from different streets. Fifty-two candidates were nominated (39 men and 13 women, including 4 Party members); in terms of class status, there were 8 poor farmers, 30 new middle farmers, and 14 middle farmers. These candidates were moved by the enthusiasm of the masses. Some made election-style self-criticisms. For example, Zhao Bingyin, who gambled once this year, said: If I am elected this time, I will never do this bad thing again. Those with shortcomings expressed their determination to correct them.

    On the morning of the 26th, an election meeting was held. The masses voted very carefully. Hao Yulin secretly wrote the names of the people he favored on his palm. Zhao San shaded his eyes with his hands, carefully looking for the candidates, muttering unconsciously: We can't be careless, we can't be careless. As a result of the election, 17 people including Guo Yulai were elected. Wu Dashuan, who was upright, fair, and had been a hired laborer for more than 30 years, the poor farmer Guo Yulai, and the woman Yang Mang received the most votes.

    The next day, the results were discussed during production. The general response was: This is true democracy, selecting good people from good people. All that was selected was the bone, the best. Li Mingsan said: Our seventeen representatives may not look extraordinary, but they can handle our affairs fairly. Yang Focheng said: Picking good people from these seventeen is like picking melons from melons, the more you pick, the more dazzling you get (all are good, there is no way to choose). From the seventeen, a presidium of nine people was selected, seven men and two women (one male and one female Party member each). The masses were very enthusiastic and welcomed the presidium to speak. Guo Yulai said: I can't speak well. The villagers elected me, but I really don't understand anything. I am like a beast of burden, and you are like the cart drivers. Wherever you point the whip, I will pull. The masses interrupted his speech with a burst of applause. Then Wang Ting said: I am a Party member, and I should be a long-term worker for the masses. I didn't do well in the past, but I will definitely do well in the future. Hu Dicheng was a middle farmer who had been working for a long time, and was fair and selfless. He smiled as soon as he opened his mouth and said: After the Land Law was promulgated, I was afraid. This time I was elected to the presidium, and my heart is finally at ease. Middle farmers also have a voice! This world can be considered correct!

    After this election, the masses were very satisfied, and the whole village was full of a new democratic atmosphere. (Baicuo Work Group)

　　挑选公正人替自己办事
  　白错村成立农代会
    【沙河消息】沙河四区白错村经整党民主划阶级后，接着酝酿正式成立农民代表委员会。首先小组讨论研究农代会的性质、干些啥事，使每个农民都对农代会有了深刻的认识。该村十八岁以上的中贫农男女共四百一十八人，大家决定要选代表十七人。
    在小组提候选人名单时，有些人表现有远近情面等宗派情绪，经讨论，多数人主张要打破情面与姓氏宗派，从政治上去认识人，不论男女、街道，混合起来临时编成组。提出候选人五十二个（男三十九、女十三，内有党员四）；从成份上看，贫农八、新中农卅、中农十四。这些候选人为群众热情所感动，有些作了竞选式的检讨，如赵炳寅今年赌过一次钱，他说：这次要选上，我决不再做这坏事。有些毛病的都表示决心改过。
    二十六日上午举行选举大会，群众选的非常细心，郝玉林把自己心上的人名字暗记在手掌上，赵三的双手打着凉蓬，细找候选人，嘴里不知不觉的喃喃着：可不能马虎，可不能马虎。选举结果，郭雨来等十七人当选。为人正派、公正、当了三十多年雇工的武大拴、贫农郭雨来、妇女杨忙的三人得票最多。
    第二天在生产中酝酿了一天，总的反映是：这才是真正民主，从好人里头选好人，抽的尽是骨头，李明三说：咱这十七个代表，看人样可不出奇，可是能给咱办公道事。杨佛成说：这十七个人内再挑好人，好比瓜里拣瓜，越拣眼越花（都不错，没法挑的意思）。十七人中又选出主席团九个人，男七、女二（男女党员各一），群众热情很高，都欢迎主席团讲话。郭雨来说：我不会说话，乡亲们选我，我实在不懂啥，我好比个牲口，你们好比赶车的，你们鞭子指到那里，我拉到那里。群众一阵掌声，打断了他的讲话。接着王廷的说：我是个党员，应该给群众当长工，过去没干好，今后一定好好干。胡底成是个长年劳动，公正无私的中农，他一开口就笑，他说：土地法公布后，我心里害怕，这次选我为主席团，我心可落了底，中农也有说话地位呀！这世道可算归正了。
    经过这次选举，群众都很满意，全村充满民主新气象。（白错工作组）
