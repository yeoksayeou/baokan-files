　　News from Yuan Dynasty: In Dong Quanshan, District One, the village cadres used to force the division of groups and teams. Now, they haven't explained the benefits of mutual aid thoroughly to the masses, causing separation between those with livestock and those without. Households with livestock feel that voluntary mutual aid is good, but they are unwilling to provide mutual aid to those without livestock, fearing losses. The land-poor households with manpower but no livestock feel that the past mutual aid was unreasonable and are unwilling to participate in mutual aid again, thinking it's better to just collapse. Widows, widowers, and orphans are waiting for care, thinking it's the task of the higher authorities. Li Zi, a newly emerging middle peasant, is afraid of losses and doesn't provide mutual aid to those without livestock. Based on the masses' thinking, a general meeting of all Party members was held on the evening of the 15th. Each person reviewed their shortcomings in production. The district cadre explained that leading production is the Party's task, and good Party members should serve the masses in production. Erroneous Party member cadres should make amends and perform meritorious service in production. All Party members also discussed how to work in production. 1. Party members should regularly publicize the benefits of production mutual aid and the Outline Land Law to dispel the masses' ideological concerns. 2. Party members should set an example in production mutual aid, taking the lead in uniting the masses as the backbone. 3. Party members with livestock should lead households with livestock to actively combine with those without livestock; Party members without livestock should lead households without livestock to actively combine with households with livestock for mutual aid. This way, both sides are proactive, and no one suffers losses. The free combination of those with and without livestock will solve the difficulties of poor and hired laborers in plowing and livestock, so as to achieve the goal of increased production.
    After the publicity, another symposium of sixty-nine households without livestock was held the next day to review the thinking of relying on care and waiting for surrogacy, and that in production those without livestock should actively combine with those with livestock, exchanging manpower or grass for livestock power, so as not to cause losses to both sides.
    On the third day, after publicity and deliberation by households without livestock, a joint conference of farmers and women was held to explain the benefits of mutual aid, but it must be voluntary. Those with livestock provide animal power, and those without livestock provide manpower. You help me, and I help you, so that neither is harmed, and friendship is promoted. In the discussion, the masses were very happy and said: "We didn't understand it thoroughly before, and we only thought it was the same as the previous mutual aid! Now that we understand the benefits of mutual aid, we can't survive without mutual aid, and mutual aid is still good." After deliberation and the active leadership of Party members, households with and without livestock actively combined into twenty-five mutual aid groups, totaling one hundred and eighty-five households (out of two hundred and twenty-four households in the whole village).
    In plowing and sowing, the masses also planned: 1. The livestock will be used for two xiang each time to make it more efficient. 2. Strive to reduce the use of livestock for milling rice and grinding flour for households that feed livestock. 3. Call on women to help each other to push millstones and participate in agricultural labor. 4. When it gets hot, all villagers should make more manure. 5. Blackboards and loudspeakers should be used, and elementary schools should cooperate to compile rhythmic ballads in a timely manner to commend production models and criticize lazy people.

　　党员带头自愿结合
  　东劝善互助解决畜力困难
    【元朝消息】一区东劝善，过去村干部包办强制划组、编队，现在又没把互助好处给群众解释透彻，造成了有牲口与没牲口的隔离开，有牲口的户觉着自愿互助哩，不愿给没牲口的互助，怕吃亏。没畜力有人力的少地户，认为过去的互助不合理，不愿再互助，还不如倒地咧。人畜力都没有的鳏寡孤独等待照顾，认为是上级的公事。新兴中农李兹，怕吃亏不给没牲口的互助。根据群众的思想，十五号晚召开了全体党员大会，每人检讨在生产中的毛病，区干说明领导生产是党的任务，好党员应该在生产中给群众办事，有错误的党员干部应该在生产中改过立功。全体党员又讨论出在生产中怎样工作。一、党员经常宣传生产互助好处，和土地法大纲，解开群众的思想顾虑。二、党员在生产互助中以身作则，带头团结群众作骨干。三、有牲口的党员带领有牲口的户，主动和没牲口的结合；没牲口的党员带领没牲口的户，主动去结合有牲口的户互助，这样两面主动、双不吃亏，有牲口与没牲口的自由结合，解决贫雇耕畜困难，才能达到增产目的。
    经过宣传，第二天又召开了六十九户没牲口的座谈会，检讨依靠照顾等待代耕思想，在生产中没牲口的应该主动结合有畜力的，以人力或草换畜力，双不吃亏。
    第三天经过没牲口户宣传酝酿，又召开了农、妇联合大会，说明互助的好处，但一定要自愿，有牲口的畜力，没牲口的人力，你帮我，我帮你，两不被害，发扬友爱。在讨论中群众都是很高兴的说：“咱先没听透，还只当给那先互助一样咧！这听透了互助好处，不互助不活便，还是互助好。”经过酝酿和党员的积极带头，有牲口及没牲口的主动结合了二十五个互助组，计一百八十五户（全村二百二十四户）。
    在翻土下种中，群众又计划：一、牲口改两晌使活。二、争取喂牲口的户少使牲口碾米、磨面。三、号召妇女互助起来推碾磨，参加农业劳动。四、天热了全村群众要多造粪。五、黑板报广播筒都使用起来，由小学配合及时编出快板歌谣，表扬生产模范批评懒人。
