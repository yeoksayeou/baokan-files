Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 8th: Carpenters and masons in Shijiazhuang have organized three cooperatives in the east and west of the bridge, with more than 300 workers participating, collectively contracting for house repairs and construction. The cooperative is organized according to the "small contract" custom. Major jobs are jointly inspected by union cadres and group leaders, who negotiate the required number of workdays. Based on six catties of rice per workday for major work and five catties of rice for minor work, a contract is signed with the employer. The work is then divided into several parts, contracted to a certain number of people according to the number of workdays. Any work saved is recorded by union cadres at any time according to the enthusiasm and intensity of labor, and extra rewards are given to improve labor enthusiasm. For example, carpenter Wang Jinsheng did twenty-two workdays at a certain place, and in addition to receiving the regular rice for the workdays, he also received a surplus dividend of 71,500 yuan (calculated in border currency, same below) (the price of rice at that time was 1,200 yuan per catty). There are three benefits to workers organizing: (1) Workers participating in the cooperative have guaranteed work, and the union unifies the contracting of work for everyone to do. (2) The more actively they work, the more money they earn. Some workers can earn the equivalent of two workdays of rice a day, earning twenty to thirty thousand yuan. (3) No matter where they work, under the education and care of the union, workers work conscientiously and their efficiency greatly increases.

　　石家庄木瓦工人组织劳力合作社
    【新华社晋察冀八日电】石家庄市木瓦工人于桥东桥西分别组织三个合作社，已有三百余工人参加，集体包工修房盖屋。合作社是根据“小包干”习惯组织起来的。大活都由工会干部及小组长去共同看验，商量出所需工数。按大工每工六斤米，小工五斤米计，与雇主订立合同，做活中并分出几部分，按工数由一定人数包做，省出工来，按工作积极情绪及劳动强度，由工会干部随时记出，分别予以额外奖励，以提高劳动热情。如木工王金声在某处做了二十二个工，除得正工米外，即分超余红利（以边币计，下同）七万一千五百元（当时米价一千二百元一斤），工人组织起来有三个好处：（一）工人参加合作社，做活有了保障，工会统一包下活大家做。（二）劳动越积极分的钱越多，有的工人一天能分两个工的米，可得两三万元。（三）不论在哪里做工，工人在工会教育与照管下，工作认真，效率大增。
