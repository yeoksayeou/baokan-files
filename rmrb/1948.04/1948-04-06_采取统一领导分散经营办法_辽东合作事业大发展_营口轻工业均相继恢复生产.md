　　Adopting a Unified Leadership and Decentralized Management Approach
  　Liaodong's Cooperative Enterprises are Greatly Developing
    Yingkou's Light Industries are Gradually Resuming Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st dispatch] Rural cooperative enterprises in various parts of Liaodong are developing rapidly. In order to overcome the spring famine, Langtou District of Andong City, under the leadership of the Farmers' Association and the mass cooperative, has organized 2,483 households (accounting for 63% of the total number of households) in the past three months to engage in production work such as weaving, making grass bags, weaving mats, fishing, and transportation. Transportation alone has brought back 270,000 catties of grain and 80,000 catties of salt, bringing great benefits to the masses. The cooperative has 51,000 shares with a total capital of 139 million yuan (each yuan is equivalent to 50 yuan of Kuomintang currency in Guannei). In terms of organization, a unified leadership and decentralized management approach is adopted. A unified organization is established throughout the district, and production is led by the production committees of each street, which is flexible and saves manpower and material resources. The cooperative has lent 12,000 catties of grain, 35,000 catties of salt, 20,000 catties of Japonica grass, and other items such as kerosene to help the masses in their production. Since its development in December last year, the Linjiang County Cooperative has increased from 42 to 86, and its capital has also increased from 102 million yuan to 544.5 million yuan. Among them, poor and hired peasants account for 82% of the shares, and other middle peasants account for 18%. The stores and small factories under the jurisdiction of the cooperative have reached 170 units. At present, the cooperatives in the county are actively preparing seeds and farm tools to meet the needs of farmers for spring plowing. The Hongtuya District Cooperative has bought back more than 20 head of livestock. The People's Cooperative of Badaojiang District has prepared 50,000 catties of grain, 800 catties of barley seeds, 10,000 catties of salt, and some buckwheat seeds. The Northeast Bank of the county has decided to lend 60 million yuan to help villages that have not yet established cooperatives to establish cooperatives.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd dispatch] Various light industries in Yingkou have successively resumed production. The Yingkou Textile Factory has started operation a few days ago, and the Qidong Tobacco Company and Sanmin Match Company will also resume work recently. Before liberation, more than half of the people in the city were in a state of starvation. They could only eat one meal of bean cake a day, or fill their stomachs with miscellaneous vegetables and bran. In December last year alone, more than 200 people in Tongzhi District 1 died of freezing and starvation, and even those with small assets were often hungry. After conducting in-depth visits and investigations in various streets, the democratic government has allocated 470,000 catties of grain to provide emergency relief to more than 10,000 starving people.

　　采取统一领导分散经营办法
  　辽东合作事业大发展
    营口轻工业均相继恢复生产
    【新华社东北一日电】辽东各地农村合作事业发展甚快。安东市浪头区为克服春荒，在农会及群众合作社领导下，三个月来共组织二千四百八十三户（占总户数百分之六十三）群众从事纺织、制草包、编席、打鱼、运输等生产工作，仅运输一项即已运回粮食二十七万斤，食盐八万斤，群众获利极大。该社已有股票五万一千股，股金一万万三千九百万元（每元合关内蒋币五十元）。在组织上采取统一领导，分散经营的办法，全区成立统一的组织，通过各街生产委员领导生产，指挥灵便，又可节省人力物力。该社在帮助群众生产中曾贷出粮食一万二千斤、盐三万五千斤、粳草二万斤及其他火油等物。临江县合作社，自去年十二月发展迄今，已由四十二个增加到八十六个，资金亦由一万万零二百万元增加到五万万四千五百余万元。其中贫雇农股份占百分之八十二，其他中农等占百分之十八。合作社所管辖的商店及小型工厂，已达一百七十个单位。目前该县各合作社正积极准备种子、农具以供农民春耕需要。红土崖区合作社买回牲口二十余头。八道江区人民合作社准备粮食五万斤、大麦种八百斤、食盐一万斤，及一部荞麦种。该县东北银行决定贷款六千万元，帮助未建立合作社的各村成立合作社。
    【新华社东北二日电】营口各种轻工业相继恢复生产，营口纺织厂已于日前开工，启东烟草公司及三民火柴公司最近亦可复工。该市解放前有一半以上人民陷于饥馑，他们每天只能吃一顿豆饼，或以杂菜糠皮果腹。去年腊月仅同治一区就有二百多人冻饿而死，就是小有资产者亦多挨饿。民主政府经深入各街闾访问调查后，已拨出粮食四十七万斤，对一万余饥民进行急救。
