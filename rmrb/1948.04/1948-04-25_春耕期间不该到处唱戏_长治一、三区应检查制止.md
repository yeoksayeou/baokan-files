Singing Operas Everywhere During Spring Plowing is Inappropriate
	Changzhi First and Third Districts Should Inspect and Stop It
To the Editors:
	This spring, due to the ideological obstacles of cadres lying down on the job and the masses waiting, the preparations for spring plowing were very poor, and the livelihood of the land and the people suffered a great deal. Currently, after ideological mobilization in various places, people have generally broken through their concerns and started to move, but many villages are vigorously staging operas. In Changzhi's Third District, Zhonghe and Donghe villages are less than a mile apart. Zhonghe just finished singing for four or five days, and Donghe is about to start again. Beixianquan sings for six days straight. Such a big commotion not only wastes financial resources and increases the burden on the masses, but more importantly, the wasted labor cannot be compensated. March and April are months with relatively many temple fairs in various places. If necessary measures are not taken to stop them, it will inevitably affect spring plowing and sowing. I believe that, except for mule and horse agricultural tool fairs that are beneficial to production and can be organized in a planned manner, general singing performances should be resolutely stopped before spring plowing and sowing. Is this correct? Let everyone study it.
	In addition, I have a point to make regarding the content of the performances: After the People's Theater Troupe performed "Li Youcai's Ballads" in Hanjiao Village, Changzhi on the evening of April 9th, cadres said in fear: "Anyway, we can't escape this." The masses also reflected: "If this is performed, who hasn't seen someone getting beaten?" At the same time, they became suspicious of today's policies. Fortunately, Comrade Jia from the county party committee was present that evening and immediately made an explanation after the closing, clarifying today's policies, which brought stability. The script of "Li Youcai's Ballads" was indeed a famous play in the past and was welcomed by the masses, but today, some of its content is inconsistent with the spirit of the policies. I suggest that the comrades leading the theater troupe pay attention and review and revise your repertoire one by one according to the current policies before performing it.

To the Editors:
	This spring came early, and thunder came early. Frost will definitely come early as well. The masses generally demand early sowing. However, in many villages in Changzhi First and Third Districts, spring plowing work is being relaxed, and the masses are not being properly organized for production. Some villages have not resolved many problems left over from last year's mutual aid groups, but are busy staging operas. The Agricultural and Forestry Group visited Changzhi First District on the twelfth of this month and found four villages singing in the twelve villages they visited. For example: Xiaochangchun, Dianshang, Yangbao, Beitou, and both the North and South Jinliangsi villages are also preparing to sing. The content of the operas is mostly old. We suggest that singing operas be stopped immediately, and that the demands of the masses for production be grasped to immediately rectify mutual aid and launch the spring plowing and sowing campaign.

### 春耕期间不该到处唱戏　长治一、三区应检查制止

　　春耕期间不该到处唱戏
  　长治一、三区应检查制止编辑同志：
    今春由于干部躺倒与群众等待等思想障碍，春耕准备工作很差，地土生活摆下很多。目前各地经过思想发动后，一般打破了顾虑，开始动起来，但不少村庄又在大闹唱戏。长治三区中和与东和两村相距不足一里，中和才唱过四、五天，东和又要闹唱。北仙泉一连就唱六天。这样的大闹，不但浪费财力加重群众负担，重要的还是劳力浪费无法补偿。三四月里是各地庙会比较要多的月份，如不做必要的停止，势必影响春耕下种。我意见除有利生产的骡马农具会，可以有计划的组织外，一般的演唱，在春耕下种前应坚决停止。对不对大家研究。
    另外对演剧的内容上，也有一点意见：人民剧团四月九号晚在长治韩店村演出“李有才板话”之后，干部害怕的说：反正躲不过这一手。群众也这样反映：演这啦，谁还没有见过个打人。同时对今天的政策起了疑心。幸亏当晚有县委贾同志在场，闭幕后马上做了解释，讲明今天的政策之后，才安定下来。李有才板话剧本过去确实是名剧，是群众所欢迎的，可是在今天，有些内容就与政策精神不符。我建议领导剧团的同志注意，要根据当前的政策，将你们的剧目一一审查修正后再演出。
　　读者　段国宝编辑同志：
    今年春浅，开雷早，下霜一定也要早，群众普遍要求早种。但在长治一、三区有很多村庄对春耕工作放松，不好好组织群众生产，有些村去年互助组遗留不少问题不去解决，却忙于唱戏。农林组在本月十二日到长治一区，到过十二村庄，就有四个村在唱。如：小长春、店上、杨堡、北头、南北津良寺两村也准备要唱。戏的内容大半是旧的。我们建议赶快停止唱戏，应掌握群众生产要求立即整顿互助，开展春耕下种运动。
