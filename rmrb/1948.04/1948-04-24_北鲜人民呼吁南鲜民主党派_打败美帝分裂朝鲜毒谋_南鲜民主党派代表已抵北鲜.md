Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 21st: According to TASS, Pyongyang: North Korean parties and people's organizations recently sent a letter to various democratic parties and organizations in South Korea, calling for united action to defeat the conspiracy of the US occupation forces and their henchmen in South Korea to form a puppet government. The appeal stated: The US imperialist plot to dismember Korea has reached its most dangerous stage. Under the instigation of the US, South Korea is preparing to hold the so-called "National Government" divisive election on May 10th to create a situation of complete political and economic division in Korea. The US military authorities in South Korea are now using the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea as a cover to select reactionary elements and pro-Japanese traitors to organize a puppet government to serve the US imperialist enslavement rule. The Temporary Commission on Korea is assisting the US in trying to turn Korea back into a colony. The appeal further suggested: Convene a joint meeting of democratic parties and organizations from North and South Korea in Pyongyang this month to discuss the new domestic situation, formulate a concrete unified program, and call on the people of North and South Korea to unite to defeat the reactionaries' division of Korea and accelerate the establishment of an independent, unified, and free Korea. The appeal finally advocated that after foreign troops withdraw from Korea, a democratic national referendum should be held to elect a parliament and government that truly represents the interests of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 21st: Pyongyang: Various South Korean parties and organizations participating in the People's Democratic Front held a special meeting in Seoul, enthusiastically supporting the appeal of North Korean parties and people's organizations. Many political parties and organizations have announced their willingness to participate in the Pyongyang meeting. It is reported that the Soviet military authorities in North Korea have agreed to allow representatives of South Korean democratic parties to enter North Korea. Representatives of many South Korean people's organizations have broken through the heavy blockade of the US military authorities in South Korea and traveled to Pyongyang to attend the meeting. The impact of the appeal has greatly alarmed the US military authorities in South Korea. In addition to sending more military police and sentry posts to the key roads at the border between North and South Korea, in an attempt to block the northward South Korean representatives, they have also dispatched special agents and plainclothes military police from the "North-South Youth League" and other organizations to search door-to-door, forcing every resident of South Korea to affix their private seals on the false election list to express their consent to the false election. Those who refuse will be persecuted on the grounds of sympathizing with the Communist Party.

　　北鲜人民呼吁南鲜民主党派
  　打败美帝分裂朝鲜毒谋
    南鲜民主党派代表已抵北鲜
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据塔斯社平壤讯：北鲜党派与人民团体日前曾致函南鲜各民主党派和团体，呼吁一致行动，以击溃南鲜美占领军及其爪牙筹组傀儡政府的阴谋活动。该呼吁书略称：美帝国主义企图肢解朝鲜的毒计，已进到最危险的阶段。在美帝唆使下，南鲜正准备于五月十日举行所谓“国民政府”的分裂选举，以造成朝鲜政治经济全面分裂的局面。南鲜美军当局现利用联合国临时朝鲜委员会为掩护，选派反动分子和亲日奸匪组织傀儡政府，以便替美帝奴役统治服务；而临时朝鲜委员会则协助美帝，想把朝鲜重沦为殖民地。呼吁书继建议：于本月内在平壤召开南北鲜各民主党派团体联席会议，讨论国内新局势，制定具体统一的纲领，号召南北鲜人民团结起来，为挫败反动派分裂朝鲜及加速建立独立统一自由的朝鲜而斗争。呼吁书最后力主在外国军队撤出朝鲜后，举行民主的全民投票选出，以真正代表人民利益的议会和政府。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】平壤讯：参加人民民主阵线的南鲜诸党派团体，曾在汉城举行特别会议，热烈拥护北鲜党派与人民团体的呼吁书。许多政党团体并已宣布愿意参加平壤会议。据悉，北鲜苏军当局已答应南鲜民主党派代表进入北鲜。许多南鲜人民团体代表已冲破南鲜美军当局的重重封锁，跋涉至平壤出席会议。呼吁书影响所及，已使南鲜美军当局大为恐慌，除已在南北鲜交界处要道增派军警、哨岗，妄图拦阻北上之南鲜代表外，并出动“南北青年同盟”等特务和便衣宪警，挨户搜查，强迫南鲜每一居民在伪选举名单上盖私章，以表示同意伪选，违者就加以同情共产党罪名，肆行迫害。
