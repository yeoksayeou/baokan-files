Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Moscow dispatch: Amidst the labor emulation campaign launched by Soviet workers to "complete the Five-Year Plan in four years," Ural bricklayer S. Sistakov and his two assistants created a new world record by laying 28,700 bricks in eight hours. Soviet bricklayers have greatly exceeded production plans. For example, Sinivipov and Kovalev of Stalingrad, and Shariugin and Orlov of Moscow have completed the entire Five-Year Plan and continue to work for the 1951 plan. This is of great significance to the unprecedented construction endeavor undertaken by the Soviet people to rebuild their homes. The amazing productivity created by the selfless labor of Soviet construction workers is also due to the mechanization of the construction process. When building large houses, railway tracks are laid around the site, and powerful tower cranes lift bricks, stones, and wood, while small transfer machines automatically deliver them directly to the workers, greatly reducing and saving the workers' labor and movements. Sistakov's team used such machines to lay 2,000 large cement bricks in eight hours, completing the work that originally required thirty skilled manual bricklayers.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Moscow dispatch: The Soviet light industry has completed the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule, vividly illustrating the great improvement in the lives of the Soviet people. As of the end of last month, the textile industry had exceeded the plan by 3 percent, an increase of 35 percent over the same quarter last year. The linen textile industry performed particularly well, with each factory increasing production by 46 percent over last year, the cotton textile industry by 40 percent, and the woolen textile industry by 31 percent. The food industry exceeded the plan by 8 percent, with bread and macaroni increasing by 50 percent over the same period last year, sugar by more than 50 percent, confectionery by 61 percent, and canned food by as much as 81 percent. In the footwear industry, the output of rubber shoes in the first quarter of this year increased by 70 percent compared with the same quarter last year, leather shoes by 23 percent, and stockings by 48 percent. This year, 150 factories in the industry will be completed and put into operation, and the latest high-speed sewing machines will be used to increase labor productivity by 10 percent.

### 苏联乌拉尔砌砖工人　创造世界最高纪录　轻工业超过第一季计划

　　苏联乌拉尔砌砖工人
  　创造世界最高纪录
  　轻工业超过第一季计划
    【新华社陕北十日电】莫斯科讯：在苏联工人为“争取四年完成五年计划”而展开的劳动大竞赛声中，乌拉尔砌砖工人西斯大可夫和他的两个助手，又以八小时砌砖二万八千七百块而创造世界最高纪录。苏联砌砖工人已大大超过生产计划，其中如斯大林格勒的辛尼维波夫与科华列夫，莫斯科的沙里乌金与奥洛夫已完成全部五年计划，并继续为一九五一年的计划而工作。这对于苏联人民为重建其家园而进行的规模空前的建筑事业，具有重大意义。苏联建筑工人这种忘我劳动所创造的惊人生产率，同时应归功于建筑过程的机械化。在建筑大房子时，周围都铺设有铁轨，强大有力的塔形起重机巡回举起砖石木料，小型的转运机又自动把它直送到工人面前，因而大大减轻并节约了工人的劳力和动作，西斯大可夫班就是利用这样的机器而在八小时内砌好了二千块大洋灰砖，完成了原来要三十个熟练手工砌砖工人才做得了的工作。
    【新华社陕北十日电】莫斯科讯：苏联轻工业已提前完成今年第一季生产计划，生动说明苏联人民生活已大获改善。截至上月底止，纺织工业已超过计划百分之三，比去年同季产量增加达百分之三十五之多。其中麻纺织业成绩尤佳，每个工厂产量都比去年增加百分之四十六，棉纺织业增加百分之四十，毛纺织业增加百分之三十一，食品工业已超过计划百分之八，其中面包与通心粉比去年同期产量增加百分之五十，食糖增加百分之五十强，糖果增加百分之六十一，罐头食品竟增加达百分之八十一。鞋袜工业方面，今年第一季胶鞋产量较去年同季增加百分之七十，皮鞋增加百分之二十三，长统袜增加百分之四十八。该业今年将有一百五十个工厂修建落成，并将应用最新式的高速缝纫机，以提高劳动生产率百分之十。
