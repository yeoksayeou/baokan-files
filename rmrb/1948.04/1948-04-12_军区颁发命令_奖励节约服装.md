　　Military Region Issues Order
  　Rewards Clothing Conservation
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to alleviate the burden on the people and conserve clothing, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region has issued the following order: The clothing conservation system of past years has had considerable success in rewarding conservation, but there are also many personnel who do not fully understand its significance, or who hold selfish views, regarding the conservation system as a personal trading relationship with the public. When price changes cause the conservation price to be lower than the market price, they do not hand over the conserved clothing to the public in exchange for conservation allowances, but arbitrarily take it to the market to sell, creating a chaotic phenomenon of indiscriminate sale of public property. And when price changes cause the conservation price to be higher than the market price, they do not claim clothing, but receive conservation allowances and go to the market to buy clothing themselves, intentionally taking advantage of the public.

    In order to overcome the above abuses, truly implement conservation, reduce the burden on the people, and support the long-term war, the following provisions are made, in the hope that all personnel will be earnestly educated and conscientiously implement them!

    1. All clothing, shoes, and socks issued by the public are strictly prohibited from being sold. 2. In order to reward conservation, those who hand over conserved clothing to the public will be given the following bonuses per item: Single hat, 4 jin of millet; single garment, 15 jin of millet; single trousers, 10 jin of millet; shoes, 10 jin of millet per pair; socks, 5 jin of millet per pair; towel, 2 jin of millet. 3. The clothing conserved by each unit should obtain a receipt from the supply agency, and receive the bonus based on the price of millet at the time of clothing issuance.

　　军区颁发命令
  　奖励节约服装
    【本报消息】晋冀鲁豫军区为减轻人民负担，节约服装，特颁发命令如下：历年来的节约服装制度在奖励节约上有不少成绩，但也有不少人员，对其意义不甚明了，或抱自私观点，把节约制度看成个人对公家之买卖关系，当物价变动到节约价格低于市价时，不将节约服装交公换取节约代金，而任意拿到市场上去卖，造成乱卖公物之混乱现象，而当物价变动到节约价格高于市价时，则又不领服装，而领取节约代金，到市场去另买服装，有意投公家之机。
    为克服上述流弊，真正履行节约，减轻人民负担，支援长期战争，特作如下规定，望切实教育全体人员认真执行！
    一、凡属公家发给之服装鞋袜一律严禁出卖。二、为奖励节约，凡节约的服装交公者按件给予如下之奖金：单帽一顶小米四斤，单衣一件小米十五斤，单裤一条小米十斤，鞋子一双小米十斤，袜子一双小米五斤，毛巾一条小米二斤。三、各单位节约之服装，应取得供给机关之收据，并按发服装时之米价领取奖金。
