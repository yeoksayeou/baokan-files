Our powerful spring offensive launched by the East China People's Liberation Army against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shandong has left the bandits unable to retaliate. When we attacked Zichuan, bandit Wang Yaowu sent five brigades from eastern Jinan to aid and reinforce the east. From the 19th to the 23rd of last month, we annihilated over 1,500 of them in five days, and they scurried back like a wounded dog with its tail between its legs. Our army's vanguard has reached a place thirty miles away from Jinan. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Jiaodong were even more frightened. On the 28th, they fled from Longkou and Penglai. On the 30th, a brigade of Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched in the naval port of Weihaiwei also boarded ships and fled. Now, only the two cities of Yantai and Fushan remain on the coast of the Bohai Sea, and they have long been besieged by us. If they don't flee, they won't escape annihilation!

　　胶东蒋匪吓得乱跑
    咱们华东人民解放军向山东蒋匪发动的强大春季攻势，把蒋匪打得不能还手。咱们攻打淄川的时候，王匪耀武派了五个旅从济东出来向东援救，从上月十九号到二十三号，五天消灭了它一千五百多，象一个被打伤的狗一样又夹着尾巴窜回去了。咱们军队前锋又到了离济南三十里的地方。这时胶东蒋匪更显得害怕，二十八号从龙口和蓬莱逃跑了，三十号困守在军港威海卫的蒋匪一个旅也坐上轮船跑了。现北海边上只剩下烟台和福山两个城市，早被咱们围困住了，不是逃跑，也逃不过被消灭掉！
