Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Rangoon dispatch: The All-Burma Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting here on the 27th, at which Burmese Communist leader Thakin Than Tun delivered a speech, calling on the workers and the masses to unite and strive for the democratization of Burma and the establishment of a government that fully represents the people. Thakin Than Tun vehemently criticized the policy of the right-wing leaders of the Freedom League in assisting foreign imperialists and domestic big capitalists to continue consolidating their power in Burma. He said: The government is oppressing the Burmese people and serving imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie. After the meeting, the representatives of the meeting joined with the workers of Rangoon in a demonstration. Also: Workers of the Burma Oil Company went on strike on the 27th, and the Burmese authorities hurriedly announced a 24-hour curfew in the area around the oil company and power station on the 28th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: Rangoon dispatch: The struggle between democracy and reaction in Burma is intensifying. The four major foreign-funded (mainly British-funded) companies in Rangoon, including the Burma Oil Company, have been brought to a standstill due to the workers' strike that has lasted for several days. News of mass "disturbances" has also been reported from other parts of Burma. This situation has made the Burmese reactionary authorities, who are subservient to foreign imperialism, restless and eager to carry out suppression by means of fascist terror. Before dawn on the 28th, the police carried out arrests throughout Rangoon, attempting to destroy the leading organ of the Burmese people's democratic movement—the headquarters of the Burmese Communist Party. On the same day, "all roads from Rangoon to the interior were blocked, the police monitored railways and waterways, and a tense atmosphere enveloped the city. Markets and shops were closed, and churchgoers hurried home, not participating in the usual Easter (i.e., March 28th) ceremonies. News was also censored" (Associated Press), and the Burmese Communist Party and other democratic newspapers were illegally closed down. However, the authorities' attempt to intimidate the Burmese people with this kind of terror has obviously not achieved their premeditated goal, and the strike is still ongoing.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Rangoon dispatch: The attempt by the Burmese reactionary authorities, acting on the orders of foreign imperialists, to search for and arrest Burmese Communist leader Thakin Than Tun on the 28th has completely failed. It is reported that Thakin Than Tun and many of his comrades, relying on the protection of the Burmese people, avoided the search by the police during the city-wide terror curfew on the 28th and safely reached the liberated areas of central Burma. Frustrated by its failure, the Nu government made a hysterical roar and "declared war on the Communist Party" on the 30th, vainly attempting to "remove the Communist Party from the political stage." It also made excuses, saying that "the Communist Party already has a mature plan to launch an armed rebellion in Burma" (Agence France-Presse). At the same time, the strike of Rangoon workers continues, and transportation also remains at a standstill.

　　缅共领袖抨击反动政府
  　仰光工人群众联合示威
    反动当局竟实行法西斯恐怖镇压
    【新华社陕北三十日电】仰光讯：全缅职工会二十七日在此间举行会议，会上缅共领袖德钦丹东曾发表演说，呼吁工人大众团结起来，争取缅甸的民主化和建立完全代表人民的政府。德钦丹东对自由同盟右派领袖们协助外国帝国主义及本国大资本家继续巩固其在缅权势的政策，予以猛烈抨击。他说：政府正在压迫缅甸人民，而为帝国主义与买办资产阶级服务。会后，与会代表并与仰光的工人群众联合举行示威游行。又：缅甸石油公司工人于二十七日举行罢工，缅当局于二十八日慌忙宣布在该石油公司与电力站一带地区实行二十四小时戒严。
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】仰光讯：缅甸的民主与反动之间的斗争，日趋激烈。仰光四大外资（主要是英资）经营的公司，包括缅甸石油公司在内，已因工人坚持数日的罢工，陷于停顿。缅甸其他各地亦纷纷传来群众“骚乱”的消息。此种形势，使听命于外国帝国主义的缅甸反动当局坐卧不安，急图以法西斯恐怖实行镇压。二十八日黎明前，警察在仰光全市实行拘捕，企图摧毁缅甸人民民主运动的领导机关——缅共总部。当天“仰光通达内地的公路均被阻塞，警察监视铁路与水路，紧张空气笼罩全市。市场及商店停闭歇业，礼拜堂教徒们匆匆返家，没有参加惯常举行的复活节（按即三月二十八日）大典。新闻亦被管制”（合众社），缅共及其他民主报纸亦遭非法封闭。但当局以此种恐怖恫吓缅甸人民的企图，显未达到其预谋的目的，罢工仍在坚持中。
    【新华社陕北一日电】仰光讯：缅甸反动当局奉外国帝国主义之命，于二十八日搜捕缅共领袖德钦丹东的企图，已完全失败。据悉：德钦丹东及其许多同志，在当局二十八日全市恐怖戒严中，依靠缅甸人民的掩护，避开了警宪的搜索，而安全到达缅甸中部解放区。德钦努政府失败之余，乃作歇斯底里嘶鸣，于三十日“与共产党宣战”，妄图“排除共产党于政治舞台之外”。并故作借口，说“共产党已有一个成熟的在缅甸发动武装暴动的计划”（法新社）。与此同时，仰光工人的罢工，仍在坚持，交通亦继续停顿中。
