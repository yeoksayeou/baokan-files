Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th—Reports from various sources indicate that while actively engaging in military aggression against South China, American imperialism is intensifying its economic aggression. Among the key points of the plan determined by Stuart's visit to South China this month, the economic aggression component aims to build a South China (including Taiwan) economy in the style of an American colony and subordinate it to the needs of American imperialism and the revival of Japan's war industry potential under its control. According to the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, a Chiang Kai-shek political and academic publication, on the 19th of this month, after Stuart's visit to Guangzhou, the bandit Song Ziwen formulated a so-called "dual-track" plan to "utilize American capital and Japanese 'talent' to develop Hainan Island." Furthermore, according to Song's disclosure on the 13th, the monopolistic "Hainan Construction Company," controlled by American capital and Japanese "advisors," is about to be officially established. It is reported that the company's business scope is all-encompassing, including the Tianjie and Shilu iron mines, the Hainan Steel Plant, the Yinggehai salt fields, the Yulin fishing base, and the sugar industry. The Tianjie iron mine has already resumed operation, and American fishing boats have begun operating in Qionghai. Hainan Island's iron ore is exclusively used to provide blood for Japan's military industry. According to a special dispatch from Tokyo by Chiang's Central News Agency on the 15th, "Japan's steel industry will rely on Hainan Island's iron ore in the coming years, as the iron ore is virtually the only source of raw materials needed by Japan's steel industry." According to Shanghai newspapers, American imperialism has decided to allocate $60 million from the $463 million in new aid-Chiang bills to build a transportation network in South China, placing it under American control, so that American imperialism's economic and military aggression bases in South China will be linked together. Of this amount, $30 million is specifically used to repair the Yuehan Railway, and the remainder is used to build the following railways: First, the Shaoguan-Ganzhou branch of the Yuehan Railway, from Shaoguan in Guangdong via Shixing and Nanxiong into Jiangxi Province, Ganzhou, Taihe, Ji'an, and finally Jingjiang, connecting with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, with a total length of 260 kilometers. After the completion of this line, the southeastern half of the Chiang bandits' rule, as well as the southwestern border, will be connected into one piece; the main purpose is to sell all the tungsten sand in southern Jiangxi to Washington through this railway. Others include the Shantou-Xiamen line, which is more than 600 kilometers long, and the Guangzhou-Macau branch line. In addition to purchasing most of the equipment needed to build the above-mentioned railways from the United States with loans, it is also planned to allocate $4 million from the loan to set up a machinery factory in Xicun, Guangzhou, and a repair shop in Hengyang. The United States will invest in and control various industries and mines in South China. American imperialism has decided to jointly operate the Yuebei Gouyadong and Hunan Zhuzhou coal mines with Chiang's Resource Committee. The Xiangjiang Hydropower Plant near Guangzhou has been jointly built by American imperialism and Chiang's bandits, and American engineer Kordon has also negotiated with the Chiang side in Gutianxi, Fujian, and a hydropower plant will be built soon. The only aluminum plant in China, the Kaohsiung Aluminum Plant in Taiwan, was officially approved by the Chiang bandits' Executive Yuan "Political Affairs Conference" on the 11th of last month to be controlled by the American aluminum magnate Reynolds to meet the needs of the American military industry; and the Zhangpu aluminum mine in Fujian, which has a reserve of 300,000 tons, will also be jointly exploited by the United States and Chiang bandits to supply the Kaohsiung Aluminum Plant. According to a Fuzhou dispatch from Chiang's Central News Agency on the 22nd of this month, the Kaohsiung Aluminum Plant has sent engineers to Fujian to plan the mining work. The exploitation of strategic materials such as antimony and tungsten, which are abundant in South China, is now actively underway.

    【新华社陕北廿八日电】据各方报导：美帝与积极进行对华南军事侵略同时，正加紧推进对华南的经济侵略。本月中司徒雷登访问华南结果所确定的计划中，其经济侵略部分的要点，即为建设美国殖民地式的华南（包括台湾）经济，并使其服从于美帝及其控制下日本战争工业潜力复兴的需要。据本月十九日蒋党政学系香港大公报披露，司徒访穗后，宋匪子文已制订一所谓“利用美国资金与日本‘人材’开发海南岛的‘双管齐下’的方案。”另据宋匪十三日宣露，在美国资本及日本“顾问”控制下开发海南岛的垄断公司“海南建设公司”即将正式成立。据悉：该公司经营范围无所不包，其中有田獬、石禄两铁矿、海南炼钢厂、莺哥海盐田、榆林捕鱼基地及糖业等单位，田獬铁矿业已复工，美帝渔船已开始在琼海活动。海南岛铁矿则专用以为日本军需工业输血，据蒋匪中央社十五日东京专电称：“日本钢铁工业在未来数年中，将有赖于海南岛之铁矿，因该铁矿实际上已为日本钢铁工业所需原料之唯一来源。”另据沪报消息：美帝已决定自四亿六千三百万援蒋新法案中，拨出六千万美元作为修建华南交通网之用，将其置于美国控制之下，使美帝在华南之经济军事侵略基地联成一片。其中三千万美元专用以修整粤汉铁路，余则用以修筑以下各铁路线：第一为粤汉路韶赣支线，由广东之韶关经始兴、南雄入江西境赣县、泰和、吉安以迄靖江，与浙赣路相接，全长二百六十公里，此线完成后，蒋匪统治下之东南半壁以迄西南边沿将联成一片；而最主要目的，厥为将赣南之钨砂经此铁路全部拍卖给华盛顿。其他尚有汕头至厦门全长六百余公里之汕厦线，以及由广州至澳门之广澳支线。为修建上述各铁路所需器材，除大部分系以贷款拨用部分向美国购卖外，并准备另自贷款中拨出四百万美元在广州西村设一机械厂，在衡阳建一修车厂。美国对华南各工矿业均将投资控制。美帝已决定与蒋匪资源委员会合办粤北狗牙洞及湖南株州两大煤矿。广州附近之湘江水电厂已由美帝与蒋匪联合兴筑，福建古田溪地方亦已由美国工程师柯登与蒋方商妥，即将兴办水力发电厂。中国仅有之台湾高雄铝厂，上月十一日蒋匪行政院“政务会议”已正式通过由美国铝业大王雷诺投资控制，以应美国军事工业需要；而蕴藏量共达三十万吨的福建漳浦铝矿，最近亦将由美蒋共同开掘，借以供应高雄铝厂。据蒋匪中央社本月廿二日福州电称：高雄铝厂已派工程师到闽，筹划开采工作。至华南盛产之战略物资如锑、钨等的开掘，现均积极进行。
