　　Mengcun, under the Relief Leadership of the Democratic Government,
  　Overcomes Chiang's Disaster and Resumes Production
    [Xiuwu News] In the first, second, and third districts, last month, the villages were brutally robbed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and every household was emptied. In Mengcun, with forty-two households, not even a bucket or a plow could be found. The masses went out crying and returned to the mountains, their morale very low, and there was no talk of production. Recently, our democratic government staff went to the villages to call on the masses to return home, living with them and sharing their hardships. Six liang of millet per day are saved to provide relief to the disaster victims, and 1,240 jin of grain were lent out (ten jin for large mouths and five jin for small mouths), along with four pots and thirty-six bowls. Combining this with factual propaganda, it was explained that this was Chiang Kai-shek's death throes, and only by immediately resuming production could we overcome the disaster. Social mutual aid was also carried out, promoting the spirit that all farmers are one family. The masses in Wuliyuan lent Mengcun three shi and two dou of corn seeds, and mobilized each household to use various relationships to borrow grain from relatives and friends who had not been affected by the disaster. Through government relief and social mutual aid, the masses' food problem was gradually resolved, and they immediately organized production. The first difficulty encountered was the lack of farm tools. After discussion, the mutual aid teams borrowed plows from various villages through private relationships, and six mutual aid teams have now borrowed five plows. The government distributed 200 jin of cotton seeds, and the masses began planting cotton. This administrative village has a total of sixty-one households and one hundred and ninety-four people, and more than one hundred and forty mu of cotton have now been planted. Taking the joint defense as a unit, carpenters and blacksmith shops were organized to make farm tools; the bank issued loans, and Mengcun borrowed 200,000 yuan, which was first reported by each household, and then democratically assessed, and lent to more than forty poor and middle peasant households in difficulty. The masses established two families, front and rear, with the old and weak settling in the rear, and the able-bodied young men and women returning to the village to cultivate the land, and transferring to the rear when there was a situation. The militia self-defense team stood guard in the village at night, persisted on the spot, and there was a clear division of labor between the front and rear. Under the cover of the joint defense militia, the masses of the whole village are actively planting sesame. In another twenty days or so, the rapeseed will be ripe, and the masses' living difficulties can be relieved. The masses said: "When the wheat comes down in May, we will still have good times. The prostitute Chiang Kai-shek robbed us of food, but it can't save his life." Recently, three more people returned to the village from Chiang's occupied area, saying that the enemy in the city and Jiaozuo were very panicked and afraid that we would attack them. The masses happily said: "Finish planting sesame as soon as possible and prepare to cooperate with the army in fighting!" (Lian Qiangguo, Xiuwu Joint Office)

    【修武消息】一、二、三区上月遭蒋匪残暴抢劫，家家户户被抢一空，四十二户的孟村，连一只水桶、一张犁也找不到。群众哭着走出门，返上山去，情绪非常低落，更谈不到生产了。近日我民主政府工作人员到各村号召群众返家，自己和群众生活在一起，共渡甘苦。每日省小米六两，救济灾民，放借粮一千二百四十斤（大口十斤小口五斤），锅四口，碗卅六个，结合事实进行宣传，说明这是蒋匪死亡前的挣扎，只有咱们立即生产，才能渡过大灾。又进行社会互济，发扬天下农民是一家的精神。五里源群众借给孟村玉茭籽三石二斗，又发动各户利用各种关系到未受灾的亲友家借粮。经过政府救济和社会互济，群众吃食问题逐渐解决，便立即组织生产，首先碰到的困难是没农具。经大家讨论，以互助组为单位，利用私人关系分头到各村借犁，六个互助组现已借回五张。政府发放棉籽二百斤，群众开始种棉。这一行政村共六十一户，一百九十四口人，现已下种棉花一百四十余亩。以联防为单位，组织木匠、铁匠铺打制农具；银行发放贷款，孟村贷了二十万，首由各户自报，后经民主评议，贷给四十多户贫农、中农困难户。群众建立了前后方两个家庭，老弱在后面安家，能劳动的青年男女回村种地，有情况再向后方转移。民兵自卫队夜间在村中站岗放哨，就地坚持，前后方都有明确分工。在联防民兵队掩护下，全村群众正积极种芝麻。再有二十多天油菜成熟，群众生活困难即可解除。群众说：“五月麦下来，咱还是好时光。娼子蒋介石抢走咱粮食，也救不了他的命。”该村近日从蒋占区又返回群众三人，说城里、焦作，敌人都很恐慌，害怕咱们去打他。群众欢喜的说：“快将芝麻早些种完，准备配合军队打仗！”（修武联合办公室连强国）
