Communications and Exchanges (No. 25)
To all correspondents, production work teams, and land reform work groups across various regions:

Now that spring plowing has begun, reports from various regions regarding production issues are still relatively sparse. Please quickly prioritize organizing reports on the following questions:

    I. In areas where land reform is underway, how to closely integrate land reform with production to ensure that spring plowing is not delayed.

    II. In areas where land reform is not yet underway, what effective measures are being taken to clarify the confused thinking of cadres and the masses, and to resolve the leadership issues in production.

    III. How are disaster victims in the spring famine being relieved, and how are their production difficulties being resolved?

    IV. How to organize mutual aid groups under the principle of uniting middle peasants and voluntary mutual assistance, and how to solve the various difficulties in livestock, farm implements, and seeds for poor and hired peasants during production.

Shahe Production Work Team, Xingtai and Shexian Production Inspection Teams: Please continue to report on your achievements and experiences in organizing the masses to engage in production to overcome the famine.

　　通讯往来　（第二十五号）各地通讯员，生产工作队，土改工作组：
    现春耕开始，各地对生产问题的报导，还比较稀松。请将下列问题，赶快抓紧组织报导：
    一、正在进行土改的地区，如何使土改生产紧密结合，做到不耽误春耕。
    二、没有进行土改的地区，采取什么有效办法澄清干部与群众中的混乱思想，解决生产的领导问题。
    三、春荒中的灾民如何救济，并如何解决其生产困难。
    四、如何在团结中农，自愿互助的原则下，组织互助组，又如何解决贫雇生产中的牲畜、农具、种籽等种种的困难。
    沙河生产工作队，邢台、涉县生产检查队：请将你们组织群众生产渡荒的成绩经验，继续报导。
