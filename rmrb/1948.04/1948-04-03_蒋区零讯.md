Chiang Kai-shek Area News Snippets

　　▲Shanghai News: The once magnificent "International Ballroom" has recently been forced to convert into the "Happy Star Brothel," and the "Small Metropolitan Ballroom" is also preparing to operate as a brothel. After Chiang Kai-shek's bandit authorities "strictly banned" ballrooms, they refused to provide the dancers and ballroom staff with legitimate employment, forcing the dancers into prostitution.
　　▲Shanghai newspaper reports: Amidst soaring prices, the existing number of columns on abacuses is no longer sufficient, and must be increased to at least seventeen to twenty-one. And bank drafts from commercial firms, amounting to 20 or 30 billion yuan per piece, are no longer unusual; generally, the unit is now in the billions. Chiang Kai-shek's "Banking Association" has recently advocated using the word "trillion."
　　▲In Shanghai at the end of last month, deep-fried dough sticks and sesame cakes had already risen to at least 5,000 yuan per piece, and small daily necessities can no longer be measured in units of thousands.
　　▲In Pingzhen, Tiantai County, Zhejiang Province, a certain paper store recently bought a large number of unusable one-yuan banknotes from the bank, stamped them with "Republic Bank 100 Yuan" and sold each one for 100 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek's currency, making a profit of a hundred times.

　　蒋区零讯
    ▲沪讯：昔日富丽堂皇之“国际舞厅”近已被迫改为“乐星妓院”，“小都会舞厅”亦正准备改营妓院。蒋匪当局于“严厉取缔”舞厅后，拒给舞女及舞厅职工以正当职业，强迫舞女为妓。
    ▲沪报载：物价猛涨中，原有算盘档数已不敷应用，起码改成十七至二十一档。而行庄支票，数达二、三十亿元一纸者已不足为奇，一般已以亿为单位。蒋匪“银行学会”近已主张使用“兆”字。
    ▲沪市上月底大饼油条已涨至每件起码五千元，零星日用物品千字已不成单位。
    ▲浙江天台县平镇某纸店，近向银行买来大量不能通行的一元钞票，盖上“冥国银行一百元”字样印戳，每张售蒋币一百元，利市百倍。
