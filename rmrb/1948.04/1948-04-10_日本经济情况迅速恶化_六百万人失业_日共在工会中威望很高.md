　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. TASS reports: A Labour newspaper observer commented on the Japanese labour movement on the 3rd, stating: The lives of Japanese workers and civil servants continue to deteriorate after the war. Rampant inflation and the ensuing price increases have placed a heavy burden on the working people. Prices have increased almost seventy times compared to pre-war levels, while wages have only increased about six times. Today, the number of unemployed in Japan has reached over six million. The Ashida government, like its predecessors, stubbornly ignores the needs of the working people. Japanese and American employers are equally concerned with maintaining Japan's low wages and colonial-style labour exploitation. Japanese workers have launched strikes demanding wage increases, fiercely opposing the Ashida government's refusal to meet the reasonable demands of Japanese workers. The commentary continues: Despite the US military authorities' policy of prohibiting strikes, the Japanese working people are different from before the war; they have gained much practical political struggle experience in the past two or three years. Today, Japanese trade unions have 6.2 million members, an increase of about 140 times compared to pre-war levels. The Communist Party enjoys high prestige in the trade unions. Twenty-five of the fifty members of the Executive Committee of the National Congress of Industrial Organizations (Sanbetsu) are Communists. In the nineteen-seat Executive Committee Presidium, the Communist Party holds eleven seats. Even in the right-wing-controlled Japanese Federation of Labour (Sodomei), many local branches are still headed by Communists. Regardless of all the insidious tactics of the American and Japanese reactionaries, the Communist Party's influence in the trade unions is growing. The Japanese working people's desire for trade union unity is very strong, and they enthusiastically respond to the Communist Party's call to establish a people's democratic front to fight against the reactionaries. Mass rallies of 80,000 people in Osaka and 30,000 people in Tokyo unanimously supported this proposal. The commentary concludes: The Japanese working class stands at the forefront of the rising people's democratic movement. This movement has united workers, peasants, and intellectuals. All suppression and prohibitions cannot stop the struggle of the working masses to fight for their vital interests and rights.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Tokyo reports: The Japanese Communist Party recently issued a statement, denouncing the Japanese reactionary parliament's lower house budget committee's passage of the temporary budget bill for April, stating: This bill is an extremely heavy burden on Japanese workers. The bill stipulates that a large amount of expenditure be used to protect the interests of employers, while only insignificant funds are used for economic recovery and public welfare. The taxes imposed on the working people are twenty times those levied on companies. (Note: This budget bill was approved by MacArthur Headquarters on the 1st, with a total amount of over 25 billion yen, of which only 600 million yen is used for education and only 300 million yen is used for post-disaster relief in flood-stricken areas.)

　　日本经济情况迅速恶化
    六百万人失业
  　日共在工会中威望很高
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社讯：苏劳动报观察家三日评论日本工运称：战后日本工人与机关公务员的生活，在继续恶化中。狂奔不已的通货膨胀及随之而来的物价高涨，在劳动人民肩上加上了沉重的负担。物价与战前水平比较，几乎增加了七十倍，而工资仅增加了六倍左右；今天日本失业人数已达六百万名以上。芦田政府和前届政府一样，顽固的忽视劳动人民的需要。日美雇主，对保留日本的低工资水平及殖民地式的劳动剥削均同等关切。日本工人已以发起要求增资的罢工斗争，猛烈反对拒绝答应日本工人合理要求的芦田政府。评论继称：尽管美军当局采取禁止罢工政策，但日本劳动人民已与战前不同，他们在过去两三年中已获得了许多实际政治斗争的经验。现在日本工会拥有六百二十万会员，比战前增加约一百四十倍，共产党在工会中享有很高的威望，在全国产业别组合协议会（产联）执委会五十名委员中，二十五名是共产党人。而在执委主席团十九席中，共产党占十一席，甚至在右派控制下的劳动总同盟（劳联）中，许多地方分会仍以共产党员为首。不顾美日反动派的一切阴险手法，共产党的势力在工会中日益增长，日本劳动人民希望工会团结的愿望非常强烈，他们热烈响应共产党提出建立人民民主阵线与反动派斗争的号召。大坂八万人的群众大会及东京三万人的群众大会，一致拥护这一建议。评论结语称：日本劳动阶级站在高涨中的人民民主运动的最前列。这一运动已将工人、农民和知识分子团结起来。一切镇压和禁令，都阻止不了劳苦大众争取切身利益和权利的斗争。
    【新华社陕北七日电】东京讯：日本共产党顷发表声明，指斥日本反动议会下院预算委员会通过之四月份临时预算法案称：这一法案对日本工人是极重的负担，该法案规定以大量开支用以保护雇主的利益，而仅以微不足道的款项，作复兴经济及公共福利之用，而加于劳动人民身上的捐税，则为课于公司者之二十倍。（按该预算法案系于一日经麦克阿瑟总部批准者，其总数为二百五十余亿日元，其中用于教育经费者只六亿日元，用于水灾区善后经费者只三亿日元。）
