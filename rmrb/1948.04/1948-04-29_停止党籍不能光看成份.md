    Stopping Party Membership Cannot Just Look at Class Background

    To the Editor:

    In this village, Li Zhichao's father had been a barber since he was a child, and his grandmother had worked as a cook for others. His elder brother also learned to be a barber at the age of fourteen. Later, his father and brother opened their own barbershop in the city. One of his uncles had separated from his grandfather's household but, having no son, rejoined the family, bringing with him nineteen mu of land. His parents were both diligent and thrifty, and the family's economic situation gradually improved. He started school at the age of nine and left at fifteen, staying home to endure hardship. At that time, his family owned more than sixty mu of land and had a family of eight. He and his uncle worked hard at home, regularly raising livestock and hiring a farmhand for a total of six years. After the Incident [likely referring to a local conflict during the civil war], three members of his family died within three months, and he married a wife. From then on, the family's economic situation declined, and the farmhand was dismissed. Now, the family has no livestock, five people, and thirty mu of land (including eighteen mu of alkaline land), six tile-roofed houses, and four flat-roofed houses. The family has very few production tools. Zhichao joined the village work in 1945 and joined the Party in October. According to the principles of this Party rectification, based on his exploitation, he was deemed a rich peasant and his Party membership was suspended. Li Zhichao later said to us: "You suspended my Party membership based on my class background, which I am unhappy about. Although my family used to exploit by hiring farmhands, my family, as barbers in the old society, suffered the most from the oppression of the ruling class. We had no political status, and people looked down on us, saying our family was lowly because we were barbers. Joining the Party, I knew that the Communist Party was liberating those who had been oppressed in the past, and I thought that everyone could be equal in the future. Who knew that today I would have no right to speak? I can't figure it out." We are unclear about how to handle this issue. Should he be considered a rich peasant? What attitude should be taken towards his Party membership issue? We would appreciate your explanation.

    To the Comrades of the Weixian Fourth District, Balizhuang Work Group:

    Although Li Zhichao's family employed a farmhand for six years in the past, they stopped employing farmhands three years after the Incident due to the decline of the family's economy, and their main production relied on their own labor. According to the class designation regulations, a rich peasant who has ceased exploitation for three years should have their class status and treatment changed according to their changed circumstances. Li Zhichao's class status should have been changed long ago. It is wrong for you to still treat him as a rich peasant today and suspend his Party membership. In addition, it is worth clearly stating that in the Party rectification, the focus should be on the member's performance, and not simply on their class background, that is, to stop the Party membership of all those who were rich peasants. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in its instructions on land reform and Party rectification in the old and semi-old areas, pointed out: "For those intellectuals or other members within the Party who, although from exploiting classes, voluntarily renounce their original class stance, if they have committed serious mistakes but have not yet lost the minimum qualifications as a Party member, as long as they admit their mistakes, are willing to correct their mistakes, and gain the consent of the masses outside the Party, we should adopt an attitude of observation and education, and not immediately expel them from the Party. For Party members who have committed minor mistakes, regardless of their origin, an educational approach should be adopted." You did not consider other conditions and only said that a comrade's family had exploited in the past and suspended their Party membership, which is not cautious enough.

### 停止党籍不能光看成份

专栏：编读往来

    停止党籍不能光看成份编辑同志：
    这村李智超，他父亲自小学剃头，他祖母曾给人家当过作饭的。他哥哥十四岁也学剃头，后来他父亲与他哥哥在城内就自己开剃头铺。他一个伯父是从他祖父时分的家，因没儿子又给他和了家，带着十九亩地，他父母都很勤俭，从此家里经济逐渐上升。他九岁上学，到十五岁下学，就在家受苦。当时他家有六十多亩地，八口人，他与伯父在家受苦，经常喂一个牲口，雇一个雇工，共用雇工六年。事变后三年他家三个月内连死了三口人，娶了一个媳妇，从此家中经济下降，雇工也解除了。现在家里没喂牲口，人五口，共地三十亩（内有十八亩碱地），瓦房六间，平房四间，家中生产工具很少。智超民国三十四年参加本村工作，十月参加党。根据这次整党原则，根据他的剥削，认为他是富农，停止了他的党籍。李智超后来给我们说：你们根据我的成份停止我的党籍，我心中不愿意，虽我家过去有雇工剥削，但我家剃头在过去旧社会的时候最受统治压迫，政治上没有地位，人家看不起，说我家剃头低下，参加党知道共产党是解放过去受压迫的人，我认为以后可人人平等了，谁知今天我又没有说话的权力了，我心里想不通。关于这个问题我们研究不清，该怎样对待，是否他算富农呢？对他的党籍问题应该采取什么态度？请你们给解释一下是荷。          （魏县四区八里庄工作组）魏县四区八里庄工作组同志：
    李智超家庭虽然在过去用过六年长工，但在事变后三年因家庭经济下降，就不再用长工，主要生产靠自己劳动。按划阶级规定富农停止剥削满三年，即应依其转变后的情况，改变其成份及待遇。李智超的成份早就应该改变，今天你们仍以富农对待他，停止他的党籍是不对的。另外，值得明确提出的：在整党中，应根据党员的表现，而不能单纯看党员成份，是富农就一律停止党籍。中共中央在老区半老区进行土地改革工作与整党工作的指示中，曾指出：“对于那些虽然是从剥削阶级出身，但是自愿放弃其原来的阶级立场的党内知识分子或其他分子，在他们犯有严重错误，但尚未丧失当作一个党员的起码资格的时候，只要他们承认错误，愿意改正错误，并获得党外群众同意，我们就应采取考察和教育的态度，而不要马上开除出党。对于那些犯有较轻错误的党员，不论其出身如何，均应采取教育方针。”你们没有根据其他条件，只说一个同志过去家庭有过剥削就停止党籍是不够慎重的。
