Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the suffering of national industry and commerce in various Chiang-controlled areas has further deepened around the time of the Lunar New Year. According to incomplete materials published in newspapers and telegrams: In the major industrial and commercial cities of the North China Chiang-controlled area, Beijing and Tianjin, only 20% of factories are operating, and even those are only operating for half a day. In Tianjin, even the relatively stable rubber industry, out of 54 factories, more than ten had already closed down before the New Year, and the output of the remaining factories that were barely operating had been reduced to one-tenth of what it was two years ago. In Beijing, 27% of businesses have been unable to continue operating. In Qingdao, out of a total of 1,500 factories of all sizes, 1,200 have closed down, including all of the more than 700 larger factories that used electricity. In Kaifeng, more than 500 businesses have also closed down. In Shenyang, out of more than 3,000 registered businesses, 2,000 have closed down. In Zhangjiakou, only one-tenth of the large factories are operating; and one-tenth of the city's more than 3,000 businesses have been unable to continue operating. In Guangzhou, the industrial and commercial center of South China, 30% of businesses are facing the crisis of closure. In Jiangxi, 93 factories have closed down.

The criminal rule of the Chiang Kai-shek fascist bandit gang is the cause of and exacerbates the industrial and commercial crisis in various Chiang-controlled areas. At the beginning of this year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities increased various taxes, with general tax rates increasing by 50% to several hundred percent. Cigarette factories in Chongqing, for example, faced the crisis of bankruptcy due to a threefold increase in taxes. In Tianjin, out of the original 300 restaurants, more than 100 had already closed down at the beginning of the year due to unbearable losses. Subsequently, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities added a "banquet tax" that was twice as high. According to this tax rate, even a small restaurant selling 25 buns would have to pay 20,000 yuan in taxes, making it impossible for even those restaurants that were barely operating to continue. In Xuzhou, after the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities increased the business tax fourfold, hundreds of businesses closed down because they could not bear the burden. Even the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, which belongs to the Chiang Party, government, and academic circles, admitted: "The burden on the industrial sector, including the commercial sector, is heavy, and this burden is constantly increasing. For example, a factory or bank has to donate tens of millions of yuan every month."

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's open robbery and plunder has dealt a fatal blow to private industry and commerce. Just as the Lunar New Year was approaching, when businesses generally needed funds, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities suddenly announced the suspension of "loans" and restrictions on remittances, causing factories and businesses in various places to close down one after another. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities then announced the low-price "acquisition of finished products" in order to plunder the products of private factories. Most manufacturers in Tianjin at the time believed that this "selling blood" acquisition method was tantamount to forcing manufacturers to "sign a contract on New Year's Eve." Some factories, in order to survive, were forced to flee to Hong Kong. According to reports in Tianjin newspapers, after the Lunar New Year, 50 yarn factories and hardware product factories in Shanghai had already fled to Hong Kong. Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities announced the so-called "order loans" and "entrusted production" and other "loan policies" for openly and comprehensively plundering private production enterprises, as well as the hypocritical "measures to ban hoarding and speculation," forcing private industry and commerce into a deeper crisis.

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's increasingly intensified monopoly control also directly threatens the survival of private industry and commerce. Taking coal as an example, all fuel in the Chiang-controlled areas is "controlled" by the "Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs," which is divided up by the four major families and their lackey, the Youth Party. Before the New Year, Shanghai suffered a severe coal shortage, which seriously affected the production of private factories, and many factories were forced to suspend operations and reduce production. However, the committee hoarded as much as 200,000 tons of coal in Shanghai.

　　蒋匪帮公开掠夺民营工商业
  　青岛工厂几全部倒闭
  　平津沈汴等地歇业者增多
    【新华社陕北十日电】综合报导：旧历年关前后，蒋区各地民族工商业苦难已进一步加深。据报刊电讯发表不完全材料：华北蒋区工商首埠平津两市，开工工厂仅有百分之二十，且均只开工半天。津市即一向较能维持的橡胶业，五十四家工厂中除十余家于年前停业外，其他勉强开业之各厂产量亦均已缩减至两年前的十分之一。北平各业商号已有百分之二十七无法继续营业。青岛共有大小工厂一千五百家，倒闭歇业者达一千二百家，其中使用电力的较大工厂七百余家竟全部停业。开封各业商号亦有五百余家倒闭。沈阳全市登记的商号共三千余家，倒闭达二千家之多。张垣大型工厂开工的仅十分之一；全市三千余家商号亦有十分之一无法继续营业。华南工商业中心广州，全市各业商号有百分之三十面临倒闭危机。江西各业工厂倒闭达九十三家。
    蒋家法西斯匪帮的罪恶统治，是造成及加深蒋区各地工商业危机的原因。今年年初蒋匪当局加征各项捐税，一般增加税率达百分之五十至数百不等，重庆各卷烟厂即因一次增税三倍，而面临破产危机。津市原有饭馆业三百余家，年初即有百余家因不堪亏蚀而倒闭，随后蒋匪当局又加征“筵席捐”两倍，按照该税率连小饭馆卖二十五个包子亦须缴捐两万元，致勉强开业之饭馆亦已无法维持。徐州蒋匪当局增收营业税四倍后，即有数百家商号因不堪负担而倒闭。连蒋党政学系之津大公报亦供认：“工业界，连商业界在内，负担是沉重的，而且这付负担还刻刻在增加，譬如一工厂或银行，每月动辄要捐几千万元”。
    蒋匪帮的公开强盗掠夺，给予民营工商业致命打击。正当迫近新历年关，一般工商业亟需资金之时，蒋匪当局突然宣布停止“贷款”及限制汇兑，各地工厂商号纷纷停业倒闭，蒋匪当局继即宣布低价“收购成品”，以达掠夺民营工厂产品的目的。津市大多数厂家当时均认为：这种“卖血”一样的收购办法，无异强迫厂商在“大年三十成契”。一部分工厂为求生存，则被迫纷纷逃港。据津报披露，旧历年后，沪市纱厂、五金制品厂有五十家工厂业已逃港。最近蒋匪当局又宣布公开全面掠夺民间生产事业之所谓“定货贷款”、“委托产制”等“贷款方针”，及做贼喊贼之“取缔囤积居奇办法”，迫使民营工商业陷于更深重危机。
    蒋匪帮变本加厉的垄断统制，亦直接威胁民营工商业的生存。以燃煤为例，蒋区全部燃料均为四大家族及其奴仆青年党参与分肥之“经济部燃料委员会”所“管制”，年前沪市严重煤荒，民营工厂生产遭受深重影响，且有不少工厂被迫停工歇业及减产，而该会竟在沪囤积燃煤达二十万吨之巨。
