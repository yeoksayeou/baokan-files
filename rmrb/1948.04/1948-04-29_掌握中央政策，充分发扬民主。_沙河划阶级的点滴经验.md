Grasping Central Policies, Fully Promoting Democracy – Some Experiences from Class Division in Shahe

A veteran of Shahe Xincheng said, "Class division is just like grinding wheat into flour. Using a sieve, the flour is flour, and the bran is bran, separated clearly." Class division not only clarifies the class composition of the entire village but also greatly enhances the class consciousness of the masses. Due to the importance of this work, it is indeed not easy to do well. The Shahe Land Reform Work Team has divided classes in most of the villages they have reached. Here are some experiences for study and reference:

(1) Firmly grasp the central government's stipulated standards for class division and do not arbitrarily elevate or lower classifications.

In the past, there were significant problems with class division, with a common issue being the elevation of status and expansion of the scope of struggle. Shahe had four errors in past class divisions: (1) Using political views to divide classes, such as local bullies, secret agents, puppet soldiers, puppet village chiefs, henchmen, etc., resulting in the wrongful struggle against many middle and poor peasants who should not have been targeted. (2) Using lifestyle views, such as hoodlums, vagrants, sharp operators, loose women, bandits, petty thieves, etc., also leading to the wrongful struggle against many people. (3) Subjective "struggle the rich" viewpoint: focusing solely on who had the most possessions without considering exploitation, resulting in the wrongful struggle against many prosperous middle peasants. (4) Forcibly piecing things together: tracing ancestry back three generations, sometimes even to the Ming Dynasty, labeling people as "transformed households" or "destitute households," causing people who had long transformed into laborers to be wrongfully struggled against.

In short, this was all non-class-based division, resulting in the expansion of the enemy, fear among middle peasants, and a chaotic situation. This is the lesson we learned from lacking a clear class viewpoint and not grasping the central government's standards for class division.

The favorable conditions for this class division are: after rectification and study, cadres have a clearer class viewpoint than before, and the principles of class division can generally be grasped. However, specific issues are still difficult. Due to the complexity of the class division documents, coupled with the illiteracy or limited literacy of cadres, it is difficult to remember everything. This illustrates the importance of the work team studying the documents. In Shahe, in addition to collective study before going to the countryside, training was also conducted for team leaders to learn division (each county party committee trained two teams) and conduct trial divisions in conjunction with the movement. For households that were unclear during the division, collective study was conducted to resolve them using the spirit of the documents. Secondly, before class division, class propaganda and class education were carried out, and past erroneous division methods were criticized during the propaganda. More importantly, training was provided to key activists for class division, so they could carry out propaganda and master the principles. This was done better in Baicuo and Xincheng, but some villages lacked this, leading to greater problems in the work. In addition, timely guidance from leaders is also crucial. Some comrades mistakenly believe that this is "paternalism," which is incorrect. Problems that arose during the division: (1) Dividing based on personality, such as "hoodlums" and "secret agents." Shangguan Village even had "poor local bullies." (2) Simply comparing possessions, especially prone to errors when comparing at large meetings. The main way to solve problems is through self-reporting and public discussion in small groups. During the division, there was often talk of exchanging property with each other. (3) Elevating status, mainly for those above prosperous middle peasants. Some proposed that those with too much vacant land, those who planted labor-saving crops without hiring labor, or those who abandoned land were engaging in exploitation, which is wrong. (4) Lowering status (households below middle peasant): everyone thought being poor was glorious and didn't want to be labeled "middle," or incorrectly thought that being classified as a poor peasant would mean getting more stuff. If the leadership does not provide necessary corrections and education in these issues, problems will arise. Sometimes, when the masses don't understand or are unclear on disputed issues, they ask for your guidance. If the leadership is permissive at this time, it becomes a tailist following without leadership. Xin Zhang and Bai Cuo focused on minor issues, comparing possessions and exchanging property when dividing middle peasants, which was not good. After the leaders provided guidance, the masses said, "We mainly look at exploitation. If the land, house, and furniture are about the same, that's good enough. Ten fingers can't be the same length." Only then could the work proceed.

(2) Use the method of self-reporting, public discussion, and three postings for final decision, fully promoting democracy; individual class status should be determined.

To ensure that class status is determined correctly, it is necessary to use the method of self-reporting, public discussion, and three postings for final decision, fully promoting democracy, and giving the leadership leeway in terms of time to consider issues. According to the situation in most villages, the first posting is often problematic because the masses lack experience in division and some are unwilling to break through face-saving (especially middle peasants), leading to perfunctory passage. Class division is not yet at its peak at this time. The second posting can be very different from the first. Additionally, with the division of individual class status, the masses discuss and chat, men and women, old and young, are all considering the status of each household. This is the peak period of class division, and many problems are resolved at this time. The vast majority of households can be correctly determined (but not yet finalized). The third posting is finalized after the establishment of the peasant representative conference. Before finalization, the main task is to resolve remaining issues, but they may not be completely cleared up. There may be individual households that are still unclear, or the individuals insist on their opinions. Households that have been clarified and those that the individual has no opinion on, after review and approval by the peasant representative conference, are finalized and announced in the third posting. Finalization cannot be done without the establishment of a peasant representative conference or without its approval, as it is the highest authority in the countryside and can also enhance its leadership prestige. (Note: According to the central government's class division documents, the third posting should be discussed and approved by the entire village's villagers' meeting one by one – Editor). Secondly, it should be noted that many cadres simply see the three postings for final decision as a mere formality and do not understand why there are three postings, what their role is, and what their spirit is. Therefore, in class division, the three postings for final decision are treated as a formality, as in villages like Xia Zheng, resulting in the masses becoming uninterested and annoyed. Among the masses, there is also a theory of "discussing it over and over," thinking that once it has been discussed three times, everything will be fine. Some villages, in the division, did not proceed according to the actual situation or from the demands of the masses. Most have already been publicly discussed, but because a few are unclear or not at home, they have to wait until everyone is present, making the masses impatient. Villages like Wanggang and Baicuo did well, not failing to announce each posting because a few are unclear. Households that have no objections from the individual and the masses after the first posting do not necessarily have to be passed one by one again. Only those that are not yet divided, not yet clarified, or have objections are investigated and discussed to clarify. When the postings are released, they are still written together. When the peasant representative conference finalizes the decision, it must review each household in detail and absorb the reflections of the masses at ordinary times. Incorrect ones must be revised.

To ensure that everyone is not wronged in determining status and to truly promote democracy, individual class status must be determined. The focus of the division is on those who are oppressed in landlord and rich peasant families and on the relations of adoption, child selling, adoption of children, taking wives, and all those who maintain their livelihoods by independent labor (doctors, staff, handicraft workers, etc.). (It is not necessary to divide everyone. Most people have the same status as their family members.)

Our leadership only has the obligation to speak, explain, and provide guidance but does not have the right to determine status. Every status must be decided by the masses. Those who insist on their individual opinions should be firmly retained. We must never suppress their individual opinions using the "minority submits to the majority" method. Even if individual households want to sue to the People's Court for judgment, we also welcome them. It is also important to express attitudes at any time during the process to prevent the masses from daring to break through all ideological concerns. Only in this way can we ensure that no one is wronged. Fourth, it is necessary to mobilize poor and hired peasants to connect with middle peasants in order to divide class status well. Consolidating the unity of middle peasants is certain. However, some shortcomings of middle peasants are also worth noting. In class division, middle peasants generally have more face-saving. The groups with the most middle peasants are the most likely to lower status and pass things over vaguely, sometimes showing a tendency to follow the wind. Therefore, without honest poor and hired peasants who say what they have to say as the backbone, status will certainly not be divided well. (Note: It must also be noted that relying solely on poor and hired peasants will also lead to errors, easily elevating status. Therefore, it is also necessary to fully mobilize middle peasants in class division and to let landlords, rich peasants, and everyone know the standards of class division and dare to defend themselves. – Editor)

(3) Grasp the demands of the masses and combine with current production:

Currently, the masses are busy with the intense spring plowing and sowing campaign. Even more problematic is that many villages suffered from drought, wind, hail, and other disasters last year, and many households are facing food shortages. Their current urgent demand is to solve the food problem. If we do not combine with production, we will be at odds with the demands of the masses. Due to the complexity of class division, meetings are required, but we must try to reduce daytime meetings, not make them too long, and still do the work well. This requires us to use our brains to think about problems, prepare fully before meetings, clarify the focus of the meetings, and plan well in terms of organization and work steps. Shangguan Village failed to hold its first women's meeting on class division due to insufficient preparation. After the meeting, they calculated the accounts and found that they had earned over 200 catties of rice less from spinning and weaving. After self-criticism, they promptly corrected it. First, they educated the backbone, and after they understood how to divide classes, they connected with each other. The second time they held a women's meeting of more than 30 people, it was short and very successful. (Compiled by Wang Xing)

    掌握中央政策，充分发扬民主。
    ——沙河划阶级的点滴经验
    沙河新城一个老汉说：“划阶级就跟咱磨麦子面一样，拿箩筛，面是面，麸是麸，分得一清二格。”划阶级不只是澄清全村的阶级面貌，更能使群众阶级觉悟大大的提高一步。由于这一工作的重要，做起来的确是不容易的。沙河土改工作队到了的村子大都划了阶级，这里提出几点经验，供研究参考：
    （一）确实掌握中央规定的划阶级标准，不得随便升降。
    过去在划阶级上是出了很大毛病的，普遍的是提高成份，扩大斗争面。沙河过去划阶级的错误有四：（一）用政治观点划阶级，如霸恶、特务、伪军、伪保长、狗腿……等，所以把许多中贫农不应斗的斗了。（二）用生活观点划，如地痞、流氓、尖头、破鞋、土匪、小偷等，也斗错不少人。（三）主观的斗富观点：不看剥削只看谁圪堆大就斗谁，这样错斗了不少富裕中农。（四）强拉硬凑；划阶级追三代，有的追到明朝，又是“化形户”、“破落户”等，使早已转变成劳动者的人们都被错斗了。
    总之，一句话，这都是非阶级观点的划法，结果扩大了敌人，中农怕斗，造成混乱状态。这是由于我们缺乏明确的阶级观点，没有掌握中央划阶级的标准所给予我们的教训。
    这次划阶级给予我们的有利条件是：经过整编学习，干部的阶级观点较前明确，划阶级的原则，一般的也能掌握。但到了具体问题上，就更难了，由于划阶级文件的复杂，再加上干部不识字，或识字少，是很难全部记住的。这说明了工作组学习文件的重要。沙河除未下乡前集体学习外，结合运动，还训练组长学划（每个县委训练二个队）试划，在划中有搞不清的户，便集体研究，用文件上的精神解决之。其次在划阶级前，讲阶级宣传阶级，过去的错误的划法也要在宣传中批判。更重要的是训练划阶级骨干积极分子，由他们去宣传、掌握。这一点在白错、新城搞的较好，但有一部分村缺乏这一点，工作毛病就更大。另外领导上的及时拨灯，更为重要。有的同志把这认为是“包办”是错误的。划时出现的问题：（一）以人格划，如“流氓”“特务”，上关村划的有“穷恶霸”等。（二）单纯的论圪堆比圪堆，这特别在大会比时容易错定原则，解决问题主要的是在小组自报公议，划时往往会遇到相互换财产的说法。（三）提高成份，主要在富裕中农以上，有的提空粮地多、种省工庄稼不雇人或荒了地的都算剥削的主张是错误的。（四）降低成份（中农以下户）都以为穷光荣，不愿带“中”字，或认为划为贫农能多分东西等不正确思想而产生。以上的问题领导上如不随时给予必要的改正教育，便会出问题。有时群众不了解，或争论不明问题，他要求你指教，这时领导上如放任，便成了无领导的尾巴主义。新章、白错在划中农时抓小问题，比东西、换财产，很不好确定。领导拨灯后，群众说：“咱主要以剥削看，地房、家具差不多就行，十个指头不能一般长。”这样才进行下去。
    （二）用自报公议三榜定案方式，充分发扬民主；要划个人成份。
    要想使阶级成份定好，就必须用自报公议三榜定案的方法，充分发扬民主，并可予领导上考虑问题时间上的迂回余地。据多数村的情况是：第一榜，由于群众没有划的经验，同时有一部分群众打不破情面（特别是中农），容易马虎通过，所以毛病较大，划阶级还不是高潮时候。第二榜可与前大不同，再加上一划了个人成份，群众争论闲谈，男女老少，都在酝酿每户的成份，这是划阶级的高潮时期，这时解决问题也很多。绝大多数户都能正确确定（还不是定案）。第三榜在农代会成立后定案，定案前主要解决遗留问题，但不一定完全划清，可能有个别户圪倒不清，或本人坚持意见，经农代会审查通过后已搞清及本人没意见的户，一齐定案公布第三榜。没有农代会的成立或通不过，是不能定案的。因他是农村最高权力机关，同时也能提高他的领导威信。（按：照中央划阶级文件规定，第三榜应由全村村民大会逐一讨论通过——编者）。其次，应注意的是：一、有不少干部把三榜定案单纯的看成一种方式，而没有了解为啥要三榜，作用、精神是什么，所以在划阶级时，把三榜定案做成一种形式，如下郑等村，结果使群众不感兴趣，厌烦起来。在群众中也产生一种论遍思想，都想马上通过三遍就没事了。还有的村划时没根据实际情况，没从群众要求出发，在划时大部已公议，因少数没搞清，或没在家，而非等齐不行，使群众不耐烦起来。王岗、白错等村做得好，每一次榜都不因少数不清而不公布，第一榜后本人和群众都没意见的户就不一定再一个个过了，只将未划户、未弄清有意见的户，加以调查讨论搞清便可。出榜时仍一齐写上。农代会定案时，必须一户户详细审查，并要在平时吸收群众反映，不正确的要修改。
    定成份要做到人人不受屈，真正发扬民主，就必须划个人成份，划的重点是地富家受压迫的人和农民与地富之间相互招郎、买卖孩子、过继子、娶媳妇及一切靠单独立劳动维持生活的人们（医生、职员、手工业工人……等）。（也不一定每人都划，大部分人是与家属成份同的。）
    我们领导上只有讲、说、拨灯的义务，而没有决定成份的权利。每一个成份都要由群众决定，有坚持个人意见者，坚决给予保留，决不能以“少数服从多数”的办法将其个人意见压下。就是有个别户要告人民法庭判断的，我们也同样欢迎。在进行中，随时表明态度也很重要，以免群众不敢大胆打破一切思想上顾虑；这样才能做到一人不受屈。四、必须通过贫雇去串连中农，才能将阶级成份划好。巩固的团结中农，这是肯定的；但中农有些缺点也值得我们注意。在划阶级中，一般中农的情面较大，凡中农多的组最容易降低成份，模糊通过，有时表现随风倒。所以没有老实的有啥说啥的贫雇为骨干，成份一定划不好。（按：也必须注意，片面依靠贫雇也会出错误，容易提高成份。所以划阶级中也必须充分发动中农；而且也要让地主、富农、让每一个人都知道划阶级的标准，而且敢于申辩。——编者）
    （三）掌握群众要求，结合当前生产：
    当前群众正忙于紧张的春耕下种运动，更成问题的是有好些村子去年遭受旱、风、雹等灾，眼前没吃的户很多，他们当前的迫切要求是解决吃的问题。如果我们不与生产相结合，那就与群众要求相违背。由于划阶级的复杂，是需要开会的，但要尽量减少白天开，时间不要过长，工作还得做好，那就必须我们费脑筋想问题，会前充分准备，明确开会重点，在组织上工作步骤上要很好计划。上关划阶级第一次开妇女会，因准备不够，所以没开成，会后算了一下帐，纺织少赚米二百余斤。经检讨后，才及时修正，首先教育骨干，了解如何划阶级后，经她们串通，第二次召开了一个三十余人的妇女大会，时间又短，开的很成功。（王兴整理）
