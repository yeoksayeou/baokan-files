Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, April 25th: The Harbin City Federation of Trade Unions recently issued a notice to elect representatives of intellectuals to participate in the Second Harbin City Workers' Congress. The notice stated: All employed intellectuals (including engineers, technicians, doctors, nurses, journalists, school teachers, government and enterprise employees, etc.) have the right to elect representatives to participate in the congress. Since the liberation of Harbin, doctors, nurses, engineers, technicians, employees, and teachers have worked diligently in various constructions and have achieved results. At this congress, we must promote these achievements and experiences to further integrate mental and physical labor, so as to serve the people's revolutionary war and democratic construction more effectively in the future. Now, factories, shops, institutions, and organizations are enthusiastically electing representatives. Some intellectuals already have organized groups. It is hoped that those who have not yet organized will take this opportunity to elect representatives and quickly organize themselves and report to the Federation of Trade Unions to determine the number of representatives attending the congress.

    哈尔滨脑力劳动者参加该市工代大会
    【新华社东北二十五日电】哈尔滨市总工会日前发出通知，选举脑力劳动者代表参加哈市二届职工代表大会。通知略称：凡受雇用之脑力劳动者（包括工程师、技师、医生、护士、新闻工作者、学校教职员、政府及各企业职员等等）均有权选举代表参加大会。从哈市解放以来，医生、护士、工程师、技师、职员、教职员等埋头苦干从事各种建设，都有成绩。在这次大会上，要发扬这种成绩和经验，使脑力劳动和体力劳动更进一步结合起来，以便今后更有效的为人民革命战争与民主建设服务。现在各工厂、商店、机关、团体都在热烈选举代表，有些脑力劳动者已有团体组织，希望没有组织起来的借这次推选代表的机会，迅速组织起来，并报告总工会，以便确定出席大会代表名额。
