According to incomplete statistics from Heilongjiang, Nenjiang, Hejiang, Jilin and other provinces in North Manchuria, the local currency handed over by the people to the government for forwarding to the front lines amounted to more than 170 million yuan (equivalent to more than 8.5 billion yuan in Guannei Chiang currency), more than 100 taels of gold, more than 2,000 taels of silver, more than 10,000 fat pigs, and a large number of chickens, rice, white flour, and yellow tobacco, etc. The masses in Fusong County, South Manchuria, also donated more than 5,900 jin of ginseng. Women in Andong City have completed 40,000 pairs of military shoes and are still working hard to make more. Schools and mass organizations in various places have organized comfort teams and theater troupes to go to the front lines to offer their regards. The front lines are holding military-civilian get-togethers, with the military and civilians encouraging each other to win more victories in the front and step up production in the rear to welcome even greater victories.

　　我东北各地人民热烈慰劳解放军
    【新华社东北三十一日电】东北解放区各地人民为庆祝关内外解放军大捷，掀起广泛的劳军热潮。近据北满黑龙江、嫩江、合江、吉林等省不完全统计，各地人民交由政府转送前方的本币即达一亿七千余万元（合关内蒋币八十五亿余元）、金子一百余两、白银两千余两、肥猪一万余口，及大批鸡子、大米、白面、黄烟等。南满抚松县群众并献人参五千九百余斤。安东市妇女已完成四万双军鞋，仍在继续赶制中。各地学校及群众团体皆组织慰问队及剧团赶赴前方慰劳。前线则举行军民联欢会，军民互相鼓励以前方多打胜仗，后方加紧大生产迎接更巨大的胜利。
