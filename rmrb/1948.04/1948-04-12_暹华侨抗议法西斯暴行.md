Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th -- Bangkok dispatch: The progressive Chinese newspapers and democratic organizations here have risen up to protest the atrocities of the reactionary government of Phraya Apai Phuban for illegally arresting several leading overseas Chinese democrats. It is reliably learned that this move by the Siamese fascists was ordered to directly cooperate with the anti-communist clamor manufactured by American imperialism, and to use this as a smokescreen for Luang Phibunsongkhram, the chief culprit in anti-communist and anti-democratic crimes, to instigate a new anti-Chinese bloodbath. Encouraged by Chiang Kai-shek's policy of suppressing the overseas Chinese democratic movement, this anti-Chinese conspiracy by the Siamese reactionaries is now accelerating.

　　暹华侨抗议法西斯暴行
    【新华社陕北八日电】曼谷讯：此间华侨各进步报纸及民主团体，群起抗议亚拜横反动政府非法逮捕若干华侨民主领袖的暴行。据确悉：暹罗法西斯分子此举，系奉命直接配合美帝国主义所制造的反共叫嚣，并图以此为反共反民主首犯銮披汶策动新的排华血案制造烟幕；暹反动派此种排华阴谋在蒋匪压制华侨民主运动政策鼓励下，现正在加速进行中。
