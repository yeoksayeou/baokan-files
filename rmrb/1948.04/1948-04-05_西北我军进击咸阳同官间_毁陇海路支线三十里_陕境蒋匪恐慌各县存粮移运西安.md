Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: The People's Liberation Army unit's achievements in destroying the Xianyang-Tongguan branch line of the Longhai Railway from the 24th to the 26th of last month included dismantling 30 li of railway, blowing up five bridges, destroying one locomotive and 31 carriages, capturing 62 puppet security team members, and seizing 35 long and short guns, as well as some grain, ammunition, and Chiang currency. In addition, a local armed force in Guanzhong cooperated with the main force on the 26th to destroy about 3 li of railway on the Yaoxian to Zhuanglilizhen (southeast of Yaoxian) section, destroying two highway bridges, annihilating puppet security offices, and seizing 10 long and short guns and more than 60 jin of electric wire.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: After the People's Liberation Army's great victory in Yichuan, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shaanxi Province are in extreme panic. On March 10th, the Xi'an Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Security Command issued a secret order: "All counties should cooperate with local armed forces to strengthen guarding of various passes and river crossings along the Jing (River) and Wei (River), and the Yuko areas on the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains." However, the bandit official from ＠邑 County government who delivered the secret order was captured by our army just after leaving the city gate. The bandits inside the city were extremely disturbed, tightly closing the city gates, cutting off pedestrian traffic, and wantonly felling trees in temples to be used as fuel. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Sanyuan, Chunhua, Yaoxian, Jingyang and other county towns also closed their city gates all day long, and even people with "identity cards" were not allowed to enter the city. Grain reserves in various county warehouses were being transferred to Xi'an in a rush. An order from the bandit Chunhua County government, which we recently captured, stated: "According to the provincial government's order, due to the emergency of the military situation, the public grain stored in various counties must be rushed to Xi'an within a week, otherwise, those who delay the war effort will be punished by military law." The Sanyuan Chiang Bandit Transportation Bureau, Farmers' Association, and Shaanxi Provincial Bank's branch have all ceased operations and moved to Xi'an. The property of bandits at all levels in the county is also competing to escape to Xi'an, and Sanyuan Station is in utter chaos.

　　西北我军进击咸阳同官间
  　毁陇海路支线三十里
    陕境蒋匪恐慌各县存粮移运西安
    【新华社西北三日电】解放军某部上月二十四至二十六日破击陇海铁路咸（阳）同（官）支线之战果，计拆毁铁路三十里，炸毁桥梁五座，毁火车头一个，车皮三十一个，俘伪保警队六十二名，缴长短枪三十五支及粮食、弹药、蒋币各一部。另关中地方武装一部二十六日配合主力，破击耀县至庄里镇（耀县东南）段铁路三里许，毁公路桥梁二座，歼灭伪保公所，缴长短枪十支，电线六十多斤。
    【新华社西北三日电】解放军在宜川大捷后，陕境蒋匪，极度恐慌。三月十日西安蒋匪保安司令部曾发出密令：“各县配合地方武装对各关口及泾（河）渭（河）各渡口，秦岭北麓峪口等处，加强守望”。但匪＠邑县府送密令的人，刚出城门即被我军俘获。城内匪众因而极形不安，紧闭城门，断绝行人，并在城内大肆砍伐庙宇林木，充作燃料。三原、淳化、耀县、泾阳等县城蒋匪亦终日关起城门，老百姓虽持有“身份证”，也不许进城。各县仓库存粮则纷向西安移运。日前我缴获之匪淳化县政府命令中称：“奉省府命，以军事形势紧急，各县所存公粮，限周内抢运至西安，否则贻误戎机，军法治罪”。三原蒋匪交通、农民、陕西省三银行分行，均已停止营业，迁往西安。县内匪各级官员财物，亦竞相向西安逃逸，三原车站混乱不堪。
