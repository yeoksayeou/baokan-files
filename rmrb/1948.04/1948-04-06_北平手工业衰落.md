Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Beiping News: Beiping's various renowned handicraft industries are rapidly declining. The cloisonné (note: cloisonné is a type of bronze ware) industry, which once won a first-class prize at the World Expo, has seen more than half of its manufacturers close down, leaving only about forty large and small businesses. The carpet industry, based on the number of factories joining the association, has plummeted from a peak of 250 before the war to 26 before the year. During the same period, the total output of various factories (including those not joining the association) also decreased from 1.04 million square feet to 180,000 square feet. Other industries are also in decline. The former Wai Xihe Yan, once known as "Ivory Street," in the ivory carving industry, now has only nine businesses struggling to survive. Yan Zengyi, the manager of Yushengxiang in the industry, sighed and said: "In the past, exports accounted for 70% of the total output, but after the Anti-Japanese War, it dropped to 20%, and now we can only do half of what we did after the Anti-Japanese War." Yao Fusheng, the shopkeeper of Shengli Lacquerware Store, said: "In short, our line of work is not easy!" He also pointed out that the so-called "loans" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government are actually a kind of "extortion." In addition to massive unemployment, the lives of workers in various handicraft industries in Beiping are also extremely difficult. Enamel workers earn only one to two million yuan per month, while clerks earn only several hundred thousand, and apprentices earn 200,000 yuan, which is only enough to buy a few liters of rice.

　　北平手工业衰落
    【新华社陕北四日电】北平讯：北平各种著名手工业已日趋衰落。曾得万国博览会一等奖凭之景泰蓝（按景泰蓝系一种铜器）业，制造厂家已有半数以上歇业，现仅剩大小四十余家。地毯业以加入公会厂数计，则已由战前最盛时期的二百五十家猛减至年前的廿六家，同时期各厂总产量（包括未入公会者在内）亦由一百另四万方英尺减至十八万方英尺。其他各业亦均衰萎不振。昔日被称为“象牙街”的前外西河沿，象牙虬角业，现仅剩九家勉强支持，该业玉生祥经理阎增义叹气的说：“从前出口货要占总产量的百分之七十，抗战后降落到百分之二十，如今能做的，也仅仅是抗战后的二分之一而已。”升利雕漆行的掌柜姚福升说：“总而言之，我们这一行不好做啦！”他并指出蒋匪政府的所谓“贷款”，其实是一种“敲诈”。北平手工业各业职工除大量失业外，在业者生活亦极困苦。珐琅业工人每人每月收入不过一二百万元，柜上的人只有几十万，学徒则为二十万元，只够买几升米。
