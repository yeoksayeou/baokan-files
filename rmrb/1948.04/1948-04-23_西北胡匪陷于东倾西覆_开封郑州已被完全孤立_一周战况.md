Northwest Battlefield: The People's Liberation Army continues to advance into the Jiang-occupied areas. On the 17th, our powerful army advanced into the vast area north of the Jing River, recaptured the ＠邑 county seat in one fell swoop, crossed the Jing River to the south, cut off the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, and annihilated more than 1,200 enemy troops. It is now continuing to advance. Since Yan'an was isolated and Luochuan was besieged, the bandit troops, in order to support Luochuan, reluctantly gathered more than 80,000 people and occupied Yijun on the 11th. On the 14th, they tentatively advanced, moving forward 15 miles in two days, but on the 16th, they were met head-on by our army, and the bandits immediately turned around and fled south. Our army chased all the way south of Yijun. Now, the siege on the northern front has not been lifted, and the western front is also in urgent need. The bandit troops are even more in a situation of eastern collapse and western overthrow.

Central Plains Front: Following the recapture of Xinzheng, Xuchang, Yancheng, Queshan, Suiping and other cities in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, our army recaptured Xiping County on the 9th. On the night of the 12th, we launched a sabotage campaign between Minquan and Lanfeng on the Longhai Railway, completely destroying the section of the railway and occupying the Nei Huang and Yejigang stations. On the 13th, we expanded our gains and captured Minquan County and the station. The Yu-Shaanxi-Ebei People's Liberation Army liberated Guangwu and Mi County on the outskirts of Zhengzhou on the night of the 12th, and the Jiang bandits in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou were isolated. On the 16th, the Jianghan Military Region's People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 1,000 Jiang bandits, including the regiment commander of the First Regiment of the Seventeenth Brigade, in Sanyangdian, north of Jingshan.

Our local armed forces and liberated peasant armed forces on the southern front also actively launched attacks, captured and annihilated Jiang bandits, and liberated towns. The local armed forces of Yu-Shaanxi-Ebei liberated Xunyang County on the north bank of the Han River in southern Shaanxi on the 13th, and recovered Dengfeng County on the 16th. The Yu-Shaanxi-Ebei Third Military Sub-district local armed forces completely annihilated or largely annihilated the enemy, annihilating a part of the Second Regiment of the Jiang bandit's Lushi Self-Defense Column on the 1st, capturing more than 320 enemy troops. On the 14th, the Tongbai Military Region annihilated more than 2,000 men of the pseudo-Biyang Security Regiment northwest of Biyang City, including the captured Regiment Commander Zhang Chengxiang and more than 1,300 men. On the 29th of last month, at Luguan Camp, 30 miles south of Nanyang City, the entire Second Regiment of the Jiang bandit Henan Security Force was annihilated, capturing the enemy's deputy battalion commander and more than 300 men, including four company commanders. On the 7th, the Jianghan Military Region annihilated two squadrons of Jiang bandits at Sanyi River, east of Shashi, killing, wounding and capturing more than 120 enemy troops, including the squadron leader. The local armed forces of Shucheng, Huoshan, and Taiping (newly established county, border area of Zhuwumiao, Huoshan, Yingshan, and Jinjiazai) counties in the Anhui West Military Region have been continuously clearing out the fleeing local Jiang bandits. From the 25th of last month to the 12th of this month, a total of more than 200 enemies, including Shi Jiaxiang, the head of the Huoshan Self-Defense Battalion, were captured and annihilated. The Yansuling, Fugou, and Xihua local liberated peasant protection teams of Yu-Wan-Su, on the 3rd, blocked the Jiang bandit's entire Eleventh Division and other units that fled east from Xuchang and Changge to Yanling, killing and wounding more than 500 enemy troops. The local armed forces of Xiaoxian and Yancheng also annihilated more than 200 enemy troops below the battalion commander and crushed the Jiang bandits' "key mopping-up" of the Xiaoxian area.

In northern Jiangsu, our army recovered six important strongholds on the 6th, including Chenjiagang and Xiangshui, the famous distribution centers for Huai salt in the lower reaches of the Guan River, annihilating more than 1,300 men from five squadrons of the bandit salt police headquarters, including 1,100 enemy troops, including the captured enemy battalion commander Tang Qixi.

From the 1st to the 4th, our Jin-Cha-Ji army once recovered the three towns of Ba County, Xiong County, and Banjiawo, and recovered the vast areas surrounding them. On the 4th, our Sui-Mongolian local armed forces completely annihilated more than 100 remnants of the bandit Fu's supplementary training First Division fleeing from Liangcheng, and captured Xintang Town, east of Liangcheng, on the 13th. On the 6th, the Luliang local armed forces launched a sudden attack on the Yan bandit stronghold in Lingshi, winning all four battles in one day, annihilating more than 300 enemy troops; on the same day, south of Lingshi, a part of the Yan bandit security eighteenth regiment, which was robbing grain, was largely annihilated, with about 200 men.

In one week, our regular army and local armed forces on all fronts annihilated a total of 10,700 Jiang bandits. There were three uprisings in the Jiang army, totaling more than 110 people, liberating and recovering ten county seats and twenty important strongholds. (Xinhua News Agency)
