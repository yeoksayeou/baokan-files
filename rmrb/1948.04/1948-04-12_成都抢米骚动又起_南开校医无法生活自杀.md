Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Shanghai report: Another rice riot has recently erupted in Chengdu amidst soaring rice prices. On the 13th of last month, dozens of impoverished people, holding paper banners reading "Rice prices are soaring, the poor have nothing to eat," petitioned the Chiang bandit Sichuan provincial authorities for relief, but the bandit authorities completely ignored them. The next morning, large numbers of starving people from Chengdu County and the adjacent Wenjiang County looted rice. The bandit authorities were terrified and ordered the bandit police and other agencies to patrol and suppress the unrest strictly.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Tianjin report: Li Tingguang, director of the Nankai University medical clinic, committed suicide by drowning himself in a lake on the morning of the 7th due to the pressure of living. His wife, upon hearing the news, immediately attempted suicide by taking poison, but failed. Li's monthly salary was less than 9 million Chiang coins, and with soaring prices, he was unable to support his mother, wife, and five children, so he committed suicide in anger. Li was of pure character, and the students of Nankai University expressed their grief. According to an Associated Press report from Tianjin on the 8th, his suicide is expected to expand the anti-hunger strike by faculty and staff of the five universities in Peiping and Tianjin to fight for improved treatment.

Furthermore, the people of Pengxi County, Sichuan, are living in poverty, and there have been many cases of abandoned infants recently. On February 28th, an infant of about two months old was abandoned at Heitada Tan in the west of the city. Two eagles pecked at it, and its cries were miserable to hear.

　　成都抢米骚动又起
  　南开校医无法生活自杀
    【新华社陕北十日电】沪报讯：成都在米价暴涨中近又发生饥民抢米骚动。上月十三日贫民数十人手执“米价高涨，贫民无吃”之纸旗向蒋匪川省当局请求救济，匪当局竟置之不理。次日晨成都县境及毗连的温江县境均有大批饥民抢米。匪当局惶恐万分，下令匪警备部等机关严密巡逻镇压。
    【新华社陕北十日电】天津讯：南开大学校医主任李廷光为生活压迫，于七日晨投湖自杀毙命，其妻闻讯后即服毒自杀，未果。李氏月薪不足蒋币九百万元，在物价暴涨下，无法养活一母一妻五子，故愤而自杀。李氏品性纯良，南大学生咸表痛惜。据美联社天津八日电指出：他的自杀预料将使平、津五大学教职员反饥饿争取改善待遇的罢教运动扩大。
    又讯：四川蓬溪县人民生活困苦，近来弃婴特多，二月二十八日城西之黑搭坦弃有约两月大的婴儿，被老鹰两只啄食，哭声嘤嘤，惨不忍闻。
