    Creating a Model for Correctly Implementing Policies
    The masses and Party member cadres in Baiguan Village, Wu'an County, have thoroughly investigated the "root causes" from model villages nearby that had undergone Party rectification and democratic supplementary work. They understand our policies towards all classes. They know that during "movements," there should be no beating, no suspension, no withholding, no coercion, no revenge, no wrongful accusations. Instead, we should reason, seek truth from facts, handle matters fairly, distinguish right from wrong, and transform ideology and work style to improve the ranks. They are all willing to rectify and want to do it quickly. The masses are highly motivated and hope to start quickly in the gaps after planting cotton. This fact tells us how important it is to create a model for correctly implementing policies! It also tells us how important it is to be cautious and meticulous when creating a model. If good models are created in one or several villages at the beginning, the impact and driving force will be significant.
    However, creating a model is not an easy task. The most important thing is to resolutely implement the Party's policies. The policy boundaries must be very clear, and everything must be done in accordance with the policies, without any discount. Anything that is not stipulated or not allowed in the policies must be resolutely avoided. Without implementing the Party's policies and guidelines, the work loses its soul, and there is no such thing as a model. For many years, some comrades have been indulging in liberalism and seeking independence from the Party, almost as a habit. They do not resolutely implement the Party's policies, but come up with their own set of rules, doing whatever they want. If the higher authorities say that what they are doing does not conform to the Party's policies, they say with great confidence: "This is the opinion of the masses, this is the mass line!" or "You don't understand the actual situation!" They use this as an excuse to threaten the Party and resist the higher authorities. Some leading comrades even refuse to study and research the Party's policies diligently themselves, and do not allow others to read the documents, saying: "What's the point of reading these dogmas?" They regard the Party's policies as "dogmas." How can they do their work well if they are so indifferent to the Party's policies?! How can they create good models?! Therefore, we suggest that all comrades participating in leading the Party rectification and democratic movement should carefully study and research the Party's policies and guidelines, implement the Party's policies and guidelines, and be cautious in creating models! Otherwise, if mistakes occur in the implementation of policies and the work is messed up, "one rotten apple can spoil the whole barrel," it will inevitably create difficulties for future work in other places.

    创造正确执行政策的典型
    武安百官村群众和党员干部，已从附近进行过整党民主抽补工作的典型村庄，探问清楚了“根底”，了解了我们对各阶层的政策；知道“搞运动”时，不打、不吊、不扣、不逼，不许报复，不冤屈人；而是讲道理，求实际，办事公平，是非分明，改造思想作风，把队伍整好。他们都愿意整，而且愿意快整，群众情绪高涨，希望在种罢棉花的空隙快作起来。这件事实告诉我们，创造正确执行政策的典型是如何的重要！也告诉我们，创造典型更要如何的需要慎重细致。如果开头在一个或几个村庄创造出来好的典型，影响与推动作用是很大的。
    但是创造典型是一件不容易的事情。其中最重要的，是要坚决执行贯彻党的政策，政策界限必须十分明确，一切按照政策办事，凡是政策上所规定了的，一律照着去办，不折不扣。没有规定的或不允许的，就坚决不要做。不贯彻党的政策方针，工作就失去了灵魂，就无所谓什么典型。有些同志多年以来，自由主义，向党闹独立性，几乎已成习惯，不坚决执行党的政策，另来一套，爱怎样做就怎样做，上级如说他这样做不合乎党的政策，他很理直气壮的说：“这是群众意见，这是群众路线！”或者说：“你不了解实际情况！”以此借口来威胁党，抵抗上级。甚至还有的领导同志，自己不虚心学习研究党的政策，还不让其他人看文件，说：“看这教条干啥？”把党的政策竟看成“教条”，如此漠视党的政策，怎能把工作做好？！怎么能创造出好的典型？！因此，我们建议，凡参加领导整党民主运动的同志，好好学习研究党的政策方针，执行贯彻党的政策方针，慎重创造典型！否则执行政策发生错误，把工作搞坏，“一块臭肉可坏满锅汤”，必然给其他地方将来的工作上造下困难。
