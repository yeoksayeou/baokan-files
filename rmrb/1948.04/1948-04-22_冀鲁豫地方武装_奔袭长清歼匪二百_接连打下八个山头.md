Ji-Lu-Yu Local Armed Forces
    Raid Changqing, Annihilating 200 Bandits, Consecutively Capturing Eight Hilltops
    [Ji-Lu-Yu News] Delayed Report: On February 25th, local troops from our First Military Sub-district, covering a distance of one hundred li, raided the Jiang bandit strongholds of Xiaomashan, Zhouzhuang, and Duandian in the Seventh District of Changqing. In this battle, 77 enemies were captured, over 110 were killed, and 3 light machine guns, 34 rifles and carbines, 1,359 rounds of ammunition, and over 500 jin of wool were seized.

    Further Dispatch: On the night of the 25th, Unit 201 was ordered to attack Xiaomashan in the Seventh District of Changqing. Before the battle even began, Sun Lianlu, a platoon leader of the Second Company, First Battalion, requested to lead the main assault on behalf of the entire platoon. The leaders granted their request. The attack began at 10 o'clock, and the hero Sun Lianlu led his entire platoon in a strong assault on the hilltop. In less than an hour, Xiaomashan was taken. As the battle had just ended, enemy reinforcements arrived. The original task of intercepting the reinforcements was assigned to the First Company, but they did not consider their own fatigue and engaged the enemy reinforcements at the front. They also cooperated with the First Company, serving as an assault platoon, and launched a strong attack under the enemy's intense machine-gun fire. The enemy was completely eliminated using hand grenades. They captured five hilltops in one go. At this time, Sun Lianlu was gloriously wounded. Squad Leader Chen of the Fourth Platoon proposed, "Avenge the platoon leader and fight resolutely!" Sun Lianlu did not leave the front line after being wounded. He and Squad Leader Chen led the entire platoon and successively captured three more hilltops, completing the glorious continuous assault mission.
