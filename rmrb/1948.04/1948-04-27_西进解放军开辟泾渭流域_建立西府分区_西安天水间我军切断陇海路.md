    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th. The westward advancing People's Liberation Army has established the West Prefecture Sub-district in the newly liberated areas along the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, administering seven counties: Changwu, ＠ County, Yongshou, Qianxian, Liquan, Linyou, and Lingtai. On the 23rd, the Northwest Central Bureau, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Joint Defense Military Region officially appointed Li Jingying and Gao Feng as the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the West Prefecture Sub-district CCP Committee, Yang Bolun and Zhao Jinfeng as the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of the Commissioner's Office, and Zhao Bojing and Zhang Zhanyun as the Commander and Deputy Commander of the Military Sub-district, with Li Jingying and Wu Jianren as the Political Commissar and Deputy Political Commissar of the Military Sub-district. This sub-district is the second one established in the newly liberated areas after the Huanglong Sub-district. It is strategically located in the Longshan Mountains, a vital transportation hub on the Shaanxi-Gansu Highway, situated in the fertile Jingwei River Basin. The terrain is strategically important, the products are abundant, and the population is dense, making it a strategically valuable area for liberating the Great Northwest.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th. The Northwest People's Liberation Army has advanced to the Longhai Railway line between Xi'an and Tianshui. After liberating Fufeng city on the 22nd, the army continued its southward advance and captured the Jiangzhang Town and Wenshu Town stations on the Longhai Railway southeast of Fufeng on the same day, controlling more than 30 li of the railway line.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th. The local armed forces of the First Sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia pursued and annihilated the fleeing enemies from the Leicun and Qunan strongholds, 40 li southwest of ＠ County, on the evening of the 21st, capturing more than 240 officers and soldiers, killing 19 including the puppet security police captain Yan Yunguang, liberating more than 70 captured civilians, and seizing 10 light machine guns, 186 rifles and short guns, and 11 mules and horses. We suffered no casualties.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th. After the recovery of ＠yi city on the 17th, the "City Management Committee" organized by a unit of the People's Liberation Army immediately carried out management and reception work, and sent out pickets to maintain order and guard cultural institutions. When the unit accepted new tasks and left the city, all captured personnel, weapons, and enemy and puppet materials were transferred to the democratic government. The unit's strict discipline has won widespread praise. Businesses in the city have resumed operations one after another. According to the owner of Yongxingyuan store, he made more profit in one day than he did in a whole year under the rule of the bandits. Students of ＠yi Middle School held a joint celebration with the People's Liberation Army propaganda team on the day the city was recovered. After our army took the initiative to withdraw from ＠yi County last July, the democratic county government has always adhered to the vast rural areas to protect the masses, so that the "decrees" of the puppet county government did not go beyond two li from the city suburbs. The local people sarcastically called the Chiang bandit county magistrate Jin a "Jin Baozhang" (Jin neighborhood chief). In this battle, the local people organized stretcher teams to send military food and grind flour to support the People's Liberation Army, and the women worked day and night to make 2,000 pairs of military shoes. The people in the suburbs of the city also built bridges and led the way for the People's Liberation Army and blocked news from the enemy. (Attached picture)

    西进解放军开辟泾渭流域
    建立西府分区
    西安天水间我军切断陇海路
    【新华社西北二十五日电】西进解放军已在西兰公路新解放区建立西府分区，辖长武、＠县、永寿、乾县、醴泉、麟游、灵台七个县。二十三日西北中央局、陕甘宁边区政府、陕甘宁、晋绥联防军区已分别正式委任李景膺、高峰任西府分区中共地委正副书记，杨伯伦、赵锦峰任专员公署正副专员，赵伯经、张占云任军分区正副司令员，李景膺、吴剑人任军分区正副政治委员。该分区为继黄龙分区之后在新解放区建立的第二个分区，该区雄踞陇山山脉，是陕甘交通公路要冲，居泾渭流域沃野，形势险要，物产丰富，人口稠密，为解放大西北具战略价值之地区。
    【新华社西北二十五日电】西北人民解放军已进抵西安天水间的陇海铁路线上，大军自二十二日解放扶风城后，即乘胜南下，于同日攻占扶风东南陇海路上的绛帐镇及文书镇等车站，控制铁路线三十余里。
    【新华社西北二十五日电】陕甘宁一分区地方武装，二十一日晚追歼＠县西南四十里雷村、曲南两据点逃敌，俘官兵二百四十多名，击毙伪保警队长雁云光以下十九名，解放被俘群众七十多人，缴轻机枪十挺，长短枪一百八十六支，骡马十一匹，我无伤亡。
    【新华社西北二十五日电】十七日＠邑城收复后，解放军某部组织的“城市管理委员会”立即进行管理和接收工作，并派出纠察队维持秩序，守护文化机关。当该部接受新任务离城时，所有俘获之人枪及敌伪物资全部移交民主政府。该部纪律严明，深得各方赞誉，现该城商号已纷纷复业。据永兴源店主说：他作了一天的生意，就顶胡匪统治时一年的买卖。该城＠邑中学学生并在收复该城当日即与解放军宣传队举行联欢庆祝。去年七月我军主动撤离＠邑县城后，民主县政府始终坚持广大乡村阵地，保护群众，使伪县政府之“政令”，不出城郊二里。当地群众都讽刺蒋匪县长金某为金保长。此次战斗中当地人民即纷纷组织担架队，送军粮磨面支援解放军，妇女并星夜赶作军鞋二千双，城郊人民并为解放军架桥带路、对敌封锁消息等。（附图片）
