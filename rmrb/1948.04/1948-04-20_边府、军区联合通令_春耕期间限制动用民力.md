　　Joint Circular from the Border Government and Military Region
  　Restricting the Use of Civilian Labor During Spring Plowing
    [Our Dispatch] In order to care for the shortage of labor and animal power, and vigorously carry out the spring plowing campaign to ensure military and civilian food supplies, the Border Region Government and Military Region Headquarters jointly issued a circular on April 15, the full text of which is as follows:

    In order to care for the shortage of labor and animal power, and vigorously carry out the spring plowing campaign to ensure military and civilian food supplies, the following measures are specifically decided to restrict the use of civilian labor during spring plowing:

    (1) During the spring plowing period, the use of civilian labor must comply with the following regulations: 1. Except for stretchers and civilian laborers necessary for combat, and the transport of firearms, ammunition, grain, provisions, clothing, and medicine for the front, all other labor services shall be suspended. 2. The transfer of sick and wounded soldiers and disabled veterans who cannot walk along the way should conserve civilian labor as much as possible (such as changing stretchers to livestock, two or three people sharing one head of livestock, etc.). Those who waste civilian labor shall be punished and publicized in the newspaper. 3. Except for military hospitals and Veterans Rehabilitation Homes, all grain consumption by any rear-area organs and troops must be transported by themselves; the transportation of martyrs' coffins shall be suspended. Other items such as clothing, utility poles, wires, porcelain insulators, pigments, military industrial equipment, and transportation equipment shall be suspended unless urgently needed and specially approved by the Border Government or Administrative Office. 4. Except for necessary plowing on behalf of military families and families of martyrs, and for the cooperative plowing of land for militiamen and civilian laborers participating in the war, all village miscellaneous duties such as: guarding rear area stations, sentry duty, guarding cases, delivering letters, errands, odd jobs, plowing on behalf of government and village cadres, repairing or building houses for military families, carrying water, chopping firewood, and providing the stationed military organs with house repairs or sewing, washing, carrying water, cooking, milling, and moving houses, transferring family members for organs and groups, and transferring cadres, must be absolutely prohibited. 5. Approved water conservancy and civil engineering projects must also be coordinated with the local government to ensure that civilian laborers are not delayed in sowing, weeding, and harvesting wheat.

    (2) During the spring plowing period, when any organs, groups, or troops use civilian labor, except for the transfer of sick and wounded soldiers and disabled veterans who cannot walk along the way, the head of the political department at or above the column or military region level must be responsible for signing and stamping a letter of introduction, which must be approved by the Border Government or Administrative Office before it can be disbursed; the front must be disbursed through the logistics headquarters.

    (3) During the spring plowing period, regardless of any department or individual, if labor is requisitioned without following these measures or without following the prescribed procedures, the district and village governments shall strictly refuse. Those who use coercive or threatening behavior shall have the government personnel sent to the county government, and the military personnel sent to the original unit's superior organ for handling.

    (4) The starting and ending dates of the spring plowing shall be determined and announced by each Administrative Office.

    During the spring plowing period, the use of civilian labor must be carefully calculated to achieve less mobilization and rapid demobilization, overcome any waste of civilian labor, and be good at organizing civilian laborers to help with spring plowing on the spot, so as to ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing. It is hoped that you will immediately relay this to your subordinates and resolutely implement it.

    【本报消息】为在春耕期间限制动用民力，边区政府与军区司令部，于四月十五日发出联合通令，全文如下：
    为了照顾劳畜力困难，大力开展春耕运动，以保证军需民食，特决定春耕期间限制动用民力办法如下：
    （一）春耕期间动用民力须依下列规定：一、除作战必要用之担架民工，及供应前方的枪械弹药粮秣被服医药等可运输外，其他支差一律停止。二、沿途转送军队之伤病人员及不能行走之荣誉军人，均应尽量节省民力（如改担架为牲畜，两人或三人伙用一头牲口等），如有浪费民力情事，应予以处分，并登报公布。三、除军医院、荣教院外，任何后方机关部队之吃粮，均须自运；烈士灵柩停运，其他如被服、电杆、电线、瓷头颜料及军工器材，交通器材，除有急需经边府、行署特准者外，一律停拨。四、除为军烈属必要之代耕及参战的民兵民工之土地变工耕种外，一切村杂差如：后方站岗、放哨、看案、送信、听差、打杂，给政民村干代耕，给军属修盖房屋、担水、打柴，以及给驻军机关修盖房屋或缝洗、担水、做饭、磨面，机关团体搬家转送家属，调动干部等，均须绝对禁止。五、业已批准修筑之水利、土木工程，亦必须和当地政府配合，保证民工不误下种、锄苗、收麦。
    （二）春耕期间，任何机关团体部队，运用民力时，除沿途转送伤病员及不能行走之荣誉军人外，均须由纵队或军区以上政治部门首长负责签名盖章介绍，经边府或行署批准支拨；前方须经后勤指挥部支拨。
    （三）春耕期间，不论任何部门或个人，不依本办法或不按规定手续要差，区、村政府应一律严加拒绝，如有强迫威胁行为者，政民人员送县政府，军人送原部队上级机关处理。
    （四）春耕起迄日期，由各行署订定公布之。
    春耕期间，使用民力，尤须精确计算，作到少动员速复员，克服任何浪费民力现象，并要善于组织民工就地帮助春耕，务使春耕能顺利进行，希即转饬所属，坚决执行为要。
