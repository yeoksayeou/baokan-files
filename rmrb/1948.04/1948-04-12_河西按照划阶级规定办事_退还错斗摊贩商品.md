　　He Xi Handles Matters According to Class Division Regulations
  　Returns Confiscated Goods to Wrongfully Accused Vendor
    [Our Dispatch] During the review in He Xi Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, last autumn, because of investigating three generations of family history, the peddler Guai Manshan (whose father was the large landlord Zhang Xilin of He Xi Village), who had already transformed his class status, had his sundries confiscated by mistake. At that time, because everyone was busy with the autumn harvest, the goods had not yet been distributed to the masses. This time, when filling in the distribution of the remaining fruits of the harvest, the masses brought out the sundries, preparing to distribute needles and thread. After the work team discovered this, they immediately persuaded the masses to stop the distribution, explaining that according to the regulations regarding the division of classes and their treatment, the main status of peddlers is that of independent laborers and the exploited, and their interests should be resolutely protected. Many of the masses immediately said, "He relies on this carrying-pole to make a living; it's wrong to confiscate it." Everyone voluntarily packed up the needles and thread that had already been separated, storing them in their original state, ready to be returned. When Guai Manshan heard this news, he quickly rushed over from Yangyi. The Agricultural Committee asked him to carefully check each item in the sundries and return everything as it was. Guai Manshan was unexpectedly happy and offered to donate a barrel of needles to the women for their use. The members of the Agricultural Committee firmly refused and said to him, "It was already wrong to confiscate your goods; we can't take your needles again, or we'll be making a mistake."

　　河西按照划阶级规定办事
  　退还错斗摊贩商品
    【本报消息】武安九区河西村去秋复查时，因为查三代，将已转化成份的小商贩拐满山（他父亲是河西村的大地主张锡林）的杂货担子，错误的没收了。当时因为忙于秋收，尚未分给群众。这次填补分配剩余果实，群众搬出杂货担子准备分针线。工作组发现后，立即说服群众，停止分配，说明按照各阶级的划分及其待遇的规定，小商贩的主要地位是独立劳动者和被剥削者，他们的利益应受到坚决的保护。当场许多群众说：“人家就是靠这个担子过活，没收了不应该。”大家自动将已分开的针线，原样装存起来，准备退还。拐满山听到这个消息，很快由阳邑赶来，农委会请他将杂货担里的东西一件件查点清楚，原物退还。拐满山意外地高兴，提出要将一桶针拥护给妇女们使用，农会委员们坚决拒绝了，并向他说：“过去没收你的货担已经不对了，咱再不能要你的针，要就犯了错误啦。”
