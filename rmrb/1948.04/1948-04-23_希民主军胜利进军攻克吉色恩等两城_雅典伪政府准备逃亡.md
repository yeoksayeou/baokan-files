　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Combining reports from Athens and broadcasts from Free Greece Radio: The Greek Democratic Army recently launched victorious attacks on enemy cities that were relatively undefended, taking advantage of the enemy's concentration of forces in an attempt to salvage their failed "offensive" in the mountains. In central Greece, the Democratic Army attacked the city of Kalifly, south of Karditsa, and the city of Farsala. During the attack on Farsala, they destroyed roads, occupied the airport, and seized important ammunition depots. In the Peloponnese, at dawn on the 11th, the Democratic Army stormed into the northern city of Kalavryta. Another guerrilla force raided the southern city of Gythio at night, releasing fifteen arrested democrats. In these attacks by the Democratic Army, the puppet army suffered heavy losses in personnel and weapons.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Athens dispatch: The Greek puppet government, shocked by the strength of the Democratic Army and its threatening proximity to the suburbs of Athens, is hastily preparing to flee to the Dodecanese Islands and the island of Chios. According to a TASS report on the 16th, the chaos and panic within the Athens fascist government has reached such a degree that all military and police forces in Athens have been mobilized to defend this tottering bandit den. Puppet Prime Minister Sophoulis lamented to his cabinet members on March 19th, saying, "Since the domestic situation may soon greatly deteriorate, the government may evacuate to other cities." Subsequently, all puppet government agencies were ordered to prepare to transport all files and documents to the Dodecanese Islands, leaving only the most urgently needed files in Athens. The puppet government has also appointed a special committee to make arrangements on the island of Chios. In addition, with the support of U.S. imperialism, the puppet government is stepping up its defenses in the Dodecanese Islands and expelling "unstable" elements from there.

　　希民主军胜利进军攻克吉色恩等两城
  　雅典伪政府准备逃亡
    【新华社陕北二十日电】综合雅典消息和自由希腊电台广播：希民主军最近乘敌集中兵力企图挽救其对山地的失败“攻势”，向比较空虚的敌城市进行胜利出击。在希中部，民主军攻击了卡尔狄萨以南的卡利弗利城和发尔沙罗斯城。在攻击发城时，曾破坏了公路，占领了飞机场和重要军火库。在摩里亚半岛，十一日破晓，民主军曾攻入北部的卡拉夫鲁塔城。另一支游击队曾于夜晚袭入南部的吉色恩城，释放被捕的民主分子十五人。在民主军这些出击中，伪军的兵员武器损失甚重。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】雅典讯：希腊伪政府为民主军的强大及迫近雅典近郊的威势所震惊，正慌忙准备逃亡到多得喀尼斯群岛及开俄斯岛上。据塔斯社十六日报导：雅典法西斯政府的混乱与恐慌已达如此程度，刻已动员雅典全部军警来守卫这个摇摇欲坠的匪巢。伪总理索福利斯于三月十九日向其阁员哀鸣说：“由于国内局势不久或将大大恶化，政府可能疏散到其他城市。”接着，伪政府各机关就奉命准备把一切案卷公文都运到多得喀尼斯群岛，只将最迫切需要的案卷留在雅典，伪政府并已委派特别委员会到开俄斯岛布置。此外，伪政府在美帝支助之下，正加紧在多得喀尼斯群岛设防，并驱逐那里的“不稳”分子。
