[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to unify currency and prosper the economy, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee issued a joint announcement on April 15th. The full text is as follows:

Since the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei regions have been completely integrated; the division created by the Japanese puppets has been broken. The interactions between merchants and the circulation of goods are increasing day by day. However, because the currencies of the two regions are not unified, and the exchange cannot fully meet the needs of merchants, artificial obstacles still exist in commercial circulation, and merchants in both regions feel inconvenienced. Now, in order to facilitate merchants and prosper the economy, this government and committee jointly issue the following orders:

1.  From April 15th of this year, the Ji鈔 (Ji Bank currency) issued by the Ji'nan Bank and the 边鈔 (Border Region currency) issued by the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bank will be allowed to circulate mutually in all areas of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region. All taxes and public and private funds will be accepted in both Ji鈔 and 边鈔.

2.  The exchange rate between Ji'nan Bank notes and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Bank notes is fixed at one to ten, and will not change thereafter. That is, one yuan of Ji鈔 is equivalent to ten yuan of 边鈔. All taxes and public and private funds in any place in the two regions shall be circulated and paid according to this exchange rate, and no one shall be allowed to change it.

3.  From now on, the currencies of the two regions will circulate according to the above exchange rate. Regardless of public or private merchants, anyone who engages in buying and selling currency, disrupting finance, or monopolizing materials will be severely punished once discovered.

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会联合布告
    统一货币繁荣经济
    【本报消息】为统一货币繁荣经济，晋冀鲁豫边区政府与晋察冀边区行政委员会于四月十五日发出联合布告，原文如下：
    自从石家庄解放以后，晋冀鲁豫与晋察冀两区，已经完全打成一片；日伪造成的分割局面，已经打破。民商来往同货物流通，一天天都在增加着。可是因为两区货币不统一，兑换也不能完全满足民商的需要，使得商业流通，还存在着人为的障碍，两区民商都感到不方便。现在为了便利民商，繁荣经济，本府、会特联合发布下列命令：
    一、从本年四月十五日开始，冀南银行发行的冀钞与晋察冀边区银行发行的边钞，在晋冀鲁豫边区与晋察冀边区的各个地方，都准许互相流通，所有税收及公私款项，冀钞边钞都一律通用。
    二、冀南银行钞票与晋察冀边区银行钞票的比价，固定为一比十，以后不再变动。就是冀钞一元与边钞十元等价。在两区任何地方所有税收及公私款项，一律按这个比价流通收付，任何人不得改变。
    三、今后两区货币，就按上述比价流通，不论公私民商，如果有买卖货币、捣乱金融、垄断物资的行为，一经查获，决给以严厉处分。
