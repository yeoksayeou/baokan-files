Shouyang Organizes Armed Struggle
	Border Area Masses Return Home for Spring Plowing
	[This newspaper's dispatch] Under the principle of "the enemy advances, we advance; the enemy doesn't advance, we also advance," Shouyang's Fourth District (Niu Huang Kou), Fifth District (Wu Qing Nao), and Bi Shi Village, first organized cadres, militia, and youth to return to their villages armed. After establishing sentry posts and intelligence networks, they gradually mobilized the masses to return home for production. Within seven days, everyone had returned and begun production, quickly eliminating the "no-man's land." The following methods were discussed for armed protection of spring plowing: 1. Each village established a command post, with a main cadre on duty daily, in charge of intelligence and sentry posts. If enemy activity is discovered, they immediately notify each village to lead the masses to quickly evacuate, while the militia use signals to coordinate and concentrate their attacks, covering the retreat of the masses. 2. Observation posts were set up on the high ground in each village, using agreed-upon symbols to report information and maintain communication with each other. The masses are informed of any news at any time to stabilize their production morale. At night, an armed cadre is responsible for leading the militia, combined with landmines, to conduct mobile patrols, avoiding enemy attacks and encirclements. 3. Strengthen the sentry posts to check pedestrians, strictly preventing enemy agents and spies. 4. Transform the terrain, setting up hidden obstacles on major and minor roads, such as thorny branches or road closures. (Shouyang Xiaobao [Small Newspaper])

　　寿阳组织武装斗争
  　边地群众回家春耕
    【本报消息】寿阳在贯彻敌进我进敌不进我也进的方针下，四区牛黄口、五顷垴、碧石村，首由干部民兵青年组织起来，武装回村，建立岗哨情报后，逐渐动员群众回家生产，七天内已完全回去开始生产，这样很快消灭了无人区。并对武装保卫春耕，讨论了以下几种办法：一、各个村庄建立指挥部，每日有一个主要干部值日，掌握情报岗哨，如发现敌情，马上通知各村带领群众迅速转移，民兵则以信号联络，集中出击，掩护群众退却。二、各村高地设立了望哨，订记号，报告消息，互相连络。得到消息后，随时告诉群众，以安定群众生产情绪。夜间由一个武装干部负责，带领民兵结合地雷放游动哨，避免敌人袭击包围。三、加强岗哨盘查行人，严防敌探奸细。四、改造地形，在大小路上暗设障碍，如圪针树叶或断道封锁道路。（寿阳小报）
