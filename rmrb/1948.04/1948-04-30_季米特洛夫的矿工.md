　　Dimitrov's Miners

　　Seventy Chinese miles southeast of Sofia lies a hilly region. Here is a coal mine with a population of 14,000. In 1906, Comrade Dimitrov organized the miners' union here, so the miners of Palnik proudly say, "We are Dimitrov's miners." They have been fighting for more than forty years. Of course, before that year, they had long suffered cruel oppression. It is said that their lives were similar to those of workers in the Kuomintang areas of China, living an inhuman existence, but now they are liberated. They are very happy to recall the past suffering under their new life. The car passed by the Sofia Workers' Sanatorium, following the sprawling mountain road, raising dust, and heading towards the rising sun. As they slowly recounted their stories, a tragic picture of workers in the Chiang-controlled areas suffering from hunger, cold, terror, imprisonment, slaughter, and inhuman existence flashed in my mind.

　　Suddenly, the car stopped in front of a door surrounded by lilac trees. A group of strong men with smiling faces walked out from the red building under the weeping willows. One strong old man in his fifties or sixties extended his big hand and embraced me tightly, kissing me. These were the people in charge of the Palnik coal mine's union.

　　In their reception room, we freely exchanged greetings about the lives and struggles of miners. The old chairman took an old photograph from the wall, showing a row of thin-faced but mentally alert miners. The old chairman told us with a smile that the young man in the middle was Comrade Dimitrov, and the one next to him was himself. This was a treasure he had kept for forty-one years, a souvenir of the founding of the union. During the war against fascism, every time they thought about being Dimitrov's miners, they would immediately gain infinite courage. Now, in the land led by their Elder Brother Dimitrov, they have gained a happy and free life.

　　After national liberation, in order to solve the coal shortage, all the staff and workers made great self-sacrifices and desperately increased production. After two years of hard work, the people's factories gradually recovered, the amount of coal production greatly increased, and the lives of the workers were also improved. They now have an eight-hour working day. Workers participate in the management of production. Coal production is not for capitalists to make money, but for their own country and people. They do not live as the miners of Tangshan in our country used to, with two hundred people taking turns sleeping on seventy rows of wooden bunks. Instead, half of them live in their own homes, and half live in the workshops. The workshops are four-story buildings, with four people in a room, covered with blankets and white sheets, facing the weeping willows, listening to the radio broadcasts. Those miners who live at home are picked up and dropped off by large buses. Their wages are at least 500 leva per day. Each week, they are also provided with one kilogram of vegetable oil, worth 160 leva, one kilogram of butter, worth 400 leva, eleven eggs, and one pound of meat, in addition to unlimited vegetables. And the price that workers pay for each meal is only 50 leva. So, one day's wages can buy ten very good meals. The mine provides each worker with a set of work clothes, a set of everyday clothes, two pairs of shoes, and two sets of shirts and trousers every year. Coal miners receive even better treatment, with one free meal out of two meals a day. Those working above ground can get 15,000 leva per month, and those working underground can get 20,000 leva per month.

　　The union runs three kindergartens and a large hospital. Including the family members of the workers, there is one doctor for every thousand people. The first floor of their workshop is a large club, with books, schools, wall newspapers, drama, music, and movies. The workers have organized drama troupes, concerts, singing groups, football teams, volleyball teams, swimming teams, ski teams, boxing groups, and dance parties. Every night, broadcasts are sent out with music, news, and information about the mine, and all the workshops can receive them.

　　For those working underground, fire prevention and danger prevention are not only insured after the fact, but also special attention is paid to preventive work such as pressing air ducts and building sheds. All medical expenses are covered by the factory. Workers who have worked for fifteen years or are old can retire completely and receive a pension. Workers who are injured or sick on the job receive their wages as usual. The children of workers are subsidized by the state. One child receives 300 leva per month, two receive 700 leva, and three receive 1,200, and so on. These insurance funds are entirely the responsibility of the state. Each month, 7.2 percent of the total wages of the workers is taken out of the wages and handed over to the insurance committee for responsible allocation.

　　The workers' lives are free and happy. The workers are excited to carry out production competitions. Before the war, the average output per worker, including both above and below ground, was 0.75 tons, but now it has reached an average of one ton. Many labor heroes have emerged.

　　The union here is very modest, and they ask us to provide opinions. Fearing that we would not understand their reports, they turned around and took us to the workshops, hospitals, nurseries, canteens, and all the places. Indeed, the living materials we saw were much richer than what they had said. For example, the east side of the union is a place for workers to rest.

　　The weeping willow branches brush the ground, and a yellow sand road is laid out in the middle. Walking to the depths of the willow shade, you can see a row of vermilion railings from afar. Below is a clear green stream, and lotus flowers are in full bloom on the water. Ducks swim freely in pairs under the lotus leaves. Next to it is a delicate small hotel, where young girls are serving tourists. In front of the hotel is a yellow sand slope with exotic flowers blooming, and a unique electric light hangs from an iron pillar in the middle, extending to the top of the willow trees. Every night, young men and women sing and dance to their heart's content in this open-air dance floor.

　　"Is this the life of a miner?" I don't believe it, I'm doubting it. But who else is here besides the miners? Imperialists? Landlords? Fascists? None of them exist anymore. Only Dimitrov's miners enjoy this happiness. Because the workers have gained a good life, they must work harder to increase production. At their miners' conference, I talked about the miners in our liberated areas. For the prosperity of the new democratic economy, we are competing to improve production efficiency, improve quality, and reduce costs. A large number of labor heroes have emerged who are active in their work, diligent in their studies, creative, and willing to help others. The whole audience shouted: "Learn from the workers in the liberated areas of China!"

　　Thousands of miners crowded the large miners' farm. They cheered and applauded. I don't understand what they are saying, I only understand two names: Mao Zedong - Dimitrov. I was moved by this enthusiasm, and my heart emitted a high degree of heat, like a fire burning. I also told the miner brothers about the oppression suffered by the miners in the Kuomintang area, and about the miners in the liberated area who are fighting a bloody battle against Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism for China's independence, peace, democracy, and the complete liberation of the workers. The chairman said to his brothers in a grand tone:

　　"We must protest against Chiang Kai-shek's killing of Chinese miners."

　　"We must follow the example of the workers in the liberated areas of China and strive for independence, peace, democracy, and the construction of the people!"

　　"Down with the American running dog Chiang Kai-shek!"

　　"Down with American imperialism!"

　　"Long live the liberation of China!"

　　October 27, 1947, in London.

    季米特洛夫的矿工
    向索非亚的东南走七十华里的路程，是一个山岗地带。这里有一个一万四千人的煤矿。一九○六年季米特洛夫同志就在这里把矿工工会组织起来，所以这里帕尔尼克的矿工都自己骄傲的说：“我们是季米特洛夫的矿工”。算来已经奋斗四十多年了。当然在那年以前，他们早就遭受残酷的压迫了。据说：那是和中国的国民党区域的工人生活差不多，过着非人的生活，而今得到解放了。他们很欢喜在新的生活下追述着过去的痛苦。汽车经过索非亚工人休养所的旁边，顺着蔓延的山道，扬着灰尘，迎着朝阳驶去。在他们慢慢的讲述中，我的脑海里猛然忆起了蒋管区工人受饥寒、恐怖、监狱、屠杀、非人生活的一幅悲惨的图画来。
    突然车子停在一个丁香树围绕的门前。那垂杨柳下红楼的前面走来了一群体格强壮的男子，满脸的笑容。其中一个五六十岁的强壮老人，伸出了他的大手和我紧紧的拥抱，接吻。这是帕尔尼克的煤矿工会负责的人们。
    到了他们的会客厅里，自由的寒喧起彼此矿工的生活和斗争。老主席从墙上取下了一张古旧的照片，上面是一排面容瘦削而精神敏锐的矿工。老主席含笑的告诉我们，那中间一位青年就是季米特洛夫同志，旁边一位就是他自己。这是他藏了四十一年的一张工会成立纪念的宝贝。当和法西斯战争的时候，每一想到他们是季米特洛夫的矿工，就立刻会增加无限的勇气。现在他们在他们的季大哥领导的国土上，得到了幸福的自由的生活。
    当民族解放后，为了解决煤荒问题，全体职工作了极大的自我牺牲，拼命生产。经过了两年努力，人民的工厂逐渐恢复了，煤的生产数量大大提高了，工人的生活也得到改善了。他们每天是八小时工作制。工人参加了管理生产。煤的生产不是为资本家赚钱，而是为自己的国家人民。他们住的地方，不是从前象我国唐山的矿工，两百人轮流睡在七十个平排的木板铺位上，而是一半住在自己的家庭里，一半住在工房里。工房是四层的楼房，四个人一间房，铺着毯子，盖着雪白的被单，面对着垂柳，听着无线电的广播。那些在家里的矿工，上下班用大汽车接送。工资每天至少可得五百拉瓦，每礼拜伙食除面包以外，还配给一公斤菜油，合一百六十拉瓦，一公斤奶油，合四百拉瓦，十一个鸡蛋，一磅肉，青菜是无限制的。而每餐工人所付的价钱仅五十拉瓦。所以一天的工资，可以吃十顿很好的饭。矿上每年发给一套工衣，一套日常衣服，两双鞋，两套衬衣裤。对于挖煤工人更优待，每日两餐中有一餐免费。在地上工作的，每月可得一万五千拉瓦，在地下工作的每月可得二万拉瓦。
    工会办了三个幼稚园，一个大的医院。连工人家属人口计算在内，每一千人有位医生，他们的工房下面一层是一个大的俱乐部，有图书、学校、壁报、戏剧、音乐、电影。工人组织了剧团、音乐会、歌咏团、足球队、排球队、游泳队、滑雪队、拳术团、和跳舞会。每到晚上有广播播送音乐、新闻和本矿的情形，各处工房都可以收听。
    在地下工作的，防火、防危险，不但有了事后的保险，而且特别注意到按风筒、搭棚子的预防工作。一切医药由厂方负责。工人工作十五年及年老了，可以完全不作工拿养老金。工人因工受伤、疾病歇工的，工资照付。工人的小孩由国家津贴。一个小孩每月三百拉瓦，两个的七百拉瓦，三个的一千二，如此累进。这些保险金完全由国家负责。每月按照工人工资的总数百分之七点二，在工资以外拿出这一笔款子交与保险委员会负责支配。
    工人的生活自由了，幸福了。工人兴奋的进行生产竞赛。战前每一工人连井上井下平均产量○点七五吨，现在已达到平均一吨了。涌现出很多劳动英雄。
    这里的工会十分虚心，他们要求我们提供意见。惟恐我们不了解他们的报导，回头引我们到了工房、医院、托儿所、食堂一切的地方。的确，我们见到的活的材料，比较他们讲的丰富得多。比如说，工会的东面是为工人设备的一个休息的地方。
    柳树的垂条拂在地面，中间平铺着一条黄沙大路。走到柳荫的深处，远看一排朱红的栏杆，下面就是一条碧绿的小溪，水上正是盛开的莲花，鸭子一双双一对对的在荷叶下自由的游泳。旁边一个玲珑的小酒店，年青的姑娘在招待着游客。酒店的前面就是一个奇花盛放的黄沙坡，中间一个铁柱，上面垂下别致的电灯，伸到柳树的梢头。每到夜晚，青年男女在这里露天舞场上尽情歌舞。
    “这是矿工的生活吗？”我不相信，我在怀疑。但是这里除了矿工，又有什么人呢？帝国主义吗？地主吗？法西斯吗？都不存在了。这个幸福只有季米特洛夫的矿工享受了。正由于工人得到了好的生活，更要拼命努力生产。我在他们的矿工大会上，讲到了我们解放区的矿工。为了新民主经济的繁荣，我们正为着提高生产效率，提高质量，减低成本而竞赛。产生了大批的工作积极、学习努力、有创造能力肯帮助别人的劳动英雄。全场大呼：“向中国解放区工人看齐！”
    矿工大农场上千千万万的矿工拥挤着。他们欢呼鼓掌。我不懂得他们讲些什么，只懂的其中两个名字：毛泽东——季米特洛夫。我受到这些热情的激动，我的心发出了一股高度的热，有如火燃。又向矿工弟兄讲述了国民党区矿工所受的压迫，讲述解放区矿工为了中国的独立和平民主，为了工人的彻底解放，在对蒋介石和美帝国主义作流血的斗争。主席以宏大的声调向他的弟兄们说：
    “我们要抗议蒋介石残杀中国的矿工”。
    “我们要效法中国解放区工人，为独立和平民主和人民的建设而努力！”
    “打倒美国的走狗蒋介石！”
    “打倒美帝国主义！”
    “中国解放万岁！”
      一九四七年十月二十七日于伦敦。
