　　Miaozhuang Village in Yuanshi Finds Ways to Overcome the Famine
　　Planting More Barley and Peas to Prepare for an Earlier Harvest
    [Yuanshi News] Miaozhuang Village in the Sixth District of Yuanshi County had a poor harvest last year, coupled with enemy and puppet oppression and extortion, resulting in a severe famine. The village has a total of 103 households, with 633 men and women. Currently, 45 households, with 187 men and women, have no grain, and more than 30 households will not have enough to eat until the wheat harvest. After the disaster relief work team came to the village to understand the situation, they provided a loan of 1,440 catties of grain, 526,000 yuan, and organized the production of bran and vegetables to overcome the famine. The village has 120 spinning wheels. After receiving the grain and loan, their enthusiasm increased, and each wheel increased by two liang per day. Nineteen weaving machines were also organized, and 18 men were organized to transport grain, cloth, and sell vegetables. The masses proposed that famine relief and production should not be delayed. All the land has been cultivated, and more than 100 mu of barley and peas have been planted, preparing for an earlier harvest.　　　　　　　　　　　(Fan Du, Zifeng)
