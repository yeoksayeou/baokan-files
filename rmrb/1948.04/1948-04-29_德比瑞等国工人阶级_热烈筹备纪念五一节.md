Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 26th: Reports from various sources: The working class in Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland are enthusiastically preparing to commemorate May Day. The Central Secretariat of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany recently issued a May Day appeal to the working people in urban and rural areas, pointing out: "Three years have passed since the collapse of the Hitler regime, but a peace treaty has not yet been signed." "The gold-dollar imperialists have formulated plans to split and enslave Germany. We must take countermeasures and demand a national referendum on the issue of German reunification. We are determined to express our indomitable will on May Day and struggle to achieve the goals of the German People's Congress for reunification and a just peace." The statement denounced the Western occupation zones of Germany for "following the path of fascism and war, hindering the people from building a democratic country." But it praised the democratic system in the Soviet occupation zone, saying "The basic goals of the German people in the Eastern occupation zone are: more production, fair distribution, and a comfortable life." This stands in sharp contrast to the fact that the people in the Western occupation zone are still suffering from hunger and poverty. In conclusion, the statement called on the German people to fight "for a democratic and unified Germany, against the plans of reactionaries and foreign monopoly capitalists to enslave Germany." Workers in major cities in Belgium decided to hold large-scale demonstrations on May Day, putting forward the following slogans: Fight for peace, bread, and democracy; fight for the strong unity of the working class and democratic forces. Swedish workers have also decided to hold parades on the holiday.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 26th: Bucharest dispatch: Workers and peasants throughout Romania are launching a production competition to welcome "May Day." The appeal of the Varia Gallas coal mine workers to commemorate "May Day" by exceeding the production plan has been met with resounding responses from workers in various industries. Farmers are also determined to commemorate "May Day" by successfully completing the spring plowing. As of the 18th of this month, 3.37 million hectares of land have been sown. The sowing of some grains has exceeded the plan. Currently, 6,000 tractors are working in the fields, and 87,000 hectares of wheat have been planted in the past week alone.

    德比瑞等国工人阶级
    热烈筹备纪念五一节
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】各方讯：德、比、瑞工人阶级热烈筹备纪念五一节。德国统一社会党中央书记处顷发表五一节对城乡劳动人民的号召，指出：“希特勒政权崩溃已及三年，而和约迄今未签订。”“金元帝国主义制订了分裂及奴役德国的计划，我们要采取对抗的措施，要求全民复决德国统一问题，我们决在五一节日表示我们不屈的意志，为实现德国人民代表大会争取统一及正义和平的目标而斗争。”该文告痛斥德国西部占区“遵循法西斯主义与战争的道路，阻碍人民建设民主国家。”但赞扬苏占区的民主制度，说“德国人民在东占区的基本目标是：更多生产，公平分配及小康生活。”这与西占区人民仍惨遭饥饿与贫困恰成尖锐对照。文告在结语中呼吁德人民进行斗争，“争取民主统一的德国，反对反动派及外国独占资本家奴役德国的计划。”比利时各大城市工人决于五一节举行大示威，并提出如下口号：为争取和平、面包、民主而斗争，为工人阶级与民主势力的强固团结而斗争。瑞典工人亦决定于节日举行游行。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】布加勒斯特讯：罗全国工农展开生产竞赛，以迎接“五一”节。瓦里亚·加拉斯煤矿工人以超过生产计划来纪念“五一”的号召，已得到各业工人的响亮回答。农民亦决以顺利完成春耕来纪念“五一”。截至本月十八日止，三百三十七万公顷土地业已播种完毕，某些谷物的播种已超过计划，现六千架拖拉机正在田间耕作，最近一星期内，就种了小麦八万七千公顷。
