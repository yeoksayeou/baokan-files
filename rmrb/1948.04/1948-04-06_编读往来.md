　　Persuade the Masses to Divide Land Where They Have Settled
　　Editor:
　　During the recent land redistribution in Paifang Administrative Village, Taigu, many people from other regions wanted to return to their hometowns to divide land after hearing about the Outline Land Law. According to investigations, 22 households (mostly from Wu'xiang) with 84 people, cultivating 432.5 mu of land, have already returned. In addition, 19 more households were preparing to leave, but they stayed to participate in the redistribution after the staff's propaganda and explanation. The reasons for the large-scale departures are: 1. They believe the burdens in Taigu are heavy. 2. They have a sense of attachment to their hometowns. 3. Locals are xenophobic, and outsiders only have the obligation to provide labor services without political rights. As a result, the area has become land-rich and population-poor, with each able-bodied worker averaging over 30 mu, which affects production here.
　　Additionally, about 240 households (unconfirmed) have returned from Baicun and Zhaiguan Village in Yu'she County. They can't even find housing, and it is difficult to settle them due to the high population density and land scarcity. This will also hinder production. What should be done?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Li Qingquan)
　　Comrade Qingquan:
　　We believe that, without special circumstances, people should generally divide land where they have settled. Especially in situations like Taigu, where there is more land than people, those who have settled there from other regions should be well-educated and persuaded to divide land and establish their homes there. If everyone leaves, as in the above situation, production on both sides will be affected, and it will be difficult for them to settle and divide land themselves. As for those who have already returned, if they have difficulty settling in their hometowns, they can be encouraged to return to Taigu. Their ideological concerns should be addressed and explained. The heavy burdens are because we need to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. If everyone leaves because they are afraid of heavy burdens, we won't be able to defeat the Chiang-Yan bandit gang, and no one will have a peaceful life. The sense of attachment to hometowns is a backward idea from feudal society; now, all peasants are one family, and neither locals nor outsiders should be treated differently. At the same time, the xenophobic mentality of the locals should be well-educated and criticized. Outsiders should be treated fairly and reasonably in all political and economic rights, without any discrimination. Strengthening the unity among peasants will make these specific problems easier to solve. In short, this issue requires patient persuasion and mobilization from leading cadres, and the masses should not be allowed to drift on their own.

　　Should Performers Be Allocated Land?
　　Editor:
　　I have two questions: 1. Should people who weave mats, mend pots, sell food, perform in operas, deal in miscellaneous goods, shave heads, make sieves, etc., who do not rely on agricultural labor, be allocated land? 2. What is meant by "interspersed land"?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Wang Deming, Wang Yuxiang)
　　Comrades Yuxiang and Deming:
　　1. Those you mentioned, such as those who weave mats, mend pots, shave heads (handicraft laborers), or perform in operas (freelancers), and those who sell food (small vendors), if their families are in the countryside, should be allocated land equivalent to that of peasants for themselves and their families, in accordance with Item B of Article 10 of the Outline Land Law. If their occupations are sufficient to cover all or most of their living expenses, the peasant congress or the peasant association committee may, depending on the circumstances, decide not to allocate land or to allocate only a portion of land.
　　2. Land of one village that is interspersed within the land of another village is called interspersed land.

　　Father Dies, Mother Remarries, Leaving Only One Daughter - How to Handle Housing and Property?
　　Editor:
　　Wang Fengxian (female) of Guai'er Town, Sixth District, Zuoquan, is a middle peasant. Her family had three members. Her father passed away, and her mother remarried and left, leaving Fengxian alone. She is only eighteen years old this year and has married Liu Guisuo. Now there is no one at home, but there are still four rooms of a two-story building and eight mu of land. How should it be handled since no one is taking care of it? (Wen Kui, Xian Rong, Suo He)
　　Comrades Wen Kui, etc.:
　　If Wang Fengxian has married Liu Guisuo and obtained a share of land and property in her husband's family, then the abandoned house and land should be handed over to the village peasant association for disposal (it can be treated as property of a childless and heirless household). However, we do not know the situation of Liu Guisuo's family, so we cannot give a specific answer. In short, no matter where Fengxian divides land, she must have a share.
　　　　——Editor

　　How to Handle the Situation Where There is Not Enough Labor to Cultivate the Land?
　　Editor:
　　Liu Chunlou, an unpaid teacher in Xipo Village, Third District, Huguan (new middle peasant), should be allocated some land based on the population and land in his village. However, his younger brother has joined the army, and there is little labor at home, so he is afraid that he will not be able to cultivate the land if it is allocated, which will affect production. If he is not allocated land, his family will be in trouble. How should it be resolved?
　　(Wang Shucheng)
　　Comrade Shucheng:
　　This situation should be handled in accordance with Item C of Article 10 of the Land Law: "Personnel of the People's Liberation Army, democratic governments, and people's organizations who reside in the countryside, their persons and their families, shall be allocated land and property equivalent to that of peasants." If there is a shortage of labor after the land is allocated, the village government should solve the problem through the method of substitute cultivation. If he is financially secure and does not want the land, he can be allocated less land, without necessarily being absolutely equal.

　　编读往来
  说服群众在哪下户就在哪分地编辑同志：
    这次在太谷牌坊行政村平分土地，很多外乡人听到土地法大纲后要回原籍分地，据调查已回去二十二户（大部是武乡人）八十四口人、种地四百三十二亩半，另外还有十九户准备走，在工作员宣传解释后，留在这里参加平分。为什么大批走：一、认为在太谷差务重。二、有一种乡土观念。三、本地人排外，外乡人只有劳动服务的义务，政治上没有权利。而这里则成了地多人稀，每个全劳力平均三十亩强，这里生产就受到影响。
    另外象榆社县白村、翟管村就回去二百四十户（不确），连房子也找不到住，人多地少不好按置，这样生产也不会搞好，应如何办呢？　
　　（李清泉）清泉同志：
    我们认为如果没有什么特殊情况，一般的在哪里下户就在哪里分地，特别象太谷这种地多人少的情况，对于已在那里下户的外乡人，更应该好好教育说服，动员他们就在那里分地按家。因为都走了，如上面的情况，两面生产受影响，其本人按家分地也会有困难。至于已经回去的，假使在原籍按家有困难，可以动员他们仍回太谷。思想上的顾虑应好好解释说服，差务重是因为要打蒋介石、阎锡山。怕差务重都走了，打不垮蒋阎匪帮，到哪里也没安生日子过。乡土观念是封建社会中的落后思想；如今，天下农民是一家，本地户外来户谁也不要外气。同时更要好好教育批评本地户的排外心理，在各种政治经济权利上对外来户应公平合理，不能稍有歧视。加强了农民间的团结，这些具体问题就好解决了。总之，这问题需要领导干部的耐心说服与动员，不能听任群众自流。

    编席的唱戏的是否应分地？编辑同志：
    我有两个问题：一、编席的、锯锅的、卖饭的、唱戏的干杂货生意的、剃头的、张箩的等等，也不靠农业劳动，给他分地不分？二、啥地叫插花地？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（王德明、王玉相）玉相、德明同志：
    一、你们说的这些编席的、锯锅的、剃头的（手工业劳动者）、或唱戏的（自由职业者）、及卖饭的（小商贩），如家在乡村，应按照土地法大纲第十条乙项的规定，其本人和家庭分给与农民同样的土地。假若他们的职业足以维持全部或大部生活费用的，由农民大会或农会委员会酌量情况，可不分或分给一部分土地。
    二、一个村的土地插在另一村的土地中间的就叫插花地。

    父死母嫁只留一女　房屋财产如何处理编辑同志：
    左权六区拐儿镇王凤仙（女），中农成份，家有三口人，她父去世了，她母改嫁走了，光丢下凤仙一人，今年才十八岁，和刘贵锁结婚了，现在家中无人，但还有楼房四间、地八亩，无人照管该怎样处理？（文魁、显荣、锁和）文魁等同志：
    如果王凤仙已嫁刘贵锁并在丈夫家分得一份土地财产，则这丢下的房屋和土地应交村农会处理（可按绝户地处理）。但不知刘贵锁家情况如何？不能具体作答。总之，不管凤仙在哪里分地，总得有她一份。　
  　——编者
    劳力少怕地种不了如何处理？编辑同志：
    壶关三区西坡村义务教员刘春楼（新中农）家，以他村人口土地来说，还该分些地，可是他弟参军走了，家里劳力少，怕分上种不了，这不是对生产有影响吗？如果不给他分上，他家则是个窟窿，应如何解决？
    （王书成）书成同志：
    这情形应按土地法第十条丙项：“家居乡村的人民解放军、民主政府及人民团体的人员，其本人及其家庭，分给与农民同样的土地及财产”处理。分给地后劳力少时，村政府应按代耕办法解决其困难。如其本人生活有保障确实不愿要，也可少分一些，不一定绝对平均。
