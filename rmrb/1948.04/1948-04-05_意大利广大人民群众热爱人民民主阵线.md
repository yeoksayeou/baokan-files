Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Moscow dispatch: The "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published "Italian Letters" co-written by members of the Soviet youth delegation, Polkoff and Foynova, who had just returned from visiting Italy, vividly describing how the Italian people love the People's Democratic Front and how they hate the American imperialist stooge Gasperi. The letter stated: "We participated in the mass rally held by the People's Democratic Front in Bari. One of the most popular people's leaders, the leader of the General Confederation of Labor, Vittorio, delivered a speech at the meeting. No deception or provocation by the police could suppress the people's love and trust in him. In the hall where thousands of people gathered, slogans like "Long live the victory of the People's Democratic Front!" "Long live Togliatti!" "Long live Vittorio!" echoed everywhere. During a demonstration in Bari, we saw Sherba's (presumably referring to the Interior Minister) police officers scurrying around the streets, while the "Garibaldi Vanguard" youth members, wearing bright red ties, singing revolutionary songs, thundered slogans like "Down with Gasperi!" "Sherba get out!" The "Garibaldi Vanguard" held its founding congress in February, and in just two months, 600,000 young men and women across the country joined. The current task of the vanguard is to ensure the victory of the People's Democratic Front in the upcoming general election. The ranks of the People's Democratic Front are constantly expanding. Many farmers who had joined the Saragat faction, and even a large part of the youth from extreme right-wing parties, have recently joined the front. We left the area full of confidence in the strength of the Italian democratic forces."

　　意大利广大人民群众热爱人民民主阵线
    【新华社陕北三十日电】莫斯科讯：少共真理报发表刚访问意大利归来的苏联青年代表团团员波尔可夫和佛茵诺娃合写的“意大利书简”，生动地描述了意大利人民怎样热爱人民民主阵线，及怎样憎恨美帝走狗加斯贝利。书简内称：“我们参加了人民民主阵线在巴利召开的群众大会，最得人心的人民领袖之一，总工会领袖维特瑞奥曾在会上发表演说。警察的任何欺骗和挑衅，都不能压制人民对他的热爱和信任。在成千人集会的大厅里，到处回响着这样的口号：“人民民主阵线胜利万岁！”“托格里亚蒂万岁！”“维特瑞奥万岁！”在巴利的一次游行示威时，我们看到谢尔巴（按系内长）的警察在街上慌张地奔忙着，而“加黎波的先锋”青年队员打着鲜红的领带，高唱着革命的歌曲，雷鸣着“打倒加斯贝利！”“谢尔巴滚蛋！”等口号，“加黎波的先锋队”在二月召开成立大会后，仅在两个月内，全国已有六十万男女青年参加。该先锋队的当前任务，就是保证人民民主阵线在即将到来的大选中获胜。人民民主阵线的队伍在不断扩大中，很多加入过萨拉盖特派的男女农民，甚至极右派政党青年的一大部分，最近都加入该阵线。我们满怀对意国民主力量强大的信心离别该地。”
