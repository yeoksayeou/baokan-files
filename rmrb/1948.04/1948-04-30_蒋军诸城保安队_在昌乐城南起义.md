Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 28th: During the People's Liberation Army's sweep of the periphery of Chang (Le), Wei (County), and An (Qiu), on the 9th, 171 officers and soldiers of the Jiang Jun Zhucheng Security Brigade, besieged in the Songjiazhuang stronghold south of Changle City, led by Deputy Brigade Commander Zhao Chengxian, carrying 2 machine guns and 126 rifles and pistols, staged an uprising and defected to the People's Liberation Army. The front-line leaders of the People's Liberation Army have ordered that they be rewarded. Furthermore, during our sweeping campaign, combined with political offensives, on the evening of the 10th, when a unit of the People's Liberation Army captured Xujiazhuang northwest of Weicheng, the soldiers climbed the walls and shouted, and all 28 men of the 3rd Platoon of the 2nd Company of the pseudo-Provincial Security 8th Regiment laid down their weapons, handing over 3 light machine guns and 20 rifles. A squad of the pseudo-Provincial Security 6th Regiment's 12th Regiment, entrenched in a protruding bunker on the front line of the North Gate, surrendered after our calls, with soldiers Wang Qingyun and others dragging their guns over. In addition, Jiang Jun soldiers Dong Leshan and others, while escaping from the stronghold, were injured by Jiang bandits' artillery fire, but still insisted on running to the People's Liberation Army's position. Many of the Jiang Jun soldiers who came to surrender were local farmers who had been conscripted not long ago and were covered in scabies due to the harsh living conditions. They have now safely arrived in the rear of the liberated area and have been warmly welcomed and well-treated by our military and civilians along the way.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 28th: The powerful corps of the People's Liberation Army broke through the North Gate and Southwest Gate of Weixian City. On the 11th and 12th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army successively captured the Yujiazhuang and Kangjiazhuang iron bridges near the South Gate of Weicheng, and the Zhangjiazhuang, Youfang Street, and Beigong near the North Gate. On the 14th, another unit of the People's Liberation Army captured the South Camp, the southern barrier of Weixian City. On the 15th, after destroying the Jiang bandits' strong fortifications and stubborn resistance, they entered the North Gate of Weicheng. On the same day, another unit of the People's Liberation Army recovered Fengtai Mountain and Xinglong Mountain, 20 miles south of Fangzi, and successively captured important bandit strongholds such as the Wudaomiao south of the Southwest Gate. On the 16th, they completely captured the Southwest Gate of Weicheng, and most of the defending bandits were annihilated. A total of 5,189 bandits, including a part of the 45th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army and local security teams, were annihilated from the 2nd to the 20th.
