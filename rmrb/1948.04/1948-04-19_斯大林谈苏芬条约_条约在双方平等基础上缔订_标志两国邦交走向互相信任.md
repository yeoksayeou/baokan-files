Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, Moscow, 12th: At a banquet on the 7th in honor of the Finnish government delegation, Stalin delivered the following speech: "I would like to say a few words about the significance of the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance signed yesterday. This treaty marks a turning point in the relations between our two countries. As everyone knows, for 150 years, the characteristic of relations between our two countries has been mutual distrust. Russians distrusted Finns, and Finns distrusted Russians. The Soviet side previously attempted to break the distrust between the Soviet Union and Finland, which occurred in 1917 when Lenin declared Finland's independence. From a historical perspective, this was a remarkable action. However, unfortunately, this action still failed to break the distrust. As a result, we had two wars between us. My wish is that we should move from a stage of prolonged mutual distrust to a new stage in our relations – a stage of mutual trust. The treaty we have concluded should break this distrust and create a new foundation for the relations between our two peoples. It should also mark an important turning point in the relations between our two countries towards trust and friendship. We hope that this treaty will be deeply understood not only by those present but also by those in Finland and the Soviet Union who are not present. We cannot assume that distrust between the two countries can be eliminated immediately; this cannot be accomplished quickly. The remnants and traces of distrust persist for a long time. In order to eliminate them, we should work more and struggle more to create a tradition of friendship between the Soviet Union and Finland that is lasting and enduring. There are equal treaties and unequal treaties. Because the Soviet-Finnish treaty was concluded on the basis of complete equality between the two contracting parties, it is an equal treaty. Many people do not believe that relations between a large country and a small country can be equal. But we, the Soviet people, firmly believe that such relations can and will exist. The Soviet people firmly believe that every country, regardless of its size, has its own characteristics that belong only to it and are not possessed by other countries. These characteristics are each country's contribution to the common wealth of world culture, a contribution that supplements and enriches it. In this sense, all countries, regardless of size, are on an equal footing, and each country is equal to other countries. Therefore, the Soviet people firmly believe that although Finland is a small country, it is equal to the Soviet Union in this treaty. Among the great powers, there are not many politicians who regard small countries as equal to great powers. Most of them are condescending and despise small countries. Sometimes they do not object to making unilateral guarantees to small countries. But in general, these politicians do not agree to conclude equal treaties with small countries because they do not regard small countries as their partners. For the Finnish treaty, for the improvement in relations between the two countries marked by this treaty, I ask everyone to raise a glass."

　　斯大林谈苏芬条约
    条约在双方平等基础上缔订
    标志两国邦交走向互相信任
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科十二日电：斯大林在七日宴请芬政府代表团的宴会上，发表讲演如下：“我愿意就苏芬昨日所签订的友好互助条约的意义说几句话。这个条约标志着两国邦交的转捩点。大家知道，一百五十年以来，两国邦交的特点便是互不信任。俄罗斯人不信任芬兰人，而芬兰人也不信任俄罗斯人。苏方过去曾试图打破苏芬间的不信任，这是一九一七年列宁宣布芬兰独立时所发生的事。从历史的观点看来，这是个卓绝的行动。然而不幸，这一行动仍未能打破不信任。结果，我们之间发生了两次战争。我的愿望是：我们应从长久互相不信任的阶段，转上我们邦交的新阶段——互相信任的阶段。我们已缔结的条约应当打破这一不信任，为我们两国人民的关系创立新基础，它也应标志着两国邦交走向信任与友好的重要转捩点。我们盼望这个条约不仅被在座各位，而且也被芬苏两国未在座的人们深切了解。我们不能认为两国间的不信任能即时消除，这是不能迅速完成的。不信任的残余和痕迹长期存在，我们为了消除它们，便应多作工作，多作斗争来造成苏芬两国间彼此友好的传统，使之持久长存。条约有平等的，有不平等的。因为苏芬条约是在缔约国双方完全平等的基础上缔订的，所以它是平等条约。许多人不相信大国与小国间的邦交能够平等。但是我们苏维埃人民坚认：这种邦交能够而且定将存在。苏维埃人民坚认：每一国家，不论其大小，都有它自己的、只属于它而为别国所没有的特征。这些特征便是每一国对世界文化共同财富的贡献，补充并使其丰富起来的贡献。在这意义上，一切国家不论大小都处于同等地位，而且每一国家都与其他国家相等。因此，苏维埃人民坚认：虽然芬兰是小国，它在这条约中是与苏联平等的。在大国中，要找出把小国看成与大国平等的政治家是不多的。他们大多数居高临下，蔑视小国。有时他们也并不反对对小国作片面的保证。但一般说来，这些政治家因为不把小国当作他们的同伴看待，所以不同意与小国缔结平等条约。为了芬兰条约，为了这一条约所标志的两国邦交的好转，我请各位干杯。”
