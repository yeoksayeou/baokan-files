Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: The Shandong Provincial Democratic Government is using work relief to overcome the serious spring famine caused by Chiang Kai-shek bandits last year. The first batch of grain transported by disaster victims, organized by the Provincial Grain Bureau, has already reached several tens of thousands of catties. Transporters receive thirteen catties for every hundred catties per hundred li. During the transportation period, the Bureau still issued three catties of coarse grain per day as rations, despite a three-day suspension due to rain. The Sixth Sub-bureau of Industry and Commerce in Luzhong transported 60,000 catties of salt, of which more than 50,000 catties have been transported in three batches. The lives of the two thousand disaster victims participating in the salt transport have been partially supplemented, and the market supply of salt has been adjusted. Disaster victims in Yizhong County earned 15,000 yuan (Beihai currency, same below) for transporting cotton to Bohai for every hundred catties per hundred li. The first batch earned more than 60 million yuan in wages, netting more than 33 million yuan after deducting food expenses, which can buy more than 36,000 catties of coarse grain at market prices. Hao Quanxiang from Xiaojiagou can buy more than 480 catties of grain after deducting travel expenses. The Provincial Highway Bureau is building highways, and the section completed just before March alone distributed more than 10,000 catties of work-relief grain. The Provincial Government's water conservancy survey in the Binbei area has now been completed and is organizing disaster victims to start work.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: After the recovery of Zichuan, the Democratic Government immediately carried out post-war work such as treating wounded masses and prisoners, burying corpses, and repatriating prisoners. The government established a special medical team to treat the masses injured by Chiang Kai-shek bandits and stray bullets on the five main streets of the urban area. Within three days, all eighty-four wounded people received bandages and treatment. After the medical treatment of more than seven hundred and forty wounded prisoners collected after the war, three hundred and thirty lightly wounded people were given travel expenses and sent back to their homes. While the prisoners of war were being treated and discharged, they were deeply moved to hear that the "Outline Land Law of China" promulgated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulated that "family members of Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers will also be given a share of land."

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 8th: A reporter from this agency reported on the strangulation of industry and commerce in Zhangdian City by Chiang Kai-shek bandits, saying that the city had once prospered after its liberation last year. For example, the Yongji Alkali Factory on Guangping Road was loaned 300,000 Beihai yuan by the Democratic Government at that time. In addition to repaying the principal and interest within three months, it also obtained ample working capital. However, on the sixth day after Chiang Kai-shek bandits invaded Zhangdian last autumn, the factory was forced to close down on the false charge that the source of alkali powder was unknown, and even the large pot for boiling alkali was sold. Chiang Kai-shek bandits frantically apportioned and levied extremely high taxes. Businesses such as Yifeng Sauce Garden and Tianhe Hall had to pay various exorbitant taxes of four to five million Chiang Kai-shek yuan per month. Sanxing Department Store on Erma Road had to pay 200 catties of wheat per month for the storefront alone. Shops were forced to close down one after another. The new market, which the Democratic Government had loaned more than one million yuan (Beihai currency) to repair and restore, was ordered by Chiang Kai-shek bandits to pay 20 Chiang Kai-shek yuan for every yuan borrowed. The more than one hundred and twenty stalls in the new market also had to pay more than 7,000 catties of millet per month, so the market vendors were also devastated. For example, a Yue, who ran a steamed bun shop, said: Chiang Kai-shek bandits demanded 200,000 from me once, and 270,000 the second time, and the two times wiped out my steamed bun shop.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: The masses in Linzi and Huantai, newly recovered areas of the Jiaoji Railway line, have successively accused Chiang Kai-shek bandits of their heinous crimes. Xu Zhenzhong, the pseudo-county chief of Linzi, shot and buried more than two hundred and fifty people alive outside Beigezi in Xiguan, and demolished a large number of civilian houses to build city wall fortifications, demolishing more than one thousand houses in Chengguan Town alone. A fourteen-year-old girl in Zhao Wangzhuang was continuously raped by Xu bandits for three days. A platoon leader of Xu's troops led four bandits and raped women in broad daylight at the Nanguan market. Xu bandits extorted more than 600 catties of fine grain every six months for every two fields of land tax, and his slogan was: "Buckwheat skin can still squeeze two liang of oil, disobey and cut it open to cool it (i.e., beheading)." Among the twelve households in Beijie, Xiguan, seven households have run out of food due to the grain being looted. Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Huantai massacred more than fifty people in nineteen villages including Gaolou, and forcibly arrested more than four hundred young people in Shanghanjia Village, forcing each person to pay three to six shi of wheat to redeem their lives. Chai Keqing, the pseudo-county chief, colluded with landlords to "reverse the settlement" with the emancipated peasants, killing peasant Yin Chengye from Gaolou, driving away his wife and children, and forcing Qiu Zhenting, a peasant from Maojiazhuang, to sell two of his own daughters to pay off debts. Now that the masses have seen the light of day again, they are asking the People's Liberation Army to avenge them when they see them.

　　山东民主政府以工代赈
  　克服蒋造严重春荒
    张店市场全被蒋匪绞杀
    【新华社华东七日电】山东省民主政府以工代赈，克服去年蒋匪造成之严重春荒。现省粮食总局组织之灾民运粮，第一批已运若干万斤。运输者每百斤百里提成十三斤，运输期间因雨停运三日，总局仍照日发口粮三斤粗粮。鲁中工商六分局运盐六万斤，其中五万多斤已分三批运达，参加运盐的两千灾民生活得到部分补足，并调剂了市场食盐。沂中县灾民到渤海运棉每百斤百里得工资一万五千元（北海币，下同），第一批共赚工资六千余万元，除伙食外净赚三千三百多万元，按市价可买粗粮三万六千多斤。肖家沟郝全祥除路费外，能买粮四百八十多斤。省公路局兴修公路，仅三月前完成的一段，就发了工赈粮一万多斤，省政府在滨北地区之水利测量现已进行完毕，正组织灾民动工中。
    【新华社华东七日电】淄川收复后，民主政府立即进行治疗负伤群众与俘虏和掩埋遗尸，遣送俘虏等善后工作。政府成立专门医治小组，分头进行医救城区五条大街为蒋匪及流弹伤害的群众，三天内八十四名负伤者均得到包扎治疗。战后收容之七百四十余名伤俘，经医疗后，其中三百三十名轻彩号，即陆续发给路费，遣送返籍。战俘在医治遣散中，听到中共中央颁布之“中国土地法大纲”中有“蒋军官兵家属也分给一份土地”的规定，都异常感动。
    【新华社华东八日电】分社记者报导张店市工商业被蒋匪绞杀情形称：去年该市解放后曾一度趋向繁荣。如广平路永记碱厂，当时民主政府曾贷给北海币三十万元，三个月除归还本息外，并获宽裕的周转资金。但去秋蒋匪侵陷张店后第六天，该厂即被诬以碱粉来历不明被迫关门，连熬碱大锅也卖了。蒋匪疯狂摊派，苛杂极多。益丰酱园、天合堂商号等家每月缴纳各项苛杂达四、五百万元蒋币。二马路三兴百货商店只门面每月就要缴纳二百斤麦子的捐税。商店被迫纷纷停业。民主政府曾贷款百多万元（北海币）修盖恢复起来的新市场，蒋匪勒令贷款户每贷得一元者，须缴纳蒋币二十元；新市场一百二十多家摊贩，每月尚须缴小米七千多斤，因之该市场商贩也被摧残殆尽。如一个开馒头铺的岳某说：蒋匪一次要我二十万，第二次要我二十七万，两次就把我的馒头铺一锅端了。
    【新华社华东七日电】胶济线新收复区临淄、桓台群众，纷纷控诉蒋匪滔天罪行。临淄伪县长徐振中，曾在西关北阁子外枪杀活埋群众二百五十多名，并拆毁大批民房修筑城垣工事，仅城关镇就被拆掉一千多间。赵王庄一个十四岁闺女被徐匪连续强奸三天。徐匪部属排长带匪徒四名，竟大白天在南关大集上强奸妇女。徐匪勒索每两田赋半年交细粮六百多斤，其口号是：“荞麦皮还挤二两油，违抗切开凉着（即砍头）。”西关北街十二户居民中因粮食被搜刮，有七户已断粮。桓台蒋匪在高楼等十九个村曾惨杀群众五十多名，并在上韩家村强抓青年四百多名，威逼每人出麦子三石到六石赎命。伪县长柴克清勾结地主向翻身农民“倒算”，杀死高楼农民尹成业，将其妻和子赶走，并强迫毛家庄农民邱振亭卖掉二个亲生女儿抵帐。现在群众重见天日，看到解放军就要求替他们报仇雪恨。
