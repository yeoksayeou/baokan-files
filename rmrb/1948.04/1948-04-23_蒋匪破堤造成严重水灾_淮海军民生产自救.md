　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th—The Huaihai Special Commissioner's Office recently made a preliminary summary of production and disaster relief work, and called for the implementation of production for self-relief. Last July, the area suffered severe flooding due to the breaching of dikes by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. At that time, the Special Commissioner's Office called on the entire district to organize production and widely plant vegetables and buckwheat to solve some of the difficulties. For example, Suqian County harvested 5 million jin of vegetables, 7.2 million jin of grass, caught 230,000 jin of fish, and planted 10,000 mu of buckwheat. However, due to early frost and poor autumn harvests, the disaster situation remained serious. In January of this year, the District Committee issued an emergency disaster relief instruction, established disaster relief committees at all levels, and allocated 400,000 jin of grain for production and disaster relief, and 1.2 million jin of grain for spring farming loans. It was announced that all past agricultural loans would not need to be repaid. Shuyang County alone waived agricultural loans worth 100 million Central China currency. The authorities also organized the masses to transport grain in lieu of work, issuing a total of 1,378,000 jin of wages in grain. The Huaihai Trading Company sold 700,000 jin of grain at a parity price in Donghai, Guanyun, and Muyang counties, which were severely affected by the disaster, and systematically organized the masses to engage in sideline production such as oil extraction, tree felling, charcoal burning, fishing, saltpeter extraction, mat weaving, and transportation. According to statistics at the end of February, more than 218,000 of the 304,700 disaster victims who had run out of food had received relief and participated in production. In Chongfang Village, Suqian, a noodle mill made noodles from 30 shi of black beans in one month, solving the livelihood of more than 300 people. A large number of disaster victims in Guanyun and Donghai counties relied on digging lotus roots to survive, and have dug a total of 13.5 million jin so far. All government offices and schools economized on food and clothing, and donated money and grain for disaster relief. Primary and secondary schools throughout the district donated a total of more than 50,000 jin of grain. Honored veterans of Sishui and Shuyang voluntarily donated their disability pension grain. The masses in Huaiyin, Lianshui, and Sishui counties, where the disaster situation was relatively light, donated a total of 1 million jin of grain.
    In order to further develop the production and disaster relief movement, the District Committee issued another instruction last month, criticizing the shortcomings of underestimating the disaster situation, bureaucratic work style in leadership, and failure to deeply mobilize production and disaster relief. It was decided to temporarily suspend land reform and make production and disaster relief the current central task. It also proposed: (1) Continue to develop production for self-relief and mutual relief. Oppose paralysis, dependence, and timidity. (2) Cadres must conduct in-depth inspections and reflect the disaster situation, help refugees carefully plan and formulate disaster relief plans. Each county should formulate a comprehensive plan to support the sideline production of disaster victims and help solve capital and sales difficulties. (3) The Special Commissioner's Office will issue another 900,000 jin of relief grain and 1 million jin of disaster relief public bond grain. (4) Organize the masses to actively engage in spring plowing and widely plant early-maturing melons and vegetables, so that no acre of land is left uncultivated. Shuyang, Donghai, and Suqian have proposed that each person plant one to three fen of spring vegetables, and Huaiyin has decided to plant a large amount of spring wheat.

　　蒋匪破堤造成严重水灾
  　淮海军民生产自救
    【新华社华东十九日电】淮海专署顷初步总结生产救灾工作，并号召贯彻生产自救。该区去年七月因蒋匪破堤造成水灾，当时专署即号召全分区组织生产，普种青菜、荞麦，解决了部分困难。如宿迁县曾收青菜五百万斤，草七百二十万斤，捕鱼二十三万斤，种下一万亩荞麦，但后因早霜秋田歉收，灾情依然严重。今年一月地委即发出紧急救灾指示，成立各级救灾委员会，并拨发生产救灾粮四十万斤，春耕农贷粮一百二十万斤，宣布过去农贷一律不要归还，仅沭阳一县即免还农贷华中币一亿元，并以工代赈，组织群众运粮，共发工资粮一百三十七万八千斤。淮海贸易公司在灾情严重的东海、灌云、沐阳平粜粮食七十万斤，有计划的组织群众榨油、刨树、烧炭、捕鱼，扫硝、编席、运输等副业生产。据二月底统计：全区三十万四千七百断炊灾民，已有二十一万八千余人获得救济，并参加生产。宿迁冲坊村粉坊一月内以三十石黑豆做成粉条，解决三百余人生活。灌云、东海两县大批灾民靠挖芙子渡日，前后已挖了一千三百五十万斤。各机关学校节衣缩食，献金献粮救灾。全区中小学共献粮五万余斤。泗沭、沭阳荣誉军人自动捐献残废抚恤粮。灾情较轻的淮阴、涟水、泗沭三县群众共献粮一百万斤。
    为进一步开展生产救灾运动，上月地委特再度发出指示，批评了对灾情估计不足，领导上官僚主义作风，没有深入动员生产救灾等缺点，决定暂时停止土改，以生产救灾为当前中心任务。并提出：（一）继续开展生产自救互救。反对麻痹、依赖及畏缩思想。（二）干部必须深入检查与反映灾情，帮助难民精心计划，订出渡灾计划，各县应订出全面计划，扶植灾民副业生产，帮助解决资本与销售困难。（三）专署再度发放救济粮九十万斤，和发放救灾公债粮一百万斤。（四）组织群众积极春耕，普遍种早熟瓜菜，做到不荒一亩地。现沭阳、东海、宿迁已提出每人种一分到三分春菜，淮阴决定大量种春麦。
