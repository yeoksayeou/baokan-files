　　Planting Early is Best in High, Cold Mountains; Houchi Plants 400 Mu of Millet
    [Shexian News] Houchi Village is located in a mountain valley. With high mountains and cold ground, experience over the years shows that planting crops early is better than planting late. Production Director Liu Quanlu is also paying close attention. Out of the village's 1,200 mu of uncultivated land, after reserving land for cotton, hemp, vegetables, beans, and corn, a net of 803 mu is planted with millet. 800 mu have already been plowed, and 412 mu have been planted with millet, and 258 caves planted with pumpkins. There are also potatoes and cotton. Liu Quanhua himself farms 4.2 mu of land. He has no women in his family, so he gets up early to cook, takes dry food at noon without going home, and sends his children to a neighbor's house for lunch and to school. He only returns in the evening. The whole village has 677 people, and 1,800 trees have been planted, exceeding the original plan by nearly two-thirds. Liu Shiji, a 46-year-old honest middle peasant, is very happy after studying the Land Law. He has now built four houses without roofing them and is currently planting spring crops. The cooperative organized the digging of medicinal herbs for five days, earning 252,986 yuan. As soon as the ground dried up, the cooperative stopped buying and called on everyone to plant the land before digging again. Twelve head of livestock transported wood to Cixian, earning more than 100,000 yuan. Women spun 703 jin of thread and wove 186 jin of cloth. Liu Laopeng, a 60-year-old woman from the sixth group, averages half a jin of thread per day (three liang in the evening). The whole village has a great enthusiasm for production.
