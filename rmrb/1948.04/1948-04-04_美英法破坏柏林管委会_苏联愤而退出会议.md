Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Berlin dispatch: At the Allied Control Council meeting on March 20th, due to the US, British, and French occupying authorities refusing to report the true situation of the London Conference regarding the German issue, Soviet Commander Marshal Sokolovsky believed that "the Control Council is in fact no longer the supreme body governing Germany by the four powers, and there is no need to hold this meeting again." Therefore, he angrily withdrew from the meeting. On the 25th, Lieutenant General Luganchenko, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, when answering reporters' inquiries on the matter, pointed out that the US, British, and French occupying authorities had repeatedly violated the Potsdam Agreement and continuously undermined the four-power agreement of the Control Council. Therefore, the Control Council had in fact ceased to perform its duties as the supreme authority. All responsibility for this sabotage should be borne by the US, British, and French occupying authorities. He then declared: Since the establishment of the US-British Joint Zone in the summer of 1946, the US, British, and French occupying authorities have transformed the Control Council from an administrative organ into a discussion organ, which has neither passed important decisions nor guaranteed the implementation of decisions that have been passed. At the same time, the Western occupying zones have independently decided many major issues concerning the interests of all of Germany and directly within the authority of the Control Council. The recent refusal of the US, British, and French commanders to report the decisions of the London Conference shows that the Western occupying powers are unwilling to regard the Control Council as the supreme organ for controlling Germany, and they are afraid to expose the true purpose of the London Conference to the German people and world public opinion. The US, British, and French representatives have turned the Control Council into a smokescreen for their establishment of a West German government and the formation of a Western European bloc. Even now, they want to further restore West Germany as the main force against the cause of peace, using the hands of the Germans to pull chestnuts out of the fire for Western imperialists. Luganchenko strongly stated that the Soviet side has always insisted on implementing the Potsdam Agreement and the Control Council Agreement. However, the Soviet Union cannot tolerate turning the Control Council into a hypocritical existence. Due to the sabotage by the US, Britain, and France, it has lost its function. We strongly advocate retaining a Control Council that conforms to the Potsdam Agreement and the agreement on controlling Germany.

　　美英法破坏柏林管委会
  　苏联愤而退出会议
    【新华社陕北二日电】柏林讯：在三月二十日的盟国管制委员会会议上，由于美、英、法占领当局拒绝报告三国伦敦会议所讨论的德国问题的实情，苏军司令索柯罗夫斯基元帅认为“管委会实际上已不再是四国治理德国的最高机关，没有必要再开这个会议”，因此愤而退出会议。二十五日德境苏军政府参谋长芦干钦科中将，在答复记者就此事所提出的询问时，指出：美、英、法占领当局历次违反波茨顿协定，不停的破坏管委会的四国协定，因此管委会实际上已中止了执行其最高当局的职责，这一切破坏之责任，应由美、英、法占领当局担负。他接着宣称：自一九四六年夏美英联合占区成立以后，美、英、法占领当局将管委会由行政机关变为讨论机关，既未通过重要决定，亦未保证已通过决定之实现。同时，西占区却单独决定许多有关全德利益及直接属于管委会权限之内的重大问题。最近美、英、法司令拒绝报告伦敦会议决定的事实，说明西部占领国不愿将管委会当作管制德国最高机关，而且他们害怕向德国人民及世界舆论暴露伦敦会议的真正目的。美、英、法代表已将管委会变为他们建立西德政府与组成西欧集团的遮眼物。甚至目前他们想进一步恢复西德，作为反对和平事业的主力，利用德国人的手，替西方帝国主义者火中取栗。芦干钦科力称：苏联方面始终坚持执行波茨顿协定及管委会协定。但苏联不能忍受将管委会成为虚伪的存在。由于美、英、法从中破坏使其失却了作用。我们力主保留一个符合于波茨顿协定及管制德国协定的管制委员会。
