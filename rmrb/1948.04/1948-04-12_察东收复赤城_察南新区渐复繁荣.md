Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liao, 10th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local armed forces, recovered Chicheng in eastern Chahar on the 6th, as well as Diaobao east of Longguan. On the night of the 2nd, the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the Fu bandits in Xingrenbao, eight miles south of Chicheng. The next morning, they completely annihilated parts of the enemy's reconnaissance unit of the Chahar Provincial Security Team and the Chicheng Police Team, capturing over 120 prisoners and killing over 40. They seized 80 rifles and two machine guns. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local armed forces, also launched an attack on Diaobao on the 2nd, immediately occupying all the castles in the northern mountains of the stronghold. By noon on the 6th, they had completely annihilated over 300 enemy soldiers from the pseudo-Chahar Provincial Security Team and the Chicheng Police Team, seizing over 300 rifles and nine light machine guns. On the 6th, over 600 Fu bandits and Chicheng Police Team members entrenched at Jianziling, the connecting point of the Longguan-Chicheng highway, were intimidated by the power of our army and fled in panic towards Longguan. Chicheng and Jianziling were immediately recovered by us. By this point, in the vast area between Pingdingbao, Chongli, Longguan, and Yanqing in eastern Chahar, there was no trace of bandits.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Frontline, 7th. In the vast areas of southern Chahar that have been liberated, as our army's offensive progresses, cloth, cotton, and mountain goods from western Hebei have been continuously flowing in. From the 26th of last month to the 2nd of this month, the local bank exchange office has exchanged 7 billion Fu-Chiang currency, and the market is gradually becoming active. The Chahar Provincial Democratic Government has also distributed 2,000 shi of grain to relieve disaster-stricken compatriots. In addition to mobilizing the masses to support the war, the local government has begun to arrange for spring plowing, calling for the organization of mutual aid to overcome difficulties such as livestock and farm tools. The Chahar government has also issued a proclamation announcing that land will not be equally divided in the new district for the time being, calling on farmers in various places to eliminate their wait-and-see attitude and actively engage in the production movement, eliminate wasteland, increase cultivated land, produce more grain, and overcome the severe famine caused by the Fu bandits in southern Chahar.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 7th. The people of Suimeng and Yanbei enthusiastically support the front line, assisting the People's Liberation Army in combat. At the end of March, our army marched north to the Great Wall to attack Liangchengchang, an important stronghold of the Fu bandits. More than 300 farmers from 23 nearby villages spontaneously organized stretcher teams to serve the army. Women ground out more than 30,000 jin of naked oat flour in four days and four nights and sent it to the front. One village was robbed five times by the Fu bandits, leaving them with no food or clothing. Doors and windows were burned, and the masses sheltered in mountain gullies and cold kilns in the wind and snow for more than 40 days. Now they have all happily come out. When our army attacked Liangchengchang, the masses struggled to carry the wounded under fire, and some brought cooked eggs and water bottles to comfort the wounded. Shanyin County established a front-line support committee. The county magistrate and the secretary of the CCP County Committee personally participated in the leadership, deciding that farmers would participate in the war in batches on a rotational basis and adjusting manpower to ensure that production was not delayed.

Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liao, 10th. Under the ravages of the Chiang-Fu bandit gang, the people of Zhangjiakou are living in misery. The Fu bandits sent a large number of secret agents to serve as baojia personnel, constantly monitoring the words and deeds of citizens, and implementing traffic control. Any citizen leaving the area must first hold an "identification card," register with the pseudo-bao public office, and have two shops vouch for them at the bandit police station. Finally, they must be approved by the pseudo-branch and general bureau before they can leave. Those who fail to return after the deadline will have their guarantors detained. The restrictions on the travel of young adults are even stricter. Bandit police frequently used household registration checks as a pretext to extort citizens. A curfew is imposed in the city after 11 p.m. A large number of beggars have nowhere to live in the cold night and are all driven to the riverside, where many freeze to death. Recently, the Fu bandits have forcibly conscripted 3,000 mules and 1,000 horses in the city and stipulated that those who cannot provide mules and horses must pay Chiang currency, which is borne by various merchants and residents. Large merchants were assigned 24 mules, while two small merchants jointly donated one mule. Larger restaurants, butcher shops, and barbershops had to donate at least one horse. Currently, many citizens have been detained for failing to pay this donation. In addition, the Fu bandits' "self-defense fee" is also extremely harsh. Each special-class household must pay 80 jin of millet per month; first-class households pay 60 jin per household; second-class households pay 40 jin per household, and other exorbitant taxes are even more difficult to enumerate.

　　察东收复赤城
  　察南新区渐复繁荣
    【新华社冀察热辽十日电】解放军某部配合地方武装，六日收复察东赤城，及龙关以东之雕堡。二日夜，解放军首对赤城南八里之兴仁堡傅匪发起攻击，次日晨全歼守敌侦察省保安队及赤城保警队各一部，生俘一百二十余名，毙四十余名。缴获步枪八十支、机枪两挺。另部解放军配合地方武装，亦于二日向雕堡发起攻击，当即将该据点北山一带之城堡全部占领，至六日午后，全歼守敌伪察省保安队及赤城保警队三百余名，缴获步枪三百余支，轻机枪九挺。六日，盘踞龙（关）赤（城）公路联络点剪子岭傅匪及赤城保警队六百余名，慑于我军声威，仓惶向龙关撤退，赤城及剪子岭当即为我收复。至此，察东平定堡、崇礼、龙关及延庆间之广大地区内，已无匪踪。
    【新华社晋察冀前线七日电】重获解放的察南广大地区，随着我军攻势进展，冀西布匹、棉花、山货已源源输入。上月二十六日至本月二日该地银行兑换所已兑换傅蒋币七十亿，市场渐形活跃。察省民主政府并已发粮两千石救济受灾同胞。当地政府除发动群众支助作战外，已着手布置春耕，号召组织互助，克服牲畜农具等困难。察府并发出布告，宣布新区暂不实行土地平分，号召各地农民消除观望心理，积极投入生产运动，消灭荒地，增加耕地，多打粮食，战胜傅匪在察南造成的严重灾荒。
    【新华社晋绥七日电】绥蒙及雁北人民热烈支援前线，协助解放军作战，三月底我军北赴长城，进攻凉城厂汉营傅匪重要据点，附近二十三个村庄三百多农民自动组织担架随军服务，妇女在四天四夜内磨出三万多斤莜面，送上前方。某村被厂汉营傅匪抢劫五次，粮食衣物一空，门窗户壁被焚，群众在风雪中避居山沟寒窑四十多天，现在都快乐的走了出来。当我军攻入厂汉营时，群众在火线下争抬伤员，有的带着煮熟的鸡蛋和水壶去慰问伤员。山阴县成立支援前线委员会，县长和中共县委书记，亲自参加领导，决定农民分批轮流参战，并调剂人力使不误生产。
    【新华社冀察热辽十日电】蒋傅匪帮蹂躏下之张家口民不聊生。傅匪派遣大批特务充当保甲人员，随时监视市民言行，并实施通行管制，凡市民出境前须先持“身份证”，向伪保公所登记，并请两家店铺到匪警派出所作保，最后还须经伪分局及总局批准，始能外出，如逾期不归者，则扣押其保人。一般青壮年之外出限制更严，傅匪警察经常借检查户口为名，挨户敲诈市民。夜间十一时后市内即行戒严。大批乞丐寒夜无处栖宿，均被赶到沿河一带，冻死的很多。近来傅匪又在该市强征骡子三千头，马一千匹，并规定拿不出骡马者，折缴蒋币，均由各商家及住户摊派负担；大商家被派骡子二十四头，小商两家合捐一头，较大的饭铺、肉铺、理发馆至少也得捐一匹马，现市民因交不出此项捐款，许多已被扣押。此外，傅匪之“自卫费”亦甚苛重，每月每一特等户，即须交小米八十斤；头等每户交六十斤；二等每户交四十斤，其他苛捐杂税，更难枚举。
