Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 16th: Comprehensive report: Since the solar New Year, the struggle of workers in the Chiang area against hunger and oppression, seeking survival, has spread to large and small cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Nanchang. The employees directly and indirectly involved in the movement include more than forty industries such as textiles, wool weaving, silk weaving, dyeing, knitting, fashion, suits, bedding, department stores, canned food, enamel, flashlights, chemicals, western medicine, matches, cigarettes, finance, banking, broadcasting, printing, water and electricity transportation, coal mines, machinery, shipbuilding, ship locks, ships, customs, piloting, and sailors. Among them, the anti-hunger movements of workers in the textile, transportation, bedding, and customs industries have repeatedly surged, with strikes and slowdowns occurring several times, involving as many as ten thousand people in one factory at a time.

Workers in the Four Great Families' bureaucratic capital and imperialist enterprises, who have suffered cruel oppression and excessive exploitation, have been constantly carrying out heroic resistance since around the solar New Year. Before the New Year, employees of the Chiang bandit Nanjing Jiangnan Bus Company and the Jianghai Customs, controlled by US imperialism, held hunger strikes, slowdowns, and strikes to demand wage increases and year-end bonuses because they could not afford to celebrate the New Year. The labor潮 gradually expanded until the Shanghai Shenxin Textile Factory massacre, owned by the bureaucratic capital Zhongfang Company, reached its climax. More than 6,000 workers (the vast majority of whom were female workers) in the Ninth Factory of the factory began a strike on January 30 to fight for reasonable living conditions and demand a year-end bonus. On February 2, the Shanghai Chiang bandit authorities dispatched military police and secret agents from the entire city, surrounded the factory with tanks, armored vehicles, and motorcycle teams. Chiang bandit Songhu Garrison Commander and executioner Xuan Tiewu openly and bloodily howled: "Kill without question, I will be responsible for everything." Under the personal command of Yu Shuping, the chief of the Shanghai Chiang bandit police bureau, tear gas, American-style machine guns, rifles, and bayonets were used to massacre male and female manual workers, resulting in more than sixty workers being killed or injured on the spot, and more than three hundred were arrested. At that time, the workers bravely defended themselves. Many female workers occupied the roofs of the workshops and fought back against the Chiang family's fascist beasts with iron sheets, bricks, and benches. The labor潮 quickly turned into a struggle against oppression and murderous rule. All employees of the six financial institutions of the Shanghai Four Great Families, "Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank", "Central Trust Bureau," and "Postal Remittances Bureau," as well as all staff of the Shanghai Chiang bandit Central News Agency Broadcasting Department, also held "sit-in strikes" last month to demand wage increases and resist arrests. Workers in the Tianjin Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau Machinery Factory and workers managing the ship locks held a joint strike last month. At the same time, workers in the Chiang bandit Wuhan Clothing General Factory, where the massacre of workers had been delayed for four months without resolution, were forced by hunger to snatch rice to fill their stomachs. The Chiang bandit authorities arrested more than four hundred workers on the spot, and a large number of workers' families went to the Chiang bandit Wuhan Office to protest the arrests. At the end of last month, the Shanghai Chiang bandit authorities arrested 162 workers in the British-owned tram, French-owned water and electricity, silk weaving, and dyeing industries in a few days. At the beginning of this month, they also closed down the Shanghai Silk Industry Workers' Union, the Canned Food Industry Workers' Union, and the Chinese Technicians' Union, and prohibited "more than five workers from gathering in one place." Workers in national capital enterprises, in order to maintain their livelihoods and oppose excessive exploitation by the capitalists, also demanded appropriate improvements in treatment from the capitalists. In January, employees of Shanghai fashion industry and Pudong Zhanghua Wool Weaving Factory demanded that the capitalists issue year-end bonuses because they could not afford to celebrate the New Year, and they negotiated to seek reasonable solutions. However, when the capitalists' attitude was stubborn, the workers were also forced to take a tough stance. Workers at Shanghai Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory and Yifeng Enamel Factory, after their demand for monthly salary payment according to the "cost of living index" was rejected by the capitalists, went on strike and hunger strike in protest in the middle of last month. Workers in Hankou, Western clothing, shipbuilding, mud, wood and other industries went on strike at the beginning of last month because the capitalists refused to improve their treatment, but when the capitalists agreed to appropriately improve the treatment of employees, most of these incidents were quickly resolved reasonably. Workers have also united with capitalists to resist common enemies in order to survive. In the middle of last month, the Mentougou Sino-British Coal Mining Company, a bureaucratic capital of the Four Great Families, colluded with the Chiang bandit garrison to seal up eight small kilns in Chengzicun in order to expand its territory. The four thousand workers and kiln owners of the eight small kilns and other small kilns immediately launched a joint strike and refused to pay all donations and taxes to the Chiang bandit in order to resist the barbaric plunder by the Chiang family bandits.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 16th: According to Chiang area newspaper reports: Shanghai workers are persisting in their struggle under the cruel suppression of the Chiang bandits. The Second Factory of Shenxin Textile Factory, a bureaucratic capital, recently tried to dismiss some workers on the pretext of streamlining. More than 2,000 workers in the factory went on strike in protest on the 15th of last month to demand job security. Employees of the British-owned Tram Company once went on strike in the middle of last month. Later, because the company unreasonably rejected the employees' demands for improved treatment, all 300-plus internal affairs employees went on strike again for half a day on the 18th of last month in protest and sent representatives to petition. More than 800 workers at the Tieli Iron Factory launched a full-scale slowdown on the 22nd of last month in protest against the factory's unreasonable dismissal of Fan Genbao, Zhuang Liangen and other eight people who had represented the workers in慰问 the injured workers of the Shenxin No. 9 Factory massacre, and the unreasonable measure of expelling five apprentices.

　　从阳历年关到现在
    蒋区工人一直坚持斗争
    绝食罢工运动遍及四十多行业
    【新华社陕北十六日电】综合报导：新历年关以来，蒋区工人反饥饿反压迫救死求生的斗争，遍及沪、宁、平、津、青、汉、广州、南昌等大小城市，直接间接卷入运动的职工包括纺织、毛织、丝织、染织、针织、时装、西装、被服、百货、罐头、搪瓷、电筒、化学、西药、火柴、卷烟、金融、银行、广播、印刷、水电交通、煤矿、机械、造船、船闸、轮船、海关、领港、水手等四十余行业。其中纺织、交通、被服、海关等业职工的反饥饿运动曾彼伏此起，数度罢工怠工，人数曾一厂一次达万余名之多。
    四大家族官僚资本与帝国主义企业中的工人，因身受残酷压迫与超额剥削，新历年关前后即不断进行英勇反抗。年前蒋匪南京江南公共汽车公司及美帝控制下的江海关等职工，因无法过年而要求增资及年赏而举行绝食、怠工、罢工后，年关工潮逐渐扩展，直至官僚资本中纺公司所属的上海申新纱厂惨案的发生而达于高潮。该厂第九厂六千余工人（绝大多数为女工）为争取合理生活待遇及要求年赏，于一月三十日开始罢工，至二月二日上海蒋匪当局竟出动全市军警宪特，以坦克、装甲车、摩托车队包围该厂，蒋匪淞沪警备司令刽子手宣铁吾公然血腥狂吠：“格杀不论，一切由我负责”，在上海蒋匪警察局长俞叔平亲自指挥下，以施放催泪弹，用美式机枪、步枪及剌刀屠杀男女徒手工人，当场工人死伤达六十余名，被捕三百余人，当时工人曾英勇进行自卫，许多女工占据工场屋顶，以铁片、砖石、板凳向蒋家法西斯野兽还击，工潮即迅速转变为反压迫反杀人统治的斗争。上海四大家族“中中交农”及“中信局”、“邮汇局”等六金融机关及上海蒋匪中央社广播部全体职员，亦因要求增薪及反抗捕人暴行，于上月举行“静坐罢工”。蒋匪塘沽新港工程局机械工厂工人及管理船闸工人，曾于上月举行联合罢工，与此同时，枪杀工人惨案拖延四月之久尚未解决的蒋匪武汉被服总厂工人，则因迫于饥饿，抢米充饥，蒋匪当局当场逮捕工人达四百余名，大批工人眷属即群至蒋匪武汉行辕抗议捕人暴行。上月底上海蒋匪当局几天内分别逮捕英商电车、法商水电、丝织、染织等业工人达一百六十二名，本月初又封闭上海丝业工人工会、罐头业工人工会及中国技师工会等，并禁止“五人以上的工人聚集于一处”。在民族资本企业中的工人，为了维持生活反对资方过分剥削，亦向资方要求适当改善待遇。一月间沪时装业及浦东章华毛织厂职工因无法过年，要求资方发给年赏，均以商谈方式进行，以求得合理解决。但当资方态度固执时，工人亦被迫采取强硬态度。上海新亚药厂及益丰搪瓷厂工人因要求按照“生活指数”当月发薪遭资方拒绝后，即于上月中怠工、绝食抗议。汉口、西服、造船、泥、木等业工人均因资方拒不改善待遇，而于上月初举行罢工，但当资方答应适当改善职工待遇时，这些事件大多数即迅速得到合理解决。工人们亦曾和资本家联合起来，反抗共同敌人，以求得生存。四大家族官僚资本之门头沟中英煤矿公司上月中为扩张地盘，串同蒋匪驻军查封城子村八处小窑，八小窑四千工人和窑主及其他各小窑当即联合罢工，并拒缴蒋匪一切捐税，以反抗共同的敌人蒋家匪帮此项野蛮的掠夺。
