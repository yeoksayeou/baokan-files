　　When the work group first went to the countryside, every comrade was in high spirits, imagining that with the land law solving problems, the masses would surely be easily mobilized, and it would be a vigorous and dynamic effort. On the eighth, they arrived at Ruzuo. After ten days of work, more than a hundred poor peasants had been connected. Just as the poor peasant association was about to be established, on the eighteenth, they were transferred to Xiyan Village. At that time, they thought: "Going to Xiyan Village means starting from scratch again, which is ten days to half a month behind other pilot villages. Others are already ahead, but we are still the 'Prefectural Committee Research Office.' What role can we play as a pilot village?" Originally, their minds were already burning with the fire of acute impatience, and this added fuel to the flames, making them even more anxious. As soon as they arrived in Xiyan Village, on the one hand, they briefly understood the general situation of the village, preparing to hold a village meeting. At the same time, they emphasized the need to find key figures and establish a poor peasant association. At that time, they believed that with the Ruzuo experience, the masses would demand to be organized as soon as the meeting was held. If we didn't find key figures, no one would take the lead, and we would be left behind the masses. In addition, they also felt that understanding the situation after the poor peasant association was established would guarantee that it would be more real and systematic.

　　On the evening of the twenty-first, they held a village meeting (another comrade had held one before, this was the second). On the twenty-third, they set a five-day plan: First, hold a branch party member meeting, mobilize them, and then investigate class status; the second step was to investigate mistakes and absorb the participation of the masses. Call a meeting of key figures to discuss how to connect and organize the poor peasant association, and then call a meeting of the poor peasant class to call on them to connect immediately and organize quickly.

　　After the branch meeting, they prepared to hold a meeting of key figures, so they concentrated all their efforts on finding key figures. The method they adopted was not to combine it with small meetings, but to act independently. They learned from the masses about a few honest people who had not turned over well, such as Bai Rong, Gao Sanzong, etc., and went to their homes several times a day. Seeing that Xu Huanwen dared to say a few words to us, they only wanted to go to his house. When they arrived at the homes of poor peasants who had turned over relatively well or some honest people who were not good at speaking, they felt that they were not the target and were unwilling to go to their homes. During the conversation, they generally only said: "Poor people want to be masters of their own affairs, organize a poor peasant association," hoping that after such a simple mobilization, they could be motivated. At the same time, they also showed that they were eager for materials. If the masses did not reply, they would be discouraged and speak less. If the masses talked about some family matters, the comrades were unwilling to listen. As a result, the masses generally knew that we were investigating, and even feared us. Xu Huanwen, Wang Xiaocheng, and other activists asked us when they saw us: "Are you investigating whether I am good or bad?" When we asked him: "How is so-and-so?", they all replied: "Haven't you investigated clearly yet? How can you not know?" Because we approached too few people, and the conversation was too rushed, they felt isolated and feared future struggles. The masses said their own bad things, and Bai Rong and others were afraid of being made leaders, so they avoided meeting us.

　　After a few days, they only found four or five targets, some of whom had only met once or twice (they had asked him and inquired about him many times), and they didn't have a deep understanding of this person. They didn't show much enthusiasm for organizing connections, but they didn't understand what they were worried about. They only saw that these people were not energetic and not close to them. For example, Xu Huanwen was a more mature target, but in the conversation, he mostly used a tentative tone.

　　At the meeting on the evening of the thirtieth to discuss borrowing grain from the fruits of struggle, it was all households that had no grain to eat. The work group imagined that these families had nothing to eat, and if they said they could borrow grain, they would definitely be in high spirits and trust the work group even more. However, because they had not been fully prepared in advance, no one said anything, and even after a round of mobilization and enlightenment, there was no result, and the meeting broke up unhappily. From this lesson, they realized that no matter what they do, they must be fully prepared in advance, and it is not enough to start from subjective wishes alone.

　　The root cause of the acute impatience is that there is a great deal of one-sidedness in the work group's thinking methods. They did not start from the most urgent demands of the local masses and the existing level of awareness of the masses. They subjectively wanted to turn their wishes into reality and were eager for quick results. At the same time, the deeply rooted bad work style of being bossy, doing everything for the masses, and being careless has not been transformed. Therefore, in actual work, they become impatient when they encounter actual things. With a half-baked understanding of the situation, they become complacent and the method of understanding the situation is too simple, only wanting to take shortcuts. The most basic reason is that they have individualism and are eager for success. They only want the masses to satisfy their own wishes -- "want materials," "organize a poor peasant association," "play a pilot role" -- and not to patiently understand the masses, start from the demands of the masses, and do things for the masses.

　　After the self-criticism, they set out specific methods for the next few days: combining individual visits, small chats, and, when necessary, large meetings. Approach more people, chat deeply at night, and conduct individual in-depth interviews during the day, making it broad and deep. They will also work with those who have turned over well, correct their attitude of ignoring these people, and strive to integrate with the masses. Understand the overall situation, understand the current urgent demands of the majority of the masses, discover activists, and call on the masses to organize themselves to solve their own problems.

### 永年西沿村工作组检查急性病

　　永年西沿村工作组检查急性病
    开始下乡时，工作组每个同志情绪都很高，想象着土地法这样解决问题，群众一定好发动，一定轰轰烈烈。八号到达茹佐，经过十天工夫，贫农已串连起来百余人。快要成立起来贫农团时，十八号又调到西沿村，当时就想到：“到西沿村还得重新插手，可比别的基点村落后十天至半月，人家都跑到头里了，咱还是‘地委调研室’，还能起啥基点村作用呢？”本来思想上，正是烧着急性病的火，这样又加了点油，更急起来。一到西沿村，一方面简单了解村中一般情况，准备开村民会，同时就强调提出找骨干，成立贫农团。当时认为有茹佐经验，一开罢会群众就要求组织起来，咱要不找个骨干，没人领头，恐落群众之后了。此外还觉得情况的了解，在贫农团成立起来后，才能保证更真实和系统。
    二十一号晚上召开了村民会（前有别的同志开过一次，这是第二次），二十三号订了个五天计划：首先召开支部党员会，动员后查阶级；第二步查错误，吸收群众参加。召开骨干分子会，商讨如何串连组织贫农团，随即召开贫农阶层会，号召马上就串连，很快就组织起来。
    召开支部会后，准备开骨干分子会，于是就集中全力找骨干，采用的方式没和开小型的会议相结合，而是独政，从群众中了解出几个翻身不很好的老实人，如白荣、高三仲等，就一天向他家去好几次，许焕文见我们还敢说两句，光愿去他家，到了翻身比较好的贫农家或一些不好说话的老实人家，就觉着不是对象，不愿向他家去。谈话时，一般的只是说：“穷人要当家，组织贫农团”，希望经过如此的简单动员，就能动起来。同时还表现急于要材料，群众不答复，自己就泄气了，说话也减少了，如果群众再谈家长里短的一些事，同志们也不愿听。这样闹的结果，群众普遍知道我们是调查，甚而恐惧。许焕文、王小成等积极分子，见我们就问：“你调查我好坏？”在我们一问他：“某某人怎么样？”他们均是回答：“您还没调查清？还能不知道？”因我们接近的人太少，谈话又急，致使他们精神感觉孤立，怕将来起斗争。群众说自己的坏事，白荣等还怕叫他当头，就躲开不见我们的面了。
    几天后，只找到四、五个对象，有一些是只面谈过一两次话（找他，打听他的次数不少），对这个人了解也不深刻，他们表现要求组织串连劲不大，但也没了解出他顾虑的什么。只看这些人没劲和自己不亲热。如许焕文是较成熟的对象，但在谈话时还多是试探口吻。
    三十号晚上商讨借斗争果实粮的会议上，净是没粮吃的户。工作组想象这些人家里没啥吃，一说可以借粮，一定情绪很高，对工作组会更相信。可是因事先没酝酿成熟，结果谁也不吭，动员启发一顿也无结果，不欢而散了。从这次教训，才了解到无论办啥事，也得事先酝酿成熟，只是从主观愿望出发是不行的。
    检讨急性病的根源，是工作组思想方法上存有很大的片面性，没从当地群众目前最迫切要求和群众现有觉悟水平出发，主观愿望想变为事实，急于求成。同时，根深蒂固的包办代替粗枝大叶的恶劣作风未得改造，因此在实际工作中，一遇实际事就心急，有了个一知半解的情况，就自满起来，了解情况办法太简单，光想走捷径。最基本的原因是存有个人主义急于求功。光想叫群众满足自己的愿望——“要材料”、“组织贫农团”、“起个基点作用”，不是从耐心了解群众，从群众要求出发，为群众办事。
    检讨后，定出以后几天内的具体作法：个别访问小型的漫谈会，以及必要时的大会结合起来。更多接近一些人，晚上漫谈，白天个别深入，使之广泛又纵深。对翻身好的也要进行工作，纠正对这些人不理睬的态度，求得与群众打成一片。了解全面情况，了解多数群众目前的迫切要求，发现积极分子，号召群众组织起来解决自己的问题。
