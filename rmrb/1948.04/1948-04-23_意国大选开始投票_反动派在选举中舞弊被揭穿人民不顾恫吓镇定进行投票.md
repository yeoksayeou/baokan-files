Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Rome dispatch: The Italian general election began on the 18th and will continue until 2 pm on the 19th. On the morning of the 18th, voters lined up in front of the polling stations to wait for voting, and the voting situation was calm on that day. This Italian general election will elect members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, each with a term of two years. The House of Representatives will elect 574 members, i.e., one member for every 80,000 people (based on the 1946 national population statistics of 45,773,000), and citizens who have reached the age of 21 can participate in the House of Representatives election. The number of voters is 29,098,085. The Senate will elect 237 members, and citizens who have reached the age of 25 can also participate in the Senate election. The country is divided into 31 electoral districts, the largest of which is Rome, which will elect 37 members. There are 41,647 polling stations throughout Italy.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Rome dispatch: From the morning of the 19th, voting continued throughout Italy. It is estimated that the vote counting at each polling station will not be completed until 6 pm on the 20th. On the first day of the general election (the 18th), voters at several polling stations in Rome, Milan, Reggio Emilia province, Ancona, and Naples, angrily exposed the Gasperi government's conspiracies and tricks in the election, namely, they had already marked the Christian Democratic Party's cross symbol on the ballots issued to voters, attempting to invalidate votes against the Christian Democratic Party. After the executive committee of the People's Democratic Front raised a firm protest, Sherba had no choice but to issue an order to the chairmen of each polling station: not to invalidate such ballots. People in many places also revealed that monks and nuns had two or three ballots each, or voted twice in different polling stations. It is reported that the scale of such fraud by priests and the Christian Democratic Party is much larger than in 1946. The district executive committee of the People's Democratic Front issued a call to the representatives and vote counters of each party in the front, urging them to increase their vigilance a hundredfold to perform their duties at the polling stations and systematically expose all violations of the election law. On the evening of the 18th, Sherba's police, without any reason, drove tanks and armored vehicles, and carried machine guns to patrol the streets of various cities and industrial centers in Rome province, carrying out intimidation. However, the people of Rome suppressed their anger and voted calmly and orderly. The executive committee of the People's Democratic Front's Rome organization expressed congratulations in its special bulletin to "all the workers and personnel of the front's organizations at all levels who demonstrated outstanding examples of strength, composure, and discipline on the first day of the election."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: According to TASS, New York, 17th: US Republican Senator Lodge, in a speech in New Orleans, expressed great fear about "the Italian Communist Party gaining popular support." He said: "Although the United States has spent a large amount of money, it still cannot guarantee its influence in other countries. The US campaign has spent $180 million in Italy, and in the same period, the number of Italian Communist Party members has increased sharply from 60,000 to 2.5 million" (Note: The number of Italian Communist Party members at the Sixth Congress in January this year was 2,283,048).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Rome dispatch: On the eve of the Italian general election, the Gasperi government intensified its incitement of bandits to provoke incidents. On the 17th, in Gorizia (Istrian Peninsula), fascist bandits armed with submachine guns and tear gas attempted to attack the local Communist Party headquarters and several branches. Due to the resolute counterattack by the party headquarters personnel, the fascist bandits were repelled. Afterwards, the bandits gathered again to surround the Communist Party headquarters, firing at the windows and throwing grenades. This barbaric behavior aroused the anger of the local people, who rose up to attack and finally dispersed the fascist bandits.

　　意国大选开始投票
    反动派在选举中舞弊被揭穿人民不顾恫吓镇定进行投票
    【新华社陕北二十日电】罗马讯：意大选已于十八日开始，投票将继续到十九日下午二时为止。十八日清晨，选民们即在投票处前列队等候投票，是日投票情形平静。意大利这次大选将选举参众两院，任期各为二年。众议院将选出五七四席议员，即每八万人选一众议员（根据一九四六年的全国人口统计为四千五百七十七万三千人），凡年届二十一岁的公民皆可参加众院选举，选民数目为二千九百零九万八千另八十五人。参议院将选出二百三十七席议员，凡年届二十五岁的公民同时可参加参院选举。全国共分三十一个选区，最大的是罗马，将选出三十七个议员。全意设有四万一千六百四十七个投票处。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】罗马讯：十九日清晨起，全意各地继续投票，据估计，投票结束后，各投票处的计票将于二十日下午六时始告完毕。大选第一日（十八日），罗马、米兰、艾米里亚省的勒佐、安科纳及那不勒斯等地的若干投票处的选民，愤怒地揭露加斯贝利政府在选举中的阴谋诡计，即他们在发给选民的选票上，已经划上了基督教民主党的十字形符号，企图以此将投反对基督教民主党的选票作废。经人民民主阵线执委会提出坚决抗议后，谢尔巴才无可抵赖地向各投票处主席发布命令：不将这种选票作废。许多地方的人民亦纷纷揭露修道士和修女每人有两三张选票，或在不同的投票处投两次票。据悉：牧师与基督教民主党此等舞弊，其规模比一九四六年时要大得多。人民民主阵线区执行委员会向该阵线各党代表和计票者发出号召，力促他们提高百倍的警惕来执行选举处的职务，并有系统地揭发一切违犯选举法的行为。十八日晚，谢尔巴的警察毫无理由的驾驶着坦克、装甲车；并携带机枪巡逻罗马省各城市及工业中心街道，实行恫吓，但罗马人民压抑着愤怒，仍镇定而有秩序的投票。人民民主阵线罗马组织的执委会在其特别公报中，向“所有那些在选举第一日表现了力量、沉着和纪律之出色范例的工人和该阵线各级组织的人员”，表示贺忱。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据塔斯社纽约十七日讯：美共和党参议员洛基在新奥尔良演说时，对“意共产党获得人民支持”表示非常忧惧。他说：“虽然美国花费了大批金钱，但仍不能保证它在其他国家中的影响。美国战役，在意大利已花费十八万万美元，而在同一时期，意共党员竟已从六万人猛增至二百五十万人”（按今年一月意共六大时党员数为二百二十八万三千另四十八人）。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】罗马讯：意大选前夕，加斯贝利政府更变本加厉嗾使其匪徒四出挑衅。十七日，在哥立柴（伊斯特利亚半岛）地方以手提机枪及催泪弹武装的法西斯匪徒，企图袭击该地共产党党部及若干支部，由于党部人员的坚决回击，法西斯匪徒才被击退。此后，匪徒又纠集包围共产党党部，向窗口开枪，投掷手榴弹。此种横蛮行为激起当地人民的愤怒，群起攻击，终将法西斯匪徒驱散。
