In Yubei, our army's morale to kill the enemy is extremely high.
    Annihilating over a hundred bandits outside Anyang
    Annihilating sixty Yan bandits east of Shouyang City
    [Reported from Anyang by this newspaper] As our southern army liberates Luoyang, Gongxian, and Sishui for the second time, and advances towards the outskirts of Zhengzhou, the enemy in Anyang are in a state of panic, attempting to redeploy south. Our 52nd unit was ordered to block them, forcing the enemy to resort to air transport. Immediately after the enemy's airlift, our 52nd regiment launched a surprise attack on Xiaoying Village, an outer stronghold on the outskirts of Anyang, on the night of the 15th. The attack began at (the 16th) at 1:00 AM. After an hour and a half of intense fighting, they finally annihilated all three squadrons of the Jian'an Township, Jianxin Township, and Tangyin's refugee former county's "Returning Home Corps" guarding the stronghold, as well as the headquarters of the former county's "Returning Home Corps" battalion. A total of 130 enemy and puppet captains Huo Juri, Shi Zhenggang, and cultural director Dai Zhenzhong were captured alive. Over 30 battalion commanders and supervisors were killed or wounded. Seized were 71 rifles, 11 Mauser pistols, 1 six-shooter, 1 eight-sound rifle, 2,283 rounds of various bullets, 6 small mortar shells, 2 war horses, 5 mules, 20,000 yuan in Customs Gold Units, 347,000 yuan in legal tender, 2 bicycles, a set of documents, and a set of military uniforms and supplies.
    This battle, on the eve of our victory in the liberation of Tangyin and the successful conclusion of the Three Check-ups Study Campaign, was marked by extremely high fighting enthusiasm. For example, in the engineering squad led by Qin Jinhai, under the cover of fierce artillery fire, he and three comrades placed explosives on the southeastern blockhouse for the first time, blasting a crack more than a foot wide in the blockhouse, killing eight enemies. The enemy still resisted stubbornly. At this time, the brave soldiers of our first battalion rushed up and eliminated all the defenders. The second time, they destroyed a blockhouse in the east-west direction, killing five enemies. The squad led by squad leader Yang Quanbao killed four enemies on the third blockhouse. At this time, the brave soldiers of the third battalion rushed up to the blockhouse, and the seventh company alone captured 45 rifles and 2 pistols. The enemy's reinforcements, under the strong resistance of our second battalion, turned tail and fled.
    In this battle, we only suffered three injuries and one death, creating a victorious record with a ratio of one to forty. (Zhang Xian)
