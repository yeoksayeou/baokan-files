　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are currently striving to strengthen their enslavement of the Yi ethnic compatriots on the border of Sichuan, Kangding (Xikang), and Yunnan. The Chiang bandits' "Sichuan-Kangding-Yunnan Border Affairs Conference" opened in Xichang on the 12th, discussing the so-called "Yi Affairs Governance Plan." The content includes implementing a slave-like education system and sowing discord among the Yi ethnic compatriots. The main objective is to designate nineteen counties and two administrative bureaus on the border of the three provinces as enslavement areas, seize Yi people's land, and conscript one million Yi people to organize "Reclamation Teams" to engage in slave labor producing food for the Chiang bandits, and to provide them with military training, preparing to drive them to serve as cannon fodder for the Chiang bandits. To promote the above plan, a "Southwest Reclamation Bureau" will be established. This plan was drafted by He Guoguang, Deputy Director of the Chiang Kai-shek Chongqing Headquarters and concurrently Commander of the Xichang Garrison, and approved by Chiang Kai-shek. The designated area includes five counties in Sichuan: Leibo, Mabian, Pingshan, Ebian, and Shujian; ten counties in Xikang: Xichang, Huili, Mianning, Yuexi, Zhaojue, Derong, Yanyuan, Yanbian, Ningnan, and Jiulong, as well as the Ningdong Administrative Bureau; and five counties in Yunnan: Yongsheng, Huaping, Yongren, Qiaojia, and Yongshan, as well as the Ninglang Administrative Bureau. In order to forcibly occupy the fertile land of the Yi people, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities have continuously launched wars of massacre against the Yi people since 1944, encountering stubborn resistance from the Yi people. To this day, the Yi people's self-defense armed forces on the Sichuan-Kangding-Yunnan border are still fighting the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. This enslavement plan of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits will inevitably arouse more powerful resistance from the Yi people.

　　蒋匪奴役彝胞  必遭坚强抵抗
    【新华社陕北十六日电】综合各方消息：蒋匪现正力图加强对川康滇边境彝（夷）族同胞的奴役。蒋匪“川康滇边务会议”，已于十二日在西昌开幕，讨论所谓“夷务治理计划”，内容除实施奴化教育，挑拨彝族同胞团结外；主要为圈划三省边境十九县两设治局为奴役地区，夺取彝族田地，征拨一百万彝族人民组织“屯垦队”，为蒋匪从事奴隶劳动生产粮食，并施以军事训练，准备驱使充当蒋匪炮灰。为推行上项计划将设立一“西南屯垦局”。按此计划系由蒋重庆行辕副主任兼西昌警备司令贺匪国光所拟，经蒋匪批准。其圈划地区包括四川的雷波、马边、屏山、峨边、沭川五县；西康的西昌、会里、冕宁、越＠、昭觉、德荣、盐源、盐边、宁南、九龙等十县及宁东设治局；云南的永胜、华坪、永仁、巧家、永善等五县及宁蒗设治局。蒋匪当局为强占彝族的肥沃土地，自一九四四年以来，即不断发动屠杀彝人的战争，遭到彝族人民顽强抵抗，迄今川康滇边彝族人民自卫武装仍与蒋匪周旋。此次蒋匪的奴役计划，必将激起彝族人民更有力的反抗。
