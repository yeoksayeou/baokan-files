　　Resolutely Dismantle Sectarianism

The purpose of carrying out democratic party rectification is to promote progress in all aspects of rural areas and establish a genuine democratic rural life. In many rural branches in our district, due to long-term secrecy in the past, bad elements have cut off the connection between party leaders and the masses, and some have even formed anti-people cliques, engaging in sectarianism against the people. After some villages underwent this public party rectification, fully promoting democracy and accepting mass review and criticism of every party member, this unhealthy phenomenon has begun to be broken, and the relationship between the party and the masses has been greatly improved, which will undoubtedly play a decisive role in promoting rural progress. However, on the other hand, due to the influence of feudalism in the past, various sectarian cliques still remain in many villages and are exploited by a few ambitious elements, undermining unity and creating opposition among farmers. These cliques must be resolutely dismantled in this democratic party rectification movement to ensure the sound establishment of democratic rural life and achieve genuine unity in rural areas.

Zhao Village and other villages in the Ninth District of Wu'an, in the process of reorganizing the peasant ranks, emphasized that only unity is allowed, and division is not allowed, and this principle was implemented in the masses ideologically and organizationally, ensuring the sound establishment of democratic rural life, which is very good. The biggest characteristic of ambitious elements and their cliques in rural areas who harbor sectarian sentiments is that they only care about the interests of their own small sect, quibble, are biased and one-sided, and exploit the blindness of the masses to achieve their personal desires and attempts. If the leadership is not sober-minded, lacks principles, and fails to pay attention to exposure in a timely manner, it will fuel their arrogance, making the masses feel unclear about right and wrong, and unable to distinguish between the important and the less important, leading the movement in the wrong direction. The masses generally do not sympathize with sectarian remarks and actions, but at the beginning, they often do not dare to openly oppose them. If the leadership provides side enlightenment or public exposure, it is not only not pouring cold water, but also supporting the masses. Some people emphasize one-sided "mass viewpoints" and "valuable mass enthusiasm," and let sectarian remarks and actions go unchecked, which will inevitably create obstacles to the movement and should be corrected.

　　坚决拆散宗派
    整党民主的进行，其目的是在推进农村各方面的进步，建立真正的农村民主生活。我区不少农村支部，由于过去长期秘密，使得坏分子把党的领导者与群众的联系隔断了，有些甚至形成了反人民的小集团，向人民闹宗派。若干村庄经过这次党的公开，充分发扬民主，接受群众审查与批评每一个党员，这一不良现象已开始打破，党与群众关系也已大大改进，这对推动农村进步无疑地将能起决定作用。但另一方面，由于受过去封建影响，至今在不少村庄中仍残留有各种各样的宗派性的小集团，被少数野心分子所利用，破坏团结，造成农民间的对立，亦必须在这次整党民主运动中，坚决予以拆散，才能保证农村民主生活的健全建立，达到农村中的真正团结。
    武安九区赵庄等村，在整编农民队伍的过程中，强调只许讲团结，不准闹分裂，并在思想上、组织上把这一方针贯彻在群众中，保证了农村民主生活的健全建立，这是很好的。农村中抱有宗派情绪的野心分子及其小集团，最大的特点是只管自己小宗派的利益，强词夺理，偏激片面，利用群众盲目，达到其个人欲望与企图。如果领导上不清醒，缺乏原则性，不能及时注意揭露，就会助长其气焰，使群众感到是非不明，轻重不分，把运动引向错误的道路上去。群众对抱有宗派性的言论与行动，一般是不同情的，但开始往往不敢公然起来反对，如果领导上予以侧面启发或公开的揭露，不但不是泼冷水，而且是给群众撑了腰。有些人强调片面的“群众观点”与“宝贵群众的热情”，对宗派性的言论与行动，放任不管，终必造成运动的障碍，是应该纠正的。
