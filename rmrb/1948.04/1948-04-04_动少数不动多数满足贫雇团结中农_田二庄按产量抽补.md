  　Tian Erzhuang Adopts Output-Based Land Redistribution
    Remind New Cadres to Care for Poor Brothers
    Wrongly Accused Middle Peasant Yang Mao Shi Gets Land and Ox Back This Time
    [Our News] The land redistribution work in Tian Erzhuang, Wu'an, has been completed after full discussion and careful calculation. The problems encountered in the redistribution are reported as follows: First, who to give to? The village has 103 households, 361 people, with a total output of 887.82 shi, and an average output of 2.459 dou per person. Current output: 16 poor peasant households, with an average of 2.308 dou per person. 35 new middle peasant households, with an average of 2.91 dou per person. 25 old middle peasant households, with an average of 3.078 dou per person. 5 upper-middle peasant households, with an average of 2.996 dou per person. 22 households that were struggled against, with an average of 0.909 dou per person. The problem is very obvious: those households that were struggled against need a large amount of land to be supplemented. After the whole village peasant congress raised the issue of "filling the holes," evaluated the "holes," and the peasant association committee conducted centralized research, it was decided that 4 poor peasant households needed land to be supplemented, and the households that were struggled against needed land to be supplemented to reach an output of about 90 shi. Second, whose land to take? First, cadres, party members, and those related to them in the past occupied more land; after this party rectification, awareness has been raised, and 18 households have withdrawn and "voluntarily" returned 121.3 mu of land. The peasant association committee stipulated two principles for the cadre land return and voluntary land surrender: (1) Land that was forcibly occupied or cheaply bought by "troublemakers" (exchanging bad for good) must be returned, while "old root land" will not be touched. (2) The output after land return must not be lower than the average output. They said, "We are one family, what should be returned must be returned, and what should not be returned must be left for them." After evaluation, among the 121 mu returned by cadres, 66.3 mu should be returned or could be taken, amounting to an output of 49.4 dou. Second, the school land, peasant association land, and land of households without successors yielded 7.3 dou, and the "air raid shelter" land yielded 2.5 dou. In total, the above two items amounted to 51.5 dou, still short of about 30 shi. Third, new and old middle peasants are willing to voluntarily give up land. This village has an average of more than 3.8 mu of land per person, but the whole village has about 90 male laborers, and 1370 mu of land, with each laborer averaging about 15 mu of land, plus each household has a vegetable garden, so there is more land than labor, and therefore new and old middle peasants voluntarily gave up a lot of land; however, the peasant association committee, according to the Central Bureau's instructions to "mobilize the few and not the majority," adopted two principles for voluntary land surrender, regardless of whether they were new or old middle peasants: (1) It must be voluntary; (2) It must not be lower than the average output. Therefore, the acceptance of land was very cautious. For example, when the middle peasant woman Shuang Lan wanted to voluntarily give up land, the peasant association committee calculated her output, and found that after giving up the land, it was lower than the average output, so they did not allow her to voluntarily give it up. After talking for two days, she insisted on voluntarily giving it up, saying, "I don't have labor, and participating in mutual aid, sending manure, feeding livestock, cutting grass, and doing errands all require extra effort. Calculating it all, it's not worth it. I wanted to give it up last year, but I couldn't, and this time I must give it up." The peasant association had no choice but to keep it, and planned to take care of her from the floating wealth. Another example is the old middle peasant Cao Nanfang who came to the peasant association committee to report "voluntary" land surrender. The committee members first registered it, and then after discussion, estimated that he was definitely not voluntary, so they sent someone to explain to him, saying, "If you want to cultivate this land, you can still cultivate it. Having a high output doesn't necessarily mean that the land will be taken away. If you really want to give it up, then do so, it's up to you." Cao Nanfang said, "In that case, I'll just cultivate it myself." Poor peasants were given fertile land to compensate for barren land. The output of the land taken and the 3 households who voluntarily gave up land was 7.39 dou, and the new middle peasants voluntarily gave up a little over 10 dou, and the old middle peasants voluntarily gave up 25 dou; in total, no more than 15 households of new and old middle peasants gave up land (excluding those cadres who returned the land they had occupied more of), accounting for 3.2% of the 65 middle peasant households in the village, giving up a total of 23.5 dou. The above three items, namely cadre land return, public land, and middle peasant voluntary land surrender, totaled 99 shi in output. After the peasant association had this number, they immediately started to carry out the redistribution and adjustment work.
    First, satisfy the demands of the poor peasants and hired laborers who had not yet turned themselves around. This encountered great difficulties. For example, the poor old widow Yang Jinzhi, a single person, had three mu of good land and three mu of bad land. Because she had no labor, she often paid wages, and the grain was not enough to eat. She requested to exchange the three mu of bad land for good land. The peasant association committee studied the matter and thought that it would be better to give her money than land, and deposit an old-age share in the cooperative. However, they decided this without consulting her beforehand, and took away her bad land. When she heard about it, she cried and was dissatisfied with the land redistribution. At first, the peasant association committee members felt that it was a good thing to do, and if she was not satisfied, they did not want to care about her anymore. The young An Bao Bao had poor labor and a lot of bad land. He had left some land uncultivated last year, and this time he requested to return 4.6 mu of middle and lower-grade land (1.77 dou). Individual peasant association committee members mechanically handled the matter according to output and showed annoyance, not allowing him to return the land. He said to the peasant association committee member Yang Jiuzi (a poor peasant), "If I don't return the land, I can't cultivate it all, and what I harvest is not enough to pay the wage rice." Jiuzi said, "If you can't cultivate it all, can't you find someone!" Bao Bao went home and cried. In short, poor, widowed, old, and weak peasants demanded less land of better quality. But they are now in the minority and cannot speak for themselves. Although there are two poor peasants on the peasant association committee, they are better off because they have their own labor. The new middle peasant committee members are even more so. These committee members do not have enough consideration for their difficulties, or have begun to forget them. They do not have their own independent organization, and because the poor peasant group is dominated by new middle peasants, their demands have no organizational guarantee. Based on this situation, the work team, on the one hand, educated the new cadres to think more for the brothers who had not yet turned themselves around, and on the other hand, convened meetings of poor peasants and hired laborers who had not yet turned themselves around to mobilize them to insist on their own correct opinions. Finally, the peasant association committee members' thoughts were aligned, and they personally sent people to convene meetings for the poor peasants and hired laborers, and discussed with them in their homes. Jinzhi agreed with the committee's opinion to take her bad land and supplement her with money, and repeatedly instructed, "We are willing, but the money must be enough for us to eat. If it's not enough, we will still suffer." For An Bao Bao, fertile land was given to compensate for barren land, filling in 1.5 mu of top-grade land, amounting to an output of 1.35 dou. In this way, 9 poor peasant households were given land redistribution and adjustment, with an average increase of 0.7 sheng per person, totaling 2.37 dou.
    Secondly, the interests of the middle peasants were taken care of. The old middle peasant Yang Wenqi, who was old and practiced medicine and had weak labor and a poor life, voluntarily gave up 2.6 mu of bad land, yielding 6.5 dou. In order to take care of his life and enable him to better treat the masses, the peasant association committee supplemented him with 1.2 dou of good land. The old middle peasant Yang Xinglong voluntarily gave up 5.7 mu of land, and the peasant association answered his request and supplemented him with 0.28 mu of garden land.
    The biggest problem here is compensating the middle peasants who were wrongly accused. To this end, two tasks were carried out before the redistribution. The first was to correct the class status. During the evaluation, because their economic changes were very complicated, 5 households underwent 6 evaluations before being determined to be middle peasant components, and 1 household underwent 8 investigations before being determined to be middle peasants. In short, the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on class demarcation were correctly implemented. The result of the class demarcation was: 1 household was a landlord and commercial capitalist, 1 household was a rich peasant, 18 households were transformed from landlords and rich peasants into middle peasants, and 2 households were old middle peasants. Second, research "political prisoners" and remove the "spy" hats. It was required that those said to be spies must have evidence and facts, and that no spy hats should be randomly put on those without evidence and facts. Thirteen people wearing "spy" hats stated their shortcomings at the peasant association plenary meeting and also complained about their political distress. After review, except for Yang Wen, whom the masses considered suspicious and had fled, the remaining twelve people had no evidence or facts and had their hats removed on the spot. They said, "It's good to have things cleared up." After doing these two tasks well, their civil rights were restored. When redistributing land, they resolutely restored the middle peasants who had been wrongly accused to middle peasant life. For example, Yang Maoshi, a family of four, had an output of only 2.7 dou after being struggled against, with an average of 0.69 dou per person. The peasant association committee members discussed him and said, "He is just an old middle peasant, and one of our family. We were really sorry to our own brother for wrongly accusing him, and we must return his house and land." He was supplemented with 0.6 mu of the best garden land and 7.5 mu of top-grade dry land, plus his original 3.8 mu of root land, resulting in a much higher output than before he was struggled against. His ox was also returned to him. His son was very grateful and wrote accounts in the peasant association every day. The work was very active. The widow Niu Fuzi had an output of 1.8 shi before the struggle, and this time she was supplemented to 3.14 shi, which was 0.68 dou higher than the average output. Another example is Yang Long'an, a single person who joined the People's Liberation Army three years ago. The peasant association committee members said, "He is fighting for us on the front line, and we must evaluate him in the same way as the masses." He originally had no land, and this time he was supplemented with 3.25 mu of good land, yielding 2.27 shi. It was decided that the land would be cultivated by the mutual aid group, and the grain would be kept by the peasant association. The landlords and rich peasants were also given a share in the same way. (Tian Erzhuang Work Group)

　　动少数不动多数满足贫雇团结中农
  　田二庄按产量抽补
    提醒新干部　关心穷弟兄
    错斗中农杨卯时　这次还地又还牛
    【本报消息】武安田二庄土地抽补工作，经过充分讨论与细密计算，已告完成。兹将抽补中所遇到的问题报导如下：一、填给谁？该村一○三户，三六一人，总产量八八七·八二石，每人平均产量是二石四斗五升九合。现有产量：贫农十六户，每人平均二石三斗零八合。新中农三十五户，每人平均二石九斗一升。老中农二十五户，每人平均三石零七升八合。上中农五户，每人平均二石九斗九升六合。被斗争的二十二户，每人平均九斗零九合。问题很明显：被斗户需要填补大量土地。经全体农民大会提窟窿，评窟窿，再经农会委员会集中研究的结果，贫农有四户需填补土地，被斗户需填补约九十石产量的土地。二、抽谁的？第一，过去干部党员及与他们有关系者，多占了土地；经过此次整党，觉悟提高，十八户就退出与“自动”出一百廿一亩三分地。农会委员会对于干部退地与自动地规定两条原则：（一）强占的或贱买的“捣鬼的”（以坏换好）地退，“老根地”不动。（二）退地后产量不得低于平均产量。他们说：“咱是一家人，该退的退，不该退的还得给人家留着”。评议后，干部退出的一百二十一亩中，该退与可以抽的有六十六亩三分地，合产量四十九石四斗。第二，学校地农会地绝户地产量七石三斗，“防空洞”地二石五斗。合计以上两项，共五十一石五斗，尚差三十来石。第三，新老中农愿自动土地。这村每人平均三亩八分多地，但全村男劳力九十来人，十三顷七十多亩地，每个劳力约平均十五亩多地，再加上每户都有菜园地，地多劳力少，因此新老中农自动出不少土地；但农会委员会根据中央局“动少数不动多数”的指示，对于自动地不分新老中农，都采取了两条原则：（一）必须自愿；（二）不得低于平均产量。因此，接受土地非常慎重。如中农妇女双兰要自动地，农委会计算了她的产量，拿出地后，比平均产量低了，不允许她自动。连着谈了两天，她坚决要自动，她说：“我没有劳力，互助出来，送粪，喂牲口，铡草，支差，负担，都要往外拿。算起来不够本，去年我就要推，没有推出去，这一回非推出去不照”。农会不得已留下了，准备从浮财里照顾她。又如老中农曹南方自己到农委会来报“自动”地，委员先登记了，后来大家研究，估计他决不是自愿的，就派人去给他解释说：“这地你愿意种还可以种，产量高也不一定就往外拿地，真想拿就拿，随你的便”。曹南方说：“这么着，咱就还自己种着吧”。贫农抽瘦补肥，抽的地及三户自动地产量七石三斗九升，新中农自动地十石多点，老中农自动地二十五石；总计新老中农抽地者不过十五户（干部退出多占土地者不包括在内），占全村中农六十五户的百分之三点二，共抽二十三石五斗。以上三项即干部退地、公地及中农自动地，共计产量九十九石。农会有了这个数目之后，即着手进行抽补调剂工作。
    首先满足未翻透身的贫雇农的要求，这可遇到了很大困难。例如贫农老寡妇杨金枝，一口人，有三亩好地，三亩坏地，因无劳力常出工资，粮食不够吃，她要求把三亩坏地换好地。农委会研究，认为给她地不如分给她钱，在合作社存个养老股。但事先没有征求她的同意就这样决定了，并将她的坏地抽出。她听说后哭了，对抽地不满。开始农会委员们自觉那样办是好意，她不满意，即不愿管她的事了。少年安保宝劳力差，坏地多，去年荒了些地，这次要求退出中下地四亩六分（一石七斗七），个别农会委员机械的按产量办，并表现厌烦，不准他退地。他向农会委员杨九子（贫农）说：“不退地种不过来，收的还不够出工资米的哩”。九子说：“种不过来不会觅人哪！”保宝回家哭了。总之，贫农孤寡老弱要求地少地好。但他们现在是少数，又不会说话，农会委员里边虽有两个贫农，但因自己有劳力，生活较好，新中农委员更是如此。这些委员对于他们或她们的困难体贴不够，或开始忘掉了。他（她）们又没有自己的独立的组织，贫农团因新中农占多数，他们的要求已无组织保证。根据这种情况，工作组一方面教育新干部多给未翻身的弟兄设想，一方面召集未翻透身的贫雇农开会，发动他们，坚持自己正确的意见。最后，农会委员思想通了，亲自派人给贫雇农开会，到他们家里商议，金枝同意了委员会抽她坏地多补款子的意见，并再三嘱咐说：“咱愿意，可是钱得够咱吃，不够吃，咱还是受苦受罪。”对于安保宝，给他抽瘦补肥，填上头等地一亩半，合产量一石三斗五升。这样给贫农抽补调剂了九户，平均每人增加七升，合二石三斗七升。
    其次是照顾中农利益。老中农杨文棋，年老行医，劳力弱，生活差，自愿抽出坏地二亩六，产量六斗五。农委会为了照顾他的生活，使他更好的为群众治病，补给他好地产量一石二斗。老中农杨兴隆自动地五亩七分，农会答复他的要求，补给他二分八园地。
    这里最大的问题是补偿被斗错了的中农。为此，在抽补前曾作好两项工作，第一，是订正阶级，在评订中，因为他们的经济变化很复杂，有五户经过了六次的评议划分：才确定为中农成份，一户经过八次的调查研究，确定为中农。总之，正确的执行了中共中央划阶级的指示。划阶级的结果是：一户地主兼商业资本家，一户富农，由地主富农转变成中农者十八户，两户是老中农。第二，研究“政治犯”，摘掉“特务”帽子。说是特务的必须：一有证据，二有事实，无证据无事实者，即不得乱戴特务帽子。十三个戴“特务”帽子的，在农会全体会上说了自己的毛病，又诉了自己在政治上的苦闷。经过审查，除杨文一人，群众认为可疑，且已逃亡外，其余十二人均无证据无事实，当场摘掉帽子。他们说：“只要把事弄清就痛快了。”做好这两项工作以后，恢复了他们的公民权利。抽补土地时，坚决给斗错的中农恢复中农生活。如杨卯时四口人，被斗后，只有二斗七升的产量，每人平均六升九。农会委员讨论他时说：“人家就是个老中农，和咱一家人。斗错了，实在对不住自己弟兄，得给人家退回房子地”。补给他最好园地六分，上等旱地七亩五，他的原根地三亩八，结果，比他未斗争以前的产量提高了很多。他的牛又还给了他，他的儿子感激不尽，每天在农会里写帐。工作很积极。寡妇牛富子，斗争前产量一石八，这次填补到三·一四石，较平均应产量高六斗八。又如杨龙安，一口人，三年前参加解放军，农会委员说：“人家在前线为咱们打仗，就得照群众一样评议”。他原无一亩地，这次补给他好地三亩二分五，产量二·二七石，决定地由互助组代耕，粮食由农会保管。对于富农下降为时不久（刚三年），人口又多的杨至（八口人），这次填给八·一二石，他说：“我人多劳力强，地好，可以维持生活”。地主富农也同样分了一份。（田二庄工分组）
