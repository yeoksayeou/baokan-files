Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th: Chiang's troops besieged in Shenyang are increasingly panicking and wavering, and the number of those defecting to our side is growing daily. In the half-month period from March 25th to April 10th, those who defected to our army's front lines included Li Chunlin, deputy battalion commander of the First Battalion of the Sixth Howitzer Regiment directly under the Shenyang Chiang Bandit Headquarters; Ao Qigeng, company commander of the Second Company of the Second Regiment of the Shenyang Garrison Command; and Zheng Wenlin, secretary of the battalion headquarters of the First Battalion of the Second Regiment of Chiang's Provisional 53rd Division, along with six other officers and twenty-four soldiers of the 71st Army. They were warmly welcomed by the People's Liberation Army upon their arrival, and have been assigned work or sent back to their hometowns. According to Zhu Guolin, a soldier of the 259th Regiment of the 87th Division of Chiang's 71st Army who recently escaped: The trend of desertion among Chiang's troops is rampant. Not only are new recruits deserting in large numbers, but also veteran soldiers. Not long ago, eighteen veteran soldiers from Hunan province in the same company as Zhu Guolin defected to the People's Liberation Army within ten days.
