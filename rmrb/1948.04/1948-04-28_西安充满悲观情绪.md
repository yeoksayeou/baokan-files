Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 26th -- Chen Yuwu, a lieutenant colonel staff officer of the 24th Brigade of the Chiang army, who laid down his arms before the YiChuan campaign on March 1st, recently talked to reporters about his impressions of Xi'an. Chen is from Xintian, Hunan, and is 42 years old. According to him, the morale of junior and mid-level officers in the Chiang army is even lower than before. The officers at the rank of major and captain who are receiving training at the "Cadre Training Class" in Xi'an are all feigning illness to avoid being assigned to frontline units. If a superior gives an order to go, their comrades will see them off with words like: "If you go, be prepared to be captured. Please settle your wife and children in advance." The "Youth Cadre Corps" organized by Chiang Ching-kuo is also filled with pessimism. Chen Yuwu called the Nanjing pseudo-National Assembly a "pack of foxes and dogs" and "dogs fighting." He said, "I saw with my own eyes what the so-called National Assembly election was like in Xi'an." Zhang Zuoting, the president of the Xi'an Chamber of Commerce, monopolized the city's automobiles and paraded around ostentatiously, with advertisements pasted on his car: "Whoever votes for President Zhang will get a free ride." Many restaurants had signs in front of them saying, "Whoever votes for ××× will be treated to a bowl of mutton soup." Chen continued, "The election is just for show, the list was designated long ago. I am a citizen, but I didn't even see a ballot, let alone the soldiers." Chen also said that the people of Xi'an call these "National Assembly representatives" "automobile representatives" or "mutton representatives." There is a saying circulating in Xi'an about the "four major evils," namely young people joining the "army," the aviation "team," the women's "association," and the "National Assembly" "representatives." Chen also said that corruption is rampant among the Chiang Party and Chiang army personnel, and a common saying is: "Without corruption, there is no survival." When Chen narrated the above observations, senior Chiang army generals Liao Ang, Liu Ziqi, Li Gang, Zhang Xin, etc., who laid down their arms in the previous battles in northern Shaanxi last year, and many Yan army generals and officers who laid down their arms in the Jin-Sui campaign were also present. Liao Ang told reporters: "This is enough to prove that Chiang Kai-shek's fate is deteriorating, and the current situation in Xi'an is even more dangerous than before we were liberated last year."

    西安充满悲观情绪
    【新华社晋绥二十六日电】三月一日宜川战役放下武器之前蒋军二十四旅上校参谋长陈玉武，近对记者漫谈西安印象。陈系湖南新田人，四十二岁；据称：蒋军中下级军官的斗志现较前更为低落，在西安“干部训练班”受训的校尉级军官，都装病不肯上前方部队任职。如上级来命令要去，同伴就都以这样的话送行：“你去就要准备当俘虏，请预先把你的老婆娃娃安整一下吧。”蒋贼经国主办的“青年干部队”，亦充满悲观情绪。陈玉武把南京伪国大称为“狐群狗党”，“狗打架”。他说：“我在西安亲眼看见所谓国大选举是怎么一回事”；西安商会会长张佐廷垄断全市汽车招摇过市，在汽车上贴着广告：“谁投张会长的票，免费乘车。”许多饭馆门前写着：“谁投×××一票，本馆招待吃一顿羊肉泡馍。”陈继称：“竞选是装样子的，名单早经指定了。我是公民，可是我连选举票也没有看见，当兵的就更不用说了。”陈又说：西安人民都把这些“国大代表”叫做“汽车代表”或“羊肉代表”。西安市上流行着“四大害”之说，即青年从“军”，航空大“队”，妇女协“会”，“国大”代“表”。陈又称：蒋党蒋军人员中贪污之风甚流行，一句口头禅是：“没有贪污就没有生存”。陈讲述其以上见闻时，去年在陕北历次战役中放下武器之蒋军高级将领廖昂、刘子奇、李＠岗、张新等及在晋绥战役放下武器之阎军将校多人亦均在座，廖昂对记者称：“此足证蒋介石之命运每况愈下，目前西安态势较之去年我等被解放前尤为险恶。”
