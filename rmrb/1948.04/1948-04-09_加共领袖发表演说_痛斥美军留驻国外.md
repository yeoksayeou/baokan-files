Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Ottawa Dispatch: The annual meeting of the Ontario Provincial Committee of the Labor-Progressive Party (Communist Party) of Canada closed on the 29th of last month. Canadian Communist leader Buck delivered a speech at the meeting, denouncing US imperialism's expansion, saying: "The United States has become the main danger to world peace and security. American and British troops are still stationed on the territory of non-enemy countries, and the United States and Britain are building military bases all over the world." The representatives who followed him unanimously criticized the reactionary policies of the Canadian reactionary authorities in selling themselves to US imperialism. The conference finally passed several motions, protesting the reactionary authorities' conspiracy to make the Labor-Progressive Party illegal and prohibit foreign communists from entering the country, and demanding increased pensions, wages, and the re-implementation of price controls.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. New York Dispatch: The famous French scientist, Madam Joliot-Curie, delivered a speech to nine hundred listeners at a banquet of the "Anti-Fascist Exiles Committee" here on the 1st, saying: "The current reactionary counter-current is very similar to the counter-current that led the world into the last war." But she believes that nothing can stop people's efforts to maintain peace, and she is convinced that the American people do not want to follow the example of Hitler's Germany not long ago and become an aggressor. She denounced the war propaganda made by the American press and the US imperialist policy of manufacturing atomic bombs.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. New York Dispatch: Third-Party presidential candidate Wallace, in a speech at the founding meeting of the Progressive Party of Connecticut on the evening of the 4th, criticized Truman's statement on March 29th that "the United States is now facing the same international situation as in 1941" as a serious mistake and a "sinister statement." Wallace said: Those who attempt to peddle the idea that the Soviet Union is no different from Nazi Germany are not only foolish but also sinful. He also said: If we stop this nonsense, we can live in peace with the Soviet Union. Wallace pointed out that Assistant Secretary of State Allen, the leader of the American rumor company "Voice of America," is the protector of the interests of American oil companies.

Also, Wallace's two lectures at Brooklyn College on March 29th and 31st were met with extremely enthusiastic audiences. Outside the university gate, there were hundreds of fascist hooligans attempting to make trouble, but the more than one hundred police officers present stood by and watched. However, the thugs were eventually dispersed by the indignant audience. When Wallace was giving his second speech, a veteran in military uniform presented Wallace with a silk banner signed by thousands of veterans, guaranteeing their support for Wallace.

　　加共领袖发表演说
  　痛斥美军留驻国外
    【新华社陕北六日电】渥太华讯：加拿大劳工进步党（共产党）安大略省省党部年会，已于上月二十九日闭幕。加共领袖巴克在会上发表演说，痛斥美帝扩张说：“美国已成为全世界和平与安全的主要危险。美英军队仍驻在非敌国领土上，美英两国并在全世界建筑军事基地。”继起发言的代表们，一致抨击加拿大反动当局卖身投靠美帝的反动政策。大会最后通过议案多件，抗议反动当局企图使劳工进步党非法与禁止外国共产党入境的阴谋，并要求增加养老金、工资，及再实行物价管制等。
    【新华社陕北六日电】纽约讯：法国著名科学家约里埃·居里女士一日在此间“反法西斯的流亡者委员会”宴会上，向九百听众发表演说，她说：“目前的反动逆流，和上次使世界走入大战的逆流非常相似。”但她相信，什么也不能阻止人们维护和平的努力，她确信美国人民并不想跟踪不久前的希特勒德国，作一个侵略者。她痛斥美国报界所作的战争宣传，以及美帝制造原子弹的政策。
    【新华社陕北六日电】纽约讯：第三党总统候选人华莱士，四日晚在康涅狄克州进步党成立大会上演说时，对杜鲁门三月二十九日谓“美国现正面临和一九四一年一样的国际局势”之说，斥之为严重的错误与“罪恶的声明”。华氏说：那些企图贩卖苏联和纳粹德国无异的观念的人，不仅是愚蠢的，而且是罪恶的。又说：如果我们制止了这种无稽之谈，我们便能与苏联和平相处。华氏指出：美国谣言公司“美国之声”的指导人助理国务卿阿伦，是美国石油公司利益的保护人。
    又讯：华氏于三月二十九与三十一两日在布鲁克林大学的两次讲演，听众极为热烈踊跃。在大学门外有数百名法西斯流氓，企图捣乱，到会之百余警察均袖手旁观，但暴徒终为义愤的听众所驱散。在华氏作第二次演讲时，有一着军装的退伍军人，向华氏呈一有数千退伍军人签字的锦旗，保证拥护华莱士。
