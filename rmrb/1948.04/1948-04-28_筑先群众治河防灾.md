(JiluYu News) The five rivers in Zhuxian County (i.e., Liaocheng County)—the Zhao Wang River, Yangjiao River, Zhougong River, Xinhe River, and the 50-li Shunshui Ditch—were gradually silted up due to the years of occupation and disrepair by the Japanese invaders and traitors. Every year, a lot of land was flooded. Last year, one-third of the county's land was flooded, causing serious flooding. Now, in addition to providing loans to help disaster victims engage in production, the democratic government is also actively mobilizing the masses to control the rivers to prevent future floods. Most of the county's working comrades personally mobilized and organized the county's masses to start working on blocking the rivers on April 1. Because river management is the urgent demand of the masses, the masses organized acceptance teams to inspect each other during the river excavation, and their enthusiasm was extremely high. Within eight days, except for the Zhougong River, which was not completed due to water at the bottom of the river, the remaining four rivers were repaired. In eight days, a total of more than 87,000 workdays were used, and more than 330,000 cubic meters of earth were excavated. After excavating these five rivers, the masses proposed the requirement of restoring the dikes. The masses in the first and fifth districts want to continue digging earth to fill the rivers after planting crops.

    筑先群众治河防灾
    【冀鲁豫消息】筑先县（即聊城县）的赵王河、羊角河、周公河、新河北，长五十里的顺水沟等五条河流，因日寇和汉奸数年的盘踞失修，河道逐渐淤塞，每年有很多土地被淹。去年全县被水淹的土地达三分之一，造成了严重水灾。现在民主政府除贷款扶助灾民搞生产外，并积极动员群众治河，防止以后再闹水灾。全县大部分工作同志，亲自动员与组织全县群众，于四月一日开始动工挡河。因治河是群众的迫切要求，所以在挖河中，群众组织验工队互相检验，情绪极高。在八天内除周公河因河底有水没完工外，其余四条河流均修完毕。八天中共用工八万七千多个，挖土三十三万多千方。挖完这五条河流以后，群众又提出复堤的要求，一区和五区的群众，要等种完庄稼后继续挖土填河。
