　　North University Agricultural College Livestock Epidemic Prevention Team Sets Off
    [Changzhi News] Due to the rampant livestock epidemics in recent years, the Serum Factory of the Agricultural College of North University has specially hired veterinary expert Comrade Zhao Qingsen to preside over the Serum Factory. It produced a swine fever vaccine last month and organized an epidemic prevention team of eight people. In addition to injecting the vaccine at North University, Comrades Zhao Qingsen and Hu Han led the team on the 27th of last month to the plains of Wu'an to inject epidemic prevention vaccines for farmers' livestock and eradicate swine fever. Swine fever has not occurred in villages where injections have been given, proving the vaccine is effective. Injections are currently being given in villages near Yetao. Furthermore, the Serum Factory has received support from the Border Region Government and will soon mass-produce therapeutic serum to reduce the mortality of various livestock. (Kang Xin)
