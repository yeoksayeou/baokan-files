　　The Atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's Bandits in Luoyang
　　Guan Hua, Lü E
　　From December of last year to February of this year, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Luoyang and nearby counties forcibly conscripted laborers to dig moats and construct fortifications. Regardless of wealth, age, or gender, every household in the city was required to provide one worker every other day. Even on Lunar New Year's Eve and the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, this did not stop. Every day, 10,000 people around the city were forced to labor under the whips of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Those with money hired substitutes, costing 40,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency per shift. Those without money or people sent women and children in their place. The child Li Dasuan, only thirteen years old, went to dig the moat for his father. Because he was young and weak, he was whipped by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and forced to work extra shifts at night until he collapsed from exhaustion and injury. When Luoyang was liberated, he was still lying in bed. The masses digging the moats worked in the wind and snow during the day and were locked in large temples at night, lying on the cold ground. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits did not provide food, so many people froze and starved to death. Liu from Dengfeng died from eating dirt when he was extremely hungry before the liberation of Luoyang. Yang Yin, a farmer from Dongzhang Village in northwestern Luoyang, and more than a dozen others were digging fortifications at the headquarters of the 206th Division. When the People's Liberation Army entered the city, only Yang himself was barely alive, lying on the side of the road. Three of his companions had been crushed to death when the wall collapsed, and the rest had died of cold and starvation. During the Luoyang campaign, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits increased the conscription of laborers, even grabbing middle school students to rush the construction of fortifications. Yang Hongen, a student at Luoyang Middle School, was forced to dig fortifications on the battlefield and was shot and killed.
　　In February of this year, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits forcibly ordered the demolition of residents' houses near the four gates and the railway station of Luoyang. Many people knelt before Qiu Xingxiang, begging him not to demolish or to delay the demolition, but Qiu instead ordered his troops to act together, forcibly demolishing the houses. They used straw torches dipped in gasoline or American-style oxyhydrogen blowpipes to set fire to the houses one by one. In an instant, walls collapsed, tiles fell, and flames soared into the sky, turning large areas of civilian houses into rubble. The old and weak who could not escape in time were buried in the flames. Liu Hanchen's eighty-year-old mother, who was bedridden at number 18 Xinglong Street in Dongguan, was burned to death in her bed. Many more died because their property was destroyed. Wang Wansheng, from number 52 Xinglong Street, saw his last house being demolished and said to his wife, "I'm going to be buried alive!" and then lost his mind and hanged himself. In addition to ordinary civilian houses, temples and monasteries were also demolished. The main hall of the Qingzhen Temple was also demolished. The monks of various temples had no place to live and had to stay in hotels. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits originally planned to demolish all the civilian houses in the four gates in five phases, but before the second phase was completed, the People's Liberation Army had already captured Luoyang. Even so, the four gates in the southeast, northwest, and the area around the railway station, stretching for more than ten miles and one to two hundred meters wide, had nearly ten thousand tiled houses turned to ashes.
　　The burden of exorbitant taxes and levies on the people of Luoyang was extremely heavy, including baojia tax, income tax, profit tax, conscription tax, etc., as well as temporary levies, temporary loans, temporary purchases, actual levies, actual loans, actual purchases, pre-levies, pre-loans, pre-purchases, and various temporary apportionments. Even all taxes for the coming year had already been apportioned and collected. Small and large businesses could not withstand such exploitation, and the number decreased from more than 2,400 to more than 1,000. At the end of the lunar year, almost none of them were not in debt. Baocheng Silver Shop owed as much as 200 million yuan (Chiang Kai-shek currency). Bai Wenjie, who ran a leather shop in Dongguan, jumped into a well and died because he was forced to pay exorbitant taxes. Bai Guangren, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, was forced to flee because the debts of various businesses were too large to be paid. From the Lunar New Year's Day to the liberation of Luoyang, the vast majority of businesses in the city closed their doors in protest against taxes. The Chiang Kai-shek Commissioner's Office and County Government urged them to open their businesses five times and continued to assign taxes as usual, but most businesses still refused to operate.
　　When farmers in Luoyang entered the city across the Luo River Bridge, they had to pay 10,000 yuan for each head of livestock, 30,000 yuan for a cart of manure, and 5,000 yuan for a load of urine. It was truly "never heard of manure being taxed, but now only farts are allowed to be donated for free." Small vendors suffered even more. Because Chiang Kai-shek currency was constantly depreciating, Chiang Kai-shek currency with a face value of less than 5,000 yuan was no longer circulating in the market, and the small vendors' income was mostly in small denominations, thus becoming waste paper. Chiang Kai-shek's troops, using the excuse that the chamber of commerce and baojia were embezzling taxes, directly sent troops to extort money. The chamber of commerce and baojia did not recognize this and demanded taxes as usual, resulting in the citizens having to bear a double burden. One of the methods used by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to conscript soldiers was to search for "identification cards" under the pretext of checking "identification cards" late at night, and then arrest the soldiers two days later. It is impossible to count the various forms of extortion, such as eating in restaurants without paying. Two folk songs were popular in Luoyang: "The Youth Army, with black hearts, demolishes houses, flattens old graves, demands donations, forces people to death"; "When the Central Army arrives in Luoyang, the people suffer, grabbing soldiers, apportioning taxes, demanding military rations, and when officials push too hard, the people will revolt." It is no wonder that Luoyang had not yet been liberated when the people of Luoyang wrote slogans on the collapsed walls: "Down with the 206th Division, support Chairman Mao." And the active assistance of the people of Luoyang to the People's Liberation Army was rare in other places.

　　洛阳蒋匪暴行
    关桦　履鄂
    自去年十二月到今年二月，蒋匪在洛阳及附近各县强征民夫挖掘城壕、工事，城内居民不论贫富老幼每户隔日就要摊派一工，就是去年旧历除夕和大年初五也没有停歇。城周每天都有一万人民在蒋匪鞭笞下被迫劳动，有钱的雇人代替，一个工要花四万蒋币，没钱没人的则以妇女小孩顶替。儿童李大蒜才十三岁，就替他父亲去挖壕，因年少力弱，遭蒋匪鞭打，强迫在夜里补挖，直到力竭受伤躺倒，洛阳解放时，他还躺在床上。挖壕群众白天在风雪里劳作，晚上被关在大庙里，躺在冰冷的地上，蒋匪又不供伙食，因此，许多人冻饿毙命，登封刘某即在洛阳解放前饿极吃土而死。洛阳西北东张庄农民杨银之等十几人，在二○六师师部挖工事，当解放军进城时，仅剩杨本人奄奄一息、倒卧路旁，他的同伴已有三个人因墙坍倒被砸死，其余也已冻饿死去。洛阳战役中蒋匪更增抓民夫，甚至连中学生也抓来赶修工事，洛阳中学学生杨鸿恩被迫在战场上挖工事中弹毙命。
    今年二月蒋匪强令拆毁洛阳四关及车站附近居民房屋，许多群众跪在邱匪行湘面前要求不拆或缓拆，而邱匪却反而命令所部一齐动手，强行拆毁，并以草把蘸汽油或以美式氢氧吹管挨户点火，……一时墙倒瓦塌，烈焰冲天，大片民房，顿成瓦砾。老弱不及逃出者即葬身火焰。东关兴隆街十八号刘汉臣的八十多岁老母，因卧病被死在床上；因家产被毁而致死者更多。兴隆街五二号王万生看见自己最后一间房子被拆时，对妻子说了一句：“活埋我了！”即神经失常，上吊而死。除一般民房外，寺院庙宇也被拆毁，清真增的大殿也被拆了。各寺和尚无庙可住，只得去住旅馆。蒋匪本拟分五期将四关民房全部拆光，但第二期还没有完成，解放军就已打下洛阳了。就是这样，已经使东南西北四关及车站四周连绵十余里，宽一二百米，近万幢的瓦房成为灰烬。
    洛阳人民苛捐杂税的负担是奇重的，有保甲捐、所得税、利得税、壮丁捐………等，又有暂征、暂借、暂购，实征、实借、实购，预征、预借、预购，还有各种临时摊派，连明年的一切税收也都已摊派征收了。大小商号经不起这样的压榨，从两千四百余家减少到一千余家。阴历年关结算时，几乎无一家不欠款缺款，宝成银楼欠款达二亿元（蒋币下同）。东关开皮行的白文杰为损税所逼跳井而死。商会会长白光仁则因各商号欠款太多无法上缴，被逼逃亡。今年旧历元旦到洛阳解放前，市内绝大多数商号闭门抗捐，蒋匪专署县府曾五次催促开市，并照常派款要税，但大多数商号仍拒不营业。
    洛阳农民进城过洛河桥时，每头牲口须纳款一万元，一车大粪得出税三万元，一担尿也要出五千元，这真是“自古未闻粪有税，而今只许屁无捐”了。小商贩吃亏更大，因蒋币不断贬值，票面五千元以下之蒋币市上已不流通，小贩营业所得多系小票，因而变成废纸。蒋匪军借口商会保甲收税捐要舞弊乃直接派兵勒索，商会保甲对此又不承认，照例再要，结果市民须出双重负担。蒋匪抓丁办法之一，系于深夜借检查“身份证”为名，将壮丁之“身份证”搜去，等再过两日索而加以抓捕。他们吃了馆子不付钱等变相勒索，更是无法统计。洛阳流行着两首民谣：“青年军，黑良心，扒房子，平老坟，要捐款，逼死人”；“中央军到洛阳，老百姓遭了殃，抓丁派款要军粮，官逼太急民要反”。这就无怪洛阳还没有解放，洛阳人民就在倒塌的墙上写了：“打倒二○六师，拥护毛主席”的标语，而洛阳人民对解放军的积极协助是各地罕见的。
