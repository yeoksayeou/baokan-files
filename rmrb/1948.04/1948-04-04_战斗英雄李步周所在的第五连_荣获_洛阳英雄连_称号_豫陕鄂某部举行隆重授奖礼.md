Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 2nd: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army recently held a grand ceremony to award the Fifth Company, the company of combat hero Li Buzhou and one of the main attacking forces in the Luoyang liberation campaign, with the glorious title of "Luoyang Heroic Company". The company demonstrated extreme determination, resourcefulness, bravery, and excellent urban discipline in this battle; forty-two members of the company were awarded individual Special Merits and Major Merits, and four others were selected as combat heroes in the style of Li Buzhou. Li Buzhou himself was awarded a Special Merit once. The company's original plan for this year was to annihilate one enemy battalion, and in the Battle of Luoyang alone, it captured 190 enemy soldiers, seized 24 light and heavy machine guns, and 105 rifles and submachine guns, completing nearly half of its annual plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 2nd: The Fifth Company, where combat hero Li Buzhou serves, is the first company in the Chen-Xie army to receive the title of "Heroic Company." They are well-deserved of this glorious title. From the first battle of the revolutionary war to the recent Battle of Luoyang, they have earned praise for their brilliant achievements and outstanding discipline in every engagement. In the battle of Xiaochao in Wenxi, which annihilated the 31st Brigade in July of the year before last, the Fifth Company launched a strong attack on the enemy's last stronghold in broad daylight and without fire cover. Combat hero Gao Qinian and his comrades fought hand-to-hand with the enemy on and off the city walls, while combat hero Li Buzhou and his companions charged into the stronghold from the flank, capturing 170 enemy soldiers and ultimately annihilating the 90th Regiment of the 31st Brigade. In the battle of Motou Station on the periphery of Zhao City during the Datong-Puzhou Campaign, the company took on the most difficult direction of attack. With swift and concealed movements, they crossed the enemy's three-sided crossfire, reaching the enemy before they could resist and annihilating them. In the Battle of Luohe during the Pinghan Campaign, the company demonstrated astonishing ingenuity and resourcefulness by infiltrating the Dongguan without firing a shot and capturing more than 300 enemy soldiers. They then charged into the city to eliminate the remaining enemies, capturing a total of 530 enemy soldiers in the entire battle, with no casualties in the entire company, creating an unprecedented record of glory. Their bravery and tenacity were not only demonstrated in offense but also in defense. In the battle of Xili in Lüliang, the entire company defended a hilltop position where it was impossible to build fortifications, repelling the attacks of an enemy four times its size and with superior firepower seven times in a row under extremely difficult conditions. In the Battle of Beiguan in Yuncheng, southern Shanxi, the company was ordered to defend a blockhouse and field position 150 meters outside the city. The enemy bombarded them with various heavy weapons, with nearly 2,000 shells of various types exploding on the position every day. However, they calmly built fortifications and held their ground for three days and two nights, successfully completing their mission.

In the recent Battle of Luoyang, the Fifth Company highly carried forward its heroic history and glorious tradition. When the enemy defenders inside the city relied on complex fortifications to block the bridgehead with three-sided firepower, preventing the attacking troops from approaching the city walls, the Fifth Company was ordered to launch a strong attack. The brave soldiers of the entire company braved the enemy's intense fire and rushed straight to the city walls. The comrades in front fell wounded on the bridge, and those behind leaped over them, broke through the chevaux-de-frise, barbed wire, and minefields, and blew open the city walls. The deputy company commander, seriously injured, still lay in the mud and threw grenades at the enemy. Machine gunner Fan Xitang, with a serious face injury that prevented him from speaking, still insisted on not retreating. The soldiers who occupied the outer city circle attacked the enemy on three sides with a small number of people, and the wounded also bandaged themselves up and continued to fight, finally opening the way to liberate Luoyang.

The Fifth Company is also a model of executing mass discipline and battlefield discipline. In the Battle of Xiaochao, the enemy's luggage and backpacks were scattered all over the ground, and the soldiers collected them and handed them all over to the public, distributing them to the prisoners. After the liberation of Luoyang this time, enemy fortifications and the streets were filled with enemy soldiers' clothes, quilts, bundles, and other items, but no one in the entire company touched them. Soldier Wang Yinsheng's clothes were covered in dung during the siege, and Song Bin's shoes were torn, but they never used any of the captured items. During the garrison period in the city, no one in the entire company took even the smallest war trophy. Soldier Ma Shuangtang said, "We don't want anything, what we want is to strive to be meritorious citizens and heroes, not to compete for foreign wealth." This sentence fully reflects the political consciousness and disciplinary concept of all the commanders and fighters, and embodies the noble qualities of the people's army.

The Fifth Company continuously emerges with heroic models. In the past year and a half, the Fifth Company has cultivated countless outstanding figures like Li Buzhou, Guan Huaibao, Fu Lizhi, Huo Shouju, Li Zhihua, Wang Yinsheng, and Li Jing. They emerged from the company in batches, and the company in turn cultivated new heroes and models from the masses through them, constantly adding new brilliance and heroic deeds. This is why the Fifth Company finally became a heroic company.

　　战斗英雄李步周所在的第五连
  　荣获“洛阳英雄连”称号
    豫陕鄂某部举行隆重授奖礼
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二日电】解放军某部近举行隆重典礼，以“洛阳英雄连”的光荣称号，授予解放洛阳战役中担任主攻之一的战斗英雄李步周所在连第五连。该连在此次战役中表现了极度的坚决机智英勇与出色的城市纪律；该连有四十二人被记个人特功与大功，另有四人被选为李步周式的战斗英雄，李步周本人则被记特功一次。该连今年原订计划歼敌一个营，此次洛阳一战即俘敌一百九十名、缴轻重机枪二十四挺、步枪及手提机枪一百零五支，完成全年计划近半。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二日电】战斗英雄李步周所在的第五连，是陈谢大军中第一个获得“英雄连”称号的连队。这一光荣称号，他们是当之无愧的。从革命战争开始的第一仗到最近的洛阳战役每次都因光辉战绩和出色纪律赢得了表扬。前年七月消灭三十一旅的闻喜下晁战斗中，在白昼和缺乏火力掩护的条件下，五连强攻敌人最后的据点，战斗英雄高其年和他的战友在城头上下跟敌人拼刺刀，战斗英雄李步周和他的同伴则从侧翼冲进据点俘敌一百七十名，最后消灭了三十一旅的九十团。在同蒲战役的赵城外围战中，该连主攻磨头车站最难打的方向，他们以神速隐蔽的行动越过敌三面交叉火网，一直摸到敌人跟前，敌人未及抵抗即被歼灭。平汉战役解放漯河之战，该连更以惊人的巧妙和机智，未发一弹摸进东关俘敌三百多名，后又冲入城内解决残敌，在整个战斗中共俘敌五百三十名，全连无一伤亡，创造了空前的光辉纪录。他们这种英勇顽强不但表现在进攻上，也表现在防御上。在吕梁习里战斗中，全连固守无法构筑工事的山头阵地，在极端困难条件下连续七次击退四倍于己且有优势火力之敌的进攻。在晋南运城北关之战中，该连奉命坚守城外一百五十米处的碉堡和野外阵地，敌人以各种重火器猛轰，每天有近两千发各种炮弹在阵地上爆炸，但他们沉着构筑工事，在弹雨中坚守三昼两夜，胜利完成任务。
    在这次洛阳之战中，第五连高度地发扬了它的英雄历史和光荣传统。当城内守敌凭借复杂的工事，以三面的火力封锁桥头，使进攻部队无法接近城垣时，第五连奉命强攻，全连勇士们冒着敌人炽烈火力，直扑城垣。前面的战友在桥上带彩卧倒，后面的一跃而过，冲破拒马铁丝网与地雷阵，炸开了城墙。副连长受了重伤还躺在泥泞中向敌人打手榴弹，机枪手范西堂脸上受了重伤说不出话来仍坚持不退。占领外城圈的战士们以少数人猛攻三方面的敌人，伤员们也包扎起来继续战斗，终于打开了解放洛阳城的大道。
    第五连又是执行群众纪律和战场纪律的模范。在下晁战斗中，敌人的行李背包遗弃满地，战士们将它收集起来全部交公，分给俘虏使用。而此次洛阳解放后，敌人工事和大街上到处堆满了敌军的衣服、被子、包袱等什物，全连没有一人动它一下。战士王银生的衣服在攻城时沾满了大粪，宋斌的鞋子弄破了，但他们始终没去动用缴获的物品。在城内驻防期间，全连没有一个人拿过一件最微小的战利品，战士马双堂说：“我们什么也不要，我们要的是争功臣，争英雄，不是争洋财”。这句话充分反映了全体指战员的政治自觉和纪律观念，体现了人民军队的崇高品质。
    第五连不断涌现英雄模范，一年半以来，五连所培养出来的象李步周、关怀保、傅立志、霍守举、李志华、王银生、李晶那样出色的人物，是一下数不清的。他们一批批由连队中涌现出来，连队又通过他们从群众中培育出新的英雄和模范，不断地增添新的光辉和英勇的事迹。这就是为什么第五连最后终于成了英雄的连队。
