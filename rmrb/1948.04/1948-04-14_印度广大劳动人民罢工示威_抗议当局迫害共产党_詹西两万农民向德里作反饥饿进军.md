Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th—According to a TASS dispatch from Delhi: On March 27th, the Indian authorities implemented a nationwide anti-communist and anti-democratic movement, declaring the Communist Party of India an illegal organization and carrying out massive arrests of democrats across the country. This action has aroused extreme indignation among the working people of India. In Calcutta, 17,000 government employees, disregarding the authorities' threats of "dismissal," began a hunger strike and sit-down strike on the 2nd. Despite arrests and intimidation by the authorities, they have stubbornly persisted to this day. The protest movement has been expanding daily. Following the protest of 150,000 workers in Bombay on the 4th, workers in Agra, Bezwada, Coimbatore, and other places in the United Provinces have recently begun strikes. A group of faculty members at Allahabad University held a meeting on the 6th and issued a statement denouncing the authorities' atrocities in persecuting the Communist Party of India and trade union leaders. On the 8th, 20,000 miners in Kolar went on strike to protest the authorities' measures to persecute the Communist Party of India. Twenty-two arrested members of the Communist Party of India in Delhi prisons also launched a hunger strike protest. On the same day, 20,000 farmers from Jhansi marched on Delhi in an anti-hunger campaign. The All India Kisan Sabha also resolved to complain to Nehru about the authorities' illegal actions in seizing farmers' land. The striking masses distributed leaflets exposing the fascist nature of the authorities. It is reliably learned that of those arrested in connection with the assassination of Gandhi, members of the Indian fascist military organization "Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh," 17 were released in Punjab alone on the 3rd. The Central Committee of the Trade Union Council of West Bombay Province pointed out in a protest resolution passed on the 6th: "The purpose of the government's large-scale persecution is to suppress the people's freedom of rights and all opposition factions in the government, including parliamentary opposition."

In the past half month, the Indian police have successively searched the headquarters of the Communist Party of India and the addresses of democratic organizations affiliated with the All India Trade Union Congress; and forcibly arrested over a hundred members of the Communist Party of India and trade union members, including the Chairman of the All India Trade Union Congress and Indian representative to the World Federation of Trade Unions, Dange, one of the leaders of the Indian Trade Union Congress, Mirajkar, and the Secretary of the Bombay Railway Workers' Union, Ladzina, and ordered the arrest of former General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, Joshi, the current General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, Randive, and the editor of the Communist Party of India's weekly magazine, "People's Age," Edgarly, and others. So far, large-scale arrests are continuing in cities such as Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, Madras, and Pune.

　　印度广大劳动人民罢工示威
  　抗议当局迫害共产党
  　詹西两万农民向德里作反饥饿进军
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合塔斯社德里讯：印度当局于上月二十七日实行全国性的反共反民主运动，宣布印度共产党为非法组织，并在全国大肆逮捕民主人士。此举已引起全印劳动人民的桥端愤慨。加尔各答一万七千名政府机关公务员不顾当局“解职”的要挟，自二日开始绝食静坐罢工，虽经当局逮捕恫吓，但至今仍顽强坚持中。抗议运动已日益扩大，紧接着孟买十五万劳动群众四日的抗议，联合省的亚格拉、别兹瓦达、科姆巴托尔等地工人，已于最近开始罢工。阿拉哈巴德大学一批教职员六日集会发表声明，痛斥当局迫害印共及职工会领袖之暴行。八日更有科拉两万名矿工实行罢工，抗议当局迫害印共的措施，德里监狱二十二名被捕印共党员亦发动绝食抗议运动。同日，詹西两万农民向德里作反饥饿进军，全印农民大会并曾决议向尼赫鲁控告当局夺取农民土地之非法行动。罢工群众散发传单，揭露当局法西斯化的面目。据确悉，因与暗杀甘地有关的印度法西斯军人组织“拉斯达、沙瓦尚”被捕分子，仅三日在旁遮普一地，即有十七名被释放。西孟买省职工会中央委员会于六日所通过的抗议决议中指出：“政府大规模迫害的目的，在于压制人民自由权利，及政府中的一切反对派，包括议会反对派在内”。
    近半月来，印度宪警相继搜查印共总部及全印总工会所属民主团体会址；并强行捕去印共领袖之一——全印职工会主席兼世职印度代表——丹吉、印度职工大会领袖之一密拉泽卡、孟买铁路工会书记莱泽纳以下百余名印共党员及职工会会员，并下令逮捕前印共总书记约希、现任印共总书记蓝狄夫、印共机关周刊——人民世纪——编辑艾德加利等人。迄今为止，加尔各答、德里、孟买、马德拉斯、浦那等城，仍在继续大肆逮捕。
