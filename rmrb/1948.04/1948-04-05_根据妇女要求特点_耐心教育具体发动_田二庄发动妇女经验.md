　　According to Women's Demands and Characteristics
    Patient Education and Specific Mobilization
    The Experience of Mobilizing Women in Tian Erzhuang
    [Our News] There are 111 women in Tian Erzhuang, including 30 poor peasant women and 47 middle peasant women. Among them, 22 poor peasant women and 26 middle peasant women have been organized. When we first arrived in Tian Erzhuang, we only focused on mobilizing poor and hired (male) peasants and did not make mobilizing and organizing women one of our main tasks. Only after the poor peasants had been partially mobilized and organized did we pay attention to this issue. After half a month of work, we initially organized the women. The women in this village have the following three characteristics:
    (1) Women suffer more pain and oppression than male peasants.
    (2) There are many cases of sexual promiscuity between men and women, mainly due to the following two reasons: First, they are forced by poverty. For example, Wei ××, a lower-middle peasant woman in this village, was unable to survive during the years of famine. In order to get some rice to eat, she had a relationship with Zhang ××, the village chief at the time. She said, "If we weren't so hungry, who would do this kind of thing?" Second, it is the result of feudal arranged marriages.
    (3) They do not know much about the affairs of the village. In the past, women were still confined at home and rarely participated in general village activities, which objectively made them "backward."
    Therefore, in addition to the same political and economic demands as the male peasants, the women of Tian Erzhuang also urgently demand women's democratic rights: freedom of marriage and equality between men and women.
    In the process of mobilizing women, we first broke through the phenomenon of "following the crowd." For example, one woman said to another, "I can't say anything. If they call me, I can't refuse to go. But after going, I didn't dare to say a word all afternoon." We paid attention to strengthening education and inspiring their consciousness and autonomy. (2) Approaching the masses, we discovered that the biggest obstacle in their thinking was fear of retaliation from the cadres. After our encouragement and education, their confidence gradually increased, and they changed from simply complaining to us to taking action at meetings, daring to tell more people about their grievances. (3) They have a strong sense of inferiority when it comes to sexual promiscuity, so they also lack the courage to express their opinions. For example, Liu ××, an old middle peasant widow, had a relationship with a peasant before. Later, Duan Kuishan, the village public security officer, had a personal feud with her and falsely accused her, hanging her up and beating her severely, and mobilizing all the women in the village to beat her. This time she wanted to vent her anger, but she didn't dare to express her opinion. We encouraged her to rely on the poor and complain to the poor, but she repeatedly said, "Dare I say it? I used to have problems, and I feel guilty." We guided them to discuss the issue at meetings. Liu ×× herself pointed out that she had problems because she was abused due to lack of freedom of marriage. After discussion, they had a correct understanding of the issue, improved their class consciousness, gradually overcame their inferiority complex, and demanded to start anew. Zhang ××, who was relatively promiscuous, solemnly expressed her determination to reform when she joined the farmers' association. (4) Resolving conflicts through unity education. When connecting with poor and hired women, one woman had a personal feud with another woman, and she said, "If she joins the poor peasant group, I won't join." Another woman, hearing this, also said, "If she's there, I won't go." When the women were first organized, they were constantly entangled in these issues. We conducted "one family" unity education at the meetings. On the one hand, through activists, we talked to them and used their specific events to conduct "one family resolving conflicts, not creating conflicts" education, inspiring their class friendship. Afterwards, they all voluntarily came to talk to us, feeling that they were wrong. At one meeting, they said, "If we have something to say in the future, we'll talk about it at the meeting. Isn't the meeting supposed to be for us to express our opinions! Don't go gossiping after the meeting." They also consciously formulated disciplines: 1. No emotional outbursts. 2. No grudges, no mutual conflicts. 3. Speak up at the meeting, don't talk nonsense after the meeting. 4. Open up to each other, no mutual cover-ups. 5. Don't talk about meeting matters to outsiders. This shows that women can gradually overcome their weaknesses by participating in social activities and having a normal meeting life. (5) After the women were organized, they felt that they were not capable. They said, "We can't say anything, we don't know where to start." The work team educated them, telling them that being calm, upright, enthusiastic, and selfless can do good things for the masses, speaking from the heart and telling the truth will do. We paid special attention to training them in action. In discussing the issue of cadre self-reflection and the method of returning fruits of labor, and through the issue of farmer association members, it was shown that they were very concerned about these issues, spoke enthusiastically, and their opinions were generally very correct. At this time, the women's "following the crowd" mentality gradually decreased, and they began to actively participate.
    The education the masses gave us: 1. Taking the narrow "poor and hired peasant line" as the "class line," we were relatively cold to middle peasant women, approached them less, and simply stayed within the circle of poor and hired peasants. 2. Having an incorrect attitude towards women's shortcomings, such as disliking or even hating individual selfish women, lacking a class-sympathetic attitude, also hindered our work in approaching and transforming them. 3. Not being patient enough with women's work, but being too hasty, lacking guidance and inspiration, and not trusting them enough, which led to paternalism.

　　根据妇女要求特点
    耐心教育具体发动
    田二庄发动妇女经验
    【本报消息】田二庄妇女共一百十一人，内贫农妇女三十人，中农妇女四十七人，已组织起来的贫农妇女有二十二人，中农妇女二十六人。我们初到田二庄，只注意发动贫雇（男），没有把发动与组织妇女做为主要工作之一。当贫农已部分发动组织起来后，才注意到这个问题，经过半个月的工作，才初步把妇女组织起来，这村妇女有以下三个特点：
    （一）妇女所受的痛苦与压迫，比农民更多一层。
    （二）男女间性乱的不少，主要有以下两种原因：一是被生活贫困所迫，如本村下中农妇女魏××，灾荒年时无法生活，为了换点米吃，与当时村长张××发生关系，她说：“咱要不是饿得没法，谁干这个事？”二是封建买卖婚姻造成的结果。
    （三）对村中的事了解不多，过去妇女仍然被关在家里，很少参加村中一般的活动，客观上造成她们“落后”。
    因之田二庄的妇女，除了有与农民同样的政治上与经济上要求外，还迫切要求妇女的民主权利：婚姻自由与男女平等。
    在发动妇女的过程中，首先突破“随大流”的现象。如一个妇女对别人说：“咱不会说啥，人家叫了咱，也不能不去，去了咱一后晌也没敢吭”，我们注意了加强教育，启发其自觉自主。（２）接近群众中发现她们思想上最大的障碍，是怕干部报复。经过我们的鼓励教育逐渐提高她们信心，这样她们便由单纯的向我们诉苦，转为在会议上的行动，敢于对更多的人谈出自己的冤屈。（３）在性乱问题上她们的自卑心理很重，因此她们也缺乏提出意见的勇气。如老中农寡妇刘××，前曾与一农民有过关系，后本村公安员段魁山，与她家有私人仇恨诬陷她，将她吊起毒打，并动员全村妇女动手打。这次她想出气，但不敢提出意见，我们鼓励她依靠穷人，向穷人诉苦，但是她再三的说：“咱敢提吗？咱从前有过毛病，咱觉着理短。”我们引导她们在会议上进行讨论，刘××自己提出是因为婚姻不自由受虐待才发生毛病。经过讨论，使她们对这问题有了正确的认识，提高她们的阶级觉悟，逐渐克服了自卑心理，要求重新做人，较为性乱的张××进农会时，她沉痛的表示要决心改过。（４）解圪＠进行团结教育。串连贫雇妇女时，有一妇女和另一妇女有私人仇气，她就说：“她参加贫农团，咱就不在”，另一个听到这话后，也说：“有她在，咱就不去。”在刚组织起妇女的时候，一直都在这些问题上纠缠不清，我们在会议上进行“一家人”的团结教育，一方面通过积极分子，和她们谈话，以她们的具体事件，进行“一家人解圪＠，不能结圪＠”的教育，启发她们的阶级友爱，事后她们都自动的找我们谈，觉得自己不对。在一次会议中，她们说：“以后有事，在会上谈，开会就是叫咱提意见吗！别又到会下去倒闲话。”她们又自觉的订出了纪律：一、不能起态度。二、不准记仇，不准互相结圪＠。三、有话会上说，会后不乱说。四、打开情面，不互相包庇。五、会里事，不对会外人谈。这说明妇女参加了社会活动，有了正常的会议生活，是可以逐渐克服那些弱点的。（５）妇女组织起来后，她们就感到自己没有能力，她们说：“咱不会吭，摸不着大头小尾”。工作组就进行教育，告诉他们，老气、正派、热心、大公无私，就能为群众办好事，说心理话，说直理就成，特别注意在行动中锻炼她们。在讨论干部反省的问题，退果实的办法，通过农会会员的问题中，表现出她们对这些问题很关心，发言也热烈，意见一般很正确。到这时妇女们“随大流”的思想逐渐减少，开始积极活动起来。
    群众给我们的教育：一、把狭隘的“贫雇路线”“当做阶级路线”，对中农妇女较冷淡，接近她们少，只单纯的在贫雇圈子里转。二、不正确的态度，对待妇女的缺点，如对个别的较自私的妇女，看不惯，甚至讨厌，缺少阶级同情的态度，也妨碍了我们接近她与改造她的工作。三、对妇女工作不够耐心等待，而操之过急，缺乏诱导与启示，信任她们不够，形成了包办代替。
