　　Gleanings from the Chiang Kai-shek Area
    ▲Qingdao Dispatch: Sun Xiaofeng, a clerk in the Chiang bandit Social Affairs Bureau's Document Section, was laid off and unemployed before the end of last year. He lived by pawning and borrowing. After the Lunar New Year, he even sold the cotton quilt he used for sleeping and ate the money. His wife, unable to bear the cold and hunger, left him. Sun, in anguish over his hunger and the loss of his wife, hanged himself in the staff dormitory of the bandit Social Affairs Bureau.
    ▲Chengdu Dispatch: Shi Ce, formerly a lieutenant general and senior advisor to the Chiang bandit Sichuan-Kangding Pacification Headquarters, is 68 years old. After the victory against Japan, Chiang's bandits squeezed out non-direct line troops, and he lost his job. With the high cost of living, his wife and children left him, and he was reduced to being a petty thief. On February 25th, he was arrested for breaking into a residence in Caojia Lane, Outer North, to steal clothes and blankets hung out to dry. When he was released, he was still shedding tears and muttering the line, "Where can I go in this vast world?"
    ▲Changsha Dispatch: Amidst the grain shortage in Changsha, a tragic incident occurred while purchasing rice. At the beginning of last month, in front of the Tanggong Temple grain purchasing station in the city, a pregnant woman was knocked down while buying rice and was trampled to death, bleeding profusely on the spot. The scene was extremely tragic.
    ▲Northern Shaanxi Dispatch: Recently, someone in the isolated city of Yulin, occupied by Chiang's bandits, described the Chiang bandit bureaucrats as: "Aspiring to dine on the flesh of the poor, laughing and talking while drinking the blood of the peasants." This fully depicts the ferocious features of the Chiang family's fascist bandits.
