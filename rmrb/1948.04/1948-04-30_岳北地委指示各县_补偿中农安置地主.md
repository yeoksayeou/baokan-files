    Yuebei District Party Committee Instructs All Counties to Compensate Middle Peasants and Resettle Landlords
    [Taiyue News] The Yuebei District Party Committee, based on the situation in the entire sub-region, instructed all counties on the 20th, saying: Since last autumn, due to the unprincipled emphasis on the "poor peasant line" in autumn land cultivation and loans, as well as the impurity of the poor peasant league organization and its chaotic struggle against and control of middle peasants, coupled with the misunderstandings and suspicions caused by the propaganda of egalitarian policies, mass unrest has been created, which has greatly hindered production. In order to immediately correct left-leaning deviations and promote production, the District Party Committee hereby puts forward the following opinions: (1) It is necessary to concentrate all efforts to grasp and lead spring plowing. Even in land reform experimental villages, when spring plowing is tense, it should be obeyed, and spring plowing cannot be put aside to do its own thing. (2) The issue of middle peasants is no longer a general propaganda issue. Deviations that infringe upon the interests of middle peasants must be corrected immediately, and problems must be resolved. The property of middle peasants that has been struggled against but not distributed since last winter must be returned in full. If it has been distributed and cannot be returned, they should immediately be compensated with items for production. Middle peasants who have been subjected to control should be released unconditionally; those who have had their doors sealed should have them opened immediately; those who have been forced to lend money to poor peasants should have it returned unconditionally; those who have been deprived of their civil rights should have them restored immediately; they should be allowed to participate in peasant associations and mutual aid groups, and they can also participate in leadership. Leaders must dare to openly admit their mistakes and should not push them all onto village cadres or poor peasants. (3) However, attention should be paid to educating poor peasants who are discouraged and dissatisfied when resolving the issue of middle peasants. (4) Landlords and rich peasants who have been swept out of their homes should also be resettled and given necessary items to enable them to produce. They can also participate in mutual aid groups. The stupid method of rejecting them from the production circle is wrong. (5) Village cadres and rural party members should generally adopt a transformation policy, and leaders should educate them to lead production.

    岳北地委指示各县
    补偿中农安置地主
    【太岳消息】岳北地委根据全分区情形，于二十日指示各县说：自去年秋天以来，由于在秋垡地和贷款中，无原则的强调“贫雇路线”，以及贫农团组织的不纯，乱向中农斗争和管制，加以平分政策宣传以来，引起的各种误解怀疑，造成了群众不安，大大妨碍了生产。为了立即纠正左倾偏向，开展生产，地委特提出这样的意见：（一）必须集中全力抓紧领导春耕，就是土改实验村，春耕紧张时，也应服从春耕，不能把春耕放在一边，自搞一套。（二）对中农问题已不是一般的宣传问题，应立即纠正侵犯中农利益的偏向，解决问题。去冬以来已斗未分的中农财物，必须全部退还，实在分了无法退的，也应马上补给他们以生产的东西。中农被管制的，一律释放；被封门的，一律开门；强迫中农借款给贫农的，应无条件的退还；被褫夺公民权的，立即恢复；应允许他们参加农会和互助组，并可参加领导。领导上要敢于公开承认错误，不应都推到村干部或贫雇身上。（三）但要注意在解决中农问题时，对贫雇农的泄气不满给以教育。（四）对扫地出门的地主富农，也应安置，给以必要的东西，使他们能够生产，还可让他参加互助组，把他们拒绝在生产圈外的愚蠢的办法是不对的。（五）村干部和农村党员，一般的采取改造方针，领导上应教育他们领导生产。
