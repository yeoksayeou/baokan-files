Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Rome dispatch: As a result of Gasperi's traitorous and dictatorial policies, the living conditions of the Italian working people are deteriorating, and the strike movement has erupted again. Italian printing workers across the country began a major strike on the 19th, demanding a 34% wage increase, and declared: they will not stop until their goal is achieved. As a result of the printing workers' strike, Italian-language newspapers cannot be seen in Italy. On the 26th, striking workers angrily confiscated and burned 18,000 copies of the "Osservatore Romano," an organ newspaper published by the Vatican reactionaries using their privileges during the strike. On the 18th of this month, 1,000 key employees of the "Auditor's Office" managing the national treasury went on strike. This month's strikes have also affected postal and telephone employees, Milan bank employees, and tax bureau employees. General strikes have also occurred in Benevento (central Italy), Urbino (central Italy), Savona (northern Italy) and other places. Furthermore, the Italian Bank Employees Union has decided to launch a national general strike starting on the 30th of this month, demanding the re-establishment of the social insurance system and increased wages.

　　意大利罢工又起
    全国没有报纸看
    【新华社陕北三十日电】罗马讯：由于加斯贝利卖国独裁政策的结果，意劳动人民生活越益恶化，罢工运动又勃然而起。意全国印刷工人于十九日开始大罢工，要求增资百分之三十四，并宣称：不达目的不止。印刷工人罢工结果，使意大利看不到意文报章。二十六日，罢工工人愤而将梵蒂冈反动派利用其特权在罢工期间出版的机关报“罗马观察报”一万八千份，加以没收及焚毁。本月十八日，管理国库的“会计厅”主要雇员一千人举行罢工。本月份的罢工并波及到邮政及电话雇员，米兰银行职员及税局雇员等。贝纳凡托（意中）、尔滨洛（意中）、萨窝那（意北）等地且发生总罢工。又讯：意银行职工会已决定于本月三十日起举行全国总罢工，要求重新制订社会保险制度及增加工资。
