Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 30th: Nanjing Dispatch: The Chiang Kai-shek clique's "State Council" passed the "Measures for Selling State-Run Enterprises to Replenish Issuance Reserves" on the 26th. The scope of the sale includes: (1) 50% of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shares; (2) 70% of the "official shares" of the China Textile Industries Corporation (originally 60% of the company's shares were "official shares," and 40% were "commercial shares" belonging to the Song family); (3) Enterprises under the Chiang Kai-shek clique's National Resources Commission worth 50 million US dollars; (4) The remaining unsold portion of the enemy and puppet assets seized by the Chiang Kai-shek clique; (5) The portion of Japanese reparations materials that the Chiang Kai-shek clique originally stipulated to be "sold to private enterprises" (accounting for 25% of all Japanese reparations). The measures stipulate that the sale will be in the form of shares, valued in US dollars; foreign news agencies estimate its total value to be approximately 300 to 400 million US dollars. It is widely believed that this move by the Chiang Kai-shek clique is a reflection of the extreme deterioration of its financial crisis. Because Chiang currency is constantly depreciating and the people regard it as waste paper, they have come up with this trick in a vain attempt to fool the people in the Chiang-controlled areas. The so-called 300 to 400 million US dollars as "issuance reserves" is meaningless under the Chiang Kai-shek clique's non-redeemable paper money system. This only means that the Chiang Kai-shek clique will more frantically issue Chiang currency, squeezing the blood and sweat of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to supply its counter-revolutionary civil war consumption. Another attempt of this move is to transform the "state-run enterprises" controlled by the four major families into the "legal" private property of the four major families, because private industrialists and businessmen in the Chiang-controlled areas are currently unable to survive under the oppression, damage, or restrictions of the four major families, and they absolutely cannot come up with such a large amount of US dollars to purchase "state-run enterprises."

　　蒋匪财政情况更恶化
  　出卖“国营事业”
    【新华社陕北三十日电】南京讯：蒋匪“国务会议”已于二十六日通过“出售国营事业充实发行准备办法”，出售范围包括：（一）招商局股票百分之五十；（二）中纺公司“官股”百分之七十（按该公司原来百分之六十为“官股”，百分之四十为宋家族的“商股”）；（三）价值五千万美金之蒋匪资委会所属事业；（四）蒋匪接收敌伪资产未售出之剩余部分；（五）日本赔偿物资中蒋匪原规定“出售民营”部分（占全部日本赔偿物百分之二十五）。办法规定将以股票形式出售，用美金计值；外国通讯社估计其总值约为三亿至四亿美元。众信蒋匪此举系其财政危机极度恶化的反映。由于蒋币不断贬值，人民视为废纸，因而想出这一妄图愚弄蒋区人民的骗术。而所谓以三亿至四亿美元作为“发行准备”，在蒋匪不兑现纸币制度下实毫无意义，这仅仅意味着蒋匪将更加疯狂地滥发蒋币，榨取蒋区人民血汗，供其反革命内战消耗。此举之另一企图则为把四大家族控制下的“国营事业”化为四大家族“合法”私产，因为蒋区民间工商业家在四大家族压迫、损害或限制下，目前已不能维持生存，绝对拿不出偌大的美金来购买“国营事业”。
