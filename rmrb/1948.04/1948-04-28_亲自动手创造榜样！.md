Short commentary:

    Spring plowing and production is what the masses urgently demand at present. Except for a few villages carrying out Party rectification and democratic movements combined with production, most other areas should concentrate all their efforts on leading production. Recently, many counties and districts have held production mobilization meetings, resolved the ideological problems of village cadres, deployed spring plowing work, and some have conducted production inspections. The work of spring plowing and production has attracted the attention of leading comrades, but doing only this will not achieve much effect. For example, in Yangtoushan, Yangtun, and Beipingchang villages in the third and fourth districts of Wu'an, the chaotic phenomena are very serious, and spring plowing and production is very sluggish. Hou Guoying, Commissioner of the Sixth Prefecture of Taihang, has already published an article in the Taihang Xinhua Daily pointing out that counties and districts should overcome this kind of chaotic phenomenon and turn to spring plowing and production. However, according to today's news from the Fourth District of Wu'an, the chaotic situation is still very serious. Comrade Hou Guoying instructed the Wu'an County Government to resolutely correct serious phenomena such as infringing on the interests of middle peasants, which is very good. However, the facts from various places make us feel that resolutions and instructions alone are not enough. The most needed step at present is for the leaders of the prefecture and county to personally create a model of leading production in one or several villages, and promote it generally, which is the most effective method.

    The leadership work of this year's spring plowing and production is very complicated. Because our publicity of the Party rectification, democracy, and supplementary policies is not widespread or in-depth, many village cadres are passively lying down, bad elements are taking the opportunity to make trouble, and the interests of middle peasants are seriously infringed, causing serious chaotic phenomena in some villages. Among our county and district cadres, there are also many comrades who are willing to lead "land reform" but unwilling to lead production, pushing production work only to village cadres. And many district and village cadres, due to insufficient understanding of the Party rectification policy and lack of experience in the leadership methods of the mass line, are tied up in their work, causing the spring plowing and production work in most villages to fall into a state of laissez-faire. Therefore, we hope that the leaders of the prefecture and county, in addition to immediately dispatching a large number of capable cadres to quickly strengthen production leadership, will also personally go deep into one or several villages to create specific solutions to various problems (such as solving the ideological problems of cadres, correcting the infringement of the interests of middle peasants, settling landlords, organizing and rectifying mutual aid, etc.), resolve the process, gain experience, and promote others to open up the situation. If we do not do this, but only "send military orders downwards," we will not be able to lead the spring plowing and production work well.

### 亲自动手创造榜样！

    亲自动手创造榜样！
    春耕生产已是目前群众迫切要求，除少数村庄进行整党民主运动结合生产外，其余大部地区应集中全力领导生产。近来很多县区已召开生产动员大会，解决村干思想问题，布置春耕工作，有的进行了生产检查。春耕生产工作，已引起领导同志的注意，但只是这样做，其收效是不大的。如武安三、四区阳头山、阳屯、北凭昌等村，混乱现象非常严重，春耕生产非常消沉。太行六专署专员侯国英同志已在太行新华日报著论指出，让县区克服此种混乱现象，转向春耕生产。但据今天武安四区消息，混乱局面仍很严重。侯国英同志指示武安县府，对侵犯中农等严重现象予以坚决纠正，这是很好的。不过，从各地事实让我们感到，只有决议、指示等是不够的。目前最需要的一步棋，就是专、县领导同志，亲自动手，在一个村或几个村创造出领导生产的榜样来，推动一般，才是最有效的办法。
    今年春耕生产的领导工作是非常复杂的，由于我们宣传整党民主抽补的政策不普遍不深入，不少村干消极躺倒，坏分子乘机捣乱，严重侵犯中农利益，造成了某些村庄的严重混乱现象。在我们县区干部当中，也有不少同志愿意领导“土改”，不愿领导生产，把生产工作只推到村干部身上。而许多区村干部由于对整党政策了解不够，对于群众路线的领导方法，又缺乏经验，工作上束手束脚，致使大多数村庄春耕生产工作陷于自流。因此，我们希望专、县领导同志，除即抽调大批得力干部迅速加强生产领导外，并即亲自深入到一个村或几个村，创造出各种问题（如解决干部思想，纠正侵犯中农利益，安置地主，组织与整顿互助等问题）的具体解决办法，解决过程，取得经验，推动其他打开局面。如果不这样做，只是“一支军令往下传”，是不能把春耕生产工作领导好的。
