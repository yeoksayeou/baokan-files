　　Tinghepu Poor Peasants' League Committee
  　Self-Criticism and Overcoming Shortcomings
    [Li Cheng News] After the Tinghepu Poor Peasants' League was formally established on March 19, it conducted party rectification work for half a month. On April 3, the Poor Peasants' League held its second enlarged committee meeting (with group leaders participating) and conducted self-criticism. In the self-criticism, Wang Fengtai said: "During the party rectification, before the party members finished their reflections, we all interrupted and made them unsure of what to say, blocking their reflection. This is my shortcoming." Vice Chairman Yang Naiqin criticized himself, saying: "We were also not right to the party members in the past. We didn't greet them, making the general party members afraid of us." Chairman Wang Guangtian said: "I have a big mistake. Last time our poor peasant group held a meeting, Xiao Lao told me that everyone was not speaking up. I demanded an attitude and scolded everyone. Song Kui got angry with me. In the future, I will always change my attitude." Woman Yang Chuntang said: "I am not careful enough in my work. Last time the poor peasant group held a meeting, I notified a middle peasant, but then asked him to leave halfway. This is my shortcoming." After the committee members' self-criticism, the work team comrades criticized some of the previous work for being too much of a takeover, and pointed out that the Poor Peasants' League was too dependent on the work team, and some individual members were arrogant. For example, Huo Cheng said: "I said let's remove the party members together, we have many cadres in the Poor Peasants' League!" These all need everyone to pay attention to overcome in the future.

　　停河铺贫农团委员
  　自我检讨克服缺点
    【黎城消息】停河铺贫农团三月十九日正式成立后，半个月时间进行了整党工作，在四月三日贫农团召开第二次扩大委员会（小组长参加），做了自我检讨。在检讨中，王凤台说：“在整党中党员反省还没有说完，咱就齐插嘴，弄的党员不知怎样说才行，把他反省口堵住了，这是咱个缺点。”副主席杨乃琴检讨自己说：“咱们过去对党员也有不对，见了党员不和人家吭气，使一般党员害咱怕。”主席王广田说：“我可有个大大的不对，上次咱贫农小组开会，小牢给我说大家不吭气，我去要了一个态度，把大家说了一顿，松魁给我起了脾气，今后我总要改了我这种态度。”妇女杨春堂说：“我工作太不细心，上次贫农小组开会，我把中农通知上了，半路又叫人家走啦，这可是我个缺点。”委员检讨后，工作组同志检讨前一段工作中有些包办，并给大家指出贫农团有些依靠工作组，有个别团员自高，如火成说：我说把党员一同除掉，咱贫农团干家可多哩！这都需要今后大家注意克服。（停河铺工作组）
