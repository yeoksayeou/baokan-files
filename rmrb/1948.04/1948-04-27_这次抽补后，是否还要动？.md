    After This Requisition and Compensation, Will There Be Further Changes? Comrade Editor:
    Spring plowing is now in full swing. After publicizing the policy of "whoever cultivates the land owns the harvest," the masses' thinking has become relatively stable, and their enthusiasm for production is also relatively high. However, the issue has not been completely resolved, and the masses still have many concerns. From what I understand, the most important is the "cultivate for one season" mentality, waiting for next year instead of this year, and still waiting and watching. For example, after hearing the announcement of "whoever cultivates the land owns the harvest," some people say, "Don't worry, we are not afraid this year!" Some say, "Just plant something quickly, who cares if it only lasts a year! Who knows whose it will be next year..." Some middle peasants misunderstood the Central Committee's instruction that "it will take two to three years to carry out," and said, "It will take several years to do this, there will be no changes this year, but who knows if there will be changes next year." The masses will not produce well if they have these thoughts; some are superficially engaged in production, but in reality, they are sloppy and do not put in effort. How should this problem be solved, and how should we publicize it? Please advise. (Yu Jin)

Comrade Yu Jin:
    The ideological problem of the masses raised in your letter is indeed an important issue. In the past, because there were no standards for class demarcation, many middle peasants were wrongly struggled against, and they developed misconceptions and doubts about the Party's policies. Therefore, it is not enough to simply publicize the policy of "whoever cultivates the land owns the harvest." We must go a step further and explain clearly: the spirit of the policy is very resolute and clear, that in the requisition and compensation, the movable property of middle peasants and the land of well-to-do middle peasants will not be touched; even if a little is touched, the person's consent is required. Those who were wrongly struggled against in the past must be resolutely admitted to and compensated, and everything must be done in accordance with the policy. The two to three years mentioned by the Central Committee refers to the entire liberated area, meaning that this is a very meticulous task, and the leadership should take two to three years to earnestly carry it out, focusing on creating experience in a few places first, and gradually promoting it, without rushing for quick results, so as to avoid further problems. The strength of cadres in various places also varies, and when the strength is not enough, this place can be worked on this year, and that place can be worked on next year. Such meticulousness is beneficial to our masses. But no matter sooner or later, as long as a village has truly handled matters in accordance with the Land Law Outline, there will be no further changes. After the equal distribution of requisitioned and compensated land is completed, each household will also be issued a land certificate, which will be the final confirmation of land rights. In the past, there were struggles time and time again because the methods were not thorough and the elimination of feudalism was not thorough. This time, the Land Law will be thoroughly implemented, and there will be no further changes. Now, some people are afraid of changes and have a "cultivate for one season" mentality. You can tell them that our old liberated areas have small-scale requisition and compensation, and we should work hard; even if it is really just cultivating for one season, it is our own loss if we do not cultivate well and produce less grain.

### 这次抽补后，是否还要动？

    这次抽补后，是否还要动？编辑同志：
    现在春耕正紧张，经过宣传政策和谁种谁收，群众思想比较稳定，生产情绪也比较高些了，但还解决的不够彻底，群众还有不少疑虑，据我了解，最重要的是“种一季”思想，不等今年等明年，还是等待观望。如听了谁种谁收的布告，即有人说：“不怕，今年是不怕！”有的说：“扑拉扑拉土种上就算，怕不长一年哩！明年还不知是谁的哩。……”有的中农误解了中央指示中说：“要以二年至三年的时间来进行”，就说：“一直要搞几年哩，今年不动，明年谁知动不动。”群众有这些思想还是不好好生产；有些表面上也在生产了，实际是马马虎虎不下功夫，这问题究如何解决，如何宣传？希指示。（余今）余今同志：
    来信提出群众思想问题，确是一个重要问题。过去因为划阶级无标准，错斗了许多中农，他们对党的政策发生了错觉和怀疑，因此，只笼统宣传政策和谁种谁收是不够的。必须更深入一步讲明：政策精神是非常坚决明确的，抽补中不动中农浮财，富裕中农土地，即动一点也要本人同意。过去错斗的要坚决认错赔偿，一切按政策办事。中央提的二年至三年，是指全解放区说的，意思是说这是个很细致的工作，领导上要用两三年时间认真来作，要有重点的先在几个地方创造经验，逐步推广，不急于求成，免得再出毛病。各地干部多少强弱也不同，力量顾不过来时，可以今年作这个地方，明年再作那个地方。这样细致，对我们群众是有好处的。但不管迟早，一个村只要真按土地法大纲办了事，就再也不动了。平分抽补完毕，各家还要发一个土地证，就算最后确定了地权。过去斗了一次又一次，是因为办法不彻底，封建消灭也不彻底，这次彻底实现了土地法，就再不动了。现在有些群众因为怕动，存在“种一季”思想，可以告诉他，咱们老区是小范围抽补，应该好好作务；即便真是今年种一季，不好好种，少打粮食也是自己吃亏。
