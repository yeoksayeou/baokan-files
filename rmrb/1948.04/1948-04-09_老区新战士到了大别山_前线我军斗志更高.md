Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, 7th: New warriors from the old liberated areas have arrived in the Dabie Mountains, bringing with them vigorous vitality as soon as they join the troops. Whenever there are meetings or classes, the new warriors take the lead in singing, and they always rush to do public service and chores. They also write slogans and draw propaganda posters everywhere. In a certain regiment, new warriors stayed by the machine guns the day they arrived in the company, asking the veteran soldiers to teach them how to use the machine guns, and requested their superiors to issue them guns immediately. One day, during a troop exercise to build a bridge, the pontoon bridge was about to overturn, but a new warrior rushed up, resulting in him falling into the water. He said, "The exercise should be treated as if it were real. Our group has already passed the front, how can we not pass the back?" The new warriors, seeing that the veteran soldiers lived a hard and simple life, automatically took out their clothes, shoes, and socks for the veteran soldiers to wear, and said, "You have suffered, but you are truly glorious." The new warriors of a certain regiment also took out more than 20,000 yuan in Jichaio currency and distributed it to the veteran soldiers to buy yellow tobacco to smoke. After the veteran soldiers repeatedly and politely refused, they bought paper and pens and distributed them to everyone to learn to write. A certain regiment used sorghum to exchange for some white flour from the common people to welcome the new warriors. The new warriors believed that this was harming the interests of the masses. When a certain unit mistakenly burned the firewood of the poor, the new warriors immediately reported to the leadership, requesting correction for violating mass discipline. In these many exemplary actions, the troops at the front generally reflected that "the new warriors have a clear stand, high political awareness, are active in learning, and have democratic living habits, which greatly strengthens the morale of the troops." Yu Yuqin, a soldier in a certain regiment, said: "I was originally in a bad mood. After the newly emancipated comrades introduced many situations in our rear area, I was determined to continue fighting and resolutely overthrow Chiang Kai-shek." Many veteran squad leaders said: "The new warriors are not simple, we must humbly learn from them."

　　老区新战士到了大别山
  　前线我军斗志更高
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线七日电】从老解放区来到大别山的新战士，一到部队，就带来了蓬勃的朝气，每逢开会或上课前，新战士带头唱歌，公差勤务总是抢着干，又到处写标语画宣传画。某团新战士，头天到连队就守在机枪跟前要老战士教他们学习使机枪，并请求上级马上给他们发枪。某天部队演习架桥，浮桥眼看要翻了，但一个新战士跟着冲上去，结果掉到水里。他说：“演习就要当真的作，俺们一个小组，前面已经过去了，后面不过去还行？”新战士看到老战士生活艰苦朴素，自动拿出衣服鞋袜给老战士穿，并且说：“你们受了苦啦，但是你们可真光荣。”某团新战士还拿出两万多元冀钞，分给老战士买黄烟吸，经老战士再三婉言拒绝，又买成纸笔分给大家学习写字。某团为欢迎新战士，用高粱向老百姓换了些白面，新战士认为这是损害了群众利益。某部误烧了穷人的柴，新战士立即向领导上提出：纠正违犯群众纪律。新战士在这许多的模范行动中，使前方的部队普遍反映说：“新战士立场明确，政治认识高，学习积极，富有民主的生活习惯，大大加强了部队的斗志。”某团战士余鱼琴说：“我本来有些情绪不好，经翻身新同志介绍了许多咱后方情形，我就下决心干下去，坚决打倒蒋介石。”许多老班长说：“新战士可不简单，可得虚心向他们学习”。
