　　[News from this newspaper] The Pingding County Party Committee convened a meeting of all central groups on March 28th to study the combination of democratic rectification and spring plowing production to overcome the famine. At the meeting, each district reported on the spring famine situation below: Due to the looting by the pseudo-Yan regime and the poor harvest last autumn, most of the masses are currently in a situation of barely having enough to eat, coupled with the prevalence of epidemics, resulting in a severe famine. The masses urgently hope that the leadership can find ways to production and overcome all difficulties to get through the famine. However, after the Land Law Outline was issued, misunderstandings arose due to insufficient publicity, and village cadres abandoned leadership and did nothing, and production was left to its own devices. Although the county leadership had long paid attention to this issue, the first instruction (early March) was issued to the work groups in each district: "Land reform should not delay spring plowing and planting, and should be subordinate to production and disaster relief." The second instruction (five or six days later) was issued to the work groups in each district: Democratic rectification pilot villages in famine areas can stop rectification and turn to production. The district leadership did not pay enough attention, believing that democratic rectification was important and abandoning leadership of non-pilot villages. According to the demands of the masses, not having enough to eat is a major problem. Therefore, some villages that were undergoing democratic rectification were temporarily stopped, and all efforts were made to lead the masses in spring plowing production to overcome the famine. The number of democratic rectification villages has been reduced from nineteen to ten. After the cessation, each village retains one or two cadres, with the poor peasant league as the backbone, to lead the masses in production and disaster relief. In production and disaster relief, education is strengthened to raise the awareness of the masses, laying the foundation for future rectification. Villages that have not stopped democratic rectification should combine it with spring plowing and production disaster relief. Detailed discussions were also held based on the conditions of each district and different production conditions, and the future direction was determined and the following specific problems were solved:

　　1. The focus of the entire county's work is on production and disaster relief. In order to overcome the spring famine and complete this political task, the county is under the unified leadership of the County Party Committee in terms of organizational leadership. The leveling groups in the districts are changed to production and disaster relief groups. In the villages, rely on poor peasants, good cadres, and absorb middle peasants to jointly organize a production and disaster relief committee to lead and solve various difficulties of the masses (loans, food loans, disaster relief, etc.), becoming the leading body for village-level production and disaster relief work. 2. The disaster situation in the county is serious, and the masses are ideologically pessimistic and waiting. Therefore, solving the ideological problems of the masses and raising morale is the main link in overcoming the spring famine. Mobilize the masses to find ways to production, and the leadership provides loans and food loans to organize the masses to produce (with poor peasants as the backbone, uniting all middle peasants). In terms of production avenues in each district, the first and sixth districts are mostly industrial villages, focusing on improving workers' skills and finding a large number of sales channels. The second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh districts organize semi-labor to carry out spring plowing production, extracting full labor for transportation. The Chengguan district sells grain in small stalls, boils saltpeter, and burns charcoal. The eighth and ninth districts (old districts) engage in textiles, etc., ensuring that everyone is not idle. Regarding the production of landlords, after discussion by the masses, their control and compulsory production are generally to be abolished. Middle peasants who have been wrongly struggled are to be compensated, and some of the undistributed land is to be assigned to them for production. 3. In the matter of loans, it is necessary to meet the requirements of both poor peasants and also to take care of the middle peasants (because the middle peasants also have difficulties in the disaster), overcoming the exclusion of middle peasants in the past in loans, so as not to affect the mood of production. 4. Leveling villages must be subordinate to production and disaster relief, paying special attention to the combination in terms of time, and must not delay the production time of the masses.

  　全力领导生产救灾
  　补偿错斗中农损失解决生产困难
    【本报消息】平定县委于三月二十八日召开各中心小组会议，研究民主填补与春耕生产渡荒的结合。会上各区汇报了下面春荒情况：由于阎伪抢掠及去秋歉收，目前大部群众处在吃了上顿没下顿的情况下，兼之瘟疫流行，造成严重灾荒。群众迫切的希望领导上能给找下生产门路，排除万难，渡过灾荒。但土地法大纲下来后，宣传不够发生误解，村干部放弃领导躺倒不干，生产处于自流，县的领导上虽早就注意了这问题，第一次（三月初）给各区工作组发出指示：“土改要不误春耕下种，服从生产救灾”。第二次（隔了五、六天）又给各区工作组发了个指示：民主填补实验村庄处于灾荒区者可停止填补转向生产。区的领导上注意不够，认为民主填补重要，放弃非实验村的领导。根据群众要求，没吃的是个大问题，因此把一部分正进行民主填补的村庄暂时停止进行，全力领导群众进行春耕生产渡荒，已从十九个民主填补村缩小到十个。停止后的村每村还留一、二个干部，以贫农团为骨干，领导群众生产渡荒。在生产渡荒中，加强教育，提高群众觉悟，打下将来填补基础，未停止民主填补的村庄，要与春耕和生产救灾相结合。并根据各区情况与不同生产条件作了详细讨论，确定了今后方针与解决了以下几个具体问题：
    一、全县工作中心以生产救灾为主，为战胜春荒，完成这一政治任务，在组织领导上，县里由县委会统一领导，区的平分小组改为生产救灾小组，村里依靠贫雇、好干部、吸收中农共同组织生产救灾委员会，领导与解决群众各种困难（贷款贷粮救灾等），成为村级生产救灾工作的领导机关。二、全县的灾情严重，群众思想上是悲观等待，因此解决群众思想问题，提高斗志，是战胜春荒的主要环节。发动群众找生产出路，领导上进行贷款贷粮组织群众生产（以贫雇为骨干，团结全体中农）。在各区生产门路上，一、六区大部是工业村，以提高工人技术，大量找销路。二、三、四、五、七区组织半劳力进行春耕生产，抽出全劳力搞运输，城关区贩粮摆小摊，熬硝烧炭，八、九区（老区）纺织等，做到人人不闲。对地主生产问题，经过群众讨论，一般要取消对他们的管制和义务生产，对错斗中农进行补偿，把未分配之土地给指定一部，使其生产。三、贷款问题上要做到既满足贫雇要求，也要照顾中农（因灾荒中农也有困难），克服过去在贷款中排斥中农，以免影响生产情绪。四、平分村庄必须服从于生产救灾，特别注意时间上的结合，决不能耽误群众生产时间。（平定联合办公室、马效云、杨庭栋、李战夫）
