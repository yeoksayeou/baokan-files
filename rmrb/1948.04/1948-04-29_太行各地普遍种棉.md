Taihang News: A cotton planting campaign has begun in most areas of Taihang. Due to insufficient spring rain last year, very little cotton was planted in this region. Only some areas carried water to plant a small amount. This year, the rain has been timely and even since the beginning of spring, and the masses are very enthusiastic about planting cotton. After the Fourth District of Wu'an participated in the county's production mobilization meeting on the 4th of this month, they originally planned to hold a district and village cadre meeting. However, a thorough rain fell on the 8th, so they decided to postpone the meeting, and the district cadres immediately dispersed to various villages to organize a crash planting of cotton. In one week, they planted more than 48,470 mu (this area is a cotton-producing region). After the rain in Neiqiu and Zanhuang, the county government immediately instructed all villages to rush to plant cotton. Zanhuang also issued a cotton planting bulletin to promote the work. All villages rushed to plant, and many villages have exceeded the county's call for each person to plant three fen of cotton. After calculating the accounts, Xiyangzhai in Neiqiu found that one mu of cotton is equivalent to three mu of grain, and they planted 77 mu in three days. In Hubu Village, Xingtai, women suspended their spinning and weaving to cooperate with men in rushing to plant cotton. Ping順, Licheng, Zuquan and Shexian, which previously planted less cotton, are also promoting it on a large scale after successful trials in the past one or two years. In Yin Guo, Ping順, after the ground thawed, the masses rushed to repair the cotton fields and prepare seeds, and immediately rushed to plant after the rain at the end of March. The Third District planted 2,600 mu in nine days, and the fifteen villages in the Fourth District planted more than 2,300 mu. Lucunying Village in Cixian allocated 30 mu of fruit land stored by the farmers' association to 14 households with insufficient land to grow cotton. The Gengle Cooperative in Shexian bought back more than 1,000 jin of cotton seeds and sold them to the masses at the original price. Due to the timely spring rain, it is expected that this year's cotton planting will greatly exceed last year's.

    太行各地普遍种棉
    【太行消息】太行大部地区已开始掀起植棉运动。本区去年春雨缺少，棉花种的很少，只有部分地区担水点种了一些，今年入春以来雨水调匀，群众植棉劲头很大。武安四区于本月四日参加了县的生产动员会后，本计划还要开区村干部会，恰于八日下了透雨，便决定暂停开会，区干部也立即分散到各村组织突击种花，一周间种了四万八千四百七十余亩（该地是产棉区）。内邱、赞皇落雨后，县府即紧急指示各村突击下种，赞皇并出了种棉快报推动。各村均纷纷抢种，不少村庄已超过了县里号召每人种花三分的计划。内邱西阳寨经算帐后，一亩花能顶三亩田，三天种了七十七亩。邢台户部村在种花时，妇女暂停纺织协同男人突击种花。以前种花较少的平顺、黎城、左权、涉县，经过近一二年试验成功后，也在大量推广。平顺尹郭群众地冻溶解后即纷纷修整棉田，准备种籽，三月底落雨后随即突击下种。三区九天种了两千六百亩，四区十五个村种了二千三百余亩。磁县路村营将农会存的三十亩果实地，分配给十四户缺地少地户种花。涉县更乐合作社，买回花籽一千余斤，原价卖给群众。由于春雨下的适时，预计今年种花将大大超过去年。
