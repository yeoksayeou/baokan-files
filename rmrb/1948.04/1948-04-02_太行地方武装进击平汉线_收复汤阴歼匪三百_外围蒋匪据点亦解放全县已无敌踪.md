(Reported by this newspaper from Taihang on the 31st) The Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district's local armed forces have recovered Tangyin County. On the evening of the 24th, our Fifth Military Sub-district's 52nd Regiment, the Tangyin Independent Battalion, and a portion of the militia, using fierce firepower to clear out the Chiang bandit outer strongholds of Sunzhuang and Dongzhuang west of the city, launched an attack on Tangyin city. At midnight, they stormed into the city. The defending enemy, Chiang bandit security regiments, "Homecoming Legions," and "Associations," fearing annihilation by our forces, abandoned the city and fled towards Anyang city. We immediately occupied the city. On the 25th, our troops, taking advantage of the victory, coordinated with the Southern Hebei troops to pursue and mop up the strongholds of Chenhuang Village, Yangzhuang, Dazhanggai, and Sikong Village east and north of the city. After a portion of the defending enemy was annihilated, they also fled to Anyang in disarray. By this point, the entire territory of Tangyin had been liberated. In this battle, over seventy enemies were killed or wounded, and two hundred and eighty-nine local Chiang soldiers, including the deputy captain of the puppet Tangyin security force, Ji Wentian, were captured alive. Two light machine guns, seventy-two rifles and carbines, one small cannon, thirty-one short guns, one thousand five hundred and thirty-nine rounds of ammunition, nine bicycles, nine head of livestock, two thousand five hundred jin of grain, and a portion of other military supplies were seized. Tangyin city was occupied by Chiang bandits on November 8th of last year.

Another dispatch: After the liberation of Tangyin city, the democratic government immediately cooperated with the army to form a Military-Political Work Committee to comfort and relieve the masses who had been ravaged by the Chiang bandits, restore order, and mobilize the masses to cooperate in searching for remnant bandits scattered and hidden in the city.

(Reported by this newspaper from Taihang) On the morning of the 22nd of this month, over four hundred enemies stationed in Kuai Village, Xinxiang, came to our Qianhou Fancheng and Muzhuang areas to loot grain and conscript soldiers. Our Huixian battalion, in order to strike at the invading enemy, immediately engaged the enemy with two companies of troops, repelling the enemy, killing or wounding over thirty enemies, capturing four enemies, and seizing eight rifles. Furthermore, a portion of the Huixian battalion, on the night of the 20th, with lightning speed, launched a surprise attack on the Xujiaqiao stronghold four li east of Anyang city. With swift action, we crushed the enemy's village police team, captured six enemies, and seized one machine gun and thirteen rifles. In the above three battles, we only suffered four minor injuries.
