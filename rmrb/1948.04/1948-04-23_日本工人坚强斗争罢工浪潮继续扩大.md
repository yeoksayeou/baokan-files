Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 21st: Tokyo dispatch: The US occupation authorities, alarmed by the expanding Japanese labor unrest, issued an order on the 8th from the headquarters of the US First Army strictly prohibiting worker demonstrations, marches, and mass rallies, threatening that "violators will be tried by military tribunals." On the 15th, MacArthur further instructed Gillen, chief of the Labor Section of the US military headquarters, to reiterate the reactionary decree that "all strike disputes, whether regional or local, must be terminated immediately," and explicitly forbade the strike of 20,000 Osaka transport workers. However, the Japanese working class has not been intimidated by these threats and continues to wage a tenacious battle. According to the "Tokyo Shimbun" on the 16th, the "All Japan Metal Miners' Union," with 75,000 members, declared that if the workers' demands for wage increases are rejected, the union workers will strike around the 20th. The transport workers' union is determined to continue its struggle.

　　日本工人坚强斗争罢工浪潮继续扩大
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】东京讯：美占领军当局为继续扩大的日本工潮所震慑，八日美第一军司令部曾下令严禁工人示威游行及举行群众大会，并威胁称：“违令者将受军事法庭审判”，十五日麦克阿瑟更嘱令美军总部劳工科长吉伦重申“一切罢工纠纷，不论其为地域性或一地者，立即终止”的反动法令，同时明令禁止大阪两万日本交通工人罢工。但日本工人阶级并未被这些要胁恫吓所吓倒，仍坚持顽强的战斗。据“东京新闻”十六日消息，拥有七万五千名会员的“全日金属矿工工会”声言，如工人增资要求被拒绝，该工会工人将于二十日前后罢工。交通工人工会仍决继续斗争。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】东京讯：日共党员中原顺一于十五日被选为“全日电气装备工人工会”（拥有十万会员）主席。日共党员渡边三夫则连选连任为该工会总书记。
