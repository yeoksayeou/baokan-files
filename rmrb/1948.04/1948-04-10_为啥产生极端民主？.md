　　Why Does Extreme Democracy Arise?
    Recently, we have received many letters from readers raising many questions about all aspects of land reform, which we think is very good. Some questions have been asked by several readers at the same time, which shows that they represent the thoughts and understandings of some cadres, party members, and the masses. Now we plan to answer those more general questions with a certain amount of space, and we hope that everyone will continue to raise questions, but they must be written specifically and clearly. The answers here are not necessarily completely correct, and everyone can still raise questions for discussion and research.
    Editor Comrades: Your newspaper published news on April 3 regarding the problem of extreme democracy in Qingyan Temple. Similarly, it also exists in Tian'erzhuang and is being corrected. From our point of view, what is the essence of extreme democracy? It is "sharp heads in charge," it is fake democracy, not democracy. What are sharp heads? Their characteristics are extreme selfishness, 90 percent have "hooligan habits," and they often hold prejudices against the masses and cadres, seeking revenge. Since this party rectification democratic movement, due to the leadership's mistakes of tailism, the sharp heads have taken the opportunity to become active. Although they were not elected as cadres due to the high awareness of the old liberated area masses, the new cadres are all honest and upright people, and they have no way to deal with the sharp heads. They don't understand what true democracy is and are afraid of being accused of being undemocratic if they don't listen to them, a burden they can't bear. As a result, many cadre issues are compromised and conceded to by the sharp heads, forming "sharp heads in charge." Here is an example: Selfish and lazy veteran Lao Peng (Yang Ti, nicknamed for making unreasonable suggestions); the bottomless pit Da Pao San Jie Bian (Yang Delin, who likes to plan for himself and argue with others); the loafing Cao Shuanzi, who used to sell noodles; Er Xiezi (Yang Quan, nicknamed for being cross-eyed), who framed people as spies out of personal revenge. When discussing filling in land and windfall wealth, they expressed many incorrect opinions. The Farmers' Association Committee was afraid of being "undemocratic" and offending these "masses," so they "elected" them as appraisers at the meeting. The new cadres called this "polishing the sharp heads," thinking that they must "torment" them so that they can learn. This theory is supported by all the new cadres, but it is actually incorrect. For example, at the meeting, they wanted to take the donkey of middle peasant Yang Chunfa and give it to the Farmers' Association, saying that he was shielded during the last struggle. They wanted to take out the residence of the political director Yang Yunfeng, saying that it was "probably" bought cheaply, but it was actually bought with his own money through the masses. Many of them have turned over too much, saying during the evaluation, "I am a pile of dirt, I can't be filled up anyway." Perhaps in order to be able to fill themselves up, they desperately and unreasonably asked party members to "return" this and "return" that, like they were landlords. The meeting was just a quarrel, "not taking the right path." Farmers' Association Committee member Yang Suishan said: "They don't pave the road, others think of a way, and they just tear it down, nothing can be discussed." This delayed the work for two or three days. The masses were disgusted, "The gardens haven't been planted yet, what if it continues like this?" The work team suggested that the Farmers' Association Committee stop the work of the appraisers, and everything should be discussed by the Farmers' Association Committee and then passed by the general assembly, before this work turned around. Based on the above situation, we believe that extreme democracy is essentially "sharp heads in charge," which is undemocratic. The new cadres lack experience and knowledge, and the old party member cadres have just made self-criticisms. They said: "We are willing to work, and we dare to express opinions to honest farmers, but we dare not say anything to that group of people (the sharp heads)!" The sharp heads took advantage of this loophole to manipulate the masses and disrupt order in order to achieve their selfish goals. We must resolutely educate them at this time, expose them, and ask them to abide by order, obey the opinions of the majority, and implement the resolutions of the Farmers' Association; educate the masses not to be lenient to the sharp heads, educate party members and new cadres to firmly stand on the side of the majority of the masses, support the opinions of the masses, not be afraid of offending the sharp heads, and transform them. The extreme democracy in Qingyan Temple seems to be a problem of a few "sharp heads," not the real demands and emotions of the entire masses. We don't know the situation, so we hope you will study it. (Tian'erzhuang Work Team)
    Editor's Note: The experiences of Qingyan Temple and Tian'erzhuang prove that the emergence of extreme democratic deviations is due to the masses' misunderstanding of democracy, their fear of criticizing and exposing the activities of a few selfish and self-interested elements, and even some blind agreement; but what is particularly noteworthy is that the work team itself has unclear ideas, commits tailism, and abandons leadership. Therefore, the work team should be very vigilant, and for all deviations, they must always grasp the principles, persuade and educate the masses, and encourage the masses to give the necessary blows to a few selfish and self-interested speculators. Only in this way can the work be completed smoothly.

### 为啥产生极端民主？

专栏：研究与讨论　

　　为啥产生极端民主？
    近来我们接到不少读者来信，对于土地改革各方面提出了许多的问题，我们认为很好。有些问题，同时有好几个读者写信来问，可见代表了一部分干部、党员、群众的思想和认识。现在我们打算以一定的篇幅来答复那些带有较普遍性的问题，希望大家有问题继续提出来，但一定要写得具体、明确。这里的答复不见得尽对，大家如有意见，也还可以再提出来讨论和研究。
    编辑同志：贵报四月三日发表青烟寺极端民主问题的消息，同样地，在田二庄也存在着，并正在纠正中。从我们这里看，极端民主的实质是什么呢？是“尖头当家”，是假民主，不民主。啥是尖头呢？他们的特点是极端的自私自利者，百分之九十是有“流氓习气”的人，对群众对干部常抱成见，闹报复。这次整党民主运动以来，由于领导上存在着尾巴主义的错误，尖头们乘机活跃起来，虽然由于老区群众觉悟高，他们没有被选为干部，但是新干部都是老实正派的人，对于尖头没有办法，不了解什么是真民主，恐怕不听他们的话落个不民主的罪名，担不起来。结果好些问题干部对尖头让步妥协，形成“尖头当家”。这里不妨举个例子：自私自利，劳动不强的退伍军人老碰（杨梯，因好提无理的意见得名）；没底窟窿的大炮三节鞭（杨德林，好为自己打算与人争吵）；不务正业，卖过料面的曹拴子；为私仇按贼害人（给人加特务帽子）的二斜子（杨全，因眼斜得名）。在讨论填补土地与浮财时，他们发表许多不正确意见，农会委员会怕“不民主”，得罪了他们这些“群众”，在大会上“选”他们这些人为评议员，新干部把这叫做“磨尖头”，认为非这样叫他们“熬熬眼”受受罪不照，这种理论是全体新干部所拥护的，其实是不正确的。如开会时，他们要把中农杨春发的驴牵给农会，说他上次斗争时被包庇下来。要把政治主任杨云峰的住宅拿出来，说“大概”是贱买的，其实是用自己的钱经过群众买的。他们好多人是翻身过高了，评议时说“我是圪堆，反正填不上我了”。也许是为了能填上自己，所以拼命的无理的要党员“退”这“退”那，象对老财一样。开会就是吵吵，“不走正路”，农会委员杨随山说：“他们不铺路，别人想个道路他光拆，啥事也讨论不成。”就这样把工作推迟了两三天，群众厌烦了，“园还没种上，象这样还照”？工作组建议农会委员会，停止评议员的工作，一切由农委会讨论，再交大会通过，才在这件工作上转了过来。根据以上情况，我们认为极端民主，实质是“尖头当家”，是不民主。新干部经验差，知识少，党员旧干部刚刚作了反省，他们说：“工作俺们愿干，对老实农民我们也敢提意见，就是对那伙子人（尖头）我们不敢哼”！尖头们就钻了这个空子，操纵群众，破坏秩序，以达到他们自私自利的目的。我们要在此时坚决的教育他们，揭露他们，要他们遵守秩序，服从大多数人的意见，执行农会的决议；教育群众对尖头不要留情面，教育党员与新干部坚定的站在大多数群众方面，支持群众的意见，不怕惹尖头，要改造他们。青烟寺极端民主好象也是几个“尖头”的问题似的，不是全体群众的真正要求与情绪，未知如何，希加研究。（田二庄工作组）
    编者按：青烟寺与田二庄的经验证明，极端民主偏向的产生，是由于群众误解民主，对少数自私自利分子的活动，不敢批评揭露，甚至有些盲目附和；但特别值得注意的，是工作组自己思想不明确，犯了尾巴主义，放弃领导。因此，工作组应十分警惕，对一切偏向，都要随时掌握原则，说服教育群众，并鼓励群众给少数自私自利的投机分子予以必要的打击。只有这样，工作才能顺利完成。
