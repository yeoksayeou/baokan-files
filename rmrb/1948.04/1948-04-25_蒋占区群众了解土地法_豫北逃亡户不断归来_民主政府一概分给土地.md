　　Masses in Chiang-Occupied Areas Understand the Land Law
　　Fugitive Households from Northern Henan Continuously Return
　　Democratic Government Allocates Land to All
　　[Report from this newspaper, Taihang, 24th] In the border areas of northern Henan such as Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Jiaozuo, Qi County, Hui County, and Ji County, influenced by our political offensives, widespread publicity of the Outline Land Law, and news of the People's Liberation Army's victories, masses coerced and deceived by Chiang's bandits into fleeing to Chiang-occupied areas have, according to incomplete statistics, seen 1,565 people return to settle and produce in the liberated areas during the three months from January to March. In Xiuwu, the method of combining propaganda with armed attacks was adopted. Many small armed propaganda teams were organized to go deep into Chiang-occupied areas or border areas, compressing the enemy into several strongholds, preventing them from freely moving about. Methods such as street lectures, small forums, individual visits, and distribution of leaflets were used, citing examples of Chiang's bandits' atrocities such as conscription and grain robbery to expose the enemy's conspiracies. Combined with publicizing the Land Law, this aroused the masses' hatred for Chiang's puppet regime and mobilized their families to launch a "mutual calling movement." After their return, the democratic government promptly provided them with appropriate resettlement, allocating them their due share of land and property. As a result, the effect was significant, with more than 500 people returning within sixteen days. The fleeing masses in the Second District of Jiaozuo were initially skeptical and dared not return due to the enemy's rumors and deceptions. After our in-depth publicity, several meetings of the families of those who had fled were held, and those who had been resettled were organized to spread the word, and the number of returnees gradually increased. From March 11th to 30th, in twenty days, more than 100 people returned to the entire district. For example, Ma Shidao's wife and children from Mazhuang Village returned and saw that not only was there nothing wrong, but the village had also allocated her land to grow two mu of cotton. She then ran to call her husband, saying, "Don't be afraid, the liberated area treats us well!" The next day, Ma Shidao returned with all his furniture. Jiao Liuniu's family from Xin'an Town returned six people, and the Farmers' Association allocated him seventeen mu of wheat seedling land, and returned to him the more than two shi of grain he had left behind intact. He said with emotion: "In the south (Chiang-occupied area), let alone land distribution, I couldn't even live in a cave, and one dou of grain cost six or seven hundred thousand yuan, how could anyone survive? I heard that land was going to be distributed equally here, and I was afraid of missing out, so I hurried back." In the Sixth District of Qi County, all returning landlords and rich peasants were allocated a share of land, and returning middle peasants and poor peasants had the land and property temporarily preserved by the village governments returned to their original owners for cultivation. Households with no land or little housing were provided with land and necessary means of production to help them settle down and produce. For example, after Qi Xiaoqun, a fugitive household from Xia Pang Village, returned, the village government allocated twenty-one mu of land for him to cultivate. He said, "The two sides (referring to the liberated area and the Chiang-occupied area) are truly two different worlds. When I went out, I couldn't even support my wife and children, and even the donkey I took was sold for food. When I returned, the Farmers' Association found land for me to cultivate, and even promised to give me a loan if I didn't have livestock. This is really great." Fanglan Village in the Second District of Ji County also recently discussed the resettlement of returning fugitive households for production. Everyone's opinion was: the property of middle and poor peasants should be returned to its original owners; landlords and rich peasants should also be allocated enough land and means of production to maintain their livelihood. The eight households and twenty-six people who had returned to the village have all been settled and are engaged in spring plowing and production.

　　蒋占区群众了解土地法
    豫北逃亡户不断归来
  　民主政府一概分给土地
    【本报太行二十四日电】豫北修武、武陟、焦作、淇县、辉县、汲县等边沿地区，在我政治攻势，普遍宣传土地法大纲及解放军的胜利消息影响下，被蒋匪胁迫欺骗逃往蒋区的群众，据不完全统计，从一月到三月三个月中，已有一千五百六十五人，回到解放区内安家生产。修武在宣传上，采取宣传与武装出击结合的办法，组织了许多小型武装宣传队，深入到蒋占区或边沿区，把敌人压缩到几个据点内，使他不敢随便外出活动。运用街头讲演，开小型座谈会，个别访问，散发传单等方式，以蒋匪抓丁、抢粮等暴行实例，揭发敌人的阴谋。结合宣传土地法，激起群众对蒋伪的仇恨，并发动其家属展开“互叫运动”。回来后，民主政府即予以适当的安置，分给其应得的一份土地及财产。因而收效很大，十六天内即回来五百多人。焦作二区逃走的群众，开始由于敌人的造谣欺骗，都是半信半疑的不敢回来。后经我们深入宣传，召开了几次逃亡家属会，并组织已被安置的群众进行传播，回来的人便陆续增多。从三月十一日到三十日，二十天当中，全区就有一百多人回来。如马庄村马世道的老婆和孩子回来，见不但没事，村里还分给她地，种了二亩花。她随后便跑着去叫她的男人说：“可不怕，解放区待咱可好哩。”第二天，马世道便带着一切家具回来了。新安镇焦六妞家回来六个人，农会分给他十七亩麦苗地，并把他去时留下的二石多粮食原封未动的交给他，他感动的说：“我在南面（蒋区），不说分地的话，连窑也不能下，一斗粮食就得六七十万块钱，谁还能活。听说咱这里要平分土地，我怕误过就赶紧回来了。”淇县六区，凡回来的地主、富农都分给一份土地，回来的中农、贫农，各村政府即将暂为保存的土地、财产归还原主耕种，无地少房户调剂上土地与必要的生产资料，帮助安置进行生产。如下庞村逃户齐小群回来，村政府即调剂了二十一亩土地让他耕种，他说：“两头（指解放区与蒋区）真是两个世界，我出去引的老婆孩子，各顾各怎也活不了，赶的一头毛驴也卖了吃光，回来农会就给我找地种，没牲口还答应给我贷款，这真是太好了。”汲县二区芳兰村亦于最近讨论安置归来逃户的生产问题，大家意见：中农贫农物归原主；地主、富农也要调剂给他足以维持生活的土地与生产资料。该村回来的八户二十六口人，已都安置好进行春耕生产。
