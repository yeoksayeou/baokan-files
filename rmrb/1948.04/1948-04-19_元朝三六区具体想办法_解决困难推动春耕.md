　　Yuan Dynasty Third and Sixth Districts Find Concrete Ways
　　Solve Difficulties and Promote Spring Plowing
　　[Yuan Dynasty News] Cadres in the Third District examined the current difficulties in mass production, such as lack of land, lack of food, and inability to cultivate the land. Based on the actual situation, the District Committee studied solutions: (1) For poor peasants and hired laborers who have no land to cultivate, especially in poor villages and small hamlets, the land problem has not been well resolved in recent years. This time, the leftovers of land distribution, land occupied by schools and institutions, land cultivated by village-level departments, and clan land (the distribution of clan land should be carried out through mobilization, and taken out on a voluntary basis, otherwise it will cause dissatisfaction among the entire clan) were cleared up, totaling 278 mu, and 7 mu of village grounds, which have been distributed to farmers lacking land. For example, 21 mu of land belonging to district institutions and schools have been completely distributed to Xiaoliuzhuang, which has no struggle content. The clan land in Miaotou Village was previously in the hands of middle peasants, and after mobilization, they voluntarily transferred it to poor peasants and hired laborers who had no land to cultivate. This has enabled some poor peasants and hired laborers who had no land to cultivate to have land to cultivate. (2) Solutions to the food problem for poor peasants and hired laborers: actively mobilize and call for strengthening sideline activities, organizing wall building, oil pressing, opening lumber yards, and peddling, with district and village cadres personally helping. The source of capital comes from fundraising, distribution of leftover fruit, loans, etc. For example, in Shaodianzi, most people weave dung baskets, and some can weave twelve a day, earning 1,200 yuan. In Huazhuang, Ma Dong'e makes enough to eat from selling tofu residue alone. In Beiliudian, Wang Defeng earns a large dou of corn by carrying vegetables twice. (3) Solutions to the problem of cultivated land: 1. Use grass to exchange for animal power. Poor peasants and hired laborers give grass to households with livestock in exchange for animal power. Livestock-raising households also feel the difficulty because they have no grass. After exchanging for grass, they can keep the livestock and not sell it. 2. Mobilize poor peasants to actively find those with livestock, and middle and poor peasants to carry out mutual aid and equivalent exchange of labor. 3. Village cadres should play an exemplary role and proactively provide mutual aid and exchange of labor to poor peasants and hired laborers. The village cadre of Beizhuangdian helps Zhang Ergai cultivate the land, and Zhang Ergai's family does needlework for him, and when there is cotton, he picks cotton for him. Mobilize the masses to buy cattle together. Based on the above methods, the difficulties of poor peasants and hired laborers have been initially resolved. (Rongguang, Wenhua, Xinlin, Baoquan, Xueshu)
　　[Another news] In the 58 villages of the Sixth District of the Yuan Dynasty, there are about 275 households, with 915 people, who have no food to eat. The sowing season is now upon us, and solving this problem is the urgent demand of poor peasants and hired laborers. The leadership has mobilized all cadres to find ways to solve it. For example, Yangjia Village solved the current difficulties of 17 poor peasant and hired laborer households from the clearing of leftover fruit and tree funds. The poor peasants and hired laborers who have no food to eat in Yulin Village have solved the difficulties of eating and cultivating land through private free lending relationships by opening up their thinking on the class friendship of middle and poor peasants. For example, Liu Jibao, a middle peasant, proactively offered to help the landless poor peasant Liu Gongrong plow the land. Shao Yuling lent his livestock to Shao Jinju to use; He Wenjian lent Liu Rongxi, who had no food, two dou of mung beans; Liu Rongtai lent Shao Jinju two dou of corn. The water disaster in Shantang community was particularly severe, and there were also many who had no food to eat. The leftovers from each village were very small, so the existing grain funds of the cooperative, which was established with real money in the community, were first taken out and distributed to households with production difficulties. The twelve yokes of cattle in the Houwang family were modified to be used with a ringing sound; instead of using livestock to push the millstone, people pushed the millstone; some poor peasants exchanged human power for animal power. Using the above methods, the difficulties of life and cultivation are specifically resolved. (Zhang Yilin)

　　元朝三六区具体想办法
  　解决困难推动春耕
    【元朝消息】三区干部检查了当前群众生产中的困难，如无土地、无饭吃、无法种地等，区委会根据实际情况，研究了解决办法：（一）对于无土地种的贫雇，尤其穷庄小村，几年来土地问题未得很好解决。这次清理了果实尾巴地、学校机关占用地、村级部门的种地、及族地（分族地要经动员，在自愿情况下拿出来，否则惹起全族院不满。）共计二百七十八亩，庄场七亩，已分到缺少地的农民手里。如区机关学校的土地二十一亩，完全都分给无斗争内容的小刘庄。苗头村的家族地，以前在中农手里，经动员他们自愿转到无地种的贫雇手里。这样使一部分无地种的贫雇有了地种。（二）对于贫雇吃饭问题的解决办法：积极动员号召加强副业活动，组织打墙、打油、开木料厂、贩卖等，区村干部亲自帮助。资本来源，有的集资，分果实尾巴，贷款等，例如邵店子编粪筐的占多数，有的一天能编十二个，赚洋一千二百元。化庄马东鄂卖豆腐光渣子就够吃的。北刘店王德封担菜两趟，赚玉米一大斗。（三）关于耕地问题的解决：一、使草换畜力。贫雇把草给有牲口的户换畜力，喂牲口户因无草也感困难，换到草后，可以保持住不卖牲口。二、动员贫农主动找有牲口的，中贫农进行互助等价换工。三、村干起模范作用，主动的给贫雇互助换工。北庄店村干给张二改耕种地，张二改家给他做针线活，有棉花时，给他拾棉花。动员群众伙买牛。根据以上办法，贫雇的困难作到了初步解决。（荣光、文华、心林、保全、学书）
    【又息】元朝六区五十八个村中，没饭吃的约二百七十五户，九百一十五口人。目下播种时间已到，解决这问题是贫雇当前的迫切要求。领导上已动员全体干部多方设法去解决。如杨家村是从清理果实尾巴和树款中，解决了十七户贫雇的当前困难。榆林村没饭吃的贫雇，是从中贫农阶级友爱上打通思想，用私人自由借贷关系，解决了吃饭与耕地困难。如刘纪保是个中农，主动的提出帮助无牲口的贫农刘功荣犁地。邵玉岭的牲口借给邵金聚使用；何文见借给没吃的刘荣西吉豆二斗；刘荣太借给邵金聚玉米二斗。山堂小区水灾特别严重，没有饭吃的也很多，各村的果实尾巴又很少，将该小区前用现实成立的合作社现存的粮款，先拿出来分给生产有困难的户。后王家共十二犋牲口，改响使用，不用牲口推碾磨、用人推磨，有的贫农以人力换畜力。用以上办法，具体的去解决生活与耕地困难。（张宜林）
