　　Meetings in the County are Useless; Village Cadres Still Laze About
  　Yangcheng Second District's Production is Sluggish
    [Yangcheng News] The masses in the Second District are generally lazy in production, just planting things haphazardly. This was the report on the situation in each village at the Ninth District meeting. Since reading the Administrative Office's proclamation "Whoever plants it, harvests it," on the surface, things have started moving. For example, Mintou has already started planting grain and cotton. Chongshang Village has few livestock, so people are pulling plows to plow over 200 mu of land. However, the masses' worries have not been eliminated, and the misunderstandings of the middle peasants have not been dispelled; they are still afraid of "equalizing the piles." Some middle peasants say, "Is it really insured?" Others say, "Let's wait and see if we have enough to eat after this season." Some are even more discouraged, saying, "If we work, we'll be accused of being greedy; if we don't work, they'll say we're resisting." Therefore, everyone is just planting things haphazardly. For example, some people in Hetou Village planted grain without applying manure. The dykes used to be repaired every year, but this year, if they collapse, people just kick them a bit and leave it at that. Some villages don't even feed their livestock properly when plowing. One household in Xiakong Village has five livestock, but they just drive them to the hillside every day to find some grass and don't feed them anything else, so they are all very thin. Zhangxun Village has lost 20 livestock from winter to now. The masses' enthusiasm for production is very low. The county has already held meetings to correct this deviation. Why can't things be turned around? The main reason is that many cadres who returned from meetings in the county only talked about who plants it, harvests it, but did not properly publicize the policy towards middle peasants, and did not properly mobilize the masses for spring plowing. For example, after the cadres of Shiyuan returned, they only talked about new tasks and new styles, and did not mobilize production for six days. In the past, Xiakong sealed the doors of four middle peasant households, and Qishan sealed two; they have not been opened yet. Many middle peasants do not understand our policy of not harming the interests of middle peasants, and do not know that all livestock and farm implements of middle peasants are not allowed to be touched; they still think we are going to disrupt and equalize everything.

　　县上开会没顶事　村干依然在躺着
  　阳城二区生产懒洋洋的
    【阳城消息】二区群众生产，一般还是懒洋洋的，马马虎虎种上就算了。这是九号区上汇报各村的情况。大家自从读了行署“谁种谁收”的布告，从表面上看是动开了，象泯头已经开始种谷种棉。崇上村牲口少，用人拉犁犁地二百多亩，可是群众的心病并没去掉，中农误会并没消除，还是怕“平圪堆”。有的中农说“不保险吧”，有的说“抓摸上一季有了吃再说”，有的更泄气说“干吧，要吃家伙，不干吧，说咱跟人家制气呢！”所以大家只是胡乱种上就算了。比如河头村有些人不上粪就把谷种上了。往时年年修地＠，今年＠塌了用脚踹踹就算了。有些村犁地时还不好好喂牲口。下孔村一户有五个牲口，天天赶到坡上寻点草吃就再不喂了，饿的都很瘦。章训村从年时冬天到现在就死了廿头牲口。群众生产情绪很低。对这种偏向，县上已开会纠正。为什么老扭不过来呢？主要原因：很多从县上开会回去的干部，光谈了一下谁种谁收，没好好宣传对中农的政策，不好好动员群众春耕。比如石苑干部回去后，空谈新任务新作风，谈了六天还不动员生产。下孔以前封了四户中农的门，凄善封了两户，到现在还没开门。许多中农不了解我们不伤害中农利益的主张，也不知道所有中农的牲口、农具等，都不准动，还认为要打乱平圪堆。
