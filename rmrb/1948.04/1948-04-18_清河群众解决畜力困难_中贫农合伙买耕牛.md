　　Qinghe Masses Solve Livestock Power Difficulties
  　Middle and Poor Peasants Jointly Buy Oxen
    [Our Newspaper Message] In some villages in Qinghe, the masses are solving the problem of livestock shortages in production by having middle and poor peasants jointly buy oxen. In Dazhai Village, Third District, poor peasants were reluctant to use what they had been allocated, saving food and fuel, and thirty-five families jointly bought nine oxen and one donkey. Some three families bought one together, and some four families bought one. After feeding the livestock, they happily said, "We have never raised cattle in our many lifetimes, but now we all have shares in cattle." Some then said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's leadership, how could we afford to buy cattle? Poor people are one family. Now that we have cattle, we must first plow for the elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned who don't have cattle, so that they can also use cattle to cultivate the land!" Having cattle but no farm tools, they consulted with the village head and the head of the farmers' association, planning to borrow farm implements from the association. That afternoon, they held a mass meeting, and everyone said, "People (poor peasants) save money to buy cattle, but they can't work without furniture!" Immediately, plows, harrows, rakes, harnesses, etc., from the farmers' association were taken out and lent to these poor peasants. Everyone was very happy to receive the farm implements, and they immediately used beans to exchange for nine thousand catties of bean cake. With livestock, farm implements, and fertilizer all available, they are stepping up their efforts to move forward. Yang Bohua and Yang Boyan, middle peasants from Yangdouwu, First District, felt that jointly raising a calf was not enough, so they sold the calf at a meeting in a neighboring village and exchanged it for a large ox. Village head Yin Caihua called on everyone at a mass meeting, "Our village has forty-eight poor peasant families and three hundred and sixty-two mu of land. Let's discuss buying oxen together." He took the lead by jointly buying an ox with Zhang Jindong. Then eight families jointly bought four oxen, and many others are also preparing to buy together.
    [Our Newspaper Message] Cadres from the Second District of Guangping helped the masses organize mutual aid to solve the difficulty of not having livestock during the spring plowing. Lizhuang Village, Second District, is one of the villages most severely affected by flooding. Because of the lack of livestock and food, the masses were not enthusiastic about spring plowing, and seventeen qing and eleven mu of barren land were left unplowed. Based on the specific situation and the thinking of the masses, the district cadres conducted in-depth propaganda and organized five mutual aid teams, eliminating four qing and seventy mu of barren land in five days. Li Yaoxian's team of four people used a small ox to pull the plow, and they could plow more than two mu per day. Li Yaocun's team of six people pulled the plow for three shifts a day, and they could plow about four mu per day. Some teams helped each other push manure, and some teams helped each other dig land. Their morale was high, breaking the masses' reliance on livestock. Many poor peasants in Donghubao were also worried about not having livestock, not having enough to eat, and not being able to plow the land. The poor peasant Wu Huilie had eleven mu of barren land that he couldn't plow. The district cadres convened a meeting of poor peasants, asking everyone to discuss how to plow the barren land. Everyone discussed for a long time, and they all felt that mutual aid was essential. That evening, a mutual aid team was established. To take care of the elderly and weak, three children, two elderly, and three semi-able-bodied people participated in the team of ten. When they went to the fields, they first pulled the plow for Wu Huilie. The district cadres also participated and took the lead in pulling the plow, plowing one mu and three fen of land in one shift. Wu Huilie happily said, "Without mutual aid and without livestock, we would never be able to plow." He was determined to pull the plow and plow all the barren land.

　　清河群众解决畜力困难
  　中贫农合伙买耕牛
    【本报消息】清河有些村庄，群众为了解决生产中的牲口困难，中农贫农互相合伙买牛。三区大寨村的贫农分了东西舍不得用，省吃俭烧，三十五家合伙买了九头牛一匹驴。有的三家伙买一个，有的四家伙买一个。喂上了牲口都喜的说：“咱多少辈子也没喂过牛，咱这会都有了牛股了。”有的接着就说：“要不是毛主席领导，咱凭啥能买牛。穷人是一家，咱有了牛，得先给没牛的老弱孤寡种上，叫他们也使牛种种地吧！”有了牛还没农具，便跟村长农会主任商量，打算借农会里的家具使，当天下午开了群众会，大家都说：“人家（贫农）分了东西省着买牛，没有家具也没法做活呀！”随即就把农会里的犁、耙、耧、套等都拿出来借给这些贫农使。借到了家具，大家高兴得很，随即又用豆子换了九千斤豆饼，牲口、家具、肥料一应俱全，正在加紧向前干。一区杨豆坞中农杨伯华和杨伯延伙喂一头小牛嫌不顶事，就在邻村会上把小牛卖了换大牛。尹才花村长在群众大会上号召：“咱村四十八家贫农，三百六十二亩地，咱们商量着搭伙买牛吧”。自己首先和张金栋伙买了一个牛，接着就有八家伙着买了四个牛，还有许多也都在准备伙买。
    【本报消息】广平二区区干部帮助群众组织互助，解决春耕中没牲口的困难。二区李庄是水淹最苦的一个村子，因为没牲口没粮食，群众对春耕不带劲，十七顷十一亩白地搁着没犁。区干部根据具体情况和群众思想，深入宣传，组织成五个互助组，五天消灭白地四顷七十亩。李耀先组四个人配一个小牛拉犁，每天可犁二亩多。李耀存组六个人，一天三晌拉犁，每天能犁四亩左右，有的组互助推粪，有的组互助掘地，情绪很高，打破了群众依靠牲口的思想。东胡堡很多贫农也是愁着没牲口、没啥吃、地犁不起来，贫农武会烈就有十一亩白地没办法。区干部便召集贫农开会，叫大家讨论怎样才能把白地犁起来，你一言我一语圪嚷半天，都觉得非互助起来不行。当天晚上就成立了一个互助组，为了照顾老弱，十个人中，有三个儿童、两个老年三个半劳力参加进来。下地就先给武会烈拉犁，区干部也参加带头拉犁，一晌拉了一亩三分地。武会烈高兴的说：“要不互助、又没牲口，啥时候也犁不起来。”决心拉犁把所有白地犁完。
