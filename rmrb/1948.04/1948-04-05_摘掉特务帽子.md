　　Removing the "Special Agent" Label

　　In the past, in many villages, some bad village cadres and their cliques, due to personal grudges and revenge, falsely accused others of being special agents; there were also those who, without investigation and research, made groundless accusations and arbitrarily labeled good people as special agents. Those who were falsely accused were, of course, unable to appeal their grievances, and the masses, unable to distinguish truth from falsehood, dared not intervene, creating a serious phenomenon of public panic and unease about production. This mistake of "lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet" must be corrected. In the villages of the Ninth District of Wu'an that are carrying out Party consolidation and rectification work, they have grasped the demands of the masses, and from the very beginning, they have paid attention to this issue. After mobilizing the masses, they have combined with the masses to conduct investigations and research. Each case has been thoroughly reviewed, and those for whom there is no evidence are publicly stripped of the "special agent label." The masses generally agree with this, which has strengthened unity among them and enhanced the Party's prestige among the masses. This approach is worth emulating in other regions.

　　However, carrying out this work must not lead to paralysis or laxity in anti-espionage work. On the contrary, we must strengthen the masses' responsibility for anti-espionage, and turn the phenomenon of a few people or only the public security officer handling everything into a mass anti-espionage movement. In this way, we can more thoroughly protect the security of the emancipated masses and prevent the sabotage activities of Chiang Kai-shek's agents. But past mistakes should not be repeated. The phenomena of extracting confessions through torture, indiscriminate labeling and beating, and arbitrary forced confessions without evidence must be overcome. If there is conclusive evidence that someone is indeed a special agent or has major suspicions of being a special agent, it must be promptly reported to the higher authorities for consideration and handling. Villages must not detain them privately, and even more, are not allowed to conduct beatings or struggles. Because the harm that real special agents cause to the masses is not limited to the scope of one village or district, one village or district should not and cannot handle it without authorization.

### 摘掉特务帽子

　　摘掉特务帽子
    过去许多村庄，有些坏村干及其小集团，因私人挟嫌报复，诬陷别人为特务；亦有不经调查研究，捕风捉影，武断好人为特务者。被诬者固然冤屈难申，群众亦因不辨真伪不敢过问，造成人心惶惑，不安心生产的严重现象。这种搬起石头打自己的脚的错误，必须加以纠正。武安九区进行整党填补工作的村庄，抓住了群众要求，一开始即注意到了这一问题，并于群众发动起来之后，即结合群众，进行调查研究，每一案件，都经过详细审查，确无证据者，即当众摘掉“特务帽子”，群众对此都很同意，增强了群众之间的团结，提高了党在群众中的威信，这种作法，值得各地取法。
    但进行这一工作，绝不能引起对防奸工作的麻痹松懈；反之，要加强群众防奸的责任，把过去由少数人或只由公安员一人包办的现象，成为群众性防奸运动。这样，才能更周密的保护翻身群众的安宁，杜绝蒋特的破坏活动。但过去的错误不应重复，屈打成招，乱扣乱打，不凭证据，任意逼供的现象必须克服；如有真凭实据，被认为确系特务或有重大特务嫌疑者，必须迅速报告上级斟酌处理，各村不得私自扣押，更不许进行吊打斗争。因为真正的特务，其给予群众的危害，不仅一村一区的范围，因此一村一区，不应也不能擅自处理。
