Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Budapest - The entire nation of Hungary enthusiastically celebrated the third anniversary of its liberation on the 4th. The celebration rally in Budapest was held at Heroes' Square, presided over by Hungarian President Tildy himself, along with government officials. The Soviet military delegation led by Soviet High Commissioner for Austria, Kurasov, Soviet Ambassador Pushkin, and foreign envoys attended the ceremony. Deputy Prime Minister Szakasits delivered a speech on behalf of the government. Szakasits first paid tribute to the Soviet military delegation, which was met with unanimous applause and cheers. In his speech, Szakasits pointed out: "April 4, 1945, is the most glorious day in Hungarian history. Hungary has gained freedom from fascist enslavement and the opportunity for reconstruction, which is thanks to the powerful Soviet army. They came to Hungary not as conquerors, but as friends of the Hungarian people." After thanking the Soviet army for liberating Hungary, President Tildy concluded his remarks by paying tribute to Stalin. On the same day, Hungarian Communist Party General Secretary Rákosi addressed a crowd of 100,000 people at a celebration rally in Sárospatak, northern Hungary, recounting the victories of the Hungarian people's democracy over the past three years, saying: "The Hungarian working class is increasingly supporting the Hungarian Communist Party. In the past two months, tens of thousands of industrial workers and many farmers and intellectuals have joined the Hungarian Communist Party. Hungarian farmers fully support the democratic regime because they have personally seen that this regime can guarantee peace and order and has the conditions for building the country. The consolidation of the Hungarian democratic regime can be proven by the formation of the women's and youth united front. The National Independence Front has all the conditions to lead the Hungarian People's Democratic Republic, and continue with new strength the work that has not yet been completed due to the sabotage of the reactionaries. The reactionaries have completely failed." Rákosi also condemned the U.S. imperialism's interference in the Italian elections and firmly stated, "We do not believe there will be a war," because "the problem is not only determined by capitalists and arms manufacturers. The powerful Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are the best guarantee of peace."

　　匈牙利人民庆祝解放三周年
    【新华社陕北十二日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利全国于四日热烈庆祝解放三周年。匈京庆祝大会在英雄广场举行，由匈总统梯尔第亲率政府官员主持，苏联驻奥高级专员库拉索夫率领之苏军代表团，苏大使普士金及各外国使节均莅场观礼。大会由副总理斯查卡西兹代表政府致词，斯氏首向苏军代表团致敬，全场一致鼓掌欢呼。斯氏演说指出：“一九四五年四月四日是匈牙利历史上最光荣的日子，匈牙利已从法西斯奴役下获得自由，并获得复兴建设的机会，这应归功于强大的苏军，他们不是以征服者的姿态，而是以匈牙利人民友人的姿态来到匈牙利的。”梯尔第总统于感谢苏军解放匈牙利之后，结语中并向斯大林致敬。同日匈共总书拉科西在匈北萨罗斯巴达克城十万人举行的庆祝大会上，向群众演说，历述三年来匈牙利人民民主的胜利称：“匈牙利工人阶级愈来愈拥护匈共，过去两个月中，成万的产业工人与许多农民和知识分子加入了匈共；匈牙利农民完全拥护民主政权，因为他们亲眼看到这一政权能够保障和平秩序，并具备建设国家的条件。匈民主政权的巩固，可从妇女及青年统一战线之组成获得证明。民族独立阵线已具备了领导匈牙利人民民主共和国的一切条件，以新的力量继续进行因反动派的破坏而尚未完成的工作。反动派已完全失败了。”拉科西并痛斥美帝干涉意大利大选，并坚决表示“不相信有战争。”因为“问题并不只是由资本家和军火工业家决定的，强大的苏联与人民民主国家是和平最好的保障。”
