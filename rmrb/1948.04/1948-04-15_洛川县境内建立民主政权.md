　　Luochuan County
  　Democratic Government Established
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th dispatch】After the People's Liberation Army reached the territory of Luochuan County, it tightly surrounded the enemy troops defending the city. The work teams immediately led the masses near the suburbs of the city to establish a democratic government. In Luosheng District, after six days of deliberation by villagers in three townships and twenty-two villages, all elected their village heads and deputy village heads, and announced the abolition of the feudal Baojia system. The household registration plates, identity cards, five-household joint responsibility pledges, and patrol signs used to bind the people during the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan rule were burned. The two elected township heads and deputy township heads are now leading the masses in spring plowing, adjusting food rations for poor farmers, and organizing stretcher transport to support the front lines. Inspired by the lenient policies of the democratic government, more than 20 former township heads, Bao chiefs, and Bao police officers in the district came over one after another within ten days, surrendering 57 rifles and many grenades.

    【新华社西北十三日电】人民解放军进抵洛川县境后，即将该城守敌紧紧包围，工作队即在城郊附近，领导群众，建立民主政权。洛生区三乡二十二个村，经过村民六天酝酿，全部选出了正副村长，并宣布废除封建的保甲组织，将蒋胡统治时期用以束缚人民的门牌、身份证、五家连座结状及巡查牌等加以焚毁。已选出之正副乡长二人，现正领导群众进行春耕，给贫苦农民调剂口粮，组织担架运输支援前线。在民主政府宽大政策感召下，该区十天内即有伪乡长、保长、保警队员等廿余人相率来归，缴出步枪五十七支及手榴弹多枚。
