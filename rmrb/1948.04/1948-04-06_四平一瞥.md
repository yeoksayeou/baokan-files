　　A Glimpse of Siping
　　Huashan
　　On the morning of the 13th, the reporter passed through layers of fortifications and debris in the Three Woods area, entering the city from the northern gate breakthrough. At the time, the last fierce battle was taking place in the city center, but calm smoke was already rising from the dim and bullet-scarred residences.

　　For half a month, the defending enemy had forbidden residents from lighting fires or lamps. Fortresses and barbed wire blocked every intersection, and enemy soldiers prohibited residents from taking a single step outside their homes. Now, residents were stepping over obstacles lying in the mud, carrying sacks of rice from the fortress fortifications back to their homes, cutting meat from dead horses in the 88th Division barracks, and using the wood from abatis and broken bunkers to cook breakfast. “I haven't eaten such good food in two years,” a craftsman told me.

　　The railway station, running north-south across the city, was bustling with groups of railway workers, digging up mines and inspecting materials. It used to be a huge junction yard with sixty trains coming and going every day, but now it was full of immobile locomotives, rust-covered carriages, and dilapidated railway buildings. “Our rear areas were like this before,” said veteran workers from the old liberated areas, “we repaired them ourselves.” As soon as the general offensive began, they closely followed the fighting troops, personally guarding more than thirty locomotives under fire, ensuring that all materials remained intact. They also found local railway employees in the caves and introduced them to their work experiences in the liberated areas. These Siping workers, who had been unemployed for more than a year, were busy collecting parts and digging out tools buried in the ground. Siping railway workers who had scattered to make a living also rushed back to sign up, and within five days, the number of restored workers reached 5,000, reaching the peak record of the puppet Manchukuo era.

　　On the afternoon of the 20th, the reporter entered the city for the second time. Chimneys near the Tianqiao (Overpass) were already smoking, small generators were roaring in factories penetrated by artillery shells, and electrical workers were stringing lines on poles. A small merchant ran across the street through the mud, shouting in a drawn-out voice: "Buying light bulbs at high prices!" The Tianqiao's south side was filled with vendors, extending from the original Japanese residential area on the west side of the road to the market on the east side. The once gloomy and terrifying fortress zone in the city center had now become a bustling open-air market. "Red money is 400 yuan per catty, white money is 4,000 yuan per catty," citizens called Northeast banknotes "red money" and puppet Nine Provinces currency "white money." The exchange rate between the two changed from the original one to five to one to ten, one to fifteen, and by the 21st, it was uncertain. A customer, red-faced, shouted, "Others sell it for 60,000 yuan, why are you selling it for 80,000?" The vendor coldly replied, "You give me red money, I only want 4,000. Go spend this white money in Shenyang!"

　　The entrance to the reception center of the Public Security Bureau was crowded with soldiers wearing dirty American-style broken military uniforms and enemy lightly wounded soldiers with crutches. A group of wounded soldiers crammed into a bathhouse were driven out by the people as soon as the battle ended. The staff chased them away, cursing, "This isn't your time anymore." A month ago, the Chiang bandits took pork for the New Year from people's homes, and the homeowners had to pretend not to see it. Now, the bandit officers and soldiers hiding everywhere are being driven out of the gate by the people. A cook from the 88th Division at the repatriation registration office pleaded with a mournful face, "Just let me be a civilian in Siping. I've been captured four times already. If I go to Shenyang, you'll catch me again sooner or later." Some permed-hair family members of the bandit army were crying and wanted to return to their mother's home in Zhengjiatun. When the 71st Army was stationed in Zhengjiatun, platoon leaders could forcibly buy a girl with two dan of military grain, and after being tired of playing with them, they could sell them to the big brothels in Shenyang and make a profit. They cried and said, "Please, liberate us and let us return to our mother's home. We won't follow those disastrous troops anymore."

　　The reporter couldn't move forward on the muddy road. An old man reached out and pulled me onto the steps. He had been a stonemason on this street for eleven years and had personally paved this road. He said, "The street used to be smooth and clean. The Kuomintang mayors were replaced three times, and each of them left with their pockets full of money, leaving garbage everywhere—comrade, can you tell this is a stone road?" The original trees on both sides were also cut down by them to build fortifications. He said excitedly, "As long as you say the word to start construction, I'll be the first to sign up."

　　四平一瞥
    华山
    十三日清晨记者穿过三道林子的层层工事残骸，从北门突破口走进市区，当时市中心正进行着最后一阵激战，但灰暗而弹痕累累的住宅，已经升起平静的炊烟。
    半月以来，守敌不让居民升火和点灯，堡垒和铁丝网卡住每个路口，敌兵禁止居民出门一步。现在居民们跨过瘫卧在泥水里的障碍物，把堡垒工事里的一袋袋大米扛回家去，割下八十八师兵营里的死马肉，用鹿砦和破地堡的木料煮成早饭。“两年来没吃过这样好的饭了。”一个工匠对我说。
    横贯市区南北的火车站，穿行着一群群铁路工人，他们在挖掘地雷，视察物资。那里曾经是每天进出六十趟列车的巨大岔道场，现在停满了僵死的机关车，盖满红锈的车皮和残破的铁路建筑物。“咱后方早先也是这样”，老解放区来的工友们说：“都是咱自己动手修复的”。总攻刚刚开始，他们便紧随战斗部队，亲自在炮火下守卫三十几个车头，使全部资材得以完好无损。他们并从地洞里找出当地的铁路员工，向他们介绍自己在解放区工作的情形。这些失业了一年多的四平工友，纷纷收拾零件，挖出埋在土里的工具。四散求生的四平铁路职工，也纷纷赶回报名，五天内复业人数有五千之多，达到了伪满全盛时代的纪录。
    二十日下午，记者第二次进城，天桥附近的烟囱已经冒烟了，小型发电机在炮弹穿透了的工厂里吼着，电汽工人正在杆头掣线。一个小商人在街上踏着泥水跑过，拉长嗓子喊：“高价收买灯泡！”天桥南侧摆满了摊贩，一头摆到道西的原日本住宅区，另一头和道东市场接在一起。不久之前曾是阴森恐怖的中心街市堡垒地带，现在已变成喧闹的露天市场。“红钱四百元一斤，白钱四千元一斤”，市民把东北本币叫做“红钱”，伪九省流通券叫做“白钱”，两者比值由原来一比五变成一比十、一比十五，到二十一号就没准头了。一个顾客挣红了脸嚷着：“旁人卖六万元，你为啥卖八万？”摊贩冷冷回答说：“你拿红钱，我只要四千，这白钱上沈阳花去吧！”
    警备司令部的解放官兵收容处门口，挤满了穿着污黑的美式破军装的士兵和拄着拐杖的敌轻伤员。一群挤住在一家澡堂里的伤兵，战斗刚结束就被老百姓哄出大门，伙计们边撵边骂道：“这可不是你们的时候了。”一月以前蒋匪进民家拿走过年的猪肉，房主还得装着看不见，现在到处躲藏的匪官兵，却被老百姓赶出大门。遣送登记处有个八十八师的伙夫，哭丧着脸请求道：“就让我在四平当老百姓得了，我连这次当了四次俘虏，到沈阳去，迟早还要让你们抓回来。”一些烫发的匪军家属，哭着要回郑家屯娘家去，原来七十一军盘踞郑家屯时，班排长用两石军粮就可强买一个姑娘，玩厌了把她们卖到沈阳大窑子，又可以赚一笔钱，她们哭着说：“行个好，解放咱回娘家吧，再不跟那遭殃军了。”
    记者在稀泥汤的路上迈不开腿，一个老百姓伸手拉我跳上台阶，他曾在本街做了十一年石匠，亲自铺过这条马路，他说：“早先街上都是光溜明净的，国民党市长换了三个，一个个装满钱袋走了，扔下遍地垃圾——同志你看得出这是石子路吗？”两旁原来的林荫现在也都叫他们砍倒修工事去了。他兴奋的说：“只要你们说声动工，我头一个报名。”
