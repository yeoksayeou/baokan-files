　　Solving Problems Within the Party Combined with Mobilizing the Masses
  　Successful Completion of Party Rectification in Zhao Village
    Promoting Correct Opinions of the Masses; Correcting Radical Revengeful Sentiments
    Examining the Actions and Conduct of Party Members During Accounting and Reception
    Great Gains from Rectification Within the Masses; Improved Party-Masses Relations
    [Our Dispatch] The Party rectification work in Zhao Village, after undergoing three stages: combining internal party reflection and rectification with reorganizing the mass ranks, combining public accounting, production assessment, land measurement, and evaluation of compensation with examining the conduct of party members, has improved the relationship between the Party and the masses. This has created the experience of boldly mobilizing the masses for party rectification while grasping policies, seizing the opportunity, enhancing the awareness of the masses, boldly guiding the masses to conduct self-education, liberating a portion of the masses from prejudice, treating the handling of party member discipline with caution and responsibility, and avoiding wrongly punishing a single party member.
    The Party rectification work in Zhao Village, from the first stage of mobilizing party members to reflect within the branch, entering the stage of announcing the Party's openness at village meetings, implementing the combination of internal Party resolution and mass resolution, the combination of reasoning within the Party and pressure from the masses, mobilizing the masses to raise opinions, sending representatives to participate in branch meetings to assist in party rectification, and the Poor Peasants' League examining the first batch of party members (see this newspaper's February 29th report on the examination of party members by the masses in Zhao Village), up to the Poor Peasants' League representatives examining the second batch of party members on February 17th, democratic party rectification gradually formed a village-wide high tide in Zhao Village. This high tide was formed in the process of reorganizing the mass ranks (after the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League, poor and middle peasants connected to establish the New Peasants’ Association). Due to the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League, the middle and poor peasants broke through the concerns that it was still "washing faces and blackening hearts," and saw that the party member cadres were more humble than each other, their heads were no longer as shiny as before, and they all came down from their positions. Even poor laborers who had not spoken for many years, such as Jin Fu, dared to speak. Some people with sectarian revengeful sentiments became even more active, vying to speak, creating irresistible pressure on party member cadres from the masses. On the night of February 16th, mass meetings were held in each street to raise opinions on the second batch of ten party members handed over to the masses for examination. That night, each poor peasant group selected three to five representatives, carrying everyone's opinions, to participate in the branch meeting on the 17th for formal criticism and examination. During the day, six party members were examined, three were passed, and three were returned. In general, this examination showed that most of the poor laborer representatives had a particularly cautious and loving attitude towards the handling of party members. However, the radical emotions of a small number of people still prevailed, turning party members who spoke well at arguing and had a bad attitude into "bullies" and "dictators," turning adultery into "raping civilian women," and turning charging higher prices for mending pots into "exploiting the masses..." The meeting was always tense, and after the meeting, party members discussed one after another, saying, "As long as you reflect well, the masses will forgive you; if you don't reflect well, you won't pass." This promoted further reflection by party members. Li Buming's reflection report to the branch that night had a very good attitude. Other party members said, "If it weren't for this meeting, he wouldn't be able to reflect like this." However, on the other hand, due to some human nature views among the masses, some said that someone "was born that way, with a bad heart!" Some people isolated some mistakes of party members, completely pushing the shortcomings of the other party involved onto the party member; or they regarded the general shortcomings of peasants as only the shortcomings of party members, even bringing up the shortcomings of party members one or twenty years before joining the party, regardless of their size. This also made party members feel that the masses always said they were not qualified as party members, feeling like there was no way out. When the leaders asked them to think about how to solve their own problems, they collectively cried. At this time, some honest poor laborers were also dissatisfied with the sectarian revengeful biased opinions, but when they saw that the mistakes of the party members were not serious, they were embarrassed to pass them. They doubted how the responsible cadre party members should be dealt with, and expressed one after another, "We can't treat cadres like landlords!" "They were very active in leading the struggle! It's okay to correct mistakes." "We can't just complain about them. In the past, when we were asked to stand guard during the struggle, we didn't go. The cadres said, 'If you don't go, who will?' Thinking back, it's true. If we don't go, are we just going to ask them to go?!" Some honest middle peasants also said: We should treat cadres with "peace as the principle."
    This is an important juncture for Zhao Village to reverse the relationship between the Party and the masses. It is necessary to promote the correct opinions of honest poor laborers and some honest middle peasants towards party members, and guide the majority of the masses to consider the issue of handling party members more calmly from the prejudice of revengeful emotions. After research, the work team decided to temporarily suspend the review meeting, put the party members into mass movements to show themselves, and let the masses review their responsible cadre party members from their actions. After the new cadres are elected, they must carefully and seriously handle the handover of accounts. The size of the problems and whether they are determined to change must be seen from these practical actions. Non-responsible party members should be tested in mass self-criticism movements (poor peasant groups and middle peasants are both conducting this movement), election movements, and future compensation movements, letting them show the masses whether they can stand on the side of the masses, change their old work style, and withdraw the excess fruits, because the masses are most concerned about whether they can deliver on their promises. As for the issue of Party discipline, it was decided to allow both party members and the Poor Peasants' League to draft specific disciplinary opinions, meet each other, and then study and resolve them, and use this to educate and improve the Party's understanding of party members and the masses.
    On the afternoon of the day the New Peasants' Association was established (February 19th), a joint meeting of the Poor Peasants' League and the New Peasants' Association Committee was held to study how to assist in Party rectification, and it was decided to convene the Poor Peasants' League groups and members of the Peasants' Association separately in each street to draft opinions on the discipline of party members. At the same time, the branch also conducted self-drafted discipline, combined with the specific opinions of the masses, and carried out lectures on the Party and Party discipline, which not only educated the masses, but also educated the party members. Before this, not only did the masses not understand what the Party was, what Party discipline was, and what party members should do, but even party members did not understand the dignity of Party discipline. Many party members said: "Who knew this before? We made mistakes without knowing it!" "If we don't handle them separately, the masses will throw us off the cliff." The masses said: "The Communist Party's method is good, with tight control at each level. If it doesn't work at this level, it will work at that level. If it still doesn't work, we'll expel them. This way, no one will be wronged"; "Expelling a party member is like shooting a gun in the heart. Don't say it lightly. This is not a small matter!" However, the radical revengeful emotions of a small number of people still existed, always wanting to raise the discipline of party members with whom they had personal feuds very high. For example, Fang Jingui of the Third Street was the "locomotive" during the "washing faces and blackening hearts" last year. Because he was retaliated against by the cadre, he was dissatisfied with Qin Director Jin Guoquan. Whenever the discipline of Jin Guoquan and other party member cadres was mentioned, he said: "These nephews! Expelling them from the Party is not enough. Send them to the People's Court to sentence them to imprisonment." Mao Er suspected that Jin Tongyuan had framed his nephew by cutting green seedlings. When others mentioned severely disciplining Jin Tongyuan: "Expel him from the Party, confiscate his property, and throwing him under the dog's cliff is not a loss!" He felt very satisfied. When Jin Cunze, a party member, was mentioned, he said: "Let the wolves eat him!" There were many similar opinions, but most of the masses did not sympathize with these opinions, and said: "This is just your opinion." "Cadres are all from poor peasant backgrounds. Their butts are dirty and must be wiped clean. If you wipe them hard, they will bleed." "They led the masses to turn over, and if they make mistakes, they can't be seen as landlords. They can't be flogged!" Therefore, the discipline proposed for party members was generally more cautious, and some added questioning opinions: "His background and history are good, so why did he forget the poor when he became a cadre? What kind of ideology should he reflect on?" At this time, revengeful emotions were gradually suppressed, and the correct opinion of treating party members separately began to prevail in the minds of the masses. However, because the masses had not yet seen the real transformation of the party members from their actions, they were still easily influenced by the biased people. Therefore, the proposed disciplinary opinions were relatively high. Some groups advocated expelling eight, and one group even advocated expelling eleven party members. The opinions on the discipline of responsible cadres such as Jin Caiyuan, Jin Tongyuan, and Jin Suoze were even more severe, believing that after being expelled from the Party, they should be handed over to the People's Court to be sentenced to three to five years of imprisonment. In addition, seven party members were given probationary membership, plus warnings, admonitions, and other disciplines, accounting for more than half of all party members. The self-drafted disciplines of party members were generally quite strict, with many self-drafted probationary membership.
    After the establishment of the Peasants' Congress and the election of new village government committee members and village chiefs and deputy village chiefs, two days before the official handover of accounts (February 24th and 25th), the Poor Peasants' League representatives went to the branch again to help with Party rectification, asking everyone to raise opinions on them universally, and officially confirming the discipline of general party members (responsible cadres were not finally confirmed, and would be discussed after the handover of accounts). Because the new village cadres had taken office and the masses had become their own masters, everyone's fear of party members disappeared, and radical opinions were even fewer. A cautious and responsible calm attitude became the dominant force. The atmosphere of criticism at the meeting was completely normal. On the one hand, people spoke their minds without any worries; on the other hand, they did not exaggerate or take revenge. They saw that party members also criticized each other, and the previous view that party members were a swarm of bees changed, so everyone's emotions became more consistent. For those who reflected well, they all believed that the discipline should be reduced; for those who had a bad attitude, they resolutely criticized them to promote reflection and reform. Except for eight responsible cadres such as Jin Caiyuan, Jin Tongyuan, Jin Suoze, Yang Zhankui, and Xue Shuangsuo, the examination of most party members in the masses was successfully completed by this time.
    After the new cadres were elected, the whole village was very happy. At the election meeting, everyone proposed to speed up the handover and prepare for compensation. First of all, they unanimously demanded that "the accounts of the old cadres be settled." According to the demands of the masses, the new village cadres and the New Peasants' Association Committee discussed and decided to combine Party rectification with the handover work. In the process of handover, the behavior and ideological transformation of several responsible cadre party members were further examined.
    The method was: old and new cadres handed over accounts. They reported the daily handover situation to the masses in the evening, discussed the problems that occurred in the handover with the masses, and asked the masses to raise opinions and question items that everyone knew but were not encountered in the accounting. When problems that could not be solved in the accounting were encountered, mass meetings were held to raise opinions and rectify the Party.
    In the handover and accounting, the general process was smooth. Yang Zhankui, the village chief, managed the village public property, and the money was in the village's finance and production department, managed by Zhao Shunzi (a party member). The accounts were generally clear. The financial and grain accounts of Jin Tongyuan, the financial and grain director, only needed to be verified with the district office, and the procedures were clear, with no major problems. Xue Shuangsuo, the political director, had served as the director of the Peasants' Association for more than a year half a year ago. The masses trusted him to be honest, and originally thought there was nothing wrong, but they suspected his predecessor Li Bugui and wanted to carefully check the accounts. During the check, it was found that there was a yellow account summary sheet posted on the street in the account book, showing a balance of 300,000 yuan. After checking, there was no record of this amount in the account at that time. The masses asked: "Where did this money go?" Shuangsuo couldn't remember either. He didn't embezzle it himself, and couldn't answer the masses, so he anxiously went to the cooperative to cry. Zhang Shulin, the accountant of the cooperative, remembered that 290,000 yuan for buying soybeans last summer was deposited in the cooperative. He asked where it came from. After checking, it was that amount of money. He admitted to losing 10,000 yuan and compensated for it, and there was no problem.
    Originally, the masses imagined that Jin Caiyuan, who was the manager of the Handan store, must have embezzled money, but Jin's handover was generally clear and understandable. Only Jin Suoze, the director of the Peasants' Association, had messy accounts, and many things were not recorded. When the masses raised opinions, he said it was not right, and took out some things that were stored in his home, but some could not be found. In this way, suspicion and anger increased among the masses, and they raised questions one after another: "You reported at the mass meeting during the last movement that there were more than 17 catties of silverware, but now you only handed over 10.4 catties. Where did the more than 6 catties go?" "You confiscated the gold lockets from the objects of struggle, and haven't heard where they went?" Jin Suoze couldn't answer for a while, and the masses became more suspicious. The masses had long speculated: "Jin Suoze must have embezzled a lot!" The comrades of the Fifth Street work team said that the masses reflected: "Jin Suoze embezzled at least 1 million yuan." They also asked him: "You confiscated a lot of cash, but spent less. What did you do with the 45 yuan difference?" "If each object of struggle is counted as one bracelet, there should be seven or eighty of them. Where did these things go?" Jin Suoze felt a lot of pressure from the masses' questions, and he couldn't explain it himself. He just said: "I took out everything that was stored in my home. I can't explain why there is so much missing." The mass representatives were angry and helpless. In the evening, a joint meeting of the group was convened to discuss a solution. Everyone said: "The problem must be big." His bottom line is "I can't explain it." "He uses political prisoners to keep accounts (Jin often used a family that was being struggled against to keep accounts), so how could he have embezzled less?" "Let's calculate his family property to see where he got the money to buy houses and land!" "His child has to spend 1,000 yuan a day, let's calculate how much it is!" So the next day, they calculated Jin Suoze's family property, and raised many questions about buying houses and land and the child spending money. He answered them one by one, and none of them were embezzled. The masses felt a little discouraged and came up empty. After calculating for two days, they caught several loopholes: 45 yuan in cash, more than 6 catties of silverware, and a gold locket. They asked him if he had them. But after checking, two more were cleared up. The gold locket was found in the warehouse, and the missing cash was found in the cooperative account. The mistakes that everyone had caught came to nothing again, but the suspicion could not be removed (because Jin Suoze did have many things that were not recorded). Therefore, the masses felt annoyed with the accounting. In order to guide the masses to the right direction, the work team enlightened the masses not to raise opinions based on estimates and guesses, but to raise opinions based on specific facts. It was right to raise what the masses saw, and the purpose was to clarify the problem, not to find mistakes and get him to confess. This kind of opinion also emerged among the masses, believing that it was not right to just estimate. However, the suspicion of Jin Suoze still existed. "Where did the six catties of silverware go? How much else did he embezzle?" Jin Suoze himself also felt very anxious, and just said: "I am illiterate, and there are piles of things here and piles of things there. When the masses ask, I can't explain it!" He was distressed and helpless. At this point, the settlement of accounts and the handover came to an end, and the accounting was difficult to continue, so the Party rectification work turned to a more effective direction.
    By the beginning of this month, after discussion by the masses, party members were welcomed back to various mass organizations. In the work of land measurement and production evaluation, the work performance of party members was generally good. Jin Guoquan, the anti-resistance director, had many opinions on him before, but since participating in the land measurement and production evaluation work, the masses valued his work ability and experience. At the production evaluation meeting, when difficult problems were encountered, everyone always said: "Jin Guoquan, tell us what you think!" At this meeting, he was later elected as the chairman. When the Peasants' Association received the trees, the New Peasants' Association also entrusted him to be responsible for receiving the trees. He said: "I have been very happy at work these past two days!" Jin Suoze also said: "During the Party rectification period, the masses didn't even talk to me when they saw me. The unity was good during the land measurement." The masses' reaction to the party members said: "The party members have been doing a good job these past two days." "Those people (party members) still have some experience."
    After the land measurement was completed, Party rectification was resumed on March 26th to prepare for the conclusion of the Party rectification work. Because the masses and party members had made progress in their thinking, they were more rational in the relationship between the Party and the masses: 1. No more general liquidation of personal history, distinguishing between historical mistakes and mistakes and shortcomings in work. 2. Radical emotions have been reduced, separating public and private interests, reasoning and investigating thoughts, and the phenomenon of mutual criticism among the masses has been strengthened compared to before. The proposal for disciplinary action against party members is more rational and cautious. In the first mass proposal for disciplinary action against party members, Jin Caiyuan and Jin Tongyuan, who were proposed to be expelled from the Party, also believed that after being expelled from the Party, they should be handed over to the People's Court to be sentenced to three to five years of imprisonment; this time, when discussing Jin Caiyuan's problem, his mistakes when he was first expelled from the Party and after he rejoined the Party were distinguished, and it was proposed to give him a public warning. The crimes of Jin Tongyuan before joining the Party (killing people as a bandit) were separated from his progress after joining the Party: "To say that he has done nothing wrong since joining the Party, it's just that his attitude is not good. Let's give him a warning in person!" When the masses mentioned Li Wenke, the public security officer, they said: "This person is very evil. It is common for him to hang and beat people, and randomly put the hat of a spy on people. He should at least be expelled from the Party." This time, he reflected well and admitted his mistakes thoroughly. They also saw that many of his mistakes were due to public affairs, and not entirely his fault. But because he was good at retaliation, the masses said: "Give him a warning." Li Juitang, the former member of the Peasants' Association, also advocated expulsion from the Party last time, saying that he was Jin Caiyuan's "domestic general," his attitude was too bad, and he was an old rogue; this time, after calmly studying the matter, the rogue was before he joined the Party, and he changed after joining the Party. It was true that his attitude was not good, but it was not appropriate to give him too high a discipline for this reason. Fang Macheng of the Third Street said: "It is not appropriate to punish him just for his bad attitude." The whole group passed his opinion. Only Jin Suoze's problem has not been finally resolved because several catties of silverware have not been clarified, and there are many opinions from the masses. The masses clearly saw the transformation and progress of party members in the land measurement and production evaluation work, which had a great impact on the decision of disciplinary action against party members. When Jin Caiyuan was passed, the masses said: "He is responsible and meticulous in the land measurement. He determines the amount, whether large or small, only after three or four times. This is progress." For Jin Tongyuan, they said: "He used the abacus during the land measurement and often urged people to work non-stop. He worked hard and was very responsible."
    In the class division and evaluation of compensation, party members were very serious about returning the excess land, houses, and property, and compensating for what should be compensated. A total of more than 60 mu of land were returned. Jin Caiyuan wanted to donate a house and return 8 mu of self-purchased land. The calculation of production to be returned was not enough for the average number, and the masses wanted to compensate him with another 3 mu; Jin Hongzhang wanted to return nearly 4 mu of land, and the masses said that you two couples should be calculated as three people and can return 3 mu of distant land; Zhao Nuoshan (family member of a soldier, party member) voluntarily returned 10 rooms of buildings; Zhao Wenbin, a district cadre, wanted to return a new house. Because the old house was broken, the masses wanted to compensate him with wood and ask him to repair it. In this way, the problem of party members occupying too much fruit was resolved very harmoniously. The relationship between the Party and the masses has been further improved, and the emotions of party members and the masses have gradually blended. The Party rectification summary is now being conducted in conjunction with the implementation of compensation, reviewing the work of the branch in the past, and discussing how to carry out Party building work among the masses.

　　党内解决群众解决结合进行
  　赵庄整党顺利完成
    发扬群众正确意见　纠正偏激报复情绪
    考查党员行动作风　在算帐接收中
    整党群众中整党收获大　党群关系得到改善
    【本报消息】赵庄整党工作，经过在党内反盛整编群众队伍与整党结合，办交代、评产量、丈量土地、评议抽补与考查党员作风行动相结合等三个阶段，党群关系已经改善，创造了放手发动群众整党而又能掌握政策，抓紧火候，提高群众觉悟，放手诱导群众进行自我教育，使一部分群众从偏见中解脱出来，慎重负责对待处理党员处分，不冤枉处分一个党员的经验。
    赵庄整党工作，自从由第一阶段发动党员在支部内反省，进入到在村民大会上宣布党的公开，贯彻党内解决与群众解决相结合，党内说理与群众压力相结合，发动群众提意见，派代表参加支部会帮助整党，贫农团审查第一批党员（详见本报二月二十九日赵庄群众审查党员消息），以至到二月十七日贫农团代表审查第二批党员，民主整党在赵庄即逐渐形成了全村性的高潮。这个高潮，是在群众队伍的整编（贫农团成立后，进行串连中农准备成立新农会）的过程中形成的。由于贫农团的成立，中贫农打破了怕仍是“洗脸擦黑”的顾虑，而且看到党员干部一个比一个膀子低，头也没从前光了，都下了架子，连多年不吭气的贫雇，如靳福的等，也都敢讲话了。而一些带有宗派报复情绪的人也更为活跃起来，抢着说话，就造成了群众对党员干部不可抗的压力。二月十六日夜，各街分别召开群众大会，对第二批交给群众审查的十个党员提了意见，当晚由贫农小组各选三、五个不等的代表，携带大家意见，于十七日参加支部大会，正式进行批评与审查。进行一天，审查了六个党员，通过了三个，碰回来三个。这次审查，总的说来，表现了大多数贫雇代表对党员处理是特别慎重与爱护的态度；但一小部分人的偏激情绪还占着上风，把党员说话好抬杠，态度不好的，说成了“恶霸”“独裁”，把通奸行为说成了“强霸民女”，把补锅索价较高说成了“剥削群众……。”会议进行一直显的很紧张，会后党员纷纷议论说：“只要好好反省，群众就能原谅，不好好反省，就通不过。”这样就推动了党员进一步反省。李步明当天黑夜在支部的反省报告态度很好，其他党员说：“不是这个会，他可反省不到这样子。”但另一方面，由于群众中还有些人性论观点，说某人“是生就的，心不好！”还有些人把党员的一些错误孤立起来，把和他发生关系另一方面的缺点，也完全推到党员身上；或者把农民的一般缺点，认为只是党员的缺点，甚至把党员入党前一、二十年的缺点，不论大小都提了出来。也使党员感到群众动不动就说不够党员资格，觉得没路走，当领导上叫他们自己想想怎样解决自己的问题时，曾集体痛哭一场。而一部分老实贫雇这时对宗派报复的偏激意见，心中也有不满，但看到错误不大的党员，还不好通过，对负责的干部党员究竟要怎样处理？发生了疑虑，纷纷表示：“可不能象对待地主那样对待干部！”“人家领导斗争可积极哩！有过错能改就行。”“不能光怨人家，过去斗争的时候，叫咱去站岗，咱不去，干部起态度说：‘你不去叫谁去？’翻回来想：也是，咱不去，光叫人家去？！”一部老实中农也说：咱们对干部应作到“和平为直”。
    这是赵庄扭转党群关系的一个重要关节，需要发扬老实贫雇与一部分老实中农对待党员的正确意见，引导大多数群众从报复情绪的偏见中，更冷静地考虑处理党员问题。经过了研究，工作组决定把审查会暂时中止，把党员放到群众运动中去表现自己，让群众从党员的行动中审查他们负责的党员干部，要在新干部选出后好好认真办交代，问题大小，决心转变与否，都要从这些实际行动中去看。非负责的党员，则放到群众性的自我批评运动（贫农团与中农中都正进行这个运动）、选举运动与将来的抽补运动中去考验，让他们表现给群众看，是否能站在群众方面，改变旧的作风，退出多占果实，因为群众最关心的是能否兑现。至于党内处分问题，决定让党员与贫农团双方拟定具体处分意见，碰一碰头，然后研究解决，并借此教育提高党员与群众对党的认识。
    在新农会成立的当天下午（二月十九日），开贫农团与新农会委员联席会，研究如何帮助整党，决定在各街分别召集贫农团小组与农会会员一起拟定对党员处分意见。同时支部也进行自拟处分，结合群众的具体意见进行了讲党、讲党纪，不但教育了群众，而且也教育了党员。在这以前，不仅群众不了解党是什么，党纪是什么，党员该干啥？就是党员也不了解党纪的尊严，不少党员说：“以前谁知道这，咱糊里糊涂就犯了错误啦！”“不分别处理，群众还不把咱扔到崖底下去。”群众说：“共产党的办法好，一层一层管得紧，不在这一层在那一层，不行了再开除，这样冤枉不了人”；“开除个党员，就等于朝着心口眼打了一枪，可不要乱说，这不是个小事呀！”但少数人的偏激报复情绪仍然存在，总想把给自己有私仇的党员处分提得很高。如三街房金贵，是去年“洗脸擦黑”时的“火车头”，因受到干部报复，对抗勤主任靳国全不满，一提到对靳国全及其他党员干部的处分时，就说：“这些妻侄！开除党籍还不行，送人民法庭判他徒刑”。毛二因怀疑靳同元割青苗陷害他侄子，当别人提到对靳同元严厉处分：“开除党籍，没收家产，扔狗儿的崖底下也不亏！”他感到很满意，提到党员靳存则，说：“叫狼吃了！”类似意见还有不少，但大多数群众对这些意见不同情，都说：“这是你一个人的意见”。“干部都是穷农出身，屁股有屎，非擦不行，硬擦会流血的”。“他们领导群众翻身，有过错也不能看成地主，不能吊打！”因此一般对党员所提出的处分比较慎重，有的附注质问意见：“成份历史好，为啥当了干部忘了穷人，可叫他反省啥思想？”这时报复情绪逐渐被压下去了，分别对待党员的正确意见，开始在群众的思想中占了上风。但由于群众还没有从行动中看到党员的真正转变，仍容易受少数偏见人的影响。因此所拟处分意见，都比较高，有的组主张开除八个，有一个组甚至主张开除十一个党员的党籍，对靳才垣、靳同元、靳锁则等负责干部处分的意见更为严厉，认为开除党籍后交人民法庭处三、五年不等的徒刑；另有七个党员予以留党查看处分，加上警告、劝告等处分的党员，要占全部党员半数以上。而党员自拟处分，一般也都相当严格，自拟留党察看的很多。
    在农代会成立、选举出新的村政府委员与正副村长之后，正式办交代的前两天（二月二十四、五日），又由贫农团代表到支部帮助整党，请大家对他们普遍提意见，并正式确定一下一般党员的处分（负责干部不作最后确定，办交代以后再说）。由于新村干已经上台，群众自己已当了家。所以大家对党员的害怕情绪没有了，偏激的意见也更少了，慎重负责的冷静态度成了主导力量。会场的批评空气是完全正常的，一方面有话就说，毫无顾虑；一方面也不危言耸听或偏激报复了。他们更看到党员对党员也互相展开批评，以前认为党员是一窝蜂的看法改变了，所以大家的情绪更一致起来，对反省态度好的，都认为应减轻处分；对态度不好的，则坚决批评，促其反省、改过，除靳才垣、靳同元、靳锁则、杨占魁、薛双锁等八个负责干部外，至此大部党员在群众中的审查工作乃顺利完成。
    新干部选出以后，全村群众都很高兴。在选举大会上大家就提出要赶快办理接收，准备抽补。首先一致要求“把旧干部的帐算清”。根据群众的要求，新村干与新农会委员一起讨论，决定整党和接收工作结合进行。在接收的过程中，进一步的考查几个负责干部党员的行为和思想转变的程度。
    方式是：新旧干部交代帐目。对每天接收的情况，晚上回到群众中去作报告，和群众商量在接收中所发生的问题，并由群众提出意见，追问大家所熟知，而在算帐中没有碰到的项目，在算帐中碰到不能解决的问题，就开群众大会提意见整党。
    在办交代算帐中，一般进行的还顺利。村长杨占魁所管村公产，钱都在村财政生产部，帐由赵顺子（党员）管理，大体都交代清楚。财粮主任靳同元的财粮帐，只须向区署对证，清楚手续，也无大问题。政治主任薛双锁，半年前任农会主任一年多，群众都信服他老实，原认为没有啥，但对他前任李步贵有怀疑，要仔细查算。在查算中发现帐本中夹有一个在街上贴的黄帐总结单，上结有存洋三十万元，查那时帐中没有落这一笔，群众问：“这钱那里去了？”双锁也想不起来，自己也没贪污，又无法答复群众，着急得到合作社去哭。合作社会计张树林想起去年夏天买豆子钱二十九万元，存在合作社，问他出在那里，一查就是那笔钱，脱一万元他承认赔上，也没问题。
    原来群众想象中，在邯郸商店任经理的靳才垣一定有贪污，但靳的交代，一般是清楚明白。只是农会主任靳锁则因为帐目零乱，有很多东西没有上帐，群众提出意见时，他说不对头，有些东西存在他家里的拿出来了，有的就找不到下落。这样，群众中增加了怀疑和气愤，纷纷提出责问：“你在上次运动时，在群众会上报告过，银器共有十七斤多，现在只交出十斤四两，还有六斤多到那里去了呢”？“你没收斗争对象的包金锁子，也没听说到那里去了？”靳锁则一时答不上来，群众就更加怀疑起来。群众中很久就普遍的猜测：“靳锁则贪污还不知有多大！”五街工作同志说群众反映：“靳锁则至少贪污一百万元”。还问他：“你没收的现洋多，出的少，差四十五块干啥了？”“一户斗争对象按一付手镯算，也该有七、八十付呀，这些东西那里去了？”靳锁则对群众的责问，感到很大的压力，自己又说不清楚，只是说：“存在我家中的东西，我都拿出来了，差了这么多，我也说不来。”群众代表又生气，又没办法。晚上召开小组联合会商量办法，大家说：“问题一定很大”，他底卢“说不清格”，“用政治犯记帐（靳常用一个被斗户记帐），还能贪污的少了？”“给他算算家当，看他买房子、地，那里来的钱！”“他孩子一天就得花一千元，算算有多少吧？”于是第二天就给靳锁则算家当，纷纷提出许多责问，买房子、地、孩子花钱，他一一解答了，都不是贪污的，群众觉得有点泄气，扑空了。这样算了两天，又抓住四十五元现洋、六斤多银器，包金锁子几个漏洞，问他究竟有没有？但一查对，又有两个查清楚了，从库房里把金锁子找出来了，差的现洋从合作社帐上找出来了。大家所抓的错误又落了空，但怀疑心理去不掉（因靳锁则确有很多东西没有上帐），因此群众对算帐感到烦燥。工作组为了诱导群众走向正确，曾启发群众不要根据估计猜测提意见，要根据具体事实提意见，群众见到的提出来是对的，就是要弄清问题，不是找错，拿“把柄”把他证住，群众中也涌现出来了这种意见，认为只估圪堆不行，但对靳锁则的怀疑还是存在的。“六斤银器那里去了？还贪污了多少？”靳锁则自己也感到很着急，只是说：“俺不识字，这里一圪堆那里一圪堆，群众一问咱就说不上来！”苦闷无办法。至此，清算帐目与接收告一段落，算帐很难继续下去，整党工作即转入更有效的方面。
    至本月初，经过群众讨论，党员都被欢迎回到群众各种组织里去了。在丈地和评议产量的工作中，党员的工作表现一般还好，抗勤主任靳国全，以前大家对他有很多意见，但是自从参加丈地评产量工作以后，群众对他的工作能力和经验看重了。在评议产量的会议上，遇到不好解决的问题时，大家总是说：“靳国全你说说吧！”在这个会上，后来又选他当了主席。在农会接收树木的时候，新农会又委他去负责接收树木，他说：“这两天在工作里可痛快哩！”靳锁则也说：“整党时间，群众见了咱连话也不说，丈量地时就团结的好。”群众对党员的反映则说：“党员这两天工作不赖。”“那些人（党员）还是有些经验。”
    丈地完后，于三月二十六日又恢复整党，准备结束整党工作。由于群众和党员思想上都有进步，在党群关系上理智多了：一、不再作个人历史的总清算，把历史上的错误与工作中的错误缺点区别开了。二、偏激情绪已经消减，把为公和为私分开了，讲道理查思想，而群众中的相互批评的现象较前加强了，对党员提出处分更加理智和慎重。在第一次群众拟定党员处分，提出应该开除党籍的靳才垣、靳同元，还认为开除党籍后，应交人民法庭处三、五年不等的徒刑；这次通过对靳才垣的问题时，把他第一次开除党籍与重新入党后的过错区别开了，主张给以当众警告处分。把靳同元未入党前的罪过（当土匪杀过人）与入党后的进步分开了：“要说他入党以后吧，就没有什么，只是态度不好，给他个当面警告吧！”对公安员李文科在以前一提起来群众就说：“这人可是恶的很，吊人、打人是常事，乱戴特务帽子，至少要开除党籍。”这次反省好，承认错误彻底，而又看到他犯错误不少是因公，不全怨他，但因为他好报复，群众说：“给他个警告处分。”旧农会委员李聚堂上次也是主张开除党籍的，说他是靳才垣的“家将”，态度太赖，老流氓；这次一平心静气研究，流氓是未入党前的事，入党后改了，态度不好是真的，但因此就给他过高的处分，觉着不合适。三街房马成说：“只态度不好不该处分”，全体通过了他的意见。只有靳锁则的问题，因几斤银器没弄清楚，群众意见很多，还未最后解决。群众对党员在丈地评产量工作中的转变与进步看得很清楚，对党员处分的决定关系很大。当通过靳才垣时，群众说：“人家丈地负责细致，量多量少，都要经过三四遍才确定，就是进步了。”对靳同元则说：“丈地时他打算盘，经常督促不休息，多干活，很负责任。”
    在划阶级与评议抽补中，党员对多占土地、房屋与财物，该退则退，该赔就赔，十分认真，共退出土地六十余亩。靳才垣要献房，并要退出自买地八亩，计算产量退出就不够平均数，群众要给他另补三亩；靳洪章要退近地四亩，群众说你夫妻俩要按三口人算，可以退三亩远地；赵挪山（抗属，党员）自动退出楼房十间；区干赵文斌要退新房，因旧房坏了，群众要给他补木材叫他修理。这样很融洽地解决了党员多占果实问题。党群关系因此而更加改进，党员与群众的情感已逐步融洽。现正结合实行抽补，进行整党总结，检查过去支部的工作，讨论如何在群众中进行建党工作。
