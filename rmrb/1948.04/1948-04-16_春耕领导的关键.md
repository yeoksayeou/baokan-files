　　Spring Plowing Leadership Key
    Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Masses Daily Short Commentary

    As early as the beginning of February, the Northwest Bureau and the Border Region Government issued instructions on launching the spring plowing campaign, as well as decisions on disaster relief, and notified all localities to suspend land reform half a month before spring plowing and shift to spring plowing. Recently, various sub-regions have also issued instructions, proposing tasks and guidelines, and clearly pointing out that spring plowing is the center of all current work; it is necessary to mobilize the masses in a timely manner for mutual assistance and adjustment to solve difficulties such as plowing animals, food grain, and seeds; it is necessary to publicize the victorious situation of our army, explain the land reform policy, and eliminate the masses' doubts and concerns about developing production; it is necessary to organize and carry out production competitions; production must be combined with disaster relief; border areas must combine labor and military affairs and arm themselves to protect spring plowing, etc. Some counties and districts have also held cadre meetings or issued special instructions, which are all very necessary. The question now is how to fully implement these correct guidelines and instructions among the masses in practical work. However, recent facts prove that attention in this area is very poor. For example, the instructor and township head of Yihe Seventh Township held a meeting at the district level on March 13th, and convened a meeting of village cadres on the 17th, talking about planting more early grain and spring vegetables, developing women's spinning, and promoting voluntary combination to organize mutual aid teams, etc., and assigned village cadres to go back to investigate the number of military dependents' families without or lacking labor in order to coordinate collective cultivation throughout the township. After the village cadres returned, they actually only did one thing: investigating the military dependents' families that needed collective cultivation. The instructor did not even know how much early grain was planted in Huangjiachuan, where the township government was located, and had to admit that "we only did meetings and promotion for production." Therefore, in this township, except for a few villages where the work team comrades directly led spring plowing and did a better job, there were still several villages where, due to the lack of strong leadership, many difficulties were not resolved in a timely manner, and production was progressing poorly. Similar phenomena probably exist in many places, so it should arouse serious attention from the leadership, because any correct policy, instruction, and decision, if not implemented among the masses through good working methods and transformed into the actions of the masses, will still be empty words on paper.
    We should not simply blame rural cadres for this phenomenon of empty talk in the spring plowing movement, nor should we look at the problem in isolation. The reasons for the formation of this phenomenon in various places are roughly as follows: First, during the war, necessary rear-area stretcher transportation mobilizations are still numerous. For example, in the villages along the main road in Yihe Yanjiaquan, stretcher bearers and mules are requisitioned for errands every day. Second, in many places, after land reform, new and old cadres have not been well united, and the leadership core of the rural party and government has not been formed. Third, there is still bureaucracy and a lack of concrete leadership styles. Some rural cadres and work team comrades do not pay enough attention to leading spring plowing and lack effective methods; higher-level leading organs also lack specific guidance on working methods, and in-depth inspection of work is rare. The main reason among all these reasons is that the bureaucratic style still exists and the concrete leadership style is still lacking, and the responsibility mainly lies with the higher-ups rather than the rural cadres.
    Therefore, the key to strengthening the leadership of spring plowing lies in improving the working methods of leading organs above the district level, and it is necessary to change the bureaucratic style and conscientiously implement the leadership method of combining general appeals with individual guidance. Party and government organs at all levels in districts, counties, sub-regions, and border regions must immediately send out a number of staff members to lead the spring plowing movement in one or several places (townships or villages) nearby, conscientiously do a good job, gain experience, set an example, and promote others. Furthermore, regularly conduct focused in-depth inspections of the spring plowing work in several villages and townships, discover good examples, and promptly summarize their experiences and introduce them to various places for learning; if shortcomings are found, especially deviations of a general nature, promptly remind various places to pay attention to correcting them. Without this in-depth mass-based and meticulous organizational work, it is impossible to achieve the arduous task of launching a large-scale production campaign this year. Once leading organs at all levels implement this correct working method, they will inevitably be able to quickly strengthen their ties with the masses, effectively and forcefully promote the current spring plowing movement, test and enrich the various policies they issue, and continuously enrich the experience of leadership work.

### 春耕领导的关键

　　春耕领导的关键
    陕甘宁群众日报短评
    早在二月初，西北局和边府就发下了开展春耕运动的指示，及关于救灾的决定，并通知各地于春耕前半个月停止土改，转入春耕。最近各分区也发了指示，提出了任务和方针，且明白的指出春耕是当前一切工作的中心；要及时发动群众互助调剂，解决耕畜、吃粮、籽种等困难；要宣传我军胜利形势，解释土改政策，消除群众对发展生产的怀疑和顾虑；要组织起来，进行生产竞赛；生产必须与救灾结合起来；边沿区要劳武结合，武装保卫春耕等。有些县、区还开了干部会，或专门发了指示，这些都是很必要的，现在的问题是如何在实际工作中把这些正确的方针和指示完全贯彻到群众中去。但就近的事实证明恰好在这方面的注意是很差的，如义合七乡指导员和乡长，三月十三日在区上开了会，十七日召集各村干部开了会，讲了多种早粮春菜，发展妇纺，提倡自愿结合组织变工等，并分配各村干部回去调查没有或缺少劳力的军工属家数，以便全乡统筹代耕。各村干部回去，实际只做了调查需要代耕的军工属家户一件事。指导员连乡政府住的黄家川共种了多少早粮也不知道，而不得不承认“对于生产，我们只做了开会提倡。”因此，这个乡里，除少数村庄，工作团同志直接领导春耕做得较好外，还有好几个村庄，因缺乏有力的领导，许多困难没有得到及时解决，生产进行得很差。类似这种现象，恐怕很多地方都存在着，所以应当引起领导上的严重注意，因为任何正确的政策、指示和决定，如果没有很好的工作方法，贯彻到群众中去，变为群众的行动，则仍然是纸上的空文。
    这种春耕运动中的空谈现象，我们不应该单纯的去责备乡村干部，不能孤立的看问题。各地形成这种现象的原因，大体有如下几种：一、战争时期，后方必要的担架运输动员仍然不少，如义合延家川沿大路各乡，每天都有转运担架和毛驴支差；二、许多地方土改后，新旧干部未能很好团结起来，乡村党政的领导核心没有形成；三、仍然有官僚主义缺乏具体领导作风。若干乡村干部及工作团同志对领导春耕重视不够，办法不多；上级领导机关对工作方法上的具体指导也不够，深入检查工作很少，所有这些原因中的主要原因是官僚主义作风仍然存在，具体领导作风仍然缺乏，其责任又主要在上边而不在乡村干部。
    因此，加强春耕领导的关键，在于改进区以上各级领导机关的工作方法，必须改变官僚主义的作风，认真实行一般号召与个别指导相结合的领导方法。各区、县、分区和边区的各级党政机关，必须立即派出若干工作人员，就近领导一处或几处（乡或村）的春耕运动，切实做好，取得经验，做出榜样，推动其他。又经常有重点的深入检查若干村、乡的春耕工作，发现好的范例，应及时总结其经验，介绍各地学习；发现缺点特别是带一般性质的偏向，则及时提醒各地注意纠正。没有这种深入群众的、细致的组织工作，要实现今年开展大生产运动的艰巨任务，是不可能的。而各级领导机关一经实行这种正确的工作方法之后，就必然的能够很快地密切和群众的联系，切实有力的推动当前的春耕运动，考验和充实自己发出的各项政策，使领导工作的经验不断丰富起来。
