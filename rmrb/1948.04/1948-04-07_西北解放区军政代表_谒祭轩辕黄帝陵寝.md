The sacrificial ceremony was extremely grand.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th. The text of the Northwest Liberated Area military and political representatives' sacrifice to the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum is as follows:

On the Qingming Festival, the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China, Liu Jingfan, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, Zhao Shoushan, Deputy Commander of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department, etc., representing compatriots from all walks of life in the Border Region and all officers and soldiers of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, respectfully offer incense, flowers, wine, and ritual offerings before the Mausoleum of our Yellow Emperor, saying: Oh, great Yellow Emperor, you are the ancestor of our nation, you are the forefather of our laborers, the creator of history. From your era onwards, our great Chinese nation has labored, lived, and multiplied in this vast territory, and has continuously defeated darkness and striven for light through its labor, unity, and efforts. On the land of our motherland, we have opened up magnificent rivers and mountains and created a glorious history. The heroic struggles of past dynasties against autocracy and tyranny, and the national democratic movement against imperialism and feudalism in the last hundred years, fully demonstrate the great spirit of our Chinese nation. Since the birth of the vanguard of the Chinese working people - the Communist Party of China - in the tenth year of the Republic of China, the future of our nation has shone even brighter. Over the past twenty years, the masses of our people have achieved unprecedentedly great accomplishments in the great revolutionary war for national independence and people's democracy. After the barbaric Japanese fascists were defeated, the greatest task of our people is to build a new China that is independent, peaceful, democratic, unified, and prosperous. Unfortunately, the reactionaries in our country, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, in order to maintain their disastrous rule, do not hesitate to act as running dogs of American imperialism, sign various treaties that cede rights and humiliate the country, and sell our country's sovereignty to the United States. They launched a civil war, massacred the people, and the vast land of China is covered in blood. Excellent sons and daughters are subjected to humiliation. The towering crimes of the people's enemy, Chiang Kai-shek, in stealing the country and selling it out, are even worse than those of the traitors Yuan Shikai and Wang Jingwei. The working people of our Chinese nation have united like steel under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, and continue to fight heroically for the cause of our motherland's independence and the liberation of the people. Now we can tell you with comfort that the new democratic society that our people have strived to achieve has been established on the vast land of our motherland, which has 160 million people. The strength of the people is unprecedentedly strong. In the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, the People's Liberation Army has reversed the counter-revolutionary wheels of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the land of our motherland, leading them to the road of destruction, and has promoted its own revolutionary wheels, leading them to the road of victory. The continued victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army this spring shows that the liberation of the entire country is not far away. It is especially gratifying that the people of our Northwest have victoriously recovered Huangling County (Zhongbu County), the site of the mausoleum of our nation's ancestor. This is an auspicious sign of the liberation of the entire nation and an auspicious omen for the birth of a new China. No matter how hard American imperialism tries to support it, no matter how desperately the counter-revolutionary bandit gang struggles, our 450 million outstanding descendants of the Yellow Emperor will surely unite as one, under the strong leadership of their vanguard - the Communist Party of China, and carry the revolutionary war to the end, resolutely, cleanly, thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by American imperialism, and realize national victory as soon as possible! Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation! May the Yellow Emperor of Xuanyuan live forever! Accept our offering.

    【新华社西北五日电】西北解放区军政代表祭黄陵文如下：
    中华民国三十七年清明节日，陕甘宁边区政府副主席刘景范、西北人民解放军副司令员赵寿山、政治部主任甘泗淇等，谨代表边区各界同胞及西北人民解放军全体将士以香花酒醴之仪，致祭于我轩辕黄帝之陵前曰：伟大的轩辕黄帝，你是我民族的始祖，你是我劳动者的先人，历史的创造者，从你那一时代起，我们伟大的中华民族即劳动生息繁衍于这幅员广大的领域，并以自己的劳动团结和努力不断战胜黑暗，争取光明；在我们祖国的土地上开辟了锦绣河山，创造了光辉的历史。历代反专制反暴君的英勇斗争，近百年来反帝反封建的民族民主运动，充分表现了我中华民族的伟大精神。迄民国十年中国劳动人民的先锋队——中国共产党出世后，我民族前途更大放光明。二十余年来我国人民大众，在为祖国独立为人民民主的伟大革命战争中，已获得了空前巨大的成就。在野蛮的日本法西斯被打倒以后，我国人民最大的任务，是要建立一个独立和平民主统一和富强的新中国。不幸以蒋介石为首的我国反动派，为要维持其祸国殃民的统治，不惜充当美国帝国主义走狗，签订丧权辱国的种种条约，将我国主权出卖给美国。发动内战，残杀人民，莽莽神洲，遍地腥膻，优秀儿女，任人凌辱。人民公敌蒋介石此种窃国卖国的滔天罪行，较卖国贼袁世凯、汪精卫之流，实有过之无不及。我中华民族劳动人民已在伟大中国共产党领导下钢铁般的团结起来，为我祖国独立人民解放事业继续英勇奋斗。现在可以告慰于你的，我国人民奋力以求的新民主主义社会，已在拥有一万万六千万人民的广大祖国土地上建立起来了，人民的力量是空前的强大了。民国三十六年人民解放军，已在我祖国的土地上，扭转了美帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮的反革命车轮，使之走向覆灭的道路，推进了自己的革命车轮，使之走向胜利的道路。本年春季人民解放军继续胜利的进攻，显示着全国人民的解放已为期不远，尤其值得庆幸的，就是我西北人民，现已胜利的光复了我民族始祖陵寝所在地——黄陵县（中部县），这是全民族解放的祥兆，新中国诞生的瑞征。不管美帝国主义如何竭力支援，不管反革命匪帮如何拼命挣扎，我四万万五千万优秀的黄帝子孙，定能团结一致的在其先锋队——中国共产党的坚强领导下，把革命战争进行到底，坚决干净彻底全部消灭美帝国主义支持下的蒋介石匪帮，早日实现全国胜利！中华民族解放万岁！轩辕黄帝万古千秋！尚飨。
