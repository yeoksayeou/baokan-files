The newly liberated soldier Pan Shicheng brought back four prisoners and immediately said to them: "Don't be afraid, I was also liberated from Suixian, we don't beat or scold, we treat you well." Before the gunfire had stopped, 108 prisoners were sitting neatly on the hillside listening to the Liberation Army personnel explain the policy on prisoners. Zhang Suoren, the company commander of the 9th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the brigade, was speechless with emotion when he saw that his ring, watch, and pen were all preserved. The Liberation Army helped many Chiang army soldiers find most of their personal belongings that they had lost on the battlefield. The Liberation Army promptly treated the wounded soldiers abandoned by the Chiang bandits. Zhang Guyan, the company commander of the 3rd Company of the 3rd Battalion of the brigade, was wounded in the leg, and Chen Jiabang, the special affairs chief of the 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion, was injured falling off a wall, and both received treatment.
