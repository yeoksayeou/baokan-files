Italian Communists Fighting for New Democracy Against the Italian People
Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party

The current task of the Italian Communist Party is to broadly unite all classes threatened by imperialist policies and establish a people's democratic front to defend peace. Obviously, under the current circumstances, the progressive forces in most European countries, the new democracies, and countries like France and Italy, which have become the latest targets of American imperialism, especially the parties organizing these forces, feel the need to establish mutual connections among themselves in order to unify the forces fighting for national independence and European peace. This is what the meeting of representatives of the nine communist parties discussed.

In any case, it is necessary to prevent the government from turning Italy into a pawn of imperialism, even if only initially. There is a very close relationship between the threat to peace in Italy and the threat to Italian independence. Italy's independence is closely linked to so-called American aid and the "Marshall Plan." We do not deny that Italy needs assistance from the country that is currently economically the most powerful in the world. At the same time, we must remind the American representatives that when they talk about their aid, they say they have a special responsibility to European countries. The losses suffered by the United States in the war cannot be compared with the losses suffered by the Soviet Union, or even by Italy and France, or Central and Eastern European countries such as Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. We believe we have the right to discuss the conditions of aid. An analysis of the conditions of American "aid" under the "Marshall Plan" makes this clear. The so-called "aid" is interference in Italy's internal affairs, which took shape before the "Marshall Plan." The "Truman Doctrine," aimed at establishing American imperialist world hegemony, already contained the danger of war. I don't think any Italian who cares about Italy's future destiny and independence can agree to this kind of interference.

The aim of our national policy today should be to prevent the establishment of new reactionary state blocs in Europe, especially reactionary Catholic state blocs established under the wings of American imperialism. If such a bloc is established, it would mean the end of our autonomy and independence, and the unification of Italy would become a problem. What we need is to exchange goods with European countries, especially Eastern European countries, whose economies can complement Italy's economy. Unfortunately, we are not doing this today, and the reason is that the United States has already begun to exert its political and economic influence. Obviously, the exchange of goods between Italy and Eastern European countries is disliked by those who believe it is necessary to mobilize all the forces of Western Europe to fight against these countries. Of course, this kind of exchange of goods is also unfavorable to those who are unwilling to restore our metallurgical and machine industries.

The policy of temporary aid and the "Marshall Plan" is a policy aimed at cutting off the road to Italy's economic development. Not only those with progressive and democratic ideas—Socialists and Communists—have begun to understand this, but also those who lead industry and maintain their independent views without colluding with the lackeys of American imperialism have begun to feel it.

It is said that American help does not seem to be conditional on any political agreement. But less than two weeks after the last batch of American occupying forces withdrew, a prominent statement appeared. In that statement, the American government stated that it still retained the unilateral right to defend our independence, and we listened with shame in the National Assembly to the report of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He accepted this statement, which insulted Italy's honor and dignity.

Italy's independence is first and foremost protected by our united and vigilant Italians, who are wary of foreign interference. If further guarantees and defenses are necessary, if we do not want to turn Italy into a semi-colony and colony of foreign imperialist powers, then this protection can only be collective and of an international security nature under any circumstances. Now, not only is Italy's independence threatened, but also the freedom that has been won through extraordinary efforts is threatened. This threat comes particularly from the Vatican, which has recently adopted a stance that cannot but be regarded as extremely reactionary. In the face of the open totalitarian stance taken by the upper echelons of the Catholic Church, we would like to remind Catholics and other believers that in order for Italy to embark on a broad road, to get rid of the system of slavery and capitalist autocracy, and to rebuild our socio-economic life, it is necessary to realize the great unity of democratic forces.

The Italian General Confederation of Labor is being threatened, because the unity of trade unions is a decisive weapon in the hands of the working class and working people. The unity of trade unions, which includes all kinds of working people, incomparably expands the possibility of victory in the struggle between working people and capitalists. Conservative and reactionary forces, under the wings of American imperialism, in the Christian Democratic Party, in the "Catholic Action" association, and among the upper echelons of the Church, have found their organizational center. Thus, the Christian Democratic Party has become a social conservative party, an American party, a party that restricts labor and cancels Italian independence. Therefore, in all kinds of debates and struggles, democrats should concentrate their fire on this party.

I do not see a "third force" on the Italian political stage. The leaders of the Republican Party participated in the government formed according to American instructions. The true leaders of the Saragat Party have exposed themselves to the people of the country as lackeys of American imperialism, as agents of imperialism, and have participated in the government in this capacity. Therefore, it is impossible to say that this group of people is a "third force," and it is impossible to distinguish them from the Christian Democratic Party and the leading elements of the Italian reactionary classes who are protected by and serve American imperialism.

Of course, we are pursuing a line of democratic struggle, but we will not allow anyone—any conspiracy or reactionary plan—to launch a surprise attack on us. We have the experience of patriotic war, and not only us, but also millions of young people and adults, who have learned to use weapons to defend our country's freedom and independence. If this situation arises, so that they must use armed action to defend and fight for freedom, they will complete their task for democracy and for their motherland.

The slogan of establishing "progressive democracy," that is, establishing a new people's democratic system based on reforming the national economic institutions and the participation of the workers, peasants, and the masses of the people in the political leadership of the state, is not a temporary and fleeting slogan. This slogan is part of a strategic plan dictated by the development of all international and domestic situations in the current post-war period. The new democratic road that Italy should take—which can open up the road to socialism for us—is still only in preparation and planning. We now only have some factors, namely, on the one hand, the cooperation between the Socialist and Communist parties and the parliamentary system, and on the other hand, the broadly developed mass movement. We should take this road, and our party should be good at walking in front, and never lose sight of its basic strategic policy. It should understand that this policy is applicable to the entire historical period, and be good at changing its activities and strategies on this basis. This is the political ability that our party should have. Of course, there are obstacles. The greatest danger that has threatened us and continues to threaten us in the last two years is the danger of surrenderism. It is necessary to distinguish between a policy of unity and a policy of surrender, and under no circumstances can we abandon the program and goals of struggle implemented by the party.

The year 1848 was the year of the publication of the "Communist Manifesto," and the greatest thought in the modern world was born from this. This thought, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, which was educated by Lenin and Stalin in the spirit of Marx and Engels, in the spirit of the "Communist Manifesto," has been realized by the great October Socialist Revolution. This great party, for the first time in history, led the working class to seize power, convinced them that they are the leading class of the whole nation, and laid the foundation for a new socialist society. We warmly and sincerely salute this party and its leaders, because they are faithful to the principles of Marxism and have made a decisive contribution to the cause of human historical progress. If the Italian Communist Party wants to move forward, if it wants to continue to develop into a powerful democratic and revolutionary political force, it should also be faithful to these principles. We believe that the Sixth Congress will mark a new stage in the development and consolidation of the Italian Communist Party. The Italian people know that the Communist Party is such a party that will do everything necessary to defend the freedom won, to advance the cause of democracy, to fundamentally change the life of our country, to open up the road to a free and happy future for the Italian people, to the road of establishing a new society of freedom and equality—a socialist society.

    为新民主主义而战斗着的
    意共产党人反意大利人民
    意共总书记  托格里亚蒂
    意大利共产党的当前任务，乃是广泛的团结一切遭受帝国主义政策威胁的阶层，建立保卫和平的人民民主阵线。显然在现在情势之下，大多数欧洲国家，各新民主主义国家及象法、意等成为美帝国主义进攻最近目标的国家中的进步力量，尤其是组织这些力量的党，感到建立他们之间互相联系的必要，以统一为民族独立及欧洲和平而战斗的力量，这就是九国共产党代表会议所商讨的事情。
    无论如何必须阻止政府将意大利变为帝国主义走卒的行动，那怕仅仅是初步，对意大利和平的威胁与对意大利独立的威胁之间有极密切的关系。意大利的独立与所谓美国的援助与“马歇尔计划”有极密切之联系。我们不否认意大利需要得到现今世界上在经济方面最有力的国家的援助，同时我们也须提醒美国代表们，他们在讲到自己的援助时，说他们对欧洲国家有特别的责任。美国在战争中的损失，不能与苏联所遭受的损失，甚至意大利及法国或中欧、东欧各国如波兰、南斯拉夫及捷克斯拉夫所遭受的损失相比拟。我们认为我们有权利讨论援助的条件。试分析一下，根据“马歇尔计划”的美国“援助”的条件即可明白。所谓“援助”即是对意大利内政的干涉，它在“马歇尔计划”之前就已形成，为着建立美国帝国主义世界霸权的“杜鲁门主义”，就已包藏着战争的危险。我想没有任何一个关心意大利将来的命运及其独立的意大利人，能够同意这种干涉。
    我们的民族政策的目的，今天应该是阻止欧洲建立新的反动的国家集团，尤其是在美帝国主义卵翼下建立反动的天主教国家集团。如果这样的集团建立了，这就意味着我国自主及独立的终结，并使意大利的统一成了问题。我们需要的是与欧洲各国尤其是与东欧各国交换货物，他们的经济可以补足意大利的经济。可惜的是我们今天没有这样作，其原因即在于美国已开始施展其政治、经济影响。显然意大利与东欧各国间的货物交换，是那些认为必需动员西欧的一切力量与这些国家进行斗争的人们所不喜欢的。当然此种货物交换对于那些不乐意恢复我们的冶金及机器工业的人们也是不利的。
    临时援助及“马歇尔计划”的政策，其目的就是斩断意大利经济发展道路的政策。这一点，不仅具有进步民主思想的人们——社会党人及共产党人——已经开始了解，且领导工业及不与美帝国主义的走狗同流合污而保有自己独立见解的人们，也开始感觉到了。
    据说美国的帮助似乎不以任何政治协定为交换条件。但是最后一批美国占领军撤退以后还不到两个礼拜，一个著名的声明就出现了。在该声明中，美国政府说明其仍保有保卫我国独立的单方面的权利，而我们也在国民议会中以耻辱的心情来听取外交部长的报告。他接受了这个侮辱意大利荣誉及尊严的声明。
    意大利的独立首先是由我们团结而警惕着外国干涉的意大利人来尽力保护的，如果有进一步保证及保卫它的必要，假使我们不愿意使意大利变为外国帝国主义强国的半殖民地及殖民地，那末这种保护在任何情况下也只能是集体及国际安全性质的保护。现在，不仅意大利的独立受到了威胁，而且经过非常的努力争得的自由也受到了威胁。这个威胁特别是由梵蒂冈而来的。它在最近采取了不能不认为是极端反动的立场。在天主教教庭上层主教采取公开集权主义的立场的情况下，我们愿提醒天主教徒及其他信徒们，如要意大利能走上康庄大道摆脱奴役制度及资本主义专制制度与重建我们社会经济生活，那就必需实现民主力量的大团结。
    意大利全国总工会正遭受着威胁，因为职工会的统一乃是工人阶级及劳动人民手中有决定意义的斗争武器。包括了各种劳动人民的职工会的统一，无可比拟地扩大了劳动人民与资本家斗争中胜利的可能性。保守的及反动的力量在美国帝国主义的卵翼下，在基督教民主党中，在“天主教行动”协会中，在教庭的上层的主教中，找到了自己组织的中心。这样基督教民主党变成了社会保守党，变成了美国党，变成了劳动限制及取消意大利独立的党，因之在各种论战与斗争中，民主分子都应该集中火力反对这个党。
    在意大利的政治舞台上我看不到“第三种力量”。共和党的领导者参加了根据美国人的指令组成的政府。萨拉盖特党的真正领导者们在全国人的面前已暴露出他们是美国帝国主义的走狗，是帝国主义的代理人，并以此资格参加了政府，因之不可能说这帮人是“第三种力量”，不可能把他们与基督教民主党及在美帝国主义的保护下并为其服务的意大利反动阶层的领导分子区别开来。
    固然我们执行民主斗争的路线，但绝不容许任何人——任何阴谋及反动计划对我们进行突然袭击。我们有爱国战争的经验，并且不仅是我们，而且还有千百万的青年人及成年人，他们已学会了使用保卫我们国家自由及独立的武器。如果这种情势到来，致使他们必需用武装行动的方法以保卫并争取自由的话，他们是会为民主为自己祖国而完成自己的任务的。
    建立“进步的民主”的口号，亦即建立基于改革国家经济机构及工农大众与全体人民参加国家政治领导的新的人民民主制度的口号，并不是临时的转瞬即逝的口号，这个口号是现在战后这一时期一切国际形势发展及国内形势发展所规定的战略计划的一部分。意大利所应走的新民主主义道路——它可为我们开辟走向社会主义的大道——还仅仅是在准备与计划中。我们现在仅只具有了若干因素，此即一方面有社共两党之合作，有议会制度，而另一方面有广泛发展的群众运动。我们应该走这一条道路，我们党应该善于走在前面，任何时候都不要迷失自己的基本战略方针。应懂得这个方针是适用于整个历史时期的，要善于在这个基础上改变自己的活动及策略，这就是我党应具的政治能力。当然还有障碍，在最近两年威胁着我们并仍在威胁我们的最大的危险，就是投降主义的危险。必需区别开团结政策及投降政策，并在任何情形之下都不能够放弃党所实行的斗争纲领及目标。
    一八四八年是“共产党宣言”出世的一年，而现代世界上最伟大的思想即由此产生，这个思想在列宁、斯大林根据马克斯及恩格斯的精神，根据“共产党宣言”的精神所教育的布尔什维克党的领导之下，已由伟大的十月社会主义革命实现了。这个伟大党在的历史上第一次引导工人阶级取得了政权，使他们确信自己是全民族的领导阶级，奠定了新的社会主义社会的基础，我们热烈的虔诚的向这个党及其领导者致敬，因为他们忠实于马克思主义的原则，给人类历史的进步的事业以决定的贡献。意大利共产党如果他愿意前进，如果他愿意继续发展为强大的民主的革命的政治力量，他也应该忠实于这些原则。我们认为六次代表大会将标志着意大利共产党发展及巩固的新阶段。意大利人民知道共产党是这样的党，他将为保卫赢得的自由，为将民主的事业推向前进，根本改变我国的生活，为给意大利人民开辟走向自由幸福的将来的道路，走向建立自由平等的新社会——社会主义社会的道路而作必要作的一切。（续完）
