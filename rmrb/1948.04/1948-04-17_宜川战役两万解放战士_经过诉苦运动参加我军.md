Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 15th: The over 20,000 liberated soldiers who laid down their arms in the Yichuan Campaign have joined various units of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, becoming a new force for eliminating the Chiang-Hu bandit troops. One unit's education of the newly liberated soldiers, due to its grasp of the spirit of the new-style military consolidation movement, started with speaking bitterness and raising class consciousness. Within a short period, it gave the newly liberated soldiers a preliminary understanding of the Liberation Army and gained some experience from it. First, the unit understood that the newly liberated soldiers were not accustomed to attending meetings, so it adopted informal individual talks and small-group talks to familiarize, educate, and enlighten them. The Sixth Company mobilized all party members and veteran soldiers to conduct extensive heart-to-heart talks, starting from their families and personal experiences to encourage the newly liberated soldiers to speak bitterness. The company's cadres and Party branch frequently understood the situation and guided veteran soldiers in their work methods, so that individual education could be deepened step by step. Therefore, within a short period of time, most of the liberated soldiers had a preliminary understanding that the poor were oppressed and exploited, and realized the suffering they had endured. Subsequently, a meeting was held for all the newly liberated soldiers of the company to pour out their grievances and launch a movement to speak bitterness. In the individual education and small-group chats of the Second Company, it was discovered that most of the newly liberated soldiers were captured by the Baojia chiefs. Therefore, speaking bitterness was started from the issue of conscription and their hatred for the Baojia chiefs. In the course of speaking bitterness, the soldiers were enlightened to realize why their families did not have enough to eat, and why they gave the grain they worked so hard to grow to the landlords, guiding everyone to further discuss the exploitative relationship. Finally, everyone realized that the Baojia chiefs' conscription and grain requisition were serving the landlord class and the Chiang-Hu bandit gang, raising everyone's hatred for the Baojia chiefs to hatred for the Chiang-Hu ruling class. In addition to speaking bitterness, the liberated soldiers who newly joined the army were very surprised and moved to see the care and love of the Liberation Army cadres for the soldiers, the people supporting the army, and the army cherishing the people. The leaders of various units used these facts to conduct comparative education with the Chiang army, in order to strengthen the determination of the newly liberated soldiers to fight for the people.

　　宜川战役两万解放战士
    经过诉苦运动参加我军
    【新华社西北十五日电】宜川战役中放下武器的两万余解放战士，已分别参加西北人民解放军各部，成为消灭蒋胡匪军的新力量。某部对新解放战士的教育由于掌握了新式整军运动的精神，从诉苦及提高阶级觉悟入手，在短期内使新解放战士对解放军具有初步的认识，并从中取得若干经验。首先该部了解新解放战士没有开会的习惯，就采取了不拘形式的个别谈话和小组谈话方式，去熟悉、教育与启发他们。六连发动全体党员及老战士展开广泛的谈心，从家庭和自身的遭遇，启发新解放战士诉苦。连队的干部和党的支部经常了解情况，指导老战士进行工作的方法，使个别教育步步深入。因此短时间内，大部分解放战士都初步的了解穷人是受压迫受剥削的，并认识到自己所受的痛苦。随后召开全连新解放战士吐苦水，展开诉苦运动。二连在个别教育与小组漫谈中，发现大部分新解放战士是被保甲长抓来的。因此从抓丁问题及他们对保甲长的仇恨上展开了诉苦。诉苦中又启发战士认识自己家里为啥不够吃，为啥把辛苦种的粮食送给地主，引导大家进而讨论剥削关系。最后又使大家认识了保甲长抓丁派粮就是为地主阶级和蒋胡匪服务的，使大家对保甲长的仇恨提高到对蒋胡匪统治阶级的仇恨。除了诉苦外，新参加部队的解放战士，看到解放军干部对士兵的关心与爱护，人民拥护军队，军队爱护人民，都使他们非常惊奇感动。各部领导上即以这些事实，进行与蒋军对比教育，以坚定新解放战士为人民而战的决心。
