Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, April 20th: Comprehensive news from various sources: Since the Southern Route Liberation Army launched an offensive sweeping hundreds of miles along the Longhai and Pinghan Railways, directly threatening Zhengzhou, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' central command for the civil war in the Central Plains, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the city are panic-stricken. The Zhengzhou command post of the bandits and other high-ranking officials remaining in Zhengzhou hurriedly sent their families to Kaifeng, while some bandit officials' wives crowded onto planes and fled to Nanjing. The bandit-puppet forces on the outskirts of Zhengzhou, even the puppet Shuikang Township Office in the west of the city, only fifteen miles away from the city, have also retreated into Zhengzhou. The bandits are now forcing civilians to cut down trees day and night to repair fortifications. It is reported that the fortifications in Zhengzhou had previously used 5.6 billion Chiang Kai-shek dollars, and now they continue to force citizens and shops to "donate money." The houses of merchants on various streets have been demolished. The Zhengzhou Chiang Kai-shek bandits declared martial law on the 8th of this month, and then declared "urgent martial law" on the 11th, prohibiting residents from passing through after noon every day. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits took the opportunity of martial law to rob. At 10:00 p.m. on the 7th, Kang Wangfeng, Han Changzhi, and Jia Yongtai, citizens at No. 11 Taipingli, were robbed of their watches, gold rings, and 1.76 million Chiang Kai-shek dollars by three Chiang Kai-shek soldiers with pistols. The city originally had more than a dozen secondary schools, including the Provincial Fifth Middle School, Zheng Gong Middle School, and Mingxin Middle School, which have now been disbanded by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. A large number of students and citizens are fleeing to the countryside and the areas controlled by the Liberation Army. They said, "The Eighth Route Army has captured Luoyang and will capture Zhengzhou sooner or later. Instead of suffering the foreign sins of the Central Government (Chiang Kai-shek bandits) in the city, it is better to wait until the Eighth Route Army occupies the city and then go home." When the citizens passed on the good news of the Liberation Army's advance, their faces were filled with joy.

Another dispatch: The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Kaifeng have ordered the demolition of houses near the city walls. Xinyang has also demolished a large number of houses in the suburbs. More than 2,000 houses within 100 meters outside the city have been destroyed, leaving four to five thousand poor residents homeless.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 21st: The Chiang Kai-shek gang has recently implemented a "police service area system" in some areas and established so-called "special criminal courts" in an attempt to suppress the just resistance of the people in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas. The Jiangsu bandit authorities are using more than 400 special police officers who graduated on February 26th to "pilot" the so-called "police service area system" in ten counties including Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Xishan, Zhenjiang, and Danyang. Its content is exactly the same as the "police officer control system" previously piloted in Chongqing, Shanghai and other places, which was strongly opposed by the people. In the future, in the above-mentioned ten counties, Chiang Kai-shek bandits police officers can visit any family at any time. All actions of the people will be subject to comprehensive monitoring. The Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandits implemented fascist control as early as after the "February 28th" civil unrest last year. In August and September, they divided the people into three classes: Class A were "law-abiding" people, Class B were "non-law-abiding" people, and Class C were "most non-law-abiding" people. People who were "most non-law-abiding" were interrogated once a day, Class B people were interrogated once every half a month, and even so-called "law-abiding" people were interrogated once every two months. Shanghai, Wuhan and other places have successively established bloody institutions to suppress the people, the "Special Criminal Court," in March of this year. Anyone whom the Chiang Kai-shek bandits deem to be against the treasonous, dictatorial and civil war decrees will be arrested and "tried" by this institution, and it is stipulated that no appeals can be made after the first trial verdict.

　　郑州开封蒋匪恐慌强迫市民赶修工事
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十日电】综合各方消息：自南线解放军发动攻势席卷陇海、平汉两铁路数百里，直逼蒋匪中原内战指挥中心郑州近郊后，该城蒋匪慌张失措。匪郑州指挥所及其他留郑高级官员，慌忙把家眷送至开封，部分匪官太太则挤上飞机逃往南京。郑州外围匪伪，连距城仅十五里之城西伪水康乡公所亦都缩进郑州，匪现正日夜强拉民夫砍伐树木，加修工事。据悉，郑州工事前已用掉蒋币五十六亿元，近又继续强迫市民及商店“捐款”。各街口商户房屋横遭拆毁。郑州蒋匪自本月八日即宣布戒严，十一日又宣布“急紧戒严”，每日正午以后即禁止居民通行。蒋匪则借戒严抢劫，七日夜十时，太平里十一号，市民康王峰、韩昌直、贾永泰即被蒋军三名持手枪抢去手表、金戒子及蒋币一百七十六万元。该城原有省立第五中学、正公中学、明新中学等十几个中等学校，现均被蒋匪解散。大批学生市民刻正向四乡及解放军控制区逃生。他们说：“八路军打下了洛阳，迟早要打下郑州，与其在城里受中央（蒋匪）洋罪，不如待八路占城后再回家。”市民在互传解放军进军捷报时，均面有喜色。
    另讯：开封蒋匪已勒令将城墙附近民房拆除。信阳亦大肆拆毁城郊民房，城外一百公尺内，二千余间民房，全被毁去，四五千穷苦居民顿告流离失所。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】蒋匪帮近在若干地区实行“警勤区制”，并设立所谓“特种刑事法庭”妄图以镇压蒋区人民正义反抗。江苏匪当局正以于二月二十六日毕业的四百余名特务警察在苏州、无锡、常州、＠山、镇江、丹阳等十县“试行”所谓“警勤区制”，其内容与过去在渝沪各地试行，遭人民强烈反对之“警员警管制”完全一样。今后在上述十县中，蒋匪警员可于任何时间，访问任何一家。人民一切行动将遭受全面监视。台湾蒋匪则早于去年“二二八”民变后即实施法西斯管制，八九月间更将人民划为三等，甲种为“守法”者、乙种为“不守法”者、丙种为“最不守法”者。“最不守法”的人每天要被查问一次，乙种半月查一次，连所谓“守法”的也要两月查一次。沪汉等地已于本年三月相继成立镇压人民的血腥机构“特种刑事法庭”。凡蒋匪认为反对卖国独裁内战法令的人均予逮捕由该机构“审判”，且规定一审判决后不得上诉。
