Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th: The Zhoucun City Electrical Company and Dayou Flour Company, the largest private industrial enterprises in the city, officially resumed operations on the 27th of last month. The Electrical Company was founded in 1921 by Zhang Xinmin from Zhangqiu and others, with capital expanding to 300,000 yuan by 1936. After the Japanese surrender, the company suffered significant losses due to two invasions by the Chiang bandit gang. After February of last year, the company was able to resume operations with the assistance of a 3 million Northern Currency loan from the democratic government; however, it was again destroyed by the Chiang bandits last autumn. After this recovery, the democratic government immediately provided two months' wages and subsidized the workers' families. The workers are extremely enthusiastic about their work. The water pool inside the Electrical Company's factory was damaged by artillery fire, and worker Chen Baohe repaired it naked in the cold water for a full day and night. By March 27th, power generation had begun, and the entire city was brightly lit. The Flour Company's machines also started operating simultaneously after workers repaired them using old belts. Within five hours, they milled over 13,000 catties of flour. Furthermore, in Yong'an Town, the city had 118 large and small businesses closed down during the seven months of Chiang bandit rule, and most industries were closed or suspended. Within half a month of our recovery, 107 businesses have resumed operations, and all ironworks have started work. Merchants from Laiwu, Huimin, Leling, and other places are coming to purchase goods, and the local specialty industry is flourishing.

    百多家工商业已开门营业
    【新华社华东二十日电】周村市最大民营工业电气公司及大有面粉公司，上月二十七日已正式复业。电气公司系章邱张新民等一九二一年兴办，至三六年时资金扩大到三十万元。日寇投降后，经蒋匪两度侵占，该公司遭受巨大损失。去年二月以后，经民主政府贷款北币三百万元扶助，始得复业；但去秋又遭蒋匪破坏。此次收复后，民主政府立即贷垫工资两个月，救济工人家属。工人们工作热情极高，电气公司厂内水池被炮火震漏，工人陈保河赤身在冷水中修补一昼夜，至三月二十七日即开始发电，全市大放光明。面粉公司机器亦于工人利用旧皮带加以修补后同时开工，五小时内即磨面一万三千余斤。又：该市永安镇在蒋匪统治的七个月内，大小商号倒闭一一八家，各业大多数倒闭或停业。在我收复半个月内，已有一○七家恢复营业，生铁厂全部开工、现莱芜、惠民、乐陵等地商民纷纷前来购货，土产业日趋繁荣。
