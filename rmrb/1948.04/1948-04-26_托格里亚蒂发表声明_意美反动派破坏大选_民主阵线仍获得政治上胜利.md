Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th: Rome dispatch: Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti published a statement in Unità on the 22nd, stating: This election was not free. Due to the combined interference of foreign imperialism, the political activities of the Church, and the shameless means of the Gasperi government, such as fraud, intimidation, coercion, and deception, its barbarity is unmatched in any modern country. It restricted the political freedom of voters and undermined the free will of voters. Togliatti emphasized: "We must make the truth of this election, which violates Italian freedom and the will of the people, known to the Italian people and the world, and make them understand the enormous value and significance of the fact that eight million Italian citizens elected the People's Democratic Front under the above circumstances for the cause of Italian democracy."
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th: Rome dispatch: The Italian general election on the 18th has concluded, and the People's Democratic Front has achieved a political victory. This Italian election was conducted on an extremely undemocratic basis, with direct interference from American imperialism and the Vatican, which exhausted all shameless tricks such as intimidation, bribery, and religious superstition; internally, there was collusion among reactionaries and despicable acts of blatant fraud, but even according to the figures released by the Italian reactionary government, the People's Democratic Front still won the firm support of more than 31 percent of the people nationwide. In the election for the Chamber of Deputies, the People's Democratic Front received 7,995,000 votes, and in the election for the Senate, it received 6,955,000 votes. The Italian Communist Party's Unità commented on this election: "The People's Democratic Front has gained strong political support throughout Italy. The reactionary plan to isolate the People's Democratic Front from the broad masses of the people has failed." The election results show that the votes obtained by the Republican Party, the Saragat Party, the fascist group "National Alliance," and the fascist party "Italian Social Movement" were negligible, while the monarchists suffered a disastrous defeat. The reactionary groups cast almost all their votes for the Christian Democratic Party. According to the figures published by the Italian reactionary government, the party received 10,740,000 votes in the Senate and 12,681,000 votes in the Chamber of Deputies.

    意美反动派破坏大选
    民主阵线仍获得政治上胜利
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】罗马讯：意共领袖托格里亚蒂二十二日在团结报发表声明称：这次选举是不自由的。由于外国帝国主义的联合干涉，教会的政治活动以及加斯贝利政府的舞弊、恫吓、强迫、欺诈等等无耻手段，其蛮横情形是任何一个近代国家所找不到的。它限制了选民的政治自由，破坏了选民的自由意志。托氏强调：“我们必须将这一侵犯意大利自由及人民意志的选举真相，公诸于意大利人民及全世界的面前，并使他们了解八百万意大利公民在上述情况下选举人民民主阵线一事，对意大利民主事业是具有如何巨大的价值和意义。”
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】罗马讯：意大利十八日大选业已揭晓，人民民主阵线获得了政治上的胜利。意大利这次大选是在极不民主的基础上进行的，外有美帝及梵蒂冈等的直接干涉，它们用尽恫吓、利诱，以及宗教迷信等一切无耻伎俩；内有反动派的串通一气及大肆舞弊的卑鄙行为，但即使根据意反动政府所发表的数字，人民民主阵线仍赢得全国百分之三十一以上人民的坚决拥护。在众院的选举中，人民民主阵线获得七百九十九万五千票，在参院的选举中，获得六百九十五万五千票。意共团结报在评这次选举时说：“人民民主阵线在全意各地获得政治上强有力的支持。反动派要把人民民主阵线从广大的人民大众中孤立起来的计划已经失败。”选举结果显示：共和党、萨拉盖特党、法西斯集团“国家同盟”以及法西斯党“意大利社会运动”所得票数，均微不足道，而保皇党则已遭受惨败。反动集团把他们的选票几乎全部投给了基督教民主党。据意反动政府所公布的数字，该党在参院获得一千零七十四万票；在众院获得一千二百六十八万一千票。
