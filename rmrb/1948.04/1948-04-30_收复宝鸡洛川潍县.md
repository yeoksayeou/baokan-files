    After taking Yan'an, victories came to us one after another. On the afternoon of the 25th, our army captured the city of Luochuan, south of Yan'an. On the morning of the 26th, we captured the city of Baoji. Baoji is the center of Chiang Kai-shek's important military industry in the Northwest, and the rear stronghold of Chiang Hu's bandit troops. After capturing the city, the money, ammunition and other spoils we obtained were piled up like mountains. On the 27th, our East China Army captured Weixian again. Our victories are getting bigger and bigger, and the day of Chiang Kai-shek's collapse is getting closer and closer.

    收复宝鸡洛川潍县
    打下延安之后，咱们的胜利接二连三的到来。二十五号下午我们军队打下延安南边的洛川城。二十六号早晨就打下了宝鸡城。宝鸡是蒋介石西北重要军事工业的中心，是蒋胡匪军的后方老窝子。打下城后，我们得的钱财弹药等胜利品，多得堆的象山。二十七日华东我军又打下了潍县。我们的胜利越来越大了，蒋介石垮台的日子也越来越近了。
