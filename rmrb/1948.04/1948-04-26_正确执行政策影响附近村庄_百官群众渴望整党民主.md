Correct Implementation of Policies Impacts Nearby Villages
    Baiguan Masses Eager for Party Rectification and Democracy

    [Our Dispatch] The Wu'an Ninth District work team's correct implementation of policies has impacted nearby villages, creating conditions for smooth work in those villages. The work team has now advanced to villages such as Baiguan. After arriving in Baiguan Village, they gained a general understanding of the village's situation from a district cadre and the masses who had remained in the village. That evening, they convened a branch meeting with thirty-two Party members. Initially, the atmosphere at the meeting was rather subdued, but after they understood the work team's approach and realized that the policies the work team was adopting in this village were the same as those used in other nearby villages, they became more willing to speak. They had already heard about the Party rectification situation in nearby villages and generally understood our Party rectification policies, knowing that there would be no beatings, no hangings, no deductions, no coercion, no revenge, no unjust treatment, but rather reasoning, practicality, distinguishing right from wrong, differentiating good from bad, reforming thinking, and rectifying the organization. Therefore, Party members and cadres were generally willing to participate in the rectification and even requested it be done quickly. Most had no objections to making the Party public, with only a few Party members saying, "If we go public, I'm afraid it will ruin the Party's reputation." The masses expressed great concern about the Party rectification. When the work team asked them separately for their opinions on Party members and cadres, they could distinguish good from bad themselves, pointing out who were good Party members and which ones were not so good.

    The masses had also learned about the work team's policies from villages where Party rectification and democratic replenishment work had already been carried out nearby. They were ideologically prepared and had long been looking forward to the arrival of the work team, generally requesting that work begin quickly. At this time, the cotton had already been planted, and there were not many wheat fields left to hoe, with only twenty days or so before the busy season. They were eager to seize this interval to work quickly, and their morale was high. The village had a large amount of land, with an average of 4.5 mu per person and a yield of 400-500 jin. The land distribution was generally balanced, and the masses did not have significant demands in this area. Most demanded the distribution of floating wealth (the Peasant Association still held over a thousand pieces of clothing and over ten thousand jin of grain, etc.), houses, and farm implements. The most important demand was democracy, requiring the transformation of village cadres' and Party members' work styles and the return of excess gains.

    The village had 441 households in total. Last year, a "Poor and Hired Peasants Committee" of about a hundred people had been organized when production loans were issued. A few days ago, the Ninth District Chief and others visited the village again to interview poor and hired peasants, vetting about sixty of them. Each group also elected poor and hired peasant representatives (a Poor Peasants Association has not been established yet). This was better than last year's "Poor and Hired Peasants Committee," and the work team would clarify this foundation, while also stepping outside this circle to rely on more honest poor and hired peasants who had not spoken up in the past. According to initial understanding, there were relatively few poor and hired peasants in the village. They felt isolated and, with some understanding of the policies, proactively requested unity with the middle peasants. On the middle peasant side, because they often heard vegetable vendors from nearby Hedong Village and other villages talk about the work team's implementation of policies towards middle peasants in Hedong and other villages, the general mood was stable. There were still some small grudges that they could not resolve, but they did not keep them to themselves, instead asking the work team for clarification. Compared to the past, the scope of struggle in this village was not too wide, with a total of forty-five households designated as "struggle targets." There were not many people wearing "spy" hats either. They had also learned about the policies from villages where movements had already been launched nearby and were no longer worried, feeling that there was a way out.

### 正确执行政策影响附近村庄  百官群众渴望整党民主

    正确执行政策影响附近村庄
    百官群众渴望整党民主
    【本报消息】武安九区工作团，正确执行政策，已影响到附近村庄，给这些村已打下顺利工作的条件。该工作团现已推进到百官等村。到百官村后从留村的一个区干部和群众中间大概了解了这个村的情况，当晚就召集三十二个党员开了支部会；最初会上比较沉闷，稍后他们摸清了工作组的底，知道工作组到这村和在附近别的村子时采取的政策是相同的，他们发言就比较多了。他们已听到了些附近村整党的情形，对我们整党的政策一般已经了解，知道了不打不吊不扣不逼，不许报复，不冤屈人，而是要讲道理，求实际，辨别是非，分清好坏，改造思想，整顿组织。所以党员和干部一般都愿意整，而且要求快整；有的在这第一次会上就作了一些自我批评。对于把党公开也大都没啥意见，只有少数党员说：“公开了咱，怕给党败了兴。”群众对整党表示很关心，当工作组向他们分别打听对党员干部的意见时，他们自己就能分清好坏，说出那些是好党员，那几个不很好。
    群众也都从附近已进行整党民主填补工作的村子了解到了工作组的政策，思想上有了充分的准备，早就盼望着工作组到来，普遍要求快下手作。这时棉花已种完，麦没锄的也不多了，到大忙还有二十来天的时间，他们更希望抓住这间隙快作，情绪很高涨。这村土地较多，每人平均四亩半，产量四石五，土地分配大体已经平衡，群众在这方面要求不太大，大多要求分浮财（农会尚存有一千多件衣服，一万多斤粮食等）、房子、农具；最主要的要求还是民主，要求改造村干部和党员作风，退出多得果实。
    全村四百四十一户，去年发放生产贷款时曾组织过百来人的“贫雇委员会”。前些天九区区长等又在这村访问了一回贫雇，审查好了六十来个，各组还选了贫雇代表（未成立贫农团）；这比去年的“贫雇委员会”较好，工作组就按这底子加以澄清，同时并跳出这个圈子，再多找过去不吭气的老实贫雇作依靠。据初步了解，这村贫雇较少，他们自己感到势孤，而且对政策也有些了解，主动要求团结中农。在中农方面，因为常听附近河东等村卖菜的到这村谈工作组在河东等村对中农政策的执行情形，所以一般的情绪是稳定的；也还有些解不开的小圪＠，他们也不藏在心里不说，而是向工作组探问明白。这村过去的斗争面比较起来还不算太宽，定成“斗争对象”的共四十五户；戴“特务”帽子的也不多；他们也都从附近已展开运动的村子了解了政策，不再发愁了，感到有了出路。
