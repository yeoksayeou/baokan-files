Tailism Fuels Sectarian Disputes
　　Qingyansi Work Group Reviews Lessons Learned
　　Qingyansi Village in the Ninth District of Wu'an is divided into upper and lower streets. For a long time, landlords exploited this division to incite sectarian struggles among the peasants. After the establishment of the democratic government, the landlords were overthrown, and the sectarian rifts were significantly reduced. However, some bad cadres, infected with the remnants of feudal rulers, also used the sectarian sentiments of the peasants to consolidate their own positions.

　　In this Party rectification, replenishment, and democratic movement, this sectarian rift was once again exploited by a few ambitious and vindictive elements to attack honest peasants and correct opinions. When the work group first arrived in the village, it did not guard against this point, and most of the information and investigation materials were based on what these people said. They took the opportunity to become active, slandering the hired worker Wang Maowen as a "bomb shelter," and saying that he was "in league with disreputable people," preventing the work team from approaching him, and later excluding him. They also said that the branch was terribly bad, "embezzling thirty to forty thousand for gun money alone (actually proven to be no embezzlement), and the cooperative had not accounted for three years (actually only one year without accounting)." After discovering these situations, the work group broke out of their encirclement and more broadly approached the poor peasants and hired laborers, organizing exposure and criticism of them in and out of meetings, and their arrogant emotions were temporarily suppressed. However, because the work group was afraid of taking over and doing things for the masses and of pouring cold water on the masses, it was not sufficient in encouraging and educating the masses to openly criticize and expose them, and it simply waited for the masses to rise up and fight against these people on their own. In the Party rectification work, it was thought that these people dared to speak and knew many things, and the honest peasants who participated in the Party rectification were not organized into a leading core, so in reality they still relied on them. As a result, Party members thought that it was "fighting against cadres," and "no matter how good the reflection is, it won't pass if a few people (referring to a few vindictive elements) step on your heels (meaning revenge)," "no matter if it's true or false, admit whatever is said, and pass it off vaguely!" These sectarian elements regarded Party rectification as an opportunity for personal revenge, and when they saw honest peasants not making trouble like them, they scolded them: "Why are you so useless!?" The bottom then spread the word everywhere that "no opinions are offered to Party members in the upper street" and "shielding Party members," creating division among the masses of the upper and lower streets. Liu Shouxian, a Party member from the upper street, had not dropped a vase, Wang ×× had a long-standing grudge against him and wanted revenge, forcing Liu to admit it, and a representative from the upper street did not come with him to attack Liu, causing Wang's dissatisfaction. At the class division conference, he publicly lost his temper and accused people of shielding: "You are just shielding, you don't understand the affairs of Party members, how can you understand this matter so clearly? What else is it if not shielding?" A few ambitious and vindictive elements in the upper street also took the opportunity to spread the word and deepen the division: "Look at the lower street, they are holding on tight, we get attacked back as soon as we speak!" Many people in the upper and lower streets blindly felt: "The upper and lower streets can never not be divided!"

　　The work group did not analyze and study this phenomenon or expose it in a timely manner, but instead abandoned leadership and became the tail of the masses. After going deep into the masses to understand the situation, they received a great education and took the following steps: (1) Many people clearly saw this problem. Wang ×× said: "Actually, what's the matter with the masses in the upper and lower streets? It's just those seven or eight people stirring things up!" Li ×× said: "With those few people, honest peasants will never be able to run the house, who dares to speak!?" After studying the opinions of the masses, the work group first clarified that this was not the peasants of the upper and lower streets wanting to cause division, but rather a few ambitious and vindictive elements forming small cliques, provoking contradictions between the upper and lower streets, and attempting to exploit the situation to achieve their revenge purposes. The correct opinions of the masses were taken back to the masses for widespread publicity, explaining that the peasants of the upper and lower streets were all one family, eliminating the rifts between the peasants, jointly isolating the few sectarian elements, and exposing their instigation activities. (2) The few sectarian elements were also treated differently. The outspoken "bomb shells" and the young "daredevils" were persuaded and educated to win them over, and the worst elements were isolated among the masses. (3) For sectarian activities, a combination of public exposure, individual education, and off-site exposure was adopted. Before public exposure, individual chats or small forums were used to prepare the masses ideologically, so as to avoid the masses being unable to accept it all at once or accepting it very reluctantly in a simple public exposure. Individual education was also given to those who were exposed to promote their transformation.

　　This work has not been carried out sufficiently among the masses, and is now being combined with the final stage of Party rectification work, relying on honest poor and hired peasants and middle peasants to distinguish right from wrong, so that the sectarian revenge activities of a few people are thoroughly exposed, and the class unity between peasants is further strengthened.

　　尾巴主义助长宗派纠纷
  　青烟寺工作组检讨经验教训
    武安九区青烟寺村，分为上下两街。很久以来地主就利用这个空隙，挑动农民间的宗派斗争。民主政府成立后，地主被斗倒，宗派裂痕也消除了不少。但是，有些坏干部，沾染了封建统治者的遗毒，也利用农民宗派情绪，以巩固自己的地位。
    这次整党、填补、民主运动中。这个宗派裂痕又为少数野心分子、报复分子所利用，来打击老实农民，打击正确意见。工作组初到村后，没有警惕到这点，了解情况，调查材料，都多半听信这些人的话。他们遂乘势活跃起来，污蔑雇工王茂文当“防空洞”，又说他“和不正派的人一伙伙”，阻止工作员去接近他，后来就排挤他。又说支部坏的不象样，“光枪款就贪污了三四十万（实际证明并无贪污），合作社三年没算帐（实际只有一年没算帐）。”发现这些情况后，工作组跳出他们的包围圈，更广泛的接近贫雇农，在会上和会外，组织了对他们的揭露与批评，他们的嚣张情绪暂时受到压力。但是由于工作组怕包办代替，怕给群众泼冷水，因此鼓励教育群众，公开批评揭露他们非常不够，同时单纯的等待群众自己起来与这些人斗争。在整党工作上，又认为这些人敢说话，知道事情多，对参加整党的公正的老实农民没有组织成为领导核心，因而实际上还是依靠了他们。结果，使党员认为是“在斗干部”，“反省再好，有哪几个人（指少数报复分子）踏脚后跟（报复的意思），怎也通不过”，“不管真的假的，提啥承认啥，糊涂通过就算”！这些宗派分子却把整党当作个人报复的机会，看见老实农民不跟他那样闹，反骂他们：“你们怎么这样不顶事！？”下边就到处宣传“上街不给党员提意见”，“包庇党员”，制造上下街群众的分裂，上街党员刘守湘，并没有摔过插瓶，王××和他有积恨，想报复，硬逼刘承认，上街一个代表没跟他一块来打击刘，引起王的不满。在划阶级的大会上，公开发着脾气指污人家包庇：“你就是包庇，对党员的事你摸不清圪，这个事你怎么摸的这么清？不是包庇是啥？”上街的少数野心分子、报复分子，也顺势宣传加深分裂：“你看人家下街，抱的就是紧，咱一说话就被人家打击回来啦！”上下街不少群众都盲目的感到：“上下街到哪会也不能不分裂！”
    对于这种现象，工作组没有分析研究，及时揭发，而是放弃领导作了群众的尾巴。经深入群众了解，才得到很大的教育，并采取了以下的步骤：（一）有不少群众，对这个问题看的很清楚，王××说：“其实，上下街群众有啥，就是那七八个人挑的吧！”李××说：“有那几个人，老实农民一辈子也当不了家，谁敢说话！？”研究群众的意见后，工作组首先明确了：这不是上下街农民要闹分裂，而是少数野心分子、报复分子结成了小宗派，挑动上下街矛盾，企图从中钻空子，达到报复目的。把群众这种正确意见拿回群众中去广泛宣传，说明上下街农民都是一家人，消除农民之间的裂痕，共同孤立少数宗派分子，暴露他们的挑拨活动。（二）对于少数闹宗派的分子，也分别对待，对那些心直口快的“炸弹皮”，和年青的“二杆子”们，采取多说服教育争取他们的方针，在群众中孤立少数最坏的分子。（三）对宗派活动，采取公开揭露、个别教育、会外揭发相结合的办法，在公开揭露之前，先用个别扯谈的办法，或召开小型座谈会，给群众以思想准备，免得单纯大会揭露，使群众一下子接受不了，或接受的很勉强。并对被揭露者进行个别教育，促其转变。
    这些工作，在群众中进行的还很不够，现正结合最后一段整党工作，依靠老实贫雇与中农，辨明是非，使少数人的宗派报复活动彻底暴露，进一步加强农民之间的阶级团结。
