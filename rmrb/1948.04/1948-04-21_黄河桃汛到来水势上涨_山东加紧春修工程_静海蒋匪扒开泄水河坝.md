Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: Belated news: The Yellow River's peach blossom flood has arrived. Three days before the Qingming Festival, the downstream water level had already risen by six inches compared to normal, and the water's force was stronger than in previous years, with waves constantly rising. The Shandong Democratic Provincial Government's River Affairs Bureau is stepping up its supervision of the riverine counties in the Bohai region to quickly complete the first phase of spring repair projects, and is working to reinforce dangerous works such as Dayuzhang in Lijin County. In other news: The Bohai Democratic Government, in order to dredge the Jun River and the Shibei River between Canghuang (i.e., Xinhai) and southern Tianjin (three counties) that traverse Cang County and Huanghua, began surveying on the 23rd of last month, and transported wage grain to the areas along the river. One million catties of grain were allocated to the Shibei River alone, and it is expected that all work can begin in the first half of April. According to the person in charge of the Water Conservancy Committee, after the two rivers are dredged, not only can the three counties be spared from floods, but more than 5,000 hectares of low-lying land in 72 depressions such as Dalang can be turned into fertile fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th: When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Jinghai attacked our Beizhutou and Batai areas on the 14th of last month, they breached the newly built Batai water diversion dike, causing the Ziya River water to flood into the Wen'an depression. By the 22nd, the water in the Wen'an depression had risen by two inches, and much of the spring wheat was submerged. The county's local armed forces and work teams, in order to protect the interests of the people, attacked the harassing enemy in Zhutou on the morning of the 20th, killing and capturing six enemy soldiers. The water diversion river was dug in 1946 to divert water from the Wen'an depression into the Ziya River, which is of great importance to the welfare of the people, but it has been repeatedly sabotaged by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits after it was dug.

　　黄河桃汛到来水势上涨
  　山东加紧春修工程
    静海蒋匪扒开泄水河坝
    【新华社华东十九日电】迟到消息：黄河桃汛来临，清明节前三日下游水位已较平日上涨六公寸，水势也较往年猛，不断起浪。山东民主省政府河务局正加紧督促渤海区沿河各县迅速完成第一期春修工程，并加工抢护利津县打鱼张等险工。另息：渤海民主政府为疏浚横贯沧县、黄骅（即新海）、（天）津南三县之浚河与沧黄间之石碑河，上月二十三日已开始测量，并向沿河地区运集工资粮，仅石碑河拨粮一百万斤，预计四月上半月内可全部动工。据水利委员会负责人谈，该两河疏浚后，不仅三县可免除水患，且有大浪等七十二洼五千余顷洼地可变为良田。
    【新华社晋察冀十六日电】静海蒋匪于上月十四日犯我北茁头、坝台一带时，扒开我新修之坝台泄水河坝，使子牙河水灌入文安洼，至二十二日文安洼涨水二寸，春麦多被淹没。该县地武及武工队为保卫人民利益，二十日晨在茁头袭击出扰之敌，毙俘敌六名。按该泄水河于一九四六年所挖、引文安洼水入子牙河，关系人民福利至巨，但挖好后屡遭蒋匪破坏。
