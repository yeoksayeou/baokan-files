　　Recapturing Xuchang and Xinzheng
　　Victorious news is coming from all fronts. On the Henan front: Simultaneously with the liberation of Gong County on the 7th, our army recaptured the important town of Xuchang on the Pinghan Railway for the third time, and on the 9th, we recaptured Xinzheng County, south of Zhengzhou. Fearing that we would wipe them out, the Chiang bandits tucked their tails and ran away as soon as they heard our army was coming. On the 6th, we captured Runan, capturing 300 Chiang bandits alive. Now our troops are approaching Zhengzhou step by step from the west and south. On the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning front: After our army captured Chicheng on the 6th, we also recaptured Longguan County on the 7th. On the Suiyuan front: After our army recaptured Fengzhen and Liangcheng, we recaptured Helin City on the 6th. The Fu bandits fled to Gui Sui, and now the vanguard of our army has pointed to Gui Sui. The Fu bandit Zuoyi is very scared.

　　收复许昌新郑
    胜利消息正从各线传来。河南方面：与七号解放巩县同时，咱们军队第三次收复了平汉线上的重镇许昌城，并于九号收复了郑州南的新郑县城。蒋匪怕咱们把他消灭掉，一听咱们军队来了就挟着尾巴逃跑。六号咱们攻克汝南，活捉蒋匪三百，现在咱们的部队正从西面南面步步逼近郑州。冀热辽方面：咱们军队六号攻克赤城后，七号又收复了龙关县城。绥远方面：咱们军队收复丰镇、凉城后，于六号又收复和林城，傅匪逃往归绥，现在咱们军队前锋已指向归绥，傅匪作义很害怕。
