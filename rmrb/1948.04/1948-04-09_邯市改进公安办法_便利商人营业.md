　　Handan Municipality Improves Public Security Measures
  　Facilitating Business Operations for Merchants
    [Handan City News] Director Zhou of the Municipal Public Security Bureau recently made a review of the shortcomings of past work at a merchants' meeting, and put forward opinions on resolutely protecting industry and commerce in the future. Merchants responded, "Very good! We must produce well." Director Zhou first reviewed that the implementation of the policy of protecting industry and commerce in the past was insufficient. First of all, there were problems in guaranteeing human rights, property rights, and the right to free operation. For example, the district and village were not firmly enforced in not having the right to arrest people, and there were no strict procedures. As a result, incidents such as village cadres and militiamen arresting people, street public offices detaining people, and arbitrary inspections occurred, which hindered the operation and development of industry and commerce. Also, the opening of travel permits has given merchants a lot of unnecessary restrictions. One businessman said: "Opening a travel permit is more difficult than anything else. Opening a travel permit has to pass three levels: the group leader level, the public security officer level, and the dispatched station level. The public security officer's level is not easy to pass." For example, a small merchant surnamed Xu in West Street could not get a travel permit for nine days because he lost his travel permit, and he could not go out to pick up burdens and do business. On the issue of household registration, the Municipal Bureau stipulated procedures that were too strict. Even city residents who do business at the station have to go through household registration procedures when they go home at night, and as a result, the masses of merchants are very dissatisfied. Director Zhou clearly put forward the following opinions for the future: 1. District and village have no right to arrest people. If residents and merchants violate the Land Law Outline or engage in acts that undermine the interests of the people, they must report to the municipal government for approval and hold an arrest warrant from the Municipal Public Security Bureau before they can be executed, otherwise they can refuse arrest. Except for current criminals. 2. Inspections must be approved by the Public Security Bureau and executed with an inspection certificate from the Public Security Bureau. 3. Open the travel permit whenever you arrive, without going through the group leader or the public security officer, and you can open it with your household registration and temporary outing form, and the time can be longer. For more than three months, a certificate from the Federation can be used. For state-owned stores to open travel permits, in addition to the household registration, a note with the seal of the manager and supervisor can be used. For more than three months, a certificate from the public committee can be used. If merchants from other counties have business relations with businesses in this city, and the travel permit is lost or expired, a new pass or another certificate can be issued with the certificate of the Federation. 4. On the issue of household registration, villagers coming to live in this city only need a certificate from the village public office, but residents from other cities coming to live in this city only need a certificate from the dispatched station in that city. When transferring household registration in the station, the four gates of the city, and the three passes, you must go to the dispatched station to go through household registration procedures and obtain a certificate, and the villages can handle it at the village public office. Citizens, merchants, hawkers, etc. in the station and Chengguan District of this city who operate in the city and go home at night shall have all household registration procedures cancelled. All state-owned stores opening in this city must have a certificate from the original agency and a business license from the Industry and Commerce Bureau to report household registration. Employees hired by stores must have a certificate from the village public office and a review by the person in charge of the store before they can report household registration. After the report, the merchants said: "This really solves the problem. The government protects, the bank provides loans, and the Public Security Bureau issues travel permits. It is really good. There is nothing to say if this is not good for production."

　　邯市改进公安办法
  　便利商人营业
    【邯郸市消息】市公安局周局长，日前在商人大会上，对过去工作的缺点作了检讨，并提出了今后坚决保护工商业的意见，商人反映“好的很！一定要好好生产”。周局长首先检讨过去对保护工商业政策的执行上是不够的，首先在保障人权、财权及自由经营权利上是有毛病的，如对区村无捕人权未有坚决执行，也无严格的手续，因而发生村干民兵捕人、街公所扣人、随意检查等现象，这是有碍工商业的经营与发展的。又如开路条子，也给予商人不少不必要的限制，曾有一个商人说：“开路条比什么都困难，开一个路条得过三关：小组长一关、公安员一关、派驻所一关，数公安员的关不好过。”如西大街姓徐的小商人，因路条失掉，九天开不出路条，不能出门挑担做生意。在户口问题上，市局规定手续过严，甚至城里人在车站作买卖，夜间回家也要办户口手续，结果群众商人都很不满。周局长明确提出今后意见：一、区村无捕人权，居民商人如有违犯土地法大纲、破坏人民利益行为，得报告市政府批准，持有市公安局逮捕证，方可执行，否则可以拒捕。现刑犯例外。二、检查时须经公安局批准，并持有公安局检查证方可执行。三、开路条啥时到，啥时开，不经过小组长，公安员，带上户口、临时外出表即可开出，时间长些也可以。在三个月以上可经联合会的证明即可。公营商店开路条，除带有户口外，有经理、监委盖章开个条子即可。三个月以上的，有公委会证明即可。外县与本市商号有营业关系，路条遗失或过期，经该联合会证明即可另开通行证或另写证明。四、户口问题，乡村来本市居住有村公所证明即可，但其他城市居民来本市居住，有该城派驻所的证明即可。车站、城关四门里、三关迁移户口时，须到派驻所办户口手续领取证明，乡村就在村公所办理。本市车站，城关区之市民商人摊贩等，在市内营业，晚上回家时一律取消户口手续。凡在本市开设公营商店报户口，须有原来机关公函证明，及工商局营业证，商店雇用人员要有村公所证明及该商号负责人审查，即可报户口。报告后，商人说：“这一下真解决问题，政府保护，银行贷款，公安局发给路条，真是好了，这要不好好生产就没话说。”
