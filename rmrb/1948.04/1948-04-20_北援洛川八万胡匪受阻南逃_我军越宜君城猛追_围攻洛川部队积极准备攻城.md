Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, Urgent Telegram, 17th: The Hu Zongnan bandit troops, numbering over 80,000, who were reinforcing the isolated city of Luochuan, were subjected to a forceful blockade by the People's Liberation Army forces on the afternoon of the 16th and have already turned south to flee. Our army immediately gave chase, and the vanguard has already crossed Yijun City and is currently continuing the pursuit. These enemy troops occupied Yijun on the 11th of this month, and then entrenched themselves without advancing. On the 14th, they probed forward, advancing only 15 li in two days, and then fled south after being blocked by our forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th: The People's Liberation Army units besieging Luochuan are intensifying their preparations for the city assault and, under centralized command, are employing military democracy to harness the wisdom of the masses. The First Company of the Fifth Battalion of a certain unit recently conducted a live-ammunition drill for storming the city. Starting from a concealed position two hundred meters from the city, they successfully completed complex operations such as mine sweeping, blasting, bridge building, assault, and scaling the city walls in under one and a half hours. Before the drill, the unit organized various combat teams according to specific attack tasks and practiced and studied tactical movements separately. The Third Squad also created a model of Luochuan city in the suburbs, detailing the minefields within each of the Chiang bandit fortifications on the outskirts, the city's street defenses, and the locations of Chiang Hu's machine guns, etc. Cadres carefully guided the soldiers' movements according to the model, correcting any improper use of terrain or unsuitable actions on the spot. The First Squad of the Sixth Battalion of a certain unit recently conducted a mobilization for the assault on Luochuan city. The squad successively convened an expanded meeting of the Party branch committee and a general meeting of all Party members, calling on Communist Party members to resolutely capture Luochuan city. They proposed undertaking the assault to achieve merit, preparing for continuous combat, not relying on others, not damaging tools, and guaranteeing that the unit would resolutely and thoroughly complete its task and implement the Party's policies. After the Party mobilization, an administrative squad affairs meeting was convened to convey the attack mission assigned by the higher authorities, discuss the objective and subjective conditions for capturing Luochuan, and how to command the troops during combat. Specific tasks were determined, and combat organizations such as mine-sweeping teams, blasting teams, grenade-throwing teams, and rescue teams were established. At the squad's military meeting, the following specific mobilization slogans were put forward: "Three Fears Not": "Fear not landmines; Fear not wide outer moats; Fear not enemy fire." In addition, the slogans "Three Charges and Three Necessities" were proposed, emphasizing seizing the attack opportunity, promoting encirclement tactics, and observing the policies regarding prisoners and urban areas.
