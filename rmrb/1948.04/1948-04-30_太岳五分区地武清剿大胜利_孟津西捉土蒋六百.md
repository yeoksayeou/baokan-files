    Taiyue, 28th (This newspaper dispatch) After the Taiyue Fifth Military Sub-district local armed forces cooperated in the second recapture of Luoyang and Mengjin, they achieved a great victory in suppressing scattered soldiers and local Chiang bandits west of Mengjin. Around Chen'ao and Matun west of Mengjin, there were about two thousand scattered soldiers who had fled from Luoyang and local Chiang bandits from Mengjin who specialized in sabotage and disruption of our rear. Our Fifth Military Sub-district local armed forces, in conjunction with the militia, cleared out the local bandits. From the 19th to the 21st, in just two days, they defeated this group of scattered soldiers and local Chiang bandits. More than 600 local Chiang bandits, from squad leader down, were captured alive, more than 140 were killed or wounded, and 216 rifles, a radio transmitter, and a telephone were seized, along with many other military supplies. Small groups of local bandits hurriedly surrendered and turned in their weapons. For example, more than 50 members of the 18th Bao squadron of Mengjin all brought their weapons and surrendered. In these few days, a total of more than 300 rifles were seized. On the 13th, the local armed forces of the Fifth Military Sub-district captured more than 20 members of the local Chiang bandit Zhang Chengxin's unit in Fuzhen, more than 30 li southwest of Mianchi, seizing one machine gun and 24 rifles. On the 15th, in Guanzhuang, 25 li northeast of Luoning, they captured alive the local Chiang bandit detachment deputy Ji Delu and company commander Song Fuxue and 23 others, seizing one mortar, one heavy machine gun, and 16 rifles. During the second recapture of Luoyang, they also captured alive Guo Tanyu, the puppet county magistrate of Luoyang who fled from Luoyang, as well as the puppet county government secretary and the head of the finance section. Currently, with the exception of two groups of local bandits on the railway line more than 50 li west of Mianchi leading to Shaanxi and west of Luoning, the remaining small groups of local bandits dare not operate.
    Taiyue, 28th (This newspaper dispatch) Yan bandits robbed grain, forcing the people to sell their children and seek death by hanging. In Dongquan Town, Pingyao, more than 700 households, except for a few large landlords, were robbed of every grain of food and had to eat coarse bran and bean cakes to survive temporarily. After Li Gengcheng's family of four finished eating the bran and vegetables, his two children cried from hunger and gnawed at the dirt. Gengcheng, unable to bear to let his children starve to death, sold the youngest for two dou of rice. Just as he brought the rice home, the Yan bandits followed him in. Gengcheng and his wife had to plead and beg, "This is the rice from selling a child. Please leave some for us so that the child on the kang can eat. He is about to starve to death! Please have mercy." The Yan bandit said heartlessly, "You're afraid your child will starve to death? We'll just kill him for you, and he won't starve to death." As he spoke, he threw the child out of the window into the yard, killing him, and then laughing, he carried away the two dou of rice. Gengcheng and his wife, seeing that their children had been sold and killed, and that there was no food in the house and no way to survive, hanged themselves together. In addition, Li Goucheng, Li Ergou, and four or five others also starved to death in the third month of the lunar calendar.
