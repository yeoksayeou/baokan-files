    Should Landlords With No Food Be Helped?
    To the Editor:
    After reading the news "Hexi New Village Government Actively Solves Spring Farming Difficulties" in your newspaper on April 6th, I have a question. That is, in the news, lines 9 to 11 say: Recently, after distributing the remaining fruit, seven hundred catties of grain and one hundred and fifty catties of corn, in addition to a small portion given to three households lacking food and the old, weak, and poor hired laborers, the rest was distributed to well-to-do middle peasants lacking food and landlords with no food at present.
    Regarding whether landlords who currently have no food can eat the fruit grain, if they can, what conditions are there? Or can they eat it if they are simply lacking food? Are they allowed to eat for free? Or are they allowed to eat temporarily and pay it back later? Please answer.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Yang Changxin, Xu Bude)
    Comrades Yang Changxin and Xu Bude: There were no conditions attached to Hexi Village distributing grain to landlords who currently have no food when distributing the remaining fruit. This is because they were given land during the land redistribution, but they currently have no food, and picking and chopping is barely enough to survive, making it impossible to carry out spring farming. From the remaining fruit grain, in addition to meeting the needs of the poor hired laborers, some grain was also distributed to them to solve the current production difficulties and allow them to focus on spring farming, which is beneficial to production. If this were not done, their land would not be planted, which would be wrong. When dealing with this issue, we did not consider whether landlords could eat fruit grain, but rather how to transform landlords, provide them with the necessary living conditions, and enable them to produce, in order to increase social wealth. This is fully in line with what Comrade Ren Bishi said in "Several Questions in Land Reform": "We adopt a policy of eliminating the landlord class's system of exploitation, but we do not adopt a policy of eliminating individual landlords. All landlords, except for a few traitors and war criminals convicted by the court, should be given land and property in accordance with the Land Law Outline, no more and no less than the peasants, forced to work, and transformed. Because landlords, after participating in labor, are a considerable productive force, we should not abandon this productive force." Therefore, in addition to distributing a share of land to them during the land redistribution, Hexi also paid attention to providing landlords with the conditions for production and life. Doing so is based on the interests of the peasants, and it is more in line with the long-term interests of the peasants than allowing the landlords to leave their land barren while the peasants receive a little more fruit grain in the short term.

### 眼下没吃的地主是否应该接济？

　　眼下没吃的地主是否应该接济？编辑同志：
    看了贵报四月六日所载“河西新选村政府、积极解决春耕困难”的消息后，有一个疑问，就是这消息中第九行至十一行所说：最近分配剩余果实，七百斤谷子，一百五十斤玉茭，除很少一部分给三户缺粮及老弱贫雇外，其余都分给了缺粮的斗错中农及眼下没吃的地主。
    关于地主眼下没吃的是否可以吃果实粮，如吃还有什么条件呢？还是缺粮就可以吃？叫他白吃？还是叫他暂时吃了将来再还？请作答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（杨长欣、徐补德）
    杨长欣、徐补德同志：河西村在分配剩余果实时，给眼下没吃的地主分配粮食并没有什么条件。因为填补中给了他们土地，而他们眼下没吃的，每天拾砍刚够糊口，没法进行春耕。从剩余果实粮中，除满足贫雇要求外，并分给了他们一些粮食，解决目前生产困难，使他们安心春耕，这对生产是有利的。如果不这样做，他们的地种不上，是不对的。我们处理这个问题时，不是从地主能否吃果实粮这一点考虑，而是从改造地主，给予必须生活条件，使他能够生产，以增加社会财富。这完全符合任弼时同志在“土地改革中的几个问题”中所说：“我们对地主的阶级剥削制度，是采取消灭政策，但对地主个人则不是采取消灭政策。对一切地主除少数汉奸及内战罪犯，经法庭判定罪者外，均应按土地法大纲分给不比农民多也不比农民少的土地财产，强迫他们劳动，改造他们。因为地主参加劳动后，是不小的一批生产力，我们不应当抛弃这批生产力”。因之，河西在抽补中除分给他们一份土地外，并注意了给地主以生产和生活条件。这样做是从农民利益出发的，比让地主们荒了地，而农民眼前多分一点果实粮，更符合于农民的长远利益。
