    Banks Issue Large Loans to Support Industry and Commerce
    Linqing Market Becomes Increasingly Prosperous
    [This newspaper reports] The policy of protecting industry and commerce stipulated in the Outline Land Law has been warmly supported by businessmen and residents throughout Linqing City since its promulgation. The municipal government also held a forum for businessmen in the city, expressing the government's attitude of protecting industry and commerce, and at the same time asked businessmen to offer opinions and review the problems that existed in industry and commerce in the past. After the meeting, businessmen from various industries held meetings for seven or eight days, and put forward many opinions on past burdens, taxation, and labor-capital relations. In order to support the development of commerce, Ruihua Bank and the Jinan Bank's Linqing City branch issued a large number of industrial and commercial loans. Every day, merchants crowded to the bank to apply for loans to expand their industrial and commercial operations. Ruihua Bank started lending from March 1st, and by the end of the month had lent out 60,000,000 Yuan in Jin currency. From April 1st to 10th, the Jinan Bank's Linqing City branch lent out more than 100,000,000 Yuan in Jin currency. The main borrowers were merchants of local products and foreign goods who were running to the Liberated Areas, as well as small vendors. After the merchants obtained the loans, the market immediately became active. Recently, due to the victorious offensive of our army on the Jiaoji Railway, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits panicked and blockaded Jinan. Merchants who used to run to Jinan temporarily changed to running to the Liberated Areas. Now there are many merchants going to Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, Dezhou, Bozhen, Xingtai, Handan, Changzhi and other places to do business, selling native cloth, towels, etc. to various Liberated Areas, and buying back iron, magnetic, bamboo, hemp, salt, cotton yarn, etc. The more than 50 bamboo ware businesses in Zhugan Lane are piled high with bamboo goods and various exquisite finished products, and are now continuing to rush to make finished products, preparing to sell them at the upcoming April fair. Jinmei Sauce Garden, a famous garden in Linqing City, did not understand the government's policy of protecting industry and commerce in the past, and maintained the status quo in its operations, not daring to boldly develop upward. Last year, many jars were idle and not pickling vegetables, but now hundreds of jars are filled with pickles. Merchants who ran to Chiang Kai-shek's area in the past because they did not understand the government's policy of protecting industry and commerce have recently returned one after another. Ren Liting of Heng Kanghao in Mashi Street, after returning from Tianjin, expanded Heng Kang and changed it to Zengyi Grocery Store, and went to Tianjin to purchase goods half a month ago. After Sui Yuzhai of Tianxiang Hualiang Store and Xu Huanan of Pipa Lane returned, they immediately started preparations for business and established operations. In order to implement the industrial and commercial policy and support small merchants and poor citizens' production, the Linqing Municipal Government also issued low-interest loans. By the 5th of this month, most of them had been lent to the citizens. Those who received loans were small vendors, porters, vegetable sellers, firewood cutters, pushcart drivers, and other poor citizens. The number of loan households was 2,375, with a total of 100,398,000 Yuan in Jin currency. The masses who received loans immediately started small businesses, while others prepared to expand their existing businesses. The entire Linqing market showed a scene of prosperity.

    银行发放大批贷款扶植工商业
    临清市场日趋繁荣
    【本报消息】土地法大纲所规定的保护工商业政策，在临清市公布后，获得全市商民的热烈拥护。市政府并于市内召开商人座谈会，表明政府保护工商业的态度，同时要求商民提意见，检讨过去在工商业中所存在的问题。会后，各行业商人开了七、八天会，对过去负担上、税收上、劳资关系上都提了很多意见。为扶助商业发展，即由瑞华银行及冀南银行临清市行发放大批工商业贷款。每天贷款商人非常拥挤，都争着到银行贷款扩大工商业经营。瑞华银行从三月一日开始贷款，到月底即贷出冀钞六万万元。冀南银行临清市行从四月一日到十日，贷出冀钞一万万多元。贷款的主要是跑解放区的土产商人及外货行商，再就是小摊贩。商民获得贷款后，市面立刻活跃起来。最近因我军在胶济线的胜利攻势，蒋匪恐慌，封锁济南，过去跑济南的商人，即暂时改跑解放区。现在去石家庄、沧县、德州、泊镇、邢台、邯郸、长治等地跑买卖的商人很多，把土布、毛巾等，推销到解放区各地，购回铁、磁、竹、麻、盐、棉纱等。竹竿巷的五十多家竹器业、竹贷和各种精细成品都堆得满满的，现正继续赶制成品，准备在快要到来的四月会上销售。临清市内著名的济美酱园，过去因为对政府保护工商业的政策不了解，在经营上维持现状，不敢大胆向上发展，去年有许多缸闲着不腌菜，现在数百口缸都已腌得满满的。过去因为不明了政府保护工商业政策，跑到蒋区去的商人最近也陆续回来。马市街恒康号任利庭，从天津回来以后，把恒康扩大，改成增益杂货店，半月前又去天津办货去了。东营街天祥花粮店睢玉斋，琵琶巷徐化南回来以后，即重新着手筹备买卖，成立业务。为贯彻工商业政策，支持小商人及贫苦市民生产，临清市政府并发放低利贷款，到本月五日，大部已贷到市民手里。得到贷款的是小摊贩、脚行、卖青菜的、打劈柴的、推大把车子的等等贫苦市民。贷款户数两千三百七十五户，共贷冀钞一万万零三百九十八万元。贷到款的群众，有的马上做小买卖，有的则准备扩大原有的买卖。整个临清市场，表现了一片繁荣的景象。
