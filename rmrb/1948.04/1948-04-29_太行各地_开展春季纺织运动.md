Taihang Message:

    Under the slogans of "Production for Self-Relief" (in disaster areas) and "Getting Rich" (in non-disaster areas), the Taihang Spring Textile Campaign is being rolled out comprehensively. Incomplete statistics from more than 20 counties, including Shahe, Wu'an, Linxian, Shexian, Neiqiu, Zanhuang, Heshun, Pingshun, Huguan, and Qinyang, show that more than 200,000 women have joined the textile campaign since the beginning of spring and have achieved initial results. Excluding self-use and purchases by small vendors, the trade company alone (excluding the Fourth District) has purchased 404,000 jin of homespun cloth by April 10th. Women in 16 counties, including Yuanshi, Zanhuang, and Xingtai in Jixi, and Yushe, Wuxiang, and Heshun in Jinzhong, have launched the second Spring Hundred-Day Textile Campaign. Yuanshi, Zanhuang, and other six counties plan to produce 2.5 million jin of homespun cloth in 80 days. The Shahe Special District Six is expected to complete 500,000 jin of homespun cloth by early May, with more than 50,000 textile women already participating in the campaign, producing more than 10,000 jin of homespun cloth per day. The Second Special District instructed all counties to achieve the following in the Hundred-Day Textile Campaign: (1) Transform non-textile areas into textile areas; (2) Textile for disaster relief, textile for emancipation, and textile for self-sufficiency; (3) Do not let any machine or vehicle be idle; (4) Do not seek excessive profits, but spin whenever there is a profit. It called on all women in the district to strive to complete 600,000 jin of homespun cloth. Xiyang, Heshun, Wuxiang, and Zuoquan are expected to complete 360,000 jin of homespun cloth in a hundred days. To support mass textile production, local governments, county and district cooperatives, and state-owned stores have provided raw materials and tools and purchased homespun cloth in large quantities to solve various difficulties for the masses, such as raw materials, tools, and sales channels. In terms of raw material supply, the Taihang Trading Company has stored 3 million jin of cotton to regulate textile raw materials throughout the district. State-owned stores in the First and Second Special Districts also have more than 2.5 million jin of cotton in stock to supply to textile women in various places. In addition to lending cotton, the Zuoquan County Cooperative also allocated 900,000 yuan in funds to support textile production. The Shahe County District Cooperative in the Sixth Special District also has 380,000 jin of cotton ready, specifically for textile women's raw materials. The woven cloth has also found outlets in a timely manner. The trading company of the First District has established 14 retail outlets in various counties to exchange grain and cotton for and purchase homespun cloth from the masses. The Xingtai City outlet of the company purchases an average of 100,000 square feet of cloth per day, and Neiqiu City purchases 150,000 square feet per market day. In addition to its own purchases, the company also organizes various cooperatives and private merchants to promote sales. To take care of the outlets for homespun cloth in the disaster areas of Pindding, Taigu, and Shouyang, various commercial firms in the Second District decided to purchase all cloth regardless of quality, in order to promote production for self-relief in the disaster areas. Women have obtained great profits from textile production, and their textile enthusiasm has also been raised. Women in Shahe earn a net profit of 1,050 yuan per jin of cloth produced. The 50,000 textile women produced 500,000 jin of cloth in 50 days, earning more than 500 million yuan. Women in Yuanshi, Zanhuang, and other counties can exchange one jin of good cloth for nine jin of rice. In Yuanshi County, which is severely affected by disasters, textile production for self-relief has played a significant role in overcoming the disaster.
