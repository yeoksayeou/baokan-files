　　【Taiyue News】On the 24th of last month, Yangcheng convened more than 600 people, including village cadres, representatives of poor and hired peasants from various districts and villages, and representatives of working women, to mobilize spring ploughing, holding meetings for seven consecutive days. Originally, some of the people who came to the meeting thought they were going to discuss equal distribution, some were prepared to complain, and some cadres were prepared to be struggled against, so they were not enthusiastic about discussing spring ploughing and production at the beginning. Based on this situation, County Chief Wang mobilized separately on the second morning, first calling on village cadres to actively lead production. He also pointed out to the representatives of the poor and hired peasants that they should not wait for equal distribution, and that women should not only talk about marriage issues, but should focus on studying the current major event - spring ploughing work. After mobilization, most of them began to connect with reality, examining the winter work of last year and the production situation of various villages since the beginning of spring. They found that very few people carried manure, some carried a part, and some did not carry it at all, and the mood for production was very low. It was concluded that the first thing hindering this year's spring ploughing production was that some of the poor peasant leagues and poor peasant groups organized in the autumn and winter of last year were secretly controlled by a few bad elements and a few village cadres, who were engaged in random struggles in the villages, struggling against many middle peasants and sealing the doors of many middle peasants. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 53 middle-peasant households were struggled against, and 181 middle-peasant households were sealed, and even more middle peasants were put under control, a total of 878 households. One village in Yubei controlled 34 middle-peasant households, and Yaotou controlled 40 households. There were many tricks in various villages to harm the interests of middle peasants and squeeze out middle peasants. For example, Nanmenhe bought the cattle of middle peasants at low prices, and even confiscated the oil, salt, and honey of middle peasants. During last year's winter loans, the credit departments of some district cooperatives forcibly raised funds from middle peasants by administrative order. Some villages arbitrarily withdrew the deposits of middle peasants in the cooperatives. Some mutual aid teams did not implement equivalent exchange, requiring middle peasants to work for poor and hired peasants without compensation. Some villages did not allow middle peasants to participate in leading production. For example, all 42 middle-peasant group leaders in Jianli Village were "re-elected." How can middle peasants feel at ease with such chaos!? And no one explained the policy to them, so they had misunderstandings and began to eat and drink extravagantly. Some even deliberately damaged things and sold things. Middle peasant Pei Xuezhen from Xiafu was afraid of equal distribution and sold half a livestock for 6,000 yuan at a low price. Middle peasant Shang Cang from Yuanxing was making dried noodles one night when he heard that the poor and hired peasants were going to check household registrations, so he poured the soup and noodles into the sewage basin and fed them to the pigs. Middle peasant Wang Shuanwang from Yangbai hanged all ten lambs. As a result, the village was in chaos, and everyone was not in the mood to work, which greatly delayed the spring ploughing work. These wrong practices were all reviewed and criticized at this meeting. County Chief Wang affirmed in his summary: "Infringing on the interests of middle peasants is not a small problem, but a big mistake, and it must be corrected immediately." In the future, it is not allowed to seal the doors of middle peasants or control middle peasants in the name of poor and hired peasants, it is not allowed to confiscate the capital stock of middle peasants in cooperatives, and it is not allowed to force middle peasants to be "enlightened." In mutual aid teams, whether they are poor peasants or middle peasants, equivalent exchange should be carried out, and it is not allowed to force middle peasants to work for others without compensation. It is also necessary to absorb activists from among the middle peasants to participate in leading production and not exclude them. (There are separate decisions on how to deal with those who have already harmed the interests of middle peasants.)

　　Another problem is that some poor and hired peasants have not turned over or have not completely turned over, have no grain to eat, and have no good land to cultivate. In addition, this year's spring famine is very serious. Among the 210,000 people in the county, there are currently more than 5,700 households without food and drink. This is a very big problem. We must make great efforts to solve it by various means, and we must seek solutions from spring ploughing loans, grain loans, and accumulated fruits. If there are charitable granaries, they should be opened. Finally, County Chief Wang called on cadres to solve problems ideologically, truly serve the broad masses of peasants, and if they have made mistakes in the past, they should know their mistakes and correct them. They should actively and earnestly lead the masses in production and do a good job in spring ploughing. Representatives of poor and hired peasants should stand firm, not be fooled by bad people, not be infected with bad habits, and unite closely with everyone to engage in production. We must ensure that the spring ploughing work is done well and not allow an acre of land to be wasted.

### 阳城集会推动春耕　严格制止侵害中农

　　阳城集会推动春耕
  　严格制止侵害中农
    【太岳消息】上月二十四日，阳城召集各村干部各区村贫雇农代表和劳动妇女代表六百多人动员春耕，连开七天。原来来开会的人，有的以为是要研究平分，有的准备来诉苦，有的干部准备来被斗争，所以开始对春耕生产讨论不起劲。根据这种情形，第二天早上王县长分别动员，首先号召村干部积极领导生产。并在贫雇代表中指出不应等待平分，妇女亦不应只谈婚姻问题，都应集中研究当前大事——春耕工作。经过动员后，大多数都开始连系实际，检查去年冬季工作及入春以来各村生产情形，发现担起粪的人很少，有些担了一部分，有些根本没担，生产情绪很低。研究出阻碍今年春耕生产的第一件事，是去年秋冬组织起来的贫雇团贫雇组，有些被少数坏分子及少数村干部暗中掌握了，在村中乱搞斗争，斗了很多中农，封了许多中农的门。据不完全的统计，共斗了五十三户中农，封了一百八十一户中农的门，管制起来的中农更多，共八百七十八户。峪北一个村就管制起三十四户中农，窑头管制了四十户，各村伤害中农利益的和排挤中农的花样很多。比如南门河用低价买了中农的牛，连中农的油盐蜂蜜也没收了。去年冬季贷款中，有的区联社的信贷部，用行政命令强迫中农集资。有的村随便抽用中农在合作社的存款。有的互助组中不实行等价交换，要中农无代价的替贫雇劳动。有的村不准中农参加领导生产。比如匠礼村四十二个中农小组长，都给“改选”掉了。这样乱搞的结果，中农怎样能安心呢！？又没人向他们解释政策，于是他们便发生了误会，大吃二喝起来。有的还故意损坏东西卖东西。下伏中农裴学贞怕平分，把半个牲口六千块钱贱卖了。元兴中农上仓有，有一夜正在做干面吃，听说贫雇要查户口，连汤带面倒进恶水盆里喂了猪。杨柏中农王拴旺，把十个羊羔都吊死了。这样，村里被斗的乱动动的，大家都没心思劳动，大大耽误了春耕工作。对这种错误的干法，在这次会上都作了检讨批判。王县长在总结时，肯定的说：“侵犯中农利益不是个小毛病，是个大错误，要立即纠正。”以后不准假借贫雇名义封中农的门，管制中农，不准没收中农合作社的股本，不准强迫中农“开明”。在互助组中不管是贫农中农，要等价交换，不准强迫中农无代价的给旁人劳动，还要吸收中农中的积极分子参加领导生产，不能排挤。（对已经伤害了中农利益的怎样办，另有决定。）
    再一个问题就是有些贫雇农没翻身或没彻底翻身，没粮吃、没好地种，加上今年春荒很严重，全县二十一万人口中，眼下没有吃喝的就有五千七百多户，这是一个很大的问题。一定要下大力用各种办法解决，要从春耕贷款贷粮中，从积存果实中求得解决。有义仓的要开义仓。末了王县长号召干部从思想上解决问题，真正为广大农民办事，如果过去犯了错误，要知错改错，要积极努力老老实实领导群众生产，把春耕工作作好。贫雇代表要站稳立场，不要上了坏人的当，不要染上了坏作风，要和大家紧紧团结起来闹生产。保证把春耕工作作好，不能叫荒了一亩地。
