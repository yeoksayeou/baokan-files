　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 4th: TASS, New York: At a mass meeting held to protest against American exploitation of Puerto Rico, American Communist leader Foster delivered a speech stating that the terrible situation of the working people of Puerto Rico is a symbol of the pain of human exploitation. Foster vehemently denounced Truman's attempt to turn the whole world into a giant Puerto Rico and condemned his speech in Congress on the 17th as a brazen call for war against democratic countries. Puerto Rican Communist leader Coles said that the Puerto Rican people enjoy less freedom than the people under the rule of the Spanish tyrant. The three thousand people present at the meeting finally passed a resolution demanding that the United States allow Puerto Rico to be independent and withdraw American troops; and called on the Puerto Rican people to elect Wallace in the general election.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 4th: New York: The "Wallace for President National Committee" announced that the "Month of Peace" movement launched by the committee began on the 30th of last month with a series of demonstrations. Demonstration rallies have been held successively in many major cities in California, Ohio, Georgia, West Virginia, and other states. At a mass meeting sponsored by the Italian-American Committee Supporting Wallace, Wallace fiercely criticized the Truman Doctrine, saying: "This doctrine aims to oppose democracy and sacrifice American taxpayers to carry out the most blatant exploitation of foreign resources." He condemned "American interference in the Italian elections as un-American and undemocratic." At the same time, Wallace expressed optimism about the future of the Third Party's participation in the election at a press conference, saying: "I firmly believe that millions of American people will express their determination to be a peace warrior in the election." Third Party vice-presidential candidate Senator Taylor angrily denounced: "The American warlords have replaced Hitler and assumed the leadership of the world's fascist reactionaries." Labor Party Congressman Isaacson delivered a speech at a peace demonstration in Washington, attacking Truman's "war party" policy. The leaders of the "Women Supporting Wallace Committee" said in a statement to the press: "American women are deeply worried about domestic war maniacs, and we urge Congress to reject Truman's proposals for conscription and compulsory military training."
