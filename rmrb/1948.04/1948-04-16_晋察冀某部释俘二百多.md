　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 14th—A certain unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region released over two hundred captured Chiang Kai-shek army officers at the rank of colonel and major, along with some of their family members, again in late March. Among them were Tao Xueyuan, Colonel and Commander of the 20th Regiment of the 7th Division of the 3rd Army of the Chiang army; Yang Jun, Colonel Chief of Staff of the 10th Column of the Yan army; Jiao Qinghong, Deputy Commander of the Yuci Garrison District; and Bai Huajun, Lieutenant Colonel Director of the News Office of the 19th Regiment of the 7th Division of the 3rd Army. Most of them were captured in the battles of Shijiazhuang, Qingfengdian, and Zhengtai last year. When they left, just as the spring offensive of the People's Liberation Army brought frequent victories, they said very happily: "If the fighting continues like this, Beiping and Taiyuan should be liberated in the latter half of the year. We'll welcome you there in the future!"
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Frontline, 13th—After the People's Liberation Army captured Tianzhen, the wounded bandits of Fu Zuoyi and the injured members of the feudal reactionary organization "Red Cross" of Fu Zuoyi were all treated. The health department of a certain unit treated more than thirty people within two days. A soldier of Fu Zuoyi's army who attempted to escape and was injured falling from the city wall, upon hearing that our army also provided medicine to the wounded prisoners, turned back to the city and found the People's Liberation Army and asked, "Comrade, where do I go to get medicine?" He regretted that he had mistakenly believed Fu Zuoyi's deceptive propaganda that "the Eighth Route Army shoots prisoners." He said, "If I had known that the People's Liberation Army was so lenient, I would have surrendered a long time ago, and I wouldn't have jumped off the city wall." Furthermore, Liu Liansheng, a soldier of a certain unit of our army, captured four prisoners in the battle to recover Weixian County. Because he was chasing the enemy, he lost contact with his entire squad. He escorted the four prisoners alone, looking for his unit, explaining to the prisoners the lenient policy of our army towards prisoners as he walked. The four prisoners happily said, "You really won't kill us. We want to hand over our weapons to repay you." Then they led Liu Liansheng back to the place where they were originally captured and took out four 7.9 rifles, four hundred rounds of ammunition, and a document from the fortifications. After Liu Liansheng and the prisoners returned to the unit, they were welcomed by everyone.

　　晋察冀某部释俘二百多
    【新华社晋察冀十四日电】晋察冀某部三月下旬再度释放被俘蒋军校尉级军官及一部家属二百三十余人。内有蒋军三军七师二十团上校团长陶学渊，阎军十纵队上校参谋长杨俊、榆次团管区副司令焦清洪，三军七师十九团中校新闻室主任柏化君等。他们大部分是去年在石家庄、清风店及正太等战役中被俘的。当他们走的时候，正是解放军春季攻势捷报频传，他们很愉快的说：照这样打下去，后半年北平、太原就该解放了，将来在那里欢迎你们吧。
    【新华社晋察冀前线十三日电】解放军攻克天镇后，对傅匪伤员及傅匪封建反动组织之“红会”受伤分子，均予以治疗。某部卫生处两日内医治三十余人。一个企图逃跑而跳城摔伤的傅匪士兵，听到我军也给被俘伤员上药，又转回城里，找到了解放军问道：“同志，到哪上药去呀？”他很后悔不该误信傅匪的“八路军枪杀俘虏”的欺骗宣传。他说：“要是知道解放军这样宽大，我一定早早缴枪，也不跳城了。”又我某部战士刘连生，在收复蔚县战斗中，捉到四名俘虏，因追击敌人与全班失去联系，他一个人押着四个俘虏找部队，一面走一面向俘虏讲解我军优俘政策。四名俘虏高兴的说：“真不杀我们，我们要缴出武器报答你。”接着领上刘连生回到原来被俘的地方，从工事里掏出四支七九步枪，四百发子弹和一部文件。刘连生和俘虏回部到队后，受到大家的欢迎。
