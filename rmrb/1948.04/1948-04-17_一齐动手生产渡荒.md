　　The Border Region Government has issued a call to mobilize all of our people in the region to work together to produce and overcome the famine. This is a major event, and we must respond to the call from higher authorities, intensify spring plowing, and get to work quickly! This year's famine in the Border Region is very serious, with about one-seventh of our compatriots affected. Although governments at all levels have come up with many solutions, the famine-stricken area is too large, and we, the people, must all come up with solutions and work together. In addition, the victories at the front are constantly expanding, and we also need to increase grain production to strive for complete victory. We must produce with the same energy as the soldiers at the front fighting for victory. Currently, some areas in our Border Region are undergoing redistribution, while others have not yet. Those who have been allocated land must work hard in production, otherwise the allocation will be in vain. Those who have not been allocated land should not be half-hearted and afraid of this and that. The Border Region Government's announcement is whoever plants, harvests. Now everything must be done according to policy, and no one can act arbitrarily. Don't worry! Concentrate on production!

　　一齐动手生产渡荒
    边区政府发了个号召，动员咱全区老百姓一齐动手生产渡荒。这是个大事，咱们要响应上级号召，加紧春耕，快点干起来！今年边区的灾荒是很严重的，全区大概有七分之一的同胞受灾，各级政府虽都想了不少办法，可是灾荒地方太大了，必须咱老百姓大伙想办法一齐动手才行。另外前方的胜利也在不断的扩大，也需要咱多多增产粮食，争取彻底胜利。咱们也要象前方战士打胜仗那股劲来生产才对。现在咱边区有些地方正进行抽补，有些还没进行，已分了地的要不好好生产，分上也是白搭；没分的，也不要三心二意的怕这怕那；边府布告谁种谁收，现在一切都要按政策办事，任何人也不能胡干，不用耽心！安心生产吧！
