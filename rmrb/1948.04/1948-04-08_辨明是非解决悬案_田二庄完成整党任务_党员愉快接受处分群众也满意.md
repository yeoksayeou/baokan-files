　　[Our Newspaper's News] The democratic party rectification in Tian'erzhuang, Ninth District of Wu'an, has victoriously concluded, and the relationship between the masses and party members has reached genuine unity. Following the previous branch meeting of democratic discussion to resolve misunderstandings (see this newspaper on March 17), the Farmers' Association continued supplementary work while the branch concluded the party rectification work. On the evening of March 29th, all party members and all members of the Farmers' Association held a final meeting to distinguish right from wrong, resolve misunderstandings, and settle outstanding issues. Yang Zizhen, the former village head and party member, said: At the last meeting, I confessed to embezzling five dou of wheat, which I didn't actually eat. At the time, I always felt sorry for the masses, and I accepted whatever the masses suggested, with the mentality of "getting through the ordeal," leaving a small misunderstanding. I'm not "going back on my words" now (meaning changing his mind), but I want to resolve this small misunderstanding. After thinking for a moment, he added: I confessed to "undemocratically" buying fifty trees, but in reality, only the first batch of nineteen trees was bought "undemocratically." Last time I said I would compensate five hundred jin of millet because I felt there were too many mistakes. The masses calculated according to the installments (there were eight installments of tree distribution in the past) and said: It's right to clarify things; we can't wrong people. Old party member Yang Qingde was retaliated against during the famine years by a fellow party member who falsely accused him of being a thief, insisting that he had taken bribes from landlord Yang Jingxiang, embezzled sixty jin of rice, was punished, and even received a disciplinary warning with three months of probation within the Party. During this party rectification, after listening to the comrades from the work team telling them to reflect on the "big issues," he also admitted to this false accusation. The other day, this matter was clarified within the branch, and a report was made to the higher authorities to revoke his punishment. At the meeting, he clarified the rights and wrongs again, and the masses and other party members said: That was all done by Zhang Jujin (a party member who was the village head at the time, criticized for corruption and opposed Yang Qingde); it was not true. ... One by one, the problems were clarified, one by one, the misunderstandings were resolved, and everyone was calm, speaking practically and resolving misunderstandings, just like a family. At this time, Yang Yunfeng, the former political director (an old middle peasant), stated that the fruit account from the year before last was indeed lost, and admitted this major mistake, voluntarily accepting punishment and offering three dou of wheat, two shi of grain, one shi and five dou of corn, one hundred jin of cotton seeds, and ten thousand yuan. Duan Kuishan, the former public security officer and party member, voluntarily offered one shi of grain, a vat, and a table as compensation for injuring Meng Quezi. After the two of them finished speaking, it was as if a large stone had been thrown into a calm pool of water, causing a great wave. The meeting hall erupted in a clamor, especially regarding the issue of accounting. Someone on the east side said: How can the account be lost? Someone on the west side said: How can we do without an account? Originally, this issue had been left "unresolved" when Yang Yunfeng made his self-criticism. After the Farmers' Association was re-elected, Yang handed over the account, but only the fruit account from last year's land reform was available; the account from the year before last could not be found. The masses and the members of the Farmers' Association were all suspicious: "There must be an account; he's afraid of not being able to explain things clearly, so he hid the account." "What about the cash?" "There were so many good things confiscated! We haven't seen them distributed to anyone." In short: "We must have the account." The members of the Farmers' Association spent two or three days trying to figure out last year's account, but they couldn't figure it out, and they couldn't find anything, so they were both anxious and discouraged. The account from the year before last was found in part, and after calculating it, it was about right, and the anger gradually subsided, but the masses were still suspicious. The work could not be delayed, so they put aside the accounting and carried out supplementary work. In the supplementary work, the party members showed positive work performance, further gaining the understanding of the masses. After the land adjustment, the party rectification was concluded, the floating wealth was distributed, and the outstanding issues were resolved. At this meeting, the issue of accounting was raised again. First, Yang Yunfeng admitted his mistake and "voluntarily" offered things, requesting punishment. The members of the Farmers' Association divided into three groups to discuss. At first, all that could be heard was loud shouting from each group, "The account can't be lost," "Take it out, it's nothing." Later, the voices gradually subsided, and Yang Suishan, a member of the Farmers' Association, said in one group: "It's impossible to settle it clearly; farmers can't write accounts like merchants (Yunfeng is illiterate)." The opinions gradually became unified. "The punishment is not right; even if he volunteers, it can't be too much." In another group, a new middle peasant, Yang Xiangzi, insisted on having the account. The comrades of the work team asked Xiangzi: "What do you want the account for?" Xiangzi replied: "To settle the account." Asked, "What do you want to settle the account for?" Answer: "To find out how much fruit there is." Asked, "There is an account last year, has it been settled?" "No." Asked, "What to do?" Everyone quarrelled. Finally, the unanimous opinion was: "First, if there is an account, take out the account; second, if there is no account, 'volunteer,' but it can't be too much, and it can't be like dealing with landlords, because he still led the masses to turn over." The opinion of the third group was the same as the first two groups. After the committee announced the opinions of the three groups, Yang Yunfeng said: "If the account is found later, I am willing to be punished by law. I am willing to volunteer those things I just acknowledged." The masses then divided into groups for discussion, and the committee carefully studied the opinions of everyone, based on the spirit of family-style transformation and education, and decided: We don't want the wheat; let him eat it himself. Seven dou of grain, seventy jin of cotton seeds, five dou of corn, and five thousand yuan. At this time, Yang Yunfeng asked to say a few more words. After the chairman allowed it, he said happily and solemnly: "I made a mistake, and I was very painful. Now the masses forgive me. I have no way to repay the kindness of the masses. Just look at my future work." As for Duan Kuishan, it was decided: Take five dou of grain and give it to Meng Quezi (the injured person) as medical expenses, and leave behind the vat and table that he volunteered. After this matter was resolved, the masses said: "The work has a way now." Because if this last knot is not untied, the work of distributing the fruit will not be easy to carry out smoothly. Regarding the solution of the accounting problem, we feel that there must be two conditions: First, let the masses go and calculate by themselves, and only after they have experience will they be willing to change their minds and accept the suggestions of the leadership. At the beginning, we prematurely suggested to them that there was no need to force the account, and some people said: "The cadres are shielding the landlords, and you are shielding the cadres." Second, after the party members have reflected better, and the relationship between the party and the masses has undergone a basic change, this unsolvable but necessary problem can be resolved satisfactorily.
    The next day, the branch invited members of the Farmers' Association and twenty representatives to discuss the punishment of party members who had made mistakes. Unexpectedly, the masses' opinions on the punishment of public security officer Duan Kuishan and preferential treatment director Yang Eryou. Duan Kuishan's work style was very bad, and he liked to use force, and he had injured two women. The masses said that he was "feared by everyone." Yang Eryou became a cadre after the bankruptcy of a rich peasant, and within two years he rose to become a new middle peasant. He joined the Party because the branch secretary pulled him in due to family "clan" relations. He didn't like to work. During the land reform, he embezzled and cheaply bought more than thirty pieces of fruit. After the houses were distributed, he drove people out and forcibly occupied them himself. When the masses were asked for their opinions on the punishment of party members after the last self-criticism of party members, the unanimous opinion of the masses was to "expel them from the Party." And this time, the unanimous opinion of the three groups was: "Duan Kuishan's mistake was for work, his style was bad, and he went too far, but at that time, it was inevitable that public security officers would use force, and he was stronger than Eryouzi. Eryouzi is selfish and only looks for profit, not for work." The opinions of the three groups on Duan Kuishan's punishment were: probation within the Party for two months, three months, and four months. Yang Eryou, probation within the Party for three months, five months, and one year." In addition, regarding the punishment of former village head Yang Zizhen, the masses said: He has a good reputation on the street and is kind to the masses, but after the promulgation of the Land Law, he disobeyed the orders of his superiors and sold the sheep of the Farmers' Association without authorization. Probation within the Party for two months or three months. For those with minor mistakes, they all said: "Just consider it settled if they admit it." "A few words of criticism are enough." On the third day, with the approval of the superior party, Yang Eryou was placed on probation within the Party for one year, Duan Kuishan for four months, and political director Yang Yunfeng, who was the leader of sectarianism and undemocratic within the Party, some party members dared not say a word. This caused internal conflicts among the masses and attacked the poor peasants. Probation within the Party for six months. Yang Zizhen was given a public warning, and two others were given warning punishments for creating internal disputes among the peasants. The other seven party members (a total of thirteen party members) were not punished. The superior authorities also approved Yang Yunfeng and Duan Kuishan's "volunteering" things to the masses in order to educate the party members and the masses, and thus further improve the relationship between the party and the masses. At the plenary meeting of the Farmers' Association, the superior party's punishment of party members was announced, and after the meeting, almost every party member happily said, "Let's look at the work in the future." The masses said with satisfaction: "The Communist Party's methods are really good. They (the party members) have also changed, and our misunderstandings have also been resolved."

　　辨明是非解决悬案
  　田二庄完成整党任务
    党员愉快接受处分群众也满意
    【本报消息】武安九区田二庄民主整党已胜利结束，群众与党员的关系，达到真正团结。该村继上次民主讲理解疙瘩的支部大会之后（见三月十七日本报）。农会一方面进行抽补工作，一方面与支部结束整党工作。三月二十九日晚，全体党员与农会全体会员，最后一次的举行了辨是非、解疙瘩，解决悬案问题的大会。旧村长党员杨子真说：上次会上我反省贪污了五斗麦子，我真没吃。当时我总觉着对不起群众，群众提啥我接受啥，有“过关”思想，挽了个小疙瘩，我现在不是“来回说话”（反复之意），是想解这个小疙瘩。想了想他又说：我反省“不民主”买了五十棵树，实际上只有第一期十九棵树是“不民主”买的。我上回说赔五百斤小米，是觉着错误太多。群众按期（过去分树有八期）算了算说：弄清了就对了，不能冤枉人。老党员杨清德灾荒年被党内同志报复，给他按贼，硬说他受了地主杨景祥的贿赂，贪污了六十斤米，受了罚，还受了留党察看三个月的处分。这次整党中，他听了工作组的同志要他们反省“大的”之后，他又把这个假事承认了，前天在支部里将此事弄清，报告上级撤销他的处分，大会上他又辨明了是非，群众与别的党员说：那都是张聚金（党员，是当时的村长，因腐化受批评，反对杨清德）干的，没的事。………一个个问题弄清了，一个个疙瘩解开了，人人心平气和，讲实际、解疙瘩，真象一家人一样。这时，前政治主任杨云峰（老中农）说到前年果实帐确实丢失了，并承认了这个大错误，自愿受罚，拿出麦子三斗，谷子二石，玉茭一石五斗，籽花一百斤，款子十万元。前公安员党员段魁山因打伤孟缺子，自愿拿出谷子一石，缸一个，桌子一个作为赔偿。他俩说完后，好似一块大石头，投到平静的水池子里，掀了很大的波浪，顿时间会场里嚷嚷成一团，特别对于算帐问题，东边一句：帐还能丢了？西边一句：没帐能行？原来在杨云峰反省时就把这个问题“悬案”了。在农会改选后，杨办交代，只有去年的土改果实帐，前年帐找不到了。群众与农会委员都在怀疑：“一定有帐，他怕交代不清，把帐藏了”。“现洋呢”？“没收的好东西多着呢！没见分给谁了”。总而言之：“非要帐不行”。农会委员把去年的帐算了两三天算不清，也算不出啥来，又着急又泄气，前年的帐找到了一部分，算了算差不多，气渐渐消了，但是群众还在怀疑。工作不能拖着，放下算帐进行抽补，在抽补工作中，党员又表现工作积极，更取得群众的谅解。土地调剂之后，结束整党，分配浮财，解决悬案问题，这次大会上，再次提出算帐的事。首先，杨云峰承认错误，并“自动”东西，请求处分。农会会员分三组进行讨论。开始，只听到各组大声嚷，“帐能丢了”，“拿出来没事”。以后声音逐渐小下去，农会委员杨随山在一个小组里说：“清结不了糊涂了，庄稼人，帐目那能象买卖人写的一样？（云峰不认字）”大家意见逐渐统一起来。“处罚不对，自动点也不能太多”。另一组有个新中农杨祥子却非要帐不可。工作组的同志问祥子；“要帐为了啥”？祥子答：“为了算帐”。问“算帐为了啥”？答：“为了弄清果实有多少”？问“去年有帐，算清了没有”？“没有”。问“怎么办”？大家咯吵起来，最后一致意见是：“一、有帐拿帐；二、无帐‘自动’，也不能太多了，不能象对地主一样，因他还领导着群众翻了身”。第三组的意见与上两组相同。委员会把三组意见宣布后，杨云峰说：“以后搜出帐来，请愿受法律制裁。我愿自动刚才我认的那些东西”。群众再分组讨论，委员会集中大家意见慎重研究，本着一家人改造教育的精神，议决：麦子不要，叫他自己吃吧。谷子要七斗，籽花七十斤，玉茭五斗、款五万元。这时杨云峰要求再说两句话，主席允许后，他愉快而郑重的说：“我犯了错误，非常痛苦，现在群众原谅我，我无法报群众的恩情，看以后的工作吧”。对于段魁山则议决：拿五斗谷子给孟缺子（被打伤者）作为养伤费，再留下他自动的一个缸，一个棹子。这事解决之后，群众说：“工作可有了路了”。因为不解开最后这个疙瘩，分配果实的工作是不容易顺利进行的。关于解决算帐问题，我们感到必须有两个条件，一、放手让群众自己去算，有了体验，他才肯转弯子，接受领导上的建议。开始我们过早的建议他们，不必强算帐，个别人说：“干部包庇地主，你们包庇干部。”二、党员反省较好，党群关系有了基本转变之后，这个不可解决而又必须解决的问题才能得到圆满的结果。
    第二天，支部请农会委员与二十个代表，讨论犯错误的党员的处分问题。出乎工作组意料之外的，是群众对公安员段魁山与优抗主任扬二友的处分意见。段魁山工作作风很坏，好动态度，打伤过两个妇女，群众说他是“人人怕”。杨二友是富农破产后当了干部，二年之内上升为新中农的，入党是支部书记因本家“宗派”关系拉进来的，不好劳动。土改中贪污贱买果实三十余件。分配好了房子，他把人家赶出去，自己强占了。上次党员反省后征求群众对党员处分的意见时，群众一致的意见是将他二人“开除党籍”。而这次三个小组约而同的意见是：“段魁山的错误是为了工作，作风赖，过了火，那时候当公安员的免不了动态度，比二友子强。二友子是自私自利，见利就钻，不是为了工作”。三个组对段魁山的处分意见是：留党察看二个月、三个月、四个月。杨二友，留党察看三个月、五个月、一年”。此外，对于旧村长杨子真的处分，群众说：他在街上威信不错，对群众心肝眼好，就是土地法颁布后，违抗上级命令，私自把农会的羊卖了。留党察看两个月或三个月。对于错误小的都说：“承认了就算了”。“批评两句就算了”。第三天经上级党批准，杨二友留党察看一年，段魁山四个月，政治主任杨云峰以他为首闹宗派，党内不民主，一部分党员不敢哼气。党外引起群众内部的矛盾，打击贫农。留党察看六个月。杨子真当众警告，还有两个因制造农民内部纠纷受警告处分。其他七个党员（共十三个党员）未给处分。对于杨云峰与段魁山向群众“自动”东西，以达到教育党员与群众，并因此而更加改善了党与群众的关系，上级也予批准。在农会全体会上宣布了上级党对于党员的处分，会后几乎每个党员都愉快的说，“以后看工作吧”。群众满意的说：“共产党的法子真好，他们（党员）也改了，咱的疙瘩也解了”。
