Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Athens Dispatch: The Greek Democratic Army has repeatedly defeated the Greek puppet government's full-scale offensive in central Macedonia and the Epirus region, and launched a full-scale general counter-offensive in Epirus. According to a compilation of TASS news and the Greek Democratic Army's battle report of the 8th: After the previous offensive launched by the puppet government forces in Epirus failed, under the blood transfusion and direct command of U.S. imperialism, it launched a full-scale offensive on the vast front of Epirus on March 28. The enemy forces invested in this line included three infantry brigades, namely the 56th, 31st, and 33rd, several assault detachments, and an air force detachment. At the same time, the enemy's Third Army Corps launched an offensive in central and eastern Macedonia on March 30. The troops invested by the Athens puppet government in this "Spring Offensive" exceeded the records of all previous offensives in the past two years, but to no avail. The Democratic Army has victoriously defeated the enemy's offensive in the Kutia and Kerdilia areas of central Macedonia on March 30, and continues to directly threaten Thessaloniki, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. At the same time, after nine days of fierce fighting on the Epirus battlefield, the Democratic Army repelled the enemy's offensive and launched a full-scale general counter-offensive on the 5th of this month, defeating six enemy infantry battalions. In the nine days of fighting before the counter-offensive alone, 700 enemies were killed or wounded, and the enemy forces have now fled back to their original positions in a panic.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Free Greece Radio broadcast on the 10th: The Greek Democratic Army continues to launch successful attacks in central Greece and the Morea Peninsula. On the 5th, the Democratic Army attacked the royalist fascist base near Karditsa in the Trikala district of central Greece, eliminating the enemy's 742nd Battalion, capturing 46 enemy officers and soldiers including the enemy staff officer, and seizing a large number of military supplies and spoils of war. Seventy villagers in the area enthusiastically joined the army. At the same time, the Democratic Army captured the Farsala airfield (in the Larissa district of central and eastern Greece), won over 17 airfield ground service personnel to join the army, and destroyed all military materials at the airfield. On the 3rd and 4th, the Democratic Army also liberated many villages in eastern Macedonia and Thrace. A few days ago, King Paul of Greece and the head of the U.S. military mission to Greece, Follett, traveled by train to the Morea Peninsula. The leading escort train was blown up by guerrillas en route, and four royalist guards were killed. These two top public enemies of the Greek people were frightened and hurriedly shrank back to Naviplion (a seaport in eastern Morea), changing their "travel" to the sea route.

    【新华社陕北十二日电】雅典讯：希民主军连日在马其顿中部和爱匹鲁斯地区击溃希伪政府军的全面攻势，并在爱匹鲁斯展开全线总反攻。综合塔斯社消息及希民主军八日战报：伪政府军前次在爱匹鲁斯发动攻势失败后，在美帝输血与直接指挥下，复于三月二十八日在爱匹鲁斯广阔战线上发动全面攻势。投入该线的敌军有五十六、三十一及三十三等三个步兵旅，几个突击支队及一支空军小队。同时，敌军第三军团则于三月三十日起在马其顿中部和东部发动攻势。雅典伪政府投入这次“春季大攻势”中的部队，超过两年来历次的纪录，然而仍无济于事。民主军已胜利地击败了敌军三月三十日在马其顿中部库提亚与克尔地利亚地带的进攻，并继续直接威逼萨罗尼加，敌死伤惨重。同时民主军在爱匹鲁斯战场经九天激战击退敌人进攻后，已于本月五日展开了全线总反攻，击溃敌六个步兵营。仅反攻前九天战斗中，就毙伤敌七百人，现敌军已狼狈逃回原阵地。
