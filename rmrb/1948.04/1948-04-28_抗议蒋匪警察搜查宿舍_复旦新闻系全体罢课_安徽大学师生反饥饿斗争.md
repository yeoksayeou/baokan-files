    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: According to Shanghai news: More than 300 students in the Journalism Department of Fudan University (total students in the school are 3,000), have been on a general strike since the 23rd to protest the Chiang bandit police's intrusion into the school and search of dormitories. "The strike is likely to spread to the entire school" (Associated Press). Another report: During the spring break, students from Shanghai's Fudan, Jinan and other universities were invited by Zhejiang University students to visit Hangzhou and pay respects at the tomb of martyr Yu Zisan, a Zhejiang University student who died at the end of last year. More than 100 Jinan University students were beaten by Chiang bandit secret agent "students" on the 8th after returning to school on the 6th of this month from Hangzhou, with eight students injured by the bandits. On the 9th, when the students who went to Hangzhou negotiated with the school's training department, the gang of bandits broke in and assaulted them again. It is reported that this group of secret agent "students" is led by Dan Jiarui, the Chiang bandit secret agent murderer who previously beat Professor Hong Shen at Fudan (when Fudan was in Beibei). Dan is now leading the heinous secret agent work at Jinan University under the guise of a "student." Currently, Jinan University is experiencing a surge of resistance due to the constant creation of disturbances by Chiang's secret agents.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: According to delayed news from Shanghai newspapers: After all the professors of Anhui University in Anqing began an indefinite suspension of teaching last month, all the students of the school have also joined the anti-hunger struggle, electing four representatives to go to Nanjing to petition. On the 30th of last month, four student representatives went to the Chiang bandit Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to petition, putting forward three demands: "Bring our professors back to the classroom," "Our public funds should be increased in proportion to the professors' treatment," and "Distribute supplies according to the actual situation." However, the petition yielded no results, and the Chiang bandit government has rejected the students' demands.
