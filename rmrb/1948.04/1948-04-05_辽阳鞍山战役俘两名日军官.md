Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd: A unit of the People's Liberation Army recently discovered two Japanese officers among the captured Chiang Kai-shek army officers in the Liaoyang-Anshan campaign. One is Kazuo Yamada, now renamed Geng Yuan, 35 years old, from Fukuoka City, Japan. He was originally a private first class in the Japanese Kwantung Army. He came to the Northeast in 1932. After the "July 7th" Incident, he served as a stationmaster for armored trains of the Japanese invaders in Beiping, Xuzhou and other places. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, he was recruited by Chiang Kai-shek's army and served as a machine gun shooter in the mountain artillery battalion of the 52nd Army. The other is Kazuyuki Maeda, now renamed Chen Dehao, 25 years old, from Kochi Prefecture, Japan. He was originally a student at the Japanese Kwantung Army Officer Academy. In March 1946, he was recruited by Chiang Kai-shek's 52nd Army in Fushun and served as a lower-ranking observer in the mountain artillery battalion. According to their confessions, many Japanese officers are serving as gunners, machine gunners, and communication personnel in the directly subordinate communications company and other units of Chiang Kai-shek's 52nd Army. Both Kazuo Yamada and Kazuyuki Maeda participated in the past battles of Liaoyang, Haicheng, Anshan, and Benxi. This is yet another ironclad proof of Chiang Kai-shek's use of Japanese invaders to slaughter the Chinese people.
