　　【Taihang News】The Taihang Sixth Branch of the Jinnan Bank of Hebei Province convened a meeting of managers from various county branches on March 20th to study and improve the work of issuing spring production loans. First, it was found upon inspection that last year's loan policy emphasized combining private capital and mechanically stipulated uses and deadlines, which restricted loans to poor and hired peasants, resulting in serious phenomena such as cadres taking up too many loans and cooperatives misappropriating loans. Since last winter, there has been an emphasis on lending to poor and hired peasants, rejecting loans to middle peasants, and forcing the recovery of loans from middle peasants, creating antagonism between poor and hired peasants and middle peasants in terms of loans. These left-leaning and right-leaning tendencies must be corrected. The discussion corrected the one-sided so-called class line of thought. It was recognized that the purpose of loans is to help the masses develop production and solve the capital difficulties of the masses in production; the loan recipients are mainly poor and hired peasants, but loans must also be given to middle peasants and rural handicraft workers who have production difficulties. When studying how to organize the issuance of loans, many problems arising from the past reliance on village cadres and cooperatives for issuance were examined. This year's loans should be managed and distributed through peasant representative conferences or peasant associations in villages where democracy and rectification have been carried out; in villages where democracy and rectification have not been carried out, they should be managed and distributed through production committees, etc.

　　太行六分行研究改进春贷工作
    【太行消息】冀南银行太行第六分行，于三月二十日，召集各县支行经理开会，研究与改进发放春季生产贷款工作。首先检查出在贷款政策上，去年曾强调了结合私资，机械的规定用途和期限，结果限制了贫雇贷款，而发生干部多占贷款，合作社挪用贷款的严重现象；自去冬以来，又强调贷给贫雇，拒绝中农贷款，强迫收回中农的贷款，使贫雇中农在贷款上对立起来，这种偏左偏右的倾向，都必须纠正。讨论中纠正了片面的所谓阶级路线思想。认识贷款的目的，是在帮助群众发展生产，解决群众生产中的资本困难；贷款对象，主要是贷给贫雇农民，同时也必须贷给生产有困难的中农及乡村手工业工人。研究如何组织发放时，检查了过去单纯的依靠村干部与合作社发放而产生的许多毛病。今年的贷款，在进行民主、填补的村，要一律通过农代会或农会掌握发放；在没有进行民主填补的村，要经过生产委员会等管理发放。
