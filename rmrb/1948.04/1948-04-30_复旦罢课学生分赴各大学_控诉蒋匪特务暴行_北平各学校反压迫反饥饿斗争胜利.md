Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 28th: According to news from Shanghai on the 26th, after the entire student body of the Journalism Department of Fudan University held an anti-oppression strike on the 23rd, it has gained the support of students from other departments of the school. On that day, one-quarter of the students participated in the strike, and the number continued to increase afterward. On the 26th, students from various departments decided to hold a representative assembly to discuss the issue of a general strike. Another report: After the strike began, Fudan Journalism students formed more than a dozen accusation teams, each with more than ten people, to go to various universities to accuse Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents of atrocities and call on students from various schools to support them with action. The cause of the Fudan student movement was that Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents infringed on the personal freedom of Mr. Yang, a student of the Journalism Department, on the street and conducted a rough search. In addition, Chiang's secret agents broke into Fudan and searched the dormitories extensively.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 27th: According to foreign press reports: Because the Beiping Chiang Kai-shek bandit garrison headquarters dispatched Chiang's bandit secret agents to arrest students of the Teachers College on April 9th, under the pressure of unanimous criticism from public opinion and the vigorous protest struggle of the education community, they were forced to formally issue a written apology to the school and promised to compensate for all losses caused by the atrocities of the secret agents. The Teachers College students have decided to resume classes victoriously on the 26th, and the remaining schools in Peiping and Tianjin have also resumed classes one after another. This anti-oppression and anti-hunger student movement in Peiping and Tianjin began on March 29th and lasted for four weeks. In addition to the 14 universities in Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan Institute of Technology that have been previously reported, the participants in the struggle also included Chinese University in Peiping (participated in the April 9th demonstration) and the Nursing School affiliated with the Peking University Medical College (participated in the anti-oppression strike), totaling 17 universities. In addition, the Peking University Affiliated Hospital participated in the anti-oppression student movement by holding a strike. The students of Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan demonstrated a revolutionary spirit in this movement, exposed and struck at Chiang Kai-shek's despicable and shameless secret agent policy, reviewed their own strength, and achieved great victory.

    复旦罢课学生分赴各大学
    控诉蒋匪特务暴行
    北平各学校反压迫反饥饿斗争胜利
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据上海二十六日消息：复旦大学新闻系全体学生二十三日起举行反压迫罢课后，已获得该校其他各系科学生支持，当天即有四分之一学生参加罢课，以后续有增加，二十六日各系科学生决定召开代表大会，讨论总罢课问题。另息：复旦新闻系学生于罢课开始后已组成控诉队十数队，每队十余人，前往各大学控诉蒋匪特务暴行，呼吁各校学生以行动支持。按复旦学潮起因，系由于蒋匪特务曾在街上侵害该校新闻系学生杨君之人身自由，横施搜查；另有蒋特闯入复旦，大肆搜查宿舍。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据外国通讯社报导：由于北平蒋匪警备司令部对四月九日派遣蒋特匪徒逮捕师院入学生事，已在社会舆论一致抨击，与教育界奋起抗议斗争的压力下，被迫向该校正式提出书面道歉，并答应赔偿因特务暴行所引起之一切损失，师院学生已决定于二十六日胜利复课，平津其余学校业已先后复课。此次平津反压迫反饥饿学潮开始于三月二十九日。延续四周之久。卷入斗争者，除前已报导之平、津十四院校及唐山工学院外，尚有北平中华大学（参加四月九日示威）、北大医学院附设之护士学校（参加反压迫罢课）、共达十七个院校，另有北大附属医院参加反压迫学潮举行罢工。平、津、唐学生在这次运动中，表现了革命的气概，揭露并打击了蒋匪卑鄙无耻的特务政策，并检阅了自己的力量，获得了很大的胜利。
