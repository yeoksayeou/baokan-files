　　Yangcheng Nanciying and Other Villages
  　Correct Errors of Infringing Upon Middle Peasants; Cancel Supervision and Return Shares
    [Yangcheng News] Nanciying Village resolutely cancelled the erroneous supervision of middle peasants, returned the middle peasants' shares, eliminated the middle peasants' anxieties, and the whole village worked together on farming. Last year, Nanciying did several things that harmed the interests of middle peasants: 1. The cooperative used the shares of middle peasants; 2. Twenty middle-peasant households were placed under supervision; 3. Middle peasant members were purged from the peasant association. In addition, news of struggling against middle peasants from other villages caused panic among middle peasants, who doubted the policies. Middle peasant Li Shuying originally planned to buy three mu of land and an ox, but his class status was raised, and he was purged from the peasant association and the militia. They even said they would redistribute his property, scaring him so much that he lost interest in labor. However, fearing that others would criticize his thinking, he worked half-heartedly. In the past, he applied more than 35 loads of manure per mu of land, but this time he only applied 26 or 27 loads. The village cadres, because of their own work style and excessive gains, were afraid of being criticized in the democratic movement. Therefore, the district cadres hired poor peasants and cadres to discuss the middle peasant policy. On the afternoon of the 13th, a village-wide peasant meeting was held to announce the policies toward middle peasants, especially the public announcement of the cancellation of the supervision of twenty middle peasant households. Their previously paid shares in the cooperative were returned, and the purged middle peasant members were reinstated. They also promoted the principles of democratic and equal exchange in mutual aid. After this meeting, the mood of the peasants in the whole village immediately changed. The middle peasants in particular were very satisfied, saying: "We can see the light of day now, Chairman Mao's policies have come to our village." Old man Fengtang, because his worries were gone, said to his wife: "My heart is lighter, give me a good meal." In addition, the difficulties of hiring poor peasants were also studied and resolved. Forty-two mu of public land and eighteen shi of grain in the village were distributed to poor and hired peasants who had little land and lacked food and drink, so the mood of the poor and hired peasants was also very high. From then on, all the peasants of Nanciying had a high enthusiasm for production. Manure has now been completely applied, with 24 loads of manure per mu. 170 mu of flax have been planted, 65 mu of cotton, and 38 mu of hemp and sesame. Women have spun 730 jin of cotton and woven 312 bolts of cloth, and 35 silkworm raising groups have been organized.
    [Qinyuan News] Beiyuan Village was controlled by a "Poor Peasants' Group" manipulated by a few bad cadres. The condition for participation was that anyone with good thoughts could join, regardless of their class status. During the thought reform in the winter of last year, many middle peasants were turned into "struggle targets," and the doors of seven middle peasant households were sealed. As a result, all the middle peasants in the village immediately became uneasy and stopped working and producing. Old middle peasant Li Qingzhi slaughtered more than 20 jin of meat to invite the village cadres to dinner during the New Year. New middle peasant Tang Wenquan said dissatisfiedly: "I don't know how many enemies will be created by doing things this way!" But the village cadres of the "Poor Peasants' Group" would not listen to these words and continued to mess around. Now that spring plowing is coming, there is no firewood, no charcoal, and no manure. It was not until March 20 that the district cadres returned from the enlarged cadre meeting of the prefectural committee and resolutely cancelled the supervision of the middle peasants. The work team went to Beiyuan to publicize the middle peasant policy and especially publicized the criteria for class division. Only then did the middle peasants realize: "As long as you work yourself and don't exploit others, you don't have to be afraid of struggle, and your heart will be at ease." The next day, middle peasant Song Guochang went to plow the fields. The twenty middle peasant households in Sanlv, because they did not work last year, suffered from famine and hurried to chop firewood to sell for money, and some made small businesses to earn some grain for food and drink during spring plowing.
    Editor's note: Who is supporting the village cadres in this village who are acting recklessly? After the work team went down, it only cancelled the supervision of the middle peasants. How have the bad cadres been dealt with? Their mistakes must be acknowledged and corrected and not easily let go.

　　阳城南次营等村
  　纠正侵犯中农错误　取消管制退还股金
    【阳城消息】南次营村，坚决取消对中农的错误管制，退还中农股金，消除中农心病，全村齐心闹庄稼。年时南次营作了几桩伤害中农利益的事情：一、在合作社抽用了中农的股金，二、管制起二十户中农，三、农会清洗了中农成份的会员。加上从别村传来斗中农的消息，闹得中农恐慌不安，怀疑政策。中农李树英，原来计划添买三亩地一个牛，可是被提高了成份，又被从农会、民兵里清出来，还说要打乱平分，吓得再没心思劳动；但是又怕人家追自己思想，马马虎虎劳动。往年他地每亩上粪三十五担以上，这回只上粪二十六七担。村干部也因自己的作风和多得果实，怕在民主运动中吃家伙。据此区干领导雇贫农和干部，讨论了中农政策，又在十三日下午召开全村农民大会，宣布对中农的政策，特别是当众宣布取消对二十户中农的管制，归还了他前在合作社的股金，恢复了被清洗的中农会员，更宣传了互助中的民主等价交换等原则，经过这次会议，全村农民情绪马上有了转变，尤其中农很满意的说：“咱可见天了，毛主席的政策来咱村了。”风堂老汉因为去了心病，他给女人说：“我心轻了，给我吃一顿好饭。”另外对雇贫农困难也研究解决，将村里公地四十二亩，粮食十八石，分给了少地和缺乏吃喝的贫雇农，所以贫雇情绪也很高。从此南次营全体农民生产的劲很高，现已将粪送完，每亩地上粪二十四担。种麻一百七十亩，种棉花六十五亩，及大麻芝麻三十八亩。妇女纺花七百三十斤，织布三百十二个，又组织了三十五个喂蚕组。
    【沁源消息】北园村为少数坏干部把持的“贫农团”，参加的条件是不论成份只要思想好。在年时冬天追思想中，就把不少中农追成了“斗争对象”，封了七户中农的门，因此全村中农马上不安心起来，也不劳动生产了。老中农李清之过年割了廿多斤肉请村干部吃饭，新中农唐文全不满说：“这样弄法不知要弄出多少敌人来！”可是村干部“贫农团”哪会听进这些话，还是胡搞。现在要春耕了，柴没柴，炭没炭，粪没粪，直到三月二十日，区干部从地委扩大干部会回来后，坚决取消了对中农的管制，工作团又去北园宣传了中农政策，特别把划阶级标准宣传了一下，中农才认识了：“只要自己劳动不剥削人就不怕斗争，心也安下来了”。第二天中农宋国昌去刨地了，三闾的二十户中农，因为去年没劳动，拉下了饥荒，赶紧打柴卖钱，有的作小买卖赚下一些粮食，好在春耕中吃喝。
    编者按：该村干部，胡作非为，是谁给他们撑的腰？工作团下去后，只取消了中农的管制，对于坏干部没见怎样处理？他们的错误必须承认改正，不容轻易放过。
