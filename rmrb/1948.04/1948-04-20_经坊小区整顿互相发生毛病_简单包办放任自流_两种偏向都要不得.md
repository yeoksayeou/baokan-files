　　【This Newspaper's News】Twenty-six village cadres from Jingfang Township, District Three, Changzhi, held a meeting on April 8th to review production and identified the shortcomings of their work. The primary issue was insufficient policy promotion. For instance, after the border government's proclamation was publicized, a middle peasant in Dongmiao Village said, "Don't worry! We're not afraid this year." The masses in Liling Village said, "This year, the higher authorities guarantee that whoever plants will reap." Superficially, everyone appears to be mobilized, but in reality, this reflects a single-season mindset; they are still waiting, if not for this year, then for next. Consequently, they don't intend to improve the land, simply planting and harvesting. In Dongmiao Village, there's a saying: "The autumn fields were all turned over last year, so this year, just give it a quick once over and plant. It should grow for a year." This lack of long-term planning requires deeper and more sustained mobilization. Furthermore, the principle of voluntarism was not correctly grasped during the rectification of mutual aid teams. Two tendencies were observed during rectification: one was simply emphasizing voluntarism and abandoning leadership. For example, during rectification in Liling Village, the village cadres said, "This year, mutual aid must be truly voluntary. Whoever wants to participate in mutual aid can, and whoever doesn't want to can quit (meaning, forget it)." As a result, many problems from last year remained unresolved. Thus, forty-four households were unwilling to continue mutual aid (out of a total of two hundred and forty-seven households in the village; all had participated in mutual aid last year). One group, originally consisting of seven households, all chose not to participate in mutual aid out of "voluntarism." When asked why, the response was, "We all voluntarily don't want to participate in mutual aid." The village cadres felt helpless at this point. The political director of Jingfang Township said, "We shouldn't have mentioned voluntarism; it's ruined things" (it's not voluntarism that's the problem, but rather that there was coercion in the past; true voluntarism wasn't achieved—Editor). The other tendency was to only mention rectification and not dare to mention voluntarism. For example, in Donghan Village, which has more than seventy households scattered far apart, the cadres feared that mentioning voluntarism would make it impossible to reorganize. Therefore, after rectification, the five groups remained unchanged. Everyone said, "Let's do mutual aid; no objections!" The rectification merely involved a verbal declaration, and in practice, most people were engaged in individual pursuits, with few working in the fields. After review and discussion, it was found that the former approach was to abandon leadership in favor of voluntarism, leading to drift. This was mainly because cadres were afraid to boldly lead and even more afraid to issue administrative orders, but they had no new methods. They simply mentioned voluntary association, allowing everyone to review the problems and shortcomings left over from last year. They didn't mention the role that organization had played in the past and denied the achievements of past organization. As a result, only the negative aspects were highlighted, and the mutual aid teams were criticized mercilessly. Furthermore, due to insufficient education in mutual assistance and the promotion of mutual aid and friendship in the past, cadres were unclear about the significance of rectifying mutual aid. They failed to connect the resolution of emotional and historical problems with the mobilization and development of production. They simply reorganized the groups and changed a few people, so the problems weren't resolved, and everyone was unwilling to participate in mutual aid. The second approach, only mentioning rectification and not voluntarism, is still a kind of old, undemocratic, and forced organization. The result of this approach is still a formalistic, empty shell. People are superficially forced together, but they are actually dissatisfied and labor efficiency remains low. This formalistic approach should be corrected immediately.

　　经坊小区整顿互相发生毛病
    简单包办放任自流  两种偏向都要不得
    【本报消息】长治三区经坊小区村干部二十六人，于四月八号开会，检查生产，检讨出这段工作的缺点，首先是政策宣传不够深入。如宣传了边府布告后，东苗村中农这样说：“不怕！今年是不怕。”黎岭村群众说：“今年有上级保证，谁种一定谁能收。”表面看来，大家都动开了，实际这是收一季的思想，还是等待，不等今年，是等明年。因此对土地不打算加工做造，只是种上收了就算。东苗村有这样的说法：“去年的秋地都垡过啦，今年扑拉扑拉圪＠种上就行，怕不长一年啦。”这种不作长期打算的思想，应作深入不断的发动。再就是整顿互助组，没有正确的掌握自愿原则。在整顿中发现两种偏向：一种是单纯强调自愿，放弃领导。如黎岭村整顿时，村干部说：“今年互助，要真正自觉自愿，谁愿互助就互助，不愿互助就拉倒（算了的意思）。”结果因为去年的遗留问题很多，没有得到解决。这样就有四十四户不愿再互助（全村共二百四十七户，去年都互助）。有一个组，原来七户在一块，一自愿大家都不互助了。问是什么原因，答复是“我们都自愿不互助。”经坊村北街一个青年说：“要自愿我就自愿不互助啦！”村干部这时也感到没办法，经坊政治主任说：“可不该提这自愿来，自愿坏啦”（并不是自愿坏啦，而是过去互助有强迫，没做到真自愿——编者）。另一种是只提整顿，不敢提自愿。如东韩村全村七十多户，住的很散，干部怕提出自愿，就无法再组织。所以整顿后五个组还是原封不动。大家说：“互助吧，没意见！”整顿只是说了句话，实际多是各搞各的，全村大部分是搞副业，下地的人很少。经过检讨研究后，检查出前一种是放弃领导去自愿，因而形成自流。主要是因为干部不敢大胆领导，更不敢再行政命令，但又没新的办法，只是简单提了个自愿结合，让大家检查去年的遗留问题和毛病缺点，对过去组织起来所起的作用不提，否认了过去组织起来的成绩，结果光有坏的一面，把互助组批评了个一塌糊涂。其次，由于过去对组织起来互相拉拔，发扬互助友爱精神的教育不够，干部对为什么要整顿互助的意义不明确，没有把情理遗留问题与发动发展生产结合起来，只简单的编编组，换几个人，结果问题没有得到解决，大家都无心互助了。第二种只提整顿不提自愿的做法，还是一种旧的不民主的强编。这样做法的结果，仍是形式空架子，表面硬互到一块，实际内心不满，劳动效率仍提不高。这种形式主义不放手的做法，应马上纠正。
