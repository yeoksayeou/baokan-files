　　[Xiangyuan News] Xia Liang Town convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders above the level of natural villages and production committee members on March 19. In addition to conveying and discussing the elimination of concerns about disrupting equal distribution, rectification, and the inability to harvest what one planted, it took seven days of preparation and three night school discussions to get the mutual aid teams going. The first night school session was to resolve ideological concerns and encourage voluntary group formation. The consensus was: this year we must be truly voluntary, whether it's a group of three or five, but this would isolate the elderly, widowed, and those without labor. The second night school session reviewed past mutual aid efforts, identified difficulties, and resolved them specifically. Finally, the question was raised: is it right to isolate the poor and those without labor? After discussion, ideas were clarified (Editor's note: if there is no equivalent exchange, the so-called "clarification of ideas" is probably unreliable). The third night school session finally rectified mutual aid, absorbed the poor and those without labor, and many people, after consideration, switched groups, achieving true voluntariness. The whole village organized 50 mutual aid teams, with 316 people, and 33 textile groups, with 302 people.
　　At the second night school session, four difficulties were identified and resolved: First, 26 poor peasant households and 11 middle peasant households were having difficulty making ends meet and had no food to eat. After discussion among the farmers, it was decided to allocate 14.7 shi (石，unit of dry measure) of fruit grain to solve this problem. Second, women were making military shoes, and buying hemp cost 1,100 yuan per jin (斤，unit of weight). To solve this problem, the cooperative pulled back 410 jin of hemp from Changzhi and sold it to the women at the original price of 750 yuan per jin, saving 350 yuan per jin, for a total savings of 143,500 yuan. Third, 15 poor peasant households had difficulty with farm tools and could not afford to buy them. It was decided to return the 60,000 yuan in loans that cadres and activists had previously over-borrowed from the bank, and the cooperative would then withdraw 100,000 yuan in loans to solve the problem. Fourth, there was insufficient animal power. The cooperative's six transport mules and the coal mine's seven water-pulling animals were organized (the cooperative's animals temporarily stopped transportation, and the coal mine's animals were temporarily transferred for use), and farmers with animal power difficulties were allowed to cultivate using equivalent value methods. Now, the entire village's male and female labor force and animal power have been mobilized. (Xiangyuan Joint Office)

　　下良镇经过三次民校讨论
    整顿互助自愿结组解决四项春耕困难
    【襄垣消息】下良镇在三月十九日召开了各自然村互助组长以上干部及生产委员会议，除了经过传达讨论，解除怕打乱平分、怕整党、怕自己种了不能收等顾虑外，前后经过七天酝酿，三次夜校讨论，已把互助组搞起来。第一次夜校是解决思想顾虑，自愿碰组。大家意见是：今年咱要真正自愿，三人一组也好，五人一组也行，但这样就孤立了孤寡无劳力户。第二次夜校检讨过去互助，发现困难问题，具体解决，最后提出了孤立贫苦无劳力户对不对？经过讨论，打通思想（编者按：如果不是等价交换，所谓“打通思想”恐怕是靠不住的。）第三次夜校最后整顿互助，吸收贫苦无劳力户参加，并有不少人，经过考虑跳了组，做到了真正自愿。全村共组织互助组五十个，三百一十六人，纺织组卅三个，三百零二人。
    在第二次夜校上，发现并解决了四个困难问题：第一个是有二十六户贫雇，十一户中农，生活困难，没粮食吃。经过农民讨论，决定拿出果实粮十四石七斗来解决这个问题。第二个是妇女正在做军鞋，买麻每斤得一千一百元，合作社为解决这个问题，往长治拉回麻四百一十斤，按原价每斤七百五十元卖给妇女，每斤便宜三百五十元，共省洋十四万三千五百元。第三个是十五户贫雇农的农具困难，没法买。决定把以前干部和积极分子向银行多贷的六万元款退出来，合作社再抽十万元借款来解决。第四个是畜力不够用，把合作社六头运输骡，和煤窑上七头拉水牲口组织起来（合作社牲口暂时停止运输，煤窑上牲口暂时抽调使用），按等价办法给畜力困难的农民耕种。现在全村男女劳力和畜力已经干起来了。　（襄垣联合办公室）
