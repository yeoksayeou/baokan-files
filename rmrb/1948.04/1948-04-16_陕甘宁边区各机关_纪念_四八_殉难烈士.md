　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Various Organizations
  　Commemorate the Martyrs of the "April 8th" Incident
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 14th] More than 600 cadres from various organizations in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region commemorated the second anniversary of the martyrdom of the "April 8th" martyrs on the 9th. The atmosphere at the meeting was solemn. Ma Mingfang, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, Wang Weizhou, Deputy Commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin Sui Joint Defense Military Region (formerly known as the Northwest Joint Defense Military Region), and Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the Border Region Government, spoke successively. They unanimously called on all cadres to learn from the noble qualities of the martyrs Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, Deng Fa, and Ye Ting, who were loyal and unwavering to the cause of the people's liberation and resolutely implemented the Party's policies, in order to fulfill the unfulfilled wishes of the "April 8th" martyrs. Deputy Secretary Ma pointed out: Over the past two years, the Chinese Communist Party, leading the people and the People's Liberation Army across the country, has given the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which is aiding the U.S. imperialists by feigning peace and undermining peace, the punishment it deserves. In the future, the victorious offensive will continue to unfold vigorously, thoroughly crushing the ruling institutions of the Chiang bandit gang and liberating all of China.
