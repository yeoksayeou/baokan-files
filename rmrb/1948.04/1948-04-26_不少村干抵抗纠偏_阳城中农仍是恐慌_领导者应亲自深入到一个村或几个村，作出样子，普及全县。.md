    Many Village Cadres Resist Correction of Deviations; Middle Peasants in Yangcheng Still Panic
    Leaders Should Personally Go Deep into One or Several Villages to Set an Example and Popularize it Throughout the County.
    [Taiyue News] Regarding the leadership in Yangcheng County, at the end of last month, it was proposed that damaging or squeezing out middle peasants was not allowed, and compensation should be made for those who had already been damaged, and doors that had been sealed should be opened. Although the first district has already investigated the situation and started to make corrections, many village cadres are not resolutely implementing it, resisting it passively, and still refusing to correct their mistakes, so many middle peasants are panicked and uneasy. After the cadres of Xiabaisang returned to the village, they only mentioned it briefly in the winter school and did not explain in detail our policy of not infringing upon the middle peasants. The masses said, "The cadres came back from the meeting in Yue Zhuang (i.e., the county's spring plowing mobilization meeting), and they kept everything to themselves." The ten "struggle targets" under control (seven of whom are middle peasants), although reluctantly had their control lifted, were not allowed to be announced, saying that it would be released later. The cadres of Dongjin Village also did not properly publicize the policy. When the reporter went to Zhang Zhuang, an affiliated village of Dongjin Village, to investigate, many people did not know what kind of meeting the county had held. The Qina family, a middle peasant family, hid grain and had three *shi* (石, a unit of dry volume) confiscated. Now that they have asked for compensation, a group leader said, "I would rather die than return it to him." When Lu Gaixing of the branch committee heard about it, he did not insist on returning it. When Qina, a primary school teacher, read the newspaper to the masses and read the news that middle peasants should not be infringed upon, the "poor and hired peasant group" held a meeting to discuss and criticize him for not reading the newspaper. At this time, someone's cattle ate half a *mu* (亩, a unit of area) of rapeseed belonging to a middle peasant. The primary school teacher said that they should not have eaten it, and the "hired and poor peasants" held another meeting to discuss it, frightening the primary school teacher, and the rapeseed that had been eaten was not compensated either, so the middle peasants were very uneasy. When the reporter arrived at the village, he met a middle peasant who was eating dry rice, and he immediately explained to the reporter, "I only eat dry rice when I am producing in the mutual aid group today." Another middle peasant, after being struggled against, was starving, and his brother, who originally had grain, did not dare to lend it to him. This shows that the panic among the middle peasants has not been eliminated, and our cadres are not very resolute in implementing the compensation for the losses of the middle peasants.
    Editor's Note: This news reflects an important issue, which is worth the attention of leaders in various regions: it is not enough for the county to simply hold a meeting and make a resolution. If you do not personally go to the masses to check, and do not actively think of specific methods, even if there is a perfect resolution, it can only form empty words on paper, and the policy still cannot be implemented in the villages. The Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee said: "... After writing resolutions and instructions and making reports, pay close attention to checking the work of the lower levels. Don't assume that what the upper level has solved, the lower level has also solved... There must be ways to understand the situation in a timely manner, and if errors occur, they should be corrected in a timely manner..." We suggest that the leading comrades in Yangcheng immediately check according to this spirit, and personally go to one or several villages to set an example and popularize it throughout the county, which is an effective method.

    不少村干抵抗纠偏  阳城中农仍是恐慌
    领导者应亲自深入到一个村或几个村，作出样子，普及全县。
    【太岳消息】阳城县领导上，上月底曾提出不准损害排挤中农，已经损害了的要赔偿，封门的要开门。一区虽然已调查情况，开始纠正，可是有很多村干部不坚决执行，消极抵抗，还是知错不改，所以很多中农恐慌不安。下白桑干部回村后，只在冬学上提了一下，就没详细解释我们不侵害中农的政策，群众说：“干部在岳庄开会回来（即全县春耕动员大会），一圪包包起来了。”管制的十户“斗争对象”（其中有七户中农），虽然勉强取消管制，但不准宣布，说放一放再说。东进村干部也没好好宣传。记者到东进村附村张庄调查，许多人根本不知道县上开的是什么会。淇纳一家中农，往外藏粮被没收了三石，现在提出要赔偿，一个小组长说：“死也不给他往回送”。分委路改行听见，也不坚持往回退。淇纳小学教员给群众读报，读了不应侵犯中农新闻，“贫雇组”便开会商议，批评不该读报。这时有人放牛吃了中农半亩油菜，小学教员说不该吃，“雇贫”又开会讨论，将小学教员吓慌了，已吃了的油菜也不赔偿，中农心很不安定。记者到该村碰到一个中农正吃干饭，他马上向记者解释道：“今天在互助组生产才吃干饭。”另一家中农被斗争后，正饿着肚子，他兄弟本来有粮也不敢借。这说明了中农恐慌并没消除，咱们干部对赔偿中农损失，执行的很不坚决。
    编者按：这个消息里，反映出一个重要问题，值得各地领导者注意：县里只是开了会，作出决议是非常不够的，如果不亲自到群众中检查，不积极想具体办法，虽有完善的决议，也只能形成纸上空文，政策仍不能贯彻到村。中央局给太岳区党委的指示上说：“……在写出决议指示作过报告后，密切注意检查下级工作，不要以为上级解决了的事，下级也解决了，……必须有办法及时了解下情，有错误发生，应及时纠正……”我们建议阳城领导同志依据这个精神，立即检查，并亲自到一个村或几个村作出样子，普及全县，才是有效办法。
