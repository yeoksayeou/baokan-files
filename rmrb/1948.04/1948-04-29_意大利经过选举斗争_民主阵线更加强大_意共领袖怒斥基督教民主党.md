　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 27th: Rome Report: L'Unità recently published an article by Italian Communist Party Deputy Secretary Xie Jie, pointing out: The People's Democratic Front is now stronger and more steadfast after the election struggle. It has proven itself to be the most solid and active force in the country. The Italian Communist Party has not only repelled the desperate attacks of the reactionaries from all sides, but has also taken a greater step forward than in 1946. It will have more representatives in parliament than before. Communist, Socialist, and independent figures previously held 169 seats in the National Assembly, and will now hold 182 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. Xie Jie went on to angrily condemn the Christian Democratic Party for depriving the Italian people of their electoral freedom and for their despicable acts of undermining the Republic's constitution. He stated: "The Italian people and their representatives in parliament must not ignore the clamor to revive autocratic tyranny under the guise of the Republic's constitution." Xie Jie firmly said: The Italian people uniting around the People's Democratic Front are growing ever larger, and they are ready not only to defend democratic freedom, but also to implement the reforms stipulated in the constitution to guarantee peace and a new life for the Italian people. Xie Jie concluded: "We will resolutely use all democratic powers guaranteed by the constitution to fight against this regime which is 'representative' in name but autocratic and tyrannical in substance."

    民主阵线更加强大
    意共领袖怒斥基督教民主党
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】罗马讯：日前团结报发表意共副书记谢杰一文，指出：人民民主阵线在选举斗争后更加强大和坚强了。它已证明自己是国内最坚强、最积极的力量。意共不但已击退反动派从一切方面的拼命进攻，而且比一九四六年更迈进了一大步。在议会中将较以往有更多的代表。共、社与独立党人士以前在国民议会中有一六九席，以后在众院中将有一八二席。谢杰继怒斥基督教民主党人剥夺意人民选举自由，破坏共和国宪法的卑劣行为，他称：“意人民及其在议会中的代表，决不能漠视在共和国宪法掩护下使专制暴政复活的叫嚣。”谢杰坚定地说：团结在人民民主阵线周围的意大利人民愈来愈广大了，他们已准备好不仅保卫民主自由，而且要实行宪法所规定的改革，以保证意国人民的和平及新生活。谢杰结语说：“我们决运用宪法所保证的一切民主权力进行斗争，反对这一表面上是‘代议制’实质上是专制主义与暴政的政权。”
