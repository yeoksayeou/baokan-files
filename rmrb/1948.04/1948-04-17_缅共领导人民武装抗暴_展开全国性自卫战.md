Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 14th: Reports from various sources indicate that the struggle for independence and democracy by the Burmese people is surging to unprecedented heights. This is a result of the nationwide anti-communist and anti-democratic movement launched by the reactionary government of Tekin Nu, nurtured by the US and Britain, at the end of last month. The people's armed forces under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party have now risen up in various places to resist the violent suppression by the reactionary authorities. According to various sources, the flames of the people's just war of self-defense have spread from Migio (only 60 miles from Yangon) and the Bago region to Pyinmana and Taungoo regions in the central part of the country, the Bassein region and the Irrawaddy Delta in the south, the Karen region bordering Siam in the east, and the extreme north of Burma. It is reported that the Diko ethnic group on the Siamese-Burmese border has also participated in the armed struggle against tyranny. The people's armed forces once occupied an important stronghold in Metigo Village in the Bago region. They defended it for three days under the joint attack of the reactionary government's army and air force before withdrawing automatically. The reactionary government's communique on the 10th admitted that the people's armed forces had captured a police station in the Bassein region, captured some enemies, and seized a large number of weapons and supplies. According to a US United Press report on the 11th, the Burmese Communists "control a considerable area outside the major cities." The Burmese reactionary authorities are extremely panicked and have declared martial law in southern Yangon and other places, arresting patriotic and democratic people on a large scale, and dispatching military police equipped with US and British weapons, vainly attempting to save the critical situation. However, according to the United Press, due to the strength of the Burmese people's democratic forces, even Washington's US imperial officials are deeply worried, saying: "It is difficult for the Burmese government to eliminate the Communist Party in the near future. Intelligence from all sides confirms that the Burmese government has not exaggerated the serious situation it faces." It also said: "The Burmese government may face a long and fierce struggle" (United Press).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 15th: Yangon Dispatch: The Burmese People's Armed Forces are actively attacking and harassing the invading enemy forces. According to a communique issued by the reactionary Tekin Nu government on the 11th, the People's Armed Forces attacked a military vehicle in Kangtai, north of Mandalay, killing and wounding several invading military police. The enemy's arsenal and other facilities in Myaydu (located on the east bank of the middle reaches of the Irrawaddy River, an important town between Mandalay and Yenangyaung) were also severely damaged by the People's Army. At the same time, the People's Army completely destroyed the bridge between Mida and Notoyo. In the Bassein area, the People's Armed Forces seized 3,500 bags of military grain in a victorious attack on the enemy.

　　缅共领导人民武装抗暴
  　展开全国性自卫战
    【新华社陕北十四日电】各方讯：缅甸人民为独立、民主的斗争浪潮，空前高涨，这是美英培养下的德钦努反动政府上月底发动全国性反共反民主运动的结果。缅共领导下的人民武装，现已在各地奋起抗击反动当局的暴力弹压。据各方消息：自密芝俄（距仰光仅六十英里）、庇古区至中部的平蛮、倘古区，南部之巴森区及伊洛瓦底三角洲，东部与暹逻接壤之卡伦区，以及缅甸之极北部，均已燃遍人民正义自卫战争的烽火。据悉，暹缅边境之第戈民族亦已参与抗暴武装斗争。人民武装一度占领庇古区米提哥村重要据点一处，在反动政府陆空军联合攻击下，坚守三日始行自动撤离。十日反动政府公报供认：人民武装已攻占巴森区警察站，俘敌若干，并缴获大批武器、物资。据美帝合众社十一日电称：缅共“控制着大城市以外的相当大的地区”。缅反动当局现极为慌张，已在仰光南部等地宣布戒严，大肆逮捕爱国民主人士，并出动以美英武器装备的军警，妄图挽救危局。但据合众社透露：由于缅人民民主势力的强大，甚至华盛顿美帝官员亦深表忧虑称：“缅政府很难在不久的将来消灭共产党，各方面的情报证实，缅甸政府并没有夸张他们所面临的严重形势。”又说：“缅甸政府可能面临着长期而激烈的斗争局面”（合众社）。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】仰光讯：缅甸人民武装积极出击，袭扰来犯敌军。据十一日德钦努反动政府公报供认：人民武装曾于曼德勒以北之康泰地方袭击军车，毙伤进犯军警数名。免扬区（位于伊洛瓦底河中流东岸，系曼德勒与仁安羌间重镇）敌军火库及其他设施，亦遭人民军严重破坏，人民军同时彻底毁坏密达至诺托益间之桥梁。在巴森区，人民武装胜利袭击敌人时，缴三千五百袋军粮。
