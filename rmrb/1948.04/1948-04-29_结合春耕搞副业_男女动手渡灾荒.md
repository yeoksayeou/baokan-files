    Combine Spring Plowing with Sideline Occupations
    Men and Women Work Together to Overcome the Famine
    [News from Yuanshi] The masses in Yanzhuang are combining spring plowing and production to overcome the famine. Currently, 28 households are weaving [willow] baskets, producing 43 baskets per day. After deducting costs, each basket yields a net profit of 200 yuan, totaling 8,600 yuan. The entire village has 120 spinning wheels, each capable of spinning half a jin [approximately 0.5 kg] of cotton per day, totaling 60 jin. Each jin can earn 550 yuan, totaling 33,000 yuan. The entire village has five looms, each weaving an average of half a bolt of cloth per day, which can earn 1,200 yuan, totaling 3,000 yuan. The total income from the above items for the entire village is 44,000 yuan per day, which can solve some of the difficulties caused by the famine.
