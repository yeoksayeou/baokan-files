　　Taihang Qinyang Work Group
　　Starts to Reorganize Mass Ranks
[Taihang News] The Bo'ai Work Group of the Taihang District Party Committee, in order to create experience in the land reform in northern Henan, transferred to Qinyang on the twenty-fifth day of the first lunar month, together with the Fifth District Work Group of the county and the Peking University Work Team, a total of fifty-eight people, forming the Qinyang Work Group, and were assigned to the four key point villages of Xiazhuang, Yangcun, Baofang, and Kongcun. These four key points have a total of fourteen natural villages, one thousand and seventy-one households, and three thousand six hundred and thirty-one people, all located about fifteen miles west of the city. The south bank of the Qin River is a plain that is flooded nine years out of ten, often turning into a "glass land" (as the masses call the flooded land), with only summer and no autumn. Therefore, life is difficult, and in addition to agriculture, many engage in handicrafts to make up for the deficiency. Women's spinning and weaving are even more common, and most have the habit of farming. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, after the burning and killing by the enemy, the oppression by the stubborn and puppet regimes, and the looting by bandits, coupled with the disasters of 1931 and 1932, the population has fled in large numbers, and many have died. Now, the labor force and livestock in each village are extremely lacking, and the number of households without heirs and runaway households is very large. There is much wasteland with no one to cultivate it, and four or five out of ten households in each village are widowed, orphaned, elderly, or weak. After the liberation in October 1945, a movement to redeem land and reverse verdicts was carried out. In 1946, there was a movement against traitors and despots, and land reform in the autumn. Then in October, it was occupied by the Chiang bandits. In April last year, a counter-reckoning movement was carried out, and after the second liberation in July, another movement combining the fight against traitors for revenge with land reform was carried out, and the poor and hired peasants generally obtained land. A month ago, the Fifth District Work Group had already colluded with the poor and hired peasants here to organize a poor peasant association, and was preparing to further collude with the middle peasants to establish a peasant association. On the 28th, all comrades went down to the villages to conduct in-depth visits and understand the situation. After six or seven days, it was found that the poor and hired peasants were not very enthusiastic, and did not want land. The members of the poor peasant association did not want to be leaders. In some villages, the chairman of the poor peasant association was afraid of delaying work, and afraid of offending people, so he procrastinated in doing things. When asked if there was feudalism, most said: "A lot!" When asked again, they said: "The bad middle peasants exploit people, can we fight them?" The comrades of the work group also felt very distressed because they could not find big feudal landlords and the poor and hired peasants were not enthusiastic. In order to solve this problem, the committee held an enlarged meeting on April 3rd and 4th to report on the situation and decided on the next step in the work. Comrade Zhao Shizhen of the District Party Committee also attended and participated. Based on the reports from each village, everyone unanimously believed that feudalism had been largely eliminated in these villages, but not thoroughly enough, and most of the poor and hired peasants had been emancipated, but their class consciousness was not high. In addition, some poor and hired peasants still had land requirements. Therefore, the basic approach for the next stage is to focus on the demands of those poor and hired peasants who have not yet been emancipated, use them as the backbone, rectify the poor peasant association, strengthen education for the poor and hired peasants, unite the middle peasants to investigate feudalism, and carry out filling-in.

　　太行沁阳工作团
  　着手整编群众队伍
    【太行消息】太行区党委博爱工作团，为了创造豫北土改经验，在正月二十五号转来沁阳和该县五区工作团及北大工作组，共五十八人，合组成沁阳工作团，分到夏庄、杨村、保方、孔村四个基点村。这四个基点，共有十四个自然村，一千零七十一户，三千六百三十一人，都在城西十五里左右。沁河南岸一片平原，十年九淹，经常变为玻璃地（群众称水淹地），有夏无秋。因此，生活困苦，除农业外，多从事手工业。以补不足，妇女纺织，更为普遍，且多有耕作习惯。抗战以来，经过敌人烧杀，顽伪压榨，土匪抢劫，加上卅一、二年的灾荒，人口大量逃亡，死的不少。现在各村劳力、牲口都极缺乏，绝户地、逃户地数量很多，有不少荒地无人耕种，各村十有四五为孤寡老弱。四五年十月解放后，曾进行过赎地倒产运动，四六年反奸霸，秋天土改，随于十月为蒋匪所侵占，去年四月进行反倒算，七月二次解放后，又经过反奸复仇结合土改运动，贫雇一般都得到了土地。前一个月，五区工作团，在这里已串通贫雇，组织起贫农团，正准备进一步串通中农成立农会。廿八号全体同志下到各村，作深入访问，了解情况，经过六七天的光景，发现贫雇劲头不大，不愿要土地，贫农团委员，不愿当带头人。有的村贫农团主席，怕误工，怕得罪人，办事推推拖拖。问封建有没有，大多说：多啦！再问就说：“坏中农剥削人，能不能斗？”工作团同志们也因为找不到大封建，贫雇没劲头，感到很苦恼。团委会为解决这个问题，在四月三、四两日，召开扩大会议，汇报情况，决定下一段工作做法。区党委赵时真同志，也出席参加。根据各村汇报，大家一致认为这些村庄封建大体上消灭了，但不够彻底，贫雇农大部分翻了身，而阶级觉悟不高。另有一部分贫雇，还有土地要求。因此，下一段的基本做法是：集中那些未翻身的贫雇要求，以他们为骨干，整顿贫农团，加强对贫雇的教育，团结中农查封建，进行填补。
