	Harnessing Great Production Enthusiasm in Hexi
	Middle Peasants Wrongly Struggled Against Receive Compensation and Actively Establish Households

[This news report] After the democratic rectification of the Party in the Ninth District of Wu'an, and the completion of the supplementary work, it immediately shifted to organizing production. A new atmosphere has emerged in the whole village, and the enthusiasm for spring plowing is generally high. In particular, the middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against have received compensation this time. They have land and houses, and the farm association's dividends in the cooperative are also distributed to them. They have also been given adjustments of grain, and they have no difficulties in terms of production capital and means of living. They are working very hard. For example, Zhang Baohe, a middle peasant who was wrongly struggled against, plans to establish his own household, plant flowers and flax, buy winnowing baskets and shovels, and urge his wife and children to clean the yard and repair the house all day long. He is particularly enthusiastic. His wife said, "Last year, we didn't know when the struggle would end. We were afraid of hearing about meetings. This year, we have houses and land. If we work hard for another year, we will be able to buy a small ox next year." Baohe wrote a letter to his second son (in the hospital in the front): "Our family is now classified as a middle peasant and has been allocated more than 20 mu of land. I am working in the oil mill, and your mother is taking care of children for others. This year's production will definitely be good. You don't have to worry, and you don't have to come back. Study hard outside." On the 19th, a mass meeting was held to issue temporary land certificates. His third son took them home first, but he was worried and hurried back, saying, "Put the land certificate away, don't let the mice bite it." Only then did he go back to the meeting. The old middle peasant Du Hei was most worried about moving his land and house. As a result, nothing was moved, and he was very happy and actively engaged in production. The poor peasant Jia Deyi went to dig the embankment early the next morning after being allocated land. The new middle peasant Zhang Youde bought more than 50,000 yuan worth of manure for his six mu of land, applying 30 loads of manure and 100 jin of sesame cakes per mu. Everyone said, "This year's production is more enthusiastic than any other year." Now all the manure has been delivered, and everyone is competing to compost and buy manure, with almost every mu exceeding 30 loads. In addition, the Party members have made great progress through this democratic rectification of the Party. A few days ago, the branch held a meeting to discuss and decide on the current central task, that is, to lead the masses in production, and Party members should first actively play an exemplary role and promote and lead the masses in production with action. For example, Zhang Tongshan (poor peasant) and Zhang Yanggen (middle peasant), who did not work hard last year, have now changed a lot. Tongshan did his own work and also worked odd jobs for others selling vegetables. Yanggen goes to the field to water the garden every day, often getting up at five o'clock to sell vegetables in other villages. Zhang Qigui, who was the worst at labor, is now also doing his best to pick up and cut labor. They have all sincerely accepted the Party's punishment and the education of the working brothers, and are determined to correct their mistakes. Other Party members are also producing very actively. Retired soldier Jia Wangzi (Party member) is delivering manure and hoeing the ground with a limp, and this year he automatically does not need substitute cultivation.

　　Under the principle of democracy and voluntariness, mutual aid was also reorganized. Last year, there were eight mutual aid groups in total, but only three groups achieved relatively good results. The main reasons were: (1) The strength of labor was uneven, and the division was not clearly defined, with considerations for personal relationships. (2) Some people only cared about themselves. Others hoed the ground for them, but they wanted to go out to produce or water the garden, and were unwilling to return the labor by paying money (because the wages of the mutual aid group were low), which others were not satisfied with. (3) Some households did not pay the rice after settling the accounts, and it was delayed until the end of the year. The groups discussed and decided to adopt absolutely voluntary combination this year, dividing work according to labor and tasks, and carefully calculating accounts. First, organize voluntary registration centered on the old mutual aid groups, and discuss and stipulate the method of converting work points: plowing one mu of land with livestock is 1.5 work points, and delivering manure for one day is one work point. The labor is divided according to the materials, and the price is quoted based on experience. Some groups also proposed: "In the future, we will look at the labor, those who are good can be added, and those who are lazy will be criticized." It was decided to settle accounts every ten days, implement work tickets, and return rice instead of money. Now, a total of six major groups have been established in the village, with 97 households participating, accounting for 80% of the total number of households in the village. Everyone's production enthusiasm is very high, guaranteeing deep plowing and meticulous cultivation this year, plowing twice and hoeing once, applying 30 loads of manure per mu, and buying sesame cakes if not enough. Zhang Shou, a well-to-do farmer, has already applied 50 loads of manure per mu this year, and more than one mu has reached 70 loads. The whole village is now busy planting flowers, and more than 140 mu have been planted. Women's spinning and weaving, the groups with a good mutual aid foundation last year have automatically resumed, and the most have spun 12 jin of cotton, and the general have also spun 7 or 8 jin. They also requested organization, and some groups proposed: "Last year, there were people in charge of the mutual aid group, and there was a reward for oil, but this year no one even asks about it." After discussion at the meeting, six major groups and four small groups have now been voluntarily combined, and each group competes, and the cooperative rewards kerosene.

　　河西生产劲头大
  　错斗中农得到补偿积极建立家务
    【本报消息】武安九区河西民主整党抽补完成后，立即转入组织生产，全村出现一种新气象，春耕情绪普遍高涨。特别是错斗中农，这次得了补偿，地和房子都有了，农会果实存在合作社的股金，分给他们也不少，又给他们调剂了粮食，生产资本和生活资料，都没什么困难了，劳动得非常起劲。如斗错中农张保和，计划建立自己家务，种花、种大麻子，买箩头、买锹，还督促老婆孩子成天打扫院子修补房子，劲头特别大。他老婆说：“去年不知斗争到哪天是个头，一听见开会就害怕，今年有了房子地，再好好整务一年，明年就能买个小牛了。”保和给他二儿子（在前方医院）写信说：“咱家现在划成了个中农，分了二十几亩地，我在油坊打油，你娘给人看孩子，今年生产一定能闹好，你不必惦记，也不用回来，好好在外学习”。十九日开群众大会发下临时土地证，他三儿子先拿回家去了，他不放心，连忙赶回去说：“把土地证放好，可不敢叫老鼠咬了。”说了才又去开会。老中农杜黑的最担心怕动他的地和房子，结果一点没动，非常高兴，生产很积极。贫农贾德义分了地，第二天清早就去刨堰。新中农张有的，六亩地买了五万多块钱的粪，每亩上三十驮子粪和一百斤麻饼。大都家说：“今年的生产比哪年劲头都大。”现在全村粪已送完，都争着沤粪买粪，差不多每亩都超过卅驮子。另外，经过这次民主整党，党员的进步很大。前几日支部开会讨论决定目前中心工作，即领导群众生产，党员应首先积极起模范作用，用行动推动与领导群众生产。如去年不好好劳动的张同山（贫农）、张羊根（中农），现在大变了样。同山做了自己的活，还给别人打短工卖菜。羊根每天去地浇园，经常起五更到外村卖菜。劳动最差的张杞贵，现在也是尽力的拾砍劳动。他们都诚恳的接受了党的处分与劳动兄弟的教育，决心改错，其他党员也都生产的非常积极。荣退军人贾旺子（党员），拐着一条腿送粪锄地，今年自动不用代耕。
    在民主自愿原则下，又进行整顿互助。去年大小共八个互助组，仅有三组的成绩比较好，其他几组根本没互助起来。主要的原因是：（一）劳力强弱不均，没有确实订分，有情面关系。（二）有的人光顾自己，别人给他锄了地，他想出去生产或浇园，不愿还工愿意出米（因互助组工资低），别人不满意。（三）有个别户算了帐不给米，一直拖欠到年底。各小组讨论，今年采取绝对自愿结合，按劳力按活定分，勤算帐。先以旧互助组为中心自愿报名组织，讨论规定折工办法：牲口犁地一亩个半工，送粪一天一个工。劳力是看材料订分，看行说价。有的组并提出：“将来看劳动，好的能加，赖的还要去点。”决定十日一算帐，实行工票，还米不还钱。现在全村一共成立六大组，已经有九十七户参加，占全村户数的百分之八十。大家生产情绪都非常高涨，保证今年深耕细作，犁两遍锄一遍，每亩上三十驮子粪，不够的买麻饼。好受家张寿，今年每亩已上了五十驮子粪，有一亩多已达到七十驮。全村现正忙种花，已种了一百四十余亩。妇女纺织，去年互助基础好的组早自动恢复起来了，最多的已纺了老秤十二斤花，普遍的也都纺了七、八斤。他们也要求组织，有的组提出：“去年互助组还有人管，奖励油，今年到这会连问都没人问。”经过开会讨论，现在自愿结合起六大组、四小组，各组比赛，合作社奖励灯油。
