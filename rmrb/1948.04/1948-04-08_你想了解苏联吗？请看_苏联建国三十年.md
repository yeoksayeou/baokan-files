　　Everyone is concerned about the construction of the Soviet Union, because this is a major event that has a decisive impact on the future of mankind. If the industry of the Soviet Union surpasses American imperialism, that means that the world's peace and democratic forces are inviolable and have an absolute advantage. The world will eliminate war, and mankind will finally be liberated from the threat of war.
　　This book separately describes the Soviet industry over the past thirty years and the Soviet agriculture over the past thirty years, which is of great help for us to understand the past and present construction of the Soviet Union.

    现在大家都在关心苏联的建设，因为这是对人类前途具有决定意义的大事。如果苏联的工业超过美国帝国主义，那就是说：世界和平、民主力量，已经不可侵犯，已经占有绝对优势，世界便会消除战争，人类便会最后从战争威胁里解放出来。
    这册书分别叙述了三十年来的苏联工业与三十年来的苏联农业，对我们了解苏联过去与今天的建设，都有很大帮助。
