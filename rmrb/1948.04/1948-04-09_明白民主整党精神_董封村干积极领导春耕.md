　　【Taiyue News】After studying articles and news such as "Admitting and Correcting Mistakes is the Only Way Out," the village cadres of Dongfeng Town, Yangcheng County, have temporarily put down their ideological baggage and are leading the masses in spring plowing, determined to correct their past mistakes. Since the establishment of the hire-poor group in the village in early November last year, they have struggled against Zhang Xuegeng, the public security officer who shielded landlords, had an undemocratic work style, and was corrupt, at a mass meeting, regardless of everything. This caused panic among cadres with problems. The deputy town chief, Yan Shini, was so frightened that he didn't eat for a whole day, the production director, Yan Shangfa, was afraid to say a word, and the farmers' association director, Pan Biao, stayed at home for half a month, neglecting village work. The anti-illiteracy director, Yang Ruiting, also had diarrhea from fright. All the village cadres carried an ideological burden of fearing struggle and were flustered for more than a month. After studying the newspapers for a few days in December last year, the village cadres began to understand the new spirit, and their emotions improved slightly. The Farmers' Association Director said: "I used to think that the masses in my village regarded me as a target of struggle." Some cadres said: "What the newspaper says is right, we must admit and correct our mistakes to find a way out, and we should make contributions to redeem ourselves." On the fifteenth day of the first month of the lunar year, the village production committee (i.e., cadres of various systems plus representatives of the hired poor) led the masses to rectify the mutual aid groups, democratically re-electing an unqualified squad leader and five group leaders, repairing forty-eight new manure buckets, and more than ten plows, and repairing other hoes, chaff cutters, and hoes. Then they started delivering manure, delivering more than 32,000 loads to more than 700 mu of land in four days. Taking advantage of the rain when they could not go to the fields, they led the masses to fill a large pond with water, about 10,000 loads, which can solve the difficulties of planting in dry weather. Each squad carried more than 40,000 jin of coal, which can be burned during spring plowing. They are now preparing to plow the land.

　　明白民主整党精神
  　董封村干积极领导春耕
    【太岳消息】阳城董封镇村干部，学习了“知错改错才是出路”等文章消息后，已暂时放下了思想包袱，领导群众进行春耕，决心改正自己过去错误。该村自去年十一月初成立起雇贫小组后，就把包庇地主、作风不民主、腐化的公安员张学庚不顾一切在大会上斗争了一次，这样一来，就引起了有毛病的干部恐慌，副镇长燕世尼吓的一天都没吃饭，生产主任燕上法吓的不敢吭气，农会主任潘彪躺在家里有半个月没出门，也不管村里的工作。抗勤主任杨瑞廷也吓的泻肚，全村村干部都背上了一个怕斗争的思想包袱，心慌了一个月多。去年腊月村干部学习了几天报纸后，才开始认识了新精神，情绪稍有好转，农会主任说：“我以前认为俺闾的群众把俺看成斗争对象了。”有的干部说：“人家报纸上说的就是对，咱们要知错改错才有出路，应该立功赎罪才是办法。”正月十五日村生产委员会（即各系统干部加上雇贫代表），就领导群众整顿互助组，把一个不称职的分队长五个小组长民主改选了，修了四十八担新粪桶，十余张犁，其他铣、铡、锄也都修理了。接着开始送粪，四天送了七百余亩，共三万二千余担，又趁下雨不能上地，领导群众灌了一大池水，约一万担，能解决天旱点种困难。各分队担了四万余斤煤，能烧过春耕。现正准备犁地。
