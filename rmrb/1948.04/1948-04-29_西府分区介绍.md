West Fu Sub-district Introduction
West Fu Sub-district (named because it is west of the old Xi'an Prefecture) is located between the Jing and Wei Rivers, west of Xi'an. The central and western parts are the Linshan mountain area, while the eastern, southern, and northeastern parts belong to the Guanzhong Plain area. It includes seven counties in Shaanxi Province: ＠ County, Changwu, Qian County, Yongshou, Liquan, Linshan, and Lingtai in Gansu Province, with a total area of 7,675 square kilometers and a population of approximately 500,000. The area controls the western section of the Longhai Railway and the eastern section of the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, cutting off the connection between Xi'an and Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. At the same time, it can threaten Tianshui and Lanzhou, important military and transportation hubs in the Northwest. To the east, it can cooperate with the Guanzhong and Huanglong Sub-districts and the Yu-Shaan-E Liberation Area to jointly attack Xi'an. Therefore, it is of great importance in military strategy. The masses have always had a very good impression of the People's Liberation Army. In the autumn of 1946, our army reached the area and received much help from the local people. The people in the southern part of the Ji (Mountain) Long (Mountain) area are brave and fierce, and in the past, they often seized weapons from the reactionary army with wood and stones. After 1946, our armed working teams and mountain people's armed forces continued to operate here. Moreover, the area is very rich in cotton and wheat production. According to a survey in Qian County alone in 1946, the annual output of wheat was 280,000 shi (30 catties per dou), and cotton was more than 1.9 million catties. There are also many other products such as coal. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西府分区介绍
    西府分区（因在旧西安府以西得名）在西安以西的泾、渭两河之间，中部和西部是麟游山区，东部、南部及东北部属关中平原区，包括陕西的＠县、长武、乾县、永寿、醴泉、麟游、及甘肃的灵台等七个县，总面积为七千六百七十五平方公里，人口约五十万。该区控制陇海铁路西段及西兰公路东段，截断了西安与甘肃、宁夏、青海的联系，同时可以威胁西北军事交通重镇天水、兰州，东面可与关中、黄龙两分区及豫陕鄂解放区配合夹击西安，因此在军事战略上的地位非常重要。群众历来对解放军印象极好，四六年秋我军曾到达该区，得到当地群众多方帮助，济（山）陇（山）南部民性强悍，过去常以木石夺取反动军队武装，四六年后我之武工队及山区人民武装不断在此活动。又该区出产棉麦极丰，仅乾县一县四六年调查，每年产小麦二十八万石（三十斤一斗），棉花一百九十多万斤，其他如煤产亦不少。            （新华社）
