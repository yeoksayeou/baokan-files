Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 18th: In the Luoyang Campaign, a unit of over two thousand soldiers from the Kuomintang army's Youth Army 206th Division, who were liberated, have been assessed and approved to join the People's Liberation Army and have been incorporated into a training regiment of a certain unit for study. The regiment held an opening ceremony on the 10th. Director Liu, the political director of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, attended and delivered a speech, extending a warm welcome to all the trainees for voluntarily joining the People's Liberation Army. He explained the Chinese Communist Party's policy of uniting, educating, and winning over intellectuals, and encouraged everyone to work hard to transform themselves and become glorious people's revolutionary fighters in the future. Director Liu said: "The People's Liberation Army deeply sympathizes with everyone's past painful experiences under Chiang Kai-shek's deception and is willing to use all its strength to help everyone recover from their spiritual wounds and rescue everyone from the darkness. The People's Liberation Army will especially cherish those intellectual youths who have undergone training and transformation and are determined to serve the people, and will strive to make the best use of their talents in their assignments." Zhang Zhicheng, a representative of the trainees and a second-class soldier from the Search Company of the 1st Brigade of the Youth Army 206th Division, delivered a reply. He excitedly said to all the trainees: "I personally witnessed in Xi'an and Hanzhong how Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army buried countless patriotic young students alive. In Luoyang, Qiu Xingxiang personally directed us to tear down and burn the houses of the four gates, forcing many kind ordinary people to their deaths. It is very clear who is murdering, arsoning, and harming young people. In the past, we were deceived by Chiang Kai-shek and committed crimes against the people. However, the Communist Party not only rescued us but also forgave us so generously and educated us. We must study hard and redeem our sins to the people through our actions in the future."

　　洛阳战役中解放战士
    二千余自动参加我军
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十八日电】洛阳战役中获得解放的蒋军青年军二○六师士兵一部二千余人，已被考核批准参加解放军，并编入某部学兵总队学习。十日该队举行开学典礼，解放军某部政治部刘主任亲临致词，对全体学员自动参加解放军表示热烈的欢迎，并讲解中国共产党团结、教育与争取知识分子的政策，勖勉大家努力改造自己，将来成为光荣的人民革命战士。刘主任说：“解放军极其同情大家过去在蒋介石欺骗下痛苦的遭遇，愿意以一切力量帮助大家恢复精神上的创伤，将大家从黑暗中拯救出来。对于经过锻炼改造而坚决愿意为人民服务的知识青年，解放军一定格外爱护，在任用上务做到人尽其才，才尽其用。”学员代表青年军二○六师第一旅搜索连二等兵张志诚致答词，他激动的对全体学员说：“我在西安、汉中亲眼看见蒋匪军活埋了无数爱国青年学生，在洛阳邱行湘并亲自指挥我们扒掉和焚毁四关的民房，逼死了多少善良的老百姓，究竟是谁杀人放火、残害青年，这是非常明白的。过去我们受蒋介石的欺骗，对人民犯了罪，可是共产党不仅解救了我们，而且又这样宽大的原谅我们，教育我们，我们一定要好好学习，将来在行动中向人民赎罪。”
