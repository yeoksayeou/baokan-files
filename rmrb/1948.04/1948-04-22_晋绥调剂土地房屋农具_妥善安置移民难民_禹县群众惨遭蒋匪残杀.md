Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 15th: The rural areas of Jin-Sui are warmly receiving and resettling immigrants from northern Shaanxi and large numbers of refugees fleeing from the Yan bandit areas of central Shanxi. Kela County has resettled 246 immigrant households, totaling 796 people, all of whom have been allocated land, housing, farm tools, and rations. Liu Xinda, a representative from Tu Zhai Village, invited Zhang Mingben, a refugee from Jia County, to his home for a meal, then provided him with rations, found him housing, and delivered firewood. Influenced by his actions, all thirteen households in the village competed to offer gifts. The Cui couple, immigrants to Muguaer Village in Baode, immediately began diligent production after settling down. The husband gathered firewood and carried charcoal, while the wife spun cloth at home, resolving their food shortage. Now they have also been allocated a portion of land and are intensifying their spring plowing. Jiaocheng has resettled more than 150 households and more than 500 refugees who fled from the Yan bandit areas. Each person has been allocated one to two mu of irrigated land and enough mountainous land for cultivation. Those without cattle were given cattle. A certain village specially assigned a donkey to carry coal for the refugees, who were moved to say, "The area led by Chairman Mao is so good." Zhang Jinglu, an immigrant to Nanbu Village in the county, has married and settled down with the help of the masses. Wu Sida and other four immigrant households, totaling eight men and women, from Dananpo Village in Yangqu, have all joined the Poor Peasants' League and handle affairs fairly in the village, treating the liberated area as their new home. The Trade Bureau of the Eighth Sub-district of central Shanxi also allocated 18,000 catties of grain, 7,500 catties of cotton, and 15,000 catties of peach kernels to relieve the immigrants and refugees.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 20th: Before fleeing Liangcheng, the Fu bandit forces set fires everywhere, starting from the vicinity of the Buddhist temple in the city and extending to the northeast and northwest of the city. When the bandit army withdrew from Beiguan, they burned Huanghaozi @ Village into a scorched earth. Groups of homeless refugees fled to the northern mountains. Cui, a 79-year-old widow, went insane because her only four rooms were reduced to ashes, and she cried and shouted in the streets with disheveled hair. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city on the evening of the same day, it concentrated all its efforts to put out the fire. On the third day, the democratic government also provided disaster relief to the victims with 300 dan (each dan is 300 catties) of food and convened a mass meeting to discuss how to resettle the victims.

Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Border Region, 20th: After the third liberation of Yu County, the masses have successively accused Huang Ruzhang, the pseudo-county magistrate of Chiang Kai-shek, of the bloody crimes of brutally massacring more than 500 innocent people during his occupation of the county. Last autumn, when the People's Liberation Army approached the county seat of Yu County, the Huang bandit forces divided more than 300 innocent civilians detained in the prison into batches and either beheaded, buried alive, or shot them at the Beiguan Bridge. The Ying River beach was stained with blood, and corpses were scattered all over the ground or floating along with the current. In January of this year, during the People's Liberation Army's victory in the Ping-Han Campaign, the Huang bandit forces massacred another 45 imprisoned civilians and looted extensively before fleeing to Ping Shan. On the night of March 19, the Huang bandit forces sneaked into the city again, searching and arresting people on the streets, breaking down doors and grabbing people. That night, they captured more than 200 citizens, and the next night, they were all buried alive in the Shirengou area, fifteen li north of the city. Hai Shuiwang and Hai Shuicheng, brothers of the Hui ethnic group in the Qingzhen Temple Street in the South Gate, were also brutally murdered. After the third liberation of Yu County this time, the families of the victims excavated in Shirengou and found six large pits, each containing dozens of people. Those buried were all tightly bound, their eyes bulging, and their heads swollen like drums, including children as young as twelve or thirteen years old. The people of Yu County are extremely resentful of the Huang bandit forces' heinous crimes and unanimously demand that the democratic government seek justice and avenge them.
