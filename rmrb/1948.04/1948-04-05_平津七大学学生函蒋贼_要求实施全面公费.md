Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Beiping News: Student unions from seven universities in Beiping and Tianjin, including Tsinghua, Yenching, Sino-French, Peking, Nankai, Peiyang, and Beiping Normal College, jointly sent a letter on March 20th to the bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek and the Chiang bandit Minister of Education, Zhu Jiahua, demanding the implementation of a full public funding system for all universities in the Chiang-controlled area, increasing education funding to 15% of the total budget, increasing the regular expenses of "National" institutions and subsidies for private institutions, increasing the salaries of faculty and staff according to the price index and distributing goods in kind, and reducing unnecessary courses. The letter exposed the serious educational crisis in Beiping and Tianjin under Chiang's bandit rule, stating: "As far as 'National' institutions are concerned, the general operating expenses are far from the actual needs. Teachers' monthly income is not enough to feed and clothe them. A few publicly funded students are fortunate enough to avoid starvation, but their general health is extremely poor. Taking the recent physical examination at Peking University as an example, 20% had lung disease and 80% were malnourished. 'National' institutions' half-publicly funded and self-funded students are unable to bear the ever-increasing food costs in the face of rising prices. Private universities face a hundred times more financial difficulties than 'National' universities. Private university students are preoccupied all day with food, clothing, borrowing, and pawning, and are also anxious about huge tuition fees, a situation that has reached an extreme. Taking Sino-French University as an example, two weeks after the start of the semester, 55 students were unable to pay their tuition fees. Many students are being rejected from the gates of the universities. The crisis in secondary education is even more serious. On average, one-tenth of the students in Beiping's municipal middle schools are forced to drop out of school. An investigation of materials from 18 private middle schools revealed that one-third of the students could not afford to pay their tuition fees at the beginning of the semester. After being allowed to defer payment, pay tuition fees in installments, and conduct scholarship campaigns, one-fifth of the students are still out of school. Most parents are simply unable to afford their children's tuition fees. General middle school funding is scarce, and teachers' income is insufficient to maintain the minimum living standards for their families."

Another report: Six representatives from the "Joint Association for Rescuing the Education Crisis" of Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Normal College, Sino-French University, and Chaoyang University went to Chiang's bandit Beiping Pacification Headquarters on March 23rd to petition, demanding the continued distribution of flour as before February, raising scholarship funds for universities and middle schools, and opposing the arrest of students and the suppression of academic freedom. Furthermore, students at Peking University pointed out during a symposium last month that the current educational crisis in the Chiang-controlled area is caused by Chiang's bandits waging civil war and the cultural aggression of American imperialism, and put forward slogans such as opposing civil war and students from various schools uniting to fight for full public funding.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Beiping newspaper news: More than one hundred faculty members and students from Tsinghua University held a discussion meeting on the educational crisis in the Chiang-controlled area on February 25th. The participants unanimously agreed that under Chiang's bandit rule, teachers and students have no freedom to conduct academic research, no freedom from hunger, and even less freedom from fear. Therefore, the basic content of the current struggle is anti-enslavement, anti-hunger, and anti-persecution. The specific goals are to reform the curriculum and education system, strive for full public funding and guarantee human rights. The planned work includes suggesting that the Student Union hold an education crisis publicity week, suggesting that the professors' association discuss it, convening a representative conference, and insisting on rescuing arrested students, conducting price statistics as a basis for striving for improved treatment. The meeting finally decided to expand student organizations and human rights protection committees and other organizations, and passed a resolution to form a joint organization composed of faculty, staff, and students to fight for the realization of the above goals. Furthermore, faculty members and students from Beiping Normal College also held a symposium on the educational crisis in the Chiang-controlled area on the evening of March 3rd.

　　平津七大学学生函蒋贼
  　要求实施全面公费
    【新华社陕北三日电】北平讯：平、津清华、燕京、中法、北京、南开、北洋、北平师院七大学学生自治会，三月二十日联名致函匪首蒋介石及蒋匪教育部长朱家骅，提出全蒋管区各大学实施全面公费制、提高教育经费到总预算百分之十五，增加“国立”院校经常费及私立院校补助费，教职员工役按物价指数增薪配发实物，及减少不必要的课程等要求。该函揭露蒋匪统治下平津教育危机严重情况称：就“国立”院校而言，一般经常费与实际所需相差甚巨。教师们月入不敷温饱。少数公费生虽幸免于饿死，但一般健康情形极坏。以北大最近体格检查为例，肺病的达百分之二十，营养不良的达百分之八十。“国立”院校半公费、自费生在物价高涨中，已无力担负不断增涨的膳费。私立大学经费百倍困难于“国立”大学。私大学生一方面整日为衣食借贷典当，还要为巨额学费焦急，情形严重已达极点。以中法为例，开学两周尚有五十五人无力缴纳学费。不少学生被摒弃于学府门外。中等教育危机更严重，北平各市立中学平均有十分之一学生被迫失学。调查十八个私立中学材料结果，开学时有三分之一缴不起学费，经准许缓交、分学期缴纳学费及助学运动后，迄今仍有五分之一学生失学。大部分家长根本无力负担子女学费。一般中学经费枯窘，教员收入不足维持一家最低限度生活。
    另讯：北大、清华、燕京、师院、中法、朝阳六校“抢救教育危机联合会”代表六人，三月二十三日赴蒋匪北平行辕请愿，提出继续二月以前的配发面粉，募捐大中学奖学金及反对逮捕学生及剥削学术自由等要求。又，北大学生上月举行座谈会时指出：目前蒋区教育危机，系由蒋匪进行内战及美国帝国主义文化侵略等原因造成，并提出反对内战及各校学生联合起来争取全面公费等口号。
    【新华社陕北二日电】北平报纸消息：清华大学员生百余人，二月二十五日举行蒋区教育危机讨论会，席上一致认为：在蒋匪统治下，师生没有研究学术的自由，没有免于饥饿的自由，更没有免于恐惧的自由。因此当前斗争的基本内容为反奴化、反饥饿、反迫害。而具体目标为改革课程与教育制度，争取全面公费及人权保障。准备进行的工作为建议学联举办教育危机宣传周，建议教授会加以讨论，召开代表大会及坚持营救被捕同学，进行物价统计工作，作为争取改善待遇的根据。该会最后决定扩大学生团体及人权保障委员会等组织，并通过由教职员及学生组成一联合组织，为实现上述目标而斗争。又，北平师范学院员生亦于三月三日晚举行蒋区教育危机座谈会。
