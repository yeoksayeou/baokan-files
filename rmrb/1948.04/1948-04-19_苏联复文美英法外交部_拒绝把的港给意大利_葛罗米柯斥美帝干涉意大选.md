　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Moscow dispatch: The Soviet government's replies to the U.S., British, and French notes of March 20 and letters of April 9, attempting to revise the peace treaty with Italy and conspiring to hand Trieste over to Italy, were delivered to the British, American, and French Foreign Ministries on the 13th. The note drew the attention of the respective Foreign Ministries to the fact that the peace treaty with Italy and other countries that had participated in the war was prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers, carefully reviewed by the twenty-one-nation Paris Conference, and then signed by them, with ratification and entry into force only a few months ago. Therefore, the Soviet government believes that any suggestion to arrange a private meeting to decide on revising the peace treaty with Italy violates basic democratic principles and is unacceptable to the Soviet Union.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: New York dispatch: In order to increase the election capital for the Italian reactionary parties, the U.S., British, and French reactionaries proposed on the 10th in the Security Council to reconsider accepting Italy into the United Nations. Soviet representative Gromyko ruthlessly exposed this, saying that this proposal was a tactical maneuver aimed at recruiting some Italian voters to support the right-wing parties supported by the United States. The U.S. government has long resorted to unscrupulous means to engage in barbaric interference in Italy's internal affairs, such as spreading propaganda, portraying the United States as a friend of Italy, and deceiving the Italian people by portraying certain other countries as enemies. Gromyko reiterated that the Soviet government agrees that Italy should join the United Nations, but cannot agree to achieve this by infringing upon the legitimate rights of other countries in a similar position to Italy. The peace treaty was concluded with five countries: Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland. These countries have equal reasons to demand to join the United Nations. Gromyko accused the U.S. and Britain of trying to accommodate countries whose domestic systems now conform to the intentions of the U.S. and British governments, while at the same time trying to prevent the accommodation of countries whose domestic systems are not favored by the U.S. and British governments. After exposing these attempts, the Soviet Union once again voted against the proposals of the U.S., Britain, and France. Ukraine also voted against.

　　苏联复文美英法外交部
    拒绝把的港给意大利
  　葛罗米柯斥美帝干涉意大选
    【新华社陕北十七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联政府对美英法妄图修改对意和约，阴谋将的里雅斯特交给意大利的三月二十日照会及四月九日函件的复文，已于十三日分别递交英、美、法外交部。照会提起各该国外交部注意：对意及其它曾参加战争各国的和约，是由外长会议准备，经二十一国巴黎会议详细审议，随后又由她们签订了的，其批准与生效才只数月。因此，苏联政府认为：想布置私下会议来决定修改对意和约的任何建议，乃违反民主的基本原则，决非苏联所能接受。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】纽约讯：美、英、法反动派为谋增添意反动政党竞选资本，于十日在安理会上建议重新考虑接受意大利加入联合国问题。苏代表葛罗米柯予以无情揭发说：这一建议是个策略手段，目的在于招募若干意大利选民来拥护美国支持的右翼政党。美政府久已不择手段地采取野蛮干涉意国内政的行径，如散布宣传，把美国说成意大利的朋友，把某些其他国家说成敌人来愚弄意大利人民。葛氏再度声明：苏联政府同意意大利应加入联合国组织，但是不能同意用侵犯其他与意大利处于类似地位之国家的合法权利的办法来实现。和约是对意、保、罗、匈、芬五国缔订的。这些国家都有同等理由要求加入联合国组织。葛罗米柯指责美、英力图容纳那些国内制度现在符合于美英政府意图的国家，同时又力图阻止容纳那些国内制度非美英政府所好的国家。在揭露了这些企图后，苏联又一次投票反对美、英、法的建议。乌克兰也投票反对。
