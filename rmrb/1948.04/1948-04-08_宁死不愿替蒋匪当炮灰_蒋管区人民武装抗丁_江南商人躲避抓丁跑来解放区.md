　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to comprehensive reports: People in various Chiang-controlled areas are bravely resisting conscription by the Chiang bandits. Last month, Ye Huowang and his son, farmers from a village in Longquan County, western Zhejiang, led the residents of the entire village to repel the Chiang bandit's conscription force; on March 3rd, villagers of Shiqu Township, Huangyan County, western Zhejiang, dissatisfied with the Chiang bandit township government's repeated conscription, gathered more than sixty people, stormed the township government, seized more than ten bandit guns, and wounded two Chiang soldiers; villagers of Sanmen Township in the same county fiercely attacked Chiang bandit conscription personnel on March 25th, resisting bandit conscription. Conscripts in Dongwu Town, Suzhou, Jiangsu, had their families gather in front of the Chiang bandit government to shout grievances and protest. People in Chiang-controlled areas would rather die than be Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers. Wu Xiaoke and Zhu Caiyuan, villagers from the Siming Mountains in Zhejiang, drowned themselves in the sea to avoid being conscripted; Fan Hongshou, a poor peasant from Huguan Township, Wuxi, Jiangsu, painfully cut off his testicles with a sickle; a young man in Shacheng, Chahar, chopped off his right hand. Small merchants from Jiangnan, whose families were in the liberated areas, have flocked back to the liberated areas to escape Chiang bandit conscription, with more than two hundred people returning to Xinfeng, Tunxing and other villages in Jianyang County, northern Jiangsu.
　　Under the Chiang bandits' cruel conscription, tragedies continue to occur everywhere. In Nanyuan Town, Suzhou, old men as old as forty-four have been conscripted. An old woman in the town was stripped naked by the Chiang bandits and forced to hand over her son. Public school staff, merchants, and police officers in Qingdao are also being conscripted. The Wuxi bandit county government is conducting armed conscription day and night, grabbing anyone they can find. Zhang Qinchuan, a villager from Nanwei Township, Jiangsu, was seized by bandits in the middle of the night. His wife chased after him, calling for help. When she returned home at dawn, her young child had frozen to death in bed. Zhang was bailed out and shot dead by Chiang bandits on his way home. In Wuyang Township, Longquan, Zhejiang, Chiang bandit military service supervisors wantonly shot and killed young men. After a sixteen-year-old vendor surnamed Sun from Zhangjiakou, Chahar Province, was seized by bandits and forced into the army, his elderly mother and daughter-in-law had no way to survive and committed suicide together. An elderly couple who ran a meat shop in Dongyaozi in the city cried all day because their son was seized, and later committed suicide by throwing themselves into the river. When Guo, from Xuanhua, had his only son conscripted, Guo killed the puppet Baojia chief who had forced his son into the army with a kitchen knife, and then committed suicide. A Fu bandit stationed in Xiayuan rushed to a coal mine one day to grab conscripts. The coal miners collectively hid in the coal mine to avoid them. The Fu bandit used fire and smoke to spray into the mine, burning more than two hundred workers alive.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Youths in various Chiang-controlled areas are unwilling to be Chiang bandit cannon fodder. Shanghai newspapers revealed on the 27th of last month that twenty of the first batch of thirty-four young men drawn in the forced lottery had already fled. A Hong Kong message on March 30th stated that a large number of young people from Shanghai had poured into Hong Kong in recent weeks. Shipping company personnel said that passenger tickets from Shanghai to Hong Kong were sold out, while there were few buyers for tickets from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Shanghai shipping companies frequently have long lists of people waiting to buy tickets. The Chiang bandits in Tianjin originally planned to conscript 7,500 people by the end of January this year using the draft method, but during this period only 2,250 people were seized. The Chiang bandits were forced to change to using cash allocations for conscript's family expenses to bid for new recruits. This kind of life-selling money rose from the initial six million to ten million on March 1. According to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on March 5th, "Almost no one wants to be a soldier" in various Chiang-controlled areas, and "the most common topic among young people is how to avoid conscription."

　　宁死不愿替蒋匪当炮灰
  　蒋管区人民武装抗丁
    江南商人躲避抓丁跑来解放区
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合各方消息：蒋区各地人民英勇反抗蒋匪征兵。上月中浙西龙泉县某村农民叶火旺父子领导全村居民将蒋匪抓丁武装击退；浙西黄岩县石曲乡乡民因不满蒋匪乡公所一再抓丁，于三月三日集合六十余人，冲入乡公所，夺缴匪枪十余支，并击伤蒋兵二名；该县三门乡民三月二十五日拒匪抓丁痛击蒋匪征兵人员。江苏苏州东吴镇被抓壮丁，家属群集蒋匪政府门前喊冤抗议。蒋区人民宁死不愿当蒋家兵，浙江四明山区乡民吴小克、朱才圆因不愿被抓投海溺死；江苏无锡浒关乡贫农范洪寿忍痛用镰刀割去睾丸；察哈尔沙城某青年将右手砍断。江南蒋区小商人家在解放区者，为逃避蒋匪抓丁，纷纷返回解放区，苏北建阳县新丰、吞兴等村已返回二百余人。
    在蒋匪残酷征抓下，各地不断发生惨剧。苏州南圆镇已征到四十四岁的老头，该镇一老太婆被蒋匪剥光衣服，强迫她交出儿子。青岛公教人员、商人和警察亦在被征之列。无锡匪县府不分昼夜武装抓丁，逢人便抓。江苏南潍乡民张琴川深夜被匪捉去，其妻追踪呼救，天明回家，幼儿冻死床上，张被保释返家途中又遭蒋匪任意开枪击毙。浙江龙泉匪兵役督征员在梧羊乡肆意枪杀青壮年。察省张家口十六岁孙姓小贩被匪抓去当兵后，其家中老母及媳妇无法求生，相偕自杀。该市东窑子肉商老夫妇俩，因其子被抓，痛哭终日，后投河自杀。宣化郭某独子被征，郭某遂以菜刀先将强逼其子当兵之伪保甲长砍死，然后自杀。驻下花园之傅匪一日窜往某煤窑抓丁，煤矿工人集体钻入煤窑内躲避，傅匪用火烟向窑内喷烧，竟将二百余名工人全部活活熏死。
    【新华社陕北六日电】蒋区各地青年均不愿当蒋匪炮灰。上海报纸上月二十七日透露：在强迫抽签中抽的第一批三十四名青年中已有二十名逃跑。香港三月三十日消息，近数周来上海青年大量涌入香港。轮船公司的人员说：由沪来港的客票售卖一空，而由港赴沪客票则很少人买。上海各船公司中经常有等待购票者的长名单。天津蒋匪原定以抽抓办法在本年一月底前征集七千五百人，但在此期间内只抓到二千二百五十人。迫得蒋匪改以摊派壮丁安家费现钱标买新兵，此种卖命钱并由最初的六百万涨到三月一日的一千万。据美联社上海三月五日电说：“蒋区各地‘几乎没有一个人愿意当兵’，青年人中间最普通的一个话题，就是如何逃避征兵。”
