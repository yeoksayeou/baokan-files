【Taiyue News】 The Grain Rain season has arrived, and it is the time to intensify spring plowing and sowing, but the peasants' enthusiasm for production is still not high. Therefore, on the 13th, the Yangcheng County Government issued a proclamation, in addition to explaining that various methods should be used to help the poor and hired peasants who have not yet overturned or have not completely overturned to solve their spring plowing difficulties, especially emphasizing the need to resolutely correct the phenomenon of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants: (1) Middle peasant (including wealthy middle peasant) doors that have been wrongly sealed should be unsealed, and middle peasants under control should have their control lifted. (2) Without the government's permission, no one shall be deprived of their civil rights or illegally sentenced. (3) In addition to the government's stipulated grain and money burdens based on wealth, and labor service burdens based on labor, it is illegal to additionally increase the grain, money, labor service, and military shoe burdens of middle peasants, or to force "enlightenment," "mobilization," or deliberately reduce the wages of middle peasants in mutual aid groups. These must be corrected immediately. Anyone who randomly beats or levies again will be held responsible by the government and dealt with according to law. (4) It is forbidden to arbitrarily restrict the legitimate trading relationships and daily life freedoms of middle peasants. (5) It is forbidden to arbitrarily fabricate crimes for people, randomly label them, or abolish the practice of parading people in the streets with insults to their personality as punishment. In addition, of the 45 million yuan in spring plowing loans issued by the government, in addition to lending to hired and poor peasants, some must also be lent to middle peasants with more difficulties.

    谁再乱打滥派要追责任
    【太岳消息】谷雨已到，正是加紧春耕下种的时候，可是农民生产劲头还不大。因此阳城县政府十三日出了布告，除说明要用各种办法帮助未翻身与翻身不彻底的贫雇农解决春耕困难外，特别强调指出要坚决纠正侵犯中农利益的现象：（一）错封了中农（富裕中农在内）门的，一律开封，管制的中农，一律解除管制。（二）未经政府，不得褫夺公民权及非法判罪。（三）除政府规定的粮款负担按富力、差务负担按劳动力外，额外加重中农的粮款差务军鞋等负担，或强迫“开明”、“动员”，互助组中故意减低中农的工资等，都是非法行为，一定要立刻改正。谁要再乱打滥派、政府定要追究责任，依法处理。（四）禁止随便限制中农的正当买卖关系及日常生活等自由。（五）禁止任意给人捏造罪名，乱戴帽子，废除用侮辱人格的游街办法处罚人民。此外政府发放之春耕贷款四千五百万元，除贷给雇贫农外，还一定贷一些给困难较多的中农。
