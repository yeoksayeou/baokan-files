Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: News from various sources: New democratic countries in Eastern Europe continue to expand economic ties with each other and with the Soviet Union, and develop trade relations with Western European countries. After lengthy negotiations, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Bulgarian trade delegation signed a trade and navigation treaty and a 1948 exchange of goods agreement in Moscow on the 1st. The former stipulates that the two countries enjoy most-favored-nation treatment, and the latter stipulates the quantity and procedures for the exchange of goods between the two countries this year. Bulgaria also signed a trade agreement with Czechoslovakia in Prague on the 7th, stipulating that Czechoslovakia will exchange industrial products such as hardware, machinery, cotton textiles, and paper with Bulgaria for raw materials and agricultural products. Czechoslovakia also signed two permanent supplementary treaties with Poland in Warsaw on the 6th, to the July of last year Polish-Czech Economic Cooperation Treaty and Cultural Cooperation Agreement. The treaties stipulate that the two countries shall not discriminate against each other's nationals working in their respective countries, and stipulate the widespread exchange of scientific information and mutual use of sanatoriums and other health centers. Poland and Czechoslovakia have also recently signed trade agreements with the United Kingdom separately. Poland will export food and timber worth 11 million pounds to the food-scarce United Kingdom this year. Poland also signed a trade agreement with the Netherlands in The Hague at the end of last month with a total value of 25 million Dutch guilders.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Moscow News: The Finnish delegation left the Soviet Union for Finland on the 9th. Soviet Prime Minister Pekkala delivered a farewell speech at the Moscow station, thanking Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and other Soviet officials who came to see them off. Mr. Pekkala pointed out: "The Soviet-Finnish conditions will forever eliminate prejudice between the two countries. It will be an important milestone in the history of our two countries. It will bring solid and real peace to our two countries. But if the contracting parties do not take practical actions, the written treaty will become a dead letter. We have sufficient reason to embody the written words into practical actions." Helsinki News: Finnish President Paasikivi gave a radio speech to the nation on the same day: praising "During the treaty negotiations, the Soviet Union fully considered Finland's views and wishes. As far as Finland is concerned, the treaty is very satisfactory." Finally, Mr. Ba solemnly declared: "There are no additional secret clauses in the treaty. The era of the Soviet-Finnish War is gone forever."

　　东欧新民主诸国家
  　经济连系日趋紧密
    【新华社陕北十二日电】各方讯：东欧新民主诸国相互间及与苏联间继续扩展经济连系，并发展对西欧国家的贸易关系。苏联对外贸易部与保加利亚商务代表团经长期谈判后，已于一日在莫斯科签订商务及航海条约与一九四八年换货协定，前者规定两国同享最惠国待遇，后者规定今年两国换货数量及程序。保国又于本月七日与捷克在布拉格签订贸易协定，规定捷克以五金、机器、棉织品、纸张等工业制成品与保国交换原料及农产品。捷克又于六日与波兰在华沙签订去年七月波、捷经济合作条约及文化合作协定的两个永久性补充条约，规定两国彼此不得歧视在两国境内工作的对方侨民，并规定广泛交换科学情报，互相利用休养所及其他疗养中心等。波兰与捷克并于最近分别与英国订立贸易协定，波兰今年将输出价值一千一百万英镑的食物与木料等至粮食困难的英国，波兰并曾于上月底与荷兰在海牙签订换货总值达二千五百万荷币的贸易协定。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】莫斯科讯：芬兰缔约代表团于九日离苏返芬，苏总理皮可拉在莫斯科车站曾发表临别演说，向到站欢送之苏外长莫洛托夫及其他苏联官员致谢。皮氏指出：“苏芬条件将永远消除两国间的偏见，它将是我两国历史上重要的里程碑，它将使我两国获得巩固和真正的和平。但如果缔约国双方不采取实际行动，则书面的条约就会成为一纸空文，我们有充分理由能把书面的字句体现为实际的行动。”又赫尔辛基讯：芬总统巴锡基维于同日向全国发表广播演说：赞扬“在缔约谈判过程中，苏联充分考虑芬兰的观点与意愿，对芬兰而言，条约甚可满意。”巴氏最后郑重声明：“条约并无任何附加的秘密条款，苏芬战争的时代业已一去不复返。”
