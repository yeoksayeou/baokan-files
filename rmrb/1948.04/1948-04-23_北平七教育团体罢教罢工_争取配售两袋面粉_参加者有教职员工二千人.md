　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: A delayed Peiping dispatch reports that amidst the wave of student strikes against oppression and hunger in Peiping and Tianjin universities, seven educational groups from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and the Peiping Research Institute have united to launch a three-day joint strike against hunger, starting on the 6th of this month, to fight for the continued allocation of two bags of flour and improved treatment. The seven groups are the Lecturers and Teaching Assistants Association of Peking University, the Staff Union, the Workers and Police Union, the Faculty Association of Tsinghua University, the Staff Union, the Workers and Police Union, and the Research Assistants Association of the Peiping Research Institute. A total of more than 2,000 people are participating in this anti-hunger struggle, including 517 lecturers and teaching assistants, 760 staff members, 810 workers and police, and 40 graduate students from the Peiping Research Institute. The seven groups recently issued an "Open Letter to the Public on Fighting for Reasonable Treatment" and a "Telegram to the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Education of the Chiang Bandit Regime." The open letter states: "The plight of those in the education sector did not begin today, but today it has reached the point of unbearable suffering. Since the (Chiang) government announced the salary adjustment measures for public education personnel in January, this measure ostensibly calculates salaries based on the so-called cost of living index. In form, the amount of 'legal tender' received is slightly higher, but in reality, the income has been greatly reduced. The authorities are frantically issuing currency, causing prices to skyrocket, forcing us to struggle with hunger and face the threat of death. On the other hand, the original method of allocating flour has been cancelled, making it difficult for us to survive. Isn't this adjustment a cruel mockery? In the past few months, in addition to widespread poverty among those in the education sector, with no food for three meals a day and children crying from hunger, some have suffered nervous breakdowns, leading to madness; some have taken poison, and some have jumped from buildings. These tragic scenes are all visible and audible. We want to ask: Who made them like this? We want to loudly ask: Who has brought them to this state? For the past two months, we have repeatedly appealed for flour allocation and salary adjustments, until our lips are dry and our pens are worn out, but the answer we have received is: absolutely not allowed. We now have no other choice but to take active action to urge the (Chiang) government to accept our demands. We believe that our legitimate income has been seized by the (Chiang) government through inflation by more than 90 percent, and we have the right to demand that the (Chiang) government guarantee our freedom from hunger. We hope to gain the sympathy and support of the public and students' parents." The telegram to the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Education of the Chiang bandit government requests the following: "(1) Starting from February of the 37th year [1948], continue to allocate flour monthly according to the quantity and price of flour allocated in January, and implement the allocation of other essential goods. (2) Pay salaries monthly according to the actual cost of living index in the local area, and increase the base salary for technicians and workers and police. The base salary for each worker and police officer shall not be less than 20 yuan. (3) Academic research subsidies shall be adjusted and paid monthly according to the actual cost of living index."

　　北平七教育团体罢教罢工
    争取配售两袋面粉
  　参加者有教职员工二千人
    【新华社陕北二十日电】北平消息（迟到）：在平津各大学学生反压迫反饥饿罢课高潮中，北大、清华及北平研究院七教育团体，已联合一致自本月六日起举行反饥饿联合罢教、罢研、罢工三天，争取续配两袋面粉及改善待遇。该七团体为北大的讲师助教联合会、职员公会、工警公会、清华的教联会、职员公会、工警联合会及北平研究院助理研究人员联合会。参加此项反饥饿斗争者计有讲师、助教五一七人，职员七六○人，工警八一○人，及北平研究院研究生四十人，共计二千余人。该七团体最近并发表“为争取合理待遇告社会人士书”及致蒋匪行政院与教育部“代电”。告社会人士书中称：“教育界同人生活的困顿不从今天起，而今天已到忍无可忍的地步。自从（蒋）政府一月份公布公教人员待遇调整办法以后，这个办法正面是按照所谓生活指数发薪，形式上“法币”的收入数量稍多一些，实际上收入反而大大减少。当局更拚命发行通货，促使物价狂涨，逼使我们和饥饿挣扎，受死亡威胁。反面则取消原来配面的办法，使我们难以维生。如此调整，岂不是残酷的嘲弄？几个月以来，教育界同人除了普遍的穷困，三餐不给，儿女啼饥号寒之外，有的弄得神经失常，以致疯狂；有的服毒、有的跳楼自杀。这些惨状，都彰彰在人耳目。我们要问：是谁让他们这样的？我们要大声的问：是谁把他们搞成这个样子？两个月以来，我们曾经一而再再而三的呼吁配面及调整薪给，唇也干了，笔也秃了，所得的答复是：一概不准。我们现在除采取积极行动以促使（蒋）政府接受外，已别无其他办法。我们认为我们的正当收入，已经为（蒋）政府用通货膨胀的方式征取了百分之九十以上，我们有权利要求（蒋）政府保证我们不虞饥饿的自由。我们希望能够得到社会人士和学生家长的同情与支持。”致蒋匪政府行政院及教育部代电中则要求下列各点：“（一）自三十七年二月份起，仍照一月份配售面粉之数量及价格继续按月配面，并实行配发其他生活必须品。（二）逐月按当地实际生活指数发薪，并提高技工及工警底薪，工警每人（底薪）不得少于二十元。（三）学术研究补助费，按实际生活指数逐月调整发给”。
