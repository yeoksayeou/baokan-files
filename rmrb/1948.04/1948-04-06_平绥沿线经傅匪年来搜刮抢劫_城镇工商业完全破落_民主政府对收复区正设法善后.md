Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 1st: Our reporter Yang Shuo reports: In just one year, the People's Liberation Army is again galloping across the vast lands of southern Chahar and along the Ping-Sui Railway. In the past year, the people of this area have suffered greatly under the tyranny of Bandit Fu, longing for the People's Liberation Army to liberate them as soon as possible. Fu Zuoyi's rule is truly the rule of bandits. Except for important towns, all his strongholds are made up of bandits he recruited, committing all kinds of atrocities, including rape and plunder, but they are still no match for his direct line troops. In Fu Jiabao village in Xuanhua, all the women, young and old, were raped, some as many as eight times in a single day. In Zhuolu and Shimenzi, all the grain and clothing were looted, and the entire villages were deserted. As for conscription, there were various tactics such as surrounding villages to round up people, snatching people on the road, and searching houses. In Wei County alone, more than 10,000 people were conscripted. In the southern mountains of Wei County, more than 6,000 people hid to avoid conscription.

Bandit Fu's grain requisition was calculated by the mu (unit of area), averaging two large dou (unit of volume) of millet per mu, or eight large dou per person. Added to the gun funds, police funds, and gift fees extorted by the large townships, it amounted to three large dou per mu, or one shi (unit of volume) and two dou per person. Although Wei County is a grain-producing area, the peasants now have no grain to eat. The industries and businesses in the towns have also been wiped out. Of the forty-eight shops in Nuanquan Town, only three or four remain.

The large townships are prisons for the people. The Economic Section is the grain-robbing section, specializing in grain robbery, with the power to break into people's homes at any time to rummage through boxes and cabinets and plunder property. The Civil Rights Section is the conscription section, specializing in conscription, with the power to arrest people everywhere. Each village also has a police officer. The common people have to pay 500 yuan every ten days to buy a road permit, otherwise they cannot leave the village. The young and strong are drilled every day, and the fields are barren, causing a serious disaster in Chahar last year. How to rehabilitate this devastated liberated area is an urgent problem. According to Zhang Su, Chairman of the Chahar Democratic Provincial Government, the government will immediately announce the abolition of all exorbitant taxes and levies, relieve the people of their heavy burdens, and issue agricultural loans to restore production. At the same time, it will unite all democratic classes and enlightened gentry, implement land reform in the countryside to eliminate feudalism, and confiscate bureaucratic capital in the towns to support private industry and commerce. Regarding the handling of all military, police, and government personnel of Bandit Fu, Zhang believes that "The People's Liberation Army has always only had public enemies, not private feuds. The democratic government adopts a lenient policy towards all coerced puppet soldiers, puppet police, and puppet organization personnel. As long as they repent and admit their mistakes, they will be forgiven for their past deeds and allowed to start anew. However, those who are willing to cling to the enemy and are the main culprits of the civil war with heinous crimes must be punished according to the law, and those who are stubbornly resisting to the end must be thoroughly eliminated." Zhang hopes that the villagers who have been liberated will do their utmost to support the front line, and hopes that the able-bodied men who have been captured by Bandit Fu and the compatriots who have fled to other places will quickly break away from the bandit gang, return to their hometowns, restore their families together, and unite with the People's Liberation Army to completely eliminate the Jiang-Fu bandit gang and liberate all of Chahar.

　　平绥沿线经傅匪年来搜刮抢劫
  　城镇工商业完全破落
    民主政府对收复区正设法善后
    【新华社晋察冀前线一日电】本社记者杨朔报导：不过一年，解放军又驰骋在察南和平绥沿线的辽阔土地上了。一年来，这一地区的人民受尽了傅匪的蹂躏，渴望解放军早日光复。傅作义的统治真是道地的土匪的统治，除重要城镇外，所有据点都是他招收的土匪，奸淫掳掠，无所不至，但还抵不上他的嫡系军队。宣化傅家堡全村妇女老老少少全被奸污，且有一天之内被奸八次的。涿鹿、石门子粮食衣物全部抢光，全村逃亡一空。至于抓丁有围村圈人，路上抢人，家里搜人等花样。仅蔚县一地抓走的即在万人以上。蔚县南部山里躲避抓丁的有六千多人。
    傅匪征粮是按亩算，每亩平均出小米二大斗，按人算则每人平均八大斗。加上大乡勒索的枪款、警款、送礼费等等合起来每亩三大斗，每人一石二斗。蔚县虽是产粮区，农民现在已经没粮吃。城镇的工商业，也是被一扫而空，暖泉镇四十八家商店，只剩了三、四家。
    大乡是人民的监牢，经济股是抢粮股专管抢粮，有权随时闯进人家翻箱倒柜，搜刮财物。民权股是抓丁股，专管抓兵，有权到处抓人。各村并有管警干事，老百姓每十天要向他化五百元买一张路条，否则不能出村一步。青壮年则每天操练，田野满目荒芜，造成去年察哈尔严重灾荒。对这一片满目创痍的收复区，如何善后，是当前迫切问题，据察省民主省政府主席张苏向记者称：政府将立即宣布取消一切苛捐杂税，解除人民重苛，并发放农贷恢复生产，同时将团结各民主阶层，开明士绅，在乡村实行土地改革，消灭封建，在城镇没收官僚资本，扶助私人工商业，对于傅匪之一切军警公务人员处理办法，张氏认为：“解放军从来只有公敌，没有私仇，民主政府对一切胁从的伪军伪警伪组织人员采取宽大政策，只要改过认错，一概不究既往，准其自新。但对甘心附逆，罪大恶极的内战主犯，要依法制裁，顽固不化抵抗到底的，要彻底消灭”。张氏希望已被解放的乡亲们，用全力支援前线，并希望被傅匪抓走的壮丁和逃亡异乡的同胞，迅速脱离匪帮，回到家乡，共同恢复家业，与解放军团结一致，彻底消灭蒋傅匪帮，解放全察哈尔。
