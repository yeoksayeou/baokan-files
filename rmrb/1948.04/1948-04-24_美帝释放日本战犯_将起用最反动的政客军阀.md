Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Shanghai Dispatch: Recently, detailed news has emerged here regarding the plan of U.S. imperialism to foster the revival of a Japanese warlord regime. Moreover, this activity of the United States has established a special connection with the Chiang Kai-shek government. According to reliable sources, MacArthur Headquarters, in order to establish a government in Japan that completely meets the needs of U.S. imperialism, has obtained the approval of the U.S. government and is now planning to bring out the most reactionary politicians and warlords in Japan to organize such a government. For this purpose, MacArthur Headquarters has held negotiations with former Japanese Prime Ministers Ugaki, Waka, Okada, Yonai, and former Liberal Party leader Hatoyama. It is said that during the negotiations, these Japanese reactionary ringleaders, in addition to welcoming this plan, also requested that the sentences of Tojo and others be reduced, and that other war criminals such as Ando, ​​Nishio, Tada, and Shimomura be released. This request has been approved by the U.S. side, so war criminals such as Nishio and Tada have now been released, and in accordance with the instructions of the U.S. military headquarters, Japan is conducting propaganda to restore the social status of this group of reactionary warlords and politicians. Through the introduction of MacArthur Headquarters, representatives of the Japanese warlords have established close ties with the Chiang Kai-shek government. Among them, the relationship between Hatoyama and the representative of the Chiang government stationed in Japan is particularly noteworthy. It is said that Hatoyama's expenses for this activity amount to 500,000 yen per month. Under the same reactionary goal, the Black Dragon Society, a well-known fascist terrorist group in Japan that was formally dispersed, is now actively launching activities under the instructions of MacArthur Headquarters.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Tokyo Dispatch: When Japan's number one war criminal, Hideki Tojo, made his final defense on the 9th, his American defense lawyer, Bluwett, still attempted to whitewash Tojo's aggressive atrocities. Mr. Bluett repeatedly and shamelessly clamored that Japan launched the Pacific War out of "self-defense and self-preservation," and attempted to use the Japanese invaders' "acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration" as a basis for relieving and forgiving the Japanese invaders' crimes.

　　美帝释放日本战犯
  　将起用最反动的政客军阀
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】上海讯：最近此间关于美帝扶植日本军阀政权复活的计划，又有详细的消息。并且美国此项活动，已与蒋介石政府建立了特殊的联系。据可靠方面传出，麦克阿瑟总部为了要在日本建立完全符合美国帝国主义需要的政府，已经获得美国政府的批准，现正计划搬出日本最反动的政客和军阀，来组织这样的政府。为此目的，麦克阿瑟总部曾和前日本首相宇垣、若＠、冈田、米内等以及前自由党首领鸠山进行了谈判。据称：在谈判中，这些日本反动派首脑除欢迎这一计划外，并要求减轻对东条等的处分，和释放其他战犯如安藤、西尾、多田、下村等人。此项要求已获得美方同意，故西尾、多田等战犯现已释放，并依照美军总部的指示，日本已在进行恢复这批反动军阀政客社会地位的宣传。由于麦克阿瑟总部的介绍，日本军阀代表与蒋介石政府已经取得密切联系。其中鸠山与蒋政府驻日代表的关系尤堪注目。鸠山由于此项活动的费用，据传每月达五十万日元之谱。在同一反动目标下，形式上已经分散的日本著名法西斯恐怖团体——黑龙会，现亦在麦克阿瑟总部的指示下，积极展开活动。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】东京讯：日本头号战犯东条英矶九日作最后一次之狡辩时，美籍辩护律师布鲁威特仍妄图为东条粉饰侵略暴行。布氏一再无耻叫嚣称：日本发动太平洋战争系出于“自卫与自保”，并图以日寇“接受波茨坦声明”一事，作为卸却和宽恕日寇罪行之根据。
