The Kuomintang bandit Wang Kuang, commander of the 113th Brigade of the Nationalist 51st Division, along with his two regiments, were shelled by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for two days and three nights at Yilin (70 li southwest of Funing). Reinforcements never arrived, and the despicable use of poison gas three times could not save them from their doomed fate. On the night of the 18th, when PLA soldiers completely broke through his last line of defense, this brigade commander, who just minutes before had been mindlessly ordering "hold to the death," seemed to finally wake up. He scrambled out of his bunker, intending to escape in the confusion. But he didn't get far before being captured by PLA soldier Ren Jiaji. Ren Jiaji asked him what rank he was. He trembled and fabricated an official title, saying, "I'm a literary officer, a... a... an upper lieutenant scribe, I just write for people, I wouldn't lie." He even pulled out his pen and stuffed it into Ren Jiaji's hand, repeatedly saying, "Let's be friends, let's be friends." Ren Jiaji refused and said, "The PLA treats prisoners of war well, officers too, with leniency across the board." He then sent him to the PLA officer and soldier reception area, where he stayed overnight. The next day, when questioned again, Wang Kuang still insisted, "Literary officer, literary officer," but his liberated subordinates had already come forward to testify. So, he quickly took off his hat, bowed deeply, and said, "I'm sorry! I'm sorry! My name is Wang Kuang, I am the commander of the 113th Brigade."

    Story of the Annihilation of Kuomintang Bandits in Zhoucun

    When the PLA's spearhead suddenly extended to the western section of the Jiaoji Railway, Zhou Qingxiang, commander of the Nationalist 32nd Division, a confidant personally promoted by the bandit Wang Yaowu, was still in a daze. The division was scattered in six or seven places, with the division's direct units stationed in Zhoucun City. But upon hearing the news of the PLA's gathering around Guangrao and Boxing, Zhou Qingxiang was terrified and frantically called his chief of staff, Li Xiyu, to call Wang Yaowu for help. Unexpectedly, he was scolded in the phone, accused of "reporting false military intelligence," and warned, "If you report carelessly without verifying the situation in the future, I will have your head!" Later, as the PLA drew closer and closer, Zhou Qingxiang repeatedly sent reports requesting reinforcements, but Wang Yaowu still said, "It is estimated that the Communist army is covering the transport of supplies across the Yellow River." But the PLA's heavy artillery was already thundering outside Zhoucun City.

    On the 12th, the PLA launched a general offensive against Zhoucun City. The soldiers of a battalion of the 422nd Regiment of the 141st Brigade of the Nationalist 32nd Division, besieged in the south of the city, had no heart to fight. As the PLA's gunfire drew closer and closer, the battalion's soldiers asked the battalion commander, "What do we do?" The battalion commander, like his subordinates, couldn't wait to surrender, but he was hindered by the brigade chief of staff, Fang Renjie, who was supervising the battle at the regimental level. So he reported to the regimental headquarters, "The ranks are already in disarray!" The regimental commander, a miscellaneous army officer, also knew what everyone meant, but didn't dare to speak. Everyone's eyes were on the brigade chief of staff, who was the only one who could make a decision. He stammered and asked, "Is there any way out?" The company and platoon leaders replied in unison, "There are two options: surrender, or break out. But if we break out, no one can guarantee the chief of staff's safety." The chief of staff turned pale, looked at everyone, and remained silent. Thus, more than four hundred people laid down their weapons under the power of the PLA's artillery fire.

    Fang Renjie, mixed in with the captured lieutenant officers, was dressed in a soldier's uniform, covered in mud and dirt, and had even pulled down the earflaps of his cotton military cap to cover his face, squatting in a corner, afraid to speak up. At this moment, Wang Qing, a seventeen-year-old orderly from the first battalion of the 423rd Regiment, walked over. He had been conscripted last year at the Xuchang railway station where he was selling cigarettes, and now that he was liberated, he wanted revenge. He walked up to Fang Renjie with a smile and said, "The regimental commander asked me to invite the chief of staff to speak." Fang Renjie turned pale upon hearing this, but he jumped up and pretended to be calm, threatening, "Who says I'm the chief of staff? Did you appoint me?" Wang Qing curled his lips and pointed at him, saying, "Now is not the time for you to put on airs. I was conscripted by you for nine months, don't you think I know a chief of staff when I see one?" Fang Renjie knew he couldn't hide it anymore, turned his head and admitted to the PLA comrades, "I am the acting chief of staff." The captured officers around him burst into laughter. Fang Renjie's face turned red and white, and finally, he lowered his head and reluctantly admitted that he was the chief of staff of the 141st Brigade.

　　王匡就擒记
    蒋匪整五十一师一一三旅旅长王匡带着他的两个团，在益林（阜宁西南七十里）挨了解放军两天三夜的大炮，援兵终于没有赶来，卑鄙地施放了三次毒瓦斯也没有挽救得了覆没的命运。十八日夜里，当解放军勇士完全突破他最后的防线时，这个几分钟以前还昏头昏脑下令“死守”的旅长，才仿佛清醒过来，慌忙爬出掩蔽部，打算趁着混乱逃走。但并没有走多远，就被解放军战士任家骥捉住了。任家骥问他是什么官。他哆嗦着胡诌了一个官名说：“我是文墨官，是…是…是上尉司书，就是跟人家写字的，我不会说谎。”并拔下钢笔塞到任家骥手里，连连说：“咱们交个朋友，咱们交个朋友。”任家骥拒绝了，并且说：“解放军优待俘虏，当官的也是一样，一律宽大。”说着把他送到解放官兵招待处，他在那里住了一夜。第二天再问他时，王匡还是满口：“文墨官，文墨官”，可是他的解放了的部下，已出面来作证。于是，他连忙脱下帽子，深深鞠了一躬说：“对不起！对不起！我就叫王匡，我就是一一三旅的旅长。”
    周村蒋匪被歼故事
    当解放军的矛头突然伸向胶济西段时，王匪耀武一手提拔起来的亲信整三十二师师长周庆祥还如在梦中，一个师分散在六、七处，周村市驻着师的直属队。但是当一听到广饶博兴一带我军集结的消息后，周庆祥就吓得团团乱转，立刻叫参谋长李锡煜打电话向王耀武求救，不料电话中挨了一顿臭骂，说他“谎报军情”，并声言：“今后如不把情况查明就乱报告，要杀你的头！”其后解放军已愈逼愈近，周庆祥接二连三打报告请援，可是王耀武还说：“估计共军是掩护辎重过黄河去”。但解放军的巨炮已在周村外市轰响了。
    解放军十二日向周村市发动总攻，困守市南的蒋匪整三十二师一四一旅四二二团一个营的士兵皆已无心作战，当解放军的枪愈打愈近时，该营士兵就找着营长问：“怎么办？”营长也和下面一样巴不得快投降，但碍着在团里督战的旅参谋长方人杰，于是就到团部里报告：“下面已经乱了！”团长是杂牌军官，也早知道大家的意思，但是又不敢讲话，大家都把眼光望着唯一能作主的旅参谋长。他呐呐的问道：“有没有一点办法？”营连长们同声回答：“办法有两个，一个是投降，一个是突围，可是突围大家不敢保证参谋长的安全。”这位参谋长吓白了脸，望望大家，默不作声，就这样四百多人在解放军炮火的威力下放下了武器。
    混在俘虏尉官队里的方人杰穿着一身士兵衣服，满身弄得又泥又脏，还把棉军帽的耳朵放下来遮着面孔，蹲在一个角落里不敢声张，这时四二三团一营的十七岁勤务员王清走了过来，他是去年在许昌车站上卖香烟被抓来的，这次被解放后，他要报仇。他笑嘻嘻的走上去对方人杰说：“团长叫我请参谋长讲话。”方人杰一听吓白了脸，但还跳起来假作镇静的威胁说：“谁说我是参谋长，是你封我吗？”王清把嘴一呶，指着他说：“现在可不是你摆官架子的时候了，我被你们抓来当了九个月兵，连你是个参谋长也不认识了吗？”方人杰知道瞒不住了，掉转头向解放军同志承认道：“我是代理参谋长”。围在左右的俘虏军官听了都大笑起来，方人杰的脸一阵红一阵白，最后他低下头来很难为情的承认了是一四一旅的参谋长。
