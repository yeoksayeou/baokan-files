Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Rome dispatch: On the eve of the Italian elections, over 100,000 people held a grand mass meeting here on the 16th. The meeting was a sea of people, with cheers resounding through the sky and hundreds of banners waving everywhere. Some banners read: "May Galeazzo and Christ be with us forever!" "Death to Gasperi and Cardinal Schuster!" "The People's Democratic Front will sweep away Gasperi!" Amidst thunderous applause, Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti began his speech. He said in a firm tone: "After April 18th, Italy will have a coalition government, an alliance of all people's democratic and national forces to save freedom, preserve peace, and defend the right of the Italian people to survive. We have already won in the election campaign, this is our first great victory, but we should be vigilant, not afraid of intimidation, not deceived, and avoid arrogance and rashness. There is no need to confront the police and police officers, because they are only acting under orders, and even they do not approve of the reactionaries' orders. We must remain calm and confident." Togliatti then refuted the Italian reactionary Interior Minister Scelba's狂吠 (“If irregularities (?) occur, the election will be stopped”)狂吠 and stated: "No minister and no government has the power to take such steps. Any provocation aimed at undermining the freedom of elections can be avoided by the composure, calmness, and strong will of all citizens." It is also reported that when Togliatti spoke in Naples on the 15th, the number of people attending reached 125,000. The American and Italian reactionaries dispatched two small planes to circle over the venue, distributing anti-communist leaflets, attempting to threaten the participants. At that time, the indignant masses "raised their heads and waved their fists at the sky." (United Press)

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Comprehensive report: On the eve of the Italian elections, the conspiracy between U.S. imperialism and the Italian reactionaries to collude and undermine the democratic elections is becoming more despicable and blatant, leading to increasingly sharp struggles between the two major camps in Italy. According to a Washington dispatch from an Italian Post reporter: A squadron of U.S. Superfortress bombers will fly over Italy on the 18th, the day of the election, to conduct an intimidating demonstration. Additionally, according to a TASS dispatch on the 15th: U.S. and British warships have been gathering in the port of Venice since the 9th. At the same time, 13,000 tons of U.S. military equipment (mostly machine guns, rifles, etc.) have recently arrived at Italian ports. The interference of U.S. imperialism has become shameless to this extent: in broad daylight, a person wearing a People's Democratic Front armband on a main street in downtown Rome was beaten up by three American soldiers, who also attempted to tear off his armband. The Italian reactionaries are making a final struggle. They are instigating fascist bandits everywhere to provoke and kill people, and are extensively ostracizing and arresting democrats. Recently, Sforza has dismissed the Italian ambassador to Poland, namely the People's Democratic Front candidate for senator in the Rome district, Durini, and prohibited democratic leaders of foreign missions from participating in the election. *Repubblica* revealed that Sforza's move was intended to prevent Durini from participating in the election and to remove a thorn in his side. However, such heinous acts by the U.S. imperialists and the Italian reactionaries have been met with the deserved response from the Italian people; and have further heightened their vigilance. According to Agence France-Presse on the 12th: dockworkers in Genoa firmly refused to unload munitions on ships supplying the reactionaries, saying angrily: "We cannot supply the police with the munitions to fire on our workers." The Secretariat of the Italian People's Democratic Front has recently called on branches in various regions to be vigilant against the conspiracies of the Italian reactionaries and resolutely expose them. The call stated: Reactionary groups may engage in provocations in order to persecute democratic organizations and thwart the election.

　　罗马十万群众大会
  　意共号召沉着进行竞选斗争
    美帝无耻竟以武力作恫吓性示威
    【新华社陕北十九日电】罗马讯：意大选前夕，此间十余万人于十六日举行盛大的群众大会。会上人山人海，群众欢呼之声响彻云霄，成百标语旗帜到处飞舞，有些旗上写着：“愿加黎波的及基督常在！”“加斯贝利及舒斯克红衣主教该死！”“人民民主阵线将扫除加斯贝利！”在掌声雷动中，意共领袖托格里亚蒂即起演说，他以坚定的语调说：“意大利在四月十八日后，将出现一个联合政府，这是一切人民民主与民族力量拯救自由、挽救和平并保卫意大利人民生存权利的联盟。我们已在竞选斗争中获胜，这是我们第一个大胜利，但应该警惕，不怕恫吓、不受欺骗，戒骄戒躁。不必去对抗警察和警官，因为他们只是奉令行事，甚至他们亦并不赞成反动派的命令。我们必须保持安静并具有信心。”托氏继驳斥意反动内长谢尔巴“如发生舞弊（？），即停止选举”之狂吠称：“任何部长和任何政府都没有权力采取那样的步骤，一切旨在破坏选举自由的挑衅，可以用所有公民的沉着、镇静与坚强意志来避免。”又讯：托格里亚蒂于十五日在那不勒斯演讲时，到会群众达十二万五千人，美意反动派曾出动两架小型飞机，在会场上空盘旋，散发反共传单，妄图以此威胁与会群众，当时义愤填膺的群众，“仰首举拳向天空挥动。”（合众社）
    【新华社陕北十八日电】综合报导：意大选前夕，美帝与意国反动派互相勾结破坏民主大选的阴谋，更卑鄙而明目张胆，致意国两大阵营的斗争愈益尖锐。据意邮报记者华盛顿讯：美超级空中堡垒一中队将于十八日大选时飞越意上空，作恫吓性的示威。另据塔斯社十五日讯：美英舰船自九日以来正云集威尼斯港。同时，美一万三千吨军事装备（其中多为机枪、步枪等）亦于最近运抵意港口。美帝的干涉已无耻到这个地步：罗马市中心大街一佩带人民民主阵线臂章的人民，在光天化日之下遭三个美国兵毒打，并图撕去其臂章。意反动派则正在作最后的挣扎。在各地嗾使法西斯匪徒到处挑衅杀人，并大肆排斥与拘捕民主人士。最近史佛卓已将意驻波大使即罗马区人民民主阵线参议员候选人杜尼尼撤职，并禁止驻外使节的民主领袖参加竞选。共和报揭露史佛卓此举目的是拟阻止杜氏参加竞选，并拔除其眼中钉。但美帝及意反动派此种穷凶极恶的行径，已遭受意国人民的应有回击；并更提高了他们的警觉。据法新社十二日讯：热那亚装卸货工人坚拒卸下供给反动派的船只上的军火，他们愤怒的说：“我们不能把向我们工人开火的军火供给警察。”意人民民主阵线书记处日前已号召各地支部对意反动派阴谋提高警惕，并坚决揭发之。号召内称：反动集团可能进行挑衅，借此来迫害民主组织，并使大选遭受挫折。
