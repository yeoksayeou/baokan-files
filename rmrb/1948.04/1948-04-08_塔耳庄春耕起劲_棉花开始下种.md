　　Tar Village's Spring Cultivation is in Full Swing
  　Cotton Planting Begins
    [Shexian News] Since receiving the border government's proclamation of "Secure spring cultivation, whoever sows, reaps," Tar Village in the Second District has been publicizing it to the masses and holding discussions in the civil schools, putting everyone at ease. In particular, the middle-peasant households are in higher spirits for production. Now many middle-peasant households in the village are building houses. For example, Jia Tianshun has already built a donkey pen (one room), and four other middle-peasant households are also preparing wood and stone to build houses. In addition, from February 12th to 22nd, except for the women weaving at home, all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the village went to the fields to build embankments and cultivate fallow land, accomplishing a lot. Currently, the whole village has planted 725 trees and repaired 48 mu of river滩. This year, more than 20 mu can be planted with rice (with plans to repair a total of more than 100 mu). The whole village has already planted 10 mu and 5 fen of cotton (not including what is currently being planted). Wang Yide, who is over sixty years old, returned from the fields at dusk. Hearing that there was some manure on the road on the upper bend, he grabbed a bowl and went out in the dark to pick it up, returning only after everyone was asleep, having collected a basket of donkey manure. Someone asked him, "Why did you go out in the dark to pick up manure?" He said, "I was afraid someone else would pick it up..." Currently, production work in the whole village is underway.
    Nangang Village in the Ninth District, after announcing the "whoever sows, reaps" message during the reorganization of mutual aid on the 16th and 17th, spring cultivation in the whole village began to move. An investigation revealed that 89 lower-middle and poor peasant households were having difficulties with farm tools and food, lacking 83 pieces of farm tools such as plows. In addition, 23 households had no food to eat. Immediately, 690 jin of wheat were borrowed from the farmers' association's grain reserves and 552 jin of millet from the village's public property were lent to the 23 households who had no food to eat. After these difficulties were resolved, everyone's enthusiasm for production was great. Now, the thinking of the middle peasants in the whole village has also been resolved. Embankment for sending fertilizer is completed, and they are cultivating cotton fields, preparing to plant cotton.

　　塔耳庄春耕起劲
  　棉花开始下种
    【涉县消息】二区塔耳庄村，自接到边府发出的安心春耕谁种谁收的布告后，就向群众宣传、并在民校里让群众讨论，大家安下心来，特别是中农户，生产情绪更高，现在全村中农不少都盖房子。如贾天顺已盖了一个驴圈（一间），还有四户中农也预备木石打算盖房。另外从二月十二日到二十二日，全村除了妇女在家纺织外，全半劳力都到地里去＠堰边，耕垡地，做出了很多生活。现全村共栽树七百二十五棵，修河滩四十八亩，今年能种稻子的二十余亩（打算共修一百余亩）。全村现已经下种的棉花是十亩零五分（现正在下种的未计在内）。六十余岁的王义德，傍黑从地回来，听说上弯路上有些粪，便撩下碗搭黑去拾，直至人都睡了才回来，拾了一箩头驴肥。有人问他你为啥搭黑去拾粪呢？他说，怕别人拾了……。现全村生产工作，正在进行着。
    九区南岗村，在十六七号整顿互助时，将谁种谁收消息念后，全村春耕开始动起来了。从调查中发现下中农贫农八十九户，农具、吃喝都有困难，计缺乏农具犁等八十三件；另有二十三户没吃的。当即向农会存粮内借出麦子六百九十斤，村公产黍子五百五十二斤，借给当下没吃的二十三户。这些困难解决后，大家生产劲头很大。现在全村中农思想也解决了，堰边送粪已完成，正在耕棉花地，准备种花。
