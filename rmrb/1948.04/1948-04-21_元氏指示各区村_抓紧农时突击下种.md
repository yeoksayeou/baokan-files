　　Yuanshi Directs All Districts and Villages
  　Seize the Farming Season and Rush to Sow Seeds
    [Yuanshi News] The disaster in Yuanshi is severe, and the victims face extreme difficulties in life and production. After the government provided grain loans, relief with bran and vegetables, and supported the victims in carrying out a self-salvation production movement, great achievements have been made. More than 20,000 disaster victims in the county have received grain and money to maintain their lives and invest in production. However, among cadres and some of the masses, some blindly optimistic and complacent sentiments have grown, thinking that the disaster is not a major problem. The county leadership believes that this is not planning for the long term and fails to recognize the development of the disaster. If it is not overcome in time, it will cause a great crime against the victims. A special instruction was given to all cadres and the masses to be seriously vigilant. It also pointed out that the previous stage of production and famine relief work focused on handicraft textile, sideline production, small business, and indiscriminate cutting. This played a significant role in organizing disaster victims to overcome the famine. However, from the current perspective, Qingming has passed, and it is necessary to switch to agricultural production in a timely manner. Taking advantage of the rain, we should urgently mobilize and rush to sow early-maturing crops. However, handicraft production and sideline production must be carried out in conjunction. Cadres should quickly help poor and hired peasants solve the difficulties of land use rights, livestock, seeds, and farm tools. Based on past customs, they should organize temporary small-scale mutual assistance and partnerships to enable peasants to carry out production in an organized manner, but resolutely overcome the bad phenomena of administrative orders and forced compilation.
    In order to overcome spontaneous flows, it is necessary to establish a unified leadership organization. The county has determined that a dedicated person is responsible, and each district is responsible by the guidance group, and a dedicated person is responsible for production and disaster relief work. Each village should immediately elect and establish a "Spring Farming Production Committee" to lead the spring farming production and disaster relief movement. (Bingzhang, Shichang)

　　元氏指示各区村
  　抓紧农时突击下种
    【元氏消息】元氏灾荒严重，灾民在生活和生产上，存在着极大的困难，经过政府贷粮贷款，救济糠菜，扶植灾民开展生产自救运动，近已取得很大成绩，全县两万余灾民，得到粮款得以维持生活，投入生产。但在干部和一部分群众中，又滋长了些盲目乐观和自满情绪，认为灾荒不大要紧了。县领导上认为这样不从长期打算，不认识灾荒的发展，如不及时克服，将会造成对灾民的莫大罪恶。特指示所有干部群众，严重警惕。并指出前段的生产渡荒工作，偏重手工业纺织，副业生产，干小买卖和胡扑砍，这在组织灾民渡荒上起了很大作用。但从当前看来，清明已过，须及时转入农业生产，趁雨后有垧应紧急动员起来，进行突击下种，种早熟庄稼。但手工业生产和副业生产必须结合进行。干部应迅速的帮助贫雇农民解决土地的使用权和牲口、种籽、农具等困难，依据过去习惯，组织临时的小型互助和打伙计伙干活，以便使农民有组织的进行生产，但坚决要克服行政命令，强行编制的恶劣现象。
    为了克服自流现象，须要建立统一的领导组织，县已确定有专人负责，各区由指导组负责，并责成一个专人负责生产救灾工作。各村要马上民选建立“春耕生产委员会”，领导春耕生产救灾运动。（秉章、世昌）
