　　Xiuwu Local Troops Alert and Agile
　　Repeatedly Annihilating Chiang Kai-shek Bandits on the Jiaozuo-Daiwang Road
　　[Our News] Since the 10th of this month, the armed forces of the West Joint Defense of Xiuwu First District have launched proactive attacks against the enemy on the Jiaozuo-Daiwang Highway. On the dawn of the 12th, the enemy from Qianzhuang went to Baijianfang to prepare an ambush. After being discovered by our scouts, we organized a small force to outflank the enemy from the side. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy retreated in a panic to Qianji. We then organized crack troops to operate on the highway. As soon as they moved out, they encountered two enemies and a large cart coming face to face. After a loud shout from us, the enemy was stunned and obediently surrendered, men and cart together.
　　After the victory of the previous battle, another battle was planned. We had the clothing of the liberated soldiers changed and worn by the bold and brave comrades of our Public Security Team's reconnaissance platoon. Cooperating with the camp's rotation team, under the personal leadership of Comrade Zhao Fuquan, the head of the Public Security Section, they disguised themselves as enemy officers and swaggered from west to east on the highway. On the Jinzuo South Ground Highway, they encountered a squad of the enemy protecting the road, posing as the 11th Company of the 4th Battalion of the Xiuwu Security Regiment. After the sentry asked about the situation, they ordered the enemy person in charge to come forward. Comrade Zhao Fuquan, in disguise, severely scolded the enemy squad leader, saying he was irresponsible for losing the cart. After getting close, Comrade Fuquan grabbed the enemy squad leader, and the other comrades pounced, leaving no one to escape. The enemy even tried to resist stubbornly, and the squad leader and squad leader below were killed or wounded on the spot, five people in total, seven captured. Only one person escaped. Eight rifles, one machine gun, and more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. The battle lasted five minutes, and we had no casualties. The comrades who participated in this battle were alert and agile, and their continuous and tenacious fighting style is worthy of study by all armed forces. (Xiuwu County Command)
