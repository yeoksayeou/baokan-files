　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Reports from various sources: The Italian people have risen up to oppose the extreme interference and provocations by the US-Italian reactionaries and the Vatican against the general election. The working class in Northern Italy, starting from March 30th, has launched widespread strikes and demonstrations to protest against Gasperi's violent actions against the People's Democratic Front's election campaign. Workers in cities such as Codogno, Casalpusterlengo, Urlando, and Somalia have joined this wave. Demonstrators in Somalia angrily chased a fascist named Anieri, shouting, "Punish this country fascist!" Workers in all factories in Sicily went on strike for twenty minutes on the 2nd to mourn Cangilosi, the local branch secretary of the agricultural workers' union who was murdered on the 1st; and expressed their angry protests to the reactionary authorities. Interior Minister Shelba was forced to dismiss the police chief of Sicily. On the 3rd, the People's Democratic Front sent a letter to the Pope in Rome, protesting the Church's interference in the election; and angrily rebuked, "The Church has never been as determined to fight the Nazis as it is now to deal with the People's Democratic Front." The Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party demanded on the 1st that Gasperi stop the indiscriminate issuance of "American letters forcing people to vote in the general election." The people expressed disgust and contempt for the election campaigns of Gasperi's followers everywhere. According to an Associated Press report from Rome: "A right-wing speaker was thrown off the stage into the crowd." According to a United Press report: "The right-wing election campaign encountered difficulties on the evening of the 2nd. In Arezzo, a city in the province of Florence, a speaker was booed off the stage; in the city of Florence, a monarchist was so ridiculed that he had to interrupt his speech; the Minister of Merchant Marine Gaba (a Christian Democrat) was booed throughout his speech in Venice."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Rome dispatch: Italian Communist leader Togliatti, returning from a trip to Southern Italy on the 4th, spoke with confidence about the intensified interference by US imperialism and the frenzied provocations by fascists, saying: The People's Democratic Front "will still win the election on April 18th. No violent action can stop the democratic forces from winning." He said excitedly: "My short trip to the southern provinces of Italy gave me a strong impression. In these provinces, I saw a fundamental change in the views of the working masses, who are no longer succumbing to the old ruling class and are now united with progressive democratic parties. This is a decisive turning point in our country's history. If we succeed in strengthening these new strongholds of progressive democracy in Southern Italy—and we will succeed—then Italy will certainly achieve victory in the cause of progress and social justice." Togliatti finally pointed out: "The South will fight side by side with the North, and the South will give the People's Democratic Front millions of votes, which will enable the People's Democratic Front to gain political leadership in our country."

　　意人民抗议美意反动派阻扰竞选
    广泛展开罢工与示威
    意共领袖称大选中人民必胜
    【新华社陕北八日电】各方讯：意大利人民群起反对美意反动派及梵蒂冈对大选穷凶极恶的干涉与挑衅。意北工人阶级于上月三十日起，更广泛地展开了罢工与示威运动，以抗议加斯贝利对人民民主阵线竞选的暴力行动，卷入这一浪潮的有科多诺、加沙普、乌尔兰多及索马利亚等城工人。索马利亚的示威者愤怒地追捕一个名叫安尼里士的法西斯分子，示威者边追边喊：“惩罚这个乡下法西斯分子！”西西里一切工厂的工人于二日全体停工二十分钟，哀悼于一日遇害的农业工人工会地方分会书记堪吉洛茜；并对反动当局表示愤怒的抗议。内长谢尔巴被迫不得不将西西里警察局长撤职。人民民主阵线于三日致函罗马教皇，抗议教会干涉选举；并怒责“教会从未象现在对付人民民主阵线一样坚定去和纳粹作战过。”意共及社会党一日要求加斯贝利停止滥发“迫令人民在大选中如何投票的美国信件。”人民对加斯贝利党徒在各地的竞选，表示憎恶与唾弃。据美联社罗马电说：“一个右翼讲演者被从讲演台上摔进人群。”另据合众社说：“二日晚右翼竞选运动遭遇困难。在佛罗伦萨省的阿累佐城，一个演说者被嘘下了讲演台；在佛罗伦萨市，一个保皇主义者被讥刺得那样厉害，以致中断了他的演说；商航部长加巴（按基督教民主党人）在威尼斯演说，全场报以一片嘘声。”
    【新华社陕北八日电】罗马讯：意共领袖托格里亚蒂四日从意大利南部旅行归来，他在谈及美帝加紧干涉及法西斯疯狂挑衅时，满怀信心地说：人民民主阵线“仍将在四月十八日的大选中赢得胜利。任何暴力行动都阻止不了民主势力要获胜”。他兴奋的说：“在意南各省的短短旅行中，给我一个强烈的印象。我在这些省份里，看到了劳苦大众意见的根本变化，他们不再屈服于旧的统治阶级，目前正与进步的民主政党团结一致，这是我国历史中有决定性的转捩点。假如我们在加强意南进步民主的这些新强大堡垒上获得成功，——我们也不会不成功——那么意大利将在进步与社会正义的事业中确定地取得胜利。”托氏最后指出：“南方将与北方并肩斗争，南方将给人民民主阵线成百万张选票，而这将使人民民主阵线在我国获得政治上的领导地位。”
