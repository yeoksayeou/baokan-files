　　Promoting Democracy and Implementing Leadership: Sanwang Village Distributes Land Based on Production
　　[Our dispatch] When the Sanwang Village of the Ninth District of Wu'an was still at the height of party rectification, the work team began preparing for land redistribution. The Farmers' Association Committee sent three people, and invited two others familiar with the village's land conditions, to form a land survey team. The village has 195 households with a current population of 716, with 23 people living elsewhere. There are a total of 2,182 mu of land, yielding 4,415 small shi of grain. Including those living elsewhere, the average land per person is 2.9 mu, yielding 5.9 dou of grain. Among them, poor peasants own an average of 5.4 dou of grain per person, new middle peasants 5.8 dou, and old middle peasants 7.2 dou. If the average yield of 5.9 dou is used to equalize land ownership, it will inevitably affect all the old middle peasants' surplus. If the average yield is lowered to 5.7 dou, only about 180 mu of land will need to be redistributed. The village can potentially redistribute 4.2 mu of school land, 6.1 mu of land belonging to households without heirs, 51.2 mu of land belonging to those who have been living elsewhere for more than ten years and are confirmed not to be returning, 32 mu of land over-occupied by cadres that can be returned, and 19 mu of land that can be returned from those who gained too much land since the anti-traitor liquidation, a difference of only around 60 mu. Therefore, it was decided to implement redistribution on a smaller scale, and to begin immediately after the second class designation was completed (March 21).

　　At the beginning, the Farmers' Association小组(small group) first discussed and assessed the shortcomings self-reported by each individual, and then brought them to the street congress for evaluation. There was a lot of debate at the street congress, especially regarding houses. Zhang Zhengben wanted a house, and someone said: "You have two cows, a donkey, and thirty sheep, and you have labor. Just give you some wood and stone to repair the house." So, if someone wanted a house, they all wanted to build it themselves, regardless of whether they were poor or middle peasants, or whether they could afford it. Middle peasants had both good and bad land. Li Bingfang wanted to exchange for good land, and someone said: "You have two mu of orchard, and also 1.2 mu of Nangang (place name) and 1.3 mu of Shibamu (place name) of good land. You still want to exchange? Who will farm the bad land?" Even poor peasants with only bad land were not allowed to exchange, saying, "If he can't exchange, why should you be able to exchange?" Bargaining and the idea of absolute equalitarianism were very strong.

　　Conducting Redistribution Education to Overcome Absolute Equalitarianism
　　So, the next day, a special redistribution education was conducted. To make it easier to concentrate opinions, only a joint meeting of the Farmers' Association Committee and小组(small group) leaders was held. At the beginning, when talking about who should be filled, someone said: "Whoever has the biggest hole should be filled." Someone said: "The households who were struggled against have the biggest holes and should be filled first." Poor peasant woman Bao Di said: "Regardless of who is filled, we must look at their class. After looking at the class, then look at their hole." At this time, the two basic principles of land reform, meeting the demands of poor and hired peasants and uniting middle peasants, were read and explained, and then guided discussion. Opinions gradually concentrated. Finally, Bao Di's proposition of "look at the class first, then look at the hole" was adopted as the decision, clarifying the concept that the demands of poor and hired peasants must be met first. Then, the issue of where to redistribute from was discussed. The redistribution小组(small group) reported to everyone about the family assets they had identified, allowing everyone to understand the situation, and then read the five principles of uniting middle peasants and the redistribution principles of the first category of areas, encouraging them to discuss. Because everyone understood the family assets and knew that the redistribution could be done well even without affecting the middle peasants, the opinions towards the middle peasants were very mild. Everyone admitted that only what the middle peasants voluntarily gave up could be taken. However, some individuals had somewhat radical emotions towards those who had turned over too much, such as saying "give those who turned over too much some barren land to till," (meaning to take back all their land and give them some barren land) "if they have labor, give them barren land." But they were immediately rebutted. At this time, it was pointed out that letting them till barren land was disregarding the overall situation, and targeting similar ideas, it was emphasized that redistribution was the peasants' own reorganization of their household affairs, and it should be fair and reasonable, take ownership, consider the overall situation, and be responsible for identifying family assets. Later, the same education was conducted again at the poor peasant小组(small group) meeting, inspiring them to play a backbone role in household matters.

　　After the third class designation, separate meetings of middle peasants and poor peasants were held. For middle peasants, it was emphasized that poor and hired peasants must be taken care of (middle peasants dominate in this village), and they were mobilized to return land that they had over-occupied or bought cheaply. Those who had gained too much fruit all stated on the spot: "In the past, we doubled and tripled the harvest, and we bought what we shouldn't have bought. Now we must return it." Most new middle peasants also said: "We must look back at what life was like before. We must return the land we gained too much." As a result, a total of 19.15 mu were returned (excluding cadres and party members, because they had already returned their land when the party rectification began). For poor peasants, the principles of satisfying the poor and hired peasants' liberation and consolidating the unity of middle peasants were emphasized once again.

　　After repeated discussions, it was time for specific allocation, but if the小组(small group) were allowed to continue unlimited discussion, it would prolong the allocation process. Therefore, it was decided that the Farmers' Association Committee would handle this matter, with nine representatives from the小组(small group) and all those who needed to be filled (the list was evaluated by the小组(small group) and the street congress) jointly evaluating and allocating. It took two full days of evaluation. During the evaluation, there was generally no dispute. Only a few individuals disregarded the overall situation, wanting good land on top of good land, and insisting on returning bad land before they would accept it. However, these opinions were opposed by the masses. As for the order of allocation, poor peasants were allocated first, followed by middle peasants; the order of redistribution was to first redistribute school land and land belonging to households without heirs, and then redistribute land where too much fruit had been obtained. The party member cadres had originally returned 46 mu of land, which was too much, so it was given back to them according to the production. Only 32.26 mu were used. Sixteen middle peasant households "voluntarily" returned 31 mu of land because they felt their yields were too high, but after detailed discussion, only 7 households were accepted for a total of 18.75 mu of land. After the evaluation and allocation were completed, a list was posted, and the masses were given two days to review it. As a result, only two people raised opinions (a total of 46 households were allocated), both wanting to exchange for nearby land, and their requests were partially met based on the circumstances. During the two days that the masses were reviewing the land allocation, the evaluation of houses was also carried out. Originally, the houses in Sanwang Village had not been allocated since the anti-traitor liquidation, and many people were temporarily borrowing them. Others had no houses to live in, and wanted to allocate these houses well. Therefore, at the beginning of the redistribution, more people wanted houses than land, but because the spring ploughing was approaching, it was decided to allocate land first and then houses. While evaluating the land, the Farmers' Association Committee invited several people familiar with the village's house conditions to conduct a survey, roughly classifying the houses into six levels and making a preliminary allocation plan, trying to take care of everyone's kinship, favoring those who were close, and not allocating those who didn't get along in the same courtyard, allocating brothers to live together, so the evaluation was relatively smooth. Good houses were generally allocated to poor and hired peasants. Those who had been wrongly struggled against were returned to their original houses if suitable, and if not, they were allocated better houses to live in, and everyone had no major objections. Among the 56 households that were allocated houses, only 8 raised opinions, which were all resolved later.

　　Party Members Work Actively, Masses Are Very Satisfied
　　At the same time, party rectification was also carried out in conjunction with the redistribution process. The methods were: first, some party members who had repented well were sent to participate in the redistribution work, allowing them to reintegrate with the masses in practical action and be tested by the masses. The party members themselves were eager to show themselves in their work, demonstrating their new style and mass viewpoint, and the redistribution work was done extremely carefully. For example, the classification and allocation of houses were all done with the participation of party members Li Wenxiang, Li Binglan, and others. Second, the losses of many people who had been wrongly struggled against by party members due to personal grudges were compensated in the redistribution, further improving their relationship with the party members. At the beginning of the redistribution, the masses' thinking was focused on demanding the punishment of party members. After the redistribution, their losses were compensated, and their ill will gradually dissipated. Now, the work in Sanwang Village has shifted to rectifying mutual aid and carrying out production.

### 发扬民主贯彻领导三王村按产量抽补

　　发扬民主贯彻领导三王村按产量抽补
    【本报消息】武安九区三王村还在整党高潮时候，工作组即着手作抽补准备。由农会委员会派出三人，另邀请熟悉本村土地情况的二人，组织抽补小组进行土地调查。全村一百九十五户，现有人口七百十六人，在外者二十三人，共有土地二千一百八十二亩，产量四千四百十五小石，连在外户算上每人平均土地二亩九分，产量五石九斗。其中贫农占有产量每人平均五石四斗，新中农五石八斗，老中农七石二斗。若依平均产量五石九斗填平，势必抽动全部老中农的超过部分。若把平均产量压低至五石七斗，则只需抽动土地一百八十余亩；而全村可能抽动土地有学校地四亩二分，绝户地六亩一分，流亡在外十余年已确定不归来的土地五十一亩二分，干部多占土地可退出三十二亩，自反奸清算以来多得土地的可退出十九亩，相差只六十亩上下。因此确定在较小范围内实行抽补，并于划完第二次阶级之后（三月二十一日）立即开始进行。
    开始先在农会小组评议各人自报的窟窿，然后再拿到街的大会上去评。一面抽补小组则继续澄家当。街的会议上争论很多，对房子比对土地争论得更剧烈。张正本要房子，别人说：“你喂着两头牛，一个驴，三十只羊，又有劳力，给你点木石把房修盖起来算了。”于是有人要房子，就都要他自己盖，也不看是贫农中农，盖得起盖不起。中农有好地有坏地，李丙芳要换好地，别人说：“你有二亩园，还有南岗一亩二、十八亩（地名）一亩三好地，还要换，坏地叫谁种？”贫农净是坏地的也不让换，说“他不能换你就能换？”讨价还价、绝对平均的思想很浓厚。
    进行抽补教育　克服绝对平均
    于是第二天专门进行一次抽补教育，为使意见容易集中，只开农会委员和小组长联席会，开头谈到给谁填的问题，有人说：“谁窟窿大给谁填。”有人说：“被斗户的窟窿最大，应该先给他填。”贫农媳妇鲍弟的说：“不管给谁填，要看他是啥阶级，看了阶级再看他的窟窿。”这时候把满足贫雇要求和团结中农两条土地改革的基本原则给念了念，解释了一下，再引导讨论，意见慢慢集中。最后把鲍弟的“先看阶级后看窟窿”的主张作为决定，把首先必须满足贫雇农的要求这个观念明确了，接着谈到往哪里抽的问题。抽补小组把澄出来的家当给大家作报告，让大家都摸摸家底，又把团结中农的五项原则及第一类地区抽补原则念了念，让他们展开讨论。因为大家都摸了家底，知道即使不抽动中农，填补也能做好，所以对中农的意见都很温和，都承认只有中农自愿拿出来的才能要，但对翻身过高的人，却有三、二个人有点偏激情绪，如说“翻身过高的分给他点峻地刨刨，”（意思是要把他的地全退出来，再给他点峻地）“他如有劳力，分给他峻地也可以”，但立即就被人顶回去。这时便指出让他们刨峻地是不顾大体的说法，并针对着类似的思想，强调抽补是农民自己整顿家务，要公平合理，要当家，要顾大体，要自己负责去澄家当。后来在贫雇小组会上又作了一次同样的教育，启发他们要在家务问题上起骨干作用。
    第三次划阶级后，分别召开中农和贫农的会议，对中农着重说明必须照顾贫雇（这村中农占优势），并动员他们退出多占贱买的土地。多占果实的都当场表明态度：“过去重打重双打双，不该买的咱也买，现在一定要退。”多数新中农也说：“咱们要回头看，以前过的是什么时光，多得的土地一定退。”结果共退出十九亩一分半（干部党员除外，因为他们在开始整党时便已退出了）。对贫农则再一次着重说明满足贫雇翻身和巩固地团结中农原则。
    经过反复讨论之后，已到了具体分配时候，但若再让小组去无限制的讨论，便会拉长分配的过程，所以便改由农会委员会来掌握这件事，由小组派去九个代表及全部需要填补的人（名单是由小组和街的会议评定的）共同评议和分配。整整评了两天，在评议中间，一般都无争论，只有几个人不顾大局，有了好地还要好地，并且一定要退出坏地才要，不让退就连给他好地也不要。但这些意见，都遭到群众反对。至于分配的次序，是先分贫农，后分中农；抽动次序是先抽动学校地、绝户地，再抽动多得果实地。党员干部原来退出四十六亩地，退得太多，又给照产量补回去。只动用三十二亩二分六，有十六户中农自觉产量太高，“自动”土地三十一亩，但经过详细商谈之后，只接受了七户共十八亩七分半地。评议分配完后出榜，又让群众审查两天，结果只有两个人提出意见（共分配了四十六户），都是想换点近地，也根据情形，部分满足了他们的要求，群众审查土地分配的那两天，又进行房子的评议。原来三王村的房子，自反奸清算以来就没有分配过，许多人都是暂时借住的；另外的人没有房子住，也想把这些房子分配好。所以开始抽补时，要求房子的人比要求土地的多，但因春耕迫近，便决定先分土地后分房。又于评议土地同时，由农会委员会邀请几位熟悉本村房子情况的人，作了一番调查，大体把房子的好坏分了六级，并作出一个初步分配的方案，尽量照顾各人的亲疏厚薄，合不来的不把他分在一个院，弟兄们愿在一块的分在一块住，所以评议的时候便比较顺利。好房子一般都分给了贫雇农，错斗户回原房合适的便回去，不合适的也给他分了较好的房子住，大家意见都不大。在分得房子的五十六户中，只八户提出意见，以后都解决了。
    党员积极工作　群众都很满意
    同时在抽补过程中，整党也结合着进行，其方法：一是把反省好的一些党员派去参加抽补工作，让他们在实际行动中和群众重新结合，受群众的考验，党员自身也急于在工作中表现自己，表现自己新的作风和群众观点，抽补工作都做得极其慎重。比如房子的分类配搭就都是党员李文相、李丙兰等参与做的。二是在抽补中满足了许多被党员挟嫌错斗的人的损失，进一步改善了他们和党员的关系。在抽补之初，群众的思想是胶着在要求处分党员上面的，抽补之后，他们的损失都得到补偿，恶感便逐渐消解了。现在三王村的工作已转入整顿互助，进行生产中。
