　　Xingtai Tenth District Inspects Spring Plowing
  　Most Village Cadres Still Not Actively Engaged in Production, Many Problems Exist
    [Xingtai News] After the Tenth District of this county mobilized for spring plowing production through a mass meeting of the entire district in mid-March and a meeting of cadres and party members, some ideological problems of cadres and the masses were resolved, and spring plowing production made some progress. For example, Fan Jincai, the village head of Tanyu Village, organized sixteen households to cultivate three and a half mu of land in the dry riverbed, and Ma Wenjing, the branch secretary, led the masses to plant more than 700 willow trees (for everyone to raise sheep), 170 fruit trees, reclaim 24 mu of wasteland, and cultivate 240 mu of ripe wasteland. After the rain, he also led the masses to plant all the dry sloping land. Bai Huini, chairman of the Chongshuiyu Women's Federation, led women to actively spin and weave to ensure that they would not have to buy cloth throughout the year. In January, nine villages including Yanggou, Fangjiapu, and Beipozi opened 568 mu of wasteland and planted 4,000 to 5,000 trees. However, according to the district's recent inspection, many problems remain unresolved: First, some party members and cadres have not yet resolved their ideological problems. Some of them dare not do it and dare not not do it, and always act as the tail of the masses, unable to play a leading role. In villages such as Lujiazhuang and Huili, when assigning burden quotas, if one person disagrees, they have to re-evaluate, and it takes three or four nights to make a decision. The branch secretary of Songjiazhuang did not dare to go to the meeting even when the district notified him to go, pushing the poor and hired peasants to go instead. Some village branches are afraid of being called "small cliques," and dare not even hold meetings, let alone lead. Other party members are still lying down and doing nothing. Zhang Wenbin, the branch secretary of Chongshuiyu, who also serves as the manager of the cooperative, is found by women several times a day because they want to spin and weave, but he does not go. In general, they can be divided into three categories: one is that cadres actively lead production, which is a minority, only seven villages; one is that they dare not do it and dare not not do it, and production leadership is still not energetic, which is the majority, with 22 villages; one is that they lie down and do nothing, still in four villages. Second, on the part of the masses, after last month's mobilization, the general mood has changed greatly, but some still have panic and anxiety. The poor peasant Guo Shiming is not at ease with production because he turned over three-tenths more land than the average, saying that he cannot farm it himself. Huo Zhensheng in Yegoumen wants to dig up a dry jujube tree in his field but dare not; the middle peasant Huo Zhenbin wants to sell his disabled donkey to buy a good one but dare not, and is very distressed; some old middle peasants are frightened by the word "old." A poor peasant in Dushu Village said: "The Land Law is a hot pot of cake, you can't eat it without opening the lid, and you still have to dig sloping land." Some people are waiting for equal distribution, and some are afraid of equal distribution. Third, mutual assistance is not equivalent. Although the mutual assistance wages in Shitan Village are the same, the poor peasants can repay the middle peasants until the wheat harvest, while the middle peasants must repay the poor peasants every five to ten days, and the middle peasants are dissatisfied. Fourth, some cooperatives have actually stopped operating, and dare not ask the masses for outstanding debts, and capital cannot be turned over. Some are building large cabinet rooms, wanting to "catch the big," and using a lot of labor and money, unable to help the masses in production, and the masses are dissatisfied. Chongshuiyu used more than 1,000 workers to build houses, which could open 200 mu of wasteland, and Huili also used more than 500 workers. Eleven cooperative personnel in Shantou Village have abandoned production, and all the land in their homes has to be cultivated by the masses. After reviewing the above problems, it was decided to continue to specifically explain the Land Law and the policies towards all classes and the party rectification policy, and to study new work and leadership methods, to generally establish production committees, to democratically rectify cooperative mutual assistance, and to squeeze out surplus labor to engage in sideline occupations, etc. (Xingtai Tenth District Working Group)
    Editor's Note: It is good that the Tenth District of Xingtai has conducted such an in-depth inspection, continued to discover problems, and is not satisfied with the existing achievements, but the planned future work plan is not specific. For example, should the labor-intensive and costly phenomenon of cooperative housing construction be stopped immediately? Do cooperatives need so many people who are divorced from production? How to overcome the dissatisfaction of the middle peasants in the mutual aid group? We hope for specific reports.

### 邢台十区检查春耕　多数村干仍不积极生产中问题还不少

　　邢台十区检查春耕
  　多数村干仍不积极生产中问题还不少
    【邢台消息】本县十区经过三月中旬全区群众大会及干部党员会议动员春耕生产，解决了部分干部与群众的思想问题，使春耕生产得到一些进展。比如，檀峪村长范金财，组织十六户群众在干河滩修地三亩半，支书马文镜领导群众栽柳树七百多棵（为了大家喂羊），果树一百七十棵，开荒廿四亩，刨熟荒二百四十亩。落雨后又领导群众将旱坡地全部下了种。崇水峪妇女主席白会妮领导妇女积极纺织，保证全年不买布。杨沟、放家铺、北坡子等九村一月开生荒五百六十八亩，栽树四、五千棵。但是，据该区最近检查，仍有许多问题未解决：一、党员干部中仍有一部分没解决思想问题。其中有的是不敢干又不敢不干，处处给群众当尾巴，不能起领导作用。路家庄、会里等村派负担款，有一个人不同意就得重评，三、四夜作不了决定。宋家庄支书，区里通知他去开会也不敢去，推着让贫雇去。有些村支部怕人说“小集团”，连会也不敢开，根本说不上领导。另一些党员是仍然躺着不干。崇水峪支书张文彬兼合作社经理，妇女因要纺织，一天找他好几回也不去。总起来说，约分三类：一类是干部积极领导生产，这是少数，只七个村；一类是不敢干又不敢不干，生产领导仍不带劲，这是多数，有廿二村；一类是躺倒不干，仍有四村。二、群众方面，经过上月动员，一般情绪有很大转变，但有一部分仍有恐慌不安情绪。贫农郭世明因为翻身比平均地数多三分，即不安心生产，说是自己种不了。野沟门霍振生地里有棵干枣树，想刨不敢刨；中农霍振彬想卖了残废的驴买个好驴也不敢，非常苦闷；老中农有的被一个“老”字吓得恐慌不安。杜树村一个贫农说：“土地法是热腾腾一锅糕，不揭盖不能吃，还得刨坡地哩。”有些人在等待平分，有的害怕平分。三、互助不等价。石檀村互助工资虽一样，但贫农欠中农可以到麦收还，中农欠贫农则须五天至十天一交，中农不满。四、合作社有的实际停止了活动，外欠不敢向群众要，资本无法周转。有的大修柜房，想“抓大”用工用钱很多，不能帮助群众生产，群众不满。崇水峪盖房子用工一千多个，能开二百亩荒，会里也用工五百多。山头村十一个合作社人员脱离生产，家中地全要群众代耕。以上许多问题经检讨后，决定继续具体解释土地法与对各阶级政策整党政策，及研究新的工作与领导方法，普遍建立生产委员会，民主整顿合作互助，挤出剩余劳力搞副业等。（邢台十区工作组）
    编者按：邢台十区这样深入检查，继续发现问题，不满足于已有成绩是好的，但规定的以后工作计划是不具体的。比如，合作社大修房屋的劳民伤财现象是否马上停止呢？合作社脱离生产人员是否需要那样多？互助组中中农的不满怎样克服呢？希具体报导。
