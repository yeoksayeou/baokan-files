How Did Guzhen Carry Out the Party Rectification Democratic Movement?

　　Guzhen is a mid-sized town in the ninth district of Wu'an, with 495 households, a population of over 1,700, and 5,400 mu of land. It has small-scale industry and commerce. After years of mass movements and land reform following the "May 4th" directive, the land in the village has been largely leveled. According to the initial class classification, excluding those who were struggled against and those who received adjustments, there are 133 poor peasant households, totaling 344 people, with an average of 3 mu of land per person and a yield of 5.2 shi. There are 154 new middle peasant households, totaling 527 people, with an average of 3.8 mu of land per person and a yield of 6.5 shi. There are 60 old middle peasant households, totaling 221 people, with an average of 3.1 mu of land per person and a yield of 5.3 shi. The land and yield of these three classes have reached or exceeded the village average.

　　There are a total of 123 households who were struggled against and those who received adjustments. According to the new standards for class classification, there are only 5 landlord households and 5 rich peasant households. Of the remaining 113 households, there are 19 upper-middle peasant households, 52 middle peasant households, 22 new middle peasant households, 13 poor peasant households, and 7 other households. One-third of these people were "swept out of the house." Although they were later allocated some land, the amount was small. Cadres and Party members generally became too well-off after the land reform, with yields above 8 shi (the village average is 5 shi), and some even reaching 15 shi.

　　The Guzhen branch has 26 Party members, including 2 middle peasants, 16 new middle peasants, and 8 poor peasants. The village branch leadership has had some achievements in opposing the puppet regime and in the production and famine relief efforts of the 32nd and 33rd years of the Republic of China. However, some Party members began to become corrupt after the land reform. Last spring, the "squeezing out of feudalism" seriously harmed the middle peasants, and there were many cases of beating and hanging people. During the "face-washing and blackening" process, the masses raised many opinions to the cadres, but before the masses could finish expressing their opinions, the leadership commended the cadres, and the cadres retaliated, causing many masses to suffer. In addition, over the years of "anti-special agent" campaigns, many honest farmers were wrongly labeled as "special agents." Without resolving these two knots, democracy and filling gaps would be impossible in Guzhen village.

　　The work team arrived in Guzhen on March 20th. Having learned in advance that the situation in this village was relatively complex, it was decided to first conduct mass-based investigation and research in action, widely collect various materials, and prepare for the formal start of work. That day, a branch meeting was convened to explain the intentions, exert serious pressure on the erroneous thoughts and behaviors of Party members, and positively state the determination to rectify the Party. At the same time, the situation of Party rectification in nearby villages was introduced, pointing out that "knowing and correcting mistakes is the only way out." Most Party members responded "very happily." They immediately made preliminary self-criticisms, and divided themselves into grades and types according to the nature and extent of their mistakes. After preliminary self-criticism, it was found that about one-third of the Party members had no mistakes, a little over one-third had medium mistakes, and no more than five or six people had the worst mistakes. Those with minor problems were very active, and automatically introduced which poor peasants and farmhands could be relied upon as a reference for the work team.

　　Educating Party Members to Know and Correct Mistakes, Inviting Poor Peasants and Farmhands to Discuss the Situation

　　In the evening, a symposium was held with poor peasants and farmhands, with the participation of more than 30 people. This was arranged by the comrades of the work team who had arrived in Guzhen in advance after two days of liaison. Zhao Jisheng was the first to speak, saying, "This time, we rely entirely on our poor peasants and farmhands to carry out the work. This time, no matter who it is, they will be rectified. We must first purify our hearts and unite. If we don't purify ourselves, we can't do anything, and I don't dare to lead." The comrades of the work team, hearing his words, judged that he might be a "careerist" and pointed out on the spot: "This time, the work is to implement democracy, with everyone in charge. Now, no one should say who leads whom. In the future, who will be the cadre will depend on everyone's election." As a result, Zhao Jisheng became honest, and everyone became active. They raised many opinions about the undemocratic things in the village and the good and bad of the cadres. Finally, they commented on each Party member one by one. The results of the comments were basically completely consistent with the preliminary self-criticisms of the Party members at the branch meeting during the day.

　　After these two meetings, the work team studied them in conjunction with other materials and realized that the Party member cadres and the masses were fully prepared.

　　The next day, the Party was made public, repeatedly stating the determination to "place the Guzhen Party under the supervision of the Guzhen masses." It was pointed out that the masses were afraid of retaliation and dared not speak, which was not the fault of the masses, but only the fault of the past work. Because the facts of cadres retaliating against the masses had been investigated in advance, they were pointed out one by one at the meeting, and the masses nodded in agreement. For the Party members who were most feared by the masses and had the most problems, their names were pointed out on the spot, and they were told to reflect on themselves, specifically supporting the masses.

　　Master the Initial Class Classification to Overcome the Biases in Life

　　The following two days of class classification were very careful. The masses and the households who were struggled against and those who received adjustments classified together. Detailed forms were developed to meticulously register the ownership of means of production and the mode of production. For those who had turned over, the investigation covered when they turned over and how they turned over. For those who had been struggled against, the investigation covered when they were struggled against, their production status after being struggled against, and changes in their living conditions. In order to ensure accuracy, in addition to investigating their production status in the year before the establishment of the democratic government, it was traced back to the previous four years (to see if it had been three full years since they had moved from laborers to exploiters). Class classification in each street was first preliminarily registered and discussed in groups, and then discussed and approved at a general street meeting, fully promoting the spirit of self-reporting and public discussion. Many people said, "You can say whatever you want at a meeting like this. This is the first time in Guzhen."

　　Class classification is an acute struggle. Some people often focus on comparing their current lives to raise the class status of others. The work team resolutely grasped the central government's standards for class classification, overcame the tailism of following the opinions of the masses, and criticized the thinking of "comparing lives." Liu Yongnian had one person, currently with 3.6 mu of land and a yield of more than 5 shi. According to the average land in Guzhen, this was completely enough for a new middle peasant. He worked as a long-term laborer for most of his life. Later, he planted 3 mu of public land, which was not enough to eat. Last year, he exchanged some better land and half a mu of garden, and only then did he reach a yield of 5 shi. His middle peasant life began after the autumn harvest last year and has been less than a year, so he was still classified as a poor peasant. Li Dongfang had five people, fifteen mu of land. During the winter slack season, he opened a small restaurant as a supplement to agricultural income. Therefore, his life was not bad and he was classified as a middle peasant. Liu Shuanzhu had four people, twelve mu of land. In the summer, he earned rice as a long-term laborer in a mutual aid group. In the winter, he worked odd jobs in a sugar mill to make ends meet. This was considered a hard sideline occupation, and therefore he was classified as a poor peasant. Taking the relations of production as the sole standard for class classification – repeatedly publicizing this policy, enhanced the enthusiasm of the entire poor peasant stratum, and everyone naturally unfolded criticism and self-criticism during class classification. Huang Shuanzi was a poor peasant in terms of land and population. People said, "This person is really a poor peasant." Then they said, "He is a poor peasant, but he doesn't want to be controlled and likes to eat better. Only if you correct these two problems can you be considered a good poor peasant."

　　The result of the initial class classification was 60 middle peasant households, 154 new middle peasant households, and 133 poor peasant households. Poor peasants accounted for a little over one-quarter of the total number of households, and together with the new middle peasants, they accounted for the majority of the village's population.

　　The Masses Offer Each Other Opinions to Remold Themselves to Better Run the Home

　　The work team used its greatest strength to reorganize the ranks of the masses, preparing the actual organizational groundwork for the Party rectification democratic movement. After the initial class classification, "clearing the bottom" was conducted using criticism and self-criticism. A total of five times were conducted. Four conditions were stated during the process (long-term labor, being upright, being selfless, and being enthusiastic in serving the masses). Knowing that they were going to run the home, the poor peasants automatically used the four conditions to measure and remold themselves. The new middle peasants were very active, and the concerns of the old middle peasants (fear of adjustments) were gradually broken in the "clearing the bottom."

　　In the process of brewing the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League and the New Farmers' Association, four more "clearing the bottom" exercises were conducted after this one. Once when selecting the initiators of the Farmers' Association and the Poor Peasants' League, once when establishing the poor peasant groups, once when self-reporting and publicly discussing joining the Farmers' Association, and once when selecting candidates for the Farmers' Association and the Poor Peasants' League. As a result of the "clearing the bottom," the initial understanding of the active elements among the poor peasants and new middle peasants changed by about one-third. Zhao Jisheng, who had been arranged by the cadres and had been mean to people, and Qiao Hehui (a poor peasant) who had been active in trying to seize leadership, were both "cleared" out. This meticulous organizational work gradually made the masses aware of the power of their organization and established a broad mass base—especially a base among the poor peasants—for the work team.

　　The Party Conducts Class Investigation While the Masses Conduct Class Classification. It was found that generally, the people had become too well-off after their "turnover". Everyone said they wanted to "redeem their sins" and readily returned the fruits of their excess, returning 100 mu of land and more than 80 rooms at once. But after proposing to return the fruits, the situation could not be opened up. They were full of self-congratulatory feelings, always saying that the branch's class background was good and that they had done a lot of good things in the past. Liu Youkui said, "Don't rush, the credit is in the back!" They felt that they did not have too many mistakes, and they were unwilling to talk about the existing mistakes. Several key Party members had collectively embezzled in the past and were now protecting each other. The work team initially asked everyone to recall history in an attempt to raise their class consciousness. Several key Party members recalled that they were all poor peasants and farmhands in the past, their struggle was resolute, they did not shield landlords, and their leadership in overcoming famine was very successful... The more they thought about it, the better they felt, and they carried a new burden.

　　Closed-Door Reflection is Not Thorough, the Masses' Evidence Cannot Be Concealed

　　The work team believed that without applying the pressure of the masses, Party rectification would not be able to open up the situation, so it was decided to convene a mass meeting on the 24th to formally enter democratic Party rectification.

　　The first day of the meeting was held in a square courtyard, and the roofs were filled with people. Zhao Jitai first made a self-criticism. He first said that he was born into a poor family and had suffered, but after becoming a cadre, he forgot his roots. He also mentioned some specific mistakes, but the impression given was that he was avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial. Other Party members first offered opinions to him. Everyone only talked about what he himself had said, and it was only a supplement, and the phenomenon of mutual protection had not been broken. When the masses spoke, Aunt Laoquan fired the first shot, crying and asking Zhao Jitai why he retaliated against her after the "face-washing and blackening". This topic was well-chosen. Cadre retaliation was a major issue in Guzhen, and everyone was watching how this issue would be resolved in order to determine their own attitude toward participating in the democratic movement in the future. At this time, the atmosphere at the meeting was particularly tense. A woman named Liu Xiangzi came out to testify, proving that Zhao Jitai did indeed order the beating of Aunt Laoquan in retaliation. Zhao Jitai stood up to defend himself, saying that he did not know about the beating of Aunt Laoquan beforehand, proving that he himself was not retaliating. But four or five women rushed to testify, explaining the time, place, and circumstances one by one, proving that Zhao Jitai was entirely responsible for the beating of Aunt Laoquan. Zhao stopped talking. The work team and representatives of the masses made an on-the-spot decision, affirming that this incident was Zhao's retaliation. With the "retaliation issue" resolved, the masses' emotions immediately became active, and the men also successively began to offer opinions.

　　At this time, a blind anti-cadre sentiment arose among the masses. When the mistake of a Party member cadre was mentioned, someone would say, "Ask those Wang Chao and Ma Han." What he meant was to regard the Party member cadres as a group. The big cadres were "Bao Wenzheng," and the small cadres were "Wang Chao and Ma Han." The cadres oppressed the masses together, and the masses generally opposed the cadres. When the work team discovered this sentiment, it immediately suggested that everyone think about: "Who are Wang Chao and Ma Han?" It pointed out: Some Party members were Wang Chao and Ma Han, but some were good Party members. People like Zhao Jisheng, a non-Party "activist," were precisely "Wang Chao and Ma Han." A clamorous sound of "deliberation" rose in the ranks of the masses. Many people nodded and smiled, and some even shouted, "Yes, we can't say they are all Wang Chao and Ma Han." By treating different targets differently, raising questions from both positive and negative sides, and using specific people and events to say what was in the hearts of the masses, the masses' retaliatory emotions gradually subsided, and the relationship between the Party and the masses was initially reversed.

　　The Party Unfolds Ideological Struggle, the Masses Look at Good and Bad Separately

　　After the mass meeting, a branch meeting was convened. Zhao Jitai and Liu Youkui, who had been criticized, appeared depressed, and other Party members also lowered their heads. Some people said, "A thousand mistakes, ten thousand mistakes, are all our mistakes." Some people said, "If we had known we were going to rectify the Party, why did we make those mistakes?" The comrades of the work team gave timely principled education, explaining that those past mistakes "were about the smell of the affair, not the smell of the person." "Good Party members are not afraid of making mistakes, but afraid of not being able to correct them. If they correct their mistakes, they are good people." "The masses' opinions are like giving you medicine." The power of the mass meeting exceeded the expectations of some major cadres. Liu Youkui said, "The masses have suppressed you. You can't help but say it." Zhao Jitai, who had insisted that there was no corruption, said, "If you don't say it yourself, won't the masses know?" Seven key Party member cadres then automatically stated the facts of collective embezzlement. Liu Youkui stamped his feet and said one thing, Zhao Jitai stamped his feet and said another. The Party members who had not embezzled said, "Is that all you did?" "I am also a Party member, and I didn't know. If you don't admit it, it will implicate everyone." "Whoever is responsible is responsible!" Everyone followed the clues provided by the masses and pursued many facts that had not been exposed in the past. Those with many mistakes were determined: "It's no good not to say it." Those with fewer mistakes felt "relieved" and suggested that the meeting "be held until dawn." At this branch meeting, those who had made good self-criticisms were encouraged, and it was pointed out that everyone should perform well among the masses, and that past mistakes must be reflected on and corrected, but in order to clarify the facts, some unrealistic opinions could be explained and defended. Principles should be adhered to and struggles should be waged against one's own and others' mistakes.

　　Encouraging Party members to correct their mistakes from a positive perspective allowed everyone to see the way out in practical action. At the second mass meeting on the 25th, Zhao Jitai's self-criticism showed significant progress. He said many things that the masses did not know. The masses continued to offer opinions, and the response was very good. People quietly said, "He is illiterate, but he dug out things from years ago. It's not easy." Liu Youkui's self-criticism was not as good as Zhao Jitai's, but the masses said, "He's not in charge, so there won't be too many things." Seeing this sentiment from the masses, the work team immediately guided the masses to offer opinions to the other three Party member cadres. The mistakes of these three people were neither big nor small. The resolution of the problems still followed several steps: distinguishing facts, clarifying responsibilities, finding witnesses and evidence, and making an on-the-spot decision. Seeing that the problems could be solved on the spot, the masses' emotions were high. Zhao Jitai and Liu Youkui also joined the masses in exposing many of their mistakes. On this day, in addition to offering opinions to these three people, the masses began to involve other Party members and non-Party cadres. In order to maintain this full enthusiasm of the masses and avoid getting entangled with a few people, on the 26th, everyone offered opinions to all cadres and activists. Those that could be resolved on the spot were resolved on the spot, and those that could not be resolved on the spot were recorded and continued to be investigated and dealt with. After this meeting, some of the masses said, "This is like seeing the blue sky," "I'm going home to eat two more bowls of rice."

　　In these three days of mass meetings, the masses initially saw their own strength. "This time, we are really going to be the masters of our own house." The work team mobilized everyone to review why they had not been the masters of their own house in the past. People said, "In the past, we didn't form an egg. We took care of ourselves and couldn't do anything." The work team seized on this organizational demand of the masses based on democratic ownership. In the afternoon of the 26th, it held a founding meeting of the Poor Peasants' League and the New Farmers' Association and elected a chairman and committee members. The simultaneous establishment of two organizations could consolidate the unity of the middle peasants in addition to mobilizing the poor peasants. With a certain number of Poor Peasants' League committee members serving as ex-officio members of the New Farmers' Association, the leadership of the poor peasants could also be guaranteed. When electing, the Poor Peasants' League committee members were elected first, followed by the New Farmers' Association committee members. The election used the method of anonymous voting. As a result, poor peasants and new middle peasants accounted for more than two-thirds of the members of the Farmers' Association, and Communist Party member Huang Zhishen was elected as the chairman of the New Farmers' Association.

### 固镇怎样进行整党民主运动的？

　　固镇怎样进行整党民主运动的？
    固镇是武安九区一个中等镇子，有四百九十五户，一千七百多口人，土地五千四百亩。有小规模的工商业。经过历年的群众运动和“五四”指示后的土地改革，全村土地已大体填平。据初划阶级结果，除了斗争户、调剂户外，贫农共一百三十三户，三百四十四人，每人平均土地三亩，产量五石二斗。新中农一百五十四户，五百二十七人，每人平均土地三亩八分，产量六石五斗。老中农六十户，二百二十一人，每人平均土地三亩一分，产量五石三斗。这三个阶层的土地、产量，都已达到或超过了全村平均数量。
    全村斗争户和调剂户共一百二十三户，按照新标准划阶级，只有五户地主，五户富农。其余一百一十三户中，有上中农十九户，中农五十二户，新中农二十二户，贫农十三户，其他七户。这些人有三分之一被“扫地出门”，以后虽然分配了一些土地，但为数较少。干部、党员一般翻身过高，产量都在八石以上（本村平均产量五石），有的竟高到十五石。
    固镇支部现有党员二十六人，内中农二人，新中农十六人，贫农八人。村支部领导反维持和民国三十二、三年的生产渡荒，都有若干成绩。但某些党员在土地改革后开始腐蚀了。去年春天挤封建，严重的伤害了中农，打人吊人的事情不少。洗脸擦黑时，群众向干部提了不少意见，但群众意见没提完，领导上又给干部表功，干部回头报复，好多群众受了打击。此外历年“反特”有不少老实农民错戴了“特务”帽子。不解开这两个疙＠，固镇村谈不到民主和填补。
    工作组在三月二十日到了固镇。事先了解到这个村子的情况比较复杂，因此确定首先在行动中进行群众性的调查研究，广泛收集各种材料，给正式入手工作作准备。当天就召开了支部会，说明来意，对于党员的错误思想和行为施以严重的压力，正面表明整党的决心。同时介绍了附近各村整党的情况，指出了“知错改错，才是出路”。一般党员都反映“很痛快”。当场就自动作了初步检讨，按照所犯错误的性质与程度，划分了等级及类型。经过初步检讨，发现没有什么错误的党员约占三分之一，中等错误的占三分之一强，顶坏的不过五、六个人。毛病小的表现非常积极，自动介绍了村里哪些贫雇可以依靠，作为工作组参考。
    教育党员知错改错邀集贫雇座谈情况
    晚上召开了一个贫雇座谈会，参加的有三十多个人。这是工作组事先到固镇的同志，经过两天串连起来的。赵吉盛第一个发言，他说：“这回搞工作，全靠咱们贫雇。这回不管谁，都要整。咱们要先把心洗正，团结起来。不洗好自己，什么事情也干不成，我也不敢领导。”工作组的同志听了他的话，判断他可能是个“野心家”，当场指出：“这回搞工作是实行民主，众人当家，现在谁也不要说领导谁。将来谁当干部，要靠大家选举。”这么一来，赵吉盛老实了，大家活跃了。对村里不民主的事情和干部的好坏提了许多意见。最后挨个把党员都评论了一番，评论的结果，和白天开支部会党员初步检讨的情形，基本上完全一致。
    开过这两个会，工作组结合其他材料加以研究，认识到党员干部和群众都已经有了充分的准备。
    第二天公开党，一再说明“把固镇党置于固镇群众监督之下”的决心。指出群众怕报复不敢讲话，这不怨群众，只怨过去的工作有毛病。由于事先调查了干部报复群众的事实，会上一一指出，群众点头称是。对于群众最害怕、毛病最多的党员，当场指出名字，要他们好好反省，具体的给群众撑了腰。
    初划阶级掌握好克服比生活偏向
    接着两天划阶级是很慎重的。群众和被斗户、调剂户一起划。制订了详细表格，详细登记生产资料的占有状况和生产方式，对翻身户调查何时翻身、怎样翻身，对被斗户调查何时被斗、被斗后的生产状况，和生活状况的变化。为了确实无讹，除了调查他们民主政府成立前一年的生产状况外，并追溯到前四年（看由劳动者转入剥削者是否已满三年）。各街划阶级都是先在小组初步登记评议，再到全街大会讨论通过，充分发扬了自报公议的精神，许多人说：“象这样子的会，你想说啥就说啥，在咱固镇是第一回。”
    划阶级是个尖锐的斗争，有些人往往着重比眼下的生活来提高旁人的成份，工作组坚决掌握中央划阶级的标准，克服跟着群众意见跑的尾巴主义，批评了“比生活”的思想。刘永年一口人，现有三亩六分地，五石多产量。按固镇土地平均数，完全够个新中农。他住了多半辈长工，以后种了三亩公地，不够吃，去年换了一些较好的地和半亩园子，才达到了五石产量。他的中农生活是从去年秋收以后开始，至今不及一年，因此仍订为贫农。李东方五口人，十五亩地，冬闲了开小饭馆，作为农业收入的补充。生活因而过的不赖，定为中农。刘拴柱四口人，十二亩地，夏天在互助组长工挣米，冬天在糖坊打杂，才能够着生活，这算作艰苦副业，因而定为贫农。以生产关系为划阶级的唯一标准——反复宣传了这个政策，提高了整个贫农层的积极性，大家在划阶级时很自然的展开了批评与自我批评。黄拴子按照土地、人口看来都是贫农，人们说：“这个人真是穷农”。接着又说：“穷农可是穷农，就是不想受，还好吃点，改过这两个毛病，你才算个好穷农。”
    初划阶级的结果，划出中农六十户，新中农一百五十四户，贫农一百三十三户，贫农占全村户数四分之一强，加上新中农，占全村人口的大多数。
    群众互相提意见改造自己好当家
    工作组用了最大的力量整编了群众的队伍，给整党民主运动作了实际的组织的准备。初划阶级后，用批评和自我批评的方法进行“澄底”。一共进行了五次。进行时讲了四个条件（长年劳动、为人正派、大公无私、热心给群众办事）。贫农知道自己要当家，自动以四个条件来衡量与改造自己。新中农表现很活跃，老中农的顾虑（怕调剂）则逐渐在“澄底”中打破了。
    在酝酿成立贫农团、新农会的过程中，在这一次“澄底”以后，又连续进行了四次。选农会、贫农团发起人时一次，成立贫农组时一次，自报公议入农会时一次，选农会、贫农团候选人时一次。“澄底”的结果，最初了解的贫农、新中农的积极分子，约计变动了三分之一。干部布置进来的赵吉盛曾经刻薄过人，多方活动想着攫取领导权的乔和会（贫农）都“澄”出来了。这种细密的组织工作，逐步使群众认识了自己组织起来的力量，建立了工作组广泛的群众——特别是贫农的依托和基础。
    党内在群众划阶级时进行了查阶级。发现一般都是翻身过高。大家都说要“赎罪”，自动退果实很痛快，一下子退出一百亩地，八十多间房。但在提出退果实后，局面就打不开了。他们充满了表功情绪，一说就是支部成份好，过去作过不少好事。刘有魁说：“别忙，功在后面呢？”他们一方面感觉自己没有太大的错误，对于现有的错误又不愿讲。几个主要党员曾经集体贪污，现在互相包庇。工作组起初让大家回忆历史，企图提高他们的阶级觉悟。几个主要党员回想起过去都是贫雇，斗争坚决，没有包庇地主，领导渡荒又很有成绩………，越想自己越不错，又背上了新包袱。
    关门反省不深入群众对证瞒不得
    工作组认为不施以群众的压力，整党眼见得不能打开局面，因此决定从二十四日起，召开群众大会，正式进入民主整党。
    第一天大会在一个方方的院子里举行，屋顶上都坐满了人。赵吉太先反省。他先说自己是穷人出身，受过苦，以后当了干部，忘了本。具体的错误事实也提到一些，给人的印象都是避重就轻。其他党员先向他提意见，凡是他自己说过的，大家才跟着谈谈，只是一种补充的性质，相互包庇的现象还未打破。群众发言时，老泉婶打了第一炮，哭着质问赵吉太为什么洗脸擦黑后报复她。这个题目抓得很好，干部报复，在固镇是一件大事，大家都在观望怎么解决这个问题，以便确定今后自己参加民主运动的态度。这时会场情绪特别紧张。妇女刘香子出来作证，证明赵吉太确实是因为报复吊打了老泉婶。赵吉太起来申诉，说打老泉婶的事他事先并不知道，证明他自己不是报复。但四、五个妇女赶忙出来作证，把时间、地点、情节一一说清，证明打老泉婶完全是赵吉太的主使。赵不说话了，工作组和群众代表当场定了案，肯定这件事是赵的报复。解决了“报复问题”，群众情绪马上活跃起来，男人们也陆续提开意见了。
    这时群众中产生了一种盲目的反干部情绪，提到一个党员干部的错误时就有人讲：“问问那些王朝马汉吧。”他的意思是把党员干部都看成一伙，大干部是“包文正”，小干部是“王朝马汉”，干部一齐压迫群众，群众也一般的反对干部。工作组发现这种情绪，立时提议大家想想：“哪些人是王朝马汉？”指出：有些党员是王朝马汉，但有些则是好党员。象赵吉盛这种非党员的“积极分子”，正是“王朝马汉”。群众队伍中兴起一片嘈杂的“酝酿”声，好多人点头微笑，有的径直嚷着：“对呀，不能说都是王朝马汉呀”。区别对待了不同的对象，正反两面的提出问题，用具体的人、事说出群众心里的话，大家的报复情绪逐渐消下去了，党群关系初步的扭转了。
    党内展开思想斗争群众分别好坏看待
    开完大会以后召开支部会，被提了意见的赵吉太、刘有魁表现消沉，其他党员也低了头。有人说：“千错万错，都是咱们的错。”有人说：“早知道要整党，为什么要犯那些个错误。”工作组同志及时进行了原则教育，说明过去那些错误“是事臭，不是人臭。”“好党员不怕犯错，怕不能改错，改了错误就是好人。”“群众提意见，是给你吃药。”群众大会的力量超出某些大干部的预料，刘有魁说：“群众把你压住了，想不说也不照。”过去坚持没有贪污现象的赵吉太说：“你自己不说，群众还不知道？”七个主要党员干部这时自动说出了集体贪污的事实，刘有魁跺跺脚，说出一宗，赵吉太跺跺脚，说出另一宗。没有贪污的党员说：“你们就干了这些事？”“我也是个党员，我就不知道，你们不承认，可要连累大家。”“谁的责任谁负！”大家从群众提出的线索追出许多过去没有暴露过的事实，错误多的下了决心：“不说不行”。错误少的感觉“痛快”，提议把这个会“开到天明”。在这个支部会上，对于反省好的作了鼓励，指出：大家应该好好在群众中表现自己，过去的错误一定反省改正，但是为了搞清事实，对于某些不符实际的意见可以解释申辩。应该坚持原则，向自己及他人的错误作斗争。
    从积极方面鼓励党员改正错误，使大家在实际行动中看清了出路。廿五日再开大会，赵吉太的反省有了显著的进步，好多群众不知道的事情都说了。群众继续提了意见，反映很好，悄悄的说：“他不识字，几年的事情都挖出来，不容易。”刘有魁的反省不如赵吉太，但群众说：“他不当家，事情也不会太多。”看到群众这种情绪，工作组立即引导群众向其他三个党员干部提意见，这三个人的错误不大不小，解决问题仍然遵循辨事实、明责任、找出人证物证、当场定案等几个步骤。群众看见问题能够当场解决，情绪很高。赵吉太、刘有魁也和群众一起揭发了他们不少错误。这一天，群众除了向这三个人提意见外，已开始涉及其他党员和非党干部。为保持群众这种饱满情绪，避免纠缠在几个人身上，在二十六日，大家向所有干部、积极分子提意见，能解决的当场解决，不能当场解决的记一笔帐，继续调查处理。开完这个会，有的群众说：“这可是看见青天了”，“回家多吃两碗饭。”
    群众在这三天大会中，初步看见了自己的力量，“这回真要当家作主了。”工作组发动大家检讨了过去为什么没有当家？人们说：“过去没有抱成一个蛋，自管自，干不了啥事情。”工作组抓住群众这种基于民主当家而产生的组织起来的要求，在二十六日下午，举行贫农团和新农会成立大会，并选举主席和委员。同时成立两个组织，除了发动贫农外，更能够巩固的团结中农。以一定数量的贫农团委员作为新农会的当然委员，又可保证了贫农的领导。选举时先选贫农团委员，后选新农会委员。选举采用不记名票选方法，结果贫农和新中农在农会委员中占了三分之二强，共产党员黄治森当选为新农会主席。（工作组）
