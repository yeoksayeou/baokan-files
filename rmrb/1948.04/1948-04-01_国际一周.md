International Week
March 22nd to 28th

While the US imperialists personally command the entire army of the Greek puppet government in battle, the Greek Democratic Army won an unprecedented major victory near the capital of the Peloponnese peninsula the week before, wiping out 6,000 enemies in one fell swoop, knocking directly on the door of the Greek puppet government's lair in Athens, and cutting off all traffic between Athens and northern Greece. This brilliant victory of the Democratic Army, and the current victorious national offensive, not only demonstrates that "the Greek royalist government is suffering a very serious military crisis" (Red Star), but also proves that the "aid" of American guns and money is useless, and the direct armed intervention of the American imperialists cannot save the death of the Greek reactionaries.

This week, people from European countries such as France, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, and Denmark have risen up to resist the anti-communist and anti-democratic offensives launched by Wall Street and its lackeys, and have used protests, strikes, and demonstrations to oppose the "Marshall Plan" that enslaves the people of Western Europe. The French Communist Party called on the French people to take action to "defend international peace, abolish the Brussels military treaty," and demanded the dissolution of the reactionary armed forces of the de Gaulle League. British workers and people from all walks of life launched a nationwide protest movement against the exclusion of communists from government agencies. In response to Attlee's anti-communist statement, one hundred people immediately announced their joining the British Communist Party at a mass meeting in Manchester alone. At the same time, the Labour government's reactionary policy of freezing wages, which attacked the working class, was fiercely opposed by trade union representatives representing 2,032,000 votes.

In Italy, as the election approaches, the US imperialists, colluding with its servants Britain, France, and the Vatican, are using all kinds of despicable means to interfere. The cruising of US warships in the Mediterranean, the conclusion of the Franco-Italian customs union, and the fact that Dunn, as the US ambassador to Italy, is campaigning for Gasperi, are all intended to scare and obstruct the Italian people's support for the People's Democratic Front. On the other hand, the US imperialists are also staging a farce of handing the port of 的 [Delos] over to Italy, in violation of the Five-Power Treaty, in an attempt to provoke the Italo-Yugoslav dispute, divert the Italian people's attention, and thereby increase Gasperi's election capital. But all these extremely vicious conspiracies and tricks of "doing all kinds of bad things" have not only aroused the anger and powerful counterattack of the Italian people, but also adequately exposed the American imperialists and their lackeys' full fear and loss of confidence in the Italian election. At the same time, the movement against Truman's policies is rising in the United States. Ignoring the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law and police threats, the great strike of more than 400,000 coal miners has lasted for more than ten days, and the coal shortage has forced partial reduction and suspension of production and transportation. The great strike of meat workers also continues, and students and veterans have also begun to respond to Truman's anti-Soviet clamor and proposals to restore conscription with strikes, demonstrations, and protests.

In the Far East, a nationwide strike of Japanese workers demanding wage increases has begun. In order to resist the MacArthur headquarters' ban on general strikes, Japanese trade unions have adopted a clever method of staggered strikes. This is a powerful blow to the US imperialists who are supporting Japan as a base for aggression in the Far East. People from all over North Korea recently held mass rallies of hundreds of thousands of people to protest against the South Korean pseudo-election and resolutely oppose the dangerous and poisonous conspiracy of the American imperialists to divide and enslave Korea, fully reflecting the will of the North Korean people to fight for the unification, independence, and freedom of Korea.

　　国际一周
    三月二十二日至二十八日
    当美帝亲自统率希腊伪政府全军作战之时，希腊民主军却于周前在摩里亚半岛首府附近赢得空前大捷，一举歼敌六千人，直叩希伪政府老巢雅典大门，并切断了雅典与希腊北部的所有交通。民主军这次辉煌胜利，以及目前正在展开的全国胜利大进军，不仅说明“希腊保皇政府正遭受着极严重的军事危机”（红星报），而且足以证明：美国大炮、金元的“援助”既无济于事，美帝的直接武装干涉也同样抢救不了希腊反动派的死亡。
    本周，法、英、意、荷、比、瑞、丹等欧洲各国人民，奋起抗击华尔街及其奴才所发动的反共反民主攻势，并以抗议、罢工、示威来反对奴役西欧人民的“马歇尔计划”。法共号召法国人民行动起来“保卫国际和平，废除布鲁塞尔军事条约”，和要求解散戴高乐联盟的反动武装。英国工人与各界人士，展开了反对排除共产党出政府机关的全国性的抗议运动。为了回答艾德礼的反共声明，仅在曼彻斯特群众大会上，就有一百个人当场宣布加入英共。同时，工党政府向工人阶级进攻的冻结工资的反动政策，遭受了代表二百零三万二千票的职工会代表们的猛烈反对。
    在意大利，由于大选的日益迫近，美帝与其从仆英法及梵蒂冈勾结一起，正用尽一切卑鄙手段，进行干涉。美舰在地中海的游弋，法意关税同盟的缔结，邓纳以美驻意大使身份为加斯贝利奔走竞选，这一切无非想吓唬和阻挠意国人民对人民民主阵线的拥护。另一方面，美帝又导演一幕把的港交给意大利的破坏五国和约的把戏，企图借此挑拨意南纠纷，转移意大利人民的视线，从而增加加斯贝利的竞选资本。但这一切“坏事做尽”的穷凶极恶的阴谋狡计，不仅激起了意国人民的愤怒和有力反击，而且适足暴露了美帝及其走卒对意大选的满怀恐惧和丧失信心。与此同时，美国国内反对杜鲁门政策的运动正在兴起。不顾塔虎脱反劳工法和警察的威胁，四十余万煤矿工人的大罢工已坚持十余日，煤荒且已迫使生产与运输业局部减产与停运。肉类工人的大罢工也仍继续坚持中，而学生和退伍军人亦开始以罢课、示威和抗议，来回答杜鲁门的反苏叫嚣和恢复征兵的建议。
    在远东，日本职工要求增资的全国性大罢工已经开始。为了抵制麦克阿瑟总部的禁止总罢工法，日本各业工会采取了巧妙的此起彼伏的罢工方式。这是对于扶植日本作为侵略远东基地的美帝一个有力打击。北鲜各地人民日前举行数十万人的群众大会，抗议南鲜伪选，坚决反对美帝分裂与奴役朝鲜的险毒阴谋，充分反映了北鲜人民为朝鲜的统一、独立和自由而斗争的意志。（新华社）
