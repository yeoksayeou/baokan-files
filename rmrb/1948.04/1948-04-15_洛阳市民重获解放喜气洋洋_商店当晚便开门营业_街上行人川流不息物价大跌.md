Xinhua News Agency, Yushan'e Front, 13th: A frontline reporter reports on the grand occasion after the recovery of Luoyang City, saying: The citizens of Luoyang, who have regained their freedom, have been immersed in the joy of victory for days. As soon as our army entered the city, many shops opened for business, and all theaters opened that evening. The streets are like a festival every day, with pedestrians coming and going. The students are the most active. They gather in groups of three or five to find the People's Liberation Army (PLA) friends they met last time. The citizens also look for the municipal government staff they met last time to tell them about the various atrocities of the Jiang bandits in the past half month. The newly posted notices, leaflets, and picture albums are crowded with people all day long, and they are scrambling for the leaflets in the hands of the propagandists. The topics of discussion in the streets these days are the two battles to liberate Luoyang. They say: "Chairman Mao's tactics are brilliant. Last time, the 206th Division was wiped out, and the warehouse was opened to provide relief to the people. The United States and Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly mobilized troops and generals, and the PLA gave up an empty city, returned, and wiped out another regiment of them." Although the last time our army stayed in Luoyang was short, its good discipline and firm protection of industry and commerce left a deep impression on the citizens. They said: "The PLA is amiable, well-behaved, polite, knowledgeable, and truly does not commit the slightest offense against the people." An old gentleman named Geng on Zhongshan Street hid in the countryside when Luoyang was liberated last time, but this time he insisted on meeting and talking with the PLA. He invited a young comrade from the propaganda team to his home, inquired about the PLA's situation, and reported a hidden bad person. During the half-month that the Jiang bandits reoccupied, prices in Luoyang soared. A斗 (dou, a unit of dry measure equal to 14斤 or approximately 7kg) of wheat rose from 300,000 to 500,000 in Jiang currency, and pork rose from 24,000 to 48,000. On the first day after the recovery, the price of wheat plummeted to only 3,500 in Ji currency per 斗, equivalent to 210,000 in Jiang currency. When the citizens saw Mayor Yang Shaoqiao, they happily said: "Mayor Yang, you are back, and we have a way to make a living." Ji currency has high credibility, with an exchange rate of one to sixty with Jiang currency. The ticket price for the Junmin (Army-People) Theater on North Street is 15,000 Jiang currency, but only 200 Ji currency. The remnants of the Jiang bandits' fortifications in the city have been demolished, and the city defense troops clean them every day, giving the city a new look. Robberies often occurred during the Jiang bandits' rule. Now that a democratic order has begun to be established, the lives of citizens are stable, and many people go to the front of the Municipal Government to listen to the Shaanbei Xinhua Broadcasting Station every night. Merchants and students have requested to see the newspapers from the liberated areas. They ran to the preparatory office of the "New Luoyang Daily" to inquire about the publication date (note: the newspaper was launched on the 9th). The 120,000 citizens of Luoyang are very concerned about their close connection with the people of the entire liberated area and have begun to work with the democratic government to build this city of the people.

　　洛阳市民重获解放喜气洋洋
  　商店当晚便开门营业
  　街上行人川流不息物价大跌
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十三日电】前线记者报导洛阳市收复后盛况称：重获解放的洛阳市民，连日沉浸在胜利的狂欢中。我军一进城，许多商店就开门营业，所有戏院当晚即一律开演。街头整日象过节一样，行人川流不息，学生们最活跃，他们三五成群，寻找上次认识的解放军朋友。市民们也找他们上次认识的市府工作人员，诉说半月来蒋匪的种种暴行。新张贴的布告、传单和画报前面，终日拥挤着人群，他们抢着要宣传员手上的传单。这几天谈街巷议的话题，是两次解放洛阳的战斗，他们说：“毛主席的战法就是高。上次消灭了二○六师，打开仓库把老百姓救济了一遍。美国和蒋介石急急忙忙调兵遣将，解放军给让出一座空城，返回来又消灭了他一个团。”上次我军在洛阳停留时间虽短，但纪律良好，坚决保护工商业等模范行为，给市民留下了极深的印象。他们说：“解放军和气规矩，有礼貌，有知识，对老百姓真是秋毫无犯。”中山街一位姓耿的老先生，上次洛城解放时躲在乡下，这次却一定要和解放军见面谈话。他在街上邀请了宣传队的一位小同志到他家里，询问解放军情况，并且检举了一个隐藏的坏人。蒋匪重占的半月间，洛市各物飞涨，麦子一斗（十四斤）由蒋币三十万元涨到五十万元，猪肉由两万四千元涨到四万八。这次收复后的第一天，麦价猛跌，每斗仅冀币三千五百元，合蒋币二十一万。市民一见杨少桥市长就高兴地说：“杨市长，你们回来了，我们的生活有办法了。”冀币信用甚高，与蒋币比值为一比六十。北街军民戏院的票价，蒋币一万五，冀币只收二百元。市街蒋匪残存的工事都已拆除，城防部队每日打扫，市容焕然一新。蒋匪统治时期常有抢案发生，现民主秩序已开始建立，市民生活安定，每晚有许多人到市府前听陕北新华广播电台的广播。商人和学生都提出要看解放区的报，他们跑到“新洛阳报”的筹备处打听出版日期（按该报已于九日创刊）。洛阳十二万市民很关心和整个解放区人民的亲密联系，并已开始和民主政府共同建设这座人民的城市。
