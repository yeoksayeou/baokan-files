　　Overcoming Extreme Democracy
    In villages implementing land redistribution and party consolidation work in the Ninth District of Wu'an, efforts have been made to implement the spirit of democracy, mobilizing the masses to solve problems themselves. The democratic atmosphere has therefore become extremely high. The masses dare to raise opinions about anyone and are concerned about everything, fully demonstrating their stance as masters. The newly elected cadres have also swept away the bad practices of the old cadres, such as administrative orders and detachment from the masses, consulting with everyone on matters and conscientiously serving the masses. These are concrete manifestations of the democratic atmosphere, a driving force for promoting rural progress, and a major achievement in the land redistribution and party consolidation movement.

    However, in this process, there has been a deviation of misunderstanding democracy and moving towards extreme democracy. This is manifested in some people refusing to obey everyone's decisions and constantly arguing; some even submitting trivial personal matters for everyone to discuss; and a few individuals not obeying the leadership of the new cadres, etc. On the part of the new cadres, they dare not make decisions on matters, often convening meetings to discuss even small things, sometimes requiring four or five discussions to resolve them. This has caused distress to the masses, and the new cadres are also distressed. Therefore, a misconception has arisen, believing that "things are difficult to handle, no wonder the old cadres offended people!" This confuses the past lack of democracy by cadres with the deviations in the realization of democracy today. If these misconceptions are not corrected, one cannot recognize the achievements already made in the democratic movement; and on this basis, overcome deviations and make democratic life sound and consolidated.

    To overcome the deviation of extreme democracy, the main thing is to make the peasants understand the true meaning of democracy, telling them that democracy is not about not needing leadership, and democracy is not about not needing centralization. Educate the masses about the extreme democratic behavior of a few people who misunderstand democracy and force everyone to obey their individual will; and on the basis of raising mass awareness, gradually establish various systems and rules, requiring everyone to consciously abide by them, and consolidate and improve democratic life from both ideological and organizational perspectives. As for the new cadres, they must recognize that the reason why the past cadres made mistakes was because they were detached from the masses and did not care about the interests of the masses; they must recognize that as long as they are enthusiastic about serving the masses, they should not be afraid of making mistakes or offending people. In order to enhance their courage, they should boldly take responsibility and carry out their work.

### 克服极端民主

　　克服极端民主
    武安九区实行填补整党工作的村庄，都努力贯彻民主精神，发动群众起来自己解决问题，民主空气因此极为高涨，群众对谁有意见都敢提，对啥事都很关心，充分表现出主人翁的姿态。而新选的干部，亦一扫旧干部行政命令脱离群众的坏作风，有事与大家商量，兢兢业业的为群众服务。这些都是民主气象的具体表现，是推进农村进步的动力，是填补与整党运动中的一大成果。
    但在这当中，却发生了误解民主走向极端民主的偏向，表现在有些人遇事不服从大家决定，吵闹不休；有些则连私人小事，都要交大家讨论；有个别人则不遵从新干部领导等等。而在新干部方面，则遇事不敢作主，往往一件小事都要召开大会讨论，有的讨论四五次才能解决。引起群众苦恼，新干部也苦恼。因此就产生一种错觉，认为“事情不好办，怪不得旧干部得罪人！”把过去干部不民主与今天实现民主中的偏向混淆起来。这些错觉如不改正，就不能认识民主运动中已得成果；并在这个基础上去克服偏向，使民主生活健全与巩固起来。
    克服极端民主的偏向，主要是要使农民认识民主的真意义，告诉他们民主不是不要领导，民主不是不要集中。把少数人误解民主，而强制大家服从他个人的极端民主表现，向群众进行教育；并在群众觉悟提高的基础上，逐步定好各种制度和规矩，要求大家自觉遵守，从思想上及组织上，把民主生活巩固健全起来，而对新的干部，要他们认识过去干部所以会犯错误，是由于脱离群众，不关心群众利益；要他们认识，只要热心为群众服务，就不应怕犯错误，也不应怕得罪人。以提高他们的勇气，大胆负责，进行工作。
