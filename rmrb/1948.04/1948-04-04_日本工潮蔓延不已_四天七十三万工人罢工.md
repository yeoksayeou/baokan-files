Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: The wave of strikes by Japanese workers demanding wage increases continues to surge. From the 27th to the 30th of last month, the strike waves followed one after another. On the 27th, 300,000 government and public sector workers held a 24-hour general strike, of which 80,000 workers from Tokyo's state-owned enterprises continued their strike until the end of last month. At midnight on the 28th, 160,000 telecommunications workers in eastern Japan (including Tokyo) began a 24-hour strike. On the 28th, 65,000 coal miners in Hokkaido announced a one-day strike. 200,600 telecommunications workers in 29 western prefectures also staged a 48-hour strike on the 30th. The heroic strike struggle of Japanese workers has greatly alarmed the Japanese reactionary government and its backstage boss, MacArthur, who have colluded to carry out suppression. MacArthur's headquarters issued a reactionary strike ban on the 29th of last month; and ordered U.S. military police to cooperate with Japanese police to illegally arrest the chairman of the Tokyo Engineering and Repair Bureau branch of the Japan Transportation Workers' Union on the same day. The Japanese reactionary authorities dismissed four leaders of the Ministry of Finance Workers' Union and six senior staff members of the Tax Workers' Union, and threatened to "discipline strikers." However, the Japanese working class, disregarding this fascist high-pressure, still persisted in its unyielding struggle. After MacArthur's ban was issued, regional strikes continued one after another. The nationwide general strike originally scheduled by the Japan Transportation Workers' Union for the 31st of last month was cancelled on the 30th due to MacArthur's direct intervention, but it was still decided to continue regional strikes until the goal was achieved. Dobashi Katsukichi, chairman of the strike committee representing 1.5 million workers in state-owned transportation enterprises, declared on the 30th: "We will take all possible measures other than a general strike until we obtain the minimum living standard for workers." He angrily denounced the shameless intimidation of MacArthur and the reactionary authorities, and warned: "The working class cannot be suppressed by force."

　　日本工潮蔓延不已
  　四天七十三万工人罢工
    【新华社陕北二日电】东京讯：日本职工要求增资的罢工风潮，继续高涨。上月二十七日至三十日的四天中，罢工浪潮一波紧接一波。二十七日，三十万政府及公共机关等职工举行了二十四小时大罢工，其中八万东京国营企业工人连续罢工至上月底。二十八日午夜，日本东部（包括东京在内）电讯工人十六万人开始二十四小时罢工，二十八日北海道六万五千煤矿工人宣布罢工一日。西部二十九个县中的二十万零六千电讯工人，也于三十日实行四十八小时罢工。日本职工英勇的罢工斗争，已使日本反动政府及其后台老板麦克阿瑟大为慌乱不安，竟狼狈为奸实行镇压。麦克阿瑟总部于上月二十九日颁布反动的罢工禁令；且命令美国宪兵协同日本警察于同日非法拘捕日交通工会东京工程及修理局分会主席，日反动当局则将大藏省职工会领袖四人及税务员工会高级职员六人撤职，且以“纪律制裁罢工者”相威胁。但日本工人阶级不顾此种法西斯式的高压，仍坚持不屈的斗争。麦克阿瑟禁令发出后，地域性的罢工仍此起彼落。日本交通工会原定于上月三十一日举行的全国性总罢工，虽因麦克阿瑟之直接干涉而于三十日宣布取消，但仍决定继续进行地域性的罢工，不达目的不止。代表一百五十万国营交通企业工人的罢工委员会主席土桥胜吉三十日宣称：“我们将采取除总罢工以外一切可以想到的办法，直至获得工人的最低生活标准为止”。他怒斥麦克阿瑟与反动当局的无耻恫吓，并警告说：“工人阶级不是用武力能镇压得了的。”
