　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: The International Aid to Democratic Greece Conference, which opened here in Paris on the 10th, victoriously concluded on the 12th after passing a series of resolutions to aid the Greek people. Representatives from various countries and organizations spoke successively at the meeting, unanimously condemning the interventionist policies of the United States and Britain, and expressed deep sympathy for the Greek people. At the end of the meeting, a congratulatory telegram from the Greek Provisional Democratic Government was read aloud. The telegram was filled with the heroic fighting spirit of the Greek people. The telegram stated: "The Greek people are engaged in an arduous and just struggle against the forces of imperialism. Imperialism is spreading the seeds of death and destruction in Greece. As a result of their intervention, 50,000 Greek people have lost their lives, and more than 60,000 have been imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps and have lost their freedom. We will fight to the end until all of Greece is liberated." The conference assured the Greek people and the Provisional Democratic Government that the people of the world are completely united with them. The conference called on the people of the world to give them material and spiritual assistance and decided to establish a committee to maintain contact with aid-to-Democratic-Greece committees in various countries.
