    Villagers of Jiajia Village Understand the Land Law
    Speed Up Reclamation and Build Embankments and Dig Ditches
    [Shexian News] Jiajia Village in the Second District is a village with a large population and little land. The village has 56 households with 239 people, and 183 mu of dry and paddy fields, with an average of just over 7 fen of land per person (and it is sandy soil). Last year, the village reclaimed more than 90 mu of river滩land and planted rice. Some households harvested more than 4 shi of rice, and most households harvested 1 to 2 shi. Therefore, they are very enthusiastic about reclamation, and most people want to reclaim more. However, there are two concerns: one is the fear of river冲ing, and at the same time, they feel that there are many paddy fields and the canal entrances are small, so it is difficult to get water. The other is that after the Land Law Outline was released, it produced a passive idea of waiting for equal distribution. The general saying is "Wait and see." The poor peasants have fewer concerns and are eager to reclaim. Jia Erhai said: "This year, we are relying on the river滩! If we build a strong dike to withstand the river water, we can protect our river灘, that would be great." According to the needs of the masses, on the fifth night of the first lunar month, a meeting of mutual aid team leaders and above was held to study the reclamation problem. The plan was for the whole village to cooperate and jointly build a large water-blocking dike to protect the old river灘land and water land, and also reclaim another 2 qing of river灘land. If the canals are repaired, more grain can be harvested. On the sixth night of the first lunar month, another mass meeting was held to discuss with everyone. The deputy village chief explained the Land Law Outline to the masses, explaining that the newly reclaimed river滩land is protected and is not included in the equal distribution. Reclaiming灘land and opening barren slopes are the same, more grain is harvested without more burden. In this way, the concerns of the masses were initially eliminated. Then, the dike construction, canal excavation, and land reclamation plans studied by the cadres were put forward. After everyone discussed in groups, they unanimously agreed. The result of the discussion was to divide the work according to mutual aid teams to build dikes, excavate canals, and reclaim land in sections. On the seventh day, each group prepared furniture, and on the eighth day, work began. Each group competed to carry stones, and they worked very hard. After thirteen days, a large dike of 160 zhang long, 8 chi wide, and 5 chi high was built. Then, the work was divided to excavate canals. The total length of the canal is 491 zhang (the canal entrance is one zhang wide), and the plan is to complete it in three phases. The first phase of 125 zhang has been completed, and the second phase of 192 zhang is also about to be completed. There are still 174 zhang to be dug, and 200 mu of灘land can be reclaimed. According to the plan of each group this year, 100 mu can be completed. When the entire canal is completed in the future, it can irrigate 3 qing and a half of land. After this period, the production enthusiasm of the masses has been rising day by day. Sheep herders Li Lan停 and Li Gui喜 said: "Isn't this easy work?" During the day they didn't have time to herd sheep, so they took advantage of the moonlight at night to pick up stones for two and a half nights. In addition to participating in mutual aid reclamation, poor peasant Jia 随心 also reclaimed more than 3 mu of滩land by himself (mutual aid members reclaimed more than 1.5 mu each), and Zhao 小三 also reclaimed more than 2 mu. Poor peasant representative Li Gui禄 and his father plan to reclaim 10 mu this year, guaranteeing that 6 mu can be sown immediately. According to the statistics of each group, a total of more than 74 mu have been reclaimed. At present, in addition to completing the sowing of barren slopes, each group is turning to fully completing the excavation of canals, sorting out the old paddy fields, and completing the newly reclaimed滩land, preparing for sowing.

    [Taihang News] Taihang regions have achieved considerable success in water conservancy projects. Four canals have been built in Xijiangdong in Zan皇, Jialidian in Wu'an, Sucheng in Zuoquan, and Xiamahu in Neiqiu, which can irrigate nearly 1,000 mu of land. The Zhangnan Canal in Shexian has been under construction since last autumn, costing 34,600 labor days. After repairing the seven large bridges, more than 3,300 mu of land can be irrigated again. Anyang, Huixian, and the areas along the Qinhe and Danhe rivers in Bo'ai, Qinyang, and Wuzhi are actively repairing the dikes of the two rivers and their tributaries to prevent floods from breaching the dikes and causing disasters, and are preparing for irrigation.

    贾家庄群众明白了土地法
    加紧修滩筑堤挑渠
    【涉县消息】二区贾家庄是个人多地少的村子，全村五十六户，二三九口人，水旱地一八三亩，每人平均七分多地（且系沙土地）。去年全村修了九十多亩河滩地，种的稻子，有的户打四石多稻，一般户都打了一石至两石。因此对修滩劲头很大，大部群众都还想再修。但有两个顾虑：一是怕河冲，同时感到稻田多、渠口小，不很得水，也是个困难。另一个是土地法大纲下来后，产生了等待平分的消极思想，一般的说法是“等等再说吧”。贫农顾虑较少，则急着想修。贾二孩说：“今年全指凭着过河滩哩！要是扎道大堰，扛住河水，能保住咱这河滩，可是可以啊”。根据群众要求，今年正月初五黑夜就召开互助组长以上干部会，研究修滩问题，计划是全村互助，共同扎起一道大壁水堰，保住旧河滩地与水地，还能再修二顷来河滩地。再把水渠修好，就更能多打粮食。初六黑夜又召开群众会和大家商量，由副村长给群众讲解土地法大纲，说明对新修河滩是保护的，并不在平分里边数。修滩和开荒坡一样，多打了粮食不多出负担。这样，群众的顾虑初步消除。接着又提出干部们研究的扎堰、开渠、修滩计划。大家分组圪扯后，一致同意，商量的结果，是按互助组分工扎堰，分工开渠，分片修地。初七日各组准备家具，初八就开了工，各组竞赛着抬石头，干的挺有劲。一直干了十三天，扎起了一百六十丈长，八尺宽，五尺高的大堰，随即分工开渠，全渠共长四九一丈（渠口宽一丈），计划按三期完成。第一期已完成一二五丈，第二期一九二丈，也已快要完成。还有一七四丈未挑，能修的滩地二百亩，今年根据各组计划，可完成一百亩，全渠将来修成，可灌地三顷半。经过这一段，群众生产情绪一天比一天高涨起来，羊工李兰停、李贵喜说：“这还不受干啥哩？”白天放羊没工夫，黑夜趁月亮还去拾了两半夜石头。贫农贾随心除参加互助修滩外，自己另外又修了三亩多滩（互助每人新修一亩半多），赵小三也另修了二亩多。贫雇代表李贵禄和他父亲两个人，今年计划修出十亩，保证有六亩能马上下种。各组统计，现已修出共七十四亩多。目前各组除完成荒坡下种外，正都转向全部完成开渠，整理旧稻田，完成新修滩。准备下种。（崔起山、靳波）
    【太行消息】太行各地兴修水利，获得不少成绩。赞皇西江洞、武安贾里店、左权粟城、内邱下马河等地已修好四条渠，可浇地近千亩。涉县漳南大渠自去秋动工，费了三万四千六百来工，将七座大桥修好后，三千三百余亩地，又可上水。安阳、辉县及沁河、丹河沿岸博爱、沁阳、武陟，均在积极修理两河堤岸及支渠，防止河涨决堤成灾，并准备灌溉。
