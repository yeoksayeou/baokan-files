Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. The Mongolian People's Republic protests the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's provocative atrocities of February 25th. According to a TASS dispatch from Kulun on the 3rd, the "Unen" newspaper recently published a communique from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic as follows: On February 25, 1948, a squad of more than 70 Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) armed cavalrymen again attacked the Mongolian People's Republic border post in the Ihabaknuuru mountain area, penetrating 80 kilometers into the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic and looting residents of the Altai and Soyinna villages in the Kobdo region. After the Mongolian border guards took measures, the Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) troops were driven out of the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic. In this new armed invasion, Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) soldiers killed one Mongolian farmer, injured several others, and drove away 26 camels and 50 sheep. In view of this, the Mongolian People's Republic has lodged a protest with the Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) government, demanding that measures be taken to prevent similar illegal actions by Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) troops in the future. The Mongolian People's Republic reserves its right to demand that the Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) government fully compensate the Mongolian side for the losses suffered due to the continuous harassment by Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek bandit) troops. This is the third provocation made by Chiang Kai-shek bandits against the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic this year. On January 22nd and 28th, Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops invaded the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic twice, and the Mongolian People's Republic lodged a protest with Chiang Kai-shek bandits on February 25th.

　　蒋匪军非法越境抢劫扰乱
  　蒙古共和国提出抗议
    【新华社陕北六日电】蒙古人民共和国抗议蒋匪军队二月二十五日挑衅暴行。据塔斯社库伦三日电称：“乌尼恩”报顷发表蒙古人民共和国外交部公报如下：一九四八年二月二十五日，中国（蒋匪）武装骑兵一队七十余人复进袭伊哈巴克努鲁山区的蒙古人民共和国边防哨，并深入蒙古人民共和国领土达八十公里，掠夺科布多区的阿尔泰、梭英纳村的居民。由于蒙古边防哨采取措施后，中国（蒋匪）部队乃被逐出蒙古人民共和国领土以外。在此次新的武装侵袭中，中国（蒋匪）兵士杀死蒙古农民一人，另有农民数人受伤，赶走骆驼二十六匹、羊五十只。蒙古人民共和国有鉴于此，乃向中国（蒋匪）政府提出抗议，要求采取措施以防止将来中国（蒋匪）部队类似的非法行动发生。蒙古人民共和国保留其要求中国（蒋匪）政府完全赔偿蒙古方面因中国（蒋匪）部队不断袭扰而遭受损失的权利。按此为蒋匪今年向蒙古人民共和国领土所作之第三次挑衅，一月二十二日及二十八日蒋匪军曾两次侵入蒙古人民共和国领土，蒙古人民共和国已于二月二十五日向蒋匪提出抗议。
