(Yongnian News) Ma Gu, in the Fourth District, switched from filling gaps to spring plowing production according to the demands of the masses. From the time the work team arrived in the village on March 15th, they were always engaged in filling gaps, never touching the hearts of the masses, making it impossible for people of all social strata to understand the true situation. Poor peasants still just wanted to divide the land well, and middle peasants were afraid of being disrupted by equal distribution. They were all playing chess on the streets and not producing. The well-to-do middle peasants even went to the poor peasant groups to request to give up several acres of land voluntarily. Later, Duan Youchang, a member of the poor peasant group, said: "In last year's struggle, the poor peasants all got a share of land. At present, we should seize the opportunity to engage in production. I don't think the masses have much enthusiasm for filling gaps." This reminded the work team. They immediately made an inspection and found that they had not done their work according to the demands of the masses and had taken a detour. Everyone studied and decided to listen to the demands of the masses and turn to production. Immediately, a mass meeting was held to announce that the work of filling gaps would be put off for the time being, and large-scale production would be carried out immediately. They also emphasized and publicized that whoever plants it will harvest it. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses was raised. Four poor peasants, three middle peasants, and two women were elected to form a production committee. Duan Youchang, of the poor peasant group, also expressed his attitude to the middle peasants: We will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's words and unite forever. This meeting was exactly what the masses wanted, and the enthusiasm for production was very high! The whole village finished delivering manure in three days and voluntarily joined forces to water the wheat seedlings. Sixty-year-old Zheng Shangjie and his wife and children watered four mu in three days. The middle peasant Gao Jinsheng said: "Now I understand 'When the East shines, it snows heavily', let's work hard." He went to the fields to dig sweet potato ditches and didn't go home until the stars came out. Yang Tongde, Yang Deke, and Duan Youcai helped each other and watered two mu in one day. Deke's father, who was seventy-eight years old, also went to the field to change the ridges. The middle peasant Zheng Suode had wanted to drill a well for a long time but didn't dare to. Now he also hired a master and started. There were still many difficulties for the poor peasants. The government provided 3,000 jin of production grain and some textile grain as loans. The village also had more than 1,000 jin of fruit grain, which was distributed to solve the production difficulties of the poor peasants. Now everyone is busy watering wheat and plowing and harrowing the land. Some households have already begun to sow sorghum.

    马固听取群众意见
    暂停填补转入春耕
    中贫农生产带了劲
    【永年消息】四区马固，按着群众要求，由填补又转入春耕生产。从三月十五号工作组到村，一直就搞填补，总没碰群众的心眼，使各阶层群众摸不清实底，贫农还是光想分好地，中农怕打乱平分，都在街上下棋不生产，中农高臭的还找贫农团要求自动几亩地。后来贫农团委员段有长说：“去年斗争，贫农都分了一部分地，目下应该抓紧搞生产，我看群众搞填补的劲头不大。”这一下提醒了工作组，即时作了检查，没有按着群众的要求搞工作，走了弯路，大家研究听取群众要求转向生产。随即召开群众大会，宣布填补工作往后放一放，马上进行大生产，又强调宣传了谁种谁收。这一来群众情绪提高，选举了四个贫农三个中农两个妇女成立了生产委员会，贫农团段有长又向中农表明态度：坚决执行毛主席的话，咱们永远团结。这个会正合群众的心意了，生产劲头可大啦！全村三天就把粪都送完了，自动搁伙浇麦苗。六十岁的郑尚节和他老婆小孩，三天浇完了四亩，中农高尽升说：“这一下‘东方亮下大雪’明白了，撑劲干吧”他下地掘瓜沟，星星出来了才回家。杨同得、杨得科、段有菜三人互助，一天浇了二亩，七十八岁的得科爹也下地改畦子。中农郑锁得，早想锥井就是不敢，这也请了师傅下了手。贫农还有很多困难，政府贷给了三千斤生产粮，一部分纺织粮，村里还有果实粮一千多斤，分配下去，解决了贫农的生产困难。现在都忙着浇麦、犁耙地，有的户已经开始耩高粮。
