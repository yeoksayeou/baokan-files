　　Regardless of Poverty, Hired Labor, or Middle Peasants
  　Loans Granted to Whoever Has Difficulties
  　Taziyu Implements Mass Line for Spring Loans
    [Shahe News] Taziyu Village, Shahe Third District, has 450,000 yuan in spring plowing loans. Initially, due to insufficient clarity in communicating the loan policy to the masses, people self-reported, resulting in a total request of 1,300,200 yuan. The cadres were worried but dared not, as in the past, dictate who could borrow, who could not, or how much. Another mass meeting and a mutual aid team leader meeting were held, and they deliberated for two nights without finding a solution. However, the masses were already discussing privately, assessing who should and should not be eligible for loans. The village cadres seized upon this sentiment, explaining that the purpose of the loans was to solve the difficulties of those who wanted to produce but couldn't, and that the loans were not limited to the poor and hired laborers but also extended to middle peasants facing production difficulties. Subsequently, at the meeting, people reported their difficulties, purposes, and loan amounts. Fifty-two households reported a total of 780,000 yuan, which was then divided into three groups to compare difficulties, purposes, and timelines. During the evaluation, some said: "Whoever feels they don't have as much difficulty as others or that their difficulties are not significant should voluntarily propose to reduce or eliminate their loan amount," promoting the spirit of class friendship. Following this, several households, driven by the spirit of helping those with greater difficulties with lesser difficulties, those with fewer loans helping those with more, and those with delayed needs helping those with urgent needs, voluntarily offered to reduce their amounts. For example, Jian Nian said, "Because I have a lot of land, I can't manage sideline occupations with the 10,000 yuan I requested. Eliminate my 10,000 yuan." However, some proposed halving all amounts. For example, Xi Liang's loan of 20,000 yuan was not supposed to be reduced, but some suggested reducing it by 5,000 yuan, others by 10,000 yuan. Seeing this bias, Genfu immediately said: "We can't just reduce the amounts of those who borrowed more." The masses felt that Genfu's suggestion was correct, saying, "Let's go by actual need, reduce what should be reduced, and add what should be added." Tan Gui's parents had just arrived from Shanxi a few days ago and were facing great difficulties. He requested 10,000 yuan, and the masses added another 10,000 yuan for him. After another round of evaluation, 35 households borrowed a total of 385,000 yuan, of which two poor and hired laborer households who had not yet turned themselves around borrowed 30,000 yuan, 30 new middle peasant households borrowed 305,000 yuan, and five old middle peasant households borrowed 50,000 yuan. 220,000 yuan of the loans were used for sideline occupations, and 155,000 yuan were used to purchase farm implements, textile tools, and raw materials; the remaining 65,000 yuan was unanimously agreed to be loaned to women to buy looms since there were few looms for women to weave cloth. After the loans were issued, two or three people in the mutual aid teams discussed production. Three teams have already collected more than 300,000 yuan. (Production Team, Wan Ying, Zheng Min)
    [Shahe News] In order to more effectively promote and organize production and issue spring loans, the Shahe Branch of the Jinnan Bank criticized and reviewed past errors in lending. In the past, due to insufficient and unclear policy research, there were left-leaning and right-leaning tendencies.
    First, in the first half of last year, emphasis was placed on production. In terms of loan targets, poor and hired peasants, new and old middle peasants (and individual landlords and rich peasants) were treated equally, regardless of the size of production difficulties, resulting in the poor and hired peasants not receiving the loans they deserved; as a result, cooperatives misused funds, and cadres embezzled and over-occupied funds.
    Second, in winter, emphasis was placed on lending only to the poor and hired peasants, not to the middle peasants, which pitted the middle peasants against the poor peasants in terms of loan policy, causing dissatisfaction among the middle peasants. For example, the Xigequan Credit Cooperative loaned 200,000 yuan, of which 80,000 yuan was loaned to four households including middle peasant Hao Yongfu, etc. Before the due date, it was forcibly recovered and re-loaned to the poor and hired laborers, causing extreme unease among the middle peasants. After review, it was recognized that this was due to not proceeding from a complete class perspective, which caused great losses to the county's loans, and it was decided to correct this in the spring loans.

### 不论贫雇中农谁有困难谁贷　塔子峪群众路线放春贷

　　不论贫雇中农
  　谁有困难谁贷
  　塔子峪群众路线放春贷
    【沙河消息】沙河三区塔子峪村有四十五万元春耕贷款，开始因向群众宣传贷款政策不够清楚，即让群众自报，一下报了一百三十万零二千元，干部上了愁，但也不敢再象过去一样，说谁能贷谁不能贷谁贷多少。又开了一次群众会，一次互助组长会，熬了两夜也没商量出个办法来。但群众已在背地交谈，谁不应贷谁该贷，进行暗评。村干便抓住群众这一精神，说明这次贷款是为了解决想生产而不能的困难，但也不是只贷贫雇，不贷给生产有困难的中农。接着在会场上报困难、用途、贷款数，五十二户共报了七十八万元，便分三组进行比困难、比用途、比时光。在评比中，有的说：谁感到没有别人困难或困难不大，自动提出去掉或去一部分，发扬阶级友爱精神。接着便有几户在小困难帮助大困难、少贷帮助多贷人、缓用帮助急用的友爱精神下，自动提出叫去掉，如见年说：“因我地多，我报的一万元也顾不过搞副业，把我的一万去了吧。”但又有人提出要去都去一半，如喜良贷的二万元，本来不应去，可是有说去五千元，有说去一万元吧。根福看到这种偏向，马上便说：咱们不能看谁贷的多了就给谁去。群众认为根福提的意见很对，都说咱按实际，该去就去，谁该添即添。谈贵他爹娘刚从山西下来没几天，很困难，他报的一万元，群众又给他加了一万元，又评了一遍，结果三十五户共贷了三十八万五千元，其中尚未翻透身的两户贫雇，贷了三万元，三十户新中贷了三十万零五千，五户老中农贷了五万。贷款用于搞副业的二十二万元，用于买农具和纺织工具及原料的十五万五千元；下剩的六万五千元，因妇女织布机少，大家一致意见贷给妇女买织布机用。款贷下后，三个两个在互助组内，便商量生产，有三组已集了三十多万元。（生产队、万英、政民）
    【沙河消息】冀南银行沙河支行为了更有力的推动与组织生产，发放春贷，批判与检讨了过去贷款上的错误，过去因研究政策不够彻底明确，发生了偏左偏右的倾向。
    一是去年上半年主要强调生产，在贷款对象上，将贫雇农和新旧中农（个别地富）等平列看待，不分生产困难大小等问题，使贫雇没得到应得之贷款；结果合作挪用、干部侵占多占。
    二是在冬季时又强调了只贷贫雇不贷中农，使中贫农在贷款政策上对立起来，惹起中农不满。如西葛泉信用社贷款二十万元，贷给中农郝永福等四户款八万元，不到期即强迫收回，转贷给贫雇手里，中农极不安。经检讨后，认识是没有从完整的阶级观点出发，使全县贷款受损失很大，决在春贷中改正。
