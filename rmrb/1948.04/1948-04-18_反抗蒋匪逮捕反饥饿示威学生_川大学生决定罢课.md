Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Nanjing dispatch: Students at Central University here continue their anti-hunger struggle, demanding full public funding. Student representatives from the university held a press conference at the university's engineering college at 7:00 PM on the 13th, stating that self-funded and partially publicly funded students are facing dire economic pressure and will run out of food starting on the 15th. They have repeatedly requested full public funding from the Chiang Kai-shek party and the university authorities, but without result. The university recently proposed a so-called "work-study subsidy" which is not a thorough solution. They are determined to continue demanding a satisfactory resolution.

Another report from Shanghai, 12th: In Chengdu, during the anti-hunger demonstration on the 9th, 130 students were arrested, including 20 female students, and three were beaten by Chiang's police. It is claimed that the just movement of students against hunger and oppression "has begun to spread throughout (Chiang-controlled) China" (Associated Press).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: According to various reports, students at Sichuan University in Chengdu have decided to hold a just strike against oppression and hunger, to protest the Chiang Kai-shek bandit police's arrest of 130 students and the beating of students during the anti-hunger demonstration in Chengdu on the 9th, and to demand the immediate release of the arrested students and severe punishment for those responsible for the violence. It is reported that the anti-hunger demonstration in Chengdu was triggered by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' refusal to meet the students' demand for rationed, subsidized rice. Participants included students from Sichuan University, West China University, and Chenghua University. In addition to ordering the police to beat the students, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities arrested 130 students that day, 32 of whom are reportedly facing fascist "military trial." Furthermore, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are now preparing to conduct a second bloody arrest, and their "blacklist" includes 50 students from the three universities.

　　反抗蒋匪逮捕反饥饿示威学生
  　川大学生决定罢课
    【新华社陕北十四日电】南京讯：此间中大学生继续反饥饿斗争，要求全面公费。该校学生代表十三日下午七时在该校工学院内举行记者招待会，谓该校自费及半公费生所受经济压迫已达绝境，十五日起即将断炊，迭向蒋党校方要求全公费，迄无结果；最近校方提出所谓“工读补助费”办法实不能彻底解决问题，决继续要求，直到问题获得圆满解决为止。
    另据上海十二日消息：成都学生九日反饥饿示威游行中、学生被捕者达一三○人，其中二十名为女生，并有三人被蒋警殴伤。据称：学生反饥饿反压迫正义运动，“已开始蔓延全中国（蒋区）各地”（美联社）。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据各方报导：成都四川大学学生已决定举行反压迫反饥饿正义罢课，以抗议蒋匪警察在九日成都学生反饥饿示威游行中逮捕学生一三○人及殴打学生暴行，并要求立即释放被捕学生严惩暴行负责者。据悉：成都学生反饥饿游行系因蒋匪拒绝学生要求配售平价米而起，参加者有四川、华西、成华等三大学学生。蒋匪当局除迫令警察殴打学生外，当日又逮捕学生一三○人，其中有三十二人传将受法西斯“军法审判”。又讯：蒋匪现正准备进行第二次血腥逮捕，其“黑名单”包括三大学学生达五十名。
