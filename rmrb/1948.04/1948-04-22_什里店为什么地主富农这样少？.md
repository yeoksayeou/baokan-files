To the Editor:

The article on class division in Shili Village in issue 677 of the newspaper states that out of 421 households in the village, there is only one landlord and one old rich peasant. How can this be? I hope you can tell me why there are so few landlords and rich peasants.

Comrade Ruoyu:

In Shili Village, the land is relatively scattered. Before the establishment of the democratic government, landlords and rich peasants accounted for less than eight percent. Some rich peasant households changed their composition under the influence of the democratic government's policies. Therefore, the result of this division is only one operating landlord and one rich peasant. It must be noted here that class division must be based on the actual situation. Chairman Mao said in "The Present Situation and Our Tasks": "The proportion of landlords and rich peasants in the rural population, although varying, generally accounts for about eight percent (calculated by household)." This refers to the general situation, not that every village is eight percent, but varies. Especially in the old liberated areas, in the past few years, some landlords and rich peasants have changed their composition under the influence of the democratic government's policies, and the general proportion of less than eight percent is very common. When dividing classes, we must absolutely not subjectively have the idea that landlords and rich peasants must account for a certain number of households. That would be very dangerous. Comrade Ren Bishi said very clearly in "Several Questions in Land Reform" regarding the standards for dividing rural classes: "...We must divide classes and carry out land reform according to the actual situation. We must never artificially classify people who are not landlords and rich peasants as landlords and rich peasants, mistakenly expand the scope of attack, disrupt the revolutionary ranks, help the enemy, and isolate ourselves. This is an extremely important issue that must be brought to the attention of all comrades in the Party." (Shili Village Work Team)

### 什里店为什么地主富农这样少？

　　什里店为什么地主富农这样少？编辑同志：
    六七七期报上登的什里店划阶级一文中，该村四二一户，只有地主一户，旧富农一户，是怎么回事？望赐复地主富农这样少的原因是荷。
  　若宇
    若宇同志：什里店因土地比较分散，民主政府成立以前地主富农就不到百分之八，有几户富农又在民主政府政策影响下改变了成份，所以这次划的结果只有经营地主一户，富农一户。在这里必须注意，划阶级必须根据实际情况，毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”中说：“地主富农在乡村人口中所占的比例，虽然有多有少，但按一般情况来说，大约只占百分之八左右（以户为单位计算）”，这里指的是一般情况，并不是每一个村子都是百分之八，而是有多有少的。特别在老解放区，几年以来，有些地主富农受民主政府政策影响已改变了成份，一般的比例数不到百分之八的很多。在划阶级时，绝对不敢先主观地存有地主富农一定要占多少户的想法，那样是十分危险的。任弼时同志在“土地改革中的几个问题”中，根据什么标准来划分农村阶级一节中说的很明确：“……我们必须按照实际情形去划分阶级，进行土改，决不可将本来不是地主富农的人们，人为地划成地主富农，错误地扩大打击面，打乱革命阵线，帮助敌人，孤立自己。这是一个极端重大的问题，必须引起全党同志的注意”。（什里店工作组）
