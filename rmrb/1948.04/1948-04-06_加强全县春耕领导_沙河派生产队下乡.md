　　Strengthen Spring Farming Leadership Throughout the County
　　Shahe Sends Production Teams to the Countryside

　　[Shahe News] To strengthen spring farming leadership, this county convened a meeting of over a hundred production propaganda team members from the 19th to the 23rd of last month. The three propaganda teams were reorganized into seven production work teams (one for each district) to go to various districts and promote mass production. After the county's cadres were reorganized, six work teams were organized to go to thirty-two (one-eighth of the county) different types of villages to carry out party rectification, promote democracy, and complete land redistribution, creating typical experiences. Additionally, over fifty cadres formed three propaganda teams to go to villages where party rectification, democracy promotion, and land redistribution were not being carried out, to conduct propaganda work, stabilize the production mood of the masses, and achieve significant results. For example, after the propaganda team went to Lǜshuǐchí Village and publicized the joint instructions of the county government and the county federation of cooperatives, the masses raised another 200,000 yuan in shares. In Xīnzhuāng, the odd amounts of past shares were rounded up to whole numbers. In Zhāngzhuāng, a family of a soldier who had received 13 bags of grain last year had wasted it all. After hearing the propaganda, he said, "If you had come a few days earlier, I wouldn't have eaten all this grain. My family of two is short of some grain, but it doesn't matter if we produce well in the future." After the propaganda in this village, three households immediately started building houses and planting over three thousand trees. After the propaganda in Bālǐzhuāng, Zhāng Héniú, Yáng Àilián, and others bought three mules for transportation. After the propaganda in Liángzhuāng, the masses said they were no longer afraid, that this was a road three zhang six chi wide, and they could go out without a road permit. In the past, they said that one wrong word could make you a spy. One household told a worker, "After you came and held this meeting, I can probably eat now. I planted twenty-one trees in one morning." After hearing the propaganda, Zhāng Lǎopiān, a middle peasant in Jìzhuāng, said, "Look at my house, it's already unlivable. In the past, I was afraid of the land law and didn't dare to build it, but now I'm not afraid and I want to repair it." Hóu Liángguì's group in Bālǐzhuāng planted over eight hundred trees; after the propaganda in Dùkǒu, they repaired seventy-two mu of river滩, reclaimed fifty-two mu of virgin land, twenty-six mu of abandoned farmland, and planted two hundred and sixty trees. From the above, it can be seen that the masses are eager to produce. In villages severely affected by disasters, the masses urgently demand production to overcome the famine and solve the current difficulties in eating and drinking. For example, women in Guānzhuāng requested spinning and weaving and were willing to have the cooperative organize and lead them, help them purchase raw materials, and sell finished products.

　　Due to the urgency of the spring farming season and the severity of the disaster throughout the county, with about 70,000 people affected by famine out of the county's population of 150,000, accounting for nearly half of the county's population, and in terms of area, disaster-stricken villages account for more than half of the county. The current spring farming production, organizing the masses to overcome the famine, is also a very important task. After studying the current work, the propaganda team was immediately changed into a production work team, dispatched to various districts to lead and organize the masses to produce and overcome the famine, and vigorously promote spring farming.

　　Rectify Mutual Aid, Implement Voluntarism, Correct Coercion and Commandism

　　In organizational guidelines, implement the policy of relying on poor and hired peasants and uniting with middle peasants in production. Establish a production committee in the village, regardless of new or old cadres, new or old middle peasants, poor peasants or hired laborers, based on the following conditions: (1) upright character, (2) selfless, (3) engaged in labor year-round, (4) having prestige among the masses, and (5) democratic work style and experience in leading production. Select these individuals to form a production committee to lead production throughout the village. It was decided to concentrate the responsibility for promoting production in the production committee, rectify mutual aid, implement voluntarism, correct the bad work style of coercing and commanding the masses, and solve the problems left over from last year economically, organizationally, and ideologically. In villages where land was used as shares last year, such as Kāngchuān and Dùkǒu, the masses complained that it was "three lines of blockade," "saying '耕三余一耕三余一' is 'tāmāde 耕三脱一耕三脱一'!" [耕三余一耕三余一 can be literally translated as "cultivate three and have one left over", 耕三脱一耕三脱一 can be translated as "cultivate three and lose one."] The production mood of the poor and lower-middle peasants was not high. What was previously called creativity actually developed into blindness and destructiveness. Therefore, in this rectification, solicit the opinions of the masses. If they are willing to do it, let them do it; if they are not willing to do it, don't force them. There should be no more coercion. The old institutions of the past are also acknowledged, but it must be explained that there are good and bad aspects to them. If they can lead production well in the future, they can atone for their sins. They must change their work style. The masses especially oppose bad cadres, and others can be elected. The poor peasant leagues established last winter generally are not disbanded, but at the same time, they are not trusted. Individual bad ones can be removed (the wording should also be careful, not canceling the poor peasant league, but canceling bad leadership; do not listen to old cadres).

### 加强全县春耕领导　沙河派生产队下乡

　　加强全县春耕领导
  　沙河派生产队下乡
    【沙河消息】为加强春耕领导，本县于上月十九至二十三日召开生产宣传队百余人会议，把三个宣传队改组为七个生产工作队（每区一个）分赴各区推动群众生产。本县干部经整编后，组织六个工作队分赴三十二个（占全县八分之一）不同类型村进行整党、民主和填补工作，创造典型经验，另由五十多个干部，组成三个宣传队，赴不搞整党民主和填补的村庄，进行宣传工作，安定群众生产情绪，收获很大。如宣传队到绿水池村进行宣传县府县联社的联合指示后，群众又集股二十万元。辛庄把过去股金零数加成整数，张庄有一户抗属去年收粮十三袋，现在浪费完了，经宣传后他说：“你们早来几天我也吃不了这些粮食，俺家两口人缺些粮食，今后好好生产也不要紧。”该村经宣传后，马上有三户盖房子，栽树三千余棵。八里庄经宣传后，张和牛、杨爱连等买骡三头去运输，良庄经宣传后，群众说这就不怕了，这是三丈六尺宽的路，出门不开路条，过去说差一句话就是特务。有一户跟工作员说：“你来开了这次会，俺可能吃下去饭了，一上午栽树二十一棵。”冀庄中农张老偏听宣传后说：“你看我这房子，已不能住，过去怕土地法不敢盖，这回才不害怕可要修理一下。”八里庄侯良贵组栽树八百余棵；渡口经宣传后，修河滩七十二亩、生荒五十二亩、熟荒二十六亩、栽树二百六十棵。从以上看来，说明群众是要求生产的。而灾情严重的村，群众迫切要求生产渡荒，解决当前吃喝上困难，如官庄妇女要求纺织，愿意叫合作社组织领导她们，帮助她们收买原料，推销成品。
    由于春耕时间紧迫与全县灾情严重，全县十五万人口，灾荒约占七万人，几占全县人口的一半，在面积上，灾荒村占全县一半还多，目前的春耕生产，组织群众渡荒也是一件非常重大的事情，宣传队研究了当前工作后，并即改为生产工作队，分赴各区领导组织群众生产渡荒，大力推进春耕。
    整顿互助贯彻自愿　纠正强制群众作风
    在组织路线上，贯彻依靠贫雇团结中农生产方针。在村成立生产委员会，不管新老干部、新老中农、贫雇，看条件：（一）为人正派，（二）大公无私，（三）常年劳动，（四）在群众中有威信，（五）作风民主、领导生产有经验的人，选出来组织成生产委员会来领导全村生产。决定将推动生产责任集中在生产委员会，整顿互助，贯彻自愿，纠正强制群众的坏作风，从经济上、组织上、思想上解决去年遗留问题。在去年曾实行土地入股的村庄，如康川、渡口等村，群众反映说是“三道封锁线”，“说什么耕三余一，是他妈的耕三脱一！”中贫农生产情绪都不高，过去被称为创造性，实际发展成了盲目性、破坏性。所以在这次整顿中，征求群众意见，愿干就干，不愿干就不干，不能再有任何强制。对过去旧机构也承认，要说明这里边有好的有坏的，如今后能好好领导生产，将来可将功折罪，非得转变自己作风不行，群众特别反对的坏干部也可另选。对去年冬成立的贫雇团一般的不宣布解散，同时也不相信他，个别太坏的可以取消（说法上也要注意，不是取消贫雇团，是取消坏领导，不能听旧干部话）。
