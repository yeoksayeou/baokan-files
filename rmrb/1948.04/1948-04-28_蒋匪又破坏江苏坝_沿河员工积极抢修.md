Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 26th— After Chiang Kai-shek bandits sabotaged the Jiangsu Dam hazardous section in Juancheng three times, on the 15th, bandit's 55th division suddenly attacked the dam, dispersing our employees who were repairing the new No. 2 dam hazardous section, causing the "mattress" of the new No. 2 dam to "drop," and now that place is in danger of collapsing and breaching at any time. Furthermore, the Gao Village hazardous section in Dongming has been continuously sabotaged by Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents since February 20th, cutting off twenty "bottom hook ropes" made of iron wire from the seventh dam. After we repaired them, on April 16th, a part of Chiang Kai-shek's 68th Division cut off ten more "bottom hook ropes" and threw them into the river. Now the dam is also constantly "dropping mattresses" and is in a state of danger.

Chiang Kai-shek bandits not only sabotage the hazardous sections of the Liberated Areas, but also allow the dikes and hazardous sections in the areas they occupy to collapse without repairing them. A section of the Lin-Huang dike in Leiji, Lanfeng, was completely scoured away in this year's peach flood. Now the Yellow River water is scouring the high ground 200 meters wide outside the Lin-Huang dike. If this high ground is washed away, it will inevitably cause a disastrous breach, and Juancheng, Cao, Shan, Feng, Pei and other counties will be flooded, but Chiang Kai-shek bandits still ignore it. At present, the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas and the employees along the river are rising up to carry out a resolute struggle for emergency repairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Jidong, 26th—The masses in the areas of Jidong frequently affected by floods are actively repairing river dikes with the help of the democratic government. The Taihewa and Lin Nancangwa areas in Yutian County have been unable to cultivate for several years due to continuous floods, and 300,000 mu were flooded again last year. After the water was drained in mid-March, 150,000 mu were exposed in half a month. Now the land is being exposed at a rate of more than 1,000 mu per day. The democratic government has loaned 15,000 jin of wheat seeds to help the masses plant spring wheat. The masses believe that the reduction of river work will allow them to engage in more farming, and the reduction of reed fields will also reduce the damage caused by wild ducks. This year's income will definitely increase significantly. The closure of the Maying Water Depression in Baodi County has been completed after more than four months of repairs. Although it collapsed twice during this period, it was finally completed due to the efforts of the workers. The democratic government allocated a total of more than 115,000 yuan in wages, more than 187,200 jin of wheat, more than 15,000 jin of millet, 8,000 reed mats, 2,400 wooden stakes, and more than 24,300 jin of firewood. It is now also planning to open canals to release water from the depression to permanently prevent floods. Luannan (newly established county) is blocking the breach in Anniudian, clearing the silt in the riverbed, and raising the river dikes. More than 30 li of river dikes south of Anniudian have been completely repaired. It is estimated that after the completion of the entire project, 37 flood-affected villages and 7 half-disaster villages in the county will be spared from flooding.

    蒋匪又破坏江苏坝
    沿河员工积极抢修
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫廿六日电】蒋匪三次破坏我鄄城江苏坝险工之后，十五日匪五十五师又突袭该坝，驱散我正在抢修险工新二坝的员工，致使新二坝“掉垫”，现该处随时有覆没决口的危险。又东明高村险工，自二月二十日以来，被蒋匪特务连续破坏，割断第七坝铁丝制成的“底钩绳”二十根。经我修好后，四月十六日，蒋匪六十八师一部又将“底钩绳”割断十根，并丢到河里。现该坝也不断“掉垫”，险象环生。
    蒋匪不仅破坏解放区险工，即对其侵占区的堤坝险工，亦任其倾塌不加修筑，兰封雷集的临黄堤，已有一段在今年桃汛中，全部被淘刷。现黄水正冲刷临黄堤外二百公尺宽的高地，此一高地如被冲刷掉，必造成决口大祸，鄄城、曹、单、丰、沛等县都将遭淹没，而蒋匪至今仍听任不管。现解放区军民及沿河员工正奋起进行坚决抢修斗争。
    【新华社冀东二十六日电】冀东时遭水灾地区群众，在民主政府帮助下，积极修理河堤。玉田县太和洼与林南仓洼各地因连遭水灾，已数年未能耕种，去年复被淹三十万亩，三月中旬开始泄水后，半个月露出十五万亩，现该地每天能露出千余亩，民主政府已贷发麦种一万五千斤，帮助群众种上春麦。群众以河工减少，可多务耕耘，苇地也减少野鸭踏害，今年收入定将大量增加。宝坻县马营水洼堵口经四个多月的修理，其间虽曾崩塌两次，由于工人们的努力，终已全部完竣。民主政府共拨工资十一万五千余元，麦子十八万七千二百余斤，小米一万五千余斤，及席片八千张，木桩二千四百余根，柴二万四千三百余斤。现并计划开渠放淀，以永防水灾。滦南（新设县）正堵筑暗牛淀决口，清理河床淤塞及加高河堤，暗牛淀以南三十余里河堤已全部修好，预计全部工程完成后，该县三十七个水灾村及七个半灾村，即可免于水患。
