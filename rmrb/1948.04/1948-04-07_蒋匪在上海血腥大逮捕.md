　　Chiang Kai-shek's Bloody Arrests in Shanghai

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits carried out bloody arrests on a large scale on the eve of the opening of the puppet National Assembly. According to a TASS report, in Shanghai alone, on the 25th, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits arrested more than a hundred patriotic democratic figures and ordinary people. Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency also admitted that, as of the 26th, more than 160 workers had been arrested, and the number of people on Chiang Kai-shek's "blacklist" reached more than 400, and arrests are still continuing. The Chiang Kai-shek gang's pig-selling National Assembly, under the guise of "constitutional government," opened yesterday (29th). The large-scale arrests of patriotic democratic elements and residents in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas, starting from Shanghai, are an annotation to Chiang Kai-shek's "constitutional government."

　　蒋匪在上海血腥大逮捕
    【新华社陕北三十日电】蒋匪伪国大开幕前夕大肆血腥逮捕。据塔斯社报导：仅二十五日一日内，蒋匪在上海一地即捕去爱国民主人士及普通老百姓百余人。蒋匪中央社亦供认：至二十六日止，已捕去工人一百六十余人，蒋匪“黑名单”内人数达四百余名，目前仍继续进行逮捕中。按蒋家匪帮以“行宪”为名的猪仔国民大会已于昨（二十九）日开幕，从上海开始的对蒋区爱国民主分子及居民的大规模逮捕，就是蒋匪“行宪”的一个注解。
