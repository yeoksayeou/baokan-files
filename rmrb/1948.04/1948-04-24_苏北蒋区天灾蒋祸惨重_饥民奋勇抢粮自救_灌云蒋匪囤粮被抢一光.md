Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: According to reports from various sources, in the Chiang-occupied towns and villages along the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, including Xinpu, Haizhou, Lianyungang, and Guanyun, for nearly a hundred miles, starving people have universally launched struggles against hunger and to seize grain. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits and natural disasters are serious in this area. The salt industry in Lianyungang has also declined, leaving more than 100,000 salt workers with no way to make a living. However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits continue to cruelly extort from the disaster victims, adding donation checkpoints outside the city gates of Haizhou. Disaster victims who enter the city to sell grass to survive must donate 15,000 yuan in travel expenses. Si Xiaotang's family in Guanyun sold two children for 490,000 yuan in Chiang Kai-shek currency, which was only enough to buy 15 kilograms of corn, not even enough to pay the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' "military expenses." Under the extortion of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, many people have starved to death. In a single township in the suburbs of Guanyun, 500 people have already starved to death. As early as February, starving people in Guanyun and other places rose up and organized "grain seizure teams," with thirty to fifty people in each team, to borrow grain from landlords and local bullies. However, Ji Yuzhi, the eighth district commissioner of Chiang Kai-shek's Jiangsu Province, ordered that "anyone who seizes grain will be killed without mercy." By mid-March, the disaster victims' grain seizure movement had surged even higher. The disaster victims shouted slogans such as "Better to fight to the death than starve to death" and "We'll seize it if you don't lend it." On the 10th, eight grain seizure incidents occurred in Guanyun alone, and the grain hoarded by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the salt fields was looted clean. On the 12th, famine riots occurred simultaneously in Haizhou and Lianyungang. More than 130 disaster victims in Lianyungang seized grain from the home of Wu Tongsong, a landlord and local bully, at the rear guard post of the 449th Regiment of the bandit 44th Division. On the 17th, more than 300 starving people in Xinpu South Street also seized miscellaneous grains carried in trucks by unscrupulous merchants. The grain seizure struggle in the suburban villages was even more intense. Disaster victims used stones, sticks, and iron shovels to smash open the warehouses of landlords and local bullies, looting all the grain. Grain hidden in cellars and haystacks was also dug out and distributed. After the warehouse of Yin Zitong, a large landlord in Haizhou, was looted, twenty nearby landlords were forced to send out grain under the threat of the disaster victims' actions. On the 20th, when 1,000 starving people in Lianyungang flocked to the grain depot of the bandit Huaibei Salt Management Bureau, Chiang Kai-shek bandit police stations, tax offices, and train stations simultaneously fired machine guns at the starving people. The starving people shouted angrily, "Rather be shot to death than starved to death," and swarmed forward. Although many were killed or injured, the starving people still braved the rain of bullets and seized 25 shi of miscellaneous grains. At the same time, more than 500 starving people in Xinpu also clashed with the bandit police. The struggle is still continuing.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Shanghai newspapers report: The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Anhui are levying extremely heavy taxes on merchants, with direct taxes generally increasing, some by as much as twelve times. Bengbu alone bears more than 14 billion yuan in expenses for the Chiang Kai-shek provincial security team. In the areas of Xiuning, Tunxi, and Yixian, a heavy "Yellow Tobacco Pacification Donation" is also being collected. Merchants, unable to bear the oppression, have risen up in opposition. The Anhui Provincial Federation of Commerce sent representatives to Nanjing on March 13 to demand that the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of Finance reduce taxes and miscellaneous levies. All tobacco merchants and vendors in Tunxi, regardless of the threats from the Chiang Kai-shek police局, went on strike on March 15 to protest the donation.

　　苏北蒋区天灾蒋祸惨重
  　饥民奋勇抢粮自救
    灌云蒋匪囤粮被抢一光
    【新华社华东十九日电】据各方报导，陇海铁路东段之新浦、海州、连云港、灌云等蒋占城乡近百里地区，饥民普遍掀起反饥饿夺粮的斗争。该地蒋祸天灾严重，连云港盐业亦一蹶不振，十余万盐民谋生无路，但蒋匪仍向灾民残忍勒索，在海州城门外增设捐卡，凡进城卖草渡命的灾民，均要捐一万五千元路费。灌云司孝堂家卖了两个小孩得到蒋币四十九万元，仅换到十五斤玉米，还不够缴纳蒋匪“军费”。在蒋匪勒索下，人民饿死者极众，仅灌云城郊一个乡已饿死五百人，早在二月间灌云等地饥民即奋起组织：“夺粮团”，三、五十人为一队到地主恶霸家借粮，但蒋匪江苏省第八区专员纪毓智竟下令“抢粮者格杀勿论”。至三月中旬灾民抢粮运动更高涨，灾民喊出：“饿死不如拼死”、“不借就抢”等口号。十日灌云一地就发生八次抢粮事件，蒋匪囤积在盐场的粮食被抢一空。十二日海州及灌云连云市同时发生饥民骚动，连云市一百卅余灾民，在匪四四师四四九团后方留守处驻地，抢去地主恶霸武同松家粮食。十七日新浦南街三百余饥民也抢走奸商汽车所载之杂粮。城郊乡村抢粮斗争更为激烈，灾民多用石头棍棒铁锹砸开地主恶霸仓房，将粮抢光。藏在地窖和草堆里的粮，亦被挖出分光。海州大地主殷子通仓房被抢后，在灾民的行动威震之下，附近就有二十家地主被迫送出粮食。二十日连云市一千饥民涌向匪淮北盐管局粮食大堆栈时，蒋匪警察局、税务所、火车站三处机枪同时向饥民猛射，饥民们愤怒高呼：“宁给打死不给饿死”，顿时蜂拥往前，虽有多人死伤，但饥民们仍冒弹雨抢得杂粮二十五石，同时新浦五百余饥民也和匪警察发生冲突。现斗争仍继续中。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】沪报讯：蒋匪在安徽对商民勒索极为苛重，直接税普遍增加税额，竟有增达十二倍之多者。蚌埠仅负担蒋匪省保安团队经费一项即达一百四十余亿元。休宁、屯溪、黟县一带，并征收苛重的“黄烟绥靖捐”。商民不堪压榨，纷起反对，皖省商联会已于三月十三日推代表赴南京向匪财政部要求减低税收及苛杂。屯溪所有烟商摊贩，则不顾蒋匪警局之恫吓，于三月十五日全体罢市抗捐。
