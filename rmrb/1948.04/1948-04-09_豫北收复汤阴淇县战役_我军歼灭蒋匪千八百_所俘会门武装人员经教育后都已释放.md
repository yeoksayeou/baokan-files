News from the Yubei Front: The total results of the Tangyin campaign are as follows: (1) Our Taihang and Jinnan troops launched an offensive in the vast area east of Tangyin, south of Anyang, and north of Tunziji on the night of the 24th of last month. In five days, up to the 29th, they killed and wounded a total of 428 Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and captured more than 1,300 Chiang Kai-shek bandits below the rank of company commander. Most of those captured were armed members of secret societies, who have been mostly explained to and sent home after education. (2) Recaptured the two county towns of Tangyin and Qixian, and many large and small strongholds such as Guxian (previously misreported as Gudian), Tunziji, and Caiyuan (previously misreported as Taiyuan). Liberated a population of 200,000 and more than 1.2 million *fangli* of land. It is reported that Qixian was occupied by the local tyrant Wang Sanzhu's troops of more than 2,000 men on the 20th of last month. On the night of the 24th, when we conquered Tangyin City, the bandit troops fled in panic to Jixian and Xinxiang. (3) Seized an ordnance repair shop, three small cannons, 13 light machine guns, five submachine guns, 565 rifles and pistols, more than 17,000 rounds of ammunition, and some Chiang Kai-shek currency and grain.
