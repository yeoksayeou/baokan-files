　　Impermissible Errors
    Due to our carelessness in the editing process and lack of a serious and responsible attitude towards the Party newspaper, two news items on the front page of yesterday's (22nd) newspaper contained inappropriate errors: (1) The last item, regarding the Jinnan Sixth Special District assisting with 80 mu of farmland, incorrectly stated "Jinnan" when it should have been "Ji-Lu-Yu." The editor carelessly added a "Jinnan" headline, which was a mistake, and the text should have included "Sixth Special District." Also, in the Wu'an news item, "Taihang" should have been added before "Sixth Special District." (2) In the Sanwang Village news item, "Ninth District" should have been "Wu'an Ninth District." The occurrence of these errors is a concrete manifestation of impure Party spirit. We will pay more attention and strive to correct them in future editing work. (Editor)

　　不容许的错误
    由于我们在编辑过程中的粗枝大叶与缺乏对党报严肃负责态度，二十二日本报一版，有两条消息发生了不应有的错误：（一）末条冀南六专署助耕八十亩消息，冀南应为冀鲁豫，编辑时马虎加了一个冀南消息帽头，是错误的，且文中应有六专署字样也没加上。又，武安消息条，六专署应有太行二字。（二）三王村消息，九区应为武安九区。所以造成以上这些错误，是党性不纯的具体表现，决在今后编辑工作中倍加注意，努力改正。（编者）
