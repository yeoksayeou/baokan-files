　　The "Three Great Combinations" Are Extremely Harmful; People Are Forced to Do What They Don't Want;
  　Formalism Must Be Broken
    [Our Newspaper] News: Recently, in the rectification of mutual aid groups in Pingshun, Licheng and other places, leading cadres have paid attention to and listened to the reflections and demands of the masses, and have begun to break the formalism and coercive practices in the past, and truly resume voluntary mutual aid. In Hongtigan Village, Sixth District of Pingshun, during the democratic party rectification and production, the masses reflected that the "three great combinations" (agriculture, sideline occupations, and war support) last year were organized by cadres' orders. The masses were fundamentally unwilling, but were afraid of being scolded by cadres, and dared not not combine. Many people suffered losses and dared not say anything. For example, the stonemason Zhang Shuanze, repairing the Merit Pavilion was also within the "combination". He used 81 workdays, saying that each workday was worth four catties of rice, and he should have received more than 300 catties of rice in wages. Because it was included in the "three great combinations", he didn't get a single grain himself, and suffered all winter. During the New Year, he lacked salt and firewood, and had to borrow money to survive. Poor peasant Lei Linze earned 180 work points from transportation, but couldn't afford a catty of salt by December. Li Laibao's wife got five catties of cotton, and only got a丈 of cloth... The masses generally reflected that: "The three great combinations are three great life-threatening things (cannot afford to lose money, cannot exchange labor, there are many difficulties due to lack of food and fuel)." After discussion, it was resolutely decided to break the three great combinations and change to free and voluntary combinations. When the masses in Xixiazhuang Village, Licheng, checked how much benefit the "three great combinations" brought them last year, some middle peasants said: "The three great combinations don't know how much labor they wasted; it's really scary. We don't dare to raise any opinions, because if you say anything, people (referring to cadres) will say you have a problem and want to sabotage the three great combinations." Poor peasant Wan Fuyuan said: "Last year, when we were engaged in the three great combinations, we used 30 catties of oil just for lighting lamps, and 45 sheets of hemp paper, not counting the labor point paper." Poor peasant Wang Erhai said: "Last year, the three great combinations asked me to be the textile custodian. I couldn't handle it. The cadre asked me what I was thinking? After I became the custodian, I couldn't do my own production. I was busy collecting thread and distributing cotton every day. Just this cost more than 100 workdays, and as a result, we lost money. Two workdays equaled one workday. Some families who have cotton can also exchange it for cloth, but this combination probably won't be able to exchange it by season. The textile hero Jia Gaijing didn't want to engage in the three great combinations, and even had to be criticized at mass meetings, scaring the masses so that no one dared to disagree. Whoever didn't want to would have their ideology investigated and be labeled as a special agent." Carpenter Qin Yutu said: "Last year, wages were very high outside. I wanted to earn some more money outside, but the cadre said, 'No, you're in the three great combinations. You can't go out if you have someone at home who can use you?' The three great combinations can't combine to earn big wages outside. We really can't afford to combine." Ironworker Liu He said: "In other villages, 打个@ is more than 1,000 yuan, but at home we get three catties of rice a day. It's really not enough to eat." Each group couldn't finish talking about the harms of the "three great combinations". After discussion, it was unanimously proposed to resolutely overthrow them, reorganize mutual aid, and truly make it voluntary, fair, and reasonable, so that no one would suffer losses. It was also decided that the muddled accounts of the "three great combinations" should be cleared up without hindering production.

　　三大结合害人不浅不愿意也得干
  　形式主义必须打破
    【本报消息】最近平顺、黎城等地整顿互助中，领导干部注意与听取了群众的反映和要求，开始打破了过去工作中的形式主义和强制作法，真正重新自愿互助。平顺六区虹梯关村，在民主整党与生产中，群众反映去年的三大结合（农业、副业、战勤），是干部命令组成的，群众根本不愿意，又怕受干部训骂，又不敢不结合，不少人吃了亏也不敢吭。如石匠张拴则，修立功亭也是在“结合”之内，用了八十一天工，说的每工四斤米，应得工资米三百多斤，因归了三大结合，自己连一粒也没得到手，整受一冬，过年时没盐少柴，还得借钱顾嘴。贫农雷林则，运输赚工票一百八十分，到腊月吃不上一斤盐。李来保妻入棉花五斤，只穿上了一丈布……。群众普遍反映说：三大结合是三大要命（赔不起钱，变不起工，没吃缺烧困难多）。经讨论坚决打破三大结合改为自由自愿结合。黎城西下庄群众在检查去年三大结合给咱谋了多少利益时，中农中有人说：“三大结合不知误了多少工；实在弄怕啦，有意见也不敢提，一说人家（指干部）就说你有问题，想破坏三大结合哩”。贫雇万伏元说：“去年搞三大结合，光点灯用了卅来斤油，麻纸用了四十五张，还不算工票纸。”贫农王二孩说：“去年三大结合叫咱当纺织保管，咱弄不了，干部问咱啥思想？当上后自己生产不能干，每天收线发花，真忙死人啦。光这用工一百多个，结果弄赔啦，二工顶一工。有些家里有花也能换布，这一结合恐怕季也换不了。纺织英雄贾改景，不愿搞三大结合，还要在群众会上斗争，吓的群众谁也不敢不同意，谁不愿就要找根追思想戴特务帽。”木工秦玉秃说：“去年外边工资很大，想去外边多赚几个钱，干部就说：“不行，三结合哩，家里有人用你还能出外？”三大结合结的不能出外赚个大工钱，咱实在结不起。”铁工六合说：“外村打个＠一千多元，咱在家当当一天三斤米，实在吃也不够。”各组对三大结合的害处，说也说不完，讨论后一致提出坚决推翻，从新整顿互助，要真正自愿，公道合理，谁也不吃亏。又决定关于三大结合的糊涂帐，在不妨碍生产条件下进行清理。
