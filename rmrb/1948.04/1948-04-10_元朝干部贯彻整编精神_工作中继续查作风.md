　　Yuan Dynasty Cadres Implement Rectification Spirit
  　Continue to Investigate Work Style in Work
    [Yuan Dynasty News] After participating in land reform studies, cadres returned to their posts, determined to immerse themselves among poor and hired peasants and pay attention to implementing the spirit of Party rectification in their work. At the district committee meeting, they conducted self-criticism regarding their standpoint, work style, and ideology. Reflections revealed that many comrades' work styles had improved, they relied on poor and hired peasants, united with middle peasants, and paid attention to following the mass line. However, many problems still existed. Comrade ×× reflected: I spoke with a poor peasant for a long time, and he was very close to me, asking me to stay at his house. I stayed on the kang in his small room, there was a lot of pigeon dung, the pigeon coop was right in the room, a tattered quilt, and a lot of lice. I felt he was dirty. Later, I went to another place, which was clean, and stayed there. Getting close to poor and hired peasants is easier said than done. Another comrade reflected: I didn't follow the mass line for loans. I didn't ask the masses to discuss it. I personally visited the poorest people and directly gave them loans. At that time, I thought I was right. When I heard that others were doing a good job following the mass line and criticized me for having a condescending attitude, I didn't understand at the time. Now I accept this opinion. Another comrade reflected: I clearly saw that poor peasants couldn't plow the land because they didn't have livestock, but I didn't care, I wasn't willing to lead the masses to come up with solutions. My mass perspective is still insufficient, I didn't treat the affairs of poor and hired peasants as my own. After this self-criticism, all the cadres dispelled the complacent idea that they had become better after Party rectification. They all realized that landlord and rich peasant ideology and bureaucratic work styles still existed and believed that the warning bell must be rung frequently. (Guo Yangzhi)

　　元朝干部贯彻整编精神
  　工作中继续查作风
    【元朝消息】干部参加土改学习后，回到工作岗位，都决心深入贫雇，在工作中注意贯彻整党的精神。在区委会开会时，进行查立场查作风查思想，反省中看到不少同志作风都有改造，工作中依靠贫雇团结中农，注意走群众路线。但也还有不少毛病。××同志反省：我和一个贫农说了一晌话，他很亲近我，叫我住在他家，我住到他一间小屋炕上，好多鸽子粪，鸽子架就在屋里，一个破被子，还有好多虱子，我心里嫌他脏，后来到了另外一个地方，怪干净，就住下了。接近贫雇好说不好办。另一个同志反省：贷款我没走群众路线，没叫群众讨论，我自己访苦找最穷的直接贷下去了，那时还认为自己是正确的，听到别人走的群众路线很好，批评我是恩赐观点，当时想不通，现在我接受这意见。又有同志反省：明明见到贫农没法犁地没牲口，我也不管，不愿领导群众生办法，还是群众观念不够，没把贫雇的事当作自己的事。全体干部经过这一查，打消了以为整党后自己变好的自满思想，都认识到地主、富农思想和官僚主义作风仍然存在，认为警钟得时常敲。（郭养之）
