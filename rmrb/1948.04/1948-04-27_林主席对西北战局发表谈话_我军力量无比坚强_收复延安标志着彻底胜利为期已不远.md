Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, April 25th: Chairman Lin Boqu of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government issued a statement on the recapture of Yan'an, stating: The development of historical events proves that the Chinese people are bound to win, and the recovery of the democratic holy land of Yan'an marks that this complete and thorough victory is not far away. From March 19th of last year, when the Chiang-Hu bandit troops invaded and occupied Yan'an, to April 21st of this year, when the Northwest People's Liberation Army recovered Yan'an, in the short period of thirteen months and three days, the Northwest battlefield, like all other brother battlefields across the country, showed that the enemy is weakening day by day while we are growing stronger day by day. In the beginning, the enemy was on the offensive, temporarily occupying the majority of the 37 county towns in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region by relying on their overwhelming numerical superiority. However, after the heroic battles of the great Northwest people and the Northwest People's Liberation Army and local armed forces of the Border Region, the enemy has been greatly weakened—more than 100,000 have been eliminated, and they have been forced to switch from offense to defense and panicked flight. The Northwest People's Liberation Army, after more than a year of training and development, has greatly improved in terms of quantity, equipment, and military and political qualities. Since entering the Chiang-controlled areas to fight, they first achieved a great victory in the Yichuan area, eliminating 30,000 of Hu Zongnan's elite troops in one fell swoop, liberating the vast area of Huanglong Mountain. Then, they advanced into the Jing River and Wei River basin, eliminating more than 5,000 enemies in a few days, and controlling more than 300 li of the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, the enemy's transportation artery. Now, not only have almost all of the original county towns in the Border Region been recovered (only Qingyang, Heshui, Dingbian, and Yanchi are still in enemy hands), but also two commissioner's offices have been newly established, including fifteen county towns in Huanglong and Xifu (between the Jing and Wei Rivers). At the same time, the local armed forces are also becoming increasingly strong, and they have advanced into southern Suiyuan and Ningxia to fight. Chairman Lin believes that the recapture of Yan'an this time is the direct result of the unprecedentedly powerful Northwest military and civilians, and the Yichuan Campaign and the Jing-Wei operations. Chairman Lin praised the unparalleled heroism and great self-sacrificing spirit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, local corps, and all the people, and expressed his respect for the outstanding command of Comrade Peng Dehuai, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army. He said: "We have never made mistakes in military affairs, and we have constantly created and expanded the enemy's mistakes. This is the guarantee for our victory." He particularly emphasized that the loyal support of the people of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui is the real foundation for the victory of the Liberation Army. Chairman Lin mentioned that the dark cloud when the enemy occupied Yan'an in March last year did not submerge the great spirit of the Communists. We firmly led the people, overcame difficulties, defeated the enemy, and overcame the disaster, and finally created the bright development situation of liberating the Great Northwest today. However, he also reminded everyone that the Communists are never complacent with existing achievements. There are still many shortcomings in our ideology and work style, and we still need to open up and consolidate the vast new areas. Liberating the entire Great Northwest still requires arduous struggles, and the continued victorious operations of the powerful Northwest People's Liberation Army still require us to provide more powerful support. Therefore, we should not have any pride or any complacency. The recovery of Yan'an only makes our responsibilities even greater. We must establish a good style of in-depth, practical, and specific leadership, do a good job in production in the old areas, greatly increase material wealth, and enthusiastically go to the glorious work positions in the new areas. In his speech, Chairman Lin especially called on the people's democrats, intellectuals, and industrialists and businessmen in Da Guan Zhong and throughout the Northwest to bravely rise up and form a solid united front with the Communists, jointly eliminate the Chiang-Hu bandit gang, and have a future for development under the program of New Democracy. Chairman Lin pointed out that the victory in Yan'an fully demonstrates that the strength of the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army is unmatched, and no amount of assistance from American imperialism can save Chiang Kai-shek from his inevitable demise. And Chiang Kai-shek's repeatedly touted paper "victory" of occupying Yan'an suddenly disappeared amidst the noise of the pseudo-National Assembly farce. Chairman Lin believes that the continued victories of the Northwest People's Liberation Army in the future, in coordination with the victories of the whole country, will surely send Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule to the grave more quickly. Chairman Lin finally said excitedly: When we evacuated Yan'an last year, we firmly believed that we would definitely come back, and now we have indeed returned.

    林主席对西北战局发表谈话
    我军力量无比坚强
    收复延安标志着彻底胜利为期已不远
    【新华社西北二十五日电】陕甘宁边区政府主席林伯渠就收复延安发表谈话称：历史事变的发展证明中国人民必然胜利，民主圣地延安的收复，标志着这个全部的彻底的胜利已不很远了。从去年三月十九日蒋胡匪军侵占延安，到今年四月二十一日西北人民解放军收复延安的短短十三个月零三天中，西北战场和全国其他各兄弟战场一样，表现着敌人日益衰弱我方日益强大，开始时敌人是进攻的，拚其数量上的绝大优势，暂时侵占了陕甘宁边区三十七个县城的绝大部分，然而经过了伟大的西北人民和西北人民解放军及边区地方武装的英勇战斗，敌人是被大大的削弱了——已被消灭十多万人，并由进攻被迫转入防御和惊慌逃跑，西北人民解放军经过了一年多的锻炼和发展，在数量装备和军事政治素养上都大大增强了。自进入蒋管区作战以来，首在宜川地区大捷，一举消灭胡宗南精锐部队三万人，解放了黄龙山广大地区，继即挺进泾渭流域，数天中就消灭敌人五千多，控制了敌人交通动脉西兰公路三百余里，现在不仅边区原有县城几乎全部收复了（只有庆阳、合水、定边、盐池尚在敌手），并且新建立了包括十五座县城的黄龙与西府（即泾渭两河之间）两个专员公署，同时地方武装也日益坚强了，它已挺进绥远南部和宁夏作战。林主席认为这次延安的收复，就是西北军民力量空前强大，与宜川战役和泾渭作战的直接结果。林主席盛赞西北人民解放军地方兵团和全体人民的无比英勇，与伟大自我牺牲精神，并对人民解放军副总司令彭德怀同志的卓越指挥表示敬意，他说：“我们在军事上从来未犯过错误，而且不断地制造和扩大敌人的错误，这就是我们获得胜利的保证。”他特别强调陕甘宁、晋绥人民的忠诚支援是解放军胜利的真实基础。林主席提到当去年三月敌人占领延安时的那一股乌云，也没有淹没共产党人的伟大气概，我们是坚定地领导着人民，克服困难，战胜敌人，渡过灾荒，终于创造了今天解放大西北的光明的发展的局面。但是他同时提醒大家，共产党人是从不自满于既有的成就的，在我们的工作中尚存在着思想作风上的许多缺点，广大新区还要我们去开辟和巩固，解放整个大西北还需要经过艰巨的斗争，强大的西北人民解放军的继续胜利作战，还需要我们作更有力的支援，所以我们不应该有丝毫骄傲和任何安逸的思想，延安的收复，只是我们的责任更加重大了，我们要建立深入实际具体领导的良好作风，在老区做好生产工作，大量增加物资财富，并且踊跃地到新区光荣的工作岗位上去。林主席在发言中特别号召大关中和全西北的人民民主人士、知识分子、工商业家，都勇敢地起来和共产党人结成坚固的统一战线，一致消灭蒋胡匪帮，在新民主主义的纲领下都有发展前途。林主席指出延安的胜利充分说明中国人民和人民解放军的力量是无比的，美帝国主义的任何援助都挽救不了蒋介石必然灭亡的命运，而蒋介石一再吹嘘的占领延安的纸上“胜利”，在伪国大丑剧喧闹声中突然地消失了。林主席相信今后西北人民解放军的继续胜利，配合全国的胜利，一定会更快地把蒋介石的反动统治最后送到坟墓里去。林主席最后兴奋地说：当去年我们撤离延安时，我们坚信一定还要回来的，现在我们果然回来了。
