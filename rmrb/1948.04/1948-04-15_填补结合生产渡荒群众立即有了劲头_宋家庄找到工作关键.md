　　[Pingding News] In Songjiazhuang, Fifth District of Pingding, the masses were not very enthusiastic about carrying out democratic land redistribution and were alienated from the work team, making it difficult to make headway. The work team examined the reasons and found that the village had deviated from the correct policies in the past, and the masses were still skeptical about this democratic land redistribution. In addition, the famine was severe, and most of the masses were busy with sideline production to overcome the famine, fearing that meetings would waste time. Although the masses were very eager for democracy, they feared retaliation from the cadres, and the old organization did not want to reflect on its mistakes but collapsed. The work team analyzed the situation and immediately changed its approach, determining the principle of combining democratic land redistribution with production, first organizing the masses to produce and helping them find a way out. First, various meetings were held to stabilize the panic caused by the lack of food and to connect with the masses on specific issues. In solving the spring famine for the masses, after discussion, it was decided to help those with labor but no capital with loans, and they would strive to produce and save themselves. For households without labor, everyone decided to extract a portion of the existing fruit and grain to provide relief. After this solution, the production enthusiasm of the masses was improved, and more than 80 people were organized to transport iron, earning 14 *shi* of millet in one trip, and a second group went (and have not yet returned). The masses' production and demands for democracy were thus stimulated, and they approached the work team and reflected a lot of information about the whole village. The comrades of the work team also became interested in their work. The specific approach was to hand over the disaster relief work to the Poor Peasants' League for discussion, using the method of borrowing from the fruit to solve the current food difficulties of 36 households in the village. Households with labor freely contribute shares to engage in production, and the prestige of the Poor Peasants' League began to be established. The Poor Peasants' League also developed to 244 people, accounting for 15% of the total population. After solving specific problems, they took a step forward in ideological awareness. At this time, the formal committee members of the Poor Peasants' League were elected. At present, the work in the village has turned to classifying class status, uniting the middle peasants, and preparing to establish a new Peasants' Association.

　　填补结合生产渡荒群众立即有了劲头 　 宋家庄找到工作关键
    【平定消息】平定五区宋家庄，进行民主填补，群众劲头不高，对工作组也很疏远，工作打不开局面。工作组检查原因，主要是该村过去执行政策有偏差，群众对这次民主填补仍有怀疑，加之灾荒严重，多数群众又忙于搞副业渡荒，怕开会误时间，群众对民主要求虽十分迫切，但怕干部报复，老组织没有受到群众压力，不愿反省反而躺倒。工作组分析了这个情况，即时变了作法，确定民主填补与生产结合的方针，首先组织群众生产，帮助群众找活路。先召开各种不同会议，安定没吃恐慌情绪，从具体问题上连系群众。在解决群众春荒上，经群众讨论，有劳力无资本的人在贷款上帮助一部，自己努力生产自救。无劳力的户大家决定将现有的果实粮抽出一部救济。这样解决以后，群众的生产情绪提高，组织了八十余人送铁，一次收入小米十四石，二次又走了（现尚未回来）。群众的生产与民主要求从此激发，对工作组也靠近，反映了不少全村情况；工作组同志在工作上也感了兴趣。具体作法是把救灾工作交与贫农团讨论，从果实中用借的办法解决全村卅六户刻下无吃困难，有劳力户自由抽股搞生产，贫农团的威信开始树立。贫农团也发展到二百四十四人，占总人口百分之十五。经过解决具体问题，在思想觉悟上提高了一步。这时选举了贫农团正式委员。现该村工作转向划成份、团结中农、准备成立新农会。
