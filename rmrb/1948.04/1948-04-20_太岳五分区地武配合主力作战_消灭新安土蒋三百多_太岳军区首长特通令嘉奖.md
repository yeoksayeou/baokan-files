    [Taiyue News] The local armed forces of the Taiyue Fifth Military Sub-district (south of the Yellow River, north of the Hai River) coordinated with the People's Liberation Army in the second recovery of Luoyang, achieving a very good annihilation battle. On the 6th of this month, Guo Zhi, the puppet county magistrate of Xin'an County, led more than 300 local Chiang troops (Chiang Kai-shek, due to a lack of troops, also organized these 300 people into a "brigade," with Guo Zhi as the "brigade commander") to harass the Nanguo Village area of Xin'an, and were surrounded by our local armed forces. The "Deputy Brigade Commander" Guan Jiwu, "Regimental Commander" Guo Wenzong, Wei Qinglong, and 337 others were all wiped out. The leaders of the Taiyue Military Region issued a special commendation, and pointed out that this battle was a good coordination with the regular army's second recovery of Luoyang. From the beginning of March to this battle, the Fifth Military Sub-district's local armed forces annihilated a total of 847 local Chiang troops, of which 749 were captured alive. They seized 2 mortars, 1 heavy machine gun, 12 light machine guns, 476 rifles, 31 pistols, and many other military supplies.
    [Our Newspaper's News] The local armed forces of the Taihang Second and Fourth Military Sub-districts took the initiative to attack Yan Xishan's puppet troops, and fought two more beautiful battles. On the 13th, more than 130 men from the enemy's independent regiment in Shouyang went from Yanjia Village to Qili River to loot grain. They were hurriedly preparing food to fill their starving stomachs when they were suddenly surrounded by the local armed forces of our Second Military Sub-district. As a result of the battle, we killed and wounded 56 enemy soldiers, seized 47 rifles, 3 small cannons, 118 hand grenades, 29 small cannon shells, and more than 500 bullets. On the 11th, the local armed forces of Xiuwu, combined with militia and a part of the Fourth Military Sub-district's armed forces, ambushed 12 members of the puppet Baoan Fourth Battalion stationed in Daiwang, Xiuwu, who were out looting grain on the Jiaozuo-Daiwang Highway at Wenlihe Village, and annihilated them all, killing and wounding 5, capturing 7, and seizing 8 rifles, 1 light machine gun, and more than 1,000 bullets. Both of these battles resolutely and proactively dealt a powerful blow to the enemy. Our side suffered no casualties and achieved a glorious victory. The military region issued a special commendation to the entire region.
    [Another Dispatch] After completing reorganization and training last month, the Yingbing Battalion of Qi County immediately went to the Zhongliang and Tuanbai areas to proactively attack Yan Xishan's bandits who were looting grain. Our Yingbing Battalion ambushed in the strategic location of Yuanling, intercepting more than 300 men from a unit of Yan Xishan's 37th Division and more than 10 men from the Wangqiao puppet Self-Defense Force. After our heroic charge, they captured 12 Yan bandit Self-Defense Force leaders and others alive, killed and wounded 2, and seized 1 machine gun, 1 small cannon, 7 rifles, 24 hand grenades, and more than 400 bullets. The remaining enemies fled in panic. The border region militia of the Taihang Second Military Sub-district also continued to fight bravely and achieved victories. On April 3rd, a unit of Yan Xishan's Ninth Column direct unit attempted to loot grain in Beiquhe and entered the positions set up by the militia of the Fifth District of Taigu. Our firepower was unleashed, and the enemy fled in disarray. This battle killed and wounded another 15 enemy soldiers (including one battalion commander and one company commander each), captured one alive, and seized 1 light machine gun, 1 small cannon, 5 cannon shells, 2 steel helmets, and 27 bullets. The militia of Shanghuangcai and Dubao villages in Yuci coordinated with the Yingbing Battalion to proactively attack, annihilating more than 10 enemies in three battles and seizing 8 rifles.
