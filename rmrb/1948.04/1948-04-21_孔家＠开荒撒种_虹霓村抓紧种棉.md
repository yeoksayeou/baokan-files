　　Kongjia @ Clearing Wasteland and Sowing Seeds, Hongni Village Seizes Time to Plant Cotton
　　[Licheng News] In Kongjia @ Village, Fifth District of Licheng, the production enthusiasm of cadres and the masses was very low because democratic land redistribution was not carried out. After studying the Border Region Government's proclamation "Whoever plants it, harvests it," the cadres recognized the importance of production and resolved to lead production well. A meeting of all cadres and mutual aid team leaders was convened to specifically discuss production. First, they explained to everyone that our village is not yet carrying out land redistribution, and we should not wait for it; we should focus on production. After discussions and deliberations in various mutual aid teams, the masses actively engaged in production with great enthusiasm. Now, all the fertilizer has been delivered to the fields. Especially this year, with abundant spring rains, under the influence of Fu Fukou and He Kucheng, everyone organized and, in the past ten days or so, reclaimed a total of more than 160 mu of wasteland. In particular, the three mutual aid teams of Zhao Jitang, Kong Shuqin, and Kong Huren, with 23 laborers, reclaimed more than 60 mu, accounting for 40% of the entire village (they sowed the seeds while reclaiming the wasteland because the soil was good). They are still reclaiming, and everyone's production enthusiasm is very high.
　　Also: Due to last year's poor harvest, most middle and poor peasants are facing difficulties in obtaining hemp seeds this spring. The cooperative heard the masses' feedback and, in addition to the hemp seeds exchanged at the cooperative's oil mill, also purchased some to lend to middle and poor peasants for seeds, solving their seed shortage. Now, with abundant spring rains and good soil, they are making a concentrated effort to sow seeds. (Yongkui, Caiting, Xiyao Tan, Kong Dexuan)
　　[Pingshun News] Hongni Village, Sixth District of Pingshun, has thin soil and a dense population with little land. The masses mostly rely on laboriously cutting firewood from the mountains to make a living. Due to last year's drought, they are facing famine. Landless and land-poor peasants actively demanded land redistribution. After the work team arrived in the village, they carried out land redistribution on the one hand and organized production on the other. The peasants raised opinions to some bad cadres, asking them to correct themselves, and on the other hand, requested better cadres (such as political director Song Tianfu and village head Liu Linnian) to lead production. After receiving the Outline Land Law, these two cadres have been working hard to focus on production work. On the fifth day of the first lunar month, they formulated a production plan for sending fertilizer and cutting firewood. On the first day of the second lunar month, they led the entire village in planting production trees. On the tenth day of the second lunar month (lunar calendar), they organized the masses to actively plant cotton, sowing 122.8 mu of cotton in five days. Each team regularly checks the production plan, and they are very enthusiastic about spring plowing and overcoming the famine. (Kemin, Shuangcheng, Jiqiu)

　　孔家＠开荒撒种　虹霓村抓紧种棉
    【黎城消息】黎城五区孔家＠村，不进行民主填补，但干部群众的生产情绪非常低落，经过学习边府谁种谁收布告，干部认识了生产的重要，决心好好领导生产。召开全体干部及互助组长会议，专门讨论生产。先给大家说明咱村现在还不进行填补，不应等着，还是好好生产。经过各个互助组酝酿讨论，群众都积极生产起来，劲头很大，现在把肥已全部送到地里。特别是今年春雨多，在傅福口、何苦成的影响下，大家都组织起来，统计在近十来天，共开荒一百六十多亩。特别是赵计堂、孔书琴、孔虎仁三个互助组，廿三个劳力，就开了六十来亩，占全村百分之四十（在开荒时随即将种撒下因垧土好），现还在开着，大家的生产劲头很高。
    又息：因去年歉收，一般中贫农今春没有大小麻，种籽很感困难。合作社听到群众反映，除合作社油坊换上的大小麻籽外，又收买了一部，都借给中、贫农作种籽，解决他们的种籽困难。现在春雨多，地有垧正在突击下种。（勇魁、彩廷、希尧谈、孔德轩）
    【平顺消息】平顺六区虹霓村，石厚土薄人稠地窄，群众多靠劳动砍山过活，由于去年遭了旱灾，面前就临着灾荒，无地少地农民积极要求抽补，工作组一到村后，一方面进行抽补，一方面组织生产。农民向坏的一些干部提了意见，让他改正，又一方面要求较好的干部（如政治主任宋天伏、村长刘林年）领导生产。这两个干部，接到土地法大纲以后，对生产工作一直就努力抓的紧，在正月初五就订生产计划送肥、打柴，二月初一又领导全村栽生产树，在二月初十日（阴）又组织群众积极种棉花，五天下种棉花一百二十二亩八。各队都按期检查生产计划，春耕渡荒很有劲。（克敏、双成、季秋）
