(This report from our newspaper's correspondent in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, dated the 23rd) As the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang faces military defeat, they are deliberately destroying Yellow River dams to inundate the people. Since the beginning of spring this year, this despicable and shameless act has intensified. After three instances of sabotage of the Jiangsu Dam project and the burning of a large amount of our straw material, on April 15th, while our workers were rushing to reinforce the dam, bandits from the 55th Division suddenly attacked the Jiangsu Dam workers, causing a sudden dangerous situation at the New Second Dam, threatening a breach. At the Gao Village dangerous section in Dongming County, since February 20th, Chiang's special agents have twice cut twenty iron wire bottom hook ropes on the Seventh Dam. On April 16th, part of Chiang Kai-shek's 68th Division cut another ten iron wire bottom hook ropes of the repaired Seventh Dam and threw them into the river. This dam is under the greatest pressure from the waves and has been repeatedly damaged, constantly losing its support, creating dangerous situations. In order to cover up their ugly deeds and shirk responsibility, Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda agency, the Central News Agency, issued a shameless rumor on March 29th, falsely accusing us of destroying the Zhukou and Liuzhuang Dam revetments. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits not only sabotage dangerous sections in our area, but also disregard the lives and property of the people in the areas they control, failing to carry out any repairs. For example, at Leiji in Lanfeng County, since the peach flood this year, a section of the embankment along the Yellow River has been eroded. The current water is eroding high ground 200 meters wide outside the embankment. If this 200-meter-wide high ground is not repaired, it will be washed away within a few months, inevitably causing a major breach and inundating millions of people in counties such as Juancheng, Caoxian, Shanxian, and Fengpei, creating a second Yellow River flood area. The military and civilians and river management workers in our areas are extremely angry at this act of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The struggle to repair the dams has now become a situation of "Chiang destroys, we repair, repeatedly destroyed, repeatedly repaired." If a breach disaster occurs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits should bear full responsibility.

### 黄河桃汛到来之际　蒋匪不断破坏堤坝

　　黄河桃汛到来之际
  　蒋匪不断破坏堤坝
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】蒋介石匪帮在其军事溃败之际，蓄意破坏黄河大坝淹没人民。自今年春初，这种卑鄙无耻的暴行就变本加厉。在其三次破坏江苏坝工程、烧毁我大批秸料之后，四月十五日我员工正在抢险，匪五五师突然袭击江苏坝员工，致使新二坝突发生险象，有决口之虞。在东明县之高村险工，自二月廿日以来，蒋特即连续两次割坏第七坝铁丝底钩绳二十根。四月十六日，蒋匪六八师一部，又将我修好的第七坝铁丝底钩绳割坏十根丢到河内。此坝为大浪冲击最为吃力，屡遭破坏，不断掉蛰，险象环生，蒋匪为了掩盖丑行，推卸罪责，由其造谣公司中央社于三月二十九日发出诬我破坏朱口、刘庄坝埽的无耻谣言。蒋匪不但破坏我区险工，即在它自己控制的地区，也置人民生命财产于不顾，毫未进行修理。如兰封境之雷集，自今年桃汛后，临黄堤一段已被冲刷，现水势正冲刷临黄堤外二百公尺宽之高地，此二百公尺宽的高地，如再不修理，数月内即将被刷掉，必然造成决口的大祸，淹没我鄄城、曹县、单县、丰沛等县数百万人民，造成第二个黄汛区。我各地军民及治河员工对蒋匪这种暴行极为愤怒。抢修堤坝的斗争，现已成为“蒋破我修，屡破屡修”的形势，如一旦发生决口的灾祸，蒋匪应负全部罪责。
