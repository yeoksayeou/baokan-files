Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Comprehensive report: The anti-hunger and anti-oppression student movement in Peiping and Tientsin, which began at the end of last month, has lasted for more than three weeks. The institutions involved include Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Sino-French University, Peiping Normal College, North China College, Peiping Research Institute, Chaoyang College, Railway College, and the high school department of Huizhong Girls' High School in Peiping, as well as Nankai University, Peiyang University, and Hebei Institute of Technology in Tianjin, totaling fourteen institutions, with approximately 20,000 teachers and students participating.

This student movement erupted on the basis of anti-hunger. Since the beginning of the year, teachers and students in Peiping, Tientsin, and various schools have continuously launched struggles demanding full public funding and improved treatment. However, the Chiang Kai-shek government, on the eve of the opening of its bogus National Assembly, ordered the dissolution of the North China Student Federation on March 26, thereby forcing the academic circles in Peiping and Tientsin to combine the political struggle against fascist oppression with the economic struggle to save lives and seek survival. On the 29th of last month, more than a thousand student representatives from various schools in Peiping held a protest rally at Peking University, declaring the official start of this righteous movement. At the meeting, students from various schools, disregarding the encirclement and intimidation of Chiang Kai-shek's armed military police, fiercely criticized Chiang Kai-shek's puppet "National Assembly" and screened the famous film "Lenin in 1918," reflecting the growing revolutionary sentiment among the masses in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas. Subsequently, students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Normal College, and Sino-French University simultaneously announced a three-day strike starting from April 3 to defend the Student Federation. Nankai University and Hebei Institute of Technology announced a strike starting from April 4, and Peiyang University from April 6. During the strike, various schools held "Defend the Student Federation Accusation Meetings" and issued declarations expressing their determination to defend the Student Federation, calling for support from all sectors of society. Students from Tsinghua University and Yenching University jointly formed more than thirty accusation groups starting from April 2, visiting professors to seek sympathy. Nankai University, while deciding to strike, established the "Nankai Student Union Defend the Student Federation Committee," sending a letter to the school's president, Zhang Boling, requesting him to lodge a serious protest with the Chiang Kai-shek government and appeal to the "World Student Federation." The students' struggle to defend the Student Federation and resist oppression received widespread support from professors, staff, and workers in various schools. Many professors personally participated in the demonstration rally on March 29 and delivered speeches criticizing Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial and civil war policies. A professor at Peking University told foreign reporters that the student movement could not be suppressed, and even if the organization was dissolved, the struggle would continue. After the students in various schools began their anti-oppression strike, more than 2,000 lecturers, teaching assistants, staff, workers, school police, and graduate students from the Peiping Research Institute held a joint three-day strike starting from April 6, demanding the continued distribution of two bags of flour and improved treatment, and using this to support the anti-oppression struggle of students in various schools. All professors at Tsinghua University and professors at the Peking University College of Engineering also went on strike for three days starting from April 6 to express sympathy for lecturers and teaching assistants. Furthermore, all lecturers and teaching assistants at Peiyang University and Nankai University in Tianjin also went on strike for three days starting from April 6, demanding improved treatment. On the morning of the 7th, Li Tingguang, director of the school hospital at Nankai University, committed suicide by drowning due to financial difficulties, further arousing the determination of staff in various schools to save lives and seek survival.

After faculty, graduate students, and police at the five Peiping and Tianjin institutions announced their strike, students from various schools extended their strikes to support each other and continued to demand that the Chiang Kai-shek authorities withdraw their order to dissolve the Student Federation. Tsinghua University and Peking University extended their strikes for three days starting from the 6th, Yenching University for one day, and Nankai University for three days. At the same time, North China College also participated in the anti-oppression strike starting from the 6th. Peiping Art College also went on strike for three days starting from the 6th to protest Chiang Kai-shek's occupation of the school's dormitories. Faculty and staff at Yenching University and the high school department of Huizhong Girls' High School also announced their participation in a one-day strike on the 8th. By this time, the movement had become a united struggle of teachers and students from various schools.

After students from various schools held a joint strike, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in Peiping committed atrocities at Normal College and Peking University. Zhu Zhuying, a female student from Nankai University (formerly mistakenly reported as Zhu Zuying), was injured by Chiang Kai-shek's agents after a gathering on the evening of the 5th. On the 8th, fifty or sixty Chiang Kai-shek special agents broke into North China College, shooting and injuring students Huang Chengxian, Jing Youxin, and others, and arrested Yao Jiong, Zhao Xueqin, and others, looting a great deal of property. Students from various schools in Peiping were extremely indignant about this. On the morning of the 9th, they held a large-scale anti-oppression demonstration of more than 8,000 people, surrounding Chiang Kai-shek's Peiping Pacification Headquarters, raising the blood-stained clothes of injured students, chanting anti-oppression slogans, and singing the magnificent songs calling on the people to rise up and "oppose foreign (referring to the United States) oppression." The demonstration lasted for as long as eleven hours, until late at night, when Chiang Kai-shek was forced to release the eight arrested students and promise to ensure that similar incidents would not occur again, before returning to school victoriously. In addition to the striking schools, students from Chaoyang and Railway Colleges also participated in this demonstration.

After the student demonstration, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his special agent lackeys to come out en masse on the 11th, shouting and clamoring in the streets, heading straight to Peking University, breaking into the campus to assault students, and searching professors' dormitories. The result was to arouse more resolute resistance from teachers and students in various schools. Students from various schools responded to Chiang Kai-shek with a continued strike. All professors at Peking University announced a one-week strike starting from the 12th in protest. All faculty and staff at Yenching University (including all American professors and members of the school board) not only decided to continue their strike in protest but also jointly issued a declaration, pointing out that the atrocities of the special agents made "it difficult for us to carry out normal educational work." Teachers and students in various schools had unanimously felt the necessity of unity and self-defense. Students from Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Normal College, together with faculty and staff, formally established a "Security Committee" on the 15th to resist the violent persecution of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. The close unity and concerted action of students, professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, staff, workers, and school police in various schools not only reflected that the social foundation of the patriotic and democratic movement in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas had been further expanded but also declared the complete bankruptcy of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in politics.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: According to a foreign news agency report on the 19th, Chiang Kai-shek, in awe of the power of the student mass movement, had He Siyuan, the puppet mayor of Peiping, and Chen Jicheng, the garrison commander, offer a written apology to teachers and students of various schools last week for the recent arrests and other atrocities by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. Currently, except for Peking University and Peiping Normal College, where students are still insisting on their anti-oppression strike, the remaining schools have resumed classes.

　　平津救死求生学潮绵延近月
  　参加师生总数达两万
    蒋匪被迫道歉北大仍坚持罢课
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】综合报导：上月底开始的平、津反饥饿，反压迫学潮，迄今已逾三周，先后卷入者，计有北平的北大、清华、燕京、中法大学、北平师院、华北学院、北平研究院、朝阳学院、铁路学院及惠中女中高中部，天津的南开、北洋大学，和河北工学院共十四个院校，参加师生总数约两万。
    这次学潮，是在反饥饿的基础上爆发的。年初以来平、津及各校师生即不断展开要求全面公费提高待遇的斗争，但蒋匪政府反而在其伪国大开幕前夕，于三月二十六日下令解散华北学联，遂进而迫使平津学界把反对法西斯压迫的政治斗争，与救死求生的经济斗争结合起来。上月二十九日北平各校学生代表千余人，在北大举行的抗议集会上，宣告这次正义运动的正式开始。会上，各校学生不顾蒋匪武装军警的包围恫吓，猛烈抨击蒋匪傀儡“国大”，并放映著名的“列宁在一九一八年”影片，反映了革命情绪在蒋区群众中日益高涨。接着，北大、清华、燕京、师院、中法五大学学生同时宣布为保卫学联自四月三日起，南开与河北工院宣布自四日起，北洋则自六日起各罢课三天。各校在罢课期间纷纷举行“保卫学联控诉大会”，并发表宣言表明保卫学联决心，呼吁社会各界的支助。清华、燕京两大学学生且于四月二日起即联合组成三十多个控诉小组，分访教授，吁求同情。南开大学与决定罢课同时成立“南开学生自治会保卫学联委员会”，致函该校校长张伯苓请其向蒋政府提出严重抗议，并向“世界学联呼吁”。各大学学生保卫学联、反抗压迫的斗争，获得各校教授与职员工役的广泛支持。许多教授亲自参加三月二十九日的示威集会，发表抨击蒋介石独裁内战政策的演说，北大某教授对外籍记者表示，学生运动是压不下去的，即令解散组织，斗争仍将继续。在各校学生反压迫罢课开始后，北大、清华两大学讲师、助教、职员、工友、校警和北平研究院研究生共二千余人，即自四月六日起举行联合罢教、罢研、罢工、罢岗三天，要求续配两袋面粉及改善待遇，并以此支援各校学生的反压迫斗争。清华全体教授及北大工学院教授亦自六日起罢教三天，以表示对讲师、助教的同情；而天津北洋、南开两大学全体讲师助教亦为要求改善待遇，自六日起罢课三天。七日晨南开校医主任李廷光因生活逼迫而投河自杀，更激起了各校职员救死求生的决心。
    当平津五院校教职员、研究生与工警宣布罢教罢研罢工之后，各校学生即纷纷延长罢课，以互为支援，并继续要求蒋匪当局收回解散学联成命。清华、北大自六日起延长三天，燕大延长一天，南开延长三天。同时华北学院自六日起亦参加反压迫罢课，北平艺专亦为抗议蒋匪占住该校宿舍，自六日起罢课三天。燕大及惠中女中高中部教职员亦于八日宣布参加罢教一天。至此运动已成为各校师生团结一致的斗争。
    自各校学生举行联合罢课后，北平蒋匪特务即在师院及北大等校行凶，南开女生朱竹英（前误为朱祖英）于五日晚集会后为蒋特欧伤，八日北平蒋特五、六十人复闯入华北学院，枪伤学生黄成先、荆又新等多人，将姚炯、赵学勤等八人捕去，并抢劫财物甚多。平市各校学生对此异常愤慨，九日晨即举行八千余人的反压迫大示威游行，将蒋匪北平行辕团团包围，高举受伤同学血衣，齐呼反压迫口号，高唱号召人民起来“反对外国（指美国）压迫”的雄壮歌曲。示威坚持达十一小时之久，直至深夜，蒋匪被迫释放被捕八学生及应允保证不再发生类似事件后，始胜利返校。此次参加示威者，除罢课各校外，尚包括朝阳及铁路两学院学生。
    在学生大示威之后，蒋匪即命令其特务喽罗于十一日全体出动，在街上叫嚣呐喊，直奔北大，闯入校内欧打学生，并搜查教授宿舍，而其结果是激起了各校师生的更坚决反抗。各校学生以坚持罢课回答蒋匪。北大全体教授则宣布自十二日起罢教一周抗议，燕京全体教职员（包括全体美籍教授及校务委员）除决定继续罢教抗议外，并联名发表宣言，指出由于特务暴行使“我们感到难以进行正常教育工作”。各校师生已一致感觉团结自卫的必要。清华、北大、师院三大学学生已联合教职员于十五日正式组成“安全委员会”，以抵抗蒋匪暴力迫害。各校学生与教授、讲师、助教、职员、工友、校警的紧密团结一致行动，不但反映了蒋区爱国民主运动的社会基础已更加扩大，亦宣告了蒋介石匪帮在政治上的彻底破产。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据外国通讯社十九日报导：蒋匪慑于学生群众运动威力，上周由匪北平市长何思源、警备司令陈继承出面对最近蒋特的逮捕及其他暴行向各校师生提出书面道歉，现除北京大学与北平师院两校学生仍坚持反压迫罢课外，其余学校业已复课。
