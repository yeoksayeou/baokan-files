　　【This Newspaper News】In order to correct left-leaning adventurism, rectify policies, and correctly implement the central line, policies, and guidelines, the Central Bureau makes the following instructions regarding the questions raised by the Taiyue District Party Committee:

　　First, affirm the correctness and achievements of the National Land Conference (the Yetao Conference was to convey and implement the spirit and decisions of the National Land Conference) (all Party rectification in various regions has achieved results after the Yetao Conference). It is entirely correct and necessary to continue implementing anti-leftism in specific policies. Although you have made some progress in correcting left-leaning adventurism in the past three months, the transformation is still very poor and must continue to be corrected. According to your reports, some left-leaning sentiments still remain on certain issues and must be earnestly corrected to avoid making even greater mistakes in your work. The key lies in the fact that the District Party Committee must be very clear when implementing the central policies and formulating specific policies. It must distinguish the boundaries between what is allowed and what is not allowed, and constantly check to ensure that it is properly grasped. If errors are found, they must be corrected immediately.

　　Second, provide specific answers to the questions you have raised as follows:

　　(1) The issue of uniting with the middle peasants. Your infringement of the interests of the middle peasants last winter and the past wrong struggles against the middle peasants were errors of principle and cannot be dismissed lightly with a simple statement of "this is wrong." Regardless of whether there are preserved undistributed fruits, compensation must be given. There can be no wavering on matters of principle. With spring plowing imminent, priority should be given to supplying the middle peasants who have been struggled against with some grain and essential means of production so that they can engage in production with peace of mind. Other losses can be compensated during the replenishment movement later. For those middle peasants whose doors have been sealed, the error must be acknowledged and the seals immediately and unconditionally removed. Those who have been subjected to control and registration of property must have these measures immediately and unconditionally cancelled. Forcing middle peasants to lend money to poor peasants and hired laborers, forcibly extracting shares from middle peasants in cooperatives to give to poor peasants and hired laborers, and forcibly borrowing middle peasants' vehicles and livestock for poor peasants and hired laborers to use for production are all one-sided views of poor peasants and hired laborers. It means running after the backwardness of poor peasants and hired laborers, and it is anarchistic thinking. It should be immediately and unconditionally returned to the original owners in full. Those middle peasants who have been wrongly deprived of their civil rights should have them immediately and unconditionally restored. They have the same right to join farmers' associations, farmers' representative conferences, and mutual aid groups, and may participate in leadership with the democratic consent of everyone.

　　(2) In the past, some landlords who were guilty of heinous crimes and stubbornly resisted land reform were given the punishment of being swept out of their homes, which was originally a temporary measure with educational significance. If it is delayed for too long, it is wrong. Now, landlords and rich peasants who have been swept out of their homes must be immediately given the necessary means of livelihood and production so that they can engage in production, guaranteeing that no one starves to death. If they are allowed to starve to death, or if it is argued that the land and property have already been divided and cannot be resolved, or if it is argued that the masses cannot be persuaded, it is to adhere to left-leaning adventurism, it is anarchistic thinking. In the subsequent replenishment, these landlords and rich peasants who have been swept out of their homes must also be given the same share as the peasants. Your statement that the property of middle peasants who have been swept out of their homes should be unsealed first, and then the property of landlords and rich peasants should be unsealed, in two stages rather than at the same time, is wrong. It is preparing to starve some people to death. Special controls on landlords, such as special armbands, signs, asking for leave to go out, reporting visitors, and other symbols, should all be immediately and unconditionally cancelled and should not be delayed until the middle peasant issue is resolved. You are wrong to cancel part of them separately and retain part of them. If you do this, some people below will use it as an excuse not to actively resolve the serious problem that has already been made in error and that if it is not resolved, people will starve to death. If you do this, it will not be possible to correct this error. Only those landlords and local bullies who are blatantly and stubbornly resistant, and who are known and recognized by all as sabotaging land reform, should be given certain controls, but such controls must be decided by the people's court and announced by the government before they can be implemented. Villages cannot decide on their own. Houses of landlords and rich peasants should be unsealed immediately and unconditionally. You leave a tail, saying that those with hidden property will not be unsealed, which is also wrong. If it is known that they have hidden property, they can be ordered to hand it over according to the Outline Land Law. If they do not hand it over, people can be sent to dig it out with their cooperation. If it cannot be dug out, it cannot be determined that they really have it, it is trumped up, and it should not be sealed for a long time. The use of landlords and rich peasants for unpaid labor should be prohibited immediately. All labor service teams, reformatories, and detention centers in all villages should be dissolved immediately. This is a violation of government decrees and the people's democratic rights. Imposing controls on landlords' and rich peasants' women, such as not allowing them to marry, and requiring them to marry someone from the village, is feudal rule and must be abolished immediately. Freedom of divorce and marriage must be guaranteed. Peasants or cadres who marry the daughters of landlords and rich peasants should also be allowed, and they should not be forced to divorce. In the future, those who wish to marry should be allowed to do so. Landlords and rich peasants generally have labor power and should be organized into mutual aid groups to urge them to produce in order to increase social wealth. Killing landlords and rich peasants is a great error of principle, and rejecting landlords and rich peasants from the production circle is an extremely wrong and extremely stupid approach.

　　(3) All regulations or erroneous customary laws that seriously violate the people's democratic rights should be abolished immediately. The Border Region Government has already promulgated clear orders, and your Administrative Office should also issue orders separately. Cancel the right of village cadres to declare martial law, and immediately and unconditionally remove the "special agent" hats that have been imposed on the people in the past and restore their civil rights. Abolish the road pass system. In the liberated areas, no road passes are required, and passage is unimpeded. Everything should be based on the principle of benefiting the people and facilitating commerce.

　　(4) Abolish corporal punishment and strictly prohibit beating, hanging, dragging, forcing to death, and beating to death. If there is indeed criminal behavior, it must be judged by the people's court and approved by the higher authorities before it can be executed. Those sentenced to death can only be executed by shooting and cannot be executed by any other method. The use of corporal punishment is a feudalistic thing that the Communist Party must oppose and cannot echo.

　　(5) Resolutely protect industry and commerce (including the industry and commerce of landlords and rich peasants in urban and rural areas) and must not infringe upon them. It is not allowed to liquidate or struggle against industry and commerce. Whether before or after the May 4th Directive, if landlords and rich peasants have transferred their property to cooperatives, factories, or stores, they cannot be regarded as transformed landlords (this term itself is wrong. Landlords who transform into industry and commerce are a progressive phenomenon, allowed and welcomed). They should be regarded as industry and commerce, resolutely protected, and not confiscated and distributed. If it has been struggled against but not distributed, or only counted as mass shares (such as so-called changing the god but not the temple), or even if it has been divided but not damaged or consumed, it should be returned to the original owners to continue operating. If the capital is insufficient, the government can provide low-interest or interest-free loans to support it (the past bank regulations stipulating that loans can only be granted to poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants are wrong). If it has been distributed and consumed, the method of chasing and compensating should be determined according to the circumstances. The government can also provide the original owners with low-interest or interest-free loans to enable them to resume business. For runaway merchants, various relationships should be used to strive for their return to the liberated areas to operate. Shops and factories should also be resolutely protected. If there is an agent, the agent should take care of it. If there is no agent, the government should temporarily take care of it and return it to the original owner for operation after they return. If it is indeed the industry and commerce of bureaucratic capital and the most counter-revolutionary elements, the right to confiscate and dispose of it belongs to the Administrative Office and the Border Region Government. Its subordinate governments and any other organs, groups, or individuals have no right to confiscate and dispose of it. After the Border Region Government and the Administrative Office confiscate it, it must not be dispersed and must continue to operate.

　　(6) Enlightened gentry are those among the landlords who support anti-American and anti-Chiang and land reform. These people have a landlord standpoint, but as long as they do not oppose land reform and do not take action, they must be united and not excluded. Friends are strength and must be united. The same policy of unity should be adopted towards intellectuals.

　　Third, the above are answers to the questions you have raised. Other issues, especially urban policies (you should quickly summarize the work in Yuncheng, Quwo, and Jincheng and send it here) and the issue of class division (based on the central document on class division), must be addressed correctly and avoid making the mistake of left-leaning adventurism. The District Party Committee must focus its main energy on mastering policies, distinguishing policy boundaries, and carefully studying and formulating strategies. After writing resolutions and instructions and reporting them, it must pay close attention to checking the work of lower levels. Do not assume that things that have been resolved by the upper levels have also been resolved by the lower levels (for example, you decided not to kill people, but the Third Prefectural Committee was killing a lot of people. Simply writing an instruction is not enough). This is often not the case. Therefore, you must have a way to understand the situation below in a timely manner, and if errors occur, you can correct them in a timely manner to avoid major mistakes. The past method of not checking regularly and only summarizing the work once every half year or a year is a complete bureaucratic method. If you wait until then to correct the errors, the losses to the Party and the people will be too great (as in the case of your Third Prefectural Committee killing people). Please pay close attention to this point. You should learn how to lead, how to implement the Party's instructions and resolutions, and take various measures: using telegrams, telephones, walking, cavalry, bicycle communication, writing letters, sending people down to check work, mastering newspapers and news agencies, and establishing regular written reports. In short, it is necessary to maintain strong ties with lower levels, so that you can know what is happening in the entire region within a week and give timely instructions within another week. Only in this way can problems be discovered, deviations corrected, experiences learned, and work in various places promoted.

　　中央局指示太岳区党委
  　坚决纠正左倾冒险主义
    正确执行中央路线、政策、方针
    【本报消息】中央局为了纠正左倾冒险主义，端正政策，正确执行中央路线、政策、方针，兹就太岳区党委所询问各问题，作如下指示：
    第一、肯定全国土地会议（冶陶会议是传达并执行全国土地会议的精神和决定的）的正确性与成绩（冶陶会议后各区整党均有成绩），在各个具体政策上，继续贯彻反左，是完全正确完全必要的。三个月来，你们纠正左倾冒险主义虽有一定成绩，但转变的仍很差，仍须继续纠正。根据你们的报告看来，在若干问题上，仍残存着左倾情绪，必须切实改正，以免在工作中，再犯更大错误。其关键，在于区党委执行中央政策和规定具体政策时，要十分明确，要分清界限，哪些事允许做，哪些事不允许做，并随时检查，确实掌握，遇有错误，立即纠正。
    第二、对你们所提各问题，具体答复如下：
    （一）团结中农问题。你们去冬侵犯中农利益，和过去错斗中农，都是带有原则性的错误，不能以“这是不对的”一句话轻轻了之，不管有无保存的未分果实，均必须给以补偿，对原则性问题，不能有丝毫动摇。现春耕在即，首应补给被斗中农部分粮食与主要生产资料，使其能安心生产，其余损失，可俟填补运动时再补。中农被封门者，一律承认错误，无条件的立即启封。被管制与登记财产者，一律无条件的立即取消。强迫中农借给贫雇款子与从合作社中强抽中农股金给贫雇，以及强借中农车辆、牲口给贫雇生产等，是片面的贫雇观点，跟着贫雇的落后性跑，是无政府主义思想，应立即无条件的如数的退还原主。被错斗的中农褫夺公民权者，应立即无条件的恢复，他们同样有加入农会、农代会与互助组之权，并可在大家民主同意下参加领导。
    （二）过去对某些罪大恶极顽强抵抗土改的地主，曾予以扫地出门处分，这本是暂时的带有教育意义的办法，如果拖的很久，则是错误的。现在对扫地出门之地主富农，必须立即给以必要的生活资料与生产资料，使其能从事生产，保证不饿死一人。如果听任饿死人、或借口土地财产已分无法解决、或借口群众打不通思想不给解决，就是坚持左倾冒险主义，就是无政府主义思想，在以后的填补中还必须补足这些被扫地出门的地主富农与农民同样的一份。你们说先启封被扫地出门的中农财产，然后再启封地主富农财产，分成两个阶段，而不是同时处理的办法是错误的，是准备饿死一部分人的。对地主特殊管制，如特殊臂章、牌号、出门请假、来客报告及其他标帜等，均应一律立即无条件的取消，不应拖至中农问题解决后再行处理，你们有分别的取消一部分，保留一部分是错误的，如果这样做，就会为下面某些人所借口，不积极去解决已经错误了的而不解决就要饿死人的严重问题，如果这样做，就不可能纠正这一错误。只有彰明昭著，顽强抵抗，众所周知，公认为是破坏土改的地主恶霸，才予以一定的管制，但这样的管制，还必需由人民法庭判决，政府公布，始能执行，各村不能私自决定。对地主富农房子，应一律立即启封，你们留有尾巴，说有内产者不启封，这也是错误的。如确知其有内产，可根据土地法大纲令其交出，不交者，可派人并协同其本人挖出，如果挖不出，就不能断定其真有，就是莫须有，就不应长期封闭。应一律禁止使用地主富农做无偿劳动，应一律立即解散所有村中的劳役队、反省院与拘留所，这是违犯政府法令违犯人民民主权利的。对地主富农妇女加以管制，如不准出嫁，必须嫁给本村人等，这是封建统制，亦须立即取消，离婚结婚保证自由，农民或干部与地主富农女儿结婚者，亦应允许，不要强制其离婚，今后愿结婚者听便。地主富农一般都是有劳动力的，应把他们组织在互助中，督促其生产，以便增加社会财富，把地主富农杀了，固然是极大的原则错误，把地主富农拒绝在生产圈外，也是极端错误和极端愚蠢的办法。
    （三）凡极端违反人民民主权利的规定或错误习惯法，均应立即废除，边府已有明令公布，你们行署亦应分别颁布命令。取消：村干宣布戒严权，一律无条件的立即摘掉过去所加于人民头上的特务帽子，恢复其公民权。废除路条制，在解放区不用路条，通行无阻，一切以利民便商为原则。
    （四）废除肉刑，严禁打人、吊人、拖人、逼死人、打死人。如确有犯罪行为，亦必须经人民法庭判决，上级批准，始能执行。判处死刑者，亦只能执行枪毙，不得采用其他任何方法。施用肉刑，是封建性的东西，共产党必须反对，不能随声附和。
    （五）对工商业（包括地富城乡工商业在内）坚决保护，不得侵犯，不准清算不准斗争工商业。不论在五四指示前或五四指示后，地主富农把财产转向合作社、工厂、或商店经营者，不能认为是化形地主（这一名词本身即是错误的，地主化形工商业者，是进步现象，允许的、欢迎的），应视为工商业，坚决保护，不得没收分配。如已斗未分，或仅算作群众股份（如所谓换神不换庙），或虽分而尚未损坏消耗者，应即退还原业主继续经营，资本不足者，政府可给以低利或无利贷款支持之（过去银行规定贷款只贷给贫雇中农的说法是错误的）。如已分配并消耗者，视情况决定追补和补偿方法。政府亦可给原业主以低利或无利贷款，务使其能重新恢复营业。对逃亡商户，应经过各种关系，争取其重返解放区营业，商店工场亦应坚决保护，有代理人者，由代理人保管，无代理人者，由政府暂代保管，俟其归来后，即交原业主经营。如确系官僚资本与最反革命分子的工商业，其没收和处理权属于行署和边府，其下级政府及其他任何机关团体，任何个人，均无没收与处理之权。边府、行署没收后，亦不得分散，须继续营业。
    （六）开明士绅是地主中之赞成反美反蒋与土改的分子。这些人是有地主立场的，但只要他们不反对土改，没有行动，就必须团结，不得排斥。朋友就是力量，必须团结，对知识分子也是采取团结政策。
    第三、以上系就你们所提出的问题，加以答复。其他问题，特别城市政策（你们应迅速将运城、曲沃、晋城工作总结做出送来）和划阶级问题（根据中央划阶级文件），必须摆的端正，不要犯左倾冒险主义的错误。区党委必须把主要精力放在掌握政策，分清政策界限，与慎重的研究规定策略，并在写出决议指示作过报告后，密切注意检查下级工作，不要以为上级解决了的事情，下面也解决了（如你们决定不杀人了，三地委却在大杀，仅仅写个指示是不行的），往往不是这样，所以你们就必须有办法及时了解下情，有错误发生，能及时纠正，不致演成大错。过去平时不检查，直到半年或一年才总结一次工作的方法，是十足的官僚主义办法，待到那时方纠正错误，党和人民的损失就太大了（如你们三地委杀人就是这样），请你们深刻注意此点，你们应学会如何领导，如何贯彻党的指示决议，要采取各种办法：用电报、电话、徒步、骑兵、自行车通讯、写信、派人下去检查工作，掌握报纸、通讯社，建立定期书面报告等。总之，要与下级保持强有力的联系，做到在一礼拜之内全区所发生的事情，你们都能知道，且不出一礼拜又都能给以及时的指示，这样才能发现问题，纠正偏向，吸取经验，推动各地工作。
