[Reported by this newspaper] The Beiguanzhuang work team, due to committing serious liberalism and abandoning leadership, was exploited by bad elements, causing the work to fall into the circle of chaotic sectarian activities. Beiguanzhuang is a village near the border of the third district of Wuzhi County, which had previously undergone a period of land reform. This time, it was designated as a base village. After the work team arrived in the village, the established work policy was: "Kick aside the old guard, deeply mobilize individual poor peasants and farm laborers..." Due to the turbulent environment, the masses sometimes gathered and sometimes dispersed, which added many difficulties to the work, and the understanding of the situation was also not deep enough. During the work team's mobilization of poor peasants and farm laborers to publicize policies, Zhang Sanlin (poor peasant, former chairman of the peasant association), Zhang Keliang (poor peasant, former militia captain), and others reflected many mistakes of the current village chief to the work team comrades, full of enthusiasm. A certain comrade of the work team did not study the situation and let him make connections. Chang Shuan'cheng, the political director, also took the opportunity to actively mobilize a small meeting of thirteen people headed by Zhang Sanlin and Zhang Kerang, and asked the work team to participate. This meeting was held four times, and the content mainly focused on replacing the village chief and engaging in sectarianism. For example, Zhang Keliang said: "If the village chief is detained for three days, you will see that the poor peasants and farm laborers in our village will rise up without mobilization!" (The village chief's corruption and embezzlement, the masses' dissatisfaction is also a fact). In this way, the atmosphere in the village was not about how the poor peasants and farm laborers should rise up to eliminate feudalism and thoroughly turn over, but rather a few people engaging in sectarianism and fighting the village chief, while most poor peasants and farm laborers remained silent. The work team also studied this situation and believed that the elimination of feudalism in this village was far from complete. The issue of village cadres was certainly a problem, but this kind of disturbance was not right and would fall into a sectarian circle, which was not the thought and demand of the majority of honest poor peasants and farm laborers at present. After the study, it was decided to kick aside this group and find other poor peasants and farm laborers. No one from the work team could participate in the meeting headed by Zhang Sanlin and others. Although this was decided, some comrades of the work team did not seriously implement it. Later, some people participated in their meetings and arranged for them to connect with poor peasants and farm laborers, which further fueled their sectarian activities. On March 16, this group connected with more than 40 people and held a meeting to establish a poor peasant group, electing the village chief. Due to the war situation, the work team dispersed again, unaware and without anyone participating. After this happened, the work team convened a mass meeting to announce the dissolution of the illegal poor peasant group, and proposed that meetings could not be convened casually without going through the work team, and this matter was temporarily stopped. The main lesson learned by the work team was the liberal attitude in their work, chaotic leadership, inconsistent steps, and each doing their own thing, which caused great losses to the work.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Editor's note: Judging from the work in Beiguanzhuang, the leadership of the work team committed serious liberalism. Although they also made self-criticisms, the understanding was extremely shallow. In a turbulent border area like Beiguanzhuang, the work team did not seriously study the situation and mobilize the masses with a serious and responsible attitude, but instead adopted a playful attitude and acted carelessly. From the beginning, they lacked the patience to deeply mobilize the poor peasants and farm laborers, but instead approached a few disgraced cadres with strong vengeful emotions; later, they also knew that they were a small number of people engaged in sectarianism, and even arranged for them to connect people again. The work team also studied this issue and made a resolution, but the policy was not firm and clear; saying that no one should participate in the sectarian activities again (this decision is unprincipled, since it is a sectarian activity, it should be resolutely dismantled and stopped, instead of just not participating), after the decision, some people in the work team casually participated, making the resolution impossible to implement and the work chaotic and out of control. This is not simply tailism in style, but serious liberalism. The comrades of this work team should make a deeper self-criticism of the harm to the work caused by this non-serious and irresponsible liberal attitude.

### 北官庄工作组放弃领导　放任自由主义闹腾　不能摆脱宗派圈子

　　北官庄工作组放弃领导
  　放任自由主义闹腾
  　不能摆脱宗派圈子
    【本报消息】北官庄工作组因犯了严重的自由主义，放弃领导，致为坏分子所乘，使工作陷入混乱的宗派活动的圈子。北官庄是武陟三区靠近边沿的村子，过去曾经过一段土改运动，这次确定为基点村。工作组到村后，确定的工作方针是：“踢开老底子，深入个别发动贫雇………”。因环境动荡，群众时而集合时而分散，使工作增加不少困难，了解情况也不够深入。在工作组进行发动贫雇宣传政策中，有张三林（贫农，前任农会主席）、张克良（贫农，前任民兵队长）等人，向工作组同志反映现任村长的许多错误，充满着劲头。工作组某同志也不研究情况即让他去串通。政治主任常拴成也趁机活动，发动以张三林、张克让为首的十三人小型会，并让工作组去参加。这会前后开了四次，内容主要是撤换村长、闹宗派。如张克良说：“如果扣起村长三天，你看俺村贫雇，不发动就起来啦！”（村长的贪污腐化，群众不满也是事实）这样一来村里的空气，不是贫雇起来如何消灭封建彻底翻身，而是少数人闹宗派斗村长，大部贫雇仍是不动不吭。工作组对这种情况也作了研究，大家认为这村封建消灭还差的多，村干问题固然也是个问题，但这样闹不大对头，会走入宗派圈子，这不是当前大多数老实贫雇的思想和要求。研究后当决定踢开这一伙另找贫雇，工作组谁也不能去参加以张三林等为首的会。这样决定，工作组有些同志并没认真执行，以后又有人参加他们的会，并布置他们串连贫雇，这样更助长了他们的宗派活动。三月十六日，这伙人串连了四十多人，开会成立了贫农团，选举了村长。这次会因战争情况，工作组又散开，不知道也没人去参加。这事发生后，工作组才又召开群众大会，宣布解散非法贫农团，并提出不经过工作组，不能随便召集会议，这事暂告停止。工作组检讨主要教训是工作中的自由主义态度，领导混乱，步调不一致，各干各的，使工作受到很大损失。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：从北官庄这段工作来看，工作组的领导上是犯了严重的自由主义的，他们虽也作了检查，但认识是极不深刻的。象北官庄这样动荡的边沿区，工作组到村不是以严肃的负责的态度来认真的研究情况发动群众，而是儿戏态度马虎从事。一开始即没耐心深入发动贫雇，而去接近几个有浓重报复情绪的下台干部；以后也知道他们是少数人闹宗派，竟还布置他们再去串连人。工作组也研究了这问题作出决议，但方针不坚决不明确；说谁也不要再参加宗派活动的会（这样决定是无原则的，既是宗派活动，就应坚决拆散制止，而不应是仅仅不去参加），决定后工作组也有人随便去参加，使决议也无法贯彻，工作混乱不可收拾。这不单纯是作风上的尾巴主义，而是严重的自由主义。这种不严肃不负责的自由主义态度，给予工作上的危害，该工作组同志应再深刻检讨。
