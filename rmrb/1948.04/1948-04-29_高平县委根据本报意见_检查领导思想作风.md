Gaoping County Party Committee Inspects Leadership Ideology and Work Style Based on This Newspaper's Opinions
To the Editors:

    The *People's Daily*'s short commentary on April 14th, "What Lessons Did Gaoping's Spring Plowing Arrangements Give Us?" and "Letting Bad Elements Undermine the Middle Peasant Policy Greatly Affected Gaoping's Spring Plowing," provided us with earnest criticism, instruction, and education regarding our serious bureaucratic work style and unclear policy thinking in leadership. We sincerely accept this and are determined to take effective measures to overcome it, reform leadership, reform ourselves, and advance our work. We are briefly informing you of the situation as follows:

    First, regarding this article in *Dazhong Bao* [Masses Daily], in addition to reflecting our bureaucratic leadership style and confusion regarding policy thinking, we also adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards this article itself, failing to examine it carefully. For example, the County Party Committee does not believe that "most villages, masses, and cadres have been greatly mobilized." At the time, the main emphasis was on the chaotic situation below, explaining the cadres' mistakes and their way out. Secondly, it was about the Party's line and policy of relying on the poor and hired peasants and consolidating the alliance of all middle peasants... and based on this, criticizing the past. There were also discrepancies in the spirit of the draft. Of course, the comrade who wrote the draft exaggerated, but the main reason was still my bureaucratic work style, and I carelessly published this draft without checking it.

    Second, since the Gaoping Great Movement and the organization of poor and hired peasant groups last winter for production, infringements on middle peasants have been serious. We understand that they can be roughly divided into two stages: The first stage was during the anti-traitor and liquidation movement. Due to our unclear class line in leadership, one-sided emphasis on anti-traitor hegemony, coupled with bureaucratic ignorance of the situation and blind emphasis on deepening the movement without promptly transitioning to rent and interest reduction, many middle peasants (and even poor peasants) were struggled against or "blackened" because they had served as village chiefs, village police, etc. (In reality, very few things, and even fewer lands, were moved; a portion of the fruits that should have been distributed were not distributed). During the filling and supplementing in 1946, some masses thought that the facts were not significant and filled and supplemented them. Secondly, last year, when organizing poor and hired peasant groups for production, there was a serious tendency to infringe on the interests of middle peasants, with managed individuals giving production to poor and hired peasants, and middle peasants who had been wrongly struggled against in the past being managed again under the guise of being targets (such as the entire Second District; the county did not arrange this). Confiscating, seizing, and borrowing money and livestock from middle peasants for the production of poor and hired peasants, etc. Before and after the Central Bureau's land conference, there were attempts to carry out struggles and secretly carry out equal distribution (such as in Busan), creating a very chaotic phenomenon.

    Third, the above situation was mainly due to the lack of a clear class line in leadership ideology. Among the village cadres, some made mistakes themselves and deliberately adopted a policy of dragging others down to make things complicated; some opportunistically infiltrated poor and hired peasant groups, seized control, and under the pretext of everything following the poor and hired peasant line... acted recklessly. But it is also true that some (a considerable number) did so out of good intentions, committing mistakes because they did not understand the Party's policy line. For example, from the Central Bureau's conference to the Prefectural Committee's reorganization, about five or six months, the Party's line and policy basically did not change, but due to my own acceptance of errors, I always felt that there had been a great change, a big turn. For example, regarding the policy towards industry, commerce, and middle peasants, sometimes I thought the past was right, sometimes I thought it was wrong. Basically, because I neither understood the actual situation nor truly grasped the spirit of the Party's policy, I produced a phenomenon of swinging either to the left or to the right.

    Fourth, in addition to the above basic reasons for this chaotic situation, there was also a long-term build-up of reviews below (but the direction was wrong, the branch cadres were impure and had connections with feudal forces, and the deeper they went, the more they infringed on middle peasants), and the branches were impure and not rectified, and almost all county and district cadres (leaving only two or three weaker cadres in each district) were concentrated at the Prefectural Committee for reorganization. After the Land Law Outline and other land reform documents were issued, there was a lack of correct propaganda and explanation. At that time, the masses were waiting for equal distribution and the cadres were waiting for struggle, which was indeed serious. After returning from the Prefectural Committee's reorganization, it was felt that production work could not be delayed. Because spring was early this year, there was excessive spring rain, and the requisitioning of labor was heavy, the village cadres were uneasy. In response to this situation, a second village cadres' conference was convened to let the village cadres know their mistakes and correct them, and to lead production, especially emphasizing efforts in production, so that the masses would forgive them in the future. Secondly, we talked about one of our land reform goals being to develop production. The line of relying on the poor and hired peasants and consolidating the alliance of middle peasants in land reform is the same in production. And we criticized the facts that were contrary to this, such as attacking poor and hired peasants and infringing on middle peasants. The Yangcun example was used to illustrate the previous problems (after the meeting, the Yangcun village chief was legally detained). Again, we explained that after one or two years of movement, we have basically implemented equal distribution, and from now on, we will only fill and supplement. And, in view of the situation below, we repeatedly emphasized that the shortcomings of past work were that the Party was impure and shielded landlords who were related to them, rather than that the landlords were not managed, and that infringing on the interests of middle peasants was wrong and harmful to the poor and hired peasants. For example, autumn loans were given to poor and hired peasants to produce well, but as a result, administrative orders managed targets, and the poor and hired peasants who were watching the targets could not produce but secretly sent things to the targets... such isolated practices of the poor and hired peasants (which have now been corrected) completely violated the Party's line and policy.

    Fifth, after receiving the newspaper, we conducted another inspection (four or five days after the conference) and found that the leadership was lax and weak. We also drew a group of cadres from the work team to strengthen the leadership of production. Because there are many accumulated problems, we can only say that these situations have largely stopped, but have not been completely resolved. Because the leadership problems were not properly resolved at first, the district cadres are mostly new cadres, the village cadres resist, the village cadres and the poor and hired peasants are opposed to each other, and the forces are cancelled out. After reorganization, some problems were solved by establishing production committees in some villages to unify leadership and resolve this contradiction.

    We don't know if the above problems are correct. We hope to receive instructions in a letter. Finally, let us reiterate that we have absolutely no dissatisfaction with the Party newspaper's criticism and education of us. We believe that it will be a key to promoting future work and transforming personal ideology and work style. We also request that you give more instructions and criticisms to our small newspaper in the future. (Gaoping County Party Committee, Li Buyun)

### 高平县委根据本报意见  检查领导思想作风

    高平县委根据本报意见
    检查领导思想作风编辑同志：
    四月十四日人民日报短评高平春耕布置给了我们什么教训，及放任坏分子破坏中农政策高平春耕受大影响两文，对我们领导上严重的官僚主义作风及政策思想不明确的批评指示教育，我们诚恳接受，并下决心采取有效办法克服，改造领导，改造个人，推进工作。兹将此事情况简略告知如下：
    第一、大众报这篇东西，除反映了我们的官僚主义领导作风与政策思想糊涂外，我们对这篇东西，也同样采取了官僚主义的态度，未加细心检查。比如对“大部村庄群众及干部已大动开了”，县委并无此估价。当时主要是强调了下面的混乱情况，说明干部错误及其出路；其次是党的路线政策，依靠贫雇巩固的联合全体中农，……并依此批判了过去。该稿在精神上也有出入。当然写稿同志有客里空，但更主要的还是我的官僚主义作风所致，对这一稿件未检查就马虎登出来了。
    第二、高平大运动及去冬生产组织贫雇组以来，侵犯中农确是严重的。我们了解大体可分两段：第一段是反奸清算大运动时，由于我们领导上的阶级路线不明确，片面的强调反奸霸，再加以官僚主义不了解情况，盲目的强调深入，未即时转入减租减息的结果，使许多中农（还有贫农）因当过闾长、村警等，被斗争或“洗脸擦黑”（实际上均动了东西，动土地的极少，一部应分果实而未分到）。在四六年填平补齐时，一部分群众认为事实不大的即填补了。其次是去年生产时组织贫雇组，又发生了严重的侵犯中农利益的倾向，管制对象给贫雇生产，把过去误斗了的中农，又以对象名义管制起来（如二区全如此，县未布置）。封门、没收、借中农钱、牲口给贫雇生产等。中央局土地会议结束前后，又有趁机进行斗争，偷偷进行平分（如釜山），造成十分混乱的现象。
    第三、上述情况，主要由于领导思想上缺乏明确的阶级路线所致，村干部中除一部分是自己犯了错误，故意采取拖人下水政策，把事情弄环；一部分投机钻入贫雇组，掌握操纵，借口一切要走贫雇路线……等胡作胡为。但也确有一部分（为数不少）是出于好意，因不了解党的政策路线所犯。如我个人从中央局会议到地委整编约五六个月，党的路线政策基本未变，但由于自己接受的错误，总是觉得有很大变化，转了个大弯子。如对工商业及中农政策，有时认为过去对了，有时又认为错了。基本上由于自己既不了解实际情况，又未真正领会党的政策的精神，所以产生或左或右摇摆的现象。
    第四、产生这种混乱情况，除上述基本原因外，还有长期在下面酝酿复查（但方向不对头，支部干部不纯，与封建有连系，越深入就越侵犯中农），和支部不纯未整，县区干部几乎全部（每区留二三个较弱干部）集中地委处整编。土地法大纲及其他土改文件发出后，缺乏正确的宣传解释，当时群众等平分、干部等斗争确是严重的。从地委整编回来后，认为生产工作不能延迟了，因今年春浅，春雨过多，支差又繁重，村干部不安。针对这一情况，即又二次召开了个村干大会，让村干部知错改错，领导生产，特别强调在生产中努力，将来群众会原谅；其次即讲我们土改目的之一为发展生产。土改中的依靠贫雇巩固的联合中农这条路线，在生产中同样。并批判了与此相反的打击贫雇、侵犯中农的事实。杨村例子是说明前面的问题的（会后杨村村长已依法扣起）。再次，说明我们经过一二年的运动，已大体实行平分，今后只是填补，并针对下面情况再三强调，过去工作毛病在党内不纯，包庇了与自己有关的地主，而不是地主没管制，侵犯中农利益不对，这对贫雇也是有害的。如秋季贷款让贫雇好好生产，结果行政命令管制对象，贫雇看守对象不能生产，反而还偷偷给对象送东西………等孤立贫雇的作法（现已纠正），这完全是违反党的路线、政策的作法。
    第五、接到报纸后，我们又作了一次检查（大会后四五天），发现领导上涣散无力，又从工作团抽出一批干部去加强领导生产。因积存问题多，现在只能说这些情况大致停止了，还未能彻底解决了，因为最初对领导问题未适当解决，区干部新干部多，村干抵抗，村干部与贫雇对立，力量对消，经过整理，有些问题的村成立生产委员会，统一领导，解决这一矛盾。
    以上问题不知对否，望来信指示。最后特再说明，我们对党报对我们的批评教育，绝无任何不满，认为对今后工作推动个人思想作风转变上，将是个关键。并要求以后对我们小报也多多指示批评为盼。      （高平县委会、李步云）
