　　Preliminary Experiences in Mobilizing Poor and Hired Peasants
    Tinghepu Work Group
    From the beginning, we paid attention to laying the foundation and taking root. We consciously visited the long-term, hard-working, and honest poor and hired peasants, lodging and eating with them intentionally. We paid attention to mobilizing them in casual conversations. At first, the poor and hired peasants didn't rely on us and were afraid to talk. The work group made a self-criticism to the poor and hired peasants: In the past, we relied on cadres, listened to the words of superior cadres, and were separated from the poor and hired peasants, preventing you from truly turning over. We declared that this time we must help you completely turn over. Through self-criticism, showing our attitude, and its impact on real life, the poor and hired peasants gradually trusted us, became closer to us, and dared to tell us some of their innermost thoughts. After three days of individual visits and mobilization, we held a small symposium with sixteen poor and hired peasants, both men and women. At this meeting, the work group humbly made a self-criticism, expressed its attitude, and the poor and hired peasants raised issues such as their failure to truly turn over, cadres taking too much of the fruits of labor, and landlords not being completely eliminated. The work group then relied on them to connect and mobilize others, mainly by visiting those who had turned over and those who had suffered. The first batch of twenty-two men and women were mobilized, and they conducted self-criticisms and mutual reviews, laying a foundation and taking root through repeated mobilization and review.

    Relying on the first batch of poor and hired peasants, we gained their trust through publicizing the Party, encouraged their enthusiasm, and continued to connect and mobilize, visiting those who had turned over and those who had suffered. Mobilization progressed from individual connections by the poor and hired peasants to collective mobilization in groups, inspiring each other and raising their class consciousness.

    The women also progressed from visiting those who had turned over and those who had suffered to finding the root of poverty, inspiring their four major demands. Gao Guitang said that her father was not close to her and sold her, causing her suffering. Cui Feng also complained that her father found her an older man, fourteen or fifteen years older than her, in order to sell her for more money. Speaking of marriage autonomy, Liu Ying said: In the old society, we were not free because of the landlords' oppression. I married a forty-three-year-old man when I was thirteen, older than my husband. Yang Chuntang said: In the past, landlords oppressed us, and our parents arranged our marriages, so we couldn't be autonomous. Today, cadres arrange it, and whoever the cadres tell us to go with, we must go. If we don't go, they won't give us a certificate and we can't leave. Gao Guitang said: Whoever holds power gets the advantage, whoever mistreats us women. After mutual deliberation and discussion, the women were also initially mobilized.

    After mobilizing the second batch of poor and hired peasants, they reviewed and drew clear lines within their groups, all determined to unite as one and separate from the landlords. Old man Wang Fengtai said: We must rectify our own organization before we can truly be masters of our own affairs. They had a demand to organize.

    From the beginning of the mobilization to the review of the second batch of poor and hired peasants, a deviation occurred in the middle. The work group didn't let go, and the poor and hired peasants were shut out. For example, the poor and hired peasant Wang Huyan was a cotton ginning worker in the cooperative, and it was said that he couldn't participate because he had connections with the cadres. Zhao Yutang was a performer and couldn't participate. The new middle peasants had already turned over and were not absorbed. This shut a large number of poor and hired peasants out (at this time, only fifty-three men and women had been mobilized, and eighty-six had not, compared to the number when the Poor Peasants' League was established). After joint research between the work group and the poor and hired peasants, the deviation was corrected, and the slogan "Open the door and stand guard, boldly mobilize" was put forward. Everyone discussed absorbing the new middle peasants and studied revising the conditions to continue boldly and deeply mobilizing.

    After connecting with almost everyone, a village-wide review was conducted to rectify our own ranks. The poor and hired peasants showed their organizational awareness at this time, sincerely and frankly reviewing themselves, boldly and straightforwardly criticizing others, and asking others to give them more opinions.

    The review process was also a process of further mutual mobilization and raising class consciousness. As a result of the review, those with minor shortcomings admitted their mistakes, expressed their attitudes, and resolved to correct themselves in the future. All 138 members of the group passed the review except for one person whose status was unclear and was temporarily put aside. More than twenty people were criticized and educated by the masses. The review showed that everyone had the most opinions about those who were sexually promiscuous and those who were gluttonous, lazy, and unwilling to move. Criticism of those who had slight connections with landlords and rich peasants was even stricter, showing their seriousness and caution in rectifying their own ranks.

    The work group paid attention to cultivating backbones from the beginning of the mobilization. After finding honest poor and hired peasants, the work group repeatedly enlightened their class consciousness and specifically helped their activity ability. For example, the first batch of eight served as members of the Poor Peasants' League, seven served as group leaders, and fifteen were selected as Party rectification representatives. In our approach, we did not initially select group leaders, but the most supported by the masses emerged in the work and could become cadres. This was very democratic. The work group adopted a helping attitude towards the poor and hired peasants, which easily stimulated their enthusiasm, and continued to discover and cultivate activists in the Party rectification.

　　发动贫雇初步经验
    停河辅工作组
    开始我们就注意了打基础扎根子，就有意识访常年劳动的老实贫雇，住宿和吃饭都是有意识到贫雇家。在闲扯闲拉中注意发动。开始贫雇对我们不依靠不敢谈，工作组就向贫雇自我检讨：过去我们来了是依靠干部，听上干部话和贫雇隔开了，叫咱们贫雇没有翻了身，说明今次一定要为咱贫雇翻透身。经过自我检讨表明态度和在实际生活中的影响，贫雇逐渐相信了我们，和我们密切起来，稍敢给我们说些心思话。经过三天的个别访问发动，召开了男女十六个贫雇农小型座谈会，在这会上工作组很虚心作了自我检讨，表明了态度，贫雇提出了自己没有翻身，干部多占果实，地主没有彻底消灭等，工作组就依托他们去串通发动，主要是访翻身访痛苦。第一批发动起男女二十二个，他们进行了自我检讨互相审查。经过反复发动审查，打下基础扎下根子。
    依靠第一批贫雇，经过党的公开，取得贫雇相信，鼓舞了他们的积极性，继续串通发动，访翻身访痛苦，由贫雇个别串通到小组的集体发动，互相启发，提高了阶级觉悟。
    妇女们也由访翻身访痛苦到找穷根，启发她们的四大要求。高贵堂说，她父亲和她不亲，把他卖了受痛苦；翠凤也是怨她父为了多卖钱，给找了一个大男人，比她大十四五岁。谈到婚姻自主，刘英说：在旧社会地主逼的我们就不能自由，我十三岁嫁给一个四十三岁的老汉，比我老公还大哩。杨春堂说：过去地主压迫、父母包办咱婚姻不能自主，今天是干部包办，干部叫走谁就得走谁，不走给人家就不行，不给写证明，不能往外走。高贵堂说：谁掌权谁得便，谁刻薄咱妇女。经过互相酝酿讨论，妇女也初步发动。
    发动起贫雇第二批后，按小组互相审查划清界限，都坚决要团结成一条心，与地主分家。王逢台老汉说：总得把我们自己的组织整顿好，才能真正当家掌权，他们有了组织起来的要求。
    从开始发动到审查第二批贫雇时，这中间发生了一种偏向，工作组不放手，雇贫关门。如贫雇王虎彦是合作社的轧花工人，说他和干部有连系不能参加；赵玉堂是个唱戏的不能参加；新中农已翻了身啦，也不吸收；使一大批贫雇关在门外（这时只发动了男女五十三个，还有八十六个未发动，系按成立贫农团时人数来比）。经工作组和贫雇共同研究纠正了偏向，提出“开门站岗，放手发动”的口号，大家讨论吸收新中农参加，并研究修改条件，继续放手深入发动。
    串连差不多了，进行全村的大审查，整顿自己的队伍。贫雇在这时都表现了自己的组织觉悟，很诚恳坦白的检讨自己，大胆直爽的批评旁人，都要求别人对自己多提意见。
    审查过程，也是进一步互相发动提高阶级觉悟的过程；审查结果，缺点较小的都认错表态度，决心今后改正，全体团员中除一人因成份不明暂时搁住外，一百三十八人均通过，二十余人受到群众指责教育。从审查中看出大家对性乱和好吃喝懒动弹的人意见最多，对和地主富农稍有过连系的人批评更是严格，表现了对整理自己队伍的认真和慎重。
    工作组开始入手发动，即注意了培养骨干问题。找到老实贫雇后，工作组反复的启发他的阶级觉悟，具体的帮助他们的活动能力，如第一批八个担任了贫农团委员，七个担任了小组长，十五个选为整党代表，我们做法上开始不选小组长，在工作中涌现出来群众最拥护者，可成为干部。这样是很民主的。工作组对贫雇是采取帮助态度，这样容易发挥贫雇的积极性，在整党中继续发现培养积极分子。
