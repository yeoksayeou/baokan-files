Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, April 26th: The CCP Northwest Central Bureau issued a circular on April 23rd to celebrate the recapture of Yan'an, stating: (1) Yan'an was recaptured by us on the 21st of this month, as a result of the victorious offensive of our Northwest People's Liberation Army. Our powerful field army, after annihilating the headquarters of the Kuomintang-Hu bandit army's reorganized 29th Army and two divisions and five brigades, and liberating eight counties in Huanglong, advanced between the Jing and Wei Rivers, successively capturing ＠ County, Changwu, Yongshou, Linyou, Fufeng, Lingtai, and other places, and is now continuing to expand its offensive, causing the enemy to suffer blows from both the front and rear. The enemy, isolated in Yan'an, had no choice but to flee in panic under the attacks of our local armed forces. The enemies still entrenched in Luochuan, Qingyang, and Heshui are even more panicked and face the fate of being wiped out. The Northwest Bureau extends warm congratulations to our heroic field army and all local armies, guerrilla units, and militias.

(2) Local corps, guerrilla units, and militias should more actively besiege and attack the enemy entrenched in a few remaining isolated strongholds, eliminate reactionary bandit gangs, and bravely pursue the enemy. The liberation of Yan'an has not reduced the importance of our military work in the old liberated areas. On the contrary, we must further strengthen the training and leadership of local corps, guerrilla units, and militias, continue to improve their combat effectiveness and political quality, understand policies, strictly observe discipline, be good at doing mass work, and continue to grow in strength, always be prepared for enemy counterattacks, defend the old liberated areas, cooperate with the field army in combat, and develop new areas, so that the field army can more freely attack the KMT-controlled areas and annihilate the enemy.

(3) The liberation of Yan'an has not reduced the responsibility of our work in the old liberated areas. Not only must we vigorously carry out production and various restoration works, but we must also continue to strive to support the front lines. It is still all for the front lines, all for developing new areas. Only by developing new areas can the old areas be finally consolidated. The old liberated areas have the responsibility to transfer and train a large number of cadres with experience, correct ideology, work style, and understanding of policies to supply the new areas continuously. The most glorious post for a communist is on the front lines.

(4) In newly liberated areas, we must mobilize and organize the masses with internal forces, and correctly implement the Party's policies, unite the greatest majority of the people, persist in repeated struggles against the enemy, assist our army in combat, supply the needs of the troops, and consolidate every liberated area.

(5) All localities and armies should convene meetings and take various forms to celebrate the recapture of Yan'an. We must explain the current situation and tasks to the entire Party, the entire army, and all cadres and the masses, and encourage confidence in victory, but oppose any tendency to slacken. We are not far from reaching the final victory, but there is still a difficult struggle ahead. Everyone must make unremitting efforts in their work until the complete elimination of Chiang Kai-shek's rule.

    中共西北中央局发出通告
    庆祝解放军收复延安
    号召做好工作加速最后胜利
    【新华社西北二十六日电】中共西北中央局为庆祝收复延安，于四月二十三日发出通告称：（一）延安于本月二十一日为我收复，这是我西北人民解放军胜利进攻的结果。我强大野战军在歼灭蒋胡匪军整编二十九军军部及两个师五个旅并解放黄龙八个县后，挺进泾渭之间，连克＠县、长武、永寿、麟游、扶风、灵台等地，现继续扩张攻势，使敌腹背受创。孤守延安之敌不得不在我地方武装围击下狼狈逃窜，现尚困守洛川、庆阳、合水的敌人更形恐慌，面临覆灭命运。西北局特向我英勇的野战军和一切地方军、游击队、民兵热烈道贺。
    （二）各地方兵团、游击队、民兵应更加积极的困击孤守少数残余据点之敌，肃清反动团匪，并勇猛追击敌人。延安光复后并没有减轻我老区军事工作的重要性，恰恰相反，必须更加加强地方兵团、游击队、民兵的整训和领导，继续提高战斗力和政治素质，懂得政策，严守纪律，会做群众工作，并继续壮大，时刻防备敌人反攻，保卫老区，配合野战军作战，开展新区，使野战军更放手进击蒋管区，歼灭敌人。
    （三）延安光复后也没有减轻我老区工作的责任，不但必须大力进行生产和各项恢复工作，而且必须继续努力支援前线，依然是一切为了前线，一切为了开展新区，只有开展新区才能使老区最后巩固。老区有责任抽调和训练大批有经验、有正确思想、作风，懂得政策的干部源源供给新区。共产党人最光荣的岗位是在前线。
    （四）新解放的地区必须以内部力量发动和组织群众，并正确地执行党的政策，团结最大多数人民，坚持反复和敌人斗争，协助我军作战，供应部队需要，把每一个解放了的地区巩固起来。
    （五）各地各军都应召开会议和采取各种形式庆祝收复延安，要向全党全军，向所有干部和群众讲解目前形势与任务，鼓舞胜利信心，但反对任何松懈自己的倾向，我们到达最后胜利已为期不远，但尚是一段艰苦的斗争过程，必须每一个人都毫不松懈的努力自己的工作，直至彻底消灭蒋介石的统治。
