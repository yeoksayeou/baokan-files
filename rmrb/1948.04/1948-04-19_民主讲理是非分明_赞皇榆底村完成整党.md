　　Democracy Stresses Reason and Distinguishes Right from Wrong
  　Zanhuang Yudicun Completes Party Rectification
    The work team of Zanhuang Yudicun arrived in the village on March 10th. After a preliminary understanding of the situation, they first convened a branch meeting to openly mobilize the Party. On March 12th, a mass meeting was held to mobilize the masses to prepare opinions to assist the Communist Party in examining Party members and to supervise Party members in the future. After the mass meeting, the vast majority of Party members were conscientiously reflecting on themselves, with only a few Party members "lying down."
    In order to examine the reflections, the first branch meeting was held on the night of the 15th, inviting ten poor peasants and farm laborers to participate. Before the meeting, both sides made simple mobilizations, explaining that Party members' reflections should be specific and carry out self-criticism within the Party; everyone should cherish the Communist Party, help transform Party members, and offer criticisms of Party members' mistakes. At the beginning, Bai Erba reflected, but only on some scattered minor matters, without mentioning larger mistakes. Representatives of the poor peasants and farm laborers offered the opinion, "Knowing mistakes and correcting them doesn't count as a mistake. If you have mistakes and correct them, everyone will still deal with you. For example, after Zhou ×× in our village corrected his mistakes, everyone still considers him a good cadre." At this time, the work team expressed its attitude, pointing out that if the reflection was not good and the attitude was not correct, they should reflect again. Then Zhang Laoxin reflected, with a better attitude and a better reflection on his mistakes. After the reflection, the poor peasants and farm laborers said, "Laoxin's reflection is pretty good, no more opinions." Laoxin also said, "If I say it and get smashed to death, I won't say anything. If not, I'll say anything." This meeting clearly told the Party members that as long as they reflected well, the masses could forgive them, which encouraged the Party members to reflect.
    After the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League, and the collusion to establish a new farmers association began, Party members requested to reflect and take sides. On the night of March 26th, the second branch meeting was held, inviting members of the Poor Peasants' League and representatives of middle peasants to participate. Bai Aichen first reflected that his class background was good, but his awareness was low, his struggle against the landlord was not resolute, and he did work only when it suited him, and not when it didn't. As soon as he finished speaking, Party member Li Yinping criticized him for not obeying the Party's policies. Immediately following, a middle peasant representative, Li Sanquan, said: It is not that he does not obey the policies of the Communist Party, but that he does not understand the position of the Communist Party. A group leader of the Poor Peasants' League said: He is unwilling to fight feudalism, his ideology is backward, and his position is not well-established; his lack of enthusiasm for work is because he has not fulfilled his responsibilities and has not served the masses. Aichen stood up and replied to everyone that he would change in the future. The second Party member, Dong Diao, reflected that he had a bad work style as a public security officer, oppressing the masses, and the masses were dissatisfied. This time, his attitude change was still lacking (the masses paid close attention to this point), the masses raised many opinions, and finally he was asked to reflect again.
    The above two branch meetings with the participation of the masses were preparatory meetings for the mass meeting to rectify the Party, an inevitable process from small rectification to large rectification, which is much better than the "closed-door" Party member reflection preparation meeting. From the perspective of Party members, it is a reflection and examination, dispelling the Party members' fear of being beaten and hanged by the masses, and daring to reflect on mistakes; from the perspective of the masses, it is a democratic enlightenment, and it also solves some of the distrust of Party rectification.
    The official mass meeting for Party rectification began on the 27th. Beforehand, the work team learned about the good and bad reflections of the students and the number of problems; then batches of reflections were made, and individuals were examined. After three days and nights of reflection by Party members, extensive democratic proposals, the masses showed a very serious attitude, the leadership grasped the heat, guided the discussion to distinguish right from wrong, transformed Party members, and educated the masses.
    Because the Party in this village was developed in March 1946, and the branch was officially established in March 1947 with a total of twelve Party members, nine of whom were poor peasants and farm laborers, although the style of seizing more fruits in the movement was undemocratic, most Party members and the masses were able to maintain a general relationship. In addition, this time, under the pressure of the masses, the reflection was better. Therefore, eight Party members passed easily, and four Party members underwent a second reflection. Zhang Laoxin served as a custodian in the land reform and took more fruits. Because he was illiterate and his accounts were unclear, after his reflection, the poor peasant Bai Zhiyun immediately proposed: It's nothing that you took more fruits, but the poor households didn't get any, and the rich households got it to sell. Li Rongzi stood up and said loudly: I am Rongzi, with five people in my family and seven mu and three fen of land, and I was only given seven fen of bad land. Then Dong Luqin's mother said: You asked Luqin to stand guard, but my family had no clothes to wear. When it was cold, I borrowed a pair of pants from the storage room and gave them back broken, unable to wear. But your family of three borrowed three suitable ones to wear, and your father even borrowed a big padded jacket. Some of the masses asked: Your family didn't get that set of ropes, why do you have this thing? The masses expressed their opinions to their hearts' content. Laoxin replied: Everyone is right, it's just that I can't check the fruits, everyone can mention anything they know again. I am also a poor person, and I have forgotten my roots and taken more fruits, and I am not responsible for the fruits, and I have also oppressed the masses. Everyone's proposals are helping to educate me. After the discussion, the poor peasant Bai Zhiyun proposed again, when the things in the box were also gone, he then remembered and said: Dong Diao was responsible at that time. This problem was the most heatedly debated. After the second reflection and the debate of the masses, everyone unanimously believed that he was just a bit selfish and self-interested, but he was very loyal to the Eighth Route Army! He is illiterate and cannot calculate the accounts clearly, so let him clean up the storage room. Then Dong Diao reflected again. The masses pointed out that he had contributed dozens of catties less of public grain last year during the evaluation of burdens. Another person said: He is a public security officer, he can go to Yuanshi to buy salt at will, but others can't go, and others need a stamp to go out, but Diao's wife can walk around at will. When Dong Diao replied that it was martial law and no one could leave, the masses questioned: It is said that anyone can't go, aren't you in the count? He quickly said: I am wrong, relying on my position as a public security officer. Then the former branch secretary, now district cadre Liu Zhagen, reflected that his main problem was his work style. If someone's words did not suit him, he would say to detain them. If someone was late for the meeting, he would make them confess in front of everyone. Zhang Lianhe's daughter-in-law was elected as a cadre, but she didn't want to do it, and others couldn't call her, so he said to go. One militiaman quickly ran to say: Hurry up, Lao Zha is coming! No one dared to say anything at the meeting, and anyone who didn't shout slogans would be asked what they were thinking. Some women heard this and said: This is also a mistake! That must be changed.
    The masses were very cautious and serious in examining the Party members, and the work team also explained that Communist Party members work for the masses, and not working is a violation of Communist Party discipline. Mistakes may be made in handling affairs, but it is necessary to distinguish between the severity of the mistakes, apportion responsibilities, and clarify the facts. For example, it was proposed against Erqiu that his two sons had a relationship with the daughter of Liu Luolian, who was a target of struggle. Everyone argued endlessly, saying: This was reflected by the target of struggle, which is unreliable. In order to carefully clarify the facts, the masses selected three poor peasants and farm laborers, Dong Xi and others, to be responsible for the investigation, and the result was that there was no such fact. Dong Yichang's proposal to clear the household registration, during the night, turned over the jars and buckets in his house. Everyone argued: It doesn't count as an opinion, at that time the enemy was constantly coming, it should be so careful.
    As the congress progressed to the end, the masses discussed the issue of disciplinary action against party members. Some suggested that so-and-so should be expelled, but others disagreed, saying: Laoxin's mistake is only selfishness and self-interest, and his reflection is good; Dong Diao's reflection is not good, and they cannot be treated the same. An old man followed up and said: As long as they reflect well and change, there is no need for punishment. For Aichen, everyone said that he fought the enemy resolutely and actively, but later he did not work properly, so he can be educated. Finally, the work team stated that everyone's opinions would be submitted to the county party committee for discussion and decision, explaining that this was a party procedure. The masses all said: The Communist Party is very cautious, and does not wrong anyone.
    In order to clarify the facts and speak their minds, the masses requested non-party cadres to reflect. The working group accepted this view and did its best to help them. But because there were many non-party cadres, the working group consulted with the masses and decided to have those with many problems nominated by the masses to reflect, and carried out in batches according to the nature of the work. The opinions of the masses were mainly unfair distribution of fruits, burdens, preferential treatment of military families, and work style administrative orders.
    After the meeting, the Party members felt that it was not easy to be a Communist Party member. Laoxin proposed that he would stand on the Party's position in the future and work for the masses to the end. Dong Diao also proposed that even if he was not a cadre or was expelled from the Party, he would still serve the people. Finally, the two of them said: In the past, there was no goal, but now there is a goal. China is so big, and they are happy to have a share in the victory. In the future, standing on the Party's position, determined to do it, it's nothing, the eyes of the masses are bright. The masses reflected that the Communist Party tells the truth, and the superiors also examine themselves, and whoever is wrong is whoever is wrong.
    At this point, the Party rectification has come to an end. Party members have been absorbed into the farmers' association, and new farmers' associations have been established one after another. Party member Liu Sifang was also elected as the chairman of the farmers' association, Bai Aichen and Dong Silu were elected as formal alternate members, and Liu Sifang was elected as the branch secretary within the Party, and Dong Diao was elected as the deputy branch secretary.

　　民主讲理是非分明
  　赞皇榆底村完成整党
    赞皇榆底村工作组，三月十号到达该村，经初步了解情况后，首先召开了支部会，进行公开党的动员。十二号群众大会上动员群众准备意见，协助共产党审查党员，并在今后监督党员。群众大会后，绝大部分的党员，都在用心的反省自己，只有个别党员“躺倒”。
    为检查反省，十五日夜，召开了第一次支部大会，请十位贫雇参加。会前双方作了简单的动员，说明党员反省要具体，开展党内自我批评；大家要爱护共产党，帮助改造党员，对党员的错误要提出批评。开头由白二八反省，只反省了些零星小事，比较大的错误未谈。贫雇代表提意见说：“知错改错不算错，有错改错大家不能不和你打交道，如咱村周××改错后，大家还认为是好干部。”这时，工作组表示了态度，指出反省不好，态度还不正确再反省。继有张老欣反省，态度与错误反省较好，反省后贫雇说：“老欣反省还觉得差不多，没啥意见了。”老欣又说：“如果我说了，要被砸死的话，我啥也不说，这样我啥也要说的”。这个会明显的告诉了党员，只要反省的好，群众就可原谅，鼓励了党员反省。
    贫农团成立后，与串通成立新农会的开始，党员要求反省站队。三月廿六日夜，召开了第二次支部大会，请贫农团委员中农代表参加。白爱辰首先反省他成份好，觉悟低，斗争地主不坚决，工作是顺自己心就干，不顺自己心不干。刚说毕，党员李银平批评他不服从党的政策。紧接一位中农代表李三全说：他不是不服从共产党的政策，是他不懂共产党的立场。一位贫农团小组长说：他不愿斗封建，是思想落后，立场没站好；工作不积极是没负到责任，没给群众服到务。爱辰立起答复了大家，今后要改。第二个党员董刁反省，他任公安员作风不好，欺压群众，群众不满。这次反省态度转变还差（群众极注意这点），群众提出很多的意见，最后让他重反省。
    以上两次群众参加支部大会，是群众大会整党的预备会议，从小整到大整必有的过程，这比“关着门”的党员反省准备会要好的多。从党员讲，是反省检查，解除了党员怕群众打吊的思想，敢于反省错误；对群众来讲，是民主的启发，也解决了些对整党不相信的思想。
    二十七号正式开始群众大会整党，事前工作组分头了解了学员的反省好坏，问题多少；然后一批批的反省，一个个的审查，党员经三天一夜的反省，广泛的民主提议，群众表现了非常认真、严肃，领导上抓着火候，诱导讨论辨明是非，改造了党员，教育了群众。
    因这村的党是一九四六年三月发展，到一九四七年三月共十二个党员正式建立的支部，贫雇成份九人，虽运动中多占果实作风不民主，大部党员和群众尚能保持一般关系，又加这次在群众的压力下反省较好。因此有八个党员很容易的通过，四个党员进行了二次反省。张老欣土改中任保管委员多占果实，自己不识字，帐目不清，经他反省后，随即有贫农白志云提出：你多占果实没有啥，可是穷户没分上，富户分上出去卖。李荣子立起大声说：我是荣子，五口人，七亩三分地，只给了我坏地七分。继有董路秦娘说：叫俺路秦站岗，俺家没衣裳穿，天冷去保管室借一条裤子还给坏的，不能穿。可是你家三口人，借的三个合适穿的，你爹还借了一个大袄。有的群众提：你家没分到那付绳套，为什么有这东西？群众尽情的提出意见。老欣答复说：大家说的都对，就是拿果实我检查不出来，大家知道啥可再提。我也是穷人来，忘了本多占果实，对果实不负责，还压迫过群众，大家提出来是帮助教育我。谈后贫农白志云又提出，箱子内东西为什么也没了时，他才想起说：当时是董刁负责来。对他这问题吵的最热烈，经二次的反省，群众的争辩，大家一致认为他就是有点自私自利，对八路军可忠实哩！他不识字，帐也算不清，让他好好清理下保管室吧。继有董刁再反省，群众提出他去年评议负担，自己少出了几十斤公粮。另一人说：他是公安员，自己可随便到元氏买盐，别人不能去，别人出门盖章，刁的老婆可随便走。在董刁答复到出门盖章是戒严，任何人不能走时，群众质问：说是任何人，你不在数？他紧着说：我不对，仗势自己是公安员。接着前任支书现为区干刘扎根反省，他主要是作风问题。说话不合意即说扣起来。到会迟，即让在大家面前坦白。张连河的儿媳妇被当选干部，不干，别人叫不到，他就说去。一个民兵即赶快跑去说：快去吧，老扎来了！开会谁也不敢说什么，谁不喊口号，就要问啥思想。一些妇女听到这里，说：这也是错误啊！那可要改。
    群众对党员的审查非常慎重认真的，工作组亦解释了共产党员是给群众办事的，不工作即是违犯了共产党的纪律。办事可能犯错误，但要分清轻重，分别责任，辨明事实。如对二秋提出他二子和斗争对象刘洛连的妮子有关系。大家争论不休说：这是斗争对象反映的，不可靠。群众为慎重弄明是非，选了贫雇董喜等三人负责调查，结果是没有这事实。对董益昌提出的清查户口，夜间到他家把缸里斗子里都翻了。大家争吵着说：不算意见，那时敌人不断来，应该那样仔细。
    大会进行到最后，群众讨论党员处分问题。有的提出谁谁要开除，但有的不同意，提出：老欣的错误，只是自私自利，反省的好；董刁反省不好，不能一样。一个老汉紧接着说：只要反省好改了，不用处分。对爱辰，大家说他打敌人坚决积极，后来不好好工作，可教育。最后由工作组声明，把大家意见，提到县委会讨论决定，说明这是党的手续。群众都说：共产党可慎重哩，不冤屈一个人。
    群众为弄明是非，说透心事，要求非党干部反省。工作组接受了这个意见，并尽力对他们帮助。但因非党干部多，工作组与群众商量，确定毛病多的，群众提名来反省，按工作性质分批进行。群众的意见主要是分配果实不公、负担、优待军属的问题和作风行政命令。
    大会后，党员觉得共产党员不好当。老欣提出，今后要站在党的立场上，为群众干到底。董刁也提出总使不当干部，开除党籍，也要为人民办事。最后他二人说：过去没有目标，现在有了目标，中国这样大，胜利有咱一份也高兴。今后站在党的立场上，决心干，没啥，群众的眼睛是亮的。群众反映共产党是讲真理的，上级也检讨，谁的错即是谁的错。
    至此，整党已告结束，党员被吸收到农会，相继成立新农会。党员刘四方又当选了农会主席，白爱辰、董四六选为正式候补委员，党内也选刘四方任支书，董刁任副支书。（榆底工作组）
