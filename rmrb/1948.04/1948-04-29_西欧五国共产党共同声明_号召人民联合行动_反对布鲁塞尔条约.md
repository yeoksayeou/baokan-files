Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. London dispatch: The Communist Parties of France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg issued a joint statement on the 24th, calling on all working people of the five countries to unite and act, "to defend peace and social progress, rise up against the treaty signed by their governments in Brussels, and completely smash this war-seeking plan." The statement believes that the treaty is "part of the expansion plan of US imperialism against peace and people's democratic countries." The statement also pointed out that this treaty is a development of the Marshall Plan, characterized by aggression and open war preparations, "it does not conform to the interests of the working people, nor does it conform to the aspirations of the contracting countries, and it does not help solve any of their economic problems, and because West Germany is included in the countries accepting the Marshall Plan, this treaty further increases the danger of West German aggression." The statement pointed out: "If the people of our five countries unite and act, it will greatly strengthen the democratic forces of the world, and the forces of war will be weakened and completely defeated."
