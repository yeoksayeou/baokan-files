　　Zhao Village completes land redistribution smoothly by satisfying the demands of poor and hired peasants and consolidating unity with middle peasants.
　　Excluding Middle Peasant Land and Population
　　Prevents Too Wide Impact

　　Zhao Village's land redistribution work was successfully completed by the 13th of this month. This was because sufficient preparation was made before the redistribution, and the masses had been preparing through land measurement, classification of class status, and yield assessment movements, which were all closely linked to the redistribution. After long-term education and enlightenment, the masses' awareness has been greatly improved. During the redistribution, the masses had matured in their understanding of the policy of satisfying the demands of poor and hired peasants, closely uniting with middle peasants, and correcting the class status of wrongly-struggled households. They were able to grasp it well, and the redistribution proceeded very quickly.

　　(1) Land Redistribution: First, an overview of Zhao Village's land: Zhao Village originally had a population of 2099 people, with 8198.2 mu of land, and a yield of 7647.85 shi. The average number of mu per person was 3.91 mu, and the average yield was 3.64 shi (based on the original land and population). After land measurement and yield assessment, the population increased to 2157 (due to new households, returning households, and newborn children), the land was 7870.7 mu, and the yield was 5341.07 shi. The average land per person was 3.649 mu, and the yield was 2.476 shi.

　　Second, calculation of the village's average yield and the yield that land-receiving households should receive: After research, if the average number obtained by dividing the village's total land by the village's total population is used as the basis for land redistribution, the yield that receiving households need to receive will be too large, which is guaranteed to cause errors of disrupting equal division, absolute averaging, and impacting middle peasants. Therefore, Zhao Village first excluded the middle peasants' land and population from the village's total land and population, and then averaged the remaining land among the other population to obtain the average yield as the basis for land redistribution. In this way, the number obtained was an average of 3.483 mu per person, and the yield was 2.418 shi. Because households with one or two people had to be taken care of, the redistribution was carried out at 2.3 shi. A total of 149 households and 537 people in the village received land, receiving 728.112 mu of land and 522.26 shi.

　　Middle Peasants Voluntarily Offer Land Entirely From Their Hearts

　　Third, land redistribution targets and land offering: According to the average yield, a total of 112 households, including party members, families of soldiers, and newly liberated households who occupied too much land, were designated to release land, with a yield of 374.79 shi. Middle peasants voluntarily offered land, contributing a yield of 146.78 shi. The total yield of land given up was 521.57 shi. Public land (including land from families without heirs) was recovered, amounting to 73.15 mu, with a yield of 39.42 shi. The total yield of all land released was 560.99 shi. The principle of voluntariness was particularly emphasized when middle peasants offered land. When they offered land, the work team comrades and the farmers' association members repeatedly stated the policy of not impacting middle peasants, explaining that if they wished to take out land to help poor and hired peasant brothers to stand up, it must be entirely from their hearts, and they must not offer more than their due share of the yield. Even so, many middle peasants still offered land. For example, Zhao Shunxi, who had more than four shi more than his due share, was uneasy, fearing that the masses would say that he was not enlightened. The work comrades saw his intention and repeatedly stated the policy, saying that he did not have to offer it, and it was completely voluntary. Finally, he said: "Then I'll just keep planting it, but the masses will have a lot to say!" After repeated back-and-forths like this, in the end, the land was still "planted by himself."

　　Fourth, principles of land redistribution: The Farmers' Representative Conference resolved that when releasing land, one person would retain the yield for two people, and two people would retain the yield for three people, and no land would be taken from those with one-tenth more. When receiving land, because the released yield was not enough to distribute, land was distributed according to the actual population. One person received the yield for one person, with some consideration for those needing a little extra, two people received the yield for two people, and those with three or more people would receive one-tenth less. Poor and hired peasants who planted too much bad land could exchange it for better land or nearby land with the approval of the Farmers' Representative Conference based on the actual situation. In addition, those who declared that they did not need to receive the full yield due to insufficient labor or other reasons would not be forced to receive the full yield.

　　Fifth, population issues during land redistribution: Veteran soldier Meng Nuozi bought a child from Wu'an City the day before the land redistribution, in the rain, preparing to distribute land. Other adopted children also had disputes due to land distribution. Some requested to establish their own households, while others argued over children. In order to prevent speculation, the Farmers' Representative Conference set several rules: 1. Those who separated their families after the promulgation of the Land Law would not be counted. 2. Even if the families had separated before, but actually still lived together, they would still be treated as not separated. 3. Those who had been away for three years without news would not be counted. 4. If the father died and the mother remarried, the mother had the right to bring her children, and the land distribution could follow her current family. 5. Revolutionary soldiers who were single and away from home would also be distributed land and houses, but before they returned, the land and houses could be temporarily lent to others. 6. Widows with sons, even if they were separated from their sons, would not be treated the same as ordinary people without sons. 7. Children born during the land distribution period (i.e., after the establishment of various new institutions) would count as one person, and children bought for speculation would not count as a person.

　　Specialists Responsible for Assessment, Democratic Discussion and Revision

　　Sixth, land filling method: Specialized personnel were responsible for calculating, filling, and piecing together the land. The existing land of the land-receiving households was divided into four grades according to the yield, and the amount of yield needed for each grade was calculated. Then, the amount of yield of each grade in the land was calculated in the same way (eight dou or more was the first grade, six to eight dou was the second grade, four to five dou was the third grade, and less than four dou was the fourth grade). Then, each grade was added up separately, and the number of mu of each grade that each person should get was obtained by dividing it by the population of the land receiving, and then the filling was carried out. The bad land was filled with the first and second grades, and the good land was filled with the third and fourth grades. The yield was made up to 2.3 shi per person, and good and bad land was appropriately adjusted for each family (about seven cents for the first grade, one mu for the second grade, one and a half mu for the third grade, and the fourth grade was filled up). After the filling was completed, the list was posted for the masses to make suggestions and modify it, and the Farmers' Representative Conference revised and passed it, and then the list was posted for final approval.

　　Seventh, results of land filling and exchange: In addition to filling the yield needed by the land-receiving households, some people did not want land and were given additional floating property to satisfy them. A total of 23 households of poor peasants and new middle peasants exchanged land. As a result of exchanging good land and withdrawing bad land, together with the remaining land after filling, there were 78.66 mu and 35.82 shi remaining. These remaining land was posted and lent to farmers to cultivate. In short, after the land redistribution, except for a very small number of people who did not want land, everyone else was given 2.3 shi. Among the wrongly-struggled middle peasants, those who had a large shortage of land yield in the past were also filled this time. For example, Zhao Changshan, before being wrongly struggled, had only ten mu of land for five people, Jin Shuye had only three or four mu of bad land for four people, and Zhao Youshan had only five mu of land for four people. This time, the yield was filled up for them. After the middle peasants offered land, they were still higher than the average, with an average of 2.628 shi per person.

　　Eighth, several problems in the land redistribution: (1) Before the land redistribution, the middle peasants' land must be removed to obtain the average yield of the remaining land divided by the total population of the village, excluding middle peasants. The average number obtained in this way is more reasonable, because even if the middle peasants do not move, or move very little, the excessive yield of the middle peasants cannot be added to the average. (2) When releasing land, one person retains the yield for two people, and two people retain the yield for three people. When calculating the average number of the whole village (excluding middle peasants), the virtual population of one person retaining the yield for two people should be calculated in. The land release will be more practical. Zhao Village did not include this in time. If the virtual population is included, the land release can be completed by filling in one person as two people and two people as three people. (3) When the yield needed to release land is not enough to distribute, the masses should be reported and solved by the masses themselves, but the left-leaning emotions in the masses must be prevented. When Zhao Village first announced that the yield needed to release land was not enough, some farmers said: "If the middle peasants don't move, the land will not be a middle peasant if there is too much. The extra should be taken out." "I think this yield is still in the hands of the middle peasants." "If the middle peasants don't move, let's divide it up among the poor and hired people, and then work as long-term workers for the middle peasants!" Although these words were corrected by the majority of the masses, the averageism and left-leaning emotions among the farmers erupted at any time, and special attention must be paid and enlightened education must be given immediately. (4) The average yield per mu of the land releasing households was not calculated in detail when releasing the land, so the land quality of the land releasing households after releasing land was still higher than that of the land receiving households. (5) The quality of the land of military cadres and martyrs' families should be higher (calculated at the time of calculation), because the land of military cadres and martyrs' families still needs to be cultivated by ordinary farmers, and it is still ordinary farmers who suffer from more missed work. Most of the land exchanging households this time are the new anti-Japanese families who joined the army last year.

　　Village Houses Are Not Enough for Land Redistribution: Appropriate Repair Costs Are Issued

　　(2) Housing distribution: Zhao Village feels the most difficult about housing. The Farmers' Representative Conference stipulated: (1) Those who live in one room for more than two generations can be supplemented with houses or exchanged for houses. (2) Those who have a large population and the houses are too narrow can be supplemented with exchanged houses. (3) Those who can't live in houses that are about to collapse can exchange houses or supplement floating property for repairs. Many people in the village proposed to exchange houses or repair houses; but because of the lack of houses, only the following households were supplemented and exchanged for houses: 19 wrongly-struggled middle peasants returned to their original houses, a total of 53 rooms; 25 households exchanged houses, and a total of 5 rooms were supplemented; 10 anti-Japanese families exchanged for good houses and supplemented 17 rooms; 64 households of poor peasants exchanged houses and supplemented 105 rooms, 65 rooms were exchanged; the original houses stored in the Farmers' Association were a total of 390 rooms, and 330 rooms were supplemented and exchanged this time, the remaining 60 rooms were occupied by the village government and the school. Therefore: (1) The requirements of poor and hired peasants were also satisfied as much as possible in the housing problem; at the same time, the houses of the wrongly-struggled middle peasants were filled in, and they were satisfied. (2) For those who asked to repair houses, because many were exchanged, and because there were too many households to actually repair, they had to follow the regulations of the Farmers' Representative Conference, and only those who could not live in houses that were about to collapse and could not afford to repair them were given repair costs and divided more floating property. There were a total of 10 households. (3) Party member Yang Zhankui and anti-Japanese Zhao Nuoshan (mistakenly identified as party members last time) both withdrew from the over-occupied houses; party members Jin Shuangsuo and Jin Caiyuan offered their own houses. (4) Anti-Japanese families have a special feeling in the distribution of houses and floating property, "Others are also anti-Japanese families, and I am also an anti-Japanese family. Others can exchange houses, why can't I exchange houses?" For example, anti-Japanese Li Xiaotang, who got a house last year, exchanged for a house again this time and wanted floating property, giving many reasons and making a lot of noise. But in order to take care of them, the Farmers' Representative Conference still appropriately satisfied their requirements, and the leadership promptly educated the bias of special feelings. Farmers have a habit of settling down in the distribution of houses, and they are unwilling to go to places where they are not familiar with people, and they are unwilling to go to houses that are far from where they live now. These habits are not easy to break at once. Consideration should also be given when distributing and exchanging houses.

　　Floating Property Distribution Method: Classify Grades According to Specific Circumstances, Determine Standard People, and Then Fill In

　　(3) Distribution of floating property: Since the struggle in the summer and autumn of last year, the fruits have not been distributed, so a lot of floating property has been saved. The floating property includes clothes, rags, cotton, utensils, trees, grain, cash, stocks, etc., totaling 23.5 million yuan.

　　First, the method of determining the grade: First, according to the existence, quantity, quality, and condition of land, houses, and floating property, they are divided into three grades and nine levels. Then, the conditions of the loophole households are put forward and included in the grade. Three people are drawn from each level and an investigation is conducted at the mass meeting to determine the amount needed to be filled, and then the money is uniformly converted into shares and drawn into a table. The horizontal is the population, and the vertical is the grade. In the same grade, the number of shares increases or decreases according to the number of people. In the nine levels with the same population, there is also an increasing or decreasing. In this way, each person in the loophole household is compared with the standard person of the same level, and what should be added is added, and what should be reduced is reduced.

　　Second, the principle of fruit distribution: The main purpose of this fruit distribution is to fill the loopholes, so the principles are: (1) First fill the big loopholes, and fill the small loopholes if they should be filled, and don't fill them if they can't be filled. (2) Special care should be given to the lonely, widowed, elderly, and weak in the distribution of floating property. (3) Those who have been supplemented with houses and land, but the houses are bad and cannot be repaired, should be supplemented with floating property. (4) Those who have been supplemented with good houses and good land should be appropriately reduced in the distribution of floating property. (5) The requirements of the poor and hired peasants must be satisfied in the distribution of floating property, and the wrongly-struggled households should be filled in as much as possible so that they can have food and use. (6) The distribution of floating property should be as wide as possible.

　　Third, the result of the first assessment of floating property distribution: A total of 253 households were graded in the first assessment of floating property distribution, and the number of people who distributed floating property was 700, accounting for one-third of the total population of the village. The highest of the loophole households mostly belonged to wrongly-struggled middle peasants. The highest average number, Jin Gengqiu, gave up all the land, and one person was divided into 150,000 yuan. The lowest, the third grade and the ninth level, had an average of 5,000 yuan per person. After the assessment, the list was posted for the masses to make suggestions. After the masses looked at the list, they discussed it. After review: (1) The distribution of floating property was not wide enough. There were no names of middle peasants and anti-Japanese families, and the middle peasants and anti-Japanese families were dissatisfied. (2) There were omissions of really difficult people, and the representativeness of the farmers' representatives was not strong. (3) The representatives were divorced from the masses, did not discuss with the masses, and did not decide after the masses discussed it first. They simply asked each family what difficulties they had, so what should be raised was not raised, but what should not be raised was obtained. (4) A few new cadres had more, causing the whole village to compare with them. The masses who did not get the fruits did not even open the meeting. "If the things can't be distributed, what's the point of opening the wife and nephew's meeting?" "Let's not raise this, it's useless to pull it up, let others raise it!" Anti-Japanese families and some particularly dissatisfied people said: "It's good to be an official if you have someone in the court, and the new cadres are worse than the old cadres." The leadership carefully studied the reactions of the masses, accepted the correct opinions of the masses, and also made appropriate criticisms of the incorrect opinions.

　　Fourth, after accepting the opinions of the masses, strengthening the contact between the representatives and the masses, combining the actual requirements of the masses, and carefully grasping the principles of floating property distribution, the first revision of floating property distribution was made, making the particularly high ones lower, and the low ones higher. Combining the requirements raised by each household in the poor farmers' associations in each street, the omitted loophole households were supplemented, and the anti-Japanese middle peasants and other households who did not get the fruits were also given a very small share on average. As a result of the assessment, 322 households occupied the grade, and the other 327 households were given an average of 4,000 yuan of fruits per household (residents in the mountains were not counted, and there were things to divide in the mountains). In this way, the whole village became a fruit distribution household. The highest average number was still Jin Gengqiu. In addition to 80,000 yuan of floating property, the stock market stock ticket was also supplemented. Many wrongly-struggled middle peasants divided floating property of more than 200,000 yuan per household. The lowest grade had an average of 2,000 yuan per person. After the second revision, it was read repeatedly three times, carefully revised and passed by the representatives of the Farmers' Representative Conference, and then posted a notice to the masses. After this list was posted, the wrongly-struggled middle peasants and poor peasants got a lot of fruits, and the middle peasants were very happy. "Let's not talk about how much things we get, it's enough to have a name." "Let's not talk about all the middle peasants, let's ask everyone to want 1,000 yuan less, and celebrate our work completion in a singing stage show!" In short, everyone was very satisfied with the second list.

　　New Cadres Do Not Separate From the Masses, and Pay Attention to Unite With Middle Peasants at Any Time

　　Fifth, a few experiences in floating property distribution: (1) In work, it is necessary to grasp the policy of uniting with middle peasants at all times. If you are not careful, it is easy to cause very bad results. In the first floating property distribution list in Zhao Village, there was no share for middle peasants. A few middle peasants reflected dissatisfaction. "In the end, are we fruit-getting households? Or are we struggled households? We gave up the land, but there is not even a name on the fruit list." "No matter how much, there is not even a name." So they were unwilling to open the meeting, there were a lot of opinions, and it had a great impact on the work. (2) Divorced from the masses, they will lose the fair and reasonable standard. In the first assessment of floating property, the representatives were divorced from the masses, and only the opinions of a few representatives determined whether it should be supplemented or not. As a result, not only did the representatives not criticize and correct unreasonable demands, but they also made serious small group factionalism. Because of this, reasonable democratic system and fair judgment became impossible. (3) The masses have the ability to supervise the representatives. For example, the new cadre Fang Shuangze got a higher share of fruits, and the masses made a lot of suggestions. "Let's compare with Fang Shuangze!" So the new cadres are vigilant themselves. "After we finish it, let's review the fruits of the cadres separately, so as not to make the masses reflect." However, on the other hand, there was a tendency of extreme democracy. Unreasonable demands were asked the representatives to raise, and if they couldn't raise them, they would scold the representatives, making the representatives feel that things were difficult to handle. This point should be corrected immediately in the work, and the democratic system and democratic discipline should be determined. (4) There is absolute egalitarianism among the farmers. It is most obvious in the land exchange. If one family cannot exchange the land, they will propose "Either everyone should not exchange it, or everyone should exchange it." This tendency that I don't have it and you can't have it should also be paid attention to and corrected.

### 满足贫雇要求巩固团结中农　赵庄完成抽补工作

　　满足贫雇要求巩固团结中农
  　赵庄完成抽补工作
    除去中农土地人口
  　牵动面就不会过大
    赵庄抽补工作至本月十三日顺利完成。因为抽补前经过充分的准备阶段，群众中酝酿抽补，再划阶级，以及丈地评产量运动，都紧密的和抽补结合起来。长期的教育启发后，群众觉悟已大大提高。在抽补中对于满足贫雇农要求，紧密团结中农，改正错斗户成份的方针，群众思想上已经成熟，都能很好的掌握，抽补进行的十分迅速。
    （一）抽补土地：第一、赵庄土地概况：赵庄原有人数共二○九九人，土地八一九八·二亩，产量七六四七·八五石，每人平均亩数三·九一亩，平均产量三·六四石（根据原有地亩和人口）。经过丈地评产量以后，人口增加至二一五七口（有新下户，新回来户及新生的小孩），土地七八七○·七亩，产量则为五三四一·○七石，平均每人土地三·六四九亩，产量二·四七六石。
    第二、计算全村平均产量及补地户应补产量问题：经过研究，如果以全村人口除全村土地得出的平均数作抽补根据，则应补户需补产量必大，必犯打乱平分，绝对平均，动中农的错误。所以，赵庄首先把中农土地和人口由全村土地人口中除去，其他人口平均其余土地所得之平均数，为抽补产量的根据。这样，所得数字为每人平均三·四八三亩，产量为二·四一八石。因为要照顾一口两口人的户，按两石三斗进行抽补，全村补地户共一四九户，五三七人，应补土地七二八·一一二亩，产量五二二·二六石。
    中农自动献地　完全出自心愿
    第三、抽地对象和献地情况：按平均产量，抽出党员抗属多占地和新翻身户过高者共一一二户，产量三七四·七九石，中农自动出地，献出产量一四六·七八石，抽献土地共产量五二一·五七石，公地（包括绝户地）收回七三·一五亩，产量三九·四二石。以上总共产量五六○·九九石。中农献地时特别强调自愿原则，在他们献地时，工作组同志和农会委员再三的申明不动中农的政策，说明如愿拿出土地帮助贫雇弟兄翻身时，必须完全出自心愿，而且不能献过自己应有产量。虽然这样，中农中献地的还是很多。如赵顺喜，比应有产量多四石多，恐怕群众说他不开明，坐卧不安。工作同志看出他的心意，又再三申述政策，说不献也可，完全自愿，最后他说：“那咱就还是种着，群众反映可不少！”这样反复了几次，最后土地还是他“自己种着”了。
    第四、抽补土地原则：农代会决议，抽时一口人留两口人的产量，两口留三口的，多十分之一不抽。补地时，因抽出产量不够分配，所以按实际人口补地，一人补一人的，酌量多照顾一点，两口的就补两人产量，三口以上的少十分之一不补。贫雇农种坏地太多者，按实际情况经农代会通过可换好地近地。此外，劳力不足或其他原因申明不必补足产量者不强补足。
    第五、抽补中人口问题：退伍军人孟挪子在抽补前一天，冒大雨由武安城买了一个小孩回来，准备分地。其他养子女也都因分土地而发生了纠纷，有的要求独立门户，有的为小孩起了争执。农代会为了防止投机取巧，定了几条规矩：一、土地法公布以后分家者不算。二、以前虽然分家，实际上仍在一块过活的，仍以未分家处理。三、在外三年，没有音信的不算。四、父死母嫁，母有权带养子女，分田可随他母亲现在家庭。五、在外独身之革命军人，同样分地分房屋，但在他未回来以前，土地房屋都可暂借别人使用。六、有儿子的光棍寡妇，虽和儿子分家，但不和一般无儿子的一律看待。七、分地期间（即各种新机构成立以后）生的孩子顶一口，投机买的孩子不顶口。
    专人负责评定　民主讨论修正
    第六、补地方法：由专门人员负责，计算填补拼凑土地，把补地户现有土地按产量分成四个等级，计算需补各等产量数目，然后用同样方法，计算出抽献土地中各等地产量数目（八斗以上是头等，六至八斗二等，四至五斗三等，四斗以下四等），然后将各等地分别加起来，用应补地人口分别除开，得出每人应得各等地亩数多少后，就进行填补，坏地多者填补头二等地，好地多者填补三四等地。产量每人补足二·三石，好坏地每家都得到适当调剂（大约头等七分，二等一亩，三等一亩半，四等补齐）。补完后贴榜由群众提意见修改，农代会修正通过，再榜定案。
    第七、补换土地结果：除补足需补户产量以外，有些人不愿要地，就另加浮财使之满足。贫雇和新中农中换地的共二十三户。换进好地，退出坏地的结果，连同补地所余土地，共剩下七八·六六亩，产量三五·八二石。这些剩余土地贴榜借给农民耕种。总之，在抽补后，除极少数不愿要地者外，其他每人都补足二·三石。被错斗的中农中，在过去土地产量脱数甚多者，这次也补足了。如赵长山，未被错斗以前，五口人只十亩地，靳树业四口人三四亩坏地，赵有山四口人只五亩地，这次均补足了产量。中农献出土地后，仍较一般为高，每人平均二·六二八石。
    第八、抽补中的几个问题：（一）抽补以前，必须把中农土地除去，得到全村其他人口除其余土地之平均产量，按照这个平均数字进行抽补，这样得出平均产量比较合理，因为中农虽然不动，或动的很少，就不能把中农过多的产量加进去平均。（二）抽补时一口留两口，两口留三口人的产量，算全村（中农除外）平均数字时，应把一口留两口的虚人口计算进去，抽补将更实际，赵庄这一点未能即时计入，如果计入虚人口时，可完成补地时，一口按二口、二口按三口填补。（三）在补地所需产量不够分配时，应该报告群众，由群众自己讨论解决，但是必须防止群众中左倾情绪。在赵庄第一次宣布需补产量不够数时，农民中有这样的发言：“中农不动，土地多了就不是中农，多的应该拿出来”；“我看这个产量还在中农手里哩”；“要是中农不动，咱贫雇摊出来吧，摊出来后再给中农当长工！”这些话虽为大多数群众纠正，但是农民中的平均主义、左倾情绪随时爆发，必须特别加以注意，并即时给以启发教育。（四）在抽地时没有详细计算应抽户每亩的平均产量，因此应抽户被抽后的土地质量仍比应补户高。（五）军干烈属土地在质量上应高一点（计算时也要计算在内），因为军干烈属土地仍须一般农民代耕，多误了工仍是一般农民吃亏。这次的换地户，大部分是去年参军的新抗属。
    村里房子不够抽补　适当发给修理费用
    （二）分房问题：赵庄房屋最感困难，农代会规定：（一）两辈人以上在一屋住的，可以补房子或换房子。（二）人口多，房屋太窄狭的，可以补换房屋。（三）房子快倒塌不能住的可换房子，或补给浮财修补。全村提出换房子，或修补房子的很多；但因房子缺少，结果只有以下户数补换了房子：错斗中农有一九户回到自己原来的房子，共五三间；换房子的二五户，共补出房子五间；抗属十家换了好房子，补了十七间；贫雇农换房子的六四户，补房子一○五间，换房子六五间，农会原存房子共三九○间，这次补换出去三三○间，所余六○间村政府和学校占着五六间。所以：（一）在房子问题上也是尽量满足了贫雇农的要求；同时，又填补了错斗中农的房子，并且使他们满意了。（二）要求修补房子的，因为换了的很多，又因实际修起来户数太多，所以，只好遵照农代会规定，房子快倒塌不能住，又自己无力修补的，才补给修补费，多分点浮财，这种户共有十户。（三）党员杨占魁，抗属赵挪山（上次误为党员）都退出多占房子；党员靳双锁和靳财元则献出，自己房子。（四）在分房子和浮财中抗属都有特殊感，“人家也是抗属，我也是抗属，人家能换房子，我为什么不能换？”如抗属李小堂，去年就得了房子，这次又换了房子又要浮财，提出许多理由，大吵大闹。但为了照顾他们，农代会还是适当的满足了他们的要求，领导上则及时的对特殊感的偏向作了教育。分配房子上农民有定居的习惯，人情不熟的地方不愿去，分的房子离现在住处远了也不愿去，这些习惯一时很不容易打破。分房换房时也应予以照顾。
    浮财分配办法　依具体情况划分等级　定出标准人然后填补
    （三）分浮财：自去年夏秋斗争以后，果实就未分配，所以浮财存得很多。浮财中包括衣服、碎布、棉花、用具、树木、粮食、现款、股票等项，总共折价二千三百五十万元。
    一、定等级的办法：先依土地、房屋、浮财的有无、多少、好坏分成三等九级，然后提出窟窿户条件，归入等级，在每级中抽出三人，在群众会上进行调查所需填补数量，然后统一按钱折成份数，画成表格，横为人口，竖为等级，在同级中人口多少份数上有累进递减，在同人口的九级中也有累进递减。这样把窟窿户中每一个人都比着同级的标准人，该添的就添，该减则减。
    二、分果实原则：这次分果实，主要在填窟窿，所以原则上是：（一）先填大窟窿，小窟窿该填则填，不能填的不填。（二）孤寡老弱，在浮财上特别照顾。（三）补了房地，房屋坏无力修补者，补浮财。（四）补了好房好地的，在浮财上酌量减少。（五）贫雇要求必须在浮财上给以满足，错斗户则尽量填补，使能有吃有用。（六）分浮财面尽量宽些。
    三、第一次评定分浮财结果：第一次分浮财的评定，共二百五十三户有等级，分浮财人数为七百，占全村人口三分之一。窟窿户最高者多属错斗中农。平均数最高的靳更秋把土地都献出，一口人分十五万元。最低的三等九级中，有一人平均五千元者。评定后，贴榜让群众提意见，群众看榜后议论纷纷，经过检讨：（一）分浮财面不宽，中农抗属都无名字，中农抗属不满。（二）真正困难者有漏户，农民代表的代表性不强。（三）代表们脱离了群众，不和群众讨论，不由群众先讨论决定，然后再提上大会，都是单纯的问每家有何困难，所以该提的提不上去，不该提的却有的得了份数。（四）代表中严重的发生了片片主义，能说会道的占了上风，老实不会讲话的，理由说不清说不完被顶回去，结果当然不公。（五）几个新干部分的较多了些，造成全村的人和他们比较。群众中未得到果实的，连会也不开了，“东西分不到，还开啥妻侄会哩”，“咱这个提不提吧，拉上去也不办事，叫人家提吧！”抗属和一部分特别不满意的人则说：“朝里有人好坐官，新干部比旧干部还恶哩。”领导上仔细的研究了群众的反映，接受了群众的正确意见，对不正确意见也进行了适当的批评。
    四、接受群众意见，加强代表和群众联系，结合群众实际要求，小心掌握分浮财原则以后，又作第一次分浮财的修正，使特别高的去掉些，低的加高些，结合在各街贫农团会各户自己所提的要求，补进漏掉的窟窿户，并且另外把抗属中农和其他未得果实户，也都每家平均分给很少一份。评定结果，三百二十二户占了等级，其他三百二十七户，平均每家分给四千元果实（山上居民未计入，在山上有东西可分）。这样，全村都变成了分果实户了。最高平均数仍为靳更秋，除八万元浮财外，另外还补给市坊股金票。错斗中农每家分浮财在二十万以上者很多。最低的等级份则平均每人二千元。第二次修正后，又反复宣读三次，经农代会代表仔细修正通过，再榜布告群众。这次榜挂出后，错斗中农、贫雇农都得到了很多果实，中农都很欢喜，“咱不说得多少东西，有个名就行。”“咱不能把中农都谈谈，每人少要一千元，唱台戏，庆贺咱工作完成！”总之，大家对于第二次榜都很满意。
    新干部不脱离群众　随时注意团结中农
    五、分浮财中的几点体验：（一）工作中必须时时掌握团结中农政策，稍不留意，就容易造成很坏结果。赵庄第一次分浮财榜中，没有中农的份儿，有几个中农反映不满，“到底咱是得果实户？还是被斗户？献了地果实单上连个名字都没有”。“多少不说，连个名也没有”。所以会也不愿开了，意见很多，影响工作很大。（二）脱离群众，就会失掉公平合理的标尺。在第一次评定浮财中，代表脱离了群众，只是几个代表的意见，就决定了应补与否的问题。结果，代表中彼此不但不加批评纠正不合理要求，反而闹成了严重的片片主义。因为这样，所以就使合理的民主制度，公平的判断都成为不可能了。（三）群众中有了监督代表的能力了，如新干部房双则得果实较高，群众提意见就提得很多，“咱和房双则比比吧”！所以新干部都警惕自己了，“咱弄完了，再把干部的果实单独阅虑一遍，免叫群众反映”。但是，在另一面则出现了极端民主的倾向，不合理的要求要代表去提，提不上去就骂代表，使代表很感事情难办。这一点，在工作中应该即时予以纠正，应确定民主制度和民主纪律。（四）农民中有绝对平均主义，在换地中表现得最明显，有一家地换不成了，就提出“要不大家都不要换了，要换大家都换”。这种我没有你也不能有的倾向，也须注意纠正。
