Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th—After the People's Liberation Army surrounded Luochuan city, in order to encourage the enemy troops to wake up as soon as possible and avoid unnecessary sacrifices, it launched a political offensive including battlefield appeals. The Political Department of the Frontline Command printed "A Letter to the Officers and Soldiers Defending Luochuan," and General Zhao Shoushan also sent a personal letter to Yang YinHuan, the commander of the enemy defending the city, advising them to repent and stage an uprising or lay down their weapons, and not to make unnecessary sacrifices for the Chiang Hu bandit gang. Our besieging troops universally established battlefield appeal groups, and every dusk, braving the flying spring snow, they shouted at the enemy on the opposing positions. As a result, enemy officers spread the saying: "First they fear shells, second they fear fire, third they fear the Liberation Army's appeals." On the night of March 22nd, after launching appeals towards the enemy's outer stronghold of Shijiazhuang blockhouse south of the city, we launched an attack. Although the enemy sentry soldiers discovered our troops moving forward, they did not make a sound, but automatically laid down their weapons when our army arrived. Thirty soldiers of the first platoon of the fourth company of the 182nd regiment of the Chiang army's 61st Brigade, led by squad leader Song Deming, also surrendered with their weapons. The next day, the enemy defending the mother blockhouse of the western blockhouse group in Shijiazhuang, consisting of the machine gun company of the second battalion and part of the fourth company of the 182nd regiment, a total of 64 people, surrendered to us under the suppression of our superior firepower and battlefield appeals, carrying seven light and heavy machine guns, seventeen rifles, 8,500 rounds of ammunition, seven boxes of American-made grenades, and a portion of other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 11th—After the New-Type Military Consolidation Movement, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army displayed a new atmosphere during the Great Advance. A certain squad helped the sick during the march, so no one fell behind, and the entire squad reviewed their merits after camping. A certain soldier who used to be known as a "chronic invalid" was in high spirits during this march, and once carried five guns for his comrades. Many company-level cadres also helped physically weak soldiers carry their luggage, and battalion and regimental cadres often walked themselves, giving their horses to the sick. The units also universally established discipline duty officers and civilian affairs propaganda groups, wearing armbands and rotating responsibilities, so everyone had a very strong sense of responsibility, and mass discipline was greatly improved. Bai Fusheng, the squad leader of the ninth company, accidentally broke a landlord's tile pot due to illness, and the soldier Wang Wenfu immediately took out his own allowance to compensate. The soldiers of the company not only did not trample on the seedlings themselves, but also automatically passed the word to the follow-up troops on the march: "Everyone pay attention, do not trample on the seedlings."

　　洛川我军进行战场喊话
  　蒋军纷纷携械投诚
    【新华社西北十一日电】解放军将洛川城包围后，为促敌军早日醒悟免遭无谓牺牲，即展开喊话等政治攻势。前线司令部政治部印发“告洛川守敌官兵书”，赵寿山将军并亲函敌守城指挥官杨荫寰，劝告他们翻然悔悟，举行起义或放下武器，不要再替蒋胡匪作无谓牺牲。我围城部队普遍成立喊话组，每天黄昏即冒着纷飞的春雪，在对峙的阵地上向敌喊话，敌军官中因此流传说：“一怕炮弹，二怕火，三怕解放军喊话”。三月二十二日夜我向城南敌外围据点石家庄碉堡进行喊话后发动攻击，敌前哨士兵虽发现我部队向前运动，但不声张，却趁我军到达时自动放下了武器。据守碉堡的蒋军六十一旅一八二团四连一排三十名士兵也在班长宋德明率领下携械投诚。次日石家庄西碉堡群母碉守敌一八二团第二营机枪连及第四连一部共六十四人，在我优势火力压制与战场喊话下，携轻重机枪七挺，步枪十七支，子弹八千五百发，美造手榴弹七箱及其他军用品一部向我投诚。
    【新华社晋绥十一日电】解放军某部经新式整军运动后，在大进军途中显示一片新气象。某班在行军中帮助病号，因此无一掉队，宿营后全班查功。某战士过去有“老病号”之称，这次行军中精神振作，一次曾替战友背了五支枪。许多连级干部也帮助体弱战士背行李，营团干部经常自己走路，把马让给病号。该部各单位并普遍成立纪律值班员和民运宣传组，佩带袖章，轮流转交，大家工作责任心极强，群众纪律因此大大进步。九连班长白富生因病不慎打破房东瓦盆，战士王文富立即拿出自己的津贴赔偿。该连战士不仅自己不踩青苗，且在行军途中自动向后续部队传话：“大家注意，不要踩青苗”。
