　　Snippets from Cities in the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas
    ▲In Shanghai, the poor are living in dire conditions, and deaths are extremely high. In the first three months and eight days of this year alone, the Tongshan Hall, a local charity, collected and buried as many as 7,738 corpses from the streets.
    ▲In Tianjin, intellectuals are suffering from a severe unemployment panic. Recently, 40 to 50 people have been going to a certain organ of the Chiang bandit's Ministry of Social Affairs in Tianjin every day to seek employment. Many people with specialized skills are seeking jobs with a monthly salary of 50 to 60 catties of white flour, but cannot find them.
    ▲In Peiping, news professionals are suffering immensely due to soaring prices. Last month, they collectively elected Zhang Henshui and others as representatives to demand that the Chiang bandits allocate one bag of flour per person per month.
    ▲In Peiping, a beggar went to a gold shop on the first alley of Qianmenwai Langfang to beg. The shop gave him 100 yuan in Chiang currency, but the beggar refused to accept it, asking for a piece of waste newspaper instead.
    ▲In Peiping, toilet paper in public restrooms costs 2,000 yuan in Chiang currency each time. People say, "It's better to use 'legal tender' as toilet paper."
