    Eliminating Controls to Facilitate Production:
    Editor Comrade:
    Currently, some areas lack leading cadres, and work has not been fully initiated. However, some existing issues cannot be continuously postponed. For instance, some individuals who were wrongly targeted during struggles in previous years are still under control. Cadres and poor and hired peasants are aware that they were struggling against their own people, but they are unable to rectify the situation. In some mutual aid teams, the equivalence of labor value between middle and poor peasants is unfair, leading to different treatment of middle peasants, causing ideological divisions between middle and poor peasants. Delaying these issues will affect production. My opinion is that temporary solutions should be implemented. Is this appropriate?
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Li Cheng Shiban, Wang Taiqi

Taiqi Comrade:
    Your suggestion to provide temporary solutions for those who were wrongly targeted is correct. We believe that if it is confirmed that individuals were wrongly targeted and are still under control, affecting production, then it is necessary to promptly lift the controls and temporarily address their urgent needs and difficulties in production to facilitate spring plowing. Even for landlords and rich peasants who were not wrongly targeted, they should be urged to engage in production, and some formal controls (such as wearing signs) are unnecessary. However, it must be recognized that correcting wrongful targeting is a cautious and meticulous task. A comprehensive resolution must be reserved for the formal land reform and party rectification process. The current measures should only be temporary and not involve too broad a scope. The handling of these issues should be researched by the leadership and not be carried out rashly.
    In addition, unfair phenomena in mutual aid teams should be corrected immediately. Whether middle or poor peasants, fairness and equal value must be ensured within the mutual aid teams. Unilaterally favoring poor and hired peasants by suppressing the wages of middle peasants is incorrect and must be rectified through educating the masses.

    Regarding Land Distribution for Primary School Teachers and Infant Care Issues
    Reply to Letters from Comrades Chai Renping, Ren Qingyu, et al.
    During land reform, primary school teachers should be allocated the same amount of land as peasants. This is clearly stipulated in Article 10, Section B of the Land Law Outline: Ordinary rural workers, self-employed individuals, and their families should be allocated the same amount of land as peasants. However, if their occupation is sufficient to cover all or most of their living expenses, they should not be allocated land, or only a portion of land should be allocated, as determined by the rural peasant congress and its committee. Primary school teachers are self-employed individuals, but their salaries are generally only sufficient to cover personal living expenses. Therefore, those whose families are in rural areas can have land allocated to themselves and their families. If there is a shortage of land in some areas, or if their families lack labor, adjustments can be made according to the circumstances, but it must ensure that they can maintain their family life and concentrate on their work.
    Regarding the issue of infant care for female primary school teachers, according to two interpretations of the Border Region Government's Provisional Measures for Infant Care, it is pointed out that female teachers in senior and junior primary schools in various areas, if their families are not in the liberated areas, or are in the liberated areas but are far away and have no economic connection, and their salaries are only sufficient to cover personal living expenses, can be exempted from Article 5 of the measures and provided with care according to Article 2: From birth to two years of age, a monthly milk and food allowance of 40 jin of millet will be provided; from two to four years of age, 50 jin; from four to seven years of age, 70 jin. For infants of all ages, 100 square feet of clothing cloth and 2 jin of cotton will be provided annually. School-age children over seven years old will be treated as public-funded students.

    The Spirit of the Songjiazhuang News is Correct, But Some Facts Are Inaccurate
    Editor Comrade:
    I saw the report on the work in Songjiazhuang published on page one of the March 27th newspaper, which does not correspond to some of the circumstances at the time.
    The branch committee secretary at that time was not me, but Tian Zixi. I arrived in Songjiazhuang in August 1946. When I arrived, Zhang Zhuzhen had already committed suicide (he should not have died). The reason for his death was that he took too many fruits, and the masses asked him to make a confession, which he could not do. At that time, in order to correct the phenomenon of cadres taking too many fruits, we asked the masses to offer their opinions, supervise the cadres, and replace several of them. On the other hand, we guided the masses to shift towards struggling against landlords. He said that two people were tied up, but in reality, only one person was tied up, whose surname was Ji, and I can't remember his first name. He advocated beating Sun Zicheng to death and verbally abused the old district cadres. At that time, the masses did not advocate beating Sun Zicheng to death, so he was tied up. After he was tied up, we personally explained the situation to him, and it was not that the leading cadres were against the masses.
    Was this a suppression of the masses? We reviewed at the time and believed that it would have an impact, so I publicly told the masses that tying people up was wrong.
    The spirit of this report is good, reflecting the emotions of the masses. It is good to promote democracy and settle historical wrongs. However, we must report the facts carefully and not distort them to make up materials. I did a bad job in the village, but to say that I am a leading cadre against the masses is putting too big a hat on me.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Ma Xiaoshan)

Xiaoshan Comrade:
    Your letter says that the report by Comrades Guo Yuan et al. on Songjiazhuang (page one of the March 27th issue) is correct in spirit and reflects the emotions of the masses, but the details are somewhat inaccurate. Comrade Guo Yuan et al. should pay attention to this, and in the future, when writing articles, the details should also be clarified.

　　编读往来
    取消管制便利生产编辑同志：
    现在有些地方没有领导干部，工作没有展开，但目前有些问题不能一直放着，如：有些斗争对象是在前年斗错了的，现在仍受管制，干部和贫雇也知道是斗了自己人，但无法纠正。互助组里有些地方中贫农等价不公道，对中农有不同的对待，使中贫农思想上有了隔阂。这些问题搁着会影响生产的，我的意见应作暂时解决，是否对呢？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　黎城石板　王太岐太岐同志：
    你提出有些错斗了的，应作暂时解决，这意见是正确的。我们认为如确知是错斗了的，现在仍受着管制，影响生产，那是应该肯定迅速取消管制，并暂时解决其生产中的一些迫切要求与困难，以利春耕。即便是没斗错的地主富农，也应督促其从事生产，一些形式上（如挂牌等）的管制也没必要。但必须认识，纠正错斗是一件慎重而细致的工作，全盘问题必须留到正式进行土改整党中慎重解决，当前这些措施，只能是暂时的，不要牵动太广。这些问题的处理，都要经过领导研究，不能草率从事。
    另外，互助组中不公道的现象，应立即纠正，不管中贫农，在互助组里一定要做到公平等价。片面的照顾贫雇压低中农工资是不正确的，必须教育群众纠正。

    关于小学教员分地及婴儿保育问题
    答柴任平、任庆余等同志来信
    在土地改革中，小学教员应与农民分得同样一份土地。这一点土地法大纲第十条乙项规定得很清楚：一般的乡村工人，自由职业者及其家庭，分给与农民同样的土地。但其职业足以经常维持生活费用之全部或大部者，不分土地，或分给部分土地，由乡村农民大会及其委员会酌量处理。小学教员是自由职业者，但现在他们的薪金一般仅足维持个人生活，所以家在乡村的，其本人及家庭都可分地。如果有的地方土地少，或者其家庭缺乏劳力，可以斟酌情况，变通处理，但总要使其能维持家庭生活，好安心工作。
    小学女教员婴儿保育问题，根据边府对于执行边区婴儿保育暂行办法的两项解释，指出各地高、初小女教员，如家非在解放区，或虽在解放区而距离遥远、断绝经济联系，平时薪金规定亦仅足维持个人生活，经审查属实者，可以不援用该办法第五条之规定，而按该办法第二条予以保育，即：婴儿初生至二周岁，月发乳食费小米四十斤，二周岁以上至四周岁五十斤，四周岁以上至七周岁七十斤，以上各岁之婴儿，都是全年发给被服布一百平方尺，棉花二斤。七周岁以上之学龄儿童按公费生待遇。　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    宋家庄消息精神是对的　只是有些事实有出入编辑同志：
    我看到三月二十七号报纸一版所登的宋家庄工作，与当时有些情况不符合。
    当时分委书记不是我，是田子熙，我是在四六年八月到的宋家庄。一到该村张竹真已经自杀（他是不该死的），死的原因是由于多占果实，群众让他做交代交不下来。我们当时为了纠正干部多占果实现象，让群众提意见，监督干部，并撤换了几个。另一方面引导群众向斗地主方面转移。他说捆起两个，实际是捆起一个，姓冀，说不清叫什么名字啦。他主张打死孙自成，漫骂旧区干部，当时群众并不主张打死孙自成的，困此捆起他。捆起来以后，我们亲自又给本人做了解释，并不是领导干部反群众的。
    这样做了是不是对群众一个镇压呢？我们当时的检讨，认为是会受影响的，所以我公开向群众谈过捆人是不对的。
    这篇通讯的精神是好的，是反映群众情绪的，发扬民主、清算历史上的坏处是好的。但自己必须要认真报导，不要为凑材料歪曲事实。我对该村工作做得是不好的，不过象这样就说我是领导干部反群众，就有些帽子太大。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（马小山）小山同志：
    你来信说宋家庄国元等同志报导（上月二十七号一版）精神是对的，是反映群众情绪的，只是细节上与当时情况有些出入，这一点希国元等同志注意些，以后写稿，在细节上也应弄清楚。
