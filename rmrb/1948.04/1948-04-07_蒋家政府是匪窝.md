The Chiang Kai-shek Government is a Den of Bandits

"If you don't pay ransom, you are a 'political prisoner'"

Last July, the pseudo-Fengxiang County government issued a "secret order" to the township chiefs, ordering them to secretly report seven "political suspects" within a limited time. All 170 town and township chiefs in the county chuckled when they saw this and said, "The county magistrate is out of money." So, they took this opportunity to report those who were not in their good graces as "political suspects." Within two days, a large number of ordinary people were arrested. Those whose families could afford to pay were ransomed back at the time; those who had no money were "political prisoners" and sat in jail. A farmer named Luo Jian was swindled out of 50 million yuan of Chiang currency before he was released. The bandit county magistrate made a fortune. It is said that he sent a pistol team to escort two large carts of money and property to his home.

"To get out of the 'drug rehabilitation center,' quickly send wheat"

The pseudo-Fengxiang County government also had a "get rich" order. Regardless of whether there were opium smokers in each township, each bao (group of households) was required to send four opium addicts to the "drug rehabilitation center" for three months. However, some bao had no opium smokers at all, and some bao, although there were smokers, were rich and powerful people whom no one dared to touch. The bao chiefs had no choice but to pool money to hire people to go to "rehabilitation." Regardless of whether they were addicted or not, after arriving at the "rehabilitation center," they not only had to do hard labor all day long but also went hungry every day. Unable to bear it, many people asked to go home after a few days. The director said, "You can go home, but you must pay for three months of meals - 1.2 dou of wheat." So, the "addicts" left the center one by one, and bags of wheat entered the center.

"There are two treasures for getting rich: red hats and black hats."

Wang Chongbao, the bandit magistrate of Liquan County, summoned the bao deputy of Jianling Township in March last year. During the conversation, he pulled out a pistol from his waist and threatened, "The superior has ordered that you have dealings with northern Shaanxi, and I am ordered to detain you immediately." Seeing the situation was bad, the bao deputy quickly begged for "leniency," but it was no use. But when "money" was mentioned, the county magistrate immediately smiled and said, "As long as you are willing to take out 50 million yuan, I guarantee I won't detain you." Chen Weiqi, from the northern township of the county, was also summoned by Wang Chongbao one day, and during the conversation, he was given a "black hat" (i.e., opium trafficking) and extorted 70 million yuan. The villagers satirized, "Magistrate Wang has two treasures for getting rich, using red hats and black hats. No matter who wears them, no one can stand it."

"Testing teachers want wheat"

Last summer, Guo Yi, the pseudo-Fengxiang County Education Section Chief, when testing and assigning senior elementary school teachers in the county, he arranged a list in advance based on the different positions of principals, directors, and teachers, and the different economic situations of individuals, and wrote different amounts of wheat stones under each person's name, with three types: two stones, five stones, and ten stones, and pasted them on the wall of his house. What did this mean? One person explained on behalf of the section chief, "If you want to pass the teacher exam, you have to pay two stones of wheat; if you want to be a director through connections, you have to pay five stones; if you want to be a principal, you have to pay ten stones. If you don't pay wheat, you know what will happen." As a result, many teachers lost their jobs last year.

"The thief crying 'stop thief' exposed his true colors"

The Second Police Station in Wuliwan, Fengxiang, is actually a bandit den for robbery. The director, Liu Zhong, often sent people to rob people on the road. Once, after several porters were robbed, they ran to the police station to request a wanted order. Who knew that the people chasing them fired a few shots and then forced the porters to pay for the bullets. The porters could not afford the money and were forced to cry loudly. As time went on, this guy's true colors were exposed. Once during a robbery, the police uniform was exposed from under the plain clothes, and the people realized that this police agency was originally a bandit den. Many past "pursuits of bandits" turned out to be the robbers themselves crying "stop thief."

　　蒋家政府是匪窝
  “不花赎身钱，便是‘政治犯’”
    去年七月间，伪凤翔县政府给各乡镇长下了一道“密令”，限日内各自密报七名“政治嫌疑分子”。全县共一百七十名镇乡长，他们一看都窃笑着说：“县长没钱用了”。他们也就趁这机会把和自己心里不对的人，当做“政治嫌疑分子”，密报了上去，不出两天，就有大批老百姓被捕，家里能拿出钱的，当时赎了回去，没有钱的，就是“政治犯”，坐监牢。有一个名叫骆俭的农民，被诈了五千万元蒋币，才得出来。匪县长大发横财，据说他曾派了一个手枪队，给家里护送了票子和财物两大车。
    “要出‘戒烟所’，快送麦子来”
    伪凤翔县府还有一道“发财”命令，不问各乡有没有吸大烟的，限每保一律抽四个烟民到“戒烟所”住三个月。但是有的保根本没有吸大烟的，有些保虽有烟民，都是有钱有势的人，谁敢动他。弄得保长没办法，只得摊钱雇人去“戒烟”，不管有无烟瘾，到了“戒烟所”后，一天到晚做苦工还不说，天天饿肚子实在受不了，不几天，很多人要求回家。所长说：“回家可以，但要交清三个月的伙食，——麦子一石二斗”。于是“烟民”一个个出所了，麦子一袋袋进所了。
    “发财有两宝，红帽和黑帽”。
    匪醴泉县长王重宝，去年三月里，叫健陵乡的保队附去谈话，谈话当中，从腰中间拔出手枪威胁说：“上级有令说你和陕北有来往，叫我把你立即管押起来”。保队附见势不妙，连忙请求“恩宽”，也不顶事。但当提到“钱”时，县长马上笑容满面说：“只要你愿拿出五千万元，我保证不管押你”。该县北乡有个陈维启，一天也被王重宝叫去，谈说之间，便给戴了个“黑帽子”（即贩大烟），就勒索了七千万元。乡间老百姓都讽刺说：“王县长发财有两宝，用的红帽和黑帽，不管戴在谁头上，谁也受不了”。
    “测验教员要麦子”
    去夏伪凤翔县教育科长郭义，在测验配备全县高级小学教员时，他以校长主任教员不同职务，和个人不同的经济状况，事先就排列了一个名单，并在每人名字下边写着不同的麦子石数，有两石、五石、十石三种，贴在自己的房子墙上。啥意思呢？有一人代替科长解释说：“你要考上教员，就得出两石麦子；要想活动当主任，就得出五石；当校长就得出十石。要是不出麦子，你就自己知道。”因而不少教员去年就丢了饭碗。
    “贼喊捉贼露了马脚”
    凤翔五里湾的第二警察派出所，实际上是个抢劫的匪窝。所长刘忠常派人到大路上抢人，一次有几个脚户遭抢劫后，跑到警所要求通缉，那知追赶的人放了几枪，回来即向脚户逼着要子弹钱。脚户们拿不出钱，被逼得放声大哭。日子长了，这个家伙的马脚也就露出来了。一次在抢劫中，警察服装从便服下露出来，人民才识破了这个警察机关，原来是匪窝。过去许多次“追赶土匪”，原来是强盗自己喊捉贼。
