Xinhua News Agency, Jidong, 8th. With the active assistance of the democratic government, fishermen in Leting and Luannan along the western coast of the Bohai Sea have established fishermen's committees to vigorously develop fisheries. The Leting Fishermen's Committee owns dozens of fishing boats and over a hundred fishing nets. Recently, the government issued 65 million Border Region currency in fishery loans and 30,000 catties of corn. In addition to distributing funds to each fishing household for net repair and boat maintenance, the Fishermen's Committee also helped independent boat owners who employ workers. Dai Chunrong, an independent boat owner in Xixinzhuang, could not afford workers this year, so the committee allocated workers to solve his problem. Currently, all 39 independent fishing boats in the county have gone out to sea. According to statistics, fishing households under the leadership of the Fishermen's Committee have recently earned a total profit of 27.5 million yuan. Fishermen in more than ten villages along the coast of Luannan have also received large loans of grain from the government. All 180 fishing boats and more than 800 fishermen in the entire area have successively gone out to sea to begin fishing.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th. The Pixiwo Salt Field, a famous salt-producing area in the Liaodong Peninsula, fully commenced operations on March 1st after the ice thawed, with 2,800 workers starting to dry salt on the 滩. After 20 days of active construction before the start of operations, a total of three electric mills, one electric saw, and 73 electric water pumps were installed, and most of the equipment has been electrified. At the same time, the Salt Affairs Bureau vigorously assisted the commencement of operations of various privately-run salt 滩s, granting loans of more than 239,500 catties of grain, 6.16 million yuan in loans, and 62 sets of salt-drying materials. It is estimated that privately-run salt 滩s alone can produce 80,000 tons (1,000 catties per ton) within half a year.
