    Anfeng Corrects Wrongly Classified Components
    Boosting Mass Production Enthusiasm
    [Xiyang News] After the establishment of poor and hired peasant groups and the organization of new farmers' associations in Anfeng, Eighth District, everyone demanded a cautious approach to class division. In each poor peasant group meeting and farmers' association meeting, there were general complaints about the "three checks" policy of tracing three generations when classifying people. This error created negative consequences in thought, leading to serious waste and non-production. The arguments on this issue were quite intense. Middle peasant Guo Fengtong said, "During the 'three checks,' thirty out of sixty-four households in our village were classified as feudal, and we are afraid and don't produce properly." Mi Zhong said, "My father and I worked as herders and cattle boys, but I was classified as feudal during the 'three checks.'" Li Qianju said, "Since being classified as feudal, I don't want to live anymore. Besides not producing, I also wasted 1.2 *shi* of buckwheat." Everyone said that last year, under the leadership of District Chief Wang, the "three checks" detained seven households, twenty-four people, and ate from the communal pot for twenty days. Unable to distinguish who was feudal and who was one of their own, how could they produce? In total, three poor and hired peasant households were wrongly classified as feudal, and eleven middle peasant households were wrongly struggled against. Based on the demands of the masses, and with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, the work team carried out democratic class division, also using the "three postings and settlement" method to ensure that no one was wronged. The whole village classified five households as landlords. Middle peasants who were wrongly classified or struggled against during the "three checks" were all reclassified as peasants.

    Due to severe enemy attacks and two consecutive years of drought, the masses faced great difficulties with farm tools, food, and drink. At that time, nineteen households (seventy-one people, including two landlord households with eleven people) had no food. Only three households in the whole village had enough to eat until autumn, and the majority could only eat until March or April. Everyone reflected that it was very difficult to work hard in spring plowing production without enough to eat. The work team recognized the severity of the famine. If appropriate solutions were not found, it would have a significant impact on democratic replenishment of spring plowing production. After discussions in the farmers' association, everyone unanimously recognized that, "In addition to the government loan of 250,000 yuan to solve the difficulties with farm tools and textiles, we must solve the biggest difficulties ourselves; we cannot rely on higher levels. We must also plant spring vegetables, open up wasteland to get food earlier, and eat more bran and vegetables. On March 30th, in addition to delivering manure and plowing the land, children and the elderly spent two days digging up 3,166 *jin* of medicinal herbs, earning 63,320 yuan, which could buy three *shi* of rice. Zhao Bugui, a member of the poor and hired peasant group, said, 'I dug up 20 *jin* of medicinal herbs in one day, earning 400 yuan, and also carried five loads of manure to the fields.'" Middle peasant Liu Laike dug up 50 *jin* of medicinal herbs in one day, earning 1,000 yuan. That evening, everyone felt that digging up medicinal herbs was very beneficial and made further plans. The enthusiasm of the masses for self-reliance in production increased and was closely combined with replenishment. Although the land issue was not large, everyone requested that it be determined before spring plowing. After mobilizing self-reporting of land holdings in poor and hired peasant group meetings and farmers' association meetings, everyone felt that the reports were generally accurate, and replenishment was only needed in a few cases. The leadership announced that land rights would remain largely unchanged, with only a small amount of voluntary replenishment among individuals, and that there would be no disruptive redistribution. Middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against would also be given a considerable amount of land. In the ten days or so after the meetings, four-fifths of the manure for the whole village had been carried out, and over 900 *mu* of land had been harrowed. The forty-five women were all spinning thread on their spinning wheels, and seven of the twenty machines had begun to be connected, showing high production enthusiasm.

    安丰改正错订成份
    群众生产情绪提高
    【昔阳消息】八区安丰成立起贫雇小组，组织新农会后，大家要求慎重划阶级，在每次贫农小组和农会上，一般反映对三查中追三代划成份很不满。这种错误在思想上造下恶果，形成严重浪费不生产现象，在这个问题上咯吵的很激烈。中农郭凤同说：“俺村在三查时六十四户划出三十户封建，心里害怕不好好生产”。米中说：“我和我爹当觅汉放牛，三查时划我封建。”李千居说：“自划成封建后不想过啦，除没生产还费吃了一石二斗荞麦。”大家说，去年王区长领导三查扣起七户，二十四口人，吃了二十天大锅饭，闹不清谁是封建，谁是自己人，怎能生产？计共把贫雇划成封建的三户，中农斗错的十一户。工作组根据群众要求，以贫雇为骨干进行民主划阶级，也运用了三榜定案的方法，保证不屈一个人，全村共划出五户地主。过去在三查中划错或被斗了的中农，都划过农民方面来。
    由于敌灾严重，旱灾连遭二年，群众的农具吃喝都很困难。当时没吃的就有十九户，七一口人（内有二户地主，人十一口），吃到秋后的全村只有三户，其余大部能吃到三月至四月。大家反映：春耕生产好好干，没吃就是大困难。当时工作组重视了灾荒的严重，如不适当想办法，对民主填补春耕生产是有很大影响的。经农会讨论，大家一致认识：“除政府贷款二十五万元解决农具纺织困难外，大困难还是咱解决，不能靠上级。还要种春菜，开荒早接嘴，多吃糠菜。三月卅号除送粪耕地外，儿童老汉两天时间刨药材三一六六斤，赚洋六三三二○元，能买三石来米。贫雇组员赵步贵说：一天刨药二十斤，赚洋四○○元，还担到地五担粪”。中农刘来科一天刨药五十斤，赚洋一千元。当天晚上大家认为刨药很沾光，又订了计划。大家生产自救的情绪提高起来，并与填补密切结合。土地问题虽然不大，大家要求在春耕前确定好。在贫雇小组会和农会上经发动自报土地，大家反映差不多了，填补是少数。领导上宣布地权大体不动，只有少数互相自愿抽补些，绝不打乱平分。对斗错的中农也要给相当数量土地。会后十来天当中全村的粪担出五分之四，耙了九百余亩地。妇女们四十五辆车都在纺线，二十架机，有七架开始陆续拴连，生产劲头很高。（千周、贵科、耀先、安丰通讯组）
