　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. News from all sides: On the 13th, a Dutch-Imperialist delegation went to Yogyakarta. When the train arrived at the Bogorkakal Station, thousands of people swarmed around the train cars, preventing the delegation from getting off. The head of the Dutch-Imperialist delegation, the Indonesian national scum Wei Zhuozhuo Mozhuo (note: i.e., the Deputy Prime Minister of the Dutch-Indies temporary federal puppet government, a major accomplice of the Indonesian people's public enemy Van Mook's enslavement rule), and other representatives of the temporary federal government were immediately denounced by the masses. In the face of the excited crowd, some members of the delegation were even beaten. The masses unanimously declared that they would fight to the end for the complete independence of Indonesia. Some police officers at the station expressed sympathy for the righteous actions of the masses and did not interfere at all. It is reported that when the Hatta reactionary government received the Dutch-Imperialists' protest note regarding the above-mentioned incident, it actually claimed to be "deeply regretful" and shamelessly stated that "measures will be taken to prevent such incidents from happening again."
