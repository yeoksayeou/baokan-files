　　Communication Exchange
　　No. 24
　　To the Editor:
　　Regarding the article published in our newspaper on March 19th, "The Xiangyuan Nanlixin Work Group Reviews Old Work Styles, Corrects the Tendency of Taking Everything Into One's Own Hands." Aside from doubts about the class divisions in that village, how exactly did the work group take everything into its own hands when it started organizing and reviewing the poor and hired peasant groups? For instance, what methods were used to absorb middle peasants and then get them to leave again? What does it mean by "all cadres suspended from their positions for self-reflection," and why were cadres afraid, yet the poor and hired peasant group leader was asked to apologize to the cadres and make amends? ... What kind of work style—taking everything into one's own hands, commandism, or tailism—played the main role?
　　The work group has reviewed the past and decided to combine party rectification, democracy, and filling vacancies in the future. Based on the situation in this village, why is it necessary to proceed in this way? What specific methods will be used to combine them? The newspaper's explanation of the above questions is too simple, and I don't understand it clearly. Because I also have old work styles during the period of dividing up the land, I hope the Nanlixin work group can provide some answers so I can learn from your lessons and correct our mistakes.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Reader Xiuyu
　　Comrade Xiuyu from Anyang has raised several points for discussion regarding the self-criticism of the Xiangyuan Nanlixin work group. This spirit of learning with an open mind is worthy of promotion. Please ask the Nanlixin work group to respond to the questions raised by Comrade Xiuyu. We also hope that comrades participating in land reform in various regions will launch a discussion on how to establish a new work style in their work and send in their self-examination and reflection materials.

    编辑同志：
    咱报上三月十九日登的襄垣南里信工作组检查旧作风，纠正包办代替的偏向一文。除对该村的阶级划分有怀疑外，关于工作组着手组织和审查贫雇组，到底是怎样包办法。如吸收进来的中农是用什么办法又叫中农出去的。什么叫干部一律停职反省，为何见干部害怕又叫贫雇组长去和干部道歉赔不是。………究竟在工作上的包办、命令和尾巴主义，那种作风占主要地位？
    工作组检查了过去，确定今后把整党民主与填补结合进行的方法。根据这村的情况，为什么要这样进行？用什么具体办法来结合？以上几个问题，报上说的简单我闹不清楚。因为我在闹平分时也存在着旧作风，希望南里信工作组给解答一下，好接受你们的教训，改正我们的错误。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　读者　秀宇
    安阳秀宇同志对襄垣南里信工作组的检讨，提出几点商讨意见，这种虚心学习的精神是值得提倡的。请南里信工作组对秀宇同志所提问题予以答复；并希各地参加土改同志，对于如何在工作中树立新作风的问题展开讨论，并把自我检查反省材料寄来。
