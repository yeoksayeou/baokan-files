Title: Does the Working Group's Report to the Masses on the Rectification Process Constitute Paternalism?

People's Daily:

Regarding the question of whether the working group's report to the masses on the rectification process constitutes paternalism:

In the article "The Mass Rectification in Hexi Concludes" on the first page of the April 4th issue, the last paragraph states: "That evening, the working group, at the farmers' association meeting, reported the entire process of the rectification... to the masses..."

I feel that as the rectification reaches its concluding stage, the awareness of the masses and party members has improved to a certain extent. At this time, the village branch should directly meet with the farmers' association, instead of the working group still acting as an intermediary. Doing so seems to imply a reluctance to entrust the matter to the masses and party members themselves, a lack of faith in them. What impression will be left when the working group leaves? Is this due to paternalistic tendencies or the working group feeling the need to "follow procedures" to give an account of "their own" work? Even if the masses and party members, or even the branch, are not yet able to "handle their own affairs," or if it is estimated that they cannot handle it as perfectly as our working group imagines, it would still be better to give them opportunities for tempering, testing, and improvement based on their current level! Otherwise, over time, they will become overly reliant. While that might seem good, they will not be able to take over when the working group leaves, and the work will not be carried on smoothly. Comrade ××:

Regarding the issue raised in the letter, we feel that in the previous period, to some extent, we did have some paternalistic tendencies. We have already paid attention to overcoming and correcting this. The issue of "not being able to carry on smoothly" is also something that working groups in various localities should pay attention to, and we are very vigilant about this problem. However, the working group's report to the masses at the conclusion of the rectification in Hexi was not paternalistic, because the rectification in that village was always led by the working group. A final report to the masses by the working group is of educational significance to the masses.

As for the issue of the branch meeting with the farmers' association, it has been reported many times in the village that, in fact, the branch members have been participating in various mass activities since the rectification of the mass organizations. Most party members joined the farmers' association (and all joined after the rectification concluded), and some party members were elected as cadres. In the democratic supplementary training movement, the branch activities also played a certain role. It was not a matter of shutting the door and letting the party members conduct introspection in isolation, but rather of letting the branch members participate in the mass movement to be tested and rectified. The leadership of the Party has been consistently implemented throughout this process; otherwise, completely entrusting the rectification to the masses would inevitably lead to tailism.

This is our response. If there is anything inappropriate, please continue to point it out.

### 工作组向群众报告整党经过是否包办？

　　工作组向群众报告整党经过是否包办？人民日报：
    四月四日第一版“河西群众整党结束”一稿中，最后一段云：“当晚，工作组在农会大会上，将整党整个过程，……向群众作了报告。………”
    我觉得：整党到了结束阶段，群众和党员觉悟都有了一定的提高，这时应该由村支部直接和农会见面，不应该再由工作组出面夹在里头，那样做似乎不敢交给群众和党员自己，不相信他们；如果工作组一走会留下什么印象呢？是不是有包办代替或工作组认为“自己”工作需要“按步就班”交代一番之故呢？如果群众和党员甚至这个支部还不能“自己办自己的事”，或者估计不能办得如我们工作组所想象的那样完善，但总不如就其现有程度给以＠炼、考验与提高的机会为宜！不然，时间久了他们依赖成性，好倒是好，可是工作组一走，他们却接不上手，工作上接不上气。××同志：
    来信所提问题，我们感觉到在前一时期，某种程度上说我们曾经是有些包办代替作风的，这已注意克服纠正，“接不上气”的问题，也值得各地工作组注意，我们也十分警惕了这一问题。但河西整党结束时，由工作组向群众作了报告，这样做法并不是包办代替，因该村整党一直由工作组领导，最后由工作组向群众报告，对群众是有教育意义的。
    至于支部与农会见面问题，已历见本村屡次报导，事实上该村支部党员，从整顿群众队伍以来，就一直参加了群众各种活动，大部党员参加农会（到结束整党后全部都加入农会了），有的党员被当选为干部。在民主抽补运动中，支部活动也起了一定作用，并非关起门来单独让党员进行反省，而是把支部党员放手到群众运动中去考验，去整顿，其中一直贯彻了党的领导，否则，把整党完全交由群众处理，必然是做了尾巴主义。
    特此答复，如有不妥之处，还望继续指正。
