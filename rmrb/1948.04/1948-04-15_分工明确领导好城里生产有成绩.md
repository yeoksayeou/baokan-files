Clear Division of Labor and Good Leadership Lead to Achievements in Urban Production

[Shexian News] Since the establishment of the urban production committee, with a clear division of labor, significant achievements have been made in half a month. For example, the relief section surveyed and visited more than fifty households in each lane who had no food or not enough to eat. After discussion and research by cadres above the level of agricultural association group leaders, and examination by the general assembly of farmers, it was finally decided to temporarily lend over 1,600 jin of grain from the more than 2,000 jin of grain stored by the agricultural association to 52 households to solve the problem of food. A total of more than 1,600 jin of grain was lent out, and preparations were also made to lend money to overcome the difficulty of agricultural tools. The maximum loan was sixty jin of rice, and the minimum was twenty jin of rice. After overcoming the difficulties, everyone's enthusiasm for production increased. The technical leadership section guides the tree planting movement and seizes the opportunity to plant cotton. Ren Manting, an honest middle peasant in his sixties, created a method of planting cotton by mixing cotton seeds with boiling water and then covering them with ash overnight without letting the air out before sowing. When planting, it is best to use mule and horse manure or ash fertilizer. The old man planted three mu by himself. Under his promotion, the whole village plowed 135.4 mu of cotton fields and planted more than 50 mu of cotton in two days. The investigation section reviewed the past practice of land cultivation. Because the support for land cultivation for dependents of soldiers resisting the enemy in the past was a temporary allocation of manpower and animal power, many workdays were lost on the land of dependents of soldiers resisting the enemy, and grain could not be harvested. This year, 56 mu of land belonging to 23 households of poor, hired, orphaned, widowed, elderly, weak, and those without labor, as well as dependents of soldiers resisting the enemy, was divided among 85 laborers, and the land cultivating households were fixed. Some land cultivating households were not ideologically clear. The production committee explained and mobilized, saying, "Soldiers sacrifice and shed blood on the front lines for the masses. We live and produce in peace in the rear. It is right to cultivate for a few workdays." After this mobilization and explanation, both the land cultivating households and the dependents of soldiers resisting the enemy agreed. Ren Mu, a dependent of soldier Resisting the Enemy, said, "Now I don't have to bother looking for people anymore." (Chen Liang)

　　分工明确领导好城里生产有成绩
    【涉县消息】城里生产委员会成立后，分工明确，经半月时间，有显著成绩。如救济股调查访问各闾没吃或不够吃的有五十余户，经过农会组长以上干部评议研究，又经全体农民大会审查，最后决定将农会存的两千余斤粮内暂借给五十二户解决吃的困难。共借出粮一千六百余斤，还准备借款克服农具的困难，最多者借米六十斤，最少者借米廿斤，克服了困难，大家生产劲头更高涨起来。技术领导股，指导栽树运动，又抓住种棉，六十多岁的老实中农任满庭，创造种花办法，用开水将花籽拌好，再用灰蒙一夜不要泄气，即可下种；栽时上骡马粪或灰粪最好。该老汉一人栽了三亩，在他推动下全村共犁花地一百卅五亩四分，两天种上花五十余亩。调查股将往年代耕作了检讨，因过去对抗属代耕都是临时拨人畜力，使抗属地误很多工，还打不下粮。今年将贫雇孤寡老弱无劳力及廿三户抗属地五十六亩，分给八十五个劳力，固定了代耕户。有些代耕户思想不大通，生产委员会解释动员说：“军人在前方牺牲流血为群众，咱们在后方安居生产，代耕几个工是应该的。”经这样动员解释后，代耕户及抗属双方同意，抗属二任母说：“这可不用咱再忙着找人了。”　　　　　（陈良）
