　　Important Correction

　　According to a cable from the head office: In the news item "Xinhua News Agency Reporter Comments on the Sinister Dealings of Chiang and the US" published on page two of this newspaper yesterday (the 11th), the date "March 30th" was a mistake for "April 2nd." The figure for the amount of US imperialist aid to Chiang "at 363 million..." was a mistake for "at 338 million..."; "another 100 million US dollars granted..." was a mistake for "another 125 million US dollars granted...", we hereby issue this correction.

　　重要更正
    据总社来电：昨日（十一日）本报二版所载“新华社记者评蒋美罪恶买卖”消息中，日期“三月三十日”系“四月二日”之误。美帝援蒋数目字“以三亿六千三百万……”系“以三亿三千八百万……”之误；“另一亿美元赠予……”系“另一亿二千五百万美元赠予……”之误，特此更正。
