Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 2nd. Over ten landlords who fled from Shanyin County have returned one after another, inspired by the liberated area's policy of guaranteeing the lives of landlords. Hou Wenqiang and two other landlords in the city fled to Ying County last year, eking out a living as small merchants. Under the Kuomintang bandits' exorbitant taxes and levies, they were unable to maintain their livelihoods and have now fled back, requesting land for production. Zhao Jin, a landlord from Guangwu Town, suffered all kinds of hardships in Fu Zuoyi's bandit area in Suiyuan. After returning home last month and learning about the democratic government's policy towards landlords, he immediately went to Suiyuan to bring back his family. The democratic government welcomed their repentance and return and the Farmers' Association has already distributed the land and property they are entitled to according to law, helping them settle down and start production.

　　山阴逃亡地主悔悟归来
  　农会依法分给土地财物
    【新华社晋绥二日电】山阴县逃亡地主十余人，在解放区保障地主生活政策感召下，已相继归来。城内地主侯文强等三人去年逃到应县，以小商糊口，在蒋匪苛杂压榨下，生活无法维持，现已逃回，要求分地生产。广武镇地主赵晋在绥远傅匪区受尽各种磨折后，于上月回家，了解民主政府对地主政策后，立即去绥远接回家眷。民主政府对彼等悔悟归来，表示欢迎。并已由农会依法分给应得之土地财物，帮助其安家生产。
