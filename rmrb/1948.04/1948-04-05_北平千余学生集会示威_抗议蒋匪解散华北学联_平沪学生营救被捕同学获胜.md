Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st – According to reports from various sources: On the occasion of the opening of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet National Assembly, over a thousand students from major middle schools in Beiping held a demonstration rally at Peking University on the 29th, protesting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's North China Headquarters' order to dissolve the North China Student Federation, which was composed of students from major middle schools in Beiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan. The venue was plastered with slogans opposing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's order to dissolve the Beiping Student Federation and to carry out counter-revolutionary civil war. Professors delivered speeches at the meeting denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's policies. Student speakers pointed out with fervor: Ordering the dissolution of the North China Student Federation and suppressing the patriotic and democratic student movement, this is the true face of Chiang Kai-shek's fascist puppet National Assembly. Unless every student in North China is imprisoned, the North China Student Federation will continue to exist forever, and it can never be dissolved by Chiang Kai-shek. During the rally, the campus was heavily surrounded by fully armed Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops and police, police cars constantly patrolled outside the campus, and the nearby streets were densely packed with sentry posts, completely cutting off traffic. Chiang Kai-shek's military police even set up American-style machine guns on the roofs in front of the Peking University gate to intimidate the students, but the students paid no attention. The rally proceeded in an impassioned atmosphere. After the meeting, Peking University students disregarded the fascist "Student Union Organizational Rules" promulgated by Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Education and conducted democratic student union elections. A Peking University professor told a foreign reporter: The student movement cannot be suppressed; even if the organization is dissolved, the struggle will continue. When Chiang Kai-shek's military police surrounded Peking University, a foreign reporter's film of the Chiang Kai-shek military police's ugly intimidation of the students was forcibly confiscated by Chiang Kai-shek. Furthermore, the North China Student Federation has submitted a letter of protest to Chiang Kai-shek's Beiping Headquarters, stating that the purpose of the federation is to lead students to protect human rights, promote student welfare, and strive to realize true democratic politics, expressing indignation and contempt for Chiang Kai-shek's North China Headquarters' order to dissolve the federation.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd – Beiping News: Students in Beiping and Shanghai launched heroic struggles to rescue arrested classmates and protect human rights. Song Guozhu, a Peking University student, Gao Tongqing, a Tsinghua University student, and Xu Qiheng, a North China College student, who were arrested in Beiping on February 1st, were "released on bail pending trial" by Chiang Kai-shek on February 28th under the active rescue efforts of their classmates. Another Peking University student, Deng Te, who was arrested, was brutally tortured and injured by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. At the end of February, his condition worsened, and he was transferred to the Peking University Affiliated Hospital for treatment. Peking University students are extremely indignant about this, and the student union has lodged a protest with Chiang Kai-shek's Beiping Headquarters. Students at Beiping Normal College are promoting the spirit of solidarity and conducting a "5,000 yuan fundraising campaign" for Deng Te. Gu Yuyi and Jin Guobao, representatives of the Chaoyang College Law Group petitioning for public funds, have been arrested in Nanjing for more than a month. On March 22nd, the students of the college sent representatives to demand that Chiang Kai-shek's Beiping Headquarters immediately telegram Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense Military Law Department to release them immediately, otherwise they would protest with action. Jian Yan, Sun Dingyu, Weng Xiyi, and Ren Xinchi, four students from Fudan University in Shanghai, were arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits near the school on March 22nd. Under the active rescue efforts of the students, Chiang Kai-shek's police bureau was forced to release the four students at noon the next day.

　　北平千余学生集会示威
  　抗议蒋匪解散华北学联
    平沪学生营救被捕同学获胜
    【新华社陕北一日电】据各方报导：蒋匪伪国大开幕之际，北平各大中学学生千余人，二十九日在北大举行示威大会，抗议蒋匪华北行辕下令解散由平、津、唐山各大中学学生组成的华北学联，会场遍贴反对蒋匪下令解散北平学联及进行反革命的内战标语。会上教授发表抨击蒋匪政策的演说。学生发言人则激昂指出：下令解散华北学联，压迫学生爱国民主运动，这就是蒋匪法西斯傀儡国大的真面目。除非华北每一个学生都被关入监狱，否则华北学联将继续永远存在，而决非蒋匪所能解散。集会时校外为全副武装的蒋匪军警重重包围，警车在校外不断巡逻，附近街道密布哨岗，交通完全断绝，蒋匪宪兵则竟在北大校门前的房顶上架设美式机枪横加恫吓，但学生毫不理睬。大会在激昂气氛下进行。会后北大学生蔑视蒋匪教育部颁布法西斯的“学生自治会组织规则”，进行民主的自治会竞选。北大某教授对外籍记者表示：学生运动是镇压不住的，即令组织被解散，斗争仍将继续。在蒋匪军警包围北大时，一外籍记者摄取的蒋匪军警恫吓学生丑态的胶片，为蒋匪强予没收。又：华北学联已向蒋匪北平行辕提出抗议书，申述该会目的系领导学生保护人权，增进学生福利，并为实现真正的民主政治而奋斗，对蒋匪北平行辕下令解散表示愤慨与轻蔑。
    【新华社陕北三日电】北平讯：北平、上海两地学生为营救被捕同学与保障人权而展开英勇斗争。二月一日在平被捕的北大学生宋国柱、清华高同庆、华北学院徐启恒三人，在同学积极营救下，蒋匪已于二月二十八日被迫答应三学生“保释候讯”。另一北大被捕学生邓特，则惨遭蒋匪酷刑拷打受伤，二月底病势转重移住北大附属医院治疗。北大同学对此愤慨异常，已经由学生自治会向蒋匪北平行辕提出抗议。北平师院学生则发扬友爱精神，为邓特进行“五千元募捐运动”。朝阳学院司法组争取公费请愿代表谷雨仪、金国保在南京被捕已月余。该院学生于三月二十二日派出代表要求蒋匪北平行辕速电蒋匪国防部军法处立即释放，否则将以行动抗议。上海复旦大学学生简延、孙定瑜、翁锡益、任心池四人，三月二十二日在学校附近横遭蒋匪逮捕。在该校同学积极营救下，蒋匪警局被迫于翌日中午将该四生释放。
