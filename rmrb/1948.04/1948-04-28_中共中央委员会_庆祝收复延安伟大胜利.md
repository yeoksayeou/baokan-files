Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. The CCP Central Committee sent a telegram on the 24th to congratulate the Northwest People's Liberation Army on the victory of recovering Yan'an. The original telegram is as follows:

    Comrades Peng Dehuai, He Long, Lin Boqu, Xi Zhongxun, and all comrades of the Northwest People's Liberation Army: We celebrate your great victory in recovering Yan'an. When the Kuomintang bandit army occupied Yan'an on March 19th of last year, we asserted that this occupation would mark the failure of the Kuomintang bandit army and the victory of the Chinese people. All events over the past year and more have fully proven this assertion. Now, upon the recovery of Yan'an, we extend our condolences to our heroic Northwest People's Liberation Army, all the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and all the people of Yan'an. We hope that you will continue to work hard and strive to eliminate all the bandit troops and liberate the entire Northwest.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 25th. The Liberation Armies on the Central Plains Front have jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, the CCP Central Committee, Deputy Commander Peng, Deputy Commander Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Commander Zhao Shoushan, and all commanders and fighters of the Northwest Liberation Army, congratulating them on the recovery of Yan'an, stating:

    The news of the recovery of Yan'an has made all the commanders and fighters on the Central Plains Front extremely joyful. Our glorious Yan'an, which is watched by the whole country and the whole world, has returned to our hands after only one year and one month. This fact alone proves the increasing weakness and rapid collapse of the bandit Chiang, and proves the powerful invincibility and courageous fighting of the Northwest People's Liberation Army. It makes all our commanders and fighters deeply experience the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao's strategic guidance. We are now fighting for the complete liberation of the Central Plains region, in order to coordinate with the Northwest brother troops to completely liberate the Great Northwest.

    Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian, Chen Yi, Su Yu, Chen Shiqu, Tang Liang, Chen Geng, Xie Fuzhi, and all commanders and fighters of the Central Plains Front

    中共中央委员会
    庆祝收复延安伟大胜利
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】中共中央二十四日电贺西北我军收复延安之捷，原电如下：
    彭德怀、贺龙、林伯渠、习仲勋诸同志及西北人民解放军全体同志们：庆祝你们收复延安的伟大胜利。去年三月十九日国民党匪军占领延安的时候，我们就断言这种占领将标志着国民党匪军的失败和中国人民的胜利，一年多以来的一切事变，充分地证明了这一断言。今当收复延安的时候，特向我英勇的西北人民解放军、陕甘宁边区全体人民及延安全体人民致慰问之意。尚望继续努力，为消灭全部匪军，解放整个西北而奋斗。
    中共中央委员会
    【新华社中原前线二十五日电】中原前线各解放军顷联名向毛主席、中共中央、彭副总司令、张宗逊副司令员、赵寿山副司令员暨西北解放军全体指战员电贺收复延安称：
    收复延安的捷报传来，使中原前线全体指战员欢腾万分。为全国和全世界所注目的我们的光荣的延安，仅在一年零一个月的时间后又回到我们的手中。仅仅这个事实的本身，就证明了蒋贼的愈益无力和迅速崩溃；证明了西北人民解放军的强大无敌和勇敢善战；更使我们全体指战员深深的体验到毛主席战略指导的英盟。我们现正为全部解放中原地区，以配合西北兄弟部队完全解放大西北的英勇战斗而战。
    刘伯承、邓小平、李先念、陈毅、粟裕、陈士渠、唐亮、陈赓、谢富治暨中原前线全体指战员
