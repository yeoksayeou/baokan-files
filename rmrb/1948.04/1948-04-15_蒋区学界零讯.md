　　▲More than 500 students from Nankai University, Peiyang University, and Hebei Institute of Technology in Tianjin arrived in Beiping on the 27th of last month for sightseeing. On the evening of the 28th, students from Beiping and Tianjin held a campfire gathering at the Peking University playground, attended by nearly 10,000 students from various schools and citizens. Representatives from Peking and Nankai Universities delivered speeches successively, calling on students in Beiping and Tianjin who were pursuing the light to unite. Representatives of the North China Student Federation called for "Defending the autonomy association's joint defense, sharing weal and woe," and explained that rescuing the education crisis could not be solved by money alone, hoping that everyone would unite and work hard.
    ▲The Chiang bandit Beiping Garrison Command, acting on the orders of the Chiang bandit "Central Government," issued an order on the 28th of last month to "ban the North China Student Federation."
    ▲When the Shanghai Chiang bandit Local Court fabricated charges to try Huang Kelu, Pan Yongbang, and other eleven arrested students from Tongji University on the 15th of last month, students from various schools in Shanghai presented flags to the persecuted classmates. The flag of Jiaotong University read: "Swear to them that the Bastille of China will be broken by us!" (Note: "Bastille" was the famous prison where the French tyrant Louis XIV imprisoned revolutionaries, which was stormed during the French Revolution in the late 18th century); Tongji University wrote: "Vow to support the persecuted classmates"; Chuneng Middle School wrote: "The bond of truth will forever bind us together." After the court session, a female student presented flowers to the persecuted students who stood up for the truth to show her respect.
    ▲The Chiang bandit Shanghai authorities arrested several students from China Women's Middle School and Shanghai Municipal Women's Normal School on the 26th of last month. The bandit authorities also stated that they would resolutely crack down on progressive middle school students.
    ▲Five hundred students at Central China University, which is run by Du Yuming, the bandit of Shenyang, had run out of food by the end of March, and more than 300 of them were so hungry that they were bedridden. The school's president, Wang Dajie, ran around for days and obtained 300 catties of grain, which was only enough for one meal of thin porridge.
    ▲The food for government-funded students at Shanghai Jiaotong University is extremely poor, with a lot of sand and stones in the rice. Students call it "four heart rice," meaning "sad to eat, chilling to hear, painful to see, and disgusting to smell." Due to malnutrition, two students at the school fainted on the spot during a physical examination the other day.
    ▲Some students at the Sino-French University in Beiping cannot afford to pay for their meals and wait in the dining hall after their classmates have finished eating to pick up leftovers to eat. According to the Tianjin Yishibao on the 15th of last month, more than 20 people have fallen ill one after another.
    ▲At the beginning of March, Yiju Silver Company in Beiping recruited several apprentices, and nearly 100 people applied, including several university teaching assistants and many university graduates. The severity of the unemployment problem in Beiping is evident from this.

    ▲天津南开、北洋、河北工学院等校学生五百余人，上月二十七日抵北平观光。二十八日晚平、津学生在北大操场举行联欢营火大会，到各校学生及市民近万人。北京、南开两校代表相继致词，号召追求光明的平、津同学团结起来。华北学联代表呼吁“保卫自治会联防，同甘苦共生死”，并说明要抢救教育危机，仅是钱不能解决问题，希望大家团结努力。

    ▲上海交通大学公费生伙食甚劣，米中砂石极多，同学称之为“四心饭”，即“吃来伤心、听来寒心、看来痛心、嗅来恶心”。该校学生因营养不良，日前两学生检验体格时竟当场昏厥。
    ▲北平中法大学一部分学生无力缴纳伙食费，每餐等候同学饭毕再进饭厅捡拾残饭充饥。据上月十五日天津益世报称：已有二十余人相继病倒。
