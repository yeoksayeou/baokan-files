　　Nangong City Government Established
  　Protect Industry, Commerce and Prosper the Market
    [Nangong News] The Nangong City Committee and the City Government were formally established on April 9th. The city is a commercial area with a population of over 15,000, of which merchants account for two-thirds. Land is scarce, and most people rely on business to make a living. In order to develop industry and commerce, benefit both labor and capital, and improve the lives of workers and urban poor, the District Committee and the Prefectural Commissioner's Office specially appointed Comrade Wang Tingyi as the Mayor of Nangong City, and Comrade Xia Qiugang as the Secretary of the Nangong City Committee. On the afternoon of April 9th, more than 60 people, including heads of various agencies and representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, the Trade Union, schools, hospitals, and various streets, held a tea party to announce the establishment of the City Committee and the City Government. Comrades Xia and Wang officially took office and began working. At the meeting, Mayor Wang and Secretary Xia reported on the current main tasks: assisting the poor in production, solving all the difficulties of merchants, and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instructions to protect and develop industry and commerce, hoping that all merchants will eliminate all ideological concerns and boldly strive to operate. They also pointed out that Party members on each street should immediately correct their past work style of being divorced from the masses, and strive for the prosperity of Nangong City's commerce.
