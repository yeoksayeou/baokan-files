    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th: Washington dispatch: The movement to defend peace and democracy is unfolding across the United States. According to a TASS dispatch on the 20th: Over one hundred "Students for Wallace Committees" held large-scale demonstrations against conscription and universal military training in thirty-one states, with 75,000 students participating. Harvard University students defeated saboteurs and held a "peace demonstration" march in Boston. Many veterans brought their children, who held signs that read: "I don't want my father to go to war!" Columbia University in New York (President is Eisenhower) held a thousand-person demonstration. Writer Howard Fast strongly denounced Truman, Forrestal, and other imperialists at the meeting, and powerfully pointed out: These American rulers are extremely afraid of the peace movement of the American people. Richardson, chairman of the "Wallace for President Committee," also delivered a speech. When he condemned Eisenhower for defending racial discrimination in the U.S. military, the audience burst into cheers. Lee pointed out: "A person with this kind of thinking cannot be a good university president, let alone a good president of the United States." According to a correspondent of the Rome Republican newspaper in Washington: "Representatives of many political and scientific organizations in the United States have risen up to oppose the current U.S. government's expansion and war-gambling policies." At the same time, the American people are widely flocking to the "Wallace Movement" and taking practical actions to counter Truman's persecution of the democratic progressive movement. According to Wallace's campaign manager, Baldwin, announced on the 19th: In California alone, 500,000 people have signed petitions to nominate Wallace as a presidential candidate.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th: New York dispatch: The notorious House Un-American Activities Committee proposed a bill on the 10th to persecute the U.S. Communist Party and other democratic groups with "ten years of imprisonment" and "ten thousand dollar fines," which aroused fierce opposition from the American people. The Central Committee of the U.S. Communist Party issued a statement on the 14th, denouncing this proposal as "bearing the mask of anti-communism, but in reality, it contains the evil conspiracy of both parties to oppose the democratic principles embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights." The statement pointed out: If this bill is passed, "it will take American-style fascism a big step forward." The statement called on American democratic forces to rise up and urge Congress to reject the bill. The "Civil Rights Congress" on the same day condemned the bill as "imitating Hitler's tricks in 'Mein Kampf,'" pointing out: "The committee, under the pretext of 'anti-communism,' is actually attempting to outlaw the entire labor movement and democratic groups."

    各州学生反征兵示威
    美共斥责当局迫害民主法西斯措施
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】华盛顿讯：保卫和平民主的运动，正在美国各地展开。据塔斯社二十日电报导：一百余个“拥护华莱士学生委员会”，在三十一个州举行反对征兵与普遍军训的大示威，参加的学生达七万五千人。哈佛大学学生击败破坏分子的干涉，在波士顿市举行“和平示威”游行时，许多当过兵的学生带着他们的孩子，孩子们手举标语牌，上面写着：“我不要我的父亲去打仗！”纽约哥伦比亚大学（校长为艾森豪威尔）召开了千人示威大会，作家法斯特在会上痛斥杜鲁门、福莱斯特尔等帝国主义分子，并有力地指出：这些美国统治者对于美国内人民的和平运动是极端害怕的。“华莱士竞选总统委员会”主席李察逊也发表演说，当他谴责艾森豪威尔替美国军队中歧视黑人诡辩时，会上响起一片欢呼声。李氏指出：“有这种思想的人，既不能当好一个大学校长，更不能当好一个美国总统的。”另据罗马共和报驻华盛顿记者说：“美国许多政治和科学团体的代表，纷起反对目前美政府的扩张与战争赌博政策。”与此同时，美国人民以广泛涌入“华莱士运动”，并以实际行动，反击杜鲁门对民主进步运动的迫害。据华莱士的竞选干事巴尔德温十九日宣布：仅在加利福尼亚一州，就有五十万人签名推举华莱士为总统候选人。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】纽约讯：臭名昭著的美众院非美活动委员会，于十日提出阴谋以“十年监禁”“万元罚金”迫害美共及其他民主团体的法案后，引起美国人民的猛烈反对。美共中央委员会于十四日发表声明，斥责这一建议“带上反共的假面具，实际上则包藏着两党反对独立宣言与权利法案所体现的民主原则的罪恶阴谋。”声明指出：如果这一法案获得通过，“会使美国式的法西斯主义大进一步。”声明号召美国民主力量奋起敦促国会否决这一法案。“公民权利大会”同日痛斥这一法案为“仿效希特勒在‘我的奋斗’一书中的故技”，指出：“该委员会借口‘反共’，其实正企图使全部职工运动和民主团体成为非法。”
