Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Guangzhou dispatch: Traitor Soong Tzu-wen, under the orders of the American Chiang Kai-shek clique, is actively preparing to organize a South China colonial economic system including the five provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Jiangxi. On the 27th of last month, Chiang Kai-shek bandit Liu Jianxu, chairman of the Fujian province, went to Guangzhou to discuss with Soong the matter of "jointly funded" operation of large-scale industrial and mining enterprises and the construction of highways on the Fujian-Guangdong border. Recently, Soong is also preparing to organize the "South China Agricultural Improvement Committee" of the six provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Taiwan, so that American imperialism can further directly control South China's agriculture and link the five provinces of South China with the economy of Taiwan, which is under strict control of American imperialism. Prior to this, Chiang Kai-shek bandit Wang Dongyuan, chairman of Hunan Province, went to Guangdong in January and, with the direct participation of the Americans, agreed with Soong on a "construction" plan for ports, railways, electricity, and water conservancy to be invested by American imperialism. Among them, the Hunan-Guangxi Railway has been agreed to be built by the American "Jiangnan Construction Company." When Soong took office as the chairman of Guangdong Province last October, he invited Chiang Kai-shek bandit Huang Xuchu, chairman of Guangxi Province, to Guangdong to discuss the Guangxi "Industrial Plan," requiring Guangxi to allow the American Penny Lee Company to build the Liuzhou Power Plant and tin industry.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Shanghai newspapers reported on the 5th of last month: American imperialist capital is actively monopolizing Fujian's industry and agriculture. American merchant "Jiangnan Construction Company" engineer Dunard went to western Fujian and northern Fujian in late February to inspect various places and decided to invest in the development of hydropower, timber, papermaking, coal, iron, and other industries in nine counties including Nanping, Gutian, Jianyang, Jianzhen, Shaowu, Chong'an, Yong'an, Pucheng, and Liancheng. Another American engineer, Jin Jinshi, has forcibly "requisitioned" land of up to 2,000 acres on the opposite bank of Fuzhou under the guise of Chiang Kai-shek bandit official forces and used Minjiang timber to make paper.

Also reported: Canada plans to invest in the Pearl River water conservancy project to share the benefits of aggression in South China with American imperialism.

　　卖国贼宋子文奉美蒋命
    使华南变成殖民地
  　大修交通便利美帝侵略
    【新华社陕北十五日电】广州讯：卖国贼宋子文奉美蒋之命积极筹组包括粤桂闽湘赣五省的华南殖民地经济体系。上月廿七日蒋匪闽省主席刘建绪赴广州，与宋商讨由两省“合资”经营大规模工矿事业及修筑闽粤边境公路事宜。日前宋贼又在筹组粤桂闽湘赣台六省“华南农业改进委员会”，以便美帝进一步直接控制华南农业，并使华南五省与美帝严格控制下的台湾经济联系起来。在此以前，蒋匪湘省主席王东源曾于一月间赴粤，在美人直接参加下，与宋商定港埠、铁路、电力、水利等由美帝投资进行“建设”计划，其中湘桂路已商定由美国“江南建设公司”投资修建。去年十月宋就任蒋匪粤省主席之初，即曾邀请蒋匪桂省主席黄旭初到粤商订广西“工业计划”，要广西允许美国潘尼李公司开建柳州电力厂及锡工业。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】上月五日沪报载：美帝侵略资本积极垄断福建工农业，美商“江南建设公司”工程师杜纳德二月下旬曾赴闽西、闽北各地考察，决定投资开办南平、古田、建阳、建甄、邵武、崇安、永安、浦城、连城等九县水电动力、木材、造纸、煤、铁等业。另一美工程师晋金士已在福州对岸假蒋匪官方势力强力“征购”面积达二千亩之田地、利用闽江木材造纸。
    又讯：加拿大拟投资珠江水利工程，与美帝分尝华南侵略利益。
