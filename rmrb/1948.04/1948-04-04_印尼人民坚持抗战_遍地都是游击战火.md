Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Reports from various sources: The Indonesian people's resistance war continues. According to a TASS dispatch from The Hague on the 26th of last month, guerrilla warfare continues unabated throughout Java and Sumatra. Furthermore, news from Batavia indicates that Indonesian residents on Biak Island in northern New Guinea staged a riot in late last month to oppose the Dutch imperialist colonial authorities. Newspapers in The Hague reported that over 1,300 wounded soldiers recently arrived in the Netherlands. A reporter from the "De Waarheid" newspaper, after interviewing the wounded soldiers, wrote: "We once again demand the withdrawal of all troops stationed in Indonesia. The Dutch people are unwilling to send their sons to engage in fratricidal war for the interests of imperialism."
