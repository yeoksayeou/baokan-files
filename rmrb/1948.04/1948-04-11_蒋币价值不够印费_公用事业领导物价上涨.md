　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Shanghai News: The Chiang currency has plummeted to a new record low. On the 6th, the US dollar on the Shanghai black market rose to 570,000 Chiang currency, a sharp increase of 90,000 in one day, exceeding the highest price on the 19th of last month by 30,000, thus breaking through the temporary stability of the past two weeks. On the same day, the Chiang bandit bank's British exchange rate also increased from 255,000 on the 17th of last month to 324,000. The American-owned "China Press" stated that the Chiang currency has depreciated to a value less than the value of its own paper and printing costs. The Chiang bandit monopolized public utilities are also frantically raising prices, leading to price increases. Starting from the 5th, passenger and freight rates on the Pingjin and Pingsui railway lines have increased by 85%; ticket prices on the Jinpu Road and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road have also suddenly increased. Passenger ticket prices for the American-Chiang "China" and "Central" airlines suddenly increased by 49% starting on the 6th. Postage rates increased to 5,000 yuan per letter for regular mail starting on the 5th. Shipping fares for overseas routes increased by 90% for freight and 120% for passengers; fares for Yangtze River routes increased by 100% for freight and 120% for passengers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. New York News: The reactionary "Minneapolis Morning Tribune" admits that no amount of American aid to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang can save them from destruction. The newspaper commented on the wartime diary of the late General Stilwell on the 31st of last month, saying: "The main significance of Stilwell's article lies in the information revealed about Chiang Kai-shek and the people around him. He powerfully reminds everyone that no matter what assistance the United States gives to Chiang Kai-shek, the result will not be effective, just as the US assistance to Chiang during and after the war was ineffective."

　　蒋币价值不够印费
  　公用事业领导物价上涨
    【新华社陕北九日电】上海消息：蒋币惨跌又创新纪录。六日上海黑市美钞涨达蒋币五十七万元，一日猛涨九万，较上月十九日最高价已超出三万元，因而突破过去两周内的暂时平稳状态。同日蒋匪银行之英汇牌价亦已由上月十七日至二十五万五提高为三十二万四。美商大美晚报称：蒋币已贬值到不及它本身纸张及印费的价值。蒋匪垄断的公用事业亦疯狂涨价领导物价上涨。自五日起平津、平绥各线铁路客货运价，增加百分之八十五；津浦路及浙赣路票价亦突涨。美蒋的“中国”、“中央”两航空公司客运票价六日起突增百分之四十九。邮资五日起平信涨达五千元一封。轮船票价外洋班货运增加百分之九十，客运增加百分之一百二十；长江班货运增加百分之百、客运增加百分之一百二十。
    【新华社陕北八日电】纽约讯：反动的明尼亚波利斯论坛晨报承认，不论美国给予蒋家匪帮以什么援助，都挽救不了他们的覆灭。该报于上月三十一日评论已故史迪威将军的战时日记时说：“史氏文章的主要意义，系针对蒋介石及其周围人物所透露的消息。他极有力的提醒大家一点，即不论美国给蒋介石以什么援助，结果将不能发生效力，犹如战时与战后美国对蒋的援助不能生效一样”。
