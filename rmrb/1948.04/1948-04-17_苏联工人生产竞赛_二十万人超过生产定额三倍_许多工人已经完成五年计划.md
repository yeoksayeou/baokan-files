　　Soviet Workers' Production Competition
  　200,000 People Exceed Production Quotas by Three Times
    Many Workers Have Already Completed the Five-Year Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th] Moscow News: The nationwide workers are enthusiastically launching a major competition that started at the end of March to complete the May plan before the festival to welcome this year's International Labor Day. Now, news of amazing achievements from various places continues to come in. Last year, more than one million young workers across the Soviet Union completed the annual plan before the October Revolution Day. Now, more than 200,000 young workers have completed work exceeding their production quotas by two or even three times, and more than 15,000 people have reached the 1950 production level. Several factories in Moscow have completed the April production plan, especially the Kalinin Machinery Factory, the Budyonny Tractor and Auto Parts Factory, and the No. 3 Shoe Factory, which were the first to complete it. And a workshop of the Dynamo Factory has reached the 1950 level. A large number of workers at the Ordzhonikidze Machinery Factory in Kramatorsk guaranteed to complete the production plan for the first six months by April 20. Coal mines in the Donbass Basin are exceeding their plans every day, and the famous Torenkov team produces six days' worth of production quotas every day. At the Stalin Machinery Factory in Kuibyshev, 1,270 workers participating in the competition are producing according to the 1949 plan. 506 Stakhanovite workers have completed the five-year plan. The Soviet countryside is also conducting intense competitions without exception, striving to increase this year's harvest.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th] According to TASS: The French and German working classes are enthusiastically preparing to commemorate "May Day". The Central Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor has decided to immediately form the executive committee of the National Workshop Committee, calling on all trade union workers to hold grand parades and demonstrations on "May Day". The slogan for the French working class to commemorate "May Day" this year will be "Workers of all countries unite! Fight for lower prices and higher wages! Defend national independence!" The Confederation of Free German Trade Unions called on workers to strengthen the unity of trade unions to smash all the plans of the reactionaries, and to establish committees to prepare for the celebration of "May Day" in various trade unions, agencies, and regions. The Greater Berlin Confederation of Free German Trade Unions published an appeal in the Forum newspaper to welcome "May Day", calling on all German workers to fight for justice, peace in the world and in Germany. The appeal pointed out that in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to demand German unity, form an all-German government to establish a new democratic country, hand over basic industrial sectors to the people, and expel war criminals and monopoly capitalists from the economic sectors. The book called on the working people to strengthen unity and strive for trade unions to obtain the right to determine economic democratization and improve living standards.
