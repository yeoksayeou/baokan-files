Taiyue News: The militia in Xin'an, western Henan, which developed from the land distribution struggle, has eliminated 694 local Chiang troops in the past five months. After liberation in July of last year, local peasants rose up to distribute land. Landlords, despots, and local Chiang elements colluded to sabotage and kill peasants. The peasants then organized a militia to fight back. From November of last year to March of this year, in addition to small skirmishes involving three to five people, there were 225 relatively large battles. The militia killed and wounded 464 local Chiang troops and captured 230 people alive, including Hao Zhituan, an attached officer of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Detachment (excluding captured despots and landlords). They seized one heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, 298 rifles, eight pistols, and 3,949 rounds of ammunition, as well as radio stations, telephones, and other equipment.
