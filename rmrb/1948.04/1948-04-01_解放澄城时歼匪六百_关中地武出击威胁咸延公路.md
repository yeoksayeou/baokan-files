Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th: The results of the liberation of Chengcheng by the People's Liberation Army on the 27th are as follows: The 3rd Battalion (missing one company) of the 499th Regiment of Hu bandit’s 167th Brigade (rebuilt after being annihilated last May), and two teams each of the puppet county's Baojing (security police) and Changbei (regular defense) teams were wiped out. More than 600 officers and soldiers, including the puppet county magistrate Bai Zhixiu, were captured alive. Two 60mm mortars, 17 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 300 rifles, as well as some ammunition, were seized. On the morning of the 23rd, our troops in the Luochuan area damaged an enemy plane, which was forced to land in our liberated area southwest of Tongguan. The pilot escaped.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 29th: Local armed forces in various parts of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region continue to harass the remaining enemies in the rear and threaten the Hu bandit's transportation artery. The Yanshu Guerrilla Unit launched a surprise attack on the enemy stronghold of Yandianzi, 30 miles north of Yan'an City, on the evening of the 7th, annihilating 29 enemies. In mid-month, the local armed forces of the Guanzhong Sub-district launched attacks in Chunhua and Yao counties, threatening the Xianyang-Yan'an Highway, killing and capturing more than 40 enemies, and seizing more than 40 rifles and some ammunition. In addition, in the area south of Chunhua, they won over Wang Liucai, the puppet self-defense captain, and 14 others, who defected with their weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th: Relatives of Jiang bandit’s 29th Army Commander Liu Kan and others, who died for Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan in the Yichuan campaign, have sent people to the liberated area to transport their remains. They arrived in Baishui County, Huanglong Sub-district, on the 21st. The local democratic government immediately warmly received them and assisted them in going to Yichuan to handle the transportation matters. Since the Shaanxi-North Shaanxi Xinhua Broadcasting Station broadcasted at the beginning of this month that the family members of Liu Kan and others were instructed to come and transport the remains of Liu, etc., Liu's wife Zhang Yujie, who lived in Xi'an, Sun Shuzhen, wife of Yan Ming, commander of the 90th Division, Sun Zhizhi, wife of Zhou Youzhi, commander of the 31st Brigade, and Zhou Zhen, wife of Li Da, commander of the 47th Brigade, entrusted their relatives and friends Zhang Kunxuan, Wang Misuo, Zhao Changlu, and Wang Rongzhang to come to the liberated area. They set off on the 14th, but were forcibly ordered to return by the Hu bandits when they arrived in Weinan. Only Wang Misuo and Zhao Changlu managed to escape the obstruction and arrived in the liberated area. Furthermore, Yan Shouli, the stepson of Yan Ming (former communications battalion commander of the Hu bandit’s 90th Division headquarters), after being assisted by the People's Liberation Army in reburying Yan Ming's remains, returned to Xi'an to discuss the transportation matters with his aunt, but was unreasonably detained by the Hu bandits when he passed through Luochuan.
