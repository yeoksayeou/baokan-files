    Greek Reactionaries Prepare to Flee
    Anti-De Gaulle Movement Launched in France
    The Greek Democratic Army has continued to expand its brilliant victories in the past week. In addition to completely crushing the offensive of the Greek puppet army, directly commanded by the US and Britain, in several areas, it has also launched powerful offensives on all fronts. They have won successive victories, liberating three cities and vast areas in central, southern, and northern Greece, as well as important enemy strongholds such as Kalavryta in the Peloponnese Peninsula. At the same time, the spearhead of the offensive has directly threatened the suburbs of Athens, placing the Sophoulis dynasty in a state of siege. In addition to hurriedly mobilizing all military and police forces in the bandit nest of Athens, in a vain attempt to put up a desperate struggle, the reactionaries are also hastily preparing to flee. While urgently dispatching a special committee to Chios Island to arrange "post-war" affairs, Greek puppet Prime Minister Sophoulis exclaimed fearfully on the 19th: "The domestic situation may greatly deteriorate soon, and the government may evacuate to other cities."
    This week, the Italian general election has concluded, and the People's Democratic Front has won a major political victory. This election in Italy was conducted under extremely undemocratic and unfree circumstances. Before and during the election, US, British, and French imperialism and the Vatican carried out frantic joint interference, colluding with the De Gasperi reactionary camp to employ all kinds of despicable means, such as rigging, intimidation, enticement, coercion, and fraud. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti, in exposing the ugly face of the fake election, said: "Its barbarity is unmatched in any modern country." However, according to the figures released by the reactionary government, the People's Democratic Front still received the enthusiastic support of more than eight million voters, accounting for more than 31% of the national vote, while reactionary parties such as the Republican Party suffered a disastrous defeat. This proves that "the People's Democratic Front has gained strong political support nationwide, and the Italian reactionaries' plan to isolate the People's Democratic Front from the broad masses of the people has failed" (Solidarity Newspaper). At the same time, it must be pointed out that the results of this election have more deeply educated the Italian people, making them see through the US imperialists' ambition to enslave and the De Gasperi clique's betrayal, while also inspiring the People's Democratic Front to further deepen and broaden its ties with the people and strengthen its own unity in order to guide the Italian people to wage a more intense struggle against US imperialism and the domestic reactionary camp for the cause of independence and democracy. It can be asserted that the foundation of the Italian reactionaries and their rule will be weakened more than before due to the increasing awareness of the Italian people and the increasingly fierce struggle.
    This week, the French people launched an anti-De Gaulle movement. The resolution of the Central Committee meeting of the French Communist Party on the 16th clearly stated "demanding the immediate organization of a democratic coalition government with the participation of the Communist Party" and taking "dissolving De Gaulle's fascist organization 'Rally of the French People'" as one of its basic political programs. The French people have keenly discerned and are vigilant against De Gaulle and other US imperialist lackeys' anti-communist and anti-people conspiracies. Therefore, when De Gaulle attended the first gathering of traitors of the "Rally of the French People" in Marseille, the city immediately erupted with a mass demonstration of 60,000 workers, with the masses pointing to De Gaulle as a "traitor to the revival movement," and the roar of "thwarting the reactionary plot" finally drowned out De Gaulle's anti-Soviet and anti-communist ravings. Every slogan of the Marseille masses' demonstration is a reflection of the will of the entire French people. The development of the anti-De Gaulle movement is one of the noteworthy trends in the French political situation in the future.
    The domestic movement for peace and democracy in the United States continues to flourish. After the House Un-American Activities Committee put forward a reactionary bill to persecute the American Communist Party and democratic forces, it further aroused the upsurge of the American people's movement. The Central Committee of the American Communist Party has severely condemned this move by the American imperialists, aimed at abandoning "the democratic principles embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights" under the pretext of anti-communism. In the past week, the "Students for Wallace Committee" held a large demonstration of 70,000 students, strongly opposing Truman's conscription and universal military training law. At the same time, the broad masses of the American people have also risen up and joined the "Wallace movement" in response to the American authorities' reactionary domestic and foreign policies. In California alone, 500,000 people have nominated Wallace as a presidential candidate.
    Exciting news has again come from the Far East people's movement for independence and liberation. Democratic parties and groups from North and South Korea have gathered in Pyongyang to discuss countermeasures to defeat the South Korean puppet election. This meeting not only symbolizes the great unity of the North and South Korean people but is also the key to accelerating the realization of an independent and unified Korea. The Indonesian people's anti-US and anti-Dutch struggle is advancing along the correct path. An armed uprising against the Dutch has erupted in Java, and the people's armed forces have severely damaged the Dutch invading army in Cikampek, West Java. At the same time, the influence of the Indonesian People's Democratic Front has also penetrated into the enemy-occupied areas of Java and the outer islands. In Vietnam, the activities of the Viet Minh guerrillas have approached the heartland of French imperialist rule in Vietnam—the Saigon-Cholon area. The sound of gunfire from the Viet Minh attacking forces has forced the French-Vietnamese reactionaries, who are frightened every night, to hastily announce the early implementation of martial law. The struggle of Japanese workers, under the barbaric suppression of MacArthur, is still rising one after another. The general strike of 75,000 miners has demonstrated the Japanese workers' indomitable and persistent fighting spirit.

### 希腊反动派正准备逃亡  法国开展反戴高乐运动

    希腊反动派正准备逃亡
    法国开展反戴高乐运动
    希腊民主军一周来不断扩大辉煌战果。除在若干地区彻底粉碎由美英直接指挥下的希伪军攻势外，并在各线发动强大进攻。连战皆捷，先后解放希腊中、南、北部三个城市和广大地区以及摩里亚半岛之卡拉夫鲁塔等敌重要据点；同时，攻势矛头已直逼雅黄近郊，使索福利斯小王朝陷于四面楚歌之境。反动派现除急急忙忙的动员匪巢雅典全部军警，妄图作困兽之斗外，并已赶紧作逃亡的准备。与急派特别委员会至开俄斯岛布置“善后”事务同时，希伪政府总理索福利斯十九日谈虎色变似的惊呼：“国内局势不久或将大大恶化，政府可能疏散到其他城市。”
    本周意大利大选已经揭晓，人民民主阵线赢得了政治上的重大胜利。意大利这次大选，是在极不民主与极不自由的情形下进行的。在大选前及大选进程中，由于美、英、法帝国主义及梵蒂冈等实行了疯狂的联合干涉，并与加斯贝利反动阵营串通一气，施尽舞弊、恫吓、利诱、强迫、欺诈等卑鄙手段。意共领袖托格里亚蒂在揭露伪选丑态时说：“其横蛮情形是任何一个近代国家所找不到的”。但选举结果，即使根据反动政府公布的数字，人民民主阵线仍获得全国百分之三十一以上的八百万选民的热烈拥护，共和党等反动党派则遭受了惨败。这证明：“人民民主阵线已在全国获得了政治上强有力的支持，意反动派要把人民民主阵线从广大人民大众中孤立起来的计划，已经失败”（团结报）。同时必须指出：这次选举的结果，已更深刻地教育了意大利人民，使他们看透了美帝国主义的奴役野心与加斯贝利之流的卖身投靠，同时亦激励了人民民主阵线今后更加深入和广泛的去联系人民和加强本身的团结，以引导意国人民为独立民主事业对美帝国主义和国内反动阵营进行更猛烈的斗争。可以断言，意国反动派及统治基础将因意国人民的日益觉悟与斗争日益激烈而较前更为削弱。
    本周法国人民掀起反戴高乐运动，法共中委会十六日会议决议中，已明确提出“要求立即组织有共产党参加的民主联合政府”，并把“解散戴高乐的法西斯组织‘法国人民联盟’”，作为它的基本政纲之一。法国人民已洞烛并警惕戴高乐等美帝走卒反共反人民奸计，因此，当戴高乐出席马赛“法国人民联盟”首届群奸大会时，该城遂即爆发了六万劳动人民的反戴大示威，群众指戴高乐为“复兴运动的叛徒”，而“阻遏反动派计划”的怒吼声，终于掩盖了戴氏之反苏反共狂吠，马赛群众示威时的每一口号，乃是全法民意的体现。反对戴高乐运动的展开，是今后法国政局值得注意的动向之一。
    美国国内保卫和平，民主运动继续蓬勃开展，美众院非美活动委员会提出迫害美共及民主势力的反动法案后，更激起美国人民运动的高涨。美共中委会曾痛斥美帝此举，旨在以反共为名，实则妄图抛弃“独立宣言及权利法案所体现的民主原则”。一周来，“拥护华莱士学生委员会”举行了七万学生的大示威，强烈反对杜鲁门征兵与普遍军训法。同时，美国广大人民亦奋起卷入“华莱士运动”，以回答美国当局反动的内外政策，仅加里福尼亚一州，推举华莱士为总统候选人的就达五十万人。
    远东人民独立解放运动，又传来令人兴奋的消息。南北鲜民主党派团体已在平壤集会。商讨击溃南鲜伪选之对策。这一会议不仅象征着南北鲜人民的大团结，而且也是加速实现独立统一朝鲜的关键。印尼人民反美荷斗争，正沿着正确的路线前进，在爪哇已爆发人民反荷武装起义，人民武装曾重创西部爪哇新埔头荷侵略军。同时，印尼人民民主阵线势力亦已渗透至爪哇及外岛敌占区。在越南，越盟游击队的活动已进逼法帝统治越南之心脏地区——西贡堤岸周围。越盟攻击部队的枪炮声，迫使一夜数惊的法越反动派，仓惶宣布提早实施戒严令。日本工人的斗争，在麦克阿瑟野蛮镇压下，仍此起彼伏。七万五千矿工的总罢工，已表现了日本工人不屈不挠再接再厉的斗志。
