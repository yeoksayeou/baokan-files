    Tian Erzhuang Zhao Zhuang New Farmers' Association Returns Confiscated Landlords' Shops

    To the Editors of the People's Daily:

    Having seen in the newspaper that in the ninth district of Wu'an, Tian Erzhuang, there is a landlord who is also a businessman, it must be me. I think the class designation was discussed by the whole village, so it must be accurate. I started my business apprenticeship in Handan at the age of fourteen and have continued to run my business since the liberation of Handan. Until the last movement last year, when my business was taken over by the village, I was still working at the counter. I think labor can transform people quickly. What method can I use to transform my identity as a businessman landlord? I hope you can give me a clear direction so that I can transform my class status.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yang Li

    Mr. Yang Li of Handan: We received your letter, in which you mentioned that your business was taken over by the village during the mass movement last year. This involves the industrial and commercial policy of the democratic government. This newspaper immediately sent a reporter to your village (Tian Erzhuang) to inquire about how to handle this issue in the investigation. Yang Zhuzi, the newly elected village head of Tian Erzhuang, and Yang Linsheng, a member of the Farmers' Association, told the reporter: "It has been decided to return Yang Li's business to him (including the capital and the house). Ting Suo, the manager of our village's cooperative, and the person who runs the business jointly in Zhao Zhuang, have gone to Handan to clear the formalities and have been gone for three days." They said: This is the policy of the government, and it should be resolutely implemented. What should be returned to others should be returned to them. At the same time, the reporter also explained to your family the policy of the democratic government to protect industry and commerce. Your mother was very satisfied with the village's handling and immediately expressed that she would work hard in the future and said that she would call back your third younger brother who had fled to help you run the business. The policy of the democratic government to protect industry and commerce is firm. Even the industry and commerce of landlords are not allowed to be infringed upon and confiscated. Article 12 of the Land Law Outline clearly stipulates: The property of industrialists and businessmen and their legitimate businesses shall be protected from infringement. This year, the Handan Municipal Government has also issued several proclamations on concrete measures to protect industry and commerce and prosper the economy. Therefore, although your personal family status is landlord, your industrial and commercial part is resolutely not to be struggled against and will be protected and supported by the democratic government. Now that your business has been returned to you, we hope that you will eliminate all doubts, let go and expand your business, and strive to develop production and prosper the economy, which is your contribution to the people. If the capital is insufficient, you can still get low-interest or interest-free loans from the government. As for your class status, according to the classification regulations: "Landlords who have transferred to labor or other class statuses for five years after the establishment of the local democratic government should change their class status and treatment according to the changed situation." In your case, after your family stops exploiting for five years, your class status can be changed according to your actual situation.

    田二庄赵庄新农会退还没收地主的商店人民日报编辑同志：
    见报载武安九区田二庄划成份有地主兼商业一家，一定是我，我想划成份是全村讨论，一定是划不错的。我自幼十四岁在邯学生意，一直到解放邯郸后，我的买卖继续经营，顶到去年最后运动，我的买卖归村接收后，我还在柜服务，我想劳动能转变的快，我这商人地主想转变可用啥法子？希指我一条明路，好来转变我的成份。　　　　　　　　　
　　杨理
    邯郸杨理先生：接到你的来信，其中提到你的买卖在去年群运中被村里接收，这涉及民主政府的工商业政策，本报当即派记者到你村（田二庄）访问，在填补中对这问题如何处理。田二庄新选村长杨珠子和农会委员杨林生告诉记者说：“杨理的生意已决定退还给他（资本房子都在内），俺村合作社经理廷锁和赵庄合伙经营的人，一起到邯郸去清理手续已走了三天。”他们说：这是政府的政策，自然应该坚决执行，该退人家就退人家。同时记者并向你家人解释民主政府保护工商业政策，你母亲对村里的处理非常满意，立即表示以后要好好动弹，并说要把你逃亡在外的三弟叫回来帮你经营商业。民主政府保护工商业的政策是坚决的，即使是地主的工商业也同样不准侵犯没收，土地法大纲第十二条明白规定：保护工商业者的财产及其合法的营业，不受侵犯。邯郸市府今年也曾数次布告保护工商业繁荣经济的具体办法。所以，虽然你本人家庭成份是地主，但你的工商业部分是坚决不斗，并且要受到民主政府的保护和扶持。现在你的生意已经退还给你，希望你消除一切疑虑，放手扩大经营，能够为发展生产繁荣经济而努力，就是你对人民的贡献。如资本不足，尚可得到政府低利或无利贷款扶助。至于你的成份，按划阶级规定：“地主在当地民主政权成立以后，已经转入劳动或其他成份满五年者，应依转变后的情况改变其成份及待遇”。就你的情况说，则在你家庭停止剥削满五年后，即可按你实际情况改变成份。
