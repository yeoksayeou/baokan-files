　　Chiang Currency Plummets Again
  　Devaluation of 100 Percent in Thirty Days
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd] Foreign news agency reports: On the 20th, the Chiang currency plummeted again on the Shanghai black market. The U.S. dollar rose to 750,000 Chiang currency per dollar, and gold reached 45 million Chiang currency per tael. The semi-official American Associated Press also acknowledged: "A good practical rule of thumb for measuring inflation in China (referring to the Chiang bandit regime) is that the legal tender (referring to the Chiang currency) devalues by 100 percent every sixty days, and recently, it has been devaluing by 100 percent every thirty days."

    【新华社陕北二十二日电】外国通讯社消息：二十日上海黑市蒋币又惨跌，美钞每元涨达七十五万，黄金每两四千五百万元。美国半官方的美联社也承认：“测度中国（指蒋匪）通货膨胀的一个良好的实际法则，就是法币（指蒋币），每隔六十天贬值百分之百，而在近来，则是三十天贬值百分之百。”
