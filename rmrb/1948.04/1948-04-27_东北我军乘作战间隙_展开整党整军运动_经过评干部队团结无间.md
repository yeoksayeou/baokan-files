Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army (PLA) units, during breaks in combat, have launched a Party consolidation and military rectification movement, fully promoting democracy, mobilizing soldiers to evaluate cadres, and achieving the goals of improving work, transforming work styles, and consolidating internal unity. Before the cadre evaluation began, some cadres had two concerns: one was the fear of lowering their prestige, and the other was the fear that the troops would be unmanageable afterwards. Therefore, cadres had to be mobilized first to clear their minds, and then discussions were held from cadres to soldiers, from the general meetings to the squad and platoon level. When mobilizing cadres in one unit, emphasis was placed on the need for cadres to humbly accept the opinions of soldiers and not to suppress democracy; soldiers were told that giving cadres suggestions was to help them and to ensure that cadres would not retaliate. Many soldiers said in the discussions: "If the main beam is not straight, the secondary beams will be crooked. If the cadres have problems, we will also lag behind. This time we must give good suggestions." "The suggestions should be in accordance with the facts, don't exaggerate a bean-sized matter into a millstone-sized one." The cadres of each company also expressed their attitudes at the general meetings of soldiers, welcoming criticism to dig out bad roots. After the mobilization matured, each company held a democratic meeting, and the soldiers gave many suggestions to the cadres. Soldiers of the second platoon of the second company of a certain unit gave the platoon leader the following suggestions: "The platoon leader is not patient in management and education, always saying that the fourth and sixth squads are not good, only the fifth squad is good. Why don't you try to make everyone good? The platoon leader should not treat soldiers differently." Soldiers of the fifth company gave the company commander the following suggestions: "The company commander is unreasonable, and wanted to beat the health clinic in a certain place. He insisted that the soldiers were pretending to be sick when they were sick and didn't give them food. When he has a minor illness, he makes pancakes and soup, and his life is relatively loose. We hope the company commander will change." After the suggestions were made, the cadres reflected on themselves to everyone, focusing on examining themselves, connecting their own problems with ideological work, explaining how to correct them, and expressing their determination to correct them. Then, the soldiers were asked to discuss whether the cadres' self-examination was thorough. Soldiers of the sixth company of a certain unit proposed: "The company commander once scolded the local people and tied them up and sent them to the farmers' association. He didn't reflect on this. This should not only be reflected on in the company, but also an apology should be made to the local people!" Cadres who did not reflect thoroughly made a second self-examination after being pointed out by the soldiers. Therefore, the soldiers were very satisfied with the cadre evaluation, and they said: "The cadres have all reflected on their mistakes and want to correct them, we can't be rascals, we have to work hard!" Currently, each company is brewing a campaign to respect cadres and cherish soldiers on this basis. After the cadre evaluation, each unit has made significant progress. Liu Jingquan, the platoon leader of the machine gun company of a certain battalion, decided to correct his mistakes after the cadre evaluation. He often helped soldiers carry ammunition boxes during marches, and was very patient in educating soldiers. The soldiers happily said: "Our platoon leader has really changed." Wu Zhicheng, the platoon leader of the second company of a certain regiment, used to be hardworking, caring for soldiers, and sleeping on the ground himself, letting the soldiers sleep on the heated kang when arriving at the camp. After the cadre evaluation, the soldiers felt that the platoon leader was too good, and they would not let him sleep on the ground during marches and camps in the future, and they automatically proposed: "We must consciously abide by discipline, work actively, and not let the platoon leader worry too much." After the cadre evaluation, the soldiers of the ninth company also examined their past mistakes such as making strange remarks, not studying hard, and violating discipline, and formulated a convention to respect cadres. Therefore, the relationship between officers and soldiers in the troops has been greatly improved, and all kinds of work have been improved a step further.

    东北我军乘作战间隙
    展开整党整军运动
    经过评干部队团结无间
    【新华社东北二十五日电】东北解放军各部在作战间隙中展开整党整军运动，充分发扬民主，发动战士评论干部，达到改进工作，转变作风，巩固内部团结的目的。评干开始前，有些干部存在着两种顾虑：一是怕降低自己威信，另一是怕以后部队无法管理，故须首先对干部进行动员，打通思想，然后从干部到战士，从军人大会到班排酝酿讨论。某部在进行动员时，对干部强调提出要虚心接受战士意见，不许压制民主；对战士则说明给干部提意见是帮助干部，保证干部不报复。许多战士们在讨论中说：“大梁不正二梁歪，干部有毛病，我们也会跟着落后，这回要好好提意见。”“提意见要合乎事实，不要把黄豆大的事说成磨盘大。”各连干部也纷纷在军人大会上表示自己的态度，欢迎批评挖坏根。动员成熟后，各连即召开民主大会，战士们均对干部提了很多意见。某部二连二排战士给排长提意见说：“排长管理教育不耐心，总说四、六班不好，只有五班好，你为什么不想法叫大家都好呢？排长对战士不应该有两样看待。”五连战士给连长提意见说：“连长蛮不讲理，在某地要打卫生所。战士有病硬说是装的，不给饭吃，自己有点小病就烙饼，又做汤，生活也比较散漫，希望连长改掉。”意见提完以后，干部即向大家进行反省，着重检讨自己，把自己的毛病和思想工作联系起来，说明如何改正以及表示改正的决心。然后又让战士们讨论，看干部反省彻底不彻底。某部六连战士提出说：“连长有一次骂了老乡，还把老乡捆起来送到农会，没反省出来，这不但应该在连里反省，还得向老乡去道歉呢！”反省不彻底的干部，经战士指出后又作了第二次反省，因此战士们对评干很满意，他们说：“干部都反省了要改正错误，咱们可不能要赖皮，得好好干！”现各连正在这个基础上酝酿展开尊干爱兵运动。各部经过评干以后，都有显著进步，某营机枪连排长刘景全在评干后决心改正错误，在行军中常帮战士扛子弹箱，对战士教育也非常耐心，战士们都高兴的说：“咱们排长真转变了。”某团二连排长吴志成过去一贯吃苦耐劳，爱护战士，到了宿营地自己睡地下，让战士睡炕上，经过评干后，战士们觉得排长太好了，以后行军宿营怎么也不叫他地下睡，并且自动提出：“咱们要自觉遵守纪律，积极工作，不要再让排长多操心了。”九连战士在评干后也检讨了自己过去讲怪话，不好好学习和犯纪律等错误，并且订出尊干公约，因此部队中官兵关系大大改善，各种工作都提高了一步。
