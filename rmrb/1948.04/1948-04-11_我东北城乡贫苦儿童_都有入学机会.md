　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th. In the Northeast liberated areas, out-of-school children in urban and rural areas and the children of emancipated peasants have gained the opportunity to enjoy education. Primary schools in Harbin have expanded their classes. In the Songpu District of Harbin's suburbs, the Machuankou Primary School, due to the large number of out-of-school children in the area, mobilized all teachers and students to go deep into each household to encourage out-of-school children to attend school. The school provides subsidies for their textbook fees, and during the busy farming season, it organizes labor exchange teams to help families with production. Primary schools in Qiqihar have adopted methods such as half-day schools and night schools to facilitate poor students' ability to both study and help with household production. Currently, a total of 11,620 children have enrolled in the city, an increase of more than 2,340 compared to last year. The Central District of Andong City has also established night schools for out-of-school children, with more than 500 students, many of whom are children who sell peanuts, melon seeds, and cigarettes. They do business during the day and study at night, and their enthusiasm is extremely high. In various parts of Liuhe County, Liaoning Province, after the peasants distributed the land equally, they all sent their children to school. Children who used to herd cattle and pigs are now carrying schoolbags and skipping and jumping to school. On average, more than 90% of the children of school age in each street and village in the Fourth District of the county have enrolled in school. In Wudaogou Street, there are a total of 139 school-age children, and 120 have enrolled. In order to facilitate the schooling of children from various villages, the urban and rural primary schools in the county have established a branch school. Only two days after the opening of the school, more than 60 people had registered. In Jiaohe and Dunhua Counties, Jilin Province, students are launching production competitions in their studies to achieve a better combination of learning and production.

　　我东北城乡贫苦儿童
  　都有入学机会
    【新华社东北九日电】东北解放区各城乡失学儿童与翻身农民子弟获得享受教育机会。哈尔滨市各小学已扩充班次。该市市郊松浦区马船口小学以该区失学儿童较多，曾发动全校员生深入各户动员失学儿童上学，由校方补助其书籍费，农忙时期则组织变工小组，帮助家庭生产。齐齐哈尔市各小学采取半日学校、夜校等方式，以便利贫苦学生一面就学，一面帮助家中生产。现该市已报名入学的儿童共一万一千六百二十余人，较去年增加两千三百四十余人。安东市中央区也成立了失学儿童夜校，学生达五百余人，其中很多是卖花生、瓜子、烟卷的儿童，他们白天做买卖，晚上学习，情绪极高。辽宁柳河县各地农民在平分土地后均纷纷送子弟上学，过去牧牛牧猪的小孩，现在都背着书包跳跳蹦蹦上学校，该县四区各街屯平均已入学之儿童占百分之九十以上。五道沟街共有学龄儿童一百三十九名，入学者达一百二十人。该县城区与农村小学为便利各村儿童上学，特设立分校一所，开学仅两天，报名者即达六十余名。吉林蛟河、敦化各县学生均在学习中展开生产比赛，使学习与生产求得更好结合。
