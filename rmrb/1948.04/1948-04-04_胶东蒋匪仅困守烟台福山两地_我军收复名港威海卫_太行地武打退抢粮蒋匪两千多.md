Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd: The Jiaodong People's Liberation Army recovered the famous naval port of Weihaiwei on the 30th of last month. The defending bandits, including the direct subordinate team of the 166th Brigade of the 8th Division of the entire 8th Army, and the 496th and 497th Regiments of the brigade, as well as personnel from the puppet municipal government, fled by ship at dawn on the 30th. The city was completely recovered by our troops who persisted in fighting in the original location. The Jiang bandits now trapped in Yantai and Fushan along the Beihai coast are even more isolated and panic-stricken.

This newspaper, Taihang, 31st: The local troops in Taihang have won consecutive victories in attacks on both the east and west lines. At dawn on the 27th, two companies of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the 27th Division of the Yan bandit stationed in Nantuanbai, Qixian County, went to Zhongliang Village to loot grain and conscript men. Before they could gain a foothold after entering the village, they were ambushed by our Qixian Independent Battalion. When the enemy saw our ambush, they ran away, but were blocked and severely beaten by our troops. In the 40-minute battle, eight enemies were killed or wounded, 14 were captured alive, one machine gun, one small cannon, seven rifles, more than 400 rounds of ammunition, 26 hand grenades, and two machine gun barrels were seized. In addition, the Huixian Battalion of our 5th Military Sub-district also defeated the grain-looting enemies from Jiaozuo and Xiuwu twice. On the 24th of this month, more than 2,000 Jiang bandits from the 40th Division stationed in Jiaozuo and the Xiuwu Security Team attempted to loot grain in Baobi Town, Huixian County, but were intercepted by our Huixian Battalion. The enemy suffered more than 20 casualties and retreated to their original location in a panic. At 5:00 a.m. on the 28th, more than 400 members of the Xiuwu Jiang bandit security team went to Wucun, more than 20 li north of the city, to loot grain and conscript men. They were severely attacked by our Huixian Battalion again. The enemy suffered more than 20 casualties, one person was captured, and five rifles, more than 300 rounds of ammunition, one machine gun barrel, and 15 bombs were seized. (Attached picture)
