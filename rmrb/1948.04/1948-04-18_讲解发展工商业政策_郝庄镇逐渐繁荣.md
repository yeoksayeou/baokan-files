　　Explaining the Policy of Developing Industry and Commerce
  　Haozhuang Town Gradually Prospers
    [Lincheng News] In Haozhuang Town, Fifth District, after explaining the industrial and commercial policy, most merchants eliminated their previous fear of large-scale operations. The industrial operations within the mutual aid teams in each street have also been reorganized, allowing them to operate privately on a voluntary basis, and appropriately stipulating wage and profit-sharing systems (mutually beneficial). The masses of Haozhuang Village were also educated to protect the market and not to deceive outsiders. Now, Haozhuang Village has established a new steamed bun shop. Mi Erwai and several others have opened a store. Zhao Dongming, who built a new house, has also opened a restaurant. Some people are engaged in mountain lending, eggs, small sundry goods, and other businesses (a total of more than twenty households). More merchants from various places come here to the market, and the masses feel that they have everything they need to buy, and the market is larger than last year.

　　讲解发展工商业政策
  　郝庄镇逐渐繁荣
    【临城消息】五区郝庄镇，自从讲解了工商业政策后，大部商人消除了过去不敢大干的想法。各街互助队内有经营工业的，也进行了整理，听其自愿私营，适当的规定了工资及分红制度（互不吃亏）。并教育了郝庄村的群众，对市场要爱护，不要欺外。现在郝庄村新设馍馍坊一座，米二歪等几个人开了座店房，新盖房子的赵冬明也开饭铺了，有些人则经营起山贷、鸡蛋、碎杂货等不少的买卖（共二十多户），各地商贩到这里赶集的也多了，群众感到买什么也不缺了，市场比去年大了。
