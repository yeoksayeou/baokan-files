Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. New York dispatch: On the second day (May 5th) of the anti-Chiang "China Week," mass demonstrations were held in major cities across the United States. The New York demonstration took place at noon on the 5th in the open-air square in the heart of New York, amidst the roar of the masses demanding "Get Out of China!" Banners emblazoned with slogans such as "No Weapons for Chiang Kai-shek!" and "U.S. Troops Get Out of China!" fluttered in the wind throughout the venue. Stewards patrolled to maintain order. Participants read pamphlets protesting Truman's aid to Chiang in the civil war, filled with righteous indignation against Truman's reactionary policy of interfering in China's internal affairs. American journalist and friend of the Chinese people, Ms. Smedley, delivered a mobilizing speech at the meeting, vehemently criticizing the "China (Chiang) government as being a fascist government ruled by warlords, just like Franco's government in Spain." She angrily denounced Truman's aid to Chiang, saying, "American money is being used to massacre the Chinese people, thus causing chaos in China." The Chiang bandit Central News Agency "reporter" went to the venue to gather information. When he produced his Central News Agency "reporter" ID, Smedley immediately shouted that this was a "Kuomintang secret agent," and the attending masses immediately burst into boos, scaring the "reporter" to the point of turning pale, ashamed and crestfallen.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. New York dispatch: The "China Week" against Truman's aid to Chiang, initiated by the Democratic Far East Policy Committee, began on the 4th. The committee will soon send a petition to Truman, Marshall, and Congress, and launch a widespread signature campaign for the petition. The petition states: "We demand that U.S. troops withdraw from China. Since the victory over Japan, the United States has provided Chiang Kai-shek with loans, weapons, and military services worth more than five billion U.S. dollars. These have all been used to wage a civil war against the Chinese people. We urge that no loans and weapons be given to China (Chiang), that personnel training and serving as military advisors be withdrawn; that the Chinese people be allowed to solve their own problems; and that the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people be restored." The Democratic Far East Policy Committee declared on the 4th: "'China Week' is just the beginning of our struggle to obtain a foreign policy that truly represents the will of the American people." It is reported that mass rallies against the Chiang government and American aid to Chiang's policies are scheduled to be held successively in various parts of the United States from the 5th.

　　全美各大城市群众示威
  　怒吼不给蒋介石武器
    蒋匪“记者”吓得面如土色无地自容
    【新华社陕北七日电】纽约讯：反对援蒋“中国周”第二天（五日），全美各大城市纷纷召开示威大会，纽约示威大会五日中午于群众“退出中国”的怒吼声中，在纽约中心区露天广场举行。上书“不给蒋介石武器！”“美军退出中国！”等口号的旗帜，在会场到处迎风飘扬，纠察队来往巡行维持秩序，与会者朗读着抗议杜鲁门援蒋内战的小册子，对杜鲁门干涉中国内政的反动政策，满怀义愤。美名记者、中国人民的友人斯沫特莱女士在会上发表动员演讲，猛烈抨击“中国（蒋）政府与西班牙的佛朗哥政府一样，是军阀所统治的法西斯政府”。她怒斥杜鲁门援蒋说：“美国的金钱都被用来屠杀中国人民，因而造成了中国的混乱”。蒋匪中央社“记者”曾赴会场刺探，当其拿出中央社“记者”证时，史沫特莱即高呼这是“国民党的特务”，到会群众立即发出一片嘘声，吓得该“记者”面呈土色无地自容。
    【新华社陕北六日电】纽约讯：民主远东政策委员会所发起的反对杜鲁门援蒋“中国周”，已于四日开始。该会即将以请愿书一件致送杜鲁门、马歇尔及国会，并发起对该书的广泛签名运动。该书声称：“我们要求美军撤出中国。自对日胜利以来，美国给蒋介石之贷款、武器和军事服务，价值已达五十余亿美元。这都被用来进行反对中国人民的内战。我们力促不要给中国（蒋）贷款和武器，撤退训练和担任军事顾问的人员；要求让中国人民解决他们自己的问题；并恢复中美人民传统的友谊。”民主远东政策委员会四日宣称：“‘中国周’只是我们争取获得一真正代表美国人民意志的外交政策之开始。”据悉，反对蒋政府和美国援蒋政策的群众大会，定于五日起在全美各地陆续举行。
