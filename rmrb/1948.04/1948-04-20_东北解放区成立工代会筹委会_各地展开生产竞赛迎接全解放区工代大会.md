Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: The Northeast Railway Workers' General Union, the Harbin General Trade Union, and representatives from various mining unions held a joint meeting on the 7th. They discussed responding to Comrade Liu Ningyi's call and preparing to participate in the All-Liberated Area Trade Union Congress, and initiated the establishment of a preparatory committee for the Northeast Liberated Area Trade Union Congress. On the 12th of this month, the preparatory committee issued a circular to the general trade unions of various provinces in Northeast China and to industrial unions in various regions, proposing that the Northeast Liberated Area Trade Union Congress be held concurrently with the opening of the All-Liberated Area Trade Union Congress to establish the trade union of the Northeast Liberated Area, and to discuss the major issues facing the working class raised by Comrade Liu Ningyi, especially the specific methods for realizing Chairman Mao's instructions on developing production, prospering the economy, giving consideration to both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital. The circular also called on trade unions in various regions to organize in-depth study and discussion of Comrade Liu Ningyi's circular, immediately prepare for the election of representatives, with one representative elected for every two thousand workers. Enterprises or trade unions with more than one thousand but less than two thousand people can also elect one representative. All representatives must be elected by the masses of workers and staff; they cannot be appointed by higher-level trade unions. Where general trade unions or trade unions have been established, it is best to convene a congress of workers' representatives to elect outstanding members of the working class, labor heroes who have contributed to the cause of people's liberation, model workers, and leaders loved by the workers as representatives. Finally, it called on trade unions and industrial unions in various regions, as well as all workers, to immediately mobilize in earnest, to greet the All-Liberated Area Workers' Representative Congress and the Northeast Liberated Area Workers' Representative Congress with practical actions of intensifying production and launching a meritorious service competition movement.
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: The Harbin General Trade Union recently sent a letter to Liu Ningyi, representing 100,000 workers in Harbin, expressing heartfelt support and warm welcome to the All-Liberated Area Workers' Representative Congress to be held in Harbin on June 10th, and requesting him to extend greetings and congratulations to the brotherly representatives of various liberated areas. The letter stated: "We are now busily preparing for the second Harbin Workers' Representative Congress. More than 400 representatives will gather on May Day to summarize the work of the past year, unite the strength of the working people of Harbin, and mobilize for greater production to support the liberation war in Northeast China and the whole country, and to build a prosperous Harbin. We, the 400,000 workers and their families in Harbin, are determined to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions and the call of the Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Areas Federation of Trade Unions, to develop production, prosper the economy, give consideration to both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital. We will definitely elect our own representatives to participate in this All-Liberated Area Workers' Representative Congress, and together with the worker brothers of the entire liberated area, make the congress a united and victorious success."
