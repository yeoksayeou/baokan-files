Xinhua News Agency, Yushan'e Front, 11th: The People's Liberation Army, advancing on the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, recaptured the strategically important town of Luohe on the 9th, and simultaneously liberated the county seat of Yancheng. The defending enemy forces fled in panic to the southeast.

Xinhua News Agency, Yushan'e Front, 11th: The Luoyang-advancing People's Liberation Army liberated Rongyang County, 60 li west of Zhengzhou, on the night of the 9th. The defending local Chiang bandits fled eastward. Thus, we now control over 400 li of the Longhai Railway, from Mianchi in the west to Rongyang and Zhengzhou in the east.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 11th: The Sui-Meng local armed forces captured Qingshuihe County in southern Sui during the night of the 8th, annihilating over 200 of Fu Zuoyi's bandit troops defending the city. The remaining enemy fled towards Tokto.

Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Cha-Re-Liao, 12th: A widespread conscription movement is being launched in various parts of Ji-Cha-Re-Liao. According to incomplete statistics from Zhangbei, Huairou, Beipiao and other places, over 6,000 young and strong men have joined the army. The most important feature of the conscription movement is that district and village cadres form the core and take the lead. The participants are mostly liberated peasants, and the masses in guerrilla areas and enemy-occupied areas are also coming to join in droves because they cannot bear the Kuomintang puppet's oppression. In Zhangbei, since the end of March and the beginning of April, more than 200 people have voluntarily applied to enlist. In one district, ten cadres from five villages personally took the lead in joining the army. In Huairou County, 1,300 people enlisted in four districts in the first few days. Beipiao quickly had 500 young people sign up. After exchanging land reform experiences, the Huairou County Peasants' Congress made it clear that "After overthrowing little Chiang Kai-shek (landlords), we must also overthrow big Chiang Kai-shek," and immediately launched a conscription movement. Many male and female village cadres signed up their husbands and sons. Villagers in Tenth Village, a guerrilla area in Duolun, had long harbored resentment after being ravaged by Fu Zuoyi's bandits and having their young men seized. When our armed work team arrived, the village spontaneously organized a platoon to join the army.
