　　【Taihang News】After publicizing the Land Law and the Border Region Government's announcement of "whoever plants, harvests," the chaotic situation among various classes in Yushe, Xingtai, Shexian, Zuoquan, Licheng, Pingshun and other counties has gradually been overcome. In addition to actively organizing activities such as delivering manure, repairing land, and collecting firewood, and consolidating mutual aid in preparation for spring plowing, the leadership has further paid attention to solving the production difficulties of the masses (especially poor and landless peasants), and is now preparing for sowing. The following methods have been adopted to solve the difficulties: One method is to lend the unallocated land and grain from the land reform, as well as public land and granary grain, to the poorest peasants with the greatest production difficulties. The land use right is temporarily determined, but the ownership is not determined. Chongzuan Village in Yushe distributed twenty mu of unallocated fruit land and three mu of community land to poor peasant Yue Ergou and three households with less land. Two shi and eight dou of granary grain were used to relieve the four households who had no food at the time. A loan of 50,000 yuan was also re-loaned to poor households. 50,000 yuan of fruit money was given to women to solve the difficulties of textile tools. After research by the Spring Plowing Committee, Beiquangou distributed more than 31 mu of fruit land and a donkey to six poor peasant households. Fangjiapu in Xingtai put forward the slogan of not abandoning one mu of land. After discussion by the Farmers' Association, 19 mu of fruit land were lent to 15 poor peasant households and 5 lower-middle peasant households. The second method is: cooperative assistance and loan issuance. After the Guozhuang Cooperative in Shexian investigated the difficulties of the masses in seeds and farm tools, it immediately sent people to Zuoquan and Wu'an Yangyi to buy back 38 jin of cotton seeds and farm tools, which were sold to farmers at the original price. The most active and effective method is the third method, because middle and poor peasants broke the mentality of "equal distribution" and "fear of disrupting equal distribution," established the idea of family unity and mutual assistance in production. After preliminary consolidation of mutual aid, relying on the natural conditions of various places, various kinds of sideline production were generally carried out during the production gaps of manure delivery and land repair, earning money to solve livelihood difficulties. Beishang Village in Zuoquan is a poor village relying on the mountains. All 51 male and female full and semi-laborers in the village wove a total of 304 rakes and 52 dan of baskets in 25 days, earning a total of 686,500 yuan, which solved a great difficulty. The Houchi Village Cooperative in Shexian organized the masses to dig medicinal materials (this place produces Bupleurum, Anemarrhena, Scutellaria, etc.) and purchased them at a price set by the cooperative. In 23 days, 89 people dug more than 1,100 jin of medicinal materials, earning more than 76,000 yuan, which could buy more than 400 jin of millet. Poor peasant Liu Shiyun earned 1,150 yuan in one day, and middle peasant Liu Shijian earned 1,010 yuan in one day.

　　太行各地想办法解决春耕中困难
    【太行消息】榆社、邢台、涉县、左权、黎城、平顺等县，经过宣传土地法，和边府谁种谁收的布告以后，各阶层的混乱现象已逐渐得到克服。除积极组织进行送粪、修地、打柴等和整顿互助春耕准备工作外，领导上并进一步注意解决了群众（特别是贫雇农）的生产困难，现正准备下种。在解决困难中，采取了以下几种办法：一种办法是：把土改中未分配的土地、粮食，和公地、仓谷，借给生产困难最大的贫苦农民，土地是暂时确定使用权，不确定所有权。榆社崇纂村把二十亩没有分配的果实地，三亩社地，分给贫雇岳二苟和三户少地的农民。把二石八斗仓谷救济了当下没吃的四户农民。五万元贷款也转贷给贫苦户。五万元果实款给妇女解决纺织工具困难。北泉沟经过春耕委员会研究，把三十一亩多果实土地和毛驴一头，分给六户贫雇农。邢台放甲铺提出不荒一亩地的口号，经过农会讨论把十九亩果实地借给十五户贫农、五户下中农。第二种办法是：合作社扶助和发放贷款。涉县郭庄合作社调查了群众种籽农具的困难后，马上就派人到左权、武安阳邑买回棉花籽三十八斤，还有农具，照原价卖给农民。最积极有效的是第三种办法，因为中贫农打破了一个等平分、一个怕打乱平分的情绪，建立了一家人的团结互助生产思想，又经初步整顿互助后，在送粪修地等生产空隙中，依靠各地的自然条件，普遍进行各式各样的副业生产，赚下钱解决生活困难。左权背上村是个靠山的穷村，全村五十一个男女全半劳力、廿五天中共编了三百零四扇耢，五十二担箩头，共赚洋六十八万六千五百元，解决了很大的困难。涉县后池村组织群众刨药材（这地方出柴胡、知母、黄芩等）合作社定价收买，廿三天内八十九人共刨药材一千一百多斤，赚洋七万六千多元，能买小米四百多斤。贫农刘士云一天就赚洋一千一百五十元，中农刘士剑一天赚洋一千零一十元。
