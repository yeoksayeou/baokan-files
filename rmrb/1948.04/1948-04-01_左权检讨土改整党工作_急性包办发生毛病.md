Zuoquan Conducts Self-Criticism of Land Reform and Party Rectification Work
　　Hasty and Paternalistic Methods Lead to Problems
[Zuoquan News] In Zuoquan, each district has two pilot villages for implementing land reform. After the work teams arrived in the villages, most of the Poor Peasants' Associations were organized within half a month. Some villages are in the process of establishing peasant representative conferences. The remaining nine-tenths of the villages are concentrating their efforts on production. In order to ensure the smooth progress of these two major tasks, the county convened a meeting of cadres from each district (one person from each district) from March 4th to 10th to study the current situation and methods. In terms of organization and leadership, a specialized, two-track system was adopted. The county extracted specialized personnel to organize a spring plowing guidance committee, and the districts extracted four people to organize spring plowing guidance groups to uniformly lead production work. Each district is carrying out pilot programs in two key villages, relying on cadres reorganized by the district and county committees as the backbone, with seven or eight people per village, to create pilot experiences. Over the past half-month, many deviations have occurred in the work of Party rectification and democratization. In the course of the work, the old organizations were either completely rejected, or Party rectification was carried out behind closed doors without mobilizing the masses. For example, Baoze Village is good example, as it visited poor and hired peasants door-to-door and held meetings of poor and hired peasants to inspire ideological awareness through comparisons of families and histories, and then organized a team. However, there was no good leadership in the Party rectification, and after being rebuffed in two meetings, they were left unattended. The work team only put pressure on the old organization without educating it. They did not distinguish between the masses' opinions about the cadres and accepted them one-sidedly. For example, the problem with the old cadre Shi Minxian, who was a village cadre who had a bad style of taking more fruit, was not very serious. While serving as village cadre, he was once a labor hero. This time, more than ten people privately changed his labor hero plaque to "new local tyrant" (which he was not). However, the comrades of the work team let it go without persuading them, making the party members and cadres feel that they were being treated the same as landlords, and no one was willing to give anyone else advice. The Party rectification was not done well, which also affected the reorganization of the mass organizations. The work team in Shixia Village believed that this village was once an enemy model village in concept, and did not conduct in-depth individual visits when mobilizing the masses. They only looked for poor and hired peasants from the reasonable burden accounts, considering those with grain yields of less than four shi as poor and hired peasants. Some comrades even held democratic testing meetings to find poor and hired peasants (using the method of testing soldiers in the past), and as a result, the masses were not mobilized. The leading comrades of the work team drilled into the branch to carry out Party rectification behind closed doors. Party members shielded each other, and ideological struggles could not be carried out. Later, they realized that something was wrong and changed their approach. The comrades of the Sucheng work team did not conduct in-depth individual visits when organizing the team, but relied on the branch to hand over the list. Without investigating among the masses, they hastily organized the Poor Peasants' Association and "elected" committee members. The masses expressed dissatisfaction. The comrades of the work team did not investigate and study, and then hastily re-examined them. As a result, five of the seven committee members were removed. Some of them were indeed bad, but some were not bad. For example, Li Yinquan was a poor peasant, but he was suspected of having affairs with women and was also removed from his position as a committee member. Guo Fuqi, a poor peasant youth, was also removed from his position and expelled because he wore a fountain pen when he became a committee member. This approach is not only paternalistic but also deprives the masses of their democratic rights. In Yinjiazhuang, the majority of the population are middle peasants, and most of the branch members are middle peasants who are unwilling to offend anyone. After the work team arrived, they did not mobilize the masses well, nor did they rectify the Party well. They organized the Poor Peasants' Association and the Peasants' Association, and elected the political power, the armed committee, and the cooperative committee, creating a set of formalism.
　　The emergence of these problems, in addition to the ideological and work style problems of the work team comrades, is also related to the county's leadership's initial deployment, which required the task to be completed in 20 days, which led to the hasty illness of the work teams in each district. Recently, a review was conducted, and these shortcomings and errors were criticized.

### 左权检讨土改整党工作　急性包办发生毛病

　　左权检讨土改整党工作
  　急性包办发生毛病
    【左权消息】左权每区有两个实验填补的基点村，各区工作团到村后，经半月的时间，大部组织起了贫农团，有些村正成立农代会，其余十分之九的村庄，集中力量生产。为使这两件重大工作能顺利进行，县里于三月四日到十日，召开了各区干部会议（每区一人），研究当前情况与作法。在组织领导上，采取了各专一门、两套组织，县抽出专人组织了春耕指导委员会，区抽出四人组织春耕指导组，统一领导生产工作。各区进行填补两个基点村，依地委、县委整编过的干部为骨干，每村七、八人，创造填补经验。半月来，在整党民主的工作中发生不少偏向，在工作进行中，不是一脚踢开老组织，就是没有发动起群众就去关门整党。如堡则村经过挨门挨户访问贫雇，并召开贫雇会，比家庭、比历史，启发思想自觉，然后组织了队伍，是好的。但没有很好的领导整党，召开两次会碰了钉子，就放下不管了。工作团对老组织光有压力没有教育，对于群众对干部的意见不加分辨，片面接受。比如对老干部史民贤，多占果实作风不好，问题并不十分严重。任村干时曾当过劳动英雄，这次十余个群众，私自将他的劳英牌改为“新恶霸”（其实并非是新恶霸），但工作组同志自流放任，不加说服，使党员干部感到对待他们和对待地主一样，谁也不给谁提意见。整党没整好，也影响了群众队伍的整编。石匣村工作组，观念上认为此村曾经是敌人模范村，在发动群众时没有深入个别访问，只是从合理负担帐上找贫雇，四石产粮以下为贫雇，还有个别同志召开民主测验会找寻贫雇（以过去部队中测验战士方法），结果群众没有发动起来。工作组领导同志钻在支部内关门整党，党员互相包庇，思想斗争不能开展，以后他们发觉不对头才转变过来。粟城工作组同志，在组织队伍时没有深入个别访问，只依靠支部交出名单，未经群众中调查，就粗枝大叶的组织贫农团，并“选出”委员，群众反映不满，工作组同志没有调查研究，就又草率重新审查，结果七个委员审掉五人，其中有些确实是不好的，但有些并不坏，比如李银全是贫农，怀疑人家搞女人，也撤了委员之职。贫农青年郭富奎，因当上委员挂上了一支钢笔，也被撤职，并且开除出去。这种做法不但是包办代替，而且剥夺群众民主权利。殷家庄中农占大多数，支部大部是中农，不愿惹人，工作组到后没有很好发动群众，也没有很好整党，就组织贫农团和农会，并选出政权、武委会、合作委员会，来了一套形式主义。
    这些毛病的产生，除工作组同志思想作风上的毛病外，县的领导开始布置时，要求二十天完成任务，对各区工作组急性病的产生也有关系。最近进行检讨，把这些缺点与错误都作了批评。
