　　Xingtai Production Inspection Team Goes to the Countryside
  　Leading Spring Plowing, Organizing Famine Relief
    Guangping County Government Provides Grain Loans to Relieve Spring Famine
    [Xingtai News] In order to organize and lead disaster-stricken people in production for self-salvation and complete spring plowing, the Xingtai County Government specially organized a (county) Spring Famine Production Inspection Team on March 21st to conduct inspections in areas severely affected by the disaster, in coordination with the districts. It has now gone to disaster-stricken villages in the tenth, fifth, and fourth districts to carry out work, and has decided that the main tasks of the inspection are: (1) to inspect and understand the disaster situation and organize the solution of practical difficulties for the disaster-stricken people, (2) to study and solve the problem of equivalence in mutual aid, and promote agricultural and sideline production and women's textile movement, (3) to report the situation and exchange experiences with small and large newspapers in a timely manner.
    [Further News] The Shipotou base point in Xingtai's fifth district consists of eleven natural villages. According to preliminary investigations, six villages, including Longhua and Baizhuang, are severely affected by the disaster. In Qicun, 24 poor and hired households with 72 people, and 23 middle peasant households with 73 people, are currently without food. In total, 6 villages have registered 84 poor and hired households with 262 people, and 54 middle peasant households with 200 people who currently have no food. By the end of March, 53 poor and hired households with 202 people, and 43 middle peasant households with 161 people will have no food. A total of 234 poor and middle peasant households, with 825 people, currently have no food or will have no food by the end of February. The reasons for the disaster in these villages are: first, there was not enough rain last year, resulting in a poor harvest; and second, the poor and hired peasants have not completely turned themselves around. For example, Hu Lao Xuan, a poor peasant from Qicun with two people in his family, returned from fleeing the famine in Yushe, Shanxi last March, and even caught up with the distribution of fruits, but only received some broken and small items, not even a quilt. Currently, Qicun, Shipotou, and other villages have temporarily lent out five dan and eight dou and five sheng (large dan) of grain stored by military families with no one at home, so that the poor and middle peasants who have no food can borrow it, and they guarantee to return it after the autumn harvest. The government has also allocated loans of 2.4 million yuan. According to the specific conditions of each village, disaster-stricken households are organized to sell firewood, make socks, spin wool, and engage in transportation and other sideline occupations. The masses are also enlightened and educated to engage in production for self-salvation. Luo Xinxing, a poor peasant, said: "If you want to drink hot wine, you have to do it yourself. The main thing to rely on this spring's disaster is to work hard ourselves."

    [Guangping News] Due to last year's floods, half of the villages in the first and second districts of Guangping County suffered disasters. Many people are currently without food and lack enthusiasm for spring plowing, preferring to engage in business to earn some cash for food. If production is not resolved, there will be no way out. For this reason, the county government has approved the allocation of 60,000 jin of relief grain and 26 million yuan in loans to relieve and support poor farmers in spring plowing production. The loans are mainly given to poor farmers in villages severely affected by the disaster. The method is self-reporting and public discussion, based on their needs to solve the problem of production capital, and to promote collective use. Grain is lent to poor farmers and elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households who cannot do business and have no food. The county and district have now organized forces to concentrate on this work. (Zhang Zhendong)

　　邢台生产检查队下乡
  　领导春耕组织渡荒
    广平县府贷粮款救济春荒
    【邢台消息】邢台县府为组织领导灾民生产自救，完成春耕生产，于三月二十一日特组织（县）春荒生产检查队，到灾荒严重的地区，配合区上进行检查。现已分别到十、五、四区等灾村进行工作，并决定检查主要任务是：（一）检查了解灾情，并组织解决灾民的实际困难，（二）研究解决互助中的等价问题，推动开农副业生产与妇女纺织运动，（三）及时与小报大报汇报情况交流经验。
    【又息】邢台五区石坡头基点共十一个自然村，据初步调查，有龙华、白庄等六村灾荒严重；祁村眼下扣锅断顿的贫雇廿四户、七十二口人，中农廿三户、七十三口人。总计六个村登记，眼下已无吃的贫雇八十四户、二百六十二口人，中农五十四户、二百口人，到三月底无吃的贫雇五十三户、二百零二口，中农四十三户、一百六十一口。中贫农当下没吃的和二月底无吃的共二百三十四户、人八百二十五口。这些村造成灾荒的原因，一是去年没落透雨，粮食欠收，二是贫雇没有翻透身。如祁村贫雇胡老玄二口人，去年三月从山西榆社逃荒回来，还赶上分果实，但只分给了些破烂小东西，连被子都没有。现祁村、石坡头等村，已将本村家中无人的军属所存的谷子五石八斗五升（大石）暂时借出，让无吃的贫雇和中农借吃，并保证秋后要还，政府又拨给贷款二百四十万元。根据各村具体条件，组织灾户卖柴，作袜子、纺毛、运输等副业，并又启发教育群众生产自救，贫雇罗新兴说：“想喝热酒，亲自下手，今年春天的灾荒，主要还是靠自己干。”

    【广平消息】广平一、二区因去年水灾，造成半数村庄的灾荒，不少群众现已扣锅绝粮，春耕劲头不大，都愿干个买卖赚点现吃。如不解决生产就没办法。为此本县政府批拨救济粮六万斤，贷款二千六百万元，救济与扶持贫苦农民春耕生产。贷款主要贷给灾荒严重村的贫苦农民，办法是自报公议，根据他需要解决生产资本问题，提倡集体使用。粮食贷给贫苦农民与老弱孤寡不能做买卖的没吃户。现县区已组织力量，集中突击这一工作。　　（张振东）
