　　Spring Ploughing Production Lacks Leadership; The East Camel Base Point is Too Chaotic
    Leaders Should Immediately Inspect and Correct
    [LiCheng News] In the Fifth District's East Camel base point, after convening a meeting of key cadres from nine villages on March 17th to discuss and arrange spring ploughing production, two district cadres were immediately assigned to be specifically responsible for leading the inspection. When the district cadres arrived in the villages, they only focused on resolving the masses' thoughts of waiting for supplementary allocation, but neglected the solution of actual problems in the villages, especially the sabotage and destruction by a few bad elements. This is because many of the poor peasant and farm laborer groups or the elected poor peasant and farm laborer representatives established in the villages last winter were not elected with the consent of genuinely honest poor peasants and farm laborers, but were designated by the cadres. Some were usurped by a few people with hooligan habits and eloquent tongues. These people, in the name of the poor peasants and farm laborers, ruled everything in the village. For example, Li Hong, the "poor peasant representative" of Henan Village, seized great power in the village. Any errands, weddings, funerals, or requests for leave in the village had to go through him. If not, the masses were afraid of problems. Li Xiao-wu, a poor peasant youth and a family member of a soldier, had to have Li Hong's stamp on his document even when he went to the district for his marriage registration this time. He even had to treat Li Hong to a meal; otherwise, he wouldn't dare to get married. Another bamboo mat weaver (originally from Qu Village, She County) asked the village chief for leave to sell mats in another village, but because he didn't ask Li Hong for leave, he was not allowed to go. Cheng Tu-you's mother said: I asked the village chief for leave to go to the city, but because I didn't ask Li Hong for leave, I was not allowed to go, and was even scolded.
    Zhang Li-shun, the political director of Temple Bottom Village, and Wu Feng-tai, the director of the farmers' association, are both poor peasants. They also participated in the poor peasant group last winter. Because they were competing for a woman, they were in conflict with each other and each organized a small clique, causing trouble for each other. The masses were afraid of them and dared not say anything. For example, Zhao Si-ze, the poor peasant representative of Yuanquan, and Cheng Jin-zhu, a poor peasant, organized two factions in conflict with each other because they were competing for a landlord's wife. Village Chief Jiang Qi-yu also participated in the poor peasant group, but dared not make decisions and pushed everything to Zhao Si-ze. For example, distributing shoes, cutting firewood for the families of soldiers, and resolving disputes between families all had to be resolved by the poor peasant representatives. He monopolized everything in the village. After inspection, the above situation was found to be prevalent in all villages. Therefore, the masses reflected: Whoever is in power is powerful, and the poor peasant representatives are even more powerful than the cadres. In this way, the poor peasant representatives in each village monopolize everything, and the main cadres shirk their responsibilities, waiting to step down. Spring ploughing production lacks leadership and is in a state of chaos. The leadership is currently inspecting and correcting the situation, and specifically resolving it.

    Editor's Note:
    Faced with such a chaotic situation, the leadership only says "specifically resolve it," but doesn't know how to resolve it? According to reports from various places, this kind of problem is quite common, and its impact on spring ploughing production is also serious. In places where supplementary allocation is not being carried out, all poor peasant organizations, poor peasant representatives, etc., the leadership should take resolute measures to stop all activities. Even in villages where supplementary allocation is being carried out, the poor peasant leagues are only backbone organizations for the peasant masses to resolutely implement land reform and thoroughly eliminate feudalism, and are not organizations that lead everything. If such a chaotic situation is not resolutely stopped, it will not only affect the current spring ploughing, but also create a misconception among the masses, affecting the smooth progress of future supplementary allocation.

　　春耕生产没人领导  东骆驼基点太混乱
    领导上应马上检查纠正
    【黎城消息】五区东骆驼基点，在三月十七日召开九个村的主要干部会议，讨论布置了春耕生产后，当即抽出两个区干部，专门负责领导检查。区干部到村只注意解决群众等待抽补的思想，但忽视了村中实际问题的解决，特别是少数坏分子的捣乱破坏。因为各村在去冬成立的贫雇小组或选出的贫雇代表，很多的都不是经过真正老实贫雇同意选出的，而是被干部指定，有些是为少数有流氓习气、能说会道的人所篡夺了的。这些人借上贫雇名义，统治村中一切。如河南村“贫雇代表”李宏，在村掌握了大权，凡村上有了差务、结婚、发丧、请假等，都得经过他才能办，如不经过他，群众怕出问题。李小五是一个贫雇青年，又是抗属，这次结婚，到区还得有李宏的手章，还叫李宏吃了一顿饭，不这样就不敢结婚。还有一个编席工人（涉县原曲人），请假去外村卖席子，和村长请好假，但没和李宏请假，就不叫去。程土有母亲说：我和村长请好假去城里，没和李宏请假，不叫去，反而骂了我一顿。
    寺底村政治主任张理顺，农会主任武逢太二人是贫雇，去冬也参加贫雇小组，他二人因争搞一个女人，互相矛盾，各组织一个小集团，互相闹腾，群众怕他不敢吭。如源泉贫雇代表赵四则，和贫雇程金柱，因争一个地主媳妇，组织两派人，互相矛盾。村长江其余也参加贫雇小组，但不敢作主，啥事都推赵四则，如派鞋，给抗属割柴，谁家生气打架，都得找贫雇代表来解决，他包办了村上一切事情。经检查，各村以上情况普遍存在着。所以群众反映：谁掌权谁厉害，贫雇代表比干部还厉害。这样各村贫雇代表包办一切，主要干部推责任，等待下台，春耕生产没人领导，处于混乱状态。领导上现正检查纠正，具体解决。（东骆驼基点工作组建杰、土有、焕河、长顺、华魁）
    编者按：
    象这样混乱情况，领导上只说“具体解决”，但不知如何解决？据各地来稿，这种问题是相当普遍的，它对春耕生产的影响也是严重的。这样不进行抽补的地方，所有贫雇组织，贫雇代表等，领导上应采取坚决措施，一律停止活动。即在进行抽补的村庄、贫农团也只是农民群众坚决实行土地改革彻底消灭封建的骨干组织，也不是领导一切的。这样混乱的情况，如不坚决停止其活动，不但影响当前春耕，且给群众造成错觉，影响以后填补的顺利开展。
