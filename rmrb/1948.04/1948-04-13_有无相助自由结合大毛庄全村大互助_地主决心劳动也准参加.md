Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th. Damao Village in Wulian (new county, southwest of Zhucheng) County, Shandong Province, suffered severe Chiang Kai-shek disasters last year, and the masses faced many difficulties in production. Twenty-two families of orphans and widows and six families of revolutionary martyrs lacked labor. Some poor and middle peasants also had very little labor and lacked livestock and farm tools, so they urgently needed to organize mutual aid to solve difficulties. However, some of the masses were worried because of the future division of land and the uncertain land rights. Some were not active in buying farm tools because the public had borrowed four small carts last year and had not yet returned them. Most were dissatisfied with the past mutual aid in which cadres forced the compilation and contracting, and the calculation of work points was unreasonable. Based on the above situation, the village work team convened a meeting to explain to the masses that no matter how the land is adjusted in the future, the government will guarantee their harvest for the land they cultivate themselves. They also made a review of the failure to return the borrowed carts. Then, the question of how to organize to ensure that not an acre of land in the village would be left uncultivated was raised, which aroused everyone's discussion. After reviewing the past shortcomings and recognizing the benefits of mutual aid, everyone unanimously proposed: "This year, the organization of mutual aid should change its regulations." Then, the two organizational principles of "free combination" and "mutual assistance of the haves and have-nots" were discussed at the poor and hired peasants' meeting and brought to the masses for deliberation, focusing on publicizing the need to take care of orphans, widows, and households without labor. At the same time, it was explained that those who enter the group with less labor could find work and food, and those with female labor could exchange work by making shoes and weaving, so that no one would suffer losses. Poor and hired peasants took the lead and organized everyone separately. After four or five days, more than 30 groups were formed. However, there was still a small group of people who were not organized, most of whom were landlords, followed by lazy people, "sharp heads" (people who like to take advantage), and a few poor peasants who lacked labor and livestock. The reasons why they were left out were that some landlords were afraid of labor and did not want to produce, and some had not yet bowed their heads to the masses and did not seek mutual aid from the peasants. Lazy people and "sharp heads" had caused others to suffer losses in the past mutual aid, so everyone was unwilling to partner with them. Some poor peasants were embarrassed to ask for help because they had no labor or livestock. After understanding these reasons, the work team solved them separately: (1) Discussing the issue of landlord mutual aid at the poor peasants' league and mutual aid group leaders' meeting, some people said: "The landlords have not bowed their heads and have not come to us." Some people said: "Landlords can't do it, they do less, aren't we suffering losses?" After discussion, everyone realized that if the landlords were not brought to cultivate the land, they would not be able to do it, and it would not be possible to "not leave an acre of land uncultivated." Therefore, everyone decided that "as long as the landlords come to us and are determined to work, we will bring them to mutual aid." And it was determined to record work points and calculate accounts so that everyone would not suffer losses. Then, a landlord meeting was held. After discussion, everyone clarified the direction of supporting their families through labor and transforming themselves, learning from the peasants, and reviewing the past lazy phenomena in mutual aid, and resolved to have both adults and children work in the fields. Shortly after the meeting, 13 of the 18 landlord families in the village joined the mutual aid group. (2) Hold meetings for lazy people and "sharp heads" to let them review why they couldn't find a group, and inspire them to review their mistakes. They also confessed their past tricks and laziness, and went to the mutual aid group to admit their mistakes and promise to work hard in the future. In this way, a total of six people quickly joined the mutual aid group. (3) Encourage poor peasants with little labor to find groups, and exchange work with others with the work they can do. At the same time, based on the principle of mutual assistance of the haves and have-nots, persuade those with labor and livestock to help poor brothers, so they all joined in. After ten days, the village has been fully organized and 42 mutual aid groups have been established. Revolutionary martyrs, the elderly and weak, landlords, etc., who have no labor, are also matched in each group. A production committee was immediately established to lead production, allocate livestock, and study issues such as calculating work points and accounts.

　　有无相助自由结合大毛庄全村大互助
  　地主决心劳动也准参加
    【新华社华东七日电】山东五莲（新县，诸城西南）县大毛庄因去年蒋灾严重，群众生产困难很多，全庄有二十二家孤寡及六家军烈属全无劳动力，还有些贫雇中农劳力很少，牲口、农具也很缺乏，急需组织互助解决困难。但群众中有的因以后还要平分，地权没有确定，有顾虑；有的因去年公家借用四辆小车未还，对买农具不积极；大部分是不满过去互助中干部强编包办，和计工折工不合理等。根据以上情况，该村工作组就召集会议，向群众说明不管将来土地如何调整，凡是自己种上的地，政府一定保证他的收获。对借车未还也作了检讨。然后提出如何组织起来，保证全村不荒一亩地的问题，引起大家讨论。在检讨了过去的缺点，认清了互助的好处后，大家一致提出：“今年组织互助要换换章程”。接着又在贫雇农会上讨论出“自由结合”与“有无相助”的两条组织原则，拿到群众中去酝酿，着重宣传要照顾孤寡无劳力户，同时也说明孤寡入组后出劳力少者找工找粮，有妇女劳动力者以做鞋纺织等换工，使互不吃亏。贫雇农并起带头作用，分头组织大家。这样经过四、五天后，组成了三十多个组。但是还有一小部分人没有组织进去，其中大部是地主，其次是懒汉、“尖头”（好占便宜的人）和少数缺劳力缺牲口的贫苦农民。他们被撇下的原因，由于一部分地主怕劳动不想生产，一部分还没有向群众低头，不去找农民互助。懒汉“尖头”则因过去在互助中使别人吃过亏，故大家不愿同他合伙。还有一部分贫苦农民因自己没劳力或没有牲口，不好意思向人张口。工作组了解这些原因后，即分别解决：（一）在贫农团、互助组长会上讨论地主互助问题，有人说：“地主没低头没来找过我们”，有人说：“地主不会干，干的少，我们不要吃他的亏吗？”经过讨论，大家认识了如果不带地主种地，他们就不会，就作不到“不荒一亩地”，于是大家决定“只要地主来找我们，并且决心劳动咱就带他互助。”并确定记工算帐，使大家不吃亏。接着又召开地主会，经过讨论，大家明确了劳动养家，改造自己的方向，要向农民学习，并检讨了过去在互助中的偷懒现象，决心连大人带小孩都上地干活。会后不久，全村十八家地主有十三户参加了互助组。（二）给懒汉“尖头”开会，让他们检讨为什么找不到组，启发他们检讨错误，他们也都把过去耍尖和偷懒的事情说了出来，并且去找互助组认错，保证以后好好干，这样一共六个人很快也都参加了互助组。（三）鼓励劳力少的贫苦农民去找组，以自己能干的活去和别人换工，同时一面帮助他们找适当的组，一面又本有无相助原则，说服有劳力有牲口的要帮助穷兄弟，这样也都参加进去了。前后经过十天工夫，现该村已全部组织起来，成立了四十二个互助组，无劳力的军烈属老弱地主等也在各组搭配开，并立即成立了生产委员会领导生产，调配牲口及研究计工、算帐等问题。
