Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 9th: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is making tremendous efforts to combat the famine caused by the Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandit troops, doing everything possible to rescue 400,000 disaster victims from starvation. In the Suide sub-region, which suffered severely, more than 100,600 people are disaster victims, accounting for 28 percent of the sub-region's population. In the Yan'an sub-region, Yan'an County and Panlong District, Yanchuan County's Yongping District, Zichang County's southern district, Anse County's first and second districts, and other areas were ravaged several times by the Hu bandits, leaving farmers' homes utterly devastated and most of the land barren. The entire sub-region has more than 233,000 disaster victims. In areas such as Jia County, Hengshan, and Zhenchuan (newly established county), some of the disaster victims are now only using fried buckwheat mixed with elm bark or livestock bone meal and cat and dog meat to stave off hunger. In addition to actively leading and organizing the people for disaster relief, the democratic government has also called on all government agencies and troops to launch a thrift and donation campaign for emergency relief.

In addition, governments at all levels are organizing disaster victims to engage in various sideline productions. The Border Region Production and Disaster Relief Headquarters and the Industrial Cooperative Office distributed 41,500 jin of cotton to the Suide and Yan'an sub-regions to mobilize women to spin. The Yan'an sub-region's Production and Disaster Relief Sub-Headquarters, centered on disaster areas such as Yongping, Panlong, and Zichang, organized 201 women's spinning groups, with 1,476 people participating in spinning. The Zichang County United Cooperative distributed more than 3,000 jin of cotton, and also organized 40 saltpeter boiling groups and six coal mining groups. The wages in grain earned by disaster victims in the southern district of the county from sideline production amounted to 17 shi. In Xiaoxuelifeng Village in Jia County, the joint transportation effort of ten disaster-stricken households earned six shi and five dou of grain in the winter. The People's Cooperative and the public-operated store in Gulin County (newly established county) in the Yan'an sub-region, in addition to lending out 3,000 jin of cotton for women to spin, also bought back 500 shi of grain from grain-producing areas and lent it interest-free to grain-deficient households during the spring famine, to be repaid in the autumn. In the Suide sub-region, which has a small area and a large population, more than 25,500 disaster victims have been relocated. The Disaster Relief Sub-Headquarters has established an immigrant transfer station in Suide City to help solve the problems of food, lodging, and some travel expenses. The Longdong sub-region, which is resettling immigrants, in addition to helping immigrants distribute land and livestock, also provides each immigrant with one dou of relief grain and organizes immigrants for spring plowing and sideline production. The Baima District of Hua Chi County has resettled 58 immigrant households, allocated 200 qing of land, more than 13 shi of grain, eight head of cattle, and farm implements.

The brotherly liberated area of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region donated 200,000 shi of relief grain to Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and 50,000 laborers have been mobilized by the Taiyue and Luliang liberated areas to transport it day and night. The disaster victims in the Border Region are deeply moved by the enthusiastic assistance of the people in the brotherly liberated areas, and unanimously praised that the people under the leadership of the Communist Party are truly one family!

    【新华社西北九日电】陕甘宁边区正以极大努力和蒋胡匪军造成的灾荒作斗争，全力抢救四十万灾民，免于饥饿。遭灾严重的绥德分区灾民达十万零六百多人，占该分区人口百分之二十八。延属分区之延安县与蟠龙区、延川县永坪区、子长县南区，安塞县一、二区等地遭胡匪数次蹂躏，农家十室九空，土地大部荒芜，全分区灾民达二十三万三千多人。葭县、横山、镇川（新设县）等地的灾民，现在有的只用荞麦炒榆树皮或牲畜骨粉及猫狗肉等物充饥。民主政府除已积极领导组织人民救灾外，并已号召各机关部队发动节约募捐急赈运动。
    此外，各地各级政府并组织灾民进行各种副业生产。边区生产救灾总会和工合办事处，曾分发绥德、延属两分区棉花四万一千五百斤，发动妇纺。延属分区生产救灾分会以永坪、蟠龙、子长等灾区为中心，组织了二百零一个妇纺组，参加纺织者达一千四百七十六人。子长县联社发放棉花三千余斤，该社并组织了四十个熬硝组，六个挖炭组等。该县南区灾民由副业生产所得工资米即达十七石。葭县小薛里峰村的合伙运输，十户灾民在冬季运输赚粮六石五斗。延属分区固临县（新设县）人民合作社及公营商店除贷花三千斤由众妇纺外，并到产粮区买回粮食五百石，于春荒期间无利贷给缺粮户，秋后收回。地少人多之绥德分区，已移走灾民二万五千五百余人，救灾分会特在绥市建立移民迁移站，帮助解决食宿和部份路费。安置移民地区之陇东分区，除帮助移民分配土地牲畜外，并发给移民每人一斗救济粮，组织移民春耕及副业生产。华池县白马区已安置五十八户移民，调剂土地二百垧，粮食十三石多、耕牛八头、及农具等物。
    兄弟解放区晋冀鲁豫边区捐助陕甘宁救济粮二十万市石，已由太岳、吕梁两解放区动员五万民工连日赶运。边区灾民对兄弟解放区人民的热情援助深为感动，一致称赞共产党领导下的人民真是一家人！
