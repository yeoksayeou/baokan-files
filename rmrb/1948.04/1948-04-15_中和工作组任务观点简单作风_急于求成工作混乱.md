[Taihang News] In the Zhonghe base point of the third district of Changzhi, the work has fallen into factionalism, with Party members becoming pessimistic and the masses becoming apathetic, making it impossible to break the deadlock. This is due to the work group's vague policy thinking and simplistic task-oriented work style. Of the 293 households in the village, over 80% of the poor and hired peasants have thoroughly turned themselves over. Twenty-eight households need assistance to make ends meet, so this village is basically considered a first-class village. From a composition standpoint, the branch is relatively pure, but its ideology and work style are poor. Some members protect landlords, while others embezzle and take more than their share of the fruits of labor. In particular, factionalism is very serious, and all factions have won over some of the masses. The movement since the anti-traitor and liquidation campaign has been carried out on the basis of factionalism, with mutual protection and mutual struggle. After the work group arrived in Zhonghe, the cadres who had been removed from their positions took the opportunity to become active, taking initiative to find the work group. Because the work group did not have enough understanding of this situation, they became caught up in the factionalism. Because the roots were not planted correctly, the poor and hired peasants who had not thoroughly turned themselves over and those who were upright did not dare to speak out during the visits and mobilization. They only secretly reflected: "If it is these people, we still cannot turn ourselves over. They are doing it to get the cadres who have been removed from power to get back on stage and not to let us turn ourselves over." However, the leadership still did not pay attention to the reflections of the poor and hired peasants and continued as before. It wasn't until the work group saw that the middle peasants were not speaking out during the class determination process, a few people were manipulating the meeting, and they wanted to raise the class status of the cadres, that the work could no longer be deepened, that the work group began to feel that they had entered the factionalism circle. They immediately decided to get out of the factionalism circle and re-mobilize the poor and hired peasants to expose the conspiracy of factionalism and disintegrate the factionalism group. However, because the comrades of the work group did not have enough understanding of the essence of the factionalism problem, they did not understand that this was a mass ideological problem, but only thought it was a problem of work methods. Therefore, the shift was very rapid, and the method was also simple. They singled out the factionalism leaders for rectification. As a result, the factionalism leaders complained a lot, and the masses did not realize the harm of factionalism to themselves. Although they later made self-criticisms at the poor and hired peasants' congress, the poor peasants gradually approached the work group and began to collude to more than eighty people, but the factionalism problem had not been resolved. On the other hand, in order to rectify the Party, they blindly established a poor peasant association, thinking that as long as they called back the former village chief Li Huaiwen to struggle against him, the democracy problem could be solved. They also did not have enough understanding of the principle of transformation and the spirit of distinguishing right from wrong that should be used in Party rectification. They did not prepare in advance. When they heard that the Party in Han Village had been made public, they went back and made the Party public as well. They made it public in the morning and rectified it in the afternoon. The leadership appointed the poor peasant association group leaders to participate in the rectification. Because these people did not understand why they should rectify and how to rectify, they showed a supportive attitude and asked to pass it quickly. Party members who had made big mistakes wanted to muddle through because the masses were not aware. They rectified two people on the first day, thinking it was too slow, and on the last day they passed eight people. The four-day Party rectification ended. Because the purpose of Party rectification was not clear, the ideological preparation was not sufficient, and the brewing was not mature, everyone showed a task-oriented viewpoint. There was neither leadership nor development of ideological struggle within the Party. They did not distinguish between right and wrong regarding the good and bad of Party members' mistakes. They did not criticize Party members who were not active in their work and did not play a role, but instead thought they were good Party members. One Party member had given a box to a district cadre, and the masses would not pass it. The leadership did not enlighten and guide the masses to distinguish right from wrong, and the masses said what they said. As a result, the Party members who did not pass were pessimistic and regretted that they should not have joined the Party and should not have been active. Party members who usually did not play a role were secretly happy and felt that not being active was a good Party member, which reduced the Party's prestige among the masses, and the movement also subsided.

### 中和工作组任务观点简单作风　急于求成工作混乱

　　中和工作组任务观点简单作风
  　急于求成工作混乱
    【太行消息】长治三区中和基点，因为工作组政策思想的模糊与工作上的单纯任务观点，简单化作风，使工作陷入宗派，党员悲观，群众消沉，一直打不开局面。全村共二百九十三户，百分之八十以上贫雇已翻透身。有二十八户需要填补，这村基本上算是一类村。支部从成份上看是较纯的，但思想作风不好，有的包庇地主，有的贪污多占果实。特别是宗派很厉害，且都拉拢有一部分群众。反奸清算以来的运动，是在宗派基础上进行的，互相包庇互相斗争。工作组到了中和以后，下了台的这批干部，趁机活动，主动找工作组，工作组因对这种情况了解不够，结果就卷进宗派圈子里。因为根没扎正，在访问发动中，没翻透身及正派的贫雇，还是不敢说话，只偷偷反映：“要是这批人，咱还是翻不了身，他们是为打下干部他们上台的，并不是为咱翻身”。但领导上仍不注意贫雇农的反映照旧的进行。直到划阶级时，工作员看到中农不发言，少数人操纵会场，要给干部提高成份，工作再也深入不下去时，工作组才开始感到是钻进了宗派圈子。当即确定转出宗派圈子，重新深入发动贫雇，揭发宗派阴谋，瓦解宗派集团。但由于工作组同志对宗派问题的本质认识不够。不了解这是一个群众思想问题，只认为是工作作法问题。因此转的很急，方法也简单，叫上宗派头子个别整，结果宗派头子大发牢骚，群众也没认识到宗派对自己的危害。后虽然在贫雇农大会上作了自我检讨，贫农才逐渐靠近工作组，开始串通到八十多人，但宗派问题还未得到解决。另一方面，为了整党又盲目成立了贫农团，认为只要把过去村长李怀文叫回来斗争一顿，民主问题就可解决。对整党应该是改造方针与明辨是非的精神也了解不够，事前没有作准备，听说韩店党公开了，回去便也公开党，上午公开，下午就整。领导上指定贫农团小组长来参加整，这些人因为不了解为什么要整与怎样整？表现有支差态度，要求赶快通过。错误大的党员，趁群众不觉悟，想混过关去，头天整了两个，以为太慢，到最后一天就通过了八个。四天整党就结束了。由于整党目的性不明确，思想准备不够，酝酿不成熟，大家都表现了一种完成任务的观点。既没领导，又无开展党内思想斗争，对党员错误好坏，是非不分。对工作不积极、不起作用的党员不进行批评，反认为是好党员。一个党员给区干部送过一个箱子，群众就不通过，领导上也不启发诱导群众分清是非，群众说啥是啥。结果闹的通不过的党员悲观，后悔不该参加党，不该积极；平常不起作用的党员，反而幸灾乐祸，觉得不积极就是好党员，降低了党在群众中的威信，运动也消沉了。
