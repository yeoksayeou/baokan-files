　　Correspondence No. 26
    In this rectification movement, the Propaganda Departments of various district committees and the county committee offices, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Bureau's Propaganda and Liaison Conference, paid attention to the review and rectification of the original news correspondent teams. At the same time, they developed a large number of revolutionary staff members and cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds to undertake communication work for this newspaper. As of now, we have received more than 1,350 correspondent registration forms from various regions, including 880 people from six sub-districts of Taihang. A total of 237 people from the 3rd and 4th district committees of Jinnan. 140 people from the 4th district committee of Jilu Yu. 89 people from the 3rd and 4th district committees of Taiyue. Among them, most comrades from Taihang and Jinnan have contacted us through letters after participating in the land reform work teams and production work teams, providing materials on the democratic filling movement and the production movement. Many comrades from worker and peasant backgrounds "write about what they do" in their work, enthusiastically writing articles for this newspaper, which has added new strength to our communication team. In addition to expressing our warm welcome, due to the limited manpower of this newspaper, we cannot universally connect with everyone. We hope to promote the past experience of communication reporting work, earnestly serve as assistants to workers and peasants, and promote the "mutual assistance and self-study" movement between intellectuals and worker-peasant comrades to improve the reporting work a step further.
    At present, the work in the experimental areas of land reform is gradually deepening. We hope that comrades who participate as correspondents in work teams will actively respond to the newspaper's call for submissions for the land reform typical report news bonus writing campaign, strengthen investigation and research, and organize reports in a planned way, so that correct experiences can be promoted and errors will not be repeated. As for correspondents participating in production work, please vigorously report on materials on how to eliminate production obstacles and promote the production mutual aid movement. Urban agency correspondents are expected to strengthen the reporting work on the development of industry and commerce.

　　通信往来　第二十六号
    在这次整编运动中，各地委宣传部县委办公室，根据中央局宣联会精神，注意到对原有新闻通讯队伍的审查整顿，同时发展了大批革命职员及工农出身干部为本报担负通讯工作。截至现在为止，我们已收到各区寄来通讯员登记表一千三百五十余份，计太行六个分区八百八十人。冀南三、四地委共二百卅七人。冀鲁豫四地委一百四十人。太岳三四地委八十九人。其中太行冀南大部同志在参加土改工作团及生产工作队以后，已先后来信联系，供给民主填补运动和生产运动的材料。不少工农出身同志，在工作中“做啥写啥”，热忱为本报写稿，使我们通讯队伍增加新的力量。我们除了表示热忱欢迎之外，因本报人力有限，不能普遍联系，希发扬以往通讯报导工作经验，认真为工农当助手，提倡知识分子与工农同志结合“互助自学”运动，把报导工作向前提高一步。
    目前各地土改实验地区工作正逐步深入，希参加工作团通讯员同志，积极响应本报征求土改典型报导新闻奖金写稿运动，加强调查研究，有计划的组织报导，使正确的经验得到发扬，错误的不再重犯。至于参加生产工作通讯员则请大力报导：如何扫除生产障碍，推进生产互助运动的材料。城市机关通讯员则望加强对发展工商业的报导工作。
