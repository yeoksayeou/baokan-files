　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 3rd. In February, the Jiangsu Ba Yellow River embankment in Juancheng was damaged by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. After it was just repaired, on March 17, just as the Yellow River water was rising, the sod revetment of sections seven and eight of the Lao'er Dam and the foundation of the Xin'er Dam were in a very dangerous situation. Chiang Kai-shek's 200th Brigade of the 5th Reorganized Division took the opportunity to sneak to Jiangsu Ba, cutting 380 ropes from the revetment of the second, third, and fourth embankments of the dangerous project. One hundred and fifty rows of faggot piles were pushed into the water. Then they went to the straw yard of Sanxiaoyanglou and burned more than 600,000 catties of straw, throwing more than 17,800 cubic feet of stone brick material into the river, and looting 8,000 catties of hemp, 510 hemp ropes, more than 18,000 wooden stakes, and a large number of wooden materials for repairing houses. On the night of the 18th, the local militia captured the perpetrators Ma Sanning and Cui Wanjun and sent them to the democratic government for legal action. On March 22, Chiang Kai-shek's 84th Reorganized Division sneaked to Wangzhuang dangerous project in northern Yuncheng, forcing the masses to dig the dikes and release water. Fortunately, our local armed forces arrived and drove the enemy away, and the dangerous project was preserved.
