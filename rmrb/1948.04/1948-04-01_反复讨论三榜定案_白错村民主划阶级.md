Repeated Discussions Led to Three-List Settlement
  Bai Cuo Village Democratically Classifies People
    [This newspaper's news] After the democratic rectification movement in Bai Cuo Village, Fourth District of Shahe, democratic class classification began. Class classification was based on the ownership of the means of production and production relations. In terms of method, democracy was fully promoted, and the method of self-reporting, public discussion, and three-list settlement was adopted. The leadership especially respected and retained the opinions of a minority of people, truly ensuring that no one was wronged.
    Before the class classification, the comrades of the work team first studied the class classification documents, and then began to talk to the masses about class, explaining the differences between landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants. Three days were spent brewing discussions among the masses. At the same time, households were selected from among the activists of the poor peasants, farm laborers, and new middle peasants to conduct experiments, so that they could clarify the conditions and methods of class classification, in order to play a core role among the masses.
    During the first classification, twelve groups were first divided, and the comrades of the work team participated in three groups. Each group was led by the group leader and the peasant association committee member. At the beginning, the debate in each group was not enthusiastic. At this time, two situations appeared: (1) Some groups could not overcome their personal relationships and classified people very quickly and carelessly. (2) The group where the work team members were located formed a situation of doing everything, forming a kind of trial-like situation, with each person going through the process once. The comrades of the work team felt that something was wrong, and immediately reviewed and studied after the meeting; and convened a general meeting to re-explain: "It is not good to be sentimental, and it is not good to rely solely on the work team members. The work team members do not have the right to determine the composition, they are just a secretary of the masses, whoever everyone wants to write, just write it." Then the twelve groups were merged again, and it was better than before. The debate in each group became heated. During the classification, Hao Guangdong reported himself, saying: "I used to have 40 mu of land (before liberation), nine people in my family (having been struggled against), one and a half laborers, not exploiting others, the average output per person was three shi and three dou (the same as the village average), and life was neither good nor bad. I think I am an old middle peasant." Someone stood up and said: "I disagree. Although he did not exploit others, before liberation he only paid land tax on 20 mu of his 40 mu of land, leaving 20 mu untaxed. This is even worse than exploitation. He is an upper-middle peasant." A member of the work team expressed his opinion: "The classification of composition cannot be based on that one item." So the masses re-brewed the idea, and finally decided that he was an old middle peasant, and everyone had no objection. Han Shun said: "I will say what I have. Before liberation, there were three people in my family. Last year, I was allocated eight mu of land and nine rooms. Last year, I was allocated another six mu of land, half a cow, and although I don't have many farm tools, they are enough for me to use. I also have land for growing flowers, and I don't have any difficulties. I think I'm a new middle peasant." After deliberation, everyone unanimously said: "Agreed, count as a new middle peasant." The masses said: "If everyone told the truth like Shun did, the classification would be faster." Han Shun said happily: "I originally had nine and a half mu of land, four people in my family. After liberation in 1945, I was allocated eight mu of land and bought a donkey. Now there are three people in my family, 17 mu of land, and the average output per person is five shi (exceeding the village average output by about two shi). I was originally a poor peasant, but now I am a lower-middle peasant." Everyone disagreed, some said he was a new middle peasant, and some advocated an old middle peasant. Later, it was put aside for later classification. At this time, the emotions were very enthusiastic, especially when classifying the old middle peasant and upper-middle peasant households, the arguments were strong. Hu Hucheng said that he was an old middle peasant, and everyone disagreed, saying: "You have more than 30 mu of land, five people in your family, you are an upper-middle peasant." He said that he did not exploit anyone! Everyone said that you exploited your nephew. Hucheng still insisted on his own opinion, saying: "My nephew is a cripple, he has no family, he eats and lives in my house. We are two good laborers, if he were not in my house, the land would not be enough for us to do ourselves!" He boldly insisted on his own opinion, and later it was also put aside, undecided. This time, everyone dared to speak and dared to insist on their own opinions, and finally they were all classified once. Each group made a summary, and on the 18th, the list was written out. The whole village had a total of 234 households: 8 landlord households, 10 rich peasant households, 24 upper-middle peasant households, 61 old middle peasant households, 86 new middle peasant households, 33 poor peasant households, and 12 households that had not been classified. The masses rushed to see it.
    On the 19th, a general meeting was held again, with landlords and rich peasants also participating, for a second review. This time, the poor peasants and new middle peasants had few opinions, and the landlords and rich peasants also had few opinions. The old middle peasants and upper-middle peasants had particularly many opinions, and many households were re-decided. After another two days of deliberation, the second list was released. This time, there were especially many people looking at the list. At the same time, the masses were shouting about class classification everywhere. Some people were still looking at it while eating, and some were crowding and arguing under the list with lights on until dark. As soon as Hu Xiaolai saw his composition, he said: "I am afraid as soon as I see upper-middle peasant. I have no objection to being an old middle peasant." He left very satisfied. Hao Yonglin asked about himself being in the upper-middle peasant category, and said: "I was in the upper-middle peasant category on the first list, and this time I am still in the upper-middle peasant category!" He showed some disagreement. Hao Cunjian asked about himself being an old middle peasant, and said angrily: "I was a new middle peasant on the first list, and this time I have become an old middle peasant again. I disagree and will raise an opinion." He left very anxiously. Many people watched, and those who were happy with their own results expressed "satisfaction" and left with smiles. This was the climax of class classification. Men, women, old men, and young people were all talking about their own composition and the composition of others. The work team paid close attention to "retaining the opinions of a minority of people, so that no one is wronged," and said to the masses: "Anyone who has different opinions can raise them for research." For example, LÃ¼ Chuncai raised that he was dissatisfied with being classified as an upper-middle peasant, and the work team recorded it. Many people dared to raise their own different opinions.
    The third class classification was mainly to clarify the composition of individual households. In the discussion, Hu Qingxiu was a household that had newly emerged after the incident. By 1944 (one year before liberation), he already had 51 mu of land (not good), including 20 mu of mortgaged land, one and a half laborers, two livestock, and hired half a long-term worker and short-term workers for four months that year. In 1943, he used short-term workers for 45 days. After liberation, he gave up 20 mu of land and no longer hired people. According to his exploitation, it was 26% in the past, but the masses still agreed that he was an upper-middle peasant, because he worked very well himself, and picked up manure when going to the market and going to the land, and saved money. Although the land he planted was very bad, he did not produce less grain than good land. Generally, it took two workdays per mu to hoe the land, but he used three per mu. He treated the workers he hired well, but he ate badly himself. So everyone agreed to classify him as an upper-middle peasant. The masses said: "If we classify him as a rich peasant, production will be affected." Now that he is determined to be an upper-middle peasant, he is very satisfied. He said to the work team members: "I was not allowed to participate in the peasant association before. My old man fought for three days and three nights without sleeping, and couldn't even eat. This time, I was classified as an upper-middle peasant and also participated in the peasant association. I agree very much and I am very happy. I will not say anything. Just let me participate in the meeting. I will produce well in the future." Hao Shude originally had 60 mu of good land by the village, ten people in his family, and three laborers, but only one was useful. He himself came from a schooling background and tilled the land very crudely, feeding hired people badly, and not hired people well, so they were unwilling to work for him. As a result, he could not hoe the land in time and it was left barren. The result of the evaluation was: "He turned good land into bad land, so he cannot be considered an upper-middle peasant, but a rich peasant." After deliberation, no decision was made. Hao Yonglin had two laborers and 34 mu of good land. He had hired a long-term worker for one year and constantly used short-term workers (around 1943). He had one laborer who was often not on the land. The masses said: "He certainly does not qualify as a rich peasant, but when the enemy was there, his family's main source of livelihood depended on being a puppet bao chief." First, the puppet bao chief earned millet, which the masses said was blatant exploitation; second, corruption was secret exploitation; third, he used his power to find cheap work to do indiscriminately. Because of these reasons, the masses said he was a rich peasant, but he disagreed, and no decision has been made yet. Han Jisuo was originally classified as an old middle peasant, but was promoted to an upper-middle peasant during the class classification. He disagreed. After this explanation, he agreed and was still determined to be an upper-middle peasant. Hu Maotang was a semi-farmer and semi-merchant. He had six people in his family. According to the output, he seemed to be a lower-middle peasant; but because he did business himself, he had to hire short-term workers for one month every year. He was originally classified as a middle peasant, but was later promoted to an upper-middle peasant. He disagreed. The third time, he agreed and was determined to be an upper-middle peasant.
    The village is currently brewing democratic elections for the peasant representative conference. After the peasant representative conference is established, the third list will be announced and the composition will be determined.
    In this class classification, the masses felt that it was truly democratic, and they dared to speak and raise opinions, believing that this was the first time. Some masses reflected: "In the past, the cadres were King Yama and we common people were little ghosts. Whatever they told us to do, we had to do. Now we have become the masters and the cadres have become long-term workers. This is really democracy." The masses were all extremely happy. However, the following should be noted in the leadership: (1) Fully promote the democracy of the masses, and especially respect the opinions of individuals, so as to ensure that no one is wronged; (2) Pay attention to correcting deviations in time during the classification and carry out corrections; (3) At the same time, pay more attention to ensuring that class classification is not linked to personality, especially in the semi-liberated and new areas, the masses hate those who have been puppet bao chiefs and puppet soldiers very much, and often mention how the puppet bao chiefs oppressed people when classifying their composition, using this as a condition for class classification, which is not appropriate.

    Editor's Note:
    In the process of class classification in Bai Cuo Village, the promotion of democracy was well done. However, the comrades of the work team did not sufficiently implement the Party's leadership role, judging from the submitted manuscript. This is reflected in: First, on the issue of upper-middle peasants, the masses did not regard it as an important issue to distinguish between rich peasants and middle peasants (i.e., exploiting classes and independent laborers), but focused on squeezing upper-middle peasants out of middle peasants. This would create a misconception, like Hu Xiaolai "being afraid as soon as he saw upper-middle peasants," disrupting his own camp. Second, the establishment of landlord and rich peasant composition is not clear in the manuscript. However, based on the evaluation result of Hao Shude that "he turned good land into bad land, so he cannot be considered an upper-middle peasant, but a rich peasant" (this statement is wrong), it is possible that there are still problems with other landlords and rich peasants who have been classified, which is worth considering.
    In addition, the decision on Hu Maotang's composition also has problems. I hope you will study it again. In short, when determining the composition of a specific person, be very cautious. If the masses have incorrect opinions, persuade them at any time, so as to achieve "no one being wronged."
