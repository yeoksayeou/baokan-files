Repeated Discussions Led to Three-List Settlement
  Bai Cuo Village Democratically Classifies People
    [This newspaper's news] After the democratic rectification movement in Bai Cuo Village, Fourth District of Shahe, democratic class classification began. Class classification was based on the ownership of the means of production and production relations. In terms of method, democracy was fully promoted, and the method of self-reporting, public discussion, and three-list settlement was adopted. The leadership especially respected and retained the opinions of a minority of people, truly ensuring that no one was wronged.
    Before the class classification, the comrades of the work team first studied the class classification documents, and then began to talk to the masses about class, explaining the differences between landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants. Three days were spent brewing discussions among the masses. At the same time, households were selected from among the activists of the poor peasants, farm laborers, and new middle peasants to conduct experiments, so that they could clarify the conditions and methods of class classification, in order to play a core role among the masses.
    During the first classification, twelve groups were first divided, and the comrades of the work team participated in three groups. Each group was led by the group leader and the peasant association committee member. At the beginning, the debate in each group was not enthusiastic. At this time, two situations appeared: (1) Some groups could not overcome their personal relationships and classified people very quickly and carelessly. (2) The group where the work team members were located formed a situation of doing everything, forming a kind of trial-like situation, with each person going through the process once. The comrades of the work team felt that something was wrong, and immediately reviewed and studied after the meeting; and convened a general meeting to re-explain: "It is not good to be sentimental, and it is not good to rely solely on the work team members. The work team members do not have the right to determine the composition, they are just a secretary of the masses, whoever everyone wants to write, just write it." Then the twelve groups were merged again, and it was better than before. The debate in each group became heated. During the classification, Hao Guangdong reported himself, saying: "I used to have 40 mu of land (before liberation), nine people in my family (having been struggled against), one and a half laborers, not exploiting others, the average output per person was three shi and three dou (the same as the village average), and life was neither good nor bad. I think I am an old middle peasant." Someone stood up and said: "I disagree. Although he did not exploit others, before liberation he only paid land tax on 20 mu of his 40 mu of land, leaving 20 mu untaxed. This is even worse than exploitation. He is an upper-middle peasant." A member of the work team expressed his opinion: "The classification of composition cannot be based on that one item." So the masses re-brewed the idea, and finally decided that he was an old middle peasant, and everyone had no objection. Han Shun said: "I will say what I have. Before liberation, there were three people in my family. Last year, I was allocated eight mu of land and nine rooms. Last year, I was allocated another six mu of land, half a cow, and although I don't have many farm tools, they are enough for me to use. I also have land for growing flowers, and I don't have any difficulties. I think I'm a new middle peasant." After deliberation, everyone unanimously said: "Agreed, count as a new middle peasant." The masses said: "If everyone told the truth like Shun did, the classification would be faster." Han Shun said happily: "I originally had nine and a half mu of land, four people in my family. After liberation in 1945, I was allocated eight mu of land and bought a donkey. Now there are three people in my family, 17 mu of land, and the average output per person is five shi (exceeding the village average output by about two shi). I was originally a poor peasant, but now I am a lower-middle peasant." Everyone disagreed, some said he was a new middle peasant, and some advocated an old middle peasant. Later, it was put aside for later classification. At this time, the emotions were very enthusiastic, especially when classifying the old middle peasant and upper-middle peasant households, the arguments were strong. Hu Hucheng said that he was an old middle peasant, and everyone disagreed, saying: "You have more than 30 mu of land, five people in your family, you are an upper-middle peasant." He said that he did not exploit anyone! Everyone said that you exploited your nephew. Hucheng still insisted on his own opinion, saying: "My nephew is a cripple, he has no family, he eats and lives in my house. We are two good laborers, if he were not in my house, the land would not be enough for us to do ourselves!" He boldly insisted on his own opinion, and later it was also put aside, undecided. This time, everyone dared to speak and dared to insist on their own opinions, and finally they were all classified once. Each group made a summary, and on the 18th, the list was written out. The whole village had a total of 234 households: 8 landlord households, 10 rich peasant households, 24 upper-middle peasant households, 61 old middle peasant households, 86 new middle peasant households, 33 poor peasant households, and 12 households that had not been classified. The masses rushed to see it.
    On the 19th, a general meeting was held again, with landlords and rich peasants also participating, for a second review. This time, the poor peasants and new middle peasants had few opinions, and the landlords and rich peasants also had few opinions. The old middle peasants and upper-middle peasants had particularly many opinions, and many households were re-decided. After another two days of deliberation, the second list was released. This time, there were especially many people looking at the list. At the same time, the masses were shouting about class classification everywhere. Some people were still looking at it while eating, and some were crowding and arguing under the list with lights on until dark. As soon as Hu Xiaolai saw his composition, he said: "I am afraid as soon as I see upper-middle peasant. I have no objection to being an old middle peasant." He left very satisfied. Hao Yonglin asked about himself being in the upper-middle peasant category, and said: "I was in the upper-middle peasant category on the first list, and this time I am still in the upper-middle peasant category!" He showed some disagreement. Hao Cunjian asked about himself being an old middle peasant, and said angrily: "I was a new middle peasant on the first list, and this time I have become an old middle peasant again. I disagree and will raise an opinion." He left very anxiously. Many people watched, and those who were happy with their own results expressed "satisfaction" and left with smiles. This was the climax of class classification. Men, women, old men, and young people were all talking about their own composition and the composition of others. The work team paid close attention to "retaining the opinions of a minority of people, so that no one is wronged," and said to the masses: "Anyone who has different opinions can raise them for research." For example, Lü Chuncai raised that he was dissatisfied with being classified as an upper-middle peasant, and the work team recorded it. Many people dared to raise their own different opinions.
    The third class classification was mainly to clarify the composition of individual households. In the discussion, Hu Qingxiu was a household that had newly emerged after the incident. By 1944 (one year before liberation), he already had 51 mu of land (not good), including 20 mu of mortgaged land, one and a half laborers, two livestock, and hired half a long-term worker and short-term workers for four months that year. In 1943, he used short-term workers for 45 days. After liberation, he gave up 20 mu of land and no longer hired people. According to his exploitation, it was 26% in the past, but the masses still agreed that he was an upper-middle peasant, because he worked very well himself, and picked up manure when going to the market and going to the land, and saved money. Although the land he planted was very bad, he did not produce less grain than good land. Generally, it took two workdays per mu to hoe the land, but he used three per mu. He treated the workers he hired well, but he ate badly himself. So everyone agreed to classify him as an upper-middle peasant. The masses said: "If we classify him as a rich peasant, production will be affected." Now that he is determined to be an upper-middle peasant, he is very satisfied. He said to the work team members: "I was not allowed to participate in the peasant association before. My old man fought for three days and three nights without sleeping, and couldn't even eat. This time, I was classified as an upper-middle peasant and also participated in the peasant association. I agree very much and I am very happy. I will not say anything. Just let me participate in the meeting. I will produce well in the future." Hao Shude originally had 60 mu of good land by the village, ten people in his family, and three laborers, but only one was useful. He himself came from a schooling background and tilled the land very crudely, feeding hired people badly, and not hired people well, so they were unwilling to work for him. As a result, he could not hoe the land in time and it was left barren. The result of the evaluation was: "He turned good land into bad land, so he cannot be considered an upper-middle peasant, but a rich peasant." After deliberation, no decision was made. Hao Yonglin had two laborers and 34 mu of good land. He had hired a long-term worker for one year and constantly used short-term workers (around 1943). He had one laborer who was often not on the land. The masses said: "He certainly does not qualify as a rich peasant, but when the enemy was there, his family's main source of livelihood depended on being a puppet bao chief." First, the puppet bao chief earned millet, which the masses said was blatant exploitation; second, corruption was secret exploitation; third, he used his power to find cheap work to do indiscriminately. Because of these reasons, the masses said he was a rich peasant, but he disagreed, and no decision has been made yet. Han Jisuo was originally classified as an old middle peasant, but was promoted to an upper-middle peasant during the class classification. He disagreed. After this explanation, he agreed and was still determined to be an upper-middle peasant. Hu Maotang was a semi-farmer and semi-merchant. He had six people in his family. According to the output, he seemed to be a lower-middle peasant; but because he did business himself, he had to hire short-term workers for one month every year. He was originally classified as a middle peasant, but was later promoted to an upper-middle peasant. He disagreed. The third time, he agreed and was determined to be an upper-middle peasant.
    The village is currently brewing democratic elections for the peasant representative conference. After the peasant representative conference is established, the third list will be announced and the composition will be determined.
    In this class classification, the masses felt that it was truly democratic, and they dared to speak and raise opinions, believing that this was the first time. Some masses reflected: "In the past, the cadres were King Yama and we common people were little ghosts. Whatever they told us to do, we had to do. Now we have become the masters and the cadres have become long-term workers. This is really democracy." The masses were all extremely happy. However, the following should be noted in the leadership: (1) Fully promote the democracy of the masses, and especially respect the opinions of individuals, so as to ensure that no one is wronged; (2) Pay attention to correcting deviations in time during the classification and carry out corrections; (3) At the same time, pay more attention to ensuring that class classification is not linked to personality, especially in the semi-liberated and new areas, the masses hate those who have been puppet bao chiefs and puppet soldiers very much, and often mention how the puppet bao chiefs oppressed people when classifying their composition, using this as a condition for class classification, which is not appropriate.

    Editor's Note:
    In the process of class classification in Bai Cuo Village, the promotion of democracy was well done. However, the comrades of the work team did not sufficiently implement the Party's leadership role, judging from the submitted manuscript. This is reflected in: First, on the issue of upper-middle peasants, the masses did not regard it as an important issue to distinguish between rich peasants and middle peasants (i.e., exploiting classes and independent laborers), but focused on squeezing upper-middle peasants out of middle peasants. This would create a misconception, like Hu Xiaolai "being afraid as soon as he saw upper-middle peasants," disrupting his own camp. Second, the establishment of landlord and rich peasant composition is not clear in the manuscript. However, based on the evaluation result of Hao Shude that "he turned good land into bad land, so he cannot be considered an upper-middle peasant, but a rich peasant" (this statement is wrong), it is possible that there are still problems with other landlords and rich peasants who have been classified, which is worth considering.
    In addition, the decision on Hu Maotang's composition also has problems. I hope you will study it again. In short, when determining the composition of a specific person, be very cautious. If the masses have incorrect opinions, persuade them at any time, so as to achieve "no one being wronged."

### 反复讨论三榜定案　白错村民主划阶级

　　反复讨论三榜定案
  　白错村民主划阶级
    【本报消息】沙河四区白错村，经过民主整党运动后，便开始了民主划阶级，划阶级是以生产手段占有情况及生产关系来作标准。方法上充分发扬了民主，采取了自报公议三榜定案的办法，领导上特别尊重保留少数人的意见，真正作到一个人也不受屈。
    在未划阶级前，工作组同志首先学习了划阶级的文件，便开始向群众讲阶级，说明地主、富农、中贫农的区别。用三天时间，在群众中酝酿讨论，同时在贫雇新中农中的积极分子里，抽出户来进行试验，使他们明确划阶级的条件办法，以便在群众中起核心作用。
    第一次划时，先分了十二个小组，工作组同志分头参加三个组，各组都由小组长及农会委员领导，开始各组争论不热烈。这时出现了两种情况：（一）有的组打不破情面，划得很快，很不仔细。（二）工作员所在组形成了包办，形成一种审案式的，一个个都过了一遍。工作组同志觉得不对头，会后便立即检讨研究；并召开大会，重新说明：“要情面不好，单靠工作员也不好，工作员没有定成份的权利，是群众一个书记，大家叫写谁就写谁。”随着把十二个组又合并了一下，此后比前好了，各小组的争论热烈起来。划时，郝广东自报说：“我以前（未解放时）四十亩地，九口人（被斗争过），一个半劳力，不剥削别人，每口平均产量三石三（与全村平均数相同），生活上不好不坏，我看是个老中农。”有人站起说：“不同意，他虽没剥削，解放前他四十亩地，只上二十亩地银钱，空银二十亩，这比剥削还厉害，他是上中农。”工作员发表意见说：“划成份不能算那一项。”于是群众又重新酝酿起来，最后仍决定为老中农，大家都没意见。韩顺的说：“咱有啥说啥，解放前三口人，前年分地八亩、九间房，去年又分了六亩地，半头牛，农具虽不多也够使用，也有种花地，啥也不困难，我算个新中农吧。”大家经酝酿都一致说：“同意，算新中农吧”。群众说：“要都象顺的这样说实话，划时可快哩。”韩顺喜说：“我原有九亩半地，四口人，三十四年解放后分地八亩，买驴一头，现在家三口人，十七亩地，每人平均产量五石（超过全村平均产量约二石），我原是贫农，这时候是下中农吧。”大家都不同意，有的说是新中农，有的主张老中农。后来放下随后再划。这时情绪十分热烈，特别是划到老中农和上中农户上，争吵劲大。胡虎成说我是老中农，大家不同意说：“你有三十多亩地、五口人，你是个上中农。”他说我没有剥削人呀！大家说你剥削了你外甥。虎成仍坚持自己意见说：“我外甥是个拐子，他家没人，在我家也吃也受，俺两个好劳力，他不在俺家，地还不够自己做的呀！”一直是大胆的坚持自己意见，后来也放下了，未决定。这次每个人都敢说话了，并独自敢坚持意见，最后都划了一遍，各组一总结，便于十八号写出榜来，全村共二百三十四户，地主八户，富农十户，上中农二十四户，老中农六十一户，新中农八十六户，贫农三十三户，未划十二户，群众都抢着去看。
    在十九号又召开了全体大会，地主富农也参加，作第二次审查。这次贫农新中农意见不多，地主富农意见也不多，老中农和上中农意见特别多，有好多户又作了重新决定。又经两天酝酿，才出了第二次榜，这一次看榜人特别多。同时群众中到处嚷着划阶级，有好些人吃着饭还去看，有的到天黑了点着灯还在榜下挤着吵着。胡小来一看见自己成份说：“我一见上中农就害怕，我在老中农内就没有意见”，很满意的走了。郝永林问了一下自己是在上中农内，说：“头一次榜上我在上中农内，这次还在上中农内！”他表现有些不很同意的样子。郝存见问了下自己是老中农，很起火的说：“头一次榜我是新中农来，这一次又成了老中农了，我不同意，提意见去”，便很着急的走了。看的人很多，合自己意的便表示“满意”的说着笑嘻嘻的走了。这是划阶级的高潮时期，男的女的老汉青年都在谈论着自己的成份和其他人的成份，工作组对“保留少数人的意见，做到没人受屈，这一点十分注意，并向群众说：“谁有不同意见，都可以提出来研究。”如吕春才提出他对自己划成上中农不满，工作组便记了起来。好多人都敢提出自己的不同意见。
    进行第三次划阶级，主要是弄清个别户的成份。在讨论中，胡清秀是事变后新起来的户，到三十三年（解放前一年）已有地五十一亩（不好），内有典地二十亩，劳力一个半，牲口二头，当年雇长工半个，短工四个月，三十二年用短工四十五天。解放后去地二十亩，不用人了。按他的剥削，从前有百分之二十六，但群众仍同意他为上中农，理由是他自己劳动很好，赶集上地都要拾粪，省吃俭用，他种的地虽很坏，并不比好地少打粮食，一般人锄地每亩用二个工，他每亩用三个，用上工人叫工人吃的好，自己吃的坏。所以大家同意把他划成上中农。群众说：“如果要把他划成富农，生产要受影响的。”现在定为上中农，他很满意。他和工作员说：“以前没叫我参加农会，我老汉打了三明三夜没睡，饭也吃不上。这次划我为上中农，又参加了农会，我很同意，很痛快，我是啥也不说，叫我参加会就行，我往后还要好好生产的。”郝树德，原有村边好地六十亩，十口人，三个劳力只顶一个用。他本人是个上学出身，种地很粗糙，用上人吃坏的，不用人吃好的，所以都不愿与他受，结果锄地锄不过来就荒了。评议结果是“他把好地种成坏地，不能算上中农是富农。”经酝酿仍未作决定。郝用林有劳力两个，好地三十四亩，用过一年长工，不断用短工（三十三年前后），他有一个劳力，常不在地。群众说：“他当然不够富农资格，可是敌人在时，他家主要生活就靠伪保长过。”一、伪保长赚小米，群众说是明剥削；二、贪污是暗剥削；三、以自己权力乱找便宜活干。由于这些原因，群众说是富农，他不同意，现仍未决定。韩记锁原划为老中农后，比阶级时提成上中农，他不同意，经这次解释后，同意了，仍定为上中农。胡茂堂是个半农半商的人，自己六口人，按产量是个下中农的样子；但由于自己做买卖，每年要雇短工一个月，原订他为中农，后提为上中农，他不同意，第三次他同意了，决定为上中农。
    该村正在酝酿民主选举农代会，等农代会成立以后，公布第三榜，决定成份。
    在这次划阶级中，群众感到是真正民主的，都敢说话提意见，认为这是第一次。有的群众反映说：“过去时人家干部是阎王，咱老百姓是小鬼，叫咱干啥，咱就得干啥，这时候当成了主人，干部成了长工，这真民主呀”。群众都高兴的不得了。但在领导上应注意的是：（一）充分发扬群众的民主，特别要做到尊重个别人意见，这样才能做到不使一个人被屈；（二）在划中应注意及时的纠正偏向，进行拨灯；（三）同时更要注意，划阶级不应连系人格，特别在半老区新区群众对那些当过伪保长及伪军的人很仇恨，往往在划成份中，提到他伪保长如何压迫人等，拿此来作为划阶级的条件，是不合适的。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（白错工作组、联合办公室）
    编者按：
    白错村划阶级过程中，发扬民主这一点上，是做得好的。但工作组同志在实现党的领导作用方面，从来稿看是不够的。表现在：一、在上中农问题上，群众没有把它当作分别富农与中农（即剥削阶级与独立劳动者）一个重要问题来考虑，而是着重于由中农里挤上中农，这就会发生一种错觉，象胡小来“一见上中农就害怕”，把自己的阵营弄乱了。二、地主富农成份的成立，在来稿中不明确。但根据郝树德评议结果是“他把好地变成坏地，不能算上中农，是富农”来看（这种说法是错误的），可能其他已划成地主富农的仍有问题，值得考虑。
    此外，胡茂堂的成份的决定也有毛病。希再研究一下。总之，在决定一个具体人的成份时，要十分谨慎，对群众不正确的意见，要随时加以说服，这样才能达到“没有一个人被屈”。
