　　What Lessons Did the Gao Ping Production Arrangement Give Us?
    Today, this newspaper publishes that the Gao Ping County Committee convened an enlarged meeting of village cadres to eliminate ideological obstacles and mobilize spring plowing, only to find the phenomenon without grasping the essence, and failed to overcome the chaotic phenomenon that still exists in many villages of the county, which greatly affected the spring plowing movement. It cannot be denied that this situation is general. If it does not attract the attention of various regions, immediately become clear in leadership, take resolute measures, and strictly correct it, then this year's spring plowing will inevitably suffer serious losses, which should not be and is not allowed.
    From the Gao Ping facts, there are two lessons worth noting in various regions:
    First, it is not enough to rely solely on holding a meeting to mobilize (although this is necessary) to carry out and promote a work or a movement. After the meeting, timely and regular inspections should be made, problems should be solved at any time, experiences should be disseminated, and errors should be corrected to ensure the smooth development of the work, so that old errors will not be repeated and new deviations will not occur. It is not enough to just hold a meeting and say that the cadres' thinking has been cleared and the movement has been carried out. Just because the leadership is clear does not mean that the cadres below are clear, let alone that the masses are all clear. If timely and regular inspections are not carried out, resulting in the failure of the work or the emergence of new deviations and new errors, and a review meeting is held every month or two to three months to correct the errors, the work has already suffered losses, which should not be. Gao Ping held a mobilization meeting of several hundred village cadres on March 7th, and then held a mobilization meeting of eight hundred village cadres on the 1st of this month. The scale is not small, but between the two meetings, the movement could not be carried out and the chaotic situation was not broken. The main reason for this should be attributed to the failure to conduct timely inspections and to make specific leadership. Otherwise, why didn't the Gao Ping County Party Committee make timely corrections to the continued random struggle against the middle peasants in some villages? Why only give a light description of the facts at the conference, without a painful review of the serious phenomena that have occurred, such as beating the middle peasants to death? From the perspective of the leadership of a county party committee, it is wrong to be negligent and tolerant of erroneous performances that violate the party's policies, and not to conduct sharp and irreconcilable struggles.
    Second, in guiding work and stipulating guidelines, the leadership must be specific, clear, and resolute in attitude, and must clearly state what is permissible and what is not permissible. Things that are permissible must be explained very clearly, and the lower levels must be allowed to do them with a free hand, and they must be implemented among the masses; and things that are not permissible must be stipulated, and no one can do them. Anyone who does them should be punished. For example, the line of taking the poor and hired peasants as the backbone to unite with all the middle peasants is a complete class line clearly stipulated by the party. Only this line can be implemented in land reform and production, and this line cannot be destroyed. In Gao Ping villages, many of the poor and hired peasant groups established last winter were controlled by bad cadres and bad elements, and they randomly sealed the doors of middle peasants, which is not allowed. Until recently, the Gao Ping County Committee still did not make strict criticisms and reviews of this matter in principle, and did not point out the direction, make decisions, and educate the leaders, cadres, and masses, which showed the ambiguity of policy thinking. Therefore, it cannot truly play a decisive role in breaking ideological obstacles and developing spring plowing.
    The Gao Ping fact is only one example. It can be affirmed that many counties in our region also have similar situations. Meetings have been held to arrange work, but it must be admitted that the vast majority of regions have not eliminated the obstacles to production. If we do not pay attention, we will suffer a great loss in the future!
    At present, the time for spring plowing is imminent, and production obstacles must be eliminated. We hope that the leadership in various regions will firmly and clearly proceed from the actual local conditions, stipulate guidelines, allocate forces, and earnestly promote the spring plowing movement. Any obstacles that hinder the development of production must be removed quickly! In the past period, many leaders and some cadres have focused their attention on land reform work, and the use of forces and the allocation of cadres have also shown attention to land reform. It is necessary to create typical experiences in land reform. However, it is wrong to neglect the leadership of production work and to neglect the use of resolute attitude to eliminate production obstacles. We suggest that the whole region: clear heads, immediately attach importance to production leadership, and create a mass movement for the spring plowing movement. First of all, the leadership is required to study and master the party's guidelines well, and to clearly guide the development of the movement. The instructions of the Central Committee and the Central Bureau have clearly pointed out the importance of spring plowing. Whoever neglects production leadership (that is, even villages promoting land reform must pay attention to combining with spring plowing) will make mistakes; second, it is necessary to promote the attitude of being responsible to the party and the people. Spring plowing production is the requirement of the people and also the revolutionary requirement to win the war. Anything that is found to be contrary to this requirement and hinders the development of production should be raised at any time with a responsible attitude for timely resolution. This spring, the weather is favorable, and whether there will be a good harvest depends on how well the various regions promote it! Production is already seasonal, and any further delay will result in losses!

### 高平生产布置给了我们什么教训？

　　高平生产布置给了我们什么教训？
    今天本报揭载高平县委会召开村干扩大会，扫除思想障碍，动员春耕，只找到了现象，没有抓住本质，不能克服直至现在仍在该县不少村庄存在的混乱现象，使春耕运动受到了很大影响。这种情形，不容否认的是带有一般性，如果不能引起各地注意，立即在领导上清醒起来，采取坚决措施，加以严格纠正，则今年春耕必定会遭受严重损失，那是不应该，而且是不容许的。
    从高平事实中，有两点教训值得引起各地注意：
    第一、开展与推动一个工作、一个运动，只靠开一个会动员一下（这虽是必要的）是不行的。在开过会之后，应该及时的经常的作检查，应该随时解决问题、传播经验、纠正错误，才能保证工作的顺利开展，使旧有错误不致重犯，新的偏向不再发生。只靠开一个会，就说干部思想打通了，运动开展了。仅领导上通了，不等于下边干部通了，更不等于群众都通了。如不作及时的经常的检查，致使工作搞不开或者又产生了新偏向新错误，等一个月或两三个月开一个检讨会，纠正一次错误，工作上已受到了损失，是不应该的。高平三月七日开了几百个村干的动员会，又于本月一日召开八百村干的动员会，规模不算不大，但在两个会议之间，运动搞不开，混乱局面没有打破，这主要原因应该归咎在未曾进行及时的检查，未曾作具体的领导，不然若干村仍乱斗中农，为什么没见高平县委作及时的纠正？为什么只在大会上轻描淡写的叙述一下事实，不见对已发生的严重现象，如打死中农等，有痛切的检讨？这从一个县党委的领导来说：对违犯党的政策的错误表现疏忽容忍，不作尖锐的不调和的斗争是不应该的。
    第二、领导上指导工作，规定方针，必须具体，必须明确，态度必须坚决，要说清许可做的事情，不许可做的事情。许可做的事情，要讲得十分清楚，放手让下面去做，并贯彻到群众中去；而不许可做的事情，一定要作出规定，谁也不能做，谁作了就应受处分。比如以贫雇为骨干团结全体中农的路线，是党所明确规定的完整的阶级路线，在土改中生产中都只许贯彻这一路线，不能破坏这一路线。高平各村，去冬成立的贫雇组，不少为坏干部与坏分子所掌握，乱封中农的门，这是不容许的。高平县委直至最近对此事仍不从原则上作严格的批评和检讨，不指出方针，作出决定，教育领导，教育干部和群众，是表现了政策思想的模糊，因之，就不能真正在打破思想障碍开展春耕上起决定作用。
    高平这一事实不过只是一例，肯定的说，我区不少县份也有此种类似情形，开会布置是有了，但必须承认绝大多数地区没有把生产障碍解除了，如不注意将来会吃大亏！
    目下，春耕时机已迫，生产障碍必须排除，我们希望各地领导上坚定明确地从当地实际情况出发，规定方针，配备力量，认真把春耕运动推动起来。凡妨害生产发展的障碍一定要把它迅速去掉！过去一个时期，不论领导及一部分干部，不少把视线及注意力都放在了土改工作上面，运用力量及配备干部也表现了重视土改。为了创造土改典型经验，这是必要的。但因之而忽视生产工作的领导，忽视用坚决态度扫除生产障碍是不对的。我们建议全区：清醒头脑，即刻重视生产领导，把春耕运动造成群众性的运动。首先、要求领导上，好好研究与掌握党的方针，清醒的指导运动发展，中央及中央局指示，都明确指出了春耕的重要性，谁忽视生产领导（即推行土改村也须注意与春耕结合），谁就要犯错误；第二、要发扬对党对人民负责的态度，春耕生产是人民的要求，也是争取战争胜利的革命要求，凡发现与这一要求相违背，妨害生产发展的东西，都应该随时以负责的态度提出来作及时解决。今春风调雨顺，能否有一个好收成，就靠各地推动得如何而定了！生产已是季节，再要耽误，就要受到损失了！
