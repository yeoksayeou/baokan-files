[Zuoquan News] On April 7th, Zuoquan convened a second county-wide production meeting for all districts to inspect the production situation in each village and identify remaining problems in spring plowing.

	1. Due to insufficient publicity, the masses still have doubts about the Land Law policy. Middle peasants are afraid of having their land divided and prioritize sideline occupations over agriculture. In Guyi and Weize in the seventh district, middle peasants believe that they can maintain their livelihoods through sideline production without touching their movable property, so they request loans to buy donkeys and mules. 2. The "lying down" mentality of village cadres is still very serious. Niu Laotai said, "In the past, cadres made guarantees; now, cadres are told to hand over their seals. Being a cadre is unlucky now! Last year, honored soldiers struggled against cadres; now, poor and hired peasants are struggling against cadres." The cadres of Dananzhuang Village sit around feeling depressed every day. They want to lead production but are afraid of making mistakes. The cadres of Songjiazhuang Village believe that "patriots and loyal people don't have good endings." Less than one-third of the village's manure has been delivered to the fields, and the whole village is currently busy building houses. Cadres who illegally occupy fruits calculate accounts and gamble heavily every day. The village head of Zhuning, etc., lost a total of 300,000 yuan. Furthermore, some fake poor peasant leagues are making trouble in the villages, so good cadres dare not act, and bad cadres are in power and act recklessly. Honest poor peasants cannot stand it, feel dissatisfied in their hearts, but dare not speak out. Middle peasants are afraid, creating confusion. To address the above problems, in addition to publicizing policies to stabilize emotions, villages should absorb honest peasants, re-establish spring plowing committees, stop the activities of impure elements, and persuade honest peasants not to follow them blindly and to concentrate on production. Each district will also draw three people from the land reform villages to come back and strengthen the leadership of production. In terms of mutual aid, in the past, most villages were not voluntary, and last year's accounts were not settled clearly. Cadres took advantage of the mutual aid groups. It was decided that in the future, the organization of mutual aid groups must be voluntary and sincere, ensuring that no one suffers losses. Groups should not be too large to overcome the past shortcomings of combining handicraftsmen and agriculture in mutual aid. (Office)

　　推动村干教育群众左权检查春耕领导
    【左权消息】左权在四月七号，又召开了全县各区二次生产会议，检查各村生产情况，春耕中还存在啥问题？
    一、由于宣传不深入，群众对土地法政策仍有怀疑，中农怕分走地，轻农重副。七区故驿、苇则，中农认为不动浮财，就要求贷款，买驴买骡，用副业生产来维持生活。二、各村干部躺倒思想仍很严重。牛老太说：“过去是干部保证，现在是叫干部交印。当干部倒运啦！去年是荣军斗干部，现在又是贫雇斗干部。”大南庄村干每日坐着苦闷，自己也想领导生产，又不敢，怕作下错。宋家庄干部，认为“保国忠良没下场”，全村粪还没送到地三分之一，现在全村正闹盖房。多占果实坏干部每日光算帐、大赌钱，竹宁村长等共输了三十万元。再就是一些假贫雇团在村里瞎干，闹的好干部不敢动，坏干部掌权胡干，老实贫农看不下眼，肚里不满，嘴里不敢吭，中农害怕，形成混乱。对以上问题各村除宣传政策安定情绪外，吸收老实农民，重新健全组织春耕委员会，停止不纯分子的活动，对老实农民提出说服，不要跟他们瞎走，安心生产。各区再从土改村中抽三个人，回来加强领导生产。在互助上，各村过去多不是自愿，去年帐目也没算清，干部在互助组里讨便宜。决定今后组织互助组，一定要自愿、碰心事，作到互相不吃亏。组不应过大，克服过去手工业工人和农业一并互助的毛病。（办公室）
