Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Reports from various sources: More than 10,000 police officers and sympathizers in Alexandria, Egypt, held demonstrations on the 5th in response to the decision by all Egyptian police officers to strike in Cairo on the 4th to demand higher salaries. Due to the Egyptian government's suppression by military force, the demonstrations quickly escalated into bloody riots. According to Agence France-Presse, 30 people were killed and 200 injured in the riots, and more than 100 houses were burned. During the riots, order in Alexandria was disrupted, and the poor flooded into stores to seize goods, with crowds gathering in the streets. To support the police officers, textile workers went on strike, and students from Oilouk University and various primary and secondary schools boycotted classes. Three-quarters of the police in Cairo also went on strike, and 2,000 people held a demonstration rally at a club near Luo Ya. The Egyptian government has declared a state of emergency nationwide. On the 6th, although Alexandria police officers decided to resume work under high government pressure, strict martial law remained in effect in Alexandria.
