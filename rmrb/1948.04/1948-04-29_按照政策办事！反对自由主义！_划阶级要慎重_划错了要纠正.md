    Act According to Policy! Oppose Liberalism!
    Be Cautious When Classifying Class!
    Correct Mistakes When They Are Made!
    [This Newspaper's News] According to the "Heshun Xiaobao" on April 19th: In the first class classification in Dongguan, Heshun District 1, the landlords and rich peasants accounted for 10.95% of the total number of households. At the time of the classification, the leading ideology was "classifying more as feudal can get more things for the masses," and "classifying as rich peasant is easier for the masses to accept." After a meeting to review and criticize "leftist" emotions, they still did not consider calmly when revising the components; they did not dare to boldly deny the past, and the second classification was still not realistic enough, with the landlords and rich peasants accounting for 7.68% of the total number of households. In the third reclassification, the landlords and rich peasants became 6.73% of the total number of households; however, they still said that there was one "bankrupt landlord" household. The newspaper did not specify the situation of this household; but judging only from the fact that there is such a class, the third classification must still have problems. According to the central government's regulations on class classification, there is no such component as "bankrupt landlord."
    According to reports from Comrades Song Anxiang and Sun Chengwen of the Yuanshi County Committee: The work group in Chichi Village, that county, conducted ideological mobilization for the masses before leading them to classify class in this way: "Finding the enemy first before fighting, you cannot fight if you cannot find the enemy"; "Launch class classification learning under the masses' demand to find the enemy." This village is a new district, and classifying landlords and rich peasants is part of the purpose of class classification; however, it cannot be isolated and regarded as the sole purpose. The complete purpose of class classification is to put everyone in an appropriate position according to the relations of production, so that everyone knows how to live in a new democratic society. Our party's policy is to resolutely rely on the poor and hired peasants, consolidate the unity with the middle peasants, eliminate the landlords and old-style rich peasants as a whole class, and give each specific person a way out separately. In class classification, it is necessary to distinguish between the enemy, ourselves, and our friends at the same time; such simple "finding the enemy" can easily classify friends and our own people as the enemy. To say "find the enemy" in general terms can also easily be misunderstood as attacking individuals, rather than eliminating the landlord class. Some of the masses hoped to classify more households as landlords and rich peasants in order to obtain more gains; the "leftist" emotions of some cadres in the work group were also combined with the "leftist" emotions of the masses, such as worker Guo ××, who was happy to classify a household as landlord or rich peasant; he felt that it was a waste of effort if it was not landlord or rich peasant. Under the control of this emotion, they distorted the facts and deliberately expanded the scope of exploitation of the classified, counting one short-term worker as three workers, and a long-term worker who only contributed half a labor force as a whole one. As a result, the landlords and rich peasants accounted for 17.4% of the total number of households in the village. After the classification, when the work group held a meeting to study the problems of this class classification, many people initially thought that "the classification was not bad"; when the leaders re-read the central government's regulations on class classification to everyone, some workers turned their heads and said: "No, if we classify like this, there will be no landlords or rich peasants, how can the poor turn over?" They still do not realize the harm of such "leftism" to the masses.
    Also, Comrades Shang Feng and others said in "Introducing Several Experiences in Reviewing Class Status in Donggou (belonging to Shahe)": "As a result of the poor and hired peasants' sharp comparison of suffering, history, and root causes in the review, many alien elements mixed within the peasants were cleared out. ... The class situation in the village before the review was very special, with only ten feudal households, accounting for only 8.54% of the total number of households; after the review, the feudal class increased by more than one time, accounting for 19.8% of the total number of households; ... the number of middle peasants increased, and the number of poor and hired peasants decreased, clearing out other classes mixed in the poor and hired peasant class." It can be affirmed that such a "review of class" was carried out under extremely "leftist" emotions, and the methods and standards (comparing suffering, history, and finding roots), purpose and results (forcing feudal status, expanding the scope of attack to nearly 20%), are completely wrong.
    The reporter has seen many questions about class classification in newspapers and submissions from various places that are worth raising for research and discussion. The above are just a few examples, and similar situations exist in other places. From these situations, it can be seen that there are many errors in class classification in various places, generally being too "leftist" and deliberately increasing the components. The reason for the errors is due to the combination of the "leftist" emotions of the staff and the "leftist" emotions of some of the masses, following this part of the masses' adventurous, selfish, and blind thinking, becoming serious tailism. Under the control of this "leftist" emotion, the phenomenon of disregarding policy and ignoring policy also arises:
    Being Clever and Creating Names.
    In addition to the "bankrupt landlord" classified by Heshun mentioned earlier, Shahe also classified "hooligan" and other components. Some even added words such as "pure" and "old" to "landlord." Class divisions in Lucunying and other places in Cixian County include: landlord, rich peasant, upper-middle peasant, middle peasant, lower-middle peasant, poor peasant, extremely poor, and hired worker. Some places even divide poor peasants into upper-poor peasants, middle-poor peasants, and lower-poor peasants. Shangguan Village in Shahe even classified a "poor bully" component. The Dongguan work group in Pinging even said: "There are many types of poor peasants in Chengguan, and the masses cannot name them, and ask the working comrades to explain." The working comrades then explained: "The poor, peddlers, coolies, and freelancers are all poor peasants." In many other places, affluent middle peasants are regarded as a separate class. These are all inconsistent with the central government's regulations on class classification. Some of them randomly add words, which are meaningless and only express "leftist" emotions. Dividing middle peasants and poor peasants into upper, middle, and lower levels is mostly due to ill intentions, either wanting some middle peasants to take out more things, or wanting some poor peasants to lose the rights they should have. And as a result, it will cause mutual alienation within one's own camp, and even cause internal disputes, to the point of attacking one's own people.
    Not According to Standards, Increasing Components.
    The Heshun District 1 work group reviewed: When they classified the landlord and rich peasant classes, they followed the principle of "looking at three years before and three years after 1942." They did not adequately explain to the masses that landlords who participated in major labor before the establishment of the democratic government and rich peasants who stopped exploitation accounting for more than a quarter of their total income for a full year should have their components changed. When calculating income, the food and wages of hired workers were not calculated. The masses also mostly have "leftist" emotions, such as: some places in Shahe counting planting labor-saving crops without hiring people or wasteland as "exploitation." Some in Licheng even counted land bought last year; counted sheep labor for five household items as one household's use. Tinghepou even classified those who exceeded the average yield by a little as affluent middle peasants. The situation of comparing history, comparing life, comparing personality, looking at grain piles, looking at politics, and looking at human nature also still exists in many places in Yuanshi. In the initial class classification in Baicuo Village, Shahe, Hu Guangcheng said that he was a middle peasant, but some people disagreed, saying: "You have more than 30 mu of land and five people in your family, you are an upper-middle peasant." Many places regard middle peasants with affluent lives as affluent middle peasants, regardless of whether there is minor exploitation. These class classifications that do not follow standards are all aimed at increasing components. Many work groups have reviewed this, corrected or timely criticized the incorrect opinions of some of the masses, which is good. However, some staff members follow the incorrect opinions of the masses. As the Heshun work group reviewed, some staff members "searched for reasons in many ways to squeeze affluent middle peasants out of the middle peasants." Some land reform workers in Changzhi also intentionally raised ordinary middle peasants to affluent middle peasants, saying: "The land of ordinary middle peasants does not move; if we do not find more affluent middle peasants, where will we get land to extract from?"
    According to the spirit of the central government's regulations on class classification, the reason for clearly distinguishing between rich peasants and middle peasants, and calling farmers who work themselves and have some exploitation, but whose exploitation income does not exceed one-quarter of their total income, affluent middle peasants, is to protect the middle peasants. However, the purpose of some staff members in classifying affluent middle peasant components or dividing middle peasants into upper, middle, and lower levels is to expand the scope of attack and infringe upon the middle peasants.
    There are also those who deliberately do not allow the classified to grasp the class classification standards and harm people. For example, in Xiecun, Yuanshi, one household actually produced one stone per mu; taking advantage of his unfamiliarity with the class classification standards, they asked him to report it himself; he was certainly unwilling to report more, reporting it as seven dou. Calculated in this way, the exploitation income exceeded one-quarter of the total income. (This has been corrected after the staff explained it to the masses.) In one household in Heshun District 1, the income from spinning ropes was five stones of grain, but he himself was afraid of reporting too much, reporting it as two stones; he also had other exploitation income; thus, underreporting the total income resulted in the scope of exploitation being as high as more than 30%. Some staff members then let the masses classify him according to this, regardless of the facts. Some people also said: "He reported it himself, who is to blame?" This style is even more egregious; the purpose is also to expand the scope of attack.
    Doing so can only disrupt the revolutionary camp, help the enemy, isolate ourselves, and is not beneficial to the masses.
    Unwilling to Correct Past Mistakes.
    There are also those who are unwilling to correct past mistakes and dare not boldly admit mistakes. When Licheng Tinghepou classified these households, some people said: "If we classify them as middle peasants, we will have to return the fruits!" Others said: "According to the standards, he is an affluent middle peasant, but he was killed in the struggle two years ago, what should we do?" Fearing to return the fruits and fearing to incur blame, they never wanted to correct people's components according to the actual situation. Some staff members also have this idea, and are unwilling to correct mistakes, fearing damage to their own "prestige." These comrades have forgotten the words in the General Program of the Party Constitution: "The Communist Party of China should not cover up the errors and shortcomings in its work. ... The Communist Party of China opposes the attitude of arrogance, fear of admitting one's own mistakes, and fear of criticism and self-criticism."
    Confusing Politics and Economics.
    The 50-day work summary of the Dongqingbei Village work group in Ping Shun District 5 mentioned: "When classifying the components of cadres, most people were afraid. For example, public security officer Song Gengze was originally a 'bankrupt landlord,' some said he was a poor peasant, and some said he was a middle peasant. Song Renshan stood up and said: 'He does not work during the day and works at night; after his family went bankrupt, his father and he still do not work, robbing and stealing people to eat easy meals, he is clearly a bankrupt landlord, why do you say he is a middle peasant?' He was so scared that he shivered all over, and said: 'Even if I die this time, everyone will know.'" There are several problems here: 1. According to the regulations, there is no such component as "bankrupt landlord." 2. It was not explained whether he was originally a landlord; even if a landlord went bankrupt, if he had not lived the same life as a landlord for several years (one year before the establishment of the local democratic government and five years after the establishment), he could not be considered a landlord. If he had relied on robbing and stealing people as his main source of livelihood for three consecutive years, he could only be considered a vagrant; but it was said that he "eats easy meals," which is too vague, and doing some light work does not necessarily count as an improper method. 3. Someone stood up to rebuke him like this, and scared him to tremble all over, and also said that most people were afraid of Song Gengze, which is incomprehensible. In another material, it was also mentioned that "Song Gengze was determined to die" in the rectification of the Party, which shows that the work group applied excessive and undue "pressure" to the Party member cadres. In class classification, Song Gengze's other faults as a cadre were clearly mixed with the classification of his component, at least in the emotions of some of the masses and staff members. This is very dangerous and is bound to make serious mistakes.
    The Yuanshi Chichi Village work group mentioned in its review of the problems of the initial class classification that they had classified Hou Heixiao and Zhao Baoyuan, middle peasants who had served as puppet Baozhang and puppet Lianbao chiefs, as landlords; later, this was corrected, which is right and correct. Class classification can only be based on economic conditions, the ownership of means of production, and the relations of production; mixing in any other conditions is wrong. Not separating politics and economics will also mess up one's own camp.
    Lack of Full Democracy.
    When Yuanshi Chichi Village initially classified class, under the pressure of the hat of "not allowing the sheltering of landlords and rich peasants," the following phenomenon occurred: although most people said that a certain household was a middle peasant, a few dared to say that it was a rich peasant; if a few people said that a certain household was a rich peasant first, even if most people thought it was a middle peasant, they would not dare to say anything. Therefore, when reading out some households, they did not talk about the facts, but only said "landlord" or "rich peasant," and it was "passed." (This has been corrected later.)
    In a village in Changzhi, an old man was classified as a rich peasant, and he disagreed and defended himself. The masses then questioned him with harsh words and stern expressions. At this time, instead of guiding everyone to consider calmly and collect more materials for research, the staff took a simple approach, threatening the old man and saying: "If you don't tell the truth, we will send you to the People's Court!" The next day, the old man jumped into a well and committed suicide.
    When Cixian Lucunying initially classified class and discussed Zheng Sheng, many poor peasants only said "he is an affluent middle peasant" from the side, but could not provide any evidence. Some staff members followed the masses, and expressed great dissatisfaction with those who were determined to be affluent middle peasants and requested to lower their components, rather than submitting it to the masses for reconsideration based on the facts. This made those who were wrongly classified lose the courage to defend themselves.
    When Wuan Duzhuang Village classified Du Zhen, he reported himself: "I have 86 and a half mu of land, 43 rooms, two heads of livestock, lending money, looking for hired workers, and I don't work myself, I am a landlord." Many people then rebuked him and said: "It's not enough for you to say you are a landlord, you have to talk about your exploitation!" Others said: "If you don't say it, you still won't bow your head!"
    These are all manifestations of a lack of democratic spirit, and it is easy to wrong people. It is generally believed that class classification is class struggle, which is correct. However, the struggle during class classification should be based on facts, reasoning, and evidence; raising the class consciousness of the masses in class classification should also be strictly in accordance with the standards stipulated by the central government, otherwise, it will blur the class consciousness of the masses and make it impossible to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. It is necessary to determine the components according to policy and actual situation, and not just decide the components by using the majority to overwhelm the minority. When discussing class, we must allow anyone to freely express dissenting opinions, argue with each other, and present evidence in a spirit of complete democracy and without any coercion. When disputes cannot be resolved, we must conduct further investigation and hold meetings for discussion again. Some of our comrades often combine the old style of commandism and "leftist" emotions in this problem, causing errors. Not only should we be very cautious, serious, and implement the democratic spirit in the process of class classification, but even after the three-list finalization, we should allow those who disagree to present their evidence and file a complaint with the higher-level Party and government organs.
    According to the central government's regulations, the order of the three-list finalization should be: the first list should be discussed and passed by the entire meeting of the poor peasant group or the peasant association group household by household; the second list should be discussed and passed by the entire meeting of the peasant association household by household; the third list should be discussed and passed by the village congress one by one. Many places do not follow these regulations, some only let the poor peasant group pass or only absorb a few middle peasants to discuss; Shahe stipulates that the final decision is reviewed and passed by the peasant representative conference. As far as the matter of class classification is concerned, this is not enough to fully promote democracy.
    The reporter believes that the above deviations are all due to not acting in accordance with the Party's policies; some are arbitrarily modifying or distorting the Party's policies, and some are muddle-headed and have not studied the Party's policies well, which are all manifestations of liberalism. This liberalistic phenomenon of not implementing the Party's correct policies and abusing one's own erroneous policies needs to be corrected and must be corrected. Some work groups in some places have begun to correct this, which is good. But this is not enough; staff members who have violated the policy should be given severe criticism; those who have made mistakes in a muddle-headed way can no longer be muddle-headed in the future, and must study the Party's policies well and investigate the actual situation well. Fumbling around is dangerous. In order to guarantee the victory of the revolution, we must be very clear-headed.

    按照政策办事！反对自由主义！
    划阶级要慎重
    划错了要纠正
    【本报消息】据四月十九日“和顺小报”载：和顺一区东关第一次划阶级，划出的地主富农占总户数百分之十·九五；在划的时候，领导思想是“多划封建可以多拿东西给群众”，“划成富农在群众中好通过”。经开会检讨批判了“左”倾情绪，但到订正成份时，仍不冷静考虑；不敢大胆否定过去，第二次划仍然不够十分实事求是，划出的地主富农占总户数百分之七·六八。第三次再划，地主富农又成了占总户数百分之六·七三；可是还说其中有“破地主”一户。这一户是什么情况，小报上没有说明；但只从划的有这么一个阶层判断，第三次划的一定还有问题；按照中央划阶级的规定，是没有“破地主”这个成份的。
    据元氏县委会宋安祥、孙成文两同志报导：该县池村工作组领导群众划阶级前是这样作思想动员的：“打仗先找敌人，找不见敌人不能打”；“在群众找敌人的要求下展开划阶级学习。”这个村是新区，把地主、富农划出来是划阶级的目的的一部分；不过，不能孤立起来当成唯一的目的。划阶级的完整的目的，是把每个人按生产关系放在适当的位置上，使每个人知道自己在新民主主义社会中如何生活。我们党的政策，对贫雇是坚决的依靠，对中农是巩固的团结，对地主、旧式富农要作为整个阶级来消灭，对具体的人则都也分别给以出路。在划阶级中要同时把敌、我、友分清；这样单纯的“找敌人”，很容易把朋友和自己人划到敌人那边去。笼统的说“找敌人”，也容易误会为打击个人，而不是消灭地主阶级。部分群众是希望多划出几户地主、富农，为的是多得果实；工作组某些干部“左”倾情绪也和群众的“左”倾情绪结合了起来，如工作员郭××，划出一户地主、富农就高兴；不是地富就觉得白费了一道工夫。在这情绪支配下，就歪曲事实，故意扩大被划者的剥削面，把一个短工顶三个工，只顶半个劳力的长工也算成了一整个。结果划出的地主、富农占全村户数百分之十七·四。划过后工作组开会研究这次划阶级的毛病时，开头很多人还认为“划的不坏”；当领导上再读中央划阶级规定给大家听时，有些工作员把头一扭，说：“不行，这样子划就没地主、富农了，穷人怎么翻身？”还是认识不到这样“左”对群众的危害。
    还有尚枫等同志在“介绍东沟（属沙河）审查阶层的几点经验”一文中说：“在审查中经过贫雇尖锐的比苦、比历史、找根子的结果，使许多混杂在农民内部的异己分子被清除出来了。……该村在审查以前的阶层情况是十分特殊的，封建层只有十户，仅占总户数百分之八·五四；审查后，封建层增加了一倍多，占全村户数百分之十九·八；……中农增多，贫雇减少，将混杂在贫雇层里的其他阶层清除了。”可以肯定的说，这样的“审查阶级”更是在极“左”的情绪下进行的，划的方法和标准（比苦、比历史、找根子），目的和结果（硬挤封建，扩大打击面到将近百分之二十），都是完全错误的。
    记者从各地报纸和来稿中，看到不少关于划阶级的问题是值得提出研究讨论的。以上只举出这几个例子，其他各地同类的情形还有。从这些情况，可以看出，各地划阶级中是有不少错误的，一般的是过“左”，故意提高成份。发生错误的原因，则是由于工作人员的“左”倾情绪和部分群众“左”的情绪相结合，跟着这一部分群众冒险的、自私的、盲目思想乱跑，成为严重的尾巴主义。在这“左”的情绪支配下，也就产生了不顾政策、漠视政策的现象：
    自作聪明，巧立名目。
    除了前面说过的和顺划的“破地主”外，沙河还划出了“流氓”等成份。有的还在“地主”上面加上“纯”、“旧”等字样。磁县路村营等地阶级划分有：地主、富农、上中农、中农、下中农、贫农、赤贫、雇工。还有的地方把贫农再分为上贫农、中贫农、下贫农。沙河上关村还曾划出“穷恶霸”成份。平定东关工作组还说：“城关贫农阶层有多种，群众起不了名字，要求工作同志说说。”工作同志就给说了：“贫民、小贩、苦力、自由职业者，都是贫农阶层的。”还有很多地方把富裕中农认为一个单独的阶级。这些都是不合乎中央划阶级的规定的。其中有的乱加字样，是毫无意义，只表现了“左”的情绪。把中农、贫农再分为上、中、下，则大半更是由于不怀好意，或是想叫有些中农多拿出东西来，或者想叫有些贫农失去贫农应有的权利。而其结果，将会引起自己阵营内部的互相隔阂，甚至引起内部纠纷，以至打击了自己人。
    不按标准，提高成份。
    和顺一区工作团检讨：他们在划地主、富农阶级时，是按“民国三十一年前看三年，后看三年”。对于民主政府成立前地主参加主要劳动、富农停止占总收入四分之一以上的剥削满一年就改变成份对群众说明得不够。在计算收入时，未计算雇工的吃喝和工资。群众也大都是有“左”的情绪的，如：沙河有的地方把种省工庄稼不雇人或荒了地的都算“剥削”。黎城还有的把去年才买的地也算上；把五家伙用的羊工算一家用的。停河铺甚至把超过平均产量一点的都划成富裕中农。元氏有的村子把被划户的劳力算的低，把长工短工劳力计算得高。各地比历史、比生活、比人格、看谷堆、看政治、看人性的情形也还是不少。沙河白错村初划阶级中，胡广成说他自己是中农，有些人不同意，说：“你有三十多亩地，五口人，是个上中农。”很多地方把生活富裕的中农就看作富裕中农，也不管有无轻微剥削。这些不按标准的划阶级，目的都是为了提高成份。很多工作组对这都作了检讨，纠正或及时批评了部分群众的不正确意见，这是好的。但有些工作人员则做了群众不正确意见的尾巴。如和顺工作团检讨，有些工作人员就是“多方面寻找理由在中农里挤富裕中农”。长治有些土改工作人员也有意的把一般中农提高到富裕中农，他们说：“一般中农土地不动；要不多找富裕中农，上哪里去抽地？”
    按中央划阶级规定的精神，所以要明确划出富农与中农的界限，把自己劳动而有一些剥削，但剥削收入不超过总收入四分之一的农民叫做富裕中农，是为了保护中农。而有些工作人员划富裕中农成份或把中农分作上、中、下，目的则是为了扩大打击面，侵害中农。
    还有故意不让被划户掌握划阶级标准而坑害人的。如元氏解村，有一户每亩产量实为一石；趁他对划阶级标准还不熟悉，让他自报；他一定不愿多报，报成七斗。这样算，剥削收入就超过总收入的四分之一了。（后经工作人员向群众解释，已经纠正。）和顺一区有一户，自己纺绳收入有五石粮食，他自己怕多报了，报成二石；他另外还有剥削收入；这样少报了总收入，结果剥削面大到百分之三十多。有的工作人员这时也就放任群众按这给他定成份，而不管事实。还有人说：“他自报的，怨谁？”这种作风是更恶劣的；目的也是为了扩大打击面。
    这样作，只能打乱革命阵营，帮助敌人，孤立自己，对群众是没好处的。
    过去错了，不愿订正。
    还有的对过去斗错了的不愿订正过来，不敢大胆承认错误。黎城停河铺划这些户时，就有人说：“要是给人家划成中农，还得退果实哩！”还有的说：“按标准人家是个富裕中农，可是前年斗争打死了人家了，这可怎么办？”怕退果实，怕落埋怨，所以总不想按实际把人家的成份订正过来。有些工作人员也有这种思想，划错了就不愿订正，怕有损自己的“威信”。这些同志忘记了党章总纲上的话：“中国共产党应该不掩盖自己工作中的错误与缺点。………中国共产党反对那种自高自大，害怕承认自己错误，害怕批评与自我批评的情绪。”
    政治和经济混淆不分。
    平顺五区东青北村工作组的五十天工作总结中提到：“在划干部成份时，有大部分人都害怕。如公安员宋庚则本来是个‘破产地主’，有的说是贫农，有的说是中农。宋仁山站起来说：‘他是白天不劳动黑夜劳动；他家破产后，他父亲和他到现在也不劳动，抢人偷人吃轻巧饭，明明是破产地主，为啥说他是中农？’吓的他浑身上下圪擞，并说：‘我今次就死了大家也知道’。”这里面有好几个问题：一、按规定，没有“破产地主”这个成份。二、原来是不是地主也没有交待；即使是地主破产了，假若过的已经不是和地主相同的生活过了若干年（当地民主政府成立前一年，成立后五年），也就不能算地主，如果靠抢人偷人为主要生活来源连续三年了，也只能算个游民；但又说是“吃轻巧饭”，这说得太含混，做有些轻巧活也不一定就算不正当方法。三、有人站起来这样斥责他，而且把他吓得浑身发抖，还说大部分人都害怕宋庚则，这不可解。在另一个材料中还提到在整党中“宋庚则就下决心要死”，可见工作组对党员干部是施用了过重的不应有的“压力”的。在划阶级中，显然是把宋庚则当干部时别的过错和划他的成份混在一起了，至少在部分群众和工作人员的情绪上是这样的。这样是很危险的，是必然会犯严重错误的。
    元氏池村工作组检讨初划阶级的毛病中有一条提到：把当过伪保长、伪联保主任的中农侯黑小、赵保元划成了地主；后来已作了纠正，这是应该的，正确的。划阶级只能根据经济情况，根据生产手段的占有状况和生产关系；掺杂一点别的条件都是不对的。不把政治和经济分开，也同样会弄乱自己的阵营。
    没有充分的发扬民主。
    元氏池村最初划阶级时，在“不许包庇地主、富农”的帽子压制下，产生了这样一种现象：虽然多数人说某户是中农，少数人敢说是富农；如果先有少数人说某户是富农，即使多数人认为是中农也都不敢吭了。因此，念到有些户时，不谈事实，光说个“地主”“富农”，就“通过”了。（后来已提出纠正。）
    长治某村有个老汉被划成富农，他不同意而进行申辩。群众再厉言厉色地追问他，工作人员这时不是诱导大家冷静考虑，再搜集材料研究，而是采取简单办法，威吓老汉说：“你不说老实话，送你到人民法庭！”第二天，老汉跳井自杀了。
    磁县路村营初划阶级讨论到郑生时，有好多贫农光在一边说“是富裕中农”，但都提不出什么证据来。而有些工作人员，跟着群众跑，对定为富裕中农要求降低成份的人则表示出很不满意，而不是提交群众根据事实再作考虑。这就使订错成份的人也失去了申辩的勇气。
    武安杜庄村划到杜真时，他自报：“我有地八十六亩半，房四十三间，牲两头，放帐、觅雇工，自己不劳动，我是地主。”很多人就斥责他说：“你光说是地主还不行，你把你的剥削说说！”还有人说：“你不说，还是不低头！”
    这些都是缺乏民主精神的表现，是容易冤枉人的。一般都认为划阶级就是阶级斗争，这是对的。但在划阶级当中的斗争，应该是按事实、讲道理、拿证据；在划阶级中提高群众的阶级觉悟，也应该是严格按照中央规定的标准来划，不然，反而曾模糊了群众的阶级意识，分不清敌我。一定要按政策、按实际决定成份，而不能只以多数压倒少数的方式决定成份。在讨论阶级时，要按完全民主、毫无强迫的精神，允许任何人自由发表不同意的意见，互相争论和提出证据。有争论不能解决时，就要经过再调查，再开会讨论。我们某些同志，在这问题上又往往会把强迫命令的旧作风和“左”倾情绪结合起来，造成错误。我们不仅在划阶级过程中要十分慎重、严肃并贯彻民主精神，就是三榜定案之后，也应允许不服的人提出他的证据，向上级党政机关提出控告。
    按照中央规定，三榜定案的次序应是：第一榜由贫农团全体会或农会小组会逐户讨论通过；第二榜是由农会全体会逐户讨论通过；第三榜是由村民大会逐一讨论通过。有很多地方不是照这规定办事的，有的只让贫农团通过或只吸收少数中农讨论；沙河规定最后定案是由农代会审查通过。就划阶级这一件事来说，这样是不够充分发扬民主的。
    记者认为：以上这些偏向，都是没有按照党的政策办事；有的是擅自修改或曲解党的政策，有的是糊里糊涂没有好好学习党的政策，都是自由主义的表现。这种不执行党的正确政策而滥用自己的错误政策的自由主义现象，是需要纠正而且必须纠正的。有些地方有些工作组已开始纠正，这是好的。但这还不够；对于违犯了政策的工作人员，应该给以严厉的批评；糊里糊涂办错了事的，以后再不能糊里糊涂了，要好好研究党的政策，好好调查实际情况。瞎碰是危险的，为了保证革命胜利，我们必须十分清醒。
