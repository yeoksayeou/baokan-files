Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 13th: During the Chahar-Suiyuan Railway offensive, the civilian labor teams and militia regiments from the Jizhong Eighth Military Subdistrict worked actively, cared for the wounded, and helped the residents with production. Most of the civilian laborers and militiamen from Jizhong Eighth Military Subdistrict were democratically assessed by the entire village before departure. They were warmly seen off by the villagers, and many pasted their merit plans on their new stretchers. Some of them had never even seen mountains, but due to the development of class consciousness, mutual assistance and love, they overcame all difficulties. The Hejian civilian labor team seized the gaps in the march to carry out a sewing campaign, and eight out of ten people's shoes were resoled. When passing Beizi Ridge, a civilian laborer fell ill and couldn't climb the mountain, so the comrade in charge of the county's armed forces personally carried him up the mountain. The Qingcang County militia and civilian labor team formulated a "Glorious Deeds Record" during the march. Whenever a member did a good deed, it was recorded to encourage mutual encouragement and learning within the team, and as a basis for evaluating merit. The Anguo stretcher team made specific plans for each person. Twenty-five meritorious persons held a unity meeting, proposing to unite with the team members, add merit to merit, and strive for greater victories. Many team members put forward slogans such as: Obey orders, care for the wounded, and the people love the people. During the long march, despite fatigue, they helped 376 households with production in fifteen days. Meritorious worker Wang Wenhuan marched eighty li, didn't sleep all night, and led the team to collect manure for poor military families, and also made a spinning wheel for the women of a mountain village. The Anping civilian labor stretcher team, under the slogan "Everything for serving the wounded," carefully researched and made stretchers with cloth bottoms and legs, so the wounded could lie on them without touching the ground, making them more comfortable. Each stretcher was equipped with quilts, pillows, kettles, and cotton trousers to protect the wounded from the cold, and also a shovel to dig air-raid shelters for the wounded. A squad of the Jianguo County (newly established county, parts of Xianxian and Qingxian) civilian labor stretcher team traveled 20 li in two hours to minimize the suffering of the wounded. Stretcher bearers Zhang Xincheng and others volunteered to go to the supply department to collect bullets and send them to the front line. He carried two boxes himself, and carried two wounded back without rest, then went to carry stretchers. When the Hejian militia launched a general offensive on Yu County, they disregarded enemy artillery fire and volunteered to carry ladders to the foot of the city and erect them. The troops also paid attention to caring for the civilian laborers. The Party Committee of a certain corps issued "Instructions on the Work of Civilian Laborers Accompanying the Army," calling on the entire army to care for them. A certain brigade commander explained current affairs to the civilian laborers, the health team treated the civilian laborers, dispatched barbers to cut their hair, and the troops helped the civilian laborers carry stretchers during the march, and let the civilian laborers receive rice first when camping. When nine members of the Anping stretcher team fell ill, the troops immediately sent 100,000 yuan for condolences. It truly achieved military-civilian unity, as close as brothers.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 11th: Cadres and support staff from more than ten units including the CPC Jin-Sui Sub-Bureau, the Border Region Administrative Office, the Military Region Headquarters, and the Political Department, in response to General He Long's call, once again organized a stretcher team to carry wounded and sick soldiers passing through the area, in order to reduce the burden on the people and fully carry out spring plowing. The stretcher team was organized by each agency according to manpower and animal power, each with a captain, and eight transit stations were set up according to the distance of each agency. In the spring and summer of last year, a similar stretcher team was also organized here, which played a certain role in reducing the burden on the people and transporting the wounded. It was disbanded in the winter when farming was slack.

　　冀中群众支前积极在察南战役中受奖
    【新华社晋察冀十三日电】察南平绥线攻势作战中，随军民工队、民兵团工作积极，爱护伤员，帮助居民生产。冀中八分区出征民工民兵，大半均经全村民主评定。出发时受到全村群众的热烈欢送，在他们崭新的担架上，很多人贴上了自己的立功计划。他们有的人连山都没有见过，但由于阶级自觉性的发扬，互助互爱，克服了一切困难。河间民工队抓紧行军空隙，开展缝补运动，十分之八的人的鞋子，都补了双底。过北子岭时，有一民工生病爬不上山，县武装负责同志亲自背他上山。青沧县民兵队民工队，在行军中制订光荣事迹簿，队员做了一件好事，随时填写，推动了全队互相鼓励与学习，并作为评功的根据。安国担架团，每个人都做了具体计划，二十五名功臣，开了齐心会，提出要和队员们团结，功上加功，争取更大的胜利。许多队员提出：服从指挥，爱护伤员，民爱民等口号。他们在长途行军中，不顾疲劳，在十五天内帮助了三百七十六户群众生产。功臣王文焕行军八十多里，一宿没合眼，就带领队员给贫苦军属起粪一圈，还给一个山庄的妇女做纺车一辆。安平民工担架队，在“一切为了给伤员服务”的口号下，经过细心研究，他们的担架都是布底装了架腿，伤员躺在上面身子不挨地，比较舒适。每付担架都附有给伤员用的被子、枕头、水壶及为伤员防止寒冷的棉裤等，还准备下一把铁锹，好为伤员挖防空洞。建国县（新设县，献县、青县各一部）民工担架队一个班，为使伤员少受痛苦，两小时走廿里。担架队员张信成等，并自动到供给处领子弹送到火线，他自己背了两箱，回来时还背下两个伤员，没有休息，就去抬担架。河间民兵，在总攻蔚县时，不顾敌人炮火射击自报奋勇，把梯子扛到城下竖立起来。部队对民工也注意爱护，某兵团党委会颁发“随军民工工作指示”，号召全军爱护他们。某旅长给民工讲解时事，卫生队给民工治病，派理发员给民工理发，行军中部队帮助民工抬担架，宿营时先让民工领米。安平担架团病了九个队员，部队立即送去十万元慰问。真正做到了军民团结，亲如兄弟。
    【新华社晋绥十一日电】此间中共晋绥分局、边区行署、军区司令部、政治部等十余单位干部及勤杂人员，响应贺龙将军号召，再度组织担架队，抬送过境伤病员，以减轻民负，全力进行春耕。担架队由各机关根据人力畜力分别组织，各设队长，并按各机关远近分设八个转运站。按去年春夏，此间亦组织相同的担架队，在减轻民负，转运伤员上起了一定作用，冬季农闲始行解散。
