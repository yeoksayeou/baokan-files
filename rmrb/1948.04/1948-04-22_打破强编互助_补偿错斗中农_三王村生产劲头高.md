　　Breaking Forced Mutual Aid, Compensating Wrongly Struggled Middle Peasants
  　Sanwang Village's Production Enthusiasm is High
    [Our News] Sanwang Village used to be a production model village in the ninth district, and had won three award banners from the district office. When the land reform and party rectification were about to end, the leadership focused on education regarding mutual aid production, and after the conclusion, began to rectify mutual aid. First, the poor peasant and farm laborer groups, and the members of the farmers' association, reviewed the past problems with mutual aid and decided how to conduct mutual aid in the future. Then, the farmers' association groups conducted reviews, revealing the following shortcomings of past mutual aid: 1. The mutual aid groups were formed by forced means, and members were not free; they had to go wherever the group leader told them to go. 2. People couldn't overcome sentimentality; those with half labor power and those with full labor power exchanged labor, and hardworking families suffered losses for several years, but couldn't voice their dissatisfaction. If they did, they were afraid of being called selfish. 3. Forced commands; those who didn't participate in mutual aid were punished. For example, three families in the fifth group were fined seven packs of Rendan cough medicine, and Erlaixi and others were fined 500 yuan. 4. The groups were too large, with twenty to fifty households. For example, in the seventh group, more than thirty people went to the field, and it took from early morning to mid-morning to gather everyone before going to the field. It looked spectacular on the surface, but actually wasted labor. When reporting, they had to say that they had saved five or six laborers, otherwise they were afraid of being called backward and punished. 5. With so many people, there were also many wasted workdays when settling accounts. For example, when the seventh group finished hoeing the first seedlings and settled accounts, more than thirty people spent two days at home calculating, wasting sixty or seventy workdays. 6. Restrictions on switching groups, restrictions on going to other villages to do short-term labor, and regulations that priority should be given to the families of resistance fighters, then to the orphaned and widowed, and finally to themselves. The same applied to livestock. 7. When launching competitions, the amount of labor, livestock, and land of each group were not taken into account; they had to complete the task on the day specified. Therefore, the more model groups Sanwang Village had, the worse the land was cultivated, and the less labor was saved. On the contrary, the backward groups cultivated the land better. In the past few years of mutual aid, the leadership focused on it closely, so mutual aid was carried out; otherwise, it slowly fell apart. After three nights of heated review and debate, the poor peasant and farm laborer groups and the members resolved to overcome the past shortcomings and to form truly free groups. Many groups have now been formed. The Farmers' Association Committee also discussed strengthening production leadership and changing the organizational structure, expanding the production department of the Farmers' Association Committee and establishing five groups under the production department. The groups are now actively organizing. In addition, the mutual aid guidance group has also resolved the production difficulties of wrongly struggled households, with nineteen households receiving one hoe each, and eight households sharing two donkeys and two cows, with each animal also receiving 300 jin of grass. The production enthusiasm of the masses is unprecedentedly high. (Lu Geng)

　　打破强编互助  补偿错斗中农
  　三王村生产劲头高
    【本报消息】三王村过去是九区的生产模范村，曾得过区署奖旗三面。当填补整党将要结束时，领导上抓紧互助生产的教育，结束后即开始整顿互助。先由贫雇小组、农会委员检讨过去互助的毛病，决定今后如何互助，然后农会小组进行检讨，检讨出过去互助有如下缺点：一、起根结组就是编起来的，组员身不由己，组长叫去哪就去哪。二、打不破情面，半劳力和整劳力互助起来工换工，好受家吃了几年亏，嘴里说不出，心里不满意。说了怕人说自私自利。三、强迫命令，不互助就受处分。如五组三家罚了七包仁丹，二来喜等罚了五百元。四、组太大，有二十户至五十户的，如七组，三十余人去地，从清早起集中人到半前晌才上地。表面轰烈，实际误工，汇报时，还得说省工五六个，否则怕说落后，又怕受罚。五、人多算帐时误工也多，如七组锄完第一遍苗结帐时，三十多人在家算了两天误了六七十个工。六、限制跳组，限制出村打短工，规定先给抗属种，再给孤寡种，最后才轮到自己，牲口也是如此。七、发动竞赛时，不按各组劳力、畜力、土地多少，限定哪天完成就哪天完成。因此，三王村越是模范组，地越种得不好，越不省工。相反的，落后组地还种得好些。几年来的互助，领导上抓得紧，就互助起来，否则就慢散开了。经过三夜热烈的检讨和争论，贫雇小组和委员下了决心，要克服过去的缺点，要真正自由结组，现已结好不少组。农会委员会也讨论了要加强生产领导，组织机构上也要变动，扩大农委会中的生产部，在生产部下设五个组，现各组正在积极进行组织中。另外在互助指导组中，并解决了错斗户的生产困难，有十九户，每户分一张锄，有八户共分两头驴、两头牛，每头牲口还给草三百斤。群众生产情绪空前高涨。（陆耕）
