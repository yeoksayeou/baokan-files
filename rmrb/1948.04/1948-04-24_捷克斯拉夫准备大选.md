　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Prague dispatch: The Czech general election, originally scheduled for May 23rd, has been postponed to May 30th due to a scheduling conflict with the agricultural exhibition. On the 13th, the Czech government passed a new election bill proposed by the Ministry of Interior, stipulating that all citizens, except for traitors who collaborated with the German aggressors, can participate in direct, universal, and secret voting, and stipulating that several parties can submit joint candidate lists. The bill will become law after it is passed by the parliament. The Central Council of the Czechoslovak Trade Union has recently suggested to the political parties of the National Front to submit a unified list of candidates in the election and jointly celebrate "May Day." This suggestion has been successively approved by the working people, the Czech Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and various social groups and political organizations. The Central Committee of the National Front has decided to adopt this suggestion.

　　捷克斯拉夫准备大选
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】布拉格讯：原定于五月二十三日举行的捷克大选，因与农业展览会时间冲突，已改期于五月三十日举行。十三日，捷政府通过内政部提出的新选举法案，规定除曾与德国侵略者合作的卖国分子外，一切公民均可参加直接、普遍、无记名投票，并规定若干政党可提出联合候选名单。该案经议会通过后即可成为法律。捷职工会中央全会日前已向民族阵线各政党建议在选举中提出统一的候选名单，并联合庆祝“五一”节。这一建议已先后获得劳动人民、捷共、社会民主党以及各社团政团的赞成。民族阵线中央委员会决定采纳这一建议。
