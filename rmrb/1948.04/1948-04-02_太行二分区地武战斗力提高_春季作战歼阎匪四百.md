　　Taixing Second Military Sub-district Local Armed Forces Improve Combat Effectiveness;
  　Spring Campaign Annihilates 400 Yan Bandits
[Report from this newspaper in Taixing] In the spring campaign, the 43rd unit of the Taixing Second Military Sub-district achieved successive victories, eliminating more than 420 Yan bandits, greatly exceeding the planned number of enemy annihilated. After reorganization and training, the soldiers of this unit generally had a surge in enthusiasm to kill the enemy. Before the battle, they had democratic discussions to devise methods, and they were brave and resolute in executing orders during the battle. On February 4th, in the ambush battles of Sigu and Xinzhuang, after eliminating more than 140 Yan bandit Eighth Detachment soldiers, on the night of March 18th, in order to cooperate with the main force in the southern line, they also used mobile flanking tactics to annihilate 170 enemy soldiers, who were more than twice their strength. This kind of proactive operation with fewer troops defeating more fully demonstrated the great improvement in the tactics and political qualities of our local armed forces. In total, in recent operations, the unit eliminated 421 enemy soldiers, including 101 enemy platoon and company leaders and below captured alive, and 320 enemy soldiers, including three company leaders and below, killed or wounded. They seized two mortars, two heavy machine guns, two heavy machine gun mounts, eight light machine guns, three small cannons, 76 rifles, one pistol, 5,200 rounds of ammunition, 87 large and small shells, six mules, and a portion of other military supplies. In addition, they destroyed 37 sections of railway track and blew up one bridge.
[Report from this newspaper in Taixing] Our Jinzhong anti-grain grabbing and conscription protection campaign has been victorious. After our Second Military Sub-district troops annihilated more than 140 enemies in Taigu on the 19th, on the night of the 21st, our Yuci regiment learned that the Yan bandit police 7th regiment stationed in Xiuwen, Yuci, was going to Yangliang Village south of the city to grab grain. Our troops immediately combined with the militia to ambush inside Yangliang Village before dawn. On the morning of the 22nd, the enemy's 7th and 9th companies, with more than 200 soldiers, came to Yangliang Village to grab grain. As soon as the enemy entered the village, we launched a charge, bravely attacking the enemy. The enemy was caught unprepared and in chaos, losing combat effectiveness and fleeing in panic. In half an hour of battle, more than ten enemies were killed or wounded, and 56 enemies, including Gao Jinshan, the 7th company commander, and Chen Shuhua, the 9th company commander, were captured alive. They seized four machine guns, six small cannons, more than 980 rounds of ammunition, 22 small shells, two pairs of binoculars, and a portion of other military supplies.
