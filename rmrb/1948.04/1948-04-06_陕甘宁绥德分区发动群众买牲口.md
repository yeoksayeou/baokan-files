Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd. Due to two instances of plunder by the Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandits last year, the Suide Partition of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia suffered heavy losses of draught animals. Currently, out of the partition's 1.8 million hectares of cultivated land, aside from fully utilizing the surviving animal power and manpower, 245,000 hectares cannot be cultivated due to a lack of draught animals. To address this, the partition decided at the county magistrate conference in the latter half of last month to purchase 5,000 head of draught animals throughout the partition, with 4,200 head to be purchased by mobilizing the masses and 800 head to be purchased with government loans. The Border Region Government has already allocated a large quantity of grain as loans to farmers in various counties, estimated to be sufficient to purchase 5,000 head of draught animals, which can cultivate 220,000 hectares of land. The remaining 20,000 hectares of land can be cultivated by mobilizing women and children. According to the Secretary of the Yihe District Committee in Suide, the district originally planned to buy 120 head of livestock, but the masses have already bought back more than 150 head. It is estimated that the county's plan to buy 1,000 head will not be difficult to achieve.

　　陕甘宁绥德分区
  　发动群众买牲口
    【新华社西北二日电】陕甘宁绥德分区，由于去年遭蒋胡匪两次掠夺，耕畜损失甚多，现全分区一百八十万垧耕地中，除充分发挥幸存畜力及人力外，尚有二十四万五千垧因缺乏耕畜无法耕种。为此，该分区在上月下旬县长会议上决定全分区购进耕畜五千头，其中发动群众购买四千二百头，政府贷款购买八百头。现边府已拨大批粮食分贷各县农民，估计足购五千头耕畜，可耕地二十二万垧，其余耕地两万垧，可发动妇女儿童耕作。据绥德义合区委书记谈：该区原计划买牲口百二十头，现在群众已买回百五十多头，估计全县买一千头的计划当不难实现。
