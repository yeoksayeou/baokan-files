Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Reports from various sources: The movement of people from various countries to aid democratic Greece is underway. Despite the shameless obstruction of the reactionary authorities of the United States, Britain, and France, the International Conference for Aiding Democratic Greece, hosted by the French Committee for Aiding Democratic Greece, opened on the 10th at the Trade Union Building in Paris. Attendees included representatives from France, Britain, the United States, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain, Poland, Albania, Austria, Algeria, Vietnam, Canada, and other countries. The chairman of the first conference was the famous French poet Paul Éluard. In his opening speech, he praised the Greek people's great contribution to the struggle for human rights and national independence, and read letters and telegrams from democratic organizations in the United States, Britain, and other countries, all expressing their determination to unite with the fighting Greek people. The South Aid Greek People's Committee sent a telegram to the conference, protesting the French authorities' refusal to allow the South delegation to enter the country to attend the meeting, and expressed support for the Greek people's demands against US and British intervention. US Labor Party MP Isaacson was also unable to attend due to the State Department's refusal to issue a passport. On the 3rd, the Czech-Democratic Greece Friendship Association held a mass rally in Prague, passing a resolution condemning US and British interference in Greece's internal affairs, and expressing angry protest against the inhuman treatment of democratic elements by the royalist fascists. At the end of last month, at the annual meeting of the British Blackpool Delivery Workers' Union, the majority of representatives called for the withdrawal of British troops and foreign military missions stationed in Greece and the release of arrested trade union activists.
