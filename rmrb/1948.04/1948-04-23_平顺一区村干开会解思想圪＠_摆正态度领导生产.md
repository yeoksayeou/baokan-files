Ping Shun News: The First District convened a joint meeting of cadres and poor peasant/hired laborers from thirty villages on the 11th. The meeting lasted for three days, with over one hundred and twenty people in attendance. The purpose of the meeting was to resolve confused thinking and boldly lead production. The main issues discussed at the meeting are reported as follows:

(1) Passive Waiting and Doing Nothing. After the Land Law Outline was disseminated to the villages, the peasant masses supported it. However, due to a lack of understanding of the situation, they engaged in wild speculation. Some said that the cadres would be made to reflect on their actions. Most village cadres were also confused and vaguely accepted the term "poor peasant/hired laborer in charge." Coupled with rumors and the fact that cadres themselves had made mistakes in the past, they began to do nothing, passively waiting to be removed from their positions. Wang Long, the village chief of Chengguan Village, said: “At the beginning of the distribution, I was always hesitant, unsure whether to act or not. I thought it would be better to be an ordinary person like the poor peasants/hired laborers. When I speak, people don't listen. When I ask them what opinions they have about me, they say, 'Can't you criticize yourself?'" Therefore, they dared not lead the work and dared not use any methods they had. Yang Changshui said: "The cadres have no future." The village chief of Zhangjing Village said: "Perhaps we shouldn't have advanced so quickly (meaning they shouldn't have become cadres)." The general sentiment was to do less and make fewer mistakes.

(2) Ideological Resistance and Cynical Remarks. After the leadership proposed to change the past administrative order style and establish a democratic style, the village cadres resisted ideologically. They used superficial democratic methods to carry out their work but did not actually lead. Instead, they stood aside and made cynical remarks. Some even specialized in finding faults in the village to use as a shield against the anti-democratic style, showing the leadership that such democracy made it impossible to work. However, they ignored whether the masses felt this way. A poor peasant/hired laborer from Zhangjing Village said on the spot: "The masses are easy to lead; it's just that the cadres don't do anything."

(3) Past Mistakes and Blaming District Cadres. When inspecting the past administrative order style, the cadres were emotionally resentful, regretting becoming cadres and feeling that their efforts were not appreciated. They described it as "giving birth to a baby." Even if the past administrative order was wrong, the work still had some achievements. Furthermore, they argued that village cadres were led by county and district cadres, so why was it all the fault of the village cadres when mistakes were made in the past? Due to this emotional resistance, the self-criticism could not be deepened. Huang Lianzhu, the village chief of Beitou Village, said: "In the past, some households that should have been struggled against were not, and some that should not have been were. You can't completely blame the village cadres, as the county and district cadres were watching." Guo Changsheng, the political director of Zhongwujing Village, said: "Struggling against the big ones leaves behind the small ones, and there's always a big one among the small ones. When inspecting, isn't it still blaming the village cadres? It's as if the county and district cadres weren't watching." Others said: "Yes, the village cadres' administrative order style was wrong in the past, but which task wasn't assigned by the district? We took a copy from the district and then assigned it to the masses in the village. You say these styles are all our fault, but the district cadres weren't around."

(4) Distinguishing Public and Private Affairs, Individual Responsibility. Due to the ideological confusion, village cadres could not calmly examine the past. Consequently, Comrade Wang Xinke, the Party branch secretary of Wangzhuang Village, talked about his feelings and ideological struggle during the Party rectification. He said that at the beginning of the self-criticism, his thinking was also very confused, and he even thought of dying. Later, he realized that the Party rectification was to improve the work, not for the masses to deliberately make things difficult for him, but because he had done some things that were unfair to the masses. After his speech, the leadership proposed distinguishing public and private affairs and individual responsibility, with the leadership making self-criticisms for the leadership's mistakes and the village cadres making self-criticisms for their mistakes. For example, some people shielded landlords, stole public grain, used torture, beat people, and engaged in corruption during the self-criticism. These were not tasks assigned to the cadres by the leadership. However, the cadres had committed such mistakes. Who should criticize these, and who should criticize those who are lying down and doing nothing? Furthermore, the leadership had indeed made mistakes in the past, and these were self-criticized at the Party rectification meeting and will continue to be self-criticized in the actual work. After this explanation, the village cadres calmly began to think about their own problems. Wang Xiaotu, the political director of Beitou Village, said: "Yes, can you say that all the bad things we did in the village were ordered by the higher-ups?" Huang Lianzhu said: "If this meeting had been held earlier, we could have understood this matter clearly, and we would have felt more comfortable."

(5) Relying on Poor Peasants/Hired Laborers and Uniting with Middle Peasants. After the cadres' emotions changed, they all examined their own style of work and felt that all work must rely on poor peasants/hired laborers and unite with middle peasants, otherwise the work could not be carried out, and the style of work could not be changed. For example, Liu Baohai, a poor peasant/hired laborer from Xiaowen Village, said: "Cadres should criticize whether the opinions of the masses are incorrect, or whether they themselves have problems. Who wouldn't be satisfied with production, but if you act tough and intimidate people, that won't work. For example, in distributing fruit, if the cadres are fair, the masses won't complain. But if the cadres steal fruit, can you blame the higher-ups or the masses? If the cadres lead well in production, even if there were mistakes in the past, the masses will forgive you." From these voices of the poor peasants/hired laborers, the village cadres clearly felt that the poor peasants/hired laborers were willing to be led by them, and it was indeed wrong for them not to do anything.

(6) Kicking Away the Old Foundation Was Wrong. After the cadres' emotions changed, they all discussed how to proceed. The district cadres also self-criticized their leadership of production during this period. The main defect was that they kicked away the old foundation, and did not even hold a Party branch meeting. As a result, the Party members did not understand what was going on, and there was no contact with them, which also affected their ideological fluctuations. All comrades, whether they participated in the study or not, were completely abandoned or ignored, and no active efforts were made to understand the branch. Because many Party members in the branch still had prestige among the masses and could still lead production. Therefore, it was wrong to completely abandon and ignore them. This will be corrected upon returning.

　　平顺一区村干开会解思想圪＠
  　摆正态度领导生产
    【平顺消息】一区于十一号召开了三十个村的干部与贫雇联席会议，会期三天，到会一百二十余人，会议目的在于解决混乱思想，大胆领导生产。兹将会议中几个主要问题报导如下：
    （一）消极等待躺倒不干。土地法大纲传到各村后，农民群众是拥护的。但由于摸不清底，就乱猜摸。有的说还有这一天，可该叫干部反省反省啦。一般村干部也是摸不着头脑，模糊接受了“贫雇当家”字眼，再加上风言风语，在干部本身过去也确有毛病，于是就躺倒不干啦，消极的等待下台。又城关村长王龙说：平分开始总是疑疑惑惑的，干也不是，不干也不是，想还不如当个老百姓和贫雇。说话吧人家也不理，咱问问人家对咱有甚意见，人家说你不会检讨？因此对工作不敢领导，有办法也不敢使出来。杨长水说：干部没下场。张井村长说：可不该跑的太快啦（意即不该进步当干部），一般的论调都是少干点少出错。
    （二）思想抵抗，说风凉话。在领导上提出要转变过去的行政命令作风，树立民主作风之后，村干部在思想上是抵抗的，用表面的民主方式去进行工作，实际上不去领导，自己站在一边，说风凉话。还有的是专找村里的邪气，来作反民主作风的挡箭牌，叫领导上看，意思就是说，你们看这都是上级叫民主哩，这样民主的还能干？不看群众是不是这样。张井贫雇在当场就说：群众是好领导的，就是干部不干。
    （三）过去有错，埋怨区干部们在开始检查过去行政命令作风时，干部在情绪上是怨天尤人，后悔不该当了干部，出力没有叫好。说这叫大闺女生孩子。就算是过去行政命令不对，可是工作总是有成绩。其次说村干部不是县、区干部领导吗？过去弄错了，全都是村干部的不对？由于这种情绪的对抗，在检查上就深入不下去。北头村村长黄连柱说：过去村上有些户该斗的未斗，不该斗的斗啦，也不能完全怨村干部，不是县、区干部在那里看着哩。中五井政治主任郭长生说：斗了大的丢下小的，小的里也总有个大的，一检查起来还不是怨村干部？就象县、区干部没有在那里看着似的。还有的说：是啊，过去村干部行政命令作风不对，可是哪一件工作不是区上分配下去。咱在区上领上一份，到了村上再派给群众，你说这些作风都是怨咱，区干部就不在跟前哩。
    （四）公私分开个人负责。由于思想的混乱，使得村干不能平心静气的去检查过去，随即由王庄支书王新科同志，谈他在整党中感觉和思想斗争，他说开始反省，他思想上也很混乱，甚至想到死。以后又想到整党是为了把工作弄好，不是群众故意给自己过不去，是自己有些事情对不起群众。经他谈后，领导上又提出公私分开，个人负责，领导上的错误领导上作检讨，村干部的错误村干部作检讨。如大家在反省中有的包庇地主，偷吃公粮义粮，吊人、打人、腐化等，这都不是领导上给干部布置的。但是干部们都犯了这种错误，你说这应该是谁检讨呢？躺倒不干应该谁检讨呢？其次在领导上过去也确有毛病，这些在整党会议上都作了检讨，并且在实际工作中还继续作检讨。经过这样说明后，村干部都在心平气和的想自己问题了。如北头政治主任王小秃说：就是呀，你说咱在村上作了好多坏事，都是上级叫咱干哩？黄连柱说：要是早开这个会，能把这事弄明白，心里也舒坦了。
    （五）依靠贫雇团结中农。村干的情绪转过后，都在检查自己的作风，感到一切工作必须是依靠贫雇团结中农，不然工作就无法进行，作风也无从转变。如孝文贫雇刘保孩说：干部们应该检讨是群众提意见不对，还是自己有毛病呢？你说搞生产谁能不满意，可是你要耍态度吓唬人那就不行了。比如分果实，干部分公平了，群众就不会反映，可是干部要偷果实，你说是怨上级怨群众？干部好好领导搞生产，就算过去有错误，群众也会原谅你。从这些贫雇的呼声中很明显的使村干部们感到贫雇对自己是愿意叫领导的，自己不干确实不对。
    （六）一脚踢开老基础不对。干部情绪转过后，都纷纷讨论下去如何作。区干部对这段的生产领导，也作了检查。主要一个缺陷是把老基础一脚踢开了，根本就未去开支部会。因此使党员摸不清这是怎么一回事，也不和他们接个头，这样也影响他们思想上的波动。对老基础无论参加学习或未参加学习的同志，都一律丢掉或不管，而没有积极的去进行了解支部。因为很多支部中大多数党员在群众中还是有威信的，还是能领导生产的。因此完全丢掉放弃不管是不对的，此次回去要纠正。
