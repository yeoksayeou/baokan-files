　　Discovering and Correcting Deviations Promptly
  　Neiqiu Provides Specific Leadership for Production
    [Neiqiu News] On April 1st, the county convened a meeting of key leading cadres from the districts to review the production work of the past twenty-odd days and to make arrangements for production and disaster relief. After the meeting, responsible comrades from the County Production Committee went to each district to conduct inspections and discovered several deviations in the implementation of tasks in each district: (1) Distribution was averaged without regard to actual conditions, without good understanding and specific research beforehand, resulting in sloppy distribution. In the First District, when announcing the distribution figures for loan funds at a village cadre meeting, the villages of Dongjie, Zhizhai Village, and Lijia'ao immediately stated that their villages did not need relief, and Northwest Ridge suggested that Zicaigou and Mazhuang, which had suffered severe disasters, were allocated too little. However, the district leaders ignored these opinions, assuming that a decision had already been made, and distributed the funds as originally planned. For example, in Beizhang Town, there were only ten disaster victims, and the village still had a portion of fruit grain and over 300,000 yuan in fruit funds, which was sufficient to solve the difficulties of the disaster victims without further relief. However, the district cadres did not conduct specific investigations and statistics in the village, but allocated 1,000 jin of relief grain and 250,000 yuan in loans. (2) A purely task-oriented, bureaucratic style of work, lending for the sake of lending, distributing to complete the task, and a careless class viewpoint. For example, the Second District did not base its distribution on investigations and actual disaster conditions, but rather asked the villages for loan applicants, accepting whatever the villages reported without scrutiny. For example, in Feng Village, out of a total of 100 households, 70 households applied for loans, averaging 10,000 yuan per household, for a total of 700,000 yuan. In ××× Village (village name not recorded) in the Fifth District, out of a total of 80 households, 90 households were reported. The district was also completely irresponsible and distributed items without examination. (3) The selection of relief committee members was inappropriate, and good deeds were turned bad. In Guanzhuang Village in the Sixth District, Zhao Rong, the head of the cooperative, had a good time during the land reform last year, indulging in lavish eating and drinking, and even taking large bottles of wine with him when transporting public grain. Such a person was appointed as a relief committee member and borrowed grain without limit. These deviations are completely inconsistent with the basic principles of production for disaster relief, focusing on disaster areas and targeting disaster victims, as set by the county. In terms of overall production leadership, the county's arrangements were mechanically applied, without formulating specific plans and work steps in conjunction with the actual conditions of the districts and villages. For example, when deploying work at a village cadre meeting in the First District, a portion of the county's original arrangements was extracted and read word for word to the village cadres without any explanation, leading to many misunderstandings. For example, the establishment of a production committee was rigidly read as "organizing production institutions," which the village cadres misheard as calling for the production of "chickens and dogs." On the other hand, there was a lack of work initiative and failure to propose new plans in a timely manner based on changes in actual conditions. For example, the recent spring rain provided favorable conditions for planting cotton, sesame, and sorghum, but the districts did not issue new calls to action to organize and mobilize the masses to plant.
    In order to promptly correct these deviations, the County Production Committee held an emergency meeting on the evening of the 11th to study and correct these deviations, and also issued an emergency instruction letter and went down to conduct inspections, understand the situation, and provide specific leadership.

    Editor's Note: For the leadership of the current spring plowing and production to overcome famine, arrangements, plans, and calls to action are all necessary, but that alone is not enough. Leaders must conduct timely and in-depth inspections and provide specific leadership after making arrangements and issuing calls to action. Deviations must be corrected immediately when discovered, and new problems must be solved in a timely manner, so that the production movement can be quickly launched. Neiqiu paid attention to checking and correcting deviations in a timely manner after arranging production and relief. Although this is only the beginning, this leadership method is worthy of emulation by other regions. We must pay attention to changing the bureaucratic leadership method of simply making arrangements and then being done with it in order to promote the current production movement.

　　发现偏向及时纠正
  　内邱具体领导生产
    【内邱消息】四月一日县召开了区主要领导干部会议，检查了二十余天的生产工作，并作了生产救灾工作布置。会议结束后，县生产委员会负责同志，即分赴各区进行检查，发现各区在执行任务中，发生了几个偏向：（一）不根据实际情况平均分配，事先没有进行很好的了解和具体研究，马虎分配。一区在村干部大会上宣布分配贷粮款数字时，有东街、智翟庄、李家凹三个村，当场提出他们村不需要救济，西北岭提出紫草沟、马庄灾荒大分配数少，但区领导上对这意见没理，以为已经决议了，就原样不变的分下去了。另如北障镇只有十个灾民，村里还存着果实粮一部、果实款三十余万元，是足能解决灾民困难的，不需再救济，区干部根本没到村进行具体调查统计，却给分配了一千斤救济贷粮米，二十五万贷款。（二）单纯的任务观点，官僚主义作风，为了贷款贷粮而贷，为交差而分配，阶级观点马虎。如二区不是通过调查，根据实际灾情来分配，而是向村要贷户，村里报多少算多少，也不加审查。如冯村全村共一百户，即有七十户贷款，每户平均一万元，贷了七十万元。五区×××村（不记村名了）全村八十户，即报了九十户。区也根本不负责任，不经审查的分给了东西。（三）救济委员选的不妥当，好事也办坏了。六区官庄村合作社长赵荣，去年翻身翻的很展，大吃大喝，出外运送公粮还要带着大瓶酒喝。这样的人担任了救济委员，在借粮中不限数目的乱借。以上这几种偏向，是完全与县布置的救灾工作目的是生产，重点是灾区，对象是灾民的基本原则不相符合。在整个生产领导方面，机械搬用县里布置，不是结合区村实际情况，订出具体计划与工作步骤。如一区在村干部会议上，布置工作时，摘了县原布置的一部分，一字一句毫不加解释的念给村干部，村干部听不懂发生了许多误会。如把建立生产委员会死板的念成“组织生产机构”，村干部听差了，听成了叫生产“鸡狗”。另方面缺乏工作主动性，不能根据实际情况的变化需要，适时的提出新计划。如最近下了场春雨，给了种花、芝麻、高粱的有利条件，但各区并没有提出新的号召，组织发动群众下种。
    县生产委员会为了及时的纠正偏向，特于十一日晚召开了紧急会议，研究纠正这些偏向，并又发出紧急指示信，又分头下去进行检查，了解情况，具体领导。（内邱县联合办公室）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：对于当前春耕生产渡荒工作的领导，布置、计划、号召，都是必要的，但光那样是不行的，领导者必须在布置号召之后，有及时深入的检查与具体的领导。发现偏向立即纠正，有新问题及时解决，这样才能使生产运动很快开展起来。内邱在布置了生产救济之后，注意检查及时纠正偏向，虽然还只是开始这样作，但这种领导方法是值得各地效法的。必须注意改变布置下去就完事的官僚主义的领导方法，才能推动当前的生产运动。
