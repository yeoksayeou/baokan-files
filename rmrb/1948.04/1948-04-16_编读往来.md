　　How to Distribute Land When Settling in Two Places?
　　Editor:
　　Ji Guichun from Nanwutan Village, Longping County, is a working cadre. His family consists of four people (including himself). Ji Guichun got married in Zanhuang County, and his wife is from Chengnan Street. When settling down, Ji Guichun settled his wife in Chengnan Street, Zanhuang, after going through procedures in Longping County (without going through the prefectural commissioner's office and Zanhuang County). His wife requested the street leader in Chengnan Street, Zanhuang, to treat her as a military family member and give her a share of land and property during the fair distribution. The street leader disagreed.
　　Is this considered settling down in two places, with four people in total, three in Nanwutan Village, Longping, and one in Chengnan Street, Zanhuang County?
　　　　　　　　
　　Zanhuang County Civil Affairs Section Xiu Zeng
Xiu Zeng, Zanhuang County Civil Affairs Section: Regarding Ji Guichun from Longping you mentioned, as long as his wife doesn't occupy two shares of land, it is, in principle, permissible for her to receive land distribution in Chengnan Street, Zanhuang. However, besides completing the procedures in Longping County, Zanhuang County's approval should also be obtained. This is because married women usually receive land distribution in their husband's home. If his family of four still receives the land and property of four people, just divided between two places, it is naturally not considered as taking more than one’s share. Settling in two places is permissible, but one person can only have one share; if they receive it there, they cannot receive it here.

　　Soldiers Without Family Members Should Not Have Their Land Confiscated
　　Editor:
　　My family lives in Changzhi city and has always been poor. In 1940, I sent my teenage second child, Hong En, to Nantian Palace Village, Fifth District, Lucheng, to work as a farmhand. During the past mass movement, he was allocated some land and housing. Hong En joined the army last winter, and the village cadres took away his gains. My wife went to inquire, but the village's political director said: "Can people from Changzhi cultivate land in Lucheng? Hong En has left, so who will cultivate the land! Quickly vacate the house." (Because Hong En locked the door when he left and took the key to Changzhi.) In my opinion, even if a soldier has no family members and cannot be allocated land, it should only be implemented during the fair distribution of land. Why did the village confiscate Hong En's land before carrying out the fair distribution? Changzhi's residential staff don't care, and neither does Nantian Palace. What should I do?
        　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Changzhi City Wu Fulin
Comrade Wu Fulin: It is wrong for Nantian Palace Village to confiscate Hong En's land and housing. When the village fills in the gaps in the future, according to Article 10(c) of the Land Law: "All personnel of the People's Liberation Army, democratic governments, and people's organizations who reside in rural areas shall, together with their families, be allocated the same land as the peasants." Your son has joined the army, and regardless of whether he has family members, he should receive the same share as the farmers in the village. After he is allocated land and property in the place where he worked as a farmhand, he cannot be allocated land at your home. Double portions are not allowed. At the same time, if he is allocated land at the place where he worked as a farmhand, he must also bear a share of the corvee labor there. You can consider whether you want to allocate land at home; in that case, the land there can be returned to the farmers' association for disposal. If you want to allocate land in that village, you can discuss it with the village and get the land and property back, to be managed by your family or the village farmers' association on behalf of your son. If a direct resolution is not possible, you can ask the higher-level leadership to handle it.

　　If There Is No One at Home, Can Land Still Be Allocated at Home If Married Elsewhere?
　　Editor:
　　I have two questions to ask!
　　1. A cadre comrade had a business investment of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan and subsidized his wife to study at a certain middle school. His wife is a publicly funded student. However, this time, during the cleanup of organ property, his individual production was stopped, and he immediately felt helpless. So, he said: "Now we must respect women. I will give my share to her so that she can seek her economic independence, and don't bother me again in the future. I am a cadre and cannot invest, but she is a student and of course can." So he transferred the capital to his wife for investment. Some people say this is speculation, while others say it is legitimate and not wrong, but the issue has not been clarified.
　　2. Another cadre has been working for more than ten years. His family was poor and hired, and his family members were persecuted to death by the enemy and landlords, and his family property was gone. He is now married elsewhere, and he cannot maintain his family. He wants to insist on getting a share in his village, but he doesn't know if that is right. Should his village still count him as a member of the village?
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Li Huadang)
Comrade Li Huadang: The answers to your two questions are as follows:
　　1. All private savings should be handled according to Item 4 of the Central Bureau's decision on cleaning up organ production: "In order to promote thrift and encourage savings, and prevent the malpractices of individual production, the funds withdrawn by individuals can be saved in the Jinnan Bank or invested in stores set up by the industrial and commercial trade departments." It is wrong for the comrade you mentioned to change his business investment to his wife's name to solve the difficulty of his wife's schooling. Because according to the regulations, if the money is deposited in the bank or the designated cooperative store, there will also be dividends, and his wife's difficulties can also be solved. There is no need to do that.
　　2. In the case of such cadres, he and his wife can of course receive a share in his own village. Article 10(c) of the Land Law Outline stipulates: "All personnel of the People's Liberation Army, democratic governments, and people's organizations who reside in rural areas shall, together with their families, be allocated the same land and property as the peasants." Even if there is no one at home, the village should still count him as a member.

　　编读往来
    两边安家如何分地编辑同志：
    隆平县南吴滩村人籍贵春，是个工作干部，他全家四口人（本人在内）。籍贵春在赞皇县结婚，女方是城南街人，安家时，籍贵春把妻安到赞皇城南街，经过降平县手续（未经专署和赞皇县手续），其妻在赞皇南街要求街长按军人家属优待，在平分时同样分一份土地财产，街长不同意。
    这样四口人分两处安家，隆平南吴滩村三口人，赞皇县南街一口人，是否叫两头安家？　　　　　　　　
　　赞皇县民政科修增赞皇民政科修增同志：你所说的隆平籍贵春，他妻子愿在赞皇南街分地，只要不两头占双分，原则上是可以的，不过除了隆平县的手续外，应再取得赞皇县的同意。因一般已婚妇女，多是在丈夫家里分地。若他家四口人还是分的四口人的土地财产，只是在两个地方分，自然不算多占果实。两头安家是可以的，但一人只能一份，那边分了这边就不能分。
             　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    没有家属之军人也不愿该没收他的土地编辑同志：
    我家住长治城内，向来家寒，民国二十九年，就把十几岁的二孩子洪恩，送到潞城五区南天宫村，给人当长工种地，过去群运中，他分了些土地房产。洪恩去年冬天参军走了，该村干部就把他的果实夺了。我的老婆去探问究竟，谁知那村政治主任说：你们长治人能在潞城种地吗？洪恩又走啦，谁种地哩！赶快把房子誊清交出来。（因为洪恩走时把门子锁住，把钥匙放在长治了。）我的意见即使军人无家属，不能分土地，也得在平分土地时才能执行，为何该村还没办理平分土地，就先把洪恩的土地没收了？这事长治住村不管，南天宫亦不管，该怎样呢？
        　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　长治市武福林武福林同志：南天宫村没收洪恩的土地房屋是不对的。将来该村填补时，按土地法第十条丙项规定：家居乡村的一切人民解放军、民主政府及人民团体的人员，其本人及其家庭，分给与农民同样的土地。你的儿子参军走了，不管他有无家属他本人应和该村农民一样分得同样一份。在他住长工的地方分了土地财产后，在你家就不能再分。不能分双份。同时若在住长工的地方分了地，支差负担也得在那里顶一份。你们可以考虑，若愿在家分地，那边的地可退给农会处理，若愿意在那村分地，则可以和那村商量解决，将土地财产要回，由你家或那村农会代你儿子经管。直接解决不了的话，可请上级领导机关处理。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　          ——编者
    家中没人在外结了婚是否还可在家分地编者同志：
    有两个问题请教！
    一、有个干部同志原有商业投资七八万元，补助他爱人在某中学读书，他的爱人系公费生。可是，这次在清理机关财产中，个人生产被停止了，他立时感到没办法，于是他说：现在要尊重妇女，我把我这一份送给她，她求她的经济独立，以后再别找我麻烦。我是干部不能投资，她是学生当然可以。他便把资本转给了他的爱人投资。有人说这是投机，又有人说这是正当的，不算错，可是问题也未弄清。
    二、还有一个干部参加工作十几年了，家是贫雇，家里的人被敌人、地主逼害死了，家产也完了，他现在外边结了婚，家口问题没法维持，他想坚持在村里分一份，也不知对不对？他村里是否对他还算做本村一个人口计算。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（李花荡）李花荡同志：你提的两个问题答复如下：
    一、所有私人积蓄一律应按照中央局清理机关生产决定中第四项：“为提倡节约奖励储蓄，防止个人生产之流弊，个人抽回之资财，可由冀南银行储蓄或投入工商贸易部门所设之商店”办法处理。你提出某同志因为要解决他爱人读书的困难，把商业投资改做爱人的名字投资是不对的。因为按着规定把钱存入银行或指定的合作社商店，同样也有红利，他爱人的困难也同样可以解决，完全没有必要那样做。
    二、象这样情况的干部，他和他的老婆当然可以在他自己村里分一份，土地法大纲第十条丙项规定：家居乡村的一切人民解放军，民主政府及人民团体的人员，其本人及其家庭，分给与农民同样的土地及财产。家里虽没了人，村里也应把他计算在内。
