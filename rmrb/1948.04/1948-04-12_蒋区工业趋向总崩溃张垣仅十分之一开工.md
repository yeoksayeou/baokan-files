Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. The industrial and commercial crisis in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas is deepening daily. Factories in Peiping and Tianjin, under the constant extortion of the Chiang bandits, even the bandit Central News Agency was forced to admit on January 22nd that only 20% of them were able to operate, and each factory only operated for half a day, with a sharp decline in production and sales. Shanghai's industry is also trending towards total collapse. According to a Reuters report on the 17th of last month: Shanghai "many factories can no longer bear the constantly increasing burden (referring to the Chiang bandits' exorbitant taxes and other extortions, etc.), and may close down completely"; Wu Kaixian, the Chiang bandit's Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Director, also admitted: "The local industry here is currently facing a crisis." In other news: In Zhangjiakou, under the rule of the Fu Zuoyi bandits, only one-tenth of the large factories are currently operating. After the Lunar New Year, about one-tenth of the city's more than 3,000 businesses will be forced to close down due to the unbearable extortion of the Chiang and Fu bandits.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Tianjin News: The Chiang bandits' rule in Tianjin is characterized by heavy and numerous taxes and levies. There are more than ten major apportionments, such as the so-called "conscription settlement fee," which amounts to 90 billion Chiang currency (hereinafter the same). In order to establish counter-revolutionary local armed forces in Tianjin and "strengthen city defense works," the Chiang bandit Tianjin Municipal Government was instructed to "raise" 60 billion Chiang currency for the construction of barracks, 160 billion Chiang currency to strengthen city defense projects, and 334 billion Chiang currency for the establishment of three security regiments; in addition, there is a so-called Chiang bandit army transit hospitality fee of 10 billion Chiang currency; and 2 billion Chiang currency for the "United Nations Fund for Children's Relief." The above six items alone total 656 billion Chiang currency. The 400 billion Chiang currency "special relief donation" squeezed from the Tianjin area (including Peiping and Tangshan) is not yet included. The industrial and commercial sectors are feeling suffocated, and the situation of the broad masses of the people is even more tragic.

　　蒋区工业趋向总崩溃张垣仅十分之一开工
    【新华社陕北十日电】蒋区工商业危机日益深重。平、津两市工厂在蒋匪不断勒索下，即匪中央社一月二十二日也被迫承认能开工者仅占全数百分之二十，且各厂均开工半天，产销量急剧下降。上海工业亦趋向全部崩溃，据路透社上月十七日电称：上海“许多工厂已不能再担负不断增加的负担（按指蒋匪苛杂及其他勒索等），可能全部关门”；蒋匪上海市社会局长吴开先亦供认：“此间地方工业刻正面临危机。”另息：傅匪作义统治下之张垣，大型工厂开工的现仅十分之一，旧历年关后，全市三千余家商号中，约有十分之一因不堪蒋傅匪勒索将被迫停业。
    【新华社陕北十日电】津讯：蒋匪统治下的天津苛杂繁重。主要摊派共达十多种，如所谓“征兵安家费”即达蒋币（下同）九百亿之多。蒋匪为在津市成立反革命地方武装，及“加强城防工事”，复指令津匪市府筹“募”建筑营房费六百亿元，加强城防工程费一千六百亿元，成立保安团三团费用三千三百四十亿元；此外又有所谓蒋匪军队过境招待费一百亿元；“联合国募集儿童救济基金”二十亿元，仅以上六项即共达六千五百六十亿。划在天津区（包括北平、唐山）搜刮的四千亿元“救济特捐”尚未计算在内。工商界都感喘不过气来，广大市民处境更惨。
