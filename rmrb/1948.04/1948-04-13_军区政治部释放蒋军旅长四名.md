　　Releases Four KMT Brigade Commanders
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Lu Yu, 11th] The Political Department of the Jinji Lu Yu Military Region released four senior commanding officers of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops in mid-March: Li Shouzhen, Major General and Commander of the Reorganized 49th Brigade and Commander of the Second Rapid Column; Yuan Zhishan, Major General and Deputy Brigade Commander of the Reorganized 49th Brigade; Li Keyuan, Major General and Deputy Brigade Commander of the Reorganized 104th Brigade; and Wang Yangzhi (formerly known as Wang Xueyan), Major General and Deputy Brigade Commander of the Reorganized 17th Brigade. They were given ample travel expenses and escorted out of the area. When Li and the others received the notice of their release, they were overjoyed. Li Shouzhen said, "I didn't expect the People's Liberation Army to release us so quickly. This shows that the PLA's policy is indeed lenient and genuine." He immediately wrote to Jiang Tiexiong, Major General and Deputy Commander of the Second Rapid Column, who had been captured with him, urging him to study hard and recognize the future. Furthermore, since May of last year, this region has released a total of 6,485 KMT officers of the rank of colonel or lower; the released generals include Shi Zebo, Commander of the 19th Army of Yan Xishan; Hu Sanyu, Commander of the Artillery of Yan Xishan; and Liu Guangxin, Brigade Commander of the 119th Brigade; Yang Xianming, Brigade Commander of the 104th Brigade; Xie Maoquan, Brigade Commander of the 140th Brigade, and 18 others.
