　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. Prague dispatch: Czechoslovakia's new constitution will be solemnly proclaimed in the capital on May 9th (the third anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Prague). The draft of the new constitution has been approved by the Central Action Committee of the Czech and Slovak National Front and has been submitted to the people for discussion. Every citizen now has a copy of the new draft constitution, and a nationwide discussion, which began on the 18th and will last for fourteen days, has been launched, after which it will be submitted to the Legislative Assembly for final approval. In the preamble to the new draft constitution, the Czech people declare with firm determination to establish a free people's democratic state, guaranteeing that this state will develop towards socialism; they declare their willingness to do their utmost to defend the fruits of the national democratic revolution, so that it will not be subject to any infringement by reactionary forces at home and abroad. The preamble concludes: "Our country should be a national state that eliminates all hostile elements, and maintains friendly relations with the great family of Slavic countries and all peace-loving countries in the world. Our people, through their representatives, shall formulate and implement laws. The national economy should serve the people and should be managed in a way that guarantees the welfare of all, guarantees no economic crises, and ensures the fair distribution of national income." The new draft constitution declares Czechoslovakia to be a people's democratic republic, with all power belonging to the people; it declares Czechoslovakia to be a unified state of two equal Slavic nations—Czechs and Slovaks—and the national territory is complete and indivisible. Article 3 of the new draft constitution states: Working for the public interest and participating in the defense of the country is the general duty of the people. The state guarantees the personal freedom of male and female citizens and provides conditions for all citizens to exercise these freedoms. It guarantees all citizens the right to education, the right to employment, the right to fair remuneration for their work, the right to rest, and the right to support for the elderly and the sick. Article 4 stipulates: A system of universal, equal, direct, and secret voting shall be implemented. Every citizen who has reached the age of eighteen has the right to vote, and every citizen who has reached the age of twenty-one has the right to be elected. The highest legislative body of the state is a unicameral National Assembly, with 300 members, elected every six years. The head of state is the president, elected by the National Assembly for a term of seven years. The government is responsible to the National Assembly and is appointed or dismissed by the president. Article 12 stipulates: The foundation of the economic system is: the nationalization of natural resources, industry, wholesale trade, and finance; land ownership based on the principle of "land to the tiller"; the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises; and the inviolability of private property. The state guides the country's economic activities based on a unified economic plan in accordance with the interests of the people.
