[Report from this newspaper] The Renhe Oil Factory in Xipaifang Street, Linqing City, was founded by Wang Ruiting of Dezhou before the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, it had one 30-horsepower diesel engine and one 31-horsepower electric motor. It had been in business for over 20 years and was very prosperous. After the enemy occupied Linqing, Wang Ruiting was forced to flee to Tianjin, and the remaining staff were also forced to close down after a month or two. After our army liberated Linqing, the municipal government repeatedly wrote letters, asking people to persuade Wang Ruiting to come back and resume operations, but he refused because he did not understand the industrial and commercial policies of the democratic government. Later, the municipal government found his old partner, Pang Qizhong, to go to Tianjin to call him back. Pang Qizhong returned alone on the 20th day of the first lunar month last year. Because the power supply was cut off, he sold the original 30-horsepower electric motor and bought three 6-horsepower small machines, but he did not raise much capital. Last winter, the citizens of Xipaifang Street, seeing that Pang Qizhong was selling the oil factory's property and did not seem to be preparing to open, mistakenly sealed his door. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, which stipulated "protecting the property of industrialists and merchants and their legitimate businesses from infringement," and with the encouragement of the municipal government, Pang Qizhong was no longer afraid. Under the publicity and explanation of the street cadres, the masses and street cadres handed over the keys and opened the door of the Renhe Oil Factory. Now Pang Qizhong is actively preparing to resume operations. Because of the lack of diesel and electricity, and the difficulty in obtaining capital, he plans to sell a machine to the public to turn it into capital, and start small. After starting work, he will use an 8-horsepower vegetable oil machine to press oil, which can process 3,000 jin of soybeans per day, producing 300 to 400 jin of oil, and then gradually develop. After autumn, he plans to call Wang Ruiting back and use the 30-horsepower diesel engine, which can press more than 2,000 jin of oil per day. In addition, he is preparing capital from various sources, inviting technicians, workers, and repairing the house. Pang Qizhong is now smiling all day and full of confidence. He said: "At the latest, we will be able to start work next month!" (Jinan Daily)

　　坚决执行工商业政策改正封户错误
  　仁和油厂筹备复业
    【本报消息】临清市西牌坊街的仁和油厂，是德州王瑞亭抗战前开办的，当时有三十个马力的柴油机一架，三十一个马力的电动机一架，经营二十来年，买卖很是兴隆。敌人占了临清以后，王瑞亭被迫逃到天津，剩下的伙计又干了一两个月，也被迫停业。我军解放临清后，市政府一再写信，托人争取王瑞亭回来再干，终因为他对民主政府的工商业政策不了解，不肯回来。后来市政府又找到他的旧伙友庞起忠，去天津叫他。去年阴历正月二十日，庞起忠一人回来，因为电源断绝，卖了原有的那架三十个马力的电动机，买了三架六个马力的小机器，资本仍没筹备多少。去年冬天，西牌坊街的市民，见庞起忠卖油厂的东西不象准备开门，就错误的给他封了门。土地法大纲上“保护工商业者的财产及其合法的营业不受侵犯”公布后，又受到市政府的多方鼓励，庞起忠不再害怕。在坐街干部宣传解释下，群众街干交出钥匙开了仁和油厂的门。现在庞起忠正积极的筹备恢复。因为缺乏柴油、电力，资本也困难，先卖给公家一部机器，变为资本，打算先从小处干起。开工后用八个马力的植物油机榨油，每天可轧三千斤豆子，出三四百斤油，以后慢慢发展。秋后想法把王瑞亭叫回来，用那架三十个马力的柴油机，每天可榨油两千多斤。另外更从多方面筹备资本。邀请技师、工人、修理房子。庞起忠现在整天笑容满面，信心极高，他说：“最迟下月准能开工！”（冀南日报）
