[From Licheng] After the work team arrived in Tinghepu Village, Second District of Licheng, the masses were unclear about the details of the Land Law and did not know how the work team would proceed. Therefore, they were passive and unwilling to work on production. Some only engaged in side businesses, with all 54 carts in the village hauling stones for factories, grabbing immediate cash. No manure was being transported to the fields, and no one was tending to the village's sheep. Upon discovering these thoughts, the work team focused on dividing labor to lead the masses in organizing spring plowing in conjunction with party rectification. After the Poor Peasants' League was established, the middle peasants became uneasy. Another meeting of all middle and poor peasants in the village was convened. Wang Dexing, an old poor peasant committee member, said to everyone, "We middle and poor peasants are essentially one family. The reason you middle peasants didn't participate in the organization of the Poor Peasants' League is that you turned over earlier than the poor peasants. They suffered even more oppression than us, so they were the first to organize." After this explanation, everyone understood the Poor Peasants' League's basis and spoke out about their confused thoughts. Yang Shuangfeng (a new middle peasant) said, "With each new emperor comes a new court. I don't know who the land will belong to. I only received land two years ago, and now I'm afraid I'll have to give it back." Xu Shuangqin (a middle peasant) said, "I wasn't criticized two years ago, so this year it's my turn. I'll just live one day at a time." Chang Sanyou (a poor peasant) said, "I only turned over two years ago. It doesn't matter if I have to give back the land, but I'm afraid of having to give back grain." Everyone frankly expressed their honest thoughts without any reservations. Wang Pangren said, "The Land Law Outline is for our benefit. Spring is short this year, so we must hurry with spring plowing. If we don't plant the land and don't harvest grain, we will all starve, and we will only be harming ourselves." Then, the comrades of the work team explained the current steps of the party rectification, democratic filling movement, and the policy of uniting with the middle peasants. They clarified that after the establishment of the Poor Peasants' League, a New Peasants' Association would be established, and a Peasants' Representative Conference would be formed. They especially emphasized that the land in Tinghepu would not be greatly changed, only supplemented, and they explained the Border Region Government's proclamation of "whoever plants it, harvests it" in detail. At the same time, they proposed that the party rectification, democratic filling movement, and spring plowing work, two major tasks, should be completed together. They also asked the middle peasants to provide opinions on the current party rectification, and everyone was extremely excited. Wages were immediately discussed and determined, and a ten-day spring plowing plan was set, including plowing and harrowing all the land, transporting all the manure, and planting an average of two trees per person within ten days. There were 198 full laborers and 45 animal teams in the village, with 1817.5 mu of autumn land. Within five days, all 1817.5 mu of land were harrowed and 7690 loads of manure were transported. The cotton fields that had not been plowed last autumn were also plowed. Everyone's morale was very high. Wang Changfu (an old middle peasant) exchanged a donkey for a horse, and Chang Sannv disliked her ox being slow and exchanged it for a donkey at the Dongyangguan market, adding 50,000 yuan. Everyone started early and stayed up late, striving to complete this ten-day plan.

　　停河铺工作组注意生产
  　民主整党结合春耕
    【黎城消息】黎城二区停河铺村，工作组到达后，群众摸不清土地法的底细，更不知工作组怎样来做，因此在生产上消极不动，有的动弹也是专搞副业，全村五十四辆大车，光给工厂拉石头，抓现成（现钱），粪没有往地运，本村的羊也找不到主家，没人卧羊。经发现这些思想，工作组注意分工领导群众结合整党组织春耕。在贫农团成立后，中农有些不安，即又召集全村中贫农会议，首由贫农委员王德兴老汉向大家说：“咱中贫农根本是一家，组织贫农团大家没有参加，是咱中农比贫农早翻了身，他们受压迫比咱还利害，因此先来组织贫农，再来组织大家。”经这样说，大家才摸清贫农团的底，说出自己糊涂想法。杨双凤（新中）说：“一朝皇帝一朝臣，不知土地归何人，我前年才分了地，今年又怕往出退。”徐双琴（中农）说：“前年没斗我，今年就轮上啦，吃了一天算一天。”常三友（贫农）说：“我前年才翻了身，今年往出退地不要紧，就是怕往出退粮食。”大家毫无顾虑地将自己的老实话说出来。王胖仁说：“土地法大纲就是为了咱，今年春又短，还不赶快春耕，种不上地，打不下粮食，大家都得饿肚，还不是自己害了自己。”接着工作组同志把今次整党民主填补运动工作步骤与团结中农的政策作了解释，说明成立了贫农团后，再成立新农会，产生农代会，特别说明停河铺的土地绝不大动，只是抽补，并把边府谁种谁收的布告详细作了解释，同时提出整党民主填补运动与春耕工作，两件大事要一齐完成，并叫中农对目前整党也提供了意见，大家异常兴奋。当即研究确定工资，订出十天春耕计划，在十天内耙完、耙完地，全部运完粪，每人平均栽两棵树。全村全劳力一百九十八个，畜力四十五犋，秋地一千八百一十七亩半，在五天内即将一千八百一十七亩半地全部耢耙完，并运了七千六百九十驮粪，把全村去秋未垡茬的棉田也都犁下了，大家情绪很高。王长富（旧中）用驴换了匹马，常三女嫌牛不快在东阳关会上用牛换了个驴，还贴了五万元。都是起早搭黑，争取完成这十天计划。
