(Cixian News) The Cixian County convened a meeting of district chiefs on the 2nd of this month to review the production work of the past half-month. After more than two days of reporting and discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the production was still in a state of spontaneity due to the failure to resolve the following issues:

I. The leadership at the county and district levels is unsound, and village cadres are lying down and refusing to work. After the reorganization, the county's leadership had some impatience. They believed that the land reform work could be completed in most villages before the wheat harvest. Therefore, they determined that the land reform work was the central task of the county. Almost all cadres participated in the work teams, leaving very few cadres at home, and production work was not mentioned at all. After the instructions of the Central Committee and the Central Bureau were published, they realized that the land reform was a meticulous work. After half a month of experience, they proposed to arrange production and transfer some cadres to lead it. Because the leadership did not pay attention to it, the lower-level cadres also developed some incorrect ideas, so that good cadres participated in the land reform, and cadres with poor ability led the production. The entire cadre corps was afraid of making mistakes and dared not work boldly. Secondly, the leadership method was flawed: one was that fragmented problems were entangled, and production work could not be promoted; the other was that they stubbornly adhered to one village to create experience, ignoring the vast number of villages in the entire district. Village cadres were afraid of struggle and dared not move, pushing big and small problems upwards. Some masses gambled openly, but they did not care, adopting an attitude of not offending anyone. Although these ideas have been resolved somewhat, they are very insufficient. For example, the cadres of Heilongdong Village said after the meeting: We have unloaded the burden, and returned the original things. After returning to the village, there was no meeting to arrange work at all.

II. Landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements took advantage of the masses' dissatisfaction with the cadres and the weakness of the leadership organization to actively spread rumors, making something out of nothing, saying that this village's cadres were embezzling, that village's cadres were sealing off, that the masses were going to struggle against the cadres, etc. ... Cadres and the masses were confused and could not concentrate on production.

III. Disasters and epidemics are serious, which is also a great threat to the masses. Many people are only concerned with making a living, resulting in an emphasis on sideline occupations and a neglect of agriculture. After checking the above reasons, they realized the importance of this year's production work, transferred considerable strength, and appropriately equipped the teams to restore the district committee meetings and specialize in leading production work. They continued to solve the ideological problems of village cadres. The village will be based on the current cadres, absorb middle and poor peasants with production experience, and organize production committees to uniformly lead and promote the production work of the entire village, and organize doctors to fight against seasonal epidemics.

### 从下而上放弃领导磁县生产陷于自流

　　从下而上放弃领导磁县生产陷于自流
    【磁县消息】磁县本月二日召开各区区长会议，检查半月来的生产工作，经过两天多的汇报讨论，一致认为这段工作，因以下几个问题没解决，生产仍陷于自流。
    一、县区领导不健全，村干部躺倒不干。整编后，县的领导思想有些急性病，认为民主填补工作，麦收前大部村庄可以完成，所以确定填补工作是全县中心工作，几乎所有干部都参加了工作队，家里留的干部很少，生产工作根本没提。中央与中央局指示发表后，认识民主填补是个细致工作，又加半月的体验，才提出布置生产，并抽调一些干部领导。由于领导上没有重视，下边干部也产生了一些不正确想法，使好干部参加填补，能力差的干部领导生产。整个干部怕犯错误，不敢大胆工作。其次是领导方法有毛病：一种是零碎问题牵缠住，不能推动生产工作；一种是死守一村创造经验，忽略全区广大村庄，村干部怕斗争不敢动，大小问题往上推，有些群众公开赌钱也不管，采取了是人不惹的态度。这些思想虽经过些解决，但非常不够，如黑龙洞村干部开会回来说：放包袱哩，原物背回来了。回村以后，根本没有开会布置工作。
    二、地主、富农坏分子利用群众对干部的不满，和领导机构薄弱，积极的造谣活动，无中生有，说这村干部扣起了，那村干部门封了，群众要斗争干部哩等……干部群众混乱，不能安心生产。
    三、灾荒瘟荒严重，同样对群众也是个很大的威胁。不少群众只顾糊口，产生重副轻农思想。检查了以上原因，认识了今年生产工作的重要，抽调相当力量，适当配备，恢复各区委会议，专门领导生产工作，继续解决村干部的思想问题，村里以现在干部为基础，吸收有生产经验的中贫农，组织生产委员会，统一领导推动全村生产工作，组织医生向时瘟作斗争。　　　　（王维元）
