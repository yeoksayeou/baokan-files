Editor's Note: Based on reports from the Taihang Branch, we have two suggestions regarding the party rectification work in Nanlixin Village, which we would like to discuss with the work team comrades and readers: First, the village spent a total of eight days from the public exposure of the branch to the punishment of party members, while the party members' self-reflection took more than twenty days. According to experience in various places, closed-door party rectification generally does not yield good results. Therefore, was the public party rectification time in this village too short, thus affecting the full expression of the masses' grievances against bad party members? Second, according to the submitted manuscript, the ideology, work style, and behavior of the bad party members in the village are quite bad. If these bad ideological styles and behaviors are not fully criticized by the masses before the punishment of the party members is announced, is it too hasty, and are the punishments satisfactory to both the party members and the masses? (According to the Taihang Xinhua Daily, Wang Dan (poor peasant) was expelled from the party. Li Sangou (poor peasant) was publicly warned. Gao Shimei (middle peasant) was placed on probation within the party for six months. Du Youtang (poor peasant) was advised to withdraw from the party.)

[Taihang News] The Nanlixin work team in Xiangyuan held a symposium for middle and poor peasants on the morning of March 10th, resolving misunderstandings between the middle and poor peasants, recognizing that the middle and poor peasants are one family, and then entered the party rectification. At the beginning of the party rectification, the work team comrades explained the party program and constitution of the Chinese Communist Party to the masses, explaining what conditions were required to join the party and become a party member. The tasks of the party members were also announced to the masses. At this time, the masses in the meeting hall listened quietly. After everyone understood the party, the list of party members was made public, and the names of all thirteen party members in the village were read out. At this time, everyone was encouraged to boldly raise any opinions on each party member. It was explained that this was responsible for everyone and also responsible for the Communist Party. Because the Communist Party wants to lead everyone to stand up, if any party member does not meet the requirements, everyone should carefully examine them. After the general meeting was mobilized, the discussion was divided into streets. Before the street discussion, the peasant association groups were first organized by everyone freely combining. A total of sixteen groups of men and women were organized. After a day and a half of discussion, each group selected two or three representatives to bring the group's opinions to the branch meeting. A total of thirty-three representatives were selected, including three middle peasants and thirty poor peasants. At the party rectification meeting, representatives from each group and the poor peasant committee members, a total of forty-three people, participated in the branch meeting to review the party members. After each representative arrived at the meeting, the work team comrades gave a brief introduction to the party members' self-reflection over the past twenty days or so; and said: If there are any incomplete areas, you can raise opinions to help the party members reflect well. Then the party members began to talk about their self-reflection to all the representatives. Most of the thirteen party members did not have major problems, some had minor problems, and only a few were not very good. Representatives raised opinions on the spot, most of which were correct, but a few representatives exaggerated or fabricated facts. The intention was to exaggerate the cadres, not to help the party rectification, but to engage in personal revenge. After two representatives criticized the incorrect opinions, the representatives said: Our representatives must represent correct opinions, not exaggerate or shrink, we must clarify right and wrong, and we are responsible to the masses today.

After a period of criticism of incorrect opinions, some representatives' incorrect attitudes turned positive, and they continued to raise opinions to the party members. The old man Yu Dasheng said: Gao Shimei (party member), you must change your attitude in the future! No one in the village is afraid of you! Who doesn't call you Master Gao? Tan Yisheng said: Wang Dan, you are a Communist Party member. The party decided that you would be responsible for delivering grain, but you pretended to be sick and returned to Xiying to engage in corruption. You also called on two women to plot against the village chief. This time you didn't admit your mistake well, and you still have to reflect well in the future! Zhao Jiu only raised the issue of party member Li Meiao: You, the deputy village chief, have no major mistakes, but you can't stand up for the masses. You eat pig heads in the east and sheep heads in the west. "A sorghum stalk is erected behind the door, not as strong as a gun." You don't have a backbone, and you have to change this in the future. After this day's meeting, the representatives brought the materials reflected by the party members to the streets to discuss opinions on the handling of the party members.

When discussing the handling of bad party members, each street was very cautious and responsible, and the right and wrong were clearly distinguished, without any sloppiness. For example, when discussing the political director Ren Youcai, Hou Nu and Du Lai said: Before Ren Youcai became the political director, he was active in his work and did not show any leniency in fighting the landlords; when the enemy was there, he resolutely fought the enemy and led the masses to hide grain and retreat. Since becoming the political director and standing up, he has been planning for himself and doesn't care about us poor people anymore. Huang Changcai and others said: The fruit account of our village, according to Youcai, was used by Deputy District Chief Li Duo to make shoes! Of course, Youcai has made a mistake on this issue, but the Deputy District Chief should be responsible. If you take the account, Deputy District Chief, shouldn't you take a look at what kind of account it is and make shoes in a muddle? Wang Xiaoxun and others said: Youcai took the fruit money to do business, which was entirely for his own big meals and drinks. This is a selfish mistake. As for the matter of exchanging bad land for good land, our appraisers should also be responsible. He said he wanted whatever we gave him, and no one said he had to have this land. We can't chase him for it, we should explain it to the masses. After discussions in each group, everyone discussed the Wang Dan issue. Li Lin only said: This person has no stand and has also beaten farmers. Since he became the chairman of the peasant association, he doesn't even know how many groups the peasant association has, but he is good at corruption. The party decided to have him lead the masses to deliver grain, but he pretended to be sick on the way and returned to the village to engage in corruption. The masses' opinion is that he is not qualified as a party member.

Based on the opinions of the masses on the handling of party members, and in accordance with the principles of the party, the work team timely handled the bad party members after distinguishing right from wrong. On the morning of the 17th, a general meeting of the peasant association was held, with 254 people attending. First, the work team reported the situation of the branch to the masses, explaining the number and composition of the party members, and the overall mistake of the branch was seizing the fruit. Then, the work team, on behalf of the party committee, announced to the masses the punishment of the party members: Ren Youcai is a middle peasant, and his mistakes are: (1) He actively seized 480,000 yuan of fruit and engaged in production with four party members. (2) He created a small clique and beat the village chief. (3) He engaged in big meals and drinks and had a hooligan lifestyle, borrowing two stones of millet from poor peasants and not returning it for a year. (4) He did not reflect thoroughly, and it was decided to place him on probation within the party for six months. Wang Dan, Li Sangou, Gao Shimei, and Du Youtang were also punished. Then, all the party members one by one expressed their attitude in front of the masses, willing to accept the party's punishment; and admitted their past mistakes, hoping that everyone would raise any opinions at any time in the future. The seized fruit money must be handed over completely within six or seven days; in the future, they will work hard, stand with everyone, and strive to do a good job in this leveling (filling movement). The seventy-year-old man Li Dashou said: It's good that we have clarified things like this! The sixty-seven-year-old man Zhang Jinnan said: The party members who have been punished must still get up and do a good job, and as long as they perform well in the future, they can still be good party members. The old man Xu Gen said: Anyone can break a bowl, but it's broken, but you can't break it on purpose (meaning that mistakes are unavoidable, but don't make them deliberately). Huang Changcai said: We should still help the cadres who have made mistakes, and they will be able to transform faster.

### 南里信整党是否充分发扬了民主？

　　南里信整党是否充分发扬了民主？
    编者按：根据太行分社报导，我们对南里信的整党工作有两点意见，提出与工作组同志及读者商讨：一、该村由公开支部到处分党员共费时八天，而党员反省却用二十多天。根据各地经验，关门整党收效一般不大，因此，该村公开整党时间过短，是否影响群众对坏党员积怨的充分申诉？二、根据来稿可以看出，该村坏党员的思想、作风、行为相当恶劣。这些坏思想作风行为，没有得到群众充分批评，即宣布党员的处分，是否操之过急，以及其处分是否党员与群众都感到满意？（根据太行新华日报载：王旦（贫农）开除党籍。李三苟（贫农）当众警告。高世美（中农）留党察看半年。杜有堂（贫农）劝告出党。）
    【太行消息】襄垣南里信工作组于三月十号上午召开了中贫农座谈会，解决了中贫农相互间的误会，认识了中贫农是一家，然后即进入了整党。在整党初，工作组同志便把中国共产党的党纲、党章向群众作了讲解，说明有什么条件，才能参加党，当个党员。又把党员的任务在群众中宣布了一下，这时会场上群众静悄悄的在听着念。当大家了解了党后，便公开了党员的名单，全村十三个党员名字都念过，这时就启发大家对每个党员有什么意见大胆提出。说明这是对大家负责，也是对共产党负责。因为共产党要领导大家翻身，如果哪个党员条件不够，大家要好好审核。经过大会作了动员，才分街讨论。在分街讨论前，先组织农会小组由大家自由结合。共组织了男女十六个小组。经过一天半咯吵，每个小组内选出了代表两三人，带上小组意见参加支部大会。共选出三十三个代表中，中农三个，贫农三十个。整党会上，各组代表和贫农委员，总共四十三人参加支部大会审查党员。各个代表到会以后，工作组同志，先把这二十多天的党员反省，做了个简单介绍；并说：如有不彻底的地方，可提出意见帮助党员好好反省。接着党员们开始向全体代表谈自己的反省。十三个党员都经过代表会上反省，大多数党员没大问题，有些小毛病，只有几个人不很好。当场就有代表提出了意见，大部分提的还正确，只有少数代表夸大或捏造事实。用意在搞夸干部，不是为了帮助整党，是闹私人报复。经两个代表把不正确的意见批判以后，各代表又说：咱们代表，要代表正确意见，不能夸大，也不缩小，是非要弄清，咱今天是对群众负责。
    经过一阵批判不正确意见后，一些代表们的不正确态度才转正，继续向党员提意见。余大胜老汉说：高世美（党员）你这态度今后可得改哩，你在村上哪个人不怕你哩！谁不叫你高老爷。谭义生说：王旦你这个共产党员，在党内决定你去负责送粮，走到西营就装病回来去搞腐化，你还叫上两个妇女定计打村长，这次你也不好好认错，以后你还得好好反省哩！赵九只给党员李美鳌提出：你这副村长倒没有啥错误，可是给群众作不了主，东倒吃猪头，西倒吃羊头，“门背后竖茭圪栏（杆），不顶一支枪”，你没有个主心骨，以后这可得改哩。经过这天会议，代表们把党员反省出来的材料，带到各街开会，讨论对党员处理意见。
    在讨论对坏党员的处理意见时，各街都很慎重，也很负责，是非也分别很清，一点也不马虎。如讨论政治主任任有才时，侯女、杜来二人说：任有才当政治主任前，工作积极，对斗地主也不留情还面；敌人在时，对敌人也坚决斗争，领导群众藏粮退却。自当了政治主任翻了身，就为自己打算，不管咱穷人啦。黄长才等人说：咱村的果实帐，据有才说：给副区长李夺套做鞋用啦！这问题有才当然有错误，但副区长应负责。拿去帐，副区长你就不看看是甚帐，糊里糊涂就做了鞋啦。王小荀等人说：有才拿上果实钱做买卖，这完全是为了他自己大吃二喝，这就是为私的错误。至于说拿坏地换好地的事，咱们评议员也应当负责。他说要什么咱就给他什么，人家又没有说非要这块地不行。这就不能去追人家，咱应给群众解释一下。经过各组讨论，对王旦问题大家展开讨论。李林只说：这个人是个没立场人，还打过农民。自他当上农会主席，他还不知道农会有几个小组，就是能腐化。党内决定叫他带领群众送粮，他到半路上又装病回村搞腐化。群众的意见是他不够个党员条件。
    工作组根据群众对党员处理的意见，又按照党的原则，在分清是非后，便又对坏的党员及时的作了处理。在十七号上午召开全体农会会议，到会人数二百五十四人，首先工作组把支部情况给群众做了报告，说明党员人数和成份，支部总的错误是抓取果实。然后即由工作组代表党委向群众宣布对党员的处分：任有才是个中农，错误是：（一）主动抓果实四十八万元和四个党员搞生产。（二）闹小集团打村长。（三）大吃大喝二流子作风，借贫农小米两石，一年未还。（四）反省的还不透，决定留党察看半年。其余王旦、李三苟、高世美、杜有堂亦均受到处分。接着全部党员一个一个在群众面前表明态度，愿接受党的处分；并承认过去的错误，希望大家以后有什么意见随时提出来。抓的果实款，要在六、七日内全部交出；今后好好工作，要和大家站在一起，努力将这次平分（填补运动）工作做好。七十岁的李大寿老汉说：这样咱把事情闹清就好啦！六十七岁的老汉张锦南说：受了处分的党员，还得起来好好办工作，以后只要表现好，还可以是个好党员。许根的老汉说：谁也好打个碗，不过打是打，可不能故意打（意思是说错误免不了要犯，但不要明知故犯）。黄长才说：犯了错误的干部，咱们还得帮助他些，他就能转变的快些。
