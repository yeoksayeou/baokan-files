　　Filling in Gaps in the Democratic Movement, Thoroughly Reviewing Party Members
  　The Party Rectification in Hexi Village Concludes
    [Report from this newspaper] The Party branch rectification in Hexi Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, has concluded with the completion of the village's land redistribution work. The entire process began with internal self-criticism within the Party, with the main goal of enlightening and guiding Party members, preparing each member to accept review by the masses. However, this initial phase lasted too long (over half a month) and yielded limited results. Based on our experience, however, this short preparatory phase is still necessary. The second step involved publicly listing Party member names and conducting Party rectification by the masses. During this phase, most Party members were honest in their attitude and earnest in their self-criticism. For example, Zhang Qigui had made significant errors, and the masses had the most criticisms of him. However, while feeling great pain, he also addressed each of the twenty-four criticisms raised by the masses and repeatedly stated his position: "I made significant errors in the past and committed many offenses against the masses. I must change. In the future, if the masses need my help, I will serve them sincerely." Other Party members, except for a few who were not serious about their self-criticism and simply gave up, were greatly shaken and realized that they would have no future if they did not reform. Of the thirteen Party members, eight participated in the new peasants' association after being reviewed by the masses, while the five who did not participate felt great pain. At this time, the democratic movement among the masses was surging, and village cadres were re-elected. Some Party members gained the trust of the masses through their actions and were also elected as cadres, showing great enthusiasm in their work. For example, Zhang Zhengming, the Party secretary, underwent a significant transformation in his position and attitude after self-criticism. He not only actively fought against erroneous ideas within the Party but also showed a very humble and sincere attitude during the handover between the old and new cadres, and proactively helped other new cadres become familiar with the village's work. Furthermore, Jia Deming, the director of the cooperative, was re-elected as the director of cooperative production. Immediately after being elected, he accepted the demands of the masses and personally went to Handan to purchase "gelao" (water dippers used for watering gardens, which almost every household in Hexi uses). These actions changed some of the past misunderstandings the masses had about Party members. During this period, the policy of the branch being "open" and never "closed" was adopted. Each branch meeting invited representatives from the poor peasant leagues and peasant associations to participate, asking them to continue helping Party members with their self-criticism. The self-criticism of Party members was also promptly communicated to the masses, and the opinions of the masses were quickly reflected within the Party, closely integrating Party rectification with the mass movement.
    During the democratic land redistribution movement, Party rectification continued. The Party first called on Party members to further subject themselves to review by the masses during the land redistribution, to obey the resolutions of the poor peasant leagues and peasant associations, and to voluntarily return any excess gains. On the issue of returning excess gains, each Party member first reported at the branch meeting what they had gained and what they planned to return. Then, the peasant association小组 (xiǎozǔ: Group) discussed it, and finally, the peasant association committee made a decision based on each individual's situation. Generally speaking, Party members performed very well in this return of excess gains. The masses only raised objections to a few individual Party members, and some Party members who had not gained excess also voluntarily contributed their surplus land and farming tools to help poor peasants and hired laborers to turn their lives around. The masses were very satisfied with these actions, and the relationship between the Party and the masses was further improved. After the land redistribution was completed, a branch meeting was held to summarize the Party rectification, inviting peasant association committee members, group leaders, and representatives selected by each group (including women's representatives), totaling more than thirty people. At the meeting, the chairman announced that, in addition to Party members providing affirmative and clear answers to the opinions raised by the masses, the representatives attending the meeting were asked to comprehensively review each Party member based on their attitude of self-criticism and their performance in the democratic land redistribution movement. They were also asked to offer opinions on whether Party members who had made mistakes should be subject to disciplinary action, for the reference of the Party leadership. Finally, the representatives were given an explanation of the Party's disciplinary measures. Then, each Party member gave a comprehensive report of self-criticism in turn. After each Party member's report, the representatives engaged in very careful and enthusiastic discussions. From the representatives' speeches, it was clear that everyone was able to calmly consider the opinions raised to the Party members from an overall perspective, based on facts, and particularly valued their performance since the Party rectification. For example, after Zhang Zhengming spoke, Pang Guizhi, a women's representative, said: "His attitude has improved a lot this time. Some people say he is corrupt, but that is not true!" Zhang Suoyi then added: "In the past, when cadres caused resentment, we have to look at why they caused resentment. If they caused resentment for work, that doesn't count. If they caused resentment by bullying others, that is a mistake. I think that his climbing to the top (登山:dēngshān) was for work. His active work cannot be considered a mistake." Other representatives also pointed out that Zhang Zhengming's performance since the Party rectification was good and that he should not be punished. When discussing Zhang Wangxi, the representatives pointed out: "The past problems have been self-criticized, but there were also benefits from his past work." Zhang Beifang and Zhang Sanxi both pointed out: "Wangxi was really resolute in leading the struggle against the landlords in the past. He was very good." Finally, when discussing Zhang Yanggen and Zhang Qigui, the representatives' speeches became even more enthusiastic. First, the Zhang Yanggen issue was discussed, and many representatives pointed out: "In the past, Yanggen arbitrarily beat and scolded people. Everyone was afraid of offending him. His performance is still not good this time. He was still scolding people a few days ago." Some representatives suggested: "If his performance is not good, he will still be the same in the future. He has to be punished this time." After everyone's deliberation, it was suggested that Zhang Yanggen be given a disciplinary measure of probation within the Party. When discussing Qigui's issue, after he reported, Jia Zhengfang, the chairman of the peasant association, sternly pointed out: "I don't think your return of the house was a good performance. You were returning this room and then that room, and you were also picking and choosing neighbors, so you were really self-serving!" Zhang Laizi also added: "You are a Party member, but you have always been self-serving. Returning a house and you were still arguing with the peasant association for a long time." Some people also pointed out to Qigui: "Since you became a cadre, you have always been unclear about things, and there has always been corruption." Finally, when discussing the punishment, some people suggested: "Wash him clean!" Some representatives suggested: "Punish him the same as Yanggen. Keep him for a few days to see how he transforms." Those who advocated probation within the Party also stated their reasons. For example, Zhang Chengliang said when speaking: "Let him stay! Don't expel him. He has also done several years of work in the past, and there has not been much corruption. Let's see how he performs in the future." Jia Zhengfang then added: "Hasn't he had any benefits in the past few years?" In the end, it was unanimously agreed to give him a disciplinary measure of probation within the Party.
    At this meeting, the Party members also made defenses against some of the unrealistic opinions raised by the masses, and the representatives also clarified the facts based on the actual situation. For example, when discussing the Wangxi issue, the issue of the old peasant association's fruit accounts not being cleared was involved (Wangxi was the director of the old peasant association). Some people pointed out: "The confusion of the peasant association's accounts cannot be blamed on Wangxi alone. He is illiterate, and the accounts were not handled by him. The confusion is on everyone." Similar issues were given clearer conclusions at the branch meeting that night.
    Immediately the next day, the branch meeting studied the opinions of the masses regarding the punishment of Party members. After repeated and careful study, most Party members agreed to give Yanggen and Qigui the disciplinary measure of probation within the Party. The reasons were: Zhang Qigui has been selfish and self-serving since he became a public security officer, and he has engaged in corruption, but the amount of corruption is not large (the largest instance was embezzling more than seven hundred yuan of black land money in 1943); secondly, during his tenure as a public security officer, he was detached from the masses, attacked the masses, and his position was unstable. His family home once served as a "bomb shelter" for the landlord; however, his attitude in this Party rectification was honest, and his self-criticism was earnest, so it was decided to give him a disciplinary measure of probation within the Party for one year. The reasons for punishing Zhang Yanggen were: he had beaten and scolded the masses, bullied people by virtue of his position (he had fined the sheep worker Beifang two jin of meat and fifty sesame candies because the sheep were placed on his grave); after the Party rectification began, there was still scolding behavior. His personal self-criticism during the Party rectification was not profound, and he did not speak at the meeting, so it was decided to give him a disciplinary measure of probation within the Party for half a year. After discussing the punishment issues, the Party members had heart-to-heart talks and talked about their feelings since the Party rectification. At this time, Zhang Qigui started to cry. While crying, he said: "I was very depressed during the Party rectification. I felt that my mistakes were the biggest. If the rectification had been earlier, it wouldn't have turned out like this." Zhang Yanggen also said: "After the Party rectification started, I thought I was finished, that the Party wouldn't want me anymore, so I gave up and didn't want to say much at the meeting; now I think, if I had been rectified two years ago, the problems would have been corrected earlier. This time the Party didn't expel me and gave me probation within the Party. I am very satisfied, and I will definitely be able to correct my mistakes in the future." Other Party members also had many wrong ideas at the beginning of the Party rectification. Some said: "Party rectification is about fighting cadres, and I couldn't figure it out. If it hadn't been for self-criticism, there wouldn't be the progress today." Some said: "At the beginning of the Party rectification, I thought that I would be bearing the burden of being a cadre and a Party member anyway, and I would have to accept the opinions of the masses whether they were right or wrong. Now it seems that that is not the case at all. It is completely based on facts and reasoning, which is really considered to be saving Party members." They all felt that now it seems that Party rectification is not only a transformation for individuals, but also after clarifying right and wrong through Party rectification, they all felt great pleasure. That night, the work team reported the entire process of the Party rectification, the self-criticism of each Party member, and the punishment decisions to the masses at the peasant association conference. The Party rectification has come to an end, and the branch is now studying how to build the Party in the future.

　　填补民主运动中贯彻审查党员
  　河西群众整党结束
    【本报消息】武安九区河西村的支部整党，随着该村抽补工作的完成亦已结束。整个过程，先是党内反省，主要目的是给党员以启发诱导，使每个党员有接受群众审查的思想准备。但这一阶段时间拖的太久（半个多月），收效不大。但根据我们的经验看，这个短的准备阶段还是必要的。接着第二步骤是从公开党员名单，进行群众整党。在这一阶段中，绝大部分党员态度很老实，反省也认真。如张启贵错误较大，群众对他意见最多，但他一面感到很大痛苦，同时也把群众提出的二十四条意见逐条做了反省，并一再表明态度说：“我过去错误很大，对群众有不少罪过，自己一定要改，以后群众如有用着我的地方，诚心诚意的给服务”。其他党员除个别的不认真反省，干脆躺倒外，都受到了很大震动，感到了改造不好，没出路。十三个党员中，有八个经过群众审查，而参加了新农会，五个未参加感到很大痛苦。这时群众中民主运动正在高涨，改选了村干部，有些党员在行动中取得了群众的信任，也当选了干部，他们都表现工作积极。如支书张正明，经过反省后，立场态度有显著转变，不仅在党内对错误思想作积极斗争，而且在新旧干部交代过程中，态度很虚心诚恳；又主动帮助其他新干部熟悉村上的工作。还有合作社主任贾德明，这次又被选为合作生产主任。当选后即马上接受了群众的要求，亲自跑到邯郸采买“圪老”（即浇园用的水斗子，河西差不多每家都用）。他们这些行动，改变了群众过去对党员一些误解。在这一时期，采取支部“开门”就不再“关门”的方针。每次支部会都邀请贫农团、农会委员参加，请他们继续帮助党员反省；并将党员反省情形随时的转告给群众，群众的意见也能很快的反映到党内来，把整党与群众运动紧密的结合起来。
    在民主抽补运动中，仍然继续了整党工作。党内首先向党员号召：抽补中进一步让群众审查，服从贫农团农会的决议，多得果实自觉的退出来。在退多得果实问题上，先是在支部会上每个党员自报了自己得了些什么？计划退出什么？然后交由农会小组讨论，最后经农会委员会依据各个人的情况做了决定。一般的说来，党员们在这次退多得果实中，都表现的很好，群众只对个别党员提出了意见，有些党员并未多得果实，也自动的拿出了自己多余的土地与农具等，帮助贫雇农翻身。他们的这些表现，群众都很满意，党群关系得到更进一步的改善。填补完毕，又召开支部大会，总结整党，邀请了农会委员、小组长以及各组选的代表（其中妇女也选了代表），共三十余人参加。开会时，主席宣布这次支部会，除党员对群众提出的意见，作肯定明确的答复外；要求参加会议的代表们对每个党员，根据他们的反省态度及在民主抽补运动中的表现，进行全面的审查，对犯错误的党员，如需受到纪律的处分，也要提出意见，以供党的领导上参考，最后给各代表们解释了党有些什么纪律。接着各个党员依次作了综合反省的报告，当每个党员报告后，代表们即很慎重而热烈的讨论。从代表们的发言中充分的看出来，大家这次对党员的提意见，都能冷静的从全面出发，实事求是的，而且特别重视整党以来的表现。如张正明发言后，妇女代表庞桂枝即发言：“他的态度这会改的多了，有人说他贪污，这不是事实！”张锁义也接着发言说：“过去干部惹人要看为啥惹人，为工作惹人不算，要是仗势惹人那才是错误，我看人家登山就是为工作惹人，人家工作积极不能算错误”。其他代表也随着提出，张正明整党以来表现好，不能受处分。讨论到张王喜时，代表们提出：“过去毛病反省了，可是过去工作也有好处”。张北方、张三喜都提出：“王喜过去领导斗地主真算坚决，很不赖”。最后讨论到张羊根与张启贵时，代表们发言愈形热烈。先是讨论张羊根问题，许多代表都指出：“过去羊根随便打人、骂人，谁都怕惹他，这回表现的还不好，前些日子还骂人”。有的代表就提出：“表现不好，再过后还是那个样子就不行，这次得给点处分”。后经过大家的酝酿，提出建议给张羊根留党察看的处分。讨论启贵问题时，他报告后，农会主席贾正方即严正的指出：“我看你这次退房子就表现不好，一会退这间，一会退那间，还要挑选邻家，自谋自利实在厉害！”张来子也随着谈道：“你是个党员，一直自谋自利，退个房子还和农会纠缠了一前晌”。有的人也给启贵指出：“当干部以来办事总不清格，总有贪污”。最后讨论处分时，有一部分人提出：“洗刷了他吧！”有一部分代表提出：“和羊根一样处分。得留他几天，看他转变怎样”。主张留党察看的人，并申述了自己的理由。如张成亮发言时说：“叫他留了吧！不用开除，过去也办了好多几年工作，也没有很大贪污，今后再看看他的表现”。贾正方接着也说：“这几年就没一点好处？”最后还是一致同意给留党察看的处分。
    在这个会上，党员们对群众提出的意见，有些不实际的也都做了声辩，代表们也根据实际情况辨明了是非。如在讨论王喜问题时，就牵扯到旧农会果实帐无清算的问题（王喜是旧农会主任），有人就提出：“农会帐糊涂不能怨王喜一个人，他不识字，帐也没经他手，糊涂是糊涂到大家身上了”。类似这些问题，在当晚支部会上均得出了较明确的结论。
    紧接着第二天又在支部会上研究了群众提出处分党员的意见，经过了反复慎重的研究，大部党员都同意给羊根、启贵二人留党察看的处分。理由是：张启贵自当公安员后，一贯自私自利，且有贪污行为，但贪污数目不大（最大的一次是四三年挪用黑地款七百余元）；其次是在公安员任内，脱离群众，打击过群众，立场不稳，自己家中曾当过地主的“防空洞”；但他在这次整党中态度还老实，反省还认真，决定给予留党察看一年的处分。处分张羊根的理由是：曾打骂群众，仗势讹人（曾罚过羊工北方二斤肉，五十个麻糖，原因是在他坟上放了羊）；在整党开始以后，还有骂人行为。在整党中个人反省不深刻，开会不发言，故决定给予留党察看半年的处分。讨论处分问题以后，党员们又进行了谈心，把自己整党以来的心情都谈了一下。这时张启贵哭起来了，他边哭边说道：“整党期间自己苦闷的很，自己感到错误最大，要早整几年也不会弄成这样”。张羊根也谈到：“开始整党后，我觉得完了，党不会要我了，所以就躺倒了，开会话也不想多说；现在想，要是前二年整我一下，毛病就早改了，这次党还不开除我，给我留党察看，我很满意，以后错误一定能改。”其他党员在整党开始时，也有不少错误想法，有的说：“整党就是斗干部，想不通，要不是经过反省，就不会有今天的进步”。有的表示：“整党开始时，我认为反正是背了当干部党员的伤啦，群众的意见不管对不对都得接受，现在看来并不是那个样，完全是按实际、讲理，这真算是挽救党员”。他们一致的感觉到，现在看起来整党不仅对个人是改造，而且经过整党弄清是非后，都感到了很大的愉快。当晚，工作组在农会大会上，将整党整个过程，及每个党员反省情况、处分决定等，向群众作了报告。整党已告结束，现正在支部内进行研究今后如何建党的问题。
