Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Tokyo dispatch: The wave of strikes in Japan continues to rise. On the 11th, 6,000 employees of private railway and bus companies in Tokyo went on a 24-hour strike, causing transportation between Tokyo and Yokohama to come to a standstill. The sympathy strike of 15,000 employees of the All-Japan Printing Workers' Union is still ongoing. Workers' representatives on the Labor-Management Relations Committee have formally issued a warning to the government, protesting against the government's punishment, without consultation, of government officials who supposedly "violated labor laws." It is reported that the prosecutor of the Saga Prefectural Government recently illegally prosecuted the local tax workers' union on the grounds that it "should be held responsible for the collective leave of tax officials."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Tokyo dispatch: Under the cruel exploitation of Japanese factory owners, the situation of Japanese spinning mill workers is tragic. According to a special survey of working conditions in 400 small spinning mills by the Japanese "Social News" newspaper, it was confirmed that 90% of these mills violated labor laws, with female workers working 11 to 12 hours a day, and many female workers having to work until midnight; the majority are in extremely poor health.
