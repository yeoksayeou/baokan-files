Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd: The Jilin City suburbs' Flax, Paper, and Cement factories have all resumed operations. These three factories were previously run by the Japanese invaders, and later by the Chiang bandits. On the 8th of last month, when the workers discovered that the Chiang bandits had fled, they spontaneously organized themselves and took turns day and night to protect the machinery and materials. After the democratic government took over, they immediately started to resume work. During the Chiang bandit occupation of the Flax factory, the wool rollers and wooden shafts of twenty-two cotton cutting machines were worn out. The workers repaired these damaged machines one by one. Now, four cotton cutting machines and two circular machines have been fitted with wool rollers. On average, they can produce 13.3 jin of thread per hour, compared to only 10 jin during the Chiang bandit occupation. Other machines are being operated and repaired simultaneously, or are being repaired urgently. By the end of the month, all will be in operation, at which time more than 500 jin of thread can be produced every day. The paper mill officially started operating on March 21st. Now it can produce 68.5 bolts of paper per day (50 bolts per ton). Previously, due to the workers' passive resistance to the Chiang bandits, they produced at most 45 bolts of paper a day, and sometimes only 20 bolts. The quality is also better than during the Chiang bandit occupation. For example, before, the paper material was used half good and half bad, and the paper produced was full of lumps. Now, using 80% bad paper material, the paper produced is smooth and good. The cement factory can now produce 1.5 tons of cement per day. Currently, the workers are stepping up the repair of the pulverizer. It can be repaired in another ten days or so, and then the daily output of cement will be more than ten tons.

　　吉林洋灰等三大工厂
  　我接管后产量大增
    【新华社东北廿二日电】吉林市郊亚麻、造纸、洋灰三大工厂现已全部复工。该三工厂过去为日寇经营，后为蒋匪经营，上月八日当工人发觉蒋匪逃跑后，即自动组织起来，日夜轮班保护机器物资。民主政府接管后，他们立即开始复工。亚麻工厂在蒋匪侵占时期廿二架切棉机的毛滚子和木轴子都已磨坏了，工人们就将这些破损的机器逐一修理，现已有四架切棉机和两架圆形机换上了毛滚子，每点钟平均能出线十三斤三两，蒋匪侵占时仅出十斤。其他的机器也在一边开动一边修理，或正加紧修复，月底可全部开动，届时每天可出线五百余斤。造纸厂于三月二十一日正式开工，现每天能出纸六十八匹半（五十匹一吨），以前由于工人对蒋匪消极怠工，一天至多出纸四十五匹，甚至有时只出二十多匹，质量亦较蒋匪侵占时期为好，如以前纸料子是好坏对半用，出的纸还尽是圪塔，现在用八成坏纸料，但是出纸又光又好。洋灰工厂现每天能出一吨半灰，目前工人们在加紧修理粉碎机，再过十来天可修好，每天将产洋灰十几吨。
