Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: TASS, New York - The National Committee of the American-Soviet Friendship Association hosted a grand banquet on the 23rd to welcome the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin. After Senator Taylor and social leader Lamont successively criticized American foreign policy, Pan delivered an impromptu speech, which was interrupted by applause. Pan said: The starting point of Soviet foreign policy is not only that capitalism and socialism can coexist peacefully, but also that effective and mutually beneficial cooperation is possible as long as both sides are sincere. The Soviet Union under the leadership of Marshal Stalin has always adhered to, and still adheres to, peace and international cooperation. The Soviet Union also insists on friendship and the development of economic relations with the United States, believing that this is in the interests of both countries. Pan continued: Certain groups in the United States are trying to sow seeds of hatred between the people of the United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is subject to their terrible distortions and slanders every day, so that the movements of people in some countries striving for freedom and democratic reforms are falsely accused of being Soviet "acts of aggression." But their attempts will never succeed. The people do not want war, and the people do not want to fall into the abyss of war again for the selfish interests of a small group of people. Pan pointed out that the Soviet Union's international cooperation policy is also reflected in its domestic policy. The Soviet Union is full of an atmosphere of peaceful construction, and no one can find a headline in the newspaper that threatens war. After pointing out the importance of cooperation between the two countries, Pan concluded: I firmly believe that the work of the American-Soviet Friendship Association represents the true wishes of the people of our two countries.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: New York - American democratic forces are launching a movement against the Truman government's militarist policies. Seven hundred students from Brooklyn College in New York went on strike for one day on the 19th to protest the proposed reinstatement of the conscription law; and participated in the demonstration against Truman's policies on the same day. Organizations such as the American Progressive Youth Association and the San Francisco American Veterans Committee have sent telegrams to protest Truman's proposal on conscription. Third-party presidential candidate Wallace recently wrote in "New Republic" magazine that "the war frenzy stirred up by a group of irresponsible war-mongers in Washington" is an attempt to establish an American version of a police state, restrict the freedom of people who are dissatisfied with the government's current policies, prevent labor's wage increase movement, enable large companies to obtain huge profits from large military expenditures, and serve as a prerequisite for controlling the world. Wallace had previously criticized Truman in a speech on the evening of the 18th for wanting to use the lives of American youth to prevent the democratic demands of people around the world and threaten the right to survival of people around the world. Former US Secretary of the Interior Ickes said in his New York Post column that Truman has found that he is increasingly at a disadvantage in the election, so he may create "crises" one after another to achieve his goal of not "changing horses midstream" and clinging to power.

　　苏驻美大使潘友新演说称
  　苏坚持一贯和平外交
    指责美帝散布两国仇视种子
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美苏友好协会全国委员会二十三日盛宴欢迎苏驻美大使潘友新。潘氏在参议员泰勒、社会领袖拉蒙特相继抨击美国外交政策后，即席发表演说，其演说时为掌声所打断。潘氏说：苏联外交政策的出发点，不仅认为资本主义与社会主义有和平共居的可能，而且只要双方有诚意，还认为存在着有效的双方有利的合作的可能。斯大林元帅领导下的苏联，经常坚持，现在仍然坚持和平与国际合作。苏联也坚持与美国的友谊和经济关系的发展，深信这符合于两国的利益。潘氏继称：美国某些集团力图在美苏两国人民间散布仇视的种子，苏联的外交政策，无日不受他们可怕的曲解与诽谤，以至某些国家中人民争取的自由、民主改革的运动，都被诬为苏联的“侵略行动”。但是他们这种企图决不会成功，人民不愿战争，人民不愿为一小撮人的自私利益而再陷入战争的深渊。潘氏指出：苏联的国际合作政策也反映在它的国内政策上，苏联国内充满和平建设的空气，谁也找不出报上有一条以战争相威胁的标题。潘氏在指出两国合作的重要性后，结语称：我深信美苏友好协会的工作，是表示了我们两国人民的真正愿望。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】纽约讯：美民主势力展开反杜鲁门政府军国主义政策的运动。纽约布鲁克林大学七百名学生于十九日罢课一日，抗议恢复征兵法的建议；并参加当日反杜鲁门政策的示威游行。美进步青年公民协会及旧金山美退伍军人委员会等团体，纷纷通电抗议杜鲁门关于征兵的建议。第三党总统候选人华莱士近在“新共和”杂志上著文指出：“华盛顿一群不负责任的战贩所喧起的战争狂”，是企图建立美国版的警察国家，限制不满政府现行政策人们的自由权利，阻止劳工的增资运动，使大公司从大笔军费中获取厚利，并作为控制全球的先决条件。华氏前在十八日晚的演说中，曾斥杜鲁门想利用美国青年的生命去阻止世界各地人民的民主要求，威胁世界人民的生存权利。美前内长伊克斯在其纽约邮报专文中说：杜鲁门发觉他在竞选中日益处于劣势，因此他可能还会制造一次次的“危机”，来达到其“中途不换马”的恋栈目的。
