[Hesun News] A total of twenty-five villages in Hesun County are undergoing supplementation (initially only eighteen villages). On March 21st, the County Committee convened a central group meeting of all work groups to report on thirty days of work. Although some achievements and experiences were gained during this period, there were also many shortcomings, leading the work astray. First, there was a universal viewpoint of hostility and exclusion towards the old organizations, along with a phenomenon of unprincipled pulling without solving problems, but the bias of hostile sentiment was fundamental. This caused considerable losses to the work. Old cadres lay down and refused to work, the masses were misled and afraid to become cadres, and some elements with impure motives took the opportunity to settle personal grudges and strike blows. A widespread phenomenon of cadres being afraid, anxious, and even seeking death or taking poison formed. Instead of reflecting on their mistakes, they were resentful and dissatisfied with the leadership, feeling that there was no way out. The leadership did not try to rectify these comrades, but instead suppressed them all, causing some new party members and party members with minor errors to say: "It is said that the Communist Party is a vanguard organization, and we are willing to make progress. As soon as we join, we are caught up in self-criticism, and the masses also oppose us. It's better not to join." They regretted joining the Communist Party and did not want to be party members. They misunderstood party rectification, thinking that it was not about rectifying impurities within the party, but about rectifying all party members. Second, there was a closed-doorism bias in rectifying the mass ranks, along with arbitrary development and expulsion. When joining the Farmers' Association, money was paid to join; in order to prevent middle peasants from being elected, votes for middle peasants were sabotaged, etc. Third, there was a "leftist" sentiment in class demarcation, following the tail of the masses, elevating well-to-do middle peasants to rich peasants, seeking reasons to classify middle peasants as well-to-do middle peasants, and even creating terms like "traitor middle peasants." The purpose was to have "reasons" when redistributing land, and they believed that this was "beneficial" to the poor peasants and hired laborers. In reality, it was undermining their own ranks and increasing the enemies of the poor peasants and hired laborers. Finally, the publicity of the Land Law Outline was insufficient, and they were timid and hesitant, publicizing some parts secretly and not publicizing others. They only spoke to the middle peasants about the middle peasants' interests and only spoke to the poor peasants about the poor peasants' interests, failing to allow them to understand the full picture of the Land Law. These errors of pure task viewpoint, eagerness for quick success, and one-sided and isolated poor peasant viewpoints have all been criticized and corrected.

At the end of the joint meeting, the spring plowing work was reviewed and arranged. It was reviewed that the main obstacles to the current spring plowing work were the masses' waiting for land redistribution and the village cadres' failure to lead, and the lack of a dedicated person in charge of the central group, which caused the spring plowing work to drift. In order to overcome this phenomenon, the central groups went down to strengthen the leadership of the spring plowing work and specifically determined: (1) The central group assigned a dedicated person to be responsible, and a part of the work group's cadres were drawn to form a production work leading group. Each base village must have a district cadre specifically leading production. (2) The thinking of village cadres was straightened out, and poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants were absorbed to form a village spring plowing committee to lead production. (3) The Land Law Outline and the Border Government's policy of "whoever plants it harvests it" during spring plowing were comprehensively publicized. Villages that have not yet been supplemented will conduct some situation investigations to lay the foundation for supplementation. (4) Investigate the spring famine, provide relief to disaster victims, and issue loans. The county has loaned a total of 28 million yuan. (County Committee)

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Editor's Note: The "leftist" bias in Hesun's party rectification and supplementation should arouse serious vigilance in various places. The leadership should inspect the work of work groups in various places in a timely manner. If biases are found, they must be corrected immediately with a serious attitude and should not be delayed; otherwise, the work cannot proceed smoothly, and the consequences will be very serious.

　　和顺工作团左倾情绪作祟
  　制造理由提高成份
  　县委检查纠正但不够坚决明确
    【和顺消息】和顺全县进行抽补的共二十五个村（开始只十八个村）。县委会于三月二十一日，召集各工作团的中心组会议，汇报三十天的工作。这一段虽获得些成绩与经验，但也有不少缺点，以致工作走了弯路。首先是对老组织一律仇视排挤观点，同时也有不解决问题，无原则的拉的现象，但仇视情绪的偏向是基本的。这使工作受到不少损失。旧干部躺倒不干，群众产生错觉不敢当干部，一部分动机不纯的分子，公报私仇趁机打击，普遍的形成干部害怕、着急，甚至寻死、服毒等现象。他们不是反省错误，而是气愤、不满领导，感到没出路。在领导上不是想把这部分同志整好，而是一律压倒，因此使一部分新党员和错误小的党员说：“说共产党是先锋组织，咱愿意进步，刚参加就赶上反省，群众也反对，不如不参加。”他们后悔参加共产党，不愿当党员，他们对整党发生误解，以为不是整顿党内不纯，而是把一切党员都整掉。其次是整顿群众队伍的关门主义偏向，同时也有随便的发展、开除。在参加农会时，出钱入会；为了怕中农当选，破坏中农选票等。再次是在划分阶级上“左”的情绪，做了群众的尾巴，把富裕中农提成富农，多方寻找理由，把中农划成富裕中农，还有什么“汉奸中农”。目的是想在抽地时有“理由”，而且认为这是“有利”于贫雇，实际上是破坏了自己的阵容，增加了贫雇的敌人。最后是宣传土地法大纲不够，而是畏首畏尾，偷偷摸摸的宣传这部分，不宣传那部分，对中农只说中农的，对贫农只说贫农的，不能使他们了解土地法的全貌。以上这些单纯的任务观点，急于求成和片面的孤立的贫雇观点的错误，均予批判纠正。
    联席会最后，把春耕工作作了检讨与布置。检讨出当前春耕工作主要障碍是群众的等待抽补思想，和村干部的不领导，中心组没有专人负责等，因此使春耕工作自流。为了克服这现象，各中心组下去，加强春耕工作的领导，具体确定：（一）中心组抽专人负责，并抽出一部分工作团的干部，组成生产工作领导小组，每个基点村必须有一个区干部专门领导生产。（二）打通村干部思想，吸收贫雇中农组成村春耕委员会，领导生产。（三）全面的宣传土地法大纲及边府春耕中谁种谁收的政策。未填补的村，进行些情况调查，打下抽补的基础。（四）调查春荒，救济灾民，发放贷款，全县共贷款二千八百万元。（县委会）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：和顺在整党填补中“左”的偏向，应引起各地严重警惕。领导上要适时检查各地工作组的工作，如发现偏向，必须以严肃态度立即纠正，不要拖延；否则工作不能顺利进行，恶果也会很大的。
