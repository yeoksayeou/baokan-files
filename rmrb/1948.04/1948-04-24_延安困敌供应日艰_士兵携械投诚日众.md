　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 22nd: The Hu bandit troops entrenched in the isolated city of Yan'an are experiencing extreme supply difficulties due to the disruption of transportation by our forces and repeated attacks by our guerrillas. Soldiers' rations have been reduced from twelve taels to nine taels per day, and the rations for local puppet troops are even less. The bandit troops, fearing our army's attacks, are shrinking into their bunkers day and night, and their morale is declining further. Soldiers of the Twelfth Brigade said, "The army commander (referring to Liu Kan) and division commander (referring to Yan Ming) cannot escape their fate, leaving us to die for them. Let the Liberation Army attack, and we'll surrender our weapons to save our lives!" As a result, the number of soldiers deserting or defecting to our side has been increasing recently. After our victory at Yichuan, prices soared. Millet rose from 1.5 million to 2.1 million National Currency per斗, and salt rose from 26,000 to 50,000 National Currency per斤, but even then, there was no supply. Most of the shops were forced to close due to extortion and looting. The people's lives are even more miserable.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 22nd: Local armed guerrilla forces in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are constantly attacking the isolated enemy in cities such as Yan'an, causing the Hu bandit puppet troops to waver even more. One evening, more than 50 members of the Third Detachment of the enemy's security police force stationed in Chuankou, Yan'an, revolted completely under the leadership of their commander and deputy commander, and cooperated with our guerrilla forces to annihilate the puppet township office and the enemy's Twelfth Brigade plainclothes team, capturing more than ten bandits, including the deputy commander of the security police battalion, detachment leaders, and township office instructors. Soldiers such as Wang Tiancai of the Third Company of the puppet Chunhua County Security Police Battalion also revolted with weapons on the 24th of last month, and escorted the deputy commander of the puppet self-defense corps to our side. A certain company of the Ansai Guerrilla Detachment, led by combat hero Yue Yufeng, stormed into Qilipu in Yan'an City, destroyed the enemy police station, and killed or wounded five enemy soldiers. In March, local armed guerrilla forces in the Yan'an Sub-district annihilated 205 enemy security police above the battalion commander level, and won over 178 puppet security police who brought their weapons to our side, seizing seven light machine guns and 116 rifles and pistols. Furthermore, local armed forces in the Longdong Sub-district advanced into the Sancha Town area west of Quzi on the 28th of last month. The defending enemy of more than 100 fled upon hearing the news, and our local armed forces pursued them for more than 20 li, defeating more than 300 enemy reinforcements, killing or wounding 11 enemy soldiers, and capturing 20 puppet security captains and below.

　　延安困敌供应日艰　士兵携械投诚日众
    【新华社西北二十二日电】困守延安孤城胡匪军因交通被我切断，又迭遭我游击队袭击，供应极为困难，士兵口粮由每天十二两减至九两，地方杂伪口粮尤少。匪军慑于我军攻击，日夜龟缩碉堡内，士气更形低落。十二旅的士兵们说：“军长（指刘戡）师长（指严明）都逃不了性命，丢下咱们这些卖命鬼，让解放军攻来，缴枪救条命吧！”因而最近士兵逃亡或向我投诚者日众。我宜川大捷后，物价即飞涨，小米每斗由一百五十万元蒋币涨至二百一十万元，盐每斤由二万六千元涨至五万元，但也是有市无货。各商店更在勒索抢掠下，十之七、八关门歇业。人民生活更痛苦不堪。
    【新华社西北二十二日电】陕甘宁边区地方武装游击队，不断袭击延安等城孤敌，胡匪杂伪益形动摇。一日晚驻延安川口敌保警队三分队五十余人，在正副队长率领下全部起义，并配合我游击队歼灭伪乡公所及敌十二旅便衣队，共俘匪保警大队附二个分队长和乡公所指导员等十余人。伪淳化县保警大队三连士兵王天才等十四人也于上月二十四日携械起义，并将伪自卫总队副绑送我方。安塞游击支队某中队在战斗英雄岳玉峰率领下，一举攻进延市七里铺，捣毁敌警察分所，毙伤敌五名。延属分区地方武装游击队三月份共歼敌保警大队长以下二百零五人，争取伪保警队携械来归者共一百七十八人，缴轻机枪七挺、长短枪一百一十六支。又：陇东分区地方武装，上月二十八日挺进曲子以西的三岔镇地区作战，守敌百余闻风逃窜，我地武追击二十余里，击溃援敌三百余，毙伤敌十一人，俘伪保安队长以下二十名。
