    Labor Policy and Tax Policy for Developing Industry
    Chen Boda
    (1)
    The increase in industries manufacturing tools and daily necessities in the liberated areas, and the inability to meet the demand, have inspired the infinite prospects of the rapid development of China's new industry after the liberation of peasants. The great sign of industrial productivity is especially reflected in the workers' new enthusiasm for production.
    In the liberated areas, on the one hand, the workers' attitude towards labor has undergone unprecedented changes. The workers' slogan is "Establish a new attitude towards labor." Establishing a new attitude towards labor is a new movement of the working class in the liberated areas, and the most important driving force for promoting the advancement of productive forces under the New Democratic economic system in China. The Railway Workers' Representative Conference in one city has listed the establishment of a new attitude towards labor as one of the work programs of the trade union. According to data from some public factories, workers adopted a "go slow" attitude during the period of Japanese and Kuomintang rule to cope with the oppression of the Japanese and Kuomintang. Sometimes, a trip to the toilet could take half an hour or an hour, and eating was slow. But now the workers say that they can't "go slow" like that anymore, because they are now working for the people themselves. In the past, after the whistle blew for work, workers would still drag their feet a bit before starting work, but now, as soon as they hear the whistle, they rush to work. In the past, stealing materials for livelihood or lacking a sense of responsibility in work and wasting materials were common phenomena. Now, workers have fundamentally changed their attitude towards such situations. For example, if someone steals something, the workers will automatically chase after them to get it back. All of these are the most active factors in the current development of industrial productivity in the liberated areas. The railway workers' road repair situation in a newly liberated city can be said to be a typical example of improving production efficiency. Originally, it took eight people to lift a rail, then it was reduced to six, and then to four. In the past, one person carried two fishplates each time, but now some carry as many as twenty-two, with an average of eight. In the past, it took an average of two people to carry a sleeper, but now it takes an average of one person, with a record of three sleepers per person. In the past, two hundred people could repair six hundred meters of road in a day, but now they can repair an average of one thousand five hundred meters a day, with a maximum of three thousand and fifty meters, exceeding all historical records. The iron factory attached to the railway is in the same situation: in the past, a team of twelve or thirteen people could produce fifty or sixty pieces of certain railway equipment in a day, but now the maximum can reach one hundred and fifty pieces, and the average can be maintained at one hundred and thirty or forty pieces; in the past, a machine could produce forty or fifty screws, but now it can produce seventy or eighty. In one cotton mill, it used to take twelve hours of work to produce one pound of yarn, but now it takes eight hours of work to produce the same one pound of yarn. In one iron factory, ten hours of work now is better than twelve hours of work in the past. Such examples are too numerous to mention. This is a manifestation of the unprecedented improvement in the workers' political awareness. Consolidating and continuing to improve the workers' political awareness by all means will be the most reliable guarantee for building a New Democratic national economy. Not only is this the case in these public factories; in private capital enterprises, where labor-capital relations are properly handled, the workers' attitude towards labor has also undergone new changes, and there are often new facts of improving production efficiency.
    On the other hand, the free bourgeoisie is amazed by the vastness of the market after the liberation of the peasants. They are afraid that goods cannot be produced, not that they cannot be sold. Therefore, they have aroused great interest and enthusiasm for industrial management. Many iron industry capitalists are planning how to expand their production business, only worrying about the lack of materials to supply the production of production tools. In a newly liberated city, the private cotton textile industry has developed from more than twenty to more than one hundred, while in the past, under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, it had decreased from fifty in the era of Japanese occupation to more than twenty. The free bourgeoisie has found a real way out for developing industry in the liberated areas.
    The industrial upsurge that has already begun in the liberated areas following land reform, and the improvement in industrial production efficiency to varying degrees, are the first step in the change in industrial productive forces. This change in industrial productive forces, like the change in agricultural productive forces after land reform, demonstrates the superiority and inevitable victory of the New Democratic economic system, while the feudal comprador and bureaucratic capital economic system is extremely decadent and destined to die.
    (2)
    The industrial policy of the Chinese Communist Party is the policy of "develop production, prosper the economy, consider both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital" proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong. All aspects of the Communist Party's economic policy proceed from protecting production and developing production. Policies that deviate from the starting point of developing production will be wrong policies. In land reform, the Communist Party firmly protected industry and commerce; in the workers' movement, after the Communist Party lifted the feudal oppression and shackles remaining on the workers, it firmly opposed "Left" adventurism that excessively increased wages and damaged production; the democratic government under the leadership of the Communist Party also strived to provide convenient conditions for industrial development loans and commodity circulation. In order to enable industry to continuously obtain raw materials and expand production, the expanded mining of coal, iron, and other minerals has also become a task that our party and the democratic government need to pay attention to.
    After eliminating the feudal land system and eliminating bureaucratic capital to establish the broadest premise for the development of Chinese industry, and implementing a firm protection policy for national industry, the policies that are of fundamental significance for the development of industry can be summarized as two policies: one is labor policy, and the other is tax policy.
    First, regarding labor policy. The main issues of this policy are wages and trade unions.
    On the issue of wages, some old liberated areas have had the following erroneous situations: that is, deviating from the general production level and living standard there, ignoring the specific conditions of the factory, and thus proposing excessively high labor conditions, excessively increasing wages, making the workers live a particularly comfortable life, and at the same time making it difficult to sell the products of the factory because the production costs are too expensive, and of course it becomes impossible for the factory to expand production. Some factories even cannot support themselves with their own production, and some public factories (referring to ordinary industrial public factories) even need a lot of government financial supplements to keep the factory running. Some comrades who support this approach feel that this is "protecting the interests of workers." The reason why this idea or this approach is wrong is because the result is not only unable to develop industry, but also inevitably makes the nascent or immature industry shrink, or causes the factory to close down. This is a suicidal policy in the workers' movement. At the same time, this forced, artificial, unprincipled, and blind, that is, unreasonable, excessive increase in wages cannot improve the political awareness of the working class, cannot encourage their efforts in production and saving; and it will make some workers have a wrong idea, leading them to take a vulgar economism path, making them feel that they can have living privileges, and this will also make the workers and other social laborers, especially the peasants, have mutual discrimination and friction in life. Therefore, this is not protecting the interests of workers, but on the contrary, it is fundamentally violating the interests of the working class. Therefore, we must never adopt this policy. This is one aspect.
    On the other hand, after opposing the above-mentioned erroneous tendencies, another tendency may occur or has already occurred, that is, ignoring that the correct handling of the wage issue can greatly promote the forward development of productive forces, and regardless of whether production efficiency has increased or not, uniformly limiting wages to the initial low level, and not giving appropriate rewards to workers and staff who particularly strive to improve production and reduce costs, and not giving appropriate punishments to workers and staff who slack off, waste materials, or embezzle and engage in corruption, and so on. It is very clear that this policy will also damage the production enthusiasm of workers and staff. Also very wrong is the so-called "living equality" advocated for technicians and ordinary workers, and the salaries of technicians and staff are suppressed too low, which of course will also damage the production enthusiasm of technicians, and will similarly affect the production enthusiasm of workers to pursue progress. Of course, the working class is the most advanced and most revolutionary class in the Chinese people, and it is the class of leaders of the Chinese revolution. They are able to accept correct political mobilization and intensify their production enthusiasm. In many newly liberated areas, the production enthusiasm of the workers - especially the workers in public factories - is first raised by the encouragement of political liberation. However, if this enthusiasm is not constantly consolidated by a reasonable New Democratic economic system, relying solely on political encouragement cannot continue to improve, and may not even be able to be maintained constantly. Therefore, there must be a correct wage policy that can constantly stimulate the production enthusiasm of workers and staff. The correct wage policy should be based on the general living conditions of the local area at that time, based on the old wages before liberation, and make reasonable and appropriate adjustments, and on this basis, implement reasonable and appropriate progressive wage systems such as piecework, grade-based, point-based, and saving-based (reducing production costs), as well as progressive reward systems such as profit sharing based on labor. This system must be based on the specific conditions of various industrial sectors and the specific conditions of each factory, with the factory director responsible, and discussed with the factory management committee and the wage assessment committee, and with worker representatives and the worker masses, absorbing the past and present experiences of this factory and other factories, deciding or adopting this method, or adopting that method, or flexibly and interchangeably adopting both or several methods, and the factory and workers should conclude specific agreements on production plans and wage conditions or reward methods, and the assessment of work should emphasize both the quantity and quality of production. Working hours and wages between factories should be agreed upon with each other, and all should reach reasonable regulations, but some differences should be allowed based on the specific conditions of each factory, and it is impossible to be completely equal. In short, everything should be based on the prerequisite that it is conducive to constantly improving production as a decision. For the salaries of technicians and staff, a similar system needs to be adopted. On the basis of maintaining the actual old salaries, according to their new labor achievements, savings (reducing production costs), or new creations, they should be progressively graded. There is no doubt that establishing this wage system or reward system based on new and old experiences will greatly encourage the production enthusiasm of workers and staff, rigorously enforce labor discipline in factories, improve the labor organization of factories, improve the quantity and quality of products, eliminate waste, monitor theft and embezzlement, reduce various unproductive consumption, and continuously improve the skills of workers and staff, so that those who are technologically backward catch up with those who are advanced, and those who are advanced seek newer progress. This is an extremely important system for promoting the advancement of productive forces. This is the material foundation for consolidating and developing the new labor attitude of workers and staff. Implementing this system can increase the production efficiency of factories by 50%, 100%, or even higher. In this way, although the wage expenditure of the factory increases compared to before, the increase in production income is much greater than the increase in wages, so that the future is difficult to measure. Some comrades are not good at making this kind of enterprise calculation for developing production, are bound by the old eight-part essay style of work, cannot see the prospect of the development of productive forces, and are afraid to establish such a system in public factories. This is completely wrong. Some comrades feel that implementing this system will encourage the "wage labor concept" of workers. This is also very wrong. Do not forget: we are now establishing a New Democratic economic system, and we are still allowing free capitalism to develop, not having already realized a communist society. It is impossible to eliminate the wage labor concept of workers. In reality, this is a reactionary fantasy that violates the laws of social development. Under the piecework wage system and other similar systems, the "wage labor concept" of workers getting more rewards for doing more production - or saying that they do more production in order to get more rewards - is not harmful, but reasonable and progressive. Workers get more rewards because they put in more labor and ability. On the one hand, they promote the advancement of social productive forces, and on the other hand, they can supply farmers with more, cheaper, that is, relatively cheap industrial products. In this way, it can also be considered reasonable by farmers and all social laborers, or it can strengthen the unity between workers and farmers and all social laborers. It is true that implementing this wage system is difficult, because this system requires precise supervision, inspection, and calculation. However, this difficulty can be easily overcome through mass evaluation. This wage system or reward system must be established on a possible and voluntary basis for the masses. This wage system or reward system represents the interests of the development of social productive forces, and also represents the individual and collective interests of the worker masses. Therefore, it is easy to arouse and constantly maintain the conscious upsurge of competition in production and saving among the worker masses, and it is easy for the masses themselves to establish a system of mass mutual supervision, mutual inspection, and mutual evaluation, so that those workers, technicians, and staff who work actively, are good at saving, and cherish public property can receive the rewards they deserve, and those who slack off, waste materials, and steal and embezzle can receive the punishments they deserve.
    This wage system and reward system that stimulates production has been adopted by many private capital factories, and has accumulated a lot of experience, and has obtained a lot of benefits in management. In the future, they should also be encouraged (but not forced) to adopt them reasonably and freely, and public factories should learn from the many different reasonable and very useful experiences they already have.
    Another important issue in labor policy, namely the trade union issue, has also raised completely new issues in the liberated areas. The labor movement and trade union work in the liberated areas should, under the correct slogan of workers establishing a new attitude towards labor mentioned above, encourage the workers' enthusiasm for production, promote workers in public and private factories and the factory (the factory director, manager, and factory management committee in public factories, and private capitalists and managers in private factories) to jointly discuss and conclude agreements on production plans and wages, and constantly concentrate on the experience of production to educate workers, and turn our trade unions into schools of New Democratic politics and production. At the same time, establish cooperatives in various factories to seek welfare for workers. This kind of cooperative should have the dual nature of consumption and production: on the one hand, it supplies workers with consumer goods, so that the workers' wages are not affected or less affected by fluctuations in market prices; on the other hand, it helps workers solve the difficulties of family production, so that workers can work with peace of mind. Now, due to frequent fluctuations in prices, it is difficult to stipulate workers' wages. Some factories stipulate wages according to the price of rice, coal, cloth, and other commodities each month, but this is very complicated, and workers will also suffer some losses. If workers' cooperatives can take on the task of supplying workers with necessities, and not change the prices of various commodities within a certain period, that is, allocate a certain quantity of various necessities to workers, then wages will not change within a certain period. Workers will not suffer losses either. A relatively fixed price in-kind allocation system is the most able to protect the interests of workers during wartime. This requires the consistent efforts of the government, trade unions, and cooperatives to implement well. Trade unions and cooperatives should use great efforts to achieve this. It should be said that many of our comrades working in trade unions are not yet familiar with these things. But everything is as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The important thing is to be good at learning."
    (3)
    Second, regarding tax policy.
    Our party's program is to protect industry and commerce. But industry is more fundamental than commerce. Industry produces social wealth, while commerce (referring to legitimate commerce) only fulfills the function of commodity circulation, which is an economic activity indispensable for the development of production in a certain society. Therefore, commerce must be protected so that it can smoothly fulfill its reasonable function in a certain society. But commerce does not produce social wealth. At a certain symposium, some industrial capitalists proposed that there should be some differences in the taxation of industry and commerce. Industrial taxes should be lighter than commercial taxes in order to promote the development of production. Obviously, this requirement is reasonable and should become one of the principles of the tax policy in the liberated areas. This is the first principle of industrial and commercial taxes. At the same time, at that symposium, it was also jointly agreed that among the various industrial sectors, the industrial tax for manufacturing production tools and daily necessities should also be different from the industrial tax for manufacturing luxury goods and non-essential goods, that is, the industrial tax for manufacturing production tools and daily necessities needs to be lighter than the industrial tax for manufacturing luxury goods and non-essential goods. Obviously, this opinion is also reasonable. This is the second principle of industrial and commercial taxes. The third principle of industrial and commercial taxes is to replace the various exorbitant taxes and levies of the Kuomintang tyrannical era with a single tax. These principles of industrial taxes proceed from protecting the production of industry, from protecting the correct direction of industrial development, and guaranteeing that all industries manufacturing production tools and daily necessities have the possibility of continuous expanded reproduction. Turning these principles into reality will have many complex problems, and we have very little experience in this type of thing in the past, but the key to actually solving these problems is still in being good at learning. It is difficult to implement normal industrial and commercial income taxes in the early days of liberation or under the current conditions. Localities can take some transitional measures based on specific circumstances. For example, at the symposium mentioned above, our comrades once discussed a transitional method of industrial and commercial tax with those industrial capitalists: that is, the government tax authorities, based on the specific circumstances of the number of factories, capital, business, and so on in various industries in the local area, proposed a tax revenue figure for a certain period (such as half a year or a year) for the industry, and consulted with the capitalists of the industry on whether this amount is appropriate, that is, it is borne jointly by the capitalists of the industry, and then within the industry, each factory democratically discusses, reports publicly, and fairly distributes the burden according to its ability, first operating and then paying taxes, and during this period of burden, regardless of how much the factory's production expands, no additional taxes are added. The industrial capitalists who participated in the symposium unanimously welcomed this transitional method. They felt that this method was easy to handle, and more importantly, this transitional method can also promote the free competition of various factories to expand production or improve production technology. The amount of payment is also publicly discussed by everyone, and everyone in the industry is very familiar with each other, so it is difficult to be selfish and cheat. It can be said that it is beneficial to both the public and private sectors. Before a normal industrial and commercial income tax can be smoothly implemented, it is very necessary for localities to implement transitional tax methods similar to this that are beneficial and harmless to the development of production. And in the initial stage of the trial implementation, because experience is still lacking, and at the same time, it is a new encouragement for investment and operation, it is appropriate for the number of taxes to be set relatively low.
    (4)
    Due to the victory of the People's Liberation War, we will liberate more and larger cities, and with the development of industry and commerce after land reform, dealing with specific policy issues of industry and commerce has become a daily agenda that our party must pay attention to. Constantly concentrating experience and mass opinions, determining methods, and correcting errors, this can guarantee that we correctly implement Comrade Mao Zedong's theories and policies.

    发展工业的劳动政策与税收政策
    陈伯达
    （一）
    各解放区制造工具的工业和制造人民生活必需品的工业之增加与供不应求，鼓舞了农民解放后中国新工业迅速发展的无限前途，而工业生产力的伟大标志，更特别表现在工人对于生产的新的积极性。
    在解放了的地方之一方面，是工人的劳动态度发生了从所未有的变化。工人们的口号，叫做“建立新的劳动态度”。建立新的劳动态度，这是解放区工人阶级新的运动，是中国工人阶级在新民主主义经济制度下推动生产力前进的最主要的动力。有一个城市的铁路工人代表会，已把建立新的劳动态度列为工会的工作纲领之一。根据一些公营工厂的资料，工人们在日寇和国民党统治时期，采取“磨洋工”的态度，去对付日寇和国民党的压迫，有时一次大小便，也可以拖它半个钟头或一个钟头，吃饭慢吞吞，但现在工人们说，可不能那末“磨洋工”了，现在是给人民自己干活了。过去上工的笛声响了之后，工人们还要这样那样拖点上工的时间，现在一听到笛声，就赶着上工了。过去为了生活而偷盗材料，或在工作中缺乏责任心而浪费材料，乃是通常的现象，现在工人们对这样情况，已有根本的改变，如有个别偷盗的，工人们就自动去追回来。所有这些，乃是目前解放区工业生产力发展最积极的因素。一个刚解放不久的城市，那里铁路工人修路的情况，可说是提高生产效率的一种典型。原来一根铁轨要八个人抬，随后就减为六个人，再后又减为四个人了。过去背夹板是一个人每次背两块，现在有的竟背到二十二块，平均是背八块。过去抬枕木，平均两个人一块，现在平均一个人一块，最高纪录是一个人三块。过去修路，两百人一天修六百米，现在平均一天修一千五百米，最高达到三千零五十米，超过过去历史上的一切纪录。铁路附设的铁工厂，同样是这种情况：过去某种铁路器材，一天一班十二三人出五六十块，现在最高可达到一百五十块，平均可保持一百三四十块；螺丝过去一个架出四五十条，现在可出七八十条。有一个纱厂，过去工作十二小时，生产一磅纱，现在工作八小时，也同样生产一磅纱。有一个铁工厂，现在十小时的工作，比过去十二小时的工作还强。诸如此类，不能一一列举。这是工人们政治觉悟空前提高的表现。用一切方法巩固并继续提高工人们的这种政治觉悟，将是建设新民主主义国家经济最可靠的保障。不仅是这类公营工厂是这样；在私人资本的企业中，劳资关系处理的正确，那里工人们的劳动态度，也同样起了新的变化，经常有提高生产效率的新鲜事实出现。
    另一方面，自由资产阶级则惊羡农民解放后市场的广阔，他们怕的是货出不来，不怕货卖不出去，因而对于工业经营激起了极大的兴趣和热忱。许多铁工业的资本家，都在计划如何扩大自己的生产事业，只因为材料不够供给生产工具的生产而着急。一个解放不久的城市，私人棉织业即由二十多家发展到一百多家，而过去在蒋介石匪帮统治下，却由日寇占领时代的五十家减到二十多家。自由资产阶级在解放区找到了发展工业的真正出路。
    目前解放区继土地改革而已经开端的工业高潮，以及工业生产效率在各种程度上的提高，这是工业生产力向上第一步的变化，这种工业生产力向上的变化，正如土地改革后农业生产力向上的变化一样，说明了新民主主义的经济制度的优越性及其必然胜利，而封建买办与官僚资本的经济制度，则极端腐朽及其必然死亡。
    （二）
    中国共产党的工业政策，是毛泽东同志所提出的“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的政策。共产党经济政策的一切方面，是从保护生产和发展生产出发。离开发展生产这一个出发点的政策，将是错误的政策。在土地改革中，共产党坚定地保护工商业；在职工运动中，共产党解除残留在工人身上的封建性的压迫和束缚以后，坚定地反对过分提高工资及破坏生产的“左”倾冒险主义；共产党领导下的民主政府并努力对于工业发展的贷款和货物流通等等给了便利的条件。为着使得工业能够不断获得原料而扩大生产，对于煤铁及其他矿物的扩大采掘，也已成为我们党和民主政府需要重视的任务。
    在消灭封建土地制度和消灭官僚资本而为中国工业发展建立最广大的前提，并对民族工业实行坚定的保护政策之后，对于发展工业的政策有根本意义的，概括说来，是两个政策：一个是劳动政策，另一个是税收政策。
    第一、是关于劳动政策。这个政策主要的问题，是工资问题与工会问题。
    在工资问题上，过去某些老解放区有过这样错误的情况，即脱离那里的一般生产水平和生活水平，忽视工厂的具体条件，因而提出过高的劳动条件，过分地提高工资，使得工人们过着特别优裕的生活，同时也就使得该项工厂因为生产成本太贵，生产品不容易卖出，而该项工厂要扩大生产当然也就成为不可能，有的工厂甚至因此不能以厂养厂，而在有些公营工厂（指普通工业的公营工厂）中竟至需要政府的很多财政补充，才可能使该工厂继续开工下去。若干拥护这种办法的同志，觉得这样就是“保护工人利益”。这种想法或这种办法之所以错误，就是因为其结果不但不能够发展工业，并且不可免地使初生的或幼稚的工业陷于萎缩，或使工厂得到关门的结果。这是工人运动中一种自杀的政策。同时，这种勉强人为的，无原则的，盲目的，即不合理的过分提高工资的方法，也不能够提高工人阶级的政治觉悟，不能够鼓励他们对生产与节约的努力；并且会使得有些工人们起了一种错误的想法，使他们走上庸俗的经济主义的道路，使他们觉得可以有生活的特权，而这也就会使得工人们与其他的社会劳动人们，特别是与农民们之间，发生生活上的互相歧视与磨擦。所以，这样并不就是保护工人利益，相反，这是在根本上违反着工人阶级利益的。所以这种政策我们决不能采取。这是一方面。
    另一方面，在反对上述的错误偏向之后，也可能发生出或已发生出另一种偏向，即忽视工资问题的正确处理能够大踏步地推进生产力向前发展，而不问生产效率是否增进，却一律把工资限定在最初的低的水平线上，对于特别努力提高生产和减低成本的工人和职员，没有适当的奖励，对于怠工和浪费材料或贪污舞弊的工人和职员，没有适当的处分，等等。很明白：这种政策，也将损坏工人和职员们的生产积极性。还有很错误的，即主张技术人员与普通工人的所谓“生活平等”，而对于技术人员和职员的薪水压得过低，这当然也会损坏技术人员的生产积极性，并同样地会反转而影响到损坏工人们追求进步的生产积极性。当然，工人阶级是中国人民中最先进、最革命的阶级，是中国革命领导者的阶级，他们是能够接受正确的政治动员，而加紧自己的生产积极性的，很多新解放了的地方，那里工人们——特别是公营工厂的工人们的生产积极性，首先是受到政治解放的鼓舞而提高起来的。但是，这种积极性，如果没有经常合理的新民主主义经济制度来加以巩固，只专靠政治的鼓舞，是不能继续提高，甚至不能经常保持的。因此，必须有正确的经常能刺激工人职员生产积极性的工资政策。正确的工资政策，应该是根据当地当时的一般生活条件，以解放前的旧工资为基础，加以合理的与适当的调整，并在这个基础上，实行按件、按等、按分、按节约（减低生产成本）……等类的合理与适当的累进工资制度，以及按劳分红等类的累进奖励制度。这种制度，须根据各种工业部门的具体情况，各个工厂的具体条件，由厂长负责，与工厂管理委员会及工资评定委员会商量，与工人代表及工人群众商量，吸收本厂的与别厂的过去和现在的经验，决定或采用这样办法，或采用那样办法，或对于两样几样的办法都交错地灵活变通采用，并由厂方与工人缔结生产计划与工资条件或奖励办法的具体协定，而工作的考核则都要把生产的数量与质量并重。在各工厂之间的工时与工资，应互相协议，一律达到合理的规定，但应根据各厂的具体情况，允许若干差别，不可能完全一律平等。总之，一切以对于经常能提高生产有利作为决定的先决条件。对于技师和职员的薪水，同样需要采用这类似的制度，在保持实际的旧薪水的基础上，根据他们工作的新劳绩，节约（减低生产成本），或新创造，而按等累进。毫无疑问，根据新旧的经验、建立这种工资制度或奖励制度，将极大地鼓舞工人们与职员们的生产热忱，严肃职工的劳动纪律，改善工厂的劳动组织，提高生产品的数量与质量，杜绝浪费，监视偷盗与贪污舞弊，减少各种不生产的消耗，并不断提高工人们与职员们的技能，使技术落后的赶上先进的，而先进的又求更新的进步。这是推动生产力前进极重要的制度。这是巩固和发挥工人们与职员们新的劳动态度的物质基础。实行这种制度，使工厂的生产效率可能增加到百分之五十，百分之百，以至比这更高，这样，工厂的工资支出虽然比前增加，可是生产收入的增加却比工资的增加要大的很多，以至前途是难于计量。有些同志不善于作这种发展生产的企业计算，受陈旧的八股式工作所束缚，看不见生产力发展的前途，害怕在公营工厂中建立这样的制度。这是完全错误的。有的同志觉得实行这种制度会鼓励工人们的“雇佣观念”。这也是很错误的。不要忘记：我们现在是建立新民主主义的经济制度，还让自由资本主义发展，而不是已实现了共产主义社会，要消灭工人们的雇佣观念是不可能的，在实际上这是违反社会发展规律的一种反动的空想。在按件工资等类制度下，工人们因为进行更多的生产而得到更多的报酬——或者说是因为求得更多的报酬而进行更多的生产——的“雇佣观念”，并没有害处，而且是合理的，进步的。工人们取得更多的报酬，是由于出了更多的劳力与能力，一方面促进了社会生产力的前进，另一方面，可能以更多的，生产成本更低的，即比较廉价的工业品供给农民，这样，也就能够被农民和一切的社会劳动分子认为合理，或也就可以更加强工人和农民及一切社会劳动分子之间的团结。诚然，实行这种工资制度，是有困难的，因为这种制度需要精确的监督检查与计算。但是，这种困难，是容易经过群众的评定来克服的。这种工资制度或奖励制度，必须建立在可能的与群众自愿的基础上。这种工资制度或奖励制度，将代表社会生产力发展的利益，也代表工人群众的个人和全体的利益，所以，就容易激起并得经常保持工人群众生产与节约的竞赛的自觉热潮，并容易由群众自己来建立一种群众互相监察，互相检查，互相评定的制度，使那些积极工作，善于节约，爱护公物的工人、技师和职员，获得应有的奖励，而使那些怠工、浪费物资、偷盗贪污的人受到应有的处罚。
    这种刺激生产的工资制度与奖励制度，在私人资本的工厂中，已有很多采用的，积了不少的经验，在经营上获得很多利益，今后同样地应该鼓励（但不得强迫）他们合理地自由采用，而公营工厂应当向他们学习已经有了的这种许多不同的合理的很有用的经验。
    关于劳动政策中的又一重要问题，即工会问题，在解放区也提出了完全新的问题。解放区的职工运动和工会工作，应该在上述工人们建立新的劳动态度的正确口号下，鼓励工人们生产的积极性，促进公私工厂的工人与厂方（公营工厂是厂长、经理及工厂管理委员会，私营工厂是私人资本家及经理等）共同商量缔结生产计划与工资的协定，并经常集中生产的经验教育工人，把我们的工会变为新民主主义的政治与生产的学校。同时，在各工厂创办为工人谋福利的合作社，这种合作社应当具有消费与生产的双重性质：一方面，供给工人消费品，使工人们的工资不受或少受市场上物价波动的影响，另一方面，帮助工人解决家庭生产的困难，使工人得以安心工作。现在由于物价经常波动，使规定工人工资发生困难，有些工厂按每月米煤布等实物价格来规定工资，不过这是非常繁杂的，工人也要受些损失。工人合作社如能担负供给工人必需品的任务，在一定时期内不变动各种物价，即在一定数量上配给工人各种必需的实物，则可使工资在一定时期内不致变动。工人也不受损失。比较固定价格的实物配给制，是战时比较最能保护工人利益的。这须要政府、工会与合作社的一致努力，才能很好的实行，工会与合作社就应用大力来办到这一点。应该说，我们许多在工会工作中的同志，对于这些事情，是还不熟悉的。但一切正如毛泽东同志所说，“重要的问题在善于学习”。

    第二，关于税收政策。
    我们党的纲领是保护工商业。但工业比起商业来，工业又是最基本的。工业生产社会的财富，而商业（指正当的商业）只是尽商品流通的职能，是在一定社会中发展生产所不可缺少的一种经济活动，故必须保护商业，使其能够顺利地尽其一定社会的合理的职能。但商业并不生产社会的财富。曾在某一个座谈会上，有些工业资本家提出工业与商业的税收，应该有些区别，工业税比商业税更需要从轻，以便促进生产的发展。显然，这种要求是合理的，应该成为解放区税收政策的原则之一。这是工商业税的第一个原则。同时，在那个座谈会上，又共同同意：在工业各部门之中，对于制造生产工具及人民生活必需品的工业税，也应该与制造奢侈品及非必需品的工业税有区别，即制造生产工具及人民生活必需品的工业税比制造奢侈品及非必需品的工业税，又需要从轻。显然，这种意见也是合理的。这是工商业税的第二个原则。工商业税的第三个原则，就是用单一税去代替国民党暴政时代五花八门的苛捐杂税。这些工业税的原则，乃是从保护工业的生产出发，从保护工业发展的正确方向出发，并保障那一切制造生产工具和人民生活必需品的工业有不断扩大再生产的可能性。把这些原则变成实际，会有不少复杂的问题，而我们过去对这类的经验又很缺乏，但实际解决这些问题的关键，也仍然是在善于学习。正常的工商业所得税，在解放初期或目前的条件下，实行起来，当然还有些困难，各地方斟酌具体情况，是可以采取一些过渡的办法的。例如，在上述的那个座谈会上，我们同志曾经和那些工业资本家商量出工商税一种过渡的办法：即由政府税收机关根据当地各种行业的厂号，资本，营业等等具体情况，拟出一定期间（比如半年或一年）的该业税收数字，并和该业资本家商议此项数目是否适当，即由该业资本家共同担负下来，然后在该同业内，由各厂号民主讨论，自报公议，按能力公平分配负担，先营业，后纳税，而在这个负担的期间内，除交纳这个数目外，不问该工厂的生产如何扩大，不再加税。参加座谈会的工业资本家，一致欢迎这种过渡的办法，他们觉得这种办法好办，而更重要的，是这种过渡办法还可促进各工厂扩大生产或改善生产技术的自由竞争，交纳多少又是经过大家公议，同业之间彼此都很熟悉，很难自私作弊，可说是公私两利。在还不能顺利实行正常的工商业所得税之前，各地实行类似这种对于发展生产有利无害的过渡的税收办法，是很有必要的。而在试行的初期，因为经验还缺乏，同时，是对于投资和经营的新鼓励，税收的数目是应该以定得比较低些为适宜。
    （四）
    由于人民解放战争的胜利，我们将解放更多更大的城市，以及土地改革后工商业的发展，处理工商业的具体政策问题，已成为我们党日常须要注意的议事日程。经常集中经验与群众意见，定出方法，修正错误，这就能够保证我们正确地执行毛泽东同志的理论与政策。
