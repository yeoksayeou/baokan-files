Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 17th: Postal workers in the North China area, amidst frequent battles, work hard and persist in their duties, maintaining connections between various regions and successfully completing their tasks, with many heroic models emerging. At the Sheng-Ba (newly established Shengfang-Ba County) County Post Office commendation conference last month, postal worker Ye Xiangrong was selected as a hero. During an enemy mopping-up operation, he persisted in his work in a certain village for more than twenty days, grasped the situation, ate only one meal a day, and was surrounded twice, but resolutely completed the liaison mission. Postal workers Bai Guangrong, Li Yupeng, and two others fought against Wang Nigang's regiment in a village in Jin-Wu, repelling the enemy, killing and wounding more than forty, and seizing two guns, each earning a merit.

Another dispatch: Frontline military postal workers complete mailing tasks during continuous combat and marching, ensuring smooth communication between the front and rear. Postal workers implement relay systems, greatly improving walking speed, carrying dozens of pounds on their backs daily, and traveling over a hundred *li*.

Brave Postal Workers
Crossing Rivers on Ice

The spring wind has thinned the ice in the Wen'anwa area. Boats cannot travel, and people dare not walk. Postal workers cross this five-*li* stretch of melting ice every day, heading to the north bank of the Daqing River. One dark night, Hu Depeng fell through seven times, climbing up each time. Ice fragments pierced his feet and legs, and the blood froze together when he reached the shore, his whole body losing sensation. Every postal worker had piercing wounds, but they still crossed every day, shift after shift, without interruption. When they felt very cold, they thought of the suffering people north of the Daqing River, and they thought, "The task assigned by the Party is extremely important; we must move forward even if it's colder."

The Daqing River, seven or eight *chi* deep, is covered with a thin layer of ice, impossible for ducks to swim or people to walk. They rolled across it, one by one, day after day... The ice melted. One night, Ma Jun and Li Shutian, leading a group of cadres, had just arrived at the riverbank when they heard the enemy's "password" calls and saw the glare of electric batons. Ma Jun and Li Shutian felt as if they were on fire. "Swimming is an option, but we're afraid the comrades will drown or can't withstand the cold, and we're afraid of being discovered by the enemy and making a mistake." Old Ma and the others took off their cotton-padded clothes and floated across, bringing the boat over. When the comrades safely crossed to the other side, Comrade Ma Jun was so chilled by the wind that he could not move. He struggled to say two or three sentences and could say no more. When he reached his destination and met his comrades, he cheerfully recounted the experience of crossing on ice, without a word of complaint. They escorted hundreds of cadres without a single loss, but none of them boasted about their contributions.

Night March

Villages along the communication lines were full of enemies. Postal worker heroes broke through the Sheng (Fang) Ba (County) highway, crossed the Zhongting River, avoided the villages, and marched on the open fields in the dark, endless lowlands. Hearing the enemy's password shouts, they maneuvered around them. Sometimes they encountered enemy sentries, and they fought if they did. Li Hexuan's group fought for three nights in a row, fighting and rushing forward. Sometimes they stepped over fields of sorghum stalks, their eyes fixed ahead, their ears listening to their surroundings, gently lifting their feet and gently placing them down, without a sound, groping forward in this way. In foggy or rainy weather, with no stars in the sky and unable to see their hands in front of their faces, they lost contact and direction, wandering a hundred *li* or more in a single night, still unable to reach their destination. At dawn, they hid, waiting to break out again when it got dark. One day, Ji Kaitian, Xiao Yanshun, Chen Fuquan, Li Hexuan, Li Shutian, and others lost their direction and walked until dawn, encountering enemies setting out in three routes to surround the village. Running or retreating was dangerous. Li Hexuan and the six others swore, "We will resolutely break through if the enemy can't hold us back. The documents are as important as our lives, and we will live and die with them." The six divided into three groups, spaced themselves apart, carried their guns, and advanced calmly. The enemy mistook them for their own troops, and the six postal worker heroes finally broke through the encirclement victoriously.

Holding the Position

Zhang Enbo, stationed at a certain station, maintained contact with various regions. When the enemy surrounded villages and carried out "combing" and "clearing" operations, he continued his work as usual. When the enemy came, he went underground. When the enemy "combed," he prepared for battle, eating one meal a day as usual. Wang Liancheng hadn't slept on a *kang* for a month. Besides contacting various regions, he seized every opportunity to develop his secret bunkers. One day, Zhou Wenkuan and Li Shusen traveled seventy *li* at night and had just slept for less than an hour when the enemy surrounded the village. They immediately got up and held out until dark, wounding an enemy and returning to their original station on time. Wang Fulin cooperated with the militia in a certain village to fight from tall buildings. The enemy charged wildly, but they fought stubbornly, blocking the enemy's advance. In the end, the enemy dragged away more than twenty dead and wounded and fled back. The heroes stood firm, holding their positions in this way.

In February, the Chiang-Fu bandits, in coordination with Wang Nigang, concentrated more than a dozen regiments to repeatedly carry out a net-like "mopping-up" operation towards the north bank of the Daqing River. The postal workers broke through the enemy's strongholds and highway blockades, overcoming cold, hunger, fatigue, and all difficulties, day and night, coming and going. In frequent battles, with ingenuity, courage, and unwavering determination, they maintained connections between various regions, never losing a single letter or newspaper, never delaying a single document, and victoriously completing their tasks.

　　大清河北邮工坚持工作
  　四个人打退匪一个团
    【新华社晋察冀十七日电】大清河北邮工在频繁的战斗中，艰苦奋斗，坚持工作，保持了各地联系，胜利完成任务并涌现大批英雄模范。上月胜霸（新设县胜芳霸县）县邮局评功大会上邮工叶向荣当选英雄，他在敌人扫荡时，于某村坚持工作二十多天，掌握情况，每天只吃一顿饭，被包围两次，但坚决完成了联系任务。邮工白光荣、李玉朋等四人于津武某村，与王逆凤岗一个团作战，将敌人击退，打死打伤敌人四十多人，并缴获两支枪，每人立了一功。
    又讯：前线军邮在连续作战行军中，完成邮寄任务，保证了前后方联系畅通，邮工实行接力，步行速率大大提高，每日身背数十斤，行程百里以上。
    英勇的邮工
    踏冰渡河
    春风吹薄了文安洼的冰，船不能行，人不敢走，邮工们就天天通过这五里长的消冰，奔向大清河北。一天黑夜，胡德朋漏下去了七次，漏下去又爬上来，冰渣扎破了脚和腿，上了岸血水又冻在一起，浑身失去了知觉。邮工们每个人都有扎破的伤，他们还是天天一班挨一班过，从没间断过一次。冻的难受的时候，就想起了大清河北灾难的人民，就想起“党交付的任务万分重要，再冷些也要前进。”
    七八尺深的大清河蒙着一层薄冰，凫不能凫，走不能走，他们就一个个的滚过去，一天、两天………冰化了。有一天深夜里，马俊、李书田带着一批干部，刚到河沿，四外传来敌人“口令”声，打过来电棒的光芒；马俊、李书田心里象着了火，“游水吧，怕把同志们淹死或挨不住冻，又怕被敌人发觉出了闪错”。老马他们脱了棉衣凫浮过去，把船摆过来。当同志们安然摆过对岸的时候，马俊同志已被风刮的不能走动，他挣扎着说了两三句话，再也说不出来了。当他到了目的地，和同志相见时，却又愉快的告诉着踏冰过水的经历，没有一句怨言。他们护送成千成百的干部，没受过一次损失，但他们谁也没有夸过功劳。
    夜行军
    沿着交通线上的村庄都扎满了敌人，邮工英雄们突过胜（芳）霸（县）公路，穿过中亭河，闪开村庄，踏着生地，在黑呼呼的漫洼里行进，听到敌人口令的叫喊，他们便机动的绕过去，有时和敌人的哨兵遭遇，遇上就打。李和轩组一连打了三夜仗，一面打，一面冲过去。有时踏过满地的高粱楂，眼盯着前头，耳听着周围，轻轻的抬起脚，又轻轻的放下去，没有一点响声，就这样摸索着前进。赶上雾天雨天，天上没有星，伸手不见掌，失了联系转了向，一宿转百十里地，还转不到目的地，天亮了就隐蔽起来，等天黑再突出去。有一天纪开田、肖彦顺、陈福全、李和轩、李书田等转了向，走到天亮，正遇上敌人三路出发，包围村庄，跑或退都是危险的，李和轩六人宣誓说：“敌人拉不上手，坚决突过去。人在文件在，与文件共存亡。”六人分了三个组，拉开距离，扛着大枪，沉着前进，敌人误以为是他们自己的队伍，六个邮工英雄终于胜利冲出重围。
    坚持阵地
    住在某站的张恩波，为保持各地联系，当敌人村村包围“剔抉”“清剿”的时候，照常的工作。敌人来了即转入地下工作，敌人“剔抉”，就准备战斗，一天吃一顿，习以为常，王连成一个月没在炕上睡过觉，除和各地联系，就抓紧一切空隙开辟自己的秘密堡垒。有一天，周文宽、李树森，夜行七十里，刚睡觉不到一个钟头，敌人包围了村庄，马上起来坚持到黑，打伤了一个敌人，又按时返回原站。王福林在某村，配合民兵打高房战，敌人疯狂的冲，他们顽强的打，阻击着敌人的前进；最后敌人拖着二十多死的伤的窜回去。英雄们就这样屹立不动的坚持阵地。
    二月里，蒋傅匪配合王逆凤岗，集中十几个团的兵力，向大清河北进行反复拉网“扫荡”，邮工们冲破敌人的点盘和公路层层封锁，征服了冷、饿、疲劳和一切困难，日日夜夜，来来往往，在频繁的战斗中，以机智、勇敢、和顽强不屈的决心，保持了各地的联系，没丢过一封信，一张报，没积压过一份文件，胜利的完成了任务。（镜明）
