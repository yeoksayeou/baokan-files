    Ci County Gaojiazhuang Yang Tingbi writes that
    The work team is doing things incorrectly
    Should not casually use corporal punishment
    Hope the Gaojiazhuang work team will investigate and reply.

    Comrade Editor:
    In the land reform movement, our village discovered unreasonable things. I have been angry about this issue for several days, with nowhere to express my grievances. After seeing the recent newspaper reports about some problems that occurred during the land reform, I dared to boldly complain to you.
    After the work team came to our village, they merged this village with Junjiaying Village and convened two mass meetings. The first meeting announced the Land Law policy, and the second meeting mentioned the organization of a poor peasant association. At that time, the person in charge of the work team asked Gao Wenlu: "How many poor peasant households are there in your village now?" He said: "Probably fifteen or sixteen poor peasant households." Now the poor peasant association has been organized (our village is a very small village, with only twenty-odd households in total). Who are the people participating in the poor peasant association? There are a few households from other places, and all the people in the village with the surname Gao, fifteen or sixteen households in total, are all in it. Since the poor peasant association was formed, my family's actions have been interfered with. I can give two examples: One day, when my own sister returned to her husband's home, four or five people from the village searched her from head to toe when she left. After this happened, even relatives and friends have been afraid to come to our house recently. My mother is so scared that she doesn't weave cloth anymore, and she doesn't have the energy to do the work in the fields.

    Secondly, I am studying at the Sixth Elementary School in Lintan. On the morning of April 5th, the person in charge of the school told the students: Whoever owes the school food rice, please pay it off today. I also owed rice, so I went home to get the rice and went to Lintan with Yang Xihe's relatives. Unexpectedly, people from Junjiaying Village detained me and wanted to lock me up. I said: Don't lock me up! I will absolutely not run away. They immediately convened a temporary meeting (whether it was the poor peasant association or the peasant representative meeting, I don't know), and brought me to the meeting. People from the work team were present, and Gao Wenlu asked me: "Are you sabotaging the Land Law?" I replied: "What is sabotaging the Land Law? I don't know." Others asked: "Are you transporting grain with Yang Xihe?" I replied: I am bringing rice for the school. Some people said: "You are talking nonsense, not telling the truth." Then they used corporal punishment (benches, bricks, ropes) to interrogate me: "Will you tell us or not?" They repeatedly questioned me, but I did not admit it. Later, they used a softer method, pulled me aside, and asked me individually, "You four people studying at the school are united, what is the matter with Gao Wenlu?" etc., which scared me so much that I cried. Seeing this situation, they didn't continue to ask, and told me to go back and said we would talk about it tomorrow! It wasn't until the afternoon of the fourth day that they called me back to school, and the millet was given to me. (Yang Tingbi, Gaojiazhuang, Eighth District, Ci County)

    (Yang Tingbi's uncle, Yang Xihe, was previously accused by the poor peasants of Gaojiazhuang in this newspaper of bullying others (see the first edition of February 6th). The occurrence of this incident may be related to this. It is hoped that the work team in the village will investigate and handle it correctly. But no matter what, the use of corporal punishment is wrong.

    磁县高家庄杨廷璧来信说
    工作组做事不对
    不该随便用刑罚
    希高家庄工作组检查答复编辑同志：
    在实行土改运动中，俺村发现了不合理的事，我对于这个问题，生气了好几天，有冤无处说，看到最近报纸上登载的关于土改中发生的一些问题后，才敢大胆的向你们诉苦。
    工作组来到俺村后，将这村与军家营村合并起来，召集了二次全体群众大会。第一次会议宣布了土地法政策，第二次会议，提到要组织贫农团。当时，工作组负责人问高文禄：“你们村上现在有多少户贫农？”他说：“大概有十五、六户贫雇。”现在贫农团已组织好了（俺村是个很小村，全村共有二十几户）。有些什么人参加贫农团呢？有几家外来户，和全村所有姓高的，十五、六户统统都在里面。自从有了贫农团，俺家的人在行动上都被人家干涉。我可举出两个例子来：有一天，我的亲姐姐回婆家，出门时村上有四、五人，将她全身上下都被检查一遍。这事情发生后，近来连亲戚朋友都不敢来咱家了，吓得我的母亲布也不织了，地里的活也做得不起劲了。
    其次，我在林坛六高小念书，四月五号的早晨，校里负责人对同学们说：谁欠学校的火食米，今天将米交清。我也欠米，因此我就回家拿米，和杨希和的亲戚一同往林坛，不料被军家营村的人扣住，要把我锁起来。我说：你们不要锁吧！我绝对不会跑。他们马上就召集临时会议（是否贫农团或农代会我不知道），将我带到会上，在场有工作组的人，并有高文禄问我：“你是不是破坏土地法？”我答：“破坏土地法是些什么东西？我不清楚。”还有其他人问：“你是否与杨希和运粮？”我答：我是给校拿米。又有些人说：“你胡说，不实际。”就用刑罚（板凳、砖、绳子）拷问：“你说不说？”反复的追问，我没承认。后来又用软的办法，把我拉在一边，个别的问我，你们四人在校念书团结在一块，对高文禄有什么事没有等等的话，吓得我没法就哭了。他们看到这种情况，再没有继续问，就叫我回来，说明天再说吧！一直等到第四天下午才叫我回校，小米也给了我。（磁县八区高家庄杨廷璧）
    （杨廷璧的叔父杨希和，曾被高家庄贫雇在本报控诉他仗势欺人（见二月六日一版），此事发生可能与此有关，希该村工作组调查作正确处理。但不管如何，用刑罚是错误的。
