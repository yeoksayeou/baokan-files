  　Wu'an Pays Attention to Breaking Down Factionalism
    [Wu'an News] During the democratic rectification movement in Wu'an, it was found that factional sentiment was prevalent in villages in old and semi-old areas. In the semi-old areas, more than half of the fifteen villages exposed factional contradictions during the movement. At a mass meeting to review party members in Xima Village, the masses in Gouxi raised factional opinions, and comrades in Goudong retorted, whereupon more than a dozen women in Gouxi withdrew from the meeting, affecting the mood of the masses at the meeting. In Xia Tuan Cheng, during the process of class designation, when it came to designating Han Hongxu of the west end, the masses of the east end said that he "did not work and was a rich peasant." The masses in the west end said that he participated in labor and should be a middle peasant. The east end said that his fingernails were long and long, and that he had never been to the ground; the west end people said they had seen him farming with their own eyes. They adjourned the meeting without any conclusion. When the new farmers' association was established, each side wanted more of their own people, and casually pulled problematic people into the farmers' association. The work team proposed that the worst people should be purged, but the representatives brought up factionalism again, with each side saying that their own people were good and should not be purged. As a result, everyone who had to be purged was purged, and fifty or so people were purged all at once. At the mass review of party members in Gaocun, the people with the surname Hou did not offer opinions on the party members with the surname Hou, but offered many opinions on the party members with the surname Yang, and the people with the surname Yang retaliated against the party members with the surname Hou. In Xizhai Village, during last year's movement, the landlords used the factional contradictions between the east and west ends to buy off cadres to escape the struggle. In this movement, it was still discovered that old activists in the east and west ends were inciting the masses in each area to protect the landlords in each area. In Pian Shan, there was a serious factional contradiction between workers and peasants, and the masses in the east and west ends created factionalism again, hindering the movement from developing well. Overcoming these factional ideas, based on the experience of several villages in the semi-old areas, involves the following points: After the Gaocun work team arrived in the village, they conducted an in-depth understanding of the situation and discovered factional contradictions among the masses. In the movement, they further studied the historical roots of factional contradictions, so that the work team maintained a clear head, analyzed the opinions of the masses at any time, clarified which were factional retaliation opinions and which were correct opinions, enlightened the masses to democratic discussions, distinguished between right and wrong, promoted the opinions of upright people, and overcame factional ideas. And at the beginning of the work, a core leadership of upright poor peasants and hired farmhands was established, uniting a large number of upright poor peasants, hired farmhands, and middle peasants, and carrying out a democratic struggle against people with factional sentiments. Organizationally, the poor peasant groups and farmers' association groups were adjusted to break the old organizational forms based on lanes and areas. In Xima Village, class education was emphasized during the class designation and the organization of the new farmers' association, so that the masses realized that only by uniting could the peasants stand up. After education on organizing the new farmers' association, and after those with factional sentiment had made self-criticisms, they were allowed to join the association, and factional sentiment was overcome. The Rushan work team first conducted investigation and research to find out who the factional leaders were, and gradually mobilized the masses to isolate the factional leaders. Finally, when the new farmers' association was organized, a struggle was waged against the factional leaders at the conference, further exposing his plot to use factionalism to attack the masses and rule the masses, and dividing and winning over his factional clique, further isolating the factional leaders, which was of great educational significance to the masses.

　　民主整党运动中
  　武安注意打破宗派
    【武安消息】武安在民主整党运动中，发现在老区半老区村庄，普遍存在着宗派情绪。半老区共十五个村庄，就有一半以上村庄在运动中暴露了宗派矛盾。西马庄在群众审查党员大会上，沟西群众提出了宗派意见，沟东同志反驳回去，沟西十多个妇女即退出了会场，影响了大会群众情绪。下团城在划阶级中，划到西头韩红序时，东头群众说他“不劳动，就为富农”。西头群众说他参加劳动，应为中农。东头说他指甲长得长长的，那里下过地；西头人说亲眼看见他种地。也没划出一个结果来就散了会。成立新农会时，那头愿意叫那头人多些，把有毛病的人随便拉进了农会。工作组提出最坏的人要清洗，代表会又弄起宗派来，各片说各片人好，不应清洗。结果要清洗都得清洗，一下又清洗掉了五十多个人。高村在群众审查党员时，姓侯的群众不提姓侯的党员意见，对姓杨的党员提意见很多，姓杨的群众则对姓侯的党员提出报复意见。西寨子在去年运动中，地主利用东西头宗派矛盾，收买干部逃避了斗争。在这次运动中，仍发现东西头老积极分子有鼓动各片群众包庇各片地主现象。骈山则工农间存在着严重的宗派矛盾，东西头群众又弄片宗派，阻碍着运动不能很好发展。克服这些宗派思想，从半老区几个村的经验看来有如下几点：高村工作组到村后，即深入了解情况，发现了群众中宗派矛盾。在运动中并进一步研究了历史上宗派矛盾根源，使工作组保持了清醒的头脑，随时分析群众意见，弄清那些是宗派报复意见，那些是正确意见，启发群众民主讨论，分清是非，发扬了正派人的意见，克服了宗派思想。并在工作开始即树立了正派贫雇的核心领导，团结了大批的正派贫雇和中农，和有宗派情绪的人进行了民主斗争。在组织上，贫农小组和农会小组都加以调整，打破旧的按闾按片的组织形式。西马庄是在划阶级中及组织新农会中，强调进行阶级教育，使群众认识农民只有团结起来才能翻身。经过组织新农会的教育，并使有宗派情绪的人作了检讨，方许入会，宗派情绪克服下去。儒山工作组先作了调查研究，了解谁是宗派头子，逐渐发动群众来孤立宗派头子。最后在组织新农会时，在大会上向宗派头子进行了斗争，进一步揭发他利用宗派打击群众统治群众的阴谋，并分化争取其宗派小集团，更孤立了宗派头子，这对群众教育意义极大。
