Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 2nd: "Go to Dabie Mountain, join Liu and Deng's army, fight to Nanjing, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" This is the resounding slogan put forward by the liberated peasants in the old liberated areas when they joined the army. This batch of highly conscious and physically strong new soldiers has arrived at the Eyuwan front a few days ago. They are in very high spirits and mobilized the masses along the way. After arriving at the troops, everyone asked the veteran soldiers: How far is Dabie Mountain from Nanjing? Is Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing? They all hope that they can go to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. The PLA units warmly welcomed them. Zhu Jingyu, the squad leader of the Third Company of a certain unit, made a new hat for each new soldier in his squad with his own clothing material in order to welcome the new soldiers. The entire company of an engineering company of a certain unit organized a Yangko team to welcome the new soldiers. A detachment of the unit proposed to promote the fraternal friendship of the working class, unite new soldiers, and organize mutual assistance in physical strength, technology, and ideology. After the new soldiers arrived, the units held welcome meetings, forums, and entertainment parties to launch a new and old heart-to-heart movement. At the entertainment party of the Second Company of a certain unit to welcome new soldiers, a veteran soldier said: "You have all made a revolution in the old liberated areas and know a lot about politics. You must help us make political progress, and we must also help the new comrades well in military affairs." A new soldier also introduced his own experience of liberation, saying: "I only had three mu of land before. In the famine year, I borrowed food from the landlord, but the landlord refused to lend it to me. Two of my family of seven starved to death. Only after the land was distributed did I have food and clothing. The village elected me as a labor hero and a liberation hero. I thought: joining the army is more glorious than being a labor hero, so I joined the army. When I came to the newly liberated areas, I saw that the common people were still poor and the rich were rich. I thought, if we had come out earlier, I'm afraid this place would be the same as our old liberated areas. I will work hard and fight well in the future, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and let all the oppressed people in the world be liberated." The "Soldier's Newspaper" of a certain unit featured an editorial calling for "welcoming new soldiers with the attitude of class brothers," and asking new and veteran soldiers to help each other and learn from each other.

　　鄂豫皖迎接新战士
  　新老战士友爱团结如家人
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二日电】“到大别山去，参加刘邓大军，打到南京去，活捉蒋介石！”这是老解放区翻身农民参军时提出的响亮口号。这一批觉悟很高体格强健的新战士，已于日前到达鄂豫皖前线，他们情绪非常高涨，沿路发动群众，到部队后，大家都纷纷向老战士问询：大别山到南京有多远，蒋介石在不在南京，都希望自己能去南京活捉蒋介石。解放军各部则纷纷热烈欢迎。某部三连一班长朱景雨，为了迎接新战士，用他自己的衣服料子，给班里新战士每人做了一顶新帽子。某部工兵连全连组织秧歌队，欢迎新战士。该部一支队，提出发扬阶级兄弟的友爱，团结新战士，组织体力、技术、思想大互助。新战士到达后，各部队即分别召开迎新大会、座谈会、娱乐会，展开新老谈心运动。某部二连欢迎新战士的娱乐会上，一位老战士说：“你们都在老解放区闹过翻身，政治上懂得事情多，要帮助我们政治进步，在军事上我们也要很好的帮助新同志。”一位新战士亦介绍自己翻身的情形说：“我以前只有三亩地，灾荒年向地主借粮食，地主不借给，全家七口饿死了两口，分地后才有了吃穿。村里选我当劳动英雄、翻身英雄，我想：参军比当劳动英雄更光荣，我就参了军。来到新解放区，看到老百姓还是穷的穷富的富，我想我们要是早点出来，恐怕这个地方也和我们老解放区一样啦。我以后要好好工作，好好打仗，活捉蒋介石，叫天下受压迫的人都得到翻身。”某部“战士报”特写社论，号召以“阶级弟兄的态度迎接新战士”，要求新老战士互相帮助，互相学习。
