　　[Shahe News] After receiving the instruction of "whoever sows, reaps," the South Gao Village work group immediately held a general meeting to explain it to the masses. They explained it three times, but the masses still lacked enthusiasm for production. After inspection and discussion, it was discovered that some masses did not believe the instruction of "whoever sows, reaps" and were hesitant and indecisive. The leadership made further assurances to the masses. At the same time, after research by the poor peasant group, the farmers' association group, and the farmers' representative meeting, the 24 mu of wheat seedlings on the village's public land were temporarily lent to households who had just returned from fleeing and were not thoroughly turned over, and to middle peasant households who had been wrongly struggled, stabilizing their production. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses for production greatly increased. After a meeting in the evening, they watered the fields, hoed the wheat, and delivered manure the next day. It has now rained, and the masses are busy planting cotton. (Zheng Bingcai, Li Rong)
　　[Huguan News] In Xu Jiahou, Third District, in order to sow early, everything was planned and arranged in advance. Statistics show that out of the 1,300 mu of autumn land in the village, 780 mu have been fully fertilized, and 260 mu are prepared for applying night soil to plant corn, with the remaining barren land to be filled. An average of 80 loads of manure per mu were applied, striving to increase the yield of fine grains by 3.5 sheng per mu in the autumn. They are now actively repairing borders and building embankments, harrowing the land, digging small field paths, and combining it with coal transportation to prepare for burning fuel, overcoming the difficulties of being too busy during spring plowing and sowing in the past, and neglecting one thing for another.

　　南高工作组注意生产
  　安置错斗中农打破生产障碍
    【沙河消息】南高村工作组接到谁种谁收的指示后，就立刻召开大会，给群众讲解，共讲过三次，但群众生产劲仍不大，经过检查讨论，发现了有些群众对谁种谁收的指示不相信，弄的二心不定。领导上又给群众作了保证，同时还把村中的公地麦苗二十四亩，经过贫农小组、农会小组、农代会的研究，暂借给从外边逃难才回来的、翻身不透的户和斗错了的中农户，安定了他们的生产。这样一来，群众生产情绪大大的提高，晚上开了会，第二天就浇地锄麦子送粪。现在已下了雨，群众正忙着种棉花。　　　　　　　　　（郑炳才、李荣）
    【壶关消息】三区徐家后，为了提前下种，事先有计划把一切生活安排妥当，统计全村秋地一千三百亩，有七百八十亩已全部送到地粪了，二百六十亩准备担圊栽玉茭，下剩薰荒补齐。每亩平均上粪八十担，争取秋后每亩增产细粮三升半，现下正在积极修边垒堰，打耙地，刨地小道，结合驮煤炭，准备烧燃，克服过去春耕下种时忙上加忙，顾此失彼的困难。　　　　　（岱云）
