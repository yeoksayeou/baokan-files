Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 9th: A TASS correspondent in Delhi recently commented on the Indonesian situation, stating: For three months, the Netherlands, with the direct support of imperialists such as the United States, Britain, France, and Belgium, and the mediation committee, has greatly consolidated its position in Indonesia. Dutch aggressor troops now occupy almost two-thirds of Java, one-fifth of Sumatra, and all of Madura Island; they have seized rich plantations producing rubber, sugar cane, coffee, and other agricultural products, as well as rice paddies, and control the abundant resources of Sulawesi, Borneo, Belitung, Bangka, and other places. They force the people to work on farms with bayonets. Dutch imperialism is using sultans, regents, princes, and other descendants of feudal families in various places, appointing them to important positions in the Dutch-occupied areas. It maintains 120,000 to 130,000 troops in Indonesia, relying on various conspiracies, deceptions, and inciting ethnic conflicts among the people of various islands to maintain its rule. The Netherlands enjoys full and unlimited support from many imperialist countries, especially the United States. Ford, the US Consul General in Batavia, who recently engaged in fanatical conspiracy activities, was the conspirator who instigated the Dutch imperialists to launch an offensive against the Republic of Indonesia last July. He regularly reported to the US State Department that the Republic was "facing" a so-called "communist danger." Within the Republic of Indonesia, he received assistance from the Islamic Party and pro-American elements of the Kuomintang. The commentary continued to expose the US imperialist aggression in Indonesia, stating: American businessmen are flocking to Batavia, Bandung, and Palembang. Several US air force squadrons are stationed in Indonesia to conduct aerial surveys for measurement and geology, and are responsible for military and detailed surveys of Indonesian resources. Britain is also very active in Indonesia. In addition to distributing communiques and photographs to the people, the British consulate is also conducting anti-Soviet propaganda. The Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek) government and Belgium are, without exception, extremely hostile to the Indonesian people and maintain close contact with local reactionaries. The commentary concluded: The broad masses of the Indonesian people are increasingly hating the Dutch imperialists and their protectors. However, despite the anti-Soviet propaganda carried out by the imperialists, the Indonesian people still show warm sympathy for the Soviet Union, and Soviet citizens are welcomed everywhere. The Indonesian people call the Soviet Union "a friend of Indonesia." In bookstores in Yogyakarta, Solo, and other cities, Indonesian-language versions of Lenin's and Stalin's works and the Soviet Constitution are sold; Soviet films are also highly praised by the people.

　　印尼人民仇恨美荷
  　称苏联是他们的好朋友
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社德里记者顷评论印尼形势，略称：三个月来，荷兰在美英法比等帝国主义者和调停委员会的直接支持下，已大大巩固了它在印尼的地位。荷兰侵略军现在几乎占领了爪哇的三分之二，苏门答腊的五分之一，及全部马都拉岛的土地；攫夺了富饶的出产树胶、蔗糖、咖啡等农庄和稻田，控制着西里伯斯、婆罗洲、勿里洞、班加等地的丰富资源，并以刺刀逼迫人民在农场工作。荷兰帝国主义正利用各地苏丹、摄政者、王子及其他封建家族的后裔，委派他们在荷占区担任要职。它在印尼还保持了十二万至十三万名军队，凭借各种各样的阴谋、欺诈，并煽动各岛屿人民间的民族冲突，来维持他的统治。荷兰享受到许多帝国主义国家充分与无限制的支援，首先就是美国。不久前曾进行狂热阴谋活动的美驻巴总领事福特，就是去年七月间嗾使荷帝发动攻势反对印尼共和国的阴谋者。他经常向美国务院报告共和国“面临”所谓“共产主义危险”，在印尼共和国内部，他得到回教党及国民党亲美分子的帮助。评论继揭露美帝在印尼的侵略活动称：美国商人正云集于巴城、万隆及巨港等地。美国有几个空军中队驻在印尼，以进行测量与地质的空中勘察，并负有军事的与缜密勘察印尼资源的任务。英国在印尼也很活跃，英国领事馆除向人民分送公报与照片外，又进行反苏宣传。中国（蒋匪）政府及比利时亦毫无例外的极端仇视印尼人民，并与当地反动分子保持密切接触。评论最后称：印尼广大人民日益增长着对荷帝及其庇护者的憎恨。但是，尽管帝国主义进行的反苏宣传，印尼人民对苏联仍予以热烈同情，苏联公民到处受到欢迎。印尼人民称苏联为“印尼的朋友”，在日惹、梭罗及其他城市的书店里，出售印尼文版本的列宁、斯大林的名著和苏联宪法；苏联影片亦最为人民所称道。
