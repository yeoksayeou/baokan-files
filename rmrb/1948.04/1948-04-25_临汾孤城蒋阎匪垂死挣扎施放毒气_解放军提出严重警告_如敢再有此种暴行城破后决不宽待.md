Xinhua News Agency, Southern Shanxi Front, urgent telegram on the 22nd: The Chiang and Yan bandit troops besieged in the isolated city of Linfen actually released poison gas on one of our frontline positions last night. Some of our troops suffered poisoning and were vomiting incessantly. They have now recovered after treatment. This act of poison gas by the Chiang and Yan bandits was premeditated and prepared long ago. Recently, during our battle to capture the East Gate of Linfen, we seized the Yan bandit's 66th Division's Deputy Staff Officer's Telegraph No. 117, dated April 4, 37th year (1948), instructing subordinates to release poison gas. It forwarded a document issued by the Yan bandits entitled "Absolutely Essential Points for Attention When Releasing Poison Gas," which stated: "This agent is a type of poisonous liquid containing chlorine gas and is volatile, strong and potent, causing fear. Normally, at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius (such as in present-day tunnels and trenches), its toxicity can be maintained for more than six hours. It causes tearing, suffocation, vomiting, etc., in humans. At a concentration of one part per million (compared to air), it can cause incessant tearing. At a concentration of one part per 500,000, it can cause blindness in three to thirty seconds. At a concentration of one part in 80, it can cause suffocation and death within ten minutes." A spokesperson for the Southern Shanxi Front Headquarters has issued a serious warning to the Chiang and Yan bandit troops in Linfen regarding this matter: If the bandits dare to commit such atrocities that violate international law again, our army will take effective measures to deal with them, and the commanders of the Chiang and Yan bandit troops will be held responsible for all consequences. Furthermore, after the city falls, our army will severely punish the ringleaders of the poison gas attack and will show no leniency.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 23rd: On the morning of the 16th, our Southern Shanxi Front troops shot down an American-made Chiang aircraft over the Linfen battlefield. The aircraft was a "P"-47 type fighter, serial number 431, which landed on the bank of the Fen River west of Hongdong city and was captured by us. The pilot, Second Lieutenant Wei Huang, a squadron leader of the 43rd Squadron of the 11th Aviation Group, was injured during the landing and has been sent to our army's field hospital for treatment.

　　临汾孤城蒋阎匪垂死挣扎施放毒气
    解放军提出严重警告
    如敢再有此种暴行城破后决不宽待
    【新华社晋南前线二十二日急电】困踞临汾孤城之蒋阎匪军，昨晚竟到我前线某阵地施放毒气，我军一部中毒、呕吐不已，经救治后现已痊愈。蒋阎匪此次放毒暴行，乃系蓄意已久早有准备者，最近我攻占临汾东关战斗中，即曾缴获阎匪六十六师三十七年四月四日饬令部属施放毒气之副参字第一一七号代电，转发阎匪所发“放毒绝应注意点”一文件，中称：“本剂系一种有氯气且带挥发性之毒液体、性强力猛，令人畏惧，普通在摄氏表二十度以下时（如现时之地道暗壕内）其毒性可保持六小时以上，对于人类有催泪窒息呕吐等性，在百万分之一时（与空气作比）可使人流泪不止，在五十万分之一时，在三秒至三十秒的时间可使人瞎眼，在八十分之一时，十分钟内可令人窒息而死。”晋南前线指挥部发言人，顷就此对临汾蒋阎匪军提出严重警告：如匪等胆敢再有此种违反国际公法之暴行，本军决将采取有效手段对付，其一切后果应由蒋阎匪军指挥官负责，并且城破之后，我军决将放毒之首犯严加惩办，定不宽贷。
