　　Neiqiu Distributes Grain, Funds, Bran, and Vegetables
  　Solving the Spring Famine and Promoting Production
    [Neiqiu News] The Neiqiu County Production Committee, on April 3rd, distributed 181,400 jin of grain as loans (including 100,640 jin of interest-free grain loans), 57.5 million yuan in loans, and bran and vegetables provided as relief from Xingtai to the disaster-stricken people throughout the county. According to an imprecise investigation by the Neiqiu County Production Committee, out of the county's 240 administrative villages, more than 25,000 households and 104,000 people, over 1,200 households and 4,700 people were already without food (at the end of March), and this number was expected to increase by the wheat harvest. The main form of relief was to organize disaster-stricken people to engage in production for self-salvation. In terms of relief methods, priority was given to impoverished peasants and hired laborers who had not yet turned themselves around, while also not neglecting middle peasants who currently lacked food, as well as other classes willing to engage in production, to prevent starvation. At the same time, the past phenomena of being afraid of not being able to repay loans and thus not lending grain or funds, and of restricting what could be purchased with the loan, had to be overcome. More bran, vegetables, and interest-free grain loans were to be given to disaster-stricken people without labor, as bran and vegetables did not need to be returned. For landlords and rich peasants who had been struggled against and were currently suffering from the disaster, the previously stipulated unpaid labor was first to be canceled, and they were to be urged to organize production to solve their own livelihood difficulties. In addition, to facilitate the masses' access to loans, the Production Committee decided that the bank would send cadres with funds to the district offices in villages far from the bank for distribution, so as not to delay the masses' production.

　　内邱发放粮款糠菜
  　解决春荒推动生产
    【内邱消息】内邱县生产委员会，于四月三日，以贷粮十八万一千四百斤（内有无利贷粮十万零六千四百斤），贷款五千七百五十万元，及邢台救济的糠菜，发给全县灾民。内邱春荒据县生产委员会不精确的调查，全县二百四十个行政村，二万五千余户，十万四千余口人，现下没吃的（三月底）已有了一千二百余户，四千七百多人，到麦收时还要增加，救济主要是组织灾民生产自救。在救济的方法上，先满足未翻透身的贫雇农民，也不忽视现时没吃的中农，及愿意生产的其他阶层，防止有饿死人的现象。同时要克服过去怕还不起不贷给粮款，及贷什么款只能买什么东西的现象。无劳力灾民要多发糠菜及无利的贷粮，因糠菜不归还。对斗过的地主富农，当下受灾荒者，首先取消过去规定的无代价劳动，督促组织他们生产，解决他们自己生活的困难。另外为了群众贷款方便，生产委员会又决定离银行远的村子，银行派干部携款到区公所发放，以免群众耽误生产。
