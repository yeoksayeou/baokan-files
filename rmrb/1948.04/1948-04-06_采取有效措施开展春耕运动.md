　　Take Effective Measures
  　To Launch the Spring Ploughing Campaign
    Various regions of the Border Area are paying attention to breaking the ideological opposition between land reform and production, and are now taking various effective measures to promote spring ploughing work. In order to unify the leadership of spring ploughing, many counties in Taihang, Taiyue, and Jinnan have successively established production leadership organizations to lead mass production under a unified pace. The She County County Committee and County Government organized production inspection teams to go to the countryside, and Shahe also promptly changed the production propaganda team into a production work team, which went to various districts to lead and organize the masses for spring ploughing. This practice is worth promoting more universally in various places to launch a spring ploughing campaign that is more enthusiastic than in previous years.
    According to Shahe's materials, the promotion of party rectification and democracy and filling villages only accounts for less than one-eighth of the villages in the county; in Zuoquan, only two villages in each of the seven districts are implementing land reform, and the situation in other counties is roughly similar; moreover, several counties are key production counties, and the entire county is focused on production. This shows how important it is for our region to create a mass movement of enthusiastic production. Neglecting production leadership will cause irreparable losses. Facts from various places prove that spring ploughing production is the urgent demand of the masses, especially in areas that suffered disasters last year, the masses are even more urgently demanding production and hope that the leadership can help them find ways to produce and solve the current difficulties in eating and drinking. If the leaders in various places take effective measures based on local conditions, a mass spring ploughing production movement will be rapidly formed. At present, spring ploughing production in some places still appears scattered and laissez-faire. Some people attribute the reason to the fact that village cadres and the masses are affected by land reform, their ideological emotions are unstable, and production is not easy to promote. This statement is one-sided. The main thing should be said that the leadership lacks a firm and clear policy on production and lacks the allocation of a certain amount of power to carry out strong and specific promotion. Some cadres underestimate leading the masses in production. For example, some comrades in the Shahe production work team believe that the production work team is not as important as the land reform work team, and it is wrong to underestimate their tasks. We hope that all localities attach importance to the leadership of production, allocate sufficient forces, promote the spring ploughing movement, and be able to discover and solve problems at any time in the movement, and promptly correct all activities and deviations that hinder spring ploughing production, such as a small number of bad elements infringing on the interests of middle peasants in the name of poor peasants and hired laborers, forcing the organization of mutual aid, wasting people's power, etc., should be corrected immediately upon discovery, so that the movement can achieve normal development.
    Qingming has passed, we hope that all localities will quickly take various effective measures to enthusiastically launch the spring ploughing campaign!

### 采取有效措施开展春耕运动

　　采取有效措施
  　开展春耕运动
    边区各地注意打破土改与生产对立思想，现正采各种有效措施推进春耕工作。为统一春耕领导，太行、太岳、冀南不少县份，现已陆续建立生产领导机构，在统一步调下，领导群众生产。涉县县委和县府组织了生产检查队下乡，沙河也及时将生产宣传队改成为生产工作队，分赴各区领导组织群众春耕。这种作法，值得在各地更普遍的推行起来，开展一个较往年更热烈的春耕运动。
    据沙河材料，推进整党民主与填补村庄只占全县村庄八分之一弱；左权七个区，每区只两个村推行土改，其他县情况大体类此；且有若干县为生产重点县，全县都在以生产为主。这说明，我区把生产造成群众性的热烈运动是何等重要的事情，忽视生产领导，则将造成不可补偿的损失。从各地事实证明：春耕生产是群众的迫切要求，特别在去年遭受灾荒地区，群众更迫切要求生产，希望领导上能帮助他们找寻生产门路，解决目前吃喝困难，如果各地领导上根据当地情况，采取有效措施，群众性的春耕生产运动是会迅速形成的。目前若干地方，春耕生产仍表现散漫自流，有些人把原因归之于村干与群众受土改影响，思想情绪不稳定，生产不易推动，这种说法是有片面性的，主要应该说是领导上对生产缺乏坚定明确的方针，缺乏配备一定力量进行有力的具体的推动。有一部分干部，轻视领导群众生产，如沙河生产工作队有些同志，认为生产工作队不如土改工作队重要，轻视自己任务是错误的。我们希望各地重视生产的领导，配备足够力量，把春耕运动推动起来，并能在运动中随时发现问题，解决问题，并及时纠正一切妨碍春耕生产的活动与偏向，如少数坏分子假借贫雇名义侵害中农利益，强迫组织互助，浪费民力等等，应该发现了即纠正，使运动获得正常的发展。
    清明已过，望各地迅即采取各种有效措施，把春耕运动热烈的搞起来！
