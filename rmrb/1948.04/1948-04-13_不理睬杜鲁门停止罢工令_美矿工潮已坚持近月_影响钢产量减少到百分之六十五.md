Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: New York dispatch: The nationwide strike of 400,000 miners, which has lasted for more than 20 days, is, according to a US Associated Press dispatch of the 4th, "having an increasingly large impact on industry, like a rolling snowball." Steel production is continuing to decline sharply, and on the 5th had fallen to 65 percent of its capacity. The largest steel trust in the United States, "United States Steel Corporation," lamented that "the production plan for next week is still impossible to predict." The automobile industry's production volume for this month is in dire straits. The volume of transportation has also dropped to the lowest level this year. Wall Street's minion Truman is extremely panicked by this and on the 3rd took fascist measures, personally ordering Attorney General Clark to cite the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law to order the miners to end the strike. However, according to a United Press International dispatch of the 5th, the president of the Miners Union, Lewis, ignored this. Currently, the miners' strike is still ongoing, not only "without any sign of resuming work," but has also spread to eastern Pennsylvania. On the 6th, 6,000 miners in the area held a strike to show their support.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: TASS, New York dispatch: The Wallace for President Committee of New York State was formally established on the 3rd of this month. Representatives of the Wallace for President Committee from many cities and rural areas of the state, numbering 1,000 people, attended. Wallace delivered a speech at the meeting, stating: "In the past three weeks, due to Truman's various reactionary measures, the peace camp supporting Wallace has increased by hundreds of thousands of people." He called on the meeting to continue to win over the broad masses of people to join the front. He said: "We must fully absorb all those who are wholeheartedly and enthusiastically committed to achieving peaceful understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union." Labor Party Congressman Marcantonio, speaking at the meeting, emphasized that the current Wallace for President movement has become a "peace resistance movement," which is an effective anti-war force in the United States. Mr. Ma urged the representatives to carry out the struggle for peace in factories and communities when establishing the Wallace campaign organization.

　　不理睬杜鲁门停止罢工令
  　美矿工潮已坚持近月
  　影响钢产量减少到百分之六十五
    【新华社陕北九日电】纽约讯：坚持已达二十余日的四十万矿工全国性大罢工，据美联社四日电说：“他对工业的影响，象滚雪球一样越来越大。”钢产量正继续大减，五日已减至其生产力的百分之六十五。美国最大的钢托拉斯“美国钢铁公司”悲鸣“下周的生产计划，至今仍无从预定。”汽车工业本月份的生产量岌岌可危。运输业载运量也降至今年的最低数。华尔街的从仆杜鲁门对此十分恐慌，竟于三日采取法西斯手段，亲自命令司法部长克拉克引用塔虎脱——哈特莱反劳工法，勒令矿工停止罢工。但据合众社五日电息，矿工联合会主席路易斯对此不加理睬。目前矿工罢工仍在坚持中，不仅“无任何复工的象征”，且已波及宾州东部，六日该地六千矿工特举行罢工以示声援。
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社纽约讯：纽约州华莱士竞选总统委员会已于本月三日正式成立，到有该州很多城市与乡村地区华氏竞选总统委员会之代表一千人。华莱士在会上发表演说称：“过去三周，由于杜鲁门的种种反动措施，使拥护华莱士的和平阵营增加了好几十万人”。他号召会议继续争取广大人民加入该阵线。他说：“凡一切全心全意热诚致力于达到美苏和平谅解的人们，我们都必须全部吸收。”美劳工党议员马肯托尼奥在会上演说时，着重指出：目前华莱士竞选总统运动，已成为“和平抵抗运动了”，这是美国国内一支有效的反战的力量。马氏敦促代表们在建立华莱士竞选机构时，要在工厂与社区里进行争取和平的斗争。
