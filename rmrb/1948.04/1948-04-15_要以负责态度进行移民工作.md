　　To Conduct Immigration Work with a Responsible Attitude
Editor：
　　The immigration work in Wu'an has begun successively. For example, the representatives of immigrants from fifteen villages in the seventh district went to the eighth district on April 6th to make contact and see the houses and land in various villages. The district and village cadres provided assistance, which is certainly very good. However, there are still some issues that deserve attention:
　　First, there is a lack of patience in mobilizing and educating the masses in the receiving villages. They view the immigrants differently, which affects the smooth progress of the immigration work. For example, the villages of Xiaohe Village, Dongwannian, and Sanwen Village in the eighth district showed a negative attitude towards the immigrants. They showed the representatives dilapidated houses and remote land. Xiaohe Village told the representatives, "Our village has low yields and heavy burdens, with more than one stone of public grain per mu (actually, the last burden was only nine jin of rice per mu)." When the representatives went to see a house in Dongwannian, the homeowner was unhappy and refused to let the representatives sit on the chairs, taking them away to chop firewood. All of this is wrong. The representatives were very dissatisfied, and some said, "They treat us as outsiders; it's better not to come." As a result, six households in Dashui＠jiao didn't want to come. Only after the district explained and guaranteed things did some of the knots get untied.
　　On the other hand, the education and mobilization of immigrant households are also insufficient, and the immigrants have excessively high demands. For example, they demand new houses, nearby land, wheat fields, and want to harvest grain in May. The border government bulletin clearly stipulates that whoever plants it harvests it, but they want the crops already planted, which is wrong. According to them, it may be that the cadres, in order to complete the immigration task quickly, promised overly high conditions, saying that moving here would be all good and without any difficulties, so everyone had high expectations. But as soon as they arrived, they were somewhat disappointed. We believe that this method of mobilization is inappropriate. It is not a simple matter for the masses to leave their hometowns and move elsewhere. We hope that the cadres doing this work should, with a responsible attitude towards the people, patiently mobilize both the sending and receiving masses and handle matters concretely.

### 要以负责态度进行移民工作

　　要以负责态度进行移民工作编辑同志：
    武安的移民工作，已先后开始。如七区十五个村移民代表，于四月六日到八区接头，到各村去看房、地，区村干部都给以帮助，这当然很好，但还有些问题值得注意：
    一是不耐心动员教育接受移民村的群众，他们另眼看待移民，影响移民工作的顺利进行，如八区小贺庄、东万年、三温村，对待移民就表示不好，叫代表看房子看坏的，看地看远的，小贺庄告代表说：“俺村产量不大，负担不小，一亩地出一石多公粮（其实上次负担每亩才出九斤米）。”代表到东万年一家去看房子，房主不高兴，有椅也不让代表坐，拿去劈柴烧。这都是不对的。代表们很不满意，有的说：“人家要当外来户看咱，就不如不来。”因此大水＠蛟就有六户不想来了。经过区上解释与保证，才解开些圪塔。
    另一方面是对移民户的教育动员也不够，移民户要求过高。如要求新房、近地，要麦地，五月就想得籽。明明边府布告上规定谁种谁收，他想要人家种的现成的，这是不对的。据他们谈，可能是干部动员时，为了急于完成移民任务，承许条件太高，说移下来千好万好，毫无困难，大家希望很高；但一下来就有些失望，我们认为这种动员方法是不妥当的。群众离乡外移，是个不简单的事，我们希望作这一工作的干部，应以对人民负责的态度，在移出移入双方群众中，都要耐心动员，具体处理才好。　　　　（柴任平、杨秀华、靳广善）
