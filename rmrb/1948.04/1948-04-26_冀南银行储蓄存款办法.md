    Jinan Bank Savings Deposit Regulations
    1. This service is specifically for savings by personnel from government organizations, military units, cadres, staff, and employees of public and private enterprises. For convenience, only current savings deposits are offered.
    2. Term: Monthly deposits and withdrawals are limited to one or two times. If deposits are interrupted for more than two months, they will be treated as ordinary deposits. Savings terms are divided into three types: three months or more, six months or more, and one year. Once determined, they cannot be modified.
    3. Interest Rate: Savings deposits are compounded monthly. The provisional monthly interest rate is 3% for deposits exceeding one month, 3.5% for deposits exceeding three months, 4% for deposits exceeding six months, and 4.5% for deposits exceeding one year.
    4. Procedures: Once a savings deposit account is opened, the bank will issue a savings deposit book. Subsequent deposits and withdrawals will be made with the book. If the book is lost, the bank should be notified immediately to report the loss. The bank is not responsible for any fraudulent withdrawals before the loss is reported.
    5. Amount: The minimum deposit amount for each transaction is 1,000 yuan, up to a maximum of 100,000 yuan. For cadres and staff of government organizations and military units, deposits exceeding 100,000 yuan upon opening an account should be accompanied by a certificate from the competent authority and responsible personnel. During the savings period, the remaining balance after each withdrawal must not be less than 50% of the total deposit amount.
