　　Dongyu Village Disregards the Calendar
  　Completes Cotton Planting by the Mu
    [Taihang News] Dongyu Village, She County, under the slogan "Don't wait for the calendar, plant cotton by the mu," completed the planting of all 398 mu of cotton fields by the beginning of April. Since the village cadres of Dongyu Village, She County, returned from the county's production mobilization meeting, they have been very active in their work. After a rainfall, they convened a meeting of all work team leaders on the night of March 30th. The political director said at the meeting: "Last year, we waited for the calendar, and because of the drought, we didn't plant all the cotton. Later, when it rained, it was too late to plant, and the cotton bolls that were planted didn't open in the autumn, so we had great difficulty in wearing cotton clothes in the winter. This year, we must learn from last year's experience, don't wait for the calendar, plant early by the mu, get up early if you can, don't miss the opportunity." The team leaders all agreed with his opinion, and then discussed a plan for the whole village to plant 160 mu of cotton fields, with each person planting one fen. Later, during discussions in each team, everyone knew the benefits of planting cotton and were willing to plant more, resulting in an increase to 192 mu, averaging nearly two fen per person.

　　东宇庄不等节令
  　趁垧种完棉花
    【太行消息】涉县东宇庄，在“不要等节令，趁垧种棉花”的口号下，三百九十八亩棉花地，于四月初全部下种。涉县东宇庄村干部自从县开生产动员会回来，工作上很积极，天下过雨后，即于三月卅日夜召开全村拨工队长会，政治主任在会上说：“去年光等节令，因天旱棉花没全种上，后来有了雨想种已经迟了，种上的棉花桃秋天也没崩开，所以咱们冬天穿棉衣有了很大困难。今年可要接受去年经验，不要等节令，趁垧早种，能叫起早，不叫误了”。各队长都很同意他的意见，便讨论全村每人以一分棉花地计划共一百六十亩，后在各队中讨论时，大家都知道种棉花的好处都愿多种，结果增到一百九十二亩，每口平均近二分。
