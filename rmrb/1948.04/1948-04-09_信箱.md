　　Comrade Yue Shoushan of Xida City: Your problem has been forwarded to the Xida City work group for investigation and handling.
　　Comrade Xu Buchang of the Fourth District of Ci County: Your problem has been sent to the Political Department of the Fifth Sub-district for examination and handling. In the future, we hope that you will adhere to principles when handling problems in your work. In the future, no matter who distributes food in the village, they must hand in rice tickets. If there are no rice tickets, there must be formal procedures. Do not be careless, so as not to cause losses to the masses.
　　Comrade Xiao Song: Regarding the problem you raised in our newspaper on March 16th about a kiln worker in En County being oppressed by the kiln owner and filing a lawsuit in the En County Judicial Section, which has been unresolved for a year and a half, the En County Judicial Section has conducted an investigation and stated that it did not accept the case. If the problem has not been resolved, you can file a complaint with the County Judicial Section.
　　Comrade Shi Ming: The complete formulation of "poor and hired peasants running the house" should be: with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, unite with middle peasants to run the house together. This formulation does not conflict with "all power belongs to the peasant representative assembly."
　　Comrades Wang Zemin, Shi Mingxian, and Fan Zhongfu: The child born after Shi E and Zhao Liangshun lived together should be considered Zhao Liangshun's child and should be allocated land together with Zhao. As for Shi E, regardless of how the marriage problem is resolved, she should be allocated a share of land and property for herself. Her original husband has been missing for five years, and according to government regulations, she can remarry. The relationship between her and Zhao Liangshun can be legalized through certain procedures with the consent of both parties.
　　Comrade Shoujing of Neiqiu, forwarding to Comrade Yin Xingrong: If your original unit has not yet gone south, you can find the unit to resolve the problem; otherwise, you can find a hospital introduced by the military region for treatment.
　　Comrade Zhang Sigong: Regarding your doubts about several points in Comrade Ren Bishi's "Several Issues in Land Reform," you should carefully understand the spirit of the document. Several points are certain: First, if the land occupied by a farmer does not exceed more than one time the average owned by a general middle peasant, and the exploitation does not exceed 25 percent of the total income, then he is not a rich peasant but a well-to-do middle peasant. The well-to-do middle peasant is part of the middle peasant and should be protected. Second, the Poor Peasants League does not allow middle peasants to participate (new middle peasants can be absorbed), which does not mean isolating the middle peasants. The Poor Peasants League is originally an organization of poor peasants, so naturally, it cannot absorb middle peasants to participate. Unity with the middle peasants is manifested organizationally by forming peasant associations with poor and hired peasants as the backbone to unite with middle peasants, and establishing peasant representative assemblies in some larger villages. The Poor Peasants League, peasant associations, and peasant representative assemblies are the legal bodies for implementing land reform. As for whether landlords and former rich peasants who have fallen to become poor peasants, hired peasants, or middle peasants should participate in the Poor Peasants League and peasant associations, this should be reviewed and decided separately by the Poor Peasants League or peasant associations, which does not hinder unity with the middle peasants.
　　The Third District Public Office of Licheng: The questions raised have been submitted to the Political Department of the Military Region for examination and handling.

    西达城岳寿山同志：你的问题已转交西达城工作团调查处理。
    磁县四区许步昌同志：你们的问题已寄交五分区政治部检查处理。以后希望你在工作中处理问题一定要坚持原则。以后不论什么人在村里派饭，必须交米票，没有米票时也一定得有正式手续，决不可马虎，以免使群众吃亏。
    嚣松同志：本报三月十六日刊载你提出的恩县一窑工受窑主压迫，在恩县司法科告了状，一年半没下落的问题，恩县司法科已经做了检查，说并未受理此案。问题若还未解决，可向该县司法科提出控告。
    史明同志：“贫雇当家”的完整提法应该是：以贫雇为骨干团结中农一块当家，这样提和“一切权力归农代会”并不冲突。
    王泽民、史明贤、范中富同志：史娥的和赵良顺伙过后生的孩子应该算做赵良顺的孩子，和赵一块分地。至于史娥的不管婚姻问题如何解决，都应分给她自己一份土地财产。她原来丈夫没消息已经五年，按政府法令她可以另行结婚。她和赵良顺的关系，在双方自愿的情况下可以经过一定手续取得合法地位。
    内邱守敬同志转尹兴荣同志：假使你原来部队尚未南下，可找部队解决；否则找军区介绍医院治疗也可。
    张思恭同志：你对任弼时同志的“土地改革中的几个问题”中的几点疑问，应该再仔细体会文件精神，有几点是肯定的：一、如果农民所占有的土地不超过一般中农平均所有一倍以上，剥削不超过总收入百分之二十五，则不是富农而是富裕中农，富裕中农是中农的一部分，应受保护。二、贫农团不让中农参加（新中农可以吸收），并不是孤立中农，贫农团原就是贫农的组织，自然不能吸收中农参加。团结中农表现在组织上，是以贫雇为骨干联合中农组成农会，并在一些较大村庄建立农代会，贫农团农会农代会就是执行土改的合法办事机关。至于地主旧富农下降成为贫农雇农或中农的，是否参加贫农团农会，应由贫农团或农会加以审查分别决定，这也不妨碍团结中农。
    黎城第三区区公所：所提问题已交军区政治部检查处理。
