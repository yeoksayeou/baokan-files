    Solving Cadre Fear of Making Mistakes
    Xiangyuan Villages Rectify Mutual Aid; Li Yuzhu of Dalinkou Said: "It's already bad enough I did bad things before, now if I lie down and do nothing, I'll be even more letting the masses down."
    [Our News] According to a report in the "Farmers' Newspaper" of Taihang Xiangyuan, many villages in Xiangyuan are rectifying mutual aid organizations and strengthening leadership in spring plowing production. Some achievements have already been made, and problems existing in production have been discovered. Some have been resolved, and others are being addressed. The main reason why spring plowing in Chengguan Nanmen Street was not vigorous was that the cadres did not organize the masses, and the difficulties of the poor peasants and hired laborers were not resolved. Generally, cadres were timid and did not dare to lead. For example, Wang Chengfu, the political director, said, "Now work emphasizes democracy, and we can't do everything for them. Being a cadre is not as good as being a farmer, how can we lead production?" Li Shicheng, the deputy street chief, was afraid of making mistakes and took a perfunctory attitude towards his work. Therefore, production fell into drift. Then, after examining this attitude, everyone finally agreed that if there are mistakes, they must be thoroughly reviewed and reflected upon. We must reform ourselves in production. It is wrong to be afraid of making mistakes and not dare to lead. After correcting their thinking, they immediately checked which households had difficulties and how to solve them. They found that eight poor peasant and hired laborer households had no food or drink, and nine poor peasant and hired laborer households had no furniture. After discussion in the night school, it was decided to temporarily borrow three dan and eight dou of grain from the fruit grain and distribute it to them, and the cooperative iron shop would subsidize the furniture at a reduced price. Based on the principle of voluntary cooperation, eight groups were organized (two of which were formed last year and were not touched), organizing 47 laborers. In eight days, they repaired 152 mu of land and harrowed 54 mu of land. The masses in Northeast Yang held a meeting at the night school to review the many problems in last year's mutual aid: the organization was not based on voluntary grouping, accounts were not settled in a timely manner, and long-term laborers did not get paid. Yan Anzhuang in Wei Heihais's group still owed six dou of wages from last year. Wang Huaizhou and Wang Yutang in Gao Haizhou's group still hadn't settled the ox feed. In some groups, there were many adults eating together, and small households couldn't afford it. Wang Shizhu, a poor peasant, had a family of three. Once, the mutual aid group sent six people to his house, and his pot was too small to feed them all, so he had to borrow from his neighbors. One meal for them was like several days for his family. In response to these problems, they discussed how to conduct production this year. The result of the discussion was to allow everyone to freely form groups, breaking the past form of grouping, regardless of size, and cadres personally joining the groups. After five days of deliberation and communication, a total of 24 groups were organized, including 168 households, 142 laborers, and 52 animals. The town of Xialiang specifically discussed the organization of spring plowing. After seven days of deliberation and three night school discussions, the mutual aid group was established. The first night was to resolve ideological concerns and then voluntarily form groups, whether three people in a group or five people in a group, but the result was that the elderly and widowed households were isolated. The second night, they reviewed past mutual aid, discovered problems and specific solutions, and finally asked whether it was right to leave out the elderly and widowed households, letting everyone consider it. The third night was the final rectification, absorbing poor and labor-free households to participate (Editor's note: The result of the first night's voluntary grouping was that the elderly and widowed households were isolated. In the end, it was asked whether it was right to leave out the elderly and widowed households, and then they were absorbed to participate. This may not necessarily be in line with the principle of voluntariness. It is a fact that the elderly and widowed households have difficulties and should be taken care of and ways to solve them should be found. Elderly and widowed households with labor can exchange labor with households with labor. Those without labor can find other ways to provide relief. It is not right to force these households into the groups. This is not in line with the principle of voluntariness, and as a result, mutual aid cannot be consolidated.) Many people also freely jumped groups. A total of 50 groups were reorganized in the village, with 316 participants. Thirty-three textile groups were also organized, with 302 participants. They are now moving.
    [Zuoquan News] Cadres in Sucheng Village in the Seventh District and Dalinkou Village in the Fourth District of this county actively led the masses in spring plowing production and achieved remarkable results. Li Yao, the former director of the Farmers' Association in Sucheng Village, solved his own problems after party rectification and was now elected as the production director, working very actively. In the past five days, he has led the masses to deliver manure to 3,000 mu, planted 59 mu of grain, 7.5 mu of corn, 15.7 mu of cotton, 64.7 mu of hemp, 122 mu of yams, and 7 mu of pumpkins and watermelons. Delivering hemp earned 653,000 yuan, and digging Xiangli roots earned 800,000 yuan, solving the masses' difficulties in changing seasons in the spring. The cadres of Dalinkou Village have not slackened in leading the masses in production this spring. Li Yuzhu, the former public security director (now re-elected as production committee member and volunteer teacher), said: "I did bad things in front of the masses before. If I lie down and do nothing now, I will be even more letting the masses down." Village head Dong Qingsheng said, "Our village hasn't been evenly distributed yet. It's no good just waiting. As long as I'm in office, I have to do things for the masses every day! The newspaper said that lying down and doing nothing is making a mistake on top of a mistake." Li Yuzhu actively led the masses to cut strips in the first month, earning 650,000 yuan, solving the masses' grain problem for three months. When delivering manure, the masses were afraid to deliver it, so the village cadres delivered it first. Those with donkeys used donkeys, and those without donkeys carried it by hand. Only then did the masses break their concerns. On April 5th, the newspaper published an article urging people to sow seeds quickly. The village cadres read it aloud in the night school while mobilizing everyone to plant seeds. At this time, some people thought it was still early and shouldn't plant seeds, so the village head took the lead in planting three mu of grain and eight fen of yams. In the evening, he used the experience of "early planting gains, late planting suffers" to explain to the masses during class time. In particular, he cited Li Fuyou last year, who caught the seedlings early. When there was a drought, others watered and replanted, but Fuyou didn't miss this work, and the seedlings grew very well. In the autumn, his harvest was heavier than others. Late rice was 15 jin of millet per dou, while Fuyou's was 17 jin of millet per dou. This example was used to illustrate the great difference between early planting and late planting, convincing the masses. The next day, the masses all moved. In ten days, the whole village planted 52 mu of potatoes, 27 mu of cotton, and 278 mu of grain. The number of mu planted accounted for half of the village's total land. The grain has been planted, and they are now repairing the cornfields. (Bao Jiang, Shi Min)

    解决干部怕犯错误思想
    襄垣各村整顿互助  大林口李玉珠说：“以前办下坏事，现在躺倒不干，更对不起群众。”
    【本报消息】根据太行襄垣“农民报”报导，襄垣不少村庄正在整顿互助组织，加强春耕生产领导，并已获得一些成绩，发现生产中存在的问题，有的已得到解决，有的正在设法解决。城关南门街检查春耕不起劲的主要原因是干部没有去组织群众，贫雇困难没有解决，一般干部束手束脚，不敢领导。如政治主任王成富说：“现在工作是讲民主，不能包办代替，当干部不如一个农民，怎样去领导生产？”副街长李石成，怕犯错误，工作是应付态度。因此生产陷于自流。接着检查这种态度，最后大家认为有了错误就得好好检讨，好好反省，在生产中改造自己，怕犯错误不敢领导是不对的。思想扭过来后，即检查谁家有困难，怎样解决，发现有八户贫雇无吃喝，九户贫雇没家具用，又经过夜校讨论，没吃的由果实粮内暂借粮食三石八斗分给他们，没家具的由合作社铁铺减价补助。在自愿合心的原则下，组织了八个小组（内有两个小组去年组成的，没有动），组织起劳力四十七名。八天内修地一百五十二亩，耙地五十四亩。东北阳群众夜校开会检讨出来去年互助当中有许多毛病：组织时不是自愿碰组，没有随时结算帐目，长工的得不上钱，魏黑孩组内的阎安庄去年欠的工资米六斗，现在还没有出。高海周组内的王怀周、王玉堂牛晌米至今还没算清。有的组大人多互助吃饭，小户人家受不了。贫农王石柱家三口人，有一次互助组拨去六个人，家里锅小不够吃，还得东西邻家去借，吃他一顿，顶他家吃好几天。针对这些问题，讨论今年生产如何进行。讨论结果，让大家自由碰组，打破过去编组形式，大小不拘，干部亲自入组。经过五天的酝酿串通，共组织起来二十四个组，包括一百六十八户，劳力一百四十二名，牲口五十二头。下良镇专门讨论了春耕的组织问题，前后经过七天的酝酿，三个夜校的讨论，才把互助组搞起来。第一夜是解决思想顾虑后自愿碰组，三人一组也好，五人一组也行，但结果把孤寡户孤立起来。第二夜检讨过去互助，发现问题和具体解决办法，最后提出不要孤寡户对不对？让大家考虑。第三夜最后整顿，吸收了贫苦无劳力户参加（编者按：头一夜自愿碰组结果，孤寡户孤立起来，最后提出不要孤寡户对不对，又吸收他们参加了。这里不一定符合自愿原则，孤寡户有困难是事实，应该照顾，设法解决，有劳力的孤寡户，可以和有劳力户变工，没劳力的想其他办法救济，不能硬把这些户往组里塞。这是不合自愿原则，结果互助还是不能巩固。）也有许多人自由跳了组。全村共重新组织了五十个组，参加人数三百一十六人。纺织组也组织了三十三个，有三百零二人参加。现已动弹起来。
    【左权消息】本县七区粟城与四区大林口二村干部积极领导群众春耕生产，获得显著成绩。粟城村前任农会主任李瑶经过整党，解决了自己的问题，现被选为生产主任，工作很积极。最近五天内，已领导群众送粪三千亩，种谷五十九亩，种玉茭七亩半，棉花十五亩七，大麻六十四亩七，山药一百二十二亩，南瓜、西瓜七亩。送麻赚洋六十五万三千元，刨香藜根赚洋八十万元，解决了群众春天换季困难。大林口村干部，在今春领导群众生产中也没有松懈。前任公安主任（现又被选生产委员和义教）李玉珠说：“以前咱在群众面前坏事也办下了，这时你躺倒不干，那就更对不起群众。”村长董庆生说：“咱村现在还没平分，死等也是不行，在职一天就要给群众办一天事哩！报上说，躺倒不干是错上加错。”李玉珠在正月就积极领导过群众割条，赚洋六十五万元，解决了群众三个月的粮食。送粪时，群众不敢送，村干部就先送，有驴的用驴，没驴人担，群众这才打破顾虑。四月五号，报上登出赶快下种的稿子，村干部在夜校里一面念，一面动员大家滴籽。这时有些人认为还早，不该下种，村长便领头种谷三亩，栽山药八分。晚上又在上课时间用“早种沾光，晚种背伤”的经验给群众作解释。特别举出去年李富有，早种捉住苗，天旱时别人浇地补种，富有就没误这工，小苗长的又很好，到秋天数人家收粮重。晚谷一斗小米十五斤，富有一斗米十七斤。拿这个实例，说明早种与晚种差别很大，说服了群众，第二天群众都动开了。十天内，全村种了山药蛋五十二亩，棉花二十七亩，谷二百七十八亩，下种亩数占全村土地总数一半，谷已种完，现正修理玉茭地。（保江、世民）
