Inside the Hatta Cabinet
    Zhang Zhengming
    The Hatta puppet cabinet is a product of the machinations of American imperialism. It was not produced by a vote of confidence in the Indonesian National Assembly. Rather, the American puppet president (Sukarno) directly authorized Hatta to take the stage. Therefore, it is not responsible to the Indonesian National Assembly, but to the US and the president under its wing. It can be said that it is a dictatorship of a few pro-American traitors in Indonesia.
    The Hatta cabinet is mainly composed of the Nationalist Party and the Islamic Party, united with the Catholic Party, the Christian Party and so-called "non-partisan" people. Among the sixteen cabinet members, the main powers are controlled by the Nationalist and Islamic parties.
    Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Hatta is the leader of the Nationalist Party (also known as the National Nationalist Party). Other departments such as finance, justice, and education are all controlled by the Nationalist Party. The party represents the interests of princes, nobles, big landlords and capitalists. Hatta himself was born into a feudal aristocratic family in the Bukit Tinggi fortress area of ​​Sumatra. After completing his higher education locally, he went to the Netherlands for education in 1922. During his stay in the Netherlands, he infiltrated the "East Indies Association" (a progressive anti-Dutch group of Indonesian intellectuals in Europe) and once usurped the leadership of the association. At that time, he had close political relations with the reactionary leaders of the Dutch Social Democratic Party. His advocacy of anti-Dutch sentiment was only aimed at using the "East Indies Association" to attack the progressive elements within the association who were truly striving for independence for Indonesia. He was eventually purged from the "East Indies Association" for carrying out this conspiracy to sabotage the Indonesian national liberation movement.
    This discredited opportunistic politician was also despised by Dutch imperialism, which was still reeling from the aftermath of the Indonesian Revolution of 1926. He was driven back to Java by the Dutch Emperor in 1931. The following year, Hatta went to Japan, vainly attempting to use external forces (Japanese invaders) to force Dutch imperialism to make some concessions to the aristocratic, landlord, and capitalist classes of Indonesia. Since then, he established close economic ties with the Japanese invaders. He opened a "Sumatra" trading house in Batavia, becoming a loyal agent for dumping Japanese goods. Until 1933, when he was exiled to New Guinea by the Dutch Emperor for organizing the Nationalist Party, Hatta's political activities were always opposed to the advanced parties of the Indonesian independence movement.
    After the outbreak of the Pacific War and the Japanese invasion and occupation of Indonesia, Hatta and Sukarno were released at the same time, and cooperated with the Japanese invaders. Under the bayonets of the Japanese invaders, he successively served as the speaker of the puppet "National Council" of Sumatra, and a member of the Tariff and Constitution Committee.
    Hatta, like other leading figures of the Nationalist Party, belongs to the right wing of the Indonesian ruling class and is highly compromising with imperialism and feudal reactionary forces. This right-wing group has dominated the leadership of the Indonesian Republic for more than two years. They resisted various democratic reforms (such as confiscation of large plantations, nationalization of industry, mobilization of the masses, etc.), and repeatedly adopted policies of suppression against the Indonesian people and their leader, the Indonesian Communist Party, who resolutely resisted American and Dutch imperialism. Among the top advisors of the Indonesian Republic, they recruited Trotskyite spies such as Tan Malaka. They even shielded and condoned their organizational activities of sabotaging the war of resistance and undermining unity (according to reliable information, one-third of the Indonesian army in Solo alone was controlled by Trotskyite spies); thus hindering the strength of the Indonesian people's all-out resistance. Not only that, even during the period when the Indonesian people were fighting a life-and-death struggle with American and Dutch imperialism, they were still secretly colluding with American imperialism. According to Indonesian democratic newspapers, Hatta and other Nationalist Party reactionaries had requested a loan of 100 million US dollars from the US in exchange for allowing US monopoly capital to control Indonesia's important resources. In late October of last year, they expressed wavering and compromise to the representatives of the imperialist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and Belgium in the Six-Nation Consular Corps, violating the Indonesian people's policy of resolute resistance and advocating that Indonesia reopen "peace talks" with the Dutch Emperor. This kind of treasonous collusion became even more apparent before and after the "Renville" negotiations. From the day the Nationalist Party was born, it has had a blood-related connection with the right wing of the Islamic Party in politics and economy.
    The Islamic Party occupies a more important position in the new cabinet than in previous cabinets. Sukiman served as the Minister of the Interior, while other Islamic Party members occupied the departments of economy, propaganda, and religion. As everyone knows, the reorganization of the previous Sjahrir cabinet in November last year (on the eve of the Renville negotiations) was the result of American imperialist instigation and compromise by the Nationalist Party reactionaries with the Islamic Party. Before this, the Islamic Party had requested to join the cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, threatening the Sjahrir cabinet with activities to overthrow the cabinet. After the reorganization, the Islamic Party joined the cabinet, and Sukiman became the First Deputy Prime Minister and was absorbed as a member of the Indonesian delegation to the Renville negotiations, working with Hatta to hold secret negotiations with the US, the Dutch, and the Indonesian national traitors in the West Java Split Conference. The Islamic Party played an active role in the "Renville" agreement and the conspiracy to overthrow the Sjahrir cabinet.
    Historically, since the First World War, the Islamic Party (which was derived from the "Islamic League" and has a more reactionary nature) has been manipulated by reactionary leaders at the top. During the Indonesian Revolution of 1926, the Islamic Party leaders Cokroaminoto and Aminoto (i.e. Sukarno's father-in-law, Sukarno had joined the party) completely colluded with Dutch imperialism, acting as accomplices of the Dutch Emperor in suppressing the Indonesian independence and liberation movement, which was one of the main reasons for the failure of the Indonesian Revolution. Generally speaking, the Islamic Party represents the interests of Indonesian feudal owners (such as cotton yarn industry, tobacco industry, native products industry, etc.). Because it is cloaked in religious garb (more than 90% of the Indonesian people believe in Islam), it has long been covering up the reactionary features of its upper-level leaders who are hostile to the Indonesian Communist Party and the working class. They have used the heroic deeds of the Indonesian people's anti-Dutch struggle to consolidate their political and economic position.
    The so-called "non-partisan" Foreign Minister Salim is the spokesperson of Indonesian pro-American traitors. He successively served as the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Sjahrir cabinet and the Foreign Minister of the Sjahriruddin cabinet. He was also a member of the Indonesian delegation for Indonesian-Dutch negotiations, and actually implemented the traitorous pro-American foreign policy. After the establishment of the Hatta puppet cabinet, he remained in his original position. During the Sjahriruddin cabinet, he visited the United States to beg for loans from the US; after returning to Indonesia, he advocated establishing "diplomatic relations" with the Philippine traitor Roxas government.
    Another characteristic of the Hatta cabinet is that it has collected a group of Dutch imperialist lackeys from the Christian Party and the Catholic Party. These two political parties have always been tools for the Dutch to enslave and paralyze the Indonesian people, and are worms used by the Dutch Emperor to divide and provoke Indonesian national unity. It mainly represents the pro-Dutch upper-level officials and enslaved personnel of the ruling class. Among the Sundanese and Ambonese ethnic groups (mainly living in eastern Java and the western Bos Islands), these two parties have great influence and power. The Sundanese and Ambonese ethnic groups claim to be "one level stronger (?) than other ethnic groups in Indonesia"; Dutch imperialism also used their deceived ignorance to organize indigenous troops and send them to areas inhabited by Muslims such as Java, Madura, and Sumatra. They often become the vanguard in suppressing the Indonesian revolutionary movement.
    When Dutch imperialism began to plan the conspiracy to split the Indonesian Republic, it first bought off a few scoundrels from the Sundanese and Ambonese ethnic groups. This is the reason why the "East Indies (puppet) government" was able to be completed so soon. Even today, the Christian and Catholic parties are still playing a shameful role in betraying the interests of the Indonesian nation. The Christian Party cadre Reymona, who has now been promoted to Minister of Health, was originally a slave under the command of Hatta and Sukiman. He served as the chairman of the Armistice Technical Committee of the Indonesian delegation to the Renville negotiations, and was favored by the American and Dutch imperialists for promoting the conclusion of the humiliating Renville armistice agreement.
    The Hatta cabinet's policy after its establishment more clearly reflects its traitorous and anti-people essence. The first step was to transfer the "special powers and rights" (military, political, economic, diplomatic) of the Indonesian Republic to the "Interim Government of the United States of Indonesia" being established by the US and the Netherlands, guaranteeing full "cooperation" with the US and the Netherlands "on the basis of the instructions of the Three-Nation Mediation Committee and the Renville Agreement." Therefore, less than half a month after Dutch invasion army commander Spoor summoned Indonesian army commander Sudirman, 29,000 Indonesian troops withdrew from the so-called "bag-shaped area" and are continuing to withdraw. The Indonesian reactionary ruling class is sitting idly by as the Dutch invaders ravage the defenseless Indonesian people in the evacuation area and other places. They are bewildered by the "aid" of US dollars, and now they no longer care about the disaster that will be caused by the Dutch army's continued increase of troops in Indonesia, nor do they make any superficial "protests." They are merely desperately begging their American and Dutch masters for scraps in the "interim government." In order to prevent the angry resistance that the Indonesian people have already launched, they have promulgated reactionary laws (prohibiting demonstrations and mass struggle actions).
    Obviously, the Hatta puppet cabinet has become a pillar for the US and the Netherlands to rebuild colonial rule in Indonesia. Its existence has become a stumbling block in the way of the Indonesian people's struggle against American and Dutch imperialism. To achieve the final victory in the Indonesian people's independence and liberation movement, this stumbling block must be removed.

　　哈达内阁内幕
    张正明
    哈达傀儡内阁是美帝国主义一手扶植下的产物，它不是由印尼国民议会信任投票的结果产生的，而是美帝伪总统（苏加诺）之手，直接授权哈达粉墨登场。因此，它不向印尼国民议会负责，而是向美帝及其卵翼下的总统负责。可以说，它是印尼的少数亲美叛国分子的专政。
    哈达内阁是以国民党、回教党为主体，联合天主教党、基督教党及所谓“无党派”人士凑合起来的。在十六名阁员中，主要职权系由国民、回教两党所把持。
    总理兼国防部长哈达，系国民党（亦称国家民族主义党）党魁，其他如财政、司法、教育等部，均掌握在国民党手里。该党系代表王公贵族、大地主资本家的利益。哈达本人就是出身于苏岛德哥克要塞区的封建贵族家庭。他在当地完成高等学校学业后，即于一九二二年赴荷兰受教育，居荷期间曾混进“东印度协会”（印尼留欧知识分子的反荷进步团体），并一度篡夺该会的领导权。当时他就和荷兰社会民主党的反动领袖，在政治上过从甚密。而它的鼓吹反荷，仅在利用“东印度协会”，去打击该会内部真正为印尼争取独立的进步分子，他终究因进行这种破坏印尼民族解放运动的阴谋，而被清洗出“东印度协会”。
    这一声名狼籍的投机政客，亦为正于一九二六年印尼大革命风暴余威的荷兰帝国主义所不齿，他于一九三一年被荷帝驱回爪哇，翌年哈达即转赴日本，妄图借助于外力（日寇），使荷兰帝国主义对印尼的贵族、地主、资本家阶级作某种程度的让步。此后，他就和日寇建立密切的经济联系。他在巴城开了一个“苏门答腊号”商行，成为倾销日货的忠实代理人。直至一九三三年，因组织国家主义党被荷帝放逐至新几尼亚为止，哈达的政治活动，始终是与印尼独立运动的先进党派相对立的。
    太平洋战争爆发，日寇侵占印尼后，哈达即与苏加诺同时被释，并与日寇合作，在日寇刺刀下，历任苏岛伪“国民参议会”议长，关税及宪法委员会委员等要职。
    哈达和国民党的其他主导人物一样，是属于印尼统治阶级的右派，对帝国主义及封建反动势力富于妥协性。这一右派集团，两年余来霸占了印尼共和国的领导权。他们拒抗各项民主改革（如象没收大农庄、工业国有化、动员群众等等），而对于坚决反抗美、荷帝国主义的印尼人民及其领导者印尼共产党，则一再采取抑压政策。在印尼共和国的最高顾问中，网罗了陈马六甲之流的托派奸细分子。甚至包庇和纵容他们破坏抗战、破坏团结的组织活动（据确息，仅梭罗一城之印尼军，即有三分之一被托派奸细分子所控制）；因而阻碍了印尼人民全面抗战的力量。不仅如此，即在印尼人民与美荷帝国主义作殊死战的斗争时期，他们也还暗中与美帝国主义进行勾搭。据印尼民主报纸载称：哈达等国民党反动派曾要求美帝予以一亿美元的贷款，而以容许美国独占资本控制印尼重要资源作为交换条件。去年十月下旬，他们就向六国领事团的美、英、法、比等帝国主义代表，表示了动摇和妥协，违反印尼人民坚决抗战的方针，而力主印尼与荷帝重开“和谈”。这种卖国勾当，在“伦维尔”谈判前后是更加原形毕露了。从国民党产生之日起，他和回教党右派在政治上、经济上，就有着血肉相关的联系。
    回教党在新内阁中，比历届内阁都占着更重要的地位。苏基曼任内相，其他回教党党员则霸占经济、宣传、宗教等部。众所周知，前沙利佛丁内阁去年十一月间（伦维尔谈判前夕）的改组，系美帝唆使以及国民党反动派向回教党妥协的结果。在这以前，回教党就曾提出要求入阁担任副总理与内相，而以倒阁活动向沙利佛丁内阁进行威胁。改组后回教党入阁，苏基曼即任第一副总理要职，并被吸收为伦维尔谈判之印尼代表团团员，协同哈达与美荷及西爪哇分裂会议中的印尼民族叛逆，举行秘密谈判。“伦维尔”协定及推翻沙利佛丁内阁的阴谋，回教党起了积极推动的作用。
    从历史上来看，自从第一次世界大战以来，回教党（它是从“回教同盟”派生出来的，具有更反动的性质）一直是在上层反动领导的操纵下，一九二六年印尼大革命时期，回教党首脑巧克罗、阿米诺多（即苏加诺之岳父，苏氏曾加入过该党）完全与荷兰帝国主义勾结，充当荷帝镇压印尼独立解放运动的帮凶，这是印尼大革命失败的主要原因之一。一般的说，回教党是代表印尼封建业主（如棉纱业、烟草业、土产业等）的利益，由于它披着宗教外衣（印尼民族百分之九十以上信奉回教），因而曾经长期＠盖着它的上层领导人物，敌视印尼共产党及工人阶级的反动面目，他们利用了印尼人民反荷斗争的英勇事迹，来巩固他们在政治经济上的地位。
    所谓“无党派人士”外长沙立姆，系印尼亲美叛卖分子的代言人，历任沙利尔内阁外次、沙利佛丁内阁外长，他又是印荷谈判印方代表团团员，实际执行了卖国亲美的外交政策，哈达傀儡内阁成立，留任原职。在沙利佛丁内阁时期，他曾访问美国，向美帝乞求贷款；回印尼后，即力主与菲奸罗哈斯政府建立“外交关系”。
    哈达内阁之另一特点，便是搜罗了一批基督教党和天主教党中的荷兰帝国主义走卒。这两个政党一向是荷兰奴化、麻痹印尼人民的工具，是荷帝分化和挑拨印尼民族团结的驻虫。它主要系代表统治之亲荷上层官吏和奴化人员。在巽他和安汶民族（主要系居住于爪哇东部及西部伯斯诸岛）当中，这两党有很大的影响和势力。巽他安汶民族自称比印尼其他民族强大（？）”一等；荷兰帝国主义亦用他们受骗后的愚昧，组织土著军队，并派到爪哇、马都拉、苏岛等回教徒聚居的地区。他们经常成为弹压印尼革命运动的先锋。
    荷兰帝国主义开始策动分裂印尼共和国的阴谋，首先就收买了巽他安汶民族中的少数败类，“东印度（傀儡）政府”之所以能早日完成，其原因确在此。而基督教、天主教两党到今天还是扮演着出卖印尼民族利益的可耻角色。现升任为卫生部长的基督教党党徒雷梦纳，原系哈达、苏基曼指挥下的奴才，曾任伦维尔谈判印方代表团停战技术委员会主席，因促成辱国的伦维尔停战协定的订立，而受到美荷帝国主义的庞爱。
    哈达内阁成立后的施政方针，更加明显的反映其卖国反人民的实质。第一步便是将印尼共和国的“特别权力和权利”（军事、政治、经济、外交）移交给美荷筹建中的“印尼合众国临时政府”，在“三国调停委员会的指示与伦维尔协定基础上”，保证与美荷充分“合作”，因而当荷侵略军司令斯波尔召见印尼军司令苏迪曼后，不及半月，即有二万九千名印尼军，自所谓“袋形地带”撤离，并正在继续撤离中。印尼反动统治阶级，坐视荷寇蹂躏撤离区及各地手无寸铁的印尼人民，它们迷惑于美元的“援助”，现在已经不去顾及荷军继续增兵印尼所将引起的灾祸，也不再作任何表面的“抗议”。而仅仅为着在“临时政府”中争得残羹余饭，喋喋不休的向其美荷主子嘶声哀求。他们为着防范印尼人民已经发动起来的愤怒的反抗，而颁布了反动的法令（禁止示威及其群众斗争行动）。
    显然，哈达傀儡内阁已成为美荷在印尼重建殖民地统治的支柱，它的存在，已成为印尼人民反抗美荷帝国主义斗争途中的绊脚石。印尼人民独立解放运动要取得最后胜利，必须搬掉这块绊脚石。
