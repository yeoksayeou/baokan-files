　　Yu Bei Local Armed Forces Combine Military and Political Offensives
  　Mutual Disintegration of Bandit Gangs Achieves Great Results
    Local Puppet Troops Vie to Ask Me for "Certificates of Honorable Return"
    [Our Dispatch] The Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district's backbone regiment and battalion, combining military and political offensives, have continuously annihilated small groups of invading enemies, achieving repeated victories. This has blunted the enemy's ferocious attacks, and deeply frightened big and small bandits who stubbornly cling to their positions. Under the influence of our policies and the impact of military strikes, the bandit gangs, whose adherence was often blind, have largely disintegrated without a formal disbanding, or exist only in name. Chiang Kai-shek's lower-level soldiers are constantly defecting to the Liberation Army, especially those who surrender their weapons during combat. The fifth company of the second battalion of the notorious bandit Guo Qing's unit was completely annihilated by our Ye County Brigade in Dong Yucao Village. Besides killing 15 of them, we captured 62 enemy soldiers, including the company commander. The enemy's 40th Division's forces protecting Hui County and Huo County, as well as the 4th Special Security Brigade, have often had entire squads, platoons, or even companies annihilated by us. Throughout the entire spring campaign, the ratio of enemy to our personnel losses was approximately 40 to 1. The sub-district originally planned to kill 700 enemies and seize 200 rifles and 5 light machine guns during the spring campaign. Now, in 170 large and small battles, we have killed and wounded 523 enemy officers and soldiers, captured 1,509 enemy officers and soldiers, seized 3 small artillery pieces, 18 light machine guns, 772 rifles and carbines, 34 pistols, 65,000 rounds of ammunition of various kinds, 2 radio stations, 7 telephones, and over 1,000 pounds of recovered electrical wire. On average, we have exceeded the sub-district's enemy elimination plan by one and a half times. The 49th Regiment, on a long-distance expedition to Changyuan, Fengqiu, Yanjin, and other places, disintegrated armed secret society groups, capturing three times as many bandits as the original enemy elimination plan. (Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district)
    [Our Dispatch from Taihang, 24th] In the border areas of northern Henan, strengthening political offensives to disintegrate Chiang's puppet troops and bandit gangs has yielded great results. In recent days, more than 20 people have returned. The Sixth District of Qi County, through publicizing the land law and using returned masses to send messages to Chiang's bandit soldiers, has persuaded 14 bandit gangs to return, including two platoon leaders. In the outskirts of Jiaozuo, we specially made "Certificates of Honorable Return" for the puppet soldiers to hold when they return. Many family members of puppet soldiers are vying to ask us for "insurance slips" ("Certificates of Honorable Return"). The propaganda materials we distribute outside Chiang's bandit strongholds at night are being picked up by the enemy. Many soldiers under the command of puppet bandit Wang Fengying are asking their families to come to the liberated areas to get "insurance slips" in preparation for their return. One villager even told us, "You shouldn't paste them too tightly. The other day, I saw the self-defense corps (puppet troops) all vying to tear off the 'insurance slips' pasted on the wall." One woman, a family member of a puppet soldier, after understanding our policies, immediately took some propaganda materials and "Certificates of Honorable Return" to Bei Zhu Village. When she saw her husband, her husband said, "Why didn't you bring more 'insurance slips'?" The puppet soldiers' eagerness to return home is evident from this.

　　豫北地武结合政治攻势
  　互解会队收效极大
    各地伪军争着向我要“荣归证”
    【本报消息】太行五分区基干团及营兵结合政治攻势，不断歼灭敌小股出犯，迭获胜利，使敌顿挫凶焰，死心塌地之大小匪首均极恐慌，盲目附从之会队及蒋匪下层士兵，在我政策感召和武力打击下，会队大部无形解体或仅具空名，蒋匪士兵络绎逃来解放军，尤以战斗中缴枪投降者日众。惯匪郭清部第二营第五连在东于曹村被我邺县大队予以全部歼灭，除毙其十五名外，俘该敌连长以下六十二名。敌四十师辉保、获保及四专保安旅等，均常遭我歼灭其整班整排或整连。整个春季作战中，敌我人员损失约为四十比一。分区春季原订杀敌七百人，缴步枪二百支，轻机枪五挺；现大小战斗一百七十次，毙伤敌官兵五百二十三名，俘敌官兵一千五百零九名，缴获小炮三门，轻机枪十八挺，步马枪七百七十二支，短枪三十四支，各种弹药六万五千发，电台两部，电话机七部，收电线千余斤。平均超过分区杀敌计划一倍半。四十九团远征长垣、封邱、延津等地，瓦解会门武装，俘匪人数超过杀敌计划三倍。（太行第五军分区）
    【本报太行二十四日电】豫北边地在加强政攻，瓦解蒋伪军及会队中收效很大，近日来归者已有二十多名。淇县六区在宣传土地法及以归来群众向蒋匪士兵的传信中，已争取回会队十四个，内有排长两个。在焦作外围，我特制有“荣归证”，让伪军士兵持证归来；有许多伪军家属，都争着向我们要“保险条”（“荣归证”）。我们晚上到蒋匪据点外散发的宣传品都被敌人拾去了。伪匪王凤英部下的好多士兵，都叫他们家人到解放区来要“保险条”准备回来，有一个老乡并对我们说：“你们贴的不要太紧了，那天我见自卫团（伪军）都争着撕墙上贴的‘保险条’哩。”有一个伪属妇女，她了解我们政策后，即带了一部分宣传品及“荣归证”到了北朱村，见了她男人，她男人说：“怎么你不多带来些‘保险条’呢”？伪军士兵归家心切，由此可见。
