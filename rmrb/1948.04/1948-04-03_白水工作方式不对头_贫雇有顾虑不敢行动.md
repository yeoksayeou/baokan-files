　　Incorrect Work Methods in Baishui
  　Poor and Hired Peasants Have Concerns and Dare Not Act
    [Wuzhi News] Villages around Baishui in the second district of Wuzhi are only thirty li away from enemy strongholds, and the masses have "change of dynasty" thoughts. In addition, they have misunderstandings about some problems in our past policy implementation (such as a very broad struggle scope), and their thinking is apprehensive. After the work team arrived in the village, they did not fully understand this situation. At the beginning, they did not dare to boldly publicize the Land Law, fearing that the landlords would be prepared. They also did not take good care of the old village cadres, and went to visit the poor and hired peasants, with the result that the poor and hired peasants dared not approach us. When Comrade × arrived at Yao Wenxi's house, the whole family was eating in the yard. As soon as they saw him enter, the man picked up his bowl and went out the gate, and the woman went back into the house. He had no choice but to leave feeling awkward. The poor peasant Hulu was hoeing wheat in the field, and when he saw the comrades from the work team approaching, he shouldered his hoe and went to the west end. Wang Binglan hadn't finished hoeing, so he went home without hoeing. The poor and hired peasants encountered all showed that they did not dare to approach us. Even when talking together, they would hum in response to a question, and would not speak unless asked. The comrades of the work team were very distressed. After research and reflection from individual poor and hired peasants, they realized that it was because there had been no public propaganda. The poor and hired peasants did not know our intentions, and there were also few poor and hired peasants being approached, making these few people feel very isolated. In addition, there was sabotage by the landlords, and the policy towards village cadres had not been clearly explained. They only heard news reports of cadres being punished, which confused the village cadres, who thought that this time cadres would be struggled against, so they were also very afraid. After studying these situations, the work team convened a meeting of middle and poor peasants, clarifying the policy of land redistribution towards all classes, cracking down on the sabotage of the landlords, stabilizing the emotions of the middle peasants, and giving the poor and hired peasants confidence that the intention was to overthrow landlord feudalism. At the same time, it was also explained that cadres would only be punished for mistakes if they refused to correct them, and the cadres became more honest. After the meeting, the poor peasant Hulu said: "It's not that I don't want to approach you, it's mainly because I'm afraid that like before, people will be arrested, and I can't afford that responsibility." From then on, the poor and hired peasants dared to approach us, and the comrades of the work team also more boldly publicized the policy and widely approached the masses (including the middle peasants), focusing on mobilizing the poor and hired peasants. Five days later, a poor and hired peasant group of twelve people was organized in the main street, and seven people in the south street. Although the north street was not organized, individual relationships were developed, and the mood was good. (Jiang Bo)

　　白水工作方式不对头
  　贫雇有顾虑不敢行动
    【武陟消息】武陟二区白水一带村庄，离敌据点只三十余里，群众有变天思想；又加对我们过去执行政策上的某些毛病（如斗争面很宽）发生错觉，思想有顾虑。工作组到村后，对这种情况了解不够，开头不敢大胆宣传土地法，怕地主有了准备；对老底子（旧村干）亦没有很好的照管，就去访问贫雇，结果贫雇都不敢接近我们。×同志到了姚文喜家时，全家正在院吃饭，一见他进去，男人端上碗出了街门，女人回了屋里，他只好没意思的出来；贫农胡芦在地里锄麦，见工作组的同志去了，便扛上锄到了西头；王炳兰本来还没锄完，就回家不锄了。遇到的贫雇均表现不敢接近我们，就是在一起谈话也是问一句哼一声，不问不说。工作组的同志非常苦闷，经研究和个别贫雇的反映，才知是没有公开宣传，贫雇不知我们的来意，同时接近的贫雇也少，这几个人感觉很孤立，再加地主的破坏，以及对村干的政策也没有很好的讲明，他们光听到报上尽是处分干部的消息，使村干摸不着头脑，以为这回要斗争干部，所以也很害怕。工作组研究了这些情况后，便召集了中贫农大会，讲明了平分土地对各阶层的政策，打击了地主的破坏，稳定了中农情绪，贫雇有了底，知道是搞地主封建，同时也说明干部有错只要改就行，干部也老实了。会后，贫雇胡芦说：“不是俺不接近你，主要是怕象前时一样，扣起人了，俺担不起。”从此贫雇也敢接近我们了，工作组同志也更加大胆的宣传，普遍接近群众（包括中农），有重点发动贫雇。五天以后，大街组织了一个贫雇小组十二个人，南街七个人，北街虽没组织起来，个别的发生关系，情绪也不错。（江波）
