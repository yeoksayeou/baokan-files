　　Class Designation Should Be Based on Recent Actual Circumstances
    Recently, many readers have raised questions about class designation, and we will do our best to answer them. However, many questions either have overly simple information, such as the one from Chuntang and others: "There is a household with very little land, a lot of movable property, and they also raise a flock of sheep..."; or they only have information from ten years ago, without information from the past seven or eight years. (Because after the establishment of the local democratic government, landlords who have labored for five years can have their class designation changed.) We cannot answer these unclear questions. We hope that when readers ask questions, they provide detailed and specific information about the population (how many people eat, how many people labor), land (quantity, yield, local average land per person), housing, livestock, and major sources of livelihood in the past ten years.

    Mengjia Village is a key point village in the Fifth District of Lincheng. There are two types of households in this village that have caused disputes in class designation, and the problems have not been resolved:
    I. Li Yuqing relied on collecting rent and debts for a relative before the War of Resistance to make a living, and later also acquired seven mu of land. After the incident (likely the July 7 Incident, marking the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War), when our army arrived here, his business of collecting rent and debts could no longer be done, and he went back home to cultivate the land himself (returned in 1927); his family has one and a half laborers. From 1927 to 1929, he often hired half a worker. In 1930, he hired a full-time worker (because he was in charge of unified progressive tax in the village). In 1931, he hired a single worker for three months (that is, hired a person to work for three months of the year). In 1932, he hired a worker for one month. His family has five people and originally had six mu and eight fen and one li of land. Before the incident, he acquired seven mu, totaling thirteen mu and eight fen and one li. In 1931, he sold one mu and eight fen, and in 1934, he sold one mu, two fen, and five li. He now has ten point seven six mu of land.
    In the designation of class, there are two opinions: One is that, according to his original land and yield, he is a poor peasant; however, he acquired seven mu of land through exploitation, and he also hired workers later. Although the exploitation was not great, the root of it came from exploitation, not from his own hard work since childhood. He should be classified as a feudal rich peasant. The second opinion is that, according to the calculation of years, his labor and non-exploitation have exceeded five years, and he should not be classified as a feudal rich peasant; but if we consider his root as "exploited," can he be classified as a rich peasant who started by working? This cannot be resolved.
    II. Yue Qingwen was an exploitative household before the War of Resistance. Later (in 1938), the family divided. After the division, there were three people in his family and more than six mu of land. Since the division, he has been managing himself and working hard without exploitation; however, his property also came from exploitation, not created by his own hard work. According to his class designation, he is still a rich peasant. What kind of rich peasant is he considered?
    We hope to receive a definite opinion on the above two questions.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Fifth District Working Group Pengnian, Su Hua

    Answer: In your debate, you are not basing it on the actual situation in recent years, but clinging to the exploitation ten years ago, going around in circles in the rich peasant category. This view is completely wrong. If Li Yuqing lived by helping landlords collect rent and manage affairs ten years ago, his position was as an assistant to the landlord rather than a servant, and his labor and other living conditions were the same as the landlord's, then he can be considered a landlord; otherwise, further research is needed. But later, according to what you said: he "has been laboring and not exploiting for more than five years," then he should not be classified as a "feudal rich peasant" or a "rich peasant who started by working," but should change his class designation according to the actual situation and be assessed as a peasant (middle peasant or other). Yue Qingwen has been laboring himself and not exploiting for ten years, regardless of where his six mu of land came from, he should not be said to be a rich peasant, but should be classified as a middle peasant or poor peasant according to his situation in the last ten years.

    Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, a family has had a large population and little land, twenty people and thirty mu of land, which is not enough to cultivate. They also rent more than ten mu of land, but this is still not enough to support the whole family, so they use other people's furniture and land to open an oil mill and soy sauce and vinegar shop, only hiring one technician for vinegar and one oil maker, and the rest of the family does the work themselves. During the busy farming season, except for the vinegar maker who watches the door, the whole family participates in labor. They make soy sauce after the wheat harvest and vinegar after the autumn harvest. They have to buy a lot of grain every year. Some people believe that he is a rich peasant because he hires oil and vinegar makers and exploits; others say that the whole family labors and also rents land, hiring people to do business, which is not considered feudal. In this village, the average land per person is four or five mu, while this family has less than two mu per person.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Liu Derui

    Answer: The information about this family is not detailed enough, so we cannot give a specific answer. However, if they only hire oil and vinegar technicians, it can be said with certainty that they are not feudal rich peasants, but rather farmers兼handicraftsmen. In terms of agriculture, it can be determined according to the actual situation; in terms of handicrafts, if their main source of livelihood comes from the oil mill and soy sauce and vinegar shop, then it depends on the family's participation in the labor of the oil and vinegar shop. If the family participates in the main labor of the oil and vinegar shop, although they also hire workers or shop assistants, they should be considered handicraft laborers. However, if workers or shop assistants are the main part of their production business, and the family only provides incidental labor, or only holds a supervisory and management position, then they should be considered handicraft capitalists. The property of handicraft laborers who are wealthy due to handicraft income shall not be infringed upon under any circumstances, but they should not be given land or other property again. The property and business of handicraft capitalists should also be resolutely protected.

    When my grandfather was alive, he worked as a tenant farmer for others. My father also worked as a tenant farmer for others and was also a broker for homespun cloth. He was also the village deputy in the 22nd and 23rd years of the Republic of China. My father passed away in the first year that the Japanese occupied Handan. During the Japanese occupation, I still lived with my younger brother. My younger brother was forced to join the garrison as a soldier for two years and was a squad leader for three or four months to support the family. After Handan was liberated, I was struggled against once in 1946 during the anti-traitor and clearing of accounts movement, and again last year during the squeezing out feudal elements movement. After my brother was struggled against in 1946, I separated from him and lived separately. Last year, when squeezing out feudal elements, I was working in ××. The higher authorities, knowing that my brother had been a puppet soldier, squeezed me out and handed me over to the masses of my village for disposal. When the masses held a meeting, they had no opinions about me. I have been from a poor family since I was a child. After my father passed away, I apprenticed for seven or eight years, rode a bicycle to run a small business for one or two years, and was a broker for two years. There are many people in my family, and we can barely make a living. I myself have never done anything bad in my life, nor have I been a traitor, nor have I exploited anyone. Now, the household registration form in my village lists me as a "struggled against household." I think this is unreasonable. Whether the things are returned to me or not doesn't matter to me. The question is, am I considered a "struggled against household" or not?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ji Dong

    Answer: According to the situation you described, you should not be listed as a "struggled against household"; this issue can be reasonably resolved when the work team comes to your village to fill out and rectify the party.

### 订成份应根据近年来实际情况

专栏：编读往来

　　订成份应根据近年来实际情况
    最近有不少读者提出关于划成份的问题，我们当尽力解答。但有许多问题，或者材料过于简单，如春堂等所提：“有一户土地很少，浮财很多，还喂着一群羊……”；或者光有十年前的情况，没有近七八年的情况。（因为当地民主政权成立后，地主劳动五年变成份。）类似这些提得不清楚的问题，我们都无法答复。希望读者提问题时，详细具体的把人口（几个人吃饭，几个人劳动）、土地（数量、产量、当地土地每人平均数）、房屋、牲口以及近十年内主要生活来源等写出来。　　　——编者编辑同志：
    孟家庄，是临城五区的一个基点村，在这村子里有这样两个类型的户，在划成份中起了争执，没有解决了问题：
    一、李玉庆，在抗战前是依靠给他的一个亲戚收租、讨帐、剥削吃饭，后来也置了七亩地。事变后，我军到了这里，他的那种收租、讨帐、剥削营生就干不开了，自己回家耕作起地来（二七年回来的）；自家有一个半劳力，二七年到二九年，常觅半个人工，三○年觅过一个整工（这时因为他在村办统累税），三一年觅过三个月单抽工（即一年中觅定一个人做够三个月活），三二年时，又觅过一个月工。他家五口人，原有地六亩八分一，事变前置了七亩，共十三亩八分一，三一年卖去了一亩八分，三四年又卖去了一亩二分五，现有地一○·七六亩。
    在订成份中，有两个意见：一种是，按他原地原产量是一个贫农；可是靠削削置了七亩地，并且后来还觅过工，剥削虽然不大，但是根子是剥削来的，不是从他小时亲手劳动起来的，这应划为封建富农。第二种意见是：按年代计算，他的劳动和不剥削已经超过了五年，不应该将他划成封建富农；可要按他的根子“剥削过”，是不是能划成劳动起家的富农？这个没有办法解决。
    二、岳青文，抗战前是个剥削户，后来（一九三八年）就分家，分家后有人三口，地六亩多，他从分开就是自己经营，亲身劳动，没有剥削了；但是他的产业，也是剥削来的，并不是他亲手劳动创造起来的，按成份他现在还是一个富农，究竟算个什么富农？
    以上两个问题，希告我们一个肯定的意见。　五区工作组朋年、苏华
    答：你们争论中，都不根据其近几年来的实际情况，而咬住十年前的剥削，在富农圈子里打转，这种观点是完全错误的。李玉庆，如果十年前曾帮助地主收租管家为生，他的地位为地主的助手而非仆役，而且他当时劳动状况和其他生活状况同于地主，可以地主论；否则，还要研究。但以后，根据你们所说：他“劳动和不剥削已经超过了五年”，那就不该划成“封建富农”，或者“劳动起家的富农”，而应按实际情况改变成份，评定为农民（中农或其他）。岳青文自己劳动不剥削已经十年，不管他的六亩多地从哪里来的，也不应该说是富农，而应根据其近十年来的情况，订为中农或贫农。　——编者编辑同志：
    一家自抗日战争以来，就是人多地少，二十来口人，三十来亩地，不够种，还租入十几亩地，这样还顾不住全家生活，才用人家的家具、地方开一座油坊和醋酱铺，仅雇技师醋油匠各一人，都是自家干。农忙时，除醋匠看门外，全家参加劳动。每年收麦后作酱，收秋后作醋。这样每年要买好多粮食。有人根据他雇油醋匠有剥削，认为是富农；有人说全家劳动，还租入土地，雇人做生意，不算封建。这村按人口每人平均四、五亩地，这家每人不到二亩。　刘得瑞
    答：这一家庭情况谈得不详细，无法具体答复。不过如果只是雇用油醋技师，可以肯定说不是封建富农，而是农民兼手工业者成份。在农业方面，可按实际情况来订定；在手工业方面，如果其生活主要来源是靠油坊和醋酱坊，那么就要看他家庭参加油醋坊劳动状况来决定。如果其家庭参加油醋坊主要劳动，虽同时招收工人或店员，应认为是手工业劳动者。但如果以工人或店员为其生产业务中的主体，其家庭只有附带劳动，或只居监督管理地位者，则应认为手工业资本家。手工业劳动者之因手工业收入而生活富裕者，其财产一概不得侵犯，但也不应再分给土地或其他财产。手工业资本家的财产和营业亦应当受到坚决的保护。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者编辑同志：
    我祖父在时给人家代种地，我父亲时亦给人家代种地，还当过土布经纪，民国二十二、三年亦当过村副。日寇占邯郸头年，我父已去世了。日寇统治时，我还与我弟同居过生活，我弟为家中生活逼迫，到警备队当士兵二年，当小分队长有三、四个月。邯郸解放后，一九四六年反奸清算，被斗过一次，去年挤封建运动又被斗一次。一九四六年我弟被斗后，我与他就分门另居。去年挤封建，我在××工作，上级了解我弟当过伪军，就将我挤出交俺村群众处理，群众开大会时，对俺啥意见也没有。我自幼就是贫家出身，我父去世，我学生意七、八年，骑自行车跑小商有一、二年，当经纪人有二年，我家中人多，仅能顾住生活。我本身一生也没作过坏事，也没当过汉奸，也没剥削过人。现在我村户口表上填的我是被斗户，我觉得道理不通，东西退不退我没啥，问题到底我算被斗户不算？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　季东
    答：据你所说的情况，你不应列为“被斗户”；这个问题，可等工作组到你村进行填补整党时，提出合理解决。——编者
