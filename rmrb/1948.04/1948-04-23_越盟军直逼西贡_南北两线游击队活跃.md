Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Saigon dispatch: Viet Minh forces have recently directly approached the heart of French imperialist rule in Vietnam. The French imperialist authorities in Saigon are greatly alarmed by the Viet Minh guerrillas' advance on the surroundings of Saigon's Cholon area. They formally announced on the 17th that the night curfew in the suburbs of Saigon-Cholon would be implemented earlier, changing from 8:00 PM to 7:00 PM until 5:00 AM the next morning. It is reported that gunfire and volleys from Viet Minh attacking forces have been heard almost every night in Saigon and other cities for the past two weeks.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Various dispatches: According to the Saigon French invasion army's high command's weekly (May 5th to 11th) war report, Viet Minh guerrillas are frequently active on both the northern and southern fronts. In Cochinchina, Viet Minh forces have launched attacks on railway and canal transportation lines and harassed French imperialist strongholds around Saigon such as My Tho, Mo Cay, Chau Doc, and Long Phuoc Hai. In Bien Hoa district, 20 kilometers northeast of Saigon, Viet Minh garrison troops have launched a blocking war against the enemy. In Tonkin: the French-Vietnamese war in the "Delta" region is in full swing, and Viet Minh mountain guerrillas are strengthening their attacks on the invading French patrol forces. Fighting is also taking place in many areas of the central region. The American imperialists' aid to the French in their attempt to subjugate Vietnam has gained further proof. According to a TASS report from Bangkok broadcast on the 12th, citing a Wolward report, all the weapons and ammunition captured in the Viet Minh's war of resistance against the French are of American manufacture. The Vietnamese people are deeply indignant at the U.S. authorities' blatant support for French imperialism in suppressing the Vietnamese independence movement.

　　越盟军直逼西贡
  　南北两线游击队活跃
    【新华社陕北二十日电】西贡讯：越盟军近已直逼法帝统治越南的心脏地区。西贡法帝当局因越盟游击军进迫西贡堤岸周围，大为恐慌；已于十七日正式宣布，西贡堤岸近郊之夜间戒严令提早施行，由过去午后八时起，改为自午后七时至次晨五时止。据悉，西贡等城近两周来几乎每夜均听到越盟攻击部队的炮声与排枪声。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】各方讯：据西贡法侵略军最高指挥部一周（五至十一日）战报显示，越盟游击队在南北各线活动频繁。交趾支那方面，越盟武装曾纷向铁路和运河交通线进军，并袭扰西贡周围之美沙、莫开、朱笃、龙福元等法帝据点。西贡东北二十公里之边和区，越盟守军曾对敌展开阻击战。东京方面：“三角洲”地带法越战事正方兴未艾，越盟山地游击队正加强攻击进犯之法巡逻部队。中部地区战事亦在多处进行中。美帝助法亡越近又获一铁证，据塔斯社十二日引曼谷广播之窝尔瓦尔德报消息称：越盟抗法战争所缴获之一切武器弹药，均系美国制造。越南人民对美国当局公然支持法帝国主义弹压越南独立运动一事，深表愤慨。
