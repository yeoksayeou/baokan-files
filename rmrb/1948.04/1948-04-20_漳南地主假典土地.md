　　【Zhangnan News】At the second meeting of the Zhangnan Land Reform Work Group, an inspection was made of the local land issue: When work began, everyone thought that the land in Zhangnan had already been equally distributed, with differences only in quality. However, recently in Liuzhuangying and Xizhangzhuang, it was discovered that the landlord class had dispersed large amounts of land in the gap when the enemy and stubborn elements had just retreated. There were false mortgages and false sales, with nominal mortgages and covert rentals, and the land rights were actually still in the hands of the landlords. Most of the fifty tenant households in Liuzhuangying were afraid to say that they were tilling the landlord's land. In Xizhangzhuang, large landlord households had no less than two qing to one qing and fifty mu of land before the struggle, but by the time of the struggle, they had only left dozens of mu. All forty-two tenant households were farming mortgaged land. Zhang Dianxing's family had fifty mu of land, all of which was mortgaged land. In addition, there were four tenant households, and the landlord gave them the land, but in reality, he still rented it out. There are many similar problems. The masses now have two thoughts: one is that the land above our heads and under our feet belongs to the landlords, and what will happen if the landlords want to take back the land after three years of cultivation, so they are not at ease with production; the other is that, even if the Eighth Route Army is here, who knows, if the world changes, even the distribution may not be guaranteed. Based on this situation, it can be seen that the masses' ideological awareness is very poor, and deeply mobilizing them ideologically to solve the land ownership issue is a major problem.

　　漳南地主假典土地
    【漳南消息】漳南土改工作团二次碰头会上，对当地土地问题作了检查：开始工作时大家以为漳南土地已经平均，只在质量上的差别。但最近在刘庄营、西张庄发现地主阶级在敌顽刚退走的空隙中，把土地大量分散。有假典假卖明典暗租，地权实际上仍在地主手中。刘庄营五十户佃户，大部典种地主地不敢说出来。西张庄大户地主在斗争前每户不下两顷到一顷五十亩，到斗争时都只丢下几十亩了，四十二户佃户完全种的典地。张殿兴家有地五十亩，完全是典当地，另有四个佃户，地主就把地给了他，实际还出租子。类似这样问题很多。群众现在有两个思想，一个咱头顶的脚踏的都是地主的，种够三年地主要抽地怎办，生产不安心；另一个是说，八路军在这里怎也中，天变了就是分配上也不保险。根据这样情况，可知群众思想觉悟很差，深入从思想发动，解决土地地权问题是个很大问题。
