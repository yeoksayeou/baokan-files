Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 23rd: U.S. Imperialist Ambassador to Nanjing, Leighton Stuart, and the head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, David Barr, flew to Guangdong on the 8th for an "inspection," and on the 12th, together with the bandit Song Ziwen, made their first "inspection" of Hainan Island. Stuart flew back to Nanjing on the 15th. Stuart's trip to South China was extremely secretive. He "refused to discuss the purpose of his visit, first and foremost refusing to meet with any reporters." However, according to various sources, in addition to engaging in a despicable political conspiracy, and rumors of some connection with He Yingqin's sudden return to the country from the United States, Stuart and Barr have also completed a sinful deal, namely, confirming the so-called "final plan for aiding South China" (United Press) to enslave South China with the bandit Song. In recent traitorous transactions, the Chiang bandit regime agreed to American "supervision of South China" as a condition for obtaining $463 million in "aid" from the U.S. imperialists. The Chiang bandit's Central News Agency admitted in a Guangzhou dispatch on the 10th that Stuart had a "secret talk" with Song Ziwen after arriving in Guangzhou. According to a Guangzhou dispatch from United Press on the 12th, in addition to "inspecting the military and political situation here," Stuart and others also planned to use Hainan Island as a training base for Chiang bandit land forces and a U.S. imperialist naval base. According to a Hong Kong dispatch from United Press on the 15th, Stuart and Barr returned fully loaded, having "obtained detailed plans for 'suppressing the Communists' in Guangdong, as well as 'restoring transportation' and 'reviving' agriculture and industry," and a plan for "developing" the industry of Hainan Island. It is reported that a large pile of materials was packed into three additional luggage bags. The above news shows that the U.S. imperialists are preparing to directly participate in the civil war in South China and implement comprehensive enslavement of the people of South China. Since Wei Demai's (Wedemeyer) visit to China for "investigation" last July and August and Song Ziwen's appointment as Chairman of Guangdong Province by the Chiang bandit regime in September, the U.S. imperialists have gradually linked the five provinces of South China, including Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian, with Taiwan, making them a military and economic base for U.S. imperialism's direct control to aid Chiang in his aggression against China. Recently, newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas have called Song's rule in South China under the protection of the U.S. imperialists a "small central government." It is widely believed that the establishment of the U.S.'s "final plan" for "supervising South China" will mark the further "specialization" of South China, making the entire South China a colony of U.S. imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th: According to various sources, the U.S. imperialists' military aggression against South China is actively underway. A U.S. military advisory group led by Kaiser, the head of the U.S. military aid to Chiang's army group, arrived in Guangzhou from Nanjing via Taiwan on the 18th to "inspect military equipment in South China." "In view of Stuart and Barr's recent 'visit,' their trip is considered to be the most meaningful" (United Press). Concurrently with Kaiser's arrival in Guangzhou, Hong Kong newspapers revealed that the U.S. imperialists have obtained Yulin Port on Hainan Island from the Chiang bandit regime as a new naval base, which will be jointly garrisoned by the U.S. imperialists and the Chiang bandits, just like Qingdao. Gui Yongqing, acting commander-in-chief of the Chiang bandit's Ministry of National Defense Navy, recently inspected the port. Furthermore, it is reported that in order to comply with the Wei Demai (Wedemeyer) plan, the main highways from Guangzhou to Fuzhou and from Guangzhou to Zhanjiang (i.e., Guangzhou Bay) have already been under construction. Once these two main lines are completed, the U.S. imperialists' military aggression bases in South China and Taiwan will be linked together. Also, Admiral Griffin, commander of the U.S. Navy in Japan, and Admiral Badger, commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, arrived in Nanjing on the 20th via Shanghai to "visit" the traitorous head Jiang Jieshi.

    司徒诡秘“访”广东
    加紧策动奴役华南
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】美帝驻南京大使司徒雷登与美军顾问团团长巴大维，八日由南京飞广东“视察”，并于十二日偕宋匪子文首次“视察”海南岛，司徒已于十五日飞返南京。司徒此次华南之行，极为诡秘，他“拒绝讨论访问目的，首先是根本拒见任何记者。”但据各方消息，司徒及巴大维除进行某项卑鄙之政治阴谋，并传闻与何应钦之突然由美返国有某种关联外，且已完成一项罪恶买卖，即与宋贼确定了奴役华南的所谓“援助华南的最后计划”（合众社）。蒋匪在最近卖国交易中，曾以答应美国“监督华南”作为换取美帝给蒋四亿六千三百万美元“援助”的条件之一。蒋匪中央社十日广州电曾供认：司徒抵广州后曾与宋子文“密谈”。据合众社广州十二日电透露，司徒等此次“访问”，除“视察此间军事与政治情况”外，并拟将海南岛作为训练蒋匪陆军根据地与美帝海军根据地。另据合众社十五日香港电报导，司徒及巴大维此行，已满载而归，他“已获得广东“剿共”以及“恢复交通”、“复兴”农工业的详细计划，并得到关于“开发”海南岛工业的计划。据悉：大堆的材料又另外装了三个行李袋。上述消息显示美帝正准备直接参与华南内战，并对华南人民实行全面奴役。自去年七、八月魏德迈来华“考察”及九月宋匪子文出任蒋匪广东省主席以来，美帝即逐步使华南湘、赣、桂、粤、闽等五省与台湾连系起来，成为美帝国主义直接控制的援蒋侵华军事经济基地。最近蒋区报纸已把美帝卵翼下宋匪在华南的统治，称为“小中央”。众信美国“监督华南”“最后计划”之订立，将标志华南进一步的“特殊化”，使整个华南沦为美帝的殖民地。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据各方消息：美帝国主义对华南的军事侵略正积极进行中，美军援蒋顾问团陆军组长凯塞尔率领下的美军事顾问团一行已于十八日由南京经台湾抵达广州，“视察华南军事设备”，“鉴于司徒、巴大维最近之‘访问’，彼等此行被认为最有意义”（合众社）。与凯塞尔抵广州同时，据香港报纸披露，美帝国主义已由蒋匪手中取得海南岛的榆林港作为新的海军基地，该基地将一如青岛由美帝与蒋匪共同驻扎，蒋匪国防部海军代总司令桂永清最近曾视察该港。另悉：蒋匪为遵行魏德迈计划，由广州至福州与由广州至湛江（即广州湾）的公路干线业已施工。此两干线一旦完成，则美帝在华南及台湾的军事侵略基地将联成一片。又讯：美国驻日海军司令葛利芬偕同美西太平洋舰队司令白吉尔已于二十日经上海抵达南京，“访问”卖国贼头子蒋介石。
