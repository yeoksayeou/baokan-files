　　Shouyang Launches Mass Guerrilla Warfare
　　Combining Landmines and Sniper Fire to Counter Yan Bandit Grain Robbery

　　[Report from our newspaper in Taihang] The militia and masses in the border regions of Shouyang's First and Fourth Districts are bravely resisting enemy grain robbery, overcoming disasters, and protecting spring plowing production in their struggle against the enemy. On the 28th and 29th of last month, Yan's puppet troops launched large-scale grain robbery operations in the disaster-stricken areas of Shouyang's First and Fourth Districts. Twenty-one administrative villages in the two districts, except for Yanjiagang, were harassed by the enemy. Our battalion soldiers and militia immediately divided up to intercept the enemy, and the cadres in each village actively led the masses to fight against the enemy, launching mass guerrilla warfare. The militia in the First District universally engaged the enemy, using landmines and sniper fire to strike back, trapping the enemy in a mass guerrilla fire net. The militia in ＠Yu village, with four guns, persisted in fighting the enemy attacking their village for 20 minutes, covering the safe transfer of livestock and other items by the masses. The village chiefs of Shiquan and Yaming villages also resettled the transferred masses. Comrade Guo Bing'en, Director of the Zhanghanhe Armed Forces Committee, led twelve militiamen, maneuvering everywhere to engage the enemy. During a personal reconnaissance, he was captured by the enemy, but he threw his gun into a ditch, forcefully pushed the enemy away, and ran back. He was captured again during a second reconnaissance but escaped again. Although he was captured three times in a row, he bravely escaped each time using his ingenuity. Li ××, the militia squad leader of Puyang, who was wounded last year, personally led the battle against the enemy, despite his injury, throwing two hand grenades into the enemy's ranks. Due to the unity of cadres and the masses and mutual support between villages, the Yan bandit's conspiracy to soften the masses and attack the cadres also suffered a fatal blow. When the enemy captured six villagers from Puyang, they stubbornly asked where the cadres were. The masses consistently replied, "The Eighth Route Army doesn't use cadres now; they discuss matters with the masses," leaving the enemy helpless. An old lady from Shiquan, Wu ××, even propagated the land law to disintegrate Yan's puppet soldiers. When the Yan bandits arrived in the village, she didn't have time to run. Seeing two soldiers she knew who were serving in Yan's army, she persuaded them, "You should go home quickly. The government will treat you leniently and won't kill you. With the land law, everyone can have a share." The two didn't believe her, but after the old lady repeatedly explained it to them, the two puppet soldiers believed her and agreed to mobilize several more people to return and cultivate the land. One puppet soldier from Leijiazhai also defected back from Yuci. Currently, the masses in the First and Fourth Districts are improving their organization, strengthening combat and political offense, and persisting in spring plowing production in the area.

　　寿阳开展群众游击战
  　地雷冷枪结合反击阎匪抢粮
    【本报太行讯】寿阳边地一、四区民兵及群众英勇反敌抢粮，在与敌进行斗争中克服灾荒保卫春耕生产。阎伪军于上月二十八、九两日，先后向我寿阳边地一、四区灾荒区进行大规模的抢粮。两个区共二十一个行政村，除阎家庄外，各村均被敌人窜扰。我营兵与民兵当即分头阻击敌人，各村的干部并积极领导群众向敌进行斗争，展开了群众性的游击战。一区的民兵普遍打响，以地雷冷枪回击敌人，陷敌于群众性的游击火网内。＠峪村民兵以四支枪与向该村进攻之敌坚持战斗廿分钟，掩护群众将牲口等安全转移出来，石泉、鸦鸣村长并将转移出来的群众加以安置。张韩河武委会主任郭丙恩同志带着十二个民兵，到处与敌周旋，在亲自侦察中，被敌捉住，他便把枪抛在沟内，用力将敌人推开跑回，二次侦察中被敌捉住又跑出，虽连续被敌捕住三次，亦都在他的智谋下英勇脱险。普烟民兵班长李××去年挂了彩，这次亲自带伤与敌搏斗，将两个手榴弹投入敌阵。由于干群团结及各村相互策应，阎匪软化群众打击干部的阴谋亦遭到了致命的打击。敌人捉住普烟六个老乡，硬问干部在哪哩，群众即一直回答：“现在八路军不用干部，有事就和群众商量”，弄的敌人也没办法。石泉一个老太太吴××更宣传土地法瓦解阎伪军士兵。当阎匪到村中时，她因来不及跑，见到她认识的两个在阎方当兵的，便向他劝说：“你们快回家吧，政府优待不杀，有了土地法，人人可以有一份。”那二人不信，经老太太反复向他解释，那两个伪军才信了，并答应再动员几个人回来种地。雷家寨也从榆次瓦解回来一个伪军。现一、四区的群众正在健全组织，加强作战与政攻，坚持该地区的春耕生产。
