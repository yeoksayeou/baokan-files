　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th: The Bohai region is fully launching its spring plowing production and disaster relief campaign. The Bohai Administrative Office and Military Region first issued a joint emergency mobilization proclamation for spring plowing, stipulating temporary handling principles for land and wasteland where land ownership has not yet been determined, methods for cultivating and planting land for military families, families of revolutionary martyrs, and civilian laborers who lack labor, and for managing land for households that have moved away. They also called on government organs and troops to help the masses with spring plowing with manpower and livestock. The Bohai Daily also published an editorial calling for building a prosperous life through production, providing disaster relief, and supporting the front. Currently, the Bohai Daily, East China Military and Political University, and other government organs are actively helping the local masses transport manure with manpower and horses. The Dezhou Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce Transportation Team has lent 500 head of livestock to the masses to reclaim wasteland and cultivate land. The Beihai Bank has also decided to release another 330 million yuan in Beihai currency and 400,000 jin of wheat for spring plowing loans to help the masses in areas affected by drought and floods solve production difficulties. Since borrowing more than 466,600 jin of wheat seeds and more than 1 million jin of relief grain before the new year, disaster-stricken people in Boxing County have vigorously engaged in spring plowing. Currently, the county has planted more than 44,600 mu of spring wheat. The Bohai Cooperative Promotion Agency has developed the woolen textile industry in Huimin City, and has organized more than 2,300 women to spin and weave. The Cangshi Democratic Government has lent nearly 300 spinning wheels and more than 2,000 jin of cotton to help poor women develop spinning and weaving. The Beihai Bank has purchased 39,000 chi of homespun cloth in Boxing County.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th: The Jinan County Democratic Government in the Bohai Region, in order to help the masses in the North and South Jianhe River flood areas with spring plowing production, after issuing 170,000 jin of relief grain and lending 70,000 jin of wheat seeds in January, has also issued 15 million yuan in Beihai currency for spring plowing loans and a large amount of cotton loans to support sideline production. The Bohai Administrative Office has also allocated 2 million jin of grain to provide work relief and build water conservancy projects. The county is now establishing a water conservancy committee to actively prepare for construction.
