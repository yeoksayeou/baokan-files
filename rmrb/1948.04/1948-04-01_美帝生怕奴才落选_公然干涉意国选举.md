Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. Combined reports: As the date of the Italian election approaches, the fear of the reactionary US-Italian authorities intensifies, and the interference of US imperialism in the Italian election becomes more frantic and despicable. Recently, Wall Street's mouthpiece, the "Business Week," frankly revealed this concern. It said: "If the future Italian election fails (referring to the failure of the people's enemies), the West will lose Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East." Therefore, it frantically shouted that "the United States must use political and economic means to influence Italy."

Wall Street's puppet, De Gasperi, placed all his hopes on "US aid." On the 17th, De Gasperi hysterically appealed to Truman for "military guarantees" for his election. On the same day, Truman delivered a shameless speech of interference in the US Congress. On the 19th, Marshall again threatened the Italian people with the cancellation of "aid," demanding that they elect the current Italian government favored by Washington.

On the other hand, Colonel Poletti, the former head of the US military government in Rome, who went to Italy earlier this month on a "special mission" from US imperialism, acted as if he were the master of Italy, planning De Gasperi's election campaign. Recently, the US ship "Mount McKinley" patrolled the Mediterranean, preparing to "land in the event of unrest." It is believed that the shameless provocations carried out by the reactionaries against the People's Democratic Front in various parts of Italy are related to this US imperialist conspiracy.

Under the direction of US imperialism, De Gasperi's police and cavalry, composed of fascists, have been expanded to 100,000 men each and armed with American tanks and machine guns to carry out election intimidation. At the same time, the reactionary forces of the Vatican are also threatening to excommunicate voters who oppose the Christian Democratic Party.

Simultaneous with armed intimidation, US imperialism has also thrown out bait to the Italian people. On the 17th, US imperialism returned 29 merchant ships originally obtained from Italy to Italy. On the 20th, the United States, Britain, and France proposed to hand over the port of Trieste to Italy. At the same time, the US State Department forced Italian-Americans to write 100,000 letters to their relatives and friends in Italy, trying to increase De Gasperi's chips on the gambling table with "chauvinistic sentiments" (L'Humanité).

But all this still does not make them feel confident of success. Recently, the US Ambassador to Italy, Dunn, disregarding his status as an ambassador, personally participated in the Italian election, "running from city to city, busily telling the Italian people to vote for De Gasperi" (TASS). The US ambassador's desperate move broke the record in the history of world diplomacy. Italian democrats suspect that US imperialism has become nervous due to the strength of the Italian democratic forces.

However, these despicable actions, which extremely insult the national dignity of the Italian people, have greatly angered the Italian people, and even caused some Italian industrialists with national consciousness to turn to donating money to the People's Democratic Front for the election campaign (Associated Press). When De Gasperi delivered a hoarse speech in Bologna, "the audience repeatedly interrupted him with sharp protests, opposing his slander against democratic countries. When he finished his speech, the whole audience erupted in boos" (TASS, 22nd), reflecting how the People's Democratic Front has won the support of the broad masses of the Italian people.

### 美帝生怕奴才落选  公然干涉意国选举

　　美帝生怕奴才落选
    公然干涉意国选举
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】综合报导：意大利大选的日子愈逼近，美意反动当局的恐惧愈烈，而美帝干涉意大选亦愈疯狂而鄙野。最近华尔街的喉舌“商业周刊”坦白地吐出了这个心事。它说：“假使意国未来选举失败了（按指人民的敌人失败了），西方就要失掉希、土及中东。”因此狂叫“美国必须以政治及经济手段来影响意大利。”华尔街的傀儡加斯贝利则更将一切希望寄托于“美援”。十七日，加斯贝利歇斯的里地向杜鲁门急呼对其选举加以“军事保证”。同日，杜鲁门在美国会发表了无耻的干涉演说。十九日，马歇尔再以取消“援助”来威胁意人民，要他们选举华盛顿所喜欢的意国现政府。另一方面，早在本月初便奉美帝“特殊使命”赴意的前任美驻罗马军政府首脑波勒提上校，俨然以主人翁身份在意国为加斯贝利策划竞选事宜。最近，美舰“美孟达尼”号则往返巡逻于地中海，准备“一有骚乱就可能实行登陆。”众信，目前在意各地由反动派向人民民主阵线大打出手实行无耻挑衅的丑剧，即与美帝此种阴谋有关。在美帝导演下，加斯贝利的由法西斯分子组成的警察及骑警已各扩大到十万人，并以美国坦克及机枪武装起来，实行选举恫吓。同时，梵蒂冈反动势力也以开除反对基督教民主党的选民教籍进行威胁。与武装恫吓同时，美帝又向意人民放下了钓饵。十七日，美帝将原来得自意国二十九艘商船交还意大利。二十日美英法建议将的港交给意大利。同时，美国务院更强迫意籍美人写十万封信给他们在意国的亲友，力图以“沙文主义感情”（人道报）来增加加斯贝利赌桌上的筹码。但是这一切仍不能使他们觉得有成功的把握。最近美驻意大使邓纳已顾不得大使的身份，竟亲自参加意国竞选，“从这个城市跑到那个城市，忙个不休，叫意人民投票选举加斯贝利。”（塔斯社）。美大使此种情急之举实打破世界外交史的记录，意民主人士咸怀疑美帝已为意民主力量的强大而吓得神经失常了。但是这种种极端侮辱意国人民民族尊严的卑鄙举劲，大大激怒了意国人民，甚至使某些有民族意识的意工业家，也转而以金钱捐助人民民主阵线进行竞选了（合众社）。当加斯贝利在波伦亚发表声嘶力竭的演说时，“听众屡次用尖锐的抗议打断他，反对他对民主国家的诽谤。他演说完毕，全场涌起一片嘘声。”（塔斯社二十二日电）反映了人民民主阵线已如何赢得了意国广大人民的拥护。
