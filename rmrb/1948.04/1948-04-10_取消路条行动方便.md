　　Cancellation of Travel Permit Makes Movement Convenient
    The Border Region Government issued a notice to all levels of government in the region on April 5th, announcing that travel permits are completely abolished within the border region. From now on, whether going out, visiting relatives, or doing business, people can travel freely without travel permits.

    Why are travel permits being abolished? The notice also clearly states: In the past, when the enemy was attacking us, the environment in the border region was not peaceful, so the implementation of travel permits to check for spies played a role in protecting our liberated areas. Now, the People's Liberation Army is attacking the enemy, and our border region has become a unified whole. Travel permits no longer serve a purpose. On the contrary, in some places, issuing travel permits caused a lot of trouble for our people. For example, a small merchant in Handan was unable to go out and peddle his goods because he couldn't obtain a travel permit. With this change, it will be convenient for our people to travel and do business. Let's all work hard in production and build our good border region.

### 取消路条行动方便

　　取消路条行动方便
    边府在四月五号通令全区各级政府，边区境内一律取消路条，以后不管出门、走亲戚、作买卖，都可以自由来往不要路条。
    为啥取消路条呢？通令上也说的很明白：过去敌人向咱进攻，边区环境不平静，所以实行路条盘查奸特，对保护咱解放区起了作用；现在是解放军向敌人进攻了，咱边区内部也已联成一片，路条就没有作用了。反而有些地方因开路条，还给咱老百姓很大麻烦。如邯郸一个小商人，因开不上路条，就不能出去担挑作买卖。这一来，咱老百姓来往买卖可方便了。大家好好生产，建设咱的好边区。
