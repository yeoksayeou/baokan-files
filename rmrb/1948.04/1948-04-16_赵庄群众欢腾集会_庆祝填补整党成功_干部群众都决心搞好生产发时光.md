　　[Our Dispatch] Zhao Village held a mass rally on the evening of April 13th to celebrate the victorious completion of democratic land reform and Party rectification. After dinner, members of the poor peasant league, agricultural association, village government, and the Communist Youth League were busy preparing the venue. A group of farmers, just back from the fields, started beating the gongs and drums. Before it was fully dark, some people had already finished their meals and were heading to the meeting place in twos and threes. At the entrance to the venue, two large red flags fluttered in the wind, and two large red palace lanterns with the words "Unity" and "Democracy" were swaying, dimly illuminating the red posters on the walls on both sides, which displayed the results of land redistribution and acknowledgments of land donations from middle peasants. Those who had their land shortages filled, those whose class status was corrected, new and old middle peasants, and Party cadres who had undergone Party rectification and study, all entered the venue with joy, standing together without distinction, filled with a new atmosphere of harmony and cooperation.

　　After the chairman announced the opening of the meeting, the new chairman of the agricultural association, Zhao Fushan, reported on the process of land redistribution. Comrade Zhao Shuli from the work team added that the implementation of the Land Law could be considered complete today, but there might still be some loose ends. For example, he himself saw that there was a man named Jin Bingwu who everyone said was from a rich peasant background, didn't work hard, was given less land and more floating wealth, but in the end, he didn't receive more floating wealth, and he still had a land shortage. If implementing the Land Law leaves a land shortage, all members of the Zhao Village Poor Peasants League and Agricultural Association would be responsible, and therefore, we must find a way to inspect and resolve it. Comrade Lao Wang from the work team, representing the higher-level Party, announced the disciplinary actions against Party members, the admission of new Party members, and a self-criticism. First, Lao Wang expressed gratitude to the entire Zhao Village community, thanking them for their enthusiastic help in Party rectification, which allowed Party members to correct their mistakes and become good long-term workers for the people. He said: The Communist Party is different from other parties, not afraid of being rectified, and openly asks the masses to help with rectification. The spirit of "washing the face with black" in the past was not good, but this time the spirit is completely different. In three months, the Party members of the Zhao Village branch, with the help of the masses, have been transformed well, and now the higher-level Party is confident in their ability to lead the work in Zhao Village. However, some Party members had made mistakes in the past and should be appropriately punished to educate them to thoroughly correct themselves. He then announced the names of eleven Party members who had been disciplined, as well as the severity and nature of their mistakes and the decisions made. (Of the forty Party members in the branch, eleven were disciplined, including: one expelled from the Party, one placed on probation within the Party, three given public warnings, two given private warnings, and four given private admonishments.) At the same time, he thanked everyone for trusting the Communist Party, supporting the Communist Party, and recommending the people they most supported to the Communist Party, asking the Party to admit them as members. Among the 131 people recommended by the masses, the branch carefully studied and finally decided to admit 24 people first. After individual interviews, 22 of them with high levels of awareness have asked the Party to admit them as members. The masses support them, and the Party welcomes them. Secondly, he conducted a self-criticism, saying: Just now, we asked everyone to give their opinions to the work team, and everyone was very polite. We hope that you can offer them at any time. Under the assistance of the entire Zhao Village community, although this work has been basically successful, because we lack experience and are crossing the river by feeling for stones, we inevitably have some shortcomings. The biggest problem was the detours we took in organizing the Poor Peasants League, establishing the Agricultural Association, and electing the village government, which delayed everyone for almost half a month.

　　At the meeting, the masses unanimously agreed to use 200 catties of rice and 30 towels from the fruits of the Agricultural Association's struggle to reward dozens of model workers in this village (including mass cadres) in this land redistribution work. At the same time, they launched criticisms against the bad phenomenon of a few people hindering democratic life. When the criticism reached Meng Nuozi and @Shanlin, the masses nodded in agreement and were very satisfied. Meng Nuozi is a retired soldier who participated in the army and received education from the Communist Party's Eighth Route Army. In theory, he should have a higher level of awareness than the masses, but on the contrary, he only spread rumors in the village. During this land redistribution, in order to get more things, he competed with his brother's wife for his daughter and specifically went to Wuan City to buy a little girl to count as a family member. @Shanlin is said to be a platoon leader of a certain unit, who has no discharge certificate and does not return to the team, causing trouble in the village. He was the one who suggested Meng Nuozi's snatching of the girl. The special thoughts of some military dependents were also criticized at the meeting. The masses said that this is the real democracy, distinguishing clearly between good and bad. Whoever serves everyone well will be rewarded, and whoever only cares about his own interests and harms everyone will be criticized. From now on, the work of Zhao Village Street will only go upwards, and it must never fall downwards. In order to take care of the overall situation and strengthen the leadership of the Agricultural Association, ten formal members and three alternate members of the Agricultural Association were re-elected.

　　Finally, the three major policies proposed by the work team were unanimously adopted: First, mutual aid and cooperation to boost production; Second, emphasize unity and regularly criticize and educate incorrect opinions; Third, consolidate the democratic life and democratic system that has been established, and establish some rules. Near the end of the meeting, Village Government Chairman Jin Yintai and representatives of the masses spoke one after another, saying: We must follow Chairman Mao's line to the end, and cooperate with each other to make the most of our time. Communist Youth League Chairman Yang Xiangbao also called on all young people to play a model role in spring plowing and production.

　　The meeting adjourned late at night. The next day at dawn, the whole village began producing. Everyone ate their meals early, those who drove donkeys drove donkeys, those who carried plows carried plows, and they all went to the fields to plant cotton.

　　赵庄群众欢腾集会
  　庆祝填补整党成功
    干部群众都决心搞好生产发时光
    【本报消息】四月十三日黄昏，赵庄举行庆祝民主整党、民主填补胜利完成的群众大会，吃罢晚饭贫农团委员、农会委员、村政府委员和青年团员们，东奔西跑，忙着布置会场。一伙农民刚从地里回来，便把锣鼓家具打起来了。天还没黑齐，有些人已经吃罢饭了，三个两个往会场里走。会场门口两面大红旗，迎风飘拂，两个写着“团结”“民主”四个字的大红宫灯，也在幌荡着，把左右两边墙壁上张贴着抽补结果和鸣谢部分中农献地的红榜，照得隐约可辨。填补了的窟窿户、订正成份的错斗户，新、老中农，以及经过整党学习的党员干部，个个都喜气洋洋地走进会场，不分彼此地挤着站在一块，充满和衷共济的新气象。
    主席宣布开会以后，新农会主席赵伏山报告抽补经过，工作组赵树理同志补充，他说：执行土地法的工作今天算完成了，但是可能还留下一点尾巴。比如，他自己就看到有个叫靳炳五的，原先大家说他是个富农出身，劳动不好，少补地多分浮财，后来浮财也没多给，地也没有补，还是个窟窿户。实行罢土地法，要留下窟窿，咱们赵庄全体贫农团团员、农会会员都得负责，因此一定想法检查解决。工作组老王同志代表上级党，宣布党员处分，吸收新党员情形和进行自我检讨。首先，老王向赵庄村全体群众表示感谢，感谢他们热心帮助整党，使党员改正错误，成为人民的好长工。他说：共产党和别的党不一样，不怕整，而且公开请群众帮助整。过去“洗脸擦黑”没闹好，这次的精神都完全不一样。三个月，赵庄支部党员在群众帮助下，改造得不错，现在上级党已经放心让他们领导赵庄工作。但有一部分党员过去有错误，要受适当处分，教育他们彻底改好。接着即逐个宣布十一个受处分党员名字，以及他们犯错误的轻重性质和处分的决定。（支部共有四十个党员，受处分的十一人中，计：开除党籍者一人，留党察看者一人，当众警告者三人，当面警告者二人，当面劝告者四人。）同时感谢大家，相信共产党，拥护共产党，把自己最拥戴的人推荐给共产党，请党吸收他们为党员。在群众推荐的一百三十一个人当中，经支部慎重研究，最后决定先吸收二十四人，经过个别谈话，现在已有二十二个觉悟高的，要求党吸收他为党员。群众拥护，党也很欢迎他们的。其次，进行自我检讨说：刚才请大家向工作组提意见，大家都很客气，希望下去随时都可以提，工作组在赵庄全体群众帮助下，这段工作虽然基本上成功了，但是因为没经验，摸着石头过河，不免有些缺点，最大的毛病是在组织贫农团到成立农会和选举村政府开始时的算帐抽补，走了两段弯路，耽误了大家几乎半个月的时间。
    会上，群众一致通过，用农会斗争果实的二百斤大米，三十条手巾，奖励这次填补工作中几十位本村模范工作者（群众干部都有）。同时，对少数人妨碍民主生活的不良现象展开了批评。批评到孟挪子、＠山林的时候，群众点头称是，十分满意。孟挪子，是个荣退军人，他曾参加军队，受过共产党八路军的教育，按道理应该比群众觉悟高；却相反，在村中光播弄是非，这次填补，为了多得东西，与兄弟媳妇抢闺女，并且专门到武安城买了个小女孩回来顶人口；＠山林据说是某部的排长，没有退伍证不归队，在村里胡闹腾，这次孟挪子抢女孩的事，他也出了主意。而某些军属的特殊思想，在会上也受到了批评。群众说，这才是真正的民主当家哩，好坏分明清清格格，谁为大家办事办得好就奖励，谁光要小心肝眼坏咱大伙的事就批评，往后咱赵庄街的工作只有往上走，绝不能往下落啦。并为了照顾全面，加强农会领导，又增选了十个农会正式委员，三个候补委员。
    最后，一致通过了工作组提出的三大方针：第一、互助合作闹生产；第二、讲团结，对某些不正确的意见，要经常批评与育教；第三、把已经建立的民主生活民主制度巩固起来，并订了些规矩。临散会，村政府主席靳银太，群众代表相继讲话说：要照毛主席路线走到底，互助生产发时光。青年团主席杨相保，并号召全体青年，在春耕生产中起模范作用。
    深夜散会，第二天拂晓，全村都生产开了，大家早早就吃罢饭，赶毛驴的赶毛驴，背犁的背犁，都往地里种棉花去了。
