Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: Delayed news: During the siege of Changchun, the People's Liberation Army, from March 25th to April 3rd, annihilated over 1,400 enemies in ten days. The West Suburb Airport, on which the enemy relied for air transport of supplies, was exposed to our artillery fire. On March 25th, at the Dafangshen Airport in the western suburbs, we destroyed two of their transport planes with artillery fire, one completely burned and the tail of the other destroyed. In order to eliminate the threat to their air transport security, the enemy, using the New 38th Division and the Provisional 56th Division of the New 7th Army, dispatched about seven battalions every day to attack us. On March 30th, the enemy who advanced to Yimazhan (25 miles west of Changchun) was driven back by our counterattack, with over 200 killed or wounded. The next day, the enemy attacked Yujiawozha, Congjialingzi, and other places in three routes but were also repelled by us. On April 3rd, the enemy's New 38th Division once again advanced towards the Sujiawozha, Sanjiawozha, and Majia Youfang line (all 35 miles west of Changchun). Under our fierce counterattack, the enemy retreated in panic. We took advantage of the victory and pursued them to Yitonghewozha and other places 25 miles away from Changchun, killing one enemy regimental and one battalion commander. The enemy fled back to Changchun in droves. According to incomplete statistics, a total of over 1,300 enemy officers and soldiers were killed or wounded in various battles, 144 enemies were captured, two 60mm mortars, eighteen light and heavy machine guns, twelve submachine guns, and over a hundred rifles and carbines were seized, along with 43,900 rounds of ammunition. Two enemy planes were destroyed.
