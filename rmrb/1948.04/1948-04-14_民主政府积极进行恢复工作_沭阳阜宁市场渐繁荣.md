Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th: The newly recovered towns of Shuyang, Funing, Juegang, and Shigang in Huazhong are rapidly restoring democratic order, and markets are becoming increasingly prosperous. In Shuyang, the city walls have been demolished and rebuilt into a city ring road more than ten meters wide. The fortifications and obstacles built by the Chiang bandits on the streets have also been completely cleared, and traffic is smooth. The democratic government has also distributed more than 21,600 catties of grain hoarded by the Chiang bandits to 3,186 poor citizens. Shops in Funing are gradually reopening. The masses in the city are spontaneously reporting hidden materials of the Chiang bandits. In Xicheng Town alone, more than 500 hu (one hu equals 25 catties) of grain from the Chiang bandits were reported, all of which were used to help the poor. Shigang, a major transportation hub for water and land in Nantong, saw a sharp decline in population during the Chiang bandits' occupation. No merchant ships could be seen at the docks, and the water pipe tobacco in a certain grocery store was still the stale stock from a year ago and had already become moldy. On the second day of liberation, villagers from the surrounding areas transported a large batch of cotton and grain to the market, and the market suddenly became active. According to a certain merchant, during the five days when the People's Liberation Army briefly recovered the town on the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month, he did more than 400,000 yuan of Huazhong currency business. During the 45 days when the Chiang bandits reoccupied it, he only sold more than 400,000 yuan of Chiang currency (equivalent to 5,000 yuan of Huazhong currency). Commerce in Juegang in Rudong is also gradually recovering. The democratic government has organized a working team of 250 people to actively carry out the recovery work in the towns.
    
Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th: Lusi Town in Nantong, one of the nine major fishing ports in the country, was recovered on the 21st of last month. The democratic government immediately distributed 200 dan of cotton as fishing loans (one dan equals 100 catties; the local area is a cotton reclamation area, and materials are calculated in terms of cotton) to support production. The fishermen were overjoyed to receive this loan, as the yellow croaker season was approaching. They repaired their boats and nets one after another, preparing to go to sea. There are four ports near the town along the 30-li Yellow Sea coast: Dayang, Changdeng, Bosui, and Sigang, which can berth more than 200 fishing boats and produce more than 100,000 dan of yellow croaker annually. After the Japanese surrender, we liberated Lusi Town, and under the support of the democratic government, fish production increased sharply. In addition to supplying the surrounding counties, most of it could also be exported, with an average profit of 50 to 60 dan of cotton per boat. Last year, on the first day of the lunar new year, the Chiang bandits invaded and carried out large-scale plundering, causing 148 fishing boats to lose more than 6,000 dan of cotton throughout the year. Many fishermen had no food or clothing and were able to maintain their lives only after the democratic government in the vast rural areas allocated 100,000 catties of grain for relief.

　　民主政府积极进行恢复工作
  　沭阳阜宁市场渐繁荣
    【新华社华东十二日电】化中新近收复的沭阳、阜宁、掘港、石港等城镇，正迅速恢复民主秩序，市场日趋繁荣。沭阳已将城垣拆除，修成了三丈多宽的环城马路。街上蒋匪所筑的工事障碍也已全部清除，车马畅通。民主政府并已将蒋匪囤粮二万一千六百多斤，发给了三千一百八十六个贫苦市民。阜宁商店陆续开市，该城群众自动检举蒋匪隐藏物资，仅城西镇就检举出蒋匪粮食五百多斛（每斛二十五斤），全部救济了贫民。南通的水陆交通重镇石港，在蒋匪占领时，人口锐减，码头上看不见一只商船，某杂货店里的水烟，还是一年前的陈货，已经发霉。解放的第二天，四乡乡民就运了一大批棉花、粮食上市，市场突趋活跃。据某商人谈：阴历腊月十五日解放军一度收复该镇的五天中，他做了华中币四十多万元生意，而在蒋匪重占的四十五天中，只卖了蒋币四十多万元（合华中币五千元）。如（皋）东掘港商业亦渐恢复。民主政府已组织了一个二百五十余人的工作队，积极进行市镇恢复工作。
    【新华社华东十一日电】全国九大渔港之一的南通吕四镇，上月二十一日收复后，民主政府即发放渔贷棉花二百担（每担百斤，当地系棉垦区，物资均以棉花计算），扶助生产。渔民们以黄花鱼汛将临，得此贷款，喜出望外，纷纷修船置网，准备下海。该地附近三十里黄海岸有大漾、长磴、泊水、泗港四个港口，可停泊渔船二百多艘，年产黄花鱼十万多担。按日寇投降后，我曾解放吕四镇，在民主政府扶植下渔产量激增，除供给附近各县外，尚可输出大部，平均每船可赚棉花五、六十担。去年旧历元旦蒋匪侵占该地，即大肆搜刮，致一百四十八艘渔船全年亏蚀六千多担棉花，许多渔民衣食无着，经坚持于广大农村的民主政府拨粮十万斤救济，始得维持生活。
