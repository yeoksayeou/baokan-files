Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th: The Bin Hai Local Armed Forces recovered Rizhao County on the 4th. The defending enemy, Chiang Kai-shek's 83rd Division, two regiments, fled by sea.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th: People's armed forces in various areas are actively launching attacks to protect the masses in spring plowing. In the eighth district of Pingyi (new county, the southern part of the original Fei County) in southern Shandong, 5,000 mu have been rushed for plowing in the past half month. The Spring Plowing Protection Committee of a certain township in this district, in conjunction with various villages, controls important mountain tops, sets up sentry posts to monitor the enemy, and militiamen carry out guerrilla activities in all directions. The entire township has rushed to plow 400 mu in ten days. In Donghai County, Bin Hai, 4,000 mu of spring wheat have been rushed to plant. The local armed forces of the county have penetrated into the enemy areas south of the Longhai Railway, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 20 enemies. In late last month, the local armed forces of Linshu (new county, the eastern part of the original Linyi) and Tancheng launched an offensive against the Yi River and Shu River, compressing the enemy to isolated strongholds such as Lijiazhuang on the Lin-Tan Highway, controlling an area of 80 li in the vicinity. The militiamen used landmines to block the edges, and the local masses took this opportunity to launch a full-scale assault and rush to plow. Under the call of "Farmers all over the world are one family, supporting the border areas is for ourselves," the masses in the hinterland of Ju (County) South formed a plowing team with more than a hundred head of livestock, brought their own supplies, and set off to the border areas of Linyi on the 28th of last month to help rush to plow. At the same time, the local armed forces of Linyi and Yi (Shui) South launched an attack on Tangtou area northeast of Linyi, capturing more than 20 local bandits. The militiamen patrolled and guarded, and the rear troops also helped to deliver manure. It is expected that in the areas under our control, most of the rushing plowing can be completed in six or seven days.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th: The local armed forces in northern Si (Shui) in southern Shandong are active in the border areas, combating enemy and bandit grain robbery. From March 19th to 25th, they repelled Chiang Kai-shek bandits who attempted to rob grain in Longwangtao, Wangjialing, North and South Ridge and other places, annihilating more than 120 enemies, seizing one machine gun, 111 rifles and pistols, and more than 5,500 rounds of ammunition, and recovered more than 10,000 jin of grain, which has been distributed to relieve the victims of the disaster.
