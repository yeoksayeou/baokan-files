Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. New York dispatch: American democratic youth enthusiastically respond to the "China Week" movement against aiding Chiang. An anti-aid-Chiang demonstration, hosted by the American Democratic Youth Association and the Students for Wallace Committee, was held at Columbia University on the 8th. The masses who attended eagerly read the leaflets against American imperialism's aid to Chiang distributed by the conference. The conference was filled with righteous indignation at the dictator Chiang Kai-shek and the US government's current sinful policy of aiding Chiang, and filled with enthusiasm for supporting the Chinese people's democratic struggle. The famous American journalist Israel Epstein delivered a speech to the conference entitled "The New China in Birth." After pointing out that the so-called "aid to China" by the United States is a shameless interference in China's internal affairs, Epstein emphasized: The new China has already been born, and 160 million people are already living under the democratic government of the Liberated Areas. It possesses an army supported by the people, an army that cannot be defeated.
