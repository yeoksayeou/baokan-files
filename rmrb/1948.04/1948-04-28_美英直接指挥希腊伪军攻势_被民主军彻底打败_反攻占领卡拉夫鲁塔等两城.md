Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Radio Free Greece broadcast: The Greek Democratic Army has completely defeated the puppet army offensive directly commanded by the US and British in several regions, launched a powerful offensive, and occupied two cities. On the night of the 6th, a unit of the Democratic Army attacked the city of Farsala in central Greece, subdued the enemy's superior forces, stormed into the city, and engaged in street fighting, destroying the city's police station and annihilating the constables and officers hiding inside. The Democratic Army, which attacked Kalavryta in the northern Peloponnese on the 11th at dawn, defeated a powerful puppet army after hours of fierce fighting and entered the city. According to preliminary statistics, the battle killed or wounded 248 enemy soldiers, captured 207 enemy officers and soldiers, and seized 5 cannons, 14 heavy machine guns, 22 light machine guns, and 300 rifles. In addition, the Democratic Army launched an offensive in the Drama region of northern Thrace and reoccupied the city of Didymoteicho on the Greek-Turkish border.

Another dispatch: According to the US "Aid to Greece" delegation, the Greek puppet army had received 15,000 tons of US military supplies by the end of March. In one battle in the Kruševo region alone, 130 US military officers and 30 British military officers participated in the puppet army's operations.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Sofia Dispatch: After the so-called "Balkan Committee" under the manipulation of US imperialism arrived in Greece, the Greek puppet government army's harassment of the Bulgarian-Albanian border became even more rampant, and the people of Bulgaria and Albania were deeply angered by this. On the 4th of this month, 100 Greek puppet soldiers attacked the Bulgarian border and abducted three sentries. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kolarov telegraphed UN Secretary-General Lie, protesting to the Greek puppet side, demanding the immediate release of the three sentries and guaranteeing that similar incidents would not occur in the future. A mass meeting of 100,000 people was held in the Bulgarian capital on the 12th to protest the provocative actions of the Greek puppet army. The Albanian Foreign Ministry announced on the 9th of last month that there were more than 440 incidents of Greek troops invading the Albanian border, 99 of which occurred after the "Balkan Committee" arrived in Greece. From the 20th of last month to the 5th of this month, it invaded Albanian territory 24 more times. The Albanian Foreign Ministry has filed five complaints with the United Nations against the Greek puppet government for this reason. The Albanian Foreign Minister reiterated in a letter to Lie on the 10th that it rejected the attitude of the UN "Balkan Committee." At the same time, the Albanian border guards resolutely struck back against the Greek puppet troops who crossed the border.

    美英直接指挥希腊伪军攻势
    被民主军彻底打败
    反攻占领卡拉夫鲁塔等两城
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】自由希腊电台广播：希民主军在若干地区已彻底击败美英直接指挥的伪军攻势，并发动强大的进攻，并攻占两城。六日夜晚，民主军一部进攻希腊中部的发尔沙罗斯城，制服敌人的优势兵力，袭入城内，进行巷战，摧毁了该城警察局，尽歼躲在局内的宪兵与官佐。十一日拂晓进攻摩里亚半岛北部卡拉夫鲁塔的民主军，曾以持续几小时的激战，击溃强大伪军，进驻该城。据初步统计，该役毙伤敌二四八人，俘敌官兵两百零七人，缴获炮五门，重机枪十四挺，手提机枪二十二挺，步枪三百支。此外，民主军在色雷斯北部德拉马区发动攻势，并再度攻占希土边界上的底底姆梯康城。
    另讯：据美“援希”代表团自供：截至三月底，希伪陆军已收到美军火一万五千吨。仅在克鲁西亚地区的一次战斗中，就有一百三十名美军官和三十名英军官参加伪军作战。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】索非亚讯：在美帝操纵下的所谓“巴尔干委员会”到希后，希腊伪政府军对保阿边界的侵扰更形猖獗，保、阿两国人民对此深为愤怒。本月四日，希伪军一百名袭击保加利亚边界，劫走三名哨兵。保外长科拉罗夫特致电联合国秘书长莱氏，向希伪方抗议，要求立即释放该三名哨兵，并保证此后不再发生类似事件。保首都于十二日举行十万人大会，抗议希伪军的挑衅行为。阿尔巴尼亚外交部上月九日宣布，希军侵犯阿边界事件达四百四十次以上，其中九十九件是“巴尔干委员会”到希后发生的。从上月二十日到本月五日，又侵犯阿境二十四次。阿外部为此曾五度向联合国控诉希伪政府，阿外长十日致莱氏函中，重申否认联合国“巴尔干委员会”的态度，同时，阿边防军对越界希伪军曾坚决予以痛击。
