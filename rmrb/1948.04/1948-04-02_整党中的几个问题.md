Editor's Note: The Changzhi County Committee has promptly summarized and studied some of their experiences and problems in the Party rectification democratic movement and put them forward for everyone to study, which is very good. In this major and serious movement, many new problems and experiences must be promptly presented for exchange and study. We hope that comrades participating in the actual movement can frequently write about the experiences and problems in their work.

　　(1) In the recent ten days or so, leaders in various villages have had two different understandings of Party rectification democratic issues, resulting in two different outcomes. One is: starting from the specific situation, distinguishing between the good and bad of the branch's members, rectifying the Party with the attitude of treating illnesses and saving people to correct mistakes, while letting the masses criticize the branch members' mistakes and shortcomings to their heart's content. The result is that the branch's prestige among the masses has increased, and most of the Party members have consciously reflected on their mistakes, and the Party rectification democratic movement has developed normally. The other is: adopting an attitude of disgust and rejection towards the old branch, without distinguishing between good and bad, and adopting an attitude of hostility towards the mistakes of Party members and cadres. The result is that the branch's prestige among the masses has decreased, Party members are pessimistic, and some are asking to withdraw from the Party.

　　(2) According to recent reports from the base points of Qiaotou, Quzhai, Zhonghe, etc., Party members universally regret that they should not have become Communist Party members, and that they should not have worked actively as Communist Party members. It is possible that some bad Party members are taking the opportunity to spread pessimistic and disappointed emotions in order to win sympathy for themselves, but the leadership should examine itself for failing to play a leading role and committing the error of tailism. The errors of Party members should be distinguished between public and private interests, those who made mistakes for private interests; those who made mistakes due to incorrect work methods; and those who offended the masses because of urgent tasks from higher levels in order to complete the tasks assigned by higher levels. The county and district leadership bears some responsibility for the latter two, and cannot completely blame them. When this situation occurs, the leadership should look for appropriate opportunities to conduct self-criticism and explanation among the masses, so that the masses understand that it is not entirely the fault of the Party members. In this way, Party members will be convinced sincerely.

　　(3) Party members who did not serve as cadres and did not have jobs in the past, the masses have no opinions on them in the process of Party rectification. The leadership must pay attention to enlightening their class consciousness and strictly examine them ideologically, breaking their "complacency" and thinking that they were right in the past and there is nothing to reflect on today. They must be made to realize that it is a mistake for Communist Party members not to care about the interests of the masses. And point out that not caring about the interests of the masses in the past is not a good long-term worker, not a good Party member. In this way, their ideological awareness can be improved and they can be cultivated into Party backbones. In addition, there are some Party member cadres who pretend to be good people among the masses, do not work and do not offend anyone. The leadership should guide the masses to compare them with Party member cadres who work actively but make mistakes due to incorrect methods, and distinguish who is good and who is bad. In this way, Party members with mistakes or big mistakes will not have the illusion that they regret their past active work, thinking that those who do not work have become good comrades, and that those who work actively have become bad Party members. At the same time, Party members are also told that the higher levels can bear part of the responsibility for the mistakes made in the past for work, but they must be responsible for their own actions of violating the decisions of the higher levels, embezzlement and corruption, seizing more fruits, beating and scolding the masses, and arbitrarily giving the masses the label of special agents, and bow their heads to the masses, admit their mistakes, and correct them in the future, which is the way out. The leadership must also calmly consider, guide the masses to repeatedly discuss, distinguish right from wrong, distinguish responsibilities, and not listen to one-sided opinions and say whatever they say.

　　(4) Party rectification democracy must cultivate backbones for carrying out ideological struggle within the Party. At the branch meetings of Party and non-Party members. Party members must take the initiative to conduct resolute struggles against all bad Party members, bad tendencies, bad styles of work, and bad behaviors within the Party. When this struggle is carried out well, the Party's prestige will be higher, and poor peasants, hired peasants, and the masses will cherish Party members and branches even more, and the Party and the masses will be closely combined. A more successful approach is to talk to or have forums with good Party members individually to improve their awareness, help them analyze problems, recognize the harm of bad Party members and bad work styles to the Party and the masses, and encourage them to have the courage to take the lead in the struggle at the meeting, so that they do not all bow their heads and remain silent at the meeting as if they have all become objects of struggle after being pressured by the masses.

　　(5) Regarding the organizational leadership of Party rectification, the experience of Handian shows that one is that the ideological struggle within the Party and the cultivation of backbones are very important in opening Party and non-Party branch meetings; the other is that there must be a unified leadership composed of Party members and good peasant representatives—the "Party Rectification Committee" or "Presidium." The specific methods of the Party rectification guidelines and policies are discussed at this meeting. Poor peasant and hired peasant representatives are very responsible to the Party and put forward valuable opinions on linking with the masses to the Party. Through them, unnecessary doubts about the Party among the masses are eliminated, and they truly see that the leadership does not shield bad Party members. Through them, the masses' excessive demands for left-leaning handling of Party members can be naturally eliminated, so that Party rectification can develop smoothly.

　　(6) Regarding the handling of Party members and cadres who have made mistakes, the masses should be allowed to have the power to directly dismiss or suggest dismissal. The masses have the right to file complaints to the people's court against the worst cadres who have committed illegal acts. However, when reviewing cadres and Party members, the policy of criticism, reasoning, and no beating should be adopted. The leadership can first explain clearly to the activists among the masses, and the Party members and cadres under review must have the right to appeal and defend themselves, so as to establish a truly democratic style.

### 整党中的几个问题

　　整党中的几个问题
  　长治县委办公室
    编者按：长治县委会及时总结研究了他们整党民主运动中的一些体验和问题，提出来大家研究，这是很好的。在这一重大而严肃的运动里，许多新的问题和经验，都须及时提出交流和研究，希参加实际运动的同志，能把自己工作中的经验与问题经常写来。
    （一）最近十余天各村在整党民主问题上，领导者有两种认识，发生两种不同的结果。一种是：从具体情况出发，分别支部党员的好坏，以治病救人纠正错误的态度整党，同时让群众尽情的批评支部党员的错误与缺点。结果是支部在群众中威信提高，党员大多数自觉反省自己错误，整党民主运动正常发展。另一种是：对老支部采取厌恶排斥，不分好坏，对党员、干部错误采取仇视。结果是支部在群众中威信降低，党员悲观，有的要求出党。
    （二）最近据桥头、璩寨、中和等基点的汇报，党员普遍后悔自己不该当共产党员，当共产党员不该积极工作。这可能有些坏党员，为了争取自己同情层，乘机散布悲观失望情绪，但领导上应该检讨的是：自己没有起领导作用，犯了尾巴主义错误。对党员的错误，不分清为公为私，那些是为私利而犯错误；那些是因工作而方法不对犯了错误；那些是因为上级任务紧迫，为了完成上级任务，而得罪群众。后二者县区领导上是有一部分责任的，不能完全怨他们。发生此种情况，领导上就应找寻适当机会，在群众中自我检讨说明，使群众了解，不完全归罪于他，如此使党员心悦诚服。
    （三）过去未当干部没工作的党员，他们在整党过程中，群众对他们无意见。领导上必须注意启发他们的阶级觉悟，严格从思想上作检查，打破他的“自满没啥”，认为过去就对，今天没啥反省的思想。必须使其认识共产党员对群众利益不关心就是错误。并指出过去不关心群众利益不是好长工，不是好党员。如此使他们思想觉悟提高，培养成党内骨干。另外，还有一种党员干部是在群众中装好人，不工作不得罪人，领导上要诱导群众，把他和积极工作因方法不对而犯错误的党员干部对比，分清谁好谁坏。如此使有错误或错误大的党员，不致发生错觉，悔不该自己过去积极工作，认为人家不工作成了好同志，咱积极工作反而成了坏党员。同时又告诉党员，凡是过去为工作犯的错误，上级可替你负一部分责任，而自己违犯上级决议、贪污腐化、多占果实、打骂群众、给群众无故戴特务帽等作威作福行为，必须自己负责，向群众低头，承认错误，今后改正，才是出路。领导上也必须冷静考虑，诱导群众反复讨论，分清是非，分别责任，不可听片面的意见说啥是啥。
    （四）整党民主必须培养党内开展思想斗争的骨干，在党与非党员的支部大会上。党员必须主动的向党内一切坏党员、坏倾向、坏作风、坏行为进行坚决的斗争。这种斗争开展的好，党的威信愈高，贫雇农与群众对党员与支部倍加爱护，党与群众密切结合。较成功的作法是，与好党员个别谈话或座谈，提高好党员的觉悟，帮助他分析问题，认识坏党员坏作风对党与群众的危害，鼓励他们在大会上作斗争起带头的勇气，不要使他们在大会上被群众给以压力后，好象都变成了斗争对象似的统统低头不说话。
    （五）整党的组织领导问题，开党与非党的支部大会，据韩店经验：一个是党内思想斗争，骨干培养很重要；另一个必须有党员与好的农民代表组成统一领导——“整党委员会”或“主席团”。关于整党的方针政策具体办法，都在这个会上讨论，贫雇农代表对党非常负责，给党提出宝贵的连系群众的意见，经过他们免除群众中对党的不必要的怀疑，真实的看到领导上对坏党员并不包庇，经过他们自然的可以消除群众对党员左的过火的处理的要求，使整党顺利发展。
    （六）对于犯错误党员、干部的处理，要允许群众有直接撤职或建议撤职之权，其中最坏的有犯法行为的干部，群众有权向人民法庭控诉。但在审查干部党员时，应采取批评说理不准动手打人的方针。领导上可首先向群众积极分子说明白，并且要使被审查的党员干部有申诉辩驳的权利，如此以达到建立真正的民主作风。
