[Benbao Wu'an News] In Qingyansi, Ninth District, after more than two months of the Party rectification democratic movement, the masses truly enjoyed democratic rights and dared to speak out about opinions that had been suppressed in their hearts for a long time. When electing leaders for the Poor Peasants' League and the New Peasants' Association, and re-electing the village government, the masses freely elected the people who were "in their hearts and eyes" to work for them. However, on the other hand, there was a tendency towards extreme democracy. Often, if the majority agreed on something, but a few individuals disagreed, it could not be resolved, causing distress to the majority, and the new cadres also felt it was "difficult to handle." For example, at a meeting of the poor peasants' group to discuss the re-election of the village government, everyone felt that Party members who had not completed their review should also participate in the election. Wang Maosong insisted on opposing, saying: "Are we letting them run the house, or are we running the house? If we are running the house, what do we need them for? Is it impossible to do without them?" Everyone explained to him: "We are fully capable of running this house, and they also have this right; we can't not let them participate." He ignored everyone's explanation and was dissatisfied with everyone's reasoning, losing his temper: "Then let them do it!" The meeting was not held, and he stormed off in anger. During the class determination movement, when the general meeting approved each person's class status, Wang Hengzhong, due to a lack of understanding of the situation, blocked thirty-two people, demanding that everyone re-determine it. Everyone disagreed in their hearts but dared not express their opinions, fearing that they would be accused of being "undemocratic." After Party member Wang Liucun reported his family situation, everyone unanimously rated him as a new middle peasant, but Wang Hengzhong said alone: "I didn't hear clearly!" He demanded that Wang Liucun talk about it again. Regarding the issue of Party member Liu Shouxian selling a donkey cheaply, the Peasants' Association Committee, based on the opinions of the majority of groups, decided to ask him to pay an additional 30,000 yuan. When it was submitted to the general meeting for approval, the masses, after careful calculation, unanimously agreed that it was very reasonable and decided to approve it. However, Li Mazi and two others whispered outside the door, insisting on opposing everyone's opinion and unreasonably demanding a supplement of 50,000 yuan. The masses were stunned, and the chairman hesitated, asking everyone, "What should we do?" The masses knew it was unreasonable and demanded that the decision be made according to the opinion of the majority, but they were afraid of being "undemocratic" and being thwarted by them. Everyone felt that it was impossible to resolve, so they abandoned reality and attempted to solve the problem by compromise, changing 30,000 to 40,000, but it was still not enough, so it was increased to 45,000, until they were helpless and said, "50,000 it is!" In this situation, the new cadres dared not make any decisions. They dared not concentrate the correct opinions of the majority of the masses to make decisions, fearing that people would say they were "monopolizing" or "undemocratic." Therefore, their work was often limited to technical aspects, such as convening meetings, raising questions, chairing the meeting, and announcing adjournment. Even the committee's prior research was "afraid that people would say it was monopolizing," and the opinions that had been researched were "afraid that people would say it was undemocratic," so they dared not bring them up.

    After discovering these situations, the work team first reviewed the one-sidedness of its own thinking, only emphasizing democracy and relaxing leadership, and adopting a tailist attitude towards the phenomenon of extreme democracy. Therefore, it caused the masses and new cadres to misunderstand democracy, thinking: "What can be done? It's democracy! You can't stop people from speaking!" After the review, they tried to overcome this tendency in order to establish a new democratic style that is led and orderly. Among the new cadres, they took many recent events as examples and asked them to discuss among themselves first: What is democracy? What is undemocratic? Where were the mistakes of the old cadres? At first, everyone sighed and felt that the work was "very difficult!" Slowly, from recounting one headache-inducing event after another, everyone realized that democracy must have leadership, and that the opinions of the majority must be concentrated to handle matters. If nothing can be decided, the masses will not agree with us! Among the masses, they also paid attention to establishing correct democratic thinking in conjunction with each movement. At the class determination meeting, Wang Fengchang arbitrarily labeled people with protective hats, only allowing himself to speak and not allowing others to express opposing opinions, which was severely criticized by everyone. Everyone said: "Anyone with an opinion can speak; are you the only one with democracy?!" Everyone believes that democracy means obeying everyone's opinion and obeying the leadership of the new cadres. This transformation is only just beginning, and more efforts will be made in the future so that everyone can correctly exercise their democratic rights.

　　青烟寺健全民主生活
  　注意克服极端民主
    【本报武安消息】九区青烟寺，经过两个多月的整党民主运动，群众真正享受到民主权利，敢于述说一向压在心头的意见，在选举贫农团、新农会的领导人和改选村政府时，群众都随意选举自己“心肝眼里的人”，来替自己办事。但在另一方面，却产生了极端民主的偏向。往往一件事情，大多数人同意了，只有个别人不同意，也不能解决，引起多数人苦恼，新干部也感到“难办”。比如：贫农小组讨论改选村政府的会上，大家认为没有审查完毕的党员，也应该参加选举。王茂松就坚持反对，他说：“叫他们当家，还是叫咱当家？叫咱当家还叫他们来干啥？少了他不行？”大家给他解释：“咱们完全能当这个家，人家也有这份权利，不能不叫人家参加。”他不理大家的解说，也不满意大家的说理，发开了脾气：“那还是叫人家干吧！”会也不开了，说罢就气冲冲的走了。在划阶级运动中，当大会通过每个人的阶级成份时，王恒中由于不了解情况，一个人就拦住三十二个人，要求大家重划，大家心里不同意，但是不敢提出意见，怕说又“不民主”了。党员王刘存自报过自己的家庭情况后，大家一致评为新中农，王恒中一个人说：“我没听清！”要王刘存再谈一次。关于党员刘守湘贱买一头驴的问题，农会委员会根据多数小组的意见，决定叫他补价三万元。提交大会通过的时候，群众经过精细计算，一致认为很合理，决定通过。有李麻子等三个人，在门外一唧咕，坚持反对大家的意见，不合理的要求补五万，群众被怔住了，主席也躇蹰起来，反问大家“怎么办？”群众明知不合理，要求按多数人的意见决定，但又怕“不民主”，使他们挽了圪＠。大家感到无法解决，便抛开实际，企图用妥协的办法解决问题，把三万改为四万，还不行，又加到四万五千，一直到无可奈何的情况时，来了个“五万就五万吧！”在这种情况下，新干部啥事也不敢作主了。不敢集中多数群众的正确意见作出决定，生怕人说“包办”，“不民主”，因此，工作往往只局限于技术方面，如：召集开会，提提问题，主持会场，宣布散会等。连委员会的事先研究都“怕人家说包办”，研究过的意见，也“怕人家说不民主”，不敢提出来。
    发现这些情况以后，工作组首先检讨了自己思想上的片面性，只强调民主，放松了领导，对极端民主的现象，采取尾巴主义的态度，因此，引起群众与新干部对民主产生误解，认为：“哪有啥办法？民主吗！不能不叫人家说话！”检讨后，设法克服这种偏向，以便树立有领导有秩序的新的民主作风。在新干部中，拿最近发生的许多事情作例子，让他们自己先讨论：啥叫民主？啥叫不民主？旧干部的错误在哪里？起初，大家都唉声叹气，感到工作“难办着哩”！慢慢的，大家从诉说一节节伤脑筋的事情里，认识到民主必须有领导，要集中大多数人的意见来办事情，如果啥事情也决定不了，群众也会不赞成咱！在群众中，也结合每一运动，注意树立正确的民主思想。在划阶级的大会上，王凤昌随便给人家戴包庇帽子，只兴自己说话，不叫别人说反对意见，受到了大家严厉的批评。都说：“谁有意见都能说，光兴你民主！？”大家都认为民主就要服从大家的意见，服从新干部的领导。这一转变还只是才开始，以后还要作更多的努力，才能使每个人都能正确的运用自己的民主权利。
