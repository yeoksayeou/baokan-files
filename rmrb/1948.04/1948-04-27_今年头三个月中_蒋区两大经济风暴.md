    Two Major Economic Storms in the Chiang Kai-shek Area in the First Three Months of This Year

    In the first three months of this year, two major economic storms have already occurred in the Chiang Kai-shek area. As of the beginning of this month, prices in various parts of the Chiang Kai-shek area have begun to rise again. The first storm began on January 5th, when the black market (hereinafter the same) price of rice per dan jumped from one million (Chiang currency, hereinafter the same) on the 2nd to one million five hundred thousand, and continued for six days, reaching one million five hundred and eighty thousand. The U.S. dollar rose to 220,000 on the 8th, while it was only 140,000 at the end of last year. Prices only began to gradually decline on the 11th.

    The second storm lasted from February 2nd to March 21st, with the rising trend like a raging wave, each wave higher than the last, experiencing a total of five peaks: First, on February 6th, before the Lunar New Year, the rice price broke the highest record in the first economic storm, rising to 1.8 million; the U.S. dollar also reached 190,000 on the 7th. Second, the opening after the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, i.e., February 14th, the rice price reached 2.4 million; the U.S. dollar was 185,000. Third, on the 23rd, the rice price was 2.4 million, and the U.S. dollar was 265,000; thereafter, it rose every day, and by the 27th, the rice price had risen to 3.6 million; the U.S. dollar reached 320,000. The fourth peak was on March 9th, when the rice price soared to 4.2 million; the U.S. dollar even knocked on the 400,000 mark. Finally, on March 21st, the rice price created a shocking record of 4.5 million; the U.S. dollar reached a peak of 550,000. According to the official statistics released by the Chiang bandit’s Joint Logistics Headquarters: the Shanghai wholesale price index for the week of March 15th to 21st reached 375,554 times that of the pre-war period, more than three and a half times the official statistics of over 100,000 times at the end of last year (actually, it should be higher than this number, such as the rice price reaching 450,000 times that of the pre-war period). According to the same official statistics: the price indices in various regions during the same week were 379,822 times in Nanjing, 345,074 times in Hankou, 237,671 times in Chongqing, and as high as 433,053 times in Tianjin.

    After the second economic storm, the temporary stable period lasted only two weeks, followed by another "dizzying" rise in prices. On the 8th of this month, the black market U.S. dollar in Shanghai rose to 660,000, and on the 19th it reached 740,000; the rice price also rebounded to 4.15 million on the 10th of this month.

    From the above facts, it can be seen that: First, the duration of the economic storms in the Chiang Kai-shek area this year is getting longer each time. The first storm lasted only six days, but the second lasted 49 days; and the interval is getting shorter and shorter. After the first storm, the interval reached more than three weeks, while after the second storm, it only lasted two weeks. Second, prices are rising faster and faster. The starting point of the rice price in the first storm was one million, and the end point was 1.58 million (this price was maintained until the beginning of February), an increase of only 58 percent; while in the second economic storm, the rice price rose from 1.8 million to 4.5 million in two months, an increase of 250 percent.

    The most important reason for the economic storms in the Chiang Kai-shek area this spring is the Chiang bandit government's vicious inflation. By the end of the year before last, the amount of Chiang currency issued had exceeded 100 trillion yuan, not including other local paper currencies of the Chiang bandits. The issuance of large-denomination customs gold notes in December before last directly promoted the soaring prices in the Chiang Kai-shek area. Another important reason is that under the all-out offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the Chiang bandits suffered repeated military defeats in Northeast China, North China, and Central China, resulting in the shrinking circulation area of Chiang currency and its increasing rejection by the people. In addition, the Chiang bandit government and the four major families are carrying out frantic looting in their dying struggle, increasing taxes and expanding hoarding and monopolies, which have also accelerated the soaring prices.

### 今年头三个月中  蒋区两大经济风暴

    今年头三个月中
    蒋区两大经济风暴
    今年头三个月中，蒋区已发生两次巨大经济风暴，至本月上旬，蒋区各地物价又已重新上涨。第一个风暴起于一月五日，黑市（下同）米价每担由二日的一百万（蒋币，下同）一跃而达一百五十万，连续六天，直抵一百五十八万。美钞八日涨到二十二万，而去年底则仅十四万，直到十一日物价始渐下降。
    第二个风暴则从二月二日持续至三月二十一日，涨风有如狂澜，一波高过一波，共经历五个高峰：一为旧历年关前的二月六日，米价突破第一个经济风暴中的最高纪录，涨达一百八十万；美钞七日亦达十九万。二为旧历新年破五的开盘，即阳历二月十四日，米价达二百四十万；美钞则为十八万五千。三为二十三日，米价为二百四十万，美钞则为二十六万五千；以后天天上涨，至二十七日，米价已涨达三百六十万；美钞则达三十二万。第四个高峰为三月九日，米价直升至四百廿万；美钞竟叩四十万大关。最后是三月廿一日，米价创四百五十万的惊人纪录；美钞则达五十五万的高峰。据蒋匪四联总处发表官方统计：三月十五日到二十一日一周间上海出售物价指数已达战前的三七五、五五四倍，较之去年底官方统计的十万余倍，两个多月内已涨达三倍半以上（实际上当高出此数，如米价已达战前的四十五万倍）。据同一官方统计：同一周间的各地物价指数，计南京为三七九、八二二倍，汉口为三四五、○七四倍，重庆为二三七、六七一倍，天津更达四三三、○五三倍。
    第二次经济风暴后，暂时平稳时期仅两周，接着物价又作“令人昏眩”的上涨。本月八日上海黑市美钞涨到六十六万，而十九日更达七十四万；米价本月十日也回涨到四百一十五万。
    从上面事实看出：第一、今年蒋区经济风暴延续时间一次较一次为长，第一次风暴为时仅六天，但第二次则延续了四十九天；而间歇期则越来越短，第一次风暴后，间歇期达三周以上，而第二次风暴后仅达两周。第二、是物价越涨越快，第一次风暴米价的起点为一百万，而终点为一百五十八万（此种价格一直维持到二月初），即仅上涨百分之五十八；而在第二次经济风暴中，米价在两个月内由一百八十万涨到四百五十万，上涨达百分之二百五十。
    造成今春蒋区经济风暴最主要的原因，为蒋匪政府的恶性通货膨胀，截至年前止，蒋币发行额已超过一百万亿元，蒋匪其他地方纸币尚不在内。年前十二月间大额关金券的发行，更直接推动蒋区物价的狂涨。另一重要原因为在人民解放军全面进攻下，蒋匪在东北、华北、华中接连不断的军事惨败，致蒋币不但流通区域日益缩小，且日益为人民所唾弃。此外蒋匪政府与四大家族在日暮途穷中进行疯狂掠夺，加捐增税，和扩张囤积垄断，亦使物价加速飞涨。
