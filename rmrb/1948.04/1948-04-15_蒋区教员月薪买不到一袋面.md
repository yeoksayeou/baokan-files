Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 10th: A compilation of news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas reveals that due to Chiang Kai-shek's clique using almost all the wealth extracted from the people's blood and sweat for counter-revolutionary civil war, cultural and educational institutions at all levels in the Chiang-controlled areas are experiencing extreme financial difficulties. The Peking Research Institute, which had over 200 staff members before the War of Resistance Against Japan, now has only 130-plus members. Equipment is incomplete, and research work has partially ground to a halt. Peking University's monthly funding is only 570 million Chiang currency, while the electricity bill for the university's six colleges (Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Engineering, Medicine, and Agriculture) alone consumed 1 billion Chiang currency in February. The university's Kuomintang authorities have even come up with the bizarre idea of announcing the collection of rent and utility fees for faculty and staff dormitories, setting a precedent in the history of Peking University. Tangshan Institute of Technology sent several telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek's clique in February, urging them to release funds. The Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Education finally remitted 40 million yuan, but the telegram fees alone cost 6-7 million yuan. Private middle schools in the Ping (Beiping) city are unable to sustain themselves due to the Chiang Kai-shek's clique's regulations on excessively low fees. When collecting fees, they superficially comply with the regulations, but secretly increase them. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, teachers in private middle schools in Tianjin earned monthly salaries ranging from 60 to 140 yuan, which could buy 24 to 56 bags of flour. Currently, the highest earners receive only 5 million yuan, which cannot buy even three bags of flour, while the lowest earners receive only 1.6 million yuan, which cannot buy even one bag. The Chiang Kai-shek educational subsidy for Jinghai County near Tianjin is only 200,000 yuan per school per month. In areas such as Neixiang and Tifen Port in the county, which are dozens of miles away from the county seat, if someone is sent to collect the funds, 200,000 yuan is not even enough to cover the round-trip travel expenses. In Nanchang, Jiangxi, the office expenses issued by the Chiang Kai-shek's clique to various official middle schools are only enough to buy chalk. Currently, most schools have dilapidated buildings, lack equipment, and teachers are starving.

　　蒋区教员月薪买不到一袋面
    【新华社陕北十日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：由于蒋匪榨取人民血汗所得，几全部用于反革命内战，蒋区各级文化教育机构经费困难万分。北平研究院抗战前有职员二百余人，目前仅剩下一百三十余人，设备残缺，研究工作部分陷于停顿。北京大学每月经费仅蒋币五亿七千万元，该校文、理、法、工、医、农六院二月份电费即消耗十亿元。校方蒋党当局竟异想天开宣布将征收教职员宿舍房租及水电费，创北大校史先例。唐山工学院二月份向蒋匪催要经费，拍了好几次电报，蒋匪教育部才汇来了四千万元，但电报费一项就用了六、七百万元。平市私立中学因蒋匪规定收费过低无法维持，收费时表面遵照规定收费，暗中却予增加。天津私立中学教员抗战前月薪由六十元至一百四十元，可买二十四袋至五十六袋面粉；目前收入最多者仅五百万元，购不到三袋面粉；最低者仅一百六十万元，买不到一袋。天津附近静海县蒋匪教育补助费，每月每校仅发廿万元。该县内乡、提芬港一带距县城数十里，如派人前往领取，二十万元尚不足往返路费。江西南昌各官立中学蒋匪所发办公费仅够买粉笔。目前各校大都房子破烂，设备缺乏，教员饿着肚子。
