    【新华社陕北十九日电】莫斯科讯：苏联国家计划委员会于十五日发表今年第一季生产总结公报，各业均超过计划，显示了“五年计划四年完成”的口号正全力并顺利地实行着。公报指出各种主要数字如下：一、工业：今年第一季工业总产量计划完成了百分之一○二，比去年同季增加了百分之三十二，在敌人蹂躏过的地区则增加百分之五十九。其中重要者如：钢铁工业完成计划百分之一○七，较去年同季增加铣铁百分之三十六，钢百分之四十一，卷钢百分之四十三。西部煤矿工业完成计划百分之一○五，东部煤矿工业完成计划百分之一○一，较去年同季增加百分之二十，南部与西部石油工业完成计划百分之一○四，东部石油工业完成计划百分之一○六，较去年同季增加汽油百分之二十四，挥发油百分之三十五，煤油百分之二十四，天然瓦斯百分之二十二。电力站工业完成计划百分之一○四，较去年同季增加电力百分之十八。交通设备工业完成计划百分之一○六，较去年同季增加火车头百分之十一，车厢百分之五十二，无轨电车百分之八十。汽车与拖拉机工业完成计划百分之一○九，较去年同季增加运货汽车百分之三十三，载客汽车百分之二十，公共汽车百分之九十四，拖拉播种机百分之一○三，拖拉耕种机百分之一百四十七，收割机百分之四百二十八。纺织工业完成计划百分之一○四，较去年同季增加棉织品百分之四十四，毛织品百分之三十二。食品工业完成计划百分之一○八，较去年同季增加百分之四十三。二、农业：今年第一季的春耕准备工作已经完成，比去年水平为高。三、运输业：今年第一季铁道每日平均运货总量，完成计划百分之一○三，比去年同季增加百分之三十四。四、物价与实际工资：由于去年实行货币改革与取消配给制，使今年第一季之物价大大降低，集体农场的市场物价，比去年同季降落百分之六十九，城市合作社市场物价降落百分之五十五，因此，卢布的购买力增加了百分之四十一。由于物价减低，卢布购买力增加，加上工资与薪金的增加，今年第一季实际工资比去年同季平均增加百分之五十一，以上数字尚未把四月十日第二次减低物价计算在内。五、职工与劳动生产力：今年第一季国民经济部门工人与机关职工，比去年同季增加了二百万，其中产业工人即有一百万。劳动生产力比去年同季增加了百分之二十一，其中在机器制造工业方面占百分之三十四，在钢铁工业方面占百分之三十六。公报最后指出：今年第一季在工农以及知识分子间广泛展开了社会主义竞赛，“今年是苏联战后五年计划有决定意义的一年”。
