　　Tainan: Rampant Smuggling by Japanese Ships
　　Chiang Bandit's Overseas Remittance Income Greatly Reduced

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Tainan News: Chiang bandits allow Japanese ships sailing to Taiwan to engage in large-scale smuggling. Recently, Japanese smuggling ships discovered near Kaohsiung Port include "Nichisho Maru" and "Hokuun Maru," among others, totaling three ships. The total value of smuggled goods on two of these ships reached over 15 million Chiang bandit Taiwan dollars (equivalent to approximately 3 billion+ Chiang bandit "legal tender"). Smuggled goods include auto parts, radio equipment, Western medicine, light bulbs, steel wire, knitting needles, candy, shark fins, and other items. The Nichisho Maru, according to a contract between Chiang bandit and MacArthur, was intended to transport Taiwanese sugar. This is the second time it has come to Taiwan, each time fully loaded with smuggled Japanese goods.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: According to disclosures in Chiang-controlled newspapers: Due to the Chiang bandits' adoption of low exchange rates to cruelly exploit the blood and sweat of overseas Chinese, most overseas Chinese remittances refuse to go through Chiang bandit banks for exchange, resulting in a sharp decline in the Chiang bandit's overseas remittance income. The "Bank of China," owned by the Song Ziwen family, which monopolizes all international exchange business in the Chiang-controlled areas, received only a real value of over 11 million US dollars in overseas remittances throughout last year, a tenfold reduction compared to the pre-war figure of 100 million US dollars annually. In January of this year, it further decreased to 100,000 US dollars, less than one-ninth of the average monthly amount for the entire last year. As the gap between the Chiang bandit's official exchange rate and the actual (black market) exchange rate widens daily, the evasion of overseas remittances this year will inevitably be even worse than last year.

　　台南日轮走私猖獗
  　蒋匪侨汇收入大减
    【新华社陕北三十日电】台南消息：蒋匪允准驶台之日轮，大事走私。近日高雄港附近发现走私日轮已有“日昌丸”、“北运丸”等三轮，其中两轮私货总值达蒋匪台币一千五百万元（折合蒋匪“法币”约三十余亿元）以上。走私货物包括汽车零件、无线电器材、西药、电泡、钢丝、纺织针、糖果、鱼翅等项。按日昌轮系蒋匪与麦克阿瑟订立合同，来台装运台糖者，此次已第二次来台，每次均满载走私日货。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据蒋区报纸披露：由于蒋匪采取低价汇率残酷剥削侨胞血汗，大部侨胞汇款均拒绝经过蒋匪银行汇兑，遂使蒋匪侨汇收入锐减。垄断蒋区全部国际汇兑业务之宋子文家族的“中国银行”，去年全年经收之侨汇实值仅为一千一百余万美元，较之战前每年一亿美元之数，已缩减十倍。今年一月份更减到十万美元，不及去年全年每月平均数的九分之一。随着蒋匪官价汇率与实际（黑市）汇率之日益悬殊，今年侨汇之逃避，必将更甚于去年。
