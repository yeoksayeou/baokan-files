The truth of a false spy case has come to light. At a meeting, a former (1942-1943) public security officer gave a report and reviewed his mistakes. Several other people involved made supplementary statements, and a doctor testified that the "poison" at the time was concocted by the accuser, Fu Shouliang himself, who obtained *Akebia trifoliata*, *Coptis chinensis*, *calcite*, and chili peppers from his pharmacy. The staff member responsible for investigating the case reported on the investigation process and read out the list, removing the "spy label" from all sixty-five falsely accused individuals. Those who had the spy label removed were overjoyed. One young man said, "This is the happiest day of my twenty-five years. The masses have clear eyes, and the Communist Party's leadership is good; they have clearly distinguished me." He continued, "I have bad habits brought from the old society. Everyone can point them out to me in the future, and I will definitely correct them and move forward with everyone."

(Postscript: Publicly correcting wrongly classified elements is a first attempt in our district, and the experience is very immature, only for everyone's reference, and we hope to raise questions for discussion. According to comrades from the Shilibian working group, the correction of wrongly criticized households in that village was somewhat late; it is a great loss to leave these people aside during the rectification of the ranks and the democratic movement, and earlier correction would be beneficial to clarifying the thinking of middle and poor peasants and strengthening correct class consciousness. – Reporter)

　　假特务案真相大白
  　六十五人摘掉帽子
    在这大会上纠正了一件假特务案，首由当时（四二、四三年）的公安员作了报告，检讨了错误；另外几个有关的人作了补充，并由一个医生证明当时的“毒药”是诬害人的傅守良自己到他药铺里拿木通、黄连、青石、辣椒配的，并由负责调查研究这个案件的工作员报告了调查研究经过，宣读名单，给这六十五个被诬告的人一律脱掉“特务帽子”。脱下了特务帽子的人更是高兴，一个青年说：“这是我二十五岁来最高兴的一天。群众眼光明，共产党领导好，把我辨别清楚了。”接着说：“我本身从旧社会带来的不好习气，大家往后可给我指出来，我一定纠正，跟大家往前走。”
    （附记：公开纠正错订成份的工作在我区还是初作，经验很不成熟，只供大家参考，并希望提出问题讨论。据什里店工作组同志谈，该村对错斗户的纠正作得还嫌迟了些；在整编队伍、民主运动中，把这许多人丢在一边是很大的损失，而且早点纠正对中贫农的澄清思想，加强正确的阶级意识都是有好处的。——记者）
