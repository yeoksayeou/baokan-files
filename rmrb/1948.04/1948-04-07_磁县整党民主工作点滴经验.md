Title: Glimpses of Democratic Work in Party Rectification in Cixian County

Some villages in Cixian County did not formulate policies practically based on local conditions when organizing the masses, resulting in two deviations that need to be corrected: First, in some places, the poor and hired peasants were not relied upon when organizing the masses, failing to form a class force for them to connect and organize middle peasants, but instead, they started organizing middle and poor peasants simultaneously. Second, the middle peasants were organized separately, which prevented the poor peasants from becoming a leading force.

    Pay Attention to Class Unity, Avoid Falling into Sectarianism

    In addition, some places have been connecting people by "pian" (a neighborhood unit) for a long time when organizing the masses, which naturally led us into the old sectarian circles of the masses. For example, Fuma Ditch had old sectarianism between the upper and lower streets. This time, our work team had one cadre living in the upper street and another in the lower street, and each street organized a poor peasant group. As a result, the two groups could not unite when they were organized together, and everyone started engaging in sectarianism. During the Party rectification, the masses in this street criticized the Party members in that street, and the masses in that street criticized the Party members in this street, forming a sectarian struggle. Some villages did not have this problem because they paid attention to the issue of sectarianism from the beginning. For example, Linshui's east and west streets had sectarianism. At the beginning, education was conducted among the masses, and when organizing the masses, the poor and hired peasants of each street were allowed to connect with each other. The poor and hired peasants in the west street also went to the east street to find poor and hired peasants. This way of mobilizing the masses prevented them from falling into the sectarian circles of the masses.

    The leaders and backbones of the masses should gradually emerge from the movement. Some places did not pay attention to cultivating and supporting the leaders and backbones emerging from the masses, but instead subjectively looked for backbones. For example, when the poor peasant organization in Nanlai Village elected cadres, the masses proposed five people. We felt that these people were all old men, so we induced the masses to propose Li Fu, feeling that he was young and capable. As a result, the masses reluctantly elected him. Once Li Fu was elected, he became arrogant. When discussing the issue of cadres, he said, "Use the method used for landlords." He also said, "Ya Gu City has detained the cadres, let's detain the cadres once too." When the work team smoked, he said, "Get a box from our cooperative!" He completely adopted the old ways of old cadres. Later, we learned that he had shielded landlords and had prejudices against cadres, and he was an ambitious person.

    In some places, because we didn't pay attention at the beginning, and only thought that poor people could dare to speak, some cadres and revenge-seekers who had stepped down were able to sneak in, and some even seized leadership, preventing upright and honest peasants from daring to come forward. Houjiagou initially allowed a former peasant association chairman who had stepped down to participate in the poor peasant group. He went to the street to intimidate the masses, saying, "He (referring to the cadre) lives in a Western-style building! Watch me live in a Western-style building!" The masses dared not say anything. Later, in the masses' complaints, the grievances were directed at him. It turned out that when he was the chairman of the peasant association, he helped the landlords attack the poor and hired peasants.

    Party Internal Ideological Struggle Combined with Mass Pressure

    Relying on the masses to rectify the Party was done well in some places, but deviations occurred in other places. The places that did well combined the ideological struggle within the Party with the pressure from the masses. On the one hand, Party members should be educated to consciously carry out self-criticism and criticism. On the other hand, the masses should be mobilized to offer opinions, so as not to create opposition between the entire Party and the masses. For example, in the initial Party rectification in Houjiagou, only fifteen people were mobilized to participate in the branch meeting. However, with only these fifteen people offering opinions, it formed a mass struggle against the Party, and the ideological struggle within the Party could not be developed.

    In addition, in the Party rectification in Fuyang, the Party rectification relied solely on the pressure of the masses, resulting in better self-reflection when the masses participated in the branch meeting, and no self-reflection when the masses did not participate. As a result, the masses and Party members developed a misconception: "The masses believe that Communist Party members are criminals." Party members felt that "it is not glorious for the masses to be dilatory," creating opposition between Party members and the masses.

    Also, in Xin Sizhuang, good and bad Party members were treated the same during Party rectification. As a result, many good Party members had already been absorbed by the masses to participate in the poor peasant group, but we still insisted on asking them to reflect, which was also inappropriate.

    Reflect from a Class Standpoint, Don't Dwell on Minor Problems

    The ideological alignment of the masses is mainly to improve the class consciousness of the masses, but in some places, everyone, regardless of gender, age, or child, is required to conduct ideological reflection, and even individual corrupt minor problems between men and women must be examined, which is not appropriate. This will hurt the feelings of the masses and cause disunity between families and couples. In particular, women do not want to examine their corruption in front of the peasant association, their parents-in-law, or others. Some places separate men and women to avoid this, which is also inappropriate. The main thing is to use the reflection and complaints of a few typical people to enlighten everyone's class consciousness. There is no need for everyone to conduct an ideological reflection on general minor problems.

### 磁县整党民主工作点滴经验

　　磁县整党民主工作点滴经验
    磁县在组织群众队伍中，有些村没切实根据当地情况来确定方针，产生了两个偏向需要纠正：一是有的地方组织群众队伍时，没有依靠贫雇农，使他们形成个阶级力量，再去串连组织中农，而是把中贫农同时下手去组织；另一个是把中农单独来组织，结果贫农便不能成为一个领导力量了。
    注意阶级团结　不要陷入宗派
    此外有的地方在组织群众时，长时间一直是以片为单位去串连，结果使我们很自然的陷入群众旧有的宗派圈子。如驸马沟上下街以前就有旧宗派，这次我们工作队也是一个干部住上街，一个干部住下街，上下街各组织了一个贫农组，结果往一起组织时，两组怎样也伙不起来，大家闹开了宗派。在整党时，也是这街群众向那街党员提意见，那街群众向这街党员提意见，形成个宗派斗争了。有的村因开始就注意到宗派问题，便没有发生这毛病，如临水东西街有宗派，一开始便在群众中进行了教育，并在组织群众时，让贫雇那个街也去串连，西街贫雇也到东街去找贫雇。这样发动群众，便没有陷入在群众的宗派圈子里。
    群众的领袖和骨干，应当是从运动中逐渐涌现出来的，有的地方没有注意从群众中涌现出来的领袖骨干，去培养、扶植，而是依主观思想去找骨干。如南来村贫农组织选举干部时，群众提出五个人，我们觉得这些人都是老汉，便诱导群众提李福，觉得他是青年还能干，结果群众勉强把他选上了。李福一被选后，就骄傲起来了，讨论对干部问题时，他就说：“拿出对地主的办法就可以。”并说：“伢固城都把干部扣起来，咱也把干部一遭卡了吧。”工作队吸烟时，他就说：“到咱合作社拿上一盒吧！”他完全是旧干部的一套旧作风。后来了解他，才知道他包庇过地主，对干部有成见，是个野心家。
    还有些地方，因我们开始不注意，光认为是穷人敢说话就可以，结果使一些下了台的干部报复分子混进来，有的并窃取了领导权，影响正派的老实农民不敢来出头。侯家沟开始即让一个下了台的农会长，参加了贫农团，他便去街威吓群众说：“他（指干部）都住洋楼哩！看我住洋楼吧！”群众不敢吭，后来在群众诉苦中，才把苦诉到他头上，原来他当农会长时，帮助地主打击贫雇。
    党内思想斗争结合群众压力
    依靠群众来整党，有的地方就比较做的好，有地方就出了偏向。做的好的地方，是党内的思想斗争与群众压力相结合，一方面要教育党员，自觉的开展自我批评和批评，另一方面再发动群众提意见，这样才不致使整个党员与群众闹对立。如侯家沟在开始整党中，只发动十五个群众参加支部会，但光这十五人提意见，形成个群众斗争党，党内思想斗争展不开。
    另外滏阳整党中，单纯依靠群众压力来整党，形成群众参加支部会反省就较好，群众不参加就不反省了。结果在群众党员思想上都造成个错觉：“群众认为共产党员是罪人。”党员觉得“群众耍拖不光荣”，使党员和群众形成对立。
    还有辛寺庄，在整党中，把好坏党员一样看，结果有许多好党员，已被群众吸收参加贫农团了，我们还硬叫他去反省，这也是不大妥当的。
    从阶级上来反省　不要纠缠小毛病
    群众的思想站队，主要是为了提高群众的阶级觉悟，但有些地方，不分男女老幼，每个人要都来个思想反省，甚至连男女有个别腐化小毛病，也要检讨，这是不大妥当的。这样会刺伤群众的感情，一直引起家庭夫妻间的不团结等现象，特别是妇女，她不愿在农会、也不愿在公公婆婆、或其他人的面前检讨她的腐化。有的地方为了避免这点，把男人和女人分开开会，这也是不大妥当的。主要应是以几个典型人的反省和诉苦，来启发大家的阶级觉悟，不需要每个人对一般的小毛病，也都来一个思想反省的。　　　　　　（磁县联合办公室）
