Xinhua News Agency, East China, 8th. After the recovery of the Zibo mining area, reconstruction work has begun. The area suffered severe damage during the occupation by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. According to a survey in Boshan City alone, citizens were forced to pay 300,000 jin of millet every month, and the various temporary fees, military service fees, staff food expenses, armed suppression fees, clothing fees, and sentry fees levied by other Bao and township offices were too numerous to count. Export taxes on coking coal were 200,000 yuan (Chiang Kai-shek currency, the same below) per ton, export taxes on raw coal were 100,000 yuan per ton, consolidated tax was 8,000 yuan, and local levies were 10,000 yuan. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops were also supplied with coal for burning by private coal mines at no cost. In addition, the puppet Chamber of Commerce, Baojia offices also carried out large-scale extortion, so that of the original 62 private coal mines and small coal pits in the city, only 23 now remain, and production has been greatly reduced. Half of the original 35 grocery stores have closed down. The original 250 cigarette businesses, in addition to heavy taxes, were also hit by the dumping of American cigarettes, and only about 100 remain. A skilled worker in the city earns 30,000 yuan a day, which is only enough to buy one jin of grain, not even enough for one person to eat. When our army recovered the Hongshan Coal Mine on March 14, the democratic government personnel immediately started the recovery work amidst the sound of gunfire. On the 16th, a workers' symposium was held, calling for the rapid repair of the machines destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The workers unanimously believed that "The coal mine is our own, and the machines are our rice bowls." After the meeting, 54 workers managing the power plant and water source immediately began to dig out the parts they had hidden in advance, assemble the machines, and on the 23rd, the Hongshui Power Plant was repaired and began to send electricity. When the entire Zibo area was liberated, the democratic government immediately allocated 200 million yuan in local currency and 50,000 jin of grain to Yan Shan Iron Factory, Calcium Carbide Factory, Porcelain Kiln Factory, Glass Factory, Electric Mill Factory, and Shentou Power Plant and other than ten factories to solve the workers' living difficulties. At the same time, a symposium was held with managers of various manufacturers to explain the democratic government's industrial and commercial policies. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce also allocated 300,000 jin of grain and oil and salt to Boshan City to sell at low prices to supply workers and citizens. Now all factories have resumed work one after another, prices in the entire region are becoming more stable, and various recovery work is still being carried out vigorously.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 8th. The Zhang (Dian) Bo (Shan) Railway, the main branch line of the Jiaoji Railway, was fully opened to traffic on the evening of the 22nd of last month after its liberation. During the Laiwu Victory of the People's Liberation Army last February, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits dragged all the locomotives and carriages to Jinan. We had changed to using the narrow gauge between the Xihe and Dalun stations for traffic. This time, thanks to the protection of the railway workers, it was not destroyed. After the Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled from Boshan, Xihe, and Dalun on the 12th, that section was immediately opened to traffic. After Zichuan was recovered on the 22nd, the entire line was opened to traffic at 10 p.m. that night.

　　淄博煤矿区相继复工
  　张博铁路已全线通车
    【新华社华东八日电】淄博矿区收复后，已开始重建工作。该地在蒋匪侵占期间，曾受到严重破坏。仅据博山市调查，该市市民被迫每月须缴纳三十万斤小米，其他保镇公所之临时费、兵役费、职员菜金费、武装扫荡费、服装费、站岗费等种类之多难以统计。焦煤每吨要纳出口税蒋币（下同）二十万元，原煤每吨纳出口税十万元，统税八千元，地方捐一万元，蒋匪驻军之烧煤也全由私营煤矿无代价供给。此外，伪商会保甲公所也大肆敲榨勒索，故全市原有私营煤矿和小炭井六十二家，现只剩下二十三家，且产量大减。原有三十五家杂货号已有半数歇业，原有二百五十家卷烟业，除苛杂外又受美帝香烟倾销打击，现只剩百余家。该市一个技术工人每天挣工资三万元，只能买一斤粮，还不够一个人吃。此次我军于三月十四日收复洪山煤矿时，民主政府人员在炮火声中即着手进行恢复工作，十六日召开了工人座谈会，号召迅速修复被蒋匪破坏的机器，工人们一致认为：“煤矿是咱自己的了，机器就是咱们的饭碗。”会后管理发电所和水源地的五十四个工人立即动手挖出事先藏起来的零件，装配机器，二十三日即将洪水发电所修竣，并开始送电。当淄博全区解放时，民主政府为解决工人的生活困难，立即拨出本币两万万元和粮食五万斤，给颜山铁厂、电石厂、瓷窑厂、玻璃厂、电磨厂及神头发电厂等十余工厂。同时召开各厂商经理座谈会，解释民主政府的工商业政策。工商局并拨三十万斤粮食与油盐给博山市低价发售供应工人市民。现各厂均已相继复工，全区物价日趋稳定，各项恢复工作仍大力进行中。
    【新华社华东八日电】胶济路主要支线张（店）博（山）铁路于上月二十二日解放后，当晚即全线通车。去年二月解放军莱芜大捷时，蒋匪将该路所有车头车厢拖往济南，我曾改用西河大昆仑两站间之窄轨通车。此次，由于铁路工人的保护，未遭破坏，十二日蒋匪由博山西河大昆仑逃走后，该段当即通车。二十二日收复淄川后，当晚十点即全线通车。
