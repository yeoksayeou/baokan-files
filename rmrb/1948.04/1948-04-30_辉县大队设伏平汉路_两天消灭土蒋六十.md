The People's Daily Taihang, 28th: To effectively combat the Chiang bandit local bullies' attempts to seize grain and conscript soldiers, the Hui County Detachment in northern Henan Province actively launched attacks on the 15th and 17th of this month. They ambushed the Chiang bandits near the suburbs of Hui County and along the Pinghan Railway. In two days, they killed, wounded, and captured 62 enemy soldiers from the Security Regiment and "People's Self-Defense Force," seizing 36 long and short guns and over 1,300 rounds of ammunition. After the first phase of Party rectification and military training, the soldiers' enthusiasm for killing the enemy greatly increased, and they actively formulated summer plans for eliminating the enemy. In order to protect the spring plowing of the people in the border areas, a part of the detachment advanced into the eastern Hui County area on the 14th to conduct activities. On the night of the 15th, they set up ambushes in villages such as Zhao Zhuang, Yang Zhuang, and Da Guanzhuang to strike at the enemy looting outside. At dawn the next day, about 80 members of the Security Regiment stationed in Meng Zhuang, returning from conscripting soldiers from Wuligou and Jiuhuangshan, fell into the ambush circle of our right-wing troops in Da Guanzhuang. Our army rose up to meet them, catching the enemy off guard. After half an hour of battle, the enemy was dispersed, with 15 killed, wounded, and captured, and four rifles and over 300 rounds of ammunition seized. After a day of rest, on the night of the 17th, they took sudden action at long range, reaching the area of Shangtonggu and Laodaojing in the Xinxiang section of the Pinghan Railway. They struck at over 400 enemies from the Xinxiang Security Regiment and the "People's Self-Defense Brigade" organized by Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense, who were guarding Da Huangtun and Jiehaisi and were looting grain in all directions. The enemy, after burning and looting in villages such as Dongxilianyan and Shen Zhuang on the border between Xinxiang and Hui County, also fell into our ambush while retreating through the area. In just one hour of battle, two enemy detachments were completely annihilated. In this battle, a total of 12 enemies were killed or wounded, 35 were captured, one light machine gun, 31 rifles, one Mauser pistol, 20 hand grenades, and 1,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. More than 20 captured people were rescued, and six livestock and some grain were recovered.
