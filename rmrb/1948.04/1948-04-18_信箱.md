    Comrade Liu Dexue: The issue you raised concerning the poor peasant Li Fengjiang from Shangzhai Village, Second District of Hongtong, has been forwarded to the Hongtong County Government for investigation and resolution.
    Comrades Fugui, Zhengxiang, and Junfeng from Xiaqiyuan Village, Ci County: The issues you raised concerning the apportionment of agricultural tax and military shoes have been forwarded to the work team comrades for resolution.
    Comrade Han Xue from the Political Department of the Jin-Cha-Ji North Yue Military Region: Our newspaper has currently stopped publishing missing person notices. The attached letter has been mailed on your behalf.
    All female comrades of the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee Work Team: Your suggestions regarding the Infant Care Regulations have been forwarded to the Education Department of the Border Region Government for resolution.
    Comrade Wen Xin and Comrades Niu Zhenjiang, Zhang Xiwena et al.: The "Order to Abolish Road Passes" promulgated by the Border Region Government on April 10th clearly stipulates: "The road pass system is completely abolished within this Border Region." Landlords and rich peasants are naturally included. The government's decrees should be resolutely implemented, and Comrade Wen Xin's concerns are unnecessary to discuss.
    Comrade Ma Li, Civil Affairs Section, Guan County: The letter you sent regarding the issue of letters sent by military dependents has been forwarded to the Postal Administration.
    Comrade Yang Zhenhua, Xingtai: Your issue has been forwarded to Xingtai County and then to your district office for handling.
    Comrade Ge Yumin: 1. After the organ's production cleanup, you employees are naturally free to choose your profession. If you wish to engage in handicrafts, you can apply to the bank for a small loan to solve your funding difficulties. 2. The Border Government is currently revising the dispatch method, and your suggestions have been forwarded for reference.
    Comrade Jia Qingchuan, Neiqiu: 1. If two poor elderly farmers had an adopted son who has now left, adopting another adopted son does not violate the Land Law. 2. If another poor farmer's family has two elderly people and three daughters, they should naturally be allocated land according to five people. When the daughters marry in the future, their land will be handled by themselves. 3. A family with two elderly people and four unmarried sons should still be allocated land according to six people because the future wives also have a share of land allocated in their natal families.
    Comrade Tang Wei: The issue you raised regarding the transfer and reception of military dependents has been forwarded to the Finance Department of the Border Government. Once the new method for dispatch and substitute farming is issued, these issues can be resolved.
