Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: As our Northwest People's Liberation Army's powerful forces intensify their siege of Luochuan, the bandit chief Hu Zongnan hurriedly mobilized the 30th Division of the 1st Army, the 36th Division of the 29th Army, and the 65th Division, the 38th Division, and the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, totaling about nine brigades, nearly 80,000 troops, from western Henan, eastern Shaanxi, and southern Shaanxi to reinforce northward along the Xian-Yu Highway. After being intercepted by our army's forward troops, by the 11th, the Hu bandit army had only advanced to the suburbs of Yijun. Our army is continuing to deliver head-on blows. A New China News Agency frontline reporter commented: Since our army's great victory in Yichuan and the subsequent expansion of a powerful offensive, in just one month, our army has successively recovered and liberated cities including Ganquan, Xunyi, Baishui, and seven cities in the Huanglong area: Yichuan, Hancheng, Huanglong, Huangling, Yijun, Xunyang, and Chengcheng. We have also completed the tight encirclement of the isolated city of Luochuan, thereby unfolding a favorable situation for recovering Yan'an and liberating the Northwest. The Hu bandit attempted to salvage this defeat and hurriedly mobilized the aforementioned forces, setting out from Tongguan on the 6th of this month to reinforce northward along the Xian-Yu Road. Upon entering our Yijun area, they were immediately intercepted by our army's forward troops. By the 11th, they had only advanced about ninety li, averaging a mere ten li per day. The Hu bandit army, intimidated by our army's powerful and victorious offensive, hesitated to move forward, congested on the Xian-Yu Road, just like maggots in a cesspool. Since our army drove deep into the Huanglong Mountain area, the Hu bandit had boasted of annihilating our main force, but as our main forces are intensifying the siege of Luochuan, the Hu bandit army has only completed less than half the journey in six days. In early March, when our army besieged Yichuan, Liu Kan led four brigades to reinforce, averaging more than fifty li per day. Seeing the facts today, it further proves that the ambitious but incompetent Hu Zongnan is becoming increasingly timid and incompetent, and his command is becoming increasingly useless. The New China News Agency frontline reporter pointed out that the Hu bandit army has been frantically raping, looting, and killing along the way, which has caused deep resentment and indignation among the military and civilians in our area, who vow to annihilate the Hu bandit army in the Huanglong Mountain area. Such inhuman atrocities by the Hu bandit army only demonstrate their cowardice and impending doom.

　　胡匪怯弱无能
  　北犯增援仅日行十余里
    拥塞咸榆路上好象粪蛆
    【新华社西北十三日电】当我西北人民解放军强大部队，加紧围攻洛川之际，匪首胡宗南急忙自豫西、陕东、陕南调集整一军之三十师，整二十九军之三六师，及整六五师、整三八师、骑二旅等部，共约九个旅近八万之众，沿咸榆公路北援，经我军前哨部队阻击，至十一日止，该胡匪军仅进至宜君城郊，我军正续予迎头痛击中。新华社前线记者评称：自我军在宜川大捷，并乘胜扩展强大攻势以来，在短短一个月内，我军先后光复与解放之城市，即有甘泉、＠县、白水，及黄龙分区所属八个城市中之宜川、韩城、黄龙、黄陵、宜君、＠阳、澄城等七座城市，并完成了对洛川孤城的严密包围，从此展开了收复延安，解放西北的有利形势。胡匪图挽救此一败局，急忙调集上述兵力，于本月六日自同官出动，沿咸榆路北援，当其进入我宜君地区，即遭我军前哨部队阻击，至十一日仅前进约九十里，平均每日速度仅十余里。胡匪军慑于我军强大胜利攻势，竟趑趄不前，拥塞于咸榆路上，恰似粪坑里的蛆虫。自我军长驱挺入黄龙山区以来，胡匪曾吹嘘要歼灭我军主力，但当我大军正加紧围攻洛川之际，该胡匪军在六天内只走完了不足一半的路程。在三月初我军围攻宜川时，刘戡率领四个旅来援，平均每天走了五十多里。看了今天的事实，更加证明志大才疏的胡宗南，是越来越显得他怯弱无能，他的指挥也是越来越显得不中用了。新华社前线记者指出，此次胡匪军沿途疯狂奸淫烧杀，我区军民深为痛愤，誓将胡匪军歼灭于黄龙山区，而胡匪军此种无人道的暴行，仅表示其怯懦和行将覆亡而已。
