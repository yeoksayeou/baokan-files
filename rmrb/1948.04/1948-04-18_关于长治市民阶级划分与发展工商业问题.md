Discussion and Research

    Recently, we have received many letters from readers raising numerous questions regarding various aspects of land reform, which we greatly appreciate. Some questions have been asked by several readers simultaneously, indicating that they represent the thoughts and understandings of a segment of cadres, Party members, and the masses. We now plan to use a certain amount of space to answer those more common questions. We hope everyone will continue to raise questions, but please be specific and clear. The answers here may not be entirely correct, and everyone is welcome to offer further discussion and research.

    Regarding the Issue of Class Division and Industrial and Commercial Development in Changzhi City

    Based on the recent compiled draft by Comrades Song Keren and Wang Xun from the Changzhi United Office, as well as the reports from the Taihang Branch of the Xinhua News Agency on Changzhi's industry and commerce, and some other materials we have seen, we believe that the leadership of Changzhi City continues to apply the old set of views used in implementing land reform policies in rural areas to the city's industry and commerce. We are raising this for everyone to study.

    According to the survey materials from the Changzhi City Construction Section, Changzhi's production is mainly based on industry and commerce. The masses in the upper dozen streets of the city "rely on the city for their livelihood," while those in the lower streets have a considerable amount of land. Of their total annual income, industrial and commercial production accounts for 60 to 70 percent. For a city where agriculture does not occupy an important position and which serves as the economic center of the Shangdang area in terms of industry and commerce, developing urban industry and commerce is undoubtedly of particular importance. However, the guiding ideology reflects a lack of clear distinction between urban and rural concepts, treating urban industry and commerce entirely with the anti-feudal struggle methods used in rural areas. This is primarily manifested in the view of class analysis in the city. We believe that the class composition of the citizens of Changzhi, an old liberated area, should be differentiated according to their possession of means of production and their relations of production, as workers, peasants, poor people, small vendors, small handicraftsmen, small and medium-sized industrial and commercial capitalists, etc. However, the manuscripts and materials we have seen, such as the "Changzhi Guide," refer to them as poor peasants, farmhands, middle peasants, landlords, and rich peasants, as targets of struggle. According to the city party committee's explanation, middle peasants are the urban middle class, and they are to be treated as objects of unity and care, not to be allowed to hold power. What attitude should be taken towards those above the middle class? The city party committee stated very clearly: "In the future, the targets of struggle should still be controlled, but under the conditions of political bowing and economic surrender, they should be given wages for their labor" (see "Changzhi Guide," Issue 33, March 16). Obviously, the "middle class" of the city is being treated as the "middle peasants" of the countryside, and this method of class division is wrong. As we understand it, independent handicraftsmen who are equivalent to middle peasants (i.e., those who rely on their own labor and do not exploit others) are not some kind of middle class, but our basic masses, one of the main bodies of the people. As for small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen who hire shop assistants and apprentices, and who own machines and houses, and run factories and shops, as well as patriotic elements, they are also part of the people. The industry and commerce they run is still necessary for the New Democratic economy. Except for comprador bureaucratic capital, they cannot all be treated as targets of struggle and cannot be confiscated or controlled. In the past, the erroneous struggle against industry and commerce due to the method of class division has already caused serious consequences. "Now many citizens have the idea that capital should not exceed 300,000 yuan," "300,000 yuan has become the boundary between struggle and non-struggle" (see the Taihang Branch's manuscript), "believing that it is better to be poor than rich" (from the Changzhi United Office's manuscript). It can be seen that small and medium-sized industry and commerce have been wrongly attacked in the past. Why has such a bad consequence been created? Today, the leaders of Changzhi City have not received the due correction in their thinking. Chairman Mao said: "Due to the backwardness of the Chinese economy, the capitalist economy represented by the broad petty bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie must still be allowed to exist for a long time, even after the victory of the revolution throughout the country. And according to the division of labor of the national economy, all parts of them that are beneficial to the national economy also need to develop. They are still an indispensable part of the entire national economy." According to the provisions of the Land Law Outline, even the industry and commerce operated by landlords and rich peasants should not be confiscated, but should also be protected by the democratic government. In the past, the wrongly attacked industry and commerce in Changzhi should be publicly reviewed and quickly corrected. However, it can be seen from the recent submissions that many basic concepts have not been reversed, and the rural point of view is still used to treat the city. Urban industry and commerce will continue to be harmed.

    Secondly, precisely because the view of class analysis is wrong, the conclusion that "the development of urban industry and commerce production must also be based on the poor peasant stratum and consolidate the unity of the middle peasant stratum" (from the Changzhi United Office's manuscript) is also wrong. Changzhi believes that the past mistakes were only the result of unilaterally emphasizing the views of the poor peasants and farmhands. Then, is it in line with the Party's class line to propose "basing on the poor peasants and farmhands to unite the middle peasants" for the city today? The city party committee mentioned that "middle peasants can also participate in the leadership if they have technology, but this does not mean that middle peasants hold power," and said that loans are mainly given to poor peasants and farmhands, with appropriate consideration for middle peasants. Thus, agricultural loans were liberally granted in the city in the past, emphasizing the need to solve the difficulties of farm tools and livestock for poor peasants and farmhands, so that citizens had to borrow loans in the name of agricultural loans, not daring to use them during the day, and secretly engaging in industrial and commercial production at night. The most recent loan has been inspected, and it has been explicitly proposed that the city focuses on industry and commerce, and the outside of the city focuses on agriculture. However, from the perspective of the loan effect, agricultural loans accounted for 64 percent, and industrial and commercial loans accounted for only 46 percent. Loans to "poor peasants" accounted for 86 percent, and loans to "middle peasants" (i.e., independent small industrial and commercial producers in the city) accounted for only 14 percent. Other industrial and commercial operators were not within the scope of the loan at all. According to this class line, after harming small and medium-sized industry and commerce, the development of production still excludes industry and commerce from the "poor peasant and farmhand" category. As a result of continuing to apply the anti-feudal methods of rural land reform in the city in this way, industrialists and businessmen will not be given a way out economically and politically, and they will inevitably embark on the road to complete destruction. According to the Party's New Democratic economic program, Chairman Mao instructed to "develop production, prosper the economy, take into account both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital." The guiding principle for urban industry and commerce should be public leadership, the development of private enterprise, the unity of cooperative economy, and the struggle against comprador economy. However, in Changzhi City, an old liberated area, comprador economy has long been eliminated, feudal economy does not occupy a major position, and public industry and commerce have changed the nature of the old city. Even in private industry and commerce, workers and shop assistants are already the masters of society. Although there is still exploitation in private factories, it is different from feudal exploitation in rural areas. The "February 7th" editorial has clearly pointed out that while ensuring the appropriate life of workers and shop assistants, at the same time, in order to prosper the economy and their long-term interests, appropriate profits should also be guaranteed to private industrial and commercial capitalists. The method of struggle cannot be adopted, and only the method of consultation can be adopted under the principle of benefiting both labor and capital. The production of general poor people, small vendors, and small handicraftsmen should naturally be firmly protected and supported, and loans and assistance in finding production avenues should be given to them to facilitate their development. As for the small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen who were wrongly attacked in the past, appropriate compensation should also be adopted to help them restore and develop their businesses. They should not continue to be treated as targets of struggle, and no way out should be given to them politically and economically. In short, the production policy of urban industry and commerce is not about the poor peasants and farmhands holding power and uniting the middle peasants. Because such an erroneous proposition caused most of the small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen to feel that "it is not right to lean forward, and it is not right to lean back" (from the Changzhi United Office's manuscript), "some handicraftsmen and small vendors who do not need land think that it is glorious to be assigned land, and they also ask to be assigned land to become poor peasants and farmhands to avoid struggle." (Taihang Branch's report) Everyone is unwilling to engage in industry and commerce and is willing to go to the countryside to divide land and become poor peasants and farmhands. From the perspective of the development of the entire social economy, this is a retrogression, which is the result of rigidly applying the anti-feudal methods of rural areas.

    Finally, in specific practices, the leaders of Changzhi City have proposed to particularly publicize industrial and commercial policies and mobilize the "middle peasant" stratum to invest boldly in order to achieve the goal of vigorously developing industry and commerce in order to correct the past mistakes, which is certainly necessary. However, we believe that if we do not make a thorough and complete review from the entire guiding ideology, correctly understand the Party's industrial and commercial policies, and boldly admit the left-leaning adventurism caused by the erroneous views of blurring the distinction between rural and urban areas in the past, which has harmed industry and commerce, and resolutely give compensation to those who can be compensated, merely publicizing policies and encouraging investment will still not solve the problem of developing industry and commerce. Urban industry and commerce will continue to be harmed. We hope that the leaders of Changzhi City will give it more careful consideration. It should be stated that because I have not seen many materials and my understanding of the specific situation of Changzhi City may be insufficient, we welcome criticism and correction from the leading comrades of Changzhi City.

### 关于长治市民阶级划分与发展工商业问题

专栏：讨论与研究

    近来我们接到不少读者来信，对于土地改革各方面提出了许多的问题，我们认为很好。有些问题，同时有好几个读者写信来问，可见代表了一部分干部、党员、群众的思想和认识。现在我们打算以一定的篇幅来答复那些带有较普遍性的问题，希望大家有问题继续提出来，但一定要写得具体、明确。这里的答复不见得尽对，大家如有意见，也还可以再提出来讨论和研究。
　
    关于长治市民阶级划分与发展工商业问题
    根据最近长治联合办公室宋克仁、王迅二同志的整理稿，及太行分社关于长治工商业的报导，加上我们其他方面看到的一些材料，我们觉得长治市的领导，对党的工商业政策的认识，还继续过去一套在农村中执行土改政策的观点，兹提出来供大家研究。
    据长市建设科的调查材料，说明长市的生产是以工商业为主，全市上下十几条街，上街的群众是“靠城吃城”，下街就是有相当数量土地的人，其全年总收入，工商业生产占百分之六十至七十。对于这样农业不占重要地位，而在工商业上处于上党地区经济中心的城市，无疑的发展城市工商业具有特别重要意义，但在指导思想上都表现了城、乡观念混淆不清，完全是以农村中反封建斗争方式对待城市工商业。首先表现在对城市阶级分析的观点上，我们认为老解放区的长治市民的阶级成份，应该按其占有生产手段及其生产关系，应区别为工人、农民、贫民、小商贩、小手工业者、中小工商业资本家等；而来稿及我们所看到的“长市导报”等材料，把他们叫做贫雇、中农、地富斗争对象，据市委解释，中农即城市中间阶层，并把他们当作团结和照顾的对象，不能掌权。对于中间阶层以上的人采取什么态度呢？市委提得很明确：“今后对斗争对象照样应管制，但在政治上低头、经济上缴械的条件下，应给他劳动应得的工资”（见三月十六日长市导报第三十三期）。很显然的，把城市的“中间阶层”当作农村的“中农”看待，这种阶级划分方法是错误的。按我们了解，相当于中农（即依靠自己劳动，不剥削别人）的独立手工业者，并非什么中间阶层，而是我们基本群众，是人民大众的主体之一。至于雇用店员、学徒，以及占有机器房屋、开办工厂、贷栈的中小工商业者，以及爱国分子，也是人民大众的一部分，他们所经营的工商业，仍为新民主主义经济所必须，除买办官僚资本外，不能一律当作斗争对象看待，不得没收管制。过去由于阶级划分方法，错斗了工商业，已经造成严重恶果，“现在很多市民存在资本不超过三十万的想法”，“卅万元成了斗与不斗的界限”（见太行分社稿），“认为富不如穷好”（长治联合办公室来稿）。可以看出过去错误地打击了中、小工商业。为什么造成这样的恶果，今天长市的领导在思想上还没有得到应有的纠正。毛主席说：“由于中国经济的落后性，广大的小资产阶级及中等资产阶级所代表的资本主义经济，即使革命在全国胜利之后，一个长时期内，还必须允许他们存在，并且按照国民经济的分工，还需要他们中一切有益于国民经济的部分，有一个发展，他们在整个国民经济中，还是不可缺少的一部分。”照土地法大纲上的规定，即使是地富所经营的工商业，也不应当没收，同样是应当受到民主政府的保护。过去长市错斗的工商业，应该进行公开检讨，迅速纠正，但从最近来稿中看出，许多基本观念还未扭转过来，仍然把农村的观点去对待城市，城市工商业仍然会继续受到损害。
    其次，正因为阶级分析观点有错误，所以得出的“城市的发展工商业生产，也必须是以贫农层为主，并巩固的团结中农层”（长治联合办公室来稿）也是错误的。长市认为过去的错误，只是片面强调贫雇观点的结果。那么，今天对城市提出“以贫雇为主团结中农”是否合乎党的阶级路线呢？市委提到“中农有技术也可以参加领导，这并不等于中农掌权”，并说贷款是以贷给贫雇为主，适当照顾中农，于是过去曾在城市大放农业贷款，强调要给贫雇解决农具牲口困难，弄得市民只好以农贷为名，贷到款后白天不敢动，黑夜偷偷搞工商业生产。最近一次贷款，已是经过检查，单提出城里以工商业为主，城外以农业为主。而从贷款效果上看，农业贷款占百分之六十四，工商业贷款仅占百分之四十六，“贫农”贷款占百分之八十六，“中农”（即城市独立的小工商业生产者）仅占百分之十四，其他工商业经营者，根本不在贷款范围之内。根据这条阶级路线，在伤害中小工商业之后，发展生产，仍然是把工商业排斥于“贫雇”的门外。这样在城市中继续搬用农村土改中反封建办法的结果，在经济上和政治上都不能给工商业者以出路，必然走上完全毁灭的道路。根据党的新民主主义的经济纲领，毛主席所指示的是“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”。城市工商业的指导方针，应当是公营领导，发展民营，团结合作经济，向买办经济斗争。而老解放区的长治市，今天买办经济早已消灭，封建经济不占什么主要地位，公营工商业已经改变了旧城市的性质。即使在私营的工商业中，工人店员已是社会的主人翁，在私人工厂，虽然还有剥削，但已不同于农村中的封建剥削，“二七”社论已明白指出在保证工人店员的适当生活下，同时，为了繁荣经济及他们的长远利益，也应当保证私人工商业资本家适当的利润，不能采取斗争方式，只能在劳资两利的原则下采取协商方式解决。对于一般贫民、小商贩、小手工业者的生产，自然应当坚决保护扶助，给以贷款及帮助找寻生产门路等种种便利，使他们得到发展。而对于过去错斗了的中小工商业者，也应当采取适当补偿，帮助其恢复并发展营业，不能仍当斗争对象看待，在政治上加以管制，经济上不给予任何出路。总而言之，城市工商业的生产方针，并不是什么贫雇掌权，团结中农的问题。因为这样的错误提法，引起大部分中小工商业者觉着“靠前不对，靠后不是”（长治联合办公室来稿），“一些本不需要土地的手工业者、小摊贩等，认为分上土地才是光荣，也要求分土地当贫雇，以免斗争”。（太行分社报导）大家都不愿经营工商业了，都愿意到农村去分土地，当贫雇。从整个社会经济的发展上着眼，这是一种倒退，是硬搬农村反封建办法的结果。
    最后，在具体作法上，长市领导为了纠正过去的错误，提出要特别宣传工商业政策，发动“中农”层大胆投资，以达大力发展工商业的目的，这固然是必要的。但是，我们认为假如不从整个指导思想上痛切的作全盘彻底的检讨，正确认识党的工商业政策，对于过去农村城市混淆不清的错误观点所引起的左倾冒险，以致伤害了工商业的错误，不大胆承认，能赔偿的坚决给以赔偿，光是宣传政策，鼓励投资，仍然不能解决发展工商业的问题，城市工商业仍将继续受到损害。我们希望长市领导方面再加以慎重考虑。应该声明的，因为我所看到的材料不多，对长市具体情况的了解，可能有不够的地方，我们欢迎长市领导同志的批评指正。
