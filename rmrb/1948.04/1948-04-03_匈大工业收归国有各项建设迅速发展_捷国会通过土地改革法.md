Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Budapest Dispatch: The Hungarian Council of Ministers passed the Industrial Nationalization Act on March 25th, stipulating that all factories and enterprises employing more than 100 workers, with the exception of those owned by foreigners, shall be nationalized. The government will provide appropriate compensation to the original business owners. This decree will affect one-half of all Hungarian industry. According to State Secretary Nogradi at a press conference on March 25th, the purpose of this bill is to successfully complete and surpass the Three-Year Plan. Nogradi emphasized that the law does not apply to small factories and businesses, and pointed out that the construction work and further development of large enterprises will promote the prosperity of small enterprises. Since the implementation of the Three-Year Plan on August 1st of last year, Hungary's industrial, agricultural, and mining development has been extremely rapid. Major industries have reached pre-war levels. Coal mining in the first six months has exceeded the plan by 18 percent, and production has reached the level expected in 1950. The largest coking plant in Hungary was completed and put into operation at the end of January, six months ahead of the original plan, with a daily production capacity of 40 truckloads of coking coal. The great project of excavating a canal between the Danube and Tisza rivers began this month, and when completed, it will irrigate 45,000 Hungarian acres (equivalent to 320,000 Chinese acres). In terms of finance, since the nationalization of major banks last November, finance has become more stable. The budget execution last year resulted in a balanced income and expenditure, which is the first time in Hungarian history that there has been a deficit-free budget. This year's budget revenue is 7,576 million Hungarian currency, with a surplus of 23 million Hungarian currency.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: Prague Dispatch: The Czechoslovak Parliament passed the Land Reform Law on the 22nd, stipulating the requisition of all privately owned land exceeding 50 hectares and its distribution to landless and land-poor peasants, truly realizing "land to the tillers." Furthermore, the parliament is about to pass a new "Industrial Nationalization" bill, which will nationalize 93 percent of the factories. The living standards of the Czech working people are rising day by day. The new government has ordered that the bread ration be increased by one kilogram per person per month starting from March 1st, and another one kilogram from April 5th. It has also ordered an increase in the salaries of employees of various agencies and a reduction in taxes for small and medium-sized farmers and handicraftsmen.
