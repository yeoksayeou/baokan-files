    Qinghe County Distributes Fruits of Victory,
    Old Ideological Work Styles Not Yet Eliminated

    [This newspaper dispatch] Since land reform last year, Qinghe County, Jinnan, has accumulated many fruits of the mass struggle that have not yet been distributed. This March, in conjunction with the central task (spring plowing), a universal distribution was carried out. Many districts and villages have already completed the distribution, while others are continuing. According to the Qinghe County Party Committee's work summary for March, the following errors and shortcomings occurred in the distribution of fruits and the adjustment and allocation of land (original text): 1. The method of distributing the fruits was incorrect, and the accounting was inaccurate. Some only involved self-reporting without public discussion, creating a situation where those who reported honestly suffered, and those who were cunning and underreported benefited (Xujiana in the First District, Qianwei in the Fourth District, etc.). Some still distributed according to the old circles of three grades and nine classes. In particular, in Qiansunzhuang in the Fourth District, the first grade received 96 catties of grain per person, the second grade 76 catties, and the third grade 50 catties. Sun Mingke's family had thirteen people, more than twenty mu of land, regularly fed a large ox, had three full laborers and six semi-laborers, and stored more than 2,000 catties of grain. This time, they received another 975 catties, while the elderly, weak, and orphans received very little. 2. Bad village cadres took control, engaging in sectarianism, selfishness, and failing to distinguish between enemies and friends. In Lujiana in the First District, poor peasants outside the group were not allowed to share the fruits of victory, and fighting broke out in Jia Village during land distribution. Especially in the adjustment of fruits, because we were too eager and the scope of adjustment was too broad, we did not understand and consider the actual situation of the villages being adjusted out, and we did not do enough to break through the masses' thinking, which led some bad village cadres to seize upon the feudal conservative thinking of the masses that "no one should benefit from outside villages," and use methods of false reporting, secret distribution, and open resistance to please the poor peasants, while concealing their own crimes of stealing and forcibly occupying the fruits of the masses. Xuna Village feared the adjustment of fruits to other villages, so each family distributed according to one more person. Donggaozhuang feared adjusting fruits to Huangjinzhuang, so they engaged in sectarianism and distributed the same amount to both the denounced households, regardless of whether they bowed their heads or not, as to the poor peasants. Houguotun in the Fourth District did not understand the adjustment of fruits, so the rich and poor were divided equally, one share per person. After publicly leading the masses to expel the village cadres, the people of D渡口驿渡口驿 Village jointly petitioned the district. Xu Village in the Fifth District concealed the good land and only offered the bad land. 3. Some villages' masses have misunderstandings about the policy of leaving some land for landlords to facilitate labor and life. A common bias in the First District was that all denounced households (landlords, rich peasants, or denounced middle peasants) were given less land or bad land. Wangzui Village averaged 3.4 mu per person, of which 2.5 mu was good land, and the bad land was worth no more than one mu. However, for the denounced households, regardless of whether they bowed their heads or not, they were uniformly given one mu of good land and two mu of bad land. When Sijiawu in the Third District bestowed a piece of land to the landlord, it was the land that the landlord had previously pawned. Because the landlord was denounced and had no money to redeem the land, he still had no land to produce. However, our village cadres clearly knew that the masses were doing something wrong, but they did not actively educate and lead the masses to correct it, but instead adopted a tailist attitude of "masses' opinions, cannot be taken over" and let it go. 4. Some villages did not take care of special problems. For example, Louzhuang in the Second District provided very poor care for the elderly, weak, and orphans. In Sanmachang, two middle and poor peasant families were starving due to weddings, funerals, and illnesses, and no care was added. In a certain village in the First District, the share that the soldiers themselves deserved was not distributed, which was wrong."

    Editor's Note:
    This material not only reflects the "leftist" thinking, sectarian emotions, and the continued existence of the rich peasant line in the allocation among the village cadres in Qinghe District, the filling of soil on the mounds and the careless work style, but also reflects some unconsciousness in the leadership. First of all, the comrades of the County Party Committee also have "leftist" ideological emotions, and their research on policies is also very insufficient. They repeatedly blamed the cadres for "regardless of whether the denounced households bowed their heads or not," as if there was no mistake or a very small mistake as long as they paid attention to "whether they bowed their heads or not." However, first, the term "denounced household" itself is ambiguous, including landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, and even poor peasants. If they are middle and poor peasants, then we have denounced them wrongly, why should they bow their heads? Second, if it is said that landlords and rich peasants do not bow their heads, is this not bowing their heads politically? Or is it not surrendering economically? If it is political, we must continue to fight against them politically, but can we not divide or leave an equal share according to the policy economically? Of course, this is not possible. Secondly, after pointing out the above phenomena, the comrades of the County Party Committee only generally put forward the methods and policies for future distribution, but did not mention a word about what had already been wrong (such as giving bad land to middle peasants who were wrongly denounced), which is inappropriate.

### 清河县分配果实中  旧思想作风未肃清

    清河县分配果实中
    旧思想作风未肃清
    【本报消息】冀南清河县去年土地改革以来的群众斗争果实很多未分。今春三月，乃结合中心工作（春耕），进行普遍分配。许多区村已经分完，有的还在继续分配。根据该县县委三月份工作总结，分果实与调剂分配土地中发生了以下一些错误与缺点（原文）：一、分果实方法不对头，填补不准确。有的只自报不公议，形成谁报的实谁吃亏，谁狡猾少报就沾光（一区许家那，四区前位等村）。有的仍按三等九级的旧圈子分配。特别是四区前孙庄，一级每人粮九十六斤，二级七十六斤，三级五十斤。孙明珂家十三口人，二十多亩大地，常喂一个大牛，有三个整劳力，六个半劳力，存现粮两千多斤，这回又分九七五斤，老弱孤寡倒分的很少。二、坏村干把持，宗派，自私，敌友不分。一区路家那贫农不让组外的贫雇分果实，贾庄分土地打起架来。特别是在调剂果实上，由于我们的心太热，调剂范围太广，对往外调剂村的实际情况了解与照顾差，对群众思想打通工作做的不够，致使某些坏村干抓住群众“便宜不到外村”的封建保守思想，利用假报、偷分、公开抵抗的办法，讨好于贫农，而掩盖其（自己）偷盗强占群众果实的罪恶。许那村怕往外村调剂果实，每家多按一口人分。东高庄怕向黄金庄调剂果实，一面闹宗派，一面不管被斗户低头不低头同贫农一样分。四区后郭屯对调剂果实不通，故穷富一样分，每人一份。渡口驿村公开领导群众驱逐坐村干部后，一同到区请愿。五区徐村把好地瞒下，专献坏地。三、给地主留些土地，以便劳动生活的政策，有些村群众思想不通。一区普遍发生的偏向是：凡被斗户（地富或被斗的中农）一律少分地或坏地。王嘴每人平均三亩四分，其中二亩半系好地，折的坏地不过一亩。而对被斗户，不管低头不低头，统给一亩好地，二亩折成的坏地。三区四家务恩赐地主一份土地时，乃给地主原先出当的土地。因地主被斗，没钱赎地，还是无地生产。但我坐村干部明知群众做的有毛病，不积极教育，领导群众改过来，却以“群众意见，不能包办”的尾巴主义态度听之任之。四、有的村对特殊问题不做照顾。如二区楼庄对老弱孤寡照顾很差，三马厂两家因婚丧病人而致挨饿的中、贫农，没加任何照顾。一区某村对军人本人应得的一份亦未分给，这是不对的。”
    编者按：
    这个材料，不仅反映清河区村干部中存在着“左”的思想、宗派情绪及分配中仍存在着富农路线，圪堆上填土与不慎重作风，但也反映了一些领导上的不自觉。首先，县委同志同样存在着“左”的思想情绪，对政策的研究也很不够。他们一再责备干部“不管被斗户低头不低头”，似乎只要注意到“低头不低头”就没有错或错误很小了。但是，第一、“被斗户”这一名词本身就是含混的，其中有地主，有富农，也有中农，甚至有贫农。如果是中、贫农，那是我们斗错了，为什么要人家低头？第二、如果说是地主富农不低头，这是政治上不低头呢？还是经济上不缴械呢？如系政治上的，我们在政治上必须继续与其斗争，但经济上是不是就可以不依照政策分给或留给同等一份呢？这当然是不可以的。其次，县委同志在指出上述现象后，只一般地提出以后分配的办法与方针，对已经错了的（如给错斗中农也分坏地等），一字未提，是不妥的。
