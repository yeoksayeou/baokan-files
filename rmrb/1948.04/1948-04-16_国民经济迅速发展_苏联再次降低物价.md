　　Rapid National Economic Development
  　Soviet Union Lowers Prices Again
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th] Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Council of Ministers announced a resolution on the 9th, ordering another reduction in the unified state retail prices of certain foods and consumer goods. The resolution pointed out that along with the monetary reform of December 16, 1947, the government had abolished the rationing system for food and daily necessities, eliminated the high commercial prices, and lowered the unified state retail prices of food and consumer goods, which was only the beginning of lowering the prices of food and consumer goods. Due to the general development of the national economy and the rapid increase in the production of consumer goods, the Council of Ministers believes that it is necessary to implement the second stage of price reductions to further increase the real wages of factory and office workers, increase the income of farmers, and increase the purchasing power of the ruble. From April 10th, the state retail commercial prices of various goods will be reduced by 10 to 20 percent, including "Moskvich" brand cars, motorcycles, bicycles, radios, gramophones, sewing machines, watches, spices, cigarettes, cigars, beverages, wine, beer, caviar, etc.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th] Moscow dispatch: Soviet newspapers have successively published articles praising the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers to lower prices. The Izvestia editorial on the 9th stated: In order to improve the people's living standards, the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government constantly pay attention to increasing the supply of food and consumer goods, while in capitalist countries, inflation continues to expand, prices continue to rise, and the living standards of millions of workers and peasants continue to decline; this proves that the Soviet system has created favorable conditions for the development of productive forces, thus enabling continuous improvement of people's welfare, but capitalist countries are the opposite. The self-sacrificing efforts of the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union in the post-war construction work have enabled the Soviet people to enjoy the fruits of their labor more and more every day. The decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers will inspire the Soviet people to create more achievements for the glory of the motherland. The Pravda editorial listed production figures for the first quarter of this year, explaining: "This new price reduction is the result of the large-scale development of the Soviet national economy and the substantial increase in consumer goods."

　　国民经济迅速发展
  　苏联再次降低物价
    【新华社陕北十三日电】莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议九日公布决议，下令再次降低若干食品与消费品的统一国定零售价格。决议指出：与一九四七年十二月十六日的货币改革同时，政府已取消了食品与日用必需品的配给制，取消了高昂的商场价格，降低了食品与消费品的统一国定零售价格，这只是降低食品与消费品价格的开始。由于国民经济的普遍发展与消费品生产的迅速增加，部长会议认为必须实现第二阶段的降低物价，以进一步提高工厂与机关员工的实际工资，增加农民的收入和提高卢布的购买力。自四月十日起多种货品的国定零售商业价格，将降低百分之十到二十，其中计有“莫斯科人”牌汽车，机器自行车、自行车、收音机、留声机、缝纫机、表、香料、纸烟、雪茄、饮料、酒、啤酒、鱼子酱等等。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】莫斯科讯：苏联各报纷纷撰论赞扬苏联部长会议降低物价的决定。消息报九日社论称：布尔什维克党和苏维埃政府为了提高人民的生活水平，不断注意增加食品与消费品的供应，而在资本主义国家，则通货不断膨胀，物价不断上涨，千百万工农大众的生活水平不断下跌；这证明苏维埃制度为生产力的发展造成了有利条件，因而得以不断增进人民福利，但资本主义国家则反此。苏联各族人民在战后建设工作中的自我牺牲的努力，使苏联人民得以一天比一天更多地享受自己劳动的成果。苏联部长会议的这一决定，将鼓舞苏联人民为祖国的光荣而创造更多的功绩。真理报社论则列举今年第一季生产数字说明：“这次新的降低物价，是由于苏联国民经济的大规模发展和消费品大量增加的结果。”
