To the Editor:

    How should all expenses be handled when military dependents go to the front to see soldiers? Should the transfer of family members be stopped? In Zhangnan County, an average of five or six family members go to the front to see soldiers every day. If they arrive before noon, they stay overnight; if they arrive after noon, they need meals and accommodation. Accommodation and lamp oil for overnight stays and meals are also problems. The current system is very strict, so how should these expenses be handled? Also, they still request large carts to transport them back and forth along the way. Now is the spring plowing season, and the masses are very busy. In particular, the masses in Zhangnan are suffering from severe famine and are engaged in production to overcome the famine. If this continues, it will hinder the masses' production and famine relief. I suggest it is best to wait before visiting again. If they must visit, it is best to solve these problems themselves. Please advise if this is correct.

To Comrade Tang Wei:
    Regarding your letter concerning how all expenses should be handled when military dependents go to the front to see soldiers, and whether the transfer of family members should be stopped, we agree with your suggestion to persuade military dependents to visit later, or write a letter to inquire. Now is the spring plowing season for production and famine relief, and all villages are concentrating their efforts on production and famine relief. If the soldiers' stationed location is very close and the military dependents still want to visit, then all expenses and issues related to livestock and vehicles should be resolved by the military dependents themselves. According to the Border Region War Support Decision, "transferring family members" is not within the scope of allocated support and should not involve requesting or drawing support.

### 军属去看战士不能随便要差

    军属去看战士不能随便要差编辑同志：
    军属到前方看战士，一切开支如何办？转送家属是否可以停呢？漳南县政府，每天平均有家属五、六个人到前方看战士，来到这里不过午就住夜，过午住宿就吃饭，住宿灯油吃饭也是问题，现在制度又很严格，这笔开支如何办？请答复。另外，还是沿途要大车来回转送，现在春耕季节，群众是十分很忙，特别是漳南群众灾荒严重，群众正在生产渡荒，如果这样继续下去，有碍群众生产渡荒，我建议最好是待后再看，如要看的话，这些问题也最好是自己解决，对否请答复。
            （堂巍）堂巍同志：
    来信谈到关于军属到前方看战士一切开支如何办？转送家属是否可以停？我们同意你的意见劝解军属以后再看，或写信去问。现正是春耕生产渡荒时节，各村正集中力量生产渡荒。战士驻地很近，军属又愿意去看，那么一切费用及牲口车辆等问题都应由军属自己解决。按边区战勤决定“转送家属”是不在拨差范围以内的，是不应要差或支差的。
