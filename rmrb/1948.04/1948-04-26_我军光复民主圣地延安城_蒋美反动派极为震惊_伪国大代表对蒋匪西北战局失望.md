Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Nanjing, 22nd—The People's Liberation Army's liberation of the democratic holy land of Yan'an has caused great shock within the counter-revolutionary camp in Nanjing. According to the Associated Press, this matter "injected an unexpected atmosphere into the (pseudo) National Assembly, and the 'representatives' were startled when they read the news of the government's (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's) withdrawal from Yan'an. Many privately expressed disappointment with the government's (Chiang Kai-shek's) failure." United Press International exclaimed in alarm: "The loss of Yan'an is a major blow to the morale of the Kuomintang army." The agency also admitted that the Kuomintang garrison in Yan'an fled in a panic because they were facing death under the powerful offensive of the Northwest People's Liberation Army: "Kuomintang sources said that after the Communist army occupied Yichuan, fifty miles southeast of Yan'an, and defeated (note: should be read as annihilated) two Kuomintang divisions, the government's (Chiang Kai-shek's) military positions in Yan'an were no longer easy to defend." The Associated Press also acknowledged that "the abandonment of Yan'an paints a picture of the seriousness of the overall situation for the Kuomintang in Northwest China," and stated that "the area liberated by the Communist army is larger than their past base in Shaanxi."

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 24th: (1) The local troops of the first sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, on the 18th, captured Yangquan Town, thirty miles southwest of @ County. In a one-hour battle, they killed or wounded 31 enemy district chiefs and puppet police officers, and captured 40 alive. They seized one light machine gun, 54 rifles and pistols, and some ammunition. (2) The local troops of the second sub-district, on the 19th, captured Gaojia @, forty miles east of Dongsheng, and annihilated part of the First Regiment of the Meng bandit police regiment, capturing more than 60 enemies, and seizing two machine guns and more than ten war horses. This enemy collapsed when our army penetrated southern Sui and annihilated its regimental headquarters at Shenshan on the 11th. Our army immediately pursued them, and the enemy ultimately did not escape their fate of being annihilated.

    我军光复民主圣地延安城
    蒋美反动派极为震惊
    伪国大代表对蒋匪西北战局失望
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】南京二十二日讯：人民解放军光复民主圣地延安、引起了南京反革命阵营的莫大震惊。据美联社称：此事“将没有料想到的气氛注入了（伪）国大，‘代表’们读到了政府（指蒋匪）撤出延安的消息，吓了一跳。许多人对政府（蒋匪）的失败，都私下表示失望”。合众社则惊叫：“延安的失守，对国民党军说来，是士气上的大失败”。该社并承认，延安蒋匪守军的狼狈逃窜，是由于他们在西北人民解放军强大进攻下已面临死亡命运：“国民党人士称：当共军占领延安东南五十哩的宜川，击溃（按：应读为歼灭）国民党两个师后，延安的政府（蒋匪）军阵地已不易防守”。美联社亦承认：“延安的放弃，绘画出了国民党在中国西北全盘形势的严重性”。并谓“共军所光复的地方比过去他们在陕西的根据地还要大”。
    【新华社西北二十四日电】（一）陕甘宁一分区地方兵团，十八日攻克＠县西南三十里之羊泉镇，战斗一小时，毙伤敌区长及伪警人员三十一名，生俘四十名。缴轻机枪一挺，长短枪五十四支，弹药一部。（二）二分区地方兵团于十九日攻克东胜以东四十里之高家＠，歼蒙匪警备师第一团一部，俘敌六十余名，缴机枪两挺，战马十余匹。该敌于十一日当我军挺入绥南在神山歼其师部时溃逃。我军即跟踪追击，该敌终未逃脱就歼命运。
