　　Taihang Fourth Prefectural Committee Instructs Counties
  　To Thoroughly Clear Up Production of Government Organs
    [Taihang News] The Taihang Fourth Prefectural Committee's Clearing Committee, in order to correctly implement the Central Bureau and Regional Party Committee's decisions and instructions on clearing up the production of government organs, specifically instructed all subordinate counties on the 12th of this month to organize sound clearing agencies and thoroughly carry out the clearing work. In addition to stipulating specific steps and clearing methods, the Prefectural Committee's Clearing Committee has organized three working groups to go to various places to be responsible for inspection, reception, and organizing the maintenance of the market. The instruction pointed out: "Since our region proposed clearing up the production of government organs, many chaotic phenomena have occurred below due to everyone's insufficient understanding of its spirit. Some organs even concealed property during the clearing process, attempting to grab a piece. Production personnel are concerned about their personal work issues, and worse, some shops are still eating and drinking extravagantly, engaging in corruption and waste, and sitting and waiting to be cleared. For this reason, the following is specifically stipulated: (1) Sub-districts: Under the sub-district clearing committees, a total of five areas will be divided for inspection and reception, and will be responsible for organizing the reception and rectification of shops, transferring management, continuing operations, and maintaining the market. (2) Organs: First, be responsible for systematic clearing, and the secretaries of each department must be responsible for carrying out systematic clearing work. The clearing team will educate the cadres of the shops and be responsible for organizing continued operations before the reception. (3) Counties: The clearing committees of each county must organize themselves to work independently, and organize several inspection teams to be responsible for inspecting the production and property of each unit within the county, as well as assisting the clearing committee in reviewing cadres and studying and deciding on which shops can be retained for continued operation. Inspection, clearing, and reception should be carried out simultaneously, and generally it is required to complete the reception before April 15th." Currently, the three working groups of the District Committee Clearing Committee will go to each designated area to directly carry out clearing and reception work. Wen County, Lingchuan, Qinyang, Xiuwu and other counties have also established clearing committees and started office work, and the remaining counties are also actively organizing the establishment of clearing committees, deploying work, and preparing to carry out the work.
