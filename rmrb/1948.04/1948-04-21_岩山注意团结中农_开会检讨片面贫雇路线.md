　　[Taiyue News] Cadres of Yanshan Village, Sixth District of Yangcheng, held a meeting of party members and cadres after returning from a county meeting on the 3rd, to review their attitude towards middle peasants during the re-examination in the winter of last year. In the past, the "pro-poor peasant and hired laborer line" was overemphasized, harming the middle peasants. For example, the land of middle peasants was taken without their consent. After middle peasant Shangguan Tingkui had several mu of land taken, he became uncooperative and complained to labor hero Shangguan Zhongyou, saying, "I was fooled by you. You kept telling me to follow Shi Zhenming's path to get rich, but after we endured hunger and bought a few mu of land with great difficulty, it was taken away. What's the point of working!" Last year, middle peasant Shangguan Duikui earned several work points in the mutual aid team, entitling him to four dou and two sheng of rice, but the team refused to give it to him. Hired laborer Shangguan Wankui even said, "What is your class status that you want wage rice?" Therefore, he asked to withdraw from the mutual aid team. When the cadres reviewed this point, they all said, "This is a separation of the poor, hired, and middle peasants, which is very dangerous! We must mobilize the middle peasants to boldly speak their minds, and problems that were truly handled inappropriately in the past can be re-examined in the future." Afterwards, they also reviewed the work attitude of the cadres and party members, who were afraid of making mistakes and dared not lead. Then, mobilization was carried out in the night schools of various natural villages. Middle peasant Li Xiangzhu said, "As long as it is clarified that we, the middle and poor peasants, are still a family, and we can speak our minds, we can produce well in the future." Middle peasant Shangguan Yi said, "The cadres have been saying that whoever makes trouble is the one who suffers, so what worries do we have?" Since then, emotions have gradually stabilized. The reorganized mutual aid teams some time ago have finally played a role, carrying manure and plowing the land in groups, working with great enthusiasm. Eighty percent of the manure for 1,500 mu of grain land has been carried in ten days, and it would have been delivered completely if it hadn't rained.

　　岩山注意团结中农
  　开会检讨片面贫雇路线
    【太岳消息】阳城六区岩山村干部三号从县里开会回来，开了个党员和干部大会，检讨了去年冬天复查中对待中农的态度。过去因为片面强调“贫雇路线”，伤害了中农。比如，不经过中农同意，就抽了中农的土地。中农上官廷奎被抽了几亩地，就不好好动弹了，还埋怨劳动英雄上官中有说：“可上了你的当啦，成天说叫我走石振明的路发财致富，咱忍饥受饿，好容易买了几亩地就给抽走了，这还劳动个啥哩！”中农上官队奎去年在互助组里长出了几个工，该得四斗二升米，组里就不给。雇贫上官万奎还说：“你是什么成份，还要工资米？”因此他就要求退出互助组。干部们检讨到这点，都说：“这是贫雇中农分了家，很危险呀！咱们要动员中农大胆说出心头话，过去真正处理不合适的问题，往后可以重新处理。”以后又检讨了一下干部和党员的工作态度，害怕出岔，不敢领导。接着，就在各自然村的夜校里作了动员，中农李香柱说：“只要说明咱中贫农还是一家人，让把心病话说一说，今后咱就能好好生产”。中农上官义说：“干部们一直宣传谁闹上是谁的，咱还有什么顾虑。”从此情绪逐渐稳定。前些时候整顿的互助组，这才起了作用，成群结伙的担粪、犁地，圪嚷得一股劲，一千五百亩谷地粪，十天已担起了八成，要不是下雨，早就送齐了。
