　　Quickly Stand Up and Lead the Masses in Production
    Today's newspaper reports that Party members and cadres in Matou Village, Er District, Yuanchao, have dispelled their ideological concerns, changed their work style, taken active action, and proactively solved difficulties for the masses, leading the masses to organize themselves for production. This exemplary action provides a very good example for our Party members and cadres, and solves two problems for us: First, the issue of whether the masses want us or not. Comrade Ye Heling, the village head, reflected well: "It's not a question of whether the masses want us or not, but whether we want the masses. If we transform ourselves well and do good things for the masses, the masses will not reject us." Second, they did not lie down and do nothing, but corrected their mistakes proactively, solving difficulties for the masses, and "finding targets themselves" to help each other with the masses, organizing everyone to engage in production properly, and transforming themselves in production.
    However, according to recent submissions from various places, many Party members and cadres are not doing this. They are still lying down and not moving, waiting to be asked by the masses to move their "stones." In the past, many Party members and cadres did not serve the masses well, but instead abused their power and acted like overlords, offending the masses. Therefore, at the beginning of the Party rectification and democratic movement, they became afraid, saying that the masses did not want them anymore, and that they were waiting to be "rectified" and "brought to the people's court." This idea is wrong. We have repeatedly said that acknowledging and correcting mistakes is the way out. If you were wrong in the past, don't continue to be wrong now. It is currently the time for spring plowing, and we should immediately muster our energy, lead and organize the masses well, solve difficulties for the masses, and do a good job in production. In this way, big mistakes can be reduced, small mistakes will be forgiven by the masses, and those who have not made mistakes will be supported by the masses even more. We must learn from the exemplary actions of Party members and cadres in Matou Village, Yuanchao. If you still lie down and do nothing, it is tantamount to adding mistakes to mistakes. Finally, let me make it clear to everyone: The Party rectification and democratic movement adopts the policy of curing diseases and saving people for every Party member and cadre. It distinguishes between right and wrong, and differentiates between the size of mistakes. Everything must be clarified, and no one will be wronged. Party members and cadres must correct their mistakes, but it does not mean that all Party members and cadres will be sent to the people's court.
    This year's spring is shallow, so quickly stand up and lead the masses in production. Doing a good job in production is contributing to the masses. Transforming yourself in production is the way out.

### 赶快站起来领导群众生产

　　赶快站起来领导群众生产
    今天报载元朝二区马头村党员干部，解除自己思想顾虑，转变作风，积极行动起来，主动的去给群众解决困难，领导群众组织起来生产。这一模范行动，给我们党员干部指出了一个很好的榜样，给我们解决了两个问题：一、是群众要咱不要咱的问题。村长叶合领同志反省的好：“不是群众要咱不要咱，而是咱要不要群众。如果咱好好转变，为群众好好办事，群众不会不要咱的”。二、他们没有躺倒不干，而是知错改错，主动去给群众解决困难，并“自找对象”和群众互助，把大家组织起来，好好闹生产，在生产中改造自己。
    但最近从各地来稿看来，很多党员干部不是这样做的。他们仍在躺着不动，等着叫群众搬自己的“石头”。过去有很多党员干部，没有给群众当好长工，反而仗势欺人，作威作福，得罪了群众。所以整党民主运动一开始，他们即害怕起来，说群众不要他们了，等着“挨整”吧，“上人民法庭”吧。这种想法是不对的。我们一再说过，知过改过，才是出路。过去错了，现在再不要继续错下去。目前正是春耕时候，我们应该马上鼓起劲来，好好领导组织群众，给群众解决困难，把生产搞好，这样错大的可以减轻，错小的群众也会原谅，没有错的，更会得到群众拥护。要学习元朝马头村党员干部的模范行动。如果仍然躺着不动，那就等于错上加错。最后再向大家讲明：整党民主运动，对待每个党员干部都采取治病救人的方针，是非分明，错分大小，都要弄得清清楚楚，绝冤屈不了一个人。干部党员有错必须改正，但并不是把党员干部一律都送人民法庭。
    今年春浅，赶快站起来，领导群众生产。搞好生产，就给群众立下功劳。在生产中改造自己，就有出路。
