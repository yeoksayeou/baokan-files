    Hu Zongnan's Bandit Troops Utterly Crushed on the Northern Front
    Victory in the Struggle to Liberate the Great Northwest Begins
    April 22nd to 28th

    "We have indeed returned!" In the past week, the military and civilians of the entire liberated area have celebrated the recovery of Yan'an, the sacred land of democracy, with this feeling of pride.

    Since the Northwest People's Liberation Army proactively withdrew from Yan'an on March 19th of last year, the military and civilians of the Northwest, under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, have overcome enormous difficulties and grown stronger in battle. Over the past year, they have annihilated over 100,000 of the Kuomintang bandit troops and victoriously marched towards the Chiang-controlled areas. This has enabled the Northwest military and civilians, after one year, one month, and three days, to finally kick the Kuomintang bandit troops out of Yan'an.

    The great victory of recovering Yan'an is a tremendous encouragement to the military and civilians of the entire liberated area because it further proves that the Chinese people will inevitably win and signifies that complete and thorough victory is not far off. This great victory is a tremendous blow to the American imperialist Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the Kuomintang bandit troops because it proves that no amount of aid from American imperialism can save Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang, and it foreshadows that the rising sun of people's democratic forces, with the military and civilians of the liberated area as the main force, will now more powerfully and quickly thoroughly crush the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang.

    Under the immensely powerful offensive of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, the Northwest battlefield has undergone rapid and drastic changes. Following the recovery of Yan'an, the People's Liberation Army went south to directly capture Luochuan, causing the complete collapse of the northern front of Hu Zongnan's bandit troops. The People's Liberation Army, marching towards the Jing River and Wei River basin, swept away the enemy like leaves in the wind. In the ten days from the 17th to the 26th, they captured eleven cities in a row, namely, ＠yi, Yongshou, ＠ county, Linуou, Fufeng, Lingtai, Changwu, Fengxiang, Qishan, and Baoji, as well as many important towns such as Yongle, Benzhang, Wenshu (also known as Wenshu), Caijiapo, and Haozhen. The People's Liberation Army also controlled over 300 li of the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway, and over 140 li each of the Xi'an-Baoji highway and the Longhai Railway, cutting off the connection between Xi'an and Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. Under such a fierce assault by the People's Liberation Army, Hu bandit's western front is also rapidly collapsing. Now the powerful offensive of the Northwest People's Liberation Army is in full swing, and the glorious and great struggle to liberate the Great Northwest is unfolding in a comprehensive victory.

    The East China People's Liberation Army, after achieving brilliant victories in the western section of the Jiaoji Railway, captured Weixian City on the 27th, completely annihilating the enemy's 45th Division headquarters, another complete brigade, a complete regiment, and four security regiments. Our army began a fierce mopping-up campaign in the Chang (Le) Wei (County) An (Qiu) area of the central section of the Jiaoji Railway from the 2nd to the 12th. In eleven days, we annihilated more than 2,000 Chiang bandit troops, removed more than 70 Chiang bandit strongholds, and successively recovered Weixian's airport and power plant, as well as the important coal mining area and Fangzi Town station southeast of Weixian City. Chiang bandits reinforced from both the east and west on the 7th and 10th but were repelled by us. Now that Weixian has been captured, the Chiang bandits in Chang'an and other places are even more isolated and surrounded by us. The Huaibei local armed forces once captured Siyang City on the 10th.

    The People's Liberation Army in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui area completely annihilated the entire 2,400 men of Chiang bandit's New 17th Brigade in Songhe and Sanyangdian, northeast of Jingshan, on the 17th. On the 16th, the local armed forces annihilated the majority of the 244th Regiment of Chiang bandit's 82nd Brigade in Sujiagang, west of Qianjiang, capturing more than 500 people. On the same day, they once again recovered Junxian in northwestern Hubei. The local armed forces in various places also launched extensive attacks and frequently captured prisoners. These victories show that the military and civilians who painstakingly created the Hubei-Henan-Anhui liberated area are growing stronger day by day.

    On the Jicha-Rehe-Liaoning battlefield, the Sixth Division, recently formed and advancing into southern Rehe under General Han Meicun, won a victory east of Pingquan on the 9th, annihilating most of the local bandit puppet police corps self-defense force, and annihilating a battalion of Chiang bandit's 89th Division that came to reinforce.

### 胡宗南匪军北线全部溃灭  解放大西北斗争胜利开展

    胡宗南匪军北线全部溃灭
    解放大西北斗争胜利开展
    四月廿二日至廿八日
    “我们果然回来了”，一周来全解放区的军民在这种自豪的心情下，欢腾庆祝民主圣地延安的收复。
    自去年三月十九日西北解放军主动撤出延安后，西北军民即在毛主席和中共中央的直接领导下，克服巨大困难，愈战愈强。一年来，歼灭国民党匪军十万余众，并向蒋管区胜利进军，这就使西北军民在一年一月零三天之后，终于把国民党匪军一脚踢出了延安。
    延安收复这一伟大胜利，对整个解放区军民是莫大的鼓舞，因为它更加证明了中国人民必然胜利，并标志着全面的彻底的胜利已不很远。这一伟大胜利对美帝国主义蒋匪介石及国民党匪军是一个莫大的打击，因为它证明了任何美帝国主义的援助，都已挽救不了蒋介石国民党，并预示着如日之升的以解放区军民为主的人民民主力量，今后将更有力的更快的把蒋介石国民党的反动统治彻底摧垮。
    在西北人民解放军强大无比的进攻下，西北战场已起了迅速剧烈的变化。继收复延安后，解放军即南下直取洛川，使胡宗南匪军的北线全部溃灭；而向泾渭流域进军的解放军，则以风扫落叶之势，自十七日至二十六日的十日间，连下十一城，即＠邑、永寿、＠县、麟游、扶风、灵台、长武、凤翔、岐山及宝鸡，以及永乐、本帐、文书（又称文淑）、蔡家坡、号镇等重要市镇多处。解放军并控制了西兰公路三百余里，和西安宝鸡公路及陇海铁路各一百四十余里，截断了西安与甘肃宁夏青海的联系。在解放军这样猛烈的冲击下，胡匪的西线也正在迅速崩溃。现在西北解放军的强大进攻正方兴未艾，解放大西北这一光荣伟大的斗争，正在全面胜利展开中。
    华东解放军，在胶济西段取得辉煌战绩后，又于二十七日攻克潍县城，全歼守敌四十五师师部、又一个整旅、一个整团又四个保安团等部。我军系于二日至十二日开始向胶济中段昌（乐）潍（县）安（邱）地区展开猛烈的扫荡战，十一天内歼蒋匪二千余名，拔除蒋匪据点七十余处，并先后收复潍县之飞机场与发电厂，及潍县城东南之重要煤矿区与车站坊子镇，蒋匪七、十两日分由东西两端向昌潍增援，均遭我击退。现潍县攻克后，昌安等地之蒋匪更孤悬于我紧密包围中。淮北地方武装则于十日一度攻克泗阳城。
    鄂豫皖方面解放军于十七日在京山东北之宋河、三阳店，全歼蒋匪新十七旅全部二千四百余人，十六日，地方武装于潜江西苏家港歼蒋匪八十二旅二四四团大部，俘五百余人，同日又再度收复鄂西北之均县，各地地方武装亦广泛出击屡有俘获，这一些胜利说明了艰苦创建鄂豫皖解放区的军民正日益发展壮大。
    冀察热辽战场，最近编成并挺进热南之韩梅村将军所部第六师，九日于平泉东获捷，将该地匪伪保警大队自卫队大部歼灭，并歼灭增援之蒋匪八十九师一个营。（新华社陕北二十八日电）
