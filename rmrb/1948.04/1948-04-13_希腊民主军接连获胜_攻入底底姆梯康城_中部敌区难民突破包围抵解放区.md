　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Free Greece Radio broadcast: The Democratic Army recently achieved victories in various locations. On the 4th, Democratic Army infantry, after continuous shelling, captured the city of Dydimoticho on the Greek-Turkish border. From March 23rd to 30th, the Democratic Army in central Macedonia attacked enemy positions in the town of Touba and the village of Bertoto. The Democratic Army's youth detachment entered the city of Sidirokastro (northern Thrace) and distributed Democratic Army manifestos and other propaganda. On March 26th, the Democratic Army attacked an enemy patrol near the city of Florina, frightening the enemy into confusion. Democratic Army soldiers calmly distributed thousands of copies of the Provisional Democratic Government's proclamation to the Greek people in the city. It is reported that refugees who escaped from enemy areas in central Greece on March 20th, under the protection of a guerrilla unit, broke through the enemy encirclement and arrived safely in the liberated area on the 27th. On the way, more than 800 people joined the Democratic Army.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Moscow News: The Soviet naval newspaper Red Fleet Daily published on the 6th an article by military observer Bulanov commenting on the victorious operations of the Greek Democratic Army, stating: The Greek royalist fascist government army launched a spring "major offensive" against the Democratic Army at the end of February. However, the initial stages of the operation showed that the Greek reactionaries had nothing to brag about, and the results of the Democratic Army's active operations in various regions, such as the victorious operations in Epirus, the Peloponnese, Attica (the area where Athens is located), and Thessaly, have created a difficult situation for Athens. The Democratic Army is operating under the slogan of "victory or survival," skillfully using their familiar tactics of maintaining the initiative at all times and choosing favorable opportunities to strike the enemy. Although the Democratic Army's enemies are ten times larger in number and have modern equipment, they have been defeated by the Democratic Army, which has the support of the broad masses of the Greek people. Bulanov pointed out: The Athens government no longer believes that it can deal with the current situation, and is therefore asking the United States and Britain to strengthen emergency military assistance and is negotiating with Turkey to conclude a military alliance. "However, the Greek people will not yield, and the victorious operations of the Democratic Army have inspired and strengthened the Greek people's confidence in achieving final victory."

　　希腊民主军接连获胜
  　攻入底底姆梯康城
  　中部敌区难民突破包围抵解放区
    【新华社陕北九日电】自由希腊电台广播：民主军最近在各地获捷。四日，民主军步兵在连续炮轰之后，攻入希土边界之底底姆梯康城。三月廿三日到三十日，马其顿中部的民主军袭击都巴城和柏托托村的敌军阵地；民主军的青年支队打进了西底洛卡斯特伦城（色雷斯北部），并散发民主军宣言和其他宣传品。三月二十六日，民主军袭击佛洛林纳城附近敌巡逻部队，吓得敌方手忙脚乱，民主军士兵从容在该城散发了整千份临时民主政府的告希腊人民书。据悉，三月二十日从希腊中部敌区逃出来的难民，在一支游击队保护之下，突破敌包围，于二十七日安抵解放区，途中有八百多人参加了民主军。
    【新华社陕北九日电】莫斯科讯：苏联海军机关报红舰队报，六日登载军事观察家布拉诺夫评希腊民主军胜利作战一文称：希腊保皇法西斯政府军于二月底起向民主军发动春季“大攻势”。但是作战初期就显示了希腊反动派并没有什么可以吹嘘的地方，而民主军在各地积极作战的结果，如在爱匹鲁斯、摩里亚半岛、阿提加（即雅典所在的区域）和色萨利的胜利作战，已发生一种使雅典方面显然为难的局面。民主军是在“胜利才能生存”的口号下进行作战的，它巧妙地运用了他们所熟悉的在任何时候都保持主动的战术，而且选择有利时机来打击敌人。虽然民主军的敌人在数量上大十倍，而且有现代化装备，但却被获得希腊广大群众支持的民主军打败了。布拉诺夫指出：雅典政府已不相信自己能对付目前的形势，因此日来正向美英要求再加强紧急的军事援助，并和土耳其进行缔结军事同盟的谈判。“然而，希腊人民是不会屈服的，民主军的胜利作战，鼓舞与加强了希腊人民取得最后胜利的信心。”
