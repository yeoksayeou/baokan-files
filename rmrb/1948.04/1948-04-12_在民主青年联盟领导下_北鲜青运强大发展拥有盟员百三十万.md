　　Under the Leadership of the Democratic Youth League
  　North Korean Youth Movement Develops Strongly, with 1.3 Million Members
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th] Moscow Dispatch: An Bon-chi, a member of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Youth League, recently spoke to a Shao Gong Zhen Li Bao (Young Communist Truth Daily) reporter here, discussing the vigorous development of the North Korean youth movement. He stated that Korea is currently divided into two completely different worlds. North Korea, in the Soviet-occupied zone, has seen tremendous democratic development after the expulsion of the Japanese invaders; South Korea, in the American-occupied zone, continues to see its working people oppressed. Under the leadership of the national hero Kim Il-sung and the People's Autonomous Government, North Korea is advancing along the path of democratic development. Korean patriotic youth, who actively participated in the armed struggle against Japanese fascism during the Anti-Japanese War, are today at the forefront of building a new life. North Korean youth activities are under the leadership of a unified organization—the Democratic Youth League. Currently, the League has 1.3 million members. The situation for South Korean youth is extremely tragic. As early as May 1946, the American occupation authorities disbanded democratic youth groups, and most progressive youth leaders were either shot or imprisoned. In 1946 alone, 310 democratic youths were shot and more than 8,000 were imprisoned. However, the persecution and terror policies of the American authorities cannot shake the fighting will of Korean patriotic youth against the reactionary regime.

　　在民主青年联盟领导下
  　北鲜青运强大发展拥有盟员百三十万
    【新华社陕北十日电】莫斯科讯：北鲜民主青年联盟中委会委员安本志，顷于此间向少共真理报记者纵谈北鲜青年运动蓬勃开展之情况称：朝鲜目前分为两个完全不同的世界，苏占区的北鲜，在驱逐日本侵略者后，民主事业已有巨大发展；美占区的南鲜，劳动人民仍处于被压迫状态中。在民族英雄金贻荪及人民自治政府领导下，北鲜正沿着民主发展的道路前进。抗日期间积极参加反抗日本法西斯武装斗争的朝鲜爱国青年，今天是站在新生活建设者的最前列。北鲜青年活动，是在统一的组织——民主青年联盟领导之下。目前联盟盟员数达一百卅万人。南鲜青年处境却极悲惨，早在一九四六年五月，美占领当局便解散了民主青年团体，大部分进步青年领袖横遭枪毙或被投入监狱，仅一九四六年一年间，被枪毙的民主青年达三百一十人，被投入监狱者八千余人。然而，美国当局的迫害与恐怖政策，并不能摇撼朝鲜爱国青年反对反动政体的战斗意志。
