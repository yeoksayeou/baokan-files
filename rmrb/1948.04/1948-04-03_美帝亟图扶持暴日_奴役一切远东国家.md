Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st — Tokyo dispatch: The US imperialist plot to support the revival of violent Japan in order to invade the people of the Far East has become more concrete through the activities of the Draper industrial delegation in Japan over the past ten days, thus greatly encouraging the revival of Japanese aggressive ambitions. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo on March 25, "The Japanese government, encouraged by the announcement by US Undersecretary of the Army Draper that the US would provide Japan with massive aid, has abandoned its five-year plan and is planning a bolder three-year plan." The so-called five-year plan (also known as the six-year plan) aimed to increase Japan's industrial production level (using 1930-34 as a standard) to 125 percent by the end of 1953. The three-year plan would further increase it to 150 percent." To this end, the US is considering a massive loan plan for Japan. Currently, Tokyo newspapers and foreign journalists in Washington are widely reporting that the US Congress is considering a plan to provide Japan with $580 million in aid annually. The Asahi Shimbun predicts that the total US aid to Japan will reach $700 million or $800 million annually. Kyodo News Agency even revealed that the US is considering providing Japan with $1.8 billion in aid, while the Japanese government is requesting $3 billion in order to implement the Strack revival plan. According to Agence France-Presse, the content of the so-called Strack plan includes maintaining a Japanese merchant fleet of at least four million tons, and retaining more munitions industries and manufacturing plants.

    The US imperialist's extremely vicious plan to "rebuild Japan as the factory of the Far East" (Draper's words) in order to enslave the people of the East has greatly pleased the Japanese reactionaries and made them extremely arrogant. The Japanese Mainichi Shimbun said on March 25: "The United States is especially trying to indirectly help (actually enslave) all Far Eastern countries by directly helping Japan"; "Japan's mission as a stabilizing factor in the Far East has been completely determined." Japanese fascists even congratulated each other: "Fortunately, a political mission has been added to Japan's economic mission: to stop communism." (Agence France-Presse) No wonder the head of the Japanese reactionary government, Ashida, shouted contentedly and shamelessly: "Japan's interests are also America's interests."

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th — According to a TASS dispatch from Sydney, the Sydney Sun newspaper published a Tokyo dispatch revealing the US imperialist's arrogant plan for long-term aggression in the Pacific, stating that the US is establishing a network of naval and air bases north of the equator, centered on Yokosuka, the former Japanese naval base. The United States has selected the port as a long-term occupation base after the conclusion of the peace treaty, with a term tentatively set at twenty years. The report continued: In addition, US imperialism has also decided to establish an air base on Okinawa Island and form a chain of US bases in the North Pacific with Guam and the Hawaiian Islands. According to the report, in this long-term aggression plan, US imperialism has decided to "use Japan as a possible ally."

　　美帝亟图扶持暴日
  　奴役一切远东国家
    【新华社陕北一日电】东京讯：美帝扶持暴日复兴以侵略远东人民之阴谋，经由德莱柏工业代表团在日本十天来的活动而更见具体化，因而大大鼓励了日本侵略野心的复活。据法新社东京三月二十五日电说：“日本政府受了美陆次德莱柏宣告答应给日本大量美援的鼓励后，已将五年计划抛弃，而筹划一较大胆的三年计划。”所谓五年计划（一称六年计划），即从现在至一九五三年底时，将日本工业生产水平（以一九三○到三四年为标准）提高为百分之一百二十五。而三年计划，则更提高至百分之一百五十”。为此目的，美帝正考虑一庞大的对日贷款计划。现东京各报及华盛顿外国记者们正纷传：美国会正在考虑每年援日五亿八千万美元计划。朝日新闻则预料美国援日总数，每年将达七亿或八亿美元。协同通讯社更透露：美正考虑给日本十八亿元援助，而日政府则要求有三十亿元，才能执行斯揣克的复兴计划。而所谓斯揣克计划，据法新社说：其内容包括保持日本商船至少四百万吨，保留较多的军火工业及制造厂。
    美帝竭力“重建日本为远东工厂”（德莱柏语）以奴役东方人民的险毒计划，使日本反动派大为高兴而气焰万丈。日本每日新闻三月二十五日说：“美国特别力图借直接助日以间接帮助（实际是奴役）一切远东国家”；“日本作为远东稳定因素的任务，业已万分确定”。日本法西斯分子更额手称贺：“幸运得很，在日本的经济使命上，又添了一个政治使命：制止共产主义。”（法新社）无怪乎日本反动政府头子芦田要心满意足而厚颜无耻地叫喊：“日本的利益也即美国的利益”。
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据塔斯社悉尼讯：悉尼太阳报东京电讯揭载美帝在太平洋长远侵略的狂妄计划称：美在赤道以北设立海空军基地网，将以日本从前的海军基地的横须贺为中心。美国已选定该港在和约缔结后作为长期占领基地，为期暂定二十年。该报继称：此外，美帝还规定在冲绳岛设空军基地，及以关岛和夏威夷群岛组成美国在北太平洋的基地连锁。据该报透露：美帝在这一长远侵略计划中，已决定将日本“充当可能的盟友”。
