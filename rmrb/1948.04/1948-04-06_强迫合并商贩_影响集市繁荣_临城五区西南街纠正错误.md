　　Forced Merger of Merchants Affects Market Prosperity
　　Southwest Street, Fifth District of Lincheng Corrects Errors
　　[Our News] Leaders of the Fifth District of Lincheng convened a meeting of merchants and cadres at the Haozhuang Market a few days ago to correct the phenomenon of the Southwest Street Production Brigade of the district forcibly merging private merchants and affecting market prosperity in its production organization. When the cadres of the Production Brigade of this street mobilized the masses to participate in mutual aid production in the first month of the lunar year, in order to expand the number of team members and engage in commercial production, they adopted a rigid grouping method. Using the excuse of "not being able to selfishly engage in individual production, but serving the masses," they "mobilized" private grocery stall vendors Wang Sansheng, Li Weike, and others to abandon individual business operations and contribute all their goods to the team for operation. At that time, these three were afraid of being isolated, so they reluctantly agreed. As a result, the private merchants in the village who were affected did not dare to operate either, fearing that they would be merged into the production team. Merchants who were preparing to build houses to expand their business also stopped building, which greatly hindered the development of commerce in the market. After the leaders discovered this problem, they immediately convened a meeting of cadres and merchants to explain our policy on industry and commerce, pointing out that this practice was wrong. The cadres within the brigade also made self-criticisms, admitting that they were undemocratic in organizing production with rigid grouping, which led to errors of infringing on the interests of merchants and affecting private business. After clarifying the issue, in addition to the merchants who were forced to join the team withdrawing and continuing their free business as usual, the production team also carried out a new rectification according to the principle of voluntariness. Now the market of Southwest Street has returned to prosperity, and those who were preparing to build houses for business are also preparing to expand their operations.

　　强迫合并商贩　影响集市繁荣
  　临城五区西南街纠正错误
    【本报消息】临城五区领导上于日前在郝庄市场召开商人及干部会，纠正该区西南街生产大队在组织生产中合并私人商贩、影响集市繁荣的现象。该街生产大队干部在正月发动群众参加互助生产时，为了扩大队员、搞商业生产，便采取了硬编组的方式，以“不能自私搞个人生产、要为群众服务”作借口，“动员”私人杂货摊贩王三生、李为科等三人脱离个人经商，将所有货物入到队内经营，当时这三人怕被孤立便勉强答应了。这样一来，影响的村内私人商贩也不敢经营，都恐怕被生产队给合并去，准备盖房子扩大营业的商人也停止不盖了，这就大大阻碍了该集市上商业的发展。领导上在发现这个问题后，当即召开了个干部及商人会议，说明我们的工商业政策，指出这种作法不对，大队内的干部亦作了检讨，检讨自己在组织生产上硬编组不民主，因而引向侵犯商人利益、影响私人营业的错误。在把问题弄清楚后，除被强迫入队的商贩退出照常继续自由营业外，该生产队亦按自愿原则进行了新的整顿。现西南街的市场已又重新走向了繁荣，准备盖房经商的，也在准备扩大营业了。
