　　【News from this newspaper】The masses in the disaster areas of Shouyang and Xiyang in Taihang, with the help of the local government, have launched a large-scale production and self-salvation campaign. In order to unify leadership, Shouyang established unified spring plowing and disaster relief committees at the county, district, and village levels. Xiyang organized self-salvation societies to investigate the disaster situation, distribute relief grain and funds, help disaster victims produce, and organize self-salvation. In early March, Shouyang distributed 200 shi of relief grain for the first time to poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants who had no food left. Through careful and detailed investigation, the relief grain was distributed to disaster victims who truly needed emergency relief. At the current time when sowing is beginning, in order to help the masses with spring plowing and sowing, another 400 shi of relief grain were distributed for the second time, and at the same time, 400 shi of loan grain and 6.5 million yuan in loans were distributed to solve the masses' difficulties in eating grain, livestock, and seeds during spring plowing. The Shouyang government also sent cadres to the hinterland to purchase seeds for the masses. It has now purchased more than 69 shi and 9 dou of mung bean seeds, 9 shi and 3 of corn, and 4 shi and 5 dou of small red beans, together with more than 95 shi of various seeds left over from last autumn, which can be sown on more than 12,240 mu. Xiyang extracted a loan of 5 million yuan to help the masses buy livestock. The government sent people with the funds to Zanhuang to buy cloth, carried it to Kelan, Shenchi and other areas to sell the cloth, bought livestock back, and loaned it to the masses at the original price plus travel expenses. Compared with the price in the city, each head was 40,000 yuan cheaper, and it did not waste manpower. In terms of health and epidemic prevention, Shouyang organized nine doctors to go to the countryside to treat the masses for the first time, and now it has organized more than 20 people to be scattered in various places to carry out epidemic prevention and treatment, and a part of the relief grain is extracted to solve the problem of medicine for the masses. In organizing production, Xiyang extracted 3.6 million yuan (including 3 million yuan in loans) to specifically purchase medicinal materials (Scutellaria baicalensis, licorice, etc.) from the sixth and eighth districts, and has now received more than 90,000 jin, earning more than 1.8 million yuan, which can be exchanged for 12,000 jin of millet. In other aspects, such as boiling saltpeter, Xiyang only had 16 villages in the eighth district, and from last winter to now, it has boiled 7,474 jin of saltpeter, earning 70,000 jin of millet. Shouyang County originally had 13 saltpeter workshops, and now it has developed to 20. Each workshop can produce 12 jin of saltpeter per day, and can earn 40 jin of millet excluding workshop expenses. In order to organize the masses for transportation, Xiyang negotiated with the military industry department to transport more than 58,400 jin of copper coins, and organized a mass transportation team of thousands of people. According to the location of the inventory, the masses in the disaster-stricken villages were organized by district. Each village was led by the village cadres, with one brigade per district and one squad per village, with ten people in a group. The actions and life on the road were based on the group. In order to help solve the various difficulties of the masses' lives on the road, cadres were sent in advance to connect with the villages along the road to solve the difficulties of food and accommodation, and 400,000 yuan was brought to solve the masses' food and drink problems at each station. In addition, another 2.2 million yuan was specially extracted and loaned to particularly difficult poor laborers for travel expenses. This transportation took 12 days back and forth, earning more than 15 million yuan, which could buy more than 100,000 jin of millet. In the border areas, the disaster is particularly serious due to the enemy's destruction and grain looting. In the fourth district of Shouyang, only the two villages of Wuqingnao and Niuhuangkou were looted by the enemy for grain as many as 18 times in a row. The masses in the border areas, with the assistance of the government, have also generally mobilized to fight the enemy in production and self-salvation. Villages near the railway such as Wuqingnao, Danao, and Kucang, the masses used armed cover to seize more than 4,000 jin of hardware, steel wire, etc. from the enemy at Donghe Station, which could be exchanged for more than 40 shi of millet. The masses in Wuqingnao, Niuhuangkou, Bishi and other villages organized themselves and armed themselves to fight back to their villages. On the one hand, they insisted on fighting the enemy on the spot, and on the other hand, they carried out production. The masses carried luggage to the ground to recover the crops that had not been harvested last year due to enemy looting, and picked black beans and dug frozen wild yams on the ground while repairing the land for spring plowing and sowing. According to incomplete statistics, villages such as Bishi, Tiansi, Zhanghanhe, and Yameng in the fourth district have sown more than 500 mu of flax, peas, wild yams, and spring wheat, and the central Ping in the third district has sown more than 350 mu of peas. Only the villages in the third, fourth, and first districts have sown more than 900 mu in total. In order to better carry out the struggle against the enemy and ensure the completion of spring plowing, the masses were organized separately, with some people participating in the war and supporting the war, and some people carrying out sowing. In the semi-agricultural and semi-industrial areas of the first and second districts of Xiyang, in addition to operating agriculture, the masses in this area also have coal kilns, porcelain kilns, dyeing workshops, and weaving mats, etc., which are workers who rely on industry for their livelihoods. In order to solve the living problems of both farmers and workers at the same time, after consultation between workers and peasants, fair and reasonable wages were stipulated, and workers and peasants were organized to change work and help each other, which has ensured that workers have work to do, industry does not stop, and land is not barren, so that both workers and peasants can tide over the disaster.

  　组织灾胞生产自救
    【本报消息】太行寿阳、昔阳灾区群众在当地政府帮助下，展开了大规模的生产自救运动。为了统一领导，寿阳在县、区、村成立了统一的春耕救灾委员会；昔阳组织了自救社，调查灾情，发放救济粮款，及帮助灾民生产，组织自救等工作。寿阳在三月初第一次发放了救济粮二百石，救济马上没有吃的贫雇、中农，经过了周密细致的调查研究，使救济粮发到真正需要紧急救济的灾民手中。在目前开始下种时期，为帮助群众春耕播种，又发放了第二次救济粮四百石，并同时发放贷粮四百石、贷款六百五十万元，解决群众在春耕中的吃粮、牲口及种籽等困难。寿阳政府并派干部到腹地给群众购买种籽，现已买到绿豆种籽六十九石九斗多、玉茭九石三、小豆四石五斗，连同去秋留下的各种种籽九十五石多，共可下种一万二千二百四十多亩。昔阳抽出贷款五百万元帮助群众买牲口。由政府派人带款赴赞皇买布，驮到可兰、神池一带将布卖了，买回牲口，回来只加路费原价贷给群众，与本城价格比较每头便宜四万元，并且又不浪费民力。在卫生防疫方面，寿阳第一次曾组织医生九人下乡为群众治病，现又组织二十多人分散各地进行防疫及治病，并从救济粮中抽出一部分解决群众吃药问题。在组织生产上，昔阳抽出三百六十万元（内有贷款三百万元）专门收买六、八区的药材（黄芩、甘草等），现已收到九万余斤，共赚洋一百八十余万元，可换小米一万二千斤。其他如熬硝，昔阳仅八区十六个村，去冬到现在就熬硝七千四百七十四斤，已赚了小米七万斤。寿阳全县原有硝坊十三座，现在已发展到二十座，每座每天能出硝十二斤，除硝坊开支外，能赚小米四十斤。昔阳为了组织群众运输，与军工部商妥运输铜元制钱五万八千四百余斤，组织了成千人的群众运输队，根据存货地点，以区为单位组织灾荒村的群众参加。各村有村干部亲自领导，每区一个大队，每村一个分队，十人一小组，路上行动生活均以小组为基础。为了帮助解决群众路上生活的各种困难，并于事先派出干部到沿路村庄拉通关系，解决食宿困难，带去四十万元在各站上解决群众吃喝问题。另外又专门抽出二百二十万元，贷给特别困难的贫雇作路费。这次运输来回共十二天，赚洋一千五百余万元，能买小米十余万斤。在边沿地区，由于敌人的破坏抢粮，灾荒尤其严重。寿阳四区仅五顷垴、牛黄口两村，即曾遭敌连续抢粮十八次之多。边地群众在政府协助之下，也普遍发动起来，在生产自救中与敌人进行斗争。靠近铁路的五顷垴、大垴、库仓等村庄，群众用武装掩护到东河车站向敌人夺回五金器材、钢丝等四千余斤，可换小米四十余石。五顷垴、牛黄口、碧石等村群众组织起来，武装打回本村，一面就地坚持对敌斗争，一面进行生产，群众背着行李上地收回去年因敌抢未收的庄稼，一面在地上拾黑豆刨冻山药，一面修地进行春耕下种。现据不完全统计，四区碧石、天思、张韩河、鸦鸣等村已下种胡麻、豌豆、山药、春麦五百余亩，三区中心坪下种豌豆三百五十余亩。仅就三、四、一区各村共下种九百余亩。并为了更好的展开对敌斗争及保证完成春耕，群众分开组织起来，一部分人参战支差，一部分人进行下种。在昔阳一、二区半农半工的地方，该地群众除经营农业外，还有煤窑、瓷窑及染坊、编席等靠工业为生的工人。为了同时解决农民及工人的生活问题，经过工农双方协商，公平合理规定工资，组织工人和农民的变工互助，已保证工人有工做、工业不停止、土地又不致荒了，使工人农民都能渡过灾荒。
