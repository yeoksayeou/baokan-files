Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st— Tianjin, 6th: According to reports here, 124 people from cultural, educational, industrial, and financial circles in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin and other places have jointly issued a "Statement of Views on Policy Toward Japan," fiercely criticizing US imperialism for aiding the resurgence of Japanese aggressive forces, threatening China's survival, and the Chiang Kai-shek government's traitorous behavior of "sacrificing the entire nation" to act as a "tail" of US imperialism. The statement advocates launching a patriotic movement throughout the country to correct the United States' erroneous policy toward Japan and defend the Chinese nation. The document begins: "The United States, which holds exclusive control, has not complied with the Potsdam Declaration, nor has it respected the wishes of peace-loving people around the world. It is allowing Japan to retain its reactionary potential and maintain the joint rule of its monopoly financial groups and feudal landlords. Even in its rhetoric, it openly boasts that Japan is a storehouse of 'friendship' for the United States in the Far East and an ally in future foreign wars, which is encouraging the arrogance of the remnants of Japanese imperialism. Under the protection and support of the United States, the Japanese imperialists, who had just lost their feathers, now have a new plumage."

The statement continues: People across the country cannot sit idly by and watch the peace conference with Japan sell out the interests of the Chinese nation, repeating the Paris Peace Conference. "We must gather patriotic people from all walks of life across the country and quickly launch a patriotic movement to correct the erroneous US policy toward Japan, stop the remnants of Japanese fascism from raising their heads, and defend the Chinese nation." It puts forward the following propositions:

"1. The current control over Japan and the future peace conference with Japan should focus on thoroughly eliminating Japanese reactionary forces and safeguarding the survival interests of the Chinese nation and world peace. Any policies and measures that condone the revival of Japanese imperialism should be strongly opposed. 2. In accordance with the spirit of wartime agreements that no Allied country shall make peace with the enemy alone, the peace conference with Japan should be convened with the unanimous consent of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. We oppose any proposal to unilaterally convene a peace conference, and we should refuse to participate in a peace conference that excludes the Soviet Union. 3. Respect wartime international agreements, and adhere to the veto power of the four powers in both preparatory meetings and formal meetings. Oppose the so-called two-thirds voting rights. 4. We oppose the Anglo-American bloc's exclusive handling of the peace conference with Japan, but if China and the Soviet Union insist on exercising their veto power, and the United States, under its exclusive control, actively supports Japanese reactionary forces and assists Japan's economic revival in order to create a fait accompli and passively resist China and the Soviet Union, we should bravely expose and resolutely criticize this conspiracy. 5. We oppose Japan's revival entirely because the current Japanese regime is still controlled by a small number of aggressors, not because we oppose the general Japanese people. On the contrary, we are very willing to cooperate with the broad masses of the Japanese people to promote the early realization of Japan's true democratization. 6. The Chinese and American nations have a century-old tradition of friendship, but this cannot lead us to sacrifice our entire nation and blindly act as a tail for others. The United States' policy of actively supporting the remnants of Japanese imperialism is leading the world toward another war. We should unite with the broad masses of the American people to jointly correct the current erroneous policy toward Japan pursued by the US government under the control of Wall Street monopoly financial groups, so that Japan can be effectively controlled in accordance with US wartime agreements and the principle of four-power consensus, and the peace conference can be convened at an early date to complete the peace treaty with Japan."

　　蒋区各界发表对日政策声明
  　抨击美帝扶助日本侵略
    痛斥蒋贼当尾巴出卖民族利益
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】天津六日讯：据此间报载，京、沪、平、津等地文化、教育、实业、金融等各界人士一百二十四人，顷联名发表“对日政策主张”，猛烈抨击美帝扶助日本侵略势力复兴，威胁中国生存，与蒋介石政府“牺牲整个国家民族”作美帝“尾巴”的卖国行为，主张全国展开一个纠正美国对日错误政策、保卫中华民族的爱国运动。该文件首称：“独占管制大权的美国，并未遵守波茨坦宣言、并尊重世界爱好和平人类的愿望，从容日本保留反动潜力，维持其独占财阀与封建地主的联合统治。甚至在言论上，公开夸称日本为美国在远东‘友谊’的储藏所，与未来对外战争的盟友，正鼓舞了日本帝国主义余孽气焰的嚣张。在美国保护与扶植之下，刚才＠羽的日本帝国主义有羽毛重丰之势。”
    声明继称：全国人士不能坐视对日和会出卖中华民族利益，重演巴黎和会；“必须集合全国各界爱国人士，迅速展开一个纠正美国对日错误政策，制止日本法西斯残余抬头，保卫中华民族的爱国运动”。并提出如下主张：
    “一、目前对日管制与将来的对日和会，均应以彻底肃清日本反动势力、保障中华民族生存利益与世界和平为重心，对于任何纵容日本帝国主义复活的政策与措施，均应极力反对。二、依据各盟国不得与敌人单独媾和的战时协定的精神，对日和会应在中美英苏四国一致同意下召开，反对任何片面召集和会的建议，我们应拒绝参加将苏联除外的和会。三、尊重战时国际协定，不论是预备会议或正式会议，都应坚持四强否决权，反对所谓三分之二的表决权。四、英美集团包办对日和会固为我们所反对，但如因中苏坚持否决权，（美国）竟在独揽管制大权之下，积极扶助日本反动势力，协助日本经济复兴，以便造成既成事实，消极抵制中苏两国，针对这种阴谋，尤应勇敢地揭穿，坚决地抨击。五、我们反对日本复兴，完全因为现在日本政权仍掌握在少数侵略派手中，并非反对日本一般人民。反之我们并很愿与日本广大人民合作，促成日本真正民主化早日实现。六、中美两大民族有百年传统友谊，但这却不能使我们拿整个国家民族作牺牲，盲目地给他人作尾巴。美国积极扶助日本帝国主义余孽的政策，实足导引世界走向另一战争。我们应和美国广大人民团结起来，以共同纠正华尔街独占财阀操纵下之美政府现行的错误的对日政策，使依据美国战时协定，与四强一致原则，切实管制日本，并早日召开和会完成对日和约。”
