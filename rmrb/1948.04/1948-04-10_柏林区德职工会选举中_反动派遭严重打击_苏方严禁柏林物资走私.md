　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Berlin dispatch: Since the election campaign for the Central Bureau of the Greater Berlin Area German Trade Union Federation (with 700,000 members) began in mid-March, the reactionary faction within the trade union has been severely hit. The Central Bureau called on all members of the Berlin Trade Union to resolutely fight for the unity of the German workers' movement and for the unity and lasting peace of Germany. Schumacher's so-called "independent trade unions," as trade union scabs, tried to undermine the solidarity of the German trade unions and made support for Germany's participation in the Marshall Plan their main campaign slogan. However, this reactionary policy has been rejected by the broad masses of workers. The metalworkers' union at the Siemens factory in the British-occupied zone of Berlin, which had always been regarded by the reactionaries as its stronghold, recently passed a resolution fully endorsing the leadership line of the German Trade Union Federation Committee. At a workers' rally in Schoeneberg in the American-occupied zone of Berlin, opposition leader Müller was angrily shouted off the stage by the masses because he supported "American aid" and the "Federation of Employers" in his speech. The Central Bureau meeting of the Berlin 20th District Commercial Company Employees Union also overturned the demands of the opposition. According to the Forum, the organ of the German Trade Union Federation, in the election of delegates to the Trade Union Congress, out of the 9,874 delegates elected in 1,607 constituencies, only 1,880 were from the opposition.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Berlin dispatch: On the 1st, newspapers in the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin published various measures taken by the Soviet military authorities to resist the large-scale plundering of industrial equipment and goods from Berlin and their smuggling into the Western-occupied zones. On March 31, Major Ochken, representative of the Berlin Soviet City Defense Commander, instructed the Berlin Municipal Government to immediately take measures to stop such illegal activities by industrialists and speculators that endanger the Berlin economy. Ochken warned that if the City Government continues to be indifferent to activities endangering the Berlin economy, the Soviet City Defense Command will take stronger measures. A few days ago, Lieutenant Colonel Nichamaev, Soviet Assistant City Defense Commander of the Berlin Economic Department, also invited district chiefs and heads of district police stations to discuss measures to prevent the smuggling of industrial equipment and goods from the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin to the western districts of Berlin and the western-occupied zones of Germany. The responsibility for implementing these measures has been handed over to the district chiefs and the district police stations.

　　柏林区德职工会选举中
    反动派遭严重打击
  　苏方严禁柏林物资走私
    【新华社陕北六日电】柏林讯：大柏林区德国职工联合会（会员七十万人）中央局的选举运动，自上月中旬开始后，工会反动派已遭到严重打击。该中央局号召柏林职工会一切会员坚决为德国职工运动的统一，以及为德国的统一与持久和平而斗争。舒马赫的所谓“独立工会”的工贼，则力图破坏德国职工会的团结，并以赞成德国参加马歇尔计划为其主要的竞选口号。但这一反动政策已遭受广大工人群众的唾弃。柏林英占区西门子工厂金属工人工会一向被反动派认为是它的据点，最近该会决议完全赞成德国职工会联合委员会的领导路线。在柏林美占区肖昂堡的工人大会上，反对派领袖米勒因在演说中赞成“美援”及“厂主联合会”，被群众愤怒地吼下讲台。柏林二十区商业公司雇员联合会中央局会议，也推翻了反对派的要求。据德国职工会联合会机关报论坛报报导：在选举出席职工会大会代表时，在一六○七个选区选出的九八七四名代表中，反对派只有一八八○名。
    【新华社陕北七日电】柏林讯：一日柏林苏占区各报刊载苏军当局抵制自柏林大规模劫掠工业装备与货物偷运至西占区的各种措施。上月三十一日，柏林苏方城防司令代表奥其肯少校指令柏林市政府，立即采取中止工业家与投机家危害柏林经济的这种非法活动。奥氏警告称：如果市府对危害柏林经济继续持漠不关心态度，苏联城防司令部将采取更强烈的措施。日前柏林经济司苏联助理城防司令尼查马也夫中校，曾邀请各区长及各区警察局首脑，讨论防止自柏林苏占区私运工业装备及货物至柏林西区与德国西占区的措施。执行该措施之责任，已交给各区长及各区警察局。
