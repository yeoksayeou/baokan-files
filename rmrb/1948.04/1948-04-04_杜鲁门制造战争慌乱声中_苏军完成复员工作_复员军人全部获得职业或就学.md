　　Truman Creates War Panic
  　Soviet Army Completes Demobilization
    Demobilized Soldiers All Obtain Employment or Education
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd] Moscow Dispatch: The demobilization of the Soviet Army has been completed as scheduled. Only young people born in 1926 and 1927 remain in military service. People throughout the Soviet Union have been warmly welcoming the triumphant return of their expeditionary heroes in recent days. Every day, demobilization trains arrive at Moscow Station from various remote defense areas, where representatives of the Soviets, the Party, social organizations, as well as family and friends of the demobilized soldiers, have been standing and waiting early in the morning. Demobilized soldiers receive warm and thoughtful treatment everywhere. Everyone receives a job at least as good as the one they had before joining the army, or enters a school of equivalent level. Local Soviets have allocated special funds to build housing for them, factories have opened various training classes to develop their professional skills, and universities have added preparatory courses to facilitate their enrollment. 99.9% of the demobilized soldiers in Moscow have already found employment or enrolled in schools, and the remaining 0.1% are still resting, after which they will return to their usual work. There is no unemployment. Soviet enterprises, which are worried about labor shortages, have been greatly supplemented by the demobilization of soldiers. The Moscow Automobile Factory alone has added more than 1,000 people.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd] Prague Dispatch: Czech newspapers have all written articles praising the demobilization of the Soviet Army, saying: "While the madness and panic caused by Truman's speech are spreading throughout the United States, Moscow is peacefully preparing to welcome the demobilization of thousands of officers and soldiers, giving them opportunities for work and education." The Red Flag wrote: "Moscow's decision has discredited Truman's warmongering. It is no accident that the US State Department only issued an official comment on the Soviet Army's demobilization two days after remaining silent." 布拉富·里都报 [transliteration of the newspaper name] pointed out: "The Soviet Union is answering the warmongers' clamor with the quiet demobilization of its troops."

　　杜鲁门制造战争慌乱声中
  　苏军完成复员工作
    复员军人全部获得职业或就学
    【新华社陕北二日电】莫斯科讯：苏军复员工作已如期完成。仅一九二六及二七年出生的青年仍留服军役。全苏各地人民连日热烈欢迎其远征壮士之奏凯归来。每天复员列车自各边远防区开进莫斯科车站时，苏维埃、党、社会团体的代表以及复员军人家属亲友，就早日在车站上鹄立等候了。复员军人到处受到殷勤体贴的款待，每一个人都得到至少不低于参军前的工作岗位，或进入程度相当的学校。各地苏维埃为建筑他们的住宅而拨出了特别经费，各工厂为造就他们的职业技能而开设各种训练班，各大学为便利他们入学而增设预料。莫斯科复员军人百分之九十九点九，已就业或入学，其余的百分之零点一还在休息，休息后就可恢复平时工作。没有失业。只愁人少的苏联各企业，已因军人复员而获得有力补充，仅莫斯科汽车厂一处，就补充了一千多人。
    【新华社陕北二日电】布拉格讯：捷克各报均撰论赞扬苏军复员称：“当杜鲁门演说造成的疯狂和慌乱正在全美国蔓延时，莫斯科却和平地准备迎接万千军官与士兵的复员，给他们以工作和教育的机会。”红旗报写道：“莫斯科的决定已使杜鲁门对军备的叫嚣威信扫地，美国国务院在缄默两天之后才对苏军复员发表官方评论，并不是偶然的。”布拉富·里都报指出：“苏联正以其部队的安静复员来回答战争贩子的叫嚣。”
