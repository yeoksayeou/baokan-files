    [Wu'an News] Some villages in the Fourth District have not thoroughly overcome chaotic phenomena and are still infringing upon the interests of middle peasants. For example, in Kangsu Village, six individuals who identify themselves as members of the poor peasant and farm laborer corps—Wu Goudan, Li Lüxiang, Bai Zhangde, Han Xinmin, Han Lude, and Li Side—do not focus on production themselves but force middle peasants to lend them grain, intimidating them by saying, "The 'Outline Land Law' stipulates that you must lend us grain to eat." One day, a middle peasant named Miao San'de was grinding a斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry measure) of wheat when Wu Goudan saw him and immediately said, "The 'Outline' has been in effect for a long time, and you are still grinding flour? I don't even have rice to eat, and you're grinding flour to eat!" With that, he took half of the wheat and left, and San'de didn't dare utter a word. On another occasion, San'de was carrying a斗 of wheat to sell when Goudan saw him again and said, "You're violating the 'Outline' again!" San'de was afraid of trouble, so he bought him several packs of cigarettes to settle the matter. Li Yisheng, an honest poor peasant, returned from a meeting in the district and organized the masses for production. They (Goudan and others) immediately said, "You came back from a meeting in the district without holding a poor peasant and farm laborer meeting, and you're already starting production. How much money did you spend on the cadres? How much flour did you eat from the cadres?" (Meaning, how could you not struggle against the cadres and still engage in production?) In Beitian Village, poor peasants and farm laborers such as Yan Gangbao borrowed grain from more than ten middle peasant households. Their method of borrowing grain was purely through intimidation and coercion, saying to the middle peasants, "The poor peasants and farm laborers have quite a few opinions about you middle peasants these days." The middle peasants replied fearfully, "What opinions? You're in the poor peasant and farm laborer corps, can't you say a few good words for us!" "Saying a few good words is possible, but we don't have any grain to eat now," Yan Gangbao replied to the middle peasants. This frightened the middle peasants, who had no choice but to lend them grain. However, the middle peasants reflected, "It's really unpleasant to lend the grain we worked so hard to produce to those relatives." (Implying they are not respectable people). There was also a Li Baoku who did not engage in production but instead instructed the middle peasants in the village to take turns providing him with meals. In addition, Xie Geng, the head of the poor peasant and farm laborer corps in Yangtun, forced the poor peasants and farm laborers to stand guard for them at night. Zhao Deyi, the head of the poor peasant and farm laborer corps in Yingli, forced the production director (a middle peasant) to give half of his house to the landlord to live in and promoted the idea that soldiers eat and wear government-supplied goods while they are away, so they should not be allocated land. (This is clearly undermining the "Outline Land Law" and shaking the morale of soldiers' families).
    Based on these circumstances, Comrade Hou Guoying, Commissioner of the Taihang Sixth Administrative Office, immediately informed the Wu'an County Government by telephone and instructed them to take effective measures to address the situation immediately:
    (1) It must be recognized that if such infringements upon the interests of middle peasants continue to develop without rectification, it will constitute a fundamental error, confusing the class ranks within the peasantry and hindering the current production movement. According to the instructions of the Central Bureau, there should be no wavering on matters of principle. These chaotic phenomena should be discussed, educated, and exposed among the masses, and they should be rectified immediately. In addition to organizing production for self-liberation, poor peasants and farm laborers facing difficulties in production should be helped with loans and relief grain to carry out production, and the random borrowing or forcing of middle peasants to lend grain should be stopped. Of course, the difficulties faced by middle peasants in production must also be helped to resolve. Among cadres, the one-sided "poor peasant and farm laborer viewpoint" and the tendency to follow the wind should be overcome.
    (2) In areas where work teams have not yet arrived, the activities of fake poor peasant and farm laborer corps (such as in Yangtun Village) should be stopped or disbanded after discussion by the peasant association and the masses, exposing the illegal activities of individual bad elements. Those who undermine the "Outline Land Law" and sabotage production must be punished or sanctioned by the masses. Leaders must not adopt a hands-off, weak, and powerless attitude.
    (3) Other districts and villages should be checked to see if they also have similar situations as above, and attention should also be paid to strict rectification, and all efforts should be turned to production.

    武安四区仍很混乱
    太行六专指示县府迅速纠正
    【武安消息】四区有些村混乱现象仍未彻底克服，还在侵犯中农。如康宿村自称为贫雇团的武狗旦、李吕祥、白张的、韩新民、韩禄的、李四的等六人，自己不好好闹生产，强迫中农借粮，并吓唬中农说：“法大纲”上规定了你得借给我粮食吃。有一天中农苗三的正在磨一斗麦子被武狗旦看见了，即说：“法大纲”早就下来你还磨面，我现在米还没有吃的，你还磨吃面哩！说着就把人家的麦子拿去一半走了，三的不敢哼一声。有一次三的背着一斗麦子又去卖，又被狗旦看见了说：“你又违了‘纲’啦吧！”三的又害怕出事，给他买了几盒纸烟算没事。老实贫农李义生由区开会回来，组织群众生产，他们（狗旦等人）即说，你由区上开会回来也不开个贫雇会，就闹生产。你花了干部多少钱？吃了干部多少面？（意思是怎样不斗争干部又生产哩。）北田村贫雇阎缸保等向中农十余户借粮，他们借粮的办法完全是用吓唬、强迫，对中农说：“这几天贫雇给你们中农提意见可不少呀”，中农害怕的回答：“有啥意见？你们在贫雇团就不能给咱说上几句好话！”“说上几句好话到可以，咱现在就是没有粮食吃。”阎缸保这样的回答了中农，这样引起了中农的害怕，只好将粮食借给他们。但中农反映：“咱勤苦的劳动生产得来的粮食，借给那些妻侄真不痛快。”（指他们不是正派人）还有个李保库也不生产，在村中教中农给他轮流派饭吃。另外阳屯的贫雇团团长谢耕，强迫贫雇到黑夜给他们上站岗。营里贫雇团团长赵德义，强迫把生产主任的房子半串（系中农）让给地主住，并宣传说：战士在外边吃公家穿公家，不能分地，（这显然是破坏“土地法大纲”动摇战士家属）。
    太行六专署专员侯国英同志根据这些情况，当即在电话上告知武安县府，采取有效办法，立即予以处理：
    （一）必须认识这样侵犯中农再发展下去，不加纠正，会犯原则性的错误，混乱了农民内部的阶级阵营，妨碍了目前生产运动的开展。应按照中央局的指示对原则性的问题，不能有丝毫动摇，对这些混乱现象应在群众中讨论教育揭穿，立即纠正。对在生产中困难的贫雇除组织生产自行解放，应将贷款救济粮帮助他们进行生产，停止乱借或强迫中农借粮。当然对中农在生产中的困难也必须帮助解决。在干部中应克服片面的“贫雇观点”及随风倒的态度。（二）凡未经工作组到的地方，成立起来的假贫雇团，（如杨屯等村）应经过农会与群众讨论，揭穿个别坏分子的不法活动，应停止或解散其活动，对个别破坏土地法大纲及破坏生产的分子，必经过群众给以处分或制裁，领导上不能采取袖手旁观，软弱无力的态度。（三）应检查其他区村是否也有类似以上的情况，也应严加注意纠正，全力转向生产。
