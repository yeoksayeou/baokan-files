Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Mass Daily Publishes Short Commentary
Opposing Unserious Attitude in Implementing Policies

[This newspaper's news] The Yihe Town Township work team in Suide, due to unclear viewpoints on class analysis and insufficient collection, analysis, and research of materials, struggled against 48 households, and 36 were wrongly struggled. Some well-to-do middle peasants with only slight exploitation were wrongly classified as rich peasants; some merchants or small vendors who also had a small amount of land, renting it out or employing long-term laborers, were lightly classified as landlords and merchants or rich peasants and merchants simply because their families lived relatively well; individual merchants were severely struggled against because they had engaged in speculative business in the past, or lent some money at interest, to the extent that their commercial property was infringed upon; some who met the standards of new rich peasants were classified as old rich peasants; old landlords and rich peasants whose economies had declined and should have their status changed were not changed, and there were even cases of people being struggled against because of rumors that they had made windfalls in the past. These are all very wrong. After hearing Comrade Xi Zhongxun's resolute instructions to correct "leftist" deviations, the work team still thought it was not a big problem and did not quickly and resolutely correct it, causing bad consequences. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Mass Daily published a short commentary titled "Opposing Unserious Attitude in Implementing Policies," stating:

The phenomenon of the Yihe Town Township work team lacking a serious attitude towards correcting "leftist" deviations and implementing policies, as reported in today's newspaper, is quite widespread, and therefore the lessons of this error should arouse the vigilance of comrades in various places. Why have many comrades failed to resolutely implement the Party's policies in leading land reform work, especially in correcting "leftist" deviations? First, some people say: "It is not good to turn too fast, it should be turned slowly." Facts prove that the slower the turn, the worse it is. All those who emphasize turning slowly are ideologically unwilling to turn or unwilling to turn thoroughly, and continue to distribute things under the pretext of turning slowly, creating "faits accomplis," making errors that were originally easy to remedy very difficult to remedy. Second, some people think that "it doesn't matter if one or two families are wronged." In fact, under this kind of spirit, there will definitely be more than just one or two families that are knowingly wrongly struggled against but not corrected, and even if only one or two families are wrongly struggled against and not corrected, it will inevitably cause many people to distrust the Party's policies because they see this kind of concrete error, and its impact is very significant. Third, some people only change the status of the wrongly struggled peasants, but are unwilling to return things, thinking that this can be regarded as "correction." This is correcting errors in words, but in reality still treating these peasants as targets of attack, and therefore actually continuing to adhere to the error. Fourth, some town and township work comrades only see that some merchants or small vendors live relatively well, and advocate confiscating and distributing the small amount of land they occupy, forcing them to use commercial capital to maintain their livelihoods, thereby actually attacking their commerce. And so on. Under these reasons and pretexts, the correction of "leftist" deviations is dragged out for a long time, turned very slowly, the Party's policies cannot be implemented, the people's morale cannot be fully restored, and production and Party rectification work cannot proceed smoothly, with very bad consequences. The real ideological root cause of these erroneous phenomena is mainly the petty-bourgeois individualistic ideology, which only likes to boast about achievements in its own work, is unwilling to face up to mistakes, or is afraid of trouble, and would rather discount the implementation of policies than bravely correct mistakes. Secondly, it is still following the erroneous thinking of a few people in the poor peasant associations who only want to distribute more things and disregard policies. Now we should oppose this unserious attitude towards implementing the Party's policies. Comrades leading land reform work in various places should learn from the lessons of Yihe Town Township, earnestly examine their own work, and resolutely and quickly correct any "leftist" deviations that have not been seriously corrected. Although land reform has generally stopped during the spring plowing season, correcting mistakes should not stop. The status of all wrongly struggled peasants must be changed without missing a single one, and land, property, and compensation for losses must be returned. Conscientiously publicize and explain the Party's policies to the majority of the people, and through the people's consciousness, correct the erroneous phenomena in the struggle, and achieve the restoration of unity among the people. Only in this way can the Party's policies be implemented in practical work without any discount, and on this basis, the people can be led to carry out the great production movement and the rural democratic movement.

　　陕甘宁群众日报发表短评
  　反对执行政策中的不严肃态度
    【本报消息】绥德义合市镇乡工作组，因分析阶级的观点不明确，和收集材料分析研究不够，斗争了四十八家，即斗错三十六家。把一些只有轻微剥削的富裕中农，错订为富农；一些商人或小商贩兼有少量的土地，出租或雇长工耕种的，只看其家庭的生活比较好一点，就轻率的订为地主兼商人或富农兼商人；个别商人因为过去做过投机生意，或兼放一些帐，而被斗争得很厉害，以至侵犯其商业财产；有些够新富农标准的，订成旧富农；旧地主富农经济已下降，应该改变成份的未予改变，甚至还有因传说某人过去曾发过横财而被斗争的等。这些都是很不对的。工作组于听了习仲勋同志的坚决纠正“左”偏的指示后，仍以为没有多大问题，不迅速坚决纠正，造成恶果。陕甘宁边区群众日报以“反对执行政策中的不严肃态度”为题发表短评称：
    今天本报刊载的义合市镇乡工作团对纠正“左”偏，执行政策缺乏严肃态度的现象，是带有相当普遍性的，因而这种错误的教训，应引起各地同志的警惕。许多同志在领导土改工作中，特别在纠正“左”的偏向中，未能坚决执行党的政策，是有些什么理由呢？第一、有些人说：“转得快了不好，要慢慢转”。事实证明越转的慢了越不好，凡强调慢慢转的都是思想上不愿转或不愿彻底转，在慢慢转的借口下继续分东西，造成“既成事实”，使本来容易补救的错误，变为很难补救了。第二、有些人认为“错一两家不要紧”。实际上在此种精神下，明知斗错而不改正的就决不只一两家，而即使只斗错一两家不去改正，也必然会使不少群众因看到此种具体的错误事实，发生对党的政策的不信任，其关系正是很重大的。第三、有些人只给被斗错的农民改订成份，而不愿给退还东西，认为这样就可算作“纠正”了。这是口头上改正错误，而实际上仍把这些农民当作打击对象，因而实际上是继续坚持错误。第四、有些市镇的工作同志只看到某些商人或小商贩的生活比较充裕，而主张将其占有的少量土地征收分配，迫其必须动用商业资本以维持生活，因而实际上打击了他们的商业。还有其他等等，在这些理由和借口之下，那里的纠正“左”偏，就拖得很长，转得很慢，党的政策不能贯彻，群众情绪不能完全恢复，生产和整党工作不能顺利进行，其恶果是很大的。而产生这些错误现象的真正思想根源，主要还是小资产阶级的个人主义思想，对自己做过的工作，只喜欢夸耀成绩，不愿正视错误，或害怕麻烦，宁可在执行政策上打折扣，而不去勇敢的改正错误。其次，是仍然当了贫农团内少数群众只图多分东西不顾政策的错误思想的尾巴。现在应该反对这种对执行党的政策不严肃的态度。各地领导土改工作同志应该接受义合市镇乡的教训，切实检查自己的工作，凡犯了“左”的偏向而未认真纠正的，应坚决迅速的纠正，现春耕时期土改虽一般停止，但改正错误则不应停止。凡被错斗的农民必须一家都不遗漏的改订成份，退还土地财物和设法补偿其损失。向多数群众认真的宣传解释党的政策，经过群众的自觉，去纠正斗争中的错误现象，达到恢复群众中间的团结。这样才能把党的政策不折不扣的贯彻到实际工作中去，并在这个基础上领导群众开展大生产运动和农村民主运动。
