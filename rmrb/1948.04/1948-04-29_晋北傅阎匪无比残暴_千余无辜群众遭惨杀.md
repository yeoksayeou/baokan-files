Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: (1) Within a year of occupying Zuoyun, the Fu-Yan bandit troops in northern Shanxi massacred over a thousand innocent compatriots in Zuoyun County and the third district of Youyu. According to Guo Changfu, a warden at the bandit Zuoyun detention center, on the night of December 6th last year alone, 56 people were taken from the detention center and all were brutally murdered. When the Yan bandits fled, they threw six grenades into the room where "prisoners" were held, killing over forty people in one room. After the People's Liberation Army recovered Zuoyun City, the masses inside and outside the city requested the democratic government to assist in finding the bodies of their relatives. From March 26th to April 14th, just from the vegetable garden in the northwest corner of the city, the two wells of the "Special Police Group" in North Street, a cave dwelling and a warehouse in the City God Temple, and the moat on the outskirts of the city, 211 bodies of victims were found. The bodies were stripped naked, tied up with ropes, their eyes covered with strips of cloth, their mouths stuffed with cotton, some with their feet chopped off, some with their stomachs cut open, their hearts and livers removed... The democratic government had each victim's body wrapped in new white cloth, purchased coffins for burial, awaited identification by the victims' families, and convened a public memorial service, organizing a people's court to publicly try the Yan-Fu bandits for their crimes of murder. (2) Before fleeing Youyu, the Fu bandits looted extensively. Nineteen head of cattle and donkeys from the Sanyi Winery in East Street, along with the shopkeeper and seven employees, were all taken away, and over 6,000 jin of liquor, brick tea, and grain were looted. Most of the city's total of over 120 head of livestock were taken away by the bandits. Livestock from villagers along the main road from the South Gate of the city to the outer Great Wall's Killing Tiger Pass were almost entirely looted. (3) During the People's Liberation Army's advance into southern Chahar, the Fu bandits not only forcibly conscripted people from various strongholds to repair fortifications under fire, but also drove staff from various agencies, school teachers, and older elementary school students to the front lines to die. Jiao Qingyun, the principal of Yangyuan County Complete Primary School, and teacher Ma Shuzhi were both forced to sacrifice themselves. The Fu bandits in Tianzhen forced the "Red Society" farmers they had "trained" to the front lines to guard the city walls. When the "Red Society" farmers retreated, the Fu bandits strafed them with machine guns, killing and wounding dozens on the spot.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 26th: When a unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army attacked Wei County in southern Chahar on the 24th of last month, they fired "psychological warfare shells" into the city and distributed propaganda such as "Safe Conduct Passes for Ceasefire," which played a very good role in disintegrating the enemy troops. According to Lu Peichun, the captured director of the political department of the Fu bandit's 6th Supplementary Training Division, although many propaganda materials and safe conduct passes for ceasefire were fired by the People's Liberation Army, only about forty copies were delivered to the division headquarters. The soldiers hid the "Safe Conduct Passes for Ceasefire" in preparation for escape. Liu Zhenglin, the battalion commander of the 5th Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the division, said, "At first, I didn't believe in the Safe Conduct Pass for Ceasefire, but after seeing the picture of Luo Lirong (former commander of the Chiang bandit army's 3rd Army, captured in the Qingfengdian Campaign), I believed it." A nurse at the division headquarters said, "I picked up about ten, and they were all snatched up by everyone as soon as I got back." Li Zhan, a soldier in the 1st Battalion of the 1st Regiment, said, "I heard that surrendering your weapons would be treated favorably, and I saw that the Safe Conduct Pass was stamped with Commander Nie's official seal, so I thought it must be reliable, so I didn't fire a single shot and waited on the city to hand over my gun."

    晋北傅阎匪无比残暴
    千余无辜群众遭惨杀
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】（一）傅阎匪军侵占左云一年内，残杀该县及右玉三区无辜同胞达一千余人。据匪左云看守所看守员郭长富供称：去年十二月六日一夜间即从看守所绑出五十六人，全部残杀。阎匪逃窜时，又把六颗手榴弹投入关着“犯人”的房内，有一间房内四十余人全被炸死。解放军收复左云城后，城内外群众即请求民主政府协助寻找自己的亲属的尸体。从三月二十六至四月十四日，仅从城内西北角菜园、北街“特警组”二眼水井内，城隍庙的一孔地窑、一个库所及城郊护城壕，即找出被难者尸体二百十一具。尸体全身衣服被剥光，五花大绑，眼睛蒙着布条子，嘴里塞着棉花，有的脚被砍掉，有的被破了肚子，摘出心肝…………。民主政府当将每个死难者的尸体，用新白布裹身，买棺收殓，等待被难者家属认领，并召开公祭大会，组织人民法庭公审阎傅匪杀人罪犯。（二）右玉傅匪于逃走前，大肆抢掠。东街三义酒坊十九头牛驴，及该店掌柜和七个伙计都被拉走，所有烧酒、砖茶、食粮等六千余斤悉数被劫。该城共有牲畜一百二十多头，大部被匪拉走。从该城南关到外长城杀虎口大道各村庄群众牲畜几全被抢光。（三）此次解放军于进军察南时，傅匪除大量抓捕各据点人民冒炮火抢修工事，并驱使各机关职员、学校教员、及年龄较大的高小学生上火线送死。阳原县完小校长焦庆云、教员马树帜均被迫作了牺牲。天镇傅匪将其平日“组训”的农民“红会”逼上火线，把守城头，当“红会”农民后撤时，傅匪便用机枪向他们扫射，当场死伤数十人。
    【新华社晋察冀二十六日电】晋察冀解放军某部上月二十四日进攻察南蔚县城时，曾对城内傅军放射“攻心弹”，散发“罢战安全证”等宣傅品，对瓦解敌军起了很好作用，据被俘的傅匪补训第六师政治部主任鲁培春说：解放军放射的宣传品和罢战安全证虽很多，但送到师部的总共不过四十余份。士兵都将“罢战安全证”藏起来，准备逃生。该师一团五营营长刘正林说：“我对罢战安全证，最初还不相信，后来看到了罗历戎（前蒋匪军第三军军长清风店战役被俘）的像片就相信了。”该师师部一看护兵说：“我拾了十来张，一回去就被大家抢光了。”一团一营士兵李占说：“我听说放下武器被优待，又看见安全证上面盖着聂司令员的官章，我想一定可靠，所以我一枪也不放，就在城上等着交枪。”
