Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 26th: Pyongyang dispatch: The grand North and South Korean Democratic Parties and People's Organizations Joint Conference ceremoniously opened here on the 19th. It is understood that a total of 600 delegates have arrived, including over 100 representatives from 20 parties and organizations in South Korea. The agenda of the conference is as follows: to discuss the new situation in Korea, unite all national democratic forces, and formulate a concrete political program to fight against the South Korean separatist elections and establish an independent, unified, and democratic new Korea. The participating delegates have a firm belief in crushing the heinous conspiracy of the US military authorities in South Korea to instigate the division of Korea. One of the South Korean representatives, Li Jiguo, a famous Korean linguist, said: This conference symbolizes "the first dawn for the Korean people after liberation from the oppression of Japanese imperialism." The preparatory committee of the joint conference has received over 20,000 congratulatory telegrams and letters from the people of North Korea, warmly supporting the great unity of the entire Korean people.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 26th: Pyongyang dispatch: The South Korean representatives attending the Democratic Parties and Organizations Joint Conference here, after visiting several factories and cultural institutions in North Korea, praised the achievements of North Korea's democratic construction, saying: The free and peaceful life in North Korea is completely different from the police rule and economic chaos in South Korea. North Korean farmers are moving from small thatched cottages into tile-roofed houses, and construction is underway everywhere. The situation in South Korea is the opposite. North Korea's hardware industry is developing rapidly, while South Korea has only six small hardware factories. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the raw materials in these factories, sufficient to maintain six years of production, were all transported to Japan by the US military authorities, so they had to close down. Engineers and experts engaged in the hardware industry were forced to engage in handicrafts because they lost the opportunity to use their skills. A representative of the South Korean Trade Union Federation pointed out: "Under the correct leadership of the North Korean Provisional People's Committee and its leader Kim Il-sung (previously translated as Kim Yi-sun), North Korea's economic construction has made significant achievements." All delegates expressed: North Korea's rapid progress has further strengthened the South Korean people's firm confidence in striving for Korean independence.

    为争取独立统一民主新朝鲜
    南北鲜民主党派会议
    各代表坚信能粉碎美帝分裂阴谋
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】平壤讯：盛况空前的南北鲜民主党派人民团体联席会议，已于十九日在此间隆重开幕。据悉，已到会之代表共六百名，其中有南鲜二十个党派团体的代表百余名。会议议程为：讨论朝鲜新局势，团结全国民主势力。并制定具体政纲，为反对南鲜分裂选举及建立独立统一民主的新朝鲜而斗争。与会代表对粉碎南鲜美军当局策动分裂朝鲜之罪恶阴谋，具有坚定信念。南鲜代表之一——朝鲜著名语言学家李济国说：这次会议象征着“朝鲜人民自日寇压迫下解放后的第一次曙光”。联席会议筹备会已收到北鲜人民二万余份贺电与信件，热烈拥护全鲜人民的大团结。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】平壤讯：南鲜出席此间民主党派团体联席会议各代表，于访问北鲜若干工厂与文化机关后，盛赞北鲜民主建设功绩称：北鲜自由和平的生活，和南鲜的警察统治、经济混乱截然不同。北鲜农民正在由小茅舍搬到瓦房里，到处都在进行着建设工作，南鲜情形则相反，北鲜五金工业迅速发展，南鲜只有六所小五金工厂。日寇投降后，这些工厂中足够维持六年生产的原料，都被美军当局运到日本去了，因此只好关厂。从事于五金工业的工程师与专家，因丧失发挥其技能的机会，而被迫进行手工业生产。南鲜职工联合会代表指出：“在北鲜临时人民委员会及其领袖金日戍（前译为金贻荪）的正确领导下，北鲜经济建设已得到重大成就。各代表咸表示：北鲜的迅速进步，更增强南鲜人民为争取朝鲜独立的坚定信心。
