　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: New York dispatch: A great wave of opposition against Truman's aid to Chiang Kai-shek is rising among the American people. The Democratic Far East Policy Committee has designated April 4th to 11th as "China Week" to launch a nationwide protest against the Truman administration's reactionary policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war. The committee also announced the program for "China Week" in New York, deciding to send propaganda trucks to the docks to call on dockworkers and sailors to resist transporting materials to aid Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, it called on readers of its publication "Far East Spotlight" to carry out the following activities: 1. Publicize the truth about American policy toward China; 2. Urge their congressmen to oppose American interventionist policies in Congress; 3. In this year's election, only support candidates who support a democratic American policy toward China; 4. Write to newspapers and radio stations to oppose interference in China. The committee also published on March 29th a statement by many social celebrities opposing Truman's 570 million aid to Chiang Kai-shek. Famous American reporter Snow said: "In the history of American diplomacy, nothing is more foolish than the current American support for Chiang Kai-shek against the Chinese people's war." Well-known wartime merchant ship captain, black man Moore Zach, said: "It is absurd to think that the United States can force its will on 450 million people. These people are now determined to eliminate their corrupt government and establish their own democracy, and now they are on the road to achieving freedom." Watts, former editor-in-chief of the wartime Information Bureau's China office and writer, said: "Truman's America has become the hope of reactionary and feudal forces everywhere. Continuing to support Chiang Kai-shek will only bring more chaos, pain and destruction to the Chinese people."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: New York dispatch: The "Wallace for President National Committee" announced: The committee launched a month-long peace movement on March 30th. During this movement month, hundreds of Wallace for President local committees, as well as veterans associations, trade unions, women, student groups, ethnic minorities and other groups, will hold demonstrations to oppose Truman's universal military training and conscription law, and defend world peace. And collect declarations and petitions on peace issues and submit them to Congress in order to prevent the passage of conscription and universal military training. The committee also declared that famous representatives from the film, art, radio and theater circles will also participate in this great movement.

　　美国人民掀起“中国周”宣传运动
  　反对杜鲁门援助蒋匪
    号召海员工人抵制装运军火
    【新华社陕北二日电】纽约讯：美国人民正掀起反对杜鲁门援助蒋匪之大浪潮。民主远东政策委员会特定本月四日至十一日为“中国周”，对杜鲁门政府援蒋内战的反动政策，作全国性的抗议。该会并宣布纽约“中国周”的节目，决定派宣传车赴码头宣传，号召码头工人与海员抵制载运物资援蒋。同时号召其刊物“远东要闻”的读者进行下列活动：一、宣传美对华政策的真象，二、敦促他们的议员在国会中反对美国干涉政策；三、在今年大选中，只支持拥护美国对华民主政策的候选人；四、向报纸与无线电台写信反对干涉中国。该会并于三月二十九日发表许多社会名流反对杜鲁门五亿七千万援蒋之声明。美名记者斯诺说：“在美国外交史上，没有任何东西比目前美国支持蒋介石反对中国人民的战争更其愚蠢的事。”战时商船船长著名的黑人穆尔札克说：“认为美国能够把它的意志强迫四亿五千万人民接受，是荒谬的。这些人民现正决心消灭其腐败的政府，建立他们自己的民主，现在他们正走上达到自由之路”。前战时情报局中国办事处总编辑与作家华兹说：“杜鲁门的美国，已成为各地反动和封建势力的希望之寄托。继续支持蒋介石，只会给中国人民带来更多混乱、痛苦和毁灭。”
