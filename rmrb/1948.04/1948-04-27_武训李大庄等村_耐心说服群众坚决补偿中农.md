    Wu Xun, Li Dazhuang and Other Villages
    Patiently Persuading the Masses to Resolutely Compensate Middle Peasants
    [Wu Xun News] In carrying out the spring plowing and large-scale production campaign, Li Dazhuang and Shuangmiao in the Eighth District, gained several experiences in uniting with middle peasants and resolving the production problems of landlords who had been swept out of their homes: 1. Resolutely uniting with middle peasants by compensating them for their losses and abolishing the title of "struggled household" was supported by the masses. Poor peasants said: "Compensating middle peasants for their losses will immediately reconcile middle peasants and poor peasants, and will also eliminate the poor peasants' fear of rising to the level of middle peasants and being struggled against again, and the new middle peasants' fear of struggle." However, they disagreed with compensating the losses of those "struggled" middle peasants who "still do not show signs of yielding" today. At this time, leading cadres must resolutely implement the middle peasant policy and patiently persuade the masses, repeatedly explaining to the masses why he "does not yield," the middle peasant himself has no exploitation, his things are all exchanged for by his own labor and sweat, and is fundamentally different from the landlord, so the middle peasant is naturally dissatisfied with being struggled, because the struggle was wrong in the past. In this way, the poor peasants gradually realized the correctness of the policy of uniting with the middle peasants and resolutely implemented it. 2. In the past, the struggle against the middle peasants was led by the village cadres. Today, when the idea of compensating for losses is proposed, it is difficult for the village cadres to get their minds straight, they are afraid that the struggled middle peasants will unite and counterattack them. The director of the Wuwei Committee of Li Dazhuang said: "Our village did not struggle against the middle peasants." He wanted to use "did not struggle against the middle peasants" to achieve the purpose of not compensating the middle peasants for their losses. After the leadership explained and the class division was carried out at the poor peasant meeting, it was found that many mistakes had been made in the past, so the village cadres' thinking was also patiently explained. In this way, the middle peasants will be happy and will never unite to launch a counterattack. 3. Filling in some land for the landlords who have been swept out of their homes and have no way to maintain their lives, it is explained that this is for the purpose of developing production, so that the landlords will no longer live an exploitative parasitic life, so as not to go down the wrong path, which is not conducive to the peasants, and it is definitely not a landlord's position. The poor peasants of Shuangmiao said: "If we don't give the landlords some land, in the autumn they will steal the crops of us poor people again! Begging for food is also exploiting us! It's better to give him some land!" (Ma Jinghan)

    武训李大庄等村
    耐心说服群众坚决补偿中农
    【武训消息】在开展春耕大生产中，八区李大庄、双庙，进行了团结中农与解决扫地出门地主的生产问题，得到几点体验：一、对弥补中农损失，取消“被斗户”名称，坚决团结中农，得到群众拥护。贫农说：“补偿中农损失，马上就能使中农与贫农和好起来，同时也把贫农怕上升到中农再被斗的思想，和新升中农害怕斗争的思想一下去掉了。”可是对今天“仍表现不低头”的被斗中农不同意补偿他们的损失。这时候，领导干部要坚决贯彻中农政策，又要耐心说服群众，再三向群众说明他为什么“不低头”，中农本身没有剥削，他的东西都是自己劳动血汗换来的，和地主根本不一样，所以中农被斗自然不满，这是因为过去斗错了。这样使贫农才逐渐认识了团结中农政策的正确，坚决执行。二、过去斗争中农是村干领导的，今天一提出弥补损失，村干很难打通思想，他们怕被斗中农联合起来向他们反攻。李大庄武委会主任说：“俺村没斗着中农。”他想用“没斗着中农”达到不弥补中农损失的目的。经过领导上一讲，和贫农会上划阶级，过去划错了许多，所以对村干这个思想也作了耐心的解释，这样作了中农光会高兴，绝不会联合起来打反攻。三、扫地出门没法维持生活的地主填补一些土地，说明这是为了发展生产，使地主不再过剥削的寄生生活，免得他走坏路，对农民不利，决不是地主立场。双庙贫农说：“不给地主点地，到秋里麦里他又该偷咱穷人的庄稼啦！要饭也是剥削咱！还不如分给他点地哩！”（马景汉）
