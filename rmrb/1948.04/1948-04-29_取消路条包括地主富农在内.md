    Canceling Travel Permits Includes Landlords and Rich Peasants
    To the Editors:
    1.  When the people of the Second District of Lucheng saw in the newspaper that the travel permit system would be abolished in the future, they were very happy. However, the peasants asked if landlords and rich peasants would also be allowed to move around without travel permits. If they are not issued travel permits, how will they be managed? What if they run away?
    2.  After the report on April 10th was issued, cadres and the masses saw that the difficulties of households suffering from the spring famine were being resolved, and that attention was being paid to solving the difficulties of landlords and rich peasants who could not make a living or had little land left, so that the landlords could survive. The masses said that landlords and rich peasants used to exploit the peasants, and now they should work to repay their debts. Can a portion of the wages earned by peasants helping each other and landlords and rich peasants by spinning cotton be deducted from their wages?
        (Wang Yuzhu, District Committee of the Second District of Lucheng)

    Comrade Wang Yuzhu:
    Canceling travel permits includes landlords and rich peasants. The Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee clearly stated: All special controls on landlords, such as special armbands, signs, asking for leave to go out, reporting visitors, and other symbols, should be unconditionally and immediately abolished. If you have not yet distributed the same share of land and property to landlords in accordance with the Land Law Outline, and they still lack the means of production and livelihood, and cannot carry out production well, you should quickly resolve this appropriately and provide them with the conditions for production. If this has already been done, the landlords can concentrate on production and will not run away again. The masses' concern that landlords will run away if travel permits are abolished is unnecessary. In addition, you asked whether a portion of the wages of landlords and rich peasants in mutual aid groups can be deducted. It should be affirmed that this is not allowed. Landlords participating in mutual aid or working for others must receive equal pay for equal work. The Central Bureau's instructions to the Taiyue District Party Committee have already stated: "It should be strictly forbidden to use landlords and rich peasants for unpaid labor, and all labor service teams, repentance institutes, and detention centers in the villages should be immediately disbanded. This is a violation of government laws and a violation of the democratic rights of the people." You should resolutely implement this policy, and persuade the masses not to use the excuse that the masses' thinking is not clear to justify not correcting past mistakes and following the temporary radical emotions of the masses.

### 取消路条包括地主富农在内

    取消路条包括地主富农在内编辑同志：
    一、潞城二区老百姓看到报纸上发表今后要取消路条制，都很高兴，但农民问地主富农是不是也不开路条让他来回行动，如不开路条叫怎管理？他要跑走怎办呢？
    二、四月十日报下来后，干部群众看到解决春荒户困难，并叫注意解决无法生活、或留地少的地主富农的困难，让地主活下去。群众说地主富农过去剥削农民，现在他应该劳动还债，农民和地主互助，及和地主富农纺花赚的工资是否能扣他一部分？      （潞城二区区委王玉珠）王玉珠同志：
    取消路条包括地主富农在内。中央局给太岳区党委指示中明确指出：对地主特殊管制，如特殊臂章、牌号、出门请假、来客报告及其他标帜等，均应一律立即无条件的取消。你处如尚未按照土地法大纲给地主分同样一份土地和财产，他们至今仍缺乏生产资料和生活资料，不能很好的进行生产，应该赶快适当解决，给他们以生产条件。如已这样作了，地主即可安心生产，就不会再逃跑，群众说取消路条怕地主逃跑是不必要的。另外你问和地主富农在互助组是否可扣他一部分工资？应该肯定不能扣，地主参加互助或给人做活，必须同工同酬。中央局给太岳区党委的指示已经说明：“应一律禁止使用地主富农作无偿劳动，应一律立即解散所有村中的劳役队、反省院与拘留所，这是违反政府法令与违犯人民民主权利的。”你们应该坚决执行这一政策，说服群众不能借口群众思想打不通，而不纠正过去的错误，跟群众一时的偏激情绪后面跑。
