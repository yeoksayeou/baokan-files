Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 8th. The militia guerrilla forces in the Dabie Mountains are mobile and flexible, actively harassing the enemy. On December 1st of last year, Chiang Kai-shek's 48th Division advanced from Jinzhai County (Li Huang) to Shangcheng. The journey of more than one hundred li should have taken two days, but it took nine. On the first day, as the vanguard of the bandit army passed the Teapots Ridge (northwest of Jinzhai), gunshots rang out from the mountain. The bandit army hurriedly turned back and set up artillery, bombarding the mountaintop for three hours before dividing into three routes and cautiously advancing while firing. The militia on the mountain found it very amusing. Peng Dayuan happily said, "This is a good deal. We only fired three shots, but the enemy fired tens of thousands of bullets, not counting the artillery shells." A few hours later, the main force of the bandit army passed, followed by a few scattered bandit soldiers. Militia member Zhang Liyou and three team members rushed to the road, fired two shots, and shouted, "Hand over your guns!" Two bandit soldiers panicked and dropped their guns and ran. The Chiang Kai-shek army thought that the People's Liberation Army had cut them off, and they became even more panicked. The front fired at the back, and the back fired at the front, but they saw no one after firing for a while. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek commander divided the troops into two groups, attacking Teapots Ridge and Huopao Ridge separately. They had just climbed halfway up the mountain when the militia fired two shots, a Chiang Kai-shek bandit fell to the ground, and the rest ran back. The militia ate on the mountain, carried the newly captured Czech-style rifles down the mountain. At this time, the grain transport team captured by the bandits was marching on the road, the militia shouted: "Put down the rice!" The escorting Chiang Kai-shek bandits panicked and ran back. More than two thousand catties of rice became the spoils of the militia. As a result of this harassment, Chiang Kai-shek's 48th Division only traveled five li in a day, and still camped beside the road that night.

　　大别山民兵机灵袭敌
  　常弄得蒋匪乱放空枪
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线八日电】大别山上的民兵游击队机动灵活，积极袭扰敌人。去年十二月一日，蒋匪四十八师从金寨县（立煌）向商城进犯，一百多里路程，本来两天可达，却走了九天。第一天匪军的先头部队刚走过茶棚岭（金寨西北），山头上响起了枪声，匪军大队，连忙回转头去摆起大炮。向山顶上乱轰一阵，一直打了三个钟头，然后才分成三路，提心吊胆的一边打枪一边走；民兵在山头上看见十分好笑，彭大远高兴的说：“这个买卖做得好，咱们只打了三枪，敌人却打了好几万发子弹，炮弹还不算”。几个钟头后，匪军的大队人马过去了，后面还有零星的少数匪军，民兵张立友和三个队员冲到大路上，连打两枪，大喊“缴枪”，两个匪军惊慌的丢下枪就跑，蒋匪军以为是解放军把他们从中截断了，更加惊慌起来，前面的向后面打，后面的向前打，打了一阵却不见人。这时蒋匪指挥官把队伍分成两路，分别向茶棚岭及火炮岭进攻，刚刚爬到半山腰，民兵打了两枪，一个蒋匪倒地，剩下的都跑了回去。民兵在山头上吃了饭，背起刚缴来的捷克式枪走下山来，这时匪军抓来的运粮队，正在大道上行进，民兵大喊：“把米放下”，押运的蒋匪慌做一团，连忙往回跑，两千多斤大米，便成了民兵的胜利品。这样袭扰的结果，使蒋匪四十八师一天只走了五里路，当晚还是在大道旁边露宿。
