Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 17th: According to TASS, Pyongyang, April 12th: The Second Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea has concluded victoriously. The congress warmly discussed the report made by Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea, to the Central Committee of the Workers' Party. In his closing remarks, Kim Il-sung said, "The main task of our party is to strive for the simultaneous withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in Korea and to allow the Korean people to decide the issue of establishing a national democratic government themselves, as suggested by the Soviet Union." Kim called on the Workers' Party to lead the people in the struggle against the divisive election conspiracy orchestrated by the U.S. military authorities in South Korea. Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the party, stated in a speech to the 990 delegates attending the congress, pointing out the current situation in Korea, that North Korea has laid a solid foundation for the establishment of an independent and democratic Korea. Although the reactionary forces in South Korea are still running rampant, the democratic forces opposing the reactionary policies are growing stronger day by day. He firmly stated, "The democratic forces will win victory." Amidst cheers, the congress unanimously passed a telegram to Soviet Marshal Stalin, expressing gratitude to the Soviet people for helping the Korean people liberate themselves from Japanese enslavement and for assisting in Korea's economic construction.

　　朝鲜劳工党主席坚称
  　民主力量必将胜利
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社平壤十二日讯：朝鲜劳工党第二届代表大会已胜利闭幕。大会曾热烈讨论了北鲜临时人民委员会主席金贻荪在劳工党中央委员会上所作的报告。金贻荪致闭幕词时说：“我党主要的任务，就是争取外国驻鲜军队同时撤退，让朝鲜人民自己决定建立全国民主政府的问题，如苏联建议那样。”金氏号召劳工党领导人民为反对南鲜美军当局所策动的分裂选举阴谋而斗争。该党中央委员会主席金托本日前向九九○名出席大会代表演说时，指出朝鲜目前形势称：北鲜已奠定了建立独立民主朝鲜的巩固基础。南鲜反动派虽仍在横行霸道，但是反对反动政策的民主力量已一天天状大。他坚称：“民主力量将赢得胜利。”在欢呼声中，大会一致通过致电苏联元帅斯大林，向帮助朝鲜人民从日寇奴役下解放出来、并扶助朝鲜经济建设的苏联人民致谢。
