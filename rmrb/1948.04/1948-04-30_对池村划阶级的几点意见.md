    Some Opinions on Classifying Classes in Chi Village

    Chairman Mao said: The proportion of landlords and rich peasants in the rural population is generally 8% of the households. However, this is not the case in every village; some have more and some have less. Chi Village in Yuanshi County is a newly liberated area, and it is possible that landlords and rich peasants account for 9.5% of the village. However, judging from the examples cited in this article, the classification results are probably still problematic. For example, Shi Qunshan does not work now because he is old, over sixty years old, and his body was injured by a cart. Although he hires long-term laborers, if his life is difficult, worse than that of an average middle peasant, and has been so for more than three consecutive years, he should not be considered a landlord or rich peasant. The classification of Shi Erchou's family as rich peasants is also not explained. I don't know if it is because he has hired labor. If he only has one hired laborer, and Shi Erchou's labor and the hired laborer's labor are equal, then the exploitation income does not exceed one-quarter of the total income, and he should be considered a prosperous middle peasant. Only if he hires a long-term laborer and also hires short-term laborers can he be classified as a rich peasant. If the family population is more than twenty people, and the number of able-bodied laborers in the family (men aged 18 to 50) participating in major agricultural labor is less than one-third, can he be considered a landlord or managing landlord. If this is indeed the case, then it is not correct to classify Shi Erchou himself as a middle peasant; because judging from the situation described, although Shi Erchou labors in the family, he is still in a master position, and consumes together with other people in the family, then he alone should be considered a rich peasant. Only those who are in a significantly exploited position in the family can be considered exploited. Also, not all rich peasants who started from labor are considered new-style rich peasants. New-style rich peasants are those who rent or occupy more and better land, own livestock, farm tools, and other means of production, participate in agricultural labor themselves, but often rely on capitalist methods to exploit hired labor, or other capitalist exploitation income, as the main or important part of their livelihood. The treatment of new-style rich peasants is also not the same as that of prosperous middle peasants. The surplus land of the new-style rich peasants in old China that exceeds the average owned by general middle peasants can be confiscated and distributed by the peasants' association, but the surplus property should still be protected. For those who became new-style rich peasants after the establishment of the local democratic government, due to various policies implemented by the democratic government to support farmers, and obtained land and other legitimate benefits through diligence and thrift, before the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, they should be treated as prosperous middle peasants, and their surplus land should not be extracted and distributed without their consent, and their surplus property should be protected. It is also inappropriate to classify Shi Luzi as a "vagrant element." It is too vague to say that he has been "down and out for more than ten years and does not engage in proper business." According to the central documents on class classification: after a landlord goes bankrupt (that is, loses all or most of his land), if he does not engage in proper business, and relies on his past savings, relatives and friends' assistance, or various improper methods to make a living, under the conditions that his labor situation and other living conditions are the same as those of a landlord, he should be regarded as a landlord. If his labor situation and other living conditions are different from those of a landlord, he can be considered a vagrant (according to regulations, there is no such component as "vagrant element"). However, "improper methods" need to be clarified as indeed improper, such as theft, robbery, fraud, extortion, begging, selling contraband, gambling, prostitution, opening opium dens, casinos, brothels, etc.; and these methods must be used as the main livelihood for three consecutive years to be considered a vagrant. ... Since the standards for class classification have not yet been mastered, there are likely to be many errors in the components classified in Chi Village this time; a more cautious approach is needed when classifying again, and if there are errors, they must be corrected.

    In addition, the class classification in Chi Village this time was still dominated by the simple emotion of "finding the enemy" until the end; "forming a mass movement to speak out grievances and struggle"; this may produce an uncalm and unscientific attitude; the staff is also easy to get carried away and become the tail of the masses. It is permissible to speak out grievances in the class classification process, however, it is inappropriate to turn the class classification process into a movement to speak out grievances and struggle. Therefore, many classifications were wrong, and this is one of the main reasons. It is good to hold meetings in time to discuss and correct errors during the classification process. However, it is not good to let off lightly those comrades who have made mistakes; it may still make everyone's work attitude and attitude towards policies not serious enough. We suggest that those who have made mistakes must be given strict criticism; whoever made the mistake must be responsible for correcting it. - Of course, it should not form a situation of monopolizing everything and commandism; the correct policies should be handed over to the masses, and the correction should be done publicly and on a mass scale.

### 对池村划阶级的几点意见

    对池村划阶级的几点意见
    毛主席说：地主富农在乡村人口中所占的比例，一般是户数的百分之八。不过并不是每个村子都是这样，有多的也有少的。元氏池村是新区，地富占全村百分之九·五是可能的。不过，就这篇文章中所举的几个例子看，划的结果恐怕还是有问题的。如师群山，现在不劳动是因为年纪大了，已六十多岁了，而且身体叫大车压坏了。他虽然雇长工，如果生活困难，不及一般中农，并连续三年以上，还是不应认为地主或富农的。师二丑家划为富农，也未说明理由，不知道是不是因为有雇工；如果只有一个雇工，师二丑和这个雇工劳动力相等，则剥削收入是不超过总收入的四分之一的，应认为富裕中农。如果雇个长工还雇有短工，才能成立富农成份。如果家庭人口在二十人以上，家中全劳力（十八岁至五十岁的男子），参加主要农业劳动的人数不及三分之一，才能认为是地主或经营地主。假若真是这样成立了经营地主成份，则师二丑本人划成中农又不对了；因为就所说的情形看，师二丑在家庭中虽然劳动，可是也还处于主人地位，和家里别的人共同消费，那他一个人应认为富农。只有在家庭中处于显著的被剥削地位的人，才能认为被剥削者。还有并不是所有劳动起家的富农，都算新式富农。新式富农是租入或占有较多较好的土地，占有耕畜、农具及其他生产资料，自己参加农业劳动，但经常依靠以资本主义方法剥削雇工，或其他资本主义剥削的收入，作为其生活来源的主要或重要部分的人们。对于新式富农的待遇，也不是一律和富裕中农一样。旧中国的新式富农，他的超过一般中农平均所有的多余土地可由农会征收分配，但多余财产仍应受保护。对于当地民主政权成立后，因民主政府所实行的各种扶助农民的政策而得到土地及其他正当利益勤俭致富，在土地法大纲颁布前已成为新式富农的，才应按富裕中农待遇，其多余土地不得本人同意不应抽出分配，多余财产应予保护。把师禄子划成“流氓分子”，也是不妥的。只说他“破落十余年不务正业”太笼统；按中央划阶级文件规定：地主破产（即丧失全部或大部土地）以后，不从事正当职业，依靠其过去积蓄、亲友接济或各种不正当方法为生，在其劳动状况和其他生活状况同于地主的条件下，以地主论。如果劳动状况及其他生活状况不同于地主，可认为游民（按规定，没有“流氓分子”这个成份）。不过，“不正当方法”，需要弄清楚确是不正当的，如偷盗、抢劫、欺骗、敲诈、乞食、贩卖违禁品、赌博、卖淫、开烟馆、赌场、妓院等；而且要以这些方法作为主要生活连续三年的才能认为游民。……既然对划阶级的标准还没掌握好，池村这次划出的成份，很可能还有不少错误的；再次划时需要更加慎重，如有错误，一定要订正。
    另外，池村这次划阶级直到最后还是为单纯的“找敌人”的情绪支配着；“形成群众诉苦斗争运动”；这可能产生不冷静、不科学的态度；工作人员也容易脑子一热就当了群众的尾巴。在划阶级中诉苦是应该允许的，不过，把划阶级的过程弄成诉苦斗争运动是不合适的。所以划错了不少，这就是主要原因之一。划的过程中，及时开会讨论纠正，这是很好的。不过，对于犯了错误的工作同志轻轻放过是不好的，仍可能使大家的工作态度、对政策的态度不够严肃。我们建议：对于犯了错误的，必须给以严格的批评；谁犯了错误，谁就必须负责纠正。——自然也不能又形成包办代替、命令主义；应该把正确的政策交给群众，作群众性的公开的纠正。
