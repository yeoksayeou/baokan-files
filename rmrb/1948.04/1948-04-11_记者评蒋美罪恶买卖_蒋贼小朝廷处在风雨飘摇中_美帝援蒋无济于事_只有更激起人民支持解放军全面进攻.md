Xinhua News Agency reporter's commentary on the criminal deal between Jiang and the US

Traitor Jiang's petty court is in peril

US aid to Jiang is of no avail

It will only further arouse the people to support the People's Liberation Army's full-scale offensive

[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th] Regarding the US Senate and House of Representatives passing the "Comprehensive Foreign Aid Bill" on March 30th, continuing to supply the Jiang bandit government with $463 million in so-called "economic and military aid," a Xinhua News Agency reporter commented: Since Japan's surrender, in order to turn China into a US colony, US imperialism's investment in Jiang's counter-revolutionary civil war has reached $4,640,049,000. But what it has gained is only the great revolutionary offensive of the People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country, and the rapid collapse of Jiang's petty court. This new aid of $463 million will certainly not be able to save the inevitable demise of Jiang and US imperialism's rule in China. The Xinhua News Agency reporter said: Since February this year, when US imperialism formally put forward the new "aid to Jiang" "plan," a small group of war-mongers in the US and Jiang Jieshi's bandit gang have been clamoring and bargaining, making a complete spectacle of themselves. Now this dirty and bloody deal has been formally made public as a number. The so-called "bill" says "to use $363 million as economic aid to 'China' (referring to Jiang's petty court), and another $100 million to be given to 'China' (Jiang's petty court) to be used for military purposes at its own discretion." This is an extremely hypocritical deception. In fact, all the aid is for military purposes, and even before this so-called "bill" was formally passed, US military supplies had long been continuously rushed to Jiang. However, it is the first time that military aid to Jiang has been formally passed through the form of the US Congress. This shows that US imperialism has officially declared war on the Chinese people. In the past, US imperialism's tricks such as Marshall's "mediation," pretending to be "neutral" between Jiang and the Communists, and "non-interference in China's internal affairs" were nothing but sinister conspiracies and deceptions, reflecting the timidity of this paper tiger. Now, seeing that Jiang's complete collapse is imminent, the dagger is revealed when the game is up, and it is forced to come out and completely expose its full狰狞 face. As for its still playing the tune of saying that most of it is "economic aid," and putting on a coquettish pose, it only reflects that this paper tiger is still timid. The Xinhua News Agency reporter pointed out that all US aid can only have four words for the tottering Jiang family petty court: of no avail. The Jiang bandit government's public monetary expenditure budget for the first half of 1948 is listed as over 96 trillion Jiang coins. Judging from the speed of price increases in the Jiang-controlled areas over the years and the relationship between financial expenditures for the counter-revolutionary civil war, the actual expenditure must be at least five times more than the budget. Then, the Jiang bandit government's actual monetary expenditure this year must be more than 10,000 trillion Jiang coins, with a monthly expenditure of 83 trillion yuan and a daily expenditure of 3 trillion yuan. According to the Jiang government's official exchange rate in early February, the daily expenditure is equivalent to 20 million US dollars. This aid of 463 million US dollars, calculated on an annual basis, averages 38.58 million US dollars per month, which is not even enough for Jiang bandit to spend for two days. Even if 463 million US dollars are shipped here at once, it would only be enough for Jiang bandit's court to spend for 23 days. So the conclusion can only be one: of no avail. And even if more is shipped, it will still be of no avail. US imperialists should know this very well. The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, when passing this aid, had to make such a wail: "The United States cannot guarantee the fate of China (referring to Jiang's petty court)." In this helplessness, US imperialism scolded Jiang as his master, which is the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee's "severe condemnation" of the Jiang bandit government in the so-called "aid to China report," scolding him for "corruption, incompetence, and bureaucratic habits have become more serious during the chaotic period of inflation, and the stupidity and incompetence in military leadership, and the corruption of army generals, have greatly reduced the morale of the army." But its reactionary policy of enslaving China can only rely on this "stupid and incompetent" lackey to implement it, so US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg had to "repeatedly reach out and wipe the sweat from his forehead," "laboriously read out his statement," and "withdraw" the "report." On the other hand, the big and small officials of the Nanjing petty court "expressed pessimism," "special regret," and "great panic" when they saw this so-called "aid to China report." Regarding this embarrassing and extremely bored mood of both the US and Jiang, the Xinhua News Agency reporter said: This is another ugly performance of Jiang and the US in this bloody deal. There is no doubt that in this criminal deal, Jiang Jieshi's bandit gang has further dedicated China's sovereignty to US imperialism. Jiang's Central News Agency had long admitted without being beaten that the US aid to Jiang plan would include the establishment of a "Sino-US agreement," and Jiang bandit must fulfill various terms. Under the supervision of his American masters in all aspects, when Bei Zuyi was running around and wailing in the US for this aid, the Tianjin and Shanghai newspapers revealed that Jiang and the US were conducting new negotiations on "developing" South China and Taiwan. The Xinhua News Agency reporter concluded: US imperialism's new aid to Jiang bill and new actions to enslave China will inevitably be shattered by the Chinese people. The new deal between the US and Jiang to destroy China is further arousing the courage of the Chinese people and all righteous people to fight for independence and freedom. The Chinese people will more actively support the People's Liberation Army's full-scale offensive, and the People's Liberation Army will continue to heroically seize the weapons given by the invaders to the traitors and fight against the enemy as the most powerful and effective answer to US imperialism's declaration of war on the Chinese people.

　　新华社记者评蒋美罪恶买卖
  　蒋贼小朝廷处在风雨飘摇中
  　美帝援蒋无济于事
  　只有更激起人民支持解放军全面进攻
    【新华社陕北九日电】对于三月三十日美国参众两院通过“全盘援外法案”继续供给蒋贼政府以四亿六千三百万美元之所谓“经济与军事援助”一事，新华社记者评论称：日本投降以后，美帝国主义为将中国变成美国的殖民地，对于蒋贼反革命内战的投资，已达四十六亿四千零四十九万美元。但它所得到的结果，只是人民解放军与全国人民的伟大革命进攻，和蒋贼小朝廷的迅速走上崩溃。此次四亿六千三百万美元的新援助，当然更不能挽回蒋贼以及美帝国主义在华统治的必然覆灭。新华社记者称：从今年二月，美帝国主义正式提出援蒋新“方案”以来，美国的一小群战争贩子，和蒋介石匪帮们便吵吵囔囔，讨价还价，丑态百出，现在这场肮脏的血腥交易，算是形式上公开一个数目字了。该所谓“法案”说“以三亿六千三百万美元作为对‘中国’（按指蒋贼小朝廷）之经济援助，另一亿美元赠予‘中国’（蒋贼小朝廷）由其自择作为军事用途”。这是一个极端虚伪的欺骗。事实上，全部的援助都是军事用途，而且在这个所谓“法案”形式上通过以前，美国的军事物资已经老早不断地在赶运给蒋贼了。但是经过美国国会的形式，正式通过军事援蒋，这还是第一次。这是表示美帝国主义已正式向中国人民宣战。美帝国主义过去玩弄什么马歇尔“调解”，伪装在蒋共之间“中立”及“不干涉中国内政”等都不过是险恶的阴谋与欺骗，以反映这个纸老虎的胆怯。现在眼看蒋贼的完全塌台，已迫在眉睫，图穷匕首见，就迫得它要出来把自己的全副狰狞面目完全公开。至于其还要玩弄一番说大都是“经济援助”的花腔，来一套妞妮作态，那只是反映这只纸老虎仍然胆怯。新华社记者指出，一切美援对于摇摇欲坠的蒋家小朝廷，其结果只能是四个字：无济于事。蒋贼政府一九四八年上半年的公开货币支出预算，列为蒋币九十六万余亿元，从历年蒋管区物价上涨的速度，与反革命内战财政支出的关系来看，实支至少要超过岁出预算的五倍。那末今年蒋贼政府的货币实支至少当在蒋币一千万亿元以上，每月支出八十三万亿元，每天支出三万亿元。按二月上旬蒋政府牌价折合每天支出美金二千万元，这项四亿六千三百万美元的援助，以一年计算每月平均是三千八百五十八万美元，尚不足蒋贼两天的开支，就算四亿六千三百万美元一次运来了吧，也只够蒋贼朝廷花销廿三天，所以结论只能是一个：无济于事。而且即使运来多些也仍然无济于事。关于这点，美帝国主义者应当是很知道的。美国参院外委会在通过此项援助时，也不得不作这样的哀鸣：“美国不能保证中国（按指蒋贼小朝廷）之命运”。美帝国主义在这无可奈何之中，对于蒋贼却又摆出主人的架子臭骂一顿，这便是美国参院外委会在所谓“援华报告”中对蒋贼政府的“严加谴责”，骂他“腐败无能及官僚主义恶习已在通货膨胀混乱时期更加严重，军事领导方面之愚蠢无能，军队将领间之贪污腐化，已使军队士气大为降低”。但是它奴役中国的反动政策又只能指望这个“愚蠢无能”的走狗来付诸实施，所以美国参院外委会主席范登堡不得不“屡次伸手揩拭其额门上之汗珠”，“费力宣读其声明”，把“报告”“予以撤回”。另一方面，南京小朝廷的大小官儿一见到这个所谓“援华报告”便“表示悲观”，“特别遗憾”，“十分惶恐”了。对美蒋双方这种狼狈不堪穷极无聊的心情，新华社记者说：这是蒋美在这场血腥交易中丑态百出的又一个丑态百出。毫无疑问，在这次罪恶的买卖中，蒋介石匪帮又把中国主权进一步地献给了美帝国主义。蒋家中央社老早就不打自招，报导过美国援蒋计划要包括成立一个“中美协定”，蒋贼须履行各项条款。在其美国主子的各方面监督之下，当贝祖诒在美为此项援助奔走哀号时，津沪各报便透露出蒋美正在进行“开发”华南与台湾的新谈判。新华社记者结语称：美帝国主义这个援蒋新法案和奴役中国的新行动，必将遭到中国人民粉碎的打击。美蒋亡华的新交易，正在进一步激起中国人民和一切正义人士为独立自由而斗争的勇气。中国人民必将更积极地支援解放军的全面进攻，人民解放军必将更英勇的继续夺取侵略者所给予卖国贼的武器，向敌人作战，以作为对美帝国主义向中国人民宣战的最有力和最有效的回答。
