　　Establishing and Improving Democratic Life
　　Zhao Village Pays Attention to Dismantling Factions
　　[Report from our newspaper] Reports from correspondents of the General Branch: In the rectification, democracy, and replenishment campaign in the Ninth District of Wu'an, from the beginning, it consciously broke away from a few people with ambition and vengeful emotions, relied on the vast majority of honest poor peasants and upright middle peasants, dismantled various sectarian small groups remaining among the peasants, supported righteousness, overcame evil, to achieve the consolidated unity of the peasants in thought and organization, and establish a sound democratic life in the countryside. The rectification, democracy, and replenishment campaign is a movement that meets the requirements of all honest poor peasants and upright middle peasants. However, because they had no status in the old society, and because rural democratic life has not been sound enough in recent years, they have been forced to remain silent for a long time, and coupled with concerns about revenge, they dared not come forward at the beginning of the movement. A few people with ambition and vengeful emotions, such as some cadres who had stepped down and individual dishonest retired soldiers, because they or their relatives had been hit, but could not see their own problems, but saw other people's problems very clearly, took the opportunity to incite the masses and create blind and extreme emotions to achieve the goals of one person or a few people. At the beginning of the movement, they were the most active, proactively approached the comrades of the work team, colluded with people, monitored the activities of cadres and party members, and proposed to quickly establish poor peasant associations, take over the militia, and replace village cadres, etc., to curry favor with the "people from above" to gain leadership, using the excuse that they were a "gang" of the masses to oppose the "gang" of party members and cadres. At this time, some comrades of the work team, due to "leftist" impetuosity, were greatly influenced by this emotion and became confused in their thinking. The leadership immediately pointed out clearly: we must never be a tail, and we must never allow using factionalism to oppose factionalism. Only by relying on honest poor peasants, laying a solid foundation, mobilizing the entire poor peasant class to unite all middle peasants, and paying attention to dismantling the sectarian groups remaining among the peasants in every specific action, can we guarantee the normal development of the rectification, democracy, and replenishment campaign.
　　Over the past two months, Zhao Village and other villages have achieved significant results in implementing this policy. First, in the process of reorganizing the peasant ranks, such as absorbing league members, members, and evaluating cadres, enlighten peasants to conduct self-education on the four major standards of "long-term labor, upright character, selflessness, and enthusiastic service." When everyone uses this to measure themselves and others, a new atmosphere of mutual criticism and self-criticism is created in the countryside, righteousness is promoted, evil is attacked, and honest and upright poor peasants and middle peasants are supported to leadership positions, and a few people with leadership desires and factional revenge emotions are naturally eliminated. At the same time, in every specific action, pay attention to dismantling various sectarian groups among the peasants caused by the clan, neighborhood, and other relations left over from the past feudal society. For example, in order to break the "sliceism" in Zhao Village, when electing members of the Farmers' Association and the village government, break the boundaries of the streets and sit separately; and when organizing farmers' representative groups, also not restricted by past neighborhood restrictions, but form mixed groups; in the implementation of drawing and replenishing, land measurement, and evaluating output, the method of disrupting the organization of labor division and cooperation is also adopted to sweep away the remnants of the feudal society in the peasants' minds, such as "we are of the same surname," "we are of this slice," and "we are of this gang." Therefore, when electing members of the Poor Peasants' Association, members of the Farmers' Association, and members of the village government, the peasants all put forward to each other, saying: "No matter whether he is from our street or not, as long as he meets the four major conditions, we will elect him!" This guarantees the realization of the requirements of upright peasants and lays the foundation for establishing a sound rural democratic life. However, to implement this spirit, it is necessary to resolutely struggle against the tendency of tailism, which appears in the form of "mass viewpoint" and "valuable mass enthusiasm." For example, at the beginning of the rectification in Zhao Village, because the work team firmly and clearly supported the masses, the masses began to dare to raise opinions to the party members and cadres. At the first public branch meeting, representatives of the masses all spoke. At this time, an individual retired soldier rushed to speak from his own perspective, with a very strong extreme revenge emotion. The leadership finally spoke, expressing gratitude to the masses for helping to rectify the party, and resolutely ordered the party members to never take revenge on the people; but also pointed out that various factions in the village must be broken. In particular, it was said to the retired soldiers that they had received education from the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, and understood more principles, and should help the party rectification well, which was actually criticizing their factional revenge. After the meeting, the masses were very satisfied and said: "What the work team said is right, he only said that the cadres and party members took more fruits for themselves, why didn't he say anything? If he gains power, he will be even more powerful than bad cadres!" Facts have proved that this kind of timely giving correct opinions to the masses (sometimes naming names, sometimes not naming names) and supporting the masses is by no means a substitute, but is very necessary. This is also an education for people with revenge emotions. For example, a retired soldier in Zhao Village made a better self-criticism in the Poor Peasants' Association and the Farmers' Association group after this meeting, saying that he was wrong to engage in factionalism and wrong to take more fruits in the past. On the contrary, the tailism that appears in the posture of "opposing commandism" is encouraging the extreme emotions of a few people and suppressing the true will of the masses. In Zhao Village and other villages in the Ninth District, although this correct approach occupies a dominant position, due to the fact that the tailism tendency of individual villages and individual comrades still exists, and the masses have not been enlightened to make resolute criticisms and struggles against incorrect tendencies, there are still individual dishonest figures who, starting from their own interests, are dissatisfied with this and dissatisfied with that, and have developed an extreme democratic tendency, which still needs to be overcome.

### 建立健全民主生活　赵庄注意拆散宗派

　　建立健全民主生活
  　赵庄注意拆散宗派
    【本报消息】总分社记者报导：武安九区在这次整党、民主、填补运动中，自开始即清醒地摆脱少数带有野心、报复情绪的人，依托广大老实贫雇和正派中农，拆散残存在农民间的各种宗派小集团，扶植正气，克服邪气，以达到农民在思想上，组织上巩固的团结，建立农村中健全的民主生活。整党、民主、填补运动，是适应全体老实贫雇与正派中农要求的运动，但是由于他们在旧社会里没有地位，而且由于几年来农村民主生活不够健全，以致他们被迫地长期沉默寡言，加以怕报复等顾虑，故当运动之初，表现不敢出头露面，而少数带有野心、报复情绪的人，如一些下台的干部与个别不正派的荣退军人等，因自己或亲属受过打击，而自己有毛病则看不到，对别人毛病看的很清楚，为达到一个人或几个人的目的，便乘机煽动群众，制造盲目偏激情绪。运动刚开始，他们最活跃，主动的接近工作团同志，串连人，监视干部党员的活动，并提议赶快成立贫农团、接收民兵、撤换村干部等，以买好“上边来人”获取领导权，借口说自己是群众的“一伙伙”来反对党员干部的“一伙伙”。这时，工作团某些同志因“左”倾急性病，颇受这种情绪影响，思想发生迷惘，领导上立即明确指出：绝不能做尾巴，绝不允许以宗派反宗派，唯有依靠老实贫雇，把根基扎正，发动整个贫农阶层团结全体中农，在每个具体行动中注意拆散残存于农民间的宗派集团，以保证整党、民主、填补运动的正常发展。
    赵庄等村两个多月来，在贯彻这一方针中获得显著成绩。首先在整编农民队伍过程中，如吸收团员、会员、评选干部等启发农民自我进行“长年劳动、为人正派、大公无私、热心办事”四大标准的教育，当大家以此来衡量自己、衡量别人的时候，便造成农村中互相批评与自我批评的新空气，正气得到发扬，邪气遭受了打击，老实正派的贫雇、中农被拥戴到领导岗位上来，少数有领袖欲，含有宗派报复情绪的人便自然地淘汰下去了。同时在每一具体行动中，注意拆散由于过去封建社会遗留下的宗族、街坊等关系所造成的农民间各种各样的宗派集团，如赵庄为了打破“片片主义”，选举农会与村政府委员时，打破街的界限，分别插开坐；而编农代小组时，亦不受过去街闾限制，混合组成；在实行抽补、丈地、评议产量中，也都采取打乱编制分工合作的办法进行，把封建社会在农民思想上“咱同姓”、“咱这片”、“咱这伙”的余毒一扫而清。因之在选贫农团委员、农会委员和村政府委员时，农民都互相提出说：“不管他是不是咱这街的，只要占四大条件咱就选他！”保证了正派农民要求的实现，给建立健全的农村民主生活打下了基础。但贯彻这一精神，必须随时向以“群众观点”、“宝贵群众热情”等面貌出现的尾巴主义倾向，作坚决的斗争。如赵庄整党初期，由于工作组坚定明确的给群众撑腰，使群众开始敢向党员干部提意见了。在第一次公开的支部会上，群众代表都讲了话，这时有个别荣退军人，从自己出发抢着说话，带有极浓厚的偏激报复情绪。领导上最后发言，对群众帮助整党表示感谢，并坚决命令党员，永远不许向老百姓报复；但对村中各种宗派亦指出必须打破。其中特别对荣退军人，说他们是受过共产党、八路军教育的，懂得道理更多，要好好帮助整党，实际是批评了他们的宗派报复。会后群众都很满意的说：“工作团说的就是啊，他光说人家干部党员，自己多占果实为啥不说说？要叫他得了势，比坏干部还厉害！”事实证明这种及时的给群众正确意见（有时说出名字来，有时不说出名字来）撑腰的作法，绝不是包办代替，而是十分必要的。这对有报复情绪的人，也是一个教育，如赵庄某荣退军人在这次会后，曾在贫农团与农会小组作了较好的自我批评，说自己过去闹宗派不对，多占果实不对。相反，那种以“反对命令主义”的姿态出现的尾巴主义，正鼓励了少数人的偏激情绪，压抑了群众真正的意志。在九区赵庄等村，这种正确作法虽居统治地位，但由于个别村与个别同志的尾巴主义倾向仍然存在，没有启发群众对不正确倾向作坚决的批评与斗争，目前仍有个别不正派人物从自己利益出发，对这也不满意，对那也不满意，发展了极端民主倾向，还需要注意克服。
