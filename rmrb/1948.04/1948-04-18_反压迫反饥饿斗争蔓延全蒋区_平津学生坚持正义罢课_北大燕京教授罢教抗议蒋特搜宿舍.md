Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 14th: According to foreign news agency reports: The righteous struggle of students in Peiping and Tientsin against oppression and hunger has gained widespread support and is "developing into a powerful movement" (Associated Press). Universities in Peiping continue to persist in righteous strikes. Nankai University in Tianjin has decided to continue the strike for three days. Students at Peiping Normal College have put forward the strict demand to punish those who instigated the arrest of students. Protests from faculty members of various universities against the atrocities of Chiang's special agents have been sent to Nanjing. One hundred and eight professors, lecturers, etc., from Yenching University sent a telegram to Li Zongren, director of the Peiping Bandit Suppression Headquarters, who is currently in Nanjing attending the Chiang bandit puppet National Assembly, protesting the arrest of eight students from the Normal College by Chiang's special agents on the night of April 8th. Several American professors from the school also signed the telegram. Over eight thousand students demonstrated on the 9th against oppression and hunger, displaying extreme enthusiasm and bravery. Students from Yenching and Tsinghua Universities traveled thirty miles to participate. Demonstrating students once disregarded Chiang's bandit guards and broke into the bandit suppression headquarters, and also crowded into the courtyard of the bandit police station, giving impassioned speeches and singing patriotic songs, including a majestic song calling on the people to rise up and "oppose foreign (referring to U.S. imperialism) oppression."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 14th: According to foreign news agency reports: Peking University professors went on strike on the 12th (note: teaching assistants and lecturers at the school had already begun striking days ago) to protest Chiang's special agents searching the school's professors' dormitories on the 11th. On the same day, the school's faculty held a meeting and decided to organize a union to protest to Chiang's "central" government. A spokesperson for the union stated: The professors hope that the faculty members of the nine universities in Peiping City will unite to cope with the threats from Chiang's special agents.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 15th: Peiping News: After the incident on the 11th in which Chiang's special agents broke into Peking University, beat students, and searched professors' dormitories, all professors at Peking University began a one-week strike on the 12th to express their serious protest. On the 13th, they also sent a telegram to Hu Shih, the school's president, who is currently in Nanjing, asking him to protest the special agents' atrocities to Chiang's Ministry of Education and other departments of the Chiang government. The professors will also issue a letter to people from all walks of life across the country, calling for support. All associate professors and lecturers at the school also took unanimous action, holding an emergency meeting on the 13th and resolving to accuse the Peiping Chiang bandit authorities of "allowing thugs" to destroy school buildings and dormitories; and decided to invite professors, lecturers, and students from all schools in Peiping to unite and "jointly organize a security committee to protect our lives and safety." All faculty members of Yenching University (including all American professors and members of the school board) also announced on the 13th that they would continue the strike to express their "anger" at the Peking University incident, and issued a declaration stating: "We find it difficult to carry out normal educational work," "Even worse, there are no regulations to protect the safety of teachers and students."
