A letter from the North China Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League: Our work team stationed in Niangniangmiao Village, Daming County, Hebei Province, for two months discovered that the county and district cadres of Daming County, in their efforts to forcibly merge the village's seven agricultural production cooperatives into one large cooperative, not only failed to establish the large cooperative but also affected production and caused unrest among the masses.

In the spring of last year, Niangniangmiao Village organized twenty agricultural production cooperatives. After the autumn harvest, these cooperatives were merged into seven, of which only the Zhang Xishun cooperative and the Jia Jianming cooperative had a relatively solid foundation. Before autumn, the Zhang Xishun cooperative had thirty-five households, and the Jia Jianming cooperative had twenty-five households. After autumn, both cooperatives grew to more than one hundred and twenty households each, with new members accounting for the vast majority. Because the Zhang Xishun cooperative's agricultural production performance was not very good last year, some mutual aid team members felt uneasy after their teams were reorganized into agricultural production cooperatives and were unsure about whether they could manage a large cooperative with more than one hundred and twenty households.

County and district leading organs, in order to establish a provincial banner, decided to establish a large cooperative with more than four hundred households in the village. On November 10th last year, county and district leading cadres formally convened a meeting of the village's agricultural production cooperative directors and accountants to discuss the merger of the cooperatives. On the evening of the 13th, a general meeting of Communist Party members and Youth League members was convened, requiring Party and League members to guarantee the completion of the cooperative merger work. By the 14th, without the members of each cooperative having deliberated on the merger issue, the village cadres announced the merger. When the village cadres went to notify the members of each cooperative to attend the meeting, they said: "Today's meeting is to merge the cooperatives. A large red flag has been erected in the school. The cooperative that arrives under the red flag first is glorious and progressive." At the meeting, although the leading cadres talked about the advantages of a large cooperative, the most impressive thing was that merging into a large cooperative could strive to become the provincial "banner village." The village cadres said at the meeting: "Geng Changsuo's cooperative in Raoyang County has three hundred households already. Our village must surpass it." They also said: "Tomorrow, two of our village's labor models will go to the province to attend a meeting. If we merge the cooperatives today, we can take the materials with us tomorrow." So, they asked at the meeting: "Agree, right?" Party and League members shouted "Agree" in unison, and the directors of each cooperative signed on the spot, which was considered that everyone "agreed." In fact, most of the members disagreed. For example, Wang Jinliang's cooperative had forty-five households, but only four or five households went to the merger meeting, and the other households fundamentally disagreed. The members of the Jia Jianming cooperative's committee only learned about the merger of the large cooperative when they attended the village-wide member meeting, and the vast majority of the members did not know. Many Party and League members also disagreed with the merger, but they were afraid of running into snags if they expressed their opinions at the meeting. League member Liu Huaizhi expressed a non-affirmative opinion on the merger issue at the meeting and was immediately attacked, saying that he was "two-faced" and "sitting on two boats." Some of the masses said: "Party and League members are more numerous than us! We can't do anything even if we disagree." By December 13th, Wang Jinliang's cooperative openly proposed not merging. At that time, the district and village leading cadres were afraid of affecting the work of establishing the large cooperative and damaging the reputation of Niangniangmiao Village, so they did not allow them to withdraw from the cooperative. However, the members of the cooperative were very firm in their demands, and when the cadres went to persuade them, they openly argued with the cadres. Some members said: "In the past, they didn't allow individual farming, but only allowed those who sent letters about individual farming, which is why mutual aid teams were reorganized into cooperatives; now they want to merge into large cooperatives again. More people can't produce more grain, what will we eat!" At this time, except for the Jia Jianming cooperative and the Zhang Xishun cooperative, the members of the other cooperatives said: "People have already taken the lead, just wait and see!" Some said: "The Zhang Xishun cooperative only had thirty-odd households before autumn and already ruined those things, the land is also barren, it will be even worse with more people." Some said: "We're going too fast, we can't catch up even if we take off our shoes." More and more people demanded to withdraw from the cooperative, and the large cooperative collapsed after lasting for nearly a month.

This merger work left a very bad impact.

First, it affected winter production. After the merger, no one accumulated manure. The members said: What's the point of accumulating manure for the cooperative? Which plot of land will it be applied to? At the same time, everyone believed that the higher authorities would issue loans and the cooperative would have soybean cakes, so there was no need to accumulate manure.

Second, because they were busy merging into a large cooperative, some specific problems that needed to be solved urgently by the small cooperatives were not resolved in time. The problems of livestock valuation, private plots, and sideline profit sharing in each cooperative were not handled. Because the problem of livestock valuation was not resolved, in the days after the merger, hundreds of livestock were driven to various markets every day to try to find prices or sell them, and three livestock were sold on one day.

The most serious thing is that some of the masses began to doubt the Party's policies. Originally, some of the masses had an unclear understanding of the future development of society, and this merger violated the principle of voluntariness. Thus, they thought that merging into a cooperative meant "the time had come to eat from the big pot." Hao Peicheng (a Party member, Youth League branch committee member, and cooperative director) reflected: "Now our village is 'three fast, four busy.'" The three fasts are fast meat, fast wine, and fast cigarettes; the four busies are the busy selling meat, the busy selling wine, the busy selling cigarettes, and the busy cooking. According to our understanding, the village's supply and marketing cooperative sold 681 jin of wine in June, 603 jin in November, and 722 jin in the twenty days from December 1st to 20th. Jia Keda, a prosperous middle peasant, fried dishes and drank wine in the wine shop. When asked why he was drinking like this, he said: "This year the merger didn't succeed, but will it not succeed next year? Once we merge, it won't be up to us!" In the past, the village's land prices were very expensive, but now the land is cheap and no one buys it.

The village did not have the conditions to run a large cooperative with several hundred households, but the leading cadres insisted on merging cooperatives against the wishes of the masses. This is the fundamental reason for the failure of this merger. The cooperative led by Zhang Xishun, a labor model in the village, had only thirty-odd households before last autumn and had not been managed well. The masses did not trust Zhang Xishun to run a large cooperative. Some of the masses said: "If thirty-odd households were not managed well, giving a four-hundred-household cooperative to him would mean starvation." From this situation, it can be seen that it is impossible to run a large cooperative without running a small cooperative well. However, the leading cadres did not understand the masses' ideological situation and blindly believed that: "Merging into a large cooperative is the urgent desire of the majority of the masses, only Zhang Shixiang's cooperative has twelve households with ideological problems, and the other cooperatives are fine." "The new members are like bubbles in the river, they just follow the current, there's nothing else." When the masses proposed not merging, the county and district cadres living in the village also believed that: the masses did not merge because the Party members were busy participating in Party rectification and did not carry out work, and evil forces were rising below. The secretary of the village's general Party branch said to the members who requested to withdraw from the cooperative: "Everyone came here for the model, if we don't merge into a large cooperative, will this labor model still be maintained? Are you obeying the leadership?" From these situations, it can be seen that the failure of the Niangniangmiao Village to establish a large cooperative and the many bad impacts left behind were entirely caused by the leading cadres' blind pursuit of the "banner village" and their commandist style of work.

### 河北大名娘娘庙村盲目办大社的教训

    河北大名娘娘庙村盲目办大社的教训
    中国新民主主义青年团华北工作委员会来信：我们派到河北省大名县娘娘庙村的工作组，在该村住了两个月，发现大名县的县、区干部，因为要勉强把该村的七个农业生产合作社并成一个大社，结果不但大社办不起来，反而影响了生产，造成群众情绪不安。
    娘娘庙村在去年春天组织了二十个农业生产合作社。秋后各社合并为七个社，其中只有张希顺社和贾建明社比较有基础。秋前张希顺社有三十五户，贾建明社二十五户，秋后两社各发展到一百二十多户。两个社新社员占最大多数。因为去年张希顺社的农业生产成绩不太好，有些互助组组员从互助组改组为农业生产合作社以后，情绪还有些不安，对于是否能够搞好有一百二十多户参加的大社，心里还不摸底。
    县、区领导机关为了要树立全省旗帜，决定在该村办一个有四百多户参加的大社。去年十一月十日，县、区领导干部正式召集该村各农业生产合作社社长和会计开会商量并社问题，十三日晚就召开了中共党员、青年团员大会，要党员、团员保证完成并社工作。到十四日，各社社员对并社问题没有经过酝酿，村干部就宣布并社。村干部去通知各社社员来开会时说：“今天要开会并社，学校里立了一面大红旗，那个社先到红旗底下就是光荣的进步的。”在大会上，虽然领导干部讲了一下大社的优越性，但给人印象最深的是：并成大社可以争取当全省的“旗帜村”。村干部在大会上讲：“饶阳县耿常锁社都三百多户了，咱们村要超过它。”又说：“明天咱村两个劳动模范要到省里开会，今天并成社，明天就把材料带走。”于是，就在大会上问：“同意呗？”党、团员一齐喊“同意”，当场便由各社社长签了名，算是大家都“同意”了。实际上是大部社员都不同意。如王金亮社四十五户，开并社大会时只去了四、五户，其他各户根本不同意。贾建明社的社务委员都是到开全村社员大会时才知道要并大社，绝大多数的社员都不知道。有不少党、团员也不同意并社，但他们怕在大会发表意见碰钉子。团员刘怀志在会上对并社问题发表了不肯定的意见，立即遭到攻击，说他“两面光”、“脚登两只船”。有的群众说：“党、团员比我们群众多！我们不同意也不行。”到十二月十三日，王金亮社便公开提出不并社了。当时区、村领导干部怕影响办大社工作，怕影响娘娘庙村的名声，不让他们出社。但该社社员要求很坚决，干部去说服便和干部公开顶起嘴来。有的社员说：“过去不让单干，光让单干的送信，才把互助组改组成了社；现在又让并大社，人多打不了粮食，吃啥！”这时除贾建明社，张希顺社外，其他各社的社员有的说：“人家已经出头了，等着吧！”有的说：“张希顺社秋前才三十余户，就蹧踏了那些东西，地也荒了，人多更办不好。”有的说：“走的太快了，脱了鞋也赶不上。”要求退社的人越来越多，大社保持了将近一个月就垮台了。
    这一次并社工作，留下了很坏的影响。
    首先是影响了冬季生产。并社后，大家都不积肥，社员们都说：入社积肥做啥？上到那块地里？同时大家认为有上级给发贷款，社里有豆饼，用不着积肥了。
    其次，因为忙于并大社，使各小社亟待解决的一些具体问题没有及时解决。各社的入社牲口作价、自留地、副业分红等问题都没有处理。因为牲口作价的问题没有解决，在并社以后的几天当中，每天有百来头牲口被赶到各地集上去试价或出卖，有一天就卖了三头牲口。
    最严重的是有部分群众对党的政策发生了怀疑。本来有一部分群众对社会发展前途认识不清，这次并社又违反了自愿原则，这样他们便以为并社就是“到了吃大锅饭的时候了”。郝培成（是党员、青年团支部委员、社长）反映说：“现在我村是‘三快、四忙。’”三快是肉快、酒快、烟快；四忙是卖肉的忙、卖酒的忙、卖烟的忙、作饭的忙。据我们了解该村供销合作社的酒六月份卖出六百八十一斤，十一月份卖六百零三斤，十二月一号至二十号二十天就卖了七百二十二斤。富裕中农贾可大在酒铺里炒菜喝酒，问他为啥这样喝，他说：“今年并社没有并成，明年还并不成呀！合了大伙还由自己！”以前该村地价很贵，现在地贱也没有人买。
    该村还没有办几百户的大社的条件，而领导干部硬要违反群众的自愿去并社，这是这次并社失败的根本原因。该村劳动模范张希顺领导的社，去年秋天以前只有三十余户还没有搞好。群众对张希顺办大社是不信任的。有些群众说：“三十余户没搞好，四百户的社交给他就得挨饿。”从这种情况可以看出，小社没有办好，就要办大社是不可能的。但领导干部不了解群众思想情况，盲目地认为：“并大社是多数群众的迫切要求，只是张世祥社有十二户思想不通，别的社没有事。”“新社员是河里水泡，随了大流，别的没有啥。”在群众提出不并社时，住在该村的县、区干部还认为：群众不并社是因为党员忙于参加整党，没有进行工作，下边邪气上升了。该村中共总支书记对要求退社的社员说：“大伙是朝着模范来的，不并大社，这劳动模范还保持住了不？你们是不是服从领导？”从这些情况可以看出：娘娘庙村办大社所以失败并留下许多坏影响，完全是领导干部盲目追求“旗帜村”的锦标主义思想和强迫命令作风所造成的。
