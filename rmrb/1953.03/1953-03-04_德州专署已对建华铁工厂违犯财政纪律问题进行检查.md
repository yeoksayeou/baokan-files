    Dezhou Commissioner's Office Investigates Jianhua Iron Factory for Violations of Financial Discipline
    Letter from the Dezhou Commissioner's Office, Shandong: The January 21st "Letters from Readers" column published a letter from reader Fan Ling, criticizing the Qihe Normal School of Dezhou Prefecture (mistakenly referred to as Qihe County Middle School in the original letter), as well as the Zhengye Iron Factory, Jianhua Iron Factory, and Electric Power Company under the Dezhou Industrial Company, for violating financial discipline and causing losses to state property. We have studied the materials we already had and organized a team to first investigate the Jianhua Iron Factory. After a preliminary investigation, more problems have been discovered. We will deal with the issues after clarifying all the problems and inform you of the results.

    德州专署已对建华铁工厂违犯财政纪律问题进行检查
    山东德州专署来信：一月二十一日“读者来信”栏发表了读者范凌的来信，批评德州专区齐河师范学校（原批评信中误为齐河县中学）以及德州实业公司所属振业铁工厂、建华铁工厂和电力公司等单位违犯财政纪律，造成国家资财的损失。我们研究了过去已有的材料，并组织力量先对建华铁工厂进行检查。经初步检查，已发现了更多的问题；待将全部问题弄清后即作处理，并将结果告诉你们。
