    We share your grief at the passing of our beloved leader and teacher, the genius successor of the immortal doctrines of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, the genius architect of communism, the invincible standard-bearer of the world peace camp, and the great friend of the Polish people.

Stalin's immortal cause and life will inspire and guide the daily labor of the Polish people and their struggle to build a new socialist system, and will be the banner of the struggle for the victory of the ideas of peace, progress, and the freedom of working people all over the world. Under the banner of the greatest warrior and genius of our time, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, we have united into a close formation and armed ourselves with vigilance. We vow that we must be faithful to his teachings, unswervingly implement the principles of internationalism and the unity of all working people, and defend the rights and achievements of the people, the unbreakable guarantee of these rights and achievements being the eternal friendship and fraternal unity with the Soviet Union.
    Friends, Comrades! We assure you that the Polish people will spare no effort to make more and greater creative contributions in the common struggle to realize the great immortal ideas, doctrines, and instructions of Stalin.

Telegram of Condolence from the Italian Communist Party Central Committee
[Xinhua News Agency, March 11th] TASS, Moscow, March 11th: The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party sent the following telegram of condolence to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, on behalf of the Italian Communists, the working people of Italy, and the entire people, expresses its deep condolences to all the people of the Soviet Union on the passing of Comrade Stalin, the faithful leader of all progressive humanity. The working class and the people of Italy will never forget that the decisive victory that liberated them is due to Stalin's doctrine and cause.
    Comrade Stalin, together with Lenin, led the people to the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, laid the foundation of the socialist state, made this country immune to the aggression of all enemies and consolidated it, built socialism in this country, and discovered and pointed out the path of transition to communism. All these great victories illuminate the path of our people and the people of the world, enabling them to move forward.
    During the difficult years of fascist reactionary rule, Stalin's doctrine, his unprecedented victories in building and defending socialism, were a concrete guarantee for the Italian people to get rid of fascism, poverty, and oppression. Inspired by the names of Lenin and Stalin, tens of thousands of Italian communists and anti-fascists unflinchingly endured imprisonment, persecution, and died without yielding, believing that they were not sacrificing in vain. In the just national liberation war, the best sons of the Italian people, our glorious guerrillas, the fighters for freedom, inspired by the doctrine and example of the great Stalin, took up arms, drove the invaders out of Italian territory, and raised the national flag from the mud. The brilliant example of the great Stalin, his doctrine and cause, showed the people the prospect of a new society, never seen in history, built on the freedom, justice, and peace of the people. They inspire and guide the Italian people to fight for a bright future, to get rid of exploitation, ignorance, and fear.
    Stalin taught us that the representatives of communist and democratic parties must raise the banner of democracy, freedom, independence, and national sovereignty, which has been abandoned by the reactionary bourgeoisie, and move forward with it. Stalin taught us that the main task of the world working class and working people is to defend peace. Stalin taught us that the strength of the communists lies in unity, ideological, political, and organizational unity, which is the main weapon to accomplish the historical task of the working class and all working people.
    We must be loyal to these teachings, and we firmly believe that the first guarantee of our struggle for independence, freedom, and national sovereignty is the existence of the world's first socialist country, the invincible strength of the Soviet Union.
    We must further strengthen our party and its unity, consolidate and expand its ties with the masses. We vow that we will forever be loyal to the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and that we will deepen and popularize the invincible theoretical knowledge of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in our ranks.
    The Italian Communist Party believes that the interests of the Soviet Union are inseparable from the cause of peace and independence of all nations. The Italian Communist Party reiterates its guarantee to stop the imperialist warmongers and any action that dares to embark on the road of aggression again and infringe on the freedom and independence of the Soviet nationalities. The imperialist warmongers and their servants in our country should not have any illusions. The Italian people will never fight against the Soviet Union, the socialist homeland, the peoples of the land of Lenin and Stalin.
    The name of Joseph Stalin, the leader and teacher of the struggle for human liberation and progress, will live forever.
    Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Italian people and the peoples of the Soviet Union!
                Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party (signed)

Telegram of Condolence from the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States
      [Xinhua News Agency, March 11th] TASS, Moscow, March 11th: The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States sent the following telegram of condolence to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union:
    The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States expresses its deepest sympathy to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and all the people of the great socialist country for the irreparable loss suffered – the passing of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the beloved teacher, leader and guide of millions of working people throughout the world. We, along with you and millions of grieving people, deeply mourn the unfortunate passing of the heroic peace fighter, the indomitable anti-fascist fighter, and the steadfast socialist builder.
    Despite the attempts of the hysterical and panic-stricken capitalist warmongers to fan up mad slander against this great and righteous son of the people in our country, Joseph Stalin remains the dearest person in the world, and he will forever live in the hearts of the people all over the world, for whose happiness he selflessly fought throughout his life.
    His spirit of sacrifice, his loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, his creative development of Marxism-Leninism, his love and care for the people, his hatred and contempt for all exploiters and autocratic dictators, his steadfastness in the face of all enemies of peace and progress, his joy in the freedom and happiness of the people in socialist society, and his infinite loyalty to the cause of peace are an immortal example for communists and all freedom-loving people around the world.
    At this critical moment, his passing is a heavy loss for all mankind. It is difficult to say the words "Stalin is dead," because these words make people in the most remote corners of the world feel grief and anxiety. But the great strength of the peace-loving people of the world, in whom Stalin trusted, will raise the banner of peace and prevent the rise of fascism and the occurrence of world war.
    We know that the great heart of Joseph Stalin continues to beat in the hearts of the peace-loving Soviet people and the hearts of the heroic and invincible Communist Party members. We know that your deep desire for lasting peace is shared by the people of all other countries in the world, including the American people, although some of them may be misguided and bewildered. Joseph Stalin continues to live in his work and immortal writings. Comrade Stalin will forever live in the memory of the people of your vast country who love him, in the memory of the people of the Eastern European people's democracies and the Chinese people who love him, in the memory of the people of the oppressed colonial countries who love him, and in the memory of the exploited workers and peasants in the capitalist countries who love him, including our white and black people. The responsibility for the struggle for freedom and peace unites them.
    We, the American Communists, today lower our flag to mourn our most beloved Comrade Stalin. We, along with millions of mourners around the world, extend our deepest condolences to his country, the Soviet people, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In memory of him, we will commemorate him in the future by intensifying the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism, and by not succumbing to the persecution and suffering inflicted upon us. We will redouble our efforts to unite the people of the United States, black and white, so that the Wall Street atomic maniacs cannot plunge mankind into a sea of blood and prevent the implementation of their fascist plan to rule the world.
    One of Joseph Stalin's last wise calls was to call on the working people of capitalist countries to raise the banner of democratic freedom and national independence, which has been abandoned by the bourgeoisie. In memory of him, we will strive to achieve this goal and save our country and people from the disaster of fascism and war. Comrade Stalin will forever live in the shining tomorrow of the socialist life of all mankind that is about to come in the new world. William Z. Foster, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Pettis Perry

Stalin, whose comprehensive and far-sighted wisdom universally illuminates the path of the struggle of the working people of the world.

The liberation movement in the colonial dependent countries is unprecedentedly high. We will spare no effort to fight for the path pointed out to us by the immortal Stalin until the final victory. We express unlimited trust and unwavering loyalty to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its leadership, which was personally cultivated by Stalin. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the party established and educated by Lenin and Stalin, the party that has been tempered in battle, and its supreme criterion is to serve the working people.

    我们敬爱的领袖和导师、不朽的马克思、恩格斯、列宁学说的天才继承者、共产主义的天才建筑师、世界和平阵营的不可战胜的旗手、波兰人民的伟大朋友逝世了，我们和你们同样感到悲痛。由于他，波兰人民获得了自由，并且从民族和社会压迫的枷锁下解放了出来。斯大林不朽的事业和生平，将鼓舞和指引着波兰人民的日常劳动和为建设新的社会主义的制度而斗争，并将是为和平、进步、全世界劳动人民的自由这种思想获得胜利而斗争的旗帜。我们在最伟大的战士和当代的天才约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林的旗帜下，已团结成紧密的队伍，并且已用警惕性武装起来。我们宣誓：我们一定要忠实于他的学说，不屈不挠地执行国际主义及全体劳动人民团结的原则，保卫人民的权利和成果，这些权利和成果的牢不可破的保障，就是跟苏联永恒的友谊和兄弟的团结。
    朋友们，同志们！我们向你们保证：波兰人民将不遗余力地在为实现伟大的斯大林的永垂不朽的思想、学说和指示这一共同斗争中作更多和更大的创造性的贡献。

                      波兰人民共和国部长会议
                                波莱斯瓦夫·贝鲁特
                      波兰人民共和国国务委员会

    意共中央的唁电
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：意大利共产党中央委员会致苏联共产党中央委员会的唁电如下：意大利共产党中央委员会代表意大利共产党人、意大利的劳动人民和全体人民，对全体进步人类的忠实领袖斯大林同志的逝世，向苏联全体人民表示深切的哀悼。工人阶级和意大利人民永远不会忘记：使他们获得解放的决定性的胜利应归功于斯大林的学说和事业。
    斯大林同志和列宁一起领导人民取得了十月社会主义革命的胜利，奠定了社会主义国家的基础，使得这个国家不受一切敌人的侵略并巩固了这个国家，在这个国家建设了社会主义，发现并指明了过渡到共产主义的道路。所有这些伟大的胜利照亮了我国人民和全世界人民的道路，使他们得以迈步前进。
    在法西斯反动统治的艰苦岁月中，斯大林的学说、他的建设和保卫社会主义的政策的史无前例的胜利，对意大利人民说来是摆脱法西斯主义、贫穷和压迫的具体保证。在列宁和斯大林两个名字的鼓舞下，成千成万的意大利共产党人和反法西斯人士不屈不挠地忍受了监禁、迫害的痛苦并且至死不屈，他们相信他们决不是白白牺牲的。在正义的民族解放战争中，意大利人民的最优秀的儿女、我们光荣的游击队、争取自由的战士们在伟大斯大林的学说和榜样的鼓舞下，拿起了武器，从意大利土地上赶走了侵略者，从泥泞中竖起了国旗。伟大斯大林的辉煌榜样、他的学说和事业使人民看到了一个历史上从来没有过的、建筑在人民的自由、正义与和平之上的新社会的远景。它们鼓舞和指导意大利人民为争取美好的前途、摆脱剥削、无知和恐惧而进行斗争。
    斯大林教导我们说：共产主义和民主的政党的代表们必须举起被反动资产阶级抛在一边的民主、自由、独立和民族主权这面旗帜，打着它前进。斯大林教导我们说：世界工人阶级和劳动人民的主要任务是保卫和平。斯大林教导我们说：共产党人的力量团结一致，思想、政治、组织上的团结一致，便是完成工人阶级和全体劳动人民的历史性任务的主要武器。
    我们一定要忠于这些遗训，我们坚决相信：我们争取独立、自由和民族主权的斗争的第一个保证就是世界第一个社会主义国家的存在，就是苏联不可战胜的力量。
    我们一定要进一步加强我们的党和它的团结，巩固并扩大它与群众的联系。我们宣誓：我们要永远忠于无产阶级国际主义的精神，要使战无不胜的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论知识在我们的队伍中深入和普及。
    意大利共产党相信苏联的利益和各民族的和平及独立的事业是分不开的，意大利共产党再度保证要制止帝国主义战争贩子和任何敢于重新走上侵略道路、侵犯苏联各民族自由和独立的行动。帝国主义战争贩子和他们在我们国家内的仆从们不要幻想了。意大利人民决不和苏联、社会主义的国土、列宁和斯大林的国土上各族人民作战。
    争取人类解放和进步的斗争的领袖和导师约瑟夫·斯大林的名字永垂不朽。
    苏联共产党万岁！
    意大利人民和苏联各族人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！

    美共全国委员会的唁电
      【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：美国共产党全国委员会致苏联共产党中央委员会的唁电如下：
    美国共产党全国委员会向苏联共产党中央委员会和伟大的社会主义国家全体人民所遭受的不可挽回的损失——敬爱的导师、全世界千百万劳动人民的领袖和引路人约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林的逝世，表示最深切的同情。我们和你们、和千百万悲哀的人民一同深切地痛悼英勇的和平战士、不屈不挠的反法西斯主义的战士、坚定不拔的社会主义建设者的不幸逝世。
    尽管歇斯底里的和惊惶失措的资本主义战争贩子企图在我们国内对这个伟大的、正直的人民儿子疯狂地煽起恶毒的诽谤，约瑟夫·斯大林仍然是世界上最亲爱的人，他将永远活在他曾为其幸福忘我地奋斗终生的全世界人民的心中。
    他的牺牲精神、他对马克思列宁主义原则的忠诚、他对马克思列宁主义创造性的发展、他对人民的爱护和关怀、他对所有剥削者和专制独裁者的仇恨和蔑视、他在一切和平和进步的敌人面前所表现的刚毅、他对社会主义社会中人民的自由和幸福所感到的愉快、他对和平事业无限的忠诚，是共产党和全世界爱好自由的人民永生不灭的榜样。
    在这个紧要关头，他的逝世是全人类沉重的损失。人们很难说出“斯大林逝世了”这句话，因为这句话使世界上最遥远的角落里的人都感到悲痛和焦虑。但是斯大林所信任的全世界爱好和平的人民巨大力量将打起和平大旗，阻止法西斯主义的兴起和世界大战的发生。
    我们知道：约瑟夫·斯大林伟大的心继续在爱好和平的苏联人民和英勇的不可战胜的共产党党员的心中跳动着。我们知道：你们争取持久和平的深厚愿望是全世界其他各国人民所共有的；这些人民中包括美国人民在内，尽管他们有些人可能被引入迷途而惶惑起来。约瑟夫·斯大林继续活在他的工作和不朽的著作中。斯大林同志将永远活在热爱他的你们幅员广阔的国家的人民的记忆中，活在热爱他的东欧各人民民主国家和中国人民的记忆中，活在热爱他的被压迫的殖民地国家人民的记忆中，活在包括我国白人、黑人在内的热爱他的资本主义国家中被剥削的工人和农民的记忆中。为自由与和平而斗争的责任把他们团结起来。
    我们，美国共产党人，今天降低我们的旗帜来追悼我们最敬爱的斯大林同志。我们和全世界千百万哀悼的人民一道向他的国家、苏联人民和苏联共产党致以最深切的吊唁。为了纪念他，我们以后将用加紧争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争、不因加在我们身上的迫害和痛苦而屈服来纪念他。我们将加倍努力地团结美国的人民，黑人和白人，使华尔街原子狂者不能把人类投入血海中，阻止他们要统治世界的法西斯计划的实施。
    约瑟夫·斯大林最后的英明号召之一，是号召资本主义国家的劳动人民举起已为资产阶级抛弃的民主自由和民族独立的旗帜。为了纪念他，我们将努力实现这个目标，拯救我们的国家和人民免于法西斯主义和战争的灾难。斯大林同志将永远活在即将到来的全人类社会主义生活的灿烂明天的新世界里。威廉·兹·福斯特，伊丽沙白·葛莱·弗林，佩蒂斯·佩里
