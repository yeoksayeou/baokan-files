How to Make the Masses Accept the Marriage Law
Dong Dong, Deputy Secretary of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

After Shijiazhuang City conducted intensive and general training for cadres at the city, district, factory, enterprise, street, and village levels, the publicity campaign for the Marriage Law among the masses has begun in some areas. In addition to the 416 cadres organized by the city and various districts to directly promote the Marriage Law, the city and districts have also intensively trained 2,105 key grassroots cadres from streets, villages, and factories. All five districts and two half-districts in the city have conducted general training for 9,460 cadres above the group leader level. In order to further mobilize and rely on the masses, and to achieve a close combination of leadership and the masses, District One has universally established groups based on courtyards below the level of the lane chief. Those selected as group leaders are people who are usually supported by the masses. After education and training on the Marriage Law, these cadres and new forces have become the backbone of publicizing the Marriage Law and maintaining close contact with the broad masses of citizens. The publicity comprehensively explained the policies and addressed the specific ideological problems of the masses in light of their thinking and their immediate interests. Therefore, some achievements have been made in the initial stage.

The experiences in publicity are roughly as follows:

(1) Publicity Should Be Targeted at Specific Objects

When publicizing, it is important to be good at distinguishing the types of thinking among the masses, determine the main ideological problems to be solved, and prescribe the right medicine. For example, when the work team of District Six was working in Yuchun Village, they knew that Wang Shuangyin's mother was relatively backward, treated her daughter-in-law poorly, restricted her from attending people's schools, and did not allow her to attend meetings. She also did not discuss family matters with her. When the comrades of the work team talked to Wang Shuangyin's mother, they focused on how to live a good life and then extended it to family unity, harmony between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, etc., which greatly moved her. She said, "The divorce of the two daughters-in-law in the past was all my fault! I can't treat this daughter-in-law like that in the future. I will let her attend people's school, and we will discuss things at home." Shi Junheng of Dama Village, District Six, often beat his wife. Shi himself admitted that he was addicted to beating his wife. When a women's meeting was held in the village, Shi Junheng was afraid that his wife would reflect badly on him, so he also went to the women's meeting. People asked him why he came to the meeting, and he said, "I also want to listen!" At the meeting, the cadres focused on the various aspects of the relationship between husband and wife in light of his thinking, and also emphasized that a good relationship between husband and wife is the only way to live a good life. Shi Junheng felt that there was something to it, and he broke his original wrong ideas. When a men's meeting was held in the village, he was the first to arrive. He said at the meeting, "I understand that fighting cannot solve the problem. In the past, the more I fought, the more awkward it became, and the more awkward I became, the more I wanted to fight. Fellow villagers, watch! I guarantee that I won't fight anymore in the future."

(2) Combining Meeting Explanations with Individual Visits

At the meeting, policies can only be explained in light of general ideological problems, which makes it difficult to solve the specific thinking of some people. This requires a combination of explanations at the meeting and individual visits. However, these individual visits can only be gradually deepened from far to near by chatting about everyday matters, and family problems must not be questioned. For example, an old woman named Yin Chunlu in No. 9 Street, District One, usually treated her daughter-in-law badly, had concerns about implementing the Marriage Law, and did not allow her daughter-in-law to attend meetings related to the Marriage Law. She herself did not participate either, and often slipped away before the meeting started. The comrades of the publicity team learned about this situation and also learned that Yin Chunlu herself had grown up as a child bride and had suffered a lot in the past. Once, when a meeting was called again, a woman from the same courtyard persuaded her to attend the meeting. At the meeting, the comrades of the publicity team spoke of the typical examples of family harmony and the suffering of child brides. Yin Chunlu was restless on the spot. After the meeting, the publicity team found Yin's house, and as soon as they entered the door, Yin Chunlu said, "I guessed you would come. I couldn't figure it out before, and I did something wrong. What was said at the meeting touched my heart. I was a child bride before, and I can't finish talking about the suffering I endured in three days. I will definitely treat my daughter-in-law like my own daughter in the future, and I can't let her be angry again."

(3) Contrast

"Contrast" is an effective method and can be widely used in large and small meetings on Marriage Law and in individual conversations. For example, at the typical report conference on the Marriage Law in No. 13 Street, District One, a widow who had been widowed for many years and remarried freely after liberation spoke at the conference. She used vivid facts to compare her life before and after remarriage, which made many people understand the benefits of widows being able to remarry freely. At the same meeting, Liu Guichen recounted the pain he had suffered from being married twice by arrangement and the happy life he now had after marrying freely. This was very educational to the masses and greatly promoted the deepening of the movement. Wu, an old lady in her sixties in District Three, disliked her granddaughter's dating. Once, her granddaughter brought her lover home to see her, and the old lady scolded them out. Zhang Ruizheng, a small businessman across the street from the Wu family, had been unhappy because his parents arranged his marriage, but later divorced and married on his own. He lived a happy life and swept half the street every morning. Street cadre Zhang Hanchen used this practical example to carry out a powerful contrast publicity. This moved the old lady Wu. After the granddaughter returned home, the old lady Wu expressed her attitude to her granddaughter and no longer interfered with her marriage. The old lady said, "If I don't manage it well, I will be blamed in the future."

(4) Publicity Should Be Combined with Specific Problems

Wang Suqin, an old lady in District Three, firmly opposed her daughter Huang Shuyun dating someone. Although Huang Shuyun was often angry about this, she still insisted on freedom of marriage. Wang Suqin finally put forward two conditions: 1. It is okay to get married, but you have to take care of me for the rest of my life, take care of me in my old age and bury me; 2. After marriage, the man has to come to live in my house and be considered a member of my family. The man firmly refused. Street cadres used specific events to publicize to Wang Suqin: A man named Kang on this street did not make any conditions before marrying a woman, and took good care of the woman's parents after marriage; at the same time, the street cadres also explained to both sides the provisions of the Marriage Law regarding the obligations of children to their parents. Wang Suqin figured it out and agreed to Huang Shuyun's free marriage. The old couple were happy, and they were very active in calling for work on the street, and digging out fly pupae was the best in the whole street.

(5) Organizing Mass Discussions Under Leadership

After reading the newspaper or explaining it to the masses, it is important to guide the masses to discuss it in a planned way. This is an important key to solving the ideological problems of the masses; however, the leadership should not directly answer the questions raised by the masses, but can hand them over to the masses for discussion and propose their own opinions, but the cadres must give correct guidance to prevent deviations. For example, there was a fierce debate in No. 5 Street, District One, on the issue of how women can be liberated. The majority of the opinion was: Women must go out to work in order to be liberated. Later, a worker's family member raised a different opinion. She said, "We have four children. I cook for six people every day and take care of four children. Although I don't work, laboring at home is the same. I am not angry either." After her explanation, everyone had a more comprehensive understanding of the issue of women's liberation. When discussing equality between men and women in No. 9 Street, many people still felt that women were not very useful and that women were not as good as men. Wang Shuzhen, a widow, educated everyone with her own vivid facts. She said, "After I got married, I gave birth to my first daughter, and my parents-in-law didn't think much about it. When I gave birth to my second daughter, I was scolded by my mother-in-law for being useless. From then on, I couldn't stop being angry; later, I gave birth to two more children, all daughters, and even my father-in-law scolded me. But after liberation, daughters are the same as sons. My three older daughters all work on the railway and serve the country equally. I can't eat or use up the money I earn every month. My fourth daughter is still studying and will be able to work in the future. I don't agree with anyone who says women are not good." Her words dealt a severe blow to the idea of ​​valuing men over women.

    怎样才能使群众接受婚姻法
    中共石家庄市委副书记　董东
    石家庄市经过对市、区、厂矿、企业、街村各级干部的集训和普训以后，对群众贯彻婚姻法的宣传，已在部分地区开始了。除了市和各区组织了四百一十六名干部直接进行婚姻法宣传外，又由市、区集训了街、村、工厂基层主要干部二千一百零五名，全市五个区加两半个区共普训小组长以上干部九千四百六十名。一区为了进一步发动与依靠群众，达到领导与群众紧密结合，在闾长以下普遍建立了基本上以院为基础的小组，被选为小组长的都是平日为群众所拥护的人。这些干部和新生力量，经过婚姻法的教育训练以后，都成了宣传婚姻法并与广大市民群众有着密切联系的骨干。宣传中全面交代了政策，并针对群众思想，联系群众的切身利益，解决了群众具体的思想问题，因此，在初期内已取得一些成绩。
    宣传的经验，大体有以下几点：
    （一）宣传要看具体对象
    宣传时要善于分别群众思想类型，确定要解决的主要思想问题，对症下药。如六区工作组在榆村工作时，知道王双印他娘比较落后，对待儿媳妇不大好，限制儿媳上民校，不叫儿媳开会，家里的事也不和儿媳商量。工作组同志找王双印他娘谈话时，就着重讲怎样过好日子，再引申到家庭团结、婆媳和睦等问题上去，使她大受感动，说：“以前两个媳妇离婚都是怨我的过！以后待这个媳妇可不能那样了，要叫她上民校，家里有事商量着办。”六区大马村石俊衡常打骂老婆，石自己承认打老婆有瘾。在村里召开妇女会议时，石俊衡怕自己老婆反映他不好，也跟着去开妇女会去了。人们问他为啥来开会，他说：“我也愿听听！”会上干部们针对他的思想，着重讲了夫妇关系中各方面的问题，也着重说明了搞好夫妇关系才能过好日子。石俊衡一听有门，打破了自己原来的错误想法。在村里召开男人会时，他第一个先到场。他在会上说：“我明白了，光打架解决不了问题；过去越打越别扭，越别扭越想打。乡亲们看着！以后保险不打架了。”
    （二）会议讲解和个别访问相结合
    在会上只能针对一般的思想问题讲明政策，这样对有些人的具体思想还不易解决，这就需要会上讲和个别访问结合起来。但这种个别访问只能由远而近地拉家常逐步深入，决不能追问家庭问题。如一区九街一位老太婆叫尹春露，平日对儿媳不好，对贯彻婚姻法有顾虑，不叫儿媳参加有关婚姻法的会议，自己也不参加，常常是不到开会时间自己就溜走了。宣传小组的同志了解到这种情况，又了解到尹春露本人原来也是由童养媳长大的，过去受了不少罪。一次又召集会时，同院的一个妇女劝说她参加了会。会上，宣传小组的同志们从家庭和睦的典型事例讲到童养媳的苦处，尹春露当场就坐立不安。会后宣传小组找到尹家，一进门尹春露就说：“我估摸着你们一定来。以前自己想不开，办错了事。会上说的事算说到我心里去了。我早先当童养媳，受的苦三天也说不完。以后我一定待媳妇和亲闺女一样，可不能再叫她受气了。”
     （三）对比
    “对比”是一个有效方法，在宣传婚姻法的大小会议和个别谈话中都可以广泛应用。比如一区十三街在婚姻法典型报告大会上，一个多年守寡、解放后自由结婚的寡妇在大会上讲了话，她用生动的事实对比了改嫁前后的生活，使许多人明白了寡妇可以自由改嫁的好处。同一个会上，刘贵臣诉说了他两次被包办结婚所带来的痛苦，和现在自由结婚以后的幸福生活，对群众教育很深，大大地推动了运动的深入进展。三区有个六十多岁的吴老太太，看不惯自己的孙女恋爱，一次孙女领着自己爱人到家来看，被老太太骂了出来。吴家对门有个小商张瑞徵，曾因父母包办结婚不顺心，后来离婚，自主结了婚，生活美满，每天早晨打扫卫生扫半条街。街干部张汉臣就用这个实际例子，进行了有力的对比宣传。就这样，打动了吴老太太的心。孙女回家后，吴老太太向孙女表示了态度，对她的亲事不干涉了，老太太说：“管不好将来也会落埋怨。”
    （四）宣传要和具体问题结合
    三区老太太王素琴，坚决反对女儿黄淑云和人恋爱。黄淑云为这事虽然经常受气，但仍是坚持婚姻自由。王素琴最后提出两个条件：一、结婚也行，得管我一辈子，养老送终；二、结婚后男的得到我家来住，算我家人。男方坚决拒绝。街干部就用具体的事件，向王素琴进行宣传：这个街上一个姓康的和一妇女结婚前也没订任何条件，结婚后对女方父母侍奉的很好；同时街干部也向两方面说明婚姻法上关于子女对父母义务的规定。王素琴想通了，同意了黄淑云自由结婚。老两口心里痛快了，对街上号召的工作很积极，挖蝇蛹在全街数第一。
    （五）有领导地组织群众讨论
    读报或向群众讲解后，要有计划地引导群众讨论，这是解决群众思想问题的重要关键；但对群众提出来的问题，领导上不要直接答复，可交群众讨论提出自己的意见，但干部必须给以正确引导，防止偏差。如一区五街在讨论中对妇女怎样才能解放的问题，有激烈的争论。多数的意见是：妇女要解放非外出参加工作不可。后来一个工属提出不同意见，她说：“我们有四个孩子，我每天作六个人的饭，带四个孩子，我虽然没参加工作，可是在家里劳动也是一样，我也不受气。”经过她的说明，大家对妇女解放问题有了较为全面的认识。九街在讨论男女平等时，不少人还觉得妇女用处不大，女不如男。寡妇王淑珍用自己的生动事实教育了大家。她说：“我结婚后，生了第一个闺女，公婆还不觉怎样，第二个又生了个闺女，这就挨了婆婆的骂，说我没出息，从这就断不了受气；以后又生两个孩子，都是闺女，连公公也骂我了。可是解放以后，闺女小子一样，我三个大些的女儿全在铁路上工作，一样地为国家服务，每月挣的钱我是吃不完用不尽。四闺女正念书，将来也能工作。谁说女的不行我也不赞成。”她的话，给了重男轻女的思想以严重打击。
