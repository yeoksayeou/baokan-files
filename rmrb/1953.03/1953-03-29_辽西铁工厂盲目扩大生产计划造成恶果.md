    Liaoxi Provincial State-Owned Liaoxi Iron Factory's leading cadres, eager for quick success and blinded by conceit, failed to conduct practical investigations into actual needs, failed to consider their subjective capabilities, and failed to mobilize the masses of workers, thereby blindly formulating the 1953 annual production plan. Now, the sales of most products and the production tasks for January and February have fallen through.
    At the end of 1952, the factory signed a contract with Liaoxi and Rehe provinces to produce two thousand waterwheels, stipulating that they should be delivered in monthly installments before April 5th this year to meet the drought resistance needs of farmers in the two provinces. After signing the contract, the factory "heard" that the Liaoxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau wanted to order two thousand waterwheels, and the Industrial Materials Company wanted to order ten thousand. Thus, without verifying whether this was true, they decided to produce 14,000 waterwheels throughout 1953. The factory's equipment and manpower at the time could not complete such a large task; however, the factory director Yang Jimin believed that since the country had entered large-scale construction, this problem could be solved. Therefore, he formulated a basic construction plan to increase various equipment exceeding 18.5% of the total value of existing fixed assets and reported it to the Provincial Department of Industry. Subsequently, he sent people to visit the Shanxi Machinery Factory, which produces waterwheels year-round, mechanically copying the experience of the Shanxi Machinery Factory. Based on the man-hours used per waterwheel during the factory's most efficient production period, he changed the quota of 37 man-hours required to manufacture a waterwheel in 1952 to 23 man-hours. According to this quota, the initial draft of the 1953 plan was compiled, announced to all employees at the model worker award ceremony at the end of 1952, and the slogan "Oppose Conservatism" was put forward to encourage workers to discuss it. The workers, fearing that the leadership would accuse them of being "conservative," unanimously approved the plan and expressed their "attitude." For example, Li Zongyan, a worker from the Second Workshop, said on stage: "We guarantee to complete the production plan. We guarantee to increase the speed of the machines in our workshop from 300 revolutions per minute to 1,300 revolutions per minute." However, there were no specific measures on how to increase it. In this situation, the leading cadres were satisfied that there were no problems, affirmed the plan, and reported it to the Department of Industry. The head of the planning section of the Provincial Department of Industry blindly considered this plan to be very "advanced," only asked the factory director Yang Jimin by telephone "whether it could be completed," and when Yang Jimin said, "Yes!" he approved the plan. Now the facts show the blindness of this plan: the Provincial Industrial Materials Company actually only ordered 500 waterwheels, and there are 9,500 waterwheels that are not sold in the annual production task.
    Because the plan was formulated blindly, all indicators lacked accurate basis, and as a result, even the parts that could be completed according to existing capabilities were not completed. For example, the man-hour quota indicator was calculated based on the figures achieved during the Red May competition last year. The workers said: "The production at that time was like a gust of wind, very strong, but the product quality was very poor. The rejects now are better than the first-class products at that time." It can be seen that this basis is extremely unreliable, so this year's actual man-hour quota is still higher than last year's, and the machine is still running at 300 revolutions per minute. In the past, the factory used manual labor to anneal the waterwheel chain links, which was slow and tiring. The workers used old foreign nail machines to modify them into annealing machines. After the modification, they did not study whether it was successful, and the leadership set a quota of 10,000 rings annealed per day by twelve people. When formal production began this year, it was found that the annealed rings were of different sizes, not shaped, and did not match the chain wheel, so manual labor was used again, and twelve people only annealed 3,600 rings per day.
    On February 15th, factory director Yang Jimin saw that the production plan had failed and the production tasks were urgent, and he became somewhat impatient. Only then did he convene all the workers to re-discuss the production plan for the first quarter. At this time, the workers raised four major difficulties: "Insufficient electricity, insufficient machines, insufficient manpower, and insufficient factory buildings." The factory director could not solve them, and the upper and lower levels lost confidence, and the entire factory fell into chaos. The Provincial Department of Industry hurriedly transferred machines to them from Siping and mechanical factories in the city, organized external factories to process parts, requested the Electric Power Bureau to allocate more electricity, and changed two-shift production to three-shift production. The administrative cadres in the factory also went to the workshops to participate in production, and the personnel section chief and security section chief also helped anneal the chains. Due to the urgency of the task, safety education was relaxed, and accidents occurred, and one worker had his thumb chopped off by a machine. Now the factory is in a chaotic state, and it is stepping up the rush.

    辽西铁工厂盲目扩大生产计划造成恶果
    辽西省地方国营辽西铁工厂领导干部好大喜功，不切实调查实际需要，不计算主观能力，又不发动职工群众，即盲目地制订了一九五三年的全年生产计划。现在大部产品的销路和一、二两月的生产任务都已落空。
    该厂于一九五二年末与辽西、热河两省签订合同，承制两千台水车，规定于今年四月五日前按月分期交货，以满足两省农民抗旱的需要。签订合同之后，该厂又“听说”辽西省水利局要订两千台水车，工业器材公司也要订一万台，于是，也没有去了解是否真实，就确定一九五三年全年生产水车一万四千台。该厂当时的设备和人力都不能完成这样大的任务；但该厂厂长杨济民认为：国家已经进入大规模建设，这个问题是可以解决的。于是他就制订了一个大于现有固定资产总值百分之十八点五的增加各项设备的基本建设计划，报到省政府工业厅。随后又派人到常年生产水车的山西机械厂去参观，机械地把山西机械厂的经验搬来，再根据本厂生产效率最高时期每台水车耗用工时数，就把一九五二年制造一台水车需三十七个工时的定额改为二十三个工时。依照这个定额就把一九五三年计划初步编制了出来，在一九五二年末奖励模范大会上向全体职工宣布，并提出“反对保守”的口号，要职工讨论。职工怕领导上说自己“保守”，就一声雷地通过了这一计划，并表示了“态度”。如第二车间工人李宗衍上台说：“保证完成生产计划，我们车间的机器由一分钟三百转保证提高到一千三百转。”但是怎样提高，却没有具体措施。在这种情况下，领导干部就心满意足地认为没有问题了，就把计划肯定下来，报到工业厅。省府工业厅计划科科长盲目地认为这个计划很“先进”，只在电话中问该厂厂长杨济民“能否完成”，听杨济民说：“能！”就把计划批准了。现在事实说明了这个计划的盲目性：省工业器材公司实际只订五百台水车，全年生产任务规定要生产的水车就有九千五百台没有销路。
    由于计划是盲目制订出来的，各项指标都缺乏确切的根据，结果按现有能力可以完成的部分也没有完成。如工时定额指标是按照去年红五月竞赛时达到的数字推算的，工人讲：“那时的生产像一阵风，劲挺猛，产品质量却很坏，现在的废品都比那时的一等品强。”可见这个根据极不可靠，所以今年的实际工时定额仍然比去年高，机器每分钟仍然是三百转。该厂过去煨水车练子环用手工，既慢又累，工人就利用旧洋钉机改装成煨环机，改完亦未研究是否成功，领导上就定出了十二个人每天煨一万个环的定额。今年正式生产时发现，煨的环大小不一，不成型，与练子轮不吻合，又改用手工，十二个人每天只煨出三千六百个。
    到了二月十五日，厂长杨济民看到生产计划落空，生产任务紧迫，有些沉不住气，才召集全厂工人重新讨论第一季度生产计划。这时工人提出了“电力不足、机器不足、人力不足、厂房不足”四大困难，厂长无法解决，上下失去了信心，全厂陷于混乱。省工业厅，赶忙由四平及市内机械厂给他们调机器，组织外厂加工部件；请求电业局增拨电力，将二班生产改为三班生产。厂内的行政干部也下到车间参加生产，人事股长、保卫股长也帮助煨练子。由于任务紧迫，放松了保安教育，事故随之发生，已有一个工人被机器剁去了大拇指。现在厂内忙乱一团，正加紧突击。
