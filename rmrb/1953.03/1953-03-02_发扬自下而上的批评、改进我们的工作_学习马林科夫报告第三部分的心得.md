Promote Bottom-Up Criticism and Improve Our Work
    -- Reflections on Studying Part Three of Malenkov's Report
    Nie Tiejun
Editor's note: The author of this article is a staff member of the North China District Company of the China Coal Construction Company. Based on the spirit of Part Three of Malenkov's report, he links it with reality and criticizes the shortcomings in his own agency. This is not only helpful for the leading cadres of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company's North China District Company to absorb bottom-up opinions and examine their work, but also has reference value for cadres and the broad masses of readers in other enterprise departments. The China Coal Industry Building Materials Company's North China District Company should be responsible for replying to the facts criticized in this article immediately.

    In Part Three of the summary report of Comrade Malenkov's work in the Central Committee of the CPSU—"The Labor Party," he summarized the great achievements made by the CPSU in the twelve years since the 18th Congress and also criticized some shortcomings existing in certain party organizations. These shortcomings are not unique to some units in our China. Seriously exposing these shortcomings, awakening the comrades who have made mistakes, and thus improving the shortcomings will be of great significance in advancing our cause. Here, I will only use some examples from the North China District Company of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company (hereinafter referred to as the North China District Company) for explanation.
    (I)
    Self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, as the main method of exposing and correcting errors and shortcomings, has not been fully developed in the company.
    The fact is, as Comrade Malenkov pointed out, victory has made some leading cadres of the company complacent and unwilling to accept opinions from below, unwilling to trouble themselves with the work of exposing shortcomings and errors. In the four years since liberation, except for the "Three-Anti" movement in the first half of 1952 and the anti-bureaucracy movement in the second half of the year, leading cadres have never seriously examined their shortcomings in front of the masses, let alone organized and mobilized the masses to criticize their shortcomings. Even in the "Three-Anti" movement and the anti-bureaucracy movement, the leaders' self-criticism was not profound or thorough enough, and the opinions raised by the masses were still not well valued and resolved. For example, in the anti-bureaucracy movement, employees proposed that the Beijing Coal Industry Building Materials Company should not be rewarded for falsely reporting achievements in the third quarter, and criticized the seriousness of the North China District Company's mistake of not seriously handling the matter after discovering this error but instead covering up the truth, and demanded that leading cadres conduct a profound examination and publicly self-criticize in the Party newspaper. However, such an important issue was actually omitted in the summary report of the anti-bureaucracy movement. Obviously, the leading cadres of the company are still afraid or unwilling to face this mistake. As a result, a similar situation occurred again at the end of the fourth quarter of 1952. The Tangshan Branch Company of Hebei Province under the company added 165,000 tons of coal futures contracts that should not have been included in sales to its annual sales target. In order to make up for the inventory deficit caused by false "sales," it also made a large false "transfer," so the entire North China District Company was calculated to have completed the annual coal sales plan by a figure exceeding one percent. This figure has been reported level by level to the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government. Later, after the statistics section of the North China District Company sent someone to Tangshan to check, it was discovered that the figure was false and was corrected. The North China District Company only completed over 99 percent of its annual coal sales plan.
    According to the manager and planning section chief of the Tangshan Branch Company, they were originally unwilling to do this because Zhou Tonglin, the deputy manager of the Hebei Provincial Company, and Song Guangwei, the deputy section chief of the Coal Industry Section of the North China District Company, told them to do this and exerted pressure, so they had no choice. Although this shows that the leading cadres of the Tangshan Branch Company lacked strong principles and did not dare to wage a resolute struggle against tendencies that violated Party and state discipline, it also shows that this is the direct consequence of the North China District Company's bureaucratic attitude toward criticism.
    Because the leadership does not value and adopt bottom-up criticism and opinions, the democratic atmosphere in the agency is very weak. If the masses have opinions, they dare not raise them directly, and they discuss them behind their backs. Instead of seriously examining the reasons for this situation, leading cadres simply believe that the masses are ideologically backward and blame the masses for not raising their opinions face to face, but running behind their backs to complain and say strange things.
    Some meetings have also become a formality, routinely praising some achievements, making some unprincipled flattery, and then superficially mentioning some unimportant shortcomings. However, this is only mentioned verbally and there is no preparation to improve in action. This further aggravates the leaders' complacent mood.
    The agency also established a system of life criticism meetings, but the content of these criticism meetings is only general criticism and self-criticism from ordinary comrades, without criticism of the leadership's shortcomings; some departments do not hold a life criticism meeting for half a year and the leadership does not care; meetings mostly examine some minor details of life and problems that are not related to principles, and these are all superficial phenomena, such as being late for work, not taking the initiative in work, etc. There is neither an ideological examination and analysis, nor is there criticism of a certain incorrect ideology, so there is very little improvement, making the criticism meeting a formality and vulgarizing self-criticism.
    How can we develop criticism, especially bottom-up criticism? Comrade Malenkov tells us: "It is wrong to think that bottom-up criticism can be developed automatically in a spontaneous manner." He pointed out: "Only when everyone who makes healthy criticism can be sure that he can get the support of our organization, and be sure that the shortcomings he points out will be truly eliminated, can bottom-up criticism be developed and expanded."
    The facts fully prove the correctness of Comrade Malenkov's report. When the company's past leading cadres did not accept criticism from below, or emphasized that the criticism was not comprehensive enough and therefore did not accept even the correct parts, the company's democratic and political atmosphere was very thin and criticism could not be developed; when the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently set up an opinion box in the company to support criticism and indeed solved some problems, when the People's Daily published manuscripts criticizing the company for not rewarding units that falsely reported achievements and for covering up mistakes, and expressed support in the editor's note, thus prompting the company's leading cadres to pay attention, the employees' morale was very high. People who did not dare to criticize in the past now dare to raise criticisms directly, and some have submitted their opinions in the opinion box set up by the Municipal Committee of the Industry and Commerce. This fully proves that Comrade Malenkov is correct, and not the leaders who simply believe that the employees are ideologically "backward." They do not understand how important it is to develop bottom-up criticism for eliminating errors and shortcomings in work, and therefore cannot understand the importance of Comrade Malenkov's teachings: "The more people we absorb in eliminating shortcomings in our work, the stronger the bottom-up supervision of the activities of all our organizations, the smoother our work will be in various fields."
    (II)
    The work of correctly selecting talents and seriously checking the implementation situation has not been done well in the North China District Company.
    The North China District Company has formulated many internal systems and issued many decisions and instructions to its subordinate units, but the various units under the company generally reflect that the North China District Company does not solve problems. Why is this? It is precisely because leading cadres rely on signing documents to lead enterprises. They do not understand the actual situation below, so the documents they issue are often not specific. For example, the head office issues a work instruction every quarter, and the North China District Company also issues one in the same way, but the content is the same, only the parts that are not related to the North China District are deleted, without pointing out specific ways to implement the head office's instructions in light of the specific circumstances in the district, resulting in the inability to implement them below. For example, the company instructed below not to work overtime to avoid affecting the health of employees, which of course is very correct. However, the bottom level simply cannot implement it due to the small number of people and the large amount of work. They sell coal from morning to night every day, and work as usual on Sundays and holidays. Not only is there no time to study, but there is no time to rest, and there is no overtime pay for overtime work. The company has not paid attention to and solved this problem. It issues instructions and then ignores them, without asking how they are being implemented. For example, the North China Competition Committee issued a circular requiring attention to workers' safety and welfare during the competition. The company's leading cadres did not take effective measures based on this instruction, resulting in continuous work-related injuries and deaths of porters and loaders in its subordinate units. The People's Daily, Workers' Daily, and Tangshan Labor Daily have repeatedly published articles criticizing this, but it has not been improved so far.
    The second shortcoming in checking the implementation is that the situation of reporting good news but not bad news still exists. The issue of Beijing Company falsely reporting achievements mentioned above is a good example. After the statistics section discovered it, it prepared to issue a circular, but the leading cadres were unwilling to make this mistake public and covered up the truth. In addition, when summarizing work, they mostly emphasize achievements and list many objective reasons for failing to complete the task, instead of "first exposing shortcomings and illegal acts," as Comrade Malenkov pointed out. Therefore, the work summary has become a routine and cannot play a role in guiding and promoting work.
    We know that after the principles and policies are determined, cadres determine everything. Therefore, if cadres are not correctly selected and used, the tasks of the Party and the state cannot be completed smoothly.
    However, in the North China District Company, the political quality and professional ability of cadres are not the only criteria for selecting and promoting cadres. As Comrade Malenkov pointed out: "Some honest and knowledgeable workers, because they are unwilling to tolerate shortcomings, make the leadership uncomfortable, and as a result, they are squeezed out under various excuses, and replaced by people of questionable quality or completely incompetent, but who are considered docile and pleasing by some leaders." For example, among the people trusted by the leading cadres in the company, two people worked in the company's most confidential department—the business office, one also held a responsible position, and also served as the branch secretary of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the organization member of the trade union. However, one of these two people was a special agent of the reactionary Youth Party, who had twelve murder cases in Yutian County, Hebei Province alone, and the other was a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League who refused to confess. Both of them have been arrested in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. In addition, of course, there are some other examples, which I will not list here.
    Secondly, the selection of cadres is sometimes based on resumes and certificates, but their political quality and professional ability have not been seriously reviewed. There is such a fact: the company has a cadre who graduated from the Department of Architecture of a university, claiming to be very knowledgeable about basic construction work. The leadership did not seriously review it and promoted him from clerk to staff member; as a result, this university graduate staff member is not as good as an ordinary clerk and trainee. After coming to the company for a year and a half, he cannot even complete the drawing of a simple chart and the drafting of ordinary official documents, let alone other things.
    Again, the promotion of cadres is not combined with education and improvement, which results in these promoted cadres, especially the cadres of the personnel department, trade union, and Communist Youth League, thinking that they are different from others and trusted by the leadership, so they become arrogant and detached from the masses, which makes the work of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League, and even the cultural and entertainment work in the agency, done by a few people. Because they do not get the support of the masses, the work is not done well; other cadres, in addition to general administrative work, have no work to do. For example, in communications and reporting, the North China District Company also has a communications team leader, but for several years, he has not seen him write an article for the newspaper, nor has he developed correspondents, let alone encouraged everyone to write articles. However, there are many comrades in the company who are willing to engage in communications work and have also put forward opinions to the leadership on developing communications work, but they have not received support; even the People's Daily wrote to a comrade in the company, asking him to report on the company's service to basic construction, but the communications team leader still does not give support, so except for a few comrades who spontaneously write articles and reflect the situation to the newspaper, the company's communications work has never been developed.
    There is no need to list more examples. From these facts, it can be shown that the North China District Company's work on correctly selecting talents and checking the implementation situation is not done well, or rather, done very badly.
    (III)
    Why do the above phenomena occur? I think the fundamental reason is that the leading cadres of the company underestimate the importance of ideological work, making this work almost unattended. As Comrade Malenkov said: "Underestimating the importance of ideological work is to a large extent the result of some of our leading cadres not striving to improve their awareness, enrich their knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, and draw on the historical experience of the Party."
    First of all, in terms of learning, the leading cadres are not active and attentive enough, often taking up time for theoretical study to study business issues. Judging only from the results of theoretical and current affairs tests, the average number of those who fail is almost half of the cadres above the section chief level: a Party member section chief did not even know what the "three evils" that invaded the revolutionary camp were in a test just after the end of the "Three-Anti" movement; and a Party member section chief answered the general line of land reform as "neutralizing landlords." It can be seen from this the seriousness of neglecting political tendencies.
    In the leadership of ideological work, the company originally determined that the director of the personnel office was responsible, but he was busy with Party affairs work all day long, and the masses could not even see him; later, it was determined that the manager was responsible, but it was not improved. Instead of preventing or resolving an incorrect idea of a cadre when it is just budding or not serious, the company allows it to develop and spread, and only conducts individual talks when it becomes very serious, rigidly telling some revolutionary principles in an injection-style method; instead of truly caring about the actual difficulties of employees and solving some problems that can be solved, it abstractly emphasizes that personal problems are not allowed to be considered; for a cadre who is ideologically backward but also has some strengths, instead of criticizing the backward factors in his thinking and at the same time affirming his strengths and encouraging him to move towards progress, the company takes an attitude of letting go and ignoring him and denying him altogether; the Communist Youth League does not take the attitude of widely uniting and strengthening education for young employees, but unites this part of people and excludes that part of people, forming small circles; the trade union does not accept every employee who meets the conditions for membership in accordance with the Trade Union Law and the regulations of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, but closes some people who can join the union according to the regulations but have certain shortcomings outside the door, and does not unite and educate them.
    What is the result of doing this? As Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his report: "Any weakening of the influence of socialist ideology is an increase in the influence of bourgeois ideology." Some cadres who could have made progress have become backward, and those who were originally more backward have become even more backward. The problem is so obvious.
    How to help comrades continue to progress? This is a question worth studying. The experience of the branch of the Seventh and Second Fourth Factory of the Communist Party of China in educating workers with backward ideas (carried in the third edition of the People's Daily on January 13) is worth our attention. The reason why worker Sun Shunji was able to move from backwardness to progress is because the workshop Party branch was able to grasp the key to his ideological problems, help him solve his actual difficulties, praise his every small progress, and use methods of enlightenment and guidance to make him realize his mistakes and truly appreciate the Party's concern and care for him, thereby improving his class consciousness and enhancing his sense of ownership of the country.
    This shows that if we want to do a good job in ideological work, we must understand and be familiar with the ideological situation of the masses. To understand and be familiar with the ideological situation of the masses, leading cadres must care about the lives of the masses and maintain close contact with the masses.
    Comrade Malenkov emphasized: "Ideological work is the primary responsibility of the Party, and neglecting this work may cause irreparable losses to the interests of the Party and the state." The facts of the North China District Company fully prove this point.

    发扬自下而上的批评、改进我们的工作
    ——学习马林科夫报告第三部分的心得
    聂铁钧
    编者按：这篇文章的作者是中国煤建公司华北区公司的科员，他依据马林科夫报告第三部分的精神，联系实际，针对自己机关中的缺点提出批评，这不仅对于中国煤业建筑器材公司华北区公司的领导干部吸取自下而上的意见、检查工作有帮助，而且对于其他企业部门的干部和广大读者也有参考的价值。这篇文章中所批评的事实，中国煤业建筑器材公司华北区公司应即负责答复。
    马林科夫同志在联共中央工作的总结报告的第三部分—“工党”，概括地总结了联共自第十八次代表大会以来十二年中所获得的巨大成就，同时也批评了某些党组织中存在的一些缺点。这些缺点在我们中国某些单位来说，也不是绝无仅有的。认真地揭发这些缺点，使犯错误的同志惊醒过来，从而改进缺点，对推进我们的事业，将会有着重大的意义。这里仅从中国煤业建筑器材公司华北区公司（以下简称华北区公司）的一些例子来作说明。
    （一）
    自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，作为揭露、改正错误与缺点的主要方法，还没有在公司充分地展开。
    事实正如马林科夫同志指出的，胜利已使得该公司一部分领导干部产生了骄傲自满的情绪，他们不愿接受来自下面的意见，不愿拿揭发缺点与错误的工作来麻烦自己。解放四年来，除了一九五二年上半年的“三反”运动及下半年的反官僚主义运动以外，领导干部就从没有一次在群众面前认真检查过自己的缺点，更谈不到组织与发动群众来批评自己的缺点了。就是在“三反”运动及反官僚主义运动中，领导者的检讨也是不深刻、不彻底的，对群众提出的意见仍然没有很好地加以重视与解决。如在反官僚主义运动中，职工提出在第三季度不应奖励虚报成绩的北京市煤业建筑器材公司，并批判了华北区公司在发觉这个错误后不认真处理反而遮盖事实真相的错误的严重性，要求领导干部深刻检查，并在党报上公开检讨。但这样一个重要的问题，在反官僚主义总结报告中居然被遗漏了。显然，该公司领导干部还不敢或不愿正视这个错误。结果在一九五二年第四季末又发生了类似的情况。该公司所属河北省的唐山支公司在全年销售任务中加进去不应列入销售的期货合同十六万五千吨煤炭，为了弥补因假“销售”而产生的库存赤字，又作了很大一笔假“调入”，因而整个华北区公司也算以超过百分之一强的数字完成了全年煤炭销售计划。这个数字已逐级上报到中央人民政府商业部。后经华北区公司统计科派人到唐山去检查，发觉这个数字是假的，才予以纠正，华北区公司全年煤炭销售计划也只完成了百分之九九强。
    据唐山支公司经理及计划股长反映，他们本来不愿意这样作的，因为河北省公司副经理周桐林及华北区公司煤业科副科长宋光伟叫他们这样作，并施用压力，他们没有办法。这虽然说明唐山支公司领导干部原则性不强，不敢同违反党与国家纪律的倾向作坚决的斗争，同时也说明正是华北区公司以官僚主义态度对待批评的直接后果。
    由于领导上不重视与不采纳自下而上的批评及意见，机关内民主空气非常薄弱，群众有意见也不敢正面提出，在背后议论纷纷。领导干部不认真地去检查造成这种情况的原因何在，而单纯地认为群众思想落后，责备群众为什么有意见不当面提，跑在背后发牢骚、说怪话。
    在一些会议上也变成一种形式，照例歌颂一些成绩，作些无原则的捧场，然后浮皮擦痒地提到一些不关紧要的缺点，而这也只是在口头提提，并没有准备在行动上加以改进，这就更加重了领导者沾沾自喜的情绪。
    机关里也订了生活检讨会制度，但这个检讨会的内容只是一般同志的批评与自我批评，没有对领导上缺点的批评；有的部门半年不开一次生活检讨会领导上也不过问；开会的多检查一些生活小节及不关系原则的问题，而且都是一些表面现象，如上班迟到、工作不主动等等，既没有从思想意识上来检查分析，也没有针对某一种不正确思想进行批判，因而改进也很少，使检讨会流于形式，把自我批评庸俗化。
    怎样才能开展批评，特别是自下而上的批评呢？马林科夫同志告诉我们：“以为自下而上的批评能够以自流的方式自动展开的看法，是错误的。”他指出：“只有在每一个提出健康的批评的人能够确实知道他可以得到我们组织的支持，确实知道他所指出的缺点会真正予以消除的时候，自下而上的批评才能展开和扩大。”
    事实完全证明了马林科夫同志报告的正确性。当该公司过去领导干部不接受从下面来的批评，或者强调批评中有不够全面的地方因而连其中正确部分也不接受的时候，该公司的民主与政治空气就很稀薄，批评就展不开；当最近中国共产党天津市工商委员会在该公司设置意见箱，支持批评，并确实解决了一些问题的时候，当人民日报刊载了批评该公司不应奖励虚报成绩的单位及掩饰错误的稿件，并在编者按语中表示支持，因而促使该公司领导干部重视的时候，职工情绪就很高涨。过去不敢批评的人现在也敢正面提出批评了，有的已在市工商党委设置的意见箱中投入了自己的意见。这就充分证明正确的正是马林科夫同志，而不是单纯地认为职工思想“落后”的领导者们，他们不理解展开自下而上的批评，对于消灭工作中的错误和缺点是何等重要，因而也就不能理解马林科夫同志所教导我们的“在消灭我们工作中的缺点时吸收的群众越多，对我们一切组织的活动的自下而上的监督越强，我们在各种领域的工作就越顺利”的这一段话的重要意义。
    （二）
    正确地挑选人材和认真地检查执行情形的工作，在华北区公司也没有很好地进行。
    华北区公司订了不少机关内的制度，对所属各单位也发了许多决定与指示，但该公司所属各单位却普遍反映华北区公司不解决问题。为什么这样呢？就正因为领导干部是依靠着签署公文来领导企业的。他们不了解下面的实际情况，因此发出的文件多不具体。举例来说吧，总公司每季度发出一个工作指示，华北区公司也照样发一个，但内容相同，仅仅把不关系华北区的部分删去了，而没有针对区内的具体情况，指出贯彻总公司指示的具体作法，结果使下面无法执行。如该公司指示下面不准加班加点，以免影响职工身体健康，这当然是很对的。可是下面因人少事多根本无法执行，每天从早到晚卖煤，星期日及例假也照常工作，不但没有学习时间，连休息时间都没有，而且加班也没有加班费。该公司就没有重视与解决这个问题，指示发下去就不管了，也不问执行得如何。又如华北竞赛委员会曾发出通报，要求在竞赛期间重视工人的安全福利问题。该公司领导干部没有根据这一指示来采取有效措施，致所属各单位不断发生搬运装卸工人的工伤、死亡事故。人民日报、工人日报、唐山劳动报曾一再发表稿件批评，但至今仍未获得改善。
    在检查执行上的第二个缺点是报喜不报忧的情形仍然存在。上面提到北京市公司虚报成绩问题就是一个很好的例子。统计科发觉后准备予以通报，但领导干部不愿公开这个错误，把事实真相遮盖起来。此外，在总结工作时，多是强调成绩，完不成任务则列举许多客观原因，而不是如马林科夫同志所指出的“首先是揭发缺点，揭露非法行为”，因此工作总结也就成为例行公事，起不了指导与推动工作的作用。
    我们知道，方针政策确定后，干部就决定一切。因此，如果不正确地挑选和使用干部，就不能顺利地完成党和国家的任务。
    然而在华北区公司并不是完全根据干部的政治品质和业务能力作为选择与提拔干部的标准。正如马林科夫同志指出的：“一些正直的、通晓业务的工作人员，因他们对缺点不肯容忍而使领导上感到不舒服，结果便在各种借口下被排挤出去，而代之以品质可疑、或者完全不称职、但被一些领导者认为随和可喜的人。”举例说吧，在该公司领导干部相信的人中，有两个人在公司最机密的部门——业务室工作，一个还担任负责的职务，并兼任中苏友好协会的支会干事及工会的组织委员。然而这两个人一个是反动青年党的特务，仅在河北省玉田县就有十二条命案，一个是三青团分子拒未交代。在镇压反革命运动中两人都已被逮捕了。此外，当然还有一些例子，这里就不再多举了。
    其次，是挑选干部有时是根据履历表和证明文件，而并没有认真地审查他们的政治品质和业务能力。有这样一个事实：该公司有一个大学建筑系毕业的干部，自称对基本建设工作很内行，领导上没有认真审查就将他由办事员提升为科员；结果这个大学毕业的科员还不如一个普通的办事员及练习生，来到公司一年半了，连一张简单图表的绘制及普通公文的草拟都不能胜任，更谈不上其他了。
    再次，对干部的提拔不是与教育、提高相结合，结果就使得这些被提拔的干部，尤其是人事部门、工会与团的干部认为自己与众不同，有领导上相信，因而自高自大，脱离群众，致使党、政、工、团的工作，甚至连机关里的文化娱乐工作都是少数几个人在作，因得不到群众的支持，工作没有作好；其他的干部除了行政上一般的工作外，却没有工作可作。例如通讯报道工作，华北区公司也有一个通讯组长，然而几年来没有看见他给报社写过一篇稿子，也没发展过通讯员，更谈不到鼓励大家写稿了。而该公司内却有不少同志愿意搞通讯工作，也向领导上提过开展通讯工作的意见，但得不到支持；甚至人民日报社写信给该公司的一个同志，要他报道该公司为基本建设服务的稿件，但通讯组长仍不给予支持，因此除了少数同志自发地向报社写稿及反映情况以外，该公司通讯工作始终未开展起来。
    用不着列举更多的例子了，由这些事实就可以说明华北区公司关于正确地挑选人才和检查执行情形作得很不好，或者说作得很坏。
    （三）
    为什么会产生上述现象呢？我觉得根本的原因是该公司领导干部低估了思想工作的重要性。使这种工作处于几乎无人照顾的状态。正如马林科夫同志所说：“低估思想工作的重要性在很大程度上是我们一部分领导干部没有努力提高自己的觉悟、充实马克思列宁主义的知识和吸取党的历史经验的结果。”
    首先在学习上，领导干部表现得不够积极和重视，经常占用理论学习时间来研究业务问题。仅从理论、时事测验成绩来看，不及格者平均差不多占科长以上干部的半数：有一个党员科长在“三反”运动刚结束的一次测验中，竟不知道侵入革命阵营的
    “三害”是什么；更有一个党员科长把土地改革的总路线答成“中立地主”。从此可以看出忽视政治倾向的严重。
    在思想工作的领导上，该公司原来确定由人事室主任负责，然而他成天忙于党务工作，群众连面都见不着；以后确定由经理负责，也未获得改进。该公司不是在一个干部不正确的思想正在萌芽或者尚不严重时就去预防或解决，而是听任其发展蔓延，
    一直到了非常严重的时候才找来进行个别谈话，用注入式的方法生硬地讲一些革命大道理；不是真正关心职工的实际困难，解决一些可能解决的问题，而是抽象地强调个人问题不准考虑；对于一个思想比较落后但也有若干长处的干部，不是批判他思想中的落后因素，又同时肯定他的优点，鼓励他走向进步，而是采取放任不管、一概否定的态度；青年团对于青年职工不是采取广泛团结、加强教育的态度，而是团结这一部分人，排斥那一部分人，形成小圈子；工会不是根据工会法及全国总工会的规定接受每一个合乎入会条件的职工入会，而是把一些按章可以入会但有某些缺点的关在大门以外，也不予团结和教育。
    这样作的结果怎样呢？正如马林科夫同志在报告中指出的：“社会主义思想影响的任何削弱，都是资产阶级思想影响的增强。”本来有一些可以进步的干部也变得落后了，原来就比较落后的就更加落后下去。问题就是这样明显。
    如何帮助同志们不断进步呢？这是一个很值得研究的问题。中共七二四工厂一车间支部教育有落后思想的工人的经验（载人民日报一月十三日第三版）值得我们注意。该厂工人孙顺吉之所以能够由落后走向进步，就是因为车间党支部能够掌握他思想问题的关键，帮助解决了他的实际困难，表扬他每一个小小的进步，用启发诱导的方法使他认识到自己的错误，并真正体会到党对自己的关心和体贴，从而提高了阶级觉悟，增强了国家主人翁的感觉。
    这就说明了要想作好思想工作，必须了解与熟悉群众的思想情况。要想了解与熟悉群众的思想情况，领导干部就必须关心群众的生活，与群众保持密切的联系。
    马林科夫同志强调指出：“思想工作是党的首要职责，不重视这种工作就可能给党和国家的利益造成无法弥补的损失。”华北区公司的事实充分地证明了这一点。
