    More than 300 cadres at the Benxi Coal Mine studied Malenkov's report from late November of last year to February 10th of this year. This study yielded great results, and everyone felt it was of great practical help to their current work and thinking.

    First, the study enabled cadres to have a clear understanding of the current international situation, clarified the confused thinking of some cadres, broadened their horizons, and made everyone understand that the effectiveness of their work is closely linked to the task of defending peace, thereby enhancing their enthusiasm for work. Everyone generally reflected: Doing our work well is increasing the strength of peace. They also gained a further understanding of the essence of the Soviet Union's peace policy and the world people's movement to defend peace.

    Secondly, they gained a further understanding of the world significance of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan. In particular, they more accurately and concretely realized that "the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow," and many comrades reflected: "It's as if we have personally seen communist society." Because this study was a rich communist education for the cadres, everyone organically combined the study with their own work, using a comparative method to examine their work in light of reality. Everyone recognized that the shortcomings pointed out by Malenkov not only existed in large quantities in the Benxi Coal Mine, but their severity was even greater than what Comrade Malenkov pointed out. For example: (1) Because some cadres did not sufficiently understand that increasing labor productivity is an important condition for transforming socialist production, the coal mine had 2,900 horsepower (only counting those above 50 horsepower) of mechanical equipment, enough for two Niuxintai Coal Mines (annual output of more than 300,000 tons), but its utilization rate was wasted. One blower originally required only 10 horsepower, but now uses 125 horsepower, wasting more than 70 million RMB annually. Such a serious problem had not been noticed at all in the past. (2) The completion of the plan was unbalanced. Last year, the overall production target of the entire mine was completed according to the plan, but the large working faces did not complete the plan, while the small working faces overfulfilled the plan, but the quality was poor. In particular, there were serious problems in formulating and implementing the plan. The planning department lacked an understanding of the actual situation, only grasping the numbers. Whenever making a plan, engineers, pit leaders, and technicians did not study the plan well, but instead "bargained," causing losses to the work. (3) There were several problems in promoting advanced experience, such as the Soviet Union's advanced experience and advanced operating methods such as "large roof falls," "water drilling," and "coal cutting machines," which could not be promoted due to the conservative thinking of the technical leaders. As the mine director said in his self-criticism: "These problems were not completely unknown in the past, but after this study, we have a greater understanding of them and have found the key to solving them." Thirdly, in studying the third part of Malenkov's report, everyone used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to launch a bottom-up inspection, criticizing the conservative views and fear of taking responsibility of the technical personnel, improving the relationship between the technical personnel, and putting forward 119 constructive opinions on how to improve technical issues. The mine leadership also conducted self-criticism, examining the erroneous thinking of not paying attention to the promotion of the advanced experience of Qu Fuming, a national labor model, in the past. From studying Malenkov's report, they further studied how to improve labor productivity. The fundamental method must be to improve labor organization, strengthen democratic management, promote advanced experience, tap potential strengths, and strengthen the ideological education of technical personnel. For example, in terms of improving labor organization, the previously dispersed maintenance forces have been initially concentrated, and the work efficiency of one and a half months will be equal to the work efficiency of the past year. As long as we continue to improve, we will have the conditions to implement rapid maintenance methods in the future. In terms of promoting advanced experience, it is planned to use the method of rotational training classes for promotion. In particular, attention has been paid to the ideological education of cadres, especially technical personnel. Mine Director Tian Datian said: "The problems existing in the coal mine are not only that the technical potential has not been tapped, but more importantly, the 'ideological potential' of the cadres has not been tapped." In addition, attention is currently being paid to correcting the production bias of "loose in the front and tight in the back" and the uneven production of each "working face." Mine Director Tian said: "We have been engaged in industry for several years, but we have not found the way. After this study, we have found the way to engage in industry."

    The Benxi Coal Mine cadres' study was successful because, in addition to the leadership's attention, proper arrangements of time, the establishment of practical and feasible systems, and the planned and guided regulation of the study progress, the organization of central study groups and the strengthening of the leadership of the central study groups played a great role in consolidating and promoting the study of general cadres. The Benxi Coal Mine leadership formed a central study group of 20 people, including all the party, government, labor union, and youth league members of the mine, as well as the main section chiefs and engineers. The central group was divided into three subgroups, with the secretary of the Party committee and the mine director serving as the group leaders. These comrades studied one step ahead of the other comrades, and then respectively guided the study of each section and share, answered their questions, and guided the discussion. This drove the study of the general cadres and pushed the study to a climax, achieving good results.

    本溪煤矿干部
    学习马林科夫报告检查工作中的缺点
    本溪煤矿三百余干部，从去年十一月下旬到今年二月十日学习了马林科夫报告。这次学习收获很大，大家都感到对当前工作及思想有很大的实际帮助。
    这次学习，第一、使干部对目前国际形势有了明确的认识，澄清了某些干部的糊涂思想，扩大了眼界，使每个人都理解到自己工作的成效与保卫和平的任务密切联系着，从而提高了工作的积极性。大家普遍反映：我们积极做好工作，就是增加和平的力量。对苏联的和平政策的实质及世界人民保卫和平运动，也有了进一步的体会。
    其次，对苏联第五个五年计划的世界意义也有了进一步的认识。特别是对于“苏联的今天就是我们的明天”体会得更加确切和具体，许多同志反映：“好像亲眼看到了共产主义社会”。正因为这次学习对于干部是一次丰富的共产主义教育，所以大家都把学习和自己的工作有机地结合起来，用对照的方法联系实际检查了工作。并使大家认识到马林科夫指出的缺点，在本溪煤矿中不仅大量存在，其严重程度比马林科夫同志所指出的还要严重的多。如：（一）由于有些干部对提高劳动生产率是改造社会主义生产的重要条件认识不够，因而使煤矿有二千九百马力（仅算五十马力以上的）可以够两个牛心台煤矿（年产三十余万吨）用的机械设备运用率被浪费了。有一个吹风机，原用十马力即可，而现在用一百二十五马力，一年即浪费人民币达七千多万元。这样严重的问题过去根本没有注意。（二）完成计划不平衡，去年全矿总的生产指标是完成了计划，而大掌子没有完成计划，小掌子超额完成了计划，但质量低劣。特别是在制订和贯彻计划上存在着严重问题，计划科缺乏对实际情况的了解，只掌握数字，每当做计划时，工程师、坑长和技术员不去很好地研究计划，而是“讨价还价”，致使工作造成损失。（三）推广先进经验存在若干问题，如“大冒落”“水打眼”“截煤机”等苏联先进经验和先进操作方法，由于技术领导上的保守思想而不得推广。正如矿长检讨说：“这些问题在过去不是一点不知道，经过这次学习才更加了解了，并且找到了解决问题的钥匙”。第三、在学习马林科夫报告第三部分中，大家都以批评与自我批评的武器展开自下而上的检查，批判了技术人员的保守观点和怕负责任的思想，改善了技术人员之间的关系，并对如何提高技术问题，提出了一百一十九件建设性的意见。煤矿领导上也进行了自我批评，检查了过去不重视推广全国劳动模范曲福明先进经验的错误思想。从学习马林科夫报告中更进一步研究了提高劳动生产率。其根本办法，必须改善劳动组织，加强民主管理，推广先进经验，挖掘潜在力量，加强技术人员的思想教育。如在改善劳动组织方面已初步将过去分散的检修力量集中起来，这样一个半月的工作效率就要等于过去一年的工作效率。只要继续改进，将来可有条件实行快速检修法。在推广先进经验方面，拟定用轮训班方法推广。特别是对干部、尤其是技术人员的思想教育已加重视。田大田矿长说：“煤矿存在的问题不仅是技术潜力没有挖出，更重要的是干部‘思想潜力’没有挖出”。此外，目前还注意了纠正生产上“前松后紧”和各“掌子”生产的不均匀偏向。田矿长说：“搞了几年工业也没摸着门，经过这次学习才摸到了搞工业的门径。”
    本溪煤矿干部的学习所以有成绩，除了领导方面重视，适当安排时间，建立切实可行的制度，有计划有领导地规定学习进度外，组织中心学习小组并加强对中心学习小组的领导，对巩固和推动一般干部学习起了极大作用。本溪煤矿领导上将全矿党、政、工、青以及主要科长和工程师等二十人组成一个中心学习小组；中心小组又划分三个分组，组长由党委书记、矿长担任。这些同志都比其他同志先学习一步，然后分别指导各科、股的学习，给他们解答问题，指导讨论。这样就带动了一般干部的学习，并使学习推向高潮，收到良好的效果。
