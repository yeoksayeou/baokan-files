    CPC Central Committee East China Bureau Holds Industrial Conference
    Emphasizing the Implementation of the Central Government's Key Construction Policy, Fully Utilizing the Potential Strength of Existing Enterprises
    The CPC Central Committee East China Bureau held the East China Industrial Conference from January 29th to February 11th. The conference focused on discussing the industrial production policy of the East China region during the first Five-Year Plan construction period starting in 1953. It criticized the prevailing tendencies in the past three years of industrial recovery and development, including the "everything is waiting to be done," blind advancement, greed for quantity and scale, and localism and departmentalism that only considered local interests.

    At the conference, Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the CPC Central Committee East China Bureau, delivered a report on the industrial production work in the East China region in 1953. He stated that the entire East China region had seen significant recovery and development in industrial production over the past three years. For example, the total production value of factories and mines under the former East China Industrial Department in Shanghai and Nanjing was eleven times that of 1949. The proportion of industry in the entire East China region has reached about 48% of the total industrial and agricultural output value (of which mechanized industry accounts for about 80%, and workshop handicraft industry and individual handicraft industry accounts for about 20%). However, in the recovery and development of production, many regions and departments had significant blindness, often failing to consider the overall situation, prioritize tasks, or focus on tapping the production potential of existing factories and mines. Instead, they were keen on expanding and building new light industrial factories, or arbitrarily increasing production without considering the overall market needs. This not only caused a great waste of manpower and financial resources but also hindered the progress of key national construction. To implement the central government's key construction policy, he pointed out that the East China region would not be the focus of national construction for a considerable period in the future, and the original machine manufacturing industry and light industry foundation were relatively good. Therefore, in our industrial production in the future, in addition to resolutely ensuring the completion of the key expansion and new construction tasks stipulated by the central government, we should focus on using the foundation and equipment of existing enterprises to fully unleash their potential, accumulate funds for the country, and train a large number of technical and management personnel to support the construction of heavy industry and national defense industry, which are decisive in national construction.

    Comrade Tan Zhenlin then pointed out that in addition to resolutely implementing the key construction policy, the planning of industrial production must be grasped tightly in 1953. He required all responsible cadres of industrial and mining enterprises to establish the concept that "the national plan is the law," and to understand that whether each factory and mine, each product, can be completed according to the plan has a significant impact on whether the national economic construction can proceed smoothly. To ensure the completion of this year's production plan, it is necessary to fully tap potential capabilities and the creative power of the masses, oppose the conservative thinking of suppressing the plan, and make the plan truly play a guiding and organizing role in production. After the plan is formulated, all forces must be mobilized to strive to complete and exceed the plan, and a mass discussion and inspection system for the plan must be established to ensure the comprehensive completion of production tasks.

    Regarding the issue of strengthening leadership in basic construction, Comrade Tan Zhenlin pointed out that the Party committees of all provinces and cities must immediately elevate basic construction to a primary position, especially the secretaries of the provincial and municipal Party committees should personally take charge, to accumulate experience in this area. Key departments and factories and mines for basic construction should clearly prioritize basic construction, while units with lighter basic construction tasks should also adhere to the policy of giving equal importance to production and basic construction, and resolutely correct any form of thought and practice that relaxes leadership in basic construction. To effectively ensure the completion of this year's basic construction tasks, in addition to immediately transferring a large number of cadres, technical personnel, and management personnel to establish and strengthen construction engineering bureaus, construction companies, and construction site management organizations at all levels, and carefully verifying basic construction plan projects, in the first quarter of this year, we should focus on grasping the three key links of survey and design, organizing construction forces, and actively preparing and transporting engineering materials.

    The conference discussed how the East China region should resolutely implement the central government's key construction policy based on the spirit of Comrade Tan Zhenlin's report. Many responsible individuals from the industrial departments of the provinces and cities present at the meeting reviewed the past situation of blindly developing industry: some were established to solve local finances and organ welfare, some were established by various specialized company systems based on local and temporary needs or purely for the purpose of making money, some were established from a purely relief perspective or to cope with temporary tasks, and some were established to build "industrialized" cities where the leading organs were located. The result of this blind development was that the growth rate of consumer goods production exceeded the growth rate of producer goods production, which seriously hampered the nation's key construction. After this review, the participating representatives unanimously criticized this localism and departmentalism that only considered local interests, and began to realize the important significance of correctly implementing this policy, not only in words but also in actions. At the same time, it was pointed out that after clarifying the key construction policy, it is necessary to prevent the tendency to ignore the enthusiasm of localities and various economies.

    The conference also discussed the issue of production reform in factories and mines, exchanged and summarized experiences between regions, and studied issues such as improving the leadership level of enterprises and strengthening political work in enterprises.

    中共中央华东局召开工业会议
    强调贯彻中央重点建设方针，充分发挥现有企业潜在力量
    中共中央华东局于一月二十九日到二月十一日召开了华东工业会议，着重讨论了一九五三年国家开始五年计划建设时期的华东区工业生产方针问题，批判了在过去三年多来恢复与发展工业生产中存在着的百废俱兴、盲目冒进、贪多喜大以及只从局部出发的地方主义与本位主义思想。
    会议首先由中共中央华东局第三书记谭震林同志作了关于一九五三年华东区工业生产工作问题的报告。他说：三年多来，华东全区工业生产有了很大的恢复和发展。如前华东工业部所属上海、南京两地的厂矿，一九五二年生产总值为一九四九年的十一倍。全华东区工业的比重在全部工农业生产总值中已达百分之四十八左右（其中机制工业约占百分之八十，工场手工业和个体手工业约占百分之二十）。但在恢复和发展生产中，不少地区和部门存在着很大的盲目性，往往不从全面考虑，不分轻重缓急，不着重发掘现有厂矿的生产潜力，只热中于扩建和新建一些轻工业工厂，或者不根据整个市场需要而任意增加生产，这样不仅造成人力、财力的极大浪费，而且势将妨碍国家重要建设的进行。为了贯彻中央重点建设的方针，他指出：华东地区在今后相当长远的时期中，均不是国家建设的重点，而原有的机器制造工业与轻工业基础又较好，因此，我们今后在工业生产上，除了坚决保证中央所规定的重点扩建与新建任务的完成外，应着重利用现有企业的基础和设备，充分发挥其潜在力量，为国家积累资金和培养大批的技术人材和管理人材，以支援在全国建设中具有决定意义的重工业与国防工业的建设。
    谭震林同志接着指出：除了坚决贯彻重点建设的方针外，在一九五三年必须抓紧工业生产的计划工作。要求所有工矿企业负责干部必须树立“国家计划就是法律”的观念，要知道每一个厂矿、每一个产品能否按照计划完成，对于全国经济建设能否顺利进行都有重大影响，为了保证今年生产计划的完成，必须充分发挥潜在能力与群众的创造力量，反对把计划压低的保守思想，使计划真正起指导与组织生产的作用。而在计划制订之后，就必须动员一切力量为完成和超过计划而努力，切实地建立群众性的讨论和检查计划的制度，保证全面完成生产任务。
    对于加强基本建设领导问题，谭震林同志指出：要求各省、市党委必须立即将基本建设提到首要地位，特别是省、市委书记更应亲自掌握，以便积累这一方面的经验。凡是基本建设的重点部门和厂矿，应明确以基本建设为首要工作，其他基本建设任务较轻的单位亦应掌握生产与基本建设并重的方针，坚决纠正任何形式的放松基本建设领导的思想与作法。为了有效地保证今年基本建设任务的完成，除了应立即抽调大批干部、技术人员、管理人员，建立与加强各级建筑工程局、建筑公司、工地管理机构，和认真核定基本建设计划项目外，在今年第一季度应着重抓住勘察设计、组织施工力量和积极进行工程材料的准备与运输等三个环节。
    会议根据谭震林同志报告的精神，讨论了华东地区如何坚决贯彻中央重点建设的方针问题。到会的不少省、市的工业部门负责人检讨了过去盲目发展工业的情况：有的是从解决地方财政和机关福利出发而办的，有的是各专业公司系统根据局部和临时需要或单纯以赚钱为目的而办的，有的从单纯救济观点或应付临时任务而办的，有的则是为了在领导机关所在地建设“工业化”城市而办的。这种盲目发展的结果，造成生活资料生产的增长速度超过了生产资料生产的增长速度，严重地妨害了国家的重点建设。经过这一检查，与会代表一致批判了这种只从局部出发的地方主义与本位主义思想；开始认识了不仅是在口头上，而且在行动上正确地贯彻这一方针的重要意义。但同时指出，在明确重点建设方针后，必须防止忽视发挥地方和各种经济的积极性的偏向。
    会议也讨论了厂矿的生产改革问题，交流与总结了各地区间的经验。并研究了提高企业的领导水平与加强企业中的政治工作等问题。
