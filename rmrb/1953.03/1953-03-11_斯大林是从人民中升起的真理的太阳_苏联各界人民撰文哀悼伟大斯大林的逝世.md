    “Stalin is the Sun of Truth Rising from the People”
     Articles from All Circles of Soviet People Mourning the Death of the Great Stalin

    Moscow newspapers have been publishing letters and articles from all walks of life in the Soviet Union mourning the death of J.V. Stalin in large numbers in recent days.

    Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, pointed out Stalin's great contribution to the development of Soviet science, saying that Soviet scientists often received guidance from their mentor and father, Stalin. The development of our linguistics, biology, physiology, physics, and other sciences is due to Stalin. He finally emphasized: Soviet scientists will spare no effort to implement Stalin's legacy, dedicate all their knowledge and creative efforts to the people, to the cause of Lenin and Stalin, and fulfill the task Comrade Stalin demanded of making Soviet science the first in the world.

    The poet Nikolai Tikhonov wrote: This sad news tore the hearts of people across the country, because Stalin is the sun of truth rising from the people. This sun shines on everyone, on the most advanced workers on the communist construction sites in our country, and on the black people in the colonial forests who are rising up against enslavement for the first time. This sun of truth rising from the people illuminates the path of the great Chinese people to historical victory, and the path of the heroic Korean soldiers who are fighting for the glory and independence of their country. The defenders of Stalingrad, who liberated the European nations from fascist enslavement, shouted the name of beloved Stalin and defeated the enemy. The Soviet people, shouting the name of beloved Stalin, conquered nature, transformed nature, dug canals, built new cities, built high-rise buildings, and developed new resources underground. Our whole life is filled with the brilliance of Stalin's name, filled with the life-giving power of his genius and his great love for mankind.

    Ye. Vinogradova and M. Vinogradova, who participated in the first Soviet Stakhanovite Workers Conference in 1935, wrote: The Soviet people have lost their beloved father, caring friend, and wisest counselor. With his genius and discernment, the great Stalin foresaw a massive movement of advanced workers and production innovators in the work of individual Stakhanovite workers. He was the brilliant organizer and inspirer of this patriotic movement of millions of laborers. Now, the Soviet Union has tens of millions of innovators in industry and agriculture. Closely united around the Communist Party, the Soviet people will strive for new labor achievements and faithfully implement Stalin's plan to build communism. The famous Ukrainian steelworker V. Kanaleikin said: The great Stalin always taught us that the more steel we produce, the stronger our country will be. Shortly before I wrote these words, I produced a batch of steel using high-speed methods ahead of schedule. All the steelworkers in our factory achieved such results.

    Bikov, a famous Soviet lathe operator and creator of high-speed cutting method, wrote: When I came to the factory in Moscow, I was a barely literate rural youth. Later, the factory educated me. Because of the creation of the high-speed cutting method, I was awarded the lofty title of Stalin Prize winner by the government. The people elected me as a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. All of this should be attributed to our great Communist Party, our dear government, and the beloved leader and teacher of the working class, Stalin. Bikov finally said: Dear Stalin has left us. We must unite more closely around the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government, and we must spare no effort to work for the welfare of the motherland and for the victory of communism.

    S. Pyatnitsa, a famous tractor driver and Socialist Labor Hero of the Altai Territory, wrote: Comrade Stalin taught millions of farmers like a father to build a new life. Because of him, Soviet farmers have happy collective farms, development, and a great transformation in their way of life.

    Kozhedub, a famous air force hero who was awarded the title of Soviet Hero three times, and Samsonov, a Soviet hero, pointed out in their articles Stalin's great achievements in leading the Soviet army to defeat German fascism, and described their respect and love for the great leader. They said: The soldiers of the Soviet army must be loyal to Stalin's legacy, constantly improve their military skills, and vigilantly defend peace and the labor of the Soviet people.

    A. Pokryshkin, who was awarded the title of Soviet Hero three times, wrote: Soviet soldiers, like all the people, feel infinite grief. Stalin's name is inseparable from the history of our armed forces and from the glorious victories of our glorious army and navy. On this day of national mourning, Soviet soldiers vow to unite more closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, tirelessly strengthen the combat power of the Soviet army, and vigilantly defend the security and national interests of the Soviet Union.

    The famous Soviet scientists Academician Ivan Petrovsky and Academician Trofim Lysenko called J.V. Stalin a giant of science. Academician Petrovsky wrote that, thanks to Stalin's brilliant leadership, our science has been able to achieve all these achievements. His wise instructions will always be the lighthouse of our creative work.

    The famous Ukrainian writer Ya. Korneichuk wrote: Ukraine is weeping before the coffin of our beloved father and teacher, Comrade Stalin. Lenin and Stalin led the long-suffering Ukrainian people to a bright and splendid road to freedom in the fire of revolution. When the fate of Ukraine was at a critical juncture, Comrade Stalin led the Red Army, marched in the snowstorms of the Donets steppe, and drove the interventionist troops and their running dogs, the White Guards and nationalists, into the Black Sea. The Ukrainian people gloriously passed all the arduous tests of the Great Patriotic War. The Russian people and other nationalities, shouting the name of Stalin, saved Ukraine from destruction and enslavement, and helped Ukraine heal its wounds in the shortest possible time. The Ukraine cultivated and educated by Comrade Stalin has become a powerful Soviet republic, which has left many capitalist countries far behind.

    M. Kovrigina, Minister of Health of the Russian Federation, wrote: This year's International Women's Day comes at a time when the Soviet people and working people all over the world are suffering an irreparable loss - the death of the great Stalin. J.V. Stalin accomplished a great cause: he seriously raised and correctly solved the women's question, the question of the status of women, the question of female workers, and the important role of working women and peasant women in economic, social and political life.

    M. Khardeyev, Secretary of the Moscow Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, said: Stalin's life is a great example of selfless struggle for communism. His glorious image will always be imprinted in the hearts of Soviet young men and women. As they bid farewell to our dear father, teacher, and friend, the members of the Moscow Communist Youth League and young people solemnly swear: to always and in everything be loyal sons and daughters of our Communist Party, sincere patriots of the socialist motherland, and to live, work, and study in the Stalinist way.

     苏联各界人民撰文哀悼伟大斯大林的逝世
    莫斯科各报连日以大量篇幅登载苏联各界人民痛悼约·维·斯大林逝世的来信和文章。
    苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫指出斯大林对于苏联科学发展的伟大贡献，他说苏联科学家们经常受到导师和父亲斯大林的指导。我们的语言学、生物学、生理学、物理学以及其他科学的发展都应归功于斯大林。他最后强调说：苏联科学家们将不遗余力地执行斯大林的遗训，把全部知识和创造性的努力都贡献给人民，贡献给列宁和斯大林的事业，完成斯大林同志所要求的使苏联科学达到世界第一位的任务。
    诗人尼古拉·吉洪诺夫写道：这个悲痛的消息撕裂了全国人的心，因为斯大林是从人民中升起的真理的太阳。这太阳照耀着每一个人，照耀着我们国家里共产主义工地上最先进的工人，照耀着殖民地森林中第一次起来反抗奴役者的黑人。这个从人民中升起的真理的太阳照亮了伟大的中国人民获得历史性胜利的道路，照亮了正在为他们国家的光荣和独立而战斗的英雄的朝鲜战士的道路。把欧洲各民族从法西斯奴役下解放出来的斯大林格勒保卫者高呼着亲爱的斯大林的名字击溃了敌军。苏维埃人民高呼着亲爱的斯大林的名字征服自然，改造自然，开凿运河，建造新的城市，建筑高楼大厦，在地下开发出新的资源。我们的全部生活充满了斯大林的名字的光辉，充满了他那能给人以生气的天才的力量和对人类的伟大的爱。
    参加过一九三五年苏联第一次斯塔哈诺夫工作者会议的叶·维诺格拉多娃和玛·维诺格拉多娃写道：苏联人民失掉了他们亲爱的父亲、关切的朋友和最有智慧的劝导者。伟大的斯大林以天才的明断，在个别斯塔哈诺夫式工作者的工作里预见到了声势浩大的先进工人和生产革新者的运动。他是这个千百万劳动者的爱国运动的光辉的组织者和鼓舞者。现在，苏联已经有成千万的工农业革新者了。紧密地团结在共产党周围的苏联人民，将为取得新的劳动成就而奋斗，将忠实地实现斯大林的建设共产主义的计划。乌克兰著名炼钢工人维·卡纳列伊金说：伟大的斯大林始终教导我们说，我们生产的钢铁愈多，我们的国家就愈是强大。在我写这几句话以前不久，我提前生产了一批用高速法炼成的钢。我们厂内的所有炼钢工人都得到了这样的成绩。
    苏联著名镟工、高速切削法创造人比科夫写道：我到莫斯科进工厂的时候，是一个识字不多的农村青年。后来工厂教育了我。由于创造了高速切削法，我被政府授予崇高的称号——斯大林奖金得奖人。人民选我为苏联最高苏维埃的代表。所有这一切都应当归功于我们伟大的共产党、亲爱的政府、工人阶级敬爱的领袖和导师斯大林。比科夫最后说：亲爱的斯大林离开我们了。我们一定更紧密地团结在党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围，一定不吝惜自己的力量，为祖国的福利，为共产主义的胜利而劳动。
    阿尔泰边疆区的著名拖拉机手、社会主义劳动英雄谢·彼亚特尼察写道：斯大林同志像父亲一般地教导千百万农民建设新的生活。由于他，苏维埃农民才有了幸福的集体农庄，有了发展，有了生活方式的巨大转变。
    三次荣获苏联英雄称号的著名空军英雄阔日杜布和苏联英雄萨姆索诺夫在文章中指出了斯大林领导苏军战胜德国法西斯的伟大勋绩，并叙述了他们对于伟大领袖的尊敬和爱戴。他们表示：苏联军队的战士们，一定忠于斯大林的遗训，不断地提高军事技艺，警惕地保卫和平与苏联人民的劳动。
    三度荣获苏联英雄称号的亚·波克雷希金写道：苏军战士和全体人民一样感到无限悲痛。斯大林的名字是和我国武装部队的历史分不开的、是和我们光荣的陆海军的辉煌胜利分不开的。在这举国哀悼的日子里，苏军战士宣誓要更紧密地团结在苏联共产党中央委员会的周围，不倦地加强苏军的战斗力量，警觉地保卫苏联的安全和国家利益。
    著名的苏维埃科学家伊凡·彼得罗夫斯基院士和特罗菲姆·李森科院士把约·维·斯大林叫做科学巨匠。彼得罗夫斯基院士写道，由于斯大林的天才的领导，我们的科学才能取得这一切成就。他的英明的指示将永远是我们的创造性的工作的灯塔。
    著名乌克兰作家亚·考涅楚克写道：在亲爱的父亲和导师斯大林同志的灵前，乌克兰在流泪。列宁和斯大林在革命的烈火中把长期受苦的乌克兰人民领上了光辉灿烂的自由大道。当乌克兰的命运处在紧急关头的时候，斯大林同志率领着红军，在顿尼兹草原的大风雪中进军，把干涉军及其走狗、白卫军和民族主义者赶下了黑海。乌克兰人民光荣地通过了卫国战争的一切艰苦的考验。俄罗斯人民和其他各族人民，高呼着斯大林的英名，从毁灭与奴役中拯救了乌克兰，并且在最短促的时期中帮助乌克兰把创伤治好了。斯大林同志所培养和教育的乌克兰已成为一个强大的苏维埃共和国，已使许多资本主义国家远远落在它的后面。
    俄罗斯联邦卫生部部长玛·科夫里金娜写道：今年的国际妇女节是在苏联人民和全世界劳动人民遭受不可补偿的损失——伟大的斯大林逝世的时候来到的。约·维·斯大林完成了一件伟大的事业：他认真提出了并正确地解决了妇女问题，妇女地位问题，女工问题和劳动妇女及农妇在经济、社会和政治生活中重要作用的问题。
    青年团莫斯科市委书记米·哈尔杰耶夫说：斯大林的一生是为共产主义而忘我奋斗的伟大榜样。他的光辉形象将永远印在苏联男女青年的心里。在向我们亲爱的父亲、导师和朋友告别的时候，莫斯科的青年团员和青年庄严地宣誓：要永远地、在一切事情上都作我们的共产党的忠实儿女，作社会主义祖国的赤诚的爱国者，按照斯大林的方式来生活、工作和学习。（新华社）
