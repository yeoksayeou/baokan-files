    Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1 of Fushun Mining Bureau has successfully designed a small furnace for refining oil from small pieces of oil shale, based on the suggestions of Soviet expert Zabrogin. The design of this small furnace, after repeated research and continuous improvements by Gu Jingxin, the chief engineer of the plant, and technicians Wang Jingli and Chen Fengqi, has met the requirements of economy and rationality. The Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry has awarded this successful design. The construction of this small furnace has now officially commenced.
    Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1 uses tens of thousands of tons of oil shale for dry distillation every day, of which 35 percent of the oil shale is small in size and not suitable for refining in the original dry distillation furnaces, and had to be discarded in the past. This is a great loss to national resources. Soviet experts believe that as long as the furnace type is changed, and independent small-piece transportation equipment and other necessary equipment are added, the technical problems of refining oil from small-piece shale can be solved. Encouraged by the Soviet experts, the plant's leadership and engineering technicians started by modifying a certain furnace for testing after several discussions. As a result of the modification, the utilization rate of oil shale increased from 65 percent to 85 percent. On the basis of this successful experiment, the plant began the design of a small furnace and finally achieved success. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北石油一厂设计小型炼炉利用小块油母页岩炼油成功
    抚顺矿务局东北石油第一厂，根据苏联专家扎布罗金的建议，设计用小块油母页岩炼油的小型炼炉成功。这个小型炼炉的设计，经过该厂总工程师顾敬心、技术人员汪景励、陈凤歧等多次研究，不断改进，达到了经济、合理的要求。中央人民政府燃料工业部对这一设计的成功已予以奖励。这个小型炼炉现已正式动工建设。
    东北石油第一厂每天有几万吨的油母页岩用作干馏，其中百分之三十五的油母页岩因块粒小，不适合在原有的干馏炉中炼，过去只好废弃不用。这对于国家资源是很大的损失。苏联专家认为只要改变炉型，增设独立的小块运输设备及其他必要的设备，对于小块页岩炼油的技术问题是能够解决的。在苏联专家的鼓舞下，该厂领导方面和工程技术人员经过多次讨论后，先把某号炉改装作了试验。改装结果，油母页岩的利用率由过去的百分之六十五提高到百分之八十五。在这个试验成功的基础上，该厂开始了小型炼炉的设计，终于获得成功。（新华社）
