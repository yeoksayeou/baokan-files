Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 26th: In the five days from March 17th to 21st, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers carried out multiple successful assault battles, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers.

    On the Western Front, there were battles almost every day. At 12:30 AM on the 17th, a unit of our army launched a fierce assault on an important position of the U.S. military near Gaowang Mountain, west of Lianchuan. After a powerful bombardment by our artillery, our infantry divided into four routes and charged up the mountain, quickly annihilating most of the three platoons of U.S. troops defending this hilltop. Our attacking troops held the hilltop, repelling three counterattacks from the enemy, ranging from one platoon to one company in size. Subsequently, our army voluntarily withdrew from the hilltop, carrying two heavy machine guns, five light machine guns, and twenty carbines back to our own positions. In this battle, our army killed or wounded more than 150 enemy soldiers. Before dawn on the 18th, in the assault battle on Beishan, northwest of Zuoshao, west of Wenquan, our army annihilated more than 50 U.S. troops, seizing one light machine gun and two automatic rifles. In another five assault, interception, and ambush battles, our army annihilated a total of more than 120 enemy soldiers.
    On the Central and Eastern Fronts, our army annihilated a total of 135 enemy soldiers in combat. In the latter half of the night of the 18th, our army on the Eastern Front attacked a position of the Rhee Syngman (ROK) puppet army south of Changchengli, annihilating most of an enemy platoon; at the same time, another unit of our army divided into two routes and attacked a Rhee Syngman (ROK) puppet army platoon position near Jiudong, southwest of Changchengli. The defending enemy suffered a surprise attack by our forces and 24 soldiers were annihilated, with the remaining enemy fleeing in panic.
    In these five days, our army's front-line mobile artillery killed or wounded a total of 493 enemy soldiers; the front-line anti-aircraft artillery shot down three enemy planes and damaged fourteen enemy planes.

The soldiers of Kim Kuk-cheol's squad once launched a surprise attack on the 854.1 high ground occupied by the enemy, annihilating 160 soldiers of the 12th Division of the Rhee Syngman (ROK) puppet army, which had taken over the defense from the U.S. 45th Division, and destroying 31 enemy fortifications. The warriors of the detachment led by Kim Ho entered a certain high ground on the front line of the enemy's position on the night of January 3rd, boldly and alertly directing mobile artillery fire to bombard the enemy's assembly point, killing or wounding 157 enemy soldiers and destroying seven enemy fortifications and barracks. The gunners of Park No-ok's detachment continuously improved their skills and accurately fired, killing or wounding more than 700 enemy soldiers in this month.
