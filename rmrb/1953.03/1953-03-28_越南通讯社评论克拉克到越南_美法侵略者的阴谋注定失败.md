    Vietnam News Agency Comments on Clark's Visit to Vietnam
    The Conspiracy of the American and French Aggressors is Doomed to Failure
    Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: In order to promote the U.S. policy of expanding the war of aggression in the Far East, U.S. Far East Commander Clark conducted five days of conspiratorial activities in Vietnam starting on March 19th. Clark left Hanoi on the 23rd.
    During his stay in Vietnam, Clark held talks with the French invading authorities and the Bao Dai puppet clique respectively, discussing the further expansion of the Bao Dai puppet army and the intensification of "aid" to the French invading army. He also visited the Bao Dai puppet officer training schools in Thu Duc and Nam Dinh.
    According to Agence France-Presse, before leaving Hanoi, Clark said that he would "suggest that the U.S. government step up the shipment of military equipment needed for the Indochina war" and re-arm another fifty battalions of the Bao Dai puppet army. He said that the French-announced plan to establish fifty-four battalions of the Bao Dai puppet army was a "beginning," and the Bao Dai puppet army "must be further expanded."
    Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: The Vietnam News Agency commented on March 25th on U.S. Far East Commander Clark's visit to Vietnam, saying: Clark visited Vietnam and discussed plans to continue the "dirty war" with the French colonialists. Clark's visit shows that U.S. imperialism is going to interfere more madly in the war in Vietnam to realize Eisenhower's conspiracy to expand the war of aggression in the Far East and "use Asians to fight Asians."
    The commentary said: Clark's visit is not the first example of American interference in Indochina. For many years, the United States has sent many generals and diplomats to Vietnam to help the French colonialists and the Vietnamese puppets. They have also sent hundreds of millions of dollars and a large amount of military equipment, including airplanes, tanks, artillery, guns, and ammunition. However, the French colonialists and their running dogs have suffered defeats and are falling into an increasingly passive position day by day.
    The commentary concluded: Inspired by past victories and with the warm support of progressive mankind, the Vietnamese people are determined to continue the war of resistance until complete victory. The conspiracy of the French colonialists and American interventionists is doomed to failure.

    越南通讯社评论克拉克到越南
    美法侵略者的阴谋注定失败 【新华社二十六日讯】为推行美国扩大远东侵略战争政策，美国远东军司令克拉克自三月十九日起在越南进行了五天阴谋活动。二十三日，克拉克已离开河内。
    克拉克在越南逗留期间，曾分别和法国侵越当局以及保大傀儡集团进行会谈，讨论进一步扩充保大伪军和加紧“援助”法国侵越军队的问题。他并曾到土德和南定去看了保大的伪军官训练学校。
    据法新社说，克拉克在离开河内前曾表示，他要“建议美国政府加紧运出印度支那战争所需要的军事装备”，再武装保大伪军五十个营。他说，法国已经宣布的建立五十四营保大伪军的计划，是一个“开端”，保大伪军“必须进一步扩充”。
    【新华社二十六日讯】越南通讯社二十五日评论美国远东军司令克拉克访问越南说：克拉克访问了越南并和法国殖民者讨论了继续进行“肮脏战争”的计划。克拉克的访问表明：美帝国主义要更加疯狂地干涉越南的战争，实现艾森豪威尔的扩大远东侵略战争和“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋。
    评论说：克拉克的访问不是美国干涉印度支那的第一个例子。多年以来，美国曾经派了许多将领和外交人员到越南帮助法国殖民者和越南傀儡。他们同时也送去了数以亿计的美元和大量的军事装备，包括飞机、坦克、大炮、枪支和弹药。但是，法国殖民者和它的走狗还是遭受了失败，并且一天天地陷于更加被动的地位。
    评论最后说：越南人民得到过去的胜利的鼓舞和进步人类的热烈支持，决心继续抗战到完全胜利。法国殖民者和美国干涉者的阴谋注定要失败。
