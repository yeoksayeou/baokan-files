Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On the afternoon of the 9th, simultaneous with the memorial services held in twelve major cities across the country to mourn the great revolutionary teacher Comrade Stalin, more than two thousand small and medium-sized towns where county-level and above people's governments are located also held memorial services. According to incomplete statistics from the capitals of twenty-three provinces alone, more than 2.64 million representatives from all ethnic groups and all walks of life participated in the memorial services. At this sorrowful moment, in vast cities and towns across China, from Manzhouli on the Sino-Soviet border to Baoshan County in southwestern Yunnan, from Xiamen on the southeastern coast to Kashi in the Pamir Plateau of Xinjiang, from the heroic city of Andong standing on the front lines of national defense to Kangding, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, from Anshan, the steel capital of New China, to Yan'an, the great revolutionary holy land, hundreds of millions of working people are bidding farewell to Comrade Stalin, the greatest genius of our time and the closest friend of the Chinese people.

The memorial services in various places were filled with a solemn and somber atmosphere. The venues were decorated in a simple yet dignified manner. At the memorial services across the country, countless people presented wreaths made by their own hands before Stalin's portrait. These wreaths symbolized the sincere sentiments of the Chinese people's boundless gratitude and deep mourning for Comrade Stalin. In Nanning, Guangxi Province, four female employees of a factory rushed to a place twenty miles away on the evening of the 8th to collect pine branches and worked overnight to make a wreath, which they presented before Stalin's portrait. Farmers in Gaomi County, Shandong Province, used cotton that had increased in yield by learning from the Soviet advanced experience - the close planting method - to weave a simple wreath, expressing their eternal remembrance of Stalin's kindness in helping the Chinese people. At exactly 5:00 p.m., as the people of Moscow were burying Comrade Stalin, the people in these cities and towns, like the Soviet people, with extremely grief-stricken hearts, observed a moment of silence in mourning for Comrade Stalin amidst the long wails of sirens. At the memorial services in various places, the local Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretaries made reports on the life and deeds of Comrade Stalin. In their eulogies, they all expressed that the Chinese people would unite closely with the Soviet people to ensure that the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples would forever develop and consolidate. They unanimously swore to resolutely advance along the path indicated by Comrade Stalin under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong.

The memorial services held in various places were also oath-taking rallies for the broad masses of people to begin combat actions under the slogan of "turning grief into strength." Before and during the meetings, people further expressed their intention to commemorate Stalin with better production, work, and study. In Taiyuan, the electric furnace steelmaking department of the state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant successfully trial-produced heat-resistant high-chromium steel for the first time on the 7th. The workers said that they would use this production achievement as a gift at the time of Comrade Stalin's burial. Labor model Huang Qingtai said, "Our steelmaking department was established with the personal assistance of Soviet experts cultivated by Stalin. We will not only present a gift to Comrade Stalin today but also better learn from Soviet advanced experience in the future." Fang Weipin, an old worker from a factory in Fuzhou, was recuperating, but on the day of the memorial service for Comrade Stalin, he resolutely requested to return to work. He pasted Stalin's portrait on the Soviet lathe he used, saying, "When I look at this photo, I feel that my body is very good." The people of Yan'an County are people who have long been tempered and educated by the revolution, and they have transformed their grief in mourning Comrade Stalin into resolute will. The farmers of Yangjialing and Zaoyuan, where Chairman Mao's former residences are located, unanimously stated: Although Stalin has passed away, the people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, must still unite like close brothers to defend our good life. All the members of the Li Youhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yan'an County proposed to further study the advanced experience of Soviet agricultural production, especially the experience of the Soviet Union in building mountainous areas. They proposed: This year, they will use the Soviet close planting method to sow more than nine acres of corn and more than six acres of millet, as an action to mourn the death of Stalin. Chen Shuangtian, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model who had visited the Soviet Union, participated in the memorial service for Comrade Stalin in his hometown, Tangxi County, Zhejiang Province, and immediately led the members of the agricultural production cooperative he led to formulate a production increase plan for the entire cooperative. He also expressed that he would continue to actively promote the happy life of Soviet collective farmers to the farmers of the whole county. Students from Sichuan University in Chengdu, in addition to participating in the memorial service, also held an "Exhibition of Comrade Stalin's Life and Works" on campus. All teachers and students unanimously expressed that they would seriously study Soviet advanced science and technology. (Attached picture)

    全国广大城市和乡镇
    亿万人民追悼斯大林同志
    据新华社讯：九日下午，和全国十二个大城市举行追悼伟大革命导师斯大林同志大会的同时，全国县以上人民政府所在地的两千多个中小城镇，也都举行了追悼大会。仅据二十三个省的首府的不完全统计，参加追悼大会的各族各界人民代表就有二百六十四万多人。在这个悲痛的时刻，全中国广大城市和乡镇，从中苏边界上的满洲里，到西南边陲的云南保山县，从东南海滨的厦门，到新疆帕米尔高原下的喀什噶尔，从屹立在国防前哨线上的英雄城市安东，到西康省藏族自治区的首府康定，从新中国的钢都鞍山，到伟大的革命圣地延安，数以亿计的劳动人民都在向当代最伟大的天才、中国人民最亲密的朋友斯大林同志告别。
    各地的追悼大会都充满着沉痛、肃穆的气氛，会场的布置简朴而庄严。在各地追悼会上，无数的人民在斯大林遗像前献上了他们亲手制成的花圈，这些花圈象征着中国人民对于斯大林同志无限感激和深切悼念的诚挚的心意。广西省南宁市某工厂有四个女职员在八日晚上赶到二十里以外的地方去采集松枝，连夜做成花圈，献在斯大林的遗像前。山东省高密县农民用学习苏联先进经验——密植法而获得增产的棉花，编成素洁的花圈，以表示他们永世不忘斯大林帮助中国人民的恩情。下午五时正，当莫斯科的人民正在安葬斯大林同志时，这些城市和乡镇的人民，都和苏联人民一样，怀着极其悲恸的心情，在长鸣的汽笛声中，向斯大林同志默哀悼念。在各地的追悼大会上，当地的中国共产党党委书记都作了关于斯大林同志的生平事迹的报告。他们在悼词中，都表示中国人民要和苏联人民紧密地团结在一起，使中苏两国人民的伟大友谊永远地发展和巩固。他们一致发出誓言，要坚定地在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下，遵循着斯大林同志所指示的道路前进。
    各地举行的追悼大会也是广大人民在“把悲痛变为力量”的口号下开始战斗行动的宣誓大会。人们在开会前和在大会上，都进一步表示要用更好地生产、工作和学习的行动来纪念斯大林。在太原市，国营太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部在七日第一次试炼耐热高铬钢成功，工人们表示要把这个生产成就作为在斯大林同志安葬时的献礼。劳动模范黄庆泰说：“我们的炼钢部是在斯大林培养出来的苏联专家亲手帮助下建立的，我们不仅今天给斯大林同志献礼，今后还要更好地学习苏联先进经验。”福州市某厂老工人方蔚品正在休养，在举行追悼斯大林同志大会的这天，他坚决要求复工。他把斯大林同志的像片贴在自己使用的苏联车床上，他说：“我看着这张照片，就觉得自己身体很好了。”延安县人民是久经革命锻炼和受过革命教养的人民，他们已把悼念斯大林同志的悲痛心情化为坚决的意志。毛主席故居的杨家岭和枣园的农民都一致表示：斯大林虽然逝世了，但我们中苏两国人民仍然要和亲兄弟一样团结起来，保卫咱们的好光景。延安县李有华农业生产合作社的全体社员，提出要进一步学习苏联农业生产的先进经验，特别是学习苏联建设山区的经验。他们提出：今年要在九亩多玉米和六亩多谷子田中，采用苏联密植方法播种，以此作为悼念斯大林逝世的行动。曾经访问过苏联的全国著名的农业劳动模范陈双田在他的家乡——浙江省汤溪县参加了追悼斯大林同志的大会后，回去立即带领他所领导的农业生产合作社的社员订立了全社的增产计划。他并表示要继续积极地向全县农民宣传苏联集体农民的幸福生活。成都市四川大学学生们，除了参加追悼大会外，还在校内举办了“斯大林同志生平事迹和著作展览会”，全校师生一致表示要认真地学习苏联先进的科学技术。（附图片）
