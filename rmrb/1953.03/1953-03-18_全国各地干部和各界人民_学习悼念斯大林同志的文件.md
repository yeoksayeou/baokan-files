Cadres and People from All Over the Country
Study Documents Commemorating Comrade Stalin

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party committees in various regions, cadres from Party organizations, government agencies, factories, schools, and military units across the country, along with teachers and people from all walks of life, have universally launched the study of documents commemorating Comrade Stalin. After the CPC Central Committee issued a notice regarding the study of documents commemorating Comrade Stalin, Party and government agencies, military units, and people's organizations in various regions made specific arrangements. Since the 12th, the vast number of cadres and people from all walks of life have begun reading the documents, organizing informal discussions, forums, and debates, in accordance with the regulations of the CPC Central Committee.

The CPC Central Committee's East China Bureau and the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee both convened special meetings to arrange the study. The CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee required cadres in senior study groups of various agencies to first master the material and to dedicate time to providing one or two enlightening or explanatory reports to general cadres to assist their study. Currently, over 75,000 cadres from East China's regional-level agencies and Shanghai have engaged in this study. The study group of the personnel section of the East China Finance Administration Bureau of the Central People's Government, in their discussions, connected the study with their own work attitude and resolved to learn from Comrade Stalin's glorious quality of loyalty to the people. Staff members of the East China Administrative Committee's Public Security Bureau deeply recognized during their study that the Soviet Communist Party is a party tempered and steeled under the guidance of Lenin and Stalin and will always be our example. Everyone expressed their intention to support the Soviet Communist Party with concrete actions that strengthen practical work and to unite even more closely with the Soviet Communist Party. The study groups of the Shanghai Science and Technology Popularization Association have focused their discussions on how to further learn from the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union to support the country's economic construction. Cadres and faculty from agencies, factories, and schools in Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian provinces, and Nanjing have also begun studying the documents. Cadres from county-level and above agencies in Fujian Province have participated in the study. The CPC Fujian Provincial Committee issued instructions to CPC local committees in various regions to strengthen leadership over this study. To strengthen guidance and assist general cadres in their study, various agencies convened study report meetings at the start of the study, connecting the current ideological situation of cadres, raising questions, and inspiring everyone to launch discussions based on the spirit of the documents. Cadres from provincial-level direct agencies participating in senior group studies are required to continue studying in small groups every Wednesday afternoon and to study with general cadres of the agencies every Saturday afternoon to promptly resolve the difficulties general cadres encounter in their study.

The CPC Central Committee's Central-South Bureau convened a standing committee meeting on the 12th to discuss organizing cadres to study based on the CPC Central Committee's notice of March 10th. The meeting held that secretaries of Party committees at all levels, Party branches, and responsible cadres of various agencies should personally and earnestly study and lead the vast number of cadres in their study, while also launching extensive publicity and education among the broad masses of people. The meeting decided that to help cadres study, leading comrades of the Central-South Bureau would deliver five reports to all cadres; members of the CPC Central Committee's Central-South Bureau would also participate in the study of their respective departments and branches. On the morning of the 13th, Li Xuefeng, Second Deputy Secretary of the Central-South Bureau and Vice Chairman of the Central-South Administrative Committee, convened a mobilization report meeting for CPC branch secretaries and responsible cadres of various direct agencies, calling on all cadres to earnestly conduct this study and actively transform their boundless grief for Comrade Stalin into a tremendous force through this study and implement it in all aspects of their work. Li Xuefeng emphasized that responsible comrades of Party committees at all levels must personally lead this study. The CPC Guangzhou Municipal Committee, the CPC Guangdong Provincial People's Government Direct Agencies Committee, and the South China Branch Bureau Direct Party Committee have all issued notices successively, and many agencies and factories have made mobilization reports for the study. In the CPC Guangzhou Municipal Committee system alone, 32,000 cadres in high, middle, and primary-level groups are participating in this study. The CPC Hubei Provincial Committee has made specific arrangements for the study of cadres throughout the province, and cadres from various agencies have begun their studies.

Cadres from agencies in the Southwest region and Chongqing, commanders and soldiers of the Southwest Military Region, school teachers, students, and workers and residents have been widely organized to study the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin. The Southwest Military Region Headquarters also issued instructions to universally launch the study throughout the military region. Over 60,000 cadres in Chongqing participated in the study. 13,000 propagandists throughout the city launched propaganda report work. Cadres of various ethnic minorities in Chongqing are studying Comrade Stalin's theory on ethnic issues. Tibetan, Hui, Miao, and other ethnic cadres working in the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Commission have drafted a plan to study Marxist-Leninist theory on nationalities. Jiang Anxi, a Tibetan cadre, said:

"The brilliance of Stalin's theory on nationalities will even more brilliantly illuminate the minority ethnic regions of the Southwest. Following his instructions and doing a good job in the Southwest's ethnic work is an eternal commemoration to him." The Chen Shulan group of the Shashi Yarn Factory formulated a patriotic pact in their study, guaranteeing to learn from Soviet advanced experience and improve their spindle watching ability. Workers at the 101 Steel Factory revised their patriotic pact during their study. Workers in the factory's machine shop continuously created new records during their study. Residents of Baizi Lane in Chongqing's First District automatically increased their study time to two hours to study the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin. Before reading the newspaper, propagandists collectively prepared, and the artillery units and public security units of the Southwest Military Region also dispatched cadres to explain the spirit of the documents to the soldiers. Responsible comrades of the CPC Chongqing Municipal Committee will also report to cadres of various units separately to help everyone understand the spirit of the documents. More than 32,000 cadres from Party and government agencies, mass organizations, and military units in Sichuan Province and Chengdu City have suspended their regular theoretical studies from the 13th and begun studying the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin.

Over 10,000 working cadres in Xi'an are participating in the study. Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in the CPC Xi'an Sixth and Seventh District Committees and the Xi'an Telecommunications Bureau universally formulated self-study plans for regularly studying Stalin's works during the study process. Many cadres, in addition to studying the documents commemorating Stalin, also set aside time to read "Brief Biography of Stalin" every day. The Propaganda Department of the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee has arranged the study. The Direct Party Committee of the CPC Central Committee's Xinjiang Branch has also stipulated the study steps. Ethnic minority cadres from Xinjiang provincial agencies are launching studies based on the documents published in the Uighur, Kazakh, and Mongolian versions of the Xinjiang Daily. Students in the Ethnic Group Department of the Northwest Art Institute have translated the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin into ethnic minority languages for collective study and group discussions.

Various departments of the CPC Central Committee's North China Bureau and mass organizations in the North China region have arranged studies. To enable cadres to more deeply recognize Comrade Stalin's great contribution to the world communist cause, some units are preparing to select cadres with higher theoretical cultivation to make central speeches at discussion meetings. Over 66,000 cadres in Tianjin have begun studying the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin. Reporters throughout the city have also begun reporting on Comrade Stalin's life in various factories, enterprises, agencies, organizations, schools, and streets. To cooperate with the study of documents commemorating Comrade Stalin, Nankai University, Tianjin University, and other schools have also opened reading rooms commemorating Comrade Stalin, displaying Stalin's works and pictures related to Comrade Stalin's life. The CPC Hebei Provincial Committee also instructed Party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership over this study, requiring CPC local committees in various regions to set an example and study even better. The CPC Taiyuan Municipal Committee first organized discussions among committee members to guide the study. To promptly understand the study situation, Hebei Province has designated CPC local committees in Baoding, Dingxian, and Tongxian as key points to report to the Provincial Committee regularly. To help district-level cadres study, CPC county committees and Party reporters in various counties of Hebei Province will go to the districts to give reports and organize discussions. Chang Zhenyu, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee's Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Branch Bureau, gave a mobilization report on the 14th at a cadre meeting of over a thousand people above the section chief level in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Suiyuan Province, and Guisui City. Various units are preparing for responsible comrades to give one or two reports on Comrade Stalin's life and deeds, and cadres of various agencies will further study Comrade Stalin's theory on nationalities. She Youshan, a cadre from the General Office of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government Chairman, said that after Comrade Stalin's death, I will redouble my efforts to study Comrade Stalin's great theories, especially the theory on nationalities, to fully arm myself and better complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party in ethnic regions.

Party and government agencies, people's organizations, and factories, enterprises, and schools at all levels in the Northeast and Shenyang have universally launched the study of documents commemorating Comrade Stalin. According to the situation in which the study of opposing bureaucracy is at a high tide, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee decided to conduct it simultaneously with the study of documents commemorating Comrade Stalin and extend the study time to the end of March. On the 12th, Huang Oudong, Secretary of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, made a mobilization at the city's Party member cadre meeting, requesting that the Party committees and Party branches of each district and factory effectively strengthen the organization and leadership of this study and calling on all Communist Party members in the city to actively participate in this study movement. Communist Party organizations of various agencies, factories, and schools have made specific plans based on the instructions of higher authorities. Party committees and branches of the CPC Central Committee's Northeast Bureau's various departments and commissions held informal discussions before the formal study to correct and clarify the purpose and significance of this study. The study of cadres sent to factories by the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions often could not be sustained in the past. This time, after mobilization by the Party branch, more than 200 cadres sent to factories actively expressed to the Party branch that they would guarantee the completion of the study task.
