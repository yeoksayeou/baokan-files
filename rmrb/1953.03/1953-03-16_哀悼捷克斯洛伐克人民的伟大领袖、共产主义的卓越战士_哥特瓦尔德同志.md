    Mourning Comrade Klement Gottwald, President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and close friend of the Chinese people, who unfortunately passed away on March 14th. The Czechoslovak people have lost their great leader, and the world's peace, democracy, and socialism camp has lost an outstanding fighter.

    Comrade Gottwald was a loyal student and comrade-in-arms of Lenin and Stalin, and an outstanding Marxist. He dedicated his entire life to the cause of liberation of his own motherland and people, and also to the great cause of internationalism of the working class. From joining revolutionary activities in 1912 until his death, he unyieldingly fought for the Bolshevikization of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the defense of the interests of the working people, for the struggle against fascist enslavement and the realization of the motherland's freedom and independence, for smashing the conspiracies of internal and external reactionaries and building socialism in Czechoslovakia; with unwavering efforts, he made significant contributions to the communist movement of the international working class, and to the cause of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    Comrade Gottwald used Marxism-Leninism to guide the revolutionary struggle of the Czechoslovak people. In his article "Struggle for the Bolshevikization of the Communist Movement," published in 1925, Comrade Gottwald wrote: "To Bolshevikize the communist movement and our party is the ability to utilize the experiences of revolutionary failures and victories in specific situations, is the ability to link revolutionary Marxism with the revolutionary actions of the broad masses tempered by mass struggle, and is the ability to prepare the proletariat to assume the tasks of the ruling class and the dictatorship of the proletariat." This is a concretization of Lenin and Stalin's theory of party building. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, led by Comrade Gottwald, achieved victory by advancing along the path of Bolshevikization based on Lenin and Stalin's theory of party building.

    Thanks to the victory of the Great Soviet Army's anti-fascist war, the Czechoslovak people were liberated; and thanks to the assistance of the great Soviet Union, the Czechoslovak working people embarked on the path of socialist construction. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, headed by Comrade Gottwald, united the working people of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia, and achieved great successes in the cause of realizing people's democracy and building socialism through heroic struggles against domestic and foreign enemies. The Czechoslovak people, under the leadership of Comrade Gottwald, uncovered and smashed the treasonous conspiracy center headed by Slánský in November 1952, which was of great significance for defending the victorious achievements of the Czechoslovak people. Comrade Gottwald pointed out this significance in his report to the National Conference of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on December 16, 1952. He said: "When we cut off the head of the American 'Fifth Column,' we will of course be stronger and more powerful." "Doesn't the fact that the party and its leading organs, without favoritism, resolutely purged the traitors prove how firmly we are loyal to the cause of the working class, loyal to the cause of the people, loyal to the cause of the nation, and loyal to the cause of socialism? We have long warned that no traitor can stand on our land, and that each of them will sooner or later suffer the punishment they deserve." Comrade Gottwald continued to point out: "The greatest damage caused by the treasonous conspirators was in the economic field, but they have not been able to stop the development of our national economy." The facts have fully proved that Comrade Gottwald's assertion was correct.

    Under the leadership of Comrade Gottwald, the Czechoslovak Republic began to implement its first Five-Year Plan in 1949. In the four years up to 1952, the total output of all industries increased by 82 percent, almost exceeding the pre-war 1937 level by a factor of two. Production in the past four years has increased by an average of 16 percent each year. The growth of Czechoslovakia's socialist construction will undoubtedly greatly strengthen the strength of the entire peace, democracy, and socialist camp, and strengthen the forces defending world peace.

    The government and people of the Czechoslovak Republic, under the leadership of Comrade Gottwald, have shown close friendship to the people of all countries in the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Our government and people and the government and people of the Czechoslovak Republic have deeply felt this close friendship in the friendly economic and cultural cooperation over the past three years; our two peoples have even more deeply realized that it is a supreme honor and happiness for us to be united within the world peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. In his article "The International and Domestic Situation and the Tasks of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia," published in March 1951, Comrade Gottwald, when speaking of "the party's main task at present," pointed out: "We must cherish the alliance and friendship with the great Soviet Union as we cherish our own eyes, and be loyal to the great Stalin to the end." This not only expressed the feelings of the people of the Czechoslovak Republic, but also expressed the common feelings of the people of all people's democratic countries.

    The Chinese Communists and the Chinese people are saddened by the loss of our close friend and outstanding communist fighter, Comrade Gottwald, after mourning the passing of the great Comrade Stalin; however, we understand even more that we should turn grief into strength, further enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people, unite even more closely with the Soviet people and the people of all people's democratic countries, heighten our vigilance, and continue consolidating and developing the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in his telegram of condolence to the Presidium of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, "I am convinced that Comrade Gottwald's brilliant contribution will forever inspire the people of China and Czechoslovakia to advance bravely and victoriously in further consolidating and developing the close unity and friendly cooperation between the people of China and Czechoslovakia, and in further strengthening the cause of the world peace and democracy camp headed by our common ally, the great Soviet Union." Although our great teacher Comrade Stalin has left us, his infinite wisdom will forever guide all mankind to run towards the direction he pointed out; although Comrade Gottwald has left us, we believe that the Czechoslovak people will unite more closely around the Communist Party and government of Czechoslovakia; the Communist Party members and people's heroes of Czechoslovakia, who were educated by Gottwald, will more heroically inherit Gottwald's legacy and push the cause of socialism to new victories.

    The heroic cause of Gottwald will be immortal!

    哀悼捷克斯洛伐克人民的伟大领袖、共产主义的卓越战士——哥特瓦尔德同志
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统、捷克斯洛伐克共产党主席、中国人民的亲密朋友克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志不幸于三月十四日逝世。捷克斯洛伐克人民丧失了自己的伟大领袖，世界和平民主社会主义阵营丧失了一位卓越的战士。
    哥特瓦尔德同志是列宁和斯大林的忠实学生和战友，是卓越的马克思主义者。他把全部生命贡献给了他自己的祖国和人民的解放事业，也贡献给了工人阶级的国际主义的伟大事业。从一九一二年参加革命活动直到逝世，他始终不屈不挠地为捷克斯洛伐克共产党的布尔什维克化和保卫劳动人民的利益而斗争，为反对法西斯奴役和实现祖国的自由独立而斗争，为粉碎内外反动派的阴谋和在捷克斯洛伐克建设社会主义而斗争；他以坚定不移的努力，对于国际工人阶级的共产主义运动作了重大的贡献，对于以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的事业作了重大的贡献。
    哥特瓦尔德同志运用马克思列宁主义指导了捷克斯洛伐克人民的革命斗争。在一九二五年发表的“争取使共产主义运动布尔什维克化”的论文中，哥特瓦尔德同志写道：“使共产主义运动与我们的党布尔什维克化，就是在具体情况下利用革命失败与胜利的经验的能力，就是把革命的马克思主义与经过群众斗争锻炼的广大人民的革命行动联系起来的能力，也就是准备好无产阶级担当统治阶级的任务和无产阶级专政的能力。”这是列宁斯大林的建党学说的具体化。以哥特瓦尔德同志为领导的捷克斯洛伐克共产党，就是依据列宁斯大林的建党学说，沿着布尔什维克化的道路前进而取得胜利的。
    由于伟大的苏联军队反法西斯战争的胜利，捷克斯洛伐克人民获得了解放；又由于伟大的苏联的援助，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民走上了社会主义建设的道路。以哥特瓦尔德同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党，团结捷克斯洛伐克各族的劳动人民，在实现人民民主制度和建设社会主义的事业中，经过了和国内外敌人的英勇斗争而取得了很大的成就。一九五二年十一月捷克斯洛伐克人民在哥特瓦尔德同志的领导下，破获和粉碎了以斯兰斯基为首的叛国阴谋中心案件，对于保卫捷克斯洛伐克人民的胜利果实具有极大的意义。哥特瓦尔德同志在一九五二年十二月十六日捷克斯洛伐克共产党全国代表会议上的报告中指出了这个意义。他说：“当我们把美国‘第五纵队’的头砍掉以后，我们当然会更加强大有力的。”“党和它的领导机关不徇情面，毅然把叛徒清洗掉，这个事实难道不是证明我们是如何坚定地忠于工人阶级的事业、忠于人民的事业、忠于民族的事业、忠于社会主义的事业吗？我们早就警告过，在我们的国土上没有一个叛徒能站住脚，他们每一个人迟早总要遭到应有的惩罚。”哥特瓦尔德同志继续指出：“叛国阴谋分子在经济方面造成的损害最大，但是他们并没有能够阻止我们国民经济的发展。”事实完全证明了哥特瓦尔德同志的论断是正确的。
    在哥特瓦尔德同志的领导下，捷克斯洛伐克共和国从一九四九年开始实行了第一个五年计划。截至一九五二年的四年中，全部工业的总产量提高了百分之八十二，几乎超过战前一九三七年水平的一倍。最近四年的生产量，平均每年提高百分之十六。捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设事业的增长，无疑地将大大加强整个和平民主社会主义阵营的力量，加强保卫世界和平的力量。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和人民，在哥特瓦尔德同志的领导下，对于以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的各国人民，表现了亲密的友谊。我国政府和人民与捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和人民，在三年来的经济和文化的友好合作中，深深地体会到这种亲密的友谊；我们两国人民更深切地体会到，我们团结在以苏联为首的世界和平民主社会主义阵营之内是无上的光荣和幸福的。在一九五一年三月发表的“国际和国内的局势及捷克斯洛伐克共产党的任务”一文中，哥特瓦尔德同志说到“当前党的主要任务”时指出：“我们必须像珍惜我们的眼睛一样珍惜与伟大的苏联的联盟和友好，并且对伟大的斯大林忠诚到底。”这不仅说出了捷克斯洛伐克共和国人民的心情，而且也说出了人民民主各国人民共同的心情。
    中国共产党人和中国人民在痛悼伟大的斯大林同志逝世之后，又丧失了我们的亲密朋友、共产主义的卓越战士——哥特瓦尔德同志，我们的心是悲痛的；但是，我们更懂得应该把悲痛变成力量，更加增强中捷两国人民的友谊，更加紧密地和苏联人民及各人民民主国家的人民团结一致，提高警惕，继续巩固与发展和平民主与社会主义的事业。正如毛泽东同志在给捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府主席团的唁电中所说，“我深信：在进一步巩固和发展中捷两国人民的亲密团结和友好合作，进一步增强以我们的共同盟邦——伟大的苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的事业中，哥特瓦尔德同志的辉煌贡献将永远鼓舞着中捷两国人民奋勇地胜利地前进。”我们的伟大导师斯大林同志虽然离开了我们，但是他的无穷的智慧永远教导着全人类向着他所指示的方向奔去；哥特瓦尔德同志虽然离开了我们，但是我们相信，捷克斯洛伐克的人民会更紧密地团结在捷克斯洛伐克的共产党和政府的周围；在哥特瓦尔德教养下的捷克斯洛伐克共产党人和人民英雄们，他们会更英勇地继承哥特瓦尔德的遗志，把社会主义的事业推向新的胜利。
    哥特瓦尔德的英雄事业永垂不朽！
