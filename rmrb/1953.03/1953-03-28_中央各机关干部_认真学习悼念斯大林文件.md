Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: Cadres of central government organs have, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, universally and earnestly studied documents commemorating Comrade Stalin from March 12th to 25th.

	During this study, the cadres' enthusiasm, consciousness, and seriousness in learning surpassed previous political studies. Many cadres of organs directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in addition to studying the prescribed documents, also read many of Stalin's works and "A Short Biography of Stalin." Cadres of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government almost all bought a copy of "A Short Biography of Stalin" and studied it in conjunction with the documents. Many cadres of the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Political and Legal Committee, the Ministry of Justice, and the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government also read "A Short Biography of Stalin." Most of the cadres of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government made study plans during the study. Cadres of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission system of the Central People's Government who went down to inspect work seized the time to read the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin on trains and ships.

	The leading role of senior cadres in studying and giving reports played a significant role in improving the thinking of general cadres and guiding them to study in depth. Gao Gang, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Central People's Government, personally convened a symposium of senior cadres to discuss study issues and made an important speech. Responsible cadres of various ministries of the Central People's Government made reports to all cadres of their respective units. For example, Liu Jie, Vice Minister of Geology, Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways, Zhang Linzhi, Vice Minister of the Second Ministry of Machine Building, Yao Yilin, Vice Minister of Commerce, and Liu Shi, Vice Minister of Education, all made reports. Senior cadres of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Marxist-Leninist College listed topics and deeply studied Stalin's theoretical contributions. When discussing Comrade Stalin's theoretical guidance on the Chinese revolution, the Political Department directly under the People's Revolutionary Military Commission focused on studying the united front, armed struggle, and the peasant question.

	Through this study, cadres of central government organs further systematically recognized Comrade Stalin's great contributions to the world communist movement, as well as his great assistance to the Chinese revolution; clearly recognized that the death of Comrade Stalin caused grief to millions of people because Stalin's thought and cause had grasped the broad masses of people around the world; recognized that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a party that has been educated by Lenin and Stalin for decades, and this party was, is, and will continue to be our example, and this example is of decisive significance to the Chinese people and the people of the world, and the Chinese people should learn from the great Soviet Union in all aspects. Through this study, they also realized that it is necessary to further strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is unbreakable, and that the strength generated by this friendship is truly invincible.

	Many cadres actively requested to join the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League during this study and strived to improve their work. During the study, sixty members of the New Democratic Youth League in the Ministry of Geology proposed to join the Communist Party of China, and more than sixty young cadres proposed to join the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Cadres of the Ministry of Finance proposed to revise the work plan in order to do their work better. Some cadres of organs directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made a guarantee: We must study Stalin's great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" well. Cadres in the army system generally expressed that they would intensify the study of Soviet military science and strengthen national defense construction.

    中央各机关干部
    认真学习悼念斯大林文件
   【新华社二十七日讯】中央各机关干部按照中国共产党中央委员会的规定，从三月十二日到二十五日普遍认真地学习了悼念斯大林同志的文件。
    在这次学习中，干部的学习积极性、自觉性和认真的程度都超过以往的政治学习。中共中央直属机关的很多干部，这次除了学习规定的文件外，还阅读了斯大林的不少著作和“斯大林传略”。中央人民政府燃料工业部的干部，几乎每个人都买了一本“斯大林传略”，结合着文件进行学习。中央最高人民法院、最高人民检察署、政治法律委员会、司法部和法制委员会的很多干部，也都阅读了“斯大林传略”。中央人民政府地质部大部分干部在学习中订了学习计划。中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会系统下去检查工作的干部，无论在火车上、轮船上都抓紧时间阅读悼念斯大林同志的文件。
    高级干部的带头学习和作报告，在提高一般干部的思想和引导他们深入学习方面，起了很大的作用。中央人民政府国家计划委员会主席高岗亲自召集高级干部开座谈会，讨论学习问题，并作了重要发言。中央人民政府各部都由负责干部向本单位全体干部作了报告。如地质部副部长刘杰、铁道部部长滕代远、第二机械工业部副部长张霖之、商业部副部长姚依林、教育部副部长柳湜都作了报告。中共中央宣传部和马克思列宁学院的高级干部列出题目，深入地研究斯大林在理论上的贡献。人民革命军事委员会直属政治部在讨论斯大林同志对中国革命的理论上的指导时，着重研究了统一战线、武装斗争和农民问题。
    通过这次学习，中央各机关的干部进一步系统地认识了斯大林同志对世界共产主义运动的伟大贡献，以及对中国革命的伟大援助；明确认识到斯大林同志的逝世所以引起千百万人民的悲痛，是由于斯大林的思想和事业掌握了全世界广大的人民群众；认识到苏联共产党是受了列宁斯大林几十年教养的党，这个党过去是、现在是、将来依然是我们的榜样，这个榜样对中国人民和全世界人民是具有决定意义的，中国人民无论在那方面都应该向伟大的苏联学习。通过这次学习，也认识到必须进一步加强中苏友谊，中苏两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的，这种友谊所产生的力量是真正无敌的。
    许多干部在这次学习中，积极要求加入共产党和青年团，并努力改进工作。地质部在学习中有六十个新民主主义青年团员提出了加入中国共产党的要求，另有六十多个青年干部提出了加入中国新民主主义青年团的要求。财政部的干部提出要重新修订工作计划，以便把工作作得更好。中共中央直属机关有些干部提出保证：一定要把目前正在学习的斯大林的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”学好。军队系统的干部普遍表示要加紧学习苏联的军事科学，加强国防建设。
