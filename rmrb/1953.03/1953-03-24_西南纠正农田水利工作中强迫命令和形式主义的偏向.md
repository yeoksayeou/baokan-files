    The Southwest region is correcting the deviations of compulsory orders and formalism in farmland irrigation work, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of farmers for building water conservancy projects and developing production.

    Last year, in the struggle against drought, the Southwest region built many small-scale farmland irrigation projects and overcame the drought. However, in many areas, deviations of compulsory orders and formalism occurred. Rural cadres in Xuanhan County, Sichuan Province, without considering the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, rigidly stipulated that farmers should build 43 new ponds in five days, which aroused dissatisfaction among many farmers. The ponds and dikes built were not compacted, and the quality of the projects was very low. According to surveys, 30 percent of the small-scale farmland irrigation projects built in the Southwest region last year did not meet the standards, and 10 to 20 percent of the ponds and dikes have completely collapsed, resulting in a great waste of manpower and materials.

    In order to quickly correct this serious work style of compulsory orders and formalism, last winter, the People's Governments of various provinces in the Southwest sent inspection teams to inspect and understand the project situation in various places, and held meetings of beneficiaries to carry out mutual aid education of "equal value exchange of labor" based on the voluntary participation of farmers. Guangyuan Prefecture in Sichuan Province also conducted typical experiments at the township level, and learned from the experience of equal value exchange of labor in digging ponds and building dikes, and promptly promoted it to various places. Secondly, the People's Governments at all levels have strengthened technical guidance for farmland irrigation work. A total of 855 technical cadres were sent to the countryside in the region to assist farmers in building water conservancy projects. Various counties also ran training courses for water conservancy technical cadres, training township and village cadres and water conservancy models. Now, the enthusiasm of farmers for repairing ponds and building dikes has generally increased. In the first two months of this year alone, according to statistics from eight prefectures in Sichuan Province, 14,200 ponds, dikes, wells, and canals have been repaired. Farmers in Anshun Prefecture, Guizhou Province, have also formulated phased construction plans for farmland irrigation projects.

### 西南纠正农田水利工作中强迫命令和形式主义的偏向

    西南纠正农田水利工作中强迫命令和形式主义的偏向
    西南各地纠正农田水利工作中强迫命令和形式主义的偏向，大大提高了农民兴修水利、发展生产的热情。
    去年，西南各地在抗旱斗争中，曾兴修了不少的小型农田水利工程，战胜了旱灾。但是，有不少地区曾发生了强迫命令和形式主义的偏向。四川宣汉县农村干部不照顾受益户和非受益户，硬性规定农民五天修成新塘四十三口，结果引起许多农民不满，所修的塘堰都未夯实，工程质量很低。据调查，去年西南全区兴修的小型农田水利工程有百分之三十不合标准，其中有百分之十到二十的塘堰已全部垮毁，造成人力物力的很大浪费。
    为了迅速纠正这种严重的强迫命令和形式主义的工作作风，去年冬天，西南各省人民政府都曾派出检查组，检查、了解了各地工程情况，召开受益户会议，在农民自愿的基础上，作了“等价换工”的互助教育。四川省广元专区并以乡作典型试验，吸取挖塘筑堰中等价换工的经验，及时向各地推广。其次，各地人民政府都加强了农田水利工作的技术指导。全区派到农村协助农民兴修水利的技术干部，共有八百五十五人。各县还开办水利技术干部训练班，训练了乡、村干部和水利模范。现在，农民修塘筑堰的热情普遍增强，今年一、二两个月内，仅四川省八个专区的统计，整修好的塘、堰、水井、水渠，就有一万四千二百处。贵州省安顺专区的农民，并已订出分期施工的兴修农田水利工程计划。    （新华社）
