　　Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: Washington dispatch: Eisenhower presented a bill to the U.S. Congress on the 20th, requesting the U.S. Congress and the U.S. President to jointly declare that the United States would not be bound by international agreements signed by the United States and the Soviet Union during World War II. Eisenhower hoped to use this method to tear up international treaties and agreements and restore the rule of imperialism and reactionary forces in countries where the people have been liberated.

　　In the bill, Eisenhower completely reversed black and white, slandering the Soviet Union for "violating" the aforementioned international agreements. He insisted that the "situation" of 800 million people being liberated is a "threat" to the "security of all free people," including the United States, which the United States "cannot condone." Following this, Eisenhower requested Congress and the President to jointly declare two points: First, the United States "refuses" to recognize all international agreements that affirm the aforementioned "situation." Second, the United States "guarantees" to "restore" the old rule in the aforementioned countries.

　　U.S. Secretary of State Dulles testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 26th in support of Eisenhower's bill, providing a blatant explanation of the bill's implications.

　　He listed a specific list of countries where U.S. imperialism wanted to "restore" reactionary rule, including: Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Mongolia, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, etc.

　　He explained that Eisenhower's bill had two purposes. The first was to encourage reactionary forces around the world, especially to "rekindle" the "hope" of the remaining reactionary forces in the liberated countries. Because, he said, among these remaining forces, there has already been "a feeling of despair and that nothing can be done," and this feeling has produced a "paralyzing" effect. Not only that, but "some people within the free world" are also inclined to acknowledge the irreversible historical facts.

　　The second purpose is to prepare the way for the United States to openly trample on the Yalta and Potsdam agreements, etc., which the U.S. government itself signed, in a Hitler-like manner in the future. Dulles said very bluntly: "This bill also allows us the freedom to pursue other avenues and take other steps in the future as circumstances require."

### 艾森豪威尔在国会提出狂妄议案  图谋撕毁苏美间的国际协定

    艾森豪威尔在国会提出狂妄议案
    图谋撕毁苏美间的国际协定
    【新华社二十八日讯】华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔二十日向美国国会提出了一项议案，要求美国国会与美国总统共同宣布：美国将不受在第二次世界大战时美国和苏联共同参预签订的国际协定的约束，艾森豪威尔妄想用这种办法来撕毁国际条约和协定并在人民已经得到解放的国家恢复帝国主义和反动势力的统治。
    艾森豪威尔在议案里完全颠倒黑白地诽谤苏联“违反了”上述国际协定。他硬说八亿人民已得到解放的这种“情况”是对包括美国在内的“一切自由人民的安全”的“威胁”，美国“决不能够默认”。接着艾森豪威尔就要求国会与总统联合声明两点：第一是美国“拒绝”承认一切确认上述“情况”的国际协定。第二是美国“保证”要在上述各国“恢复”旧有的统治。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯二十六日在参议院外交委员会为艾森豪威尔的议案作证时，对这个议案的含意作了露骨的解释。
    他列举了美帝国主义要在那里“恢复”反动统治的国家的具体名单包括：拉脱维亚，立陶宛，爱沙尼亚，波兰，捷克斯洛伐克，德意志民主共和国，匈牙利，保加利亚，罗马尼亚，阿尔巴尼亚，蒙古，中国，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等等。
    他说明，艾森豪威尔议案有两个目的，第一是替世界反动势力打气，特别是“重新燃起”已获解放的国家的残余反动势力的“希望”。因为，他说，在这些残余势力中间，已经产生了“一种绝望和一切都无济于事的感觉”，这种感觉已经产生“瘫痪”的作用。不仅如此，而且“在自由世界内部也有一些人”倾向于承认无可挽回的历史事实。
    第二个目的就是替美国今后公开践踏美国政府自己签了字的雅尔塔和波茨坦等协定的希特勒式的行为作准备。杜勒斯十分露骨地说：“这个议案还使我们可以自由地按照情况的需要而在将来遵循其他的途径与采取其他的步骤。”
