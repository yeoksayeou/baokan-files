An Unforgettable Day
By Our Correspondents Liu Shiping, Lin Li, Ji Yin

At five o'clock in the afternoon of March 9th, this eternally unforgettable moment, the Soviet people bid farewell to Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world. The people of Shanghai, like all the people of China and the Soviet Union, with sorrowful hearts, held a memorial meeting for the great revolutionary teacher Comrade Stalin at the People's Square in the city center, attended by people from all walks of life in East China and Shanghai. The crowds silently gathered towards the city center. At the People's Square, at the Hongkou Stadium, at Zhongshan Park, at the Jiaotong University Square, and at the Workers' Club in Pudong, Communists, Youth League members, workers, shop assistants, students, women, PLA soldiers, and government workers stood before the giant statue of Comrade Stalin. As the whistle sounded a long blast in the sky, and the funeral bells pierced everyone's heart, millions lowered their heads, and hundreds of millions of hearts mourned one person; Shanghai and Moscow were equally silent and sorrowful. The preparations for the memorial meeting were completed with astonishing speed. In order to mourn Comrade Stalin, the worker comrades stayed up for two consecutive nights to build a square and altar that could accommodate 200,000 people. Four art workers worked overnight to paint a giant statue of Comrade Stalin. Soong Ching Ling, a peace fighter who had met Comrade Stalin two months earlier, made a large wreath and sent it to the memorial meeting to express her respect and love for Comrade Stalin. Comrade Chen Yi, Second Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made a solemn vow on behalf of the 130 million people of East China at the memorial meeting: Today, we swear before Comrade Stalin, the teacher who will live forever, that we are determined to turn our infinite grief into an invincible force and fight selflessly to realize Comrade Stalin's legacy! The Shanghai workers, with black纱 (gauze or crepe) bands on their hundreds of thousands of arms, deeply understand that their glorious revolutionary tradition is inseparable from the name of Stalin. How much help has the workers' movement in Shanghai received from Comrade Stalin! In the arduous days of 1922 when the Shanghai working class rose up to fight against imperialist elements and traitors, Comrade Stalin extended a helping hand. Shi Xiaomei, an old female worker of sixty-four years, told reporters: "When we held a big strike in 1922, the Japanese devils did not pay wages, trying to starve us to death. At this critical moment, we received relief. The relief fund was donated by the workers in Moscow, where Comrade Stalin was located." Hang Huilan, a female worker at the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, and her sister Hang Peilan, had both been to the Soviet Union and seen Comrade Stalin on the reviewing stand in Red Square. She kept recalling Comrade Stalin's kind and fatherly face, asking all the comrades who approached her: "Comrades, how can you make me believe that Comrade Stalin is really dead?" The workers of Shanghai are saddened by the death of Comrade Stalin, but they know that the best way to mourn Comrade Stalin is to produce more, and strengthen the strength and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. When the green light in the workshop turned on at 5:05 pm on March 9, Xu Shumin, the workshop director of the spinning workshop at the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, went over and pressed the button of the machine, the machine started, and the female workers in the entire workshop wiped away their tears and began to work hard. At the same moment, the workers of the A and B furnaces of the Shanghai Steel Plant also formed a solemn line in front of the open hearth furnace, looking towards Moscow from afar. At this time, the machine was still running, and the flames were still jumping, but the hearts of the workers had already flown to the ranks of the working brothers who were marching on Red Square. Five minutes passed, and the workers waved their iron shovels and plunged into the tense battle again. Old technician Jiang Tianyou said: "I will never forget this moment. Thinking of Comrade Stalin will inspire us to work harder." On this day, the workers completed seven hours of feeding tasks in six hours of operation. The soldiers of the People's Armed Forces of the motherland, who are standing on the frontier of national defense, expressed their determination to mourn Comrade Stalin with practical actions and with iron will. Young air force pilots Zou Jiajie and Zhang Huamei, like their other comrades, got up at 3:30 in the morning of March 9 and made combat preparations. The soldiers all wrote pledges and resolutions, to mourn Comrade Stalin with practical actions to defend the motherland's airspace. Comrades of the Navy fleet vowed to guard the coast vigilantly and to cherish ships and boats as they cherish their own eyes. The powerful and invincible People's Liberation Army's ground forces also swore an oath to Comrade Stalin. Combat hero Liu Kuiji said sadly: "In every arduous battle, when I was seriously injured on the front line, when I fought the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, when I charged into the enemy's nest alone, I often thought of your words: 'We Communists are people with special character. We are made of special material.' These words have increased my courage to kill the enemy a hundredfold and made me feel the unparalleled glory and pride of being a Communist." Li Landing, a first-class national people's hero award winner and model medical worker, swore an oath to Comrade Stalin: We will always advance under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, according to the path you have indicated. We will work harder to study the advanced Soviet medical scientific theories, skillfully master medical skills, rescue lives, reduce disabilities, and protect the health of the people. The vast number of government workers and young students, as well as people from all other walks of life, also made up their minds on this unforgettable day to strengthen their work and study.

    难忘的一天
    本报记者　刘时平　林里　季音
    三月九日下午五点钟，这个永世难忘的时间，苏联人民送别了全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志。上海人民和全中国、全苏联人民一样怀着悲痛的心情，在市中心的人民广场举行了华东和上海各界人民追悼伟大革命导师斯大林同志的大会。人流默然地聚向市中心。在人民广场，在虹口体育场，在中山公园，在交通大学广场，在浦东工人俱乐部的各个场地上，共产党员、青年团员、工人、店员、学生、妇女、解放军战士、机关工作者，站在斯大林同志巨像的面前。当汽笛在高空中发出长鸣，送葬的钟声刺痛着每一个人的心灵的时候，千万人低下了头，成百万人的心悼念着一个人，上海和莫斯科是一样静寂和沉痛。追悼大会的筹备工作是以惊人的速度完成的。工人兄弟们为了悼念斯大林同志，曾经两个通宵不睡觉，修成了可以容纳二十万人的广场和祭坛，四个美术工作者连夜赶画出了斯大林同志的巨像；两个月前曾经会见过斯大林同志的和平战士宋庆龄，做了一个大花圈，送到追悼会上，表示她对斯大林同志的崇敬与爱戴。中共中央华东局第二书记陈毅同志在追悼大会上代表华东一亿三千万人民发出庄严的誓言：今天我们对着千古长存的导师斯大林同志宣誓，我们决心把无穷的悲痛，化为坚强无敌的力量，奋不顾身地为实现斯大林同志的遗志而斗争！成千上万的手臂上圈着黑纱的上海工人们，深深懂得他们光荣的革命传统，是和斯大林的名字分不开的。上海的工人运动曾经得到过斯大林同志的多少帮助呵！当一九二二年上海工人阶级奋起向帝国主义分子和卖国贼们斗争的艰苦日月里，斯大林同志就曾经伸出过援助的手，六十四岁的老女工施小妹向记者说：“一九二二年我们举行大罢工的时候，日本鬼子不发工资，企图活活饿死我们，在这紧急的关头，我们得到了救济。救济金就是斯大林同志所在地莫斯科的工人捐助的。”国营上海第一棉纺织厂女工杭惠兰，她和妹妹杭佩兰先后去过苏联，在莫斯科红场的观礼台上看见过斯大林同志，她一直回忆着斯大林同志那慈父般的面容，向所有和她接近的同志们询问：“同志，你怎么使我相信斯大林同志真的死了呢？”上海的工人们为斯大林同志的逝世而悲痛，但他们知道悼念斯大林同志的最好办法是生产更多的东西，加强中苏两国人民的力量和友谊。当三月九日五点五分钟过后，车间里的绿灯亮了，国营上海第二棉纺织厂纺织间的车间主任徐叔敏，走过去一按机器的电钮、机器转动了，全车间的女工们揩干眼泪开始紧张地工作了。也就在这个时刻，上海炼钢厂甲炉和乙炉的工人，也在平炉跟前排成了庄严的行列，遥向莫斯科。这时，机器还在转动，火焰还在跳跃，然而工人们的心这时已飞向正在红场上行进的工人兄弟的行列里去了。五分钟过去，工人们挥动着铁铲又投入了紧张的战斗，老技师姜天佑说：“永远不会忘记这个时刻，想起斯大林同志，就会激动我们更努力生产。”就在这天，工人们以六小时的操作，完成了七小时的送料任务。站在国防前哨的祖国人民武装部队中的战士们，更以钢铁般的意志，表示决心用实际行动悼念斯大林同志。年轻的空军飞行员邹家杰和张华美，他们俩和其他战友一样，从三月九日的早晨三点半钟就起身，作好了战斗准备。战士们都写下了保证书和决心书，以保卫祖国领空的实际行动来悼念斯大林同志。海军舰队的同志们宣誓：要警惕地守卫海防，同时像爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护舰艇。强大无敌的人民解放军的陆军部队也向斯大林同志宣誓。战斗英雄刘奎基沉痛地说：“在每一次艰苦的战斗里，当我在火线上身负重伤的时候，当我同敌人肉搏的时候，当我只身冲进敌巢的时候，我常常想起你教导我们的话：‘我们共产党员是具有特种性格的人。我们是由特殊材料制成的。’这话使我百倍地增强了杀敌的勇气，使我感到做一个共产党员的无比的光荣和骄傲。”华东一级人民英雄奖章获得者、模范医务工作者李蓝丁向斯大林同志宣誓：我们永远在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，依着你所指示的道路前进。我们要更加努力学习苏联先进的医务科学理论，熟练地掌握医务技术，抢救生命，减少残废，保护人民的健康。广大的机关工作者和青年学生，以及其他各阶层人民，也都在这难忘的一天，下了决心，要加强工作和学习。
