How Conservative and Backward Design Ideologies Damage National Industrial Construction
    —Inspection of the Design Projects of Three Factories in Tianjin
    By Our Reporter Ji Yin
    The Tianjin Architectural Design Company conducted a major inspection of its 1952 design projects last December. Among the ten key projects inspected were a machine factory, a flour mill, and a winery. The series of problems exposed in the design work of these three factories centrally illustrates how frighteningly erroneous design thinking and work attitudes are damaging our nation's industrial construction.
    Disorganized "Patchwork"
    Walking into these factories, one quickly notices that they are all in a very disorganized state. For example, the flour mill's warehouse should logically be located close to the flour mill building to shorten transportation routes, as it needs to continuously supply wheat to the flour mill during production. However, the designers placed the factory building and the warehouse on opposite corners, far apart. This requires manual handling back and forth every day, wasting workers' time and energy and increasing production costs. In the machine factory, the heat treatment workshop is the center of the entire factory's operation, and products from all workshops must undergo heat treatment. It should undoubtedly be located in the center of all workshops. However, the designers placed it at the northernmost end of several workshops, requiring small tracks to be laid between the factory buildings for transportation. Even more absurdly, the designers placed the machine factory's foundry and forging workshops tightly together. This is absolutely unacceptable. The forging workshop is constantly hammering with dozens of tons of heavy iron hammers, and the workshop is in violent vibration from morning to night; however, the molten iron in the foundry cannot be subjected to vibration while it is solidifying.
    Walking into the factory buildings, more problems are found. Because the designers did not carefully understand the production situation beforehand and did not listen to the opinions of the producers, the architectural and mechanical designs were not closely coordinated, resulting in a series of absurdities: In the initial design, sixteen mills were to be installed in the flour mill's flour building, but after the factory building was completed, it could not accommodate sixteen mills. Now only eight are installed, leaving a large empty space. If those eight mills were installed, it could increase the daily production of flour by four thousand bags. When designing the flour building, the designers also forgot to leave holes in the floor slabs for the belts of the rotating machines to pass through. Only when installing the machines was it discovered that many holes had to be chiseled through the concrete floor slabs to thread the belts, leaving the entire factory building full of holes. The designers forgot about the machine maintenance issue, placing the factory building upstairs and the repair shop downstairs. When repairing the millstones, the workers had to carry the five hundred-plus-pound millstones downstairs, repair them, and then carry them back upstairs, damaging the stairs in the process. Some designers also forgot about equipment design when conducting structural design. The winery's building was completed, but heating equipment was not installed. Later, the new walls had to be broken to install heating. When the winery started production, it had to discharge a large amount of wastewater every day. This is common knowledge, but the designers forgot to install drainage equipment. This winery has to discharge 30,000 gallons of wastewater every day after starting operation, and the drainage problem has not been resolved to this day, so the factory cannot start production.
    These mistakes could have been completely avoided if the designers had conducted some investigation and research before starting the design and consulted the opinions of the producers. However, because the designers did not work with such a responsible attitude, the important departments of these factories have been placed in such an irretrievably unreasonable state.
    Obstacles to Future Production Development
    A design worker should have political and economic foresight. In the design process, they must not only see today's production needs but also see tomorrow's vision, and create good conditions for future development through their design. But the designers of these factories did not do this. For example, the winery is currently using manual production methods, but will it continue to maintain this backward production method in the future? If not, then this sturdy factory building, which can be used for fifty years, will have to be demolished and rebuilt. The designers squeezed the factory buildings of several factories very tightly. The flour mill can only expand to the west, but the warehouse is in the southeast. The more it expands, the farther this unreasonable distance will be, and the higher the transportation costs will be. The transportation roads of these factory buildings are also designed to be very narrow, with buildings on both sides. As production develops in the future, these narrow roads will become a major obstacle.
    These factories are all newly built, and some will soon be expanded. However, unreasonable designs have become obstacles to the development of these factories. The workshop technician of the machine factory said: The foundry's products currently supply several workshops and are still very abundant, with great potential. It can be developed quickly, but according to the current layout and structure of the factory building, development will be very difficult.
    Factory Buildings Sink, Roof Beams Break, Machines are Crooked
    The designers of these factories did not conduct soil surveys before designing, did not analyze the soil structure, and did not conduct soil pressure tests before hastily building houses on top. As a result, during construction, some factory sites had reeds underground, so they had to temporarily change the plan. Some houses were built before it was discovered that there was a soft soil layer underground. The buildings of these factories are now generally experiencing uneven settlement of the foundation and cracks in the building structure. The most serious settlement is in the flour mill. A machine room on the south side of the factory and a four-story machine room on the north side are connected. The four-story factory building has settled more, and the repair room has settled less. As a result, the main beam of the repair room broke, and 30 million yuan had to be spent to make a horizontal concrete beam to support the dangerous situation. On the west side of the flour mill's four-story machine room is the machine, and on the east side is the warehouse. The warehouse often has 200,000 catties of wheat, which is heavier than the west side. As the foundation settled, the entire building became crooked, and the machine also became crooked. The machine shaft is crooked, so it costs extra electricity. According to the factory's statistics, it only takes 0.9 kWh of electricity to produce one bag of flour in a normal factory, but it takes 1.3 to 1.4 kWh, which greatly increases the cost of production. More seriously, the result of uneven settlement will greatly shorten the lifespan of buildings and machines.
    "Rather Waste Than Save" Calculation Method
    Design workers should incorporate new scientific achievements into factory design through their work; and prepare a good environment for the future implementation of various advanced experiences in factories through design work. But the situation in these factories is the opposite. The arrangement of many factory buildings and machines did not take into account the convenience of future implementation of assembly line operations.
    Because the designers of these factories were afraid of taking responsibility, they generally adopted the lazy method of "rather waste than save" in the design, wasting a lot of steel bars, wood, and cement, and increasing the safety factor of the buildings. When designing the warehouse of the forging factory, the designer copied the calculation formula for the maximum wind pressure from an American architectural textbook, but was afraid that the wind in Tianjin was stronger than the wind in New York, so he also copied the maximum weight of the snow pressure. But this is absurd and ridiculous. Because the maximum wind pressure and the maximum snow pressure can never exist at the same time. When the wind pressure is the greatest, the snow has already been blown away. This absurd design wasted 65 million yuan for this building. The round wood of the winery's frame is also like this. The designer calculated in advance that a 15 cm diameter wood would be sufficient, but under the control of the "rather waste than save" thought, it was increased to 30 cm. Later, the owner added another 2.5 cm. This addition cost another 60 million yuan. Excessive use of materials in buildings does not necessarily make them very strong. Because the weight of a certain part of the building is increased, the correctly used part becomes a weak link, so the building loses its balance, and the building may be skewed as mentioned above.
    Because the designers did not adopt advanced design technologies, but based on backward British and American design standards, the funds of these factories suffered painful losses. According to the statistics of the flour mill, this waste accounts for 10% of the total cost of the entire factory, and some factories even exceed this number.
    Forgetting the Owners of the Factories
    The bourgeois design thought of "only valuing machines and not valuing people" is also very prominent in the design of these factories. The design of several factories generally ignores labor protection and safe production. The designer of the winery connected fourteen wine tanks, which are dangerous goods, into a large wine cellar and placed them in the middle of the dormitory and office. If one wine tank caught fire, fourteen wine tanks would be connected into a sea of fire and bury all the dormitories and offices inside. The flour mill also placed the flammable oil depot next to the workers' dormitory. The chimney of the machine factory's forging workshop spewed sparks all day long, but the designer placed the warehouse for storing dangerous goods next to the forging workshop; this warehouse used a non-fireproof wooden frame, and all the doors and windows of the warehouse were not equipped with fire-fighting equipment. A building as large as the flour mill does not have a safety brake.
    The designers did not consider how to ensure the safety of workers well, even some easy things were not done. The loading platform of the machine factory's foundry had a small door opened in the air on the second floor. If the workers were not careful when delivering materials, they would fall from the building. It would not be difficult to build a small wooden fence here. The lighting and echo of the factory building are a big problem for workers who live next to the machines all day long. Too strong light and too loud echoes directly increase the fatigue of workers and damage their health. The designers of these factories did not try to improve these facilities as much as possible based on the existing equipment conditions. Some factory buildings are too dark, and some factory buildings are too bright. One designer "ingeniously" opened many large glass windows in a workshop. The light in the room was dazzling, so the workers had to paint the window glass with paint.
    An engineer from the Tianjin Architectural Design Company who participated in the design of these factories said: "In the past, whether it was designing hotels or designing houses, we were very considerate of the owners, but when designing factories, we forgot the owners of the factories. When it comes to designing factories, we always thought that we were just putting machines into the factory building, and we never thought that there were hundreds of people living with the machines all day long." This is exactly the case. The workers of these factories were forgotten by the designers. For example, many factory buildings and buildings of these factories do not have toilets. The temperature inside the winery is very high. Even if you wear shorts to work in winter, you will sweat a lot. The workers have to put on all their clothes when they go outside to urinate. In order to make up for this defect, the flour mill installed two urinals under the stairs, making the upstairs reek of stench.
    The above are just a few of the main problems related to design work that were exposed in the engineering inspection of these factories.
    Through this field inspection, the designers of Tianjin Architectural Design Company have begun to deeply understand the reasons for these serious errors. Engineer Liu Wencai wrote painfully in his personal inspection summary:
    "The main reason for these errors is the design ideology. We have not realized why we design, who we design for, who uses the houses after they are built well, and how much loss it will cause to the country if the design is unreasonable. Because the design point of view is not clear, it has caused such incalculable losses to the country." Engineer Luan Quanxun said: "It is not that we don't know how to design toilets, it is not that we don't know how to design drainage ditches, we can do these things, the problem is that we didn't think of doing them." Many designers have found the causes of errors and ways to improve future design work from their own design thinking and work attitude.

    保守落后的设计思想怎样损害着国家工业建设
    ——天津三个工厂设计工程的检查
    本报记者　季音
    天津建筑设计公司在去年十二月曾进行了一次一九五二年设计工程的大检查。被检查的十个重点工程中有一个机器厂，一个面粉厂，一个制酒厂。这三个工厂在设计工作上所暴露出来的一系列问题，集中地说明了错误的设计思想和工作态度，是怎样可怕地在损害着我们国家的工业建设。
    凌乱的“拼凑”
    走进这几个工厂，人们很快就发觉这几个工厂都处在十分凌乱的状态中。例如面粉厂的仓库，在生产时要随时供给粉楼磨粉的麦子，照理它应该靠近粉楼以缩短运输道路。但设计者却把厂房与仓库分别放在南北两个角落上，远远分隔开来。每天需用人工来回搬运，既浪费了工人的时间和精力，也增加了生产的成本。在机器厂，热处理房是全厂作业的中心，各车间的产品都要经过热处理，毫无疑问，它应该设置在各车间的中心位置。但是，设计者却把它放在几个车间的最北面，厂房之间只好铺上小轨道来运输。更荒唐的是：设计者把机器厂的铸工场与锻工场二个车间紧紧摆在一起。但这是绝对不可以的。锻工场整日击动着几十吨重的大铁锤，场房从早到晚都处在剧烈的震动中；但铸铁厂中正在凝固的铸铁根本不能受震动。
    走进各厂的厂房，会发现更多的问题。由于设计者事先没有认真了解生产情况，没有很好地听取生产者的意见，以致他们作的建筑设计和机械设计没有密切配合，出现了这样一连串荒唐的事情：最初设计时，要在面粉厂的粉楼安装十六台磨，但厂房盖好以后，装不下十六台磨。现在只装了八台，厂地空了一大片。如果装上了那八台磨，每天可以增产四千袋面粉。在设计粉楼的时候，设计者又忘掉在楼板上留下穿过转动机器皮带的空洞，在装机器时才发现了，只好将洋灰楼板凿穿许多窟窿把皮带穿过去，使整个厂房百孔千疮。设计者忘掉了机器检修的问题，将厂房设在楼上，而把修理房设在楼下。在检修磨棍的时候，工人们只好将五百多斤重的磨棍抬到楼下，修好以后再抬上来，把楼梯都碰坏了。有的设计者在进行结构设计时又忘掉了设备设计。酒厂的建筑完成了，但没有安装暖气设备，以后只好把新墙敲破，安装暖汽。制酒厂进行生产时，每天要排出大量废水。这本是普通常识，但设计者却忘了安装排水设备。这个酒厂开工后每天要排泄三万加仑废水，至今仍未解决排水问题，工厂也无法开工。
    这些错误，设计者在动手设计之前，只要进行一些调查研究工作，征询生产者的意见，是完全可以避免的，但因为设计者没有以这样的负责态度进行工作，终于使得这些工厂的重要部门陷于这种无可挽回的不合理状态。
    今后发展生产的障碍
    一个设计工作者应该具有政治上经济上的远见。在设计中间，他不仅要看到今天的生产需要，还必须同时看到明天的远景，并且通过自己的设计为明天的发展创造良好的条件。但是这几个厂的设计者都没有这样作。例如酒厂，现在是手工生产方式，但将来还会保持这种落后的生产方式么？如果不是这样，那末，这座能用五十年的坚固厂房，只好拆掉重修。设计者把几个厂的厂房都挤得很紧。面粉厂只能向西发展，但仓库在东南，越发展就要把这种不合理的距离拉得越远，运输成本也就越高。这些厂房的运输道又都设计得很窄小，两边都是房子，随着将来生产的发展，这些窄小的道路都将成为很大的障碍。
    这几个厂都是新建厂，有的是很快就要发展扩大的，但是不合理的设计却成了这些厂发展的障碍。机器厂的车间技师说：铸工场的产品供应目前几个车间，还很宽裕，潜在力很大，很快可以发展，但依照现在厂房的布局及构造，发展就很困难。
    厂房沉、屋梁折、机器歪
    这几个厂的设计者在设计之前，没有进行土壤钻探，没有分析土层构造，没有进行土压试验，就草草地在上边盖起房子来。结果，在施工时，有的厂址地下是芦苇，只好临时改变计划。有的房子盖好以后，才发现地下是软土层。这几个工厂的建筑物现在已普遍发生工程基地沉陷不均、建筑结构发生裂纹的现象。沉陷最严重的是面粉厂。该厂南边的一间机器房和北边四层高的机器房是连在一起的，四层楼的厂房沉陷得多，修理室沉陷得少，结果修理室的大梁折断了，只好化三千万元做了根横的洋灰梁来支撑危局。面粉厂四层楼的机器房，西边是机器，东边是仓库，仓库这边经常有二十万斤重的麦子，比西边重。随着基础的沉陷，整个楼都歪了，机器也歪了。机器轴歪了，用电就特别费。据该厂统计，一般厂出一袋面只要用零点九度电，但他们却要用一点三到一点四度电，这就大大提高了生产的成本。而更严重的是不平均沉陷的结果，将大大缩短建筑物和机器的寿命。
    “宁费勿省”的计算方法
    设计工作者应该通过自己的工作，把科学上的新成就吸收到工厂设计中去；通过设计工作，为今后工厂推行各种先进经验准备一个良好的环境。但是这几个厂的情况是相反的。许多厂房机器的排列都没有考虑到将来实行流水作业时的便利。
    这几个厂的设计者由于怕负责任，在设计中普遍采用“宁费勿省”的偷懒办法，不惜浪费大量钢筋、木料和水泥，加大建筑物的安全系数。设计锻工厂仓库时，设计者原封地把美国建筑课本上最大风压的计算公式抄了过来，但又怕天津的风比纽约的风大，于是又把雪压的最大重量也抄上了。但这是荒谬可笑的。因为最大的风压与最大的雪压是决不可能同时存在的。当风压最大的时候，雪早就被吹走了。这一荒谬的设计，就使得这一建筑多浪费了六千五百万元。酒厂的房架圆木也是这样。设计人预先计算好用十五公分直径的木头就足够了，但在“宁费勿省”思想的支配下，又加到三十公分。以后业主又加了二点五公分。这一加，就又多支出了六千万元。建筑物用料过多，并不一定就很坚固。因为加重了建筑物某一部分的重量，那用料正确的部分相对地就成了薄弱的一环，这样，建筑物失掉平衡，就可能发生前面说过的建筑物歪斜的现象。
    由于设计人员没有采取设计上的先进技术，而是以英美落后的设计标准为依据，使得这几个厂的资金遭到令人痛心的损失。据面粉厂的统计，这种浪费占全厂总造价的百分之十，而有的厂还要超过这个数字。
    忘掉了工厂的主人
    “只重机器不重人”的资产阶级设计思想，在这几个厂里的设计中也表现的很突出。几个厂的设计普遍地忽视劳动保护和安全生产。酒厂的设计者把属于危险品的十四个酒池连成一个大酒库，安置在宿舍、办公室的中间。如果一个酒池失火，十四个酒池就会连成一片火海，并把宿舍办公室全部埋葬在里面。面粉厂也同样地把易燃的油库和工人宿舍紧靠在一起。机器厂锻铁工场的烟囱整日喷飞着火星，但设计者却把存储危险物品的仓库摆在锻铁工场的旁边；这个仓库用的是不防火的木房架，仓库所有门窗也没有安置防火设备。像面粉厂这样的大楼却没有设置一个安全制动闸。
    设计者没有很好地考虑如何保障工人的安全，即使是一些轻而易举的事情都没有做。机器厂铸工场加料台在二楼临空开了一个小门，工人们送料时稍不小心，就要从楼上摔下去，在这里建筑一个小木栅栏是毫不费事的。厂房的采光和回声，对于整天生活在机器边上的工人是个很大的问题，光线过强和回声过大，都直接增加工人的疲劳，损害健康。这几个厂的设计者却没有根据现有设备条件，尽可能地改善这些设备。有些厂房光线太暗，有些厂房光线太强。有一个设计人员“独出心裁”地在一个车间里开了许多扇大玻璃窗，屋里光线刺眼，工人们只好用油漆把窗玻璃涂起来。
    参加设计这些厂的天津建筑设计公司的一个工程师说：“过去无论是设计旅馆，设计住宅，都是替屋主人设想得十分周到，但在设计工厂的时候，我们却忘记了工厂的主人。谈到设计工厂，总以为只是把机器摆进厂房里，从来也没有想到还有成千成百的人整日和机器生活在一起。”事实正是如此。这几个工厂的工人是被设计者忘记了。例如：这几个厂的许多厂房、大楼都没有厕所。酒厂里面温度很高，即使在冬天穿了短裤做活，也要满头大汗。工人们走到外边去小便，又不得不把全部衣服穿起来。面粉厂为了弥补这种缺陷，在楼梯下边装了二个小便池，弄得楼上臭气扑鼻。
    以上，只是这几个工厂在这次工程检查中暴露出来的关于设计工作方面的几个主要问题。
    天津建筑设计公司的设计人员通过这次实地检查，开始比较深刻地认识了造成这样严重错误的原因。工程师刘文彩在个人检查总结中沉痛地写道：
    “造成这些错误的原因主要是设计思想问题。我们没有认清为什么设计，给谁设计，建筑好了房子给谁用，如果设计得不合理对国家有多大损失。由于设计观点不明确，所以给国家造成了这样不可计算的损失。”工程师栾全训说：“不是我们不会设计厕所，不是我们不会设计排水道，这些我们都是能够做到的，问题是我们没有想到去做。”许多设计人员从自己的设计思想、工作态度方面找到了造成错误的原因和改进今后设计工作的道路。
