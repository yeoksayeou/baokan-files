To the Central Council of Trade Unions of Czechoslovakia:

    In these days when we are mourning with infinite grief the passing of Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, we are shocked and saddened to hear the sad news of the passing of Comrade Klement Gottwald, the most beloved leader of the Czechoslovak people and an outstanding fighter of the workers' movement. The passing of Comrade Klement Gottwald is a great loss to the Czechoslovak people and the world peace and democracy camp. We extend our deepest condolences to all our Czechoslovak worker brothers. We sincerely hope that the working classes of China and Czechoslovakia will unite more closely, unite more closely around the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, heighten our vigilance, smash any imperialist aggression plots, and resolutely defend world peace.
                                The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions of China
                                March 15, 1953

    东北总工会的唁电捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会：
    正当我们以无限悲痛的心情哀悼全世界劳动人民伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志逝世的日子里，又惊闻捷克斯洛伐克人民最敬爱的领袖和工人运动的杰出战士克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志与世长辞的噩耗，使我们倍增悲痛。克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志的逝世，对捷克斯洛伐克人民和世界和平民主阵营都是重大的损失。我们谨向捷克斯洛伐克全体工人弟兄致以深切的哀悼。我们深愿中捷两国工人阶级更加亲密团结，更紧密地团结在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的周围，提高警惕，粉碎任何帝国主义的侵略阴谋，坚决保卫世界和平。
