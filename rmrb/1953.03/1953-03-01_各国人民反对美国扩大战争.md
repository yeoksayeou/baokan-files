    People of All Countries Oppose US Expansion of War
    Ceylon Trade Union Federation Condemns US Aggression Policy
    Threatens Ceylon's Food Supply and Rubber Market
    [Xinhua News Agency, 25th] Colombo News: The Ceylon "Tribune" recently published a statement by the Executive Committee of the Ceylon Trade Union Federation. The statement denounced Eisenhower's announced policy as a new stage in the aggressive and bellicose policy of the US ruling class. The statement particularly denounced Eisenhower's clamor to provoke China.
    The statement said: Eisenhower's policy is an open attack on Asian countries and a serious threat to world and Asian peace. This policy particularly threatens Ceylon's food supply and rubber market; to maintain this supply and market, Ceylon must fight to defend peace and oppose the US war policy.
    The statement called on Ceylon's business community and the people of the whole country to oppose Eisenhower's policy and strengthen the struggle for peace.
    "American Women for Peace Committee" and other groups
    Urge UN Delegates to Stop Korean War
    Xinhua News Agency: The "American Women for Peace Committee" said that its delegation and delegations from many other organizations had recently visited representatives of many UN member states and discussed with them the issue of ending the Korean War as soon as possible. The US delegation did not receive representatives from the Women for Peace Committee.
    According to a Boston dispatch published in the New York "Daily Worker" on the 17th, seven prominent citizens submitted a bill to the Massachusetts State Legislature, requesting the Eisenhower government to immediately conclude an armistice agreement and continue peaceful negotiations on the exchange of prisoners of war. The bill pointed out: "Except for the exchange of prisoners of war, complete agreement has been reached on all conditions for the armistice negotiations." Continuing the war for this single issue is causing continuous increases in US casualties and creating the danger of the war expanding at any time. The bill requested: "Immediately sign an armistice agreement, implement the armistice conditions that have already been agreed upon...and continue peaceful negotiations on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war."
    Those who proposed this bill further requested US citizens and groups to support this bill. The seven prominent figures who proposed this bill are: Mrs. Elizabeth Burr Boyton, Dr. Albert S. Dieffenbach, Reverend Joseph F. Fletcher, Dr. Robert Goldstein, Mrs. Israel P. Muls, Mrs. Elizabeth S. Raymond, and Reverend Nathaniel Wright.
    Many Local Trade Union Organizations and Students in Britain
    Oppose US Government's Policy of Expanding Aggression in Korea
    Xinhua News Agency: The London "Daily Worker" on the 18th listed twenty organizations that issued declarations, resolutions, and protests against the US expansion of the war of aggression in Korea, one of which was a telegram sent by one hundred Liverpool dockworkers to Churchill, demanding that the government take action to prevent interference with British shipping in the China Sea and demanding the withdrawal of British troops from Korea. The "Daily Worker" reported on the 16th: Labor Party Member of Parliament Desmond Donnelly recently said at a meeting in Abercrave (Breconshire) that Britain "must warn the United States that if it expands the war in the Far East, it must do it alone."
    The Brentwood Trades Council also requested the British Trades Union Congress to inform the government that organized workers in Britain would never participate in any blockade, bombing, or expanded action in the Korean War.
    The Lancashire and Cheshire Trades Councils held an annual meeting on February 21st. The annual meeting, representing more than 500,000 union members, passed a resolution calling for an immediate end to the Korean War. Out of eighty-seven representatives, only eight voted against the proposal.
    The Manchester Regional Council of the National Union of Railwaymen passed a resolution at its monthly meeting on February 22nd, requesting the Labor Party to hold a special meeting to discuss the issue of the US Far East policy threatening peace.
    Students from twenty-eight colleges and universities in Britain held a meeting in London on the 21st and 22nd to discuss the struggle for peace. The conference unanimously resolved to establish a Student Peace Council. A declaration was passed at the meeting, calling for an immediate end to the Korean War, and suggesting that a Five-Power Conference be held to resolve all outstanding international issues.
    The conference passed a resolution calling on the British government to firmly protest any attempt to blockade the Chinese coast.
    General Secretary of the Canadian Labor Progressive Party Issues Statement
    Calls for Stopping US Government from Expanding War of Aggression
    Xinhua News Agency: The "Canadian Tribune" reported on February 23rd: Tim Buck, General Secretary of the Labor Progressive Party of Canada, issued a statement calling on the Canadian people to help stop Eisenhower from expanding the war of aggression in Asia. The statement pointed out: The US war movement and the US trusts' plunder of Canada's rich oil, iron, nickel, and uranium mines are closely related. The new owner of most of the land in Canada's Labrador region is Eisenhower's Secretary of the Treasury, the US iron ore magnate Humphrey; Eisenhower's Secretary of State Dulles is the head of the Wall Street monopolists who obtain all the profits from Canadian nickel and copper mines. The Canadian people are deeply shocked and disturbed by Eisenhower's war actions. They do not want to see the unjust war being waged in Korea expand into a war against China, the Soviet Union, and the entire socialist region, because doing so would lead to Canada's destruction. The statement pointed out: In Ottawa, people are now gradually feeling the sentiment of the Canadian people against war plans. For example, recently a spokesperson for the Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation opposed the US attempt to expand the war of aggression in Asia in Parliament. The statement finally called on people from all walks of life in Canada to demand that members of parliament oppose Eisenhower's war measures, demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea, and sever Canada's ties with Eisenhower's war policy. The statement also called on the Canadian people to unite and defeat the government's conspiracy, at the instigation of the United States, to pass legislation to prevent worker activity, suppress democratic freedoms, and stifle the Canadian people's desire for peace.

    提出这议案的人更要求美国公民与团体支持这个议案。提出这议案的七位著名人士是：伊丽莎白·伯·波依顿夫人、艾伯特·斯·迪芬班奇博士、约瑟夫·夫·弗莱彻牧师、罗伯特·戈尔茨坦博士、伊斯尔·帕·穆尔斯夫人、伊丽莎白·斯·雷蒙德夫人与纳山尼尔·赖特牧师。

    据新华社讯：“加拿大论坛报”二月二十三日报道：加拿大劳工进步党总书记蒂姆·布克发表声明，号召加拿大人民帮助制止艾森豪威尔扩大在亚洲的侵略战争。声明指出：美国的战争运动和美国托辣斯掠夺加拿大富饶的石油、铁、镍和铀矿的行为，是密切相关的。加拿大拉布拉达地方大部分土地的新主人是艾森豪威尔的财政部长、美国铁矿大王汉弗莱；艾森豪威尔的国务卿杜勒斯就是取得加拿大镍矿和铜矿所有利润的华尔街垄断资本家的头目。加拿大人民对于艾森豪威尔的战争行为深深震惊不安，他们不要看到在朝鲜进行的不义战争扩大为对中国、苏联以及整个社会主义地区的战争，因为这样做要使加拿大毁灭。声明指出：在渥太华，人们现在已渐渐感觉到加拿大人民反对战争计划的情绪了。例如最近加拿大合作联盟的发言人就在议会里反对美国企图扩大在亚洲的侵略战争。声明最后号召加拿大各阶层的人民要求议员反对艾森豪威尔的战争措施，要求立即在朝鲜停火，并且使加拿大断绝与艾森豪威尔战争政策的联系。声明还号召加拿大人民团结起来，击败政府在美国唆使下企图通过法案阻止工人活动、压制民主自由以及扼杀加拿大人民和平愿望的阴谋。
