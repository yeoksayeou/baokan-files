Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: According to TASS Moscow, February 1st, "Red Star" published an article by Lieutenant Colonel Troyanovsky of the Soviet military medical detachment, entitled "The Heinous Crimes of the American Aggressors." The article stated that new evidence of the monstrous crimes committed by the American warmongers is discovered every day. Referring to the confessions of captured American officers Huebner and Blair, the article wrote: American aggressors are using science—a product of human wisdom—to carry out large-scale massacres of civilians.

The article continued: Soviet scientists are doing everything possible to fight diseases that take the lives of millions of people, seeking ways to prevent infectious diseases, while the "scientific" lackeys of American imperialism are manufacturing evil bacteriological warfare weapons to spread epidemics and poison humanity with deadly germs. But they had better recall that neither bacteria, nor other barbaric weapons of human destruction, were able to save the fate of Hitler or Hirohito. These things will certainly not save the fate of the new contenders for world hegemony.

The article wrote: The camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the great Soviet Union, is growing stronger day by day. Its ranks include outstanding scientists. The goal of the science of life, represented by the science of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, is to ensure the victory of communism in our country and the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism throughout the world.

The decadent "science" of American imperialism—the "science" of death—aims to enslave and barbarically destroy humanity, spread epidemics on a large scale, and save the imperialist system of enslavement that the masses of people hate.

The article concluded: But just as the forces of historical progress will inevitably defeat the evil forces of the old capitalist world—the forces of imperialism and war—so too will the science of life inevitably defeat America's "science" of death.

Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: According to the Romanian News Agency, "Spark" commented on February 28th that the confessions of two American prisoners, Huebner and Blair, clearly demonstrate that the American interventionist forces in Korea used vicious bacteriological weapons. Huebner and Blair were both senior American officers who were aware of the most secret plans and actions of the US military headquarters. Their confessions prove the entire malicious plan painstakingly formulated and implemented by the highest American military institutions for the large-scale use of this despicable and abhorrent means of warfare—bacteriological weapons. American imperialists dared to violate the most basic rules of international law and human morality, which even the cannibalistic beasts of the Nazis dared not violate. Both officers affirmed that the US military headquarters kept the use of bacteriological warfare strictly secret, fearing that the other side, their allies, and their own officers and soldiers would know. This is sufficient proof that the organizers of this abhorrent bacteriological warfare are terrified in the face of the awakened people, because they used one of the most barbaric weapons in human history, arousing the indignation of the people.

"Spark" wrote that when the truth about bacteriological warfare and the truth about the atrocities of the US military sent to destroy Korea become known, this anger will certainly rise infinitely. Therefore, the American rulers and their representatives attending the United Nations are trying to cover up the truth and prevent representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from presenting their views at the United Nations. But the truth cannot be concealed. The ever-growing righteous anger of the people of all countries, especially the hatred of the people of Asian countries, is directed against the American aggressors. The heroic Korean people, with the support of the brave Chinese People's Volunteers and hundreds of millions of Chinese people, have repelled all the attacks of the American aggressors; they all know that their own strength is closely linked with the ever-growing and invincible strength of the entire socialist peace camp.

    苏“红星报”和罗“火花报”斥美国进行细菌战
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：“红星报”刊载了苏军医疗大队中校特罗扬斯基的一篇文章，题目是“美国侵略者的穷凶极恶的罪行”。文章说：美国战争贩子所犯的滔天罪行的新证据每天都有发现。文章在说到被俘的美国军官许威布尔和布莱的供词时写道：美国侵略者正在利用科学——人类智慧的产物——来干大规模屠杀平民的勾当。
    文章接着说：苏联科学家正在尽一切力量对夺去千万人的生命的疾病作斗争，寻求防止传染病的方法，而美帝国主义的“科学”奴才却在制造罪恶的细菌战武器，用以传布病疫，使致命的病菌毒害人类。可是他们最好回想一下：不论细菌也好，或者其他野蛮的毁灭人类的武器也好，都没有能够挽救希特勒或裕仁的命运。这些东西也一定挽救不了新的世界霸权争夺者的命运。
    文章写道：以伟大的苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营一天比一天壮大。它的队伍里有着卓越的科学家。以苏联和各人民民主国家的科学为代表的生命的科学的目标是：保证共产主义在我们的国家取得胜利，使和平、民主与社会主义在全世界获得胜利。
    美帝国主义者的腐朽的“科学”——死亡“科学”——的目标却是奴役和野蛮地毁灭人类，大规模地散布疫病，挽救人民群众所痛恨的帝国主义奴役制度。
    文章最后说：但是，正如历史进步的力量必然会战胜旧的资本主义世界的邪恶力量——帝国主义和战争的力量——一样，生命的科学也必然会战胜美国的死亡“科学”。
    【新华社二日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社消息：“火花报”二月二十八日评论说：两个美国俘虏许威布尔和布莱的供词，清楚地说明了在朝鲜的美国干涉军使用了恶毒的细菌武器。许威布尔和布莱都是美国高级军官，他们是知道美军司令部最秘密的计划和行动的。他们的供词证明了美国最高的军事机构为了要大规模使用这种卑鄙可恶的战争手段——细菌武器而苦心制订并实行的全部恶毒计划。美帝国主义者竟胆敢违犯连纳粹吃人野兽也不敢违犯的最基本的国际法和人类道德的规则。这两个军官都肯定地说，美军司令部对于使用细菌战是严守秘密，害怕对方、他们的盟国和自己的军官和兵士知道的。这正足以证明：由于这种可恶的细菌战的组织者使用了人类有史以来的最野蛮的武器之一而激起了觉悟了的人们的愤恨，这些细菌战的组织者在他们面前是惊慌万分了。
    “火花报”写道，当关于细菌战的真相和被派去摧毁朝鲜的美军的暴行的真相为大家知道的时候，这种愤怒一定会无限地激昂起来。因此美国统治者和他们出席联合国的代表都在设法掩饰真相，并阻止朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表去联合国陈述意见。但是真相是掩藏不了的。全世界各国人民愈来愈大的正义的愤怒，首先是亚洲各国人民的仇恨，都在反对美国侵略者。英勇的朝鲜人民在勇敢的中国人民志愿军和亿万的中国人民的支持下，打退了美国侵略者的一切进攻；他们都知道，他们自己的力量是和愈来愈大的不可战胜的整个社会主义和平阵营的力量密切结合在一起的。
