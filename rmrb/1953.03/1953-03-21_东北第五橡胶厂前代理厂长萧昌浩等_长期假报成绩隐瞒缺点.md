    Former Acting Director of the Northeast Fifth Rubber Factory, Xiao Changhao, etc.
    Long-Term False Reporting of Achievements, Concealing Shortcomings
    Xiao Changhao, former acting director of the Northeast State-Owned Fifth Rubber Factory, and Miao Xiufang, the deputy director, have consistently disregarded product quality, arbitrarily raised product prices, and engaged in illegal and undisciplined behavior by submitting false reports to deceive higher authorities.

    In the second half of last year, the factory made 126,000 meters of sprayer hose for the sprayer factory. Due to poor operation, the hose leaked, and more than 33,000 meters were returned after delivery, resulting in a loss of over 600 million yuan. When making rubber shoe soles for the outfitting factory, the thickness was uneven, some were cracked, and some had forgotten to install iron pads. There are still tens of thousands of unqualified shoe soles in the warehouse. Another urgent and important production task was also not taken seriously by the leadership, and two-thirds of all products were unqualified, half of which were waste products.

    Due to the poor quality of the products, the factory only completed 90 percent of its production task last year, but Xiao Changhao and others reported to higher authorities that it was "fully completed," and even "over-fulfilled" the profit target. How was their profit "completed"? It turns out that Xiao Changhao, Miao Xiufang, and others took advantage of the fact that many products manufactured by the factory could not be made by other rubber factories to arbitrarily increase product prices and defraud profits. For example, the original unit price of a full set of Hegang-style pit overalls was 935,000 yuan, but the factory increased the unit price of each top and bottom piece to 727,200 yuan. In January of this year, they made rubber rings for Factory 128. The cost of each rubber ring plus the enterprise's profit was only 2,500 yuan. However, they set the unit price at 13,000 yuan. Due to poor storage, more than 3,000 meters of tarpaulin were damaged, which Xiao Changhao and others also concealed. The factory still has a large number of defective products in stock, some of which even date back to 1949. Xiao Changhao and Miao Xiufang feared that their mistakes would be discovered by the leadership, so they "rewarded" cadres at or above the section level every quarter. The bureaucratic work style of the leadership of the Northeast Light Industry Administration is also serious. They do not understand the real situation and have long believed these false reports, so that the bad behavior of Xiao Changhao and others has not been corrected in a timely manner. (Chen Xingjia)

### 东北第五橡胶厂前代理厂长萧昌浩等  长期假报成绩隐瞒缺点

    东北第五橡胶厂前代理厂长萧昌浩等
    长期假报成绩隐瞒缺点
    东北国营第五橡胶厂前代理厂长萧昌浩和副厂长苗秀芳，一贯忽视产品质量，任意抬高产品价格，并且违法乱纪打假报告欺骗上级。
    去年下半年，该厂给喷雾器厂做了十二万六千公尺喷雾器胶管。因操作不良，胶管漏水，交货后被退回了三万三千多公尺，损失六亿余元。给装具厂制作胶鞋掌，因薄厚不均，有的裂口，有的忘记装铁垫，至今仓库里还存有不合规格的鞋掌十几万双。另一项紧急的重要生产任务，也因为领导方面不重视，全部产品中有三分之二不合格，其中有一半是废品。
    由于产品质量低劣，去年该厂只完成生产任务百分之九十，但萧昌浩等向上级报告却说是：“全部完成”了，利润方面还“超额完成”了。他们的利润是怎么“完成”的呢？原来，萧昌浩、苗秀芳等利用该厂承制的许多产品其他橡胶厂不能制作的条件，任意提高产品价格，诈取利润。如做鹤岗式坑内服全套单价原为九十三万五千元，但该厂却将上、下身每件单价提高到七十二万七千二百元。今年一月份给一二八厂做胶圈。每个胶圈的成本加上企业利益才两千五百元。但是他们竟把单价订为一万三千元。由于保管不好，损坏了三千多公尺雨布，萧昌浩等也隐瞒不报。现在该厂仍库存大批废品，其中甚至还有一九四九年留下来的。萧昌浩、苗秀芳怕自己的错误被领导方面发觉，竟然每个季度都对科级以上干部进行一次“奖励”。东北轻工业管理局领导方面的官僚主义作风也是严重的，他们不了解真实情况，长期相信这些假报告，以致萧昌浩等人的恶劣行为没有能够及时纠正。（陈兴家）
