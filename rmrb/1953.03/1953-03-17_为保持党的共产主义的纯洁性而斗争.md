The decision of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to expel the anti-Party element Huang Yifeng from the Party has been made for over a month. This correct decision of the East China Bureau is a great victory in the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline called for by the Central Committee; at the same time, it provides a living example for Shanghai's Party organizations to fight, directly strengthening our ability to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Under the guidance of this spirit, we convened the first municipal Party Congress, earnestly reviewed our work and the state of the Party, further promoted intra-Party democracy, and carried out criticism and self-criticism, giving the whole Party a new understanding of ideological work.

From examining the state of the Party in Shanghai, we deeply realized:

"The Communist Party of China should, through the method of criticism and self-criticism, regularly review the errors and shortcomings in its work to educate its members and cadres and correct its errors in a timely manner. The Communist Party of China opposes arrogance and complacency, fearing to admit its mistakes, and fearing criticism and self-criticism." (General Program of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China) This is the force driving our Party's cause forward. In the process of revolutionary struggle, our Communist Party and every Communist Party member must rely on the frequent use of criticism and self-criticism to expose various shortcomings and errors in our work and thinking and correct them in a timely manner, to ensure that our work is done well, that the revolutionary cause advances, and that our work does not suffer losses due to mistakes. This is one of the most distinctive hallmarks distinguishing our working-class communist party from other political parties. It demonstrates our Party's serious and responsible attitude towards the people and the revolutionary cause.

The anti-Party element Huang Yifeng completely violated this fundamental principle of the Party, placing himself in an anti-Party and anti-people position, directly becoming a deadly enemy of the Party. This is the fundamental reason why the Party expelled Huang Yifeng. Only by resolutely and uncompromisingly expelling such bad elements from the Party can the Party's organization be better purified and the Party become increasingly consolidated and strong. However, as the Liberation Daily editorial pointed out: "Although deceivers like Huang Yifeng have no legitimate status in our Party and have been expelled from the Party, similar bad elements to Huang Yifeng and similar bad practices of deceiving superiors and suppressing subordinates have not been eliminated." In terms of the state of the Party in Shanghai, the various bad things, large and small, that have been revealed just before and after the First Party Congress are already shocking. Among them, the most prominent is Su Bo, the former Secretary of the Jiangning District Committee, who consistently resisted the organization and acted independently during his tenure. He believed that he had contributed to the revolution, but the Party had not given him a more important position, so he often spread discontent and resisted the execution of instructions and decisions from the Party at higher levels. Within the District Committee, he implemented a patriarchal leadership style, acted arbitrarily, arbitrarily decided or revoked work deployments, and appointed cadres without authorization, disregarding the organization and doing whatever he wanted. Su Feng, Secretary of the Zhabei District Committee, was politically and ideologically degenerate and consistently treated the work he presided over with a bureaucratic attitude, implementing a patriarchal leadership style within the Party. After his various errors were exposed by the representatives of the Zhabei District Committee at the Party Congress, he became enraged and threatened the Party by demanding to withdraw from the Party, even shamelessly proposing that the Party keep his secrets "so as not to hurt feelings." The anti-Party nature of such degenerate elements was completely exposed in the face of the serious principles of the Party. The common characteristic of their behavior and that of the anti-Party element Huang Yifeng is "the extremely dangerous tendency to treat the unit they lead as an independent kingdom and do whatever they want, resisting the leadership of the Party and splitting the Party." They are precisely the people who have that absurd idea, "They think that the Party will eventually compromise and yield to them, reach an understanding with them, and no longer provoke them, because they are Party members with status and history and must be treated differently."
    (People's Daily Editorial) They do not understand that the cause of the Party is the cause of the people, and the interests of the Party are based on the interests of the people. Any selfish and self-interested elements who attempt to use the Party to achieve their personal interests will inevitably degenerate to the point of opposing the Party, and finally, like Huang Yifeng, be purged from the Party. Of course, bad elements like Su Feng and Su Bo, like Huang Yifeng, have no legitimate status in the Party and are also extremely bad examples, but similar dangerous tendencies are not isolated within our Shanghai Party organization, as Comrade Chen Yi pointed out, "but there are a number." Party members who hold leadership positions in some units often place personal interests above the interests of the Party, causing great losses to the interests of the Party. In addition, this dangerous tendency also exists in some middle and lower-level organizations. A small number of bad elements usurp leadership positions, extort and blackmail in the name of the Party and the People's Government, ride roughshod over the people, and undermine the relationship between the Party and the people. This is something that our entire Party in Shanghai and our leading cadres must pay special attention to. These events warn us that after the "Three-Anti", Party Rectification, and anti-bureaucracy struggles, bad elements like Su Feng and Su Bo were still able to occupy leading positions in the Party, and their degenerate nature was not exposed in time, which also exposed that the democratic life within our Party is abnormal. Although some criticisms and education, and even organizational measures, have been taken against their erroneous behavior, such as transferring Su Bo from his original post during the "Three-Anti" period for education, and Su Feng making a self-criticism to the Party during the "Five-Anti" period, because it was not raised to the level of high disciplinary principles, "The Party must resolutely remove those who have committed serious crimes in their current work, and those who have repeatedly made mistakes in history and have not been reformed after repeated education, in order to maintain the communist purity of the Party." (People's Daily Editorial) As a result, these bad elements used the Party's policy of "curing the sickness to save the patient" as a talisman to cover up their mistakes and deceive the organization. From here, we have a deeper understanding that improving the democratic life within and outside the Party, improving the education of criticism within the Party and strict adherence to discipline, and improving the Party's ideological work and cadre work have become urgent tasks within our Shanghai Party.

Recently, the first Party Congress of the city, based on the instructions of the Central Committee against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, the decision of the East China Bureau on the Huang Yifeng incident, and the spirit of the People's Daily editorial on January 23, "Those Who Suppress Criticism Are the Deadly Enemies of the Party," combined with summarizing the work of 1952, fully promoted intra-Party democracy, and seriously launched criticism and self-criticism. The tendency of leaders at all levels and various departments and some Party cadres to varying degrees to practice bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline has been widely exposed, especially the errors of anti-Party elements such as Su Feng and Su Bo have been exposed and criticized, and a serious struggle has been launched. Due to the initial victory of this struggle, our entire Party has gained a new and good start in improving the democratic life within the Party, improving criticism and self-criticism within the Party, and launching the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. But we must further point out: To make the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline deeply developed and completely victorious, the main key lies in first opposing the various forms of bureaucracy that exist in the leadership at all levels, so that the struggle can be carried through to the end. The Shanghai Party organization must further strengthen the Party's organization and discipline, improve the Party's leadership style and working methods, eliminate negative and unhealthy phenomena within the Party, and maintain the communist purity of the Party through this struggle.

It should be pointed out that the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline cannot adopt the approach of seeking only a sensational burst, but must be gradually deepened from top to bottom with leadership and focus, and then quickly turn into a regular practice after the struggle has achieved a certain purpose. Therefore, the Shanghai Party organization must closely combine with various tasks according to the unified deployment of the Municipal Party Committee and implement this struggle in various tasks. First, convey the spirit of the First Party Congress, organize all Party members and cadres to study relevant documents, improve the political awareness and ideological level of all Party members, overcome the liberal attitude of reconciliation and appeasement towards bad people and bad deeds; break various ideological obstacles, and correctly grasp the guidelines and policies; secondly, according to different situations, start from handling the problems that have been exposed, from focusing on checking and summarizing work, or from checking and handling letters from the people, and deeply launch this struggle. This struggle should first be launched from the municipal and district-level organs and groups, and then gradually implemented to the grass-roots units in a planned manner; and in implementing this struggle, we must earnestly implement it with a realistic attitude and oppose any rough and bureaucratic practices. Only in this way can this struggle be more in-depth, lasting, and thorough; can we eliminate the bad bureaucracy and Kuomintang style left over from the old society, can we better consolidate the relationship between the Party and the people, and can we more effectively guarantee the victorious completion of the national plan.

We firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and our Party Central Committee and the East China Bureau, victory will surely belong to us! Comrades! Unite and strive to maintain the communist purity of the Party.

    为保持党的共产主义的纯洁性而斗争
    中共上海市委第四书记　陈丕显
    中共中央华东局宣布关于开除反党分子黄逸峰党籍的决定，至今已经一个多月了。华东局这一正确的决定，是中央号召全党反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪斗争中的一个极大的胜利；同时给上海党的组织带来了一个活的战斗的榜样，直接地加强了我们开展批评与自我批评的力量。我们就在这一精神的指导下，召开了全市第一次党代表会议，认真地审查了我们的工作和党的状况，进一步发扬了党内民主，开展批评与自我批评，使全党对思想工作获得了新的认识。
    我们从检查上海党的状况中，更深切地体验到：
    “中国共产党应该用批评和自我批评的方法，经常检讨自己工作中的错误与缺点，来教育自己的党员和干部，并及时纠正自己的错误。中国共产党反对那种自高自大、害怕承认自己的错误、害怕批评与自我批评的情绪。”（中国共产党党章总纲规定）这是我们党的事业前进的力量。我们共产党和每一个共产党员在革命斗争过程中，要保证把工作办好，使革命事业前进，而不因犯错误使工作遭受损失，就依靠我们经常用批评和自我批评的方法，揭露在工作和思想中的各种缺点和错误，及时地予以纠正。这是我们工人阶级的共产主义的政党区别于其他政党的显著标帜之一。它表明我们党对于人民和革命事业的严肃的负责的态度。
    反党分子黄逸峰，完全违反党的这一根本原则，把自己放在反党反人民的地位，直接成为党的死敌。这就是党把黄逸峰清除出去的根本原因。党只有坚决地毫不妥协地把这种坏分子开除出党，才能更好地纯洁党的组织并使党日益巩固与强大起来。但是正如解放日报社论所指出：“黄逸峰那样的骗子在我们党内虽然没有合法地位，并已被驱逐出党，但是，类似黄逸峰那样的坏分子，类似黄逸峰那样的欺上压下的坏作风，并不是就此肃清了。”即以上海党的状况来说，仅仅在第一次党代表会议前后所揭发出来的各种大小坏事，已属惊人。其中最突出的如前江宁区委书记苏博，在任职期间，一贯对抗组织、闹独立性。他自以为对革命有功，而党没有给他更重要的职位，经常散布不满情绪，抗拒执行上级党的指示和决定。在区委会内部，实施家长式的领导，独断独行，任意决定或撤销工作部署，擅自委任干部，目无组织，为所欲为。闸北区委书记苏峰，政治思想蜕化，一贯以官僚主义态度对待自己所主持的工作，在党内实行家长式的领导。他的各项错误在党代表会议上被闸北区委代表揭发后，竟恼羞成怒地以要求退党向党威胁，甚至厚颜无耻地提出要党为他保守秘密，“不伤感情”。这种堕落蜕化分子的反党本质，在严肃的党的原则面前，就完全暴露无余。他们这种行为和反党分子黄逸峰的共同特点，就是“把自己所领导的单位当做独立王国而为所欲为、反抗党的领导和分裂党的极端危险的倾向。”他们正是有那种荒谬设想的人，“他们以为党终于要向他们妥协和屈服，而和他们成立谅解，不再去惹他们生气，因为他们是有地位有历史的党员，不能不另眼相看。”
    （人民日报社论）他们不理解党的事业是人民的事业，党的利益是以人民的利益为出发点的。任何企图利用党达到他们个人利益的自私自利分子，就必然要堕落到反党的地步，最后终于要像黄逸峰一样被清除出党。当然，苏峰、苏博这种坏分子，同黄逸峰一样在党内是没有合法地位的，也是极坏的典型，但类似这种危险的倾向，在我们上海党组织内不是个别的，正如陈毅同志所指出的，“而是有一批”。在某些单位担负领导工作的党员，也常有把个人利益放在党的利益之上，并使党的利益遭受了很大的损失。此外，在若干中、下层组织中也同样存在这种危险的倾向。少数坏分子篡夺领导职位，借假党和人民政府的名义，敲诈勒索，为非作歹，骑在人民头上，破坏党与人民的关系。这是值得我们上海全党和我们领导干部特别重视的。这些事件警告我们，经过“三反”、整党、和反官僚主义斗争，苏峰、苏博这类坏分子仍然能够僭居党的领导地位，未能及时地揭穿其堕落蜕化的本质，这也就同时暴露了我们党内的民主生活是不正常的。虽然对他们那种错误的行为，也曾作过一些批评和教育，甚至采取了组织的措施，如在“三反”期间把苏博调离原有的工作岗位，进行教育。如在“五反”期间苏峰向党作过检讨。但由于没有提到高度的纪律原则水平，“对于那些在当前工作中犯有严重罪恶，以及在历史上屡犯错误而屡教不改的不可救药的分子，党一定要坚决地把他们清除出去，以保持党的共产主义的纯洁性。”（人民日报社论）以致让这些坏分子利用党的“治病救人”的方针，作为他们掩盖错误欺骗组织的护身符。从这里，我们就更深刻地认识到改善党内和党外的民主的生活，改善党内的开展批评的教育和严守纪律的教育，改善党的思想工作和干部工作，在我们上海党内就成为迫切的任务了。
    最近全市党的第一次代表会议，根据中央反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的指示和华东局关于黄逸峰事件的决定，以及人民日报一月二十三日的社论“压制批评的人是党的死敌”所指示的精神，结合总结一九五二年的工作，充分发扬党内的民主，严肃地展开了批评与自我批评。各级领导和各个部门以及某些党员干部犯有各种不同程度的官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的倾向，普遍地得到揭发，特别是揭发和批判了苏峰、苏博等等反党分子的错误，并展开了严肃的斗争。由于这一斗争的初步胜利，使我们全党对于改善党内民主生活，改善党内的批评与自我批评，开展反对官僚主义，反对命令主义，反对违法乱纪的斗争，获得了一个新的良好的开端。但我们必须进一步指出：要使反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争获得深入的开展与彻底的胜利，其主要关键，就在首先反掉各级领导上所存在的各种不同形式的官僚主义，才有可能使斗争贯彻到底。上海党的组织必须通过这一斗争，来进一步加强党的组织性和纪律性，改善党的领导作风与工作方法，消除党内的消极的和不健康的现象，保持党的共产主义的纯洁性。
    应当指出：反对官僚主义、反对命令主义与反对违法乱纪的斗争，不能采取只求轰轰烈烈一阵的作法，而必须有领导有重点地同时由上而下地逐步深入展开，并在斗争达到一定目的之后迅即转入经常化。因此，上海党的组织必须根据市委的统一布置，密切结合各项工作，在各项工作中贯彻这一斗争。首先传达第一次党代表会议的精神，组织全体党员干部学习有关文件，提高全体党员的政治觉悟与思想水平，克服对坏人坏事采取调和姑息的自由主义态度；打破各种思想障碍，正确地掌握方针政策；其次根据不同情况，从处理已经暴露的问题，从有重点地检查与总结工作，或从检查处理人民来信入手，深入展开这一斗争。这一斗争应首先从市区两级机关团体开展起来，然后再有计划地逐步贯彻到基层单位中去；并且在贯彻这一斗争中，必须以实事求是的态度认真执行，反对任何粗枝大叶的官僚主义做法。只有这样，才可以使这一斗争更加深入、持久、彻底；才能肃清旧社会所遗留的恶劣的官僚主义和国民党作风，才能更好地巩固党与人民的联系，才能更有效地保证国家计划的胜利完成。
    我们深信：在毛主席和我们党中央以及华东局的领导之下，胜利一定属于我们！同志们！团结起来，为保持党的共产主义的纯洁性而斗争。
