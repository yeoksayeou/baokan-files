    Maple Wood Can Be Used to Replace Elm in Furniture Making
    Li Zuomin writes: Currently, the general practice is to use elm wood to make furniture; however, elm is scarce in many places, so furniture manufacturers search for it in other regions. This not only causes market fluctuations in other areas but also wastes a lot of manpower and resources. To solve this problem, I suggest using maple wood instead of elm. Maple and elm are both hardwoods. Except for the lack of grain, maple has the same properties as elm, and it is smooth and delicate, making it very suitable for furniture making. In order to save wood and benefit the country's large-scale economic construction, I hope this method will be adopted by everyone.
        Reply from the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering
    Reader Li Zuomin's suggestion is very good. 栬木 (Nuò mù) is also known as 色木 (Sè mù), 槭木 (Qī mù) or 枫木 (Fēng mù), and is mostly produced in the northeastern provinces. The wood is strong, heavy, and hard, with fine grain and luster, and is easy to work with, but it has irregular cracks. In the current situation where elm is relatively scarce, it is a good idea to use maple as a substitute for furniture and fine woodwork. The Ministry will notify construction material companies in various regions to pay attention to its adoption, and hopes that you will introduce and promote it to everyone.

### 可用栬木代替洋榆制做家具

专栏：读者来信摘要

    可用栬木代替洋榆制做家具
    李作民来信：目前一般习惯多以洋榆制做家具；而很多地方洋榆缺少，家具制造商就到外地搜购。这样不但造成外地市场波动，也浪费了很多人力物力。为了解决这个问题，建议用栬木代洋榆。栬木和洋榆都是硬杂木。栬木除去没有花纹外，性质完全和洋榆一样，且平滑细腻，很适于做家具。为了节约木材，以利于国家大规模经济建设，希望这个办法被大家采用。
        中央建筑工程部的答复
    读者李作民的建议很好。栬木即色木，又名槭木或枫木，多产于东北各省。木质坚重且硬，纹理细密光泽，施工较易，但有不规则裂隙。在目前洋榆较缺的情况下，以栬木来代用作家具及细工材是很好的。本部即通知各地建筑器材公司注意采用，并希你们向大家介绍推广。
