    All Design Personnel of the East China Construction Engineering Bureau Design Company
    Go Deep into the Field to Inspect Engineering Design Work
    [Report from this newspaper] The Design Company of the East China Construction Engineering Bureau, drawing on the experience of Northeast China and Tianjin, mobilized its employees to inspect the engineering design work of 1952. Through the inspection and criticism of conservative and backward design thinking, the level of design work was improved. This inspection has now achieved very good results.
    In January of this year, the Culture and Education Design Office of the company, in order to do a good job in the standard design of schools for 1953, inspected two school projects and found many design errors. This matter attracted the attention of the company's leadership. At this time, this newspaper published an editorial entitled "Oppose Conservative and Backward Thinking in Design" and the experience of Tianjin in inspecting engineering design. The editorial called on design departments in various places to conduct a general inspection of design projects to establish advanced design thinking and improve the level of design work. Therefore, the leading cadres of the design company decided to carry out this work throughout the company. At the beginning, many technical personnel had concerns. Some were afraid of being held responsible after errors were found in the inspection; senior engineers were afraid of "losing face" after errors were found; some did not pay attention to the inspection and thought that the inspection was unreasonable; some held a perfunctory attitude and only prepared to stroll around the construction site. In order to eliminate everyone's concerns, the leading cadres organized all personnel to study several editorials in this newspaper, such as "Oppose Conservative and Backward Thinking in Design," and the experience of Tianjin and other places in inspecting engineering design, and put forward the guiding principle of this inspection of engineering design: expose shortcomings, learn lessons, affirm experience, and improve design work, so that everyone could initially unify their thinking. At this time, other preparatory work was actively carried out, various materials useful for inspecting design work were collected, an inspection outline was formulated, and twelve projects to be inspected were determined. On February 10, more than 300 technical personnel set off in groups to inspect.
    During the inspection, each group prepared to hold forums with owners and construction personnel to widely listen to the opinions of the masses. When they inspected the East China Accelerated Experimental Middle School and the Caoyang New Village Kindergarten project, they invited representatives of the principal, teachers, workers, and students to participate in the forum. At the meeting, everyone put forward 73 opinions, exposing many serious problems in the design. For example, the designers lacked economic accounting thinking. When designing the school buildings of the Experimental Middle School, they did not conduct soil tests. When the project was halfway through, they discovered that the soil quality was not good, so they drove a large number of foundation piles to remedy it, resulting in a waste of 2.5 billion yuan, accounting for one-seventh of the total amount required to build the school buildings. One teacher said painfully: "This 2.5 billion yuan could have built a decent primary school, but now this primary school has been buried underground." Due to the poor coordination between construction and installation work, when the school buildings of the Experimental Middle School were completed, the water pipes and wires were not yet installed, so the new walls had to be pierced, and even the steel bars had to be chiseled off. The forum also listed many unreasonable designs. For example, the urinals in the kindergarten were designed according to the height of adults, making it difficult for children to climb up. The teachers said, "The children seem to be urinating on the wall." However, the classrooms of the Experimental Middle School, which mainly trains worker and peasant cadres, were arranged according to the standards of primary school students. As a result, college students could not sit down at the small desks, and they could not stand up after squeezing in. Every time class started and ended, the desks and chairs in the classroom were pushed into a mess. When they inspected the Shanghai Municipal Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital (i.e., Chengzhong Sanatorium), they invited the president, doctors, nurses, and administrative staff to participate in the forum, which also revealed dozens of facts of improper layout and design errors. For example, the designers discharged the hospital's sewage into a small river used by nearby residents to wash rice and vegetables. The designers simply pursued formal beauty and designed the through hall of the operating room into a polygonal shape. The door of the operating room was opened obliquely, so that the patient had to turn several corners when being carried to the operating table, increasing the patient's pain.
    The purpose of this inspection by the design company is to do a good job in this year's engineering design work. Therefore, the division of labor during the inspection was completely determined according to the business that each person was responsible for. Those who will design factories in the future will specialize in inspecting factories; those who will design residences in the future will specialize in inspecting residences; those who do structures will inspect structures, and those who do construction will inspect construction. This approach, which is closely integrated with future work tasks, allows the experience and lessons learned in this inspection to be immediately applied to work. Some designers have already begun to revise the shortcomings on the original design drawings.
    The on-site inspection of the design company ended on February 13. Now, they are conducting heated discussions from the bottom up in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, making summaries at each level, and are studying and formulating various responsibility systems and other necessary systems in design work to consolidate the inspection results.

    华东建筑工程局设计公司全体设计人员
    深入现场检查工程设计工作
    【本报讯】华东建筑工程局设计公司吸取东北、天津等地经验，发动职工群众，检查一九五二年工程设计工作，通过检查批判保守落后的设计思想，提高设计工作水平。现在这一检查已收到了很好的效果。
    在今年一月间，该公司文教设计室为了做好一九五三年的学校标准设计，检查了两个学校工程，发现了许多设计上的错误，这件事引起了公司领导上的重视。正在这时，本报发表了“反对设计中的保守落后思想”的社论，和天津检查工程设计的经验。社论中号召各地设计部门普遍进行设计工程检查，来确立先进的设计思想，提高设计工作水平。于是设计公司领导干部便决定在全公司开展这一工作。开始时，技术人员有不少顾虑，有的害怕检查出错误后追查责任；资历老的工程师怕检查出错误后“失面子”；有的不重视检查，认为检查没有什么道理；有的人抱着敷衍塞责的态度，只准备到工地去逛一逛。为了消除大家的顾虑，当时领导干部便组织全体人员学习了本报“反对设计中的保守落后思想”等几篇社论和天津等地的检查工程设计经验，并提出这次检查工程设计的方针是：暴露缺点，接受教训，肯定经验，改进设计工作，使大家在思想上初步统一起来。这时又积极进行了其他准备工作，搜集了各种对检查设计工作有用的资料，拟订了检查提纲，确定了十二个要检查的工程。二月十日，三百余名技术人员便分组出发检查了。
    在检查中，各组都有准备地分别召开业主与施工人员座谈会，广泛听取群众意见。他们在检查华东速成实验中学和曹扬新村幼儿园工程时，邀请了校长、教员、工友、学生代表等座谈，会上大家提出了七十三条意见，揭发了设计上许多严重问题。如设计人员缺乏经济核算思想，在设计实验中学的校舍时，没有进行土壤试验，等到工程进行了一半，才发现土质不好，便又打大量基桩来补救，结果浪费了二十五亿元，占建造校舍所需总额的七分之一。一个教师沉痛地说：“这二十五亿元本来可以造一座很像样的小学，现在这座小学就这样被埋到地下去了。”由于建筑与安装工作配合不好，实验中学的校舍建筑完成时，水管电线还未安装，只好将新墙壁打穿，甚至连钢筋也得凿断。座谈会上还列举了许多设计上不合理的地方，例如幼儿园的小便池是按照成人的高度设计的，幼儿们爬上去很困难，教师们说：“孩子们好像爬在围墙上小便。”但是以工农干部为主要培养对象的实验中学课堂，又一切按照小学生的标准来安排，结果小课桌坐不下大学生，勉强挤下去又站不起来，每次上下课，课室里桌椅都被推挤得乱七八糟。他们在检查上海市立肺结核防治院（即澄衷疗养院）时，邀请院长、医生、护士和行政事务人员座谈，也揭发了数十条布局不当、设计错误等事实。如设计者把医院污水排泄到附近居民都用来淘米洗菜的小河里。设计者单纯追求形式上的美观，把手术室穿堂设计成一个多角形的，手术室的门斜开着，以致把病人抬上手术台，要转几个弯，增加了病人的痛苦。
    该设计公司这次检查的目的是为了做好今年的工程设计工作。因此，检查时的分工，完全按照各人所担任的业务来确定。如今后要设计工厂的，就专门检查工厂；今后要设计住宅的，就专门检查住宅；做结构的检查结构，做建筑的检查建筑。这样紧紧与今后工作任务结合的做法，使得在这次检查中得到的经验和教训，就可以立刻运用到工作中去。现在部分设计人员已在开始修正原来设计图上的缺点。
    该设计公司的实地检查已于二月十三日结束，现在他们正自下而上地以批评与自我批评的精神展开热烈讨论，按级作出总结，并正研究制订设计工作上的各种责任制和其他必要制度，把检查成绩巩固下来。
