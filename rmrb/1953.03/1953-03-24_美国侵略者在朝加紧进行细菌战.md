Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 23rd: The American aggressors are intensifying their criminal germ warfare against the northern half of Korea, taking advantage of the arrival of spring. According to the Korean Central News Agency: preliminary statistics show that from January to mid-March this year, enemy aircraft dropped large quantities of insects and items carrying various infectious germs on Pyongyang, Wonsan, Kaesong, and areas in Kangwon Province, South Hamgyong Province, Jagang Province, South Pyongan Province, and Hwanghae Province, over sixty times.

On January 6th, enemy aircraft dropped germ-carrying insects such as flies, mosquitoes, and spiders in the Sindong-ri area (transliteration) of Huaiyang County, Kangwon Province. On January 9th, enemy aircraft dropped germ-carrying insects such as spiders and small beetles in the Janghang-ri area of Hyesan County, South Hamgyong Province, with a density of about 20,000 insects per square meter. On January 10th in the Wanpung-ri area (transliteration) of Wonsan City, on January 17th in the Beobdong-eup (transliteration) of Munchon County, Kangwon Province, and Yangpung-ri (transliteration) of Yonghung County, South Hamgyong Province, and around January 20th in the Sangsu-ri area (transliteration) of Wonsan City, Kosan County and Yongbok-ri (transliteration) of Kangwon Province, Miam-ri in the Seoguyok district of Pyongyang, Yongheung-ri of Yongheung County, South Hamgyong Province, and Kowon-eup of Kowon County, Kangwon Province, enemy aircraft also dropped large quantities of similar germ-carrying insects. Among them, in the Beobdong-eup area of Munchon County, Kangwon Province, enemy aircraft scattered hundreds of thousands of germ-carrying insects such as flies, small beetles, ants, and spiders over an area of 61,000 square meters.

In the ten days after February 2nd, groups of US B-29 bombers and fighter-bombers attacked Sangja-ri of Sinsang County, Hamhung City, Buwon-ri (transliteration) of Hamhung City, Suchang-ri (transliteration) of Kaesong City, Yero-ri of Eunpa County, Hwanghae Province, and Bonghwang-ri (transliteration) of Sunchon County, South Pyongan Province, dropping large quantities of rats, flies, cabbage worms, etc., packaged in paper and tinfoil bags.

Since March, the enemy has further expanded its germ warfare atrocities. On March 1st, enemy aircraft dropped large quantities of flies, mosquitoes, and other insects and small mollusks carrying infectious germs in the Wiwon-eup area of Wiwon County, Jagang Province, and the Cheolbong-ri area (transliteration) of Anbyon County, Kangwon Province. From March 11th to 13th, enemy aircraft dropped the same insects in Kirin-ri, Rangnang-ri, and Yongseong-ri of Daedong County, Pyongyang. According to incomplete statistics, enemy aircraft scattered germ-carrying insects in various parts of northern Korea a total of twenty-seven times in the first half of March.

In addition to dropping various germ-carrying insects and other small animals, enemy aircraft also maliciously dropped various items carrying infectious germs. For example, on March 10th, enemy aircraft dropped biscuits and other food items carrying infectious germs in three "ri" in Hamhung City, eight "ri" in Sinchang County, South Hamgyong Province, and nineteen "ri" in Bukchong County, attempting to lure children to eat them.

    美国侵略者在朝加紧进行细菌战
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】美国侵略者正利用春季到来的时候，对朝鲜北半部地区加紧进行罪恶的细菌战。据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：初步统计，从今年一月到三月中旬，敌机在平壤、元山、开城及江原道、咸镜南道、慈江道、平安南道、黄海道等地，接连六十多次投下大量带有各种传染病菌的昆虫和物品。
    一月六日，敌机在江原道淮阳郡新东里（译音）一带投下了苍蝇、蚊子、蜘蛛等带菌虫子。一月九日，敌机在咸镜南道惠山郡獐项里一带，投下了蜘蛛、小甲虫等带菌虫子，这些虫子分布的密度是每平方公尺约有二万只。一月十日在元山市万丰里
    （译音）地区，一月十七日在江原道文川郡法洞邑（译音）和咸镜南道永兴郡阳凤里（译音），一月二十日前后在元山市上水里（译音）、江原道高山郡、龙福里（译音）、平壤市西区嵋岩里、咸镜南道永兴郡龙兴里和江原道高原郡高原邑等地，敌机也投下了大量同类的带菌昆虫。其中，敌机在江原道文川郡法洞邑一带，在六万一千平方公尺的地区里，撒布了数十万只苍蝇、小甲虫、蚂蚁等带菌昆虫和蜘蛛。
    在二月二日以后的十天中，美军B—二九型轰炸机和战斗轰炸机机群袭击了咸镜南道新上郡上子里、咸兴市富源里（译音）、开城市水昌里（译音）、黄海道银波郡礼老里、平安南道顺川郡凤凰里（译音）等地，投下大量用纸袋和锡纸包装的老鼠、苍蝇、白菜虫等。
    三月以来，敌人又进一步扩大细菌战暴行。三月一日，敌机在慈江道渭原郡渭原邑一带和江原道安边郡铁峰里（译音）一带投下大量苍蝇、蚊子等带有传染病菌的昆虫及软体小动物。从三月十一日到十三日的三天中，敌机又在平壤市麒麟里、乐浪里、大同郡龙城里等地投下了同样的昆虫。据不完全统计，敌机在三月上半月共向朝鲜北半部各地撒布了二十七次带菌虫子。
    敌机除了投掷各种带菌昆虫和其他小动物之外，还恶毒地投下各种带有传染病菌的物品。例如，三月十日，敌机在咸兴市的三个里、咸镜南道新昌郡的八个里及北青郡的十九个里，在投下各种带菌昆虫的同时，投下带有传染病菌的饼干之类的食品，企图诱惑儿童们去取食。
