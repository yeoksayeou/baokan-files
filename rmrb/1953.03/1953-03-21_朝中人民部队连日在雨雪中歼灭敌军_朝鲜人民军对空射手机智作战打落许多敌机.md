Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 20th: From March 12th to 16th, the weather on the Korean front was unpredictable, with alternating rain and snow. The Korean and Chinese People's Forces annihilated enemy troops in the continuous rain and snow.

	On the western front, on the night of the 14th, near Deoksan-ri, west of Munsan, our forces completely annihilated two squads of the ROK Marine Corps 1st Regiment that entered our ambush zone.

	On the eastern front, late at night on the 15th, a night raiding team of our forces suddenly pounced on an enemy position near Gachilbong, west of Mundeung-ri, and annihilated seventeen enemy soldiers of the Philippine Battalion.

	On the central front, at approximately 1:00 AM on the 16th, our forces attacked the position of a platoon of the ROK 9th Division near Geumgok-ri, northwest of Gimhwa. From the time of the assault on the position to the end of the battle, it only took fourteen minutes to completely annihilate all forty-plus enemy defenders.

	During these five days, our frontline mobile artillery killed or wounded a total of 431 enemy soldiers; frontline anti-aircraft artillery shot down four enemy planes and damaged eleven.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: The Korean People's Army anti-aircraft gunners defending the coastal areas, bravely and skillfully fought against enemy planes, and recently shot down many more.

	On the morning of February 21st, a formation of enemy planes flew in from the sea and indiscriminately bombed a peaceful village not far from the coast. This angered the gunners of the Kim Chang-ha anti-aircraft gun group stationed near the village. They immediately organized fire to shoot at the enemy planes. The enemy planes then shifted their target, frantically diving and bombing the anti-aircraft gunners' positions and strafing. Machine gunner and member of the Korean Democratic Youth League, Guo Zhongjun, was injured in the leg by stones thrown up by a bomb, but he and other gunners persisted in the fight. When the enemy planes dived for the second time, they all opened fire together, forming a tight net of fire in the air. A burst of bullets fired fiercely by Guo Zhongjun shot down the leading diving enemy plane, frightening the remaining enemy planes into fleeing. That afternoon and the following morning, two more batches of enemy planes came to attack their position. The heroic gunners fought with full confidence and shot down two more enemy planes.

	In order to improve the hit rate, the Li Yong-cheon anti-aircraft gun group, operating in a certain coastal area, improved the method of adjusting the distance of anti-aircraft machine guns and deployed mobile firepower according to the terrain and the laws of enemy aircraft movement. As a result, they recently shot down two enemy planes in quick succession within a few tens of minutes in fierce battles with several enemy aircraft formations.

	Heroic gunners from other units also achieved victories. The Wu Yun-xie anti-aircraft machine gun platoon shot down two enemy planes on February 26th and 28th. Anti-aircraft gunners of the Kim Tae-geun unit shot down eleven enemy planes in eight days.

    朝鲜人民军对空射手机智作战打落许多敌机
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】三月十二日到十六日，朝鲜前线天气阴晴不定，时雨时雪，朝中人民军队连日在雨雪中歼灭敌军。
    在西线，十四日夜，我军在汶山以西德山里附近，将进入我军伏击圈内的李伪军海军陆战第一团的两个班全部歼灭。
    在东线，十五日深夜，我军一支夜袭队突然扑上文登里以西加七峰附近的一个敌军阵地，歼灭菲律宾营敌兵十七名。
    在中线，十六日一时许，我军袭击金化西北金谷里附近李伪军第九师一个排的阵地，从攻上阵地到战斗结束仅经十四分钟，就把四十多名守敌全部歼灭。
    这五天中，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军四百三十一名；前线高射炮火共击落敌机四架，击伤敌机十一架。
    【新华社平壤讯】防守海岸地区的朝鲜人民军对空射手们，英勇机智地和敌机作战，最近又打落了许多敌机。
    二月二十一日上午，敌机编队从海上飞来，向离海岸不远的一个和平村庄滥炸。这激怒了驻防在村庄附近的金昌河对空射击组的射手们，他们立即组织火力射击敌机。敌机这时就转移目标，忙乱地向对空射手们的阵地俯冲投弹，并进行扫射。机枪射手、朝鲜民主青年同盟盟员郭锺钧被炸弹炸起的石块打伤了腿，但是他和其他射手们一起坚持战斗。当敌机第二次俯冲时，他们一起开枪，在空中构成了严密的火网。郭锺钧猛烈地射出的一串子弹，把领头俯冲的敌长机打落在地，吓得其余的敌机腾空就跑。在当天下午和第二天早晨，又有两批敌机来袭击他们的阵地。英勇的射手们信心百倍地作战，又先后打落了敌机两架。
    为了提高命中率，在某海岸地区作战的李容天对空射击组，改进了调整高射机枪距离的方法，并根据地形和敌机行动的规律，布置了机动火力。因而，他们最近在和好几个敌机编队的激战中，在几十分钟内，就接连打落敌机两架。
    其他部队的英雄射手们也取得了胜利。吴允爕高射机枪区分队在二月二十六、二十八日两天中打落了敌机两架。金泰根部队的对空射手们在八天中打落了敌机十一架。
