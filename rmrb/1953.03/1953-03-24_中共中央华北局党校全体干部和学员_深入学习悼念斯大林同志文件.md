The entire cadre and student body of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Party School are responding to Chairman Mao's call to transform grief into strength and are wholeheartedly engaged in deeply studying the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin.

Even before the Central Committee's study notice was issued, many comrades had already spontaneously begun studying Chairman Mao's "The Greatest Friendship" and Malenkov's speech at the memorial service. Many comrades were engrossed in reading "A Brief Biography of Stalin." Some comrades, although they had read this book many times, felt it was particularly intimate and profound today. Liu Tiehan of the Supply Section read excitedly until 3:00 AM the night he heard the unfortunate news of Comrade Stalin's death. On March 11, after the school heard the Central Committee's study notice broadcast on the Central People's Broadcasting Station and received instructions from the North China Bureau Propaganda Department, it immediately arranged study tasks. All comrades recognized the urgent significance of studying these historic documents. Many comrades said: We are ashamed that we did not study Comrade Stalin's works well in the past and did not fully appreciate Comrade Stalin's greatness. This time, we must work doubly hard to study. The students successively proposed guarantees in patriotic covenants and individual study plans, determined to study these documents well and use practical actions to mourn Comrade Stalin. A craze for buying documents and books was formed. Chen Boda's "Stalin and the Chinese Revolution" as well as "Foundations of Leninism," Lenin and Stalin's "On China," and the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union became the most beloved reference books for everyone. Late at night, on Sundays, and at all other times that could be used for studying, there were always many comrades in the school who were intently studying the documents.

At study group seminars, each comrade spoke movingly about their understanding of Comrade Stalin and the ideological activities triggered by Comrade Stalin's unfortunate death. Everyone unanimously said: The great achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union today are inseparable from the name of Comrade Stalin. Without the assistance of the Soviet Union, the victory of the Chinese revolution would be unimaginable. Many comrades spoke with infinite gratitude about Comrade Stalin's profound friendship with the Chinese people. For example, some comrades recalled the great care and material support that Comrade Stalin gave to our country during the most difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War; the vast majority of comrades were even more grateful for the enormous help that the Soviet experts dispatched by Comrade Stalin had given to our economic construction over the past three years. Sun Liang of the Party History Teaching and Research Section, recalling the process of his own ideological progress, said: "It was Comrade Stalin who gave me the truth, taught me to progress, and made me understand how to live."

In this study, everyone further recognized the importance of strengthening unity, which was repeatedly emphasized in the documents, and firmly believed that the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union was as solid as steel. Many comrades said: The reports of Comrade Malenkov and others, as well as Chairman Mao's articles, have given us strength and confidence. As long as we are united, we will have great strength and will not be afraid of imperialism taking advantage of loopholes. On March 16, the People's Daily published the news of the fourth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. When everyone saw the unity shown between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Malenkov and the Soviet people, their confidence was strengthened. Some comrades' anxieties caused by Comrade Stalin's death have now also been cleared up. Everyone expressed that they would unite more closely around the Communist Party and struggle to continue Comrade Stalin's cause.

At present, the school is continuing to study in depth. On the afternoon of the 17th, Qin Renshan, Director of the Political Economics Teaching and Research Section, introduced to all comrades Comrade Stalin's main contributions to the world communist movement and to the Chinese revolution. On the morning of the 19th, Zhao Zhengfu, Secretary of the Party Committee, explained the important significance of strengthening Sino-Soviet unity. In order to understand more specifically and comprehensively Comrade Stalin's great contributions in the field of theoretical activity, the comrades asked the school to issue more handouts, print more materials, and give more reports.

To cooperate with the study, the school screened the film "The Vow." After watching the film, the comrades said: The oath made by Comrade Stalin after Lenin's death has now been completely fulfilled.

    中共中央华北局党校全体干部和学员
    深入学习悼念斯大林同志文件
    中共中央华北局党校全体干部、学员，响应毛主席把悲痛化为力量的号召，正在全神贯注地深入学习悼念斯大林同志的文件。
    在中央学习通知尚未发布前，许多同志已自动开始学习毛主席的“最伟大的友谊”及马林科夫在追悼会上讲话等文件，不少同志手不释卷地读着“斯大林传略”，有的同志对这本书虽已读了好多遍，但今天读起来反而特别感到亲切、深刻。供给科刘铁汉同志当听到斯大林同志逝世不幸消息的那个晚上，激动地读到午夜三时。三月十一日，该校从中央人民广播电台的广播中听到中央所发布的学习通知，并接到华北局宣传部的指示后，立即布置了学习任务。全体同志都认识到学习这些历史性文件的迫切意义。许多同志都说：我们惭愧的是过去没有好好学习斯大林同志的著作，对斯大林同志的伟大体会得非常不够，这次学习要加倍努力。学员们纷纷在爱国公约及个人学习计划中提出保证，决心学好这些文件，用实际行动来追悼斯大林同志。买文件、买书籍形成了热潮，陈伯达同志的“斯大林与中国革命”以及“论列宁主义基础”、列宁斯大林“论中国”、苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件等成为大家最热爱的参考书。在深夜，在星期日，在其他一切可以利用来学习的时间，学校中总有不少同志在聚精会神地钻研文件。
    在学习小组座谈会上，每个同志都很感动地叙说自己对斯大林同志的认识以及由斯大林同志不幸逝世而引起的思想活动。大家一致说：苏联今天社会主义建设的伟大成就是和斯大林同志的名字分不开的。没有苏联的援助，中国革命的胜利是不能想像的。许多同志怀着无限感激的心情谈论斯大林同志对于中国人民的深厚友谊。如有的同志回忆在抗日战争最艰苦的年月中，斯大林同志所给予我国最大的关怀和物质上的支援；绝大多数同志更是感激斯大林同志三年来所派遣的苏联专家对我国经济建设的莫大帮助。党史教研室孙梁同志回想自己思想进步的过程说：“是斯大林同志给我真理，教导我进步，使我懂得了如何生活的。”
    在这次学习中，大家都进一步认识到文件中所再三强调的加强团结的重要意义，深信以苏联为首的和平民主阵营是钢铁般的坚固。许多同志说：马林科夫等同志的报告及毛主席的文章给了我们力量和信心，只要我们团结一致，就有伟大的力量，不怕帝国主义钻空子。三月十六日，人民日报发表了苏联最高苏维埃举行第四次会议的消息。当大家看到以马林科夫同志为首的苏联共产党和苏联人民之间所表现的团结一致，更加强了信心。有些同志在斯大林同志逝世时所引起的焦虑情绪现在也清除了。大家表示，要更紧密地团结在共产党的周围，为继续完成斯大林的事业而斗争。
    目前该校仍在继续深入学习。十七日下午由政治经济学教研室主任秦仁山同志向全体同志介绍斯大林同志对世界共产主义运动和对中国革命的主要贡献。十九日早晨，由党委书记赵征夫同志讲解加强中苏团结的重要意义。为了更具体地更全面地了解斯大林同志在理论活动方面的伟大贡献，同志们要求校方多发讲义，多印资料，多作报告。
    为了配合学习，该校放映了“宣誓”影片。看完影片，同志们说：斯大林同志在列宁逝世后所作的宣誓，现在是完全实现了。
