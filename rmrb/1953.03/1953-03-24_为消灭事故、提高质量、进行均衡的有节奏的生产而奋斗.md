    In 1952, state-owned industries in the Northeast region victoriously completed their production tasks and increased production and economization plans. However, some leading cadres in factories and mines lacked sufficient understanding of comprehensively fulfilling the various indicators stipulated by the state and conducting production in a balanced and safe manner. Therefore, there are still many shortcomings in production that urgently need to be overcome by mobilizing employees in conjunction with discussions on the 1953 state plan.
    Currently, there are three common and serious problems in industrial production: The first problem is unsafe production. For example, in the power industry system, the number of accidents in 1952 increased by 13.5 percent compared to 1951, and most were major accidents caused by negligence. Among these, there were as many as eighteen major equipment damage and major power outage accidents. On the high-voltage user side, the Shuangyashan Coal Mine experienced 121 power tripping accidents in 24 days due to unsound operating systems and imperfect starting equipment. In the coal mining sector, the worker casualty rate increased by 20 percent compared to 1951. The non-ferrous metal industry also saw an increase in mechanical and personal accidents compared to 1951. In the chemical industry, many employees suffer from poisoning and occupational diseases. The reasons for the increase in accidents can be summarized as follows: (1) Leaders have failed to implement the concept of safe production among the masses, so accidents often occur due to violations of operating procedures and labor discipline. For example, in the power industry system, patrol workers in Harbin, due to difficult road conditions, did not patrol along the lines but took detours on the main roads, leading to a subsequent wire break accident. Workers at the Third Paper Mill, in order to rush tasks, privately increased the speed of paper copying, resulting in the breaking of the paper copying machine shaft and belt, stopping production for approximately forty hours on two occasions. (2) The inspection and maintenance of equipment is not well done. (3) Production is unbalanced, slack at the beginning and tight at the end, with rush production. In the Non-Ferrous Metals Administration, from 1950 to 1952, the average proportion of accidents per month was 24 percent in the first ten days, 36 percent in the middle ten days, and 40 percent in the last ten days. In 1952, the number of coal mine casualty accidents occurring in the last ten days was even higher than in the first and middle ten days. This shows that the increase in accidents is directly related to rush production.
    The second problem is poor quality and too many rejects. Some industrial sectors violate the national quality standards, manufacturing substandard goods that do not meet the prescribed standards and technical conditions for consumers. For example, the quality of the Hongqi brand automobile tires produced by the Rubber Bureau was relatively good in 1951, but gradually declined in 1952. According to the Highway Bureau, this batch of products is not wear-resistant. Standard products can travel 20,000 kilometers, while these products can travel only 9,000 kilometers at most and only 5,000 kilometers at least, with the tread rubber wearing out and exposing the cord fabric layer. Moreover, the tread rubber is easily separated from the tire body, "losing its pants" after only a few hundred kilometers. The tire body's pressure resistance is insufficient, making it prone to bursting. The rubber shoes produced by the Rubber Bureau factories are not only outdated in style, but also easily come unglued, and the midsoles are brittle, which has aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Although the quality of machinery manufacturing has improved, the rejection rate of certain parts remains very high. The rejection rates of the large drawbar and copper tile of the 400-kilowatt air hammer at the Second Machinery Factory are both above 60 percent. The poor quality of products not only directly and indirectly causes huge economic losses to the country but also casts a negative impact on the reputation of state-owned products. The reasons for the poor product quality are, first and foremost, that production units, from leaders to employees, generally have a mindset that emphasizes quantity over quality and lack the concept of comprehensively fulfilling the national plan. The Rubber No. 8 Factory produced cotton rubber shoes in the third quarter of 1952 that did not meet quality standards from the beginning, but the leaders turned a blind eye, did not seek to improve, and produced substandard products for an entire quarter. Secondly, technical management is lax, and the technical inspection system is not strict, so the quality of semi-finished or finished products cannot be controlled. In some units, the leaders did not provide strong support to the technical inspection department, so the technical inspection department did not play its due role in urging the workshops to complete the quality plan, and unqualified finished products were shipped out as qualified products. Previously, the rubber shoe factory only conducted spot checks every few days, and it was impossible to hold anyone accountable or investigate the reasons for the unqualified products. Thirdly, the use of the preferential pricing policy for certain high-quality products is not well done. Taking the coal mining industry as an example, except for special-purpose coal, the prices are not differentiated according to quality, giving production units the idea that "good and bad coal sell for the same price." Fourthly, the poor quality of some products is due to the poor quality of raw materials. For example, poor steel affects the quality of machinery, poor electric furnace steel affects the quality of ball bearings, and poor carbon black and cotton yarn affect the quality of automobile tires.
    The third problem is unbalanced production. Most industrial sectors in the Northeast have the phenomenon of being slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end, and slack at the beginning of the year and tight at the end. For example, for the electric motors manufactured by the factories under the Electric Engineering Bureau, taking the number of units produced in the last ten days of each month as 100, the figure for the first ten days of August was 12.7, and for the first ten days of October was 17.2. In terms of papermaking, various types of paper and pulp failed to meet their targets for three consecutive quarters last year, so in the fourth quarter, they had to use a quarter of the time to complete one-third of the unfinished tasks for the whole year. In the food industry sector, the processing of wheat and soybeans has historically been a rush in the first and fourth quarters and idle in the second and third quarters, with factories shutting down for three to five months each year. For soybean processing alone, the loss of oil extraction rate amounted to 138 billion yuan, and the loss of wage payments during shutdowns amounted to 15 billion yuan. Due to unbalanced production, a series of difficulties have arisen, causing great losses to the country. For example, when workers are laid off at the beginning of the month and equipment is idle, non-production expenses increase. By the end of the month, overtime work is required, which not only harms workers' health and increases mechanical accidents but also easily fosters habits such as violating operating procedures and neglecting product quality among employees. Moreover, it causes periodic fluctuations in transportation, power supply, material supply, warehouse management, and capital turnover.
    Now that the country's first Five-Year Plan has begun, the production tasks for 1953 are much more arduous than those for 1952. If we cannot face up to the above-mentioned shortcomings and take effective measures to correct them, it will bring great harm to this year's production. Therefore, it is necessary to educate employees on comprehensively fulfilling state tasks and strengthen ideological education on safe production and quality. And do the following work well:
    In order to eliminate accidents and ensure safe production, it is necessary to: 1. Improve safety equipment. Coal mines should use water-powered fans and add rock dust shelves and explosion-proof electrical equipment to prevent gas and coal dust explosions. The iron and steel industry should use Soviet-style high-temperature work shoes. Safety belts should be used for high-altitude operations. Chemical workers should wear protective clothing and gas masks. The textile industry should add indoor ventilation devices to reduce indoor temperatures. 2. Strictly implement security systems. New and old workers should undergo security procedure education when changing jobs and can only be assigned work after passing the examination. 3. Strengthen the inspection and maintenance of equipment. Strictly inspect mechanical equipment, and those who fail to inspect thoroughly and those who fail to repair properly should be held accountable and dealt with in a timely manner. And promote rapid maintenance to improve the quality and speed of maintenance.
    In order to improve product quality, 1. The factory director should be responsible for the quality situation. If the quality does not meet the national indicators, the bureau should order the temporary suspension of production and urge the factory to work hard to improve quality. Products that do not meet the national indicators cannot be sold as qualified products. 2. The bureau should establish a specialized agency to study people's needs to improve quality, increase variety, and improve styles by holding user seminars, conducting on-the-spot investigations, and producing in accordance with the specifications and proportions required by the market. 3. Strengthen technical management, strictly inspect the system, and conduct inspections at all levels. The bureau should establish a technical inspection department to lead the technical inspection work of each factory. 4. Establish a quality telegram system to keep abreast of the product quality of each factory in a timely manner. 5. Organize technicians, production managers, and veteran technicians to visit factories in Guannei. For example, the rubber industry organized a visiting group to study at the North China Rubber Factory, and after returning, they summarized and promoted the technologies and experiences they learned. The rubber industry has begun to pay attention to quality issues, and we suggest that another exhibition of defective and substandard rubber products be held for a tour and that employees be mobilized to discuss it and implement user supervision to quickly overcome these phenomena that violate national interests.
    According to existing experience, those who have achieved preliminary results in balanced production have mostly carried out the following tasks: 1. Rationally adjust the labor organization. One is scientific machine assignment, staffing, and specialization of labor division, and the other is a joint group, which complements each other. For individuals, emphasis should be placed on professional division of labor, the finer and more specialized the division of labor, the higher the efficiency; for groups, work sections, and workshops, in conjunction with the principle of division of labor, emphasis should be placed on joint production according to product specialty, so that management and contact are convenient, and scheduling is flexible. Therefore, we must continue to promote experience in this area. 2. Strengthen work planning and organization, carefully calculate the production process, and correctly and promptly issue tasks to workshops, groups, and even individuals on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis, and complete the progress on a daily basis according to variety, specifications, and quality. The work of each department, such as the planned maintenance of equipment and the preparations before maintenance, the timely supply of materials and tools, maintaining a certain amount of reserves, and the organization of patriotic competitions by trade unions, must be closely coordinated with this. 3. Strengthen production preparation work and strengthen inspection work. The Non-Ferrous Metals Administration reports by telephone once a day to understand the daily progress of each factory and solve problems in a timely manner; the Petroleum Industry Administration issues circulars for factories that fail to complete their tasks, all of which are good methods that should be promoted.

    为消灭事故、提高质量、进行均衡的有节奏的生产而奋斗
    东北行政委员会财政经济委员会
    一九五二年东北地区国营工业胜利地完成了生产任务和增产节约计划，但有些厂矿的领导干部对全面完成国家规定的各项指标，均衡地、安全地进行生产，还缺乏足够的认识，因此生产中尚存在不少缺点，亟须结合讨论一九五三年国家计划，发动职工认真加以克服。
    目前工业生产中带普遍性的严重问题有三个：第一个问题是生产不安全。如电业系统一九五二年事故次数比一九五一年增加百分之十三点五，且多系重大的责任事故，其中仅重要设备损坏和重大停电事故即有十八次之多。高压用户方面，双鸭山煤矿在二十四天中由于运转制度不健全，起动设备不完善，造成掉闸事故一百二十一次。煤矿方面工人伤亡率比一九五一年增加百分之二十。有色金属工业的机械和人身事故较一九五一年也有增加。化学工业中职工中毒和患职业病的很多。造成事故增多的原因可归纳为下列几方面：（一）领导上未把安全生产的思想贯彻到群众中去，因此常因违反操作规程和劳动纪律而发生事故。如电业系统中哈尔滨的巡线工人因路途难走，不沿线路巡线，绕道走大路，致以后发生了断线事故。第三造纸厂工人为赶任务，私自提高抄纸速度，结果抄纸机折轴断带，前后两次停止生产约四十小时。（二）对设备的检查和保养工作作的不好。（三）生产不均衡，前松后紧，突击生产。有色金属管理局从一九五零年到一九五二年三年中，每月事故的比重平均上旬占百分之二十四，中旬占百分之三十六，下旬占百分之四十。一九五二年煤矿伤亡事故发生在下旬的次数比上、中两旬还多。由此可见，事故增多与突击生产有直接联系。
    第二个问题是质量不好，废品太多。有些工业部门违反国家规定的质量标准，给消费者制造不合规定标准和技术条件的次货。如橡胶局出品的红旗牌汽车外胎的质量一九五一年尚较好，一九五二年便逐渐下降，据公路局反映，这批产品不耐磨，标准品能走两万公里，这批产品多者走九千公里，少者仅走五千公里，?面胶便磨光，露出帘子布层来，而且?面胶与胎身容易分离，走不到几百公里便“脱裤子”了。胎身耐压强度不够，容易爆破。橡胶局各厂生产的胶鞋不但样式古老，且容易开胶，中底发脆，已引起群众极大不满。机械制造的质量，现在虽有改进，但某些部件的废品率仍然很高。机械二厂四百瓩空气锤的大拉杆及铜瓦废品率均在百分之六十以上。产品质量的低劣，除了在经济上直接地间接地给国家造成巨大损失外，还使国营产品的信誉蒙受不良影响。产品质量低劣的原因首先是生产单位自领导到职工普遍有重量不重质的思想，缺乏全面完成国家计划的观念。橡胶八厂一九五二年第三季度生产的棉胶鞋，开始时便达不到质量指标，但领导上熟视无睹，不设法改进，整整生产了一个季度的次品。其次是技术管理松懈，技术检查制度不严，因而对半成品或成品的质量掌握不住。有的单位领导上没有给予技术检查科有力的支持，而使技术检查科在督促车间完成质量计划上没有起到应有的作用，检查出不合格的成品竟按合格品出厂了。以前胶鞋厂隔数天才抽查一次，查出不合格品也无法追究责任和原因。第三、利用对某些产品执行优等优价的价格政策做得不好。以采煤工业为例，除特殊用煤外，并没有按照质量不同分等作价，使生产单位有“好坏煤一样卖钱”的想法。第四、有些产品质量不好是由于原材料的质量不好，如钢材不好影响机械的质量，电炉钢不好影响滚珠的质量，炭黑和棉纱的质量差而影响汽车外胎的质量。
    第三个问题是生产不均衡。东北各工业部门在生产上多半有月初松、月末紧，年初松、年末紧的现象。如电工局各厂制造的电动机，以各月下旬生产的台数为一百，则八月上旬为十二点七，十月上旬为十七点二。造纸方面去年各种纸张及纸浆连续三个季度未完成任务，至第四季度就不得不用四分之一的时间去完成全年三分之一的未完成的任务。食品工业部门，小麦、大豆的加工，历年是一、四两季突击，二、三两季闲歇，工厂每年都要停工三至五个月。仅大豆加工一项，出油率损失就达一千三百八十亿元，停工时工资支付的损失达一百五十亿元。由于生产不均衡，发生了一系列的困难，给国家造成很大的损失。譬如月初工人停工，设备闲起来，就增加非生产费用，拖到月底还得加班加点，既损害工人健康，增加机械事故，又容易养成职工违反操作规程、忽视产品质量等习惯，而且使运输事业、电力供应、材料供应、仓库保管、资金周转等都造成周期性的波动。
    现在国家第一个五年计划已经开始，一九五三年的生产任务比一九五二年要繁重得多，如果不能正视上述缺点，并采取有效办法纠正，势将给今年的生产带来极大的危害。因此，必须在职工中进行全面完成国家任务的教育，加强安全生产和重视质量的思想教育。并做好下列工作：
    为了消灭事故保证安全生产，必须：一、健全安全设备，煤矿中使用水风扇，增设岩粉棚子、机电耐爆设备，以防瓦斯炭尘爆发；钢铁工业使用苏联式高温作业皮鞋；高空作业系用安全带；化学工人着用防毒服装和防毒面具；纺织工业增设室内通风装置，以降低室内温度等。二、严格执行保安制度，新、老工人调换工作时要经过保安规程教育，经考试合格后，方得分配工作。三、加强设备的检查和检修工作，严密检查机械设备，凡检查不周和检修不合格的，都要追究责任，及时处理。并推广快速检修，提高检修质量和速度。
    为了提高产品质量，一、应责成厂长亲自掌握质量情况，质量如达不到国家指标，局方应指令暂时停止生产，督促厂方努力改进质量，凡达不到国家指标的产品不能作合格品出售。二、局内应成立专门机构通过召开用户座谈会、实地调查等方式研究人民需要以改进质量，增加品种，改进式样，并按照符合市场要求的规格比例进行生产。三、加强技术管理，严密检查制度，做到层层检查，局成立技术检查科，领导各厂技术检查工作。四、建立质量电报制度，以及时掌握各厂产品质量。五、组织技术人员、生产管理人员、老技工到关内参观，如橡胶工业组织参观团去华北橡胶厂学习，回来后已将学得的技术和经验加以总结和推广。橡胶工业已开始注意质量问题，我们建议不妨再举办一次胶装废品、次货展览会巡回展览，并发动职工讨论，实行用户监督，迅速克服这些违反国家利益的现象。
    根据已有经验，凡是在均衡生产方面取得初步成效的，多半进行了以下各项工作：一、合理地调整劳动组织，一个是科学的定机、定员、定活的劳动分工专业化，另一个是联合小组，两者相辅相成。对于个人应强调专业分工，分工愈细愈专，效率愈高；对于小组、工段、车间，结合分工原则应强调按产品专业联合生产，这样可以使管理、联系方便，调度灵活。因此要继续推广这方面经验。二、加强工作计划性与组织性，细致计算生产过程，正确而及时地把任务按日、按旬、按月下达车间、小组以至个人，按品种、规格、质量等按日完成进度。各科工作如设备的计划检修和检修前的准备工作、材料工具的及时供应，保持一定储备量，工会组织爱国主义竞赛等，都须与此密切配合。三、加强生产准备工作，加强检查工作，有色金属管理局每天一次电话汇报，了解各厂每天的进度，发现问题及时解决；石油工业管理局对于完不成任务的工厂即发出通报，都是应当推行的好办法。
