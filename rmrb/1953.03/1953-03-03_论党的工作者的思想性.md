    On the Ideological Nature of Party Workers
    By Muge Laji, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia, Soviet Union

    The Communist Party is the ruling party, and its cadres are the decisive force in the leadership of the Party and the state. In order to successfully lead the cause of communist construction, Party cadres should always be at the level of modern requirements and demonstrate a high degree of ideological consciousness in their work. At present, as our country is realizing the grand program of communist construction formulated by Comrade Stalin in his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," the requirements for cadres and Party workers in terms of ideological and theoretical cultivation are increasing daily.

    Comrade Stalin taught us: "The strength of Marxism-Leninism lies in its ability to enable the Party to determine its direction in practical situations, understand the internal connections of surrounding events, foresee the course of events, and not only distinguish how current events develop and where they are heading, but also how events will develop and where they are heading in the future."

    Raising the ideological level and the degree of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of staff is the primary responsibility of Party organizations.

    The high degree of ideological consciousness of Party workers should be manifested everywhere, first and foremost in their work and in socio-political life. To examine the ideological nature of a staff member, one must look at how he implements the policies of the Party and the Soviet state, because the foundation of this policy is Marxist-Leninist thought and the objective laws of social development. Ideological workers must subordinate their work to the political tasks of the Party and the Soviet state. He must possess keen political acumen, vigilance, integrity, and an uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings in his work. Only a high degree of ideological consciousness can enable our cadres to rise to truly and loyally serve the people as the Party requires.

    Marxist-Leninist thought is the most powerful weapon of the Party in the struggle for the victory of communism. Experience shows that whoever skillfully combines practical work with improving his ideological and theoretical level, and who constantly politically trains himself, then he will achieve the greatest success in the economic and cultural construction post he is responsible for. The vast majority of our Party workers adhere to grasping theory, constantly aspire to acquire knowledge, and enrich themselves with the Party's historical experience.

    However, we also have such staff members who do not improve their ideological and theoretical level and push aside theory. They usually use the excuse of heavy current work tasks. However, any Party worker who does not improve his theory and ideology cannot successfully lead the current work. The weak ideological armament and weak political training of staff is one of the basic reasons for their mistakes and failures in their work. The minds and work of such staff are very chaotic.

    In the Guljaanski district, the crude violation of the regulations of agricultural cooperatives, theft and waste of collective farm property, and distortion of the Party's policies on the issue of labor organization in collective farms were exposed. These were not accidental phenomena. The District Committee Secretary, Comrade Peikolivili, was very negligent and irresponsible in treating the requirements of the Party Constitution regarding mastering Marxist-Leninist theory and constantly improving the ideological and theoretical level of Party workers. Ideological work in the district was forgotten. It is not surprising that Comrade Peikolivili could not give a correct political evaluation of what was happening in the district and made many mistakes in his practical work. As a result, he went bankrupt as a political leader.

    It should be admitted that in the recent past, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia did not pay enough attention to the significance of ideological work, and showed indifference to such an important cause as improving the ideological level of leading cadres and all Party members. The gross errors committed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia in its work were caused by the neglect of ideological work and the unsatisfactory theoretical study of Party activists, and became more serious.

    Resolutely implementing the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the instructions of Comrade Stalin, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia focused its work on ideological work, striving to make all Party organizations resolutely improve the cause of Party education.

    This academic year, the Republic's Party activists have been absorbed into theoretical studies. More than 300 people are studying in the Republic Party School and the nine-month training courses attached to the school, about 150 people are students of the correspondence department of the Higher Party School attached to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and more than 2,000 people are studying in the Marxist-Leninist night universities. Night Party schools have been organized under the city committees and district committees, and 2,381 Party members are studying. In the Party activists' study classes, about 5,000 leading workers are studying.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia is implementing the resolutions of the 19th Party Congress, implementing many programs to improve all ideological education work, and strengthening the struggle against phenomena that run counter to Marxist-Leninist thought. Regular training classes have been established for the Republic's leading cadres, lecturing on theory and Party history, dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and political economics. In these training classes, Stalin's classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is also studied in depth.

    Various aspects of work are being carried out to help Party activists deeply study Stalin's outstanding work. Ten-day training classes for district committee secretaries and city committee secretaries, three-day training classes for propaganda ministers, and five-day training classes for lecturers of state committees and city committees are being held to study Stalin's works and the documents of the 19th Party Congress. Lecture propaganda in the Republic has also been strengthened.

    Because many new people, mainly experts -- engineers, agronomists, economists, legal scholars, and scientific workers -- have recently been promoted to take on Party work, all these measures are of particular importance. In the past year alone, 427 new staff members have been selected and promoted to be secretaries of Party state committees, city committees, and district committees, or leaders of various departments.

    Some comrades incorrectly believe that since a person has received higher education, he no longer needs ideological and political education. They forget that not everyone with higher education is an ideologically cultivated and politically trained staff member.

    A person with a high degree of ideological consciousness not only understands theory, but also can successfully apply it in practical work. The consciousness of fighting for the noble ideals of communism inspires his daily practical work. Difficulties cannot scare politically cultivated staff, and difficulties will not discourage him; on the contrary, they will arouse his attempt to overcome difficulties. Mastering Marxist-Leninist theory can broaden his horizons and make the leadership of Party workers concrete and practical. A person with ideological consciousness is an enemy of conservatism and adherence to conventions, and he is always a mountain of support for new, progressive, and advanced things. His characteristic is the constant attempt to gloriously complete the trust given to him. Conversely, a person who lacks ideological consciousness abuses the trust placed in him, despises his responsibilities, and violates his duties.

    The most important manifestation of a staff member's ideological consciousness is unconditional compliance with the Party's and the state's discipline, and it is the activity and persistence in the struggle to implement the resolutions of the Party and the government. A staff member who takes the Party's policies and the interests of the state and the people as his guide throws himself into his work, dedicating all his knowledge, abilities, and experience to his work. His creative fighting spirit is endless. The characteristic of his work style is the revolutionary courage, pragmatism, and persistence to overcome various obstacles.

    At the same time, people who do not improve their ideological level often become bureaucrats, become backward and indifferent officials, and treat the resolutions of the Party and the government in a formalistic way. Comrade Shubraji, Secretary of the Samteledsky District Party Committee, lacked ideological and political cultivation, was arrogant and complacent, and lost his sense of responsibility. When he received instructions from higher Party organs, he did not raise the district Party organization to unconditionally implement these instructions, but put them aside. This bureaucratic leader failed to implement instructions, causing the district to fall seriously behind. The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia severely punished Comrade Shubraji.

    The inevitable result of a lack of ideological consciousness is indifference, complacency, ideological laziness, and fear of new and progressive things. A staff member loses his vision in his work, does not pay attention to new things, gradually increasing demands and tasks, and is indifferent to theory; he will gradually become a political philistine and put personal interests above public interests.

    Siharuliji, Secretary of the Maha La Jiefsky District Committee, is a typical example. At first, his work was not bad. He was complacent with these and stopped learning. A non-critical attitude toward achievements led to arrogance. He styled himself as an "irreplaceable" staff member and began to develop non-Party habits of treating activists: flattering and fawning, praising himself, and sycophancy. Party work in the district began to weaken. The selection and assignment of cadres in the district were often not based on professional ability and political qualities, but on kinship and local relations. As a result, Siharuliji was surrounded by sycophantic and criminal elements, and he himself began to take bribes for personal enrichment. The Party expelled this degenerate element from its ranks.

    A staff member's ideological consciousness is clearly manifested in his attitude towards criticism and self-criticism. A true Party leader strives to establish a situation in the Party organization where the door to self-criticism and criticism from below is always open. He is not afraid of criticism directed at himself, because he is convinced that it is helpful to the work and can timely expose and prevent errors and morbid phenomena.

    In many Party organizations in Georgia, self-criticism and criticism from below are at a low level. Communist Party members who dare to criticize some leading workers are persecuted and dismissed from their jobs under various pretexts. Party democracy is undermined. The meetings of the plenary sessions of the Party committees grossly violate the prescribed dates. Party activists' meetings are accidental and mostly "celebratory" in nature. This erroneous situation deprives the Party masses of the possibility of criticizing shortcomings and openly talking about shortcomings.

    Ideological consciousness is cultivated not only in study but also in the entire work process. In the process of discussing the Party's policies and practical issues in actual work at Party meetings, activist meetings, and plenary sessions of Party committees, our cadres deeply accept the Party's policies and learn to look at their own work not narrowly, but broadly, seeing it as part of the Party's entire work. Bureaucracy, vulgarity, perfunctoriness, and political indifference are most commonly manifested in places where ideological life is poor.

    Guided by the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin, the Communist Party of Georgia has reorganized its work, improved Party life, and ensured that self-criticism and criticism from below are widely carried out in all Party organizations. As a result, the ideological life of many Party organizations has improved and become more lively. The enthusiasm and initiative of Party members have also been enhanced, and the connection between Party organizations and the broad masses of workers has been further consolidated.

    The 19th Party Congress put forward a task for Party organizations -- to systematically improve and enhance the ideological and political cultivation of our cadres. All our cadres without exception must improve their ideological level and learn the Party's rich political experience in order to not lag behind life and undertake the Party's tasks. Only by constantly striving and creatively mastering Marxism-Leninism, and by training ourselves to become activists with the qualities of the Lenin-Stalin type, can such leaders undertake the Party's tasks.

    The guarantee for the successful realization of Lenin and Stalin's great plan in the struggle for the victory of communism lies in the high degree of ideological consciousness of our cadres. (Translated by Jun Qiang from the Soviet "Pravda" on January 30)

    论党的工作者的思想性
    苏联格鲁吉亚共产党中央委员会书记　穆格拉捷
    共产党是执政的党，它的干部是党和国家领导的决定性力量。为了成功地领导共产主义建设事业，党的干部应该时时处于现代要求的水平，在工作中表现高度的思想性。目前，当我国正在实现着为斯大林同志在其天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中所制订的共产主义建设的宏伟纲领时，对于干部、对于党的工作者在思想理论修养方面的要求，在逐日提高着。
    斯大林同志教导说：“马克思—列宁主义的力量，就在于它能使党在实际情况中确定方向，了解周围事变的内在联系，预见事变的进程，不仅能辨别现在事变如何发展和向那里发展，而且还能辨别出事变在将来会如何发展和向那里发展。”
    提高工作人员的思想水平和马克思列宁主义的觉悟程度，是党组织的首要职责。
    党的工作人员的高度思想性，应该表现在各处，首先要表现在工作中、表现在社会政治生活中。检查一个工作人员的思想性，要看他怎样实行党和苏维埃国家的政策，因为这个政策的基础是马克思列宁主义的思想，是客观的社会发展法则。思想工作者要使自己的工作服从党和苏维埃国家的政治任务。他要具有尖锐的政治嗅觉、警惕性、原则性和对工作中的缺点的不妥协性。只有高度的思想性才能使我们的干部提高到真正的、像党所要求的那样忠诚地服务于人民。
    马克思列宁主义的思想是党在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中最有力的武器。经验指出，谁巧妙地把实际工作和提高自己的思想理论水平结合起来，谁时时在政治上锻炼自己，那么他便能在他所担负的经济和文化建设岗位上，达到最大的成就。我们党的工作者的绝大多数都是坚持掌握理论，经常企望获得知识，并以党的历史经验来丰富自己的。
    然而，我们还有这样的工作人员，他们不提高自己的思想理论水平，推开理论。他们通常以当前工作任务过重为借口。但是，任何一个党的工作者如果他不提高理论和思想，他就不能成功地领导当前的工作。工作人员的思想武装薄弱、政治锻炼薄弱，是他们在工作中犯错误和失败的基本原因之一。这种工作人员的头脑中和工作中是很混乱的。
    在古尔札安斯基区，曾揭露出粗暴地破坏农业组合规章、盗窃和浪费集体农庄财产，在集体农庄劳动组织的问题上歪曲党的政策。这些都不是偶然的现象。区委会书记陪科里维利同志是非常疏忽大意的，不负责任地对待党章上关于掌握马克思列宁主义理论、关于必须不断提高党的工作者的思想理论水平的要求。区内的思想工作被忘掉了。陪科里维利同志对区内发生的事情不能给以正确的政治评价，在实际工作中犯了不少错误，是毫不足奇的。结果，他做为政治上的领导者是破产了。
    应该承认，在不久的过去，格鲁吉亚共产党的中央委员会对思想工作的意义是重视不足的，对于如提高领导干部和全体共产党员的思想水平这种重要的事业，表现了漠不关心。格鲁吉亚共产党中央委员会在工作中所犯的粗暴错误，是由于思想工作的荒废和党的积极分子的理论学习的不能令人满意而产生出来和变得严重的。
    坚决执行苏联共产党中央委员会的指令、斯大林同志的指示，格鲁吉亚共产党中央委员会把工作重心集中于思想工作问题，力使各党组织坚决改善党教育的事业。
    本学年，共和国党的积极分子都被吸收参加了理论学习。在共和国党校和该党校所附设的九个月为期的训练班中，有三百多人在学习，约有一百五十人是苏联共产党中央委员会附设高级党校函授科的学生，有两千多人在马克思列宁主义夜大学中学习。在各市委会和区委会下都组织了夜党校，有二千三百八十一个共产党员在学习。在党的积极分子讲习班中，约有五千个领导工作者学习。
    格鲁吉亚共产党中央委员会执行着第十九次党代表大会的决议，实行了许多方案以改善全部思想教育工作，加强与马克思列宁主义思想背道而驰的现象进行斗争。为共和国的领导干部建立了经常的讲习班，讲授理论和党史，辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，以及政治经济学。在这些讲习班中并深刻地研究斯大林的经典著作：“苏联社会主义经济问题”。
    在帮助党的积极分子深刻研究斯大林的这一卓越著作方面，正进行着多方面的工作。举办着十天为期的区委书记和市委书记的讲习班，三天为期的宣传鼓动部长和五天为期的州委会和市委会的讲演员的讲习班，研究斯大林的著作和第十九次党代表大会的文件。共和国中的讲演宣传也加强了。
    因为近来提升了许多新人，主要是专家们——工程师、农学家、经济学家、法律学家、科学工作者——来担负党的工作，所以这一切措施就更具有特殊重要的意义。仅在去年一年之中，就选拔和提升了四百二十七名新工作人员做党的州委会、市委会和区委会的书记或各部的领导者。
    一些同志不正确地认为：既然一个人受过高等教育，那么他就不再需要思想政治教育了。他们忘记了，不是每一个具有高等教育的人，都是思想上有修养的和政治上有锻炼的工作人员。
    具有高度思想性的人不仅通晓理论，并且能成功地在实际工作中来应用它。为高尚的共产主义理想而斗争的觉悟，鼓舞着他的日常实际工作。困难吓不倒政治上有修养的工作人员，困难不会使他气馁，相反地会唤起他战胜困难的企图。掌握马克思列宁主义理论能扩大视野，使党的工作人员的领导是具体的、实地的。具有思想性的人是因循守旧和墨守陈规的敌人，他永远是支持新的、进步的和先进的事物的一座大山。他的特征是经常企图光荣地完成给与他的信赖。反之，一个缺乏思想的人是滥用对他的信任，轻视自己的责任，破坏自己的职责。
    一个工作人员思想性的最重要表现，是无条件地遵守党的和国家的纪律，是争取执行党和政府的决议的斗争中的积极性和坚持性。一个以党的政策、国家和人民的利益为指南的工作人员，整个投入工作之中，把自己的全部知识、能力和经验都供献给工作。他的创造的战斗精神是无穷的。他的工作作风的特点是能克服各种阻碍的革命的胆略、求实精神和坚持性。
    同时，不提高自己思想水平的人们，时常要变成事务主义者，变成落后的和冷淡的官员，形式主义地对待党和政府的决议。萨姆特列得斯基区党委会书记舒布拉捷同志在思想政治方面的修养不够，骄傲自满，丧失了责任感。当他得到上级党机关的指示时，不是去提高区党组织来无条件地执行这些指示，而把它们搁置起来。这个官僚主义的领导者不执行指示，使该区严重地落后了。格鲁吉亚共产党中央委员会常委会严格地处分了舒布拉捷同志。
    缺乏思想性的不可避免的结果，是漠不关心、自安自慰、思想懒惰、害怕新的和进步的事物。一个工作人员丧失了工作中的远景，不重视新事物、逐渐增长着的要求和任务，对待理论漠不关心，他就会逐渐变成政治庸人而把私人利益放在公共利益之上。
    马哈拉捷夫斯基区委书记西哈鲁利捷是一个典型的例子。起初他的工作并不坏。他自满于这些而停止了学习。对于成绩的非批判的态度就产生了自高自大。他自命为“无可代替的”工作人员，开始养成对待积极分子的非党的习惯：逢迎献媚、赞美自己、阿谀。区内党的工作开始削弱。区内干部的选拔和分配很多都不是依照业务能力和政治品质，而是依据亲戚和同乡关系。结果，西哈鲁利捷周围都是阿谀的和犯罪的分子，他自己也为了个人致富而开始受贿。党把这个变了质的分子逐出了自己的队伍。
    一个工作人员的思想性，鲜明地表现在他对待批评和自我批评的态度上。真正的党的领导者是尽力在党组织中建立这样的一个情况：能使自我批评和自下而上的批评之门永远敞开着。他不害怕针对自己的批评，因为他确信这对工作有帮助，能及时地揭发和预防错误和病态现象。
    在格鲁吉亚的许多党组织中，自我批评和自下而上的批评处在低的水平。敢于批评一些领导工作者的共产党员，受到迫害，在各种借口之下被撤销工作。党内民主遭到破坏。各党委会全会的会议粗暴地破坏了规定的日期。党的积极分子会议带有偶然性、大部分带有“庆祝”性质。这种错误情况使党的群众丧失了批评缺点和公开谈出缺点的可能。
    思想性不仅在学习中培养着而且要在一切工作过程中来培养。在党的会议、积极分子会议和党委会的全会上讨论党的政策和实际工作的现实问题的过程中，我们的干部深刻地接受党的政策，学习着看自己的工作时不是狭窄本位地、而是广泛地，把它看做是党的整个工作的一部分。事务主义、庸俗、马马虎虎、政治上漠不关心等表现，最常见在思想生活贫乏的地方。
    格鲁吉亚共产党以苏联共产党中央和斯大林同志的指示为指南，重新整顿自己的工作，改善党内生活，保证在各党组织广泛展开自我批评和自下而上的批评。因此，许多党组织的思想生活都提高了，已更有生气。共产党员的积极性和主动性也提高了，党组织和广大劳动者群众的联系也更加巩固了。
    第十九次党代表大会给党组织提出了一项任务——有步骤地提高和改善我们干部的思想政治修养。我们的全体干部毫无例外地要提高自己的思想水平，学习党的丰富的政治经验，才可以不落后于生活和担当起党的任务。只有经常努力，创造性地掌握马克思列宁主义，把自己锻炼成具有列宁斯大林型的活动家的品质，只有这样的领导者才能担当起党的任务。
    成功地实现列宁斯大林在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中的伟大计划的保证，就在于我们干部的高度思想性。（君强译自一月三十日苏联“真理报”）
