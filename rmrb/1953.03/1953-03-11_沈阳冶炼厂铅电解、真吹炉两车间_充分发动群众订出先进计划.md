Shenyang Smelter's key pilot work of mobilizing workers to discuss and formulate plans in the lead electrolysis and reverberatory furnace workshops has concluded. In addition to guaranteeing the completion of the state plan, the lead electrolysis workshop can create 2.2 billion yuan in wealth. The main economic quota of the reverberatory furnace workshop – the actual recovery rate – can exceed the state-specified target by 1.26 percent, and the quality can exceed it by 0.39 percent. After summarizing the experience of these two workshops, the factory is now universally mobilizing workers in the other eleven workshops throughout the factory to discuss and formulate plans.

The process of these two workshops mobilizing workers to discuss the plan is as follows:

When the factory leadership decided to conduct pilot projects in these two workshops, the party branches of the two workshops first organized cadres to study relevant documents and held cadre meetings and expanded branch committee meetings to unify thinking. Zhou Weixuan, director of the lead electrolysis workshop, reported at the meeting on the 1953 production plan: to increase the actual output by 42.8 percent compared to last year without increasing equipment. Several squad leaders shook their heads after hearing the plan, believing that such a high plan could not be completed without increasing equipment. The workshop leaders did not immediately guide everyone to discuss equipment issues, but first let everyone understand the favorable conditions for completing the state plan this year: 1. In last year's production increase and conservation movement, technicians combined with workers to learn from advanced Soviet experiences, and the technical level was significantly improved, creating thirteen advanced operating methods that brought the quality of electrolytic lead up to international standards; 2. The workshop saw the emergence of advanced teams and advanced figures as banners; 3. After the "Three-Anti," "Five-Anti," democratic supplementary lessons, and communist education, the political consciousness of workers has greatly improved, and the organizational strength of the Party and the Youth League has also grown; 4. Production key points are clear, and there is direction in finding shortcuts and tapping potential; 5. Labor conditions have greatly improved, wages have increased, and workers' enthusiasm for labor is high; 6. After two production increase and conservation movements, workers and cadres have experience in tapping potential. After pointing out these favorable conditions, everyone's confidence increased, and conservative ideas began to be overcome.

However, at this time another emotion arose, thinking "No problem, what's the big deal? Mobilizing the masses will surely exceed it." And neglecting the difficulties in actual work. Therefore, everyone discussed the difficulties and problems existing in the workshop's completion of the state plan, which are: 1. With increased product output but no increase in equipment, some equipment is insufficient; 2. The planned target for metal recovery rate was not completed last year, and this year it has increased by 0.04 percent; 3. There is a shortage of labor, there are problems with piece-rate wages, and if the labor productivity of the entire workshop is not increased by 40 percent, it will be difficult to complete the state plan; 4. The management of shortcut methods is not sound. The Party branch studied these difficult problems and found that the key to production was to fully utilize equipment utilization rate while continuing to improve the quality of electrolytic lead. And specifically proposed the direction of tapping potential: 1. The output of anode plates must be increased by more than 30 percent; 2. The utilization rate of cranes and centrifuges must be increased; 3. The output of cathodes must be increased by 66.66 percent; 4. The electrolysis team must solve the problem of concentrated washing liquid.

After the cadres' thinking was unified, a series of organizational and publicity work was specifically arranged. Cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League first divided the work. The division of labor in the lead electrolysis workshop was: the Party branch secretary grasped the overall ideological situation and conducted timely analysis and research; carried out publicity and mobilization work through the trade union's culture and education committee and publicity network; and was responsible for cultivating a typical figure. The trade union directly organized all employees to discuss the plan and focused on helping the key squad of the workshop - the lead melting squad. In addition to managing daily production, the administration focused on leading technicians to study shortcuts and organize shortcut talk groups. The Communist Youth League branch secretary grasped the ideological situation of young workers and league members, and focused on helping the electrode strip team (which was all young workers). A meeting was held once a day to collect and study the situation, solve problems in a timely manner, and decide on the next step of work.

In terms of ideological mobilization, the Party branch first convened a meeting of Party members, League members, and propagandists, reported on the tasks and explained the favorable conditions and existing problems in the workshop. Party members were required to set an example, unite and lead the masses to discuss the national plan, find shortcuts, and also understand the ideological situation of the masses in a timely manner, and report it level by level for summary and education. The Communist Youth League branch also put forward specific requirements to the league members. After the meeting, the trade union also convened a workshop staff meeting, where the workshop director announced the national plan and carried out in-depth mobilization. After the meeting, the trade union organized workers to discuss and study. In order to continuously improve the understanding of all employees, the two workshops also conducted in-depth ideological investigation work. The reverberatory furnace workshop investigated sixty-two employees, and the research results can be divided into three categories. The first category: has a relatively clear understanding of why the national plan should be discussed, recalled the two different lives of the old and new societies, clearly understood the long-term vision of the new society's development, acted actively, was able to grasp the key, find solutions, and had confidence in completing the task. There were thirty-nine people in this category. The second category: had a relatively clear understanding of the national plan, and had great confidence in completing the task, but lacked specific methods and did not use their brains to find shortcuts. There were fifteen such people. The third category: felt that the task was heavy, had no confidence in completing the plan, so their enthusiasm was not high, and their conservative thinking was more pronounced.

The leadership grasped the ideological situation of the vast majority of workers. At this time, the Party branch seized these typical thoughts, organized everyone to discuss them in connection with their own thoughts, and used the masses to conduct self-education to solve ideological problems among the masses; at the same time, it arranged for the Party's publicity network to conduct in-depth education using the "contracting" method, achieving consolidation of the first category, improvement of the second category, and enlightenment and education of the third category, promoting the development of the movement. For example, Yu Hongliang, a worker in the lead electrolysis workshop, initially said: "What large-scale or not large-scale, isn't it just calling us to work more!" Later, after the introduction of typical examples and everyone's ideological comparison, plus the special enlightenment and education by propagandists, his views and attitudes changed. Chen Wanlin, a worker in the reverberatory furnace workshop, did not like to attend meetings and left after work. The trade union visited his family and learned that he had financial difficulties at home, and that if he returned late from the meeting, his wife would quarrel with him, so the workshop's mutual aid fund helped him solve his difficulties. He said with emotion: "If I don't produce well, I'm sorry to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!"

After these meticulous ideological mobilization efforts, the enthusiasm of the masses was completely ignited. People only needed to get together to talk about their great ideals and this year's production tasks. After work, many workers were unwilling to go home, and gathered in groups of three or two to find shortcuts. After the mass shortcut-finding movement began, the factory department organized technicians and staff from various sections and offices to go to the workshops to tap potential together with the workers. The workshop's technicians and technical workers formed a "Shortcut Talk Research Association" and a "Shortcut Registration Office." Corrected the shortcomings of untimely processing of shortcuts last year, and ensured that "every item is accounted for, every item has a landing point, every question is answered, and there is a result if there is a problem." The workers saw that the leaders had made up their minds, and more and more people registered shortcuts. Sometimes the shortcuts proposed by the workers were not specific, and the technicians went to the groups to help research. As soon as a shortcut was proposed, the technicians immediately evaluated it, calculated the effect of the shortcut, and immediately replied or announced the reply.

As soon as the shortcut-finding movement started, the workers in the reverberatory furnace workshop proposed thirty-two shortcuts. However, after evaluation, very few could solve the key to the workshop's production, and it could be seen that the goals were not very focused. The trade union believed that the workers' understanding of the key to production was not clear enough, so it invited the administration to make another report to the workers, clearly pointing out that everyone should focus on finding shortcuts to reduce copper content in slag, extend the life of the reverberatory furnace, and shorten operating time. The Party branch put forward the slogan "Search deeply, dig finely, learn diligently, ask more questions, and strive for a 90% recovery rate and 12 hours of copper smelting." At the same time, a "Key Platform" was also set up, and whoever found a shortcut that could break through the key, his name could be gloriously written on the "Key Platform." Large-character slogans were posted next to the workplaces of each group, pointing out the key issues. The publicity and mobilization work was very lively. The workers all made up their minds to say that they would not formulate a plan until they had broken through the key.

The shortcut-finding movement unfolded vigorously, and in one week, more than one hundred and ten shortcuts appeared in the reverberatory furnace workshop. But none of them were proposed by ordinary workers. The Party branch attached great importance to this issue, because ordinary workers accounted for 30 percent of the entire workshop. If they were not mobilized, the power of the masses could not be fully exerted. The reason why no shortcuts appeared among ordinary workers was that they felt that they did not understand technology, and believed that carrying "big mud" and mixing coke ash were all physical tasks, and there were no shortcuts to be found. In order to break through this weak link, the leadership transferred a part of its strength to ordinary workers, first helping the ordinary worker Li Chunfu find a shortcut, and immediately praised him on the blackboard newspaper, announcing his process of finding shortcuts, thus breaking through the conservative idea that "ordinary workers cannot find shortcuts." Later, the ordinary workers of the entire workshop also found thirty-one shortcuts.

The two workshops found more than three hundred and ninety shortcuts in a dozen days. The technicians found that some shortcuts belonged to the same problem, but each had its own advantages and disadvantages. They thought of Lin Qizhen's experience in synthesizing the wisdom of the masses and creating a rapid copper smelting method with large air flow slag, and synthesized nineteen major shortcuts based on many shortcuts. The lead electrolysis workshop also synthesized twenty-one major shortcuts. The trade union of the reverberatory furnace workshop also took the nineteen major shortcuts to various groups for the masses to evaluate and improve them. The workers put forward some valuable supplementary opinions, making the content of these shortcuts richer.

On the basis of tapping potential, further organize the formulation of group struggle plans. Before formulating the plan, the workshop organized the staff of sections and offices and the workshop's statisticians to form a plan review team, and went to the groups to help calculate detailed accounts. At the same time, the workshop leaders first conducted a pilot project in the Yu Wanjun group to discuss the national plan. After the plan was formulated, the trade union convened a workshop staff meeting to introduce the advanced plan of this group, and called on everyone to learn from them. The characteristics of this group's plan are: 1. The indicators in the plan are comprehensive (including output, quality, cost), output and quality are increasing month by month, and cost is decreasing month by month; 2. The key to production is clear, there are specific technical measures plans, and there are persons in charge of implementing the measures plans; 3. There are clear and specific plans for promoting advanced experiences; 4. Pay attention to safe production, and have security systems and methods for implementing security systems; 5. There are detailed inspection methods and a system for regular inspection of plans.

The workers of the electrical adjustment team originally emphasized that the equipment was not good and the technology was not high, and the conservative thinking had not been completely overcome, so they formulated a struggle plan before the key problems had been completely broken through. This time, when measuring against the plan of the Yu Wanjun group, they found that their own plan had problems, so they revised the original plan into an advanced plan.

With the help of the plan review team, each group made careful calculations based on the potential tapped and the shortcuts found, and successively formulated preliminary struggle plans. However, the acid production room of the lead electrolysis workshop had difficulties in formulating a plan. Although they had found thirty-three shortcuts, they did not have even one that could break through the key. The workshop leaders seized this weak link, and the workshop director led the technicians to go deep into the group, pointed out the direction of potential tapping for the group, and helped find shortcuts, finally solving the key problem, and the weak group also formulated an advanced plan.

Because the groups in the lead electrolysis and reverberatory furnace workshops operate collectively, these two workshops are preparing to formulate individual guarantee plans on the basis of formulating group plans, and then revise the group plans based on the individual guarantee plans, so that the group plans will be more substantial and advanced.

    沈阳冶炼厂铅电解、真吹炉两车间
    充分发动群众订出先进计划
    沈阳冶炼厂在铅电解、真吹炉两车间发动职工讨论和制订计划的重点试验工作已经结束。铅电解车间除了保证完成国家计划以外，还可以创造二十二亿元的财富；真吹炉车间的主要经济定额——实收率，可以超过国家规定的指标百分之一点二六，质量可以超过百分之零点三九。该厂总结了这两个车间的经验以后，现正在全厂其他十一个车间普遍发动职工讨论和制订计划。
    这两个车间发动职工讨论计划的经过如下：
    当厂的领导上决定在这两个车间试点以后，两个车间的党支部便首先组织干部学习有关文件，召开干部会议和支委扩大会议，以统一思想。铅电解车间主任周维宣在会上报告了一九五三年的生产计划：要在不增加设备的条件下，比去年实际产量增加百分之四十二点八。有几个班长听了计划后在一旁摇起头来，他们认为不增加设备就完不成这么高的计划。车间领导同志暂不引导大家讨论设备问题，而先让大家弄清今年完成国家计划的有利条件：一、去年增产节约运动中，技术人员与工人结合，学习了苏联先进经验，技术水平显著提高，创造了十三项先进操作方法，使电铅质量达到了国际标准；二、车间出现了先进小组与先进人物的旗帜；三、经过“三反”、“五反”、民主补课和共产主义教育，职工政治觉悟大大提高，党、团的组织力量也壮大了；四、生产关键明确，找窍门、挖潜力有了方向；五、劳动条件有了很大改善，工资提高，职工劳动热情高涨；六、经过两次增产节约运动，职工和干部对挖潜力有了经验。指出这些有利条件后，大家的信心提高了，保守思想也开始克服。
    但是，这时又产生另一种情绪，认为“没问题，这有啥？一发动群众准超过。”而忽视实际工作中的困难。于是大家又讨论了车间在完成国家计划中存在的困难和问题，这就是：一、产品增加，设备没增加，部分设备不足；二、去年没完成金属实收率的计划指标，今年又增加了百分之○·○四；三、劳动力不足，计件工资有问题，全车间的劳动生产率如不提高百分之四十，就难以完成国家计划；四、窍门的管理工作不健全。党支部研究了这些困难问题，找出了生产中的关键就是：在继续提高电铅质量的基础上，充分发挥设备运用率。并具体提出挖掘潜在力的方向：一、阳极板产量必须提高百分之三十以上；二、吊车和离心机的运用率必须提高；三、阴极必须提高产量百分之六十六点六六；四、电解组必须解决浓缩洗液的问题。
    干部思想统一之后，就具体布置了一系列的组织工作和宣传工作。党、行政、工会、青年团的干部首先分了工。铅电解车间的分工是：党支部书记掌握全面的思想情况，及时进行分析研究；通过工会文教委员会及宣传网，展开宣传鼓动工作；并负责培养一个典型人物。工会直接组织全体职工讨论计划，并着重帮助车间的关键班——熔铅班。行政上除管理日常生产外，着重领导技术人员研究窍门，组织窍门谈话组。青年团支部书记掌握青年工人和团员的思想情况，并着重帮助电条小组（该组都是青年工人）。每天开一次碰头会，汇集和研究情况，及时解决问题，并决定下一步工作。
    在思想动员工作方面，党支部先召开了党员、团员和宣传员大会，报告任务并解释本车间的有利条件和存在的问题。要求党员以身作则，团结和带领群众讨论国家计划，找窍门，还要及时了解群众思想情况，逐级汇报，以便汇总后进行教育。青年团支部也向团员提出了具体要求。会后，工会又召开了车间职工大会，由车间主任公布国家计划，并进行深入的动员。会后，工会又组织职工进行讨论和学习。为了不断地提高全体职工的认识，这两个车间还进行了深入的思想调查工作。真吹炉车间调查了六十二名职工，研究结果，可分为三类。第一类：对为什么要讨论国家计划，认识比较明确，他们回忆了新旧社会两种不同的生活，认清了新社会发展的远景，行动积极，能抓住关键，找出办法，对完成任务有信心。这一类有三十九名。第二类：对国家计划认识得比较明确，完成任务的信心也很大，但缺乏具体办法，没有动脑筋找窍门。这样的有十五名。第三类：觉得任务重，对完成计划没信心，因此热情不高，保守思想较浓厚。
    领导上掌握了绝大部分工人的思想情况。这时，党支部便抓住这些典型思想，组织大家联系自己思想讨论，用群众进行自我教育的方式来解决群众中的思想问题；同时又布置党的宣传网，用“包干”的办法进行深入的教育，做到了巩固第一类、提高第二类、启发教育第三类，推动了运动的发展。如铅电解车间的工人于洪良起初说：“什么大规模不大规模，还不是叫咱们多干活！”后来经过典型介绍和大家的思想对照，再加上宣传员专门负责启发教育，他的看法和态度都改变了。真吹炉车间的工人陈万林不爱参加会，下班就走。工会访问了他的家庭，知道他家里生活困难，开会回去得晚了，老婆就和他口角，便用车间互助金帮助他解决了困难。他感动地说：“我再不好好生产，对不起共产党和毛主席！”
    经过这些细致的思想动员工作，群众的热劲完全掀了起来。人们只要凑到一块，就谈论着自己的伟大理想和今年的生产任务。下班后，不少工人不愿意回家，三个人一堆，两个人一伙地找窍门。群众性的找窍门运动开始后，厂部又组织各科、室的技术人员和职员下车间与工人共同挖掘潜力。车间的技术人员与技术工人则组成“窍门谈话研究会”、
    “窍门登记处”。纠正了去年处理窍门不及时的缺点，保证“条条有交代，件件有下落，有问必答，是问题就有结果”。工人们看领导上下了决心，登记窍门的人越来越多。有时工人提的窍门不具体，技术人员便深入小组，帮助研究。窍门一提上来，技术人员便立刻进行鉴定，算出窍门的效果，立刻回信或公布答复。
    找窍门运动一开始，真吹炉车间的工人就提出三十二个窍门。但是一鉴定，很少能解决车间生产的关键，看出目标很不集中。工会认为工人对生产关键认识得还不够明确，于是又请行政向工人作了一次报告，明确地指出大家应该围绕着减少渣含铜、延长真吹炉寿命、缩短操作时间上找窍门。党支部提出了“深找细挖，勤学多问，为百分之九十实收率，十二小时炼铜而奋斗”的口号。同时又设立了“关键台”，谁找到能突破关键的窍门，他的名字就可以光荣地被写在“关键台”上。在各组的工作场所旁边，都贴上大字标语，指出关键问题。宣传鼓动工作搞得非常热闹。工人们都下了决心表示不突破关键不订计划。
    找窍门运动轰轰烈烈地展开了，一个星期中，真吹炉车间便出现了一百一十多个窍门。但其中普通工人一个窍门也没提出。党支部很重视这个问题，因为全车间普通工人占百分之三十，如果不把他们发动起来，便不能全面发挥群众的力量。普通工人中没出现窍门的原因，是他们觉得自己不懂技术，认为抬“大泥”和合焦灰都是力气活，没啥窍门可找。为了突破这个薄弱环节，领导上把一部分力量抽出来，派到普通工人当中去，首先帮助普通工人李春甫找到了窍门，并立刻在黑板报上表扬，公布了他找窍门的经过，这样便突破了“普通工人不能找窍门”的保守思想。后来，全车间的普通工人也找到了三十一个窍门。
    两个车间在十几天内找到了三百九十多个窍门。技术人员发现有些窍门同属一个问题，但各有长短。他们想起了林其梖综合群众智慧，创造大风流渣快速炼铜法的经验，便根据许多窍门综合成为十九个大窍门。铅电解车间也综合出二十一个大窍门。真吹炉车间工会还把十九个大窍门拿到各个小组，让群众来鉴定它、提高它。工人提出了一些宝贵的补充意见，使这些窍门的内容更加丰富起来。
    在挖掘潜力的基础上，进一步组织制订小组奋斗计划。订计划之前，车间把科、室的职员与车间的统计员组织起来，成立了计划审查组，深入小组帮助算细账。同时车间领导上首先在于文俊小组试点，讨论国家计划。订好之后，工会便召开车间职工大会，介绍这个小组的先进计划，号召大家向他们看齐。这个小组计划的特点是：一、计划中的指标全面（包括产量、质量、成本），产量和质量是逐月提高，成本是逐月降低；二、生产关键明确，有具体的技术措施计划，有实现措施计划的负责人；三、有明确具体的推广先进经验计划；四、注意安全生产，有保安制度和贯彻保安制度的办法；五、有详细的检查办法和定期检查计划的制度。
    电调小组的工人原来强调设备不好、技术不高，保守思想没完全克服，关键问题还没彻底突破，就订了奋斗计划。这次用于文俊小组的计划一衡量，发现自己的计划有毛病，于是又将原计划修订成了先进的计划。
    各小组在计划审查组的帮助下，根据挖出的潜力和找到的窍门，精打细算，都先后订出了初步的奋斗计划。可是铅电解车间的制酸室订计划有困难，他们虽然找出了三十三件窍门，但是连一件能突破关键的窍门也没有。车间领导上抓住了这个薄弱环节，由车间主任带领技术人员深入到这个小组，指出了该组挖潜力的方向，帮助找窍门，终于解决了关键问题，薄弱的小组也订出了先进的计划。
    因铅电解、真吹炉车间的各小组都是集体操作，所以这两个车间准备在订出小组计划的基础上，制订个人保证计划，然后再根据个人保证计划修订小组计划，使小组计划更加充实、先进。
