Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 21st: The "Washington Daily News" despondently admitted in an editorial on March 20th that American money cannot buy any friendship abroad. The paper had to acknowledge that anti-American sentiment is on the rise overseas, especially in Japan, Italy, and West Germany.

In almost every country that feels threatened by American power, the slogan "Yankee Go Home!" can be seen chalked on buildings and walls.

The paper said, "Public dissatisfaction has reached such a degree that even our friends in foreign governments are unwilling to defend us." The paper excerpted comments from some Western European newspapers, generally saying that Europe has grown tired of Americans. The paper admitted that these comments are "very pertinent" because Americans' presence there and the opinions they offer are resented.

The paper also admitted that dissatisfaction with Washington's discriminatory policies in international trade is also rising in Western European countries. The paper mentioned the complaints of British industrialists, who said that if it were not for the discriminatory laws of the United States in international trade, which "interpret the Battle Act too broadly," Britain would have a vast market for selling vehicles, tractors, and other machinery in the Soviet Union and China.

    美国的金钱不能在国外买到友谊
    资本主义世界反美情绪增长
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华盛顿二十一日讯：“华盛顿新闻报”在三月二十日的一篇社论上无精打彩地承认：美国的金钱不能在国外买到任何友谊。该报不得不承认，在海外各地，尤其是在日本、意大利和西德，反美的情绪正在高涨。
    几乎在每一个感到美国势力威胁的国家里，在建筑物和墙上都可以看到用粉笔写的“美国人滚回去！”的标语。
    该报说：“舆论的不满已达到这种程度，连我们外国政府里的朋友也不大愿意替我们辩护。”该报摘录了某些西欧报纸的言论，大意说欧洲已经讨厌美国人了。该报承认：这些言论“非常中肯”，因为美国人留在那里和他们提的意见遭到厌恶。
    该报还承认：西欧国家对华盛顿在国际贸易上的歧视政策不满的情绪也正在高涨。该报提到了英国工业家的牢骚，这些工业家说，如果不是美国在国际贸易上的歧视法令把“巴特尔法解释得过火”，那么英国在苏联和中国便会有一个销售车辆、拖拉机和其他机器的广大市场。
