Eradicating Subjectivist Thought in Chinese Economic Writings
Feng Daling, Associate Professor, Northwest University

Comrade Stalin, the great, has left us, leaving behind an extremely valuable and rich legacy. His complete works are one such legacy. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in "The Greatest Friendship": "All of Comrade Stalin's works are immortal documents of Marxism-Leninism. His 'Foundations of Leninism,' 'History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,' and his last great work, 'Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR,' are encyclopedias of Marxism-Leninism, a synthesis of a century of experience in the world communist movement."

Comrade Stalin's last great work, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," highly summarizes the rich experience of Soviet socialist economic construction and comprehensively studies the laws of socialist economic development. It is the highest stage of development of the ever-fighting and advancing Marxist-Leninist economic science.

Comrade Stalin, with convincing theoretical power, thoroughly criticized several subjectivist erroneous viewpoints, emphasizing that economic laws are reflections of objective processes independent of people's will. This dealt a devastating blow to the various subjectivist erroneous viewpoints that prevailed in the field of economic science in the past, thus making the fighting Marxist-Leninist economic science theory more pure and abundant.

To study Marxist-Leninist theory, we must wage an irreconcilable struggle against all anti-Marxist viewpoints. Soviet economic science has always maintained the fine tradition of resolutely fighting against various erroneous viewpoints. In this great work, Comrade Stalin's criticism of various erroneous viewpoints provides us with a good example. Not long ago, the article carried in the People's Daily where Comrade Suslov thoroughly exposed the mistakes committed by Fedoseev and the article by Comrade Sobolev criticizing several famous Soviet economists are also worthy of our deep attention. Chinese economists should strive to study Stalin's great work and learn from the example of Soviet economic science's continuous struggle and advancement.

It is undeniable that certain subjectivist erroneous viewpoints, especially the notion that economic laws can be "formulated" and "transformed," have also been prevalent in Chinese economic writings. That is to say, some popular economics readers have also introduced these erroneous viewpoints. Now, in order to prevent readers from being poisoned by these viewpoints again, it is necessary for us to expose and criticize them.

The "Planned Economy" magazine, compiled by the Northeast People's Economic Planning Committee, in its translation of economic theory issues, promoted the theory that the annual and five-year plans of socialist countries are socialist social and economic laws. At the same time, it spread the subjectivist view that people and the state can formulate laws themselves. For example, the article "Checking Plans is an Important Principle of Socialist Planning" asserted that "planning is an important law for developing the socialist national economy" (No. 27, page 15); the article "Lenin and Stalin on the Theory of Socialist Planning" believed that "socialist planning is an economic law unique to socialist society" (No. 33, page 1); the article "The Political and Economic Foundation of Planned Economy" also said that "socialist planning is the law of development of the Soviet economy" (No. 40, page 8); the article "Socialist Planning and the Law of Value" contains the erroneous proposition "What is the essence of planning, one of the socialist economic laws?" (Selected International Economic Papers, page 18). These articles, using different words, promoted the theory that socialist planning is the law of development of the Soviet economy. Of course, the annual and five-year plans of socialist countries have their great significance, but they are not themselves objective economic laws of socialist society. Comrade Stalin pointed out: “We must not confuse our annual and five-year plans with the objective economic law of planned and proportional development of the national economy.” If these plans themselves are socialist economic laws, it would mean that the people and the state who draw up the plans are the creators of economic laws. If we continue to reason in this way, we would deny the objective nature of economic laws, negate the existence of economic science itself, and at the same time encourage arbitrariness in economic policy and fuel adventurism.

Many Chinese economic writings not only regard planning itself as an objective economic law, but also as the basic economic law of socialism. The book "Lectures on Basic Problems of Political Economy" by Shen Zhiyuan, published by the Prospect Weekly Press, believes that "planning is the most basic economic law of socialist society" (page 204). The article "On the Law of Value in Socialist Economy" (by Shen Zhiyuan) in the second volume, issue twelve of the "Study" magazine also contains the same erroneous proposition, saying: "What is the substantive meaning of planning as an economic law of socialist society? Why does planning become the basic economic law of socialist society and exert its effect?" This equates national economic planning with the basic economic law of socialism, and confuses the state's policy on the economy with the objective laws of social development. The same example can also be found in "Political Economy Tutorial" by Wang Sihua, published by the Northeast Finance and Economics Publishing House, which has the following passage: "The socialist mode of production makes planning an objective need and a law of socialist economic development" (page 190). This statement, while explaining that planning is based on objective economic foundations, contradicts itself by regarding planning as an economic law within the scope of the foundation. This is not a logical expression error, but a confusion rooted in viewpoints. A more egregious typical example is the 1953 revised edition of "Principles of Economic Planning in Socialist Countries" (by Luo Zhongyan, published by China Book Distribution Company). The author coarsely added some parts of Comrade Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" but irresponsibly retained many distortions of economic laws. He said: "Socialist economic planning itself has the power of law. It is a law based on the application of general socialist economic laws" (page 56), and he cited as his basis Voznesensky's anti-Marxist book "The Soviet War Economy During the Great Patriotic War," because Voznesensky had said: "The socialist design system itself is the law of social development." I don’t know if the author himself has carefully read Comrade Stalin’s new work. Comrade Stalin clearly pointed out that state plans cannot be confused with the objective economic law of planned (proportional) development; and also said that national economic planning, in order to achieve good results, must "correctly reflect the requirements of the law of planned development of the national economy." Isn’t this clear enough? After the publication of Comrade Stalin’s new classic work, such serious errors still occurred. This is an intolerable distortion of Marxism-Leninism.

Comrade Stalin's criticism of the incorrect formula of "transforming" laws plays a huge role in the field of economic science. It completely destroyed the remnants of subjectivist formulas such as "eliminating" and "formulating" laws. Comrade Stalin pointed out: "Some say that certain economic laws that operate under our socialist system, including the law of value, have been 'transformed' on the basis of a planned economy, or even 'fundamentally transformed.' This is also incorrect. Laws cannot be 'transformed,' especially not 'fundamentally transformed.' If laws can be transformed, then laws can be eliminated, and other laws can be used to replace them. The argument of 'transforming' laws is the remnant of the incorrect formula of 'eliminating' and 'formulating' laws." The argument of "transforming" laws is also very popular in our country. Almost all of the few works discussing socialist political economy in our country adopt the incorrect formula of "transforming" laws. The book "Outline of New Economics" by Shen Zhiyuan, published by Sanlian Bookstore, believes that "within the socialist economic form, the law of value exists, but it exists in a transformed form" (page 599). "Political Economy Tutorial" by Wang Sihua also says: "The law of value cannot be abolished in the socialist stage. It operates in the Soviet economy in a transformed form" (page 215). In fact, the law of value, like other economic laws, is an objective economic law that exists and operates independently of people's will. Under the socialist system, it cannot operate in a "transformed" form, but as Comrade Stalin said, its operation is strictly limited to a certain range.

The incorrect formula of "transforming" laws has also been used in our country to study the economic laws of the New Democracy. The book "Political Economy Lectures" by Di Chaobai, published by Sanlian Bookstore, believes that in "the New Democratic system, capitalist production is gradually in a subordinate position, will modify some of its original laws, and at the same time generate some new laws" (page 94). This means that in our New Democratic society, people can also transform economic laws. Two articles on discussing the people's economy in the "New Construction" magazine also promoted the incorrect argument of "transforming" laws. Xu Dixin's "On the Law of Value in the People's Economy" said: "In the New Democratic society... the law of value of commodity production society is being transformed, and at the same time, it is being utilized" (Vol. 3, No. 4, page 22). Tao Dayong's "On Several Categories of the People's Economy" also said: "Within the New Democratic society, the law of value exists, but like in the socialist society, it exists in a transformed form." Although the meaning of the author's so-called "transformation" mainly refers to the fact that under the conditions of the New Democracy, the law of value has been transformed from a spontaneous economic law into a consciously applied economic law. But the argument of "transforming" laws only leads scientific research down the path of subjectivism, and does not provide any specific instructions in the use of the law of value. The correct direction is to scientifically analyze the scope of the law of value in the people's economy according to the route pointed out by Comrade Stalin, and study how to use the law of value to serve our country's economic construction. This has practical significance for the practice of our people's economy.

As mentioned above, the existence of these erroneous viewpoints in Chinese economic writings is undoubtedly very harmful to our scientific research and cadre learning. In the process of my study, I was repeatedly perplexed by these erroneous viewpoints, and when I taught in the university, I also spread these erroneous viewpoints to young people. Therefore, I deeply realize that to learn advanced Soviet economic science, we must learn their spirit of continuous struggle and advancement, and learn their attitude of resolutely fighting against anti-Marxist viewpoints. This spirit and attitude was educated and cultivated by Comrade Stalin. China's new economic science is still very young, and we need to sincerely accept Stalin's teachings and strive to learn from the example of the continuous struggle and advancement of Soviet economic science to ensure the healthy development of China's economic science. At present, the broad masses of cadres and the masses are enthusiastically studying "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and they have high demands for economic science. We should overcome all harmful viewpoints and theories on the road of learning. However, at present, the atmosphere of open discussion and criticism is very thin in the field of economic science in our country, and this situation should be changed. To carry out correct criticism and self-criticism does not mean obliterating the entire achievements of any economist; on the contrary, to carry out sincere criticism of erroneous viewpoints and boldly correct one's own erroneous viewpoints is to show responsibility to the readers and one's own progress. We should always remember Stalin's teaching: "Without controversy between different opinions, without freedom of criticism, no science is possible to develop and progress."

    清除我国经济学著作中主观主义的思想
    西北大学副教授　冯大麟
    伟大的斯大林同志离开了我们，他给我们留下了极其宝贵极其丰富的遗产。他的全部著作就是这种遗产之一。正如毛泽东同志在“最伟大的友谊”一文中所说：“斯大林同志的一切著作都是马克思列宁主义的不朽的文献。他所著的‘列宁主义基础’、‘苏联共产党历史’以及他最后的伟大著作‘苏联社会主义经济问题’，是马克思列宁主义的百科全书，是百年来世界共产主义运动经验的综合。”
    斯大林同志的最后的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，高度概括地总结了苏联社会主义经济建设的丰富经验，全面地研究了社会主义经济的发展法则，它是不断战斗前进的马克思列宁主义经济科学的最高发展阶段。
    斯大林同志以使人信服的理论力量彻底批判了若干主观主义的错误观点，着重地指出经济法则是不以人们意志为转移的客观过程的反映，这样就使得过去在经济科学领域内流行的各种主观主义的错误观点，受到歼灭性的打击，因而使战斗的马克思列宁主义经济科学理论更加纯洁和丰富起来。
    学习马克思列宁主义理论，必须与一切反马克思主义观点作不调和的斗争。苏联经济科学一向保持着坚决与各种错误观点斗争的优良传统。在这本伟大著作中，斯大林同志对各种错误观点所展开的批评，又给我们提供了良好的榜样。不久以前，人民日报所载苏斯洛夫同志彻底揭发费道谢也夫所犯错误的文章和梭勃列夫同志对几个苏联著名经济学家提出批评的文章，也都是值得我们深切注意的。我国经济学家应努力学习斯大林的这本伟大著作，学习苏联经济科学不断战斗前进的榜样。
    不可否认，某些主观主义的错误观点，特别是认为经济法则可以“制定”和“改造”的说法，也曾普遍地存在于我国经济学著作中。这就是说，某些流行的经济学读物中，也介绍了这些错误观点，现在为避免读者再受到这些观点的毒害，我们是有把它揭发出来，并加以批判的必要。
    东北人民经济计划委员会编的“计划经济”杂志在翻译经济理论问题方面，曾宣传了社会主义国家的各个年度计划和五年计划就是社会主义社会经济法则的理论，同时散播了人和国家可以自行制定法则的主观主义观点。例如：“检查计划是社会主义计划化的重要原则”一文断言：“计划是发展社会主义国民经济的重要法则”（第二七期第一五页）；“列宁斯大林关于社会主义计划的理论”一文以为：“社会主义计划是社会主义社会所特有的经济规律”（第三三期第一页）；“计划经济的政治基础与经济基础”一文也说：“社会主义计划是苏维埃经济的发展法则”（第四○期第八页）；“社会主义计划与价值法则”一文，则包含有“什么是社会主义经济法则之一的计划的本质呢”这一错误的命题（国际经济论文选第一八页）。这些文章都用不同的词句，宣传着社会主义计划是苏维埃经济发展法则的理论。固然社会主义国家的各个年度计划和五年计划是有其巨大意义的，但它本身并不是社会主义社会的客观的经济法则。斯大林同志指出：“不能把我们的各个年度计划和五年计划跟国民经济有计划发展、按比例发展的客观经济法则混为一谈”。假如这些计划本身是社会主义经济法则，那就意味着编制计划的人和国家是经济法则的创造者，这样推论下去，就会否认经济法则的客观性质，否定经济科学本身的存在，而同时为经济政策上的冒险主义助长专横作风。
    我国许多经济学著作不但把计划本身当作客观经济法则，而且还当作社会主义的基本经济法则。沈志远著、展望周刊社出版的“政治经济学基本问题讲话”一书，以为“计划化才是社会主义社会之最基本的经济规律”（第二○四页）。“学习”杂志二卷十二期所载“论社会主义经济中的价值律”一文（沈志远著），也包含着同样的错误命题，里面说：“作为社会主义社会之经济规律的计划化，它的实质意义是什么呢？为什么计划化成为社会主义社会的基本经济规律而发挥效力呢？”这是把国民经济计划化当作社会主义的基本经济法则，把国家的政策对经济的作用和社会发展的客观法则混同不分。同样的例子还可在王思华著、东北财经出版社出版的“政治经济学教程”中发现，该书有下面一段话：“社会主义的生产方式使计划工作成为客观的需要，成为社会主义经济发展的规律”（第一九○页）。这一面说明计划工作建立在客观的经济基础之上，一面又自相矛盾地把计划工作视为属于基础范围内的经济法则，这不是逻辑表达的失当，而是根源于观点上的混乱。比较恶劣的典型例子是“社会主义国家经济计划原理”一书的一九五三年增订版（罗仲言著、中国图书发行公司版），作者把斯大林同志“苏联社会主义经济问题”中的若干部分，粗枝大叶地增添进去，而同时又毫不负责地保留着不少对经济法则的曲解。他说：“社会主义经济计划本身就具有法则的力量，它是立足在运用一般社会主义经济法则之上的法则”（第五六页），而他引以为据的，却正是沃兹涅先斯基所著的反马克思主义的“卫国战争期内的苏联战时经济”一书，因为沃兹涅先斯基曾说过：“社会主义设计制本身就是社会底发展法则”。我不知道作者本人是否仔细看过斯大林同志的新著作，斯大林同志明确地指出不能把国家计划与有计划的（按比例的）发展的客观经济法则混为一谈；又说国民经济计划化，要得到良好的结果，必须“正确地反映国民经济有计划发展的法则的要求”，难道这还不够清楚明白吗？在斯大林同志新的经典著作发表之后，还发生这样严重的错误，这是对马克思列宁主义不可容忍的歪曲。
    斯大林同志对于“改造”法则这一不正确公式的批评，在经济科学领域内是起着巨大作用。它彻底摧毁了“消灭”和“制定”法则等主观主义公式的残余。斯大林同志指出：“有人说，在我国社会主义制度下发生作用的若干经济法则，连价值法则在内，是在计划经济的基础上‘改造过的’，或者甚至是‘根本改造过的’法则。这也是不对的。法则不能‘改造’，尤其不能‘根本改造’。如果能改造法则，那也就能消灭法则，而以另外的法则去代替它们了。‘改造’法则的论点，就是‘消灭’和‘制定’法则的这种不正确公式的残余”。关于“改造”法则的论点，在我国也是很流行的。我国讨论社会主义政治经济学仅有的几部著作，几乎都采用“改造”法则这一不正确的公式。沈志远著、三联书店出版的“新经济学大纲”一书，就以为“在社会主义经济形态内，价值法则是存在的，不过是以被改造了的形态而存在着”（第五九九页）。王思华著的“政治经济学教程”中也说：“价值法则在社会主义阶段内是不可能废除的，它是以改造过的形式在苏维埃经济中发生作用”（第二一五页）。实际上，价值法则也像其他的经济法则一样，是不以人们的意志为转移而存在和发生作用的一个客观经济法则，它在社会主义制度下是不能在“改造过的”形式中发生作用的，而是如斯大林同志所说，它的发生作用是被严格地限制在一定范围内的。
    “改造”法则这一不正确的公式，在我国也曾被用来研究新民主主义的经济法则。狄超白著、三联书店出版的“政治经济学讲话”一书，就以为在“新民主主义的制度下，资本主义的生产逐步处于附从的地位，会修改它一些原来的法则，同时亦产生一些新的法则”（第九四页），这是说在我们新民主主义社会里，人们也可改造经济法则。“新建设”杂志关于讨论人民经济的两篇文章，也宣传着“改造”法则这一不正确的论点。许涤新作的“论人民经济的价值法则”一文说：“在新民主主义社会中……商品生产社会的价值法则是被改造着，同时，又是被运用着”（第三卷第四期二二页）。陶大镛作的“论人民经济的几个范畴”也说：“在新民主主义社会内，价值法则是存在的，不过它像在社会主义社会那样，是以被改造了的形态而存在着。”虽然作者所谓“改造”的意义，主要是指在新民主主义条件下，价值法则已由自发的经济法则转化为被自觉运用的经济法则。但“改造”法则这一论点，徒然引导科学研究走向主观主义的道路，而在利用价值法则方面，并未提供任何具体指示。正确的方向是根据斯大林同志所指出的路线，科学地分析价值法则在人民经济中发生作用的范围，研究怎样利用价值法则来为我国经济建设服务，这对于我们人民经济的实践才有现实的意义。
    如上所述，我国经济学著作中存在着这种错误观点，对于我们的科学研究和干部学习，无疑是很有害的。我在学习过程中，就曾一再为这些错误观点所困惑，当我在大学教课时也曾对青年散播了这些错误观点。因此，我深切体会到学习先进的苏联经济科学，必须学习他们不断战斗前进的精神，学习他们对反马克思主义观点进行坚决斗争的态度，这种精神和态度是斯大林同志教养和锻炼出来的。我国新的经济科学还很年轻，我们更需要诚恳接受斯大林的教导，努力学习苏联经济科学不断战斗前进的榜样，来保证我国经济科学的健康发展。目前，广大干部和群众正在热烈地学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”，他们对经济科学的要求是很高的，我们应当克服一切学习道路上的有害观点和理论。不过，目前我国经济科学领域内，公开讨论和批评的空气很稀薄，这种情况是应当改变的。展开正确的批评与自我批评，这绝不意味着抹煞任何一个经济学者的全部成绩；恰恰相反，展开对错误观点的诚恳批判，大胆纠正自己的错误观点，这正是表示对读者的负责和自己的进步。我们应该永远记住斯大林的教导：“如果没有不同意见的争论，没有自由的批评，任何科学都是不可能发展，不可能进步的。”
