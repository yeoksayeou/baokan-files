    Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory Seriously Studies the Problem of Improving Locomotive Quality

    Letter from Mudanjiang Locomotive Repair Factory: Readers Bian Weiliang and Wang Gui criticized our factory's poor locomotive repair quality in the People's Daily on January 25th. After seeing the report, we immediately convened relevant personnel for a serious inspection. The inspection results proved that the readers' criticism was correct. Our factory's leading cadres did not pay enough attention to improving the quality of locomotives, had a bureaucratic work style, and lacked the idea of relying on the masses to improve locomotive quality; these are the main reasons for the poor quality of locomotive repair work. After a decision by the factory-level leading cadres meeting, factory director Yang Fenglin and relevant responsible cadres formed a visiting group to go to the Jilin Railway Administration on February 10th to conduct a self-criticism and visit, humbly listening to and soliciting opinions in order to change our leadership style, improve our work, and improve locomotive quality. After the visiting group returned to the factory, on February 18th, it convened a meeting of all cadres above the rank of foreman to convey the situation of the visit, and each workshop seriously organized discussions and proposed specific technical measures to ensure the improvement of locomotive quality. In the future, we will also humbly listen to opinions from all parties and assign special technical personnel to promptly formulate a technical measures plan to improve locomotive quality, in order to gradually improve locomotive quality.

    牡丹江机车修理工厂认真研究提高机车质量问题
    牡丹江机车修理工厂来信：读者边维良、王贵在一月二十五日人民日报上批评我厂机车修理工作质量太糟。我们见报后即召集有关人员开会进行了认真的检查。检查结果，证明读者的批评是正确的。我厂领导干部对于提高机车质量工作重视不够，有着官僚主义的工作作风，缺乏依靠群众搞好机车质量的思想；这些就是造成机车修理工作质量糟的主要原因。经我厂厂级领导干部会议决定，厂长杨凤林与有关负责干部等组成访问小组，在二月十日到吉林铁路管理局进行检讨、访问，虚心倾听与征询意见，以便转变我们的领导作风，改善我们的工作，提高机车质量。访问小组返厂后，于二月十八日召集了全厂的领工员以上干部会议，传达了访问情况，并由各车间认真组织讨论，提出保证提高机车质量的具体技术措施办法。今后我们还要虚心听取各方面的意见，并指派专责技术人员迅速制订有关提高机车质量的技术措施计划，以逐步提高机车质量。
