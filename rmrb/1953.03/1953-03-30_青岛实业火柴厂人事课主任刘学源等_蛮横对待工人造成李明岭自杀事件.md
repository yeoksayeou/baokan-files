Qingdao Shiye Match Factory Personnel Section Chief Liu Xueyuan and Others
Brutally Treated Workers, Leading to Li Mingling's Suicide

Editor's Note: The Qingdao Shiye Match Factory's Liu Xueyuan and other bad elements' disregard for workers' suffering and their oppressive, domineering style towards workers is a result of the influence of the Kuomintang's reactionary style of treating workers infiltrating the Party, which is intolerable. We must adopt all effective measures to thoroughly eliminate this bad style. Bad elements like Liu Xueyuan must be punished by Party discipline and the law of the land; other relevant personnel should also be given appropriate penalties.

The former head of the Personnel Section of Qingdao Shiye Match Factory, Liu Xueyuan, consistently treated workers with brutality and cruelty, and condoned the bad element Guo Chuan in attacking workers. Geng Kunshan, the deputy director of the factory, and Wang Deze, the deputy secretary of the Party General Branch, similarly ignored the workers' suffering and turned a blind eye to the criminal behavior of Liu Xueyuan and Guo Chuan, resulting in the tragic suicide of worker Li Mingling.

Li Mingling (a Communist Party member) had been actively involved in revolutionary work since 1944 and had a proper style. During his time at the Longhua Match Factory of the Jiaodong Military Region Logistics Department, he reported to higher authorities the criminal behavior of technician Li Haiquan, who raped female workers and forced them to take medicine for abortions. Li Haiquan harbored resentment towards him as a result. After the liberation of Qingdao, both Li Mingling and Li Haiquan went to work at the Xinhua Match Factory. Li Haiquan, as the head of the Engineering Section, deliberately did not give Li Mingling formal work, but instead assigned him to "mobile odd jobs." In 1951, Li Haiquan assigned him and the old worker Yan Shikao to move plates. This work was originally done by three strong workers, so they had to move faster and work harder to complete the task, which was very tiring. As a result, Li Mingling became ill in March 1952.

At this time, Li Mingling requested a change of work from Liu Xueyuan, the head of the Personnel Section of the factory (Xinhua Match Factory). Liu Xueyuan did not even ask if his body could handle the work and coldly rebuked, "Others can do it, why can't you?" Later, when Li Mingling could no longer bear it, he went to the hospital for an examination. The doctor's examination proved that Li Mingling suffered from severe intestinal tuberculosis and needed to be hospitalized for treatment. But when he returned to the factory to ask Liu Xueyuan for leave, Liu Xueyuan impatiently said, "You are always sick, if all the workers in the factory were like you, the factory would not be able to operate!" Li Mingling went to Shandong University Hospital for surgery and treatment, and returned to the factory before he was fully recovered. During Li Mingling's hospitalization, the factory did not send anyone to visit him. After returning to the factory, Liu Xueyuan saw him in the cafeteria and severely reprimanded him, "You are not qualified to eat in the cafeteria!" which caused Li Mingling great mental stress.

After Li Mingling rested at home for some time, because of family financial difficulties, he automatically requested to go to work, but Liu Xueyuan still did not consider his health and continued to ask him to move plates. Li Mingling worked for six days, and his stomach started hurting again, so he had to go home to rest again. During the week that he worked, Liu Xueyuan deliberately did not issue him an attendance book, so that he could not receive his full salary.

In July 1952, the Xinhua Match Factory and eight other match factories in North China merged to form the Shiye Match Factory, and Liu Xueyuan continued to serve as the head of the Personnel Section. In August, Li Mingling could no longer rest due to family financial difficulties, and went to the Personnel Section to request a lighter job. Guo Chuan, the labor protection cadre, held a grudge against Li Mingling because Li Mingling had criticized him at a meeting, and took the opportunity to retaliate, saying, "How can there be so many good things? Are there any easy jobs?" "Your request for work is completely selfish, you must examine your thinking carefully during the rectification."

After Li Mingling's repeated requests, the Personnel Section assigned him to watch the door at the Liaoning Road dormitory. However, he was not allowed to stay at home, and his position was changed to "odd job worker" on the employee roster and wage packet without authorization, which made Li Mingling even more heartbroken.

During Li Mingling's treatment, Deputy Director Geng Kunshan not only did not help him solve any difficulties, but kept emphasizing the "financial system" and making things difficult for Li Mingling. After repeated requests from Li Mingling's wife, Wang Delan (a Party member, also working in the factory), and the help of the factory doctor, the factory lent Li Mingling 1.82 million yuan to pay off the medical and hospitalization expenses. However, under the instructions of Geng Kunshan, the administrative side deducted almost all of Li Mingling's salary every time it was paid from May until the first half of November, sometimes giving him only an empty wage packet. The livelihood of Li Mingling's entire family depended on his wife Wang Delan's monthly salary of more than 300,000 yuan. In late October, Li Mingling asked Geng Kunshan to borrow money to make cotton clothes, but Geng Kunshan said, "You still owe the factory money, how can you borrow more?" Later, Wang Delan wrote a note to borrow, but Geng Kunshan still did not approve it. In late November, Li Mingling went to Geng Kunshan again to ask for a loan or to temporarily not deduct his salary so that he could make cotton clothes. Geng Kunshan replied on the spot, "Can't you put on cotton clothes!" But when it came time to pay his salary, he was still given an empty wage packet. Until his death, Li Mingling was still wearing old flannel clothes and thin pants, and the room he slept in did not even have a door.

Wang Deze, the deputy secretary of the Party General Branch of the factory, never cared about Li Mingling's illness and lack of livelihood, and he completely believed Liu Xueyuan and Guo Chuan's claims that Li Mingling had "positional views" and was "ideologically backward." In order to "educate" Li Mingling, the factory branch passed an erroneous resolution, namely: first, to talk to Li Mingling individually to get through his thoughts; if it didn't work, second, to call Li Mingling to the branch committee for criticism; if it still didn't work, third, to hold a general meeting of Party members for criticism. Wang Deze also vaguely approved this erroneous resolution. Three or four days before Li Mingling's suicide, Guo Chuan had a "personal talk" with Li Mingling. After the "talk," Guo Chuan boasted to others in a threatening manner, "This time I got to 'beat' him up again!" Li Mingling felt that he had no way out and had the idea of suicide. Before his suicide, Li Mingling went to Li Haiquan several times, but Li Haiquan ignored him. So on the morning of December 9 last year, while the workers were in the factory for lunch, he hanged himself.

After Li Mingling's death, Liu Xueyuan and Guo Chuan turned around and said, "Li Mingling's suicide may have been due to political problems," and "Li Mingling's suicide was due to marital discord." Guo Chuan cursed at Li Mingling's corpse, "You are really a 'traitor'!" Li Haiquan also told the workers, "Don't spread rumors, his death is bad luck." Liu Xueyuan even said rampantly, "There are no Communist Party members like him, it doesn't matter if ten or eight die, I don't care about his death."

When the relevant parties such as the Municipal Light Industry Trade Union and the Party Committee of the Shiye Company went to the Shiye Match Factory to investigate this incident in depth, Liu Xueyuan resisted and said, "What are you afraid of? At most, you'll spend a few years in court, what's so great about it?" Wang Deze said, "Death is death, we can't let one person affect the work." But when the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and the relevant departments of the Municipal People's Government investigated this incident, they shirked responsibility from each other. Liu Xueyuan said, "The administrative side has taken good care of Li Mingling and has not done anything to be sorry for him!" Wang Deze said, "Administrative cadres should be responsible, it has nothing to do with those who do Party work."

Liu Xueyuan was not only brutal to Li Mingling, but also to other workers. He often scolded workers who asked for leave as "feigning illness," "making a spectacle," "being mischievous," and "thinking of men." When some workers caught a cold and asked for leave, he satirized the workers as having a "political cold." He also scolded the cutting workshop as having "not a single good thing." When worker Ding Guifang was about to have a miscarriage and asked the Personnel Section for leave, Liu Xueyuan not only refused to grant leave, but also said, "You're resting today, you're resting tomorrow, how many have you rested in the end?" Ding Guifang's stomach hurt so much that she couldn't bear it, so she ran to the toilet and cried. Liu Xueyuan also said, "I can't be found even if I die!" Ding Guifang returned home and had a miscarriage that day. Female worker Zhai Zuolan suffered from stomach ulcers, vomited black blood, and could not eat. Liu Xueyuan said to her: "Just be sick, what can you do? What does it matter if ten or eight of them die?" But Liu Xueyuan's wife could go to work late at will and not be considered late. Once, his wife returned home more than a few days after the vacation, did not extend the vacation, and was not considered absent.

The workers were very afraid of the Personnel Section and Liu Xueyuan. Workers who went to the Personnel Section for something were often "scolded" by Liu Xueyuan until they cried. Sometimes workers called "Director Liu" seven or eight times, but Liu Xueyuan ignored them. Therefore, the workers called the Personnel Section "the second yamen" and "the Yama Temple," Liu Xueyuan was called "the living Yama," and Guo Chuan was called "the little devil."

Liu Xueyuan also abused his power and arbitrarily appointed bad people to attack good cadres. Guo Chuan was originally the leader of the guard squad, and his style was extremely improper. He often insulted female workers. Because he often took Liu Xueyuan out for meals and drinks, he was promoted to a cadre. Liu also condoned Guo Chuan's misdeeds and deception of workers. On the contrary, Yu Zhouying, a model worker in the factory, was attacked by Liu Xueyuan because she asked Liu Xueyuan's wife, Zhou Xiulan, to reorganize the untidy matches during the inspection. Liu Xueyuan said arrogantly at a cadre meeting: "Ask her (Yu Zhouying) if she wants to do it, if she doesn't want to do it, send her away!" and "dismissed" Yu Zhouying's position as an inspector at the meeting, and asked Yu Zhouying to pack matches in the workshop. Yan Deshan, a cadre of the grassroots trade union and an old worker, often reflected the situation in the factory to the Light Industry Trade Union. Liu Xueyuan was very dissatisfied with him and criticized him, "Why do you reflect to the trade union? You are of two minds with the Party!" And he privately revoked Yan Deshan's position as the leader of the production team. He sent him to the countryside to collect matchboxes and often rebuked him for no reason. Su Qingren of the nursery school reflected the situation of the nursery school to the Light Industry Trade Union. Liu Xueyuan said to her, "You are twisting your arms outwards, you are not a good son or daughter of China, you are of two minds with the Party, during the rectification, you have to examine your thinking carefully!" Cadre Li Zhongchun reflected the situation to the Party Committee of the Shiye Company once. When Liu Xueyuan found out, he immediately sent a guard to call Li Zhongchun to the Personnel Section and said to him: "If you go out and don't behave, I'll find a house and lock you up, if one year doesn't work, I'll lock you up for two years!" Liu Xueyuan also privately ordered a cook to be placed under control for more than 20 days, and not allowed to go out.

Liu Xueyuan was so unscrupulous, mainly because he carried a serious "meritorious" burden, and felt that he was a revolutionary disabled soldier and had made "contributions" to the revolution, so he could do whatever he wanted. Secondly, it is inseparable from the connivance and indulgence of Wang Deze, the deputy secretary of the factory's General Branch, and Geng Kunshan, the deputy director of the factory. Wang Deze is a typical bureaucrat who spends his days doing nothing. Even at the factory's general meeting to review the workers after Li Mingling's suicide, he fell asleep snoring in the first row. In his general branch work, he completely abandoned the Party's ideological leadership. He was not unaware of Liu Xueyuan's bad style and the workers' various opinions on Liu Xueyuan, but because Liu Xueyuan used to be his "old colleague," he completely abandoned criticism and supervision. When Liu Xueyuan proposed to dismiss Yu Zhouying at the main cadre meeting, Wang Deze remained silent and acquiesced. Later, when Yu Zhouying went to question Wang Deze, Wang Deze said, "Don't you know it yourself? Did you ever return any work done by Da Zhou (Liu Xueyuan's wife)!" In Wang Deze's eyes, there was completely no Party principles and policies, and whoever offended Liu Xueyuan deserved to be attacked. During the democratic reform movement and the Party rectification movement, many Party members, cadres, and workers raised opinions on Liu Xueyuan's bad style, but Wang Deze turned a deaf ear and did not deal with them; instead, he said that Liu Xueyuan was "serious and responsible for his work." Wang Deze's wife, Sun Qilan, the organization member of the General Branch, also often boasted that "Director Liu is really a good cadre who adheres to correct principles." In this way, the factory's Party leadership organization lost its combat effectiveness. Just as the workers in the factory said: "The General Branch is 'a temple', and the cadres only know how to sit on the sofa and do not do things for the workers."

Deputy Director Geng Kunshan was even more unprincipled in accommodating Liu Xueyuan. Whatever Liu Xueyuan said, that was it. Geng also explained to the staff: "Director Liu has a good position and a good point of view." The workers criticized him as "bullying the weak and fearing the strong." Not long before Li Mingling's suicide, the administration and the Party General Branch were still planning to promote Liu Xueyuan to deputy director. Therefore, it fueled Liu Xueyuan's arrogance.

Now, the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Government and other agencies, after joint inspections and mobilizing the workers of the Shiye Match Factory to inspect the leadership, have completely clarified the suicide incident of Li Mingling and the serious problems in the Party and government work of the factory, and are dealing with them.

    青岛实业火柴厂人事课主任刘学源等
    蛮横对待工人造成李明岭自杀事件
    编者按：青岛实业火柴厂刘学源等坏分子漠视工人疾苦、欺压、统治工人的恶劣作风，是国民党对待工人的反动作风影响到党内的结果，这是不能容忍的。我们必须采取一切有效办法彻底肃清这种坏作风。刘学源等坏分子必须受到党纪和国法的制裁；其他有关人员也应受到适当处分。
    青岛实业火柴厂前人事课主任刘学源，对待工人一贯蛮横残暴，并纵容坏分子郭传打击工人。该厂副厂长耿坤山和党总支副书记王德泽，同样漠视工人疾苦，对刘学源和郭传的罪恶行为听之任之，以致造成工人李明岭自杀的惨痛事件。
    李明岭（共产党员）自一九四四年参加革命工作以来，工作一贯积极，作风也正派。在胶东军区后勤部龙华火柴厂做工期间，曾向上级揭露了技师李海泉奸污女工、并强制女工吃药打胎的罪恶行为，李海泉因此对他怀恨在心。青岛解放后，李明岭和李海泉都到新华火柴厂工作，李海泉任工务课长，就故意不给李明岭正式工作，专门叫他“机动打杂”。一九五一年，李海泉又分配他和老工人阎世考搬盘子。这项工作本来是三个壮年工人干的，他俩只有多搬快跑才能完成任务，工作非常劳累。因此，到一九五二年三月，李明岭就得了病。
    这时，李明岭就向该厂（新华火柴厂）人事课主任刘学源要求调换工作，刘学源根本不问他的身体能不能坚持工作，就冷酷地斥责：“人家能干，你为什么不能干？”后来李明岭实在不能支持了，才去医院检查。经医生检查证明，李明岭患了严重的肠结核病，需要住院治疗。但当他回厂向刘学源请假时，刘学源竟不耐烦地说：“你整天老是病，全厂工人都像你这样，厂子就不用开了！”李明岭到山大医院去动手术治疗，还没等完全复原就回厂了。在李明岭住院的时候，厂里根本没派人去看望过他。回厂以后，刘学源在食堂见到他，还狠狠地训斥：“你没有资格来食堂吃饭！”使李明岭精神上受了很大刺激。
    李明岭在家休养了一些日子之后，因为家庭生活困难，就自动要求上班工作，但刘学源仍不照顾他的身体，照旧叫他搬盘子。李明岭工作了六天，肚子又痛起来，不得已又回家休养。而在他工作的这一星期内，刘学源故意没发给他考勤簿子，使他不能领取全部工资。
    一九五二年七月新华火柴厂和华北等八个火柴厂合并成立实业火柴厂，刘学源仍任人事课主任。八月间，李明岭又因家庭生活困难，不能再休养，到人事课要求分配一件较轻的工作。劳保干部郭传因李明岭在会议上批评过他，怀恨在心，此时便藉机报复，说：“那有那么些好事？还有轻快的工作？”“你要求工作完全出于自私自利，整党的时候你得好好检查检查思想。”
    经过李明岭多次的恳求，人事课才分配他到辽宁路宿舍看门。但不准他回家住宿，并擅自在职工名册上、工资袋上，将他的职务改成“勤杂工”，使李明岭更加痛心。
    李明岭在治病期间，副厂长耿坤山不但没有帮助他解决一点困难，却一个劲地强调“财政制度”，刁难李明岭。经李明岭的爱人王德兰（党员，也在该厂工作）多次请求和厂里医生帮助，厂里才借了一百八十二万元给李明岭，付清了药费和住院费用。但行政方面在耿坤山的指示下，从五月份直到十一月上半月，每次发工资都几乎把李明岭的工资给扣光了，有时只给他一个空工资袋。李明岭全家老小几口人的生活，全靠他爱人王德兰每月三十多万元的工资来维持。十月下旬，李明岭向耿坤山借钱做棉衣，耿坤山说：“你还欠厂里钱，怎么能再借呢？”后来王德兰又写条子去借，耿坤山还是不批准。到十一月下旬，李明岭又去找耿坤山要求借钱或暂时不扣工资，好做棉衣。耿坤山当场答复说：“还能不让你穿上棉衣！”但到发工资的时候，还是发给他一个空工资袋。直到临死，李明岭还只是穿着旧绒衣和单裤，睡觉的屋子连门也没有。
    该厂党总支副书记王德泽，对李明岭有病、生活无着一向不过问，他完全听信刘学源、郭传的说法，认为李明岭有“地位观点”，“思想落后”。厂部支部为了“教育”李明岭，曾通过一项错误的决议，即：第一步和李明岭个别谈话，打通他的思想；不通的话，第二步就把李明岭叫到支委会上进行批评；还不通的话，第三步就开党员大会进行批评。王德泽也糊里糊涂地批准了这个错误决议，李明岭自杀前三、四天，郭传就曾找李明岭“个别谈话”。郭传在“谈话”回来以后，曾气势汹汹地向别人夸耀说：“这一回又叫我好‘克’一顿！”李明岭感到走头无路，就产生了自杀的念头。自杀前，李明岭曾几次去找李海泉，而李海泉却不理他。于是在去年十二月九日上午，乘工人到厂里吃饭的时候，上吊自杀了。
    李明岭死后，刘学源、郭传又翻过来扬言：“李明岭自杀可能由于政治问题压的”，“李明岭自杀是因为夫妻不和”。郭传对着李明岭的尸首大骂：“你真是个‘叛徒’！”李海泉也和工人说：“不要乱广播，他死了是倒霉。”刘学源更猖狂地说：“共产党员没有像他这样的，死个十个八个的不要紧，他死了我满不在乎。”
    当市轻工业工会及实业公司党委会等有关方面到实业火柴厂深入调查这一事件的时候，刘学源还抗拒说：“怕什么？顶多蹲几年法院，还有什么了不起？”王德泽说：“死了就死了，不能为一个人影响工作。”但当中共青岛市委及市人民政府各有关部门对这一事件进行追查时，他们互相推诿责任。刘学源说：“行政方面对李明岭照顾得很周到，没有对不起他的事！”王德泽说：“应当由行政干部负责，这和做党务工作的没关系。”
    刘学源并不是只对李明岭这样蛮横残暴，对其他工人也是一样。他对请假的工人常辱骂是“装病”、“出洋相”、“调皮捣蛋”、“想汉子”。有的工人感冒了去请假，他讽刺工人是“政治感冒”。他并曾谩骂切梗车间“没有一个好玩艺。”工人丁桂芳因要小产，到人事课请假，刘学源不但不准假，还说：“你今天养，明天养，你到底养了多少？”丁桂芳肚子痛得实在不能支持了，就跑到厕所里大哭。刘学源还说：“死了也找不着我！”丁桂芳回到家里，当天就小产了。该厂女工翟作兰得了胃溃疡，吐黑血水，不能吃饭，刘学源说她：“病就病吧，有什么办法？这样的死十个八个的有什么关系？”但是刘学源的老婆却可以随便晚上班，不算迟到。有一次他老婆回家超过假期多天，不续假，也不算旷工。
    工人对人事课、对刘学源都非常害怕。有事到人事课去的工人，时常被刘学源“训”哭。有时候工人连叫七、八声“刘主任”，刘学源洋洋不睬。因此工人把人事课叫做“二衙门”、“阎王殿”，把刘学源叫做“活阎王”，把郭传叫做“小鬼”。
    刘学源还滥用职权，任意任用坏人打击好干部。郭传本是警卫班长，作风极不正派，常污辱女工，因经常请刘学源吃饭喝酒，就被提拔成干部；刘并纵使郭传为非作歹，欺诈工人。相反的，该厂劳动模范于周英因在验货时叫刘学源的老婆周秀兰再整理整理不整齐的火柴，就遭到刘学源的打击。刘学源狂妄地在干部会议上说：“问问她（于周英）愿意不愿意干，不愿意干就打发她走！”并在大会上
    “罢免”了于周英检查员的职务，叫于周英到车间去装火柴。基层工会的干部老工人阎德山经常到轻工业工会反映厂里的情况，刘学源就对他很不满意，批评他“为什么向工会反映？和党两条心！”并且私自撤销了阎德山生产小组长的职务。派他到乡下去收火柴盒，还经常藉故斥责他。托儿所苏庆仁向轻工业工会反映托儿所的情况，刘学源说她“胳膊往外扭，不是中华好儿女，和党两条心，整党的时候，你要好好检查检查思想！”干部李仲春向实业公司党委会反映了一次情况，刘学源知道了，马上派警卫把李仲春叫到人事课，对他说：“你出去再不老实，就找个房子把你关起来，一年不行就关你二年！”刘学源还曾私下命令，把一个炊事员管制了二十多天，不许出门。
    刘学源这样肆无忌惮，主要是由于他背上了严重的“功臣”包袱，觉得自己是革命残废军人，对革命有“贡献”，可以为所欲为。其次，和该厂总支副书记王德泽、副厂长耿坤山的包庇纵容是分不开的。王德泽是一个典型的饱食终日无所用心的官僚主义分子，甚至在李明岭自杀后厂方向工人作检讨的大会上，他坐在第一排就呼噜呼噜睡着了。他作总支工作根本放弃了党的思想领导。对刘学源的恶劣作风以及工人对刘学源种种意见，他并不是不知道，但因刘学源曾经是他的“老同事”，他就根本放弃了批评和监督。当刘学源在主要干部会议上提出撤销于周英职务时，王德泽竟一言不发，默认了。后来于周英去质问王德泽，王德泽说：“你自己还不知道吗？你是不是退过大周（刘学源的老婆）做的活！”在王德泽的眼睛里，完全没有党的原则和政策，谁得罪了刘学源谁就活该受打击。民主改革运动和整党运动中，有不少党员、干部和工人对刘学源的恶劣作风提出了意见，王德泽却充耳不闻，不加处理；反而说刘学源“对工作严肃负责”。王德泽的爱人，总支组织委员孙启兰也经常夸耀“刘主任真是坚持正确原则的好干部”。这样，就使该厂党的领导组织失掉了战斗力。正像该厂工人们所说：“总支是‘一座庙’，干部光知道坐沙发，不给工人办事。”
    副厂长耿坤山对刘学源更是无原则的迁就，刘学源说怎样就怎样。耿还向职工解释：“刘主任立场好，观点好。”工人群众则批评他“软的欺，硬的怕”。在李明岭自杀前不久，行政和党总支还打算提拔刘学源当副厂长。因此助长了刘学源的气焰。
    现在，中共青岛市委和市人民政府等机关经过联合检查，并发动实业火柴厂工人群众检查领导，已将李明岭自杀事件及该厂党、政工作中的严重问题完全弄清，正在处理。
