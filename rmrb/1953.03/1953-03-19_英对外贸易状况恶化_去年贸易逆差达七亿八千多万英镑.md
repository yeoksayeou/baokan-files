Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch: Under the policy of restricting trade between East and West, Britain's foreign trade situation continued to deteriorate in 1952, and the trade prospects for 1953 are even more bleak.

Last year, in order to overcome the serious import surplus crisis in foreign trade, the British government drastically reduced imports and vigorously encouraged exports. However, due to the general shrinkage of international trade in the capitalist world and the increasingly fierce competition in the capitalist world market, the trade deficit for the whole year still reached 788.8 million pounds. This figure is more than 400 million pounds less than in 1951, but this was entirely achieved by reducing imports of many essential goods (including food). As for exports, not only did they not increase, but they also decreased. According to official British statistics, in 1952, the total value of British imports was 3.481 billion pounds, a decrease of 422 million pounds compared with 1951. The total value of exports was 2.55 billion pounds, a decrease of 30 million pounds compared with 1951.

It is also worth noting that the volume of exported goods in 1952 not only decreased in value, but also decreased in absolute quantity, with a reduction of 6 percent of 1951's exports. This is the first such phenomenon in Britain's post-war export trade, reflecting the definite deterioration of Britain's foreign trade position.

Since the beginning of this year, the British foreign trade crisis has shown a tendency to further deepen. The value of exports in January was 218 million pounds, a decrease of 32.2 million pounds compared with January 1952. Particularly noteworthy here is that the so-called "terms of trade"—that is, the ratio of import prices to export prices—resumed their upward trend in January this year. For Britain, which relies on importing raw materials to maintain its export industry, this trend is a further weakening of its foreign trade position.

British industrial and commercial circles have expressed serious concern about the prospects for Britain's foreign trade in 1953. The London "Economist" magazine emphasized that "the struggle to eliminate the deficit" has no hope of easing in 1953. The publication cited two reasons: First, Britain can no longer balance its trade by reducing imports. Second, it is "doubtful" whether the "terms of trade," which had improved somewhat in 1952, can continue to be favorable in 1953. After analyzing these situations, "The Economist" concluded: "The only way to avoid a serious deterioration in trade is to continuously expand exports." But it immediately pointed out: "The current trend is not very encouraging."

Many British industrialists and businessmen cannot help but see that the only real way out for Britain's foreign trade is to abolish discriminatory restrictions and expand trade between East and West. Reuters quoted British businessmen and economists on this issue as saying that the British machine industry (the main export industry) "will tend towards depression" if it does not export more products to the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries. According to Reuters, the British International Trade Promotion Committee submitted a report at the end of February, which called for "serious consideration" of the markets that these countries may provide. The report also criticized the British government for being "too enthusiastic" about the so-called "embargo," pointing out that this is "both unreasonable and harmful to Britain."

### 英对外贸易状况恶化  去年贸易逆差达七亿八千多万英镑

    英对外贸易状况恶化
    去年贸易逆差达七亿八千多万英镑
   【新华社十八日讯】在限制东西方贸易的政策下，英国对外贸易情况一九五二年继续恶化，一九五三年贸易前景更加暗淡。
    去年英国政府为了克服对外贸易上严重的入超危机，曾大量削减入口并大力鼓励出口，但由于资本主义世界国际贸易普遍萎缩，以及资本主义世界市场的竞争日益剧烈，结果全年的贸易逆差仍达七亿八千八百万英镑。这个数目比一九五一年少了四亿英镑多一点，但这完全是靠减少许多必需物品（包括食物）的入口得到的。至于出口，不但没有增加，而且还减少了。根据英国的官方统计，一九五二年，英国入口总值为三十四亿八千一百万英镑，比一九五一年减少了四亿二千二百万英镑。出口总值为二十五亿五千万英镑，比一九五一年减少三千万英镑。
    同时值得注意的是：一九五二年输出货物不仅在价值方面减少了，而且在绝对数量上也减少了，减少的数额达一九五一年出口的百分之六。这在英国战后出口贸易上还是第一次出现的现象，它反映英国国外贸易地位是确定地恶化了。
    今年开年以后，英国对外贸易危机已有进一步加深的趋势。一月份出口货值为二亿一千八百万英镑，比一九五二年一月份减少了三千二百万英镑。这里特别值得注意的是：所谓“贸易条件”——即入口货价格对出口货价格的比例——今年一月份恢复了增高的趋势。对于依靠输入原料来维持出口工业的英国来说，这种趋势就是对外贸易地位的进一步削弱。
    英国工商业界对于一九五三年英国对外贸易的远景已表示严重忧虑。伦敦“经济学家”杂志曾强调指出，“消除差额的斗争”，在一九五三年没有任何放松的希望。这个刊物举出两点理由：第一，英国已不能再用削减入口的办法来平衡它的贸易。第二，在一九五二年内曾经有所改善的“贸易条件”在一九五三年能否继续有利“值得怀疑”。“经济学家”在分析了这些情况之后得出结论说：“避免贸易严重恶化的唯一办法只有不断扩展出口。”但它紧接着指出：“目前的趋势是不很令人鼓舞的。”
    许多英国工商业家已不能不看到，只有取消歧视性限制，扩展东西方之间的贸易才是英国对外贸易的真正出路。路透社引英国商人和经济学家对这个问题的意见说，英国机器工业（主要出口工业）若不向苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家输出更多的产品，“将趋于萧条”；据路透社报道，英国国际贸易促进委员会在二月底提出一个报告，其中要求 “郑重考虑”这些国家可能提供的市场。这个报告还批评英国政府“过于热心”于所谓“禁运”，指出这是“既不合理，又是有害于英国的”。
