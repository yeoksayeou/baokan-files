     Oppose False Reports
    False reports appearing in newspapers are false reporting. Although these false reports arise from certain working cadres, correspondents, and reporters exaggerating work achievements or fabricating them "out of thin air," their ability to appear in newspapers also reflects significant shortcomings within these editorial departments.
    According to inspections of newspapers in various regions over the past year or so, the vast majority of newspapers have basically ensured the authenticity of their reporting. However, some reports in a few newspapers still exhibit serious inaccuracies. Taking reports on false labor models as an example, in addition to the *Henan Daily*, *Fujian Daily*, *New Hunan Daily*, *Chongqing Xinhua Daily*, and *Zhejiang Daily*, which successively reported on false high-yield models Wen Xianglan, Lin Qiumu, Gao Youxian, Xiang Changshun, and Xu Guirong, the *Guangxi Daily*, *Anhui Daily*, *Heilongjiang Daily*, *Northeast Daily*, and *Hebei Daily* also blindly reported on certain false labor models. These false reports can be divided into the following three types: The first type is manufactured single-handedly by working cadres, approved by leading bodies, and blindly disseminated by newspapers. For example, the *Hubei Daily* continuously praised Sun Shaoqing, a false "high-yield cotton model" from Zhu Long Village, Xinzhou County, on February 13, May 16, and July 17 of last year. He even received a 1951 agricultural high-yield model award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. However, this "model" was actually manufactured by Hu Xiangli, a cadre from the province's Department of Agriculture and Forestry. He falsely reported Sun Shaoqing's 1.3 mu of cotton field as 1.1 mu, increased the yield of over 400 jin of seed cotton to 676 jin, and presented Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience as Sun Shaoqing's. Similarly, the *Guangxi Daily* prominently publicized the "labor model" Tang Jiyi from Lejiawan Township's "new record of an average yield of 1,011 jin of rice per mu" on December 16, 1951, and introduced his false "high-yield experience." This false model was also estimated out of thin air by Meng Zizheng, a cadre from the province's Department of Agriculture and Forestry. Meng Zizheng only listened to the boasting of primary school teacher Tang Jiren, then weighed a large basket of rice at Tang Jiyi's house, concluding that it was "1,011 jin of rice per mu" and reported it to the Guilin Prefectural Office, where he was named a "labor model." The second type is where the false model fabricates high-yield achievements, cadres (or reporters) help to falsify them, and the newspaper promotes them as a typical example. For example, the *Anhui Daily* prominently publicized the method of leading agricultural high-yields by Yu Tianming, secretary of the Huanglong District Committee of Huaining County, and wrote an editorial on January 30 of this year. However, according to letters exposing him from Chen Changyou and six others who worked with Yu Tianming (and were recently transferred to provincial-level agencies), Yu Tianming's "empty talk" style has been consistent. Here are just a few of the most typical examples. Comrade Yu Tianming wrote an article about "digging more than 370 wells in the hilly area in ten days" before mobilizing the masses to dig wells, which was published in the *Anhui Daily*. Fearing that the masses would react and the higher authorities would inspect, he ordered farmers to dig some wells along the banks of the small river overnight to conceal his false reporting. In terms of mutual aid and cooperation, there were only five year-round groups in the entire district of ten townships, but reporters Lu Yang and Lu Hua exaggerated it to 301. Yu Tianming's leadership methods were often deceptive, but the *Anhui Daily* praised him greatly as a typical example. The third type is fabricated by reporters and correspondents out of thin air. For example, the reports on the large wheat harvest of the Ma Qingfu and Li Kun agricultural production cooperatives, published in the *Heilongjiang Daily* on August 9 and 22 of last year, were falsified by the newspaper's correspondents Jin Langbai and others, who changed Ma Qingfu's yield of 2,250 jin per hectare to 5,400 jin, and Li Kun's yield of more than 1,700 jin per hectare to 5,500 jin, nearly exceeding the high-yield standard set by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government by more than 27 percent. The *Heilongjiang Daily* not only did not question such a high yield, but blindly boasted about it. The *Northeast Daily* also blindly reported on the "high-yield harvest" of the Ma Qingfu agricultural production cooperative on September 2 and October 7 of last year. Similar false reports also appeared in newspaper pictures. For example, half of the twelve pictures of the "Zhang Xishun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Daming County," taken by Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Ping, supplied by Xinhua News Agency, and published in the *Hebei Daily* on December 29 of last year and the *Inner Mongolia Daily* on January 12 of this year, were fabricated. According to letters from readers Bai Shi, Gao Peide, Feng Xinzheng, and Chai Zhengying, the first picture in the *Hebei Daily* falsely reported Hao Wenqi and his wife, members of the Jia Jianming Agricultural Production Cooperative, as members of the Zhang Xishun Agricultural Production Cooperative, and falsely reported the more than 2,300 jin of grain distributed to Hao Wenqi and his wife for land and labor as more than 4,500 jin. The fifth picture falsely reported the yield of 87 mu of peanut fields as 200,000 jin. This would require a yield of more than 2,200 jin per mu. However, according to the materials currently held by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government, the highest unit area yield of peanuts in the country is only 1,000 jin. The seventh picture also says "the cooperative also has a cultural center," but there is no such thing at all.
    These false reports are very harmful to the Party, the People's Government, and the Party newspapers and national news agencies, and bring many difficulties to future rural work. It causes farmers to distrust other high-yield models. For example, when Comrade Liu Jinliang of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of Henan Province went to the countryside to publicize the deeds of labor model Su Dianxuan, some mutual aid group members said, "Isn't that just the cadre's effort (meaning boasting)!" It also causes some farmers to distrust Party newspapers. For example, some people in Niangniangmiao Village, where Zhang Xishun is located, said, "Hey! That's how the materials in the newspapers are!" The masses have already made strict criticisms of the false reports in newspapers. We must prevent such false reports from continuing to appear in newspapers.
    Why do these false labor models arise? As the editorial of this newspaper on February 27 said: "This is primarily inseparable from the championism and departmentalism of the cadres directly leading production in these areas. They regard the serious political task of cultivating and rewarding labor models as an opportunity to show off their personal work achievements and ask for credit from higher authorities; they believe that the emergence of a famous labor model in their work area is their personal achievement and should be recorded in their personal account. But they have not made real achievements or cultivated real labor models, so they do not hesitate to fabricate false high-yield achievements and false labor models by any means for despicable personal purposes." And why do newspapers publish news about these false labor models? It is also because the responsible comrades of these newspaper editorial departments also have the same problems of "reporting good news but not bad news" and a love of grandeur and eagerness for success. When they see稿件 (gaojian - could mean manuscript/draft/submission) reporting on a certain labor model or high-yield achievement, they are so overjoyed that they lose their heads, thinking that this will bring glory to their newspaper, and therefore no longer calmly analyze and boldly question it. These editorial comrades and comrades responsible for reviewing manuscripts also lack a very basic habit of investigation and research. Although the editorial department cannot conduct detailed investigations and research on every fact reported by the correspondent, it is important to note that the news editorial department should send reporters to the masses to conduct some basic investigations and research and collect materials from all aspects to judge whether it is true or exaggerated. Such an eagerness to show off achievements, a fondness for grandstanding, and a championism attitude should be resolutely corrected. Editorial departments should further educate reporters and correspondents that news must be completely true, and resolutely oppose the bad practice of exaggerating achievements and fabricating achievements. Chairman Mao taught us in "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing": "The Communist Party does not rely on intimidation to eat, but on truth, on seeking truth from facts, and on science." This is the policy of our Party's news undertakings. All professional and non-professional journalists should follow Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly criticize the old traditions and old practices that aim to deceive society and fool society, and establish a style of complete honesty and complete responsibility to the Party and the people. To effectively achieve this goal, newspaper editorial departments should educate editors, reporters, and correspondents through typical incidents of false reporting. In addition, newspaper editorial departments should mobilize the broad masses of cadres and people to supervise newspaper reporting, create public opinion inside and outside the editorial department, and make false reporting have no place to stand.

### 反对假报道

专栏：报纸工作述评

     反对假报道
    假报告出现在报纸上就是假报道。这种假报道，虽是由于某些工作干部、通讯员和记者夸大工作成绩或“无中生有”地捏造工作成绩而来的，但它所以能在报纸上出现，也反映这些编辑部存在着很大的缺点。
    据近一年多来对各地报纸的检查，绝大多数报纸都已在基本上保证报道的真实性，但仍有少数报纸的某些报道表现了严重的失实现象。仅以对假劳动模范的报道为例，除河南日报、福建日报、新湖南报、重庆新华日报、浙江日报先后报道过假丰产模范文香兰、林求姆、高佑贤、向长顺、许桂荣外，广西日报、安徽日报、黑龙江日报、东北日报、河北日报等报也曾对某些假劳动模范作过盲目的报道。在这些假报道中，可分为以下三种类型：第一种是，经过工作干部一手制造、领导机关批准、报纸盲目传播的。例如去年二月十三日、五月十六日、七月十七日的湖北日报曾连续地表扬过该省新洲县朱衖村假“棉花丰产模范”孙少清，他并获得中央人民政府农业部一九五一年度农业丰产模范的奖励。但这个“模范”在实际上却是该省农林厅干部胡相力一手制造出来的。他把孙少清的棉田一亩三分假报为一亩一分，把四百多斤籽棉的产量提高为六百七十六斤，并把曲耀离的植棉经验作为孙少清的经验。又如，广西日报在一九五一年十二月十六日突出地宣传过全县乐家湾乡“劳动模范”唐继懿“每亩平均产稻谷一千零十一斤的新纪录”，并介绍了他的假“丰产经验”。这个假模范同样是由该省农林厅干部蒙子正凭空估计出来的。蒙子正只听了小学教员唐继任的吹嘘，就到唐继懿家用秤称了一大箩筐谷子，便作出“每亩产谷一千零一十一斤”的结论，报告到桂林专署，被评为“劳动模范”。第二种是，假模范自己捏造丰产成绩，干部
    （或记者）帮助作假，报纸当典型宣传的。例如，安徽日报今年一月三十日曾突出地宣传了中共怀宁县黄龙区委书记于天明领导农业丰产的方法，并写了社论。但据曾和于天明一起工作（最近才调至省级机关）过的陈长友等七人来信揭发，于天明的“客里空”作风是一贯的。这里只举几个最典型的例子。于天明同志还没有发动群众挖井，就写了“在丘陵地带十天打了三百七十几口井”的稿子，并在安徽日报上发表了。他怕群众反映和上级检查，就着农民在小河两岸连夜挖了一部分井，以掩饰其虚报的劣迹；在互助合作上，全区十个乡只有五个长年组，该报记者鲁扬、路华却把它夸大为三百零一个。于天明的领导方法很多是欺骗的方法，安徽日报却把他当作典型大加表扬。第三种是，记者、通讯员无中生有，假造出来的。例如，黑龙江日报去年八月九日、二十二日先后发表的马庆福、李坤农业生产合作社大片小麦丰收的报道，就是该报通讯员金浪白等人，把马庆福每垧产量二千二百五十斤假造为五千四百斤，把李坤每垧产量一千七百多斤假造为五千五百斤，几乎超过中央农业部规定的高额产量标准百分之二十七以上。黑龙江日报对于这样的高额产量不但不加以怀疑，反作了盲目的吹嘘。去年九月二日、十月七日的东北日报，也对马庆福农业生产合作社的“高额丰产”作了盲目的报道。类似这种假报道，同样出现在报纸图片上。例如，由新华社记者张平拍摄、新华社供给、在去年十二月二十九日河北日报和今年一月十二日内蒙古日报刊登的“大名县张希顺农业生产合作社”的十二张图片中，就有一半是假造的。据读者白石、高培德、冯新正、柴正英来信揭发，河北日报第一幅图片把贾建明农业生产合作社的社员郝文其夫妇，假报为张希顺农业生产合作社的社员，并把郝文其夫妇土地劳力分红的二千三百多斤粮食，虚报为四千五百多斤。第五幅图片把八十七亩花生地的产量虚报为二十万斤。这样每亩产量就需二千二百多斤。但据中央农业部现在掌握的材料，全国花生最高单位面积产量也不过一千斤。还有第七幅图片中说“社里还设有文化馆”，其实就根本没有这回事。
    这些假报道对于党、人民政府以及党报和国家通讯社的危害是很大的，而且为今后农村工作带来许多困难。它引起农民群众对其他丰产模范不信任，如河南许昌地委刘进良同志下乡向群众宣传劳动模范苏殿选的事迹时，有些互助组组员就说：“那还不是干部的劲（按即吹嘘）！”它也同样引起一些农民群众对党报的不信任，如张希顺所在村娘娘庙就有些群众说：“咳！报纸上的材料就是那样呗！”群众已经对报纸的假报道提出严格的批评。我们必须杜绝这种假报道在报纸上继续出现。
    为什么会产生这些假劳动模范呢？正如二月二十七日本报社论中所说的：“这首先是和这些地区直接领导生产的干部的锦标主义、本位主义思想分不开的。他们把培养和奖励劳动模范这样一个严肃的政治任务，看成是表现个人工作成绩、向上级邀功的机会；他们认为在他们所在的工作地区出现了一个有名的劳动模范，那就是他们个人的功劳，应该记在他们个人的账上。但是他们并没有作出真正的成绩，培养出真正的劳动模范，于是，他们就不惜为了可耻的个人目的，不择手段地捏造假的丰产成绩和假的劳动模范。”而报纸为什么会刊出这些假劳动模范的新闻呢？也是因为这些报纸编辑部的负责同志同样存在着这种“报喜不报忧”和好大喜功的锦标主义的毛病，他们一见报道某某劳动模范或者高额丰产成绩的稿件，就高兴得冲昏了头脑，以为这一下就给自己的报纸增光了，因而也就不再冷静地去分析和大胆怀疑。这些编辑同志和负责审稿的同志，还缺乏一种很起码的调查研究的习惯。虽然编辑部不可能对于通讯员所报道的每一件事实都去进行详尽的调查研究，但是像发现一个全省性甚至全国性的劳动模范或者高额丰产成绩，编辑部对这样重大的新闻，无论如何不能只凭通讯员的报道，也不能只凭业务机关的材料就信以为真，而应该派出记者到群众中去做一些基本情况的调查研究，从各方面搜集材料来判断其是否真实，是否夸大。报纸编辑部不经过起码的调查研究就急着发表这样重大的新闻，这种急于表现成绩的、好大喜功的风头主义和锦标主义的作风，是应该坚决予以纠正的。编辑部对于记者和通讯员更应该进行新闻必须完全真实的教育，坚决反对那种夸大成绩、捏造成绩的恶劣作风。毛主席在“反对党八股”一文中就曾教导我们说：“共产党不靠吓人吃饭，而靠真理吃饭，靠实事求是吃饭，靠科学吃饭。”这是我们党的新闻事业的方针。凡专业的非专业的新闻工作者，都应遵循毛主席的指示，彻底批判那些以欺骗社会、愚弄社会为目的的旧传统旧作风，而树立对党对人民完全诚实、完全负责的作风。为有效地达到这一目的，报纸编辑部应通过假报道的典型事件对编辑、记者、通讯员进行教育。另外，报纸编辑部还应发动广大干部群众来监督报纸的报道，在编辑部内外造成舆论，使假报道无容身之所。
