    Heroes of the Stalin Era
    ——Viewing the Soviet Films "The Vow," "The Battle of Stalingrad," and "The Fall of Berlin"
    Lu Bin
    On this day when Comrade Stalin has forever parted from us, we are greatly educated by watching Soviet films such as "The Vow," "The Battle of Stalingrad," and "The Fall of Berlin." The overwhelming historical force, the surging tide of revolution and construction, and the immortal creative activities of Stalin are vividly presented on the screen, allowing us to deeply understand what the Stalin era was like, what the Stalin cause is, and what the Stalin spirit is.

      "The Vow" depicts Comrade Stalin, from the day he took the oath before Lenin's remains, shouldering all the burdens left by Lenin, leading the people of the whole country with skillful leadership to clear the rubble from the ruins, build a magnificent socialist palace, and create a new epoch in history. "The Battle of Stalingrad" is a true record of the earth-shattering Battle of Stalingrad. "The Fall of Berlin" reflects the entire course of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union. In these glorious historical paintings, we see the brilliance of Stalin's revolutionary genius everywhere. Stalin's outstanding revolutionary wisdom, profound revolutionary knowledge, burning revolutionary enthusiasm, brilliant revolutionary foresight, and extraordinary revolutionary perseverance are all brilliantly expressed here.

    From the Vow to the Fall of Berlin, Comrade Stalin experienced a great and arduous path of victory. He inherited and developed the immortal cause of Lenin, changed the face of world history, and created a new era of socialism. The source of victory for the Stalin cause lies in the inseparable connection between the revolutionary leader and the broad masses of working people, and the unbreakable foundation of this connection is the creation of a free and happy life for the people. The intimate relationship between Stalin and the Petrov family depicted in the film "The Vow" is a generalization of the relationship between Stalin and all the working people of the Soviet Union. Petrov defended Tsaritsyn with Stalin in 1918, repelling the fierce attack of German imperialism. After Petrov was killed by the landlords, his family handed over the letter he wrote to Lenin before his death to Stalin, who was taking an oath before Lenin's remains. This family took the oath with Stalin, built together, fought together, and raised their glasses to celebrate victory together. Naturally, this victory was not easily obtained, as Varvara said while caressing the body of her daughter who was burned to death by the enemy: "With every step forward, we have to pay the price in blood." Despite this, the people of the Stalin era continued to advance, from one victory to another greater victory.

    The people of the Stalin era were invincible because they were raised under the education of the Party of Lenin and Stalin. They deeply understood love and hate, understood the difficulty of creating a free and happy new life, and had the determination to defend and develop it at all costs. This new life belonged not only to themselves but also to all mankind, to generations of descendants. They understood their responsibilities. The solemn image of Varvara in "The Vow" is the embodiment of this thought and feeling. Her husband was killed by the landlords, and her daughter was burned to death by the counter-revolutionaries. She wiped away her tears, straightened her chest, and continued to participate in the construction of Stalingrad. But when countless tractors appeared in the fields, and the steel furnaces of the newly built factories poured out molten steel, she heard the news that the German Nazi bandits were about to attack the Soviet Union. After attending a banquet celebrating the victory of socialist construction in the Kremlin, when she learned from Comrade Stalin that war was inevitable, she said to Comrade Stalin:
      "That's good too, Joseph Vissarionovich, while we can still see it with our own eyes. We are a people tempered in the fire, accustomed to fighting our way out of difficulties. What haven't we seen? We have strong shoulders, and we will fight even if they ride on our necks. ......"

    This not only showed the deep grief of a loving mother in the Soviet state, but also showed the steel-like strength of a Soviet fighter. In the Battle of Stalingrad, she encouraged her son to bravely kill the enemy, she wrote the slogan "Resist to the Death" on the newly manufactured tanks, and she took up the gun in front of the enemy to protect her grandchildren. The men and women heroes of Stalingrad used such "Resist to the Death" to annihilate 330,000 of the German elite, reversing the situation of the entire Patriotic War. When groups of German prisoners of war were escorted out of the factory workshop by the soldiers, Varvara, with tears in her eyes, looked at this indomitable city and said, "Dear, you finally held on!"

    The Soviet Union's Patriotic War was a sacred war that determined the fate of all mankind, and the great victory achieved by the Soviet people in this war was a great contribution to generations of mankind. Comrade Stalin said to Varvara after the end of the Battle of Stalingrad: "Yes, we have fulfilled our vow, and this is entirely because you and other millions of Soviet mothers have raised those outstanding sons. The blood shed by our people has yielded great rewards. Mankind will never forget that it was our people who gave them freedom."

    Yes, the mothers and sons of the Soviet state are forever a shining example to mankind. The steelworker Ivanov in "The Fall of Berlin" is the representative of these sons. He loved the motherland, loved labor, was good at creation, and was brave in battle. His mother's conversation with the female teacher Natasha is a true description of this Soviet youth:
    "......Girl, you can say that we are not ordinary people......We never underestimate ourselves. Of course, Alyosha's technology has surpassed his ancestors, and he has finally won great honor. Once he said to me: 'I say, Mom, I am a person of the Stalin era!' That's right, he is a person of the Stalin era, he is not afraid at all, and difficulties do not exist in front of him. ......" It was these people of the Stalin era who crushed fifty German divisions in the Battle of Moscow, created the miracle of history in the Battle of Stalingrad, and defended the inviolable dignity of mankind, and then chased and attacked, straight to Berlin!

    Since Lenin's death, Comrade Stalin has tempered thousands upon thousands of mothers like Varvara and cultivated thousands upon thousands of sons like Ivanov in the lofty cause of creating and defending human freedom, happiness, and peace. This is a truly immortal achievement. Decades are not a very long time, but under the brilliant inspiration of the Stalin cause, how profound changes have taken place in the world! When Comrade Stalin stood before Lenin's remains to take the oath, the young Soviet Union was still an isolated island in the ocean of capitalism, while today's Soviet Union is the great core and leader of the invincible camp of socialism and people's democracy, including more than 800 million people, and the lighthouse that all colonial and capitalist countries' working people look up to. How fast the historical wheel of the Stalin era has turned! Forward, forward, and forward again, glorious people of the Stalin era! (Attached images)

    斯大林时代的英雄们
    ——看苏联影片“宣誓”、“斯大林格勒大血战”和“攻克柏林”
    陆彬
    在斯大林同志永别了我们的今天，看了“宣誓”、“斯大林格勒大血战”和“攻克柏林”等苏联影片，我们受到伟大的教育。排山倒海的历史动力，奔腾澎湃的革命和建设的热潮，不朽的斯大林的创造性活动，都活现在银幕上，使我们深切地认识斯大林时代是怎样的时代，斯大林事业是怎样的事业，斯大林精神是怎样的精神。
      “宣誓”描写斯大林同志从他在列宁灵前宣誓那
    一天起，挑起列宁遗留下来的全部重担，指挥若定地领导全国人民扫清废墟上的瓦砾，建造起光辉灿烂的社会主义殿堂，开创了历史的新纪元。“斯大林格勒大血战”是惊天动地的斯大林格勒保卫战的真实纪录。“攻克柏林”反映了伟大的苏联卫国战争的全部过程。在这些辉煌的历史画卷中，我们到处看到斯大林的革命天才的闪耀。斯大林的杰出的革命智慧、渊博的革命知识、燃烧的革命热情、英明的革命预见和非凡的革命毅力，都在这里获得了光辉的表现。
    从宣誓到攻克柏林，斯大林同志经历了伟大而又艰辛的胜利途程。他继承了、发展了不朽的列宁的事业，改变了世界历史的面貌，创造了社会主义的新时代。斯大林事业的胜利泉源，在于革命领袖与广大劳动人民的血肉联系，而这种联系的牢不可破的基础，就是人民的自由幸福生活的创造。影片
    “宣誓”所表现的斯大林与彼得洛夫一家人的亲密关系，是斯大林与苏联全体劳动人民的关系的概括。彼得洛夫在一九一八年与斯大林一起保卫过察里津，击退了凶恶的德国帝国主义的进攻。而在彼得洛夫被地主杀害之后，他的家人又把他临死时写给列宁的信交给正在列宁灵前宣誓的斯大林。这一家人和斯大林一起宣誓，一起建设，一起斗争，一起举杯庆祝胜利。自然，这种胜利不是轻易得到的，正如瓦尔瓦拉在抚摩被敌人放火烧死的女儿尸体时所说：“每前进一步，我们都要用血作代价。”尽管这样，斯大林时代的人民还是不断前进，从一个胜利到另一个更大的胜利。
    斯大林时代的人民之所以不可战胜，因为他们是在列宁、斯大林党的教养下成长起来的。他们深刻地懂得爱和恨，懂得创造自由幸福的新生活的艰难，有不惜一切代价来保卫它、发展它的决心。这种新生活不仅属于他们自己，而且属于全人类，属于世世代代的子孙。他们懂得自己的责任。“宣誓”中瓦尔瓦拉的庄严形象，就是这种思想感情的体现者。她的丈夫被地主杀死了，她的女儿被反革命分子放火烧死了。她揩掉眼泪，挺起胸膛，继续参加斯大林格勒的建设工作。但当田野上出现了无数拖拉机，新建工厂的炼钢炉倾泻出钢水的时候，她又听到德国纳粹匪帮要来进攻苏联的消息。她在克里姆林宫参加了庆祝社会主义建设胜利的宴会之后，从斯大林同志口中知道战争不可避免时，这样对斯大林同志说：
      “这样也好，约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇，趁我们还能亲眼看见。我们——是千锤百炼的人民，惯会从困难中杀出路来。什么事情没有见识过？我们有的是结实的肩膀，就是骑在我们的脖子上也还是要打的。……”
    这不但表现了苏维埃国家里的一个慈母的深刻悲痛，也表现了苏维埃战士的钢铁般的坚强。在斯大林格勒大血战中，她鼓励儿子勇敢杀敌，她在刚出厂的战车上写着“誓死抵抗”的口号，她在敌人面前拿起枪杆保卫自己的孙儿。斯大林格勒的男女英雄们就用这样的“誓死抵抗”，歼灭了三十三万德寇精粹，扭转了整个卫国战争的局势。当成群的德军俘虏被战士们押出工厂车间的时候，瓦尔瓦拉带着满眶的眼泪，看着这不屈的城市，说：“亲爱的，你到底守住了！”
    苏联的卫国战争，是决定全人类命运的神圣战争，苏联人民在这一战争中所取得的伟大胜利，是对于人类世代子孙的莫大贡献。斯大林同志在斯大林格勒保卫战结束之后对瓦尔瓦拉说：“是的，我们履行了我们的誓言，这完全是因为你和其他千千万万苏维埃的母亲们抚养了那些杰出的儿子。我们人民所流的血，得到了伟大的收获。人类将永远不会忘记是我们人民使他们获得了自由。”
    是的，苏维埃国家的母亲们和儿子们永远是人类的光辉榜样，“攻克柏林”中的炼钢工人伊凡诺夫，便是这些儿子的代表。他热爱祖国，热爱劳动，善于创造，勇于战斗。他的母亲对女教师娜塔莎的谈话，就是关于这个苏维埃青年的真实描写：
    “……姑娘，可以说我们不是平凡的人……我们从不看轻自己。当然，阿略沙的技术超过了祖先，终于获得莫大的荣誉。有一次他对我说：‘我说，妈妈，我是斯大林时代的人呵！’不错，是斯大林时代的人，他毫不畏惧，在他面前，困难是不存在的。……”就是这些斯大林时代的人们在莫斯科保卫战中击溃了五十个德寇师团，在斯大林格勒保卫战中创造了历史的奇迹，维护了人类不可侵犯的尊严，于是跟踪追击，直捣柏林！
    列宁逝世以来，斯大林同志在创造和保卫人类的自由、幸福与和平的崇高事业中，锻炼了千千万万像瓦尔瓦拉这样的母亲，培养了千千万万像伊凡诺夫这样的儿子，这是真正不朽的功勋。几十年的时间不算很长，但在斯大林事业的光辉的鼓舞下，世界起了多么深刻的变化！当斯大林同志站在列宁灵前宣誓的时候，年青的苏联还是资本主义海洋里的孤岛，而今天的苏联，则是包括八万万以上人口的社会主义和人民民主无敌阵营的伟大核心和领导者，一切殖民地和资本主义国家劳动人民所仰望的灯塔。斯大林时代的历史车轮转动得多么快！前进，前进，再前进吧，光荣的斯大林时代的人们！（附图片）
