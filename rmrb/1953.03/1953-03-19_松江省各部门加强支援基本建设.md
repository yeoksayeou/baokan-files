    Songjiang Province Departments Strengthen Support for Basic Construction

   [This newspaper report] After the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a work conference on basic construction, many non-construction units in Songjiang Province successively criticized the idea that "basic construction has nothing to do with me" and put forward specific methods or plans for improving the work of supporting basic construction.

    In the past, non-construction units in Songjiang Province generally had wrong views on basic construction, thinking that "basic construction is a matter for industrial departments, and its success or failure has nothing to do with me," and "I can't even finish my own work, how can I have time to take care of these things?" Therefore, they did not actively serve basic construction. For example, the trade department did not pay attention to how to ensure the supply of basic construction materials and the daily life needs of employees, so that many construction sites could not get good grain and vegetables. In particular, the Coal Construction Company and the Industrial Equipment Company did not actively contact the basic construction departments, and the quantity of materials allocated to the basic construction departments was insufficient, and some specifications were not suitable, which directly affected the progress of the project. When transferring cadres to basic construction departments, many departments showed departmentalism. For example, when both basic construction departments and hospitals lacked cadres, the health department often supplemented the cadres to the hospitals instead of the construction sites. In the discussions, all units criticized the erroneous ideas, thereby strengthening the concept of serving basic construction and began to actively understand the needs of the basic construction departments, and put forward improvement measures based on their respective situations. For example, the commercial department proposed to urge cooperatives in cities and counties with basic construction projects to establish cooperatives in larger construction sites before construction. The Provincial Department of Industry proposed to actively supply basic construction materials, produce a large number of lime, red stone, plywood, small hardware, etc., to ensure product quality and meet the needs of basic construction. The Provincial People's Supervisory Committee is preparing to develop a group of people's supervision correspondents among construction workers before and after winter training. The Provincial Department of Finance decided to strengthen the inspection of basic construction financial work, do a good job in financial supervision, establish a financial system, accurately calculate costs, and ensure the completion of basic construction tasks. The Propaganda Department of the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Government Health Department have further formulated specific plans to serve basic construction. For example, the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee stipulated in its plan that the propaganda work on basic construction should be led by a minister, and each department should also designate a special person to be responsible; leading cadres should also regularly go deep into companies and construction sites to discover and solve problems in a timely manner; it stipulated that the department affairs meeting and the department affairs meeting should regularly study the propaganda work related to basic construction. The plan of the Provincial Health Department is also very specific. They proposed to help construction sites train health and healthcare personnel; when construction sites need cadres, they will do their best to support them; they will organize small mobile medical teams to go deep into construction sites to help carry out health work; and designate beds in major hospitals to specifically receive basic construction workers.

    However, some departments, such as the Organization Department and the Rural Work Department of the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee, the Provincial People's Government Personnel Department, the Civil Affairs Department, the Agriculture Department, the Forestry Department, the Highway Bureau, the Posts and Telecommunications Bureau, the Power Bureau, the Provincial Bank, and the Court, have not conducted in-depth inspections; or have not yet proposed improvement methods and formulated specific plans; some have not even inspected this work.

### 松江省各部门加强支援基本建设

    松江省各部门加强支援基本建设
   【本报讯】中共中央东北局基本建设工作会议结束后，松江省许多非建筑单位先后批判了“基本建设与我无关”的思想，提出了改进支援基本建设工作的具体办法或计划。
    过去，松江省非建筑单位对基本建设普遍有着错误的看法，认为“基本建设是工业部门的事，工作好坏和我无关”，“自己工作还做不过来，哪有工夫管这些事”，因此就没有积极地为基本建设服务。例如贸易部门就没有注意如何保证供应基本建设材料和职工生活需要，以致有很多工程现场吃不到好粮食和蔬菜。特别是煤建公司和工业器材公司没有主动和基本建设部门联系，调拨给基本建设部门的材料数量既不足，有的规格还不合适，直接影响了工程进度。在向基本建设部门输送干部时，很多部门表现了本位主义。例如当基本建设部门和医院同时缺乏干部时，卫生部门往往把干部补充给医院而不给工地。各单位在讨论当中，对错误思想都进行了批判，从而加强了为基本建设服务的观念，开始主动地去了解基本建设部门的需要，并根据各自的情况，提出了改进措施。如商业部门提出要督促在有基本建设工程的市、县的合作社，在施工前在较大工地建立起合作社。省工业厅提出积极供给基本建设材料，大量生产石灰、红石、胶合板、小五金等，保证产品质量，满足基本建设需要。省人民监察委员会准备在冬训前后，在建筑工人中发展一批人民监察通讯员。省财政厅决定加强基本建设财务工作的检查，做好财政监督工作，建立财政制度，精确计算成本，保证基本建设任务的完成。中共松江省委宣传部和省人民政府卫生厅，更进一步订出了为基本建设服务的具体计划。如省委宣传部在计划中规定：基本建设方面的宣传工作由一个部长专门领导，各处也指定专人负责；领导干部并要经常深入公司和工地及时发现与解决问题；规定了部务会议和处务会议要定期研究有关基本建设的宣传工作。省卫生厅的计划也订得非常具体。他们提出要帮助工地培养卫生、保健人员；各工地需要干部时，决尽最大力量予以支持；要组织小型巡回医疗队深入工地，帮助开展卫生工作；在主要的医院指定床位，专门接收基本建设工人。
    但是，也有些部门，如中共松江省委组织部、农村工作部，省人民政府人事厅、民政厅、农业厅、林业厅、公路局、邮电局、电业局、省银行、法院等单位，检查得还不深刻；或者还没有提出改进办法和订出具体计划；有的甚至还没有检查这项工作。
