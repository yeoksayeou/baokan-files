    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Strengthens Leadership over Patriotic Health Campaign
    In order to strengthen leadership over the Patriotic Health Campaign, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has been officially established. The chairman of the committee is Ulanhu, Chairman of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, and the vice-chairmen are Yang Zhilin, Vice Chairman, and Li Benzhou, Minister of Health. In mid-February, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government and the actual conditions of the region, issued instructions on continuing to carry out the Patriotic Health Campaign. The instructions required all health workers and people in the region to clearly understand the great significance of this campaign, and to carry out the Patriotic Health Campaign universally, deeply and persistently on the basis of the original work, and proposed that from mid-March to the end of April, a spring health campaign should be carried out in conjunction with the preparation for spring plowing.
    Significant Development in Maternal and Child Health Work in Xinjiang Province
    There has been significant development in maternal and child health work in Xinjiang Province. Over the past three years, the province has transformed and trained more than 2,500 old midwives and new-style accoucheurs from various ethnic groups. Nine maternal and child health stations have been established, along with 109 delivery stations and delivery teams. Last autumn, the People's Government also sent maternal and child health work teams to work in Jinghua, Fukang, and other counties, using slides, dramas, and other forms to conduct publicity, so that more than 13,000 people received maternal and child health education.
    In the past, people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province generally used old-style delivery methods, and many mothers died from puerperal fever and infants died from tetanus. Over the past three years, after the promotion of new-style delivery methods in various places, some areas have greatly reduced the incidence and mortality rates of mothers and infants. For example, after Aksu County trained midwives, in a statistical study of 72 deliveries, only two infants died due to insufficient gestation, and the remaining mothers and infants were safe. After the implementation of new-style delivery in Turpan County, the infant mortality rate has been reduced from 28.5 percent to 1.6 percent.
