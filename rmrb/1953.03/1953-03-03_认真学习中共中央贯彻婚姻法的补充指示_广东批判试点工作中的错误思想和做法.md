Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd. The Guangdong Province Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee Office, at a recent provincial pilot experience reporting conference on the implementation of the Marriage Law, studied the CCP Central Committee’s supplementary instructions on the Marriage Law Movement Month work, and, according to the spirit of the instructions, examined and criticized erroneous thoughts and practices in the pilot work.

Various areas of Guangdong Province have successively carried out pilot work in the movement to implement the Marriage Law. However, the cadres leading the pilot work had very vague understanding of the nature, guidelines, requirements, and policy issues that must be paid attention to in this movement. Some cadres believed that to make a movement grand and deeply rooted in people's hearts, it was necessary to "struggle against a group" and "kill one as a warning to a hundred." In Bao'an County, pilot work was moved twice to find targets for public trials. Dongguan, Xingning and other counties also prepared to open up the situation by holding public trial meetings. Many counties had moved the experience of class struggle in land reform, and mistakenly put forward the slogan "Rely on widows, child brides, young women and harmonious families, unite with parents and husbands who have made mistakes, and crack down on those who seriously violate the Marriage Law." Some mistakenly proposed that in this movement, it is necessary to achieve "having concern, having management, having judgment, having divorce, and having marriage."

The working cadres who participated in this meeting, after studying the supplementary instructions of the CCP Central Committee, all reviewed the above-mentioned erroneous thoughts and practices and immediately tried to correct them. The working cadres from Dongguan County who attended the meeting immediately called back to the county to urge the correction of erroneous practices. The county head of the county people's government also replied when he received the call that after seeing the CCP Central Committee’s supplementary instructions, he had withdrawn the previous erroneous notice and was not prepared to blindly engage in public trial meetings. Many cadres reviewed their impetuous emotions and criticized the erroneous practices of wanting to solve all family disputes in one movement, as well as household-by-household comparisons and family rankings. When summarizing the pilot work, the Qujiang County work team regarded the fact that it had resolved more than 100 family disputes and rated and published the types of each family as a great achievement and successful experience. Only now did they realize that the results of the rating not only did not solve the problem, but instead created chaos. There were also individual cadres who used to think that the Marriage Law Movement Month was just "handling happy events," and that the work team acted as matchmakers in disguise. When working cadres in Nanhai County went to the countryside to carry out pilot work, they "cultivated" five pairs of men and women to prepare for marriage, and even mobilized a 17-year-old girl who was not old enough to get married. After this study, they immediately corrected this error.

    认真学习中共中央贯彻婚姻法的补充指示
    广东批判试点工作中的错误思想和做法
    【新华社广州二日电】广东省贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室在最近召开全省各地贯彻婚姻法试点经验汇报会议时，对中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示进行了学习，并根据指示的精神，检查和批判了试点工作中的错误思想及做法。
    广东省各地在贯彻婚姻法运动中已先后进行了试点工作，但领导试点工作的干部对这次运动的性质、方针、要求和必须注意的一些政策问题，认识非常模糊。有的干部认为一个运动要大张旗鼓，深入人心，就要“斗争一批”，“杀一儆百”。宝安县试点工作为了要找公审对象，接连换了两次地方；东莞、兴宁等县也准备以召开公审大会来轰开局面。许多县曾搬用土地改革中阶级斗争的经验，错误地提出“依靠寡妇、童养媳、青年妇女以及和睦家庭，团结犯错误的家长、丈夫，打击严重违反婚姻法者”的口号；有的错误地提出这次运动中要做到“有关、有管、有判、有离、有结婚”。
    参加这次会议的工作干部学习了中共中央的补充指示后，都对上述错误思想和做法进行了检讨，并立即设法纠正。东莞县参加会议的工作干部马上打电话回县督促纠正错误作法。该县人民政府县长在接到电话时也回答说，他在见到中共中央补充指示后，已收回以前错误的通知，不准备盲目地搞公审会了。很多干部检讨了自己的急躁情绪，批判了想在一个运动中解决所有家庭纠纷问题，以及挨户评比、家庭排队等错误的做法。曲江县工作队试点总结时，曾把一共解决了一百多件家庭纠纷、每家都评定类型发榜的事，认为是很大的成绩和成功的经验；这次才认识了：评比的结果，不仅没有解决问题，相反地造成混乱。也有个别干部过去认为贯彻婚姻法运动月就是“办办喜事”，工作队做变相媒人。南海县的工作干部下乡进行试点工作时，就“培养”五对男女准备结婚，甚至还动员一个不够结婚年龄的十七岁的女青年结婚。这次学习后，他们便立刻纠正了这个错误。
