Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 28th. Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, replied to General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, on March 28, agreeing to the suggestion made in Clark's letter of February 22 regarding the prior exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war by both sides during the war, and suggesting that representatives of both sides should immediately resume negotiations at Panmunjom. Liaison officers from both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations met at 2:00 PM on March 28th, and our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhu Ran, handed the letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai to the opposing chief liaison officer, Colonel Carrock, for transmission to General Clark.

The full text of the letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai is as follows:
General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command:

	Your letter of February 22, 1953, has been received.

	Regarding the issue of prioritizing the repatriation of seriously ill and wounded prisoners of war from both sides, the negotiating representatives of both sides had already reached an agreement in Article 53 of the draft Korean Armistice Agreement based on humanitarian principles. However, this agreement could not be implemented due to the interruption of the Korean armistice negotiations, resulting in the failure to repatriate seriously ill and wounded prisoners of war from both sides to this day.

	Now that your side has expressed its readiness to implement the provisions of the Geneva Convention for sick and wounded prisoners of war held by both sides, we, in order to express the same desire, fully agree to your suggestion regarding the prior exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war by both sides during the war. This suggestion should be handled in accordance with Article 109 of the Geneva Convention. At the same time, we believe that the reasonable resolution of the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war during the war should lead to the smooth resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue, so that the Korean armistice desired by the people of the world can be realized. Therefore, we suggest that the negotiating representatives of both sides should immediately resume negotiations at Panmunjom, and our liaison officers are prepared to meet with your liaison officers to agree on a date for the resumption of negotiations.

						Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
						Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
						March 28, 1953

Attached is General Clark's letter:
To Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

	In a resolution passed on December 13, 1952, in Geneva, Switzerland, the Executive Committee of the International Red Cross called upon both sides in the Korean conflict, as a sign of good faith, to take immediate action to implement the humanitarian provisions of the Geneva Convention and repatriate sick and wounded prisoners of war in accordance with the relevant articles of the Geneva Convention. As has been repeatedly stated to you during the Panmunjom negotiations, the United Nations Command has strictly adhered to the humanitarian provisions of the Geneva Convention from the outset and, specifically, is prepared to implement the provisions of the Geneva Convention for sick and wounded prisoners of war in its custody. The United Nations Command is now prepared to immediately repatriate those seriously ill and wounded captured personnel who are fit to travel in accordance with Article 109 of the Geneva Convention. I would like you to inform me whether your side is prepared to immediately repatriate seriously ill and wounded captured personnel of the United Nations Command in your hands. Liaison officers of the United Nations Command will be prepared to meet with your liaison officers to fairly ascertain the situation and to make the necessary arrangements for the mutual exchange of such seriously ill and wounded persons in accordance with Article 109 of the Geneva Convention.

United Nations Command Commander, General of the Army Mark Clark (signed)

    金日成元帅和彭德怀将军函复克拉克
    同意双方先行交换病伤战俘
    并建议立即在板门店恢复停战谈判
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】　朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在三月二十八日函复联合国军总司令克拉克将军，对克拉克二月二十二日来信所提出的关于在战争期间先行交换双方病伤战俘的建议表示同意，并建议双方代表应即恢复板门店谈判。朝鲜停战谈判双方联络官在三月二十八日下午二时会晤，我方首席联络官朱然上校将金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的信交给对方首席联络官卡洛克上校转交克拉克将军。
    金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的信全文如下：联合国军总司令克拉克将军：
    一九五三年二月二十二日你的来信收到了。
    关于优先遣返双方重病重伤战俘问题，双方谈判代表本已根据人道原则达成朝鲜停战协定草案第五十三款的协议。只因朝鲜停战谈判中断，此项协议无法实现，致双方重病重伤战俘至今未能遣返。
    现在你方既然表示准备对双方收容下的病伤战俘实施日内瓦公约的规定，我方为表示同一愿望起见，完全同意你方所提出的关于在战争期间先行交换双方病伤战俘的建议。这个建议应按照日内瓦公约第一百零九条的规定处理。同时，我们认为关于在战争期间交换双方病伤战俘的问题的合理解决，应当使之引导到全部战俘问题的顺利解决，使世界人民所渴望的朝鲜停战得以实现。因此，我方建议：双方谈判代表应即恢复在板门店的谈判，我方联络官并准备与你方联络官进行会晤，以商定恢复谈判的日期。
                        朝鲜人民军最高司令官　金日成
                        中国人民志愿军司令员　彭德怀
                         一九五三年三月二十八日
    附克拉克将军的来信：朝鲜人民军金日成最高司令官、中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员：
    国际红十字协会执行委员会在一九五二年十二月十三日在瑞士日内瓦通过的一项决议案中，呼吁在朝鲜冲突中的双方作为善意的表示，立即采取行动，实行日内瓦公约的人道主义规定，按照日内瓦公约的有关条款遣返病伤战俘。如在板门店谈判过程中一再向你申述的，联合国军从一开始就严谨地遵守日内瓦公约的人道主义规定，具体而言，已准备好对在它收容下的病伤战俘实施日内瓦公约的规定。联合国军现仍准备按照日内瓦公约第一百零九条的规定，立即遣返那些身体适于旅行的重病重伤被俘人员。我希望你们通知我，你们方面是否已准备好立即进行遣返在你们手中的联合国军重病重伤的被俘人员。联合国军联络官将准备与你方联络官会晤，以为公正地查明情况，并为按照日内瓦公约第一百零九条的规定而相互交换此种重病重伤者作必要的安排。
    联合国军总司令美国陆军上将克拉克　（签字）
