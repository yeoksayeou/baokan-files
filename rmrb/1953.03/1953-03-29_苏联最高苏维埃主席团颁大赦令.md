Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 28th. TASS, Moscow, March 28th: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has issued a decree of amnesty. The full text is as follows:

    Due to the consolidation of the Soviet social and state system, the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards, the enhancement of citizens' awareness, and their honest attitude in fulfilling their civic responsibilities; the state's legal system and socialist law and order have been consolidated, and crime has been greatly reduced.

    The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR believes that, under these circumstances, prisoners who have committed crimes that do not constitute a great danger to the state, and who can prove by their honest attitude at work that they can live an honest labor life again and become useful members of society, need no longer be detained in places of detention.

    The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR hereby orders:

    1.  Prisoners sentenced to deprivation of liberty for five years or less shall be released from places of detention and shall be exempt from other penalties unrelated to deprivation of liberty.

    2.  Prisoners who have committed crimes of malfeasance, economic crimes, and military crimes listed in Article 193, Paragraph 4(a), Article 193, Paragraph 7, Article 193, Paragraph 8, Article 193, Paragraph 10, Article 193, Paragraph 10(a), Article 193, Paragraph 14, Article 193, Paragraph 15, Article 193, Paragraph 16, Article 193, Paragraph 17 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, and the corresponding articles of the Criminal Codes of other Union Republics, shall be released from places of detention, regardless of the length of their sentence.

    3.  The following prisoners shall be released from places of detention, regardless of the length of their sentence: women and pregnant women with children under the age of ten; juveniles under the age of eighteen; men over the age of fifty-five and women over the age of fifty; and prisoners suffering from incurable serious illnesses.

    4.  The sentences of prisoners sentenced to deprivation of liberty for more than five years shall be reduced by half.

    5.  All investigations of the following types of criminal acts committed prior to the promulgation of this order, and the examination of such cases that have not yet been reviewed by the courts, shall be terminated:

        a. Criminal acts for which the law stipulates a sentence of deprivation of liberty for five years or less, or other penalties not involving detention;

        b. Crimes of malfeasance, economic crimes, and military crimes listed in Article 2 of this order;

        c. Crimes committed by prisoners listed in Article 3 of this order.

    Regarding criminal acts committed prior to the promulgation of this order for which the law stipulates a sentence of deprivation of liberty for more than five years, if the court deems it necessary to impose a sentence of deprivation of liberty for five years or less, the penalty shall be waived; but if the court deems it necessary to impose a sentence of deprivation of liberty for more than five years, the sentence shall be reduced by half.

    6.  For citizens who have previously been tried and have served their sentences, or who should be released from punishment early due to the promulgation of this order, the verdict of guilt and deprivation of voting rights shall be revoked.

    7.  The amnesty shall not apply to prisoners sentenced to deprivation of liberty for more than five years for counter-revolutionary crimes, theft of large amounts of socialist property, robbery, and murder.

    8.  It is deemed necessary to amend the criminal laws of the USSR and the Union Republics in order to replace criminal liability for crimes of malfeasance, economic crimes, crimes disrupting public order, and other less dangerous crimes with administrative and disciplinary measures, and to reduce criminal liability for certain criminal offenses.

    The Ministry of Justice of the USSR is hereby instructed to formulate corresponding proposals within one month, submit them to the Council of Ministers of the USSR for review, and then submit them to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

        (Signed) K. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR
                 N. Begov, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR

    苏联最高苏维埃主席团颁大赦令
    【新华社二十八日讯】　塔斯社莫斯科二十八日电：苏联最高苏维埃主席团颁布大赦令，全文如下：
    由于苏维埃社会和国家制度的巩固，人民物质和文化水平的提高，公民觉悟的提高及其履行公民责任的诚实态度；国家的法定制度和社会主义法律与秩序已经巩固，犯罪已经大大减少。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团认为，在这种情况下，凡曾犯有并不构成对国家的巨大危险的罪行、而又能以其在工作中的诚实态度证明其可以重过诚实的劳动生活并成为社会上有用成员的犯人，已毋需将其继续拘留在拘留处所。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团兹特命令：
    一、将判处剥夺自由五年以及五年以下的犯人从拘留处所释放，并免除与剥夺自由无关的其他刑罚。
    二、凡犯有渎职罪、经济罪及俄罗斯联邦刑法第一九三条第四款甲项、第一九三条第七款、第一九三条第八款、第一九三条第十款、第一九三条第十款甲项、第一九三条第十四款、第一九三条第十五款、第一九三条第十六款、第一九三条第十七款以及其他加盟共和国刑法的相应条款中所列军职罪的犯人，不论其刑期长短，一律从拘留处所释放。
    三、将下列犯人从拘留处所释放，不论其刑期长短：有十岁以下之儿女的妇女和孕妇；十八岁以下的少年；五十五岁以上的男人和五十岁以上的妇女以及患有不治之重病的犯人。
    四、将判处剥夺自由五年以上的犯人的刑期减半。
    五、对于在本命令颁布以前的下列各类犯罪行为，停止一切侦讯以及法院尚未审查的此类案件的审查：
    甲、法律规定判处剥夺自由五年及五年以下或不包括拘留的其他刑罚的犯罪行为；
    乙、本命令第二项中所列的渎职罪、经济罪及军职罪；
    丙、本命令第三项中所列的犯人所犯的罪。
    关于法律规定判处剥夺自由五年以上的在本命令尚未颁布以前的犯罪行为，如法院认为有必要判处剥夺自由五年或五年以下者，免罚；但如法院认为有必要判处剥夺自由五年以上者，将刑期减半。
    六、对于从前已受审并已服刑的公民，或由于本命令的颁布而应提前免除刑罚的公民，撤销其罪名及剥夺选举权的判决。
    七、大赦不适用于因反革命罪、盗窃巨额社会主义财产罪、抢劫罪及谋杀罪而被判处剥夺自由五年以上的犯人。
    八、认为有必要修改苏联及各加盟共和国的刑法，以便以行政处分和纪律措施来代替对渎职罪、经济罪、妨害公共秩序罪及其他危险性较小的罪行所负的刑事责任，并减轻若干刑事罪的刑事责任。
    兹指令苏联司法部在一月内拟出相应的建议，提交苏联部长会议审议后交苏联最高苏维埃主席团。
