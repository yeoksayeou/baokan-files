The Ministry of Railways Survey and Design Personnel Hold a Symposium
Examining Ideology to Review Errors of Inferior Survey and Design Quality

    Following the exposure in this newspaper of erroneous designs by the Northeast First Ceramics Factory and Tongguanshan in Anhui, some survey and design personnel from various regional design bureaus and survey and design corps under the Ministry of Railways convened a symposium on January 25 to examine the low quality of survey and design work in new line construction and to conduct preliminary ideological criticism.

    The speeches at the symposium reflected that the low quality of survey and design work for new lines was a very serious problem.

    Many designers did not pay attention to the necessary design data for bridges, culverts, hydrology, geology, and construction organization. When designing the southern section of the Tiancheng Railway, a technician lacking construction experience was sent to investigate construction organization. They blindly believed that the sand from the Baishui River could be used for the key project of the Baishui River Bridge, estimating the transport distance to be only five kilometers. However, after inspection by the construction department, it was found that the sand from the Baishui River could not be used for concrete at all and had to be transported from a place twelve kilometers away. Fortunately, the construction department discovered this early, averting a potential work stoppage due to lack of materials.

    Some designers were perfunctory in collecting design data. For example, Soviet experts suggested that when calculating flood levels for bridge and culvert design, if historical data were unavailable, at least three reliable people should be interviewed, detailed records should be made, and their addresses and occupations should be verified to assess the accuracy of the flood level data they provided. The survey and design personnel of the Third Survey and Design Corps of the North China Design Bureau also knew that investigating flood levels was an important basis for designing the location of bridges and culverts, and that errors in flood level investigation would affect the safety of the bridge or cause waste. However, when designing bridges and culverts for new lines, they determined the flood level after consulting only one person.

    Some designers also "revise" their blind designs, but these "revisions" are equally blind. For example, the bridge and culvert design for the Tianlan Railway initially decided to use concrete entirely. Later, upon hearing that materials should be sourced locally, it was decided to change everything to stone. After investigation, it was found that there was not enough qualified stone, and the design had to be modified again.

    Poor design quality directly affected the quality of new line construction projects. Furthermore, due to the modification of erroneous designs, time, manpower, and resources were wasted, further delaying construction.

    At the symposium, survey and design personnel linked the above errors to ideology and criticized them. From the perspective of the designers' thinking, the reasons for the poor design quality were as follows:

    First, some survey and design personnel have not yet established the view that design should be responsible to construction. In the era of Kuomintang rule, if the construction department accepted the design documents from the design department and then discovered design errors, or if construction losses were caused by design errors, the design department would not be held responsible. The ideological influence of this system still remains in some survey and design personnel. They lack a high sense of responsibility and a spirit of being responsible to the end. Without considering the actual construction situation, they submit the design. Engineer Lei Congmin of the Southwest Design Bureau said: "We are often satisfied with rough data and always think that we designed without these data in the past anyway. Because of this thinking, errors are made."

    Second, some survey and design personnel believe that obeying a certain person is more important than obeying the truth and obeying science. Maintaining one's dignity is more important than maintaining the truth and maintaining science. They even refuse to correct errors they know are wrong. The dispute over the realignment of the Ya'er Gorge section of the Tianlan Railway is an example. The roadbed in the Ya'er Gorge section was built before liberation, and no one took care of it for several years, so a part of it was damaged by floods. At that time, Wang Juqian, the current deputy director of the new line construction bureau, suggested considering surveying a new line on the south bank of the river. Zhou Zhu, the section chief of the Longxi section, based on this suggestion, surveyed a new line on the south bank of the river. This new line required passing through a 500-meter tunnel, which was a difficult project. Everyone believed that the new line was not as good as the old line. However, Zhou Zhu believed that the new line was Deputy Director Wang Juqian's idea, so he insisted on taking the new line and exaggerated the economic value of the new line when conducting the economic survey. Due to Zhou Zhu's insistence, construction started on the new line, and 40,000 to 50,000 cubic meters of earth and stone were moved. Finally, everyone raised objections, pointing out that the old line was flatter than the new line, and flood prevention could be achieved by implementing some protection measures. Deputy Director Wang Juqian also clarified that he only suggested surveying on the south bank of the river and did not mean that a new line must be opened on the south bank. Only then did Zhou Zhu abandon this idea and revert to construction on the north bank. Pan Xueqin, deputy director of the Northwest Design Bureau, also said when recalling the design of the Tianlan and Baotian Railways: "At that time, our thinking was very chaotic. Everyone had their own experiences and opinions, and there were many disputes. However, it was not entirely based on work. Insisting on one's opinion was only for personal gain, and everyone believed that whoever persisted to the end would win. Therefore, everyone did not consider choosing a reasonable line based on the actual situation, but instead made random slogans. Some insisted on fighting the mountains, shifting the line towards the mountains and building more tunnels. Some advocated fighting the water, shifting the line outwards and building more protection projects."

    Third, some people have a one-sided view of tasks. Leaders often demand excessively tight schedules for design work, and survey and design personnel often only consider the speed of design, resulting in poor design quality and rework, which actually extends the design time. When the Third Survey and Design Corps was surveying a line in Shandong, the person planting the flags followed the map without carefully studying the terrain, so that when the design was done, it was discovered that a large marshalling yard, three kilometers long and one kilometer wide, was located in the mountains. As a result, they had to spend another two days re-surveying twelve kilometers of the line. On the Baoji-Lüeyang line, one survey and design team worked very quickly, but failed to collect data such as the drainage area of bridges, so they had to re-survey.

    Fourth, the thinking of some survey and design personnel is still limited to a narrow circle. They cannot yet consider survey and design work from the perspective of the national economic construction situation. Yan Tiesheng, the design team leader of the First Survey and Design Corps, said: "Our task was to survey and design a forest railway in the Northeast. When the superiors assigned the task, the engineers did it very carefully. We only thought that building a railway required surveying and designing, and surveying and designing was for building a railway. However, we did not consider, based on the needs of national economic construction and local transportation conditions, whether we should build a broad-gauge or narrow-gauge railway. It was only after the Soviet experts instructed us that we investigated the economic situation and made a comparison of broad and narrow gauges for the leaders to decide. Otherwise, it would have been another blind design."

    At the symposium, many survey and design personnel expressed their intention to seriously examine their thinking, learn from advanced Soviet experiences, and do a good job in the survey and design of new lines.

### 铁道部勘测设计人员举行座谈会  联系思想检查勘测设计质量低劣的错误

    铁道部勘测设计人员举行座谈会
    联系思想检查勘测设计质量低劣的错误
    在本报揭发了东北第一陶瓷厂和安徽铜官山的错误设计之后，中央人民政府铁道部所属各地区设计分局及各勘测设计总队的部分勘测设计人员，在一月二十五日举行座谈会，检查新线建设中勘测设计质量低劣等错误，并初步联系思想，进行了批判。
    座谈会上的发言，反映出新线勘测设计工作质量低劣的情况十分严重。
    许多设计人员根本不重视桥涵、水文、地质、施工组织等必要设计资料的调查。设计天成路南段时，派去作施工组织调查工作的，是缺少施工经验的技术员。他们盲目地认为白水河的沙子可用来做重点工程白水河桥梁，估计运输路程只有五公里，但经施工部门检查，白水河的沙子根本不能做混凝土，还得另从十二里外的地方运沙子来。幸亏施工部门发现较早，才没有造成停工待料的恶果。
    有的设计人员收集设计资料时，敷衍了事。如苏联专家建议桥涵设计中计算洪水位时，如果没有历史资料，至少要找三个较可靠的人进行调查，做出详细的记录，要考核他们的住址、职业，研究他们所供给的洪水位资料的准确性。华北设计分局第三勘测设计总队的勘测设计人员也知道调查洪水位是设计桥涵位置的重要根据，洪水位调查错误就影响桥梁的安全或造成浪费，但他们在作新线的桥涵设计时，只询问了一个人就确定了洪水位。
    有的设计人员也“修正”自己的盲目的设计，但这种“修正”也同样是盲目的。如天兰路的桥涵设计，原来决定全部用混凝土，后来听说要就地取材，又决定全部改成石料，经过调查，并没有这样多合格的石料，不得不又修改设计。
    设计质量低劣，一方面直接影响了新线建设工程的质量，一方面由于更改错误的设计，浪费了时间、人力和物力，更延迟了施工的时间。
    座谈会上，勘测设计人员都联系思想批判了上述错误。从设计人员的思想上来检查，造成设计质量低劣的原因有下列几点：
    第一、有些勘测设计人员还没有树立设计应对施工负责的观点。国民党统治时代，施工部门接受了设计部门的设计文件以后，再发现设计错误，或由于设计错误而造成施工方面的损失，设计部门可不负责任。这种制度的思想影响还残留在一些勘测设计人员当中。他们没有高度的责任心，没有负责到底的精神，不估计施工的实际情况，就把设计交出。西南设计分局雷从民工程师说：“我们常常满足于概略的资料，总认为从前没有这些资料也一样设计，因为有这种思想，便造成了错误。”
    第二、有些勘测设计人员认为服从某一个人，比服从真理、服从科学重要；维护自己的尊严比维护真理、维护科学重要，甚至明知错了，也不改正。天兰路鸭儿峡的改线争论就是一个实例。鸭儿峡一段路基在解放前即已修成，有几年没有人管，让洪水冲坏了一部分。当时，现任新线施工局副局长汪菊潜曾提出是不是可以考虑在河的南岸再勘测一条线路，陇西段段长周铸根据这句话，就在河的南岸勘测了一条新线。这条新线要穿过一座五百公尺的山洞，工程艰巨，大家都认为新线并没有老线好，但周铸认为新线是汪菊潜副局长的意见，一定要走新线，而且在做经济调查时又夸大新线的经济价值。由于周铸的坚持，在新线开了工，做了四、五万土石方工程。最后，大家提出意见，指出老线比新线平坦，只要作一些防护工程，就可防范洪水。汪菊潜副局长也申明他只是建议在河的南岸勘测一下，并不是认为一定要在南岸开条新线，周铸才放弃了这个意见，重新改在北岸施工。西北设计分局副局长潘学勤在回忆天兰、宝天两路的设计时也说：“那时候我们的思想非常混乱。各有各的经验和主张，各人坚持各人的意见，争论很多，但并不完全是从工作出发，坚持意见只是考虑个人的得失，并且认为谁坚持到最后，谁的意见就会胜利。因此，大家都不考虑根据实际情况来选择合理的线路，而是乱提口号。有的坚持与山斗争，线路向山移，多作隧道，有的主张与水斗争，线路向外移，多作防护工程。”
    第三、有的人有片面的任务观点。领导干部对设计工作时间的要求常常过于紧迫，勘测设计人员又常常只考虑设计速度，因而使设计质量低劣，造成返工，实际上更延长了设计的时间。第三勘测设计总队在勘测山东的一条线路时，插大旗的人看着图插过去，并没有好好研究地形，以致做设计时，发现长三公里、宽一公里的一个大编组站被测在山岭中。结果不得不再花两天时间，重测了十二公里线路。在宝鸡至略阳线，有一个勘测设计分队工作进度很快，但却没有收集桥梁汇水面积等资料，只得重新再作测量。
    第四、有些勘测设计人员的思想还局限在狭小的圈子里，他们还不能从祖国经济建设的形势来考虑勘测设计工作。第一勘测设计总队设计组组长严铁生说：“我们的任务是勘测设计一条东北的森林线。上级交来任务，工程师做得很仔细，我们只认为修铁路就要勘测设计，勘测设计为了修铁路，却没有考虑根据国家经济建设的需要和当地运输情况，究竟是应该修宽线，还是修狭线。经苏联专家指示，才调查了经济情况，作了宽狭比较线，供领导决定。不然，又是一次盲目设计。”
    座谈会上，许多勘测设计人员都表示要认真检查思想，学习苏联先进经验，作好新线勘测设计工作。
