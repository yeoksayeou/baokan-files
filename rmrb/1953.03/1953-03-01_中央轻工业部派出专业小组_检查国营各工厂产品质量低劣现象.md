Xinhua News Agency, 28th. To correct the serious phenomenon of inferior product quality existing in some state-owned and local state-owned light industrial factories, the Central Ministry of Light Industry has organized specialized inspection teams for rubber, papermaking, and cigarette production, which were dispatched to factories in late February for focused inspections.

The quality of products from some state-owned and local state-owned light industrial factories in rubber, papermaking, cigarette production, and pharmaceuticals was very poor in 1952. For example, many rubber factories produced automobile tires in 1952 that had defects such as detachment, bursting, and insufficient wear resistance. The problem of rubber shoes with broken soles and cracked surfaces was particularly prominent, with many shoes being called "Sunday shoes" and "heartbreak shoes" by the people. The State-Owned Northeast No. 8 Rubber Factory produced 875,000 pairs of cotton rubber shoes last year, all of which were of poor quality. Many users therefore wrote to the Northeast Daily News requesting the rubber factory to correct this phenomenon. In the papermaking industry, many factories produced paper that had many defects in appearance, and the paper's uniformity and tensile strength were also insufficient. The State-Owned Xuanhua Paper Mill produced a large number of rejects and substandard products in the third quarter of last year. The Papermaking Industry Administration Bureau's working group inspected four reams of poster paper produced on September 30th of last year, and the ream with the most defects had 52 bad sheets; the ream with the fewest defects had 5 bad sheets. In the cigarette industry, the quality of products from some factories has also declined significantly. The Zhonghua and Hademen brands, which were originally highly regarded in the market, have seen a sharp decline in quality, resulting in fewer users and large quantities of unsold products.

The reasons for the above-mentioned inferior product quality are: 1. The bureaucratic work style of leading cadres and the erroneous idea of ​​disregarding quality. For example, Gao Guangjian, Director of the Rubber Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Light Industry, and Wu Linghai, Chief of the Production Section, did not go deep into the factories to understand the actual situation on weekdays. When a reporter from the Northeast Daily News visited them to ask about the poor quality of rubber shoes from the No. 8 Rubber Factory, they both believed that the poor quality of cotton rubber shoes produced by the No. 8 Rubber Factory was only an isolated phenomenon. In order to rush production tasks, the deputy director of the No. 8 Rubber Factory once told the inspectors to relax their inspections. When inspectors discovered substandard products and brought them to the attention of the workshop director, some workshop directors said, "You only care about quality, you also have to take care of quantity!" The inspectors then relaxed their inspections, which led to a decline in product quality. 2. Only focusing on production and not on management. The products of some state-owned factories are purchased and sold exclusively by trade departments. The leaders of these factories never ask about product sales, but only shut themselves in the factory to bury themselves in "increasing production and practicing economy," and are only shocked when products are heavily stockpiled. 3. Weak technical management. Many state-owned and local state-owned light industrial factories do not have strict quality standards and inspection and acceptance systems; there are no technical operating procedures in the manufacturing process; or if they exist, they are only a formality. The two main workshops of the No. 8 Rubber Factory—the rubber mixing workshop and the molding workshop—have long lacked a formal inspection system. After defective products are produced, not only can the person responsible not be found, but even the production team cannot be found. In addition, chaos in operating methods, lack of specific technical measures plans, and failure to organize rhythmic production are also reasons for inferior product quality.

### 中央轻工业部派出专业小组  检查国营各工厂产品质量低劣现象

    中央轻工业部派出专业小组
    检查国营各工厂产品质量低劣现象
    【新华社二十八日讯】中央人民政府轻工业部为纠正目前若干国营和地方国营轻工业工厂存在的严重的产品质量低劣现象，已组织橡胶、造纸、卷烟等专业检查小组在二月下旬分别下厂进行重点检查。
    一九五二年某些国营和地方国营的橡胶、造纸、卷烟、制药等轻工业工厂产品的质量很低劣。如不少橡胶工厂一九五二年所产汽车轮胎有脱胶、爆裂和耐磨力不足等缺点。胶鞋断底裂面情况尤其突出，很多鞋被群众称为“礼拜鞋”和“伤心鞋”。国营东北第八橡胶厂去年出产的八十七万五千双棉胶鞋，质量都很差。很多用户因此写信给东北日报要求橡胶厂纠正这种现象。在造纸工业方面不少工厂所产纸张除在外观上存在很多缺点外，纸张匀度和拉力也很不够。国营宣化造纸厂在去年第三季生产了大量废品和次品。造纸工业管理局工作小组下厂检查了去年九月三十日生产的四令招贴纸，其中最多的一令有五十二张坏纸；最少的也有五张坏纸。在卷烟工业方面，某些工厂的产品质量也降低很多。原来在市场上享有盛誉的中华牌、哈德门等香烟由于质量锐降，用户减少，大批产品卖不出去。
    造成上述产品质量低劣的原因是：一、领导干部的官僚主义作风和轻视质量的错误思想。如中央轻工业部橡胶工业管理局局长高光鉴和生产科科长吴令海，平日没有深入工厂去了解实际情况，当东北日报记者就橡胶八厂胶鞋质量低劣问题前往访问时，还一致认为橡胶八厂所产棉胶鞋质量不好只是个别现象。橡胶八厂为了赶生产任务，有一次副厂长竟叫检查员放松检查。检查人员发现不合规格的产品提请车间主任注意时，有的车间主任却说：“你们光顾质量，也得照顾照顾数量呀！”检查人员也就放松了检查，以致产品质量下降。二、只问生产、不问经营。有些国营厂的产品是由贸易部门收购和包销的。这些厂的领导人员从来不问产品销售情况，只是关在厂子里埋头“增产节约”，一直到产品大量积压，才大吃一惊。三、技术管理薄弱。很多国营和地方国营的轻工业工厂还没有严格的质量规格标准和检查验收制度；在制造过程中还没有技术操作规程；或者虽有而徒具形式。橡胶八厂两个主要车间——制胶车间和成型车间长期没有正规的检查制度，出了废品后，不但找不到负责人，甚至找不到那一个班生产的。此外如操作方法上的混乱、没有具体的技术措施计划、没有组织有节奏的生产等也是造成产品质量低劣的原因。
