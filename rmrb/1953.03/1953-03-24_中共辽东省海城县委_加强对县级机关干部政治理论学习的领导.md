The CCP Haicheng County Committee of Liaodong Province
Strengthens Leadership Over Political Theory Study of County-Level机关 Cadres

According to the Northeast Daily: The CCP Haicheng County Committee of Liaodong Province attaches importance to the theoretical study of in-service cadres in county-level 机关, has equipped and enriched the forces leading the study, and improved the study organization, making the political theory study of cadres regular. The formal political theory study of cadres in the county began on the basis of the ideological construction of the "Three-Anti" campaign last year. At the beginning, Li Ruzhou, the county party secretary, instructed the party committees of various 机关 to strengthen the leadership of cadres' theoretical study, stipulating that no one should arbitrarily encroach on study time, and other systems to ensure the implementation of the study system from top to bottom. Since then, the county party committee has regularly cared about cadres' theoretical study, and conscientiously studied and solved some problems related to leading and organizing cadres' study, and tried its best to solve the problem of full-time and part-time teachers. At present, the county has equipped five full-time theory teachers with high quality and good explanation ability, and plans to add two more if possible in the future. In addition to adhering to theoretical study and serving as part-time teachers in intermediate groups, many county party committee ministers and members can also understand and supervise cadres' theoretical study when inspecting work.

In order to strengthen the various organizational work of the 机关 school, grasp the progress of cadres' theoretical study in detail, check the problems existing in the study of various units directly under the county at any time, and for the purpose of close contact between the upper and lower levels, the county party committee has specially set up two full-time cadres to be responsible for the theoretical study of the intermediate group, the primary group first and second classes, which not only solved the difficulties in the management of the 机关 school, but also strengthened the guiding force of cadres' theoretical study. In addition, the county party committee also paid attention to the guidance of study. Before each chapter is taught by the teacher, the party branch convenes a meeting of tutors to study the center and key points of the text, exchange experience in tutoring work, study the ideological situation of the students, and study how to help the students digest the content of the lectures and improve their ideological understanding. In addition to strengthening the organization and leadership of the study, the county party committee also paid attention to realizing ideological leadership, correcting the bias of the study, correcting the attitude of the study, and helping to clarify the problems in the study. For example, when summarizing the study at the end of last year, the Minister of Propaganda of the County Party Committee made a report on the ideological problems in the study, clarified some incorrect understandings, and corrected the attitude of the study. For another example, in the past, when teaching basic knowledge of social science about class and class struggle, Gao Lubin, member of the CCP Haicheng County Committee and County Mayor of Haicheng, gave specific guidance on several issues that the lecturer did not explain clearly.

Because the county party committee attaches importance to the political theory study of cadres, and strengthens the organization and leadership and ideological leadership, the participants have a basic understanding of political theory, and can use these understandings to connect with their own thoughts and work, thus improving their level of consciousness and political responsibility. After the study, everyone commonly realized that only by studying hard can we do our work well and improve our ideological awareness. Now there are very few people who think that "it doesn't matter whether you study or not". In the study, everyone can listen carefully, take notes, and speak actively at the discussion meetings. For example, Wang Yongqiang of the County People's Bank used to be reluctant to study, thinking that it was the same whether he studied or not, and he held a perfunctory attitude whether in discussion or self-study. Later, due to the continuous education of the Party, he corrected his attitude towards study, worked hard to improve his awareness, joined the Communist Youth League, and was rewarded for his work. He can also lead the comrades around him to study. Chen Yuzhen of the County People's Bank improved her political sense of responsibility for her work through study, made achievements in her work, and was rated as an active worker. Jin Yonglin of the Public Security Bureau mistakenly believed in the past that "the Party Committee can get things done, the administration promotes quickly, and the public security work can't get out after entering", therefore, his work enthusiasm was sometimes hot and sometimes cold. But after studying "State and Revolution" this time, he realized the importance of security work and felt that it was an honor to do public security work, so his work attitude changed. Although the workload has increased after the "Three-Anti" campaign, he does not complain and can work hard.

The CCP Haicheng County Committee has achieved certain results in leading cadres' political theory study. At present, in addition to continuing to adhere to cadres' political theory study, it is also necessary to pay attention to the cultural study of general cadres.

### 中共辽东省海城县委  加强对县级机关干部政治理论学习的领导

    中共辽东省海城县委
    加强对县级机关干部政治理论学习的领导
    据东北日报讯：中共辽东省海城县委重视县级机关在职干部的理论学习，配备与充实了领导学习的力量，健全了学习组织，使干部的政治理论学习走向经常化。该县正规的干部政治理论学习是在去年
    “三反”思想建设的基础上开展起来的。开始时，县委书记李汝舟同志即责成各机关党委加强对干部理论学习的领导，规定了任何人不准任意侵占学习时间等制度，自上而下地保证学习制度的贯彻。此后，县委经常关心干部的理论学习，并认真地研究和解决了一些有关领导与组织干部学习的问题，尽力解决了专职与兼职教员问题。目前，该县已配备了五名质量较高而有讲解能力的专职理论教员，今后还计划在可能的条件下再增加两名。不少的县委部长、委员除了本身坚持理论学习和担任中级组兼职教员外，还能在检查工作时经常了解和督促干部的理论学习。
    县委为了加强机关学校的各项组织工作，具体地掌握干部理论学习的进度，随时检查县直属机关各单位在学习中存在的问题，并为密切上下级的联系起见，特设两名专职干部，负责中级组、初级组第一班和第二班的理论学习，这不但解决了机关学校管理工作中的困难，而且加强了干部理论学习的指导力量。此外，县委还注意了对学习的辅导工作。在教员每讲授一章之前，党总支召集辅导员会议，研究课文的中心、重点，交流辅导工作的经验，研究学员的思想情况，研究如何帮助学员消化讲课的内容，提高他们的思想认识。县委除加强学习的组织领导外，还注意了实现思想领导，纠正学习的偏向，端正学习态度，帮助弄清学习中的问题。如在去年年底总结学习时，县委宣传部长针对学习当中的思想问题做了报告，澄清了一些不正确的认识，端正了学习态度。又如在过去讲授社会科学基本知识中关于阶级与阶级斗争的问题时，中共海城县委委员、海城县长高路滨同志就讲课人没有讲清楚的几个问题进行具体的指导。
    由于县委重视干部的政治理论学习，并加强了组织领导和思想领导，使参加学习的人有了基本政治理论认识，并且能够根据这些认识来联系自己的思想与工作，因而提高了觉悟程度和政治责任心。经过学习后，大家共同地认识到只有好好学习才能把工作做好，把思想觉悟提高。现在认为“学不学没啥”的人已经寥寥无几了，在学习中大家都能认真听讲，作笔记，在讨论会上积极发言。如县人民银行王永强过去不愿学习，认为学不学都一样，无论讨论或自学都抱着应付态度，后来由于党的不断教育，端正了学习态度，努力学习提高了觉悟，参加了青年团，工作上也得到了奖励。他并且能够带动周围的同志学习。县人民银行陈玉珍通过学习提高了工作的政治责任心，工作上有了成绩，被评为积极工作者。公安局金永林过去错误地认为“党委吃得开，行政提拔快，公安工作进去出不来”，因此，工作情绪忽冷忽热。但这次学习了“国家与革命”后，知道了保卫工作的重要性，感觉做公安工作是光荣的，所以工作态度转变了，“三反”后虽然工作担子重了，也不叫苦，能埋头苦干。
    中共海城县委在领导干部政治理论学习方面已取得了一定成绩，目前除了把干部政治理论学习继续坚持下去以外，尚需重视一般干部的文化学习。
