The construction preparation work at the Chongqing 507 Power Plant has many problems.

The domestic and foreign equipment for the plant's construction project has been under the exclusive responsibility of the Equipment Storage Section of the plant's engineering team since this year. However, most of the fourteen cadres in the Equipment Storage Section are unfamiliar with the work and have low education levels, making it impossible for them to complete their tasks. At the same time, because the overall packing lists for foreign orders have not been delivered in a timely manner, classification and storage are very difficult. For example, the boxes from the Soviet Union only have box numbers and no names of the equipment inside. We don't know what's inside, so we have to judge whether they contain turbine parts or boiler parts based on the box numbers. There's no way to determine if all the parts have arrived, and the specifications of the equipment inside the boxes are even more unknown. Those that require on-site processing cannot be decided upon. This situation will seriously affect the progress of the installation project.

In terms of material preparation, because the detailed construction drawings for the main plant building have not been fully received, the accurate numbers and detailed specifications of the required steel bars cannot be calculated. We have no choice but to order them according to approximate specifications, and waste is inevitable. At the same time, the scope of the foreign supply of equipment is still unclear, which also creates difficulties in the preparation of domestic equipment.

There are also many problems in construction management. The current project is being contracted by the Seventh Engineering Division of the Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau. Because the detailed construction drawings for the main plant building have not been fully received, a contract has not been signed, which has caused some difficulties in supervision and bank appropriations. Also, because the detailed construction drawings have not been fully received, the Seventh Engineering Division believes that the construction schedule plan drafted by the plant's engineering team and agreed upon by themselves is only of reference value and does not intend to follow it.

Because some preparatory work was not completed according to the prescribed procedures and dates, it has caused a lot of difficulties for construction. For example, the work of leveling the plant site was not completed as scheduled. Now that the coal bunker of the main plant building has begun to be poured with concrete, a large area of newly excavated rocks with sharp edges and corners still lies across the path from the formwork workshop and steel bar processing yard to the main plant building, making it impossible to lay tracks. We have to use flatcars to transport steel bars, formwork, and other building materials. Furthermore, the failure to complete the highway and railway directly leading to the plant building as scheduled has caused even more serious difficulties in transporting machinery and equipment and construction machinery. In addition, in the construction preparation work, the training of technical workers has been neglected. There are currently two concrete mixers on the construction site, but only one worker knows how to operate them; the steel bar cutting machine in the steel bar processing yard has not been installed, and no one knows how to use it, making construction mechanization an empty phrase.

The security work at the construction site is also very poor. Currently, the construction site is conducting democratic supplementary lessons on the one hand and adding sentry posts on the other. However, in terms of fire prevention, only some fire extinguishers and other equipment have been added, and the fire prevention organization has not yet been established.

### 重庆五零七电厂施工准备工作问题很多

    重庆五零七电厂施工准备工作问题很多
    重庆五零七电厂的施工准备工作存在着很多问题。
    该厂建设工程的国内外设备，从今年起已由该厂工程队设备保管科专责保管。但设备保管科十四名干部，大部不熟悉业务、文化水平低，不能完成任务。同时因为国外定货的总装箱单没有及时送到，分类保管很困难。如苏联来的箱子只有箱号，没有箱内设备名字，不知道里面装的是什么东西，只好按箱号来判断里面装的是透平机件还是锅炉机件。对机件来齐没有也无从判断，箱子里的设备规格更无从知道，那些需要现场加工也不能决定。这种情况，将严重影响安装工程的进行。
    在材料准备方面，由于主厂房施工详图没有到齐，所需钢筋的准确数字和详细规格就计算不出来，不得不根据近似的规格去订购，浪费自然不能免。同时对于国外供应器材的范围到现在也还不清楚，也造成国内准备器材的困难。
    施工管理方面存在的问题也很多。现在正在进行的工程，是由西南建筑工程局第七工程处承包的。由于主厂房施工详图没有到齐，承包合同就没有订立，使得监督上和银行拨款上都发生了一些困难。又由于施工详图没有到齐，第七工程处对该厂工程队拟定而又经自己同意的施工进度计划，认为只有参考价值，也不打算照着做。
    由于有些准备工作没有按照规定程序和日期完成，给施工造成了不少困难。如平厂基工作没有如期完成，现在主厂房煤仓已开始浇灌混凝土，但从模板工场和钢筋作业场到主厂房的通路上还横亘着一大片新开出来的、有锋利棱角的大小岩石，弄得没法铺设轨道，只得用平车来推运钢筋、模板等建筑材料。至于直通厂房的公路和铁路不能如期完成，给搬运机器设备和施工机械造成的困难更是严重。另外，在施工准备工作中，还忽视了技术工人的训练。工地上现有两部混凝土捣拌机，只有一个工人会开；钢筋作业场切钢筋的机器，没有装也没有人会使，施工机械化成了一句空话。
    工地的保卫工作也很差。现在工地一方面在进行民主补课，一方面在增添岗哨。但在防火方面只添置了一些灭火器一类的设备，还没有把防火组织建。
