China People's Insurance Company Staff Should Correct the Mistake of Forcing Farmers to Insure Livestock

The branches of the People's Insurance Company of China have achieved considerable success in carrying out livestock insurance work in rural areas over the past two years. However, the phenomenon of coercion and commandism in carrying out business is very serious.

Livestock insurance business began on a trial basis in May 1950. By the end of 1952, 12 million head of livestock were insured nationwide. Many insurance companies and farmers have signed covenants to love and protect livestock, improving livestock breeding and management, thereby reducing livestock mortality. About 400,000 heads of livestock insured by farmers have been compensated after death, ensuring the continuity of agricultural production. In the livestock insurance business, the branches of the People's Insurance Company of China have suffered from a serious style of coercion and commandism because of the prevalence of a purely task-oriented view. Some insurance company cadres used methods such as "exhausting meetings, no dispersal without insurance," and even sent militia to surround the venue, forcing farmers to insure. Some cadres even threatened farmers, saying, "Not insuring is not patriotic," "Not insuring is counter-revolutionary," and "Not insuring will send you to court." After farmers in some disaster-stricken areas of Huangyuan County, Qinghai, were forced to insure their livestock, they had to hand over the government's relief grain as insurance premiums. Some insurance company cadres also used deceptive means to induce farmers to insure. Li Guohua, a special agent of Yongjia County, Zhejiang, said to village cadres, "If you take the lead in insuring at the mass meeting, and everyone insures, we will refund your premium." Some insurance company cadres in Liaoxi Province even enticed village cadres, saying, "If the village cadres do a good job in insurance work, the company will issue salaries this year."

After some insurance company cadres forced farmers to participate in livestock insurance, they used coercive methods to collect insurance premiums. Liang Chunren, a cadre of the Yushu County Insurance Branch in Jilin, said rudely to farmers when collecting fees, "You have to pay even if you break pots and sell your wives; you have to pay." Huo Huating, a farmer in the fourth administrative village of Ledu County, Qinghai, was imprisoned because he did not have money to pay the insurance premium. Some farmers even paid insurance premiums with the seed money borrowed from the bank.

This coercive and commandist approach and the purely task-oriented approach of cadres in insurance companies in various places has forced many farmers who were unwilling to participate in livestock insurance to take out insurance. As a result, farmers have serious arrears, insurance companies have paid a lot of compensation, and the underwriting business is very unconsolidated. In 1952, the arrears of livestock insured by insurance companies at all levels in North China reached a maximum of 16 billion yuan. In the Northwest Region, from January 1951 to August 1952, arrears in livestock insurance business accounted for more than one-third of the insurance premiums receivable. In 1952, the compensation paid for livestock insurance in Qinghai Province accounted for more than 80% of insurance premium income. The phenomenon of arrears in the Central and Southern Region is also very common and serious, with compensation accounting for more than 50% of income in various places, and compensation even exceeding income in individual areas. In the second district of Suining County, Sichuan, 940 heads of livestock were insured in 1951, and only 87 heads were renewed upon expiration. In some counties in the Handan area of ​​Hebei, insurance companies previously forced farmers to take out collective insurance, and farmers collectively withdrew their insurance when collecting fees.

The occurrence and growth of this coercive and illegal behavior of cadres of local People's Insurance Companies is inseparable from the serious bureaucratic work style of leading cadres of insurance companies at all levels. First of all, the leading cadres of the head office of the People's Insurance Company of China blindly emphasized the number of livestock insured, regardless of the subjective and objective conditions of various places, and prematurely put forward the policy of vigorously developing livestock insurance business; after arranging work, they rarely explained policies and specific practices. Their inspection work was also not thorough enough, so that they could not discover and correct errors and deviations in their work in time. The company revised the issued instructions several times, but did not explain the reasons for the revisions, making the cadres below at a loss. Under the domination of this leadership thinking and leadership methods, it fueled the purely task-oriented view of lower-level cadres, forming a phenomenon of task allocation at each level, only pursuing the number of insured, regardless of the work effect. For example, in order to pursue the number of tasks, the Hebei Provincial Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China adjusted the tasks five times in 1951, increasing the initial task of insuring 8,000 heads of livestock to 260,000 heads. The Ji'yuan Special Agency of the former Pingyuan Provincial Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China had only one cadre, but the superior company assigned him the task of insuring 24,000 heads of livestock in 1952. The task assigned by the Qinghai Provincial Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China to the Huangzhong Branch not only exceeded the actual number of livestock in the area, but also told the cadres, "You are not allowed to return until the task is completed."

At present, the local branches of the People's Insurance Company of China are carrying out a struggle against bureaucracy, against coercion and commandism, and against violations of law and discipline. These issues should be thoroughly examined and seriously dealt with to prevent such incidents from continuing to occur. (Du Zijie)

    中国人民保险公司工作人员
    应该纠正强迫农民投保牲畜的错误行为
    中国人民保险公司所属分支公司在农村中举办牲畜保险工作，两年来获得相当成绩。但在开展业务中的强迫命令现象十分严重。
    牲畜保险业务从一九五○年五月开始试办，到一九五二年年底，全国承保牲畜有一千二百万头。许多保险公司和农民订立了爱畜护畜公约，改进了牲畜的饲养管理，因而减少了牲畜的死亡。农民投保的牲畜，约有四十万头在死亡后得到补偿，保障了农业生产的持续。中国人民保险公司所属分支公司在牲畜保险业务中，由于单纯任务观点相当普遍，发生了严重的强迫命令作风。有些保险公司干部采用“疲劳开会、不保不散”的办法，甚至派民兵包围会场，强迫农民投保。有些干部更威胁农民说：“不保险就是不爱国”，“不保险就是反革命”，“不保险就送法院”。青海湟源县部分受灾地区农民的牲畜被迫投保后，只得把政府发的救济粮交了保险费。有的保险公司干部还采用欺骗手段，诱迫农民投保。浙江永嘉县特约代理处干部李国华对村干部说：“你在群众大会上带头投保，大家保了，就给你退保。”辽西省有的保险公司干部竟利诱村干部说：“如果村干部把保险工作作好了，今年公司要发给工薪。”
    有些保险公司的干部强迫农民参加牲畜保险后，就以强迫命令的方法收取保险费。吉林榆树县保险支公司干部梁纯仁在收费时蛮横地对农民说：“砸锅卖铁，卖老婆也得给钱，不给不行。”青海乐都县四行政村农民霍华庭没有钱交保险费，竟被关了禁闭。有的农民甚至将银行贷的种籽款交了保险费。
    各地保险公司干部的这种强迫命令和单纯追求任务的作法，使得许多不愿参加牲畜保险的农民也被迫投了保，结果农民欠费严重，保险公司赔款很多，承保业务很不巩固。一九五二年华北区各级保险公司所承保的牲畜，欠费最多时达一百六十亿元。西北区从一九五一年一月到一九五二年八月，在承保牲畜业务中欠费竟占应收保险费的三分之一以上。青海省一九五二年因牲畜保险所赔的款，要占保险费收入的百分之八十以上。中南区欠费现象也很普遍和严重，各地赔款占收入的百分之五十以上，个别地区赔款甚至超过收入。四川遂宁县第二区一九五一年承保了九百四十头牲畜，到期续保的只八十七头。河北邯郸专区有些县的保险公司，过去强迫农民集体投保，在收费时农民就都集体退了保。
    各地人民保险公司干部的这种强迫命令和违法乱纪行为的发生与滋长，是和各级保险公司领导干部的严重官僚主义作风分不开的。首先是中国人民保险公司总公司的领导干部，他们盲目强调牲畜承保数字，不顾各地主观和客观条件，过早地提出了大力开展牲畜保险业务的方针；而在布置工作以后，又很少交代政策和具体做法。他们检查工作也很不深入，以致不能及时发现和纠正工作中的错误与偏差。该公司在对所发指示修改数次，也不讲明修改的道理，使得下面的干部无所适从。在这种领导思想和领导方法的支配下，就助长了下级干部的单纯任务观点，形成层层分摊任务，光追求承保数字，而不计工作效果的现象。例如中国人民保险公司河北省分公司为追求任务数字，在一九五一年中曾连续调整任务五次之多，从最初保险八千头牲畜的任务增加到二十六万头。前中国人民保险公司平原省分公司济源特约代理处只有干部一人，而上级公司却在一九五二年分配了他保险二万四千头牲畜的任务。中国人民保险公司青海省分公司所分配湟中支公司的任务，不但超过当地实际所有牲畜数，并对干部说：“完不成任务不准回来”。
    目前中国人民保险公司所属各地分支公司正在开展反对官僚主义、反对强迫命令、反对违法乱纪的斗争，对这些问题应作深刻检查，并作严肃处理，以杜绝这类事件继续发生。　（杜子杰）
