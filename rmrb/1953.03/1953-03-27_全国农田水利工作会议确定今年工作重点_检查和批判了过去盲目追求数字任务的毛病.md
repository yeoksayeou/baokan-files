Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: To implement the State Council's directive on continuing to carry out mass drought prevention and resistance movements in 1953, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government convened a National Farmland Water Conservancy Conference from March 6th to 17th. The conference determined that this year's farmland water conservancy work should focus on mass drought and flood prevention, expanding irrigated areas, strengthening irrigation management, and economical water use, to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture nationwide through water conservancy efforts.

The conference implemented the spirit of anti-bureaucracy. Cadres from the Ministry of Water Resources down to the provincial water conservancy bureaus and canal management offices all reviewed and criticized past mistakes of not being oriented towards production or the masses of farmers, but blindly pursuing numerical targets, disregarding project quality, and neglecting project benefits. Fu Zuoyi, Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, said in his opening speech: The purpose of developing irrigation is to increase yield per unit area, but the cotton production in the Jinghui Canal area of Shaanxi Province has been declining year by year, which is like a warning bell ringing for all of our farmland water conservancy workers. Zhang Zilin, Director of the Central Irrigation Bureau, said in his review report: How many of the ponds, dams, wells, and canals built in the past can actually play a role, how much actual increase in production has been achieved, which areas are already guaranteed against drought, and to what extent can which areas resist drought – we have a very poor understanding of these issues; and because of our bureaucracy, forced commands have occurred at lower levels. Cadres from various provinces attending the meeting also reviewed their past work. Cadres from Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and other places reviewed the phenomenon of district and township cadres forcing farmers to form teams and classes to dig wells due to the provincial and prefectural leading organs blindly increasing tasks at each level and simply pursuing numerical targets. Leading cadres in various regions also reviewed the ideological problem of being overly ambitious and greedy in projects, resulting in neglecting some aspects for others, preventing many water conservancy projects from发挥发挥 their due effectiveness. The conference also criticized the fact that many large-scale irrigation projects lacked thorough planning and neglected irrigation management.

The conference believes that future farmland water conservancy work must emphasize starting from the urgent needs of farmers and adhere to the principle of adapting to local conditions, and can only be carried out when farmers have labor, financial resources, and willingness to participate. Cadres at all levels must pay attention to the basic principles of need and possibility when leading this work, and also take into account the technical conditions of farmers. Whether constructing water conservancy projects, rectifying existing projects, or implementing scientific water use and expanding irrigated areas, we must do so on the basis of farmers' voluntary participation and must not stipulate "rigid tasks." Only in this way can we correct the problems of forced commands, violations of law and discipline, and turning good things into bad things in farmland water conservancy work. The conference also pointed out that this does not mean that leadership over farmland water conservancy work can be relaxed from now on. The small-scale projects built in various places, as long as they truly arise from the farmers' active demands, should be boldly led to ensure a bumper harvest of agricultural products this year.

The conference finally pointed out that spring plowing has already begun, and the precipitation in North China, Northeast China, and other places is less than in previous years; it is predicted that rainfall in the south may also be lacking during the summer and autumn. Therefore, all localities must mobilize farmers to do a good job in farmland water conservancy work in accordance with the State Council's directive on continuing to carry out mass drought prevention and resistance movements in 1953. The idea that cadres can ignore this work because it is done by the masses themselves is wrong. Drought prevention work in various places should not be slackened or paralyzed.

    全国农田水利工作会议确定今年工作重点
    检查和批判了过去盲目追求数字任务的毛病
    【新华社二十六日讯】为了贯彻政务院关于一九五三年继续开展群众性防旱抗旱运动的指示，中央人民政府水利部在三月六日到十七日召开了全国农田水利工作会议。会议确定：今年的农田水利工作，要以群众性的防旱防涝、扩大灌溉面积、加强灌溉管理经济用水为重点，从水利上来保证今年全国的农业丰收。
    会议贯彻了反官僚主义的精神，从中央水利部到各省水利局和渠道管理的干部，都检查和批判了过去不面向生产、不面向农民群众而发生盲目追求数字任务、不问工程质量、不计工程效益的毛病。中央人民政府水利部部长傅作义在开幕词中说：我们发展灌溉事业的目的，是为了增加单位面积产量，而陕西省泾惠渠的棉花，却在逐年减产，这就等于对我们全体农田水利工作人员敲起了警钟。中央灌溉总局局长张子林在检查报告中说：过去所修的塘坝、水井、渠道究竟能起作用的有多少，实际增产了多少，那一区域已经有了防旱保证，那一区域又能抗旱到什么程度，我们是了解得很差的；并且由于我们存在有官僚主义，致使下边发生了强迫命令的事情。到会的各省干部也对过去的工作作了检查。山东、河北、河南等地干部检查了由于省和专区的领导机关盲目地逐级加大任务，单纯追求数字，而发生了有些区、乡干部把农民编队、编班打井的强迫命令现象。各地领导干部也检查了在工程中好大贪多的思想毛病，结果顾此失彼，使多数水利工程未能发挥应有效用。会议对大型灌溉工程，很多规划不够确实，不注意灌溉管理，也作了批判。
    会议认为：今后的农田水利工作，必须强调从农民的迫切需要出发，并本因地制宜的原则，在农民有劳力、财力和自愿从事的情况下，才能进行。各级干部在领导这一工作中，必须注意需要与可能的基本原则，同时照顾到农民的技术条件。各地无论在修建水利工程中，或是在整顿现有工程中，以及实行科学用水、扩大灌溉面积时，都必须在农民自愿的基础上来做，不能规定“死任务”。只有这样，才能纠正农田水利工作中的强迫命令、违法乱纪、把好事办坏的毛病。会议同时指出：这样作并不是从此就可放松对农田水利工作的领导。各地兴修的小型工程，只要真正是出于农民的积极要求，就应该大胆放手地去领导，以保证今年农产品的丰收。
    会议最后指出：目前春耕生产已经开始，而华北、东北等地的降水量都比往年为少；据预测南方在夏、秋期间，雨量也可能缺少。为此，各地必须根据中央人民政府政务院关于一九五三年继续开展群众性防旱抗旱运动的指示，动员农民做好农田水利工作。认为这一工作由群众自办，干部就可以不管的思想是错误的。各地的防旱工作，不应松懈麻痹。
