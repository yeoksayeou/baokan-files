    Resolutely Oppose the Illegal Resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on the Korean Question

    The Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, after a two-month recess, reconvened on February 24. The first item on the agenda after the resumption was to continue the discussion on the Korean question. The discussion of this issue in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded on the 7th of this month. The previous illegal resolution on the Korean question, passed under the manipulation of the United States, remains unchanged. Clearly, because the United Nations General Assembly succumbed to the violent will of the American aggressors, the Korean question has not yet been resolved reasonably.

    Stopping the Korean War is one of the most pressing issues for easing current international tensions and safeguarding world peace. All peace-loving people around the world demand an immediate end to this bloody war provoked by the American aggressors. At the first half of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet delegation submitted a proposal to the Assembly that conformed to the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world. It advocated that the belligerent parties in the Korean War should immediately implement a comprehensive ceasefire in Korea in accordance with the draft armistice agreement that both sides had already agreed upon, and that the issue of the complete repatriation of prisoners of war should be handed over to the committee for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question as stipulated in the Soviet proposal. The Soviet delegation's proposal was obviously the only fair, reasonable, and practical solution. However, the United States delegation, manipulating the "majority" of the United Nations General Assembly, brazenly rejected this fair and reasonable proposal. Under the direct pressure of the United States, the United Nations General Assembly passed an illegal resolution on the Korean question that was essentially a disguised version of the so-called "Twenty-One Nation Proposal" of the United States. This notorious illegal resolution not only failed to put forward any specific suggestions for a ceasefire in Korea, but also openly supported the American government's criminal stance of forcibly detaining prisoners of war in violation of international law. Regarding this fact, even official spokespersons of the United States and its satellite states have repeatedly and publicly acknowledged and boasted that this illegal resolution "powerfully and resolutely established the principle of voluntary repatriation."

    This illegal resolution attempts to portray the American aggressors' scheme to forcibly detain prisoners of war as if it respects the "individual will" of the prisoners of war and conforms to the humanitarian spirit of the Geneva Conventions. Such blatant and shameless nonsense has no basis whatsoever. People know that the so-called "unwillingness to be repatriated" "desire" of the American aggressors' prisoners of war was created by extremely barbarous and cruel means. The bloody facts in American prisoner-of-war camps are that the American aggressors used a large number of special agents to conduct illegal "screenings" of prisoners of war. Many of our captured personnel sacrificed their lives because of their resolute resistance to this American atrocity. During the first phase of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, from October 14 to December 4 last year, according to statistics based solely on news disclosed by American and British news agencies, as many as 321 of our captured personnel were beaten to death or injured. Since the United Nations General Assembly passed this illegal resolution, that is, from December 4 last year to February 24 this year, the day the United Nations General Assembly reconvened, another 286 of our captured personnel in prisoner-of-war camps in Koje Island and other places were beaten to death or injured by the American aggressors. In the short eight days from February 28 to the time the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly announced the end of the discussion on the Korean question, that is, until March 7, the American aggressors successively beat to death or injured 85 of our captured personnel in prisoner-of-war camps in Geoje Island, Koje Island, Yongcho Island, and Jeju Island, including the bloody massacre in the Yongcho Island prisoner-of-war camp on March 7, which killed or injured 65 of our captured personnel in one fell swoop. These many bloody facts that have occurred in American prisoner-of-war camps declare the complete bankruptcy of the American lie of so-called "prisoners of war refusing repatriation."

    What is even more intolerable is that the illegal resolution on the Korean question passed by the United Nations General Assembly encourages the American aggressors to continue their unbridled ambition to wage and expand the war of aggression. On the very day that the United Nations General Assembly passed this illegal resolution under the manipulation of the United States, Eisenhower, accompanied by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley and his newly appointed Secretary of Defense Wilson, went to Korea to actively plot ways to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea. After returning to the United States, Eisenhower made no secret of his intention to abandon the armistice negotiations and pursue military adventures. In his State of the Union Address to the United States Congress on February 2, Eisenhower even blatantly announced that he would "resolve the Korean War by military means," and declared that he would expand American aggression to Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaya. In the two months since the United Nations General Assembly passed this illegal resolution, the American aggressors have continued to massacre prisoners of war on a large scale in Korea, continued to wage germ warfare, and indiscriminately bombed peaceful residents and peaceful facilities in the rear of Korea, unilaterally tearing up the agreement on not attacking supply vehicles of negotiating delegations, and constantly harassed the Panmunjom neutral zone, attempting to completely undermine the Korean armistice negotiations. At the same time, they have increasingly frequently violated our country's airspace with their air force invading Korea, and even dispatched special agent planes to our country's airspace to carry out criminal strategic reconnaissance, dropped special agents, attempting to organize sabotage activities within our country, and directed and assisted the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan in attempting to disrupt our coast, in order to facilitate its actions to expand the war of aggression. On the other hand, the American aggressors are stepping up the arming of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, replacing Van Fleet, the commander of the Eighth Army of the American forces invading Korea, and dispatching Army Chief of Staff Collins to Korea, actively preparing to take new military adventures, attempting to save the defeat of the aggression against Korea; under the direction of the United States, new collusion is taking place between the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, the Japanese Yoshida government, the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan, and the Quirino government of the Philippines, stepping up the action to interfere in Vietnam, and actively plotting the so-called conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians"; at the same time, the United States is also putting pressure on Britain, forcing Britain to participate in its so-called "blockade" against our country. These increasingly blatant actions of the American aggressors to expand the war of aggression are in fact carried out under the direct encouragement of the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly.

    After the United Nations General Assembly reconvened, the American aggressors immediately brought out this illegal resolution, attempting to use it to shirk their responsibility for undermining the Korean armistice negotiations and expanding the war of aggression. The American representative Lodge, on the second day after the reconvening, even reversed the truth and slandered the Soviet Union for wanting to "continue this war," and shamelessly said that the American aggression in the Far East was "to establish peace." However, the people of Asia and the world can see very clearly that it is not the Soviet Union that is armedly invading Korea and threatening China's security, but the American aggressors. Millions of peaceful residents in Korea have been killed by the American aggressors' napalm bombs and germ bombs. The Soviet Union was the first to advocate stopping the Korean War, and the Korean armistice negotiations were proposed by the Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik in June 1951. At the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union made great efforts to strive for the realization of peace in Korea. At the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet delegation headed by Vyshinsky stood from the beginning on the position of seeking a peaceful settlement of the Korean question, and repeatedly proposed the immediate comprehensive ceasefire and the establishment of a committee for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question to resolve the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation in the Korean armistice and related suggestions for the peaceful reunification of Korea; the head of the Soviet delegation Vyshinsky reiterated on March 2, after the resumption on February 24, the proposal to peacefully end the Korean War, which is even more sufficient to prove the Soviet Union's sincerity in meeting the Korean armistice aspirations of peace-loving people around the world. It is well known that the United States, at the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, like it did at the Sixth Session, stubbornly refused to stop the Korean War. Therefore, the American aggressors' attempt to use the illegal resolution of the United Nations General Assembly to slander the Soviet Union's efforts to seek peace in Korea and shirk its own guilt for continuing and expanding the war of aggression cannot deceive anyone.

    The Chinese people believe that the resolution on the Korean question passed by the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly is illegal and therefore invalid. If the United Nations General Assembly still intends to resolve the Korean question by peaceful means, it should take effective measures to stop the American aggressors' conspiracy to continue and expand the war, solemnly demand that the United States immediately and unconditionally resume the Korean armistice negotiations, and in accordance with the proposals for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question put forward by the Soviet delegation on November 10 and November 24 last year, first realize a complete ceasefire between the belligerent parties in accordance with the draft Korean armistice agreement that has already been agreed upon by both sides, and hand over the issue of complete prisoner repatriation together with the peaceful settlement of the Korean question to the Committee for the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question composed of the eleven countries proposed by the Soviet Union for resolution. If the United Nations General Assembly continues to succumb to the violent will of the American aggressors, insisting on its illegal resolution aimed at supporting the American government's violation of international conventions and forced detention of prisoners of war, encouraging the American aggressors to continue and expand the war of aggression, then the Chinese people's determination is only to fight together with the Korean people until the US imperialism is willing to stop, until the Chinese and Korean people achieve complete victory.

### 坚决反对联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的非法决议

    坚决反对联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的非法决议
    第七届联合国大会经过两个月的休会，已于二月二十四日复会。复会后的第一项议程，是继续讨论朝鲜问题。而这一项问题在联合国大会政治委员会中的讨论，也已于本月七日结束。前此，在美国操纵下所通过的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议，依然如故。显然的，由于联合国大会屈服于美国侵略者的强暴意旨，使朝鲜问题目前仍然得不到合理的解决。
    停止朝鲜战争，是缓和目前国际紧张局势、保卫世界和平的最迫切的问题之一。全世界一切爱好和平的人民，都要求立即制止美国侵略者所挑起的这个血腥战争。在第七届联合国大会的前半期会议上，苏联代表团曾向大会提出符合世界人民这种和平愿望的建议。主张由朝鲜战争的交战双方，按照双方已经同意的停战协定草案，在朝鲜立即实行全面停战，而把战俘全部遣返的问题交给苏联提案中所规定的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会去解决。苏联代表团的这个提案，显然是唯一公平合理而切实可行的办法。可是，美国代表团操纵联合国大会的“多数”，悍然拒绝了这个公平合理的建议。在美国的直接压力下，联合国大会通过了实际上是美国的所谓“二十一国提案”改装的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议。这个臭名昭著的非法决议，不仅没有提出任何在朝鲜停战的具体建议，而且公然支持美国政府违反国际公法，强迫扣留战俘的罪恶立场。对于这一事实，就是美国及其仆从国家的官方发言人也曾多次公开承认，并吹嘘这个非法决议为“有力地、坚决地确定了自愿遣返的原则”。
    这个非法决议企图把美国侵略者强迫扣留战俘的图谋，说成似乎是尊重战俘的“个人意志”并符合日内瓦公约的人道主义精神，这种公然无耻的胡说是没有任何根据的。人们都知道，美国侵略者所谓“战俘拒绝遣返”的“意愿”，是用极端野蛮残暴的办法制造出来的。美国战俘营里的血腥事实是，美国侵略者使用大批特务对战俘进行非法的“甄别”。我方被俘人员由于坚决抗拒美国的这种暴行，以致牺牲了许多性命。就在去年十月十四日到十二月四日第七届联合国大会第一阶段开会期间，仅据美英通讯社所透露出来的消息加以统计，这样被打死打伤的我方被俘人员便有三百二十一人之多。而在联合国大会通过这个非法决议以来，即从去年十二月四日到今年二月二十四日联合国大会复会的那天止，蜂岩岛等地战俘营里的我方被俘人员又被美国侵略者打死打伤了二百八十六人。而从二月二十八日到联合国大会政治委员会宣布结束朝鲜问题讨论的时候，即到三月七日为止的短短八天中，美国侵略者又接连地在巨济岛、蜂岩岛、龙草岛和济州岛等战俘营中打死打伤我方被俘人员八十五人，其中包括三月七日在龙草岛战俘营的血腥大屠杀，一次打死打伤我方被俘人员六十五人。美方战俘营里所发生的这许多血淋淋的事实，宣告了美方所谓
    “战俘拒绝遣返”谎言的彻底破产。
    更加令人不能容忍的，是联合国大会所通过的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议，鼓励了美国侵略者继续肆无忌惮地进行和扩大侵略战争的野心。就在联合国大会在美国操纵下通过这个非法决议的那天，艾森豪威尔带着美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷和他的新任国防部长威尔逊到了朝鲜，积极策划继续和扩大侵朝战争的办法。艾森豪威尔在回到美国之后，就毫不掩饰他要放弃停战谈判，追求军事冒险。二月二日，艾森豪威尔向美国国会提出的国情咨文中，更明目张胆地宣布“要用军事办法解决朝鲜战争”，并且声言要把美国的侵略活动扩大到台湾、越南和马来亚去。联合国大会这个非法决议通过后的两个月中，美国侵略者一方面在朝鲜继续大规模屠杀战俘，继续进行细菌战，狂轰滥炸朝鲜后方和平居民与和平设施，片面撕毁关于不袭击谈判代表团供应车辆的协议，不断袭扰板门店中立区，企图把朝鲜停战谈判彻底破坏；同时，日益频繁地以其侵朝空军侵犯我国领空，甚至派遣特务飞机到我国上空进行罪恶的战略侦察，降下特务分子，企图在我国内部组织破坏活动，并指使和协助台湾国民党残余匪帮企图对我沿海进行扰乱，以便利它扩大侵略战争的行动。另一方面，美国侵略者正加紧武装李承晚伪军，撤换了侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特，并派遣陆军参谋长柯林斯到朝鲜，积极准备采取新的军事冒险行动，企图挽救侵略朝鲜的败局；在美国导演下，李承晚匪帮、日本吉田政府、台湾国民党残余匪帮和菲律宾季里诺政府之间进行着新的勾结，加紧了干涉越南的行动，积极策动所谓“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋；同时，美国也正在加压力于英国，迫使英国参加它对我国实行的所谓“封锁”。美国侵略者这些越来越明目张胆扩大侵略战争的行动，事实证明是在联合国大会所通过的非法决议直接鼓励之下进行的。
    联合国大会复会后，美国侵略者立刻搬出了这个非法决议，企图利用它来推脱其破坏朝鲜停战谈判、扩大侵略战争的责任。美国代表洛奇在复会后的第二天，竟颠倒事实真象，诽谤苏联要“继续这个战争”，并恬不知耻地说美国在远东的侵略罪行是“为了建立和平”。但是，亚洲和全世界人民都看得很清楚，武装侵略朝鲜、威胁中国安全的不是苏联，而是美国侵略者。朝鲜的千百万和平居民是被美国侵略者的凝固汽油弹和细菌弹杀害的。苏联是最先主张停止朝鲜战争的，朝鲜停战谈判就是苏联驻联合国代表马立克在一九五一年六月提议召开的。在第六届联合国大会上，苏联为争取朝鲜和平的实现作了重大的努力。在第七届联合国大会上，以维辛斯基为首的苏联代表团一开始就站在谋求朝鲜问题和平解决的立场，一再提出了立即全面停战并设立和平解决朝鲜问题委员会来解决朝鲜停战中的战俘遣返问题以及有关朝鲜和平统一的建议；二月二十四日复会后，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基于三月二日重申和平结束朝鲜战争的建议，更足以证明苏联为满足全世界爱好和平人民渴求朝鲜停战热望的真诚。人所共知，美国在第七届联合国大会上，像它在第六届大会上一样，是顽固地拒绝停止朝鲜战争的。因此，美国侵略者企图利用联合国大会的非法决议来诬蔑苏联谋求朝鲜和平的努力，推脱它自己继续和扩大侵略战争罪责的诡计，是欺骗不了任何人的。
    中国人民认为，第七届联合国大会所通过的关于朝鲜问题决议是非法的，因而也是无效的。如果联合国大会还有意于用和平方法解决朝鲜问题，就应该采取有效办法制止美国侵略者继续和扩大战争的阴谋，严正地要求美国立即无条件恢复朝鲜停战谈判，并根据苏联代表团去年十一月十日和十一月二十四日所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，首先按照双方业已获得协议的朝鲜停战协定草案，实现交战双方的完全停火，而把战俘全部遣返问题与和平解决朝鲜问题一齐交给苏联所建议的十一国所组成的和平解决朝鲜问题委员会去解决。如果联合国大会仍然屈从于美国侵略者的强暴意旨，坚持其旨在支持美国政府违反国际公约，强迫扣留战俘的非法决议，鼓励美国侵略者继续和扩大侵略战争，那末，中国人民的决心就只有同朝鲜人民一起，一直战斗下去，一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利的时候为止。
