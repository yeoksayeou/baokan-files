    Emphasize Equipment Supply Work
    -- Abstract of the Fourth Issue Editorial of "Heavy Industry Communications"

    The construction of a factory or mine must go through processes such as surveying, design, construction, installation, and trial operation. Currently, strengthening resource exploration work and expanding design and construction forces have begun to attract the attention of various capital construction units, and there have been preliminary changes. However, another important task to complete this year’s capital construction plan—equipment supply work—has not received sufficient attention from various bureaus, companies, and capital construction units. This is because these leading comrades have not recognized the nature of equipment supply work and its current position in capital construction work.

    First of all, these leading comrades do not deeply understand that capital construction ultimately aims to establish modern factories and mines with huge production capacity, not just to build houses. Any factory or mine, if it is not equipped with machines and production tools, cannot produce any products. Practice has repeatedly proved the decisive impact of equipment supply work on the completion of capital construction plans. For example, in 1952, the construction plan of a blast furnace in a certain steel company was delayed by three months simply because a gas burner failed to arrive on time. Therefore, all our capital construction units must not only master civil engineering and its balance, but also master the balance of equipment needs and their sources; not only know how many square meters of houses to build, but also be familiar with how many machines and how many tons of machines to install.

    Secondly, these leading comrades do not pay attention to equipment supply work because they do not deeply realize that the country's large-scale construction has already begun, and we are building some important factories and mines that are decisive for national industrialization. The equipment required by these newly built or renovated enterprises is complete sets of equipment that are complex in quantity, varied in type, and strict in technical specifications. Only with these technical equipment can these enterprises be truly built. Therefore, today’s equipment supply work is fundamentally different from the situation in the recovery period when only some sporadic supplements were needed. Therefore, we must change the old concept of confusing equipment with building materials, otherwise it will inevitably reduce the status of equipment supply work. All capital construction units must manage equipment supply work as a major task. Being familiar only with bricks, tiles, sand, stones, steel bars, wood, and cement, but not familiar with thousands of complex equipment, is not suitable for the current requirements of capital construction.

    Again, these leading comrades do not pay attention to equipment supply work because they do not deeply analyze the composition of each investment plan, and they do not deeply know the proportion of equipment in the investment. Judging from the 1953 annual plan, equipment accounts for nearly 40 percent of the total investment for the year; judging from the long-term plan, equipment accounts for 45 percent of the total investment. If there are serious shortcomings in our work in this area, then undoubtedly, the capital construction plan is fundamentally impossible to complete. Taking this year’s geological exploration tasks in the Ministry of Heavy Industry’s capital construction work as an example, more than 6,000 pieces of more than a dozen types of equipment are required (such as air compressors, forging machines, rock drills, winches, local fans, air blowers, water pumps, deep well water pumps, mine cars, etc.), but so far, only one-sixth of the required quantity has been initially resolved. If we do not make our best efforts to solve it, then this year’s exploration tasks will either be forced to be reduced or will not be able to complete the plan. Therefore, the practice of regarding equipment supply work as only a trivial matter, and not attaching importance to it from the leadership and strengthening the organization work in this area, will inevitably lead to the failure to complete the capital construction plan.

    Again, these leading comrades do not pay attention to equipment supply work because they do not deeply understand that there are still some inconsistencies between the quantity and variety of equipment we need and the currently possible sources. They still retain the old concept of the recovery period, thinking that only some machinery and equipment need to be supplemented in the construction, and these machinery and equipment can be processed and ordered by randomly finding a machine factory. However, it is not known that in the entire country's construction process, various major industries must develop in coordination with each other, and we cannot and should not require the machine manufacturing industry to supply us with various equipment that we arbitrarily propose at any time. If we do not simplify the specifications of the required equipment as much as possible, it will reduce the production capacity of machine-made industrial products due to the excessive complexity of specifications and varieties, which is not only related to the development of the machine manufacturing industry, but will actually affect the development of the entire industry. Therefore, on the one hand, we are required to formulate plans accurately based on the possibilities (we must not propose too much in quantity and too complicated in variety); on the other hand, we must strengthen the organization and management of domestic and foreign equipment ordering work under the unified national plan. If we have any slack phenomenon in this regard, it will bring irreparable losses to capital construction. Therefore, in order to fundamentally improve the current equipment supply work, all bureaus, companies, and capital construction units should first change their understanding. In the management of capital construction, the equipment supply work should be raised to an important position.

    In order to improve equipment supply and management, the following specific tasks should be carried out:

    First, do a good job in equipment supply planning. In order to do a good job in equipment planning, the following is required: (1) For the equipment required for important projects, orders must be placed only after preliminary design. Because only after design can the required quantity be calculated carefully and technical specifications be made. For engineering projects that do not go through strict design procedures, such as geological drilling and construction machinery, the required quantity of equipment must also be proposed after accurately calculating the technical quota of the equipment. Blindness in equipment planning work must be opposed. For example, in order to complete this year’s mineral exploration task, the Dongchuan Copper Mine proposed 12 200-horsepower air compressors in the plan, but according to the calculation of the technical capacity of the equipment, six units are enough. If such inaccurate plans are proposed, it will inevitably waste a lot of national funds. Therefore, to do a good job in equipment needs planning, we must first rely on careful design work and master the technical quota of equipment. (2) Equipment supply must be adapted to the engineering plan. For any engineering project, a progress plan for equipment needs must be made. When formulating the progress plan for equipment needs, the manufacturing time of the equipment should be fully estimated, and when formulating the engineering plan, the possibility of equipment supply should be accurately calculated. However, the practice of putting the annual equipment needs into the first quarter equipment balance plan must also be opposed, because it is not only practically impossible to manufacture, but even if it is possible, it will cause a large amount of capital backlog. (3) The ratio of the necessary installation quantity to the non-necessary installation quantity of equipment must be correctly grasped. In the preliminary equipment plan proposed by some bureaus this year, the necessary installation quantity is only 52 percent, and the non-necessary installation quantity is 48 percent. This ratio is obviously inappropriate. This inappropriate ratio shows that the planning agency has not fully considered the effect of investment, and it must be corrected in the review plan. (4) The balance work between the equipment needs and the equipment sources must be carried out. Only when these equipment have definite sources can the implementation of the capital construction plan have a reliable material foundation. Therefore, the view that equipment supply planning is optional must be opposed. Only with a plan can the blindness of equipment supply work be completely overcome.

    Second, improve equipment supply work. Equipment supply work is an extremely complex organizational and technical work. In capital construction, it is also an arduous task, including equipment ordering, organization of production, allocation and scheduling, transportation and supply, receiving and inspection, and warehouse storage. In order to do a good job in equipment supply, the following is required: (1) To recognize the complexity of the current equipment supply work, which includes domestic ordering and foreign ordering; main equipment and auxiliary equipment; machine equipment, electrical equipment, instrument meters, etc. If any of these equipment fail to arrive on time, it will delay the start of construction. Therefore, there must be a set of equipment management systems (such as a complete set of equipment delivery catalog, equipment arrival, inspection and acceptance, machine trial installation, etc.). (2) To effectively grasp the equipment supply situation on a project-by-project basis (especially for key projects), especially to grasp the key equipment among them, to ensure the on-time completion of major projects. (3) To pay close attention to the technical work of equipment supply. Some leading cadres believe that only a few general procurement personnel can handle the equipment supply work, which is obviously impossible. For example, in 1953, Dongchuan Copper Mine ordered eight storage battery locomotives from abroad, with the specification of overhead motor locomotives, which were found by technicians to be unusable in the mine. If other mines cannot use it either, it has actually caused a backlog. (4) To regularly check the progress of ordering. The idea that everything is fine after the contract is signed is completely wrong. For example, in 1952, Anshan Iron and Steel ordered 22 cranes from Dalian No. 17 Factory, but had not checked the manufacturing factory for more than half a year, so that not a single piece of equipment was delivered by the deadline. Bureaucracy in this equipment supply work must be severely opposed.

    Third, strengthen equipment management and conscientiously implement the economic accounting system in equipment management. In this regard, there are still many wasteful phenomena. Therefore, in the future, orders must be placed after careful planning and design. We must vigorously reduce transportation and miscellaneous expenses (some units even put the transportation and miscellaneous expenses plan at 60 to 70 percent), we must improve technical storage work, and at the same time, we must regularly carry out the balance and adjustment of stagnant equipment to reduce equipment backlog and give full play to the effectiveness of funds.

    Fourth, improve the organizational structure of equipment management. All bureaus, companies, and all major capital construction units must establish independent equipment offices or sections, and equipment work must be managed separately from materials work. Some units that still do not have specialized institutions should be established quickly, and those that are not yet sound should be strengthened quickly. In equipment management and equipment organizational structure, the establishment of a responsibility system must be emphasized to oppose the phenomenon of no one being responsible for various aspects of equipment management.

    重视设备供应工作
    ——“重工业通讯”第四期社论摘要
    一个工厂、矿山的建设，必需经过勘察、设计、施工、安装、试运转等过程。现在在加强资源勘察工作、壮大设计、施工力量等方面已经开始引起了各个基本建设单位的注意，并且有了初步的转变。但是，完成今年基本建设计划的另一项重要工作——设备供应工作，尚未引起各局、公司及基本建设单位的足够重视。这是因为这些领导同志没有认识到设备供应工作的性质及其目前在基本建设工作中的地位。
    首先，这些领导同志没有深刻了解基本建设归根结蒂是为了建立具有巨大生产能力的现代化工厂和矿山，而不只是盖房子。任何一所工厂或矿山，如果没有装起机器，没有生产工具，是不可能生产任何产品的。实践已一再证明了设备供应工作对于基本建设计划完成的决定性影响。例如一九五二年某一个钢铁公司的炼铁高炉的建设计划，就是仅仅由于一个瓦斯燃烧器未能按时到货，因而使开工日期延迟了三个月。因此我们所有基本建设单位，不仅要掌握土木建筑及其平衡，更必须掌握设备需要及其来源的平衡工作；不仅要知道修建多少平方公尺房子，而且必须要熟知安装多少台机器与多少吨机器。
    其次，这些领导同志之所以不重视设备供应工作，还由于他们没有深刻认识到国家大规模建设已经开始，我们正在建设对国家工业化有决定意义的一些重要工厂和矿山。这些新建或改建的企业所需要的设备，是数量复杂、品种繁多、技术规格要求严格的成套设备。这些企业只有有了这些技术装备，才能真正建设起来。因此今天的设备供应工作，与恢复时期只需要进行些零星补充的情况已根本不同，因而必须改变那种把设备与建筑材料混为一谈的旧观念，否则就必然会降低设备供应工作的地位。所有各个基本建设单位，必须把设备供应工作当作一项重大的任务来管理。只熟悉砖、瓦、砂、石、钢筋、木材、水泥，而不熟悉上千种复杂的设备，是不能适合目前基本建设的要求的。
    再次，这些领导同志之所以不重视设备供应工作，还由于他们没有深刻分析每项投资计划的构成，他们还不深知设备在投资中的比重。从一九五三年年度计划看，设备占全年投资近百分之四十；从长期计划看，设备占全部投资百分之四十五，如果我们在这方面的工作发生了严重缺点，则毫无疑问，基本建设计划是根本不可能完成的。以今年重工业部基本建设工作中的——地质坑探任务而论，就需十几种设备（如空气压缩机、锻钎机、凿岩机、卷扬机、局部扇风机、送风机、水泵、深井水泵、矿车等）六千余台，但到目前为止，仅初步解决了需要量的六分之一，如果我们不尽最大努力加以解决，则今年坑探任务，不是被迫削减，就是不能完成计划。因此那种把设备供应工作只认为是琐碎的事务，而不从领导上加以重视并加强这方面的组织工作的作法，必然会使得基本建设计划不能完成。
    再次，这些领导同志之所以不重视设备供应工作，还由于他们还没有深刻了解我们所需设备的数量与品种和目前可能的来源还存在着若干的不相适应，他们还保留着恢复时期的老观念，以为建设中只需要补充一些机器设备，这些机器设备又是随便找一个机器工厂进行加工订货就可以了。殊不知在整个国家的建设过程中，各种主要工业必须相互配合地发展，我们不能够也不应该要求机器制造工业随时供应我们任意提出的各种设备。如果我们不尽可能地把所需设备的规格加以简化，则会因为规格品种过于繁杂，而降低机器制造工业品的生产能力，这不仅对于机器制造工业的发展有关，而且实际上会影响整个工业的发展。因此就一方面要求我们根据可能，来精确地制订计划（不能在数量上提出过多、在品种上提出过繁的要求）；另一方面就必须在国家统一计划下加强组织管理国内国外的设备订货工作。如果我们在这方面有任何的松懈现象，都会给基本建设带来不可弥补的损失。因此，为了从根本上改善目前设备供应工作，各局、公司及基本建设单位，首先就应从认识上转变。在基本建设管理中把设备供应工作提到重要地位。
    为了改善设备供应与管理工作，应进行以下几项具体工作：
    第一、作好设备供应计划。为了作好设备计划，就需要：（1）凡是重要工程所需要的设备，必须经过初步设计后才能提出订货。因为只有经过设计，才能周密地计算其需要量，并作出技术规格。凡是不经过严格设计程序的工程项目，如地质钻探、建筑机械，也必须在精确计算设备技术定额后，提出设备需要量。必须反对设备计划工作的盲目性。例如东川铜矿为了完成今年探矿任务，在计划上提出十二台二百马力空气压缩机，但按设备技术能力的计算，六台就够用了。如果将这样不准确的计划提出，必然浪费了国家大量资金。因此要想作好设备需要计划，首先就要依靠周密的设计工作与掌握设备技术定额。（2）设备供应必须与工程计划相适应。任何工程项目，都必须作设备需要的进度计划。在制订设备需要进度计划时应充分估计到设备制造的时间，在制订工程计划时，要精确计算设备供应的可能性。但也必须反对那种把全年设备需要量都提到第一季设备平衡计划内的作法，因为不仅制造上实际不可能，而且即使可能，也会造成大量资金积压。（3）必须正确掌握设备必需安装量与非必需安装量的比例。今年有的局初步提出的设备计划，必需安装量仅为百分之五十二，非必需安装量为百分之四十八，这个比例显然是不恰当的。这种不恰当的比例说明了制订计划的机关没有充分考虑到投资的效果，在审核计划中必须加以改正。（4）必须进行设备需要量与设备来源的平衡工作，只有这些设备有了确切的来源，才使基本建设计划的执行有了可靠的物质基础。因此必须反对那种认为设备供应计划可有可无的观点，只有有了计划，才能彻底克服设备供应工作的盲目性。
    第二、改善设备供应工作。设备供应工作是个极端复杂的组织工作与技术工作。在基本建设中，也是一个繁重的工作任务，它包括设备订货、组织生产、分配调度、运输供应、接收点验及仓库保管等。为了作好设备供应工作，必须：（1）要认识目前设备供应工作的复杂性，它有国内订货和国外订货；有主要设备和辅助设备；有机器设备、电气设备、仪表计器等。这些设备中任何一件不按期到货，都将延误开工时机，因此必须有一套设备管理制度（如成套设备发货目录表、设备到货、检查验收、机器试安装等）。（2）要切实以工程为单位
    （特别对重点工程）来掌握设备供应情况，尤其要掌握其中带关键性的设备，以保证主要工程的按期完工。（3）要十分注意设备供应的技术工作。有的领导干部认为只要几个一般的采购人员，就可以把设备供应工作办好，这显然是不可能的。如东川铜矿一九五三年向国外订购蓄电池机车八台，规格为架空电机车，经技术人员检查后认为不能在该矿山使用。如其他矿山也不能使用，实际上已造成积压。（4）要经常检查订货进行情况。那种认为订了合同就万事大吉的想法是完全错误的。如一九五二年鞍钢在大连十七厂订购二十二台吊车，半年多未曾到制造厂检查过，以致该项设备到期一台也未交出，这种设备供应工作中的官僚主义必须严厉反对。
    第三、加强设备管理，认真贯彻设备管理中的经济核算制。在这方面，目前还存在许多浪费现象，为此，今后必须经过周密计划与设计方能提出订货。必须大力减少运杂费开支（有的单位竟把运杂费计划提到百分之六十到七十），必须改善技术保管工作，同时要经常进行呆滞设备的平衡与调剂工作，以减少设备积压，发挥资金的效能。
    第四、健全设备管理的组织机构。所有各局、公司及所有的主要基本建设单位，必需成立独立的设备处或科，必须把设备工作同材料工作分开管理。有些单位至今尚无专门机构者，应即迅速建立，至今尚不健全者，应迅速加强。在设备管理及设备组织机构中，必须强调建立责任制，以反对设备管理中各种无人负责现象。
