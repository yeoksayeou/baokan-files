    Xi'an City Greatly Improves Environmental Sanitation
    After the spring patriotic health campaign, Xi'an City has greatly improved its environmental sanitation.
    In order to make Xi'an a fly-free city this year, the people of Xi'an vigorously carried out the work of digging up fly pupae and renovating toilets during the campaign. More than 13,000 jin of fly pupae have been dug up in the city, and the toilet renovation work has also been completed. In addition, more than 50,000 houses were cleaned, and more than 410,000 quilts were taken apart and washed. According to incomplete statistics from eight districts, a total of more than 11,800 tons of garbage and more than 3,800 tons of feces were removed.
    Now, the patriotic health campaign in Xi'an has become a regular mass work. Each district has adopted the method of dividing areas and sections for contracted responsibility to maintain the regular cleanliness of the entire city. In addition to the public areas being regularly cleaned by the city's cleaning team, residents near "three-no-management" areas have also organized mutual aid groups: Residents in streets and alleys take turns cleaning the streets and alleys every day, and residents' courtyards are swept as soon as they are dirty to prevent dust and garbage from accumulating.

    西安市大大改善了环境卫生状况
    西安市经过春季爱国卫生突击运动，大大改善了环境卫生状况。
    西安市人民为了争取今年西安成为无蝇城市，在突击运动中大力进行了挖掘蝇蛹、翻修厕所等工作。全市已挖掘蝇蛹一万三千多斤，厕所整修工作也已完成。此外，并打扫了五万多间房屋，拆洗了四十一万多条被褥；据八个区的不完全统计，共清除了垃圾一万一千八百多吨，粪便三千八百多吨。
    现在，西安市爱国卫生运动已成为经常性的群众工作，各区采取分区分段包干负责的办法，保持整个城市经常的清洁。除了公用地段由市清洁大队定时清扫外；“三不管”地区附近的居民也组织了互助组：大街小巷的居民每日轮流地把街巷清扫干净，居民院落作到了随脏随扫不让尘土垃圾堆积。
