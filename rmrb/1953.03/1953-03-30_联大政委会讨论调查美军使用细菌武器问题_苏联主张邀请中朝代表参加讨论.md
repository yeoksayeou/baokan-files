Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 29th: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee began discussing the agenda item "Impartial Investigation of Accusations Regarding the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by American Troops" at its meeting on the 27th.

    Soviet Representative V.A. Zorin spoke first at the meeting. He pointed out that since the Political Committee was about to discuss the issue of an impartial investigation into the accusations regarding the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, as proposed by the US delegation, the Soviet delegation considered it necessary to suggest that the Political Committee invite representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion of the aforementioned issue.

    Zorin stated that it goes without saying that only the participation of representatives from countries directly involved in this matter and harmed by bacteriological warfare can ensure a truly fair and objective discussion of the investigation into the facts of the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. Without the participation of representatives from the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the discussion of this issue, it would mean a pre-emptive refusal to resolve this issue objectively and fairly. It would mean that, during the Political Committee's discussion of this issue, the party accused of using such despicable warfare methods could, according to their prejudice, pre-emptively influence the course of the discussion. Therefore, the Soviet delegation believes that the Political Committee will surely recognize that conducting such a one-sided discussion of this issue is incorrect and proposes the following suggestion: invite the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to send representatives to participate in the discussion of this issue.

    Representatives from the United States, Peru, Greece, and the Kuomintang opposed the Soviet proposal.

    Representatives from Poland and Indonesia supported the Soviet proposal. Indonesian delegation leader, Mr. Bala, supported the Soviet proposal, saying that without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it would be impossible to discuss the issue of the use of bacteriological weapons in China and Korea fairly and objectively. If we want to discuss this issue fairly and sincerely, then we should invite representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the Political Committee. This would be a constructive contribution to the Political Committee's discussion of the accusations of the use of bacteriological weapons in China and Korea. The Indonesian representative urged the representatives of all countries on the Political Committee not to repeat the tragic old path taken by the Security Council last July; at that time, the majority of representatives in the Security Council refused to invite representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea. Bala reminded everyone to pay attention to the generally accepted method of discussing disputes, which is to invite both sides of the dispute and listen to their opinions. Therefore, he agreed with the view that any proposal regarding an investigation into the use of bacteriological weapons in China and Korea would have no practical value without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    Seeing that the discussion of the Soviet proposal was becoming unfavorable to the United States, the Australian representative proposed to stop the discussion. Although some delegations expressed opposition to the Australian proposal, the chairman of the committee still put the Australian proposal to a vote, and as a result, the majority of delegations, led by the US representative, passed the proposal. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Poland, India, Indonesia, Burma, and Afghanistan opposed the proposal. Representatives from fourteen countries abstained.

    The Soviet proposal to invite representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was then put to a vote. Delegations from fifteen countries supported the proposal: the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Syria, Iran, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Burma, Afghanistan, and Yemen. Delegations from five countries abstained. Representatives from forty countries, including the United States, Britain, France, and Australia, voted against the Soviet proposal.

    Ukrainian Representative A.M. Baranovsky explained his reasons for voting, saying that the committee's rejection of the Soviet proposal to invite representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea predetermines that the discussion of the issue of the use of bacteriological weapons in China and Korea is biased, not fair.

    Baranovsky said that the Ukrainian delegation believes that such a decision is unreasonable and unfair, and therefore believes that this decision precisely demonstrates the intention of the United States and some other countries to avoid an objective study of the issue raised by the US delegation itself.

    Indian Representative Dayal explained his reasons for voting, saying that the Indian delegation supported the Soviet proposal and firmly believed that a fair and objective investigation was only possible with the participation of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Dayal said that without the participation of representatives from Korea and China in the investigation, any investigation into the facts would be unobjective.

    Syrian Representative Tarazi pointed out that the Syrian delegation had insisted in the past and still insists now on the principle of inviting both parties to resolve disputes. The General Assembly cannot make an objective resolution based solely on the facts presented by one party to the dispute. Because of this view, the Syrian delegation supports the Soviet delegation's just proposal.

    The committee moved on to a discussion of the substantive issues. US Representative Gross spoke, denying the well-known fact that US armed forces used bacteriological weapons in Korea, and at the same time made formulaic attacks on the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Finally, on behalf of the sixteen countries participating in the Korean War with the United States, he put forward a proposal recommending that a committee of five countries be formed to "investigate" accusations regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by US armed forces in Korea and China. Representatives from Australia and the Union of South Africa spoke in support of this proposal.

    Representatives from the Netherlands and New Zealand, as well as Kuomintang elements, rambled on and on about many issues that were completely unrelated to the issue of the US armed forces' use of bacteriological weapons against the people of Korea and China, attempting to disrupt the proceedings and prevent the Political Committee from truly studying the issue of the US's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

    Czechoslovakian Representative Vavricka spoke, pointing out that the Czechoslovakian delegation firmly opposed the so-called "investigation" method proposed by the United States. Vavricka said that the US delegation's opposition to the Soviet proposal to invite representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion, the US delegation's speech itself was enough to illustrate the US's attempt to evade a fair investigation into this issue.

    The Czechoslovakian representative pointed out: how can one talk about a "fair" investigation of accusations or discussion of the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China if the United States acts as prosecutor, judge, and witness on the committee, while representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have no opportunity to express their opinions and present various facts on the issues under discussion?

    Vavricka pointed out that the US delegation's approach violates the generally accepted practices in the work of the United Nations General Assembly, its committees, and the Security Council, and it is not the first time it has adopted this approach.

    The Czechoslovakian representative then cited statements and assessments made by prominent scientists from Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, Brazil, and certain other countries who had personally gone to the site to investigate the US's use of bacteriological weapons, the confessions of captured US Air Force pilots and officers, and the statements of prominent US political and military leaders. Vavricka said that all of these irrefutable materials undoubtedly prove that the United States has used bacteriological weapons in Korea and China and attempts to continue to use them in the future. The fact that the United States has refused to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological warfare to this day also proves this fact precisely. The United States is unwilling to ratify this protocol in order to avoid being constrained in the future when using bacteriological weapons.

    The committee adjourned after the Czechoslovakian representative spoke.

    联大政委会讨论调查美军使用细菌武器问题
    苏联主张邀请中朝代表参加讨论
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：联合国大会政治委员会二十七日会议开始讨论议程上的“公正调查关于美国军队使用细菌武器的控诉”的议案。
    苏联代表瓦·阿·佐林在会上首先发言，他指出，由于政治委员会马上就要讨论美国代表团所提出的公正地调查关于在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的控诉的问题，苏联代表团认为有必要建议政治委员会邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加上述问题的讨论。
    佐林声称，不必说，只有与这事直接有关以及受细菌战之害的国家的代表参加，才能真正公正和客观地讨论关于调查在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的事实的问题。没有中华人民共和国政府及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的代表参加讨论这一问题，这就意味着，预先拒绝客观地和公正地去解决这一问题。这就意味着，在政治委员会讨论这个问题时，被控诉使用这种可耻的战争手段的一方可以随他们的偏见，预先左右这个讨论的进程。因此苏联代表团认为政治委员会一定会承认这样片面地进行讨论这一问题是不正确的，并提出下列建议：邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府派遣代表参加讨论这一问题。
    美国、秘鲁、希腊、国民党代表反对苏联的提议。
    波兰和印度尼西亚代表赞成苏联的提议。印度尼西亚代表团团长巴拉支持苏联的提议，他说：没有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加，就不可能公正地和客观地讨论在中国和朝鲜使用细菌武器的问题。如果我们要公正和诚恳地讨论这个问题，那末我们就应当邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表到政治委员会里来。这在政治委员会讨论关于在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的控诉案时将是一个建设性的贡献。印度尼西亚的代表敦促政治委员会的各国代表不要再走去年七月安全理事会所走过的悲惨的老路；当时，安全理事会中大多数代表都拒绝邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的代表参加讨论在朝鲜使用细菌武器的问题。巴拉提醒大家注意，一般公认的讨论争端的办法是邀请争执双方，并听取双方的意见。因此，他同意这种看法：任何关于调查在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的建议，如果没有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加，就不会有实际的价值。
    澳大利亚代表看到对苏联建议的讨论变得对美国不利，于是提议停止讨论。尽管有一些代表团表示反对澳大利亚的提议，委员会主席仍把澳大利亚的提议交付表决，结果以美国代表为首的大多数代表团通过了这个提议。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、阿富汗的代表反对这个提议。十四个国家的代表弃权。
    苏联关于邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的提案随即交付表决。有十五个国家的代表团赞成这个提案，它们是：苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、叙利亚、伊朗、印度、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、埃及、缅甸、阿富汗、也门。五个国家的代表团弃权。包括美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚在内的四十个国家的代表投票反对苏联的提案。
    乌克兰代表安·麦·巴拉诺夫斯基说明他投票的理由时说道：委员会否决苏联关于邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表的提议，就预先决定了关于在中国和朝鲜使用细菌武器问题的讨论是偏袒的，而不是公正的。
    巴拉诺夫斯基说：乌克兰代表团认为这样的决定是不合理的，是不公道的，因而认为这种决定正说明了美国和其他一些国家有意避免客观地研究美国代表团本身所提出的问题。
    印度代表达雅尔解释他投票的理由说：印度代表团赞成苏联的提议，并且深信，只有中华人民共和国及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国参加，才可能进行公正和客观的调查。达雅尔说：没有朝鲜和中国代表参加调查，对事实的任何调查都是不客观的。
    叙利亚代表塔拉齐指出，叙利亚代表团过去曾坚持、现在也还坚持邀请双方解决争端的原则。大会不可能仅仅根据争执一方所提的事实而作出客观的决议。由于这一种见解，叙利亚代表团赞成苏联代表团的公正的提议。
    委员会进入实质问题的讨论。美国代表葛罗斯发言，他否认了世所共知的美国武装部队在朝鲜使用细菌武器的事实，同时对苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国作了公式化的攻讦。最后他代表与美国共同参加朝鲜战争的十六个国家提出提案，其中建议由五个国家组成委员会，以“调查”关于美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的控诉。澳大利亚和南非联邦的代表发言支持这一提案。
    荷兰与新西兰的代表及国民党分子在会上絮絮不休地谈了许多跟美国武装部队对朝中人民使用细菌武器的问题毫不相干的问题，企图从中扰乱，使政治委员会不能真正研究美国在朝鲜与中国使用细菌武器的问题。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表瓦夫里茨卡发言指出，捷克斯洛伐克代表团坚决反对美国提出的所谓“调查”方法。瓦夫里茨卡说，美国代表团反对苏联提出的邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国的代表参加讨论的建议，美国代表团的发言本身就足以说明了美国企图规避对这个问题进行公正的调查。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表指出：如果美国在委员会中担任检察官、法官与证人，而中华人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表却没有机会在这里发表他们的意见并对讨论中的问题提出各项事实，这如何谈得上“公正”调查控诉或讨论在朝鲜与中国使用细菌武器呢？
    瓦夫里茨卡指出：美国代表团这种办法是违反联合国大会、它的各委员会以及安全理事会的工作中公认的惯例的，它已经不是第一次采用这种办法了。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表接着引证了曾亲赴现场调查美国使用细菌武器的英国、法国、比利时、意大利、巴西和某些其他国家的著名科学家们的声明和他们作出的鉴定，被俘美国空军驾驶员和军官的供词以及美国著名政治领袖和军事领袖的谈话。瓦夫里茨卡说：所有这些不容辩驳的材料毫无疑问地证明了：美国已经在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器，并企图在将来继续使用。美国一直到今天还拒绝批准一九二五年禁止细菌战的日内瓦议定书也就恰恰证明了这个事实。美国不愿意批准这个议定书，是为了免得将来使用细菌武器时受到约束。
    委员会在捷克斯洛伐克代表发言之后宣告休会。
