The unfortunate news spread to Shijingshan, and young workers burst into tears, while older workers remained silent, recalling their painful lives and today's happiness from the passing of their mentor. Technicians' faces changed, and they were speechless for half an hour, many in tears.

The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held a meeting of Party and Youth League branch secretaries, as well as section chiefs and plant-level cadres, at 4:00 PM on the sixth. At the meeting, everyone expressed deep condolences for the passing of their mentor and held a solemn oath-taking ceremony. Everyone raised their hands and pledged to transform grief into strength, to fulfill Comrade Mao Zedong's three major appeals, and to do a good job in the three central tasks stipulated by the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry. At the same time, they would heighten vigilance, strengthen the unity between the Chinese and Soviet people, and fight to the end to defend world peace.

The workers firmly believe in the unparalleled strength of the peace camp and firmly believe that the great ally, the Soviet Union, will smoothly move towards communism and will continue to serve as the pillar of the peace movement. Party members unanimously expressed to the Party organization that they would unconditionally obey the Party's assignments and resolutely complete all tasks assigned by the Party. Youth League members and the masses of workers, many expressed their determination to strive to join the Party. A comrade in the steel plant who was previously uneasy in his work, swore to everyone at this time: Wherever I am transferred, I will go, and I guarantee to settle down and do all the work assigned by the organization, preparing to strive to join the Party. The workers are discussing the 1953 plan. Now everyone is taking the planning work more seriously. The Engineering Company guarantees to do a good job in the preparatory work, and the Design Office said that it will make advanced designs. Mourning Comrade Stalin has aroused everyone's higher enthusiasm for learning from the Soviet Union.

On the evening of March 7th, the Shijingshan Power Plant held a memorial meeting. All employees and their families, as well as the Young Pioneers of the employee children's school, also attended the meeting. Li Shouqi, Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Party of China at the Shijingshan Power Plant, and labor model Liu Dezhen both spoke at the meeting. Liu Dezhen stood in front of the portrait in tears and raised his hand to swear, guaranteeing to study hard the immortal works left by Comrade Stalin, and to earnestly learn from Soviet experience, determined to shorten the steam turbine maintenance time by 20% on the basis of the existing plan. Many people were prepared to speak at the meeting to express their deep condolences for Comrade Stalin. However, grief prevented them from speaking. They will use practical actions to express their mourning for their mentor.

The workers of Factory 25463 were very saddened after hearing this unfortunate news. After returning to their dormitories, more than a dozen workers in the Inspection Section wrote down the time of Comrade Stalin's death in their work diaries. Worker Bai Zhikai said: I will never forget this time. In the future, whenever I encounter any difficulties, as long as I think of this time, I will have the confidence and courage to overcome all difficulties and complete the tasks assigned to me by the higher authorities. Bai Zhikai is the leader of the trade union group. He has always been very responsible for his work, but he is very impatient and often quarrels with the production team leader Liu Yuxi over work matters; their relationship is very bad. After hearing the news of Comrade Stalin's death, and hearing the call of the Party Committee, Bai Zhikai felt extremely sad. He reviewed his past mistakes and apologized to Liu Yuxi. The two shook hands intimately, expressing their determination to unite and do a good job in production in the future.

In order to mourn Comrade Stalin, the Party branch of the second workshop of the factory mobilized all Communist Party members, Youth League members, and all workers to find 300 tricks in March. The workers of Zhang Deshan's group immediately took action. At around 2:00 PM on the 7th, worker Zhang Likun tried to improve the operating method and saved materials. Originally, when he did this job, one steel material could only produce six qualified products. After improving the operating method, one steel material could produce seven qualified products. Originally, Guan Duohuan, Zhang Zitan, and Zhang Shusen did one job, but today they tried to transform the tools. As a result, the work of three people only needs two people to do. In just these two or three hours, Zhang Deshan's group found two tricks. Labor model and Communist Party member Li Jingbo is now planning to further develop the potential of the machine, striving to increase work efficiency by another 100% from the current level in the entire woodworking department by October 1st. He also wants to mobilize masters to mentor apprentices, striving to enable all apprentices to master certain skills in three to five months. All cadres and workers in the first workshop guarantee to complete the production tasks ahead of schedule and fulfill the external contact contracts.

The workers of the Beijing Clothing Factory are determined to transform grief into strength. Zhang Huizhen, the leader of the group that won the title of Beijing Model Group, said: "We must repay Stalin's kindness with doubled efforts." The workers of Zhang Huizhen's group deeply felt the honor brought to them by Comrade Stalin. This group learned from the advanced experience of Soviet workers led and cultivated by the wise Stalin—the assembly line method—which improved the group's output and inspired the production enthusiasm of the sewing workers throughout the factory, thus winning the glorious title of model group. The letter of comfort proposing to strive to complete the production task guarantee had not yet been sent when the unfortunate news came. They wiped away their tears and promised to further work hard in production.

Worker Wang Guiying of the sewing department has studied hard and mastered the Soviet advanced experience of Guo Walyov's method of learning from others' strengths and making up for one's weaknesses, integrating the different advantages of Tao Meizhen, Tang Weiming, and Duan Baozhu in the same factory, improving his own operations, and greatly increasing production. Therefore, he won the honorary title of Beijing Labor Model. During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" activities, he also received a reward from the factory for learning and promoting advanced Soviet experience. After hearing the unfortunate news of Comrade Stalin's death, he was very sad. He said: "I want to learn from the great Stalin's tireless spirit of serving the cause of the working people, further learn from advanced Soviet experience, and overfulfill production tasks. I will use this concrete action to mourn Comrade Stalin."

All the staff and workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory are in extreme grief. However, the staff and workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory also understand that they should transform infinite grief into a strong and invincible force, so that the cause of human liberation led by Comrade Stalin throughout his life can advance more rapidly. Many people wrote their loyal vows in their diaries; some groups and departments began to check and improve their work. The workers of the second lathe group decided to work harder, think of ways to improve their work, strengthen technical learning, strengthen inspection, strengthen the planning of their work, and pay attention to safety after hearing the news of Comrade Stalin's serious illness on the 5th. The Chen Yongxiang model group of the forging workshop is determined to set a good production plan for this year, strive to reduce the reject rate of products, and put forward specific guarantees. Comrade Huang Runping, the head of the warehouse management section, was extremely sad. He decided to study Marxism-Leninism well, improve the warehouse management work to a higher level, and publicize and explain the three instructions put forward by Chairman Mao to the people of the whole country this year to mourn his most beloved Comrade Stalin. The comrades in the planning section were working more intensively on the afternoon of the 6th. They believe that only if everyone works more selflessly can they slightly make up for this immeasurable loss.

    北京市工人痛悼斯大林同志逝世
    决心更加团结努力生产，积极学习苏联先进经验
    不幸的消息传到石景山以后，年青的工人们失声痛哭，老工人们默默无言，从导师的逝世回想起自己大半生的痛苦生涯和今天的幸福。技术人员们脸色变了，半个多钟头说不出话来，很多人在流泪。
    石景山钢铁厂六日下午四时召开了党和青年团的支部书记以及科长、场长级干部会议。会议上大家为导师的逝世表示沉痛的悼念并举行了庄严的宣誓。大家举手保证要化悲痛为力量，保证做好毛泽东同志的三大号召，做好中央重工业部规定的三项中心工作。同时提高警惕做好保卫工作，加强中苏人民的团结为保卫世界和平奋斗到底。
    职工们坚信和平阵营力量的无比坚强，坚信伟大盟邦苏联将顺利走向共产主义，将继续作为和平运动的支柱。党员们一致地向党组织表示，要无条件地服从党的分配，坚决完成党交给的一切任务。青年团员们，职工群众们，许多人表示了争取入党的决心。钢铁厂一位做事务工作的同志过去不安心工作，这时向大家宣誓：以后调到那里就去那里，保证安心做好一切组织所分配的工作，准备争取入党。职工们正在讨论一九五三年的计划。现在大家对计划工作更认真了。工程公司保证要做好准备工作，设计处表示要做出先进的设计。悼念斯大林同志，激起了大家学习苏联的更高的热情。
    三月七日晚石景山发电厂举行了追悼大会。全体职工和家属及职工子弟学校的少年儿童队员们也都参加了大会。中共石景山发电厂总支书记李寿祺和劳动模范刘德珍都在大会上讲了话。刘德珍痛哭着站在遗像前举手宣誓，保证努力学习斯大林同志遗留下来的不朽著作，并认真地学习苏联经验，决心在现有计划的基础上，把汽机检修时间缩短百分之二十。许多人都准备在大会上发言，表示对斯大林同志的深痛的悼念。但是，悲痛使他们不能发言。他们将用实际的行动表示自己对导师的悼念。
    二五四六三工厂工人们听到这一不幸的消息后，十分难过。检验科十几个工人回到宿舍以后，把斯大林同志逝世的时间记在工作日记上。工人白志楷说：我永远不会忘掉这个时间。今后遇到什么困难，只要想到这个时间，我就有信心有勇气去克服一切困难，完成上级交给我的任务。白志楷是工会小组长，他一贯对工作很负责任，但是个性很急，常常为了工作和生产组长刘玉玺争吵；关系很不好。白志楷听了斯大林同志病逝的消息后，又听了党委的号召，心里难过极了。他检讨了自己过去的错误，并向刘玉玺道歉，两个人亲密地握手，表示今后决心团结一致，搞好生产。
    该厂二车间党支部为了悼念斯大林同志，发动全体共产党员、青年团员及全体职工，要在三月份找出三百个窍门。张德山小组的工人马上就行动起来了。七日下午两点多，工人张立堃想办法改进操作方法，节省了材料。原来他做这件活，一条钢料只出六块成活，改进操作方法以后，一条钢料可以出七块成活。原来关多欢、张子檀、张树森三个人作一个活，今天他们想办法改造了工具，结果三个人的活，只要两个人作就行了。就在这短短的两三个钟头内，张德山小组就找出了两个窍门。劳动模范、共产党员李静波现在计划进一步发挥机器的潜在力，争取在十月一日，全木工部要从现在的水平上，把工作效率再提高一倍。他并且要发动师父带徒弟。争取在三个月到五个月之间，使所有的徒工都能掌握一定技术。一车间的全体干部和工人，保证提前完成生产任务，实现对外的联系合同。
    北京被服厂的工人决心化悲痛为力量。该厂获得北京市模范小组称号的小组长张惠珍说：“我们要以加倍的努力来报答斯大林的恩情。”张惠珍小组的工人深切地感到斯大林同志带给他们的荣誉。他们这个小组是学习了英明的斯大林所领导和培养的苏联工人的先进经验——流水作业法，提高了小组的产量，鼓舞了全厂缝纫工人生产情绪，才获得模范小组这一光荣称号的。他们提出的努力完成生产任务保证的慰问信还不及发出，不幸的消息就传来了。他们擦干了眼泪，保证要进一步努力生产。
    缝纫部工人王贵营曾刻苦学习，掌握了苏联先进经验郭瓦廖夫取长补短的工作方法，综合了同厂陶美珍、唐伟明、段宝柱不同优点的技术，改进了自己的操作，大大提高了生产量。所以获得了北京市劳动模范的光荣称号。在“中苏友好月”活动中，他还得到了全厂学习并推广苏联先进经验的奖励。他听到斯大林同志逝世的不幸消息后，非常悲痛，他说：“我要学习伟大的斯大林同志为劳动人民事业服务的不倦精神，更进一步地学习苏联先进经验，超额完成生产任务。用这一具体行动来悼念斯大林同志。”
    华北农业机械总厂的全体职工都万分悲痛。但是，华北农业机械总厂的职工也都懂得应该把无穷悲痛化为坚强无敌的力量，使斯大林同志毕生所领导的人类解放事业能够更加飞速地前进。许多人在日记本上写上了自己的忠实誓言；有些小组、科室开始检查和改进自己的工作。车工二组的工人在五日听到斯大林同志患重病的消息后，就决定要更加努力生产，想改进工作的办法，加强技术学习；加强检查；加强工作的计划性和注意安全。锻工车间陈永祥模范小组决心订好今年的生产计划，努力降低产品的废品率，并提出了具体的保证。仓库管理股长黄润萍同志极其悲痛，他决定好好学习马克思列宁主义，把仓库管理工作更加提高一步，并向群众宣传解释毛主席今年向全国人民提出的三点指示，来悼念他最敬爱的斯大林同志。计划科的同志们六日下午更加紧张地工作着，他们认为，只有每个人都更加忘我的工作才能稍稍弥补这个不可计量的损失。
