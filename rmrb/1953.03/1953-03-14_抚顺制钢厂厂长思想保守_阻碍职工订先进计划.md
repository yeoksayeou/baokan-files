Fushun Steel Plant Director's Conservative Thinking
    Hinders Workers from Setting Advanced Plans

[This newspaper dispatch] According to the Northeast Daily: The Fushun Steel Plant headquarters encountered obstruction from the conservative thinking of the plant director, Lu Shaopu, when discussing and formulating production plans.

Before formulating the production plan, the plant's leading cadres did not investigate and study the problems in production, nor did they lead relevant personnel to analyze the potential strength in production. They only sent a few planning staff to the workshops to understand the situation, and formulated various indicators based on the highest and lowest quotas in the past, using a compromise method. Lu Shaopu considered such indicators to be "very advanced." When Liu Changgang, the director of the steelmaking workshop, suggested that the indicators could be further improved if the plant headquarters could help solve problems such as changing the position of the crane and increasing the number of crane ladles, Lu Shaopu raised many "difficulties," saying that this indicator could not be improved. He believed that the weather was hot in summer, there were no refrigerators in the workshop, and the workers' attendance rate was low; the equipment capacity was low, and he was afraid that the steel forging would not be produced; he was afraid that the quality would decline if the output increased; and he was afraid of more accidents. He only raised these difficulties, but did not consider ways to overcome them. He said: "We oppose conservatism, but we must also oppose adventurism!" Some cadres pointed out that there were many favorable conditions in the plant, for example, there were more than 80 suggestions and advanced experiences from Soviet experts alone last year, most of which had not been promoted. Lu Shaopu replied: "Today we do not have the same conditions as the Soviet Union, so we have to do it according to our conditions." Therefore, the issue of promoting advanced experience was not studied during the discussion of the plan. Due to the plant director's serious conservative thinking, the plant's production plan has not been worked out after several discussions. The plant's Party committee did not conduct necessary criticism and ideological struggle against Lu Shaopu's conservative thinking.

    抚顺制钢厂厂长思想保守
    阻碍职工订先进计划
    【本报讯】据东北日报载：抚顺制钢厂厂部在讨论与制订生产计划时，遭到了厂长陆绍璞的保守思想的阻碍。
    该厂的领导干部在制订生产计划前，没有调查研究生产中的问题，没有领导有关人员分析生产中的潜在力量；仅派几个计划工作人员到各车间了解了一下情况，根据过去最高和最低的定额，用折衷的办法订出了各项指标。对这样的指标，陆绍璞认为是“很先进”的。当炼钢车间主任刘长刚提出如果厂部能帮助解决变更吊车位置、增加吊包等问题，指标可以再提高的时候，陆绍璞却提出了许多“困难”，说这个指标不可能提高。他认为夏季天热，场房里没有冷冻机，工人出勤率低；设备能力低，怕钢锻不出来；怕产量提高了质量要下降；怕事故多。他只提出这些困难，却不考虑克服这些困难的办法。他说：“我们反对保守，也得反对冒险啊！”有的干部指出厂内是存在许多有利条件的，譬如去年只是苏联专家的建议和先进经验就有八十多件，大部分没有推广。陆绍璞回答说：“今天我们不具备苏联那样的条件，只好按照我们的条件来做。”于是在讨论计划时就没有研究推广先进经验这一问题。由于厂长的保守思想严重，该厂的生产计划经过几次讨论，一直没有讨论出头绪来。对陆绍璞这种保守思想，该厂党委也没有进行必要的批判和展开思想斗争。
