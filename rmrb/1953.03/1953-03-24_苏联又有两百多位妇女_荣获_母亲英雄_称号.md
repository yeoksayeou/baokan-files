Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: TASS reports that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently decided to award the honorary title of "Mother Heroine" to more than two hundred women who have given birth to ten or more children. They will all receive certificates from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the "Mother Heroine" medal.

    In the Soviet Union, the number of families with many children is increasing year by year. Currently, there are approximately 38,000 families with ten children, and more than 3.8 million families with five or more children. The Soviet government regularly provides material assistance to families with many children. In 1952 alone, the state budget allocated 6.355 billion rubles for subsidies to mothers with many children. For example, Klavchuk Nie, a collective farm woman and mother of many children in the Vilnius District of the Lithuanian Republic, received a government subsidy of 34,000 rubles last year. The Soviet government has established medical institutions and children's welfare institutions throughout the country to help mothers take care of their children.

    苏联又有两百多位妇女
    荣获“母亲英雄”称号
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团最近决定把“母亲英雄”的光荣称号授给两百多位生育了十个或十多个孩子的妇女。她们都将得到苏联最高苏维埃主席团的奖状以及“母亲英雄”勋章。
    在苏联，子女众多的家庭的数目一年比一年多。目前，有十个孩子的家庭约有三万八千多户，有五个孩子以上的家庭有三百八十多万户。苏联政府经常给子女众多的家庭以物质上的帮助。单在一九五二年，国家预算中拨作多子母亲补助金的款项就有六十三亿五千五百万卢布。例如，立陶宛共和国维尔那区一个多子母亲——集体农妇克拉夫楚克湼，去年就领到了政府发给的补助金三万四千卢布。苏联政府在各地普遍设立了医疗机关和儿童福利机关，帮助母亲们照顾孩子。
