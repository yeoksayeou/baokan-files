    Zhengzhou People's Court Should Make a Self-Criticism Regarding the Wrongful Detention of Sun Jisheng
    A letter from Shi Hongwen and Dong Xinzhang of the Zhengzhou City People's Procuratorate, Henan Province: After the judicial reform movement, the Zhengzhou City People's Court still exhibits phenomena of handling cases with a bureaucratic attitude, without investigation or research. On the evening of December 16, 1952, Sun Jisheng, a farmer from Sunbazhai Village, Xiaolizhuang Township, Zhengzhou City Suburbs, went to Zhengzhou City to see a play with three companions. Because of the crowd, Sun Jisheng bumped into another farmer watching the play (from Changge County, also with several companions). Sun asked, "Why did you touch my hand?" That farmer said, "I lost money." Sun and others misunderstood, and the two sides began to quarrel. Both sides found a police officer on the street to reason with, and then went to the police station to resolve the matter. When it wasn't resolved, they went to the Public Security Bureau's Security Section, and finally to the City People's Court. The court clerk, Kou Jianchen, asked once and then arrested Sun, letting the others go back. After Sun arrived in prison, he was struggled against by the prisoners three times. Sun was an honest farmer and was very scared. Helpless and forced, he finally confessed: "I stole the money and shared it with my accomplices." The City People's Court did not conduct an in-depth investigation and detained Sun for ten days. The court's vice president, Zhang Rongji, even instructed: let Sun obtain bail and prepare the money quickly (to compensate the person who lost the money), and then convict him. Later, Sun paid 420,000 yuan to the court. After Sun was released from prison, he went to the Zhengzhou City People's Procuratorate to file a complaint. Now that the situation has been clarified, the court clerk, Kou Jianchen, has had to admit that he made a mistake. This incident has had a very bad impact on the masses. In order to reverse the impact, we believe that: in addition to immediately returning Sun's money and apologizing to Sun, the court should also make a public self-criticism.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    郑州市人民法院应对错押孙际圣事件作检讨
    河南省郑州市人民检察署史鸿文、董信章来信：司法改革运动后，郑州市人民法院仍然有着不调查、不研究，以官僚主义态度处理案件的现象。一九五二年十二月十六日晚，郑州市郊区小李庄乡孙八砦村农民孙际圣和同伴三人到郑州城里看戏。因人挤，孙际圣和看戏的另一农民（长葛县人，也有几个同伴一起）碰了一下。孙问：“你碰我的手干啥？”那个农民说：“我丢钱了。”孙等误会，双方因而争吵起来。双方找到街上的岗警说理，继又到派出所解决。没解决，又到市公安局治安科，最后转到市人民法院。该院书记员寇建臣问了一遍，便把孙押起，让其余的人回去。孙到监狱后，被犯人们斗争了三次。孙是老实农民，很害怕，被迫无奈，最后他只好供认：“这钱是我偷了，与同伙共分啦。”市人民法院不深入调查，一直把孙押了十天，该院副院长张荣吉竟又批示：让孙打保外出，迅速筹备款子（赔给失款人），然后判罪。后来，孙交了四十二万元给该院。孙出狱后，即到郑州市人民检察署控告。现在，情况弄明白了，该院书记员寇建臣也不得不承认办错了。这一事件在群众中造成很坏的影响。为了挽回影响，我们认为：该院除了立即把孙的钱退还、并向孙道歉外，还应该公开检讨。
