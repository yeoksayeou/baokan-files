According to the *Liberation Daily*: Cadres of East China level-one organs and Shanghai municipal organs have universally launched the study of documents commemorating Comrade Stalin.

The Party and administrative leadership of East China level-one organs attach great importance to this study. For example, the Organization Department, Propaganda Department, Rural Work Committee, United Front Work Department, and General Office of the East China Bureau, as well as many units under the East China Administrative Council, were mobilized and arranged by the main leaders of the administration or the Party. In order to strengthen the leadership of the study, the Party Committee of East China level-one organs also sent staff to assist units such as the East China Financial and Economic Committee and the East China Branch of Xinhua Bookstore.

Cadres in various organs are studying very seriously, and their speeches in discussions are active and universal. The blackboard newspaper of the China Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company's East China Regional Company has also become unprecedentedly active, and the person in charge of the blackboard newspaper can receive more than 50 manuscripts in a single day. Every morning, many people gather in front of the blackboard newspaper.

In studying the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin, cadres have received profound education. For example, through study and discussion, comrades from the East China Highway Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Communications have realized the maturity and consolidation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The most significant example is that on the second day after the death of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet Union's highest leading organs announced the very important resolution to appoint Malenkov as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union to ensure the uninterrupted and correct leadership of the Party and the government in the entire life of the country. This shows the great unity and the wise and decisive leadership of the Soviet Party and state. During the study, many comrades expressed that they would commemorate Comrade Stalin with practical actions of working hard and stepping up learning. Some members of the Communist Youth League in the Fieldwork Section of the Cotton Inspection Institute of the East China Textile Administration Bureau unanimously guaranteed that they would resolutely and happily complete all work that should be completed according to work needs in the future. Two non-Party comrades in the Bank of China took the initiative to propose to the Party branch during the study that they would like to serve as Party propagandists.

In order to help and promote the study of cadres throughout the city, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of Party member cadres above the section level on the morning of March 19, where Comrade Peng Boshan, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, made a report on "Several Issues in Studying Documents Commemorating Comrade Stalin," giving a brief and systematic explanation of the purpose, main content, and methods of this study, as well as Comrade Stalin's great contributions in theoretical and practical activities.

According to the regulations of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee that senior-level cadres must first study well, the 68 senior study groups of various organs in Shanghai are conducting their studies very seriously. Comrade Yang Rui, Minister of the Organization Department of the suburban district Party committee, often has to go out to inspect work, so in addition to participating in the discussions of his own group, he also participates in the study of cadres in the district when he goes down to the district. The senior study group of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's political and legal system once failed to adhere to the study system for a period of time, and recently held a meeting to make a review and formulated a specific plan for this study. Many senior study group cadres are actively reading reference books, such as "A Brief Biography of Stalin," Mao Zedong's "Stalin is a Friend of the Chinese People," and Chen Boda's "Stalin and the Chinese Revolution," and many comrades have reread them. On the basis of careful reading, the groups generally conducted discussions and chats, and senior study groups in seven units have already made enlightening reports to assist the study of cadres in their units.

The general cadres in Shanghai are also reading the documents very seriously and have conducted discussions. Many cadres expressed in the discussions that they would resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call, transform grief into strength, and commemorate Comrade Stalin with practical actions. Some cadres from the New Cheng District Cooperative and the Communist Youth League Working Committee compared Stalin's lifelong struggle for the cause of communism with their own selfishness and disunity, felt very ashamed, and expressed that they must overcome these shortcomings and resolutely learn from Stalin. Cadres from the Fourth Hospital affiliated with the Health Bureau also expressed during their studies that they would learn from Comrade Stalin's glorious qualities of being loyal to the people in the future and change their past work attitude of not treating patients carefully.

    华东一级机关和上海市各机关干部
    普遍学习悼念斯大林同志的文件
    据解放日报消息：华东一级机关和上海市各机关干部已普遍开展关于悼念斯大林同志文件的学习。
    华东一级机关的党和行政的领导方面，对这次学习都十分重视。如华东局组织部、宣传部、农村工作委员会、统战部、办公厅和华东行政委员会所属许多单位，都由行政或党的主要领导同志亲自动员布置。华东一级机关党委为了加强对学习的领导，还派了工作人员深入到华东财委、新华书店华东分店等单位进行协助。
    各机关的干部学习都很认真，在讨论中发言积极、普遍。中国花纱布公司华东区公司的黑板报也空前活跃起来，管理黑板报的人最多一天能收到五十多篇稿件。每天早晨在黑板报前总是围着很多的人。
    在学习悼念斯大林同志的文件中，干部们都受到深刻的教育。如中央交通部华东公路管理局的同志们，通过学习讨论，认识到苏联共产党的成熟和巩固。最显著的例子是在斯大林同志逝世的第二天，苏联最高领导机构就公布了为保证国家整个生活得到党和政府不间断的、正确的领导而作出建议任命马林科夫为苏联部长会议主席等非常重要的决议，这就表明了苏联党和国家的伟大的团结一致，和领导的英明果断。学习中，许多同志都表示将以努力工作、加紧学习的实际行动来悼念斯大林同志。华东纺织管理局棉检所外勤科有些青年团员一致保证今后将根据工作需要，坚决愉快完成一切应该完成的工作。中国银行有两个非党同志，在学习中自动向党支部提出，要求担任党的宣传员。
    中共上海市委为帮助和推动全市干部进行学习，在三月十九日上午召开科以上党员干部大会，由市委宣传部长彭柏山同志作关于“学习悼念斯大林同志文件的几个问题”的报告，对这次学习的目的、主要内容和方法以及斯大林同志在理论活动与实际活动上的伟大贡献都作了扼要的系统的说明。
    根据中共上海市委宣传部关于高级组干部必须首先学好的规定，上海市各机关六十八个高级学习组都很认真地在进行学习。郊区区委组织部长杨锐同志因要经常出去检查工作，所以除了参加本小组的讨论外，下区时并参加区里干部的学习。上海市人民政府政法系统的高级学习组，曾有一个时间未坚持学习制度，最近也开会作了检讨，并制订出这次学习的具体计划。许多高级学习组干部都积极阅读参考书，例如“斯大林传略”，毛主席著“斯大林是中国人民的朋友”，陈伯达著“斯大林和中国革命”等文件，许多同志都重新看了一遍。在仔细阅读的基础上，各小组一般都进行了讨论与漫谈，并且已有七个单位的高级学习组对本单位干部作了辅助学习的启发报告。
    上海市的一般干部也都很认真地阅读文件，并进行了讨论。许多干部在讨论中纷纷表示要坚决响应毛主席的号召，化悲痛为力量，以实际行动来悼念斯大林同志。新成区合作社和团工委有的干部把斯大林同志毕生为共产主义事业而奋斗的精神与自己自私自利、闹不团结等缺点相对照，感到十分惭愧，表示一定要克服这些缺点，坚决学习斯大林。卫生局所属第四医院的干部在学习时也表示以后要学习斯大林同志忠于人民的光辉品质，改变过去不细心对待病人的工作态度。
