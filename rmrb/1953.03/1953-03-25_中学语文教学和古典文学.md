Middle School Chinese Language Teaching and Classical Literature
    Yu Pingbo

    I feel that Chinese classical literature should occupy a considerable proportion in middle school Chinese language teaching. The selection of classical literature in the current middle school Chinese textbooks, whether in terms of quantity, quality, or system, is quite insufficient. I myself have not had much experience in middle school Chinese language teaching, so I simply offer the following suggestions based on my personal thoughts.

    Obviously, language teaching should be combined with patriotism. Patriotism is also an emotion. Patriotism is not empty or dogmatic; it should have concrete content. For example, simply saying "I love my motherland" is good in itself, but it lacks concrete, real content if one does not know what is lovable about the motherland. In the process of language teaching, fully developing the advantages of our national literary heritage can be combined with patriotism education. The question is how to fully develop it, and how to combine it well. I believe that to understand how beautiful our national language is, one cannot be separated from its literature. Although the advantages of the language itself can also be developed, literature is the best practical example of the beauty of language. Many things are not easy to explain clearly, but practical examples make them clear.

    Furthermore, historical tradition cannot be cut off, especially since our motherland has such a long history. In such a long period of feudal society, an extremely splendid ancient culture was created (of course, there were also dross). This fact does not allow us to ignore it. Promoting the excellent cultural heritage has a great effect on developing new culture. Therefore, whether from the perspective of promoting patriotism education, or from the perspective of creating a new culture for the people, Chinese classical literature should be given considerable importance in middle school Chinese language teaching.

    If the above view is not very wrong, I have three suggestions on how middle school Chinese textbooks should select classical literature as teaching material: First, it should not be too narrow. This does not mean indiscriminate acceptance without criticism, throwing all the garbage and dross in together. But the selection of materials in the current textbooks is indeed too narrow. The so-called classical literature originally includes both classical and vernacular styles, with the classical style perhaps being slightly more. I think it is possible to select widely with principles. Promoting the people's feelings, expressing the people's suffering, resisting the oppression of the feudal ruling class at that time—these works with popular and revolutionary character should of course be selected first. Even other works with considerable realism and healthy lyrical works can also be selected. Even expressions of the magnificence of the motherland's mountains and rivers, the beauty of flowers and plants...it would not be impossible to select them. This does not mean that it is necessary to select them, only that the standard should not be too narrow. If I may give an example as an analogy, when selecting Bai Juyi's poems, it is not necessary to only select the New Yuefu poems, but also the "Pipa Xing"; when selecting Du Fu's poems from his middle age, it is not necessary to only select "The Ballad of the Army Carts", but also "Měipí Ballad" (here I am not advocating for the selection of those particular poems, merely using them as metaphors). As for the reasons why it should not be too narrow, although I cannot list them all, I will explain them briefly. New culture cannot be too narrow; it must be nurtured from a broad surface. From the viewpoint of patriotism, if we do not have magnificent mountains and rivers and a hundred flowers blooming, how can we recognize the greatness of the motherland and spontaneously develop a feeling of love? We, of course, oppose the national essence viewpoint without principles or criticism, as mentioned above, but this is a completely different matter.

    I also have an idea, which is that the selected materials should not be too short. Greatness does not equal length, and concise and incisive works can still be great. I do not approve of selecting works that are too difficult or lengthy in middle school Chinese textbooks, but some of the classical language selections in the current high school textbooks are really too short. The problem with being too short is that it not only sometimes fails to express the great image of our national classical literature, but it is also not easy to teach well. Simply put, it is harder to teach. Students who are listening to the lectures are left without a beginning or end, and they are not very interested, so they may not learn well. Without citing textbook examples, let me give some short poems as illustrations, such as the two lines of the "Yi River Song" and the seven lines of the "Chil Le Song." Both songs are indeed short and great. Lines like "The sky is vast, the fields are boundless, the wind blows the grass low, and cattle and sheep are seen" are indeed very good; however, in my personal opinion, or perhaps it is just a bias, I feel that they are not easy to teach and it is not easy to make students understand why they are great. I think the teaching materials can select moderately sized articles, and it does not matter if they are slightly longer; concise and incisive ones can also be selected appropriately. Combining long and short ones would be more appropriate. If they are all short, each article has a beginning, and it is not easy to introduce the beginning, and as soon as it is introduced, it is put down again, which is not very economical, whether in terms of teaching or learning.

    The third idea is that it should not be too little. I do not know how the proportion of teaching materials should be allocated to be reasonable. Now, just in terms of the classical literature part: (1) Everyone knows that classical literature is much longer in time than modern literature, about two thousand years compared to thirty years. (2) Modern literature and ancient literature cannot be separated, just as vernacular and classical language cannot be separated. Therefore, if too few classical language works are selected, like the current textbook, not only will students not be able to understand what classical literature is, but they will also not be able to understand the relationship between ancient and modern literature; in this way, the due mission of language teaching cannot be completed. Below, I will briefly discuss the relationship between the "classical language" and "vernacular" styles.

    From the perspective of historical development, Chinese literature has indeed been gradually moving towards the vernacular. The so-called classical language is not without change; it also progresses with the times. However, the classical language has its own specific rules and is written on paper, so it changes less and more slowly than spoken language. I will not talk about distant works such as the Shangshu and Zuo Zhuan. The articles of the Six Dynasties are said to be ornate and piled up, but in fact, they are more fluent and beautiful than the articles of the Han Dynasties and represent much progress. The "ancient prose" promoted by Han Yu and others, though nominally reviving the ancient, actually adopted contemporary popular writing styles and legendary novels, creating a new style to oppose the old style of the Six Dynasties. Therefore, it is said that he "revived the decline of the eight dynasties in literature." The "ancient prose" style is much clearer and more understandable than parallel prose, sweeping away the so-called rhetoric, allusions, antithesis, etc., and paving the way for vernacular writing. The adoption of vernacular or purely vernacular language in Ci poetry, operas, and novels is naturally not a problem. The essays of the Ming Dynasty have not been discussed much recently, but in fact, they are also a new type of classical language. Using them to express emotions and describe scenery has advantages over parallel prose and ancient prose; I think this should also be affirmed. In terms of novels, vernacular novels such as Water Margin and Dream of the Red Chamber are certainly very good, and some of the writing in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio is even more vivid and expressive than the legends of the Tang Dynasty. The literati of the late Qing Dynasty also made various attempts at new classical language and new writing styles, achieving considerable success. Therefore, the "May Fourth" vernacular movement did not arise out of thin air, relying on the fantasies in the minds of a few literati to flourish across the country. It was actually a great step forward, inheriting thousands of years of historical development.

    The above remarks may seem a bit off-topic. However, I want to use this to illustrate that if the classical language part of classical literature is shrunk into a point, attached to the back of modern literature in isolation, how can this vast and mighty flow of articles be expressed, and how can this constant struggle and constantly developing literary revolution be expressed? Therefore, even if not looking at it from the perspective of classical literature itself, but from the perspective of modern literature and creating new literature, such a small selection of materials is also very inappropriate.

    The above remarks are just my honest thoughts, which may give the reader a wrong feeling (probably it is natural), which is that I am advocating for the selection of a lot of ancient literature as teaching material for middle school Chinese textbooks. However, that is not what I mean. I just think that it should be wider, longer, and more than the current textbooks. I hope that there will be a more lively and energetic, and more complete and appropriate middle school Chinese textbook to make teaching and learning better and greatly promote the spirit of patriotism education.

    中学语文教学和古典文学
    俞平伯
    我觉得中国的古典文学在中学语文教学里应该占相当的比重，像现行的中学语文课本，古典文学部分的编选，不论在量上、质上、系统上都嫌很不够。我自己对于中学的语文教学不曾有过很多的经验，依个人所想到的简单地贡献下列的意见。
    很明显的，语文教学应该和爱国主义相结合。爱国也是一种情感。爱国主义不是空泛的、教条的，应有它具体的内容。譬如空空地说，“我爱祖国”，若不知祖国到底有什么可爱的，这句话本身虽是好的，但却缺少了具体、真实的内容。在语文教学的进行中，把本国文学遗产的优点充分发挥出来，这就可以跟爱国主义的教育相结合了。问题在怎样才能够充分发挥，怎样才能够很好地结合。我以为要了解本国语文的如何优美，离不开它的文学。虽然语言文字的本身优点，也尽可以发挥；文学却是语文优美的最好的实际范例。有许多话不容易说得明白的，但举了实际的例子自然就明白了。
    再说，历史传统是不能切断的，况且我们祖国有这样长久的历史。在这样长期的封建社会里曾创造了十分灿烂的古代文化（当然也有糟粕），这个事实不容许我们忽略。发扬优秀的文化遗产，对发展新的文化有很大的作用。所以不论从发扬爱国主义的教育这角度来看，或从创造人民的新文化这角度来看，中国古典文学在中学的语文教学里都应受到相当的重视。
    假如上面的观点不很错的话，中学语文课本如何选用古典文学作教材，我有三点意见：第一，不宜太狭。这并非无批判地兼容并蓄，把那些垃圾糟粕一起弄进去。但像现行课本这样选材实在太狭了。所谓古典文学原包括文言语体两个部分，文言部分或者稍多一些。我以为不妨有原则性的广泛地选录。发扬人民的感情，申诉人民的痛苦，反抗当时封建统治阶级的压迫，这些有人民性的、革命性的当然应该首先入选。即其他具有相当现实主义成分的和健康的抒情作品也可以选。即如表现祖国山河的壮阔，花草的美丽……也未始不可选。这并不是说必须要选，只表示标准不宜过狭罢了。如许我举例作譬喻来讲，选白居易诗，不一定光选新乐府，即琵琶行也可以选；选杜甫中年的诗，不一定光选兵车行，即渼陂行也可以选（在这里我并不主张要选那几篇，仅仅作为比喻）。至于不能过狭的理由，虽不能备举，也稍为说明一下。新的文化不能过于狭小，须从广大的面上孕育出来。从爱国这观点上看，若非锦绣山河，百花齐放，我们怎么能够认识祖国的伟大，油然发生热爱的心情呢。上面已说过无原则、无批判的国粹观点，我们当然反对；但这完全另是一回事。
    我还有一个想法，就是所选材料不宜过短。伟大原不等于长，短小精悍之作也无妨它的伟大。我并不赞成在中学语文课本里选过于艰深、冗长的作品，但像现在高中的课本，文言部分所选，有些篇幅实在太短。太短的毛病，不仅有时不能表现本国古典文学伟大的形象，而且教学方面也不易搞得好。简单说来，就是更不好教。听讲的学生，没头没脑的，更不大感兴味，所以也未必好学。不引课本为例，任举些短诗来说明，如“易水歌”两句，“敕勒歌”七句，两歌确是很短而伟大的。像“天苍苍，野茫茫，风吹草低见牛羊”，的确很好；不过依我个人的见解，或者竟是偏见，觉得不大好教，不容易使学生了解这所以伟大来。我认为教材，可以选篇幅适中的，稍长一些也不要紧，短小精悍的也可以酌选；长的短的配合起来，这样比较合式。若净是些短的，一篇有一个头绪，头绪本不容易引，才引出来便又放下，无论在教的方面，在学的方面，都不很经济。
    第三个想法，就是不宜太少。我不知道教材的比例上应该怎样分配，方才合理。现在光就古典文学部分来说：（1）人人都知古典文学在时间上比现代文学长得太多了，约两千年和三十年之比。（2）现代文学跟古代文学是不能切开来看的，即白话跟文言也是如此。所以古典文学文言作品，如选得太少了，像现行课本的样子，非但使学生不能了解古典文学是什么，也不能了解古代文学和现代文学的关系是什么；这样子就不能完成语文教学应有的使命。下边就“文言”和“白话”两体的关系稍为一谈。
    从历史的发展看来，中国的文学确实渐渐地在那边走向白话。所谓文言并非没有变动，也随着时代进展；不过文言自有一定的法则，又写在纸上，比口语变化要少一些，缓慢一些罢了。太远的如尚书、左传不去讲它。六朝的文章名说骈俪堆砌，实际上比两汉文章流畅优美，进步得多。韩愈他们所提倡的“古文”，名说复古实兼采当时通俗文字传奇小说，创为新体，来反对六朝旧体，所以人说他“文起八代之衰”。“古文”这一体，总比骈文明白晓畅得多，一扫所谓词藻典故对仗等等，实为白话文开辟道路。若词曲小说采用白话或纯用白话，自然更不成问题。明代的小品文，最近不大有人谈，事实上也是一种新式的文言文。拿来抒情写景比骈文古文另有一种长处；我想这也是应该肯定的。以小说而论，白话小说如水浒、红楼固然很好，即聊斋志异有些文字实比唐人传奇尤能活跃传神。晚清的文人，对新的文言、新的文体也有种种的尝试，得到相当的成功。所以“五四”的白话文运动，决非凭空起来，仗着几个文人脑子里的幻想便能够蓬蓬勃勃风行全国，实是上承几千年历史的发展，而大大地推进了一步罢了。
    上面的话，或嫌离题稍远。不过我想借此说明，假如把古典文学的文言部分紧缩成一个点儿，孤孤另另附在现代文学的后面，如何能表现这个浩浩荡荡的文章流变来，又如何能表现这不断地斗争，不断地发展的文学革命来。所以即不从古典文学本身来看，改从现代文学、开创新的文学这角度来看，这样过少选材也非常的不妥当。
    上边的话，不过就我想到的老实地说出来，可能使读者发生一种错误的感觉（恐怕是当然的），就是我在这里主张多多地、大量地选古代文学作中学语文课本的教材。我的意思却并不是这样。不过认为比现行的课本，选得要宽一些、长一些、多一些罢了。我希望有一个更活泼有生气，亦比较完善妥当的中学语文课本出来使教学两方面进行得更好，大大发扬爱国主义教育的精神。
