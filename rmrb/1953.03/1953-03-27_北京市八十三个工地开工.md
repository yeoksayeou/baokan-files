    【Report from this newspaper】 Cross-year projects in Beijing have successively commenced. As of the 25th of this month, the various construction companies under the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau have started work on eighty-three construction sites, covering a building area of 192,000 square meters. The number of workers participating in the work has reached 23,500. In the next three to five days, it is estimated that construction will commence on another 100,000 square meters of area. Among these projects that have already commenced or are about to commence, many were not originally included in the March commencement plan. After a period of active and intensive preparation recently, these projects, which were temporarily unable to commence, have now met the conditions for commencement. However, there are still individual cross-year projects that, despite subjective efforts, cannot be commenced temporarily. For example, the North Latitude Road Hotel project is fully prepared, but due to the need to build sewers on the site, it is estimated that it will not be able to commence for two months. Another example is the Tongren Hospital project, which was originally planned with a construction cost of 20 billion yuan, but after the design was completed, the preliminary estimate turned into 40 billion yuan. It is now being redesigned, resulting in a suspension of work pending new designs. Yet another example is the student dormitory No. 1 of the Normal University. Last year, construction began using typical drawings without adequate exploration, and as a result, it was discovered that the site was originally a kiln site with many broken bricks and millstones. Good soil was only found below four meters. After the problem occurred, the design department failed to promptly provide opinions on changing the foundation design, so construction cannot proceed temporarily.
    According to a survey and statistics on the 25th, the various construction companies under the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau currently have 30,000 workers, and 23,500 of them have already participated in the work. Only 6,500 workers are temporarily not working. They are all skilled workers, and the reason for not working is mainly due to the lack of unskilled workers to cooperate. If unskilled workers are available, they can immediately be put to work on the construction site. The various construction companies under the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau originally planned to commence construction on 400,000 square meters in March, but the actual commencement is still less than 200,000 square meters. However, the vast majority of workers have already started working. If construction continues to commence, there will be a shortage of workers. In April, the various construction companies in Beijing will have another 400,000 to 500,000 square meters of projects commencing successively. Therefore, there will be an even greater shortage of manpower in the future. For this reason, the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau has recently issued a notice to reserve workers to come to Beijing to work.

### 北京市八十三个工地开工

    北京市八十三个工地开工
    【本报讯】北京市跨年度工程已陆续开工。截至本月二十五日止，北京市建筑工程局所属各工程公司，已有八十三个工地、十九万二千平方公尺建筑面积开工，参加作业的工人达两万三千五百名，在今后三、五天中，估计还将有十多万平方公尺面积工程陆续开工。在这些已经开工或即将开工的工程中，有很多都是原来没有列入三月份开工计划之内的，经过最近一个时期积极紧张的准备后，使这些暂时不能开工的工程都具备了开工的条件。但是，还有个别跨年度工程，虽经主观努力，暂时还不能开工。如北纬路旅馆工程，一切都准备好了，但因工地要修下水道，估计在两月后才能开工；又如同仁医院工程原计划为两百亿元造价，可是设计后经过初步估算变成了四百亿元，现在正重新设计，形成停工待图；再如师范大学第一部学生宿舍，在去年未经很好勘探就用典型图施工，结果发现该工地原是一个窑场，碎砖、盘石很多，在四公尺以下才有好土，问题发生后，设计部门又未及时提出改变基础设计的意见，因而暂时还不能施工。
    据二十五日调查统计，北京市建筑工程局所属各工程公司，现在共有三万工人，参加作业的已达二万三千五百人，暂时还没有上工的工人只有六千五百人。他们全是技术工人，未上工的原因主要是没有杂工配合，如果一旦有了杂工，就可立即投入工地。北京市建筑工程局所属各工程公司原计划三月份开工四十万平方公尺，现在开工的还未到二十万平方公尺，但工人已绝大部分上工了，如果再继续开工，就感到工人不够，在四月份北京各建筑工程公司还将有四十到五十万平方公尺工程陆续开工，因此将来更加感到力量不够。为此，北京市建筑工程局已于最近通知预约工来京上工。
