Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 23rd. On March 20th, at 3:20 AM, the U.S. side killed another of our captured personnel on Geoje Island. The excuse announced by the U.S. side was that several prisoners of war "left the prisoners of war assembled outside their barracks," and therefore they were shot. However, the U.S. side's communique dared not explain what they were doing assembling the prisoners of war in the middle of the night.

On March 19th, two other prisoners of war were wounded on Geoje Island. The reason announced by the U.S. side was "because these prisoners of war refused to obey the order to remain in place after demonstrating in a camp." The U.S. side similarly did not explain why the prisoners of war were "demonstrating" or why they were ordered to "remain in place."

On the same day, the U.S. side again used poison gas to attack 8,000 of our captured personnel on Yongcho Island, on the grounds that the prisoners of war "wanted to carry out" a "riot." The extent of prisoner casualties was not disclosed. On March 7th and March 16th, the U.S. side also carried out bloody massacres and barbaric attacks on the prisoners of war on this island.

Sources here point out that it can be clearly seen from all these events that the U.S. side's method of treating prisoners of war is that anyone can shoot unarmed prisoners of war under any excuse, while these murderers want the world to believe that they are protectors of the prisoners of war's "individual rights." The recent series of incidents in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps proves that the U.S. side is implementing some kind of large-scale measure to detain prisoners of war.

    美方又打死打伤战俘三名
    继续用毒气进攻战俘
    【新华社开城二十三日电】三月二十日早上三时二十分，美方在巨济岛又打死我方被俘人员一名。美方宣布的藉口是有几名战俘“离开在他们的营房外集合的战俘”，因此他们遭到了枪击。但是美方的公报中不敢说明他们半夜三更把战俘集合起来干些什么。
    三月十九日，巨济岛上另有两名战俘被打伤。美方宣布的理由是“因为这些战俘在一个营场中示威之后，拒绝服从留在原地的命令”。战俘为什么“示威”，要他们“留在原地”干什么，美方同样没有说明。
    在同一天，美方又在龙草岛用毒气进攻八千名我方被俘人员，理由是战俘们“想要进行”“暴动”。战俘死伤的情形没有透露。三月七日和三月十六日，美方也曾对这个岛上的战俘进行过血腥屠杀和野蛮进攻。
    此间人士指出，从所有这些事件可以清楚地看出，美方对待战俘的办法，是任何人在任何藉口下都可以对赤手空拳的战俘开枪射击，而这些杀人犯却要全世界相信他们是战俘“个人权利”的保护者。最近在美方战俘营中发生的一连串事件，证明美方正在实施某种大规模扣留战俘的步骤。
