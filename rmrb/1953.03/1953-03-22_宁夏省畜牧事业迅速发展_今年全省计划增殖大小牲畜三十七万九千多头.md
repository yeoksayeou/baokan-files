Ningxia Province's animal husbandry is developing rapidly. The province's five major livestock types—cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, and camels—increased by 9.45 percent last year, while goats and sheep increased by 29.8 percent.

The rapid recovery and development of livestock production have greatly increased the economic income of herdsmen. For example, the livestock income of Village One, Fifth Township, First District, Yanchi County, was only 17.48 million yuan in 1950, increased to 33.55 million yuan in 1951, and is estimated to reach 55.79 million yuan in 1952.

The reason for the Ningxia Province's excellent achievements in animal husbandry is mainly due to the provincial People's Government's correct implementation of livestock policies. Animal husbandry is an important production undertaking for farmers in Ningxia Province, accounting for more than 32 percent of the province's national economy. In order to promote the development of animal husbandry production, the Ningxia Provincial People's Government, in addition to resolutely implementing the policy of protecting animal husbandry during the land reform process, issuing large amounts of livestock loans, and finding normal sales channels for livestock products, also carried out work to improve the relationship between sheep owners and sheep herders. During this work, most districts and villages in various counties held symposiums for sheep herders and livestock owners. Through the symposiums, the relationship between employers and employees was improved, the wages of sheep herders were appropriately adjusted, and the enthusiasm of sheep herders was greatly enhanced. After Zeng Shangwen, a sheep owner in the Second Township of Taole County, improved the treatment of sheep herder Liu Chang, the sheep herder was particularly careful when herding sheep. When ewes lambed in winter, Liu Chang stayed up all night to guard the flock. The breeding survival rate of the sheep flock he managed that year reached 96.7 percent.

Under the People's Government's implementation of policies to protect animal husbandry, the herdsmen in Ningxia Province have improved their livestock feeding and management. In 1952, the People's Government planned to organize the people in pastoral areas to enclose 10,885 square li of grassland and promoted the cultivation of more than 15,000 mu of pasture. Last autumn, the masses carried out work such as storing winter fodder, building pens, opening up water sources, adding tools, and preventing animal pests. Many herdsmen also formulated patriotic pledges based on specific conditions, incorporating specific methods of raising livestock, epidemic prevention, and fodder preparation into the pledges.

With the assistance of veterinary personnel from the People's Government, the masses in the pastoral areas of Ningxia Province have organized to participate in livestock epidemic prevention and control. In 1952, a total of 3,637 township and village cadres and herdsmen in the province participated in epidemic prevention training. Through this training, they learned how to report epidemics and, after discovering epidemics, carry out isolation, blockade, disinfection, and carcass disposal, and also initially mastered the prevention and control techniques for several major internal and external parasites.

According to the Central People's Government's policy of vigorously developing animal husbandry, Ningxia Province plans to increase various large livestock by more than 29,000 head and increase goats and sheep by 350,000 in 1953. In order to ensure the completion of the growth task, in addition to continuing to strengthen leadership over this work, the province is also preparing to cultivate 12 high-yield townships, 28 high-yield villages, and 43 high-yield groups in a planned way. The province will use these high-yield banners to drive the province's livestock increasing movement. (Cui Xiangkai)

    宁夏省畜牧事业迅速发展
    今年全省计划增殖大小牲畜三十七万九千多头
    宁夏省的畜牧事业，正在迅速地发展着。全省牛、马、驴、骡、骆驼五种大家畜，去年共增加了百分之九点四五，山羊和绵羊增加了百分之二十九点八。
    牲畜生产的迅速恢复和发展，大大地增进了牧民的经济收益。例如：盐池县一区五乡一村在一九五○年畜产收入仅一千七百四十八万元，一九五一年增到三千三百五十五万元，据估计一九五二年畜产收入能达到五千五百七十九万元。
    宁夏省畜牧事业所以能有这样良好的成就，主要原因是省人民政府正确地贯彻了畜牧政策。畜牧业是宁夏省农民的重要生产事业，约占全省国民经济的百分之三十二以上。宁夏省人民政府为了促进畜牧业生产的发展，除了在土地改革过程中坚决贯彻了保护畜牧业的政策，发放很大数额的畜牧业贷款和为畜产品找到正常的销路外，并且进行了改善羊主和羊工关系的工作。在进行这项工作中，各县的大部区、村都召开了羊工和牧主的座谈会。通过座谈会，改善了主雇的关系，适当地调整了羊工的工资，羊工的积极性大大提高了。陶乐县二乡羊主曾尚文提高了羊工刘长的待遇以后，羊工在放羊时特别小心谨慎。刘长在冬季母羊下羔时，为了看守羊群整夜不睡觉。这年他所经管的羊群的繁殖成活率高达百分之九十六点七。
    在人民政府贯彻执行保护畜牧业的政策下，宁夏省的牧民改善了对牲畜的饲养管理工作。一九五二年人民政府有计划地组织牧区人民封闭草原一万零八百八十五平方华里；提倡栽培牧草一万五千余亩。在去年秋季，群众进行了贮备冬需草料，修建圈棚，开辟水源，添置用具，防止兽害等工作。许多牧民还根据具体情况，订立了爱国公约，把饲养牲畜的具体方法、防疫、备草料等都订在公约里。
    宁夏省牧区群众在人民政府兽医人员的协助下，有组织地参加了畜疫防治工作。一九五二年全省共有乡、村干部和牧民三千六百三十七人参加了防疫训练。通过这种训练，他们学会了报告疫情和发现疫情后进行隔离、封锁、消毒、毁尸等办法，同时也初步掌握了几种主要内外寄生虫的防治技术。
    根据中央人民政府大力发展畜牧事业的方针，一九五三年宁夏省计划增殖各种大家畜二万九千多头，增殖山羊、绵羊三十五万只。为保证增殖任务的完成，该省除了继续加强对这一工作的领导外，还准备有计划地培养丰产乡十二个、丰产村二十八个和丰产组四十三个。通过这些丰产旗帜来带动全省的增畜运动。（崔祥凯）
