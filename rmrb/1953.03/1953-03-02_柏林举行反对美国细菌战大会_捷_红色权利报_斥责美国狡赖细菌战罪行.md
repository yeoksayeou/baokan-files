Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 26th (Delayed Dispatch): Under the auspices of the National Front Aid Korea Committee of the German Democratic Republic and the German Peace Committee, Berlin held a protest rally against US germ warfare on the 25th. The rally was held at the Friedrichstadt-Palast, Berlin's largest theater, with several thousand people in attendance. The slogans of the rally were: "Peace for Korea!" "Down with the criminal germ warfare!" "Down with the American warmongers!"

Professor Linse, Chairman of the German Aid Korea Committee, delivered the first speech, saying: "As a scientist and doctor, I call on everyone to fight for the prohibition of germ warfare and to stop germ warfare in Korea. During the United Nations General Assembly's debate on germ warfare, people of all countries must declare that they can no longer tolerate this inhuman crime."

Then, Professor Bai Xiqing, head of the Chinese delegation in charge of the "Exhibition of Crimes of Germ Warfare by the US Government," spoke, describing the heroic struggle of the people of Korea and China against US germ warfare and calling on scientists of all countries to stop the US government from using science as a weapon to slaughter mankind. Bai Xiqing pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly, currently meeting in New York, should take immediate action to condemn and stop the US government's brutal crime of using bacteriological weapons.

Heinz Willmann, Secretary-General of the German Peace Committee and member of the World Peace Council, said: No one can deny that the US imperialists have carried out germ warfare in Korea and China. We Germans especially have reason to be vigilant. What is happening today in Korea and Northeast China may happen in Germany tomorrow. And I want to say: It seems that this has already happened. According to all indications, typhus is spreading near Stuttgart in West Germany, due to carelessness in the American laboratories preparing for germ warfare in Europe.

Else Thiele, Secretary of the German Democratic Women's League, called on all women and mothers to commemorate International Women's Day on March 8 as a day of action to fight for the freedom and happiness of the Korean people. Leopold Stiedl, Minister of Health of the German Democratic Republic, and a housewife from West Berlin who came to visit the "Exhibition of Crimes of Germ Warfare by the US Government" also delivered speeches at the meeting.

The attendees of the meeting unanimously passed a resolution to the United Nations: "Down with the criminal germ warfare of the US aggressors." The resolution said: "All those who participated in the anti-US germ warfare protest rally held at the Friedrichstadt-Palast in Berlin on February 25, 1953, at the invitation of the German Aid Korea Committee and the German Peace Committee, express their indignation at the inhuman and criminal atrocities of the US aggressors in the Korean War."

The resolution pointed out: Regarding the fact that the United States is conducting germ warfare, local residents and American officers and soldiers have provided many testimonies and records. The confessions of Colonel Frank H. Schwable, Chief of Staff, and Major Roy H. Bley, Ordnance Officer, two senior officers of the 1st Marine Air Wing, have just been published, and their confessions fully confirm the US crime of conducting germ warfare.

The resolution emphasized, "We unreservedly support the demand of the World People's Peace Congress for the immediate prohibition of germ warfare and recognition of the Geneva Protocol.

"If the Bonn and Paris treaties are realized, what is happening today in Korea and Northeast China will happen in Europe tomorrow. We call on all the German people and the people of the world to join us in fighting against the US aggressors and saving mankind."

The resolution finally called: "Stop the crime of germ warfare in Korea! Stop the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya! Stop the war preparations in Europe, abolish the European Defense Community and the General Treaty! More forcefully support Korea and all threatened people! Strive for mutual understanding and peace among all people!"

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 28th: "Red Rights" newspaper published a commentary on the 27th saying: Comparing the confessions of Frank H. Schwable and Roy H. Bley—two US Marine Corps officers—with the previously published statements of captured American pilots, it is clear to see the entire plan and organization of US germ warfare, as well as its purpose and function.

The commentary wrote: These very convincing confessions, as well as the reports published by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, the International Scientific Commission, and many prominent peace fighters, leave no room for doubt about the US government's use of bacteriological weapons.

The US government wants to turn Korea into a large-scale germ experiment laboratory, from which to obtain the experience necessary for conducting this criminal war, in order to destroy other countries in the future.

"Therefore, the US ruling class is attempting to conceal this anti-human crime with silence, denial, lies, and slander. They are attempting to cover themselves with the blue and white flag of the United Nations."

The commentary concluded by saying that the US use of bacteriological weapons had already been denounced in the last session of the United Nations General Assembly, and now that the United Nations General Assembly is meeting again, "The voices of hundreds of millions of people around the world demanding an end to military action in Korea, an end to the use of germ warfare, and ratification of the Geneva Protocol are growing stronger and stronger," and the United States must give an answer.

    柏林举行反对美国细菌战大会
    捷“红色权利报”斥责美国狡赖细菌战罪行
    【新华社柏林二月二十六日电】（迟到）：在民主德国全国阵线援朝委员会与德国和平委员会的主持下，柏林于二十五日举行反对美国细菌战的抗议大会。大会在柏林最大的剧院腓特烈宫举行，参加的有好几千人。大会的口号是：“给朝鲜和平！”“打倒罪恶的细菌战！”“打倒美国战争贩子！”
    德国援朝委员会主席林塞教授首先致词说：“我以一个科学家与医生的身份，号召所有的人为禁止细菌战争和制止在朝鲜进行细菌战而斗争。在联合国大会就要举行的关于细菌战的辩论的期间，各国人民都必须宣布，他们再也不能容忍这种不人道的罪行。”
    接着负责展出“美国政府细菌战罪行展览会”的中国代表团团长白希清教授发言，叙述朝中两国人民反对美国细菌战的英勇斗争并呼吁各国科学家制止美国政府利用科学来作为屠杀人类的武器。白希清指出：正在纽约开会的联合国大会应立即采取行动，谴责和制止美国政府使用细菌武器的残暴罪行。
    德国和平委员会总书记、世界和平理事会理事海恩茨·卫尔曼说：谁也无法否认美帝国主义者在朝鲜与中国进行了细菌战。我们德国人尤其有理由要提高警惕。今天在朝鲜与中国东北发生的事情明天就可能在德国发生。而且我要说：现在显然已发生了这种事情。根据一切迹象看来，西德斯图加特近郊正流行着斑疹伤寒，这是由于正在欧洲准备细菌战的美国实验室工作不小心所造成的。
    德国民主妇女联合会书记处书记艾尔斯·蒂勒号召所有的妇女与母亲把三八国际妇女节当作争取朝鲜人民自由与幸福的行动日来纪念。德意志民主共和国卫生部长路易波德·史泰德尔和前来参观“美国政府细菌战罪行展览会”的西柏林的一位主妇在会上也发表了演说。
    出席大会人士一致通过了致联合国的决议：“打倒美国侵略者的罪恶细菌战”。决议说：“应德国援朝委员会和德国和平委员会的邀请参加一九五三年二月二十五日在柏林腓特烈宫举行的反对美国细菌战抗议大会的所有人士，对于美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中的惨无人道的罪恶暴行表示愤慨。”
    决议指出：关于美国进行细菌战的事实，当地居民和美国官兵提供了许多证词和纪录。美国海军陆战队第一空军联队的两名高级军官参谋长许威布尔上校和军械官布莱少校的供词刚刚公布不久，他们的供词完全证实了美国进行细菌战的罪行。
    决议着重地说，“我们毫无保留地支持世界人民和平大会关于立刻禁止细菌战并承认日内瓦议定书的要求。
    “假如波恩和巴黎条约实现的话，今天在朝鲜和中国东北部发生的事情明天就会在欧洲发生。我们要求全体德国人民和全世界人民与我们共同进行斗争来反对美国侵略者并拯救人类。”
    决议最后号召：“停止在朝鲜进行的细菌战罪行！停止朝鲜、越南和马来亚的战争！停止在欧洲备战，取消欧洲防务集团和一般性条约！更加有力地支援朝鲜和所有受威胁的人民！争取所有人民为互相谅解与和平而奋斗！”
    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】“红色权利报”二十七日发表评论说：把弗兰克·赫·许威布尔和罗伊·赫·布莱——两个美国海军陆战队军官——的供词和以前发表的被俘的美国驾驶员的口供对照起来看，可以清楚地看出美国细菌战的整个计划和组织以及它的目的和作用。
    评论写道：这些很有说服力的口供，以及国际民主法律工作者协会、国际科学委员会，和许多著名和平战士所发表的报告，使人们对美国政府的使用细菌武器这件事不能有丝毫的怀疑。
    美国政府想把朝鲜变成一个大规模的细菌实验所，从那里得到进行这种罪恶战争所必需的经验，以便将来毁灭其他国家。
    “因此，美国统治阶级企图用沉默、抵赖、谎话和诽谤来掩饰他们这种反人类的罪行。他们企图用联合国的蓝白旗来遮盖他们。”
    评论最后说，在联合国大会的上次会议中，已经有人斥责美国使用细菌武器，现在联合国大会又开会了，“全世界千百万人民要求停止朝鲜的军事行动、停止使用细菌战和批准日内瓦议定书的呼声愈来愈强大”，美国必须给予答复。
