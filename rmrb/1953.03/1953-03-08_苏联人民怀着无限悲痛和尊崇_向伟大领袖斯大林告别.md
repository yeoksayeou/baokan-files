Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 7th: According to TASS, Moscow, the Soviet capital, is immersed in deep sorrow. All buildings are flying flags at half-mast, edged with black.

	At 4:00 PM on the 6th, an endless stream of people began to enter the Hall of Columns of the House of Trade Unions. People from the Soviet capital and representatives from other cities came here to bid farewell to their brilliant leader, friend, and teacher, J.V. Stalin.

	The crystal chandeliers in the Hall of Columns were draped with black gauze. Velvet curtains hung from the ceiling to the ground, bearing the national emblems of the sixteen Soviet republics.

	In the center of the hall, on a high platform amidst palms and flowers, lay the remains of this great man – whose great name will forever live in the hearts of the Soviet people and all progressive humanity.

	On the drooping flags were the battle cries: "Workers of all countries, unite!"

	At the foot of the coffin, on a red silk cushion, lay the medals, representing the homeland's supreme evaluation of Stalin's glorious activities as a comrade-in-arms of Lenin and the great successor to Lenin's cause.

	The hall was filled with wreaths. At the foot of the coffin lay a large wreath inscribed: "Respectfully dedicated to the leader and teacher of the Communist Party and the Soviet people, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union." Beside it were wreaths presented by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the Moscow Regional Committee and the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, and Stalin's relatives and friends.

	At 4:00 PM, the Hall of Columns opened. Countless people came to the hall to bid a final farewell to their departed leader.

	Standing guard of honor before the coffin of J.V. Stalin were his comrades-in-arms during his lifetime—members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and leaders of the Soviet government: Malenkov, Beria, Molotov, Voroshilov, Khrushchev, Bulganin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, and Shvernik.

	The orchestra continuously played mournful music by Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Chopin, and Gluck. People walked past the coffin of Comrade J.V. Stalin in a sorrowful and solemn mood. Among them were machinists from the Stalin factory, textile workers from the Three Hills Textile Mill, scientists, soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy, Moscow elementary school students, and collective farmers from the Moscow region.

	Moscow, the motherland, and all progressive humanity are bidding farewell to Comrade Stalin.

	The eyes of those who came to this hall were filled with deep love and respect for their departed leader.

	They stared intently at the face of their beloved Stalin, in order to forever imprint it in their hearts. In these sorrowful days, the Soviet people, with immense grief, have come to understand with exceptional clarity the need to unite more closely around the Leninist-Stalinist Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government, and they are fully determined to devote all their strength to the cause for which their departed leader and teacher struggled all his life.

	Dozens of delegations of citizens of the capital entered the hall and laid wreaths before the leader's coffin.

	The guard of honor rotated every five minutes.

	Now on guard are M.Z. Saburov, M.G. Pervukhin, M.A. Suslov, N.A. Mikhailov, P.K. Ponomarenko, S.D. Ignatiev, P.N. Pospelov, N.N. Shatalin, and M.F. Shkiryatov. Following them are representatives of the Moscow Party organization, leaders of the Moscow Regional Committee and the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

	Several Marshals of the Soviet Union: Vasilevsky, Sokolovsky, Budyonny, Govorov, Konev, and Timoshenko, stood guard before the remains of the greatest commander of all time. It was under the leadership of this commander that the Soviet Union achieved the greatest victory in history over fascism in the Second World War.

	All night long, until late, an endless stream of people continued to flow into the Hall of Columns.

    苏联人民怀着无限悲痛和尊崇
    向伟大领袖斯大林告别
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：苏联首都莫斯科浸沉在深沉的悲哀中。一切建筑物都下半旗，旗上镶着黑边。
    六日下午四时，无穷无尽的人流开始进入工会大厦圆柱大厅。苏联首都的人民和其他城市的代表来到这里，向他们的天才领袖、朋友和导师约·维·斯大林告别。
    圆柱大厅的水晶大吊灯上披上了黑纱。天鹅绒的帷幕从天花板垂到地下，上面是十六个苏维埃加盟共和国的国徽。
    大厅中央，在棕榈和鲜花中间的高台上，安置着这位长眠了的伟人——他的伟大名字将永远活在苏联人民和全体进步人类的心里。
    在下垂的大旗上，是战斗的口号：“全世界工人们，联合起来！”
    在灵柩的脚下，红绸垫子上放着勋章，它代表着祖国对列宁的战友和列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林的光辉活动的崇高评价。
    大厅里摆满了花圈。灵柩脚下摆着一个大花圈，上面写着：“谨献给共产党和苏维埃人民的领袖和导师约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林苏联共产党中央委员会”。摆在它旁边的是苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议、苏联共产党莫斯科州委员会和莫斯科市委员会、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会和斯大林的亲友们献的花圈。
    下午四时，圆柱大厅开始开放。无数的人来到大厅，向他们的逝去的领袖作最后的告别。
    在约·维·斯大林灵前守灵的是他生前的战友——苏联共产党中央委员会的委员和苏联政府的领袖马林科夫、贝利亚、莫洛托夫、伏罗希洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、米高扬、什维尔尼克。
    乐队不停地奏着柴可夫斯基、贝多芬、萧邦、格里克的哀乐。人们在悲痛肃穆的情绪中像流水般地走过约·维·斯大林同志的灵前。其中包括斯大林工厂的机械工人、三山纺织厂的纺织工人、科学家、苏联陆海军战士、莫斯科的小学生、莫斯科州的集体农民。
    莫斯科、祖国、全体进步人类都在向斯大林同志告别。
    来到这个大厅的人们，眼里都充满着对于这位逝去的领袖的挚爱和尊崇。
    他们凝神注视亲爱的斯大林的容貌，为的是要永远印在心里。在这悲哀的日子，苏维埃人民怀着巨大的悲痛，格外透彻地了解到需要更加亲密地团结在列宁—斯大林党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围，他们有充分的决心，把全部力量贡献给他们逝去的领袖和导师终身奋斗的事业。
    首都市民的几十个代表团走进大厅，在领袖的灵前献花圈。
    守灵的人每五分钟轮换一次。
    现在守灵的是马·萨·萨布罗夫、米·格·别尔乌辛、米·安·苏斯洛夫、纳·阿·米哈伊洛夫、普·克·波诺马连科、斯·德·伊格纳捷夫、彼·恩·波斯伯洛夫、纳·纳·夏塔林、马·佛·施基利亚托夫。接着是莫斯科党组织的代表，苏联共产党莫斯科州委员会和莫斯科市委员会的领导人。
    苏联的几位元帅：华西列夫斯基、索科洛夫斯基、布琼尼、戈沃罗夫、科涅夫、铁木辛哥，在这位一切时代最伟大的统帅的灵前守灵。就是在这位统帅的领导下，苏联在第二次世界大战中对法西斯主义取得了创造历史的最伟大的胜利。
    整个晚上，直到夜深，无尽的人流，仍在不断地流入圆柱大厅。
