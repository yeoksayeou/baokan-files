Xinhua News Agency, March 25th—To implement Chairman Mao's instruction at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to "go deep into the lower levels, maintain close ties with the masses, and overcome bureaucracy," the departments of the Central People's Government have successively organized work inspection groups and dispatched them to various parts of the country to conduct in-depth inspections of the work of their subordinate units.

The departments of the People's Government that have recently dispatched inspection groups to inspect work include the Supreme People's Court, the Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Ministry of Higher Education, totaling over a hundred inspection groups. More than a thousand cadres at the ministerial, vice-ministerial, and director/section/division levels are participating in the inspection work, with inspection periods generally ranging from half a month to two months. The inspection groups made full preparations before departure. Personnel from each unit participating in the inspection work studied relevant policies and business operations and focused on researching inspection methods.

This inspection work is aimed at addressing problems that have arisen in the work and closely combined with the central work of the unit. For example, the six inspection groups of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, led by Minister Zhu Xuefan, went to various places to focus on inspecting the work of grassroots post and telecommunications bureaus and the existing problems. The thirteen inspection groups of the Central Ministry of Labor, led by Minister Li Lisan and Vice Minister Mao Qihua, went to Central-South, Northeast, and other places to inspect the unified allocation of construction workers and workers' welfare issues. The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry mobilized more than two hundred and fifty cadres to form thirteen inspection groups, which went to five key areas, including Anshan, Fushun, Shandong, and Yunnan, to focus on inspecting the preparatory work for basic construction. The fourteen inspection groups of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, led by Vice Ministers Liu Lanbo and Xu Daben, went to Central-South, East China, and other places to inspect coal mine industry exploration and new well projects in the petroleum industry. The inspection groups of the Central Ministry of Water Resources, led by Vice Ministers Li Baohua, Zhang Hanying, and Qian Zhengying, went to the Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River in Hebei, the Huai River Basin, and the Hunkhe River Dahuofang Reservoir construction site in the Northeast to inspect the local engineering plans and progress.

The inspection groups went deep into grassroots units and construction sites to conduct inspections, helping lower-level organs to discover and solve problems in a timely manner, effectively promoting the work. The inspection group of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has initially found that some key basic construction units have serious problems in their preparatory work. For example, the Dongchuan Mining Bureau in Yunnan Province has a large construction task this year, but until the inspection, the bureau's organizational structure was still extremely unsound, and the necessary administrative organs and technical departments had not yet been established. Due to the slow progress of design, the bureau only completed 50% of the planned civil engineering construction in January. Eight of the ten installation projects failed to start on schedule. The inspection group discovered the above problems and has helped the bureau find ways to improve. The five inspection groups of the Supreme People's Court took two hundred and sixty-three cases of appeals, applications for trial representation, and people's reports, and went to Hebei, Tianjin, and other places for on-the-spot trials. After the inspection personnel conducted in-depth investigations among the masses, one hundred and sixty-one cases have been closed. The remaining more complex cases have also grasped more sufficient materials and will be processed after returning.

This inspection work by the central organs is a good start to overcome bureaucratic leadership methods. Many departments have carefully studied the materials obtained from the inspection, and in light of the current problems, they have sought ways to improve the work of the leading organs. After the first batch of inspection groups returned from some units, they prepared to send the second batch of inspection groups to go down, so as to regularly go deep into the lower levels to inspect the work and completely overcome bureaucratic style.

    中央人民政府各部门
    组织千余干部深入下层检查工作
     【新华社二十五日讯】为了执行毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上“深入下层，密切联系群众，克服官僚主义”的指示，中央人民政府各部门相继组织了工作检查组，陆续分赴全国各地，对所属单位的工作进行深入的检查。
    人民政府各部门在最近派遣检查组下去检查工作的有最高人民法院、政法委员会、轻工业部、重工业部、商业部、邮电部、地质部、水利部和高等教育部等部门，共组织检查组一百多个，参加检查工作的有部长、副部长和司、局、处级干部一千多人，检查时间一般为半个月到两个月。检查组在出发前都作了充分的准备。各单位参加检查工作的人员都进行了有关政策和业务的学习，并着重研究了检查工作的方法。
    这次检查工作是针对工作中发生的问题和密切结合当前本单位的中心工作进行的。如中央邮电部的六个检查组，由部长朱学范率领分赴各地着重检查基层邮电局的工作情况和所存在的问题。中央劳动部的十三个检查组，由部长李立三、副部长毛齐华领导分赴中南、东北等地检查建筑工人统一调配和工人福利等问题。中央重工业部调集了二百五十多个干部，组成十三个检查组，分赴鞍山、抚顺、山东、云南等五个重点区着重检查基本建设的准备工作。中央燃料工业部的十四个检查组，由副部长刘澜波、徐达本领导，到中南、华东等地检查煤矿工业的钻探和石油工业的新井工程。中央水利部的检查组，由副部长李葆华、张含英、钱正英率领分赴河北永定河官厅水库、淮河流域和东北浑河大火房水库工地检查当地的工程计划和进展情况。
    这次检查组深入基层单位和现场进行检查，帮助下级机关及时发现了并解决了问题，有效地推进了工作。中央重工业部检查组已初步发现有些重点基本建设单位在准备工作中存在着严重的问题。如云南省东川矿务局今年的建设任务很大，但直到检查时，该局组织机构仍极不健全，必要的行政机构和技术部门尚未建立。由于设计进度迟缓，该局一月份土木建筑工程只完成工程计划的百分之五十。十项安装工程有八项都未能按计划及时开工。检查组发现上述问题，已帮助该局设法改进。最高人民法院的五个检查组，带了二百六十三件上诉、申请代审、人民检举的案件，分赴河北、天津等地就地审判。经检查人员深入群众进行调查，已有一百六十一宗案件结案。其余案情较复杂的案件，也已掌握较充分的材料，回来后再作处理。
    中央机关这次检查工作，是克服官僚主义领导方法的良好开端。许多部门已将检查所得材料，认真研究，针对目前存在的问题，设法改进领导机关的工作。有些单位第一批检查组回来后，又准备派第二批检查组下去，做到经常深入下层，检查工作，彻底克服官僚主义作风。
