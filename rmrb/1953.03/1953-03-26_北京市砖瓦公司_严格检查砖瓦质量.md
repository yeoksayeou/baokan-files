The brick and tile manufacturing work in Beijing has in the past had a serious tendency toward low quality and non-standard specifications. Among the bricks currently stored by the Beijing Brick and Tile Company, more than 22 million are substandard in quality and specifications. More than 200,000 blue bricks from the Second Brick and Tile Factory contain too much sand and gravel and cannot be used for capital construction. Most of the 1.6 million red bricks produced by the Yongjian Brick Factory in 1951 were substandard and have already effloresced, and no one has bought them to this day.

The simple profit-seeking viewpoint and the failure to establish the idea of serving capital construction are the main reasons for the poor quality and substandard specifications of bricks and tiles. More than ninety government agencies producing brick and tile factories, in 1951, due to the heavy task of capital construction in the capital and the huge demand for bricks, took the opportunity to produce crudely and substitute inferior products for good ones, which seriously affected the country's construction.

In February and March of this year, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Local Industry Bureau, the Brick and Tile Company sent out four inspection teams to conduct a general inspection in cooperation with various factories, and graded the existing bricks and tiles. Now, in order to ensure the supply of bricks and tiles for the 1953 capital construction project, the following specific measures have been decided: 1. Convene a meeting of factory directors and production section chiefs of various brick and tile factories to criticize the idea of simply pursuing profit and neglecting the quality of bricks and tiles, and discuss effective ways to improve the quality of bricks and tiles. 2. Mobilize all workers and cadres to launch a mass movement to inspect, guarantee, and improve the quality of bricks and tiles. 3. Formulate合格standard for various bricks and tiles. 4. Establish a strict inspection system for raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products; in the future, bricks and tiles coming out of the kiln should be placed separately according to their grades, and good and bad should not be mixed. 5. Factories with too much slurry stone and soil that cannot guarantee quality should stop production, and would rather have a shortage than produce inferior products. 6. Conduct technical reviews of brick and tile workers, and workers who are not suitable for making brick blanks should be transferred to other jobs. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 北京市砖瓦公司  严格检查砖瓦质量

    北京市砖瓦公司
    严格检查砖瓦质量
    北京市的砖瓦制造工作，过去存在着严重的质量低劣、不合规格的偏向。北京市砖瓦公司现存的砖中，质量和规格不够标准的竟达二千二百多万块。第二砖瓦厂的青砖有二十多万块含砂石太多，无法用于基本建设。永建砖厂在一九五一年生产的一百六十万块红砖，大部分不合规格，并已起碱，至今无人购买。
    单纯营利观点和没有树立起为基本建设服务的思想，是砖瓦质量低劣、规格不够标准的主要原因。全市九十多个机关生产砖瓦厂，在一九五一年，由于首都基本建设任务繁重，需砖数字庞大，它们便乘机粗制滥造，以坏充好，结果严重地影响了国家的建设。
    今年二、三月间，砖瓦公司在北京市人民政府地方工业局领导下，派出四个检查组，配合各厂进行了普遍的检查，并将现存的砖瓦评定了等级。现在，为了保证一九五三年首都基本建设工程的砖瓦供应，决定采取以下具体措施：一、召开各砖瓦厂厂长、生产股股长会议，批判单纯营利、忽视砖瓦质量的思想，讨论出改进砖瓦质量的有效办法。二、发动全体工人、干部，展开群众性的检查、保证和提高砖瓦质量的运动。三、制定各种砖瓦的合格标准。四、建立严格的原料、半成品、产品的检查制度；今后出窑的砖瓦，要分别等级放置，不得好坏混杂。五、浆石土太多无法保证质量的工厂，要停止生产，宁缺毋滥。六、对砖瓦工人进行技术审查，不适合制造砖坯的工人另调其他工作。（据新华社讯）
