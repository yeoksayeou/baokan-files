Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 19th: On March 17th, General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of our side at the Korean Armistice Negotiations, lodged a serious protest with the other side regarding the incident of U.S. military aircraft bombing the Kaesong Neutral Zone on March 13th, injuring three people. General Nam Il pointed out: This incident, following the other side's unilateral interruption of the armistice negotiations, is a new, serious, and deliberate provocative action to further damage the conference area and neutral zone in order to completely destroy the foundation of the Korean armistice negotiations. General Nam Il demanded that the other side provide a fully responsible explanation for this incident promptly. The full text of General Nam Il's protest is as follows:

To Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Delegate of the United Nations Command:

    Around 5:40 AM on March 13th, your military aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone, dropping bombs and bombing the center of Kaesong city, injuring three civilians and destroying multiple houses. On March 14th, liaison officers from both sides conducted a joint investigation into your bombing of the neutral zone. Material evidence and eyewitness accounts both confirm your complete responsibility. I lodge a serious protest with you regarding this extremely serious provocative incident. Your side has consistently disregarded the agreement on the conference area and neutral zone, constantly carrying out provocative actions that violate the agreement. Since your side unilaterally interrupted the armistice negotiations and coerced the Seventh UN General Assembly into passing the illegal resolution on the Korean issue based on the Indian proposal with the aim of detaining prisoners of war, you have intensified your destruction and tearing up of the agreements between the two sides, attempting to completely destroy the armistice negotiations in order to expand the war of aggression against Korea. This bombing of the Kaesong Neutral Zone by your side, following your unilateral interruption of the armistice negotiations on October 8, 1952, is a new, serious, and deliberate provocative action to further damage the conference area and neutral zone in order to completely destroy the foundation of the Korean armistice negotiations. No excuse can conceal the serious nature of your provocative action. Your side must provide a fully responsible explanation for this incident.

    对美机轰炸开城中立区的挑衅行动
    南日将军向美方提出严重抗议
    【新华社开城十九日电】三月十七日，朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军就三月十三日美方军用飞机轰炸开城中立区、打伤三人的事件向对方提出严重抗议。南日将军指出：这次事件是对方片面中断停战谈判之后，进一步破坏会场区和中立区，以彻底摧毁朝鲜停战谈判基础的一个新的严重的蓄意挑衅行动。南日将军要求对方对这次事件迅速作出完全负责的交代。南日将军的抗议全文如下：联合国军首席代表哈利逊中将：
    三月十三日五时四十分左右，你方军用飞机侵入开城中立区上空，向开城市区中心投弹轰炸，打伤市民三人，炸毁房屋多处。三月十四日，双方联络官对你方对中立区的轰炸进行了共同调查，物证和人证都证实了你方的完全责任。对于这一极端严重的挑衅事件，我向你提出严重抗议。你方一贯无视会场区和中立区协议，不断进行破坏协议的挑衅行动，而自从你方片面中断停战谈判，挟制第七届联合国大会根据印度提案通过以扣留战俘为目的的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议以来，你方更变本加厉地破坏与撕毁双方协议，企图彻底破坏停战谈判，以便扩大侵略朝鲜的战争。此次你方轰炸开城中立区，是你方继一九五二年十月八日片面中断停战谈判之后，进一步破坏会场区与中立区以彻底摧毁朝鲜停战谈判基础的一个新的严重的蓄意挑衅行动。任何借口都不能掩饰你方这一挑衅行动的严重性质。你方必须对此次事件作出完全负责的交代。
