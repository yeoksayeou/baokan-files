Telegram of Condolence from the CCP Rehe Provincial Committee to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia:

We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Comrade Klement Gottwald, the great leader of the Czechoslovak people and a dear friend of the Chinese people. On behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China in Rehe Province and all the people, we extend our deepest condolences to the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and all the people.

The unfortunate passing of Comrade Gottwald is not only a great loss and misfortune for the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak people, but also a great loss and misfortune for the world's cause of peace and democracy and the world's communist cause. However, we believe that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and all the Czechoslovak people will certainly inherit Comrade Gottwald's legacy, further strengthen unity, and victoriously advance towards socialism. All members of the Communist Party of China in Rehe Province and all the people will, with redoubled efforts, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, forever unite closely with the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak people, consolidate the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, thwart any conspiracies and tricks of imperialism, and fight to the end to defend peace in Asia and the world.
