Dearest Volunteer Army Comrades:

It feels like only yesterday we left you, but it has already been three months, and not a moment passes without us thinking of you. After returning to China, in order to effectively share your stories of overcoming difficulties, fighting bravely, and achieving great victories alongside the Korean people with our compatriots across the country, the higher authorities decided that our Fourth Sub-group would be responsible for delivering these messages in the East China region. We accepted this task and, under the guidance of the main delegation, first summarized the慰问 (comforting and appreciation) work in Tianjin and made the necessary preparations and pilot tests for the传达 (conveying messages) work. We decided not to rest and, upon entering the East China region, immediately began传达 (conveying messages) in Shandong Province, followed by Anhui Province, Nanjing City, the entire Jiangsu Province, Shanghai City, Zhejiang Province, and Fujian Province, according to the plan.

We traveled all over the east coast of our motherland. We were warmly welcomed and cheered everywhere by the masses. In one hundred and forty-six counties and cities in East China and the two major cities of Shanghai and Nanjing, we delivered a total of one thousand two hundred and forty-one reports to workers, farmers, troops, youth, women, democratic parties, people from cultural and educational circles, industrial and commercial circles, religious circles, and ethnic minorities. According to incomplete statistics, the audience exceeded two million three hundred and sixty thousand people. The number of people who saw the photo exhibitions and listened to the radio broadcasts is still impossible to count; Zhejiang Province alone had over four hundred thousand listeners.

In the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, the people are stepping up efforts to strengthen coastal defense. The armed forces guarding the coastal islands are vigilantly monitoring the ocean, defending the southeastern gateway of our motherland. With a spirit of hard struggle, they are constantly打击 (striking blows against) the remnant bandits who dare to harass us. We have been to those places and not only told them about your heroic fighting spirit but also introduced some of your combat experience to them and extended our sincere慰问 (comforting and appreciation) to them. They unanimously expressed their determination to learn from the Volunteer Army and to protect our sacred and inviolable motherland with their flesh and blood.

The reports, broadcasts, and photo exhibitions we held in various parts of East China have played a significant educational role among the people from all walks of life, inspiring their enthusiasm for work, study, production, and strengthening the抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) work. Yu Dengrun, a labor model from the Puhua Factory in Hangzhou City, felt that his work performance was far behind that of the Volunteer Army after listening to the report. Therefore, he was determined to install a new 400-horsepower generator in January. All the workers of the Yufeng Cloth Factory in Zhangzhou, Fujian, wrote a letter of慰问 (comforting and appreciation) to you, guaranteeing that the production volume in 1953 would exceed the original output of 1952 by 30 percent. The Zeng Guangfu mutual aid group in Shandong already had twenty wells in 1952. After listening to the report, they planned to increase the number to forty this year. Yang Xiuwen, a woman from Xiamen, even donated the souvenirs given to her by her lover. She said excitedly, "I want to give my most beloved items to the most beloved people." The Shandong Provincial Department of Health recently received one thousand boxes of emergency kits and one thousand boxes of plaster sent by a unit after cleaning out their warehouse. After listening to the report, they immediately handed them over to the Shandong Provincial Sub-branch of the抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) Association to be donated to you. Zhang Fengying, a model military family member in Hangzhou City, has two sons, one in Korea and one studying in the navy. After listening to the report, she said, "The American bandits cruelly killed Korean women and children, which is really hateful. I will write to my son and ask him to demand blood debts from the American bandits. I will also go back and tell my nine-year-old son the heroic stories of the Volunteer Army, so that he knows that the Volunteer Army is protecting him, and I will tell him to study hard." After listening to the report, the cadres compared their own work with the work of the Volunteer Army to urge themselves to work harder. Some people criticized their past thoughts of not being at ease with their work and their procrastination, and resolved to correct their mistakes and do their work well. The students said that they would study hard, strengthen their bodies, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. In the industrial and commercial circles, the report also played a great role. For example, after listening to the report, the industrial and commercial circles in Wenzhou City, the pharmaceutical industry and the soap industry paid off their national taxes half a month in advance, and challenged other industries in the city. The next day, seventeen industries responded to the challenge and guaranteed to complete the winter tax payment before January 15.

Dear Volunteer Army comrades, your high degree of patriotism and revolutionary heroism has touched everyone and become a great source of encouragement for the people of the motherland. There are too many vivid and touching examples we found in the reports, and we cannot write them all out. These facts do not mean that our reporting work is done very well; we have not done it deeply or universally enough; this shows how much the people of the motherland love you, how much they want to hear your victory news, and how much they yearn to know your daily lives.

Although our慰问 (comforting and appreciation) work and传达 (conveying messages) work have come to an end, our work is not over. In the days to come, we will continue to educate the people of the whole country, as well as ourselves, with your heroic fighting spirit and love for the motherland, and continue to work hard in various positions, striving for greater victories in the抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea) struggle and ensuring the victorious development of the motherland's large-scale economic construction. Finally, we extend our highest respect to you – our most beloved people!

Chen Tongsheng, Deputy Head of the Fourth Sub-group of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea

    你们的精神鼓舞了全华东人民
    ——中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团第四分团副团长陈同生给志愿军的一封信敬爱的志愿军同志：
    我们离开你们不觉已过了三个月，我们无时无刻不在想念着你们。我们回国以后，为了很好地将你们和朝鲜人民克服困难、英勇作战取得伟大胜利的事迹，分头告诉祖国各地同胞，上级决定我们第四分团负责在华东区作传达工作。我们接受了这个任务，在总团的指导下，先在天津总结了慰问工作，并对传达工作做了应有的各种准备和典型试验。我们决定不休息，一进入华东区，即在山东省开始传达，随后按计划先后到安徽省、南京市、江苏全省、上海市、浙江省和福建省进行传达。
    我们走遍了祖国的东海岸。我们到处受到群众的热烈欢迎和欢呼。在华东各地一百四十六个县市和上海、南京两个大城市，我们向工人、农民、部队、青年、妇女、民主党派、文教、工商、宗教各界和少数民族人民，共作了一千二百四十一场报告。据不完全统计，听众在二百三十六万以上。至于看到照片展览和收听广播报告的人数，还无法统计，仅浙江省便有四十余万人收听了广播。
    在浙江福建两省的沿海地区人民，正在加紧巩固海防工作。守备沿海各岛屿上的武装队伍，正在警惕地监视着海洋，保卫着祖国东南大门。他们以艰苦奋斗的精神，不断打击敢来骚扰的残匪。我们曾经到过那些地方，不但将你们的英勇作战的精神告诉了他们，还向他们介绍了一些你们的战斗经验，并且向他们作了殷切的慰问。他们一致表示要向志愿军学习，决心用自己的血肉保护我们神圣不可侵犯的祖国土地。
    我们在华东各地所作的报告、广播和举行的照片展览，都在各界人民中起了很大的教育作用，鼓舞了他们的工作、学习、生产以及加强抗美援朝工作的热情。杭州市普华工厂劳动模范俞登润听了报告后，感到自己的工作成绩和志愿军比起来，还相差太远，因此决心在一月份装好四百匹马力的新发电机。福建漳州余丰布厂全体工人写了一封慰问信给你们，保证一九五三年生产量要超过一九五二年原产量百分之三十。山东曾广富互助组，一九五二年已有二十眼井，听了报告后计划在今年争取增加到四十眼。厦门妇女杨修文把爱人送给她的纪念品也献了出来，她兴奋地说：“我要把我最可爱的物品，送给最可爱的人。”山东省人民政府卫生厅最近接受了某单位清理仓库后送来的一千箱救急包和一千箱石膏，听了报告后，他们立即交山东省抗美援朝分会转献给你们。杭州市军属模范张凤英，有两个儿子，一个在朝鲜，一个在海军学习，听了报告后说：“美国强盗惨杀朝鲜妇女儿童，实在太可恶了，我要写信叫我儿子向美国强盗讨还血债，我还要回去把志愿军的英勇故事讲给九岁的小儿子听，叫他晓得有志愿军在保卫他，并叫他好好学习。”机关干部们听了报告以后，把自己的工作和志愿军的工作相比，来督促自己更加努力工作，有的人并批判了过去不安心工作的思想和疲沓现象，决心改正错误，做好工作。学生们表示要好好学习，炼好身体，随时准备响应祖国的号召。在工商界中，传达报告也起了很大的作用，如温州市工商界听了报告后，当时就有新药业和肥皂业两个行业提前半个月交清国税，并向全市其他行业提出挑战。第二天便有十七个行业应战，纷纷保证在一月十五日以前完成冬季缴税工作。
    亲爱的志愿军同志们，你们高度的爱国主义和革命英雄主义事迹，感动了所有的人，成了祖国人民莫大的鼓舞力量。我们在报告中所发见的生动感人的例子太多了，我们无法把它们全部写出来。这些事实，并不是说明我们的传达工作做得很好，我们还做得很不深入，也很不普遍；这是说明祖国人民是多么热爱你们，是多么希望听到你们的胜利消息，是多么渴望知道你们的日常生活。
    我们的慰问工作和传达工作虽然已告一段落，但我们的工作并没有完结，在今后的日子里，我们将继续以你们的英勇战斗精神和热爱祖国的精神教育全国人民，也教育自己，在各种不同的岗位上继续努力，为争取抗美援朝斗争更伟大的胜利，为保证祖国大规模经济建设的胜利开展而奋斗。最后，向你们——我们最可爱的人，致以最崇高的敬礼！
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团第四分团副团长  陈同生
    二月十四日
