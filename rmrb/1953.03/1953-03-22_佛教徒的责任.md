    The Responsibility of Buddhists
    By Yuan Ying, Chinese Representative to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference

    At the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference last year, I heard representatives from various countries almost without exception accuse the American militarists. In particular, the accusations by the Korean representatives of the American aggressors’ acts of slaughtering women, children, and peaceful residents shocked me greatly. For these innocent sufferers, I felt intense grief in my heart.

    Recently, the confessions of American prisoners of war Hu Weibuer and Blair, as disclosed in the newspapers, completely exposed that the American aggressors not only want to enslave most of the people in the world, making them live in hunger and poverty, and not only want to carry out cruel wars of aggression, but are also deliberately and systematically plotting to murder humanity. The crime of the American aggressors in plotting to expand the use of bacteriological weapons to exterminate humanity dwarfs any behavior in history that violates moral principles. This crime is an unprecedented moral depravity in human history, a major shame in human history. The American aggressors have become the common enemy of mankind. We Buddhists deeply believe in karma. Those who commit major evil deeds will surely suffer even greater evil consequences.

    As a 76-year-old Buddhist monk, for decades, I have grieved for the suffering of our country and people under the oppression of aggressors; for more than three years, I have been elated by the happiness of our liberated country and people. I deeply realize how our government and people are working hard for domestic peaceful construction and for the international cause of peace. We cherish peace, we love peace. This is easy to understand, only those who have suffered the hardships of war know how precious peace is. However, today the enemies of peace have ulterior motives. Unbounded greed and hatred have made them lose their rationality, and they have even resorted to using weapons of mass destruction to threaten all of humanity. Peace has already become the common and urgent demand of the people of any country in the world. As a member of the Chinese people and Buddhists who defend peace, I cannot but think of my own responsibility.

    Last year, Buddhists from eight countries attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference issued a joint statement, calling on all Buddhist brothers and sisters to unite and work hard for the cause of peace. This statement should be given greater attention by us Buddhists today. Buddhists are dedicated to "repaying the kindness of all sentient beings" and "saving sentient beings from suffering." Stopping aggression and defending peace should be our concrete actions of repaying kindness and saving suffering today.

    We must expose the criminal acts of the American aggressors to the people of the world in a timely manner, so that they cannot hide and deceive in front of the people. We must demand a ban on the use of all weapons of mass destruction and stop the criminal act of murdering humanity. We must demand an immediate end to the Korean War. Only by extinguishing the flames of war can we pave the way for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. We must remind everyone that any dispute resolution should be sought through consultation, not through force. I believe that this is not only the opinion of Buddhists, but also the common view of all religious people and all people with conscience.

    Justice will surely triumph over violence, compassion will surely triumph over hatred, and peace will surely triumph over aggression!

    佛教徒的责任
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议中国代表　圆瑛
    去年在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上，我听见了各国人民的代表几乎无例外地对美国黩武主义者的控诉。特别是朝鲜代表控诉美国侵略者残杀妇女、儿童以及和平居民的行为，使我异常惊骇。为着这些无辜的受苦难者，我内心感到剧烈的悲痛。
    最近，报纸上披露的美国俘虏许威布尔和布莱的供词，完全暴露了美国侵略者不仅是要奴役世界上大多数人，使之生存于饥饿贫困之中；不仅是要进行残酷的侵略战争；而且正处心积虑，有计划地对人类进行谋杀。美国侵略者阴谋扩大使用细菌武器来灭绝人类的罪行，使得历史上任何违反道德原则的行为相形减色。这种罪行是人类历史上空前未有的道德堕落，是人类历史上重大的耻辱。美国侵略者已成为人类共同的敌人。我们佛教徒是深信因果的。造重大恶因的人，必将受更重大的恶果。
    作为一个七十六岁的佛教僧人，几十年来，我曾为我们国家和人民在侵略者压迫下的苦难而悲痛过；三年多来，我又为我们解放后的国家和人民的幸福而欢欣鼓舞。我深深体会到，我们的政府和人民如何在为国内和平建设而努力，为国际和平事业而努力。我们珍视和平，我们热爱和平。这是不难理解的，只有受尽了战争苦难的人，才愈知道和平之可贵。然而今天和平的敌人是别有肺肝的。无底止的贪瞋，使他们丧尽了理性，竟至使用大规模杀人武器，来威胁全人类。和平已经是全世界任何国家的人民共同的迫切要求了。作为保卫和平的中国人民和佛教徒一分子，我不能不想到自己的责任。
    去年，出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的八个国家佛教徒曾发表联合声明，号召所有佛教兄弟姊妹团结起来为和平事业而努力。这一声明，今天应当更引起我们佛教徒的重视。佛教徒是以“报众生恩”“救众生苦”为职志的。制止侵略，保卫和平应当是我们今天报恩救苦的具体行动。
    我们必须向全世界人民及时揭发美国侵略者的罪恶行为，使之无法在人民面前掩饰欺骗。我们必须要求禁止使用一切大规模杀人武器，停止罪恶的谋杀人类的行为。我们必须要求立即停止朝鲜战争，只有扑灭了战争的火焰，才能为和平解决朝鲜问题铺设道路。我们必须提醒一切的人，任何纠纷解决，应当求之协商，而不应诉之武力。我相信，这不仅是佛教徒的意见，而是所有宗教人士以及一切有良心的人共同的看法。
    正义一定战胜强暴，慈悲一定战胜仇恨，和平一定战胜侵略！
