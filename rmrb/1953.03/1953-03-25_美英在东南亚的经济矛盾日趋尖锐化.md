In the shrinking capitalist world market, the struggle between the United States and Britain for commodity sales markets, industrial raw materials, and investment markets is intensifying in the Southeast Asian region, which is rich in natural resources but economically backward.

Since the end of the war, under the fierce offensive of American monopoly capital and the Japanese and West German capital it controls, Britain's long-held position as the leading seller of goods in Southeast Asia has been squeezed out. The proportion of American goods in the total import volume of the entire Southeast Asian region has doubled compared to pre-war levels, reaching 24 percent, while Britain's has decreased by one-tenth, falling to 18 percent. At the same time, the import volume of goods from Japan and West Germany, under American control, to Southeast Asia is also rapidly increasing. According to the Japan Economic Review Committee, in the past four years, goods exported from Japan to Southeast Asia accounted for 40 percent of its total exports, compared to only 20 percent before the war.

India, originally one of Britain's largest commodity markets, has seen the proportion of American goods in its total import volume increase from 7.3 percent in 1938 to 33.47 percent in 1951, while Britain's simultaneously decreased from 30.6 percent to 18.4 percent. In the fiscal year 1951-1952, American imports to India exceeded British imports by 1.3 billion rupees.

In the British-ruled colony of Malaya, American imports in 1948 increased ninefold compared to 1938, while Britain's increased only fourfold during the same period. The total value of Japanese goods exported to Malaya in 1951 increased more than sixteenfold compared to the pre-war year of 1940. West German imports to Malaya increased more than threefold in 1951 compared to 1950, and thirty-onefold compared to 1948.

America's economic power in Thailand, which was originally small, has also rapidly increased since the war. Before the war, there were only two American companies in Thailand; now there are seventy. American exports to Thailand in 1949 increased twenty-sixfold compared to pre-war levels, and in 1951 increased another 57 percent compared to 1949. According to materials published by the United Nations, Japan's imports to Thailand in 1948 were only a little over $5 million, increasing to over $22 million in 1949, and then soaring to over $42 million in 1950; West Germany's imports to Thailand in 1948 were only $200,000, increasing to $3 million in 1950, and then increasing to over $8 million in 1951.

In Indonesia, in 1938, American and British goods accounted for about 8 percent each of Indonesia's total import volume, but by 1950, Britain had fallen to 6.8 percent, while America had increased to 19.3 percent. If the goods of Japanese capitalists under American control are included, then American and Japanese goods account for more than 30 percent of Indonesia's total import value.

While seizing commodity markets, the United States is also taking various measures to control the raw material markets and prices of Southeast Asia. A fierce struggle has broken out between the United States and Britain over the prices of rubber and tin. The United States needs rubber and tin from Malaya. When the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea and vigorously purchased strategic raw materials and stepped up its arms expansion and war preparations, Britain took the opportunity to raise the prices of rubber and tin in order to earn more much-needed US dollars. But the United States immediately retaliated. After the United States took a series of measures to drive down prices, such as forcibly implementing an "embargo" policy, increasing synthetic rubber production, restricting natural rubber consumption, and reducing purchases of Malayan rubber, rubber prices indeed plummeted, from 2.4 Malayan dollars per pound to about 70 cents. The situation with tin was the same. Under American price suppression measures, tin prices continued to fall sharply, from 780 Malayan dollars per picul to about 470 dollars.

Moreover, in order to further monopolize the raw material market in Southeast Asia, and adopt a strategy of divide and conquer, the United States separately signed long-term agreements with Thailand and Indonesia to purchase rubber and tin in order to strike at Britain. This method of the United States quickly caused Singapore to gradually lose its status as a raw material transshipment port, thereby further weakening Britain's economic position in Southeast Asia. America's "Life" magazine expressed particular satisfaction with this point: "Before the war, Thailand's trade with the United States actually had to be transshipped through Singapore, but... the efforts of the US delegation to Thailand have made direct transactions possible..."

The American financial oligarchy is not satisfied with seizing Britain's commodity and raw material markets in Southeast Asia, but also continues to increase investment in Southeast Asian countries. American capital enters Southeast Asia in three ways: first, the American government's so-called "aid." Since the end of the war, the US government has provided nearly $7 billion in military and economic "aid" to the Asian region. Second, is the so-called "Truman's Point Four Program" to "aid" backward countries. The real purpose of this kind of American "aid," as US Senator Smith admitted, is to "lay the foundation for American private investment in backward countries." Third, direct private investment. American investment in Southeast Asia has increased the fastest and the most in India. According to the US Department of Commerce's "Foreign Commerce Weekly": In 1949, US private direct investment in India was 620,000 rupees, increasing to 1.18 million rupees in 1950, and soaring to 30.4 million rupees in 1951, a fiftyfold increase in two years. In Malaya, American investment in 1951 also doubled compared to 1950.

In order to resist the fierce offensive of American monopoly capital and the Japanese capital it controls, Britain has taken some measures, such as reducing the entry of American and Japanese goods into the sterling area by increasing tariff rates on goods from the dollar area and Japan, and proposing the British Commonwealth's six-year development plan for the Southeast Asian region, the so-called "Colombo Plan," to counter the intrusion of American capital. However, Britain, which was greatly weakened in World War II and whose economic situation is becoming increasingly difficult due to the implementation of arms expansion and war preparation policies, is increasingly unable to withstand the American offensive. The "Financial Times," the mouthpiece of British monopoly capital, predicted gloomily on March 2 that the prospects for British trade in the Far Eastern market "do not currently appear very promising." Japanese and West German capital under American control are determined to "obtain an even larger share of the Southeast Asian market than they currently have." The Singapore Chamber of Commerce, composed of agents of British monopoly capital, recently issued its 1952 annual report, also sadly stating regarding Britain's "traditional market" in Malaya: "The outlook for 1953 can be considered extremely dismal."

    美英在东南亚的经济矛盾日趋尖锐化
    在缩小了的资本主义世界市场中，美国和英国在天然资源丰富但经济落后的东南亚地区，争夺商品销售市场、工业原料和投资市场的斗争正越来越激烈。
    战后以来，在美国垄断资本和它控制下的日本和西德资本的猛烈进攻下，英国长久以来在东南亚地区所保持的在销售商品上为首的地位，已经被挤掉了。美国商品在整个东南亚地区的总输入额中所占的比重，比战前增加了一倍，达到百分之二十四，而英国却减少了十分之一，降到百分之十八。同时，在美国控制下的日本和西德的商品对东南亚的输入额也在迅速增加。据日本经济评议委员会说，在过去四年中，日本输往东南亚的货品占它的输出总值的百分之四十，而战前只有百分之二十。
    印度本来是英国商品的最大市场之一的，但是美国商品在印度总输入额中的比重，已从一九三八年的百分之七点三增加到一九五一年的百分之三十三点四七，而英国在同时期却从百分之三十点六降到百分之十八点四。在一九五一—一九五二年度内，美国输入印度的商品比英国多达十三亿卢比。
    在英国直接统治的殖民地马来亚，美国输入的商品在一九四八年比一九三八年增加了九倍，而英国同时期只增加了四倍。日本商品输往马来亚的总值，一九五一年比战前一九四零年增加了十六倍多。西德输入马来亚的商品，一九五一年比一九五零年增加三倍多，比一九四八年增加三十一倍。
    美国在泰国的经济势力本来很小，战后也已迅速增加。战前，美国在泰国只有两家公司，战后已增加到七十家。美国输往泰国的商品在一九四九年比战前增加二十六倍，在一九五一年又比一九四九年增加百分之五十七。据联合国公布的材料，日本在一九四八年对泰国的输入只有五百多万美元，一九四九年增至二千二百多万元，一九五零年又激增到四千二百多万元；西德在一九四八年对泰国的输入只有二十万美元，一九五零年增至三百万元，一九五一年又增加到八百多万元。
    在印尼，一九三八年，美英商品在印尼输入总额中所占比重都是百分之八左右，但到了一九五零年，英国却降到百分之六点八，而美国增加到百分之十九点三，如把美国控制下的日本资本家的商品合计在一起，那么美、日商品就占印尼输入总值的百分之三十以上。
    和夺取商品市场同时，美国还采取各种手段来控制东南亚原料的市场和价格。美国和英国之间展开了关于橡胶和锡的价格的激烈斗争。美国是需要马来亚的橡胶和锡的。当美国发动侵朝战争并极力搜购战略原料、加紧扩军备战的时候，英国乘机抬高了橡胶和锡的价格，以图赚取更多的它所急需的美元。可是美国立刻就加以还击。在美国采取了强制推行“禁运”政策、增加人造胶生产、限制天然胶消费量、减购马来亚橡胶等一连串压低价格的措施后，橡胶价格果然就直线下泻，从每磅马来亚币二元四角一直跌到七角左右。锡的情形也一样，在美国的压价措施下，锡价不断猛跌，从每担马来亚币七百八十元一直跌到四百七十元左右。
    不仅如此，美国为了进一步垄断东南亚的原料市场，并采取各个击破的手段，分别和泰国、印尼签订购买橡胶和锡的长期协定以打击英国。美国的这个办法很快地使新加坡日渐失掉原料转口港的地位，因而也进一步削弱了英国在东南亚的经济地位。美国“生活”杂志对于这一点特别表示满意：“战前，泰国对美贸易，实际上要通过新加坡转手，但是……美驻泰代表团的努力已使直接交易成为可能……”
    美国金融寡头集团不以夺取英国在东南亚的商品和原料市场为满足，同时也不断增加对东南亚各国的投资。美国资本用三种方式侵入东南亚：第一、美国政府的所谓“援助”。战后以来，美国政府给亚洲区域的军事和经济“援助”已近七十亿美元。第二、就是所谓“援助”落后国家的“杜鲁门第四点计划”。美国的这种“援助”的真正目的，正如美国参议员史密斯所承认的，是要“为美国人在落后国家中的私人投资打下基础”。第三、私人直接投资。美国在东南亚的投资以在印度增加得最快、最多。据美国商务部出版的“国外商务周刊”透露：一九四九年，美在印度私人直接投资为六十二万卢比，一九五零年增加到一百十八万卢比，一九五一年激增至三千零四十万卢比，两年之间共增加了五十倍。在马来亚，美国的投资在一九五一年也比一九五零年增加了一倍。
    英国为了抵抗美国垄断资本和它控制下的日本资本的猛烈进攻，虽然也曾采取了一些措施，像用提高对美元区及日本货物的关税率的办法，来削减美日商品的进入英镑地区，提出英联邦的东南亚地区六年开发计划，就是所谓“科伦坡计划”，来对抗美国资本的侵入，但是，在第二次世界大战中被大大地削弱并因执行扩军备战政策而经济情况日益困难的英国，已经越来越感到无法招架美国的进攻了。英国垄断资本的喉舌“金融时报”三月二日沮丧地预测：英国在远东市场贸易的前途，“目前看来希望并不很大”。美国控制下的日本、西德资本，决心在东南亚市场中“取得比现在所得到的还要大的地盘”。英国垄断资本代理人组成的新加坡商会最近发表的一九五二年年报，对于英国在马来亚的这一“传统市场”也悲哀地说：“一九五三年的前景可以认为是极其令人沮丧的。”（新华社）
