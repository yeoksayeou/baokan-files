　　On-the-job cadres (50,000 at the first level) and all Communist Party members in Beijing began studying documents commemorating Comrade Stalin on March 13. The Party committees at all levels of the CPC attached great importance to this study. Responsible cadres in many units gave mobilization reports to all cadres, and some even personally lectured to general cadres. All cadres and Party members in the city studied with great enthusiasm. After several days of study, the participating cadres and Party members realized that:

　　(1) The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our model, and the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is unbreakable, thus strengthening the idea of Sino-Soviet unity. As one cadre from the Beijing-Tianjin Highway Transportation Bureau said, "When Comrade Stalin passed away, I was sad and anxious, but after studying Comrade Malenkov's speech at the memorial service in Moscow, I became firm." Fifty-eight cadres from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Real Estate Management Bureau joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association during this study.

　　(2) We must transform grief into a huge force for improving our work in order to inherit the great cause unfinished by Stalin and build our country. The lathe team of Factory 25333 completed its production task eight days ahead of schedule, and the forging team completed one hundred hours of work in sixty hours. Workshop 53 of the People's Printing Plant created a new method of "using ink to nourish ink," making the printing clear and solving the problem of scrapped products; Workshops 25 failed to complete their production tasks in January and February, and the tasks in early March were also poorly completed. After studying, they put forward the slogan of "Using our brains, teaching well and learning well, improving quantity, and ensuring quality," and quickly broke through the average monthly production target. Many teachers at Beijing No. 1 Women's Middle School expressed that they would actively learn from advanced Soviet experience. At present, they ensure that they play the leading role of teachers in accordance with the "review method" in Soviet pedagogy, so that students can truly firmly grasp the main knowledge. One cadre from the Beijing Company of China National Department Store said: "I am determined to learn the knowledge of socialist economic construction and improve our work." Some cadres from the Xidan District Office of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China reviewed their past lackluster ideas about production competitions and conscientiously revised their competition plans.

　　In order to further deepen this study, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC invited Comrade Deng Tuo on the 18th to give a report on several ideological issues in studying the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin, and plans to hold two special reports on "Comrade Stalin's Life" and "Comrade Stalin's Theory on the Chinese Revolution" in the near future.

    北京市在职干部和全体共产党员
    学习悼念斯大林同志的文件
    北京市一级五万在职干部和全体共产党员从三月十三日开始进行了悼念斯大林同志的文件学习。中共各级党委对这一学习极为重视，很多单位的负责干部向全体干部作了动员报告，有的更亲自给一般干部讲课。全市干部及党员都以高度的热情进行学习。经过这几天的学习，参加学习的干部和党员认识到：
        （一）苏联共产党是我们的模范，中苏两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的，因而，更加坚定了中苏团结的思想。如京津公路运输局一干部说：“斯大林同志刚逝世时，我是悲痛、焦虑的，但学习了马林科夫同志在莫斯科追悼会上的讲话以后，我就坚定起来了。”北京市人民政府房地产管理局的干部有五十八人在这次学习中，参加了中苏友好协会。
        （二）必须把悲痛化为改进工作的巨大力量，以继承斯大林未完成的伟大事业，建设我们的国家。二五三三三工厂车工小组提前八天完成了生产任务，锻工一班以六十小时完成一百小时的工作。人民印刷厂五三车间创造以墨养墨的新工作法，使打版清楚，解决了产品作废问题；二五车间一、二月未完成生产任务，三月上旬的任务也完成得很差，经过学习，提出“开动脑筋，教好学好，提高数量，保证质量”的口号，很快就突破了每月的平均生产指标。北京市立第一女子中学许多教师表示要积极学习苏联先进经验，目前保证按苏联教育学中的“复习方式”发挥教师的主导作用，使学生真正能够牢固地掌握主要知识。中国百货公司北京市公司一个干部说：“我要决心学好社会主义经济建设的知识，改进我们的工作。”中国人民银行北京市分行西单区办事处有的干部检讨了过去生产竞赛没劲的思想，认真修订了竞赛计划。
    中共北京市委员会宣传部为使这一学习进一步深入，在十八日请邓拓同志就学习悼念斯大林同志文件的几个思想问题作了报告，并拟在最近举办“斯大林同志生平”、“斯大林同志关于中国革命问题的理论”两个专题报告。（新华社）
