One Issue to Note When Remolding the Thinking of Technical Personnel
An Gang

The political work departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have conducted patriotic education for technical personnel, helped them study the history of social development and current affairs, and carried out general ideological criticism, all of which are necessary. Now, political work must be further improved; many old work contents and methods have begun to fail to meet actual needs. Some technical personnel feel that political work is "separated by a wall" from their professional work, and that "political work is nothing more than meetings, reports, and ideological inspections." These statements are one-sided, but they are worth noting. Some of our political work cadres also say: "Technical personnel have studied the history of social development, but it doesn't solve many problems." "Last year (1952), we carried out movements three or four times. This year, we can't keep 'moving' forward. When we talk about general political principles, technical personnel listen and say: 'Ah, I've heard this before, tell me something new.'"

This is a new problem in political work. Many erroneous thoughts of technical personnel have not yet been exposed and criticized, the main part of which is hidden in technical thinking. These erroneous ideas are the root of wasteful designs and irresponsible thinking. Therefore, the ideological remolding of technical personnel must be combined with actual work, focusing on specific technical ideas. Using the methods of ideological construction in government offices or the old set of political work methods is not enough. A political work cadre in the design department of Anshan Iron and Steel said: "In the past, I worked in the workshop, engaging in politics and also learning technology. I understood the general rules and actual situation of technology, so I had a relatively deep understanding of the ideological state of technical personnel. I could mingle with technical personnel, grasp their specific thoughts, and help them solve some specific ideological problems, so I had the right to speak."

Recently, I talked with some technical personnel about the issue of safety coefficients in design. From their conversations, I deeply felt that if political work can use political principles to solve technical ideological problems well, it will play a significant role in politically remolding technical personnel.

Listen to these conversations.

"The safety coefficient issue?—said one engineer—we are not much better than you in this regard. It was only last year that we abandoned the conservative design standards learned from English and American books. At that time, the 'Provisional Standards for Structural Design of Buildings' promulgated by the Northeast People's Government and the 'Reinforced Concrete Structure Studies' published in the Soviet Union served as our introduction to learning from the advanced experience of Soviet civil engineering. Up to now, our thinking can be said to have been reversed." "In the past, the design standards we learned and used were all from capitalist countries like England and the United States. Capitalist countries did not have unified national standards, so what we learned was nothing more than the 'Chicago Building Code' or the 'U.S. Department of Commerce Building Code.' The common features of these codes are conservatism and waste. Taking concrete engineering as an example, if you look through any English or American book on this issue, the first principle stipulated is: 'All concrete projects must first consider construction.' Capitalists understand that the resistance and struggle of workers during construction will create various unsafe factors for the benefit of capitalists. Therefore, they want to increase the artificial safety coefficient to solve this problem. Our working class is the leading class, and our construction slogan is 'Centennial Plan, Quality First.' The bourgeoisie aims to pursue personal profits, and they squeeze and compete with each other. Therefore, design standards cannot but be dominated by the profits of capitalists. For example, building materials, the Soviet Union's materials are uniformly specified with various different grades according to the bearing capacity of the material and the different needs of the project, but in capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States, capitalists compete to produce 'brand-name products' in order to increase sales and make more money. As for us, everything is subject to the overall interests of the country. This saves the country a great deal of expenditure."

Although some of these conversations are not entirely thorough, they clearly show that the advanced Soviet technical theories and their practical effects have deeply touched the hearts of technical personnel, enabling them to more or less understand the great power of Marxism-Leninism and have a critique of bourgeois ideology.

The ideological remolding of technical personnel mainly requires them to see vivid real-life examples, calculated figures, experimental results, and other specific materials through the comparison of the old and the new, and then raise them to political principles to recognize the huge influence of Marxism-Leninism on technology, that socialist technology is a hundred times more advanced than capitalism. This is the most effective way to open up minds. Some technical personnel said:

"What reason do we have not to admire and learn from the Soviet Union? Look, when designing the soil bearing capacity of a foundation, if the geology in a certain place is 1.9 kg according to Soviet standards, then according to Japanese standards, it is 1.5 kg. That is to say, a foundation bearing 19 tons of weight only needs an area of one square meter according to the Soviet safety coefficient, while according to the Japanese safety coefficient, it needs an area of 1.266 square meters. In this way, the foundation area is increased by a quarter, which means that a quarter of the material is wasted. If 40,000 bags of cement are used, 10,000 more bags will be wasted according to the Japanese method.

"The results of implementing the 'Provisional Standards for Structural Design of Buildings' formulated by the former Northeast People's Government in accordance with advanced Soviet design standards, the timber, steel, and allowable stress have been increased by an average of about 20% compared with the past. The new reinforced concrete structure design can save a quarter compared with the past, and the allowable bearing capacity of the foundation is doubled compared with the past. In addition, for roof panels, designed according to Soviet national standards, only 2.5 cm thickness is required, while the usual regulations in England and the United States are 'no less than 10 cm'. We did not have major ideological resistance when implementing the new design standards because we had such convincing facts."

How can we achieve close integration of political work and technology?

The most important point is that political workers must break the tendency of not asking about science and technology and not caring about business, but should face science and technology, study business, and go deep into the midst of technical personnel to carry out political work, oppose the method of conducting political work abstractly, divorced from the actual thoughts and lives of technical personnel, and proceed from reality and conduct ideological education in combination with the actual work of technical personnel. Some political workers hold a mysterious view of technical work, feeling that "when talking with technical personnel, they don't understand many technical issues and can't talk," so they limit the scope of work only to general political mobilization, ideological education, and ideological inspection. Even in the choice of work objects, they are willing to contact some young and enthusiastic trainee technical personnel, and are unwilling to patiently solve the problems of some old technical personnel and engineers, thinking that talking with these technical personnel is incompatible, and they are "dumbfounded" when they talk about technical terms. This fear of "technology" is actually giving up the political leadership of technical personnel. Some people say that political workers talking about technology is "showing off one's limited skills before an expert," which is a tailism thought. We must strengthen political work among technical personnel, and use political viewpoints to clarify the meaning of technology, correct the attitude of technical personnel towards technology, and combine technology with the needs of national political economy, in order to thoroughly eliminate capitalist ideology.

Many of our technical personnel understand that Soviet socialist technology is superior, but they cannot do it all at once, because they are limited by old styles and work methods. The political work department should help them establish a mass viewpoint, learn the work style of the mass line, and the most important thing is to organize everyone to learn from the example of Soviet experts. For example, when implementing Soviet design standards and using scientific safety coefficients, if technical personnel still do things according to the old style, it will definitely cause serious losses. Because the safety coefficient used by technical personnel in the past was increased, they could work carelessly and roughly. For example, steel, in the past, was only divided into Chinese steel and British steel in design, and was adopted according to the performance specifications of various steels in the books, and no experiments were ever done. Soviet experts are completely the opposite. They are never satisfied with those book regulations. They must draw a few from the steel specially made for a certain project and conduct detailed experiments to find out the actual representative performance, and they are not sloppy at all. For example, in the past, the soil quality of our factory buildings was only tested for load, that is, a pit was dug, a certain weight was placed on it, and the degree of subsidence was observed, and the data of the soil bearing capacity was obtained from this; Soviet experts would conduct drilling, take out the soil for chemical and physical analysis, and obtain the corrosive effect of the local soil's chemical composition on building materials, and find out its bearing capacity from its physical properties. Political workers should often help, mobilize, and encourage technical personnel to take Soviet experts as their role models, learn the scientific and realistic work style of Marxism-Leninism, and criticize the old work style and old methods. We must explain to technical personnel that without the precise, scientific, and meticulous work style of Soviet experts who are absolutely responsible to the people, we cannot accept and apply socialist technology.

Political workers must be determined to gradually improve their cultural and theoretical level in a planned way, in order to understand and master advanced scientific and technological theories and enrich the ideological content of political work. Political workers must take the initiative to study business together with technical personnel, unite the progressive elements among technical personnel as the backbone to promote the progress of all technical personnel, and specifically help technical personnel criticize old ideas and establish new ideas in work and thought.

    改造技术人员思想应当注意的一个问题
    安岗
    鞍山钢铁公司的政治工作部门曾对技术人员进行了爱国主义教育，帮助技术人员学习了社会发展史和时事政治，进行了一般的思想批判，这都是必要的。现在，政治工作必须进一步提高；许多旧的工作内容和方法已经开始不能适应实际需要。有的技术人员感到政治工作同业务关系“隔了一层墙”，“政治工作反正不外乎开会，作报告，检查思想”。这些说法是有片面性的，但是，它是值得注意的。我们某些政治工作干部也说：“技术人员学了社会发展史但解决问题不大。”“去年（一九五二年）搞运动搞了三四回，今年再不能不断地‘运动’下去。讲一般的政治道理，技术人员听了说：‘啊，这个我早已听过了，讲点新的吧。’”
    这是政治工作中一个新的问题。技术人员中有不少的错误思想还没有暴露和被批判，其中主要的部分是隐藏在技术思想中。这些错误的思想是浪费的设计和不负责任思想的根源。因此，对技术人员的思想改造工作必须结合实际工作，抓住具体的技术思想来进行。用机关思想建设的办法或老一套的政治工作方法是不够的。鞍钢设计处一个政治工作干部说：“我过去在车间里，搞政治同时也摸技术。懂得了技术的一般规则和实际情况，因而也就比较深刻地了解了技术人员的思想状况，可以同技术人员打成一片，可以摸到他们的具体思想，帮助他们解决一些具体的思想问题，于是就有了发言权。”
    最近，我同一些技术人员谈起设计中采用安全系数的问题。从他们的谈话中，我深深地感到，如果政治工作能够用政治原则很好地解决技术思想问题，那对于从政治上改造技术人员会起很大的作用。
    请听这些谈话吧。
    “安全系数问题吗，——一位工程师说——这我们并不比你们高明多少。我们抛弃从英美书本上学来的保守的设计标准，那不过是去年的事情。那时，东北人民政府颁布的‘建筑物结构设计暂行标准’和苏联出版的钢筋混凝土结构学作了我们学习苏联土木建筑先进经验的入门。到现在为止，我们的思想可以说是扭转过来了。 “过去，我们学的和用的设计标准都是英美等资本主义国家的一套。资本主义国家并没有全国统一的标准，因此，我们所学的也不过是什么‘芝加哥建筑规范’，‘美国商务部建筑规范’。这些规范的共同特点是：保守和浪费。拿混凝土工程作例子吧，你翻看任何一本有关这个问题的英美书籍，上面规定的第一条原则就是：‘凡是混凝土的工程首先必须考虑到施工’。资本家懂得，工人在施工中的反抗斗争会造成各种对资本家利益的不安全的因素，因此，他们要加大人工的安全系数，来解决这个问题。我们的工人阶级是领导阶级，我们的施工的口号是‘百年大计，质量第一’。资产阶级以追求个人利润为目的，他们互相倾轧竞争，因而，设计的标准就不能不受资本家的利润支配。比如建筑材料，苏联的材料都是按照材料的承受力和工程的不同需要而统一规定了各种不同的标号，但在英美等资本主义国家，资本家就竞相出‘名牌货’，使自己的产品销路大，赚钱多。我们呢，一切都是服从国家整体利益。这就节省了国家极大的开支。”
    这些谈话虽然有的说得并不十分周到，但它确切地表明，苏联的先进技术理论，及其实际效果，深深打动了技术人员的心，使他们或多或少地领会了马列主义的伟大力量，并对资产阶级思想有了批判。
    技术人员思想的改造主要是要通过他们亲眼看到的新旧对比的活人活事、计算数字、试验结果等等具体材料，然后提高到政治原则上来认识马列主义对技术的巨大影响，社会主义的技术比资本主义高明百倍。这是打通思想最有效的方法。一些技术人员这样说：
    “我们能有什么理由不佩服和学习苏联呢？请看，设计一个基础的地耐力，若某处地质按照苏联标准是一·九公斤，那么按照日本标准就是一·五公斤。这就是说，一个承受十九吨重的基础，按照苏联的安全系数只用一个平方公尺的面积就够了，而照日本的安全系数就得用一·二六六平方公尺的面积，这样，就使基础面积加大了四分之一，也就是要浪费掉四分之一的材料，如果用四万袋的洋灰，按照日本的办法就要多浪费一万袋。
    “我们施行前东北人民政府按照苏联的先进设计标准而制订的建筑物结构设计暂行标准的结果，木材、钢材、许可应力较以往平均提高了百分之二十左右，新的钢筋混凝土结构设计竟可比过去节省到四分之一，地基许可耐压力比过去提高了一倍；此外，像屋面板，按照苏联国家标准设计，只要二·五公分厚度，英美等国通常的规定是‘不得少于十公分’。我们执行新设计标准时没有大的思想抵抗，就是因为有了这样令人完全信服的事实。”
    怎样才能作到政治工作与技术密切结合呢？
    最重要的一点是，政治工作者必须打破不问科学技术，不管业务的倾向，而应面向科学技术，钻研业务，深入到技术人员中间去进行政治工作，反对脱离技术人员实际思想和生活，抽象地进行政治工作的方法，要从实际出发，结合技术人员实际的工作进行思想教育。有的政治工作者对技术工作抱着神秘观点，觉得“跟技术人员谈话，许多技术问题不懂，谈不下去”，因而把工作的范围只限制在一般的政治鼓动、思想教育和思想检查上，甚至在工作的对象上又愿意去接触一些年轻热情的见习技术人员，不愿意耐心地去解决一些老技术人员、工程师的问题，认为同这些技术人员谈话，格格不入，一谈技术名词就“傻了眼”。这种怕“技术”的情绪，实际上是放弃了对技术人员的政治领导。有人说，政治工作人员谈技术，是“班门弄斧”，这是一种尾巴主义思想，我们必须加强在技术人员中的政治工作，要从政治观点上去阐明技术的意义，端正技术人员对技术的态度，使技术与国家政治的经济的需要相结合，以便彻底肃清资本主义的思想。
    我们有不少的技术人员懂得了苏联社会主义技术高明，但是一下子作不来，这是因为受了旧的作风和工作方法限制的缘故。政治工作部门要帮助他们树立群众观点，学习走群众路线的工作作风，最重要的是组织大家学习苏联专家的榜样。譬如在执行苏联的设计标准、使用科学的安全系数时，如果技术人员仍按照旧的作风办事，就一定会造成严重的损失。因为过去技术人员在设计中采用的安全系数是加大了的，所以就可以粗枝大叶、笼里笼统地进行工作，譬如钢材，过去在设计时只是把它分成中国钢、英国钢，按照书本上各种钢的性能规格加以采用，从来不做任何试验。苏联专家则完全相反，他们绝不以那些书本上的规定为满足，他们一定要从为一定工程特别制作的钢材中抽出几根，进行详细的试验，找出实际的代表性能，一点也不马虎。又如过去我们的厂房工程土质只作载荷试验，即挖个坑，放上一定重量，看其下沉的程度，由此得出地耐力的数据；苏联专家则要进行钻探，取出土壤进行化学及物理分析，得出当地土壤的化学成分对建筑材料的腐蚀作用，并由其物理性质找出其承载能力。政治工作者应当经常帮助、动员和鼓励技术人员以苏联专家为楷模，学习马列主义的科学的实事求是的作风，批判旧作风、旧方法。要向技术人员说明，没有像苏联专家这样对人民绝对负责的精密、科学、一丝不苟的作风，我们就无法接受和运用社会主义的技术。
    政治工作人员要下决心有计划地逐步提高自己的文化水平和理论水平，以便领会和掌握先进的科学技术理论，丰富政治工作的思想内容。政治工作人员必须主动地同技术人员一起钻研业务，团结技术人员中的进步分子作为推动全体技术人员进步的骨干，从工作上思想上具体地帮助技术人员批判旧思想，建立新思想。
