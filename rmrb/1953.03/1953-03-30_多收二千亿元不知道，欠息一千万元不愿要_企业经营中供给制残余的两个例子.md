“Not Knowing About an Overcollection of 200 Billion Yuan, Unwilling to Recover an Interest Due of 10 Million Yuan.” These are two problems discovered during the recent anti-bureaucracy campaign conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Trade.

The Commodity Accounting Section of the Finance and Accounting Department of the former China Import Company pre-collected 420 billion yuan from the China National Department Store on December 26, 1951, based on the estimated price of goods ordered from abroad by the China National Department Store. Part of this order should have been deducted from the pre-collected 420 billion yuan when letters of credit were issued to foreign countries at the end of 1951. However, because the Finance and Accounting Department of the China Import Company had not established a system for managing funds and its work and accounts were extremely chaotic, it pre-collected another 263 billion yuan from the China National Department Store for the letter of credit for this order on April 1, 1952. The Finance and Accounting Section of the China National Department Store also failed to verify whether the payment had already been made and transferred the excess 263 billion yuan to the China Import Company.

The Finance and Accounting Section of the China National Department Store overpaid 263 billion yuan at the end of April 1952, and did not discover this until the end of 1952; it was not discovered until the anti-bureaucracy campaign in February 1953.

The Finance and Accounting Section of the China Import Company did not discover that it had overcollected such a large sum until the China National Department Store raised the issue of verification and liquidation this February, and then returned the 263 billion yuan to the China National Department Store.

Another incident occurred on November 28, 1952, when Cai Xiu, a cadre in the Finance and Accounting Section of the China Machinery Import Company, miscalculated the time when settling interest lists for freight and insurance fees with various user departments, undercharging one month’s interest, totaling more than 10.054 million yuan. When the user departments discovered that the time was miscalculated, they inquired with Cai Xiu. Cai Xiu then discussed remedies with Wang Yulin, who was in charge of freight and insurance fees. Wang Yulin did not point out the error of Cai Xiu's careless work style, nor did he help him quickly admit the mistake to the user department and recover the month's interest. Instead, he adopted a "let it be" approach, instructing Cai Xiu to tell the user department that the mistake was due to writing "November" incorrectly as "October," and that the calculation was not wrong. He even had Cai Xiu use a pen to change the date of interest accrual from "October 7" to "November 7" on the original 52 documents written with carbon paper. Cai Xiu knew that the company had suffered a loss of more than 10 million yuan, but because Wang Yulin said that the amount of more than 10 million yuan was not a large sum and that it would be troublesome to recover the interest, he casually changed a word in an irresponsible manner and glossed over the matter. The head of the Finance and Accounting Section was unaware of this matter until the current inspection of the supply system mentality and irresponsible bureaucratic style in management was carried out, and it was exposed by comrades in the section.

From the above two incidents, it can be seen that some state enterprise employees do not attach importance to the significant responsibility entrusted to them by the people – the responsibility of managing the people's property. They do not yet regard themselves as the masters of the country, nor do they regard the state's funds as more important than their own property. Therefore, they cannot be as meticulous and responsible as they are when dealing with their own monthly salaries. These employees have not yet clearly resolved the relationship between the individual and the state in their thinking, nor have they established a correct work attitude of serving the people, and therefore lack a responsible spirit towards the property of the state and the people.

From these two incidents, it can also be seen that the central trade departments have not seriously implemented the economic accounting system, have not established a system for managing and verifying funds, and even the most basic budgeting system is being implemented haphazardly. There is a lack of planning in fund turnover, resulting in numerous loopholes.

We must overcome the irresponsible attitude towards state property, overcome the lazy supply system management mentality, seriously improve enterprise management, strictly implement the economic accounting system, accelerate fund turnover, reduce stockpiling, and save funds. In the current anti-bureaucracy campaign, we should combine it with checking current work, thoroughly inspect and settle uncleared accounts and warehouses, clarify the situation, affirm plans, establish systems for managing and verifying funds, determine fixed quotas for the fund turnover period, clarify the job responsibilities of each person, strengthen the connection and supervision between financial and economic departments, regularly inspect management work, and thoroughly overcome irresponsible and careless bureaucratic styles.

    “多收二千亿元不知道，欠息一千万元不愿要”
    ——企业经营中供给制残余的两个例子
    张维奇
    “多收二千亿元不知道，欠息一千万元不愿要。”这是中央对外贸易部最近开展反官僚主义斗争中检查发现的两个问题。
    前中国进口公司财会处商品会计科，在一九五一年十二月二十六日，根据中国百货公司向国外订货的估价，向中国百货公司预收了四千二百亿元。这批订货中的一部分，在一九五一年底向国外开付信用证，当时本来应该从预收的四千二百亿元里扣付。但由于中国进口公司财会处没有建立起管理资金的制度，工作及账目非常混乱，就在一九五二年四月一日又向中国百货公司预收这项订货的信用证款二千六百三十多亿元。中国百货公司财会科也未审核是否已经预交过款，就把多要的二千六百三十多亿元拨给中国进口公司。
    中国百货公司财会科在一九五二年四月底多付了二千六百三十多亿元，到一九五二年底还没有发觉这件事情；一直到一九五三年二月反官僚主义斗争中才检查出来了。
    中国进口公司财会科，多收了这么大一批款，经一年之久也未发现，直到今年二月中国百货公司提出查对清算的意见，才将二千六百三十多亿元退还给中国百货公司。
    另一件事是一九五二年十一月二十八日，中国机械进口公司财会科干部蔡岫，给各用货部门结算运保费的利息清单时，算错了时间，少要了一个月的利息，总计少收一千零五十四万余元。用货部门发现时间算错了，就向蔡岫查问。蔡岫就和负责运保费的王毓林商量补救的办法。王毓林没有指出蔡岫这种粗枝大叶的工作作风的错误，也没有帮助他迅速向用货部门承认错误，追回一月的利息，反而采取了将错就错的办法，让蔡岫告诉用货部门说，这是因为把十一月错写为十月，并没有算错。他还让蔡岫把五十二张单据上原用复写纸写的十月七日起付息的字样，都用钢笔改为十一月七日起付息的字样。蔡岫明知道公司受了一千多万元的损失，但因王毓林说一千多万元的数目不算多，追要利息又很麻烦，因此就以不负责任的态度，随便改上一个字，把事情混过去了。这事财会科科长也不知道，直到这次检查经营中的供给制思想和不负责的官僚主义作风时，才被该科同志揭发出来。
    从以上两件事情可以看出，某些国家企业工作人员对人民委托给他的重大责任——管理人民财产的责任，是很不重视的。他们还没有把自己看成国家的主人，没有把国家的资金看作比自己的财产还重要，因此就不能像处理自己每月的薪金那样，精打细算，认真负责。这些工作人员还没有在思想上明确地解决个人与国家的关系，还没有树立起为人民服务的正确工作态度，因此也就缺乏对国家人民财产认真负责的精神。
    从这两件事也可以看到，中央贸易部门中，还没有认真地贯彻执行经济核算制，还没有建立起对资金的管理和核定制度，甚至最基本的预决算制度也执行得糊里糊涂，资金周转更是缺乏计划性，因而漏洞百出。
    我们必须克服对国家财产不负责任的态度，克服懒惰的供给制经营思想，认真改善企业的经营管理，严格贯彻经济核算制，加速资金周转，减少积压，节约资金。在目前的反官僚主义斗争中，应该结合检查当前工作，将未清理的账目、仓库，作一清查结算，弄清家底，肯定计划，建立管理资金、核定资金的制度，确定资金周转限期定额，明确每个人的工作职责，加强财经部门互相间的联系与监督，经常检查经营管理工作，彻底克服不负责任、粗枝大叶的官僚主义作风。
