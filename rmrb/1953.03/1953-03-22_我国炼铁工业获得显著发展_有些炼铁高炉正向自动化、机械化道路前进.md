Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: China's iron smelting industry, which occupies a paramount position in large-scale economic construction, has achieved significant development in recent years. Currently, some iron smelting blast furnaces are advancing towards automation and mechanization, which is of great significance for the country's large-scale economic construction.

The rapid increase in pig iron production is one of the main achievements of China's iron smelting industry in recent years. If we take the pig iron production in 1950 as 100, then it increased to 144 in 1951, and further increased to 205 in 1952, reaching 98.9 percent of the highest annual production in history. The pig iron production of China's major iron and steel plants has shown a straight upward trend. Last year, the pig iron production of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant reached 529 percent of the annual production during the enemy-puppet period; the pig iron production of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant exceeded 2.7 times the highest annual production during the Japanese puppet period. At present, the highest records of unit area production of large and small blast furnaces in China have exceeded those of the United States and Britain, and are close to the advanced level of the Soviet Union.

The significant improvement in the quality of pig iron is another major achievement in China's iron smelting industry. Taking the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant as an example, in 1950, first-grade steelmaking pig iron accounted for only 25 percent of the plant's pig iron production, and the unqualified rate was 2.59 percent; but by last year, the proportion of first-grade steelmaking pig iron had increased to over 90 percent, and the unqualified rate had dropped to 0.73 percent. In the past, the pig iron produced in China could not be directly put into open-hearth steelmaking due to its low quality. Now, the main iron smelting plants in China can produce low-silicon steelmaking pig iron that meets the requirements. This kind of iron has excellent quality and can be directly used for steelmaking, which will play a great role in the development of China's steelmaking, machinery manufacturing and other industries.

The rapid improvement of pig iron production and quality is built on the basis of continuous improvement of technical equipment. In recent years, China's iron smelting industry has carried out several major technical reforms. Last year, the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company successfully trial-produced low-silicon iron using sintered ore, which opened up a new path for China to use iron ore with low iron content to smelt iron and shorten the smelting time. The so-called steel "experts" in the United States and Japan once believed that this sintered ore experiment was impossible to succeed. By mastering the Soviet Union's advanced methods such as "layered bricklaying" and "fast oven baking," Chinese iron smelting workers have greatly shortened the overhaul time of blast furnaces. For example, during the enemy-puppet rule, it took at least half a year to repair a furnace at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, but this year it only took 28 days to complete the overhaul of the No. 2 blast furnace. What is especially exciting is that the first automated iron smelting furnace has appeared in China, which is the No. 8 blast furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant that was recently ignited. From charging to tapping, many heavy and precise operations of this blast furnace are automated, which shows that China's iron smelting industry has begun to enter a new era.

With the recovery and development of China's iron and steel industry, new technical forces are rapidly growing. In recent years, iron and steel plants have trained a group of technical cadres and technical workers. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company alone trained more than 4,500 technical workers last year; at present, almost all blast furnace duty technicians in iron and steel plants in North China are trained from workers. The growth of this new technical force will promote the further development of China's iron smelting industry.

The reason why China's iron smelting industry has achieved rapid recovery and development in a short period of time is primarily inseparable from the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. Soviet experts have made great contributions to China's iron smelting industry. Soviet experts have put forward more than 2,000 opinions and suggestions to the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. The opinions and suggestions that have been implemented alone have significantly improved the plant's production technology and management work. A series of advanced experiences in Soviet iron smelting technology operations, such as the "full air fast charge smooth operation method," "furnace top adjustment method," "steam blast operation method," and "taphole protection method," have greatly improved the production and quality of pig iron after being promoted in various iron and steel plants in China. The project of rebuilding the No. 8 blast furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company into China's first automated blast furnace was also successful under the direct guidance of Soviet experts and the material assistance of the Soviet people. Another important reason why China's iron smelting industry can rapidly recover and develop is that after democratic reforms and production reforms in various iron and steel plants, the production enthusiasm of employees has greatly increased. This production enthusiasm, combined with the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, has become an important force to promote production. For example, last year, the average annual output of pig iron per worker in the Iron Smelting Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant increased by more than six times compared with 1944. In addition, the establishment of various systems in technical management by various plants to eliminate chaos in production is also a favorable factor promoting the smooth development of the iron smelting industry.

### 我国炼铁工业获得显著发展  有些炼铁高炉正向自动化、机械化道路前进

    我国炼铁工业获得显著发展
    有些炼铁高炉正向自动化、机械化道路前进
    【新华社二十日讯】在大规模经济建设中占有头等重要地位的我国炼铁工业，几年来获得了显著的发展，目前有些炼铁高炉正向着自动化、机械化的道路前进，这对于全国大规模的经济建设具有十分重大的意义。
    生铁产量的迅速增加，是我国炼铁工业在最近几年中所获得的主要成就之一。如以一九五○年的生铁产量为一百，那末，一九五一年就增加到一百四十四，一九五二年更增加到二百零五，达到历史上最高年产量的百分之九十八点九。我国各主要钢铁工厂的生铁产量都呈直线上升之势。去年，石景山钢铁厂的生铁产量，已达到敌伪时期年产量的百分之五百二十九；太原钢铁厂的生铁产量，超过了日伪时期最高年产量的二点七倍。现在我国大型和小型高炉的单位面积产量的最高纪录，都已超过美国和英国，而接近苏联的先进水平。
    生铁质量的显著提高，是我国炼铁工业中的另一个巨大成就。以鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂为例，一九五○年该厂所生产的生铁中，一级制钢生铁只占百分之二十五，不合格率占百分之二点五九；但到去年，一级制钢生铁的比例就增加到百分之九十强，不合格率降低到百分之零点七三。过去我国所产的生铁，由于质量低，不能直接投入平炉炼钢，而现在我国的主要炼铁厂都能炼出合乎要求的低矽制钢铁，这种铁的品质优良，可以直接炼钢，这对于我国炼钢、机器制造等工业的发展将起很大的作用。
    生铁产量和质量的迅速提高，是建筑在技术设备的不断改进的基础上的。最近几年来，我国炼铁工业曾进行了几件有重大意义的技术改革。去年国营鞍山钢铁公司试用烧结矿制炼低矽铁成功，为我国利用含铁成分低的矿石来炼铁和缩短冶炼时间，开辟了一条新的道路，而这种烧结矿的试验，曾经被美国和日本的所谓钢铁“专家”认为是不可能成功的。我国炼铁工人由于掌握了苏联的“分层砌砖”、“快速烘炉”等先进方法，因而大大缩短了高炉的大修时间，例如石景山钢铁厂在敌伪统治时期，修炉一次至少要半年时间，而今年只用了二十八天就完成了二号高炉的大修工程。尤其使人兴奋的是：在我国已经出现了第一座自动化的炼铁炉，这就是最近点火的鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂的八号高炉。这个高炉从装料到出铁，许多繁重的和精细的操作都是自动化的，这表明我国炼铁工业已开始进入一个崭新的时期。
    随着我国钢铁工业的恢复和发展，新的技术力量正在迅速地成长起来，各钢铁工厂几年来都培养出了一批技术干部和技术工人。鞍山钢铁公司只在去年就培养出四千五百多个技术工人；目前华北各钢铁厂高炉值班技术人员几乎全部是从工人中培养起来的。这一批新的技术力量的成长，将推进我国炼铁工业的进一步发展。
    我国炼铁工业所以能在短短的时间内获得迅速的恢复和发展，首先是和苏联的真诚无私的帮助分不开的。苏联专家对于我国炼铁工业作了巨大的贡献，苏联专家对太原钢铁厂就曾提出二千多条意见和建议，只已经实行的意见和建议，就使该厂的生产技术和管理工作获得显著改进。苏联炼铁技术操作上的“全风快料顺行法”、“炉顶调剂法”、“蒸汽鼓风操作法”、“出铁口保护法”等一系列的先进经验，在我国各钢铁厂推行后，都大大提高了生铁的产量和质量。鞍山钢铁公司改建第八号高炉为我国第一个自动化高炉的工程，更是在苏联专家的直接指导和苏联人民的物质援助下获得成功的。我国炼铁工业所以能迅速地得到恢复和发展，另一个重要原因是：各钢铁厂经过民主改革和生产改革以后，职工的生产积极性大大提高，这种生产积极性和苏联的先进经验结合起来，就成为推动生产的重要力量。例如去年石景山钢铁厂炼铁部平均每个工人年产的生铁量，比一九四四年增加了六倍多。此外，各厂在技术管理方面建立了各种制度，消除了生产中的混乱现象，这也是促使炼铁工业顺利发展的一个有利的因素。
