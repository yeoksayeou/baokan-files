Reader hopes that the Central People's Government will issue public bonds as soon as possible to accelerate the construction of the motherland.
    Editor's Note: The following is a summary of letters from readers such as Yu Zutong suggesting that the Central People's Government should issue public bonds as soon as possible to accelerate the construction of the motherland. We believe that the enthusiasm of these readers for the construction of the country is very good. Regarding the issue of public bonds, Minister of Finance Bo Yibo of the Central People's Government has proposed in the "Report on the 1953 National Budget":
    "Under the revenue item of the budget there is a public bond item, which will be issued at an appropriate time, and will be purchased by staff, workers, farmers and industrialists and businessmen across the country on a voluntary basis."
    "Let our volunteers also help the economic construction of the motherland"
                    (I)
    Yu Zutong of a volunteer army unit wrote: Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, our motherland has begun to enter its great first five-year plan this year. The construction upsurge in the motherland has greatly inspired our fighting spirit.
    I used to be an employee of a state-owned enterprise. A letter from home said that life is very prosperous; our lives in Korea have also improved, our monthly technical allowances have increased, and we have saved a lot of money. In our class, comrades have a common requirement in their hearts: We hope that the Central People's Government will consider issuing construction bonds as soon as possible so that our volunteers can also assist in the economic construction of the motherland. I bought twenty shares of the first phase of public bonds, and my mother wrote recently saying that they have all been profited and returned; she also asked that the second phase of public bonds be issued quickly.
                (II)
    Zhang Guozhang of a volunteer army unit wrote: I am a photographer in the volunteer army. More than two years ago, when the border of the motherland was threatened, I crossed the Yalu River to Korea. For more than two years, I have been missing the motherland all the time. Whenever I return from an interview and walk on the long mountain road at night, I don’t feel lonely; when I think of the workers sweating in the factories in the motherland, the farmers harvesting on both sides of the Huai River, the children wearing red scarves and smiling, ... my pace immediately quickens, and fatigue and cold are forgotten.
    This is the common feeling of all volunteer soldiers. Whether on the position, at the work site or in a warm cave, when talking about everything about the motherland, the comrades immediately have more to say. From a sewing kit to the flood diversion in Jingjiang, from the pickled mustard to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and even from a wire to the rapid development of Anshan Iron and Steel. All the achievements of the motherland inspire our fighting will. Everyone has a common wish: to defend the motherland with all our strength and make the motherland better.
    Recently, I participated in the photo selection in the army, and two of my works won prizes. Editor: Now I am sending you this money, and when the motherland starts issuing public bonds, please try to invest this money in the economic construction of the motherland. Although it is only 260,000 yuan, even if it is used to buy some bricks or a few pounds of nails for the construction of the motherland, it will achieve my heartfelt wish.
    Invest our savings in the national construction cause
                    (I)
    Reader Yang Yu wrote: I am a student of Class 64, Grade 5 of Harbin Foreign Languages ​​Special School. Under the education of the Party for two and a half years, I have established the concept of serving the people. The achievements and prospects of the motherland are blooming in everyone's heart; studying for the motherland has become the only slogan for us to improve our academic performance and complete our learning tasks. Our lives have improved, and each of us can receive 60,000 to 70,000 yuan in people's scholarships every month; except for pocket money, we save it all up. This year, the motherland is going to carry out large-scale construction work. I suggest that the Central People's Government issue "Five-Year Plan Bonds" as soon as possible so that our people across the country can invest their savings in the construction cause and promote national construction more quickly.
                 (II)
    Feng Renjie, a reader from Tianshui County, Gansu Province, wrote: The beginning of the motherland's large-scale construction work has brought me good hope. The old society tortured me into a disappointed and passive person; after liberation, the new atmosphere of the motherland made my life full of confidence and hope again. The bright future of the motherland is also my bright future. I must dedicate my strength to the construction of the motherland, first of all, I must use the 500,000 yuan I saved last year to purchase public bonds and invest in the construction cause. Although the amount of money is small, it represents my fiery patriotic enthusiasm and my sincere heart of loving Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.
                    (III)
    Liu Shaojun, a reader from Dingxi County, Gansu Province, wrote: I make a living by repairing clocks and watches. This is the first letter I have written to the newspaper in my life. In the past, I did not have a clear understanding of New China; after the "Three-Anti" movement, I truly knew that the Communist Party was working for the welfare of the people. With this understanding, I am determined to contribute my strength to the people's cause. The motherland is going to carry out great construction work, which requires a lot of funds. I can save some money to buy public bonds and invest in the construction cause. Although my strength alone is very small, if all the Chinese people do this under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the help to the construction work of the motherland will definitely be great. It is recommended that the Central People's Government issue public bonds as soon as possible.

### 读者希望中央人民政府及早发行公债加速祖国建设

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者希望中央人民政府及早发行公债加速祖国建设
    编者按：下面摘要发表的，是读者俞祖同等建议中央人民政府早日发行公债，以加速祖国建设工作的来信。我们认为：这几位读者关心国家建设事业的热情是很好的。关于发行公债的问题，中央人民政府财政部薄一波部长已在“关于一九五三年国家预算的报告”中提出：
    “在预算的收入项下有一项公债，将在适当时机发行，由全国职员、工人、农民和工商业者按照自愿原则认购。”
    “让我们志愿军也来协助祖国的经济建设”
                    （一）
    志愿军某部俞祖同来信：我们祖国在毛主席的英明领导下，今年已开始迈入伟大的头一个五年计划了。祖国的建设高潮，大大地鼓舞了我们的斗志。
    我过去是国营企业的职工。家中来信说生活很富裕；我们在朝鲜生活也提高了，每月的技术津贴增多了，节余了很多钱。我们班里，同志们的心坎中有一个共同的要求：希望中央人民政府考虑及早发行建设公债，让我们志愿军也来协助祖国的经济建设。第一期公债我买了二十分，最近我母亲来信说都已获利还本了；她老人家也要求第二期公债赶快发行。
                （二）
    志愿军某部张国璋来信：我是志愿军部队里的一个摄影员。两年多以前，正当祖国边境受到威胁的时候，我跨过鸭绿江到了朝鲜。两年多来，我无时不在怀念着祖国。每当采访归来黑夜间行进在漫长的山路时，我并不感到孤单；一想起祖国在工厂里流汗的工人，淮河两岸丰收的农民，围着红领巾带着笑脸的孩子们，……我的脚步立刻加快了，疲劳和寒冷被忘的一干二净。
    这是所有志愿军战士们共同的心情。不论在阵地上、工作现场或温暖的山洞里，一谈到祖国的一切，同志们的话立时就多起来。从一个针线包谈到荆江分洪，从吃的榨菜扯到成渝铁路，甚至从一根铁丝谈起突飞猛进的鞍钢。祖国的一切成就鼓舞着我们的战斗意志。大家有一个共同的愿望：用所有的力量保卫祖国，并使祖国建设得更好。
    最近我参加部队里的照片评选，有两张作品得了奖金。编辑同志：现在我把这笔钱寄给你们，当祖国开始发行公债的时候，请即设法把这些钱投入祖国经济建设。虽然只有二十六万元，但即使买一些砖或几斤钉子供祖国建设之用，也就达到我衷心的愿望了。
    把我们的积蓄投入国家建设事业中去
                    （一）
    读者杨郁来信：我是哈尔滨外国语专门学校五级六十四班的学生。两年半来在党的教育下，我树立了为人民服务的观点。祖国的成就和远景，在我们每个人心里开花；为祖国而学习已成了我们提高学习成绩、完成学习任务的唯一口号。我们的生活改善了，每人每月都可领到六、七万元的人民助学金；除掉零用外，我们都把它积蓄起来。今年祖国要进行大规模的建设工作，我建议中央人民政府及早发行“五年计划公债”，使我们全国人民能把积蓄下来的钱投到建设事业上去，更快地推动国家建设。
                 （二）
    甘肃天水县读者冯仁洁来信：祖国大规模建设工作的开始给我带来了美好的希望。旧社会把我折磨成一个失望消极的人；解放后祖国的新气象使我的生活重新满怀着信心和希望。祖国的光明前途也就是我的光明前途。我一定要为祖国建设工作献出力量，首先要把我去年节省下来的五十万元钱购买公债，投入建设事业。这笔钱数目虽小，但代表我烈火般的爱国热情，代表着我一颗敬爱毛主席和共产党的忠贞的心。
                    （三）
    甘肃定西县读者刘少钧来信：我是以修理钟表过活的。这是我有生以来写给报社的第一封信。以前我对新中国是认识不清的；经过“三反”运动以后，我真正知道共产党是为人民谋福利的。我有了这样的认识，就决心要为人民的事业拿出力量。祖国要进行伟大的建设工作，就需要大量的资金，我可以节省一些钱来购买公债，投入建设事业。我一个人的力量虽然很小，但全中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下都这样做，对祖国建设工作的帮助一定是很大的。建议中央人民政府早日发行公债。
