Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th (TASS dispatch)

Dear Comrades, Friends!

We, on behalf of our government and our Communist Party, and on behalf of all the Soviet people, have come here to share the deep grief with you and the delegations from other countries—the unfortunate passing away of the great leader of the Czechoslovak people and our dear friend, President of the Czechoslovak Republic and Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Klement Gottwald.

The working people of Moscow and the entire Soviet Union, our Party and government, share with you the profound sorrow at the death of Klement Gottwald.

The death of Klement Gottwald has caused deep grief to the working people of all People's Democratic countries.

This can be seen from the touching fact that government delegations from the People's Republic of China, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have come here to mourn the death of the President of the Czechoslovak Republic. Only a few days ago, Klement Gottwald was with us at the coffin of our teacher and leader, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. As a faithful comrade-in-arms and close friend of the great Stalin, he bid farewell to the leader and teacher together with the Soviet people.

Only a few days later, Klement Gottwald also left us.

We have lost a great leader and faithful son of the Czechoslovak people. A great political activist, the founder of the Czechoslovak People's Democratic State, an outstanding representative of the international workers' movement, a talented student of Lenin, and a comrade-in-arms of the great Stalin has passed away.

Klement Gottwald dedicated his glorious life to the noblest cause in the world—the cause of liberating the working people from the shackles of capitalism. He steered the Czechoslovak Communist Party and confidently led the party towards the great goal—towards communism—for nearly twenty-five years.

His great work is of incalculable significance. The party he cultivated and the Czechoslovak people under the leadership of this party have not tarnished the banner of freedom and independence, and have gloriously passed many severe tests. They never ceased their heroic struggle during the difficult and dark years of the fascist occupation: to restore the independence of their country, and to unite all the forces of Czechoslovakia in this sacred struggle.

Under the leadership of Klement Gottwald, the working people of Czechoslovakia established a people's democratic system. They successfully crushed the reactionaries' plot to bring the country back to the capitalist road. Thanks to this historic victory, Czechoslovakia's people's democratic system has been further consolidated.

Relying on friendship with the Soviet Union and other countries of the People's Democratic camp, Czechoslovakia is advancing along the road of socialist construction.

All of Klement Gottwald's political activities always proceeded from the interests of the people. He wholeheartedly cared about strengthening the national power of free and independent Czechoslovakia and about improving the material and cultural well-being of the masses. On his initiative and under his leadership, the first five-year plan for developing Czechoslovakia's national economy—a plan for building the material and technical foundations of socialism—was formulated and adopted. The people called this plan the Gottwald Five-Year Plan.

As the Supreme Commander of the Czechoslovak Armed Forces, Klement Gottwald tirelessly cared about strengthening the army and enhancing national defense capabilities. The Czechoslovak army, personally nurtured by Klement Gottwald, has grown into a well-organized and powerful force, ready at any time to defend its homeland.

We have now lost Klement Gottwald, such an enthusiastic banner-bearer of peace and a political activist who has always been unswerving in defending the cause of peace. Under his leadership, Czechoslovakia has consistently pursued a policy of maintaining peace, consolidating peace, and opposing the launching of new wars, and a policy of international cooperation. In his last radio address in Prague before going to Moscow on March 7, Klement Gottwald said: Czechoslovakia must continue to strive to maintain peace and consolidate peace, and raise this banner even higher. Today, Klement Gottwald has passed away, and these words have become his will.

Dear Comrades, Friends!

Klement Gottwald tirelessly called on the Czechoslovak people to maintain and strengthen friendship with the Soviet Union. He said that he considered strengthening this friendship the main thing in his life. With his active participation, the Treaty of Alliance between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union was signed as early as during the war. He regarded the close alliance and unbreakable friendship of our brotherly nations as a reliable guarantee for the independence and prosperity of the Czechoslovak Republic.

Klement Gottwald's historically significant call, "Forever with the Soviet Union," has become the banner of the Czechoslovak people in their struggle for a bright future.

The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union highly value Klement Gottwald's lofty activities in promoting and strengthening Czechoslovakia. They deeply respect him because of his loyalty to the interests of the working people, his loyalty to the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, and his efforts to strengthen friendship with the Soviet Union. Therefore, today, all the Soviet people, together with the Czechoslovak people, lower their flags before the coffin of their dear friend.

The death of Klement Gottwald is a heavy loss for all progressive mankind. We know that this loss is particularly great and heavy for the people of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia. But Klement Gottwald has left the Czechoslovak people a great legacy—the Communist Party, which has been tempered in battle, will confidently lead the Czechoslovak people forward on the road of socialist construction.

What Klement Gottwald said at the time of the death of the great Stalin will become an immortal testament to the working people of Czechoslovakia.

Klement Gottwald said: "Comrade Stalin often taught us that under no circumstances should we be discouraged, nor should we lose our minds. Therefore, we carry out Stalin's behests, raise the banner of Lenin and Stalin even higher, and resolutely advance along the path pointed out to us by Stalin, along the path of building socialism in our country, and along the path of struggle to defend and consolidate peace."

The people of Czechoslovakia, having united even more closely around the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and their government, and strengthening their fraternal friendship with the Soviet Union, will surely achieve new successes in consolidating their people's democratic state and solving the tasks before us.

In these sorrowful, heavy days, dear comrades, friends, you are not alone. With you are the powerful Soviet people, the great Chinese people, the working people of the People's Democratic countries, and all progressive mankind. This camp of democracy and socialism is being consolidated day by day. This camp is united by unbreakable friendship, which our leader and teacher, the great Stalin, and his faithful student and comrade-in-arms, Klement Gottwald, put much effort to strengthen.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government and the entire Soviet people will tirelessly strengthen the friendship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, support and assist the Czechoslovak people in socialist construction.

Comrades, our friendship is solid and unbreakable. No one, at any time, can destroy or shake our friendship.

The glorious and lofty image of Klement Gottwald, an outstanding revolutionary, a courageous fighter for the happiness of mankind, and one of the brilliant leaders of our era, the era of Lenin and Stalin, will live in our hearts and in the hearts of future generations!

Eternal glory to Klement Gottwald, the great leader of the Czechoslovak people!

    在哥特瓦尔德总统追悼大会上
    苏联代表团团长布尔加宁的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我们代表我们的政府和我们的共产党，代表全体苏联人民，到你们这里来和你们以及其他国家的代表团共同分担深切的悲痛——捷克斯洛伐克人民伟大的领袖和我们亲爱的朋友、捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统和捷克斯洛伐克共产党主席克利门特·哥特瓦尔德不幸逝世了。
    莫斯科和苏联全国的劳动人民，我们的党和政府跟你们一起，对克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的逝世感到深切的悲痛。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的逝世使得各人民民主国家的劳动人民感到深深的悲痛。
    这可以由下面感人的事实看出来：到这里来哀悼捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统逝世的有：中华人民共和国、波兰、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国等国的政府代表团。不过在几天以前，克利门特·哥特瓦尔德还和我们一起在我们的导师和领袖约瑟天·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林的灵柩前，他作为伟大的斯大林的忠实的战友和亲近的朋友，和苏联人民一起与领袖和导师告了别。
    只不过几天之后，克利门特·哥特瓦尔德也离开我们了。
    我们失去了捷克斯洛伐克人民的伟大的领袖和忠实的儿子。伟大的政治活动家、捷克斯洛伐克人民民主国家的奠基者、国际工人运动卓越的代表、列宁的天才学生和伟大的斯大林的战友逝世了。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德把自己光辉的一生贡献给世界最崇高的事业——把劳动人民从资本主义桎梏下解放出来的事业。他为捷克斯洛伐克共产党掌舵，满怀信心地领导着党走向伟大的目的——走向共产主义，差不多有二十五年了。
    他的伟大的劳动有不可估量的意义。他所培养起来的党和这个党所领导的捷克斯洛伐克人民没有玷辱自由和独立的旗帜，光荣地通过了许多严重的考验。他们在法西斯占领的艰苦和阴暗的年代里没有一天停止过英勇的斗争：为恢复自己国家的独立，并把捷克斯洛伐克全国的力量团结到这一神圣的斗争中。
    捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民在克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的领导下建立了人民民主制度。他们成功地粉碎了反动派想使国家重新走上资本主义道路的阴谋。由于这一历史性的胜利，捷克斯洛伐克的人民民主制度更加巩固了。
    捷克斯洛伐克依靠与苏联及人民民主阵营其他国家的友谊，沿着社会主义建设的道路前进。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的全部政治活动总是从人民的利益出发。他一心一意地关怀加强自由、独立的捷克斯洛伐克的国力，关怀人民群众物质和文化福利的提高。根据他的创议和在他的领导下制订并通过了第一个发展捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的五年计划——建设社会主义物质和技术基础的计划。人民把这一计划称为哥特瓦尔德五年计划。
    作为捷克斯洛伐克武装部队的最高统帅，克利门特·哥特瓦尔德，不倦地关心加强军队和增强国防力量。克利门特·哥特瓦尔德亲自抚育出来的捷克斯洛伐克军队已长大成为一支很有组织的、强大的力量了，它随时准备保卫自己的祖国。
    我们现在丧失了克利门特·哥特瓦尔德这样一个热情的和平旗手和始终不渝地保卫和平事业的政治活动家。捷克斯洛伐克在他的领导下，一贯地执行维护和平、巩固和平的政策，反对发动新战争的政策，国际合作的政策。克利门特·哥特瓦尔德三月七日去莫斯科以前，在布拉格发表的最后一次广播演说讲道：捷克斯洛伐克今后一定为维护和平、巩固和平而奋斗，并更高地举起这面旗帜。今天，克利门特·哥特瓦尔德已经去世了，这些话就成了他的遗嘱。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德曾不倦地号召捷克斯洛伐克人民保持和加强与苏联的友谊。他曾说，他认为加强这种友谊是他一生中主要的事情。在他的积极参加下，早在战争时期就签订了捷苏同盟条约。他就是把我们兄弟民族的紧密同盟和牢不可破的友谊，看成是捷克斯洛伐克共和国独立和繁荣的可靠保证。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德具有历史意义的号召“永远跟苏联在一起”已成为捷克斯洛伐克人民为争取自己光辉的前途而斗争的旗帜。
    苏联各族人民对克利门特·哥特瓦尔德提高和加强捷克斯洛伐克的崇高的活动评价很高。他们十分尊敬他，因为他忠于劳动人民的利益、忠于列宁、斯大林的学说，努力加强与苏联的友谊。因此今天全体苏联人民与捷克斯洛伐克人民一道在他们的亲爱的朋友的灵柩前垂下自己的旗帜。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的逝世是全体进步人类的沉重损失。我们知道，这个损失对于捷克斯洛伐克的各族人民尤其巨大而沉重。但是克利门特·哥特瓦尔德给捷克斯洛伐克人民留下了伟大的遗产——在战斗中久经锻炼的共产党，这个党将满怀信心地率领捷克斯洛伐克人民在社会主义建设的道路上前进。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德在伟大的斯大林逝世的时候所说的话，将成为对捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的不朽的遗训。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德说道：“斯大林同志经常教导我们，无论在任何情况之下，都不应当沮丧，都不应当失掉理智。因此，我们执行斯大林的遗训，要更高地举着列宁—斯大林的旗帜，并坚决沿着斯大林所指给我们的道路、沿着在我国建设社会主义的道路、沿着维护和巩固和平的斗争道路前进。”
    捷克斯洛伐克的人民已经更紧密地团结在捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会和自己政府的周围，加强着和苏联的兄弟友谊，因此，在巩固自己人民民主国家和解决我们面前的任务方面一定会取得新的成就。
    在这些悲痛的、沉重的日子里，亲爱的同志们、朋友们，你们并不是孤独的。和你们在一起的有强大的苏联人民、伟大的中国人民、人民民主国家的劳动人民和全体进步人类。这个民主和社会主义阵营日益巩固着。这个阵营是被牢不可破的友谊团结在一起的，我们的领袖和导师伟大的斯大林与他的忠实学生和战友克利门特·哥特瓦尔德为了加强这种友谊，出了许多力量。
    苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联政府、全体苏联人民今后将不倦地加强苏联和捷克斯洛伐克之间的友谊，支援和帮助捷克斯洛伐克人民从事社会主义建设。
    同志们，我们的友谊是巩固的、牢不可破的。无论什么人在什么时候都不能破坏或动摇我们的友谊。
    卓越的革命家、为人类幸福奋斗的勇敢战士、我们时代、列宁斯大林时代光辉的领导者之一克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的光辉而崇高的形象，将活在我们的心中和后代的心中！
    捷克斯洛伐克人民的伟大领袖克利门特·哥特瓦尔德永垂不朽！
                    （新华社据塔斯社布拉格二十日电）
