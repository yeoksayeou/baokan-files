Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th: The Soviet newspaper *Pravda* published an editorial on the 28th, commenting on the Decree of Amnesty issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The editorial stated that this decree is a document of great national importance and extremely high political significance. The editorial pointed out that this decree is a testament to the great vitality of the Soviet system and the further consolidation of the socialist state.

The editorial said: The enhancement of citizens' awareness and their faithful attitude in fulfilling their civic duties are most vividly demonstrated by the fact that millions of Soviet people, the vast majority of society, strictly abide by the laws of the socialist state and dedicate all their strength to further strengthening our great motherland. The Soviet people spare no effort in engaging in communist construction. They consider labor a matter of honor and glory, a heroic act of courage. The tried and tested communist method in construction—socialist competition—has become an element of our life. In all aspects of life and work, more and more examples are emerging, proving the creative initiative shown by the working people in ensuring the continuous development and improvement of socialist production at a high technical level. The Party and the government cherish the patriotic behavior of the Soviet people and encourage them in every possible way. In the post-war years alone, more than 1,346,000 workers, collective farmers, scientists, engineers, technicians, staff, doctors, teachers, and others have received Soviet orders and medals.

The material welfare of the Soviet people, their daily life, and their cultural level are constantly improving. The highest principle of the Communist Party and the Soviet government is to always pay attention to maximizing the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the Soviet people. Our country has no exploitation and unemployment that plague the working people. The socialist system guarantees the opportunity for millions of people to unleash their creative initiative.

All this has greatly reduced criminal activity in our country and has made it possible for citizens who had previously committed crimes against the state and society to return to honest labor and useful social activities.

The editorial concluded: The point in the amnesty decree regarding the necessity to revise the Soviet criminal law is of great principle significance. This proves the further development of the main functions of our state, namely, the economic-organizational and cultural-educational functions. This makes it the responsibility of our Party, trade unions, youth leagues, and other public organizations to strengthen their work in educating the masses, to tirelessly and persistently liberate the people's minds from the prejudices and harmful traditions of the old society. All educational work of Party organizations at all levels must continue to cultivate a deep sense of civic duty among the masses, must educate the working people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and concern for the interests of the state, must strengthen state discipline and labor discipline to the maximum extent, and must cultivate respect for Soviet law. The Soviet people will feel a deep sense of patriotic pride in their powerful socialist country, the invincible Soviet social system, and the state system because of the amnesty decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The amnesty decree will arouse among the masses an even more selfless desire to strive for our great motherland.

    真理报论最高苏维埃主席团颁布大赦令
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十八日苏联真理报发表社论，评论苏联最高苏维埃主席团颁布大赦令。社论说这个法令是具有巨大的国家重要性和极高政治意义的文献。社论指出：这个法令是说明苏维埃制度的伟大生命力和社会主义国家的进一步巩固的明证。
    社论说：公民觉悟的提高和他们履行公民义务时的忠实态度由下面的事实最生动地表现出来：千百万的苏维埃人民、社会上绝大多数的人都严格地遵守社会主义国家的法律并且为进一步加强我们的伟大祖国而献出他们的全部力量。苏联人民不遗余力地从事共产主义建设。他们认为劳动是一种名誉和光荣的事，是一种英雄主义的勇敢行为在建设方面历试不爽的共产主义方法——社会主义竞赛，已经成为我国生活中的要素。在生活和工作的各个方面，涌现出越来越多的事例，证明劳动人民为了保证在高度的技术水平上不断地发展和改进社会主义生产所表现出来的创造积极性。党和政府非常珍视苏联人民的爱国行为并且用各种办法来鼓励他们。单是战后年代里，就有一百三十四万六千多名工人、集体农民、科学家、工程师、技师、职员、医生、教师和其他的人得到了苏联的勋章和奖章。
    苏联人民的物质福利、他们的日常生活和文化水平不断提高。共产党和苏维埃政府的最高准则就是经常注意使苏联人民的不断增长的物质和文化要求得到最大限度的满足。我国没有折磨劳动人民的剥削和失业。社会主义制度为千百万人民发挥创造积极性提供了保证。
    这一切已使我们国家里的犯罪行为大大减少，并且使以前曾对国家和社会犯有罪行的公民有可能重新进行诚实的劳动和有用的社会活动。
    社论最后说：大赦令上关于有必要修改苏联刑法的一点是具有巨大的原则意义的。这一点证明了我们的国家的主要职能，即经济—组织和文化—教育工作的职能有了进一步的发展。这使我们的党、工会、青年团和其他公众团体有责任加强它们教育群众的工作，不倦地、坚持不渝地使人民的心灵从旧社会的偏见和有害的传统中解放出来。各级党组织的一切教育工作都必须继续在群众中培养深切的公民义务感，必须以苏维埃爱国主义的精神和关心国家利益的精神教育劳动人民，必须把国家纪律和劳动纪律加强到最大限度和培养对苏维埃法律的尊重。苏联人民将因苏联最高苏维埃主席团的大赦令，而对他们强大的社会主义国家、无敌的苏维埃的社会制度和国家制度深深感到爱国主义的自豪，大赦令将在群众中激起更加忘我地为我们伟大的祖国而努力的愿望。
