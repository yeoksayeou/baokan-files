Their Minimum Demands Should Be Met
Yong Jin

Under the leadership of local cadres, the workers in the Yichun Forestry Area have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and are working hard to complete the timber production tasks assigned to them by the state. The Youth Work Team of the Cuiluan Sub-bureau successfully completed its work tasks last year without any accidents or damage to tools. The workers at the Xiying Nursery Station of the Wudaoku Sub-bureau planted 150,000 trees in one year, with a survival rate of over 85%. They cleared the forest in the harsh winter to make it easier for young trees to grow. To do more work, they didn't even go home at noon. They buried their steamed buns in the snow to keep them from freezing. When they were thirsty, they opened ice holes and drank clear spring water or ate snowballs. The workers are extremely enthusiastic about their work. They smile when they see the small red pines growing in the snow because they planted them with their own hands.

However, the living conditions of the workers in the Youth Work Team and the Xiying Nursery Station are very poor. This is because the leading cadres have adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards their lives. The houses where the Youth Work Team workers live are low and dirty. More than 100 people live in a room with only two small doors and four holes. The smell inside is terrible. According to the work team leader and the workers, they live in such houses because there is "no other way": first, the conditions are too poor, the houses are too small, and the regulations do not allow the use of planks to pave the floor, so the ground is full of mud and the smell is foul; second, the work team leader and the workers work, study, and hold meetings every day, and have no time to clean; third, the most important reason is that the leading cadres of the work area and sub-bureau believe that completing the task is good, exceeding the task is even better, and the workers' lives are secondary.

The workers at the Xiying Nursery Station told me that they have not eaten vegetables for two months, and even salt is lacking. In fact, they can grow vegetables locally. In a work area, I saw a good vegetable garden deep in the dense forest, where the Chinese cabbage, carrots, and scallions were even larger than those outside the forest area. But the head of the Xiying Nursery Station (who is also the Party branch secretary) said: We didn't think of this. He also said: Workers eat salted vegetables, half a jin per person per meal, and meat, two jin per person per meal. He also said: You can't buy anything even if you have money. But this is not true, because the Wudaoku Sub-bureau cooperative sells salted vegetables. The main reason is that the station head only knows how to call on the workers to complete the task and does not care about the workers' lives.

I lived in the logging team of the Miaoling Work Area for a few days. A group of workers surrounded me, holding a woman's cotton trousers, and said: Comrade, look at our "cadre uniform." The cotton trousers we workers received this year are like this. These trousers are too thin and small. If you squat down, they will tear. It is really inconvenient to relieve oneself. The shoes they wear are too small and narrow, and you can't put wula grass in them, so your feet easily get frostbitten. There is also a lack of doctors here. They pointed to a worker who was sick and said: No one cares when you get sick. The leading cadres of the Yichun Administration Bureau also often go down to inspect work, but they rarely care about the workers' lives.

The problems mentioned above are the minimum demands of the workers' lives. As long as the leading cadres of the Yichun Administration Bureau pay attention, they can be solved. They should not only care about the small bridges painted green in Yichun and the wooden fences painted green on the sports field, but also care about the houses in the work areas and work teams. They should transport vegetables to the workers and not let them rot beside the station but deliver them to the workers' hands.

The large-scale national economic construction has brought greater tasks to the Yichun Administration Bureau. Therefore, solving the above problems is even more important. The current situation is that a large number of workers are flowing into the forest area, while a large number are flowing out. Many people do not have long-term plans to work in the forest area, which is largely related to the lack of attention to workers' lives. The workers' demands are not high. The leading organs and leading cadres of the Yichun Forestry Area should meet their minimum demands.

    应该答复他们的起码要求
    勇进
    伊春林区的工人在当地干部领导下，发挥高度的积极性，努力完成国家交付给他们的木材生产任务。翠峦分局的青年工队，在去年一年内，圆满地完成了工作任务，而且没有发生事故，也没有损坏一件工具。五道库分局的西营抚育站的工人，一年中种树十五万株，成活率在百分之八十五以上。他们在严寒的冬天清理林场，以便使幼树容易生长。他们为了多做工作，在中午都不回家。他们怕馒头冻硬了，就埋在雪里。他们渴了，就打开冰眼喝点清泉，或者吃个雪团。工人们对自己的工作是极热情的。他们看着在雪地里生长的小红松就笑起来，因为那是他们亲手栽活的。
    但是，青年工队和西营抚育站工人们的生活却是很不好的。这是因为领导干部对于他们的生活采取了官僚主义的态度。青年工队的工人们住的房子又低又脏，一百多人住的一个房屋里，只有两个小门和四个窟窿。屋里气味很坏。据工队长和工人说，住这种房子是因为“没办法”：第一、条件太差，房子太小，按制度不许用板子铺地，因此地上满是污泥，臭气难闻；第二、工队长和工人每天工作、学习、开会，没有时间搞卫生；第三、最主要的原因是作业所、分局的领导干部认为完成任务就好，超额完成任务更好，工人生活是次要问题。
    西营抚育站工人对我说，他们已经两个月没有吃菜了，甚至也没有盐吃。实际上他们完全可以就地种菜。我在一个作业所里，看到密林深处有一块很好的菜园，那里的大白菜、红萝卜、大葱，比林区外面的长得还大。但西营抚育站长（也是党支部书记）却说：我们没有想到这个。他还说：工人吃咸菜，每人每顿要吃半斤，吃肉，每人每顿要吃二斤。他又说：有钱也买不到东西呀。但这不是事实，因为五道库分局合作社里就有咸菜卖。主要原因还是这个站长只知道号召工人去完成任务，不关心工人生活。
    我在庙岭作业所的采伐工队里住了几天。一伙工人围着我，拿着一条女人棉裤，说：同志，你看俺这“干部服”。我们工人今年发的都是这样的棉裤。这裤子又瘦又小，你蹲下来，它就烂了；大小便真不方便。他们穿的鞋子又小又瘦，鞋子里不能放靰鞡草，很容易冻脚。这里也缺乏医生。他们指着一个病倒的工人说：病了就没人管。伊春管理局的领导干部也经常到下面检查工作，但是他们很少关心工人们的生活。
    上面提出的这些问题，都是工人们对生活的最低的要求，只要伊春管理局领导干部加以注意，是有可能解决的。他们不但要关心伊春的用绿漆漆了的小桥，运动场上用绿漆漆了的木栅，更应该关心作业所、工队的房屋。他们应该给工人运去蔬菜，并且不要堆在车站旁烂掉，而要运到工人的手里。
    国家大规模的经济建设，给伊春管理局带来了更大的任务。因此，解决上面的问题就更加重要了。目前的情况是大批工人流向林区，同时又大批地向外流出。有很多人在林区工作没有长远的打算，这和不注意工人生活是有很大关系的。工人的要求并不高，伊春林区的领导机关和领导干部应当答复他们起码的要求。
