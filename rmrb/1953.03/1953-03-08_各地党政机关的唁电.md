Dear comrades, please accept our deepest condolences in these times of utmost sorrow.
    Comrade Stalin's name is the banner of victory for the liberation of all mankind. He inherited and developed the ever-victorious theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. He led the Soviet people to successfully build a socialist society and began large-scale communist construction. During the Second World War, he commanded the powerful Soviet army to defeat the fascist bandits. His creative theories and his cordial concern for the Chinese people's revolution and national construction will always be our indestructible and invincible weapons, and will always be the greatest encouragement for us to move from victory to victory. We will study and understand the communist theories developed by Comrade Stalin with redoubled efforts, and under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the CPC, we will forever unite closely with the great party of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet people, redouble our efforts, and bravely advance towards our common great cause.

Condolence Message from the Ethnic Minority Staff Members of the Southwest Nationalities Affairs Committee and the Chongqing Office of the Panchen Lama of Tibet to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union:

    Just as we learned of the news that our benefactor—the great leader of the working people of the world and the dearest friend and teacher of the people of all nationalities, Marshal Stalin—was ill, and we were anxiously concerned about his health, hoping for his recovery, we suddenly heard the news of Comrade Stalin's unfortunate passing. We are heartbroken and crying, even more saddened than if we had lost our parents. We recognize that the victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from Comrade Stalin's guidance and assistance. In particular, the ethnic policies formulated by Chairman Mao according to the principles of Comrade Stalin's theory on ethnic issues have enabled us to change from a state of poverty, backwardness, and suffering from exploitation and oppression to a state of happiness. We are eternally grateful. We vow to unite more closely around Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party in the future, study and work better, turn grief into strength, and strive for the cause of peace for all mankind to commemorate the great Comrade Stalin. Comrade Stalin will always live in our hearts!
