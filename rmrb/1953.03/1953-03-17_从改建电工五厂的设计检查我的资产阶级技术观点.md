As an engineer in the Design Department of the Northeast Electrical Appliance Industry Administration Bureau, the redesign I supervised for the Fifth Electrical Engineering Factory contained many errors. For two years, this has seriously hindered the progress of factory construction and wasted a large amount of national investment. Upon reflection, the main reason is that I still retained a bourgeois technical viewpoint and lacked understanding of the political and economic significance of factory design work.

First, I did not recognize that basic construction is a major undertaking for the country’s long-term future and must be considered comprehensively and with a long-term perspective. Instead, I mistakenly focused only on immediate convenience, emphasizing that in the early stages of industrial construction, standards could not be too high. As it was my first time doing factory design, I had to “make do” and get the factory up and running before worrying about other things. This led to a "make it work" mentality, and the overall design was not carefully considered. For example, in the technical design phase, only the production workshop was designed, and no technical design was done for public utilities and power. Because of this lack of overall design, the actual steam consumption was unknown. As a result, a boiler room was built in the first year, but the steam was insufficient. In the second year, another boiler room of the same size was built, and perhaps a third will be needed in the future. This not only increases the investment by several hundred million yuan compared to building one large building to house three boilers, resulting in unnecessary waste, but also increases production costs due to the increased manpower required during use. Similarly, the water source size was not determined. Initially, it was thought that the existing two wells would be sufficient, but it turned out that they were not. Last year, it was necessary to add an additional plan to drill another deep well.

Second, my sense of responsibility was weak, and I blindly designed without complete original data. Before the design, not only was a comprehensive survey not conducted, but even the factory structure and underground pipelines were not investigated. I mistakenly believed that factory design, especially the design of改造厂, mainly involved arranging the machines well so that there were no problems in production, and that other aspects such as ventilation, drainage, and heating were only secondary and didn't matter much if they were a little off.

As a result, because I didn't investigate the hidden underground works, when installing the high-voltage cable, I encountered an impassable underground ditch and had to temporarily modify the design and change the route. As a result, the cable was more than two hundred meters longer than the original design. The structure of the old factory building was also not investigated. I didn't know that there was a crane inside the factory building. As a result, after the steam pipes for the warm air were installed, the crane could not be started, so I had to remove it and modify it. The drainage system was not investigated at all. I thought that since this was an old factory, the original sewer should be usable, so I didn't design it. But in fact, the entire factory's sewer had been in disrepair for many years and had lost its drainage function. Whenever it rained heavily, the area around each factory building was flooded, and traffic was cut off. There are many other similar examples. Why did the above errors occur? Mainly because our sense of responsibility was not strong. We thought that investigating the old factory was very troublesome and time-consuming, so we rashly designed it blindly based on our subjective imagination.

When we designed the production workshop, we also showed an irresponsible attitude in handling the original data. For example, if some product parts were missing drawings or work quotas, we would estimate based on experience. When providing the electricity, water, steam, and gas consumption required by the production equipment, although we lacked appropriate reference materials (such as machine equipment product catalogs), we did not make an effort to study and find more reliable basis subjectively, but also estimated based on imagination. When estimating, we were afraid that it would not be enough in the future, so we generally estimated too high. As a result, the basis for the power design was very conservative. In addition, the backward design method of "Westinghouse" company was adopted, resulting in the capacity of the power system far exceeding the actual needs. For example, the power bus bars in each workshop of the entire factory are not only too abundant at present, but also sufficient even if the output is increased by two or three times in the future.

Third, technical conservatism caused waste. Due to the deep influence of bourgeois ideology, I could not accept the advanced technical achievements of the Soviet Union at that time. I could not see the endless creative power and wisdom of the working class of New China, and blindly worshipped the backward and conservative technical level of the American "Westinghouse" company. For example, when determining the usable area of ​​the factory building, I was satisfied with reaching the quota of "Westinghouse" company, which produced 60 kVA transformers per square meter per year, and did not dare to adopt the Soviet Union's advanced quota of 250 kVA. The facts now prove that this factory can reach 60 kVA per square meter per year in one year. In three to five years, when the technical proficiency of the workers is further improved, the output can be doubled without increasing equipment or workers.

When deciding on machine equipment, it also showed a serious conservative viewpoint, not considering saving national investment, and one-sidedly pursuing complete varieties and quantities. For example, when designing the assembly workshop, it was originally proposed to have 50 large and small winding machines, 12 various shears, 3 horizontal vacuum tanks, and 1 vertical vacuum tank. After review by Soviet experts, the winding machines were reduced to 24, the shears were changed to 8, and only 3 vacuum tanks were needed in total. These alone saved more than 3 billion yuan in equipment investment. In the design of the testing workshop, we originally adopted backward testing equipment and conservative testing methods. After consulting Soviet experts, we changed to using advanced Soviet technology and methods, which reduced the area of ​​the testing workshop by 40%. There are too many similar examples. Without the guidance of Soviet experts, our factory design would have been even worse.

Fourth, the design quality was poor, which affected the construction. Because the construction drawings were drawn too rough, it caused a lot of difficulties for the construction. For example, the large ditch in the fourth workshop did not have direction symbols on the construction drawings, and the construction workers could not understand it and reversed the direction. As a result, the constructed ditch was moved and did not meet the original requirements. On the installation drawing of the power bus bar, only the height of the bus bar was indicated, and no other relevant dimensions were written. The construction workers could not prepare in advance and had to match it according to the pillars, wasting a lot of manpower and extending the construction period by more than two months. Another example is the construction drawing for installing high-voltage cables, which only shows a single line, indicating the approximate location and number, but does not explain how the cables should be arranged, how to bury them, or how to protect them. The construction site could not proceed with the drawings, so they came to the original designer again. The original designer emphasized that the construction unit should have the correct technology for installing cables, and did not provide additional construction instructions and detailed drawings. After repeated negotiations, there were no results. As the construction date approached, the workers relied on their old experience to do it, resulting in more than 300 meters of large cable trenches being built, wasting several billion yuan.

Our erroneous design ideas have caused undue losses to the country, and the lessons are very painful. In the future, I must strive to improve my class consciousness, resolutely overcome bourgeois technical viewpoints, resolutely learn advanced Soviet science and technology, and do factory design with a highly responsible spirit and a serious and conscientious attitude.

    从改建电工五厂的设计检查我的资产阶级技术观点
    东北电器工业管理局设计处工程师　李子白
    我所主持的改建电工五厂的设计错误很多，两年来，严重地阻碍了建厂工作的进行，并且浪费了国家大量的投资。检讨起来，主要是我还保留着资产阶级技术观点，对工厂设计工作的政治、经济意义缺乏认识。
    第一，我没有认识到基本建设是国家的百年大计，必须全面考虑，从长远着想，而错误地只顾当时方便，强调在工业建设初期，水平不可能太高，第一次做工厂设计，只好“将就”点，先把工厂搞起来能生产再讲，因而产生“凑合”思想，设计时就不周密考虑整体设计。例如在技术设计阶段，仅做了生产车间的设计，没有做公用、动力方面的技术设计。由于这方面缺少整体设计，不知道蒸汽的确实用量，因而第一年盖了一座锅炉房，结果蒸汽不够用，第二年又盖了一个同样大小的锅炉房，将来也许还要盖第三个。这样不仅比盖一座容纳三个锅炉的大建筑要增加好几亿元的投资，造成无谓的浪费，而且在使用中由于用人多也增加了生产成本。同样，水源大小也没有确定，当初以为旧有的两眼水井够用，但事实证明了并不够用，去年不得不临时追加计划，再凿一眼深水井。
    第二，责任心不强，原始资料不全就盲目设计。设计之前不仅没有进行全面勘测，连厂房结构，地下管道也没有调查。我当时错误地认为工厂设计，尤其是改造厂的设计，主要是把机器布置好，生产上不发生问题便行，其他各项如通风，下水，取暖等等，仅是从属的，差一点也不要紧。
    结果由于没有调查地下隐藏工程，安装高压电缆时，碰上地沟走不通，只好临时修改设计，变更路线，结果电缆线较原设计加长了两百多公尺。对旧有厂房的结构也没有调查过，不知道厂房里面有一台吊车，结果把暖风的蒸汽管路装上后，吊车就不能开动，只好拆下来改装。对下水系统更没有调查，认为这是旧厂子，原有的下水道应该好用，便没有做设计，但事实上全厂下水道年久失修，已失去排水作用，一到大雨天各厂房周围全是积水，交通都断绝了。其他类似的例子很多。为什么会造成以上的错误呢？主要是由于我们责任心不强，认为调查旧厂十分麻烦，太费时间，只草率地凭着个人主观想像，就盲目地设计了。
    我们做生产车间设计时，在处理原始资料问题上，同样表现了不负责的工作态度。例如某些产品零件没有图，或缺工时定额，我们就凭经验来估计。在提供生产设备需要的电力、水量、蒸气量和煤气用量时，我们虽然缺少适当的参考资料（如机器设备的产品目录等），但主观上也没有努力钻研，找出比较可靠的根据，也是凭想像估计。估计时怕将来不够，一般都估得过高，因而动力设计的根据数字便很保守，再加上又采用了“西屋”公司的落后设计方法，结果使动力系统的容量大大超过实际需要。例如全厂各车间的电力母线，不仅目前过于富裕，即使将来产量提高两三倍后，还能足足够用。
    第三，技术上保守，造成浪费。由于我深受资产阶级思想的影响，当时不能接受苏联先进技术成就，更看不到新中国工人阶级的无穷尽的创造力量和智慧，盲目崇拜落后的、保守的美国“西屋”公司的技术水平。例如决定厂房使用面积时，满足于达到“西屋”公司的定额，每平方公尺的面积年产六十仟伏安变压器，而不敢采用二百五十仟伏安的苏联先进定额。现在的事实证明，这个工厂一年后便可达到每平方公尺年产六十仟伏安，三五年后，工人的技术熟练程度进一步提高时，不需增加设备，不需增加工人，便可提高产量一倍。
    在决定机器设备时，同样表现着严重的保守观点，不从节约国家投资打算，片面追求品种齐全，数量只怕少不怕多。例如设计装配车间时，最初提出大小绕线机五十台，各式剪床十二台，卧式真空罐三台，立式真空罐一台。经过苏联专家审查后，绕线机减少为二十四台，剪床改为八台，真空罐总共只要三台，仅仅这些便节约了设备投资三十多亿元。试验车间设计，我们原来采用落后的试验设备，保守的试验方法，请教苏联专家后，改用苏联的先进技术和方法，便把试验车间的面积缩小了百分之四十。类似的例子太多了，倘若没有苏联专家的指点，我们的工厂设计更不知要糟到什么程度。
    第四，设计质量低劣，影响了施工，因施工图纸画得太粗糙，给施工造成不少困难。例如第四场房的大地沟因为施工图上没有画出方向符号，施工人员看不懂，把方向弄颠倒了，结果做出来的地沟搬了家，不合原来要求。电力母线安装图上，仅注明母线的高低，而没有写上其他有关的尺寸，施工人员不能事先作准备，只好按照柱子配，浪费大批人工，使工程期限延长两个多月。另如安装高压电缆的施工图上仅画出单线，表明大概位置和根数，而没有说明电缆线应如何排列，如何埋法，如何保护。工地拿到图不能施工，又来找原设计人，原设计人却强调施工单位应该具有正确安装电缆的技术，不给补加施工说明和详图，往返交涉多次，毫无结果。施工日期逼近了，便由工人凭老经验干，结果多做了三百多公尺的大地缆沟，浪费好几亿元。
    我们的错误的设计思想给国家造成了不应有的损失，教训是十分惨痛的。我今后一定要努力提高阶级觉悟，坚决克服资产阶级技术观点，坚决学习苏联的先进科学技术，用高度负责的精神，严肃认真的态度，来做工厂设计。（原载东北日报）
