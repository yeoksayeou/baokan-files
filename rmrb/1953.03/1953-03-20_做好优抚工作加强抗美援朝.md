    Doing a Good Job in Providing Preferential Treatment and Strengthening Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea

    Editor's Note: Around the Spring Festival, we received many letters of慰问 (weiwen) to the Volunteer Army, as well as letters from revolutionary soldiers, families of martyrs, and other readers reporting on the work of the people supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers, and the work of the troops supporting the government and cherishing the people during the Spring Festival. We are now selecting a portion to be published below:

    The Wendeng Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Shandong Writes to the Volunteer Army Reporting on Local Preferential Treatment Work

    The Wendeng Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Shandong Province wrote to the Volunteer Army: The people of the Wendeng area are all thinking of the most beloved people—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—while celebrating the Spring Festival. The fact that the people of our region can happily and diligently work and reap bumper harvests year after year on their own land is inseparable from the heroic defense of the motherland by the Volunteer Army. The broad masses of the people in our area have automatically put forward the guarantee that "the families of martyrs will not lack food or clothing, and everything will be taken care of thoroughly." The method of 代耕 (daigeng - tilling the land on behalf of someone) has generally adopted a fixed system, and the yield of 代耕 land has increased year by year. The lives of the families of martyrs have improved year by year. A number of 代耕 models have emerged throughout the region, and many 代耕 high-yield fields have been created. Last year, the higher-level People's Government allocated more than 7 billion yuan and 300,000 jin of millet to our region to subsidize the families of martyrs who had relatively difficult lives. The Special Zone established a primary school for the children of martyrs, accommodating more than 100 orphans of martyrs; it is planned to continue to expand it next year.

    Chairman Mao is very concerned about the people in the old revolutionary base areas. He distributed social relief grain and funds to the old revolutionary base areas in our region, built many roads, bridges, and check dams, and established two people's hospitals and nineteen district health clinics; and distributed more than 1 billion yuan to families of martyrs for medical treatment, with 2,110 people cured in Rongcheng County alone.

    The broad masses of families of martyrs actively participate in labor, study, and various tasks. There are thousands of models of families of martyrs at all levels in the region, such as Zhang Benzhou in Rongcheng County, Bi Shuzeng in Wendeng County, and Cao Xubao in Kunyu County, all of whom have become model figures loved by the masses and have become leaders leading the masses forward.

    Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative Reports Production Situation to the Volunteer Army

    The Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, wrote to the Volunteer Army: You are fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield, defending the construction and safety of the motherland and the people, and inspiring our production enthusiasm. Last year, our cooperative achieved brilliant results in the patriotic bumper harvest movement: the average yield per mu of land in the whole cooperative was 454 jin, exceeding the highest pre-war yield by 234 jin; increased by 330 sheep and one horse; and also built 9 kiln caves, 10 river dams, and 2 irrigation canals, irrigating 130 mu of land. In the future, we will work even harder to produce, strive for 80% of the land in the whole cooperative to reach the standard of high and bumper yields, and increase production by 80 jin per mu on the basis of last year; at the same time, we must achieve comprehensive development of agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and sideline industries, and support you with greater material resources, financial resources, and human resources to strengthen the struggle against U.S. aggression and aid Korea. All 40 militiamen in the cooperative are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to Korea to fight alongside you. We have also regarded 代耕 work as our glorious task. You can rest assured to kill the enemy, let us work hard together in the front and rear, and make persistent efforts to win greater victories!

    Sending Volunteer Army Uncles the Most Precious Gift

    Ji Ru wrote: I used to be a communications员 (tongxunyuan - communicator) in the Shanxi Provincial Transportation Company, and I was recently transferred to the Jinnan Transportation Branch Company as a trainee. I have long wanted to send Volunteer Army uncles the most precious gift, but my salary can only maintain my personal life. What should I do? I often worry about this. In early December last year, the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea came here to report, and they said that the Volunteer Army uncles regarded letters from the people of the motherland as the most precious thing, read them during rest, and even when fighting, they kept them in their pockets until the words were worn out and they were reluctant to throw them away. Hearing about the Volunteer Army uncles' love for the people of the motherland, I was so moved that I almost shed tears! After I came back, I wrote the most enthusiastic and happiest words in my heart into a letter of慰问 (weiwen), and quickly sent it to the front line in Korea as a gift to the Volunteer Army uncles.

    A Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army Stationed in Qixian County Has Made Remarkable Achievements in Supporting the Government and Cherishing the People

    Cao Lin wrote: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qixian County, Shanxi Province, has made remarkable achievements in supporting the government and cherishing the people. Since the unit was stationed in Qixian County, the work has been tense, but they still often help the families of martyrs and poor peasants in production. Up to now, they have helped the masses cultivate land and harvest crops for more than 1,000 mu, and repaired 3,400 houses; and dug 6 foreign-style wells, solving the drinking water problem for some of the masses. In terms of cultural and recreational life, the unit has successively invited 112,500 government cadres, militiamen, labor models, young students, and people from all walks of life to watch 25 movies, and has also organized more than 120 various cultural and recreational activities and more than 10 military-civilian gatherings. In sanitation work, the unit actively takes the lead in cleaning the streets and alleys and actively catching flies and digging pupae. Individual personnel in the unit occasionally have acts that violate the interests of the masses, and the leading comrades have dealt with them seriously and promptly.

    The unit's actions have been sincerely supported by the local masses. During festivals, local organs, groups, and the people bring a large number of letters of慰问 (weiwen), banners, and慰问 (weiwen) items to congratulate and慰问 (weiwen). Last year, on the "August 1st" Army Day, an old lady of 57 years old came to the troops with a cane to celebrate the festival together.

    Family Member of a Soldier, Dong Guilan, Thanks the Masses for Their慰问 (weiwen) and Is Determined to Devote Her Strength to the Construction of the Motherland

    Dong Guilan wrote: I am a family member of a soldier from Chou Ti Hutong in Beijing. One thing has moved me deeply. A few days before the Spring Festival, the students of Class 2, Grade 4 of Huiwen No. 1 Primary School came to our house and solemnly posted beautiful New Year pictures in the room, and then helped to sweep the snow in the yard. Their hands were frozen red, but they still smiled happily. I asked them to come into the house to warm up by the fire, but they kept saying "not tired, not cold," and went back with a smile after the work was done. Neighbors also sent many gifts to慰问 (weiwen). Our whole family was so moved that we held a family meeting. Everyone said: Our family can be so harmonious and united and receive such glory, entirely because of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Everyone promised to produce and study well, actively participate in social work, and dedicate their strength to the construction of the motherland in order to repay Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the broad masses of people who care about us.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    做好优抚工作加强抗美援朝
    编者按：春节前后，我们收到很多给志愿军的慰问信，以及革命军人、烈军属和其他读者报告春节人民拥军优属工作和部队拥政爱民工作情况的来信。现选择一部分发表于后：
    山东文登专署给志愿军写信报告当地优抚工作情况
    山东省文登专署给志愿军的信：文登专区全体人民在欢度春节时，都想念着最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军。我们全区人民能够在自己的土地上愉快地辛勤劳动，连年丰收，是和志愿军英雄地保卫祖国完全分不开的。我区广大人民自动提出了“使烈军属不缺吃、不缺穿，样样照顾周全”的保证。代耕方法普遍地采用了固定制，代耕土地产量逐年提高。烈军属的生活逐年上升。全区出现了不少代耕模范，创造了不少的代耕丰产田。去年上级人民政府拨给咱区七十多亿元款和三十万斤小米，补助给生活较困难的烈军属。专区成立了一所烈士子女小学，收容无依无靠的烈士子女一百多人；来年还准备继续扩大。
    毛主席十分关心老根据地的人民。他给我区老根据地发放了社会救济粮款，修了不少的公路、桥梁、缓水坝等，还建立了两处人民医院、十九处区卫生所；并发了十多亿元款给烈军属治病，只荣成一县就治好了二千一百十人。
    广大烈军属积极参加劳动、学习和各种工作。全区各级烈军属模范数以千计，像荣成县的张本周、文登县的毕庶增、昆嵛县的曹绪保等都成为受群众爱戴的模范人物，成了领导群众前进的带路人。
    郭玉恩农业生产合作社向志愿军报告生产情况
    山西平顺县川底村郭玉恩农业生产合作社给志愿军的信：你们在朝鲜战场上和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，保卫了祖国建设和人民安全，鼓舞着我们的生产热情。去年我社在爱国丰产运动中获得了辉煌的成果：全社每亩地平均产量四百五十四斤，超过战前最高产量二百三十四斤；增加了三百三十只羊，一匹马；还打窑九孔，垒河坝十条，挖水渠两条，浇地一百三十亩。今后我们更要以最大的努力进行生产，争取全社百分之八十的土地达到高额丰产标准，在去年的基础上每亩增产八十斤；同时要做到农业、牧畜业、林业、副业全面发展，以更大的物力、财力、人力支援你们，加强抗美援朝斗争。全社四十个民兵，早就准备着随时响应祖国召唤，到朝鲜去和你们一起作战。我们并已把代耕工作当成自己的光荣任务。你们安心杀敌吧，让我们前方后方一齐努力，再接再厉争取更大胜利！
    送志愿军叔叔一件最宝贵的礼物
    纪如来信：俺原是山西省运输公司一个通信员，最近调到晋南运输分公司做练习生。俺老早就想送志愿军叔叔一个最宝贵的礼物，可是我的薪金刚能维持个人生活。这怎么办呢？俺常常为这件事着急。去年十二月上旬，中国人民赴朝慰问团到这里来作报告，他们说到志愿军叔叔把祖国人民的来信当成一种最宝贵的东西，休息时看，作战时还看，甚至装在口袋里磨得看不见字了也舍不得扔掉。听到志愿军叔叔这种热爱祖国人民的情形，我感动得快流泪了！回来后俺便把心眼里最热情、最高兴的话写成一封慰问信，赶快送到朝鲜前线去，作为我给志愿军叔叔的礼物。
    驻祁县的人民解放军某部拥政爱民工作有显著成绩
    曹林来信：驻山西祁县的人民解放军某部拥政爱民工作有显著成绩。该部移驻祁县以来，工作紧张，但仍经常帮助烈军属和贫雇农生产。到现在他们已帮助群众耕种土地和收割庄稼一千多亩，修补房屋三千四百间；并打了六个洋水井，为部分群众解决了吃水问题，在文娱生活方面，该部先后请政府干部、民兵、劳动模范、青年学生及各阶层人民群众十一万二千五百人看电影二十五场，还组织了各种文娱活动一百二十多次、军民联欢大会十多次。在卫生工作中，该部积极带头经常把大街小巷打扫得干干净净，并积极捕蝇挖蛹。该部个别人员偶然有违反群众利益的行为，领导同志都及时作了严肃的处理。
    该部这种行动受到当地群众真诚的拥护。每逢节日，当地各机关团体、人民群众都带着大批的慰问信、锦旗和慰问品前来祝贺、慰问。去年“八一”建军节，一个五十七岁的老大娘拄着拐棍来到部队共同欢度节日。
    军属董桂兰感谢群众慰问  决心为建设祖国献出力量
    董桂兰来信：我是北京抽屉胡同的一个军属，有一件事使我深受感动。春节前几天，汇文第一小学四年级二班同学到我们家来，在屋里郑重地贴上了美丽的年画，接着又帮着扫院子里的雪。他们手都冻红了，但仍愉快地笑着。我请他们进屋去烤烤火，他们连说“不累、不冷”，工作做完就笑着回去了。邻居们也送了很多礼物来慰问。我们全家都感动得不得了，开了一个家庭会议。大家都说：我家能够这样和睦团结并且得到这样的光荣，完全是毛主席、共产党给带来的。大家都保证要好好生产、学习，积极参加社会工作，为建设祖国而献出力量，来答谢毛主席、共产党和关怀我们的广大人民。
