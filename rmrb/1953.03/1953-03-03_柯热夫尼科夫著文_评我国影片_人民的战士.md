    Reviewing Chinese Film "People's Warrior"
    The Chinese film "People's Warrior," which won the "Award for the Struggle for Freedom" at the 7th International Film Festival in 1952, has recently been shown in Moscow cinemas after being dubbed into Russian by the Moscow Gorky Film Studio. *Pravda* published a review by Soviet writer Vadim Kozhevnikov, who visited China in 1952, saying: I first saw the film "People's Warrior" when visiting a village not far from Beijing. The audience—hundreds of Chinese farmers—were deeply moved by the story of this film. The history of the protagonists in this film is the history of the lives of millions of Chinese farmers. Kozhevnikov pointed out: Soviet audiences highly appreciate the contributions of the director and screenwriter to this patriotic film, because this film reflects the history of the great Chinese people's heroic struggle for liberation. In the protagonists of this film, we can see the archetype of the people of New China. This film depicts the military ethics, political strength, and heroism of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as the noble qualities of this invincible army that defends peace and the security of the motherland. It strongly expresses the unity of the army and the people. It profoundly reflects the heroism and indomitable fighting spirit of the people who have won a great victory in the liberation struggle and are victoriously defending their freedom and independence. This film depicts the heroic actions of the soldiers and the life of the Chinese People's Liberation Army with extreme realism. Li Changhua, who plays Liu Xing, Liu Xin, who plays Wan Liangcai, and Dudev, who plays Wan Liangcai's father—these talented actors have created vivid and unforgettable characters. Kozhevnikov concluded: "People's Warrior" is a valuable contribution to Chinese cinema and art, which serves the people and inspires them to achieve new victories. (Xinhua News Agency)

    评我国影片“人民的战士”
    在一九五二年第七届国际电影节中曾获得“争取自由斗争奖”的中国影片“人民的战士”，已由莫斯科高尔基电影制片厂用俄语配音，最近在莫斯科电影院放映。真理报特发表一九五二年到过中国访问的苏联作家瓦吉姆·柯热夫尼科夫的一篇评论说：我在访问离北京不远的一个乡村时，第一次看到“人民的战士”这部影片。观众们——几百个中国农民——深为这部影片的故事所激动。这部影片的主角们的历史就是千百万中国农民生活的历史。柯热夫尼科夫指出：苏联的观众们对导演和编剧对这部爱国影片所作的贡献给予很高的评价，因为这部影片反映了伟大的中国人民争取解放的英勇斗争的历史。我们在这部影片主角们的身上，可以看到新中国人民的典型。这部影片描写了中国人民解放军的军事道德、政治力量和英雄主义，以及这支保卫和平和祖国安全的不可战胜的军队的崇高品质。它强烈地表现了军民的团结一致。它深刻地反映了在解放斗争中获得了伟大胜利，并且胜利地保卫了他们的自由独立的人民的英雄主义和百折不挠的战斗勇气。这部影片以极端写实的手法描写了战士的英雄行为和中国人民解放军的生活。饰演刘兴的李长华，饰演万良材的刘欣，饰演万良材父亲的杜德夫——，这些天才演员塑造了生动的、令人不能忘怀的形象。柯热夫尼科夫最后说：“人民的战士”对于为人民服务并鼓舞人民获得新胜利的中国电影和艺术，是一个有价值的贡献。（新华社）
