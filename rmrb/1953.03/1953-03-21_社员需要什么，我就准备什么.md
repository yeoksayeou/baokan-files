    "I prepare whatever the cooperative members need"
    The Fangkuangzi Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Huaide County, Jilin Province, has achieved great success in serving the local farmers' production. On the shelves of the cooperative, you can find everything: rubber-tired wheels costing ten million yuan a pair, flower wheel carts costing several million yuan each, whiplashes costing five hundred yuan apiece, small millstones costing one thousand yuan each, as well as farming tools used for shoveling, hoeing, harvesting, and threshing throughout the year. They can also be supplied promptly according to seasonal needs. The cooperative members praised the cooperative, saying: "Timely supply, low prices; conforming to standards, complete variety."
    
    "Porcelain Plowshares" and "Rolled-Edge Sickles"
    The Fangkuangzi Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative encountered many difficulties when it first started dealing in agricultural tools. At that time, they neither understood quality nor were familiar with specifications. The first batch of plowshares and sickles they processed were of very poor quality. 社员冯海清(Sheyuan Feng Haiqing) bought a plowshare, and it broke into five or six pieces after plowing only two *long*. 社员老程头 (Sheyuan Lao Chengtou) took two broken plowshares to the cooperative and said, "Your plowshares, keep them as 'decorations'! Don't even mention asking for money, we can't even afford to waste our labor on them." The local farmers called this batch of plowshares "porcelain plowshares," and it quickly spread throughout the village. At that time, the cadres of the cooperative were worried when they saw the pile of broken plowshares returned by the members. Cooperative Director Li Yucheng was even more anxious, especially when he saw the farmer members going to the street to buy agricultural tools, he felt very sad. However, the sense of responsibility to the members made him determined: "No matter what difficulties there are, we must meet the needs of the members."
    
    The second time they supplied sickles and hoes, they learned from the previous lesson and signed an oral contract with the blacksmith's shop, but they still couldn't guarantee the quality. The vast majority of the members still went to the street to buy the agricultural tools they needed. This time, the sickles were soft and the steel was not evenly distributed, so after cutting a few times, the blade was notched like a saw. The farmers ridiculed: "Buying a sickle from the cooperative even gives you a saw." Cheng Haiqing of Fangkuangzi Village composed a *kuaiban* (a form of rhythmic storytelling) for the cooperative: "The cooperative's knives don't need to be picked, half of them are cut with the knife, half are pulled by hand, the knife is covered with teeth, be careful not to get bitten." Two failures made the cooperative director lose confidence, so he ran to the Communist Party's district committee to report on this period of work. With the help of the district committee, Li Yucheng realized that the main reason why the work in this stage was not done well was that he didn't know what was going on in his heart and didn't understand the needs of the masses. He made up his mind again: he must do the work well.
    
    Learning from the Farmers
    According to the instructions of the district committee, the cooperative often went deep into the mutual aid groups to understand the needs of the members. Once, Cooperative Director Li Yucheng went to the Li Defu mutual aid group in Houwa Village to understand the situation. The masses criticized him in a mocking tone as "the shopkeeper of a porcelain shop." Li Yucheng humbly accepted their criticism and asked for everyone's opinions: What kind of agricultural tools would be satisfactory? Seeing that he was very humble, everyone put forward their own requirements: some wanted "large-bladed" and sturdy sickles, some wanted "crescent" style sickles, and the general requirement was that they should be both sturdy and fast. Based on these requirements, the cooperative director processed two hundred sickles and signed a contract with the blacksmith shop guaranteeing the quality of "no breaking, no pulling, and no peeling." This batch of sickles was sold out in a few days. Because of the good quality, some mutual aid groups bought them in bundles. From then on, the farmers' impression of the cooperative began to change. The *kuaiban* that the masses had previously composed for the cooperative also changed its lyrics: "The cooperative's knives are of high quality, they don't break, they don't pull, the steel is good, and they are very effective for cutting crops." From this incident, Cooperative Director Li Yucheng deeply realized: "If you don't consult the farmers when serving them, you won't be able to do anything well." Later, when the cooperative entrusted the blacksmith shop to process agricultural tools, they would consult the farmers first. Once, when processing "field hoes," 社员老张头 (Sheyuan Lao Zhangtou) looked at the sample and said: "Lower the ribs on both sides of the back of the hoe, so that it won't stick to the soil even if the ground is wet. Make the 'mud clever back' more bulging, so it can be used for two more years." The hoe made by the cooperative according to his opinion was very popular among the farmers. This lesson from Lao Zhangtou gave Cooperative Director Li Yucheng a great inspiration. He thought: "There are countless people like Lao Zhangtou in the whole village. If we invite these experienced old farmers to the cooperative to hold a few meetings, our cadres will become experts, and we won't have to worry about doing our work well."
    
    Farmers' Symposium
    He thought for several days, and believed that only holding a symposium for old farmers would only solve the problem of specifications and quality of agricultural tools. If representatives of members from each village and workers from the blacksmith shop were called together to hold a meeting, even the plan for the supply of agricultural tools would be solved. As soon as the spring plowing season of 1952 arrived, the cooperative invited seven or eight old farmers, convened representatives of members from each village, and also invited workers from several blacksmith shops and plowshare shops in Huaide Street to jointly hold a meeting. The cooperative director took the "broken plowshares" and "rolled-edge sickles" from last year to the meeting and asked everyone to study and improve them. According to the opinions of the farmers, the samples were redrawn, and the specifications of agricultural tools such as plowshares and small hoes were determined. Everyone's requirements for specifications and quality were consistent, and the representatives then proposed the number of goods they wanted at the meeting, which was more than twice the cooperative's original supply plan. Then, the cooperative signed contracts with four blacksmith shops. Through this symposium method, the quality and specification problems in the supply of agricultural tools, the problem of formulating plans, and the problem of processing and ordering were all solved at once. This kind of symposium later became an important method for the Fangkuangzi Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative to operate small agricultural tools. The old farmers in each village also became the cooperative's "agricultural tool consultants."
    
    Promoting Chemical Fertilizers
    In 1952, the Party called for increasing the yield per unit area, and Cooperative Director Li Yucheng bought five thousand *jin* (a Chinese unit of weight, about 500 grams) of ammonium sulfate (chemical fertilizer) from the county cooperative. However, after promoting it for several days, not even one *jin* was sold. He learned from the mutual aid groups that everyone was afraid of burning the seedlings, afraid of becoming addicted to the land, and afraid that the price was not worthwhile. Lao Li thought, he should still persuade everyone through those old farmers. But this time he ran into a snag. It turned out that these "agricultural tool consultants" had even more concerns about using chemical fertilizers. So he changed his mind and went to Sanhebao Village to mobilize the young farmer Liu Bingde. At that time, Liu Bingde was also skeptical about the effect of ammonium sulfate. Director Li persuaded him to try it in one *long* of his millet field, and the cooperative would not ask him for money first. After a few days, the millet in the *long* where ammonium sulfate was used was more than half a *chi* (a Chinese unit of length, about 33 cm) taller than the millet where ammonium sulfate was not used. Director Li immediately convened a farmers' symposium and invited Liu Bingde to introduce the benefits of using ammonium sulfate at the meeting. After the meeting, he also led everyone to see Liu Bingde's millet field. In this way, all five thousand *jin* of ammonium sulfate were sold out in a few days. Many farmers regretted that they had not bought chemical fertilizers at that time. Now, the cooperative's promotion of chemical fertilizers is no longer a problem; according to statistics, the number of ammonium sulfate needed by farmers in the entire village this year will be nearly 50,000 *jin*, ten times more than in 1952.
    
    Under the leadership of the Party, the Fangkuangzi Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative has closely contacted the members of the community. In this tortuous process, it has finally overcome many difficulties and freed the supply of production materials from a state of losing money and backlog, thereby achieving "timely supply, good quality and low prices," which has been warmly supported by the members of the community.

### “社员需要什么，我就准备什么”

    “社员需要什么，我就准备什么”
    吉林省怀德县房框子屯供销合作社为当地农民生产服务，很有成绩。在合作社的货架子上，一千万元一付的胶轮带，数百万元一台的花轮车，五百元一根的皮鞭梢，一千元一块的小磨石，以及一年四季铲、?、收、打所用的农具，都是应有尽有；且能按照季节需要，及时供应。社员赞美合作社说：“供应及时，价钱低；合规格，货样全。”
    “磁器铧子”和“卷刃镰刀”
    房框子屯供销合作社在开始经营农具的时候，曾遇到很多困难。当时，既不懂得质量，也不熟悉规格。第一次加工的铧子和镰刀质量很坏，社员冯海清把铧子买回去，只?了两垅就碎了五、六瓣。社员老程头拿着两条折了的铧子找到合作社说：“你们这铧子，留着当‘摆设’吧！别说还要钱，就是白给咱也搭不起工。”当地农民都把这批铧子叫做“磁器铧子”，并且很快就传遍了全村。当时合作社的干部一看到那堆被社员退回来的破铧子心里就发愁。合作社主任李玉臣更着急，特别是他看见社员农民到街上买农具的时候，心里很难过。但是，对社员的责任感使他下了决心：“不管有什么困难，我们一定要满足社员的需要。”
    第二次供应镰刀、锄头的时候，接受了上次的教训，跟铁匠炉订了口头合同，但是仍不能保证质量。绝大多数社员还是上街买他们需要的农具。这次的镰刀因为钢软，而且夹的不均匀，割不了几次就把刀刃勒得像锯齿一样了。农民嘲笑说：“买合作社一把镰刀连锯都有了。”房框子屯程海清给合作社编了一个快板：“合作社的刀不用挑，一半用刀割，一半用手薅，刀上长满了牙，小心别咬着。”两次失败使合作社主任心里没了底，便跑到共产党的区委会把这一段的工作进行了汇报。在区委的帮助下，李玉臣认识到这一阶段工作没做好的主要原因是自己心中无数，不了解群众需要。他又下了决心：一定把工作做好。
    向农民请教
    根据区委的指示，合作社经常深入互助组了解社员群众的需要。有一次合作社主任李玉臣到后洼屯李德福互助组去了解情况。群众用嘲笑的口吻批评他是“磁器铺掌柜的”，李玉臣虚心接受了他们的批评，并征求大家意见：什么样的农具才合心？大家看他很虚心，就纷纷提出自己的要求：有的要“大片”结实的镰刀，有的要“月牙”式的镰刀，而总的要求是既要结实又要快。合作社主任根据这些要求，加工了二百把镰刀，并和铁匠炉订了“不勒、不拉、不重皮”的保证质量的合同。这批镰刀办回来不到几天工夫都卖光了。因为质量好，有的互助组就成捆的买。从此农民对合作社的印象开始转变了。群众以前给合作社编的快板也变了词：“合作社的刀，质量高，不勒不拉钢口好，割起庄稼真灵巧。”从这一事件中，合作社主任李玉臣深深体会到：“给农民办事，如果不去请教农民，说啥也办不好。”以后合作社委托铁匠炉加工农具时就先请教农民。有一次加工“地头镐”，社员老张头看了一下样子说：“把镐背两边的楞再矮点，地湿点也不沾土了。‘泥巧背’再鼓一点肚还能多使二年。”合作社按照他的意见打出的镐，很受农民欢迎。老张头这一课，又给合作社主任李玉臣很大启发。他想：“像老张头这样人，全村不知有多少，如果把这些有经验的老农民都请到合作社来开上几个会，我们的干部都变成了内行，就不愁工作搞不好了。
    农民座谈会
    他想了好几天，认为只开老农座谈会，仅解决农具的规格、质量问题，如果召集各屯社员代表和铁匠炉的工人一块开会，就连农具供应的计划问题都解决了。一九五二年春耕一到，合作社便请来七、八个老农民，召集了各屯的社员代表，并把怀德街的几家铁匠炉和铧子炉的工人也找来共同开会，合作社主任把去年的“破铧子”和“卷刃镰刀”拿到会上，请大家研究改进。根据农民的意见，重新画了样子，把铧子、小镐等农具的规格都定下来了。大家对规格、质量的要求一致了，各代表便在会上提出要货数字，结果超过合作社原订供应计划两倍多。然后合作社与四家铁匠炉订了合同。通过这种座谈会的方式，把农具供应工作中的质量、规格问题，制订计划问题，以及加工订货问题一下子都解决了。这种座谈会以后就成了房框子屯供销合作社经营小农具的重要方法。各屯的老农民也成了合作社的“农具顾问”。
    推销化学肥料
    一九五二年党号召提高单位面积产量，合作社主任李玉臣从县社买来五千斤硫安（化学肥料）。可是宣传了好几天，连一斤也没卖出去。他到互助组一了解，原来大家怕烧小苗，怕上馋了地，怕价格不合算。老李心想，还是通过那些老农民说服说服大家。但这次他却碰了一个钉子。原来这些“农具顾问”们，对使用化学肥料顾虑更多。于是他改变了主意，又到三合堡屯去动员青年农民刘秉德。当时刘秉德对硫安的效果也是半信半疑，李主任劝他在谷子地里上一垅试试，合作社先不跟他要钱。过了几天，用了硫安的那条垅的谷子，比没用硫安的高了半尺多。李主任立刻召开了农民座谈会，请刘秉德在会上介绍用硫安的好处，会后又领大家去看刘秉德的谷子地。这样一来，不到几天工夫五千斤硫安全卖光了。很多农民都后悔当时没买化学肥料。现在，合作社推销化学肥料已不成问题；据统计今年全屯农民需要硫安的数量将近五万斤，比一九五二年增加了十倍。
    房框子屯供销合作社在党的领导下，密切联系着社员群众，在这段曲折的过程中，终于战胜许多困难，把生产资料供应工作，从赔钱、积压的状态中，摆脱出来，从而做到了“供应及时，物美价廉”，受到了社员群众的热烈拥护。（吉林日报财经组集体写作）
