【Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th】TASS reported from Moscow: Pravda published an article by Professor Grekov on the 6th entitled "Stalin's Plan to Transform Nature is Underway." The author pointed out that the massive hydropower stations being built by the Soviet people on the Volga, Don, Dnieper, and Amu Darya rivers, namely the Stalinist Communist construction projects, have provided Soviet agriculture with an even more splendid future than before. The arid land irrigated and supplied with water by the equipment of these hydropower stations alone will amount to more than 28 million hectares.

	The grand scale of the land improvement construction projects is a direct result of the vigorous development by the Party, the government, and Stalin himself. The progress of socialist industry in supplying Soviet agriculture with superior equipment, as well as the achievements of collective farms and state farms, have laid the foundation for more extensive land improvement during the Fifth Five-Year Plan. According to the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the area of irrigated land will be increased by 30 to 35 percent, and the area of drained land will be increased by 40 to 45 percent during the five-year period.

	By 1955, the equipment of the Lenin Canal and the Tsimlyansk Reservoir will irrigate 550,000 hectares of land and supply water to 1.1 million hectares of land. In the area of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, a wide range of irrigation systems will be built. About 2,000 sluice gates will be built there to intercept spring floods. A reservoir with a capacity of more than 15 million cubic meters, several pumping stations, and an irrigation network will use water from the Volga River to irrigate the land in the Kuibyshev Oblast.

	During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, construction projects for irrigation and water supply systems will commence in the areas of the Turkmen Main Canal, the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, the South Ukraine Canal, and the North Crimean Canal. All available local irrigation water sources will be utilized first.

	The construction of irrigation systems in important cotton-growing areas such as Central Asia and the Transcaucasus has taken on a particularly large scale. The Fergana Main Canal named after Stalin will be expanded to irrigate the middle reaches of Fergana. In addition to the land irrigated by the Kirov Canal, the Farkhad Dam and Hydroelectric Station built on the Syr Darya River during the Great Patriotic War will irrigate more than 400,000 hectares of land on the Hungry Steppe near the Fergana Basin with gravity canals. The Mingechaur Reservoir, which is being built in the Transcaucasus, will constantly supply water to all irrigation systems in the Transcaucasus; the area of irrigated land there will be greatly expanded.

	Grekov went on to say: According to Stalin's suggestion, the Fifth Five-Year Plan also stipulates large-scale drainage work. Extremely extensive drainage work is underway in the Polesie region of Ukraine and Belarus. Extensive irrigation projects will also be completed in the Barabinsk Lowland between the Ob and Irtysh rivers. Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and the Karelo-Finnish Republics are reclaiming marshland.

	Grekov emphasized that the above measures are being carried out in conjunction with other large-scale works to transform nature, especially afforestation work on the grasslands. The Soviet Union has already made great progress in afforestation. In the past three and a half years, the Soviet Union has afforested 2.6 million hectares. According to the Fifth Five-Year Plan, collective farms and state farms will afforest at least 2.5 million hectares and build 30,000 to 35,000 ponds and reservoirs.

	Grekov concluded by saying: Under the time-tested leadership of their beloved Party, the great Lenin and Stalin’s Party, the Soviet people will accomplish the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan regarding the transformation of nature. This is an important prerequisite for creating abundant agricultural products in the Soviet Union.

### 在久经考验的列宁斯大林党领导之下  斯大林改造自然计划顺利进行中

    在久经考验的列宁斯大林党领导之下
    斯大林改造自然计划顺利进行中
   【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科消息：真理报六日发表了格雷波夫教授题为“斯大林改造自然的计划在进行中”的文章。作者指出：苏联人民在伏尔加河、顿河、第聂伯河和阿姆河畔正在建筑的庞大的水电站，即斯大林共产主义建设工程，使苏维埃农业比以前具有更辉煌的前途了。单用这些水电站的设备来灌溉和供水的干燥土地就将有二千八百多万公顷。
    改良土地的建设工程之所以具有宏大的规模，是党、政府和斯大林本人大力发展的直接结果。以上等设备供应苏维埃农业的社会主义工业的进步，以及集体农庄和国营农场的成就，已为第五个五年计划期间更广泛地改良土地奠定了基础。根据第五个五年计划，要在五年期间，将受灌溉的田地面积增加百分之三十到三十五，把排去积水的土地面积增加百分之四十到四十五。
    到一九五五年，列宁运河和齐姆良水库的设备将灌溉五十五万公顷的土地，并供给一百一十万公顷土地的用水。在古比雪夫水电站地区，将建筑广泛的灌溉系统。那里将建造约二千座水闸，以拦蓄春汛。一个容水一千五百多万公方的水库、若干抽水站和灌溉网，将用伏尔加河的水灌溉古比雪夫州的土地。
    在第五个五年计划期间，在土库曼大运河、斯大林格勒水电站、南乌克兰运河和北克里米亚运河的区域，将开始关于灌溉与供水系统的建筑工程。凡是可以利用的当地灌溉水源，都将首先使用。
    在中亚细亚和外高加索等重要植棉区灌溉系统的建筑工程已呈现特别庞大的规模。以斯大林命名的弗尔干纳大运河将扩展到灌溉弗尔干纳中游地区。除了基洛夫运河所灌溉的土地外，伟大卫国战争期间在西尔河畔建筑的法尔哈德水闸和水电站，将以自流渠灌溉弗尔干纳流域附近饥饿草原上四十多万公顷的土地。正在外高加索建筑的明基卡乌尔水库，将经常供水给外高加索一切灌溉系统；那里的灌溉土地的面积将要大量扩充。
    格雷波夫接着说：根据斯大林的建议，第五个五年计划还规定进行大规模排除积水的工作。极广泛的排水工作正在乌克兰和白俄罗斯的波列斯耶进行。在位于鄂毕河与额尔齐斯河之间的巴拉宾斯克低地，也将完成广泛的灌溉工程。拉脱维亚、立陶宛、爱沙尼亚和卡累利阿—芬兰各共和国则正在开垦沼地。
    格雷波夫强调指出：上述的措施是结合着改造自然的其他大规模的工作，特别是在草原上的造林工作进行的。苏联目前在造林方面，已经有很大的进展。在最近三年半内，苏联已造林二百六十万公顷。根据第五个五年计划，集体农庄和国营农场将至少造林二百五十万公顷，并建设三万到三万五千个池塘和蓄水池。
    格雷波夫最后说：苏联人民在他们所爱戴的党，伟大的列宁与斯大林党的久经考验的领导之下，将完成第五个五年计划关于改造自然的任务。这是在苏联创造丰富农产品的一个重要的先决条件。
