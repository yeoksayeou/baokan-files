Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 27th: The American aggressors are inhumanely using chemical weapons to injure prisoners of war on a large scale. This is a direct result of the illegal resolution on the Korean issue passed by the Seventh United Nations General Assembly under the manipulation of the United States.

Beginning in December of last year, encouraged by the illegal resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, the US side intensified its activities of forcibly detaining prisoners of war to use them as cannon fodder. However, this act of the US side, which violates the Geneva Convention, was resolutely resisted by the prisoners of war. In order to persecute the prisoners of war, the US side, in addition to continuing a series of bloody massacres, disregarded all human morality and violated all international conventions by using chemical weapons on a large scale against prisoners of war, starting in January of this year. According to the materials published by the US side itself, in less than three months, the US side used chemical weapons to attack prisoners of war eight times. On January 13, the US side surrounded the prisoners of war in the Geoji Island prisoner-of-war camp on three sides and sprayed them with chemical weapons. On February 7, the US side compressed the prisoners of war on Geoji Island who were singing into the barracks and then attacked them with chemical weapons. On February 9, the US side sprayed the prisoners of war who were singing on Geoji Island three more times with chemical weapons. But the prisoners of war still sang unyieldingly. The US side used grenades and weapons fire to drive the prisoners of war into the barracks, and then continued to use chemical weapons to carry out the massacre. On March 16, the US side used chemical weapons to attack more than 2,000 prisoners of war on Longcao Island. On March 19, the US side again used chemical weapons to attack 8,000 prisoners of war on Longcao Island. On March 23 and 24, the US side used chemical weapons to attack prisoners of war three times on Geoji Island and Beongam Island. These incidents show that the US side is using chemical weapons against prisoners of war more and more frequently and on an increasingly large scale.

The chemical weapons used by the US side to attack prisoners of war, in addition to tear gas, also include a so-called "irritant." The US side initially claimed that this so-called "irritant" was "non-toxic" and that no prisoners of war were injured. The US camp commander Cardwell shamelessly declared that this was America's "extremely humane means." However, American news agencies reported that prisoners of war were forced to prepare soapy water to wash off this "irritant" that had been sprayed on their bodies, indicating that the so-called "irritant" was very likely a blistering venom that adhered to the human body. The US side itself also admitted that on March 24, the US side used this "irritant" against the prisoners of war who were singing on Beongam Island, so the injured prisoners of war reached 80 percent, but the US side did not give them any treatment.

Observers here pointed out that the US side's large-scale use of chemical weapons against prisoners of war shows that after the US side was unable to force prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder through massacres and torture, it is implementing an extremely vicious and cruel policy. This policy is to ensure that prisoners of war who firmly demand repatriation, after being attacked by chemical weapons, either become disabled or die from serious injuries. The US side's purpose is obviously to ensure that even if these prisoners of war are repatriated in the future, they will already be people who have lost their ability to work, and therefore unable to live a peaceful working life. For those prisoners of war who die from serious injuries, the US side can also use the excuse of "death from illness" to shirk its responsibility. This heinous crime of the American aggressors completely exposes their "humanitarian" lies.

### 美国侵略者用化学武器进攻我被俘人员

    美国侵略者用化学武器进攻我被俘人员
    【新华社开城二十七日电】美国侵略者正在惨无人道地用化学武器大批伤害战俘。这是联合国第七届大会在美国操纵之下通过关于朝鲜问题的非法决议案的直接结果之一。
    从去年十二月开始，美方在联合国大会非法决议案鼓励之下，加紧了强迫扣留战俘充当炮灰的活动。但是美方这种违反日内瓦公约的暴行遭到了战俘们的坚决反抗。为了对战俘进行迫害，美方除了继续进行一连串的血腥屠杀而外，从今年一月份起，竟然蔑视一切人类道德，违反一切国际公约，对战俘大规模使用了化学武器。仅仅根据美方自己公布的材料，在不到三个月的时间内，美方就用化学武器对战俘实行了八次进攻。一月十三日，美方在巨济岛战俘营中将战俘三面包围，用化学武器向他们喷射。二月七日，美方将巨济岛上唱歌的战俘压缩在营房内，然后用化学武器施行攻击。二月九日，美方又三次用化学武器喷射巨济岛上唱歌的战俘。但是战俘仍然高歌不屈，美方就用手榴弹和武器火力把战俘驱入营房，然后继续用化学武器进行屠杀。三月十六日，美方在龙草岛用化学武器进攻两千多名战俘。三月十九日，美方又在龙草岛用化学武器进攻八千名战俘。三月二十三日、二十四日，美方在巨济岛、蜂岩岛三次用化学武器进攻战俘。这些事件显示，美方正在越来越频繁、越来越大规模地对战俘使用化学武器。
    美方进攻战俘所使用的化学武器，除了催泪性毒气而外，还有一种所谓“刺激物”。美方最初宣称这种所谓“刺激物”是“无毒”的，并且说没有战俘受伤。美方战俘营长官卡德维尔还无耻地宣称这是美国的“极为人道的手段”。但是美国通讯社报道说，战俘为了洗去这种被喷射到身上的“刺激物”，曾被迫准备了肥皂水，这说明所谓“刺激物”完全可能是黏附人体的糜烂性毒液。美方自己也承认，三月二十四日美方对蜂岩岛上唱歌的战俘使用这种“刺激物”，因此受伤的战俘达到百分之八十，而美方却不给他们以任何治疗。
    此间观察家指出，美方对战俘大规模使用化学武器，表明美方在用屠杀、酷刑都无法强迫战俘充当炮灰之后，正在实行极端恶毒残忍的政策。这个政策就是要使坚决要求遣返的战俘，在受到化学武器的攻击之后，不是成为残废，就是因受伤过重而死亡。美方的目的显然是要使这些战俘将来即使被遣返，也已经是丧失了劳动能力的人，因而无法再过和平劳动的生活。对于那些因受伤过重而死亡的战俘，美方也可以用“病死”的借口来推脱自己的责任。美国侵略者这种丧尽天良的罪恶行为，彻底揭穿了他们嘴里的“人道主义”鬼话。
