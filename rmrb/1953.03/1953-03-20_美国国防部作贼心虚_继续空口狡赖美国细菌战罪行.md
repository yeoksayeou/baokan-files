Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: The U.S. Department of Defense issued a communique on March 13th, once again making a futile attempt to deny the U.S. germ warfare crimes confessed by captured U.S. airmen.

The U.S. Department of Defense said in the communique that it was "appalled" by the screening of the film in Latin America and elsewhere, which showed the truth of U.S. germ warfare as confessed by U.S. air force prisoners of war. The communique also admitted that many U.S. prisoners of war had written to their parents, relatives, and friends, telling them the shocking facts about the U.S. conducting germ warfare in Korea. In the communique, the U.S. Department of Defense attempted to make the world and the American people believe that the confessions of the U.S. Air Force prisoners of war and the facts pointed out in the letters from U.S. prisoners of war's families were a kind of so-called "Communist propaganda." However, the U.S. Department of Defense, like the U.S. State Department or the U.S. Far East Command, could neither deny that these prisoners of war were U.S. military personnel, nor dare to deny any specific content in the confessions of these prisoners of war.

Sources here point out that the U.S. Department of Defense's communique proves that people all over the world, including the American people, have clearly seen the heinous crimes of the U.S. government in carrying out germ warfare from the confessions of the U.S. Air Force prisoners of war, and have aroused great indignation. The U.S. Department of Defense's guilt-ridden attempt to continue to falsely deny only exposes the criminal face of the U.S. government more thoroughly.

    美国国防部作贼心虚
    继续空口狡赖美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社十九日讯】美国国防部在三月十三日发表了一个公报，又一次徒然地企图抵赖被俘的美国空军人员所供认的美国进行细菌战的罪行。
    美国国防部在公报中说，它对于由美国空军战俘供认美国进行细菌战的实况摄成的电影在拉丁美洲和其他各地放映，感到“惊骇”。公报还承认，有许多美国战俘已经写信给他们的父母、亲戚和朋友，把美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的惊人事实告诉了他们。美国国防部在公报中企图要全世界和美国人民相信，美国空军战俘的供词和美国战俘家信中所指出的事实，都是一种所谓“共产党宣传”。可是，美国国防部也和美国国务院或是美国远东司令部一样，既无法否认这些战俘是美军人员，又不敢对这些战俘的供词中的任何一点具体内容作任何抵赖。
    此间人士指出：美国国防部的公报证明，全世界人民，包括美国人民在内，已经从美国空军战俘的供词中清楚地看到了美国政府进行细菌战的滔天罪行，并且引起了极大的愤慨。美国国防部作贼心虚地企图继续空口狡赖，只是使美国政府的犯罪面目暴露得更加彻底而已。
