Illegal Capitalists in Suzhou and Other Places Retaliate Against and Strike at Workers
Local People's Procuratorates, in Coordination with Relevant Agencies, Handled the Matter Seriously

Recently, in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, Wuhu City, Anhui Province, Jinan City, Shandong Province, and other places, it has been successively discovered that some illegal capitalists have been using various vicious means to retaliate against and strike at worker activists in the "Five-Anti" Movement, resulting in serious incidents of workers being forced to commit suicide. People's Procuratorates in Suzhou and other places have coordinated with relevant agencies to investigate and deal with several such illegal incidents.

Illegal capitalists in Suzhou and Wuhu often threaten workers with suspension of meals, suspension of wages, and suspension of business in an attempt to force workers to resign voluntarily; or they maliciously provoke solidarity among employees, frame and slander workers; or they find various excuses to forcibly dismiss workers. Under the pressure and framing of these illegal capitalists, some workers committed suicide and died due to lack of livelihood or due to insults. For example, Xu Maotai, the capitalist of Tianhe Restaurant in Suzhou City, consistently abused workers cruelly. After the "Five-Anti" Movement, he further made things difficult for employees and refused to provide food, causing worker Hu Guiji to hang himself after not eating for three days. Sun Tiean, the capitalist of Fuda Paint Shop, forcibly dismissed worker Li Boshang, forcing Li to commit suicide by taking poison. Lin Fusun, the capitalist of Central Pharmacy, resented apprentice Wang Xirong for reporting him during the "Five-Anti" Movement, so he falsely accused Wang of stealing and arranged for people to monitor him. Wang committed suicide by taking poison (but was fortunately rescued) because he was wronged. Xue Maohua, the capitalist of Zhangxing Building Materials Company, also refused to pay wages and forced Chen to return home on the pretext of business difficulties because apprentice Chen Genhu had reported him during the "Five-Anti" Movement. Chen committed suicide by jumping off a building after returning home and having no means of livelihood. Ding Qiliang, the capitalist of Yufengyong Weaving Factory, prevented worker Shi Yongnian from joining the trade union and falsely accused Shi of attempting to rape his sister, refused to give him work, and forced Shi to leave the factory. Shi eventually drowned himself in the river. Particularly serious was Shao Xiwan, the director of the Suzhou City Tofu Industry Guild, who openly beat worker representative Wang Luoxi at the labor-capital consultation meeting, disrupting the labor-capital consultation meeting, and said to other capitalists at the capitalist representative meeting: "If we beat a worker to death, we have the support of more than three hundred fellow businesses, what are we afraid of!" Chen Shoujin Machine Shop in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, used the excuse of poor business conditions to coerce worker Gao Bencuan to temporarily suspend work and return home for two months under the guise of so-called "consultation." Gao faced extreme difficulties in his life after returning home. After learning that the machine shops in Wuhu City had received strong support from the government, he returned to the shop to request resumption of work. However, Chen Shoujin believed that he had not been home for two full months and refused his request. Just as the two sides were arguing, Chen Shoujin's son-in-law, Bu Guochao (capitalist of Bu Kaisheng Machine Shop, a local petty tyrant and feudal gang leader), rushed over, cursed Gao Bencuan, and threatened to beat him. Since it was already late, Gao had no choice but to swallow his anger and asked to spread his bedding on the ground to sleep overnight. However, in order to force him to leave the store voluntarily, Bu Guochao rudely threw out his bedding and refused to let him stay overnight. Gao Bencuan, feeling insulted and having nowhere to stay, drowned himself in the river. Zhu Yunlai, the capitalist of Yunxingchang Car Shop in Jingchun Garden, Changjie District, attempted to bribe worker Hu Xincheng with money in order to make the worker resign voluntarily. After Hu sternly refused, Zhu held a grudge in his heart. One day, Hu took Zhu's four-year-old daughter to play because it was raining and he could not work. Zhu fabricated facts and falsely accused Hu of intending to rape his daughter, and incited and bought other workers to give false testimony, plotting to dismiss Hu Xincheng. Despite the dissuasion of cadres from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the labor department, Zhu not only did not repent but also said: "I am willing to undergo labor reform and will resolutely not let Hu Xincheng return to the store." Before the issue was resolved, Zhu used methods such as stopping wages, stopping meals, and not allowing him to enter the store to force Hu Xincheng to leave. Zhang Dehou, the capitalist of Fengyixing Musical Instrument Store on Huasheng Street, not only did not correct his mistakes and admit his guilt because worker Liu Xianmu and others had reported him during the "Five-Anti" Movement, but instead often satirized and insulted Liu Xianmu, retaliating against him, and said: "You targeted me in the 'Five-Anti' Movement, but I am still me." Liu Xianmu was a street self-defense guard and also served as a youth representative, and sometimes had to go out to attend meetings. Zhang Dehou often made things difficult for him on purpose. On one occasion, Zhang Dehou deliberately found fault and said that the erhu made by Liu Xianmu was not good and insisted that he take the erhu outside to sell it himself. Liu Xianmu, suffering from such grievances, was deeply mentally stimulated and committed suicide by drinking sulfuric acid the next day, but was fortunately rescued.

In Jinan City, more than 20 incidents of illegal capitalists persecuting workers with vicious means have been discovered successively. For example, Yan Taifeng, the manager of Taixing Printing Bureau, had beaten and scolded workers four times before and after the "Five-Anti" Movement, did not allow workers to register their household registrations, restricted workers from joining trade unions, and did not pay wages. As a result, four workers were forced to leave by him. He also often used the excuse of poor business to resist paying taxes, print fake trademarks, and fail to execute processing contracts. Liu Xingsheng, the manager of Daxing Paper Shop in District Three, cursed workers for "delaying production" when they went to the trade union to attend meetings, and beat workers for minor reasons such as returning late from outings. Zhang Shuming, the manager of Zhixin Weaving Factory in District Three, instigated others to steal the trade union fees kept by the trade union finance committee of the factory in an attempt to frame the finance committee member. He also often delayed wages. In order to seek a reasonable solution, the workers held a labor-capital consultation meeting, but after ten days, there were no results. Zhang Shuming instead beat the workers under the pretext. Afterwards, he fabricated facts and falsely accused the workers of privately setting up a court to try and beat him, and publicly insulted female workers on the workers' blackboard newspaper. He ate and drank extravagantly all day long, did not engage in production, and attempted to dismiss workers. Pang Zijiu, the capitalist of Fuxingheng Weaving Factory, also often delayed wages. Worker Zhang Shifu wanted to go home to visit relatives and repeatedly asked him to pay the owed wages, but to no avail. Pang Zijiu also often beat workers for no reason. Afterwards, he instead had his wife shout on the street: "The workers have beaten someone to death!" He also bought off street work cadres in an attempt to frame the workers.

The above-mentioned illegal incidents have been seriously dealt with after the People's Procuratorates in Suzhou and other places, in coordination with relevant agencies, conducted investigations. For example, under the personal leadership of the mayor of Suzhou City, the illegal capitalists Lin Fusun, Sun Tiean, Xu Maotai, Xue Maohua, and employees Feng Ahou and Chen Huafa, who helped the capitalists strike at and frame workers, have been arrested and brought to justice. After carefully investigating and studying the case of Bu Guochao and Chen Shoujin forcing worker Gao Bencuan to death, the Wuhu City People's Procuratorate also coordinated with relevant departments to convene a mass meeting of more than 1,200 people, including worker representatives, business representatives, and street representatives, and publicly filed a public prosecution. Finally, the Municipal People's Court announced that Bu Guochao was sentenced to 12 years in prison and Chen Shoujin was sentenced to 3 years in prison with a 3-year reprieve. After the meeting, the Municipal People's Procuratorate closely cooperated with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to organize private industrialists and businessmen in various industries to discuss the case with the workers. The Jinan City People's Procuratorate also filed a public prosecution against illegal capitalists such as Yan Taifeng in the city, and the Municipal People's Court immediately arrested them and brought them to justice, and held a mass meeting to deal with them seriously.

The correct handling of these cases not only effectively cracked down on the reactionary arrogance of illegal capitalists, but also reversed the behavior of some capitalists who abused workers, and labor-capital relations have therefore become normal. For example, before Bu Guochao and others, who forced worker Gao Bencuan to death, were arrested and brought to justice in Wuhu City, there were many labor-capital disputes in factories and shops in the city involving suspension of meals, suspension of wages, deduction of wages, and abuse and dismissal of workers, sometimes as many as thirty cases a day. For example, in July 1952, the capitalist Qian Zhenhua attempted to dismiss workers and not only illegally suspended work and wages, but also said very arrogantly: "I am not afraid even if you make a fuss at the Federation of Trade Unions." Capitalist Ang Chaohai snatched and smashed a worker's bowl while eating, preventing the worker from eating. However, since the Gao Bencuan case was handled, the attitude of the capitalists has changed, and there are far fewer labor-capital disputes. The correct handling of these cases has also raised the consciousness of the working class and encouraged the workers' confidence in struggle. For example, worker Xu Hanwen said: "In the past, let alone one of us workers dying, even if a hundred died, no one would ask. Today, we can be guaranteed." Some workers said: "Today, with the Party and the government backing us, we have the confidence to fight illegal capitalists to the end."

    苏州等地不法资本家报复打击工人
    当地人民检察署配合有关机关作了严肃处理
    江苏省苏州市、安徽省芜湖市和山东省济南市等地，近来陆续发现部分不法资本家利用各种恶毒手段报复打击“五反”运动中的工人积极分子，因而发生了逼致工人自杀的严重事件。苏州等地的人民检察署已配合有关机关检查处理了若干起这样的违法事件。
    苏州市和芜湖市不法资本家经常以停伙、停薪、停业来威胁工人，企图迫使工人自动离职；或者更恶意地挑拨职工团结，诬蔑陷害工人；或者找寻各种借口，强迫解雇工人。在不法资本家的这种逼迫和陷害之下，有的工人因生活无着或因受了侮辱而自杀身死。如苏州市添和菜馆资方许茂泰一贯残暴地虐待工人，“五反”运动后更多方刁难职工，不给饭吃，致使工人胡桂吉因三天没有吃饭而上吊自杀。福大颜料店资方孙铁安强迫解雇工人李伯商，逼使李服毒自杀。中央药房资方林符孙，怀恨学徒王锡荣在“五反”运动中检举他，便诬蔑王有偷窃行为，并布置人监视他，王因受冤而服毒自杀（幸被救活）。张兴建筑材料公司资方薛懋华，也因学徒陈根虎在“五反”运动中检举过他，便不发给工资，并借口营业困难，强迫陈回家。陈回家后生活无着，跳楼自杀。裕丰永纬绒厂资方丁启良阻止工人史永年参加工会，并诬告史企图强奸其妹，不给工作，强迫史离开工厂，史最后投河身死。特别严重的是苏州市豆腐业同业公会主任邵锡万，在劳资协商会议上公开殴打工人代表王罗喜，破坏劳资协商会议，并在资方代表会上对其他资本家说：“打死工人有我们三百多家同行支持，怕什么！”安徽省芜湖市陈守金机坊，以营业情况不佳为借口，威逼工人高本泉在所谓“协商”的名义下暂时歇工回家两月。高回家后生活极端困难，知道芜湖市机坊得到了政府的大力扶助后，便回店要求复工。但陈守金认为他回家未满两月，拒绝了他的要求。正当双方争执时，陈守金的女婿卜国朝（卜开盛机房资方，当地小恶霸，封建把头）赶了去，破口大骂高本泉，并要打他。当时因天色已晚，高只好忍气吞声，要求将自己的被褥铺在地下暂睡一夜。但卜国朝为了逼迫他自动离店，蛮横地将他的被褥抛了出去，不准他留宿一夜。高本泉受了这样的侮辱，而又无处安身，便投河而死。长街区景春花园云兴昌车行资方朱云来，为了使工人自动离职，企图用金钱收买工人胡心成，被胡严词拒绝后，朱即怀恨在心。有一天胡因天雨不能做工，带着朱的四岁女孩子要去玩耍。朱便捏造事实，诬告胡意图奸污其女，并挑拨和收买其他工人作假证人，阴谋解雇胡心成，虽经市总工会、劳动部门的干部劝阻，朱不但不悔改，还说：“愿受劳动改造，坚决不让胡心成回店。”问题尚未处理，朱即以停薪、停伙、不让进店等办法逼走胡心成。华盛街凤仪兴乐器店资方张德厚，因工人刘显木等在“五反”运动时检举过他，不但不痛改前非，低头认错，却因此经常对刘显木讽刺辱骂，打击报复，并说：“你在‘五反’中搞我，现在我还是我。”刘显木是街道自卫警，又兼青年代表，有时须出外开会，张德厚便经常借故刁难。有一次张德厚竟无故找岔子，说刘显木做的胡琴不好，硬要他自己把胡琴拿到外面去卖完。刘显木因经常受这种委屈，精神上受刺激很深，便在次日服硫酸水自杀，幸获急救未死。
    济南市不法资本家以恶毒手段迫害工人的事件，已先后被发现二十多起。如泰兴印刷局经理阎泰丰，在“五反”运动前后曾打骂工人四次，不让工人报户口，限制工人参加工会，不发工资。结果有四个工人被他逼走。他还经常借口营业不佳，抗缴税款，印制假商标，不执行加工合同。三区大兴纸行经理刘星生，以工人到工会开会“耽误生产”为名，破口大骂工人，并借工人外出晚归的细故殴打工人。三区志新织布厂经理张淑明，指使别人偷窃该厂工会财务委员保管的工会费，企图陷害这个财务委员。他还经常拖欠工资，工人为求合理解决，曾召开劳资协商会议，但费时十天，毫无结果，张淑明反而借故殴打工人。事后他又捏造事实，诬告工人私设法庭审讯和殴打他，并在工人黑板报上公开侮辱女工。他终日大吃大喝，不事生产，企图解雇工人。复兴恒织布厂资方庞子久也经常拖欠工资，工人张世复想回家探亲，一再请他支付欠资，都没有得到结果。庞子久有时还经常借故殴打工人。事后他反而让其妻到街上大喊：“工人打死人啦！”他还收买街道工作干部，企图陷害工人。
    上述这些违法事件，经苏州等地人民检察署配合有关机关进行检察后，均已作了严肃处理。如苏州市在该市市长亲自领导下，已将不法资本家林符孙、孙铁安、许茂泰、薛懋华及帮助资方打击陷害工人的职工冯阿厚、陈华发等人逮捕法办。芜湖市人民检察署认真调查研究了卜国朝、陈守金逼死工人高本泉案后，也已配合有关部门召开了工人代表、工商界代表、街道代表共一千二百余人的群众大会，当众提起公诉。最后由市人民法院宣布，判处卜国朝徒刑十二年，陈守金徒刑三年，缓刑三年。会后市人民检察署又与市总工会、工商业联合会密切配合，组织各行业的私营工商业者与工人们讨论过这一案件。济南市人民检察署也对该市不法资本家阎泰丰等提起公诉，该市人民法院即予逮捕法办，并召开群众大会严肃地作了处理。
    通过这些案件的正确处理，不仅有效地打击了不法资本家的反动气焰，同时也扭转了某些资本家虐待工人的行为，劳资关系因此正常起来。例如芜湖市在未将逼死工人高本泉的卜国朝等逮捕法办前，该市工厂商店中停伙、停薪、扣发工资和虐待、解雇工人的劳资纠纷很多，有时一天多到三十余起。例如资方钱振华在一九五二年七月间企图解雇工人，不但非法地停工停薪，而且十分嚣张地说：“闹到总工会也不怕”。资方昂朝海，在吃饭时，夺下并摔碎了工人的饭碗，不让工人吃饭。但自高本泉案处理后，资方态度转变了，劳资纠纷也少多了。这些案件的正确处理，同时也提高了工人阶级的觉悟，鼓舞了工人的斗争信心。例如工人许汉文说：“过去我们工人不要说死了一个，就是死了一百个，都没有人问，今天可得到保障了。”有的工人说：“今天有党和政府给我们撑腰，我们有信心与不法资本家斗争到底。”
