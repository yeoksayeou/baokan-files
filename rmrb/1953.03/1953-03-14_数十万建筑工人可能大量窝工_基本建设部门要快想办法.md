    Hundreds of Thousands of Construction Workers May Face Massive Idleness
    Basic Construction Departments Must Quickly Find Solutions
    [This Newspaper's Report] As the construction season approaches, a significant portion of new construction tasks for this year were determined and issued too late. Design and other preparatory work cannot keep up with the progress of construction. A large number of cross-year projects have been halted due to changes in plans. There is a risk of serious idleness among hundreds of thousands of construction workers across the country.
    According to statistics from the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, the engineering companies directly under the ministry currently employ 240,000 fixed workers, with approximately 450,000 to 500,000 regularly reporting contract workers and temporary workers. Comparing this with the number of workers required for projects that can start on schedule, 150,000 to 200,000 workers may face idleness. The idleness period may be as short as two months or as long as three to four months. If 200,000 workers are idle for 100 days, with a daily wage of 15,000 yuan per person, the loss in wages alone will amount to 300 billion yuan. Due to idleness in the first half of the year, there may be a phenomenon of rushing and catching up with work in the second half, which increases the possibility of reducing project quality. At the same time, due to the slackness of engineering tasks in the first half of the year and the tightness in the second half, there will also be difficulties in labor and material supply in the second half. The situation in major administrative regions is similar. In East China, most projects will not be able to start until the third quarter due to insufficient design, and it is estimated that 26,000 people will be idle in the first quarter, 21,000 in the second quarter, and 73,000 workers will be lacking after large-scale construction begins in the third quarter. In North China, more than 19,000 people will be idle in the second half of March, and more than 26,000 people will be idle in the first half of April.
    The main reasons for the serious risk of idleness are that the basic construction plans of various departments were determined too late, and specific construction tasks were not issued early enough. Many departments were unable to determine the construction areas for this year until early February, let alone promptly provide necessary design information. Some construction units submitted information but then changed it midway, causing the design to be reworked and wasting design resources. As of now, the engineering tasks that the construction departments in various regions have received and can prepare for construction generally account for only about 10% of the planned engineering figures for this year.
    The second reason for the risk of idleness is the failure to advance the design year. The designs for important projects to be constructed this year should have been completed last year. However, because the necessary and reasonable systems related to basic construction are still difficult to fully establish, the phenomenon of design lagging behind construction has not changed, resulting in phenomena such as suspension of work awaiting drawings, suspension of work awaiting materials, and idleness. In addition, this year's reduction in cross-year projects has left construction engineering departments in various regions unprepared, resulting in much waste in design. In recent months, 30% of the workload of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering's Design Institute has been scrapped due to changes in the intentions of construction units, and construction has also been largely idle at the end of January.
    The third reason for the serious risk of idleness is that the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering and construction units in various regions had some blindness in fixing workers last winter, fixing too many workers and neglecting that the accumulation and development of strength should be gradual. In addition, some regions wanted to solve some labor employment problems by fixing workers, so the number of fixed workers exceeded actual needs, and the quality was also a problem.
    Fourth, the design and construction organizations of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering are newly established and lack the necessary foundation. Many necessary systems are not yet sound, and work has not yet been fully on track. The design and construction forces are unbalanced, and the various technical forces within the design and construction departments are also unbalanced. The leadership has not grasped the design and construction preparation work tightly, resulting in low work efficiency and difficulty in predicting and proactively controlling many problems. Although the Central South Construction Engineering Company has received a batch of design tasks, it cannot complete the design tasks in a timely manner due to the small foundation exploration force and the small number of design technicians.
    Fifth, the review procedures for engineering budgets and related urban planning are somewhat incompatible with the current specific situation, and the efficiency is slow, so that construction tasks cannot be issued in a timely manner, and design and construction preparations cannot be carried out in a timely manner.
    In order to avoid the risk of idleness, in addition to accelerating the review and approval of basic construction plans, various units should strive to submit this year's basic construction engineering tasks to the design and construction contracting units in the project location on time, and quickly collect the design materials required for various approved projects. Construction engineering departments should improve their design and construction preparation work, and effectively improve work efficiency, in order to strive for more and earlier commencement of work. In terms of the priority of projects, in addition to the fact that several major projects have been prepared and must be started early, for the time being, we can also adopt the method of easy first and then difficult, so as to start work as early as possible and as much as possible, and seize the use of some suitable standard designs. The work of fixing construction workers should be resolutely stopped at present. Party and government departments in various regions should, according to needs and specific conditions in various regions, properly and as much as possible mobilize and persuade contract workers and temporary workers who have not yet reported to postpone their reporting time, and should rationally and uniformly allocate and use construction workers according to the engineering conditions in various regions. The financial and urban construction departments in various regions can also establish a unified review and approval agency to simplify the review and approval procedures for project finance, urban planning, and land allocation. The difficulties of circulating funds for construction engineering departments should also be appropriately resolved.
    In order to avoid the risk of idleness, it is also necessary to solve some ideological problems. At present, it is true that the plans of many departments have not been approved by the central government, but this cannot be used to cover up the shortcomings in their own work. For example, the Northwest Education Bureau's plan, the central government has approved the construction of more than 30,000 square meters of projects, but they have not actively allocated the approved figures to their affiliated units, and cannot provide information. Construction engineering departments should be wary of the phenomenon of "sitting and waiting for idleness." At present, some construction engineering units are rightly wary of the risk of idleness, but they have not considered enough to solve the risk of idleness through subjective efforts, and they have not solved the many problems existing in design and construction. For example, when the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company started construction in March, the cross-year projects alone required about 50,000 tons of materials, but only 5,000 tons of materials were transported to the construction site, and no material supply plan has been formulated so far, and 80% of the material personnel have nothing to do.
    In order to prevent the large-scale idleness that may occur this year as soon as possible, especially in order to more effectively and properly ensure the smooth implementation of the national basic construction plan on schedule, we should truly advance the design year this year, and at least the design of some major projects should be carried out in advance.

### 数十万建筑工人可能大量窝工  基本建设部门要快想办法

    数十万建筑工人可能大量窝工
    基本建设部门要快想办法
    【本报讯】施工季节即将到来，但因今年大部分新的建筑任务确定与下达过迟，设计及其他准备工作赶不上施工的进度，跨年度工程大部因计划变动而停止修建，全国数十万建筑工人，已有发生严重的窝工现象的危险。
    根据中央建筑工程部统计，该部所属的工程公司现已固定工人二十四万人，将定期报到的预约工、临时工约四十五万人至五十万人，以此与可能按期开工的工程所需要的工人数字比较，即可能有十五万到二十万人要窝工。窝工时间少则两个月，多则三个月到四个月。以二十万工人窝工一百天，每天每人工资一万五千元计算，仅工资一项就将造成三千亿元的损失。由于上半年窝工，下半年就可能发生抢工赶工的现象，这就增大了降低工程质量的可能性。同时，由于工程任务上半年松下半年紧，下半年劳动力与材料供应也将发生困难。从各大行政区的情况来看，也是这样。华东区绝大部分工程因设计不及，要等到第三季度才能开工，估计第一季度要有二万六千人窝工，第二季度要有二万一千人窝工，第三季度大量开工后，又将缺少七万三千工人。华北区三月下半月将有一万九千余人窝工，四月上半月将有二万六千余人窝工。
    造成严重窝工危险的原因，主要是各部门基本建设计划确定过迟，具体建筑任务未能及早下达。不少部门直到二月初还不能定出本部门今年建筑的地区，更不能及时提出必要的设计资料；有的建筑单位虽然交出了资料，又中途变更，使设计返工，浪费设计力量。截至目前为止，各地施工部门已经接到的能够进行施工准备的工程任务，一般仅为今年预定承担工程数字的百分之十左右。
    造成窝工危险的第二个原因是未能将设计年度提前。今年施工的重要工程本应在去年将设计作好，但因有关基本建设的必要的合理制度尚难以完全确立，设计落后于施工的现象仍未改变，因而发生停工待图、停工待料、窝工等现象。加上今年削减了不少跨年度工程，各地建筑工程部门对此准备不足，在设计方面造成许多浪费。中央建筑工程部设计院最近几个月来有百分之三十的工作量因建设单位的意图改变而作废，施工方面也于一月底陷于大量窝工状态。
    造成严重窝工危险的第三个原因是中央建筑工程部及各地建筑单位在去年冬季固定工人时带有若干盲目性，过多地固定工人，忽略了力量的聚积和发展应该是有步骤的。加上某些地区想借固定工人解决一部分劳动就业问题，使固定工人的数目超过实际需要，质量也有问题。
    第四，中央建筑工程部门的设计、施工组织都是新建立的，缺乏必要基础，许多必要制度还不健全，工作还没有完全上轨道，设计与施工力量不平衡，设计与施工部门内部的各种技术力量也不平衡，领导上对设计及施工的准备工作抓得不紧，以致工作效率不高，许多问题难以预见和主动掌握。中南建筑工程公司虽然接到一批设计任务，但因地基勘察力量太小，设计技术员太少，也不能及时完成设计任务。
    第五，工程预算及有关城市规划的审核手续与目前具体状况有些不相适应，效率缓慢，使建筑任务不能及时下达，设计及施工准备也不能及时进行。
    为避免窝工危险，除应加速审核批准基本建设计划外，各单位应争取把本年基本建设工程任务按时提交给工程所在地的设计施工承包单位，并迅速搜集已获批准的各项工程所需的设计资料。建筑工程部门应改进自己的设计和施工准备工作，切实提高工作效率，以争取更多更早地开工。在工程先后的掌握上，除若干主要工程已有准备，必须提前开工外，暂时还可按先易后难的办法，做到尽可能早开工、多开工，并抓紧使用一部分合用的标准设计。固定建筑工人的工作，目前应坚决停止。各地党政部门应根据需要与各地具体情况，妥善地尽可能地动员说服尚未报到的预约工和临时工推迟报到时间，并应根据各地工程情况，合理地统一调配与使用建筑工人。各地财经、城市建设等有关部门并可建立统
    一的审核批准机构，简化工程财务与城市规划及地皮调拨等审核批准手续。建筑工程部门流动资金的困难也应适当予以解决。
    为避免窝工危险，还必须解决若干思想问题。目前，许多部门的计划未经中央批核虽是事实，但却不能以此来掩盖自己工作中的缺点。如西北教育局的计划，中央已批准兴建三万多平方公尺的工程，他们却没有积极地把批准的数字分配给所属单位，没法提供资料。建筑工程部门则应警惕“坐待窝工”的现象。目前，有某些建筑工程单位警惕了窝工危险是对的，但从主观努力来解决窝工危险还考虑得不够，对设计和施工上所存在的许多问题，也没有很好地解决。如山东省建筑工程公司三月份工程开工时，仅跨年度工程即需材料五万吨左右，但运到工地的材料只有五千吨，而且至今尚未订材料供应计划，百分之八十的材料人员无事可做。
    为了及早提防今年可能发生大量窝工，特别是为了更有效、更妥善地保证国家基本建设计划按期顺利实现，今年应切实做到提前设计年度，至少应将一些主要工程的设计提前进行。
