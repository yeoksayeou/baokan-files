    Welcoming Writers to Immerse Themselves in Construction Site Life
    Zhu Hong and Li Huiyun write: We welcome comrades from literary and artistic creation departments to come to basic construction sites to experience life and create.
    Large-scale basic construction has begun, but the number of literary and artistic works related to basic construction is very small. We believe that when basic construction has been elevated to the primary position in national construction, comrades in various literary and artistic creation departments should also consider facing basic construction and serving basic construction. We have two specific suggestions: First, the cultural and educational departments of various basic construction units should vigorously help workers to carry out their own creations, and collect, organize, and publish their excellent works. Second, we welcome comrades engaged in literary and artistic creation to go deep into basic construction sites to understand and familiarize themselves with these people who are building the motherland, and use various literary and artistic forms to reflect their patriotic ideological qualities and creative labor.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    欢迎作家深入工地体验生活
    朱洪、李惠云来信：我们欢迎文艺创作部门的同志们到基本建设工地来体验生活，进行创作。
    大规模的基本建设开始了，但是有关基本建设方面的文艺作品，却为数极少。我们认为，当基本建设已经提到国家建设首要地位的时候，各文艺创作部门的同志也应考虑到面向基本建设和为基本建设服务的问题。我们有两个具体意见：一、各基本建设单位文教部门，应大力帮助工人自己进行创作，并把他们的优秀作品集中起来，整理出版。二、欢迎文艺创作的同志深入到基本建设工地，了解和熟悉这些正在建设祖国的人们，用各种文艺形式来反映他们热爱祖国的思想品质和创造性的劳动。
