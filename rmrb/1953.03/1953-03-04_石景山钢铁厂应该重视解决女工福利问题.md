    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Should Emphasize Solving the Welfare Problems of Female Workers
    A letter from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Communications Group: Female workers in our factory urgently request solutions to the following problems:
    (1) Our factory does not have a nursery, which causes many difficulties for female workers with children. The health of some children has been seriously damaged because they are not cared for. For example, Zhao Zehua from the Accounting Section lets her child lie on the bed while she works, resulting in the child developing rickets and being unable to stand at two years old. Li Kaiqiong from the Cadre Section has a child at home who has no milk to drink, while her breasts are overflowing with milk in the office. The child, at two months old, is lighter than when she was born. Some female workers are severely affected at work because they have to take care of their children. For example, Yang Siduan from the spare-time school took two weeks of leave because her child's nanny returned home. Guo Naiying from the Accounting Section had to resign to take care of her child after the nanny left. She said sadly before leaving, "Women in New China should participate in work, but if the factory administration does not assist in solving the problem of raising children, what am I supposed to do?" Many female workers see children as a burden; unmarried women are unwilling to marry, pregnant women want abortions, and women with children want to give them away.
    (2) Female workers do not receive adequate care during pregnancy. Tu Yinghua, a female teacher at the spare-time school, had a miscarriage after traveling a long distance to teach every day while pregnant. Female workers doing heavy work do not get menstrual leave during their periods, which seriously affects their health. Guan Yuru, She Meiyi, and Ma Ruifang from the Repair Department have all developed menstrual disorders as a result.
    (3) There are too few female restrooms. The General Office, with over one hundred female workers, has only one female restroom, and it takes more than ten minutes to wait each time one needs to use it. The Iron Smelting Department's office simply has no female restroom. The factory has no female bathhouse or rest room. Female workers are covered in oil and dirt after working all day and have no choice but to remain dirty or spend money to bathe in town.
    There are nearly five hundred female workers in the factory, and these problems are what the female workers urgently need to resolve. However, the factory administration has consistently ignored them or said they would take care of them but then failed to do so.

### 石景山钢铁厂应该重视解决女工福利问题

专栏：读者来信摘要

    石景山钢铁厂应该重视解决女工福利问题
    石景山钢铁厂通讯组来信：我厂女工迫切要求解决下列问题：
    （一）我厂没有托儿所，有孩子的女职工困难很多。有些孩子因无人照顾健康已受严重损害。如会计科赵泽华工作时就让孩子躺在床上，结果孩子得了软骨病，两周岁还不会站立。干部科黎开琼的孩子在家里没奶吃，而她自己在办公室奶胀得直流，孩子长到两个月反比生下时轻了。有些女职工为要照顾孩子而严重影响工作。如业余学校杨思端的孩子的褓姆回家了，她就请了两个星期假。会计科郭乃英因褓姆走了，他为照顾小孩只得离职。她临走时伤心地说：“新中国的妇女应该参加工作，但工厂行政不协助解决抚育孩子问题，我又怎么办呢？”很多女职工把孩子看成负担，未婚的不愿结婚，有孕的想坠胎，有孩子的想把孩子送人。
    （二）女职工怀孕时得不到足够的照顾。业余学校女教员涂莹华怀孕后每天跑很远的路去教书，结果流产了。干重活的女职工来月经时没有例假，严重影响了健康。修理部关玉如、佘美仪、马瑞芳就因此而得月经病。
    （三）女厕所少。总办公厅一百多个女职工只有一个女厕所，每解一次手就得等十多分钟。炼铁部办公室干脆就没女厕所。厂里没有女工澡堂和休息室。女工们干了一天活，满身油泥，只好任它脏着或者上街化钱去洗澡。
    全厂女职工快五百人了，这些问题都是女职工们迫切要求解决的。但工厂的行政始终对此看了不管或说了不办。
