To the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions:

The Preparatory Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, representing over one million workers in the province, expresses our deepest sorrow upon hearing the news of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world and the most beloved friend and teacher of the Chinese people. The death of Comrade Stalin is a grave loss for the working people of the world! We, the million-plus workers, are determined to transform our grief into strength, and forever follow the teachings of the great leader and teacher Comrade Stalin. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, we will resolutely unite more closely with the Soviet people and strive to defend the security of our motherland and world peace!
