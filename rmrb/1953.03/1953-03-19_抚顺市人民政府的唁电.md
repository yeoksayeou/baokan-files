Fushun Municipal People's Government's Condolence Message to the Presidium of the Czechoslovak Republic:

We are deeply saddened to learn of the unfortunate passing of the great leader of the Czechoslovak Republic and close friend of the Chinese people, President Klement Gottwald. With utmost grief, we extend our deepest condolences to you. President Gottwald's glorious life was entirely dedicated to the liberation of the working class and the great cause of world peace and democracy. His death is not only a significant loss for the people of Czechoslovakia but also a significant loss for the world peace and democratic movement. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, we are determined to further strengthen the close unity between the people of China and Czechoslovakia, unite with the people of the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people of the world, heighten our vigilance, and fight to the end for our common cause, together with all the people of the country.

		The People's Government of Fushun City, China
