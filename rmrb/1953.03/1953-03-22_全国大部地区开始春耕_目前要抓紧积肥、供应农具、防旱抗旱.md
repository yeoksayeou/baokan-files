    [This newspaper dispatch] Spring production activities have begun across the country, with spring plowing underway in most areas. Party and government leading organs at all levels are leading the broad masses of farmers in launching the 1953 patriotic production increase campaign. From the Jiangnan region to the Yellow River basin, spring plowing has begun; in the southern part of the Northeast region and northern Shaanxi and other places, spring wheat sowing is underway; in areas where winter wheat is planted, field management of wheat is being intensified.
    Since last winter, agricultural production leading organs at all levels have made a series of preparations for the 1953 patriotic production increase campaign. Most areas have convened labor model conferences or representative conferences at the provincial and county levels to carry out education on patriotic production increase and organization, and to summarize, exchange, and promote high-yield experiences for various crops; the Northeast and Southwest regions and some other provinces and regions have also initially formulated technical guidance programs for local major crops. In order to implement technical guidance, the Northeast region had established 456 technical guidance stations by February, and other regions are also successively establishing technical guidance organizations. In terms of training cadres and farmers, Songjiang Province has trained 200,000 farmer backbone elements, and Jilin Province has trained 125,000 farmer backbone elements and more than 60,000 propagandists. Rehe Province will also train 600,000 farmer activists before spring plowing. The entire Northeast region has trained about 4,000 full-time cadres for technical guidance stations. Hebei and Shaanxi provinces have both carried out mass technical instruction work. According to incomplete statistics, more than 4.3 million people have been instructed. Shanxi Province has centrally trained more than 1,500 technical cadres at the provincial and special district levels and launched a "Technical Instruction Month." In addition to having trained more than 600 cadres, Zhejiang Province is also preparing to carry out mass training after March. These measures will play a significant role in promoting the development of the patriotic production increase campaign.
    Winter production work and spring plowing preparations in rural areas have also achieved certain results. In many provinces and regions in the South, winter water conservancy construction and winter rice borer control work have formed mass movements. As of the end of 1952, according to incomplete statistics from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces alone, the area of rice root removal had exceeded 30 million mu. Some areas in the Northeast, North China, and other regions have launched mass fertilizer accumulation campaigns. In Rehe Province, the area of cultivated land using base fertilizer this year can be expanded to about 50 percent of the total cultivated land. By late February, the northern part of the Northeast region had sent out 20 to 30 percent of the accumulated soil fertilizer, and the southern part had sent out 50 percent. The work of mass formulation of production increase plans has begun in the Northeast, North China, East China, and Northwest regions. Many advanced mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives have combined the excavation of production potential and the promotion of advanced experience when formulating plans, which has promoted the local patriotic production increase campaign.
    Up to now, the North China Administrative Committee, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the provinces of Suiyuan, Shandong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Heilongjiang have all issued instructions on spring production work. The Central-South and Southwest regions have issued instructions on launching the 1953 patriotic production increase campaign. The Central-South region and Henan and Sichuan provinces have also announced policies for developing agricultural production after the land reform. In order to strengthen the specific leadership of spring plowing work and effectively overcome formalism and coercive commandism, all localities have begun to inspect the preparations for spring plowing. In late February, the Northeast region convened a symposium on preparing for spring plowing, and Vice Chairman Lin Feng instructed all localities to carefully check the situation of spring plowing preparations. After the meeting, provinces and counties have gone deep down to inspect and promote work. The North China region has formed inspection teams to go to various places for inspection. Hebei, Suiyuan, Fujian, Shandong, and other provinces have also sent out inspection organizations. Pan Zili, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, went deep into the rural areas of Xianyang County to understand the preparation work for spring plowing, and according to the difficulties still existing among local farmers in terms of livelihood, animal power, and agricultural tools, instructed local leading organs to lead production by starting from solving the difficulties of the masses.
    At present, according to preliminary inspections in various places, there are still some pressing problems that need to be solved in rural production. Winter production is the foundation of spring plowing, but the achievements of winter production work in various places are very uneven. In some areas of Zhejiang and Shandong provinces in the East China region, winter production has fallen into a state of laissez-faire, and the achievements of winter plowing are not as good as in 1951. In the Yikezhao League of Suiyuan Province, the autumn plowing area in 1952 was only half of that in 1951. From the perspective of fertilizer accumulation, the Northeast region has achieved better results, but there are still some areas that feel a shortage of manure. The imbalance among various regions in the North China region is very large. Lingchuan County in Shanxi Province has accumulated more than 80 dan of fertilizer per mu, while some villages in Xiangyuan County have only accumulated about 20 dan of fertilizer per mu, and even in most areas of Yanbei Special District, there are only seven or eight dan per mu. In terms of leadership in other regions, some have not even grasped the basic situation. There are still many problems in the preparation and supply of other means of production. For example, Songjiang Province distributed more than 3,200 units of various new agricultural tools to various counties last autumn, but more than half were still in backlog by mid-January. Many areas in Heilongjiang and Liaoxi have not yet formulated plans for promoting new-style agricultural tools and have not determined the targets for lending. The Northeast region once checked the seed preparation situation and found that if universal close planting is implemented, the seeds are still insufficient. In Liaocheng Special District of Shandong Province, only about 15 percent of the cotton seeds prepared have been distributed to the masses. The drought prevention and drought resistance movement in various places has not yet been universally launched. Many areas are still only stopping at general appeals and have not taken practical actions. They just shout "Insufficient rain and snow, we must prevent drought and resist drought," but they do not grasp the soil moisture situation, and they have not decided on measures to ensure timely sowing based on the soil moisture situation. Spring famine has already emerged in some areas, such as Sichuan, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and other provinces, where many farmers lack food rations, and other provinces also have some disaster areas. These areas need to further investigate the situation of farmers lacking livelihood and means of production and provide practical and timely assistance. In order to not violate the farming season and smoothly carry out the patriotic production increase campaign, it is necessary to further organize the masses of farmers and quickly solve the above problems.

### 全国大部地区开始春耕  目前要抓紧积肥、供应农具、防旱抗旱

    全国大部地区开始春耕
    目前要抓紧积肥、供应农具、防旱抗旱
    【本报讯】全国各地春季生产活动已经开始，大部地区开始春耕。各级党政领导机关正带领广大农民，开展一九五三年的爱国丰产运动。从江南到黄河流域，都已开始进行春耕；东北区南部和陕北等地春小麦播种工作正在进行；种植冬小麦的地区正在加紧进行小麦田间管理工作。
    去冬以来，各级农业生产领导机关已经为一九五三年的爱国丰产运动作了一系列的准备工作。大部地区都召开了省县各级的劳动模范会议或代表会议，进行爱国丰产和组织起来的教育，总结、交流和推广了各种作物的丰产经验；东北、西南两区和其他一些省区并初步制订了当地主要作物的栽培技术指导方案。为了贯彻技术指导，东北区至二月份已建立起四百五十六个技术指导站，其他地区也正在相继建立技术指导组织。在干部和农民的训练工作方面，松江省已训练了农民骨干分子二十万人，吉林省除训练农民骨干分子十二万五千人外，并训练了六万多宣传员。热河省也将在春耕前训练农民积极分子六十万人。东北全区已训练了技术指导站专职干部四千人左右。河北、陕西两省都已进行群众性的技术传授工作。据不完全统计，已传授了四百三十万人以上。山西省的省、专区两级集中训练了技术干部一千五百余人，开展了“技术传授月”。浙江省除已调训干部六百余人外，也准备在三月后进行群众性的训练。这些措施对于爱国丰产运动的开展，将发挥重大作用。
    农村中的冬季生产工作和春耕准备工作也有一定的成绩。南方很多省区，冬修水利和冬季治螟工作都形成了群众性的运动。截至一九五二年底止，仅据江苏、浙江、福建、安徽、湖南、广东、广西等省的不完全统计，掘稻根面积已经超过三千万亩。东北、华北等区的部分地区开展了群众性的积肥运动。热河省今年施用基肥的耕地面积，可扩大到总耕地的百分之五十左右。东北区北部至二月下旬已送出所积土粪的百分之二十至三十，南部已送出百分之五十。群众性的制订增产计划的工作，在东北、华北、华东、西北等区已经开始。不少先进的互助组和农业生产合作社，在制订计划时结合发掘生产潜在能力和推广先进经验，推动了当地的爱国丰产运动。
    到目前为止，华北行政委员会、内蒙古自治区及绥远、山东、福建、江苏、河南、陕西、宁夏、青海、黑龙江等省，都已发出了关于春季生产工作的指示。中南、西南两区发出了开展一九五三年爱国丰产运动的指示。中南区和河南、四川两省还宣布了土地改革结束后发展农业生产的政策。为了加强对春耕工作的具体领导，切实克服形式主义和强迫命令作风，各地已开始了对于准备春耕工作的检查。东北区二月下旬召开了准备春耕工作座谈会，林枫副主席指示各地认真检查准备春耕的情况。会后各省县已深入下去检查与推动工作。华北区已组成检查团分赴各地进行检查。河北、绥远、福建、山东等省，也都派出了检查组织。陕西省省委书记潘自力深入咸阳县农村了解了春耕准备工作，并根据当地农民在生活上、畜力与农具上还存在困难的情况，指示当地领导机关，应从解决群众困难问题入手来领导生产。
    现在，根据各地初步检查，农村生产中还存在着一些迫切需要解决的问题。冬季生产是春耕的基础，但各地冬季生产工作的成绩是很不平衡的。华东区浙江、山东两省有些地区冬季生产陷于自流状态，冬耕成绩还不如一九五一年，绥远省伊克昭盟一九五二年的秋翻地也只及一九五一年的一半。从积肥方面来看，东北区成绩较好，但也还有部分地区感到粪肥不足。华北区各地区间不平衡的情况很大，山西省陵川县每亩积肥已八十余担，而襄垣县有些村每亩仅积肥二十担左右，雁北专区甚至大部地区每亩只有七八担。其他地区的领导上，有的连基本情况也还没有掌握到。在其他生产资料的准备与供应方面，存在问题也还不少。如松江省去年秋季发到各县各种新农具三千二百多台，到一月中还积压一半以上。黑龙江、辽西不少地区还没有制订新式农具推广计划，没有确定贷放对象。东北区曾检查种籽准备情况，发现如果普遍实行密植，种籽还感不足。山东省聊城专区准备的棉种，发到群众手中的不过百分之十五左右。各地的防旱抗旱运动也还没有普遍展开，不少地区还只停止在一般化的号召上，没有切实行动起来，光喊“雨雪不足，要防旱抗旱”，但却不掌握墒情，没有根据墒情来决定保证及时播种的措施。有些地区春荒业已露头，如四川、陕西、山东、江苏等省，都有许多农民缺少口粮，其他各省也都有些灾区。这些地区，更需要深入检查农民缺乏生活和生产资料的情况，切实地及时地给以帮助。为了不违农时，顺利开展爱国丰产运动，必须进一步把农民群众组织起来，迅速解决以上各项问题。
