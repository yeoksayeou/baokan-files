How to Lead Township Cadres in Studying and Inspecting the Marriage Law
Tang Tie (compiled)

    Training cadres and getting their thinking straight is the key to the success or failure of the movement to implement the Marriage Law. In the key pilot work in Zhenfeng and Lanpu Townships in Minhou County, Fujian Province, some achievements have been made in resolving the ideological problems of township cadres, and some experience has also been gained.

        General Ideological Situation of Township Cadres
    For more than two years since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the vast majority of township cadres in Zhenfeng and Lanpu Townships have not received serious or systematic education. Although the main township cadres had heard several speeches on the Marriage Law at the enlarged cadre meetings of the district in the past, they were not specialized reports. Individual township cadres studied the Marriage Law at county representative meetings or training classes, but because what was said and learned in the past was not clear enough or comprehensive enough, not many ideological problems were solved. In addition, the township cadres themselves still have residual feudal ideas. Therefore, their erroneous views on the Marriage Law are still serious. Some believe that freedom of divorce means "divorcing at will"; some say that "Articles 27 and 26 and a half of the Marriage Law protect women"; others say: "The Marriage Law elevates women too high, and women will climb on top of men's heads!"

    According to the analysis of the materials from these two townships, the general process of township cadres' understanding of the Marriage Law roughly goes through three stages. At first, they only knew that there was a Marriage Law, but they didn't know what the content was; at that time, the Marriage Law was the Marriage Law, and the old habits were still the old habits. Later, new-style marriages appeared among the masses, and some young men and women acted in accordance with the Marriage Law and struggled against the feudal marriage system. Township cadres often disliked it, so they openly interfered with freedom of marriage by using "improper style," "incorrect thinking," or on the pretext of "poor mass reaction." Later, especially after the government handled several cases of cadres interfering in freedom of marriage in the second half of last year, township cadres took a passive and perfunctory attitude towards implementing the Marriage Law. They generally reflected: "The Marriage Law is really powerful, and if you don't handle it well, you'll go to jail!" Judging from the above ideological development, the main problem why township cadres have various erroneous understandings of the Marriage Law is that they do not understand the Marriage Law, and thus they have a fear of taking responsibility. Township cadres said: "It is difficult for an honest official to judge family affairs, and we don't understand the Marriage Law, so it is better to manage less or not at all!" But in fact, they are not ignoring it, because township cadres themselves have feudal ideas. They often do not manage what should be managed, and interfere randomly in what should not be managed. For example, in a township in the 14th district of Minhou, a young couple got married freely and asked the township cadres for support. The township cadres pretended to agree on the one hand, and arranged for the masses to oppose them on the other hand, saying, "We agree, but the masses oppose it, there is no way!" Forming a disguised interference in freedom of marriage.

    When the provincial work team went to the countryside this time, township cadres generally held a fearful of trouble, skeptical, wait-and-see, or passively resistant attitude, especially fearing to check the past implementation, and not actively reflecting the situation. Many township cadres talked about the distant but not the near, talked about others but not themselves, emphasized difficulties, and had no confidence.

    Study the Marriage Law and Draw a Clear Line Ideologically
    In light of the above situation, clarifying thinking, stabilizing emotions, and comprehensively explaining the basic spirit and policies of the Marriage Law is the primary step. The work team first convened an enlarged cadre meeting, adopting a mobilization report approach, from the shallow to the deep, from the distant to the near, combined with the specific situation of the local area, and explained the basic spirit of the Marriage Law, as well as the nature, principles, policies, and purpose of this movement. Through the comparison of the old and new marriage systems, the various erroneous understandings of the Marriage Law among cadres were analyzed and criticized, so that the cadres initially understood what the Marriage Law advocates and what it abolishes, vividly presenting the two sayings, two practices, and two results to the cadres, and helping the cadres distinguish between right and wrong and identify the advantages and disadvantages in their thinking.

    When organizing cadres to discuss this report, pay attention to helping cadres connect with reality and further draw a clear line between new and old thinking. This is an important educational work. According to the work experience of these two townships, township cadres, after listening to the report, still believed that the Marriage Law was "half good and half bad": the good thing was that marriage freedom did not cost money; the bad thing was that peasants were poor, had no time, and were not beautiful, and could not find a partner. Therefore, it is necessary to guide them to discuss and recognize that today's society is a new democratic society, and in the future, it will enter a socialist society, and labor is the most glorious; the conditions for finding a partner today are different from those in the old society; and today there are mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and cultural study classes, etc., and there are many opportunities for men and women to interact and contact, and it is entirely possible to find a partner in labor and study. On the contrary, in the old society, "men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving things," "arranged marriages," and "three kinds of gifts and six rites," many peasants were single for life because they could not afford the bride price. After solving the above problems, some people raised the problem of "more men than women," thinking that it was still difficult to find a partner. At this time, it is necessary to guide them to find the root cause: in the past, there was more drowning of baby girls due to the emphasis on boys over girls, plus widows were not allowed to remarry, people with the same surname were not allowed to marry, water and land were not allowed to intermarry, and the landlord class had polygamy. In the final analysis, it was the feudal marriage system that harmed people.

    After these problems were solved, some township cadres felt that it would be difficult to get men, women, old and young to support the Marriage Law. In this way, it is necessary to start a discussion from the feudal marriage system of "three obediences and four virtues" and the patriarchal ideas such as "father's authority" and "husband's authority" that dominated women, so that cadres can realize that the old marriage system was subordinate to the interests of the landlord class's feudal exploitation, and women were oppressed, and labor was greatly restricted. The Marriage Law advocates equality between men and women, family democracy and harmony, respect for mothers-in-law and love for daughters-in-law, and unity in production, which is subordinate to the interests of the working people in developing production. As long as it is implemented well, both men, women, old and young will support it. In the thinking of the cadres, the last problem is: many families today are old-fashioned families that were combined under the feudal marriage system, and beatings and quarrels are common, how should they be dealt with? Should they all be divorced? It must be definitely answered: no, it should not be done this way. Generally, for families that are not democratic or harmonious, they should be helped to improve the relationship between husband and wife and the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, so that they can establish a new family of democracy and harmony and unity in production. Only when the relationship between husband and wife is really bad and they can no longer live together, or when women are subjected to inhuman abuse, and the parties concerned request a divorce and the mediation is ineffective, is divorce allowed, and support must be given to the oppressed and abused women.

    How to Conduct Self-Examination
    After the above stage of study, township cadres have a relatively clear and comprehensive understanding of the Marriage Law, but the ideological concerns of fear of inspection have not been completely eliminated. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out in-depth mobilization according to the actual situation, explaining that this movement must adhere to the education policy, and explaining that the purpose of cadres' inspection is to further improve their understanding of the Marriage Law, distinguish between right and wrong, and improve their awareness. For general errors and shortcomings, responsibility will not be overly pursued, but it is required that in the future, they can correctly and regularly implement the Marriage Law in conjunction with the central work. And it is necessary to explain that the scope of inspection is limited to the four points stipulated in the "Supplementary Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Work of the Marriage Law Implementation Month," so as to relieve their ideological concerns.

    After the cadres' ideological preparation is mature, they can begin self-examination. In the inspection, they must first be inspired to boldly expose, and then conduct criticism and self-criticism in light of the spirit of the Marriage Law, and they can also be helped to analyze and improve, so that cadres can thoroughly solve the problem. Experience in Zhenfeng and other townships in Minhou County has proved that as long as the reasoning is clear and the inspection is carried out with leadership and in a step-by-step manner, cadres are willing to accept it and the inspection is relatively thorough. For example, the cadres of Zhenfeng Township examined their interference in the freedom of marriage of widows, detained a couple overnight, and sent them to the district for handling. After being criticized by the district, they still couldn't figure it out. Soon after, they interfered in the freedom of marriage of a young couple with the same surname (beyond five generations), held a mass meeting to struggle against them, and also expelled the woman from the Communist Youth League and dismissed her from her post as director of the Women's Representative Conference. After thoroughly criticizing their feudal ideas through this fact, they said: "This is all because feudal ideas are at play and they don't understand the Marriage Law. If we don't check, we won't know where we went wrong even if we break the law!"

    In the inspection, we must also pay attention to discovering good examples of township cadres in the past in the implementation of the Marriage Law and commend them in a timely manner to stimulate the enthusiasm of cadres. According to the inspection in Zhenfeng Township, there are three reasons why some cadres implement the Marriage Law well: First, the cadres themselves have suffered from the pain of the feudal marriage system and have a high level of awareness. Second, they have studied the Marriage Law in the county and district and have a relatively clear understanding of the spirit of the Marriage Law. Third, they can follow the mass line and patiently persuade and educate the masses. After good examples are checked out, in addition to commending them at the cadre meeting, they can also be discussed by the masses and rated as model cadres to set an example and enhance the confidence of cadres in their work.

    怎样领导乡干部进行婚姻法学习和检查
    汤铁整理
    训练干部，搞通他们的思想，是贯彻婚姻法运动成败的关键。福建省闽侯县枕峰、兰圃等乡重点试验工作中，对于解决乡干部思想问题方面做出了一些成绩，也获得了一些经验。
        一般乡干部的思想情况
    婚姻法颁布两年多来，枕峰、兰圃两乡的乡干部，绝大部分没有受过认真的、系统的教育。乡主要干部过去虽曾在区扩大干部会上听过几次关于婚姻法的讲话，但都不是专门报告。个别乡干部在县的代表会或训练班中学习过婚姻法，但因为过去讲的、学的都不够明确，不够全面，并没有解决多少思想问题。加上乡干部本身还有残余的封建思想，因此，他们对婚姻法的错误看法还是严重的。有的认为离婚自由就是“随便离婚”；有的说“婚姻法二十七条，二十六条半是保护妇女”；也有的说：“婚姻法把妇女提得太高，女人会爬到男人头上来！”
    据这两个乡的材料分析，一般干部对婚姻法的认识过程，大致有三个阶段。起初，只知道有婚姻法，不知道内容是什么；那时候婚姻法是婚姻法，老习惯还是老习惯。以后，群众中出现了新式婚姻，一些青年男女按照婚姻法办事，向封建婚姻制度作斗争时，乡干部往往看不惯，因此就以“作风不正派”、“思想不正确”或借口“群众反映不好”等，公开干涉婚姻自由。后来，特别是去年下半年政府处理了几件干部干涉婚姻自由的案件之后，乡干部对贯彻婚姻法就抱消极应付态度。他们普遍反映：“婚姻法真厉害，搞不好就要坐牢！”从上面思想发展情况看来，乡干部对婚姻法所以有各种错误认识，主要一个问题就是不懂得婚姻法，因此也就产生了怕负责任的情绪。乡干部说：“清官难断家务事，我们又不懂婚姻法，所以还是少管为妙，不管最好！”但事实上他们并不是不管，因为乡干部本身存在封建思想，他们常常是该管的不管，不该管的乱管。如闽侯十四区某乡有一对青年男女自由结婚，要求乡干部支持，乡干部一面假意表示赞同，一面布置群众反对，说是“我们同意，群众反对，没办法！”形成变相的干涉婚姻自由。
    这次省里的工作组下乡时，乡干部一般都抱着怕麻烦、怀疑观望或消极对抗态度，尤其怕检查过去执行情况，而不主动反映情况。很多乡干部谈远不谈近，谈别人不谈自己，强调困难，没有信心。
    学习婚姻法，划清思想界限
    根据上述情况，澄清思想、稳定情绪、全面地讲解婚姻法的基本精神和政策，是首要的步骤。工作组首先召开了扩大干部会，采取动员报告方式，由浅入深，从远到近，结合当地具体情况，把婚姻法的基本精神以及这次运动的性质、方针、政策和目的交代清楚。通过新旧婚姻制度的对比，针对干部中对婚姻法的各种错误认识加以分析批判，使干部初步了解婚姻法主张什么，废除什么，生动地把两种说法，两种做法，两种结果摆在干部面前，帮助干部在思想上分清是非，辨明利害。
    在组织干部讨论这个报告时，注意帮助干部联系实际，进一步划清新旧思想界限。这是一个重要的教育工作。根据这两个乡的工作经验，乡干部听过报告后，还认为婚姻法是“半好半不好”：好的是婚姻自由不要花钱；不好的是农民穷、没时间、不漂亮，找不到对象。因此，就要引导他们讨论，认识今天社会是新民主主义社会，将来还要进入社会主义社会，劳动是最光荣的；今天找对象的条件跟旧社会不同；而且今天有互助组、合作社、文化学习班等，男女交往接触的机会多，在劳动中、学习中找对象完全有可能。相反的，在旧社会里，“男女授受不亲”、“凭媒说合”、“三财六礼”，很多农民因为出不起彩礼，一辈子打单身。解决了上述问题以后，有的人就提出“男多女少”的问题，认为找对象还是困难，这时就要引导他们找根源：过去重男轻女溺婴多，加上寡妇不准改嫁，同姓不准结婚，水陆不准通婚，以及地主阶级一夫多妻，归根结底还是封建婚姻制度害了人。
    在这些问题解决后，有的乡干部又觉得婚姻法要使男女老少都拥护是很难做到的。这样就要从封建婚姻制度“三从四德”以及“父权”、“夫权”等宗法思想统治妇女这一方面展开讨论，使干部认识到旧婚姻制度是服从于地主阶级封建剥削利益的，妇女被压迫，劳动力受到了很大的束缚。而婚姻法主张男女平等，家庭民主和睦，尊婆爱媳，团结生产，是服从于劳动人民发展生产的利益的，只要贯彻得好，不管男女老少都是会拥护的。在干部思想中，最后还有一个问题是：现在很多家庭都是在封建婚姻制度下结合的旧式家庭，打骂吵架是常事，该怎么处理呢？是不是都要他们离婚呢？必须肯定答复：不，不应该这样做。一般不民主不和睦的家庭，应当帮助他们改善夫妻关系和婆媳关系，使他们建立民主和睦、团结生产的新家庭。只有夫妻关系实在恶劣，不能再共同生活下去，或者妇女受到非人的虐待，由当事人提出离婚要求，并经调解无效的才允许离婚，而且要给被压迫、被虐待的妇女撑腰。
    怎样进行自我检查
    经过上面一个阶段学习以后，乡干部对婚姻法是有了比较明确的全面的认识，但是怕检查的思想顾虑还没有完全消除，因此，应该根据实际情况深入地进行动员，说明这次运动必须坚持教育方针，说明干部进行检查的目的是在于进一步提高对婚姻法的认识，分清是非，提高觉悟，对一般的错误和缺点，不过分追究责任，而要求在今后能够结合中心工作，正确地、经常地贯彻婚姻法。而且要说明检查的范围只限于中共中央“关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示”中所规定的四点，解除他们的思想顾虑。
    在干部思想准备成熟之后，便可以开始自我检查。在检查中先要启发大家大胆暴露，然后对照婚姻法精神进行批评与自我批评，并可帮助分析提高，使干部能够透彻解决问题。闽侯县枕峰等乡经验证明：只要讲清道理，有领导、有步骤地进行检查，干部是乐于接受，并且检查得也比较深入彻底的。如枕峰乡干部检查自己干涉寡妇婚姻自由，把一对夫妻扣押一夜，还送到区上去处理，被区上批评之后还想不通，不久又干涉一对同姓（五代以外）青年男女的婚姻自由，开群众会斗争他俩，还开除了女方团籍，撤销她妇女代表会主任的职务，他们通过这事实深入地批判了自己的封建思想之后说：“这都是封建思想在作怪和不懂得婚姻法的缘故，要是不检查，犯了法自己还不知道错在哪里！”
    在检查中也必须注意发现乡干部过去在执行婚姻法方面好的事例，及时加以表扬，以启发干部的积极性。根据枕峰乡的检查，有些干部执行婚姻法好的原因有三个：一、干部自己身受封建婚姻制度的痛苦，觉悟较高。二、在县、区学习过婚姻法，对婚姻法的精神比较了解。三、能够走群众路线，耐心说服教育群众。在检查出好的例子后，除了在干部会上表扬之外，还可以通过群众讨论，评做模范干部，以树立榜样，提高干部的工作信心。
