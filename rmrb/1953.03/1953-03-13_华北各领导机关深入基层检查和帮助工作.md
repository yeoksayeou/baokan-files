Xinhua News Agency report:

Leading organs and people's organizations in the North China region, responding to Chairman Mao's call to go deep into the lower levels, inspect work, overcome bureaucracy, and closely connect with the masses, organized inspection groups and delegations in late February and early March to go to various provinces and cities to inspect and assist work at the grassroots level.

Since mid-January, leading organs and people's organizations in the North China region have successively launched democratic inspection work and the struggle against bureaucracy, inspected the bureaucratic work style of leading cadres and their detachment from the masses, studied and determined specific measures to transform leadership style and methods, and decided that this year, key responsible personnel from each unit will lead staff members in batches to go down to counties, factories, and villages to inspect and assist work at the grassroots level. The Trade Bureau and the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee have drawn nearly half of their staff members to form two inspection delegations, led by bureau directors, section chiefs, and other responsible cadres, to go to Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Tianjin, and other places on February 25th to inspect problems existing in the implementation of economic accounting systems in various cities and in spring plowing production. The Propaganda Department and the Organization Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also dispatched two inspection teams on March 2nd to Hebei and Shanxi, respectively, to inspect the actual effectiveness of the movement to implement the Marriage Law and rural party consolidation. People's organizations in the North China region have also organized inspection groups that are about to set off for work. In addition, the North China Bureau also plans to抽调transfer more than sixty capable cadres to form an inspection delegation to go to various places to inspect and lead the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.

The leading organs in the North China region attach great importance to this inspection work. Before the inspection delegations set off, many units conscientiously studied relevant policies and business-related issues. Each inspection delegation is led by responsible cadres. Before the inspection delegations from the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau and other units set off, Liu Lantao, Chairman of the North China Administrative Committee, gave clear instructions on the matters that should be paid attention to during the inspection work. He said: Regularly going deep into the lower levels, inspecting and assisting the work of lower-level organs, reducing the time spent working in the office, and resolutely overcoming bureaucracy are important leadership methods to ensure the correct implementation of policies. Only through well-organized inspections can we fully understand the work situation of each of our departments, expose bureaucrats, and eliminate them; and only then can we examine whether our work instructions are correct and ensure the implementation of resolutions. Liu Lantao said: The purpose of this inspection work is mainly to discover problems and help lower-level organs truly solve problems. Therefore, we must dare to boldly expose errors, dare to fight against bad people and bad deeds, and have the determination to overcome all difficulties and the spirit to uphold the truth to the end. In addition, we should also pay attention to discovering and praising those state personnel who are loyal to the revolution and serve the people wholeheartedly. Liu Lantao also gave detailed instructions on the methods of conducting inspection work. He said: Inspection work must be effective, go deep into key areas, be good at discovering and grasping important and critical issues, and then solve them conscientiously. He also pointed out that inspection teams should not only inspect the work below but also listen humbly and sincerely to the criticisms and opinions of lower levels on the leading organs, so as to improve leadership and improve work. After the inspection teams return, they must make systematic and analytical reports to the leaders, and the leaders of each unit must listen to the reports and solve the problems conscientiously, resolutely overcoming the phenomenon in the past where some leading organs only inspected but did not solve problems.

    华北各领导机关深入基层检查和帮助工作
   【新华社讯】华北区各领导机关和人民团体响应毛主席关于深入下层，检查工作，克服官僚主义，密切联系群众的号召，在二月下旬和三月初分别组织了检查组，检查团，分赴各省、市深入下层检查和帮助工作。
    一月中旬以来，华北区各领导机关、人民团体先后展开了民主检查工作和反对官僚主义的斗争，检查了领导干部的官僚主义作风和脱离群众的现象，研究并确定了转变领导作风、领导方法的具体措施，决定今年要有计划地由各单位主要负责人分批率领工作人员下县、下厂、下乡，深入基层检查和帮助工作。华北行政委员会贸易局和农林局已抽调约近全局半数的工作人员，组成两个检查团，由局长、处长等负责干部亲自率领，在二月二十五日分别到河北、山西、绥远、天津等地检查各城市实行经济核算制和春耕生产工作中存在的问题。中共中央华北局宣传部和组织部，也在三月二日派出两个检查小组，分别到河北、山西去检查贯彻婚姻法运动和农村整党的实际成效。华北区各人民团体也分别组织检查组即将出发工作。此外，华北局还计划抽调得力干部六十余人，组成检查团，分赴各地检查与领导反对官僚主义、反对强迫命令和反对违法乱纪斗争。
    华北区各领导机关对这次检查工作极为重视。检查团出发之前，不少单位认真学习了有关政策和业务方面的问题。各检查团都由负责干部亲自率领。农林局等单位检查团出发前，华北行政委员会主席刘澜涛就检查工作应注意的事项作了明确的指示。他说：经常地深入下层，检查和帮助下级机关的工作，减少在办公室工作的时间，坚决克服官僚主义，这是保证正确地执行政策的重要领导方法。只有组织良好的检查，才能洞悉我们每一部门的工作情况，使官僚主义者暴露原形，并加以清除；才能考察我们的工作指示是否正确，保证决议的贯彻执行。刘澜涛说：这次出去检查工作的目的，主要是发现问题和帮助下级机关真正解决问题，因此，要敢于大胆地揭发错误，敢于和坏人坏事作斗争，要有克服一切困难的决心和把真理坚持到底的精神。另外，也要注意发现和表扬那些对革命忠诚、全心全意为人民服务的国家工作人员。刘澜涛还详细地指示了进行检查工作的方法。他说：检查工作要得法，要深入重点地区，善于发现与抓住重要的关键性的问题，然后加以认真地解决。他并指出：检查组不光是检查下边的工作，而且要虚心、诚恳地听取下级对领导机关的批评和意见，这样才能改进领导，改进工作。检查组回来之后，一定要向领导人作系统的、有分析的汇报，各单位领导人要认真地听取报告和解决问题，坚决克服过去某些领导机关只检查，不解决问题的现象。
