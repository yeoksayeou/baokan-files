Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 17th. The Lhasa plains have thawed, and the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa are expanding this year's agricultural production based on last year's production.

    A large number of new-style walking plows, light carts, and various farm tools manufactured by the Iron and Wood Factory of a certain unit have been distributed to the soldiers participating in production, and large quantities of fertilizer have been continuously transported to the fields. The construction and renovation of old and new canals and dams on the Lhasa River are underway, and a new 7,000-meter-long canal that can irrigate 10,000 mu of land is also being accelerated. The vegetable seedlings of two or thirty kinds cultivated in the farm's hotbeds have begun to emerge. The winter wheat that was first tried has already grown.

    As early as before the spring plowing, various new-style agricultural tools and a large number of crop and vegetable seeds were transported to Lhasa from all over the country. Among them are new-style walking plows, seeders, sprayers for eliminating pests and diseases; wheat seeds from North China, Northwest China, and Ukraine in the Soviet Union; as well as Qingpi radishes from Lanzhou, Hami melons, and watermelon seeds from Sichuan.

    The general policy of agricultural production for the troops of the Tibet Military Region this year is to increase the yield per unit area of ​​major crops and vegetables, and the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu will be increased by one to two times compared with last year. A certain unit plans to increase the yield of cabbage and radishes from 5,000 jin per mu last year to more than 10,000 jin per mu this year. In order to better complete the production tasks, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa convened a agricultural production technology research conference in early March. Many production models, soldiers with rich production experience, farm managers, and technicians exchanged the rich production experience they gained last year at the meeting; agricultural experts who entered Tibet also gave many special reports on agricultural production. This meeting made the soldiers more familiar with the characteristics of the plateau climate and soil, and increased their confidence in winning this year's agricultural harvest.

    人民解放军驻拉萨部队开始春季生产
      【新华社拉萨十七日电】拉萨平原已经解冻，人民解放军驻拉萨部队正在去年生产的基础上开始扩大今年的农业生产。
    某部铁木工厂赶制的大批新式步犁、轻便马车和各种农具已分发给参加生产的战士们，大量的肥料已陆续运到田地里。新旧水渠和拉萨河上水坝的修建和整修工程正在进行，一条可灌溉一万亩地、七千公尺长的新水渠，也在加紧修筑。农场温床培养的二、三十种菜苗已开始出土。第一次试种的冬小麦已经长成。
    早在春耕之前，各种新式农具和大批的作物蔬菜种籽，就从祖国各地运到拉萨。其中有新式步犁、条播器、消灭病虫的喷射器；有华北、西北、和来自苏联乌克兰的小麦种；还有兰州的青皮萝卜、哈密甜瓜和四川的西瓜种籽。
    今年西藏军区部队农业生产的总方针，是提高主要农作物和蔬菜的单位面积产量，每亩地的平均施肥量比去年增加一倍到两倍。某部今年计划将白菜和大萝卜的产量，从去年每亩五千斤提高到每亩一万斤以上。为了更好地完成生产任务，驻拉萨的人民解放军在三月初召开了农业生产技术研究会议。许多生产模范、富有生产经验的战士、农场场长和技术人员，都在会上交流了去年取得的丰富的生产经验；进藏的农业专家们也作了许多关于农业生产的专题报告。这次会议使战士们更熟悉了高原的气候和土壤的特点，为争取今年农产丰收的胜利增加了信心。
