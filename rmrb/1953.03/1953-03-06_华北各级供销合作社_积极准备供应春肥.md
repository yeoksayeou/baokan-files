    North China's Supply and Marketing Cooperatives at All Levels
    Actively Prepare to Supply Spring Fertilizer
    Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in North China are actively preparing for the supply of spring fertilizer. The planned supply this year will increase by 60 percent compared to last year. Some areas have already begun to transfer and supply. Hebei Province has the largest fertilizer sales volume; in January alone, it supplied farmers with more than 110 million jin of fertilizer. In order to reduce circulation links and lower fertilizer costs, the North China region has determined to use counties as the operating unit, set up fertilizer sales points in appropriate locations, and mobilize and organize the masses to collectively purchase fertilizer.

    华北各级供销合作社
    积极准备供应春肥
    华北各级供销合作社正积极准备春肥供应工作。今年计划供应量比去年增加百分之六十。有些地方已开始调运供应。河北省销肥量最大，仅一月份已供应给农民一亿一千多万斤肥料。为了减少流转环节降低肥料成本，华北区确定以县为经营单位，在适当地点设置销肥点，发动和组织群众集体购买肥料。（新华社）
