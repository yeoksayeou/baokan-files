    Jia Fugen and Jia Guixiang Persist in Struggle for Freedom of Marriage
    In Guangwu Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, there is a young couple. The man's name is Jia Fugen, and the woman's name is Jia Guixiang. They picked manure and played together since they were little; they worked together when they grew up, and thus developed a very solid and deep love. Both of them wanted to get married, but they encountered many obstacles.
    Jia Fugen's father had long arranged a fiancée for his son. Fugen didn't want to, but his father said, "I've herded sheep for half my life, and it wasn't easy to find you a wife. How can I just give her up?" Regardless of whether Fugen agreed or not, he married the fiancée in 1944. After the marriage, Jia Fugen and his wife didn't get along well. They often got angry and quarreled, both were in pain, and finally divorced in 1948 with the approval of the district. In 1947, Jia Guixiang was also forced into marriage with Jia Sanfu by cadres like Jin Shuangyou and her parents. She was also very unhappy after marriage and filed for divorce in 1951. She was a Communist Party member. As soon as she mentioned divorce, the village chief Jia Youze criticized her: "Communist Party members can take the lead in work, but can they also take the lead in divorce?" However, Jia Sanfu, a veteran, understood some principles and also felt that this kind of loveless union would only increase the suffering of both parties. Therefore, with both parties' consent, they finally divorced.
    After Jia Fugen and Jia Guixiang were liberated from feudal arranged marriages, both were very happy and thought they could marry freely. However, local cadres and Guixiang's parents interfered with their marriage unreasonably.
    Guixiang's father controlled Guixiang, not allowing her to go out, and threatened her, saying, "If you associate with Fugen again, I will break your leg." The local Party branch not only did not support Guixiang but also helped Guixiang's family restrict her freedom. When Guixiang went to the branch for meetings, the branch sent people to pick her up and drop her off, not allowing her any opportunity to meet with Fugen. Branch secretary Wang Longqun and civil affairs committee member Jia Gengze also frightened Guixiang, saying, "Jia Fugen is a spy. If you marry him, you will be expelled from the Party." Guo Qiugui, the section chief of the County Public Security Bureau who was working in Guangwu Village at the time, also said, "Jia Fugen will be sent to the Public Security Bureau in a few days. For the sake of your future, I will introduce you to Zhao Zhisheng, a trainee from the Public Security Bureau!"
    However, these obstacles did not shake Jia Fugen and Jia Guixiang's love and their determination to fight for freedom of marriage. Once, Jia Fugen secretly sent a letter to Jia Guixiang through a neighbor's child, agreeing to meet at night with a stone as a signal to discuss marriage matters. At night, Jia Fugen climbed onto the roof of Jia Guixiang's kiln and threw a stone into the courtyard. The village cadres who were talking in Guixiang's house at the time discovered it and, on the pretext that Fugen was throwing stones to commit violence, created public opinion in the village to attack Jia Fugen. They also reported this matter to Guo Yingshan, the secretary of the district office. Guo Yingshan blindly believed the village cadres' report without investigation.
    In October 1951, Guo Yingshan went to Guangwu Village to summarize the work of substitute cultivation. He used some trivial matters to ask Jia Fugen to confess his thoughts. Fugen said, "I have nothing to confess!" Guo Yingshan said, "You have political problems. I'm here to arrest you today!" Saying this, he ordered the militiamen to watch over Fugen. Fugen heard that he had political problems and was frightened, so he found an opportunity to escape. Guo Yingshan led seven militiamen to chase after him, from Guangwu Village all the way to Dongqingbei Village. The masses heard that they were catching a spy and watched at the entrance of the village. Jia Fugen ran for three villages in a row and had nowhere to hide. Finally, he was driven to a cliff more than ten feet high. Guo Yingshan ordered the militiamen to guard under the cliff, from ten o'clock in the morning to three o'clock in the afternoon. The militiamen did not go up the cliff, and Fugen did not come down. Coincidentally, Jia Guixiang was returning to Guangwu Village from her uncle's house in Dongtan Village and heard the villagers discussing this matter on the road. She was very surprised and rushed to the cliff to shout to Fugen, "Come down and talk about whatever it is!" Fugen said, "Go away! Every word you say will add to my guilt." Guixiang said, "Even if there is guilt, you have to come down and talk!" Fugen would not come down, so Guixiang climbed up the cliff. This attracted many more people. Some people scolded, "These two have ruined the village, and now they want to ruin it up here in broad daylight; they have not only ruined the Jia family's reputation, but also the reputation of Guangwu Village." Guixiang's parents also rushed over and scolded, "You two are really shameless, you have ruined the reputation of our ancestors." Fugen and Guixiang were very sad and cried, "We have been turned into spies because of marriage matters. How can we continue to live when things have reached this point!" Fugen told Guixiang, "Go back, don't let me implicate you!" Guixiang cried and said, "If we can't get married alive, we can die together!" Saying this, the two of them covered their eyes with a towel, held hands, and jumped off the cliff more than ten feet high. Fortunately, the cliff was not very steep, with some slopes. Jia Fugen and Jia Guixiang rolled down the slopes and were not killed. After being carried home, they both woke up after treatment. Jia Wangnian, a volunteer teacher in the village who had a good relationship with Jia Fugen, was also dismissed from his post by the village cadres for saving Fugen.
    After this incident, the cadres continued to obstruct and persecute them. Six or seven days later, as soon as Fugen's injury healed, Guo Qiugui, the section chief of the Public Security Bureau, convened a mass meeting of more than 300 people in the village, attempting to mobilize the masses to accuse Jia Fugen of his crimes. The masses knew that Jia Fugen was a good person, and no one spoke. Guo Qiugui had no choice but to ask Jia Guixiang's mother to offer her opinion. Guixiang's mother said, "Jia Fugen incited my daughter to divorce and wants to marry my daughter. He is simply outrageous. I ask Section Chief Guo to bring him to justice." Guo Qiugui ordered four militiamen to tie Jia Fugen up tightly and send him to the county. Jia Guixiang was also present at the time. Seeing this situation, she was both sad and angry. Regardless of everything, she rushed to Jia Fugen and said, "If you leave for ten years, I will wait for you for ten years. With the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will have the day we get married!" Jia Fugen was thus sent to the Public Security Bureau and detained.
    During Jia Fugen's detention, the above-mentioned cadres who interfered with freedom of marriage spent a lot of effort to find evidence of Jia Fugen's "spy" activities. However, after half a year, they found nothing, so they pieced together some materials, saying that once the village held a meeting to execute a traitor, Jia Fugen did not attend, opposing the government's execution of the traitor. They also said that in 1944, Jia Fugen led four other young farmers to actively struggle against the landlord and was called the Five Brothers by the masses, which was related to the "Ten Brothers" reactionary group of traitors in the village in the past. Based on these, they suggested that the county judicial section sentence Jia Fugen to three to five years in prison. Initially, the judicial section believed that there was no evidence of espionage and rejected the Public Security Bureau's request for retrial three times. Finally, in order to accommodate the difficulty of the Public Security Bureau in releasing Jia Fugen after detaining him for six months, the judicial section added the crime of "adultery" to Jia Fugen and sentenced him to ten months in prison.
    In the autumn of 1952, Jia Fugen was released back to the village. When he met Jia Guixiang, neither of them was discouraged. They decided to hide it from the district and village and go directly to the county civil affairs section to register their marriage. Finally, they got married freely.
    The matter of Jia Fugen and Jia Guixiang being obstructed and persecuted was not reflected by the masses in the village until the judicial reform was carried out last year. The county then conducted an investigation and found that it was a case of wrongful arrest and wrongful judgment that violated the Marriage Law and interfered with freedom of marriage. At that time, the county sent cadres to Guangwu Village to hold a mass meeting, publicly corrected the case, announced that the previous sentence of imprisonment against Jia Fugen was wrong, and apologized to the parties involved. The relevant cadres made self-criticisms at the meeting. After this was handled, Jia Guixiang criticized herself at the meeting for not jumping off the cliff in the past.
    After Fugen and Guixiang got married, they not only worked more actively in production but also responded to the government's call everywhere. When the patriotic health campaign started, Guixiang's family cleaned up before others even started. This year, when the village organized agricultural production cooperatives, Fugen and Guixiang were the first to sign up to participate. Whenever mass meetings were held, they mobilized others to go to the venue early. The couple is living with great enthusiasm. Many people admire this happy couple and say, "People are energetic and horses are strong. Fugen and Guixiang have freedom of marriage, and they are enthusiastic about everything they do. The people's government's implementation of freedom of marriage is good." Later, the district also publicized the examples of Jia Fugen and Jia Guixiang striving for freedom of marriage, living a happy life after marriage, actively producing, and responding to the government's call at the material exchange conference, so that many people realized the benefits of the Marriage Law.

    贾富根和贾贵香为婚姻自由而坚持斗争
    山西平顺县广武村有一对青年男女。男的叫贾富根，女的叫贾贵香。他俩从小就在一起拾粪、玩耍；长大后又一起劳动，因而产生了非常巩固和深厚的爱情，两人都愿意结婚。可是却遭到了重重阻难。
    贾富根的父亲早就给儿子订了媳妇，富根不愿意，他父亲说：“我放了半辈子羊，好容易给你说了个媳妇，那能白白地丢了。”便不管富根同意不同意，在一九四四年把媳妇娶过门来。结婚后，贾富根与媳妇很不对劲，两人时常生气、吵闹，都很痛苦，终于在一九四八年经区上批准离了婚。一九四七年贾贵香也在干部靳双有等和她父母的强迫包办下，和贾三福结了婚。婚后也非常痛苦，也在一九五一年提出离婚。她是个共产党员，一提离婚，村长贾有则就批评她：“共产党员工作可以带头，离婚还能带头吗？”但是贾三福是个复员军人懂得些道理，同时也感到这种没有感情的结合，只有给双方增加痛苦。因此在双方自愿下，最后也离了婚。
    贾富根和贾贵香从封建包办婚姻下解放出来后，两人都很高兴，以为可以自由结婚了。但是，当地干部和贵香的父母却对他两人的婚姻进行了各种无理的干涉。
    贵香的父亲对贵香实行管制，不让她出门，还威胁贵香说：“你再和富根来往，非打断你一条腿不行。”当地的党支部不但不支持贵香，反而帮助贵香家里限制她的自由。贵香到支部开会，支部都派人接送，不准她有机会和富根见面。支部书记王龙群和民事委员贾更则还吓唬贵香说：“贾富根是特务，你要和他结婚，非开除你党籍不可。”当时在广武村工作的县公安局股长郭秋贵也说：“不几天就要把贾富根送往公安局啦，为你的前途着想，我介绍你和公安局的练习生赵支生结婚吧！”
    但是这些阻难并未动摇贾富根和贾贵香的爱情和他们争取婚姻自由的决心。有一次，贾富根托邻家的小孩偷着给贾贵香捎去一封信，约定在晚上以投石为号，两人见面商量结婚的事。晚上，贾富根爬上贾贵香家的窑顶，往院内丢了一块石头，当时在贵香家谈话的村干部们发现了，便借口说富根投石行凶，在村中制造舆论，打击贾富根。还把这事反映到区公所秘书郭映山那里。郭映山未加调查，就盲目听信了村干部的反映。
    一九五一年十月，郭映山到广武村总结代耕工作，就借一些小事叫贾富根坦白思想，富根说：“我没啥坦白的！”郭映山说：“你有政治问题，今天就是来传你的！”说着就命令民兵把富根看管起来。富根听说自己有政治问题，心里害怕，便找个机会逃跑了。郭映山带领七个民兵随后追赶，从广武村一直追到东青北村。群众听说捉特务，都在村口看着，贾富根一连跑了三个村都没地方躲藏，最后被赶到一个十几丈高的山崖上。郭映山就叫民兵在崖下守着，从上午十点钟守到下午三点。民兵不上崖，富根不下崖。恰巧这时贾贵香从东弹村舅舅家回广武村，在路上听见老乡们议论这事，非常吃惊，急忙赶到崖下向富根喊：“有什么事下来说吧！”富根说：“你快走吧！你多说一句话，就多给我加一分罪。”贵香说：“就有罪也得下来说呀！”富根不下来，贵香便爬到了崖上。这一来，又招惹来很多人。有的人就骂：“这两人在村里败不下了，还要大白天到这上边败；不光败了贾家的兴，连广武村的兴也败了。”贵香的父母也赶来大骂：“你俩真不要脸，把祖上的兴都败透了。”富根和贵香非常伤心，哭着说：“因为婚姻事闹成个特务，事情到这样地步，怎能再活下去！”富根嘱咐贵香说：“你回去吧，不要为我连累了你！”贵香哭着说：“活着结不了婚，可以死在一处！”说着，两人用手巾把眼一蒙，手拉手地就从十几丈高的崖上跳了下去。幸亏这个山崖不太陡，有些斜坡，贾富根与贾贵香从斜坡上滚下来，没有摔死。抬回家后，经过救治都苏醒过来。村里的义务教员贾王年平素和贾富根的感情较好，因为救富根，也被村干部给撤了职。
    经过这事以后，干部对他俩还是继续进行阻难和迫害。隔了六七天，富根的伤刚好，公安局的股长郭秋贵便在村上召开了一个三百多人的群众大会，企图发动群众控诉贾富根的罪行。群众明知贾富根是个好人，谁也不讲话，郭秋贵没办法就叫贾贵香的母亲提意见。贵香的母亲说：“贾富根挑拨我闺女离婚，还想和我闺女结婚，简直不像个样子，要求郭股长给我法办他”。郭秋贵便命令四个民兵把贾富根紧紧地捆起来，要送到县上去。当时贾贵香也在场，看到这种情形，又是痛又是气，不顾一切地冲到贾富根面前说：“你走十年，我等你十年，有共产党和毛主席的领导，就有我们结婚的日子！”贾富根就这样被送到公安局扣押起来。
    在贾富根被扣押期间，上述干涉婚姻自由的干部费了很大心机来找寻贾富根的“特务”证据。但是费了半年时间，都一无所得，于是就强拉硬凑的编了一些材料，说有一次村里开会枪毙汉奸，贾富根没去开会，是反对政府枪毙汉奸。又说一九四四年贾富根领导其他四个青年农民向地主积极斗争，被群众称为五弟兄，是与过去该村汉奸组织的“十大弟兄”反动集团有关。就根据这些，建议县司法科判处贾富根三年到五年徒刑。起初，司法科认为无特务事实，曾三次驳回公安局重审。最后司法科为了照顾公安局已将贾富根扣押六个月无法释放的困难，就给贾富根加上“通奸”的罪名，判处十个月徒刑。
    一九五二年秋，贾富根被释放回村，见了贾贵香，两人都没有气馁。他们决定瞒过区、村，直接到县民政科进行结婚登记。最后终于自由结了婚。
    贾富根和贾贵香被阻难和迫害的事情，一直到去年进行司法改革时，经过村上群众反映，县上才作了调查，认为这是违反婚姻法、干涉婚姻自由的错捕错判案件。当时就由县派干部到广武村召开群众大会，公开纠正这一案件，宣布过去对贾富根所判的徒刑是错误的，并向当事人道歉。有关的干部，在会上作了检讨。这样处理后，贾贵香在会上检讨了自己过去不应该跳崖。
    富根和贵香结婚后，两人不光劳动生产更加积极，同时还处处响应政府的号召。爱国卫生运动开始，别人还没有动手，贵香家就打扫得干干净净了。今年村上组织农业生产合作社，富根与贵香首先报名参加，每逢召开群众性的会议，他俩就动员别人早早的去到会场。俩口子过得顶起劲。很多人都羡慕这对美满的夫妻说：“人过精神马过膘，富根和贵香婚姻自由啦，干啥也起劲，人民政府实行婚姻自由就是好。”以后，区上还把贾富根和贾贵香争取婚姻自由，婚后生活美满，生产积极，响应政府号召的事例，在物资交流大会上作了宣传，使很多人都认识到了婚姻法的好处。
