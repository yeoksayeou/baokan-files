Reader's Letters Summary

Thoroughly Eliminate Rice Borers That Harm Rice

Shu Zhihao writes: The "Three-Brood Borer" is very harmful to rice. Farmers in rice-growing areas, in order to strive for a good harvest, actively dug up rice roots in the winter under the call of the People's Government to eliminate rice borers, and achieved great results. However, some areas did not handle the dug-up rice roots properly. For example, many farmers in southern Jiangsu piled the dug-up rice roots on the edge of the fields instead of burning them. Currently, the vernal equinox has passed, and rice-growing areas across the country have begun or are beginning spring plowing. The borer eggs in the rice roots will hatch into insects and crawl out to harm the rice seedlings. Therefore, it is suggested that the People's Governments in rice-growing areas promptly educate and guide farmers to destroy the dug-up rice roots in order to thoroughly eliminate rice borers.

Weixian Tobacco and Hemp Company Continues to Make Mistakes; Manager Zhang Ziping Has Yet to Self-Criticize and Correct

Song Yan writes: The Weixian Branch of the China Tobacco and Hemp Company (formerly the Weifang Tobacco Company of the Local Products Company) reported to the former Central Ministry of Trade in the autumn of 1952 that the company had more than ten million catties of yellow tobacco in stock. The former Central Ministry of Trade then signed trade contracts with foreign countries based on this figure. Later, when the company was asked to deliver the tobacco, an inspection revealed that there were actually only two million catties. Therefore, the Shandong Provincial Local Products Company instructed the company's manager and relevant personnel to conduct self-criticism, but the company's manager Zhang Ziping expressed "dissatisfaction" upon receiving the instruction and has refused to conduct self-criticism to this day.

After the incident of falsely reporting the number of yellow tobacco occurred, the higher authorities instructed the company to thoroughly clean up the accumulated materials. Zhang Ziping also failed to implement this, procrastinating again and again, and is still unaware of the company's materials, resulting in more than ten thousand catties of yellow tobacco being moldy recently. It is suggested that the Shandong Provincial Local Products Company and the local Party organization urge the company to earnestly check and correct this chaotic phenomenon.

Inner Mongolia Company of China Coal Construction Company Should Not Continue to Allocate Rotten Timber into the Customs

Zhang Chaozhong writes: Just as the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government was inspecting the Northeast China Company of China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company for erroneously allocating rotten timber into the customs, the Inner Mongolia Company of China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company followed the old path of the Northeast China Company, transporting substandard rotten timber into the customs. Last December, the company successively sent ten and fourteen-meter-long larch logs from Boketu to Tianjin. According to the contract, they should be first, second, and third-grade materials, but they used fourth-grade or substandard materials to replace first-grade materials. These rotten long materials have lost the use value of long materials. They kept the original length to form a truck transport, wasting 20 million yuan in transportation costs alone. Recently, 98 trucks of larch logs were transported to Tianjin by the company. The actual first-grade materials only accounted for 45.8 percent of the quantity stipulated in the waybill; the actual substandard materials received were 396.66 percent of the original number; and the fourth-grade materials, which were not on the waybill at all, were found to be 180.88 cubic meters. These substandard rotten timbers cannot be processed after being transported and are still piled up on the cargo line.

When the Tianjin Company of China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company first discovered that the grade of the transported timber did not match, it reported it in writing to the North China Company of China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company on January 23; but this phenomenon was not stopped as a result, and substandard timber from the Inner Mongolia area continued to be transported into the customs one after another. Please ask the Supreme People's Procuratorate to quickly inspect and stop it.

Four Boxes of Steel Plates Forgotten

Hu Sennian writes: Next to the first road maintenance area of the Fengtai Central Signal Building Engineering Section, there are four large wooden boxes, two meters long, more than one meter wide, and half a meter thick, filled with six or seven-centimeter-thick steel plates for water towers. These four wooden boxes have been placed in this place since 1951. After long-term wind and rain, some of the steel plates have rusted. A long time ago, I wrote a letter about this situation to the "Railway Worker Newspaper" of the Tianjin Railway Administration, but these things are still "sleeping" there.

Factories and Mines Should Actively Guide Students to Conduct Internships

Letter from all graduate students of the Department of Chemical Engineering of Tianjin University: Sending engineering students to factories and mines for internships is an important method to combine theory with practice. However, at present, there is no unified internship system in factories and mines across the country, and the degree of importance attached to students' internships in factories and mines is also different, so the gains of students who intern in different factories and mines are also very different.

Some factories and mines are doing better: like the Dalian Chemical Plant, when students go to intern, they set up a special committee to be responsible for guidance, and they often organize special lectures and tutoring for interns to discuss in combination with the situation in the factory; they also make it clear to the interns what should be kept confidential. Students who intern at this factory feel that they have gained a lot.

However, some factories and mines do not provide guidance and assistance to students who intern with a positive attitude. In order to meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction, universities across the country are steadily carrying out teaching reforms; doing a good job in production learning is one of the important links. In the future, the number of students interning in factories and mines will increase greatly. It is recommended that the Central Ministry of Higher Education quickly study specific plans with various industrial departments to establish a sound internship system and strengthen the connection between factories and mines and schools.

Northeast Institute of Technology Should Not Arbitrarily Transfer Students to Participate in Administrative Work

Letter from Zhu Xuejuan and Zhang Yupu of Northeast Institute of Technology: Northeast Institute of Technology violates the policy and has transferred a large number of students to participate in school administrative work for years. According to incomplete statistics, 17 students were transferred in our hospital in 1951. Thirty-seven people were transferred in April 1952, and sixteen people were transferred in October of the same year. These students are all Party members, League members, student union cadres, or students with good academic performance in the first and second grades. Most of the work they do is general administrative work. Is the actual work situation really in need of these people? No. For example, the Academic Affairs Office uses two people to manage the materials, but in fact there are very few materials available and not many people borrow them, so one person is enough. For example, there are also two people doing the work of issuing letters of introduction and contacting visits and internships, and the result is very idle. Many transferred students have raised opinions on this. The leaders of our institute not only did not accept it, but thought that the students who raised the opinions had individualistic thoughts. In addition, the phenomenon of the school retaining graduates for administrative and political work is also serious. Zhang Shaoguang, a graduate of the coal mining group of the mining department, and Shu Dakuan, a graduate of the mechanical engineering department, both did Party and League work after staying at the school in 1951. There were more graduates who stayed at the school in 1952, and many of them also did political or administrative work. For example, Zhou Gang of the Metallurgical Department stayed at the school as deputy section chief of the student section, and Li Jiao stayed at the school as a secretary. Other departments have similar situations. This practice of Northeast Institute of Technology violating the unified distribution and specialized use of talents directly affects the country's plan to train technical talents. It is recommended that the Ministry of Personnel and the Ministry of Higher Education correct this phenomenon.

The Practice of Students Taking Turns on Guard Day and Night Is Wrong

Letter from Ge Ming of Suihua Middle School, Heilongjiang Province: Our Suihua Middle School in Heilongjiang Province has a situation where students take turns on guard day and night. Because our county's Public Security Bureau requires schools to have someone on guard; the school is limited by the establishment and cannot spare someone, so it can only let students take turns on guard. Now, more than 20 students are needed every night, each taking turns for two hours; during the day, the dormitory alone needs seven students, each taking turns for half a day. This will obviously affect students' learning and health. We have repeatedly reported this situation to the Provincial Department of Culture and Education, but the problem has not been resolved.

Fenyang County People's Government Should Not Frequently Suspend Students from Classes to Participate in Social Activities

Letter from Duan Jingxiu of Fenyang Middle School: The People's Government of Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, frequently suspends students from Fenyang Middle School and Fenyang Normal School from classes to participate in social activities, which affects the school's teaching work. For example, when the county held a People's Representative Conference of all circles, more than 2,000 students from Fenyang Middle School and Fenyang Normal School suspended classes for a day to welcome the people's representatives from rural areas. When the county held a public trial meeting, all the students from the two schools also suspended classes for a day to participate. In addition, there are many cases of suspending classes for half a day to a day for sending off and welcoming or listening to reports. In fact, many of these activities only require the school to send a small number of representatives to participate, without having to suspend classes for all students. It is hoped that the People's Government of Fenyang County will pay attention to correcting this phenomenon.

"Practical Dictionary of National Economy" Is a Book with Many Errors

Letter from Wang Yingming: The "Practical Dictionary of National Economy" (edited by Su Yuanlei), published by Shanghai Chunming Publishing House in January 1953, is a book with many errors. The preface of the book says that this dictionary, inspired by Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," "has undergone careful and prudent proofreading, adding new materials and revising many arguments...relatively comprehensive." In fact, the explanation of some important entries in the book completely violates Stalin's instructions. For example, the entry "Distribution of Means of Production under Socialism" believes that "planning is one of the basic economic laws of socialism," and mistakenly says that the law of value plays a role in socialist society in a "transformed" form. Many important items mentioned in Stalin's masterpiece, such as "the basic economic law of socialism" and "the basic economic law of modern capitalism," are not included in the dictionary. There are also many other serious errors in the book, such as saying in the entry "Commodity Production under the Socialist System" that in socialist society "the labor remuneration of each worker is not in kind, but in currency" (in fact, the labor remuneration of collective farm members is not like this); in the "Land Reform" entry, the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China" is mistaken for the "Draft Land Reform Law"; and there are also quite a lot of proofreading errors.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    彻底消灭危害水稻的螟虫
    舒志浩来信：“三化螟”对水稻危害很大。种植水稻地区的农民，为了争取丰收，去年冬天在人民政府的号召下，积极挖掘稻根，消灭螟虫，获得了很大的成绩。可是，有些地区在稻根挖出之后不好好处理，如苏南地区不少农民把挖出的稻根堆在田边，而没有把它烧掉。目前春分已过，全国各地的水稻地区已经或正在开展春耕。稻根中的螟卵将孵化成虫，爬出来为害稻子。因此，建议有水稻地区的人民政府及时教育与指导农民赶紧把挖出的稻根毁掉，以彻底消灭螟虫。
    潍县烟麻公司连续发生错误经理张子平至今未检讨改正
    宋岩来信：中国烟麻公司潍县分公司（即以前的土产公司潍坊烟草公司）于一九五二年秋曾报告前中央贸易部，说该公司存有黄烟一千余万斤。前中央贸易部即根据这一数字和国外签订了贸易合同。后来要该公司交烟时，一检查，实际上只有二百余万斤。因此，山东省土产公司即指示该公司经理及有关人员检讨，但该公司经理张子平接到指示后反而表示“不满意”，至今并拒不检讨。
    在发生这次虚报黄烟数字的事件后，上级曾指示该公司彻底清理积存物资。张子平也不执行，一拖再拖，至今对公司的物资仍然心中没数，以致最近又霉烂了十余万斤黄烟。建议山东省土产公司及当地党组织督促该公司切实检查纠正这种混乱现象。
    中国煤建公司内蒙区公司不该继续调拨腐朽木材进关
    张朝中来信：正当中央人民政府最高人民检察署在检查中国煤业建筑器材公司东北区公司错误地拨运腐朽木材进关的时候，中国煤业建筑器材公司内蒙区公司竟循着东北区公司的旧路，将不合等级标准的腐朽木材源源运进关来。去年十二月份该公司先后由博克图发往天津的十、十四公尺长黄花松原木，按合同应为一、二、三等材，但他们却以四等或等外材顶替一等材，这些腐朽了的长材，已经失掉了长材的使用价值；他们却保持原长搭成游车运输，仅运费就浪费二千万元。最近由该公司运到天津九十八车黄花松原木，实收一等材仅占运货联单规定数量的百分之四十五点八；实收等外材为原发数的百分之三百九十六点六六；而联单上根本没有的四等材，却检出了一百八十点八八立方公尺。这些不合等级标准的腐朽木材运来后无法处理，直到现在仍然堆存在货位线上。
    当中国煤业建筑器材公司天津市公司第一次发现运来的木材等级不符时，即于一月二十三日书面报告中国煤业建筑器材公司华北区公司；但这种现象并没有因此而制止，内蒙区不合等级标准的木材仍然接二连三地运进关来。请最高人民检察署迅速检查制止。
    四箱被人忘掉了的钢板
    胡森年来信：丰台中信号楼工务段第一养路工区旁边，放着四个二公尺长、一公尺多宽、半公尺多厚的大木箱子，里面满是六、七公糎厚的做水塔用的钢板。这四个木箱子从一九五一年就放在这个地方，经过长期的风吹雨打，现在有的钢板已经生锈了。很久以前，我曾经把这一情况写信告诉天津铁路管理局的“铁路工人报社”，可是直到现在这些东西还是“睡”在那里。
    厂矿单位应该积极指导下厂矿学生进行实习
    天津大学化工系全体研究生来信：工科学生下厂矿实习，是使理论结合实践的重要方法之一。但目前全国各厂矿没有统一的实习制度，对学生下厂矿实习的重视程度也不同，因此，到不同厂矿实习的学生的收获也就大不一样。
    有一些厂矿做得较好：像大连化学厂当有学生去实习时就设立专门的委员会负责指导，并经常组织专题演讲和辅导实习者结合厂内情况讨论；对应该保密的问题，他们也向实习者交待清楚。在该厂实习的学生都感到收获很大。
    但也有一些厂矿对下厂实习的学生不是以积极的态度给予指导和帮助。为了适应祖国大规模经济建设的需要，全国高等学校正稳步进行教学改革；搞好生产学习是其中重要环节之一。今后下厂矿实习学生数量将大大增加，建议中央高等教育部迅速和各工业部门研究出具体方案，建立健全的实习制度，加强厂矿与学校的联系。
    东北工学院不该任意抽调在学学生参加行政工作
    东北工学院竺雪娟、张裕普来信：东北工学院违反政策，连年大批抽调在学学生参加学校行政工作。我院在一九五一年抽调在学学生据不完全统计共十七人。一九五二年四月抽调了三十七人，同年十月又抽调了十六人。这些同学都是一、二年级的党团员、学生会干部或学习成绩较好的同学。他们担任的工作大部是一般行政性的工作。实际工作情况是不是十分需要这些人呢？不是。如教务科用两个人去管理资料，实际上可用资料很少，借的人也不多，一个人满够。再如做开介绍信接洽参观实习的工作也有两个人，结果就很空闲。许多被抽调的同学曾对此提出意见，我院领导同志不但不接受，反而认为提意见的同学有个人主义思想。此外，该校留用毕业生作行政、政治工作的现象也是严重的。一九五一年采矿系采煤组毕业生张绍光、机械系毕业生舒大宽留校后都做着党团工作。一九五二年毕业生中留校的就更多了，其中也有不少做政治工作或行政工作的。如冶金系周刚留校作学生科副科长、李皎留校作秘书工作。其它系也有类似情况。东北工学院这种违反统一分配和专才专用政策的做法，直接影响着国家培养技术人材的计划。建议人事部和高等教育部纠正这种现象。
    让学生日夜轮流站岗的做法是不对的
    黑龙江省绥化中学葛明来信：我们黑龙江省绥化中学有让学生日夜轮流站岗的情况。因为我县公安局要求学校有人站岗；学校限于编制，抽不出专人，只能让学生轮流站岗。现在每天夜里需要二十多个学生，每人轮流站两小时；白天光宿舍就需要七个学生，每人轮流站半天。这显然会影响学生的学习和健康。我们曾向省文教厅多次反映这个情况，但问题仍没有解决。
    汾阳县人民政府不应经常让学生停课参加社会活动
    汾阳中学段静修来信：山西省汾阳县人民政府经常让汾阳中学和汾阳师范学校的学生停课参加社会活动，影响了学校的教学工作。如该县召开各界人民代表会议时，汾阳中学和汾阳师范学校两千余同学都停课一天去欢迎农村来的人民代表。该县举行公审大会时，两校全体学生也都停课一天去参加。此外，为送往迎来或听报告而停课半天到一天的情况还很多。其实，这些活动中有很多只要学校派少数代表去参加，而不必让全校学生都停课的。希望汾阳县人民政府注意纠正这种现象。
    “国民经济实用辞典”是一本错误很多的书
    王应明来信：上海春明出版社一九五三年一月出版的“国民经济实用辞典”（苏渊雷主编）是一本错误很多的书。该书前言说，这部辞典凭着斯大林“苏联社会主义经济问题”的启示，“曾下过一番仔细而审慎的校勘工夫，增辟新的材料和修改论点不少……较为全面”。事实上，书中有些重要条目的解释是与斯大林的指示完全违背的。如“社会主义下生产资料的分配”一条中认为“计划化是社会主义的基本经济法则之一”，又错误地说价值法则以“改造过的”形态在社会主义社会中发生作用。斯大林巨著中提到的“社会主义的基本经济法则”、“现代资本主义的基本经济法则”等许多重要项目，该辞典均没有列入。书中还有不少其他的严重错误，如在“社会主义制度下的商品生产”一条中说在社会主义社会“每个工作人员的劳动报酬，并不是实物，而是货币”（其实集体农庄庄员的劳动报酬就不是如此）；在“土地改革”条中把“中华人民共和国土地改革法”误为“土地改革法草案”；而校勘上的错误也相当多。
