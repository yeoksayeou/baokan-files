The British Government Continues to Defend US Atrocities Against POWs in Order to Obtain US Dollars

(Xinhua News Agency, March 19th) The British government continues to follow the United States in defending the crimes of the American aggressors in disrupting the Korean armistice talks and massacring prisoners of war. On March 16th, the British government published a white paper on the Korean armistice talks. In this white paper, the British government, echoing the American government, denied the US responsibility for manufacturing the POW issue and delaying the armistice talks. The British government lied, saying that when the US unilaterally interrupted the armistice talks, the clause on the repatriation of prisoners of war in the draft armistice agreement had not yet been resolved. But everyone knows that as early as July 1st last year, the chief negotiator of the US side, Harrison, clearly put forward Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement as a common basis for both sides to resolve the issue of prisoners of war. This article stipulates that "At the time of the entry into effect of this Armistice Agreement, all prisoners of war then held by each side shall be released and repatriated without delay." It was none other than this same Harrison who later refused to repatriate prisoners of war in accordance with the provisions of this article, and ultimately unilaterally interrupted the negotiations on this basis. And this is just one of the countless tricks played by the US side to delay and disrupt the armistice negotiations.

The British government's white paper, based on the notorious so-called "intelligence report" of the US side, shamelessly described the bloody massacre of prisoners of war by the US side as the so-called "political war" waged by the Korean and Chinese sides using prisoners of war, in an attempt to shirk the responsibility for the massacre of prisoners of war by the US side.

People here pointed out that the lies told by the British government in the white paper are not clever and can be easily exposed. Everyone knows that although the British government is a loyal accomplice of the US aggression against Korea, it does not even have a representative in the US armistice negotiation delegation. The British government was even reprimanded by the United States for requesting to participate in the armistice negotiations. The British government also has absolutely no right to intervene in the US POW camps. Considering all these circumstances, the British government's white paper seems very ridiculous, it is nothing more than a replica of American instructions. The publication of this white paper shortly after British Foreign Secretary Eden returned from the United States is not accidental. It shows that in order to obtain US dollars, the British government is determined to continue to sacrifice the interests of the British people and follow the war policy of the United States.

### 英国政府为了取得美元的施舍  继续为美方屠杀战俘罪行辩护

    英国政府为了取得美元的施舍
    继续为美方屠杀战俘罪行辩护
    【新华社十九日讯】英国政府继续追随美国，为美国侵略者破坏朝鲜停战谈判、屠杀战俘的罪行进行辩护。三月十六日，英国政府发表了一个关于朝鲜停战谈判的白皮书。英国政府在这个白皮书中，学着美国政府的舌头，抵赖美国制造战俘问题拖延停战谈判的责任。英国政府撒谎说，在美方片面中断停战谈判的时候，停战协定草案中关于遣俘问题的一款尚未解决。可是谁都知道，早在去年七月一日，美方谈判首席代表哈利逊就明确提出了停战协定草案第五十一款，作为双方解决战俘问题的共同基础。这一款规定：“本停战协定生效时，各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返。”而后来拒绝按照这一款规定遣返战俘，并且最后借此片面中断了谈判的不是别人，正就是这个哈利逊。而这还不过是美方所玩弄的拖延和破坏停战谈判的无数花样之一。　英国政府的白皮书依据臭名远扬的美方的所谓
    “情报报告”，硬把美方对战俘的血腥屠杀，无耻地说成是朝中方面利用战俘进行所谓“政治战”，企图替美方推卸屠杀战俘的责任。
    此间人士指出，英国政府在白皮书中所撒的谎言并不高明，而且很容易被戳穿的。谁都知道，英国政府虽然是美国侵略朝鲜的忠顺帮凶，可是它在美方停战谈判代表团中却连一个代表也没有。由于要求参加停战谈判，英国政府还曾经挨过美国的申斥。英国政府对于美方战俘营也同样完全无权过问。如果考虑到所有这些情况，英国政府的白皮书就显得非常可笑，它无非是美国指令的翻版而已。这个白皮书在英国外交大臣艾登刚从美国回来以后发表，并不是偶然的。它表明英国政府为了取得美元的施舍，决心继续牺牲英国人民的利益，追随美国的战争政策。
