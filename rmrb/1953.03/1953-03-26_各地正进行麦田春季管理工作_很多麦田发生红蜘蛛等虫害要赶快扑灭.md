Farmers in winter wheat-growing areas are carrying out spring field management work for winter wheat.

In some areas of Shanxi, the experience of wheat production model Wei Mingbiao is being promoted to actively harrow and rake to preserve soil moisture, apply topdressing fertilizer, irrigate, and prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests. On March 6th, the CCP Hejin County Committee organized five wheat inspection and evaluation teams to inspect wheat field processing in various districts. Through mass evaluation, they summarized and promoted wheat high-yield experience, and promoted the masses to make material preparations for insect prevention, frost prevention, goose prevention, wind prevention, and drought prevention. The number of hoeings, spring irrigations, and topdressings required locally, as well as the quality and timing, have all been discussed by the masses and specific plans have been formulated. More than 80% of the wheat fields in Yuanqu County have been harrowed, and the wheat fields in advanced villages and mutual aid cooperative organizations have all been harrowed.

Many wheat seedlings in East China were damaged or killed by the cold wave at the beginning of December last year. According to statistics from 15 counties in Shandong, approximately one million mu of wheat seedlings were affected by frost damage. Now, farmers in various regions are adopting various methods to replant seedlings. For those with fewer missing seedlings, hoeing, raking, applying quick-acting fertilizer, irrigating, and earthing up should be carried out as early as possible to enable the existing seedlings to quickly recover. The Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, in a notice on "Doing a Good Job in Spring Wheat Field Management to Ensure Increased Wheat Production," pointed out the various different methods that should be adopted in various different situations for replanting seedlings, preserving soil moisture, applying topdressing fertilizer, and irrigating. In areas of Jiangsu Province where wheat seedlings have been damaged by frost, many farmers have carried out transplanting and replanting, and are now carrying out weeding, earthing up, and ditching and drainage.

Agricultural leading organs in Henan Province, a major wheat-producing area in the country, have paid more attention to spring field management of wheat this year, and have provided specific guidance for spring hoeing and spring raking very early on. Many areas lack fertilizer, and applying topdressing fertilizer to wheat fields means neglecting applying basal fertilizer to spring fields. Leading cadres in counties such as Xin'an, Luoyang, Wuzhi, and Qi County have all paid attention to mobilizing the masses to find fertilizer sources in various ways. The CCP Qi County Committee once convened a special meeting of district party secretaries and district heads to study the fertilizer issue, mobilizing farmers to apply topdressing fertilizer to wheat fields on the one hand, and to empty manure pits and collect soil from livestock pens on the other hand. At the same time, cooperatives purchased and supplied more than 3 million jin of cottonseed cake, bean cake, bone meal, and fertilizer powder to ensure that all wheat fields in the county were topdressed once and that basal fertilizer was not missed for spring fields. In order to encourage the county's farmers to do a good job in spring wheat field management, the Wuzhi County Farm convened a forum of production activists from various villages. Wheat production model Li Entong called on everyone to irrigate in a timely manner and to combine wheat irrigation with topdressing to maximize the effectiveness of the fertilizer.

The weather is warmer in the Nanzheng Special District of Shaanxi, and the wheat seedlings are already more than five inches high and have generally been hoeed once. Baoji Special District has also begun to hoe wheat and apply topdressing fertilizer. In order to ensure a large-scale bumper wheat harvest this year, the Xingping County leading organs sent inspection teams to the fields in early February to inspect the work of 14 high-yield wheat villages. The 85 villages in the county participating in the wheat patriotic production competition recently evaluated winter production results and exchanged spring farming experience. Douma Township, a wheat production model township in Xingping County, applied manure to all wheat fields last winter in the county's wheat high-yield red flag competition, averaging three and a half carts per mu. This spring, they actively carried out wheat field fertilization, weeding, and other work. In order to finish weeding the wheat in a timely manner, the village organized 28 temporary mutual aid groups, and farmers who had never participated in mutual aid groups in the past also began to help each other. Many mutual aid groups in Lintong, Xianyang, Changwu, Fuping and other counties have made preparations for wheat field frost prevention.

A serious problem at present is that only a few areas have paid attention to and implemented spring field management of winter wheat. In Shanxi Province, with more than 17 million mu of wheat fields, only a very few counties have paid attention to wheat field management. In southern Shanxi, the thinking of many farmers of "emphasizing cotton and neglecting wheat" is still very serious. Farmers in many areas still follow the habit of planting this year and harvesting next year, with little or no processing in between. Various regions should, in the patriotic production increase competition movement, combine with local realities, promote advanced experience, and use local examples of increased production due to attention to processing to promote the masses to improve farming methods.

Another serious problem is that many wheat fields have generally been infested with pests such as spider mites, wheat aphids, and wheat leaf bees, with spider mites being the most harmful, having become a major threat to striving for a bumper wheat harvest. Areas where insect pests have been found include more than 30 counties in the six special districts of Xinxiang, Luoyang, Nanyang, Xuchang, Zhengzhou, and Anyang in Henan, various counties in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, various counties in the Yuncheng Special District of Shanxi, the eastern region of Shandong, and the southern region of Jiangsu. As the weather gradually warms, the insect pests in these areas are still increasing and are spreading to nearby areas. However, only a few areas have paid attention to carrying out prevention and control work; in other areas, most of the insecticides and machinery have not yet been distributed to farmers. Agricultural leading organs and technical guidance personnel in areas where insect pests have already occurred and in areas where insect pests have not yet been found should quickly pay attention to this issue, closely monitor the situation of insect pests, and help and mobilize the masses to prevent, control, and eliminate them as quickly as possible.

### 各地正进行麦田春季管理工作  很多麦田发生红蜘蛛等虫害要赶快扑灭

    各地正进行麦田春季管理工作
    很多麦田发生红蜘蛛等虫害要赶快扑灭
    种植冬小麦的地区的农民，正在进行冬小麦的春季田间管理工作。
    山西部分地区正在推广小麦丰产模范魏名标的经验，积极地耙耱保墒、上追肥、浇水、防治病虫害。中共河津县委三月六日组织了五个小麦检查评比组，到各区检查麦田加工工作，通过群众性的评比，总结、推广小麦丰产经验，并推动群众作了防虫、防霜、防雁、防风、防旱的物质准备。对于当地锄麦、春浇、追肥应有的次数、质量、时间，都经过群众讨论，定出了具体的方案。垣曲县已有百分之八十以上的麦田实行了耙耱，先进的村子和互助合作组织的麦田已经全部耙过。
    华东各地的麦苗，在去年十二月初寒潮侵袭时，有许多冻坏或冻死了。据山东十五个县统计，约有一百万亩左右的麦苗受到冻害。现在各地农民正在采用各种办法补苗。缺苗较少的，及早进行锄耙、追施速效肥料和浇水、培土，以使现有的麦苗迅速恢复生机。山东省人民政府农林厅在“做好春季麦田管理工作保证小麦增产”的通知中，指出了在各种不同情况下应当采取的各种不同的补苗、保墒、追肥、浇水的办法。江苏省麦苗受冻害的地区，许多农民进行了移苗、补种等工作，现正进行锄草、壅土、开沟排水等工作。
    全国小麦主要产区河南省的农业领导机关，今年对于小麦的春季田间管理工作比较重视，对于春锄春耙很早就进行了具体的指导。很多地区肥料不足，顾了麦田施追肥就顾不了春田施基肥；新安、洛阳、武陟、淇县等县领导干部都注意了发动群众多方面寻找肥料来源。中共淇县县委曾召集各区区委书记和区长专门研究了肥料问题，发动农民一方面往麦田施追肥，一方面腾粪坑、拉圈土；同时由合作社代购和供应棉饼、豆饼、骨粉、肥田粉等共三百多万斤，保证全县麦田全部施一次追肥，并且不误春地施基肥。武陟县农场为了带动全县农民群众做好麦田春季管理工作，召集各村生产积极分子开了座谈会。小麦丰产模范李恩同号召大家及时浇水，并且把浇麦和施追肥结合起来，使肥料发挥更大的作用。
    陕西南郑专区天气较暖，麦苗已高达五寸以上，一般都已锄了一遍；宝鸡专区也已开始锄麦、施追肥。为了保证今年小麦大面积丰产，兴平县领导机关二月初就派出检查组，深入田间检查了十四个小麦丰产村的工作；全县参加小麦爱国丰产竞赛的八十五个村，最近已评比了冬季生产成绩，交流了春季耕作经验。兴平县小麦丰产模范乡窦马乡，去冬在全县小麦丰产红旗竞赛中就给全部麦田上了粪，平均每亩三车半，今年一开春，又积极进行了麦田施肥锄草等工作。为了及时锄完麦子，该村又组织起二十八个临时互助组，过去从未参加过互助组的农民也开始互助起来了。临潼、?阳、长武、富平等县许多互助组已经做了麦田防霜的准备。
    当前的一个严重问题是只有少数地区注意和实行了冬小麦春季田间管理工作。山西省全省有一千七百多万亩麦田，只有极少数几个县重视了麦田管理工作。晋南许多农民“重棉轻麦”的思想仍很严重。许多地区的农民还是沿袭着今年播种来年收割的习惯，中间很少加工或根本不加工。各地应当在爱国丰产竞赛运动中，结合本地实际情况，推广先进经验，用当地由于注意加工而增产的实例，推动群众改进耕作方法。
    另一个严重问题是很多麦田普遍发生了红蜘蛛、麦蚜虫、麦叶蜂等虫害，其中以红蜘蛛为害最重，已经成为争取小麦丰产的主要威胁。已发现虫害的地区有河南新乡、洛阳、南阳、许昌、郑州、安阳六个专区的三十多个县，陕西关中地区各县，山西运城专区各县，山东东部地区，江苏南部地区。天气渐渐暖和了，这些地区的虫害还在增加，并且正向附近地区蔓延。但是只有少数地区注意进行了防治工作；其他地区的除虫药械大部分还没有发放到农民手里。已发生虫害的地区和还未发现虫害的地区的农业领导机关和技术指导人员，都应赶快注意这个问题，密切注意虫害的情况，用最快的速度，帮助和发动群众加以防治和扑灭。
