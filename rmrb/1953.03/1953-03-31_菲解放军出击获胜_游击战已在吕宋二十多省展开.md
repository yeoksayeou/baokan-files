    Philippine People's Liberation Army Launches Successful Attacks
    Guerrilla Warfare Spreads to More Than Twenty Provinces in Luzon
    Manila News: The Philippine People's Liberation Army annihilated the garrison of a Quirino puppet army outpost at Minami Misita Port in Quezon Province on March 22nd. The People's Liberation Army occupied this seaport town and主动撤出 retreated on their own initiative after seizing a large quantity of military supplies.
    On the same day, the Philippine People's Liberation Army conducted an ambush in Cavite Province, thirty miles south of Manila, killing and wounding several policemen of the Quirino puppet government.
Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The Philippine People's Liberation Army, fighting heroically for national independence and freedom, is constantly developing and giving the Quirino puppet government's troops a strong blow in an increasingly wide range. On Luzon, the largest island in the Philippines, the Philippine People's Liberation Army has not only established consolidated base areas in provinces such as Pampanga, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, and Bulacan, but has also launched guerrilla warfare in twenty-two of the twenty-four provinces of Luzon. In an article published in the "Manila Times" weekly on January 11th this year, Quirino puppet army Chief of Staff Duque revealed that in 1952, the puppet army fought the Philippine People's Liberation Army more than 3,600 times throughout the country. This number is more than double the 1,559 battles in 1951. The "Philippine News Agency," which belongs to the Quirino puppet government, also had to admit that the activities of the Philippine People's Liberation Army were "becoming more and more frequent."
    The Quirino puppet army carried out frequent "sweeping campaigns" in an attempt to eliminate the People's Liberation Army, but they all suffered shameful failures. In January of this year, the Quirino government again greatly touted a "comprehensive sweeping campaign." An Associated Press dispatch from Manila on March 23rd pointed out that the outcome of this "sweeping campaign" is still unknown.
    The Philippine People's Liberation Army has won the support of the broad masses of the people, which is one of the most important factors for their inevitable victory. The "Philippine News Agency" also had to admit that the Philippine People's Liberation Army "is deeply sympathetic and praised by the people of Pampanga Province." A spokesman for the Quirino puppet army once revealed that when the Quirino army launched attacks, farmers often set wildfires to notify the Philippine People's Liberation Army in the nearby mountains.
    The US imperialists and their running dogs used various means of bloody suppression, but they did not frighten the broad masses of the Philippine people. On the contrary, the Philippine workers and peasants are more closely united around the Communist Party of the Philippines and the Philippine People's Liberation Army it leads.

    菲解放军出击获胜
    游击战已在吕宋二十多省展开
     【新华社二十八日讯】马尼拉消息：菲律宾人民解放军三月二十二日在奎松省消灭了民那米示沓港一个季里诺傀儡军哨所的驻军。人民解放军占领了这个海港市镇，在缴获了大批军用物资后主动撤出。
    同日，菲律宾人民解放军在马尼拉南方三十英里甲米地省内进行一场伏击战，打死打伤季里诺傀儡政府的警察多名。 【新华社二十八日讯】为争取民族独立自由而英勇战斗的菲律宾人民解放军正在不断发展，并在越来越广阔的范围给季里诺傀儡政府的军队以有力的打击。在菲律宾最大岛屿——吕宋，菲律宾人民解放军不仅在邦邦牙、丹辘、新怡西夏和武捞干等省建立了巩固的根据地，而且在全吕宋二十四个省中的二十二个省开展了游击战。今年一月十一日，季里诺傀儡军参谋长杜克在“马尼拉时报”星期刊发表的一篇文章里透露：在一九五二年内，傀儡军在全国各地和菲律宾人民解放军作战的次数超过了三千六百次。这个数字比一九五一年的作战次数一千五百五十九次增加了一倍以上。属于季里诺傀儡政府的“菲律宾通讯社”也不得不承认：菲律宾人民解放军的活动“越来越频繁了”。
    季里诺傀儡军进行频繁的“扫荡战”，企图消灭人民解放军，但是都遭到了可耻的失败。今年一月间，季里诺政府又大事吹嘘地进行“全面扫荡”。美联社马尼拉三月二十三日电指出：这次“扫荡战”的结果到现在还没有下文。
    菲律宾人民解放军得到了广大人民的拥护，是他们必然获得胜利的最重要的因素之一。“菲律宾通讯社”也不得不承认：菲律宾人民解放军“深得邦邦牙省人的同情和赞扬”。季里诺傀儡军发言人曾经透露：当季里诺军队出击时，农民们经常放野火通知附近山地上的菲律宾人民解放军。
    美帝国主义者和他们的走狗使用了各种血腥镇压的手段，但没有把菲律宾广大人民吓倒。相反，菲律宾工人和农民更加紧密地团结在菲律宾共产党和它所领导的菲律宾人民解放军的周围。
