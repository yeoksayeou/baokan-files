The North China Bureau Office forwarded a letter from the CPC Datong Municipal Committee Office: The letter from all farmers of the South Zhaizi Farmers' Association Group of the Second Farmers' Association of Chengguan District, Fengzhen County, Suiyuan Province (published in the "Letters from Readers" column of this newspaper on February 4) raising opinions on the local state-owned coal mines in Zuoyun County, has been checked by us and is basically correct. The coal mine did have the phenomenon of short weighing when selling coal to farmers, and some staff members had a bad attitude towards the masses. We have sent cadres to the coal mine to mobilize the masses to continue to expose problems in order to improve the work of the coal mine.

    中共大同市委办公室着手改进左云县煤窑的工作
    华北局办公厅转来中共大同市委办公室来信：绥远省丰镇县城关区第二农民协会南栅子里农会小组全体农民来信（刊二月四日本报“读者来信”栏）对左云县地方国营煤窑提出的意见，经我们检查，基本上是正确的。该窑卖炭给农民时确有短秤现象，还有些工作人员对群众态度不好。我们已派干部到该窑发动群众继续揭发问题，以求改进该窑工作。
