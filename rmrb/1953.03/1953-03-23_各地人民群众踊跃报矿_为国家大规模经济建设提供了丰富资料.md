    People Across the Country Enthusiastically Report Mineral Deposits
    Providing Rich Data for National Large-Scale Economic Construction
    [This newspaper reports] People across the country are enthusiastically concerned about the nation's large-scale economic construction and are reporting to the People's Government about the underground treasures they have discovered. Since the establishment of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government in September of last year, it has received 407 letters from people across the country reporting mineral deposits by the end of February this year. Those reporting included workers, farmers, students, soldiers, and cadres. The types of mineral deposits reported included 39 kinds, such as iron, coal, copper, oil, manganese, chromium, lead, zinc, silver, gold, tungsten, tin, antimony, platinum, aluminum, cobalt, barium, fluorite, gemstones, quartz, crystal, mica, asbestos, phosphorus, arsenic, sulfur, graphite, and emery. The reported mineral deposits are distributed in 27 provinces, totaling 809 locations.
    The enthusiastic reporting of mineral deposits by the people has provided rich data for the country's economic construction. The Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government has preliminarily studied the letters from the people reporting mineral deposits and has tested and identified some of the attached samples, discovering many important clues. For example, Zhang Quan, a cadre of the Guangling County People's Government in Shanxi Province, reported that there was an iron mine in his hometown, Da Hongshan Mountain in Huai'an County, Hebei Province. Based on his letter, the Central Geological Department requested samples of the Da Hongshan iron ore from the Huai'an County People's Government. Preliminary identification showed that it was similar to the ore from the Longyan Iron Mine in Hebei Province, and further investigation revealed similar ore outcrops in several nearby counties. This provided important data for expanding the mining area of the Longyan Iron Mine. Zhuang Shengqing, a farmer from Miyanshan Township, Zhangshui District, Yin County, Zhejiang Province, picked up a shiny little stone washed down from the mountain during a flood in his hometown in 1947. Last year, he suspected that the stone was a mineral. He remembered that he had accidentally crushed a stone on Huangnigang and Longshan mountains in Dajiao Township several times, and the cross-section of the stone was black, which might also be a mineral. So he picked up a piece of this stone and sent it along with the shiny little stone he had kept to the Central Geological Department. The Central Geological Department preliminarily studied the samples sent by Zhuang Shengqing and determined that the shiny little stone was high-quality hematite. In May 1952, civilian workers in Sucheng City, Anhui Province, discovered many mineral stones while digging a river north of the city at a depth of more than five meters. Writing on the wall with this mineral stone at night produced a shimmering green light that lasted for a long time, and this mineral stone would spontaneously combust when taken out of the water and exposed to air. Zhang Tianmin, a cadre of the Sucheng City People's Government, wrote to the Central Geological Department to report this situation, and the Central Geological Department identified the mineral stone as natural yellow phosphorus. Subsequently, Hou Guibin, a public security officer from the Xuzhou Railway Sub-bureau, also wrote to the Central Geological Department to report the discovery of phosphate rock near Xuzhou.
    The enthusiastic reporting of mineral deposits by the people reveals their excitement about the start of the country's large-scale economic construction. Many people tirelessly reported any mineral deposit clues they could recall to the People's Government, and some even climbed mountains and waded through rivers to conduct on-site investigations of mineral deposits for the country. Jin Guanyang, a soldier of the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and three others discovered a significant error in the magnetic compass every time they flew over a certain mountainous area. They suspected that there was a large magnetite deposit underground and reported this situation to the Central Geological Department. Zhang Xuemin, a demobilized soldier from the Xiayang Town Cooperative in Nanping County, Fujian Province, specifically used Sundays to climb mountains to look for minerals and has reported his discovery of mica and other minerals to the Central Geological Department twice. After reading the news of the National Geological Conference in the newspaper, four convalescents from the Xuzhou Cadre Sanatorium immediately reported nine mineral deposits they knew about to the Central Geological Department. In addition, some people have contributed their preserved geological mineral maps and mineral deposit data; others have made suggestions on how to carry out mass reporting of mineral deposits.
    Although the work of mass reporting of mineral deposits has achieved great results, except for the Northeast region, the work of mass reporting of mineral deposits in other areas is still in a spontaneous state, lacking necessary leadership and organization. Although the Ministry of Geology of the Central Government has set up a general survey group within the Geological Department and designated a special person to be responsible for handling letters from the masses reporting mineral deposits, it still lacks a set of methods for organizing the masses to report mineral deposits, so that the work of mass reporting of mineral deposits cannot be widely carried out with leadership and organization. From many letters from the masses reporting mineral deposits, it can be seen that some people have been subjected to blows and sarcasm when reporting mineral deposits and collecting mineral samples, which has caused them to have concerns; some people lack the common sense to identify mineral maps, which has increased the difficulty of reporting mineral deposits. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen publicity on the work of mass reporting of mineral deposits. In the publicity work, on the one hand, it is necessary to eliminate the concerns of the masses, and on the other hand, some general mineral knowledge should be introduced. In order to seriously deal with the mass reporting of mineral deposits, so that the country can understand and utilize underground resources in a timely manner, the geological departments should organize a certain force to conduct key investigations of the mineral deposits reported by the masses, or instruct the field teams in the relevant areas to conduct investigations, so as not to leave the mineral deposits reported by the masses on paper materials. In addition, giving certain rewards according to the value of mass reporting of mineral deposits, and appropriately solving the difficulty of lacking postage for sending mineral samples when the masses report mineral deposits are also necessary measures to carry out the work of mass reporting of mineral deposits.

    各地人民群众踊跃报矿
    为国家大规模经济建设提供了丰富资料
    【本报讯】全国各地人民群众热烈关怀国家大规模经济建设，纷纷向人民政府报告他们发现的国家地下的宝藏。中央人民政府地质部从去年九月成立以来，到今年二月底为止，已接到各地人民群众报矿信件四百零七件。报矿的包括工人、农民、学生、战士和干部。报告的矿苗的种类有铁、煤、铜、石油、锰、铬、铅、锌、银、金、钨、锡、锑、白金、铝、钴、钡、萤石、宝石、石英、水晶、云母、石绵、磷、砷、硫、石墨、金刚砂等三十九种。报告的矿藏分布在二十七个省份，共有八百零九处。
    人民群众踊跃报矿，为国家的经济建设提供了丰富的资料。中央人民政府地质部初步研究了人民群众报矿的信件，并化验鉴定了若干附送的标本，发现了许多重要的线索。如山西省广灵县人民政府干部张全报告他的故乡河北省怀安县大红山有铁矿。中央地质部根据他的来信，向怀安县人民政府索取大红山铁矿标本，初步鉴定与河北省龙烟铁矿的矿石相似，并又进一步发现了附近几个县都有类似的矿石露头。这就为扩大龙烟铁矿的矿区提供了重要的资料。浙江省鄞县章水区密岩乡农民庄生卿，一九四七年在家乡发洪水时拣着一块从山上冲下来的亮晶晶的小石头。去年，他怀疑这石头是一种矿石，又想到有几次在大皎乡黄泥岗和龙山两处山上无意中捣碎一块石头，石头的断面呈黑色，可能也是矿石，于是就拣了一块这种石头，和自己保存的亮晶晶的小石头一齐寄到中央地质部。中央地质部初步研究了庄生卿寄来的标本，判断其中亮晶晶的小石头是质量很好的赤铁矿。安徽省宿城市民工一九五二年五月在市北挖河，挖至五公尺多深时，发现了许多矿石。用这种矿石夜间在墙上写字，字迹闪闪发绿光长久不散，而且这种矿石从水中取出时，遇到空气就自动燃烧。宿城市人民政府干部张天敏写信给中央地质部报告这种情况，中央地质部鉴定这种矿石是自然黄磷。随后，徐州铁路分局公安员侯桂彬也写信给中央地质部报告在徐州附近发现的磷石。
    人民群众踊跃报矿，流露了他们对国家开始大规模经济建设的兴奋心情。许多人不厌其烦地把自己回忆所及的矿藏线索报告人民政府，有些人甚至爬山涉水，自动为国家实地调查矿藏。中国人民解放军空军战士金冠扬等四人每次飞过某山地上空时，发现磁罗盘有很大的差误。他们怀疑地下有较大的磁铁矿，就将这个情况向中央地质部报告了。福建省南平县峡阳镇合作社转业军人张学敏特地利用星期日爬山找矿，已先后两次向中央地质部报告他所发现的云母等矿石。徐州干部疗养院四个休养员读了报纸刊载的全国地质会议的新闻后，当时就将他们所知道的九处矿产向中央地质部报告了。另外，还有的群众献出了自己保存的地质矿产图和矿藏资料；有的对如何开展群众报矿工作提出建议。
    人民群众报矿工作虽已取得很大成绩，但是除东北地区外，各地人民群众报矿工作还是处于自流的状态，还缺乏必要的领导和组织。中央地质部虽然在地质司内设立了普查组，指定专人负责处理群众报矿的来信，也仍然缺少一套组织群众报矿的办法，以致使群众报矿工作不能有领导有组织地广泛开展。从许多群众报矿的来信中可以看到，有些人在报矿和采集矿石标本时，曾受到打击和讽刺，使他们产生了顾虑；有些人缺乏识别矿图的常识，增加了报矿的困难。因此，必须加强宣传群众报矿工作。在宣传工作中，一方面要解除群众的顾虑，一方面应介绍一些一般的矿产常识。为了认真处理群众报矿，使国家及时了解和利用地下资源，地质部门应组织一定的力量对群众报告的矿藏进行重点调查，或者责成有关地区的野外队进行调查，免得使群众报告的矿藏，停留在纸面的材料上。此外，分别群众报矿的价值，给以一定的奖励，并适当解决群众报矿时投寄矿石标本缺乏邮资的困难，也都是开展群众报矿工作的必要措施。
