Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 29th. On March 26th, the US side again beat to death one of our captured personnel on Pi-do Island. According to the US side, the reason this POW was beaten to death was because "someone saw" him putting a so-called "document" inside his shirt. Because he could not produce this fabricated "document," he was beaten to death. The US side did not say who exactly saw this so-called "document." But it is clear from this that the US side has deployed many spies in their POW camps – so-called "informers" – and with the assistance of these spies, is arbitrarily murdering POWs who firmly refuse to be detained.

    美方又在蜂岩岛杀害战俘
    【新华社开城二十九日电】三月二十六日美方又在蜂岩岛打死我方被俘人员一名。据美方宣布，这名战俘所以被打死，是因为“有人看到”他把一个所谓“文件”放进衬衣里，由于他交不出这个莫须有的“文件”，他就被打死了。美方没有说出这个所谓“文件”究竟是什么人看到的。但从这里可以清楚地看出，美方在他们的战俘营中布置了许多特务——所谓“告密”的人，并且正在这些特务的协助之下，任意杀害坚决拒绝被扣留的战俘。
