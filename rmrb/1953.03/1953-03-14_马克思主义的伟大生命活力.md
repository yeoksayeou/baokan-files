    The Great Vitality of Marxism
    By A. Lihelate, Soviet Union

    March 14, 1953, marks the 70th anniversary of the death of Karl Marx, the founder of scientific communism, a brilliant thinker, and the great leader and teacher of the world's proletariat.

    Marx's greatest achievement lies in his discovery of the objective laws of development of capitalist society, revealing its profound internal contradictions, and scientifically proving the inevitable demise of capitalism and the inevitability of the victory of the communist social system. Based on the summary of the experience of the working-class struggle, Marx demonstrated the role of the proletariat, the most advanced class in human history, with its worldwide historical significance, bearing the mission to fundamentally transform social relations, eliminate capitalist enslavement, eliminate the phenomenon of human exploitation, and create a new communist society.

    Before Marx, the revolutionary movement of the working class was groping in the dark. At that time, the proletariat did not understand the true path to liberation from capitalist oppression. They also did not have their own scientific worldview, their own political party, or their own true leaders. Only after Karl Marx and his comrade Engels appeared on the political stage did the working class gain their great teachers and leaders.

    Marx and Engels were the founders of the proletarian revolutionary worldview—dialectical materialism. Marx applied dialectical materialism to the study of social history, thus creating historical materialism, the science of the laws of social development, and the science of the laws of class struggle. Dialectical materialism and historical materialism are the greatest achievements of scientific thought, a true revolution in science, philosophy, and the understanding of the world, and a fundamental transformation in the previously dominant ideas about nature and society. Marxism opened the way to understanding and mastering the laws of social development using scientific methods, and it opened the way to transforming the most advanced class in society—the proletariat—into conscious creators of history. Marx and Engels proved that all written history of mankind is a history of class struggle, and the existence of struggling classes in society is related to the irreconcilable contradictions inherent in the development of material production under the dominance of private ownership of the means of production. They also proved that the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will inevitably intensify, and this intensification of struggle will inevitably lead to the overthrow of the bourgeoisie by force, to the proletariat's seizure of power by revolutionary means, and to the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    Marxism scientifically proves that the working class's hatred for the capitalist order will inevitably turn into a struggle to overthrow capitalism by revolutionary means, into a struggle to replace capitalism with socialism; it also proves that the proletariat struggling against the bourgeoisie will defeat the bourgeoisie because the ever-increasing expansion of production and the socialization of labor associated with the development of capitalism provide the material conditions for the proletariat to replace capitalism with socialism.

    To achieve victory, the proletariat must understand the conditions and methods of struggle. Marx and Engels instructed that the proletariat must have its own political party—the communist vanguard, which is the most determined and progressive part of the workers, theoretically understanding the conditions, course, and general results of the proletarian movement better than the rest of the proletarian masses. The victory of the working class in the struggle for socialism is closely linked to the leadership activities of the proletarian party—the Communist Party.

    In the "Communist Manifesto" published in 1848, Marx and Engels for the first time expounded the principles of scientific communism. This is the first programmatic document of scientific communism. This work clearly embodies the unity of theory and practice that runs through the entire Marxist doctrine. Since the advent of Marxism, science has become the theoretical weapon of millions of proletarian masses fighting for socialism. Marx and Engels for the first time combined socialism with the workers' movement and linked revolutionary theory with revolutionary practice.

    The entire history of mankind in the past century has confirmed the great vitality of scientific communism. Lenin wrote: "Marx's doctrine is omnipotent because it is true. It is complete and harmonious, providing people with a complete worldview that is irreconcilable with any superstition, any reaction, or any ideas that defend bourgeois oppression." (Selected Works of Lenin, Two-Volume Edition, Volume 1, Chinese Edition, p. 69.)

    Under the conditions of the new historical era—the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution—Lenin and Stalin defended the great Marxist doctrine in an irreconcilable struggle against various opportunists of the Second International, developing this doctrine to suit the new conditions of the proletarian class struggle. Lenin and Stalin creatively developed Marxism and enriched it with great discoveries that played a decisive role in the working class's victorious struggle for socialism.

    Based on an in-depth scientific analysis of imperialism, Lenin created a new and complete theory of socialist revolution—namely, the doctrine that socialism can first triumph in several, even in one individual country. Stalin developed Lenin's theory of socialist revolution and demonstrated the possibility of building a communist society in the Soviet Union even when capitalist encirclement still exists. Lenin and Stalin comprehensively studied the doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the doctrine of the Communist Party. In the flames of revolutionary struggle, they created and tempered the Marxist party of the proletariat, the party of a new type—the Communist Party—embodying the wisdom, honor, and conscience of the present era. The great Lenin discovered that Soviet power is the state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, created the doctrine of the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the proletariat, and the doctrine that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the highest form of democracy. Lenin and Stalin studied and pointed out the roads and methods of building socialism during the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin and Stalin comprehensively developed the Marxist doctrine—the science of the laws of natural and social development, the science of revolution of the oppressed and the exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, and the science of building a Communist society, and raised the significance of this doctrine to a higher level.

    The great October Socialist Revolution was the great triumph of Marxism-Leninism. History has never seen such a brilliant verification of scientific theory by the revolutionary struggle practice of life and millions of working people. The world's first state of working people created by Lenin and Stalin, and the victory of the Soviet people in building socialism in the Soviet Union under Stalin's inspiration, are vivid manifestations of the immortal ideas of scientific communism.

    Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, defended Marxism-Leninism in a relentless struggle against all kinds of opportunists and enemies of the people—Trotskyites, Zinovievites, Bukharinites, and bourgeois nationalists, creatively developed it, and enriched it with the experience of the Soviet working class's victorious struggle in building socialism.

    Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the Soviet Union has been transformed in a short historical period into a powerful industrial and collective farm power; in this country, the exploitation of man by man has been eliminated forever, and a solid new socialist system has been established; this system has no crises, unemployment, or the poverty of working people, and it guarantees the continuous rise of the people's cultural and material well-being. The Soviet Union, where the ideas of Marxism-Leninism occupy a dominant position, is a country with advanced science and culture, a country of true humanism and progress. In the Soviet Union, the socialist democracy of the whole people has been widely developed, and such powerful driving forces as the moral and political unity of Soviet society, the friendship of all nationalities, and Soviet patriotism have been developed.

    The great transformations realized in the Soviet state point out to all nations that the era of capitalism has come to an end, and now all roads lead to communism.

    The Soviet Union's world-historical victory over fascist Germany and imperialist Japan saved mankind from the threat of fascist enslavement. This victory enabled the people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and North Korea to take their destiny into their own hands and establish people's democratic systems in their own countries that carry out the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and guarantee the successful construction of socialism. In China, the great people's revolution achieved victory. Now, the people's democratic regime in China is victoriously completing the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal tasks, preparing the conditions for the transition to socialist development. The peace-loving German Democratic Republic is advancing along the path of rapid economic and cultural development. As the Second World War fundamentally changed the international situation, countries with a population of 800 million have broken away from the chains of imperialism and formed a powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the great Soviet Union. The Soviet state is an indestructible fortress of democracy and socialism and a reliable pillar of all progressive forces of mankind. It does its best to stop the war-mongers of the US and UK, to defend peace throughout the world. Its international prestige has grown immeasurably. Marxism-Leninism points out to all nations the path to escape the scourge of war and imperialism, to escape poverty, bankruptcy, and death. While the countries of the socialist and democratic camp are advancing along the path of rapid economic and cultural development, the irreconcilable contradictions of the capitalist world are becoming sharper than before, the preparations for a new world war are being strengthened, and the threat of economic turmoil is growing.

    With the help of the lackeys of imperialism—the right-wing social democrats—the ruling groups of the US and UK are attempting to form a new alliance of colonial powers—modern slave owners—who oppress the people of Asia and Africa. Now, the crisis of the entire imperialist colonial system is becoming sharper. Millions of working people in colonies and dependent countries, who make up the majority of the world's population, have risen to actively participate in political life and in the struggle for freedom and independence. The awakening of the Asian people and their victories in the national liberation struggle mark the victory of Lenin and Stalin's theory of socialist revolution. The great anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutions unfolding in colonies and dependent countries have shattered all the evil plans of the US and UK imperialists. Now, no force can stop the forward march of the people's liberation struggle. In capitalist countries, the Communist Parties, loyal to the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, are leading the people in the struggle against war-mongers, for peace and democracy, and to defend the freedom and national sovereignty of their countries. All progressive mankind, the working people of all countries, approve and support the peace-loving policies of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries uphold the cause of peace and the security of the people, and the cause of effective cooperation among all countries.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are realizing the great program of building a communist society in the Soviet Union, planned by Stalin, the scientific giant of Marxism-Leninism.

    Comrade Stalin's brilliant works, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and Stalin's speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, illuminate the road to communism for the Soviet people with the brilliant light of revolutionary theory, illuminate the road to freedom and happiness for all working people of mankind, and answer the most pressing questions that move all nations and all people who advocate peace and progress.

    Comrade Stalin's revelation of the basic economic law of modern capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism gives a fatal blow to all the defenders of capitalism. "These basic economic laws prove," Comrade Malenkov pointed out, "that in capitalist society, man is subject to the ruthless law of extracting maximum profit, and therefore people are doomed to suffer heavy hardship, poverty, unemployment, and bloody wars; while in socialist society, all production is subject to man and his ever-increasing needs. This is the decisive superiority of the new social system—communism—which is more advanced than capitalism." (Malenkov: Summary Report at the Nineteenth Party Congress, People's Publishing House Edition, p. 104.)

    Now, the communist doctrine has become a great force, confirmed by life, for the people of all countries to transform the world and conquer nature, to expand the sources of livelihood for the working people. It has become a force that liberates mankind from the oppression of exploiters, crises and wars, poverty and unemployment, and points out to the working people the only correct path to escape the disasters brought about by imperialism. Comrade Stalin taught that the law of modern historical development is: the continuous growth of the influence of the Communist Party as the most determined defender of the interests of the working people in all countries and the most determined fighter for peace, national freedom and independence. Now, only the Communist Party can raise the banner of democratic freedom, national independence and national sovereignty.

    The achievements of the Soviet Union in building communism, the consolidation and prosperity of the democratic and socialist camp, and the powerful upsurge of the struggle of all peoples against the reactionary forces of imperialism and war-mongers and for peace, freedom, and democracy are proof of the great vitality of the invincible ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Every new historical era brings Marxism even more glorious victories. The time of the inevitable death of capitalism, which is doomed by history, is near. Just as communism is bound to win a complete victory, the death of capitalism is inevitable.

    马克思主义的伟大生命活力
    苏联  阿·李赫拉特
    一九五三年三月十四日是科学共产主义的创始人，天才的思想家，世界无产阶级的伟大领袖与导师卡尔·马克思逝世七十周年纪念日。
    马克思最伟大的功绩就在于，他发现了资本主义社会发展的客观规律，揭明了它深刻的内部矛盾并科学地证明了资本主义不可避免的灭亡及共产主义社会制度胜利的必然性。马克思根据对工人阶级斗争经验的总结，论证了人类历史上最先进的阶级——无产阶级的全世界历史意义的作用，这个阶级负有使命来根本改造社会关系，消灭资本主义奴役，消灭人剥削人的现象并创造新的共产主义社会。
    马克思以前的工人阶级革命运动是在黑暗中摸索进行的。当时无产阶级尚不了解摆脱资本压迫的真正道路。他们也还没有自己的科学世界观，没有自己的政党，没有自己真正的领袖。只有在卡尔·马克思及其战友恩格斯出现于政治舞台之后，工人阶级才获得自己伟大的导师与领袖。
    马克思和恩格斯是无产阶级革命世界观——辩证唯物主义的创始人。马克思将辩证唯物主义应用于研究社会历史，从而创造了历史唯物主义，关于社会发展规律的科学，关于阶级斗争规律的科学。辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义是科学思想的最大成就，是科学、哲学以及认识世界方面的真正革命，是以前占优势的关于自然与社会观念中的根本变革。马克思主义开辟了用科学方法认识社会发展规律并掌握它们的道路，开辟了把社会上最先进的阶级——无产阶级——变成历史的自觉创造者的道路。马克思与恩格斯证明，人类全部成文的历史，都是阶级斗争的历史，社会中斗争着的各阶级之存在，是与在生产资料私有制占统治地位下物质生产发展所固有的不可调和的矛盾相联系的。他们又证明，无产阶级与资产阶级之间的斗争，不可避免地要日益尖锐化，而这种斗争的尖锐化必然会引向用暴力推翻资产阶级的统治，引向无产阶级用革命手段夺取政权，引向无产阶级专政的确立。
    马克思主义科学地证明，工人阶级对资本主义秩序的愤恨，一定会变成争取用革命手段推翻资本主义的斗争，变成用社会主义来代替资本主义的斗争；它又证明，为反对资产阶级而斗争的无产阶级将要战胜资产阶级，因为，与资本主义发展相联系的生产的日益扩大及劳动的社会化，为无产阶级用社会主义代替资本主义提供着物质条件。
    为了取得胜利，无产阶级就必须了解斗争的条件与方法。马克思和恩格斯曾指示过，无产阶级必须有自己的政党——共产主义先锋队，它是工人中最坚决最前进的部分，是对于无产阶级运动的条件、进程及一般结果的理论认识优越于其他无产阶级群众的部分。工人阶级争取社会主义斗争的胜利，是与无产阶级政党——共产党的领导活动密切联系着的。
    在一八四八年发表的“共产党宣言”中，马克思和恩格斯首次阐述了科学共产主义的原理。这是科学共产主义的第一个纲领性的文件。在这本著作中显明地体现了贯穿着全部马克思主义学说的理论与实践的统一。自从有了马克思主义，科学便成为千百万为争取社会主义而斗争的无产阶级群众的理论武器。马克思和恩格斯第一次地把社会主义同工人运动结合起来，把革命理论同革命实践联系起来。
    近百年来人类的全部历史证实了科学共产主义的伟大的生命活力。列宁写道：“马克思学说之所以万能，就是因为它正确。它十分完备而严整，给了人们一个决不同任何迷信、任何反动、任何辩护资产阶级压迫的思想相调和的完整世界观。”（列宁文选两卷集，第一卷，中文版第六十九页。）
    在新的历史时代——帝国主义与无产阶级革命时代——的条件下，列宁和斯大林在与第二国际各种机会主义者的不调和的斗争中保卫了伟大的马克思主义学说，发展了这一学说使之适合于无产阶级阶级斗争的新条件。列宁和斯大林创造地发展了马克思主义，并以各种伟大的发现丰富了它，这些伟大的发现在工人阶级争取社会主义的胜利斗争中曾起了决定性的作用。
    列宁根据对帝国主义的深入的科学分析，创造了新的、完整的社会主义革命理论——即关于社会主义可能首先在几个，甚至在个别国家内取得胜利的学说。斯大林发展了列宁关于社会主义革命的理论并论证了即使在资本主义包围仍然存在的情况下苏联建成共产主义社会的可能性。列宁与斯大林全面地研究了关于无产阶级专政的学说，关于共产党的学说。他们在革命斗争的烈火中创建并锻炼了体现着当代的智慧、荣誉和良心的无产阶级的马克思主义政党，新型的党——共产党。伟大的列宁发现了苏维埃政权是无产阶级专政的国家形式，创造了无产阶级领导下工农联盟的学说，以及无产阶级专政是民主的最高形式的学说。列宁与斯大林研究并指出了在无产阶级专政时期建设社会主义的道路与方法。列宁与斯大林全面地发展了马克思主义的学说——即关于自然及社会发展规律的科学，关于被压迫与被剥削群众革命的科学，关于社会主义在一切国家获胜的科学，关于建设共产主义社会的科学，并将这一学说的意义提到更高的高度。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命便是马克思主义—列宁主义的伟大凯旋。历史上还没有看见过生活及千百万劳动者群众的革命斗争实践对科学理论的这种辉煌的验证。列宁、斯大林所创建的世界上第一个劳动者的国家，以及苏联人民在斯大林的鼓舞下在苏联建设社会主义的胜利，便是科学共产主义不朽思想的生动表现。
    列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林在与各种机会主义及人民的敌人——托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子、布哈林分子及资产阶级民族主义者——的无情斗争中维护了马克思主义—列宁主义，创造地发展了它，以苏联工人阶级建成社会主义的胜利斗争经验丰富了它。
    在列宁—斯大林的党的领导下，苏联在短短的历史时期内变成为强大的工业和集体农庄的强国；在这个国度里，永远消灭了人对人的剥削，建立起牢固的新的社会主义制度；这种制度没有危机、失业和劳动者的贫困，保证人民的文化和物质福利的不断高涨。马克思列宁主义的思想占居统治地位的苏联，是具有先进科学和文化的国家，是真正人道主义和进步的国家。在苏联，全民的社会主义的民主得到了广泛的开展，苏维埃社会道义上和政治上的一致、各民族的友谊和苏维埃爱国主义等这样一些强大的动力，都发展了起来。
    苏维埃国家中所实现的伟大的改造向一切民族指出：资本主义时代已告结束，现在条条道路都是通向共产主义。
    苏联对法西斯德国和帝国主义日本的全世界历史性的胜利，把人类从法西斯奴役的威胁中拯救了出来。这一胜利使波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚和北朝鲜的人民能够掌握自己的命运，在自己的国家里建立起执行无产阶级专政的职能和保证成功地建设社会主义的人民民主制度。在中国，伟大的人民革命取得了胜利。现在，中国的人民民主政权正在胜利地完成反帝、反封建的任务，准备着过渡到社会主义发展的条件。爱好和平的德意志民主共和国正沿着经济和文化迅速发展的道路前进。由于第二次世界大战根本改变了国际局势，已有拥有八亿人民的国家从帝国主义的链环中脱出，组成了以伟大的苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义的强大阵营。苏维埃国家是民主和社会主义的不可摧毁的堡垒和人类一切进步力量的可靠支柱，它尽力制止美、英战争挑拨者，保卫全世界的和平，它的国际威信已无比地增长。马克思列宁主义向一切民族指出了摆脱战争的惨祸和帝国主义，摆脱贫穷、破产和死亡的道路。在社会主义和民主阵营各国沿着经济和文化迅速发展的道路前进的时候，资本主义世界的不可调和的矛盾比以前更加尖锐起来，新世界战争的准备加强了，经济动荡的威胁增长了。
    在帝国主义的走狗——右翼社会党人的帮助之下，美、英统治集团企图结成一个压迫亚、非两洲人民的现代奴隶主——殖民强国的新联盟。现在，整个帝国主义殖民制度的危机更加尖锐起来。占地球多数人口的殖民地和附属国的千百万劳动人民已起来积极参加政治生活，参加争取自由和独立的斗争。亚洲人民的觉醒及他们在民族解放斗争中的胜利，标志着列宁、斯大林的社会主义革命理论的胜利。在殖民地和附属国里开展着的伟大的反帝、反封建革命，粉碎了美、英帝国主义者的一切罪恶的打算。现在，没有任何力量能够阻止人民解放斗争的前进的进程。在资本主义国家里，忠实于马克思列宁主义的伟大学说的共产党，正领导着人民进行反对战争挑拨者、争取和平和民主的斗争，卫护自己国家的自由和民族主权。全体进步人类，世界各国的劳动者都赞成和支持苏联和各人民民主国家的爱好和平的政策，苏联和各人民民主国家坚持和平和人民安全的事业，坚持一切国家有效合作的事业。
    在共产党领导下的苏联人民，正在苏联实现着由马克思列宁主义的科学巨师斯大林所规划的建设共产主义社会的伟大纲领。
    斯大林同志的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和斯大林在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说，以革命理论的灿烂光辉照耀着苏联人民走向共产主义的道路，照耀着人类所有劳动者走向自由和幸福的道路，解答了激动着一切民族、一切拥护和平和进步的人们的当前最迫切的问题。
    斯大林同志关于现代资本主义基本经济法则和社会主义基本经济法则的揭示，给予资本主义的一切辩护者以致命的打击。“这些基本经济法则证明，——马林科夫同志指出——，在资本主义社会里，人是服从于榨取最大限度利润的无情法则的，因而人们注定要遭受沉重的苦难、贫穷、失业和流血的战争；而在社会主义社会里，全部生产都是服从人及其不断增长的需要的。比资本主义更高级的新的社会制度——共产主义——的有决定意义的优越性就在于此。”（马林科夫：在第十九次党代表大会上的总结报告，人民出版社版，第一○四页。）
    现在，共产主义学说已成为一切国家人民改造世界和征服自然、扩大劳动者的生活福利源泉的、已为生活证实了的伟大力量。它已成为一种把人类从剥削者的压迫、危机和战争、贫穷和失业中解放出来，并给劳动者指出摆脱帝国主义所带来的灾难的唯一正确道路的力量。斯大林同志教导说，现代历史发展的法则就是：作为一切国家里劳动者利益的最坚决的卫护者及争取和平、民族自由和独立的最坚决的战士的共产党的影响的不断增长。现在，只有共产党能够高举起民主的自由、各民族的民族独立和民族主权的旗帜。
    苏联建设共产主义的成就，民主和社会主义阵营各国的巩固与繁荣，各族人民反对帝国主义反动势力和战争挑拨者与争取和平、自由、民主的斗争的强大的高涨，是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的战无不胜的思想的伟大的生命活力的证明。每一个新的历史时代都带给马克思主义以更为光辉的胜利。为历史所注定的资本主义的必不可免的死亡的时候已临近了。正像共产主义必然要获得彻底的胜利一样，资本主义的死亡是必不可免的。
