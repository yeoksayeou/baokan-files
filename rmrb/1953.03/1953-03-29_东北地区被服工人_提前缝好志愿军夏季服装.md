Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th. Clothing workers in Northeast China have completed the task of sewing summer uniforms for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army ahead of schedule. Starting in late February, large quantities of summer clothing have been successively shipped to the Korean front lines.

After accepting the task of sewing summer uniforms for the Volunteer Army, the clothing workers in Northeast China extensively launched red banner competitions, with everyone ensuring that this year's summer uniforms would be made both exquisite and sturdy, and delivered to the Korean front lines as early as possible. During the red banner competition, workers actively sought out tips and improved their skills, enthusiastically completing production tasks. Guan Yuying, the wife of Volunteer Army soldier Cai Changzhen, learned the continuous operation method created by Jiang Wanshou, increasing production efficiency to more than double the quota. Workers in the fourth workshop of a certain clothing factory found 37 tips in the competition, enabling the entire workshop to complete January's production task five days and two hours ahead of schedule, and driving the entire factory to complete the production task two days ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota by 8%.

Railway workers in Northeast China, when transporting summer uniforms for the Volunteer Army, demonstrated a high degree of creativity and improved the loading methods, allowing each freight car to carry 60 more packages of clothing than last year. This not only saved the country transportation resources but also enabled this batch of summer clothing to be transported to the Korean front lines more quickly.

According to Xinhua News Agency: More than 3,700 workers in a sewing factory in Wuhan City recently completed the work of sewing summer uniforms for a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The workers demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity in sewing this batch of single-layer clothing. To make these clothes sturdy, comfortable, and beautiful, sewing each set of single-layer military uniforms was divided into 72 procedures. The workers launched a movement to find tips and tap potential, and production teams in each workshop formulated patriotic pledges. To improve and increase sewing output, the workers painstakingly researched and invented 24 kinds of sewing machine parts. During the sewing of this batch of military uniforms, both output and quality continuously improved. For example, the eighth workshop used to produce only 800 sets of clothes per day, and there were still many reworked items; now it can produce 1,700 sets of clothes per day, and the rework rate has dropped from 1.04% to 0.29%.

Before this batch of military uniforms was shipped to the Korean front lines, the workers put needle and thread kits in the pockets of each garment, containing a square of cloth, six yards of thread, and two needles; they also attached a letter to the most beloved people, which read: "There are still many shortcomings in the clothing we have made. What are your opinions? What needs to be improved? Please give us your suggestions and send them to us, and we will definitely improve our work based on your opinions."

    东北地区被服工人
    提前缝好志愿军夏季服装
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】　东北地区被服工人提前完成了为中国人民志愿军缝制夏季服装的任务。从二月下旬开始，大批夏季服装已陆续运往朝鲜前线。
    东北地区被服工人们，在接受了缝制志愿军夏季服装的任务后，就广泛开展了红旗竞赛，人人保证把今年的夏季服装做得又精致又结实，提早送到朝鲜前线。在红旗竞赛期间，工人们纷纷寻找窍门和提高技术，热情地完成生产任务。志愿军战士蔡常珍的妻子关玉英学会了姜万寿创造的连续操作法，使生产效率超过定额一倍。某被服厂第四车间工人们在竞赛中找出了三十七个窍门，使全车间一月份生产任务提前五天零两小时完成，并带动全厂提前两天并超额百分之八完成了生产任务。
    东北地区的铁路工人，在运输供应志愿军的夏季服装时，发挥了高度的创造性，改进了装车方法，使每节车皮较去年多装六十包服装。这不仅为国家节省了运输力量，而且可以更快地将这批夏季服装运到朝鲜前线。
    据新华社讯：武汉市某缝纫工厂的三千七百多名工人，最近已完成了为中国人民志愿军某部缝制夏季服装的工作。工人们在缝制这批单衣时发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。为了把这些衣服做得结实、舒适、美观，缝成每套单军装共分了七十二个工序。工人们开展了找窍门、挖潜力的运动，各车间的生产小组都订立了爱国公约。为了改进和提高缝制的产量，工人们苦心钻研，发明了二十四种缝纫机上的零件。在缝制这批军装时，产量、质量都不断提高。如第八车间过去每天只能生产八百套衣服，而且还有很多返工活；现在每天能生产一千七百套衣服，返工率由百分之一点零四，降到百分之零点二九。
    当这批军衣运往朝鲜前线之前，工人们在每件衣服的口袋里，都装上了针线包，里面是一方尺布、六码线、两颗针；同时还附了一封信给最可爱的人，信上说：“我们制作的被服还有很多缺点，你们有那些意见？有那些需要改进的地方？请你们多多提出并寄给我们，我们一定根据你们的意见来改进工作。”
