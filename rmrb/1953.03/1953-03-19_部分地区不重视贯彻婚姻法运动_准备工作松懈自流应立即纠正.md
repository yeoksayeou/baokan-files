Some Regions Neglect the Implementation of the Marriage Law Movement
Preparation Work is Lax and Unsupervised and Should Be Corrected Immediately

The large-scale publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law movement is about to unfold nationwide. The leading organs of most provinces, cities, and counties across the country attach great importance to this movement, have established Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees, have conducted pilot projects, trained or are training cadres, and have achieved results and gained experience. However, there are still a few regions where leading organs and leading cadres have insufficient understanding of the political significance of publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law, and have not yet started work or have failed to earnestly prepare for various tasks.

The situation in these regions is as follows: The first category is failing to assign tasks, allowing things to drift. For example, in twelve counties in Sichuan Province, including Xinjin, Leshan, Yongchuan, and Longchang, committees or offices have not yet been established. In some cities and counties of Songjiang Province, the heads of the Propaganda Departments of the Party committees and the directors of the Women's Federations merely relayed the information after returning from meetings in the province. Up until now, they have not established organizations for the Marriage Law Implementation Movement, and various preparatory tasks have not been carried out well. In Jiangxi Province, among the relevant departments of the Nanchang Prefecture Administrative Office and the Prefectural Party Committee, only the Women's Federation and the People's Court have taken action, with the Prefectural Party Committee's Propaganda Department issuing an instruction, but other departments have remained inactive. When Shicheng County in the same province convened a joint meeting of district chiefs and district Party committee secretaries, they assigned work on everything, but did not mention the issue of implementing the Marriage Law at all. A few counties and cities in Anhui Province have not yet established Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees. When the Dangtu County Party Committee in the same province assigned work tasks for this year, it also failed to mention the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law. Leading organs in Quzhou Prefecture, Qu County, and Wuxing County in Zhejiang Province have never studied this work. Some leading cadres in Shaoxing County believe that there is no need to establish a special organization for the implementation of the Marriage Law. Leading cadres in Wangdu County, Hebei Province, instructed district cadres by saying, "When you go back, make proper arrangements for production, Party rectification, and the implementation of the Marriage Law." This lacked clear and specific instructions. As a result, during group discussions, district cadres did not understand the movement's guiding principles and policies. Some even believed that "the policy might be that men and women who are not old enough cannot get married." And the cadres in charge of the county did not discover these problems. Because the leading organs in these areas let this work drift, deviations have occurred in the work. For example, Yan'an County, Shaanxi Province, adopted the erroneous approach of simply imposing punishments during pilot projects.

The second category is mutual buck-passing, with no one taking responsibility. For example, in Songjiang and Anhui provinces, some counties completely push the Marriage Law Implementation Movement to the courts or women's federations, while others want to dissolve the offices, and the preparatory work and key pilot projects have not been completed. Individual counties are preparing not to conduct key pilot projects, nor are they preparing to train cadres. In some areas, the cooperation between units is very poor, and the steps are extremely chaotic. The Women's Federation of the Yuexi District in Guangdong Province once requested Haikang County to send three cadres to participate in the key pilot project in Naliang Township, Lianjiang County, but the Haikang County Committee firmly disagreed. The Haikang County Women's Federation originally wanted to hold training classes for Marriage Law propagandists and marriage registration staff, but had to abandon the idea due to lack of funding.

The third category is setting up institutions in name only, without substance. In some counties of the Huanggang Prefecture in Hubei Province, the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee has not held a single meeting since its establishment, and no one is specifically responsible for the office. After the establishment of the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee in Tong County Prefecture, Hebei Province, it has neither convened a formal meeting nor seriously studied the instructions from higher authorities, let alone formulated a comprehensive plan. The Tong County Prefectural Party Committee originally determined that the staff of the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee office would be eleven people, but in reality, only three or four people were doing the work, and they also concurrently managed the work of the original organ. Therefore, after the centralized training of cadres in various counties began at the end of last year, by the end of February this year, some counties had almost completed it, but the office still did not understand the overall situation. The offices in various counties of the prefecture are also nominal, with no one specifically responsible. When the prefecture wants to contact the counties, it often doesn't know who to look for. Although institutions have been established at the provincial and municipal levels and at most prefectural levels in the southwest provinces and cities, many prefectural-level Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees only have two or three cadres to cope with daily work. The Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee in the Yuexi District of Guangdong Province was established in December last year, and the first meeting was held in mid-January this year. Of the fifteen members, only four attended. Although the committee nominally has fifteen people, the actual work is only done by a few cadres from the Women's Federation. The Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees in Wuhu Prefecture and Bengbu City, Anhui Province, have not established offices for more than half a month after their establishment, and no full-time cadres are responsible for daily work. Wuhu City established a committee at the end of last year, but the first meeting to study the division of labor was not held until the end of January this year, and the office that should have been established under it has not yet been established. Although some regions in Zhejiang Province have also established Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committees, the cadres have not been fully equipped, or incompetent cadres have been assigned, and they cannot carry out the work well.

The main reason for the above-mentioned situation is that the leading cadres in these areas mistakenly believe that "Since it is a publicity and education policy and a long-term task, we can take our time." Some believe that "This is just a matter for the Women's Federation, why make it a big movement!" Others excuse themselves by saying "There is a lot of work and few cadres," saying that "the Marriage Law movement cannot be carried out well." If these situations are not corrected immediately, they will inevitably lead to serious drift and cause deviations in the movement. Therefore, all regions should seize the opportunity to inspect and correct, so as to ensure that the Marriage Law Implementation Movement is carried out steadily and forcefully.

    部分地区不重视贯彻婚姻法运动
    准备工作松懈自流应立即纠正
    大规模宣传贯彻婚姻法运动即将在全国范围内展开。全国大部分省、市、县的领导机关，对这一运动都很重视，成立了贯彻婚姻法运动委员会，进行了典型试验工作，训练了或正在训练干部，并取得了成绩和经验。但是，仍有少数地区的领导机关和领导干部，对宣传贯彻婚姻法的政治意义认识不足，尚未开展工作或未能认真做好各项准备工作。
    这些地区的情况是：第一类，不布置工作，放任自流。如四川省新津、乐山、永川、隆昌等十二个县，至今尚未建立委员会或办公室。松江省有的市、县的党委宣传部长和妇联主任从省开会回去，仅作了传达，到现在还没有成立贯彻婚姻法运动的机构，各项准备工作也没有很好的进行。江西省南昌专署、地委有关部门中，除妇联会和人民法院外，只有地委宣传部发了一个指示，其他部门一直未动。该省石城县召开区长、区委书记联席会议时，什么工作都布置了，关于贯彻婚姻法的问题则一句未提。安徽省少数县、市至今没有成立贯彻婚姻法运动委员会。该省当涂县委在布置今年工作任务时，对宣传贯彻婚姻法也是一字未提。浙江省衢州专区、衢县、吴兴县等地领导机关一直没有研究过这一工作。绍兴县的某些领导干部，则认为没有成立贯彻婚姻法专门机构的必要。河北省望都县领导干部向区干部布置说：“你们回去把生产、整党、贯彻婚姻法这几个工作好好安排一下。”缺乏明确具体的交代。结果，区干部在分组讨论时，对运动的方针、政策都不懂。有的甚至认为，“政策，可能是男女不够年龄不能结婚”。而该县负责干部并没有发现这些问题。由于这些地区的领导机关任这一工作自流，所以工作中就发生了偏向。如陕西省延安县进行典型试验中，就曾采取了单纯惩罚的错误做法。
    第二类是互相推诿，无人负责。如松江、安徽两省，有的县把贯彻婚姻法运动完全推给法院或妇联去作，有的县想解散办公室，到现在准备工作和重点试验工作都没做好。个别县则准备不做重点试验工作，也不准备训练干部。有些地区，各单位的互相配合很差，步调极为混乱。广东省粤西区妇联曾要求海康县派出三个干部参加廉江县那良乡的重点试验工作，海康县委会坚不同意。海康县妇联原想举办婚姻法宣传员和婚姻登记员训练班，因没有经费，只好作罢。
    第三类是虚设机构，有名无实。湖北省黄冈专区有的县贯彻婚姻法运动委员会成立后，至今没有开过一次会，办公室也无专人负责。河北省通县专区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会成立后，既没召开过一次正式会议，也没认真研究过上级的指示，更未订出通盘计划。通县地委原确定贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室的工作人员是十一个人，而实际上做工作的只有三、四人，且兼管原机关工作。因此，各县集训干部在去年年底开始后，到今年二月末，有的县已接近结束，但办公室还不了解全面情况。该专区各县的办公室也是有名无实，没有专人负责。专区要和各县联系，往往不知道找谁。西南各省市一级和大部专区级虽已成立机构，但很多专区级的贯彻婚姻法运动委员会只有两三个干部应付日常工作。广东省粤西区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会在去年十二月成立，今年一月中旬开第一次会议，十五个委员中，到会的只有四人。该委员会虽名义上有十五人，实际做工作的只是妇联的几个干部。安徽省芜湖专区和蚌埠市两地贯彻婚姻法运动委员会成立半个多月还没有建立办公室，无一专职干部负责日常工作。芜湖市在去年底就成立了委员会，但到今年一月底才开第一次会议研究分工问题，其下应设的办公室至今仍未成立。浙江省有些地区虽也建立了贯彻婚姻法运动委员会，但干部尚未配备齐全，或配上不称职的干部，不能很好地开展工作。
    产生上述情况的主要原因，是这些地区的领导干部错误地认为：“既然是宣传教育方针，又是长期工作，就慢慢来好了。”有的认为：“这不过是妇联的事，何必搞成大运动！”也有的借口“工作多，干部少”，说“婚姻法运动没法搞好”。这些情况如不立即纠正，势必形成严重的自流现象，并使运动发生偏向。因此，各地应抓紧时机、检查纠正，以保证贯彻婚姻法运动稳健地有力地开展起来。
