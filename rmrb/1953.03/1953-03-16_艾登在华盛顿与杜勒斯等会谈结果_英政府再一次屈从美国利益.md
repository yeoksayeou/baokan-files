Xinhua News Agency, Washington: After arriving in Washington on the 4th, British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler held consecutive meetings with US Secretary of State Dulles, Treasury Secretary Humphrey, Mutual Security Agency Director Stassen, and other US government officials.

The communique issued on the 7th indicated that in these talks, Britain once again succumbed to American pressure on its Far East policy in exchange for so-called American support for Britain in the Middle East and the Iranian oil issue. On issues that Britain had high hopes for, such as the US relaxing import and export restrictions and increasing economic aid, the US did not undertake any obligations.

The communique stated that Eden declared that the British government had decided to follow the US in strengthening the so-called embargo policy, taking steps to prevent British ships from carrying so-called strategic materials to mainland China, and would try to prevent ships of any country carrying such materials from refueling in British ports. In exchange: the United States expressed its support for the proposal submitted by Britain to the Iranian government in February to resolve the oil dispute. According to this proposal, Britain will receive a "compensation fee," and Britain will recognize Iran's "nationalization" of oil. It is worth noting that the communique emphasized that the resolution of the dispute should give Iran "full opportunity" to sell its oil, and Iran will receive a loan to meet its financial needs, which will be repaid with oil. This will actually be the United States providing a sum of money for the Iranian government to give to Britain as "compensation" for Britain's abandonment of its claims to Iranian oil interests, while the United States will seize Britain's monopoly rights over Iranian oil.

Britain was also led by the nose to jointly declare with the United States in the communique that they were "concerned" about the "expeditious ratification" of the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty. The only empty "comfort" the United States gave Britain was to express that the use of military bases within British territory in "emergency" situations would be "jointly decided" with Britain.

On economic issues, the communique revealed that no specific agreement was reached at the meeting. After listening to the British report on the results of the Federal Prime Ministers' Conference, the US side refused to undertake any specific obligations, only stating that it would continue to "study" the British proposals. The US attitude towards its British "friends" was particularly evident in the communique's mention of the British proposal to lower US trade barriers. The communique emphasized twice that promoting trade would be in accordance with the principles stipulated by Eisenhower in his State of the Union address, that is, opening the door to American goods and capital, but any measures by the United States to adjust trade restrictions must be premised on "protecting" the profits of American capitalists.

### 艾登在华盛顿与杜勒斯等会谈结果  英政府再一次屈从美国利益

    艾登在华盛顿与杜勒斯等会谈结果
    英政府再一次屈从美国利益
    【新华社讯】华盛顿消息：英国外交大臣艾登和财政大臣巴特勒在四日到达华盛顿后，连日和美国国务卿杜勒斯、财政部长汉弗莱、共同安全署长史塔生以及其他美国政府官员举行了会谈。
      七日发表的会议公报表明，在这次会谈中，英国在远东政策上再一次屈从于美国的压力，以换取美国在中东和伊朗石油问题上给予英国的所谓支持。在英国寄望很高的要求美国放松进出口限制、增加经济援助等问题上，美国未承担任何义务。
    公报说，艾登声明英国政府决定追随美国的加强所谓禁运的政策，采取步骤不让英国船只载运所谓战略物资到中国大陆，并将设法不给任何国家载运这种物资的船只在英国港口加煤。作为交换条件的是：美国表示支持英国在今年二月向伊朗政府提出的解决石油争执的建议，根据这个建议，英国将可得到一笔“补偿费”，同时英国将承认伊朗石油的
    “国有化”。值得注意的是，公报强调争执的解决要使伊朗得有“充分机会”出售它的石油，并且伊朗将得到一笔贷款以应付财政需要，这笔贷款将以石油偿还。这实际上将是美国出一笔钱，由伊朗政府给英国作为英国放弃对伊朗石油权益的要求的
    “补偿”，而美国就夺取了英国对伊朗石油的垄断权益。
    英国还被牵着鼻子在公报里和美国共同声明“关心”所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约的“尽速批准”。美国给英国的一点空洞的“慰藉”是表示在“紧急”时使用英国境内的军事基地将和英国“共同决定”。
    在经济问题方面，公报透露会议未达成任何具体协议。美国方面在听取了英方关于联邦总理会议的结果的报告之后，拒绝承担任何具体义务，只表示将继续“研究”英国的建议。美国对待它的英国
    “朋友”的立场在公报提到关于英国所提的降低美国贸易壁垒的问题时表现得特别明显。公报两次强调，促进贸易将按照艾森豪威尔在他的国情咨文中所规定的原则，就是让别人对美国货物和资本敞开大门，但美国的任何调整贸易限制的措施都必须以
    “保护”美国大资本家的利润为前提。
