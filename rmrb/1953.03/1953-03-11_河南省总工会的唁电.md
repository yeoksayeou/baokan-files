To the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions:

We are deeply saddened to hear of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world and a dear friend of the Chinese people. The workers of Henan Province, like the working people of the world, are filled with immense grief. The passing of Comrade Stalin is an incalculable loss for the working people of the world. We are determined to transform our grief into strength with steadfast confidence. Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, we will further strengthen the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, diligently learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and actively engage in production, using our practical actions to mourn Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. We hereby send our condolences.
