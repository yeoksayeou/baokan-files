    Central Administration for Industry and Commerce Should Reply with the Results of the Hearing Aid Review
    Zhuang Mingshan writes: I criticized the former Central Private Enterprise Bureau for not replying for a long time after reviewing my invented hearing aid. You published my letter in the "Main Points of Readers' Letters of the Week" on January 8th. However, up to now, the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce has still not dealt with this matter. This attitude of ignoring the masses' letters published in the newspaper is absolutely unacceptable.
    Editor's Note: We hope that the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce will promptly inform us of the situation and results of the review of Zhuang Mingshan's invented hearing aid.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中央工商行政管理局应答复审查助听器的结果
    庄鸣山来信：我批评原中央私营企业局审查我所发明的助听器长久不复的来信，你们在一月八日“一周读者来信主要情况”中发表了。但是至今为止，中央工商行政管理局对此事仍不处理。这种对报纸上发表的群众来信不闻不理的态度，是决不能容许的。
    编者按：希望中央工商行政管理局迅速把审查庄鸣山发明的助听器的情况及结果告诉我们。
