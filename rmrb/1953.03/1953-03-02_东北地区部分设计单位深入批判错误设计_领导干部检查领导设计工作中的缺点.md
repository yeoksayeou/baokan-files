    Some design units in Northeast China are conducting in-depth reviews of their design work and continuing to criticize typical erroneous designs. Leading cadres have also made self-criticisms during the review. They have begun to recognize that the primary causes of these erroneous designs are not only the bourgeois design thinking and lack of responsibility of the design personnel, but also that the failure to correct these errors in a timely manner, and even the long-term failure to discover them, is due to the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres in the design departments and their lack of in-depth study of the profession.

    Leading cadres of the Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, during the review, recognized the harm of the bureaucratic style of only assigning tasks without checking their execution. For example, the design of the No. 4 Electrical Engineering Factory's medium-sized motor factory used a steel structure. During this review, it was discovered that the Soviet expert's design for the same factory used a reinforced concrete structure. According to preliminary statistics, the design errors of the medium-sized motor factory alone wasted 3 billion yuan. Many errors occurred during the construction of the No. 11 Machinery Factory. At that time, the leading cadres of the design company proposed to the former Design Department of the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government that these errors were caused by the construction department not following the construction drawings. During this review, it was discovered that some construction errors were caused by incorrect construction drawings. Originally, during the design phase, some designers, in order to rush the task, simplified twenty-one construction drawings into five, causing the construction personnel to be unable to understand them and making mistakes in the project. At that time, the leading cadres of the design company even promoted this lazy method of erroneously simplifying construction drawings as an advanced working method. Design personnel Shen Jie confessed: "I initially did not want to adopt this method of simplifying construction drawings, but the leaders criticized me for 'not learning from advanced experiences,' so I blindly adopted this method. This kind of construction drawing cannot be used as a blueprint for construction at all."

    The review revealed that the past task-oriented view in leading design work was very serious. Leading personnel of the Northeast Building Materials Industry Bureau, in order to complete the task as soon as possible, did not conduct overall design or geological exploration, and produced the erroneous design of the First Ceramics Factory. Many designs by the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau and the Chemical Industry Bureau lacked complete geological data and were also approved. The leaders of these bureaus asked: "What if collecting more data delays the task?" Leading cadres of the Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry discovered that many designs lacked sufficient data, but under the control of a purely task-oriented view, they had to say: Design according to the existing situation! Zhu Guoping, manager of the design company, reflected on this purely task-oriented view: "In the past, I did not understand the basic requirements of the superior instructions, especially for basic construction, which were 'good, fast, and economical.' I always thought that 'good cannot be fast, and fast cannot be good,' and even simply emphasized speed while ignoring quality."

    At present, many leading cadres have not studied their profession in depth. They always think that "they are transferred cadres and cannot learn technology well," and regard technology as a mysterious thing and do not care about it. As a result, design personnel feel that there is no leadership in technology, and many erroneous designs have not been corrected in time. Some design errors are not due to technical problems, but due to the designers' carelessness and irresponsibility. As long as the leadership conducts a serious review, these can be avoided. The design of the cotton cleaning workshop of the Jinzhou Textile Factory was not based on geological data. If the leadership had reviewed it, this erroneous design could have been corrected. The cotton cleaning workshop, which was built according to this erroneous design, cannot be put into production.

    In the past, leading cadres in many departments also often called on everyone to learn from Soviet advanced experiences, but lacked specific leadership. There was also little specific criticism of the incorrect thinking of design personnel in learning from Soviet advanced experiences. Some leading cadres only generally emphasized the importance of learning from Soviet advanced experiences, but rarely specifically explained the advantages of Soviet advanced experiences from the content of one or two engineering designs, and explained why Soviet advanced experiences should be learned. The work of some design units in learning from Soviet advanced experiences was uncontrolled. Some designers in the Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry spontaneously formed groups to study Soviet advanced experiences, but the leadership did not provide leadership.

    东北地区部分设计单位深入批判错误设计
    领导干部检查领导设计工作中的缺点
    东北地区部分设计单位深入检查设计工作，继续对典型的错误设计进行批判。领导干部在检查中也进行了检讨。他们已开始认识到：这些错误设计产生的主要原因，固然是设计人员存在着资产阶级的设计思想和对工作不负责任，但是，这些错误设计所以没有及时得到纠正，甚至长期没有被发现，却是因为设计部门的领导干部有官僚主义作风，没有钻研业务。
    中央重工业部设计公司的领导干部在检查中，认识了过去只布置任务而不检查执行情况的官僚主义的危害性。如电工四厂中型电机厂设计成为钢结构，在这次检查中，发现苏联专家设计同样的工厂，是采用钢筋混凝土结构。据初步统计，仅中型电机厂设计的错误，就浪费了三十亿元。在修建第十一机械厂时，发生了很多错误。当时设计公司的领导干部向原东北人民政府工业部设计处提出，这是施工部门不按施工图施工产生的错误。在这次检查中，才发现有些施工上的错误，是施工图不正确所造成的。原来在设计时，有些设计人员为了赶任务，把二十一张施工图，简化为五张，以致施工人员看不懂，把工程做错了。当时设计公司领导干部还把这个错误地简化施工图的偷懒方法，当作先进的工作方法来推广。设计人员沈杰检讨说：“我起先不愿意采用这种简化施工图的方法，但是领导同志批评我‘不学习先进经验’，于是我也盲目地采用了这个方法。这种施工图根本不能作为施工的蓝本。”
    检查中发现：过去领导设计工作中的单纯任务观点是很严重的。东北建筑材料工业管理局领导人员为了早日完成任务，不做总体设计，不进行地质钻探，就做出了第一陶瓷厂的错误设计。东北有色金属管理局和化学工业管理局的许多设计，缺乏完整的地质资料，也被批准了。这些局的领导人员提出：“要多方面搜集资料，耽误了任务怎么办？”中央重工业部设计公司的领导干部发现很多设计没有足够的资料，但在单纯任务观点支配下，也只好说：根据现有情况设计吧！设计公司经理朱国平检讨这种单纯任务观点时说：“过去对上级指示，特别是对基本建设的基本要求，‘又好、又快、又省’，没有很好地领会，总以为‘好就不能快，快就不能好’，甚至单纯强调进度，而忽视了质量。”
    现在还有不少领导干部没有钻研业务。他们总认为“自己是转业干部，学不好技术”，把技术看成神秘的东西，不去过问。因而使设计人员感到在技术上没有人领导，使很多错误的设计没有及时得到纠正。有些设计的错误，并不是由于技术上发生了问题，而是由于设计人员马虎草率、不负责任。只要领导方面认真地加以检查，是可以避免的。锦州纺织厂清花车间的设计，没有地质资料作根据，如果领导方面审查一下，这个错误设计是可以纠正的。现在按照这个错误设计做出的清花车间，不能进行生产。
    过去许多部门的领导干部也常常号召大家学习苏联先进经验，但缺乏具体领导。对于设计人员在学习苏联先进经验中存在的不正确的思想，也很少具体地加以批判。有些领导干部只一般地强调学习苏联先进经验的重要性，但很少从一两个工程设计的内容具体地说明苏联先进经验的优越性，说明为什么要学习苏联先进经验。有些设计单位学习苏联先进经验的工作是自流的。中央重工业部设计公司有些设计人员自发地组成学习苏联先进经验的小组，但是领导方面并没有加以领导。
