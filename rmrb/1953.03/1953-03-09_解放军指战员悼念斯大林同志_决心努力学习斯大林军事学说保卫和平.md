Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The broad commanders, fighters, and staff of all military regions and services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army mourn the passing of the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, Marshal Stalin, with utmost sorrow.

After hearing the news of Marshal Stalin's unfortunate passing, many cadres and soldiers of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army wept with grief. Commanders and fighters of various units of the Southwest Military Region, upon hearing this unfortunate news, resolved to consolidate the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance and defend peace in the East and the world through practical actions. Subordinate organs, logistics units, public security forces, and the military region guard battalion of the Sichuan Military Region, upon hearing this unfortunate news, immediately convened revolutionary soldier meetings to stand in silent tribute. Representatives of the First Accelerated Middle School of the Southwest Military Region, who were participating in the teaching representative conference, stood in solemn silence and sang the Internationale in tribute. Combat heroes Wei Xiaotang, Feng Laigen, Zeng Xiande, and others studying at the Second Accelerated Middle School and a certain infantry school of the Yunnan Military Region expressed their determination to transform grief into strength, study culture well, master modern military technology, take the Soviet army as an example, and strive to defend the border, consolidate national defense, and support the victory of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Combat heroes and meritorious personnel of the Henan Military Region held a memorial service on the 7th. The famous combat hero and first-class meritorious individual, Lou Qingxin, and assassination hero Li Yuxi delivered eulogies at the meeting. They unanimously stated: We will strive to study Stalin's invincible military theories and be ready at any time to give a fatal blow to the imperialists who dare to launch wars of aggression. The Political Department of the Xinjiang Military Region and the directly subordinate Party Committee of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Communist Party of China jointly issued a notice on the 6th regarding mourning the passing of Marshal Stalin, calling on all commanders and fighters to transform grief into strength, to always unite with the Soviet people, continue to heighten vigilance, and fight to the end for world peace and the cause of democracy. All commanders and fighters of the Hubei Military Region expressed their determination to study Comrade Stalin's military theories diligently, strengthen national defense construction, and work with the Soviet people to consolidate lasting world peace.

Combat heroes and literary and art workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have written articles to mourn Marshal Stalin. The famous combat hero Zhang Ming wrote an article entitled "Comrade Stalin Will Live Forever in Our Hearts":

"I still deeply remember the impression left on us when our Chinese youth delegation visited the Soviet Union in 1951. In the revolutionary history exhibition halls of Leningrad and Stalingrad, it was recorded that during the most difficult years of 1918 and 1919, Comrade Stalin personally commanded the poorly equipped Soviet army, defeating the counter-revolutionary army and foreign interventionists who had a great advantage in equipment and numbers. In the Moscow Museum, we saw a very touching oil painting depicting Marshal Stalin working tirelessly through the night to personally direct the battle during the Soviet Patriotic War for the happiness of the working people of the world and for the complete elimination of fascist bandits. These gave me a deep impression: Stalin is a banner of victory. He is like a lighthouse in the ocean, illuminating the path of struggle for the working people of the world." Zhang Ming wrote at the end of his eulogy: "Here, I swear to Comrade Stalin: We must, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, resolutely study the advanced military science of the Soviet Union, skillfully master the weapons of modern warfare and the command techniques of combined arms operations, and rapidly move towards modernization; and resolutely and forever stand with the Soviet people to fight to the end to defend world peace and the glorious cause of communism."

Combat hero Liu Zilin wrote an article entitled "Fight to the End for Stalin's Cause": "I will resolutely study Comrade Stalin's great revolutionary spirit and be a staunch fighter for the cause of communism and the defense of world peace."

Shen Ximeng, Bai Wen, Gu Yin, and other literary and art workers of the troops who once traveled through the Soviet Union to Berlin to participate in the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival in 1951, wrote in their eulogy: "Our most beloved leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin, will live forever in our hearts and in our cause."

    【新华社八日讯】中国人民解放军各军区、各兵种部队广大指挥员、战斗员和机关工作人员以万分沉痛的心情悼念全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林大元帅的逝世。
    中国人民解放军东北军区政治部的干部和战士们在听到斯大林大元帅不幸逝世的消息后，许多人都悲痛得哭了。西南军区各部队的指挥员和战斗员听到这一不幸消息后，决心以实际行动巩固中苏友好同盟保卫东方及世界和平。四川军区直属机关、后勤部队、公安部队、军区警卫营等单位，在听到这
    一不幸消息后，随即分别召集了革命军人大会默念致哀。正在参加教学代表会议的西南军区第一速成中学的代表们，全体肃立唱国际歌致哀。云南军区第二速成中学及某步兵学校学习的战斗英雄卫小堂、冯来根、曾宪德等表示：要化悲痛为力量，学好文化，掌握现代化的军事技术，以苏联军队为榜样，为保卫边防、巩固国防、支持抗美援朝斗争的胜利而努力。河南军区的战斗英雄和功臣在七日举行了追悼会。著名的战斗英雄、一等功臣娄清新，刺杀英雄李玉玺在会上致悼词。他们一致表示：努力学习战无不胜的斯大林的军事学说，随时准备给敢于发动侵略战争的帝国主义者以致命的回击。新疆军区政治部和中国共产党新疆军区直属党委会在六日联合发出关于悼念斯大林大元帅逝世的通知，号召全体指挥员、战斗员化悲痛为力量，永远和苏联人民团结一致，继续提高警惕，为世界和平、民主事业奋斗到底。湖北军区全体指挥员、战斗员表示决心努力学习斯大林同志的军事学说，加强国防建设，和苏联人民一道，为巩固世界持久和平而奋斗。
    中国人民解放军战斗英雄和文艺工作者们，纷纷撰文悼念斯大林大元帅。著名的战斗英雄张明以“斯大林同志永远活在我们的心里”为题写道：
    “我还深深记得一九五一年我们中国青年代表团访问苏联时所留下的印象。在列宁格勒和斯大林格勒革命历史陈列馆里，记载着那最艰苦的一九一八年和一九一九年间斯大林同志亲自指挥着劣势装备的苏联军队，打败了装备和数量上占极大优势的反革命军队和外国干涉者。在莫斯科博物馆里，我们看到一幅很动人的油画，那是描写苏联卫国战争中斯大林大元帅为了全世界劳动人民的幸福，为了彻底消灭法西斯强盗而彻夜不眠亲自指挥作战的动人形象。这些给予我一个深刻的印象：斯大林是一面胜利的旗帜。他像一座海洋中的灯塔，照耀着全世界 劳动人民斗争的道路。”张明在悼文最后写道：“这里，我向斯大林同志宣誓：我们一定在毛主席的领导下，坚决学习苏联先进的军事科学，熟练地掌握现代化作战的兵器和联合兵种作战的指挥技术，迅速走向现代化；并坚决永远的和苏联人民一道，为保卫世界和平和共产主义的光辉事业奋斗到底。”
    战斗英雄刘子林以“为斯大林的事业奋斗到底”为题写道：“我要坚决学习斯大林同志的伟大革命精神，作一个共产主义事业和保卫世界和平的坚强战士。”
    曾经在一九五一年途经苏联到柏林参加第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的部队文艺工作者沈西蒙、白文、谷音等在他们的悼文中写道：“最敬爱的领袖和导师斯大林同志永远活在我们的心里，活在我们的事业里。”
