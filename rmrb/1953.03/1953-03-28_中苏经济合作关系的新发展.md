    New Developments in Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation
    In his speech at the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, said: "The Soviet government will continue to cooperate closely with the great Chinese people and the people of all People's Democratic countries politically and economically, and strengthen fraternal friendship and solidarity with them in the future." Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of China, said in his condolence telegram mourning the death of Comrade Stalin: "The Chinese people will, with the greatest firmness, forever unite closely with the great Soviet people, consolidate and strengthen the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union." The governments of China and the Soviet Union are infinitely loyal to the great Stalin's legacy of strengthening friendly cooperation between the two peoples. The recent signing of the protocol on the turnover of goods between China and the Soviet Union in 1953, the protocol based on the "Agreement of February 14, 1950, on a Loan to the People's Republic of China," and the agreement on Soviet assistance to China in expanding existing power stations and building new power stations have provided new proof of this.
    These protocols and agreements stipulate the further expansion of trade between China and the Soviet Union. In 1953, the Soviet Union will supply China with equipment needed for metallurgy, mining, machine manufacturing, chemical industry, electricity and other industrial sectors, as well as materials needed for industry and transportation, new-style agricultural machinery, breeding livestock, seeds, and many other goods. China will supply the Soviet Union with non-ferrous metals, rice, vegetable oil, oilseeds, meat, tobacco leaves, tea, fruits, wool, jute, raw silk, silk fabrics, leather, and other goods.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the trade relations between China and the Soviet Union have been growing continuously and rapidly. The proportion of the total value of trade between China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in China's total foreign trade has increased from 26 percent in 1950 to 72 percent in 1952. The growth of trade relations between China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and the sincere and selfless fraternal assistance from the Soviet Union to China, have greatly helped China's economic recovery and development, enabling China's industrial and agricultural production to recover and exceed pre-war levels in just three years.
    Now, just as China is entering a period of large-scale economic construction, the Soviet Union has signed various protocols with China regarding trade and assistance to China's construction, further expanding trade with China and supplying China with various equipment and materials necessary for economic construction. This once again vividly demonstrates the sincere and selfless economic cooperation and mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union. As Comrade Stalin pointed out in his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "The experience of this cooperation shows that no capitalist country can provide the People's Democracies with real and technically skilled assistance as the Soviet Union can. The point is not only that this assistance is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The main point is that this cooperation is based on mutual assistance and a sincere desire to achieve common economic uplift. As a result, there has been rapid industrial development in these countries."
    The further development of Sino-Soviet economic cooperation undoubtedly further inspires the Chinese people's confidence in achieving victory in large-scale economic construction under the conditions of continuing the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. U.S. imperialism has constantly attempted to obstruct and undermine China's economic recovery and development by various shameless means. Just recently, during the talks between U.S. and British government officials in Washington, the U.S. government coerced the British Conservative government to submit to its aggressive policies and strengthen the "embargo" against China, attempting to stifle China. But even the British bourgeoisie knows that the result of the British government following the U.S. in implementing the "embargo" will only further damage Britain's economic interests and deepen its economic difficulties. It will not have the slightest impact on China's continued and continuous high growth. Because the imperialist countries (including Britain) have been implementing "blockades" and "embargoes" against China for several years, and the facts have proved that they have failed. The main key is that China has established friendly cooperation and mutual assistance relations with the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries in the economic field, and thus formed a new world market that is parallel to and opposed to the capitalist world market. As the great Stalin pointed out: The imperialist countries' policies of "blockade" and "embargo" not only cannot stifle us, but, contrary to their original intention, have promoted the formation and consolidation of the world market of peace and democracy, while the capitalist world market has deepened its economic crisis due to the loss of vast markets and resources.
    The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable and constantly developing. With the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the heroic and hardworking Chinese people will surely achieve great victories on the economic construction front, transforming China from a backward agricultural country into an industrialized country, and greatly strengthening the strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Obviously, the power generated by our friendship is infinite and truly invincible. Let all imperialist aggressors and war mongers tremble before our great friendship!"

### 中苏经济合作关系的新发展

    中苏经济合作关系的新发展
    苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议的发言中说：“苏联政府今后将继续和伟大的中国人民，和各人民民主国家的人民在政治上和经济上密切合作，加强和他们的兄弟友谊与团结。”我国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志在哀悼斯大林同志逝世的唁电中说：“中国人民一定会以最大的坚定性，和伟大的苏联人民永远紧密地团结一致，巩固并加强以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营”。中苏两国政府无限忠实于伟大斯大林加强两国人民友好合作的遗教，由于最近中苏间关于一九五三年度货物周转的议定书、根据“一九五零年二月十四日关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定”的议定书以及苏联帮助中国扩大现有电力站和建设新电力站的协定的签订又得到了新的证明。
    这些议定书和协定规定了中苏间贸易的进一步扩大。苏联在一九五三年内将供给我国以冶金、采掘、机器制造、化工、电力和其他工业部门所需要的设备，以及工业和运输所需要的材料，新式的农业机械、种畜、种子和许多其他货物。我国则以有色金属、大米、植物油、油籽、肉、烟叶、茶叶、水果、羢毛、黄麻、生丝、绸缎、皮革及其他货物供给苏联。
    自中华人民共和国建立以来，我国与苏联的贸易关系即不断地、突飞猛进地增长。我国对苏联的和人民民主国家的贸易总值在我国对外贸易总额中的比重，已经从一九五○年的百分之二十六增加到一九五二年的百分之七十二。中国和苏联及人民民主国家贸易关系的增长，和苏联对我国的真诚无私的兄弟般的援助，大大帮助了我国经济的恢复和发展，使我国的工农业生产在短短的三年中即恢复和超过了战前的水平。
    现在，正当我国进入大规模经济建设的时候，苏联又与我国签订了有关贸易和协助我国进行建设的各项议定书，进一步扩大对我国的贸易，供给我国以进行经济建设所必需的各种设备和材料。这又一次生动地表现了中苏之间的真诚无私的经济合作和互助关系。正如斯大林同志在他的天才的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书中所指出的：“这个合作的经验表明，没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。结果，在这些国家中便有了高速度的工业发展。”
    中苏经济合作关系的进一步发展，无疑地更加鼓舞了我国人民在继续抗美援朝斗争的条件下进行大规模经济建设的胜利信心。美帝国主义曾不断企图以各种无耻手段阻碍和破坏我国经济的恢复和发展。就在最近美国与英国政府官员在华盛顿举行的会谈中，美国政府又胁迫英国保守党政府服从它的侵略政策，对我国加强“禁运”，想以此窒杀我国。但连英国资产阶级也知道：英国政府跟随美国实施“禁运”的结果，除了进一步使英国的经济利益遭受损害而加深它经济上的困难之外，对我国经济的继续不断的高涨是不会发生丝毫的影响的。因为帝国主义国家（包括英国在内）对我国实行“封锁”“禁运”并不是什么新鲜事情，它们早已这样做了几年了，事实证明它们是失败了。这主要的关键就是我国已经与苏联及各人民民主国家建立了经济上的友好合作和互助关系，并由此而形成了与资本主义的世界市场平行的同时也是和它对立的新的世界市场。正如伟大的斯大林所指出：帝国主义国家的“封锁”“禁运”政策不但不能窒杀我们，反而违反他们的本意，促使了和平民主的世界市场的形成和巩固，而资本主义世界市场却因失掉了广大市场和资源而加深了它们的经济危机。
    我国与苏联之间的友谊是牢不可破和不断发展的。英勇勤劳的中国人民在苏联真诚无私的帮助下，必将获得经济建设战线上的伟大胜利，使中国由落后的农业国变为工业化的国家，而大大加强和平民主社会主义阵营的力量。正如毛泽东同志所说：“显然，我们这种友谊所产生的力量是无穷无尽和真正无敌的。让一切帝国主义侵略者和战争贩子们在我们伟大的友谊面前颤抖吧！”
