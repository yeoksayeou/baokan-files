Weak Planning Concepts and Backward Production Management
Many Factories and Mines Failed to Meet Production Plans in January and February

[This Newspaper Reported] This year, in January and February, many factories and mines in various regions failed to fulfill the state's production plans. In the Northeast region, of the 52 major products in January, 23, including steel ingots, pig iron, power generation, and coking coal, did not meet the plan. In February, of the 39 major products, 8 did not meet the plan. In the Southwest region, of the 29 major products in January, 19, including pig iron and steel ingots, did not meet the plan. In February, of the 30 products, 16, including iron ore and steel, did not meet the plan. In the East China region, 18 important products produced by 63 major factories and mines failed to meet the plan in both January and February. A survey of 152 factories in Shenyang City showed that 70 failed to meet the plan in February. In Tianjin City, 38 of the 58 major factories failed to meet the plan in February. In Taiyuan City, 18 of the 27 major factories and mines failed to meet the plan in January, and 16 failed to meet the plan in February.

The main reasons for the poor completion of production plans in January and February were largely the same across regions, mainly due to the weak planning concepts of enterprise leaders and backward production management.

Weak planning concepts are mainly manifested in the following aspects: First, there is insufficient understanding of the significant tasks undertaken by the production departments after the start of large-scale national economic construction. Some feel that the focus of the state's leadership over industry has shifted to capital construction, and the responsibilities of the production departments can be reduced, so it "doesn't matter" if the production plan is not completed. Some leading cadres in factories and mines in the Northeast even thought: "We were exhausted from increasing production and practicing economy last year, and we should take a breather at the beginning of this year!" With such erroneous thinking among leading cadres, they naturally relaxed their education of workers, resulting in very lax labor discipline, which directly affected the completion of the plan. Second, there is a lack of awareness that the masses must be relied upon to complete the plan. The state's plan was not well communicated to the workers, and the masses were not fully mobilized to discuss the plan. Many steel, machinery, and electrical factories in East China treated the formulation of plans as the business of a few leading cadres or planning departments. Not only did they not mobilize the masses to discuss it, but some did not even announce the plan to the masses. Most factories and mines in the Northeast that failed to meet the plan did not effectively mobilize the masses to discuss the plan. The Southwest 102 Steel Plant did not clearly explain the weekly and monthly plans to the workers. Some steelworkers did not know what kind of steel to make until the molten steel had already been loaded into the furnace. Third, there is a lack of the concept of completing the plan in a balanced manner. Many factory and mine leaders in the Northeast who failed to meet the plan felt that it "didn't matter" whether or not the first quarter's plan was completed. They said, "It doesn't matter if the first quarter is not completed, there are still three quarters left!" Some coal miners said, "In our mine, you can't see the cadres at the beginning of the month, but they all come at the end of the month." This phenomenon is extremely common in various regions.

The backward production management in these factories and mines is mainly manifested in: First, many accidents. The Yingcheng Coal Mine in the Northeast had 36 consecutive accidents in January. The sintering blower of the Angang Ore Dressing Plant broke down twice in January, causing more than ten days of work stoppage, which affected iron smelting. The large hydrogen tank in the hardening oil branch of the Shenyang Chemical Plant exploded, seriously hindering production. The distillation tower bottom of the cylinder oil workshop leaked oil, and the hot oil pump was not working properly, so production was stopped, and the February plan was only half completed. The important mechanical equipment of the Tianjin Hengda Flour Mill had been unattended for a long time, and girder fractures occurred in January and February, reducing flour production by more than 70,000 bags. The Taiyuan Paper Mill reduced the production of paper by more than one-third in January and February due to machine shutdowns. This situation is common in various regions. Second, low quality and many defective products. The Northeast Rubber Factory No. 8 stopped production for 20,000 work hours due to the poor quality of its products. Of the six factories in the Shenyang City light industry system that failed to meet the January plan, four failed because of low quality and many defective products. The defective rate of the radiator factory reached 22% in February, so that only 75% of the production task was completed. The Southwest Factory No. 602 had a defective rate of 13% in February. The defective rate of a certain product in Factory No. 614 reached about 90% in January. Similar examples exist in various regions. Third, there is no organized balanced production, and the production process is chaotic and disconnected. Because the parts were not supplied, the Shanghai Qiujiang Machine Factory planned to assemble 23 grinding machines, but only assembled 14. The No. 4 Cotton Spinning Mill in Tianjin wasted more than 175,000 spindle hours in February due to insufficient roving supply in the fine yarn workshop. Because there were not enough punching machines in the second workshop of the Electric Engineering Factory No. 2, silicon steel sheets could not be punched out, but other workshops had surplus punching machines that were not fully utilized. The Taiyuan Factory No. 106 used up its parts reserves at the end of last year to catch up with the task, and 1,800 work hours were lost due to waiting for materials in January.

In addition, untimely supply of raw materials and lax labor discipline are also important reasons for the failure to complete the plan.

### 计划观念不强和生产管理落后  许多厂矿一、二月份未完成生产计划

    计划观念不强和生产管理落后
    许多厂矿一、二月份未完成生产计划
    【本报讯】今年一、二月份，各地有很多厂矿没有完成国家的生产计划。东北区一月份五十二种主要产品中，有钢锭、生铁、发电量和焦煤等二十三种没有完成计划；二月份三十九种主要产品中，有八种没有完成计划。西南区一月份二十九种主要产品中，没有完成计划的有生铁、钢锭等十九种；二月份三十种产品中，没有完成计划的有铁矿砂、钢材等十六种。华东区六十三个主要厂矿生产的十八种重要产品，一、二月份都没有完成计划。沈阳市调查了一百五十二个工厂，二月份没有完成计划的有七十个。天津市五十八个主要工厂，二月份没有完成计划的有三十八个。太原市二十七个主要厂矿，一月份有十八个未完成计划，二月份有十六个未完成计划。
    一、二月份生产计划完成得很不好，其原因各地大致相同，主要是企业的领导干部计划观念不强和生产管理落后。
    计划观念不强，主要表现在以下几方面：一、对国家大规模经济建设开始以后生产部门担负的重大任务认识不足，觉得国家对工业的领导重心转到了基本建设方面，生产部门的责任可以减轻了，因此，生产计划完不成也“不要紧”。东北有些厂矿的领导干部还认为：“去年搞增产节约累得够呛，今年年初该松一口气！”领导干部有这种错误的思想，自然就放松了对工人的教育，因而劳动纪律很松弛，直接影响了计划的完成。二、缺乏必须依靠群众来完成计划的观念，没有很好地向职工传达国家的计划，没有充分发动群众讨论计划。华东许多钢铁、机械和电器厂把编制计划当作是少数领导干部或计划部门的事，不但没有发动群众讨论，有的甚至没有向群众宣布计划。东北大多数没有完成计划的厂矿，都没有很好地发动群众讨论计划。西南一○二钢铁厂没有把每周每月的计划向工人交代清楚，有的炼钢工人到钢水已经装进了炉子还不知道炼那种钢。三、缺乏均衡地完成计划的观念。东北许多没有完成计划的厂矿负责人就认为完不完成第一季度计划是“无所谓”的。他们说：“第一季完不成不要紧，还有三个季度哩！”有些煤矿的工人说：“在我们矿里，月初看不见干部，月末干部都来了。”这种现象在各个地区极为普遍。
    这些厂矿生产管理落后的情况，主要表现在：一、事故多。东北营城煤矿一月份连续发生三十六次事故。鞍钢选矿厂烧结鼓风机一月份中发生两次故障，停工十多天，影响了炼铁。沈阳化工厂硬化油分厂大型氢气罐爆炸，严重地妨碍了生产；汽缸油车间的蒸溜塔底漏了油，热油泵不好用，停止生产，二月份计划只完成了一半。天津恒大面粉厂的重要机件设备长期无人负责，一、二月份都发生了大梁折断事故，减产了面粉七万多袋。太原造纸厂因为机器停车，一、二月份少生产了三分之一以上的纸。这种情况各地普遍存在。二、质量低、废品多。东北橡胶八厂因产品质量低劣，停止生产两万工时。沈阳市轻工业系统一月份没有完成计划的六个工厂，有四个工厂是因为质量低、废品多。暖气片厂二月份废品率达百分之二十二，使得生产任务只完成了百分之七十五。西南六○二厂二月份废品达百分之十三。六一四厂一月份某种产品的废品率竟达百分之九十左右。类似的例子在各地区都有。三、没有组织均衡生产，生产过程混乱脱节。上海虬江机器厂因为零件供应不上，计划装配二十三部磨床，只装出了十四部。天津棉纺四厂细纱车间因落纱供应不足，二月份浪费了十七万五千多锭时。电工二厂第二车间因为冲床不够用，矽钢片冲不出来，但是其他车间却有多余的冲床没有充分利用。太原一○六厂去年年底赶任务，把零件储备量用完了，一月份停工待料一千八百工时。
    此外，原材料供应不及时和劳动纪律松弛，也是使计划完不成的重要原因。
