Conscientiously Overcome Bureaucratic Work Style and Do a Good Job in Coal Mine Safety

Production in the coal mine system is a constantly shifting underground operation. Workers must constantly and tirelessly fight against natural disasters such as water, fire, gas, and roof collapses. Any slackening will lead to serious accidents. A major accident not only causes serious harm and destruction to the lives and safety of workers and the state's equipment and resources, but also seriously affects the workers' morale and prevents production from proceeding normally for a considerable period. This directly affects the completion of the national plan. Countless facts prove that anyone who neglects safety and leads production with a purely task-oriented view will not be able to complete the task. This year is the first year of large-scale economic construction in the country, and coal mines across the country must comprehensively complete their production tasks to meet the needs of national construction. Therefore, the implementation of the safety production policy must attract greater attention from coal mine workers, especially leaders at all levels. In 1952, although the state continued to increase various safety equipment, safety work showed a regressive trend. Compared with 1951, deaths increased by 13 percent, minor and major injuries increased by 51.3 percent, and the number of various accidents increased by 49.4 percent. A serious analysis of the reasons for the rise in these accidents and drawing lessons from them will greatly promote this year's safety work.

What are the reasons for the increase in accidents in the coal mine system last year?

First, many leading cadres in coal mines do not have a comprehensive understanding of safe production, and therefore, when production and safety conflict, they relax safety work. Many accidents in various mines occur at the end of January, the end of a quarter, and the end of the year when production tasks are rushed, which is a good illustration. Because at this time, cadres only think about how to complete the task, and safety issues are often forgotten. Little do they know that failure to pay attention to safety and the occurrence of accidents will only cause serious losses to the country and prevent the production task from being completed well. For example, the gas explosion accident at the Xi'an Mining Bureau made it impossible to complete the production task last year. It should be pointed out that this kind of fluke mentality of only focusing on rushing production and hoping to avoid accidents is a bureaucratic work style that is irresponsible to the lives of workers and the state's resources, and it means forgetting that one is a leader of a socialist enterprise. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the policy of unifying safety and production at all times. The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau implemented the policy of safe production from beginning to end throughout the year last year, not only basically eliminating fatal accidents, but also achieving very good results in the Three-Anti Campaign, and the entire bureau comprehensively overfulfilled the task of increasing production and practicing economy, and gloriously won the title of model mine for safe production. The experience of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau should attract the attention of all mining bureaus.

Second, the harm of bureaucratic work style prevents many leading cadres from adapting to the development of objective situations and continuously studying their work to improve management levels, which is also an important reason for the increase in accidents last year. Over the past three years, thanks to the state's large investments, the continuous efforts of all employees, and the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, the face of the coal mining industry has undergone fundamental changes. By the end of 1952, the old plundering-style coal mining methods that destroyed national resources and disregarded the lives of workers had gradually been eliminated, and the working faces using new coal mining methods accounted for 86.96 percent of the total coal mining working faces; mechanized production had gradually replaced heavy manual labor, and the output of mechanized coal mining working faces accounted for 73.24 percent of the total output in 1952. These changes were originally the most basic guarantee for eliminating accidents and implementing safe production. However, after implementing new coal mining methods and mechanized coal mining, it is necessary to further improve operation methods, labor organization, roof management, underground transportation, fire prevention, gas prevention, and a series of other tasks to adapt to the needs of the new situation. Many coal mine management cadres and engineering technicians do not have a sufficient understanding of this huge change and still use the old methods to lead production. As a result, accidents occur frequently, and work is stuck in a passive state for a long time. In 1952, roof collapse and side wall collapse accidents and transportation accidents accounted for 87 percent of the total number of accidents. Coal mine management cadres and engineering technicians must face up to this problem.

Another new situation in the coal mining industry is that a large number of grassroots cadres have been promoted from among the workers. These cadres have a high enthusiasm for work and are relatively closely connected with the masses, but they lack leadership experience in production and have a low level of technical theory. However, many leading cadres do not pay attention to the training and education of these cadres, but simply use them and simply ask them to complete the "task." These cadres are familiar with the old methods, and they can only use the old methods to lead production. Because they have not seriously studied various regulations and systems, they naturally cannot implement them well, and even resist regulations and systems based on old experience. These grassroots cadres are the people who directly command production at the working face. Their single-minded pursuit of output regardless of regulations and systems is a great threat to safety issues. Last year, there were incidents in which grassroots cadres directed workers to steal coal from old pits (dangerous mined-out areas) in order to complete the task, or watched workers violate safety regulations and did not intervene. Last year, the Safety Inspection Team of the Central Fuel Industry Department conducted examinations on safety regulations for 434 grassroots cadres, and the result was that 70 percent of the cadres failed. This situation should arouse the serious attention of various mining bureaus. If leading cadres still treat these issues with a bureaucratic attitude, no matter how they shout safety first in words, it will not help matters.

Finally, it should also be pointed out that because of the efforts of all employees in the coal mine system, safety work had achieved great results in 1951. As a result, some people unconsciously developed a certain degree of complacency and complacency, and the establishment and improvement of safety institutions, the implementation of regulations and systems, and safety education were all done poorly, so that safety institutions were powerless in name only, and phenomena that disregarded safety regulations and destroyed the system were common and serious.

Judging from the above accident analysis, these bloody lessons are profound. The safety production meeting convened by the Coal Mine Management Bureau this time has made many necessary provisions for strengthening and improving safety work. Party organizations, administrations, and trade unions in coal mines across the country should criticize the erroneous understanding and bureaucratic work style of safety work and work together to do this work well. Party organizations must educate all party members to lead the masses to conscientiously implement these decisions; trade unions should conscientiously and regularly conduct safety education for the workers, vigorously promote the experience of Shi Yuhai and Liu Jiuxue safety groups, so as to ensure the implementation of safety regulations, and strive to reverse the regressive situation of coal mine safety work.

### 认真克服官僚主义作风，做好煤矿安全工作

    认真克服官僚主义作风，做好煤矿安全工作
    煤矿系统的生产是不断移动的地下作业。职工们必需时刻不懈地同水、火、瓦斯、顶板塌落等自然灾害进行斗争，稍有松懈，就会发生严重事故。一次重大事故，不但使职工生命安全和国家的设备资源遭受到严重的伤害和破坏，而且严重影响职工的生产情绪，在相当时期内，使生产不能正常进行。这就直接影响国家计划的完成。无数事实证明：谁要是忽视安全，用单纯任务观点去领导生产，谁就不可能完成任务。今年是国家开始大规模经济建设的第一年，全国的煤矿必须全面地完成生产任务以满足国家建设的需要。因此安全生产方针的贯彻，必须引起煤矿工作者特别是各级领导干部的更大注意。在一九五二年中，虽然国家曾经继续增加了各种安全设备，但是，安全工作却呈现倒退现象。一九五二年和一九五一年相比，死亡增加百分之十三，轻重工伤增加百分之五十一点三，各种事故次数增加百分之四十九点四。认真地分析这些事故上升的原因，从中吸取经验教训，对于今年的安全工作将有很大的推动作用。
    去年煤矿系统事故所以上升的原因何在？
    首先，许多煤矿的领导干部对安全生产的认识还不全面，因而，当生产与安全发生矛盾时，就放松了安全工作。各矿井很多事故都发生在一月之末、一季之末、一年之末的突击生产任务的时候，就是很好的说明。因为这个时候干部们一心只想如何完成任务，安全问题常常就忘在脑后了。殊不知不注意安全，发生了事故，结果只有使国家遭受严重的损失，使生产任务不能很好完成。例如西安矿务局的瓦斯爆炸事故，就使得去年完不成生产任务。应该指出，这种只顾突击生产，希望侥幸不出事故的侥幸心理表现出来就是对职工生命对国家资财的不负责任的官僚主义作风，就是忘记了自己是社会主义企业的领导者。因此，必须时时刻刻贯彻安全与生产统一的方针。焦作矿务局去年全年自始至终贯彻了安全生产的方针，不但基本上消灭了死亡事故，同时三反运动的效果很好，全局全面地超额完成了增产节约任务，光荣地获得安全生产模范矿的称号。焦作矿务局的经验应该引起各个矿务局的重视。
    其次，由于官僚主义作风的危害，许多领导干部不能适应客观形势的发展，不断钻研业务提高管理水平，这也是去年事故增多的重要原因。三年来，由于国家的大量投资、全体职工的不断努力和苏联专家的无私帮助，煤矿工业生产的面貌已经有了根本的改变。到一九五二年末，那种破坏国家资源不顾工人生命安全的掠夺式的旧采煤法已逐渐被淘汰，采用新采煤法的工作面已占总采煤工作面的百分之八十六点九六；机械化的生产也逐渐代替了笨重的体力劳动，一九五二年机械化采煤的工作面的产量已占总产量的百分之七十三点二四。这些改变，对于消灭事故实行安全生产本来是最基本的保证。但是，实行新采煤法和机械化采煤以后，必须进一步改进操作方法、劳动组织、顶板管理、井下运搬、防火、防瓦斯等一系列工作，才能适应新形势的需要。许多煤矿管理干部和工程技术人员对于这一巨大的变化却认识不足，仍是用老一套的办法来领导生产。结果事故频繁，工作长期陷于被动。一九五二年，冒顶片帮事故和运搬事故占全部事故次数的百分之八十七。煤矿的管理干部和工程技术人员必须正视这个问题。
    煤矿工业中的另一个新情况是，从工人中提拔了大批的基层干部。这些干部工作热情高，和群众的联系比较密切，但是，在生产方面却缺乏领导经验，技术理论水平不高，而许多领导干部不注意对这些干部的培养教育，只是单纯使用，单纯要他们完成
    “任务”。这些干部熟悉的是旧的一套，也就只能用旧的一套领导生产，对于各种规程制度因为没有认真学习，自然无法很好地贯彻执行，甚至从老的经验出发抵抗规程制度。这些基层干部是在工作面上直接指挥生产的人，他们不顾规程制度地单纯追求产量，对于安全问题是一个很大的威胁。去年曾经发生基层干部指挥工人去老塘（有危险的采过煤的地区）偷煤以便完成任务，或者是看着工人违犯保安规程而不过问的事情。去年中央燃料工业部安全检查团对四百三十四名基层干部作了保安规程的考试，结果是百分之七十的干部不及格。这一情况应该引起各个矿务局的严重注意。如果领导干部仍然用官僚主义的态度对待这些问题，不管口头上怎样喊叫安全第一，于事都是无所补益的。
    最后，还应该指出，因为煤矿系统全体职工的努力，一九五一年安全工作已经得到很大成绩，于是，有些人不自觉地产生了一定程度的松懈自满情绪，对于建立和健全保安机构，对于贯彻规程制度和安全教育等工作都做得很差，以致保安机构有职无权徒具形式，不顾保安规程和破坏制度的现象是普遍而严重的。
    从以上事故分析来看这些血的教训是深刻的。此次煤矿管理总局召开的安全生产会议对于加强与改进安全工作作了许多必要的规定。全国煤矿中的党组织、行政和工会都应该批判对于安全工作的错误认识和官僚主义作风，共同努力做好这一工作。党组织必须教育全体党员带动群众认真贯彻这些决定；工会应该认真地经常地对工人群众进行安全教育，大力推行施玉海、刘九学安全小组的经验，以保证保安规程的贯彻执行，为扭转煤矿安全工作的倒退状况而斗争。
