    Wuhan Municipal People's Government Abolishes Residents' Night Watch and Striking Clocks System
    Letter from the General Office of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government: In the January 14th issue, reader Wang Bin criticized our city's practice of having children participate in winter fire prevention night patrols in some street residents' organizations. This criticism is correct. Our city's residents' night watch work was spontaneously organized by citizens in 1951; initially, night watches were conducted around major festivals, but later gradually became a regular winter fire prevention effort. After this work was rolled out throughout the city, it achieved great success, but formalism, coercion, and other shortcomings also occurred in some areas. Currently, with the strengthening of our city's fire protection equipment and social security work, and the increased vigilance of the residents, the night watch work is no longer necessary. On January 14th, the Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an order deciding to strengthen the night patrol work of public security personnel and abolish the residents' night watch and striking clocks system.

    武汉市人民政府已取消居民守夜打更制度
    武汉市人民政府办公厅来信：一月十四日报上，读者王彬来信对我市某些街道居民组织让儿童担当冬防夜巡工作的问题提出批评。这个批评是对的。我市居民守夜工作是在一九五一年由市民自动组织起来的；起先在重大节日前后守夜，后来逐渐成为经常性的冬防工作。这项工作在全市展开后，成绩很大，但某些地方也发生了形式主义、强迫命令等缺点。目前我市消防设备和社会治安工作加强，居民群众警惕性提高，守夜工作已无继续必要。一月十四日市公安局已公布命令，决定加强公安人员的巡夜工作，取消居民守夜打更制度。
