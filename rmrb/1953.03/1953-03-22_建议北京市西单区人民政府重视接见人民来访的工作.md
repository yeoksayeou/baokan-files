    Suggestion that the Xidan District People's Government of Beijing Municipality attach importance to the work of receiving people's visits.
    A letter from Ji Xiaode and Jiang Qi: suggests that the Xidan District People's Government of Beijing Municipality attach importance to the work of receiving people's visits. At 11:00 a.m. on February 22, we went to the Xidan District People's Government to handle the matter of transferring our children to another school (we are new cadres who came to work in Beijing from other provinces, and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Education Bureau told us to go there). When we arrived at the reception room, a young comrade said, "We are not open on Sundays!" We asked:
    "Could we speak with the comrade on duty?" The young comrade said, "The person on duty is only responsible for answering the phone, not for handling business!" We said, "According to our understanding, the person on duty is supposed to handle matters on Sundays." The young comrade immediately adopted a bad attitude and said, "We are an organ led by the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and we have these 'rules'!" Later, we learned that the young comrade was the communications clerk in charge of reception, and after we talked with him for a while, he finally admitted his mistake. However, in the end, we were still not allowed to see the comrade on duty. Receiving the people is an important task to strengthen the connection between the government and the people, especially at the district level of the People's Government. But the situation of the Xidan District People's Government is not satisfactory. We thought: if someone goes to report a counter-revolutionary incident or other major event, and the person on duty "only answers the phone and does not handle business," wouldn't that cause incalculable losses? Also, we are all working cadres, and we can only handle our own affairs on Sundays when we are not on duty (some of us work in Beijing Xiyuan); if it's not possible at this time, how can we handle it? Please, Xidan District People's Government of Beijing Municipality, examine the above situation, consider our opinions, and we hope for a reply in the newspaper.

### 建议北京市西单区人民政府重视接见人民来访的工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    建议北京市西单区人民政府重视接见人民来访的工作
    吉效德、江圻来信：建议北京市西单区人民政府重视接见人民来访的工作。二月二十二日上午十一时，我们去西单区人民政府办理儿童转学的事情（我们是新从外省来北京工作的干部，北京市人民政府教育局告诉我们去的）。我们到了该处传达室，一个青年同志说：“星期日不办公！”我们问：
    “请值班同志谈一下可以吗？”青年同志说：“值班人只管接电话，不办公！”我们就说：“据我们了解，星期日值班人要处理事情的。”青年同志马上发态度说：“我们是北京市人民政府领导的机关，我们就这‘规则’！”后来我们知道那青年同志是负责传达的通信员，我们和他谈了一阵，他总算承认错误了。但结果，仍然不许我们见值班同志。接待人民群众，是加强政府和人民群众联系的重要工作，尤其区一级的人民政府。但西单区人民政府的情况却不能令人满意。我们想：如果有人去检举反革命事件或其他重大事件，值班人也“只管接电话，不办公”，是不是会造成不可估计的损失？又，我们都是在职干部，我们只能在星期日，在我们不值班时（我们中有的在北京西苑办公），来办自己的事；这时间不行，我们如何办呢？请北京市西单区人民政府检查上述情况，考虑我们的意见，并望在报上答复我们。
