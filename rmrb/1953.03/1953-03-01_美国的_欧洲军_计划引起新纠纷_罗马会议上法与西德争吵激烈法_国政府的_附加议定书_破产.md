Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch:

    The French government, in order to facilitate the passage of the "European Army" plan in parliament, proposed a so-called "Additional Protocol" to the "European Defense Community" agreement. The foreign ministers of France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg recently met in Rome to discuss this "Additional Protocol." The proposal of the "Additional Protocol" and the reactions from various parties, as well as the situation at the Rome conference, illustrate that the crisis of the US "European Army" plan has not been eliminated by Dulles' recent trip to Europe, but has instead increased new disputes.

    The French government proposed the "Additional Protocol" because the "European Defense Community" agreement, which betrays the French nation, has been widely opposed by all sectors of society, including even some right-wing bourgeois elements. This situation made parliamentary approval impossible.

    The content of the "Additional Protocol" has so far been kept secret, but it is revealed that France demanded in the "Additional Protocol" to retain partial control over the French army and arms production in order to maintain its rule over French overseas colonies. The "Additional Protocol" also stipulates the "relationship" between Britain and the "Defense Community," to support France in countering West German influence within the group.

    The Mayer government hoped to use such an "Additional Protocol" to confuse public opinion and at the same time quell the attacks from many quarters within the bourgeoisie. However, the proposal of the "Additional Protocol" did not achieve the results expected by the Mayer government. Not only do the French people fundamentally oppose the "European Defense Community" agreement, but even within the bourgeoisie, disputes are becoming increasingly acute. Led by Pierre André, a member of the Independent Republican Party, about a hundred members of parliament from right-wing parties issued a joint declaration demanding the "defense of French unity," and they acknowledged that the "European Army" agreement is incompatible with the constitution. Senior officers in the French army issued documents criticizing the content of the "European Army" agreement. Even de Gaulle issued a statement acknowledging that the so-called "European Army" "is politically a cover for abandoning national sovereignty, and militarily is to provide troops for the strategic plans of the United States."

    Although Bidault had indicated that the "Additional Protocol" was only "interpretive and supplementary in nature," it still caused much dissatisfaction in other relevant countries. The West German ruling group especially clamored fiercely. Bonn's Chancellor and Foreign Minister Adenauer said that the French proposal in its current form was absolutely unacceptable. The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" said that the "European Army" plan had reached "the darkest stage in its history." Other participating countries in the "European Army" plan also expressed disinterest. United Press International reported that a French official spokesman admitted on the 18th that these countries were "lukewarm." As for Britain, its official British Information Service specifically broadcast a commentary from the "Daily Telegraph," telling France not to harbor the "illusion" of dragging Britain into the water.

    The foreign ministers of the six countries of the "European Defense Community" held a meeting in Rome on the 24th and 25th. Prior to the meeting, the interim committee of this group also held two days of secret preparatory meetings in Paris. According to United Press International, the West German representatives attending the Paris meeting complained that the French "Additional Protocol" would make it more difficult for the "European Army" agreement to pass in the West German parliament, while the French believed that West Germany was deliberately making things difficult for France. Reuters quoted French commentators as saying: "The views of France and Germany have never been so difficult to reconcile."

    According to the Associated Press, France and West Germany continued to fiercely argue over the issue of control over the "European Army" at the Rome conference. France insisted that it had the right to withdraw French troops from the "European Army," but still maintain its full voting rights in the "European Army" organization; West Germany said: the size of voting rights should depend on the number of troops provided by each country, and if West Germany provides more divisions than France, it should get additional voting rights. In the end, French Foreign Minister Bidault announced a retreat and "revised" the conditions proposed by France. The foreign ministers of the six countries then reached an "agreement" and instructed the interim committee of the "European Defense Community" to rewrite the "Additional Protocol." The Mayer government's so-called "Additional Protocol" trick thus completely failed.

    Most of the bourgeois newspapers in France believe that the Rome conference was fruitless. "Paris Presse" commented on the 26th: "The meeting avoided a breakdown, but the problem was not solved at all." "Le Monde" pointed out that the ratification of the "European Army" agreement is encountering "increasingly greater opposition" in France, and it said gloomily: "The predetermined goal seems difficult to achieve."

    美国的“欧洲军”计划引起新纠纷
    罗马会议上法与西德争吵激烈  法国政府的“附加议定书”破产
    【新华社二十七日讯】法国政府为了便利在议会通过“欧洲军”计划，曾对“欧洲防务集团”协定提出一件所谓“附加议定书”。法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡六国外长最近在罗马开会，讨论了这个“附加议定书”。“附加议定书”的提出以及各方面的反应和罗马会议的情形说明：美国的“欧洲军”计划的危机并没有因杜勒斯最近欧洲之行而消除，而是增加了新的纠纷。
    法国政府提出“附加议定书”，是因为出卖法国民族的“欧洲防务集团”协定在国内遭到广泛阶层的反对，甚至包括一部分右翼的资产阶级分子。这种情形，使得议会的批准成为不可能。
    “附加议定书”的内容迄今保守秘密，但据透露，法国在“附加议定书”里要求：保留对法国军队和军火生产的部分控制权，以维持对法国海外殖民地的统治。“附加议定书”还规定英国和“防务集团”的“联系”，为法国在集团内对抗西德势力撑腰。
    迈耶政府希望用这样一个“附加议定书”来迷惑一下舆论，同时平息一下资产阶级内部许多方面的抨击。但是，“附加议定书”的提出并没有收到迈耶政府所预期的效果。不仅法国人民根本反对“欧洲防务集团”协定，就在资产阶级内部，争吵也是日益尖锐。以独立共和党议员皮埃尔·安德烈为首，百来个右翼政党的国会议员发表了一个联合宣言，要求“保卫法国统一”，他们承认“欧洲军”协定是和宪法相抵触的。法国军队中的高级军官发表文件，批驳“欧洲军”协定的内容。连戴高乐也发表声明，承认所谓“欧洲军”“在政治上是掩饰放弃国家主权，在军事上是为了要某些国家为美国的战略计划提供军队”。
    虽然皮杜尔曾经表明，“附加议定书”只是“解释与补充性质”的，但它在其他有关国家仍然引起了许多不满。西德统治集团特别叫嚷得凶。波恩总理兼外交部长阿登纳说，法国的建议在目前形式下绝不能接受。“法兰克福环球报”说，“欧洲军”计划到了它“历史上最黑暗的阶段”。“欧洲军”计划的其他参与国也表示不感兴趣。合众社消息说，法国官方发言人在十八日承认，这些国家“态度冷淡”。至于英国，它的官方的英国新闻处特地发播了“每日电讯报”的一篇评论，叫法国不要存着把英国也拉下水的“幻想”。
     “欧洲防务集团”六国外交部长于二十四日和二十五日在罗马举行会议。会前，这个集团的临时委员会还在巴黎举行了两天的秘密预备会议。据合众社透露，出席巴黎会议的西德代表埋怨法国的“附加议定书”会使得“欧洲军”协定在西德议会更难通过，而法国人却认为西德故意与法国为难。路透社引法国评论家们的意见说：“法、德双方的意见从来没有像这样难于协调。”
    据美联社透露，在罗马会议上，法国和西德继续在“欧洲军”的控制权问题上激烈争执。法国坚持它有权从“欧洲军”中抽调法军，可是还要保持它在“欧洲军”机构里的全部表决权；西德说：表决权的大小应取决于各国提供军队的多寡，如果西德提供的师团比法国多，它就应该得到额外的表决权。最后，法国外交部长皮杜尔宣告退却，“修正”了法国提出的条件。六国外交部长于是达成
    “协议”，责成“欧洲防务集团”临时委员会重新起草“附加议定书”。迈耶政府的所谓“附加议定书”的把戏因此彻底破产。
    法国的大多数资产阶级报纸都认为罗马会议并无结果。“巴黎新闻”二十六日评论说：“会议是避免了破裂，但是问题丝毫没有解决。”“世界报”指出批准“欧洲军”协定的事情在法国正遇到“愈来愈大的反对”，它阴沉地说：“预定的目标似乎难于达到。”
