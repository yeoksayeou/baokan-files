Tieshan Township in the Fifth District of Liuyang County is a typical experimental township of the Hunan Provincial Marriage Law Implementation Committee. The township has a total population of 1,082 people (569 males and 513 females). Before the promulgation of the Marriage Law, arranged and bought marriages, early marriage, and the adoption of child brides were very common in the township. After the Marriage Law was promulgated, it was publicized once, but it was not in-depth. Cadres and the masses had extremely vague and one-sided understandings of the Marriage Law, believing that seeing each other once before getting married counted as free marriage. Arranged and bought marriages were still very popular. Many emancipated peasants could not afford to marry a wife, or were in debt because of marriage. Child brides were no longer adopted after liberation, but farmers could not understand the prohibition of early marriage. Some married without registering with the district government, and some falsely reported their age to obtain marriage certificates. Inequality between men and women and abuse of women were still common. Two cases of killing women through abuse occurred in 1951 and 1952.

When the work team arrived in Tieshan Township, the township was busy issuing land certificates and building water conservancy projects, and cadres and the masses were very concerned about these two things. The work team promptly convened meetings of township and team cadres, explained their intentions, and explained the policies for implementing the Marriage Law. Starting from the things that the masses were currently concerned about, they put forward the slogan of "Building water conservancy and implementing the Marriage Law at the same time." Based on the opinions of the township cadres, it was decided to issue land certificates and build water conservancy projects during the day, and study the Marriage Law at night. This solved the problem of combining work and created favorable conditions for smoothly carrying out the propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law.

After the township cadre meeting, in order to understand the situation and learn from experience, the work team selected two teams as the focus, equipped them with strength, and went deep into the masses; at the same time, they organized cadres to study the Marriage Law in groups. On the other hand, they mobilized and organized various forces to carry out propaganda, convened propaganda worker meetings, changed the township's original "Water Conservancy Construction Propaganda Team" to the "Water Conservancy Construction and Marriage Law Implementation Propaganda Team," and used blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, slogans, etc. for general propaganda. Rural theater troupes also staged plays to promote the Marriage Law. Teachers from people's schools and winter schools were also organized to explain the Marriage Law during class time.

After general propaganda and understanding the situation, it was found that the common concerns among cadres and the masses were fear of struggles between families, fear of breaking up couples and families, and fear of causing wives to divorce. For example, middle peasant Li Zhongwen said: "Now you have to keep a close eye on your wife, if you let go, she will become someone else's." Bad guys deliberately provoked, and Jiang Shaozheng, who often acted as a matchmaker, said: "Today there will be meetings for mothers-in-law, tomorrow there will be meetings for daughters-in-law, the work team has grasped the materials, and the day after tomorrow there will be struggle sessions." When others called middle peasant Liu Xiulian to study the Marriage Law, he said: "It's really nonsense, it will cause divorces everywhere." Those who supported the Marriage Law were bachelors and young people, and there were not many of them; they were willing to report the situation to the work team, but mainly talked about their problems finding a partner.

After the work team understood and grasped these main ideological concerns of the masses, it was decided to publicize the Marriage Law, starting with Article 8 of Chapter III, "Husbands and wives have the obligation to love, respect, help, support each other, live in harmony and unity, engage in labor and production, and raise children, and strive together for family happiness and the construction of a new society." They repeatedly explained the positive purpose of implementing the Marriage Law, which was to improve the relationship between husband and wife, improve family relations, gradually abolish the feudal marriage system, establish a new family of equality between men and women, harmony and mutual assistance, and labor production, and lay the foundation for further construction of a new society. The work team also clearly realized that it was necessary to mobilize all men and women, young and old, especially to pay attention to mobilizing the elderly and married men; at the same time, it was also necessary to mobilize young people to lay a broad foundation for the implementation of the Marriage Law; to find and cultivate models and expand influence. After this was determined, it was implemented in cadre study and various meetings and work.

When village cadres first began to study the Marriage Law, their understanding was similar to that of the masses: they had many concerns about publicizing the Marriage Law, they were not enthusiastic about studying, they were afraid to reveal their ideological situation, and those who had abused their wives and had messy relationships were afraid of being punished. Therefore, some did not come to participate in the study, and some were afraid to publicize after learning, and did not dare to tell their wives. Zeng Xianju, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, even forbade his wife to come out to attend meetings and study. However, after studying and discussing the specific problems of the township, such as family discord, disordered relationships between men and women, and abuse of women, and guiding them to recognize that the feudal marriage system was the main source of these problems, they gradually eliminated misunderstandings and concerns, and realized the benefits of the Marriage Law. The ideological knots of the cadres were untied, the study gradually became more energetic, and more people participated in the study. For example, women's representative He Zhaohui said: "The Marriage Law is so good, not only should cadres study it, but the masses should also study it." The next day, she found some young people to participate in the study. On the first night, 26 cadres and 19 members of the masses participated in the study. On the third night, the number of cadres increased to 33, and the number of the masses increased to 45.

The method of organizing study was to convene various mass meetings in each group, and carry out propaganda and explanation targeting the different ideological concerns and various misunderstandings of different objects. For example, for mothers-in-law, it was proposed that in order to make the family harmonious, it was necessary to establish a new atmosphere of respecting mothers-in-law and loving daughters-in-law. The mothers-in-law were very happy to hear this. When talking about the prohibition of child brides, they started from the suffering of child brides, causing the mothers-in-law to recall the torture they suffered when they were child brides in the past. When talking about equality between men and women, they talked about how women did not have property rights, and people who wanted to give a little gift had to wrap it in footcloth and secretly take it out, fearing that their husbands would not agree, which also hit the mothers-in-law's hearts. After the mothers-in-law figured it out, they talked about the benefits of the Marriage Law everywhere. Some mothers-in-law even urged their daughters-in-law to attend meetings to study the Marriage Law, and helped their daughters-in-law cook and take care of their children. Middle peasant Zeng Dongchu had been separated from his mother-in-law for two years due to discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. This time, after the mother-in-law returned home happily after the meeting, she said to her daughter-in-law: "The Marriage Law is really good. I realized the things that were wrong in the past. Tomorrow you should also go to the meeting and listen, and I will cook and take care of the children for you." Later, after the daughter-in-law returned home from the meeting, her attitude towards her mother-in-law also changed, and the whole family was harmonious. Another example is that middle peasant Li Chenggen found a child bride for his son and had always abused her. He did not dare to participate in the study. Later, he and his wife reluctantly participated in the study. After the meeting, they understood the truth. The two discussed and said: "We have both made mistakes, arranged a marriage for our son, and treated our daughter-in-law badly. Now we will do this: The daughter-in-law will go back to her mother's house. If she does not come back, then so be it. If she comes back, she will be treated like our own daughter. When they grow up, if they are willing, they will get married. If they are not willing, they can find their own partners." The mother-in-law of Liu Shaocheng's family said to the work team: "The Marriage Law is so good, please come to my house and tell them all about it." The mothers-in-law publicized the Marriage Law everywhere, so that some of the masses who were not in favor of the Marriage Law also understood the benefits of the Marriage Law. When the daughters-in-law attended the meeting, the focus was on discussing democracy and harmony, respecting mothers-in-law and loving daughters-in-law, and caring for children. For young people, the emphasis was on being cautious about free marriage and not messing around. All of this was accepted by the masses.

In this stage, based on policies combined with facts, and through meeting discussions and individual chats, a wave of study was formed among the masses of the township. Some groups that did not have cadres and activists to preside over the study came to the work team cadres to publicize the Marriage Law. After the broad masses understood the basic spirit of the Marriage Law, some incorrect understandings could be corrected by the masses in a timely manner.

### 湖南省浏阳县铁山乡根据群众思想情况宣传婚姻法

    湖南省浏阳县铁山乡根据群众思想情况宣传婚姻法
    浏阳县第五区铁山乡是湖南省贯彻婚姻法运动委员会的典型试验乡。全乡共有人口一千零八十二人
    （男五百六十九人、女五百一十三人）。婚姻法颁布前，该乡包办和买卖婚姻，早婚和收童养媳的现象非常普遍。婚姻法颁布以后，宣传过一次，但很不深入，干部和群众对婚姻法的认识极其模糊和片面，认为男女双方见过一次面再结婚就算是自由结婚。包办和买卖婚姻仍很流行。很多翻身农民娶不起老婆，或者因结婚而欠下一身债。童养媳在解放后就没有收养的了，但农民对禁止早婚想不通，有的不到区政府登记就结婚，有的虚报年龄骗取结婚证。男女不平等、妇女受虐待还是普遍现象，一九五一年和一九五二年曾发生两件虐杀妇女的案件。
    工作组到铁山乡时，该乡正忙于发土地证和兴修水利，干部和群众对这两件事都很关心。工作组及时召开了乡、组干部会，说明来意，交代贯彻婚姻法的政策，并从群众当前关心的事出发，提出“兴修水利和贯彻婚姻法两不误”的口号，又根据乡干部的意见，确定白天发土地证和修水利，晚上学习婚姻法。这样便解决了工作上的结合问题，为顺利开展宣传贯彻婚姻法运动创造了有利条件。
    乡干部会以后，工作组为了摸清情况，吸取经验，选择了两个组为重点，配备了力量，深入群众；同时组织干部分片进行婚姻法的学习。另一方面，动员与组织各种力量进行宣传，召开了宣传员会议，将该乡原有的“兴修水利宣传队”改为“兴修水利和贯彻婚姻法宣传队”，又利用黑板报、大字报、标语等进行一般的宣传，还由农村剧团排演了宣传婚姻法的戏。也组织了民校和冬学的教员在上课时间讲解婚姻法。
    经过一般的宣传和了解情况，发现干部和群众中普遍存在的顾虑，是怕家庭之间搞斗争，怕拆散夫妇、拆散家庭，怕引起妻子闹离婚。如中农李中文说：“如今老婆要抓紧点，松手就会变成别人的。”坏家伙则故意挑拨，经常做媒的江绍正说：“今天开婆婆会，明天开媳妇会，工作组掌握了材料，后天就开斗争会。”中农刘秀莲当别人喊他去学习婚姻法时，他说：“真是乱弹琴，搞得这里那里都会闹离婚。”拥护婚姻法的是单身汉和青年人，人数不多；他们愿意找工作组反映情况，但主要还是谈他们找对象的问题。
    工作组了解与抓住了群众的这些主要的思想顾虑后，确定宣传婚姻法首先从第三章第八条“夫妻有互爱互敬、互相帮助、互相扶养、和睦团结、劳动生产、抚育子女，为家庭幸福和新社会建设而共同奋斗的义务”入手，反复说明贯彻婚姻法的积极目的，是搞好夫妻关系，搞好家庭关系，逐渐废除封建的婚姻制度，建立男女平等、和睦互助、劳动生产的新家庭，为进一步建设新社会打下基础。工作组同时明确认识到：必须男女老少全面发动，尤其是要注意发动老年人、成年有妻子的男子等；同时也要发动青壮年，为贯彻婚姻法运动打下一个广阔的基础；物色与培养模范，扩大影响。这样确定以后，便在干部学习和各项会议与工作中贯彻下去。
    乡村干部在开始学习婚姻法时，认识也和群众差不多：对于宣传婚姻法有着许多顾虑，学习不起劲，不敢暴露思想情况，过去虐待老婆和乱搞过男女关系的怕受处分。因此，有的不来参加学习，有的学了回去不敢宣传，不敢对老婆讲。青年团支部书记曾宪菊甚至不准老婆出来开会和学习。但经过学习并讨论了该乡的具体问题，如家庭不和、男女关系紊乱、虐杀虐待妇女等，并引导他们认识封建婚姻制度是产生这些问题的主要根源之后，他们便逐渐消除了误解和顾虑，认识到婚姻法的好处。干部思想疙瘩解开了，学习慢慢有劲了，参加学习的人也多起来。如妇女代表何昭辉说：“婚姻法该多好，不光是干部要学习，群众也都要学习。”第二天她就找来一些青年参加学习。第一天晚上全乡参加学习的干部二十六人，群众十九人，第三天晚上，干部增加到三十三人，群众增加到四十五人。
    组织学习的方法，是由各片组召开各种群众性的会议，针对不同对象的不同思想顾虑和各种误解，进行宣传解释。如对婆婆，提出要使家庭和睦，必须树立尊婆爱媳的新气象。婆婆们听了很高兴。讲到禁止童养媳时，就从童养媳的痛苦谈起，引起婆婆们回忆过去自己做童养媳时所受的折磨。讲到男女平等时，就讲妇女没有财产权，想送一点点礼物的人情，都要用裹脚布包起来偷偷拿出去，怕丈夫知道不依，这也正打在婆婆的心坎上。婆婆们想通了，会后她们到处讲婚姻法的好处。有的婆婆还催媳妇去开会学习婚姻法，自己帮媳妇煮饭带孩子。中农曾冬初因婆媳不和分家已经两年，这次婆婆在开会后，高高兴兴地回到家里对媳妇说：“婚姻法真好，我认识了过去那些不对的地方，明天你也去开会听一听，我替你煮饭、带小孩。”后来媳妇开会回家后，对婆婆的态度也变好了，全家和睦了。又如中农李成根替儿子讨了个童养媳，一贯虐待，不敢参加学习，后来和老婆勉强参加了学习，会后懂得了道理，两人商量说：“我们两个都犯了错误，替儿子包办了婚姻，又待媳妇不好。如今这样办：媳妇回娘家去了，不回来就算了，回来后要作亲女看待；长大时他们两人如果心愿就结婚，不心愿听他们自己去找对象。”刘绍成家的婆婆对工作组说：“婚姻法这样好，请你们到我家里去对他们都讲一下。”婆婆们到处宣传婚姻法，使原先很不赞成婚姻法的一部分群众，也都懂得了婚姻法的好处。在媳妇开会时，着重讨论了民主和睦、尊婆爱媳、爱护子女的问题。对青壮年着重讲自由结婚要慎重，不要乱来。这样都为群众乐意接受了。
    在这一阶段中，根据政策结合事实，通过会议讨论，个别漫谈，形成了全乡群众的学习热潮。有些没有干部和积极分子去主持学习的小组，纷纷来找工作组干部去宣传婚姻法。广大群众领会了婚姻法的基本精神后，一些不正确的认识，也能为群众及时纠正。
