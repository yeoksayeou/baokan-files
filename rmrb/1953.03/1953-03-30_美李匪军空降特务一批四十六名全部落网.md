Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 29th. A group of forty-six armed special agents parachuted into South Hamgyong Province by the American aggressors were completely wiped out by the local army and people within a few days. According to the Korean Central News Agency: In February of this year, the U.S. Far East Command's 8240th unit dispatched forty-six armed special agents, who were flown in two twin-engine aircraft. They were dropped in batches in the counties of Tanchon, Sinpo, Kwangchon, and Iwon in South Hamgyong Province. They disguised themselves despicably as Korean People's Army soldiers, carrying a 60mm rocket launcher, as well as machine guns, rifles, pistols, landmines, and other explosives, attempting to sabotage important factories, railways, bridges, military highways, and military supply warehouses in North Korea, and to assassinate important cadres. However, thanks to the high vigilance and alert, decisive actions of the Korean people, self-defense forces, public security personnel, and the Korean People's Army, the vast majority of these parachuted special agents were quickly captured, and the rest were forced to surrender or give themselves up. All forty-six special agents were caught without a single one escaping.

    美李匪军空降特务一批四十六名全部落网
    【新华社平壤二十九日电】美国侵略者不久以前在咸镜南道一次空降的武装特务四十六人，在几天之内就被当地军民一网打尽。据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：今年二月间，美军远东司令部八二四零部队派遣了四十六名武装特务，分坐两架双引擎飞机，在咸镜南道退潮、新浦、广泉、利原等郡分批降落。他们卑鄙地化装成朝鲜人民军，携带着一门六十公厘的火箭炮以及机关枪、步枪、短枪、地雷和其他爆炸物，企图破坏朝鲜北部的重要工厂、铁道、桥梁、军用公路和军需仓库，并企图暗杀重要干部。但是，由于朝鲜人民、自卫队、公安人员和朝鲜人民军的高度警惕与机警果敢的行动，这批空降特务，绝大多数很快地都被捕获，其余的也被迫自首或投降。全体四十六个特务没有一个漏网。
