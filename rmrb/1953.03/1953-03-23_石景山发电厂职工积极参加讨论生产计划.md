Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: Workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant are actively participating in discussions and the formulation of the 1953 production plan. Currently, a surge of "finding the key" is sweeping through the entire plant. According to statistics from the turbine, boiler, and electrical workshops, workers have proposed 1,560 rationalization proposals for improving operational methods and rationally adjusting labor organization, laying a good foundation for formulating average advanced quotas and production plans.

The ability of all plant workers to actively participate in the discussion of the production plan is primarily due to the factory leadership's focus on ideological education. Before discussing the production plan, the General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the Shijingshan Power Plant conducted a relatively in-depth investigation of ideological conditions. Simultaneously, in conjunction with the plant's production tasks, it organized cadres from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League at the workshop level and above to study relevant documents, held training classes for production group leaders and activists, and organized the masses to listen to reports and hold discussions. Through this education, general cadres and the masses established the concept of comprehensively fulfilling the state plan and criticized the shortcomings of the past year, where a one-sided focus on cost planning led to the failure to complete the three targets of coal consumption, plant electricity consumption, and power generation. Workers expressed dissatisfaction with the original 1953 production plan compiled by the administration, considering it backward and conservative. In this regard, everyone exposed many facts, such as the fact that the number of man-hours and materials stipulated in the plan for this year's major repairs were copied from last year's plan, even including rework. For example, some administrative units deliberately buried potential in the plan in order to win awards. The electrical workshop only needed fifty man-hours to repair the third coal conveyor, but planned eighty man-hours; only eighty kilograms of angle iron were needed to repair the coal conveyor, but five hundred and twenty kilograms were planned. After inspection, the masses of workers requested a re-discussion and formulation of this year's production plan based on average advanced quotas.

During the discussion of the production plan, in order to make the workers clear about the direction of tapping potential, the factory leadership specifically raised the key problems of each workshop. The solution of these key problems is extremely important for achieving the four major indicators of increasing power generation, reducing costs, reducing coal consumption, and saving plant electricity consumption. Take the boiler workshop as an example: if the combustibles in the flue gas can be reduced from 17.7 percent to 5 percent, it can save the country 536 tons of coal a year; if the flue gas outlet temperature is reduced by another 20 degrees, it can save the country another 2,592 tons of coal a year. Raising key issues is the most effective way to encourage and organize the masses of workers to find the key.

Giving play to the enthusiasm of veteran workers and technicians is of decisive significance for formulating advanced production plans. For example, veteran worker Lin Duange rarely participated in various activities in the past. After mobilization this time, he actively participated in the compilation of the production plan. He and other workers in his group successively put forward more than 80 rationalization proposals. For example, after technical worker An Wanquan recognized the importance of discussing the plan, he actively sought ways to solve the problem of air leakage from the safety door and voluntarily drew two drawings to be submitted to the technical research association for research.

### 石景山发电厂职工积极参加讨论生产计划

    石景山发电厂职工积极参加讨论生产计划
    【新华社二十一日讯】石景山发电厂职工积极参加讨论和制定一九五三年生产计划。目前全厂职工已掀起找窍门的热潮，据汽机、锅炉、电气等三个车间的统计，职工们所提出改进操作方法、合理调整劳动组织等合理化建议就有一千五百六十件，为制定平均先进定额和生产计划奠定了良好的基础。
    全厂职工能够积极地参加讨论生产计划，首先是由于工厂领导方面抓紧了思想教育工作。在讨论生产计划之前，中共石景山发电厂总支委员会曾进行一次比较深入的思想情况调查，同时结合本厂的生产任务，组织车间以上的党、行政、工会和青年团的干部进行有关文件的学习，举办了生产小组长和积极分子训练班，并且组织群众听报告和开讨论会。通过这些教育，一般干部和群众都树立了全面完成国家计划的观念，批判了去年由于片面注意成本计划，以致不能完成煤耗、厂用电和发电量等三个指标的缺点。职工们对行政方面原来编制的一九五三年生产计划表示不满，认为是落后和保守的。在这方面大家揭发了许多事实，例如计划中规定今年大修的工数和料数，都是按照去年的计划抄下来的，甚至连返工活也计算在内。例如有些行政单位为了得奖，编制计划的时候故意打埋伏。电气车间修理第三运煤器只需要五十个工，却计划了八十个工，修理运煤器的三角铁只需八十公斤，却计划了五百二十公斤。经过检查，职工群众要求在平均先进定额的基础上重新讨论和制定今年的生产计划。
    在讨论生产计划时，工厂领导方面为了使职工明确挖潜力的方向，特地提出各个车间的关键问题。这些关键问题的解决，对于达到增加发电量、降低成本、减少煤耗和节约厂用电四大指标关系极大。就拿锅炉车间来说，如能把烟气中的可燃物从百分之十七点七减低到百分之五，一年就可以替国家节省五百三十六吨煤，如果烟气出口温度再降低二十度，一年又可以替国家节省二千五百九十二吨煤。提出关键问题，是鼓舞和组织职工群众找窍门最有效的方法。
    发挥老工人和技术人员的积极性，对于制定先进的生产计划有决定的意义。例如老工人林端各，以往很少参加各种活动，这次经过动员后，积极地参加了生产计划的编制工作，他和组里其他工友先后共提出八十几件合理化建议。例如技术工人安万泉认识了讨论计划的重要性后，就积极地寻求解决安全门漏气的办法，自动画了两张图交给技术研究会去研究。
