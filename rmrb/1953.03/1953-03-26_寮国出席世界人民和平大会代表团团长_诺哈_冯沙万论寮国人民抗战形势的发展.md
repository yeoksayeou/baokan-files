Xinhua News Agency, 25th: The Vietnamese "People" weekly recently published an article by Noha Phongsavan, head of the Lao delegation to the World People's Peace Congress, entitled "Laos' Situation Last Year."

The article states: In the past year, the situation in Laos has undergone many changes. Lao guerrillas and militiamen, working closely with the Lao People's Liberation Army, have removed many French military strongholds in Luang Prabang Province, such as Ba Lao, Meng Xin, Bei Fei, and in Sam Neua Province, Meng Fen. These victories, along with the victories of the Vietnamese People's Army, especially the Peace Campaign, have greatly struck at the French colonialists.

Faced with this situation, the French colonialists and American interventionists have tried every means to undermine the Lao resistance. They constantly organized puppet regimes, oppressing and exploiting the people in the occupied areas. They sent spies to the liberated areas to gather intelligence and spread rumors. They frequently launched "sweeps" against Meng Shan, Sam Tai in Sam Neua Province, and Meng Guang and Bu La Fei in central Laos, burning villages and leaving fields barren.

The article points out: The enemy's brutality cannot suppress the Lao people's love for independence and peace. On the contrary, the Lao people hate them even more and are more determined to carry out the resistance. Guerrilla warfare is developing day by day. The guerrillas and militiamen have strengthened their organization. The Lao Free National United Front has become more consolidated. The prestige of the Lao Resistance Government has increased in the occupied areas. The people in the liberated areas are actively engaged in production. Even in the areas most severely ravaged by the French army's "sweeps," the people voluntarily support the army and cadres.

In March 1952, the Central Executive Committee of the Lao Free National United Front launched a campaign to promote the alliance of the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Lao peoples (formerly translated as the United National United Front of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos), strengthening the solidarity of the Lao people with the people of these two friendly countries, especially with the Vietnamese people.

In September 1952, for the first time in their history of resistance, the Lao people sent representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and the World People's Peace Congress. At these two gatherings, delegations of peace-loving people from all over the world sympathized with and supported the Lao resistance.

The article concludes: The achievements at home and abroad have greatly encouraged the Lao people, making them more energetic in carrying out the resistance. Facing the American conspiracy to expand the war of aggression in Asia, the Lao people, relying on the strength of the alliance of the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Lao peoples and the sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world, will certainly overcome difficulties, eliminate the French and American aggressors and traitors, achieve independence, unity, and prosperity, and contribute their strength to defending peace in Asia and the world.

### 寮国出席世界人民和平大会代表团团长  诺哈·冯沙万论寮国人民抗战形势的发展

    诺哈·冯沙万论寮国人民抗战形势的发展
    【新华社二十五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南“人民”周刊最近刊载寮国出席世界人民和平大会代表团团长诺哈·冯沙万的文章，题为“寮国去年的形势”。
    文章说：在过去的一年，寮国的形势有了许多变化。寮国游击队和民兵紧密地配合寮国人民解放军作战，拔除了琅勃剌邦省的巴老、孟新、北费和桑怒省的孟芬等许多法军据点。这些胜利和越南人民军的胜利尤其是和平战役的胜利一起，大大地打击了法国殖民者。
    面对着这个情况，法国殖民者和美国干涉者想尽方法来破坏寮国的抗战。他们不断组织傀儡政权，压迫和剥削侵占区中的人民。他们派遣间谍到解放区刺探情报和散布谣言。他们经常向桑怒省的孟山、桑泰和寮国中部的孟光、布拉菲等地发动“扫荡”，烧毁村庄和使田地荒芜。
    文章指出：敌人的残暴不能压制寮国人民对独立与和平的热爱，相反地，寮国人民更加仇恨他们，更坚决地进行抗战。游击战一天天地发展。游击队和民兵在组织上加强了。寮国自由民族统一战线更加巩固了。寮国抗战政府在被侵占的地区中的威信增加了。解放区人民积极生产。甚至在遭受法军“扫荡”蹂躏最厉害的地区，人民还是自愿地支援军队和干部。
    一九五二年三月，寮国自由民族统一战线中央执行委员会发动了一个宣传越南—高棉—寮国人民联盟（前译越南、高棉、寮国三国联合民族统一战线）的运动，加强了寮国人民和这两个友好国家的人民尤其是和越南人民的团结。
    一九五二年九月，寮国人民在他们的抗战历史上第一次派代表出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和世界人民和平大会。在这两个集会上，世界各国爱好和平的人民代表团都同情并支持寮国的抗战。
    文章最后说：国内外的成就大大地鼓舞了寮国人民，使他们更有力地去进行抗战。面对着美国阴谋扩大亚洲侵略战争，寮国人民依靠越南—高棉—寮国三国人民联盟的力量和全世界爱好和平人民的同情，一定将克服困难，肃清法美侵略者和卖国贼，达到独立、统一与繁荣，并对保卫亚洲和世界和平贡献自己的力量。
