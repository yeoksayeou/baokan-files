    France's "Gospel" and "Misfortune" in Vietnam
    Cui Qi
    Because Dulles rebuked France for its "lack of initiative" in the war of aggression against Vietnam, and for "not establishing a strong indigenous army in Indochina as the United States did in South Korea," France's "number one soldier," Challe, recently made a "trip" to the Far East. He inspected the French forces invading Vietnam, met with Clark, the head of the US invading forces in the Far East, in Tokyo, and together with Clark, "observed" the situation of the US training of the Li Chengwan puppet army in South Korea. According to the Associated Press, when Challe visited the South Korean military training base in Gwangju, he "praised the impartial methods used in basic infantry training" and believed that "this is an appropriate combination of the scientific teaching methods of the United States and the practical teaching methods of Japan." Does Challe really admire the training results of the Li puppet army from the bottom of his heart and willingly worship Li Chengwan as a teacher? Marshal Challe, who once served under Petain, Hitler's number one puppet, and has been persecuting the people of North Africa and Vietnam for many years, is he not more "experienced" than Li Chengwan? However, the situation is pressing. In order to show that he is loyally implementing the Eisenhower-advocated despicable plan of "using Asians to fight Asians," Challe has to pretend to be wholeheartedly convinced. But US officials spoke rudely, saying that their "remarkable achievements" in establishing the South Korean army "can undoubtedly be learned by France." Learn what? In fact, Challe cannot learn anything from the military drill ground in Gwangju near 35 degrees north latitude; if he could "travel" north a little, near 38 degrees north latitude, for example, in places like Shangganling and Dingzi Mountain, he would truly learn some useful lessons. But Clark, fearing a leak, did not even let Challe go to 37 degrees north latitude and took him back to Tokyo by special plane.

    Clark's purpose in taking Challe to South Korea was not entirely to let him learn the "training methods" of the Li Chengwan puppet army. The Americans hoped that after Challe visited those Li puppet troops who were equipped with all kinds of American weapons and were "spirited" because they had not yet gone into battle, he would remember the pitiful appearance of "his soldiers" in Vietnam... Although the French invading forces in Vietnam have been temporarily spared complete destruction only due to US aid, the US aid to Vietnam is not as much as France hoped for. Clark took Challe to South Korea for a visit precisely to give him another American lesson and let him review an American precept: the most humble and the most docile will receive more American aid. Look at Li Chengwan!

    But Challe also has his own plans. Although he had already implemented the poisonous plan of "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese" in Vietnam, the effect was not great. Challe knew that the situation in South Korea was not so wonderful either, but pretending to be obedient and going to South Korea might win more US aid; if the Bao Dai puppet army could be expanded, on the one hand, "less white blood" could be shed, and on the other hand, it might be possible to transfer some of the French invading forces in Vietnam back to Western Europe to improve France's position in the "European Army." On the 24th of last month, the French invading authorities in Vietnam and Bao Dai held a "High-Level Military Committee" meeting, which decided to establish forty-five battalions of "Vietnamese Militia." The meeting communique stated that the Bao Dai government "will conscript soldiers from many levels of citizens." The Bao Dai press-ganging personnel, carrying weapons and ropes, will break into the doors of every family in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam, and the people in the French-occupied areas are facing even greater disasters. This is the "harvest" of Challe's trip to South Korea.

    Unexpectedly for the French ruling class, at this time they heard a series of harsh shouts from the United States: "The responsibility for the Indochina War has begun to become an international responsibility." "France will be urged to explicitly promise to give Indochina independence within a certain period of time." "Eisenhower very much hopes that France will allow Vietnam to finally achieve complete independence." "Due to the internationalization of the Indochina War, American economic assistance has become completely legitimate, and it is precisely because of this that the concept of the French Federation can be clarified by submitting this issue to international review." "The internationalization of the Indochina War will be the gospel of Indochina and France." These "gospels" made the French ruling class nervous, as if they had had a nightmare. They saw on the back of the two American signboards of "internationalization" and "independence" were written: France get out of Vietnam immediately, and the United States will replace it. The United States hinted to his French "friends": I can help you invade Vietnam and preserve your Vietnamese colony, but you must give Vietnam to me.

    When the American "Life Magazine" insulted France as a "prostitute," the French parliament as a "place to sleep," and government ministers as "clowns," although the French ruling class was indignant, it was only a loss of face, but not a loss of profit. Now that the Americans are reaching out to seize France's colonial money bag, the French ruling class is much more anxious and heartbroken than being scolded for their ancestors. The French "Combat" wrote with tears in its eyes: "The United States' decision to give priority to sending arms to Vietnam and training Vietnamese troops seems to be the most unfortunate internationalization for France." "Control of the Indochina War seems to be transferring from Paris to Washington... Is this what the French government has been hoping for for nine years?" "Gospel" belongs to the United States, and "misfortune" belongs to France. The so-called "concept" of the French Federation has finally been "clarified."

    In order to force France to accept his "gospel," Clark, the commander of the US Far East Command, disregarding his "status," is now going to "visit" Saigon. He will urge France to step up the expansion of the Bao Dai puppet army in accordance with the US plan and conspire to plot the so-called "Far East Anti-Communist United Front." Clark's trip to Vietnam will only deepen the contradictions between the United States and France in Vietnam. The British "Manchester Guardian" revealed one point: "Bao Dai demands to obtain American supplies directly, and France seems unwilling to give in on this issue. For this reason, Clark's visit will not be conducted in a completely uncontroversial atmosphere." Le Tourneau, the French High Commissioner in Vietnam, further stated that "direct talks between Vietnam and the United States will not solve any problems." "Will not solve any problems" - this is the conclusion of the warmongers and colonialists who travel around in a hurry. They cannot realize the plan of "using Asians to fight Asians" as they wish, nor can they solve their infighting. No matter whose "gospel" among them, it will eventually turn into "misfortune." The heroic Vietnamese people will finally and thoroughly drive out the French aggressors and American interventionists from the fertile land of the Red River and the Mekong River.

    法国在越南的“福音”和“不幸”
    崔奇
    由于杜勒斯斥责了法国对侵越战争“缺乏主动性”，“没有像美国在南朝鲜所做的一样，在印度支那建立一支强大的土著军队”，于是法国的“第一号军人”许温最近到远东作了一次“旅行”。他在越南检阅了侵越法军，在东京会见了美国驻远东侵略军头子克拉克，并和克拉克一起到南朝鲜“观摩”了美国训练李承晚伪军的情况。据合众社称，许温在参观光州的南朝鲜军训练基地时，“对于在基本步兵训练方面所采用的不偏不倚的方法赞叹不止”，他认为“这是美国的科学的教学方法和日本的实际的教学方法的恰到好处的结合”。许温当真是从内心的深处赞美李伪军的训练成绩、而甘心向李承晚拜老师吗？当年曾在希特勒的头号傀儡贝当手下效过劳、多年来以迫害北非人民和越南人民为职业的许温元帅，难道不比李承晚更有“经验”吗？然而时势迫人，许温为了表示他要忠心执行艾森豪威尔所倡导的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的卑鄙计划，不得不装出五体投地的样子。但美国官员却出口不逊地说，他们建立南朝鲜军队的“显著成就”，“不成问题可以供法国好好学习”。学习什么呢？事实上，许温仅仅在北纬三十五度附近的光州的军事演习场上，是学不到什么东西的；假使他能向北“旅行”一下，在北纬三十八度附近，比如在上甘岭和丁字山这些地方，他就会真正地学到一些有益的教训了。可是克拉克害怕漏了底，连北纬三十七度也没有让许温去，就用专机把他带回东京了。
    克拉克把许温带到南朝鲜去的目的，还不完全是让他学习李承晚伪军的“训练方法”。美国人希望许温参观了那些装备着各种各样美国武器的、由于还没有上阵而“神气十足”的李伪军之后，就会想起越南那些“他的士兵”的可怜相……。虽然侵越法军只是由于美国的援助才暂免于全部毁灭，但是美国对越南的援助总不如法国所希望的那样多。克拉克把许温带到南朝鲜去参观，正是为了给他再上一堂美国课，让他再温习温习一个美国训条：最卑下和最驯服者将得到更多的美援。请看李承晚！
    但是许温也有许温的算盘。“用越南人打越南人”的毒计，他虽然早已在越南实行过了，效果却是不大的。许温知道美国在南朝鲜的情况也不是那么美妙，但是装做俯首贴耳一些到南朝鲜去跑一遭，也许可以博取较多的美援；如果能够把保大伪军加以扩充，一方面可以“少流白种人的血”，一方面还可能抽调一部分侵越法军回到西欧去，以提高法国在“欧洲军”中的地位。上月二十四日，法国侵越当局和保大举行了“高级军事委员会”会议，决定要建立四十五营“越南民军”。会议公报说：保大政府“将在许多阶层的公民中征兵”。带着凶器和绳索的保大抓丁人员，将闯进越南法占区的每一个家庭的房门，法占区人民正面对着更大的灾难。这就是许温南朝鲜之行的“收获”。
    出乎法国统治阶级意料的，正在这个时候却听到了一阵阵的来自美国的刺耳的叫嚷：“印度支那战争的责任已开始成为一个国际的责任”。“法国将受到敦促，要它明确地答应在一定时间范围内，给印度支那以独立”。“艾森豪威尔很希望法国允许越南最后完全独立”。“由于印度支那战争的国际化，美国的经济援助成了完全正当的，并且也正由于这样，这个问题能够提交国际审查而使法兰西联邦的观念明朗化”。“印度支那战争的国际化将是印度支那和法国的福音”。这些“福音”使法国统治阶级的神情紧张起来，他们仿佛做了一场噩梦。他们看到在“国际化”和“独立”这两块美国招牌的背面，写着的是：法国立即从越南滚蛋，由美国来代替。美国向他的法国“朋友”暗示说：我可以帮助你侵略越南，保住你的越南殖民地，但是你必须把越南让给我。
    当美国“生活杂志”辱骂法国是“妓女”、法国国会是“睡觉的地方”、政府部长都是“小丑”时，法国统治阶级虽然愤懑不平，但那终归只是丧失了面子，却没有丧失利润。如今是美国佬伸手要夺取法国的殖民地钱袋了，法国统治阶级比被人家骂了祖宗还焦急得多，心痛得多。法国的“战斗报”声泪俱下地写道：“美国决定优先向越南输送军火并训练越南军队等事，对法国来说，似乎是最不幸的国际化”。“印度支那战争的控制权似乎将从巴黎转到华盛顿……难道这就是法国政府九年来的企望吗？”“福音”是属于美国的，“不幸”是属于法国的。所谓法兰西联邦的“观念”终于“明朗化”了。
    美国为了强迫法国接受他的“福音”，美国远东军司令克拉克不顾自己的“身份”，现在正要去“访问”西贡。他将督促法国依照美国的计划加紧扩充保大伪军，并阴谋策划所谓“远东反共联合战线”。克拉克的越南之行，只会加深美法在越南的矛盾。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”透露了其中的一点：“保大要求直接取得美国的供应品，法国似乎不愿意在这个问题上让步。为了这个理由，克拉克的访问将不是在一个完全没有争执的气氛中进行”。法国驻越南高级专员勒都尔诺更声明说：“越南与美国直接会谈不会解决什么问题”。“不会解决什么问题”——这就是战争贩子和殖民主义者们风尘仆仆到处奔波的结语。他们不可能随心所欲地实现“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划，也不可能解决他们之间的勾心斗角。他们之中不论是谁的“福音”，最后都将变为“不幸”。英雄的越南人民将把法国侵略者和美国干涉者，从红河和湄公河的沃土上最后地彻底驱逐出去。
