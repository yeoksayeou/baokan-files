Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 30th: The confessions of a group of American-Chiang Kai-shek spies recently captured by our army further expose the bloody crimes of the American aggressors in forcibly detaining captured personnel from the Chinese and Korean sides.

Wei Shixi, an American-Chiang Kai-shek spy who successively served as the head of the 72nd Regiment, administrator of the 70th Regiment, and military instructor of the 86th Regiment and Jeju Island 2nd Regiment in the American prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, confessed that in early March 1952, the American military police headquarters on Geoje Island held a meeting. Participants included Cai Peipei, head of the 70th Regiment, Wang Shunqing and Li Daan, the commander and deputy commander of the 72nd Regiment, Wang Zunming and Cheng Liren, the commander and deputy commander of the 86th Regiment, and other American-Chiang Kai-shek spies from other regiments. An American Major General from Tokyo gave the “work” assignments, ordering the American-Chiang Kai-shek spies in each regiment to use all means to deceive and intimidate our captured personnel, spreading rumors such as “returning to the mainland will surely lead to being killed,” etc., and to subject our POWs who were determined to return to their motherland to beatings and killings. Cao Jingguo, a security guard of the 6th Battalion of the 72nd Regiment and an American-Chiang Kai-shek spy, confessed that in the 3rd Company of the 6th Battalion alone, fifteen of our captured personnel were beaten so severely that they could not move and were barely breathing. One of our captured personnel named Lin Xuepu was brutally murdered with a knife by Li Daan, the deputy commander of the 72nd Regiment, for expressing his desire to return to his motherland. Before his death, Lin Xuepu shouted: "Long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!" Sun Zhonggeng, an American-Chiang Kai-shek spy who served as the director of academic affairs at the "CIE" school of the 72nd Regiment, confessed his own crimes, saying that he and other American-Chiang Kai-shek spies beat to death Yang Wenhua, one of our captured personnel from the 4th Battalion who was determined to return to his motherland, with clubs. According to Wang Ping, an American-Chiang Kai-shek spy who served as the head of the security team of the 72nd Regiment, on the night before the so-called "screening," the American-Chiang Kai-shek spies cut more than a hundred strips of meat from the bodies of our captured personnel who wanted to return to their motherland, strung them together, and showed them to the various battalions. American-Chiang Kai-shek spy Cao Jingguo personally saw Li Daan holding a string of human meat, threatening everywhere, saying: "I, Li, even ate human meat today!"

The next day, when the so-called "screening" was officially conducted, many of our captured personnel still bravely expressed their desire to return to their motherland. Many people also sang the national anthem – "The March of the Volunteers" – with fervor. At this time, an American sergeant used a wooden stick to knock down one of our captured personnel named Wu Fan; he died in a short while. Then, the American executioners sent armored vehicles and a company of armed military police to drive our captured personnel onto vehicles and take them to an unknown location.

After the illegal "screening" by the American aggressors was met with heroic opposition from our captured personnel, American spy "Pastor Wu," cloaked in religious garb, was ordered to broadcast to our captured personnel, saying: "You are no longer considered prisoners of war, and now you will be moved to Jeju Island as refugees." In April 1952, in order to intensify their reign of terror over our captured personnel, the American aggressors moved the 72nd and 86th Regiments of Geoje Island to Jeju Island and reorganized them into the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments. The enemy built more than a dozen bunkers around each regiment, and a large bunker was built in the center, with machine guns mounted on it. Each "battalion" was surrounded by five or six layers of barbed wire, more than a person's height. Here, the American aggressors continued to use the "CIE" school to carry out reactionary education that slandered the new China, and incidents of torture, interrogation, and massacre continued to occur. The lives of our captured personnel were even worse than before, with two or three hundred people in each regiment often sick, but they continued to fight bravely against the enemy. According to Wei Shixi, in July of last year, the captured personnel of the 2nd Regiment of Jeju Island, where he was located, went on a collective hunger strike because they were not getting enough to eat, forcing the American prisoner-of-war camp authorities to increase the food rations.

According to American-Chiang Kai-shek spy Wang Ping, in June of last year, photographers from the US Information Service went to Jeju Island to film newsreels. They drove the emaciated and ragged captured personnel out of their tents and used more than two hundred strong and healthy American-Chiang Kai-shek spies to dress up as our captured personnel, wearing neat clothes, making actions such as dancing, singing, playing cards, and reading books, and filmed them to deceive the American people and the people of the world. But no matter how painstakingly the American executioners try, they cannot cover up their crimes in the prisoner-of-war camps, and they can never escape the responsibilities they should bear.

### 最近被我捕获的美蒋特务的供词  进一步揭露美国侵略者在战俘营中的罪行

    最近被我捕获的美蒋特务的供词
    进一步揭露美国侵略者在战俘营中的罪行
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】在最近期间被我军捕获的一批美蒋特务所供出的供词，进一步揭露了美国侵略者强迫扣留中朝方面被俘人员的血腥罪行。
    曾历任美方巨济岛战俘营七十二联队联队长、七十联队管理员、八十六联队及济州岛第二联队军事教官的美蒋特务魏世喜供称：一九五二年三月初，巨济岛美军宪兵司令部开了一个会，参加的人有七十联队联队长蔡培培、七十二联队的正副联队长王顺清和李大安、八十六联队的正副联队长王遵铭、程立人及其他联队的美蒋特务，由一个从东京来的美国少将布置了“工作”，命令各联队的美蒋特务用一切手段欺骗和恫吓我方被俘人员，造谣说“回到大陆一定要被杀死”等等，对坚决要回祖国的我方战俘则施行毒打和虐杀。七十二联队六大队警备队员、美蒋特务曹经国供认，仅六大队三中队就有十五位我方被俘人员被打得动弹不得、气息奄奄。有一位名叫林学普的我方被俘人员因表示要回祖国，被七十二联队副联队长李大安用刀子活活割死。林学普临死时还高呼：“共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！”曾任七十二联队“CIE”学校教务主任的美蒋特务孙忠鲠供认他自己的罪行说，他和其他美蒋特务曾把第四大队的一位坚决要回祖国的我方被俘人员杨文华用棍子打死。据曾任七十二联队警备队长的美蒋特务王平供称，在进行所谓“甄别”的前一天晚上，美蒋特务们从要回祖国的我方被俘人员身上割下一百多条肉，穿成一串，拿到各大队传看。美蒋特务曹经国就亲眼看到李大安拿着一串人肉，到处威胁说：“我姓李的今天还吃了人肉哩！”
    第二天正式进行所谓“甄别”时，我方许多被俘人员仍然英勇地表示要回祖国。许多人并激昂地唱起国歌——“义勇军进行曲”来。这时，一个美军中士就用木棒将一位名叫吴范的我方被俘人员拦腰打倒；一会儿他就断了气。接着，美国刽子手们派来了装甲车和一个连的武装宪兵，把我方被俘人员们赶上汽车不知载到什么地方去了。
    美国侵略者的非法“甄别”遭到我方被俘人员英勇反对以后，据美蒋特务孙忠鲠供称，披着宗教外衣的美国特务“乌牧师”奉命向我方被俘人员们广播说：“你们现在已经不算战俘了，现在要把你们以难民身份搬到济州岛去。”一九五二年四月，美国侵略者为了对我方被俘人员加紧进行恐怖统治，便将巨济岛第七十二联队和第八十六联队搬到济州岛，改编为第一、第二、第三联队。敌人在每个联队四周都构筑了十多个碉堡，中央还筑有一个大碉堡，上面架着机枪。每个“大队”外面围着五六层一人多高的铁丝网。在这里，美国侵略者继续利用“CIE”学校对我方被俘人员进行诬蔑新中国的反动教育，拷打、刑讯、屠杀的事件仍继续不断地发生。我方被俘人员的生活比以前更加恶劣，每个联队经常有两三百人生病，但他们仍继续和敌人进行着英勇的斗争。据魏世喜供称，去年七月间，他所在的济州岛第二联队的我方被俘人员因吃不饱饭而集体绝食，迫使美国战俘营当局不得不增加一部分口粮。
    据美蒋特务王平供称，去年六月间美国新闻处的摄影人员曾到济州岛去拍摄新闻影片。他们把骨瘦如柴、衣衫褴褛的我方被俘人员赶出帐篷，用二百多个身体健壮的美蒋特务装扮成我方战俘，穿着整齐的衣服，做出跳舞、唱歌、打牌、看书等动作，摄成影片，用来欺骗美国人民和全世界人民。但美国刽子手们无论如何煞费苦心，也掩盖不了他们在战俘营中的罪行，并决不能逃避他们应负的罪责。
