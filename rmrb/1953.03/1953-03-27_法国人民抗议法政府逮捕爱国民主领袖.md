Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: According to TASS, Paris, March 25th: The French government authorities' arrest of democratic leaders on the 24th and the search of trade union offices have aroused national anger and protest.

    Workers in many enterprises in the Paris region, Marseille, Nice, Nantes, Brest, and other cities have held meetings and announced short strikes. In some cities, the working people sent delegations to the National Assembly to demand the immediate release of the arrested patriots. The Standing Committee of the French National Peace Council, the Paris Regional Federation of Trade Unions, the Intellectuals' Committee for the Defense of Freedom, the French National Association of Resistance Movement Participants, and others have protested this police brutality and demanded the immediate release of those arrested.
    "L'Humanité" commented on the French government's new arrests, saying: The French rulers often arrest patriots when they are plotting to sell out national interests. For example, when "L'Humanité" editor-in-chief André Stil was first arrested on May 25 last year, it was on the eve of the French government's signing of the Bonn war treaty. On the 27th, when Ridgway arrived in Paris, the government imprisoned French Communist Party Secretary Jacques Duclos.
    Some bourgeois newspapers in Paris also frankly admitted this. "Paris News" said: One can see "the relationship between this show of force and the French ministers' trip to Washington." "Combat" said: The government hopes these measures will "help the negotiations being conducted across the Atlantic."

    法国人民抗议法政府逮捕爱国民主领袖
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十五日讯：法国政府当局在二十四日逮捕民主领袖并且搜查工会办公处，这件事已经引起全国的愤怒和抗议。
    巴黎区、马赛、尼斯、南特、布列斯特及其他城市许多企业的职工纷纷集会，并宣布短时罢工。有些城市的劳动人民派代表团到国民议会去，要求立即释放被捕爱国者。法国全国和平理事会常设委员会、巴黎区工会联合会、知识分子保卫自由委员会、法国全国抵抗运动参加者协会等，都抗议这种警察暴行，并要求立即释放被捕者。
    “人道报”在评论法国政府这次新的逮捕事件时说：法国统治者在阴谋出卖民族利益的时候，常常要逮捕爱国者。例如去年五月二十五日“人道报”总编辑安德烈·斯梯第一次被捕时，正是法国政府签订波恩战争条约的前夕。二十七日，李奇微到巴黎的时候，政府就把法国共产党书记雅克·杜克洛关进牢里。
    巴黎一些资产阶级报纸对这一点也不讳言。“巴黎急进新闻”说：人们可以看出“这种表现力量的事情和法国部长们去华盛顿一事的关系”。“战斗报”说：政府希望这些措施将“有助于在大西洋彼岸进行的谈判”。
