Editor's Note: Readers Zou Zhiyi and Sun Qingping's suggestions on new brick specifications and new concrete mix proportions are very meaningful. It is hoped that construction engineering departments in various regions will further study and discuss them and put forward opinions, especially those regions that have implemented or are conducting new brick experiments should promptly report to the Central Construction Engineering Department and introduce the experience of the experimental work to this newspaper.

Suggestion to the Central Construction Engineering Department to Promptly Announce and Promote New Brick Specifications
To the Editor: At the First National Construction Engineering Conference held in July last year, the conference discussed and approved the unification of the national brick size to 240×115×53 mm and 177×115×53 mm (six-point header) as a temporary standard for trial implementation, and also passed the "Standard for Spacing and Height of Ordinary Brick and Wood Buildings." Due to a lack of experience and data, it was decided that various regions would conduct experiments after the meeting in order to make further supplements and revisions before announcing and implementing them in 1953.

At the end of 1951, the Construction Guidance Committee of the Central Financial and Economic Commission organized a relatively extensive discussion on the new brick specifications. More than 20 relevant basic construction units, including relevant central agencies, the North China Region, Beijing, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, participated in the discussion, which was conducted under the guidance of Soviet expert Chumiski. The discussion was supported by the majority of the units and agreed to by Soviet experts. The Soviet experts pointed out that this specification is in line with the principles of the Soviet brick specification of 257×123×55 mm.

The principle of the new brick is: four lengths, eight widths, and sixteen thicknesses plus mortar joints all equal one meter. Its superiority over old bricks is that the brick plus mortar joints can be proportional to one meter. In design, a certain law can be grasped, and the same law can be further extended to various building materials and accessories, so that they can be scientifically, simply, and accurately matched. This can save design capacity, improve design level, simplify valuation procedures, save materials, avoid brick cutting, improve construction efficiency, and shorten construction time, which will play a certain role in increasing production and practicing economy in construction and ensuring the overfulfillment of tasks.

The standardization of bricks is the main foundation for construction to move towards standardization, so we should attach importance to this issue. However, the Central Construction Engineering Department has ignored its importance, which is reflected in the following points:

(1) There was no organization, inspection, and supervision of the implementation of the conference resolutions. For example: 1. The leaders of the Central Construction Engineering Department and the leaders of the Design Department did not organize, arrange, and grasp the experimental work after the meeting; 2. No investigation was conducted on whether experiments were carried out in various regions across the country after the meeting and the experimental situation.

(2) There was no good support for the experimental plan proposed by the lower levels—although the work plan for typical demonstrations was approved at that time, the leaders did not personally grasp it under the pretext of being busy. Manqiu, the director of the Design Department, opposed the typical demonstrations and the suggestion that there must be unified leadership, and only designated the design work to be the responsibility of the Design Department and the construction work to be hosted by the Engineering Company. However, he rarely intervened in the entire work process, which affected the demonstration work. For example, because the kiln workers were not ideologically mobilized, the new bricks produced were of very poor quality, which affected the experimental results. For example, the characteristics of the new bricks were not discussed with the workers in advance, so the construction could not be carried out according to the laws of the new bricks in the early stage of construction. Later, through the efforts of comrades, this deviation was corrected, and the work of typical demonstration was completed.

(3) Neglecting the summary of experience and promotion work—the leaders of the Engineering Department and the director of the Design Department, Manqiu, did not participate in the summary work of the typical demonstration, nor did they give any principled instructions. Thanks to the efforts of comrades in various units, the summary of new bricks was completed in November, but the leadership did not promptly study this summary. Under the constant urging of the lower levels, the summary was submitted to the Central Financial and Economic Commission; in January, the Central Financial and Economic Commission instructed the department to announce the trial implementation, but the leaders of the department did not immediately implement it, but instead re-submitted the summary to the Design Institute for re-examination. Until now, the new brick issue has not been resolved. During this stage, we urged the Secretariat of the Design Department, the Office, and the Minister's Office more than ten times, and made written suggestions three times, including a comprehensive promotion plan (including the work plan for design, production, construction, and publicity and education), but it has not been processed so far.

Because the Central Construction Engineering Department did not clearly announce the promotion of new bricks, kiln factories in various regions often wrote to inquire, but the Engineering Department did not reply, which affected their production plans. The masses are also infinitely concerned about this issue. For example, the People's Daily and the Workers' Daily have forwarded many readers' suggestions to unify the brick specifications and add the firing of "six-point headers." These problems were proposed to be solved in the proposal to unify new bricks, but because they were not announced and publicized, the masses did not know about them. In this way, the Construction Engineering Department lagged far behind the needs of the masses and did not play its due leading role.

The basic construction project will start soon this year, and the preparation time is already very short. It is suggested that the Central Construction Engineering Department seize the time to correct erroneous tendencies and quickly announce the specifications of new bricks to promote the accelerated completion of the basic construction cause and improve the quality of basic construction.

My Suggestions for Promoting New Concrete Mix Proportions
To the Editor: Concrete engineering is an extremely important part of construction. The length of the building's life and the quality of the concrete are closely related, and the quality of the concrete is closely related to the concrete mix proportions. For decades, concrete engineering in our country has been using the old volume mix proportions of 1:2:4 and 1:3:6, etc., which is an unreasonable and rigid working method that hinders the improvement of the technical level of construction engineering in our country.

Since liberation, the issue of abolishing the old concrete mix proportions and how to improve the quality of concrete has attracted the attention of construction engineering departments. The Research Institute of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government has done a lot of experiments on changing the old concrete mix proportions and has implemented them in actual construction (such as the Tanggu Dam project, the Capital People's Swimming Pool project, etc.). Facts have proved that the concrete using the new mix proportions (weight ratio) far exceeds the old concrete mix proportions in terms of quality and material saving. Therefore, in today's large-scale basic construction in our country, the widespread promotion of new concrete mix proportions is a very important task.

In the autumn of 1951, in order to cooperate with the concrete engineering construction of a certain military commission construction site, we went deep into the site to conduct new mix proportion experiments. Because the tools for preparing concrete on the construction site were not complete, and the workers were not familiar with the weight mix proportion operation method, we did not completely adopt the weight ratio, but still adopted the volume mix proportion. However, this is different from the old 1:2:4 mix proportion. It is based on the nature, shape, and size of the concrete raw materials (cement, sand, stone) on the construction site. First, the weight per unit volume is converted, and then the water-cement ratio and workability (moderate consistency) are selected according to the shape, nature, and engineering nature of the cement, sand, and stone. Then, the weight mix proportion test is carried out to obtain the weight mix proportion of these cement, sand, and stone. Then, according to the relationship between the volume and weight of cement, sand, and stone, the volume ratio equivalent to the weight ratio is converted. This way, the new concrete mix proportion can be obtained. In the concrete construction on the construction site, attention should be paid to the curing of the concrete and the control of the amount of water added to the concrete. We originally stipulated that the curing period of concrete was three weeks, but due to the urgent completion date of the project at that time, the curing of concrete could generally only be done for ten days. The amount of water added during concrete mixing was controlled by the slump test.

Now the fact has proved that the advantages of using this new concrete mix proportion are: (1) Good workability (moderate consistency). Since the mix proportion test was first carried out according to the shape and nature of the concrete raw materials before the concrete engineering construction, and a mix proportion with better workability was obtained, the stirring and tamping of these concrete projects during construction are not only labor-saving and time-saving, but also very uniform. Therefore, after removing the formwork of such concrete projects, the surface of the concrete is smooth and flat. (2) Good strength. Generally speaking, the compressive strength (that is, compressive strength) of concrete using the new weight mix proportion method is 20% to 50% higher than that of the old volume mix proportion. (3) Saving materials. The result of the new mix proportion construction can save 46.8 kg of cement per cubic meter compared with the old mix proportion (the amount of ash used per cubic meter of 1:2:4 mix proportion is calculated based on the minimum of 325 kg), that is, the new method saves 14.4% of cement. (4) Increase the design stress (strength). The strength of the new mix proportion is much higher than that of the old mix proportion, so the original design stress can be increased. For example, in the past, the strength required for 28 days was 140 kg per square centimeter, but with the new mix proportion, the stress can be increased to 170 to 200 kg per square centimeter. Due to the increase in design stress, a lot of building materials can be saved.

When implementing the new concrete mix proportion operation method, we must first obtain the support of the leaders and fight against the conservative ideas. When the new mix proportion was first used on the construction site, it was opposed by many people. Some engineers believed that this was "doing something different" and was "violating decades of construction experience"; the workers said that they "have been making cement for many years and have not changed the way." In order to overcome these ideological obstacles, we used the compressive strength of the new and old mix proportions and the specific facts that the new mix proportion is labor-saving, time-saving, and easy to tamp during mixing to prove the advantages of this new mix proportion and get through their minds. After the ideology was clarified, the next step was to organize the learning of the new mix proportion construction operation method. This is very important for workers to improve construction technology, ensure project quality, and save national wealth.

In order to improve the quality of concrete—and also to improve the quality of buildings, I suggest that the construction department promote this new weight mix proportion.

### 关于推行建筑器材新规格的建议

    关于推行建筑器材新规格的建议
    编者按：读者邹至毅、孙氰萍关于新砖规格和新的混凝土配合比的建议很有意义。希望各地建筑工程部门进一步研究讨论并提出意见，特别是希望已经推行或正在进行新砖试验的地区及时向中央建筑工程部报告，并向本报介绍试验工作的经验。
    建议中央建筑工程部迅速公布推行新砖规格
    编辑同志：在去年七月间召开的第一次全国建筑工程会议上，讨论并通过了统一全国砖的尺度为二四○×一一五×五三公厘，和一七七×一一五×五三公厘（六分头）作为暂行标准试行，同时通过 “普通砖木建筑间距和高度的标准”。由于缺乏经验与资料，决定各地在会后进行试验，以便作进一步的补充和修改后在一九五三年公布施行。
    一九五一年底中央财政经济委员会建筑指导委员会曾对新砖规格组织过比较广泛的讨论，参加讨论的包括中央有关机关、华北区、北京市和全国总工会等二十余个有关基本建设单位，并在苏联专家丘米斯基指导下进行，得到大多数单位的拥护和苏联专家的赞同，苏联专家并指出这个规格和苏联的二五七×一二三×五五公厘砖的规格的原则相符合。
    新砖的原则是：四块长，八块宽，和十六块厚加上灰缝都等于一公尺。它比旧砖的优越性是砖加上灰缝能与一公尺成比例，在设计上能掌握一定的规律，进一步把同样的规律推广到各种建筑材料和配件，使它们能够很科学地、简单地、准确地配合起来。这样可以节约设计能力，提高设计水平，简化估价手续，节省材料，避免打砖，提高施工效率，缩短施工时间，对建筑的增产节约与保证超额完成任务，都起一定的作用。
    砖的规格化是建筑走向规格化的主要基础，所以我们应重视这个问题，可是中央建筑工程部却漠视了它的重要性，这表现在以下几点：
    （一）对会议决议的执行没有进行组织、检查和监督工作，例如：1、会后中央建筑工程部的领导上和设计处的领导上都没有组织、布置和掌握试验工作；2、对全国各地会后是否进行试验和试验情况没有进行调查。
    （二）对下级提出的试验计划没有很好的支持——当时虽批准了典型示范的工作计划，但以工作忙为借口而没有亲自掌握，设计处曼丘处长反对典型示范和必须有统一领导的建议，只是指定设计工作由设计处负责，施工工作由工程公司主持，而在整个工作过程中，很少过问，使示范工作受到影响，例如因为对窑厂职工没有作思想动员，故造出的新砖规格很差，影响了试验的效果。又如没有事先和工人讨论新砖的特性，以致施工初期不能按照新砖的规律进行，后来经同志们的努力，才把这偏向纠正，完成了典型示范的工作。
    （三）忽视总结经验和推广工作——工程部的领导和设计处曼丘处长都没有参加典型示范的总结工作，也未作任何原则性指示。由于各单位同志的努力，在十一月间完成了新砖的总结，但领导上对这个总结没有及时研究，在下级不断催促下才将总结转呈中央财政经济委员会；一月间中央财政经济委员会指示由部公布试行，部的领导上没有立即执行，却将总结再交设计院重新审核，直到如今新砖问题尚未得到解决。在这一阶段中，我们向设计处秘书处、办公室、部长办公室曾催促十多次，又曾三次作书面建议，其中包括全面的推广计划（包括设计、生产、施工和宣传教育的工作计划），但到目前还没有处理。
    由于中央建筑工程部对于推行新砖没有明确公布，各地区窑厂常来信询问，工程部都没有答复，影响了它们的生产计划。群众对这个问题也是无限的关怀，例如人民日报和工人日报都曾转来不少读者建议统一砖的规格和加烧“六分头”的信。这些问题早在统一新砖的建议中提出了解决办法，但因没有公布和宣传，群众不得而知，这样，建筑工程部就远远的落在群众需要的后面，没有起它应起的领导作用。
    今年基本建设工程马上就要开始了，准备的时间已经很短促，建议中央建筑工程部抓紧时间纠正错误的倾向，赶快公布新砖的规格，以推动基本建设事业的加速完成和提高基本建设的质量。

    我对于推行混凝土新配合比的建议
    编辑同志：混凝土工程在建筑上是一个极其重要的部分。建筑物寿命的长短和混凝土质量的好坏关系甚大，而混凝土质量的好坏又和混凝土的配合比有着密切的关系。我国几十年来建筑上的混凝土工程都是沿用一比二比四和一比三比六等旧的体积配合比，这是一种不合理的墨守成规的作业法，它阻碍着我国建筑工程技术水平的提高。
    解放以后，关于废除混凝土旧的配合比以及怎样提高混凝土质量的问题，已经引起建筑工程部门的注意。中央人民政府重工业部基本建设局研究所对于改变混凝土旧的配合比曾经作过很多试验，并且已经贯彻到实际施工中去（如塘沽水坝工程、首都人民游泳池工程等），事实证明采用新的配合比（重量比）的混凝土不管在质量上、节省材料上都远超过了旧的混凝土配合比。因此，在我国大规模基本建设开始的今天，普遍推广新的混凝土配合比是一项十分重要的工作。
        一九五一年秋季，我们为了配合军委某工地的混凝土工程施工，曾深入现场进行新配合比的试验。由于工地捣制混凝土工具还不完备，工人对于采用重量配合比作业法还不熟练，所以，我们没有完全采用重量比，而仍然采用体积配合比，但是这和旧的一比二比四的配合比是不相同的。它是依照工地的混凝土原料（水泥、砂、石子）的性质，形状和大小，先换算出其单位体积的重量，再依照该项水泥、砂、石子的形状、性质和工程性质，选定了水灰比及和易性（稠度适中），进行重量配合比试验，求得这些水泥、砂、石子的重量配合比。再依照水泥、砂、石子体积与重量的关系，换算出相当于该重量比的体积比。这样就可以得出新的混凝土配合比。在工地混凝土施工中，应该注意的是混凝土的养护和控制混凝土的加水量。混凝土的养护日期我们原规定是三个星期，但是由于当时工程完成日期紧迫，所以，对于混凝土的养护一般只能做到十天。控制混凝土拌和时的加水量，是用沉落度试验的。
    现在事实已经证明采用这种新的混凝土配合比的好处是：（一）良好的和易性（稠度适中）。由于在混凝土工程施工前，首先依照混凝土原料的形状和性质作了配合比试验，得出和易性比较好的配合比，因而这些混凝土工程在施工时搅拌和捣制不但省力、省时间，而且拌和得非常均匀。所以，这样的混凝土工程在拆除模型板之后，混凝土的表面都是光滑平整的。（二）强度好。采用新法重量配合比的混凝土工程，耐压强度（即抗压强度）一般来说比旧的体积配合比都高出百分之二十至五十。（三）节省材料。新配合比施工的结果比旧配合比每立方公尺可节省水泥四六点八公斤（一比二比四配合比每立方公尺用灰量以最低的三二五公斤计算），即较旧法节省水泥百分之十四点四。（四）设计应力（强度）提高。新配合比的强度比旧配合比增高很多，因此在原设计应力上可以提高。如以往是二十八天所需要的强度为每平方厘米一百四十公斤，但用新配合比可以将应力提高到每平方厘米一百七十至二百公斤。由于设计应力的提高，可以节省很多的建筑材料。
    在贯彻混凝土新配合比的作业法时，首先必须取得领导的支持和向守旧思想作斗争。新配合比开始在工地使用时，曾遭到不少人的反对。有些工程师认为这是“别出花样”，是“违犯了几十年的施工经验”；工人说他们“打洋灰打了很多年都没有改过样”。为了克服这些思想障碍，我们就用新配合比与旧配合比的耐压强度、新配合比在拌和时省力省时间且易于捣制等具体事实，来证明这种新配合比的优点，搞通了他们的思想。思想搞通后，进一步的工作是组织起来学习新配合比的施工作业法。这对于工人提高施工技术、保证工程质量与节省国家财富是非常重要的。
    为了提高混凝土的质量——也是为了提高建筑物的质量，我建议建筑部门推行这个新的重量配合比。
