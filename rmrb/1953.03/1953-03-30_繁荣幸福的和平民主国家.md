Prosperous, Happy, Peaceful, and Democratic Countries

　　Stalinsk—A Young City in Siberia
　　In Siberia, surrounded by the Kuznetsk Alatau, Salair, and Altai mountains, lies a basin. In the southern part of the basin, there are abundant reserves of coal and iron. During the Soviet Union’s first Stalin Five-Year Plan, on the initiative of Comrade Stalin, the large-scale Kuznetsk Metallurgical Plant was built here. Later, a new city emerged around this factory. This city was named Stalinsk.

　　Stalinsk is now one of the largest industrial and cultural centers in Siberia. It is home to many metallurgical workers, construction workers, railway workers, and miners. Large quantities of coal and steel are shipped from here to all corners of the Soviet Union. The high-quality Kuznetsk steel is made into millions of tractors, lathes, and various other machines. The steel produced in Stalinsk is also used to build the dams and locks of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, the Stalingrad and Kuibyshev hydroelectric power stations, and other great communist construction projects.

　　For twenty years, Stalinsk has become a very magnificent and well-equipped city.

　　The city of Stalinsk is developing rapidly. To date, 1.2 million square meters of housing, four universities, seventy middle and vocational schools, a theater, a cultural palace, and many cinemas, clubs, and libraries have been built in the city. The city has been equipped with running water, sewers have been laid, the roads have been paved with asphalt, and the high-rise buildings have been equipped with heating systems. When summer comes, the entire city of Stalinsk is covered by the green shade of poplar trees and acacia.

　　Many cultural institutions have become centers for metallurgical workers, miners, construction workers, and railway workers to learn various cultures and sciences. The Metallurgical Workers' Cultural Palace, with its technology hall and museum, and the Metallurgical Workers' and Miners' Club, with its library, regularly attract thousands of workers, making them connoisseurs of literature and art. The Kuznetsk Metallurgical Plant Library, with its very rich collection of books, has been of great help to the scientific research work of hundreds of scientists and engineers.

　　Like other cities in the Soviet Union, Stalinsk is now full of scaffolding, and urban construction is proceeding intensely. In the near future, a complex of buildings will appear at the corner of Molotov Street and Kirov Street. A magnificent fourteen-story hotel, the tallest building in the Kuzbass region, will be built there. Not far from it, next to the Metallurgical Workers' Cultural Palace, will be an opera and ballet theater with a capacity of 1,200 people. The theater will be decorated with beautiful and artistic statues and sculptures. Around the central square, there will be the most beautiful hotels, theaters, and there will be fountains and flower beds everywhere.

　　Near the ancient Kuznetsk Fortress, a wide Lenin Avenue will appear, and on both sides of this street, many beautiful and well-equipped houses and apartments will be built. Lenin Avenue will become one of the most prosperous and lively streets in Stalinsk.

　　The city's cultural facilities will continue to increase. The new Metallurgical Workers' Cultural Palace, the Construction Workers' Club, and the Miners' Technical Hall will soon be completed. After that, some middle schools, children's art education halls, mining technical schools, music schools, new student dormitories, and libraries will be built. The area of the central park will be expanded to nearly 300 hectares. The environment and equipment of the summer leisure places for the working people are also constantly being improved.

　　This city named after the great Stalin, more than 4,000 kilometers away from Moscow, is changing its face day by day.

　　The "East" Metallurgical Combine on the Oder River
　　Near the city of Fürstenberg on the Oder River, the "East" Metallurgical Combine is being built, which is the largest construction project in the German Democratic Republic's Five-Year Plan. The plant's No. 4 blast furnace and sintering plant have already been put into operation, and the construction of the No. 5 blast furnace is now beginning.

　　This year, the scale of construction work has been further expanded. The construction of steelmaking workshops and rolling workshops, thermal power plants, and other projects is now underway. More than fifty construction organizations and thousands of construction workers from various states of the Republic are participating in the construction of this combined factory. "The construction project of our people"—the working people of the Republic always proudly call the "East" Metallurgical Combine.

　　While blast furnaces and workshops are being built, a large number of residential and cultural buildings have also been built here. Among the first completed construction projects of the combined factory are a comprehensive hospital and cultural palace built for the workers. Next to the ancient city of Fürstenberg, a new city is being built, which people call the first socialist city in the German Democratic Republic. Now, hundreds of workers, technicians, engineers, and staff members live in comfortable new houses.

　　By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the residents of this city under construction will reach 30,000. Near the city square, buildings such as the City Council, the Central Cultural Palace, and cinemas will be built. In this new city, primary and middle schools, kindergartens and nurseries will also be built for children, and sports schools, stadiums, and the "Free German Youth League Palace" will be built for young people. The Republic's government is constantly concerned about the health and living needs of the working people. Near the "East" Combined Factory, this new city will have a hospital with 600 beds, which will be equipped with comprehensive clinics, night sanatoriums, as well as shops and laundries, and a huge library.

　　Not long ago, the Rudi Zandta working team, which is famous for building Berlin's Stalin Avenue and has won national prizes, also came to participate in this new construction project. These construction innovators not only overfulfilled the planned quota every day, but also passed on their rich experience to other working teams.

　　Today, the "East" Combined Factory is not only a grand construction project, but also a large-scale metallurgical enterprise that has already started operations; it supplies the national industry with pig iron. Half a year ago, the ironworkers of the combined factory guaranteed in the first collective contract to "use all their strength to supply the metal necessary for the country's peaceful construction." They gloriously fulfilled this promise. In the national metallurgical enterprise competition launched in the fourth quarter of last year, all the ironworkers of the combined factory won the championship.

　　The young construction workers of the combined factory must overcome great difficulties. Skilled workers and experts are lacking, and sabotage by American and Bonn spies is often discovered.

　　But thanks to the vigilance of the workers and staff, and thanks to their selfless labor, all the staff of the combined factory were able to overcome difficulties with confidence and move forward bravely.

　　In the construction project, new and advanced figures emerged, and they drove all the staff with their enthusiasm and fiery creativity. The working teams of young ironworkers Simonaat and Geertz, as well as Budach and Buscher…etc., have all applied new working methods. Not long ago, a technical school was also opened in the combined factory, where 200 workers are studying to improve their skills.

　　If you talk to any worker in the "East" Combined Factory, you will definitely hear stories about Soviet engineers told with excitement. These Soviet engineers came here last spring and gave the workers practical help with their suggestions and actions. On the residential construction site, you can often see bulldozers with Soviet trademarks. The words of bulldozer driver Walter Fester express the feelings of all the construction personnel of the combined factory, he said:

　　"We are very happy to know that we have good friends who help us build a new life. The workers of our metallurgical factory—the residents of the first new city in the German Democratic Republic, will always be loyal friends of the Soviet Union." (Translated from the February 10th "Pravda") (Attached picture)

    繁荣幸福的和平民主国家
    斯大林斯克——西伯利亚的年轻城市
    在西伯利亚的库兹涅茨阿拉泰乌、萨拉依尔和阿尔泰等山脉围抱中，有一块盆地。盆地的南部，蕴藏着大量的煤和铁。在苏联第一个斯大林五年计划期间，根据斯大林同志的倡议，规模宏大的库兹涅茨冶金工厂在这里建筑起来了。后来，在这座工厂的周围，出现了一个新兴的城市。这个城市就被命名为斯大林斯克。
    斯大林斯克现在是西伯利亚最大的工业和文化中心之一。这里居住着许多冶金工人、建筑工人、铁路工人和采矿工人。大批的煤和钢从这里装运到苏联的各个角落去。这些品质优良的库兹涅茨钢被制成了千百万架的拖拉机、车床和其他各种机器。斯大林斯克所出产的钢铁，也被用来建设列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的堤坝和闸门、斯大林格勒和古比雪夫的水力发电站与其他伟大的共产主义建设工程。
    二十年来，斯大林斯克已成为一个十分壮丽和设备完善的城市了。
    斯大林斯克城迅速地发展着。到现在为止，在这座城市里已经建造了一百二十万平方公尺居住面积的住房、四所高等学校、七十所中学和专科中学、一座剧院、一座文化宫以及很多的电影院、俱乐部和图书馆等。市内已装置了自来水，铺设了下水道，马路上都铺上了柏油，在高楼大厦中都装置了暖气设备。当夏季来临的时候，整个斯大林斯克就被白杨树和金合欢的绿荫所覆盖。
    许多文化机构成为冶金工人、矿工、建筑工人和铁路工人们的学习各种文化与科学的活动中心。设有技术馆和博物馆的冶金工人文化宫，附有图书馆的冶金工人和矿工的俱乐部，经常吸引着数千的工人，使他们成为文学和艺术的鉴赏家。藏书非常丰富的库兹涅茨冶金工厂图书馆，对于几百个科学工作者和工程师的科学研究工作，起了极大的帮助作用。
    像苏联其他的城市一样，斯大林斯克城现在正布满着建筑架，城市建设正在紧张进行。不久的将来，在莫洛托夫大街和基洛夫大街的转角上就要出现一个建筑上的综合体。那里将建立起一幢在库兹巴斯地区最高的大楼来，那是一幢十四层高的富丽堂皇的旅馆。离它不远的地方，在冶金工人文化宫的旁边就要出现一座能容纳一千二百人的歌剧和巴蕾舞剧院。这座剧院将由美丽的富有艺术性的塑像和雕刻装饰起来。在中央广场的周围还有最漂亮的旅馆、戏院，而且到处都要有喷水池和花坛。
    在古老的库兹涅茨堡垒近旁，将要出现一条宽广的列宁大街，在这条街的两旁，将建造起许多美观的、设备完善的住宅和公寓。列宁大街将成为斯大林斯克最繁荣热闹的大街之一。
    城内的文化设施将要继续增加。新的冶金工人文化宫、建筑工人俱乐部和矿工们的技术馆马上就要完工了。此后，还要建设起一些中学、儿童艺术教育馆、矿工技术学校、音乐学校、新的学生宿舍和图书馆。中央公园的面积将要扩充到近三百公顷。劳动人民的夏令休憩场所的环境与设备也正在不断改善中。
    这个远离莫斯科四千多公里的以伟大的斯大林命名的城市，正在日新月异地改变着自己的面貌。
    奥得河畔的“东方”冶金联合工厂
    在奥得河畔费尔斯登堡城附近，正在兴建着“东方”冶金联合工厂，这是德意志民主共和国五年计划中规模最大的一个建设工程。该厂的第四号鼓风炉和烧结工厂都已经开炉了，现在正在开始建筑第五号鼓风炉。
    今年，建筑工作的规模就更加扩展了。现在正在进行着炼钢车间和压延车间、火力发电站以及其他建设的建筑工作。参加这个联合工厂建筑工作的，有五十多个建筑机构和成千的来自共和国各州的建筑工人。“我们人民的建设工程”——共和国的劳动人民总是满怀骄傲地这样来称呼“东方”冶金联合工厂。
    与兴建鼓风炉和车间的同时，这里还大量地兴建了住宅和文化建筑。在联合工厂第一批完成的建筑工程中，有为工人建造的综合医院和文化宫。在古老的费尔斯登堡城的旁边，正在建设着一座新的城市，人们称呼它为德意志民主共和国的第一个社会主义城市。现在已有好几百工人、技术员、工程师和职员居住在舒服的新房子里了。
    到五年计划的结束时，这个正在兴建着的城市的居民将达到三万人。城市的广场附近，将要建造起市议会、中央文化宫、电影院等建筑。在这个新城市中，还要为儿童们建筑小学和中学、幼儿园和托儿所，为青年们建筑体育学校、运动场、“自由德意志青年联盟之宫”。共和国政府对于劳动人民的健康与生活需求表示着不断的关怀。在“东方”联合工厂的附近，这个新城市将有一个拥有六百张病床的医院，这个医院设有综合诊疗所，夜间疗养院，此外还将有好些商店和洗浆房，以及一个规模巨大的图书馆。
    不久以前，以建筑柏林的斯大林大街而闻名的、曾获得国家奖金的鲁迪·让德塔工作队，也来参加了这个新的建设工程。这些建筑工作革新者不但自己每天超额完成了计划的定额，而且还将自己丰富的经验传授给其他的工作队。
    今天，“东方”联合工厂已不仅仅是一个宏大的建设工程，而且是一个规模巨大的、已经开工了的冶金企业；它以生铁供给着国家工业。半年前，联合工厂的炼铁工人在第一个集体合同中保证要“用一切力量来供给国家和平建设所必需的金属”。他们光荣地实现了这个诺言。在全国冶金企业于去年第四季度所展开的竞赛中，联合工厂的全体炼铁工人获得了优胜。
    联合工厂的青年建筑工作者们必须克服巨大的困难。熟练工人和专家都感到缺乏，而且时常发现美国和波恩特务的破坏。
    但是由于工人们和职员们的警惕，由于他们忘我的劳动，联合工厂的全体工作人员得以满怀信心地克服困难，勇敢地前进。
    在建设工程中，产生了新的、先进的人物，他们以自己的热情与火一般的创造力带动了全体工作人员。年青的炼铁工人席蒙纳特和盖尔茨，以及布达赫与布雪尔的工作队……等等，都应用了新的工作方法。不久以前，在联合工厂还开办了技术学校，有两百名工人在那里学习，以提高自己的技术。
    如果你和“东方”联合工厂的任何工人谈一谈，你就一定会听见以激动的心情讲出来的关于苏联工程师的故事，这些苏联工程师去年春天来到这里，以自己的建议和行动给予工人们以实际的帮助。在住宅建筑的现场上，你不时可以看见带有苏联商标的推土机。推土机手华尔特尔·费斯特的话表达了联合工厂全体建筑人员的心情，他说：
    “我们很高兴，知道我们有着帮助我们建设新生活的好朋友。我们冶金工厂的工人们——这个德意志民主共和国的第一个新城市的居民，将永远是苏联的忠实朋友。”（译自二月十日“真理报”）（附图片）
