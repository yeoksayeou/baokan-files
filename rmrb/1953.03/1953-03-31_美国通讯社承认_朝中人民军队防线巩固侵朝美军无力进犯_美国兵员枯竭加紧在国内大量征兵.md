    Xinhua News Agency: Despite the repeated clamoring of American generals to carry out military adventures in Korea, even American news agencies admit that the Korean and Chinese People's Army is invincible, and the invading American forces lack the strength to carry out such adventures.
    International News Service, Seoul, 21st dispatch, admits: The Korean and Chinese People's Army, fighting the American invading forces on the Korean front, possesses strong forces and "sufficient supplies." The dispatch quoted the words of the commander of the U.S. Fifth Air Force, Backus, who admitted that "their warplanes have not been able to cut off the communist army's supply lines." The dispatch also said: "Across the Korean peninsula, the Eighth Army is facing a strong communist army fortress. The communist army has defenses at least twenty-five miles deep in many places, with crisscrossing tunnels and large caves underground, some of which actually penetrate the solid mountain strongholds." According to International News Service reporter Hamoff, a senior American officer admitted that the solidity of the Korean and Chinese People's Army's defenses cannot be destroyed by any weapon.
    Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch, Washington: The Eisenhower government, on the one hand, is releasing the so-called "disengagement" policy in Korea to deceive the people, and on the other hand, is stepping up the recruitment of American youth to serve as cannon fodder in the war of aggression.
    According to the U.S. Department of the Army's conscription order, the number of recruits in the United States for February, March, and April is 53,000 per month. This is 10 percent more than the 48,000 recruited in January, and about 37 percent more than the average monthly recruitment in the second half of 1952. According to the Department of Defense: the United States will "continue to recruit in large numbers" in the future.
    In order to cope with the increasing need for troops, the U.S. Selective Service System is preparing to expand the scope of recruitment. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 23rd: Because young people aged 20 to 26 have already been "drafted as needed," "41 states in the United States will draft 19-year-olds next month," "For 14 of the 40 states, this will be the first time since World War II that 19-year-olds have been drafted." In 13 states, the 19-year-olds scheduled to be drafted in April will account for at least 50 percent of the conscription quota. The soldiers to be recruited in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and California are mostly 19-year-olds.
    At the same time, the U.S. government is preparing to adopt a stricter conscription system to step up the search for cannon fodder. Responsible officials of the U.S. Department of Defense and the Selective Service System have recently repeatedly demanded that the current conscription law be revised, especially to adopt a "tougher policy" on the issue of deferments. Selective Service Director Hershey has suggested issuing an executive order to raise the deferment conditions for college students and new fathers. Assistant Secretary of Defense Hannah, who is in charge of manpower mobilization, also assured the Senate that he would re-examine the entire manpower situation. According to the Associated Press: "Some stricter draft law drafts are currently on Eisenhower's desk."

    美国通讯社承认
    朝中人民军队防线巩固侵朝美军无力进犯
    美国兵员枯竭加紧在国内大量征兵
    【新华社讯】尽管美国将军们一再叫嚣要在朝鲜进行军事冒险，但是连美国通讯社也承认：朝中人民军队强不可犯，侵朝美军力不从心。
    国际新闻社汉城二十一日电承认：在朝鲜前线抗击着美国侵略军的朝中人民军队拥有强大的兵力和“足够的供应品”。消息引述了美国第五航空队司令巴克斯的话，巴克斯承认，“他们作战飞机没有能切断共军的供应线”。该消息并说：“横贯朝鲜半岛，第八军所面临的是一个强大的共军堡垒。共军在许多地方有纵深至少二十五英里的防线，地下是纵横交错的坑道和大地洞，有些地洞实际上穿透了坚强的山头阵地。”据国际新闻社记者哈莫夫透露，一个美国高级军官承认，朝中人民军队防线的巩固，是任何武器都无法摧毁的。 【新华社二十九日讯】华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔政府一方面放出所谓准备在朝鲜采取“脱身”政策的空气来欺骗人民，另一方面却在加紧征召美国青年入伍，充当侵略战争的炮灰。
    根据美国陆军部发布的征兵令，美国在二、三、四月每月的征兵人数为五万三千名。这比一月份征召的四万八千人多百分之十，比一九五二年下半年平均每月的征兵人数约多百分之三十七。据国防部透露：美国今后还要“继续大量征兵”。
    为了应付不断增加的兵员需要，美国征兵局正在准备扩大征兵的范围。据美联社二十三日消息：由于二十岁到二十六岁的青年都已“该征的征了”，“美国四十一个州将在下月征调十九岁的青年入伍”，“对于四十个州中的十四个州来说，这将是第二次世界大战以来第一次征调十九岁的青年入伍”。有十三个州在四月份准备征召的十九岁青年至少要占征兵额百分之五十。伊利诺斯、宾夕法尼亚与加利福尼亚等州要征召的士兵，大部分都是十九岁的青年。
    同时，美国政府正准备采取更严格的征兵制度来加紧搜罗炮灰。美国国防部与征兵局的负责官员近来不断要求修改现行的征兵法，特别要在缓役问题上采取“更强硬的政策”。征兵局长赫尔希已建议发布行政命令，提高大学生与新做父亲的人的缓役条件。负责人力动员的国防部助理部长汉纳也向参议院保证要重新研究整个的人力情况。据美联社透露：“目前在艾森豪威尔的办公桌上，正放着一些更加严格的征兵法草案。”
