　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 28th: The illegal resolution on the Korean issue passed by the Seventh UN General Assembly supported the US side's unreasonable position on the prisoner-of-war issue, which made the US side even more unscrupulous in sabotaging the armistice negotiations. From December 13th of last year to February 22nd of this year, the US side systematically created a series of provocative incidents to sabotage the agreement.

　　On December 13th of last year, US aircraft attacked the supply vehicles of our delegation, which had clear signs agreed upon by both sides, injuring five members of the delegation staff. The US side has not responded to our protest regarding this incident and has instead intensified its actions. On January 15th of this year, it unilaterally tore up the agreement on the immunity of delegation vehicles from attacks, notifying us that from January 25th, delegation vehicles would only be immune from attack one day a week, on Sundays. Less than a week later, on January 21st, US aircraft strafed our delegation vehicles again, injuring three members of the delegation staff. In the face of the ample evidence and eyewitness accounts provided by our side, the US side still attempted to deny its responsibility for this perfidy and violation of the agreement.

　　At the same time, the US side further tore up the agreement on the prohibition of hostile actions by both sides' armed forces in the conference area and the neutral zone. On December 16th, 17th, 18th, 24th, and 26th of last year, US aircraft continuously intruded into the conference area. Because the evidence was conclusive and undeniable, the US side had to admit to some of these incidents and, as usual, guaranteed that similar incidents would not occur in the future. However, on January 2nd of this year, the US side brazenly refused to take responsibility for the US aircraft's intrusion into the conference area, absurdly claiming that "such overflights do not violate the existing spirit of understanding between the liaison officers." After this, on January 4th, 7th, and 24th, and February 4th, 16th, and 22nd, US aircraft continued to intrude into the conference area. The US side either turned a deaf ear to these violations of the agreement, pretending not to know, or refused to take responsibility. In reality, the US side has turned Panmunjom into an observation post for their air force. American aircraft frequently use the neutrality of the conference area to evade our army's anti-aircraft fire, flying over the conference area to scout and bomb our nearby positions. When US aircraft fly over the conference area to attack our positions, US Air Force officers spread out maps in front of the tents at Panmunjom to study them.

　　Not only that, but the US side also used aircraft to distribute slanderous leaflets in the conference area and shelled the conference area twice, on December 20th of last year and January 23rd of this year. Regarding these two shelling incidents, due to the presence of evidence, the US side finally had to admit them after a long delay.

　　The US side not only violated the conference area from the air with aircraft but also dispatched armed personnel to intrude into the conference area to carry out provocations. On February 10th, the US side dispatched armed personnel to intrude into the conference area and set fire to a civilian house. On February 12th, US armed personnel again intruded into the conference area and shot and wounded one of our military police officers.

　　All of these increasingly arrogant provocative acts by the US side prove that, encouraged by the illegal resolution on the Korean issue passed by the UN General Assembly, the US side, in order to prevent the resumption of negotiations, has further adopted the means of directly tearing up the remaining agreements that serve as the basis for negotiations, attempting to eliminate the existence of the conference area and the neutral zone, thereby leading to the complete breakdown of the armistice negotiations, which have already been unilaterally suspended by the US side.

    在联大通过关于朝鲜问题的非法决议支持下
    美方制造了一连串破坏协议的挑衅事件
    【新华社开城二十八日电】联合国第七届大会关于朝鲜问题的非法决议案支持了美方在战俘问题上的无理立场，这就使美方更加肆无忌惮地破坏停战谈判。从去年十二月十三日到今年二月二十二日为止，美方有计划地制造了一连串破坏协议的挑衅事件。
    去年十二月十三日，美方飞机袭击设有双方协议的明显标志的我方代表团供应车辆，打伤代表团工作人员五人。对于我方就这次事件提出的抗议，美方一直不作答复，并且反而变本加厉，竟在今年一月十五日片面撕毁关于代表团车辆不受袭击的协议，通知我方从一月二十五日起，代表团车辆每星期只有星期日一天不受攻击。在这以后不到一个星期，一月二十一日，美方又用飞机扫射我方代表团车辆，打伤代表团工作人员三名。在我方提供的充分的人证物证面前，美方还企图拒绝承认这种背信弃义、破坏协议的责任。
    与此同时，美方进一步撕毁了关于双方武装力量不得在会场区和中立区进行敌对行动的协议。在去年十二月十六日、十七日、十八日、二十四日、二十六日，美方飞机不断侵入会场区。由于证据确凿，不容抵赖，美方不得不承认了其中的几次，并且照例保证以后不再发生类似事件。但是到了今年一月二日，美方竟然横蛮地拒绝承担美机侵越会场区的责任，荒谬地声称“这种飞越并不违反联络官之间现存的谅解精神”。在此以后，一月四日、七日、二十四日，二月四日、十六日、二十二日，美机继续侵越会场区。对于这些违反协议事件，美方不是装聋作瞎，假作不知，就是拒绝承担责任。实际上，美方已经把板门店当作他们空军的观测所。美国飞机经常利用会场区的中立性逃避我军的高射炮火，飞越会场区去侦察和轰炸附近的我军阵地。当美机飞过会场区袭击我军阵地时，美方空军军官就在板门店的帐篷前摊开地图进行研究。
    不仅如此，美方还用飞机在会场区散发诬蔑性的传单，并且在去年十二月二十日和今年一月二十三日两次炮击会场区。对于这两次炮击事件，由于证据俱在，美方在拖延很久以后，终于不得不加以承认。
    美方不但用飞机从空中侵犯会场区，而且派遣武装人员侵入会场区进行挑衅。二月十日，美方派遣武装人员侵入会场区，纵火焚烧民房一所。二月十二日，美方武装人员又侵入会场区，开枪打伤我方军事警察一名。
    美方这一切越来越蛮横的挑衅行为，证明在联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的非法决议案鼓励之下，美方为了使谈判无法恢复，已经进一步采取了直接撕毁作为谈判基础的各项残存协议的手段，企图取消会场区和中立区的存在，从而使已被美方片面中断的停战谈判最后完全破裂。
