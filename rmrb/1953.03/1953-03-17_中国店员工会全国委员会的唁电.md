Condolence Message from the National Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees' Union to the Central Council of Trade Unions of Czechoslovakia:
    The passing of Comrade Gottwald, the great leader of the Czechoslovak people and a close friend of the Chinese people, has caused immense grief to all shop employees and workers in China. We extend to you our deepest condolences.
    We are determined, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to unite with the Czechoslovak people and strive to further strengthen the cause of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to fight for a better future for mankind.
