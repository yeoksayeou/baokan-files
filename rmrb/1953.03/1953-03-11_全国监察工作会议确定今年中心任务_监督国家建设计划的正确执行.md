    National Supervision Work Conference Defines This Year's Central Task
    Supervising the Correct Implementation of National Construction Plans
    In order to strengthen supervisory work and ensure the victorious completion of the country's three major tasks this year, the People's Supervision Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government held the Second National Supervision Work Conference from February 19th to 26th.
    The conference was attended by 135 people, including heads of the central government, major administrative regions, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and provincial (municipal) supervision committees, as well as heads of supervision offices of various departments of the Central People's Government. Thirty-two people attended as observers. After Chairman Tan Pingshan delivered the opening speech, Vice Chairman Liu Jingfan made a report on the summary of supervision work from 1951 to 1952 and the tasks for future work. The conference held a heated discussion on the tasks and working methods of supervision work in 1953 and unanimously adopted the report.
    The summary report pointed out that since the First National Supervision Work Conference in April 1951, supervision work has made considerable achievements. During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, people's supervision organs at all levels fully participated in the work of the economy inspection committees, and provided a lot of important materials through the activities of people's complaint reception offices and people's supervision correspondents; in the later stage of the movement, they also participated in the handling of cases, and cooperated with relevant agencies to promptly prevent and correct certain improper handling, which played a certain role in the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement. In the past two years, 408 inspections and examinations have been carried out on land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the sound development of financial and economic systems, industrial and mining enterprise management, basic construction, safety and health, drought and flood prevention, and democratic political construction. At the same time, 28,426 accident cases were investigated and handled. In the inspection work and handling of these cases, the main problems existing in the work were exposed, the root causes were found, improvement suggestions were put forward, errors were corrected, education and punishment were carried out separately for those who violated laws or neglected their duties, good people and deeds were supported, and bad people and deeds were cracked down, which played a role in consolidating national discipline. The organization of the people's supervision organs has also greatly developed in the past two years. As of the end of October 1952, people's supervision organs had been established in six major administrative regions, one ethnic autonomous region, 45 provinces, cities, leagues, 170 special districts, and 1,160 counties, and supervision organizations had been established in 248 provincial and municipal-level business departments; 26,611 people's supervision correspondents were set up in various agencies, organizations, and urban and rural residents.
    However, there are still shortcomings in the supervision work. The main ones are the failure to understand the situation in a timely manner, to combine with the central work in a planned manner, to combat the main trends; the failure to make full use of typical cases to widely publicize and educate the broad masses of cadres and people; in the handling of people's complaints, there are still bureaucratic styles of procrastination and delay; the leading aspects of supervision commissions at all levels have not done enough to summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner and to guide the work of lower levels. In addition, the leading cadres of some local people's governments and some departments do not pay enough attention to supervision work, thus neglecting the establishment of supervision organizations and relaxing the leadership of supervision organs.
    The phenomena of violations of laws and dereliction of duty among state organs and staff members have been hit to some extent and aroused vigilance after two years of education and punishment, especially after the "Three-Anti" movement. However, because the main focus of the "Three-Anti" movement was on corrupt elements, after the "Three-Anti" movement, bureaucracy, commandism, and various violations of laws and disciplines, as well as dereliction of duty, still existed seriously.
    Vice Chairman Liu pointed out in the report that, according to the three major national tasks in 1953 and the main trends in the current state organs and staff, the task of the people's supervision organs in 1953 is: focusing on supervising the correct implementation of national policies and laws and construction plans, especially the implementation of economic construction plans, to continue to fight against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines, to strictly enforce national laws and disciplines, and to improve the sense of responsibility of staff members, so as to ensure the victorious completion of the three major national tasks, especially the economic construction plans. To this end, it is necessary to fight against bureaucracy in leading organs and leading cadres, supervise them to earnestly implement the mass line of "combining general calls with specific leadership; combining leadership with the masses" and to truly establish a pragmatic work style. It is necessary to fight against coercion and command and violations of laws and disciplines in grassroots organizations and grassroots cadres; to supervise them to strictly abide by national laws and disciplines and to promote a democratic work style. It is necessary to fight against the phenomena of no government and no discipline that violate national construction plans, economic accounting systems, security systems, financial systems, and violate policies and laws in various economic, cultural and educational departments, especially in economic departments; to supervise state financial and economic workers, strengthen discipline, and ensure the implementation of national construction plans. It is necessary to fight against all phenomena of corruption and waste, especially the phenomenon of waste in state-owned enterprises; to strictly practice integrity and public service, and earnestly implement the policy of increasing production and practicing economy. It is necessary to fight against the phenomenon of leaking state secrets; to earnestly implement the state's confidentiality system.
    But we must recognize that fighting against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines is an arduous and long-term task. Therefore, we should conscientiously inspect and handle those who violate laws or neglect their duties in the regular supervision and inspection of various central tasks, in the fight against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines. When dealing with them, we should adopt the principle of combining education and punishment, resolutely expose and strictly criticize this bad phenomenon that endangers the interests of the country and the people, eliminate bad elements, severely punish those who violate laws or neglect their duties, crack down on bad people and bad deeds, and at the same time, we must support good people and reward good deeds, so as to strictly enforce national laws and disciplines, promote justice, and overcome bureaucratic and commandist styles and violations of laws and disciplines.
    In carrying out the above tasks, supervision organs at all levels should have their own priorities. The central, major administrative region, and provincial (municipal) level supervision commissions should focus on supervising and inspecting industrial and mining, transportation, and trade enterprises and basic construction work, and at the same time pay attention to supervising and inspecting the financial and tax revenue, economic construction, and democratic political construction of governments at all levels above the county level; supervision organs below the special district level should focus on supervising and inspecting the economic construction of counties, districts, and townships, and at the same time pay attention to the supervision and inspection of election movements and grassroots political power organs. Supervision organizations of various business departments should select key points for supervision and inspection more specifically based on the above tasks and the central work of their departments. In addition, in 1953, it is necessary to establish and improve supervision organizations at all levels in a planned manner, train supervision cadres, and appropriately develop people's supervision correspondents and expand the people's supervision network.
    Regarding the question of how to carry out supervision work, the report pointed out that it should be closely combined with the central work, grasp the main trends, concentrate forces, inspect and handle key issues in a high-profile manner, gain experience, promote the general, and must closely combine top-down supervision with bottom-up supervision. However, in the past, not enough work has been done to mobilize the masses for bottom-up supervision and inspection, therefore, in the future, we must strengthen the leadership of the work of people's supervision correspondents and people's complaint reception offices, people's suggestion boxes, and people's inquiry offices, closely connect with the masses, and organize the masses to carry out supervision and inspection. When handling cases, we should correctly implement the principle of "combining education and punishment" and oppose the tendencies of accommodation and indulgence and simple punishment. In order to do a good job in supervision work, supervision organs at all levels must establish a close contact system with the relevant departments and obtain their assistance. At the same time, we must pay attention to investigation and research, be good at summarizing experience, so as to improve the supervision work.
    The conference also made a detailed study of two documents, "Provisional Regulations on Awards and Punishments for State Organs and Their Staff Members of the People's Republic of China (Draft)" and "General Rules for the Establishment of People's Supervision Correspondents by People's Supervision Organs of People's Governments at All Levels (Draft)."
    During the meeting, Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government and Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping of the State Council both came to the meeting and spoke. Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out in his speech that in the past two years, people's supervision organs and supervision staff at all levels have done a lot of work, and the work has been fruitful. At present, the country's large-scale construction is beginning, and the task of people's supervision work is even more important, and it must strictly supervise and inspect the implementation of the national construction plan. Vice Chairman Zhu called on supervision organs and supervision staff at all levels across the country to continue to wage a resolute struggle against the phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines, to grasp the key points, to conscientiously do a good job in supervising production and supervising finance, to strive to learn from the advanced supervision work experience of the Soviet Union, to rely on the masses, to overcome difficulties, and to complete the great task of supervision work. Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping elaborated in detail on the planning and discipline of the country's large-scale construction in his speech. He said: Now the country has entered a new stage of planned construction, and there are close links between various departments and various links. If one department cannot complete its task, it will affect other departments, therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the discipline of various organs and departments and staff members. The people's supervision organs must fulfill their responsibilities in supervising whether government organs and civil servants are fulfilling their duties and in consolidating national discipline. If supervision organs and supervision staff cannot adhere to principles, adhere to their positions, and fight against all kinds of bad things and bad people, then it is their dereliction of duty, which is also their violation of national discipline, which all supervision staff must understand clearly.
    The meeting was concluded by Chairman Tan Pingshan after Vice Chairman Liu Jingfan made a summary. He said: The task of our supervision staff in 1953 is glorious, but it is also arduous. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and with the support of the broad masses of the people across the country, we are determined to implement the tasks and policies decided by this meeting and victoriously complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the country.

    全国监察工作会议确定今年中心任务
    监督国家建设计划的正确执行
    为了加强监察工作，保证今年国家三大任务的胜利完成，中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会在二月十九日到二十六日举行了第二次全国监察工作会议。
    出席这次会议的有中央、各大行政区、内蒙古自治区、各省（市）监察委员会负责人，中央人民政府各部门监察室负责人等一百三十五人。列席三十二人。会议于谭平山主任致开幕词后，刘景范副主任作了一九五一年至一九五二年监察工作总结及今后工作任务的报告。大会对一九五三年监察工作的任务和工作做法展开了热烈的讨论，并一致通过了这个报告。
    总结报告中指出，自从一九五一年四月第一次全国监察工作会议以来，监察工作有不少成绩。在“三反”“五反”运动中，各级人民监察机关全力参加了节约检查委员会的工作，并通过人民检举接待室和人民监察通讯员的活动，提供了许多重要材料；在运动后期还参加了案件的处理工作，协同有关机关及时防止和纠正了某些处理不当的现象，对“三反”运动的胜利，起了一定的作用。两年来，对土地改革、镇压反革命等运动和健全财经制度、工矿企业管理、基本建设、安全卫生、防旱防汛、民主建政等项工作，进行了四百零八次巡视和检查。同时并检查和处理了事故案件两万八千四百二十六件。在检查工作和处理这些案件中，揭发了工作中存在着的主要问题，找出了根源，提出了改进的意见，纠正了错误，对于违法失职人员分别进行了教育和惩戒，支持了好人好事，打击了坏人坏事，起到了巩固国家纪律的作用。两年来人民监察机关的组织也有很大发展。截至一九五二年十月底为止，已在六个大行政区、一个民族自治区、四十五个省、市、盟和一百七十个专区、一千一百六十个县建立了人民察监机关，并有二百四十八个省、市以上的业务部门建立了监察机构；在各机关、团体和城乡居民中，设置了二万六千六百十一名人民监察通讯员。
    但是，监察工作中还存在着缺点。主要的是未能及时地了解情况，有计划地结合中心工作，打击主要倾向；未能充分利用典型案件，广泛进行宣传，教育广大干部与群众；在处理人民控告案件中，仍有拖延迟缓的官僚主义作风；各级监委领导方面及时总结交流经验和指导下级的工作也做的不够。此外，有些地方人民政府和若干部门的领导干部，对监察工作重视不够，因而忽视建立监察机构，放松对监察机关的领导。
    国家机关和工作人员中的违法失职现象，经过两年来的教育和惩戒，特别是经过“三反”运动以后，受到了一些打击，并引起了警惕。但由于“三反”运动的主要锋芒是对着贪污分子，所以在“三反”以后，官僚主义、命令主义和各种违法乱纪以及失职现象仍然严重地存在着。
    刘副主任在报告中提出，根据一九五三年国家三大任务和当前国家机关中及工作人员中的主要倾向，人民监察机关一九五三年的任务是：以监督国家政策法令、建设计划的正确执行，特别是经济建设计划的执行为中心，继续与官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪现象作斗争，严肃国家法纪，提高工作人员责任心，以保证国家当前三大任务特别是经济建设计划的胜利完成。为此，要向领导机关和领导干部中的官僚主义作斗争，监督他们认真贯彻“一般号召与具体领导相结合；领导与群众相结合”的群众路线和切实树立实事求是的工作作风。要向基层组织和基层干部中的强迫命令与违法乱纪作斗争；监督他们严守国家法纪，发扬民主作风。要向各级经济、文教部门中，特别是经济部门中的违背国家建设计划、经济核算制度、保安制度、财政制度以及违背政策、法令的无政府、无纪律的现象作斗争；监督国家财经工作人员，加强纪律性，保证国家建设计划贯彻执行。要向一切贪污、浪费现象，特别是国家企业中的浪费现象作斗争；厉行廉洁奉公，认真贯彻增产节约政策。要向泄露国家机密现象作斗争；认真贯彻国家保密制度。
    但是我们必须认识：向官僚主义、命令主义以及违法乱纪现象进行斗争，是艰巨的长期的任务。因此，我们应当在对各项中心工作的经常监督检查中，在反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争中，认真地检查处理违法失职人员。在处理时，应采取教育与惩戒相结合的方针，坚决地揭发和严格地批判这种危害国家与人民利益的坏现象，清除坏分子，严惩违法失职分子，打击坏人、坏事，同时必须支持好人，奖励好事，以严肃国家法纪，发扬正气，以克服官僚主义、命令主义作风和违法乱纪现象。
    在执行上述任务中，各级监察机关应各有重点。中央、大行政区和省（市）级监委应着重监督和检查工矿、交通、贸易等企业和基本建设工作，同时注意监督和检查县以上各级政府的财政税收、经济建设、民主建政等工作；专区以下监察机关应着重监督和检查县、区、乡的经济建设，同时注意对于选举运动和基层政权机关的监督和检查。各级业务部门监察机构应根据上述任务和本部门的中心工作，更具体地选择重点进行监督和检查。此外，在一九五三年中，要有计划地建立和健全各级监察机构、培养监察干部，并适当地发展人民监察通讯员、扩大人民监察通讯网。
    关于如何进行监察工作的问题，报告中指出应密切结合中心工作，抓住主要倾向，集中力量，有重点地、大张旗鼓地检查处理，取得经验，推动一般，并必须把自上而下的监督与自下而上的监督紧密结合起来。但是过去对发动群众自下而上的监督检查工作做的不够，因此，今后必须加强人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室、人民意见箱、人民询问处工作的领导，密切地联系群众，组织群众进行监督检查。在处理案件时，应当正确贯彻“教育与惩戒相结合”的原则，反对迁就姑息和单纯惩办的倾向。为了做好监察工作，各级监察机关必须要与各有关部门建立密切的联系制度，取得他们的帮助。同时要重视调查研究，善于总结经验，以便把监察工作提高一步。
    这次会议还对“中华人民共和国国家机关及其工作人员奖惩暂行条例（草案）”和“各级人民政府人民监察机关设置人民监察通讯员通则（草案）”两个文件作了详细研究。
    会议期间，中央人民政府朱德副主席和政务院邓小平副总理都到会讲话。朱副主席在讲话中指出：两年来，各级人民监察机关和监察工作人员做了不少工作，工作是有成绩的。目前，国家大规模的建设正在开始，人民监察工作的任务更加重大，它要严格监督检查国家建设计划的执行。朱副主席号召全国各级监察机关和监察工作人员，继续与官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的现象进行坚决的斗争，抓住重点，认真做好监督生产、监督财政的工作，努力学习苏联先进的监察工作经验，依靠群众，克服困难，完成监察工作的伟大任务。邓小平副总理在讲话中详细阐述了国家大规模建设的计划性和纪律性。他说：现在国家已进入计划建设的新阶段，各个部门、各个环节都有密切的联系，一个部门不能完成任务，就会影响到其他部门，因此，必须要加强各机关部门和工作人员的纪律性。人民监察机关必须在监察政府机关和公务人员是否履行其职责，以及巩固国家纪律方面，尽到自己的责任。如果监察机关和监察工作人员不能坚持原则、坚持立场，与各式各样的坏事坏人做斗争，那就是自己的失职，也就是自己违反了国家的纪律，这点是所有监察工作人员必须认识明白的。
    会议在刘景范副主任作总结后，由谭平山主任致闭幕词。他说：我们监察工作人员一九五三年的任务是光荣的，但也是艰巨的。在毛主席的英明领导和全国广大人民的支持下，我们有决心贯彻执行这次会议所决定的任务和方针，胜利完成国家交给我们的光荣任务。（新华社）
