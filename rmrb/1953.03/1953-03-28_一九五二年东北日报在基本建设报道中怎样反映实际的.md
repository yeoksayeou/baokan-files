    How the Northeast Daily Reflected Reality in its Capital Construction Reports in 1952

    With the basic completion of the recovery phase of Northeast China's industry, and the commencement of large-scale capital construction with key focuses, the Northeast Daily, from March 1952, prioritized capital construction in its industrial reporting. The Northeast Daily's reporting on capital construction in 1952 was relatively good in terms of aligning with and reflecting reality. This was mainly manifested in: more concentrated reporting on the promotion of advanced experiences, and more rapid and clear reporting on strengthening the responsibility system.

    Concentrated reporting is one form of strengthening the newspaper's motivational and guiding role. During the construction phase last year, the Northeast Daily seized on the crucial link of promoting advanced experiences and organized concentrated and continuous reporting, which played a certain guiding role in practical work. From April 16th to the end of December last year, the Northeast Daily published a total of more than 110 news articles, communications, editorials, experience introductions, character introductions, and instructions and decisions from leading organs related to advanced experiences, accounting for about a quarter of all capital construction reports. When reporting on these advanced experiences, the Northeast Daily also focused on promoting several key advanced experiences, such as the Su Changyou bricklaying method in civil engineering, the segmented parallel flow operation method in civil engineering construction management, the vacuum operation method in concrete pouring, the concrete pouring flow operation method, "pre-assembly" in installation engineering, the installation flow operation method, the parallel shaft operation method in new mine construction, and the Ma Wenzhi rapid drilling method in geological exploration. The concentrated promotion of these advanced experiences not only demonstrated the newspaper's profound purposefulness but also provided practical workers with something to follow, without being overwhelmed. The Northeast Daily consistently emphasized the idea of learning from the Soviet Union when reporting on these advanced experiences. In the reports on the parallel shaft operation method, the concrete vacuum operation method, the Ma Wenzhi rapid drilling method, and "pre-assembly," the Northeast Daily explicitly stated that it was necessary to learn from the Soviet Union, create an atmosphere of learning from the Soviet Union from cadres to workers, resolutely oppose conservative thinking, and oppose backward and outdated technical viewpoints, which cleared ideological obstacles for the promotion of advanced experiences.

    Another aspect of concentrated reporting, which is also very important, is that the timing must be rapid and the purpose must be clear. Especially for reports on capital construction, due to the specific stages and complexity of capital construction work, the newspaper's reports should be more suitable for this characteristic, promptly indicating its progress, and what should be advocated and what should be opposed. The Northeast Daily did well in this regard by strengthening the reporting of the responsibility system. After the universal commencement of various projects in Northeast China last June, due to the lack of experience of cadres in managing capital construction, the failure to establish and improve various necessary systems in a timely manner, the very poor sense of responsibility of technical personnel, weak political work, and the ideological confusion of construction workers gathered from various places, the phenomenon of no one being responsible and irresponsibility occurred universally at construction sites, resulting in slow project progress, poor project quality, and the failure to promote advanced experiences. After the former Northeast People's Government's Industry Department made a decision to reverse this chaotic situation, the Northeast Daily not only rapidly organized this report, continuously exposing and criticizing some typical phenomena of no one being responsible and irresponsibility; it also clearly pointed out that it was necessary to mobilize the masses to do this work well. To this end, the Northeast Daily also promptly introduced the experience of mobilizing the masses, as well as the new atmosphere that appeared in the later stages of the movement. This enabled the report to rapidly and clearly reflect the objective movement of the situation and the problems. The newspaper's editorial department also pointed out in summarizing the strengthened responsibility system report that to do a good job in reporting on capital construction, it is necessary to have a strong sense of time and foresight. This report lasted for more than a month from June 21st, enabling the masses to begin to realize that no one being responsible and irresponsibility was the current "extraordinary disaster."

    Although the Northeast Daily's 1952 capital construction reports were relatively concentrated, rapid, and clear in reflecting reality, there were still areas where it did not do enough in guiding practice. The newspaper pointed out in its work summary that although the 1952 reports on advanced experiences paid attention to the creative development of the Su Changyou bricklaying method and the Wang Sunci segmented parallel flow operation method, it lacked comprehensive, refined, and necessary organization for similar advanced experiences. For example, the advanced experiences of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's mixing plant, Fuxin's continuous pouring, the Hydropower Company's vacuum operation, and Fuxin's new curing method were not synthesized into a complete set of advanced concrete pouring experiences. At the same time, the promotion of advanced experiences in metal structure, installation engineering, mine construction, geological drilling, and mechanized and factory-style construction was also very insufficient. Secondly, the newspaper also pointed out in its summary that some reports on strengthening the responsibility system mostly stayed on the exposure of phenomena, without conducting profound criticism from an ideological point of view. Therefore, the solution to the problem was not very deep or thorough. Thirdly, the newspaper also focused on examining the shortcomings of insufficient publicity of the basic policies of capital construction. The summary pointed out that because the Party's guiding principles and policies for capital construction were not profoundly and specifically publicized and explained, the publicity could not fully penetrate people's hearts and mobilize the entire Party and the entire people to care for and support capital construction. After the newspaper published the editorial "It is Necessary to Shift the Leadership Focus of State-owned Industry to Capital Construction" on March 20th last year, it did not repeatedly elaborate and explain the fundamental ideas of putting capital construction in the primary position of economic construction, such as heavy industry first, construction at the fastest speed, the adoption of the most advanced technical standards, and why and how to implement the elevation of capital construction to the primary position, in conjunction with various reports. The reason for this shortcoming was that the reporting ideology did not clearly recognize that guiding the movement and publicizing policies should and could be combined. The summary of the Northeast Daily's 1952 capital construction reports played a significant role in promoting this year's capital construction preparation work. The newspaper not only continued to promote the advantages of last year's reports but also consciously and gradually overcame past shortcomings.

    Capital construction is also a new task for newspaper workers. Therefore, reports on capital construction still require everyone to work hard to explore and accumulate experience in the future. The experiences and lessons of the Northeast Daily's 1952 capital construction reports are worthy of reference for newspapers in various places.

### 一九五二年东北日报在基本建设报道中怎样反映实际的

    一九五二年东北日报在基本建设报道中怎样反映实际的
    随着东北工业恢复阶段在基本上的结束，和有重点的大规模基本建设的开始，自一九五二年三月起，东北日报即把基本建设作为工业报道的重点。东北日报对一九五二年基本建设的报道，在结合实际和反映实际方面作得较好。这主要表现在：推广先进经验的报道比较集中，加强责任制的报道比较迅速和明确。
    报道的集中是加强报纸的鼓动性、指导性的形式之一。东北日报在去年施工阶段中，就曾抓住推广先进经验这一决定环节，组织了集中连续的报道，对实际工作起了一定的指导作用。东北日报从去年四月十六日到十二月底，先后发表有关先进经验的新闻、通讯、言论、经验介绍、人物介绍、领导机关的指示决定共达一百一十余篇，约占全部基本建设报道的四分之一。东北日报在报道这些先进经验时，又集中地宣传了几项关键性的先进经验，如土木建筑方面的苏长有砌砖法、土木建筑施工管理上的分段平行流水作业法、混凝土浇灌方面的真空作业法、混凝土浇灌流水作业法、安装工程上的“预装配”、安装流水作业法、新式矿井建设中的竖井平行作业法、地质勘探方面的马文志快速钻探法等。对这些先进经验采用集中的宣传方法，不仅显示了报纸深刻的目的性，而且使实际工作者有所遵循，而不致眼花撩乱。东北日报在报道这些先进经验时，始终贯串了学习苏联的思想。在竖井平行作业法、混凝土真空作业法、马文志快速钻探法、“预装配”的报道中，东北日报曾明确地提出必须学习苏联，从干部到工人要造成学习苏联的风气，坚决反对保守思想，反对落后陈旧的技术观点，这就为推广先进经验扫除了思想障碍。
    报道集中的另一方面，也是很重要的一方面，就是时间必须迅速，目的必须明确。特别是对于基本建设的报道，由于基本建设工作具有特定的阶段性和复杂性，因而报纸的报道更应适合于这一特性，及时地指明其进程，以及应该提倡什么，反对什么。东北日报在这一方面，以加强责任制的报道作得较好。去年六月东北各工程普遍开工后，由于干部缺乏管理基本建设的经验，各种必要的制度没有及时建立和健全起来，技术人员的负责精神很差，政治工作薄弱，各处汇集来的建筑工人思想上很混乱等等原因，工地普遍发生无人负责和不负责任的现象，致使工程进度迟缓、工程质量低劣、先进经验不能推广。当原东北人民政府工业部作出关于扭转这种混乱局面的决定后，东北日报不仅迅速地组织了这一报道，连续地揭发和批评了一些典型的无人负责和不负责任的现象；并且明确地指出：必须发动群众作好这一工作。为此，东北日报还及时地介绍了发动群众的经验，以及在运动后期所出现的新气象。这就使报道迅速明确地反映了客观运动的情况和问题。该报编辑部在总结加强责任制报道中也指出，要作好基本建设的报道，就必须要有强烈的时间观念和预见性。这个报道从六月二十一日起一直持续了一个多月，使群众开始认识到：无人负责和不负责任是当前的“奇灾大祸”。
    东北日报一九五二年基本建设的报道，虽在反映实际方面作得比较集中、迅速和明确，但在指导实际方面，还有作得不够的地方。该报在工作总结中就曾指出，一九五二年对于先进经验的报道，虽然注意了苏长有砌砖法、王孙慈分段平行流水作业法的创造性的发展，但对于同类的先进经验却缺乏综合、提炼和必要的组织。如对鞍山钢铁公司的搅拌工厂、阜新的连续浇灌、水电公司的真空作业和阜新的新式养生法等，就没有综合为一整套的混凝土浇灌的先进经验。同时对推广金属结构、安装工程、矿井建设、地质钻探和机械化工厂化施工等方面的先进经验的宣传，也很不够。其次，该报在总结中还指出：有些加强责任制的报道，多停留在现象的揭发上，而没能从思想上进行深刻的批判。因而在解决问题上还不是很深很透。第三，该报并着重检查了对基本建设基本政策宣传得很不够的缺点。总结中指出说，因为没有深刻地具体宣传、解释党对基本建设的方针政策，就使得宣传不能完全深入人心，不能动员全党、全体人民都来关心和支援基本建设。该报在去年三月二十日发表了“必须把国营工业的领导重心转到基本建设方面”的社论后，对于把基本建设放在经济建设首要地位的几个根本思想，如重工业第一、以最快速度进行建设、要采用最先进的技术标准，以及为什么和如何贯彻把基本建设提到首要地位等等，都没有结合各种报道，反复加以阐述和说明。产生这一缺点的原因，是在报道思想上没有明确认识到指导运动和宣传政策是应该并且能够结合进行的。东北日报一九五二年基本建设报道的总结，对今年基本建设准备工作的报道起了重大的推动作用。该报不仅继续发扬了去年报道中的优点，并有意识地逐渐克服着过去的缺点。
    基本建设对于报纸工作者说来同样是一项新的工作。因此，对基本建设的报道还需要大家今后努力摸索经验积累经验。东北日报一九五二年基本建设报道中的经验和教训，是值得各地报纸参考的。
