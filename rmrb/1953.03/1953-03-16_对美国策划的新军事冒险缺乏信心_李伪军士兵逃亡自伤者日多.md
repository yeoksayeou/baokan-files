Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 14th: A dispatch from the Korean Central News Agency citing a frontline reporter states that soldiers and junior officers in the US-Syngman Rhee forces, especially the Syngman Rhee troops, lack confidence in the new military adventures being planned by Eisenhower, and war-weariness is widespread. Contradictions within the enemy forces are increasing daily.

The reporter points out: In order to sabotage the armistice negotiations and plan new military adventures, the enemy is creating a highly tense situation on the front lines. Since the beginning of this year, the enemy has redeployed and supplemented the troop strength and equipment of the enemy forces on the entire front line; since late February, they have removed obstacles along the entire line and begun to build mobile roads. At the same time, enemy transport ships and aircraft have transported large quantities of ammunition and military supplies to islands in the West Sea, centered on Ganghwa Island in Gyeonggi Bay, and to islands in the East Sea such as Lido and Sindo in Yongheung Bay. More enemy ships have appeared on the East and West seas. Centered on these ships, they are frequently conducting joint land-sea-air landing operations and anti-aircraft exercises. The enemy continues to send special agents to our front and rear areas and coastal zones to carry out sabotage and reconnaissance activities.

However, in the face of our army’s ironclad defenses, Eisenhower's plan for new military adventures has triggered a rapid increase in internal contradictions and war-weariness among the US and Syngman Rhee forces, leading to a three- to four-fold increase in the number of enemy soldiers deserting, feigning illness, and inflicting self-wounds recently. When thirty-six personnel from the US 40th Division were recently transferred to the front lines, twenty of them deserted en route. Among the Syngman Rhee troops, the situation is even worse. The increasing threat of starvation, excessive labor, and the constant coercion to serve as "special attack teams" for the US forces have led to continuous disturbances among officers and soldiers, and morale is declining. One division of the Syngman Rhee army has averaged more than two hundred desertions and self-inflicted wounds per month since the beginning of this year. Syngman Rhee soldiers are also surrendering to our army in large numbers; the number of those surrendering to our army in the first half of February was more than ten times higher than in January. For example, more than ten members of the "special attack team" of the 1st Battalion, 50th Regiment, 15th Division of the Syngman Rhee army first shot and killed their squad leader, who was threatening them with a pistol, and then surrendered to our army.

US soldiers are also expressing opposition to the new military adventures planned by Eisenhower. Soldiers from a reconnaissance company of the US 45th Division said:

"No US soldier supports Eisenhower's 'new offensive'... My comrades all unconditionally hope to resume armistice negotiations."

The reporter concludes by emphasizing: The fact that these contradictions and weaknesses within the enemy forces are deepening is a clear indication that the enemy's plan for new military adventures is suffering defeat from the very beginning.

    对美国策划的新军事冒险缺乏信心
    李伪军士兵逃亡自伤者日多
   【新华社平壤十四日电】朝鲜中央通讯社发表该社前线记者的一篇报道，说明美李匪军特别是李伪军士兵和下级军官对于艾森豪威尔策划中的新军事冒险缺乏信心，厌战情绪普遍，敌军内部矛盾正日益增加。
    记者指出：敌人为了破坏停战谈判，策划新的军事冒险，正在战线上造成高度紧张的状态。敌人从今年年初起对正面全线敌军的兵力和装备作了新的布置和补充；从二月下旬起在全线解除了障碍物，开始修筑机动道路。同时，敌运输船只和飞机向西海岸以京畿湾江华岛为中心的各岛屿，以及东海岸永兴湾的丽岛、薪岛等岛屿，输送了大量弹药和军需物资；更多的敌人舰船出现在东西海面上。敌人以这些舰船为中心，频繁地举行陆海空军相配合的登陆作战和对空作战的演习。敌人并对我前后方和海岸地带继续派遣特务，进行破坏和侦察活动。
    但是，在我军的钢铁防线面前，艾森豪威尔的新军事冒险计划却引起了美李匪军内部矛盾和厌战情绪的迅速增长，使最近敌军士兵逃亡、装病和自伤的人数增加到过去的三、四倍。美军第四十师所属人员三十六人最近被调往前线时，在路上就有二十人逃亡。在李承晚伪军中，更由于日益加甚的饥饿威胁、过重的劳役和经常被迫充当美军的“特攻队”，军官和士兵们不断起哄，士气越发低落。李伪军的一个师在今年年初，每月平均就有两百多人逃亡和自伤。伪军士兵并纷纷向我军投诚，在二月上半月向我军投诚的人数，比一月间增加了十倍以上。例如，伪军第十五师第五十联队第一大队的十多名“特攻队”，首先打死了用手枪威胁他们的小队长，然后向我军投诚。
    美军士兵也对艾森豪威尔策划中的新军事冒险表示反对。美军第四十五师一个搜索中队的士兵说：
    “没有一个美军士兵支持艾森豪威尔的‘新攻势’，……我的同伴们都无条件地希望恢复停战谈判。”
    记者最后强调说：敌军内部的这种矛盾和弱点正日益加深这个事实，确凿地表明：敌人的新军事冒险计划从第一步起就在遭受着失败。
