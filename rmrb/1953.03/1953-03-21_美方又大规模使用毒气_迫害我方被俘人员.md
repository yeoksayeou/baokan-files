Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th. According to the US POW camp headquarters, the US side used poison gas on a large scale on March 16th to attack 2,000 of our captured personnel on Longcao Island. In the same POW camp, a massacre occurred on March 7th in which the US side killed and wounded 65 POWs. At the same time, it is worth noting that the US side has recently fabricated a euphemism for poison gas—"non-toxic irritant"—and under the guise of this lie, is using chemical weapons on an increasingly large scale to attack our captured personnel. However, even American news agencies revealed at the beginning of last month that prisoners of war were forced to prepare to quickly wash off the "irritant" sprayed on their bodies with soapy water, which shows that the so-called "irritant" may well be a corrosive toxic liquid that adheres to the human body. Personnel from our negotiating delegation here pointed out that the US side must bear full responsibility for the immediate or chronic damage caused by such chemical weapons among our captured personnel.

    美方又大规模使用毒气
    迫害我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城二十日电】据美方战俘营司令部宣布：美方十六日在龙草岛大规模使用毒气攻击两千名我方被俘人员。在同一个战俘营中，三月七日曾发生美方杀死打伤战俘六十五名的大屠杀。同时，值得注意的是：美方最近捏造出一个毒气的代名词——“无毒刺激物”，并且在这个谎言的掩饰下，愈来愈大规模地用化学武器进攻我方被俘人员。但是连美国通讯社也曾在上月初透露：战俘曾被迫准备用肥皂水迅速洗去喷射在身上的“刺激物”，这说明所谓“刺激物”完全可能是粘附人体的?烂性毒液。此间我方谈判代表团人士指出，对于这种化学武器在我方被俘人员中间造成的立即的或慢性的损害，美方必须担负全部责任。
