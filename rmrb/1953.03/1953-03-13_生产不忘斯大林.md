    Production Forgets Not Stalin
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Lin Yao Tian Zhuang
    The day after the sad news of Comrade Stalin's death reached Wuhan, in a passenger car workshop of the Jiang'an Railway Factory, the birthplace of the "February 7th" Great Strike, Wen Liang, a 55-year-old veteran worker from the "February 7th" strike, tearfully asked his young apprentice Zhang Songwang to bring a brush dipped in white paint and wrote seven large characters on his tool—a jack: "Production Forgets Not Stalin." He said to his apprentice with grief: "We have struggled for so many years, from the 'February 7th' Great Strike until now, and we have finally been able to live such a good life today. This is inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin. We have nothing else to express our commemoration of him, only to write his name, always think of him, and do a good job in production to commemorate him."
    The phrase "Production Forgets Not Stalin" truly represents the feelings of more than 1,700 workers in the entire Jiang'an Railway Factory. On the afternoon of March 6, when the sad news of Comrade Stalin's death came, all the workers were stunned and grieved, unable to speak. After worker Chen Changlun returned home from work, he only ate two mouthfuls of rice and sat there blankly. He thought of his past suffering and his good life today, and he also thought of Stalin's help to China. The more he thought about it, the sadder he became, and he even bought some wine to drink. But he quickly thought: What's the use of being so sad for a long time? Is crying and drinking like this a way to commemorate Stalin? At this time, the call of Factory Director Jiang to "turn grief into strength" immediately came to his mind. He knew that to mourn Stalin with practical actions, he should first do a good job in production. So he wiped away his tears, immediately put on his clothes, and rushed to the factory to work the night shift. On this night, many workers found the correct way to "turn grief into strength" in such a sad mood—work hard to produce.
    On March 7, many new atmospheres appeared in production in various workshops. The workers in the locomotive workshop automatically inserted white triangular flags on their lathes, with the words: "To commemorate Comrade Stalin, we must strive to complete the production tasks for March." "To mourn Comrade Stalin, further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union." People began to take action according to these vows. This workshop has already made preliminary achievements in promoting the Soviet advanced working method—operating according to instruction charts. They once repaired a locomotive in nineteen days. Now, they have proposed a plan to further promote operation according to instruction charts. The large axle group is prepared to change from calculating by day to calculating by the hour. In the mechanical workshop, Xu Denggui, an old lathe worker who has been working for more than 20 years, suffered from an eye disease a few days ago, and the doctor asked him to take three days off to recuperate. However, on the first day he began to rest, he heard the news of Comrade Stalin's death, and he was no longer willing to rest. Early in the morning of March 7, his eyes were not yet healed, so he rushed to the factory to work. In the passenger car workshop, Communist Party members and members of the Communist Youth League are discussing how to mourn Comrade Stalin with practical actions to improve production. They proposed: In addition to completing the task of repairing eight and a half passenger cars in March, they will also repair one and a half passenger cars in excess, and use the practical action of overfulfilling the production task to mourn Comrade Stalin. Now, nine dilapidated passenger cars have been transported to the construction site, and the workers' extremely meaningful labor has begun.
      "Production Forgets Not Stalin" has become the action slogan and source of unlimited power for the workers of the Jiang'an Railway Factory, and great miracles will appear under the encouragement of this power.

    生产不忘斯大林
    新华社记者　林耀　田庄
    斯大林同志逝世的不幸消息传到武汉市的第二天，在“二七”大罢工发源地的江岸铁路工厂的一个客车工场里，五十五岁的“二七”老工人文良，含着泪水叫他年青的徒弟张松旺拿来一支沾着白漆的毛笔，在他的工具——千斤顶上写了七个大字：“生产不忘斯大林”。他沉痛地对他的徒弟说：“从‘二七’大罢工斗争到现在，斗争了多少年，我们好容易才能过今天这样的好日子。这是和苏联、和斯大林同志的帮助分不开的。我们没有别的东西来表达对他的纪念，只有写上他的名字，时刻想着他，搞好生产来纪念他。”
    “生产不忘斯大林”这句话的确代表了整个江岸铁路工厂一千七百多职工的心情。三月六日下午，当斯大林同志逝世的不幸消息传来的时候，所有的工人都惊愕、悲痛得说不出话来。工人陈长伦下班回家后，只吃了两口饭就呆呆地坐着，他想起了自己过去的苦日子和今天的好生活，又想起了斯大林对中国的帮助，他越想越难过，甚至买了一些酒来喝。但是他很快地想到：长久这样悲痛下去有什么用呢？这样流泪、喝酒难道是纪念斯大林的办法吗？这时，江厂长提出的“化悲痛为力量”的号召，立刻涌现到他的脑子里来。他知道，要用实际行动来追悼斯大林，首先就应该搞好生产。于是他把眼泪擦干，马上披起衣服赶到工厂去值夜班。在这一天的夜里，许多工人都在这样的悲痛心情中，找到了“化悲痛为力量”的正确方法——努力生产。
    三月七日，各车间出现了许多生产上的新气象。机车工场的工人们自动在自己的车床上插上了白色的三角旗，旗子上写着：“纪念斯大林同志，我们要努力完成三月份的生产任务。”“悼念斯大林同志，进一步学好苏联先进经验。”人们按照这些誓言开始行动了起来。这个车间过去在推行苏联先进工作方法——按指示图表作业，已经有了初步成绩，他们曾经以十九天的时间修出过一辆机车，现在，他们又提出了进一步推行按指示图表作业的计划。大轴组已准备由按日计算改为按小时来计算了。在机械工场里，一个做了二十多年工的老车工徐登贵，前几天害了眼病，医生要他请三天假休养，但是，当他开始休息的第一天就听到了斯大林同志逝世的消息，他再也不愿意休息了。三月七日一早，他的眼睛还没有好，就赶来工厂上班。在客车工场里，共产党员、青年团员正在讨论如何以搞好生产的实际行动来悼念斯大林同志。他们提出：除完成三月份修理出八辆半客车的任务外，还要超额修理好一辆半客车，以超额完成生产任务的实际行动来悼念斯大林同志。现在，九辆残破的客车已运到工地，工人们极有意义的劳动已经开始了。
      “生产不忘斯大林”已成为江岸铁路工厂工人们的行动口号和无限力量的源泉，伟大的奇迹将在这个力量的鼓舞下出现。
