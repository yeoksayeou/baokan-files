Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Soviet workers are displaying high creativity and enthusiasm, accelerating the progress of Stalin's communist construction projects.

    The scale of work at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station is expanding daily. The amount of materials transported to the construction site in the first two months of this year is more than five times that of last summer. Excavator operators are digging 300,000 cubic meters of earth per month in the severe cold. Earthwork is also being accelerated at the power plant foundation and navigation system construction sites. The work group led by advanced worker Krementiev began working according to the March plan in the last week of February. They overfulfilled the quota by more than 10,000 cubic meters of excavation and loading, reducing the time of an excavation cycle from the prescribed 45 seconds to 20 or 22 seconds. Atop the 1,500-meter-long waterproof dam extending into the Volga River bed, a sand and soil wall is being built to prevent spring floods from encroaching on the foundation pit.

    Construction workers at the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station are working hard to prepare for flood prevention. Dredge operators continued to build the waterproof dam even at minus 20 degrees Celsius, without reducing the quality of their work. To lower the groundwater level, a powerful installation composed of hundreds of turbine pumps has been installed at the foundation pit enclosure, and a main water pipe several kilometers long has been built.

    The builders of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station on the Dnieper River have put forward a great guarantee to complete all projects one year ahead of schedule. Since the beginning of February, the project has entered a new stage—preparing to pour concrete for the main buildings. Before this, workers completed the foundation pit excavation of the locks, power plant, and spillway and the construction of the waterproof dam in just nine months. The accumulated water in the lock foundation pit has been drained, and filtration equipment has been installed to lower the groundwater level. Machines to lower the groundwater level have also been installed around the foundation pits of the power plant and spillway. Great success has been achieved in the waterproof dam project protecting the foundation pits, and the construction scale of the entire North Crimean Canal is also constantly expanding. Equipment, machinery, and timber are continuously transported day and night from Yankoy city to the construction site by rail. Many excavator operators are completing two to three times their daily quotas.

    The greatest recent victory for the builders of the Turkmen Main Canal was the completion of the eight-kilometer-long circular canal project, and the excavation of the canal body of the Grand Canal began on February 28. This is the official start of the main offensive towards the Kara-Kum Desert. Now, the builders are continuing their socialist competition with the builders of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station. Many excavator operators regularly complete two to two and a half times their quotas.

    In the area of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, which was opened to navigation last year, the main construction site has been advanced to the lower reaches of the Don River. Excavators and cranes have successively begun operating at the new hydraulic bases to build dikes, power plants, and locks to utilize the water of the Don River to further develop shipping, power, agriculture, and fisheries. At present, automatic concrete mixing plants, repair factories, other auxiliary enterprises, and railway branch lines are being built at an accelerated pace. A large port is being built at the confluence of the Seversky Donets River, the Donets River, and the Don River. In terms of irrigation systems, new pumping stations are being built in the area north of the lower Don branch canal and the Azov branch canal in the southeastern Don region, and the Bagayevsk Canal and the Sadkovsk Canal are being excavated.

    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Soviet civil aircraft are being dispatched in large numbers to help collective farms in southern Soviet Union with spring plowing. According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 19th: In the fields of Moldova, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan Republics, and in the North Caucasus, Odessa, Nikolaev and other states, airplanes have been fertilizing crops in the past few days. In the past two weeks, Azerbaijan Republic has used airplanes to fertilize land covering an area of 1,600 hectares (equivalent to 24,000 mu). The North Ossetian Autonomous Republic used airplanes to spread mineral fertilizers, fertilizing 15,000 hectares (equivalent to 225,000 mu) of land. The workload undertaken by agricultural aircraft in the Georgian Republic this year will increase by 20 percent compared to last year. Facts have proved that using airplanes to fertilize can help increase the yield per unit area of crops.

    据新华社讯：苏联工人发挥高度创造性和积极性，加速进行斯大林共产主义建设工程。
    古比雪夫水电站的工作规模正在一天天扩大。今年头两个月运往工地上的物资就相当于去年夏天的五倍以上。挖掘机操使者们在严寒的天气里每月挖土三十万公方。在电力厂基坑和通航系统工地上，土方工程也在加速进行。以先进工人克列缅捷夫为首的工作组，在二月份最后一个星期就开始按三月份的计划工作了。他们超过定额完成了一万多土方的挖掘和装车工作，把一个挖掘周期的时间从规定的四十五秒减到二十或二十二秒。延伸在伏尔加河河床上的长达一千五百公尺的拒水堰顶上，正建造一道沙土墙，以防止春汛侵袭基坑。
    斯大林格勒水电站的建筑工人正努力为防汛作好准备工作。吸泥机操使者甚至在摄氏零下二十度时还继续砌筑拒水堰，而且还不减低工作质量。为了降低地下水水位，在基坑围墙处已安装了一套由数百具透平抽水机组成的效力强大的装置，并且建筑了一条长达几公里的总水管。
    第聂伯河畔卡霍夫卡水电站的建筑者们已提出了一个伟大的保证，要提前一年完成全部的工程。自二月初以来这个工程已进入新阶段——为主要建筑物浇灌混凝土进行准备。在这以前，工人们在短短的九个月中完成了水闸、电力厂和放水堰的基坑挖掘工作及拒水堰的修筑工程。水闸基坑的积水已经抽干，并安装了滤水设备来降低地下水水位。电力厂和放水堰的基坑周围也装上了降低地下水水位的机器，保护基坑的拒水堰工程已获得巨大成就，北克里米亚运河全线的建筑规模也在不断扩大。从阳科伊城到工地的铁路上日夜不停地运来大批设备、机器和木材。许多挖掘机操使者每天都完成两三倍的定额。
    土库曼大运河的建筑者最近取得的最伟大的胜利，是完成了长达八公里的环形渠工程，在二月二十八日开始了大运河河身的开凿工作。这是向卡拉·库姆沙漠进行的主要攻势的正式开始。现在，建筑者正在继续与斯大林格勒水电站建筑者展开社会主义竞赛。许多挖掘机操使者经常完成两倍到两倍半定额。
    在去年通航的列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河地区，主要建筑工地已推进到顿河下游。挖掘机、起重机已陆续在新水力据点上运转，以便建设堤坝、动力厂和水闸，利用顿河的水来进一步发展航运、动力、农业和渔业。目前自动混凝土搅拌厂、修理工厂、其他辅助企业和铁路支线正在加紧修筑。塞维尔河、顿尼兹河与顿河合流处正在建筑大港口。在灌溉系统方面，顿河东南部下顿河支渠和亚速支渠以北的地方正在建造新的抽水站，并开凿巴加耶夫斯克运河和萨德科夫斯克运河。
    【新华社二十三日讯】苏联民用飞机正大批出动，在苏联南部帮助集体农庄进行春耕工作。据塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：在摩尔达维亚、阿塞拜疆和乌兹别克共和国，在北高加索、敖德萨、尼科拉耶夫等州的田地上空，这几天来常有飞机给农作物施肥。阿塞拜疆共和国在过去两星期中用飞机施肥的土地面积已达一千六百公顷（合二万四千市亩）。北奥塞梯自治共和国用飞机撒下矿物肥料，给一万五千公顷（合二十二万五千市亩）土地施肥。格鲁吉亚共和国今年用农业飞机担负的工作量将比去年增加百分之二十。事实证明：用飞机施肥可以帮助农作物单位面积产量的提高。
