    We are Building Socialism Under the Banner of Lenin and Stalin
    Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia
    Editor's Note: This is Comrade Gottwald's last posthumous work, published in the Soviet "Pravda" on March 11. We are translating and publishing it as a memorial to this great leader of the Czechoslovak people and outstanding fighter of the international workers' movement.
    When our delegation attending the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union spoke with Comrade Stalin himself, we were all filled with infinite joy at Stalin's vigor and energy. After our delegation returned home and spoke of this, all the people of Czechoslovakia shared our joy. Now, as we bid farewell to our dear and infinitely beloved Comrade Stalin, this fills us with exceptionally heavy grief.
    Comrade Stalin's death is an irreparable loss not only for the peoples of the Soviet Union, but also for the peoples of all People's Democratic countries and all working people in capitalist countries. But Stalin's cause, like Lenin's cause, is immortal.
    It was Stalin and Lenin who together created the Bolshevik Party, the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is a necessary prerequisite for the proletariat to defeat the rule of the exploiters.
    It was Stalin and Lenin who together led the Great October Socialist Revolution, which has worldwide historical significance. This revolution broke through the system of world capitalism and imperialism for the first time in history, and liberated the working people who occupied one-sixth of the world's land from the shackles of capitalism.
    It was Stalin and Lenin who, in the difficult days of the domestic war and imperialist armed intervention, crushed the armies of the counter-revolutionaries and armed interventionists, thereby consolidating the victory of the October Revolution of the working people.
    After Lenin's death, it was Stalin who resolutely led the Party and the state, fought a decisive battle with the Trotsky-Bukharin traitors, thereby ensuring the socialist construction of the Soviet Union.
    It was Stalin who was the initiator of the great industrialization of the Soviet state and the large-scale transition of millions of farmers to the path of collectivization. He transformed an economically backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country with the most modern industry and large-scale agriculture, a strong socialist power.
    It was Stalin who, during the Great Patriotic War, organized the defense against the insidious Hitler aggressors and inflicted a devastating defeat on them. Under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet army saved mankind from fascist enslavement, liberated the people of many countries in Europe and Asia, and made it possible for them to establish a new, free life without bosses and exploiters.
    Under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet Union healed the terrible wounds of war in an unprecedentedly short period of time, became economically and politically stronger than ever before, and launched the construction of communism.
    It was Stalin who led the powerful camp of socialist builders with 800 million people. Stalin's name is the banner of all people of goodwill and all who fight for peace and a happy life.
    It was Stalin who, in his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR", depicted the magnificent prospect of transitioning to communism and determined the various conditions for this transition.
    Stalin's cause has worldwide historical significance, because this cause relies on billions of people around the world, because this cause embodies the future of happiness for all mankind. Therefore, Stalin's cause is immortal.
    Stalin's cause, Stalin's name will also be recorded in the history of our country, the Czechoslovak people, for generations to come: this has special reasons for us.
    As early as before the First World War, Stalin was the first statesman in the world to advocate fighting for the right of self-determination for the Czechoslovak nation, even to the point of breaking with the Habsburg dynasty. At that time, the Czech bourgeoisie did not even think about breaking with Vienna.
    The establishment of the Czechoslovak state is closely related to the Great October Socialist Revolution. This revolution put forward the slogan of national self-determination, put this slogan into practice in reality, and thereby accelerated the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Everyone knows that Stalin brilliantly participated in formulating the national policy of the young Soviet republic.
    In our most difficult period, in the days of Munich, when everyone abandoned our republic, when our own ruling class betrayed and sold the country to Hitler, Stalin stood faithfully and resolutely shoulder-to-shoulder with our republic. Stalin personally suggested giving Czechoslovakia military assistance to fight against the Hitler aggressors. The Czechoslovak bourgeoisie shamefully rejected this assistance. They preferred to be occupied by Hitler and plunged our people into the most tragic state of enslavement.
    But Stalin knew that the Czechoslovak bourgeoisie was not the Czechoslovak people. In the course of the Second World War, while the Soviet Union was engaged in bloody fighting, Stalin announced that the purpose of the Soviet army was not only to drive the aggressors out of the Soviet Union, but also to liberate other nations, including the Czechoslovak people, from Hitler's shackles. The Soviet army carried out Stalin's orders and liberated Czechoslovakia on the memorable day of May 9, 1945.
    After the Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia, Stalin did not stop his fatherly concern for our republic. When a severe crop failure in 1947-48 threatened our country with famine, Stalin personally issued an order to have the Soviet Union supply us with 600,000 tons of grain. When the hostile policies of capitalist countries caused various difficulties in our country, Stalin helped us and gave us a large number of Soviet products, raw materials and machines. Stalin, with his personal advice, helped us to rebuild our national economy along a new, socialist track, sent us first-rate Soviet experts, and generously allowed us to master Soviet experience so that we could manufacture new machines and lathes that had never been produced before. In short, with every step forward we felt Stalin's caring and assisting hand.
    Therefore, our people, the Czechoslovak people, feel particularly heavy and extraordinarily grieved over the loss of our most precious person, teacher and father.
    However, Comrade Stalin often taught us that under no circumstances should we be discouraged or lose our minds. Therefore, we are implementing Stalin's legacy. We must hold the banner of Lenin and Stalin even higher, and resolutely advance along the path that Stalin pointed out to us, along the path of building socialism in our country, and along the path of the struggle to safeguard and consolidate peace.
    To this end, it is necessary to make the ranks of our beloved Czechoslovak Communist Party even more united, to unite it more firmly around the Central Committee, to defend its unity and strength more resolutely, and to maintain and consolidate its ties with the broad masses of working people in urban and rural areas more resolutely. Stalin taught us that the Party is everything; overcoming all obstacles and misfortunes depends on the Party's unity and purposefulness. We must implement Stalin's legacy, just as the Soviet people are doing now.
    Likewise, it is necessary to unite more closely around the government of the National Front. Our Party and our People's Democratic government have one and only one goal, which is to seek the welfare of the working people in urban and rural areas. The more our Party and government are vigorously supported by the people, and the more resolutely each of us, without exception, abides by Party discipline, labor discipline and state discipline, the more successfully this task will be accomplished. Stalin taught us that the consolidation of the state is of great significance in the cause of socialist construction. Stalin taught us how important the unity of the government and the people is. In this regard, the Soviet government and the Soviet people should be our example.
    In these days, every worker in Czechoslovakia should recognize that it is necessary to further consolidate our alliance with the Soviet Union, with our liberator. Building socialism, guaranteeing our national freedom and national independence, and defending peace—all of this would be inconceivable without a consolidated alliance with the powerful Soviet Union. The people of our country understand this very well. Therefore, in these sad days, they are showing a strong unity with the Soviet Union, with the Soviet people and their party—the Party of Lenin and Stalin.
    It is necessary to raise vigilance against all kinds of enemies. Domestic reactionaries, instigated by reactionary beasts abroad, are hiding among us. They think that the time for their schadenfreude has come. Our people, united around the Party and the government and united with the friendly Soviet Union, give the reactionary dogs the corresponding answer: press them firmly to the ground, step over them, and move further towards their great goal.
    We must not forget to carry out our constructive tasks for a moment. On the contrary, the final year of the Five-Year Plan should ensure that the plans in all aspects of industry, agriculture, transportation, and domestic and foreign trade are completed even better. Stalin taught us to implement the basic economic law of socialism, which is to improve the material and cultural welfare of the working people, which is only possible if we produce better and cheaper and learn to use modern technology better. Recalling Stalin, we must not only remember Stalin's conclusion, but also put it into practice in all areas of our economic, political and cultural life.
    In these days, we are seeing some new acts of inciting war and various provocations. We will not allow these acts to distract us from our constructive labor. We will not forget that an important part of Stalin's legacy lies in the fact that the people of all countries must take on the cause of fighting against new wars and defending peace. As Comrade Stalin said, if the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace, peace can be maintained. For us, this means exposing the warmongers and their agents every day. To do our best to prevent the people from believing in these demons and to prevent their evil activities everywhere. For us, the struggle for peace also means faithfully and accurately carrying out our construction tasks and comprehensively caring for the country's defense forces, and caring for the high combat spirit, high political and moral cultivation of our armed forces.
    Comrade Stalin was the closest comrade-in-arms of the great Lenin and the brilliant successor to Lenin's cause. Stalin and Lenin together created a strong and well-trained Communist Party that led the Soviet people from victory to victory and became a model and inexhaustible source of experience for communist and workers' parties around the world. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, created and educated by Lenin and Stalin, is the leading force of the Soviet people and is the guarantee of further success for the Soviet people in the construction of communism. The communist and workers' parties of various people's democratic countries and capitalist countries will learn more and better the art of defeating the enemy and winning victory from the example of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the struggle for the cause of the working people.
    Comrade Stalin called the various people's democratic countries the new "shock troops" of the world revolution and the workers' movement. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working people of Czechoslovakia, together with other people's democratic countries, must contribute all their strength so as not to fail Stalin's great trust, and under the leadership of the Soviet people, march towards new victories in the cause of socialism and peace, the cause of Lenin and Stalin.
    In front of the mausoleum in Moscow, in front of the two greatest geniuses of mankind, we, on behalf of the Czechoslovak people, solemnly swear that we will go to the end along the path they pointed out to us. We will reach socialism under the banner of Lenin and Stalin. (Translated by Wang Yingxiu, Zhang Zhenya, and Liu Jing from the March 11, 1953 "Pravda") (Attached picture)

专栏：

    我们在列宁—斯大林旗帜下建设社会主义
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席　哥特瓦尔德
    编者按：这是哥特瓦尔德同志发表在三月十一日苏联“真理报”上的最后一篇遗著，特译出发表，作为对这位捷克斯洛伐克人民的伟大领袖和国际工人运动的卓越战士的纪念。
    当我们出席苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的代表团和斯大林同志本人谈话的时候，我们全体都因斯大林的健爽和精力饱满而感到无限欣慰。在我们代表团回国后，谈到这点时，捷克斯洛伐克的全体人民也都和我们一起为此而欣慰。现在，当我们最后送别我们的亲爱的、无限敬爱的斯大林同志时，这就使我们感到异常沉重的悲痛。
    斯大林同志的逝世，不仅是苏联各族人民、而且也是各人民民主国家的人民以及资本主义各国全体劳动人民的无可弥补的损失。但是斯大林的事业正如列宁的事业一样，是永垂不朽的。
    正是斯大林和列宁一起缔造了布尔什维克党，光荣的苏联共产党，这个党乃是无产阶级战胜剥削者统治的必要前提。
    正是斯大林和列宁一起领导了具有全世界历史意义的伟大十月社会主义革命，这个革命第一次在历史上突破了世界资本主义和帝国主义的体系，把占世界六分之一土地的劳动人民由资本主义的桎梏下解放出来。
    正是斯大林和列宁一起，在国内战争和帝国主义武装干涉的艰难时日中，粉碎了反革命分子和武装干涉者的军队，从而巩固了劳动人民的十月革命的胜利。
    在列宁死后，正是斯大林坚毅地领导了党和国家，与托洛茨基—布哈林变节分子们进行了决战，从而保证了苏联的社会主义建设。
    正是斯大林是苏维埃国家伟大工业化和千百万农民大规模地过渡到集体化道路的发起者，他把一个经济上落后的农业国家改造成具有最现代化工业和大规模农业的强大工业国家，一个社会主义的强国。
    正是斯大林在伟大卫国战争期中，组织了对阴险的希特勒侵略分子们的防御，并使他们遭到毁灭性的失败。在斯大林的领导下，苏联军队把人类由法西斯奴役下拯救出来，解放了欧洲和亚洲许多国家的人民，使他们有可能建立没有老板和剥削者的、新的自由的生活。
    在斯大林的领导下，苏联在空前短暂的时期中，医好了战争的可怕创伤，在经济和政治上变得比以前任何时期都更为强大，并展开了共产主义的建设。
    正是斯大林领导了强大的拥有八亿人口的社会主义建设者的阵营。斯大林的名字是所有善良意志的人们和所有为和平和幸福生活而斗争的人们的旗帜。
    正是斯大林在他的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，描绘了过渡到共产主义的宏伟远景，确定了这一过渡的各种条件。
    斯大林的事业具有全世界历史性的意义，因为这个事业依靠着全世界亿万群众，因为这个事业体现了全人类幸福的未来。所以，斯大林的事业是不朽的。
    斯大林的事业，斯大林的名字也将世世代代地载入我国、捷克斯洛伐克人民的史册中：这对我们还有着特殊的原因。
    斯大林早在第一次世界大战以前，便是世界上主张争取捷克斯洛伐克民族自决权，直到与哈布斯堡王朝决裂的第一个政治家。当时捷克的资产阶级连想也没有想到和维也纳决裂的事。
    捷克斯洛伐克国家的建立和伟大的十月社会主义革命密切联系着。这个革命提出了民族自决权的口号，在实际上实行了这一口号，并以此加速了奥匈帝国的瓦解。大家知道，斯大林曾卓越地参加制订了年轻的苏维埃共和国的民族政策。
    在我们的最艰难的时期中，在慕尼黑的日子里，当所有的人都抛弃了我们的共和国，当我们本国的统治阶级变了节并把国家出卖给希特勒的时候，斯大林忠实地和坚决地与我们的共和国肩并肩地站在一起。斯大林曾亲自建议给捷克斯洛伐克以军事援助来反对希特勒侵略分子。捷克斯洛伐克资产阶级可耻地拒绝了这个援助，他们宁愿被希特勒占领，并使我国人民陷入最悲惨的奴役境地。
    但是斯大林知道捷克斯洛伐克资产阶级并不是捷克斯洛伐克的人民。在第二次世界大战的进程中，在苏联进行浴血苦战的时候，斯大林曾宣布苏联军队的目的不仅是要把侵略者逐出苏联，而且也要把其他民族，其中包括捷克斯洛伐克人民，从希特勒的桎梏下解放出来。苏联军队执行了斯大林的手令，于一九四五年五月九日这个值得纪念的日子，解放了捷克斯洛伐克。
    在苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克以后，斯大林并没有停止对我们共和国的父亲般的关怀。当一九四七——四八年由于严重的歉收使我国面临饥荒的威胁时，斯大林曾亲自发布命令，让苏联供给我们六十万吨谷物。当资本主义国家的敌对政策在我们国家中引起了各种困难时，斯大林曾帮助我们，给我们以大量的苏联产品、原料和机器。斯大林以他私人的忠告，帮助我们把我国的国民经济改建向新的、社会主义的轨道，为我们派遣头等的苏联专家，慷慨地让我们掌握苏联经验，以使我们能制造以前所没有生产过的新的机器和车床。总之，我们每前进一步，都感到了斯大林的关怀的援助的手。
    因此，我国人民，捷克斯洛伐克人民，对于失去了我们最珍贵的人、导师和父亲，感到特别沉重和异常悲痛。
    然而斯大林同志经常教导我们，无论在任何情况之下，都不应当沮丧，都不应当失掉理智。因此，我们执行斯大林的遗训，要更高地举着列宁—斯大林的旗帜，并坚决沿着斯大林所指给我们的道路、沿着在我国建设社会主义的道路、沿着维护和巩固和平的斗争道路前进。
    为此就必须使我们亲爱的捷克斯洛伐克共产党的队伍团结得更紧密，使它更坚固地团结在中央委员会的周围，更坚决地保卫它的统一和牢固，更坚决地保持和巩固它与城乡广大劳动人民的联系。斯大林教导过我们：党就是一切；克服一切阻碍和不幸都系于党的团结一致和目的性。我们一定要执行斯大林的这些遗训，正像苏联人民现在所正在做的一样。
    同样必须更加紧密地团结在民族阵线的政府周围。我们的党和我们的人民民主政府有一个唯一的目的，这就是为城乡劳动人民谋福利。我们的党和政府愈是得到人民的大力支持，我们每个人愈是都毫无例外地坚决遵守党的纪律、劳动纪律和国家纪律，那么这个任务也就完成得更加成功。斯大林曾教导我们说，国家的巩固性在社会主义建设事业中具有重大的意义。斯大林曾教导我们，政府和人民的团结一致是如何重要。在这方面，苏联政府和苏联人民应该是我们的榜样。
    在这些日子里，捷克斯洛伐克的每一个劳动者都应该认识到必须更加巩固我们与苏联、与我们的解放者的联盟。建设社会主义、保证我们的民族自由和国家独立、保卫和平——所有这一切如果没有与强大的苏联的巩固联盟，就是不可思议的。我国人民很了解这一点，因此在这些悲痛的日子里，他们表现出与苏联、与苏联人民及其政党——列宁斯大林的党的坚强的团结。
    必须提高对各种敌人的警惕性。为国外反动的野兽所鼓动的国内反动分子隐藏在我们之间。他们认为，适合于他们的幸灾乐祸的时候已经来到了。我国人民团结在党和政府周围并和友好的苏联团结在
    一起，给与反动的走狗们以相应的回答：把他们紧压在地上，踏过他们并向自己伟大的目标进一步前进。
    我们一刻也不应当忘记执行我们的建设性任务。相反，五年计划最后一年，在工业、农业、运输、国内外贸易各方面的计划都应当保证完成得更好。斯大林教导我们，要执行社会主义的基本经济法则，也就是要改善劳动人民的物质和文化的福利，只有在我们更好地和便宜地生产和学会更好地使用现代技术的条件下，才是可能的。想起斯大林来，我们不仅要记住斯大林的这个结论，而且要把它在我们经济、政治和文化生活的一切领域中付诸实现。
    在这些日子里，我们亲眼看见一些新的煽动战争的行为和各种挑拨。我们不允许这些行为使我们离开自己的建设性的劳动，我们不会忘记，斯大林的遗训的重要部分就是在于，各国人民要担当起反对新战争和保卫和平的斗争事业。正像斯大林同志所说，如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，和平就能保持。对我们来说，这意味着每天都要揭穿战争贩子及其代理人。要尽力使人民不相信这些恶魔，并处处阻止他们的罪恶活动。争取和平的斗争，对我们来说，还意味着忠实地和确切地执行我们的建设任务和全面关怀国家的防御力量，关怀我们武装力量的高度战斗精神、高度的政治的和道义的修养。
    斯大林同志是伟大列宁最亲近的战友，是列宁事业的天才继承者。斯大林和列宁在一起，缔造了领导苏联人民从胜利到胜利并成为全世界共产党与工人党的榜样和取之不尽的经验泉源的强大的受过锻炼的共产党。为列宁和斯大林所创建和教育的苏联共产党，是苏联人民的领导力量，是苏联人民在共产主义建设中获致进一步成功的保证。各人民民主国家和资本主义国家的共产党与工人党，在为劳动人民事业的斗争中，从苏联共产党的范例，将更多和更好地学习到打击敌人和获得胜利的艺术。
    斯大林同志把各人民民主国家称为世界革命和工人运动的新“突击队”。捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民在共产党的领导下，与其他各人民民主国家一起，
    一定要贡献出自己的全部力量以不负于斯大林的伟大信任，并在苏联人民的领导下走向社会主义和和平事业、列宁和斯大林事业的新胜利。
    在莫斯科的陵墓前面，在人类的最伟大的两位天才的面前，我们代表捷克斯洛伐克人民，庄严地宣誓，我们将沿着他们指给我们的道路走到底。我们要在列宁—斯大林的旗帜下，走到社会主义。（王英秀、张振亚、刘竞译自一九五三年三月十一日“真理报”）（附图片）
