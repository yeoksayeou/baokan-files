Editor's Note: The Southwest District Marriage Law Implementation Committee's timely correction of certain cadres' and masses' erroneous views on the current Marriage Law implementation campaign and its stipulation of specific measures for carrying out the campaign are entirely necessary and correct. In the past stage and even at present, many regions across the country have experienced similar chaotic situations in the implementation of the Marriage Law as in the Southwest District. It is therefore imperative to clearly explain the policies to the masses, especially to the cadres, reverse their unhealthy emotions, and carry out the campaign to the end. Regions that are temporarily unable to fully launch the campaign due to insufficient manpower may also refer to the methods of the Southwest District, proceeding in batches and focusing on key areas. It is particularly important to combine the Marriage Law implementation campaign with production. All localities should arrange manpower and work according to local conditions, striving to ensure that the Marriage Law implementation campaign achieves good results without delaying production, and also plays a role in promoting production.

Since the release of the supplementary instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on February 18 regarding the Marriage Law implementation campaign month, leading organs and general cadres in various parts of the Southwest have become clearer about the nature, purpose, requirements, and specific methods of this campaign. Cadres and the masses have dispelled their concerns, and the cadres leading the campaign have increased their confidence. However, some cadres and masses have also developed some incorrect views. These can be summarized into two types. One is that "the campaign can be done perfunctorily, just make a few reports, publicize it, and it's done." In Chongqing, leading cadres in some districts even proposed that "no seminars or discussions are allowed" during the campaign, even prohibiting the masses from spontaneously criticizing the feudal marriage system. Individual units wanted to withdraw the cadres sent to participate in the campaign. The other is that "the central supplementary instructions say not to conduct a general inspection, so the problem cannot be solved." Some people believe that "the Marriage Law implementation campaign is all thunder and little rain," doubting whether it can make the Marriage Law known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Many activists showed signs of discouragement.

The above-mentioned various manifestations are all caused by impatience, insufficient understanding of the complexity, long-term nature, and arduousness of implementing the Marriage Law, and an unclear understanding of the basic spirit, purpose, and guiding principles of this Marriage Law implementation campaign, especially the adherence to the principle of education. Therefore, the huge role of propaganda work is underestimated to varying degrees.

In order to overcome the above-mentioned confused thinking and correctly carry out the campaign, the Southwest District Marriage Law Implementation Committee has notified all localities to seriously study the spirit of the three instructions successively issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and in accordance with the spirit of the supplementary instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, stipulated specific measures for carrying out the campaign.

The Southwest District Marriage Law Implementation Committee believes that the spirit and guiding principles of the supplementary instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the work of the Marriage Law implementation campaign month and the two instructions successively issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the Central People's Government in the past are basically consistent. They all require conducting widespread propaganda work, systematically criticizing old ideas and old habits on marriage issues, establishing a position for new ideas, new systems, and new customs, and drawing a clear ideological line between cadres and the people on the new and old marriage systems, so as to create good conditions for continuing to implement the Marriage Law in the future. However, the supplementary instructions have more explicit scope and requirements in terms of specific methods, which can concentrate forces on key and major issues, and can launch the campaign in a more planned manner. The supplementary instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China more specifically clarified how to adhere to the principle of propaganda and education, further delineated the scope of inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law, specifically stipulated the main methods and content of propaganda, and at the same time further guaranteed concrete measures to avoid being killed or injured due to marriage issues. Therefore, the supplementary instructions do not overturn the previous instructions. Those who attempt to solve all problems through the campaign, and those who separate the supplementary instructions from the previous instructions, or adopt a passive or wait-and-see attitude, are all wrong.

The Southwest District Marriage Law Implementation Committee believes that it is absolutely necessary for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to strictly limit the active investigation and handling of extremely few serious criminals among the people to the scope of "killing and injuring people's lives" in the supplementary instructions. Those who believe that all suicide cases should not be actively handled, or that all suicide cases should be brought to the campaign month for inspection and handling, are incorrect. The Southwest District Marriage Law Implementation Committee also made the following regulations: Generally, cases that have already been handled will not be re-examined; in terms of time, in principle, it will be counted from the promulgation of the Marriage Law.

The Southwest District Marriage Law Implementation Committee believes that the "conducting propaganda of the Marriage Law is limited to the general public" in the supplementary instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China refers to the inspection conducted in necessary organs and personnel. This does not mean that it can be done carelessly, as some people think "just publicize it and it's done," or "just read the documents and listen to the reports and it's done"; but it means that it is necessary to step up propaganda work. Therefore, the Southwest District Marriage Law Implementation Committee stipulates that in the propaganda, all localities must explain to the masses in detail according to the propaganda outline of the Central Marriage Law Implementation Committee, and should not carry out propaganda randomly. However, discussions and seminars are not unnecessary. The key to the problem lies in how to grasp it and how to carry out propaganda in an organized and led manner; avoid involving the problem in general male-female relationships and family relationships, and avoid creating opposition between people. Propaganda work mainly relies on the reporters of the party committees at all levels and the selected and trained staff to make reports, and then organize the party's propagandists and the activists of various people's organizations to carry out propaganda and explanation work around the reports. Various types of meetings (including family meetings, courtyard meetings, group meetings, and seminars) can also be held to deepen the propaganda work. It is wrong to think that it is not necessary to hold any meetings, only we are allowed to speak, and the masses are not allowed to speak. In the discussion, if the parties concerned consciously demand to solve their marriage problems, mediation should be carried out mainly through propaganda and education; but it is not advisable to generally call for and universally carry out "untangling knots." Only on the basis of the masses' conscious and if problems will occur if they are not handled, can the disputes be actively mediated and handled.

Since most grassroots cadres in the Southwest District do not understand the Marriage Law, the Southwest District Marriage Law Implementation Committee believes that the work of training cadres must be stepped up. Those who think that there is no need to train cadres or that less training is acceptable are wrong. The specific methods should be: cadres at the county, district, and township levels must be trained centrally or separately under the guidance of responsible cadres at the county level and above and at the county level. At the same time, a group of personnel for trial and marriage registration work must be trained in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee. The Marriage Law implementation campaign must be launched in a led manner after the cadres have been trained centrally. In areas with insufficient manpower, it can be carried out in batches and focused on key areas. When carrying out a campaign in a township (or factory, street), you can refer to the experience of Chengyu Township in Zizhong County, Sichuan Province. A working group of three to five people should be sent from the district level and above to lead the campaign. In villages and towns without working groups, propaganda activities can be carried out by district-level reporters, propagandists, and trained rural cadres and activists in people's organizations. In areas where working groups and cadre conditions are available, work can be carried out in the following steps, namely: training cadres, conducting in-depth propaganda to the masses, summarizing the campaign, electing models (the number should not be large, they must be true models, must be highly conscious, good at production, and have political conditions), and mobilizing the masses to invest in production, etc.

The Southwest District Marriage Law Implementation Committee believes that the Marriage Law implementation campaign must be closely combined with production. Specific methods can start with checking the production organization or production results, finding out the connection between production and family relations, and citing examples of families that are harmonious and united to do a good job in production when propagating to educate the masses; in terms of time, it must take into account that it does not delay production. The experience of Chengyu Township in Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, and Yuxin Textile Factory in Chongqing City have proved that the Marriage Law implementation campaign will not delay production, on the contrary, it will greatly improve production.

    西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会
    及时纠正某些干部和群众的错误思想并规定开展贯彻婚姻法运动的办法
    编者按：西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会及时纠正某些干部、群众对此次贯彻婚姻法运动的错误看法，并规定了开展运动的具体办法，是完全必要的，正确的。过去一个阶段以至目前，全国有不少地区在贯彻婚姻法问题上，均曾发生与西南区类似的混乱情况。这就必须向群众特别是向干部把政策交代清楚，扭转他们那些不健康的情绪，把运动贯彻到底。某些因人力不足，暂时不能全面开展运动的地区，也可参考西南区的办法，分批进行，重点展开。贯彻婚姻法运动结合生产进行特别重要，各地应根据当地情况安排人力和工作，要求做到既使贯彻婚姻法运动收到良好效果，又不因此耽误生产，并起推动生产的作用。
    自二月十八日中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示公布以后，西南各地领导机关和一般干部，对这次运动的性质、目的、要求及具体作法，更加明确起来。干部和群众解除了顾虑，领导运动的干部增加了信心。但某些干部和群众，也曾发生一些不正确的看法。归纳起来有两种。一种认为“运动可以潦草了事，只要作几个报告，宣传一下完事”。重庆市有个别区的领导干部，甚至提出在运动中“不准座谈、讨论”，即使群众自觉地起来批判封建婚姻制度也在禁止之例。个别机关要把派出参加运动的干部抽回去。另一种，是认为“中央补充指示说不普遍检查，就不能解决问题”。有的人认为“贯彻婚姻法运动雷声大，雨点小”，怀疑能否使婚姻法家喻户晓，深入人心。不少积极分子表现泄气情绪。
    上述种种表现，都是由急躁情绪产生的，以及对贯彻婚姻法的复杂性、长期性、艰巨性认识不足，对此次贯彻婚姻法运动的基本精神、目的、方针，尤其是坚持教育的方针不明确。因此，在不同的程度上低估了宣传工作的巨大作用。
    为了克服上述混乱思想，正确地开展运动，西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会已通知各地认真研究中共中央及政务院先后发出的三个指示的精神，并根据中共中央补充指示的精神，规定了开展运动的具体办法。
    西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会认为，中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示和过去中共中央及中央人民政府政务院先后发出的两个指示，其精神和方针基本上是一致的，都是要求普遍地进行宣传工作，系统地批驳在婚姻问题上的旧思想和旧习惯，树立新思想、新制度和新风气的阵地，使干部和人民群众在新旧婚姻制度上划清思想界限，为今后继续贯彻婚姻法创造良好条件。但补充指示在具体作法上有了更明确的范围和要求，更能集中力量在关键和主要问题上，更能有计划地展开运动。中共中央补充指示更加具体地阐明了怎样坚持宣传教育方针，进一步划清了检查婚姻法执行情况的范围，具体规定了宣传的主要方式及内容，同时进一步保证了因婚姻问题而免受杀害、伤害的具体办法。因此补充指示并不是推翻过去的指示。那些企图通过运动解决一切问题，以及把补充指示和以前的指示加以割裂，或消极、等待的情绪，都是错误的。
    西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会认为，在人民群众中主动检查和处理极少数的严重犯罪分子，中共中央在补充指示中严格限制在“杀害人命、伤害人身”的范围内，是十分必要的。那些认为凡是自杀案件一概不应主动处理，或把所有自杀案件都拿到运动月来检查处理的意见都是不对的。西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会并作了这样的规定：案件已处理过的，一般的不翻老账；在时间上，原则上以婚姻法颁布以后算起。
    西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会认为，中共中央补充指示中的“对一般人民群众应以进行婚姻法的宣传为限”，是对照着在必要的机关和人员中进行检查而言。这不是说可以马马虎虎，如有些人认为的“只宣传一下了事”，或“只要看看文件，听听报告算了”；而是说需要加紧作好宣传工作。因此，西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会规定，各地在宣传中，一定要根据中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会的宣传提纲，向群众详细解释，不能随便乱宣传。但讨论、座谈并不是不需要的。问题的关键在于如何掌握，如何有组织有领导地进行宣传；避免把问题牵涉到一般的男女关系和家庭关系中去，避免造成人与人的对立。宣传工作主要是依靠各级党委的报告员和经过选择训练的工作人员作报告，然后组织党的宣传员和各人民团体的积极分子，围绕着报告作宣传解释工作。还可以召开各种类型的会议（包括家庭会、院落会、小组会、座谈会），把宣传工作深入一步。那种认为不必要开什么会，只准我们说，不让群众说的做法，是不对的。在讨论中，如当事人自觉地要求解决其婚姻问题，应以宣传教育为主进行调解；但不宜一般号召及普遍进行“解疙瘩”，只有在群众自觉基础上和如不处理就要发生问题时，可主动调解处理其纠纷。
    由于西南区大多数基层干部不懂婚姻法，因此，西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会认为，必须加紧训练干部的工作。那些认为不需要训练干部或可以少训练等想法是错误的。具体做法应是：县、区、乡各级干部必须在县以上和县级负责干部的指导下集中训练或分别训练。同时必须按照中央的指示，训练一批作审判和婚姻登记工作的人员。贯彻婚姻法运动必须在干部集中训练好之后，再有领导地开展运动。在人力不足的地区，可分批进行，重点展开。在一个乡（或工厂、街道）开展运动，可参考四川资中县成渝乡的经验，要由区以上各级机关派出三至五人的工作组进行领导。没有工作组的乡村，可由区级报告员、宣传员和受过训练的乡村干部、人民团体中的积极分子进行宣传活动。在有工作组及干部条件具备的地区，可按下列步骤进行工作，即：训练干部，向群众深入宣传，总结运动，选举模范（人数不能多，要真正是模范，要觉悟高、生产好、有政治条件的）及动员群众投入生产等顺序。
    西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会认为，贯彻婚姻法运动必须紧密结合生产。具体做法可从检查生产组织或生产成绩着手，找出生产与家庭关系两者之间的联系，在宣传时多举家庭和睦团结搞好生产的实例教育群众；在时间上，必须照顾到不误生产。四川省资中县成渝乡和重庆市渝新纺织厂的经验都已证明，贯彻婚姻法运动不会耽误生产，相反的，会把生产大大提高一步。
