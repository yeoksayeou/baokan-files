Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 27th. Our correspondent Hua Min reports: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army snipers on the left flank of Shangganling have been actively sniping at enemy soldiers, killing or wounding over 750 enemy soldiers from early December of last year to the end of February this year.

This area has always been a hotbed of activity for Volunteer Army snipers. Last summer and autumn, the famous sniper Zou Xixiang and his comrades killed and wounded over 1,000 enemy soldiers here. The enemy was so terrified that they called this mountain range "Sniper Ridge." After the victory of the Shangganling Campaign, the brave snipers resumed their old "trade," making the enemies on the opposite positions panic and uneasy. On average, nearly a squad of enemies were killed or wounded every day.

The snipers often accurately shot enemies who came out to move around in the heavy morning fog. Sniper Chen Shanghe shot down two enemies who were active on the enemy positions. After the morning fog dissipated, he shot and killed another enemy who didn't have time to hide.

In the severe winter when wind and snow filled the sky, the snipers would climb to places very close to the enemy and hide to snipe at them. Sniper Yang Guitian once killed an enemy digging mud and an enemy sentry in this way. Sometimes, the snipers would also work with the artillery and machine gunners to blast the enemies hiding in the bunkers out, and then beat them up severely. On January 17th, the snipers saw eighteen enemies entering a bunker, and immediately notified the artillery with a walkie-talkie. The artillery used a few shells to blow up the enemy's bunker. The enemies who were lucky enough not to be killed escaped, but were all shot and killed by machine gunner Li Jiming.

At night, the enemy was afraid of our army's attacks, so they used strong searchlights to illuminate "Sniper Ridge," and our snipers used the light of the searchlights to find the enemy. Squad leader Wang Fengji saw two enemies at the entrance of the enemy's "cat ear hole" (small tunnel). He picked up his submachine gun and shot down one, and the other enemy escaped into the hole. In the middle of the night, a burst of chaotic footsteps came from the enemy's position. Wang Fengji lay on the ground and saw a squad of enemies changing shifts in a panic. He immediately picked up his machine gun and fired, killing and wounding many enemies.

The enemy was frightened and racked their brains to come up with various tricks to escape the snipers' attacks, but they were often seen through by the snipers. Once, on the main road of the enemy's position, four people stood upright. The snipers were very strange, because usually the enemies moved around stealthily, how dare these four enemies stand still in broad daylight? They looked carefully with binoculars and found that they were made of straw. At dusk, these straw men suddenly increased to more than a dozen and moved in the twilight. The snipers determined that this was the enemy using straw men to cover living people carrying supplies, so at a command, machine guns and automatic rifles opened fire together, and the real and fake people on the enemy's position were shot down.

Throughout the winter, the enemies on the front-line positions were beaten so badly that they dared not leave the bunkers all day long, and even dared not communicate with each other even if they were only three or four steps away.

### 上甘岭左侧山头阵地上  我狙击兵在三个月内毙伤敌七百多名

    上甘岭左侧山头阵地上
    我狙击兵在三个月内毙伤敌七百多名
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】本社记者华敏报道：上甘岭左侧山头阵地上的中国人民志愿军狙击兵们，积极狙击敌兵，自去年十二月初到今年二月底已毙伤敌军七百五十多名。
    这一带阵地一向是志愿军狙击兵活跃的地方，去年夏天和秋天，著名的狙击手邹习祥和他的战友们在这里打死打伤了一千多名敌军。敌人曾惊恐地把这一带山岭称为“狙击兵岭”。上甘岭战役胜利结束后，勇敢的狙击兵们又恢复了老“行业”，他们打得对面阵地上的敌人惊恐不安，平均每天都有近一个班的敌人被打死打伤。
    狙击兵们经常准确地射击在清晨雾浓时出来活动的敌人。狙击兵陈尚和就打倒了两个在敌人阵地上活动的敌人。晨雾消散以后，他又把另一个未及躲藏的敌人打死。
    在严冬风雪满天的时候，狙击手们就爬到离敌人很近的地方隐蔽起来狙击敌人。狙击兵杨桂田有一次就这样打死了一个挖泥土的敌人和一个敌军的哨兵。有时，狙击兵们还联合炮兵、机枪手把躲在地堡里的敌人轰出来，再痛痛快快地打他们。一月十七日，狙击兵们看到有十八个敌人进入一个地堡里，便立即用步行机通知了炮兵，炮兵用几发炮弹就把敌人的地堡炸翻了，侥幸没被炸死的敌人逃出来，又被机枪手李积明全部打死。
    夜晚，敌人害怕我军袭击，他们用强烈的探照灯光将“狙击兵岭”照得通明，我军狙击兵便借着探照灯的灯光寻找敌人。班长王丰吉看见敌人的“猫耳洞”（小坑道）口上有两个敌人，他端起冲锋枪，打倒了一个，另一个敌人逃进洞里。半夜，敌人阵地上传来一阵杂乱的脚步声，王丰吉伏在地面上一看，发现有一班敌人慌慌张张地换防，他立刻端起机枪射击，打得敌人死伤了许多。
    敌人被打怕了，煞费苦心地想出种种花样来逃脱狙击兵的打击，但是却常常被狙击兵们识破。有一次，在敌军阵地的主要通路上，直挺挺地立起四个人。狙击兵们都很奇怪，因为平时敌人走动都是偷偷摸摸的，这四个敌人怎么敢白天站着不动？他们用望远镜仔细一看，原来是用稻草扎成的。黄昏时，这些草人忽然增多到十多个，并且在暮色中走动起来。狙击兵们判明了这是敌人用草人来掩护活人搬运物资，于是一声口令下，机关枪、自动步枪一齐开起火来，敌人阵地上的真人假人都被打倒了。
    在整个冬天里，前线阵地上的敌人被打得整日不敢出地堡，甚至相隔三四步远也不敢互相来往。
