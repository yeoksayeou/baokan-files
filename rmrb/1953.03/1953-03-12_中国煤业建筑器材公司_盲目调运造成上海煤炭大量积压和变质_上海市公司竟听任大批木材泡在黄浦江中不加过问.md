The China Coal Mining Building Materials Company, blindly catering to "coal mine production," erroneously decided on the policy of "rather store at the sales location than at the production location," transferring large quantities of coal to Shanghai in 1952, resulting in large-scale accumulation, spontaneous combustion, and weathering deterioration of coal in Shanghai.

Last year, the average monthly coal inventory of the Shanghai Municipal Company exceeded demand by more than 640,000 tons, resulting in interest losses of 25.8 billion yuan and storage fee losses of 6.99 billion yuan. The coal inventory of the Shanghai Municipal Company exceeded the highest coal inventory in Shanghai's history. Insufficient space forced the company to increase the height and size of coal piles, which increased handling costs. Excessive coal accumulation prevented the municipal company from dealing with it in a timely manner, leading to serious accidents of heating, spontaneous combustion, and weathering deterioration of a large amount of stored coal. According to a survey on January 28, over 183,000 tons of coal stored by the municipal company had temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius, and over 55,000 tons had weathered and deteriorated. The municipal company spent a great deal of manpower and material resources to salvage this coal.

According to the municipal company's estimate, approximately 100,000 tons of the coal allocated to Shanghai by the head office over the past three years contained stones and gangue. More than 20,000 tons have already been picked out, resulting in losses of 6.99 billion yuan. One hundred thousand tons of stones and gangue waste more than 3,000 railcars with a capacity of 30 tons in transportation. Intra-city transport would waste more than 30,000 trucks with a capacity of 2.5 tons. The losses caused by this low-quality coal to factory production and residential users are incalculable. Last spring, a textile factory in Shanghai was forced to suspend production due to insufficient water temperature caused by the use of low-quality coal. The municipal company has reported these situations to the head office many times and requested that stones and gangue be picked out at the production site or transshipment points, but has never received a reply from the head office.

The China Coal Mining Building Materials Company's one-sided support for coal mine production has actually led to completely opposite results. The losses of the Shanghai Municipal Company alone, calculated at 100 billion yuan, could sustain the lives of 230,000 people for a year.

Xinhua News Agency report: The Shanghai Municipal Company of China Coal Mining Building Materials Company has been managing timber for two and a half years, but to this day, no one in the company knows for sure how much goods have been received in the past two and a half years, nor does anyone know for sure how much stock is currently available or where it is located. More than half of the company's existing timber is chaotically placed in the Huangpu River, with 3,500 cubic meters already decayed and another 3,000 cubic meters sunk to the bottom of the river, the deepest of which are two meters below the mud at the bottom of the river.

Another portion of the timber is entrusted to 17 private timber firms at Shanghai's South Wharf for receiving, dispatching, and storage. The company has not only never inspected or inventoried the timber, but also failed to conduct strict supervision during the receiving and dispatching of goods. As for the losses due to theft and drift, it is impossible to ascertain the exact amount. The company still does not have a reliable material ledger, resulting in frequent instances of goods without accounts, accounts without goods, duplicate accounts, incorrect accounts, and red accounts (i.e., goods sold but not recorded in the accounts).

The employees of the Shanghai Coal and Construction Company have raised many opinions regarding these chaotic phenomena, but the leadership either responds that "it has been reported to the superior company" or tells them to "overcome difficulties," and sometimes simply ignores them. Since the labor competition began last August, the masses have put forward many rationalization proposals, but the leadership has not paid attention to them, and some suggestions have even been lost. Leaders at all levels of the company rarely go to factories and warehouses to inspect work. Even when a typhoon hit Shanghai and there was a danger of the timber rafts in the water being scattered, the employees in the timber yards patrolled along the river all night in the wind and rain, while the person in charge of the storage and transportation section only made a phone call in the company office. When timber from other places was transported to Shanghai, the company's temporary site lacked a fence or office, and the employees guarded it overnight in the cold wind and rain. However, none of the leading cadres paid attention to these exemplary actions of highly valuing and taking responsibility for the people's property. After an accident occurred, the leaders of various departments shirked responsibility and blamed each other, with no one taking responsibility, which the employees called "playing Tai Chi."

Most of the timber transferred from the Northeast Coal and Construction Company to Shanghai is third-grade or substandard timber, and even a large amount of decayed timber. In 1951, a ship of timber was transported, and more than half of it was decayed. The Shanghai Municipal Company reported this to the China Coal and Construction Company, but no serious handling measures have been seen to date. Meanwhile, the East China Coal and Construction Company, which is located in the same place as the Shanghai Municipal Coal and Construction Company, is completely unaware of these problems. In mid-January, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee ordered the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Commerce to inspect the company's timber management problems, but the inspection team from the Bureau of Commerce only went to the company for a few days, made a rescue plan and handed it over to the company before returning. The company's employees originally had high hopes for the inspection team, hoping that the inspection team could help them launch a struggle against bureaucracy to improve their work, but it has been more than a month now, and the inspection team has not yet met with the masses.

### 中国煤业建筑器材公司  盲目调运造成上海煤炭大量积压和变质  上海市公司竟听任大批木材泡在黄浦江中不加过问

    中国煤业建筑器材公司
    盲目调运造成上海煤炭大量积压和变质
    上海市公司竟听任大批木材泡在黄浦江中不加过问
    中国煤业建筑器材公司盲目照顾“煤矿生产”，错误地决定“宁存销地，毋存产地”的方针，在一九五二年内调运大批煤炭到上海，致使上海煤炭大量积压、自燃和风化变质。
    去年，上海市公司煤炭库存量每月平均超过需要量六十四万多吨，利息损失达二百五十八亿元，保管费损失六十九亿九千万元。上海市公司的存煤超过上海历史上最高的存煤量，场地不敷应用，只有把煤堆加高加大，这样，搬运费就增加了。煤炭积压过多，市公司无法及时处理，又造成了大量存煤发热、自燃和风化变质的严重事故。据一月二十八日调查，市公司存煤温度高至摄氏五十度以上的有十八万三千多吨，风化变质的有五万五千多吨。市公司为抢救这些煤炭，在人力物力方面的化费很大。
    据市公司估计，三年来总公司调拨上海的煤炭中，夹杂石块、僵石在十万吨左右，已拣出的有二万多吨，损失达六十九亿九千万元。十万吨石块、僵石在运输方面要浪费三十吨容量的车皮三千多个，如在市内运输，要浪费二吨半容量的卡车三万多辆。这些劣质煤，给工厂生产和居民用户的损失，无法计算。去年春季，上海市某纺织厂由于使用劣质煤，水汀热度不足，发生停工事故。市公司曾把这些情况向总公司反映多次，并要求在产地或转运地点把石块、僵石拣去，但从未得到总公司的答复。
    中国煤业建筑器材公司这种片面扶助煤矿生产的做法，实际上得到了完全相反的结果。仅以上海市公司损失一千亿元计算，就可以维持二十三万人一年的生活。
    又讯：中国煤业建筑器材公司上海市公司经营木材已有两年半，但至今公司内还没有一个人确实知道两年半中进了多少货，也没有一个人确实知道现在有多少存货，放在什么地方。这个公司现存的木材有一半以上杂乱地放在黄浦江中，有三千五百立方公尺已腐朽，另有三千多立方公尺已沉入江底，其中最深的在江底泥下两公尺。
    另有一部分木材是委托上海南码头十七家私营木行收发、保管的。公司不仅从未去检查清点，甚至在收发货时也没有进行严格的监督。至于被盗窃和漂失等的损失究竟有多少，已无从追查。这个公司至今没有一本可靠的材料账，因此，有货无账，有账无货，重账，错账，红账（即账上没有的、商品已出售的账）的事层出不穷。
    上海市煤建公司的职工对于这些混乱现象，曾提出不少意见，但领导方面不是答复“已向上级公司反映过了”，便是叫他们“克服困难”，有时甚至完全不理。自去年八月劳动竞赛展开后，群众提了不少合理化建议，但领导方面并未加以重视，有些建议竟被遗失了。公司各级领导人很少下厂栈检查工作，甚至当台风袭击上海，水中木排有被打散的危险时，木栈中职工都连夜冒大风雨沿江巡视，而储运科负责人只在公司办公室内打个电话。外地木材运到上海，因公司临时找的场地没有围墙，也没有办公室，职工们在寒风大雨中整夜巡守着。而这些对人民财产高度爱护负责的模范行动，从没有一个领导干部关照。发生事故后，各部门领导人之间便互相推诿，互相责备，谁也不负责任，职工群众称之为“打太极拳”。
     东北煤建公司调上海的木材大多是三等材和不够等级的木材，甚至有大批腐朽材，一九五一年曾运到一船木材，竟有一半以上是腐朽的。上海市公司曾报告过中国煤建公司，但至今未见有什么认真的处理办法。而华东煤建公司就和上海市煤建公司同住一地，竟对这些问题一点不知道。一月中旬，中共上海市委员会和上海市人民政府财经委员会责令上海市人民政府商业局对该公司木材经营问题进行检查，但商业局检查组只到该公司去了几天，作了一个抢救计划交给公司后便回去了。该公司职工群众原来对检查组抱着很大希望，希望检查组能帮助他们开展反官僚主义斗争以改进工作，但至今已有一个多月了，检查组还没有和群众见面。
