    Using Practical Actions to Mourn Comrade Stalin
    Workers Across the Country Redouble Efforts to Increase Production
     [Our Newspaper] In these days of deeply mourning Comrade Stalin, workers across the country are transforming grief into strength, using practical actions to commemorate Comrade Stalin. They are redoubling their efforts to increase production and striving to fulfill and overfulfill their first-quarter production plans.
    After hearing the news of Comrade Stalin's death, workers at the Northeast 53rd Factory resolved to transform their immense grief into staunch strength, using new production achievements and inventions to mourn Comrade Stalin. In one process in the Sixth Workshop, workers relied on large iron hammers to forge knives, producing only fifty knives a day. Veteran worker Wang Wenfa devised a method on that day to create a slot with a pressure plate on top, converting it into an automated electric hammer for forging knives. As a result, not only could they save ten kilograms of coke per day, but the quality also improved by 30%, and the output increased twofold. Workers in the Sixth Shift of the Third Work Section of the Anshan Mechanical Installation Team expressed their determination to complete the March task five days ahead of schedule to mourn Comrade Stalin. Under the idea of "Striving for production to mourn Stalin," workers in the First Workshop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Small Rolling Mill have exceeded the production plan every day since the 6th, exceeding the plan by more than 10% on most days. More than 400 workers from the Metal Structure Engineering Company, who are installing the factory building frame at the Anshan 101 construction site, launched a competition on the 9th - the day of Stalin's funeral - to ensure the completion of the March installation task, which is two and a half times larger than in February. The Jin Changming group in the Wood Mold Workshop of the Processing Plant of the Anshan First Civil Engineering Company's 101 construction site is formulating a group plan to launch a competition in mid-March.
    In Beijing, when the news of Comrade Stalin's death reached the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, the Chen Yongxiang Model Group in the Forging Workshop was discussing the formulation of a production plan. They immediately proposed a guarantee: "Formulate an advanced group plan to ensure the realization of the improvement of five kinds of tools within two months. Learn from each other's advanced experience, do not waste a minute, improve quality, and reduce waste products." After Wang Hongji, a worker at the Beijing Clothing Factory, proposed using practical actions to mourn Comrade Stalin on the 6th, he increased his daily production of collars from 800 to 900 that day, and then to 1,030 on the 7th. More than 2,000 workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and five other steel plants across the country are carrying out the project of overhauling the blast furnace. All the workers, in order to mourn Comrade Stalin, threw themselves into production with vigor. New records appeared. The Jin Fusuo group increased the number of refractory bricks laid from 80 to 118 per shift. The workers in Liu Yushu's group, who were laying the furnace bottom, hammered the uneven parts of the refractory bricks to make sure that no unqualified refractory bricks were laid in the blast furnace; the workers transporting the huge bricks adopted the Soviet advanced experience of flow-line segmentation, creating a record of 128 bricks laid per shift. On the 9th, the Shen Yantong group created a record of 179 bricks laid per shift.
    In Tianjin, Li Xiuzhen, a weaver at the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, used to weave more than 36 yards of cloth per day. During the days of mourning Stalin, she was determined to study hard and reached 37 yards on the 9th, without producing any defective cloth. Under the slogan of "Increase production to commemorate Stalin," the sand-casting group workers in the repair workshop of the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory used their brains to improve labor organization, increasing output by more than double.
    In Shanghai, workers in the steelmaking workshop of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company's Third Factory, who had been guided and assisted by Soviet experts, recently increased the rate of high-quality steel products from 94% to 96% in the past four days, and the smelting time for each furnace of steel was shortened by half an hour. After a certain group in the large-parts section of the state-owned Qiujiang Machinery Factory issued a challenge to the entire workshop to complete the March task ahead of schedule, five groups immediately responded to the challenge.
    In Taiyuan, the electric furnace steelmaking department of the state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant successfully trial-smelted heat-resistant high-chromium steel for the first time on the 7th. The workers expressed that they would use this production achievement as a gift at the time of Comrade Stalin's burial. Labor model Huang Qingtai said: "Our steelmaking department was established with the personal help of Soviet experts cultivated by Stalin. Not only do we present Comrade Stalin with new production achievements today, but we will also better learn from Soviet advanced experience in the future and achieve greater production achievements."
    In Chongqing, the workers of the Ninth Group of Class C of the Chongqing 610 Yarn Factory hung a sign in the workshop that read: "Mourn Comrade Stalin, and strive to shorten the doffing and stop-car time." The workers worked more seriously and diligently as they saw Stalin's name. The doffing time was reduced from 45 seconds to 30 seconds in one day. In the past, the workers in the steelmaking plant of the Chongqing 101 Steel Plant did not thoroughly implement the Soviet experts' opinions on operation. Now, under the lofty slogan of "For Stalin's cause," they earnestly and better implement the opinions of Soviet experts, and the quality of steel ingots immediately improved.

    用实际行动来悼念斯大林同志
    全国各地职工加倍努力提高生产
     【本报讯】在沉痛悼念斯大林同志的日子里，全国各地职工化悲痛为力量，用实际行动来纪念斯大林同志，他们正加倍努力提高生产，争取完成和超额完成第一季度生产计划。
    东北五三工厂职工们在听到斯大林同志逝世消息后，决心把无比的悲痛化为坚强的力量，用新的生产成绩和发明创造来悼念斯大林同志。六车间有一道工序，是靠工人用大铁锤打刀，一天只能打五十把；老工人王文发当天想办法做出一个槽子，上边搁压板，改成自动化的电锤打刀。结果不但每天能节省十公斤焦炭，质量还提高了百分之三十，产量增加了两倍。鞍山机械安装队第三工段第六班工人表示决心以提前五天完成三月份任务，来悼念斯大林同志。鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂第一车间的工人们，在“努力生产，悼念斯大林”的意念下，从六日到现在，天天超过生产计划，最多时每天超过计划百分之十以上。正在鞍山一○一工地安装厂房房架的金属结构工程公司的四百多个工人，已在九日——斯大林殡葬的日子展开了竞赛，保证完成比二月份大二倍半的三月份安装任务。鞍山第一土建工程公司加工厂一○一工地木模车间金长明小组，正在制订小组计划，以便在三月中旬展开竞赛。
    在北京，斯大林同志逝世的消息传到华北农业机械总厂的时候，锻工场陈永祥模范小组正在讨论订生产计划，他们立刻提出保证：“订好先进的小组计划，保证在两个月内实现五种工具的改进。互相学习先进经验，不浪费一分钟，提高质量，减少废品。”北京被服厂工人王洪吉在六日提出用实际行动来悼念斯大林同志后，当天他做领子就由每天八百个增加到九百个，七日又增加到一千零三十个。石景山钢铁厂工人和来自全国五个钢铁厂的工人两千多人，正在进行高炉大修的工程。全体工人为了悼念斯大林同志，精神抖擞地投入生产。新纪录出现了，金福锁小组把砌耐火砖的数目，由一班砌八十块提高到砌一百一十八块。刘玉树小组砌炉底的工人用锤子敲平耐火砖上凸凹的地方，决不使有一块不合规格的耐火砖砌在高炉里；搬运巨砖的工人，采用了流水分段的苏联先进经验，创造了一班砌砖一百二十八块的纪录。九日沈燕桐小组更创造了一班砌砖一百七十九块的纪录。
    在天津，国营天津第一棉纺织厂织布工人李秀珍，以前每天织布三十六码多，在追悼斯大林的日子里，她决心努力学习，在九日达到了三十七码，并且未出次布。第二棉纺织厂修机车间的翻砂小组工人们，在“提高产量，纪念斯大林”的口号下，开动脑筋，改善劳动组织，使产量提高一倍多。
    在上海，曾经受到苏联专家指导和帮助过的上海钢铁公司的第三厂炼钢车间工人，在最近四天内将优等钢产品比率由百分之九十四提高到百分之九十六，每炉钢冶炼时间缩短了半小时。国营虬江机器厂大件工段某小组向全车间提出提前完成三月份任务的挑战后，已有五个小组立即应战。
    在太原，国营太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部在七日第一次试炼耐热高铬钢成功，工人们表示要把这个生产成就作为在斯大林同志安葬时的献礼。劳动模范黄庆泰说：“我们的炼钢部是在斯大林培养出来的苏联专家亲手帮助下建立的，我们不仅今天以新的生产成就给斯大林同志献礼，今后还要更好地学习苏联先进经验，取得更大的生产成就。”
    在重庆，重庆六一零纱厂丙班九小组工人在车间挂了一个牌子，上面写着：“悼念斯大林同志，努力缩短落纱关车时间。”工人们看到斯大林的名字，就愈益严肃努力地工作。落纱时间在一天之内由四十五秒降为三十秒。重庆一零一钢铁厂的炼钢场工人，过去实行苏联专家关于操作上的意见不够彻底。现在，他们在“为了斯大林的事业”的崇高口号下，认真地更好地实行苏联专家的意见，钢锭的质量立刻提高。
