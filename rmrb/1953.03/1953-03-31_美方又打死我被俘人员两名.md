    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 30th: According to an announcement by the U.S. side, the U.S. side has killed two more of our captured personnel on Geoje Island. On March 26th, the U.S. side used the excuse of "planning to escape" to shoot and kill one prisoner of war. On March 27th, the U.S. side killed another prisoner of war. According to the U.S. side, this prisoner of war was killed because he "attacked" a "supervisory worker," and this U.S. personnel had ordered the prisoner of war not to "feign illness." It can be clearly seen from this that the U.S. side is forcing sick prisoners of war to do hard labor, and when they do not have the strength to work, they casually fabricate an excuse to kill them.

    美方又打死我被俘人员两名
    【新华社开城三十日电】据美方宣布，美方在巨济岛上又打死我方被俘人员两人。三月二十六日，美方以“打算逃跑”为借口开枪打死战俘一人。三月二十七日，美方又打死战俘一人。据美方宣称，这个战俘所以被打死，是因为他“袭击”一个“监督工作的人”，这个美方人员曾命令战俘不要“装病”。从这里可以清楚地看出，美方正在强迫生病的战俘从事苦役，并且在他们没有力气做工时，就随便制造一个借口把他们打死。
