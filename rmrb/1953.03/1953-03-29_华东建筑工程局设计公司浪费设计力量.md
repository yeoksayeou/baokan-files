Title: Design Company of the East China Construction Engineering Bureau Wastes Design Resources

The crucial step in ensuring timely commencement and overcoming the risk of idle labor in the East China region's capital construction projects currently lies in boosting design work efficiency and striving for the swift completion of design blueprints. However, the design resources of the East China Construction Engineering Bureau's design company are being severely wasted. In 1952, the company could complete an average of 75,000 square meters of technical designs per month. This year, with the addition of more designers, it planned to complete 100,000 square meters per month. In reality, however, the company only completed 4,800 square meters in January and February this year, which is less than one-fortieth of its design capacity.

This waste is mainly manifested in the following three aspects:

	I. A significant amount of design work is rendered useless due to changes in the plans of the client entities. From December of last year to January of this year, the company completed a total of 370,000 square meters of technical designs; by late February, due to changes in the plans of the client entities, only 144,400 square meters remained, and the rest of the designs were wasted. Among the 144,400 square meters of designed projects, thirteen were commissioned by the former Northeast Industrial Department, which were changed repeatedly. By March of this year, these thirteen projects had been reduced to only two. Of these two projects, one was shelved due to a recent discovery of a conflict between the construction site and the municipal construction plan, leaving only one project remaining today. The design of these thirteen projects began on August 14th of last year. The design company sent specialists to the Northeast several times to design sketches, and the company mobilized significant internal resources. Now, all that effort has been wasted. According to statistics, the technical design alone wasted 9,373 working hours. There are many similar examples. For example, the work done by the 56 staff members of the company's Culture and Education Design Office in January and February was also completely ineffective due to plan changes. Zhang Gongfu, a technician in the Culture and Education Design Office, designed four projects in the five months he had been with the company, all of which were unused due to plan changes. This situation has led to a general decline in the production morale of the design company's staff, and a loss of confidence in their work. They say: "The drawing I painstakingly create today may be thrown into the wastebasket tomorrow."

	II. Serious rework is caused by the client entities' inadequate planning. For example, after the Navy commissioned the design of office buildings, dormitories, and other projects last year, and the overall layout and drilling work were completed, the Navy suddenly proposed to expand the land area, and some foundations had to be changed. This meant that the site plan had to be rearranged and the drilling redone. After the design was completed, the Navy again proposed to add a nursery. The design of the nursery was continuously changed four times. Recently, the construction details of this project were all completed, but the Navy actually proposed to reduce the construction area, resulting in a complete redesign. As another example, the hospital project commissioned by the Air Force was originally planned for 200 beds, but later it was proposed to increase it to 250 beds. After the preliminary design was completed, it was proposed to change it to 300 beds, completely disrupting the design. Last year, the company suffered significant losses due to this kind of rework. In half a year, 69 of the 214 preliminary designs were completely abandoned for this reason, wasting one-third of its resources. Based on the current situation, design rework this year may be even more serious.

	III. Design personnel are kept waiting and unable to start designing due to insufficient design basis. This is mostly because the client entities are not fully prepared when preparing basic construction plans. In some cases, the basic construction budget does not match the construction requirements; in others, the design data is incomplete; and in some cases, they even submit designs without a construction site. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions commissioned the design of eight construction projects related to culture, education, and labor protection in February this year. There is a significant discrepancy between the investment and the construction requirements. For example, the investment for the cadre school project is 7.5 billion yuan, but according to their construction requirements, even if calculated at the lowest cost in Shanghai, it would require 14 billion yuan, almost double the amount. This project has been delayed until now and has not been resolved, and the designers responsible for this project have no choice but to wait. As another example, the construction site for the Shanghai Medical College's laboratory and classroom projects has not yet been determined before commissioning the design. Now that the preliminary design has been completed, it is not known where to place it, so it has to be shelved.

The reasons for the serious waste of design resources described above, in addition to some plan changes made by higher-level leading organs, is to a great extent attributable to the fact that some client entities rely solely on the design departments and have not established a positive cooperative attitude of "working together to do a good job in basic construction." At the same time, the design company also lacks the initiative to help client entities collect design data and overcome difficulties. They rely on each other and wait for each other, ultimately causing losses to the work. Now, the design company has begun to pay attention to overcoming these shortcomings. For example, when the Shanghai Medical College's project design data was incomplete, the company sent two people to the construction unit to hold a symposium, collect data, and conduct joint research, which played a role in accelerating the design work. However, the overall situation of serious waste of design resources in the company has not yet been changed, and it needs the attention of the leading departments of basic construction in the East China region to resolve.

### 华东建筑工程局设计公司浪费设计力量

    华东建筑工程局设计公司浪费设计力量
    提高设计工作效率，争取迅速地做出设计图样，是当前华东地区基本建设工作中争取按时开工，克服窝工危险的决定性环节之一。但到现在为止，华东建筑工程局设计公司的设计力量却在十分严重地浪费着。一九五二年，该公司每月平均可以完成技术设计七万五千平方公尺，今年增加了一批设计人员，计划每月可以完成十万平方公尺的设计。但实际上该公司今年一、二两个月仅完成四千八百平方公尺，还不到设计能力的四十分之一。
    这种浪费主要表现在如下三方面：
    一、由于委托设计单位变动计划，大量的设计作废了。该公司从去年十二月到今年一月，共做了三十七万平方公尺的技术设计；到二月下旬，委托单位变动了计划，只剩下了十四万四千平方公尺，其余的设计都白作了。这十四万四千平方公尺的设计工程中有十三件工程是前东北工业部委托设计的，也是一变再变，到今年三月，这十三件工程又削减到只剩下两件。这两件工程中，又有一件因最近发现基地与市政建设计划冲突而搁了浅，结果到今天只剩下了一件。这十三件工程是从去年八月十四日就开始设计的，设计公司曾数次派了专人去东北作草图设计，公司内部也动员了很大力量，现在全部白费了。据统计，仅技术设计就浪费了九千三百七十三个工作小时。类似这样的例子还有很多。像该公司文教设计室五十六个工作人员在一、二月份中做的工作，也是因为计划变动，全部无效，文教设计室技术员章公孚来公司五个月，设计了四件工程，都因计划变更而未用。这种情况使得设计公司的工作人员生产情绪普遍低落，对工作丧失信心，他们说：“我今天辛辛苦苦画出的图，也许明天就要丢到纸篓里。”
    二、由于委托设计单位计划不周，造成了严重的返工。例如海军某部去年委托设计办公大楼、宿舍等工程，总体布置、钻探工作全部做好后，该部突然提出要扩展地皮，有的地基要更动，这样就只好重新排列地盘图，重新钻探。俟设计完成后，该部又提出要增添托儿所。在设计托儿所过程中又连续改变了四次。最近，这项工程的施工详图已全部完成了，该部竟又提出要缩小建筑范围，结果全部设计又要重新来过。又如空军某部委托设计的医院工程，原来决定是二百个床位，后来又提出增加五十个床位，待初步设计完成后，又提出要改为三百个床位，把设计又全部打乱了。去年该公司由于这种返工，曾招致了很大损失，半年中作了二百十四件初步设计，有六十九件因为这个原因全部作废，浪费了三分之一的力量。按照目前的情况来看，今年的设计返工可能更严重。
    三、由于设计的根据不足，使设计人员空等着不能动手设计。这大都是由于委托单位在备制基本建设计划时准备不充分，有的是基本建设预算与建筑要求不符合；有的是设计资料不全；有的甚至还没有基地就拿来设计。上海总工会今年二月委托设计八项文教与劳保事业方面的建筑工程，投资与建筑要求有很大距离，如其中干部学校工程，投资是七十五亿元，可是按照他们的建筑要求，即使以上海最低的造价来计算，也要一百四十亿元，几乎相差一倍。这件工程一直拖到现在仍未解决，负责这一工程的设计人员也只好等着。又如上海医学院的实验馆、教室等工程，建筑基地还没有确定就委托设计，现在做好了初步设计，却不知摆到那里，也只好搁了下来。
    造成以上设计力量严重浪费的原因，除了有些是上级领导机关改变计划外，一个很重要的原因是有些委托单位单纯依赖设计部门，没有树立起“共同努力做好基本建设”的积极合作态度。同时，设计公司也缺乏主动帮助委托单位搜集设计资料和克服困难的精神。彼此相互依赖，相互等待，终至使工作遭到损失。现在，设计公司已开始注意克服这方面的缺点，例如上海医学院的工程设计资料不全，公司就派了两个人到建筑单位去召开座谈会，搜集资料，共同研究，对加速设计工作起了一些作用。但是，现在该公司设计力量严重浪费的总情况仍未能改变，需要华东区基本建设的领导部门注意解决。
