		North China Region Holds Expanded Meeting of Sports Work Cadres
	The Sports Commission of the North China Administrative Council convened an expanded meeting of sports work cadres in the North China region from March 13 to 16. In addition to cadres in charge of sports from various provinces and cities in North China, representatives from relevant organs and organizations such as the Central Sports Commission, the North China Military Region, the Trade Union, and the Communist Youth League also attended the meeting. The meeting criticized the past tendency of sports organizations at all levels to only focus on holding sports meets, failing to conduct in-depth investigations into the health conditions of the broad masses and shouting empty slogans about sports without considering the actual effects. The meeting determined the policy of facing the grassroots, facing the broad masses, and vigorously developing mass sports activities. In order to implement the above policy, the meeting considered that the first step should be to vigorously develop organized mass sports activities in schools, factories, organs, and rural areas, and to strengthen patriotic education and scientific hygiene education in sports propaganda work.
