Reader's Letters Abstract

    I want to correct the mistake of not paying attention to handling people's letters
    Chen Xin, from the CCP Yuebei District Committee, writes: I am responsible for handling people's letters. Once, the Secretary-General of the District Party Committee, in order to handle a letter from the masses reflecting their understanding of the Marriage Law, revised the draft reply we prepared several times. But I didn't deeply realize why it was necessary to handle it so carefully. After reading the People's Daily editorial on January 19th, "Seriously Handle Letters from the People and Boldly Expose the Crimes of Bureaucracy," I felt that I was committing a crime. I once felt fortunate that the number of letters from the people was decreasing. At the end of last year, a businessman from Wengyuan Market Town wrote many accusation letters, and I immediately developed a feeling of annoyance; I thought forwarding them was enough. The article "Governments at All Levels in Various Regions Should Pay More Attention to Letters and Visits from the People" in the People's Daily on January 19th pointed out the shortcomings of "not establishing necessary systems," "shirking responsibility," "handling things carelessly," and "not receiving visiting masses with patience and enthusiasm." After comparing myself, I have all of them. The harm caused by my irresponsibility is truly unimaginable. Now, I recognize my mistake. In the future, I must pay attention to my work, improve my work, to make up for the losses I have caused to the Party and the people in the past.

### 我要改正不重视处理人民来信的错误

专栏：读者来信摘要

    我要改正不重视处理人民来信的错误
    中共粤北区委会陈欣来信：我是负责处理人民来信工作的。有一次区党委秘书长为了处理一件群众反映的对婚姻法的认识问题的来信，曾经几次修改我们起草的答复信。但我并没有深刻地认识到为什么要那样认真处理。读了一月十九日人民日报的社论“认真处理人民群众来信，大胆揭发官僚主义罪恶”后，我才感到自己在犯罪。我曾经因为人民来信日见减少了，而引以为幸。去年年底，翁源圩镇地方一商人写了很多控告信来，我即发生讨厌的情绪；我认为照转可以了。一月十九日人民日报的“各地各级人民政府应更加重视人民来信来访”一文指出的“没有建立必要的制度”、“互相推诿”、
    “草率处理”、“对待来访的群众，不是耐心热诚接待”等缺点，我对照了一下自己，都有。我的不负责所造成的危害真不堪设想。现在，我认识了我的错误。今后我一定要重视我的工作，改进我的工作，以弥补过去给党和人民所造下的损失。
