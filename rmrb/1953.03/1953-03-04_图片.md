The Chinese and Korean People's forces have launched large-scale propaganda work against the enemy on the front lines, coordinating with military strikes to disintegrate the enemy army. More and more soldiers of the Li puppet army are surrendering to us. The picture shows a front-line broadcaster of the Korean People's Army explaining to enemy soldiers our army's policy of leniency towards prisoners of war and preferential treatment for officers and soldiers who revolt and cross over.
