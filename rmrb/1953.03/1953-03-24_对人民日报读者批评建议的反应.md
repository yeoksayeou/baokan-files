Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Wucheng County People's Government Handles the Wheat Mold Incident in the County Grain Bureau

    A letter from the Wucheng County People's Government: The People's Daily published Comrade Wang Xingqi's letter on February 1 criticizing the wheat mold incident in our county's Grain Bureau. After our investigation, this criticism is entirely true. Zhang Yongji, the director of the Grain Bureau, has a serious bureaucratic work style, does not humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, cannot correctly solve the specific problems of cadres in their work, and does not pay attention to grain inspection work. He should bear the main responsibility for the wheat mold incident. More seriously, he does not accept the opinions of cadres and sells the moldy grain mixed with good grain, which has a very bad impact. It has been decided to give him a demerit. Deng Zhongmin, the head of the storage and transportation section of the Grain Bureau, was not in the office when this wheat mold accident occurred. Before being transferred for training, he discovered wheat worm damage and explained the handling method to the director, but he neglected storage and inspection work in his daily work, and should bear some responsibility for this accident. Tian Guangcun, the laboratory technician, became irresponsible in his work after the director did not accept his opinion to strengthen inspection work, which is also wrong. The above two people are ordered to make a self-criticism and correct their mistakes.

    Reply from the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce on the Examination of Hearing Aids

    A letter from the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on March 15 published a letter from Zhuang Mingshan requesting the bureau to quickly reply to the results of the examination of the hearing aid he invented. The inspection situation is now reported as follows: Zhuang Mingshan submitted an application to the former Central Bureau of Technology in October 1951 for the invention of a hearing aid. The structure and use of this medical device should be reviewed by the electrical engineering group and the medical group of the Invention Examination Committee. The medical group of the bureau was reviewed by member Zhong Huilan in June 1952 and ended in September; the electrical engineering group believes that the circuit description of the design is not specific. After this work was assigned to our bureau, our bureau asked Zhuang Mingshan to supplement the materials in November, and the electrical engineering group is now reviewing it. After receiving Zhuang Mingshan's letter on February 16 inquiring about the results of the review, our bureau replied on March 6 and urged the Examination Committee to expedite the review. The delay of this issue for so long, although there are objective reasons, should arouse our serious attention and we should strive to improve.

    Beijing Public Transport Company is Solving the Traffic Problems of Basic Construction Work Zones

    A letter from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Utilities Bureau: After we forwarded Comrade Niu Haonian's suggestion in the "Reader's Letters Special Page" on January 14 regarding the establishment of a station near the Chedaogou Village to the Public Transport Company for processing, we received a report from the Public Transport Company saying that they have sent personnel to inspect the Jingmen Line. The Institute of Technology Station is located at the south entrance of Chedaogou, and the distances between the stations from Huangzhuang to Zizhuyuan are appropriate, but the distance from Zizhuyuan to Xizhimen is relatively long. In order to solve the difficulty for workers in the construction site east of Zizhuyuan to take the bus into the city, they plan to add a station at the entrance of the Stone Factory. They are now contacting the Traffic Police Team, and they will set up the station after the Traffic Police Team agrees.

    The Public Transport Company also mentioned in the letter that they have begun to pay attention to solving the transportation problems of construction workers in the suburbs several months ago. For example, whenever it is a holiday for construction workers, they specially add the newest and largest special buses to travel between Beijing and the areas with the most construction workers in Shijingshan. In the future, they will continue to strengthen this work. However, the number of buses entering and leaving Fuxingmen is limited to eight due to the narrow road. This year, there are particularly many basic construction projects outside Fuxingmen, and the number of workers traveling on this road is estimated to be several times more than it is now. The passengers are already very crowded, and it will definitely be more difficult in the future. We will further study and resolve this issue.

    The Ministry of Culture and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Jointly Notify Major Regions to Organize Theater Troupes and Film Projection Teams to Go Deep into Construction Sites

    A letter from the Central Ministry of Culture: After seeing Comrade Li Xin's letter in the "Reader's Letters Special Page" on January 14 reflecting that "Construction Workers Urgently Demand Cultural Life," we immediately jointly studied the situation with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and on February 11 jointly notified the cultural departments (or cultural and educational departments) and trade union federations of major administrative regions, as well as the cultural bureaus and municipal trade union federations of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Taiyuan and other places, to organize theater troupes and film projection teams to various construction sites in a planned way in the future to meet the cultural needs of construction workers.

    The CPC Tai'an County Committee is Handling Zhang Fengshan's Illegal and Disciplinary Violations

    A letter from the Office of the CPC Tai'an Prefectural Committee in Shandong: After we saw the "Reader's Letters Special Page" in the People's Daily on December 6 last year published the letter "Some County and District Cadres in Shandong Province Seriously Suppress Mass Criticism," which mentioned that Zhao Jiazhu of Sunjia Village, 11th District, Tai'an County, accused Deputy Township Chief Zhang Fengshan of illegal and disciplinary violations and the issue has not been resolved for a long time, we immediately informed the CPC Tai'an County Committee to conduct an investigation and handling. According to the county's report: People have been sent to investigate Zhang Fengshan's illegal behavior, and it has been proven that the issues reflected by the informant are all facts. The matter is now being handled. A detailed report will be made later on the handling results.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    武城县人民政府处理该县粮食局小麦霉烂事件
    武城县人民政府来信：二月一日人民日报刊登了王兴起同志批评我县粮食局小麦霉烂的来信。经我们检查，这个批评完全属实。粮食局局长张永吉工作中官僚主义作风严重，不虚心听取群众意见，不能正确地解决干部工作中的具体问题，不重视粮食检查工作，对粮食霉烂事件应负主要责任。更严重的是，他不接受干部意见，把霉粮和好粮混在一起出卖，影响很坏。决定给予记过处分。粮食局储运股长邓仲民在这次小麦霉烂发生事故时不在机关，在调训前发现小麦虫蚀也曾向局长交代处理办法，但平日工作中轻视保管检查工作，对此次事故应负一定责任。化验员田光存因局长没接受他加强检查工作的意见后，对工作就不负责任，这也是不对的。以上两人责令检讨改正。
    中央工商行政管理局对审查助听器情况的答复
    中央工商行政管理局来信：三月十五日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载庄鸣山要求本局迅速答复审查他所发明的助听器结果的来信，现将检查情况函告如下：庄鸣山于一九五一年十月间呈报前中央技术管理局申请发明助听器一案，该项医疗器材的构造及使用两方面，应经发明审查委员会电机组及医药组两组审查。该局医药组于一九五二年六月间由锺惠澜委员审查，于九月间审查结束；电机组则认为该项设计电路说明不具体。该项工作划归本局后，本局又于十一月间请庄鸣山补充材料，现在电机组正审查中。我局接到庄鸣山二月十六日催询审查结果的信，已于三月六日复函，并督促审查委员会从速审查。这一问题迟延如此之久，虽有客观原因，但应引起我们严重注意，并努力改进。
    北京公共汽车公司正在解决基本建设工区的交通问题
    北京市人民政府公用局来信：一月十四日“读者来信专页”所载牛好年同志建议公共汽车公司在车道沟村附近设站的问题，经我们转公共汽车公司处理后，顷接汽车公司报告说，他们已派员前往京门线查勘，工学院站系设在车道沟南口，黄庄至紫竹院各站距离都很适当，惟紫竹院至西直门一段距离较远。为了解决紫竹院以东工地工人进城乘车的困难，他们拟在石子厂门口增设一站。现在他们正在同交通队进行联系，经交通队同意后，他们就前往设站。
    汽车公司在来信中还谈到，他们对郊区建筑工人的交通问题，数月前已经开始注意解决，如每当建筑工人休假日，他们都特别加放最新最大的专车，来往于北京至石景山之间建筑工人最多的地区。今后他们还要继续加强这项工作。但进出复兴门的车数，由于道路狭窄，被限制为八辆。而今年复兴门外的基本建设工程特别多，来往在这条路上的工人，估计会比现在多几倍，目前乘客已经十分拥挤，今后一定更加困难。关于这个问题，我们将进一步研究解决办法。
    文化部和全总联合通知各大区组织剧团放映队深入建筑工地
    中央文化部来信：看到一月十四日“读者来信专页”所载黎欣同志反映“建筑工人迫切要求文化生活”的来信后，我们和中华全国总工会当即共同研究了这方面的情况，并于二月十一日联合通知各大行政区文化部（或文教部）和总工会，以及北京、天津、上海、汉口、广州、沈阳、太原等地人民政府文化局、市总工会，要他们今后有计划地组织剧团和放映队等分赴各建筑工地演出，藉以满足建筑工人在文化生活方面的要求。
    中共泰安县委正在处理张凤山违法乱纪问题
    中共山东泰安地委办公室来信：我们看到去年十二月六日人民日报“读者来信专页”刊登“山东省某些县区干部严重压制群众批评”信中，提到泰安县十一区孙家村赵加柱控告副乡长张凤山违法乱纪问题长期未得解决一事，立即函告中共泰安县委进行调查处理。现据该县报告：已派人将张凤山违法行为调查清楚，证明检举人反映的问题均系事实，现正进行处理。处理结果待后再作详细报告。
