Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers:
	I am Liu Yushun, the father of the combat hero and martyr Liu Xingwen of the Chinese People's Volunteers. I am a Miao person and live in Nayong County, Guizhou Province. Today is the Spring Festival, and I am very happy, so I especially want to share a few heartfelt words with you.

	When Xingwen returned to China the year before last in November, the provincial chairman sent someone to pick me up and take me to Guiyang to see him. I was very happy to see Xingwen. I never thought that this child who used to herd cattle for the landlords would become a people's hero today. This is truly thanks to Chairman Mao! At that time, Xingwen said to me: "Father, when you return to the village, you must work with the poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out land reform and overthrow the landlords. You must also help the families of soldiers who do not have labor power with their work. As a soldier's family member and the father of a combat hero, you must play a model role, take the lead in labor, and not rely on government relief."

	After returning to the village, I actively participated in land reform and struggled against the landlords and bullies. My family of eleven was allocated land that can yield 3,600 catties of grain per year. Last year, I responded to the government's call and was the first to join the mutual aid team. Li Meimei in the village is a military dependent and does not have a major labor force. Although she is not in my group, I helped her plow the fields for three days. The villagers said, "The mutual aid team is really good. Everyone helps each other. With more people, there is more strength, and more work can be done." Later, many people joined the mutual aid team. Last year, Nayong County was short of rain, and the crops were dry. The People's Government called on us to fight the drought, so I mobilized everyone to dig twelve ditches and three sinkholes to divert water for irrigation, so that the crops did not suffer much damage.

	Last September, I heard that Xingwen had gloriously sacrificed on the front lines in Korea. Xingwen was my only son, and I was of course very sad, but I did not shed tears. My Xingwen died for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. He died fighting the American devils, and his death was glorious. The Chinese people know him, the Korean people know him, and the men, women, old, and young in Nayong County know him. The county even held a memorial meeting attended by more than 3,000 people. My Xingwen's body died, but his spirit will not die, and I have not relaxed.

	I am Xingwen's father, and I want to avenge Xingwen. I will work hard to increase production and pay more public grain to support the Volunteers in fighting the American devils. Last year, my family increased production by five dou of corn, seven dou of potatoes, and two dou of buckwheat. I remembered Xingwen's words, and I cannot rely on the government's care. I also help others. When Tian Wenchang, Wang Shaoqin, and military dependent Li Meimei in our village had some temporary difficulties in paying public grain, I took out Xingwen's bereavement pension that I had not yet used and lent it to them. I traveled more than fifty miles, crossed two mountains, and paid the public grain for them. I am the father of the combat hero Liu Xingwen, and I should do this.

	Last year, everyone rated me as a third-class labor model in Nayong County, invited me to the county to attend a meeting, invited me to speak, and awarded me fifty catties of fried dough cakes and three hoes. In the future, I must maintain my glory and continue to work hard to produce.

	After Xingwen's sacrifice, the People's Government was very concerned about me. Comrades from the work team and County Magistrate Wang often came to ask me if I had any difficulties or lacked anything. Last winter, the Nayong County People's Government made me a cotton-padded coat and gave me five pieces of blue cloth. The Bijie Prefectural Commissioner's Office made me a set of cotton clothes and gave me two large bolts of blue cloth. The Bijie Military Sub-district also gave me two cotton quilts. Both my mother and I eat well and dress warmly. This Spring Festival, the Nayong County People's Government sent another 300 catties of rice, and the Bijie Prefectural Commissioner's Office sent me another 100 catties of salt and four pieces of white cloth. This January, the third sub-group of the delegation to Korea came to Bijie and gave me a corn threshing machine and one zhang of indigo cloth. The farm also gave me a yellow cow. I am truly grateful.

	Not only is the People's Government concerned about me, but the people of the whole country are concerned about me. After Xingwen's sacrifice, people from Beijing wrote to me, people from various counties in Guizhou wrote to me, and people from Chongqing, Tibet, and Xikang wrote to me. I received a total of 330 letters. The people who wrote to me included workers, farmers, young children, students, and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteers. They all comforted me and encouraged me. My heart is always warm. I lost a son, but I have received the care of the people of the whole country. There is truly endless glory.

	This glory belongs to my Xingwen, to our Miao people, and to the comrades of the Volunteers. This glory belongs even more to Chairman Mao. If Chairman Mao had not come, our Miao people would not have been able to turn over; if my Xingwen had not been in Chairman Mao's army, he would not have become a hero. I thank the people of the whole country, and I thank Chairman Mao even more.

	I must live up to the concern of the people of the whole country for me, live up to the concern of the Volunteer comrades for me, and even more live up to Chairman Mao. I will always follow the Communist Party, and I will take the lead in doing whatever the People's Government calls for. This year, I plan to increase production by another five dou of corn and five dou of potatoes compared to last year, and do my best to run the mutual aid team well. I will also send Xingwen's nine-year-old younger sister to school, so that she can grow up to learn from her brother and serve the people well.

	I hope that the Volunteer comrades will all learn from Liu Xingwen, avenge Liu Xingwen, fiercely fight the American devils, and protect the people of the whole country so that they can live a good life.

### 刘兴文烈士的父亲刘玉顺春节写给志愿军的一封信

    刘兴文烈士的父亲刘玉顺春节写给志愿军的一封信中国人民志愿军同志们：
    我是志愿军战斗英雄刘兴文烈士的父亲。我是苗族人，住在贵州省纳雍县。今天过春节，我很欢喜，特地跟你们谈几句心头话。
    前年十一月兴文回国时，省主席派人来接我到贵阳看他。我见到兴文时高兴得很，想不到过去这个跟地主放牛的孩子，今天成了人民的英雄。真是托毛主席的福啊。当时兴文对我说：“父亲，你回到村里要和贫雇农在一道搞土地改革，把地主斗垮。还要帮助没有劳动力的军人家属做活路。你是军人家属，你是战斗英雄的父亲，更要起模范作用，带头劳动，不要依靠政府的救济。”
    回到村里，我就积极参加土地改革，斗争了地主恶霸，我全家十一口人，分到了每年可收三千六百斤粮食的土地。去年，我响应政府的号召，首先参加了互助组。寨里的李么妹是军属，没有主要劳动力，她虽然不在我组，但我也帮她犁了三天的地。老乡们说：“互助组真好，大家互相帮助，人多力量大，活路做得多。”以后，就有很多人参加了互助组。去年，我们纳雍县缺雨，庄稼旱了，人民政府号召我们抗旱，我就发动大家掏了十二道水沟，挖了三个海眼，引水浇地，使庄稼没有受到什么损失。
    去年九月间，我听到兴文在朝鲜前线光荣牺牲了。兴文是我的独子，我当然很难过，可是我没有掉泪。我的兴文是为抗美援朝保家卫国死的，是打美国鬼子死的，死得光荣。中国人民知道他，朝鲜人民知道他，纳雍县的男女老少都知道他，县里还开了三千多人参加的追悼大会。我家兴文人死精神不死，我没有松气。
    我是兴文的父亲，我要为兴文报仇。我就用劲增加生产，多缴公粮支援志愿军打美国鬼子。去年我家增产了五斗苞谷、七斗洋芋和二斗荞麦。我记住了兴文的话，我不能依靠政府的照顾，我还帮助别人。我们寨里的田文昌、王绍钦和军属李么妹，在交公粮的时候，暂时有些困难，我就拿出还没有用完的兴文的抚恤金借给他们，走了五十多里路，翻了两座大山，替他们交了公粮。我是战斗英雄刘兴文的父亲，我应该这样做。
    去年，大家评我为纳雍县的三等劳动模范，请我到县里去开会，请我讲话，奖给我油饼五十斤和锄头三把。今后我一定要保持光荣，继续努力生产。
    兴文牺牲后，人民政府十分关心我，工作组的同志和王县长都常来问我有那样困难，缺那样，少那样。去年冬天，纳雍县人民政府给我做了一件棉大衣，送给我五件蓝布；毕节专员公署给我做了一套棉衣，又送给我两大匹蓝布；毕节军分区也送给我两条棉被。我和兴文的母亲都吃得好穿得暖。今年春节，纳雍县人民政府又送来三百斤大米，毕节专员公署又送给我一百斤盐巴，四件白布。今年一月，赴朝慰问团第三分团到毕节，送给我一架打苞谷的机器和一丈板青布，农场又送给我一头黄牛。我心里真是万分感激。
    不光是人民政府在关心我，全国人民都在关心我。兴文牺牲后北京人民给我来信，贵州各县的人民给我来信，重庆、西藏和西康都有人给我来信。我一共收到了三百三十封信。写信给我的有工人，有农民，有小娃娃，有学生，也有解放军和志愿军的指战员。他们都安慰我，鼓励我。我的心头总是热烘烘的。我失掉了一个儿子，但是我得到了全国人民的关心。真有说不尽的光荣。
    这光荣是我兴文的，是我们苗家的，也是志愿军同志们的。这光荣更是毛主席的。要不是毛主席来了，我们苗家也不能翻身；要不是在毛主席的队伍里，我家兴文也不能成英雄。我感谢全国人民，更感谢毛主席。
    我一定要对得起全国人民对我的关心，对得起志愿军同志对我的关心，更要对得起毛主席。我要永远跟着共产党走，人民政府号召做那样，我就带头做那样。今年，我打算比去年再增产五斗苞谷、五斗洋芋，尽力把互助组搞好。我还要把兴文的九岁的小妹妹送去读书，让她长大了学习她哥哥，好好为人民服务。
    我希望志愿军同志们都要学习刘兴文，为刘兴文报仇，狠狠地打美国鬼子，保卫全国老百姓过好日子。　刘玉顺
    一九五三年二月十四日
