Former Director of the Finance Department of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, Jin Chongzhi, Severely Violated Financial Discipline and was Demoted

Following the exposure in this newspaper on August 29th of last year regarding the serious violations of financial discipline by the Finance Department of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government immediately conducted a thorough investigation, and those who committed errors made self-criticisms. The North China Administrative Committee and the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council put forward their opinions on how to handle the matter, which were approved by the Government Administration Council on January 24th of this year. Jin Chongzhi, the former Director of the Provincial Finance Department, has been demoted.

Beginning in 1950, under the leadership of Jin Chongzhi, the Finance Department of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government engaged in false reporting, fraudulent claims, hiding funds, and setting up secret accounts, seriously violating national financial discipline. In 1950 alone, the department falsely reported 23.7 billion yuan in final accounts and hid 16.8 billion yuan over the years. In 1951, the department emphasized local difficulties and requested the Central Ministry of Finance to allocate 28.8 million catties of millet, but the amount was never used and was falsely reported in the final accounts.

Not only did Jin Chongzhi fail to deeply examine these errors during the "Three-Anti" campaign, but he continued to set up secret accounts and make false entries after the "Three-Anti" campaign. It was only after the inspection team from the Finance Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee investigated and verified the situation that they were forced to abolish the secret accounts and false entries. Only then did Jin Chongzhi make a relatively profound self-criticism.

In his self-criticism, Jin Chongzhi analyzed the severity of these errors, saying: First, disregarding the overall interests of the state and simply emphasizing local interests, drawing circles in finance, engaging in independence, and causing unnecessary losses to state finances. Second, knowingly violating the law and failing to set an example in implementing the national financial system, but instead taking the lead in undermining the national financial system, resulting in a chaotic state of the financial system and causing great political losses. Third, these errors were not consciously corrected for a long time, and were not even awakened during the "Three-Anti" campaign, and no more thorough examination or self-criticism was made until the end of the campaign. This error, as pointed out in the People's Daily's "Brief Review of Economic Work," "has developed to the point of lawlessness."

Why did these serious errors occur? In analyzing the causes of the errors, Jin Chongzhi pointed out: "First of all, there is serious localism and departmentalism in thinking, and a lack of a national overall concept. Due to long-term work in a guerrilla environment, an informal and undisciplined 'independent small kingdom' mentality has been developed unconsciously. Insufficient attention is paid to learning, and politically one is not strong and sharp enough. There is insufficient understanding of the new situation of centralization and unification after the victory of the revolution, and there is a lingering old concept of decentralized management from the rural base areas. Therefore, consideration of problems often starts simply from local interests, one-sidedly emphasizing 'Suiyuan is poor, has many difficulties, and is a multi-ethnic area, and should be given special consideration,' and never considers or rarely considers the difficulties of the central government and the overall interests of the state. This practice of emphasizing local interests will inevitably violate and hinder central unity and damage national interests. Secondly, there is a lack of sufficient vigilance and resistance to the erosion of bourgeois ideology. After entering the city, it was felt that the revolution had already been victorious and that one should no longer live the hard life of the past in the mountains. Therefore, unscrupulous means were used to 'accumulate' and enrich the family's financial resources in order to 'dynamically' solve local expenditures. Again, serious bureaucratism exacerbated my mistakes. I did not personally check my own wrongdoings in the "Three-Anti" campaign and overcome them in time. This shows that departmentalism and bureaucratic style are extremely serious. For the past two years, the Suiyuan Provincial Finance Department's financial situation was never thoroughly checked until June of last year, and there were only estimated figures for revenue and expenditure, not actual figures. This kind of bureaucratism inevitably prevents the errors from being checked out, and will inevitably lead to more serious errors."

    绥远省人民政府前财政厅厅长靳崇智
    严重违反财政纪律受到降职处分
    绥远省人民政府财政厅严重违反财政纪律的行为，经本报在去年八月二十九日揭发后，绥远省人民政府当即进行了深入的检查，犯了错误的人员都进行了检讨。政务院华北行政委员会、人民监察委员会根据检查和检讨材料，提出处理意见，并于今年一月二十四日经政务院批准。该省财政厅前任厅长靳崇智已受到降职处分。
    绥远省人民政府财政厅从一九五○年开始，在厅长靳崇智主持下，虚报，冒领，打埋伏，设小柜，严重地违反了国家财政纪律。该厅仅在一九五○年就虚报决算二百三十七亿元，历年打埋伏一百六十八亿元。一九五一年该厅强调地方困难，请求中央财政部拨给二千八百八十万斤小米，但未开支，就虚报了决算。
    靳崇智不仅没有在“三反”运动中深刻检讨这些错误，反而在“三反”运动后继续设立小柜和假账。直到华北行政委员会财政局派检查组查明以后，他们才被迫取消了小柜和假账。靳崇智才作了比较深刻的检讨。
    靳崇智在检讨中分析这一错误的严重性时说：第一，不顾国家整体利益，单纯强调局部利益，在财政上划了圈子，闹独立性，造成国家财政上不应有的损失。第二，知法犯法，不能以身作则地执行国家财政制度，反而带头破坏了国家财政制度，结果上行下效，使财政制度陷于混乱状态，政治上造成极大损失。第三，这些错误长期未能自觉地加以改正，甚至在“三反”运动中还没有惊醒，直到运动结束，始终没有作过较为彻底的检查与检讨。这一错误正如人民日报“经济工作简评”中所指出的，“已经发展到无法无天的地步”。
    为什么会造成这种严重的错误呢？靳崇智在分析错误的原因时指出：“首先是在思想上存在着严重的地方主义和本位主义，缺乏国家整体观念。由于长期在游击环境中工作，无形中养成一种自由散漫的‘独立小天下’的思想，不重视学习，在政治上不够坚强锐敏。对于革命胜利后集中统一的新形势认识不足，存在着农村根据地时期那种分散经营的旧观念。因此，考虑问题往往单纯地从地方利益出发，片面地强调‘绥远穷，困难多，又是多民族地区，应该特殊照顾’，从来不考虑或很少考虑中央的困难与国家整体利益。这种强调地方利益的作法，必然会违背和妨害中央统一，损害国家利益。其次，对资产阶级思想的侵蚀缺乏足够的警惕和抵抗。入城后，认为革命已经胜利，再不应过以往山头上那种艰苦生活，因此就不择手段地进行‘积累’，充实家底，以便‘机动’地解决地方开支。再次，严重的官僚主义加重了自己的错误。对自己错误行为，在‘三反’运动中不亲自动手检查，及时克服。这说明本位主义思想和官僚主义作风已极严重。两年来绥远省财政厅的家底，在去年六月以前，始终没有督促认真核算一下，对收支情况，只有估计数字而无确实数字。这种官僚主义就必然不能把错误检查出来，也就必然造成更严重错误”。
