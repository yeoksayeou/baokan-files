To the Editors: On January 25th and February 3rd, serious accidents involving the collapse of shantytowns occurred at basic construction sites in the Central South Region, resulting in heavy casualties among workers. This is a problem that deserves serious attention.

On February 3rd, a shantytown collapsed at the Baguazui construction site of the Huangshi City Second Work Zone of the Central South Steel Bureau Engineering Company Preparatory Office, causing a major accident that killed five workers, seriously injured ten, and slightly injured sixty-seven. This shantytown was newly built in October of last year and was of very poor quality. The shantytown was two stories high, with dormitories upstairs and workshops downstairs. The roof was covered with more than 4,000 tiles, weighing about seven tons. The dormitory housed 150 workers, and with tools and other items, the total weight was more than 20 tons. However, the foundation of the shantytown was only five *cun* deep (approximately 6.5 inches), and the foundation was loose soil. The pillars were also small, only eight centimeters thick each. The joints of the roof trusses were only nailed together with 3.5 to 4.5 *cun* nails, without being clamped with iron strips and tightened with screws. Therefore, the shantytown was very unstable, and the building creaked and swayed when people went up and down the stairs. The workers repeatedly raised suggestions for improvement, but they did not receive attention from the leadership. For example, during construction, workers suggested deepening the foundation and installing cross braces, but the foreman, Xiang Qingshan, did not adopt the workers' suggestions. After the shantytown was built, the workers suggested to the work zone director, Miao Shuhe, and the construction site director, Sun Dianxing, that "the shantytown is top-heavy and prone to collapse in strong winds, it's best to add more pillars," but this was not resolved either. Because it was dangerous to live in such a shantytown, many workers were afraid to sleep there and went to find their own housing several *li* away. Although the construction site leaders were aware of this serious situation, they did not take timely measures to solve it. Instead of emphasizing "objective" reasons, they asked the workers to "overcome difficulties" themselves, and even took a bad attitude of suppressing workers who made suggestions. In January of this year, a batch of construction workers was transferred from the Central China Steel Company. After they raised concerns about the shantytown, the construction site instructor, Zhao Chunxiu, said to them: "Workers from the countryside are satisfied with living in temples and sleeping on damp ground, it's just that the workers from Huagang are mischievous!"

Another shantytown collapse accident occurred at the Changsha Hongshan Temple construction site of the Second Engineering Office of the Logistics Department of the Hunan Military Region. The time was January 25th. This accident injured a total of 75 workers, including 12 seriously injured, three of whom may be disabled. This shantytown was built on a mountain ridge, with three-quarters of the foundation being loose soil, and the roof was covered with very heavy tiles. During construction, many workers disagreed with this approach and put forward concrete suggestions, selecting suitable foundations, but the leadership did not accept them. Because they mistakenly believed that "the shantytown is temporary and should be economical." Therefore, in the construction of the shantytown, there was "economy" everywhere, and inferior materials were used where good materials should have been used, and even bamboo sticks were used instead of nails when nailing the roof frame. As a result, the shantytown collapsed during strong winds on the evening of January 25th.

From these two accidents, it can be seen that the leading cadres of the Baguazui construction site of the Huangshi City Second Work Zone of the Central South Steel Bureau Engineering Company Preparatory Office, and the Changsha Hongshan Temple construction site of the Second Engineering Office of the Logistics Department of the Hunan Military Region, have a serious bureaucratic work style of disregarding the safety of workers' lives. They do not care about the lives of basic construction workers, and have taken a very frivolous attitude in solving the housing problem. The quality of the shantytowns does not meet safety standards, and after the workers made suggestions, they did not try to improve them, which is very wrong. We suggest that the relevant leaders thoroughly investigate and deal with these two incidents.

### 八卦嘴、洪山庙两工地发生工棚倒塌事故

    八卦嘴、洪山庙两工地发生工棚倒塌事故
    编辑同志：一月二十五日和二月三日，中南区发生了两次基本建设工地工棚倒塌、工人死伤惨重的严重事故。这是一个十分值得注意的问题。
    二月三日，中南钢铁局工程公司筹备处黄石市第二工区八卦嘴工地的工棚倒塌，造成压死工人五人，重伤十人，轻伤六十七人的重大事故。这所工棚是去年十月间新修建的，质量十分恶劣。工棚是两层的，上面是宿舍，下面是工房。屋顶盖瓦四千多块，约七吨重，宿舍里住了一百五十个工人，加上工具等，总共有二十多吨重。但工棚地脚基础只有五公寸深，而且地基是松土；支柱又小，每根柱子只有八公分粗；屋架八字梁的接头处只用了三寸半到四寸半的钉子钉在一起，并没有用铁条夹住再用螺丝钉扭紧。因此，工棚很不牢固，上下楼时房屋摇幌得吱吱作响。对于这种情况，工人们曾多次提出改进意见，但没有引起领导上的重视。如在修建时，工人曾建议把地脚打深些，并且安装十字架；但监工项青山不采纳工人意见。工棚盖好以后，工人们又向工区主任缪书和、工地主任孙典兴提出“工棚上重下轻，起大风容易倒，最好多加几根支柱”的意见；也没有得到解决。因为住这样的工棚很危险，许多工人不敢在里面睡觉，而到几里路以外的地方自己找房子住。这种严重的情况，工地领导方面虽然知道，还是没有及时设法解决，他们不是强调“客观”原因，就是要工人自己“克服困难”，甚至对提意见的工人采取打击的恶劣态度。今年一月，从华中钢铁公司调来一批建筑工人，他们对工棚提出意见后，工地指导员赵春修却对他们说：“农村来的工人，住野庙、睡湿地都很满足，就是华钢的工人调皮！”
    另一件工棚倒塌的事故，发生在湖南军区后勤部第二工程处长沙洪山庙工地上。时间是一月二十五日。这次事故共压伤工人七十五名，其中重伤十二人，有三人可能残废。这所工棚建筑在一个山嘴上，地基有四分之三都是松土，屋顶上盖了很重的瓦。在修建时，许多工人都不同意这种做法，并且提出了具体建议，选择了适当的地基，但是领导方面不接受。因为他们错误地认为“工棚是临时的，应该节约”。于是在修建工棚的工程中就处处“节约”，应该用好料的地方却用次料，甚至钉房架时也以竹签子代替钉子。因此在一月二十五日晚刮大风时工棚倒塌。
    从这两次事故中可以看出，中南钢铁局工程公司筹备处黄石市第二工区八卦嘴工地和湖南军区后勤部第二工程处长沙洪山庙工地领导干部，存在着严重的漠视工人生命安全的官僚主义作风。他们不关心基本建设工人的生活，在解决住宿问题上采取了十分轻率的态度，工棚质量不合安全标准，工人提出意见后又没有设法改进，这是十分错误的。我们建议有关领导方面彻底检查和处理这两个事件。
