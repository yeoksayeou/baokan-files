Letter from the General Office of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government
    Raising Difficulties Encountered in Handling People's Letters

    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published the editorial "Seriously Handle Letters from the People and Boldly Expose Bureaucratic Crimes" on January 19, we sent letters to the people's governments of various provinces and cities, requesting them to inform us of the difficulties and solutions in handling the work of people's letters, in order to exchange information and experience. We have now received replies from many provinces and cities. The problems mentioned in the letter from the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, such as the small number of people and the heavy workload, are universal. It is hoped that the leading organs of various places, especially the special responsible organs, will continue to conduct practical research, and inform us of the specific problems and research results in letters, so as to exchange information. The following is a letter from the Shanxi Provincial People's Government.

    To the People's Daily Editorial Department:
    We received your letter of January 22nd on January 25th, asking our office to inform you of the difficulties encountered in handling people's letters and visits, as well as the solutions and unresolved issues. A brief description is as follows:
      (1) The organizational structure of the people's inquiry offices at all levels is unsound. At present, they are in a state of having few people and heavy workload, and being unfamiliar with the business. There are a total of 109 units in various cities, special districts, counties, and towns in the province. According to incomplete statistics from 91 units in five special districts of Linfen, Yuncheng, Yuci, Xinxian, and Yanbei, although 73 units have established people's inquiry offices, many units have not yet been equipped with full-time cadres. According to incomplete statistics from the three special districts of Linfen, Yuci, and Xinxian, only 37 units have full-time cadres, accounting for about two-thirds of the three special districts. The cadres in the remaining units are still part-time. In some special districts, even the vast majority of cadres are part-time. For example, in Yanbei Special District, it is all handled concurrently by the Civil Affairs Section, the People's Supervision Office, and the Standing Committee of the County People's Congress; in Yuncheng Special District, some counties are handled concurrently by the secretary, the announcer, and the dispatcher; in Linfen Special District, some counties are handled concurrently by the cultural center. In particular, some counties have frequent transfers of cadres from the people's inquiry offices. For example, Dingxiang County transferred away the full-time cadres who had just been assigned, and Yangqu County transferred the assigned full-time cadres to the Judicial Reform Committee to assist in their work. Although the above situation has been corrected through inspection and assistance, it has not been completely resolved due to the lack of special establishment for the people's inquiry offices at all levels, and because some leading cadres have not paid enough attention to this work, which has affected the development and improvement of the work of handling people's letters.
    (2) Over the past year, the number of letters and visits from the people has gradually increased, and the handling methods in various places have also been continuously improved. For example, drafting, forwarding cases, and writing letters to urge handling have been improved to using cards for those who forward the cases, using reminder notices when urging handling, and establishing close contact with provincial-level departments, so that people's letters can be handled promptly by dedicated personnel. The registration work has also been simplified. This has improved work efficiency. According to statistics from the People's Inquiry Office of the Provincial People's Government, more than 80% of the issues raised in letters and visits from the people in 1952 have been handled. The 103 unresolved cases (including 48 from the Provincial People's Supervision Commission, 12 from the Public Security Department, 7 from the Provincial People's Procuratorate, 13 from the Civil Affairs Department, 18 from the Provincial People's Court, and 5 from the Inquiry Office) have been transferred to the special districts and counties in a timely manner, and urged several times, but because the problems are more complicated, most of them require specialized investigation and research, and the special districts and counties lack cadres, and the provincial level cannot send people down to inspect and assist in all cases, so no results have been obtained for a long time.
    (3) In receiving people's visits, various places often encounter necessary expenses that cannot be resolved, such as the need to subsidize visitors' travel expenses or provide them with a meal. The expenditure of this fund has only been resolved by the People's Inquiry Office of the Provincial People's Government after the "Zhang Shunyou incident." The cities, special districts, and counties have not yet resolved it, so there is no way to deal with some special expenses. For example, Sun Xianzhang of Ningwu County invented a harvester and asked the County People's Government to help with travel expenses to Taiyuan to find the Provincial People's Government's Industry Department to study the trial production. Although the county gave him 36,500 yuan, it could not be used, and finally asked the Provincial People's Government to solve it.
    The first two problems mentioned above have been investigated and studied, and at the recent mass letter and visit work conference held by the Provincial Party Committee, it was emphasized that all levels should quickly improve the organization and select full-time cadres to carry out this work. Problems that have not been resolved for a long time can be gradually reduced by frequent inspection and urging, and by exchanging experiences with various departments. The third problem is that we are now preparing to compile a budget for mass letter service fees and ask for approval to solve the difficulties.

### 山西省人民政府办公厅来信提出在处理人民来信中感到的困难

    山西省人民政府办公厅来信
    提出在处理人民来信中感到的困难
    编者按：本报在一月十九日发表“认真处理人民群众来信、大胆揭发官僚主义罪恶”的社论之后，曾经向各省市人民政府发信，要求将处理人民来信工作中的困难和解决的办法告诉我们，以便交流情况与经验。现在我们已收到许多省、市的回信。山西省人民政府来信中所提到的人少事繁等问题，具有普遍性。希望各地领导机关特别是专责机关都能继续作切实的研究，并将具体的问题和研究的结果来信告知，以便交流。下面是山西省人民政府的来信。人民日报编辑部：
    一月二十五日接到你们一月二十二日来函，让我厅将在处理人民来信工作中遇到的困难以及解决的办法和未解决的问题告知你们。现简述如下：
      （一）各级人民问事处的组织机构不健全，目前处于人少事繁，业务生疏的状态。全省各市、专、县、镇共一百零九个单位，据临汾、运城、榆次、忻县、雁北五个专区九十一个单位的不完全材料统计，虽然已有七十三个单位建立了人民问事处，但有不少单位还未配备专职干部。据临汾、榆次、忻县三个专区不完全统计，有专职干部的只有三十七个单位，约占三个专区的三分之二，其余单位的干部仍是兼职。有些专区甚至绝大部分干部是兼职，如雁北专区都是由民政科、人民监察处、县各界人民代表会议常务委员会兼办；运城专区有些县是秘书干事、收音员、收发员兼办；临汾专区有些县是文化馆兼办。特别是有些县对人民问事处的干部调动频繁，如定襄县配备了专职干部不久又调走，阳曲县把配备的专职干部抽往司法改革委员会帮助工作。以上情形经检查帮助，虽有所纠正，但终因各级人民问事处无专门编制，又加有些领导干部对这
    一工作未予足够重视，致现在仍未彻底解决，影响了处理人民来信工作的开展与提高。
    （二）一年来，人民来信、来访逐渐增多，各地处理方法也在不断改进。如拟稿、转发案件、写信催办等，改进为转办者用卡片，催办时用催办通知书，并与省级各部门建立了密切联系，使人民来信均有专人及时处理。登记工作也简化了手续。这样就提高了工作效率。据省人民政府人民问事处统计，一九五二年人民来信、来访提出的问题，已处理百分之八十以上，未处理的一百零三件（计省人民监察委员会四十八件，公安厅十二件，省人民检察署七件，民政厅十三件，省人民法院十八件，问事处五件），据了解，各主办单位均已分别及时转到各专、县，并催办几次，但终因问题较复杂，多数需要专门调查研究，而各专、县缺乏干部，省级又不可能全部派人下去检查帮助，所以长时期没有得到处理结果。
    （三）在接见人民来访中，各地经常遇到些必要的开支而无法解决，如需要补助来访者路费，或需给来访者吃顿饭等。这笔经费的开支，除省人民政府人民问事处在“张顺有事件”后有所解决外，各市、专、县迄未解决，致遇到一些特殊开支便无办法。如宁武县孙宪章发明了收割机，要求县人民政府帮助路费到太原找省人民政府工业厅研究试制，该县虽给了他三万六千五百元，但无法开支，最后还是请示省人民政府解决。
    以上第一、二两问题已进行了调查研究，并在最近省委召开的群众来信、来访工作会议上，强调提出各级应迅速健全机构，抽出专职干部进行此项工作。较长时期未得处理结果的问题，在经常检查催办及与各部门交流经验中，当可逐渐减少。第三个问题，现正准备编造群众来信事业费预算，请示批准，以解决困难。
