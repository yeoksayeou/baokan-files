Agricultural Production Cooperatives Should Not Blindly Accumulate Public Property
Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the CCP Resolutely Corrects Left-Leaning Adventurist Tendencies

In early January, the Changzhi Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province convened a joint meeting of county committees and secretaries to examine and correct the blind and rash tendency of agricultural production cooperatives to accumulate public property too early and too much. This tendency became widespread during the development of new cooperatives in November of last year. Its main manifestation was the transfer of all or most of the members' livestock, farm implements, and sheep flocks to the cooperative, regardless of the needs and possibilities of production. Statistics show that among the 1,326 new and old cooperatives in the entire region, those that transferred all livestock, sheep flocks, and farm implements to the cooperative accounted for 35.4 percent, and those that transferred a portion accounted for 42 percent. These means of production were generally transferred to the cooperative using two methods: one was valuation and repayment in installments, with some paying interest during the repayment period and others not; the other was valuation for balancing purposes, with adjustments made for surpluses and deficits, without repayment or interest, thus becoming the public property of the cooperative.

The majority of agricultural production cooperatives adopted methods of coercion and command to accumulate public property. Wei Genwang, the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary of Xiahao Village in the Second District of Wuxiang, in order to pursue a new cooperative that surpassed the Wang Jinyun Agricultural Production Cooperative, used a set of disguised coercive methods from inside the cooperative to outside, from within the Party to outside the Party, forcing cooperative members to transfer all their means of production to the cooperative. Their slogan was: "Surround layer by layer, attack from inside and outside, contract for everything, achieve success overnight." As a result, one hundred and sixty sheep belonging to the members were seized into the cooperative overnight. The members were extremely dissatisfied with this situation, saying, "It's like struggle! We can't live!" Seeing the unfavorable trend, people outside the cooperative sold seventy sheep.

The excessive and premature accumulation of public property by agricultural production cooperatives has already caused extremely bad effects.

1.  The cooperatives have huge debts that cannot be repaid. Many cooperatives have debts of around 20 million yuan. Individual cooperatives have even more debts. The Nanma Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lucheng (29 households) has a debt of 58 million yuan, with monthly interest of 3 percent, resulting in an annual interest of 18 million yuan. The cooperative has more than 300 mu of land, which can only yield 600 shi of coarse grain per year. To pay such a large amount of interest, half of the coarse grain would have to be used. As a result, the lives of the members and the production of the cooperative would be seriously affected. Some cooperatives have used the method of valuation for balancing purposes, without repayment or interest, to accumulate public property. Although this seems to result in less external debt, the result of balancing the valuation and adjusting for surpluses and deficits affects the interests of the wealthier households and harms the interests of the poor peasants. Because the wealthier households have a full set of carts and horses and sheep flocks, while the poor peasant households have none or very few, the result of the balancing is that the poor cannot afford it, and the rich do not get what they deserve, resulting in dissatisfaction for everyone.

2.  Although public property has been accumulated, there is no experience in management, resulting in huge losses. New cooperatives that have just developed from mutual aid teams have no way to manage dozens of livestock, a large pile of farm implements, and pigs and sheep. Due to poor management, losses of public property have occurred. The Zhao Tongshui Cooperative in Huguan tied eleven livestock of different temperaments, such as cattle, donkeys, and mules, to the same trough, causing them to kick and fight each other, and most of them became thin. The masses satirized, "The members are not of one mind, the livestock do not get along, that is the superiority of the cooperative!"

3.  Cadres are forced to focus their leadership on solving the management and valuation problems of livestock, sheep flocks, and farm implements, resulting in the relaxation or abandonment of leadership over current production. Many cooperatives only completed 50 percent of their production plans for the first quarter (Shanxi Province regards the winter of 1952 as the first quarter of the 1953 agricultural year). Many members of the Xiaopeng Village Cooperative in Lingchuan said dissatisfiedly, "A thousand good things, ten thousand good things, but without production, everything is nonsense!" The reason for the above deviations is that some county and district cadres, cooperative cadres, and activists one-sidedly believe that only by accumulating a large amount of public property can the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives be demonstrated.

The reason why this deviation can grow so universally is mainly because the leading organs of the special district did not have enough understanding and underestimated the eagerness and rashness of cadres when developing new cooperatives last winter. The leading authorities of the special district organized mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives to visit old cooperatives season by season to learn from the experience of establishing cooperatives, but did not make it clear to the mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives which experiences could be learned at the beginning of the establishment and which experiences could not be learned temporarily. This meant that the eagerness and rashness of the county, district, and village cadres were not effectively stopped when they first occurred.

At this meeting, the prefectural committee decided to take the following measures to correct this deviation:

1.  Convene meetings of agricultural production cooperative directors and cooperative establishment cadres at the county level to ascertain the situation, trace the causes, and strictly criticize the adventurist tendency on the basis of conducting criticism and self-criticism.

2.  Adhere to the policy of "active leadership, steady progress" in establishing cooperatives, and clearly stipulate that the public property of agricultural production cooperatives must be gradually accumulated from less to more under the principle of ensuring that the cooperative's production and members' income increase year by year. The transfer of means of production such as livestock, sheep flocks, and farm implements to the cooperative must meet the conditions of production needs, complete voluntariness of the members, and fair and reasonable valuation.

3.  For cooperatives where deviations have occurred, they should be handled in accordance with the above principles. Each cooperative should be examined individually, and specific treatment should be given according to the specific situation. In the case of cooperatives where a few cadres have forced the masses to blindly accumulate public property and are heavily indebted, cadres should be educated, and livestock, sheep flocks, farm implements, etc., should be returned to their original owners in whole or in part, entirely according to the opinions of the members. In the case of cooperatives where the majority of people voluntarily accumulate public property, members should not be forced to withdraw; however, members should be told the reasons why transferring means of production to the cooperative too early and too much is unfavorable to the cooperative and its members, and then they should be helped to return as much livestock, sheep flocks, farm implements, etc., as possible, according to production needs, reduce the cooperative's debt, and facilitate the development of production.

The meeting stipulated a system to prevent the recurrence of similar deviations. This system is: Regardless of whether it is a new or old cooperative, if the debt exceeds 5 million yuan in the current year, it must be discussed and approved by the district committee; if it exceeds 10 million yuan, it must be approved by the county committee; if it exceeds 50 million yuan, it must be approved by the prefectural committee. It was also emphasized that responsibility must be taken at each level, and strict control must be exercised in order to grasp the situation and proactively handle problems.

After the meeting, the county committees had made self-criticisms before February 18 and formulated specific measures to correct the deviations. Around February 23, each county generally convened a meeting of cooperative directors and cooperative establishment cadres. Around February 28, each county had begun to examine each cooperative one by one in actual work, solve problems, and mobilize each cooperative to enter spring plowing production. (Chen Guobao)

    农业生产合作社不能盲目积累公共财产
    中共长治地委坚决纠正左倾冒进的偏向
    中共山西长治地方委员会在一月上旬，召开所属各县县委、秘书联席会议，检查、纠正农业生产合作社过早过多地积累公共财产的盲目冒进偏向。这一偏向在去年十一月发展新社时普遍发生。它的主要表现是不顾生产的需要与可能，把社员的牲口、农具、羊群全部或大部归社。据统计全区一千三百二十六个新、老社中，把牲口、羊群、农具全部入社的占百分之三十五点四，部分入社的占百分之四十二。这些生产资料大致采用两种方法入社：一是作价入社，分期偿还，在未偿还期间，有的付息，有的不付息；一是作价平衡归社，多退少补，不偿还，不付息，成为社的公共财产。
    大部分农业生产合作社采取强迫命令的方法积累公共财产。武乡二区下郝村中共支部书记魏根旺为了追求一个超过王锦云农业生产合作社的新社，竟从社内到社外、党内到党外，采用了一套变相强迫命令的办法，迫使社员群众将生产资料全部入社。他们的口号是：“层层包围，内外夹攻，包干包打，一夜成功”。结果一夜之间，就把社员的一百六十只羊抓到社内。社员对这种情况极端不满，他们说：“斗争啦！不能过日子啦！”社外群众看见风头不对，卖出七十多只羊。
    农业生产合作社过多过早地积累公共财产，已经造成了极坏的影响。
    一、社内负债很大，无法偿还。许多社负债二千万元左右。个别社负债更多。潞城南马村农业生产合作社（二十九户），负债五千八百万元，以月息三分计息，年利一千八百万元。该社共三百多亩土地，一年仅能收六百石粗粮，要付这样一笔利息，就得拿出一半粗粮。结果社员的生活、社的生产都要受到严重的影响。有些用作价平衡入社，不偿还、不付息的办法来积累公共财产的社，看起来外债不大，但平衡作价、多退少补的结果，既影响了富裕户的利益，又伤害了贫农的利益。因为富裕户有全套车马、羊群，贫农户没有或者极少，平衡的结果是贫的出不起，富的得不到，结果大家都不满意。
    二、积累了公共财产，但不会经营管理，造成巨大损失。刚从互助组发展起来的没有管理公共财产经验的新合作社，根本无法解决几十头牲口、一大堆农具和猪羊的管理问题。因为管理不善，造成了公共财产的损失。壶关赵同水合作社把牛、驴、骡等十一头不同性格的牲口拴在一个槽上，互相踢打，大部分都瘦了。群众讽刺说：“社员不一心，牲口不合群，那就是社的优越性！”
    三、干部被迫把领导重心放在解决入社的牲口、羊群、农具的管理作价问题，结果放松或放弃了对当前生产的领导。许多合作社仅完成一季度（山西省以一九五二年的冬季作为一九五三年农业年度的第一季度）生产计划的百分之五十。陵川小怦村合作社许多社员不满意地说：“千好万好，没搞生产，好也扯淡！”发生以上偏向的原因，是部分县区干部、合作社的干部和积极分子片面地认为只有积累了大量的公共财产，才能显示农业生产合作社的优越性。
    这种偏向所以能够普遍滋长起来，主要是由于专区领导机关在去年冬季发展新社的时候，对干部中间存在的急躁冒进情绪认识不够，估计不足。专区领导方面曾组织准备办社的互助组逐季参观老的合作社，学习建社的经验，但没有向准备办社的互助组说清楚那些经验开始办社时就能学，那些经验暂时还不能学。这就使得县区村干部的急躁冒进情绪没有在刚刚发生的时候就得到有效的制止。
    在这次会议中，地委决定采取如下措施，纠正这一偏向：
    一、以县为单位召开农业生产合作社社长及办社干部会议，查明情况，追清原因，在开展批评和自我批评的基础上，严格批判冒进倾向。
    二、坚持“积极领导，稳步前进”的办社方针，明确规定：农业生产合作社的公共财产，必须在保证社内生产和社员收入逐年增加的原则下，由少而多地逐渐积累。凡牲口、羊群、农具等生产资料入社，必须具备生产需要，社员完全自愿，作价公平合理条件。
    三、对于发生偏向的合作社，基本上按上述原则处理。应逐社审查，分别具体情况，加以具体处理。凡少数干部强迫群众盲目积累公共财产而又负债巨大的社，应教育干部，完全依据社员意见，把牲口、羊群、农具等全部或部分归还原主。凡社内大多数人自愿积累公共财产的社，不要强迫社员硬行退出；但要向社员说清生产资料入社过早过多，对社和社员不利的道理，然后帮助他们根据生产需要，把不需要入社的牲口、羊群、农具等尽可能退出去，减少社的负债额，以利于发展生产。
    会议规定了一条制度，以防止再次发生类似偏向。这一制度是：无论新社老社，如当年负债额超过五百万元者，须经区委讨论批准；超过一千万元者，须经县委批准；超过五千万元者，须经地委批准。并强调必须层层负责，严格控制，以便于掌握情况，主动地处理问题。
    会后，各县委已于二月十八日前作了检讨，并拟定了纠正偏向的具体措施。二月二十三日前后，各县都普遍召开了一次社长及办社干部会议。二月二十八日前后，各县已在实际工作中，进行逐社审查，解决问题，发动各社进入春耕生产。  （陈国宝）
