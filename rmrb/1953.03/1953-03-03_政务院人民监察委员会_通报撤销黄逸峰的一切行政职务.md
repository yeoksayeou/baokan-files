    The People's Supervision Committee of the State Council
    Issues a Notice Revoking All Administrative Positions of Huang Yifeng
    (Xinhua News Agency, 2nd) The People's Supervision Committee of the State Council issued a notice regarding the serious suppression of democracy by Huang Yifeng, the former Minister of the East China Communications Department, and the revocation of all his administrative positions. The full text is as follows:
    Regarding the incident of Huang Yifeng, the former Minister of the Communications Department of the East China Military and Political Committee and concurrently Principal of the East China Transportation Technical School, suppressing criticism, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, after investigating the truth, published his criminal facts and Party disciplinary actions in the People's Daily on January 23rd. At the same time, it recommended that the East China Administrative Committee request the Central People's Government to revoke all administrative positions of Huang Yifeng. Based on the report from the East China Administrative Committee, the People's Supervision Committee of the State Council requested the State Council's approval to revoke all positions held by Huang Yifeng, including concurrent positions. On February 19, 1953, it replied to the East China Administrative Committee with document number (53) Zheng Ren Sun Zi 39, ordering them to implement it accordingly.
    The Huang Yifeng incident exposed that some leading cadres in our people's government organs still have serious bureaucratic and dictatorial work styles. As a result, democratic life has been severely suppressed, hindering the enthusiasm of the masses, damaging the connection between the people's government and the people, and harming the prestige of the people's government. We must wage an irreconcilable struggle against these vile anti-people behaviors. Leading organs and leading cadres at all levels should learn a lesson from the Huang Yifeng incident and earnestly improve their work style.

    政务院人民监察委员会
    通报撤销黄逸峰的一切行政职务
    【新华社二日讯】政务院人民监察委员会关于华东交通部部长黄逸峰严重压制民主撤销黄逸峰一切行政职务的通报。全文如下：
    原华东军政委员会交通部部长兼华东交通专科学校校长黄逸峰压制批评事件，中共中央华东局纪律检查委员会查明真象后，已于一月二十三日将其罪恶事实及党内处分刊载在人民日报；同时建议华东行政委员会呈请中央人民政府撤销黄逸峰的一切行政职务。政务院人民监察委员会根据华东行政委员会的报告，呈请政务院核准同意撤销黄逸峰本兼各职，并于一九五三年二月十九日以（53）政人孙字第三十九号文批复华东行政委员会令其查照执行在案。
    黄逸峰事件暴露了我们人民政府机关中某些领导干部，还存在着严重的官僚主义与独裁作风。因此，民主生活受到严重的压制，阻碍了群众的积极性，破坏了人民政府与人民群众的联系，损害了人民政府的威信。我们必须和这些恶劣的反人民的行为进行不调和的斗争。各级领导机关与领导干部，应当从黄逸峰事件中吸取教训，认真的改进工作作风。
