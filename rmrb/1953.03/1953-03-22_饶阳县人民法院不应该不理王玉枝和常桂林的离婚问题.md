    Raoyang County People's Court Should Not Ignore Wang Yuzhi and Chang Guilin's Divorce Issue
    Chen Shao-shang of the Zhaowuda League People's Court in Inner Mongolia writes: In May of last year, the woman Wang Yuzhi applied to the Zhaowuda League People's Court in Inner Mongolia for a divorce from her husband, Chang Guilin. Because Chang Guilin was in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, the Zhaowuda League People's Court wrote a letter in July of last year to the Raoyang County People's Court to inquire about Chang Guilin's situation and solicit his opinion on the divorce. The Raoyang County People's Court ignored it. Then Wang Yuzhi sent two telegrams to urge them, but there was no response. The Zhaowuda League People's Court sent two letters in November of last year to urge them, but after nearly half a year, there was still no response. We don't know the reason, and we ask the Raoyang County People's Court to investigate and reply.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    饶阳县人民法院不应该不理王玉枝和常桂林的离婚问题
    内蒙古昭乌达盟人民法院陈绍商来信：去年五月间，妇女王玉枝向内蒙古昭乌达盟人民法院申请和她丈夫常桂林离婚。因常桂林在河北省饶阳县，昭乌达盟人民法院于去年七月间去信请饶阳县人民法院了解常桂林的情况并征求他对离婚的意见。饶阳县人民法院不理。接着又由王玉枝打两次电报去催促，也不见回音。昭乌达盟人民法院于去年十一月间先后两次去信催促，一直拖了近半年仍然不见回音。我们不知是什么道理，请饶阳县人民法院检查答复。
