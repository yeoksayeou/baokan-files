I am Chen Chengdian, from Gongshan Village, Zhangshan District, Suxian County, Anhui Province. I am a middle peasant and a family member of a revolutionary martyr. I joined the revolutionary work in 1948. In 1952, when I was the chief of the "Financial Supply Section" in the "Baishan" Brigade of the Suixi County Huai River Project Headquarters, because the *Wanbei Daily* published my article "Jiang Huan, Engineer of the Suixi County Huai River Project Section, Made Design Errors and Suppressed Criticism" (see the February 28, 1952 issue of the newspaper, signed Chen Cheng), I was subjected to all kinds of persecution by Xie Ziyan, the head of Suixi County, and others. The day after the criticism article was published, on February 29th of last year, Xie Ziyan called me and asked me to "examine" my motives for writing the article. At the same time, District Head Xu Chuanyi (a corrupt element, whom I had reported during the Three-Anti Campaign) convened a meeting to criticize me, asking me "why I didn't go through the organization to write the article." I said that I had shown the article to Xiao Lin, the head of the engineering section. (Editor's note: Even if he hadn't shown it to him, it wouldn't be wrong.) I refused to admit my mistake. On March 4th, Xu Chuanyi received a letter from Xie Ziyan, saying that I should go to the Huai River Project Headquarters to "discuss the issue of writing the article." On March 5th, Comrade Xiao Lin and I went to the Huai River Project Headquarters together. After dinner, Xie Ziyan wanted me to go to Engineer Jiang Huan's office to "apologize," but I refused. Xie Ziyan angrily ordered the messenger to invite Engineer Jiang over, and also brought four other people. Under the chairmanship of Xie Ziyan, a meeting was held to criticize me. First, I was asked to talk about the motives and process of writing the article. After I talked about the errors in the engineering design (as published in the *Wanbei Daily*), Engineer Jiang also admitted the fact of suppressing criticism. Several people who came with Engineer Jiang criticized me for "lacking organization and discipline," and then asked me: "The design error was discovered in December 1951, why did you submit the article in February 1952?" Xie Ziyan then said that I "should examine myself" and rudely ordered me to "apologize to Jiang Huan" and "publicly examine myself in the newspaper." I said that we should go to the construction site to check the errors in the engineering design. Xie Ziyan then became furious, saying that I "looked down on the leadership, was arrogant, had a bad style of work, and lacked organization and discipline"; he ordered me to "write an examination to the newspaper within three days, and submit the examination to the Huai River Project Headquarters for review first"; and he forcibly detained me at the Huai River Project Headquarters. On March 6th, Xie Ziyan said the same thing to me again, and I still asked to go to the construction site to check the project and solicit the opinions of the laborers in the section. Xie Ziyan became furious again, saying that I "looked down on the leadership, was arrogant..." and so on. He loudly declared: "I will suppress criticism, I will suppress democracy! You can write an article and sue me in the newspaper!" He shouted for more than an hour. On March 8th, Xie Ziyan asked Comrade Zhou Bingheng to ask me to write an "examination" and showed me Xie's letter. The letter said: "This Chen Chengdian has a bad style of work, disregards his superiors, and is arrogant. He should be given a serious warning and ordered to write an examination within three days, which will be reviewed by the Huai River Project Headquarters and sent to the newspaper." I was very sad after suffering this series of blows, and I didn't eat anything for two days. But I remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that we must uphold the truth and adhere to the truth, and I remembered the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1950, and I mustered my courage again. I exposed Xie Ziyan's suppression of criticism and persecution of me to the *Wanbei Daily* under the title of "Adhere to the Truth and Continue the Struggle." On March 21st, I received a letter from the "Readers' Forum Group" of the *Wanbei Daily*. In addition to comforting me, the letter said: "We have sent a letter to the Political Department of the Huai River Project Committee, asking them to handle it." After that, there was no response. In mid-June of last year, Xie Ziyan further persecuted me. He used his power and, under the pretext of a meeting, convened an expanded meeting (called the "Key Examination Meeting") attended by more than 800 people, including cadres from ten districts and townships, heads of county-level organs directly under the county, the County People's Supervisory Committee, and the负责人 of the County Discipline Inspection Committee, to criticize me. At the beginning of the meeting, Xie Ziyan designated me to make a "self-examination" on the rostrum, and then everyone spoke. Seeing that not many people were speaking, Xie Ziyan mobilized three times, saying: "Don't worry, everyone, speak boldly. If Section Chief Chen (referring to me) dares to retaliate, I, the county head, will guarantee that he will be severely punished!" This criticism meeting lasted for one day and one night (with gas lamps), and the main content was to say that I was "arrogant, looked down on my superiors, wrote articles without going through my superiors, lacked organization and discipline, and refused to write an examination to the newspaper when the county head asked me to, and disobeyed the leadership," etc. The County Discipline Inspection Committee and the County People's Supervisory Committee have records of these. During the criticism, I was made to stand in the middle of the venue, not allowed to lower my head, and not allowed to lean my body on anything; I was not allowed to talk to anyone during meals, especially not allowed to be with Section Chief Zhou and Section Chief Xiao (because they agreed with me). After this criticism meeting, Xie Ziyan was still not satisfied. In July of last year, Xie Ziyan found me again and said: "The last examination didn't educate you much. I'm temporarily transferring you to the Huai River Project Headquarters to study, and I won't determine your work for the time being." In reality, it was to suspend me from my job and reflect on myself. Because I suffered too much, my nerves were a little out of order. I think that Xie Ziyan, as the head of the county and the secretary of the Party Committee of the Suixi County Huai River Project Headquarters, knowingly violated the decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, openly clamored to suppress criticism and suppress democracy, and carried out a series of persecutions against me. This is an extremely bad act of violating laws and disciplines. I request the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government of Anhui Province to investigate and handle this case.

Editor's note: Comrade Chen Chengdian, with the responsible attitude of the master of the country, actively criticized the design errors in the Huai River Project, which is of great significance for the continuous improvement of the Huai River Project and is worthy of great welcome. However, Xie Ziyan, the head of Suixi County, unreasonably carried out a series of persecutions against Comrade Chen Chengdian and openly clamored to "suppress criticism and suppress democracy," which is a criminal act that directly hinders the country's construction work. Therefore, we fully agree with Comrade Chen Chengdian's request. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government of Anhui Province should promptly investigate and resolutely handle this case.

    我要求安徽省领导机关检查濉溪县长谢子言在治淮工程中压制批评的罪恶行为
    陈成典
    我叫陈成典，安徽省宿县张山区贡山村人，中农成份，烈士家属，一九四八年参加革命工作。一九五二年我在濉溪县治淮总队“百善”大队任“财供股”股长时，因皖北日报刊载了我写的“濉溪县治淮工段工程师江涣设计错误并压制批评”一稿（见一九五二年二月二十八日该报，署名陈成），我竟遭到濉溪县县长谢子言等的百般迫害。那批评稿刊出后第二天，去年二月二十九日，谢子言就打电话找我，要我“检讨”写稿的动机。同时当地区长徐传义
    （贪污分子，三反时我检举过他）召集会议斗争我，问我“为什么写稿不通过组织”。我说我写的稿曾经给工程股长萧林看过。（编者按：即使没给看过也不为错。）我拒绝承认错误。三月四日，徐传义又接到谢子言的信，说要我到治淮总队部“谈写稿问题”。三月五日，我和萧林同志一起到治淮总队部。晚饭后谢子言要我和他去江涣工程师处“请罪”，我拒绝去。谢子言气呼呼地叫通信员把江工程师请来，同时还带来了四个人。在谢子言主持下，便开会斗争我，首先指定我谈写稿的动机和经过。我谈了工程设计错误的情况（如皖北日报刊载的）后，江工程师也承认了压制批评的事实。和江工程师一起来的几个人则批评我“无组织无纪律”，以后又追问我：“错误设计是一九五一年十二月就发现了，为什么一九五二年二月才投稿？”谢子言接着说我“应该检讨”，并粗暴地命令我“向江涣道歉”，“向报社公开检讨”。我说，应该到工地去检查工程设计的错误情况。谢子言便大发脾气，说我“看不起领导，自高自大，作风恶劣，无组织无纪律”；限我“三天内向报社写检讨，检讨书先交治淮总队审查”；并把我强留在治淮总队部。三月六日，谢子言又对我同样地说了一套，我仍然要求到工地去检查工程，征求该工段民工的意见。谢子言又大发脾气，说我“看不起领导，自高自大……”等等。并大声宣称：“我就压制批评，我就压制民主！你写稿向报社告我吧！”他大吵了一个多钟头。三月八日，谢子言又叫周炳恒同志让我写“检讨”，并给我看谢的信。信上说：“该陈成典作风恶劣，目无上级，自高自大，应该给该陈成典以严重警告，限他三日内写出检讨，经治淮总队审查后送往报社。”我受了这一连串的打击，心里非常难过，两天没吃东西。但我想起了毛主席教导我们要维护真理、坚持真理，想起了一九五○年中共中央发布的“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，我又鼓起了勇气。我以“坚持真理，继续斗争”为题向皖北日报揭发谢子言等压制批评和迫害我的行为。三月二十一日，我接到皖北日报“读者园地组”的一封信，信上除安慰我以外，说：“已去信给治淮委员会政治部，请他们处理。”这以后，一直没有回音。去年六月中，谢子言进一步迫害我，他利用职权，假借开会名义，召集十个区的区乡干部，县直属各机关、县人民监察委员会、县委纪律检查委员会的负责人等，共八百多人参加的扩大会议（叫作“重点检讨大会”）来斗争我。会议开始，谢子言指定我到主席台作“自我检讨”，后由大家发言。谢子言看发言的不多，他曾经先后三次动员说：“大家不要顾虑，大胆发言。如陈股长（指我）敢报复的话，我县长作保证，必给予严重的处分！”这斗争大会共开了一天一夜（点汽灯），主要内容就是说我“自高自大、看不起上级，写稿不通过上级、无组织无纪律，县长叫向报社写检讨而不写、不服从领导等等”。这些，县委纪律检查委员会和县人民监察委员会都有记录。斗争时，让我站在会场中间，不准我低头，不准我的身体依靠什么东西；吃饭时不准人和我说话，特别不准周股长、萧股长和我在一起（因为他俩和我意见一致）。这次斗争会以后，谢子言还不甘心。到去年七月间，谢子言又找我说：“上次的检讨对你教育不大，暂时调你到治淮总队部学习，暂不确定工作。”实际就是让我停职反省。我因为受打击过重，神经已经有些失常。我想，谢子言身为县长，又是濉溪县治淮总队党委会书记，对中共中央的决定竟明知故犯，竟公开叫嚣要压制批评、压制民主，对我进行一连串的迫害，这是极为恶劣的违法乱纪行为。我要求中共安徽省委会，安徽省人民政府检查处理。
    编者按：陈成典同志以国家主人翁的负责态度，积极地批评治淮工程中设计上的错误，这对治淮工作的不断改进是有重大意义，值得大大欢迎的。而濉溪县县长谢子言却横蛮无理地对陈成典同志进行了一连串的迫害，并公开叫嚣要“压制批评，压制民主”，这是直接妨害国家建设工作的犯罪行为。所以我们完全同意陈成典同志的要求。中共安徽省委和安徽省人民政府应该迅速检查并坚决处理此案。
