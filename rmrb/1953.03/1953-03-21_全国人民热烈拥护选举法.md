    The Whole Nation Warmly Supports the Election Law
    Editor's Note: After the promulgation of the "Election Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China," people from all ethnic groups and walks of life sent letters expressing their warm support and guaranteeing to actively participate in the great election movement. Now, we have selected some excerpts of these letters for publication here.
    The Implementation of the Election Law Will Greatly Consolidate and Strengthen the Unity of the People of the Whole Country
    Letter from Lei Jieqiong, Professor at Beijing College of Political Science and Law: The promulgation of the Election Law marks a new stage in the development of our country's people's democratic politics. We will use universal suffrage to produce a truly democratic National People's Congress to represent all the people and exercise democratic power. This election law is completely suitable for the current actual situation in our country. It stipulates the number of representatives to the people's congresses at all levels according to different population proportions, while taking into account the various situations of different regions, ethnic groups, and classes. This not only reflects the leading role of the working class in the country, but also enables all ethnic groups and classes in society to have representatives in the people's congresses at all levels commensurate with their status. The implementation of this election law will further enhance the unity of the people of all classes and ethnic groups across the country, further consolidate and develop the people's democratic united front, and further strengthen the ties between the people's government and the people; therefore, it will definitely greatly unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and strive for greater victories in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, for the industrialization of our country, and for building a socialist country!
    We Have a Truly Democratic Election Law
    Letter from all comrades of the State and Legal History Teaching and Research Section of the Law Department of the Renmin University of China: The promulgation of the Election Law is a major event in the political life of our people. It marks the great achievements of our country over the past three years and marks the further democratization of our country's politics. For the sake of democracy, how many revolutionary martyrs have shed their blood over the past century; the Chinese people have fought heroically for more than 30 years under the leadership of the Communist Party, and only now is democratic universal suffrage being realized for the first time on a national scale.
    Our election law cannot be compared with the election law of any bourgeois country. The election laws of bourgeois countries flaunt "democracy," but in essence, they are a deception. Many bourgeois countries have very high age restrictions. Britain stipulates that only owners of real estate with an annual income of five pounds can participate in elections. Engels once exposed its essence, saying: "In fact, who rules Britain—property." And the British House of Lords still retains the hereditary system. As for elections in the United States, they use money to suppress people. The recent US presidential election is a concentrated expression and concrete illustration of the ugly and essential nature of bourgeois elections. In short, the monopolistic capitalists and their agents rape the will of the people, and that is the truth about elections in bourgeois countries. The so-called "elections" of the Northern Warlords and the Kuomintang were even more notorious. Yuan Shikai used guns to force people to elect him as emperor, Cao Kun created the "Bribery Constitution" and the "Piglet National Assembly," and the election farce of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek is even more well known.
    Only in the new China where the people are the masters of their own affairs can we have a truly democratic election system. The people of the whole country will certainly cherish and support the Election Law and actively participate in the great universal suffrage movement.
    The Election Law Fully Guarantees the Democratic Rights of Women
    Letter from Liu Qingyang of the All-China Women's Federation: The Election Law fully demonstrates the spirit of equality between men and women, giving us women great encouragement. Article 4 of the Election Law not only clearly stipulates that all citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached the age of 18, regardless of gender, have the right to vote and to stand for election, but also specifically points out that "women have equal rights to vote and to stand for election as men." This fully guarantees the political rights of women who have suffered feudal oppression for thousands of years. We women cannot but sincerely thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. In addition to wholeheartedly supporting this election law that conforms to the interests of the people of the whole country, we must also earnestly study the Election Law and thoroughly publicize it to the broad masses of women so that everyone knows about it. Women all over the country should mobilize, prepare to welcome the universal suffrage, and be good new people and new women who are masters of their own affairs!
    The Election Law Educates Young People to Strengthen Their Loyalty and Love for the Motherland
    Letter from reader Hong Xiqi: The Election Law has been promulgated. I am reporting some of my thoughts to you: I remember that in the era of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, the Kuomintang's bureaucratic politicians also used to sing praises such as "Youth are the flowers of the nation"; but in fact, the executioners who massacred Chinese youth were precisely these guys. Just before and after the stinking pseudo-"National Assembly" was convened in 1946, how many young people did the Kuomintang reactionaries massacre! After liberation, the Communist Party loves young people. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, our youth have become smarter, braver, and more capable. On all fronts of the motherland, many heroic figures like Hao Jianxiu and Huang Jiguang have continuously emerged. Now, Chairman Mao has promulgated the Election Law, stipulating that all citizens who have reached the age of 18 have the right to vote and to be elected as representatives to people's congresses at all levels. This means that the connection between our youth and the people's government will be closer; some outstanding young people who are full of revolutionary vigor, dare to criticize and self-criticize, and dare to expose bad people and bad deeds will be elected to the people's congresses at all levels, elected to the political power, and manage the major affairs of the country. This more profoundly educates our youth on how to be masters of the country, how to cultivate their loyalty and love for the motherland, and their sense of responsibility for the cause of the people. I will work a hundred times more enthusiastically for the motherland and the people.
    The Election Law Makes the People of Minority Nationalities More Deeply Aware of the Significance of Being Masters of Their Own Affairs
    Letter from the Student Union Correspondence Group of the Central Institute for Nationalities: After seeing the Election Law, the students of our institute felt jubilant and encouraged. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries implemented a policy of Han chauvinism towards the people of minority nationalities; the people of minority nationalities lived a life worse than that of beasts of burden for generations, and there was no talk of any democratic rights. After liberation, the people of minority nationalities turned themselves over, and this Election Law promulgated by Chairman Mao has given special consideration to the people of minority nationalities; the students are deeply moved. Tibetan student Zhang Guosheng said after reading the Election Law: "Under the care and leadership of Chairman Mao, the Election Law specifically stipulates the democratic rights of the people of minority nationalities, which makes us more deeply aware of the significance of being masters of our own affairs!" Qiang student Wang Xikun recalled the situation in the past when the Kuomintang reactionary rulers appointed a Qiang scoundrel as a puppet National Assembly representative, extorting money from the Qiang people every day, and felt even more that only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can the people of minority nationalities truly be masters of their own affairs. In addition to wholeheartedly supporting the Election Law, students of the institute of 47 nationalities including Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Miao, Yao, Li, Gaoshan, and Uyghur have expressed their willingness to do a good job in the publicity work for the universal suffrage and work hard to study, so as to greet this great national universal suffrage with practical actions.
    Actively Dedicate Strength to the Construction of the Motherland to Answer the Motherland's Concern for Overseas Chinese
    Letter from reader Wu Yixiu: I am a returned overseas Chinese. How concerned we overseas Chinese are about our motherland! In the past, we overseas Chinese were subjected to oppression and discrimination, and the Kuomintang reactionaries simply did not care. At that time, we hoped day and night that the motherland would become strong. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people stood up, and the great People's Republic of China was born. The people's government takes care of us overseas Chinese in every possible way. Article 58 of the Common Program clearly stipulates: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China shall do its best to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese." Article 23 of Chapter 3 of the recently promulgated Election Law also stipulates that "30 representatives to the National People's Congress shall be elected from overseas Chinese." This guarantees that we overseas Chinese enjoy the democratic rights that we deserve. How concerned the motherland is about us overseas Chinese. We overseas Chinese wholeheartedly support the Election Law and are willing to actively dedicate our strength to the construction work of the motherland.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    全国人民热烈拥护选举法
    编者按：“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会选举法”公布后，各族各界人士纷纷来信表示热烈拥护，并保证要积极参加伟大的选举运动。现在，我们选择一部分来信摘要发表在这里。
    选举法的执行将大大巩固和加强全国人民的团结
    北京政法学院教授雷洁琼来信：选举法的颁布标志着我国人民民主政治发展的新阶段。我们将用普选方法产生真正民主的全国人民代表大会，代表全体人民行使民主权力。这个选举法是完全适合我国当前实际情况的。它按照不同人口比例，同时照顾不同地区、民族、阶级等各种情况，规定各级人民代表大会代表的名额，这样不独反映着工人阶级对于国家的领导作用，同时使社会各民族、各阶级都在各级人民代表大会中有与其地位相称的代表。这个选举法的执行将使全国各阶级、各民族人民的团结更加增强，人民民主统一战线获得进一步的巩固和发展，人民政府与人民的联系更加密切；因而一定大大发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，为争取抗美援朝更大胜利、为我们国家工业化、为建设社会主义国家而努力奋斗！
    我们有了真正民主的选举法
    中国人民大学法律系国家与法权历史教研室全体同志来信：选举法的颁布，是我国人民政治生活中的一件大事。它标志着我国三年来的伟大成就，标志着我国政治进一步民主化。为了民主，百余年来多少革命烈士洒出了鲜血；中国人民在共产党领导下英勇斗争了三十多年，民主普选才第一次在全国范围内实现。
    我们的选举法是任何资产阶级国家的选举法所不能比拟的。资产阶级国家的选举法标榜着“民主”，但实质上是个骗局。很多资产阶级国家有很高的年龄限制。英国更规定须每年有五英镑收入的不动产所有者才能参加选举，恩格斯曾揭穿其本质说：“事实上，统治英国的是谁——财产。”而英国上议院代表至今还保留着世袭制度。至于美国的选举，就是用金钱压人。最近美国总统选举就是资产阶级选举丑态和本质的集中表现与具体说明。总之，垄断资本家及其代理人强奸人民的意志，这就是资产阶级国家选举的真相。北洋军阀、国民党的所谓“选举”，更是臭名远扬。袁世凯用枪杆叫人家选他当皇帝，曹锟弄出了“贿选宪法”“猪仔国大”，国贼蒋介石的选举丑剧更是人所尽知。
    只有在人民当家作主的新中国，我们才有了真正民主的选举制度。全国人民一定会珍惜、拥护选举法，积极参加伟大的普选运动。
    选举法充分保障了妇女的民主权利
    中华全国民主妇女联合会刘清扬来信：选举法充分表现了男女平等的精神，给我们妇女以极大的鼓励。选举法第四条中除明白规定凡年满十八周岁之中华人民共和国公民不分性别均有选举权和被选举权外，又特别指出“妇女有与男子同等的选举权和被选举权”。这就充分保障了过去数千年来遭受封建压迫的妇女的政治权利。我们妇女不能不衷心感谢毛主席和共产党。我们除了竭诚拥护这个符合全国人民利益的选举法外，并且要认真学习选举法，深入向广大妇女群众进行宣传，作到家喻户晓。全国妇女们动员起来，准备迎接普选，作好当家作主的新人民和新妇女！
    选举法教育青年加强对祖国的忠诚和热爱
    读者洪锡祺来信：选举法公布了。我向你们报告我的一些感想：记得在蒋介石反动统治时代，国民党的官僚政客们也曾经高唱“青年是国家之花”一类的话；但是事实上屠杀中国青年的刽子手也正是他们这班家伙。就在一九四六年臭气薰天的伪“国大”召开前后，国民党反动派曾经屠杀了多少青年呵！解放后，共产党热爱青年。我们青年在党的培养和教育下，变得更加聪明、更加勇敢、更加能干了。在祖国的各个战线上，连续不断地出现了很多像郝建秀、黄继光这样的英雄人物。如今，毛主席公布了选举法，规定凡年满十八周岁的公民，就有选举权和被选为各级人民代表大会代表的权利。这就是说，我们青年与人民政府的联系就会更加密切；一些富有革命朝气、勇于批评与自我批评、勇于揭发坏人坏事的青年优秀分子将选到各级人民代表大会中去，选到政权中去，管理国家的大事。这更加深刻地教育我们青年如何做国家的主人，如何培养自己对祖国的忠诚和热爱，对人民事业的责任感。我将热情百倍地为祖国为人民做更多的事情。
    选举法使少数民族人民更加深刻地认识当家作主的意义
    中央民族学院学生会通讯组来信：我院同学看到了选举法后，都感到欢欣鼓舞。过去国民党反动派对少数民族人民实行大汉族主义的统治；少数民族人民世世代代过着牛马不如的生活，根本谈不到什么民主权利。解放后少数民族人民翻身了，这次毛主席公布的选举法更对少数民族人民有特别的照顾；同学们深深受到感动。藏族同学张国生看了选举法后说：“在毛主席的关怀和领导下，选举法中特别规定了少数民族人民的民主权利，这使我们更加深刻地体会到当家作主的意义！”羌族同学汪锡坤回忆过去国民党反动统治者指定一个羌族的坏蛋当伪国大代表，天天刮羌族人民的钱的情况后，更加感到只有在毛主席和共产党的领导下，少数民族人民才能真正当家作主人。我院蒙、回、藏、苗、瑶、黎、高山、维吾尔等四十七种民族同学除了衷心拥护选举法外，并纷纷表示要作好普选宣传工作，努力学习，以实际行动来迎接这次伟大的全国人民的普选。
    积极为祖国建设献出力量来回答祖国对华侨的关切
    读者吴益修来信：我是一个归国华侨。我们华侨在国外是多么关切祖国啊！过去我们海外华侨受到压迫和歧视，国民党反动派根本不管。那时候我们昼夜希望祖国强大起来。在共产党、毛主席英明的领导下，中国人民站起来了，伟大的中华人民共和国诞生了。人民政府无微不至地照顾我们华侨。共同纲领第五十八条就明确规定：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府应尽力保护国外华侨的正当权益。”最近公布的选举法第三章第二十三条又规定“国外华侨应选全国人民代表大会代表三十人”。这就保障了我们华侨享受到应有的民主权利。祖国对我们华侨多么关切。我们华侨竭诚拥护选举法，并愿为祖国的建设工作积极献出力量。
