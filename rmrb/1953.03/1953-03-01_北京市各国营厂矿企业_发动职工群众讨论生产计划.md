State-owned Factories and Mines in Beijing
    Mobilize Workers to Discuss Production Plans

[This newspaper] Currently, state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines in Beijing are actively mobilizing workers to thoroughly discuss the implementation of the 1953 national production plan in conjunction with the promotion of the Five-Three Factory experience. The following preliminary experiences have been gained by various units in this work.

First, unify the thinking of cadres and train key personnel. Before mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory first organized leading cadres from the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League at the factory level under the unified leadership of the Party committee to study and unify their thinking and work pace. At the same time, key personnel were trained on a large scale to make them clearly understand the importance, purpose, and requirements of discussing the national plan and the factory's production tasks for this year, so they could actively play a leading role among the masses. Before mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan, the leadership of the Liulihe Cement Plant first organized 44 cadres from the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League above the workshop level in the entire plant to study specifically for three days, combining the promotion of the Five-Three Factory experience and examining the shortcomings of the plant's past work. They grasped key issues, organized forces, and went to the workshops separately, initially playing an organizational role. The Shijingshan Power Plant opened three training classes to explain to the cadres the important significance of formulating this year's plan, the experience of the Five-Three Factory, and the leadership methods for mobilizing the masses to formulate the plan, cultivating a large number of key personnel. In the study, many cadres examined and criticized conservative thinking, greatly enhancing their confidence in completing the plan.

Second, strengthen publicity and education, and conduct in-depth ideological mobilization. The leadership of the Liulihe Cement Plant, in response to the past thinking of some cadres and the masses who did not pay attention to the plan, explained the great significance of the large-scale national economic construction at a general meeting of all employees, pointing out the close relationship between the plant's cement production and the national Five-Year Construction Plan and strengthening the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. It called on employees to fully exert their enthusiasm and creativity to ensure the completion of production tasks, and established in the minds of employees the concept that the national plan is an active law. At the same time, Party and Youth League member meetings, advanced producer and activist symposiums, union group leader joint meetings, and workshop meetings were also held in various workshops, where the leadership reported on the plant's cost plan expenditures and raw material consumption, reversing the past tendency of some cadres and the masses to only focus on output and ignore the cost plan. In order to make the publicity penetrate deeply into the hearts of the people, the leadership of the Shijingshan Power Plant focused on the boiler workshop, summarized the advanced ideas of advanced figures, and used living people and real events to inspire employees to conduct mass self-education, so that the work of discussing the plan could proceed smoothly under the guidance of advanced thinking.

Third, grasp the key to production, clarify the focus of discussion, promote advanced experience, and actively study improvements. When discussing the various indicators of the national plan in the Five-Three Workshop of the Beijing People's Printing Factory, the leadership pointed out that the key to production was the two major problems of paper skew and product dirtiness, and immediately adjusted the unreasonable labor organization, added and replaced necessary equipment, and mobilized employees to use their brains and think of ways to solve the two major key problems in production. Before mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan, the leadership of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory analyzed the factory's production situation and found that the excessive scrap rate in the foundry workshop was the key problem in the current production. It also found the key problems that should be solved in other workshops and conducted preliminary analysis and research. It is now actively preparing to mobilize the masses to find tricks and make rationalization proposals. When discussing the plan, the Liulihe Cement Plant, due to the leadership's pointing out the key problems in the calcination workshop, inspired the enthusiasm of the masses, and all employees in the plant put forward a total of 487 rationalization proposals.

Fourth, formulate advanced group plans and stipulate specific guarantee measures. The Zhang Huizhen group and the two workers, Li Zhongyuan and Li Xueqin, of the Beijing Garment Factory, with the help of leading comrades, formulated advanced group plans and individual plans according to the production tasks of their group and individuals. The plans not only included output and quality figures, but also stipulated the study of advanced experience, guaranteed attendance rates, a special person responsible for the inspection system, etc., and made specific guarantee measures. When mobilizing employees to order plans in the Five-Three Workshop of the Beijing People's Printing Factory, the experience of the Wu Jifu group in ordering the group's patriotic pact was introduced. Each group formulated a patriotic pact, and the content generally included: output and quality indicators, specific technical measures, ensuring the study of advanced experience, and technical mutual assistance. The pact is simple and clear, with goals and methods, and truly becomes a conscious action program for the masses.

Fifth, mobilize technicians and staff to participate in the formulation of a comprehensive plan. In the past, some factories and mines only had output and quality plans, lacking plans to reduce costs; some factories and mines had formulated them, but did not pay enough attention to them. The formulation of labor plans, financial plans, and cost plans was even worse. This situation has begun to change in this discussion plan. According to the national production tasks, the Shijingshan Power Plant focused on the boiler workshop and mobilized technicians and staff to participate in the formulation of a major repair plan, a wage plan, a labor plan, a cost plan, and an organizational measures plan, and all the comprehensive indicators were well formulated. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory organized four working groups by the administration and the labor union to formulate technical measures plans, financial plans, production plans, and worker welfare plans respectively. Through these methods, the factory's production and management departments are linked together.

Sixth, cultivate typical examples and promote all-round development. The working method of focusing on pilot projects and promoting all-round development has been used by the leadership of many factories and mines. The leadership of the Shijingshan Power Plant organized cadres to discuss the plan while organizing forces to go deep into the boiler workshop to cultivate typical groups, absorb the experience of mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate advanced plans, and prepare for all-round promotion. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory cultivated two typical groups, designated special personnel to be responsible for specifically helping to formulate group guarantee plans. The leading comrades of the Beijing People's Printing Factory helped the typical group summarize the experience of ordering plans, and made a typical report at the staff meeting, setting up a living example for the staff to formulate advanced plans and promote the work.

However, at present, some units have not done enough ideological mobilization in the process of mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate plans. They have failed to conduct in-depth publicity and education on the "three major tasks" of the people of the whole country proposed in the New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily this year and the "three points of instruction" of Chairman Mao at the Fourth Meeting of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, so as to inspire the political consciousness of the masses, promote employees to actively find tricks, and order advanced plans. At the same time, some units have still failed to seriously promote the Five-Three Factory experience in conjunction with the discussion of the plan, and use working methods such as grasping key issues and typical demonstrations to effectively mobilize the masses and do a good job in discussing the plan. These all need to be improved rapidly.

    北京市各国营厂矿企业
    发动职工群众讨论生产计划
    【本报讯】目前北京市各国营及地方国营厂矿企业正结合推广五三工厂经验，积极发动职工群众深入讨论执行一九五三年国家生产计划。各单位在这一工作中，已获得了如下几项初步经验。
    第一、统一干部思想，训练工作骨干。华北农业机械总厂在发动群众讨论计划前，首先在党委统一领导下，组织厂一级的党、政、工、团的领导干部进行了学习，以统一思想与工作步调。同时大规模地训练工作骨干，使他们明确认识讨论国家计划的重要意义、目的与要求和本厂今年的生产任务，在群众中积极发挥骨干带头作用。琉璃河水泥厂在发动群众讨论计划前，领导上首先组织了全厂党、政、工、团的车间以上干部四十四人，专门学习了三天，结合推广五三工厂经验，检查了本厂过去工作的缺点，抓住关键问题，组织力量，分头深入车间，初步发挥了组织作用。石景山发电厂开办了三个训练班，对干部讲明了今年制订计划的重要意义及五三工厂的经验，和发动群众制订计划的领导方法，培养了大批工作骨干。学习中不少干部检查与批判了保守思想，大大地提高了完成计划的信心。
    第二、加强宣传教育，深入思想动员。琉璃河水泥厂领导上针对过去某些干部与群众不重视计划的思想，在全厂职工大会上，说明国家大规模经济建设的伟大意义，指出本厂水泥生产对国家五年建设计划与加强抗美援朝斗争的密切关系，号召职工充分发挥积极性和创造性来保证完成生产任务，并在职工中树立起国家计划就是积极的法律的观念。同时，各车间也召开了党员和团员大会、先进生产者和积极分子座谈会、工会小组长联席会、车间大会，由领导上报告了本厂成本计划开支、原材料消耗的情况，扭转了某些干部与群众过去只重视产量而忽视成本计划的偏向。石景山发电厂领导上为了使宣传深入人心，以锅炉车间为重点，总结了先进人物的先进思想，用活人活事来启发职工进行群众性的自我教育，使讨论计划的工作在先进思想指导下顺利进行。
    第三、抓住生产关键，明确讨论重点，推广先进经验，积极研究改进。北京人民印刷厂五三车间在讨论国家计划的各项指标时，领导上指出了生产上的关键是续纸歪与产品脏两大问题，当即调整了不合理的劳动组织，增添和改换了必要的设备，同时发动职工开动脑筋、想办法，解决了生产上两大关键问题。华北农业机械总厂在发动群众讨论计划前，领导上分析了全厂生产情况，找出了铸工车间报废率过高是当前生产中的关键问题，同时也找出了其它各车间当前应解决的关键问题，进行了初步分析研究，现正积极准备发动群众找窍门，提合理化建议。琉璃河水泥厂讨论计划时，由于领导上指出烧成车间的关键问题，启发了群众的积极性，全厂职工共提出了四百八十七件合理化建议。
    第四、制订先进小组计划，规定具体保证办法。北京被服厂张惠珍小组及李忠元、李学琴两个工人，在领导同志帮助下，根据本组及个人生产任务，制订了先进的小组计划与个人计划，计划中不仅包括产量、质量数字指标，而且规定了学习先进经验、保证出勤率、专人负责检查制度等，并作出具体保证办法。北京人民印刷厂五三车间发动职工订计划时，介绍了吴吉福小组订小组爱国公约的经验，各小组都制订了爱国公约，内容一般都包括：产量、质量指标，具体的技术措施，保证学习先进经验和技术互助等。公约简单明确，有目标，有办法，真正成为群众自觉的行动纲领。
    第五、发动技术人员、职员参加制订全面计划。过去有些厂矿企业只有产量、质量计划，缺少减低成本的计划；有些厂矿虽制订了，但重视不够，对于制订劳动计划、财务计划、成本计划等则更差。此次讨论计划中已开始扭转这种情况。石景山发电厂根据国家生产任务，以锅炉车间为重点，发动技术人员与职员参加制订了大修计划、工资计划、劳动计划、成本计划、组织措施计划等，把全面的各项指标计划都制订好了。华北农业机械总厂由行政上与工会组织了四个工作组，分别制订技术措施计划、财务计划、生产计划、工人福利计划等。通过这些办法，将工厂生产部门与管理部门联成一气。
    第六、培养典型、推动全面。重点试验、带动全面的工作方法，已为许多厂矿领导上所运用。石景山发电厂领导上一面组织干部讨论计划，同时组织力量，深入锅炉车间培养典型小组，吸取发动群众讨论和制订先进计划的经验，准备全面推广。华北农业机械总厂培养了两个典型小组，指定专人负责，具体帮助制订小组保证计划。北京人民印刷厂领导同志帮助典型小组总结了订计划的经验，并在职工大会上作了典型报告，为职工群众制订先进的计划树立了活的榜样，推动了工作。
    但目前有些单位在发动群众讨论和制订计划过程中，思想动员工作仍做的不够充分，未能将人民日报今年元旦社论中提出的全国人民“三大任务”及毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上的“三点指示”进行深入的宣传教育，以启发群众的政治觉悟，推动职工积极找窍门，订出先进计划。同时有的单位仍未能结合讨论计划，认真推广五三工厂经验，运用抓住关键问题、典型示范等工作方法，有力地发动群众，做好讨论计划的工作。这些都需要迅速改进。
