    Excavating and Organizing the Folk Art Heritage of the Motherland
    ——A Record of the First Folk Art Performance of Liaodong Province
    Hu Sha
    Editor's Note: The gains of the First Folk Art Performance of Liaodong Province specifically illustrate that our country's folk music and dance art is extremely rich. The excavation of this folk art wealth is of great significance and effect for the development of mass cultural work. However, at present, some grassroots cadres in certain areas have incorrect views on the folk art heritage. Seeing that some folk arts contain certain superstitious and backward elements, they adopt a crude and negative attitude towards all folk arts; some believe that folk art cannot be combined with the central tasks of the local area at that time, thus preventing the masses from engaging in such amateur cultural and recreational activities; some even prohibit folk artists from performing and confiscate their musical instruments. This erroneous view and practice must be resolutely corrected. Cultural leading organs in various regions should earnestly excavate the folk art heritage, eliminate its feudal dross, promote its essence, and systematically collect, organize, and improve it, and then carry out demonstrative performances among the masses to enrich and improve the artistic life of the masses.

    In mid-January of this year, we observed the First Folk Art Performance of Liaodong Province in Andong City. The folk art forms participating in this performance were diverse and splendid, including folk music, dance, opera, storytelling, puppet shows, shadow plays, "Diyangge" (field秧歌), stilt walking, lion dances, and more. Some were performed on stage, and some were performed in the square. Among them were some folk music, dance, and opera forms that had been lost for two or three decades or were rarely seen.
    The performance demonstrated an important fact: in a corner of our motherland's Northeast frontier, after preliminary excavation, such rich and brilliant folk art forms were discovered. If all parts of the country pay attention to and excavate folk art, even more beautiful art forms will surely be discovered.
    The "Diyangge" performed by Liaoyang County had been lost for more than thirty years. This time, it was restored by the joint efforts of seventy-seven-year-old artist Meng Guanglun and three other veteran artists. This is a folk collective dance. It basically consists of two dance teams, with one person conducting, and the two teams changing dances with each other. This time, only three formations were performed: "Layering Clouds," "Fish and Dragon Transformation," and "Bagua Doudi Formation" (Eight Trigram Battle Formation). The characteristics are graceful dance postures and complex formation changes, which were obviously carefully designed. Xie Yuelai, a fifty-two-year-old artist from Xinjin County, performed the "Fengyang Flower Drum." His superb skills were reflected in the swirling dance of the tassels on his foot-long drumsticks, which can also be said to be his personal creation. He started playing the flower drum at the age of thirteen. Through long-term study, he developed the drumstick tassel performance art into a unique dance form. I watched him perform for nearly half an hour. The drumsticks were struck in various patterns, the body movements were complex, and he could control the swirling of his drum tassels, or use the drum tassels to strike the drum back and forth. The posture was very calm, and the technique was accurate and skillful. Li Wenqing, a fifty-three-year-old artist from Yingkou City, performed the "Butterfly Catching Dance," which is also an excellent dance sketch. This dance involves only two people, one playing a boy and the other playing a butterfly. This fifty-three-year-old artist vividly portrayed the boy's innocent and joyful mood, full of emotion, giving people a feeling of optimism and happiness. The above are some of the wonderful programs I saw.
    In this performance, folk song and dance operas from the countryside were also performed. "Errenzhuan" (two-person show, commonly known as "Bengbeng," artists dislike the inelegant word "Bengbeng" and call it "Errenzhuan," "Errenxi," or "Duikouxi") involves a man and a woman, and can perform large sets of folk stories. This art form is loved by the broad masses. "Errenzhuan" has more than a hundred repertoires, and its music is particularly clear, healthy, and joyful, with many tunes. Artists often boast of "nine tunes and eighteen styles, seventy-two coughs." In this performance, Luan Jicheng and Zhang Jiaqing from Liaoyuan City performed "The Story of the West Chamber," and their singing expressions were very delicate and moving, especially their grasp of rhythm. In places of intense emotion, they cooperated with the clapper of the lotus flower to render the atmosphere, and sudden pauses achieved a strong dramatic effect. Guo Zhongren, a young artist from Liuhe County, performed "Smashing the Mirror Frame," which profoundly depicted the mood of a young woman longing for her lover. Cheng Guangtian's "Double Suppressing the Mountain" from Liaoyang County has a strong farmer style in both singing and dancing.
    Artists from Hailong County performed "Wang Po Scolding the Chicken" and "Beating Dates," which is a rare opera form called "Laba Opera" (喇叭戏). The tune of this Laba Opera is humorous, and the performance is very suitable for comedies.
    Several puppet shows participated in this performance, including large-headed puppets (puppets are more than a foot long, and one person performs one character) and small-headed puppets (one person performs multiple characters), which were all welcomed at this conference. For example, the large-headed puppet "Journey to the West" from Andong County described Zhu Bajie's (Pigsy's) marriage proposal, and meticulously portrayed the personalities of Sun Wukong (Monkey King), Zhu Bajie, and the rich man's silly son. It is especially valuable that the puppets' movements have a physical feel. This is the outstanding creation of those veteran artists who have dedicated their lives to puppet art.
    The shadow play was performed by the troupe led by Geng Qingfeng from Xiuyan County with "The Soviet Army Liberates the Northeast" and the "Little Son-in-Law" performed by artists from Fengcheng County. The shadow play also has a strong ability to express life, and there are few performance restrictions. There were also many excellent instrumental ensembles, such as "Crying to Heaven" from Liaoyang County, which can express emotions very well. The artist who played the trumpet was the most outstanding player in three generations.
    The purpose of this folk art performance in Liaodong Province was to explore local folk art forms, encourage their development, and enable them to better serve the people. There were seventy-three veteran artists over the age of fifty participating in the conference. Some of these old gentlemen had not worked for many years due to old age, and some had changed careers to farming, but they are lovers and preservers of folk art. We should learn from them. This time, the cultural and educational cadres of Liaoyang County, Liaodong Province, united a group of veteran artists. With their help, they restored the "Diyangge" and sang some beautiful folk songs and tunes from fifty years ago. Hailong County discovered a family that could sing Zhuguxi (轴轱戏). It is said that this family has lived in this village for more than 20 years, and the neighbors did not know that they could sing Zhuguxi. This time, they were also discovered and performed "Three Persuasions." This spirit of in-depth excavation of folk art is worthy of learning and encouragement.
    These elderly artists also felt extremely honored and excited to participate in this performance. In order to participate in the performance, some shaved their beards and had their missing teeth filled; some were almost eighty years old, but they were still as lively as dragons and tigers on the stage; some participated in the performance while sick. They were moved to tears by the people's government's respect for them, because they had suffered discrimination and hardship in the past.
    From this performance, it can be seen that there are beautiful and rich treasures in our folk music, dance, and opera programs. For example, flower drums, lion dances, and puppet shows all express the bravery, wit, liveliness, and health of the working people. Some folk art forms, after processing, become very beautiful art. For example, there is a Taiping drum (peace drum) program that has been processed and adapted into a collective dance, removing the original content of offering sacrifices to gods and ghosts, and turning it into a collective dance celebrating the harvest, expressing the joy of the peasants. Another example is the "Butterfly Catching Dance," which was originally "Silly Young Master Catching Butterflies," but now the clown is changed to a handsome appearance, depicting a young boy's happy mood, and the result is very popular. Another example is "Errenzhuan," which was originally one female and one ugly male, but in this performance, some changed the ugly male to a handsome appearance. Comparing the two, the handsome appearance is naturally better. The folk art performance in Liaodong Province was a success. On the one hand, it discovered many lost and beautiful folk arts, and on the other hand, it prepared favorable conditions for mass cultural and recreational activities. The performance also shows that uniting veteran artists, organizing folk art heritage, taking its essence, removing its dross, and taking a step forward on the original basis is an important beginning for the reform and development of folk art.

    挖掘和整理祖国民间艺术遗产
    ——记辽东省第一届民间艺术会演
    胡沙
    编者按：辽东省第一届民间艺术会演的收获，具体说明了我国民间音乐舞蹈艺术是非常丰富的。这种民间艺术财富的发掘，对群众文艺工作的开展有很大的意义和作用。但目前某些地区基层干部对民间艺术遗产却有不正确的看法。他们看到某些民间艺术中有某些迷信落后成分，就对一切民间艺术采取粗暴的否定态度；有的认为民间艺术不能结合当地当时的中心任务，因而阻止群众从事这种业余的文化娱乐活动；有的甚至禁止民间艺人演出，没收他们的乐器。这种错误的看法和做法，必须切实加以纠正。各地文化领导机关应该认真地挖掘民间艺术遗产，剔除其封建糟粕，发扬其精华，有计划地加以收集、整理和提高，再在群众中进行示范性的演出，以丰富和提高群众的艺术生活。
    本年一月中旬，我们在安东市观摩了辽东省第一届民间艺术会演。参加这次会演的民间艺术形式是多样而精彩的，有民间音乐、舞蹈、戏曲、说唱、木偶戏、皮影戏、地秧歌、高跷、斗狮子等。有的在舞台上表演，有的在广场上表演。其中有一些是失传了二、三十年的或平常不多见的民间音乐、舞蹈、戏曲形式。
    会演说明了一件重要的事实：在我们祖国东北边缘的一角，经过初步发掘，就发现了如此丰富灿烂的民间艺术形式。如果全国各地都对民间艺术加以重视和发掘，一定会发现更多优美的艺术形式。
    辽阳县表演的“地秧歌”，已失传三十多年了，这次由七十七岁的老艺人孟广伦和另外三个老艺人共同努力，把它恢复起来。这是一种民间的集体舞。基本上由两个舞队组成，一个人指挥，两队相互变化舞蹈。这次只表演“叠云层”“鱼龙变化”
    “八卦斗底阵”，三个阵式，特点是舞姿优美，队形变化复杂，显然是经过精心设计的。新金县五十二岁老艺人谢悦来表演了“凤阳花鼓”。他的高超的技艺表现在他的一尺多长的鼓捶穗子的旋舞上，这也可说是他个人的独创。他从十三岁起就开始打花鼓，经过长期的钻研，他把鼓捶穗子的表演艺术发展成为一种独特的舞蹈形式。我看他一次表演了近半个钟头，鼓捶敲打各种花样，身体动作变化复杂，又能控制他的鼓穗旋舞，或用鼓穗前后击鼓，姿态非常沉着，技术准确灵巧。营口市五十三岁的老艺人李文清演的“扑蝶舞”，也是一个优秀的舞蹈小品。这个舞蹈只有两人，一个演少年，一个演蝴蝶。这个五十三岁的老艺人把一个少年天真喜悦的心情描绘得淋漓尽致，情绪饱满，给人一种乐观愉快的感受。以上是我所看到的一些精彩节目。
    在这次会演中，还演出了来自农村的民间歌舞小戏。“二人转”（俗称蹦蹦，艺人嫌“蹦蹦”二字不雅，自称“二人转”，“二人戏”或“对口戏”），一男一女，可以表演成本大套的民间故事，这种艺术形式是为广大群众所喜爱的。“二人转”有一百多个剧目，它的音乐特别明朗，健康，愉快，曲调繁多，艺人常以“九腔十八调，七十二咳咳”自夸。这次会演中辽源市栾继成、张家庆的“西厢记”演唱表情都很细致动人，尤其节奏把握得好，在情感炽烈的地方，配合着莲花落的竹板渲染气氛，和突然的顿歇，取得强烈的戏剧效果。柳河县青年艺人郭中仁表演的“摔镜架”把一个少妇思念情人的心情描绘得非常深刻。辽阳县程广田的
    “双镇山”，歌唱和舞蹈都具有浓厚的农民风格。
    海龙县艺人表演了一出“王婆骂鸡”，一出“打枣”，这是一种不多见的戏曲形式，叫做“喇叭戏”。这种喇叭戏曲调诙谐，表演喜剧很为适当。
    这次有好几班木偶戏参加会演，有大头木偶（木偶有一尺多长，一个人表演一个人物），有小头木偶
    （一人表演多个人物），都在这次大会上受到欢迎。如安东县大头木偶“西游记”描写猪八戒招亲，将孙悟空，猪八戒，员外的傻小子几个人物的性格描绘得很细致，尤其可贵的是木偶动作起来很有肉体的感觉。这是那些终生献身于木偶艺术的老艺人的杰出创造。
    皮影戏有岫岩县耿庆丰领导的班子表演的“苏军解放东北记”和凤城县艺人表演的“小女婿”。皮影戏表现生活的能力也很强，表演限制很少。器乐合奏也有许多优秀的演奏，如：辽阳县的“哭皇天”，很能表达情感，那位吹喇叭的艺人三代都是最优秀的吹手。
    辽东省这次民间艺术会演，是以发掘各地方的民间艺术形式，鼓励其发展，使其更好地为人民服务为目的的。参加大会的五十岁以上的老艺人有七十三位。这些老先生有的因年老多年不干了，有的改行务农了，但是他们是民间艺术的热爱者和保存者。应该向他们学习。辽东省辽阳县文教干部这次团结了一批老艺人，在他们的帮助下恢复了“地秧歌”，歌唱了五十年前的一些优美的民歌小调。海龙县发现了一家会唱轴轱戏的，据说这家人在这村住了二十多年，邻家都不知他们会唱轴轱戏。这次他们也被发掘出来，表演了“三劝”。这种深入地挖掘民间艺术的精神是值得学习和鼓励的。
    这些老年艺人，对于参加这次会演也感到极大的光荣和兴奋。他们为了参加会演，有的把胡须也剃去了，牙齿脱落的镶了牙；有的已经是快八十岁的老人了，在舞台上还是生龙活虎一般；有的带病参加表演。对于人民政府这样尊重他们，有的感动得落泪，因为他们以前受尽了歧视和艰辛。
    从这次会演中可以看出，在我们的民间音乐舞蹈戏曲节目中，有着优美的丰富的宝藏。如花鼓、舞狮、木偶戏等，都表现了劳动人民的勇敢、机智、活泼、健康。有些民间艺术形式，经过加工，成为很优美的艺术。例如有一个太平鼓的节目，是经过加工改编成为集体舞蹈，去掉原有的祭神打鬼的内容，变成庆贺丰收的集体舞，表现了农民的欢乐情绪。又如“扑蝶舞”，原来是“傻公子扑蝶”，现在把丑角改成俊扮，描写一个少年的快乐情绪，结果很受欢迎。再如“二人转”原来是一旦一丑，这次会演中就有的把丑改成俊扮，两相比较，自然俊扮较好。辽东省的民间艺术会演是成功的。它一面发掘了许多失传的优美的民间艺术，一方面为群众文娱活动准备了有利条件。会演也说明：团结老艺人，整理民间艺术遗产，取其精华，去其糟粕，在原有的基础上提高一步，这是改革和发展民间艺术的重要的开端。
