    Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 23rd (TASS dispatch): The economic situation in the United States has aroused deep concern among American bourgeois economists and observers. They believe that, despite the government's maintenance of a high level of war preparations expenditure, the "weaknesses" developing in the US economy are serious enough to make a significant decline in the US economy possible.

    These commentators believe that among these "weaknesses," some have already formed, some are in the process of forming, and some may erupt into major destructive forces in the not-too-distant future. In the first category are: 1. A sharp decline in agricultural product prices and farmers' income; 2. A decrease in exports that began in the second half of last year. In the second category are: 1. The prospect of reduced capital investment; 2. The danger of increased inventory and overproduction in steel, automobiles, and other industries; 3. The danger of a sharp increase in consumer debt and the resulting shrinking of the domestic consumer market. Due to a 12% drop in agricultural product prices in the past year, farmers' net income in 1952 was approximately 15% lower than in 1947. Officials at the Department of Agriculture predict that farmers' net income will fall by more than 5% further.

    Many commentators, when discussing the agricultural situation, recall that the economic Great Depression of the early 1930s began with an agricultural crisis.

    The decrease in agricultural product exports is one reason for the decrease in American exports, but it is not the whole reason. Exports of oil, coal, and other products decreased along with grains and cotton. According to the "Wall Street Journal," if military exports are excluded, American exports in 1952 decreased by approximately $800 million compared to 1951. According to John Quirk, Vice President of the National Foreign Trade Council, experts estimate that there will be a further reduction of approximately $700 million this year. In Quirk's view, American exports this year will encounter "greater competition from the resurgence of German and Japanese export trade."

    While exports are decreasing, inventories are increasing. Many fear that the continuous increase in unsold goods will force many industries to reduce production in the near future. This fear exists not only in heavy industries such as steel and automobiles but also in light industries producing consumer goods. According to "Business Week," in the last quarter of 1952, some industries, including oil and coal, already suffered from "excessive" inventories.

    The steel industry has also begun to face the shadow of "overcapacity." The "Wall Street Journal" recently reported that the warehouses of American steel mills are currently about 60% full. The newspaper said that Joseph Block, Vice President of Inland Steel Company, predicts that the operating rate of the steel industry will decrease by about 10% in the second half of this year.

    The automobile industry is also worried about overproduction. "Fortune" magazine predicts that there will be a significant reduction in automobile production in the second half of this year.

    在疯狂扩军备战声中
    美经济下降趋势显明
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：美国的经济形势已引起美国资产阶级经济学家与观察家的深切忧虑。他们认为，尽管政府的备战经费保持很高的水平，美国经济中正在发展的“弱点”，其严重性仍然足以使美国经济有显著下降的可能。
    这些评论家认为，在这些“弱点”中，有些已经形成，有些是在形成的过程中，而且可能在不太久的将来有爆发成为重大破坏力量的危险。在第一类中有：一、农产品价格与农民收入的剧烈下降；二、从去年下半年开始的输出减少。在第二类中有：一、资本投资减少的前景；二、存货增加，钢铁、汽车和其他工业生产过剩的危险；三、消费者债务的剧烈增加及因此引起的国内消费市场萎缩的危险。由于在过去一年中农产品价格下跌了百分之十二，因此，一九五二年农民的纯收入比一九四七年大约减少百分之十五。农业部官员预测：农民的纯收入还要下跌百分之五以上。
    许多评论家在讨论农业情况时都回顾说，三十年代初期的经济大恐慌就是从农业危机开始的。
    农产品输出的减少是美国输出减少的一个原因，但是并不是全部原因。石油、煤炭与其他产品的输出跟谷物与棉花一起减少。据“华尔街日报”估计，如果把军火输出除外，一九五二年的美国输出约比一九五一年减少八亿美元。据全国对外贸易协会副主席约翰·寇克说，专家们估计，今年将再减少大约七亿美元。照寇克看来，今年美国的输出品将遇到“德国与日本的东山再起的出口贸易更大的竞争”。
    在输出减少的同时，存货在增加。许多人害怕卖不出去的货物不断增加在不久的将来将迫使许多工业减少生产。这种恐惧心理不但发生在钢铁与汽车等重工业中，而且也发生在消费品轻工业中。据“商业周刊”说，在一九五二年最后一季，包括石油与煤炭在内的一些工业已感存货“充斥”之苦。
    钢铁工业也已开始面临“过剩”的阴影。“华尔街日报”最近报道说，目前美国钢铁工厂的仓库已经装满了百分之六十左右。该报说，内陆钢铁公司副总经理约瑟夫·布洛克预测，在今年下半年，钢铁业的开工率将减少约百分之十。
    汽车业也在担心生产过剩。“幸福”杂志预测，在今年下半年，汽车生产将有显著的减少。
