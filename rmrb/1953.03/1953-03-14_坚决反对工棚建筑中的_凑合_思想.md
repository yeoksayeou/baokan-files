    Resolutely Oppose the "Good Enough" Mentality in Construction Site Sheds
    The major accident reported in our newspaper today, involving the collapse of construction sheds at the Baguazui site in Huangshi City and the Hongshanmiao site in Changsha, resulting in the death and injury of over 150 workers, has been thoroughly investigated and addressed by local Party, government, and labor union leaders, as well as the Central Labor Department, who have dispatched personnel. However, this remains a crucial lesson that leading cadres in basic construction departments across the country should take to heart.
    As can be seen from the letters of readers Guo Jiguang and Hu Lirong, these two shed collapse accidents occurred under the influence of the same erroneous thinking. This is that the leading cadres of these work areas showed no concern for the lives and safety of the workers, but instead treated the housing of basic construction workers with a "good enough" mentality. They mistakenly believed that construction sheds were temporary and could be "good enough." Therefore, they intentionally used substandard materials in place of good ones, and used bamboo skewers instead of nails. They could erect a house frame on a footing only five centimeters deep, with only a few extremely thin supports, and then load it with more than twenty tons. When the workers reported the dangerous condition of the sheds to the work area leaders and actively put forward suggestions for improvement, these bureaucrats, under the guise of "increasing production and practicing thrift" and "objective difficulties," turned around and asked the workers to overcome the difficulties. What was the result? The sheds collapsed, and the workers suffered undue harm, even sacrificing their lives.
    It should be pointed out that this "good enough" mentality is due to the erroneous view of unilaterally focusing on production and construction tasks while neglecting the lives and safety of the workers. The fact is very clear: any great construction task, without the labor and creativity of the workers, is merely a beautiful design on a blueprint and cannot become a reality. If we do not pay attention to protecting labor, and do not care about the lives and safety of the workers, we will not only fail to complete the country's construction tasks and save the country's expenses, but will also cause enormous waste of financial resources and casualties. This is a serious and direct violation of the interests of the state and the people.
    This year is the first year of the country's first Five-Year Plan, and it is also the period of thawing and commencement of work. An unprecedented scale of labor force is pouring into various basic construction sites. Therefore, learning from the lessons of the Baguazui and Hongshanmiao shed collapse accidents and taking necessary measures to improve the housing conditions of workers in the work areas has particularly important practical significance today. Undeniably, there are some objective difficulties, such as the large number of workers, the short preparation time before the start of work, and the large scale and urgent tasks of the projects; but these are not insurmountable. The key lies in whether the leading cadres of the construction enterprises and basic construction departments solve this problem with an attitude of caring for and being responsible for the workers. To this end, we suggest that local Party committees strengthen their leadership over the relevant departments of basic construction, educate them to correct this erroneous "good enough" mentality, urge them to include shed construction as one of the important contents of basic construction preparation, and suggest that local construction, labor, and trade union departments absorb the spirit and methods of the Beijing Municipality's regulations on the standards for shed construction and determine the minimum standards for general shed construction in the area. Only in this way can we effectively prevent the recurrence of shed collapse accidents and ensure the health and safety of the workers.

### 坚决反对工棚建筑中的“凑合”思想

    坚决反对工棚建筑中的“凑合”思想
    本报今天发表的中南区黄石市八卦嘴、长沙洪山庙两工地因工棚倒塌死伤工人一百五十余名的重大事故，当地党、政、工领导方面和中央劳动部虽然已派人彻底检查处理；但这对各地基本建设部门领导干部来说，仍然是一个应该切实记取的重要教训。
    从读者郭基光、胡立荣的来信中可以看出，这两次工棚倒塌事故，是在同一种错误思想支配之下发生的。这就是这些工区的领导干部对工人的生活和安全毫不关心，而是以一种“凑合”的思想来对待基本建设工人的住宿问题。他们错误地认为工棚是临时性的，能凑合就凑合。因此他们有意用次料顶好料，用竹签子代钉子；他们可以在五公寸深的地脚基础上，用少数几根极细的支柱搭起房架，就让它载重二十多吨。当工人把工棚的危险情况报告工区领导干部，并积极提出改进建议的时候，这些官僚主义者又假借“增产节约”和“客观困难”为名，反过来让工人克服困难。结果怎样呢？工棚倒塌了，工人遭受了不应有的摧残，以致牺牲了生命。
    应该指出，这种“凑合”思想，是由于片面的只顾生产建设任务，而不关心工人的生活和安全的错误观点而产生的。事实很清楚，任何伟大的建设任务，如果没有工人的劳动创造，只不过是蓝图上的美丽设计，而不能成为现实。如果不注意保护劳动、不关心工人的生活和安全，不仅不能完成国家的建设任务，不能为国家节省开支，反而造成极大的财力浪费和人力伤亡。这是严重地、直接地违反了国家和人民利益的错误行为。
    今年是国家第一个五年建设计划开始的一年，现在又正是解冻开工的时期，空前规模的劳动队伍正涌进各个基本建设工地。因此，接受八卦嘴和洪山庙工棚倒塌事故的教训，采取必要措施改善工区工人的住宿条件，在今天就有着特别重要的现实意义。不可否认，客观上是有一些困难的，比如工人人数众多，开工前的准备时间短促，以及工程规模宏大而任务紧急等；但这些都不是不可克服的，关键在于各建筑企业单位和基本建设部门的领导干部是否以关心工人和对工人负责的态度来解决这个问题。为此，我们建议各地党委加强对基本建设有关部门的领导，教育他们纠正这种错误的“凑合”思想，督促他们把工棚建筑列入基本建设准备工作重要内容之一，并建议当地建筑、劳动和工会等部门吸收北京市制定工棚建筑标准规定的精神和办法，确定当地一般工棚建筑的起码标准。这样才可以有效地防止工棚倒塌事故继续发生，才可以保障工人的健康和安全。
