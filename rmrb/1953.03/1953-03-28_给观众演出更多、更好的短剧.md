    Presenting More and Better Short Plays to Audiences

    The Beijing People's Art Theatre's performance of four one-act plays, "Before the Wheat Harvest," "Between Husband and Wife," "A Happy Event," and "Zhao Xiaolan," has been well-received by audiences. This is one of the concrete achievements of the theatre's staff, including playwrights, directors, and actors, who, after undergoing rectification and study of literature and art last year, went down to factories and rural areas to experience life, transform their thinking, and create. In factories and rural areas, they helped workers and farmers with propaganda and mobilization work, and helped them create more than a dozen short plays. "Between Husband and Wife" and "A Happy Event" are two of these short plays, created by the group that went down to the factories.

    "Before the Wheat Harvest" reflects the struggle between advanced and backward ideologies in agricultural production cooperatives. Advanced farmers not only see the benefits of the current cooperative but also see the socialist vision for the future. However, some individual members still have narrow, selfish thoughts, only seeing their own interests. Facts ultimately show that only by subordinating oneself to the interests of the collective can individual interests be guaranteed. The horse feeder Liu Jingquan represents the new ideological outlook of the working people in the new countryside. Liu Laohan’s selflessness and enthusiasm are met with suspicion and misunderstanding from Li Dasao; although Liu Laohan is angry, when he hears that the river has overflowed and Li Dasao’s land is flooded, he still tears down his own wooden planks to block the water. Afterwards, when Li Dasao apologetically apologizes to him, Liu Laohan says, "To be honest, I've already forgotten about it!" Such a straightforward personality and such magnanimity leave a very deep impression on the audience. "Between Husband and Wife" is a very popular program. It depicts a worker who is very active in production and study, and can be called a model worker, but fails to manage his family relationship well because he looks down on his wife. He only sees his own progress and never feels his wife’s progress. It was not until he saw his wife participating in the production team, learning many characters, and being elected as a street sanitation model that he realized his feudal ideas. The playwright uses the worker's daily life: studying, working, attending meetings, sewing clothes, and cooking, to show the feudal male chauvinist ideas that remain in him. Subsequently, the play uses facts to criticize this thought. This remnant of thought is widespread, and judging from the audience's reaction in the theater, one can feel that many people have been hit where it hurts. "A Happy Event" depicts a female worker in a yarn factory who encounters difficulties in her work and hesitates to retreat, requesting a transfer, but later, after being persuaded and educated by the secretary of her workshop's Communist Youth League branch, solves the problem. "Zhao Xiaolan" shows the struggle of new women in the countryside against the old marriage system arranged by their parents. The play's content is relatively rich. The happiness of winning the fight against the old arranged marriage system, the suffering of women who are sacrificed under the old marriage system, the sins of the matchmaker, and the stubbornness of backward figures representing the remnants of feudal forces are all clearly expressed. In the performance, the director and actors adopted a farce-like performance method to perform this play, and individual negative characters adopted the performance methods of clowns in our national classical opera in some performances. Such a performance is still a novel attempt on our new spoken drama stage, but it is familiar to the audience, and the audience accepts the education given by "Zhao Xiaolan" with joy and laughter. Such a performance may somewhat dilute the sharpness of the struggle in real life, but the unreserved satire and moderate exaggeration of the negative characters in the play is still appropriate for this play.

    Although the play and the performance still have shortcomings, it should be said that this performance should be valued. At present, the number of spoken drama scripts available for performance is not large. Playwrights write too little, and they do not pay enough attention to writing small plays and one-act plays. Theaters, actors, and directors often look down on one-act plays, and the staging of one-act plays is often not included in their main business. Now that people's lives are gradually improving, and the broad masses of people have such an urgent demand for culture and art, our theaters and playwrights have a responsibility to spur themselves on. They must not only create and stage multi-act plays, but also not despise small plays and one-act plays, so as to change the current phenomenon of theaters lacking spoken drama performance programs. The Beijing People's Art Theatre's efforts to organize a large number of staff to go deep into the lives of the masses, improve their thinking, give play to everyone's creativity, and actively create and perform better scripts for the masses are welcome and should be encouraged.

### 给观众演出更多、更好的短剧

    给观众演出更多、更好的短剧
    北京人民艺术剧院演出的四个独幕剧：“麦收之前”、“夫妻之间”、“喜事”、“赵小兰”，受到了观众的欢迎。这是剧院工作同志，包括编剧、导演、演员等，在去年经过文艺整风学习后，下厂下乡，体验生活，改造思想，进行创作的具体成绩之一。在工厂和农村中，他们曾帮助工人、农民搞宣传鼓动工作，帮助他们编排了十几个短剧。“夫妻之间”和“喜事”就是这些短剧中的两个，是下厂小组创作的。
    “麦收之前”反映了农业生产合作社里先进的和落后的两种思想的斗争。先进的农民不仅看到目前合作社的好处，而且看到了社会主义的远景。但是个别的社员还有狭隘自私的思想，只看到自己的利益。事实终于表明：只有服从集体的利益，个人的利益才有保证。喂马更倌刘竞全表现了新农村劳动人民的新的思想面貌，刘老汉这样的无私，这样的热情反而换来李大嫂的猜忌和误会；刘老汉虽然气愤，但在听说河水出槽、李大嫂的地被淹时，仍然拆了自家的木板前去堵水。事后李大嫂惭愧地向他道歉时，刘老汉说：“凭良心说，我早就忘了！”这样的爽朗性格，这样的气概，给观众留下一个很深刻的印象。“夫妻之间”是一个很受观众欢迎的节目，它描写一个在生产和学习上都很积极，都能称得起是模范的工人，偏偏由于看不起自己的老婆而搞不好家庭关系。他只看到自己的进步而从来感觉不到老婆的进步。直到看见老婆参加了生产小组，又认识了许多字，又被选为街道卫生模范时，他才认识到了自己的封建思想。剧作者通过这个工人的日常生活：学习，工作，开会，缝衣，做饭，来表现出残存在他身上的轻视妇女的封建的男权思想。随后剧本又用事实来批判了这种思想。这种思想残余是普遍存在着的，从剧场里的观众反应来看，会使人感觉到有不少人是被打中了要害的。“喜事”描写一个纱厂女工在工作中遇到了困难而犹豫退缩，要求调动工作，后来受到她车间团支部书记的说服教育才解决了问题。“赵小兰”表现了农村中新女性对父母包办的旧婚姻制度的不屈服的斗争。剧本内容比较丰富。向旧的买卖婚姻进行斗争而得到胜利的幸福与牺牲在旧的婚姻制度之下的妇女的痛苦，媒婆的罪恶和代表残余封建势力的落后人物的顽固，都鲜明地表现出来了。在演出中，导演和演员采用了闹剧的排演方法来演这个剧，个别反面人物在若干表演上采用了我们民族古典戏曲中丑角的表演方法。这样的演法在我们的新的话剧舞台上还是新颖的尝试，然而对观众说来却是熟悉的，观众用愉快和欢笑接受了“赵小兰”给予的教育。这样的表演可能会多少冲淡了现实生活中斗争的尖锐程度，但是对剧中反面人物的不留情面的讽刺和适度的夸张，应用在这一剧上还是合适的。
    尽管剧本和演出还有缺点，但应该说，这次的演出是应该重视的。目前可供上演的话剧剧本的数量不多，剧作家写得太少，对于一些小型的戏、独幕剧的写作更重视不够。剧团、演员与导演也常常菲薄独幕剧，对于独幕剧的排演常常不打在主要的业务之内。在人民生活逐渐提高的现在，广大人民对文化与艺术的要求如此迫切，我们的剧院和剧作家就有责任鞭策自己，既要创作和上演多幕剧，也不应轻视小戏和独幕剧，以改变目前剧院缺乏话剧上演节目的现象。北京人民艺术剧院此次组织大部工作人员深入群众生活，提高思想，发挥大家的创造力，积极为群众创作和演出比较好的剧本，这种努力是值得欢迎和鼓励的。
