How to Do a Good Job in Training Grassroots Cadres
Hebei Daily Editorial, February 21st

Editor's Note: This editorial from the Hebei Daily provides some important methods and experiences for training grassroots cadres in the implementation of the Marriage Law. This editorial played a promoting role in the work of training grassroots cadres in Hebei Province. It is now reprinted for reference in various regions.

In order to launch a mass movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law throughout the province, various localities are now starting to train grassroots cadres. Tens of thousands of village (street) cadres (branch secretaries, village heads, heads of women's federations, secretaries of the Communist Youth League, heads of preaching stations, core propagandists, etc.) have already been concentrated for training or are being concentrated. As the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has pointed out: "It is imperative to conscientiously do a good job in the training of grassroots cadres, which is not only a key link in determining the success or failure of this movement, but will also directly affect the regular implementation of the Marriage Law." Therefore, leading organs in all parts of the province must attach great importance to this and ensure that the training of grassroots cadres, this crucial work, is done well. If the training of grassroots cadres is not taken seriously, and is treated as a mere formality or done carelessly, it will not only waste manpower and resources, but will also constitute an unforgivable act of bureaucraticism.

For the training of grassroots cadres (including both concentrated training of main village (street) cadres and core propagandists, and universal training of all cadres and propagandists without leaving production), whether concentrated or universal training is adopted, and no matter what method or form is taken, it must be personally led by the county (city) party committee, and sufficient county and district cadres must be organized to do the tutoring work. This is the prerequisite for running a good training class. The method adopted by Qingyuan County, where two members of the county party committee took charge, and thirty cadres from county-level organs and almost all district-level cadres assisted in training village cadres, is worthy of learning by other regions.

After having sufficient leadership strength, how can the training work be done well?

First, the lectures must be good. First of all, do not list the three requirements put forward at the provincial cadre meeting on implementing the Marriage Law (clarify the guiding principles, nature, objectives, and policies; draw a clear line between feudal ideas; learn specific practices, etc.) as equal, but must focus on concentrating efforts to solve the ideological problems of cadres and improve their ideological awareness, otherwise the expected results cannot be achieved. The articles and teaching materials of the Marriage Law can be used as the basis for lectures, but should not be read verbatim. Through this concentrated and universal training, all grassroots cadres should establish three new basic viewpoints, eradicate three roots, and settle three accounts. That is to say: 1. Establish the viewpoint of equality between men and women, eradicate the root of male chauvinism, and calculate whether women are "capable" or not. Originally, there were only physiological differences between women and men, but no differences in personality. Women and men have the same abilities in all aspects of social labor. In the long era before class society, it was centered on women. Since the emergence of class society, especially since the feudal society, under the rule of feudal morality, especially under the constraints of the old marriage system and family relations, women have been unable to hold their heads high for thousands of years. This has greatly restricted the scope of women's labor and activities, and thus restricted the development of women's wisdom, forming many weaknesses of women today. Are women "incapable"? Absolutely not. In fact, women not only bear heavy housework and become an indispensable and important member of the family division of labor, but also many women can undertake field labor and become model workers. Since the founding of New China, tens of thousands of women have participated in the glorious work of national economic construction and national defense construction. It can be seen that it is not that women are fundamentally incapable, but the result of long-term rule by old feudal customs. If they are placed in the same conditions as men, their abilities are no worse than men's. 2. Establish the viewpoint of democratic harmony and unity in production, eradicate the root of patriarchal rule and parental rule, and calculate the losses caused by family disharmony, mental unhappiness, and serious impact on production, so that everyone can realize the harm of the old feudal patriarchal rule and parental rule, the benefits of a democratic family, and learn the methods of democratic housekeeping. 3. Establish the viewpoint that free marriage is progressive, correct, and legal, eradicate the roots of feudal arranged, mercenary, and forced marriages, and calculate why couples are not harmonious, why male-female relations are chaotic, and why some people commit suicide or are killed because of lack of freedom in marriage. The more lively, vivid, and powerful such education is, the more it can touch people's hearts and enlighten people's consciousness, and then they will deeply examine their thoughts, examine the implementation of the Marriage Law, and further understand the guiding principles and policies, and make a good plan for the work of publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law.

Second, holding good group discussions is the second important link in running a good training class. It is not easy to lead and organize group discussions. Discussion is an important method directly related to the trainees' comprehension of the courses taught. Many regions have already had successful experiences in this regard. We believe that to hold good group discussions, it is necessary for county and district cadres to personally participate in the groups, focus on mastering the situation, create and absorb experience, and disseminate it in a timely manner to expand the impact. In the discussion, it is imperative to connect with thoughts and connect with reality. The group leader should pay attention to grasping the key issues that are common and essential, organize and expand the discussion, trace the root of the problem, and do not let trivial issues that are not of overall importance take up too much time. For wrong ideas, do not rush to criticize, but should patiently guide and enlighten, and guide cadres to be conscious. In the discussion, attention should also be paid to discovering cadres who are enthusiastic about freedom of marriage, democratic and harmonious families, and those who thoroughly awakened from feudal ideas, help them improve their understanding, and organize them to make typical reports to all cadres. These vivid examples should be used to enlighten the trainees to conduct discussions and enlighten them to be aware. In short, group meetings must be held well.

Third, help village cadres make plans for returning to the village to work. This mainly includes a publicity plan for returning to the village and a work plan for regularly implementing the Marriage Law (including plans for combining production and promoting other work). This plan must be realistic and feasible. County and district cadres should focus on providing assistance, and make typical reports to the conference on the work plans of good villages, preaching stations, and individuals, in order to disseminate experience.

Finally, let me repeat: Doing a good job in the training of grassroots cadres is an important link in the healthy development of the movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law. All regions must do it conscientiously. Those who have poorly planned should quickly enrich and revise their plans; those who are holding training classes should implement the above-mentioned spirit; those who have not held training classes must make up for it in universal training.

    怎样做好集训基层干部的工作
    河北日报二月二十一日社论
    编者按：河北日报的这篇社论，提供了贯彻婚姻法中训练基层干部的一些重要方法和经验。这篇社论在河北省训练基层干部的工作中，曾起了推动作用。现予以转载，供各地参考。
    为了在全省范围内开展一个宣传贯彻婚姻法的群众运动，现在各地正在着手进行基层干部的训练工作。十数万村（街）干部（支部书记、村长、妇联会主任、团委书记、传授站长、宣传员骨干等），已经集中训练或正在集中。正如中共河北省委指示的：“务期认真做好基层干部的训练工作，这不但是决定这一运动成败的环节，而且将直接关系到婚姻法的经常贯彻。”因此，全省各地领导机关，务必提起高度重视，保证做好基层干部的训练这一带关键性的工作。如果对于这次训练基层干部的工作不重视，例行公事，潦草马虎，则不仅会劳民伤财，而且将犯不可饶恕的官僚主义错误。
    对于基层干部的训练（包括集中训练村（街）主要干部、宣传员骨干和不脱离生产的普遍训练全体干部、宣传员两种方法），不论集训和普训，也不管采取那一种方法和方式，都必须由县（市）委亲自主持领导，并组织足够的县区干部做辅导工作。这是办好训练班的前提。清苑县以两个县委委员主持，由三十个县级机关的干部并几乎是所有的区级干部力量，辅助训练村干部的办法，是值得各地学习的。
    在有了足够的领导力量之后，怎样做好训练工作呢？
    第一、要讲好课。首先不要把全省贯彻婚姻法扩大干部会议所提出的三点要求（明确方针性质、目的、政策；划清与封建的思想界限；学会具体做法等）平列起来，而必须把重点放在集中力量解决干部的思想问题、提高思想觉悟方面，不然就不能收到预期效果。对于婚姻法条例、教材，可作为讲课的依据，但不要照本宣读。应经过这次集训和普训，使所有基层干部，都树立三个新的基本观点，刨掉三个根，算清三笔账。就是说：一、树立男女平等的观点，刨掉男尊女卑的根子，算一算妇女究竟“行不行”的账。本来，妇女和男人只有生理上的区别，而没有人格上的差异，妇女和男人在社会劳动各方面有同样的能力，在阶级社会以前很长的年代里，是以女性为中心的。自从阶级社会产生以来，特别是自从封建社会以来，在封建道德统治下，特别在旧的婚姻制度与家庭关系的束缚下，使妇女几千年抬不起头来，这样，才大大限制了妇女的劳动与活动的范围，因而也就限制了妇女的智慧的发挥，形成了妇女现有的许多弱点。妇女是不是“不行”呢？绝不是的。事实上，妇女不但担负了沉重的家务劳动，成为家庭分工所不能缺少的重要成员，而且有不少妇女还可以担负田间劳动，并能成为劳动模范。新中国成立之后，已有成千上万的妇女，参加了国家经济建设与国防建设的光荣工作。由此可见，不是妇女根本不行，而是长期受旧的封建礼俗统治的结果。如与男人处在相同的条件下，她们的能力并不比男子差。二、树立民主和睦、团结生产的观点，刨掉夫权统治、家长统治的根子，算一算因为家庭不和睦、精神不愉快以致严重影响了生产的账，从而使人人认识到旧的封建的夫权统治和家长统治的害处，和民主家庭的好处，与学习民主管家的方法。三、树立自由婚姻是进步的、正确的、合法的观点，刨掉封建包办、买卖与强迫婚姻的根子，算一算为什么夫妇不和睦，为什么男女关系乱，为什么有些人因婚姻不自由而自杀、被杀的账。这种教育越进行得活泼生动有力，才越能打动人们的心，启发人们的自觉，然后才会深刻地检查思想，检查执行婚姻法的情况，才能进一步地领会方针、政策，把宣传贯彻婚姻法的工作计划做好。
    第二、开好小组讨论会是办好训练班第二个重要环节。要领导组织好小组讨论，是个不容易的事情。讨论会是直接关系到受训干部对所讲课程领会贯通的重要方法。这点，各地已有许多成功经验。我们认为要开好小组讨论会，必须：县、区干部亲自参加小组，重点掌握，创造和吸取经验，及时传播，扩大影响。在讨论中务必联系思想，联系实际。小组长要注意抓住带普遍性和本质性的关键问题，组织展开讨论，追本求源，不要把无关大体的琐碎问题占去过多的时间。对于错误思想不要急于批判，而应循循善诱，耐心启发，引导干部自觉。在讨论中，还应注意随时发现婚姻自由、民主和睦家庭和对自由婚姻热心支持的干部和有封建思想而彻底觉悟的干部，帮助他们提高认识，组织他们向全体干部作典型报告。应该用这些活生生的事例启发学员进行讨论，启发他们觉悟。总之，必须把小组会开好。
    第三、帮助村干部作好回村工作的计划。主要是回村的宣传计划和经常贯彻婚姻法的工作计划（包括结合生产和推动其他工作的计划）。这种计划，必须是实事求是，切实可行的。县区干部应有重点的进行帮助，并把好的村庄的、传授站的、个人的工作计划，一并向大会做典型报告，以传播经验。
    最后，再重复一句：做好基层干部的训练工作，是健康地开展宣传贯彻婚姻法运动的重要环节，各地务必认真做好。凡是计划不周的，应迅速充实、修订计划；凡是正召开集训班的，都应贯彻上述精神；凡是没有办好集训班的，一定要在普训中进行补课。
