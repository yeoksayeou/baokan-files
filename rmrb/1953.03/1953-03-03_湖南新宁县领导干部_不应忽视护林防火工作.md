Leading Cadres of Xinning County, Hunan Province, Should Not Neglect Forest Fire Prevention

Leading cadres of the People's Government of Xinning County, Hunan Province, neglect forest fire prevention work and refuse to implement the forest fire prevention instructions issued by the People's Government of Hunan Province. The county head is unwilling to discuss and arrange forest fire prevention work with comrades sent by the Forestry Bureau of the People's Government of Hunan Province and the Shaoyang Prefectural Office to assist. Secretary Wang of the County People's Government also said: "Forest fire prevention is indeed an important task for your Forestry Bureau, but it becomes a secondary or even more minor task in Xinning." Liu Houquan, a clerk in the County Construction Section, even made a long-distance call to the Shaoyang Prefectural Office on December 3 last year, asking the Prefectural Office to transfer the cadres assisting in the county back, so as not to disrupt their central work.

On December 11 last year, the Shaoyang Prefectural Office issued a circular criticizing some facts about Xinning County's neglect of forestry work. Chen Zimin, deputy section chief of the County Construction Section, not only did not humbly examine himself after receiving the circular, but instead said in a scolding tone: The forestry cadres are really troublemakers, next time they come to Xinning we will definitely make them live in the common room.

A more serious manifestation of the county's neglect of forestry work is sitting idly by while mountain fires spread. In early January of this year, the mountain fire at Anxinguanshan in Yongping Township, Xinning County, burned continuously for three days and three nights, destroying more than 100 mu of mountain forest. The leading cadres of the county neither promptly organized the masses to put out the fire and investigate the cause, nor did they report to the higher-level government.

### 湖南新宁县领导干部  不应忽视护林防火工作

    湖南新宁县领导干部
    不应忽视护林防火工作
    湖南省新宁县人民政府领导干部忽视护林防火工作，拒不执行湖南省人民政府颁发的护林防火指示。该县县长不愿和省人民政府林业局及邵阳专署派去协助工作的同志共同商量布置护林防火工作。县人民政府王秘书也说：“护林防火，对于你们林业局的确是重要的工作，但拿到新宁就成了一个次要而又次要的工作了。”县建设科的科员刘厚泉在去年十二月三日还向邵阳专署打长途电话，要专署把在该县协助工作的干部调回去，以免打乱他们的中心工作。
    去年十二月十一日，邵阳专署针对新宁县忽视林业工作的一些事实加以通报批评。该县建设科副科长陈自敏在接到通报后，不但不虚心检查，反而用谩骂的口吻说：林业干部真是捣鬼，下次再到新宁硬叫他们住伙铺。
    该县忽视林业工作更严重的表现，是坐视山火蔓延而不管。今年一月上旬新宁县拥平乡安心观的山火连续燃烧了三天三夜，烧毁山林面积约一百多亩。该县领导干部对此次山火既不及时组织群众扑救和追查发生原因，也不报告上级政府。
