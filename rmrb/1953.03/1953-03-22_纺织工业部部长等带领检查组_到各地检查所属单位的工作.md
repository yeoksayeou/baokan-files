The Minister of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, Jiang Guangnai, Deputy Minister Qian Zhiguang, and directors of the Planning Department, Basic Construction Bureau, and other departments and bureaus, personally led four inspection teams, starting from the 11th of this month, to inspect subordinate units in Tianjin, Yuci, Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Harbin, and other places. The inspection content in terms of basic construction mainly involved inspecting the various preparatory works before the construction of new factories and helping them solve the difficulties encountered in the preparatory work. In terms of production, with the Tianjin area as the focus, the main inspections involved how various factories mobilized the masses to discuss and revise this year's production plans, and to understand whether the production plans were comprehensive and whether they integrated the three aspects of completing output, improving quality, and reducing costs. The inspection teams demanded to deeply discover problems, exchange experiences in a timely manner, and achieve the goal of making the plans more realistic and ensuring their implementation.
