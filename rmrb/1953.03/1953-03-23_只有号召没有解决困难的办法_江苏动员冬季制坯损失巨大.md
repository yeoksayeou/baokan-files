Only Appeals, No Solutions to Difficulties
Jiangsu's Winter Brickmaking Mobilization Results in Huge Losses

    The Jiangsu Provincial Finance Committee was responsible for supplying the Shanghai area with 100 million bricks and 17 million tiles in 1953. To this end, on November 25th of last year, a brick and tile conference was held in Suzhou for the area east of Suzhou (between Shanghai and Suzhou). The meeting decided to break with past practice and launch a crash program for winter brickmaking.
    (Generally, factory kilns stop production in mid-November each year, and brickmakers generally stop making bricks at the end of October.) After the meeting, the county Party committees in various brick and tile producing areas mobilized public and private factory kilns and brickmakers to rush winter brickmaking. The Suzhou Special District even launched a brickmaking campaign. However, because there were only general appeals, and the potential difficulties in winter brickmaking were not sufficiently estimated, nor were any solutions devised, serious brick freezing occurred in various places after the temperature dropped below zero. On January 3rd, Wujiang County mobilized 4,493 brickmakers to make 868,031 brick blanks, but 40 percent were lost by the 16th, with a value of 10,416,360 yuan. The Shanghai County Private Taishan Brick and Tile Factory, which had the most advanced equipment in the country, had 80,000 to 100,000 tile blanks frozen, worth over 40 million yuan. The Suzhou City Machinery Kiln Factory had about 10,000 tile blanks frozen. The Kunshan County Public-Private Joint Venture Zhenxing Brick and Tile Factory lost more than 1 million brick blanks. The losses of the Zhensu Machine Brick Factory were even greater, reaching 1.6 billion yuan.
    The phenomenon of frozen bricks was not only very serious in the area east of Suzhou, but also in many other areas. Since the decision was made at the provincial basic construction conference last December to adopt a zonal contracting system for the supply of construction materials such as bricks, tiles, sand, and stone, various places have been making bricks in winter. The Nanjing Public-Private Joint Venture Xinning Brick and Tile Factory had 300,000 brick blanks frozen, worth 21 million yuan. The Nanjing Construction Company's First Factory had 140,000 brick blanks frozen, worth 9.8 million yuan. The Xinsheng Brick and Tile Factory made 34,287 brick blanks indoors, but the blanks near the fire cracked, and the blanks far from the fire were frozen, resulting in a loss of one-half, worth 7.1 million yuan.
    The large-scale freezing of brick and tile blanks has brought serious losses to the state and the brickmaking masses. The Jiangsu Provincial Finance Committee and others must do a good job of handling the aftermath.

    只有号召没有解决困难的办法
    江苏动员冬季制坯损失巨大
    江苏省财委一九五三年负责供应上海地区一亿块砖、一千七百万张瓦。为此，去年十一月二十五日，在苏州召开了苏州以东地区（上海至苏州间）砖瓦会议。会上决定打破历年惯例，突击冬季制坯。
    （一般厂窑在每年十一月中旬停止生产、坯农一般在十月底停止打坯。）会后各砖瓦产地县委分别动员各公、私厂窑、坯农突击冬季制坯；苏州专区并展开制坯运动。但是，由于只有一般号召，而对冬季制坯中可能产生的困难没有足够估计，也没有想出一套解决困难的办法，因此到气温降至零度以下后，各地陆续发生了严重的冻坯现象。吴江县一月三日动员坯农四千四百九十三人，制砖坯八十六万八千零三十一块，十六日损失百分之四十，价值一千零四十一万六千三百六十元。全国设备最新的上海县私营泰山砖瓦厂，冻坏瓦坯八万到十万张，价值四千多万元。苏州市机制窑厂冻坏瓦坯一万张左右。昆山县公私合营的振兴砖瓦厂损失砖坯一百多万块。振苏机砖厂的损失更多达十六亿元。
    冻坯现象不但在苏州以东地区非常严重，其他地区也不少。从去年十二月全省基本建设会议上确定砖、瓦、沙、石等建筑材料供应采取分区包干制后，各地纷纷在冬季制坯。南京公私合营的新宁砖瓦厂冻坏砖坯三十万块，价值两千一百万元。南京建筑公司第一厂冻坏砖坯十四万块，价值九百八十万元。新生砖瓦厂在室内做砖坯三万四千二百八十七块，结果近火的砖坯发裂；离火远的砖坯被冻坏，损失二分之一，价值七百一十万元。
    由于大批砖瓦坯冻坏，给国家和制砖群众带来了严重损失，江苏省财委等必须很好的进行善后处理工作。
