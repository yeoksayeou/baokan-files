    Beijing Municipal Cooperative Headquarters Inspects and Handles People's Letters

    A letter from the Beijing Municipal Cooperative Headquarters Correspondence Group: Recently, the Beijing Municipal Cooperative Headquarters inspected the work of handling people's letters and found that cadres had very confused understandings of the work of handling people's letters, and many problems raised by the people had not been dealt with. For example, some cadres treat handling people's letters as a "chore"; they do it when they have time, and put it aside when they don't. Some cadres get angry and ignore letters when they see discrepancies with the facts. Some even say that the masses are "specifically finding fault." Some take a "case-by-case" attitude when handling people's letters: for example, a member of the Xuanwu District Cooperative wrote to point out that the containers for selling vinegar at the 53rd Distribution Point were small and the quantity was insufficient. As a result, they only replaced the containers for selling vinegar at that point, but did not check the containers for selling peanut oil, soy sauce, etc., which were also small. Of course, they did not bother to check the situation at other distribution points. Furthermore, the masses in Sihaizhuang, Nanyuan District, reported that a member went to the local cooperative to buy "Ten Drops of Water" (a medicine), but the salesperson gave him "DDT"; an elementary school student bought a pencil, but the salesperson gave him a thermos; a member bought 400 catties of bran, but the salesperson gave him 800 catties. Furthermore, members of the Xisi District once reported that the accounts of Yuan Qingfu, the manager of the 44th Distribution Point of the district cooperative, were unclear. All of these have not been thoroughly dealt with until recently. After this inspection, the relevant cadres corrected their wrong ideas and formulated practical measures to improve the handling of people's letters.

### 北京市合作总社检查处理人民来信工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    北京市合作总社检查处理人民来信工作
    北京市合作总社通讯组来信：最近，北京市合作总社对处理人民来信工作作了检查，发现干部对处理人民来信工作的认识很混乱，并且有不少人民群众提出的问题还没处理。如有的干部把处理人民来信当成“应差”；有工夫办一下，没工夫就压下来。有的干部看到来信与事实稍有不符，就大发脾气，不理不睬。也有的说，群众是“专门找错”。有的在处理人民来信时采取“就事论事”的态度：如宣武区合作社，社员来信提出第五十三分销处卖醋的容器小，分量不够，结果他们只把该处卖醋的容器换了一下，却没有检查出该处卖花生油、酱油等的容器，也有小的。当然他们更没有注意到去检查其他分销处的情况。又，南苑区四海庄群众反映：一社员到当地合作社买“十滴水”，售货员却给了“滴滴涕”；一小学生买铅笔，售货员却给了暖水瓶；一社员买四百斤麸皮，售货员却给成八百斤。再如西四区社员曾经检举该区合作社第四十四分销处经理袁庆福的账目不清。这些，都直到最近还没有彻底处理。经过这次检查，有关干部才纠正了错误思想，订了切实改进处理人民来信的办法。
