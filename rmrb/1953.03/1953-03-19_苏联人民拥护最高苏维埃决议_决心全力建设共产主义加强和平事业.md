    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 17th (TASS dispatch): The Soviet people wholeheartedly endorse the resolutions adopted by the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Soviet men and women believe that these important resolutions of their supreme state authority express their fervent desire to victoriously complete the historic tasks facing the Soviet Union.
    In Moscow, personnel from various factories, construction sites, and institutions have held meetings one after another to celebrate the convening of the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Attendees expressed their firm determination to build communism on Soviet soil with all their might. Zhuchkov, a Stakhanovite worker and grinder operator in the tool workshop of the State-owned First Ball Bearing Manufacturing Plant, said: The resolutions of the meeting are filled with concern for the strength of our motherland and the happiness of the Soviet people of all nationalities. We must increase labor productivity and victoriously complete the great task of building communism. He pledged to complete at least 300 percent of his quota during each work shift and challenged all the workers in the factory. At the Berezhkovsk embankment, construction site workers, after excitedly reading the documents of the meeting, proposed even higher production quotas. Foreman Poleshchuk said, We are a peace-loving people. We fully support the policy of maintaining and consolidating international peace and the policy of international cooperation pursued by our Communist Party and the Soviet government. To strengthen the cause of peace, we must work better. Every new house is our contribution to the struggle for peace. I guarantee to complete one and a half to two quotas every day, and I guarantee excellent work quality.
    The residents of Leningrad warmly endorse the resolutions passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, saying that they will unite more closely around the Communist Party and the Soviet government. Nazarov, a Stakhanovite worker at the Red Excavator Factory, said at a general meeting of the factory's staff: We want to assure our Party and government that we will devote all our efforts to completing the Fifth Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The factory's staff also made specific guarantees to complete the first four months' plan ahead of schedule.
    In these days, workers in many factories in Kiev have increased their production quotas. A fervent socialist competition is unfolding in all enterprises in Latvia.
