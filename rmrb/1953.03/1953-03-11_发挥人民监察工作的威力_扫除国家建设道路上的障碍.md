    The Second National Supervision Work Conference convened by the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council, based on the current needs of national construction work, has defined the task of supervision work as overseeing and ensuring the implementation of national policies and laws and the accurate completion of construction plans. This requires people's supervision organs to promptly expose the bureaucratic work style of leading organs and leading cadres at all levels, the serious phenomena of commandism and violation of laws and discipline in grassroots organizations and among grassroots cadres, the anarchism and lack of discipline in financial, economic, cultural, and educational departments, especially financial and economic departments, which violate national construction plans, economic accounting systems, security systems, and financial systems, as well as policies and laws, the phenomena of corruption and waste among state personnel, and the phenomena of leaking state secrets. It also requires them to conduct timely and correct handling, unleash the power of supervision work, uphold national laws and discipline, sweep away obstacles on the road of national construction, and improve the work efficiency and sense of responsibility of state personnel.
    This is a glorious and arduous task. To accomplish this task, people's supervision organs must possess a high degree of adherence to principles and a spirit of struggle. In our leading organs and grassroots organizations at all levels, phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of laws and discipline are still quite prevalent and serious. It is extremely difficult and long-term to fight against these phenomena. This not only requires overcoming the resistance of staff members who have committed these errors but also overcoming the emotions of accommodation, leniency, and cover-up by leading cadres at all levels. If supervision organs lack the spirit of persistent struggle, they will never be able to overcome these bad phenomena. In the past three years, especially since the "Three-Anti" movement, many supervision personnel have conducted persistent struggles against various violations and dereliction of duty and have achieved considerable results. However, there are still many supervision personnel who lack this spirit, and they often harbor emotions of accommodation and leniency toward cadres who have committed serious errors, especially veteran cadres and senior cadres who have made contributions in the past. They are afraid of damaging "relationships" and being "given a hard time," so they adopt a vulgar attitude, procrastinate for a long time, and let things go unresolved; or they only expose the errors of lower-level cadres, while turning a blind eye to errors committed by cadres at the same level or higher levels. The error of forcing the masses to remove mixed cotton in Shandong Province occurred in nine special districts and was a common error. One of the important reasons for this was that the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry had issued a general instruction to "resolutely eliminate mixed cotton." The fact that the Department of Agriculture and Forestry arbitrarily issued such an erroneous instruction was inseparable from the phenomenon of decentralism that existed in the Shandong Provincial People's Government. Zhang Zuochen, the former county head of Cangshan County, disregarded the fact that the masses were about to suffer serious losses and stubbornly forced the removal of cotton, and should be punished; however, the provincial supervisory organ did not insist on investigating the responsibility that the Department of Agriculture and Forestry should bear for issuing erroneous instructions when dealing with the Zhang Zuochen issue, nor did it make a serious criticism of the phenomenon of decentralism in the provincial leading organs, which was a manifestation of insufficient fighting spirit. There are many similar phenomena in the supervisory organs in other regions. This situation will inevitably create some illusions among cadres and the masses, arouse suspicion and dissatisfaction, and prevent the problems from being completely resolved. There are also many supervisory organs that make decisions but cannot insist on their implementation. In 1951, Yang Lu, the county head of Xinyang County, Henan Province, committed serious errors in attacking and retaliating against cadres, and the Provincial Supervisory Committee decided to remove him from his post that year. But to this day, it has not been implemented. The reason is that the Xinyang Special Prefecture and the Xinyang Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did not agree to the implementation, and the Provincial Supervisory Committee did not insist on fighting. This cannot but greatly affect the power of supervision work and the role of the supervisory organs.
    In order to overcome these phenomena, it is necessary to educate supervisory cadres and make everyone confirm that their work has only one principle, that is, the interests of the country and the people; besides this, there should not be and should not be any other principles. The contributions of cadres in the past should be correctly assessed; but when their actions harm the interests of the country and the people, they must be resolutely exposed and dealt with, and those whose illegal behavior is extremely serious or who persist in their errors and refuse to correct them should be resolutely removed. Work relationships should be managed well, but this relationship should be combined with irreconcilable struggles on matters of principle, and should not become a vulgar relationship of peaceful coexistence with bad people and bad deeds. As for concerns about being "given a hard time," such concerns should be completely eliminated. As long as you can persevere in the struggle, those who like to "give others a hard time" are bound to fail. Because the Central Committee and Chairman Mao are supporting us. The problem is to stand up by yourself, not to lie down. Those who still cannot adhere to the principles of struggle after education should be considered to have poor political quality or be incapable of fulfilling their responsibilities. These people cannot serve in supervisory work and should be removed.
    In specific work, it is necessary to combine with the central tasks of the time and place, grasp the main trends, concentrate forces, and conduct inspections and handling of typical events with emphasis, gain experience, and promote the general. The handling of the Zhang Shunyou incident in North China, the handling of the Ji Kaifu incident in Central South, and the handling of the Huang Yifeng incident in East China are all successful examples. The handling of these incidents has promoted the inspection and handling of many similar incidents in various places, and has played a major role in overcoming bureaucracy and suppressing criticism. Some supervisory organs in some areas do not understand this method of work, and simply handle cases passively, without purpose, without a plan, piecemeal, and with small hands and feet. As a result, the same amount of time and energy is spent, but it cannot correct serious deviations and cannot solve major problems. This kind of clericalism should be changed quickly.
    Attracting the broad masses to participate in supervising the work of state personnel and combining self-initiated criticism and accusations from below with inspection and supervision from above is the main key to whether supervisory organs can complete their tasks. The facts since the "Three-Anti" movement fully illustrate this issue. Therefore, people's supervisory organs must pay close attention to strengthening the work of people's complaint reception rooms, people's suggestion boxes, and people's inquiry offices, improving the work of people's supervisory correspondents, and improving the handling of letters from the general public. The situation of various agencies in carrying out these tasks should also be inspected and promoted at any time, urging them to handle people's complaints and other requests for resolution in a timely and correct manner. At the same time, it is necessary to take advantage of various opportunities to actively visit the masses, publicize the nature and tasks of the supervisory organs to the masses, and call on the masses to boldly expose the errors of any state personnel. Only by doing these tasks well can supervisory organs discover problems in all aspects in a timely manner; it is difficult to do so relying solely on supervisory correspondents and supervisory organ cadres.
    Party and government leading organs and leading cadres at all levels should see that supervision work is helping themselves to discover the problems existing in work and among cadres and promoting improvement; therefore, they should support this work, support the supervisory organs in fighting against all those who violate laws and neglect their duties, actively establish and improve supervisory institutions, cultivate and equip supervisory cadres, and discuss and inspect supervision work, providing supervision personnel with all aspects of convenience to carry out their work. In some areas, party and government leading organs do not discuss or inspect supervision work; some have the conditions to establish supervisory organs but have not established them; some have established organs but have no full-time cadres; some have equipped cadres, but many of them are not qualified. These problems should be helped to be resolved by leading organs in various places in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    发挥人民监察工作的威力
    扫除国家建设道路上的障碍
    政务院人民监察委员会召开的第二次全国监察工作会议，根据目前国家建设工作的需要，规定了监察工作的任务，是监督与保证国家政策法令的贯彻执行和建设计划的准确完成。这就要求人民监察机关对于各级领导机关和领导干部中的官僚主义作风，对于基层组织和基层干部中的命令主义和违法乱纪的严重现象，对于各级财政经济、文教部门特别是财政经济部门中违背国家建设计划、违背经济核算制度、违背保安制度、违背财政制度、以及违背政策法令的无政府、无纪律现象，对于国家工作人员中的贪污浪费现象和泄露国家机密的现象，要及时地予以揭发，并进行及时的正确的处理，发挥监察工作的威力，严肃国家法纪，扫除国家建设道路上的障碍，提高国家工作人员的工作效率和工作责任心。
    这是一个光荣的艰巨的任务。人民监察机关要完成这个任务，必须有高度的坚持原则斗争的精神。在我们各级领导机关和基层组织中，官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象至今仍然是相当普遍和严重的。和这些现象进行斗争，是十分艰苦的长期的。这不但必须克服犯有这些错误的工作人员的抵抗，而且必须克服各级领导干部的姑息迁就情绪和包庇纵容态度。监察机关如果没有坚持斗争的精神，就决不能克服这些坏的现象。过去三年间，尤其在“三反”运动以来，许多监察工作人员曾经和各种违法失职现象进行了坚持的斗争，取得不少成绩。但是也还有许多监察工作人员还缺乏这种精神，对于犯有严重错误的干部，尤其是其中曾经有过功劳的老干部、大干部，往往抱着姑息与迁就的情绪。他们怕搞坏“关系”，怕“穿小鞋”，就采取庸俗态度，长期拖延，不了了之；或者只对下级干部的错误进行揭发，对同级、上级干部所犯的错误则置若罔闻。山东省强迫群众拔除杂棉的错误发生在九个专区，是普遍性的错误，其重要原因之一是省农林厅有过“坚决铲除杂棉”的笼统指示。而农林厅擅自发布这样的错误指示，又是和山东省人民政府中存在的分散主义现象分不开的。苍山县前县长张作臣眼看群众要遭受严重损失而不顾，蛮横地强迫拔棉，是应该受到处分的；但该省的监察机关在处理张作臣的问题时，没有坚持追究农林厅发布错误指示所应负的责任，也没有对该省领导机关中的分散主义现象提出严正的批评，则是斗争精神不足的表现。在其他地区的监察机关中，也有不少类似的现象。这种情形，必然会造成干部和群众的某些错觉，引起怀疑和不满，并使问题得不到彻底解决。还有许多监察机关作了决定却不能坚持执行。河南省信阳县长杨鹿一九五一年犯有打击、报复干部的严重错误，省监察委员会当年就决定撤他的职。但时至今日，仍然没有执行。原因是信阳专署和中共信阳地方委员会不同意执行，而省监察委员会也没有坚持斗争。这就不能不大大地影响到监察工作的威力和监察机关的作用。
    为了克服这些现象，必须在监察干部中进行教育，使大家确认自己的工作只有一个原则，那就是国家和人民的利益；除此以外再不能有也不应该有任何其他的原则。干部过去有过功劳，应该予以正确估计；但当他们的行为危害国家人民利益的时候，就必须坚决揭发处理，其违法行为的性质极为严重，或坚持错误拒不改正者，还应坚决把他们撤下来。工作关系应该搞好，但这种关系应该是和原则问题上的不调和的斗争结合在一起的，不应该变成和坏人坏事和平共居的庸俗关系，至于怕“穿小鞋”之类的顾虑，更应彻底扫清。只要自己能坚持斗争，爱给人家“穿小鞋”的人是一定要失败的。因为有中央和毛主席在支持我们。问题是要自己站起来，不要躺下去。经过教育而仍然不能坚持原则斗争的人，应该认为是政治品质差，或者能力不能胜任。这些人是不能担任监察工作的，应该把他们撤下来。
    在具体的工作中，应该结合当时当地的中心任务，抓住主要倾向，集中力量，有重点地进行典型事件的检查处理，取得经验，推动一般。华北处理张顺有事件，中南处理纪凯夫事件，华东处理黄逸峰事件，都是成功的范例。这些事件的处理，推动各地检查处理了许多类似的事件，在克服官僚主义与压制批评方面起了重大的作用。有些地区的监察机关不懂得这种工作方法，单纯地被动地处理案件，无目的，无计划，零打碎敲，小手小脚，结果是花费了同样的时间和精力，却不能纠正严重的偏向，不能解决主要的问题。这种事务主义的作法，应该迅速改变。
    吸引广大群众参加监督国家工作人员的工作，使自下而上的批评检举和自上而下的检查督促结合起来，是监察机关能否完成任务的主要关键。“三反”运动以来的事实，充分说明了这一问题。因此，人民监察机关必须十分注意加强人民检举接待室、人民意见箱、人民询问处的工作，提高人民监察通讯员的工作，改善对一般人民来信的处理工作。对各机关进行这些工作的情形，也要随时检查推动，督促他们及时地正确地处理人民的控告和其他要求解决的问题。同时要利用各种机会，主动地访问群众，向群众宣传监察机关的性质与任务，号召群众大胆揭发任何国家工作人员的错误。只有做好这些工作，监察机关才能及时地发现各方面的问题；仅凭监察通讯员和监察机关干部是很难做到的。
    各级党政领导机关与领导干部，应该看到监察工作是帮助自己发现工作中、干部中所存在的问题和推动改进工作的；因此应该支持这一工作，支持监察机关向一切违法失职人员进行斗争，积极地建立与健全监察机构、培养与配备监察干部，并讨论、检查监察工作，给监察人员进行工作以各方面的方便。有些地区的党政领导机关对监察工作不讨论，不检查；有的已有条件建立监察机关而未建立；有的虽然建立了机关而无专职干部；有的虽然配备了干部，但不合条件的还不少。这些问题，各地领导机关应该有计划有步骤地帮助解决。
