Senior cadres of the Northeast Military Region, after completing their study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have now moved on to studying Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR."

More than 300 senior cadres and some regimental-level cadres participated in this study, organized into 28 study groups according to the military region-level organs and various military branches. The military region also established a central group, with Comrades Zhou Huan and Mo Wenhua serving as the group leader and deputy group leader respectively, and Tang Conglie, the director of the Propaganda Department, as the secretary.

During this study period, the study system was strictly implemented, and everyone was able to study on time and attend discussion meetings on time. Most comrades were able to prepare speeches in advance, and they also paid attention to linking their thoughts and practical work in their studies. Therefore, they have already achieved significant gains.

First, most comrades felt that the study was helpful to them and began to increase their interest and confidence in studying theory. Many leading comrades discovered many shortcomings in their work and leadership during the study, feeling that they could not do without studying. This also aroused the importance of political theory study among leading cadres, and they adhered to the study system. For example, the Logistics Department, Cadre Department, Political Department, and Heilongjiang Military Region were all units that adhered to the study system well.

Second, through study, not only did they gain a further understanding of the content of Soviet socialist economic construction, but also, in learning from the Soviet experience in construction, they began to use the advanced Soviet experience to guide the regularization and modernization of the troops, improve their work, and improve their leadership. Especially when studying parts two and three of Malenkov's report, all units launched work inspections and self-criticism in light of the spirit of the document, and exposed problems such as bureaucracy, violations of law and discipline, failure to accept criticism, and failure to pay attention to thrift, improve technology, and increase production in the troops. For example, the Logistics Department, Transportation Department, and Barracks Management Department, after combating bureaucracy and continuing to carry out the thrift campaign, expect to save 250 billion yuan within the system this year.

However, the development of this study is still uneven. Basically, there are still three situations: First, good units. These units conscientiously adhered to the study system and paid attention to combining theory with practice and combining theory with thought, and everyone's morale was very high. Second, some units, although they also adhered to the system and studied on time with a stiff upper lip, did not study carefully and did not find the right method, circling around terms. Third, units that did not study well only held one or two discussion meetings, neither studying on time nor digging into the material.

In view of the above situation, the Northeast Military Region decided: For units that have studied well, it is required to "consolidate achievements and persevere," and their experience will be promoted; for units that have not studied deeply and have not adhered to the system well, they will be urged and inspected on the one hand, and helped to improve their study methods on the other hand, so that cadres can gain something from their studies and arouse their interest.

The study method of the senior cadres of the Northeast Military Region is basically carried out according to the method of the Northeast Bureau under the leadership of Chairman Gao Gang, namely: First, the central group is combined with the general cadres. Each comrade participating in the central group is assigned two tasks: "Study well yourself" and "Teach others." Therefore, they usually lead the cadres of their units to study. Any problems that cannot be solved in the study are raised by them to the central group of the military region for discussion, and then relayed back to the original unit. (II) Study is closely integrated with work. The central group of the military region stipulates that study should be linked to thought and work, but the spirit of the document must be understood first. This is the case when studying Comrade Malenkov's report. After the study, it is stipulated that every cadre should write心得(心得，xīndé，what one has learned), so as to carry out a systematic review and criticism.

It has been proven from this study that there are two key points to whether the study of senior cadres can be sustained: namely, ensuring study time and leading cadres personally participating in and strictly controlling the study. If the main leaders do not study and only ask others to study, no matter how strictly you talk about it, they will not study well. Because Vice Political Commissar Zhou Huan and Political Department Director Mo Wenhua of the central group of the Northeast Military Region study on time every time and personally preside over the discussions, and often guide the work of the business departments, the central group has been relatively conscientious from the beginning to the present, and there are very few absences.

### 东北军区高级干部  学习斯大林著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”

    东北军区高级干部
    学习斯大林著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”
    东北军区的高级干部，在结束联共第十九次代表大会文件的学习以后，现已转入对斯大林著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”的学习。
    参加这次学习的高级干部及部分团级干部共三百余人，按军区一级机关及各兵种分别组织了二十八个学习小组。军区并成立了中心小组，由周桓、莫文骅二位同志分任正副组长，宣传部长汤从列为秘书。
    在这段学习中，执行学习制度较严格，大家都能做到按时学习，开讨论会时按时到会，大部分同志都能事先作发言准备，学习中也能注意联系思想、工作实际，因此已有显著的收获。
    首先，大部分同志经过这段学习，确实感到学习对自己有帮助，开始提高了对学习理论的兴趣和信心。许多领导同志在学习中发现了自己在工作上及领导上的许多缺点，感到不学不行，从而也引起了领导干部对政治理论学习的重视，并坚持了学习制度。如军区后勤部、干部部、政治部及黑龙江军区等单位都是坚持学习制度较好的。
    其次，经过学习，不但对于苏联社会主义经济建设的内容有了进一步的了解，而且在学习苏联建设事业的经验中，开始运用苏联的先进经验来指导部队正规化近代化的建设，改进了工作，提高了领导。特别在学习马林科夫报告第二、三部分时，所有单位都结合文件精神展开了工作检查与自我批评，对于部队中一些官僚主义、违法乱纪、不接受批评、以及不重视节约、提高技术和增加生产等方面的问题作了揭发。如后勤部、运输部、营管部等经过反官僚主义与继续开展节约运动，预计在制度内，今年可节约二千五百亿元。
    但这段学习的发展仍是不平衡的，基本上还存在着三种情况：一是好的单位。这些单位认真坚持了学习制度，并注意结合实际，结合思想进行学习，大家情绪很高。二是有些单位虽然也坚持了制度，按时硬着头皮进行学习，但学的不认真，不得法，在名词上打圈子。三是学得不好的单位，仅开过一、二次讨论会，既不按时学，也未钻进去。
    根据上述情况，东北军区决定：对学得好的单位，要求“巩固成绩、坚持下去”，并将他们的经验加以推广；对学得不深入和坚持制度不好的单位，一面加强督促检查，一面帮助他们改善学习方法，务使干部学有所得，以引起兴趣。
    东北军区高级干部的学习方法，基本上是根据高岗主席领导东北局学习的方法进行的，即：一、中心小组与一般干部相结合，参加中心组的同志，每人规定了两条任务：“自己学好”、“教给别人”。因此他们平时领导本单位干部学习，凡学习中有不能解决的问题，由他们提到军区中心小组进行讨论，解决后再回原单位进行传达。（二）学习和工作密切相结合。军区中心小组规定：学习要与思想、工作联系，但必须首先领会文件精神。如学习马林科夫同志报告时就是如此，学完后并规定每一个干部都写心得，通过写心得以进行一次有系统地检讨和批评。
    从这次学习证明：高级干部的学习能否坚持下去，主要有两个关键：即保证学习时间与领导干部亲自参加学习和严格掌握学习。如果主要首长不学，光叫别人学，再讲的严格也学不好。东北军区中心小组由于周桓副政委和政治部莫文骅主任每次都按时学习并亲自主持讨论，经常指导业务部门的工作，故中心小组从开始至今都比较认真，缺席的很少。
