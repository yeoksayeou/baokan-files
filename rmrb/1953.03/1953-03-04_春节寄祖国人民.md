Spring Festival Greetings to the People of the Motherland
Soldier of a Certain Unit of the Volunteer Army, Zhen Xin

The Spring Festival has arrived. This is the third Spring Festival spent fighting, another victorious Spring Festival. Our squad held a discussion. We ate candies, melon seeds, and peanuts sent by the people of the motherland across mountains and rivers, and drank old wine. Our joyful mood longed for the warm motherland and the future victory.

We talked with particular fervor about the factories, mines, rural areas, and schools of our motherland, and speculated about the new atmosphere that the Five-Year Plan would bring to the motherland.

We also thought that at this time the people of the motherland were also celebrating the Spring Festival as enthusiastically and happily as we were. The old grandfathers and grandmothers would rummage through the bottom of their boxes for new clothes that they usually couldn't bear to wear—perhaps these were distributed to them during the land reform, or perhaps they were left over from their wedding decades ago, but more were newly sewn recently, caressing their grandchildren’s apple-like little faces, listening to them sing, watching them dance and set off firecrackers. Parents were dressing their children in brand-new clothes, taking them to their maternal grandparents' house to pay New Year's greetings. Young people, especially children, were even more happy.

We all seemed to see pictures full of joy within the territory of the motherland.

Dear compatriots of the motherland, enjoy yourselves to the fullest! On the peaceful and happy land of the motherland, on the land of the motherland under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, enjoy yourselves to the fullest!

In Korea, we particularly understand the value of this kind of joy.

Not long ago, we transferred to a certain place in Korea. While still on the march, comrades were already reminiscing about the landlord family we had stayed with half a year ago. An old Korean woman, sixty-eight years old, and her fourteen-year-old granddaughter, Aigu. This was also a family that was once full of joy. The old woman had a strong son and a hardworking daughter-in-law. During the land reform, her family was allocated houses, land, a seven-acre apple orchard, and an ox. The daughter-in-law also went to work in a factory, and the granddaughter went to school. Life became happier year by year. However, American imperialism brought new disasters to them. In order to defend the motherland, Grandma Jin immediately sent her son to join the People's Army. When the People's Army temporarily retreated, Grandma Jin sent her daughter-in-law to join the guerrillas. American bandits broke into her hometown, destroyed her fields and gardens, and stole her old ox. Grandma Jin led her little granddaughter, leading the little ox, and spent a dark period in a cave. After the Korean and Chinese troops drove away the American bandits, our squad was stationed in her home for a period of time. The old woman treated us with the care and concern of a mother to her own sons. As soon as she saw that our clothes were dirty or torn, she would rush to wash and mend them. The clever little granddaughter, Aigu, was often with us, teaching us to speak Korean and learning Chinese from us. She sang "The East is Red" and "The Song of General Kim Il-sung". We got along as intimately as a family.

This time, when everyone heard that we were going back to the original garrison, they were extremely happy. We thought, how happy Grandma Jin would be to see us, and Aigu must have grown taller. We planned to tell them our victory news as soon as we met—our squad had defeated two battalions of American bandits in more than twenty assaults, killing and wounding more than three hundred enemies—to let Grandma Jin listen and vent her hatred, and let Aigu sing a few more songs for us.

“Aigu! Aigu!” While still at the door, comrades shouted. But we did not hear the cheerful response of that innocent little girl. Grandma Jin told us with tears in her eyes: Aigu was killed by American aerial bandits.

It was when the American aggressors were suffering a great defeat on the Shangganling front that the bandits took it out on the peaceful people in the rear of Korea. American planes frantically bombed and strafed peaceful Korean towns and villages. Jin Aigu, this fourteen-year-old girl, was feeding the cattle in the cowshed when she was deprived of her beautiful life by a burst of bullets from an American plane.

The wrinkles on Grandma Jin's face were even deeper. Although the Korean people, like the Chinese people, valued the Lunar New Year, it was difficult for Grandma Jin to restore her past joyful appearance. But she was not overwhelmed by grief. She stubbornly worked, and the flames of revenge burned.

The encounter of Grandma Jin's family is the encounter of countless families in Korea today. When we think of the people of the motherland celebrating the Spring Festival, Grandma Jin's hunched and kind back, and the beautiful and lovely smiling face of her little granddaughter, always flash before our eyes. These images constantly inspire us: to strike the American aggressors more severely, to avenge the old grandmothers and little girls of Korea! To protect the happy lives of countless old grandmothers and children in the motherland!

At this Spring Festival discussion, we discussed everyone's combat plan and resolved to implement Chairman Mao's instruction: "Fight until the US imperialists are willing to give up."

### 春节寄祖国人民

    春节寄祖国人民
    志愿军某部战士　振新
    春节来到了。这是第三个战斗的春节，又一个胜利的春节。我们班开了个座谈会。大家吃着祖国人民经过千山万水送来的糖果、瓜子、花生，还喝着老酒，大家欢乐的心情，都向往着温暖的祖国，向往着未来的胜利。
    我们分外火热地谈到我们祖国的工厂、矿山、农村和学校，猜测着五年建设计划将要带给祖国的新气象。
    我们也都想到：这个时候祖国的人民也和我们一样在热烈地、愉快地过春节了。老大爷、老婆婆们要从箱底里翻出平日舍不得穿的新衣——也许这是他们在土地改革时分到的，也许还是几十年前结婚时留下的，但更多的是最近才缝好的，抚摸着孙儿、孙女们苹果般的小脸，听他们唱歌，看他们跳舞和放花炮。父母们正在替孩子们打扮得一身簇新，挽着他们到外婆家去拜年。青年们，特别是孩子们，更是多末快活啊。
    我们都好像看见祖国境内这一幅一幅充满了欢乐的图画。
    亲爱的祖国同胞们，尽情地欢乐吧！在和平、幸福的祖国土地上，在毛主席、共产党领导下的祖国土地上，尽情地欢乐吧。
    在朝鲜，我们特别懂得这种欢乐的价值。
    不久以前，我们转到朝鲜某地。还在行军的路上，同志们就在怀念着半年以前我们驻地的那家房东。一位六十八岁的朝鲜老大娘和她的十四岁的小孙女爱姑。这也是一个曾经充满了欢乐的家庭。老大娘有一个健壮的儿子和勤劳的媳妇。土地改革中，她家分到了房子、田地，还分到了七分苹果园和一头牛，媳妇又进了工厂做工，孙女儿进了学校念书。日子一年比一年过得更幸福。但是，美帝国主义带给他们新的灾难。为了保卫祖国，金老大娘立刻送儿子参加了人民军。人民军暂时后撤时，老大娘又送儿媳妇参加了游击队。美国强盗闯进了她的家乡，破坏了她的田园，抢去了她的老黄牛。金老大娘就领着小孙女，牵着小黄牛，躲在山洞里度过了一段黑暗的岁月。朝中部队赶走了美国强盗以后，我们班曾在她家驻了一个时期。老大娘对我们像对亲生的儿子一样体贴和关心。一看见我们的衣服脏了、破了，马上就抢着拿去缝洗。聪明的小孙女爱姑时常和我们在一起，教我们说朝鲜话，也向我们学中国话。嘴里唱着“东方红”和“金日成将军之歌”。我们相处得像一家人那样亲热。
    这次，当大家听说要回到原驻地时，都高兴极了。我们想，金老大娘见了我们该多快乐，爱姑也一定长高了不少。我们盘算着一见面就把我们胜利消息告诉她们——我们一个班打垮了美国强盗两个营二十多次冲锋，杀死杀伤了三百多个敌人——让老大娘听了解解恨，让爱姑多给我们唱几只歌。
        “爱姑！爱姑！”还在门口，同志们就叫起来了。但是我们没有听到那个天真的小姑娘愉快的回答声。老大娘流着眼泪告诉我们：爱姑被美国空中强盗杀死了。
    那是在美国侵略者正在上甘岭前线大吃败仗的时候，强盗们就拿朝鲜后方的和平人民来泄忿，美国飞机疯狂地轰炸扫射朝鲜的和平城乡。金爱姑，这个十四岁的小姑娘，就是在牛棚里喂牛的时候，被美国飞机一梭子子弹夺去了她的美丽的生命的。
    金老大娘脸上的绉纹更深了。虽然朝鲜人民也和中国人民一样，重视过旧历年的，但金老大娘很难恢复她往日的欢乐容颜。但是她没有被悲恸所压倒。她倔强地劳动着，复仇的火焰燃烧着。
    金老大娘一家的遭遇，是今天朝鲜无数家庭的遭遇。当我们想到祖国人民欢度春节的时候，金老大娘龙锺慈祥的背影，她那小孙女美丽可爱的笑脸，总要幌到我们的眼前来。这些影像时时刻刻激励着我们：要更严重地打击美国侵略者，为朝鲜的老大娘和小女孩报仇！保卫祖国无数老大娘和孩子们的幸福生活！
    我们在这次春节的座谈会上，讨论了每个人的战斗计划，决心实现毛主席的指示：“一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止”。
