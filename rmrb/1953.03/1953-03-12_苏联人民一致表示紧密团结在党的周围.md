Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The live broadcast of the Stalin memorial service held in Moscow's Red Square on the 9th was transmitted via radio to all parts of the Soviet Union. Following the nationwide moment of silence at 12 o'clock, memorial services were held in factories, collective farms, government offices, and schools throughout the country. In recent days, in addition to deeply mourning, the working people have unanimously expressed their determination to transform grief into strength, closely unite around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, follow Stalin's teachings, and strive to build communism.

    In Moscow, workers at the Dinamo factory have exceeded their plans in recent days, manufacturing several hundred more sets of machines for the great Stalin Communist construction projects. Young assembly worker A. Povarov said: "We want to offer our labor achievements as wreaths dedicated to the memory of our beloved Stalin." Kudryavna, a female member of the Stalin Collective Farm near Moscow, said at the farm's memorial service: "Stalin's name will guide us from victory to victory. We will strive for even greater harvests, transform nature, and make life happier and more beautiful."

    From the morning of the 9th, the squares and streets of the heroic city of Leningrad were crowded with people. In Palace Square, Smolny, and near the Narva Triumphal Arch, hatless people silently listened to the speeches of Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov. Mikhailov, a worker at the Stalin Machine Factory, said at the memorial service: "We know that the cause to which Comrade Stalin devoted his life is now in the faithful and reliable hands of his students and comrades-in-arms. Our people clearly know this. All the employees of our factory pledge to complete the annual plan by December 21st and to manufacture the first hydraulic turbine for the world's largest hydroelectric power station – the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station – ahead of schedule in 1953."

    In Minsk, the capital of Belarus, hundreds of thousands of residents gathered in Stalin Square in front of the Stalin monument to listen to the live broadcast of the funeral from Red Square. After the moment of silence, memorial services were held throughout Belarus. Ba. Khersan, a foreman at the Stalin Machine-Building Factory in Bobruisk, said at the factory's memorial service: "We machine-building workers vow to complete every order for communist construction projects ahead of schedule." On the 9th, the people of Ukraine, together with all the Soviet people, bid a final farewell to the great Stalin. Shabelsky, a foreman at the Signal Apparatus Factory, said: "Our beloved Stalin is dead, but his cause lives on forever. His cause has been inherited by the reliable hands of his closest comrades-in-arms. The workers in our workshop have pledged to complete this month's plan before March 25th and to complete this year's plan before December 21st."

    In Yerevan, on the morning of the 9th, workers, staff, and students flocked to Victory Park, where the working people of Armenia had erected a monument to Stalin on the 30th anniversary of their republic. People continuously and respectfully offered flowers and wreaths in front of the monument, their eyes fixed on the image of the great leader. After listening to the live broadcast of the funeral from Moscow's Red Square, a solemn memorial service was held. The famous Armenian poet and Stalin Prize winner, Isahakyan, said at the Yerevan Writers' memorial meeting: "Stalin's banner is sacred to us. It is the banner of freedom, of the friendly cooperation of all nationalities, and the banner of world peace."

    From the 6th to the 9th, hundreds of thousands of people in Tashkent, day and night, streamed to the Stalin monument in the city center. The banner on the pedestal expressed what the Uzbek people felt in their hearts. They thanked Stalin, whose nationality policy enabled them to establish their own national state and helped them achieve unprecedented prosperity in their economy and culture.

    In Alma-Ata, twenty thousand residents gathered in front of the Stalin monument on the morning of the 9th to listen to the live broadcast of the funeral from Red Square. Kurochkin, a foreman at the Alma-Ata Machine-Building Factory, said that the factory workers guaranteed to complete the entire year's plan before December 5th, Stalin Constitution Day. Engineer Plotnikov said: "We vow to advance under the leadership of the Party along the path that the great Stalin pointed out to us." (Attached picture)

    苏联人民一致表示紧密团结在党的周围
    据新华社讯：九日莫斯科红场上举行斯大林追悼大会的实况，通过无线电传到苏联全国各地。在十二时全国默哀之后，各地企业、集体农庄、机关、学校纷纷举行追悼会。这几天，劳动人民除沉痛地哀悼外，一致表示化悲痛为力量，紧密地团结在苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府周围，遵循斯大林的遗训，努力建设共产主义。
    在莫斯科，狄纳莫工厂的工人近几天已超过计划为伟大的斯大林共产主义建筑工程多制造了几百套机器。青年装配工人阿·波瓦罗夫说：我们要把我们的劳动成就当作我们敬献的花圈，献到亲爱的斯大林的灵前。莫斯科近郊斯大林集体农庄的女庄员库德里亚夫娜在农庄的追悼会上说：斯大林的名字将引导我们从胜利走向胜利，我们将争取更大的丰收，改造自然，使生活更幸福更美丽。
    从九日早晨起，英雄城市列宁格勒的广场和街道上就挤满了人。在皇宫广场、斯莫尔尼和纳瓦门等处，脱了帽的人沉默地倾听马林科夫、贝利亚和莫洛托夫的讲话。斯大林机器工厂工人米哈伊洛夫在追悼会上说：我们知道，斯大林同志终生为之努力的事业已掌握在他的学生和战友们忠实而可靠的手中。我们人民明确地知道这一点。我们全厂职工保证在十二月二十一日完成全年计划，在一九五三年提前为世界上最大的水电站——古比雪夫水电站制造第一座水力透平。
    在白俄罗斯首都明斯克，十几万居民集合在斯大林广场的斯大林纪念碑前，收听红场葬仪实况。在默哀后，白俄罗斯各地都举行了追悼会。波布卢伊斯克的斯大林机器制造厂的领班巴·赫尔桑在该厂追悼会上说：我们机器制造工人宣誓要提前完成每一件共产主义建设工程的定货。九日那天，乌克兰的人民和全体苏联人民一起向伟大的斯大林作最后一次告别。信号器制造厂的领班沙别尔斯基说：我们敬爱的斯大林虽然死了，但是他的事业永远活着。他的事业已由他最亲密的战友的可靠的手继承过来了。我们车间的工人们已提出了保证，要在三月二十五日以前完成本月的计划，并且要在十二月二十一日以前完成今年
    一年的计划。
    在埃里温，九日早上，工人、职员、学生便纷纷到胜利公园去，亚美尼亚的劳动人民在自己共和国三十周年时曾在这里为斯大林建立了纪念碑。人们不断地把鲜花和花圈恭敬地献到碑前，眼光集中地凝视着伟大领袖的形象。在收听了莫斯科红场葬礼实况后，人们隆重地举行了追悼会。亚美尼亚著名诗人、斯大林奖金获得者伊萨克扬在埃里温作家追悼大会上说：斯大林的旗帜对我们是神圣的，这是自由的、亲切的各民族合作的旗帜，这是世界和平的旗帜。
    从六日到九日，塔什干成千成万的人民不分昼夜源源不断地走向市中心的斯大林纪念碑。碑台的横幅上写着乌兹别克人心里的话，他们感谢斯大林，斯大林的民族政策使他们建立了自己的民族国家，帮助他们使自己的经济和文化达到了空前的繁荣。
    在阿拉木图，两万居民在九日早上就集聚在斯大林纪念碑前，收听红场上的葬仪实况。阿拉木图机器制造厂的领班库罗契金说，该厂工人保证在斯大林宪法日十二月五号以前完成全年的计划。工程师普罗特尼科夫说：我们宣誓要在党的领导下沿着伟大斯大林指给我们的道路前进。（附图片）
