The Northwest Construction Engineering Company’s more than six thousand construction workers who underwent winter training have now returned to the construction sites. After two months of winter training, the workers' class consciousness has generally improved. Many workers have voluntarily examined their erroneous behaviors related to the employee mentality and not cherishing state property, and have voluntarily organized themselves to go back to past construction sites to pick up discarded nails, steel bars, scrap iron, and discarded ropes. Steelworker Zhuang Youren stated that he would guarantee to teach all his skills and experience to his apprentices without reservation. While learning advanced experiences, the workers broke with conservative thinking and expressed their willingness to seriously study advanced experiences. Many workers have automatically launched creative movements and have already created more than fifty kinds of relatively important tools.

Now, each winter training brigade has, in accordance with the principle of specialized division of labor, mixed high-skilled and low-skilled workers and apprentices into eighteen kinds of specialized production groups to implement a "special responsibility system" of specialized tools, specialized work, and specialized personnel. The compiled groups are fixed and become the basic-level labor organization of the construction site. At the same time, various responsibility systems have been established. This will change the past phenomena on construction sites of unclear responsibility and unclear division of labor, where no one was responsible.

    西北建筑工程公司冬训结束
    工人觉悟提高工作大有改进
    西北建筑工程公司经过冬季训练的六千多个建筑工人，现在已经重新进入工地。这批工人经过两月的冬季训练，阶级觉悟普遍提高。许多工人都自动检讨了雇佣观点和不爱惜国家财产的错误行为，并自动组织起来，跑到过去的工地，把随便丢掉的钉子、钢筋、废铁、废绳拾回来。钢筋工人庄友仁表示，保证把他所有的技术和经验，一点也不保留地教给徒弟。工人们在学习先进经验时，打破了保守思想，纷纷表示要认真学习先进经验，许多工人都自动展开创造运动，已经创造了五十多种较重要的工具。
    现在，各冬训大队已按照劳动分工专业化的方针，把技术高的和技术低的工人与学徒混编成十八种专业生产小组，实行专具、专活、专人的“专责制”，并把编成的小组固定下来，成为工地的基层劳动组织，同时建立了各种责任制。这样将改变过去工地上责任不明分工不清的无人负责的现象。
