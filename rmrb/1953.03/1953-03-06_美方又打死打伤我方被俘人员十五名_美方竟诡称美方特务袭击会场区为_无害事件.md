Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 5th. The U.S. side killed and wounded 15 of our captured personnel again. According to the U.S. side's announcement, on February 28th, the U.S. side killed one prisoner of war. On March 1st, another ten prisoners of war were killed and wounded. In order to shirk responsibility, the U.S. side described both of these incidents as "prisoners of war killing each other." But this kind of nonsense from the U.S. side can no longer deceive anyone. In our hands, we now have prisoners of war who were forced by the U.S. side to join the Syngman Rhee puppet army, and they have already exposed the U.S. side's crime of using Syngman Rhee gang special agents disguised as prisoners of war to abuse and persecute prisoners of war. According to the U.S. side's announcement, on March 1st, U.S. guards killed one prisoner of war on Geoje Island, simply because the prisoner of war reportedly "walked along the camp's fence." On March 2nd, one prisoner of war each was wounded on Geoje Island and Bongam Island. On March 3rd, another prisoner of war was killed on Yongcho Island. The recent series of massacres of prisoners of war in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps proves that the U.S. side's reign of terror against prisoners of war is becoming increasingly cruel in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 5th. U.S. liaison officer Carlog called the serious provocation of U.S. armed agents burning houses and wounding our military police in the conference area on the 4th a "harmless incident." Carlog, disregarding all the facts, insisted that the U.S. armed agents who caused these two incidents on February 10th and 12th were "unidentified persons," but at the same time, he defensively sophistry: "The fact that we are still meeting here after all these harmless incidents is sufficient proof that the negotiations have not been disrupted." This actually amounts to saying: the guns were fired, the fire was set, even so, there is no harm. People here believe that this indicates that the U.S. side will continue to instigate and condone armed agents to disrupt the security of the conference area on a larger scale. In fact, in the early morning of March 2nd, dozens of armed personnel under U.S. control once again used light machine guns and other weapons to fire at the conference area, and even fired at our security officers who were patrolling the conference area at the time of the incident. People here pointed out that this type of incident continuously created by the U.S. side is a serious threat to the barely maintained conference area agreement. At today's liaison officer meeting, Carlog had to admit: "It is true that the bullets and casings found are of the type used by the United Nations forces." But at the same time, he said that he did not know who fired these ammunition. In fact, these Rhee puppet armed agents sneaked into the conference area from near the U.S. tents in the conference area, and they left many clear footprints on the snow leading to the U.S. positions. When they fled, they shouted loudly: "We will turn Botshanli into a sea of fire." (Botshanli is a small village in the conference area, where the special agents set the fire).

Using the conference area for espionage activities has been a consistent trick of the U.S. side. As early as October 1951, a Korean child, Kim Won-gi, who was lured by the U.S. side to act as a special agent, publicly and in detail revealed the process of the U.S. side luring him to sneak into the neutral zone for espionage activities in front of liaison officers and reporters from both sides in Panmunjom. Last September, there was another despicable act by U.S. special agents sneaking into the conference area in an attempt to kidnap peaceful residents. These are just two examples of many similar incidents. Now, because the U.S. side is actively preparing to completely break the negotiations and launch a military adventure, this type of sabotage by special agents has become even more blatant.

    美方又打死打伤我方被俘人员十五名
    美方竟诡称美方特务袭击会场区为“无害事件”
    【新华社开城五日电】美方又打死打伤我方被俘人员十五名。据美方宣布，二月二十八日，美方打死战俘一名。三月一日，又有十名战俘被打死打伤。为了推卸责任，美方把这两次事件都说成是战俘们“自相残杀”。但是美方这种鬼话早就已经骗不了任何人。我方手中现在有着被美方强迫加入李承晚伪军的战俘，他们已经揭发了美方利用李承晚匪帮特务冒充战俘来虐待迫害战俘的罪行。另据美方宣布，三月一日，美国卫兵在巨济岛打死战俘一名，仅仅因为这个战俘据说“沿着营场的栅栏行走”。三月二日，在巨济岛、蜂岩岛各有战俘一名被打伤。三月三日，在龙草岛又有一名战俘被打死。美方战俘营中最近发生的一连串屠杀战俘事件，证明美方为了强迫扣留战俘，对战俘的恐怖统治是越来越残酷了。
    【新华社开城五日电】美方联络官卡洛克在四日把美方武装特务在会场区烧毁房屋和打伤我方军事警察的严重挑衅称为“无害事件”。卡洛克一方面不顾一切事实，硬说在二月十日及十二日制造这两次事件的美方武装特务是“不明身份的人”，但同时又心虚地诡辩道：“在所有这些无害事件之后，我们仍在这里开会，就足证并未破坏谈判。”这实际等于说：枪是打了，火是放了，即便如此，也无害处。此间人士认为，这表示美方将继续唆使及纵容武装特务来更大规模地破坏会场区的安全。事实上，就在三月二日的清晨，美方控制下的武装人员数十人，即曾又一次以轻机枪等武装对会场区射击，甚至对出事时在会场区巡视的我方安全军官也开枪射击。此间人士指出，美方连续制造的这类事件，对于勉强维持的会场区协议，是一个严重的威胁。在今天的联络官会议上，卡洛克不得不承认：“找到的子弹和弹壳是联合国军部队所用的类型，这是真的。”但同时他却说不知道发射这些弹药的是谁。事实上，这些李伪武装特务是从美方在会场区的帐篷近傍潜入会场区的，他们在雪地上留下了通向美军阵地的许多清晰足印。他们在逃走时还大声叫骂：“要把钵山里变成火海。”（钵山里是在会场区内的一个小村，是特务纵火的地方）。
    利用会场区进行特务活动，是美方一贯的伎俩，早在一九五一年十月，就有过一个被美方诱骗充当特务的朝鲜小孩金元基，在板门店当着双方联络官及记者多人，详细揭发了美方诱骗他潜入中立区进行特务活动的经过。去年九月，又发生过美方特务潜入会场区企图对和平居民进行绑票的卑鄙行为。这不过是许多同类事件中的两个例子而已。现在由于美方积极准备完全破裂谈判，发动军事冒险，这类的特务破坏活动也就更加明目张胆了。
