The people of Shaoshan Township in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province—Chairman Mao Zedong’s hometown—and the people of the old revolutionary base areas in Jiangxi Province, who are rich in glorious revolutionary traditions, were all deeply saddened upon learning of Stalin's death. On March 8th, the people of Shaoshan Township, Chairman Mao Zedong’s hometown; Nanchang, the city of the "August 1st" Uprising heroes; Ruijin County, the site of the Central Democratic Government during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War; Jinggangshan, the site of the meeting between Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De in 1928; and Yiyang County, the hometown of Chinese revolutionary martyr Fang Zhimin, sent telegrams to this newspaper and Xinhua News Agency to be forwarded to the people of Gori City, Tbilisi Oblast, Stalin's hometown in the Soviet Union, as well as Moscow, Stalingrad, and Stalin Oblast in Ukraine. They expressed their condolences for Comrade Stalin’s death and pledged to unite more closely, strengthen the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, learn from the Soviet Union, build the motherland, and resolutely fight to defend world peace. These telegrams are published below.

To the Comrades of Gori City, Tbilisi Oblast, Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic:

    With immense grief, we mourn the passing of Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world.

    The people of Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, Chairman Mao's hometown, will never forget the day last winter when Comrade Tikhonov, Comrade Stalin’s envoy—our dear friend—came from faraway Moscow to our Shaoshan Township. When he warmly said to all the people of Shaoshan Township, "Stalin—Moscow sends you greetings," our gratitude was indescribable. Because the Chinese people deeply know the selfless assistance and warm care that Comrade Stalin gave to our Chinese people and the enormous significance this had for our people's path toward a happy life. We will never forget Comrade Stalin's kindness to us.

    Shaoshan and Gori are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but our hearts are closely linked. In this sorrowful time, we vow to Comrade Stalin: let the brotherly friendship between Shaoshan and Gori continue for generations. Let the people of China and the Soviet Union unite even more closely to safeguard our peaceful and happy lives.

    Comrade Stalin will forever live in our hearts.
          The Entire People of Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, Chairman Mao’s Hometown
                                March 8, 1953

Respected Comrades and Friends of the Entire City of Moscow:

    We, the 200,000 people of Ruijin County, the red capital of China, feel immense sorrow upon hearing the devastating news of the passing of Marshal J.V. Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world and the most beloved teacher of the Chinese people, due to a serious illness. When the news reached factories, enterprises, schools, and government offices throughout the county, people immediately stopped working, lowered their heads in grief, and mourned in silence. The people of Ruijin County, who experienced the arduous times of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, deeply remember that as early as before 1931, when we were engaged in land revolution activities under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, during the difficult years when domestic enemies were launching successive frenzied attacks against us, Comrade Stalin was leading you in building socialism. At that time, Comrade Stalin repeatedly enlightened us, pointing out the path of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, encouraging our courage and confidence in the struggle, and finally achieving the victory of the national revolution. During the period of economic recovery and great construction in our motherland, Comrade Stalin and the Soviet people sent many outstanding experts to help us. Just as our country was beginning its first Five-Year Plan, our great teacher and friend Stalin unfortunately passed away. This is an immeasurable loss not only for the Soviet people but also a great loss for all the Chinese people. In these sorrowful days, we will never forget his deep friendship and selfless assistance. We are determined to transform our deep sorrow into strong strength. The people of the entire county will unite more closely around Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, study Stalin's theories and advanced Soviet experience to build our motherland.

    Dear Comrades, Friends: We firmly believe that the great friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, developed under the education of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong, will be further developed and consolidated, and we will advance hand in hand along the path indicated by Stalin.

    Stalin's glorious name will be immortal and will forever live in our hearts.

    We extend our deepest condolences.
              The Entire 200,000 People of Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, China
                                March 8, 1953

Respected Comrades and Friends of the Entire City of Stalingrad:

    Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, has unfortunately departed from us forever. This is an immeasurable and enormous loss to the common cause of progressive humanity worldwide. The people of our entire city extend our deepest and most heartfelt condolences! In this sorrowful time, we cannot help but recall that in the arduous struggle of the Chinese people's revolution over the past thirty years, Comrade Stalin gave us selfless assistance and support. In particular, the Chinese people, following the path pointed out by Comrade Stalin in 1926—that the Chinese revolution is an armed revolution against armed counter-revolution—under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, launched the glorious "August 1st" Uprising in Nanchang in 1927, established and developed the revolutionary armed forces of the Chinese people, and ensured the victory of the Chinese revolution. This is the brilliant result of the application of the great Stalin's theories in the practice of the Chinese people's revolution. Stalingrad, the heroic city of the Soviet Union, under the personal leadership and command of Comrade Stalin, achieved a great victory in defending Tsaritsyn during the Civil War. In the Patriotic War, it annihilated more than 300,000 Hitlerite bandits and became the turning point in the victory of the anti-fascist struggle. We fully believe that the people of heroic Stalingrad, like all the Soviet people, will in the future unite even more closely around the long-tested Party of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet government, and will use all their strength and creativity to play an even greater heroic role in the great communist construction of the Soviet Union.

    Dear Comrades, Friends! All progressive causes in the world are inseparable from the existence and development of the Soviet Union, and are inseparable from Comrade Stalin's genius theories and leadership. The Soviet path is our path. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. In the future, we, the people of Nanchang City, together with the people of the entire country, will resolutely follow the instructions of Chairman Mao Zedong, with the greatest firmness, and will always closely unite with the great and heroic Soviet people. In the great construction of our motherland, we will further promote the glorious revolutionary tradition of the "August 1st" Uprising, heighten our vigilance, strengthen the victorious struggle to resist America and aid Korea, step up production, learn from you, implement the first Five-Year Plan of the country, and develop the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples in all aspects, and make unremitting efforts to ensure peace in the Far East and the world.
                            The People of All Circles in Nanchang City, China
                                March 8, 1953

Respected Comrades, All Collective Farm Peasants of Stalin Oblast:

    When we learned of the unfortunate passing of Comrade J.V. Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world, our most beloved teacher and friend, all the peasants in our area were deeply saddened. Our Jinggang Mountains area is where Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, following the path pointed out by Stalin—that the Chinese revolution is an armed revolution against armed counter-revolution—began to establish the first armed revolutionary base area in China, laying the foundation for the victory of our national revolution. From our personal participation in the revolutionary struggle, we deeply know that the victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the selfless assistance and support of Stalin and all of you, the Soviet people. After the victory of the revolution in our motherland, when we began to carry out great construction, we received the enthusiastic help of Comrade Stalin and you. However, Stalin has now parted ways with us forever. This cannot but make us feel infinitely sorrowful and mournful. Dear Comrades! We deeply believe that the unbreakable, brotherly friendship between us will continue to develop and be consolidated. During the period of construction in our motherland, we will continue to learn from you, take you as an example, follow the path of agricultural collectivization pointed out by Comrade Stalin, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, advance victoriously together with you, and strive to fulfill Stalin's great ideals. We also believe that you will make unremitting efforts in the great construction of communism that is underway under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government.

    Long live the brilliant cause of the great Lenin and Stalin!

    Comrade Stalin will be immortal!

    With brotherly respect!
                    All the Peasants of the Jinggang Mountains Area, Jiangxi Province, China
                                March 8, 1953

Respected All the People of Stalin's Hometown:

    The news of the unfortunate passing of our most respected teacher, Comrade Stalin, has reached us here, and the people of the entire county are immersed in deep mourning. From now on, both you and we have lost a great and beloved leader and teacher.

    At this time of immense grief, as Comrade Stalin bids farewell to the world, we recall the difficult struggles against domestic enemies led by Comrade Fang Zhimin, an outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party, more than 20 years ago. At that time, we received sincere assistance from Comrade Stalin and you, which enabled us to survive the long and arduous years. Although Comrade Fang Zhimin gloriously sacrificed himself, thousands upon thousands of outstanding Chinese people followed in the footsteps of the martyrs and finally achieved the victory of the national revolution.

    Today, when the great construction of our motherland is beginning and you are building a communist society, Comrade Stalin has unfortunately passed away, which is an immeasurable loss. Dear Comrades: You are the people of the great Stalin's hometown. We believe that you will continue to unite around the Party of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet government, and strive for the communist construction that is underway.

    Dear Comrades! Our close friendship has developed in a common cause and struggle, and in the future, it will continue to develop and be consolidated. We, along with the people of the entire country, will continue to take you as an example and learn from you. We know that your today is our tomorrow. We will confidently continue to unite closely with you under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and strive to the end to realize our common cause.

    Long live the unbreakable, brotherly friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!

    We extend our deepest condolences and sincere condolences to you.
                      The Entire People of Yiyang County, Jiangxi Province, China
                                March 8, 1953

    中苏人民的革命友情继续到世世代代
    毛泽东主席的故乡——湖南省湘潭县韶山乡，和富有光荣革命传统的江西老根据地人民，在获知斯大林逝世噩耗后，莫不悲痛万分。三月八日，毛泽东主席故乡——韶山乡，“八一”起义英雄城——南昌，第二次国内革命战争时期中央民主政府所在地——瑞金县，一九二八年毛主席与朱总司令会见地——井冈山，中国革命烈士方志敏故乡——弋阳县等地人民，致电本报和新华社转达苏联斯大林主席的故乡——第比利斯州哥里城和莫斯科、斯大林格勒、乌克兰斯大林省等地人民，悼念斯大林同志逝世，表示要更亲密团结，加强中苏人民间牢不可破的友谊；学习苏联，建设祖国，坚决为保卫世界和平而奋斗。现在把这些电报发表如下。苏联格鲁吉亚苏维埃社会主义共和国第比利斯州哥里城的同志们：
    我们以万分悲痛的心情，哀悼世界劳动人民的伟大领袖——敬爱的斯大林同志的逝世。
    毛泽东故乡——中国湖南省湘潭县韶山乡人民，不会忘记斯大林同志的使者——我们亲爱的朋友吉洪诺夫去年冬天从遥远的莫斯科来到我们韶山乡的一天，当他向我们韶山乡全体人民热情地说“斯大林—莫斯科向你们问好”的时候，我们感激的心情是无法形容的。因为中国人民深切地知道：斯大林同志对我们中国人民无私的援助和亲切的关怀，对我们祖国人民走向幸福生活的巨大意义。斯大林同志对我们的恩情，我们永远也不会忘掉。
    韶山—哥里隔着千山万水，但是我们的心是紧紧地连结在一起。在这悲痛的日子里，我们向斯大林同志宣誓：让韶山和哥里兄弟般的友情继续到世世代代。中苏两国人民更紧密地团结在一起，保卫我们和平幸福的生活。
    斯大林同志永远活在我们的心里。
      毛泽东故乡湖南省湘潭县韶山乡全体人民
                                    一九五三年三月八日敬爱的莫斯科市全市同志们、朋友们：
    惊闻世界劳动人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最挚爱的导师约·维·斯大林大元帅因重病不幸逝世，我们中国红色故都——瑞金县二十万人民感到万分的悲痛。当噩耗传到全县各工厂、企业、学校和机关中，人们都立即暂时停止了工作，沉痛地低下头来，默默地哀悼。经历过中国革命斗争中艰苦时期的瑞金县人民，深深地记得，远在一九三一年以前，我们正在毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导下，进行土地革命活动时，国内敌人疯狂向我们进行连续进攻的艰苦年月里，当时正是斯大林同志领导着您们开始建设社会主义的时候，在这时候，斯大林同志就一再昭示了我们，指出中国革命斗争的途径，鼓舞了我们斗争的勇气和信心，终于取得了全国革命的胜利。在我们祖国经济恢复和大建设的时期，斯大林同志和苏联人民又派来了许多优秀的专家帮助我们。正在我们祖国开始第一个五年建设计划的时候，我们伟大的导师和朋友斯大林却不幸逝世了。这不但是苏联人民不可估量的损失，同样也是我们全中国人民的重大损失。在这悲痛的日子里，我们决不会忘怀他老人家深厚的友谊和无私的援助。我们决心把沉痛的哀悼化为坚强的力量，全县人民更紧密地团结在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的周围，学习斯大林的学说和苏联先进经验来建设我们的祖国。
    亲爱的同志们、朋友们：我们深信：在列宁、斯大林和毛泽东教养下发展起来的中苏两大民族的伟大友谊将得到进一步的发展和巩固，将携手并肩地沿着斯大林所指示的道路前进。
    斯大林的光辉名字将永垂不朽，它永远活在我们的心里。
    敬致最沉痛的悼念。
              中国江西省瑞金县全县二十万人民
                                    一九五三年三月八日亲爱的斯大林格勒全市同志们、朋友们：
    全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志，不幸和我们永别了。这是全世界进步人类共同事业中难以估量的巨大损失。我们全市人民致万分悲痛的、衷心的哀悼！在这个悲痛的日子里，我们不能不想起三十多年来在中国人民革命的艰苦斗争中，斯大林同志对我们无私的援助和支持，特别是中国人民遵循着斯大林同志在一九二六年所指出的中国革命是武装的革命反对武装的反革命的途径，在毛主席、中国共产党的领导下，于一九二七年在南昌举行了光荣的“八一”起义，建立并发展了中国人民的革命武装，保证了中国革命的胜利。这是伟大斯大林的学说在中国人民革命实践中的光辉成果。苏联的英雄城市——斯大林格勒，曾由斯大林同志的亲自领导和指挥，在国内战争中取得了保卫察里津的伟大胜利；在卫国战争中歼灭了三十多万希特勒匪军，成为反法西斯斗争胜利的转折点。我们完全相信，英雄的斯大林格勒的人民，和苏联全体人民一样，今后将更加紧密地团结在久经锻炼的列宁、斯大林党和苏维埃政府的周围，以你们的全部力量和创造力，在苏联伟大共产主义建设中发挥更大的英雄作用。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！世界上一切进步事业都是和苏联的存在与发展分不开的，是和斯大林同志天才的学说和领导分不开的。苏联的道路，就是我们的道路。苏联的今天，就是我们的明天。今后，我们南昌市人民和全国人民一道，坚决遵照着毛泽东主席的指示，以最大的坚定性，和伟大的、英雄的苏联人民永远紧密地团结一致。在我们祖国的伟大建设中，我们将进一步发挥“八一”起义的光荣革命传统，提高警惕，加强抗美援朝的胜利斗争，加紧生产，向您们学习，执行国家第一个五年建设计划，从各方面发展中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊，为确保远东和世界和平作不懈的斗争。
                            中国南昌市各界人民
                                一九五三年三月八日亲爱的斯大林省的全体集体农庄农民同志们：
    当我们得悉全世界劳动人民的领袖、我们最敬爱的导师和朋友约·维·斯大林同志的不幸逝世，我们全区农民都万分痛心。我们井冈山区是毛泽东主席和中国共产党遵循着斯大林所指出的：中国革命是武装的革命反对武装的反革命的道路，开始建立的中国第一个武装革命根据地，在这里奠定了我们全国革命胜利的基础。从我们亲身参加革命斗争中，我们深切地知道，中国革命的胜利是与斯大林和您们全苏联人民无私的援助和支持分不开的。在我们祖国革命胜利后，开始进行大建设的时候，我们又得到了斯大林同志和您们的热诚帮助。可是，斯大林却在这时与我们永别了。这不能不使我们感到无限的沉痛哀悼。亲爱的同志们！我们深切地相信我们之间牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊将继续发展和巩固，在我们祖国建设的时期，我们将继续向您们学习，以您们为榜样，遵循着斯大林同志所指出的农业集体化道路，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，和您们一道胜利前进，为完成斯大林的伟大理想而奋斗。我们也相信您们将在苏联共产党和苏维埃政府的领导下为正在进行的共产主义的伟大建设作不息的努力。
    伟大的列宁、斯大林的光辉事业万岁！
    斯大林同志永垂不朽！
    谨致兄弟般的敬礼！
                    中国江西省井冈山区全体农民
                                一九五三年三月八日敬爱的斯大林故乡的全体人民：
    我们最敬爱的导师斯大林同志不幸病逝的消息传到了我们这里后，全县人民都浸沉在沉痛的哀悼中。从此，您们和我们都失去了一位伟大的、敬爱的领袖和导师。
    在斯大林同志与世长辞，万分悲痛的时候，我们回顾二十多年前在中国共产党优秀党员方志敏烈士领导下向国内敌人作艰苦斗争的情形，那时我们从斯大林同志和您们那里得到了真诚的援助，使我们度过了漫长的艰苦岁月。虽然方志敏同志光荣牺牲了，但千千万万的优秀中国人民却踏着先烈们的血迹前进，终于取得了全国革命的胜利。
    今天，在我们祖国的大建设开始时和您们正在建设共产主义社会的时候，斯大林同志不幸逝世了，这是一个不可估量的损失。亲爱的同志们：您们是伟大的斯大林故乡的人民，我们相信您们将继续团结在列宁、斯大林党和苏维埃政府的周围，为正在进行的共产主义建设而奋斗。
    亲爱的同志们！我们亲密的友谊是在共同的事业和斗争中发展起来的，今后它将继续发展和巩固。我们和全国人民一起也将继续以您们为榜样，学习您们。我们知道，您们的今天，就是我们的明天。我们将满怀信心地在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，继续和您们亲密地团结在一起，为实现共同事业而奋斗到底。
    中苏两大国兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    敬向您们致以最沉痛的哀悼和亲切的慰问。
                      中国江西省弋阳县全体人民
                                一九五三年三月八日
