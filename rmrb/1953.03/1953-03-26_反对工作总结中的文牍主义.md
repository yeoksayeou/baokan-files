    Oppose Bureaucracy in Work Summaries
    Jin Wu
    Work summaries are for summarizing the problems and lessons learned from past work and for improving and enhancing future work methods. However, many units often adopt a serious bureaucratic approach when summarizing work. For example, the 1952 year-end summary report of the Hubei Tianmen Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company was ninety-three pages of six-opening paper, of which twenty-two pages (approximately 30,000 words) were text, sixty-nine pages were statistical tables, and two pages were the cover and back cover. However, this gigantic summary did not explain anything. The "Inspection of the Plan" section of the summary stated: "Cotton exceeded the target the most in November, accounting for 159.84 percent of the plan, and performed the worst in June, accounting for 45.46 percent of the plan; cotton yarn performed the best in December, accounting for 208.04 percent of the plan, and performed the worst in April, accounting for 59.25 percent of the plan; ... Yonglong completed the least cotton yarn, accounting for only 26.25 percent of the plan, while Yuekou performed better, completing 122.45 percent.” The degree of completion of the plan varied so greatly, indicating that there were many problems. However, the summary did not mention the reasons for completing or not completing the plan, that is, it did not grasp the essence of the problem, but instead mechanically applied a pile of "correct leadership of the Party and government," "bumper harvests," "completion of land reform," or "insect and flood disasters," "inventory backlog, slow-moving goods," and other clichéd terms. What can this explain? It should be said that this is a huge waste of manpower and resources. According to rough estimates, under normal circumstances, compiling such a large summary would require more than 2,400 workdays just for drafting the text (not including collecting materials) and creating tables, and the manpower used for copying and printing is not even included. Therefore, I suggest that when summarizing work, all departments must seriously and conscientiously solve some problems, and after analysis and criticism, summarize the experiences and lessons learned from the work, and propose effective ways to improve and enhance the work; in terms of text and tables, we should strive for clarity, conciseness, and the ability to explain the problems, and resolutely oppose bureaucracy.

    反对工作总结中的文牍主义
    靳吾
    工作总结是总结过去工作的问题和经验教训，改进和提高今后工作的方法。但许多单位在总结工作时，常常采用一种严重的文牍主义的方法。例如，湖北天门花纱布支公司一九五二年年终总结报告，就有九十三页六开纸，其中文字占二十二页（约三万字），统计表格占六十九页，还有两页是封面和封底。但这个巨型的总结并没有说明什么问题。总结中“计划的检查”一节写道：“棉花以十一月份超额完成最多，占计划百分之一五九·八四，以六月份完成最差，占计划百分之四五·四六；棉纱以十二月份完成最佳，占计划百分之二○八·○四，以四月份完成最差，占计划百分之五九·二五；……棉纱完成较少的，永隆占计划仅百分之二六·二五，岳口完成较佳，完成百分之一二二·四五”。完成计划的程度相差这样大，足见其中有许多问题。但总结中并没有提到完成与未完成计划的原因，即没有抓住问题的实质，而是硬套上一堆“党政正确领导”、“丰产”、“土地改革完成”或“虫灾水灾”、“仓储滞销、冷背货较多”等八股名词，这能说明什么呢？应该说，这是一种对于人力、物力的巨大浪费。据粗略统计，按照一般的情况，搞这么一个大总结，仅撰写文稿（不包括搜集材料）和制表，就要用二千四百多个工作日，缮印工作所用的人力尚未计算在内。因此，我建议各部门总结工作时，必须严肃认真地解决一些问题，经过分析、批判，把工作经验教训总结出来，并提出改进和提高工作的有效办法；在文字、表格上，应力求明确、扼要、能说明问题，坚决反对文牍主义。
