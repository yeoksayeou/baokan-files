    Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau No. 1 Engineering Company
    Actively Overcomes Difficulties to Compile Construction Organization Design
    The No. 1 Engineering Company of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau, in the absence of finalized technical designs, took the initiative to overcome difficulties and actively compile the construction organization design. It has now preliminarily completed the organizational design for site layout, positioning, organization management, and industrialized and mechanized construction. More than 50,000 cubic meters of materials have been transported to the site, and temporary construction projects have also been completed ahead of schedule.
    In the past, the company did not create a complete construction design before construction, which caused many difficulties. For example, last year, the No. 4 construction site did not design the construction process well. When plastering, the interior walls were plastered before the exterior walls. As a result, the weather was cold when it came to plastering the exterior walls, and the project had to be postponed to this year. Learning from past lessons, this year the company is determined to make overall considerations on construction sequence, construction methods, technical supply, site layout, and organizational management before construction begins, and to make a careful construction organizational design. However, since this is a new task, everyone's understanding is not consistent. Some technicians believe: "We have been working for so many years, and we have been constructing without any construction organization design. Why bother with these new tricks!" Some people imagined it to be too profound, thinking that the current conditions are not enough and it is difficult to achieve. Therefore, at the beginning of January this year, the company organized site cadres and technicians to study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in compiling construction organization designs, carried out ideological mobilization, and criticized various erroneous views. Then, several professional meetings were held to discuss the content of the construction organization design and summarize past lessons. After doing this, everyone's understanding was unified, and a preliminary plan for the construction organization design was formulated. A strong technical force was organized to conduct on-site production in a construction area.
    The technical design of the project in this construction area has not yet been completed, and the only basis is a project entrustment letter and a general layout plan of the preliminary design. There are many difficulties in carrying out the construction design. However, in order to explore experience and to comprehensively promote it before construction, the company decided not to wait for the technical design and to do as much as possible what can be done first.
    In terms of site layout, they first conducted a detailed re-measurement of the site to fully understand the above-ground obstacles and terrain conditions, and to supplement the omissions in the original general plan, so as not to affect the placement of materials and the deployment of temporary construction projects. Then, according to the general layout plan of the preliminary design and the construction requirements on the project entrustment letter, the location of material stacking, the location of temporary construction projects, the location of each processing plant, as well as water and electricity supply systems, light railways, and road systems, etc. were carefully arranged. In the process of site layout, they comprehensively considered the conditions for smooth construction and implemented the principle of economic accounting. For example, temporary construction projects took into account several multi-year projects, prepared cold-proof facilities, and used the most economical materials such as sorghum stalks and rice straw; transportation roads made as much use as possible of the permanent lines of formal projects, and tried to shorten the transportation distance; the location of material stacking took into account the order of opening, the order of material use, the direction of transportation, and the nature, consumption, etc. of the materials; the location of warehouses and processing plants took into account the terrain, topography, supply objects, and the distance of dedicated lines. Temporary construction projects mainly considered the degree of project concentration, sanitary and fire protection conditions, and the distance of the work area. In short, everything strives to achieve the most economical use of manpower and materials and to make construction as convenient as possible. According to preliminary calculations, the temporary road system alone saves more than 1,600 people and more than 200 cubic meters of cinder compared with the original plan, worth more than 30 million yuan.
    In terms of organizational management, it was determined that the construction site should be the basic construction organization and cost accounting unit, and a one-leader system headed by the site director should be established. In order to adapt to complex construction requirements and strengthen planning management, a unified dispatching agency was established to grasp the construction situation of each construction site and uniformly dispatch manpower and material resources, so as to rationally utilize resources and promptly discover and solve problems in construction. In order to strengthen the connection between Party A and Party B, a democratic management committee was established to resolve relevant matters between the two parties and conduct unified quality inspection. In order to strengthen measurement work, a measurement office was established separately; in order to strengthen inspection work, an inspection station was established separately.
    In terms of construction methods, since the projects in the construction area are relatively concentrated, concrete, steel bars, formwork, doors and windows, and other projects are all manufactured in a factory-like manner, and processing plants are established for centralized manufacturing. It is also planned to establish sewer pipe, particleboard factory, and mortar mixing station. In terms of mechanized construction, it mainly involves concrete mixing and vertical transportation by winches. In addition, machinery should also be used for hoisting, digging, stone washing, stone rolling, and steel bar cutting.
    In completing this work, the company paid attention to criticizing the mentality of dependence and waiting, and the personnel participating in the work gave full play to their high degree of initiative and creativity. Without benches, they worked on the table to make plans, and without beds, they slept on the floor. The comrades of the measurement team also created a method of determining points by measuring intersecting angles, which increased the efficiency of measurement positioning by more than one time. In addition, they also developed the use of colored cloths and colored flags to mark the stacking positions of different materials, so that after the materials are transported to the site, they can be correctly stacked in the planned positions. Now the company has carried out a preliminary summary and is studying and improving the shortcomings in the work, and is carrying out the next step of construction organization design work in a tense manner.

    东北有色金属管理局第一工程公司
    主动克服困难编制施工组织设计
    东北有色金属管理局第一工程公司在技术设计尚未作出的情况下，主动克服困难，积极编制施工组织设计，现已初步完成了场地布置、定位、组织管理，以及工厂化、机械化施工等组织设计。五万多立方公尺的材料已运进现场，暂设工程也提前竣工了。
    过去，该公司在施工前没有做出较完整的施工设计，曾给施工造成很多困难。如第四工地去年没有很好设计施工程序，抹灰时先抹内墙后抹外墙，结果到抹外墙时天气已冷，工程只得拖到今年。接受过去的教训，今年该公司决心在开工前对施工顺序、施工方法、技术供应、场地布置、组织管理等问题作通盘考虑，作出周密的施工组织设计。但是，由于这是一项新工作，大家的认识还不一致。有的技术人员认为：“干了多少年，没有什么施工组织设计，也一样施工，何必来这些新花样！”有的人又把它设想得过分深奥，认为目前条件不够，很难做到。因此，该公司就于今年一月初组织工地干部和技术人员学习苏联编制施工组织设计的先进经验，进行思想动员，批判了各种错误看法。接着又召开了几次专业会议，讨论了施工组织设计的内容和总结了过去的教训。这样做了之后，大家的认识统一了，随即制订了施工组织设计初步方案，并组织了较强的技术力量，到一个建筑地区去实地制作。
    这个建筑地区的工程还没有作出技术设计，可作为根据的只有一份工程委托书和一张初步设计的总平面图，进行施工设计有很多困难。但是，为了摸索经验，以便在开工前全面推广，该公司决定了不等待技术设计，尽可能先做可能进行的工作。
    在场地布置上，他们首先对场地进行了详细的复测，以求充分了解地上障碍物和地形情况，补充原来总平面图所遗漏的部分，以免影响材料堆置和暂设工程的部署。然后根据初步设计的总平面图和工程委托书上的建筑要求，缜密地布置了材料堆积位置、暂设工程位置、各加工厂位置，以及水、电供应系统、轻便铁道和道路系统等等。在做场地布置的过程中，他们全面地考虑了顺利施工的条件和贯彻了经济核算的原则。如暂设工程考虑了若干跨年度工程，准备了防寒设施，并采用了秫秸、稻草等最经济的材料；运输道路尽可能地利用了正式工程的永久性线路，尽量使运输距离缩短；材料堆积位置考虑了开工程序的先后、材料使用的次序、输送方向和材料的性质、耗损情况等；仓库和加工厂的位置考虑了地形、地势和供应对象、专用线的距离。暂设工程则主要考虑工程集中程度、卫生和防火条件，以及工作地区距离等。总之，一切力求达到最经济地使用人力、物力和使施工尽量方便的目的。据初步计算，仅临时道路系统一项，就较原计划节省了一千六百多人和二百多立方公尺煤碴，价值三千多万元。
    在组织管理上，确定以工地为施工基层组织及成本核算单位，建立以工地主任为首的一长制。为了适应复杂的施工要求和加强计划管理，成立了统一的调度机构，掌握每个工地的施工情况和统一调度人力、物力，以合理利用资源，及时发现与解决施工中的问题。为了加强甲、乙双方联系，成立了民主管理委员会，以解决有关双方事宜及统一进行质量检查。为了加强测量工作，单独成立了测量处；为了加强检查工作，单独成立了检查站。
    施工方法方面，由于该建筑地区工程比较集中，所以混凝土、钢筋、模板、门窗等工程，均采取工厂化生产方式，成立加工厂集中制造。并拟成立下水道管、刨花板工厂和灰浆搅拌站等。在机械化施工方面，主要为混凝土搅拌及卷扬机垂直运输，此外起重、挖土、洗石、轧石、钢筋切断等工作也要使用机械。
    该公司在完成这项工作中，注意批判了依赖等待思想，参加工作的人员都发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。没凳子就伏在棹子上做计划，没有床就睡在地板上。测量组的同志并创造了测相交角定点的方法，使测量定位效率提高一倍以上。另外还研究出用色布和色旗标志不同材料的堆放位置，使材料运进现场以后，能正确地堆放在计划的位置上。现在该公司已进行了初步总结，正在研究改进工作中的缺点，紧张地进行下一步的施工组织设计工作。
