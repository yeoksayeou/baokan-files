Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 26th: The "Pravda" published an article by its London correspondent, V. Mayevsky, about the struggle of the British working people for peace, according to TASS, Moscow, March 25th.

Mayevsky wrote: For more than three months, about 350 report meetings by representatives attending the World People's Peace Congress have been held in various parts of the United Kingdom. Despite the slanders of reactionary newspapers and the persecution of active peace fighters by the reactionaries, the historical documents of the World People's Peace Congress have been enthusiastically received by the British people. Not only among the working people, but also among people of other strata, the protest movement against the policy of expanding armaments is becoming stronger and stronger. Well-known social and political leaders throughout the country have called for a revision of the British government's policy on the German question. The policy of continuing the Korean War is causing increasingly violent protests among broad sections of the British people. In order to expose this policy, the British Peace Committee printed tens of thousands of leaflets entitled "Prevent War with China," which were distributed throughout the country and received widespread support.

A major event in the struggle for peace was the recent British National Women's Conference. The conference was attended by more than 2,200 representatives from all over the country, demonstrating the growing strength of the British women's movement. The conference unanimously passed a resolution calling for an immediate end to the Korean War.

The women who attended the conference firmly stated upon their return that they would unremittingly fight for peace and the future of their children.

The peace organizations of scientists, writers, teachers, and veterans are constantly increasing their influence and prestige in the United Kingdom.

Mayevsky continued: Preparations are currently underway throughout the country for the National Peace Action Congress. This congress will be held in Manchester on May 17th, and preparatory meetings will be held in London, Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Scotland. Local peace organizations are strengthening their activities. There are now 360 local peace committees in the United Kingdom, which is a great improvement compared to not long ago. Non-party people, Labour Party members, Communist Party members, trade union members, and cooperative members work side by side in these committees and have achieved great success.

Mayevsky concluded: The peace movement in the United Kingdom is now entering a new stage. All attempts to slander this movement will only serve to isolate those who engage in such slander. The idea of struggling for peace has been grasped by millions of British people.

    英国人民抗议战争政策的运动蓬勃展开
    【新华社二十六日讯】　据塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：“真理报”刊载了该报驻伦敦记者维·马耶夫斯基写的一篇关于英国劳动人民争取和平斗争的文章。
    马耶夫斯基写道：三个多月以来，英国各地大约举办了三百五十次出席世界人民和平大会的代表的报告会。尽管反动报纸进行了诽谤，尽管反动派对积极的和平战士进行了种种迫害，但是世界人民和平大会的历史性的文件已获得英国人民的热烈响应。不仅在劳动人民中间，而且也在其他阶层人民中间，反对扩充军备政策的抗议运动越来越强烈了。全国知名的社会领袖和政治领袖们纷纷要求修改英国政府对德国问题的政策。继续朝鲜战争的政策正引起英国广大阶层的人民日益剧烈的抗议。英国和平委员会为了揭露这种政策，印发了几万份题为“防止与中国作战”的传单，在全国各地散发，获得了普遍的支持。
    在争取和平斗争中的一个重大事件是最近举行的英国全国妇女大会。这次会议有两千二百多位来自全国各地的代表参加，显示了英国妇女运动日益增长的力量。这次会议一致通过了一项决议，要求立即停止朝鲜战争。
    参加会议的妇女们回去的时候，都坚决表示，要为和平和她们的孩子们的前途不懈地奋斗。
    科学家、作家、教师和退伍军人的和平组织在英国的影响和威望正在不断地提高。
    马耶夫斯基继续写道：目前全国各地已经开始为全国和平行动大会进行筹备工作。这个大会将于五月十七日在曼彻斯特举行，并将在伦敦、兰开夏、约克郡和苏格兰等地举行预备会议。各地的地方和平组织正在加强活动。现在英国共有三百六十个地方和平委员会，这种情况与不久以前比较起来是一个极大的进步。无党无派人士、工党党员、共产党党员、工会会员和合作社的社员们在这些委员会中携手并肩地工作，获得很大成就。
    马耶夫斯基最后写道：现在英国的和平运动正在进入一个新的阶段。一切企图造谣中伤这个运动的行为都适足以使这种造谣中伤的人们陷于孤立。争取和平的斗争思想已经掌握了千千万万的英国人民。
