Upholding and Implementing the Marriage Law
Li Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

In 1950, the Central People's Government promulgated the historically significant Marriage Law, opening up a broad and happy road to happiness, harmony, unity, and freedom for the family life of the Chinese people. This is a great joyous event for the people of the whole country. The Marriage Law stipulates the abolition of feudal systems of forced, mercenary, and arranged marriages and the preference for sons over daughters, and the establishment of a new system and new morality of equality between men and women, freedom of marriage, monogamy, and protection of the legitimate rights and interests of women and children. The implementation of this decree will play a significant role in promoting social progress, enhancing people's unity, and promoting industrial and agricultural production and large-scale national construction. At the same time, in order to align the interests of social progress with the interests of national defense, Article 19 of the Marriage Law stipulates: "If the spouse of a revolutionary serviceman in active service who has communication with his family proposes a divorce, the consent of the revolutionary serviceman must be obtained." This further demonstrates concrete concern for revolutionary servicemen and their families and reflects the complete rationality of state laws.

The instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on implementing the Marriage Law, issued on February 2nd of this year, also pointed out: "In the movement to implement the Marriage Law, it is necessary to conduct in-depth education on cherishing revolutionary servicemen and their families, to earnestly help military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers to solve difficulties, establish households, and raise the political status of military families; and to conduct patriotic education on the glory of military families, praising exemplary deeds of military families in supporting the front, harmonizing families, and engaging in labor production. When handling marriage cases of revolutionary servicemen, it is necessary to strictly follow the provisions of Article 19 of the Marriage Law and other relevant laws and decrees on handling marriage issues of revolutionary servicemen. For marriage incidents that do not comply with the above regulations, patient persuasion and education should be carried out to make them consciously abide by government laws and decrees. Do not affect the care for revolutionary servicemen under the pretext of unilaterally protecting the interests of women. For marriage incidents that comply with the above regulations, legal procedures should be strictly followed." The supplementary instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the work of the Marriage Law Movement Month, issued on February 18th of this year, further clearly pointed out that in propaganda, "call on cadres and the people to respect active revolutionary servicemen and retired disabled revolutionary soldiers, protect their marriages and families, and oppose anyone undermining them." These wise regulations, when transmitted to the troops, will surely arouse great excitement and encouragement, thereby further arousing combat spirit and enhancing the close unity between the army and the people; for the people, this will further enhance patriotic enthusiasm, resulting in many patriotic model families and model couples.

The tremendous efforts made by the people of the whole country in the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers have also created favorable conditions for the implementation of state laws. In 1951, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government allocated 800,000 jin of millet to help military families with production; the Huaiyin Special Administrative Office in northern Jiangsu allocated 2.7 billion yuan to build houses for military families; Shenyang, Hankou, Chongqing and other cities successively established military family factories; in Beijing and various cities and villages, "Families of Glory" plaques were hung at the doors of military families; throughout the rural areas, priority was given to cultivating land for military families, and many exemplary villages for giving preferential treatment, such as Lujiazhuang Village in Boxing County, Shandong, Beizhaobazhuang Village in Shenze County, Hebei, and Yaoshanggou Village in Wuxiang County, Shanxi, emerged. After the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the continuous movement to give preferential treatment to military families, the work of giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers has been strengthened everywhere. As a result, the political status of military families has been further improved and their lives are more secure. Consequently, revolutionary servicemen at the front and their family members in the rear have gained unlimited spiritual comfort and encouragement. This has helped to maintain deep emotional ties between couples at the front and in the rear. We revolutionary servicemen should sincerely support the Marriage Law and model its implementation in the movement to implement the Marriage Law.

In the past thirty years, millions of outstanding Chinese daughters have, along with male comrades, participated in the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Third Revolutionary Civil War, and up to today's War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Our female comrades have not only displayed unlimited revolutionary enthusiasm and perseverance, doing many things for the people, but they have also shared the joys and sorrows with male comrades, going through thick and thin together, sharing common goals and feelings in their joint work and struggle, and many have formed revolutionary couples. This kind of free and independent spouse based on class friendship is extremely compatible with the revolutionary cause and personal happiness. They have also given birth to many children. These children are very smart and lively, and some have entered schools or nurseries, or are still held in their mothers' arms. It should be said that the marriages in our People's Army have always implemented the New Democratic marriage system. In the future, we should further deepen and develop various harmonious marital relationships and become models for implementing the Marriage Law. However, there are also a few comrades who have had estrangement and disharmony due to non-principled details. It is hoped that they should take into account the revolutionary feelings in adversity and the revolutionary offspring, and return to good terms with a sincere spirit of self-criticism. Everyone should strive for continuous progress in thought and work. In particular, some of our female comrades often find it difficult to keep pace with male comrades due to physiological reasons and childbearing, and have some distressed emotions, and even show helpless and passive psychology towards continuing to progress, which is not appropriate. In fact, there are many female comrades who have not been hindered by marriage; at the same time, raising children is the responsibility of mothers. If children are helped to raise, they should work harder and study hard to improve themselves in all aspects. In the future, national defense construction, economic construction, and cultural construction urgently need a large number of cadres, and today we should seize the time to work hard to study a profession, so that every comrade can have a skill to make practical contributions to the great national construction cause. Couples should also encourage each other and make progress together!

Many comrades in our troops are married or engaged at home. Today, during this temporary separation, how can we make both sides more emotionally close, united, respectful, loving, and encouraging? Those exemplary revolutionary couples have given us good answers. Since the birth of New China, there have been many exciting examples. This also demonstrates the heroic spirit and excellent qualities of our Chinese sons and daughters. For example, Volunteer soldier Han Jianghe and his wife Xu Lamei are examples of a new type of couple. Before Han Jianghe joined the army, they produced together in a mutual aid group, moving forward hand in hand, respecting and loving each other; after joining the army, both launched revolutionary competitions for killing enemies and producing. The woman assumed the production responsibility of the whole family, and the man devoted himself to killing enemies. Just one year after the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, Comrade Han Jianghe became a combat hero, and Comrade Xu Lamei was elected as a labor model in Wuxiang County, Shanxi. Another example is Gao Guizhen from Shunyi County, Hebei, and Ding Baolan, the lover of Ren Zhongchang from Lijiatun, Heilongjiang Province, both of whom are fiancées of Volunteer soldiers. Their love for the motherland, their love for the people, and their love for their loved ones encouraged them to break through feudal restraints and voluntarily go to their fiancés' homes to help with housework and cultivate the land. They have become models praised by the people of the whole country. Such infinitely moving deeds have inspired countless soldiers to improve their combat spirit, and it is conceivable how much power they will have in promoting close emotional ties between the front and the rear. We hope that such role models will continue to emerge in tens of thousands to show the brilliant achievements of implementing the Marriage Law.

In order to continue to promote the deeds of these exemplary revolutionary couples, to promote the new marital morality and excellent qualities they have shown, to inspire combat at the front and promote social progress, we believe that the main focus is on the following two aspects:

First, we request the comrades of the local committees of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and mass organizations, especially the village cadres, to educate military families with the most sincere and warm attitude, to infinitely improve their patriotic enthusiasm and ideological level, to improve their enthusiasm for production, to adopt many excellent experiences in preferential treatment work, and to do their best to help and encourage them to achieve good production results and learning results, thereby further improving their social status and political sense of honor, so that they receive genuine respect and preferential treatment, and at the same time pay attention to spreading their achievements and honors to the local area and to the troops, so that they actively contact the front-line fighters, and powerfully inspire front-line combat.

Second, we request the political organs of the front-line troops to further mobilize commanders and fighters to write encouraging letters home, to regularly inform their families of their progress, achievements, and meritorious honors, and to encourage mutual competition. The Volunteer Army has generally done a good job in this work since going abroad. In addition to communication, most cadres and soldiers have been mobilized to save their allowances and remit money home to encourage production. The political organs constantly send comrades' meritorious service reports and other honorary certificates to the government of their families' residence. In this way, the temporarily separated couples and families at the front and in the rear are closely linked emotionally, politically, and in the cause of struggle. The political organs and commanders and fighters of the troops should further fully recognize the necessity of this kind of communication and mutual encouragement, and hope to do these tasks better in the process of implementing the Marriage Law throughout the country.

The marriage issues of comrades in the troops should and can only be handled in accordance with the principle of subordinating to the interests of war and national defense. This supreme and greatest interest of subordinating individual interests to the whole is the supreme virtue of revolutionaries and patriots, and should be sincerely respected and cherished by the people.

In the Volunteer Army, there are not only many comrades who are already married or engaged, who are resolutely standing on the front line of the anti-aggression war, temporarily separated from their relatives, in order to defend their beloved motherland, defend the fruits of the people's revolution, defend the great national construction, and defend peace in the East and the world; and there are more unmarried comrades, who, for the same solemn mission, recognize the current situation of the great enemy, victory first, and therefore put their personal marriage issues behind them, concentrate all their efforts, and bravely kill the enemy and make meritorious contributions. This is extremely admirable. Their achievements in defending the motherland and world peace, and their spirit of patriotism, internationalism, and people's heroism, will be eternally remembered by the people of the whole country. It can be believed that as long as the war is won, these personal issues will definitely be resolved satisfactorily.

    拥护贯彻婚姻法
    中国人民志愿军政治部秘书长　李贞
    一九五○年中央人民政府颁布了具有历史意义的婚姻法，为中国人民群众的家庭生活，开辟了幸福、和睦、团结、自由的康庄大道。这是全国人民的一件大喜事。婚姻法规定了此后废除强迫、买卖、包办婚姻和重男轻女的封建制度，建立男女平等、婚姻自由、一夫一妻、保护妇女和子女合法权利的新制度和新道德。这一法令的贯彻，对于推动社会进步，增强人民团结，促进工农业生产和国家的大规模建设，将有很大作用。同时，为了使社会进步的利益与国防利益趋于一致，在婚姻法第十九条里又规定：“现役革命军人与家庭有通讯关系的，其配偶提出离婚，须得革命军人的同意。”这更表现了对于革命军人及其家属的具体关怀，反映了国家法令的完全合理性。
    今年二月二日，中央人民政府政务院关于贯彻婚姻法的指示中又指出：“在贯彻婚姻法运动中，要深入进行爱护革命军人及其家属的教育，切实帮助军属与革命残废军人、复员军人解决困难，建立家务，提高军属政治地位；并对军属进行军属光荣的爱国主义教育，表扬军属支援前线、和睦家庭、劳动生产等模范事迹。处理革命军人的婚姻案件时，必须遵照婚姻法第十九条的规定及其他有关处理革命军人婚姻问题的法令认真办理。对于不合上述规定的婚姻事件应耐心进行说服教育、使之自觉遵守政府法令。不得藉口片面的保护妇女利益而影响对革命军人的照顾。对于符合上述规定的婚姻事件，应严格遵照法定的手续办理。”今年二月十八日中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示，更明确指出，在宣传中“号召干部和人民群众敬爱现役革命军人和退役革命残废军人，保护他们的婚姻和家庭，反对任何人加以破坏。”这些英明的规定传到部队，必将引起极大的兴奋和鼓舞，从而进一步激起战斗精神，并增强军民的亲密团结；对于人民群众，这也将进一步提高爱国热情，从而出现许许多多的爱国的模范家庭和模范夫妇。
    全国人民在拥军优属工作中所尽的巨大努力，也为国家法令的贯彻创造了有利的条件。一九五一年天津市人民政府拨了八十万斤小米，帮助军属生产；苏北淮阴专署拨了二十七亿元，给军属修房子；沈阳、汉口、重庆等市，先后成立了军属工厂；北京和各个城市与乡村中，家家军属门口挂上了“光荣人家”的牌匾；各地农村中到处优先代耕军属土地，并出现了像山东博兴县卢家庄、河北深泽县北赵八庄、山西武乡县窑上沟村等许多优抚模范村。全国经过抗美援朝爱国运动和连续的优待军属运动，各地的优属工作都在加强。这样，军属的政治地位更加提高，生活更有保障。因而前方的革命军人与后方的军人家属互相获得了精神上无限的安慰与鼓舞。这就帮助了前后方夫妻之间保持着深厚的感情联系。我们革命军人，应当热诚地拥护婚姻法，并在贯彻婚姻法运动过程中模范地执行它。
    近三十年来，千百万的中国优秀女儿与男同志们一道，参加了第一次和第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争、直至今天抗美援朝的战争。我们的女同志一面发挥了无限的革命热情与毅力，为人民做了许多事情；另方面她们与男同志同甘苦、共患难，在并肩工作与战斗中，志同道合，情意相投，许多已结成了革命夫妻。这种基于阶级友爱的自由自主的配偶，对革命事业、对个人幸福，都是极相融合的。他们也生育了许多儿女。这些孩子们很聪明、很活泼，有的已进学校或保育院、托儿所，或者尚抱在母亲的怀里。应当说，我们人民军队中的婚姻历来是实行新民主主义婚姻制度的。今后我们更应该把各个和睦的夫妻关系进一步深厚地发展起来，成为贯彻婚姻法的模范。但也有少数同志，曾因非原则的细节问题，而发生过隔膜不睦。希望他们应当顾念着患难中的革命感情、革命后代，以诚恳的自我批评精神，言归于好。大家都应该力求在思想上、工作上不断进步。尤其是我们若干女同志，常因生理与生育孩子的关系，难于同男同志一路齐头并进，而存在了某些苦恼的情绪，甚至对于继续进步表示无可奈何的消极心理，这是不应当的。实际上有许许多多的女同志，她们并没有因为结婚而妨碍了工作；同时养育儿女是母亲的责任。如果儿女有人帮助抚养，自己就更应努力工作，努力学习，从各方面提高自己。今后国家国防建设、经济建设、文化建设迫切需要大批的干部，今天我们更应抓紧时间努力钻研一门业务，求得每一个同志都能有一技之长，以便在伟大的国家建设事业中作出切实的贡献。夫妻之间也应该互相勉励，共同进步！
    我们部队中有许多同志，是在家里已经结了婚的，或是已经订了婚的。今天在暂时别离的期间内，应该如何使得双方在情感上更加亲密团结、互敬互爱、互相鼓励呢？那些模范的革命夫妻们给了我们很好的答案。新中国诞生以来，这种令人兴奋的范例是很多的。这也正表现了我们中华儿女的英雄气概和优秀品质。如志愿军战士韩江河及其妻徐腊梅，是一对新型夫妻的范例。韩江河同志参军前，他们在一个互助组里生产，携手前进，互敬互爱；参军后，双方发动了杀敌、生产的革命竞赛。女的担负了全家的生产责任，男的一心一意去杀敌。抗美援朝刚一年，韩江河同志成了战斗英雄，徐腊梅同志被选为山西武乡县的劳动模范。又如河北顺义县的高桂珍、黑龙江省李家屯任忠昌的爱人丁宝兰，她们都是志愿军战士的未婚妻。她们热爱祖国、热爱人民、热爱自己爱人的心，鼓舞着她们打破了封建束缚，自动去未婚夫家里帮助料理家务、代耕田地。她们已成为全国人民所称赞的楷模。这样一些无限动人的事迹，不知激励了多少的战士们提高了他们的战斗精神，也可以想像，对于密切前后方的感情联系会有多大的力量。我们希望这样的楷模继续成千成万地涌现出来，以表示贯彻婚姻法的辉煌的成就。
    为了继续发扬这种模范的革命夫妻的事迹，发扬他们和她们所昭示的新的婚姻道德和优良品质，以鼓舞前方作战和推动社会进步，我们觉得主要的是从以下两方面着手：
    第一、要求中国共产党地方党委和人民政府、群众团体的工作同志，特别是村干部，应以最恳切、最温暖的态度教育军属，无限提高她们的爱国热情和思想水平，提高她们的生产积极性，采用许多优良的优属工作经验，尽力帮助与鼓励她们获得很好的生产成绩和学习成绩，从而进一步提高她们的社会地位和政治荣誉感，使她们受到切实的尊重和优待，同时注意把她们的成就和荣誉传播到地方也传播到部队，使她们主动与前线战士联系，有力地鼓舞前线作战。
    第二、要求前方部队政治机关，进一步发动指战员同志给家里写鼓励信，以自己获得的进步、成绩和立功荣誉经常通知家里，鼓励互相比赛。志愿军出国以来对这一工作一般的做的不错。除通信联系外，还发动了大部分干部和战士，节余自己的津贴费，汇款回家，鼓励生产。各政治机关则不断地将同志们的立功喜报及其他荣誉证明书等，寄给他本人家庭所在地的政府。这样，就使暂时离别的前后方夫妻之间、家属之间，在感情上、政治上和斗争事业上紧密地联系起来。部队的政治机关和指战员同志，应该进一步充分认识这种通信联系和互相鼓舞的必要性，在全国贯彻婚姻法过程中，希望能把这些工作做的更好。
    部队同志的婚姻问题，在处理上是应该而且只能以服从战争利益与国防利益为原则的。这种以个人利益服从整体的最高最大的利益，是革命者与爱国者的无尚美德，应该受到人们衷心的尊崇和珍爱。
    志愿军部队中不仅有许多已经结婚、订婚的同志，他们为了保卫可爱的祖国，保卫人民革命胜利果实，保卫伟大的国家建设，保卫东方与世界和平，毅然决然立在反侵略战争的前线，与自己的亲属暂时分开；而且有更多的未婚同志，他们为了同一庄严的使命，认清大敌当前，胜利第一，因而将个人的婚姻问题放在脑后，集中全力，抖擞精神，去英勇杀敌立功。这是十分令人钦敬的。他们保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的功绩，他们的爱国主义、国际主义和人民英雄主义精神，将为全国人民永记不忘。可以相信，只要战争胜利了，他们的这些个人问题，是一定可以得到圆满解决的。
