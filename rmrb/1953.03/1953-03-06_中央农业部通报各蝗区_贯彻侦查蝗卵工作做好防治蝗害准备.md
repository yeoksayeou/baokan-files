Xinhua News Agency:
The Central Ministry of Agriculture issued a circular on February 26, requiring all locust areas (Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hebei, Henan, Xinjiang and other provinces where locusts occurred last year) to implement locust egg survey work and make timely preparations for locust plague prevention and control.

The circular first pointed out that most locust areas carried out locust egg survey work last winter and achieved certain results. According to incomplete statistics from five counties and cities including Xuzhou City in Jiangsu Province, more than 92,000 mu of land with locust eggs have been found; according to incomplete statistics from 24 counties and cities including Zhanhua and Kenli in Shandong Province, more than 1,466,000 mu of land with locust eggs have been found. The locust egg density found in these counties and cities is generally 10 to 25 egg masses per square shi zhang, with a maximum of 100 to 500 egg masses, and individual areas reaching 800 egg masses, a quite serious situation. However, due to the adjustment of administrative divisions in the original Pingyuan Province locust area, locust egg survey work was not carried out at all; some locust areas in Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces were flooded by rain, and therefore failed to survey locust eggs; locust egg survey work in Hebei Province and other locust areas was also not widespread and in-depth enough.

Based on the preliminary experience gained, the circular stated: It is necessary to educate cadres and farmers to recognize the long-term and continuous nature of locust egg survey work, and to have dedicated personnel responsible for this work.

The circular requires that all locust areas that have not conducted locust egg surveys or whose locust egg surveys are not widespread and in-depth enough must seize the time to conduct supplementary surveys after the thaw this spring. On the basis of locust egg surveys, all locust areas must make preparations such as establishing locust plague prevention and control stations, training personnel, and allocating medicines and equipment before the locusts occur.

    中央农业部通报各蝗区
    贯彻侦查蝗卵工作做好防治蝗害准备
    中央人民政府农业部在二月二十六日发出通报，要求各蝗区（山东、安徽、江苏、河北、河南、新疆等省去年发生蝗虫的地区）贯彻侦查蝗卵工作，并及时做好防治蝗害的各项准备工作。
    通报首先指出：各蝗区在去年冬季大多开展了侦查蝗卵工作，获得一定的成绩。据江苏省徐州市等五个县、市不完全统计，已查出有蝗卵的土地面积九万二千多亩；山东省沾化、垦利等二十四个县、市不完全统计，已查出有蝗卵的土地面积一百四十六万六千多亩。这些县、市查出的蝗卵密度，每平方市丈一般有卵十块到二十五块，最多有卵一百块到五百块，个别地区达到八百块，情况相当严重。但是，原平原省蝗区各专区、县由于调整行政区划，侦查蝗卵工作根本没有进行；安徽、江苏等省部分蝗区曾被雨水淹没，因而未能侦查蝗卵；河北省等蝗区查卵工作也不够普遍深入。
    根据已经取得的初步经验，通报中提出：必须教育干部、农民从思想上认识侦查蝗卵工作的长期性和连续性，并由专人负责这一工作。
    通报要求：凡未进行查蝗卵或查蝗卵不够普遍深入的蝗区，必须在今年春天解冻后抓紧时间补查。各蝗区在查蝗卵的基础上，要在蝗虫发生前做好建立蝗虫防治站、训练人员和调配药械等准备工作。
