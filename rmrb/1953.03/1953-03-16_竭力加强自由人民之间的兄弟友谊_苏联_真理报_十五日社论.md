    Striving to Strengthen the Brotherly Friendship Between Free Peoples
    --Soviet "Pravda" Editorial, March 15th
    The days of deep sorrow when the Soviet people and all progressive humanity bid farewell to their beloved teacher and leader, Comrade Stalin, became days of even closer unity of free people around the Soviet Union, around the Communist and Workers' Parties loyal to the cause of Lenin and Stalin. In these difficult days, hundreds of millions of people in various countries deeply recognized the infinitely great role and worldwide significance of Comrade Stalin's activities for the Soviet people, for the people of the people's democratic countries, and for the working people of the world. The cause of Lenin, the cause of Stalin, is immortal. It lives in the treasure house of Lenin and Stalin's thought, illuminating the path to a bright future for all mankind. It lives in the magnificent cause of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, leading the Soviet people to the brilliant heights of communism. It lives in the ever-growing power of the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism.
    As a result of the Second World War, China and the European people's democratic countries broke away from the capitalist system and, together with the Soviet Union, established a unified and powerful democratic and socialist camp that opposed the imperialist camp. The formation of the democratic and socialist camp is the greatest achievement of the people of all countries. In the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, built under the leadership of Comrade Stalin and comprising one-third of the world's population, the great Chinese people, the fraternal people of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Albania, the German Democratic Republic, and the Mongolian People's Republic, are advancing together with the Soviet people in close brotherly unity. The heroic Korean people are defending the independence of their motherland in a tenacious struggle. The people of all ethnic groups in Vietnam are fighting heroically for freedom and national independence. Between the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union, solid relations of friendship and unity have been established and are constantly being strengthened, which is the most important guarantee for the invincibility of the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism. This is an international relationship that is new in principle and has never existed in human history, based on the principles of proletarian internationalism of Lenin and Stalin, the principles of equality, economic cooperation, and respect for national independence. Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union, loyal to Lenin and Stalin's policy of friendship among all ethnic groups, has given, is giving, and will continue to give fraternal assistance and support to those who have freed themselves from imperialist oppression and embarked on the road of building a free and happy new life, helping them in their political, economic, and cultural construction, and helping them defend their freedom and the independence of their people's democratic countries. The economic cooperation of the free people of the democratic camp is remarkably fruitful, and Comrade Stalin, in his classic work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," described the great significance of this remarkably fruitful cooperation in this way: "This cooperation is based on mutual assistance and a sincere desire to achieve a common economic upsurge." With the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, the free people of the democratic camp have completed and are completing great revolutionary transformations in their own countries. This brotherly friendship of free people opens up endless sources of strength and indestructible power for the socialist camp, which has never existed and cannot exist under capitalism.
    In his historic speech at the 19th Party Congress, the great Stalin called Czechoslovakia one of the new "shock brigades" of the world revolutionary workers' movement. Czechoslovakia, like other countries in Central and Southeastern Europe, gained freedom because of the Soviet Union's victory over Hitlerite tyranny. The people of Czechoslovakia gained true freedom and true independence for the first time. After gaining freedom, the people of all ethnic groups in Czechoslovakia made their own choice: resolutely embarked on the road of socialism and confidently advanced under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, headed by Klement Gottwald, the beloved leader of the people of all ethnic groups in Czechoslovakia. The enemies of socialist construction, both domestic and foreign, have tried every means to destroy socialist construction and carry out various sabotage, conspiracies, and provocations. However, the working people of Czechoslovakia, under the leadership of Klement Gottwald, a loyal comrade-in-arms of the great Stalin, shattered their poisonous schemes and crushed their actions. In the struggle against the enemy, the people of all ethnic groups in Czechoslovakia have become more closely united around the Communist Party, and have constantly achieved new achievements in socialist construction, tirelessly strengthening their friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    Telegrams from Prague brought the sad news that the President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, outstanding activist of the international workers' movement, beloved leader of the Czechoslovak people, and loyal friend of the Soviet Union, Comrade Klement Gottwald, passed away on March 14 after a short and serious illness. Klement Gottwald, the great founder of People's Democratic Czechoslovakia, called on the Czechoslovak people during his lifetime to strengthen their friendship with the Soviet Union, "Forever with the Soviet Union!" Gottwald's words became the patriotic and fighting slogan of all the Czechoslovak people. Just a few days ago, Klement Gottwald, a loyal friend of the Soviet Union, at the memorial meeting, was still calling on the Czechoslovak people to resolutely follow Stalin's socialist road, consolidate the people's democratic state, unite more closely around the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and tirelessly strengthen friendship with the Soviet Union; and today, the Soviet people and all progressive humanity are lowering their flags before his coffin.
    Today, Comrade Klement Gottwald, a loyal comrade-in-arms of Comrade Stalin, is no longer alive. The Soviet people and the Czechoslovak people together feel deep sorrow for this heavy loss. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union said today in a telegram to the Central Committee of Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, and the National Assembly: "In these days of sorrow caused by this heavy loss, we express our firm belief that the Czechoslovak people will surely unite their ranks more closely around the Communist Party and Government of Czechoslovakia, and struggle for the cause of peace, for strengthening the friendship of all ethnic groups, and for building socialism. When the Soviet people share the sorrow of this heavy loss with the Czechoslovak people, they cherish the brilliant image of Klement Gottwald in their hearts. He will forever be an inspiring example of fighting for world peace and for the eternal friendship between the Soviet Union and the Czechoslovak Republic."
    More than thirty-five years ago, when our Communist Party raised the banner of the socialist revolution, the Soviet state born out of the October Revolution was still a lonely country surrounded by capitalist countries. Now, the situation is completely different. Now, from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, new "shock brigades" of the world revolutionary workers' movement have emerged, and the cause of socialism has been consolidated as never before. The unified and powerful socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is constantly growing and strengthening, and is moving from victory to victory in peaceful construction activities. Free people vigilantly guard their great achievements and defend the cause of peace. The Soviet people, closely united around the Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and the Soviet government, will continue to fight tenaciously and unswervingly to maintain and consolidate peace and oppose the imperialist warmongers. Loyal to the banner of proletarian internationalism, the great banner of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people will tirelessly strengthen the brotherly alliance and friendship with the great People's Republic of China, all people's democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic, and will carry out extensive economic and cultural cooperation with them. It is the sacred responsibility of all free people to defend and strengthen the greatest achievement of the people of the world - the camp of peace, democracy and socialism, to strengthen friendship and unity, and to strengthen the eternal and unbreakable brotherly friendship in the struggle against war and in defense of peace, and in the struggle for the bright future of the people of the world.

    竭力加强自由人民之间的兄弟友谊
    ——苏联“真理报”十五日社论
    苏联人民和全体进步人类跟自己亲爱的导师和领袖斯大林同志告别的深切沉痛的日子，成了自由人民更加紧密地团结在苏联周围，团结在忠于列宁、斯大林事业的共产党和工人党周围的日子。在这些困难的日子里，各国数以千百万计的人深刻地认识到：斯大林同志的活动对于苏联人民，对于人民民主国家的人民，对于全世界的劳动人民具有无限伟大的作用和全世界的意义。列宁的事业，斯大林的事业是不朽的。它活在给全人类照亮走向光明未来的道路的列宁、斯大林思想的宝库中。它活在领导苏联人民走向共产主义之光辉高峰的苏联共产党的宏伟事业中。它活在和平、民主和社会主义力量的日益增长的威力中。
    由于第二次世界大战的结果，中国和欧洲人民民主国家脱离了资本主义体系，和苏联一起建立了跟帝国主义阵营对立的、统一的、强大的民主和社会主义阵营。民主和社会主义阵营的形成是各国人民最伟大的成果。在斯大林同志领导下建立起来的、占全人类三分之一人口的和平、民主和社会主义阵营里，伟大的中国人民，捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、德意志民主共和国、蒙古人民共和国的兄弟人民，和苏联人民一起，在紧密的兄弟团结中向前迈进。英勇的朝鲜人民在顽强的斗争中捍卫着自己祖国的独立。越南各族人民为自由和民族独立而英勇地战斗着。在人民民主国家和苏联之间，建立了并且不断加强着坚固的友好团结的关系，这种关系是使和平、民主和社会主义事业不可战胜的最重要的保证。这是一种在原则上崭新的国际关系，是人类从来没有过的，它的基础是列宁、斯大林的无产阶级国际主义原则，是平等、经济合作和尊重民族独立的原则。从战争结束以来，苏联忠于列宁和斯大林的各族人民友好的政策，过去、现在和将来都对那些已摆脱帝国主义压迫而走上了建设自由幸福新生活的道路的人民，给以兄弟援助和支持，帮助他们进行政权、经济和文化建设，帮助他们保卫自由和人民民主国家的独立。民主阵营的自由人民的经济合作是卓著成果的，斯大林同志在他的经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”里曾对这种卓著成果的合作的伟大意义作了这样的描述：“这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”在苏联的兄弟帮助下，民主阵营的自由人民在他们自己的国家里完成了和正在完成着伟大的革命改造。自由人民的这种兄弟友谊为社会主义阵营的力量和不可摧毁的威力开辟了无穷无尽的源泉，这种源泉在资本主义的条件下是从来没有过的，而且也不可能有的。
    伟大的斯大林在第十九次党代表大会上发表的具有历史意义的演说里把捷克斯洛伐克叫做世界革命工人运动的新的“突击队”之一。捷克斯洛伐克和中欧及东南欧的其他国家一样，由于苏联战胜了希特勒暴政而获得了自由。捷克斯洛伐克的人民第一次获得了真正的自由和真正的独立。捷克斯洛伐克各族人民在获得了自由以后，作出了自己的抉择：坚决地走上了社会主义的道路，并在以捷克斯洛伐克各族人民亲爱的领袖克利门特·哥特瓦尔德为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下满怀信心地前进。捷克斯洛伐克国内外的敌人千方百计地企图摧毁社会主义建设，进行各种破坏、阴谋和挑衅活动。但是，在伟大的斯大林的忠诚战友克利门特·哥特瓦尔德领导下的捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民打破了他们的毒计，粉碎了他们的行动。在和敌人作斗争中，捷克斯洛伐克各族人民更紧密地团结在共产党的周围，并不断地在社会主义建设中获得新的成就，不倦地加强着跟苏联及人民民主国家的友谊。
    电报从布拉格带来了令人悲痛的消息：捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统、捷克斯洛伐克共产党主席、国际工人运动的卓越活动家、捷克斯洛伐克人民亲爱的领袖、苏联忠诚的朋友克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志，在患了短时间的重病后，已于三月十四日逝世了。人民民主捷克斯洛伐克的伟大缔造者克利门特·哥特瓦尔德生前号召捷克斯洛伐克的人民加强对苏联的友谊，“永远跟苏联在一起！”哥特瓦尔德的这句话成了全体捷克斯洛伐克人民的爱国的战斗口号。就在几天以前，苏联忠诚的朋友克利门特·哥特瓦尔德在追悼会上还在号召捷克斯洛伐克人民坚决地沿着斯大林的社会主义道路走去，巩固人民民主国家，更紧密地团结在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的周围，并且不倦地加强和苏联的友谊；而今天，苏联人民和一切进步人类都在他的灵柩前下降自己的旗帜。
    今天，斯大林同志的忠诚战友克利门特·哥特瓦尔德已经不在人世了，苏联人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民一起，对这个沉重的损失感到深切的悲痛。苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团今天在给捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会、捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和国民议会的唁电中说：“在由于这种沉重的损失而感到悲痛的日子里，我们表示坚决的信心，相信捷克斯洛伐克人民一定会更紧密地把自己的队伍团结在捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府的周围，为和平事业、为加强各族人民的友谊，为建设社会主义而斗争。苏联人民在和捷克斯洛伐克人民一同对这种沉重的损失感到悲痛的时候，心里怀念着克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的光辉的形象，他将永远是一个为世界和平、为苏联和捷克斯洛伐克共和国的永恒友谊而奋斗的令人鼓舞的榜样。”
    在三十五年多以前，当我国共产党举起社会主义革命的旗帜的时候，由十月革命所诞生的苏维埃国家还是一个受资本主义国家包围的孤独的国家。现在，情形完全不同了。现在，从中国和朝鲜直到捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利，已经出现了世界革命工人运动的新“突击队”，社会主义事业已经空前巩固。以苏联为首的、统一的、强大的社会主义阵营在不断地壮大着，巩固着，在和平的建设性活动中从胜利走向胜利。自由的人民警惕地守卫着自己伟大的成果，捍卫着和平事业。紧密地团结在共产党、共产党中央委员会和苏维埃政府周围的苏联人民，今后仍将顽强地、始终不渝地为维护和巩固和平、反对帝国主义战争贩子而斗争。忠于无产阶级国际主义旗帜、伟大的列宁—斯大林旗帜的苏联人民，将不倦地加强和伟大的中华人民共和国、一切人民民主国家、德意志民主共和国的兄弟联盟和友谊，并和它们进行广泛的经济和文化的合作。一切自由人民的神圣责任是：保卫并加强世界人民最伟大的成果——和平、民主和社会主义阵营，加强友谊和团结，加强在反对战争、保卫和平的斗争中、在争取世界人民光明将来的斗争中的永恒的牢不可破的兄弟友谊。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科十五日电）
