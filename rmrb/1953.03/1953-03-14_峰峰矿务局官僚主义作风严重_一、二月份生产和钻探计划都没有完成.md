    Fengfeng Mining Bureau's Serious Bureaucratic Work Style
    Production and Drilling Plans Not Completed in January and February

    Editor's Note: This稿子 (gao zi - manuscript, piece) was sent by the Fengfeng Workers' Newspaper. The Fengfeng Mining Bureau failed to complete the state plan for two months, and there are many problems; however, when the Fengfeng Workers' Newspaper wrote this 稿子 (gao zi - manuscript, piece) to criticize it, the mine leaders did not allow it to be published. We believe that the attitude of the Fengfeng Mining District Party Committee and the Mining Bureau is wrong. They should seriously examine the reasons for not completing the plan and actively try to improve.

    [Our Newspaper] The state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine only completed 97.36% of its planned coal production in January; the overall efficiency only completed 93.92% of the plan. The exploration drilling team only completed slightly more than 63% of its plan. The average daily output of the entire mine in January decreased by 346 tons compared to December of last year. February was even worse than January, only completing 82.36% of the state plan; overall efficiency only completed 74.5% of the plan.

    The bureaucratic work style of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau's leadership is an important reason for the failure to complete the production plan. The leadership of the Mining Bureau is completely ignorant of the production situation. They don't know how much property or how many people the entire mine has; the factory directors and mine managers don't know how many important machines or how many personnel their factory or mine has; the team leaders also don't know how many workers or how many tools their team has. The statistics from the bureau to the mine to the sections are all different, so they can only grab a handful at random when working.

    The conservative thinking among the employees is also very serious. The mines are leaving coal cutting machines unused, believing that coal cutting machines are not as easy to use as hand picks; they are not actively repairing coal cutting machines when they break down. Yuan Fushun, the engineering section chief of the geological department, does not believe in the Soviet "mud drilling method" and even told workers to mix in some yellow water to deal with the superiors. He ordered the workers to use clean water to fill the drill holes, resulting in the pipe getting stuck in the drill hole, wasting a lot of work hours before it was taken out.

    The phenomenon of commandism and irresponsibility in the mines is also very serious. On January 24, the Fourth Mine had three serious injury accidents in one day, but the mine manager did not even know how many people were injured, and the production office did not know either. The 204 tunneling face and 205 working face of the Second Mine often do not have wood, and cannot support the canopies according to the safety regulations, and no one is responsible for solving these problems. Liu Chungeng, the director of the geological survey department, does not understand technology, but he made his own set of "drilling operation regulations," neither asking for instructions from superiors nor soliciting opinions from workers, and ordered the workers to execute them. Wang Xuewen, the deputy captain of the drilling engineering team, "criticizes" workers whenever he speaks and threatens to send them to court, forbidding workers from having accidents. When a production team had an accident, before the responsibility was clarified, Wang Xuewen replaced the team leader and told the team leader to "reflect for three months." As a result of adopting this crude and coercive method, accidents not only did not decrease, but increased. In January alone, the six drilling engineering teams had fourteen accidents.

    This serious situation has not yet attracted the attention of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau and the Mining District Party Committee. If this situation cannot be changed quickly, there is a risk that the entire year's task will be unsuccessful. (Hong Guanglie)

    峰峰矿务局官僚主义作风严重
    一、二月份生产和钻探计划都没有完成
    编者按：这篇稿子是峰峰工人报社寄来的。峰峰矿务局两个月没有完成国家计划，存在的问题很多；但是，当峰峰工人报写了这篇稿子提出批评时，该矿领导方面却不准许发表。我们认为峰峰矿区党委和矿务局这种态度是错误的。他们应该认真检讨没有完成计划的原因，积极设法改进。
    【本报讯】国营峰峰煤矿一月份只完成计划产煤量百分之九十七·三六；全员效率只完成计划百分之九十三·九二。探钻工程队只完成计划百分之六十三强。一月份全矿每日平均产量比去年十二月份降低了三百四十六吨。二月份比一月份更差，只完成国家计划百分之八十二·三六；全员效率只完成计划百分之七十四·五。
    峰峰矿务局领导方面的官僚主义作风，是影响生产计划不能完成的重要原因。矿务局领导方面对生产情况是心中无数的。他们不知道全矿有多少财产、多少人；厂长、矿长不知道本厂、矿有多少重要机器、多少人员；掌子长照样也不知道本掌子有多少工人、多少工具。从局到矿到科各方面的统计数字都不一样，工作时只好乱抓一把。
    职工中的保守思想也很严重。各矿放着割煤机不用，认为割煤机不如手镐好使；割煤机坏了也不积极修理。地质处工程股长袁福顺不相信苏联的“泥浆钻岩法”，竟叫工人混点黄水应付上级。他命令工人用清水灌钻眼，结果把管子卡在钻眼里，浪费了很多工时才弄出来。
    各矿的命令主义、无人负责的现象也很严重。一月二十四日四矿一天出了三次重伤事故，矿长竟不知道伤了几个人，生产办公室也不知道。二矿二零四掘进工作面和二零五掌子面，经常没有木头，不能按保安规程的规定来支棚子，也没有人负责解决这些问题。地质勘测处处长柳春耕不懂技术，却自己作了一套“探钻操作规程”，既不请示上级，又不征求工人意见，就命令工人执行。探钻工程队副队长王学文，对工人开口“批评”，闭口送法院，威胁工人不许出事故。有个生产班出了事故，责任还没有弄清楚，王学文就撤换了班长，还叫班长“反省三个月”。采用这种粗暴的强迫命令办法的结果，事故不但没有减少，反而增多了。仅一月份，六个探钻工程分队就出了十四次事故。
    这种严重情况至今还没有引起峰峰矿务局和矿区党委的注意，这种情况，如果不能迅速改变，全年任务都有落空的危险。　（洪光烈）
