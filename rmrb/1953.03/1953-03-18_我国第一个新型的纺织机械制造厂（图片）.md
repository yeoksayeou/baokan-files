China's First New-Type Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant
　　The machinery and equipment in this textile machinery manufacturing plant are all highly modernized. When completed and put into production in the future, modern machinery and equipment can reduce or replace the physical labor of workers. This is an installed spindle lathe, and workers are test-driving it. This lathe is fully automated, and the operating workers only need to press the button and add raw materials, without any other physical labor.
　　Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant is China's newly built first new-type huge textile machinery manufacturing plant. For more than two years, with the efforts of all employees and the help of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, magnificent factory buildings and towering chimneys have appeared on the wasteland of Jinzhong Plain. The construction of this factory will be fully completed within this year. This is the scene of the row car workers in the tool machine workshop test-driving the Soviet-made milling machine.
　　For the heating needs of the workshop, the factory built huge gas equipment. This is a giant gas tank under construction.
　　Workers in the heavy-duty machine workshop are installing a four-axis gantry milling machine. Using this kind of machinery and equipment to cut parts can improve productivity. (Photo by Liu Yaohua from China Workers Pictorial)
　　Ling Manli, an intern female worker and member of the Youth League in the tool manufacturing workshop, is a junior high school student. Thanks to the active help of the technicians and her own efforts, she has mastered the operation technology of the most precise machine in the factory—the jig borer—after only a short year of study. The working accuracy of this boring machine is one ten-thousandth of an inch, which is equal to one-thirtieth of a hair.
　　Engineers and workers in the foundry workshop are studying the layout of the factory together.
　　The newly built office building.
　　In order to train a large number of outstanding technical workers, the Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant also has an affiliated technical school, where more than 600 young people from all over the country are studying. This is the scene of the students of the technical school going to the factory for practice.
　　In the process of construction, Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant has also cultivated many new workers from peasant backgrounds. Farmer Li Jiafu created a new working method in less than three months. This is the scene of Li Jiafu (right) and others working.
　　A large number of new-style workers' dormitories are under construction.
　　The newly built workers' hospital has the most complete medical equipment. This hospital has about eighty beds.

　　In order to solve the learning problems of workers' children, brand-new primary school buildings have been built.

    我国第一个新型的纺织机械制造厂
    这个纺织机械制造厂的机器设备全部都是高度现代化的。将来建成开始生产后，现代化的机械设备就可以减轻或代替了工人们的体力劳动。这是已经安装好的锭子车床，工人们正在试车。这台车床是完全自动化的，操纵的工人除按电钮和加原料外，是不必进行其他体力劳动的。
    经纬纺织机械制造厂是我国新建的第一个新型巨大的纺织机械制造工厂。两年多来，经过全体职工的努力和苏联及各兄弟国家的帮助，在晋中平原的荒地上，已经出现了宏大的厂房和高耸云霄的烟囱，这个工厂的建设工程，将在今年年内全部完成。这是该工厂工具机车间的排车工人在进行苏联制造的铣床试车工作时的情形。
    为了车间取暖的需要，该厂建造了巨大的煤气设备。这是正在建造中的巨型煤气罐。
    重型机车间的工人们在安装四轴龙门铣床。利用这种机械设备来进行机件的切削工作，可以提高生产率。（中国工人画刊　刘耀华摄）
    工具制造车间的实习女工、青年团团员凌曼丽，是个初中学生，由于技工们的积极帮助和她自己的努力，经过短短一年的学习就已经掌握了厂里最精密的机器——钻模镗床的操作技术。这部镗床的工作准确度是万分之一英寸，等于一根头发的三十分之一。
    铸工车间的工程师和工人们在一起研究工场的布置图。
    新建的办公大楼。
    为了培养大批优秀的技术工人，经纬纺织机械制造厂还附设有技术学校，六百多从各地来的青年正在这里学习。这是技术学校的学生们下厂实习时的情形。
    经纬纺织机械制造厂在建设过程中，还培植了许多农民出身的新工人。农民李家福在不到三个月的时间里，就创造了新的工作方法。这是李家福（右）等在工作时的情形。
    大批新式的工人宿舍正在建设中。
    新建中的工人医院，有最完善的医疗设备。这个医院有八十张左右的病床。

    为了解决工人子弟的学习问题，崭新的小学校舍已经建筑起来了。
