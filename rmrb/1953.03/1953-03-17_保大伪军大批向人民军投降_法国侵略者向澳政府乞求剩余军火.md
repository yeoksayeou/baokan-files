Xinhua News Agency: Under the influence of the successive victories of the Vietnamese People's Army, more and more Bao Dai puppet troops are unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for the French aggressors, and are surrendering to the People's Army in large numbers.

According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, shortly after 400 Bao Dai puppet troops surrendered to the People's Army, another company of puppet troops surrendered to the People's Army on January 22, bringing all their weapons with them. These puppet troops, stationed on Highway 5 connecting Hanoi to Haiphong, burned all eleven barracks along the highway and destroyed three bridges before defecting. The weapons they brought to the liberated area included two mortars, four machine guns, and seventy-one rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The French aggressors, having suffered successive defeats in Vietnam and squandered the weapons provided by the United States, are in dire straits and are even begging Australia for aid in the form of remaining military equipment.

In order to beg for aid, Letourneau, the French Minister of Relations with Associated States, personally traveled to Australia on March 8. During his first three days in Australia, he held meetings with the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Australian government. As a result of the talks, according to a communique issued on the 11th, the Australian government is determined to intervene in the Vietnamese People's Liberation War, and has decided to provide aircraft and military supplies to the French aggressor forces in Vietnam, and is prepared to provide economic assistance to the three puppet governments in Indochina.

Even so, the "aid" that Australia can give to France is only some remaining military equipment. In order to receive this dilapidated surplus equipment, France is preparing to send a military delegation to Australia in April to "determine what is usable and what is not." Australian Minister of Defense McBride has already revealed in advance that he expects the amount of equipment that France considers suitable will be "quite limited."

    法国侵略者向澳政府乞求剩余军火
    【新华社讯】在越南人民军节节胜利的影响下，越来越多的保大伪军不愿意充当法国侵略者的炮灰，大批地向人民军投降。
    据越南通讯社消息，继保大伪军四百人向人民军投降以后不久，一月二十二日又有伪军一个连携带全部武器投向人民军。这些驻扎在河内通往海防的第五号公路上的伪军，在反正以前把沿公路的十一座营房全部烧光，并毁坏了三座桥梁。他们带到解放区的武器包括迫击炮两门、机枪四挺和步枪七十一支。
    【新华社十六日讯】在越南接连吃了败仗并把美国援助的武器输光的法国侵略者，在山穷水尽之际，不惜乞求澳大利亚给予剩余军事装备的援助。
    为了乞求援助，法国联邦成员国关系部部长勒都尔诺在三月八日亲自跑到澳大利亚去。他在澳大利亚逗留的头三天中，和澳大利亚政府的总理、外长和陆海空军的部长们举行会议。会谈结果，据十一日发表的公报，澳大利亚政府决心干涉越南人民解放战争，决定提供飞机和军事物资给侵越法军使用，并准备给予印度支那的三个傀儡政府以经济援助。
    虽然如此，澳大利亚所能给予法国的“援助”只是一些剩余军事装备。为了接收这些破烂的剩余装备，法国准备在四月里派一个军事代表团到澳大利亚去，“确定那些东西能用，那些东西不能用”。澳大利亚国防部长麦克布莱德已经事先透露，他预料，法国认为合适的装备，为数将是“相当有限”。
