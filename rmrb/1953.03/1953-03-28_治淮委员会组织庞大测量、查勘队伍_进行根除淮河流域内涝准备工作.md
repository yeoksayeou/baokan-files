Survey personnel from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also participated in the work. During the measurement and survey, they will simultaneously investigate the local agricultural production situation, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the opinions of farmers on relieving waterlogging disasters, so that the planning and design of eradicating waterlogging projects can be conducive to the development of agricultural production.
