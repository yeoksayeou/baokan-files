    A New Type of Industrial University in China
    Under the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, Harbin Institute of Technology has corrected the serious shortcomings of teaching being divorced from practice, enriched the content of specialized courses, and established an advanced teaching system that closely integrates theory and practice, cultivating students' independent thinking and creativity. This is a scene of graduate students in the welding specialty group of the Department of Mechanical Engineering conducting welding experiments under the personal guidance of Soviet expert Pukholov.
    Three years ago, this place was still a wasteland. But in just three short years, many new classrooms and dormitories have been built, and another building covering more than 80,000 square meters is being constructed starting this year. Now, students can avoid holding meetings and studying in the open wasteland, braving the severe northwest wind and the hot sun, and they have a very comfortable learning environment.
    Harbin Institute of Technology is a new type of higher industrial school in China that has systematically learned from the advanced teaching experience of the Soviet Union and has relatively complete equipment. The school has three departments, thirteen specialty groups, twenty-three teaching and research sections, and twenty different types of well-equipped laboratories. In recent years, with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, it has cultivated many outstanding engineers for China's construction cause. This is the gate of the school.
    Graduate students in the mechanical manufacturing engineering specialty group of the Department of Mechanical Engineering are demonstrating spark cutting. Using this advanced Soviet spark cutting method can improve product quality more than using rapid cutting methods.
    Second-year students in the Department of Electrical Engineering are listening to a professor explain electrical measurements in the laboratory.
    Harbin Institute of Technology has a library with a rich collection of books. Professors and students throughout the school can borrow the reference books and materials they need from here.
    Students in the drafting room are learning the advanced Soviet drafting process.
    Second-year students in the Department of Civil Engineering are conducting metal tensile tests in the materials laboratory.
    During spare time and holidays, the sports field, club, and ice rink become the most active places for students.
    Xie Honghan, a fifth-year top student in the mechanical manufacturing engineering specialty group of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, has now graduated and is participating in the construction of the motherland. This is him carefully reviewing his graduation thesis before graduation.

    我国的一个新型工业大学
    在苏联专家的指导和帮助下，哈尔滨工业大学纠正了教学脱离实际的严重缺点，充实专门课程内容，建立了理论和实际密切结合的先进教学制度，培养同学们的独立思考和创造精神。这是机械系焊接专业组研究生在苏联专家普霍洛夫亲自指导下作电焊实验的情形。
    三年前，这里还是一片荒地。可是就在短短的三年里，许多座新的教室和宿舍建设起来了，今年起并在继续建设另一座占地八万多平方公尺的大楼。现在同学们可以不再冒着严寒的西北风和炎热的太阳在露天荒地上开会和学习，他们已经有了很安适的学习环境。
    哈尔滨工业大学是我国一个较有系统地学习了苏联先进教学经验和有着较完全的设备的新型高等工业学校。全校设有三个系十三个专业组、二十三个教学研究室和二十个种类不同、设备齐全的实验室。几年来，在苏联专家的热情帮助下，它已为我国建设事业培养了许多优秀的工程师。这是学校的大门。
    机械系机械制造工程专业组研究生在作火花切削的示范实习。运用苏联这种先进的火花切削操作方法，比用快速切削法更能提高产品质量。
    电工系二年级同学在实验室里听教授讲解电力的测量。
    哈尔滨工业大学附有一所藏书丰富的图书馆。全校教授和同学们都可以从这里借到他们所需要的参考图书和资料。
    制图室的同学们在学习苏联先进的制图过程。
    土木系二年级同学在材料实验室里进行金属拉力的试验工作。
    在课余时间和休假日，运动场、俱乐部和冰场就变成了同学们最活跃的地方。
    机械系机械制造工程专业组五年级优等生谢鸿汉，现在他已经毕业参加祖国的建设工作了。这是他在毕业前专心地审阅自己的毕业论文时的情形。
