The School Work Committee of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to consolidate the achievements of ideological remolding of teachers in institutions of higher learning and rapidly improve the political and theoretical level of teachers, established the Harbin Municipal Colleges and Universities Teachers' Amateur Political School in October last year. Running this kind of amateur political school is one of the better organizational forms for conducting regular and systematic Marxist-Leninist education for teachers.

Participating in the Harbin Municipal Colleges and Universities Teachers' Amateur Political School were: faculty and staff from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin Medical University, Harbin Railway Institute, Harbin Foreign Language School, Northeast Agricultural College, Northeast Forestry College, and Songjiang Provincial Teachers College, totaling 1,080 people. Zheng Yiping, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, serves as the principal of the school, with a school committee (including one person each from the leaders and teachers of each institution) responsible for the specific work of the school.

The school first used Ai Siqi's "Historical Materialism - History of Social Development" as the learning material; it is required that through this study, a preliminary historical materialist viewpoint be established. The study is divided into two classes, and each class is further divided into study groups (about ten people per group) according to the department or subject of the teachers participating in the study from each institution. Lecturers are appointed from the leaders of each institution, the heads of the political education research offices, and the heads of the education department of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The faculty and staff participating in the study showed extremely high learning enthusiasm. No matter how cold the weather or how far the road, they arrived on time to the designated place to attend lectures. After this stage of study, many teachers felt that their horizons had been broadened. They gained a relatively deep understanding of the basic concepts such as the inevitable demise of capitalism, the inevitable victory of socialism, labor creates the world, and individualism and subjectivism are incorrect ideologies. Some teachers in the Veterinary Medicine Department of Northeast Agricultural College felt that the study of the "History of Social Development" greatly helped their work, and they gained a deeper understanding of Darwinism, Pavlov's theory, and so on. After studying, some teachers strengthened their sense of responsibility, improved their enthusiasm for learning from the Soviet Union, and became more concerned about national construction and the development of the international situation than in the past.

The reason why the Harbin Municipal Colleges and Universities Teachers' Amateur Political School has achieved preliminary gains is primarily because most teachers have improved their political awareness after the ideological remolding movement and have developed a conscious learning requirement. Many teacher study groups at Northeast Agricultural College have formulated learning covenants to ensure good study. Secondly, it is because the leaders of each school attach great importance to teachers' political study. Most of the leaders of each institution personally serve as lecturers. Political instructors from Harbin Medical University and Harbin Railway Institute went deep into each study group to help teachers study and help answer difficult questions in their studies. Zou Baoxiang, director of the Political Education Research Office of Northeast Agricultural College, took the time to convene meetings of the study group leaders before each discussion to provide specific and detailed study guidance, explain the key points of study, the central purpose, and the issues that should be paid attention to in the discussion. The lecturers also prepared their lessons carefully and explained them in connection with reality.

The experience of the Harbin Colleges and Universities Teachers' Amateur Political School proves that after the teachers' ideological remolding movement, timely organizing teachers to systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, is an important link in consolidating and expanding the achievements of the teachers' ideological remolding movement. Running a regular amateur political school is a better organizational form for conducting this kind of education. This is because: First, the lecturers in amateur political schools are of high quality and the resources are concentrated, making it easy to persevere in learning; second, teachers in institutions of higher learning have heavy workloads and a poor theoretical foundation, and they rarely have time to study during normal times. Organizing them can help them develop learning habits and prevent their amateur self-study from becoming a mere formality; third, unified and centralized study facilitates leadership, inspection, and control of the learning progress, and systematic political theory education can be gradually展开.(Xinhua News Agency)

### 哈尔滨大专学校教师业余政治学校是教师系统学习马列主义的较好组织形式

    哈尔滨大专学校教师业余政治学校是教师系统学习马列主义的较好组织形式
    中共哈尔滨市委员会学校工作委员会为巩固高等学校教师思想改造的成果，迅速提高教师的政治理论水平，在去年十月间建立了哈尔滨市大专学校教师业余政治学校。开办这种业余的政治学校，是对教师进行经常的有系统的马克思列宁主义教育的较好的组织形式之一。
    参加哈尔滨市大专学校教师业余政治学校学习的有：哈尔滨工业大学、哈尔滨医科大学、哈尔滨铁道学院、哈尔滨外国语专科学校、东北农学院、东北林学院以及松江省立师范专科学校的教职员等共一千零八十人。中共哈尔滨市委员会宣传部部长郑依平担任该校校长，下设学校委员会（吸收各院校负责人、教师各一人参加），负责学校的具体工作。
    该校首先以艾思奇的“历史唯物论——社会发展史”为学习材料；要求通过这一学习达到树立初步的历史唯物主义观点。学习共分为两班，班下又按各院校参加学习的教师所属系、科编成学习小组
    （每组十人左右）。讲师则分别聘请各院校的负责人或政治教育研究室的负责人和中共哈尔滨市委员会教育处的负责人等担任。
    参加学习的教职员，在学习中表现了极为高涨的学习情绪，不管天怎样冷，路怎样远，都按时到指定地点去听课。经过这一阶段的学习，很多教师都感到眼界扩大了，对于资本主义必然灭亡，社会主义必然胜利，劳动创造世界，个人主义、主观主义是错误的思想意识等基本观念都从理论上获得了比较深刻的认识。东北农学院兽医系的某些教师感到“社会发展史”的学习对业务有很大的帮助，对达尔文主义、巴甫洛夫学说等的理解更深入了一步。有些教师在学习后，工作责任感加强了，学习苏联的积极性提高了，对国家建设和国际局势的发展，也比过去更加关心了。
    哈尔滨市大专学校教师业余政治学校所以能够有初步的收获，首先是由于大部分教师在思想改造运动后，政治觉悟有了提高，产生了自觉的学习要求。东北农学院的许多教师学习小组都订立了学习公约，保证搞好学习。其次，是由于各校领导人对教师政治学习都很重视，各院校负责人大多亲自担任讲师。哈尔滨医科大学、哈尔滨铁道学院的政治教员都深入各学习小组帮助教师进行学习，帮助解答学习中的疑难问题；东北农学院政治教育研究室主任邹宝骧在每次讨论会前，都争取时间召开学习小组长会议，对他们做具体细致的学习指导：交代学习要点、中心目的和讨论中应注意的问题。讲师们也都认真备课，联系实际讲解。
    哈尔滨大专学校教师业余政治学校的经验证明，在教师思想改造运动后，及时地组织教师进行系统的马克思列宁主义及马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的学习，是巩固和扩大教师思想改造运动成果的重要一环；而开办正规的业余政治学校，则是进行这种教育的较好的组织形式。这是因为：一、业余政治学校的讲师质量高、力量集中，容易把学习坚持下来；二、高等学校教师工作任务重，理论基础差，平时又很少有时间学习，组织起来后，可帮助他们养成学习习惯，使他们的业余自修不至于流于形式；三、统一集中的学习便于领导、检查，便于掌握学习进度，可以逐步展开有系统的政治理论教育。（新华社）
