The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, after jointly studying the suggestion made by General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, on February 22, 1953, regarding the prior exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war of both sides during the war, unanimously believe that this issue can be reasonably resolved in accordance with Article 109 of the 1949 Geneva Convention. A reasonable solution to the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war is obviously of extreme importance for the smooth resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue. Therefore, we believe that the time has come to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue to guarantee the cessation of the Korean War and the conclusion of an armistice agreement.

The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea unanimously advocate that the armistice negotiation representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers should immediately begin negotiations with the armistice negotiation representatives of the United Nations Command on the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war during the war, and further seek a comprehensive solution to the prisoner of war issue.

The Korean armistice negotiations over the past year or more have laid the foundation for achieving an armistice in Korea. In the negotiations at Kaesong and Panmunjom, the representatives of both sides have reached agreement on all issues except for the prisoner of war issue. First of all, regarding the Korean ceasefire issue of global concern, both sides have agreed that "The commanders of both sides shall order and ensure that all armed forces under their control, including all units and personnel of the army, navy, and air force, shall completely cease all hostile acts in Korea, and the complete cessation of these hostile acts shall take effect twelve hours after the signing of this armistice agreement." (Article 12 of the Draft Korean Armistice Agreement) Secondly, both sides have also agreed on various important armistice conditions. On the issue of determining the military demarcation line and establishing a demilitarized zone, both sides have agreed that the military demarcation line shall be the line of actual contact between the two sides at the time the armistice agreement takes effect, and "each side shall withdraw two kilometers from this line in order to establish a demilitarized zone between the opposing armies... as a buffer zone to prevent events that may lead to a recurrence of hostile acts." (Article 1 of the Draft) On the issue of supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement and handling violations of the armistice agreement, both sides have agreed that a Military Armistice Commission shall be formed, composed of five senior officers jointly appointed by the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and five senior officers appointed by the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, to be responsible for supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement, including guidance for the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, and to consult on handling any violations of the armistice agreement (Articles 19, 20, 24, 25, and 56 of the Draft); both sides also agreed that two senior officers appointed by Poland and Czechoslovakia, jointly nominated by the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, as representatives, and two senior officers appointed by Sweden and Switzerland, nominated by the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, shall form a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and be equipped with officers from the aforementioned countries as members to form Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, stationed in Sinuiju, Chongjin, Hungnam, Manpo, Sinanju in North Korea and Incheon, Daegu, Busan, Gangneung, Gunsan in South Korea, to supervise and inspect the implementation of the provisions on stopping the entry of reinforcing military personnel and combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea (except for those permitted for rotation and replacement), and may conduct special observations and inspections at locations outside the demilitarized zone where violations of the armistice agreement are reported, to ensure the stability of the military armistice (Articles 36, 37, 40, 41, 42, and 43 of Draft). In addition, both sides have agreed that "The military commanders of both sides hereby suggest to the governments of the relevant countries of both sides that within three months after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement, representatives be dispatched to convene a higher-level political conference of both sides to discuss issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue." (Article 60 of the Draft)

As mentioned above, in the Korean armistice negotiations, only the prisoner of war issue is hindering the realization of the Korean armistice. And even on the prisoner of war issue, except for the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, all clauses in the draft armistice agreement regarding the arrangement of prisoners of war have been agreed upon by both sides. If the Korean armistice negotiations had not been interrupted for more than five months, a solution to this prisoner of war repatriation issue might have been found long ago.

Now that the United Nations Command has suggested resolving the issue of prior exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war during the war in accordance with Article 109 of the Geneva Convention, we believe that with the reasonable resolution of the issue of sick and wounded prisoners of war, as long as both sides truly have the sincerity to make mutual concessions to facilitate the Korean armistice, the smooth resolution of the entire prisoner of war issue should be entirely possible.

Regarding the prisoner of war issue, the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have always believed, and still believe, that only in accordance with the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention, especially Article 118 of the Convention, that prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the armistice is a reasonable solution. However, given that the differences between the two sides on this issue are the only obstacle to reaching a Korean armistice, and in order to satisfy the world people's desire for peace, the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, based on the consistent peace policy, based on the consistent efforts to quickly achieve a Korean armistice and strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, in order to maintain and consolidate world peace, are prepared to take steps to eliminate the differences on this issue to facilitate the Korean armistice. For this purpose, the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea propose that the negotiating parties should guarantee the immediate repatriation after the armistice of all prisoners of war they have detained who insist on repatriation, and that the remaining prisoners of war be handed over to neutral countries to ensure a fair resolution of their repatriation issues.

It must be pointed out that this proposal of ours does not abandon the principle of Article 118 of the Geneva Convention regarding the release and repatriation of prisoners of war without delay after the armistice, nor does it recognize the so-called "refusal to repatriate" among the prisoners of war as claimed by the United Nations Command. It is only because ending the bloody war in Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue are related to the peace and security of the Far East and the people of the world, that we have taken this new step, preparing to hand over to neutral countries, after the armistice, our captured personnel who are fearful and dare not return home under the coercion and oppression of the other side, and after explanation from relevant parties, to ensure that their repatriation issues can be resolved fairly, and not thereby hinder the realization of the Korean armistice.

We believe that this new step taken by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in order to end the Korean War is fully in line with the vital interests of the people of both sides who have their children fighting in Korea, and is also fully in line with the fundamental interests of the people of the world. If the United Nations Command has sincerity in seeking peace, our proposal should be acceptable.

Beijing, March 30, 1953

    我政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来
    关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在共同研究了联合国军总司令克拉克将军于一九五三年二月二十二日提出的关于在战争期间先行交换双方病伤战俘的建议之后，一致认为根据一九四九年日内瓦公约第一百零九条的规定，这一问题完全可以得到合理的解决。关于交换病伤战俘问题的合理解决，对于顺利解决全部战俘问题显然具有极重大的意义。因之，我们认为，解决全部战俘问题以保证停止朝鲜战争并缔结停战协定的时机，应当说是已经到来了。
    中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一致主张，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的停战谈判代表应即与联合国军停战谈判代表开始关于在战争期间交换病伤战俘问题的谈判，并进而谋取战俘问题的通盘解决。
    过去一年多的朝鲜停战谈判，已经奠定了在朝鲜实现停战的基础。在开城和板门店的谈判中，双方代表除对战俘一项问题外已对所有问题达成协议。首先，对于举世关心的朝鲜停火问题，双方已经同意，“双方司令官命令并保证其控制下的一切武装力量，包括陆、海、空军的一切部队与人员，完全停止在朝鲜的一切敌对行为，此项敌对行为的完全停止自本停战协定签字后十二小时起生效。”（朝鲜停战协定草案第十二款）其次，双方还曾商定各项重要停战条件。在关于确定军事分界线和建立非军事区问题上，双方已经同意，以停战协定生效时双方实际接触线为军事分界线，“双方各由此线后退二公里，以便在敌对军队之间建立一非军事区……作为缓冲区，以防止发生可能导致敌对行为复发的事件。”（草案第一款）在关于监督停战协定的实施及处理违反停战协定事件的问题上，双方已经同意由朝鲜人民军最高司令官与中国人民志愿军司令员所共同指派的五名高级军官和由联合国军总司令所指派的五名高级军官组成军事停战委员会，负责监督停战协定的实施，包括对于战俘遣返委员会的督导，并协商处理任何违反停战协定的事件（草案第十九、二十、二十四、二十五、五十六各款）；双方并同意由朝鲜人民军最高司令官与中国人民志愿军司令员所共同提名的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克指派两位高级军官作代表和由联合国军总司令所提名的瑞典、瑞士指派两位高级军官作代表组成中立国监察委员会，并在其下配备由上述各国派出的军官为组员组成中立国视察小组，分驻于北朝鲜的新义州、清津、兴南、满浦、新安州和南朝鲜的仁川、大邱、釜山、江陵、群山各口岸，以监督与视察双方对于停止自朝鲜境外进入增援的军事人员和作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药的条款的实施（条款中准许轮换和替换者除外），并得至非军事区以外据报发生违反停战协定事件的地点进行特别观察与视察，以保证军事停战的稳定（草案第三十六、三十七、四十、四十一、四十二、四十三各款）。此外，双方还商定“双方军事司令官兹向双方有关各国政府建议在停战协定签字并生效后的三个月内，分派代表召开双方高一级的政治会议，协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题。”（草案第六十款）
    如上所述，在朝鲜停战谈判中，只有一个战俘问题阻碍着朝鲜停战的实现。而且就在战俘问题上，除战俘遣返问题外，双方在停战协定草案中对于有关战俘的安排问题的一切条款亦均已达成协议。如非朝鲜停战谈判中断五个多月之久，则这个战俘遣返问题可能早已找出解决的办法来了。
    现在联合国军方面既然建议按照日内瓦公约第一百零九条的规定，解决在战争期间先行交换病伤战俘问题，我们认为，随着病伤战俘问题的合理解决，只要双方都真正具有互相让步以促成朝鲜停战的诚意，全部战俘问题的顺利解决，是完全应当的。
    关于战俘问题，中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一向认为，现在仍然认为，只有根据一九四九年日内瓦公约的规定，特别是该公约第一百一十八条的规定，停战后战俘即予释放并遣返，不得迟延，才是合理的解决。但是鉴于双方在这个问题上的分歧是目前达成朝鲜停战的唯一障碍，并且为满足世界人民的和平愿望，中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府本着一贯坚持的和平政策，本着一贯努力于迅速实现朝鲜停战，争取和平解决朝鲜问题，以维持和巩固世界和平的立场，准备采取步骤来消除在这个问题上的分歧，以促成朝鲜停战。为此目的，中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提议：谈判双方应保证在停战后立即遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余的战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。
    必须指出，我们这一提议，并非放弃了日内瓦公约第一百一十八条关于停战后战俘即予释放并遣返，不得迟延的原则，也非承认了联合国军方面所说的战俘中有所谓拒绝遣返的人，只由于终止朝鲜流血战争及和平解决朝鲜问题是关系到远东及世界人民的和平与安全问题，所以我们才采取这一新的步骤，准备将在对方恐吓和压迫下心存疑惧、不敢回家的我方被俘人员，提议在停战后转交中立国，并经过有关方面的解释，以保证他们的遣返问题能得到公正解决，而不致因此阻碍朝鲜停战的实现。
    我们相信，中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为了结束朝鲜战争所采取的这一新的步骤，完全符合于有自己子弟在朝鲜作战的双方人民的切身利益，也完全符合于全世界人民的根本利益。如果联合国军方面对于谋取和平具有诚意的话，我方这个建议是应该能够被接受的。
        一九五三年三月三十日于北京
