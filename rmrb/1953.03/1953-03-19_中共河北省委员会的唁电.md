Telegram of Condolences from the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia:

    Upon hearing the news of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Klement Gottwald, we, with immense grief, extend our heartfelt condolences on behalf of the 1,040,000 Communist Party members and 36 million people of the entire province.

    Comrade Gottwald was the wise leader of the Czechoslovak people and an outstanding fighter of the world's working class and the camp of peace and democracy. The passing of Comrade Gottwald is a significant loss for the peace-loving people of the world. We firmly believe that the standard-bearer of the Czechoslovak communist movement—Comrade Gottwald—will forever live in the hearts of the people. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, we must strengthen the resistance against America and aid to Korea, develop production, and, together with the Czechoslovak people, fight to the end for the victory of the cause of safeguarding lasting world peace and people's democracy.

                        The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
