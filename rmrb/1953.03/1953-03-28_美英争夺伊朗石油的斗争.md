US-British Struggle for Iranian Oil

The struggle between US and British imperialism for oil resources is particularly fierce in the Middle East. Before World War II, Britain controlled 80 percent of Middle Eastern oil production, while the United States controlled only 13 percent; after the war, the United States surpassed Britain, controlling 70 percent by 1951.

Iranian oil, monopolized by the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, had fattened British capitalists. For half a century, Britain plundered more than 300 million tons of oil from Iran, profiting $5 to $6 billion. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's annual oil production increased every year, reaching 32 million tons in 1950.

After monopolizing oil exploration rights in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and splitting Kuwait's oil with Britain, US oil monopolies turned their offensive towards the oil fields of southern Iran. By 1947, the United States had already acquired 20 percent of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's shares and 40 percent of its products. However, the United States was not satisfied with its vested interests; it tried to squeeze Britain out of Iran in an attempt to monopolize Iranian oil. In March 1951, when the Iranian people's struggle against British plundering policies and for oil nationalization reached its climax, the United States attempted to seize the opportunity to wrest Iranian oil exploration rights from Britain. US agents assassinated Razmara, the former Iranian Prime Minister and British lackey who opposed oil nationalization, on March 7 of the same year, and pretended to support the Iranian government's measures to nationalize oil. When Britain hoped to resolve the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute by splitting profits in order to ease the Iranian people's struggle, US oil companies tempted the Iranian government with even higher profit sharing percentages. The American "Aramco" even stated that it was willing to give 72 percent of its total profits to the Iranian government. The company even preemptively declared that if Iran auctioned off the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's assets, it would definitely buy them.

However, the Iranian people rejected this shameful bait from the United States. They were unwilling to be exploited by another new "Anglo-Iranian Oil Company" run by Americans. They demanded not only the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, but also the recovery of sovereignty over Bahrain and the US oil privileges on the island. This alarmed the US ruling group, and when the Iranian government implemented the oil nationalization plan, it desperately obstructed it.

In June 1951, after the Iranian government announced the implementation of oil nationalization, the British government dispatched cruisers to the Persian Gulf and deployed troops on the border between Iraq and Iran, threatening Iran. At the same time, it announced a blockade of Iranian oil exports and froze Iran's sterling deposits. Britain did this partly to force the Iranian government to submit, and partly to counter the US seizure of Iranian oil. At this time, the United States again pretended to be "generous," proposing a loan of $25 million to Iran, nominally to "help" Iran solve its financial difficulties, but actually to take advantage of the chaos. Moreover, the United States ignored the British blockade and continued to ship oil out of Iran. This inevitably aroused British dissatisfaction and resistance. For example, the Italian tanker "Rose Mary," backed by American businessmen, was detained by the British authorities in the Gulf of Aden for transporting 1,000 tons of oil from Iran.

In July and August 1951, Averell Harriman, former US President Truman's special envoy, held negotiations with the Iranian government as a "mediator." Harriman suggested using American experts to replace the British experts who had been driven out of Iran in order to restore production in the stalled oil industry. Harriman also demanded to purchase Iranian oil on terms favorable to the United States. In October of the same year, former US Assistant Secretary of State McGhee made the same request to Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh.

In January 1952, representatives of the "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development," controlled by the United States, participated in negotiations with the Iranian government. The bank demanded that the Iranian government transfer the rights of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to it, thereby abolishing the oil industry nationalization law. It also demanded that the Iranian government sell oil at prices far below the world market. But Iran rejected this "well-intentioned assistance."

At the end of August 1952, Truman and Churchill jointly wrote to Mossadegh, making three suggestions: that the Iranian government submit the issue of compensation for the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which was controlled by the US and British governments, for discussion, and that the Iranian government send representatives to negotiate with the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The suggestion stated that after Mossadegh accepted these two conditions, the United States would grant Iran a $10 million loan, and Britain would unfreeze Iran's deposits. The US monopoly capital group knew that the Iranian government was unable to make "compensation" to Britain; to "compensate," it would inevitably have to borrow money from the United States, so that the United States could seize Iranian oil. However, the US attempt to exchange $10 million for Iranian sovereignty was strongly opposed by the Iranian people. As a result, under the pressure of the people, the Iranian government rejected the joint US-British suggestion.

Soon after, Jones, the manager of the American "Cities Service Oil Company," went to Tehran, the capital of Iran, to engage in activities. His main purpose was to break the British blockade. British business and diplomatic circles expressed extreme anxiety and dissatisfaction with this matter. On September 18, the official spokesperson of the British Foreign Office declared: "Britain will oppose any attempt to export oil from Iran by breaking the British blockade." At that time, the British Ambassador to the United States, Franks, also delivered a written warning from the British government to Acheson. However, on December 6, the US State Department issued a statement saying: "If Britain attempts to detain oil tankers carrying oil purchased by American companies, the State Department knows how to protect them." In the same month, at a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in Paris, former US Secretary of State Acheson suggested to British Foreign Secretary Eden that the Iranian oil enterprise be transferred to an "international consortium" composed of US oil companies, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and Royal Dutch Shell to handle. Acheson's suggestion certainly did not please British capitalists. The British "Sunday Express" said it was "to legalize the plunder of Britain." The newspaper said: "According to the American plan, the sovereignty over the exploitation of Iranian oil resources will be transferred to the hands of powerful American companies."

Due to the resolute struggle of the Iranian people, Britain saw that it was practically impossible to restore its control over Iranian oil. On the other hand, it also saw that the United States, as an "ally," was openly and secretly plundering without relaxation, so it was temporarily forced to concede, only insisting that Iran "compensate" for the "losses" of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. On February 20 this year, the British government, through the US Ambassador to Iran, Henderson, made a suggestion to the Iranian government. This suggestion was nominally a British suggestion, but in reality, it was a joint US-British suggestion. This suggestion was basically no different from the joint suggestion made by Truman and Churchill last August. Its purpose was still to extort compensation from Iran to Britain, and to transfer control of Iranian oil from Britain to the United States. People can see that this is clearly a trick by US and British bandits to divide the spoils. However, due to the strong opposition of the Iranian people, the calculations of the US and British imperialists have not been successful. Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh officially rejected this new suggestion on March 20. The despicable plot of the imperialists to plunder Iranian oil has once again suffered a shameful failure.

### 美英争夺伊朗石油的斗争

    美英争夺伊朗石油的斗争
    美英帝国主义争夺石油资源的斗争，在中东地区表现得特别激烈。第二次世界大战以前，中东石油产品百分之八十控制在英国手里，美国仅控制着百分之十三；战后美国则压倒英国，一九五一年时即控制了百分之七十。
    在英国英伊石油公司垄断下的伊朗石油，曾经喂肥了英国的大资本家。半个世纪以来，英国从伊朗掠走三亿多吨石油，获利达五、六十亿美元。英伊石油公司石油年产量每年都在增加，一九五○年时高达三千二百万吨。
    美国的石油垄断资本在独占了沙特阿拉伯和巴林群岛的石油开采权、并同英国平分科威特石油之后，就把进攻的矛头指向伊朗南部油田。一九四七年，美国已取得英伊石油公司的百分之二十的股份和百分之四十的产品。但是美国并不以既得利益为满足，它竭力在伊朗排挤英国，企图独占伊朗石油。 一九五一年三月，当伊朗人民反对英国掠夺政策及争取石油国有化的斗争达高潮时，美国就企图乘机把伊朗石油开采权从英国手里抢夺过来。美国特务于同年三月七日暗杀了不赞成石油国有化的前伊朗首相、英国走狗拉兹马拉，并假装支持伊朗政府将石油收归国有的措施。当英国为了缓和伊朗人民的斗争，希望用平分利润的办法来解决英伊石油纠纷时，美国石油公司纷纷以更高的利润分配额引诱伊朗政府，美国的“阿美石油公司”更表示它愿意把营利总额的百分之七十二分给伊朗政府。该公司甚至预先声明：如果伊朗拍卖英伊石油公司的企业，它一定要把这些企业买到手。
    但是，伊朗人民拒绝美国这种可耻的诱饵，他们不愿意再受到另外一个由美国人主办的新的“英伊石油公司”的剥削。他们不仅要求把英伊石油公司收归国有，而且也要求收回巴林群岛的主权和美国在该岛的石油特权。这一来，美国统治集团着慌了，当伊朗政府将石油国有化方案付诸实施时，它就又拼命阻挠。
    一九五一年六月，伊朗政府宣布实行石油国有化后，英国政府调遣巡洋舰到波斯湾，并陈兵伊拉克与伊朗边境，对伊朗进行威胁，同时宣布封锁伊朗石油出口，冻结伊朗的英镑存款。英国这样做的目的，一方面是企图压迫伊朗政府屈服，一方面是为了对付美国对伊朗石油的抢夺。这时，美国又假装“慷慨”，提出贷款二千五百万美元给伊朗的建议，名义上是“帮助”伊朗解决财政困难，实际上是想趁机混水摸鱼。而且美国并不理会英国的封锁，一直从伊朗不断运出石油。这不能不引起英国的不满和抵抗。例如，以美国商人为后台老板的意大利油船“玫瑰玛利号”，因为从伊朗运出一千吨石油，曾在亚丁湾被英国当局扣留。
    一九五一年七、八月间，前美国总统杜鲁门的特使哈里曼以“调停人”的身份和伊朗政府进行了谈判。哈里曼建议用美国专家来代替那些被赶出伊朗的英国专家，以便恢复陷于停顿的石油企业的生产，哈里曼并要求在有利于美国的条件下购买伊朗石油。同年十月，前美国助理国务卿麦克希向伊朗首相摩萨台提出与此相同的要求。
    一九五二年一月，在美国控制下的“国际复兴开发银行”的代表参加了对伊朗政府的谈判。该银行要求伊朗政府把前英伊石油公司的权利转让给它，从而废除石油工业国有化的法案，它还要求伊朗政府以远低于世界市场的价格出售石油。但伊朗拒绝了这种“善意的协助”。
    一九五二年八月底，杜鲁门和邱吉尔联名致函摩萨台，提出了三项建议，要求伊朗政府把关于前英伊石油公司的赔偿问题提交由美英政府把持的海牙国际法庭讨论，并要求伊朗政府派遣代表和前英伊石油公司进行谈判。该建议说：在摩萨台接受了这两个条件之后，美国将给予伊朗一千万美元贷款，英国将解冻伊朗的存款。美国垄断资本集团知道伊朗政府无力对英国进行“赔偿”，要“赔偿”，势必向美国借款，这样一来，美国就可以夺取伊朗石油了。但是，美国用一千万美元来换取伊朗主权的企图，遭到伊朗人民的强烈反对。结果在人民的压力下，伊朗政府拒绝了美英的联合建议。
    不久以后，美国“城市石油服务公司”经理琼斯到伊朗首都德黑兰活动，他的主要目的是想打破英国的封锁。英国企业界和外交界人士对此事表示极度焦虑和不满。九月十八日，英国外交部官方发言人宣称：“英国对冲破英国封锁从伊朗输出石油的一切企图，都将予以反对。”当时的英国驻美大使佛朗克斯又向艾奇逊递送英国政府的书面警告。但是，十二月六日，美国国务院发表声明说：“如果英国企图扣留装运美国公司所买石油的油船，国务院知道如何来保护它们。”同月，北大西洋侵略集团理事会在巴黎开会时，前美国国务卿艾奇逊向英国外相艾登提出以下建议：将伊朗石油企业移交给由美国石油公司、英伊石油公司和英荷壳牌公司组成的“国际联营公司”来处理。艾奇逊的这一建议当然不能使英国资本家称心。英国“星期日快报”说它是“使掠夺英国的行为合法化。”该报说：“依照美国的计划，开采伊朗石油资源的主权将转移到强大的美国公司的手里。”
    由于伊朗人民的坚决斗争，英国看到要再恢复对伊朗石油的控制地位，事实上已不可能；另一方面，它也看到作为“盟友”的美国又明抢暗夺毫不放松，因而暂时被迫让步，只是坚持要求伊朗“赔偿”英伊石油公司的“损失”。今年二月二十日，英国政府通过美国驻伊朗大使汉德逊向伊朗政府提出建议。这一建议名义上是英国的建议，实际上是美英的联合建议。这个建议和去年八月杜鲁门和邱吉尔的联合建议，基本上没有什么不同，目的仍在勒索伊朗对英赔款，并把伊朗石油的控制权从英国移交给美国。人们可以看出，这明明是英美强盗分赃的把戏。但是，在伊朗人民的强烈反对下，英美帝国主义的盘算并不如意，伊朗首相摩萨台已于三月二十日正式拒绝了这个新建议。帝国主义者掠夺伊朗石油的卑鄙阴谋又一次遭到可耻的失败。（孟宪谟）
