The Office of the Heilongjiang Province Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee dispatched a work group to conduct a pilot program for the implementation of the Marriage Law Movement in Mengkeli Village, Guo Hou Banner, consistently adhering to the educational approach, which resulted in good results.

Mengkeli Village is a village in Heilongjiang Province where various tasks are relatively well-done. Over the past two years, some achievements have also been made in implementing the Marriage Law: arranged and bought marriages have basically disappeared, social interactions between young men and women are open, and free marriage has gained the support of public opinion. However, marital discord and disharmony between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law are still quite common. Even among village cadres, many beat their wives.

When the work group first arrived in the village, village cadres had three reactions: The first type of cadre (especially women and youth cadres) actively supported the movement. They happily said, "This time, the methods are being taught right at our doorstep. We must study hard, or we'll miss this opportunity!" The second type of cadre adopted an avoidance attitude towards the movement. Some of them had beaten their wives, and some had problems in the implementation and execution of the Marriage Law, fearing to make self-criticisms to the masses and fearing punishment. The third type of cadre had a sense of annoyance, adopting a passive attitude towards the movement, mainly fearing it would affect production, or believing that there were no arranged marriages in the village, "so there is no need for further implementation."

Among the masses, most expressed support for the Marriage Law, especially young people and women. However, some had concerns and vague understandings. For example, married adults with relatively good marital relationships believed that the Marriage Law was irrelevant to them. Some elderly people feared that implementing the Marriage Law would "disrupt the order of things," saying, "In the past, high mountains couldn't block the sun, and men had the final say. Now that there is equality, no one even considers what old people say!" Among men, there was a relatively widespread idea of male superiority, saying, "A cat can catch mice, and a man can be the master. How can you manage if you can't control your wife?" As for men who had beaten their wives in the past and mothers-in-law who had mistreated their daughters-in-law, upon hearing that the work group had arrived, they were somewhat timid, fearing divorce and punishment. Some men quickly showed concern for their wives, saying, "From now on, you can attend any meeting, and I will take care of the children!" and prepared to "confess." However, some secretly pinched their wives at night, angrily saying, "I don't care about any Marriage Law, it's just a call for divorce!"

The first step the work group took to carry out its work was to organize village cadres to study. In their studies, the focus was on positive education, repeatedly publicizing the purpose and significance of implementing the Marriage Law, and the principles and methods of this movement. Cadres who feared punishment said after listening, "This time, it's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders." Due to the repeated publicity of the purpose and significance of the movement, some cadres also corrected the mistaken view of opposing the implementation of the Marriage Law with production. The work group also helped village cadres arrange various tasks and made clear divisions of labor, so that various tasks were well integrated. At the end of the study, the village cadres were organized to summarize their learning gains and conduct self-examinations. Finally, a Party branch meeting was held, and many cadres made self-criticisms of feudal ideas and engaged in mutual criticism.

After the cadres studied, they widely publicized and explained the Marriage Law among the masses, convened people's representative meetings and mass discussion meetings, performed plays, and held small exhibitions. Experience has proven that as long as it is made clear that the purpose of implementing the Marriage Law is to establish democratic, harmonious, united, and productive happy families, the various concerns of the masses will be quickly eliminated, and a large number of activists will emerge. These activists include not only young people and women but also middle-aged and elderly people. Old Mrs. Liu used to fear that her children would not support her after they had free marriage, but now she says, "If they don't support us old couple, the government won't allow it either. The Marriage Law says it very clearly!"

There were no serious marital disputes in Mengkeli Village, but men beating their wives was relatively common, including some village cadres. In the past, they thought this was normal; some village cadres, at the beginning of the study, seeing others making self-criticisms about beating their wives, also smiled and got up from the kang (platform bed), touched their buttocks, and said, "I beat her too. You tell me, how can you not beat her when she acts like that!" Regarding this issue, the work group, adhering to the principle of addressing the issue rather than the person, pointed out that this was a bad behavior left over from the old society, and only puppet Manchukuo police and landlords beat people; in the new society, couples are equal, and anyone with shortcomings should be helped to overcome them. Beating people is shameful. This can enable the masses to recognize that men beating people is an addiction to the bad habits of the old society and hate the old society and the old marriage system, to avoid deepening family conflicts. Cadres who beat their wives have changed after learning, and they use their own examples to publicize among the masses (such as cooperative director Li Zizhou changed from beating and scolding his wife to discussing things with his wife), and the masses received a great education.

In the pilot work in Mengkeli Village, hasty and rude practices were prevented, the publicity work was thorough and meticulous, and it was closely combined with local practical examples, so the results were very significant. For example, the situation of village cadre Du Qinghai beating his wife was relatively serious. The comrades of the work group repeatedly talked to him, with full enthusiasm and patient persuasion. Finally, he was moved and said, "I am a Communist Party member. If I don't change after being educated like this, can I be worthy of the title of Communist Party member!"

After universally publicizing the Marriage Law, the masses will raise many questions, so further organizing the masses to study the Marriage Law, especially holding good mass discussion meetings, is an important part of propaganda and education. At the discussion meetings, encourage everyone to learn from the good examples. The discussion meetings should not take the form of mutual exposure and criticism, to avoid forming antagonism between families and between the masses and creating struggle.

When the discussion meetings are well-run, not only will the masses' understanding of certain issues be unified, but general family disputes will also be resolved. Xiao Jingchun was a famous wife-beater in Mengkeli Village. He would beat her if things were not to his liking, and even beat her for not giving birth to a son. After the discussion meeting and individual education, he woke up and said sadly, "I carried burdens for the landlord for more than twenty years and was always bullied by the landlord; now that I am no longer bullied, I oppress my wife. This is too wrong." Now he not only does not beat his wife, but also helps his wife cook and take care of the children, and lets her go to the theater. Old Mrs. Jiang, who had been at odds with her daughter-in-law for many years, also recognized her past problems, which made her daughter-in-law moved and said, "My little stubborn temper must also be changed!"

From the mass discussion meetings, the law of the masses' ideological development was initially explored. For example, when men hold discussion meetings, in the early stage, they mostly raise questions from the negative side, such as asking, "Why do people who marry freely still get divorced?" "Do all arranged marriages have to be divorced?" "Why should women take property when they ask for a divorce?" "The Marriage Law is beneficial to women, it's so easy for women to get divorced!" "If the man is disabled after divorce, can the woman help him?" etc. It is necessary to solve these "whys" at the discussion meetings. Once these problems are solved and thoughts are clarified, the masses will have new demands: they admire the new family relationships and demand the establishment of new rules, so they raise more questions from the positive side. Such as "What is true love?" "What counts as equality?" "How to manage the household?" "How to hold family meetings?" and ask to make covenants. Therefore, it is necessary to solve the question of "how to do" at this time. Movement leaders must grasp this law, otherwise, even if the problems are solved, it is not deep enough and only has form.

The work group held a total of fifteen women's discussion meetings, twenty men's discussion meetings, three old women's discussion meetings, and two old men's discussion meetings in Mengkeli Village. In general: During the discussion meetings, the masses themselves solved and the work group helped solve: eleven pairs of discordant couples, eight pairs of discordant mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and one household of discordant sisters-in-law. Because the work group grasped the principle of adhering to education in its publicity, the masses were very kind to the work group, and some families who had resolved disputes wanted to invite the comrades of the work group to eat bean buns. Song Baoshan said with emotion, "In the past, it was said that it was difficult for honest officials to judge family affairs, but Chairman Mao has judged family affairs."

How can discussion meetings be held well? The experience of Mengkeli Village is:

(1) They must be convened after extensive publicity and the masses have initially grasped the spirit of the Marriage Law; the masses can distinguish right from wrong, the discussion meetings can be convened, and problems can be solved. (2) Talk as things come up, without being constrained by formality, so that the masses do not feel restrained and can fully express their inner thoughts.

(3) In the early stage, it is best to hold separate meetings for men and women, as they cannot talk together. After their thinking matures, they can be held together. When resolving marital estrangement and untying "knots," it is even more necessary to do a good job of preparation to prevent confrontation and deepening contradictions. (4) There must be backbones, rely on backbones to enliven the discussion meetings, and give the masses specific help as the movement deepens, otherwise the masses will feel "uneasy," which is especially important in the final stage of the movement. (5) Grasp the law of the masses' ideological development; when solving problems, guide them to discuss one by one from the shallow to the deep. (6) Resolutely prevent "pursuit" and "deduction," and absolutely do not mobilize the masses to accuse or use simple criticism methods that are crude and damage the self-esteem of the masses, as this will cause chaos and even create an atmosphere of terror.

    黑龙江贯彻婚姻法工作组在孟克里村进行试点工作
    坚持教育方针收到良好成绩
    黑龙江省贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室派出工作组在郭后旗孟克里村进行贯彻婚姻法运动的试点工作，始终坚持教育方针，使工作获得良好成绩。
    孟克里村是黑龙江省各项工作较好的一个村。两年多来在贯彻婚姻法方面也有成绩：包办、买卖婚姻基本上已告绝迹，青年男女社交公开，自由婚姻获得社会舆论的支持。但是，夫妇不和、婆媳不和的事情还相当普遍，即使在村干部中，也有不少人打老婆。
    工作组初到村时，村干部有三种反应：第一类干部（特别是妇女与青年干部）积极拥护这一运动，他们高兴地说：“这回跑到家门口来教办法，得好好学习，要不，过了这村就没这店啦！”第二类干部对运动抱规避态度，他们有的是打过老婆的，有的是在贯彻、执行婚姻法上有些毛病的，怕向群众检讨，怕受处分。第三类干部有厌烦情绪，对运动抱着消极态度，主要是怕影响生产，或是认为本村没有包办婚姻，“不用再贯彻了”。
    在群众中，大部分人对婚姻法表示拥护，特别是青年与妇女。但也有的心存顾虑，认识模糊。如：已经结婚的壮年人、夫妇感情较好的人，认为婚姻法与他们无关。某些老年人怕贯彻婚姻法后“乱了世道”，他们说：“过去高山遮不住太阳，男人说了算，现在平权了，老人说句话连屁都不当！”在男子中比较普遍地有男尊女卑思想，他们说：“是猫能避鼠，是男能作主，管不住老婆还行？”至于过去打过老婆的男子，给儿媳受过气的婆婆，听说工作组来了，都有些胆怯，怕离婚，怕受处分。有的男人赶快向老婆献殷勤，说：“以后甚么会你都去参加，孩子我来哄！”并且准备着“坦白”。但也有人在晚上偷偷地掐妻子，气冲冲地说：“我看哪，什么婚姻法不婚姻法，反正是叫打离婚！”
    工作组开展工作的第一个步骤是组织村干部学习。在学习中着重进行正面教育，反复地宣传贯彻婚姻法的目的、意义，这次运动的方针、作法。怕受处分的干部听了以后，说：“这回我像落了一块石头。”由于反复地宣传了运动的目的和意义，某些干部也纠正了把贯彻婚姻法与生产对立的错误看法。工作组并帮助村干部安排了各种工作，作了明确的分工，使各种工作很好地结合起来。在学习结束时，组织村干部总结学习收获，对照检查自己。最后又开了党的支部大会，许多干部检讨了封建思想，并展开了相互间的批评。
    干部学习后，即在群众中广泛地进行宣传、讲解婚姻法，召开了人民代表会、群众座谈会，演剧，举行小型展览会等等。经验证明：只要讲清贯彻婚姻法的目的是为了建立民主和睦团结生产的幸福家庭，群众的各种顾虑是会很快消除的，而且会涌现出大批积极分子。这些积极分子不光有青年，妇女，也有中年人，老年人。老刘太太过去怕儿女婚姻自主后不赡养她，现在她说：“他不养活我们老俩口子，政府也不能让啊，婚姻法上说得多明白！”
    孟克里村没有较严重的婚姻纠纷，但男人打老婆还是比较多的，包括一部分村干部在内。过去他们认为这是应该的；有的村干部在学习开始时，看见别人检讨打老婆，他也嘻皮笑脸地从炕上站起来，把屁股一摸，说道：“我也打了，你说她那个样子，不打怎么行！”对于这一问题，工作组以对事不对人的原则，指出这是旧社会遗留下来的坏行为，只有伪满的警察和地主才打人；在新社会，夫妇之间是平等的，谁有毛病都应帮助克服，打人是可耻的；这样可使群众认清男子打人是沾染了旧社会的恶习，使其痛恨旧社会与旧婚姻制度，以避免家庭矛盾的加深。干部中有打老婆的，经过学习后有了转变，便现身说法，在群众中以自己的事例进行宣传（如合作社主任李子周由打骂老婆变成有事和老婆商量），群众受到很大教育。
    孟克里村的试点工作中防止了急躁、粗暴的作法，宣传工作深入细致，又紧紧地结合当地实际例子，故收效甚为显著。如村干部杜清海打老婆的情况比较严重，工作组同志再三找他谈话，满腔热情，耐心说服，最后他感动地说：“我是个共产党员，这样教育我再不改，能配得上共产党员的称号吗！”
    经过普遍宣传婚姻法以后，群众会提出许多问题，因此进一步组织群众学习婚姻法，特别是开好群众的座谈会，是宣传教育中的重要一环。座谈会上启发大家向好的看齐。座谈会不能采取互相揭发批评的方式，以免形成家庭间、群众间的对立，形成斗争。
    座谈会开得好，不但统一了群众对若干问题的认识，一般家庭纠纷也都获得解决。萧景春是孟克里村有名的打老婆的，有点不如意的事，他就打，甚至老婆不生男孩子也打。经过座谈会和个别教育，他醒悟过来，沉痛地说：“我给地主扛了二十来年活，老是受地主的气；现在我不受气了，可是我欺压老婆。这太错误了。”现在他不但不打老婆了，还帮助老婆做饭，替老婆哄孩子，让她看剧去。多年和媳妇不和的姜老太太也认识了过去的毛病，使她的儿媳也感动地说：“我的小倔脾气也得改呀！”
    从群众座谈会中，初步摸到了群众思想发展的规律。如男子们开座谈会，初期多是从反面提出问题，如提“为什么自由结婚的还有离婚的？”“包办婚姻是不是都要离婚？”“妇女要求离婚，为啥要带财产？”“婚姻法对妇女有利，妇女要离婚多容易！”“男的残废，离婚后，女方也能扶助吗？”等问题。必须在座谈会上解决这些“为什么”。这些问题一经解决，思想得到澄清后，群众就会产生新的要求：他们羡慕新的家庭关系，要求建立新规矩，便多从正面提出问题了。如“什么样叫真正恋爱？”“怎样算平等？”“如何当家？”“家庭会怎样开？”又要求订公约。因之这时便要解决“怎样做”的问题。运动领导者必须掌握这种规律，不然，即令解决了问题，也不够深，徒具形式。
    工作组在孟克里村共召开了十五次妇女座谈会，二十次男子座谈会，三次老太太座谈会，二次老头座谈会。总的来讲：在座谈会期间，群众自行解决和工作组帮助给解决了的问题有：不和的夫妇十一对，不和的婆媳八对，妯娌不和的一户。由于工作组在宣传中掌握了坚持教育的方针，群众对工作组很亲热，解决了纠纷的家庭有的要请工作组的同志吃豆包。宋宝山感动地说：“过去说清官难断家务事，毛主席可把家务事给断了。”
    座谈会怎样才能开好呢？孟克里村的经验是：
    （一）必须在经过广泛宣传，群众初步掌握了婚姻法的精神以后召开；群众能够明辨是非，座谈会才能开得起来，才能解决问题。（二）随来随扯，不拘形式，使群众不感到拘束，尽情地倾吐心腹话。
    （三）初期最好男女分着开，合在一起谈不起来，待思想成熟后，可以联在一起开；在解决夫妻隔阂，解“疙瘩”时，更需要作好准备工作，以防止对立和加深矛盾。（四）要有骨干，依靠骨干活跃座谈会，和随着运动的深入，给群众以具体帮助，不然群众会感到“心没底”，特别在运动最后阶段，尤为重要。（五）掌握群众思想发展规律；解决问题时，由浅入深地引导他们一一讨论。（六）坚决防止“追”、“扣”，绝对不能发动群众控诉，也不能使用生硬的损伤群众自尊心的简单批评办法，那样会搞乱，甚至造成恐怖气氛。
