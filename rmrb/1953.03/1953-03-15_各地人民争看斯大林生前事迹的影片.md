    各地人民争看斯大林生前事迹的影片
    全国人民踊跃观看有关斯大林同志生前事迹的影片，学习斯大林同志一生为共产主义事业英勇斗争的精神。
    为了悼念斯大林同志，中国影片经理公司曾在三月八日急电全国各区公司，要求它们对各城市电影院及工矿区、农村放映队尽量供应有关斯大林同志生前事迹的十部影片：“宣誓”、“难忘的一九一九年”、“保卫察里津”、“斯大林格勒大血战”、“攻克柏林”、“第三次打击”、“列宁在一九一八年”、“列宁在十月”、“带枪的人”和“伟大的转折”，在三月十日到十六日上映。北京各电影院已从十日起上映北京电影制片厂摄制的“痛悼我们最敬爱的导师伟大的斯大林同志”的新闻影片特辑。
    各地人民都怀着最崇敬的心情，希望从银幕上再一次看到斯大林同志。放映以来，不论城市、工矿区、农村，观众都异常拥挤，仅北京市十六家电影院，截至十三日为止，观众已有十二万二千多人；天津市十六家电影院十、十一两日的观众共七万人，还有很多机关、团体已登记到十五日（星期日）的团体票；上海市放映这些影片的十家电影院，场场满座，仅十日到十二日，观众已达十一万二千多人，还有十三万二千多人买了十三日到十六日的影票。为了满足广大人民的要求，中国影片经理公司华东区公司上海办事处决定除原已排定的十家电影院外，还增加四家影院从十三日起放映这些影片。
    中国影片经理公司为了配合各地关于悼念斯大林同志的文件的学习，决定将各地放映日期延长到三月二十五日为止。　（新华社）
