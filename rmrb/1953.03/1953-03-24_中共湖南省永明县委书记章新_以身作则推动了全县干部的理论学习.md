Comrade Zhang Xin, Secretary of the Yongming County Committee of the CPC in Hunan Province, values theoretical study, delves into it deeply, and leads by example, promoting theoretical study among cadres throughout the county.

Comrade Zhang Xin regards theoretical study as one of his regular central tasks. After the higher Party committee assigned the study, he made proper arrangements for his daily work and study time, and drew up a study plan. He often said to the comrades of the County Committee: "If we want to do a good job in cadre study, we must first put in the effort to delve into it ourselves, and then we can provide specific leadership and improve our work." Since the start of the study of Malenkov's report, no matter how busy he was with work, he always took two or three hours every night to repeatedly and carefully read the documents and find reference materials. Often, when all the comrades in the County Committee had gone to sleep, he was still reading Malenkov's report. When he went to the countryside to inspect work, he also carried study documents with him, studying wherever he went. In addition, he also clipped the documents related to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union published in the newspapers and bound them into a study reference book to facilitate in-depth study. Many comrades, seeing his spirit of study, said: "Comrade Zhang Xin is getting more and more energetic as he studies, and he is worthy of everyone learning from him." As a result, two County Committee members also clipped the materials from the newspapers and bound them into study reference books. Party member and cadre Feng Qidi used to not value study, but now he was moved by his spirit of study and said with shame: "How can I be worthy of the Party if I don't study?" Therefore, he also actively insisted on studying every day.

Supervising and inspecting, and providing timely guidance, are the main methods Comrade Zhang Xin uses to help cadres conduct political and theoretical study. While inspecting work, Comrade Zhang Xin always combined it with inspecting the cadres' theoretical study. Once, when he was inspecting the central work in the fourth district of the county, he found that most of the cadres in the district had not studied well. He repeatedly explained the importance of study at the district cadre meeting, and stipulated that everyone must study for more than one hour a day without affecting the central work. Once, the Yongming County Committee held a meeting of district party secretaries, and Comrade Zhang Xin conducted oral tests on all the district party secretaries one by one, making those who had not studied well feel ashamed. From then on, everyone paid attention to study.

Zhang Xin also often paid attention to correcting the cadres' attitude towards study, requiring every comrade to deeply connect with reality in order to achieve the purpose of improving work. In addition, he also helped cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds to carry out cultural studies.

Due to the importance and practical responsibility of the County Committee leadership, the political and theoretical study of cadres throughout Yongming County has now been carried out very well.

    中共湖南省永明县委书记章新
    以身作则推动了全县干部的理论学习
    中共湖南省永明县县委书记章新同志重视理论学习，深入钻研，以身作则，推动了全县干部理论学习。
    章新同志把理论学习当作自己经常的中心工作之一。当上级党委布置学习以后，他把每天的工作时间与学习时间都作了妥当安排，订出学习计划。他经常对县委同志说：“要想搞好干部学习，首先我们自己就要下功夫钻进去，然后才能进行具体领导，才能提高工作。”从马林科夫报告学习开始后，无论工作任务多繁忙，他每夜总抽出二、三小时反复精读文件，找参考材料，常常在县委会所有同志都睡了，他一个人还读着马林科夫报告。下乡检查工作时也随身带着学习文件，走到那里，学到那里。另外，他还把报上登载的有关苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文件都剪下来，订成学习参考本，以便于深入钻研。许多同志看到他这种学习精神都说：“章新同志越学越有劲，值得大家向他学习。”于是有两个县委委员也把报纸上的材料剪下，订成学习参考本。党员干部封其弟过去一贯不重视学习，现在也为他的学习精神所感动，惭愧地说：“我不学习怎么对得起党呢？”因此每天也积极地坚持学习。
    督促检查，及时指导，是章新同志帮助干部进行政治理论学习的主要方法。在检查工作的同时，章新同志总要结合检查干部的理论学习。有一次，他在该县四区检查中心工作，发现该区大部分干部没有好好学习，他就在区干部会议上再三进行解释，强调学习的重要，并规定在不影响中心工作原则下每人每天必须学习一小时以上。有一次永明县委召开区委书记会议，章新同志对所有区委书记一个个进行口头测验，使没有好好学习的同志感到惭愧，从此大家对学习都重视起来。
    章新还经常注意端正干部的学习态度，要求每个同志深入联系实际，以达到改进工作的目的。此外，对工农出身的干部还帮助他们进行了文化学习。
    由于县委领导的重视和切实负责，永明县全县干部目前的政治理论学习已很好地开展起来。
