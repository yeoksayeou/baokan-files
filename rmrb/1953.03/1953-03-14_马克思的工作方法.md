    Marx's Working Methods
    German Democratic Republic, Gelasier
    The history of Marx's work "Das Kapital" is particularly educational. According to his own work habits, Marx wrote a series of larger works in the form of thematic papers before publishing his works, "for his own research, not for publication."
    When Marx began writing "Das Kapital," he wrote seven volumes of manuscripts, which would be almost fifty pages when printed. This was the first draft of "Critique of Political Economy," originally intended as the beginning of a large-scale study. Marx had been preparing for this work with extensive scientific research since 1843, but only began writing it in 1857.
      For each of his works, Marx collected a large amount of preparatory material—excerpts, outlines, charts, as well as all possible numbers, original material catalogs, etc.—organized and arranged it into a systematic content summary for easy selection in future work. For the same purpose, he also cataloged his own manuscripts.
    After five years of work—from 1843 to 1847, Marx had studied all the basic literature of economics and critically reorganized it. Do not forget that at that time Marx was also actively engaged in studying the documents and materials of the French Revolution, and did not relax his philosophical research. During this time, he also co-authored "The Holy Family" (or "Critique of Critical Critique") and "The German Ideology" with Engels.
    In 1847, Marx wrote "The Poverty of Philosophy," which was written against Proudhon's petty-bourgeois reactionary ideas, and at the same time it had already given us a materialist analysis of bourgeois economics. In the autumn of 1847, Marx gave a historic lecture entitled "Wage Labour and Capital." In the same year, Marx and Engels, commissioned by the "Communist League" they founded, drafted the famous "Communist Manifesto," which Stalin called the "hymn of Marxism." During the same period, Marx also wrote many papers for newspapers and the "Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher."
    This is an overview of the extensive work that Marx completed after starting the preparatory work for his major work, "Das Kapital."
                        ×××
    The scientific research method formulated by Marx requires fully grasping all the materials related to the issue before making general conclusions. Marx said: "Research must collect rich materials, analyze the various development forms of the materials, and explore the internal relations of these forms. Without first completing this work, there cannot be an appropriate description of the real movement."
    After fifteen years of studying and critically reorganizing the economic literature, Marx believed that the time was right to publish his work "Critique of Political Economy," which is a description of the first two chapters of the first volume of "Das Kapital." To prepare for the publication of these first two chapters, Marx excerpted more than two hundred pages of material from his reorganized vast amount of literature.
    After Marx fully and comprehensively grasped all the economic materials and completed the draft of the three volumes of "Das Kapital," he published the first volume of "Das Kapital," which was twenty-four years after he began writing it.
    Marx's family's sad material situation forced him to waste a lot of energy, dedicated to maintaining family life. In addition to this, we must also see how much great work Marx often did as the leader and organizer of the revolutionary party, and how arduous and unremitting struggle he carried out against various different petty-bourgeois hostile factions, which all required a lot of time and energy. This makes people feel that all the preparatory work for "Das Kapital" seems absolutely impossible to be done by one person. But Marx did it. According to incomplete statistics, he studied 1,500 books for "Das Kapital" and made summaries of them all.
                      ×××
    In order to master the read materials, Marx believed that making summaries was of particular importance, which can be seen from the fact that he also made summaries of his private collection of books. His method was to critically grasp the content of the books, examine the examples cited in them, and give them a rigorous analysis, for which purpose he often had to study mountains of statistical data. As Engels said, Marx never used any unchecked material, never quoted indirect sources, but always found its original source. Even minor dates, he had to find the original source, for which purpose he did not hesitate to make a special trip to the British Museum Library.
    Marx's exploration of anything must thoroughly pursue its historical roots and preconditions according to the requirements of dialectics. For example, when he wrote the section on land rent in the third volume of "Das Kapital," he specifically studied ancient history, agronomy, the agricultural conditions in Russia and the United States, geology, and other disciplines.
                      ×××
    Marx worked for ten hours a day in the British Museum Library. In his letter to Weidemeyer on June 27, 1851, he described the situation of this work as follows: "I am mostly in the British Museum from nine in the morning to seven in the evening. The materials I am studying are so terribly intertwined that even with all my strength, it is difficult to complete it before six to eight weeks, and there are often vulgar affairs that cannot be avoided in living in London. Regardless of all this, things are coming to an end. Those democratic ignoramuses, whose knowledge fell 'from the sky,' of course do not need such efforts. Why should these lucky ones trouble themselves with economic and historical data! The innocent Welysi often said to me, isn't all this very simple! Yes, everything is very simple! In this clumsy head. This is really a role that cannot be simpler."
    Marx bitingly mocked those who thought everything was easy and simple, the "roles that cannot be simpler," because they simply did not want to put in hard work. From this, we can see how great Marx's sense of responsibility for work was, and how high his demands on himself were. Marx fully possessed this characteristic, and he believed that this was indispensable for every scientific worker. In a letter to Engels, Marx also made the same severe satirical criticism of Lassalle, because Lassalle told Marx that he was going to "write a great work on national economy" and "prepare to spend two years." At that time, Marx wrote: "From my interpretation of money, he should see that either I know nothing about this matter, then I have ruined the entire history of the theory of money, or he himself is a stupid donkey, using some abstract words, such as 'abstract unity,' etc., to measure and judge things of practical experience, and these things must be studied, studied for a long time, before they can be discussed."
                        ×××
    Marx had an iron will, which increased his energy tenfold. Extremely heavy work damaged his health, coupled with difficult material circumstances, could not break his will and force him to stop working.
    From Marx's correspondence and the memoirs of his contemporaries, we can see how many unimaginable difficulties Marx encountered when writing "Das Kapital."
      After the first volume of "Das Kapital" was completed in 1867, Marx wrote a letter in response to Meyer's question of "why not reply to the letter":
    "Why didn't I reply to your letter! Because I have been hovering on the edge of the grave. So I had to use all my time to complete my writings, for which I have sacrificed my health, happiness, and family. I hope this explanation does not need to be added to. I laugh at those so-called 'practical' people and their cleverness. If a person is willing to be an ox, of course he can ignore the suffering of mankind and only care about his own grazing. But if I fall down and die without fully completing my book, at least completing the draft, I would really think I was 'impractical.'"
    Marx's entire activity was permeated with love for the oppressed people, which made him spare no self-sacrifice in the struggle to liberate mankind. Today, it is difficult for us to imagine the difficult circumstances that Marx experienced when creating "Das Kapital."
    In 1858, Marx said in a letter that his progress in economics was very slow, "because the main goal I have been studying for many years, just as I am about to conclude, new aspects always appear, and I need to reconsider. In addition to this, I am not the master of my time, but a slave of time. Only the night is my own time, and I often suffer from a liver disease that prevents me from working at night."
    The history of Marx's writing of "Das Kapital" is a heroic revolutionary struggle history, this struggle can complete any work and overcome all obstacles. Year after year, Marx always worked sleeplessly at night. In the correspondence between Marx and Engels, we can read: "In order to synthesize my economic research, I work like crazy all night..." (letter of December 8, 1857) "I work extremely diligently, often until four in the morning..." (letter of December 18, 1857).
    Because he worked too hard, he suffered from a serious illness. Marx wrote to Engels in 1858: "My night work... is too much." "In addition, I am making good progress. For example, I have completely overturned all past theories of profit. I accidentally revisited Hegel's logic, which is very helpful to me in the method of research."
    It should be noted here that Marx, regardless of his illness, regardless of his fatigue from working all night, revisited Hegel's logic, he still often reread the old books that he had repeatedly read and summarized, and each time he read them from a new perspective and gained new benefits from them.
                      ×××
    Marx strived for perfection in every work prepared for publication, whether it was its content, viewpoint, facts, inferences, as well as form, style, etc. He paid great attention to deliberating the style, and in order to make the narrative clear, simple, and popular, he often rewrote his manuscripts many times.
    In his letters to Marx, Engels often asked him how the writing of Das Kapital was progressing, and many times urged him to finish it quickly, advising him not to delay too long because of formal details. To Engels' question of how the progress of "Das Kapital" was, Marx once replied: "I will never print any part before the whole is completed... Even if defects are inevitable, I want to make it a complete work of art, which is the characteristic of this book. I will never print it before the whole is completed, this is my old method." (letter of 1856)

    马克思的工作方法
    德意志民主共和国　格拉塞尔
    马克思著作“资本论”的历史，特别具有教育意义。按照他自己的工作习惯，马克思在未发表他的著作之前，先以专题论文的形式写了一系列较大的作品，“为了自己研究，而不是为了付刊”。
    马克思开始著作“资本论”时，写了七卷稿本，印起来差不多要五十页。这就是“政治经济学批判”的初稿，原只是作大规模研究的开始。这本著作，马克思自一八四三年以来就已着手进行庞大的科学研究的准备工作，可是到一八五七年才开始写它。
      马克思对于他的每一种著作，都搜集大量的准备资料——摘录，提纲，图表，以及一切可能的数字、原始材料目录等等——加以整理，作成有系统的内容提要，以便在以后工作中易于选用。为了同一目的，他也把自己的稿本编出目录。
    经过五年的工作——从一八四三年到一八四七年，马克思已经研究了全部的经济学基本文献，批判地加以整理。不要忘记，当时马克思还正积极从事于研究法国革命的文件和资料，并且也没有放松他那哲学的研究。在这时候，他还和恩格斯合著了
    “神圣家族”（或“批判的批判的批判”）及“德意志意识形态”这两部书。
    一八四七年马克思写了“哲学的贫困”，这是针对蒲鲁东的小资产阶级反动观念而写的，同时它对资产阶级经济学也已经给我们作了唯物的分析。一八四七年秋，马克思作了以“雇佣劳动与资本”为题的历史性讲演。同年，马克思和恩格斯受他们所建立的“共产主义者同盟”委托，起草了著名的“共产党宣言”，斯大林称之为“马克思主义的圣诗”。在同一期间，马克思还为一些报纸以及“德法年鉴”写了很多论文。
    这就是马克思在开始他的主要著作“资本论”的准备工作以后，所完成的广泛的工作的概略。
                        ×××
    马克思制定的科学研究的工作方法，要求在作出 一般性的结论之前，先要充分掌握与该问题有关的
    一切资料。马克思说：“研究必须搜集丰富的材料，分析材料的种种发展形态，并探究这种种形态的内部关系。不先完成这种工作，则对于现实的运动，不能有适当的叙述。”
    经过十五年对经济学文献的研究和批判地整理后，马克思才认为到了适当的时机，可以发表他的著作“政治经济学批判”，这是“资本论”第一卷前两章的描述。为了准备这最前两章的出版，马克思从他那整理过的大量的文献里节录了二百页以上的资料。
    马克思在完整地、全面地掌握了所有经济学材料，并完成了三卷“资本论”草稿之后，才发表了
    “资本论”第一卷，这时离他开始著作时已二十四年了。
    马克思家庭的可悲的物质境遇，迫使他浪费了许多精力，专为维持家庭生活。除此而外，我们还要看看，马克思经常以革命政党的领袖及组织者的身分作了多么巨大的工作，他对于各种不同的小资产阶级的敌对流派，作了何等艰巨不懈的斗争，这都是需要大量的时间和精力的。这使人感到，“资本论”的全部准备工作凭一个人的力量似乎绝对不能做到。但是马克思竟然做到了。据很不完全的统计，他为了著“资本论”，曾钻研过一千五百种书，而且都作出提要。
                      ×××
    为了掌握读过的资料，马克思认为作提要有特别重大的意义，这一点，从他把自己的私人藏书也都作了提要可以看出来。他的方法是批判地掌握书籍的内容，检查其中所引证的事例，并给以严格的分析，为了这个目的往往还要研究堆集如山的统计资料。正如恩格斯所说，马克思从不用任何未经检查的材料，决不引用间接的根据，而总要找到它原来的出处。甚至次要的年月日，他也要查出原始根据，为了这个目的不惜费力专去一趟大不列颠博物院图书馆。
    马克思探研任何事物，都要按照辩证法的要求，彻底追求到它的历史根源及先决条件。例如当他写
    “资本论”第三卷土地地租一节的时候，他特别去研究上古史，农业学，俄国及美国的农业状况，地质学，以及其他的学科。
                      ×××
    马克思每天在大不列颠博物院图书馆里工作十小时。他在一八五一年六月二十七日写给卫特梅耶的信里，述说这种工作的情形如下：“我大半是从早晨九点钟到晚七点钟在大不列颠博物院里。我所研究的资料，是如此可恶地牵连太广，就是尽我全力也难以在六至八星期以前完成，其间还常有俗务纷扰，这是生活在伦敦所不能避免的。不管这一切的
    一切，事情是快要结束了。那些民主的无知之徒，他们的知识是‘从天上’掉下来的，当然不需要这样的努力。他们为甚么要向经济学的和历史的资料里自寻苦恼呢，这般幸运儿！那个天真的卫立西常对我说，这一切不都是很简单吗！是的，一切都很简单！在这个草包脑袋里。这真是不能更简单的角色。”
    马克思刺骨地嘲讽那些把一切认为容易、简单的“不能更简单的角色”，因为他们根本不想下苦功。由此可见，马克思对工作有怎样大的责任感，对自己的要求怎样高。马克思充分具备这种特性，他认为这是每个科学工作者所不可或缺的。马克思在写给恩格斯的一封信里，也曾经对于拉萨尔作了同样严酷的讽刺批评，因为拉萨尔告诉马克思说，他要“著一部伟大的国民经济著作”，“准备花两年的工夫”。当时马克思写道：“从我的货币阐释里他应该看出来，或是我对此事一无所知，那么，我给货币理论的全部历史造了孽，或是他自己是个蠢驴，对于实际经验的事物，用一些抽象词句，如
    ‘抽象的统一性’等等来衡量和判断，而这种事物是必须经过研究，长时间的研究，才能加以谈论的。”
                        ×××
    马克思具有钢铁般的意志，使他的精力增强十倍。极其沉重的工作损害了他的健康，加上物质上的困难境遇，都不能打破他的意志，迫使他停止工作。
    从马克思的书信往来里，从他的同时代人的回忆录里，可以看出来，马克思著“资本论”时遭遇了怎样不可想像的许多困难。
      一八六七年“资本论”第一卷写成之后，马克思写信答复梅耶的“为甚么不回信”的问题时说：
    “为什么没有给您回信吗！因为我一直徘徊在坟墓的边沿。所以我不能不利用一切时间，来完成我的著述，为了它，我已经牺牲了我的健康，幸福以及家庭。我希望这种解释用不着再加补充了。我笑那些所谓‘讲实际’的人和他们的聪明。如果人愿意作一头牛，当然他就可以不顾人类的苦难，而只去管它自己啃草。但是如果我一旦倒毙，而没有全部完成我的书，至少是完成草稿的话，我真要认为自己‘不实际’了。”
    马克思的全部活动都贯穿着对于被压迫人类的爱，这种爱，使他在解放人类的斗争里不惜任何自我牺牲。我们今天很难想像出，马克思在创作“资本论”的时候所经历的困难情况。
    一八五八年马克思在一封信里，说到他的经济学工作进度很慢，“因为多年来我主要研究的目标，正打算做结论时，总是又出现新的方面，又需要重新考虑。除此而外，又加上我不是我的时间的主人，而反成了时间的奴隶。只剩下夜晚是我自己的时间，并且还又常犯一种肝病，妨碍我夜里的工作。”
    马克思著“资本论”的历史，是英雄的革命性的奋斗历史，这种奋斗能完成任何工作，克服一切阻碍。长年累月，马克思总是彻夜不眠地工作。在马克思和恩格斯的来往信里可以读到：“为了综合我的经济学研究，我连夜疯狂似地工作……”（一八五七年十二月八日的信）“我异常勤奋地工作，常常到早晨四点钟……”（一八五七年十二月十八日的信）。
    因为他工作过度紧张，害了严重的病。马克思于
    一八五八年写信给恩格斯说：“我的夜间工作……太过分了。”“此外我得到很好的进展。例如一切过去的利润学说，我已经把它们完全推翻了。我偶然又重翻了一遍黑格尔的逻辑学，在研究的方法上，它对我很有助益。”
    这里需要注意的是，马克思不顾他的病，不顾他连夜工作的疲乏，又重翻了一遍黑格尔的逻辑学，他对于反复读过，并已做过提要的旧书，仍然还常再读一遍，每次都用新的观点去读，从其中获得新的益处。
                      ×××
    马克思对于每一种准备发表的作品，都极力求其完备，无论它的内容、观点、事实、推论以及形式、文体等，都是这样。他很注意推敲文体，为了叙述的明白、简单、通俗，他常常累次改写他的稿本。
    恩格斯在写给马克思的信里，常常问他资本论的著作进展如何，许多次催他快些结束，劝他不要为了形式上的细节耽搁太久。对于恩格斯所问“资本论”进展如何的问题，马克思有一次答复他说：“全体没有完成以前，我决不印行任何部分。……纵然难免缺陷，但我要使他成为一个完整的艺术品，这是我这本著作的特征。全体没有完成以前，决不印行，这是我原来就有的老办法。”（一八五六年的信）
