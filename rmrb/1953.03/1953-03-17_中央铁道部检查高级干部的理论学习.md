To reverse the past phenomenon of laxity and randomness in the study of senior cadres, and to strengthen ideological work and theoretical study within the organization, the Party Group of the Central Ministry of Railways has held several study meetings and study group leader meetings since late January to specifically examine study issues, giving the theoretical study of senior cadres a new look.

In February, six groups submitted study plans, and forty comrades submitted personal study plans. In these plans, many comrades examined their past study attitudes. For example, Mu Huan Kui, Director of the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Bureau, said: "Recently, I have examined the shortcomings and errors that have occurred in my work over the past five or six years, most of which were due to insufficient ideological and policy levels. I must persist in studying in the future." Chen Diwei, Director of the Publication and Review Department of the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways, said: "The serious shortcoming is that I have not studied the documents deeply enough and have not connected them with reality enough." Gao Mohua, Director of the Organization and Guidance Department of the Political Department, also examined his past erroneous attitude of "always thinking that work is too busy and there is no time, work must be done, and study can be postponed and perfunctorily." Because these comrades deeply examined their past erroneous attitudes towards study, their study plans were relatively well-made. Many comrades stated in their plans that they were determined to correct their study attitudes, strictly abide by study discipline, adhere to study time, and conduct self-examination regularly to cultivate study habits and consolidate the foundation for self-study. Lin Zi'an, Deputy Director of the Rolling Stock Bureau, is determined not to forget to study even when on business trips. Yu Chujie, Director of the People's Supervision Office of the Ministry of Railways, said: "If a business trip cannot avoid delaying study, I will also use the time to make up for the lessons to ensure that I do not miss any." Some comrades also decided to study a specific issue in the documents in depth in conjunction with their job duties. For example, Chen Diwei "decided to systematically study the issue of improving railway labor productivity and write it down in writing as a review of my participation in railway work for more than three years." Some comrades proposed in their plans to continue to carefully read the "Party" part of the Malenkov report three to five times. Chen Chunsen, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Political Department, stipulated that he would take two or three mornings a week to help all cadres of the Propaganda Department and cadres of the Ministry of Railways study. In short, the formulation of plans has improved everyone's enthusiasm for study and strengthened their confidence and determination in study.

At present, each group is carefully and carefully reading the documents. In order to do a good job in the next step of discussion and effectively connect with reality, the Mu Huan Kui group has specifically divided into three parts: industry, conservation, and the law of value, and designated central speakers to facilitate in-depth discussion.

In order to enable this study to continue to deepen and solve problems in connection with reality, the Party Group and the Propaganda Department of the Political Department will also hold study meetings in the future to conduct specific inspections.

    中央铁道部检查高级干部的理论学习
    中共中央铁道部党组，为了扭转过去高级干部学习中的散漫自流现象，加强机关内部的思想工作和理论学习，自一月下旬起，曾召开过几次学习会、学习组长会，具体检查学习问题，使高级干部的理论学习面貌为之一新。
    在二月份已有六个小组交了学习计划，四十个同志交了个人学习计划。在这些计划中，不少同志检查了过去的学习态度。如机车车辆制造局局长牟焕奎同志说：“最近我自己检查了五、六年来工作中所发生的缺点和错误，大半是由于思想、政策水平不高所致，今后必须坚持学习”。铁道部政治部出版审查部部长陈迪威同志说：“严重的缺点是文件钻研不深，联系实际不够。”政治部组织指导部部长高墨华同志也检查了过去“总是认为工作忙乱无时间，工作不做不行，学习可以推迟敷衍”的错误态度。由于这些同志深刻地检查了过去对学习的错误态度，所以他们的学习计划都做得比较好。许多同志在计划中都表示：要决心端正学习态度，严格遵守学习纪律，坚持学习时间，并经常进行自我检查，以培养学习习惯，巩固自学基础。车辆局副局长蔺子安决心出差也不忘掉学习。铁道部人民监察室主任喻楚杰同志说：“如出差不能不耽误，也要利用时间补课，保证不缺”。有的同志还决定就文件中的某一专门问题，结合自己的岗位工作加以深入钻研。如陈迪威同志“决定就提高铁路劳动生产率问题加以系统地研究，并用书面写出，以作为个人三年多来参加铁路工作的检查”。有些同志在计划中提出要继续把马林科夫报告“党”的部分精读三遍到五遍，政治部宣传部副部长陈春森同志规定每周抽出两三天早上帮助宣传部全体干部及铁道部机关干部学习。总之，通过制订计划提高了大家学习的情绪，坚定了学习的信心和决心。
    目前各组都在认真精读文件，为了搞好下一步的讨论，并有效地联系实际，牟焕奎小组特分工业、节约及价值法则等三个部分进行准备，并指定中心发言人，以便深入讨论。
    为了使这次学习能继续深入，并联系实际解决问题，今后党组及政治部宣传部还将再开学习会议进行具体检查。
