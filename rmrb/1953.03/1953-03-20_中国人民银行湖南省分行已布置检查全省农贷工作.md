    The Hunan Branch of the People's Bank of China Has Arranged to Inspect Agricultural Loan Work Throughout the Province

    A letter from the Hunan Branch of the People's Bank of China: The February 7th report published reader Lan Bo's letter regarding "Zou Changjie, a cadre of the Linxiang County People's Bank, blindly issuing water conservancy loans without investigation." According to the results of two investigations by personnel sent by the Linxiang branch, the situation is completely true. In addition to conveying and discussing the investigation results at a cadre meeting, the branch also notified the entire county to immediately inspect agricultural loan work. Comrade Zou Changjie has written a written self-criticism and received a demerit of major offense. Because this year's agricultural loan figures are very large, there are many new cadres who have joined the work, are unfamiliar with the business, and do not fully understand the spirit and methods of issuing agricultural loans, similar situations have occurred in other counties. In order to correct the deviations in a timely manner, our bank has arranged for inspections throughout the province in mid-February to eliminate the chaotic phenomena in agricultural loan work.

    中国人民银行湖南省分行已布置检查全省农贷工作
    中国人民银行湖南省分行来信：二月七日报上登载读者蓝波关于“临湘县人民银行干部邹常杰不经调查盲目发放水利贷款”的来信，据临湘支行两次派员检查结果，证明情况完全属实。该行除将检查结果在干部会议上传达和讨论外，并通报全县立即检查农贷工作。邹常杰同志已作了书面检讨，并受记大过一次的处分。因为今年的农贷数字很大，新参加工作的干部多，业务不熟，对发放农贷的精神和办法领会不够，类似情况其他县份亦有发生。为了及时纠正偏向，我行已于二月中旬布置全省进行检查，以肃清农贷工作中的混乱现象。
