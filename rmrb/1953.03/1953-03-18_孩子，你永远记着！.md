Child, Remember This Forever!
Shi Licheng

The martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to defend our homes and country will not only be perpetually mourned by the people of the motherland, but also by the people of Korea and the people of the world. Last year, during the Qingming Festival, Korean elder Li Taiji led his eleven-year-old grandson, Li Wenyu, to pay respects at the grave of Wang Shouyi, a martyr of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, to express his condolences. At the martyr's grave, this Korean elder recounted the following events to his grandson with deep sorrow. The author wrote this poem based on this event.

Put flowers in front of the grave,
Stick pine branches on the tomb's crest;
Child, you must always remember:
A hero rests in this grave.

This hero is called Wang Shouyi.
He came from the north bank of the Yalu River,
From Chairman Mao Zedong,
From the great New China.

It was a snowy dawn,
The whole village hid in the West Mountain cave;
Suddenly, American robbers appeared on all sides,
Staring at people with fierce eyes.

The robbers were beaten bloody at the Yalu River,
Throwing away guns and cannons, fleeing south.
The robbers drove the people south as they fled,
If you walked slowly, they'd kick or beat you.

The heavy snow covered the mountains and forests,
Tears rolled in the old man's eyes;
The heavy snow fell incessantly,
Children cried out for their fathers and mothers.

The north wind pierced through thin clothes,
The robbers beat everyone until they were injured;
The north wind made people shiver all over,
The robbers beat people to death on the road.

Your mother was sick and walked slowly,
The robbers beat her with leather whips;
How could her weak body withstand it,
Your dear mother died on Angry Wind Mountain.

Your mother held you tightly until her last breath,
Afraid that you would also be injured by the robbers;
Your mother called your name before she died,
Telling you to always remember this blood debt!

Your mother slowly told me before she died,
Telling me to raise you well;
When you grow up, be like your father,
Join the People's Army to defend our homeland.

The robbers kept driving people south,
Grandpa picked you up, my heart aching:
You lost your mother at such a young age,
I swallowed my tears.

The robbers became more and more ruthless,
Driving people to Kimchon County;
They set up machine guns in a square,
To kill all 500 of us in the village.

The Korean people are born strong,
The villagers sang "General Kim Il-sung's Song"
Standing tall in the square,
The heroic song frightened the robbers pale,
The heroic song shook the mountains of Korea.

The robbers' machine guns spewed fierce flames,
Villagers fell one after another...;
Grandpa held you tightly in my arms:
"Let them kill me, but they can't kill you!"

The robbers' machine guns were firing fiercely,
A burst of cannon fire came from the north,
Shouts echoed from all sides of the mountains,
The Chinese People's Volunteer Army arrived in Kimchon!

More than twenty warriors charged into the square,
Led by this hero;
The robbers panicked and lay down on the ground,
Wang Shouyi crawled forward.

Wang Shouyi charged into the square,
His left arm and right chest were seriously injured;
The robbers were still fiercely strafing the crowd,
The people's hero, ah, bravely pounced on the robbers' machine guns.

Wang Shouyi strode forward,
Raising his right hand and throwing a grenade;
Three robbers were blown to pieces,
The rest dropped their machine guns and fled south.

Wang Shouyi chased after the enemy,
Suddenly staggered and fell to the ground;
The villagers rushed to help him up,
Wang Shouyi, ah, had already rested forever...

More than twenty warriors also charged into the square,
Wiping out the fleeing robbers;
You and Grandpa were saved,
And saw the bright sun again!

More than fifty villagers who escaped from the disaster,
With tears in their eyes, lifted Wang Shouyi's body:
These tears were not because of the disaster,
These tears were to mourn a dear person.

Carry the martyr back to our hometown,
The tomb is chosen on this Green Peak Mountain;
In spring, this place is full of blooming flowers,
In autumn, this place is full of fragrant rice ears.

Child, ah!
The mountains are full of flowers blooming every year,
The hero's name will be passed down for generations;
The fields are full of rice that we plant generation after generation,
Sons and grandsons, never forget the hero!

    孩子，你永远记着！

    在抗美援朝保家卫国斗争中牺牲的烈士，不仅会受到祖国人民永久的悼念，而且会受到朝鲜人民和世界人民永久的悼念。去年清明节时，朝鲜老人李泰吉领着他十一岁的孙儿李文玉给中国人民志愿军的烈士——王守义上坟，表示哀悼。在烈士坟前，这位朝鲜老人对他的孙儿沉痛地述说了下面这些事。作者根据这件事写成了这首诗。把鲜花摆在坟前，将松枝插在墓顶；孩子，你永远记着：这墓里安息着的，是一位英雄。这位英雄叫王守义。他来自鸭绿江北岸，来自毛泽东主席那里，来自伟大的新中国。是一个大雪纷飞的黎明，全村人躲避在西山洞；突然间四面出现了美国强盗，对人们瞪着凶恶的眼睛。强盗们在鸭绿江畔碰的头破血流，扔枪丢炮向南逃走。强盗在逃跑时把人们向南赶，走慢了，不是踢呀就是揍。满天的大雪盖山林，老人的眼里泪珠儿滚；满天的大雪纷纷下，孩子们哭喊着爸爸、妈妈。北风吹透了薄衣裳，强盗打得人人带伤；北风吹的人浑身打颤，强盗把人打死在大路边。你妈妈有病走的慢，强盗打她用的皮鞭；瘦弱的身体怎么抵得住呀，你亲爱的妈妈死在怒风山。你妈妈临死还紧紧地抱着你，怕你也被强盗打伤；你妈妈临死叫着你的名字，叫你永远记着这笔血账！你妈妈临死慢慢地对我讲，叫我好好地把你抚养；长大了要和你爸爸一样，参加人民军保卫家乡。强盗还把人们向南赶，爷爷抱起你心如刀剜：你小小的年纪就失去了母亲，我的眼泪往肚子里咽。强盗作恶越作越狠，把人们赶到了金川郡；在一个广场上架起了机枪，要杀害咱全村五百多人。朝鲜人民生来就坚强，乡亲们唱着“金日成将军之歌”屹立在广场上，壮烈的歌声吓得强盗面色青黄，壮烈的歌声震撼了朝鲜的山岗。强盗的机枪吐出了凶恶的火舌，乡亲们倒下了一个、又一个……；爷爷把你紧紧搂在怀里：
  “叫他们打死我，可不能打死你！”强盗的机枪正在打的凶，北面传来了一阵阵的炮声，四面山岗上一片呐喊，中国人民志愿军赶到了金川！二十多个勇士向广场冲锋，领头的就是这位英雄；强盗们惊慌地卧倒在地，王守义匍匐着身子向前冲。王守义冲进了广场，左臂和右胸都负了重伤；强盗们还在凶恶地向人群扫射，人民的英雄呵，奋勇扑向强盗的机枪。王守义大步扑向前，高举右手打出一颗手榴弹；三个强盗被炸的血肉横飞，其余的丢下机枪向南逃窜。王守义向着敌人追击，突然倾斜了一下身子栽倒在地；乡亲们赶上去把他扶起，王守义呵，已经永远安息……。二十多个勇士也冲进了广场，把逃窜的强盗消灭精光；你和爷爷这才得到了活命，抬头又看到了灿烂的太阳！脱难的五十多位乡亲，眼含着泪花抬起王守义的尸身：这泪花不是因为受了灾难，这泪花是为了哀悼亲爱的人。把烈士抬到咱的家乡，坟地选在这青峰山上；春天这地方满山鲜花开放，秋季这地方遍地稻穗喷香。孩子呵！满山的鲜花年年开，英雄的名字传万代；遍地的稻子咱辈辈种，子子孙孙不要忘了英雄！（附图片）
