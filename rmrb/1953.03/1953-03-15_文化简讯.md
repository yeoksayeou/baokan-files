　　Northwest Organizes Traditional Chinese Veterinary Doctors to Participate in Patriotic Livestock Protection Movement
　　Various places in Northwest China have organized traditional Chinese veterinary doctors to participate in the patriotic livestock protection movement. In the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai alone, more than 5,000 traditional Chinese veterinary doctors were organized last year. Among them, 2,000 traditional Chinese veterinary doctors were organized in 64 counties including Yulin, Wuqi, and Hengshan in Shaanxi Province. They have played a good role in the patriotic livestock protection movement.
　　Last year, in accordance with the policy of "uniting and educating traditional Chinese veterinary doctors," various places opened livestock and veterinary training courses to conduct political education and impart advanced medical technologies to traditional Chinese veterinary doctors. Subsequently, various places launched traditional Chinese veterinary doctors to participate in local mass patriotic livestock protection movements, and established "Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine Associations" or "Traditional Chinese Veterinary Joint Clinics." Currently, Shaanxi Province has organized more than 100 "Traditional Chinese Veterinary Joint Clinics." After the traditional Chinese veterinary doctors were organized, they adopted methods such as "watching the trough and protecting the trough" and "zoning and contracting" to conduct regular livestock health checks, and often guide farmers and herdsmen to improve livestock feeding management. Traditional Chinese veterinary doctors in Yulin, Changwu, Hu County, Fengxiang and other counties in Shaanxi Province mobilized local farmers and herdsmen to organize more than 260 patriotic livestock protection groups, actively improving livestock feeding methods and barn hygiene. Last year, during the wheat harvest, Ma Yaoxian, a traditional Chinese veterinary doctor in Sanyuan County, led traditional Chinese veterinary doctors throughout the county to inspect more than 11,300 livestock and specifically guided farmers and herdsmen to improve livestock feeding management, so that the livestock were very healthy during the summer harvest.

    南京市在春季爱国卫生突击运动中全面开展挖掘蝇蛹工作，成绩很好。据不完全的统计，现在南京全市参加挖蛹的共有三万多人，挖到蝇蛹六千六百余斤。
      西北组织中兽医参加爱国保畜运动
    西北各地组织中兽医参加爱国保畜运动。仅陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海四省去年就组织中兽医五千多名，其中陕西省榆林、吴旗、横山等六十四个县就组织中兽医两千多名，他们在爱国保畜运动中起了良好的作用。
    去年，西北各地依据“团结教育中兽医”的政策，纷纷开办畜牧兽医训练班，对中兽医进行政治教育和传授先进的医疗技术。随后各地便发动中兽医参加当地群众性的爱国保畜运动，成立“中兽医协会”或“中兽医联合诊疗所”。现在，陕西省已组织起“中兽医联合诊疗所”一百多个。中兽医组织起来后，采用“看槽保槽”、“分区包干”等办法，定期进行牲畜健康检查，并经常指导农民、牧民改善牲畜的饲养管理。陕西省榆林、长武、鄠县、凤翔等县的中兽医，动员当地农民、牧民组织二百六十多个爱国保畜小组，积极改善牲畜的饲养方法和圈棚的卫生。去年麦收时，三原县中兽医马耀先带动全县中兽医巡回检查一万一千三百多头牲畜，并具体指导农民、牧民改善牲畜的饲养管理，使牲畜在夏收期间都很健康。
