Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 4th: The following is a TASS dispatch from Moscow on March 4th regarding Comrade J.V. Stalin's health condition at 2:00 AM on March 4, 1953:

On the night of March 1, 1953, Comrade J.V. Stalin suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. This illness affected important parts of his brain, resulting in paralysis of his right leg and right arm, as well as loss of consciousness and the ability to speak. On March 2nd and 3rd, various corresponding treatments were administered to improve impaired respiratory function and blood circulation. However, to date, these treatments have not resulted in significant changes in his condition. At 2:00 AM on March 4th, Comrade J.V. Stalin's health condition remained serious. Breathing was severely impaired: a respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, with uneven breathing patterns and prolonged periodic intervals. The pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, with a highly irregular heartbeat; blood pressure was at a maximum of 220 and a minimum of 120. The body temperature was 38.2 degrees Celsius. Due to impaired respiration and blood circulation, there was a lack of oxygen. The degree of impairment of brain function had increased somewhat.

Currently, several treatments aimed at restoring the body's most vital functions are being administered.

    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日电：关于约·维·斯大林一九五三年三月四日上午二时健康情况的公报如下：
    一九五三年三月一日夜晚，约·维·斯大林突然患脑溢血症，这种疾病影响了他的脑子的重要部分，因此形成了右腿和右臂的麻痹，并使他失去了知觉和说话的能力。三月二日和三日施行了各种相应的治疗，来改进已受障碍的呼吸机能和血液循环，然而到目前为止，这些治疗还没有使病情有重大的转变。三月四日上午二时，约·维·斯大林的健康情况仍然严重。呼吸受到很大的障碍：呼吸次数每分钟三十六次，呼吸节律不均匀，有周期性的长时间的间歇。脉搏频率每分钟一百二十次，心律非常不齐；血压最高二百二十，最低一百二十。体温是摄氏三十八点二度。由于呼吸和血液循环受到障碍，氧气缺乏。大脑机能受障碍的程度有些增加。
    目前正在施行若干旨在恢复身体极其重要的机能的治疗。
