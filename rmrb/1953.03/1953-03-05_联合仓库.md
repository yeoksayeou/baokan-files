    "Joint Warehouse"
    Nan Yuqing
    Under the guidance of Soviet expert and former locomotive depot chief, Comrade Balenov, the materials warehouse work of the Changchun Locomotive Depot has undergone a major reform: establishing close ties between material warehouses in various locations, supporting each other, and helping each other, forming a vast and rich "joint warehouse." This has completely changed the past state of material work. Material supply is now flexible and timely, downtime due to lack of materials has been almost eliminated, working capital has been reduced compared to the past, and the turnover rate of funds is much faster than before. In short, according to them, "From now on, we will no longer be dominated by materials, but we will dominate materials." This new working method of the Changchun Locomotive Depot provides an important method for compressing working capital, which is a very meaningful reform in material work.
    The Changchun Locomotive Depot experienced a tortuous process in implementing this new method.
    Two years ago, the inventory material quota of the Changchun Locomotive Depot was 1.37 billion yuan, with seven warehouses, twenty-nine warehouse keepers, and six people in charge of the general ledger of materials, making it a rather large organization. Everyone was working with cards all day long, but the physical items and the cards never matched. The monthly material budget took two people half a month to prepare. Warehouse keepers often worked overtime, and had to come on Sundays to move materials. Materials were piled up like mountains in the seven warehouses, but still could not meet the needs of production in a timely manner, and downtime due to lack of materials continued to occur.
    Not long after the establishment of the China Changchun Railway Administration, the depot implemented an economic accounting system, returning obsolete, waste, and surplus materials to the material factory, leaving one warehouse and eight warehouse keepers, and compressing material funds to 174 million yuan, an eightfold reduction compared to the past. Of course, the vehicle repair task did not decrease, remaining at six or seventy vehicles per month. As a result, downtime due to lack of materials became even more serious. Material Director Zhang Baowen said, "I don't think I can do it! The material funds are not enough for supply, what can I do with so little money!" He thought that the only reason why the work was not done well was that the material funds were too small. Everyone also lacked confidence and had low morale.
    At this time, Soviet expert and locomotive depot chief, Comrade Balenov, came to the material warehouse. He said kindly to Comrade Zhang Baowen, "Comrade, do you think that you cannot meet the supply because of a lack of funds? That is not the case! If you do not improve the management methods and continue to use that old method of managing materials—receiving, issuing, and storing—with the warehouse keepers becoming mere watchers of the piles, then even if you are given 2 billion yuan in funds, you will not be able to meet the needs of production." He added, "How can we do a good job in material supply? Each section of the railway has material warehouses, and transportation is convenient, so we can unite with each section to adjust and use materials mutually. As long as everyone can establish an overall concept of serving production in their minds!"
    After listening to Balenov's words, Comrade Zhang Baowen was determined to do so, and began to actively contact material personnel from various sections.
    Initially, material personnel from various sections were unwilling to adjust and use materials with each other. However, after the persuasion and education of Locomotive Depot Chief Comrade Balenov, and Zhang Baowen's frequent and proactive introductions of his own inventory material situation to the material directors of various sections, everyone knew the inventory situation of each other, making it easy to exchange and use materials. After everyone understood the benefits of exchanging and using materials with each other, the material warehouses of each section gradually formed an integrated "joint warehouse." Whoever was short of what materials only needed to make a phone call, and the materials would be brought along by the nearest train. For example, locomotive number 冖ㄎ—一一三七 had been undergoing a major inspection for two days, and it was discovered that there was a problem with the generator. Repairing the generator required insulating oil, but the crew had not specified the material, and the warehouse did not have any in stock. The warehouse keeper contacted the Harbin Material General Factory, but the General Factory also did not have this kind of oil. The material clerk ran to more than twenty electrical material stores on the street, but still could not buy any. Just then, Director Yang of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot material department called and said that he had sent two kilograms of insulating oil along with train number 569, and asked them to pick it up at the station.
    Later, the Changchun Locomotive Depot material group not only formed a "joint warehouse" with various locomotive depots, but also gradually expanded this joint warehouse, successively uniting with the Changchun Electrical Section, the Works Section, the Rolling Stock Section and other warehouses. In this way, many materials and parts needed for maintenance projects were promptly resolved.
    Zhang Baowen, the material director of the Changchun Locomotive Depot, told me, "The 'joint warehouse' method is too wonderful. By implementing this method, we are actually equivalent to having seven or eight material warehouses. Since implementing the joint warehouse, we have not had a single instance of downtime due to lack of materials!" He added, "We are able to complete the state's tasks with a small amount of funds, mainly because we have established an overall concept and a view of serving production."
    Material costs account for 20 percent of the Changchun Locomotive Depot's overall production and financial plan. Because they implemented the new management method of the joint warehouse, the material fund turnover rate was reduced from an average of 30 days (before the implementation of economic accounting) to 9 days. With much less funds than in the past, they supplied the huge needs for maintenance and engineering materials, saving the state a large amount of funds.

    “联合仓库”
    南玉庆
    长春机务段的材料仓库工作，在苏联专家、前机务段长巴列诺夫同志的指导下，实行了一个重大的改革：在各地的材料库之间建立亲密联系，相互支援，相互帮助，形成一个庞大而丰富的“联合仓库”。这就使得材料工作完全改变了过去的状况，材料的供应灵活及时了，停工待料的事件几乎消灭了，流动资金比过去减少了，而资金的周转率却比过去快得多了。总之，按照他们的说法是：“从今起，我们不再被材料所支配，而变成我们支配材料了。”长春机务段这一新工作方法提供了一个压缩流动资金的重要方法，这是材料工作上的一个极有意义的改革。
    长春机务段实行这个新方法曾经历了一段曲折的过程。
    两年前，长春机务段库存材料定额是人民币十三亿七千万元，有七个仓库，二十九名管库员，六个人管材料总帐，机构相当大。大家整天对卡片，而现品和卡片总是不符。每月的材料预算，两个人就得做半个月。管库员经常加班加点，星期天还得来搬运材料。七个仓库里材料堆积如山，但仍不能及时地供应生产的需要，停工待料现象仍不断发生。
    中长铁路管理局成立不久，该段实行经济核算制，把呆料、废料、多余料返回了材料厂，剩下了一个仓库和八名管库员，材料资金压缩到一亿七千四百万元，比过去减少了八倍。当然，车辆检修任务并没有减少，每月仍是六、七十台车，于是，停工待料现象更加严重。材料主任张宝文说：“我算干不了！材料费不够供应，这点钱好干啥！”他以为工作做不好的唯一原因就是材料费太少。大家也都没有信心，情绪不高。
    这时，苏联专家、机务段长巴列诺夫同志来到材料库，他对张宝文同志亲切地说：“同志，你以为资金少就不能满足供应吗？不是的！如果不改善管理方法，还用那一套陈旧的管理材料的方法——收、发、保管，管库员成为看堆的，那么，再给你二十亿元资金，也满足不了生产需要。”他又说：“怎样才能做好材料供应工作呢？铁路上各段都有材料仓库，交通又便利，可以和各段联合起来互相调剂使用。只要大家能在思想上树立起为生产服务的整体观念！”
    张宝文同志听了巴列诺夫的话以后，决心这样做，便开始主动和各段材料人员联系。
    最初，各段的材料人员都不肯彼此调剂使用材料。但经过机务段长巴列诺夫同志的说服教育，同时张宝文也经常把自己库存材料情况主动介绍给各段材料主任，使得彼此知道各库存料情况，好串换使用。当大家都知道互相串换的好处后，各段的材料仓库就渐渐地形成了一个整体的“联合仓库”，谁缺什么材料，只要一个电话打过去，材料便随着最近的列车捎来了。如冖ㄎ—一一三七号机车甲检两天了，发现发电机有毛病，修理发电机需要用绝缘油，乘务员没有定料，库里又没有存料。管库员就向哈尔滨材料总厂联系，总厂也没有这种油。材料员到街上跑了二十来家电料行也没买到。就在这时，苏家屯机务段材料部门的杨主任打来了电话，说随五六九次列车给捎来二公斤绝缘油，叫他们到车站去拿。
    以后，长春机务段材料组不但和各机务段形成了一个“联合仓库”，并把这个联合仓库逐渐扩大，先后和长春电务段、工务段、车辆段等仓库也联合起来了，这样就使得很多检修工程上要用的材料、零件都及时地得到了解决。
    长春机务段材料主任张宝文对我说：“联合仓库这个办法太妙啦，实行了这个办法，我们实际上等于有了七、八个材料库，从实行联合仓库以来，我们还没有发生过一次停工待料的事哩！”他又说：“我们能够以少数的资金完成国家任务，主要是树立了整体观念和为生产服务的观点。”
    长春机务段材料费占全段生产财务计划百分之二十。由于他们实行了联合仓库的新管理方法；使得材料资金周转平均由三十天（实行经济核算前）降到九天，以比过去少得多的资金，供应了检修、工程材料的庞大需要，给国家节省了大批资金。
