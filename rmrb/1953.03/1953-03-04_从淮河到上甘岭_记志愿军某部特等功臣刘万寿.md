From the Huai River to Triangle Hill
—An Account of Special-Class Merit Citation Recipient Liu Wanshou of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
Gong Tieshan

　　On November 11, 1952, the battle of Triangle Hill was raging fiercely. When the 1st Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army counterattacked Height 537.7, Liu Wanshou, a soldier of the 6th Squad and a member of the Communist Youth League, stepped forward bravely and destroyed two enemy firing points in succession, enabling the troops to successfully occupy the position. After the battle, Liu Wanshou was awarded a special-class merit citation. His heroic deeds spread throughout the entire unit.

　　Liu Wanshou is a twenty-year-old lad with broad shoulders, a chubby face, and a pair of rough, large hands like cattail leaf fans, full of strength. A year ago, he was still a hardworking farmer. His family lived in Sangyuan Village, Yingshang County, Anhui Province, with five people in his family: his parents and three younger brothers. The village was located between the Huai River and the Sha River and was flooded every year. His father worked as a hired hand for landlords for thirty years, and the family often went hungry, relying entirely on fishing, shrimp catching, and digging for wild grass to survive their bitter lives.

　　In 1948, sixteen-year-old Liu Wanshou almost drowned in the flood. That year, the Huai River swelled, and Liu Wanshou was captured by the Kuomintang bandit army to block the breach. He was draped in a torn sack, shivering in the heavy rain. Before him was the horrifying flood, under his feet was the paper-thin riverbank, and behind him were the Kuomintang bandit soldiers with loaded guns. He looked left and right, and the poor people who had been captured were all pale, each one as if entering a slaughterhouse. The flood eroded the yellow earth on the dike, layer by layer, and it was about to breach. Liu Wanshou threw away the torn sack and turned to run, and some people ran with him. The Kuomintang bandit soldiers desperately shouted and beat the fleeing masses. Suddenly, the riverbank breached, and Liu Wanshou escaped with his life on a high slope; those who ran slowly were drowned.

　　After liberation, the Communist Party brought happiness to the people of the Huai River basin. Chairman Mao issued the call to "be sure to harness the Huai River well," and hundreds of thousands of working people participated in this great Huai River control project. Liu Wanshou also became a construction worker. At the construction site, gongs and drums were sounding, red flags were fluttering, and the people who loved the Huai River worked selflessly. Liu Wanshou carried baskets of earth, one after another, barefoot, and his shoulders were swollen. When others filled his basket with earth, he would still say, "Fill it more, fill it more." Liu Wanshou thought to himself: the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang that was weighing on our heads has been defeated, and if we fix the Huai River, we can live a good life. The more he thought about it, the happier he became, and he worked with extra vigor.

　　Not far away, a sluice gate was being built. Dredgers and tractors worked day and night, and the huge steel frames grew in number. The red flags on the riverbank also rose rapidly, and the dike became higher and higher. Liu Wanshou stared at this giant object like a rainbow as if he were bewitched, sometimes without blinking for several minutes. He loved it as much as he loved his own life.

　　When the Korean-Chinese People's Forces were victoriously conducting the Fifth Campaign on the Korean battlefield, the Huai River levee was also rapidly completed. Liu Wanshou thought: The levee is complete, but the war is threatening it. Every basket of soil and every stone that makes up this levee is a part of his life. Without the levee, the people of the Huai River basin would not have peace. Without the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting on the front lines, nothing is reliable.

　　In the early summer of 1951, Liu Wanshou signed up to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. At the grand farewell meeting in his hometown, he wore a big red flower on his chest and expressed his determination in front of the villagers: "In order to defend the Huai River and defend our good life, we must resolutely defeat the American wolves!"

　　In October, Liu Wanshou arrived at the Korean front and was assigned to the 1st Company of a certain unit. He heard many stories of heroic deeds and combat experience from the soldiers every day, and he felt that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was truly a heroic force, and he wanted to strive for merit and become a hero. He practiced his skills day and night, actively requested to participate in combat, and trained himself. During "fortification" work, he swung the eight-jin heavy sledgehammer tirelessly. When his comrades were tired, he would talk about the Huai River to encourage everyone. He always said: "Digging one more shovel is equivalent to eliminating one more American devil, and our motherland's peaceful construction will be even more guaranteed."

　　Last November, a fierce battle for the heights on the left flank of Triangle Hill was underway. Van Fleet had already lost nearly 20,000 men, but he still wanted to occupy this high ground to cover his shame. On the 11th, Liu Wanshou's company counterattacked this hilltop.

　　At exactly 4:00 PM, our artillery fire began a rapid barrage, and flames engulfed the entire hilltop. In half an hour, the assault team would attack. At this time, the battalion had an urgent order that had to be delivered to instructor Kang Lanyun before the assault. However, the instructor was at that moment leading the assault team in the forward tunnel. Reaching the tunnel required crossing over a thousand meters of restricted area that was tightly sealed off by enemy artillery fire, and it was almost entirely flat ground. This task fell on the shoulders of squad leader and Communist Party member Li Shengyong and Liu Wanshou. After receiving the task, both of them expressed to the battalion leaders that they would resolutely complete the mission. Liu Wanshou said, "I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I must deliver the order."

　　The two of them jumped out of the tunnel and rolled into the shell craters. The enemy's machine guns followed, and clumps of gray earth spun around them; the artillery fire also intensified. Li Shengyong and Liu Wanshou skillfully rushed through this area, reached the tunnel, and delivered the order to the instructor.

　　According to the orders from higher authorities, the instructor led the assault team to attack the hilltop fiercely, but they were blocked about twenty meters from the hilltop. Two enemy firing points still remained on the hilltop, and the flames from the enemy's machine guns could sweep both the front and sides simultaneously, causing the attack to be thwarted.

　　The sound of artillery and grenade explosions on the right flank gradually moved forward, which was a signal of victory for the right flank assault team. But the enemy here became frenzied, and several enemies even showed themselves to throw grenades. Liu Wanshou couldn't bear it any longer. He knew that the decisive moment for the battle victory had arrived, and at this time he should play an exemplary role as a member of the Communist Youth League.

　　Liu Wanshou said to the platoon deputy, "I'll go eliminate them!" He picked up an explosive pack and climbed up. He avoided the machine gun bullets sweeping at him and crawled close to the enemy's firing point close to the ground. Taking advantage of the moment when the enemy was changing machine gun magazines, he knelt up with a "whoosh" and aimed his submachine gun at the firing port for a burst, and the enemy's light machine gun never spoke again. But the enemy's heavy machine gun was still firing madly, and the gunpowder smoke sprayed into Liu Wanshou's face. Before the enemy's heavy machine gun could turn its muzzle, Liu Wanshou sent another explosive pack into it. With a loud bang, six more enemies were finished.

　　The road to victory was opened, and the assault team successfully occupied the hilltop. Continuous explosions were heard from the gully in front, which was our artillery fire pursuing the remaining enemies.

　　At this time, the sky was full of stars, and a gentle breeze dispersed the smoke on the battlefield after the fierce battle. Liu Wanshou looked at the hilltop, illuminated red by the artillery fire, and suddenly felt that the red flag on the Huai River levee had been planted on the Triangle Hill position.

    从淮河到上甘岭
    ——记志愿军某部特等功臣刘万寿
    宫铁山
    一九五二年十一月十一日，上甘岭战斗激烈地进行着。当志愿军某部一连反击五三七点七高地的时候，六班战士、青年团员刘万寿挺身而出，连续炸毁了敌人两个火力点，使部队胜利地占领了阵地。战斗结束后，刘万寿光荣地被记特等功一次。他的英勇事迹传遍了整个部队。
    刘万寿是一个二十岁的小伙子，宽宽的肩膀，胖胖的脸，一双粗而大的手像蒲扇一样，浑身充满着力气。一年前他还是个勤劳的农民。他家住在安徽颍上县桑园村，家里有五口人：父母亲和三个弟弟。村子在淮河与沙河之间，年年被淹。他父亲给地主当了三十年长工，家里经常饿肚子，全靠打鱼捞虾拔野草过苦日子。
    一九四八年，十六岁的刘万寿差点儿给淹死在洪水里。那一年淮河涨大水，刘万寿被国民党匪军抓去堵口，他披着破麻袋，在大雨中冻得直发抖。面前是骇人的洪水，脚底下是纸薄的河堤，后面是荷枪实弹的国民党匪军。他左右看了看，抓来的穷人都面无人色，一个个像进了杀场一样。洪水冲蚀着堤上的黄土，一层层地脱落下去，眼看就要决口了，刘万寿扔掉破麻袋，扭头就跑，有的人也跟他跑起来。国民党匪兵们拼命地吆喝，打骂逃跑的群众。忽然，河堤破口了，刘万寿跑在一个高坡上逃出了命，跑慢的都被淹死了。
    解放后，共产党给淮河流域的人民带来了幸福，毛主席发出了“一定要把淮河修好”的号召，成千上万的劳动人民参加了这个伟大的治淮工程。刘万寿也当了民工。在工地上，锣鼓喧天，红旗招展，热爱淮河的人们忘我地劳动着。刘万寿赤着脚，一大筐一大筐地挑土，肩膀压肿了。别人给他装土时，他还是说：“多装些，多装些。”刘万寿心里想：压在头上的蒋匪帮给打垮了，修好淮河可以过好日子了。他越想越高兴，干起活来就特别起劲。
    不远的地方正在修水闸。挖泥船、拖拉机日夜地干活，巨大的钢架越来越多。河堤上的红旗也迅速的上升，堤越升越高了。刘万寿像发痴似的看着这个像虹一样的巨物，有时几分钟都不眨眼，他热爱它，像热爱自己的生命一样。
    当朝鲜战场上朝中人民部队正胜利进行五次战役的时候，淮河大堤也迅速地完工了。刘万寿想：河堤是完成了，可是战争却在威胁着它。筑成这座大堤的每一筐土每一块石头都是他生命的一部分，没有大堤淮河流域的人民就不得安宁。没有志愿军在前线作战，一切也靠不住。
    一九五一年初夏，刘万寿报名参加了志愿军，在家乡的盛大的欢送会上，他胸前戴着大红花，在乡亲们的面前表示了决心：“为了保卫淮河、保卫好日子，要坚决打败美国狼！”
    十月间，刘万寿来到朝鲜前线，被编在某部一连里。他每天都听到很多的战士们的英勇事迹和战斗经验，他感到志愿军真是英雄部队，自己要争取立功当英雄。他不分昼夜地练习技术，积极地要求参加战斗，锻炼自己。在“筑城”中他抡着八斤重的大铁锤不歇气地干。在同志们疲劳的时候，他就谈起淮河来鼓舞大家。他总是这样说：“多挖一铲，就是多消灭一个美国鬼子，咱们祖国的和平建设就更有了保障。”
    去年十一月间，上甘岭左侧高地上进行着炽烈的争夺战。范佛里特已经损失了将近两万人，可是他还想占据这个高地来遮羞。十一日，刘万寿这个连对这座山头进行了反击。
    下午四时正，我军炮火开始急袭，火光包围了整个山头，再有半个钟头突击队就要攻击了。这时，营里有一件紧急命令，要在冲锋前送到指导员康兰云那里去。可是指导员这时正带着突击队在前面坑道里。到坑道去要经过敌人炮火严密封锁的一千多公尺的封锁区，这里又几乎全是平地。这个任务落在班长、共产党员李胜勇和刘万寿的肩上，他们两人接到任务后，都向营首长表示坚决完成任务。刘万寿说：“我是青年团员，一定要把命令送到。”
    他两人跳出坑道就滚入炮弹坑，敌人的机枪随着射过来了，一团团的灰土花就在他两人身边旋转；排炮也打紧了。李胜勇和刘万寿巧妙地冲过了这个地区，到达坑道里，把命令交给了指导员。
    指导员按照上级的命令，率领突击队向山头猛攻，但是在离山头二十多公尺的地方却受到了阻拦。山顶上还残存着敌人的两个火力点，敌人机枪吐出的火舌能同时向正面和两侧扫射，攻击受到了顿挫。
    右翼的炮声和手榴弹爆炸声逐渐前移，这是右翼突击队的胜利信号。但是这里的敌人却疯狂起来，有几个敌人还露出身来扔手榴弹。刘万寿耐不住了，他知道战斗胜利的决定时刻来到了，这时候他应该起一个青年团员的模范作用。
    刘万寿向排附说：“我去消灭它！”他拿起爆破筒就爬了上去。他避开了从身上扫过来的机枪子弹，紧贴着地面爬近敌人的火力点，趁着敌人换机枪梭子的瞬间，“呼”的一声跪起来，端起冲锋枪朝着射口就是一梭子，敌人的轻机枪就再也不啃气了。但是旁边的敌重机枪仍在疯狂射击，火药的硝烟喷到刘万寿的面前。刘万寿在敌人的重机枪枪口还未转过方向的时候，又把一根爆破筒送了进去，一声巨响，六个敌人又完了蛋。
    胜利的道路打开了，突击队顺利地占领了山头。前边山沟里传出连续的爆炸声，这是我军炮火在追击残敌。
    这时，满天繁星，微风吹散了激战后的战场上的烟雾。刘万寿看着被炮火照耀得通红的山头，他忽然觉得：淮河大堤上的红旗插到上甘岭阵地上了。
