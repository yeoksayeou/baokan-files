The Third Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building dispatched a work team in February to inspect the capital construction preparations of its affiliated Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, Taiyuan Machine Plant, Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant, Northeast Machinery Plant No. 2, No. 17, No. 20, and No. 25, and found that most units were not doing a good job in their preparations.

Based on the situation of eleven factories, the status of capital construction preparations can be roughly divided into three categories:

The first category includes factories such as Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant, and Northeast Machinery Plant No. 25. The leading cadres of these factories attach importance to capital construction work, actively allocate cadres, strengthen and improve organizations, and reserve materials needed for construction. Although the project task book has not been finally approved, they have proactively solved various difficulties in the preparatory work before construction and have signed construction contracts or agreements with construction units. For example, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant has prepared more than 30% of the civil engineering materials, has allocated 87 technical personnel in civil engineering, including 23 engineers, and has reached more than 80% of the total annual labor requirements. The construction of the factory building has been contracted with the construction unit. Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant has a full-time factory director in charge of capital construction work and has allocated 19 technicians and 164 management cadres. More than 30% of the materials have been prepared, and a construction agreement for outsourced projects has been signed with the construction unit.

The second category of factory leaders does not pay enough attention to capital construction work and has varying degrees of waiting and reliance mentality. Therefore, there are insufficient cadres, incomplete organizations, and slow progress in preparatory work. For example, the leading cadres of Northeast Machinery Plant No. 2, Northeast Machinery Plant No. 20, Lanzhou Machine Plant, Guizhou Machine Plant, and Daxi Machine Plant believe that their construction tasks are not significant enough to warrant attention, or they believe that the tasks are too heavy for their factories to complete and can only rely on higher authorities, failing to take active measures to overcome difficulties. Northeast Machinery Plant No. 2 has a heavy installation task, but due to the lack of attention from the leading cadres, the capital construction department still lacks cadres who are primarily responsible. Northeast Machinery Plant No. 20 originally had three section-level cadres in charge of capital construction, but all were transferred this year.

The third category of factories is waiting because the higher-level leading authorities have not yet finalized the engineering tasks, and the preparatory work has not yet started or has just begun. For example, Northeast Machinery Plant No. 17 only established a special agency in late January. The factory director believes that "this year's task is small, the engineering outsourcing contract has been signed, the materials are the responsibility of Party B, and there is nothing significant." Therefore, the allocated cadres are of low caliber, and the head of the planning section of the capital construction department does not even know what a project task book is.

Regardless of the type of factory, the following problems are relatively common in terms of construction preparation:

1.  Geological surveys and soil analyses have not been concluded. For example, the geological survey work for the iron casting workshop and metalworking workshop of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, as well as the new factory buildings of Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant and Northeast Machinery Plant No. 17, have not been completed, and some have not even started.

2.  Construction plans are incomplete, and some units do not even have them. Among the eleven construction units, only Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant and Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant have prepared civil engineering construction plans; none have prepared mechanical and electrical installation plans.

3.  Technical operating procedures and technical safety regulations have only been formulated in part by Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, and the other factories have not started to formulate them.

4.  Insufficient material preparation. The national controlled materials required for the first quarter have been applied for allocation in a unified manner. Only Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant, Northeast Machinery Plant No. 25, and Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant have been actively pursuing materials balanced within the region. However, even for these factories, due to poor planning or design, the main materials are still poorly prepared. For example, the new factory building of Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant did not consider pile driving for the foundation in the original plan and did not apply for the allocation of timber for pile driving. It has now been found that there is sand four meters deep underground, and piles must be driven, requiring more than 1,600 cubic meters of timber, but this cannot be resolved at present. Also, according to the plan, the factory must store 4,000 tons of steel, but so far, not only are the main specifications of steel not available, but the amount stored is less than half of the planned amount.

5.  Poor equipment supply and management. Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant has only ordered 46% of the planned domestic equipment, and only 28.2% has been transported to the factory; only 47.5% of the planned foreign equipment has been ordered, and only 25.5% has been transported to the factory. Northeast Machinery Plant No. 25 has only ordered 29.5% of the planned domestic equipment and 38.8% of the foreign equipment. The situation at Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant is even worse. The factories have also failed to establish sound equipment management systems. For example, the equipment transported to Fushun Electrical Machinery Plant last year was placed haphazardly in the yard, and some of it has already rusted.

From the above situation, only the dormitory projects of the eleven construction units can be carried out according to plan. The factory building projects and mechanical engineering projects mostly cannot start on schedule. In order to ensure the realization of this year's construction plan, the Bureau requires all factories to immediately carry out the following work: 1. Announce the project items to the workers, mobilize the workers to find the key to completing the plan and methods, and overcome the mentality of waiting and relying. 2. Mobilize and organize cadres to discuss the various problems that have been discovered, determine solutions, designate responsible persons, and specify progress. 3. Separate the capital construction organization and finance from the production department; appoint a factory director or deputy factory director specifically responsible for capital construction. 4. Re-compile the construction plan based on the revised project task book of the First Ministry of Machine Building.

    第一机械工业部第三机械工业管理局所属各工厂
    基本建设施工准备工作做得不好
    中央第一机械工业部第三机械工业管理局，于二月间派出工作组，检查所属太原重型机器厂，太原机器厂，抚顺机电厂，东北机械二厂、十七厂、二十厂、二十五厂等工厂的基本建设准备工作，发现大部分单位的施工准备工作都做得不好。
    根据十一个工厂的情况来看，施工准备工作的情况大致可分三类：
    第一类工厂如太原重型机器厂、抚顺机电厂和东北机械二十五厂，这些工厂的领导干部重视基本建设工作，积极配备干部，充实与健全机构，储备施工所需要的材料，虽然计划任务书还没有最后批准，但都主动地解决了施工前准备工作中的各种困难，已与施工单位订立施工合同或协议书。如太原重型机器厂，土木建筑材料已准备了百分之三十以上，土木建筑方面的技术人员已配备了八十七人，其中包括工程师二十三人，劳动力配备已达全年总需要额的百分之八十以上；厂房部分的施工已和施工单位签订合同。抚顺机电厂有专职厂长负责基本建设工作，并配备了技术员十九名、管理干部一百六十四人，材料已准备了百分之三十以上，和施工单位签订了外包工程施工协议书。
    第二类工厂的领导干部还不重视基本建设工作，有着不同程度的等待、依赖思想，因此干部配备不足，机构不健全，准备工作进展得很慢。如东北机械二厂、东北机械二十厂、兰州机器厂、贵州机器厂、大鑫机器厂等厂的领导干部，认为自己的建设任务不大不予重视，或者认为任务很重自己厂无法完成，只能依赖上级，不采取积极的办法去克服困难。东北机械二厂的安装任务很重，由于领导干部不重视，到现在基本建设部门还缺少负主要责任的干部。东北机械二十厂原来有三名科长级干部负责基本建设，今年全被调走了。
    第三类工厂，由于上级领导机关还没有最后确定工程任务，领导干部在等待，准备工作还没有进行，或者刚刚开始。如东北机械十七厂，一月下旬才建立专责机构，厂长认为“今年任务少，工程外包合同已订好，材料都是乙方的事，没有什么大事了”。所以配备的干部水平很低，基本建设科计划股股长甚至于连计划任务书是什么也不知道。
    不管是那一类的工厂，在施工准备工作方面目前都比较普遍地存在着下面几个问题：
    一、地质勘测和土壤分析未得出结论。如太原重型机器厂的铸铁车间、金工车间，抚顺机电厂和东北机械十七厂的新建厂房的地质勘测工作都没有结束，有的还未进行。
    二、施工计划不完整，有的单位还没有。在十一个施工单位中，已经编制土木建筑施工计划的只有太原重型机器厂和抚顺机电厂；已经编制机电安装计划的一个也没有。
    三、技术操作规程和技术保安规程，除太原重型机器厂已经制订好一部分外，其他各厂都没有着手制订。
    四、材料准备不足。各厂第一季度计划需要的国家控制物资，已统一申请调拨。由地区平衡的物资，只有抚顺机电厂、东北机械二十五厂和太原重型机器厂抓得比较紧。但即使是这些工厂，也由于计划或设计不周等原因，主要的材料还准备得很差。如抚顺机电厂新建厂房因原计划没有考虑到基础工程要打桩，没有申请调拨打桩用的木材，现在发现地下四公尺深的地方有泥沙，非打椿不可，需要一千六百余立方公尺的木材，但是目前没法解决。又如按计划该厂必须储备四千吨钢材，但到现在，不仅主要规格的钢材没有，而且储备的数量还不及计划数量的二分之一。
    五、设备供应差，管理不好。太原重型机器厂已订到的国内设备只达计划的百分之四十六，已运到厂的只达百分之二十八点二；已订国外设备只达计划的百分之四十七点五，已运到厂的只达二十五点五。东北机械二十五厂已订到的国内设备只达计划的百分之二十九点五，国外设备只达百分之三十八点八。抚顺机电厂的情况更差。各厂也没有建立健全的设备管理制度。如抚顺机电厂去年运到的设备，零乱地放在院子里，有的已经生锈。
    从以上的情况来看，十一个建设单位，只有宿舍工程可以按计划施工，厂房工程和机械工程大部分都不能按期开工。为了保证今年的建设计划的实现，该局要求各厂立即进行下列工作：一、向职工宣布工程项目，发动职工寻找完成计划的关键和办法，克服等待依赖思想。二、发动和组织干部讨论已发现的各种问题，确定解决的办法，指定专人负责，规定进度。三、把基本建设的机构和财务与生产部门分开；指定专门负责基本建设的厂长或副厂长。四、根据第一机械工业部修正的计划任务书重新编制施工计划。
