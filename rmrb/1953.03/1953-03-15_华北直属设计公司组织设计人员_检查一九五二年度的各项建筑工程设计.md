The North China Directly Subordinate Design Company organized design personnel to go deep into construction sites to inspect the designs of various architectural engineering projects in 1952. During the inspection, each inspection team invited the original clients and current users to hold discussions and solicit their opinions on the engineering designs. After specific inspections, they found that most engineering designs had many serious shortcomings. These shortcomings are specifically manifested in:

    I. Some designers demonstrated the exploitative views brought from the old society in their engineering designs. For example, when designing the North China Regional Tax Bureau Building, some designers clearly knew that the construction area of the site was small and did not meet the requirements of urban construction. However, in order to cater to the client's one-sided requirements, they tried their best to squeeze the buildings together in the design. Some engineering drawings designed by some designers were either not completely drawn or even drawn incorrectly, such as forgetting to draw the gate in the design of the fence; some drawings were unclear or did not have any captions at all; some knew that installing electric bells in oil depots was prone to fire, but they still designed it on the drawings simply because the client requested it.

    II. The phenomenon of blindly designing without thorough investigation and research is still very common in some construction projects. For example, when constructing an office building for a certain government agency, the designer responsible for designing this project did not conduct a serious engineering geological survey, so he proceeded with the design. As a result, it was not until after the excavation of the trench that it was discovered that the soil pressure was insufficient, and the foundation had to be enlarged and the ground beam had to be re-installed, which affected the progress of the project.

    III. Many designers still lack the concept of economic accounting in engineering design. For example, some designers, in designing a certain national defense project, used the old method to design the sheathing, which originally only required 1.8 cm thick wood, into 2 cm thick wood. As a result, this small project wasted more than 37 million yuan.

After this inspection, many designers clearly realized the harm of bourgeois design thinking to national basic construction and have made great progress in practical design. For example, the designers who are designing the 5201 project, after criticizing the erroneous design of a similar project last year, assured each other that they would not repeat previous mistakes. Some designers have proposed to re-examine the completed engineering projects. Some designers have also begun to apply the advanced Soviet design standards in their designs. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北直属设计公司组织设计人员
    检查一九五二年度的各项建筑工程设计
    华北直属设计公司组织设计人员深入工地，检查了一九五二年度各项建筑工程的设计。在检查中，各个检查小组都邀请了原委托者和现在的使用人座谈，征求他们对工程设计的意见。经过具体检查，他们发现大部分工程设计都存在着许多严重的缺点。这些缺点具体表现在：
    一、某些设计人员，在工程设计中表现了从旧社会带来的雇佣观点。如设计华北区税务管理局大楼时，有些设计人员明明知道工地建筑面积狭小，不符合市政建设的要求。但他们为了迎合委托者的片面要求，就在设计中想尽办法使建筑物挤在一起。有些设计人员所设计出来的工程图纸，有的没有画完全，甚至画错了，如设计围墙忘了画大门；有的图纸交代不清或根本没有写图说；有的明知油库安装电铃容易发生火灾，只是因为委托者的要求，就照样设计在图纸上。
    二、在某些建筑工程中，不经过周密的调查研究就盲目设计的现象还很普遍。如建筑某机关的办公大楼时，负责设计这一工程的设计人员，没有认真地进行工程地质勘察，就进行了设计，结果开工刨槽后才发现土压不够，不得不加大墙基和重打地梁，影响了工程的进度。
    三、许多设计人员，在进行工程设计中还缺乏经济核算的观点。如有的设计人员在设计某一国防工程中，按老一套的方法，把本来只需要一点八公分厚木材的望板，设计成二公分厚的木材。结果使这个小小的工程就浪费了三千七百多万元。
    经过这次检查，许多设计人员都明确地认识到资产阶级设计思想对于国家基本建设的危害性，并在实际的设计中有了很大的进步。如正在设计五二○一工程的设计人员，在批判了去年一个性质相同的工程的错误设计后，相互保证不再重犯以前的错误。有些设计人员提出把设计完毕的工程项目，拿出来再重新审查一下。有些设计人员并已开始在设计中运用苏联先进的设计标准。（新华社）
