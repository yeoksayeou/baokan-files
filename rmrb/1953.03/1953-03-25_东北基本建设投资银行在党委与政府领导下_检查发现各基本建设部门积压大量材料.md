The phenomenon of material stockpiling in various basic construction departments in Northeast China is very serious. According to the order issued by the former Northeast People's Government in December 1952 for the year-end clearance of leftover basic construction materials, the Northeast Basic Construction Investment Bank, under the leadership of local Party committees and People's Governments, investigated the year-end leftover materials of 306 basic construction units belonging to the state-owned industry, agriculture, forestry, trade, finance, highway, inland navigation, and postal and telecommunications systems in Northeast China. It was found that the value of materials stockpiled by various basic construction units in 1952 reached 1266.6 billion yuan. (This does not include the stockpiling of machinery and equipment, which is also very serious.) These stockpiled materials are mostly important materials such as steel, electrical, plumbing, fiber, and mining kiln materials. The value of these five important materials alone reached 1054.9 billion yuan, accounting for 83.28% of the total stockpiled value. The units with the most serious material stockpiling include the Fushun 301 Factory, accounting for 32.65% of the civil construction funds allocated last year, and the Harbin Flax Factory, accounting for 26.03% of the civil construction funds allocated last year. Among the stockpiled materials, more than 400 billion yuan worth of materials cannot be used this year.

The reason why this serious phenomenon of material stockpiling occurs is mainly because many basic construction departments have the idea of supply system, blindly purchasing materials, and neglecting material management. Leading cadres of the Fushun 301 Factory believe that "as long as the progress of the project is guaranteed and financial discipline is not violated, it is fine." In order to simply ensure the progress of the project, they store a large amount of materials, regardless of whether these materials are needed or not. Some units, fearing that the materials are not enough, blindly purchase materials under the guidance of the idea of "being prepared for a rainy day, and being generous rather than stingy." The financial departments also do not inspect and supervise the purchase of materials, and pay the material costs in batches. The basic construction material supply plans of many units are inaccurate. Some units do not even have material supply plans. The Basic Construction Investment Bank also contributed to the development of this phenomenon by not strictly supervising when allocating funds. Some basic construction units take the materials and amortize them into the cost, but do not ask whether the materials have been used. There are many remaining materials at the site, but no one recovers them. According to the statistics of 134 units, the value of these off-the-books materials totals 34 billion yuan. The value of off-the-books materials of the North Manchuria Engineering Department of the Northeast Electrical Industry Administration Bureau reached 1.4 billion yuan. The value of off-the-books steel materials of the Jilin Electric Power Bureau is 700 million yuan. Some cadres in the materials department are irresponsible and do not take good care of the materials. The Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Company lost 101 tons of cement due to poor material management. Some units also experienced material shortages. The Yichun Forestry Industry Administration Bureau was short of 3,098 cubic meters of wood. Individual production departments also used materials from basic construction departments. The Yangjia Zhangzi Mining Bureau used 670 tons of cement, 48 tons of angle iron, and two electric motors from the basic construction department.

Currently, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee is actively preparing to allocate the existing stockpiled materials in conjunction with the Northeast Basic Construction Investment Bank and will formulate measures to strengthen material management.

    东北基本建设投资银行在党委与政府领导下
    检查发现各基本建设部门积压大量材料
    东北各基本建设部门积压材料的现象十分严重。根据一九五二年十二月原东北人民政府颁布的年终清理基本建设结存材料的命令，东北区基本建设投资银行在各地党委与人民政府领导下，清查了东北国营工业、农业、林业、贸易、财政、公路、内航、邮电等系统所属的三百零六个基本建设单位年终结存的材料，发现一九五二年各基本建设单位积压材料的价值竟达一万二千六百六十六亿元。（这里还不包括机械设备的积压，而机械设备积压的现象也是很严重的。）这些积压的材料多是钢铁、电气、水暖、纤维、矿窑等重要材料，这五种重要材料积压的价值就达一万零五百四十九亿元，占积压总值的百分之八十三点二八。积压材料最严重的单位如抚顺三○一厂，占去年拨入土木建筑资金的百分之三十二点六五，哈尔滨亚麻厂占去年拨入土木建筑资金的百分之二十六点零三。在积压的材料中，有四千多亿元的材料今年也不能用。
    这种严重地积压材料的现象所以发生，主要是因为许多基本建设部门有着供给制思想，盲目采购材料，忽视材料管理工作。抚顺三○一厂领导干部认为：“只要保证了工程进度，不违反财政纪律就可以了。”为了单纯地保证工程的进度，他们大量地储备材料，却不问这些材料是否都需要。有些单位生怕材料不够用，在“有备无患，宽打窄用”的思想支配下，盲目采购材料。财务部门也不检查和监督采购材料的情况，就成批地把材料费支付出去。许多单位的基本建设材料供应计划是不准确的。有些单位甚至没有材料供应计划。基本建设投资银行在拨款时不严格监督，也助长了这种现象的发展。有些基本建设单位领了材料，就摊入成本内，但不问这些材料是否用了。现场内剩余了很多材料，也没有人收回。根据一百三十四个单位的统计，这种帐外材料的价值共有三百四十亿元。东北电器工业管理局北满工程处帐外材料的价值竟达十四亿元。吉林电业局帐外的钢铁材料价值七亿元。有些材料部门的干部不负责任，不很好地保管材料。黑龙江省粮食公司因保管材料不善，损失水泥一百零一吨。有些单位还发生短缺材料的现象。伊春森林工业管理局短缺了三千零九十八立方公尺的木材。个别生产部门还动用基本建设部门的材料，杨家杖子矿务局就曾动用了基本建设部门的水泥六百七十吨、三角铁四十八吨和电动机两台。
    目前东北财政经济委员会正协同东北区基本建设投资银行积极准备调配现有的积压材料，并将拟定加强材料管理工作的措施。
