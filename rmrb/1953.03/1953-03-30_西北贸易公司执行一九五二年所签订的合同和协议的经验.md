    The Northwest Trading Company, in order to develop the exchange of local products and promote the market within the region, organized cooperatives and private industrial and commercial enterprises in the Northwest region to participate in more than twenty material exchange meetings both inside and outside the region in 1952. Based on the business principles of being realistic, having both buying and selling, and mutual benefit and assistance, it signed 1,226 purchase and sales contracts and agreements, including 1,847 kinds of commodities, with a total value of 135.3 billion yuan. Last year, a total of 1,049 contracts and agreements were executed, including 1,562 kinds of commodities, with a total value of 96 billion yuan. Calculated by the total number of contracts and agreements, over 85% was completed, and calculated by the total transaction value, over 70% was completed. The company made great efforts in the execution of contracts and agreements and gained four points of experience: 1. Attaching importance to contracts and agreements, recognizing the seriousness and legality of contracts and agreements, and establishing a new work style of abiding by policies, implementing systems, and being realistic. Before signing contracts, most of the representatives attending the exchange meetings were able to consider various aspects to avoid blind and chaotic signing. For some commodities that were not sure about or not well understood, the method of signing contracts in small batches was adopted. When signing the contract, the content of the contract, especially the specifications, quality, delivery location, and expense burden, were stipulated in detail and clearly. 2. When encountering the other party not seriously executing the contract or delaying with excuses, immediate criticism was made, and the other party's direct superiors were requested to supervise, which can play a positive role in promoting contract performance. 3. After the representatives sent out signed the contracts and agreements, they should report to the Northwest Trading Company in a timely manner. After receiving the report, the company immediately purchased in the production area, centralized transportation, so that the contract was performed on schedule. 4. Strengthening internal and external contacts, in terms of purchasing, actively reminding the other party to deliver on schedule; in terms of sales, if the supply of goods is sufficient, actively contacting the other party to strive for early delivery, in order to accelerate capital turnover and timely supply to the market.
    A portion of the purchase and sales contracts or agreements signed by the Northwest Trading Company in 1952 have not yet been completed. There are five reasons for this: 1. When signing the contracts and agreements, there was insufficient understanding of the commodity production season and specifications and quality. For example, a contract for selling 50,000 jin of ephedra was signed at the Sichuan West Exchange Meeting, stipulating delivery in August. However, the ephedra in the Northwest region will not be available in large quantities until September, so only 30,000 jin were delivered. 2. Insufficient foresight on the development and changes of the market. After the "Five-Anti" campaign, the demand for goods in the market surged, and many commodities were in short supply, but the Northwest Trading Company's estimate of this was very poor. For example, 150,000 jin of Lanzhou melon seeds were sold at the Central South Exchange Meeting for delivery in August. This commodity was originally a slow-moving commodity, but after the commodity exchange at the Northwest Trading Company's manager joint meeting and vigorous promotion in Xi'an city, most of it was sold out. When the contract was sent, there was no goods to deliver, and it had to be postponed. 3. Individual units do not act in accordance with the contract. For example, in August, September, and October of 1952, goods worth about 2 billion yuan were sent to brother companies in the Northeast region according to the contract, but no remittance has been received so far, affecting the capital turnover of the Northwest Trading Company, so the goods due for delivery in October of last year were not sent. 4. Accidents occurred in transportation, affecting the delayed execution of the contract. For example, in July of last year, due to the collapse of Tianbao Road, the angelica produced in Minxian and the licorice produced in Wuwei could not be transported out in time. 5. The other party signing the contract simply pursues figures. For example, 50,000 bolts of Zhenping homespun cloth from Henan Trading Company were ordered at the North China Exchange Meeting. When signing, it was felt that the number was a bit large, and it was originally intended to purchase less, but after listening to the representative of Henan Province Trading Company say that there was a large backlog in Henan Province and the peasants were eager to sell, in order to solve the difficulties of friendly regions, it was signed. Unexpectedly, only 18,570 bolts were sent by the delivery date (August of last year), and only 30,715 bolts have been executed so far, accounting for 61.43% of the should be executed.

    西北贸易公司执行一九五二年所签订的合同和协议的经验
    方承杰
    西北贸易公司为了发展土产交流，繁荣区内市场，在一九五二年先后组织西北区的合作社和私营工商业，参加了区外、区内二十多个物资交流会，本着实事求是、有买有卖、互利互助的业务方针，以现货现款、期货期款，以货易货等方式，签订购销合同和协议共一千二百二十六份，包括一千八百四十七种商品，总值一千三百五十三亿元。去年共执行了合同和协议一千零四十九份，包括一千五百六十二种商品，总值九百六十亿元。按合同和协议的总件数计算，完成了百分之八十五强，按成交总值计算，完成了百分之七十强。该公司在执行合同协议中曾尽了很大努力，并取得了四点经验：一、重视合同协议，认识合同协议的严肃性与法律性，树立遵守政策、执行制度、实事求是的新作风，出席交流会的代表，在未签订合同以前，多数能够多方考虑，避免盲目乱订的现象。对一些无把握或不够了解的商品，则采取分批小宗签订合同的办法。在签订合同时，对合同的内容，特别是对规格、质量、交货地点、费用负担，都规定得很详细、明确。二、遇到对方不认真执行合同，或藉词拖延的情况，立即提出批评，并函请对方直接上级，予以督促，这对合同履行能起积极推动作用。三、派出的代表在签订合同协议后，要及时向西北贸易公司报告，公司得到报告后，立即在产区收购，集中调运，使合同按期履行。四、加强内外联系，在购货方面，主动提醒对方按期交货；在销货方面，如果货源充足，主动与对方联系，争取提前交货，以便加速资金周转，及时供应市场。
    西北贸易公司一九五二年所签订的购销合同或协议，还有一部分没有完成，其原因有五：一、在签订合同协议时，对商品生产季节及规格质量了解不够。如在川西交流会上订了销售五万斤麻黄的合同，规定八月交货。但西北区的麻黄，要到九月间才能大量上市，因而只交付了三万斤。二、对市场发展变化的情况预见性不足。“五反”后市场需货量激增，很多商品供不应求，但西北贸易公司对这一点估计很差。如在中南区交流会上售出的八月份交货的兰州瓜子十五万斤，这种商品原是滞销商品，但经过西北贸易公司经理联席会议上的商品交流，和在西安市内大力推销而大部售完。待合同寄来，无货可交，不得不延期执行。三、个别单位不按合同办事。例如一九五二年八、九、十月按合同发往东北区兄弟公司约值二十多亿元的货物，至今未见汇款来，影响西北贸易公司资金的周转，所以在去年十月应交合同货，就未予发往。四、运输上发生事故，影响合同延期执行。如去年七月间由于天宝路塌方，使得岷县出产的当归、武威出产的甘草，不能及时运出。五、签订合同的对方，单纯追求数字。如在华北区交流会上订购河南贸易公司镇平土布五万匹，当签订时，即感到数字大了些，本拟少购进，但听了河南省贸易公司代表说河南省内积压数量很大，农民求售迫切，为了解决友区困难，就签订下来了，未料截至交货期（去年八月份）仅发来一万八千五百七十匹，到现在只执行三万零七百一十五匹，占应执行的百分之六十一点四三。
