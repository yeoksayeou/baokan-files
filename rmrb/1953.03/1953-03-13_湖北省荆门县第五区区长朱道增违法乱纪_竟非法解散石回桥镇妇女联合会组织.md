Reader Wang Xiangcheng writes: I request Jingmen County, Hubei Province, to promptly address the errors of Zhu Daozeng, the district chief of the Fifth District, who disregards women's rights, fails to handle divorce cases according to the Marriage Law, and illegally dissolves the Women's Federation of Shi Huiqiao Town. Song Zhaolian, a cadre in the Fifth District of Jingmen County, has consistently discriminated against his wife, Liu Wuxiu. After he was promoted to district finance and grain assistant in 1951, he demanded a divorce from Liu Wuxiu, but the government did not approve it. In December 1952, Liu Wuxiu had an argument with her sister-in-law because she resisted domestic abuse. Song Zhaolian happened to come home and took the opportunity to say that Liu Wuxiu was bad and again demanded a divorce. He said to Liu Wuxiu, "If you want to argue, come with me to the district." After arriving at the district government, Song Zhaolian ran to District Chief Zhu Daozeng's room and requested a divorce. Zhu Daozeng neither mediated the divorce case nor clarified right from wrong, but instead instructed the civil affairs assistant to write a divorce certificate. Liu Wuxiu had no choice but to agree. For the sake of her livelihood, she requested 200,000 yuan in alimony; however, she did not dare to mention the family property. But the civil affairs assistant said, "Song Zhaolian has no money, where would he get 200,000 yuan to give you? Would 50,000 yuan be acceptable? The child will be surnamed Song in the future!" Liu Wuxiu said with tears in her eyes, "Then I don't want anything. If I can't have the child in the future, I won't take it now either." The civil affairs assistant said, "That's fine! The child will not be separated from the mother. You have to raise the child for him." Thus, they divorced on December 12, 1952.

After the divorce, Liu Wuxiu had no means of living and temporarily lived in Song Zhaolian's home, cutting grass to survive. Song Zhaolian did not want Liu Wuxiu to live there and lied to her, saying, "I have separated from my brother (in reality, they had not), and the house and furniture have been divided between us." Liu Wuxiu had no choice but to complain to Gao Kun, the director of the District Women's Federation. Gao Kun expressed her opinion to the district leaders, saying, "The district government's handling of Liu Wuxiu's divorce case was hasty. There was no mediation, the woman did not receive any property after the divorce, and the children were not jointly raised and educated." District Party Secretary Wu Chungeng replied, "The district committee has approved it!" Gao Kun reported this situation to the County Women's Federation.

The Women's Federation of Shi Huiqiao Town in the Fifth District of Jingmen County and several women representatives believed that the district government's handling of Liu Wuxiu's divorce case was inappropriate and also expressed their opinions to the Fifth District People's Government. The district government's reply was: "Send representatives to talk!"

But the next day, the district government summoned Du Zufang (family member of a soldier), a women's representative of Shi Huiqiao Town. District Chief Zhu Daozeng personally intervened, asking who told her to express her opinion. If she didn't tell, she would be detained. In order to suppress the other party's defense, Zhu Daozeng added a crime to Du Zufang: "You are reactionary women from the past, we will suppress you. With people like you, there will be no district government! What does someone else's marriage have to do with you? The leader deserves a prison sentence! In the future, you must get permission from the district before holding meetings, otherwise it will be a reactionary meeting, and you must stop your activities!" As a result, he dissolved the Women's Federation of the town, which had grown from more than 30 people to more than 120 people!

I believe that Zhu Daozeng's mistakes are very serious, and I hope that the Jingmen County People's Government will immediately investigate and deal with them.

    湖北省荆门县第五区区长朱道增违法乱纪
    竟非法解散石回桥镇妇女联合会组织
    读者王相成来信：我要求湖北省荆门县迅速处理第五区区长朱道增漠视妇女权益，不按婚姻法处理离婚案件，并非法解散石回桥镇妇女联合会组织的错误。荆门县第五区干部宋照廉，一贯歧视自己的女人刘武秀。一九五一年他被提升为区财粮助理员以后，便要求和刘武秀离婚，但政府不批准。一九五二年十二月，刘武秀因反抗家庭虐待和嫂子发生口角，宋照廉正巧回家，便趁机说刘武秀不好，再次提出离婚。他对刘武秀说：“你要吵，跟我到区里去吵。”到区政府以后，宋照廉就跑到区长朱道增的房里，向朱道增提出离婚要求。朱道增对于这件离婚案既未调解，也不分清是非，便叫民政助理员写了离婚证。刘武秀没有办法，只好答应。她为了生活，要求二十万元的赡养费；对于家庭财产，则没敢提。但民政助理员却说，“宋照廉没钱，往那里弄二十万元给你？给五万元行不行？孩子将来是姓宋的！”刘武秀含着泪说：“那我就什么都不要。如果将来我不能要孩子，现在我也不带。”民政助理员说：“那还行！孩子不离娘。你得给他养孩子。”就这样在一九五二年十二月十二日离了婚。
    离婚后，刘武秀生活无着，暂住在宋照廉的家里，割草度日。宋照廉不愿让刘武秀住，骗她说：“我和哥哥分了家（实际是没分），房子家具都分给他了。”刘武秀没办法，便向区妇联主任高昆哭诉。高昆向区领导干部提出意见说：“区政府处理刘武秀的离婚案是草率的，没有经过调解，离婚后女方也没有分到财产，子女也不是共同抚养教育。”区委书记吴春耕却答复说：“区委批准了！”高昆把这个情况向县妇联作了报告。
    荆门县第五区石回桥镇妇女联合会和几个妇女代表，认为区政府对刘武秀离婚案的处理不妥当，也向第五区人民政府提出意见。区人民政府的答复是：“派代表来谈！”
    但就在第二天，区政府把石回桥镇妇女代表杜祖芳（军属）叫去了。区长朱道增亲自出马，追问她是谁叫她提意见的。不说就要扣起来。为了压制对方的申辩，朱道增给杜祖芳加上了罪名：“你们是过去的反动妇女，要镇压你们，有了你们这种人，就没有区政府了！别人的婚姻，和你们有什么相干？为首的值得判徒刑！以后你们开会先要经区里许可，不然就是反动会，停止活动！”结果，他竟把该镇由三十多人发展到一百二十多人的妇女联合会给解散了！
    朱道增所犯的错误，我认为是非常严重的，希望荆门县人民政府立即检查处理。
