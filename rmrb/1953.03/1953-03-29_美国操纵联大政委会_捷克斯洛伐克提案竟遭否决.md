Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 27th: TASS reported that the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee, at its afternoon meeting on the 26th, voted on the Czechoslovak delegation's proposal regarding the issue of US interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

The representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, and Belarus voted in favor of the proposal. Forty-one delegations (including the United States, Britain, and France) voted against the proposal. Fourteen delegations abstained (India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, Argentina, and Guatemala).

Representatives of Asian and Arab countries, including Iran and Syria, said in explaining their voting motives that although they abstained from voting on the Czechoslovak proposal, this did not mean they did not condemn certain countries for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. The representatives of Syria and Iraq pointed out in their speeches that the Zionist movement, headed by the Israeli authorities, is a form of carrying out crude interference and terrorist activities. The Syrian representative said: Zionist elements are persecuting and slaughtering tens of thousands of peace-loving Arab citizens and hundreds of thousands of Arab pregnant women.

The Guatemalan representative said: The Guatemalan government firmly condemns certain countries for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. He asked the committee to note that not long ago, US diplomat [John Moors] Cabot requested interference in the internal affairs of Guatemala.

It can be seen that although the fourteen delegations abstained from voting on the Czechoslovak proposal and did not dare to vote in favor of the Czechoslovak proposal, they actually hated the United States for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

    美国操纵联大政委会
    捷克斯洛伐克提案竟遭否决
    【新华社二十八日讯】　塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：联合国大会政治委员会二十六日下午会议表决了捷克斯洛伐克代表团提出的关于美国干涉他国内政问题的提案。
    苏联、波兰、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克和白俄罗斯代表投票赞成这个提案。四十一个代表团（包括美国、英国和法国）投票反对这个提案。十四国代表弃权（印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、巴基斯坦、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、也门、阿富汗、缅甸、埃及、阿根廷和危地马拉）。
    包括伊朗和叙利亚在内的亚洲和阿拉伯国家的代表在解释投票动机时说：虽然他们在表决捷克斯洛伐克提案时弃权，可是，这并不是说他们不斥责某些国家干涉其他国家的内政。叙利亚和伊拉克的代表在他们的发言中指出，以以色列当局为首的犹太复国运动是进行粗暴的干涉与恐怖活动的一种形式。叙利亚代表说：犹太复国运动者正在迫害和屠杀成千成万爱好和平的阿拉伯公民和成百成千的阿拉伯孕妇。
    危地马拉代表说：危地马拉政府坚决地指责某些国家干涉其他国家的内政。他要求委员会注意：不久以前，美国外交人员布莱敦曾要求干涉危地马拉的内政。
    人们可以看到，十四国代表团虽然在表决捷克斯洛伐克提案时弃权，不敢投票赞成捷克斯洛伐克提案，可是，实际上是痛恨美国干涉其他国家的内政的。
