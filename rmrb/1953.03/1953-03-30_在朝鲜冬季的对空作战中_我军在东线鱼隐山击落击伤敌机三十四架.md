(Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 29th) In the past three months of winter combat in Korea, on Yuhyun Mountain in the east, the anti-aircraft gunners, who have been repeatedly commended by their superiors, have continuously inflicted devastating blows on enemy aircraft, shooting down 11 enemy planes and damaging 23.

	Whenever the morning mist still shrouded the towering peaks, the anti-aircraft gunners of our army on Yuhyun Mountain would drink their fill of warming spicy soup, come out of the tunnels, clear the snow from the communication trenches and "aerial hunting grounds" with iron shovels and brooms, set up their weapons, and begin a day of combat.

	On December 22nd, the weather was clear, but particularly cold. Fourteen enemy planes came to circle and strafe at dawn, one of which was shot down by the hunters. The remaining enemy planes dived down fiercely in three groups. The hunters turned their guns, aimed at the enemy planes, and shot down two more, and the rest of the enemy planes fled in panic. The hunters quickly put their frozen hands into their sleeves to warm them. Before their hands were warmed up, more than thirty enemy planes came, bombing and strafing wildly as soon as they arrived. A bullet pierced the cheek of hunter Xu Zhonggui, and blood streamed down his face, making it difficult for him to speak. The platoon leader wanted him to go down to rest, but he insisted on continuing the fight. The blood froze into ice on his stern face, and streams of bullets were continuously fired from his gun.

	The hunters devised ingenious ways to deal with the enemy's artillery spotting planes. This monster buzzed over our position all day, indicating targets for the enemy's artillery fire. The artillery spotting plane was equipped with steel plates, making it difficult for anti-aircraft machine gun bullets to penetrate. Hunter Yang Maolin aimed and fired fiercely when it rolled from side to side to reconnoiter, and the bullets hit its side, causing it to fall down in flames. In this way, in two months, the anti-aircraft hunters on Yuhyun Mountain shot down four spotting planes and damaged two.

### 在朝鲜冬季的对空作战中  我军在东线鱼隐山击落击伤敌机三十四架

    在朝鲜冬季的对空作战中
    我军在东线鱼隐山击落击伤敌机三十四架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】在刚刚过去的朝鲜冬季三个月的作战中，在东线的鱼隐山上，受到上级多次表扬的对空射击手们，不断地给予敌机以毁灭性的打击，共击落敌机十一架，击伤敌机二十三架。
    每当清晨的浓雾还笼罩着耸立的山峰时，鱼隐山上的我军对空射击手们，就喝足御寒的辣汤，走出坑道，用铁锨和扫帚清除了交通沟和“对空猎场”上的积雪，架起自己的武器，开始了一天的战斗生活。
    十二月二十二日，天气晴朗，但特别寒冷。十四架敌机在天一亮就来盘旋扫射，被猎手们打落了一架，其余的敌机恶狠狠地分三路俯冲下来。猎手们便调转枪口，瞄准敌机，又打掉了两架，剩下的敌机便狼狈逃去了。猎手们连忙把冻得冰冷的手，插在袖筒里取暖，手还没暖过来，又来了三十多架敌机，一来就乱炸乱扫射。一颗子弹射穿了猎手许忠贵的面颊，血流满面，话也说不清。排长要他下去休息，但他继续坚持战斗。血在他严峻的脸上冻成了冰，一串串的子弹从他的枪口不断地发射出去。
    猎手们想出机智的办法，对付敌人的炮兵校正机。这个怪物整天在我阵地上空嗡嗡叫，给敌人的炮火指示射击目标。炮兵校正机下面装有钢板，高射机枪子弹很难打透。猎手杨茂林就瞅准它左右翻侧进行侦察时猛烈射击，子弹打中它的腹侧，它就燃烧着坠落下来了。这样，在两个月中，鱼隐山上的对空猎手们就打落了四架校正机，打伤了两架校正机。
