    Improving the Editing Work of Middle School Geography Textbooks

    At the symposium of geography teachers held by this newspaper's editorial department, the teachers raised many good opinions on the junior middle school national geography textbook, which is helpful for improving the textbook editing work in the future.

    The teachers' opinions show that our junior middle school national geography textbook is not satisfactorily edited. This is due on the one hand to the limitations of the editors' political and professional levels, and on the other hand to the poor planning and lack of seriousness and diligence of the textbook publishing and review authorities.

    The biggest shortcoming of the textbook is first of all the lack of political ideology. The editors do not use the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and method to correctly explain the relationship between geographical and social phenomena, but use anti-scientific viewpoints to explain the relationship between them. For example, the textbook reveals in many places that the decisive factor in social development seems to be the geographical environment. The editors have forgotten or ignored that although the geographical environment is "one of the constant and necessary conditions for social development, and it undoubtedly can affect the development of society, accelerating or delaying the process of social development. But its influence is not decisive..." The main force determining social development "is the mode of obtaining the means of subsistence necessary for people's survival, the mode of production of material resources." (Stalin: Dialectical and Historical Materialism)

    The textbook's failure to explain the past and present face of our great motherland and the future prospects through the narrative of geographical phenomena is also a major shortcoming. This is because the editors did not sufficiently realize the truth that "all science serves politics," so they only made a list of phenomena, and did not use vivid facts to show the superiority of the new social system and the great role of the people's creative activities under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government.

    Another shortcoming of the geography textbook is that it is dry and uninteresting, and it cannot arouse students' interest in geography class. The editors do not use beautiful writing and simple language to vividly depict the geographical features of our great motherland, but use abstract concepts to describe geographical and social phenomena in isolation. After reading the textbook, students are left with only a large pile of numbers and place names. How can students not feel bored!

    Because our geography textbooks have the above-mentioned major shortcomings in content and form, the effect of geography teaching is greatly weakened, and geography teaching cannot achieve the due teaching goals.

    In order to better improve the effect of geography teaching, it is absolutely necessary to improve the editing work of middle school geography textbooks. To complete this arduous and complex task, the educational leadership departments and textbook editing and review institutions should first formulate an editing plan for geography textbooks and draw up an outline for geography textbooks. Those participating in the textbook editing work must be people with a certain level of political understanding, professional knowledge and teaching experience. If conditions do not allow and it is necessary to entrust special personnel to write, the educational leadership department should give the textbook editors specific guidance. Before the textbook is published, it must be strictly reviewed.

    Of course, editing textbooks, especially primary and secondary school textbooks, is not an easy task, and one will inevitably encounter certain difficulties, but such difficulties can be overcome, and must be overcome in a short period of time.

### 改进中学地理课本的编辑工作

    改进中学地理课本的编辑工作
    在本报编辑部召开的地理教师座谈会上，教师们对初中本国地理课本提出了不少很好的意见，这对于今后课本编辑工作的改进是有帮助的。
    教师们的意见表明，我们的初中本国地理课本是编得不能令人满意的。这一方面固然因为编者受着政治水平和业务水平的限制，另一方面也说明了教科书出版机关和审查机关的计划性差，而且工作不够严肃，不够认真。
    课本的最大缺点，首先是缺乏政治思想性。编者不是用马克思列宁主义的观点和方法去正确地说明地理现象和社会现象之间的关系，而是用反科学的观点去说明它们之间的关系。比如，教科书不少地方流露着，似乎社会发展的决定因素是地理环境。编者忘掉了或忽视了地理环境虽然是“社会发展的经常必要的条件之一，而且它无疑是能影响到社会的发展，加速或延缓社会发展进程。但它的影响并不是决定的影响……”决定社会发展的主要力量“是人们生存所必需的生活资料谋得方式，是物质资料生产方式”。（斯大林：辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义）
    课本未能通过地理现象的叙述，说明我们伟大祖国过去和今天的面貌以及未来的远景，也是一个重大的缺点。这是由于编者没有足够地认识到“一切科学都是为政治服务的”这个道理，所以只做了现象的罗列，没有用生动的事实来表现新的社会制度的优越性以及在共产党和人民政府领导下人民创造性活动的伟大作用。
    地理课本的另一个缺点，是枯燥乏味，它不能引起同学对地理课的兴趣。编者不是用优美的文笔、浅近的文字，去生动地描画我们伟大祖国的地理面貌，而是用抽象的概念，孤立地叙述地理现象和社会现象。同学们读了课本之后，心中留下来的，只是一大堆的数字和地名。这样，同学们那能不感到索然乏味呢！
    我们的地理课本由于在内容上和形式上存在着上述重大缺点，就大大地减弱了地理教学的效果，使地理教学不能达到应有的教学目的。
    为了更好地提高地理教学的效果，改进中学地理课本的编辑工作，是完全必要的。要完成这件繁重、复杂的工作，教育领导部门和教科书编审机关首先应该订出地理课本的编辑计划，拟出地理课本的纲要。参加课本编辑工作的，必须是具有一定的政治水平、业务知识和教学经验的人。假如条件不允许，必须委托专人编写时，教育领导部门更应该给课本的编者以具体指导。在课本出版以前，必须进行严格审查。
    当然，编辑课本，尤其是中小学课本，不是一件轻易的事情，一定会遇到某些困难，但这种困难是可以克服的，而且必须在短时间内克服它。
