    Xinhua News Agency, Tehran: Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh rejected the new US-British proposal regarding a "solution" to the Anglo-Iranian oil problem on the 20th.

    The new proposal was delivered to the Iranian government by the US Ambassador to Iran, Henderson, on February 20th. Nominally, it was a British government proposal, but judging from the series of activities before the proposal was drafted and the manner in which it was presented, it was actually a joint US-British proposal. As everyone knows, US Assistant Secretary of State Byroade visited London in early January to "seek basic solutions to the Anglo-Iranian oil problem" with the British government. Following this, Henderson "visited" Mossadegh several times. While presenting the so-called British proposal to the Iranian government this time, Henderson also put forward a US proposal, promising to purchase Iranian oil after Iran resolved the compensation issue according to the British proposal. US Secretary of State Dulles and British Foreign Secretary Eden openly declared in a joint communiqué issued on March 7: "The United States believes that these proposals (referring to the British proposals) are fair and reasonable."

    The governments of the United States, Britain, and Iran have not yet announced the contents of the new proposal, but from Mossadegh's broadcast on March 20, it can be seen that the so-called new British proposal is basically the same as the proposal put forward in August last year in the form of a joint letter from Truman and Churchill. The aim is to jointly interfere with Iran's implementation of oil nationalization. That proposal was widely opposed by the Iranian people. This time, Britain still demands "compensation" for the losses of its "enterprises" in Iran. According to the British government's past interpretation, this refers to the loss of property of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which has been nationalized, including the loss of profits obtained by the company after nationalization. Britain also still demands that the compensation issue be submitted to the International Court of Justice for "arbitration," that is to say, Britain still does not recognize that Iran's implementation of oil nationalization is Iran's internal affair. The rejection of the new US-British proposal shows that, under the strong opposition of the Iranian people, the conspiracy of US-British imperialism to interfere with Iran's implementation of oil nationalization has not been successfully realized.

    It is worth noting that the United States proposed in this proposal that it is willing to lend 100 million US dollars to Iran after the Iranian government accepts the British proposal. In the US-British joint proposal last August, the United States only promised to lend 10 million US dollars. This shows that in order to intensify the seizure of control over Iranian oil and squeeze out Britain's position, US imperialism is now willing to offer a higher price.

### 在伊朗人民强烈反对下美英帝国主义干涉阴谋再次失败  伊朗政府拒绝美英“解决”石油问题的新建议

    在伊朗人民强烈反对下美英帝国主义干涉阴谋再次失败
    伊朗政府拒绝美英“解决”石油问题的新建议
    【新华社讯】德黑兰消息：伊朗首相摩萨台在二十日拒绝了美英政府关于“解决”英伊石油问题的新建议。
    新建议是由美国驻伊朗大使汉德逊在二月二十日交给伊朗政府的。名义上，它是英国政府的建议，但从拟成这建议之前的一连串活动和提出的方式来看，实际上它是美英政府的联合建议。大家知道，美国助理国务卿拜娄德一月初曾到伦敦和英国政府“寻求解决英伊石油问题的基本办法”。接着，汉德逊“访问”了摩萨台好多次。汉德逊这次在向伊朗政府提出所谓英国的建议同时，也提出了美国的建议，答应在伊朗照英国建议解决了赔偿问题以后，购买伊朗的石油。美国国务卿杜勒斯和英国外交大臣艾登在三月七日发表的联合会谈公报中更公开声明：“美国认为这些建议（指英国建议）是公平合理的。”
    美国、英国、伊朗三国政府一直都没有公布新建议的内容，但从摩萨台三月二十日发表的广播中可以看出，英国的所谓新建议，和去年八月间以杜鲁门和邱吉尔联名信的方式提出的建议，基本上没有什么不同，目的都是企图共同干涉伊朗实行石油国有化。那个建议曾遭到伊朗人民的普遍反对。英国这一次仍然要求“赔偿”它在伊朗的“企业”的损失。按照英国政府过去的解释，这就是指已被国有化的前英伊石油公司的财产损失，包括该公司在国有化以后所得利润的损失。英国也仍然要求把赔偿问题提交国际法庭“仲裁”，也就是说，英国仍不承认伊朗实行石油国有化是伊朗的内政问题。美英政府的新建议遭到拒绝，说明在伊朗人民强烈反对下，美英帝国主义干涉伊朗实行石油国有化的阴谋，还不能顺利实现。
    值得注意的是：这次美国在建议中提出，在伊朗政府接受英国建议后，愿意贷款一亿美元给伊朗。去年八月的美英联合建议中，美国只答应贷款一千万美元。这表明，美帝国主义者为了加紧夺取对伊朗石油的控制权，排挤英国的地位，现在已不惜出更高的价钱。
