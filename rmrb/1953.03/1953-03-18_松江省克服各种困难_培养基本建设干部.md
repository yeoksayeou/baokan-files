    Songjiang Province Overcomes Difficulties to Train Basic Construction Cadres

    In order to meet the needs of large-scale basic construction, Songjiang Province is vigorously training various basic construction cadres.

    The scale of training basic construction cadres in Songjiang Province is large and the scope is wide. The construction site director training class organized by the Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau and the Party and mass cadre training class held in Harbin City have a total of nearly 1,500 students. The Harbin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau also plans to train 1,000 various basic construction cadres during the construction preparation stage. Various engineering companies have also separately or jointly held training classes to train grassroots management cadres such as construction workers, accountants, statisticians, material clerks, and wage clerks. Some of the students in these training classes are in-service cadres of the basic construction department, some are active workers who are preparing to be promoted to cadres, and some are newly recruited middle and primary school graduates and registered unemployed intellectuals.

    This large-scale training work is being carried out under extremely busy basic construction preparations. At the beginning, there were difficulties in terms of teachers, teaching materials, classrooms, and funding. However, thanks to the unified leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees and the close cooperation and support of basic construction departments, government, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League, these difficulties have been overcome. For example, political instructors are uniformly appointed by the provincial and municipal winter training committees, and the ministers and directors of the provincial and municipal Party committees, and the directors of the provincial and municipal construction engineering bureaus take turns giving political lessons to the training classes, which overcomes the shortage of teachers in various units and ensures the quality of teaching. At the same time, many training classes have cadres sent by the provincial Party committee, municipal Party committee, Communist Youth League, trade union, construction engineering bureau and other leading organs to take charge of leadership work, which strengthens the political work of the training classes. The Provincial Winter Training Committee also absorbed personnel from the Party committee, government and other relevant departments to compile political and professional textbooks, and uniformly printed and distributed them to the training classes. Dozens of textbooks have now been published.

    In various cadre training classes, in addition to conducting relevant professional education, political education is also generally carried out in light of the ideological situation of the cadres, so that these cadres can establish the idea of serving basic construction for a long time, relying on the working class, and attaching importance to the promotion of advanced experience. Administrative leading cadres and Party and mass work cadres will also receive education on advanced experience and technical knowledge, so that they can understand the content of important advanced experience and general technical knowledge, so as to gradually grasp the laws of basic construction and better carry out management work and political work.

    In order to ensure the quality of trained cadres, it is necessary to oppose and criticize departmentalism. This is a lesson learned from the work of training cadres in Songjiang Province. In the early stage of winter training, some basic construction units, due to departmentalism, were afraid that cadres would be transferred after training, and did not comply with the regulations of the leadership, sending food administrators, cooks, or those who were about to be expelled to the Party and mass cadre training class for training. The quality of the students in the construction site director training class run by the Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau was also uneven. After the training class was completed, some students were still unable to take on the work of construction site director, which is actually a waste. This phenomenon must be corrected immediately.

### 松江省克服各种困难  培养基本建设干部

    松江省克服各种困难
    培养基本建设干部
    为适应大规模基本建设的需要，松江省正大力培养与训练各种基本建设工作干部。
    松江省培养和训练基本建设干部的规模很大，范围很广。省建筑工程局举办的工地主任训练班和哈尔滨市举办的党群干部训练班，总共有将近一千五百名学员。哈尔滨市建筑工程局还计划在施工准备阶段中训练一千名各种基本建设工作干部。各工程公司也都分别或联合举办了培养施工员、会计员、统计员、材料员、工资员等基层管理干部的训练班。这些训练班的学员，一部分是基本建设部门的在职干部，一部分是准备提拔为干部的工人积极分子，一部分是新招收的中、小学毕业学生和已登记的失业知识分子。
    这种大规模地培养和训练工作，是在基本建设准备工作极为繁忙的情况下进行的，开始时在教员、教材、教室、经费等方面都有困难。但由于省市党委实行统一领导，基本建设部门、政府、工会和青年团等各方面密切配合和支援，这些困难都克服了。如政治教员都由省和市的冬训委员会统一聘定，省委和市委的部长、处长，省的和市的建筑工程局长都轮流为各训练班讲政治课，克服了各单位教员不足的困难，保证了教学的质量。同时，许多训练班都有省委、市委、青年团、工会、建筑工程局等领导机关派去的干部担任领导工作，加强了训练班的政治工作。省冬训委员会并吸收党委、政府以及其他有关部门的人员，编选政治教材和业务教材，统一印刷分发给各训练班，现在出版的课本已达数十种。
    在各种干部训练班中，除分别进行有关的业务教育外，并针对干部思想情况普遍进行政治教育，使这些干部树立长期为基本建设服务的思想，依靠工人阶级的思想，以及重视推广先进经验的思想。对行政领导干部和党群工作干部，还要进行有关先进经验和技术知识的教育，使他们懂得重要先进经验的内容和一般技术知识，从而逐渐掌握基本建设规律，更好地进行管理工作和政治工作。
    为了保证受训干部的质量，必须反对和批判本位思想。这是松江省培养和训练干部工作的一个教训。在冬训初期，某些基本建设单位由于本位主义思想作怪，怕干部受训后被调走，不遵守领导上的规定，把伙食管理员、炊事员或准备开除的分子送到党群干部训练班去受训。省建筑工程局所办的工地主任训练班学员的质量也很不齐，训练班结业后仍有一部分学员不能担当起工地主任的工作，这实际上是一种浪费。对这种现象，必须即时纠正。
