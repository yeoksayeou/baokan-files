Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the issue of US interference in the internal affairs of other countries on the 23rd. This issue was included in the agenda of the General Assembly at the suggestion of the Czechoslovak delegation.
	At the morning session, Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Václav David spoke first, delivering a detailed speech. He said that the US government passed the so-called "Mutual Security Act," thus, for the first time in the history of international relations, openly and directly approving interference in the internal affairs of other countries in its legislation and making such interference part of its plan. It is the first time in the history of international relations that a country's government has directly declared in its laws that blatantly violating the most basic principles of international relations and the most basic principles of peaceful coexistence among nations is part of its policy.
	David continued: The Czechoslovak delegation requested that this issue be included in the agenda of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly because the Czechoslovak delegation believes that discussing this issue at the United Nations will help promote peace and international security, because US interference in the internal affairs of countries in the peace camp greatly exacerbates international tensions and seriously undermines the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.
	The Czechoslovak Foreign Minister pointed out that the US policy towards Czechoslovakia after the war was to try its best to obstruct the realization of the wishes of the Czechoslovak people and to try its best to build their country according to their wishes. Throughout this period, the United States attempted to make Czechoslovakia politically and economically subordinate to the United States, attempted to restore the capitalist system in Czechoslovakia against the wishes of the Czechoslovak people, attempted to undermine Czechoslovakia's alliance with the Soviet Union, and turn the country into a tool for carrying out US anti-Soviet war conspiracies.
	David said: The United States attempted to take advantage of the economic difficulties of our country to conquer Czechoslovakia. The economic pressure used by the US government did not achieve the results it expected. Czechoslovakia, like other people's democracies, relied on the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to defeat these conspiracies and is victoriously building its peaceful economy. After encountering this failure, the US ruling clique attempted to achieve its goals by using the coup d'état instigated by the reactionaries in February 1948. However, the Czechoslovak people crushed the conspiracy of the reactionary forces and further consolidated the Czechoslovak regime and the people's democratic system. After the US ruling clique's hope of changing the situation in Czechoslovakia by using traitorous politicians and reactionary coups was dashed, it is looking for other ways. David pointed out that conspiracy, sabotage and espionage have become part of these methods.
	At the afternoon session, Soviet Representative Gromyko delivered a long speech (see the special column on the right for a summary of the speech).
	US Representative Lodge then spoke, saying that the statements quoted by the Soviet representative in his speech, such as the talks of Dulles, Stassen, and other prominent Republican leaders, were obviously not official but merely private talks. Lodge also said that Dewey's statement does not count because Dewey is a state governor, and states have no diplomatic relations.

    联大政委会讨论美国干涉他国内政问题
    苏捷代表痛斥美国进行破坏活动
    据新华社讯：联合国大会政治委员会在二十三日开始讨论关于美国干涉其他国家内政的问题。这一问题是根据捷克斯洛伐克代表团的提议列入大会议程的。
    在上午会议上，捷克斯洛伐克外交部长瓦茨拉夫·戴维首先发言，他发表了一篇详尽的演说。他说，美国政府通过了所谓“共同安全法”，这样就在国际关系史上第一次地在它的立法上，公开和直接地批准了干涉他国内政并以这种干涉作为它的计划。在国际关系史上，一个国家的政府在它的法律上直接宣布以悍然违反国际关系的最基本原则和各国和平共处的最基本原则为它的政策的一部分，这还是第一次。
    戴维接着说：捷克斯洛伐克代表团要求把这个问题列入联合国第七届大会的议程。因为捷克斯洛伐克代表团认为：在联合国讨论这个问题，对促进和平和国际安全是有帮助的，因为美国干涉和平阵营国家的内政使得国际紧张局势大大地恶化，并且严重地破坏了联合国宪章的原则和宗旨。
    捷克斯洛伐克外交部长指出：美国在战后对捷克斯洛伐克的政策，是尽力阻挠捷克斯洛伐克人民愿望的实现，是尽力阻挠他们按照他们的愿望建设他们的国家。在这个整个时期里，美国曾企图使捷克斯洛伐克在政治上和经济上从属于美国，曾企图违反捷克斯洛伐克人民的愿望，在捷克斯洛伐克恢复资本主义制度，曾企图破坏捷克斯洛伐克与苏联的联盟，并把这个国家变成实行美国反苏战争阴谋的工具。
    戴维说：美国企图利用我们国家经济的困难来征服捷克斯洛伐克。美国政府所使用的经济压力并没有得到它所预期的结果。捷克斯洛伐克和其他人民民主国家一样，依靠苏联大公无私的援助，击败了这些阴谋，并正在胜利地建设它的和平经济。美国统治集团在遇到这种失败之后企图利用反动派在一九四八年二月鼓动的政变来达到它的目的。但是捷克斯洛伐克人民粉碎了反动势力的阴谋，并且更加巩固了捷克斯洛伐克的政权和人民民主制度。美国统治集团在利用卖国政客和反动派政变来改变捷克斯洛伐克形势的希望落空以后，就正在寻找其他的办法。戴维指出：阴谋破坏和间谍活动就成了这些办法中的一部分。
    在下午会议上，苏联代表葛罗米柯发表了长篇演说（演说摘要见右特栏）。
    美国代表洛奇接着发言说：苏联代表在他演说中所引证的声明，例如杜勒斯、史塔生以及其他显著的共和党领袖们的谈话，他们显然不是代表官方而只是私人的谈话。洛奇还说：杜威的声明不能算数，因为杜威是一州的州长。而州是没有外交关系的。
