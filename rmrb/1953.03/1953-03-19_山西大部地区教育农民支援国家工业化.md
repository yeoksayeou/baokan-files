Most Areas of Shanxi Province Educate Farmers to Support National Industrialization

To better align agricultural production with the development of industrial production, Party and government leading organs in most areas of Shanxi Province have been educating farmers about national industrialization. From the beginning of January to now, many counties and districts have first convened cadre meetings and mutual aid cooperative representative meetings to enable rural cadres and farmer activists to understand the close relationship between industry and agriculture, the consistency between the interests of farmers and the interests of the state, and to examine and criticize various erroneous and muddled ideas. At the enlarged meeting of the CPC Huguan County Committee, the results of the cadres' ideological examination mainly revealed that: some cadres once believed that "industrialization is only a matter for big cities, and this is an agricultural area, which has little to do with us"; some, in the past, only considered the immediate interests of farmers in leading agricultural production, and one-sidedly promoted "planting high-yield and high-profit crops, and producing more grain to live a good life"; some held a condescending view of farmers, "complaining that the price of new-style plows was too high when promoting them, and complaining that the price of local products was too low when selling them." These erroneous ideas have been profoundly criticized. The mutual aid cooperative representative meetings held in various districts of Wuxiang County criticized the leaders of some mutual aid cooperative organizations for only caring about immediate interests and disregarding long-term interests, and for the blindness in managing agricultural production. It clearly put forward that planting crops must meet the needs of national industrialization. After the cadres' thinking was straightened out, various places further educated the vast number of farmers. At the publicity meeting in Jia Village, Xiangling County, when discussing how agricultural production should cooperate with industrial production, Yang Jinming said: "This year is the first year of large-scale national construction, and agricultural production should also be based on the needs of the country. The government asks us to stabilize the cotton field area on the original basis, and we should not blindly expand it, but strive to improve the unit area yield of cotton. At the same time, we must respond to the government's call to increase the production of grain needed by the country." After discussing the two questions of "What are the benefits of national industrialization for farmers?" and "How can we support national industrialization?", the members of the Zhang Chengfa Agricultural Production Cooperative newly established in Xiuren Village, Hejin County, immediately formulated the cooperative's production plan for 1953.

    山西大部地区教育农民支援国家工业化
    为了使农业生产更好地配合工业生产的发展，山西省大部地区党、政领导机关向农民进行了国家工业化的教育。从一月初到现在，许多县、区都首先召开干部会议和互助合作代表会议，使农村干部和农民积极分子弄清工业和农业之间的密切关系、农民利益和国家利益的一致，检查批判各种错误的、糊涂的思想。在中共壶关县委员会扩大会议上，干部思想检查的结果主要是：有的干部曾认为“工业化仅仅是大城市的事情，咱这里是农业区，与咱关系不大”；有的在过去领导农业生产中单纯从农民的眼前利益出发，片面地宣传“种植高产厚利作物，多打粮食过好时光”；有的对农民有恩赐观点，“推广新式步犁时光嫌价格太高，推销土产时光嫌价格太低”。这些错误思想都受到了深刻的批判。武乡县各区分别召开的互助合作代表会议，批判了某些互助合作组织的领导人中只顾眼前利益、不顾长远利益和经营农业生产的盲目性，明确提出了种庄稼一定要适合国家工业化的需要。干部思想搞通后，各地就进一步教育广大农民。襄陵县贾庄村的宣传会议，在讨论农业生产如何配合工业生产的问题时，杨金铭说：“今年是国家大规模建设的头一年，农业生产也要根据国家的需要。政府叫咱们把棉田面积稳定在原来的基础上，咱们就不要盲目扩大了，要努力提高棉花的单位面积产量。同时，咱们还要响应政府号召，增产国家需要的粮食。”河津县修仁村新建立的张成法农业生产合作社的社员，在讨论“国家工业化对农民有什么好处”和“我们怎样来支援国家工业化”两个问题后，立即订出了全社一九五三年的生产计划。　（新华社）
