    Strive to Further Strengthen the Work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea
    The Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, after returning to China in November of last year, conducted communication and reporting in major administrative regions, major cities, and transportation hubs throughout the country in the form of sub-delegations and groups, and have now successively and successfully completed their tasks. According to incomplete statistics, the delegation has made more than 3,200 communication reports in the four major administrative regions of Northeast, North China, East China, and Southwest China alone, with a direct audience of 6.25 million people. The number of people who indirectly heard the reports and listened to the radio is even greater.

    The glorious victories won by the finest sons and daughters of our people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, and the countless heroic and moving deeds, have always been an infinite source of encouragement and driving force for the people of the motherland in carrying out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, social reforms, and economic recovery. The communication reports of this delegation to Korea took place precisely when the motherland began large-scale construction of the first five-year plan, and our army on the Korean front also achieved a series of new victories, including the glorious victory in the Battle of Shangganling, and also when the U.S. aggressors used the United Nations to pass illegal resolutions, blatantly refused to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and openly clamored to expand the war of aggression against Korea. At this time, the communication reports of the delegation to Korea not only greatly boosted the will of the people across the country to strive for the complete victory of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, but also further promoted the upsurge of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and national construction.

    After listening to the communication reports, the broad masses of workers and peasants were deeply moved by the news of the victory in the Battle of Shangganling and the deeds of heroes such as Qiu Shaoyun and Huang Jiguang, greatly enhancing their enthusiasm for production. For example, after listening to the communication reports, the employees of the Yumen Oil Mine in Northwest China seriously revised their patriotic pledges and proposed plans to improve production. The daily output of the Datong Mine and Bagongshan Mine of the Huainan Coal Mine created a new record, increasing by 700 tons compared to the past. The workers said, "Although the Volunteer Army comrades do not have good tools, they have turned the hills of Korea into an underground Great Wall. We are mining in a peaceful environment, what difficulties can't we overcome?" The 200,000 migrant workers who are repairing the South Dongting Lake also expressed that they would learn from the spirit of the Volunteer Army and strive to make contributions. Among them, the young migrant workers of the Third Brigade of Yueyang County organized the "Iron and Steel Brigade." They said: Our Volunteer Army has built an iron-like "underground Great Wall" on the Korean front, and we must also build an "iron and steel dike" in the "granary" of the motherland—the South Dongting Lake area.

    On the one hand, the communication reports of the delegation representatives explained to the broad masses that our army on the Korean front is fully confident of fighting all the way to a complete victory and smashing the enemy's conspiracy to continue and expand the war. At the same time, it also further raised the vigilance of the people across the country, corrected the blind optimism and pacifist paralysis of some people, and further promoted the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. For example, Xia Xiaofa, a propagandist from Yuanqiao District, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, said: "When mobilizing to join the army the year before last, I was very active in publicizing the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea; later, I saw that we had won many victories on the Korean front, and I felt that defeating the enemy was not a problem, so I gradually relaxed the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. After listening to the communication reports this time, I realized that this is a slack thought, and I must correct this thought and do a good job in propaganda work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea." After listening to the reports, the militiamen and worker pickets in coastal areas of Fujian Province also examined their pacifist paralysis. Militiaman Wang Yuanzhang said: "We must defend the coast as firmly as the Korean front. If the enemy dares to invade, we will definitely wipe them out." The communication reports of the delegation have actually become a powerful mobilization for the people to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in many areas. After listening to the reports, people from all walks of life have examined and revised their patriotic pledges, wrote letters of condolences and sent gifts to the Volunteer Army, strengthened the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, launched a competition to increase production and practice economy to complete production plans, launched a movement to learn from the Volunteer Army, and groups of medical workers and railway workers from various places went to Korea to support the front line.

    The delegation's visit to Korea and communication reports have further boosted the morale of our army on the front line and the patriotic enthusiasm of the people across the country. This achievement is extremely valuable, and the Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea sub-committees in various places should attach special importance to it and consolidate and promote it, and promote the people of the whole country to strive to implement the "Instructions on Continuing to Strengthen the Work of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea" issued by the General Association for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea on December 22 last year.

### 为继续加强抗美援朝工作而斗争

    为继续加强抗美援朝工作而斗争
    中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团，自去年十一月回国后，即以分团和小组为单位，前往全国各大行政区、主要城镇和交通要道进行传达报告，现在都已先后胜利完成任务。据不完全统计，慰问团仅在东北、华北、华东、西南四大行政区各地，就作了三千二百多次的传达报告，直接听到报告的人数达六百二十五万人，至于间接听到传达和收听广播的人数，为数更多。
    我国人民最优秀的子女——中国人民志愿军在与朝鲜人民军并肩作战中所取得的辉煌胜利，和无数英雄们可歌可泣的战斗事迹，一直就成了祖国人民进行抗美援朝运动、社会改革和经济恢复工作中无限的鼓舞和推动力量。这次赴朝慰问团进行传达报告，正是在祖国开始进行第一个五年计划的大规模建设，朝鲜前线我军也取得一系列的新胜利，包括上甘岭战役辉煌胜利在内的时候，同时也是在美国侵略者利用联合国通过非法决议，悍然拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，且公然叫嚣扩大侵朝战争的时候。在这时候，赴朝慰问团的传达报告，不仅大大鼓舞了全国人民争取抗美援朝斗争的完全胜利的意志，而且进一步推动了抗美援朝和国家建设的热潮。
    广大的工人和农民听了传达报告后，都深为上甘岭战役的胜利消息和邱少云、黄继光等英雄的事迹所感动，大大提高了生产积极性。例如，西北玉门油矿职工们听了传达报告后，都认真地修订了爱国公约，纷纷提出改进生产的计划；淮南煤矿的大通矿和八公山矿的日产量创造了新纪录，比过去增加了七百吨，工人们说：“志愿军同志虽然没有好工具，却把朝鲜的山岗挖成了地下长城，我们在和平环境中采矿，还有什么克服不了的困难呢。”整修南洞庭湖的二十万民工也表示要学习志愿军的精神，争取立功，其中岳阳县第三大队的青年民工组织了“钢铁大队”，他们说：我们志愿军在朝鲜前线筑起了钢铁般的“地下长城”，我们在祖国的“粮仓”——南洞庭湖流域也要筑起一条“钢铁长堤”。
    慰问团代表们的传达报告，一方面向广大群众说明了朝鲜前线我军完全有把握一直打到彻底的胜利，粉碎敌人继续进行扩大战争的阴谋；同时，也更加提高了全国人民的警惕性，纠正了一部分人的盲目乐观和太平麻痹思想，进一步推动了抗美援朝运动。比如浙江黄岩县院桥区宣传员夏小法说：“在前年动员参军时，我对抗美援朝的宣传工作做得很积极；以后我看见我们在朝鲜前线打了很多胜仗，觉得打败敌人不成问题，就慢慢把抗美援朝工作放松了。这次听了传达报告，知道这是松懈思想，我一定要纠正这种思想，搞好抗美援朝宣传工作。”福建省沿海各地的民兵和工人纠察队听了报告后，也检查了太平麻痹思想。民兵王远章说：“我们要把海防守卫得像朝鲜前线一样巩固，敌人要敢来侵犯，我们一定把它消灭干净。”慰问团的传达报告，在许多地区实际上都变成了人民群众加强抗美援朝工作的有力动员，各界人民听了报告后纷纷检查和修订爱国公约，给志愿军写慰问信送慰问品，加强拥军优属工作，发起增产节约完成生产计划的竞赛，开展学习志愿军运动，各地医务工作者和铁路职工一批又一批地赴朝支援前线。
    这次慰问团赴朝慰问和传达报告，进一步鼓舞了前线我军的作战士气和全国人民的爱国热情。这个成就，是极为宝贵的，各地抗美援朝分会应予特别重视，并加以巩固和发扬光大，推动全国人民为贯彻抗美援朝总会去年十二月二十二日发出的“关于继续加强抗美援朝工作的指示”而奋斗。
