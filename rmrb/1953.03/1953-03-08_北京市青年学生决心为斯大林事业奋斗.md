The broad masses of young students in Beijing were deeply saddened upon hearing the news of Comrade Stalin's death. They are a generation that grew up in the Stalin era and were educated by Stalinist teachings. While mourning Comrade Stalin's death, they all vowed to study hard and build a great motherland.

The unfortunate news of Comrade Stalin's death brought unprecedented grief to all teachers and students of Renmin University of China. Some students voluntarily went to the cooperative to buy black纱 (gauze) to wear on their left arms; some students took out their beloved works by Stalin, hugged and stroked them, and couldn't help but cry; some students silently looked at the photo of the respected Comrade Stalin and said, "This can't be true, this can't be true."

In order to mourn Comrade Stalin, various departments and sections of the school held small group discussions. Zhang Yichang, a student of the Industrial Management Department and a first-class labor model in the Northeast, recalled at a group meeting that his happiness and honor were inseparable from the great Comrade Stalin. He worked in the Shenyang Chemical Plant, but lacked work experience. The experts sent by Stalin patiently helped them, enabling him to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and become a labor model. Under the cultivation and care of the Party, he came to Renmin University to study. Here, the experts sent by Stalin guided them with tireless spirit. He said sadly and affectionately, "Every moment I deeply feel the warmth given to me by the respected Comrade Stalin."

When the students of Peking University heard this unfortunate news, many of them cried. All faculty and students observed a two-minute silence before dinner, and each department sent representatives to the Soviet Embassy in the city that evening to offer condolences. In addition to the general feeling of grief, the students also realized that they should turn grief into strength. Many students wrote letters requesting to join the Party and the League. Party members and League members also resolved to be better Party members and League members. Tao Maoqi, a sophomore, said, "After hearing this sad news, I remembered that I didn't concentrate when listening to the algebra class this morning, and I felt sorry for Comrade Stalin. I am determined to work hard in the future and strive to join the Party in this year of his death."

Tsinghua University was in the middle of exams. More than 1,000 students quietly reading in the library were suddenly stunned when they heard the news of Comrade Stalin's death. People in classrooms and dormitories poured out together, gathered on the lawn to listen to the radio, automatically stood at attention and listened quietly, and many people lowered their heads and sobbed, listening again and again. After returning to the dormitories, the students mostly lay on the beds and cried, and everyone could no longer read. The Party and League branches immediately received many applications to join the Party and the League. The applications generally stated that Comrade Stalin's death was an irreparable loss to the Party and the people, and asked to strive to join the Party and the League. Many Party members also wrote letters of determination, expressing their determination to fight to the end for the cause of communism.

Many students at Beijing Normal University burst into tears after hearing the news of Comrade Stalin's death. President Chen Yuan repeatedly shed tears, saying, "In ancient books, it is said that after Yao and Shun died, the people mourned as if they had lost their parents. Now I truly understand this feeling." On the afternoon of the 6th, 58 students from the school wrote letters to the Party branch, expressing their determination to study hard and resolutely fight to the end for Stalin's cause.

Teachers, students, and cadres of the Central University for Nationalities were as grief-stricken as if they had lost a loving father after hearing this unfortunate news. Mongolian student Sulun Ga, Oroqen student Geken, and others burst into tears. The students of the 48 nationalities in the whole college, including Han, Tibetan, Hui, Mongolian, Miao, Yi, Zhuang, Uygur, Kazakh, Korean, and Gaoshan, each nationality sent a representative, dressed in their national costumes, to the Soviet Embassy to offer condolences. Many minority students and cadres, in studying Stalin's works on national issues, deeply realized the happiness that Stalin's national policy brought to the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and increased their confidence and strength in building the motherland and defending peace.

Teachers and students of the Central Academy of Drama held a memorial meeting that evening after hearing the news of Comrade Stalin's death.

More than 1,000 teachers, students, and staff of the China University of Mining and Technology held a gathering to hold a memorial ceremony.

All the faculty and staff of the Beijing University of Political Science and Law wrote a letter saying: We express our deep condolences on the unfortunate death of the respected Comrade Stalin. We must work harder to complete our teaching tasks, study the spirit and scientific theory of Comrade Stalin, and advance along the road pointed out by the respected Comrade Stalin.

All teachers, students, staff, and workers of Beijing No. 15 Middle School held a memorial meeting on the afternoon of the 6th with extremely sad feelings. After the meeting, teachers, students, staff, and workers all made their own work and study plans.

All the students of the Beijing Opera Experimental School wrote a letter saying: All of us mourn the death of Comrade Stalin with great grief. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, we must study harder, inherit the heritage of Chinese opera art, and better serve the construction of the motherland.

Wang Chengyu, a Young Pioneer of the third division of the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Middle School, wrote:

When we heard this unfortunate news, our hearts were as uncomfortable as if they were cut by a knife! We all cried so hard that we couldn't lift our heads, and tears flowed like rain, soaking the red scarves on our chests. We are sad, we are sad…. But when we saw the red scarf, we understood that we should turn grief into strength. Stalin will not die, he will always live in the bottom of everyone's heart.

I want to do a good job in the task assigned to me by the people of the motherland - study. Last semester, my studies improved from failing to eliminating failing grades, from only one subject with a score of four to half of the subjects reaching a score of five, but I will never be satisfied, I want to study harder and strive to achieve a score of five in all subjects.

For the cause of the motherland, for the cause of Stalin, I will strive to become a hero like Zoya, who was cultivated by Stalin.

    北京市青年学生决心为斯大林事业奋斗
    北京市广大青年学生听到斯大林同志逝世的消息后，都悲痛万分。他们是生长在斯大林时代，受斯大林学说教养的一代，他们在悼念斯大林同志逝世的时候，都立下了努力学习，建设伟大祖国的誓言。
    斯大林同志逝世的不幸消息，给中国人民大学全体师生带来了从来没有过的悲痛。有的同学自动地到合作社购买黑纱，佩带在左臂上；有的同学拿出自己心爱的斯大林的著作，紧抱着、抚摸着，不禁哭起来；有的同学默默地看着敬爱的斯大林同志的照片说：“这不会是真的，这不会是真的。”
    为了悼念斯大林同志，该校各个系、科都举行了小组漫谈会。工管系学生，东北区一等劳动模范张义昌在小组会上，回想到他的幸福和荣誉是和伟大的斯大林同志分不开的。他在沈阳化工厂工作，但是，缺乏工作经验。斯大林派来的专家耐心地帮助他们，使他学习了苏联的先进经验，成了劳动模范。在党的培养和爱护下，他到了人民大学来学习。在这里，斯大林派来的专家，又以不倦的精神指导着他们。他沉痛而又亲切地说：“我每一时每一刻都深深地感到敬爱的斯大林同志给我的温暖。”
    北京大学的同学听到这一不幸的消息时，很多人都哭了起来。全校员生在晚饭前默哀了两分钟，各部门都派代表在当晚进城去苏联大使馆吊唁。同学除普遍感到悲痛外，也认识到应当化悲痛为力量。很多同学写信要求入党、入团。党员团员也下决心做更好的党员团员。二年级陶懋颀说：“我听到这个悲哀的消息后，回想今天上午听代数课时没用心，就觉得对不起斯大林同志。我今后决心努力，争取在他逝世的今年入党。”
    清华大学正在考试期间，在图书馆静静看书的一千多同学，突然听到斯大林同志逝世的消息，一时都惊呆了。在课堂，在宿舍的人们一齐涌出来，聚在草场上听广播，自动立正静听，很多人低头饮泣，一遍一遍的听。在回到宿舍后，同学们大都躺在床上哭，大家再也看不下书去了。党、团总支立刻收到许多要求入党入团的申请书，申请书上大致都说，斯大林同志逝世是党和人民不可弥补的损失，要求自己争取入党入团。很多党员也纷纷写决心书，表示为共产主义事业奋斗到底的决心。
    北京师范大学的同学在听到斯大林同志逝世的消息后，许多人都痛哭失声。陈垣校长频频落泪，他说：“从前古书中说，尧舜死后，人民如丧考妣，现在真正体会到这种心情了。”六日下午，该校有五十八个学生向党的支部写信，表示努力学习，坚决为斯大林的事业奋斗到底。
    中央民族学院的师生和干部听到这一不幸的消息后，都像丧失慈父一样，悲痛万分。蒙族学员苏伦嘎、鄂伦春族学员格根等都痛哭失声。全院汉、藏、回、蒙、苗、彝、僮、维吾尔、哈萨克、朝鲜、高山等四十八个民族的学员，每一个民族推派了一个代表，穿着本民族的服装，前往苏联大使馆吊唁。许多少数民族的学员和干部，在学习斯大林关于民族问题的著作中，深深体会到斯大林的民族政策给苏联各族人民带来的幸福，增加了他们建设祖国和保卫和平的信心与力量。
    中央戏剧学院师生，听到斯大林同志逝世的消息后，当晚便集会追悼。
    中国矿业学院全院师生员工一千余人集会举行了哀悼仪式。
    北京市政法学院全体学工人员来信说：我们谨对敬爱的斯大林同志的不幸逝世，表示深切的哀悼。今后定要更加努力地完成我们的教学任务，学习斯大林同志的精神和科学理论，向敬爱的斯大林同志指引的道路前进。
    北京市第十五中学全体教师、学生、职员和工友在六日下午，以极其悲痛的心情集会追悼。会后，师生员工都纷纷订立了自己的工作和学习计划。
    北京戏曲实验学校全体同学来信说：我们全体同学以万分沉痛的心情哀悼斯大林同志的逝世。我们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，定要更加努力地学习，继承中国戏曲艺术的遗产，更好地服务于祖国的建设。
    北京师大附中三部少年儿童队员王成玉写道：
    当我们听到这不幸的消息的时候，我们的心像刀割一样的难受哇！我们都哭得抬不起头了，眼泪像雨一样流下来，湿透了胸前的红领巾。我们悲痛，我们难过……。但我们看到了红领巾，我们懂得了，应该把悲痛化为力量，斯大林不会死，他永远活在我们每一个人的心底。
    我要搞好祖国人民交给我的任务——学习。上学期，我的学习由不及格进步到消灭了不及格，由只有一门功课是四分的学习成绩进步到一半功课达到五分，但我决不满足，我要更加努力学习，争取全部达到五分。
    为了祖国的事业，为了斯大林的事业，我要努力成为斯大林所培养的英雄——卓娅一样的人。
