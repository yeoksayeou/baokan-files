Telegram of Condolences from the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

To the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party:

We were deeply saddened to hear of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Klement Gottwald, the beloved leader of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Czechoslovak people. We extend our deepest condolences to you, with extreme grief, on behalf of all Communist Party members and people of Liaoxi Province, China. Comrade Gottwald was a loyal student of Comrades Lenin and Stalin, a close friend of the Chinese people, and an outstanding fighter for the cause of world peace and democracy. He made enormous contributions to the cause of world peace and democracy. His passing is an irreplaceable loss to the Czechoslovak people and to the entire world peace and democracy camp. All Communist Party members and people of Liaoxi Province, China, will, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, further strengthen the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples, strengthen the unity of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, redouble our efforts, heighten our vigilance, and fight to the end to defend the cause of world peace and democracy.

Eternal glory to Comrade Gottwald!

                            The Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
