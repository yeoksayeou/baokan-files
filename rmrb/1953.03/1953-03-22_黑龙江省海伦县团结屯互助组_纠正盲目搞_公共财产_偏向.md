    Heilongjiang Province, Hailun County, Tuanjie Village Mutual Aid Group
    Correcting the Tendency of Blindly Pursuing "Public Property"
    In Tuanjie Village, Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, the mutual aid group experienced a tendency to blindly pursue "public property," which has now been corrected.
    The foundation of mutual aid and cooperation in Tuanjie Village is not yet strong. Among the nineteen mutual aid groups organized in the village, most are temporary groups consisting of two or three households, with only three permanent mutual aid groups. One of these three permanent groups was established only last autumn, and the other two have only about a year of mutual aid experience. These three mutual aid groups need to accumulate more experience before they can develop into more advanced organizational forms. However, the activists in these three groups were eager to organize an agricultural production cooperative. When the leadership did not approve, they vigorously pursued "public property" in an attempt to create an agricultural production cooperative "in reality but not in name." In addition to valuing and collectivizing all the carts, horses, and farm implements of the group members, the three groups also purchased one or two sets of rubber-tired carts on credit from the supply and marketing cooperative. As a result, each group had two or three tens of millions of yuan in "public property" and owed one or two hundred million yuan in debt. The payment for the "public property" was to be shared by each household according to its land area. Consequently, except for a very few wealthy households with more carts and horses who could recoup some money, everyone was in debt. Wang Xing and Ji Youliang, members of the Liu Chunlin Mutual Aid Group, handed over all the grain they harvested last year, which was not enough to pay off their share of the "public property" debt. In this way, everyone became a debtor to "public property."
    Now, with the specific assistance of the work team of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the tendency of these three mutual aid groups in Tuanjie Village has been corrected. The method is as follows: After explaining the principles and clearing up their thinking, the carts and horses are returned to their original owners, and the external debt is paid off in installments. To prevent the few households with more carts and horses from suffering losses, a system of mutual benefit and compensation for damage to carts and horses has been established.

### 黑龙江省海伦县团结屯互助组  纠正盲目搞“公共财产”偏向

    黑龙江省海伦县团结屯互助组
    纠正盲目搞“公共财产”偏向
    黑龙江省海伦县团结屯互助组发生盲目搞“公共财产”的偏向，现在已被纠正。
    团结屯的互助合作基础还不算好。全村组织起来的十九个互助组，多数是两三户组成的临时互助组，只有三个常年互助组。这三个常年互助组中，一个组是去年秋天才成立的，另两个也还只有一年左右的互助经验。这三个互助组要向更高级的组织形式发展，还需要积累一些经验才有可能。但这三个组的积极分子却急于组织农业生产合作社，领导上不批准，就大搞“公共财产”希图搞成个“有实无名”的农业生产合作社。三个组除了把组里农民的车、马、农具一律作价归公外，又分别向供销合作社赊购了一两台胶轮大车。这样，每个组都搞了两三千万元的“公共财产”和欠了一两百万元的债务。购买“公共财产”的账款，规定由各户按土地面积来分摊。结果，除极少数车马多的富裕户能找进来一些钱外，大家都负了债。柳春林互助组的组员王兴、纪有良两户把去年所打的粮食全部交出，都不够偿付摊派给自己的“公共财产”债款。这样，使大家都成了“公共财产”的债务人。
    现在团结屯这三个互助组的偏向，已在中共黑龙江省委工作组的具体帮助下得到纠正。办法是：经过说明道理，打通思想后，车马仍归原主所有，外债分期付清；为了不使少数车马多的户吃亏，又制订了两利制度和车马损坏时的赔偿办法。    （新华社）
