Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: The North China Administrative Committee's Construction Engineering Bureau convened a joint meeting of the heads of construction engineering bureaus from various provinces and cities and the managers of North China direct engineering companies in late February. Based on the spirit of the National Construction Engineering Work Conference, this meeting formulated a plan of management measures necessary to ensure the completion of tasks on schedule. It particularly focused on studying the serious idling problem that would be caused by projects not starting on time and in full.

Currently, many projects in the North China region cannot start on time due to incomplete designs. It is estimated that in the second half of March and the first half of April, the region will have 19,000 to 26,000 workers idling, and in the second half of April, there may still be 3,200 workers idling. The meeting studied the main reasons for the delay in design, including: the late determination of this year's project tasks; incomplete data provided by construction units; the weakness of the design departments' own survey and measurement capabilities; and slow review of project planning mission statements and designs.

Based on the above situation, the meeting decided that in project arrangements, the order of the original planned arrangements should be appropriately changed according to the design and construction preparation status. All localities must seize the opportunity to organize preparations for unfinished projects and new projects with the necessary conditions and start them on schedule. Projects originally scheduled for the first phase but not yet designed should immediately undergo intensive design efforts, striving for staggered early construction. Regarding labor allocation, before long-term workers and seasonal workers are fully utilized, the recruitment of temporary workers should, in principle, be halted. Regions and construction units with small tasks and large construction forces should allocate surplus forces to regions, construction units, or factory and mining capital construction units lacking construction forces. Regarding design, the meeting decided that each province and city, under the leadership of the Financial Committee, should absorb participation from relevant departments and establish a unified joint office system for review and management to simplify procedures and shorten design review time. Typical drawings and old drawings should be utilized as much as possible; for projects with simple structures and easy design, intensive design efforts should be made to complete them ahead of schedule.

    华北区召开会议研究解决严重窝工问题
    【新华社十日讯】华北行政委员会建筑工程局在二月下旬召开各省市建筑工程局长和华北直属工程公司经理联席会议。这次会议，根据全国建筑工程工作会议精神，拟定了为保证按期完成任务所必须采取的管理措施计划，并特别着重研究了由于工程不能按期全部开工势将造成的严重窝工问题。
    目前华北区有很多工程因尚未设计，不能及时开工，因此估计在三月下半月和四月上半月，全区将有一万九千至两万六千多工人窝工，四月下半月仍可能有三千二百个工人窝工。会议研究了迟迟不能设计的主要原因是：今年工程任务确定较迟；建设单位提出的资料多不完备；设计部门本身勘察、测量力量薄弱；工程计划任务书和设计的审核迟缓。
    根据以上情况，会议决定：在工程安排上应根据设计与施工准备情况，适当地改变原计划安排的次序，各地对未完工程和条件具备的新工程，必须抓紧组织准备，按期开工；原排在第一期但尚未设计的工程，立即紧张进行设计，争取陆续提前施工。在劳动调配上，各地在长期工和季节工未充分使用前，原则上停止招收临时工人；任务小，施工力量大的地区和施工单位，以多余力量调拨施工力量不足的地区、施工单位或厂矿基本建设单位。关于设计方面，会议决定：各省市在财委领导下，吸收各有关部门参加，建立统一的审核管理联合办公制度，以简化手续，缩短设计审核时间。尽量利用典型图、旧图；结构简单易于设计的工程，应突击设计，提前完成。
