Self-Criticism of the Error of Blindly Directing Commissioned Processing
Wuhan Municipal Finance and Economics Committee

A letter from the Wuhan Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee states: We fully agree with the criticism published in the People's Daily on January 23rd, "Wuhan Department Store Blindly Commissions Handicraft Processing Under the Erroneous Instructions of the Municipal Finance Committee and the Industry and Commerce Bureau, Resulting in a Large Accumulation of Socks and Towels." The course of events is as follows: In October 1950, when the nationwide unified purchase of cotton yarn was implemented, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from purchasing cotton yarn for speculation and to ensure the normal production of handicrafts such as socks, towels, and woven fabrics, it was decided to organize all of the aforementioned handicrafts for commissioned processing. After July 1952, the Wuhan Department Store realized that the commissioned socks and towels were of poor quality and accumulated in large quantities, so they proposed to no longer commission processing and automatically stopped doing so. As a result, most workers became unemployed, and some people complained, "During the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, you (referring to the cadres from the department store who investigated materials during the Three-Anti campaign) only asked us to boldly expose [problems], guaranteeing that we would not lose our jobs and would have processing work in the future. After the Five-Anti campaign, we became unemployed." In this emergency situation, we decided that the department store should still commission 70% of the processing. In August and September, we discovered that there were significant problems and decided to modify the machines to improve quality, with a portion commissioned by the Hubei Province and Wuhan City Department Stores. Although the quality and sales improved somewhat afterward, the inferior goods (socks) processed over the past year or so had been accumulated for a long time and in large quantities, and had not been completely sold.

The main reason for the serious accumulation of these processed goods is that we did not conduct responsible investigation and research or supervision and inspection work. We did not conduct accurate surveys and statistics on the sales of socks, towels, etc. in Wuhan. We were not clear about what styles of socks were needed and how much was needed. We simply blindly believed that the supply of cotton yarn was a serious problem and that the sales of cotton products would not be too difficult, and that as long as they were organized, long-term processing could be guaranteed. During the long period after processing, there was a lack of responsible inspection of the department store's management, and we only realized the seriousness of the accumulation of processed goods during the Three-Anti campaign.

Secondly, such a compulsory concentration of handicrafts for long-term and complete processing, without considering the conditions and violating objective economic circumstances by changing seasonal production to year-round production, was also a major error. This not only caused the accumulation of state funds, but also resulted in many complaints and dissatisfaction.

From this incident, it can be seen that there is a certain degree of one-sidedness in our policy thinking. We only paid attention to processing, but did not check and handle sales; after the Three-Anti campaign, we found that the accumulation of socks and towels was serious, and although we paid attention to improving quality and specifications, we did not actively find ways to open up sales channels for the accumulated goods in the past in a timely manner.

Of course, there are also many shortcomings in trade work, such as not combining processing, prices, and commodity turnover, adopting the viewpoint of "completing the tasks assigned by the higher authorities" and opposing it to business operations, and not constantly studying market changes and needs to improve processing and open up sales channels. This is also one of the main reasons for the serious accumulation of processed goods.

In the autumn of 1952, we conducted a more in-depth investigation and research and found that there were two problems: first, the quality and specifications were low and did not meet market needs; second, the method of contracting for commissioned processing, due to the limitations of the city department store market, was indeed difficult for the company. Therefore, we decided to study and solve these two aspects. In order to improve quality and specifications, a working group of more than 20 cadres was organized to go to the factories separately to supervise and set deadlines for machine modification. Those that were modified were decided to continue to be commissioned by the city department store wholesale station for a portion of the processing; the rest that could not be processed were organized to produce and sell themselves, and the original sock market was restored, and private merchants were mobilized to promote sales in the countryside. In recent months, the quality of socks has been greatly improved, and five factories have embarked on self-production and self-sales, and production and sales have returned to normal. We believe that this is the right thing to do. Now we are preparing to conduct another in-depth inspection, and according to the business needs of the city department store wholesale station and the yarn and cloth company, we will appropriately reduce a portion of the processing, and organize most of them to produce and sell themselves; those concentrated for production are allowed to disperse production according to the principle of voluntariness, self-production and self-sales, and in the past, it was slack in the off-season and busy in the peak season, and now it can still be the same. At the same time, we will strictly check the quality and specifications of the processed socks and towels, supervise and improve production, and according to sales, ensure as much as possible that there will be no more accumulation in the future; the accumulated socks are prepared to be sold in Hubei, Henan and other places in the spring.

    检讨盲目指示委托加工的错误
    武汉市财政经济委员会
    武汉市人民政府财政经济委员会来信称：我们完全同意一月二十三日人民日报所载“武汉市百货公司在市财委和工商局的错误指示下盲目委托手工业加工积压大批袜子毛巾”的批评。事情的经过是这样的：一九五○年十月间全国棉纱统购，为了避免奸商套购棉纱从事投机经营，并保证袜子、毛巾、织布等手工业的正常生产，决定将上述手工业全部组织起来委托加工。至一九五二年七月份以后，武汉市百货公司发觉委托加工的袜子、毛巾因品质很差，积压很多，提出不再委托加工的要求并自动停止了委托加工，因之大部工人陷于失业，有的人不满意地说：“三反、五反时你们（指百货公司在三反时去调查材料的干部）只要我们大胆检举，保证以后不失业有加工，五反后我们失业了。”在此紧急情况下，我们又决定仍由百货公司委托加工百分之七十。到八、九月份我们发现存在的问题很大，决定改装机器，提高品质，由湖北省、武汉市百货公司委托加工一部分。以后虽然品质和销路有所改进，但过去一年多加工的次货（袜子）因积压时间很长，数量很大，仍没有全部销出。
    造成这些加工品严重积压的主要原因，是我们没有进行认真负责的调查研究和督促检查工作。对武汉市袜子、毛巾等的销路，事前没有作精确的调查统计。需要什么样式的袜子？需要量多少？都不清楚。只是盲目地认为棉纱供应是严重的问题，棉制品的销路不会困难太大，只要组织起来即可保证长期加工。加工后的长期时间，对百货公司的经营管理又缺乏负责的检查，直到三反我们才发觉加工品积压问题的严重。
    其次，这样带强迫性地把手工业集中起来长期全部加工，不看条件，违反客观经济情况地变季节性生产为全年生产，也是很大的错误。这不仅造成国家资金的积压，而且还招致很多怨言与不满。
    从这件事情可以看出我们的政策思想上也存在一定程度的片面性。我们只注意加工，而没有检查与处理销路；三反后我们发现袜子、毛巾积压情况严重后，虽然注意了品质规格的改进，但没有及时积极设法为过去积压的商品打开销路。
    当然在贸易工作方面也存在不少缺点，如没有把加工、价格、商品周转结合起来，采用了“完成上级任务”的观点和业务经营相对立，不去经常研究市场变化和需要来改进加工打开销路等。这也是造成加工品严重积压的主要原因之一。
    一九五二年秋季，我们进行了比较深入的调查研究，发现存在着两个问题：第一是品质规格低劣，不合市场需要；第二是包下来委托加工这一办法，因市百货公司市场的限制，该公司也的确有困难。因之，我们即决定从这两方面研究解决。为了改进品质规格，组织了一个二十余名干部的工作组，分别下厂督促、限期改装机器。改装了的，决定仍由市百货批发站继续委托加工一部分；其余不能加工的，组织其自产自销，并恢复原来的袜子市场，动员私商下乡推销。近几月来，袜子的品质已大大改进，有五个厂已走上自产自销，产销也恢复正常。我们认为这样做是正确的。现在我们准备再作一次深入的检查，根据市百货批发站和花纱布公司的业务需要，再适当减少一部分加工，大部组织其自产自销；集中在一起生产的按自愿原则允许分散生产，自产自销，过去淡停旺开，现在仍可照旧。同时严格检查加工的袜子、毛巾的品质规格，督促改进生产，根据销路，尽可能保证以后再不积压；已积压的袜子准备在春季到湖北、河南等地销出。
