    Consumer Cooperatives Should Not Absorb Capitalists

    According to readers' reports, some consumer cooperatives in Harbin are absorbing capitalists as members in pursuit of profits, which has caused dissatisfaction among the vast majority of members. The owner of Yifengtai Electric Noodle Factory in Xifujia District of the city was absorbed as a member by the district's consumer cooperative. The flour used by this noodle factory to make noodles is supplied by the cooperative at preferential prices. Similar situations exist in other consumer cooperatives in Harbin. More seriously, some consumer cooperatives even take the initiative to supply private merchants with flour on credit in order to stimulate their investment. On December 14 last year, the third distribution branch of Xifujia District supplied "Lao Ding Feng" Food Store with 40 bags of flour at a price lower than the listed price.

    Consumer cooperatives are economic organizations of urban working people. Their task is to do their best to supply various inexpensive daily necessities according to the needs of their members, so as to improve the lives of consumers. Therefore, its business policy should be to serve the members, and should never be for the sole purpose of making profits. The object of its membership development should be the working people, not the capitalists. It is obviously wrong for some consumer cooperatives in Harbin to violate this principle.

    The above situation shows that many grassroots cooperative cadres in Harbin have not really understood the nature of cooperatives. If this situation continues, the cooperatives are in danger of deteriorating. It also shows that the Harbin Municipal United Cooperative's ideological leadership over lower-level cooperatives is still very weak, which has led to such a principled mistake. The leading cadres of the Harbin Municipal United Cooperative must seriously examine their own policies and business ideas, and take appropriate and effective measures to correct this mistake.

    消费合作社不应吸收资本家
    据读者反映，哈尔滨市某些消费合作社为了追求利润，竟吸收资本家为社员，引起广大社员群众的不满。该市西傅家区义丰泰电机挂面厂的老板被该区消费合作社吸收为社员，这个挂面厂做挂面所用的面粉，都是由合作社按照优待价格供应的。类似情况在哈尔滨市其它消费合作社中同样存在。更严重的是，有些消费合作社为了刺激私商入股，竟主动地赊给私商面粉。该市西傅家区第三分销社在去年十二月十四日一次即以低于牌价的价格，赊给“老鼎丰”食品店四十袋面粉。
    消费合作社是城市劳动人民的经济组织，它的任务是根据社员群众的需要，尽力供给各种廉价的生活必需品，以便改善消费者的生活。因此，它的经营方针应该是为社员群众服务，绝不应当以单纯营利为目的。它发展社员的对象应当是劳动人民，而不应该发展资本家。哈尔滨市某些消费合作社违背了这种原则，显然是错误的。
    上述情况说明，哈尔滨市不少基层合作社的干部，还没有真正懂得合作社的性质，这种情况如果继续下去，合作社就有变质的危险；也说明了哈尔滨市联合社对下级社的思想领导还是十分薄弱，以致发生了这种原则性的错误。哈尔滨市联合社的领导干部必须严肃地检查自己的政策思想和经营思想，采取适当的有效的办法，纠正这种错误。
