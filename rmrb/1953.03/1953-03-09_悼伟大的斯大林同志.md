    In Mourning of the Great Comrade Stalin
    Song Qingling
    I write this with the deepest sorrow. Because just over a month ago, I had the opportunity to see Comrade Stalin again. He was hale and hearty, full of energy. Seeing him like that, I was happy in my heart. At that time, I thought Comrade Stalin could still serve the people of the world for many years to come.

    But now I am faced with the fact of the unfortunate death of our leader. This makes my heart very heavy. All of our people feel very sorrowful. When the sad news came, everyone was sad and wept. I heard someone say, "I feel just like I have lost my dearest parents."

    All progressive humanity has suffered a great loss as a result.

    We have lost a genius of revolutionary art, one who has been tempered in long-term struggles, possessing an indomitable fighting spirit, adhering to principles, and waging a relentless struggle against all oppressors. In Stalin's heart, burned such a fierce revolutionary flame that he had only one creed in life: to serve the people. How loyal he was to the people! How loyal he was to the revolution – not only liberating his own people but also pointing the way for all oppressed people everywhere! In the early days of the revolution, wherever difficulties arose, wherever there was a possibility of a breakthrough by the enemy, Lenin sent Stalin. And because of his calm analysis, his wisdom and brilliant decisions, his methods of overcoming all difficulties, he was always victorious. How correctly Stalin continued Lenin's cause! For so many years, from his office in the Kremlin, he not only led the Soviet people in construction, safeguarding all of humanity and the future of all humanity, but his daily work also showed great concern for any oppressed people, no matter how far away they were. This concern was boundless, making all people know that the proletarian brotherly love pulsating in that heart would always support them. It gave courage to those who were fighting with only bare hands; it provided ways to repel and even defeat the enemy when the enemy was about to win. This made Stalin our closest friend, our teacher, our comrade, and our leader.

    We have lost a greatest defender of peace. How enthusiastically and powerfully he inspired the construction of a new society, planned steps towards universal prosperity, developed human wisdom to new heights, and devoted all his efforts to cultivating and promoting construction. Stalin taught the world a new way of life, to be sincere and faithful, frank and straightforward, to give equality to all nations, men and women, all countries, and to place relations between countries on an unprecedented level of friendship. He declared that as long as the people of the world take up the cause of defending peace and persevere to the end, peace can be saved. This call gave unparalleled inspiration to all people who desire peace.

    Yes, our loss is immense. But, dear Soviet friends, dear comrades in our country, and people everywhere in the world, Stalin has not left us unarmed on our road forward. He has prepared us to continue forward, to realize the most precious hopes cherished by his predecessors and himself, with the achievements of his life and entire work.

    He has forged the Communist Party of the Soviet Union into steel tempered a hundred times. Stalin said that Lenin taught us that only those leaders who not only know how to educate workers and peasants but also know how to learn from workers and peasants can become truly Bolshevik leaders. Stalin not only took this lesson as the true foundation of his life, constantly setting an example of contact with the masses, but he also elevated it to a new height. He had unwavering confidence in the people and the invincible power of the people in the face of all enemies. He engaged in Party work with such a tradition. This ensures that the cause founded by Lenin and inherited by Stalin will be continued and implemented by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, reaching its historical conclusion.

    Stalin not only had confidence in his own people but also had the same confidence in all people. He repeatedly stated that the path experienced by the Soviet people will be followed by all other people as well. I clearly remember what he first said to me on January 13th this year, "The Chinese people are good people." What he meant was that the Chinese people are a heroic people, just like the Soviet people, capable of enduring the most arduous tests, performing miracles and winning victories. Both great peoples are capable of enduring struggles of self-sacrifice, making the greatest sacrifices for humanity, preserving civilization and elevating it to a new height. His confidence in the Chinese people is precisely an inseparable part of the international working-class movement that he forged for the liberation of all laborers and for the national independence of all colonial peoples from imperialist rule. Every word of his is proven by facts. The Chinese people will never forget that his assistance never wavered for a single moment during our years of struggle against foreign imperialism and domestic feudal warlord forces. Stalin forged the working people of the world into the most solid unity with such confidence and action, which will inevitably withstand all tests and achieve final victory.

    We who trust in Stalin and his cause must take up the struggle from now on. We must temper ourselves with the heavy grief we feel today and strengthen our iron will. We must engrave Stalin's teachings in our hearts. We must take Stalin's thoughts as a driving force. We must take Stalin's greatness as our own standard for serving the people. We must use Stalin's courage to inspire ourselves to overcome all difficulties in our progress.

    This is the beginning of a new stage in our struggle for progress. This does not mark the end of a period but a new high point, from which we will rise to a higher level. The victory that Stalin achieved is the foundation for all humanity to strive for freedom and happiness. We should take up the cause he left behind and forge ahead courageously.

    All progressive humanity must be vigilant. We must unite around Stalin's Party and the great Soviet people. We must reaffirm our determination to dedicate ourselves, absorb the spirit of Stalin's life and work, implement our tasks with Stalinist work style, and wholeheartedly strive for victory.

    The struggle of the world working class will inevitably be victorious. Let us advance with the slogan "For Stalin"!

    悼伟大的斯大林同志
    宋庆龄
    我以最沉痛的心情来写这篇文字。因为仅仅一个多月前我有机会再见到斯大林同志，他是健硕矍铄，精神饱满的。见到他这样，我心中高兴。那时我想，斯大林同志还能为世界人民服务好多年啊。
    但是现在我所面对着的是我们领袖的不幸逝世的事实。这使我的心头非常沉重。我们全国人民都感觉非常沉痛。当噩耗传来时，所有人都悲伤流泪，我听到有人说，“我感觉正像失去了我最亲爱的父母一样。”
    全体进步人类因此而遭受到一个巨大的损失。
    我们失去了一位在长期斗争中经过千锤百炼，有着不屈不挠的斗志，坚持原则，对一切压迫者进行无情斗争的革命艺术的天才。在斯大林的心中，燃烧着如此炽烈的革命的火焰，因而使他只有一个生活的信条：为人民服务。他是如何地忠于人民啊！他是如何地忠于革命啊——不仅使他自己的人民获得解放，而且给所有地方一切被压迫的人民指出了道路！在革命初期，那里发生了困难，那里有了被敌人突破的可能，列宁就派了斯大林去。而由于他的冷静分析，他的睿智和英明的决断，他的克服一切困难的方法，他总是胜利的。斯大林是多么正确地继续着列宁的事业啊！这许多年来，从他在克里姆林宫的办公室里，他不仅领导着苏联人民进行建设，保障了全人类与全人类的未来，而且他的每日的工作还显示着对于任何被压迫人民的极大关怀，不管他们是在多么远的地方。这种关怀是无远弗届的，它使所有的人们都知道在那颗心中所搏动着的无产阶级的兄弟友爱将会永远支持着他们。它使只有赤手空拳在斗争着的人都得到了勇气；它在敌人差一点就可以获得胜利的时候，还是提供了办法来打退敌人以至战胜敌人。这使得斯大林成为我们最亲密的朋友，我们的导师，我们的同志和领袖。
    我们失去了一位最伟大的和平保卫者。他是多么热情磅礴地鼓舞着一个新社会的建设，规划着走向普遍繁荣的步骤，使人类的智慧发展到新的高峰，而把他的一切努力都用在培育和推动建设方面。斯大林以一种新的生活方式教导世界，要诚恳和忠实，坦白和率直，使一切民族、男子和女子、一切国家都得到平等，把各国之间的关系放在一个空前未有的友好水平上。他宣告着世界人民只要把保卫和平的事业担当起来，而且坚持到底，和平就能够得救。这个号召给与所有要求和平的人民以无比伟大的鼓舞。
    是的，我们的损失是巨大的。但是，亲爱的苏联朋友们，亲爱的我们国内同志们，以及世界一切地方的人们，斯大林并不是在我们前进的道路上毫不留给我们以武装而离开我们的。他已经把他一身和整个工作的成就，给我们准备着继续前进，去实现他的先行者和他自己所怀抱的最宝贵的希望。
    他已经把苏联共产党锤锻得成为百炼之钢。斯大林说，列宁教导我们，只有那些不仅知道如何教育工人和农民而且也知道向工农学习的领袖们，才能成为真正布尔什维克的领袖。斯大林不仅把这教训作为他生活的真正基础，经常树立和群众接触的榜样，而且他把这提到了新的高度。他对于人民以及人民在一切敌人面前的不可战胜的力量，有着坚持不渝的信心。他以这样的传统来从事党的工作。这就保证着列宁所创始的和斯大林所继承的事业，一定能由苏联共产党继续贯彻，达到它历史的结论。
    斯大林不仅对于他自己的人民有着信心，而且对于一切人民具有同样的信心。他一再说明，苏联人民所经历的道路，所有其他人民都会同样经过。我清楚地记得本年一月十三日他最初对我讲的话，“中国人民是好人民。”他的意思是说，中国人民是一个英勇的人民，正像苏联人民一样，能够经受最艰苦的考验，作出奇迹而获得胜利，这两大人民都能够忍受自我牺牲的斗争，为人类作最大的牺牲，保全了文明而且把它提到一个新的高度。他对于中国人民的信心，正是他为了所有劳动者的解放、为了所有殖民地人民从帝国主义统治下争取民族独立而锻炼着国际工人阶级运动的不可分的环节的一部分。他的每一句话都有事实证明。中国人民将永不会忘记在多年来我们对外国帝国主义与国内封建主义军阀势力的斗争中，他的援助从没有丝毫片刻动摇过。斯大林以这样的信心和行动把世界劳动人民熔合成一个最坚固的团结，这必然会经受一切考验，取得最后胜利。
    我们信赖着斯大林和他的事业的人们，必须从此把斗争担当起来。我们必须把今天我们感到的沉重的悲痛来锻炼自己，加强我们钢铁一样的意志。我们必须把斯大林的教训铭刻在心上。我们必须把斯大林的思想作为一个发动力。我们必须把斯大林的伟大作为我们自己为人民服务的标准。我们必须把斯大林的勇敢来激励自己，冲破一切前进中的困难。
    这是我们为进步而斗争的一个新阶段的开始。这不是标志着一个时期的终结，而是一个新的高点，由此我们将升到更高的水平。斯大林所完成的胜利正是全人类争取自由与幸福的基础。我们应该把他遗留下的事业拿起来，奋勇前进。
    全体进步人类必须提高警惕。我们必须团结在斯大林的党和伟大的苏联人民周围。我们必须重申献出我们自己的决心，吸取斯大林的一身和他工作的精神，以斯大林式的工作来贯彻我们的任务，全心全意为着胜利而努力。
    世界工人阶级的斗争必然会得到胜利，让我们高呼着“为了斯大林”的口号前进！
