    French "l'Humanité" Publishes Editorial
    Demanding the UN Immediately Ban Germ Warfare
    Xinhua News Agency: The French newspaper "l'Humanité" published an editorial on February 27th stating that the confessions of captured American Air Force officers Colonel Huble and Major Blais, coupled with the report released by the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea concerning the American conduct of germ warfare, have fully revealed to the world the heinous war crimes committed by the American aggressors in Korea.

    The editorial continued: "It is imperative to demand that the United Nations discuss the issue of banning the use of bacteriological weapons. It is no accident that the United States refuses to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons. The United States wants to continue to use bacteriological weapons at will. However, universal condemnation can and must compel the United Nations to take a stand. In France, we must first condemn our government and all those who condone the crimes committed by the United States in Korea, crimes that are even more heinous than those committed by the Nazis." The editorial concluded by calling for an immediate ban on germ warfare and declaring bacteriological weapons illegal.

    法国“人道报”发表社论
    要求联合国立即禁止细菌战
    据新华社讯：法国“人道报”二月二十七日发表社论说：被俘美国空军军官许威布尔上校和布莱少校的供词，再加上朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线的报告中所发表的美国进行细菌战的情况，使全世界充分地看到了美国侵略者在朝鲜所犯的穷凶极恶的战争罪行。
    社论接着说：“必须要求联合国讨论禁止使用细菌武器问题。美国拒绝批准禁止使用细菌武器的一九二五年日内瓦议定书不是偶然的。美国要想继续随意地使用细菌武器。但是普遍的谴责能够而且一定要使联合国采取一种立场。我们在法国必须首先谴责我们的政府以及一切附和美国在朝鲜所犯罪行的人，这些罪行比纳粹所犯的罪行还要凶恶。”社论最后要求立即禁止细菌战并宣布细菌武器为非法。
