    The Immortal Volunteer Air Force Hero Sun Shenglu
    Jiao Jingwen, Hou Zupei

    On December 12, 1952, the leadership of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force issued a commendation order, posthumously awarding Sun Shenglu, squadron leader of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force, the honorary title of "First-Class Combat Hero" and posthumously awarding him a special merit citation for shooting down six enemy planes and damaging one.

    Heroic Chinese son, loyal friend of the Korean people—Comrade Sun Shenglu was a native of Fangshang Village, Dingxing County, Hebei Province. He was twenty-five years old when he gave his precious life for the Chinese and Korean people.

    Long after the Japanese imperialists invaded North China, the young Sun Shenglu resolutely took up a gun and joined the anti-Japanese ranks. In one battle, his gun suddenly failed to fire. At that time, two Japanese bandits charged at him with bayonets. But Sun Shenglu did not fear. Like millions of unyielding Chinese people, he bravely stood up, jumped out of the fortifications, and charged at the enemy with his bayonet. The enemy in front, seeing that he was short, walked towards him with a contemptuous look. Sun Shenglu immediately rushed towards the enemy and engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand combat, bravely stabbing the enemy down. At this time, all the comrades-in-arms rushed over, and the remaining enemies, seeing the situation was not good, turned around and ran. From then on, Sun Shenglu was a fearless warrior.

    After Sun Shenglu joined the Volunteer Army Air Force, under the education and cultivation of the Party, his outstanding qualities were further revealed. He loved the motherland and the Korean people. When he first flew over the Korean sky, he could not see a single complete city or village on the ground. He felt an inextinguishable anger in his heart and bravely plunged into the battle to strike the American aerial bandits.

    Sun Shenglu trained to become a staunch aerial warrior in battle. He was good at overcoming enemy attacks with great courage and at defeating enemy tricks with unparalleled resourcefulness.

    On November 15, 1952, Sun Shenglu and his comrades discovered two enemy planes at high altitude in a certain area of Korea. His eagle-like sharp eyes quickly saw that the auxiliary fuel tanks of these two enemy planes had not been dropped. This was a good opportunity to strike the enemy planes. He immediately led his wingman skillfully around to the rear of these two enemy planes, preparing to catch them off guard. Just as he was about to attack the enemy plane, he suddenly heard a report from wingman pilot Ma Lianyu in his earphones:

    "Attention! Two more enemy planes are following behind!"

    In fact, when Sun Shenglu discovered the two enemy planes in front, he considered that there might be enemy planes behind. But since the enemy planes in front had not dropped their auxiliary fuel tanks, they obviously had not discovered us, and this was an opportunity that could not be abandoned. He quickly scanned the rear and saw that the enemy planes behind had just dropped their auxiliary fuel tanks, their altitude was lower than our planes, and they were still far from Ma Lianyu, so they could not catch up for a while. Therefore, he ordered Ma Lianyu to monitor the enemy planes behind, while he still quickly rushed towards the enemy plane in front and opened fire on it. This enemy plane immediately dived down. The remaining enemy plane, like a wild beast hearing gunfire, hurriedly dropped its auxiliary fuel tank and fled.

    Sun Shenglu did not bother to look at the enemy plane that was shot down, but immediately turned around and began a fierce attack on the two enemy planes behind. These two enemy planes, which were preparing to attack Ma Lianyu, could not withstand Sun Shenglu's courageous attack, and hurriedly turned their heads and fled south as well.

    In many battles, Sun Shenglu often forgot everything about himself to save his comrades in danger.

    On December 2nd of last year, Sun Shenglu and his wingman pilot Ma Lianyu were responsible for covering Air Force Hero Wang Hai's flight leader group in launching an attack on enemy planes. Just as Wang Hai's flight leader group was chasing two enemy planes and was about to start firing, suddenly, four F-86 enemy planes rushed towards Wang Hai's flight leader group like madmen. They attempted to ambush Wang Hai's flight leader group and rescue the bandits who were about to be shot down. At this time, in order for Sun Shenglu to cover the flight leader group's safe attack on the enemy, he had to quickly turn his plane head-on towards the enemy planes, disrupting the enemy's formation and drawing the enemy's attack towards himself. However, doing so was very dangerous, and it was easy to give the enemy planes a good opportunity to attack. Sun Shenglu did not have the slightest fear or hesitation. He forgot all the dangers. Encouraged by the high degree of class feeling that "enemies must never be allowed to harm our flight leader," he accurately and quickly turned his plane and, before the enemy could open fire, began a fierce attack on the four enemy planes rushing towards him.

    This sudden attack threw the enemy planes into confusion. In that instant, Wang Hai's flight leader group had escaped the danger and flew far away, closely pursuing the two enemy planes. However, these four enemy planes turned around and continued to pounce on Sun Shenglu. Sun Shenglu skillfully maneuvered the plane, resourcefully circled behind the enemy planes, and concentrated on searching for an opportunity to attack. After the four enemy planes followed him for two large circles, Sun Shenglu had already aimed at the enemy's number four plane. He fired a burst of shells fiercely, and this enemy plane immediately rolled and crashed. However, the enemy planes did not retreat. Relying on their numerical superiority, they turned around and continued to pounce on Sun Shenglu. Sun Shenglu had long anticipated this. Therefore, after he shot down the enemy's number four plane, he immediately forced his way towards the enemy's number three plane. Before the enemy's number three plane could turn around, Sun Shenglu's shells had already exploded in its fuselage.

    The next day—December 3rd—Sun Shenglu shot down another enemy plane and cooperated with his comrades to repel the enemy plane group that attempted to bomb the Korean people on a large scale. Not long after he safely returned, the enemy planes, enraged and humiliated by continuous defeats, attacked again. Hero Sun Shenglu immediately fought fiercely with his comrades against enemy planes that outnumbered them by more than four times. Sun Shenglu led his wingman pilot Ma Lianyu to press four enemy planes from an altitude of 12,000 meters to a low altitude of 1,500 meters. Just as he was about to severely punish these bandits, four more enemy planes came from the right rear and fired at him simultaneously. Sun Shenglu's plane was damaged, but he did not fear. He drove his damaged plane and rushed angrily towards the enemy planes that ambushed him. However, the severely damaged plane no longer obeyed his control. Our hero—the outstanding son of the Chinese people, the loyal friend of the Korean people—Sun Shenglu gloriously gave his precious life for the happy lives of the motherland and the Korean people, and for the lasting peace of the world.

    Sun Shenglu's glorious sacrifice in the Korean sky enraged his comrades who were engaged in a fierce battle. His close comrade-in-arms—wingman pilot Ma Lianyu—immediately shot down and damaged one of the enemy planes that killed Sun Shenglu. In a mood of anger to avenge Sun Shenglu, his comrades shot down and damaged six enemy planes in this battle.

    Sun Shenglu, the name of this outstanding air force hero and excellent member of the Communist Party of China, and his deeds, will be immortal!

    不朽的志愿军空军英雄孙生禄
    焦景文  侯祖沛
    一九五二年十二月十二日，中国人民志愿军空军领导机关颁发了一条嘉奖令，追赠先后击落敌机六架，击伤敌机一架的中国人民志愿军空军某部中队长孙生禄“一级战斗英雄”的光荣称号，并追记特等功一次。
    英雄的中华男儿、朝鲜人民的忠诚朋友——孙生禄同志，是河北省定兴县坊上村人。他为中朝人民献出他宝贵的生命的时候是二十五岁。
    远在日本帝国主义侵占我国华北之后，年青的孙生禄，便决然地拿起枪参加了抗日的队伍。在一次战斗里，他的枪突然打不响了。当时两个日本强盗端着刺刀向他冲来。但孙生禄并没有畏惧，他像千万不屈的中国人民一样，勇敢地站了起来，跳出工事，端着刺刀迎击敌人。最前面的一个敌人，看他个子矮，便带着轻蔑的神态向他走来。孙生禄马上向着敌人冲过去，同敌人展开了激烈的肉搏战，英勇地将敌人刺倒。这时，所有的战友们都赶来了，剩下的敌人见事不好，转身就跑。从那时候起，孙生禄便是一位无畏的战士。
    孙生禄参加志愿军空军后，在党的教导和培养下，越发显示出他的优秀品质。他热爱祖国、热爱朝鲜人民。当他第一次飞上朝鲜的天空时，看不到地面上有一个完整的城市和乡村，他心里燃烧起不可熄灭的怒火，勇敢地投入了打击美国空中强盗的战斗。
    孙生禄在战斗中锻炼成为一个坚强的空中战士，他善于以高度的勇敢战胜敌机的攻击，也善于以无比的机智来击败敌机的诡计。
    一九五二年十一月十五日，孙生禄和他的战友在朝鲜某地高空发现了两架敌机。他那鹰一样锐利的眼睛，迅速看出这两架敌机的副油箱还没有扔掉。这是一个打击敌机的很好机会。他立刻领着他的僚机巧妙地绕到这两架敌机的后面，准备打它个措手不及。就在他准备向敌机攻击时，突然耳机里传来僚机飞行员马连玉的报告：
    “注意！后面又跟上来两架敌机！”
    其实，在孙生禄发现前面的两架敌机时，他就考虑到：可能后面还有敌机。但是前面的敌机既然没有扔掉副油箱，显然是没有发现我们，这是不可放弃的战机。他迅速地向后面扫视了一下，看见后面的敌机刚把副油箱扔掉，高度低于我们的飞机，距离马连玉还远，一时是追不上来的。于是，他一面命令马连玉监视后面的敌机，一面仍然迅速地向着前面的一架敌机冲过去，并且向它开了炮。这架敌机马上栽了下去。剩下的一架敌机，像听到了枪声的野兽一样，慌慌张张地丢掉副油箱逃走了。
    孙生禄没有顾得看这架被击落的敌机，马上一个向后转，对着后面两架敌机开始了猛烈的射击。这两架准备向马连玉攻击的敌机，受不住孙生禄的勇猛攻击，急忙调转机头，也向着南方逃去了。
    在许多次战斗中，孙生禄常常忘掉自己的一切去挽救危难中的战友。
    去年十二月二日，孙生禄和他的僚机飞行员马连玉负责掩护空军英雄王海的长机组向敌机发起攻击。正当王海的长机组追击着两架敌机，并且马上就要开始射击的时候，突然，四架F八十六型敌机像发了疯似地向着王海的长机组冲来。它们企图偷袭王海的长机组，解救即将被击落的强盗。这时，孙生禄要掩护长机组安全地攻击敌人，必须迅速地急转机头对着敌机冲过去，打乱敌机的队形，把敌机的攻击吸引向自己。但是，这样作是很危险的，容易给敌机造成攻击的好机会。孙生禄没有丝毫畏惧和犹豫。他忘记了一切危险，在“决不许敌人伤害我们的长机”的高度阶级感情的鼓舞下，他精确而迅速地急转过机头，没等敌人开火，便向冲来的四架敌机开始了猛烈的射击。
    这突如其来的射击，使敌机慌乱了。就在这一刹那间，王海的长机组已脱离了危险，紧追着两架敌机飞远了。可是，这四架敌机却向着孙生禄攻来。孙生禄娴熟地操纵着飞机，机智地绕到敌机后面，一面撵着敌机转圈，一面聚精会神地寻找战机。当四架敌机跟随他转了两个大圈之后，孙生禄已经瞄准了敌人的四号飞机，他狠狠地打出了一串炮弹，这架敌机马上便翻滚着坠落下去。但是，敌机并没有退却，它们依仗着数量上的优势，又反转来继续扑向孙生禄。孙生禄早已预料到了这点，因此，在他击落敌人的四号机之后，又紧接着逼向敌人的三号机。敌人的三号机还没有反转过来，孙生禄的炮弹已经爆炸在它的机身里了。
    第二天——十二月三日，孙生禄又一次击落了一架敌机，并配合战友们打退了企图向朝鲜人民大肆轰炸的敌机机群。在他安全返航不久，连续惨败恼羞成怒的敌机又一次来袭了。英雄孙生禄，又马上同战友们一起同数量上超过自己四倍以上的敌机展开了激烈的战斗。孙生禄带领着僚机飞行员马连玉，把四架敌机从一万二千公尺的高空，直压到一千五百公尺低空。正当他要狠狠地惩罚这些强盗时，右后方又来了四架敌机，并且一齐向他射击起来。孙生禄驾驶的飞机受伤了，但他并没有畏惧，他驾驶着受了伤的飞机，怒不可遏地向着偷袭他的敌机冲去。可是，受了重伤的飞机，不再听他操纵了。我们的英雄——中国人民优秀的儿子、朝鲜人民忠实的朋友孙生禄，为着祖国和朝鲜人民的幸福生活，为着全世界的持久和平光荣地献出了他宝贵的生命。
    孙生禄光荣牺牲在朝鲜的天空，激怒了正在进行着激烈战斗的战友们。他亲密的战友——僚机飞行员马连玉马上便把杀害孙生禄的敌机击落、击伤各一架。在为孙生禄复仇的愤怒心情下，就在这次战斗中，他的战友们击落击伤了六架敌机。
    孙生禄，这位出色的空军英雄、中国共产党的优秀党员的名字和他的事迹，永垂不朽！
