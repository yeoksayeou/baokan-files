    A Matter That Concerns Them, Yet Still Shelved
    Drawn by Zhao Zhifang
    According to letters from readers Rong Chang and Wen Tao: In 1951, a train car (boxcar) of printed cloth transported from Manzhouli to within the passes caught fire suddenly between Jiangqiao and Daxing, under the jurisdiction of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau in Northeast China, and all the cloth was destroyed. However, even to this day, the owner of the goods is still unknown. The North China Warehouse Adjustment Committee Office, in order to clarify this loss of over 2 billion yuan and the serious neglect of state property that has gone uninvestigated for over a year, inquired about the owner to the Tianjin Railway Administration and the Qiqihar Railway Bureau separately in January of this year. The Qiqihar Railway Bureau replied: "The loss occurred over a year ago, and the railway bureau is no longer liable for compensation." The Business Office of the Tianjin Railway Administration said: "Because it is not known whether the station to which this train of printed cloth was sent belongs to the Tianjin Railway Administration, it is not convenient to inquire with the Qiqihar Bureau." We believe that both the Qiqihar Railway Bureau and the Tianjin Railway Administration have a responsibility to ascertain the truth of this matter regarding this serious damage to state property and should not sit idly by.

    事本关己，仍然挂起

    据读者荣昌、文滔来信说：一九五一年由满洲里运往关内的一车皮（棚车）花布，行至东北齐齐哈尔局所属江桥至大兴间突然失火，花布全部烧毁。但一直到目前还不知货主是谁。华北仓库调整委员会办公室为弄清这一损失约二十余亿元而时隔一年多竟无人追究的严重忽视国家资财的事件，在今年一月分别向天津铁路管理局和齐齐哈尔铁路局查问货主。齐齐哈尔铁路局的答复是：“该项损失已逾一年，路局已不负赔偿责任。”天津铁路管理局商务处却说：“因为不知道这车花布的发往站是否为天津铁路管理局所属，不便向齐齐哈尔局查询。”我们认为：对这种严重损害国家资财的事件，无论齐齐哈尔铁路局或天津铁路管理局，都有查明事实真相的责任，不应该坐视不理。
