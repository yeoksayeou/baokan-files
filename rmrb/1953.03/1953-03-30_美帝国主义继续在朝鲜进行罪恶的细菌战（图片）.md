US Imperialism Continues Its Heinous Germ Warfare in Korea

    Top Left: At 8:35 PM on December 29, 1952, an American plane dropped two germ bombs on Saishi Village, Fengxi Township, Yanbai County, on the west coast of Korea. Comrade Wang Zhanyuan, a volunteer soldier on guard duty, saw it clearly. He immediately reported to his superiors. The epidemic prevention team immediately went to the site for inspection. The picture shows the internal structure of the germ bomb dropped by the American plane.

    Bottom Left: There were flies, mosquitoes, poisonous insects, and other things near the place where the bomb fell. The epidemic prevention team is picking these things up in bottles to prepare for testing.

    Top Right: These are the flies, mosquitoes, and poisonous insects dropped by the enemy. These poisonous insects are different from those commonly seen locally, and are obviously cultivated by the enemy.

    Bottom Right: Soldier Wang Zhanyuan is describing in detail the circumstances of the enemy dropping the bomb here.

    美帝国主义继续在朝鲜进行罪恶的细菌战
    左上：一九五二年十二月二十九日晚上八点三十五分，美机一架在朝鲜西海岸延白郡凤西面赛时洞投下两枚细菌弹，当时被志愿军站岗的战士王占元同志看得清清楚楚。他马上报告上级。防疫小组立即到现地检查。图为美机投下的细菌弹的内部构造。
    左下：落弹的附近地方，有苍蝇、蚊子、毒虫等东西。防疫小组正在把这些东西拣在瓶子里，准备化验。
    右上：这就是敌人投下来的苍蝇、蚊子、毒虫。这些毒虫与当地通常见到的不一样，显然是敌人培养出来的。
    右下：战士王占元正在详细叙述敌人在这里投弹时的经过情形。
