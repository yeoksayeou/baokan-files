    Liu Yuhua and Fang Youhao
    Mo Ce
    In the spring of 1951, the masses in Linhai Township, Nancheng District, Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, responded to the government's call and launched a locust eradication campaign. Liu Yuhua, the daughter of a poor peasant in Heping Village, a strong and clever girl, was very active in the locust eradication campaign. People elected her as the group leader. While other groups were catching about ten or so jin of locusts per day, her group was always catching seventeen, eighteen, or even twenty jin. Because their group's performance was outstanding, Fang Youhao, the Heping Village militia platoon leader and locust eradication team squad leader, focused on leading them, using them as a force to drive the entire squad forward. Work often brought Fang Youhao and Liu Yuhua together, enabling them to gradually understand each other further and develop mutual affection.
    Liu Yuhua's mother died when she was young, and she now has a stepmother with an old feudal mindset. She usually doesn't allow Liu Yuhua to come out to meetings, saying, "What kind of example is it for a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl to be running around everywhere?" Fang Youhao said to Liu Yuhua, "It's more difficult to get through to older people's thinking, so you must patiently persuade her often. Fight against her feudal ideas!" Liu Yuhua felt that Fang Youhao's words were very sensible and helpful to her progress, so she was happy to talk with him more often.
    At the end of the locust eradication campaign, Fang Youhao's shoes were worn out. One foot was in a patched cloth shoe, and the other was in a broken straw sandal. Liu Yuhua knew that Fang Youhao was also a child who had lost his mother at a young age, and she felt concerned when she saw him like this. In the days that followed, she got up early and stayed up late to cut two loads of grass, secretly sold them, bought a foot of cloth, and secretly made a pair of single shoes to give to Fang Youhao. This twenty-one-year-old peasant, who had worked as a hired hand for eight years before liberation, felt very warm in his heart for the first time after receiving a girl's care.
    However, Liu Yuhua's mother was always unpersuaded and always tried to prevent her daughter's legitimate activities. Liu Yuhua criticized her mother's feudal ideas, and her mother said that she was "turning the world upside down," constantly hitting and scolding her. Liu Yuhua's father was an honest man and couldn't control the situation. The family was in turmoil, and production was disrupted. In order not to affect production, Liu Yuhua had to propose to live separately from her parents temporarily.
    A young girl will always encounter some difficulties when she starts living alone. Fang Youhao often came to help. If Fang Youhao needed a needle and thread, Liu Yuhua would also take the initiative to mend and sew for him. As the days passed, their feelings for each other deepened. Later, the two became engaged. During this period, Liu Yuhua's parents had introduced her to other marriage prospects, but she firmly rejected them.
    The Resist America, Aid Korea movement spread to this area in August 1951, shaking the liberated peasants of Heping Village. The slogan "Defeat the American aggressors and defend the fruits of liberation" resounded throughout the village. Liu Yuhua, like others, hated the American aggressors, but she was not a young man and had never held a gun. So she thought of the person she loved. She was very sad and reluctant to see him leave her, but when she thought of their future happy life and the suffering people of China, she finally made up her mind: to mobilize Fang Youhao to join the Volunteer Army.
    In fact, why did Fang Youhao need Liu Yuhua to mobilize him? He thought of the liberation of Guanyun at the end of 1948 and the land reform, which had given him land and ended his life as a painful hired hand. Although his family had an elderly father and a younger brother, and labor and capital were insufficient, as long as he compared it to the past, it was like heaven and earth. Moreover, he had already joined a mutual aid group, and life would get better day by day. He thought of defending this life and decided to pick up a gun and go to Korea. However, another contradiction was intertwined in this young man's heart. When Liu Yuhua mobilized him to join the Volunteer Army, he hesitated for a long time before saying, "I'm afraid I'll miss home!" Liu Yuhua felt a pang of sadness but suppressed her tears. She resolutely said, "If you go to Korea and come back in eight years, I'll wait eight years to marry you; if you come back in ten years, I'll wait ten years to marry you! As for your father and younger brother, I will take care of them completely. If there is not enough labor, I will come over." Fang Youhao looked at this girl who was infinitely loyal to him, so excited that he didn't know how to express his gratitude. Liu Yuhua then invited Fang Youhao to go to the market tomorrow to buy an engagement certificate. That very night, Fang Youhao expressed his determination at the village's mass meeting, requesting to join the Volunteer Army. The next day, as soon as dawn broke, the two of them went to Banpu (market town) to buy an engagement certificate. They registered the engagement at the township government (the Marriage Law does not stipulate that engagements must be registered; but those who wish to register may do so). Along the way, the two talked and laughed, feeling particularly happy.
    On the day the young people who requested to join the Volunteer Army gathered, Liu Yuhua, along with countless enthusiastic well-wishers, escorted Fang Youhao from the village to the township, and from the township to the district. Liu Yuhua personally pinned a red flower on Fang Youhao's chest and said, "I'm really sorry that I don't even have a decent piece of clothing to give you." Fang Youhao smiled and said, "How silly! The Volunteer Army has the support of the people of the whole country, so why worry about clothes? I will study hard there and fiercely beat the American devils!" Liu Yuhua said, "I will definitely work hard in production to support you!"
    After this test of the movement, Fang Youhao and Liu Yuhua were both admitted to the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.
    However, due to long-term overwork and a life of poverty, Fang Youhao's physical condition did not meet the requirements for enlistment. After the comrades' patient persuasion, he had no choice but to return to Heping Village. This made him very sad and afraid to see people. Liu Yuhua then comforted him, saying, "Since your body is not qualified, there is no need to force it. Anyway, there must be people in the front and in the rear. We will participate in the patriotic increase production movement at home, consolidate the mutual aid group, strengthen the militia work, and support the front, which is also resisting America and aiding Korea." League members and cadres also came to comfort him. His emotions quickly stabilized, and he worked even more actively than before.
    The love between this young couple is increasingly consolidated in labor, work, and the basis of mutual promotion of progress. But some old-minded people still can't stand it and always say behind their backs, "Although it's a new world now, things shouldn't be so unmanly and unfeminine!" Her mother said, "I don't believe it: once a daughter grows up, she can't be controlled!" Although her father was also a sufferer, he always wanted his daughter to marry into a better family so that she wouldn't suffer for a lifetime like him, so he didn't quite agree with Liu Yuhua and Fang Youhao getting together. He said, "My daughter should at least marry into a family that is twice as well off as mine; marrying Fang Youhao will only lead to suffering."
    A few days after Liu Yuhua and Fang Youhao got married, her uncle came over, looked at Fang Youhao's small thatched cottage, and sarcastically said, "Is your family good at weaving mats?" (Weaving mats is the main sideline of the masses here). He also said, "You didn't go to the rich families, but insisted on鑽ing into poor holes!" Liu Yuhua retorted angrily, "I'm marrying a person, not money! You are also a poor person, so why do you look down on poor people like that!" Fang Youhao's father, who had suffered a lifetime in the old society, was so excited that he was at a loss when he saw his son bringing in a new daughter-in-law without spending a penny. He said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party and the Marriage Law, I would have worn out my lips trying to find a wife for my son."
    During the busy farming season, the young couple actively participated in mutual aid group production; during the slack season, the man went up the mountain to cut grass, and the woman wove mats at home. Their lives have already improved compared to before their marriage, and they continue to improve. Whenever the government has any calls, the man goes to lead the village militia organization, and the woman goes to promote the village women's organization, competing with each other in enthusiasm. Everyone in the village praises them. Now, they have been married for a whole year. Liu Yuhua's parents can't really say anything "bad" about this young couple. In addition, Liu Yuhua and Fang Youhao often go over there to talk about the principles of the Marriage Law, and the two old people are beginning to suspect that their own thinking is indeed a bit wrong.

    刘玉花和房友好
    莫测
    江苏省灌云县南城区临海乡群众在一九五一年春天响应政府号召，掀起了灭蝗运动。和平村贫农的女儿刘玉花，一个又结实又俊巧的姑娘，在灭蝗运动中非常积极，人家选她当了小组长。别的小组每天打十来斤蝗虫，她的小组总是打十七八斤到二十斤。因为她们小组成绩突出，和平村民兵分队长兼灭蝗队分队长房友好便抓紧对她们的领导，作为推动全分队的力量。工作把房友好和刘玉花经常拉到一起，使他们进一步逐渐互相了解，并产生了互相爱慕之情。
    刘玉花从小死了母亲，现在有个晚娘，是个老封建脑筋，平时总不让刘玉花出来开会，她说：“十七八岁的大姑娘，东钻西钻的成什么样？”房友好对刘玉花说：“年纪大的人，思想比较难通，要经常耐心的说服她。和她的封建思想作斗争！”刘玉花觉得房友好的话句句中听，对自己的进步很有帮助，也就很乐意和他在一起多谈谈。
    灭蝗运动结束时，房友好的鞋子穿坏了，一只脚套着破布鞋，一只脚穿着破草鞋。刘玉花知道房友好也是一个从小离娘的孩子，看他这样，放不下心。便在以后的日子里，赶早带晚砍了两背草，暗暗卖了，买尺把布，偷空做起一双单鞋，送给房友好。这个在解放前做了八年长工的二十一岁的青年农民，第一次受到姑娘的关怀，心里感到非常温暖。
    但是，刘玉花的娘总是说不服，总是要阻挡女儿的正当活动。刘玉花对母亲的封建思想，提出批评，母亲就说她“翻了天”，整天要打要骂的。刘玉花的父亲是个老实人，管不了。家里闹得不能安神，生产也停顿了。为了不影响生产，刘玉花不得不提出和父母暂时分开过。
    一位年轻的姑娘开始单独生活，总会碰到一些困难。房友好便经常过来帮忙。房友好有点针头线脑的，刘玉花也就主动的过来补补连连。日子越长，他们之间的情意也就越深。以后两人就订了婚。其间刘玉花的父母曾经给女儿说过亲事，也被女儿坚决拒绝了。
    抗美援朝运动在一九五一年八月开展到这一带，震动了和平村的翻身农民，“打退美国侵略者，保卫翻身果实”的口号响遍全村。刘玉花和其他人一样仇恨美国侵略者，可是她不是一个小伙子，也没有拿过枪，于是她想到了自己心爱的人。她很难过，舍不得他离开自己，可是想到她俩将来的美满生活，想到全中国的受苦人，她终于打定了主意：动员房友好参加志愿军。
    其实，房友好何必要刘玉花来动员呵！他想到一九四八年底灌云解放，想到土地改革，使自己有了土地，结束了痛苦的长工生活，虽然家里上有老父亲，下有小弟弟，劳动力和农本都不足，可是只要和过去一比，还是一个天、一个地。况且他已经参加了互助组，日子会一天一天好起来的。他想到要保卫这个日子，就想到要拿起枪到朝鲜去。但是，在这个年青人心里，却交织着另一种矛盾。刘玉花动员他参加志愿军时，他别了半天才说：“我怕想家！”刘玉花一阵心酸，但抑制着没有哭出来。她果决地说：“你到朝鲜，八年回来，我等八年和你结婚；十年回来，我等十年和你结婚！至于你爹和小弟弟，完全由我照顾。劳动力不够，我就过来。”房友好看着这个对他无限忠诚的姑娘，激动得不知怎样才能倒出他一肚子的感谢。刘玉花接着就邀房友好明天到集上买订婚证。就这天晚上，房友好在村的群众大会上表示了决心，要求参加志愿军。第二天，东方刚发白，他们俩就往板铺（集镇）去买了订婚证。到乡政府进行了订婚登记（婚姻法并没有规定订婚要登记；但愿意登记也可以）。一路上，两人有说有笑，特别快活。
    请求参加志愿军的青年集中的一天，刘玉花和无数热情欢送的群众一起，把房友好由村送到乡、又由乡送到区。刘玉花亲自把红花插上房友好的胸前说：“真对不起你，连一件像样的衣服都没有送给你。”房友好笑着说：“真傻！志愿军有全国人民支援，还愁衣服穿？我到那里，一定要好好学习，狠狠打美国鬼子！”刘玉花说：“我一定好好生产，支援你们！”
    经过这个运动的考验，房友好和刘玉花都被吸收加入中国新民主主义青年团。
    可是，由于过去长期的过度劳动和不得温饱的生活，房友好的体格不合入伍条件。经过同志们耐心的劝说，他又不得已地回了和平村。这使他非常难过，怕见人。刘玉花便安慰他说：“既然身体不合格，也不必勉强。反正前方后方都要有人，我们在家参加爱国增产运动，巩固互助组，加强民兵工作，支援前线，也是抗美援朝。”团员和干部们也都来安慰他。他的情绪很快稳定下来，工作比以前更积极了。
    这对年轻男女的爱情，在劳动中、工作中，和互相推动进步的基础上，日益巩固起来。但是有些老脑筋的人还是看不惯，背后总是说：“现在虽然是新世道，可是也不能那样不男不女的！”她娘说：“我才不相信呢：闺女大了，就管不了！”她父亲虽然也是个受苦人，可是心里总想叫女儿到个比较好一些的人家，不要和自己一样，受一辈子苦，所以他也不大同意刘玉花和房友好结合，他说：“我的闺女至少该嫁给一个比我生活好一倍的人家；嫁给房友好只有受罪。”
    刘玉花和房友好结婚后几天，她叔父走来，看看房友好的小茅草屋子就讥讽说：“你家好织席子吗？”（织席子是这里群众的主要副业）。又说：“有钱人家你不去，偏要往穷洞里钻！”刘玉花气愤地反驳说：“我嫁的是人，不是嫁的钱！你也是穷人，为什么那样看不起穷人呢！”房友好的父亲，在旧社会里受了一辈子苦，他看到儿子没花一个钱就娶来个新媳妇，兴奋得手足无措。他说：“要是没有共产党、婚姻法，我把嘴皮子磨破也没法给儿子说个媳妇。”
    农忙时，小俩口子都积极参加互助组生产；农闲时，男的上山砍草，女的在家织席子。他们的生活已经比婚前提高了，而且在继续提高。政府有什么号召，男的去领导村里民兵组织，女的去推动村里的妇女组织，论积极，一个赛一个。村里人个个夸赞。现在，他们结婚已经整一年了。刘玉花的父母看着这小俩口子，实在说不出个“坏”字。加上刘玉花和房友好也常到那边谈谈婚姻法的道理，两位老人也开始怀疑自己的思想的确有些不对了。
