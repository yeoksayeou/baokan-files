Telegram of Condolence from the Xinjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions to the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions:

    The Xinjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions of China, on behalf of 140,000 workers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, expresses its deepest grief at the passing of our most beloved leader of the working people of the world, Comrade Stalin.
    Comrade Stalin led the Soviet people to victoriously build a socialist society and victoriously advance towards a communist society. Comrade Stalin illuminated the road to victory for the cause of liberation of all mankind.
    Dear Soviet worker comrades: In these sorrowful days of the passing of the great revolutionary leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, all ethnic groups of workers in Xinjiang extend our condolences to you. We will forever remember Comrade Stalin's teachings that the working class must unite firmly with the spirit of internationalism. We will certainly unite closely with the Soviet people forever and fight to the end to defend world peace.
    In order to mourn the passing of the great teacher Comrade Stalin, the Xinjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions has called on workers of all ethnic groups to diligently learn from the advanced production experience of Soviet workers, accelerate the construction of our motherland, and advance victoriously under the glorious banner of Lenin and Stalin.
                                The Xinjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions of China
                              March 8, 1953
