Telegram of Condolence from the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia:

    We were deeply saddened to learn of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Gottwald, the great leader of the Czechoslovak people and the Communist Party, and an outstanding activist in the world workers' movement, and we express our deepest condolences. Our working class and all the people of Anshan, like all the people of China, will, under the leadership of the great Comrade Mao Zedong, more resolutely and diligently engage in our national defense and economic construction, and steadily realize the industrialization of our country. Our great Chinese people will, together with the great Czechoslovak people, in the name of the glorious Stalin, and under the great banner of internationalism, unite and cooperate more closely, further strengthen the friendship between China and Czechoslovakia, and continuously strengthen the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, in order to defend world peace and advance our common cause of socialism and communism!
                        The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
