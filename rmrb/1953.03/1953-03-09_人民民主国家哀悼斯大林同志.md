Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 7th: The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in a letter to all members of the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people issued on the 6th, expressed their deepest condolences on the death of Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the world's working people and the liberator and mentor of the Korean people. They called on all members of the Korean Workers' Party and all the Korean people to further heighten their vigilance against the enemy, fight more resolutely, smash any arrogant attempts by the enemy, and strive for final victory.

The Central Committee of the Labor Party and the Cabinet of the Republic said: Stalin's name is infinitely precious to our party and the Korean people, just like to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people.

Comrade Stalin, together with Lenin, created, nurtured, and strengthened the powerful Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Stalin, together with Lenin, organized and led the great October Socialist Revolution, created the world's first socialist country, and led the Soviet people to world-historic victories.

The banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin illuminated the path of national liberation for the Korean people and inspired and propelled them to victory.

Marshal Stalin was the organizer and inspirer of the Soviet army and the Soviet people in their victory over German fascism and Japanese militarism in World War II. The steel warriors sent by the great Stalin, with their righteous guns and swords, drove out the Japanese imperialists from our territory and liberated our Korean people.

Comrade Stalin armed our Labor Party and our Korean people with the doctrine of sure victory.

The death of Comrade Stalin, who dedicated his life unreservedly to the great cause of striving for the happiness of mankind, is an immeasurable loss not only to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, but also to our party and our people, and the greatest loss to all mankind.

The news of Comrade Stalin's death has aroused deep mourning among all workers, peasants, working intellectuals, heroic soldiers of the Korean People's Army, and male and female guerrillas in our country. All the Korean people, immersed in deep grief, express even greater love and respect for the benefactor who liberated them, for the great Marshal Stalin, who has always sincerely helped our people in our solemn struggle for the unification and independence of our motherland, and gave our struggle a bright future and outlook. At the same time, they solemnly swear that in order to achieve the freedom, happiness, and independence of our people that he desired as soon as possible, they will unite more firmly around Marshal Kim Il-sung, one of Stalin's outstanding students, and the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic under his leadership, and devote themselves more vigorously to the fight against the enemy called by the Party and the leader.

The guarantee of final victory over the aggressors lies in loyalty to the doctrines of Lenin and Stalin and internationalism, and in further consolidating the leadership of our people, the Korean Workers' Party, organizationally and ideologically. It is necessary to further strengthen the friendship and unity between our country and the people of the people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union, to further strengthen the ideological and organizational unity of our party, to further increase the revolutionary vigilance and ardent hatred of all party members and all people towards the enemy, and to further strengthen our People's Army and our rear. All party members and all the people must be firmly united around the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and our beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-sung, mobilize and give full play to all their strength, wisdom and talent, make all preparations, smash any arrogant attempts by the enemy, and strive for final victory.

The image of Stalin, the great revolutionary standard-bearer, is a symbol of the victory of the entire Korean people and the entire soldiers of the Korean People's Army who are rising up to wage a sacred war.

Long live the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, which is invincible in all battles!

Appeal from the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the Council of Ministers, and the Presidium of the Republic

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 8th: Budapest News: The Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, and the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic issued an appeal to the Hungarian people to mourn the death of Comrade Stalin. The appeal stated: The death of Comrade Stalin is the greatest loss for the workers of the world and the hundreds of millions of people fighting for peace and freedom since the death of the great Lenin. Millions of Hungarian workers, peasants, and intellectuals are mourning Comrade Stalin, because of the liberation cause of the Soviet army he educated and led, our country gained independence, and the Hungarian people gained freedom, which the best children of our people had struggled for and failed to achieve. With the friendly support of Comrade Stalin, the Hungarian people were able to defend our peaceful independence and began and are continuing the socialist construction of our country. Comrade Stalin's teachings, instructions, and examples have educated, nurtured, and tempered the Hungarian Working People's Party—the organizer of the struggle and victory of the working people of our country. Comrade Stalin's name, work, and teachings are forever inseparable from the lives of our people.

The great teacher and leader has passed away, but his students, comrades, and soldiers are still here, and they will surely defend and continue his cause. Comrade Stalin's army and camp are infinitely powerful and invincible, and we Hungarians also belong to this camp. Let us unite more closely around our great party, the government of our People's Republic, and Comrade Mátyás Rákosi, Comrade Stalin's faithful student. Following Stalin's teachings, let us further strengthen our party, so that it is more closely united with all the working people; let us make our People's Republic, our People's Army—the defenders of our country's independence and peace—stronger; let us work more selflessly and with discipline to implement our five-year plan and improve the material and cultural standards of our people; let us increase our vigilance against enemies at home and abroad and strengthen our struggle to defend peace.

The Hungarian people's loyalty to the Soviet people, the peace camp led by the Soviet Union, the cause of friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, and proletarian internationalism is stronger than ever before. Under the invincible banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, under the guidance of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, and in strong solidarity with the fraternal people's democracies and the workers of the world, let us fight and work for the victory of building socialism in our country, and fight and work for the victory of the cause of peace in the world.
