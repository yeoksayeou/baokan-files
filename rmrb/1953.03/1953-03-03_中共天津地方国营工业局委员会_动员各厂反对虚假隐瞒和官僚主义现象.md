The CCP Tianjin Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau Committee held a conference of responsible cadres from the Party committees, administrative departments, trade unions, and Communist Youth League branches of its affiliated factories on February 23rd. The conference mobilized the factories to strengthen criticism and self-criticism and launch a struggle against falsehood, concealment, complacency, and bureaucracy. The aim is to further strengthen the Party's leadership, enhance ideological work, and create favorable conditions for formulating quotas and plans.

Comrade Li Zhongyuan of the CCP Tianjin Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau Committee delivered a mobilization report at the meeting. He pointed out that there are very serious unhealthy phenomena in the work of the Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau. These are: (1) Some units conceal the true situation in their enterprises, exaggerate achievements, minimize shortcomings, report only the good news and not the bad, and even engage in deception. He said, "This is the most dangerous and egregious behavior that violates Party discipline and state law. With this situation existing, it is impossible to formulate advanced plans and average advanced quotas." (2) A considerable number of leading cadres in the units are complacent and lack criticism and self-criticism. In this discussion and revision of the plan, some factory leaders attributed shortcomings in their work to poor leadership and the backwardness of the masses and were unwilling to conduct self-criticism. Some comrades profess infinite loyalty to the Party and the people, but when their shortcomings are exposed, they try to cover them up in various ways; or they become extremely sentimental, complaining that the leadership is "not comprehensive" and "has forgotten their work achievements," and even request to be transferred. They do not accept the criticism of the masses with a humble attitude and improve their work, but rather seize on a small factual inaccuracy to deny the whole picture; the worst even harbor resentment against the critics and retaliate against them. Comrade Li Zhongyuan pointed out that such behavior of fearing criticism and resisting criticism cannot be tolerated. It will cause the leadership to lose the supervision of the masses and put our entire work in a dangerous situation.

Comrade Li Zhongyuan pointed out that the weak ideological work of the Bureau's leading cadres, the lack of criticism and self-criticism, the lack of in-depth understanding of the situation and inspection of work, and blind complacency are the main reasons why the above-mentioned undesirable tendencies have persisted for a long time. He analyzed that the specific reasons for the occurrence of falsehood, concealment, and reporting only good news and not bad news in the work are threefold: (1) naiveté and ignorance, insufficient understanding of the harm of false phenomena; (2) bureaucracy, lack of understanding of the situation; (3) the prevalence of individualism, conscious deception.

He announced that from now on, all factories should fully promote democracy, rely on the masses, and realistically examine all dishonest behaviors such as falsehood, concealment, and reporting only good news and not bad news, and find ways to improve them, in order to do a good job in production plans and production quotas and meet the large-scale economic construction of the country.

    中共天津地方国营工业局委员会
    动员各厂反对虚假隐瞒和官僚主义现象
    中共天津市地方国营工业局委员会，在二月二十三日召开该局所属各厂党委、行政、工会、青年团负责干部大会，动员各厂加强批评与自我批评，展开反虚假隐瞒、反骄傲自满、反官僚主义斗争，以进一步加强党的领导，加强思想工作，为制订定额和计划创造有利条件。
    中共天津市地方国营工业局委员会李中垣同志在会上做了动员报告。他指出地方国营工业局在工作中存在非常严重的病态现象，这就是：（一）有些单位隐瞒企业中的真实情况，夸大成绩，缩小缺点，报喜不报忧，甚至弄虚作假。他说：“这是一种最危险最恶劣的违反党纪和国法的行为；有了这种情况存在，就不可能制订出先进的计划和平均先进定额。”（二）相当多的单位领导干部骄傲自满，缺乏批评与自我批评。在这次讨论修订计划中，有些工厂的领导干部对于工作中的缺点，认为是领导不好和群众落后，不肯进行自我批评。有些同志口头上对党、对人民无限忠诚，而当他的缺点被揭发后，就多方掩饰；或者伤感备至，抱怨领导“不全面”、“忘记了他的工作成绩”，甚至要求调动工作。对群众的批评不是以虚心的态度接受，并改进工作，而是抓住事实上有一点小的出入就否认全盘；最恶劣的甚至对批评者怀恨在心，打击报复。李中垣同志指出：对于这种害怕批评、抗拒批评的行为，是不能容忍的，它会使领导失去群众的监督，使我们整个工作陷入危险境地。
    李中垣同志指出：局的领导干部思想工作薄弱，缺乏批评与自我批评，缺乏深入了解情况和检查工作，盲目自满，是上述不良倾向得以长期存在的主要原因。他分析在工作中发生虚假、隐瞒、报喜不报忧现象的具体原因有三：（一）是幼稚无知，对虚假现象的危害性认识不足；（二）是官僚主义，不了解情况；（三）是个人主义作祟，有意识地弄虚作假。
    他宣布自即日起各工厂都应该充分发扬民主，依靠群众，实事求是地检查一切虚假、隐瞒、报喜不报忧等等不忠诚老实的行为，并找出改进办法，以便做好生产计划和生产定额，迎接国家大规模经济建设。
