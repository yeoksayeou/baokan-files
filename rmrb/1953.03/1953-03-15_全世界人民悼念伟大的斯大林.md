        Mongolian People's Republic
    Mongolian herdsmen, workers, and staff members across the country have been sending telegrams to the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, expressing their deep sorrow over the death of Stalin and vowing to fulfill his legacy. On March 6, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Popov met with delegations of workers from the Stalin Meat Combine and the Choibalsan United Industrial Factory. The heads of the delegations, on behalf of all the personnel of their factories, expressed their deep condolences on the death of Comrade Stalin and requested that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Council of Ministers be informed that the Mongolian people would do everything possible to further consolidate the friendship between the Mongolian people and the Soviet people, inspired by our dear Stalin.

        German Democratic Republic
    In memory of Stalin, workers in state-owned factories in the German Democratic Republic launched a labor emulation campaign to complete their production plans ahead of schedule by December 21, Stalin's birthday. Throughout the country, hundreds of thousands of workers, farmers, intellectuals, and technicians announced that they would carry out voluntary labor, promote the rationalization proposal movement, improve product quality, reduce costs, and reduce defective products.
    The workers of the newly built No. 4 furnace of the Eastern Steel Plant on the Oder-Neisse River on the German-Polish border created a new production record for the furnace, producing 36 percent more pig iron than planned, fulfilling the guarantee they made on the day of Stalin's death.
    Many advanced and outstanding working people in Germany applied to join the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in order to inherit Stalin's cause more actively. All members of the Plänitz Agricultural Production Cooperative announced that they would join the German-Soviet Friendship Association in memory of Stalin.
        India
    People from all walks of life in India mourned the death of Stalin, the great leader and teacher of progressive humanity, with deep sorrow.
    At 2:30 PM Indian time on March 9, just as the funeral was being held in Moscow's Red Square, 35,000 workers in 41 factories in the Bombay industrial area simultaneously laid down their tools and stood beside their machines in silent tribute. Transportation workers throughout Calcutta automatically stopped trains, trams, and buses for five minutes in silent tribute. Indian workers in other regions also mourned the death of Stalin in various ways.
    Mass memorial services were held in the four major cities of Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras.
    At the memorial service held at the University of Calcutta, many professors and students emphasized in their speeches the need to learn from Stalin's boundless loyalty and tireless work to safeguard world peace. Memorial services were also held in other schools in various cities in India.
    General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, Ghosh, said in his condolence telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on behalf of the Communist Party of India: Stalin was the correct teacher and friend for the people of colonial and enslaved countries in their struggle for freedom and democracy. Vice Chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress, Mirajkar, issued a statement saying: The Indian working class must continue to struggle for peace, independence, and democracy on the path indicated by Stalin.
    Newspapers throughout India published special issues in memory of Stalin, publishing commentaries and many articles and pictures introducing Stalin's great achievements in various periods of his life.
        Pakistan
    A memorial meeting of representatives from all walks of life in Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, was held to mourn the death of Stalin, the teacher of the world's working people. The hall where the memorial meeting was held was packed. Those present stood in silence for Stalin.
    Secretary-General of the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, Shamsul Haque, told those present: "Stalin has always been dedicated to serving the happiness of mankind, so the vast majority of people in the world regard Stalin as their leader and leader."
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Pakistan expressed its condolences on the death of the great Stalin in a resolution passed in Lahore on March 8. The resolution said: "The existence of Comrade Stalin is a great inspiration and source of strength for the working masses of the world."
        Nepal
    The news of Stalin's death caused great grief to the Nepalese people. Various political parties in Nepal jointly held a mass meeting in Birgunj to mourn the death of the great Stalin. Many shops in the city closed to express their condolences.
        Laos
    Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Free National United Front and Chairman of the Lao Resistance Government, sent a telegram to the Soviet government and people on March 9 to mourn the death of Comrade Stalin. The telegram said:
    The Lao people have just received the news of the unfortunate passing of Marshal Stalin, the father, leader, and teacher of all mankind. We feel immense grief, just like the Soviet people and the people of the world. At the same time, we pledge to unite more closely around the Soviet government and people and wage a resolute struggle against the imperialist aggressors to defend world peace.
        United States
    "Pravda" published an article by its New York correspondent, Kraminov, describing how ordinary people in the United States mourned J.V. Stalin.
    Kraminov wrote that for three days, people had been pouring into the headquarters of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations like a continuous tide.
    To mourn Stalin, they needed to overcome many obstacles. They did not let their bosses or superiors know their thoughts, they detoured to the Soviet delegation headquarters, trying to quietly slip past the police and detectives stationed on nearby corners, avoiding their attention. In front of this building, they had to cover their faces to avoid the group of abominable photographers, who worked more for the Federal Bureau of Investigation than for newspapers, trying to photograph everyone who went in and out. In the present United States, a photograph of an American at the door of a Soviet agency is a serious and indefensible piece of evidence, enough to ruin the lives of an entire family.
    Nevertheless, American workers, students, farmers, and intellectuals irresistibly came to this simple room to express their gratitude and love for this teacher and friend of the working people of the world.
    Not only New Yorkers came here to mourn Stalin, but also office workers from Connecticut, workers from Illinois, housewives from New Jersey, miners from Pennsylvania, teachers from California, and students from Chicago. Not only Americans came to mourn Stalin, but also Ecuadorians, Colombians, Argentines, Chileans, Cubans, and Mexicans. Under the signatures of students from Columbia University in New York, there were signatures of people from Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Ceylon, and the Philippines.
    A group of Columbia University students came in. They formed a tight semicircle in front of Stalin's portrait, looking very much like those keeping vigil. Then they went to the table, and one of them wrote clearly on a whole page of the signature book: "Long live the friendship between the American people and the Soviet people!"
    A representative of the United Electrical Workers Union, some students from Hunter College, and some soldiers from the American army also expressed the American people's desire for peace and friendship with the Soviet people.
        France
    The people of Paris held a memorial meeting at the Winter Velodrome on the evening of the 9th, with more than 50,000 people participating. Auguste Lecœur, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and Marcel Cachin and Étienne Fajon, members of the Political Bureau, spoke at the meeting. Fajon said: "Taking Stalin's party as an example, his writings as a guide, and following the valuable advice given in his last speech, we French Communists and workers will know how to carry out a victorious struggle for peace and democratic independence, for democracy and socialism."
    Lecœur said: "The French people have learned from experience that whoever opposes the Soviet Union opposes the French nation. Because there is a party in the world that is loyal to Lenin and Stalin, and because this party is closely connected with the masses, the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism is bound to come. We, the French Communists, under the leadership of Thorez and Duclos, using Stalin's immortal works as our weapons, and learning from Stalin's example better every day, will surely make France a free, strong, and happy country."
    In memory of Comrade Stalin, the French Communist Party launched a movement to recruit new members. Many advanced working people applied to join the party. Many others joined the France-USSR Association to fight for the consolidation of friendship between the French and Soviet people.
        United Kingdom
    Delegations from local organizations of the Communist Party of Great Britain and hundreds of thousands of working people have been going to the Soviet Embassy in London for days to lay flowers before the portrait of Comrade Stalin. Memorial services were held throughout Britain. Pam Dutt, Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of Great Britain, delivered a eulogy at the memorial service in London, pointing out the calm strength and unity shown by the Soviet people. George Matthews, Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party, said at the memorial service in Aberdare: The people of Wales, who have been deprived of all their national rights, have always regarded Stalin as a fighter for the national independence of all countries. The Communists of Wales have decided to greatly strengthen the ranks of the party as a gift to Comrade Stalin.
    Organizations of the Communist Party of Great Britain, trade union leaders, representatives of progressive organizations, and people from all walks of life have been writing letters or telegrams to the Soviet Embassy in London, expressing their determination to strengthen the struggle.
        Italy
    The Soviet Embassy in Rome has been receiving thousands of telegrams and letters from the Italian people mourning the death of Comrade Stalin for days. Two thousand agricultural workers from Baricella, Bologna Province, wrote: We pledge to follow the instructions of Comrade Stalin in the struggle for the liberation of peasants. Agricultural workers from Molinella said: "In memory of Stalin, the peace movement will surely grow stronger."
        Austria
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Austria held a memorial service in Vienna on the 8th. Memorial services have also been held in many industrial centers and major cities in Lower Austria for days. Many factories and enterprises sent delegations to the headquarters of the Soviet forces in the Stadlau district of Vienna to offer condolences. On the 9th, at the moment when the people of Moscow bid farewell to Comrade Stalin for the last time, factory sirens sounded in Vienna and other industrial centers, and all vehicles stopped to mourn the death of Comrade Stalin.
    In memory of Comrade Stalin, workers at the Steyr factory in Austria wrote on the factory gate: "We are not alone—Stalin's teachings continue to be with us." The following was also written on the walls of a Vienna factory:
    "Our friendship with the Soviet people is unbreakable."
        Sweden
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Sweden wrote in its announcement to the people: "Let the Communist Party of Sweden become a model for following the teachings of Josef Stalin, the greatest Marxist of our time; let the Communist Party of Sweden better grasp Stalin's genius theories, strengthen the party's organization, develop new party members, promote the party newspaper among the broad strata of the Swedish people, raise the banner of struggle for international freedom, democracy and peace, and achieve final victory, to commemorate Stalin!" On March 9, working people in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, Gothenburg, the second largest city in Sweden, and in Örebro and Karlskoga held rallies to mourn Comrade Stalin.
            Norway
    The Communist Party of Norway issued a statement saying: "In these days of mourning the death of our beloved leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, we will unite more closely and more firmly in the great movement that holds high the banner of peace, democracy and socialism throughout the world. The world communist movement, headed by the united and long-tested Communist Party of the Soviet Union, will continue the cause to which Stalin devoted his life until final victory." Memorial meetings were held in Oslo, the capital of Norway, and other cities such as Larvik, at which the leaders of the Communist Party of Norway reported on Stalin's life and achievements. Just Lippe, Secretary of the Communist Party of Norway, told the people who filled the People's Hall in Oslo: "Stalin's name will live forever. His name and his life's work are immortal. Let us remember his name and work harder to complete his cause. His life is the banner of this cause: the banner of peace, progress and socialism."
        Denmark
    In Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, several thousand citizens participated in a memorial rally held in the square on the evening of the 7th. Before the memorial meeting, there was a torchlight procession organized by the progressive youth of Denmark. Lars Larsen, Chairman of the Communist Party of Denmark, delivered a eulogy at the meeting. The meeting unanimously passed a condolence telegram to the Soviet government and people, which said: "At this difficult moment, we assure you that our friendship and solidarity in the common struggle of the people of all countries for peace, freedom and socialism is unbreakable. Stalin's glory is immortal! Long live the Soviet Union! Long live the friendship between the Danish and Soviet people!"
        Morocco
    Ali Yata, Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Morocco, who is currently imprisoned in the Fresnes prison in Paris, issued a statement, deeply mourning the death of Comrade Stalin. He said: "The Communist Party of Morocco must constantly draw strength from the treasure trove that Stalin left to mankind, lead the Moroccan nation, and carry out the struggle more enthusiastically and more successfully in order to regain the democratic rights that the French colonialists refuse to give them, restore Morocco's independence, so that others cannot use Morocco as a base of aggression against the Soviet Union."

        美　国
    “真理报”发表驻纽约记者克拉米诺夫的一篇文章，描述美国的普通人民怎样悼念约·维·斯大林。
    克拉米诺夫写道，三天来，人们像一股继续不断的潮水一样涌进苏联驻联合国代表团总部。
    为了悼念斯大林，他们需要克服很多障碍。他们不让他们的老板或上司知道他们的心思，他们绕道到苏联代表团总部来，设法悄悄地溜过布满在附近角落的警察与侦探，避免他们的注意。在这个楼房的前面，他们必须掩着面孔避开那群可恶的摄影记者，这群摄影记者与其说是替报馆工作倒不如说是为联邦调查局工作，他们设法拍下每一个进出的人的照片。在现在的美国，一个美国人在苏联机关门口的照片就是一种严重的与无法辩解的罪证，足以破坏整整一家人的生活。
    虽然如此，美国的工人、学生、农民、知识分子不可抵挡地来到这个简朴的房间里，表示他们对这位全世界劳动人民的导师、朋友的感激和热爱。
    来这里悼念斯大林的不但有纽约人，还有来自康涅狄格州的职员，来自伊利诺斯州的工人，来自新泽西州的家庭妇女，来自宾夕法尼亚州的矿工，来自加利福尼亚州的教师，来自芝加哥的学生。来悼念斯大林的不但有美国人，还有厄瓜多尔人，哥伦比亚人，阿根廷人，智利人，古巴人和墨西哥人。在纽约哥伦比亚大学学生的签名下面，有突尼斯人、沙特阿拉伯人、锡兰人和菲律宾人的签名。
    有一群哥伦比亚大学的学生进来了。他们在斯大林像面前形成一个紧密的半圆形肃立，很像守灵人。接着他们走到桌子那里去，其中的一个人在签名簿的一整页上很清楚地写着：“美国人民与苏联人民友好万岁！”
    美国电气工人工会的一位代表、汉特尔大学的一些学生和美国军队的某些士兵也表示了美国人民要求与苏联人民和平、友好的愿望。
        法　国
    巴黎人民九日晚在冬季赛车场举行追悼大会，有五万多人参加。法国共产党中央委员会书记奥古斯特·勒戈尔、政治局委员马赛尔·加香、艾蒂安·法戎在会上作了演说。法戎说：“我们以斯大林的党作为榜样，以他的著作作为指针，并遵循他最后一次演说所给予的宝贵忠告，我们法国共产党人和男、女工人们将知道如何为争取和平与民主独立、为争取民主与社会主义而进行胜利的斗争。”
    勒戈尔说：“法国人民从经验中了解到：凡是反对苏联的，也就是反对法兰西民族。由于世界上有忠实于列宁和斯大林的党，由于这个党密切联系着群众，所以和平、民主和社会主义的胜利必然要到来。我们法国共产党人在多列士和杜克洛的领导下，以斯大林不朽的著作为武器，并每天更好地学习着斯大林的榜样，我们一定使法国成为一个自由、强大和幸福的国家。”
    为了纪念斯大林同志，法国共产党发动了吸收新党员的运动。许多先进的劳动人民申请入党。还有很多人加入了法苏协会，为巩固法、苏两国人民的友谊而斗争。
        英　国
    英国共产党各地方组织的代表团和成千上万的劳动人民连日到伦敦苏联大使馆，向斯大林同志的遗像献花。英国各地都举行了追悼会。英国共产党副主席帕姆·杜德在伦敦的追悼会上致悼词，指出苏联人民所表现的镇定的力量和团结一致。共产党副总书记乔治·马修斯在亚伯达尔地方的追悼会上说：被剥夺了全部民族权利的威尔士人民一直把斯大林看作各国人民争取民族独立的战士。威尔士的共产党人决定要大大壮大党的队伍，作为对斯大林同志的献礼。
    英国共产党各组织、工会领袖、各进步组织的代表和各界人士纷纷写信或打电报给伦敦苏联大使馆，表示要加强进行斗争的决心。
        意大利
    罗马苏联大使馆连日接到意大利人民哀悼斯大林同志逝世的成千封电报和信件。波伦亚省巴里塞拉地方两千个农业工人写道：我们保证要在争取农民解放的斗争中遵照斯大林同志的指示。莫里尼拉地方的农业工人说：“为了纪念斯大林，和平运动一定会更加壮大。”
        奥地利
    奥地利共产党中央委员会于八日在维也纳举行了追悼会。下奥地利许多工业中心和大城市连日也举行了追悼会。许多工厂和企业的工人都派代表团到维也纳斯塔德劳区苏军司令部吊唁。九日，在莫斯科人民向斯大林同志最后告别的时刻，维也纳及其他工业中心各工厂汽笛齐鸣，一切车辆停止行驶，为斯大林同志的逝世志哀。
    为了悼念斯大林同志，奥地利斯泰尔工厂的工人在工厂大门上写道：“我们并不孤独——斯大林的教诲继续和我们同在。”维也纳工厂的墙上也写着：
    “我们和苏联人民的友谊是牢不可破的。”
        瑞　典
    瑞典共产党中央委员会在告人民书中写道：“让瑞典共产党成为遵循我们当代最伟大的马克思主义者约瑟夫·斯大林的遗训的模范；让瑞典共产党更好地掌握斯大林的天才学说、加强党的组织、发展新党员、在瑞典人民的广大阶层内推广党报、举起争取国际自由、民主与和平的旗帜，并取得最后的胜利，这样来纪念斯大林！”三月九日，在瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩、瑞典第二大城市哥德堡以及奥勒德朗和卡尔斯科加等地的劳动人民都举行了追悼斯大林同志的大会。
            挪　威
    挪威的共产党发表声明说：“在我们哀悼我们亲爱的领袖和导师斯大林同志逝世的日子里，我们将更加紧密地和更加坚决地团结在全世界高举着和平、民主和社会主义大旗的伟大运动里。以团结的、久经考验的苏联共产党为首的世界共产主义运动，将把斯大林所毕生致力的事业继续下去，直到最后的胜利。”在挪威首都奥斯陆以及拉维克等其他城市，都举行了追悼大会，会上，由挪威共产党的领袖们作了斯大林生平业迹的报告。挪威共产党书记尤斯特·李皮在奥斯陆人民大厦向挤满了大厦的参加追悼会的人说：“斯大林的名字将永远活在世上。他的名字和他一生的工作是永垂不朽的。让我们记住他的名字，用更大的努力来完成他的事业。他的一生就是这个事业的旗帜：和平、进步与社会主义的旗帜。”
        丹　麦
    在丹麦首都哥本哈根，七日晚上有好几千市民参加了在广场上举行的追悼大会。在追悼会之前有丹麦进步青年所组织的火炬游行。丹麦共产党主席拉荪在会上致悼词。大会一致通过了致苏联政府与人民的唁电，其中说：“在这个困难的时刻，我们向你们保证，我们在各国人民争取和平、自由与社会主义的共同斗争中的友谊与团结是牢不可破的。斯大林的光荣永垂不朽！苏联万岁！丹苏两国人民的友谊万岁！”
        摩洛哥
    现在被囚禁在巴黎费雷纳监狱的摩洛哥共产党总书记阿里·雅塔发表声明，沉痛哀悼斯大林同志逝世。他说：“摩洛哥共产党一定要经常从斯大林留给人类的宝库里汲取力量，领导摩洛哥民族，更加热情、更加成功地进行斗争，以便夺回法国殖民者拒绝给他们的民主权利，恢复摩洛哥的独立，使得别人不能利用摩洛哥来作侵略基地去反对苏联。”
