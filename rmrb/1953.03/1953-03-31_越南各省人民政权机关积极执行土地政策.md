    Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, March 27th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, people's political organs in many provinces of Vietnam have recently been actively implementing the land policy of the Vietnamese government, distributing land belonging to French colonialists and Vietnamese traitors to poor peasants.

    In Nam Định province, approximately 7,000 acres of land belonging to Vietnamese traitors or absentee landlords have been distributed to, or temporarily assigned to, poor peasants, families of military personnel, families of disabled military personnel, and families of martyrs for cultivation. In Hà Nam province, 334 acres of land belonging to French colonialists have been distributed to poor peasants. In An Lão village, after all enemy and puppet organizations and administrative organs were crushed, the local people's political power and people's organizations immediately implemented the government's land policy. They distributed all public land to poor peasants and temporarily assigned 64 acres of land belonging to absentee landlords to farmers for cultivation. This has enabled further development of various resistance efforts in the village. Many young people have signed up to join the army, the production movement is also being intensified, and farmers are quickly paying their agricultural taxes.

    According to the government's lenient policy, puppet soldiers who return to the motherland can also be allocated land, which has led many parents of puppet soldiers to persuade their sons to return to the motherland's side. In the five days up to February 20th, 60 puppet soldiers returned to the resistance camp in Nam Định province alone. They pledged to actively participate in various resistance efforts to show their gratitude to the government.

    越南各省人民政权机关积极执行土地政策
    【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十七日讯：越南许多省的人民政权机关最近积极执行越南政府的土地政策，把法国殖民者和越南卖国贼的土地分配给贫农。
    在南定省，约有七千亩属于越南卖国贼或不在地主的土地，已经分配给或者暂时交给贫农、军人家属、残废军人家属和烈士家属耕种。在河南省，已有三百三十四亩属于法国殖民者的土地分配给贫农。在安老村，当所有敌伪组织和行政机关都被打垮以后，当地的人民政权和人民组织立刻实行政府的土地政策。他们把所有的公地都分配给贫农，并把属于不在地主的六十四亩土地暂时交给农民耕种。这就使得村内的各种抗战工作得到进一步的开展。许多青年已报名参军，生产运动也在加紧进行，农民很快地缴纳了农业税。
    根据政府的宽大政策，回到祖国的伪军也可以分到土地，这使得许多伪军的父母都去劝他们的儿子回到祖国方面来。到二月二十日为止的五天中，仅在南定省就有六十名伪军回到抗战阵营来。他们保证积极参加各种抗战工作，以表示对政府的感激。
