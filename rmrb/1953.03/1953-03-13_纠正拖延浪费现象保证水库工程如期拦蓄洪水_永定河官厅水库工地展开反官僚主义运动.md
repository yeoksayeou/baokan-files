Xinhua News Agency report: An upward criticism and self-examination campaign is currently underway at the Guanting Reservoir construction site of the Yongding River. The aim is to examine the bureaucratic work style of the engineering leadership and responsible cadres, correct delays and waste in construction, and accelerate the progress of the project to ensure that the Guanting Reservoir project impounds floodwaters before the flood season this year.

The Guanting Reservoir project commenced in October 1951. Over the past year, construction has been slow, and many specific projects have been repeatedly delayed, preventing the entire project from being completed on schedule according to the original plan. In particular, the completion date of the water diversion tunnel, one of the three major projects, was delayed by three months compared to the original plan, directly affecting the excavation of the dam foundation. Workers, laborers, and technical cadres involved in the construction had raised concerns about this phenomenon on numerous occasions. At the Workers' Representative Conference held by the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau in January 1953, worker representatives submitted 507 criticisms and suggestions. On February 5th, the Beijing People's Daily also criticized the serious situation of slow project progress and significant waste. Since then, the Guanting Reservoir Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has mobilized the vast majority of employees at the construction site to launch a democratic inspection campaign.

During the inspection, workers, laborers, and technical cadres from various construction units universally exposed the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau, who usually disregarded the opinions of the masses, failed to conduct thorough inspections of work, and failed to address problems promptly after they were discovered. Last spring, when building small earth dams for drainage ditches on the mountain slope above the water diversion tunnel, workers suggested that the flash floods were rapid, and the small earth dams were not safe without impermeable walls. However, the commanding cadres ignored the workers' suggestions and forced construction. During a heavy rain on the night of June 29th last year, the earth dam was washed away, and holes appeared in the dam body. It was only after an emergency rescue that the situation was turned around. For example, an electric motor section's 75-horsepower generator normally used 24 gallons of oil per day, but at that time it was using 36 gallons per day. When workers discovered that the machine was leaking oil severely and requested repairs, the engineering commanding cadres did nothing to resolve the issue, simply watching the oil spill all over the ground. The most serious issue was the suggestion box set up on the construction site of the Third Construction Team, which had not been opened for years. It was recently shattered by the blasting of rocks, revealing that the suggestion box was filled with letters from the masses, including diagrams drawn by employees with opinions on the engineering design. In particular, employees raised the most criticisms about the lack of overall planning for the project, designs lagging behind construction, and the serious phenomenon of rework and wasted work hours. For example, due to the lack of careful responsibility on the part of the construction commanding cadres, the 1952 engineering plan was revised three times. The first quarter engineering progress plan for 1953 was not announced until February 17th, one and a half months after construction had started. The grating groove project for the water inlet tower of the water diversion tunnel could have been completed in four or five days, but due to work stoppages awaiting materials and three changes to the design drawings, it was ultimately delayed for seventeen days. The Second Construction Team and the Third Construction Team lived in the same courtyard, but there was no communication between them during construction. The Third Construction Team excavated the spillway and used dump trucks to transport the rock debris, while the Second Construction Team, which needed rock debris for dam construction, called hundreds of workers to carry it back. The most ridiculous thing was that the foremen did not know the construction plan, and the workers did not understand what they were supposed to do. As a result, labor efficiency became lower and lower. According to the Engineering Bureau's statistics, the average efficiency of earthwork for laborers was as low as 0.5 cubic meters or less.

Based on these serious problems uncovered during the inspection, Wang Sen, the acting director of the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau, made a special call to cadres and all employees of the entire bureau to further deepen the anti-bureaucracy campaign, correct mistakes, and ensure the timely completion of the project progress indicated by the State Council of the Central People's Government, so as to impound floodwaters before the flood season this year. The leading cadres of the Engineering Bureau are currently being adjusted. Regarding the criticisms and opinions from the masses, they have been dealt with according to the specific circumstances. Those that can be handled immediately are being handled, and those that are delayed or cannot be handled are being publicly answered to the employees. The Guanting Reservoir project is also strengthening the work of the engineering inspection office, establishing dedicated personnel to receive letters and visits from the masses, and reforming the previous unreasonable organizations.

Due to the development of the democratic movement, the confidence of the vast majority of employees at the Guanting Reservoir construction site in completing the project on schedule has been greatly enhanced. Currently, more than 16,000 technicians and laborers on the construction site are working intensely to clear the dam foundation, excavate the spillway, and construct the stilling basin of the water diversion tunnel. The sound of motors and pneumatic drills on the construction site can be heard day and night.

    纠正拖延浪费现象保证水库工程如期拦蓄洪水
    永定河官厅水库工地展开反官僚主义运动
    据新华社讯：永定河官厅水库工地上，现正展开自下而上的批评检查运动，检查工程领导机关和负责干部的官僚主义作风，纠正施工中的拖延浪费现象，并正加速工程进展，保证官厅水库工程在今年伏汛前拦蓄洪水。
    官厅水库工程是在一九五一年十月开工的。一年多来，施工缓慢，不少具体工程一再拖延，使整个工程未能按照原计划如期完工。其中特别是三大主要工程之一的输水隧洞，完工日期较原计划拖后三个月，直接影响拦河坝基础的开挖。对这种现象，参加施工的工人、民工和技术干部早就多次提出意见，一九五三年一月官厅水库工程局召开的工人代表大会上，工人代表们提出批评建议达五百零七件。二月五日，北京人民日报也曾对工程进展缓慢浪费很大的严重状况提出批评。自此，中共官厅水库委员会便发动工地广大员工，展开民主检查运动。
    检查中各施工单位的工人、民工和技术干部普遍揭露官厅水库工程局领导干部的官僚主义作风，平时不重视群众意见，不深入检查工作，问题发现后，不及时处理。去年春，在输水隧洞上面山坡建筑山沟排水小土坝时，当时工人提出意见说，山洪暴发较急，小土坝没隔水墙不保险。可是指挥干部对工人的建议置之不理，强制施工；去年六月二十九日夜一场大雨，冲毁土坝，坝身出现洞穴，经紧急抢险，才转危为安。又如机电科的一部七十五马力的发电机，每日的正常用油量是二十四加仑，而当时每日用到三十六加仑，工人发现机器漏油厉害，提请修理时，工程指挥干部不加解决，就看着油流满地。最严重的是第三施工所在工地上设立的意见箱，积年不开，最近因放炮炸石头，才把这个意见箱震碎了，发现意见箱里塞满了群众来信，里面还有员工们对工程设计上的意见划出来的图表。特别是工程缺乏统盘计划，设计落后于施工，返工窝工的严重现象，员工们提出的批评意见最多。如因施工指挥干部不慎重负责，一九五二年的工程计划就修改了三次。一九五三年的第一季度工程进度计划，直到开工一个半月后的二月十七日才公布。输水隧洞进水塔的格栅槽工程本来需四、五天就可以作完，由于停工待料，设计图连换了三张，最后拖延了十七天才完工。第二施工所和第三施工所住在一个院里，但施工中互不联系，第三施工所开挖溢洪道将石碴用斗车推出去，第二施工所筑坝正需要石碴，又叫几百个工人挑回来。最滑稽的是领工人员不知施工计划，工人也就不明白自己该怎样做。这样，劳动效率愈来愈低，据工程局统计，民工的土方平均效率低到零点五立方公尺以下。
    根据检查出的这些严重问题，官厅水库工程局代理局长王森特号召全局干部、全体员工进一步深入展开反官僚主义运动，纠正错误，以保证按期完成中央人民政府政务院所指示的工程进度，在今年伏汛前起拦洪作用。工程局的领导干部现在正在调整中，对于来自群众的批评和意见，已分别情况，能办的立即办，缓办或不能办的，都向员工们公开答复。官厅水库工程并正加强工程检查室工作，设立专人接待群众来信来访，改革以往不合理的机构。
    由于民主运动的开展，官厅水库工地上的广大员工对如期完工的信心已经大大增强。现在，工地上的一万六千多技工、民工，正紧张地清理拦河坝基础、开挖溢洪道和输水隧洞的静水池等工程。工地上的马达声和风钻声昼夜不停。
