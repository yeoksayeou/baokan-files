Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 11th: China's first automated and largest blast furnace—the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 8 Blast Furnace—was ignited at 9:00 PM on the 9th and produced its first batch of molten iron at 10:12 AM on the 11th. After testing, the molten iron was found to be of excellent quality.

When the preparations for the No. 8 Blast Furnace were completed and it was about to be ignited, the workers of Anshan suddenly heard the unfortunate news of the passing of Comrade Stalin, the revolutionary teacher of the world's working people. However, the staff working at the No. 8 Blast Furnace, enduring their grief and wiping away their tears, resolutely carried out the ignition work according to the plan. After ignition, the staff worked day and night on various iron-making tasks, waiting for the furnace, rebuilt with the care of Comrade Stalin and the help of the Soviet people and Soviet experts, to produce iron.

On the morning of the 11th, visitors began to flock to the blast furnace. The bell rang, and the moment for the furnace, equipped with Soviet automated equipment, to produce iron had arrived. The furnace workers quickly lined up and stood on both sides of the iron ditch. When the steel drill struck the taphole, in that tense moment, the red-hot molten iron fiercely sprayed out, flowing smoothly down the iron ditch.

The molten iron flowed smoothly to the end. Workers and technicians unanimously exclaimed, "The first batch of iron from the newly built blast furnace is so good—something never seen before!"

The staff of the ironmaking construction site and the workers of the ironmaking plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company wrote letters to Chairman Mao on the 9th and 11th respectively, reporting the good news of the No. 8 Blast Furnace producing iron.

    鞍钢第八号炼铁炉出铁
    第一炉铁水经过化验质量很好
    【新华社鞍山十一日电】我国第一个自动化的、最大的炼铁炉——国营鞍山钢铁公司第八号炼铁炉已在九日午后九时点火，并在十一日上午十时十二分出了第一炉铁水。铁水经过化验，质量很好。
    当第八高炉的准备工作完成，即将点火的时候，鞍山工人突然听到了世界劳动人民革命导师斯大林同志逝世的不幸消息，但是在第八号高炉工作的职工，忍着悲痛，擦干眼泪，坚决按照计划进行了点火工作。点火后，职工们日夜进行着各种有关炼铁的工作，等待这座由于斯大林同志的关怀和苏联人民以及苏联专家的帮助而改建成功的高炉出铁。
    十一日上午，参观的人就开始向这座高炉涌去。钟声响起来，这座安装着苏联自动化设备的高炉出铁的时刻到了。炉前工人迅速地排列成行，站到铁沟两旁。当钢钻向出铁口冲撞时，紧张的一霎那间，通红的铁水猛烈地喷射出来，沿着铁沟滚滚地畅流而下。
    铁水顺利地流完了。工人和技术人员都不约而同的赞叹起来说：“新建的炼铁炉第一炉出的铁就这样好，是从来没有看到过的！”
    鞍山钢铁公司铁化工地的职工和炼铁厂的职工已在九日和十一日分别写信给毛主席报告第八高炉出铁的喜讯。
