Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 27th: From March 25th to 26th, most parts of Northwest China experienced rain and snow. The largest rainfall occurred in the Longnan region of Gansu Province and the Guanzhong region of Shaanxi Province. Minxian reached 13 millimeters, Tianshui 8 millimeters, and Xi'an 11 millimeters. Following these were Yan'an and Yulin in northern Shaanxi Province, and Yinchuan in Ningxia Province, all with 5 to 6 millimeters. There was also light rain in Xining, along the Yellow River, and other areas of Qinghai Province.

Last winter, rainfall and snowfall were scarce in most parts of Northwest China. This rain and snow, except for a slight impact on early-maturing winter wheat in the Guanzhong region of Shaanxi Province, is extremely beneficial for spring plowing and sowing in the spring wheat and cotton regions. It can also eliminate early pests such as wheat aphids and red spiders.

Currently, agricultural and forestry departments at all levels in Northwest China have notified all regions that they should seize the opportunity to prepare the land, conserve moisture, and sow crops according to the soil moisture content. In particular, areas with poor harvests last autumn should immediately sow early-maturing short-season crops to eliminate the spring famine. Winter wheat areas should prepare firewood and kindling early to guard against late frost disasters after the rain.

    西北大部地区下了雨雪
    各地应抓紧整地播种
    【新华社西安二十七日电】三月二十五日至二十六日，西北大部地区下了雨雪。雨量最大的是甘肃省陇南地区和陕西省关中地区，岷县达十三公厘，天水八公厘，西安十一公厘。其次是陕西省北部延安、榆林和宁夏省银川，都有五公厘至六公厘。青海省西宁、黄河沿等地也有微雨。
    去年冬天西北大部地区雨雪稀少。这次雨雪，除对陕西省关中地区早熟的冬小麦稍有影响外，极有利于春小麦区和棉区的春耕播种，并可消灭麦蚜虫、红蜘蛛等早期虫害。
    现在，西北各级人民政府农林部门已通知各地，应抓紧时机整地保墒和藉墒播种，尤其是去秋薄收地区应即时播种早熟的小日月庄稼，消灭春荒；冬麦地区应及早准备柴草烟火，提防雨后的晚霜灾害。
