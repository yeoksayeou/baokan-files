Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 17th (TASS): The Czechoslovak News Agency broadcast the pathological autopsy report of Klement Gottwald's remains.

    The pathological autopsy proved: arteriosclerosis, mainly the aorta with huge changes. These changes caused the rupture of the aortic wall, resulting in bleeding in the left chest cavity and mediastinum. The gradual increase of internal bleeding obstructed the cardiovascular system, resulting in death.

    The symptoms of pneumonia and pleurisy (formerly translated as pleuritis), which were determined in the early stage of the illness, were caused by the beginning of blood invading the chest and the reactive changes in the lungs and chest.

    The pathological autopsy fully confirmed the correctness of the clinical diagnosis.

    The medical measures were correct, but due to the severity of the condition, a fatal outcome could not be avoided.

    The pathological autopsy report was signed by the following persons: Professor V. Jedlicka, Lecturer B. Na. Uskov, Master of Medical Sciences N. P. Vorshanova, Master of Medical Sciences A. S. Pavlov, Dr. R. Vanieczek, and Director of the National Sanatorium F. Závodny.

    哥特瓦尔德遗体的病理解剖检查报告
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社布拉格十七日电：捷克斯洛伐克通讯社广播克利门特·哥特瓦尔德遗体的病理解剖检查报告。
    病理解剖检查证明：血管硬化，主要是主动脉有巨大变化。这些变化引起主动脉壁的破裂，造成左胸腔和纵隔障的溢血。内溢血的逐渐加剧使心脏血管系统受到障碍，结果造成了死亡。
    在患病初期就断定的肺炎和胸膜炎（前译肋膜炎）症状是由于血液开始侵入胸膛以及肺和胸膛中的反应性变化引起的。
    病理解剖检查完全证实了临床诊断的正确性。
    医疗措施是正确的，然而由于病情的严重，就无法避免致命的结果。
    病理解剖检查报告由下列数人签名：维·叶德利茨卡教授，布·纳·乌斯科夫讲师，医药科学硕士纳·普·沃沙诺瓦，医药科学硕士阿·斯·巴夫洛夫，鲁·瓦涅泽克博士和国家疗养院院长弗·扎沃德尼博士。
