Comrades, measurement workers, drilling workers, mechanics, engineering technicians, management personnel, supply workers, political workers, and other workers involved in railway survey and design:

You are soldiers standing on the front lines of railway construction. I extend my respects to you on behalf of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government.

At a time when our country is beginning large-scale economic construction, our railway survey and design troops are undertaking extremely arduous work. Comrades, across the country, from the Greater Khingan Mountains to the Qinling Mountains, from the Qilian Mountains to the mountainous areas of the Southwest, from coastal areas to plateau regions, facing primeval forests, the Gobi Desert, high mountains and great rivers, enduring the summer heat and winter cold, you persist in your work in sparsely populated areas with inconvenient transportation and difficult living conditions, surveying geography, measuring terrain, drilling geology, selecting and designing new railway lines, and striving to prepare for the large-scale construction of new railways for the country.

Everyone knows that what you comrades are doing is arduous and heavy work, but following behind you are the large armies of railway construction. In a few years, railways will be built in the places you have passed, following in your footsteps, and mines, factories, and new cities will appear along the railway lines. The new railways will connect new mines, factories, and cities with other major cities and transportation hubs across the country, transporting minerals, timber, and various industrial and agricultural products, as well as the flow of working people. This is a vision that will surely be realized soon. From this, it also shows that our country's economic and defense strength is constantly growing. When you are working hard and struggling with difficulties, thinking about the prospects for railway construction in our motherland and that you are the pioneers of the railway construction cause, I believe you will feel great pleasure and encouragement.

Railway design work is the pioneer of railway construction. The quality of design work not only determines the size of the construction cost of a new road but also determines the value of a railway's future contribution to the country and the people. Selecting a good route that is both flat and convenient can not only save construction costs but also increase the volume of transportation and reduce transportation costs for a long time to come, permanently benefiting the people. Conversely, selecting a bad route like a goat trail will not only increase construction costs but also result in a small volume of transportation and an inability to make ends meet during long-term operations, becoming a heavy burden on the people, like the Baotian Railway designed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. These are the two different outcomes that railway design work can create.

Of course, the naturally formed surface of the earth is sometimes flatter and sometimes more dangerous. People cannot yet control it. However, where it is easy to walk and where it is difficult to walk, whether to plan to go from there or not to go from there, this power is entirely in the hands of the people. Any terrain will have a relatively easy route. Saying "the road to Shu is difficult, more difficult than ascending to the blue sky" and saying "the natural barrier cannot be crossed" are exaggerations of natural difficulties. In any difficult area, through human practice, a relatively reasonable route can always be found. Therefore, doing a good job in survey and design work and selecting a good route requires not only the necessary knowledge and experience but, more importantly, practice. Applying our knowledge and improving our knowledge through practice. This means that doing survey work requires attention to investigation and research, collecting all possible information, including historical records and legends, opinions from local governments and transportation, water conservancy, geology, and other research institutions, visiting villagers, including the elderly, young people, and passing travelers, carefully surveying, measuring, drilling, designing, mobilizing all survey and design personnel, launching rationalization proposals, and making several plans from all the data, comparing and analyzing, repeatedly studying, and finally selecting the most reasonable and economical route from among them. This is a process of practicing through the masses and concentrating the wisdom of the masses. It is also the best way for us to carry out survey and design work.

Those who have adopted this method for survey and design work have achieved relatively good results. For example, the Tiancheng South Section Route Selection Committee, including model engineers Comrades Guo Yi and Lan Tian, paid attention to investigation and research and adopted a method of careful analysis and comparison, overturning the previously selected route and selecting a new line, shortening the mileage and avoiding the difficult engineering of several high bridges and long tunnels, thus greatly saving the country's investment. Also, the Fifth Detachment of the Lansu Survey Team adopted the same method, crossed the plateau area of the Hexi Corridor, and selected a relatively stable route, which also shortened the distance by thirteen kilometers. Furthermore, drilling workers Han Yun and Chen Yuxiu, and mechanical worker Ma Wenliang and other comrades, modified the drill bit of the hand-cranked drilling machine, enabling it not only to drill through rock formations and extract cores but also to improve drilling efficiency and replace motorized drilling machines, which greatly reduced the difficulty of transporting machines in mountainous areas. Other teams also have many good examples. We must promote these good methods created by the comrades.

The examples just mentioned can illustrate that survey and design work is a very scientific work and also a very troublesome and meticulous work. Therefore, it is necessary to have an honest, down-to-earth, and realistic scientific attitude to do a good job in design work. Conversely, being afraid of trouble, being afraid of trouble, and adopting a sloppy, careless, bureaucratic attitude will certainly not be able to select a good route.

Today we are at the beginning of large-scale economic construction. Not only do we already have a large number of design teams working, but even more design teams are about to start working. The task assigned to us by the people is great, the people's hopes for us are high, and therefore the requirements for us are also high. We must adopt a serious, responsible, honest, and down-to-earth scientific attitude to treat our work and respond to the people's ardent hopes. If we do good things for the people, the people will not forget us.

Comrades! We are born in the great Mao Zedong era. We have the opportunity to freely exert our knowledge and wisdom, and our knowledge and wisdom are used collectively. We also have the advanced experience of the Soviet Union for us to learn from. We have every possibility to create miracles in any scientific field. Our design work can also create good results. The people need us to do this, and we must do it. This is our glorious mission. Finally, I wish the comrades success and progress in their work! I wish the comrades good health and happiness!

    在复杂的地形中选出经济的合理的线路来
    ——中央人民政府铁道部副部长吕正操在中央人民广播电台对全国铁路勘测设计员工的广播词铁路勘测设计的测量工、钻探工、机械工、工程技术人员、管理人员、供应工作者、政治工作者及其他工作的同志们：
    你们是站在铁路建设最前线的战士，我代表中央人民政府铁道部向你们致敬。
    正当我国开始大规模经济建设的时候，我们铁路的勘测设计部队，担负着非常艰巨的工作。同志们在全国范围内，从兴安岭到秦岭，从祁连山脉到西南山区，从沿海地区到高原地带，面对着原始森林，戈壁沙漠，高山大河，忍受着夏天的酷热，冬天的严寒，在人烟稀少，交通不便，吃喝困难的环境中坚持工作，考察地理，测量地形，钻探地质，选择和设计新的铁路线，为国家准备大规模建筑新铁路而奋斗。
    谁都知道，同志们所做的是一件辛苦而又繁重的工作，但是跟在同志们后边的，就是铁路工程大军。几年之后，就要在你们走过的地方，顺着你们的脚印，修成一条一条的铁路，在铁路经过的地方，出现矿山、工厂和新的城市。新的铁路把新的矿山、工厂、城市和全国其他的大城市、交通要道联结起来，川流不息地运送着矿产、木材和各种工业品、农产品，以及来来往往的劳动人民。这是不久一定要实现的远景，从这里，也就说明了我国的经济力量和国防力量正在不断的增长，当你们辛勤劳苦地和困难搏斗的时候，想到我们祖国铁路建设的远景，想到你们正是铁道建设事业的开路先锋，我相信，你们一定会感到极大的愉快和鼓舞。
    铁路设计工作，是铁路建设的开路先锋。设计工作的好坏，不仅决定一条新路建筑费的大小，而且决定一条铁路将来的对国家对人民贡献的价值。选定一条既平坦又便捷的好路线，不仅可以节省建筑费，而且在将来长时期又可以增大运输量，减低运输成本，永久为人民造福利；相反地，选定一条羊肠小道的坏线路，不仅会增大建筑费，而且会在长时期营业当中，运量很小，入不敷出，像国民党反动派设计的宝天路一样，成为人民的一个沉重的负担。这就是铁路设计工作可能造成的两种不同的结局。
    当然，自然构成的地表面形势，有的平些，有的险些，人们还不可能来控制它，但是，那里好走，那里难走，打算从那里走或者不从那里走，这个权柄完全掌握在人们的手里。任何地形都会有一条比较好走的线路，说“蜀道难，难于上青天”，说“天堑不可飞渡”，都是对自然困难的夸张，在任何困难的地区，通过了人的实践，总可以找出比较合理的线路。因此做好勘测设计工作，选出一条好的线路，不仅是要有必不可少的知识和经验，更重要的，还是实践。从实践当中运用我们的知识，提高我们的知识。这就是说做勘测工作，必须注重调查研究，搜集一切可能搜集到的资料，包括古今记载传说的资料，地方政府和交通、水利、地质以及其他研究机关的意见，访问老乡，包括老年人、青年人以及来往的行旅，认真勘察、测量、钻探、设计，发动全体勘测设计人员，开展合理化建议，把所有的资料，做出若干方案，比较分析，反复研究，最后从中间选出一条最合理最经济的线路。这是一个通过群众的实践，集中群众智慧的过程。也就是我们进行勘测设计工作的最好方法。
    凡是采取这种方法进行勘测设计工作的，就取得了比较良好的成绩。例如天成南段选线委员会，其中有模范工程师郭彝、蓝田两位同志，他们注意了调查研究，采取了仔细分析比较的方法，推翻了过去已经选定的线路，选出了一条新线，缩短了里程，避免了若干高桥、长洞的困难工程，因而大大节省了国家的投资。还有兰肃测量队第五分队采取了同样的方法，越过了河西走廊的高原地带，选出了一条比较平稳的线路，而且缩短了十三公里。又如钻探工人韩云、陈玉秀，机械工人马文良等几位同志改造了手摇钻探机的钻头，使它不仅能够钻透岩层，取出岩心，而且提高了钻探效率，还能代替机动钻探机，这就大大地减轻了山地搬运机器的困难。其他的队也有许多好的例子。我们必须把同志们创造出来的这些好方法好好推广。
    刚才举的几个例子可以说明：勘测设计工作是一门很科学的工作，也是一个很麻烦很细致的工作。因此要有老老实实、实事求是的科学态度，才能把设计工作做好。反之，怕麻烦，怕费事，采取马马虎虎、粗枝大叶的官僚主义的态度，一定不可能选出来好的线路。
    今天我们是处在大规模经济建设开始的时候，不仅已经有大批的设计部队正在工作，而且还有更多的设计部队就要开始工作，人民交给我们的任务很大，人民对我们的希望很高，因而对我们的要求也很高，我们一定要采取认真负责老老实实的科学态度来对待我们的工作，来回答人民的热望。我们给人民做了好事，人民是忘不了我们的。
    同志们！我们生在伟大的毛泽东时代，我们有机会可以自由发挥我们的知识和智慧，而我们的知识和智慧又是被集体来运用的，我们又有苏联的先进经验，供我们学习。我们有一切可能，在任何科学部门中创造出奇迹来，我们的设计工作也同样可以创造出好的成绩来，人民需要我们这样做，我们就一定要这样做，这就是我们的光荣任务。最后我祝同志们在工作中胜利！进步！祝同志们健康！愉快！
