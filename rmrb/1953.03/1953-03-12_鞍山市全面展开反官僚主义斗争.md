Anshan City is carrying out a comprehensive struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline under the leadership of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The leading bodies of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the CPC, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the Municipal People's Government are now, on the one hand, extensively listening to criticisms and suggestions from cadres and the masses of various units, and on the other hand, actively preparing to organize inspection teams in conjunction with current work to carry out inspections with a focus.

The struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in Anshan City began after this newspaper exposed the phenomenon of the Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper encountering serious obstruction from bureaucrats in carrying out criticism on February 6th. Through this exposure, the leading comrades of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the CPC further recognized the serious bureaucratic phenomena existing in their leadership work, thus strengthening their determination to launch a city-wide struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in accordance with the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau. In addition to studying this newspaper's criticism, the Municipal Committee notified the Party organizations of all departments in Anshan City to study this criticism and related documents. On February 18th, the Municipal Committee convened a city-wide conference of Party member cadres, where Comrade Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Municipal Committee, delivered a mobilization report to the conference and conducted self-criticism. After the meeting, cadres from the Party committees, administrative organs, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations at the factory and mine levels were organized into twenty-four groups to discuss Comrade Han Tianshi's report and conduct bottom-up criticism of the Municipal Committee and other municipal-level leading bodies. At the same time, the Municipal Committee instructed relevant departments to promptly and conscientiously handle letters from the people (including rationalization proposals from employees), establish people's reception rooms, and mobilize the broad masses to expose and struggle against the phenomenon of suppressing criticism. The municipal-level leading bodies, centered on the Municipal Committee, listened to everyone's criticisms while conducting self-criticism. Thus, the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in Anshan City was fully launched. In the twenty days since the mobilization conference, many serious phenomena of bureaucracy, violations of law and discipline, and suppression of criticism have continued to be exposed among municipal-level leading cadres. For example, Feng Kehan, Deputy Minister of the Urban Work Department of the Municipal Committee, blindly listened to the false accusations of counter-revolutionary element Song Zhihe, and without investigation or research, or even asking for reasons, arbitrarily approved the arrest of a transport worker, Zhao Yongqing, and illegally detained him in court for ten months. Li Li, the former director of the Refractory Factory, and Zhang Gang, the Party Committee Secretary, used their positions and powers to suppress criticism and retaliate against critics. In order to cover up the shortcomings in their leadership, they even forced newspaper correspondents to write false news for the newspaper. For another example, recently, in order to "implement the Marriage Law," the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League issued a bewildering array of survey forms to investigate free love, arranged marriages, and the relationship between fathers-in-law and daughters-in-law among citizens and workers, arousing great dissatisfaction among the masses. The bottom-up criticism, centered on inspecting municipal-level leaders, began on February 18th and basically came to an end by the end of February. The Municipal Committee is now conducting systematic inspections on some major issues based on everyone's criticisms, and it is expected that this stage will be completed before mid-March. After mid-March, the municipal-level leading bodies will, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Committee, move into inspection work, and through inspection work, deepen the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.

To do this work well, the Municipal Committee held several meetings at the end of February for discussion. The Municipal Committee believes that further inspection of the preparatory work for this year's capital construction, and a focused inspection of certain serious waste phenomena and the implementation of economic accounting in last year's capital construction, should be the central content of the inspection work. Production factories, mines, and other organs should also, in conjunction with current work, seize the main problems in the current work and conduct an inspection recently. In the inspection of these departments, the Municipal Committee believes that it is necessary to first expose the bad phenomena of suppressing criticism, launch full criticism and self-criticism, and oppose the bureaucratic attitude towards the anti-bureaucracy struggle. Secondly, the discovery of problems should be closely linked with solving problems, and the bureaucratic style of dragging on and failing to solve problems should be opposed. At present, the Anshan Municipal Committee and Anshan Iron and Steel Company have transferred more than two hundred people to form five professional inspection teams to go deep into various capital construction departments and comprehensively inspect the preparations for this year's capital construction. After completing this inspection, the Municipal Committee and the Iron and Steel Company plan to immediately mobilize all employees to discuss this year's capital construction plan and conduct a more in-depth mass inspection of the specific preparations for this year's capital construction.

    鞍山市全面展开反官僚主义斗争
    鞍山市反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，在中共鞍山市委的领导下，已全面展开。现在中共鞍山市委、鞍山钢铁公司及市人民政府领导机关，正一面广泛听取来自各单位干部及群众的批评、建议，一面积极准备结合当前工作，组织检查组，有重点地进行检查工作。
    鞍山市的反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，是从二月六日本报揭发了鞍山“工人生活”报在开展批评中遭受官僚主义者严重阻碍的现象后开始的。通过这个揭发，中共鞍山市委领导方面，进一步认识了他们领导工作中存在着严重的官僚主义现象，从而更加下定了决心，依照中共中央与东北局的指示，在全市展开反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争。市委除对本报的批评进行学习外，并通知鞍山市各部门党的组织，对这个批评和有关的文件，进行了学习。二月十八日，市委又召开了全市党员干部大会，由市委书记韩天石同志向大会作了动员报告，并进行自我检讨。会后，全市厂矿级以上的党委、行政、工会、青年团的干部，组织成二十四个小组，讨论韩天石同志的报告，并对市委及其他市级领导机关进行自下而上的批评。与此同时市委又指示各有关部门迅速认真处理人民来信（包括职工同志的合理化建议），建立人民接待室，吸收广大群众，向压制批评的现象进行揭发和斗争。而市级领导机关，则以市委为中心，一面听取大家的批评，一面进行自我批评。至此，鞍山市的反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，即全面展开。自召开动员大会以来的二十天中，在市级领导干部中，又继续揭发出许多严重的官僚主义、违法乱纪和压制批评的现象。如市委城工部副部长封克涵，盲目听信反革命分子宋志和的诬告，不调查不研究，也不问情由，即随便批准把一运输工人赵永清逮捕，在法院非法扣押了十个月。前耐火厂厂长李力，党委书记张纲，利用职权压制批评和打击批评者，为了掩盖其领导中的缺点，竟强迫报纸通讯员给报纸写假新闻。再如最近青年团市工委为了要“贯彻婚姻法”，竟发下了一种名目繁多的调查表，调查在市民和工人群众中自由恋爱、买卖婚姻和公公与儿媳妇的关系等，引起群众的极大不满。以检查市级领导为中心的自下而上的批评，从二月十八日开始，到二月底已基本告一段落。现市委正根据大家的批评在一些主要问题上，进行系统的检查，预计这个阶段在三月中旬以前即可结束。三月中旬之后，市级领导机关将在市委的统一领导下，转入检查工作，通过检查工作，把反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争更加深入一步。为做好这
    一工作，市委于二月末召开数次会议，进行讨论。市委认为，进一步检查今年基本建设的准备工作，与有重点地检查去年基本建设中某些严重的浪费现象和经济核算的执行情况，应作为检查工作的中心内容。而生产厂矿与其他机关，亦应在最近结合当前工作，抓住当前工作中的主要问题进行一次检查。在这些部门的检查中，市委认为必须首先揭发压制批评的恶劣现象，展开充分的批评与自我批评，反对以官僚主义态度对待反官僚主义斗争。其次，应把发现问题和解决问题密切结合起来，反对拖拖拉拉不解决问题的官僚主义作风。目前，鞍山市委和鞍山钢铁公司，已抽调了二百余人，组织了五个专业检查组，深入各基本建设部门，全面检查今年基本建设的准备工作。在完成这一检查之后，市委及钢铁公司准备立即发动全体职工，讨论今年基本建设计划，对今年基本建设的各项具体准备工作，进行一次更深入的群众性的大检查。
