Benxi Coal and Iron Company Conducts Large-Scale Iron Ore Drilling Work
Shaanxi No. 1004 Drilling Team Creates New National Petroleum Drilling Record

To rapidly develop China's steel industry, Benxi Coal and Iron Company organized a strong drilling team and, starting from February 6th, launched a large-scale iron ore drilling project at a construction site in Benxi. To obtain particularly detailed and complete data from the drilling, the density of exploration wells drilled at the site is very high, and borehole exploration is also being carried out. After the start of work, the drilling team implemented the Soviet advanced experience - the one-time drill bit supply method, and in March began to trial the use of project progress charts and material supply charts. The drilling team also established a special amateur school to conduct regular technical studies. It is expected that all drilling work will be completed before the end of August this year.

In the area where the drilling team is working, iron deposits are very rich, and the ore layers are mostly above ground level, allowing for open-pit mining. Since 1950, Benxi Coal and Iron Company has successively conducted several surveys and measurements with the Nanjing Geological Survey Institute and the Changchun Geological Survey Institute. Since August of last year, the company has also vigorously cultivated drilling workers, strengthened the drilling team's cadres, purchased a large number of drilling tools and materials, and carried out work such as installing water pipes, repairing roads, and digging power pole pits.

Xinhua News Agency: The Shaanxi No. 1004 Drilling Team of the Northwest Petroleum Administration, learning from Soviet advanced experience, created a new national petroleum drilling record of 109.49 meters per day during the drilling of the No. 7 well, which is one thousand meters deep. At the same time, it also created a record of safely drilling 406.9 meters in ten days without accidents.

Since 1952, the Shaanxi No. 1004 Drilling Team has mobilized the entire team of drillers to learn from Soviet advanced experience and study the technology of rapid and safe drilling. Therefore, the drilling speed has continuously increased, and each well has successively created new records ranging from 37 meters to 95 meters per day. After October 1952, the team summarized the experiences of the previous period and comprehensively learned from the advanced experience of Soviet drilling projects. Geological staff took the initiative to draw geological profile maps and analyzed the possible drillability of the strata. The team's technical personnel went deep into the field, combined with geological conditions, studied the performance of the main drilling tools, and determined the technical operating principles, thereby avoiding the possibility of engineering accidents caused by bit bouncing in the past. Finally, the Soviet "pressure test and inspection drill pipe method" was used to comprehensively check technical safety measures. Therefore, after drilling began, all operations were relatively smooth. By December 23rd of last year, the team had created a new national record of 109.49 meters per day. In December of last year, the drilling rig's monthly speed and average daily footage of the No. 7 well increased by 2.32 times compared to the plan, and the drill bit utilization efficiency increased by 60 percent.

    本溪煤铁公司大规模进行铁矿钻探工作
    陕北第一零零四钻探队创造全国石油钻探新纪录
    为了迅速发展我国的钢铁工业，本溪煤铁公司组织了强大的钻探队，从二月六日起，在本溪某工地展开了规模巨大的铁矿钻探工程。为了使钻探取得的资料特别详尽完善，在该工地所钻探的探井密度很大，同时还进行了洞探。在开工后，钻探队推行了苏联先进经验——一次钻粒供给法，三月份起又开始试行了工程进度指示图表和材料供应指示图表。钻探队还成立了专门的业余学校，进行经常性的技术学习。预计全部钻探工程在今年八月底以前可以完成。
    在钻探队工作的地区，铁的埋藏量很丰富，矿层多在地平面以上，可以进行露天开采。从一九五○年起，本溪煤铁公司已和南京地质调查所、长春地质调查所先后进行了数次勘察和测量。从去年八月起，该公司又大力培养了钻探工人，充实了钻探队的干部，购制了大批钻探工具和材料，并进行了安水管、修公路、挖电线杆坑等工作。

    西北石油管理局陕北第一零零四钻探队学习苏联先进经验，在钻探第七号一千公尺深井工程时，创造了日进一百零九点四九公尺的全国石油钻探最高纪录，同时并创造了十天安全钻进四百零六点九公尺无事故的纪录。
    陕北第一零零四钻探队从一九五二年开始，就发动全队钻工学习苏联先进经验，研究快速安全钻进的技术，因此钻进速度不断上升，各井先后创造了日进三十七公尺到九十五公尺的新纪录。一九五二年十月份以后，该队总结了前一时期的经验，全面学习了苏联钻探工程的先进经验。地质工作人员主动绘出地质剖面图，分析了地层的可能钻进性，全队技术人员深入现场，结合地质情况研究了主要钻具的性能，确定了技术操作原则，从而避免了过去因跳钻而造成工程事故的可能性。最后，用苏联“试压检查钻杆法”，通盘检查了技术安全措施。所以在开钻后，一切操作情况都比较顺利。到去年十二月二十三日，该队创造了日进一百零九点四九公尺的全国新纪录。第七号井去年十二月份钻机月速度和平均日进尺都比计划提高二点三二倍，钻头使用效率提高百分之六十。    （新华社）
