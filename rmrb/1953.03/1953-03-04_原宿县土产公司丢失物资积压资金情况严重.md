    Serious Losses of Materials and Accumulation of Funds at the Yuansu County Native Produce Company

    Sun Yankun writes: During the inventory of materials in June last year, the Yuansu County Native Produce Company discovered a shortage of 1,700 large gasoline drums, worth approximately 60 million yuan. They did not actively investigate; in November, they discovered another 30 large oil drums were missing. The Xiguan Purchasing Team under the company purchased 47 pigs in December last year, which all died, causing a loss of over 20 million yuan to the state. However, the company leadership turned a blind eye and did not go to the team to inspect the work. In addition, the company transferred more than 4 million jin of flue-cured tobacco worth more than 24 billion yuan to Shanghai, Shandong, and other places in 1951; however, the accounts were not settled until September 1952, causing a large amount of state funds to be tied up for a year. The company's lack of attention to state property is serious, and the superior company should promptly inspect the company's work.

    原宿县土产公司丢失物资积压资金情况严重
    孙炎堃来信：原宿县土产公司去年六月间清理资材时发现短少大汽油桶一千七百个，价值约六千万元。他们并不积极检查；到十一月又发现丢了三十个大油桶。该公司所属西关收购组在去年十二月收了四十七头毛猪，结果全部死亡，使国家损失二千余万元。但公司领导方面却视若无睹，也不到该组去检查工作。此外，该公司在一九五一年先后调往上海、山东等地烤烟四百多万斤，价值二百四十余亿元；但直到一九五二年九月才将账结清，使国家大批资金积压一年之久。该公司不重视国家财产的情况是严重的，上级公司应该迅速检查该公司工作。
