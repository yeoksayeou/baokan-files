    The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has begun to correct formalism in the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    For more than a year, mutual aid organizations in rural areas of Guizhou have developed in large numbers, achieving the 1952 patriotic agricultural production task, but there has also been a general tendency towards impatience, rash advances, and formalism. Since the beginning of winter last year, although all parts of the province have selected a number of key areas for rectification, the work teams still had problems in their methods during the rectification process, such as being divorced from the masses, divorced from production, not conducting investigation and research and analysis of the situation, and not identifying the key to rectification according to the different problems existing in each mutual aid group. As a result, when the work team was present, the problems disappeared, but when the work team left, the problems reappeared. During the rectification, some places also excessively emphasized the collectivization of labor, opposing members from engaging in individual sideline production during the winter slack season, believing that it was individual farming. They did not understand that farmers in the Guizhou area cannot overcome life's difficulties by relying solely on agricultural labor and must take time to engage in sideline production in winter to overcome these difficulties.
    The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a joint meeting of secretaries of local committees in late February. The meeting required all localities to pay special attention to correcting formalism and preventing impatience and rash advances in the process of rectifying mutual aid groups, to advocate promoting democracy and proceeding from the perspective of production, and to adopt different guidelines and methods for different regions and different types of mutual aid groups to carry out careful rectification.
    When specifically rectifying mutual aid groups, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out that the following steps should be taken: 1. Educate key personnel and explain policies; 2. Strengthen publicity and conduct in-depth investigation and research; 3. Conduct democratic inspections to identify the key; 4. Establish key personnel and improve leadership; 5. Formulate plans and strive for production; 6. Each region should cultivate various types of models based on these methods, to drive the general, so as to ensure the steady development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement throughout the province.

    中共贵州省委员会
    着手纠正农村互助合作运动中的形式主义
    中共贵州省委员会已着手纠正互助合作运动中的形式主义。
    一年多以来，贵州各地农村互助组织发展的数量很大，实现了一九五二年的农业爱国丰产任务，但也普遍存在着急躁冒进和形式主义。去年入冬以后，虽然全省各地都选择了若干重点进行整理，而整理过程中，工作人员在方法上还有毛病，如脱离群众，脱离生产，不调查研究和分析情况，不根据各个互助组存在的不同问题，找出关键进行整理，结果形成工作组在时，问题没有了，工作组一走，问题又发生了。整理中，有些地方还有过分强调劳动集体化的毛病，反对组员利用冬闲进行个人副业生产，认为那样是单干，不了解贵州地区农民光靠农业劳动不能克服生活困难，必须在冬季抽空搞副业生产才能克服生活困难。
    中共贵州省委员会在二月下旬召开了各地方委员会书记联席会议。会议要求各地在整理互助组过程中，特别注意纠正形式主义，防止急躁冒进，提倡发扬民主和从生产观点出发，分别不同地区，不同类型的互助组，采取不同的方针和办法，细致地进行整理。
    在具体整理互助组时，中共贵州省委员会指出应采取下列步骤进行：一、教育骨干，交代政策；二、加强宣传，深入调查研究；三、民主检查，找出关键；四、确立骨干，改善领导；五、订立计划，努力生产；六、各地区据此办法培养各类典型，带动一般，以保证全省农村互助合作运动稳步地发展。（新华社）
