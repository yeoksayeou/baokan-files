    Commemorate the Death of the Great Stalin with Selfless Labor
    Soviet Workers Exceed Production Quotas

    (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 13th) The Soviet people are transforming grief into strength, commemorating the death of their great leader, J.V. Stalin, by intensifying production and working diligently. Workers in many factories in Moscow have organized Stakhanovite work teams. All the workers of the "Hammer and Sickle" Steel Plant have decided to complete the new Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and over-produce thousands of tons of steel and various rolled metals this year to commemorate Stalin. Zhuravlev, a steel rolling worker at the plant, said: In these days, we Moscow metallurgical workers are as saddened as the people of the whole country. However, the grief caused by this irreparable loss cannot frustrate our will. We vow to follow the Party Central Committee of Stalin forever in all matters to accomplish Stalin's great cause.
    At the construction site of the Communist construction project of the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, many workers also participated in Stakhanovite work teams. While their representative, Hero of Socialist Labor, excavator driver Slepukha, was guarding Stalin's coffin in the Hall of Columns of the Trade Union Building in Moscow, Seriyovestov, a Communist Youth League member at the construction site, excavated 3,000 cubic meters of earth in one work shift, exceeding the task by more than double. When work was stopped for five minutes at noon on the 9th to mourn Stalin, excavator driver Duskin on the construction site had just excavated 900 cubic meters of earth. Duskin said: Dear teacher, we bid farewell to you forever! We will gloriously complete the tasks you have set! The lights of the Stalingrad Hydropower Station will shine for a long time on the Soviet land!
    In Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, workers in many factories have pledged to complete their production plans ahead of schedule. Gradiuk, a worker at the Lenin Forging Plant, said: The best way to commemorate our dear leader is to build communism in our country. We warmly respond to the call of Comrades Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov on Red Square. We will respond to the call of our dear Party with selfless labor and tirelessly strengthen the power of our motherland. In these sorrowful days, no one in our factory has failed to exceed the production quota. Hundreds of workers have completed several days' work in one day.
    The Martin furnace of the Stalinsk United Metallurgical Factory conducted high-speed steelmaking more than 100 times from March 1st to 9th. On the 9th alone—the day of Stalin's burial—it conducted 16 times. Somov, a Stalin Prize winner and worker at the factory, said: Dear Stalin is no longer with us. But the great Party he cultivated and his comrades are confidently guiding the Soviet people to communism. On behalf of our production team, I guarantee to over-produce 10,000 tons of metal this year to respond to the call of the Party.

    以忘我的劳动来纪念伟大斯大林逝世
    苏联工人纷纷超额完成生产任务
    【新华社莫斯科十三日电】苏联人民化悲痛为力量，正以加紧生产、努力工作，来纪念伟大领袖约·维·斯大林的逝世。莫斯科的许多工厂的工人都组织了斯塔哈诺夫式工作班。“锤子与镰刀”钢铁厂的全体工人为了纪念斯大林，已决定提前完成新的五年计划，并在今年内超计划多生产数千吨钢和各种压延金属。该厂轧钢工人久热夫说：在这些日子里，我们莫斯科的冶金工人和全国人民一样地悲痛。但是，这个不可补偿的损失所引起的悲痛，并不能挫折我们的意志。我们宣誓：我们要在一切事务上永远跟随斯大林的党中央委员会，来完成斯大林的伟大事业。
    在斯大林格勒水电站的共产主义建设工程工地上，许多工人也参加了斯塔哈诺夫式工作班。当他们的代表、社会主义劳动英雄、挖土机司机斯列普哈在莫斯科的工会大厦圆柱大厅为斯大林守灵时，工地上的一位青年团员谢里维奥斯托夫在一个工作班的时间内，就挖了三千个土方，超过任务一倍以上。在九日正午停工五分钟为斯大林默哀的时候，工地上的挖土机司机杜斯金刚刚挖完九百公方的泥土，杜斯金说：亲爱的导师：我们和你永别了！你所规定的任务，我们一定会光荣地完成！斯大林格勒水电站的灯光，将久远照耀在苏维埃的土地上！
    在乌克兰共和国首都基辅，许多工厂的工人宣誓要提前完成生产计划。列宁锻冶厂的工人格拉久克说：纪念我们亲爱的领袖的最好办法，就是在我国建设共产主义。我们热烈响应马林科夫、贝利亚和莫洛托夫同志在红场上的号召。我们要以忘我的劳动来响应亲爱的党的号召，要不倦地加强祖国的威力。在这些悲痛的日子里，我们厂没有一个人不是超过生产定额的。成百的工人都在一天之内完成了几天的工作任务。
    斯大林斯克联合冶金工厂的马丁炉从三月一日到九日曾进行了一百多次的高速炼钢，仅在九日——斯大林安葬的日子——这一天，就进行了十六次。该厂工人、斯大林奖金得奖人索莫夫说：亲爱的斯大林不和我们在一起了。但他培养起来的伟大的党和他的战友，正满怀信心地把苏联人民引导到共产主义。我代表我们的生产小组，保证今年超过计划多生产一万吨金属，来响应党的号召。
