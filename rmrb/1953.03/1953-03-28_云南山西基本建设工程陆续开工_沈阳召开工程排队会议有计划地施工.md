The three major basic construction projects of the state-owned Yunnan Tin Corporation—a thermal power plant, a sixteen-kilometer aerial ropeway, and a beneficiation plant—have begun construction. Various construction materials are being continuously transported to the construction sites, and technical personnel and construction workers selected from various regions to participate in the construction have also been gradually assembling. To strengthen the leadership of the engineering construction, the Yunnan Tin Corporation has established basic construction, design, and geological departments, as well as an engineering company, and has transferred factory directors, mine managers, technical engineers, and other personnel from the production departments to strengthen the basic construction departments. Among them, the staff of the geological department has increased eightfold compared to the past.

Basic construction projects in Shanxi Province have commenced successively. Various basic construction departments are transferring large numbers of cadres to establish and improve administrative management and political work organizations at the construction sites. To strengthen site management and prepare conditions for the implementation of economic accounting systems, the site organizations of various basic construction units are implementing a district system and a dedicated responsibility system. The Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Company and the Taiyuan City Construction Engineering Company have established nine work districts, transferring 1,130 cadres to lead the work at the sites, and have trained a group of original site recorders. The Third Engineering Department of the Second Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government has established eight specialized groups under the work district director, including safety, materials, finance, quotas, statistics, tool management, and administration, so that all tasks are carried out under a dedicated responsibility system. To strengthen patriotic and labor discipline education among workers, the Third Engineering Department of the Second Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government has established political work offices in the work districts, and political instructors have been assigned to each construction site. In each work district, the Communist Party organization has also strengthened its leadership over the work of the trade union. The Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Company has assigned more than ten political work cadres to each work district and has formulated a draft political work plan. Local state-owned construction units in Shanxi Province have taken various measures to partially solve the serious problem of work stoppages currently existing in basic construction units. They have first started construction on projects that can be started earlier, such as the 15,000-square-meter cross-year project of the Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Company, which began construction before March 15th. The company originally planned to construct 70,000 square meters of projects, but only 10,000 square meters have been approved for construction, so they have begun to construct the projects that have already been approved. Before a large number of orders were finalized, the company's affiliated lumber factory used old and waste materials to manufacture daily-use furniture, putting more than 600 carpenters into production. Secondly, basic construction units have adopted methods of mutual support and reasonable adjustment of engineering tasks to put many unemployed workers into production. For example, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant lent a batch of bricks to units lacking bricks, enabling these units to start their projects earlier. The Taiyuan City Construction Engineering Company lent some of its workers to the municipal construction engineering company to carry out municipal construction that had already begun. The construction force of the Xin County Special District Engineering Team was weak, and the tasks were heavy. After reasonable adjustments, some of the tasks were handed over to the Datong City Construction Engineering Bureau, which had serious work stoppages, to undertake. In addition, some units that could not construct due to insufficient material preparation prepared to start earthwork projects and temporary construction projects at the site first.

To carry out construction in a planned way, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government's People's Economic Planning Commission recently convened an engineering scheduling conference to determine the first phase of construction projects to be started throughout the city from April to July. The principle of engineering scheduling is mainly to ensure the construction of key projects first. The first priority is heavy industry projects; the second is school buildings, dormitories, and warehouses for universities and specialized schools that cultivate national construction talents; and the third is office buildings, clubs, and other projects. Another principle of engineering scheduling is to determine the order of priority based on the preparation of design, materials, and equipment. According to these principles, various basic construction units conducted discussions, and finally, the Municipal People's Economic Planning Commission determined the first phase of construction projects for the entire city based on the specific situation. The total amount of engineering for the first phase accounts for 53 percent of the total engineering for the whole year. To effectively implement the policy of heavy industry first, the meeting also decided that although some key projects have not been included in the first phase of the construction plan due to insufficient preparation, all engineering units must step up preparations to ensure that these key projects can be started immediately when they meet the construction conditions.

    云南山西基本建设工程陆续开工
    沈阳召开工程排队会议有计划地施工
    国营云南锡业公司的三大基本建设工程——火电厂、长达十六公里的架空索道和选矿厂已开始兴建。各种建筑器材正源源运到工地，各地选拔参加建设的技术人员和建筑工人也已陆续集中。为了加强工程建设的领导，云南锡业公司已成立了基本建设、设计、地质三个处和一个工程公司，并从生产部门抽调厂长、矿长、技术工程人员等充实基本建设部门。其中地质处的工作人员比过去增加八倍。
    山西省基本建设工程已陆续开工。各基本建设部门正在抽调大批干部，建立和健全工地的行政管理和政治工作机构。为了加强工地管理，替实行经济核算制准备条件，各基本建设单位的工地组织，都实行了工区制和专责制。山西省建筑工程公司和太原市建筑工程公司已成立了九个工区，抽调了一千一百三十个干部领导工地工作，并已培养了一批工地原始纪录员。中央人民政府第二机械工业部第三工程处，在工区主任下面设立了安全、材料、财务、定额、统计、工具管理、行政等八个专门性的小组，使得各项工作都实行了专责制。为了加强对工人的爱国主义和劳动纪律教育，中央人民政府第二机械工业部第三工程处在工区建立了政治工作办公室，各工地设了政治指导员。在各工区，中共的组织也加强了对工会工作的领导。山西省建筑工程公司在每个工区配备了十个以上的政治工作干部，并制订了政治工作草案。山西省各地方国营建筑单位，采取各种办法，部分解决了目前基本建设单位严重存在的窝工问题。他们首先把能够提早开工的工程提早开工，如山西省建筑工程公司的一万五千平方公尺的跨年度工程，已在三月十五日以前开工。该公司有一批工程原计划是七万平方公尺，但目前已批准施工的只有一万平方公尺，于是就先开始建筑已经批准的工程。该公司所属木材厂在大批订货没有确定以前，就利用旧料，废料制造日用家具，使六百多名木工投入生产。其次，是各基本建设单位采取互相支援、合理调整工程任务的办法，使许多没有工作的工人投入了生产。如太原钢铁厂把一批存砖借给缺砖的单位，使这些单位的工程能提前开工。太原市建筑工程公司把一部分工人借给市政建设工程公司，进行已经开工的市政建设。忻县专区工程队的施工力量薄弱，任务很重，经过合理调整，就把一部分任务交给窝工严重的大同市建筑工程局承做。此外，有些材料准备不足不能施工的单位，准备先开始进行土方工程和工地临时建筑工程。
    为了有计划地施工，沈阳市人民政府人民经济计划委员会最近召开工程排队会议，确定了全市从四月份到七月份开工的第一期施工工程。工程排队的原则，主要是首先保证重点工程的建设。第一是重工业工程；其次是培养国家建设人材的大学和专科学校的校舍、宿舍和仓库等工程；再次是办公室、俱乐部等工程。工程排队的另一个原则是根据设计、材料设备的准备情况，来确定次序的先后。根据这样的原则，各基本建设单位都进行了讨论，最后由市人民经济计划委员会根据具体情况确定了全市第一期施工的工程，总计第一期施工的工程，占全年工程总量的百分之五十三。为了切实贯彻重工业第一的方针，会议并决定：目前有些重点工程虽因准备不足，未列入第一期施工计划之内，但各工程单位必须加紧准备，保证这些重点工程在具备了开工条件时，能够立即开工。　（新华社）
