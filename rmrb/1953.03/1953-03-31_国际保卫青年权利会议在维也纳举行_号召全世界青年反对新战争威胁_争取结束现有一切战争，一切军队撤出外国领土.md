Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 29th: The International Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights, which opened in Vienna on the 22nd, closed on the 27th. Representatives of youth from seventy-two countries unanimously adopted a resolution on defending the rights of youth and an open letter to the youth of the world, calling on the youth of the world to unite in the struggle to defend youth rights, strive for peace and national independence, and oppose new war threats.

    The conference proceeded in an atmosphere of unity and friendship among youth from various countries. During the sessions from the 22nd to the 27th, the representatives who spoke expressed their agreement with the conference's reports, believing that the activities of actively preparing for new wars and the expansion of armaments are the main reasons for the difficult lives of youth in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies. Representatives from the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democracies introduced the happy lives of youth in these countries; youth representatives from capitalist countries reported on the arduous lives of working youth in their respective countries and their resolute struggle to defend peace and youth rights; youth representatives from colonies and dependencies unanimously expressed in their speeches that they would unite more closely with the broad masses of people in their countries to strive for national independence. The speeches of youth representatives from Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, who are currently engaged in heroic national liberation struggles, were warmly welcomed. Representatives of youth from the United States, France, and Britain unanimously stated that they would work to end the unjust wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya. At the meeting on the 25th, after the speech by Vietnamese representative Wu Gang (transliteration), the French delegation lifted him high amidst enthusiastic cheers from the audience. Slogans of "Long live the youth of Vietnam and the youth of France" and "Oppose war" shook the venue. The British youth representatives also presented flowers to the Malay representative who spoke at that day's meeting and embraced him. The protests of the German youth representatives against the Bonn parliament's approval of the Bonn and Paris war treaties were met with sympathy and support from youth representatives from various countries.

    At the closing meeting, Italian representative Giuseppe Becchetti gave a report on the work of the "Subcommittee of the International Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights." He said: The conference organized five subcommittees. Based on broad and free discussions, the subcommittees worked according to the guidelines pointed out in the reports and the representatives' speeches, and determined the ways and methods for young people to struggle. Becchetti finally called on the youth of various countries to unite more closely in the struggle for a higher standard of living, to realize the rights of youth, and for world peace. French representative Pierre Bourdet then delivered a closing speech. He pointed out that in the struggle for a better future and for their rights, young people are fighting for peace first and foremost.

    The conference's resolution emphasized that the hardships of youth in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies are due to the capitalist governments' policies of preparing for new wars and the ensuing arms race. The resolution stated: The conference believes that youth should have the right to live a happy and peaceful life, and therefore demands guarantees of youth's right to employment; the right to universal free and democratic education; the right to be free from discrimination of any kind; the right to health care and recreation; the right to start a family; and the right to form youth organizations and freely discuss their needs. The resolution believes that these legitimate rights of youth can only be realized in peace and national independence of all countries, and specifically calls for ending all existing wars, stopping all preparations for launching a new world war, concluding a peace pact among the five great powers, abolishing and disbanding all treaties and groups aimed at launching a new world war, granting all countries the right to determine their own destiny, abolishing all foreign military bases established for aggressive purposes, stopping the arms race and the militarization of youth, stopping the use of culture, science, and art for war propaganda, drastically reducing war budgets and increasing appropriations to meet the urgent needs of the people, and restoring and developing international economic and cultural relations.

    The letter to the youth of the world calls on the young men and women of all countries and nations to strive to realize their legitimate and just demands, to oppose the threat of another world war, and to oppose any conspiracy to suppress the national independence demands of all peoples. Strive to end the wars currently underway and strive for the withdrawal of all troops from foreign territories. The letter to the youth of the world calls on young workers to demand equal pay for equal work, demand higher wages, oppose the system of increasing labor intensity, demand genuine opportunities to obtain employment, and strive for annual paid leave; calls on young farmers to demand land grants, reduced rents, demand state funding to improve rural conditions, and oppose the confiscation of land for the construction of military projects; calls on students to strive for increased education funding and strive for the democratization of the education system. The letter to the youth of the world calls on young men and women to demand the right to vote and be elected, oppose repression and persecution, and strive to establish their own organizations and publish newspapers that represent their interests.

    The letter to the youth of the world concludes by calling on the youth of all countries to unite and fight for their social and economic rights, for national independence, and against the threat of another war.
