    U.S. Directs French Aggressor Troops in Vietnam to Expand Puppet Army
    Hư Văn to Japan and South Korea to Receive Instructions
    According to Xinhua News Agency: Under the direction of the U.S. government, French Marshal Hư Văn, the "Army Commander of the Central European Region" of the North Atlantic Aggression Group, is undertaking a "trip to inspect the Far East battlefield." Hư Văn’s mission to the Far East is to conduct an on-the-ground study of France's possible role in the U.S.'s policy of expanding its war of aggression, particularly the expansion of the Bảo Đại puppet army, in order to implement the "using Asians to fight Asians" plan advocated by Eisenhower.
    The U.S. has long expressed dissatisfaction with the slow progress of France in expanding the Bảo Đại puppet army. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has recently repeatedly criticized France for "lacking initiative" and "not establishing a strong indigenous army in Indochina, as the U.S. did in South Korea." Dulles bluntly demanded that France allow the U.S. to train officers for the Bảo Đại puppet army as a condition for the U.S. to increase "aid" to the French aggressor troops in Vietnam. In order for France to "learn" from the U.S.'s "experience" in expanding the Rhee Syngman puppet army and to exchange opinions on expanding the war of aggression in the Far East, Clark extended an invitation to Hư Văn, requesting him to "travel" to South Korea.
    Hư Văn first arrived in Saigon on the 15th, then proceeded to Tokyo, where he began a series of meetings with the U.S. military command starting on the 19th. On the 22nd, Hư Văn flew from Japan to South Korea. Prior to this, the Associated Press had already revealed that "Hư Văn may be eager to take a close look at the South Korean army and wants to implement a similar plan in Indochina using the methods the U.S. used to build the South Korean army."
    [Xinhua News Agency, 28th] Under the urging of the U.S., the French aggressor authorities in Vietnam are stepping up the implementation of the "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese" plan. While French Military Inspector General Hư Văn was in the Far East carrying out activities to expand the Bảo Đại puppet army, the French aggressor authorities in Vietnam held a "Senior Military Committee" meeting with the Bảo Đại puppet clique in Đà Lạt on the 24th, deciding to expand the Bảo Đại puppet army by fifty-four battalions in 1953. Bảo Đại puppet clique Prime Minister Nguyễn Văn Tâm revealed after the meeting that in order to assemble these fifty-four battalions of puppet troops, Bảo Đại would intensify conscription and prepare to incorporate some religious units into the puppet army. They also plan to "study financial reforms" in order to intensify the extortion of the Vietnamese people to fund these puppet troops. Bảo Đại will bear 50 billion francs in military expenses in 1953, an increase of 20 billion francs compared to 1952.
    In order to facilitate the disguise of the puppet nature of the Bảo Đại puppet army, France has agreed to grant Bảo Đại more "rights" on the surface. France promised that the Bảo Đại puppet army headquarters would participate in combat plans, that all the new puppet troops to be established would be led by Bảo Đại puppet officers, and that it would "rapidly complete the plan for the Bảo Đại army to independently assume the responsibility of defending the country's security." However, the French military in Saigon quickly implied that the transfer of military command would be "gradual" and that the establishment of the new puppet army "would not affect the unified command of the Indochina war." The "aid" that the U.S. provides to Vietnam will still be controlled and distributed by France.
    While implementing the U.S.-demanded plan to collect cannon fodder, the French colonialists are very worried that the U.S. will seize control of Vietnam from France through "aid." The French bourgeois newspaper "Combat" recently commented on the "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese" plan, saying that "establishing units purely composed of Vietnamese" must resort to U.S. dollars and American equipment, "therefore, the control of the Indochina war seems to be transferring from Paris to Washington." The newspaper acknowledged that "the U.S. decision to prioritize the delivery of military supplies to Vietnam and train Vietnamese troops seems to be the worst form of internationalization."

### 美国指使侵越法军扩充伪军  许温到日本和南朝鲜去接受指示

    美国指使侵越法军扩充伪军
    许温到日本和南朝鲜去接受指示
    据新华社讯：在美国政府的指示下，法国元帅、北大西洋侵略集团“中欧区陆军司令”许温正在进行“视察远东战场”的“旅行”。许温远东之行的任务是：实地研究法国在美国扩大侵略战争政策中的可能作为，特别是扩充保大伪军，以实行艾森豪威尔所倡导的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划。
    美国对法国扩充保大伪军进展缓慢早已表示不满。美国国务卿杜勒斯最近更是一再斥责法国“缺乏主动性”，“没有像美国在南朝鲜所做的一样，在印度支那建立一支强大的土著军队”。杜勒斯直率地要求法国让美国来训练保大伪军军官，做为美国增加侵越法军“援助”的条件。为了使法国能够实地“学习”美国扩充李承晚伪军的“经验”和交换对于扩大远东侵略战争的意见，克拉克向许温发出了邀请，要求他到南朝鲜去“旅行”。
    许温在十五日首先到了西贡，接着到了东京，自十九日起开始与美军司令部举行一系列的会议，二十二日，许温从日本飞到南朝鲜。在此以前，合众社就已透露：“许温可能渴望仔细看一下南朝鲜的军队，想运用美国建立南朝鲜军的方法在印度支那进行类似的计划。”
    【新华社二十八日讯】侵越法军当局在美国的督促下，正在加紧实行“用越南人打越南人”的计划。在法国军事总监许温到远东进行扩充保大伪军活动的时候，法国侵越当局二十四日在大叻和保大傀儡集团举行了“高级军事委员会”会议，决定在一九五三年扩充保大伪军五十四个营。保大傀儡集团首相阮文心在会后透露，为了凑足这五十四个营伪军，保大将加紧抓丁，并准备设法将一些宗教部队并到伪军里去。他们还准备“研究财政的改革”，以便加紧搜括越南人民作为维持这些伪军的经费。保大在一九五三年将负担军费五百亿法郎，比一九五二年增加了二百亿法郎。
    为了便于掩饰保大伪军的傀儡性质，法国同意在表面上给予保大更多的“权利”。法国答应保大伪军总部参加作战计划，由保大伪军官全部领导那些准备建立的新伪军，并“迅速完成由保大军队单独担负保卫国土安全的计划”。但是，西贡法军方面很快就暗示：军事指挥权的移交将是“逐渐进行”的；新伪军的成立“也不影响印度支那战争的单一指挥”。美国给予越南的“援助”也依然由法国掌握分配。
    法国殖民者在实行美国要求的搜罗炮灰的计划时，十分担心美国会通过“援助”攫取法国对越南的控制权。法国资产阶级报纸“战斗报”最近在评论“用越南人打越南人”的计划时说：“成立纯粹由越南人组成的部队”，必须乞助于美元和美国装备，“因此，印度支那战争的控制权似乎将从巴黎转到华盛顿”。该报承认，“美国决定优先向越南输送军火并训练越南军队等事，似乎是最坏不过的国际化。”
