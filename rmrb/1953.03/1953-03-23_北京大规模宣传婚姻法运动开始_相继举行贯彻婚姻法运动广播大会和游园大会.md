Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Beijing—A large-scale campaign to publicize the Marriage Law has begun in Beijing.

Starting from February 26th, Beijing began training cadres. More than 25,000 cadres, reporters, propagandists, and activists directly participating in the implementation of the Marriage Law throughout the city have undergone or are undergoing thorough training. Through listening to reports, reading documents, and participating in group discussions, cadres and activists participating in the training have generally clarified the boundaries between the old and new marriage systems, clarified the guidelines, policies, and methods of the movement, and reversed the impetuous mood they had before participating in the study. Simultaneously with the training of cadres, all districts have successively conducted inspections on the implementation of the Marriage Law. In terms of propaganda materials, the Beijing Municipal Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law has also made full preparations, having compiled, reprinted, and purchased a total of twenty types of propaganda materials, amounting to 258,500 copies, which have been distributed to cadres, propagandists, propaganda teams, resident activists, cultural centers, and mass theatrical troupes. Personnel from the Beijing People's Fine Arts Studio painted many propaganda posters and placards related to the implementation of the Marriage Law during the key pilot period, and are now rushing to print them, preparing to distribute them to various streets, rural areas, and factories for widespread posting. Various professional and amateur theatrical troupes in Beijing are stepping up rehearsals of programs related to the Marriage Law, some of which have already begun to be staged; in addition, twenty film projection teams are preparing to tour the suburbs.

The Beijing Municipal Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law held a broadcast rally for the implementation of the Marriage Law on the afternoon of the 21st, with more than 150,000 people organized throughout the city to listen to the broadcast. At the broadcast rally, Zhang Youyu, Director of the Beijing Municipal Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law and Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, announced the official start of the large-scale campaign to publicize the Marriage Law throughout the city. This was followed by a speech by Zhang Xiaomei, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law and Chairman of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, who briefly explained the basic spirit of the Marriage Law. Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Zhang Dazhong, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, spoke successively, calling on workers and youth throughout the city to actively participate in the publicity work of the Marriage Law implementation campaign. Subsequently, typical reports were made by Zhang Guanghai and Xu Jingyuan, workers from the Beijing Clothing Factory; Wang Tang, a farmer from Heita Village in Haidian District, Western Suburbs; Yang Shuqin, a model military dependent of the Chinese People's Volunteers; and Rong Fugang, a cadre from the Central Academy of Drama's affiliated song and dance troupe. Some reported on their experiences in striving for marital autonomy, while others introduced their experiences in transforming old-fashioned families and establishing new, harmonious families. The speeches and typical reports at the broadcast rally provided the audience with profound education.

Beijing held a grand "Publicity and Implementation of the Marriage Law Garden Party" on the 22nd. More than 100,000 people participated in the garden party. In the spacious Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, the crowds of people participating in the garden party were packed from morning till night. Through the careful arrangements of the Beijing Municipal Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the entire garden party was transformed into a very vivid place for publicizing the Marriage Law. Here, there were open-air picture exhibitions explaining the Marriage Law, temporary theaters using folk arts to perform the Marriage Law, temporary library reading stations filled with books and periodicals related to marriage issues, temporary book supply stations selling Marriage Law books, newspapers, and pictures, and Marriage Law Q&A stations specifically for answering questions from the masses attending the garden party. In addition, the conference also screened films such as "Zhao Xiaolan" and "A Parent's Affair" for the masses attending the garden party. The garden party was full of joyful atmosphere. Loudspeakers broadcast various group dances from morning till night. There was a long line at the open-air picture exhibition. The masses attending the garden party were looking at the illustrated guide to the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China in an orderly manner. Many of these people came on behalf of trade union groups or neighbors, and they were watching carefully, without missing a single one, so that they could convey it to everyone when they returned. At the temporary library reading station, rows of small benches were filled with people. All men, women, old, and young were gathered here, engrossed in reading various books and periodicals related to the Marriage Law. Not far away was the Marriage Law Q&A station, where staff from the Beijing Municipal Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law were busy answering various difficult questions raised by people regarding the implementation of the Marriage Law. In order to further improve their understanding of the Marriage Law, many people attending the garden party went to the temporary book supply station in the venue to purchase books related to the Marriage Law.
