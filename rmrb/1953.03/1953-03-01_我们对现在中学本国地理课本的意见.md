Our Opinions on the Current Middle School National Geography Textbooks

Editor's Note: In mid-January, the editorial department of this newspaper invited geography teachers from several middle schools in Beijing to hold a symposium. The attendees included geography teachers from Beijing No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 8 Middle Schools, No. 4, No. 6 Girls' Middle Schools, and the Affiliated Middle School of Beijing Normal University. At the meeting, the teachers raised many opinions on the current middle school national geography textbooks. This article is based on the opinions discussed by the teachers who participated in the symposium.

The purpose of national geography teaching is, on the one hand, to provide students with systematic knowledge about the geography of the motherland, and on the other hand, to fully conduct political and ideological education for students through teaching activities, and to improve students' political level. To achieve this goal, it certainly depends on the improvement of teachers' political and professional level and the reform of teaching methods, and a relatively good geography textbook is also very necessary. However, the current national geography textbooks used in middle schools across the country cannot meet this requirement. Whether in terms of content or form, it has great shortcomings.

Since liberation, the People's Education Publishing House has published two types of middle school national geography textbooks: one is the junior high school national geography textbook, and the other is the senior high school national geography textbook. The junior high school national geography textbook is divided into four volumes: the first and second volumes were written by Zeng Ciliang. The author uses cities as the backbone and describes them point by point, which is originally acceptable; however, the lack of due explanation of the geographical characteristics of the region is a major shortcoming, because this cannot enable students to obtain systematic geographical knowledge. The third and fourth volumes were changed to a set of old textbooks originally published by Kaiming Bookstore and edited by Tian Shiying (hereinafter referred to as the Tian edition) [Note 1], with only slight modifications in content and wording. These textbooks basically retain the flavor of "geographical stereotyped writing", and the book follows a set of formulas such as "topography, climate, industry, transportation, and cities", listing a large number of place names and numbers. In this way, although the junior high school national geography textbook is marked on the cover as a set of four consecutive volumes, it is two completely different sets in terms of content and style.

As for the senior high school national geography textbook, only the first volume of the senior high school national geography textbook jointly compiled by Tian Shiying and Deng Qidong (hereinafter referred to as the Tian-Deng edition) [Note 2] was published in December 1950. The content is the general theory of China's physical geography. What the second volume is, has never been heard of. This has affected the teaching work of senior high school national geography, causing great difficulties for many teachers in the teaching of this course. Is the Tian-Deng edition a completely new textbook? The facts show that it is not: judging from the content of the teaching material, most of it is extracted from the first lecture of the first part of the upper volume "Department of Nature" of the national geography textbook compiled by Deng Qidong before liberation (published by Zhengzhong Bookstore), with only slight additions and modifications.

Our middle school geography textbooks not only maintain the old set in terms of style, but also have not escaped the old set in terms of content. For example, from the perspective of geography, the textbooks still retain the anti-scientific viewpoint of bourgeois environmental determinism. For example, when talking about the causes of flooding of the Yellow River, Huai River and other rivers, the editors said: "Several major rivers in our country, such as the Yangtze River, Huai River, Yellow River, Hai River and Liao River, are mostly prone to flooding due to siltation in the lower reaches and inconvenient drainage. The rulers of past dynasties only knew how to passively build dikes for defense, ignoring the fundamental method of dredging, so after thousands of years of river management, floods remain the same." Obviously, the editors here directly push the responsibility for the floods to the rivers; while the responsibility of the reactionary rulers is only to ignore the "fundamental method of dredging". If we follow this logic, then the victories of the Huai River management, the Jingjiang flood diversion, and the overflow weir projects in New China are only due to the attention to the "method of dredging", rather than due to our superior social system and the correct leadership of the Party. Why is the land and water transportation in Guizhou Province inconvenient? The editors said that it is restricted by "topography" (the above is from the Tian edition). We want to ask: Why are there newly built highways on the Kangzang Plateau, thousands of meters above sea level, in today's liberated China? Does "topographic restriction" not exist now? As for the reasons why agriculture is not developed in Qaidam, Tarim, Junggar and other basins, the editors said that it is "remotely located inland, with scarce rainfall and unfavorable climate" (Tian edition). This statement is one-sided. Natural causes will certainly affect the development of agriculture, but this influence is not decisive. The experience of the patriotic production increase movement proves that after the feudal land relations are eliminated and the peasants obtain land, they can use intensive cultivation, appropriate fertilization and other methods to improve the growth conditions of crops, in order to increase the yield per unit area and expand the planting range of crops.

In terms of politics, there are also many shortcomings in the textbooks. For example, when talking about Jinggang Mountain and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the editors wrote: "However, Jinggang Mountain in the area bordering Hunan and Jiangxi became the first revolutionary base..." "The natural environment of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is far inferior to the Guanzhong Plain, but it has become the base that nurtured the people's regime." (Tian-Deng edition) This makes students feel that it seems accidental that Jinggang Mountain and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region can become the source of revolution. The editors completely ignored the reasons for the occurrence and existence of the Chinese red regime. On this point, Chairman Mao said very clearly: "First,... we only need to know that the division and war of the Chinese white regime are continuous, then the emergence, existence and increasing development of the red regime is undoubtedly. Second, the places where the Chinese red regime first occurred and can exist for a long time are not those places that have not been affected by the democratic revolution, such as Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan and the northern provinces, but in the process of the bourgeois democratic revolution in 1926 and 1927, the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers greatly rose up, such as Hunan, Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces. ...Third, whether the local people's regime can exist for a long time depends on whether the national revolutionary situation is moving forward. ...Fourth, the existence of a considerable force of formal Red Army is a necessary condition for the existence of the red regime. ...Fifth... there must also be an important condition, that is, the Communist Party organization is powerful and its policy is not wrong." ("Why Can the Chinese Red Regime Exist?") The editors of the textbook made the following explanation about the importance of Taiwan and Hainan Island: "From Taiwan, we can go east to the Pacific Ocean, and from Hainan Island, we can go south to Southeast Asia... We must maintain and utilize these two islands well, otherwise we cannot deal with the imperialists in the Pacific Ocean" (Tian-Deng edition). The editors forgot one fact: Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandits and American imperialists are still occupying our Taiwan. We must liberate it from the hands of the enemy. The reason why we want to "maintain and utilize" these two islands cannot be explained by the word "deal with". This kind of ambiguous word can only cause misconceptions in the minds of students. In addition, the editors' attitude towards national issues is not serious enough. For example, when the editors talked about the Miao ethnic group in Guizhou Province, they said: "Among them, there are more than 30 kinds of Bai Miao, Hua Miao, Hei Miao...etc." We believe that it is inappropriate to call the Miao ethnic group "Bai Miao, Hua Miao, Hei Miao", which is obviously a derogatory term for ethnic minorities. When mentioning the industry of Guizhou, it is said: "The rice fields on both sides of the river valleys and mountain slopes are mostly cultivated by Han people, and the mountain slopes are mostly planted with miscellaneous grains by Miao people."
(The above is from the Tian edition) The editors here neither explained the reasons for this phenomenon, nor did they explain what changes have taken place and what changes will take place. Why did the northern plateau of China fail to prosper in the past? The editors believed that it was "due to the control of feudal forces and the obstacles of mutual discrimination among ethnic groups" (Tian-Deng edition). Here, the editors did not explain who the representatives of the feudal forces were, thus lightly letting go of the Kuomintang reactionaries' heinous rule of "Han chauvinism" and their oppression of ethnic minorities. The editors forgot that the Kuomintang reactionaries' heinous rule was the root cause of "mutual discrimination among ethnic groups."

One of the reasons why middle school geography textbooks are boring is that the editors listed a large number of names and numbers in the text. For example, when talking about the location of Xi'an City, it listed the names of unnecessary small rivers such as Ba River, Feng River, Chan River, and Zao River that flow through the suburbs of Xi'an. When describing the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area, the names of all fourteen counties in the area were also written out. When writing about the Suiyuan Houtao Irrigation Canal, the names of eight canals, such as Yongji, Tongji, and Fengji, were listed one by one in the text. When mentioning the Huai River management project, the editors not only introduced the three reservoirs of "Baisha, Banqiao (the original book mistakenly wrote 'Baisha Banqiao'), and Shimantan", but also listed the names of seven flood storage depressions such as Laowangpo, Jiaoting Lake, and Tong Lake. Regarding the national railway, the editors tediously listed the names of more than 40 railway lines. When introducing the valleys along the river in Sichuan Province, it listed seven valley names that even the people of Sichuan did not pay much attention to. When introducing the minerals of Guizhou Province, it listed nine kinds of minerals and nineteen place names at once: "Copper mines are distributed in Dading, Weining, Bijie, Shuicheng and other counties, with large reserves. Mercury is the most noteworthy mineral resource in the province, and the mining area is distributed in an arc shape from southeast to southwest. Shengxi, Danzhai, and Sandu are important mercury producing areas in our country. In addition, Sandu, Dujiang, and Rongjiang produce antimony, Weining and Shuicheng produce silver, lead, and zinc, Tianzhu and Jinping produce gold, Zhenfeng and Zunyi produce saltpeter, and Bijie, Longli, and Yuqing produce sulfur." The handling of numbers is also not appropriate enough. Here, let's take an example. When talking about the climate of Jiangxi Province, the editors listed many numbers in a short paragraph: "The province is located in the south, with the southern end reaching 24 degrees 23 minutes north latitude,... the average temperature in July reaches over 29 degrees Celsius,... the summer temperature in Guling, Lushan is often around 23 degrees Celsius, only 16 degrees in the morning and evening. ...The average temperature in January in the province is between 6 degrees and 10 degrees Celsius,... the annual rainfall is between 1,000 mm and 1,500 mm, decreasing from south to north. ...The annual rainfall in Jiujiang is only 1,400 mm, and Guling has about 2,000 mm." This paragraph is almost piled up with numbers. It is very difficult for children to memorize, no wonder the students always shout when they are in geography class: "I can't remember the place names, what should I do?"

Finally, we would also like to offer some opinions on the wording of the textbooks. The wording of middle school geography textbooks should be simple and vivid, so that students like their textbooks as much as they like a good novel. But how is the wording of the national geography textbooks we are currently using? Let's open the textbooks and take a look. They are filled with phrases such as "ditches and canals are crisscrossed, and the fields can be seen from each other", "the general trend of mountains and rivers", "the basin is surrounded by high mountains", "the mountains are steep and towering", "the canals are vertical and horizontal, and the green fields are vast", "inheriting the custom", "agricultural production is prosperous, and the people are prosperous", and also used many phrases such as "dig deep, build low weirs, cut corners when encountering bends, and extract the heart when encountering the right." "...tropical cyclones... mostly follow a parabolic path." "Combining storage and discharge, comprehensively considering the upper, middle and lower reaches; focusing on flood control, combined with irrigation and navigation." (The above is from the Tian edition) etc.

May I ask: How can children understand such difficult words and sentences?

The above are just our preliminary opinions on middle school geography textbooks, and we are now putting them forward for reference by the editors of geography textbooks.

[Note 1] The fourth volume of the middle school geography textbook compiled by Tian Shiying (for second grade students) is said to have been slightly revised, but some schools have not yet seen it. We have conducted a preliminary inspection of this newly revised version and found that there is basically no change in content, only the number of pages in the textbook has changed.

[Note 2] The upper volume of the senior high school national geography textbook compiled by Tian Shiying and Deng Qidong, published by the People's Education Publishing House, has been discontinued since the autumn of 1952. However, there is no newly compiled textbook now, and some schools are still uncritically adopting this Tian-Deng edition as a textbook; moreover, the views in this book have also had a great impact on teachers and students in the past, so it is still necessary to criticize the shortcomings in this book.

    我们对现在中学本国地理课本的意见
    褚亚平　张景华　李祖伟　周额青  张　荦　伊佩衡　罗峻岩集体讨论  褚亚平执笔
    编者按：一月中旬本报编辑部曾邀请北京若干中学的地理教师举行了一次座谈会。出席的有北京市第二、第三、第四、第八中学，第四、第六女子中学和北京师范大学附属中学的地理教师。会上，教师们对现在的中学本国地理课本提出了很多意见。本文就是由参加座谈会的教师们在会上讨论的意见。
    本国地理教学的目的，一方面是给同学以关于祖国地理的系统知识，另一方面是通过教学活动充分地对同学进行政治思想教育，提高同学的政治水平。要达到这个目的，固然有赖于教师政治和业务水平的提高以及教学方法的改革，而一套比较好的地理课本也是很必要的。然而，现在全国中学所用的本国地理课本是不能满足这个要求的，不论在内容方面或者在形式方面，它都有着很大的缺点。
    解放以后，人民教育出版社出版了两种中学本国地理课本：一种是初中本国地理课本，一种是高中本国地理课本。初中本国地理课本分为四册：第一、第二两册是曾次亮编写的。作者以都市为骨干，逐点描述，这本来是可以的；但对区域的地理特点没有作应有的说明，就是很大的缺点了，因为这不能使同学获得系统的地理知识。第三、第四两册则改用原由开明书店出版、田世英编的一套旧课本（以下简称田编本）〔注一〕，只是在内容、文字方面稍稍作了修改。这些课本基本上还保留着“地理八股”的气味，书内沿用了“地形、气候、产业、交通、都市”等一套公式，罗列了一大堆的地名和数字。这样，初中本国地理课本，虽然在书皮上标明是四册一套相连续的课本，而在内容体例上却是截然不同的两套。
    至于高中本国地理课本，仅在一九五○年十二月出版了田世英和邓启东合编的高中本国地理课本上册（以下简称田邓本）〔注二〕，内容是中国自然地理总论部分，下册是什么，始终没有下文。这就影响了高中本国地理的教学工作，使许多教师在这门课程的教学上遭到很大的困难。田邓本是不是一本完全新的课本呢？事实说明不是的：从教材内容来看，大部分是由解放前邓启东所编的本国地理教科书（正中书局出版）上册第一编第一讲“自然之部”中摘下来的，只是稍稍加以补充和修改而已。
    我们的中学地理课本不仅在体例上保持着旧的一套，在内容方面也没有摆脱旧的一套。例如从地理学方面来看，课本中还保留着资产阶级自然环境决定论的反科学观点。例如在谈到黄河、淮河等河流泛滥成灾的原因时，编者说：“我国主要的几条大河，像长江、淮河、黄河、海河和辽河等，大都因为下游淤塞，排水不便，常常泛滥成灾。历代治河只知消极的筑堤防御，忽略了根本的疏导方法，所以治河治了几千年，水灾依然如故。”显然，编者在这里把水灾的责任直接推到河流身上去了；而反动统治者的责任，只是忽略了“根本的疏导方法”。如果按这种逻辑来推论，那末，新中国治淮、荆江分洪、溢洪堰等工程的胜利，仅仅是由于注意了“疏导方法”，而不是由于我们的优越的社会制度和党的正确领导了。贵州省的水陆交通为什么不方便呢？编者说是受了“地形限制”（以上均见田编本）。我们要问：为什么在解放后的今日，拔海数千公尺的康藏高原上会出现新筑的公路呢？难道现在“地形限制”就不存在了吗？至于柴达木、塔里木、准噶尔等盆地农业不发展的原因，编者说是“僻居内陆，雨量稀少，气候不良”（田编本），这种说法是带有片面性的。自然原因固然会影响农业的发展，但这种影响并不是决定性的。爱国丰产运动的经验证明，在封建的土地关系消灭后，农民获得了土地，可以用精耕细作、适当施肥等等方法来改善农作物的生长条件，以提高单位面积的产量，并扩展农作物的种植范围。
    在政治方面，课本中的缺点也是不少的。例如，在讲到井冈山和陕北高原时，编者写道：“但是在湖南和江西交界一带的井冈山，却成了第一个革命的根据地……”“陕北高原的自然环境远不如泾渭平原，但是它却成了孕育人民政权的根据地。”（田邓本）这使同学们觉得，井冈山和陕北之所以能够成为革命策源地，似乎是偶然的。编者完全忽略了中国红色政权发生和存在的原因。关于这一点，毛主席说得很清楚：“第一，……我们只须知道中国白色政权的分裂和战争是继续不断的，则红色政权的发生、存在并且日益发展，便是无疑的了。第二，中国红色政权首先发生和能够长期地存在的地方，不是那种并未经过民主革命影响的地方，例如四川、贵州、云南及北方各省，而是在一九二六和一九二七两年资产阶级民主革命过程中工农兵士群众曾经大大地起来过的地方，例如湖南、广东、湖北、江西等省。……第三，小地方民众政权之能否长期地存在，则决定于全国革命形势是否向前发展这一个条件。……第四，相当力量的正式红军的存在，是红色政权存在的必要条件。……第五……还须有一个要紧的条件，就是共产党组织的有力量和它的政策的不错误。”（“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”）课本的编者对于台湾和海南岛的重要性，作了如下的解释：“由台湾可以东出太平洋，由海南岛可以南下南洋……我们必须好好保持并利用这两个岛屿，否则就不能同帝国主义者在太平洋上周旋”（田邓本）编者忘记了这样一件事实：蒋介石残余匪帮和美帝国主义者还占领着我们的台湾。我们一定要把它从敌人的手里解放出来。我们之所以要“保持并利用”这两个岛屿，是不能用“周旋”两个字来解释的，这种意义含糊的字眼只能使同学们在思想上造成错觉。此外，对待民族问题，编者的态度也是不够严肃的。例如，编者在讲到贵州省的苗族时，说：“其中有白苗、花苗、黑苗……等三十多种。”我们认为，以“白苗、花苗、黑苗”来称呼苗族是不妥当的，这显然是蔑视少数民族的说法。提到贵州的产业时，又说：“河谷两岸和山坡梯田多由汉人耕种稻米，山坡上多由苗人种植杂粮。”
    （以上均见田编本）编者在这里既没有说明产生这种现象的原因，也没有说明那里的情况究竟有了什么变化和将要起什么变化。中国北部高原过去为什么未能繁荣呢？编者认为是“由于封建势力的把持，民族间相互歧视的阻碍”（田邓本）。这里，编者没有说明封建势力的代表者是谁，从而把国民党反动派“大汉族主义”的罪恶统治及其对少数民族的压迫，轻轻地放过去了。编者忘记了，国民党反动派的罪恶统治，正是“民族间相互歧视”的根本原因。
    中学地理课本的所以枯燥无味，原因之一是编者在文中罗列了一大堆的名字、数字。例如在讲到西安市的位置时，竟列出了流贯西安郊区的灞水、沣水、滻水、皂河等不必要的小河名称。在叙述都江堰灌溉区时，把全区十四个县的县名也都写了出来。写绥远后套灌溉渠时，把永济、通济、丰济等八个渠名一一列入了课文。提到治淮工程时，编者不仅介绍了“白沙、板桥（原书误写为‘白沙板桥’）、石漫滩”三个水库，并罗列了老王坡、蛟停湖、潼湖等七个蓄洪洼地的名称。关于全国的铁路，编者竟烦琐地列出了四十多条铁路线的名称。而在介绍四川省沿江的峡谷时，竟列出了连四川老百姓也不太注意的七个峡名。介绍贵州省的矿产时，一下子列了九种矿物，十九个地名：“铜矿分布在大定、威宁、毕节、水城等县，储量很大。汞是本省最可注意的矿源，矿区从东南向西南成弧状分布。省溪、丹寨、三都是我国汞的重要产区。此外三都、都江、榕江产锑，威宁、水城产银、铅、锌，天柱、锦屏产金，贞丰、遵义产硝，毕节、龙里、余庆产硫磺。”在数字的处理上，同样是不够妥当的，这里我们举一个例子来说吧，在谈到江西省气候时，编者在短短的一段文字中就列了很多个数字：“本省位置偏南，南端达北纬二十四度二十三分，……七月平均气温达摄氏二十九度以上，……庐山牯岭夏季气温常在摄氏二十三度左右，早晚只有十六度。……一月平均气温全省在摄氏六度到十度之间，……全年雨量在一千公厘到一千五百公厘之间，从南向北递减。……九江年雨量只有一千四百公厘，牯岭就有二千公厘光景。”这一段文字几乎是用数字堆砌起来的，要让孩子们去记忆，那是很困难的，无怪乎同学们在上地理课时总是嚷着：“地名记不住，怎么办？”
    最后，我们在课本的文字方面也提出一点意见。中学地理课本的文字应该是浅显生动的，使学生喜爱他的课本，如同爱好一本好的小说一样。但是现在我们用的本国地理课本在文字的处理上是怎样的呢？我们翻开课本来看一看吧，里边充满着“沟渠交错，田畴相望”、“山河大势”、“盆地崇山四围”、“山地峰峦峻拔”、“川渠纵横，绿野弥望”、“相袭成风”、“农作繁兴、人民殷富”之类的语句，还套用了许多什么“深淘滩，低作堰，遇湾截角，逢正抽心。”“……热带气旋，……大都循着抛物线的途径进行。”“蓄泄兼施，上中下游统筹兼顾；防洪为主，结合灌溉航运。”（以上均见田编本）等等的字句。
    试问：孩子们怎能理解这么难懂的字句呢？
    以上只是我们对中学地理课本的初步意见，现在提出来以供地理课本编者们参考。
    〔注一〕田世英编写的中学地理课本第四册（二年级用），据说已略加修改，但目前若干学校尚未看到。我们曾对这一新修订本进行了初步检查，发现在内容方面基本上没有变动，只是课本页数有了改变。
    〔注二〕人民教育出版社出版、田世英、邓启东编写的高中本国地理课本上册，已从一九五二年秋季起停止使用。但是现在还没有新编的课本，有的学校现在还无批判地采用这田邓本作教本；而且，这本书的观点在过去也曾给予教师和学生以很大影响，所以这本书里面的缺点仍然有提出批评的必要。
