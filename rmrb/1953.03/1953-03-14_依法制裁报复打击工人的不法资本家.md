    Resolutely Punish Unlawful Capitalists Who Retaliate Against and Crack Down on Workers According to Law

    After the great "Five-Anti" Movement, some unlawful capitalists in Suzhou, Wuhu, Jinan and other places have taken various measures to retaliate against workers and shop assistants, seriously infringing upon the lives, occupations, and various legal interests of workers. This situation should arouse the attention of local Party and government organs and trade unions.

    After the "Five-Anti" Movement, most capitalists received a profound education, corrected their business attitudes, and united with the broad masses of workers and staff to work hard for "developing production and prospering the economy" under the leadership of the state-owned economy. However, there are also a few capitalists who have not abandoned their wrongdoings. On the one hand, they continue to apply their "five poisons," and on the other hand, they retaliate against the worker activists in the "Five-Anti" Movement. This phenomenon is absolutely intolerable and must be resolutely stopped.

    The People's Procuratorates of Suzhou, Wuhu, and Jinan have taken the initiative to report these cases and have dealt with them seriously and promptly, which is entirely correct. The local people's judicial organs should follow the example of the People's Procuratorates of Suzhou, Wuhu, and Jinan, rely on the broad masses of workers and staff, take the initiative to understand and expose the illegal facts of unlawful capitalists, closely cooperate with relevant departments, punish the criminal acts of those unlawful capitalists according to law, and pay attention to expanding the influence and effect, so as to educate other capitalists to abide by the law. Trade union organizations at all levels have the responsibility to protect the interests of workers and staff, supervise the capitalists to earnestly implement government decrees, oppose their violation of government decrees and acts that hinder production, and wage a resolute struggle against those who continue to infringe upon national interests, retaliate against the working class, infringe upon the legitimate interests of workers and staff, and sabotage production after the "Five-Anti" Movement, so as to ensure the victorious results of the "Five-Anti" Movement and the legitimate interests of the working class.

    依法制裁报复打击工人的不法资本家
    在伟大的“五反”运动之后，苏州、芜湖、济南等地部分不法资本家，采取各种手段向工人店员进行打击报复，使工人的生命、职业及各种合法利益受到严重侵害。这一情况应引起各地党政机关和工会的重视。
    经过“五反”运动，多数资本家受到了深刻的教育，端正了经营态度，和广大职工团结一道，在国营经济领导之下，为“发展生产，繁荣经济”而努力。但是，也还有少数资本家并没有放弃其错误行为。他们一方面继续施其“五毒”，另一方面对“五反”运动中的工人积极分子进行打击报复，这种现象是绝对不能容忍的，必须坚决制止。
    苏州、芜湖、济南三市的人民检察署对这些案件主动地加以检举，并及时予以严肃处理，是完全正确的。各地人民司法机关，都应效法苏州、芜湖、济南三市的人民检察署，依靠广大职工群众，主动地了解和揭发不法资本家的违法事实，与有关部门密切配合，依法制裁那些不法资本家的犯罪行为，并注意扩大影响和效果，借以对其他资本家进行守法的教育。各地工会组织有责任保护工人、职员群众的利益，监督资方切实执行政府法令，反对其违背政府法令和妨碍生产的行为，对那些在“五反”运动之后继续侵害国家利益，向工人阶级进行报复、侵犯职工合法利益及破坏生产的行为，应进行坚决的斗争，以确保“五反”运动的胜利成果和工人阶级的合法利益。
