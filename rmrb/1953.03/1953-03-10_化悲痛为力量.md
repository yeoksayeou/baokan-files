    Turning Grief into Strength
    Our Hunan Reporter Station
    The heart of Comrade Stalin, the leader and teacher of the working people of the whole world, has stopped beating. The unfortunate news has arrived, and the grief of the working class in Hunan Province cannot be described in words.
    The heavy, sorrowful sound of the whistle lingered in the sky over Hunan. Miners, railway workers, and electrical workers, wearing black纱, silently held a mourning ceremony in front of Comrade Stalin's portrait. Their hearts bear deep, irremovable grief; but they immediately understood that they must transform grief into strength with the same spirit that Comrade Stalin once swore to Comrade Lenin, and solemnly swear to Comrade Stalin.
    On the evening of March 6, when the bad news of Comrade Stalin's death reached the Changsha Automobile Parts Factory, the workers had already left work. They immediately ran from the stadiums and dormitories to the office of Zhu Yunhua, the secretary of the factory's Party branch, to inquire about Comrade Stalin's condition.
    "Our beloved Comrade Stalin has passed away!" The branch secretary replied to everyone painfully.
    The workers immediately lowered their heads, everyone's eyes fixed on the floor, their throats choked, and no one could say another word.
    "Comrades, we are grieved, we are saddened, but we can only work harder to realize Comrade Stalin's遗训," the branch secretary said, suppressing his own feelings.
    Old driller Wang Ruiqing had just returned from a walk on the street and suddenly felt that the factory was as silent as death. He saw tears on the face of young worker Peng Shaohua. Wang Ruiqing already felt that something unfortunate had happened.
    "What's wrong?" he asked.
    "Comrade Stalin has passed away!"
    This was a heavy blow, too heavy, so that Wang Ruiqing couldn't even cry. He lowered his head and rushed out of the factory gate. "Stalin, dear Stalin!" Thinking about it, his tears flowed down. He passed by the home of Teacher Li, where he often went to sit for a while. As soon as he entered the door, Teacher Li's wife saw that he was not in good spirits and asked him: "Teacher Wang, what's wrong?" He told the unfortunate news to Elder Sister Li. The old couple, Elder Sister Li and Teacher Li, had lived a comfortable life after liberation, and they often thought about Chairman Mao and Stalin. The old woman lamented and said:
        "A good person like Stalin should live to be one hundred and fifty years old!"
        "Isn't that right? He should live to be two hundred years old!"
    Teacher Wang and Elder Sister Li were speechless and sat in silence for a while.
    At nine o'clock in the evening, Teacher Wang returned to the dormitory, which was a newly built workers' dormitory. He entered his room, fell on the bed, and covered himself with the quilt, thinking sadly about many things. This day was his night shift, but he couldn't sleep. He thought about the liberation of the working class; about Comrade Bukov, the Soviet expert who braved the wind and rain during the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project; about the construction of the great motherland; and about Chairman Mao and Stalin... In this way, the old worker Wang Ruiqing spent his sad hours.
    Suddenly, his young apprentice闯进门来.
    "Teacher Wang, the machine is broken."
    Wang Ruiqing sat up from the bed, put on his shoes, and ran to the factory.
    A grinder stopped turning. This is the second production process for manufacturing automobile piston rings, and other machines are waiting for the grinder to turn. That night, Teacher Wang worked nervously beside the grinder, as if Stalin was watching him repair the machine. He worked from twelve o'clock that night until five o'clock the next afternoon. He said: "No, I can't rest. To mourn Stalin, I will complete the task." Until the machine was restored to operation.
    On the morning of March 8, more than 100 employees of the factory gathered in the factory auditorium to hold a memorial service. The Internationale震荡着 every worker's heart. The secretary of the Party branch said at the memorial service: "To commemorate the death of Comrade Stalin, we must guarantee the overfulfillment of the production task." This is an oath to Comrade Stalin. After the factory promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, there has been a significant improvement in production. High-speed cutting method increased the lathe from 300 revolutions per minute to 1,000 revolutions per minute, and multi-blade multi-cutter increased the machine from one cutter to eight cutters. After the memorial service, all the workers of the factory decided to turn grief into strength. Every worker and every production team launched a discussion on the March production plan. They want to strive to increase the product by one time compared with February.
    This is a solemn oath to Comrade Stalin. Young worker Zhu Zhenguo said: "Comrade Stalin has passed away, but the spirit of Comrade Stalin is still alive, and we will never forget Stalin. He worked hard for the benefit of our working people all his life. I will firmly remember Stalin. As long as I think of Stalin, I will have the courage to overcome all difficulties."
    Old driller Wang Ruiqing guaranteed to Comrade Stalin: "We guarantee to supply the tools to all production teams in the factory in a timely manner, and at the same time repair the machines, eliminate faults, support the production teams, and complete the March production task!" He said: "I will intensify my work, study hard, improve my consciousness, and strive to join the Communist Party of China."
    At four o'clock in the afternoon of March 8, Wang Ruiqing participated in the Party class learning organized by the Communist Party branch.
    All the workers in the factory seemed to be saying in unison: Dear Comrade Stalin, we swear to you that we will definitely work hard to increase production, strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, build our own motherland, and unite with the Soviet big brother to combat aggressors and defend world peace.

    化悲痛为力量
    本报湖南记者站
    全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师斯大林同志的心脏停止了跳动。不幸的消息传来，湖南省的工人阶级的悲痛是不能够用言语来形容的。
    沉重的悲切的汽笛声萦绕在湖南的上空，矿工、铁路工人、电机工人，带上黑纱，默默地在斯大林同志的遗像前举行哀悼。他们的心里承受着深沉的不能移去的悲痛；但是他们立即懂得要用斯大林同志曾经向列宁同志宣誓的同样精神，化悲痛为力量，向斯大林同志庄严宣誓。
    三月六日黄昏，斯大林同志逝世的恶耗传到长沙汽车配件厂的时候，工人们都已下班了，他们立刻从球场上、从宿舍里纷纷跑向工厂党支部书记朱韵华的办公室，探问斯大林同志的病究竟怎样了。
    “我们敬爱的斯大林同志逝世了！”支部书记沉痛地回答了大家。
    工人们立时低下了头，每个人的眼睛都凝视着地板，喉咙哽咽着，谁都不能再说出一句话来。
    “同志们，我们悲痛，我们难过，但是我们只有加倍地努力来实现斯大林同志的遗训。”支部书记压制着自己的感情说。
    老钎工王瑞清才从街上散步回来，突然感到厂子里像死一样地沉寂，只见青年工人彭少华的脸上沾满了眼泪。王瑞清已感到出了不幸的事情。
    “怎么啦？”他问。
    “斯大林同志逝世了！”
    这是一个沉重的打击，太沉重了，以致王瑞清连哭都哭不出来。他低着头回身就冲出了工厂的大门，“斯大林，亲爱的斯大林！”想着想着，他的眼泪就流下来了。他走过李老师父的家，他是惯常到李师父家去坐一坐的，一进门，李师父的老婆看他精神不太好，就问他：“王师父，怎么啦？”他把不幸的消息告诉了李大嫂。李大嫂和李师父老俩口子在解放后生活过得安安贴贴，他们常惦念着毛主席和斯大林。老大嫂悲叹着说：
        “像斯大林这样的好人，要活一百五十岁才对呢！”
        “可不是？活两百岁才应该呢！”
    王师父和李大嫂相对无言，沉默地坐了一会。
    夜晚九时，王师父回到宿舍，这是新建筑的工人宿舍，他走进自己的房间，倒在床上，蒙上被子悲痛地思索着许多事情。这一天是他的夜班，但是他睡不着，他想到解放后工人阶级的翻身；想到他在参加荆江分洪工程时风里来雨里去的苏联专家布可夫同志；想到伟大祖国的建设；又想到毛主席和斯大林……，这样，老工人王瑞清度着他的悲痛的时辰。
    突然他的小徒弟闯进门来。
    “王师父，机器坏了。”
    王瑞清从床上坐起来，套上鞋就往工厂里跑。
    一架磨床停止了转动。这是制造汽车活塞环的第二部生产过程，别的机器都等着磨床转动。这一夜王师父在磨床旁边紧张地劳动着，好像斯大林在旁边看着他修理机器一样，他从当夜十二点一直工作到第二天下午五点钟，他说：“不，我不能休息，为了悼念斯大林，我要完成任务。”直到机器恢复了转动的时候。
    三月八日清晨，全厂职工一百多人，聚集在工厂大礼堂举行追悼会，国际歌震荡着每个工人的心。党支部书记在追悼会上说：“为纪念斯大林同志的逝世，我们要保证超额完成生产任务。”这是对斯大林同志的誓言。这个工厂在推广了苏联先进经验后，在生产上有了显著的提高，高速度切削法把车床由每分钟三百转提高到一千转，多刀多刃使机器从一把刀增加到八把刀。全厂工人在追悼会后，决心把悲痛变为力量，每一个工人，每一个生产小组，都展开了对三月份生产计划的讨论，他们要争取比二月份增加一倍的产品。
    这是对斯大林同志的庄严的誓言。青年工人朱振国说：“斯大林同志逝世了，但是斯大林同志的精神还活着，我们永远也不会忘记斯大林，他一生都为我们劳动人民的利益而辛苦。我要牢牢地记住斯大林。只要想起了斯大林，我就会有勇气去克服一切困难。”
    老钎工王瑞清向斯大林同志保证：“我们保证及时供应全厂各生产小组的工具，同时修理好机器，消灭故障，支援各生产小组，完成三月份生产任务！”他说：“我要加紧工作，努力学习，提高觉悟，争取参加中国共产党。”
    三月八日下午四时，王瑞清参加了共产党支部举办的党课学习。
    全厂工人好像都在同声地说：亲爱的斯大林同志，我们向你宣誓，我们一定努力增加生产，加强抗美援朝，建设自己的祖国，并和苏联老大哥团结一心，打击侵略者，保卫世界和平。
