Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: More than 30,000 Japanese workers held a large-scale demonstration in Tokyo to oppose the Yoshida government and its proposed fascist legislation, including a bill restricting strikes.

    The demonstration was organized by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan. Shortly after noon on the 14th, large numbers of workers poured into Hibiya Park. At the rally, the workers expressed their determination to oppose the Yoshida government's fascist bills, especially the bill restricting strikes passed by the House of Representatives on the 13th.

    A large number of American military police and Japanese police stood guard around the venue. After the rally, the crowd, hand in hand, sang songs, walked out of the venue, and held a demonstration in the downtown area of Tokyo. They held up signs reading "American soldiers go home," and distributed leaflets along the way, calling for peace, opposing rearmament, and opposing the pro-American Yoshida government.

    About 5,000 demonstrators surrounded the Diet building where a meeting was being held, shouting "Down with the Yoshida government" and singing the Internationale. They protested to the Diet against the Yoshida government's rearmament policy, opposed anti-labor bills, and demanded wage increases.

    Prior to this, tens of thousands of Japanese teachers in Tokyo and other places went on strike on the 12th to protest the so-called compulsory education bill that deprived them of their political rights. 15,000 teachers in Tokyo held a demonstration on the same day.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese people's struggle against the series of fascist bills proposed by the Yoshida government to the Diet to deprive the people of their rights is becoming more and more激昂.

    Japanese teachers and staff resolutely oppose the so-called bill for the state treasury to bear the cost of compulsory national education, which aims to deprive the vast number of Japanese teachers and staff of the right to participate in political activities. On March 7th, the Japan Teachers' Union began a hunger strike. Many members of the teachers' unions in 30 prefectures, including Tokyo, Hokkaido, Akita, Fukushima, and Shizuoka, participated in this struggle. In Tokyo, four central executive committee members of the Japan Teachers' Union declared an indefinite hunger strike in front of the side gate of the House of Councillors.

    Under the influence of the people's strong opposition, the governors (local chief executives) of eight prefectures, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Aichi, also decided at a meeting held on February 13th to oppose the Yoshida government's bill for the state treasury to bear the cost of compulsory education and the revised Police Law bill to revive the pre-war fascist police system in Japan.

    At the same time, the Yoshida government's bill restricting strikes has also aroused immense anger and opposition from the Japanese working class. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan issued a statement on March 2nd opposing the bill, and emphasized that this bill not only attempts to obstruct and suppress the trade union movement and deprive trade unions of the right to strike, but also will push the Japanese people onto the road of war. One of the main targets of this bill, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, held a seven-day national conference in Ito City, Shizuoka Prefecture, starting on February 27th. The conference decided to make all preparations for its affiliated unions in order to carry out a forceful struggle, including strikes, at any time after March 14th, in order to oppose the bill restricting strikes. The conference also decided that if the employers take measures to dismiss union members during the workers' struggle, they will fight the employers with strikes.

    In view of the growing struggle of the Japanese people against the Yoshida government, the opposition Japan Progressive Party and the left-wing and right-wing Socialist Parties have decided to submit a motion of no confidence in the Yoshida cabinet to the Diet around March 17th, when the workers' struggle reaches its climax.

    日本工人示威反对吉田政府的法西斯法案
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：三万多名日本工人在东京举行了一个大规模的示威运动，反对吉田政府和它所拟制的限制罢工法案等法西斯立法。
    这次示威是由日本工会总评议会主持的。在十四日刚过中午，大批的工人就涌入日比谷公园。在示威大会上，工人群众表示了他们反对吉田政府的法西斯法案，特别是十三日众院通过的限制罢工法案的决心。
    大批的美国宪兵和日本警察在会场四周警戒。在大会结束后，群众手携着手，唱着歌，走出会场，在东京闹市中举行示威游行。他们举着“美国兵滚回去”的标语牌，并沿途散发传单，这些传单要求和平、反对重新武装和反对亲美的吉田政府。
    约有五千名示威的群众包围了正在举行会议的国会大厦，高呼“打倒吉田政府”，并唱国际歌。他们向国会抗议吉田政府的重新武装政策，反对反劳工法案，要求增加工资。
    在此以前，东京等地的日本教师数万人在十二日罢教，抗议剥夺他们的政治权利的所谓义务教育法案。东京一万五千名教师并在当天举行了示威游行。
    【新华社讯】东京消息：日本人民反对吉田政府向国会提出的一系列剥夺人民权利的法西斯法案的斗争情绪，一天比一天激昂起来。
    日本的教职员坚决反对所谓由国库负担国民义务教育费用的法案，这个法案的目的在于剥夺广大的日本教职员参加政治活动的权利。三月七日，日本教职员工会开始展开绝食斗争。参加这一斗争的有东京、北海道、秋田、福岛、静冈等全国三十个都、道、府、县的教职员工会的许多会员。在东京，日本教职员工会的中央执行委员四人在参议院边门前宣告实行无一定限期的绝食。
    在人民强烈的反对情绪的影响下，东京、大阪、爱知等八个都、府、县的知事（地方长官）在二月十三日召开的会议中，也决定反对吉田政府的由国库负担义务教育费用法案和重新复活日本战前法西斯警察制度的修改警察法案。
    同时，吉田政府的限制罢工法案，也引起日本工人阶级的无比愤怒和反对。日本工会总评议会在三月二日发表声明，反对这个法案，并且强调指出，这个法案不仅企图阻挠和镇压工会运动、剥夺工会的罢工权利，而且将把日本人民推向战争的道路。这个法案的主要对象之一——日本煤矿工会——于二月二十七日起在静冈县伊东市举行了七天全国大会。大会决定为了反对限制罢工法案，要求所属工会作好一切准备，以便在三月十四日以后随时举行包括罢工在内的实力斗争。大会同时决定，如果资方在工人的斗争中采取解雇工会会员的措施，就以罢工的方式和资方进行斗争。
    鉴于日本人民反对吉田政府的斗争愈来愈高涨，日本资产阶级在野党改进党、左派和右派社会党已经决定在工人的斗争达到高潮的三月十七日左右，在国会提出对吉田内阁不信任案。
