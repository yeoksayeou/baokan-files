Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 24th - On March 9th, the U.S. side shelled the Panmunjom conference area of the Korean armistice negotiations. Our chief liaison officer lodged a protest with the U.S. side on March 11th regarding this serious violation of the conference area agreement. At the liaison officers' meeting on March 23rd, the U.S. side had to admit that at least two U.S. military shells landed in the conference area on March 9th; however, on the other hand, the U.S. side once again falsely claimed that such incidents were caused by our positions near the conference area, attempting to use this absurd excuse, which had nothing to do with the conference area, to deny its responsibility for deliberately undermining the agreement. The U.S. side even claimed with extreme shamelessness that the fundamental responsibility for the U.S. side's "accidental stray shells into the conference area" lies with our side. Our liaison officer immediately pointed out sternly that all the facts of the U.S. shelling of the conference area on March 9th had been confirmed by the eyewitness accounts and physical evidence jointly investigated by the security officers of both sides in the conference area. The U.S. side's groundless and absurd excuses cannot in the slightest degree reduce the U.S. side's responsibility for undermining the agreement, but only serve to prove that after taking a series of provocative actions, the U.S. side deliberately continues to undermine the maintenance of the conference area. The U.S. side must bear full responsibility for these serious violations of the agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 24th - The U.S. side has again beaten to death one of our captured personnel in the Dragon Island prisoner-of-war camp. This is another massacre committed by the U.S. side in Dragon Island after the use of poison gas to attack prisoners of war on March 19th.

    我方联络官斥美方抵赖炮击会场区的责任
    【新华社开城二十四日电】三月九日美方炮击朝鲜停战谈判板门店会场区，我方首席联络官在三月十一日对这一严重违反会场区协议的事件向美方提出了抗议。三月二十三日双方联络官会议上，美方不得不承认三月九日至少有两发美军炮弹射入会场区；但另一方面美方竟再次妄称此类事件是由于会场区附近有我方阵地而招致的，企图藉这种与会场区丝毫无关的荒谬藉口抵赖其蓄意破坏协议的责任。美方更极端无耻地声称：美方“炮弹偶而误射入会场区”的基本责任，在于我方。我方联络官当即严正指出：三月九日美方炮击会场区的全部事实，已经会场区双方安全军官共同调查时的人证与物证所证实，美方毫无事实根据的荒谬藉口，丝毫不能减轻美方破坏协议的责任，而只足以证明美方在采取一连串挑衅行动后，蓄意继续破坏会场区的维持。美方对这些严重违反协议的事件，必须负完全责任。
    【新华社开城二十四日电】美方在龙草岛战俘营中又打死我方被俘人员一名。这是美方在龙草岛继三月十九日用毒气进攻战俘以后制造的又一次屠杀事件。
