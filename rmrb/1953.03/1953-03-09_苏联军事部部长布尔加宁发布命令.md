    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 8th: TASS Moscow, March 8th: Soviet Minister of War, Marshal of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, issued the following order to the Soviet army on the 8th:
    Comrade soldiers and sergeants of the Army! Comrade officers, colonels, and generals of the Army!
    Our people, our army have suffered a great misfortune. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the great leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet people, the leader of the Soviet state, the great Stalin, has passed away. The genius commander, Marshal of the Soviet Union, J.V. Stalin has left us. Stalin's name is infinitely dear to our party, to the Soviet people and their army, and to the working people of the world. Comrade Stalin dedicated his life to the cause of the people, to the cause of communist construction. Lenin and Stalin created, educated, and trained the powerful party of communists, established and consolidated the Soviet state and its armed forces. During the years of the civil war and the Great Patriotic War, the entire history of the Soviet army and its victories is inextricably linked with the name of the great Stalin. Under the leadership of its Supreme Commander, Marshal of the Soviet Union, J.V. Stalin, the Soviet armed forces, in accordance with his genius plan, thoroughly defeated fascist Germany and imperialist Japan, defended the freedom and independence of their motherland, and saved the people of Europe and Asia from fascist enslavement. The Soviet army lowers its military flag over the coffin of its genius commander with extreme grief.
    Comrade soldiers and sergeants! Comrade officers, colonels, and generals! We must unite our ranks more closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet government. In parting with our dear teacher, leader, and commander Comrade Stalin, we swear: to tirelessly strengthen the combat effectiveness of the Soviet army, strengthen its combat readiness, raise constant vigilance, reliably protect the creative labor of the Soviet people, and vigilantly defend the national interests of the Soviet Union. The Soviet people are deeply convinced that their army is faithful to the immortal legacy of Stalin and is always ready to gloriously fulfill its sacred duty to the Soviet motherland.
    Soviet Minister of War, Marshal of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin

    我们人民、我们军队遭到了很大的不幸。苏联部长会议主席、苏联共产党中央委员会书记、共产党和苏联人民的伟大领袖、苏维埃国家的领导者伟大的斯大林逝世了。天才的统帅、苏联大元帅约·维·斯大林离开了我们。斯大林的名字对我们党、对苏联人民以及他们的军队、对全世界劳动人民是无限亲爱的。斯大林同志把他的一生献给了人民的事业，献给了共产主义建设的事业。列宁和斯大林缔造、教育和锻炼了强大的共产主义者的党，建立和巩固了苏维埃国家和它的武装部队。在国内战争和伟大卫国战争的年代里，苏联军队和它的胜利的全部历史是与伟大斯大林的名字不可分地联结在一起。苏联武装部队在它的最高统帅、苏联大元帅约·维·斯大林的率领下，遵照他的天才的计划，彻底击溃了法西斯德国和帝国主义日本，保卫住了自己祖国的自由和独立，把欧洲和亚洲的人民从法西斯奴役下拯救出来。苏联军队以万分沉痛的心情把自己的军旗垂在自己的天才统帅的灵柩上面。
    战士和士官同志们！尉官、校官和将军同志们！我们要更紧密地把我们的队伍团结在共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围。在和亲爱的导师、领袖和统帅斯大林同志分别的时候，我们宣誓：要不倦地加强苏联军队的战斗力，加强它的战斗准备，提高经常的警惕性，可靠地保护苏联人民的创造性劳动，警醒地捍卫苏联的国家利益。苏联人民深信，他们的军队忠实于不朽的斯大林的遗训，永远准备着光荣地执行他们对苏维埃祖国的神圣责任。
    苏联军事部部长、苏联元帅尼·亚·布尔加宁
