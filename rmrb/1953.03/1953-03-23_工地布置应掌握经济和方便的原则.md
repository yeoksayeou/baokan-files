    Construction Site Layout Should Adhere to Principles of Economy and Convenience
    Wu Haofu, Deputy Engineer, Fifth Engineering Department, Northeast Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau

    Construction organization design is an important part of construction preparation. Without doing this work well, many tasks cannot be carried out. We started earlier this year and have now completed the first step of construction organization design: construction site layout. Based on the situation in this stage of work, we believe the following issues should be noted:

    I. Division of labor must be clearly defined. In the past, before construction, the site director or engineering team leader often played a lone role, having to plan, survey, and arrange temporary construction. As a result, they were unable to attend to everything and the work was difficult to do well. Learning from this lesson, this year we established three temporary institutions: a construction organization design group, a surveying group, and a temporary construction team. We used the construction organization design group as the core to drive the work, concentrating our forces and proceeding separately, which had a very good effect.

    II. Maximize the use of existing buildings to save national investment. This year we will establish woodworking, model making, ironworking, and concrete mixing factories. The selection of these factory sites should make maximum use of existing buildings near the construction area. This is both economical and convenient. For example, there was already a lumber mill in our woodworking area, equipped with narrow-gauge railways. In order to save timber transportation costs, we decided to expand this lumber mill. The woodworking factory was located near the lumber mill, and finished products can be transported to the entire area via the narrow-gauge railway in the future. A certain amount of open space was also left around it for stacking logs, finished timber, and finished products. The iron factory was located near the material warehouse for easy stacking of steel. Some of the workers' dormitories were also expanded in the original area, prepared for ordinary workers, concrete workers, and tile workers. Another part was located near the woodworking factory and the riveting and welding factory, specifically for woodworking and riveting and welding workers. At the same time, welfare facilities such as canteens, cooperatives, bathhouses, barbershops, laundries, and health stations were appropriately arranged.

    III. The location of auxiliary factories must pay attention to the convenience of construction and the distance between them. We will set up the concrete mixing plant on the open space opposite the work area. The location is central, the terrain is high, and there is a large open space nearby where sand and gravel can be piled and prefabricated parts can be placed. The model board yard is set up in front of the concrete mixing plant, and finished products can be transported into the site via narrow-gauge railway. Except for the section entering the mixing plant, which is double-tracked due to frequent entry and exit, the narrow-gauge railway is set up as a loop, moving in a certain direction to avoid collisions between loaded and unloaded cars, which would hinder traffic. The mixing plant should be located as far as possible in the direction of sand and gravel entering the site, so that sand and gravel are easy to replenish and transportation costs are saved. In order to equalize the sand and gravel transportation time, sand and gravel should be stacked alternately (i.e., a pile of stones, a pile of sand, stacked alternately), leaving transportation roads in the middle for continuous replenishment and use in the future, as well as setting up narrow-gauge railways.

    IV. The stacking position of materials should consider the order and quantity needed for the project, as well as the order of use and the convenience of work and access. It is also necessary to pay attention to reserving appropriate gaps in the site to avoid hindering future work. If the site is small and there are many materials, an open space can be found at one end in the direction of incoming materials for temporary stacking, and no backtracking will be required when transferring them later. Heavy and large quantities of materials that are inconvenient to load and unload and do not incur much stacking loss (such as bricks, tiles, stones, etc.) should be scattered as much as possible in places convenient for application to avoid repeated transfer. Materials that are easy to load and unload and incur large losses but are small in quantity (such as sand, cement, lime, etc.) should not be stacked too dispersedly. Transportation roads must be smooth and prevent materials from blocking the roads. No items are allowed to be stacked within a certain distance around the building, not only for the convenience of earth excavation and material entry, but also to avoid the pressure on the ditches causing them to collapse during future excavation. The location of the material warehouse should be close to the dedicated transportation line on the one hand to reduce transportation costs, and on the other hand, it should accommodate places where the amount of application is large. For example, cement is used the most in the mixing plant, so the cement warehouse is located on both sides of the mixing plant; the office uses more white lime, so the white lime warehouse is located near the office.

    V. Problems such as roads and water supply should be carefully considered. Drainage ditches should be dug on both sides of the road, and seepage wells should be dug every 50 meters to drain surface rainwater. In terms of water and electricity, the correct water consumption and electricity consumption should first be calculated according to the project situation, including both engineering and domestic use. In terms of water sources, in addition to digging wells and setting up two temporary water towers according to the water consumption situation, we also set up temporary waterways and dug storage ponds in appropriate locations to store a considerable amount of water, to prevent work from still being carried out in case of a power outage, and can also be used as fire-fighting water.

    工地布置应掌握经济和方便的原则
    东北有色金属工业管理局第五工程处副工程师　吴浩甫
    施工组织设计是施工准备中的重要工作，不做好这项工作，很多工作都无法进行。今年我们动手较早，现在已完成了施工组织设计的第一步——工地布置。根据这一段工作的情况，我们认为应该注意以下几个问题：
    一、必须明确分工。过去我们在施工之前，往往是工地主任或工程队长一个人唱独脚戏，既要计划，又要测量，还要布置暂设工程。结果顾此失彼，工作难以做好。接受这一教训，今年我们成立了施工组织设计组、测量组、暂设工程队等三个临时性的机构，而以施工组织设计组为核心来推动工作，集中力量分头进行，效果很好。
    二、尽量利用现有建筑物，节省国家投资。今年我们要设立木工、模型、铁工、混凝土搅拌等工厂。这些厂址的选择，应尽量利用建设区附近现有的建筑物。这样，既经济，又方便。例如我们木工区原有一个制材厂，设有轻便铁道。为了节省木材搬运费，我们就决定扩充这个制材厂，木工厂就设在制材厂附近，日后成品可以由轻便铁道运至全区。周围也留出一定的空地，以便堆置原木、成材与成品。铁工厂则设在材料库附近，以便堆置钢材。一部分工人宿舍也是在原地区扩充的，准备给普通工、混凝土工、瓦工等住用。另外一部分设在木工厂和铆焊工厂附近，专住木工及铆焊工。同时并适当地配置了食堂、合作社、浴室、理发室、洗衣房、卫生所等福利设施。
    三、附属工厂位置的选择，必须注意施工上的便利及相互间的距离。混凝土搅拌厂我们将设在工区对面的空地上，地点适中，地势较高，附近并有较大的空地，可以堆置砂石，又可放预制品。混凝土搅拌厂前面就设置模型板场，做出成品即可由轻便铁道运进场内。轻便铁道除在进搅拌厂的一段，因为进出频繁设双轨外，其余设成一回路，向一定方向行进，以免轻重车冲突，阻碍交通。搅拌厂尽可能设在砂石进场的方向上，使砂石易于补充，节省搬运费。为使砂石运输时间相等，砂石应交错堆放
    （即一堆石子，一堆砂子间隔堆），中间留下交通道路，以便日后陆续补充，以及应用时设轻便铁道。
    四、材料的堆放位置，应考虑到工程次序和需要数量以及使用先后、工作取用方便等条件，并须注意预留适当的空隙场地，以免妨碍日后工作。要是场地小材料多，可在来料方向的一头找空地暂为堆置，以后倒运时可不走回头道。笨重而数量多，装卸不便与堆置损耗不大的材料（如砖瓦、石头等），应尽可能分散在便于应用的场所，避免再次倒运；装卸方便与损耗大而数量较少的材料（如砂、水泥、石灰等），不要堆藏得太分散。运输道路一定要畅通，要防止材料阻塞道路。建筑物四周一定距离内不准堆放任何东西，这不但是为了出土、进料方便，并且还可避免日后挖土时地沟受压崩倒。材料仓库位置的选择，一方面要靠近专运线，可减少搬运费，另一方面还要迁就应用数量大的地方。例如水泥是搅拌厂用得最多，因此水泥库就设在搅拌厂的两旁；办公室用白灰较多，白灰仓库就设在办公室附近。五、道路，给水等问题要周密考虑。道路两侧应挖设排水沟，每距五十公尺挖一渗水井，以排泄地面雨水。在水、电方面，首先应根据工程情况计算出正确的用水量和用电量，应包括工程用和生活用两种。在水源方面，我们除根据用水情况挖井和设置了两座临时水塔以外，并设置了临时水道，在适当地点挖设蓄水池，储藏相当数量的水，以防万一停电时，仍可进行工作，并可兼作消防用水。
