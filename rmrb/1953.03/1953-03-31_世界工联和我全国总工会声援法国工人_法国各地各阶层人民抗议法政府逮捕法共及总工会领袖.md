Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 28th: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) sent a telegram to the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) regarding the recent arrest of trade union leaders and searches of union offices by the French government, supporting the French working class's struggle against persecution. The telegram stated: The reactionaries' new and blatant attack on the French CGT is a violation of trade union rights and democratic rights. This attack has aroused the indignation of working people around the world. The arrests of trade union leaders and André Stil, as well as the arrests of Alain Le Léap and leaders of the French Republican Youth Union in October 1952, once again prove that the French reactionaries have begun to abolish all democratic rights and freedoms guaranteed by the French Constitution. This is a direct result of their implementation of anti-people policies.

The telegram pointed out: In 1951, on the eve of the then French Prime Minister's departure for Washington, he ordered the banning of the WFTU's presence in France in order to ensure the success of his mission. Now, on the eve of embarking on a similar trip, the French Prime Minister feels it is also necessary to give some assurances to the Americans in the form of attacking the French CGT. Working people in all countries clearly recognize that the fascist measures taken by the French reactionaries are caused by their desire to please their masters across the Atlantic. The French government tolerates the existence of American "institutions" in France, whose sole purpose is to subordinate the French economy to American capital and to subject the national life of France to the wishes of Washington politicians. The French government adopts a laissez-faire attitude towards the anti-national activities of foreigners, but adopts a criminal attitude towards the French CGT, which has been established for more than 60 years. This is a public insult to the French people.

The telegram expressed solidarity and support for the French CGT and the French working people, and pointed out that only unity can prevent the reactionaries from realizing their sinister plans.

The telegram stated: The WFTU will lodge a serious protest with the United Nations, protesting the French government's violation of trade union rights and use of force, and demanding that the normal activities of the French CGT and the free exercise of trade union rights be guaranteed.

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) sent a telegram to the French government on the 29th, protesting the illegal arrest of French trade union leaders and André Stil, editor-in-chief of "l'Humanité." At the same time, it sent a telegram to the French CGT expressing solidarity with the struggle of the French working class.

The ACFTU's protest telegram to the French government stated: "While CGT General Secretary Alain Le Léap and other peace fighters are still being illegally held in prison, the French government authorities on the 24th of this month again unreasonably arrested patriotic and peace-loving warriors, CGT Organization Secretary Lucion Molino, Secretary of the Seine Provincial Trade Union Federation André Doé, and ‘l'Humanité’ editor-in-chief André Stil, and attempted to arrest CGT General Secretary Benoît Frachon and the Secretary of the Federation of Government Employees, Marcel Dufriche. They also searched the offices of trade union organizations without cause. The Chinese working class is extremely indignant upon learning of this. This conspiratorial atrocity occurred today, when the French people's movement against the Bonn and Paris war treaties is vigorously developing throughout the country, and when the entire French people are increasingly resolutely demanding an end to the dirty colonial war in Vietnam. It more fully exposes that the French government authorities are further betraying national interests and succumbing to the war policies of US imperialism. The Chinese working class fully supports the protests of the French working people and demands the immediate restoration of freedom to Molino, Doé, Stil, and Le Léap, and the cessation of persecution of Frachon and Dufriche."

The ACFTU's telegram to the French CGT stated: "The Chinese working class is extremely indignant at this atrocity by the French government and has expressed its protest to the French government. The Chinese working class fully supports the actions of the French working people's struggle and firmly believes that the French working people will unite more closely, advance bravely, and strive for the release of comrades Molino, Doé, Stil, and Le Léap, and to stop the persecution of comrades Frachon and Dufriche. The Chinese people and all good people around the world will forever stand with the French working people."

According to Xinhua News Agency: The movement protesting the government authorities' arrest of Communist Party and trade union leaders is rapidly developing among people from all strata of society throughout France.

Short protest strikes were held in Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux, Lille, and many other cities. More than 1,000 dockworkers in Marseille went on strike on the 25th. Miners in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais departments announced a 24-hour strike.

On the 26th, more than 600 students from the University of Paris held a demonstration on Boulevard Saint-Michel. Their slogans were: "Restore freedom to Alain Le Léap and André Stil!" "Fascism must not succeed!" The police attacked the students and arrested several people.

Letters, telegrams, and petitions demanding an end to the use of police repression are pouring in from all over the country to the President, the government, and the investigating judge of the Paris Military Tribunal. The Catholic trade unions of Isère, the faculty of the Collège de France, and many famous scientists, artists, writers, doctors, lawyers, and clergymen have all demanded that the government authorities respect democratic freedoms and release the arrested peace fighters.

"l'Humanité" reported: French Communist Party Secretary Duclos, speaking at a meeting of party activists in the Seine department, pointed out that the government's recent arrest of leaders of democratic organizations was to prove its willingness to implement the Americans' policy of suppression. But the French people and the working class will surely be able to gather their strength and fight for the release of the arrested patriots.

    世界工联和我全国总工会声援法国工人
    法国各地各阶层人民抗议法政府逮捕法共及总工会领袖
   【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十八日讯：世界工会联合会就最近法国政府逮捕工会领袖和搜查工会办公处这件事打电报给法国总工会，支援法国工人阶级的反迫害斗争。电报说：反动派对法国总工会进行的新的罪恶昭彰的攻击，侵犯了工会权利和民主权利。这种攻击已经引起全世界劳动人民的愤慨。这次逮捕工会领袖和安德烈·斯梯以及一九五二年十月逮捕阿兰·勒里普和法兰西共和青年联盟领袖的行为，再一次证明法国反动派已经开始废除法国宪法所保证的一切民主权利和自由了。这是他们执行反人民政策的直接结果。
    电报指出：一九五一年，当时的法国政府总理在去华盛顿前夕，为了保证他的使命的成功，曾经下令禁止世界工会联合会设在法国。现在，法国总理在开始同样旅行的前夕，认为也有必要以攻击法国总工会的形式来给美国人一些保证。世界各国的劳动人民都清楚地认识：法国反动派所采取的法西斯措施是他们想取悦大西洋彼岸的主子的愿望引起来的。法国政府容忍美国的“机构”在法国存在，这种“机构”的唯一目的，就是要使法国的经济附属于美国的资本，使法国的国民生活服从华盛顿政客的愿望。法国政府对于外国人的反民族活动采取放任态度，对于成立了六十多年的法国总工会却采取罪恶的态度，这是对法国人民的公开污辱。
    电报对法国总工会和法国劳动人民表示声援和支持，并且指出只有团结一致才能使反动派不能实现他们的罪恶计划。
    电报说：世界工会联合会将向联合国提出严重抗议，抗议法国政府破坏工会权利和使用武力，并要求保障法国总工会的正常活动和工会权利的自由行使。
    【新华社三十日讯】中华全国总工会二十九日致电法国政府，抗议非法逮捕法国工会领袖和“人道报”总编辑安德烈·斯梯。同时还致电法国总工会声援法国工人阶级的斗争。
    中华全国总工会给法国政府的抗议电说：“当法国总工会总书记阿兰·勒里普及其他和平斗士仍被非法关在监狱的时候，法国政府当局于本月二十四日又无理逮捕爱国志士与和平战士、法国总工会组织书记吕希欧·摩林诺，塞纳省工会联合会书记安德烈·道埃以及‘人道报’总编辑安德烈·斯梯，并妄图逮捕法国总工会总书记贝诺瓦·弗拉商和政府机关员工联合会总书记马赛尔·杜弗里希，而且还无端搜查工会组织的办事处。中国工人阶级获悉之余，感到万分愤慨。这一阴谋暴行发生在法国人民反对波恩和巴黎战争条约的运动正在全国蓬勃开展，全法国人民日益坚决要求结束肮脏的越南殖民战争的今天，更充分地暴露了法国政府当局是在进一步背叛民族利益，屈从美帝国主义战争政策。中国工人阶级完全支持法国劳动人民的抗议，要求立即恢复摩林诺、道埃、斯梯以及勒里普等人的自由，并停止对弗拉商和杜弗里希的迫害。”
    中华全国总工会在给法国总工会的电报里说：“中国工人阶级对法国政府的这种暴行异常愤慨，并已向法国政府表示抗议。中国工人阶级完全支持法国劳动人民抗争的行动，坚信法国劳动人民将更加团结一致，英勇前进，为争取释放摩林诺、道埃、斯梯以及勒里普等同志、为制止对弗拉商和杜弗里希二同志的迫害而奋斗。中国人民和全世界一切善良的人们是永远与法国劳动人民站在一道的。”
    据新华社讯：抗议政府当局逮捕共产党和工会领袖的运动，在法国全国各阶层人民中迅速发展。
    巴黎、里昂、波尔多、里尔及其他许多城市，都举行短时间抗议罢工。马赛一千多码头工人在二十五日举行罢工。诺尔省和加来海峡省的矿工宣布罢工二十四小时。
    二十六日，巴黎大学六百多个学生在圣米塞尔大街举行示威。他们的口号是：“恢复阿兰·勒里普和安德烈·斯梯的自由！”“法西斯主义绝不能得逞！”警察向学生们进攻，并且逮捕了好几个人。
    要求停止采取警察镇压手段的信件、电报和请愿书，源源不绝地从全国各地寄给总统、政府和巴黎军事法庭侦察庭法官。伊塞尔省的天主教工会、法兰西学院的教员以及许多有名的科学家、艺术家、作家、医生、律师和教士，都要求政府当局尊重民主自由，释放被捕和平战士。
    “人道报”报道：法国共产党书记杜克洛在塞纳省党的积极分子会议上讲话时指出：政府最近逮捕民主组织的领袖，是为了要证明它愿意执行美国人的镇压政策。但是法国人民和工人阶级一定能够集合他们的力量，争取释放被捕爱国者。
