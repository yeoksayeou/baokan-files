    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 3rd: According to TASS, the Vienna meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions closed on February 28th. The meeting adopted resolutions on the reports made by Louis Saillant and Ilio Bessi.
    The resolution adopted on Saillant's report on "The Tasks and Methods of Activity of Trade Union Solidarity of Working People in the Struggle for Higher Wages, Against Unemployment, and for Trade Union Rights" pointed out that the situation of the broad masses of working people in capitalist countries has further deteriorated due to the policies of war, hunger, and poverty. The main task of the working class is to establish a united front of working people to oppose the war makers and the attacks of monopoly capital.
    The resolution stated: The Executive Committee recommends that the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Trade Union Internationals, national trade unions, and all trade union organizations widely promote the experience of united worker action in the struggle to raise wages, fight for trade union rights and freedoms, oppose unemployment and war preparations. National and industrial conferences of workers should be held in appropriate places in capitalist and colonial countries to defend economic and social rights, oppose economic militarization, oppose unemployment, and involve all workers (regardless of their trade union affiliation) and unorganized workers in these conferences. In countries where trade unions have not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions due to the sabotage of splitters, efforts should be made to establish organizations of trade union activists around the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Internationals. Strengthen the international solidarity of working people.
    The resolution stipulates the tasks of trade union organizations in the struggle to raise wages, oppose unemployment, and fight for trade union rights. The resolution states: The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions believes that the principle of united action is the basis for the success of trade union activities and is the decisive task in the labor movement today. The World Federation of Trade Unions' movement to strive for united action and the unity of the labor movement represents its main proposition. The resolution finally calls: In the struggle for better living and working conditions, for peace and democratic freedom, establish a strong united front of the working class.
    In the resolution adopted on Bessi's report on strengthening the struggle of agricultural workers, the meeting called for intensifying the struggle of agricultural workers and expressed support for their economic and social demands.
    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 2nd: According to TASS, the Vienna meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions passed a resolution on supporting the declaration and letter to the five major powers of the World People's Peace Congress. The resolution states: In order for trade unions to complete the major tasks assigned by the World People's Peace Congress, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on all workers and their trade union organizations to take the following actions:
    Use all means to widely publicize the declaration and letter to the five major powers of the World People's Peace Congress, mobilize and unite the masses of workers to struggle for peace and against the threat of another world war.
    Tirelessly explain to the workers in capitalist and colonial countries that the increasingly deteriorating conditions of their material lives are a direct result of the imperialists' preparations for launching another world war, and at the same time explain to them that stopping the expansion of the arms race will expand peaceful production and normal economic relations between all countries, and can reduce unemployment and improve the living standards of working people.
    Broadly develop various forms of workers' struggle for peace - the activities of peace committees in enterprises, actions to protect national industries, the struggle against the "Schuman Plan," workers' actions against the closure of enterprises producing civilian goods, and movements to protest the production and transportation of war materials.
    The struggle of the working people against the re-militarization of West Germany, against the revival of Japanese militarism, for an end to the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, and for a ban on the use of weapons of mass destruction are the most important tasks in the current struggle for peace.
    The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions agrees with and supports the joint appeal of the Free German Trade Union Federation, the French General Confederation of Labor, the Italian General Confederation of Labor, the Dutch General Confederation of Labor, the Belgian Miners' Federation, and the Luxembourg Free Trade Union Federation calling on all workers in Western Europe and their trade union organizations to prevent the ratification of the Bonn and Paris war treaties and to seek a peaceful solution to the German question.
    The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on all trade union organizations and workers in all countries to more actively support the struggle of the people of all countries for their national independence, which is a necessary condition for defending and consolidating peace.
    Strengthen the ranks of peace fighters, and absorb new strata of the people to join this just struggle of the people of all countries. The Executive Committee resolutely protests the capitalist countries' persecution of representatives who participated in the World People's Peace Congress and calls on all working people to demand an end to the persecution of peace fighters.
    The Executive Committee calls on all workers to more closely unite their brotherly ranks and take concerted action to defend peace and safeguard peace.

    决议规定了工会组织在争取提高工资、反对失业和争取工会权利的斗争中的任务。决议说：世界工联执行委员会认为行动一致的原则是工会活动成功的基础，并且是今天劳工运动中的决定性的工作。世界工联争取行动一致和劳工运动统一的运动，代表了它的主要主张。决议最后号召：在争取较好的生活和劳动条件、争取和平和民主自由的斗争中，建立起一个强大的工人阶级统一战线来。

    广泛地发展工人们争取和平斗争的各种形式——企业中的和平委员会的活动、保护民族工业的行动、反对“舒曼计划”的斗争、工人们反对关闭生产民用品的企业的行动、抗议战争物资的生产和运输的运动。
