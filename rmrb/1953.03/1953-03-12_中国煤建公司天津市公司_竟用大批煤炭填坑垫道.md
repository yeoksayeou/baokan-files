China Coal Construction Company Tianjin Branch
Actually Used Large Quantities of Coal to Fill Pits and Pave Roads

According to reader Zhu Min's letter, some staff members of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company Tianjin Branch used a large amount of good coal as soil to fill pits and pave roads. According to incomplete calculations, a total of more than 970 tons of good coal were lost. At a price of 150,000 yuan per ton, the total value is 146.5 million yuan.

In January 1951, the company rented the Second General Merchandise Factory as a coal storage yard. The ground of the factory was uneven and had nine drainage ditches, each more than 60 meters long, more than one meter wide, and more than one foot deep. The company did not repair or fill these pits and ditches, but started to import large amounts of coal in June of the same year. By November of the same year, coal had piled up like a mountain, burying many pits and ditches under the large stacks. Later, the coal was gradually transported out, but about 852 tons of coal in the pits and ditches were treated as soil and no one cleaned it up.

There were no roads for vehicles to enter and exit between the coal piles in the coal storage yard, and there was standing water in the low-lying areas, making it very difficult to transport coal. At that time, it was the peak season for coal sales in winter, and citizens urgently needed coal, but the coal-buying units could not transport it out for more than a month. Dozens of letters were sent to the company every day, but the company ignored the opinions of the masses. Later, under the supervision of the Municipal People's Government, the company sent Fu Zhendong, the head of the storage and transportation section, to the coal storage yard to study solutions. Fu Zhendong used 86 tons of good coal to pave a lane, and the problem of coal transportation was solved. However, horse-drawn carts transported back and forth on the coal-paved lane, and the coal was mixed with mud, water, and horse manure, so 86 tons of good coal were also wasted. In August 1952, a spontaneous combustion accident occurred in the coal piles in the factory. In order to pave the road for rescue, Fu Zhendong filled a ditch with another 30 tons of coal, but it was not cleared out afterwards.

The leading cadres of the municipal company have been unaware of these phenomena of damaging state property. It was not until November of last year, when the anti-bureaucratism struggle was launched, that workers from the coal plant reported it to the Tianjin Municipal People's Supervisory Committee. The Municipal People's Supervisory Committee organized an inspection team to conduct two on-site investigations. After raising these issues with Fu Zhendong, the head of the storage and transportation section of the company, Fu Zhendong denied them outright. The inspection team conducted a third inspection and pointed out this problem to Wang Peiji, the manager of the company. Wang Peiji replied subjectively: "These situations do not match the facts." The inspection team conducted a fourth in-depth on-site inspection and asked Wang Peiji, Fu Zhendong, and Liu Xing, the person in charge of the coal storage yard at the time, to compare the situation, but Wang Peiji and Fu Zhendong still refused to admit their mistakes and tried every means to shirk responsibility, attempting to minimize the matter. The inspection team finally dug out the coal filling the ditch for them to see, and they could no longer deny it and were forced to admit their mistakes. This incident has not yet been dealt with. It is hoped that the Tianjin Municipal People's Supervisory Committee and the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce will give Wang Peiji, Fu Zhendong, and others the punishment they deserve, and educate the staff of the Coal Construction Company to cherish state property.

### 中国煤建公司天津市公司  竟用大批煤炭填坑垫道

    中国煤建公司天津市公司
    竟用大批煤炭填坑垫道
    据读者朱敏来信揭露：中国煤业建筑器材公司天津市公司某些工作人员用大量好煤当成泥土填坑垫道，据不完全的计算，共损失好煤九百七十余吨，每吨按十五万元计算，共值人民币一亿四千六百五十余万元。
    该公司在一九五一年一月曾租妥第二南货厂作储煤厂。该厂地高洼不平，并掘有九条长六十余公尺、宽一公尺多、深一尺多的泄水沟。该公司对这些坑沟不加修垫，就在同年六月份开始大量进煤。至同年十一月份煤炭堆积如山，将许多沟坑压在大垛底下，后来将煤陆续运出，但坑沟里面的存煤约八百五十二吨，却被当成泥土，无人加以清理。
    这个储煤厂的煤垛之间没有留出车辆进出的道路，低洼处又有积水，运煤甚为困难。当时正值冬季煤炭畅销季节，市民急需用煤，但买煤单位一个多月还运不出来。每日有数十封信反映到公司里，公司对群众意见置之不理；后经市人民政府督促，公司才派储运科长傅振东到储煤厂研究解决办法。傅振东用了八十六吨好煤垫了一条车道，运煤的问题算是解决了。但马车在煤垫的车道上往返运输，煤和泥水、马粪混在一起，八十六吨好煤也就糟蹋了。一九五二年八月厂内煤垛曾发生自燃事故，为了垫路抢救，傅振东又以三十吨煤填了一个水沟，但事后又没有清出。
    这些损害国家财产的现象，市公司领导干部一直不知道。直到去年十一月开展反官僚主义斗争时，经煤厂工人向天津市人民监察委员会检举，市人民监察委员会组织检查组到现场进行了两次调查，向该公司储运科科长傅振东提出这些问题以后，傅振东还一口否认。检查组又进行了第三次检查，并向该公司经理王培基指出这一问题，王培基还主观地回答：“这些情况和事实不符”。检查组又第四次深入现场检查，并请王培基、傅振东和当时的储煤厂负责人刘兴等对照情况，但王培基、傅振东仍不承认错误，千方百计推卸责任，企图把事情缩小。检查组最后挖出填沟的煤给他们看，他们无法继续抵赖，才被迫承认了错误。这一事件至今还没有处理，希望天津市人民监察委员会和市工商局给王培基、傅振东等以应得的处分，并教育煤建公司的工作人员爱护国家财产。
