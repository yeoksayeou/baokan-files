    The North China Administrative Committee Issues Instructions on Strengthening Spring Plowing Leadership and Ensuring Timely Sowing
    The spring plowing season is now upon us. Quickly making all preparations for spring plowing work and ensuring timely sowing is of particularly important significance for completing and exceeding the major task of increasing agricultural production in 1953. To this end:
    1.  Agricultural production must be regarded as the overriding central task in rural areas. Any neglect or relaxation of leadership in agricultural production will result in irreparable losses. Leading comrades at all levels, especially those below the district and county levels, must focus their main energy on agricultural production, assign dedicated personnel to be responsible, and designate specialized agencies and full-time personnel to carry out daily work. They must organize cadres to go to the countryside for inspection and quickly establish technical guidance stations to strengthen the leadership and technical guidance of the spring plowing movement.
    2.  Combine the rural planning movement with a comprehensive patriotic production increase competition movement. All localities must strengthen the political and ideological education of farmers, with agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and state-owned farms as units, formulate patriotic production increase competition plans, and, with labor models taking the lead, launch a comprehensive patriotic production increase competition movement to tap the potential of agricultural production and strive to achieve the goal of large-scale and comprehensive production increases.
    3.  Strengthen drought prevention and resistance work and overcome blind optimism. Actively mobilize the masses to harrow and preserve soil moisture, develop small-scale water conservancy projects, advance spring irrigation, implement rational and economical water use, and do a good job in drought prevention and resistance preparations to ensure timely sowing.
    4.  Ensure the completion of the grain sowing plan; the cotton field area is neither allowed to be expanded nor reduced. If the local cotton field area is too concentrated, it should be appropriately adjusted, generally controlled below 50 percent of the total area, in order to adjust crop rotation. During the spring plowing and sowing period, it is necessary to firmly grasp technical guidance for the masses, be vigilant and prevent diseases and insect pests early, and ensure full seedlings for various crops. In particular, close planting should be taken as the center and vigorously promoted, striving for 40 percent of major crops (such as cotton, rice, corn, millet, spring wheat, etc.) to achieve reasonable close planting, and mobilize the masses to establish small experimental fields in units of households, groups, and cooperatives to carry out experiments on various cultivation methods.
    In order to complete the above tasks and quickly promote the spring plowing work, all provinces and cities should immediately convene special meetings to make specific arrangements, and immediately issue instructions, send capable cadres to the countryside, check the preparation of spring plowing work, and continuously conduct broadcasts and reports on newspapers and radio stations to attract high attention from all localities.

    华北行政委员会发布
    加强春耕领导保证适时播种的指示
    目前春耕季节已到。迅速作好春耕工作的各项准备，保证适时播种，对完成和超过一九五三年农业增产的重大任务是具有特别重要意义的。为此：
    一、必须把农业生产当作农村中压倒一切的中心任务。任何忽视和放松农业生产的领导都会遭致不可弥补的损失。各级领导同志，特别是专区、县级以下的领导同志，必须把主要精力放在农业生产上，固定专人负责，并指定专门机构和专职人员进行日常工作，组织干部下乡检查，迅速建立技术指导站，以加强春耕运动的领导和技术指导。
    二、结合农村订计划运动，全面开展爱国丰产竞赛运动。各地要加强对农民的政治思想教育，以农业生产合作社、互助组、国营农场为单位，订立爱国丰产竞赛计划，并以劳动模范带头，发动广大农民，开展全面的爱国丰产竞赛运动，以发掘农业生产的潜在能力，为达到大片丰产和全面增产的目标而奋斗。
    三、加强防旱抗旱工作，克服盲目乐观情绪。积极发动群众耙耱保墒，开发小型水利，提早春汇，实行合理经济用水，做好防旱抗旱准备工作，以保证适时播种。
    四、保证完成粮食的播种计划；棉田面积既不准扩大，也不准缩小。如当地棉田面积过于集中，应适当加以调剂，一般可控制在总面积百分之五十以下，以便调茬轮种。在春耕播种期间，必须抓紧对群众的技术指导，及早警惕并防止病虫灾害，保证各种作物全苗。特别要把密植作为中心，大力加以推广，争取主要作物（如棉花、水稻、玉米、谷子、春麦等）百分之四十达到合理密植，并发动群众以户、组、社为单位建立小型试验地，进行各种耕作方法的试验。
    为了完成以上任务，迅速把春耕工作推动起来，各省市应即召开专门会议，作出具体部署，并立即发出指示，派得力干部下乡，检查春耕工作准备情况，在报纸和广播电台上，连续进行广播和报道，以引起各地的高度注意。
