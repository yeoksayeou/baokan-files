    Beijing Library, major bookstores, and cinemas throughout the city were crowded with audiences and readers on the 10th, as they admired and read pictures, films, and surviving genius works of Stalin, the great teacher of the people of the world. The Beijing Library began holding a book and picture exhibition in mourning of Comrade Stalin on the 8th. The exhibition displayed nearly 100 kinds of Stalin's works in Russian and Chinese versions. Pictures about Stalin's life and deeds and Beijing people's condolences on Comrade Stalin's death were also exhibited. Thousands of workers, students, and residents quietly perused Stalin's works in a continuous stream in the exhibition hall, gaining truth and encouragement from them, preparing to work better for the motherland and the people of the world. Fifteen cinemas throughout the city began screening films about Stalin's life and deeds on the 10th, including "The Vow," "The Unforgettable Year 1919," and "The Defence of Tsaritsyn." The cinemas were crowded. People paid their respects and once again admired Stalin's great image on the screen, learning from his lifelong tenacious and unyielding revolutionary fighting spirit. The cinemas also screened the newsreel special "Mourning Our Most Beloved Teacher, the Great Comrade Stalin," which recorded various scenes of people from all walks of life in Beijing deeply mourning Stalin's death. On the 10th, the number of people going to bookstores to buy Stalin's works and portraits of Stalin was still very crowded. Many kinds of Stalin's works in various bookstores have been sold out. The People's Publishing House is now working day and night to rush-print "A Brief Biography of Stalin" and various works by Stalin. The People's Fine Arts Publishing House is compiling and drawing pictures of Stalin's life and career and portraits of Stalin, preparing to publish them in large quantities.
