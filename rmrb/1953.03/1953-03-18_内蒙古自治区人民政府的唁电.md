To the Presidium of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic:

    In these days of immense sorrow over the passing of Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, we were shocked to learn of the unfortunate passing of President Klement Gottwald, the great leader of the Czechoslovak people and an outstanding fighter for the cause of world peace and democracy. We extend our deepest condolences on behalf of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, the people of all ethnic groups and circles of the Autonomous Region, and myself. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the people of all ethnic groups and circles in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will, together with the people of the whole country, unite even more closely with the Czechoslovak people and fight to the end for the consolidation and development of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!

      Ulanhu, Chairman of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China
                              March 15, 1953
