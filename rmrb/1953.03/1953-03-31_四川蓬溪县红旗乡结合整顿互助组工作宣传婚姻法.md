    Sichuan Province, Pengxi County, Hongqi Township combined the rectification of mutual aid teams with the promotion of the Marriage Law in February this year, dispelling the masses' ideological concerns, raising the awareness and production enthusiasm of the masses (especially women), and smoothly resolving various problems in the mutual aid teams.
    The work of rectifying mutual aid teams in Hongqi Township was carried out in three steps. The first step was to understand the problems existing in the mutual aid teams, the masses' concerns about implementing the Marriage Law, and to publicize the three major principles of mutual aid teams and the Marriage Law. The second step was to convene a representative meeting of the township's mutual aid teams to introduce experiences, provide key assistance, and mediate marriage issues that the masses requested to be resolved. The third step was to convene a township people's representative meeting (with all mutual aid team leaders participating) to summarize the rectification of mutual aid teams, adopt patriotic production increase plans, and launch production increase competitions between villages, teams, and households. At the meeting, model families, model couples, and model parents-in-law were commended, and the masses were called upon to learn from them.
    When the work team first arrived in the township, they found that the mutual aid teams generally had problems such as a lack of democracy, unequal value, disputes over cattle feeding, uncompensated use of agricultural tools, and unequal pay for equal work between men and women, as well as violations of the Marriage Law such as beating women, interfering with freedom of marriage, and preventing women from attending meetings. All of these restricted the labor enthusiasm of some men and women and affected production. At the beginning of the rectification of the mutual aid teams, some cadres and members of the mutual aid teams were not in high spirits, and did not speak at meetings. In particular, those who had beaten their wives or interfered with others' freedom of marriage were very uneasy because they heard that a campaign to implement the Marriage Law would be launched in March and were afraid of being struggled against.
    In response to these situations, the work team first carried out extensive publicity among the masses in accordance with the publicity outline for the implementation of the Marriage Law promulgated by the Central Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law and the three major principles of mutual aid teams, so that the policy met with the masses to dispel their concerns. At the same time, starting from the inspection of the production of the mutual aid teams, they summarized the achievements, affirmed the achievements and experiences in increasing production last year, and democratically formulated production increase plans. Then, they inspected the problems existing in the teams, inspired the members to find the reasons, and made them consciously realize the importance of implementing the principles of voluntary mutual benefit for consolidating and improving the mutual aid teams, and that doing a good job in family relations was the prerequisite for completing the production increase plan, as well as the impact of the feudal marriage system, oppression, and abuse of women on production. In this way, male and female team members could consciously and actively expose the problems existing in the teams, review shortcomings, promote democracy, and reasonably solve the existing problems. For example, Zhong Ping'an (village militia captain), a member of a mutual aid team, used to abuse his wife frequently. His wife couldn't bear the abuse, so she was negative in production and did not participate in mutual aid team labor. After publicity and education, Zhong Ping'an realized his mistakes and automatically proposed to ensure good family relations. His wife was very happy, also joined the mutual aid team, and actively exposed and solved the problems existing in the mutual aid team.
    While solving the problems within the mutual aid teams, the method of "starting from both ends" was adopted to concretize the publicity of the Marriage Law through the solution of practical problems among the masses. That is, on the one hand, find model couples and model parents-in-law in and out of the team who are harmonious and united in doing a good job in production, commend their production achievements and introduce their production increase plans, and call on the masses to learn from them; on the other hand, enlighten and educate some people who have disharmonious families and hinder production, and mediate those who request mediation, so that they become harmonious, united, democratic, and happy new families and make family production increase plans. In this way, the work of rectifying the mutual aid teams has been carried out extremely rapidly, and it has provided a strong guarantee for the full realization of the production increase plan of the mutual aid teams.
    After eight days of work, 80% of the men and women in the township directly or indirectly received publicity and education on the Marriage Law, model couples and model families were commended, and the production enthusiasm of the masses was generally improved. The democratic atmosphere within the mutual aid teams increased, and the team members who used to be autocratic and monopolized by the team leader now all spoke out and established a democratic management system. On the issue of equal value, the original unreasonable scoring method was also improved, and the principle that the wage rate for busy agricultural work is equal to the market price was determined. The principle of equal pay for equal work between men and women has generally been implemented. Other issues related to draught cattle and agricultural tools have also been reasonably resolved. The whole township has generally formulated the patriotic production increase plan for 1953.

    四川蓬溪县红旗乡结合整顿互助组工作宣传婚姻法
    四川省蓬溪县红旗乡在今年二月间整顿互助组时，结合宣传婚姻法，解除了群众的思想顾虑，提高了群众（特别是妇女）的觉悟和生产积极性，互助组中的各种问题也顺利得到解决。
    红旗乡整顿互助组的工作分三步进行。第一步是了解互助组中所存在的问题，群众对贯彻婚姻法的顾虑，及宣传互助组三大原则和婚姻法。第二步是召开乡的互助组代表会，在会上介绍经验，进行重点帮助，同时，并调处群众要求调解的婚姻问题。第三步召开乡人民代表会（互助组长全部参加），总结整顿互助组情况，通过订爱国增产计划，掀起村、组、户之间的增产竞赛。会上，同时表扬模范家庭、模范夫妇、模范公婆，号召群众向他们学习。
    工作组初到该乡时，发现该乡互助组中普遍存在不民主、不等价、耕牛饲养纠纷、农具无偿使用、男女同工不同酬等问题，及违反婚姻法如打骂妇女、干涉婚姻自由、阻止妇女参加会议等现象。这些，都限制了部分男女群众的劳动积极性，影响了生产。整顿互助组开始时，部分干部和互助组组员情绪不高，开会也不发言。特别是打过老婆或干涉过别人婚姻自由的人，听说三月份要展开贯彻婚姻法运动，怕挨斗争，都非常不安。
    针对这些情况，工作组首先依照中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会公布的贯彻婚姻法宣传提纲和互助组的三大原则，在群众中进行广泛的宣传，使政策与群众见面，以解除群众顾虑。同时从检查互助组的生产入手，总结成绩，肯定去年增产中的成绩、经验，民主订定了增产计划。接着检查组内存在的问题，启发组员寻找原因，使他们自觉认识到贯彻自愿互利等原则对巩固提高互助组的重要性，与搞好家庭关系是完成增产计划的前提，以及封建婚姻制度、压迫、虐待妇女对生产的影响。这样，男女组员便能自觉地、积极地揭露组内存在的问题，检讨缺点，发扬民主，合理解决存在的问题。如互助组组员钟平安（村武装队长）过去经常虐待妻子，他的妻子受气不过，因而生产消极，没参加互助组劳动；经过宣传教育后，钟平安认识了自己的不是，自动提出保证搞好家庭关系，妻子非常喜欢，也参加了互助组，并积极地揭露与解决了互助组内存在的问题。
    在解决互助组内问题的同时，采取“两头下手”的办法，使婚姻法的宣传通过群众中实际问题的解决而具体化。即一面找出组内及组外和睦团结搞好生产的模范夫妇、模范公婆，表扬他们的生产成绩与介绍他们的增产计划，号召群众向他们看齐；一方面启发教育一些家庭不和、妨碍生产的人，对要求调解者即进行调解，使成为和睦团结、民主幸福的新家庭，订出家庭增产计划。这样一来，整顿互助组的工作开展极为迅速，而且给互助组增产计划的全部实现，提供了有力保证。
    经过了八天的工作，全乡百分之八十的男女直接或间接受到了婚姻法的宣传教育，表扬了模范夫妇和模范家庭，群众生产热情普遍提高了。互助组内民主空气增加了，过去组长专断、包办的，现在组员都开了腔，并订立了民主管理制度。在等价问题上，也改进了原来不合理的评分方法，确定了农忙工价等于市价的原则。一般都贯彻了男女同工同酬的原则。其他耕牛农具问题也都得到合理解决。全乡普遍订出了一九五三年的爱国增产计划。
