Telegram of Condolence from the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party:

　　At a time when we are feeling infinite grief over the passing of Comrade Stalin, we were shocked to hear of the passing of Comrade Gottwald, the leader of the Czechoslovak people and a great communist fighter, which makes us feel deep sorrow. Under the leadership of Comrade Gottwald, the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the people of the whole country have won great victories in their struggles and established a profound friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia. In the future, we will further strengthen the unity between the people of China and Czechoslovakia and strive together in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union to defend the world's people's democracy and lasting peace!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
