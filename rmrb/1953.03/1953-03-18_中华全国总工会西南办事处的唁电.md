Condolence Telegram from the Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to the Central Council of Trade Unions of Czechoslovakia:

    The unfortunate passing of Comrade Gottwald, the great leader of the Czechoslovak people and an outstanding fighter of the workers' movement, is not only a major loss for the Czechoslovak people but also a major loss for the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union! In the deep grief over the passing of Comrade Stalin, the great teacher of the working people of the world, we have been struck by new grief.
    The working class of Southwest China expresses its deepest condolences for Comrade Gottwald and vows, together with the working class of the whole country, to further strengthen the close unity with the working class of Czechoslovakia and to fight to the end for the common cause of the Chinese and Czech people.
                      Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
                                March 16, 1953
