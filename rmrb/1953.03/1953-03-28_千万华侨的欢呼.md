Cheers of Tens of Millions of Overseas Chinese
Chen Jiageng

The Central People's Government Committee passed the following resolution at its twentieth meeting on January 13th: "In accordance with Article 7, Paragraph 10 of the Organic Law of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, it is decided that in 1953, people's representative conferences at the township, county, and provincial (municipal) levels will be convened, elected by the people through universal suffrage. On this basis, the National People's Congress will then be convened. At this National People's Congress, the constitution will be formulated, the outline of the national five-year construction plan will be approved, and a new Central People's Government will be elected."

This historic and great decision was made based on the suggestion of the Chinese Communist Party. In order to implement Article 12 of the Common Program: "The state power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise state power are the people's representative conferences and people's governments at all levels. People's representative conferences at all levels shall be elected by the people through universal suffrage." On December 24th of last year, Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, representing the CPC Central Committee, put forward this proposal to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In order to consolidate the people's regime, implement the national democratic system, and meet the requirements of large-scale national construction, it is very necessary, timely, and correct for the Central People's Government to make this decision. This matter once again demonstrates the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government's adherence to the law and keeping their promises.

This decision immediately received warm cheers and support from all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations across the country. This situation has already been reflected in the newspapers. More than ten million overseas Chinese will have the right to elect and be elected in this general election, just like the people in the country. There is no doubt that their enthusiasm for cheering and supporting will not be less than that of the people in the country.

Judging from the reaction of overseas Chinese to domestic election-related events in the past, it is very clear what kind of enthusiastic feelings this universal suffrage event will cause among overseas Chinese. In the early years of the Republic of China, there was a so-called National Assembly in the country, but overseas Chinese had no representatives. In Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will, there is the phrase "recently advocated convening a National Convention." Earlier, in the "Outline of National Reconstruction," he clearly stipulated the steps of the revolutionary strategy, from military administration, tutelage administration, to constitutional administration. Overseas Chinese very much hoped that the Kuomintang government would implement Mr. Zhongshan's last wishes as soon as possible, end "tutelage administration," and implement constitutional administration. Therefore, they always paid great attention to the convening of the National Convention or National Assembly. However, the Kuomintang reactionary government delayed it again and again. It was not until 1936 that it promulgated a draft constitution and issued the National Assembly Organization Law and Election Law. However, the spirit and content of this draft constitution, National Assembly Organization Law, and Election Law also violated the wishes of overseas Chinese. As for the so-called "election" of overseas Chinese National Assembly representatives, it was carried out by a small number of Kuomintang members. When the "Lugouqiao Incident" broke out, the so-called National Assembly was stillborn. On the eve of his demise, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang staged an ugly farce of a pseudo-National Assembly electing a pseudo-president. Overseas Chinese mostly disdained to pay attention to Chiang's shamelessness. Therefore, those who went to Nanjing to act as pseudo-representatives were all appointed by the Kuomintang reactionary government and had nothing to do with the vast number of overseas Chinese. This time, the Central People's Government decided to convene a universally elected National People's Congress, enabling the people to further become the masters of the country, achieving true democracy, fully in line with the requirements of the Chinese people, and at the same time realizing the wishes of overseas Chinese for decades.

For decades, overseas Chinese compatriots have dreamed of a prosperous and strong motherland, a motherland that realizes true democratic politics. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the dream has become a reality. Our country has achieved great achievements in just three years that have never been seen in history and will convene the People's Congress on this victorious basis. Overseas Chinese fully understand how these achievements and decisions came about and what valuable significance they have!

I believe that 11 million overseas Chinese compatriots warmly support this decision, and I believe that in order to cherish the sacred rights given by the motherland, they will be able to carefully elect their representatives in an appropriate manner and method. (Xinhua News Agency)

    千万华侨的欢呼
    陈嘉庚
    中央人民政府委员会于一月十三日第二十次会议上通过了：“根据中华人民共和国中央人民政府组织法第七条第十款的规定，决议于一九五三年召开由人民用普选方法产生的乡、县、省（市）各级人民代表大会，并在此基础上接着召开全国人民代表大会。在这次全国人民代表大会上，将制定宪法，批准国家五年建设计划纲要和选举新的中央人民政府。”
    这个历史性的伟大决定，是根据中国共产党的建议做出来的。中国共产党为了实现共同纲领第十二条：“中华人民共和国的国家政权属于人民。人民行使国家政权的机关为各级人民代表大会和各级人民政府。各级人民代表大会由人民用普选方法产生之。”在去年十二月二十四日由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会周恩来副主席代表中共中央向中国人民政治协商会议提出了这个建议。为了巩固人民政权，实行国家民主制度，适应国家大规模建设的要求，中央人民政府做出这个决定，是很必要、很适时、很正确的。这件事又一次表现了中国共产党和中央人民政府的守法守信。
    这个决定，立即取得全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的热烈欢呼和拥护。这种情况已在报纸上反应出来。海外千余万华侨在这次普选中和国内人民一样获得选举权和被选举权，毫无疑义，其欢呼与拥护的热情不会减于国内人民。
    我从国外华侨历来对国内有关选举事件的反应情况来看，很明白，这次普选事件会在华侨中引起怎样热烈的心情。民国初年，国内有所谓国会，而华侨并没有议员。孙中山先生遗嘱中有“最近主张开国民会议”一语，较早时候，他在“建国大纲”中明定了革命方略的步骤，由军政、训政、而入于宪政，华侨很希望国民党政府早日实行中山先生的遗训，结束“训政”，实行宪政。因此对于召开国民会议或国民大会，时时寄予很大的注意，而国民党反动政府，竟一延再延，至一九三六年才公布宪法草案，颁布国民大会组织法与选举法，而这个宪法草案，国民大会组织法和选举法的精神与内容也是违背华侨的愿望的；至于所谓华侨国大代表的“选举”，则由少数国民党人包办进行。到了“芦沟桥事变”爆发，所谓国民大会就流产了。蒋介石匪帮在他灭亡的前夕，扮演了一幕伪国大选伪总统的丑剧，国外华侨以蒋之无耻，多不屑加以注意。因此，那些到南京充当伪代表的，都由国民党反动政府指派，和广大华侨是没有关系的。这次中央人民政府决定召开普选的全国人民代表大会，使人民进一步做国家的主人，达到真正的民主，完全符合中国人民的要求，同时实现华侨数十年来的愿望。
    国外侨胞，数十年来梦想一个富强的祖国，一个实现真正民主政治的祖国，现在，在毛主席领导下，梦想成为现实了，我们的国家在短短三年中获得了历史上从来没有过的伟大成就，并将在这胜利基础上召开人民代表大会，华侨完全懂得，这种成就和决策是怎样来的，具有怎样宝贵的意义！
    我相信国外一千一百万侨胞都热烈拥护这个决定，并相信他们为珍视祖国所给予的神圣的权利，必能以适当方式和方法，慎重地选举其代表。（新华社）
