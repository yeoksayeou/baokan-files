    Hubei and Hunan Provinces
    Launch Spring Afforestation Campaign
    Hubei and Hunan provinces have launched a spring afforestation and forestry cultivation campaign. Currently, in Hunan Province, the five counties of Lingling and Daoxian alone have planted more than 17.2 million pine, fir, and tung trees. Lingling County, which has made faster progress, has planted more than 7 million trees on barren mountains and more than 200 li of trees along rivers and ditches. More than 20 counties in Hubei Province, including Huanggang and Wuchang, have established afforestation committees. In Wuchang County's Seventh District, more than 7,000 farmers are mobilized to plant trees every day. Currently, the entire district has afforested 9,000 mu and planted more than 4 million trees.
    In the afforestation movement, both Hubei and Hunan provinces have paid attention to providing technical guidance to farmers on tree planting. The Xiangnan Administrative Office of Hunan Province has established tree planting and afforestation stations in afforestation areas such as Hengshan, Guidong, Linwu, and Jianghua, and has held forestry training classes in 20 counties throughout the area. In Hubei Province, two working teams dispatched by the Central South Forestry Administration and nine afforestation working groups organized by the Hubei Provincial Forestry Bureau are assisting and guiding farmers in afforestation in various regions.

    湖北、湖南两省
    展开春季造林运动
    湖北、湖南两省展开春季造林育林运动。目前湖南省仅零陵、道县等五县，已栽植松树、杉树、桐树一千七百二十多万株；进度较快的零陵县，除在荒山植树七百多万株外，在沿河、沿沟又植树二百多里。湖北省黄冈、武昌等二十多个县都已建立造林委员会；武昌县第七区动员起来种树的农民每天有七千多人，现全区已造林九千亩，植树四百多万株。
    湖北、湖南两省在造林运动中，都注意对农民植树的技术指导。湖南省湘南行署分别在衡山、桂东、临武、江华等造林区设立了植树造林站，并在全区二十个县举办了林业训练班。在湖北省，有中南林业总局派出的两个工作队和湖北省林业局组织的九个造林工作组，协助和指导各地农民造林。   （新华社）
