    Huai River Commission Takes Measures to Strengthen Equipment Management
    Letter from the Huai River Commission: The criticisms made by readers in the People's Daily on February 1st and February 20th regarding the stockpiling and waste of equipment in the Huai River project are correct. The Huai River Commission is currently addressing this issue in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, in order to educate all staff members and combat phenomena that violate the equipment system.

    Regarding the incident in Zhumadian where three hundred wheelbarrows were stored unattended, we have instructed the Henan Huai River General Headquarters to handle it promptly. Concerning the incidents of burying wheelbarrows and steel rails in the Xiacaowan Canal Diversion Project, using wheelbarrows as water tanks at the Chongtong River construction site, and laborers using sleepers as springboards at the Laolongtan construction site, after sending personnel to inspect, in addition to recovering the wheelbarrows and sleepers, the relevant personnel have made self-criticisms. Regarding the large amount of cement stockpiled upstream of the Huai River, the Henan Huai River General Headquarters has been inspecting it while requesting the Huai River Commission to handle it promptly. We have taken various measures to minimize losses. However, the handling of these specific issues does not equate to the end of the stockpiling and waste of equipment. In the two years of the Huai River project, the lack of a highly centralized procurement, allocation, and storage system for equipment management is the main reason for the disorganization of equipment, and the idea of "valuing finances and grain, but undervaluing equipment" is the root cause of these shortcomings. To this end, the Huai River Commission has decided to take the following measures: (1) Conduct a thorough and serious inventory and asset verification to establish a strict material accounting system; (2) Use various meetings to expose the criminal acts of stockpiling and wasting equipment, and seriously deal with incidents that violate the equipment system; (3) Assign strong cadres to strengthen the work of the equipment management department, and organize training in batches to improve their professional level; (4) Implement a unified procurement, allocation, and storage system for equipment, and resolutely eliminate small warehouses; (5) Strengthen reporting and regularly organize inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections.

### 治淮委员会作出关于加强器材管理措施

    治淮委员会作出关于加强器材管理措施
    治淮委员会来信：二月一日和二月二十日人民日报所载读者对治淮工程中积压浪费器材的批评是正确的。治淮委员会正结合反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的斗争进行处理，以教育全体工作人员和违反器材制度的现象作斗争。
    驻马店存放三百辆斗车无人看管事件，我们已责成河南治淮总指挥部迅速处理；下草湾引河工程中埋没斗车钢轨事件、漴潼河工地斗车被当作水缸用和老龙潭工地民工以枕木做跳板事件，经派员检查，除将斗车和枕木收回外，有关人员已作检讨；淮河上游积压大批水泥，河南治淮总指挥部已一面检查，一面请求治淮委员会迅速处理。我们已作各种措施，力争减少损失。但是，这些具体问题的处理并不等于积压、浪费器材现象的终结。两年多的治淮工程中，器材管理工作缺乏高度集中的采购、调拨、保管制度，是造成器材零乱的主要原因，而“重财粮、轻器材”则是造成这些缺点的思想根蒂。为此，治淮委员会决定采取如下措施：（一）普遍地认真地进行清仓核资工作，建立严密的料账制度；（二）利用各种会议揭露积压、浪费器材的犯罪行为，严肃处理破坏器材制度的事件；（三）增派坚强干部充实器材管理部门的工作，并分批集训以提高业务水平；（四）实行器材的统一采购、调拨保管制度，坚决消灭小仓库；（五）加强表报，经常组织检查组深入检查。
