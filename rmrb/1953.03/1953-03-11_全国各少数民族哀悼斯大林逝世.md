    National minorities across the country mourned the death of Stalin, the great teacher of all ethnic peoples of the world. They all firmly expressed their determination to study Stalin's profound theories on the national question and the path he pointed out, and to learn from the example of the consolidated unity and fraternity of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union.
    From the grasslands of Inner Mongolia to the Kangzang Plateau, from Xinjiang bordering the Soviet Union to the borders of Yunnan and all parts of the country, the people of all ethnic minorities felt extremely grieved by Stalin's death. All ethnic groups also held mourning ceremonies in accordance with their own customs.
    From the national equality they have gained, from the restoration of their ethnic economic and cultural undertakings, and from the happy lives they have personally experienced, the people of all ethnic minorities deeply realize that their happy lives are inseparable from the generous and selfless assistance of the Soviet people. Qin Yingji (Zhuang nationality), Chairman of the People's Government of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in Guangxi Province, said: I joined the revolutionary work when I was in my teens, and Stalin's name is deeply imprinted in my heart. Stalin is strength and victory. The Zhuang Autonomous Region was established under the guidance of Stalin's theory of national issues and the implementation of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies. Lin Ziqing, Deputy County Chief of the Yi Autonomous Region People's Government in Eshan County, Yunnan Province, said: If it were not for the guidance of Stalin's revolutionary theory and the care and assistance of the Soviet people to the Chinese revolution, how could our ethnic minorities have what they have today. Zhao Cunxin, Chairman of the People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, which was established not long ago, said: Stalin will always live in the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna.
    While deeply mourning, the people of all ethnic minorities across the country also expressed their determination to turn grief into strength, study Stalin's theories on national issues, follow the path he pointed out, further consolidate national unity, and strive to build a large family of unity and fraternity among all ethnic groups. Young students of all ethnic groups studying at national colleges and ethnic cadre schools in various places have all made plans to study Stalin's theory on national issues. Many students also wrote letters of determination to study. Bailao, an Aini student from Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan, said: "Stalin will always live in our hearts. We must learn the principles he left behind and build a better home." Jin Shilong, a national model agricultural producer from the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region in Jilin Province who had visited the Soviet Union, said: "In the future, we must study the advanced experience of Soviet agricultural production even harder and grow crops better. Produce more grain, support the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front to win more victories, and defend world peace." The Mongolian and Hui people of the Alxa League Autonomous Region in Ningxia Province, and Miao model producers Pan Zhifa and Zhang Yongkang in Guizhou Province, all expressed their determination to improve animal husbandry production and develop agricultural production to improve the lives of all ethnic groups. The people of all ethnic groups in Baoshan Prefecture and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, who live on the border of the motherland in the southwest, solemnly swore to Stalin's portrait at the memorial service: All ethnic groups must unite more closely, work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in building national defense, build the border areas, and consolidate the national defense of the motherland.

    全国各少数民族哀悼斯大林逝世
    据新华社讯：全国各少数民族人民在无限悲恸中，哀悼了世界各民族人民的伟大导师斯大林。他们都坚决表示要学习斯大林关于民族问题的精湛学说和他所指示的道路，学习苏联各民族巩固的团结友爱的榜样。
    从内蒙古草原至康藏高原，从与苏联接邻的新疆至云南边疆和全国各地的各少数民族人民，都为斯大林的逝世感到万分悲痛。各族人民还依照自己的习俗，举行哀悼。
    各少数民族人民从已获得的民族平等权利中，从本民族经济、文化事业的恢复和他们亲身经历的幸福生活中，都深刻地体会到，他们的幸福生活，是与苏联人民慷慨无私的帮助分不开的。广西省桂西僮族自治区人民政府主席覃应机（僮族）说：我十几岁就参加革命工作，斯大林的名字深深印在我的心里。斯大林就是力量、就是胜利。僮族自治区就是在斯大林民族理论学说的指导下和执行了毛主席的民族政策而成立的。云南省峨山县彝族自治区人民政府的副县长林子清说：要不是斯大林革命学说的指导和苏联人民对中国革命的关怀和帮助，我们少数民族那里会有今天。刚成立不久的云南省西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府主席召存信说：斯大林永远活在西双版纳各族人民的心中。
    全国各少数民族人民在深切的悼念中，同时表示要化悲痛为力量，学习斯大林有关民族问题的理论，走他所指引的道路，进一步巩固民族团结，为建设各民族团结友爱的大家庭而奋斗。在各地民族学院和民族干部学校学习的各族青年学员，都订出学习斯大林的民族理论的计划。许多学员还写下了学习决心书。云南西双版纳傣族自治区爱尼族学员百劳说：“斯大林永远活在我们的心中，我们要学习他留下的道理，建设更好的家园。”曾经访问过苏联的吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区全国农业生产模范金时龙说：“我们今后更要好好学习苏联农业生产的先进经验，把庄稼种的更好。多打粮食，支援在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军多打胜仗，保卫世界和平。”宁夏省阿拉善旗自治区的蒙、回族人民，贵州省苗族生产模范潘治发、张永康等，都表示要改善畜牧生产和发展农业生产来改善各族人民的生活。住在祖国西南边疆国境线上的云南保山专区、西双版纳傣族自治区的各族人民，在追悼会上，向着斯大林遗像庄严地宣誓：各族人民要更加紧密团结，努力学习苏联建设国防的先进经验，来建设边疆、巩固祖国的国防。
