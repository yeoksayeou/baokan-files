Jing Changwen and Jiang Pei, designers at the Design Department of the Northeast Electrical Engineering Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, implemented economic accounting principles in a boiler project design, saving the state 4 billion yuan.

Last autumn, the Design Department of the Northeast Electrical Engineering Bureau began designing a large high-pressure boiler room for a certain factory. During the preliminary design phase, it was decided to use eight 10-ton water tube boilers. Comrade Jing Changwen, who was responsible for the design of this project at the time, felt that arranging the eight boilers in a row would make the boiler room too long and had shortcomings from both a logical and practical standpoint. He considered this design unreasonable and sought ways to improve it.

At the end of last December, Jing Changwen met an engineer from a boiler factory. In the conversation, he learned that our boiler factories were now capable of manufacturing 18-ton water tube boilers. He was very pleased and, upon returning to the design department, suggested to everyone that, without affecting the on-time delivery, two 18-ton boilers be used to replace four 10-ton boilers. Comrade Jiang Pei, who was co-designing the project, immediately agreed and cooperated with Comrade Jing Changwen in collecting design data. After the two of them carefully calculated the costs, they found that using two 18-ton boilers instead of four 10-ton boilers would save 2.8 billion yuan in equipment costs alone, and another 1.2 billion yuan in transportation, materials, and installation costs. The money saved accounted for more than 11 percent of the total boiler room investment. After the project is completed, because the number of units is reduced, two fewer stokers will be needed per shift, saving a total of six workers over three shifts. As a result, this suggestion was immediately adopted, and the original design was changed.

    在设计中贯彻经济核算思想
    为国家节省了四十亿元的资金
    第一机械工业部东北电工局设计处设计人员经昌文和蒋霈，在一项锅炉工程设计中贯彻了经济核算思想，给国家节省了四十亿元。
    去年秋天，东北电工局设计处开始给某厂设计一个大型的高压锅炉房，在进行初步设计的时候，决定采用八台十吨的水管锅炉。当时负责这项工程设计的经昌文同志，感觉到把八台锅炉排成一行，锅炉房太长，从道理上和使用上来看都有缺点。他认为这项设计不合理，于是就想办法改进它。
    去年十二月底，有一天经昌文遇到了锅炉制造厂的工程师，在交谈中他了解到目前我们锅炉厂能够制造十八吨的水管锅炉了。他非常高兴，回到设计处就向大家提出建议：在不影响按期交货的原则下，用两台十八吨锅炉代替四台十吨锅炉。共同设计这项工程的蒋霈同志立刻赞同，并配合经昌文同志搜集设计资料。经他们两人算细帐的结果，用两台十八吨锅炉代替四台十吨锅炉，光在设备费上就可节省二十八亿元，在运输、材料、安装费用上又可节省十二亿元。这项所节省的钱，占全部锅炉房投资的百分之十一强。将来工程竣工后，因为台数减少了，每班可以减少两个烧火的人工，三班共可减少六个人工。因此，这个建议立刻被采纳，改变了原来的设计。
