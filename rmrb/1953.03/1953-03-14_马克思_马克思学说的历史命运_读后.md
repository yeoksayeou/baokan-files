    Reading Marx's "The Historical Destiny of the Doctrine of Marx"
    Wang Nan

    On March 14, 1913 (March 1st according to the Russian calendar), Lenin published the article "The Historical Destiny of the Doctrine of Marx" to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Marx's death. Today marks the 70th anniversary of Marx's death and the 40th anniversary of the publication of Lenin's article.

    Since the publication of the "Communist Manifesto" in 1848, the history of the past hundred years has been the history of the victory of Marxism. History has proven that no reactionary class force in the world can stop Marxism from achieving victory. This was the case in the past, it is the case now, and it will be the case in the future.

    Lenin pointed out in the conclusion of his article: "Since the emergence of Marxism, each of the three major eras in world history has given it new confirmation and new victory. But the historical era that is about to come will surely make Marxism, this doctrine of the proletariat, achieve even greater victory."

    This conclusion not only provides a comprehensive summary of past history but also presents a scientific prediction of future historical development. This prediction has now been confirmed by a series of historical events, from the victory of the October Socialist Revolution to the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, and the "historical era that is about to come" will continue to confirm its eternal victory.

    From the publication of the "Communist Manifesto" in 1848 to the time Lenin wrote this article in 1913, the three main periods of world history Lenin referred to were as follows: The first period was from the February Revolution in France and the March Revolution in Germany in 1848 to the Paris Commune (1871). This period was the victory of Marxism over the diverse socialist factions before Marxism. During this period, the Paris Commune demonstrated the heroism of the proletariat and ultimately ended the development process of bourgeois reforms in Europe. This period saw the birth of proletarian parties and their own international organizations.

    The second period was from the year after the Paris Commune (1872) to the eve of the Russian Revolution (1904). At this time, the bourgeois revolution period in the West had ended, while the East had not yet matured to realize such a revolution. This was a stage for the European proletariat to accumulate strength and prepare for battle, and a period of widespread dissemination of Marxist doctrine. The theoretical victory of Marxism reached such a degree that its enemies were forced to put on a set of Marxist clothes.

    The third period began with the Russian Revolution of 1905. At this time, the so-called "peaceful" period from 1872 to 1904 had passed forever. The "social peace" in Europe was like a barrel of gunpowder, and even British workers began to move. "The process of disintegration of all bourgeois parties and the maturation of the proletariat is progressing straightforwardly."

    In early 1917, when discussing the Russian Revolution of 1905, Lenin pointed out "its special proletarian nature" and pointed out its world significance: "Geographically, economically, and historically, Russia belongs not only to Europe but also to Asia. Therefore, we see that the Russian revolution not only completely awakened one of the largest and most backward countries in Europe from its slumber but also cultivated revolutionary people led by the proletariat. The Russian revolution not only achieved this but also aroused revolutionary movements throughout Asia. The revolutions that occurred in Turkey, Persia, and China prove that the magnificent uprising of 1905 left a profound mark, and its influence on the development of the revolutionary movement of hundreds of millions of people is eternally indelible." (Quoted from "Report on the 1905 Revolution")

    If the first and second periods were still in the era of capitalism, then the third period, starting from 1905, precisely at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, had already entered the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.

    If the revolutionary movement in the first and second periods mainly only thrived in Europe, then in the third period, the revolutionary movement also began to move in Asia, even as Lenin said, "Europe is also moving along with Asia—but not in the Asian way." In May of this year (1913), Lenin wrote the article "Backward Europe and Advanced Asia," warmly praising young Asia, especially praising and supporting the Chinese revolutionary people. He pointed out that the reactionary bourgeois Europe was backward, and Asia was advanced instead. Forty years ago, no one in the world other than Lenin, the great Marxist teacher, could have such brilliant foresight.

    Lenin's brilliant foresight is concentrated in a great argument in "The Historical Destiny of the Doctrine of Marx." This argument is that Asia has become a new source of great world revolutionary storms. Lenin said:

    "While the opportunists are still desperately praising 'social peace' and desperately advocating that storms can be avoided under 'democratic systems,' new sources of extremely large world storms have emerged in Asia. ... We are now in an era when these storms are prevalent and 'reversely influence' Europe. No matter what the fate of the great Republic of China, which the 'civilized' jackals are gnashing their teeth and eager to devour, there is no force in the world that can restore the old feudal system in Asia, or eradicate the heroic democratic spirit of the masses of people in Asian and semi-Asian countries."

    People know that although the Chinese Revolution of 1911 (the Xinhai Revolution) failed, after the birth of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, following the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, through long and arduous struggles, the Chinese People's Revolution finally achieved victory and is now building new democracy and striving to move towards a socialist society.

    However, those "civilized" jackals who are gnashing their teeth and eager to devour have never been able to recognize that "there is no force in the world...that can eradicate the heroic democratic spirit of the masses of people in Asian and semi-Asian countries," and still attempt to continue to enslave the Asian people "safely and soundly," and still attempt to restore the old system in the new China. The final outcome of such evil and arrogant attempts can only be shameful failure.

    In the past, when capitalism was thriving, many Asian countries were backward compared to European and American capitalist countries. In the capitalist world, as Stalin said, "The backward will be beaten." Precisely for this reason, for a hundred years, Asia has become the hunting ground for European and American imperialism and Japanese imperialism. But now, after World War II, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the backward Europe that Lenin spoke of in those years is even more backward, and the bourgeoisie there is even more reactionary; while the advanced Asia that Lenin spoke of is even more advanced than in those years. In such a great new era, anyone who continues to pursue imperialist aggression policies, and looks at today's China and Asia with the outdated and moldy perspective of enslaving Asia and "conquering China," will inevitably fall completely into the errors of history.

    As everyone knows, the vicious American imperialism actually used atomic bombs and bacteriological bombs to massacre the Asian people, and after being beaten black and blue by the heroic people of China and Korea, it recently came up with the idea of "using Asians to fight Asians." Even if this method is realized, American imperialism will still only end in shameful failure. "Using Asians to fight Asians" is not a new method. For example, during the domestic revolutionary war, American imperialism strongly supported the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group to fight the Chinese people. But what was the outcome? It failed. Asian Japan was also cultivated by American imperialism to fight the Chinese people. It won the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, but by the time of the Second Sino-Japanese War since "September 18th" in 1931, Japan had fallen into the errors of the historical era. The great Stalin pointed out in 1938: "The Japanese imperialists in China have no future and cannot have any future" (quoted from "A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" Chapter Twelve, Section 1). In the same year, Chairman Mao also pointed out in his great work "On Protracted War": "Our war is not any other war, but the war between China and Japan in the 1930s of the 20th century. On the side of our enemy, first of all, it is imperialism that is about to die. It is in a regressive era. It is not the same as when Britain was in the progressive era of capitalism when it conquered India, nor is it the same as Japan during World War I twenty years ago. This war was launched on the eve of the great collapse of world imperialism, especially fascist countries, and the enemy is precisely carrying out this adventurous war of final struggle for this reason. Therefore, the result of the war will not be the destruction of China but the ruling group of Japanese imperialism. This is an unavoidable necessity." (Quoted from "On Protracted War": "Refuting the Theory of National Subjugation"). What was the final outcome of Japanese imperialism? The final outcome was to prove the correctness of Stalin's and Chairman Mao's conclusions. It failed in the war of aggression against China, plunged its own people into deep waters, and reduced Japan to a barracks for American imperialism.

    From this, it can be seen that the method of "using Asians to fight Asians" can only end in failure. Moreover, now that all the circumstances are even more unfavorable to American imperialism, what future can it have other than shameful failure?

    Following the October Socialist Revolution, the great victory of Marxism in Asia is first and foremost the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. Chairman Mao had already pointed out the world significance of this victory before the nationwide liberation of China (1947). He said: "The reason why this event is so great is also because this event occurred in the East of the world, where more than one billion people (accounting for half of humanity) are subjected to imperialist oppression. The liberation war of the Chinese people has turned from defense to offense, which cannot but arouse the joy and encouragement of these oppressed nations. At the same time, it is also an aid to the oppressed people in Europe and the Americas who are fighting." (Quoted from "The Current Situation and Our Tasks") Therefore, in addition to the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, new countries such as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have also emerged on the land of imperialist colonies, the national liberation movement in various parts of Asia has grown stronger day by day, and the peace movement in Asia and the Pacific region and the world has vigorously unfolded.

    History has proven and will continue to prove how warm and accurate Lenin's trust and assessment of the Asian people were forty years ago!

    The most fundamental reason why Marxism has such unparalleled power lies in its class nature and practicality. Marxism is the doctrine of the proletariat. Of all the classes in history, only the proletariat is the only class that can shoulder the "world historical mission of creating a socialist society," and the only class that is forever advancing. At the same time, Marxism, which has such a class nature, serves the practice of the proletariat and working people in transforming the world and serves the fundamental interests of hundreds of millions of people. Therefore, it is also the most welcomed by the masses of people. As long as Marxist theory is grasped by the masses, it will become an invincible material force.

    Marxism-Leninism must continue to develop, and its victories will continue to appear. When commemorating Marx today, the people of the whole country must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism in order to win greater victories for the Chinese people.

    马克思“马克思学说的历史命运”读后
    王南
    一九一三年三月十四日（俄历三月一日），列宁为纪念马克思逝世的三十周年，发表了“马克思学说的历史命运”一文。今天是马克思逝世的七十周年，也是列宁这一论文发表的四十周年了。
    自从一八四八年“共产党宣言”出版到今天，这一百余年来的历史，就是马克思主义胜利的历史。历史证明了：世界上没有任何反动阶级的力量能够阻挡马克思主义获得胜利。过去是这样，现在是这样，今后还是这样的。
    列宁在论文的结语里指出：“自马克思主义出现以后，全世界历史三大时代中的每一时代，都使它获得了新的证实与新的胜利。但行将到来的历史时代，定会使马克思主义这个无产阶级学说获得更大的胜利。”
    这一结语，不仅是对已往历史作了概括性的总结，而且对未来的历史发展也提出了科学的预见。这一预见现已被从十月社会主义革命的胜利到中国人民革命的胜利一连串的历史事件所证实了，而且，“行将到来的历史时代”还要继续证实它的永远获得胜利。
    从一八四八年“共产党宣言”出版，到一九一三年列宁写这篇论文的时候，列宁所说的世界历史的三个主要时期是这样的：第一个时期是从一八四八年法国的二月革命和德国的三月革命到巴黎公社
    （一八七一年）。这一时期是马克思主义对马克思主义以前的五花八门的社会主义派别的胜利。在这时期中，巴黎公社表现了无产阶级的英勇，并最终结束了欧洲资产阶级改革的发展过程。这时期诞生了无产阶级的政党和自己的国际组织。
    第二个时期是从巴黎公社的次一年（一八七二年）到俄国革命的前夕（一九○四年）。这时西方已完结了资产阶级革命时期，而东方尚未成熟到实现这种革命的地步。这是欧洲无产阶级积聚力量，准备战斗的阶段，是马克思学说广泛传播的时期。马克思主义在理论上的胜利，达到这样程度，逼得它的敌人也不得不换上一套马克思主义者的衣衫。
    第三个时期是从俄国一九○五年革命时起。这时，所谓从一八七二年到一九○四年的“和平”时期已永逝不返了。欧洲的“社会和平”活像一桶火药，连英国工人也动作起来了，“一切资产阶级政党解体与无产阶级成熟的过程，是在一往直前地进展着”。
    一九一七年初，列宁在论到俄国一九○五年革命时，曾经指出“它带有特殊意义的无产阶级性质”，并指出它的世界意义：“在地理上、经济上和历史上说来，俄罗斯不单属于欧洲、同时又属于亚洲。因此，我们看见：俄国革命不但使欧洲最大的和最落后的一个国家从大梦中完全醒觉起来了，不仅养成了受无产阶级所领导的革命民众。俄国革命不单达到了这一点，它并且在整个亚洲引起了革命的运动。在土耳其、波斯、中国发生的革命，证明一九○五年雄伟的起义遗留下深刻的痕迹，而它对于千百万兆民众革命运动发展中的影响，是永远不可磨灭的。”（引自“关于一九○五年革命的报告”）
    如果说第一个和第二个时期还处在资本主义时代，那么，从一九○五年起的第三个时期，正当十九世纪末和二十世纪初，已经走上帝国主义时代和无产阶级革命的时代了。
    如果说第一个时期和第二个时期，革命运动主要还只活跃在欧洲，那么，第三个时期革命运动在亚洲也动作起来了，甚至如列宁所说“欧洲也跟着亚洲——不过不是按照亚洲方式——动作起来了。”就在这年（一九一三年）五月，列宁写了“落后的欧洲与先进的亚洲”一文，热烈地赞扬青年的亚洲，特别是赞扬与声援中国革命的人民群众。他指出反动资产阶级的欧洲是落后了，亚洲反而是先进的了。在四十年以前，世界上除了列宁这位伟大的马克思主义导师，不能有此英明的远见。
    列宁这一英明的远见，集中于“马克思学说的历史命运”中的一个伟大论点。这个论点就是：亚洲成为世界革命大风暴的新泉源。列宁说：
    “当机会主义者还在拼命赞美‘社会和平’，拼命鼓吹说在‘民主制度’下可以避免风暴的时候，而极大的世界风暴的新泉源已在亚洲涌现出来了。……我们现在正处于这些风暴盛行及其‘反转来影响’欧洲的时代。不管那些‘文明’豺狼磨牙欲噬的伟大中华民国命运如何，但世界上决没有一种力量能在亚洲恢复旧有的农奴制度，能铲除亚洲国家和半亚洲国家里人民大众的英勇民主精神。”
    人们都知道，中国一九一一年（辛亥年）的革命虽然失败了，但到一九二一年中国共产党诞生以后，在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，遵循马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，经过长期艰苦斗争，中国人民革命终于胜利了，并正建设新民主主义，为走向社会主义社会而努力。
    可是，那些磨牙欲噬的“文明”豺狼，却一直不能认识到“世界上决没有一种力量……能铲除亚洲国家和半亚洲国家里人民大众的英勇民主精神”，还企图继续“安然无事”地奴役亚洲人民，还企图在新中国来恢复旧制度。这类邪恶狂妄的企图，其最后的结局只有可耻的失败。
    从前，当资本主义兴盛的时代，亚洲许多国家比起欧美各资本主义国家是落后的。在资本主义世界里，正如斯大林所说：“落后者是要挨打的”。正因为这个原因，一百年来亚洲成为欧美帝国主义和日本帝国主义的猎场。但是现在，当第二次世界大战以后，中华人民共和国成立以后，列宁当年所说的落后的欧洲，是更为落后了，那里的资产阶级更加反动了；而列宁所说先进的亚洲，比起当年更加先进了。在这样一个伟大的新时代，还有人继续进行帝国主义的侵略政策，拿陈腐到发霉的奴役亚洲和“征服支那”的眼光来看今天的中国和亚洲，就必然完全陷于历史的错误。
    大家知道，恶毒的美国帝国主义居然以投掷原子弹、细菌弹来残杀亚洲人民，在自己被中国和朝鲜的英勇人民打得头破血出的时候，最近又想出了
    “用亚洲人打亚洲人”的办法。纵然这一办法实现，美国帝国主义也仍然只有可耻的失败。“用亚洲人打亚洲人”这并不是什么新的办法，例如在国内革命战争时期，美国帝国主义曾大力支援蒋介石反动集团大打中国人民。但其结局呢？它失败了。亚洲的日本也曾被美国帝国主义培养起来打过中国人民，甲午之战时它是胜利了，但到一九三一年“九一八”以来的第二次中日战争，日本就陷于历史时代的错误了。伟大的斯大林在一九三八年就指出：“日本帝国主义者在中国，是没有而且也不能有什么前途的”（引自“联共（布）党史简明教程”第十二章第一节）。在同一年里，毛主席在他的伟大的著作“论持久战”里也指出：“我们的战争不是任何别的战争，乃是中日两国在二十世纪三十年代进行的战争。在我们的敌人方面，首先，它是快要死亡的帝国主义，它已处于退步时代，不但和英灭印度时期英国还处于资本主义的进步时代不相同，就是和二十年前第一次世界大战时的日本也不相同。此次战争发动于世界帝国主义首先是法西斯国家大崩溃的前夜，敌人也正是为了这一点才举行这个带最后挣扎性的冒险战争。所以，战争的结果，灭亡的不会是中国而是日本帝国主义的统治集团，这是无可逃避的必然性。”（引自“论持久战”：“驳亡国论”）。日本帝国主义最后结局是什么呢？最后的结局就是证明斯大林、毛主席论断的正确，它在侵略中国的战争中失败了，并且陷本国人民于水深火热之中，使日本沦为美国帝国主义的兵营。
    由此可见，“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的办法，只有失败的结局。何况今天一切情况都对美国帝国主义更为不利的时候，它除掉可耻的失败以外，又能有什么前途呢？
    继十月社会主义革命之后，马克思主义在亚洲的伟大胜利，首先就是中国人民革命的胜利。这一胜利的世界意义，还在中国全国解放以前（一九四七年），毛主席就已经指出了，他说：“这个事变所以带着伟大性，还因为这个事变发生在世界的东方，在这里，共有十万万以上人口（占人类的一半）遭受帝国主义的压迫，中国人民的解放战争由防御转到进攻，不能不引起这些被压迫民族的欢欣鼓舞。同时，对于正在斗争的欧洲与美洲各国的被压迫人民，也是一种援助。”（引自“目前形势和我们的任务”）因此，除了中国人民革命的伟大胜利以外，在帝国主义殖民地的土地上，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国等新国家也出现了，亚洲各地民族解放运动日益壮大起来了，亚洲和太平洋区域以及全世界的和平运动蓬勃地展开了。
    历史业已证明了而且将继续证明：列宁在四十年前对亚洲人民的信任和估计是何等的热诚和准确啊！
    马克思学说之所以具有如此无比的威力，最根本的原因在于它的阶级性与实践性。马克思学说是无产阶级的学说，在历史上所有阶级里，只有无产阶级是唯一能负起“为社会主义社会创造者的全世界历史使命”的阶级，唯一永远前进的阶级。同时，具有这样阶级性的马克思学说，是服务于无产阶级与劳动人民改造世界的实践的，是为千百万人民的根本利益服务的。因此，也是最为人民群众所欢迎的。只要马克思主义理论一旦为群众掌握，它就会成为不可战胜的物质力量。
    马克思列宁主义是要继续发展的，它的胜利也将不断地出现。全国人民在今天来纪念马克思的时候，必须加强马克思列宁主义的学习，以争取中国人民的更大胜利。
