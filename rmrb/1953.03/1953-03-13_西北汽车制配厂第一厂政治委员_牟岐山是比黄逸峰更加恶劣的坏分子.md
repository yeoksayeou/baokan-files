Mu Qishan, Political Commissar and Party Committee Secretary of the First Factory of the Northwest Military Region Logistics Office Automobile Parts Manufacturing Plant, treated employees with a reactionary style, colluding with bad people, attacking good people, detaining the masses, suppressing criticism, and resisting inspections. The masses believe he is a bad element even worse than Huang Yifeng.

In order to establish personal dictatorial rule in the First Factory of the Automobile Parts Manufacturing Plant, Mu Qishan used reactionary terrorist methods, arbitrarily arresting, detaining, struggling against, punishing, suspending work for self-criticism, demoting, deducting salaries, and expelling from the factory, replacing the factory's democratic management. In the past three years (excluding the "Three-Anti" Movement), 212 employees in the factory were punished 344 times, accounting for 36% of the total number of employees, resulting in a loss of 16,240 work hours. Many of these people (especially staff members) were punished for criticizing Mu Qishan's leadership style, which Mu Qishan labeled as "anti-leadership" and "anti-organization." Pan Qun, the factory's cultural and recreational cadre, had some ideological problems, and the masses had many opinions about him, but Mu Qishan valued him highly and personally introduced him to the Party. However, when Pan Qun slightly expressed dissatisfaction to other comrades about Mu Qishan's immoral behavior with women, Mu Qishan believed that it violated his "dignity" and immediately illegally detained Pan Qun, announced his expulsion from the Party, and even illegally handcuffed him in the Party Committee meeting room. After Pan Qun was framed by Mu Qishan, the factory's employees were extremely dissatisfied, and Mu Qishan smeared these people as "disloyal," "lax in discipline," and engaging in "treacherous behavior." He then ordered two cadres to suspend work for self-criticism under the pretext of "eliminating Pan Qun's ideas" and expelled two students from the factory. When Yang Tinghua, a correspondent in the factory, was napping, Mu Qishan's child ran over and made noise. Yang impatiently hit him once, and Mu Qishan wrote a letter to the factory's security section "to protect human rights" and personally illegally detained Yang Tinghua. He Shanting, a dispensing pharmacist at the factory's clinic, had a disagreement with Mu Qishan at a group meeting, and Mu believed that He was intentionally harming the "political commissar's status," slammed the table, and detained He. In May of last year, during the re-election of the factory's trade union, Mu Qishan believed that Mo Ping, the factory's organizational cadre, should be a candidate. At that time, Zhao Sheng, the factory's assistant engineer, pointed out that Mo Ping was of poor character and the masses had many opinions about him, so he should not be listed as a trade union candidate. Mu Qishan then accused Zhao Sheng of "disrupting the trade union election," held a meeting in the factory to struggle against him, and later confined Zhao for sixteen days for self-criticism. In addition to the above-mentioned illegal acts of infringing upon human rights, what is even more serious is that all employees who were suspended for self-criticism and punished by him were not paid wages, forcing workers to admit their "mistakes." Because Mu Qishan treated the working class with the means of a reactionary ruler, he seriously affected the workers' production enthusiasm. As a result, the production of the First Factory of the Automobile Parts Manufacturing Plant in 1952 decreased by 13% compared to 1951, and production efficiency decreased by 25%.

Mu Qishan's "I am the only one who is right" rule was manifested in his treatment of all cadres in the factory, completely adopting the extremely reactionary means of "those who obey me survive, those who oppose me perish." The factory director, Liu Shaopeng, used to have a lower position than him, but now that he is the factory director, he is very dissatisfied and intentionally arranged for his "capable cadres" Mo Ping, Yang Zhengxi, Song Zhaolu, and Gu Jiahua to create dissatisfaction with Liu among the employees. At the same time, he used various opportunities to incite the masses to attack Liu Shaopeng and openly said at mass meetings: "Liu Shaopeng is just a vegetable stall owner, how can he run such a big factory!" Wei Shaoying, the head of the factory's security section, had reported his illegal and undisciplined behavior to the Northwest Military Region Logistics Office. Mu Qishan believed that this was "an unhealthy trend" and "factional activity," and declared at an enlarged meeting of the branch committee: "I would rather let go of embezzlers of three million than let go of Wei Shaoying's thoughts." Mu Qishan believed that the trade union chairman, Mo Ping, and the branch secretary, Yang Zhengxi, were his "most capable cadres." In fact, Mo Ping was a person of extremely bad character, who embezzled public funds before the "Three-Anti" Movement, and did not confess during the "Three-Anti" Movement. He was also engaged in illicit relationships within the factory, while Yang Zhengxi was a beastly and lewd fellow who broke into the dormitory of female students at night and attempted to rape the family members of workers, which caused extreme dissatisfaction among the masses. However, Mu Qishan forcibly ordered the masses to evaluate Yang as a "model of political education work." During the "Three-Anti" Movement, employees reported that Mo Ping had embezzled, and Mu Qishan repeatedly defended him, saying at a mass meeting: "Mo Ping is a cadre whom the Party Committee values and cultivates, you should not criticize him casually."

Mu Qishan's suppression of criticism and resistance to higher authorities was extremely serious. In 1951, Mu Qishan, under the pretext of "understanding and caring about the ideological dynamics of employees," arbitrarily inspected employees' private letters and withheld employees' accusations against him. In April of the year before last, Zhao Sheng, the factory's assistant engineer, wrote a special article for the People's Daily entitled "Learning 'On Practice' and Improving Factory Work," criticizing the production management of the Automobile Parts Manufacturing Plant. When the People's Daily published this article on page 3 on June 8, Mu Qishan called on all employees to write counter-attack articles on the factory's broadcasting station. He himself wrote an article under the name of Sun Zhiqiang, insulting Zhao Sheng for "wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, stealing On Practice, and having ulterior political motives." Then, Mu Qishan incited the factory's cadres to conduct a two-week struggle meeting against Zhao Sheng, instructing employees in each workshop to write articles to the People's Daily, insisting that the People's Daily had casually published the article by "reactionary element" Zhao Sheng without investigation and research. On the other hand, Mu Qishan wrote a letter to the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the name of the factory's Party Committee, saying that Zhao Sheng's writing was "distorting theory, ...diverting the attention of the masses, sensationalizing, and concealing his reactionary features." Finally, Mu Qishan forced Zhao Sheng to "admit his mistakes" and guarantee that he would no longer submit articles to the Party newspaper without leadership review. Zhou Mingzhu (Party member), a worker in the factory's rubber department, was a model worker of the Northwest Military Region Logistics Office (Class A). In 1951, he reported to the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions that the factory did not pay attention to labor insurance regulations and other issues. After Mu Qishan found out, he immediately announced the suspension of Zhou's Party membership, forced him to suspend work for self-criticism, and gave Zhou a public warning within the Party. In May 1951, a person named "a group of workers" submitted an article to the "Workers' Daily," accusing Mu Qishan of seven mistakes. The Northwest Logistics Office ordered him to make a self-criticism and explanation. Mu not only refused to make a self-criticism, but also asked the office for the original document to investigate the accusers, falsely claiming that it was "done by reactionary elements."

Mu Qishan's bully behavior by virtue of his position is also manifested in his lewd private life and his unreasonable haggling over supply and treatment. Mu Qishan was originally married. He fell in love with Zhou Yiping without going through divorce procedures, but after getting married, he wrote a love letter to a female employee, saying: "If your permission is obtained, it should accelerate your approach to the Party, and you should have a position above the rank of platoon leader." The entire factory's employees were extremely resentful of this shameful behavior of trying to achieve personal goals by enticing them with fame and fortune. When the factory changed to a salary system last July, in order to fight for more wages and attack the factory director Liu Shaopeng, he shamelessly boasted about himself at the salary evaluation group meeting, saying: "Liu Shaopeng (the factory director) cannot compare with me in any aspect, my salary must be higher than his...." At the group meeting, someone suggested a compromise, saying that the factory director and the political commissar should be at the same level. Mu Qishan said that this was "divorced from political tendencies." Because of this issue, Mu Qishan not only argued at the Party Committee meeting, but also wanted all the factory's employees to discuss "which is more important in the factory, politics or technology," until he obtained a higher salary, he was willing to stop. Some unprincipled people, in order to cater to his so-called "politics must lead technology" requirement, even evaluated Mu Qishan's nine-year-old child with forty units of "salary."

In order to cover up his crimes, Mu Qishan repeatedly refused to allow higher authorities to inspect him. In May and July of last year, the Transportation Department of the General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Northwest Bureau, the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions, and the Northwest Logistics Office sent working groups to the factory to inspect the work. Mu Qishan immediately sent people to eavesdrop in advance and openly threatened those who expressed opinions. In early December of last year, the working group came to the factory for the second time to investigate his illegal and undisciplined behavior, and he looked for various excuses to refuse to attend the meeting, slandering the enlarged meeting of the Party Committee as "an unhealthy trend." He absurdly wrote a letter to the branch secretary of the Power Department, saying: "Bad elements have stirred up a storm in the factory, and most of the Party members have betrayed the interests of the Party, and all the secrets of the Party have been confessed by Party members." What is even worse is that he threatened the vice chairman of the trade union, Zhu Chengxiu, and Chen Liangui of the personnel section, saying: "You must consider your Party membership." He believes that cadres who expose his illegal and undisciplined behavior are "expanding disputes, framing 'dissidents'," and are "non-organizational activities, obliterating the truth, abandoning their positions, engaging in speculation, and abandoning the interests of the Party," and so on.

The fact that Mu Qishan's illegal and undisciplined behavior and his anti-Party behavior have not been exposed for a long time is largely the responsibility of the other members of the factory's Party Committee. Some Party Committee members, such as Vice Factory Director and Party Committee member Zhu Shu, and alternate Party Committee members Yang Zhengxi and Song Zhaolu, in order to gain Mu Qishan's "trust" and "reuse," did not hesitate to abandon the interests of the Party and helped Mu Qishan to engage in illegal and undisciplined behavior on many issues. For example, Vice Factory Director Zhu Shu, when Mu Qishan attacked Factory Director Liu Shaopeng, did not adhere to principles and resolve this issue, but instead adopted a two-faced attitude, distorting the facts and inciting the masses to attack the factory director together with Mu Qishan. When Mu Qishan was conducting various activities in order to get more salary points, he actively agreed to evaluate Mu Qishan's nine-year-old child with forty units of "salary." The other members of the factory's Party Committee, such as Factory Director Liu Shaopeng, Security Section Chief Wei Shaoying, and former Party Committee member and General Affairs Section Chief Yang Shengcai, had reported some of Mu Qishan's past illegal and undisciplined behavior to higher authorities in oral and written form. On some issues, they had also raised different opinions to Mu Qishan at the Party Committee meetings. However, their struggle against Mu Qishan was very weak, and some issues ultimately agreed with Mu Qishan's illegal and undisciplined claims. For example, Pan Qun's expulsion from the Party and illegal arrest were all approved by all members of the Party Committee. In addition, on many issues, such as Mu Qishan's illegal struggle against Zhao Sheng for writing to the People's Daily, the members of the factory's Party Committee knew that this was unreasonable, but they lacked the principles and fighting spirit that Communist Party members should have. On many issues, they only considered their personal gains and losses, and rarely considered the cause of the Party. Because the Party Committee members basically held these two kinds of wrong attitudes, Mu Qishan could turn the factory's Party Committee into a legitimate tool for his illegal and undisciplined behavior and do whatever he wanted.

The fact that Mu Qishan's illegal and undisciplined behavior and his anti-Party behavior have not been exposed for a long time is inseparable from the bureaucratic leadership style of the Northwest Logistics Office. In 1951, the office basically adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards the Automobile Parts Manufacturing Plant. In September 1952, the Transportation Department of the General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission proposed to remove Mu from his position and conduct a thorough investigation; however, the Logistics Department of the Northwest Military Region did not immediately implement this instruction, causing Mu Qishan to continue to do evil and undermine production in his "independent kingdom."

In early December of last year, the Political Department directly under the General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission, the Logistics Department of the Northwest Military Region, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Northwest Bureau, the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions and other agencies jointly formed a working group to inspect Mu Qishan's illegal and undisciplined behavior, and the factory's Party Committee announced the punishment of removing Mu Qishan from his work within the Party and administratively removing him from his position. This caused widespread dissatisfaction among the factory's employees. Some employees, seeing the news that Huang Yifeng had been expelled from the Party for suppressing criticism, believed that the handling of Mu Qishan was too lenient. A bad element with such extremely bad character should have been expelled from the Party and punished according to law long ago. Therefore, it is hoped that the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Northwest Bureau and the Party Committee of the Northwest Logistics Department will seriously and earnestly handle the illegal and undisciplined incidents of the anti-Party element Mu Qishan.

    西北汽车制配厂第一厂政治委员
    牟岐山是比黄逸峰更加恶劣的坏分子
    西北军区后勤办事处汽车制配厂第一厂政治委员兼该厂党委书记牟岐山，以反动作风对待职工，拉拢坏人，打击好人，扣押群众，压制批评，抗拒检查，群众认为他是比黄逸峰更加恶劣的坏分子。
    牟岐山为了在汽车制配厂第一厂建立个人独裁的统治，以反动的恐怖手段，乱捕乱扣、斗争处罚、停工检讨、撤职扣薪、开除厂籍等等办法，代替工厂的民主管理。该厂三年来（“三反”运动除外），受各种处罚的职工有二百一十二名，三百四十四次，占全厂职工总数的百分之三十六，损失工时一万六千二百四十个。其中有不少人（特别是职员）是因为对牟岐山领导作风不满而提出批评，牟岐山就以“反领导”、“反组织”等等罪名，予以惩罚。该厂文娱干事潘群，思想有不少毛病，群众对他也有很多意见，但牟岐山却对他非常器重，并亲自介绍潘群入党。可是当潘群对牟岐山玩弄女性的恶行，向其他同志稍露不满时，牟岐山便认为触犯了他的“尊严”，立即将潘群非法管押起来，并宣布开除潘群的党籍，还非法地在党委会议室里给潘上了手铐。潘群被牟岐山陷害后，该厂职工异常不满，牟岐山就污蔑这些人“离心离德”，“纪律松弛”，“内奸行为”，接着又以“清除潘群思想”为名，迫令两个干部停工检讨，并开除了该厂两个学员。该厂通讯员杨庭华午睡时，牟岐山的小孩跑去吵闹，杨不耐烦地打了他一下，牟岐山便写信给该厂保卫科“要保障人权”，并亲自非法地将杨庭华管押起来。该厂医务所调剂员何善亭在小组会上和牟岐山的意见有分歧，牟便认为何是有意伤害“政委身分”，拍桌大骂，并将何管押起来。去年五月间，该厂工会改选时，牟岐山认为该厂组织干事莫萍应为候选人，当时该厂助理工程师赵晟指出莫萍品质不好，群众对他意见很多，不应当列为工会候选人；牟岐山便给赵晟按上了“捣乱工会选举”的罪名，让厂内开会进行斗争，后又将赵禁闭检讨十六天。牟岐山除了以上胡作非为，侵犯人权的违法行为外，更严重的是，凡是被他停工检讨处罚的职工，一律不发工资，逼使工人承认了自己的“错误”。由于牟岐山这种以反动统治者的手段对待工人阶级，严重地影响了工人的生产热情，因此汽车制配厂第一厂一九五二年的生产较一九五一年下降了百分之十三，生产效率下降了百分之二十五。
    牟岐山“唯我独尊”的统治，表现在对待厂内所有干部，完全采取了“顺我者存，逆我者亡”的极其反动的手段。该厂厂长刘少朋过去职位比他低，现在当了厂长，他很不服气，有意布置他的“得力干部”莫萍、杨正喜、宋兆禄、顾家华等，在职工群众中制造对刘的不满情绪。同时，他利用各种机会，煽动群众攻击刘少朋。并在群众会上公然说：“刘少朋是摆菜摊子的，还能办了这样大的工厂！”该厂保卫科长魏韶颖，曾向西北军区后勤办事处反映过他的违法乱纪行为，牟岐山便认为这是“歪风邪气”，“宗派活动”，在支委扩大会议上扬言：“宁放过三百万的贪污分子，不放过魏韶颖的思想。”牟岐山认为工会主席莫萍、支部书记杨正喜，是他“最得力的干部”。事实上莫萍是一个品质极坏的人，“三反”前贪污公款，“三反”中未作交代，在厂内乱搞男女关系；杨正喜是一个兽性淫荡的家伙，他曾在夜间闯入女学员的宿舍，并企图奸污工人家属，群众极为不满。可是牟岐山却强令群众将杨评为“政治教育工作模范”。“三反”运动中，职工检举莫萍有贪污行为，牟岐山一再为其辩护，并在群众大会上说：“莫萍是党委重视培养的干部，你们不要随便批评”。
    牟岐山平时压制批评、对抗上级的行为极为严重。一九五一年，牟岐山以“了解和关心职工思想动态”为名，擅自检查职工私人来信，扣压职工对他的控告书。前年四月，该厂助理工程师赵晟给人民日报写了一篇“学习‘实践论’，改进工厂工作”的专文，对汽车制配厂生产管理进行了批评。当人民日报六月八日三版发表这篇文章后，牟岐山就在全厂广播台上号召全体职工写反击文章，自己并以孙志强的名字写文章，污辱赵晟“披着马列主义外衣，盗窃实践论，另有政治阴谋”。接着，牟岐山又煽动该厂干部对赵晟进行两个星期的斗争会，指令各车间职工向人民日报写稿，硬说人民日报不经调查研究，随便发表了“反动分子”赵晟的文章。另一方面，牟岐山又以该厂党委会的名义给中共中央宣传部写信说赵晟写稿是“歪曲理论，……转移群众视线，哗众取宠，掩盖其反动面目。”最后牟岐山强迫赵晟“承认错误”，保证今后不经领导审阅，再不向党报投稿。该厂橡胶部工人周铭铸（党员），系西北军区后勤甲等劳动模范，一九五一年曾向西北总工会反映了该厂不重视劳动保险条例等项意见，被牟岐山知道后，立即宣布停止周的党籍，迫令停工检讨，并给周以党内当众警告处分。一九五一年五月署名为“一群工人”的曾向“工人日报”投稿，控告牟岐山七条错误，西北后勤办事处令其检讨与说明，牟不但拒不检讨，反向该处索讨原件，追查控告者，诬说是“反动分子所为”。
    牟岐山凭借职权的恶霸行为，还表现在淫秽的私人生活和蛮横无理地计较供给待遇上。牟岐山原来是结了婚的，他没有办理离婚手续，就和周依萍恋爱，但结婚后，又给一位女职员写恋爱信，说：“如果得到你的允许，就应该是加速你与党的接近，在职务上有相当排级以上的职务。”全厂职工对这种以名利引诱，企图达到个人目的的可耻行为，极为愤恨。去年七月该厂改薪金制时，他为了多争工资，打击厂长刘少朋，在评薪小组会上恬不知耻地吹嘘自己，说：“刘少朋（厂长）那一方面也不能和我比，我的工资一定要比他高……。”小组会上，有人提出调和的意见，说厂长和政委一样高低时，牟岐山便说这是“脱离政治倾向。”为此问题，牟岐山不仅在党委会上争执，并且要全厂职工中讨论“政治与技术在工厂那个主要”，直到获取了较高的工资，他才肯罢休。有些无原则的人为了附会他所谓的“政治要领导技术”的要求，还给牟岐山九岁小孩评了四十个单位的“工资”。
    为了掩盖自己的罪行，牟岐山屡次拒抗上级机关对他的检查。去年五月和七月，中央军委总后勤部运输部、西北局纪律检查委员会、西北总工会、西北后勤办事处派工作组到该厂检查工作，牟岐山即事前派人偷听，对反映意见的人公开进行威胁。去年十二月初，工作组二次到该厂调查他的违法乱纪的行为，他就寻找各种借口，拒不到会，污蔑党委扩大会议是“歪风邪气”；他荒谬地给动力部支部书记写信说：“在工厂坏分子掀起了风浪，大多数党员出卖了党的利益，党的一切秘密被党员自首了”。更恶劣的是，他威胁工会副主席朱成修、人事科陈莲桂说：“你们要考虑你们的党籍”。他认为揭发他违法乱纪行为的干部就是“扩大纠纷，陷害‘异己’”，就是“非组织活动，抹杀真理，放弃立场，投机取巧，放弃党的利益”等等。
    牟岐山违法乱纪和他的反党的行为，所以长时间未被揭发，该厂党委会的其他委员该负很大的责任。有一些党委委员，如副厂长、党委委员诸述，党委候补委员杨正喜、宋兆禄等，他们为了取得牟岐山对他们的“信任”和“重用”，不惜放弃党的利益，在许多问题上帮助牟岐山违法乱纪。如副厂长诸述，在牟岐山攻击厂长刘少朋时，不去坚持原则，解决这一问题，反而采取两面三刀的态度，歪曲事实，和牟岐山一起煽动群众攻击厂长；当牟岐山为了多拿工资分，进行各种活动时，他又积极赞同给牟岐山九岁小孩评四十个单位的“工资”。该厂党委会的其他委员，如厂长刘少朋、保卫科科长魏韶颖、前任党委委员总务科长杨生财等，他们曾以口头、书面向上级反映过去牟岐山的一些违法乱纪的行为，在部分问题上，也曾在党委会上向牟岐山提出了不同意见。但是他们对牟岐山的斗争表现得十分软弱，有些问题竟然最后同意了牟岐山违法乱纪的主张。如潘群被开除党籍，并被非法逮捕等等，都是党委会全体委员通过的。另外，有不少问题，如牟岐山非法斗争赵晟向人民日报写稿等，该厂党委会委员虽然知道这是无理取闹，但是他们缺乏共产党员应有的原则性和斗争精神，他们在许多问题上只考虑个人的得失，而很少考虑党的事业。由于党委委员之间，基本上抱着这样两种错误态度，牟岐山就可以把厂党委会变成他违法乱纪的合法工具而为所欲为。
    牟岐山违法乱纪和他的反党行为长时间未被揭发，是与西北后勤办事处的官僚主义领导作风分不开的。一九五一年间，该处对汽车制配厂基本上采取了放任不管的态度；一九五二年九月间，中央军委总后勤部运输部曾提出将牟撤职，进行彻底清查；可是西北军区后勤部没有立即执行这一指示，致使牟岐山在他的“独立王国”里继续为非作歹，破坏生产。
    去年十二月初，中央军委总后勤部直属政治部、西北军区后勤部、西北局纪律检查委员会、西北总工会等机关联合组成工作组检查了牟岐山违法乱纪的行为，由该厂党委会宣布给牟岐山以党内撤销工作的处分和行政撤职的处分。这就引起了该厂职工普遍不满，有些职工看到黄逸峰压制批评被开除党籍的消息，都认为对牟岐山的处理太宽容了。像这样品质极端恶劣的坏分子，早就应该开除出党，依法惩办。因此，希望西北局纪律检查委员会和西北后勤部党委严肃认真地处理反党分子牟岐山的违法乱纪事件。
