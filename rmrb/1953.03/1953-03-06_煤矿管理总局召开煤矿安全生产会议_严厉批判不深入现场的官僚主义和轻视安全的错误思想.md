    The Coal Mine Management Bureau Convened a Coal Mine Safety Production Meeting
    Severely Criticizing Bureaucracy that Doesn't Go Deep into the Field and Erroneous Ideas that Disregard Safety
    The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government convened a national state-owned coal mine safety production meeting from February 6th to 9th. Participants included deputy directors, engineers, safety inspection section chiefs, ventilation section chiefs, and union chairmen from major administrative region management bureaus and mining bureaus. The meeting severely criticized the bureaucratic work style of leaders at all levels who do not go deep into the field and fail to promptly resolve production technology problems, as well as the purely task-oriented view of prioritizing output over safety, and put forward necessary measures and requirements for future safety work.
    The safety work of state-owned coal mines across the country showed a trend of regression in 1952. Compared with 1951, deaths increased by 13 percent, minor and major work-related injuries increased by 51.3 percent, and the number of various accidents increased by 49.4 percent. The main reason for the casualties and accidents was the serious bureaucracy of leaders at all levels. They do not study their work, do not go deep into the field, only want output and new records, do not care about the lives, safety and well-being of workers, and lack a complete and comprehensive "safe production" perspective. For example, the gas explosion accidents at the Xi'an Coal Mine and Yangquan No. 4 Mine in the Northeast region could have been completely avoided. When the central inspection team suggested to the Huainan Coal Mine that it stop using diesel locomotives underground (which are prone to carbon monoxide), the mine's leaders not only did not accept it, but subsequently added another diesel locomotive. They also said in words that "safety is important" and "implement the safety production policy," but when it came to actually implementing it, they emphasized objective difficulties, saying: the equipment is not good and there is no money. However, the equipment at the Jiaozuo Coal Mine is not strong compared to the rest of the country, and there is not much money, but because the mine attaches importance to safety work from top to bottom and turns safety work into a mass movement, it basically eliminated fatal accidents throughout 1952. In addition, due to the lack of attention to safety, most mines' safety institutions are still unsound, with few people and low quality, or security inspection cadres have positions but no power.
    At the meeting, Song Zhichun, deputy director of the Coal Mine Management Bureau, severely criticized the bureaucratic work style and erroneous ideas of leaders at all levels who do not attach importance to safety work in his report. Chen Yu, Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, and Liu Lanbo, Deputy Minister, made important instructions on safety work. The cadres attending the meeting also went through repeated discussions and mutual criticism, so everyone had a further understanding of the harm of bureaucracy to work, and the pure production point of view that does not attach importance to safety has been basically corrected. The meeting determined: (1) Deaths must be eliminated in 1953, and accidents must be reduced by more than 50%; (2) Continue to carry out ideological construction for safety, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions that "while implementing the increase production and practice economy, we must pay attention to the safety and health of workers," and establish a comprehensive view of safe production; (3) A movement to learn from the safety production experience of the Shi Yuhai group must be launched nationwide;
    (4) Relevant cadres and technical personnel must study the security regulations and take periodic examinations. Those with good results will be rewarded, and those who fail will be demoted and have their salaries reduced. At the same time, security regulations must be regarded as laws to be enforced; (5) Strengthen technical management, establish a safety responsibility system, eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and resolutely implement the three major systems recommended by Soviet experts: handover instruction book, leadership instruction book, and inspection opinion book; (6) Strengthen security inspection institutions and give them positions and powers, and when the situation is serious, they have the right to stop operations in accordance with security regulations; (7) Determine that each business department is directly responsible for safety work, and the task of the safety inspection department is to supervise and inspect; establish a safety activity day. In addition, increase certain safety equipment as needed and as possible, such as ventilation equipment, lighting equipment, etc.

    煤矿管理总局召开煤矿安全生产会议
    严厉批判不深入现场的官僚主义和轻视安全的错误思想
    中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局在二月六日到九日召开了全国国营煤矿安全生产会议。参加会议的有各大行政区管理局和矿务局的副局长、工程师、安全检查科长、通风科长、工会主席等。会议严厉地批判了各级领导干部不深入现场、不及时解决生产技术问题的官僚主义作风和重产量轻安全的单纯任务观点，对今后的安全工作提出了必要的措施和要求。
    全国各国营煤矿的安全工作，一九五二年有倒退的趋势。一九五二年和一九五一年比较，死亡增加百分之十三，轻重工伤增加百分之五十一点三，各种事故的次数增加百分之四十九点四。造成伤亡事故的主要原因，是各级领导干部的严重的官僚主义。他们不钻研业务，不深入现场，只要产量，要新纪录，不关心工人的生命安全和疾苦，缺乏完整地全面地“安全生产”的观点。如东北区西安煤矿和阳泉四矿的瓦斯爆炸事故，都是完全可以避免的。淮南煤矿井下运输使用柴油车头（容易发生一氧化炭），中央检查团向他们提出停止使用时，该矿领导干部不仅不接受，随后又增加了一个柴油车头。在口头上他们也说“安全重要”，“贯彻安全生产方针”，但真正让他们贯彻的时候，他们却强调客观困难，说：设备不好，没有钱。可是焦作煤矿的设备在全国来说并不强，钱并不多，由于该矿自上而下地重视安全工作，并把安全工作形成群众性的运动，因而在一九五二年全年基本上消灭了死亡事故。另外，由于对安全不重视，目前大部矿的安全机构仍不健全，人少，质量低，或保安检查干部有职无权。
    会上，煤矿管理总局副局长宋之春在报告中严厉地批判了各级领导干部官僚主义作风及不重视安全工作的错误思想，中央人民政府燃料工业部部长陈郁、副部长刘澜波作了关于安全工作的重要指示，参加会议的干部又经过反复讨论、相互批判，因此大家对官僚主义给予工作的危害已有了更进一步的认识，不重视安全的单纯生产观点已基本上得到纠正。会议确定：（一）一九五三年一定要消灭死亡，事故要减少百分之五十以上；（二）继续进行安全的思想建设，必须坚决贯彻毛主席“在实施增产节约的同时，必须注意职工安全卫生”的指示，树立全面的安全生产的观点；（三）在全国范围内要开展一个学习施玉海小组安全生产经验的运动；
    （四）有关干部技术人员必须学习保安规程，定期考试，成绩好的奖励，不及格者降级降薪，同时，必须把保安规程看作法令去执行；（五）加强技术管理建立安全责任制，消灭无人负责的现象，要坚决执行苏联专家建议的三大制度：交接班指示簿，领导指示簿，检查意见簿；（六）加强保安检查机构，并使其有职有权，在情况严重时有权根据保安规程停止作业；（七）确定各业务部门为安全工作的直接责任者，安全检查部门的任务为进行监督和检查；建立安全活动日。此外，根据需要与可能增加一定的安全设备，如通风设备，照明设备等。
