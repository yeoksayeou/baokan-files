    Stop American Bacterial Warfare Crimes
    Fang Shishan, Secretary-General of the All-China Medical Association

    The American government, under the guise of the United Nations, sent troops to invade Korea and, after suffering a disastrous defeat, resorted to the heinous crime of using bacterial weapons against the Chinese and Korean people as a last-ditch struggle. This monstrous crime of American imperialism has been repeatedly and thoroughly investigated and completely confirmed by the "Investigation Team on Crimes of American Imperialism's Bacterial Warfare," the Investigation Team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and the International Scientific Committee. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace has also held "Exhibitions on Crimes of the American Government's Bacterial Warfare" in Beijing, Vienna, Berlin, and other places, publicly displaying evidence collected from various sources of the American bacterial warfare. Last July, I also made a "Statement on the Crimes of American Bacterial Warfare in Korea and Northeast China" at the special meeting of the World Peace Council in Berlin. After reporting on the American bacterial warfare crimes that I had personally participated in investigating, I said to the representatives of peace-loving people from various countries attending the meeting: "As an old Chinese doctor who has been engaged in medical work for more than 40 years, I feel indescribable anger at witnessing the heinous crime of American aggressors manufacturing plagues to eliminate peaceful people." At that time, my words resonated with the representatives of various countries. Despite the shameless denials of American imperialists, it is all in vain. Righteous people from all countries have expressed irrepressible anger at the American bacterial warfare crimes and have unanimously condemned them.

    Recently, the confessions of captured American officers Wiebel and Blair further exposed the US government's malicious plot to systematically expand bacteriological warfare, and revealed the US government's guilty conscience, fearing that the American people would know about its shameful acts of bacteriological warfare against the Chinese and Korean people. Wiebel confessed that the U.S. government was making every effort to keep things secret in an attempt to evade the censure of the world's just humanity, even emphasizing that "more importantly, to prevent our own people (referring to the American side) from knowing." But Wiebel's confession proves that any deceptive behavior by the U.S. government will only lead to more serious political and moral bankruptcy for itself. Wiebel confessed that when American "officers came to Korea, they found that their own government had completely deceived them, and still proclaimed to the world that it had not used bacteriological warfare. This made them ideologically suspicious of everything else the government said about the war in general, and especially about the war in Korea."

    Of particular note is that Wiebel admitted in his confession that the effects of American bacterial warfare were "not worth a fart," and said that "among the people I knew, not one said that our efforts, adventures, and deceptions had achieved even the slightest commensurate effect." This is ironclad proof that the anti-bacterial warfare struggle of the Chinese and Korean people and the mass patriotic health campaign of our people have powerfully defeated American bacterial warfare.

    Now, the American aggressors still have no remorse and are continuing to wage bacterial warfare to this day. All people of conscience and peace-loving justice in the world, especially we in the medical and scientific communities, should stand up to stop this crime of the American aggressors that violates international law, is inhumane, and destroys humanity, and fight to uphold the honor of science and the cause of world peace.

### 制止美国细菌战罪行

    制止美国细菌战罪行
    中华医学会总会秘书长　方石珊
    美国政府盗用联合国的名义，出兵侵略朝鲜，遭到惨败后，竟向中朝人民使用罪恶的细菌武器，以作最后的挣扎。美帝国主义的这种滔天罪行，已先后由“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”、国际民主法律工作者协会调查团和国际科学委员会进行反复的详细调查，完全加以证实。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会又先后在北京、维也纳和柏林等处举行“美国政府细菌战罪行展览会”，将各方搜集的美国进行细菌战罪证，公开展览。去年七月，我也在柏林世界和平理事会特别会议上，作了“关于美国在朝鲜及中国东北等地进行细菌战的罪行的发言”。我在报告了我曾亲自参加调查的美国细菌战罪行之后，曾向出席会议的各国爱好和平的人民的代表们说：“作为一个从事医务工作四十多年的中国老医生，目睹美国侵略者制造瘟疫来消灭和平人民的万恶罪行，我感到不能以言语形容的愤怒。”当时我的话引起了各国代表的共鸣。尽管美帝国主义者进行无耻的抵赖，但这是徒然的。各国的正直人士都对美国细菌战罪行，表示不可抑止的愤怒，并一致加以声讨。
    最近报载被俘美国军官许威布尔和布莱的供词，进一步暴露了美国政府有计划地扩大细菌战的恶毒计谋，揭露了美国政府做贼心虚，害怕美国人民知道自己对中朝人民进行细菌战的可耻的勾当。许威布尔供出，美国政府竭力进行保密措施，妄图逃避世界正义人类的指责，甚至强调“更重要的是避免使我们自己的人（按指美方）知道”。但许威布尔的供词，证明了美国政府的任何欺骗行为，都只有使自己在政治上道义上遭到更严重的破产。许威布尔供称：美国“军官来到朝鲜后，发觉他们自己的政府彻底地欺骗了他们，仍然向世界宣称它没有使用细菌战。这样就使他们在思想上怀疑政府一般地关于战争所说的所有其他事情，特别是关于朝鲜的战争。”
    特别令人注意的是，许威布尔在其供词中承认美国细菌战的效果是“屁都不值”，并且说：在“我所认识的人中，没有一人说我们的努力、冒险和诈欺已经取得了丝毫相称的效果”。这是中朝人民的反细菌战斗争，和我国人民的群众性爱国卫生运动，已有力地打败了美国细菌战的铁证。
    现在，美国侵略者仍毫无悔改之心，迄今仍在继续进行细菌战。全世界一切有人类良知的、爱好和平的正义人们，特别是我们医学界、科学界人士，都应该起来制止美国侵略者这种破坏国际公法、违反人道和毁灭人类的罪行，为维护科学的荣誉和全世界的和平事业而斗争。
