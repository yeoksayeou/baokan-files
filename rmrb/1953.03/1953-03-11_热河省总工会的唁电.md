Condolences from the Trade Union of Rehe Province

To the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions:

    With extremely heavy hearts, the workers of Rehe Province and the provincial Trade Union mourn the passing of Comrade Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world and the dearest friend and mentor of the Chinese people. The passing of Comrade Stalin is not only a great loss for all the working people of the Soviet Union, but also a great loss for the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world.

    At this moment of deeply mourning Comrade Stalin, the workers of Rehe Province cannot help but recall the care and selfless assistance that Stalin and the Soviet people gave to China. What we can never forget is that eight years ago, when the workers and people of Rehe Province were living a life worse than that of beasts of burden under the cruel rule of Japanese imperialism, the great Comrade Stalin sent the Soviet Red Army to the Northeast to liberate us; four years ago, when the plague created by Japanese imperialism was rampant in Rehe, Comrade Stalin again sent an anti-epidemic team to Rehe to eradicate the plague, saving the people of the province from disaster; when Rehe was rebuilding railways and carrying out other construction, it also received assistance from experts sent by Comrade Stalin. In order to commemorate Comrade Stalin's great and indelible friendship with the Chinese people, we, the working class of the entire province, vow to transform grief into strength, and with the greatest effort, advance along the path indicated by Lenin and Stalin in large-scale economic construction, learn from the advanced Soviet science and technology and production experience, and complete the national construction plan. We will also unswervingly unite with the Soviet working class, shatter any conspiracies of the aggressors, and fight to the end to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

                                    Trade Union of Rehe Province, China
                                    March 9, 1953

    热河省总工会的唁电全苏工会中央理事会：
    热河省总工会全省职工以极沉痛的心情，哀悼全世界劳动人民的领袖和中国人民最亲爱的朋友和导师——伟大的斯大林同志的逝世。斯大林同志的逝世，不仅是苏联全体劳动人民的极大损失，也是中国人民及全世界爱好和平人民的重大损失。
    热河全省职工在沉痛地悼念斯大林同志的时刻，不能不想起斯大林和苏联人民对中国的关怀与无私的援助。使我们永远不能忘记的是：八年前，热河工人和全省人民在日本帝国主义残酷统治下过着牛马不如的生活的时候，伟大的斯大林同志派遣了苏联红军出兵东北，解放了我们；四年前，日本帝国主义所制造的鼠疫在热河猖獗蔓延的时候，斯大林同志又派遣防疫队来到热河，扑灭了鼠疫。使全省人民免于灾害；当热河重建铁路及进行其他建设时候，也都受到斯大林同志派来的专家的帮助。为了纪念斯大林同志对于中国人民的伟大的不可磨灭的友谊，我们全省工人阶级誓把悲痛化为力量，以最大的努力，在大规模经济建设中，遵循着列宁、斯大林所指示的道路前进，学习苏联先进的科学技术和生产经验，完成国家建设计划。并坚持不懈地与苏联工人阶级团结一致，粉碎侵略者的任何阴谋诡计，为保卫远东和世界和平而奋斗到底。
                                    中国热河省总工会
                                    一九五三年三月九日
