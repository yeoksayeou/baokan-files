    The Northeast China Company of the China Department Store Corporation and the Northeast China Preparatory Committee of the China Store Employees' Union recently jointly convened the "Northeast China Department Store System Mobilization Meeting to Promote Advanced Experiences and Improve the Quality of Grassroots Sales Work." Business leaders and representatives of advanced workers from department stores in various cities and counties attended the meeting.
    In response to the poor planning in the operation of most grassroots stores in the Northeast China department store system, the inability to effectively organize supply based on the needs of the people, resulting in imbalances between supply and demand, large inventory backlogs, and slow capital turnover, the conference focused on introducing the preliminary experience of the Second Store of the Shenyang City Company of the China Department Store Corporation in implementing planned operations. The Second Store relied on sales teams to understand supply and demand. In the third quarter of last year, it initially determined the store's capital based on the needs of each sales team for each commodity. Subsequently, each month, the sales teams proposed team operation (supply and procurement) plans based on sales and the needs of buyers learned through "out-of-stock registration" and "counter surveys." The summary of each team's operation plan became the store's overall operation plan. In the past, accountants kept commodity accounts, but the figures in the accounts often diverged from the actual sales and inventory situation. Salespersons did not know the inventory situation and often requested goods randomly. Now, sales teams keep commodity card accounts, with each commodity having a card recording the entry, sale, and inventory situation. This allows sales teams to know the amount of inventory of a certain commodity at any time, and the store can thus control the use of funds and reduce blind procurement. The Second Store's preliminary planned operation and management reduced backlogs; inventory shrank, but the amount of sales revenue did not change, and capital turnover decreased from a maximum of eighty-two days to thirty-nine days.
    The conference promoted experiences on how to better serve consumers. The hardware and electrical appliance sales team of the Second Store of the Shenyang City Company of the China Department Store Corporation paid attention to how to meet customer demands for commodities. They recorded the items customers wanted to buy but couldn't find each day and formulated plans to increase the variety of commodities based on this daily survey of business. Since the second quarter of last year, the hardware and electrical appliance team has added one hundred types of commodities in this way. When customers wanted to buy a large quantity of items not available in the store, the team recorded the names, addresses, and phone numbers of these customers and actively prepared. When the items arrived, they notified them to come and buy. This made customers very willing to do business with the store and gradually became fixed customers of the hardware and electrical appliance team. The hardware and electrical appliance team already has thirty fixed customers, so the supply plan is relatively accurate, and the sales task has been overfulfilled with relative certainty every quarter. The conference also introduced the working styles of model salesperson Sun Fangzhi from the wholesale department of the Fengcheng County Department Store in Liaodong Province and model salesperson Li Shuzhen from the Fujin County Department Store in Songjiang Province in serving the masses. Sun Fangzhi often persuaded and mobilized rural supply and marketing cooperatives to add commodity varieties based on the needs of farmers he had already learned about; and he helped the cooperatives learn how to publicize the performance and functions of commodities, expanding the sales of state-owned industrial products. Li Shuzhen was deeply loved by customers because she could patiently and sincerely help buyers select commodities and publicize and introduce the functions of commodities.
    The conference also promoted the experience of carrying out political work in stores and proposed that grassroots stores must strengthen political work in the future to ensure improved operation and management. Due to the weakness of political work in grassroots stores in the past, it was impossible to correct the ideas of neglecting commerce, the mentality of hired labor, the supply system mentality, and bureaucratic work style that existed in many staff members, thus hindering the improvement of work quality. Representatives from the Second Store of the Qiqihar City Department Store in Heilongjiang Province and the Hailun Grain Depot in Heilongjiang Province, who were specially invited to attend the conference, reported their experience in political work. This involved conducting ideological education for employees in conjunction with business work, promptly promoting and rewarding advanced experiences, and encouraging the enthusiasm of employees; and launching work competitions in conjunction with improving the welfare of employees. Because the Hailun Grain Depot did a good job in political work, it regularly and satisfactorily completed its work tasks. The grain collection work was considered by local farmers as one of the "three satisfactions" in the county, and 33% of the grain depot's employees received the title of "Model Worker."

    东北区百货系统开推广先进经验动员大会
    中国百货公司东北区公司和中国店员工会东北区筹备委员会最近联合召开了“东北区百货系统推广先进经验提高基层售货工作质量动员大会”。出席这次大会的有各市、县百货公司业务负责人和先进工作者代表。
    大会针对目前东北区百货系统大部分基层商店经营计划性差，不能很好地根据人民需要组织供应，以致供求失调，库存积压很大，资金周转缓慢的情况，着重介绍了中国百货公司沈阳市公司第二商店实行计划经营的初步经验。第二商店依靠了营业小组掌握了供求情况，去年第三季度首先按照每个营业小组对每种商品的需要，初步核定了商店的资金，以后，营业小组每月根据卖货情况和通过“缺货登记”“柜台调查”所了解的买主的需要，提出小组经营（供应和进货）计划。各小组的经营计划汇总，就成为全商店的经营计划。过去由会计记商品帐，帐面数字常和实际销、存情况脱节，营业员不知库存情况，也常有乱要货的情形。现在由营业小组记商品卡片帐，每种商品有一张记有进、销、存情况的卡片。这样营业小组随时都知道某一种商品尚有多少库存，商店由此控制资金使用，减少了盲目进货。第二商店初步有计划的经营管理，使积压减少了；库存缩小，但卖钱额未变，资金周转由最高八十二天下降到三十九天。
    这次大会推广了怎样更好地为消费者服务的经验。中国百货公司沈阳市公司第二商店五金电料营业小组，注意如何满足顾客对商品的要求。他们将每天顾主要买而没买到的东西，都登记起来，按这种日常营业中的调查，做出增加商品品种的计划。从去年第二季度以来，五金电料小组这样增加了一百种商品。遇有顾客大量要买商店里没有的东西，小组就记下这类顾客的姓名、住址、电话号码，积极准备。东西到了，就通知他们来买。这样顾主很乐意和商店往来，逐渐成了五金电料小组的固定用户。五金电料小组已有三十个固定用户，因此供应计划比较准确，每个季度都比较有把握地超额完成了卖货任务。大会也介绍了辽东省凤城县百货公司批发部模范营业员孙芳芝和松江省富锦县百货公司模范营业员李淑珍为群众服务的作风。孙芳芝常常根据已经了解到的农民的需要，说服动员农村供销合作社增添商品品种；而且帮助合作社学习如何宣传商品的性能、功用，为国营工业产品扩大了销路。李淑珍因为能耐心诚恳地帮助买主挑选商品，宣传、介绍商品的功用，很受顾客爱戴。
    这次大会还推广了商店里进行政治工作的经验，并且提出基层商店今后必须加强政治工作，以保证改进经营管理。由于过去基层商店政治工作薄弱，未能纠正很多工作人员中存在的轻商思想、雇佣观点、供给制思想和官僚主义作风，因而阻碍了工作质量的提高。黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市百货公司第二商店和特邀出席大会的黑龙江省海伦粮栈代表，报告了他们的政治工作经验。这就是结合业务工作向职工进行思想教育，及时推广和奖励先进经验，鼓舞工作人员的热情；结合提高职工生活福利，发动工作竞赛。海伦粮栈由于政治工作做得好，经常圆满地完成工作任务，收粮工作被当地农民认为全县的“三大满意”之一，粮栈百分之三十三的职工得到了“模范工作者”的称号。
