Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 25 (TASS): Soviet representative Gromyko delivered a speech at the Political Committee meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on March 23 regarding the issue of the United States interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

    Gromyko said: The issue proposed by the Czechoslovak government and included in the agenda of the General Assembly—the issue of the United States of America interfering in the internal affairs of other countries—should receive serious attention from the Assembly. As everyone knows, the Soviet government, regarding the US government's passage of the so-called "Mutual Security Act of October 10, 1951," sent a note to the US government on November 21, 1951, expressing resolute protest against this new aggressive bill of the US government against the Soviet Union.

    Gromyko said: The Soviet government at that time also drew the US government's attention to the fact that the US President's signing of this bill demonstrated that the US government was violently violating the obligations it had undertaken to the Soviet Union when establishing diplomatic relations with it.

    Gromyko asked: What was the US government's response to the aforementioned note from the Soviet government?

    The US government avoided the issue. First, the US State Department, in a statement issued on November 21, 1951, brazenly insisted that the Soviet Union had no reason to accuse the US government of passing a bill appropriating $100 million for subversive activities against the Soviet Union and people's democracies. Second, the US note to the Soviet government on December 19, 1951, also contained the same brazen arguments.

    Gromyko said: Therefore, naturally, the Soviet government, in another note on January 9, 1952, pointed out that the US government's attempt to exonerate itself and its actions was completely untenable, and reiterated that the bill passed on October 10, 1951, was an act of aggression against the Soviet Union.

    Gromyko continued: The Soviet Union's position on this issue was also clarified during the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly held in 1951. During that session, the Soviet delegation cited many facts and arguments to prove the criminal nature of the various measures stipulated in the aforementioned bill. Unfortunately, the United Nations at that time failed to concentrate sufficient strength to give due consideration to the aforementioned bill, and also did not adopt the necessary measures to recommend the US government to abolish this bill, as proposed by the Soviet delegation.

    Gromyko asked: What has happened since the Soviet government sent the aforementioned note to the US government and the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly discussed this issue? Since then, the US government has not only not taken steps to abolish this bill, but has subsequently ratified it.

    On June 20, 1952, a similar "Mutual Security Act" was passed in the same manner. This bill stipulates that previously allocated funds should be used for destructive activities against the Soviet Union and some other countries, and that additional funds can be used for this purpose.

    The past period has also demonstrated that both of these bills have been used as a basis for taking practical measures to provide funding for the aforementioned criminal activities against the Soviet Union and people's democracies. Many US political leaders have spoken frankly and publicly about this matter; US newspapers also frequently mention it, even boasting that the various US official agencies directing these activities are actually using the funds allocated for this purpose in these activities.

    Gromyko cited many facts and figures from the official reports published by US political leaders, from US newspaper reports, and from the meeting records of US congressional committees, to prove that certain groups in the United States have already begun to engage in destructive and espionage activities against the Soviet Union and people's democracies.

    Gromyko continued, certain groups in the United States do not like the socialist construction of the Soviet Union. They do not like the achievements in the development of the Soviet economy and the development of socialist culture. In this regard, we believe they have reason to feel uneasy, because these achievements prove, and we have never concealed it, that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system.

    Certain groups in the United States do not like the existing political systems in some countries, for example, they do not like the existing systems in the people's democracies. They hope to see these countries have systems similar to those countries that are economically and politically dependent on the United States. However, everyone knows what the systems in those countries are like. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, or the People's Republic of China, or any other people's democracy, have no intention of imitating them. The people of these countries have already taken the destiny of their countries into their own hands, and are successfully advancing from victory to victory in building socialism, and in fraternal friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union, under the great teachings of Lenin and Stalin.

    But is this a reason for any country to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries? Is this a reason for the United States to organize armed bandits to carry out destructive and terrorist activities against these countries? Of course not. This kind of interference undermines the basic principles and main foundation of the United Nations, an organization of sovereign states. Interference by certain countries in the internal affairs of other countries, and interference by the entire United Nations, is contrary to these principles and foundation.

    Gromyko listed conclusive evidence obtained from the materials of the trials of American spies and saboteurs in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and some other countries, which demonstrated that the criminal "Mutual Security Act" passed by the United States had been put into effect. The Soviet representative also listed facts to prove that the US authorities are conducting active activities in West Germany according to the laws of October 10, 1951, and June 20, 1952, establishing many terrorist and destructive organizations in order to carry out criminal activities against the Soviet Union, the people's democracies, and the democratic groups and leaders in Germany.

    Gromyko pointed out: In the territory of the People's Republic of China, some spy and sabotage organizations funded and directed by various American agencies have also been discovered.

    Gromyko concluded: In view of all these facts, and the fact that the aforementioned US laws and the actions they stipulate constitute a blatant interference by the United States in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union and some other countries, the Soviet delegation considers it necessary to declare its full support for the proposal put forward by the Czechoslovak delegation.

    The Soviet delegation believes that, in considering the importance of this issue, the General Assembly must condemn the subversive activities organized by the US government under the Act of October 10, 1951, the United States uses this law to allocate one hundred million US dollars to fund military groups and individuals to carry out espionage and destructive activities, engage in terrorist and other criminal actions against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democracies. The General Assembly must also condemn the similar law passed on June 20, 1952. If the General Assembly is truly concerned about whether the lofty principles written in the United Nations Charter are being observed, then it must denounce these laws, considering them as acts of aggression, interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and all of this is contrary to the principles of the United Nations and recognized standards of international law. The General Assembly must also recommend that the US government take measures to abolish the part of the aforementioned bills that allocates funds for destructive and espionage activities. We believe that the adoption of such a resolution is not only beneficial to the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and the people's democracies, but also beneficial to the United Nations and beneficial to the maintenance of world peace.

    葛罗米柯关于美国干涉他国内政问题的演说
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十五日电：苏联代表葛罗米柯在联合国大会政治委员会二十三日会议上，就美国干涉他国内政问题发表了演说。
    葛罗米柯说：根据捷克斯洛伐克政府的建议而列入大会议程的问题——美利坚合众国干涉他国内政问题应该得到大会的严重注意。大家知道，苏联政府曾经就美国政府通过所谓“一九五一年十月十日共同安全法”一事，在一九五一年十一月二十一日向美国政府提出照会，对于美国政府这个反对苏联的新侵略性法案表示坚决的抗议。
    葛罗米柯说：苏联政府当时并提请美国政府注意：美国总统签署这个法案，就表明美国政府横暴地违反了美国在与苏联建立外交关系时对苏联承担的义务。
    葛罗米柯问道：美国政府对上述的苏联政府的照会的反应是怎样呢？
    美国政府避开这个问题，首先是美国国务院在一九五一年十一月二十一日发表的声明蛮横无理地硬说：苏联没有理由指责美国政府通过拨款一亿美元充作对苏联和人民民主国家进行颠覆活动之用的法案，其次是美国在一九五一年十二月十九日致苏联政府的照会中，也载着同样蛮横无理的论据。
    葛罗米柯说：因此，很自然的，苏联政府在一九五二年一月九日的另一个照会中指出美国政府这种为它本身和它的行动开脱罪名的企图是完全站不住脚的，并且再度声明：一九五一年十月十日通过的法案是对苏联的侵略行为。
    葛罗米柯接着说：苏联对这个问题所采取的立场也已在一九五一年举行联合国第六届大会的时候加以阐明了。苏联代表团在那一届会议期间，曾引证了许多事实和论据，证明上述法案所规定的种种措施的罪恶性质。不幸的是联合国在那时未能集中充分的力量对上述的法案给予应有的估计，而且也没有按照苏联代表团所提出的提案，建议美国政府采取必要的措施来废除这个法案。
    葛罗米柯问道：自从苏联政府向美国政府提出上述照会以及联合国第六届大会讨论过这个问题之后，又发生了什么情况呢？从那时以后，美国政府不仅没有采取步骤来废除这个法案，随后反而批准了这个法案。
    在一九五二年六月二十日，又照着这个样子通过了一个类似的“共同安全法”。这个法案规定用以前所拨的款项对苏联以及一些其它国家进行破坏活动，并且可以用另外的款项来达到这个目的。
    过去的一个时期也说明这两个法案都曾经被当作一种根据，来采取实际措施供给上述对苏联以及人民民主国家进行的罪恶活动的经费。美国许多政治领袖曾直言不讳地并且公开地谈到这件事；美国报纸也时常提起这件事，甚至吹嘘指挥这些活动的各个美国官方机构真正地在把为这一目的而指拨的款项用在这些活动上了。
    葛罗米柯从美国政治领袖所发表的官方的报告中，从美国报纸的报道中，从美国国会各委员会的会议记录中引证了许多事实与数字，来证明美国某些集团已经开始对苏联与人民民主国家进行破坏与间谍活动。
    葛罗米柯接着说，美国某些集团不喜欢苏联的社会主义建设。他们不喜欢苏维埃经济发展与社会主义文化发展上的成就。在这一方面，我们认为他们有理由感到不安，因为这些成就证明，而我们也从未掩饰过，社会主义制度优于资本主义制度。
    美国某些集团不喜欢某些国家现有的政治制度，例如，他们不喜欢人民民主国家内的现有制度，他们希望看到这些国家有着和那些在经济上与政治上依赖美国的国家相似的制度。可是，大家都知道，那些国家的制度是什么样子的。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利或中华人民共和国或任何其它人民民主国家，都无意仿效它们，这些国家的人民已经把他们国家的命运掌握在自己的手里，并且正在伟大的列宁与斯大林的教导之下，在建立社会主义方面，在与苏联进行兄弟般的友好合作方面，成功地从胜利走向胜利。
    但是这是任何国家可以干涉这些国家的内政的理由吗？这是美国可以组成武装匪帮，对这些国家进行破坏和恐怖活动的理由吗？当然不是。这种干涉破坏了联合国这个主权国家的组织的基本原则和主要基础。某些国家对其它国家内政的干涉和整个联合国的干涉是与这些原则和基础相抵触的。
    葛罗米柯列举了从波兰、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克和一些其它国家审讯美国间谍和破坏分子的材料中所得的确凿证据，这些证据说明美国所通过的罪恶的“共同安全法”已经付诸实施了。苏联代表同时列举事实，证明美国当局正在根据一九五一年十月十日和一九五二年六月二十日的法律在西德进行积极活动，建立许多恐怖和破坏组织，以便对苏联、各人民民主国家、对德国的民主团体和领袖进行罪恶活动。
    葛罗米柯指出：在中华人民共和国的领土上，也发现了一些受各个美国机关资助和指挥的间谍和破坏组织。
    葛罗米柯最后说：鉴于所有这些事实，以及上述美国法律和它们所规定的行动就是美国对苏联和一些其它国家的内政进行罪恶昭彰的干涉，苏联代表团认为有必要声明完全支持捷克斯洛伐克代表团提出的提案。
    苏联代表团认为：大会在考虑这个问题的重要性时，必须对美国政府根据一九五一年十月十日的法案组织颠覆活动提出谴责，美国利用这个法律拨款一亿美元，资助军事集团和个人对苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家进行间谍和破坏活动，从事恐怖和其他罪恶行动。大会也必须谴责一九五二年六月二十日通过的类似的法律。假如大会真正关心联合国宪章所写下的崇高原则是否被遵守，那末它就必须痛斥这些法律，认为它们是侵略行为，是干涉他国内政，而这一切是违背联合国的原则和公认的国际法标准的。大会还必须建议美国政府采取措施，废除上述法案中拨款资助破坏和间谍活动的部分。我们认为通过这样的一个决议不仅有利于苏联和中华人民共和国与人民民主国家，而且也有利于联合国，有利于维护世界和平。
