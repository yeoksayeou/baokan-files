Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 19th: The report from our Chief Liaison Officer, Colonel Zhu Ran, to our delegation's Chief Representative, General Nam Il, regarding the incident of U.S. aircraft bombing the Kaesong Neutral Zone on March 13th. The full text is as follows:

Regarding the incident on March 13th, at approximately 5:40 AM, when U.S. military aircraft illegally intruded into the airspace over the Kaesong Neutral Zone and bombed the city center, dropping over 20 bombs, injuring three people, and destroying three buildings, the joint investigation by both sides' liaison officers is reported as follows:

	I. At the liaison officers' meeting on March 13th at 3:00 PM, I, following instructions, first lodged a serious verbal protest with the U.S. side regarding this wanton violation of the agreement, and solemnly pointed out that the other party should recognize the extreme gravity of their continuous destruction of the agreement. I also proposed that both sides immediately conduct a joint investigation. The other party's Chief Liaison Officer, Colonel Carock, claimed that he would contact the appropriate U.S. authorities regarding this incident and then decide whether to conduct a joint investigation. After the meeting, the other party, through their security officer, informed our side that they would come for a joint investigation after the liaison officers' meeting on March 14th at 1:00 PM.

	II. On March 14th at 1:00 PM, the liaison officers of both sides met. The other party requested safety guarantees for all 27 personnel participating in the on-site investigation. After I agreed, at 1:35 PM, led by me and our liaison officers, Colonel Chai Chengwen, Colonel Xue Zonghua, and Colonel Huang Zhengji, Colonel Carock and Lieutenant Colonel Oderen from the other side departed from Panmunjom and jointly proceeded to the bombing site in the Kaesong city area.

	III. The site of the bombing was only about 500 meters from the Kaesong traffic center and only dozens of meters from the residence of our delegation. Both sides first inspected sixteen exploded and unexploded fragmentation bomb craters. Countless shrapnel fragments were scattered around the craters. Unexploded fragmentation bombs were still in the soil, with only the tail fins exposed. I proposed that technical personnel from both sides could dig out the unexploded bombs and take them back as material evidence, but Colonel Carock stated, "We don't want to dig them up; they have potential dangers." Both sides also inspected the three destroyed buildings, one of which was the Kaesong Municipal Cinema, whose roof had been blown through, with shrapnel and rubble everywhere. Another was the residence of the cinema's staff, which was where the three people were injured; the house had collapsed, and rubble filled the room. Bloodstains were still visible inside the collapsed house. The third was the cinema's warehouse, whose roof had been blown through. With my consent, the other side took some of the tail fins and shrapnel from the fragmentation bombs at each crater and destroyed building.

	IV. Both sides then questioned witnesses. The three injured individuals, Yin Yonghao, Jin Shunjun, and Li Shizhen, were all assistant projectionists at the Kaesong Cinema. When the U.S. military aircraft carried out the bombing on March 13th, the three were resting and did not have time to escape, and were injured in the bombing. Yin Yonghao sustained injuries to his head, right wrist, and buttocks. He took out the shirt he was wearing when he was injured, which was covered in bloodstains. The other party requested that we provide the shrapnel that hit the injured. We retrieved the shrapnel removed from Yin Yonghao's right wrist from the hospital and handed it over to the other party to take back. Yin Yonghao testified that he was awakened from his sleep by the sound of an airplane on the morning of March 13th, and then his residence was bombed, and he was injured. He was rescued by neighbors and sent to the hospital. It was already dawning when the bombing occurred. The second injured person, Jin Shunjun, had shrapnel pass through his right leg and enter his left leg, and he is still unable to move. He pointed out that, judging from the sound of the aircraft, it was propeller-driven and conducted the bombing at low altitude. The third injured person, Li Shizhen, had his right leg struck by shrapnel. He also pointed out that, judging from the sound of the aircraft, the aircraft flew very low and was a propeller-driven aircraft. When Li Shizhen testified, the other party's Chief Liaison Officer, Colonel Carock, asked if the bombs were dropped by an airplane. Li Shizhen solemnly told the other party, "Of course, they were dropped by an airplane; what else could drop the bombs?" Both sides also questioned Shen Xianzhu, a public security officer who was on duty near the scene when the incident occurred. He testified that at approximately 5:40 AM on March 13th, he witnessed one twin-engine propeller aircraft from the other side circling at low altitude above the incident site before diving and bombing, and then flying towards the southwest. At that time, it was near dawn, and the weather was good.

	V. Both sides then jointly investigated the location where one napalm bomb landed, about 50 meters from the site where the fragmentation bombs landed. The napalm bomb burned after landing, but a relatively complete shell, as well as oil stains and shrapnel, remained. After wiping away the dirt on a large piece of shrapnel, the following markings were found: First line: LOT, Second line: ZM57, Third line: 65. With my consent, the other party took the shell of the napalm bomb and the soil stained with napalm. The joint investigation concluded at 3:53 PM, and both sides left the scene to attend a meeting in Panmunjom.

	VI. At the liaison officers' meeting, I pointed out that the craters, tail fins, shrapnel, and unexploded bombs inspected during the joint investigation, and the testimonies of the injured and witnesses heard by both sides, irrefutably proved the serious responsibility of the other party for this intentional provocative action. I also reiterated the serious protest made under orders on March 13th and demanded a swift, responsible, and clear explanation from the other party. However, Colonel Carock, as in past incidents of violations of the agreement by the other party, once again adopted the customary delaying tactics, claiming that an internal investigation was still underway, and openly stated that he currently refused to discuss this incident. I finally pointed out that in the face of ironclad facts, no denial from the other party is allowed, and the other party must promptly provide a responsible explanation.

    我方首席联络官关于美机轰炸开城中立区事件给南日将军的报告
    【新华社开城十九日电】我方首席联络官朱然上校关于三月十三日美方飞机轰炸开城中立区事件给我方代表团首席代表南日将军的报告。全文如下：
    关于三月十三日五时四十分左右，美方军用飞机非法侵入开城中立区上空轰炸市区中心，投弹二十余枚、打伤三人、炸毁建筑物三处的事件，双方联络官共同调查经过报告如下：
    一、三月十三日十五时双方联络官会议上，我对美方这一恣意违反协议的事件，按照指示向对方先行口头提出严重抗议，并严正指出对方应该认识到其连续不断破坏协议的极端严重性。我并向对方提出双方应立即进行共同调查。对方首席联络官卡洛克上校声称：关于这一事件，他将与美方的适当当局联系，然后决定是否进行共同调查。会后对方经安全军官通知我方：将在三月十四日下午一时双方联络官会晤后前来进行共同调查。
    二、三月十四日十三时，双方联络官会晤。对方请求对于对方参加实地调查的人员全体二十七人给予安全保证。经我同意后，十三时三十五分，由我以及我方联络官柴成文上校、薛宗华上校、黄政基上校带领对方卡洛克上校、奥得伦中校等人员自板门店出发，共同前往开城市区美方军用飞机投弹地点进行实地调查。
    三、轰炸事件的现场距开城交通中心点仅五百公尺左右，距我方代表团住所仅数十公尺。双方首先检查了已爆炸和尚未爆炸的杀伤弹弹坑十六处，弹坑的周围落有无数的弹片。未爆炸的杀伤弹尚在泥土中，仅露出弹尾。我提出双方技术人员可以将未爆炸的炸弹挖出，由双方作为物证带回，但对方卡洛克上校声称：“我们不愿意挖它们，它们有潜在性的危险。”双方并检查了被炸毁的建筑物三处，其中一处是开城市立电影院，屋顶已被炸穿，弹片与瓦砾遍地皆是。另一处为该电影院工作人员的住所，亦即三人受伤的地点；房屋已炸塌，屋内满布瓦砾，在炸塌的屋内还存有血渍。第三处为该电影院之库房，屋顶被炸穿。经我同意，对方在各弹坑与被炸毁的建筑物处取去杀伤弹的弹尾与弹片的一部。
    四、双方接着询问人证。三名受伤者尹永浩、金顺俊、李士真，都是开城电影院的助理放映员。三月十三日美方军用飞机施行轰炸时，三人正在休息，未及逃避，被炸受伤。尹永浩头部、右手腕和臀部受伤。他取出了受伤时所穿的上衣，上衣上血渍斑斑。对方要求我方提出击中伤者的弹片，我方从医院中取来自尹永浩右手腕中取出的弹片交予对方带回。尹永浩作证说：三月十三日清晨，他在睡眠中被飞机声所惊醒，接着住所被炸，他受了伤，由邻人急救后送入医院。轰炸时天已发亮。第二名受伤者金顺俊，弹片自右腿穿过钻进左腿中，迄今尚不能行动。他指出：从飞机的声音判断，飞机是螺旋桨式的，低飞进行轰炸。第三名受伤者李士真，右腿为弹片所击中。他也指出：从飞机声音来判断，飞机飞得很低，是有螺旋桨的飞机。李士真作证时，对方首席联络官卡洛克上校询问炸弹是否飞机所投掷，李士真严正告诉对方：“当然是飞机丢的，还有什么可以投弹？”双方又询问事件发生时在现场附近值勤的一名公安人员申贤珠。他作证说：三月十三日五时四十分左右，他目击对方双引擎螺旋桨飞机一架，在出事地点上空低空盘旋后即俯冲轰炸，然后向西南方向飞去。当时天近黎明，气候良好。
    五、双方随后共同调查距杀伤弹着地处约五十公尺的凝固汽油弹一枚着地的地点。汽油弹着地后已燃烧，但仍遗有较完整的弹壳以及油渍和弹片。在
    一块大弹片上擦去泥土后，并发现有下列的字样：第一行LOT，第二行ZM57，第三行65。经我同意后，对方取去汽油弹的弹壳和沾有凝固汽油的土块。十五时五十三分共同调查结束，双方离开现场到板门店开会。
    六、在双方联络官会议上，我指出：双方共同调查中所查看的弹坑、弹尾、弹片、未爆炸的炸弹，和双方所听取的受伤者和目击事件发生者的证词，无可置疑地证明了对方对这一有意挑衅行动的严重责任。我并重申三月十三日奉命所提出的严重抗议，要求对方作迅速负责和明白的交代。但对方卡洛克如同对待过去对方历次违反协议的事件一样，又一次采取了拖延的惯技，声称尚在进行内部调查，并公然声称目前拒绝讨论这一事件。我最后指出：在铁的事实面前，不容对方作任何抵赖，对方必须迅速作出负责的交代。
