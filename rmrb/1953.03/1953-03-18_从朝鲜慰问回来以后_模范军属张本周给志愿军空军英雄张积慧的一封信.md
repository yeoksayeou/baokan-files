After Returning from Comforting in Korea
—A Letter from Model Military Family Member Zhang Benzhou to Volunteer Army Air Force Hero Zhang Jihui

Jihui, my son:

After returning to the motherland, under the leadership of the superiors, I have completed the work of relaying messages after 51 days of effort. On the 26th day of the last lunar month of the year, the leaders of the Wendeng Prefecture of Shandong Province sent a special car to take me to our doorstep. It was almost midnight when I got home. When the village cadres and all the villagers heard about it, they all came to see me. Everyone asked about the Volunteer Army and you first.

During the Spring Festival, our family was very lively. The villagers hung new "Glory Plaques" and "Glory Lamps" on the doors of every martyr's family and military family, and pasted big red couplets. The children, wearing red scarves, beating drums and gongs, and dancing, paid New Year's greetings to the families of martyrs and military personnel. Our Rongcheng County government also sent Vice County Chief Jin with a big brocade banner to our family, and the district also sent one. The Beijing Film Studio also sent people to shoot a film. Jihui, seeing such glory today, aren't I happy?

Here I will also tell you about my situation in making reports in various places: In addition to giving a report in Jinan, our province, I have also been to many large places in Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces to give 28 reports. No matter where I went, whether it was workers, farmers, soldiers, government cadres, students, or people from all walks of life, as long as they knew I was your father, they would call me "Old Zhang" or "Father Zhang." Sometimes, I really felt embarrassed. They all asked after you.

Our delegation was warmly welcomed by the people everywhere when we went to various places to relay messages. Hao Jianxiu, a national model worker from Qingdao, specially rushed from the Workers and Peasants' Quick Literacy Middle School to listen to the report. She said: "I was very moved after listening to the report. I felt like I had taken a trip to Korea as well, which has greatly increased my strength for future study… I must do everything I can to study hard and prepare to serve the motherland and the people better." The students in Shanghai said: "Listening to such a report is more educational than watching ten movies or attending several political classes." In some towns in southern Fujian, many people came from dozens of miles away to listen to the report.

After the people of the motherland heard the messages, they had even more enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea, and increasing production. The Fourth Branch of the comfort delegation wrote to me, saying: The East China branches of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association have recently received thousands of comfort goods and letters of comfort. For example, Zheng Xiu, a model of public order in Xiamen Park Street, mobilized more than 20 women after listening to the report and made more than 30 comfort bags to give to the Volunteer Army. On the comfort bag she made herself, she also embroidered two red hearts linked together, indicating that the hearts of the Volunteer Army and the hearts of the people of the motherland are closely linked together. After listening to the report, the farmers all said: We have people, we have money, and we have grain. As soon as the Spring Festival was over, the people in our village fed fertilizer to the wheat fields, and so far, the whole village has fertilized two to three hundred mu; some have already started hoeing the wheat. Everyone has a strong drive: to ensure a bumper wheat harvest and support the Volunteer Army. The Zeng Guangfu mutual aid team in our province already had 20 wells last year. After listening to the report, they plan to strive to increase the number to 40 this year. After listening to the report, the People's Liberation Army soldiers and militiamen all said that they would learn from the Volunteer Army and from you, strengthen national defense, and be ready to crush the harassment of the US imperialists and the Kuomintang remnant bandits along the coast. The militiamen in our village have all checked the past paralysis in thinking and have taken emergency action. Their slogan is: Strengthen national defense and defend the coast. Now, they are on guard and patrol the coast day and night. After listening to the report, the military families in various places have written letters to their husbands and sons in the army, asking them to kill more enemies and make more meritorious deeds. For example, Chen Mingshan, the mother of a Volunteer Army soldier in Fuzhou, is already 63 years old. She wrote a letter challenging her son, guaranteeing that she would further improve patriotic sanitation, anti-espionage, and fire prevention work, strive for model plus model, and ask her son to kill more American devils in Korea and make more meritorious deeds for the people.

I will also tell you about my own plans: Our mutual aid team did not do very well last year. We have already started to reorganize it and are preparing to expand it further. In order to run the mutual aid team well, I talked with Lu Hongbin, a national agricultural labor model, in Jinan for two nights about the organization of mutual aid. He introduced me to many experiences. During the comfort visits, I also learned a lot of experience from labor model Zhang Fugui (who also participated in the comfort delegation). I must run the mutual aid team well this year and participate in the patriotic production increase competition. In less than ten days after returning home, I received more than 100 letters from workers, farmers, students, and others from all over the country. Eight mutual aid teams in Longchang County, Sichuan, in order to better support the Volunteer Army, jointly launched a wheat yield competition challenge to our team. I will definitely accept the challenge.

Jihui, the people of the whole country respect the Volunteer Army and also respect you. You must unite well with your comrades-in-arms, play a backbone role, and shoot down more American planes to repay the superiors and the people for their concern for you. Jihui: Work hard! I will definitely wait for you to take me to see our benefactor Chairman Mao.

Your Father, Zhang Benzhou

    从朝鲜慰问回来以后
    ——模范军属张本周给志愿军空军英雄张积慧的一封信积慧儿：
    我回到祖国以后，在上级的领导下，经过五十一天的功夫，已经完成了传达工作。在去年阴历腊月二十六日，山东文登专区首长派专车把我送到咱家门口，回到家时天快半夜了，村干部和全村人听说以后，都到咱家来看我。个个见面都是先问志愿军和你好。
    过春节时，咱家里可热闹啦。村里群众给家家烈属军属门上都挂上新的光荣牌、光荣灯，贴上大红对子。孩子们戴着红领巾，打着锣鼓，跳着舞，给烈属军属拜年，咱荣成县政府还派金副县长送来了
    一个大锦旗给咱，区里也送来一个。北京市电影制片厂，还派人来拍了电影。积慧，看看今天这样的光荣，你说我心里欢喜不？
    这里我再把到各地去作报告的情形告诉你：我除在咱省济南作了报告外，还到过江苏、安徽、福建、浙江四省的许多大地方作了二十八场报告。不管到那个地方，不论是工人、农民、战士、机关干部、学生以及其他各界人民，他们只要是知道我是你爸爸的，都叫我“张老”或“张爸爸”，有时，我实在觉得不好意思。他们都问你好。
    我们代表团到各地传达时，受到了各地人民热烈欢迎。青岛市全国劳动模范郝建秀特地从工农速成中学赶来听报告。她说：“我听了报告非常感动。我觉得我也像到朝鲜走了一趟一样，给我今后的学习增加了很大的力量……我一定要尽一切力量，好好学习，准备更好地为祖国和人民服务。”上海的学生说：“听这样的报告，比看十场电影，上几次政治课更有教育意义。”在福建南边一些城镇中，许多人从几十里地以外赶来听报告。
    祖国人民听了传达以后，抗美援朝、增加生产的劲头更足了。慰问团第四分团团部给我来信说：华东各地抗美援朝分会最近收到了成千上万件慰问品和慰问信。如厦门公园街治安模范郑秀听了报告以后，发动了二十多位妇女，做了三十多个慰问袋，转给志愿军。她自己做的那个慰问袋上还绣着两颗联在一起的红心，表示志愿军的心和祖国人民的心紧紧联在一起。农民听了报告以后，都表示：要人有人，要钱有钱，要粮有粮。咱村的人一过春节，就往麦地里喂肥田粉，眼下全村已喂了二、三百亩了；有的已下手锄麦子。人人都有一股劲头：保证小麦丰产，支援志愿军。咱省曾广富互助组去年已有二十眼井，听了报告以后，计划在今年争取增加到四十眼。解放军战士和民兵们听了报告以后，都表示要向志愿军学习，向你学习，加强国防，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义和国民党残余匪帮在沿海一带的骚扰。咱村的民兵都检查了过去曾经发生过的麻痹思想，紧急行动起来了。他们的口号是：加强国防，保卫海防。于今，他们不分白夜地在海岸上站岗放哨。各个地方的军属听了报告以后，都纷纷写信给自己在部队里的丈夫和儿子，要他们多杀敌，多立功。像福州一位志愿军战士的母亲陈明善，已六十三岁了，她写信向儿子挑战，保证进一步做好爱国卫生、防奸、防火工作，争取模范上加模范，并要他儿子在朝鲜多杀美国鬼子，为人民立功再立功。
    我自己的打算也和你说说：咱的互助组，上年搞的不大好，眼前已着手整理，准备再扩大些。为了搞好互助组，我在济南和全国农业劳动模范吕鸿宾，谈了两晚有关组织互助的事。他向我介绍了许多经验。在慰问的时候，我也跟劳动模范张富贵
    （他也参加了慰问团）学了许多经验。我今年一定要搞好互助组，参加爱国丰产竞赛。我回家不到十天的功夫，就收到各地工人、农民、学生等的来信一百多封。四川隆昌县八个互助组为了更好地支援志愿军，他们联名向咱组发起了小麦丰产竞赛的挑战。我一定应战。
    积慧，全国人民都敬爱志愿军，也敬爱你，你要和战友们好好团结，起骨干作用，多打下几架美国飞机，报答上级和人民对你的关怀。积慧：使劲吧！我一定等你领我去见咱的恩人毛主席。
    你的父亲　张本周
              二月二十三日
