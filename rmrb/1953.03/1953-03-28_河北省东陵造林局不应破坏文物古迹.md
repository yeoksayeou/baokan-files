    The Hebei Eastern Mausoleums Afforestation Bureau Should Not Damage Cultural Relics and Historical Sites
    Li Jingchi writes: The Hebei Eastern Mausoleums Afforestation Bureau was originally stationed in Dongling, Zunhua. They not only fail to protect local cultural relics and historical sites, but also arbitrarily destroy and steal them. They have successively dismantled and recklessly used all the wood and bricks of the Great Fragrance Hall of Jingling (the tomb of a concubine of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty), and also dismantled the white marble stones on the mausoleum to build pigsties. This behavior fundamentally violates the spirit of the Central People's Government's decision on the protection of historical relics. The Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry should strengthen education for the bureau and urge them to examine and correct their mistakes.

    河北省东陵造林局不应破坏文物古迹
    李景驰来信：河北省东陵造林局原驻遵化东陵。他们对当地文物古迹不但不加以保护，反而任意破坏盗用。他们先后把景陵（清代康熙偏妃的陵墓）大香殿的房木和砖石全部拆下胡乱用掉了，还把陵上的汉白玉石拆下修了猪圈。这种行为根本违反了中央人民政府关于保护历史文物决定的精神。河北省农林厅应对该局加强教育，并督促他们检讨纠正。
