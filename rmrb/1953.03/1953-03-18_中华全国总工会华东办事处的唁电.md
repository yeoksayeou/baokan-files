Condolence Message from the East China Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to the Central Council of Trade Unions of Czechoslovakia:

We are deeply saddened to learn of the sudden death of Comrade Gottwald, an outstanding fighter of the international workers' movement and leader of the Czechoslovak people. We extend our deepest condolences to you with extremely sorrowful feelings. The unfortunate passing of Comrade Gottwald is a major loss not only for the Czechoslovak people but also for the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. We firmly believe that the working classes of all countries, united under the banner of Lenin and Stalin and headed by the Soviet Union, will unite more closely together and fight to the end for lasting world peace and people's democracy, and for the cause of communism.

Long live the friendly unity between the workers of China and Czechoslovakia!
Comrade Gottwald will live forever!
                      East China Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
                                March 15, 1953
