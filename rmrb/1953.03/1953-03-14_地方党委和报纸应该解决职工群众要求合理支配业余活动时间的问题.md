    Local Party Committees and Newspapers Should Address the Issue of Workers and Masses Demanding Reasonable Allocation of Leisure Time

    Since November 6th of last year, this newspaper's "Readers' Letters" column has continuously published letters from many factory and mine workers urgently requesting reasonable solutions to the allocation of workers' leisure time. These letters reflect the situation in many factories and mines where there are excessive leisure activities for workers, excessive concurrent positions for cadres, and excessive meetings. These situations have made it impossible for workers to get the necessary rest and study time, which not only affects the health and the improvement of the political, cultural, and technical level of workers, but also directly affects production. In response to this situation, this newspaper has continuously published commentaries such as "We Must Reasonably Allocate Workers' Leisure Time," suggesting that local Party committees pay attention to and solve this problem. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' newspaper, Workers' Daily, the Beijing Daily, the organ of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Central and Southern China Workers' Daily have also published extensive articles calling for a solution to this problem and proposing solutions. The Central and Southern China Workers' Daily also launched a mass discussion in the newspaper on the topic of "How to Solve the Problem of Too Many Concurrent Positions." However, so far, only Beijing has truly paid attention to and vigorously led this work and has already made some achievements. Although the Party committees in some regions have expressed concern about this issue, they lack specific leadership; and the Party committees in most regions have not paid attention to it.

    At the end of the third quarter of last year, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China announced the "Decision on Reasonable Allocation of Workers' Leisure Time," and at the same time conducted key experiments in six units including the Shijingshan Power Plant. After gaining experience, it has been promoting it in all factories and mines in the city in a led and step-by-step manner. Now, the leadership focus of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Increased Production and Thrift Campaign Office has shifted from general arrangements and key experiments to investigating and studying the key issues that must be resolved in implementing this decision and conducting typical experiments. Since the end of October last year, the Beijing Daily has continuously published editorials, short commentaries, news, and cartoons on this issue, timely mobilizing the masses and guiding the movement. The Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has also sent working groups to key factories to study how the trade union work can cooperate with the Party and the administration to solve the problem of excessive leisure time for workers. It is precisely because the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches importance to this work and vigorously and persistently leads this work, and it is precisely because the Beijing Daily and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have timely cooperated with this work, that the factories and mines in Beijing have made remarkable achievements in solving this problem. The determination and experience of the relevant departments in Beijing in solving this problem are commendable and worth learning from.

    Although the Party committees in some regions have issued "Decisions," the problem of reasonable allocation of workers' leisure time has not been resolved due to lack of specific leadership. Shenyang and Tianjin can be taken as examples of this type of region. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on the Allocation of Leisure Time for Workers in State-owned and Public-owned Factories" as early as December 1951, but after a year, by December 1952, this "Decision" had not been well implemented. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China once instructed its subordinate Party committees at all levels to pay attention to reducing the phenomenon of excessive meetings and excessive concurrent positions for cadres in factories and mines as early as the beginning of 1950, but because of the lack of specific leadership, the serious situation of the problem remained the same. Although the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made "Regulations on Simplifying Organizations, Reducing Meetings, and Reducing Concurrent Positions for Cadres in State-owned Factories and Large Private Factories" at the end of last year, it is currently only rigidly controlling the leisure time of workers, without further active measures.

    It is especially worth noting that there are still many regions where the Party committees have not paid attention to this work at all. They still mistakenly believe that "the central task is very tight, so we can't take care of solving this problem," and "if there are many meetings and long hours, the work cannot be completed; if there are few meetings and short hours, how can the task be completed?" The newspapers and trade union organizations in these regions have also not actively supported the legitimate demands of the workers and masses, mobilized the masses to seek reasonable solutions, so as to promote the local Party committees to correct those lurking erroneous ideas in a timely manner.

    Of course, solving the problem of excessive leisure time for workers in factories and mines is not an easy task, and requires patient and persistent vigorous leadership. Many practical tasks also require a certain amount of time to be carried out gradually. However, as long as the local Party committee attaches importance to and leads this work, the problem can be reasonably solved. The achievements that Beijing has already made are the best proof of this fact.

    Since the work of reasonably solving the problem of leisure time for workers is something that should be done and can be done, how should we promote the regions that have not yet paid attention to this problem to carry out their work? The key lies in whether the grassroots trade unions and regional newspapers in the local factories and mines have mobilized and supported the legitimate demands of the workers. The Party and trade union newspapers in various regions should devote a certain amount of space to vigorously publicize and guide this work, should resolutely fight against erroneous ideas, and should grasp the key issues to organize mass discussions. Newspapers are powerful propagandists and organizers. If they do not support the masses on issues that workers and the masses are urgently demanding, and do not express opinions that represent the interests of the masses, then they will be divorced from the masses on this issue.

    Reasonably solving the problem of leisure time for workers is a common demand of factory and mine workers today. Party committees at all levels must specifically lead this work; newspapers and trade unions at all levels must vigorously mobilize the masses to participate in and supervise this work. Regions that have already made achievements should summarize their experiences and gradually promote them in a timely manner; regions that have not moved or have not moved well should take active and effective measures to catch up.

### 地方党委和报纸应该解决职工群众要求合理支配业余活动时间的问题

专栏：读者来信综述

    地方党委和报纸应该解决职工群众要求合理支配业余活动时间的问题
    从去年十一月六日开始，本报“读者来信”栏连续发表了许多厂矿职工迫切要求合理解决职工业余活动时间的来信。这些信反映了许多厂矿由于职工业余活动过多、干部兼职过多、会议过多的情况。这些情况已经使职工得不到必需的休息和学习时间，其结果不仅影响到职工的健康和政治、文化、技术水平的提高，同时也直接影响到生产。针对这种情况，本报连续发表了必须合理支配职工业余活动时间等评论，建议各地党委重视和解决这个问题。中华全国总工会机关报——工人日报、中共北京市委机关报——北京日报以及中南工人日报等也先后以大量篇幅刊登要求解决这个问题的群众呼声和提出解决这个问题的办法。中南工人日报还以“兼职多的问题怎样解决”为题，在报上发动群众来讨论。但是到目前为止，真正重视和大力领导这一工作并且已经作出一定成绩来的只有北京一地。有些地区的党委虽然对这个问题表示重视，但缺少具体的领导；而多数地区的党委还没有引起注意。
    去年第三季度末，中共北京市委员会便公布了关于合理支配职工业余活动时间的决定，同时在石景山发电厂等六个单位作重点试验；取得经验后已经有领导、有步骤地在全市各厂矿普遍推行。现在北京市增产节约竞赛运动委员会办公室的领导重点，即由一般性的布置号召和重点试验，转入贯彻这个决定所必须解决的关键性问题的调查研究和典型试验。北京日报从去年十月末，便围绕这一问题，连续发表了社论、短评、新闻和漫画，及时地发动了群众，指导了运动。北京市总工会也派工作组深入重点工厂，研究工会工作怎样配合党和行政解决职工业余活动时间过长的问题。正是由于中共北京市委员会重视这一工作，大力地、持久地领导这一工作，正是由于北京日报、北京市总工会适时地配合了这一工作，因此，北京市各厂矿在解决这个问题上已经取得了显著的成绩。北京市各有关部门解决这个问题的决心和经验是值得称赞和学习的。
    还有些地区的党委虽然发布了“决定”，但由于缺乏具体领导，合理支配职工业余活动时间问题并没有解决。这类地区可以沈阳、天津为例。中共沈阳市委员会早在一九五一年十二月便发布了“关于国、公营工厂职工业余活动时间支配问题的决定”，但为时一年，到一九五二年十二月，这个“决定”并没有很好贯彻。中共天津市委员会远在一九五○年初即曾经指示所属各级党委要注意减少厂矿职工会议过多、干部兼职过多的现象，但因为缺乏具体领导，问题的严重情况依然如旧。去年年底中共天津市委员会虽然作出“关于国营工厂及私营大厂中简化组织、减少会议、减少干部兼职的规定”，但目前还只是硬性地控制职工业余活动的时间，而没有进一步的积极措施。
    尤其值得注意的，现在还有不少地区的党委根本还没有重视这一工作，他们还错误地认为“中心任务很紧，顾不上解决这个问题”、“会多、时间长，工作还做不完；会少、时间短，任务哪能完得了”。而这些地区的报纸和工会组织也没有积极地支持职工群众的正当要求，发动群众寻求合理解决问题的办法，以推动当地党委及时纠正那些潜伏着的错误思想。
    当然，解决厂矿职工业余活动时间过长的问题，不是一件轻而易举的事，需要耐心持久地大力领导，很多实际工作也需要一定的时间逐步进行。但是，只要当地党委重视和领导这个工作，问题就可以合理解决。北京市已经取得的成绩就是最好的事实说明。
    既然合理解决职工业余活动时间这一工作是应该进行而且可以进行的，那么我们应该怎样推动那些还没有重视这个问题的地区开展工作呢？关键在于各地厂矿的基层工会和地区的报纸是否发动和支持了工人的正当要求。各地党和工会的报纸应该拿出一定的版面，大力宣传和指导这一工作，应该坚决地和错误思想作斗争，应该抓住关键性的问题组织群众讨论。报纸是有力的宣传者和组织者，如果在职工群众所迫切要求的问题上不支持群众，不发表代表群众利益的意见，那么在这个问题上就会脱离群众。
    合理解决职工业余活动时间的问题，是当前厂矿职工的普遍要求。各地党委必须具体领导这一工作；各地报纸和工会必须大力发动群众来参加和监督这一工作。已经作出成绩的地区，应该及时总结经验逐渐推广；还没有动和动得不好的地区，应该采取积极有效的办法，迎头赶上。
