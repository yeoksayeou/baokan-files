    A Happy Event
    — People Building Anshan, Part Four
    By Our Correspondent Lù Hào

    A young couple walked into Dashiqiao Railway Station. The man was of medium height and his strong build kept his face perpetually radiant. His bright eyes looked ahead at times, and at the crops in the fields at others, his gaze intentionally avoiding the pretty girl beside him. The girl appeared somewhat slender and delicate, a light blush floating on her fair, oval face. Although neither looked at the other, they walked side-by-side, neither ahead nor behind.
    The man was Wang Jixian, a squad leader from the concrete team at the large construction site in Anshan; the girl was Li Fangyun, a village girl from a rural area near the station.
    Wang Jixian had come to Dashiqiao, sixty kilometers from Anshan, to see Li Fangyun after getting off work last night. Today, he was rushing back to work, and Li Fangyun had come to see him off.
    They had only been on the platform for a short while when the train to Anshan pulled into the station. Although they had been talking for half a day, Li Fangyun felt like there were still things she wanted to say. Seeing the train about to leave, she knew she had to speak up, or she would miss her chance.
    "When..." she began, summoning all her courage, but still hesitant, "When shall we get married?" Before she could finish, she turned her face away, the girl blushing to the roots of her hair.
    He only nodded shyly, without saying a word, unsure how to answer.
    Li Fangyun's eyes followed him all the way onto the train. The snow-white towel around his neck and his new blue cloth suit set off his flushed face. Amid the crowded passengers, he seemed particularly young, handsome, and strong. They gazed at each other, mutually content, until the train pulled far away from the platform, a warm feeling filling the hearts of the young couple.
    When Wang Jixian returned to the construction site, the massive concrete pouring project was in full swing. The areas where he worked were five or six meters deep, or even deeper. Some of these foundations were very narrow, the densely packed steel reinforcing bars making it difficult for even an empty person to climb down. When working, people had to stand perfectly straight, operating with their hands but unable to move their bodies; sometimes, they even had to lie or kneel on the concrete, using their hands in place of crowbars. During these intense days, Wang Jixian always arrived before his shift started and was always the last to leave after it ended, work consuming the majority of his time.
    In September 1952, the concrete pouring project reached its peak, and Li Fangyun wrote a letter to Wang Jixian. She said she didn't want to stay in the countryside any longer and hoped to come to Anshan soon, asking if Wang Jixian could marry her during the Mid-Autumn Festival in August. Li Fangyun's letter caused great ripples in the heart of the young man who had lost his parents at the age of twelve and wandered the salt flats as a young laborer. Now, such a delicate girl was willing to marry him, something he had never imagined; but at the same time, he saw that during this most intense phase of the project, workers, because of the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, were already cutting out flowered crepe or colored broadcloth for their wives and buying small leather shoes for their children. Some of them were planning to ask for leave to go home. Many people wanted to go home, which would affect the progress of the pouring project. Weighing these matters in his heart, he thought he couldn't just ignore these things and focus on his own wedding.
    The news of Li Fangyun's letter spread throughout the team, and some workers joked with Wang Jixian, saying, "She's offering herself to you, and you don't want her?" Others said, "It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing, what are you still considering?" Some even said with genuine goodwill, "If you get married, we'll all have a good time!"
    The branch secretary also learned about this and specially sought out Wang Jixian, saying, "I'll give you three days off to go back and get married."
    How did Wang Jixian respond? He said, "I've thought it over. I won't get married now. I'll finish the task first."
    The construction site's broadcasting station quickly announced the news that Wang Jixian would finish the task before getting married. This news was more powerful than any mobilization method. It immediately spread to every corner of the construction site, deeply touching the heartstrings of those who were planning to go home for the festival. They said, "He can postpone his wedding, but we want to put down our work and go home for something minor? How can we be worthy of the country?" The team received many such opinions, some even offering sincere self-criticism.
    In September and October, the concrete team's attendance rate remained at 98 percent.
    However, this matter made Li Fangyun in the countryside very puzzled. She received a letter from Wang Jixian saying that he was too busy to get married. She wondered if he was really that busy, and if something else had happened that prevented him from marrying her. She decided to come to Anshan herself to see what was going on.
    One evening, they met.
        "Are you still so busy?"
        "Very busy!"
        "Really that busy?"
        "Who would lie to you about that?"
    Li Fangyun really didn't know how hectic the construction site was day and night. She still had some doubts in her heart. She said, "Don't your superiors care about our marriage?"
        "The superiors are very concerned. They'd even give me three days off for the wedding." He repeated what the branch secretary had said, and then talked about how the entire construction site hadn't completed its task in August, how the team launched a red flag competition, and how his work was indispensable. He asked Li Fangyun, "Can I abandon my work and only care about my own affairs?"
    Li Fangyun wasn't a clueless girl from the village. She retorted to Wang Jixian, "I'm not saying to only care about your own affairs. I'm saying that the country's affairs should be done, but you can also take care of your own affairs."
    "That's right! If our project can be completed one day earlier, the country can earn 7 billion more, do you know that?"
    Wang Jixian answered whatever Li Fangyun asked, as if no question could stump him. After thinking for a while, she suddenly asked Wang Jixian a question. She said, "Don't you like me?"
    He answered in surprise, loudly, "Why wouldn't I like you? Tell me, which is more important? Is it personal matters, or the country's affairs?"
    Li Fangyun didn't say anything else. That day, Wang Jixian sent her to the train back to Dashiqiao.
    In those days, everyone at the construction site worked day and night, some even had sunken eyes. Wang Jixian couldn't eat or sleep, talking in his sleep, acting like he was crazy. Especially when it came to uncovering the wooden planks, he would squat in front of the planks early, his eyes wide open, his heart pounding. If he saw no blemishes, he could eat a big bowl of rice; but if he saw pockmarks or honeycombs on the cement, he would be sad for days and unable to eat.
    Until mid-October, the concrete pouring project was still very intense. Li Fangyun in the countryside couldn't wait any longer and came to Anshan for the second time. This time, Wang Jixian told her that they could get married after completing the October task.
    So, Li Fangyun's heart was tied to the October task.
    One day, Wang Jixian told Li Fangyun, "The October task is almost done."
    "Really?" Li Fangyun was overjoyed.
    "Listen to the news tomorrow. If it's completed, we'll get married tomorrow."
    The large construction site's October concrete project was completed ten days ahead of schedule, which was the wedding day that Wang Jixian had told Li Fangyun about. That day, Wang Jixian returned from the construction site, and Li Fangyun was already waiting for him at the door, asking, "Is the task completed?"
    "Not only was the task completed, but we also got a model team title!" Wang Jixian's team won the glorious title of model team in the October Red Flag competition.
    Neighbors heard that they were getting married today and came to help them buy meat, get wine, and welcome guests. Wang Jixian also used his saved bonus, accompanying Li Fangyun to the department store to spend 170,000 yuan to buy a new pair of leather shoes.
    After a period of busy work, they changed into their new clothes, and the room suddenly became quiet.
        "Is this how we're getting married?"
        "Yes, is this how we're getting married?"
        "I'm saying, how are we getting married?"
    This question stunned Wang Jixian. He thought for a moment and came up with an idea. He said, "Let's hang a portrait of Chairman Mao and bow to him, okay?" His proposal was immediately approved by Li Fangyun.
    Wang Jixian and Li Fangyun bowed before the portrait of Chairman Mao, and they held their simple yet warm wedding like this.
    The day after the wedding, Wang Jixian returned to the construction site before his vacation ended, because their concrete team had already started working on the November task in the late part of October. (Attached picture)

### 喜事——建设鞍山的人们之四

    喜事
    ——建设鞍山的人们之四
    本报记者　陆灏
    有一对年青的男女走进了大石桥车站。那男的个子长得不高不矮，壮实的身体使他的面孔什么时候也红光焕发，他的一双炯炯有神的眼睛，时而看着前面，时而瞧着地里的庄稼，他的视线有意地避开他身边的那个俊俏的姑娘。那女的看来身体瘦得有些纤弱，在她的瓜子形的五官端正的脸庞上，浮着一层淡淡的红晕。他们两个虽然谁也没有看谁，但却是不前不后地，总是并排地走着。
    那男的叫王继先，是鞍山大型工地混凝土队的小队长；女的叫李芳云，是这个车站附近农村的一个姑娘。
    王继先是昨天晚上下班以后，到离鞍山六十公里的大石桥来看李芳云的，今天他忙着赶回去上班，李芳云是来送他上火车的。
    他俩走进月台不久，去鞍山的火车就已经进站了。他们虽然已经谈了半天话，但李芳云总觉得还有些话要说，她眼瞅着火车快要开走，别在肚里的话再不说，可就要马上失去机会了。
    “咱们……”她虽然是鼓足了勇气，但毕竟还是吞吞吐吐地说：“咱们什么时候结婚呢？”话还没有说完，她就扭转了她的脸孔，这位姑娘臊得连耳根也绯红了。
    他只是很腼腆地点了点头，没有说话，他不知怎么回答才好。
    李芳云的两只眼睛，一直滴溜溜地送着他走上了火车。他的头颈里系着一条雪白的毛巾和那套新的蓝布衣服，衬托着他那张煊红的脸孔，在满车拥挤的旅客中间，他显得比任何人都特别年青、漂亮和强壮。他们两个互相心满意足地望着，一直到火车远远地开出了月台，一股热呼呼的滋味塞满了这一对青年男女的心头。
    王继先回到工地的时候，庞大的混凝土浇灌工程正在紧张地进行。在他工作的那些地方，都是五、六公尺深，或者是更深些的基础。这些基础，有的很窄，密密层层的钢筋，空身人都很难钻下去。人们在工作的时候就得笔笔直直地站着，手要操作，但身体却动也不能动；有时候，甚至要躺在或跪在混凝土上用双手代替铁钎。在这些紧张的日子里，王继先总是没有到上班的时间，自己就先来了，到了下班以后，他总是最后离开工地，工作占据了他的绝大部分的时间。
    一九五二年的九月份，浇灌混凝土工程的工作进入了高潮，李芳云给王继先来信了。信上说，她不愿意再在乡下呆下去，她希望能快快到鞍山来，问王继先能不能在八月中秋节结婚。李芳云的来信，引起了这个十二岁就失去了父母、在盐滩流浪作小工的年青人的思想很大的波澜，现在有一个长得这样秀气的姑娘愿意嫁给他，这是他从来也没有想到的；但同时他又看到，正在这工程最紧张的时间，工人们因为中秋节的来临，他们有的已经给自己的妻子剪好了花哔叽或彩色的洋布，有的给自己的孩子买下了小皮鞋，他们之中有些人打算请假回家走一趟。很多人要回家，这就要影响浇灌工程的进行。他把这些事在心上秤来秤去，他想，无论如何总不能眼看这些事情不管，光顾自己结婚。
    李芳云来信的事儿不知不觉地传遍了全队，工人们有的跟王继先开玩笑说：“什么也不要你的，给你送上门来了，你还不要吗？”有的说：“一辈子的事儿，你还考虑什么？”有的更是充满着善意说：“你结婚，咱们大伙说说笑笑，那多好啊！”
    支部书记也知道了这件事，他特别找见了王继先，说：“准你三天假，回去结婚吧。”
    王继先怎样回答呢？他说：“我都想过了，现在不结婚，完成任务再说吧。”
    工地的广播台很快地播送了王继先完成任务再结婚的消息，这消息比任何动员的方法都有力量，它立时传遍了工地的各个角落，它是那样深切地触动着那些打算回家过节的人的心弦。他们说：“人家可以不结婚，咱们没有多大事儿就要放下工作回家，这对得起国家吗？”队部收到了很多这样的意见，有的对自己还提出了诚恳的批评。
    九、十月份，混凝土队的出勤人数，仍旧保持了百分之九十八。
    但是，这事情却使乡下的李芳云很纳闷，她收到了王继先的一封信，说是因为太忙不能结婚。她猜想他是不是真的这样忙，她猜想他不结婚是不是发生了别的事情，她决定自己到鞍山来看一看。
    一个晚上，他们两个见面了。
        “还那么忙吗？”
        “可忙哩！”
        “真的那么忙吗？”
        “那谁还骗你呢。”
    李芳云真不知道工地上黑夜白天到底紧张成个什么样儿，她的心里总还是有些怀疑。她说：“咱们结婚的事情，你们的上级都不管吗？”
        “上级倒是很关心的，结婚还放三天假呢。”他把支部书记说过的那些话重说了一遍，又讲到八月份整个工地没有完成任务，队上怎样展开红旗竞赛，他的工作怎样离不开。他问李芳云：“能扔下工作不管，光顾自己的事儿吗？”
    李芳云在村里头，也不是一个什么事也不懂的姑娘。她反驳王继先说：“我不是说光顾自己的事儿，我说国家的事当然要做，也可以顾顾自己的事儿。”
    “对呀！我们的工程能早修好一天，国家就可以多收入七十个亿，你知道吗？”
    李芳云问什么，王继先就答什么，好像什么问题也难不住他。她想了一会，突然地向王继先提出了一个问题。她说：“你是不是不喜欢我？”
    他吃惊地大声地回答说：“我为什么不喜欢你呀，你说，你说那件事重要？是个人的事儿重要呢？还是国家的事儿重要？”
    李芳云再也没有说什么。那一天，王继先送她上火车回大石桥去了。
    在那些日子里，工地上每个人都是不分白天，不分黑夜，有些人眼睛也塌下去了。王继先是吃饭吃不下，睡觉说梦话，人像疯了一样。特别等到揭木板的时候，他早早就蹲在木板跟前，眼珠瞪得大大的，心里砰砰地跳，一看没有出麻子，饭也能多吃一大碗，要是看到洋灰上出了麻子、蜂窝，心里要难过好几天，饭也吃不下了。
    一直到十月中旬，混凝土的浇灌工程依然十分紧张。李芳云在乡下实在等得沉不住气了，她第二次来到了鞍山。这一次，王继先告诉她，完成了十月份任务就可以结婚了。
    于是，李芳云的心和十月份的任务就系在一起了。
    有一天，王继先告诉李芳云说：“十月份任务马上就要完了。”
    “真的吗？”李芳云简直高兴极了。
    “明天你听信，明天要是能完，咱们明天就结婚。”
    大型工地的十月份混凝土工程提前十天完成了任务，那就是王继先给李芳云说的那个结婚的日子。这一天，王继先从工地回来，李芳云早在门口迎着他问：“任务完了吗？”
    “不但完成了任务，而且还得了模范呢。”王继先领导的小队，在十月红旗竞赛中获得了光荣的模范队的称号。
    邻居们听说他们今天要结婚，便都来帮助他们买肉、打酒，帮助他们欢迎客人。王继先还把节省下来的奖金，陪李芳云上百货公司化十七万元买了一双新皮鞋。
    忙碌了一阵以后，他们换上了自己的新衣裳，屋里却忽然显得沉寂起来。
        “咱们这样就算结婚呀。”
        “可不，咱们就这样结婚?。”
        “我说咱们怎么结婚呀？”
    这一问，可就把王继先愣住了。他想了一想，想出了一个主意。他说：“咱们挂张毛主席像，对他行个礼，好不好？”他的提议立刻得到了李芳云的同意。
    王继先和李芳云在毛主席的像前行了礼，他们就这样简单而又热烈地举行了他们的婚礼。
    结婚的第二天，王继先没有等休假期结束，就又回到了工地，因为他们的混凝土队，在十月份的下旬，就提前开始进行十一月份的工作了。（附图片）
