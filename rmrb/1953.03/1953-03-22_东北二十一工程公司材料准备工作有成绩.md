The Northeast Twenty-first Engineering Company had basically completed the preparation of all major materials by the end of last year.

After all engineering materials were ordered, the Transportation Section formulated a transportation plan based on engineering needs, contacted relevant transportation departments, and signed transportation contracts. The three million bricks needed for the first quarter have now been transported to the construction site, and the 3,800 cubic meters of sand are guaranteed to be delivered before construction begins. The annual transportation plans for other materials such as cement, lime, and timber have been submitted to the Railway Bureau, and some have already been delivered.

The company's main experiences in materials and transportation preparation are as follows: 1. Focus on preparing major and critical materials, and sign contracts as early as possible. 2. Appoint dedicated personnel or establish specialized agencies. For example, the Materials Section has a dedicated person responsible for ordering procurement contracts; the construction engineering team has a Materials Unit to strengthen material management. General materials can be resolved by the construction engineering team itself, so that material supply can be better combined with the needs of the site, reducing the possibility of capital backlog. 3. The materials department should be familiar with the engineering situation, strive for initiative, and help the planning department supplement deficiencies in the plan. For example, the original plan did not include the purchase of charcoal, but the Materials Section, based on past experience, estimated that 108 tons of charcoal would be needed this year, so it ordered it in advance, solving the needs of this spring's project. 4. Material transportation should be carried out as much as possible during the idle time before construction. In this way, transportation tools are easier to solve, and transportation before thawing is more convenient than after thawing. 5. Have a plan and check it regularly. Comrades who do material procurement work often have to go to other places, and a trip can take a long time. Therefore, when assigning tasks, the Materials Section must clearly determine: who does what, what purpose is to be achieved, when to complete it, and instruct those on official trips to contact the company frequently and check at any time. This strengthens the sense of responsibility of the materials personnel, improves work efficiency, and ensures the smooth completion of procurement tasks.

    东北二十一工程公司材料准备工作有成绩
    东北二十一工程公司在去年年底已基本上准备好了各项主要材料。
    在各项工程材料订妥以后，运输股就根据工程需要作出运输计划，和各有关运输部门取得联系，签订运输合同。第一季度所需的三百万块砖现已运到工地，三千八百立方公尺砂子也保证在开工前一定运到。其他如水泥、白灰和木材等的全年运输计划都已提交铁路局，现已运到一部分。
    该公司在材料、运输准备工作中，主要有下列几点经验：一、抓紧准备主要材料和关键材料，能订合同的就及早订好。二、指定专人或设立专门机构。如材料科专设一人负责订采购合同；施工工程队中设立材料股，加强材料管理，一般材料都可由施工工程队自己解决，这样材料供应就更能和现场工程需要结合，减少了积压资金的可能。三、材料部门要熟悉工程情况，争取主动，帮助计划部门补添计划的不足。如原计划上没有购买木炭这项内容，但材料科根据过去的经验，估计今年需要一百零八吨木炭，因此就先行订购，解决了今年春天工程的需要。四、材料的运输要尽量争取在施工之前的空闲时间进行，这样，运输工具既容易解决，解冻以前运输又比解冻以后方便。五、要有计划，要经常检查。做材料采购工作的同志常常要到外地去，一去就要很长的时间。因此，材料科在布置任务时一定要明确确定：谁做什么，达到什么目的，何时完成，并责成公出人员经常与公司联系，随时检查。这样就加强了材料人员的责任心，提高工作效率，保证采购任务的顺利完成。
