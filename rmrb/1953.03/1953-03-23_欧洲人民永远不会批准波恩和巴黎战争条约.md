    The People of Europe Will Never Approve the Bonn and Paris War Treaties
    Under the direction of his American masters, West German puppet Adenauer, ignoring the strong opposition of the German people and the people of Western European countries, forced the Bonn Federal Assembly to pass the so-called "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" agreement, which betray the national interests of Germany. Although Washington expressed satisfaction with this matter, in reality, the difficulties of the American war preparation plan in Western Europe have not been reduced as a result, and the crisis of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc will never be alleviated as a result.
    The Bonn and Paris war treaties, which rearm West Germany and organize the Western European aggressive bloc, have encountered numerous setbacks since they were signed under American planning in May of last year. In particular, the Paris war treaty, the so-called "European Defense Community" agreement, has not been dared to be ratified by the parliaments of the Western European puppet states due to the firm opposition of the people of each country. When the West German Federal Assembly conducted the second reading debate on the Bonn and Paris treaties in early December of last year, the West German people launched a surging tide of protest, so the United States had to instruct Adenauer to temporarily stop forcing the Federal Assembly to immediately pass the two war treaties in the third reading, and to negotiate with the Social Democratic Party, which was carrying the banner of the "opposition party," to wait for an opportunity to act. In other signatory countries, the people's protest movement has also been rising higher and higher, causing great obstacles to the American plan to organize a "European Army" and further deepening the crisis of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. In order to save this crisis, the new US Secretary of State Dulles had to rush to Western Europe at the beginning of this year, using various means of coercion and inducement to exert pressure on the puppet states, ordering the puppet states to ratify the "European Defense Community" agreement before April 20. Adenauer's rush to serve is undoubtedly the result of the United States strengthening its pressure. On Adenauer's side, he intends to use this matter to further please the United States in order to beg for more dollars; the United States' intention is to let West Germany serve as an "example" in order to urge other puppet countries to pass these treaties. But the United States' wishful thinking will never be so satisfactory. Even the politicians in Bonn believe that the actions of the Bonn parliament "do not necessarily ease the attitude of other signatory countries towards the decisions they are currently facing"; the so-called six-nation foreign ministers' meeting held previously did not reach a unanimous agreement on these war treaties, and the French parliament is now in a state of turmoil over the issue of "additional protocols," which more clearly shows the state of internal discord within the aggressive bloc.
    The reason why the United States is so eager to get the Western European puppet states to ratify the Bonn and Paris war treaties is because these two treaties are the main links in the American war preparation plan in Western Europe. As Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his report at the 19th Congress of the CPSU, "The characteristic of the strategy of American imperialism is that the American leaders build their war plans on the basis of using the territory and troops of other countries, first of all the troops of West Germany and Japan, as well as the troops of Britain, France, and Italy, that is, using the people of other countries to act as blind weapons and cannon fodder in the American monopoly capitalists' struggle for world hegemony according to the plans of American strategists." The United States attempts to use the "General Treaty" to ensure the open rearmament of West Germany, and to organize a Western European aggressive army with the revived Hitler Wehrmacht as its core and under American control through the "European Defense Community" treaty, in order to achieve its goal of using foreign territory and foreign troops to seize world domination. This sinister plan seriously damages the interests of the European people and threatens their safety. Therefore, both of these war treaties have been resolutely opposed by the people of Western Europe. The protests of the German people are particularly strong. In the German Democratic Republic, about 13 million people, and in West Germany, 15 million people, voted against the policy of rearming West Germany. This means that more than two-thirds of the adult German people have clearly expressed their opposition to the Bonn parliament's ratification of these two war treaties. When the Bonn parliament conducted the third reading of the Bonn and Paris treaties, the protest movement of the people of Western Europe reached a new climax. More than 3,000 people held demonstrations in Bonn, and the people of other parts of West Germany also expressed their resolute protest against the ratification of these two war treaties. On March 20, the People's Chamber and the Senate of the German Democratic Republic passed a joint statement calling on the German people to prevent the implementation of the Bonn and Paris war treaties. The statement also emphasized, on behalf of the general will of the entire German people: For the German people, the Bonn and Paris war treaties, which forfeit sovereignty and humiliate the country, are invalid. Building a peaceful and unified Germany is not only the unanimous desire of the entire German people, but also the unanimous desire of the people of European countries. At the International Conference for Peaceful Settlement of the German Question held in November of last year, representatives of the people of fourteen countries firmly expressed their support for the German people's struggle against military treaties, for a peaceful settlement of the German question, and for the conclusion of a peace treaty. The Bonn parliament's ratification of the Bonn and Paris war treaties will only arouse more courageous protest movements from the people of Western European countries. Regardless of whether the ruling groups of Western European countries will ratify the Bonn and Paris treaties, the people of Western European countries will never approve these war treaties. This dooms the inevitable failure of the American war preparation plan in Western Europe.

### 欧洲人民永远不会批准波恩和巴黎战争条约

专栏：短评

    欧洲人民永远不会批准波恩和巴黎战争条约
    西德傀儡阿登纳在他的美国主子指使之下，不顾德国人民和西欧各国人民的强烈反对，强使波恩联邦议院通过了出卖德国民族利益的所谓“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”协定。尽管华盛顿方面对这件事表示快慰，但是实际上美国的西欧备战计划的困难并没有因此而减少，北大西洋侵略集团的危机也决不会因此而缓和。
    重新武装西德和组织西欧侵略集团的波恩和巴黎战争条约，自从去年五月间在美国的策划之下签订以来，遇到了重重的挫折。特别是巴黎战争条约即所谓“欧洲防务集团”协定，由于各国人民的坚决反对，西欧各仆从国议会一直未敢予以批准。去年十二月初西德联邦议院对波恩和巴黎条约进行二读辩论的时候，西德人民掀起了汹涌的抗议怒潮，因此美国不得不授意阿登纳暂时停止强迫联邦议院立即三读通过这两项战争条约的活动，而与打着“反对党”招牌的社会民主党谈判，以待机行事。而在其他的签字国家中，人民的抗议运动也同样愈来愈高涨，使美国筹组“欧洲军”的计划遭到极大的障碍，进一步加深了北大西洋侵略集团的危机。为了挽救这一危机，新任美国国务卿杜勒斯不得不在今年年初刚上任的时候，就仓忙赶往西欧，用各种威迫利诱的手段，对各仆从国施行压力，勒令各仆从国必须在四月二十日以前批准“欧洲防务集团”协定。阿登纳的争先效命，无疑是美国加强压力的结果。在阿登纳方面，是打算用这件事情进一步讨好美国，以乞取更多美元；美国的打算则是企图让西德作个“榜样”，以便催促其他仆从国家通过这些条约。但是美国的这种如意算盘，是决不会这样如意的，连波恩的政客也认为波恩议会的行动“并不见得会缓和其他签字国对于目前所面临的决定态度”；前此举行的所谓西欧六国外长会议，并没有就这些战争条约取得一致的协议，法国的议会现在正为“附加议定书”的问题闹得不可开交，更明白地显示了侵略集团内部同床异梦的情状。
    美国所以急于要使西欧各仆从国批准波恩和巴黎战争条约，是因为这两个条约是美国在西欧准备战争计划的主要环节。正如马林科夫同志在联共第十九次代表大会上所作的报告中所指出的，“美帝国主义的战略的特点是：美国的头子们把自己的战争计划建立在利用他国领土和他国军队的基础上的，这首先是西德和日本的军队以及英国、法国和意大利的军队，也就是利用其他国家的人民，要他们按照美国战略家的计划，在美国垄断资本家争夺世界霸权的勾当中充当盲目的武器和炮灰。”美国企图利用“一般性条约”来确保公开重新武装西德，而通过“欧洲防务集团”条约组织以复活的希特勒国防军为核心并受美国控制的西欧侵略军队，以达到它利用外国领土和外国军队进行夺取世界统治的目的。这种罪恶的计划是严重地损害欧洲人民的利益和威胁他们的安全的。因此这两项战争条约都遭到西欧人民的坚决反对。德国人民的抗议尤其强烈，在德意志民主共和国约有一千三百万人，在西德有一千五百万人，投票反对重新武装西德的政策。这就是说，有三分之二以上成年的德国人民已明白表示反对波恩议会批准这两个战争条约。当波恩议会三读波恩和巴黎条约的时候，西欧人民的抗议运动达到了新的高潮，三千多人在波恩举行了示威，西德其他各地人民也纷纷表示坚决抗议批准这两个战争条约。三月二十日，德意志民主共和国人民议院和参议院通过一项联合声明，号召德国人民阻止实现波恩和巴黎战争条约。声明并代表全德人民的普遍意志着重指出：对于德国人民来说，丧权辱国的波恩和巴黎战争条约是无效的。建立和平、统一的德国，不仅是全德国人民的一致愿望，也是欧洲各国人民的一致愿望。在去年十一月召开的国际争取和平解决德国问题会议上，十四个国家人民的代表坚决表示支持德国人民反对军事条约、争取和平解决德国问题、争取缔结和约的斗争。波恩议会批准了波恩和巴黎战争条约，只会激起西欧各国人民更加勇猛的抗议运动。不管西欧各国的统治集团会不会批准波恩和巴黎条约，西欧各国的人民是永远不会批准这些战争条约的。这就注定了美国西欧备战计划的必然失败。
