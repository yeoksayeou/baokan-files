Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: The people of the whole country, through several years of exercise and education in democratic governance, have acquired preliminary experience in democratic elections. When people's representative conferences are held at all levels in various regions, the broad masses of the people actively participate in elections, earnestly elect representatives who can represent their will, and elect provincial, county, and township (village) people's government committees through these representatives, laying a good foundation for the implementation of universal suffrage and the convocation of local people's congresses and the National People's Congress.

According to available statistics, there are now more than 13,637,000 representatives to people's representative conferences at all levels across the country. In general areas, those directly or indirectly elected by the people have reached more than 80% of the total number of representatives, while those recommended and invited account for a very small number. Taking Shanxi Province, which was liberated earlier, as an example, according to the statistics of 55 counties (accounting for more than half of the province's counties), there are a total of 9,973 representatives, of which 90.2% were produced by elections, with Jincheng County reaching 97.2%. Jiangxi Province was liberated later, but in more than half of the province's counties, more than 80% of the representatives to the people's representative conferences at all levels were elected by the people. Sichuan is a province that was liberated very late, but in the people's representative conferences of Langzhong, Pingwu and other nine counties in the province, those produced by elections also account for more than 80% to 90% of the total number of representatives in each county.

In the process of political power construction, the political consciousness of the people of the whole country has been greatly improved. They value their democratic rights and actively participate in elections. When the people's representative conferences were first held, the masses of the people lacked experience in democratic elections, and some people had vague ideas about democratic elections. However, after holding several meetings, the people realized from the facts that democratic election is the people's democratic right, and they have gained experience in elections. Therefore, their political enthusiasm has been strengthened day by day, and they have actively participated in elections. When Beijing held the first session of the Fourth People's Representative Conference in August last year, the average participation rate of street residents in the election reached 80% of the total number of households. When the Fourth District of Taiyuan City held the first session of the Second People's Representative Conference, even the elderly who usually do not go out participated in the conference to elect representatives. The people are more active and serious about electing provincial governors, county heads, township heads, and government members. Hu Laowu, a farmer in Xinfacun Village, Panshi County, Jilin Province, heard that the county's people's representative conference was going to be held to elect the county head, and ran to the village people's government three times a day to inquire about when to elect representatives to go to the county to attend the meeting. In many places, the masses have taken over all the production work of the representatives in order to enable them to concentrate on the election. Some people in Hejian County, Hebei Province, went to the representatives' homes and said to them: "We will do whatever work you have, so that you can prepare to go to the county to attend the meeting and elect the county head." When the representative of Gaoxinzhuang Village went to the county to attend the meeting, more than 100 farmers in the village sent their representative to the district people's government and said to the representative: "You should carefully elect a good county head for us, and we will guarantee to do a good job in production to welcome you." More than 400 representatives in Xishui County, Hubei Province, including many elderly people, braved heavy snow to go to the county seat to attend the people's representative conference to elect the county head.

The people are very serious and prudent about democratic elections, and have the experience of exercising democratic rights. Many people say: "The election of representatives must be cautious, political power is the best weapon we use to fight against the enemy!" Therefore, everyone has a scale in mind when discussing candidates. A candidate surnamed Wen in a certain township in Rong County, Guangxi Province, had a "retreat" mentality after the land reform and did not do a good job for the masses. As a result, everyone did not elect him and elected a person surnamed Li as a representative instead. Not only are the voters serious, but the candidates are also very serious. In an election in Yong'an Street, Panshi County, Jilin Province last year, two candidates each introduced their model deeds during the election and each cast a vote for themselves when voting. When electing county heads, township heads, and government members, everyone repeatedly instructed the representatives when sending them to the meeting. When Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, held a people's representative conference to elect the county head, an old woman in Pingyang Township in the county held the representative's hand and said: "I have lived for 85 years and have changed several dynasties. I have never heard of the major event of electing the county head. You must choose carefully." Under the supervision of the masses, the representatives were very serious and careful about the election. In December 1951, Wu'an County, Hebei Province, held a people's representative conference to elect the county head, deputy county head, and government members. During the meeting, someone proposed Dr. Li Gensheng as a candidate for the government committee member, but many people believed that he did not accept apprentices and was unwilling to spread his family medical skills, and his selfish ideas were serious, so they did not agree to nominate him as a candidate. After Li Gensheng made a public and earnest self-criticism and promised to change his selfish ideas, everyone agreed to nominate him as a candidate. The representatives used various opportunities and various methods to understand the situation of the candidates: some inquired from relevant parties, such as a farmer representative in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, who ran to four or five agencies to inquire about the situation of the county head candidate Bao Guotang; many representatives in Minhou County, Fujian Province, did not understand the deputy county head candidate Wu Dianxuan, and all visited the delegation of the Twelfth District (Wu is from that district). Some carefully studied the candidates' materials, such as Qin Fajia, a representative from Huguan County, Shanxi Province, who took the candidates' materials for detailed interviews until he asked clearly before voting. In areas where ethnic minorities live together, the people often elect people from different ethnic groups who can actively work for everyone as representatives. When Xi'an held the third people's representative conference, more than 90% of the Han people in Jinglongchi in the Seventh District nominated Ma Dewu, a Hui Muslim who was enthusiastic about preferential treatment, as a candidate for representative.

The broad masses of the people often supervise the representatives they elect, and if they encounter incompetent or illegal representatives, they will remove them and elect others. A representative in Nanzheng City, Shaanxi Province, did not convey the spirit of the meeting after returning, and the masses said: "If you don't work for the people, don't elect him." Ding Jingfang, a resident representative of the Zhongshan District People's Representative Conference in Lushun City, was revoked of his representative qualification and Jiang Dingying was re-elected as a representative because of corruption. Individual cadres who did not show enough democratic style in the election or attempted to monopolize the election were severely criticized by the people and reported to higher authorities. In Changshan County, Zhejiang Province, due to the cadres' monopolization of the election, a person who the masses were not satisfied with was elected as a representative. The masses reported to the district people's government four times, demanding a re-election. Despite the heavy rain during the re-election, the masses insisted on not dispersing. A cadre in Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, arbitrarily cancelled a representative elected by the people and asked the masses to return to the village for re-election, which was not only opposed by the masses, but also punished by higher authorities. Because the people seriously and responsibly carried out the election and fully exercised their democratic rights, some incompetent representatives and government members were defeated in the election, and model figures and activists who emerged in various movements were largely elected. For example, 85 of the original representatives in Dunhua County, Jilin Province, were defeated in the re-election, and a vice chairman of the county standing committee was also defeated because of complacency and failure to earnestly convey the resolutions. In Shuangmiao Township, Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, three township people's government members were re-elected at the second township people's congress held in March last year because of their undemocratic style. The various model figures elected by the masses in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, account for 85% of the total number of representatives in the county.

After the people in various places elected provincial governors, county heads, township heads, and government members through democratic elections, the people felt that they had truly become the masters of the country, which greatly improved their political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm. After the people's representative conferences were held in the suburbs of Beijing in 1951 to elect district heads, more than 400,000 farmers in the suburbs launched a large-scale patriotic production increase and donation campaign, donating 3.2 billion yuan within half a month to purchase airplanes and artillery to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. After the people's representative conference was held in Licheng County, Shandong Province in November 1951 to elect the county head, deputy county head, and members of the county people's government, the farmers launched a winter production campaign, repairing more than 270 drainage ditches, sluice ditches, dams, and irrigation ditches, digging more than 1,300 wells, and digging more than 60 million catties of pit soil and dry well soil. Qinghe and Tantou townships in the county dug three ditches in two days after the township people's congress, which can irrigate more than 700 acres of land. The local farmers said happily: This major event could not be accomplished in the years before liberation, but it has now been accomplished in two days.

    全国人民经过民主建政工作锻炼
    已有行使民主权利的经验
    【新华社三日讯】全国人民经过几年来民主建政工作的锻炼和教育，已具有民主选举的初步经验。在各地举行各界人民代表会议时，广大人民积极参加选举，认真地选出能够代表他们意志的代表人物，并通过这些代表选举省、县、乡（村）各级人民政府委员会，为实行普选、召开地方各级人民代表大会和全国人民代表大会奠定了良好的基础。
    据现有材料统计：全国各级人民代表会议的代表现有一千三百六十三万七千多人，其中由人民直接选举或间接选举的，一般地区已经达到代表总数的百分之八十以上，推选和邀请的占极少数。以解放较早的山西省为例，据五十五县（占全省县数一半以上）的材料统计，共有代表九千九百七十三人，由选举产生的占总数百分之九十点二，其中晋城县达到百分之九十七点二。江西省解放较晚，但该省的半数以上的县，其各界人民代表会议的代表也都有百分之八十以上是由人民选举产生的。四川是很晚解放的一个省份，但该省阆中、平武等九个县各界人民代表会议的代表，由选举产生的也占各该县代表总数的百分之八十以上到九十以上。
    全国人民在政权建设过程中政治觉悟大大提高，重视自己的民主权利，积极参加选举。在最初举行各界人民代表会议时，人民群众还缺少民主选举的经验，有一部分人对民主选举还存在着模糊观念。但是在举行过几次会议后，人民群众从事实中认识到民主选举是人民的民主权利，并有了选举的经验，因此政治积极性一天比一天加强，踊跃参加选举。北京市去年八月举行第四届第一次各界人民代表会议时，街道居民参加选举的，平均占到总户数的百分之八十。太原市第四区举行第二届第一次各界人民代表会议时，连平时不出门的老年人都参加会议选举代表。人民群众对选举省主席、县长、乡长和政府委员，更积极认真。吉林省磐石县新发村农民胡老五听说要开县各界人民代表会议选举县长，曾一天三次跑到村人民政府去打听，询问甚么时候选举代表去县里开会。很多地方的群众为了使他们的代表能够安心选举，把代表的生产工作全部包了下来。河北省河间县有些群众跑到代表家里去对代表说：“你有甚么活，我们给你做，你好准备去县里开会选举县长。”该县高辛庄代表去县里开会时，庄上有一百多农民把他们的代表一直送到区人民政府，并向代表说：“你用心给咱们选个好县长，我们保证搞好生产来迎接你。”湖北省浠水县四百多个代表包括不少年纪很大的人，冒着大雪赶到县城去出席各界人民代表会议选举县长。
    人民群众对民主选举十分认真慎重，具备了行使民主权利的经验。许多人都这样说：“选代表可要慎重哩，政权是我们用来对敌人作斗争的最好的武器咧！”所以大家在讨论候选人的时候，心目中都有个尺度。广西省容县某乡有个姓温的候选人，他在土地改革后有“退坡”思想，没有好好替群众办事，结果大家都不选他，另选了个姓李的当代表。不仅选举的人认真，候选人也非常认真。吉林省磐石县永安街在去年的一次选举中，有两个候选人在竞选时都各自介绍了自己的模范事迹，投票时又各投了自己一票。遇到选举县长、乡长和政府委员时，大家在送代表去开会时都再三嘱咐。江西省广丰县召开各界人民代表会议选举县长时，该县屏阳乡有个老太婆拉着代表的手说：“我活了八十五岁，换了几个朝代，从没听过选举县长这件大事，你要好好选。”代表们在群众的督促下，对选举都很认真仔细。河北省武安县一九五一年十二月举行各界人民代表会议选举正副县长和政府委员。会中有人提出医生李根生为政府委员候选人，但很多人认为他不收徒弟不愿把家传医术传播开去，自私思想严重，因此不同意提他为候选人。在李根生当众痛切检讨，保证改变自私思想后，大家才同意提他为候选人。代表们用各种机会，采用多种多样的方式来了解候选人的情况：有的是向有关方面去打听，如山西省介休县一个农民代表曾跑了四、五个机关去打听县长候选人暴国唐的情况；福建省闽侯县很多代表对副县长候选人吴殿选不了解，都到第十二区（吴是该区人）代表团进行访问。有的仔细研究候选人的材料，如山西省壶关县代表秦发家拿着候选人的材料详细访问，直到问得清清楚楚，才投票选举。在民族杂居的地方，人民群众常常把不同民族、能积极为大家办事的人选作代表。西安市举行第三届各界人民代表会议时，第七区景龙池百分之九十以上的汉民把热心优抚工作的回民马德五提为代表候选人。
    广大人民群众对于自己选出的代表，经常进行监督，遇到有不称职或违法失职的代表，便将其撤换而另选别人。陕西省南郑市有个代表开会回去不传达，群众纷纷说：“不给人民办事，不要选他了。”旅大市中山区各界人民代表会议的居民代表丁景芳因为有贪污行为，选民便撤销了他的代表资格，改选姜鼎英当代表。个别干部在选举中表现民主作风不够或企图包办选举的，人民群众都予以严厉批评，并向上级检举。浙江省常山县由于干部包办选举，让一个群众不满意的人当了代表，群众四次到区人民政府揭发，要求改选，改选时虽遇大雨，群众都坚持不散。山东省寿张县某干部擅自取消了一个人民选举出来的代表，并要群众回村再选，不但遭到群众的反对，而且受到上级的处分。由于人民群众认真负责地进行选举，充分行使民主权利，一些不称职的代表和政府委员都落选了，模范人物和在各次运动中涌现出来的积极分子大量地当选了。例如吉林省敦化县原来的代表有八十五人在改选时落选，有一个县常务委员会副主席因为骄傲自满、不认真传达决议也落选。河南省襄城县双庙乡有三个乡人民政府委员，因为作风不民主，在去年三月举行第二届乡人民代表大会时便被改选掉了。浙江省萧山县由群众选举出来的各种模范人物，占该县代表总数的百分之八十五。
    各地经过民主选举，选出省主席、县长、乡长和政府委员后，人民群众感到自己真正成了国家的主人，大大提高了政治积极性和生产积极性。北京市郊各区一九五一年举行各界人民代表会议选举区长后，郊区四十多万农民开展了规模很大的爱国增产捐献运动，半个月内认捐三十二亿元购买飞机大炮支援中国人民志愿军。山东省历城县一九五一年十一月举行各界人民代表会议选举正副县长和县人民政府委员后，农民展开了冬季生产运动，修排水沟、闸水沟、水坝、灌溉沟共二百七十多条，打井一千三百多眼，挖坑土和旱井土六千多万斤。该县清河、滩头两乡在乡人民代表会议后，两天内就挖沟三条，可浇七百多亩地。当地农民群众高兴地说：这件大事，解放前几年都没有办成，现在两天就办成了。
