    North China Administrative Council Organs Improve Leadership Work
    Conduct Democratic Inspection to Oppose Bureaucracy

    [This Newspaper News] In order to improve leadership methods and leadership style, and achieve the goal of improving work efficiency, the organs of the North China Administrative Council universally carried out a mass democratic inspection work and a movement to oppose bureaucracy.

    At the beginning of the movement, Liu Lantao, Chairman of the North China Administrative Council, made a report on "Adjusting Organizational Structure and Improving Leadership Style," emphasizing that each department should, based on the experience of the work in 1952, formulate an organizational structure that conforms to reality. At the same time, in order to complete the arduous work tasks of 1953, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological leadership and resolutely oppose bureaucracy and red tape. All units mobilized the masses to discuss this report and, after proposing new staffing plans based on the principles of streamlining the organization and prioritizing key areas, launched a work inspection from the bottom up. Because the leadership of each unit repeatedly expressed their determination to support those who made suggestions, eliminating the concerns of some staff members about "retaliation" and worrying that "problems raised would not be solved," the enthusiasm and awareness of the masses were brought into play, and most problems could be "discussed deeply and thoroughly." Opinions that could not be heard in the past and problems that were not known were brought up, greatly clarifying the minds of leading cadres.

    As a result of the inspection, everyone raised the following opinions on leadership methods, leadership style, democratic life, cadre policy, learning, and life: First, there is a serious phenomenon of red tape in the work. Not only are there many documents issued, but there are also many internal levels and procedures, resulting in many delays and backlogs. For example, in the Industry Bureau, some documents had to go through nineteen procedures and be registered nine times to enter and exit the bureau; in the Trade Bureau, it took nine days to process urgent documents. Some units also handled documents without distinguishing responsibilities, pushing them down layer by layer; others made mistakes when issuing documents, such as the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau sending the Central Ministry of Agriculture's instructions on investigating conflicts between forestry and animal husbandry directly to Tianjin. Second, inspection work is somewhat blind. Sending people down to inspect work and request materials lacks unified organization and planning, leaving the lower levels exhausted in coping. Some units, after inspecting work or requesting materials, do not pay attention to research, and even materials are accumulated in the notebooks of cadres working in the countryside for a long time; others store the forms and reports urged by urgent documents in the archives, losing the role of investigation. Third, some units lack a clear central task and a comprehensive plan, with more sporadic deployments and less systematic inspection. At the same time, there are many meetings that take a long time, and some meetings cannot solve problems. Fourth, the democratic system is unsound, lacking sufficient criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from the bottom up. Some leading cadres also have a rigid attitude, with more criticism and less encouragement to subordinates, causing a gap in the relationship between leaders and the masses, and information from below cannot be conveyed in a timely manner. Fifth, in terms of cadre work, there is more use and less concrete assistance and education. A small number of old cadres are improperly used, and those who should be promoted have not been promoted; some college students have "inconsistent learning and application"; individual technical cadres have not been assigned to positions where they can use their skills. Sixth, in terms of administrative management, the cadres' living problems, such as housing, crowded dining, cultural entertainment, and medical treatment, have not been properly resolved. Although some are limited by objective conditions, no initiative has been taken to explain the situation.

    After extensive and in-depth inspection and exposure of shortcomings, most leading cadres conducted in-depth self-criticism on the opinions raised by everyone. This supervision role of fully mobilizing the masses to launch criticism not only improved the leadership work but also increased the enthusiasm of the masses. At present, the leading cadres of each unit are paying attention to listening to the opinions of the masses, strengthening the planning and organization of their work, so that the phenomenon of uneven busyness and leisure has been basically overcome, and communication between superiors and subordinates has become closer and more united. In order to consolidate the achievements of the democratic inspection work, the entire organization has proposed the following methods for improving work methods, meeting systems, and reporting systems, and has seen initial results. First, in terms of work methods, in order to completely overcome bureaucracy and red tape, first of all, strengthen inspection work. Inspection methods include leading cadres going down in person, sending people down, and this year each bureau chief and director should regularly go to the countryside and factories. Each unit should also draw a certain number of cadres to regularly conduct inspection work. In order to overcome the blindness in the inspection work, the persons in charge of each committee should, according to the inspection work plan, organize the inspection work force of each unit as much as possible. At the same time, each unit adopted a collective "brainstorming" office system. Every morning at 9:00, each office and section presents the issues that need to be reported to the leadership face-to-face to the heads of each committee, institute, department, bureau, and association. The heads also directly assign tasks when they have them. Each time, it should not exceed one hour at most. The committees hold meetings every two or three days. In this way, both the leaders and those being led feel that the work is proactive, and the phenomenon of randomly flying notes and layers of checkpoints transferring and accumulating documents has been initially corrected. In addition, all offices and sections, except for the secretarial department, have canceled the receiving and dispatching of documents. Second, in terms of working hours, general cadres work and rest on time, concentrate their energy on getting things done during office hours, and try to avoid working overtime. Third, in terms of meetings, administrative meetings and professional meetings must be well organized, fully prepared, documents issued in advance, reporters and speakers must be prepared in advance, meetings start and end on time. Prevent meetings from discussing without a focus, wasting time, and failing to effectively solve problems.

    华北行政委员会机关改进领导工作
    进行民主检查反对官僚主义
    【本报讯】为了改进领导方法与领导作风，达到提高工作效率的目的，华北行政委员会机关曾普遍地进行了一次群众性的民主检查工作和反对官僚主
    义的运动。
    运动开始时，华北行政委员会主席刘澜涛作了关于“调整组织机构，改进领导作风”的报告，强调提出：各部门要根据一九五二年工作中的经验，把机关编制订得合乎实际，同时为了完成一九五三年的各项艰巨的工作任务，必须加强政治思想领导，坚决反对官僚主义和文牍主义。各单位都发动群众讨论了这一报告，并按精简机构、重点配备的原则提出新的编制方案后，即自下而上地展开了工作检查。由于各单位领导上反复表明决心，为提意见的人撑腰，消除了部分工作人员怕“报复”和担心“意见提出解决不了问题”的顾虑，使群众的积极性、自觉性得到发挥，大部问题能“谈深、谈透”。过去有些不能听到的意见和不曾知道的问题提出了，使领导干部的头脑大为清醒。
    检查的结果，大家对领导方法、领导作风、民主生活、干部政策、学习及生活等方面，提出以下意见：一、工作中存在严重的文牍主义现象。不但发文多，而且内部层次多，手续多，造成许多拖延积压现象。如工业局部分文件出入局门要经十九道手续，登记九次；贸易局处理急件，有的费时九天。还有些单位处理文件不分职责，层层下推；也有在发文时发生错误，如农林局把中央农业部调查林牧矛盾问题的指示照发天津市。二、检查工作带有盲目性。派人下去检查工作和要材料，缺乏统一的组织和计划，使下级穷于应付。有些单位检查工作或要来材料后，领导干部不重视研究，甚至材料长期积压在下乡干部的笔记本上；有的则把用急件催来的表报存入档案，失去调查的作用。三、有些单位中心工作不明确，缺乏通盘计划，零星布置多，系统检查少，同时开会多，时间长，有些会议还不能解决问题。四、民主制度不健全，缺乏充分的批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。也有些领导干部态度生硬，对下级批评多，鼓励少，使领导与群众关系发生隔阂，下情不能及时上达。五、干部工作方面，单纯使用多，具体帮助少，教育少。老干部有少数使用不当，该提拔未提拔；有些大学生
    “学用不一致”；个别技术干部未安排到能发挥其技术的岗位上。六、行政管理方面，对干部的生活问题，如住房、吃饭拥挤、文化娱乐及疾病治疗等未能妥善解决。有的虽限于客观条件困难，但亦未主动进行解释工作。
    经过广泛深入检查和揭发缺点后，多数领导干部就大家提出的意见，进行了深入的检讨。这种充分发挥群众展开批评的监督作用，不仅使领导工作得到改进，而且使群众的积极性有了提高。目前，各单位领导干部都注意了经常倾听群众意见，加强了工作上的计划性与组织性，使忙闲不均的现象基本上得到克服，上下通气，更加团结。为了巩固民主检查工作的成果，全机关并就工作方法、会议制度、报告制度等方面，提出如下的改进方法，并已初步见到效果。第一、在工作方法上，为了彻底克服官僚主义和文牍主义，首先，加强检查工作。检查方法包括领导干部亲自下去，派人下去，今年每个局长、主任都应定期下乡、下厂，各单位并应抽出一定数量的干部经常作检查工作。为了克服检查工作当中的盲目性，各委负责人应根据检查工作计划，将各单位检查工作的力量，尽量加以必要的组织。同时，各单位采取了集体“碰头”办公的制度。每天上午九时各处、室将需要向领导方面请示的问题，到各委、院、厅、局、会首长处当面提出，首长有任务亦直接交代。每次时间至多不超过一小时。各委则两三日举行一次。这样，领导和被领导都感到工作主动，初步纠正了乱飞纸条和层层关口辗转积压文件的现象。此外，各处、科除秘书部门外，一律取消收发。第二、在作息时间上，一般干部都按时作息，集中精力在办公时间内把事情办好，尽量避免加班加点。第三、在会议方面，行政会议和专业会议均须作好周密的组织工作，充分准备，事先印发文件，报告人和发言人预先得准备好，按时开会，按时散会。防止会议讨论无中心，拖延时间，不能有效地解决问题。
