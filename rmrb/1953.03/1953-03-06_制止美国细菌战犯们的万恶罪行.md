Stop the Heinous Crimes of the American Bacteriological Warfare Criminals
Former Judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Mei Ru'ao

For over a year, the American aggressors have continuously and on a large scale used bacteriological weapons on the Korean battlefield and on our territory, slaughtering Korean and Chinese military and civilians. This despicable and shameless behavior is the most blatant and barbaric violation of international law and international conventions, constituting the most serious and egregious war crime under international law. As everyone knows, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 stipulate the prohibition of "poisons" and "poisonous weapons," which undoubtedly includes bacteria and bacteriological weapons. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 explicitly declared the use of bacteriological weapons to be an illegal crime. These documents have been signed and ratified by the vast majority of countries around the world, and have long formed basic principles recognized and adhered to by civilized humanity in international law. However, in an attempt to salvage their irretrievable defeat, the American aggressors completely disregarded these basic principles stipulated in international law and international conventions. Since January of last year, they have carried out countless bacteriological warfare attacks in the front lines and rear areas of Korea, as well as in the peaceful cities and villages of our Northeast, attempting to massively slaughter the Korean and Chinese People's forces and peaceful residents. Undoubtedly, this inhumane atrocity by the American aggressors constitutes an extremely serious and extremely despicable war crime of "violation of the rules of war" and "violation of humanity" under international law. The severity and baseness of these crimes are not only appalling but also unprecedented.

The bloody crimes of the American aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare have grossly violated the basic principles of international law, which are recognized and adhered to by all countries in the world, and are absolutely intolerable to the conscience and capabilities of all civilized human beings. Regarding this point, even the American airmen who participated in the bacteriological warfare cannot help but recognize it. In the recently published "Main Testimony" of Colonel Schweibeler, Chief of Staff of the 1st Air Wing of the US Marine Corps, he said: "Every officer was shocked and ashamed when he first heard that the United States was using bacteriological warfare in Korea." "None of us believed that bacteriological warfare had any place in war because, of all the weapons designed, only bacteriological warfare has the primary goal of causing casualties among the civilian population -- and this is something that everyone knows in their conscience is completely wrong. The spread of disease is unpredictable, and a fully developed epidemic can be boundless. Furthermore, secretly using a weapon against unarmed people without prior warning gives one a terrible feeling of insidiousness and injustice." "Morally, it is a sin of eternal damnation in itself"; "From the standpoint of self-esteem and loyalty, it is shameful."
    "Everyone had the same feeling when they first heard (note: referring to bacteriological warfare), and their reaction was exactly what the people of an honest and self-respecting country would have."

We believe that, except for a small group of monopoly capitalists and war profiteers and a few lackeys who rely on them to get promoted and make a fortune, the vast majority of the American people are honest and self-respecting. If they were to learn the truth about America's bacteriological warfare, they would rise up to oppose and stop the crimes of the bacteriological warfare criminals. This is the main reason why the reactionary ruling clique in the United States uses extremely strict "security measures" to conceal their bloody crimes. As Schweibeler's testimony states:
    "It is generally agreed that the secrecy in this matter, as in normal cases, is more important to prevent our own people (note: referring to the American side) from knowing than to conceal the facts from the enemy (note: referring to the Chinese and Korean sides)." Because "since the B-29s carried out the germ warfare earlier, many drivers have become prisoners of war, so by now the enemy (referring to the Chinese and North Korean side) must already know that bacteriological warfare has been used."

Indeed, the Chinese and Korean sides not only "know" it, but we have also collected countless evidence to prove that the US military has indeed carried out this criminal war on a large scale on our territory. Personally, as early as March of last year, after I participated in the "Investigative Group on the Crimes of American Imperialism in Bacteriological Warfare" and conducted a half-month on-the-spot investigation, I was deeply convinced of the bloody crimes of the American invading forces. During those two weeks, we inspected twenty-one sites, collected many pieces of evidence, and listened to countless testimonies. What I remember most vividly was the scene when we went to inspect the area on the north bank of the Yalu River on the morning of March 18. The area on the north bank of the Yalu River is the area most frequently invaded by American planes (in Andong, Kuandian, and other counties, we heard air raid sirens more than three times a day on average), and it is also the place where they spread the most poisonous germs and insects. There, we saw and caught many dead and live poisonous insects on the ice and snow, including flies, mosquitoes, spiders, and black springtails. When brought back to the laboratory for examination, it was found that these insects contained pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis, Pasteurella, and typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli. In such a climate, in such a place, such a large number and variety of insects carrying pathogens appeared, and these insects were dense and clustered! Can we find any other explanation other than being spread by American planes?

This is just one of the examples we witnessed during our on-site investigation. The examples we heard and saw, as well as the direct and indirect strong evidence we collected, are innumerable. In short, after returning to Beijing in early April last year, I had already regarded the bloody act of bacteriological slaughter by the American aggressors as an ironclad case, with no room for doubt. In my open letter to the ten fellow judges of the former International Military Tribunal for the Far East on April 5 last year, which exposed and confirmed the crimes of the American aggressors, I said: "If an international court is organized one day to try the war criminals who conducted bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, I am willing to appear before the court as a witness."

However, there are many witnesses to the towering crimes of the American bacteriological warfare criminals, and they are all extremely powerful. Following our investigation team, many famous people from various countries went to the scene to conduct on-the-spot investigations, including Reverend Johnson and Mrs. Felton of the United Kingdom, Mr. Fach of France, and Reverend W.Y. Chun of Canada. They all unanimously confirmed and vigorously exposed this towering crime of the American aggressors in their respective countries. The two reports and many attachments submitted by the American War Crimes Investigation Group dispatched by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and the International Scientific Committee organized by world-renowned scientists from six countries after on-site investigation and research, more precisely proved this inhumane fact committed by the American aggressors. These witnesses and documents are extremely powerful evidence, and even from the perspective of Anglo-American traditional evidence jurisprudence, their value is enormous.

But even more powerful evidence is the confessions of those American air force prisoners of war who personally carried out the task of dropping germ bombs, these people's voluntary statements. It is direct, first-hand evidence of America's bacteriological warfare crimes, and therefore absolutely decisive evidence. Since the confessions of Lieutenant Eniak, Lieutenant Quinn of the 3rd Bombardment Wing, and Lieutenant O'Neill and Lieutenant Kness of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group of the US Air Force were published last year, those who previously doubted or were skeptical that the US government would fall to such a point have also believed that the American aggressors have indeed carried out this bloody act. The recent publication of the three confessions of American senior Air Force officer Schweibeler and the confession of Ordnance Officer Bligh allows the world to clearly see every step of America's criminal bacteriological warfare from planning to implementation. As the British "Daily Worker" said on February 24: "Anyone who reads these clear, concise confessions that include many specific details will immediately believe that this is something that experienced senior figures who are accustomed to planning complex military operations can say." These confessions of US Air Force officers reveal every step and every detail of the inside truth of America's bacteriological warfare, as well as the sinister ugliness and malicious tricks of the bacteriological war criminals. Today, I believe that no honest person in the world will have the slightest doubt about this towering crime of the US government!

Faced with these confessions of US Air Force officers, as well as the various ironclad evidence continuously presented by international figures and the Chinese and Korean people, the US government and military authorities have consistently failed to produce any factual counter-evidence or rebuttal. Their only "magic weapon" is to deny it outright. In a state of panic and embarrassment, they had to shamelessly fabricate a few sentences, saying that these accusations were "fabricated" by the Chinese and Korean sides; or they reluctantly stated against their conscience, "Our troops have never used bacteriological warfare." For more than a year, senior authorities of the reactionary ruling group in the United States, from Truman to Clark, have used such worthless "magic weapons" to cover up their towering crimes. I remember when "Plague General" Ridgway was transferred from commander of the US forces in the Far East to commander of the US forces in Europe last June, he was pressed by reporters in Italy and became anxious, and he could only point to the sky and swear: "God can testify that I declare that no unit under this command (referring to the US Forces Korea Command) has ever conducted bacteriological warfare at any time." According to Schweibeler's confession, it was none other than this hypocritical and shameless "Plague General" Ridgway who, in October 1951, accepted instructions from the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, issued orders, and presided over the execution of the bacteriological warfare mission.

The shamelessness of the current commander of the US forces in the Far East, Clark, is exactly the same as that of his predecessor Ridgway. Faced with the confessions of Schweibeler and Bligh, Clark could not produce any facts to deny or refute them. He could only follow the example of his predecessor, brazenly and against his conscience, repeating a cliché like Ridgway's, saying that the US military "has not engaged in bacteriological warfare in Korea or anywhere else, or any other form of warfare that could be mistaken for bacteriological warfare." Clark did not dare to deny even a single point, not even a single letter, of all the facts, place names, names, serial numbers, dates, etc. mentioned in the confessions of Schweibeler and Bligh. The reason is simple: those confessions mentioned completely irrefutable ironclad facts!

"Facts speak louder than words." In the face of mountains of ironclad facts, those heinous bacteriological war criminals now seem to be unable to say anything except repeat a few clichés and routinely slander us in ways that people are already tired of hearing. This is the tragedy of the bacteriological war criminals! They are now gradually realizing that their towering crimes have not only been discerned by the people of other countries around the world, but are also gradually being known to their own American people, not only arousing angry protests from the people of the world, but also beginning to arouse opposition from the American people. Their "security measures" have failed, and their deceptive policies have proven to be completely futile.

However, for the sake of the excess war profits of a small group of monopoly capitalists on Wall Street, the war profiteers of the reactionary ruling group in the United States continue to conduct bacteriological warfare, regardless of the protests of honest people around the world. This requires continuous and expanded exposure of their crimes, and the mobilization of all peace-loving and righteous people in all countries of the world, especially the United States, to unite and stop them. This will be a serious test for the current Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly: if it still wants to contribute to world peace and humanitarian justice, it must immediately take effective measures to resolutely stop this crime of the US government, and should no longer be an accomplice to American crimes. All honest legal workers around the world have a responsibility to stand up to stop American bacteriological warfare crimes in order to uphold the dignity of international law and humanitarian justice.

Here, we must solemnly warn those American culprits who planned and launched the bacteriological warfare that your inhumane acts will be subject to the most severe legal sanctions. The just war of the Chinese and Korean people will surely win the final victory. No matter where you flee to the ends of the earth, you will eventually be brought to justice and judged by the people.

    制止美国细菌战犯们的万恶罪行
    前远东国际军事法庭法官　梅汝璈
    美国侵略者一年多以来在朝鲜战场和我国领土上连续地大规模地使用细菌武器，屠杀朝中军民，这种卑鄙无耻的行为是对国际公法和国际公约最粗暴最野蛮的破坏，构成国际法上最严重最恶劣的战争犯罪。正如大家所知道的：一八九九年和一九○七年的海牙公约规定禁用“毒物”和“有毒武器”，无疑地包括细菌和细菌武器在内。一九二五年的日内瓦议定书更明文宣布了使用细菌武器是违法的罪行。这些文件是全世界极大多数国家所签订和批准的，在国际法上早已形成了文明人类所公认的和共守的基本原则。但是美国侵略者为了妄图挽救它不能挽救的失败，却完全不顾这些国际法和国际公约上所规定的基本原则，自去年一月起便在朝鲜前线和后方以及我国东北和平城乡肆无忌惮地进行了无数次的细菌战，企图大规模地屠杀朝中人民部队和和平居民。毫无疑义，美国侵略者的这种灭绝人性的暴行，在国际法上构成了极端严重、极端卑劣的“破坏作战法规”和“违反人道”的战争犯罪，其严重卑劣的程度不但骇人听闻，而且是史无前例的。
    美国侵略者进行细菌战的血腥罪行，粗暴地破坏了世界各国所公认和共守的国际法基本原则，是全体文明人类的良知良能所绝对不允许的。关于这一点，连参加细菌战的美国空军人员都不能不有所认识。在最近公布的美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长许威布尔上校的“主要供词”里，他说：“每一个军官在第一次听说美国正在朝鲜使用细菌战时，都是既震惊又羞惭。”“我们之间没有一人相信，在战争中细菌战有任何地位，因为在一切设计出来的武器中，只有细菌战是以在平民大众中制造伤亡为主要目标的——而这是每一个人在良心上都知道是彻底错误的。疾病的蔓延是不可预测的，一个充分展开了的流行病，可能是漫无边际的。此外，偷偷地以一种武器来对付赤手空拳、而又事先未获警告的人民，令人有一种可怕的阴毒和不公正的感觉。”“从道义上说，它本身就是永劫不复之罪”；“从自尊和忠诚的观点来说，它是可耻的。”
    “每人在第一次听说（按：指细菌战）的时候，都有同样的感觉，而他们的反应也正是一个正直和自尊的国家的人民所可能有的反应。” 
    我们相信：除了一小撮垄断资本家和战争贩子以及少数靠他们升官发财的奴仆走狗之外，极大多数的美国人民都是正直、自尊的。倘使他们获悉了美国进行细菌战的真相，他们是会起来反对和制止细菌战犯们的罪行的。这便是美国反动统治集团所以要用极端严格的“保密措施”来掩饰他们这个血腥罪行的主要原因。正如许威布尔的供词上所说：
    “一般都同意，在这件事上的保密，正和通常情况
    一样，更重要的是避免使我们（按：指美方）自己的人知道，而不是对敌人（按：指中朝方面）隐蔽事实”。因为“自从B—29型飞机早先进行了细菌战以来，许多驾驶员已成为战俘，因此，到现在敌人（按指中朝方面）一定已经知道使用了细菌战。”
    诚然，中朝方面不但早已“知道”了，而且我们早已收集了无数的证据，证实了美军确已在我们领土上大规模地进行了这种罪恶战争。就我个人来说，早在去年三月间我参加“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”作了半个月实地调查归来以后，我对美国侵略军的这个血腥罪行便已深信不疑。在那半个月里，我们视察了二十一个现场，搜集了许多的证物，听取了无数的证词。最使我难忘的便是三月十八日早晨我们到鸭绿江北岸一带去视察的那一幕。鸭绿江北岸一带是美国飞机最常侵犯的地区（在安东、宽甸等县平均每天要听到三次以上的空袭警报），也是他们撒布毒菌昆虫最多的场所。在那里，我们在冰雪上看到了也捕到了许多死的和活的毒虫，其中有苍蝇、蚊子、蜘蛛和黑跳虫。带回到实验室来检查，发现这些昆虫所含带的病菌有炭疽杆菌、巴士德属杆菌、伤寒和副伤寒杆菌。在这样的气候，在这样的地方，居然出现了这样大量的和多种的含带病菌的昆虫，而且这些昆虫是密集的、成群的！除了是由美国飞机所撒布以外，我们还能找得到任何别的解释吗？
    这不过是我们在实地调查中亲眼所见的事例之
    一。我们耳闻目睹的事例以及我们所收集的直接间接的有力证据，是不可胜数的。总之，在去年四月初间回到北京以后，我对美国侵略者进行细菌屠杀的血腥勾当早已认为是铁案，没有丝毫怀疑的余地。在去年四月五日我写给前远东国际军事法庭十个法官同僚的那封揭露并证实美国侵略者罪行的公开信里，我说：“假使异日组织一个国际法庭来审讯此次在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的战犯，我愿意以一个证人的资格出现于法庭之前。”
    然而，对美国细菌战犯们的滔天罪行的证人是很多的，而且他们都是异常有力的。继我们调查团之后，去到现场实地调查的有许多来自各国的著名人士，其中包括英国的约翰逊教长、费尔顿夫人，法国的法奇先生，加拿大的文幼章牧师。他们都一致证实了、并在他们国内竭力揭露了美国侵略者的这
    一滔天罪行。由国际民主法律工作者协会所派遣的美军战罪调查团和由六个国家的世界闻名的科学家所组织的国际科学委员会在现场调查研究之后所提出的两个报告书及许多附件，更是绝对精确地证明了美国侵略者所进行的这一灭绝人性的事实。这些证人和证件都是极端有力的证据，即使就英美传统的证据法学的观点来说，它们的价值都是巨大的。
    但是更有力的证据是那些亲自执行投掷细菌弹任务的美国空军战俘们的供词，这些人的自愿的陈述。是对美国进行细菌战罪行的直接的第一手的证据，因而也就是有绝对决定性的证据。从去年所发表的美国空军第三轰炸机联队伊纳克中尉、奎恩中尉和第十八战斗轰炸机大队的奥尼尔中尉、克尼斯中尉四个人的供词相继发表之后，那些以往怀疑或半信半疑美国政府竟会堕落到这样地步的人们，也都相信美国侵略者确实进行了这种血腥勾当。最近发表的美国高级空军军官许威布尔的三篇供词和军械官布莱的一篇供词，更使全世界可以清楚地看到美国这个罪恶的细菌战从计划到实施的每一个步骤。正如二月二十四日的英国“工人日报”所说：“任何人读了这些明确扼要而包括许多具体细节的供词，立刻就会相信，这是一向惯于计划复杂的军事行动的干练的高级人物才能说得出来的。”美国空军军官的这几篇供词把美国进行细菌战的内幕真相的每一步骤、每一细节，以及细菌战犯们的阴险丑态和恶毒伎俩，都和盘托出了。到了今天，我相信：世界上任何正直的人士再也不会对美国政府的这个滔天罪行有丝毫怀疑了！
    面对这些美国空军军官的供词，以及国际人士和中朝人民所继续不断地提出的种种铁证，美国政府和军事当局始终提不出任何事实上的反证或辩驳。他们惟一的“法宝”便是矢口抵赖。在惊慌失措、狼狈不堪的情形之下，他们只得恬不知耻地胡诌几句，说这些控诉是中朝方面“伪造”的；他们或是背着良心勉强声明一下，“我们的军队从来没有使用过细菌战”。一年多以来，美国反动统治集团的高级当局，自杜鲁门到克拉克，就是用这样一文不值的“法宝”去掩饰他们的滔天罪行的。记得“瘟疫将军”李奇微去年六月间由远东美军统帅调为欧洲美军统帅的时候，他在意大利被新闻记者们追问得发了急，只有指天誓日地说：“上帝可以为证，我声明该司令部（按指侵朝美军总司令部）所属的任何一个单位都没有在任何时候进行过细菌战。”根据许威布尔的供词，在一九五一年十月接受华盛顿参谋长联席会议的指示，颁布命令和主持执行细菌战任务的不是别人，而正是这位虚伪无耻的“瘟疫将军”——李奇微。
    现在的远东美军统帅克拉克的无耻，是和他的前任李奇微完全一样的。面对着许威布尔和布莱的供词，克拉克提不出任何事实去否定或反驳。他只有效法他的前任，厚着脸皮、昧着良心，重复一句李奇微式的滥调，说美国军队“没有在朝鲜或者任何其他地方进行过细菌战或者可能被误认为细菌战的任何其他方式的战争。”对于许威布尔和布莱的供词里所举的一切事实、地名、人名、番号、日期等等克拉克连一点都不敢否认，甚至连一个字母也不敢更正。理由很简单：那些供词里所举的完全是无可辩驳的铁般的事实！
        “事实胜于雄辩”。在堆积如山的铁般事实的面前，那班万恶不赦的细菌战犯们现在除了重复几句滥调和对我们照例进行些人们早已听厌了的毁谤之外，似乎连什么都说不出来了。这是细菌战犯们的悲哀！他们现在也逐渐明白：他们的滔天罪行不但为全世界其他国家的人民所洞悉，而且逐渐为他们自己美国人民所知晓，不但引起了全世界人民的愤怒抗议，而且已经开始引起美国人民的反对。他们的“保密措施”已经失效，他们的欺骗政策被证明完全是徒劳的。
    但是，为了华尔街一小撮垄断资本家的超额战争利润，美国反动统治集团的战争贩子们不顾全世界正直人士的抗议，仍在继续进行细菌战。这便需要继续地扩大地揭露他们的罪行，并动员世界各国特别是美国的一切爱好和平和有正义感的人民，一致起来加以制止。这对于现在正在开会的联合国七届大会，将是一个严重的考验：倘使它仍想对世界和平和人道正义有所贡献的话，它便不能不立即采取有效的措施，坚决制止美国政府这一罪行，而不应再作美国罪恶行为的帮凶。全世界正直的法律工作者，都有责任为维护国际法和人道正义的尊严而站出来制止美国细菌战罪行。
    在这里，我们必须郑重警告那些策划和发动细菌战争的美国罪魁，你们这种灭绝人性的勾当，必将受到最严厉的法律制裁。中朝人民的正义战争必将获得最后的胜利，不论你们逃到天涯海角，终要归案受人民的审判。
