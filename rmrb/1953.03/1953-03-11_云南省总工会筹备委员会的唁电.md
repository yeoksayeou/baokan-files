Condolences from the Preparatory Committee of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions

To the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions:

The unfortunate news of the passing of our most beloved revolutionary teacher, Comrade Stalin, fills us with infinite sorrow. This is a great loss for the working people of the world. We, the entire working class of Yunnan Province, are determined to transform grief into strength, forever follow the teachings of the great teacher Comrade Stalin, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, intensify our study of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, build our great motherland, unite even more closely with the Soviet people, and strive to further develop the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and to defend the cause of world peace and democracy.
