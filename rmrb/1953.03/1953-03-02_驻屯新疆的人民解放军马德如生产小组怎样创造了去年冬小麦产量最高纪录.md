Editor's note: This article is compiled based on the investigation report made by the "People's Liberation Army Unit Wheat High-Yield Investigation Team" composed of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Department, the Production Office of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and other units. The field management experience of the Ma Deru team's winter wheat and the spirit of closely combining local conditions, improving technology, and fighting against nature are all worth learning.

The Ma Deru production team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the north bank of the Kaidu River in Xinjiang planted 125.82 mu of winter wheat in the autumn of 1951, with an average yield of 462.14 jin per mu; among them, there were 10.78 mu of high-yield land, with an average yield of 1377.11 jin per mu (wheat contains 1.1% impurities and 98% dryness). This is the highest record of wheat yield per unit area in China in 1952.

The Ma Deru team's cultivated land is located in the grassland area on the north bank of the Kaidu River in Yanqi District. The Bosten Lake is located in the south of the grassland, with a width of 40 li and a length of more than 200 li, so the groundwater level is relatively high. Although rainfall is relatively scarce (according to the records from August 1951 to July 1952, the annual rainfall is only 37 mm), there is a sufficient amount of Kaidu River water (average flow of 100 cubic meters per second) for irrigation. The local area is a perennial grassland (tall and dense reeds grow everywhere, with an average height of more than 5 meters), so the soil structure of the newly reclaimed land is good and contains rich organic matter, which is a more favorable condition for local agricultural production. The unfavorable conditions are that the land contains alkali and must be soaked and washed before cultivation; there are frequent winds in spring, so it is necessary to prevent wheat lodging; the temperature is low, so it is necessary to prevent wheat seedlings from being damaged by frost. Local farmers only cultivate spring wheat, believing that winter wheat cannot be grown locally. Since the People's Liberation Army troops were stationed there, they began to try to grow winter wheat in 1950; however, due to the fact that the cultivation techniques were not mastered, it completely failed. The Ma Deru team learned from the failure and re-tried planting in the autumn of 1951, and achieved a bumper harvest in 1952. This broke the local farmers' conservative notion that winter wheat could not be grown locally, and played a huge role in expanding the winter wheat cultivation area.

The basic reason why the Ma Deru team achieved high yields is that they grasped every major link in wheat high yield. The factors affecting crop production are extremely complex, from the natural factors of climate and soil to the man-made factors of labor organization, from the soil management of the previous crop to the appropriate application of tillage techniques of the current crop, all of which are related to the high yield of crops. In the process of managing high-yield land, the Ma Deru team showed great enthusiasm for work, gave full play to the efficiency of collective labor, and were able to flexibly grasp and apply a series of yield-increasing factors.

I. Learning from Failure, Mastering Scientific Techniques

After the spring wheat was harvested in August 1951, the Ma Deru team used the Soviet "Bobo-28" plow to cultivate the land on August 14. No harrowing was done after plowing to enhance soil weathering. A large amount of water was irrigated once on August 21. This irrigation was to supply the seeds with the needs for germination and the development of seedlings before winter watering. On August 28, deep plowing was carried out once, with a depth of 18 cm. After plowing and slightly drying, harrowing was carried out immediately. The harrow used was the Soviet "zigzag harrow," and the drag was the local soil drag.

They sowed on September 2, 1951. At that time, the method of measuring whether the soil moisture was suitable for sowing was to randomly grab a handful of soil, hold it tightly by hand to form a ball, and then throw it down. If it could disperse, it was considered suitable. The sowing amount was 14 jin per mu. The sowing tool was a three-legged pendulum drill, with a row spacing of 20 cm and a sowing width of 3 cm, and a sowing depth of 7 to 8 cm. After sowing, the land was immediately dragged to cover the soil, and the land was rolled with a stone roller (a ribbed stone roller with a diameter of 30 cm and a length of 1.5 meters) one day later, so that the seeds could be closely connected with the soil particles and easily absorb moisture when the seeds germinated. Rolling one day later was to allow the surface soil to dry slightly. After rolling, the soil particles were compact and the soil would not stick to the roller and reduce the rolling effect.

The wheat seeds in the high-yield land were "Kuche White Awn Wheat" introduced from Kuche. The biggest feature of this variety is that it does not shatter, and it is resistant to fertilizer and has strong stalks. According to the observation records of the high-yield team, the plant height of this variety is about 1.4 meters, there are about 670 ears per square meter, the ear length is about 10 cm, each ear has an average of 19 spikelets, each spikelet has an average of two grains, and the grains are neat and full (there are 12,825 grains per jin). Their ability to achieve high yields is closely related to the selection of excellent varieties.

Before sowing, they used a Soviet grading and selection machine to select the seeds. The first-grade and second-grade seeds separated by the selection machine were large and full, and the admixtures (such as small soil particles, grass clippings, glumes, and shriveled wheat grains, etc.) were all removed. The use of such clean seeds guaranteed a high germination rate. According to the results of the seed germination test conducted by the high-yield team before sowing, the germination rate was over 96%. Therefore, there was no lack of seedlings in the high-yield land, and the seedlings grew vigorously, ensuring a certain density per unit area.

The question of whether winter wheat can overwinter is a key issue in local winter wheat planting. The lowest temperature in the local area in 1951 was minus 19.5 degrees Celsius; in addition, there was no snow in winter, and wheat seedlings were prone to freezing to death because there was no snow cover. They summarized the reasons for past failures, mainly in three points: one was that the sowing was not timely, one was that the winter watering was not appropriate, and one was that the sowing was too shallow. In 1950, they had planted winter wheat on this high-yield land, and the sowing date was October 3, leaving only more than 20 days before freezing. The wheat roots did not take deep root before freezing; in addition, too much winter water was irrigated, forming an ice layer on the ground, and the sowing depth was shallow. As a result, all the seedlings froze to death during the overwintering period. After this blow, some team members lost confidence in planting winter wheat in this area. However, everyone made careful research on the causes of frost damage, and finally found the suitable time for sowing winter wheat in this area. This period is determined by two factors: on the one hand, after the seedlings emerge, there must be enough time, and enough temperature and sunshine, for the wheat seedlings to take root and tiller before the soil freezes; on the other hand, the sowing should not be too early, otherwise, the seedlings will easily grow vigorously before freezing and are susceptible to frost damage. The experience of the high-yield team proves that early September is the suitable sowing period for winter wheat in the local area. Because at this time there are about 50 days before the soil freezing period, which allows the seedlings to complete root development.

Since the local winter temperature is low and there are no favorable climate conditions for snowfall, in addition to paying attention to the sowing date, another way to prevent seedlings from freezing to death is to water the winter. The timing of winter watering should also be appropriate, so that the water can all seep into the soil before the soil freezes. According to the team's experience, if the winter water is irrigated properly, the soil contains an appropriate amount of water, which can reduce soil temperature changes. In 1951, the winter watering date for the high-yield land was October 20, about 10 days before the soil freezing period. Because they mastered the watering period and the amount of watering, combined with the appropriate sowing period and sowing depth that they had explored, they were able to plant winter wheat in areas where only spring wheat could be grown in the past, and safely survived the severe winter.

After the soil thawed in the spring, they rolled it once on March 18 and loosened the soil once on April 21. At the time of loosening the soil, the weeds had just emerged two or three centimeters above the ground. This loosening of the soil had three effects: first, to reduce soil moisture evaporation; second, to increase soil temperature to benefit seedling development; and third, to remove weeds early, so as to avoid a large amount of water and nutrients being stolen by the seedlings. On May 21, when the wheat was bolting and the seedlings were about 40 cm high, the grass was pulled out again.

II. Supply Crops with What They Need

The famous Soviet agronomist Timiryazev said: "If you want to get a high yield, you must ask the crop what it needs, and we will supply it with what it needs." The Ma Deru team's fertilization and irrigation methods are in line with this principle.

The base fertilizer they applied was 6,000 jin of pure sheep manure per mu, and about 3,000 jin of ash soil burned from reed roots. Because sheep manure contains more nitrogen and less phosphorus and potassium, in order to enhance the lodging resistance of wheat stalks, the high-yield team applied ash soil burned from reed roots to fully supply the wheat plants with potassium fertilizer. The base fertilizer was spread on the ground before plowing twice on August 28, 1951, and turned into the ground with a plow.

The structure of the soil in the high-yield land itself is good, and the base fertilizer applied has been fully rotted, and its effectiveness is already great, so no top dressing was applied during the wheat growth period, so as to avoid causing crazy growth and lodging of the plants.

The Ma Deru team has good experience in irrigation. They clearly understand the infiltration capacity of the soil they cultivate, and have a very suitable grasp of the watering period and the amount of watering. Their watering secret is "first look at whether the wheat seedlings are good, and then look at whether the soil moisture is full"; the principle of grasping the watering period and the amount of watering is not to let the wheat seedlings be short of water and suffer from drought, nor to supply too much to make the wheat seedlings grow crazy. In addition to winter watering, in the spring, they watered the wheat in the high-yield land twice after the wheat turned green. The first watering was on May 15, when the wheat leaves covered the ground but had not yet bolted. The irrigation method was shallow irrigation, and the amount of irrigation was limited to connecting with the wet soil in the lower layer. The purpose of this watering was to supply the wheat seedlings with the water needed for plant growth and development during the bolting period. The second watering was on June 10, 25 days after the first watering, just before the heading period. This watering was to supply the wheat plants with the needs for growth and development during the heading period, flowering period, and grain filling period. Because the period from heading to grain filling is a long period, and it is the period when plants need the most water during this development stage. Therefore, the amount of irrigation this time should be more than the first time, and the speed of the water flow should be slower; this can also prevent the plants from lodging due to water rush. The timing of the two irrigations was flexibly determined according to the needs of the wheat plants.

Timely harvesting can improve the quality of wheat, and more importantly, it can reduce the losses caused by grain shattering, so it is also a link that should be paid attention to. The high-yield team harvested in a timely manner during the wheat yellow ripening period on July 21; and immediately transported it to the drying field after harvesting, avoiding the loss of grain shattering caused by long-term storage in the field.

III. How to Prevent Wheat from Lodging

The Ma Deru team has a very valuable experience in preventing densely planted wheat from lodging in areas with frequent winds during the wheat growth period:

(1) Applying grass ash. The application of grass ash supplies wheat with potassium fertilizer, which strengthens the stalks and increases the toughness of the wheat stalks.

(2) After the wheat turns green in the spring, the watering time is appropriately delayed a little, so that the internodes of the wheat become shorter, reducing the plant height, thereby resisting the attack of strong winds.

(3) Selecting fertilizer-resistant and lodging-resistant varieties.

(4) Stop irrigating when it is windy.

IV. Further Improvements May Lead to Higher Yields

Although the Ma Deru team created a new record for winter wheat yield, it cannot be said that the wheat yield per unit area has reached the maximum limit. How to further expand the high-yield area and stabilize the yield is a matter worthy of great attention. We have the following suggestions for improving the high-yield technology of the Ma Deru team:

(1) The winter wheat high-yield land is newly reclaimed wasteland where wild grasses have grown for many years, so the soil structure is very good. This also shows that the "grain-grass rotation system" advocated by the Soviet soil scientist Williams is indeed a powerful guarantee for crops to obtain high yields. If the high-yield team wants to promote their high-yield experience to a large area, they should immediately start to adopt the "grain-grass rotation system" to continuously improve soil fertility.

(2) The sowing amount per mu of the Ma Deru team's high-yield field is 14 jin, although it is 2 jin higher than the general sowing amount (the general sowing amount of the local troops is 12 jin per mu), but according to the soil fertility of the high-yield land, the team's intensive farming technology, and their rich experience in preventing lodging, the sowing amount can be appropriately increased again, and 20 jin per mu can be sown. If the sowing amount per mu of the high-yield land is 14 jin, there can be 179,550 plants per mu. According to this calculation, if it is increased to 20 jin, there will be 256,500 plants per mu. According to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, wheat can still be expected to grow well under such dense planting conditions.

(3) The high-yield team's treatment of seeds is not good enough. If only the first-grade seeds selected by the machine are used, the effect will be better; because the particles are larger and fuller, it will be able to further improve the germination rate of the seeds and promote the seedlings to grow more vigorously. In addition, although the high-yield land did not suffer from any diseases in 1952, in order to prevent it, hot water soaking and medicated powder mixing should be implemented.

(4) It is best to roll the high-yield land once when the soil freezes, so that the small gaps on the ground can be eliminated, so that the cold wind is not easy to invade, which is beneficial to the overwintering of wheat roots.

(5) The two irrigations in the high-yield land during the production period were all done at night. In fact, the irrigation time does not have to be at night. It can be done after 3 or 4 pm and before 9 or 10 am. If the distance the irrigation canal travels is long and the water temperature is not too low, irrigation can also be done at noon. This way, there is more time, so more wheat fields can be irrigated, which is conducive to large-scale yield increase.

(6) The depth of sowing with a drill is more consistent than with a pendulum drill, and the distribution of seeds per unit area is more uniform. In the future, if conditions permit, sowing machines should be used as much as possible to make emergence more uniform and to make full use of land power.

(7) The high-yield land did not implement spring harrowing work, which is a shortcoming. According to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the existing experience of farmers in some areas of our country, it should be done. In 1952, the military farm in the Manas River basin of Xinjiang has implemented spring harrowing, and the results are remarkable. The high-yield team should also follow this example in the future. Because spring harrowing has the effect of loosening the soil, preserving moisture, and preventing alkali flooding. Spring harrowing of winter wheat land should be carried out immediately when it just thaws.

(8) The plowing depth before sowing in the high-yield land is too deep (18 cm). Because the soil will become tight due to subsidence a few days after sowing, it may damage the roots of the seedlings. The plowing depth before sowing should be roughly the same as the sowing depth.

(9) According to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, harrowing can destroy the good structure of the soil, so it should be avoided as much as possible in the future. Harrows can be used instead of harrows to break the soil and level the ground. If a sowing machine is used for sowing, there is no need to use a harrow to cover the soil.

(10) It is not good to concentrate fertilizer as base fertilizer in high-yield land. In addition to two-thirds of it being used as base fertilizer, the rest can be reserved as top dressing, which can be applied twice before the wheat turns green in the spring and during the wheat heading period.

    驻屯新疆的人民解放军马德如生产小组怎样创造了去年冬小麦产量最高纪录
    编者按：这篇文章是根据新疆省人民政府农林厅、中国人民解放军新疆军区生产办公室等单位组成的“人民解放军某部小麦丰产调查团”所作的考察报告编写成的。马德如小组冬小麦的田间管理经验和紧密结合当地条件、改进技术、与自然作斗争的精神，都是值得学习的。
    驻屯在新疆开都河北岸的人民解放军某部马德如小组，一九五一年秋天播种冬麦一百二十五亩八分二厘，每亩平均产量为四百六十二斤十四两；其中有十亩七分八厘丰产地，每亩平均产量为一千三百七十七斤十一两（麦内含杂质百分之一·一，干度为百分之九十八）。这是我国一九五二年小麦单位面积产量的最高纪录。
    马德如小组的耕地在焉耆区开都河北岸的草原地带。草原南部有宽四十里长二百多里的博斯腾湖，所以地下水位较高。雨量虽然比较缺乏，（根据一九五一年八月到一九五二年七月的记载，年降雨量仅有三十七公厘），但有水量充足的开都河（流量平均为一百秒立方公尺）可供灌溉。当地是多年的草原（芨芨草遍地丛生，平均高度有五公尺以上），所以新开荒地的土壤结构良好，含有丰富的有机质，这是当地农业生产上的较有利的条件。不利条件是土地含碱质，耕种前须泡洗；春季多风，要防止小麦倒伏；气温较低，要防止麦苗遭受冻害。当地农民仅栽培春麦，认为冬麦在当地是不能种植的。自人民解放军部队驻屯以后，一九五○年便开始试种冬麦；但因栽培技术没有掌握好，完全失败。马德如小组接受了失败的教训，在一九五一年秋再行试种，一九五二年就得到了丰收。这就打破了当地农民认为当地不能种冬麦的保守观念，对扩大冬麦栽培区域起了极大的作用。
    马德如小组获得丰产的基本原因，是他们抓住了小麦丰产的每一个主要环节。影响作物生产的因素是极其复杂的，由气候土壤的自然因素到劳动组织的人为因素，由前季作物的土壤管理情况到本季作物的耕作技术的适当运用，都和作物的丰产有关。马德如小组在管理丰产地的过程中，表现了极大的工作热情，发挥了高度的集体劳动效率，对一系列的增产因素都能够灵活地掌握运用。
    一、接受失败教训，掌握科学技术
    一九五一年八月春麦收割后，马德如小组用苏联的“波波二八号”犁，于八月十四日进行耕地。犁后不耙，以增强土壤的风化。八月二十一日灌大水一次。这次灌水是为了供给种籽发芽及浇冬水前幼苗发育的需要。八月二十八日深犁一次，深度十八公分，犁后稍经晾晒，即行耙耱。所用的耙为苏联的“之字耙”，耱为当地土耱。
    他们在一九五一年九月二日播种。当时测定土壤湿度是否适宜播种的方法，是把土壤随便挖取一把，用手紧握能够成团了然后扔下，能够散开，即为合宜。播种量每亩十四市斤。播具为三脚摆耧，行距二十公分，播幅三公分，播种深度七至八公分。播种后随即耱地覆土，隔一天再用石滚（直径三十公分，长一点五公尺的有棱石滚）镇压，使种籽能和土粒密切接合，使种籽发芽时易于吸收水分。隔一日镇压是为了使地面表层土壤稍干，镇压后土粒紧密，土壤不致粘着镇压器而减低镇压作用。
    丰产地的麦种是由库车引进的“库车白芒麦”。这个品种的最大特点是不落粒，并且耐肥，秆壮。据丰产组的观察记载，这个品种的株高约达一点四公尺左右，每平方公尺约有六百七十穗左右，穗长约十公分，每穗平均有小穗十九个，每小穗平均有二粒，而且籽粒整齐饱满（每市斤有一万二千八百二十五粒）。他们能获得丰产，和选用优良品种是有密切关系的。
    在播种前，他们把种籽用苏联分级精选机选过。用精选机分出的第一级和第二级种籽，颗粒大而饱满，夹杂物（如小土粒、草屑、颖壳以及粃瘦的麦粒等）都被清除了。用这样干净的种籽，就保证了高度的发芽率。据丰产组播种前举行种籽发芽试验的结果，发芽率在百分之九十六以上。因此，丰产地没有缺苗现象，而且幼苗生长健壮，保证了每单位面积的一定密度。
    冬麦能否越冬的问题，是当地种植冬麦的一个关键性的问题。当地一九五一年的最低气温为摄氏零下一九点五度；加之冬季无雪，麦苗因为没有积雪覆盖，越冬便容易冻死。他们总结过去失败的原因，主要的有三点：一是因为播种不适时，一是灌冬水不适宜，一是播种过浅。一九五○年，他们曾在这一块丰产地种植过冬麦，播种的日期是十月三日，距结冻的日期只剩下二十多天，麦根没有扎深扎稳便上了冻；加之冬水灌得过多，地面形成冰层，而且播种深度又浅，结果在越冬期间幼苗便全部冻死。经过这一次的打击，部分组员对于在这一地区种植冬麦失去了信心。但是，大家对冻害原因作了细心的研究，终于找出了在这一地区播种冬麦的适宜时间。这个时期是由两方面的因素决定的：一方面，幼苗出土后到土壤结冻，要有足够的时间，并有足够的温度和阳光照射，使麦苗进行生根扎根和分蘖；另一方面，播种也不可太早，否则，在结冻前幼苗便容易发旺，易受冻害。丰产组的经验证明，九月上旬是当地适宜的冬小麦播种期。因为这时距土壤结冻期大约有五十多天，可使麦苗完成根系发育。
    当地冬季温度既低而又没有落雪的有利气候条件，因此除注意播期外，防止幼苗冻死的另一办法就是浇冬水。浇冬水的时间也要恰当，要使水至少在土壤结冻前能全部渗入土中。据小组的经验，冬水若灌得恰当，则土壤含有适量的水分，可以减少土壤温度变化。一九五一年丰产地浇冬水日期是十月二十日，距土壤结冻期约有十天。因为他们掌握了浇水期和浇水量，结合着他们摸索到的适当的播种时期和播种深度等因素，就使过去只能种春麦的地区种上了冬麦，也安然度过了严冬。
    春天土壤化冻后，他们曾在三月十八日镇压了一次，在四月二十一日松土一次。松土时杂草刚露出地面两三公分。这次松土的作用有三：第一是减少土壤水分蒸发；第二是增高地温，以利幼苗发育；第三是早除杂草，以免幼苗的水分和养分被大量窃夺。到五月二十一日，当小麦抽节、幼苗约四十公分高时，又拔了一次草。
    二、作物需要什么，就供给它什么
    苏联著名农学家蒂米利亚节夫说：“要想获得丰产，就必须向作物询问，看它需要什么，我们就供给它什么。”马德如小组的施肥和灌溉方法是符合这个原则的。
    他们所施基肥为每亩纯羊粪六千斤，芨芨草根所烧的灰土约三千斤。因羊粪中含氮较多，磷钾较少，为了增强小麦茎的抗倒伏性，丰产组施用了芨芨草根烧的灰土，充分供给麦株以钾肥。基肥是在一九五一年八月二十八日犁二遍地以前撒到地里，用犁翻到地下的。
    丰产地土壤本身的结构良好，所施基肥又经充分腐熟，效力已经很大，所以在小麦生长期间没有再施用追肥，以免引起植株的狂长和倒伏。
    马德如小组在灌水方面有很好的经验。他们很清楚地了解自己耕种的土壤的渗透力，对于浇水期和浇水量掌握得很适宜。他们的浇水要诀是“先看麦苗好不好，再看地墒饱不饱”；掌握浇水期和浇水量的原则是不使麦苗缺水受旱，也不供应过多使麦苗狂长。除了灌冬水之外，春天，他们在丰产地的小麦返青后灌了两次水，第一次灌水在五月十五日，在麦叶覆地尚未抽节的时候。灌水方法是浅灌，灌水量以和土壤下层的湿墒相接为度。这次灌水的目的是供给麦苗抽茎期植株生长发育所需的水分。第二次灌水是在六月十日，和第一次灌水相隔二十五天，正当抽穗期以前。这一次灌水是为了供给麦株在抽穗期、开花期及灌浆期生长发育之需。因为由抽穗到灌浆是一个很长的时期，在这个发育阶段中，正是植株需水最多的时期。所以这次的灌水量要比第一次多，而且水流的速度要慢；这样也可防止植株由于水冲而倒伏。灌两次水的时间是灵活地根据了麦株的需要情况而决定的。
    适时收获可以提高小麦品质，更重要的是可以减少麦粒脱落所招致的损失，所以也是应该注意的一个环节。丰产组在七月二十一日及时地在小麦黄熟期进行收割；并且收割后随即运到晒场，避免了在田中久放造成落粒的损失。
    三、怎样使小麦不倒伏
    马德如小组在小麦生长期间多风的地区，使密植的小麦没有倒伏，有一套非常可贵的经验：
    （一）施用草木灰。草木灰的施用给小麦供给了强健茎秆的钾肥，使小麦茎秆韧性增大。
    （二）春天小麦返青后，浇水时间适当地稍迟一些，使小麦节间变短，减低植株高度，从而能抵抗强大风力的袭击。
    （三）选用耐肥、抗倒伏的品种。
    （四）有风时停止灌溉。
    四、再加改进，可能得到更高的产量
    虽然马德如小组创造了冬麦产量的新纪录，但是决不能说小麦单位面积产量已到达最大极限。如何使丰产面积更加扩大，并使产量得到稳定的提高，是一个值得十分注意的问题。对于马德如小组丰产技术的改进，我们有以下几点建议：
    （一）冬麦丰产地是新开不久的多年来生长野草的荒地，所以土壤结构非常良好。由此也可显示出苏联土壤学家威廉斯所提倡的“谷草轮作制”确是作物获得丰产的一个有力保证。丰产组要将他们的丰产经验推广到大面积去，就应该立即着手采用“谷草轮作制”，使土壤肥力不断提高。
    （二）马德如小组丰产田每亩的播种量是十四市斤，虽然较一般的播种量提高了二市斤（当地部队一般播种量每亩是十二市斤），但是根据丰产地的土壤肥力，小组精耕细作的技术，以及他们防止倒伏的丰富经验，播种量还可以再适当增加，每亩播种二十市斤是可以的。丰产地每亩播种量十四市斤即每亩可有植株十七万九千五百五十棵，依此推算，若提高到二十斤，则每亩有植株二十五万六千五百棵。根据苏联的先进经验，小麦在这样的密植条件下，仍然可望生长良好。
    （三）丰产组对种籽的处理还不够好。如果只用机选的第一级种子，效果当会更好；因其颗粒较大而且饱满，当更能提高种子的发芽率，促进幼苗也能生长得更健壮。此外，丰产地一九五二年虽然没有遭受任何病害侵袭，但为了预防起见，应实行温汤浸种及药粉拌种。
    （四）丰产地在土壤结冻时最好能镇压一次，这样可以消灭地面的小缝隙，使寒风不易侵入，以利麦根越冬。
    （五）丰产地在生产期间浇的两次水都是在晚上浇的。其实灌水时间不必一定在晚上，在下午三、四点钟以后，早晨九、十点钟以前都可以。如果灌溉渠绕行的距离较长，水温并不太低，午间亦可灌溉。这样时间较为充裕，便可以灌溉更多的麦田，有利于大规模的增产。
    （六）条播机比摆耧播种的深度较一致，单位面积上种子的分布也比较均匀。今后如条件许可时，宜尽量采用播种机来播种，以使出苗更加整齐，使地力得以充分利用。
    （七）丰产地没有施行春耙工作，这是一个缺点。根据苏联的先进经验和我国有些地区农民已有的经验，是应该这样做的。一九五二年新疆马纳斯河流域的军营农场多已实行春耙，成绩显著，丰产组今后也宜仿行。因为春耙有松土保墒防止泛碱的作用。春耙冬麦地应在刚解冻时立即进行。
    （八）丰产地播种前的一次犁地嫌过深（十八公分）。因播种后几日土壤即因下沉而变紧，可能损伤幼苗的根部。播前犁地的深度要和播种深度大致相同才好。
    （九）根据苏联的先进经验，耱地能破坏土壤的良好结构，今后应当尽可能不采用它。碎土平地可用耙代替耱。如果用播种机播种，就无须再用耱覆土了。
    （十）丰产地把肥料集中施作基肥也是不很好的。其中除三分之二作为基肥以外，其余可留作追肥，分两次在开春小麦返青前和小麦孕穗期间施用。
