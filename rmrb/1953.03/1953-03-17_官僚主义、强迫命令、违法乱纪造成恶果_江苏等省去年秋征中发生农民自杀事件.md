Bureaucracy, Coercive Orders, and Violations of Law and Discipline Lead to Disastrous Consequences
Farmer Suicides Occur in Jiangsu and Other Provinces During Last Year's Autumn Grain Collection

    In 1952, the agricultural tax collection work in some areas failed to properly implement the tax reduction and exemption policies, resulting in farmer suicides. These disastrous consequences were caused by the bureaucratic work style of some county and district leading cadres, and the coercive orders and law-breaking behavior of grassroots cadres. According to a recent report from the Central Ministry of Finance's Jiangsu Northern Jiangsu Inspection Team, nineteen farmers in Northern Jiangsu died by suicide during the autumn grain collection, and another sixty-eight were rescued. Isolated cases of farmer suicides also occurred in the grain collection work in individual areas of Southern Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, and Jiangxi.
    Most of the farmer suicides were caused by improper tax reductions and exemptions, and the coercive order style of cadres. Li Hu-shi (female) of Houxing Village, Suining County, Jiangsu, had twenty-four mu of land, was of middle peasant status, and had eight family members (including six children). Because Li Hu-shi was blind and her labor force was not strong, her grain harvest was poor. According to normal yields, she should have paid 169 jin of public grain and had been listed as an evaluation reduction target. The village held a villagers' meeting on November 28th last year, presided over by Village Chief Yue Bangwei, to discuss the evaluation reduction issue. When Li Hu-shi's household was evaluated, the village chief did not clearly explain her family's actual difficulties to everyone, and no one spoke at the meeting. The village chief then said to her: "If everyone doesn't agree to the reduction and exemption, then forget it." At that time, Li Hu-shi expressed her dissatisfaction. The next morning, Li Hu-shi went directly to Township Chief Wang Xingye, saying that she had real difficulties and requested a reduction and exemption. Wang Xingye not only did not solve the problem, but instead said: "If you can't pay the public grain, then die." But later, Wang Xingye said he would reduce her tax by sixty jin. Li Hu-shi was extremely distressed and hanged herself on November 30th last year.
    During the autumn grain collection, some village cadres suppressed democracy and took revenge for personal grudges, leading to deaths. When Yang Dai-shi (62 years old) of Shuangba Township, Dangang Village, Huaiyin County, Jiangsu, was evaluating reductions and exemptions, she compared her harvest situation with the village cadres and asked for more reductions and exemptions. Village Chief Shao Faqing said: "She dares to compare with the cadres, someone must be instigating her, we must find out who." Zhang Naizhong, a cadre from the village work team, jumped down from his stool on the spot and angrily rebuked Yang Dai-shi. Other village cadres also severely reprimanded her. Yang Dai-shi committed suicide by jumping into the river that night, but was rescued. Chen Quanfa, a poor peasant in Tangnan Township, Dachang District, Shanghai, had a dispute with a village cadre named Zhang (who had been a puppet Bao head and self-defense captain, and had always excluded Chen Quanfa, not allowing him to participate in the peasant association). Zhang then reported to the township government that "Chen Quanfa resisted paying public grain." The township government clerk, without investigating, scolded Chen Quanfa, saying: "You don't pay public grain and you scold the cadres, you are simply a counter-revolutionary! If you don't pay the grain, you will be sent to the Public Security Bureau." That night, Chen Quanfa committed suicide.
    In some areas, during the collection of cash in lieu of public grain, the method of mechanically applying an average allocation was used, and individual farmers who could not pay the full amount of grain were forced to commit suicide. Dan Bangsheng, a poor peasant in Daming Township, Chengguan District, Taixian County, Jiangsu, should have paid 820 jin of public grain in the autumn. Because he did not have enough grain at home, he paid the public grain in cash. However, the village only allowed each household to pay four jin of cash in lieu of public grain. Dan Bangsheng asked to pay more, but the cadres did not allow it, so he committed suicide.
    These incidents have hindered the correct implementation of the agricultural tax policy, damaged the connection between the Party and the People's Government and the masses, and aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Some of them have been properly handled, but most of them have only dealt with the cases on a case-by-case basis, failing to grasp typical examples and effectively educate the cadres to improve their work style. Some simply made a perfunctory review and considered it finished; some have not yet been seriously dealt with, and even completely shifted the responsibility to objective reasons and the deceased, without examining it from the perspective of leadership ideology. Jiangsu Province had more accidents in the grain collection work last year, but the province did not examine these serious problems that occurred in the grain collection work in the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, which is not right. It is hoped that the leading organs of Jiangsu Province and other places will pay close attention to this issue in the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline.

### 官僚主义、强迫命令、违法乱纪造成恶果  江苏等省去年秋征中发生农民自杀事件

    官僚主义、强迫命令、违法乱纪造成恶果
    江苏等省去年秋征中发生农民自杀事件
      一九五二年农业税征收工作，在部分地区没有很好地贯彻减免政策，以致发生了农民被迫自杀事件。这种恶果是部分县区领导干部的官僚主义作风，和基层干部的强迫命令、违法乱纪的行为造成的。据最近中央财政部苏北检查组报告，苏北区在秋征中有十九个农民自杀致死，另有六十八人自杀遇救。在苏南、湖北、浙江、安徽、四川、江西的个别地区在征粮工作中也发生过农民自杀的事。
    农民被迫自杀事件，多数是由于减免失当和干部的强迫命令作风造成的。江苏睢宁县后行村李胡氏（女）有二十四亩地，中农成份，八口人（内有六个小孩）。李胡氏因眼睛失明，劳动力不强，粮食收成不好。按常年产量应征公粮一百六十九斤，已列为评减对象。该村在去年十一月二十八日开村民大会，由村长岳邦为主持会议，讨论评减问题。当评到李胡氏这一户时，村长没有把她家的实际困难情况向大家介绍清楚，会上无人发言。村长就向她说：“大家不同意减免就算了。”当时李胡氏表示不满。第二天早晨，李胡氏直接找王兴业乡长，说她实有困难，要求减免。王兴业不但不给解决，反说：“缴不了公粮就死。”但后来王兴业又表示要给她减免六十斤。李胡氏愁苦异常，竟在去年十一月三十日自缢身死。
    在秋征中，有些村干部压制民主，挟嫌报复，以致逼死人命。江苏淮阴县双坝乡单港村在评议减免时，村民杨戴氏（六十二岁）和村干部比较收成情况，要求多减免一些。村长邵发清说：“她敢和干部比，一定有人主使，要追问她。”该村工作组干部张乃中当场从凳子上跳下来，怒气冲冲地对杨戴氏大加申斥。其他村干部也狠狠地斥责她。杨戴氏当晚投河自杀，幸获救未死。上海市郊大场区塘南乡贫农陈全发曾与村干部张某争吵（张当过伪甲长及自卫队长，一贯排斥陈全发，不让他参加农会），张某即向乡公所报告“陈全发抗缴公粮”。乡政府文书不加调查，就责骂陈全发说：“你不缴公粮还骂干部，简直是反革命分子！再不缴粮就送公安局”。当天夜里，陈全发就自杀了。
    有些地区在征收公粮代金中，机械地运用平均摊派办法，个别不能如数交纳粮食的农民被迫自杀。江苏泰县城关区大明乡贫农单邦盛，秋季应缴公粮八百二十斤，因为家中粮食不够，即以现金代缴公粮。可是该村只准每户缴四斤公粮代金，单邦盛要求多缴，干部不准许，他就自杀了。
    这些事件阻碍了农业税收政策的正确贯彻，破坏了党和人民政府与人民群众的联系，引起群众极大不满。其中有的已经适当地处理了，但多数只是就事论事地处理案子，未能抓住典型事例，对干部进行有效的教育，以改进工作作风。有的竟轻描淡写地检讨一下，就算完了；有的至今还没有严肃处理，甚至将责任完全推到客观原因及死者身上，而没有从领导思想上加以检查。江苏省在去年征粮工作中发生的事故较多，但该省在反官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争中，就没有检查征粮工作中发生的这些严重问题，这是不对的。希望江苏省及其他地方的领导机关在反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争中，切实注意这一问题。
