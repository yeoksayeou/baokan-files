Eulogy by Zhu De, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Part of China, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, and Commander-in-chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    The great Comrade Stalin has passed away! A giant star of all mankind has fallen! Our most beloved friend and mentor of the Chinese people has parted with us forever! For this sudden and extremely unfortunate event, we Chinese people, together with the Soviet people and the people of the world, feel an unparalleled and profound grief.

    The passing of Comrade Stalin is an immeasurable loss to the working people of the world. Stalin was the great leader and mentor of the working people of the world. Stalin, together with Lenin, led the great October Socialist Revolution, which opened up the path of liberation for the workers and all oppressed people of the world. After Lenin's death, Stalin inherited the cause of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, leading the Soviet people to build socialism victoriously and advance towards communism, setting a brilliant example for progressive mankind around the world in creating a happy life. During the Second World Anti-Fascist War, Stalin led the great Soviet people and the Soviet army to defeat the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist bandits, rescuing all mankind from the danger of fascist enslavement. The forces of peace-loving people around the world united under Stalin's glorious banner, and after the war, they waged a heroic struggle to win lasting peace and people's democracy. Stalin's great contributions to all mankind radiate an eternally indelible brilliance.

    Comrade Stalin was the most beloved friend and mentor of our Chinese people. Stalin armed the Chinese Communist Party with the brilliant theory of Marxism-Leninism. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved victory in the Chinese revolution precisely by following the path pointed out by Stalin. The revolutionary cause and construction cause of the Chinese people have received consistent care, encouragement, and support from Comrade Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people under his leadership for more than 30 years. The victory and consolidation of the Chinese revolution are inseparable from the name of Stalin. Comrade Stalin will always live in the hearts of our Chinese people.

    The Chinese people will never forget Comrade Stalin's deep friendship for the Chinese people. The Chinese people will continue to advance forever in the direction indicated by Comrade Stalin. We, the people of all ethnic groups in China, all members of the Chinese Communist Party, and all soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, must unite more closely around Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, heighten our vigilance, work hard, learn from the Soviet Union, transform our infinite grief into the power of unity and struggle, and strive for victory in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, for the completion of the national construction plan, and for a steady march towards socialism.

    The Chinese people will never forget Comrade Stalin's great instruction: "The great friendship between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China is a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and a strong fortress of peace in the Far East and the world." We, the people of all ethnic groups in China, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government, will always be with the Soviet people, the Soviet Communist Party, and the Soviet government, uniting closely, strengthening our trust and support for the Soviet people, the Soviet Communist Party, and the Soviet government. We will consolidate the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and unswervingly shoulder the common cause that Comrade Stalin constantly cared for and encouraged during his lifetime. We believe that under the common banner of Lenin and Stalin, the power of our Chinese and Soviet people united together is invincible in the world, and our common cause is bound to move from victory to victory.

    Eternal glory to the great Stalin!
    The brilliance of the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin will forever shine upon our victorious advance!
    Rest in peace, Comrade Stalin!

Eulogy by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

    Comrades:
    The death of Chairman Stalin deprives the working people of the world of a great mentor and is an invaluable loss to the cause of human liberation. I cannot express how shocked I was when I first heard the news of Chairman Stalin's death. I am still suppressing my immense grief to speak.

    The success of the Chinese people's revolution and the great achievements since the founding of the People's Republic of China are inseparable from the care, guidance, and support of Chairman Stalin. I myself and many comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang have personally experienced how Chairman Stalin, together with Lenin and succeeding Lenin, guided and helped Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thinking and the beginning of the Chinese revolutionary cause in those years. Furthermore, as is well known, after Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, how Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, in the long process of leading the Chinese revolution and creating the People's Republic of China, received vigorous assistance from Chairman Stalin and the Soviet people and the Soviet government under his leadership. Stalin was not only the closest friend and great mentor of the Chinese people, but also the source of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Now, Chairman Stalin has unfortunately parted with us forever! But the historical memories of the past are forever deeply buried in our hearts; the banner of Lenin and Stalin will forever illuminate us; Stalin's program for the Soviet Union to build socialism and communism will forever indicate the path for us to move forward; Stalin's immortal name will forever live in our hearts.

    Today, as we mourn Stalin, we are extremely sad; but we should not only be sad, we should redouble our efforts. All the Chinese people should unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and victoriously complete the country's current tasks under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. The Chinese people should also unite more closely with the Soviet people, strengthen the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, to safeguard world peace.

    We must be very vigilant, our enemies are not only gloating, but also stepping up their rumors and slander. But all this is in vain. The Chinese people have deeply understood who their enemies are and who their friends are. If the imperialists dare to launch a world war of aggression, they will inevitably suffer a devastating blow from the people of China and the Soviet Union and the entire peace and democracy camp.

    Today, as we mourn Stalin, in front of our great leader Chairman Mao and the broad masses of the people, I, on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, sincerely express: we will always unswervingly follow Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party to fulfill our historical mission.

    Chairman Stalin's death makes us sad, but makes us vigilant, makes us more united, and makes us stronger. We have the wise and great people's leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party forged in a hundred battles, we will always be victorious.

    Respected Stalin, beloved Stalin, the revolutionary path you left behind will forever shine brightly, illuminating and encouraging us to advance, advance!
    Eternal glory to the great Stalin!

Eulogy by Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League

    The great leader of our great ally, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the most intimate friend and mentor of the Chinese people, and the revolutionary mentor of the working people of the whole world - Chairman Stalin, has unfortunately passed away. This is an irreparable loss to the Soviet people, the Chinese people, and the peace-loving people of the world. All members of the China Democratic League and I personally express our condolences with the most grievous feelings!

    For more than 30 years, Chairman Stalin has guided us and encouraged us on the road of revolution. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our Chinese people have achieved a great, historic revolutionary victory in accordance with the road indicated by Chairman Stalin. Chairman Stalin was the great revolutionary mentor of our Chinese people.

    Chairman Stalin cared for us and supported us in the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. Whenever the Chinese people encountered difficulties, Chairman Stalin came to help us. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Stalin gave us generous and selfless assistance in all aspects, enabling our country's construction cause to have brilliant achievements. Chairman Stalin was the most intimate and most loyal friend of our Chinese people.

    Now, Chairman Stalin has unfortunately passed away, but Stalin's doctrine, Stalin's cause, Stalin's spirit, Stalin's brilliance, will forever guide and illuminate the road of our Chinese people and the people of the world to victory.

    Now, Chairman Stalin has unfortunately passed away, but the great solidarity between the Chinese and Soviet people, personally laid by Chairman Stalin, and the noble cause of safeguarding world peace and security led by Chairman Stalin, will forever be supported by our Chinese people.

    Today, at this solemn memorial service, I, on behalf of all members of the China Democratic League, guarantee that we will work with all the democratic parties and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, to strive for the further consolidation and development of the common interests between the Chinese and Soviet people, and to strive for the common cause of defending world peace and opposing imperialist aggression.

    Victory must belong to the Soviet people, the Chinese people, and the peace-loving people of the world.

    Long live the great unity of the Chinese and Soviet people!

Eulogy by Huang Yanpei, Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association

    Today, with feelings of infinite grief, we are here to mourn the passing of the most respected mentor and dearest friend of the Chinese people—the great Chairman Stalin. Let us here extend our sincerest condolences to our great ally, the Soviet Union, and to all the Soviet people!

    On this sorrowful day, everyone recognizes that the death of Chairman Stalin is an immeasurable loss to all mankind; at the same time, we also recognize from this the immeasurable contributions of Chairman Stalin to all mankind. At the mention of the great name of Stalin, we will immediately recall the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, and also recall the great victory of the Soviet people, led by Lenin and Stalin from 1918 to 1920, in crushing the encirclement of imperialism; we also recall the great victory of the most arduous anti-fascist war won under the leadership of Chairman Stalin during the Second World War; of course, we cannot fail to recall Chairman Stalin's continuous concern, guidance, and support for the Chinese people's revolution over the past 30 years, especially after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the rapid signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and the selfless assistance that Chairman Stalin and the Soviet people under his leadership have continuously given us.

    Today, as we mourn Chairman Stalin, we must turn our grief into strength: the strength of unity, the strength of construction, the strength to strike at all aggressors and saboteurs, and, in the direction indicated by Stalin, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, heighten our vigilance, strengthen our work, first struggle to complete our New China's three major tasks this year, and struggle to further develop the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, consolidate the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and defend world peace!

    While the people of the whole world are grieving over the death of Chairman Stalin, the warmongers are "gloating." Look! The people of the whole world educated by Stalin will surely wipe away their tears, shake off their spirits, and make all necessary preparations to completely defeat all the conspiracies of the warmongers! Those who advance on the path indicated by Stalin will be victorious forever!

    Eternal glory to the great Chairman Stalin!
    Advance in the direction indicated by Stalin! Advance victoriously!

Eulogy by Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

    Comrades: Today, with extremely heavy hearts, we mourn the death of Chairman Stalin, the great mentor of the people of the world and the dearest friend of the Chinese people. The death of Chairman Stalin is an irreparable loss to the people of the whole world; it is an irreparable loss to our Chinese people.

    For thirty years, Chairman Stalin has always been concerned about the Chinese people. When our entire people were groaning under the high pressure of imperialism and feudal forces, Chairman Stalin encouraged us to advance victoriously. Especially when Japanese imperialism invaded China and our entire people suffered unprecedented disasters, Chairman Stalin gave us the strength to resist aggression in spirit and in material terms, until he helped us drive the Japanese imperialist aggressors out of China. After our revolutionary victory and the establishment of the people's democratic regime, Chairman Stalin again led the Soviet government and the people to develop fraternal and unbreakable friendship with our Chinese people under new conditions, and we, in the short period of three years, quickly ended the period of national economic recovery, and starting this year, following the path that the Soviet people have taken, began large-scale national construction, all of which was greatly helped by Chairman Stalin. As Chairman Mao pointed out: The victory of the Chinese people's revolution is inseparable from Chairman Stalin's continuous concern, guidance, and support over the past 30 years.

    Today, Chairman Stalin has unfortunately passed away! Our hearts are infinitely heavy, and our loss is unparalleled, but although Chairman Stalin has left us and parted with us forever, his spirit is immortal, and his cause and teachings, like the sun, will forever illuminate us, leading us to greater victory.

    Comrades! As we mourn Chairman Stalin here today, we must turn our grief into strength. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country must heighten our vigilance, strengthen our unity, redouble our efforts, launch an increase in production and economy, strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and be together with the powerful people of the world who love peace, headed by the Soviet Union, to fight to the end to defend world peace and build our great motherland. We have the greatest determination to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Stalin and will surely move from victory to greater victory.

    Eternal glory to Chairman Stalin, the great mentor of the people of the world and the dearest friend of the Chinese people!

Eulogy by Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association

    Comrades, friends:

    The great Stalin—the most beloved friend and mentor of the Chinese people—has parted with us forever. We are all extremely saddened by this misfortune.

    Stalin's name is as dear to us Chinese people as it is to the Soviet people. For more than 30 years, we Chinese people have been receiving his teachings and care. He encouraged and supported us to unite and heroically fight, one after another, for the liberation and independence of our nation. Today, as the Chinese revolution has achieved victory and is beginning large-scale national construction, we feel an unparalleled and enormous grief at the passing of Comrade Stalin.

    The Chinese and Soviet peoples have loved each other like brothers for 30 years. This love has grown under the banner of Lenin and Stalin. This love gave us endless warmth in the long and arduous years of struggle in the past and drew strength and confidence from it. After the victory of the Chinese revolution, this love has developed even more splendidly, becoming a deeply rooted idea and feeling in the hearts of our people. Now, there is no force in the world that can destroy or prevent the friendship and cooperation between our Chinese and Soviet peoples. Stalin's name is the greatest and most sacred symbol of this greatest and most sacred love.

    We Chinese people awakened in the era of Lenin and stood up in the era of Stalin. We learned Marxism-Leninism from Lenin and Stalin. Lenin and Stalin helped us find the truth of revolution. For us Chinese people, just like for all oppressed and enslaved nations and peoples of the world, Lenin and Stalin are light and victory.

    After the passing of Comrade Stalin, we Chinese people, all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, must protect the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples as we protect our eyes. We must always remember Comrade Stalin's teaching: "Let the great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics—a strong fortress of peace and security in the Far East—be forever consolidated." We must unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and better shoulder the cause of consolidating the Sino-Soviet alliance and defending world peace and security!

Eulogy by Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

    The great leader and mentor of the working class and working people of the world, Comrade Stalin, has parted with us forever, and the entire working class of China feels infinite grief. We hoped that the unfortunate news we heard was not true, and we hoped that Comrade Stalin would live forever. However, the unparalleled misfortune is indeed true, how can it not make our Chinese working class feel grief!

    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class achieved revolutionary victory in the era of Stalin and began to build its own future according to the Soviet example. The care, assistance, and encouragement of Comrade Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people under Comrade Stalin's leadership towards the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, through the teachings of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, are deeply felt by the Chinese working class. The Chinese working class not only infinitely respects Comrade Stalin, but also infinitely loves him.

    The Chinese working class, under the teachings of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, fully understands that, just as in the years after the deaths of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, the heart of the giant has stopped beating, but the brilliance of the giant will forever illuminate the path forward for the working class and all mankind. Before his death, Comrade Stalin had already revealed the trends of the world situation and had already planned the path to communism. The Chinese working class fully understands that the Soviet Communist Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, founded by Lenin and Stalin, are forever invincible. It is forever the banner of the working class and progressive mankind of the world and a powerful fortress of world peace. The Chinese working class will forever abide by Chairman Mao's teachings: "Forever unite closely with the great Soviet people, consolidate and strengthen the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, heighten our vigilance, redouble our efforts, strike at war instigators, and fight to the end for the permanent interests of the Soviet and Chinese people and for world peace and security." The Chinese working class will continue to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with greater efforts and intensify the construction of the country.

    Eternal glory to the great Stalin!

Eulogy by Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League

    Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world and the most beloved mentor of the Chinese people and Chinese youth, has parted with us forever. Our hearts are filled with unspeakable grief.

    Comrade Stalin was the brilliant successor to the cause of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. His life was devoted to the greatest ideal of mankind, which is to build a communist paradise in the world. This ideal is being realized in the Soviet Union. Under the guidance of the great Comrade Stalin, Soviet youth are personally building a happy life. This ideal attracts millions upon millions of young people around the world, uniting them under the banner of the great Stalin and leading them to the path of struggle. We Chinese youth, also under the call and encouragement of Comrade Stalin, unite around Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, dedicating our lives to the revolutionary cause and construction cause of the Chinese people.

    The era of Stalin is the era of the great victory of justice, democracy, and socialism for mankind. We Chinese youth grew up in this great era, which is our happiness and pride.

    Now, Comrade Stalin has parted with us forever, but the cause of Comrade Stalin will exist forever, and Comrade Stalin will forever live in our hearts. The Marxist-Leninist doctrine that Comrade Stalin developed and expanded will forever illuminate our path forward, enabling us to continue to strive for more and greater victories.

    We vow: We Chinese youth must follow the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, turn our grief into strength, and prove with new victories that we are worthy of being the youth of the Stalin era and worthy of being students of Comrade Stalin.

    We Chinese youth must also follow the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, and together with the people of the whole country, strengthen our trust and support for the Soviet Communist Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, strengthen the greatest friendship between the youth of China and the Soviet Union, consolidate the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, heighten our vigilance, redouble our efforts, and strike at war instigators.

    All members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League must, under the education of Comrade Mao Zedong, take the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League as an example, and forever be loyal sons and daughters of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, and constantly train ourselves to become brave and intelligent communist fighters.

    Eternal glory to the great Comrade Stalin!
    Rest in peace! Our most beloved Comrade Stalin!

Eulogy by Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

    All Chinese women, with infinite grief, mourn the death of Comrade Stalin, the great leader and brilliant mentor of the working people of the world. In these sorrowful days, we cannot help but deeply and repeatedly recall the consistent concern and help that Comrade Stalin gave to the Chinese revolution and construction; especially, we cannot help but recall the close care that Comrade Stalin gave to working women and all oppressed women, and the path of liberation that he revealed. As it said in Stalin’s biography, "One of Comrade Stalin's major contributions is that even when the industrialization and collectivization movements were just beginning to develop, and it was necessary to mobilize all labor forces to solve various great tasks, he had comprehensively raised the issue of women, the issue of women's status, the issue of women's labor, and the issue of the great role of women, female workers, and peasant women in economic and socio-political life, and he gave it a correct solution." His brilliant instructions not only encouraged the advance of Chinese women in the past, but also have significant practical significance for the women of New China, which is now entering a period of large-scale economic construction.

    The death of Comrade Stalin is the greatest misfortune and an irreplaceable and heavy loss to the working people of the world and all oppressed people. We Chinese women must turn grief into strength, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, following Comrade Stalin's legacy and the path of women's liberation that he revealed, more diligently learn from the advanced examples of Soviet women, further strengthen the unbreakable unity between Chinese and Soviet women, and fight to the end for the construction of our great motherland, for the support of the great Soviet Union's ongoing communist construction, and for the defense of world peace and security.

    Today, at this sad moment of Comrade Stalin's funeral, we swear to Comrade Stalin: We will definitely use the most practical actions to guarantee the realization of the above resolution.

    Respected Comrade Stalin! You are not dead! You will forever live in the hearts of our Chinese women! Your name and legacy will forever encourage us to advance!

    在我国首都各界人民追悼伟大革命导师斯大林同志大会上的悼词
    中国共产党中央委员会书记、中央人民政府副主席、中国人民解放军总司令朱德的悼词
    伟大的斯大林同志与世长辞了！全人类的巨星殒落了！我们中国人民最敬爱的朋友和导师，和我们永别了！对于这个突如其来的万分不幸的遭遇，我们中国人民，和苏联人民一起，和全世界人民一起，都感到无可比拟的深沉的悲痛。
    斯大林同志的逝世，是全世界劳动人民的不可估量的损失。斯大林是全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师。斯大林和列宁一起，领导了伟大的十月社会主义革命，这个革命开辟了全世界劳动者和一切被压迫人民的解放的道路。在列宁逝世以后，斯大林继承着马克思、恩格斯、列宁的事业，领导苏联人民胜利地建设了社会主义，并向着共产主义前进，为全世界进步人类树立了创造幸福生活的光辉榜样。在第二次世界反法西斯战争中，斯大林领导伟大的苏联人民和苏联军队打败了德意日法西斯强盗，从被法西斯奴役的危险中拯救了全人类。全世界和平爱好者的力量，在斯大林的光荣旗帜下团结了起来，在战后为争取持久和平和人民民主而进行着英勇的斗争。斯大林对全人类的伟大贡献，放射着永远不可磨灭的万丈光芒。
    斯大林同志是我们中国人民最敬爱的朋友和导师。斯大林以光辉的马克思列宁主义的理论武装了中国共产党。中国人民在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的领导下，正是遵循着斯大林指出的道路而取得中国革命的胜利。中国人民的革命事业和建设事业，从斯大林同志及其领导下的苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民那里，三十多年来得到一贯的关怀、鼓舞和支持。中国革命的胜利和巩固，和斯大林的名字是完全分不开的。斯大林同志永远活在我们中国人民的心中。
    中国人民永远不会忘记斯大林同志对于中国人民的深厚的友情。中国人民将永远按照斯大林同志指示的方向继续前进。我们中国各族人民，中国共产党的全体党员，中国人民解放军的全体战士，要更加紧密地团结在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的周围，提高警惕，努力工作，学习苏联，把无限的悲痛化为团结的战斗的力量，为争取抗美援朝斗争的胜利，为完成国家的建设计划，为稳步地走向社会主义而努力奋斗。
    中国人民永远不会忘记斯大林同志的伟大遗训：“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊，是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东和全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”我们中国各族人民、中国共产党和中国政府，要永远地和苏联人民、苏联共产党和苏联政府在一起，紧密团结，加强对苏联人民、苏联共产党和苏联政府的信任和支持。巩固以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，坚定不移地把斯大林同志生前不断关怀和鼓舞的共同事业担当起来。我们相信，在列宁、斯大林这一个共同的旗帜下，我们中苏两国人民团结起来的力量是无敌于天下的，我们的共同事业是一定要从胜利走向胜利的。
    伟大的斯大林永垂不朽！
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说的光辉永远照着我们胜利地前进！
    安息吧，斯大林同志！
    中国国民党革命委员会主席
    李济深的悼词同志们：
    斯大林主席的逝世使全世界劳动人民丧失了伟大的导师，是对全人类解放事业无可估价的损失。我已经无法说明，当我初听到斯大林主席逝世的消息的时候，我是怎样的震动。我现在仍是压制着自己万分的悲痛来说话。
    中国人民革命的成功和中华人民共和国成立以来的伟大成就，都是与斯大林主席的关怀、指导和支持分不开的。我自己和中国国民党革命委员会许多同志，对于斯大林主席怎样和列宁在一起并继列宁之后，指引和帮助孙中山先生当年革命思想的进步和中国革命事业的开端，都有过亲身的体验。更如众所周知：孙中山先生去世以后，毛主席和中国共产党在长期领导中国革命的过程中和创造中华人民共和国以来，我们如何得到斯大林主席及其领导下的苏联人民和苏联政府的大力援助。斯大林不仅是中国人民最亲密的朋友和伟大的导师，而且是中国人民革命胜利力量的源泉，现在斯大林主席竟不幸和我们永别了！可是过去的历史记忆，永远深深地埋在我们的心里；列宁和斯大林的旗帜永远的照耀着我们；斯大林对苏联建设社会主义和共产主义的纲领永远指示着我们前进的道路；斯大林不朽的名字将永远活在我们的心里。
    在哀悼斯大林的今天，我们是万分悲痛的；但我们不应当仅仅是悲痛，我们应当加倍的努力。全中国人民应当更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，在毛主席英明领导下胜利地完成国家当前的任务。中国人民还应当和苏联人民更加亲密地团结起来，加强以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，以保障世界的和平。
    我们要十分警惕，我们的敌人不仅在幸灾乐祸，而且在加紧造谣中伤。但这都是徒劳的。中国人民已经深切地了解谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。帝国主义者如果敢于发动世界侵略战争，必然要遭到中苏两国人民及整个和平民主阵营给他的毁灭性的打击。
    在哀悼斯大林的今天，在我们中国伟大领袖毛主席和广大人民的面前，我代表中国国民党革命委员会真诚地表示：我们要始终无二地跟随着毛主席和中国共产党，完成我们的历史使命。
    斯大林主席的逝世，使我们悲痛，但使我们警惕，更使我们团结，更使我们坚强。我们有英明伟大的人民领袖毛主席和百炼成钢的中国共产党，我们始终是胜利的。
    尊敬的斯大林，亲爱的斯大林，你所遗留下的革命道路永远光芒万丈，照耀着鼓舞着我们前进，前进！
    伟大的斯大林永垂不朽！
    中国民主同盟主席
    张澜的悼词
    我们的伟大盟国苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的伟大领袖、中国人民的最亲密的朋友和导师、全世界劳动人民的革命导师——斯大林主席不幸逝世了。这是苏联人民、中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民不可补偿的损失。中国民主同盟全体盟员和我个人以最沉痛的心情表示哀悼！
    三十多年来，斯大林主席在革命的道路上指导我们，鼓舞我们。我们中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，按照斯大林主席所指示的道路，取得伟大的、历史性的革命胜利。斯大林主席是我们中国人民的伟大的革命导师。
    斯大林主席在中国人民的革命事业上关心我们、支持我们。每当中国人民遭遇困难的时候，斯大林主席就来帮助我们。中华人民共和国成立后，斯大林主席更在各方面给我们慷慨无私的援助，使我们国家的建设事业能有辉煌的成就。斯大林主席是我们中国人民的最亲密、最忠诚的朋友。
    现在斯大林主席不幸逝世了，但是斯大林的学说，斯大林的事业，斯大林的精神，斯大林的光辉，永远引导着、照耀着我们中国人民和全世界人民胜利前进的道路。
    现在斯大林主席不幸逝世了，但是斯大林主席亲手奠定的中苏两国人民之间牢不可破的伟大团结，斯大林主席所领导的保卫世界和平与安全的崇高事业，将永远得到我们中国人民的拥护和支持。
    今天，在这个庄严的追悼大会上，我代表中国民主同盟全体盟员保证将和各民主党派一道，和全国人民一道，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，为进一步巩固和发展中苏两国人民之间的共同利益而奋斗，为保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略的共同事业而奋斗。
    胜利一定是属于苏联人民、中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的。
    中苏两国人民的伟大团结万岁！
    中国民主建国会主任委员
    黄炎培的悼词
    今天，我们抱着无限悲痛的心情，来追悼中国人民最敬仰的导师、最亲爱的朋友——伟大的斯大林主席的逝世。让我们在这里向我们的伟大盟邦苏联和全体苏联人民致最真挚的吊唁！
    在这个悲痛的日子里，谁都认识到斯大林主席的逝世是全人类无可估量的损失；同时，也从这里面认识到斯大林主席对于全人类无可估量的功绩。一提到斯大林这个伟大的名字，我们会立刻回忆到在列宁和斯大林领导下的伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利，还回忆到一九一八年到一九二○年列宁和斯大林所领导的苏联人民粉碎帝国主义围攻的伟大胜利；还回忆到在第二次世界大战时期，在斯大林主席领导下所取得的最艰险的反法西斯战争的伟大的胜利；当然，更不能不回忆到三十年来斯大林主席对中国人民革命的不断关怀、指导和支持，特别在中华人民共和国成立以后，很快地签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，以及斯大林主席和在他领导下的苏联人民所不断给予我们的无私的援助。
    今天，我们哀悼斯大林主席，必须把悲痛化为力量：团结的力量，建设的力量，打击一切侵略者、破坏者的力量，朝着斯大林所指示的方向，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，提高警惕，加强工作，首先为完成我们新中国今年的三大任务而斗争，为更进一步地发展中苏两国人民的友谊、巩固以苏联为首的和平民主阵营、保卫世界和平而斗争！
    当全世界人民为斯大林主席的逝世而万分悲痛的时候，战争贩子们正在那里“幸灾乐祸”。看吧！为斯大林所教育了的全世界人民，一定会抹干了眼泪，抖擞起精神，作好一切必要的准备，使得战争贩子们所有的阴谋活动，完全失败！在斯大林所指示的道路上前进的人们是永远胜利的！
    伟大的斯大林主席永垂不朽！
    向着斯大林指示的方向前进！胜利地前进！
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席
    陈叔通的悼词
    同志们：我们今天以万分沉痛的心情，来哀悼世界人民伟大的导师和中国人民最亲爱的朋友斯大林主席。斯大林主席的逝世，是全世界人民无可补偿的损失；是我们中国人民无可补偿的损失。
    三十年来，斯大林主席始终关怀着中国人民。在我们全国人民正呻吟于帝国主义和封建势力的高压下的时候，斯大林主席鼓舞了我们胜利前进。尤其是日本帝国主义侵入中国，我全国人民受到空前灾难的时候，斯大林主席在精神上和物质上给予我们以抵抗侵略的力量，直到帮助我们把日本帝国主义侵略者赶出中国。我们革命胜利，人民民主政权建立以后，斯大林主席又领导了苏联政府与人民，在新的条件下同我们中国人民发展了兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊，而我们在三年短促的时间中，迅速地结束了国民经济恢复时期，并从今年起，依照苏联人民所走过的道路，开始了国家大规模建设，都从斯大林主席那里得到伟大的帮助。正如毛主席所指出：中国人民革命的胜利和斯大林主席三十年来不断的关怀、指导和支援，是完全分不开的。
    今天，斯大林主席不幸逝世了！我们的心情是无限沉痛的，我们的损失是无可比拟的，但是斯大林主席虽然离开了我们，和我们永别了，而他的精神是永垂不朽的，他的事业和遗教如太阳一样，将永远的照耀着我们，领导着我们向更大的胜利道路前进。
    同志们！我们今天在这里哀悼斯大林主席，必须化悲痛为力量。我们全国人民要在伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导下提高警惕，加强团结，加倍努力，展开增产节约，加强抗美援朝，和以苏联为首的全世界爱好和平的强大人民在一起，为了保卫世界和平和建设我们伟大的祖国而奋斗到底。我们有最大的决心，遵循着斯大林主席所指示的方向前进，一定会从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    全世界人民的伟大导师和中国人民最亲爱的朋友斯大林主席永垂不朽！

    吴玉章的悼词同志们，朋友们：
    伟大的斯大林——中国人民的最敬爱的朋友和导师，和我们永别了。我们大家都为这个不幸感到万分的悲痛。
    斯大林的名字，对于我们中国人民，和对于苏联人民一样，是最亲切的。三十多年来，我们中国人民就是受着他的教导和关怀，他鼓舞和支持我们团结起来，为争取自己民族的解放和独立，前仆后继地英勇奋斗。在中国革命取得胜利并正开始大规模国家建设的今天，我们对于斯大林同志的逝世，更是感到无可比拟的深沉巨大的悲痛。
    中苏两国人民三十年来如像兄弟般地互相友爱。这种友爱，是在列宁和斯大林的旗帜下生长起来的。这种友爱，使我们在过去长期艰苦斗争的岁月里，得到无限的温暖，并从中吸取着力量和信心。这种友爱，在中国革命胜利以后，更加灿烂辉煌地发展了起来，成为我国人民心中根深蒂固的思想和感情。现在世界上，再没有一种力量能够破坏和阻止我们中苏两国人民的友谊与合作了。斯大林的名字，就是这种最伟大最神圣的友爱的最伟大最神圣的象征。
    我们中国人民是在列宁的时代觉醒起来，又在斯大林时代站了起来。我们从列宁、斯大林那里学会了马克思列宁主义。列宁斯大林帮助我们找到了革命的真理。对于我们中国人民说来，正像对世界一切被压迫被奴役的民族和人民一样，列宁和斯大林，就是光明，就是胜利。
    在斯大林同志逝世之后，我们中国人民，中苏友好协会的全体会员，要像保护我们的眼睛一样，保护中苏两国人民的深厚友谊。我们要永远记住斯大林同志的教训：“让中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会
    主义共和国联盟的伟大友谊——远东和平及安全的
    坚强堡垒永远巩固”。我们一定要紧紧地团结在中
    国共产党和毛主席的周围，把巩固中苏同盟、保卫
    世界和平与安全的事业更好地担当起来！

    赖若愚的悼词
    全世界工人阶级和劳动人民伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志和我们永别了，全中国的工人阶级都感到无限的悲痛。我们希望自己所听到的不幸消息不是真实的，我们希望斯大林同志万寿无疆。然而无比的不幸竟然是真实的，怎能不使我们中国工人阶级感到悲痛呢！
    中国工人阶级在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，在斯大林的时代取得了革命的胜利，开始照着苏联的榜样缔造着自己的未来。斯大林同志和斯大林同志领导之下的苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民对于中国工人阶级和中国人民的关怀、援助和鼓舞，通过毛主席和中国共产党的教导，中国工人阶级是深切地感受到的。中国工人阶级对于斯大林同志不但无限地崇敬，而且无限地热爱。
    在毛主席和中国共产党教导之下的中国工人阶级完全懂得，正如马克思、恩格斯、列宁逝世以后的年月一样，巨人的心脏停止跳动了，而巨人的光芒却永远照耀着工人阶级和全人类前进的道路。斯大林同志在逝世之前，已经揭示了世界局势的动向，已经规划了走向共产主义的道路。中国工人阶级完全懂得：列宁、斯大林手创的苏联共产党和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟是永远不可战胜的，它永远是全世界工人阶级和进步人类的旗帜，是世界和平的强大堡垒。中国工人阶级将永远遵照毛主席的教导：“和伟大的苏联人民永远紧密地团结一致，巩固并加强以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，提高警惕，加倍努力，打击战争挑拨者，为苏中两国人民的永久利益和世界和平与安全而奋斗到底。”中国工人阶级将以更大的努力，继续学习苏联的先进经验，加紧进行国家的建设事业。
    伟大的斯大林永垂不朽！

    胡耀邦的悼词
    世界劳动人民的伟大领袖，中国人民和中国青年最敬爱的导师斯大林同志，他和我们永别了。我们心里，充满了说不出的悲痛。
    斯大林同志是马克思、恩格斯、列宁的事业的天才继承者。他的一生，服务于人类最伟大的理想，这就是在世界上建设共产主义的乐园。这个理想正在苏联实现着。苏联青年在伟大的斯大林同志的教导下，亲手建设着幸福的生活。这个理想，吸引着全世界千千万万的青年，在伟大的斯大林的旗帜下，团结起来，奔向斗争的道路。我们中国青年，也正是在斯大林同志的号召和鼓舞下，团结在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的周围，把自己的生命贡献给中国人民的革命事业和建设事业。
    斯大林的时代，是人类的正义、民主和社会主义伟大胜利的时代，我们中国青年生长在这个伟大的时代里，这是我们的幸福和骄傲。
    现在，斯大林同志和我们永别了，但是，斯大林同志的事业是永远存在的，斯大林同志将永远活在我们的心里。斯大林同志所发扬扩大起来的马克思列宁主义学说，将永远照耀着我们前进的道路，使我们能够继续争取更多更大的胜利。
    我们宣誓：我们中国青年一定遵照毛泽东同志的指示，把悲痛化为力量，用新的胜利来证明：我们不愧是斯大林时代的青年，不愧是斯大林同志的学生。
    我们中国青年，也一定遵照毛泽东同志的指示，和全国人民在一起，加强对苏联共产党和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的信任和支持，加强中苏两国青年最伟大的友谊，巩固以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，提高警惕，加倍努力，打击战争挑拨者。
    我们中国新民主主义青年团全体团员，一定在毛泽东同志的教养下，以苏联列宁共产主义青年团作榜样，永远做中国人民和中国共产党的忠实儿女，不断地把自己锻炼成为勇敢的和有智慧的共产主义战士。
    伟大的斯大林同志永垂不朽！
    安息吧！我们最敬爱的斯大林同志！

    许广平的悼词
    全中国妇女，怀着无限的悲痛，哀悼全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和天才导师斯大林同志的逝世。在这悲痛的日子里，不能不使我们深刻地一再回忆斯大林同志曾经对中国革命和中国建设事业所给予的
    一贯的关心和帮助；尤其不能不使我们回忆到斯大林同志对劳动妇女和一切被压迫的妇女所给予的亲切的关怀，和所昭示的解放的道路。正如斯大林传略上所说的：“斯大林同志底重大功绩之一，就是还在工业化和集体化运动刚开始发展，必须动员民间一切劳动力量去解决各种伟大任务的时期，他已把妇女问题，妇女地位问题，妇女劳动问题，妇女、女工和农妇在经济和社会政治生活中有极大作用的问题全盘提出，尽量提出，并给了它一个正确的解决。”他的英明的指示，不仅在过去鼓舞了中国妇女的前进，而且特别对正进入大规模经济建设时期的新中国妇女，更有着重大的现实的意义。
    斯大林同志的逝世，是全世界劳动人民和一切被压迫的人民最大的不幸和无可补偿的沉重损失。我们中国妇女，必须化悲痛为力量，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，遵循着斯大林同志的遗训与他所昭示的妇女解放的道路，更努力地学习苏联妇女的先进榜样，更加加强中苏两国妇女牢不可破的团结，为建设我们伟大的祖国，为支持伟大苏联正在进行的共产主义的建设事业，为保卫世界的和平与安全而奋斗到底。
    我们在今天——斯大林同志举行丧礼的这个悲痛的时刻，来向斯大林同志宣誓：我们一定用最实际的行动，来保证上述决心的实现。
    敬爱的斯大林同志！您没有死！您将永远活在我们中国妇女的心中！您的名字和遗训，将永远地鼓舞我们前进！
