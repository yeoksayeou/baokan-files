Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: The people of Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria are intensifying their work and striving to produce, to commemorate Comrade Stalin, the leader and teacher of the world's working people.

	Polish workers are launching a socialist emulation campaign to commemorate Stalin. All workers of the Stalin Mechanical Factory in Poznan, the Stalin Textile Factory (in Lodz), the largest textile factory in Poland, and the construction workers of "Nowa Huta" metallurgical plant, one of Poland's great socialist construction projects, are actively participating in this movement. Workers at the Starachowice Automobile Factory have combined the labor emulation in memory of Comrade Stalin with the labor emulation to greet May Day, making it a long-term emulation movement. They stipulated that in the three months of March, April, and May, labor productivity should be increased by 15 percent. Polish workers have continuously achieved new successes in this high tide of labor enthusiasm. The foundry workers of the Lower Silesia Metallurgical Factory have recently overproduced the planned output by 40 percent every day, and the workers in the mechanical department of the foundry workshop completed 90 percent of the March production plan on March 15th. Farmers in agricultural production cooperatives, workers in state farms, and workers in machine tractor stations in various regions have guaranteed to increase the yield per unit area of grain and to complete the fertilizer application and spring plowing plans ahead of schedule. Many advanced workers, farmers, and intellectuals have submitted applications to join the Polish United Workers' Party. Shock workers at the Beirut Automobile Factory in Lublin are striving to join the Party with concrete actions of completing 250 to 450 percent of their production quotas.
	Advanced working people from all over Romania have been publishing articles in newspapers for days, expressing their intention to commemorate Comrade Stalin with practical actions. Many factory workers are determined to unite closely around the Romanian Workers' Party and intensify production. O. Stegaru, chairman of the Romanesti collective farm, published an article in the newspaper saying: "Comrade Stalin has pointed out the path to prosperity and happiness for us. We guarantee to turn our collective farm into a strong collective farm." In recent days, news of new labor achievements has been pouring in from industrial enterprises all over Romania. The lathe operators of the "Peace Workshop" of the "December 21st" (Comrade Stalin's birthday) Mechanical Factory have recently increased their production volume to 115 percent of the past.
	Many enterprises and construction sites in Bulgaria have organized Stakhanovite work teams to commemorate Comrade Stalin. The construction workers of the flotation plant in Rudozem have announced March as a month of high production movement. Many workers in Sofia, Plovdiv, Stara Zagora, Ruse, and other industrial centers have participated in the work teams commemorating Stalin.

    波兰等国人民以实际行动纪念斯大林同志
    【新华社二十四日讯】波兰、罗马尼亚和保加利亚人民正加紧工作，努力生产，来纪念世界劳动人民的领袖和导师斯大林同志。
    波兰工人正在展开纪念斯大林的社会主义竞赛运动。波兹南的斯大林机械工厂、波兰最大纺织工厂——斯大林纺织工厂（在罗兹）的全体工人，波兰伟大社会主义建设工程之一“诺瓦·胡塔”冶金工厂的建筑工人，都积极地参加了这个运动。斯塔拉霍维茨汽车工厂的工人把纪念斯大林同志的劳动竞赛和迎接五一节的劳动竞赛结合起来，成为长期的竞赛运动。他们规定在三、四、五三个月内，把劳动生产率提高百分之十五。波兰工人在这种高涨的劳动热潮中不断地获得了新的成就。下西里西亚冶金工厂的翻砂工人最近每天超过计划多生产百分之四十的产品，翻砂工场机械部的工人在三月十五日就完成了三月份生产计划的百分之九十。各地农业生产合作社的农民、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的工人，已保证要提高谷物的单位面积产量，提前完成施肥和春耕的计划。许多先进的工人、农民和知识分子纷纷提出加入波兰统一工人党的申请书。卢布林的贝鲁特汽车工厂的突击工人，以完成生产定额的百分之二百五十到四百五十的具体行动，来争取入党。
    罗马尼亚各地的先进的劳动人民连日纷纷在报纸上发表文章，表示要用实际行动来纪念斯大林同志。许多工厂的工人决心要紧密地团结在罗马尼亚工人党的周围，加紧生产。罗曼涅什蒂集体农庄主席奥·斯特加鲁在报纸上发表文章说：“斯大林同志已向我们指出了走向富裕和幸福的道路。我们保证要把我们的集体农庄变成强大的集体农庄。”这些天来，罗马尼亚各地的工业企业纷纷传来了新的劳动成就的消息。“十二月二十一日”（斯大林同志的生日）机械工厂“和平车间”的镟工们最近已把生产量提高为过去的百分之一百一十五。
    保加利亚的许多企业和建筑工地为纪念斯大林同志组织了斯塔哈诺夫式工作班。鲁多泽姆市的浮游选矿厂的建筑工人已宣布三月为高度生产运动月。索非亚、普罗夫迪夫、斯塔拉·萨哥拉、卢斯和其他工业中心的许多工人，都参加了纪念斯大林的工作班。
