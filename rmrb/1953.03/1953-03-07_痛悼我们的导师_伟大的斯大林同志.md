    Mourn the Death of Our Teacher – The Great Comrade Stalin
    The great leader and brilliant teacher of the working people of the world, Comrade Stalin, has departed from us forever. This is an irreplaceable and profound loss for the world's working class and all progressive humanity after the passing of Marx, Engels, and Lenin.
    The news of Comrade Stalin's death has filled our Party and our people with boundless grief, just as it has the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people. In this sorrowful moment, we cannot help but recall the Bolshevik oath made by Comrade Stalin twenty-nine years ago, upon the death of the great Lenin. That oath transformed the boundless sorrow of the entire Party, the entire working class, and the entire Soviet people into invincible strength. Today, we must, with the same spirit as that oath, faithfully follow all of Comrade Stalin's behests and resolutely struggle for the glorious realization of all his teachings.
    Comrade Stalin, together with Lenin, founded and personally nurtured the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, making it the vanguard of the world's working-class revolution and a common model for working-class parties around the world. This Party created the world's first great and glorious socialist state and powerfully aided the people's revolutionary cause throughout the world. As the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stated in its congratulatory message to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "Lenin and Stalin are the banners guiding the working people of the world forward. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a model for communist parties and workers' parties of all countries. The Soviet Union, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin's Party – the Communist Party of the Soviet Union – is a strong bastion of world peace and democracy. All progressive causes in the world are inseparable from the existence and development of the Soviet Union. The people of the world look up to the Soviet Union, regarding it as their future and their hope." Our Chinese Communist Party was established by taking the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as a model and the teachings of Lenin and Stalin as a guide; the path that our Chinese revolution is to follow is precisely the path of the Soviet Union.
    Our Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people will never forget the special care Comrade Stalin showed throughout his life for our revolution and our people. Our Chinese Communist Party grew up in the era of Stalin and achieved victory in the era of Stalin. Comrade Stalin made extremely wise instructions on various issues concerning the nature, strategy, and tactics of the Chinese revolution, crushed the nonsense of the Trotskyite bandits regarding the Chinese revolution, and developed Lenin's theory on colonial and semi-colonial revolutions. The Chinese revolution achieved victory under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong by following Comrade Stalin's instructions. The socialist Soviet Union, built under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, gave great assistance to our revolution. In the years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the generous and selfless assistance of Comrade Stalin and the Soviet people and government has played an immeasurable role in our country's economic and cultural construction.
    As our Party and our people deeply mourn the death of Comrade Stalin, our flesh-and-blood, inseparable connection with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people becomes even more apparent. This flesh-and-blood, inseparable connection is primarily forged by our common ideological strength. This inexhaustible ideological strength is Marxism-Leninism, is Stalin's doctrine. As Comrade Malenkov said in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, "Comrade Stalin's theoretical discoveries are of worldwide historical significance. These theoretical discoveries, with the knowledge of revolutionary methods of transforming society and the rich experience accumulated by our Party in the struggle to realize communism, arm the people of all countries." Comrade Stalin's recently published works such as "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and "Speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," creatively enriched and developed the science of Marxism-Leninism, giving us new and unparalleled sharp theoretical weapons. They will have an extremely great impact on all our practical activities and will greatly facilitate us in striving for the continuous victory of our cause. Our Party and state's senior cadres, under the leadership of our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, have recently been studying Comrade Stalin's works on economic problems and the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and have already rapidly improved our ability to observe and judge our forward goals. We must also work harder to study Stalin's doctrine, study the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and study the Soviet Union's various scientific theories and advanced experiences, so that we truly become good students of Comrade Stalin.
    After the unfortunate death of Comrade Stalin, we must further strengthen the unity between China and the Soviet Union and further support all the undertakings of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a thoroughly tempered Party, fully armed with the doctrines of Lenin and Stalin and completely mature in all aspects. It was our example in the past, it is our example now, and it will be our example in the future. Continuing to learn from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our extremely important task.
    The Soviet state led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a country that is victoriously building communism, is the most powerful bastion defending world peace, and is the beacon of victory for the cause of human liberation. The camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state it leads, will undoubtedly be increasingly consolidated and developed, and will advance along the path indicated by the great Stalin.
    Comrade Malenkov said correctly in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "The Soviet state is no longer an isolated island surrounded by capitalist countries. We are advancing side by side with the great Chinese people, and advancing together with the millions of people of the people's democracies and the German Democratic Republic. All progressive humanity sympathizes with us and supports us. We are defending the cause of peace and friendship among all peoples with all these forces." Any enemy of peace, democracy, and socialism who does not recognize this truth will certainly be battered and bloodied. The imperialists rejoice at the death of Comrade Stalin, but history judges that the rejoicing imperialists are bound to die, while we are bound to win forever.
    The just cause of the working class and all progressive humanity around the world has proven in the past and will prove even more in the future the invincible power of Marxism-Leninism and the invincible power of Stalin's doctrine. Although our beloved teacher Comrade Stalin has passed away, his brilliant doctrine will never leave us. Comrade Stalin is an immortal giant, he is forever with us, continuing to guide us with his brilliant doctrine to complete the cause he left us.

### 痛悼我们的导师——伟大的斯大林同志

    痛悼我们的导师——伟大的斯大林同志
    全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和天才导师斯大林同志和我们永别了。这是马克思、恩格斯、列宁逝世以后，世界工人阶级和全体进步人类的无可补偿的沉重损失。
    斯大林同志逝世的消息传来，我们的党和我国人民，同苏联共产党和苏联人民一样，怀着无穷的悲痛。在这个悲痛的日子里，我们不能不想起二十九年前，在伟大的列宁逝世的时候，斯大林同志所作的布尔什维克的誓言。这誓言，把全党、全体工人阶级、全体苏维埃人民的无穷悲痛，化成了坚强无敌的力量。今天我们就是要以和这誓言同样的精神，忠实地遵循斯大林同志的全部遗训，为他的全部遗训的光荣实现而坚持奋斗。
    斯大林同志和列宁在一起缔造了并亲自培育了苏联共产党，使它成为全世界工人阶级革命的先锋队，成为全世界工人阶级政党共同的模范。这个党创造了世界上第一个伟大灿烂的社会主义国家，并且有力地援助了全世界的人民革命事业。正如中国共产党中央委员会致苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的祝词中所说的：“列宁、斯大林是引导全世界劳动人民前进的旗帜。苏联共产党是世界各国共产党和工人党的模范。在列宁、斯大林的党——苏联共产党领导下的苏联是世界和平民主的强大堡垒。世界上一切进步事业都是和苏联的存在与发展分不开的。全世界人民仰望着苏联，把苏联看作自己的将来和自己的希望。”我们中国共产党就是以苏联共产党为模范和以列宁、斯大林的学说为指南而建立起来的；我们中国革命所要走的道路也正是苏联的道路。
    我们中国共产党和中国人民将永远不会忘记斯大林同志毕生对于我国革命和我国人民的特殊关怀。我们中国共产党是成长在斯大林的时代，胜利在斯大林的时代。斯大林同志对中国革命的性质和战略策略的各种问题作了极其英明的指示，粉碎了托洛茨基匪徒对中国革命的胡说，发展了列宁关于殖民地半殖民地革命的理论。中国革命就是在毛泽东同志的领导下，遵循斯大林同志的指示而获得胜利的。在斯大林同志领导下建成了社会主义的苏联，对于我国的革命，给了伟大的援助。在中华人民共和国成立以后的这些年月里，斯大林同志和苏联人民及苏联政府的慷慨无私的援助，对于我们国家的经济建设和文化建设所起的作用是不可估量的。
    我们的党和我国人民在沉痛哀悼斯大林同志逝世的时候，更加显出了我们与苏联共产党和苏联人民之间的血肉般的不可分的联系。这种血肉般的不可分的联系，首先是由我们共同的思想力量凝结起来的。这种无穷无尽的思想的力量，就是马克思列宁主义，就是斯大林的学说。正如同马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告中所说的，“斯大林同志在理论上的发现，具有全世界历史性的意义。这种理论发现，以革命改造社会方法的知识以及我党在为实现共产主义的斗争中所积累的丰富经验，武装了各国人民。”斯大林同志遗留给我们的新近发表的“马克思主义与语言学问题”、
    “苏联社会主义经济问题”和“在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说”等著作，创造性地丰富了和发展了马克思列宁主义的科学，给了我们以崭新的无比锐利的理论武器。它们对于我们的一切实际活动，将发生极其巨大的影响，将大大地便利于我们去争取我们事业的不断胜利。我们的党和国家的高级干部，在我们党中央和毛泽东同志领导下，最近时期在学习斯大林同志关于经济问题的著作和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文件中，就已经迅速提高着我们对于前进目标的观察和判断的本领。我们还必须更加努力地学习斯大林的学说，学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文件，学习苏联的各种科学理论和先进经验，使我们真正成为斯大林同志的好学生。
    在斯大林同志不幸地逝世之后，我们要更加加强中苏两国的团结，更加支持苏联共产党的一切事业。苏联共产党是以列宁、斯大林的学说充分武装起来的、在各方面完全成熟了的百炼成钢的党，它过去是我们的榜样，现在是我们的榜样，将来也是我们的榜样。继续学习苏联共产党乃是我们极其重要的任务。
    苏联共产党所领导的苏维埃国家是胜利地建设着共产主义的国家，是保卫世界和平的最强大的堡垒，是人类解放事业胜利的灯塔。在以苏联共产党和它所领导的苏维埃国家为首而紧紧地团结起来的和平、民主和社会主义阵营，无疑地将日益巩固和发展，沿着伟大斯大林所指示的道路前进。
    马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告说得对：“苏维埃国家现在再不是一个被资本主义国家包围的孤岛了。我们正和伟大的中国人民并肩前进，和各人民民主国家及德意志民主共和国的千百万人民一道向前迈进。全体进步人类同情我们并支持我们。我们正和所有这些力量一道保卫和平与各族人民友好的事业。”任何和平民主和社会主义的敌人，如果不认识这个真理，就将会碰得头破血流，那是一定的。帝国主义者因斯大林同志的逝世而幸灾乐祸，但是历史是这样判断的：幸灾乐祸的帝国主义者
    一定不免于死亡，而我们是一定要永远胜利的。
    全世界工人阶级和一切进步人类的正义事业，过去已经证明、今后还将更加证明马克思列宁主义的无敌力量，更加证明斯大林学说的无敌力量。我们敬爱的导师斯大林同志虽然逝世了，他的天才的学说却永远不离开我们。斯大林同志是不朽的巨人，他永远和我们在一起，以他的天才的学说继续引导我们，去完成他所遗留给我们的事业。
