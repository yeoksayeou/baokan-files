    Opening of the China Coal Miners' Accelerated Secondary School
    The China Coal Miners' Accelerated Secondary School in Qinhuangdao opened on March 9th. The school was established last autumn on the basis of the former China Coal Miners' School. Its mission is to rapidly improve the educational level of its students, laying the foundation for preparing them to become specialized technical personnel. Currently, the school has more than 1,920 students. These students are advanced producers and activists from coal mines across the country, including national model workers such as Ma Liuhai and Shi Yuhai, who are studying at the school. The school is divided into an accelerated secondary school main division and a preparatory division. The preparatory division uses one year to allow workers who were originally semi-literate or illiterate to complete the basic primary school curriculum, and then transfer to the main division, which completes the basic secondary school curriculum in three years. After graduating from the school, the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government plans to send all students to the China Institute of Mining and Technology in Tianjin and the Huainan Coal Mine Industrial College for further study.

    中国煤矿工人速成中学开学
    秦皇岛中国煤矿工人速成中学已在三月九日开学。该校是去年秋季在原中国煤矿工人学校的基础上建立起来的，任务是用速成的办法提高学员的文化水平，为准备把他们培养成为专门技术人材打下基础。目前全校共有学员一千九百二十多人。这些学员都是全国各煤矿中的先进生产者和积极分子，全国著名的劳动模范马六孩、施玉海等都在该校学习。该校分设速成中学本部和预备部。预备部以一年的时间，使原为半文盲、文盲的工人学完小学基本课程，再转入本部，本部在三年内学完中等学校的基本课程。该校学员毕业后，中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局计划全部送入天津的中国矿业学院和淮南煤矿工业专科学校继续学习。
