Folk Music and Dance Performances Held Across the Country

    In order to promote the excellent traditions of folk art and better carry out mass art activities, under the direction of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, provinces, cities, or special districts and counties across the country held folk music and dance performances around the Spring Festival this year. Twenty provinces and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin held provincial and municipal-level performances; five provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held performances at the special district, city, and county levels. During this period, the Art Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture also organized more than 180 music, dance, and drama workers from Beijing and Tianjin, including Dai Ailian, Li Ling, Li Huanzhi, Liang Hanguang, and Chen Jingqing, into groups to visit various places for observation and learning.

    This performance fully demonstrated the richness of content and diversity of forms of folk music and dance art in various places. According to preliminary investigations and statistics, the artistic forms currently discovered include 268 kinds such as "Big Drum Competition" (drum dance), "Phoenix Three Nods" (lantern dance), "Sending Spring," "Ground Flower Drum," "Flower Cymbal," "Two-Person Turn," "Peace Drum," "Mountain Song," "Taoist Ballad," "Bamboo Horse," and "Shield Dance." These excellent folk music and dances are welcomed and loved by the broad masses of people. Before liberation, due to the rule and oppression of the reactionary regime, the people's lives were miserable, and many folk arts were buried or even lost. Now, through the efforts and excavation of cultural leading departments at all levels and literary and art workers, many excellent folk art forms have been discovered, as well as folk artists and amateur artists who possess superb skills. This folk music and dance performance in various places plays a significant role in further developing folk art, enriching people's cultural life, and improving professional art workers.

    各地举行民间音乐、舞蹈会演
    为了发扬民间艺术的优秀传统，更好地开展群众艺术活动，在中央人民政府文化部的指示下，今年春节前后，全国各地大都举办了省、市或专区、县的民间音乐舞蹈会演。有二十个省和北京、天津两市举行了省、市级的会演；有五个省和内蒙古自治区举行了专区、市、县级的会演。在此期间，中央文化部艺术事业管理局并组织了北京、天津两地音乐、舞蹈、戏剧工作者戴爱莲、李凌、李焕之、梁寒光、陈镜清等一百八十余人，分成小组前往各地观摩学习。
    这次会演充分证明了各地民间音乐舞蹈艺术内容的丰富和形式的多样。根据初步调查和统计，目前已发现的艺术形式有：“大鼓赛”（鼓舞）、“凤凰三点头”（灯舞）、“送春”、“地花鼓”、“花钹”、“二人转”、“太平鼓”、“山歌”、“道情”、“竹马”、“盾牌舞”等二百六十八种。这些优秀的民间音乐舞蹈是广大人民群众所喜闻乐见的。解放以前，由于反动政权的统治和压迫，人民生活痛苦不堪，许多民间艺术都被埋没甚至失传。现在，经过各级文化领导部门和文艺工作者的努力和挖掘，发现了不少优秀的民间艺术形式，和保存着精湛技术的民间老艺人以及业余艺人。这次各地的民间音乐舞蹈会演，对进一步地发展民间艺术，丰富人民文化生活，以及对专业艺术工作者的提高，都有重大的作用。
