Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th: TASS Moscow, March 4th dispatch: The following is the communiqué regarding the illness of Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union announce: Our Party and the people of our country have suffered a misfortune – Comrade J.V. Stalin has fallen seriously ill.

On the night of March 1st, Comrade Stalin, while at his residence in Moscow, suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, a disease that severely affected important parts of his brain. Comrade Stalin lost consciousness. His right arm and right leg were paralyzed. Subsequently, he lost the ability to speak. Serious disturbances occurred in heart activity and respiration.

The most outstanding medical personnel were summoned to treat Comrade Stalin. They are: Professor P.Ye. Lukomsky, internist; Academicians of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences: Professor N.V. Konovalov, neurologist; Professor A.L. Myasnikov, internist; Professor Ye.M. Tareev, internist; Professor I.N. Filimonov, neurologist; Professor R.A. Tkachev, neurologist; Professor I.S. Grazhunov, neurologist; Lecturer V.I. Ivanov-Neznamov, internist. The diagnosis and treatment of Comrade Stalin's illness are being carried out under the leadership of A.F. Tretyakov, Minister of Health of the Soviet Union, and I.I. Kupalin, Head of the Kremlin Medical and Sanitation Department.

The diagnosis and treatment of Comrade Stalin's illness are being carried out under the constant supervision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government.

In view of the seriousness of Comrade Stalin's health, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union deem it necessary to begin publishing diagnostic communiqués on the state of health of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, starting today.

Due to Comrade Stalin's serious illness, he will inevitably be unable to participate in leadership activities for a period of time, be it long or short. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, like our entire Party and all of our Soviet people, recognize the full significance of this fact.

The Central Committee and the Council of Ministers, in leading the Party and the country, are taking into extremely serious consideration all the circumstances arising from Comrade Stalin's temporary absence from the leadership of the state and the Party.

The Central Committee and the Council of Ministers believe that in these difficult days, our Party and all the Soviet people will demonstrate the greatest unity and cohesion, a firm spirit and vigilance, will redouble their efforts in the communist construction of our country, and will unite more closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government.

    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议
    发表关于斯大林同志病况公报
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日电：关于苏联部长会议主席、苏联共产党中央委员会书记约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林同志病况的公报如下：
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议宣告：我们的党和我国人民遭到了不幸——约·维·斯大林同志患了重病。
    三月一日夜晚，斯大林同志在莫斯科他的住所的时候，得了脑溢血症，这种疾病严重地影响了他的脑子的重要部分。斯大林同志失去了知觉。他的右臂和右腿麻痹了。接着就失去了说话的能力。心脏的活动和呼吸发生了严重的障碍。
    召请了最优秀的医务人员来为斯大林同志治病。他们是：内科医生普·叶·卢科姆斯基教授；苏联医药科学院院士：神经科医生纳·维·科诺瓦洛夫教授，内科医生阿·勒·米亚斯尼科夫教授，内科医生叶·麦·塔列耶夫教授；神经科医生伊·纳·菲利莫诺夫教授；神经科医生鲁·阿·特卡切夫教授；神经科医生伊·斯·格拉茹诺夫教授；内科医生维·伊·伊凡诺夫—涅兹纳莫夫讲师。对斯大林同志疾病的诊疗是在苏联卫生部部长阿·弗·特雷季雅科夫和克里姆林宫医疗卫生处处长伊·伊·库帕林的领导下进行的。
    对斯大林同志疾病的诊疗是在苏联共产党中央委员会和苏维埃政府的经常监督之下进行的。
    鉴于斯大林同志的健康的严重情况，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议认为有必要从今天起开始发布关于约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林的健康情况的诊断公报。
    由于斯大林同志的严重疾病，他势必要在或长或短的时间内不能参加领导活动，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议，和我们全党以及我们全体苏维埃人民一样，都认识到这一事实的全部意义。
    中央委员会和部长会议在领导党和国家的时候，极其严肃地考虑到由于斯大林同志暂时不参加国家和党的领导活动而引起的一切情况。
    中央委员会和部长会议相信：在这些困难的日子里，我们的党和全体苏维埃人民一定会表现出最大的团结和一致、坚决的精神和警惕性，一定会加倍努力地从事我国的共产主义建设，一定会更加紧密地团结在共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围。
