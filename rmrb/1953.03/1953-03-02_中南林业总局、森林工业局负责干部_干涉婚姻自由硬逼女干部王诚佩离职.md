Responsible cadres of the Central-South Forestry Administration and the Forestry Industry Bureau
Interfere with Marital Freedom, Forcing Female Cadre Wang Chengpei to Resign

Responsible cadres of the Central-South Forestry Administration, specifically the Director of the Central-South Forestry Administration Zhao Yunong, and the Deputy Manager of the Central-South Timber Company (now renamed the Central-South Forestry Industry Bureau, co-located with the Central-South Forestry Administration) Li Ming, and cadres Wang Dongming, Wang Dalai, Li Qi, Zhang Shufang and others interfered with the marital freedom of Wang Chengpei, a female cadre of the Central-South Timber Company, and "purged" her through "voluntary resignation." Wang Chengpei, due to interference with her marriage and repeated insults and attacks, attempted suicide. After receiving Wang Chengpei's anonymous accusation letter, the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee immediately sent people to investigate and proved that the situation reflected by Wang Chengpei was completely true. However, several responsible cadres of the Central-South Forestry Administration and the Central-South Forestry Industry Bureau have been shirking responsibility and still refuse to admit their mistakes.

Wang Chengpei is a cashier of the former Central-South Timber Company, currently nineteen years old. In December 1951, she went to study at the Lushan Forestry Training Class affiliated with the Central-South Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Forestry Administration and had a romantic relationship with trainee Li Jikui. Li Jikui was already married but concealed this from the organization and deceived Wang Chengpei. After being exposed by classmates, she immediately broke off the relationship with Li. Later, she became closer to trainees Chen Guifang and Zhang Guangli, which aroused dissatisfaction among some people with feudal ideas. In June 1952, during the ideological summary at the end of the study, instructors Li Jinxi and Hao Chaofan of the training class used meetings and individual talks for more than ten consecutive days to struggle against her. They forced Wang Chengpei to admit that she had a sexual relationship with Li Jikui, and threatened her by saying that if she did not admit it, her ideological summary would not be approved, and she would not be allowed to graduate. Wang Dalai, the director of the training class, also deceived her by saying, "Li Jikui has already admitted it." In fact, both Li and Wang had consistently denied such a thing. During the struggle, Wang Chengpei did not eat for several meals and attempted to jump out of the window to commit suicide. However, the leaders of the training class believed that Wang Chengpei was using suicide to threaten the organization and held another meeting to struggle against her. Finally, the director of the training class, Wang Dalai, announced that Wang Chengpei would be given a demerit and prepared to "purge" her.

When the trainees of the training class went to the Central-South Forestry Administration to wait for work assignments, the leading cadres of the administration initially believed that Wang Chengpei's "style was not good" and did not intend to employ her. Later, they felt that she still had some ability, so Zhang Shufang (female), a cadre of the personnel section of the administration, asked her to write a guarantee that she would "never fall in love again" before assigning her to work at the original Central-South Timber Company. Forcing her to write such a guarantee is a complete violation of national laws and is unreasonable. Therefore, in August 1952, Wang Chengpei fell in love with Mao Zhenyi, a former colleague at the Salt Bureau. One Sunday, Wang Chengpei used the excuse of going home and went to Wuchang with Mao Zhenyi to play. Sun Gengyin, a cadre of the personnel section of the company, and He Zicheng, a cadre of the industrial management section, went to her home to investigate and found that she had not returned home. Later, they saw her returning to the company with shirts and undershirts and questioned her about where she had gone and where the things came from. Wang Chengpei was very panicked and afraid of being fired, so she admitted it. He Zicheng threatened her by saying, "Go out less in the future, and don't get close to Mao Zhenyi again; otherwise, you will be fired in the newspaper." Sun Gengyin also used the guise of helping her and asked her to write an ideological diary every day for him to check. Wang Chengpei accepted everything and wrote a letter to Mao Zhenyi, expressing that she would no longer associate with him. Mao Zhenyi felt that things were very sudden and wrote letters and made phone calls to her repeatedly, and also entrusted people to find her, but she dared not answer the phone or meet him. A letter written to her by Mao Zhenyi was illegally opened by Wei Yangling, the chief of the general affairs section of the company, and everyone was allowed to read it. During this period, Xiao Xuxian, the instructor of the accounting training class of the company, asked Wang Chengpei to go to the movies several times. She was afraid of making a "mistake" and dared not go at first, but later she went. Xiao then asked her to dance and eat watermelon, expressing his affection for her. Later, Xiao proposed to her, but she dared not accept. Xiao told her that the Marriage Law guaranteed that love was legal. Considering that Xiao was a Communist Party member and a disabled revolutionary soldier, she agreed to marry him. Xiao Xuxian then submitted a request to the administrative leaders to marry Wang. However, Zhang Shufang, a cadre of the personnel section, and He Zicheng, a cadre of the industrial management section, proposed to Li Ming, the deputy manager of the company: Wang Chengpei is "messing around" again, and asked her to voluntarily resign. Li Ming not only did not criticize this erroneous opinion, but instead expressed that he wanted to hold a mass meeting to deal with it, "in order to educate the cadres." Then, Zhang and He found Wang Chengpei for a talk, telling her: You guaranteed not to fall in love in the past, but now you are messing around with love again. Okay, you quickly write a voluntary resignation request. He Zicheng also told her: "You know your mistakes, if you are formally fired in the newspaper, you will have no future." They immediately asked her to hand over her work and dismissed her from her position (around the beginning of September). Wang Chengpei was unwilling to resign and cried to Wang Dongming, the director of the office, saying: "As long as I don't leave the organization, I am willing to be struggled against at a meeting." Wang Dongming asked her to examine herself carefully so that she would not have to resign and immediately sent three cadres, including Dan Zhaoluan and Wei Zhi, to monitor her. Wang Chengpei wrote three self-criticism guarantees in succession, but none of them passed. Later, Wang Dongming told her how the guarantee should be written and personally revised it for her. This guarantee had seven articles, of which articles four, five, and six stipulated: "I will never go out privately for a minute for no reason, and I must be picked up or receive a letter from home on Saturdays and Sundays before going back. I will always take the eight sisters, including Dan Zhaoluan, Wei Zhi, Chen Zimin, Zhang Shufang, and Li Qi, as guardians and supporters. If anything happens, I must go through these supporters. From now on, I will break off relations with everyone who has a romantic relationship with me. ...After working for a certain period of time, the organization will take care of me, and I will never fall in love privately." Article seven stipulated: "If I violate it, I will be warned, given a demerit, fired, and even subject to legal punishment." The above-mentioned eight so-called "guardians and supporters" were also proposed by Wang Dongming. After this guarantee was approved by Wang Dongming, it was handed over to Li Qi, a cadre of the personnel section, for handling. Li Qi felt that it was difficult to handle and delayed for more than two weeks before ordering Sun Gengyin of the section to mobilize Wang Chengpei to go home. Wang Chengpei was in great mental pain and attempted suicide again. After learning about this, Sun Gengyin reported it to Vice Director Wang Zigui and Deputy Manager Li Ming. However, they insisted that she voluntarily resign and go home. Wang Chengpei was forced to write a "voluntary" resignation request. The resignation certificate issued to Wang Chengpei by the Forestry Industry Bureau was shown to Director Zhao Yunong by Sun Gengyin.

As early as before Wang Chengpei and Xiao Xuxian fell in love, Sun Gengyin had also expressed his admiration for Wang Chengpei. After she resigned and went home, Sun Gengyin took the initiative to approach her, proposed to her, and encouraged her by saying that love was in accordance with the Marriage Law. Sun Gengyin clearly understood the Marriage Law, but when Wang Chengpei was in love with someone else, he echoed those with feudal ideas and interfered. This bad behavior was also not criticized or dealt with.

During the process of the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee sending people to investigate and deal with this incident, the relevant cadres of the Forestry Administration and the Forestry Industry Bureau generally had a resistant attitude, shirking responsibility to each other, and some even argued strongly and continued to insult Wang Chengpei in public. Wang Dalai, the former director of the training class, did not admit that the demerit given to Wang Chengpei in the training class was interfering with marital freedom, but believed that Wang had violated the "rule of not allowing love" in the training class. Li Qi (female), a cadre of the personnel section of the company, also said: "I have never seen such a female comrade who takes the initiative to find a man." The cadres of the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee criticized their feudal ideas and illegal behavior, but Wang Dalai did not accept these criticisms and instead resisted. He disagreed with the opinion of the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee to reinstate Wang Chengpei's work. After the cadres of the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee took multiple testimonies, clarified the truth of the facts, and compiled an investigation report, several responsible cadres of the two units still believed that there were "major discrepancies." The Central-South People's Supervisory Committee formally notified Director Zhao Yunong to attend a meeting, but he did not attend and only asked someone to send a message saying: "He has objections to the materials." Deputy Manager Li Ming repeatedly claimed that it had nothing to do with him and wrote written materials to appeal everywhere, saying that he
"Besides being surprised, he expressed regret." Nevertheless, the cadres of the unit could not deny the series of erroneous facts of struggling against, giving demerits, forcing to write guarantees, and finally "purging" Wang Chengpei, because there were witnesses and material evidence. At present, the Central-South People's Supervisory Committee has put forward handling opinions and is reporting them to the Central-South Administrative Committee for approval.

    中南林业总局、森林工业局负责干部
    干涉婚姻自由硬逼女干部王诚佩离职
    中南林业总局局长赵雨农和该局所属中南木材公司（现改为中南森林工业局，与中南林业总局合署办公）副经理李明、干部王东明、王大来、李淇、张淑芳等干涉中南木材公司女干部王诚佩的婚姻自由，并用“自动离职”的方式将她“清洗”。王诚佩因婚姻问题受人干涉，且三番五次地受到侮辱和打击，曾经企图自杀。中南人民监察委员会在接到王诚佩的匿名控告信后，立即派人进行调查，证明王诚佩所反映的情况完全属实。但中南林业总局和中南森林工业局的几个负责干部，却一直推卸责任，至今不肯承认错误。
    王诚佩是原中南木材公司的出纳，现年十九岁。一九五一年十二月，她到中南农林部林业总局所属庐山林业训练班学习，曾经和学员李纪奎发生恋爱关系。李纪奎原已结婚，但他隐瞒了组织，也欺骗了王诚佩。经同学揭发后，她即与李断绝了关系。其后她又和学员陈贵芳、张广立比较接近，引起部分有封建思想的人对她不满。一九五二年六月，在作学习结束的思想总结时，训练班辅导员李金玺、郝超凡等，连续十多天用开会和个别谈话等方式斗争她。他们硬逼王诚佩承认曾和李纪奎发生过性的关系，并威胁她说：如果不承认，就不通过她的思想总结，不准她毕业。训练班辅导主任王大来也欺骗她说：“李纪奎早已承认了。”事实上，李、王二人均一直否认有这种事。在被斗争的过程中，王诚佩几顿没有吃饭，还企图跳窗自杀。但训练班的领导人反认为王诚佩是用自杀来威胁组织，又开会斗争她。最后辅导主任王大来宣布，给予王诚佩记大过一次的处分，并准备“清洗”她。
    训练班的学员到中南林业总局等候分配工作时，该局领导干部最初也认为王诚佩“作风不好”，不打算用她。后来又觉得她还有些能力，由该局人事科干部张淑芳（女）让她写了一个“以后再不谈恋爱”的保证书，才分配她到原中南木材公司工作。逼写这样的保证书，是完全违反国家的法令，而且不合情理的。因此在一九五二年八月，王诚佩和过去在盐务局的同事毛震仪发生恋爱。有一个星期天，王诚佩借口回家，同毛震仪到武昌去玩。该公司人事科干部孙庚寅和工管科干部贺子诚随后到她家去调查，发现她并未回家，以后又看见她回公司时带有衬衫、汗衫，便追问她到那里去了，东西是从那里来的。王诚佩很恐慌，怕被开除，便承认了。贺子诚就恐吓她说：“以后少出去，不要再和毛震仪接近；否则便要登报开除。”孙庚寅也假借帮助为名，要她每天写思想日记，交他检查。王诚佩一一接受，写了一封信给毛震仪，表示不再和他来往。毛震仪因感到事情很突然，一再写信、打电话给她，又委托人去找她，她不敢接电话，也不敢接见。毛震仪写给她的一封信，还被该公司总务科长魏仰凌非法拆看了，并让大家都看了。在这期间，该公司会计训练班辅导员肖旭贤，几次请王诚佩去看电影。她怕犯“错误”，开始不敢去，后来才去了。肖又请她跳舞、吃西瓜，对她表示好感。以后肖向她求婚，她不敢接受。肖对她说有婚姻法做保障，恋爱是合法的。她考虑到肖是个共产党员，又是革命残废军人，便同意和他结婚。肖旭贤就向行政领导上提出和王结婚的请求。但人事科干部张淑芳和工管科干部贺子诚向该公司副经理李明提出：王诚佩又“乱搞”，叫她自动离职。李明不但没有批评这种错误意见，反而表示要开群众大会处理，“借以教育干部”。其后即由张、贺二人找王诚佩谈话，对她说：你过去保证不恋爱，现在又乱谈恋爱。好吧，你赶快写自动请求离职书。贺子诚还对她说：“你的错误你知道，如果正式登报开除，你就更没有前途。”他们立刻叫她移交工作，解除了她的职务（约在九月初）。王诚佩不愿离职，向办公室主任王东明哭诉说：“只要不脱离组织，愿受大会斗争。”王东明要她好好地检讨一下，可以不离职，并随即派但昭鸾和魏智等三个干部监视她。王诚佩接连写了三次检讨保证书，都通不过。以后王东明告诉她保证书应该怎样写，并亲自替她作了修改。这个保证书共七条，其中四、五、六三条规定：“无事决不私出一分钟，星期六和星期天一定要家中来接或来信才回去。经常以但昭鸾、魏智、陈子民、张淑芳、李淇等八个姐姐作监护扶导人。有什么事，一定要通过这些扶导人。今后与一切和我有恋爱关系者断绝关系。……在工作了一定时候以后，组织给我照顾，决不私自谈恋爱。”第七条规定：“如违背了就受警告、记过、开除以至法律的处分。”上面所说的那八个所谓“监护扶导人”，也是王东明提出来的。这一保证书经王东明认可后，即交人事科干部李淇处理。李淇因感到不好处理，拖延了两个多星期以后，责成该科孙庚寅动员王诚佩回家。王诚佩因精神上很痛苦，又企图自杀。孙庚寅知道此事后，向王子谷副局长和李明副经理汇报过。但他们坚持要她自动离职回家。王诚佩被逼得没有办法，只好写了“自动”离职请求书。森林工业局发给王诚佩的离职证明书，由孙庚寅交赵雨农局长看过。
    早在王诚佩和肖旭贤恋爱以前，孙庚寅也曾经向王诚佩表示过爱慕。等她离职回家后，孙庚寅又主动接近她，向她求婚，并鼓励她说，恋爱是合乎婚姻法的。孙庚寅明明懂得婚姻法，但在王诚佩与别人恋爱时，他却附和着有封建思想的人进行干涉。这种恶劣的行为，也没有受到批评和处理。
    在中南人民监察委员会派人检查处理这一事件的过程中，该林业总局和森林工业局的有关干部普遍有抵抗情绪，互相推卸责任，有人甚至强词夺理，仍然当众污辱王诚佩。原训练班辅导主任王大来对于王诚佩在训练班被记一大过一事，他不承认是干涉婚姻自由，而认为是王违犯了训练班“不许恋爱的纪律”。该公司人事科干部李淇（女）也说：“没有看见过这样的女同志，主动找男人。”中南人民监察委员会的干部批评了他们的封建思想和违法行为，但王大来对这些批评都不接受，反而抗拒。他不同意中南人民监察委员会提出的恢复王诚佩工作的意见。当中南人民监察委员会的干部多方对证，查清事实真相，并整理出调查报告以后，该两单位的几个负责干部仍然认为“出入很大”。中南人民监察委员会正式通知赵雨农局长开会，他也不出席，只托人带口信说：“他对材料有意见。”李明副经理则一再推说与他无关，并写出书面的东西到处申诉，说他
    “除表惊异以外，并表示遗憾”。虽然如此，但该单位的干部却始终不能否认对王诚佩斗争、记过、逼迫写保证书以及最后加以“清洗”等一系列的错误事实，因为人证物证俱在。目前，中南人民监察委员会已提出处理意见，正报请中南行政委员会批示。
