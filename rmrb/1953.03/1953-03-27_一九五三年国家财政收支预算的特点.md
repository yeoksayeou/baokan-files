The 1953 national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget has been unanimously approved by the 23rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. This budget is not only a budget for production and construction, but also a budget for improving the people's welfare. To better understand it, we can conduct further research on the following aspects.

	I. Theoretical Understanding

It should be particularly pointed out that the fiscal revenue and expenditure budget of New China is compiled on a very solid foundation, and the 1953 budget is based on the great achievements made in the recovery phase of the past three years, so it is bound to have more substantial progress. This year is better than last year, and next year will definitely be better than this year. Facing such a people's budget that is fundamentally different from the budgets of capitalist countries, it is absolutely necessary to first understand it theoretically.

Here, we make the following analysis of our national budget from a theoretical perspective:

(1) As everyone knows, a budget is a concrete reflection of the policies a country wants to implement in a specific period. Whether a country needs peace or war, there is no need to listen to or read its lengthy reports. Just unfold its budget, and everything will be clear. Because countries that need peace are bound to devote themselves to national construction, their budget expenditures are also bound to focus on economic construction expenses; while countries that love war will inevitably devote all their efforts to military expenses. Our country's foreign policy is a peaceful foreign policy, so our budget is also based on production and construction.

(2) A budget is not only about having more income, but also about having more expenditure, but it has a principle that must be strictly followed, which is to ensure a balance between revenue and expenditure. The budget of a people's country is taken from the people and used for the people. The more income, the more funds can be used for economic and cultural construction. The more economic and cultural construction expenditures, the higher the social productivity will be. Once productivity is improved, the corresponding purchasing power will inevitably increase, so the people's culture, life, and welfare will all improve day by day. Our national budget is exactly like this, so it is not only a budget for production and construction, but also a budget for improving the people's welfare.

(3) The best national budget, in order to benefit the people, will inevitably have a proportion of administrative and defense expenditures that is smaller than the proportion of national construction expenditures in its expenditure section. In the past, only the Soviet Union had such a budget, but now, we and the new democratic countries that are on the same path as us have achieved this. This is a new victory for the Chinese people.

(4) Because our budget is not consumption-oriented but production-oriented, it also plays a role of increasing continuously in a causal cycle. Because based on the principle of taking from the people and using for the people, the more we get, the more we use, so the greater the productivity; conversely, the greater the productivity, the greater the purchasing power, and the more the culture, life, and welfare are improved, so the more the national income. This kind of causal cycle transforms each other until it is inexhaustible.

However, some people seem to have insufficient understanding of this point. For example, after Comrade Bo Yibo's report was published in the newspaper, because his report pointed out that there might be a surplus of more than 30 trillion yuan in 1952, some people then thought that this might be the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" refund figures. In fact, if you can study it carefully, this kind of erroneous argument will not exist. Because this refund figure was not included in the 1952 budget, but was included in other income in 1953, and its amount is only 3 trillion, less than one-tenth of the 1952 surplus figure (the budget surplus is 2,605.95 billion, plus about 400 billion that was not used after the allocation of funds by various agencies and organizations), and even less than one-fourteenth of the balance of 4,422.10 billion that the 1953 budget income part exceeds the 1952 income part. Although this is not a small number, it is not overly important when it is placed in the national budget.

(5) Before 1949, when the liberated areas were still limited to rural areas, almost all national income relied on public grain, that is to say, all burdens fell on the peasants. After the nationwide liberation, the cities returned to the hands of the people. Since the objective situation has changed, the scope of the burden must of course change accordingly. At this time, the first place in the national budget income part was slowly replaced by industrial and commercial tax, which was the first stage. And now, the second stage has begun. In this stage, the first place in the national budget income will no longer be industrial and commercial tax, but will be gradually replaced by the income of state-owned enterprises and the income of credit insurance. This shows the continuous growth of the leading position of the working class and the state-owned economy in the national economic life.

(6) From the revenue and expenditure of the budget, it can also be seen that there is no similarity between us and American imperialism. In the United States, almost all of the national fiscal revenue falls on the increasingly impoverished people, while the millionaires who make profits every day do not contribute a penny. In terms of expenditure, in order to satisfy the desires of a few monopoly capitalists to carry out aggression and pursue maximum profits, the US budget spends a lot of money to order military supplies to maintain its crumbling hegemony; a large number of banknotes are issued to make up for its budget deficit, so inflation, high prices, reduced purchasing power, reduced civil production, worker unemployment, and difficult life, etc., will inevitably befall the miserable American people. This is difficult to compare with the fortunate encounters of our Chinese people.

	II. Factual Evidence

It is not enough to only make the above analysis. Here, we can also cite some concrete facts and figures to further understand the superiority of our country's budget.

Let's start with the income aspect of the 1953 budget. For the sake of easy analysis, I have listed the estimated income number for 1952 and the budgeted income number for 1953 in the following table: (See attached table)

From this table, it can be seen that the percentage increase in the 1953 budget income compared to 1952 is the largest for state-owned enterprise income, with a percentage increase of 5.36%; followed by credit insurance income, which also increased by 3.07%. The third is industrial and commercial taxes (including salt tax, customs duties, circulation tax, stamp tax, interest income tax, slaughter tax, transaction tax, etc.). The percentage in 1953 is 1.01% higher than in 1952, while agricultural tax and other taxes have decreased. If we use specific numbers to illustrate these growth situations, it is as follows: (See attached table)

Note: The unit of the numbers in the estimated income and budgeted income items is 100 million yuan.

This table clearly tells us that from the perspective of absolute numbers, various tax revenues are not decreasing but increasing, but their growth rate is very slow. State-owned enterprise income is not like this, it is growing very fast, and credit insurance income is growing even faster, which strongly illustrates the important position and leading role of state-owned enterprises.

In addition, we can also see that the agricultural tax in the 1953 budget only increased by 0.23%, which shows that the state is consciously taking care of farmers in the budget income, stabilizing the burden on farmers to facilitate farmers' production.

Now, let's talk about the expenditure aspect again. (See attached table)

What is most noteworthy in this table is the reduction in defense expenditure. As is well known, at the time when Eisenhower was hoarsely calling for the expansion of the war of aggression against Korea, our defense expenditure in the budget was actually reduced. What does this show? This also shows the superiority of our new democratic economy. That is to say, the aggression of US imperialism not only did not affect our construction, but also allowed us to draw strength to carry out economic construction without affecting our national defense strength. This is something we can be proud of.

Secondly, although the increase or decrease in the percentages listed in this table is not much in two years, it can also be understood in the same way. If we look at the absolute numbers, the increase in various construction funds is astonishing. The following is a comparison of the 1953 expenditure budget and the 1952 estimated expenditure: (See attached table)

Note: The unit of the numbers in the estimated expenditure and budgeted expenditure items is 100 million yuan.

It can be seen from this table that in the 1953 budget, compared with 1952 in terms of absolute numbers, except for the other expenditure item, which decreased, the rest have increased, and the most increased is the national construction fee.

In the expenditure part of the budget, the national construction fee includes two items: national economic construction fee and social, cultural and educational construction fee. The use of cultural and educational construction fee is just as its meaning suggests, and there is no need to explain it much. However, the national economic construction fee is not simple. What exactly is economic construction? Everyone will definitely think that this of course refers to production construction. However, this answer is actually only half correct, because what we are going to carry out is not general production construction, such as light industry construction, agricultural production construction, etc., but is focusing on heavy industry construction, which includes the steel industry, chemical industry, machinery industry, fuel industry, geological exploration, construction engineering, railway construction, etc. In the 1953 budget expenditure, the national construction fee accounts for 59.24%, plus a part of the general reserve fee will inevitably flow into this item, then the national construction fee has exceeded 60%. A country can use so much money to engage in meaningful economic and cultural construction, which will be a great force. It can not only improve our country's productivity, improve the people's purchasing power, and improve the living and cultural standards of our people, but will also further change the backwardness of our country's economic situation.

Finally, we can also study the essence of the US budget and its basic differences from our country's budget. In the US imperialist budget for the accounting year 1952-1953, 48.5% of its income came from individual direct taxes, and in the expenditure part, the direct expenditure on military equipment alone reached 58.2 billion US dollars, accounting for 74% of the total expenditure. In a budget like theirs, although it is taken from the people, it is used for themselves (referring to the big bosses on Wall Street). Under such a budget, small industries are strangled, and large daily necessities and livelihood industries are transformed into war industries. Big bosses sit back and enjoy huge profits in the flying military order forms, while the people gasp for breath under the high pressure of heavy taxes and high prices, paying money, contributing labor, and even sacrificing their lives.

And what about the Chinese people living in the new democratic country? Thanks to the smooth development of various economic undertakings, our lives have been greatly improved in three years. For example, employees in state-owned enterprises across the country in 1952 received a general wage increase. According to preliminary statistics, the wages of employees in state-owned enterprises generally increased by 11-36% compared with 1951, and the wages of state agency staff also increased by 15-31% compared with 1951. This is still only in terms of monetary wages. If we look at actual income, it has increased even more. For example, in 1952, the state spent 1.6 trillion yuan on labor insurance and 2.86 trillion yuan on the construction of workers' dormitories, building more than 217,000 houses that can accommodate 1 million people. In addition, there have also been great improvements in medicine, health, entertainment, and life. All of these are what the American people are eager to want but have not yet been able to get.

Therefore, whether from a theoretical or factual point of view, we can fully understand that the 1953 budget is indeed a production, construction, and also a budget that improves the people's welfare. This good budget is inseparable from the good new democratic political system. Let us cheer for the victory of the new democratic system!

    一九五三年国家财政收支预算的特点
    马寅初
    一九五三年国家财政收支预算已经中央人民政府委员会第二十三次会议一致通过了。这个预算不仅是生产的预算，建设的预算，而且是增进人民福利的预算。为了更好地认识它，我们可就以下各方面作更进一步的研究。
        一  理论上的认识
    应该特别指出，新中国的财政收支预算是在十分巩固的基础上编制的，而一九五三年的预算又是以过去三年恢复阶段所获得伟大成就为其基础，因而它必然有更长足的进步。今年的比去年进步，而明年的一定会比今年更进步。面对着这么一种与资本主义体系国家预算根本不同的人民预算，首先从理论上去认识它，这是完全必要的。
    兹就理论上，把我们的国家预算作如下的分析：
    （一）谁都知道，预算是一个国家在一个特定时期中要执行的政策的具体反映，一个国家所需要的是和平或是战争，用不着听或是读他的那些冗长的报告，只需摊开他的预算，就一切都明白了。因为需要和平的国家，必然致力于国家建设，因而他的预算支出也必然是偏重于经济建设费用；而爱好战争的国家，就必然倾全力于军事费用。我国外交政策是和平的外交政策，所以我国的预算也就是以生产和建设为主。
    （二）预算不仅是收入得越多越好，支出也是越多越好，但它有一个必须绝对遵行的原则，就是要保证收支平衡。人民国家的预算是取之于民用之于民的，收入越多，可用于经济、文化建设的经费也越多，经济、文化建设支出越多，社会生产力就越高，而生产力一经提高，与之相适应的购买力就必然提高，从而人民的文化、生活、福利在在都日益向上。我们的国家预算就正是这样的，因此它不仅是生产、建设的预算，也是增进人民福利的预算。
    （三）一个最好的国家预算，为了造福人群，在它的支出部分，行政费和国防费必然是比例地小于国家建设费的。像这样的预算，过去只有苏联才有，而现在，我们以及和我们同路的新民主主义国家都做到了这一步。这是中国人民的一个新的胜利。
    （四）由于我们的预算不是消费性而是生产性的，因而它还起着因果相循日益扩大的作用。因为本着取之于民用之于民的原则，取得越多用得也越多，所以生产力也越大；反过来说，生产力越大，购买力也越大，文化、生活、福利也越益增进，从而国家收入也越多。这样因果相循相互转化，直至取之不尽用之不竭。
    但是，有些人对于这一点似乎是认识不足的，例如当报上发表了薄一波同志的报告后，因他的报告中曾指出一九五二年可能节余三十万亿元以上，有些人于是乎就连想到这可能是“三反”“五反”退补数字。事实上如果能仔细研究一下，这种错误论调是不会有的。因为这笔退补数字在一九五二年的预算中并未打入，而是打入一九五三年其他收入中的，且它的数目仅是三万亿，不及一九五二年节余数字（预算节余二六○五九五亿，加上各机关团体拨款后未用去的约四○○○○亿）的十分之一，更不及一九五三年预算收入部分超过一九五二年收入部分余额四四二二一○亿的十四分之一。虽然这并不是一个小数目，但是当它被排列在国家预算中，却是并不过分重要的。
    （五）一九四九年以前，那时解放区还仅限于农村，国家收入差不多全靠公粮，也就是说所有负担都落在农民的身上。全国解放后，城市回到人民的手里。客观情况既已改变，负担面当然要随之改变，这时国家预算收入部分的第一位慢慢地由工商税取而代之了，这是第一阶段。而现在，第二阶段开始了，在这一阶段中，占国家预算收入第一位的，将不再是工商业税，而由国营企业收入和信贷保险收入逐步替代了。这说明工人阶级和国营经济在国民经济生活中的领导地位的不断增长。
    （六）从预算的收支中还可以看出，我们和美帝国主义之间是没有丝毫相同之处的。在美国，整个国家的财政收入差不多全数落在日益穷困的人民身上，而日盈累万的富翁却是一毛不拔。再从支出来说，为了满足少数垄断资本家进行侵掠并追取最大限度利润的欲望，美国的预算支出了大量资金来订购军火，以维持其摇摇欲坠的霸权；发行了大量钞票，以弥补其预算赤字，于是乎通货膨胀、物价高涨、购买力减退、民用生产减少、工人失业、生活困难等等的厄运就必然临到了悲苦的美国人民的头上。这和我们中国人民的幸运遭遇，是万难比拟的。
         二  事实的佐证
    仅作以上的分析是还不够的，这里我们还可以引证一些具体的事实和数字，俾能更进一步地认识我国预算的优越性。
    先从一九五三年预算的收入方面谈起罢。为了便于分析起见，我把一九五二年的预计收入数和一九五三年的预算收入数列表于后：（附图表）
    从这个表里可以看出，一九五三年预算收入百分比较一九五二年增加最多的是国营企业收入，它的百分比增长了百分之五·三六；其次是信贷保险收入，它也增长了百分之三·○七。再次是工商各税（包括盐税、关税、流通税、印花税、利息所得税、屠宰税、交易税等）一九五三年的百分比要比一九五二年增加百分之一·○一，而农业税和其他税收则都减少了。如果用具体数字来说明这些增长的情况，则如下表：（附图表）
    注：预计收入和预算收入项中的数字单位为亿元。
    这个表清楚地告诉我们，从绝对数字上看，各项税收并不是减退而是增长的，不过它的增长速度很慢。国营企业收入就不是这样，它增长得很快，而信贷保险收入则增长得更快，这就十分有力地说明了国营企业的重要地位及其领导作用。
    此外，我们还可以看出，一九五三年预算中农业税只增长了百分之○·二三，这说明国家是有意识地在预算收入上照顾农民，稳定农民负担以利农民的生产。
    现在，我们再从支出方面来谈罢。（附图表）
    这个表最值得注意的是国防费支出的缩减。如所周知，正当艾森豪威尔声嘶力竭地高叫扩大侵朝战争的年头，我们预算中的国防支出居然缩减了，这说明什么呢？这也说明了我们新民主主义经济的优越性。这就是，美帝国主义的侵略不仅没有影响我们建设的进行，而且还可以在不影响国防实力的情况下抽出力量来进行经济建设，这是足资我们骄傲的。
    其次，这个表上所列百分数两年间增减虽然不多，但同样可以理解，如按绝对数字来说，各项建设经费的增加则是惊人的。下面就是一九五三年支出预算和一九五二年预计支出数的比较：（附图表）
    注：预计支出和预算支出项中的数字单位为亿元。
    从这个表中可以看出，一九五三年预算中，按照绝对数字与一九五二年作比较，除其他支出一项降低外，其余都是增加的，而增加最多的则是国家建设费。
    在预算的支出部分，国家建设费这一项下包括国民经济建设费和社会文教建设费两款，文教建设费的用途正如它的文意，用不着多所解释，而国民经济建设费就不简单了。到底什么是经济建设呢？大家一定会想到，这当然是指生产建设而言的。但是，这种回答事实上只对了一半，因为我们所要进行的还不是一般的生产建设，诸如轻工业建设、农业生产建设等等，而是着重在重工业建设，它包括钢铁工业、化学工业、机械工业、燃料工业、地质勘察、建设工程、铁路建设等。一九五三年预算支出中，国家建设费占百分之五九·二四，加上总预备费中必然会有一部分流入这一项目，则国家建设费已超过百分之六十，一个国家能够用这么多的资金来从事有决定意义的经济和文化建设，这将是一个多末大的力量，它不仅能提高我国的生产力，提高人民的购买力，提高我国人民的生活、文化水平，而且还将进一步改变我国经济状况落后的面貌。
    最后，我们还可以来研究一下美国预算的本质，以及它和我国预算的基本差异。在美帝国主义一九五二—一九五三年这一会计年度的预算中，其收入分有百分之四八·五的来源是个人直接税，而支出部分，仅直接用于军备费用的即达五百八十二亿美元，占总支出的百分之七十四，像他们那样的预算，虽取之于民，却用之于己（指华尔街的大老板们）。在这样的预算下面，小工业被扼杀了，大的日用民生工业又转化为战争工业，大老板在军事订货单的飞舞中坐食暴利，人民则喘息于税重物贵的高压下，出钱、出力甚至出命。
    而生活在新民主主义国家中的中国人民呢？由于各种经济事业的顺利发展，我们的生活在三年中已有了很大的提高，例如一九五二年全国国营企业中的员工，就曾获得一次普遍地增加工资，据初步统计，国营企业中员工所得工资比一九五一年一般增加了百分之十一—三六，国家机关工作人员的工资也较一九五一年增加了百分之十五—三一。这还是仅以货币工资来说的，若以实际收入来说，那就增加得更多了。如一九五二年国家用在劳动保险方面的经费有一万六千亿元，用在工人宿舍建设的经费有二万八千六百亿元，计建造了二十一万七千多间房屋，能容一百万人居住。此外，在医药、卫生、文娱、生活等方面，也都有了很大的改善。所有这些，都是美国人民所急切想望而暂时还得不到的。
    所以，无论从理论上或是事实上，我们都可以十分明白，一九五三年的预算的的确确是一个生产的、建设的，同时也是增进人民福利的预算。这个好的预算是和好的新民主主义政治制度分不开的，让我们为新民主主义制度的胜利而欢呼吧！
