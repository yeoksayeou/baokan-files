People's Supervisory Organs at All Levels Must Conscientiously Supervise and Inspect the Implementation of the Marriage Law
Tan Pingshan, Director of the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council

The movement to implement the Marriage Law has been launched throughout the country. The movement to implement the Marriage Law is a major social reform. It aims to abolish the feudal marriage system and establish a new democratic marriage system. It is not only related to the happiness of every individual and every family, but also to the development of national construction and the physical and mental health of future generations. Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China three years ago, although many achievements have been made in the work of implementing the Marriage Law in various places, in most parts of the country, the feudal marriage system, the feudal idea of ​​valuing men over women, and various misunderstandings of the Marriage Law arising therefrom still seriously exist. This situation must be changed. Now, the land reform in the countryside and the democratic reforms in factories and mines in the cities have been basically completed. The level of awareness of the people has been generally improved. The vast number of young men and women not only have an urgent demand for marriage liberation, but also have the courage to fight against the feudal marriage system; at the same time, our country's economic construction is beginning. This construction task is glorious and arduous, and it is necessary to give play to the political enthusiasm or production enthusiasm of the broad masses of people to ensure the victorious completion of this task. First of all, the vast productive forces bound by the feudal marriage system must be liberated. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government have issued instructions stipulating that a movement to publicize the Marriage Law and check the implementation of the Marriage Law should be launched on a large scale throughout the country in March this year (except in ethnic minority areas and areas where land reform has not yet been completed). This is very timely and necessary. People's governments and people's organizations at all levels must recognize the political significance of this movement, attach importance to this movement, and earnestly implement it in accordance with the instructions.

However, the movement to implement the Marriage Law is different from other social reform movements. It is entirely a matter of the people themselves, a matter of the people themselves rising up to oppose the feudal ideas in their minds. This problem cannot be completely solved in one movement. It must be gradually resolved through long-term publicity and education work. In this movement, we must never adopt a crude and impetuous attitude and methods of class struggle. If the methods of dealing with the enemy are mistakenly used within the people, it will inevitably cause panic among the masses, create social chaos, affect people's unity, and cause the movement to fail. Therefore, we should strengthen the supervision and inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law, carefully grasp the policies, and carry out propaganda correctly, so that the movement can move forward steadily and achieve the expected goals.

Guaranteeing the implementation of the Marriage Law is one of the important responsibilities of the people's supervisory organs. Over the past three years, people's supervisory organs at all levels have inspected and handled many cases involving cadres' implementation of the Marriage Law. In 1951, they cooperated with relevant organs to inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law in various places, which played a certain role in promoting and implementing the Marriage Law.

In this movement to implement the Marriage Law, in addition to assigning capable cadres to participate in the work of the office of the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council, people's supervisory organs at all levels should also earnestly do the following work:

1.  Study the Marriage Law. Supervisory staff at all levels must study the Marriage Law and relevant instructions for this movement. Through the study of these documents, they should gain an ideological understanding of the harm of the feudal marriage system, the benefits of the new democratic marriage system, clearly distinguish the boundaries between the old and new marriage systems, and understand the purpose, guidelines and policies of this movement to implement the Marriage Law, as well as the great significance of implementing the Marriage Law for developing production and building the country. Only by understanding these principles can we correctly publicize the Marriage Law and correctly handle marriage cases involving government workers.

2.  Inspection work. This should be approached from two aspects: On the one hand, we should inspect the work of supervising and inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law, that is, check whether the supervision and inspection work of implementing the Marriage Law was valued in the past, whether there were any achievements, and summarize experience and improve work; on the other hand, we should check whether the handling of relevant marriage cases in the past was serious and correct. If there are any incorrect ones, we must be responsible for correcting them. For example, the former Eastern Sichuan Supervisory Committee said that a cadre was "messing around" and recorded a major demerit because he fell in love with a female comrade in supervisory work and asked to marry her. This was wrong (and has been corrected).

3.  In conjunction with the inspection of the implementation of the Marriage Law by cadres in various places, cadres who correctly implement the Marriage Law should be commended, and cadres who have made serious mistakes in the implementation of the Marriage Law and refuse to correct them should be given appropriate administrative sanctions. When handling such cases, we must strengthen investigation and research, seek truth from facts, conscientiously grasp the policy of adhering to education in this movement, and must not engage in sloppy or perfunctory handling, so as not to affect the development of the movement.

4.  Supervise and inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law. People's supervisory organs and their staff at all levels should, under the unified leadership of the local party and government organs, stand firmly at their supervisory work posts, pay attention to and understand the development of the movement to implement the Marriage Law at any time and place, pay attention to preventing and correcting the mood and practices of impetuosity and rash advance or passive slackness, as well as the erroneous phenomenon that the movement to implement the Marriage Law is carried out in isolation and is not closely integrated with other daily work, especially the central work, and resolutely ensure the smooth and healthy progress of the movement to implement the Marriage Law.

    各级人民监察机关要认真地监督检查贯彻婚姻法
    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会主任    谭平山
    贯彻婚姻法运动已在全国各地开展起来了。贯彻婚姻法运动是一个重大的社会改革，是要废除封建婚姻制度，树立新民主主义婚姻制度，它不仅与每个人每个家庭的幸福有关系，而且与国家建设事业的发展，与后代子孙的身心健康都有关系。中华人民共和国婚姻法颁布三年以来，各地在贯彻婚姻法的工作上虽有不少成绩，但全国大部分地区内，封建的婚姻制度，重男轻女的封建思想，及由此而产生的对婚姻法的各种错误认识依然严重地存在着。这种情况，必须加以改变。现在，农村的土地改革和城市厂矿的民主改革已经基本完成，人民群众的觉悟程度已经普遍提高，广大的青壮年男女不仅有了婚姻解放的迫切要求，而且有了打碎封建婚姻制度的斗争勇气；同时，我们国家的经济建设正在开始，这个建设任务是光荣的，也是艰巨的，需要发挥广大人民群众的政治积极性或生产积极性来保证这一任务的胜利完成，这首先要把在封建婚姻制度束缚下的广大生产力解放出来。因此，中国共产党中央和中央人民政府政务院均发布了指示，规定今年三月大张旗鼓地在全国范围内（少数民族地区和土地改革尚未完成地区除外）开展一个宣传婚姻法和检查婚姻法执行情况的运动，这是非常适时的，也是非常必要的。各级人民政府、人民团体，必须认识这一运动的政治意义，重视这一运动，遵照指示认真执行。
    但是贯彻婚姻法运动不同于其他的社会改革运动，它完全是人民内部的事情，是人民自己起来反对自己头脑中的封建思想的问题，这个问题，决不能在一次运动中求得完全解决，必须经过长期地宣传教育工作，才能逐步解决。在这个运动中也决不能采取粗暴急躁的态度和阶级斗争的办法，如果把对付敌人的办法错误地用于人民内部，必然会引起群众恐慌，造成社会混乱，影响人民团结，使运动遭受失败。因此，应当加强对贯彻婚姻法的监督检查，慎重地掌握政策，正确地进行宣传，使运动稳步前进，才能达到预期目的。
    保证婚姻法的贯彻执行是人民监察机关的重要职责之一。三年来各级人民监察机关曾检查与处理了不少的有关干部执行婚姻法的案件，一九五一年并配合有关机关检查了各地执行婚姻法的情况，对推动与贯彻婚姻法起了一定的作用。
    在这一次的贯彻婚姻法运动中，各级人民监察机关除遵照政务院的指示抽派得力干部参加贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室的工作外，并应切实做好下列工作：
    一、学习婚姻法。各级监察工作人员必须学习婚姻法和有关这次运动的指示文件，通过这些文件的学习，求得在思想上认识封建婚姻制度的害处，新民主主义婚姻制度的好处，划清新旧婚姻制度的界限，并了解这次贯彻婚姻法运动的目的、方针和政策，以及贯彻婚姻法对于发展生产、建设国家的重大意义。只有懂得了这些道理，才能正确地宣传婚姻法，正确地处理政府工作人员的婚姻案件。
    二、检查工作。这应从两方面着手：一方面应对监督检查贯彻婚姻法的工作进行检查，即检查过去对贯彻婚姻法的监督检查工作是否重视，有无成绩，并总结经验，改进工作；另方面应检查过去对有关婚姻案件的处理是否认真与正确，如果有不正确的，必须负责纠正。如前川东监察委员会曾因一个干部在监察工作中和一女同志发生爱情，要求结婚，就说他“乱搞恋爱”，记大过一次，这是不对的（已纠正）。
    三、结合各地对干部贯彻执行婚姻法情况的检查，对于正确执行婚姻法的干部予以表扬，对于在执行婚姻法中犯有严重错误而又拒不改正的干部，给予适当的行政处分。在处理这种案件时，必须加强调查研究，实事求是，切实掌握这次运动的坚持教育的方针，不能潦草从事，马虎处理，以免影响运动的开展。
    四、监督检查贯彻婚姻法的工作。各级人民监察机关及其工作人员应在当地党、政机关的统一领导下，站稳监察工作岗位，随时随地注意了解贯彻婚姻法运动的发展情况，注意防止与纠正急躁冒进或消极松劲的情绪与做法，以及贯彻婚姻法运动孤立进行，不与其他日常工作特别是中心工作密切结合的错误现象，坚决保证贯彻婚姻法运动顺利地、健康地进行。
