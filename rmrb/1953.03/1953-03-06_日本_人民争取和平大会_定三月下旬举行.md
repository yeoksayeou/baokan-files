Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 3rd: Under the initiative of the Japan Council for the Protection of Peace, Japan will convene a broadly based national People's Peace Congress in late March.

According to "Peace News," Mr. Ikuo Oyama, a well-known peace activist and chairman of the Japan Council for the Protection of Peace, convened the first preparatory meeting for the Peace Congress on January 20. The meeting determined the name of the congress to be the "People's Congress for Peace," and the meeting dates were set for March 21st and 22nd. In order to broaden the foundation of the peace movement, the preparatory meeting decided to invite appropriate figures to serve as initiators of the congress, so that all people with differing opinions, as long as they demand peace, can participate in the "People's Congress for Peace," freely discuss their different opinions, and find a common path to peace. After this congress is held, the Japan Council for the Protection of Peace will then convene a meeting of the council's members and activists to discuss the policies and tasks of the Japan Council for the Protection of Peace.

The topics to be discussed at the "People's Congress for Peace" include: the Korean armistice issue, the issue of Japan sending troops to Korea, issues concerning atomic bombs and germ warfare, issues related to the Pacific military alliance, amending the Japanese Constitution, arms production, war and the economy, military bases, militaristic education and culture, and the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union and China.

In order to ensure that the opinions of all strata of society can be fully reflected at the congress, the Japan Council for the Protection of Peace calls on the peace councils in each prefecture and region to hold broadly representative gatherings at the prefectural and regional levels before the congress convenes, to freely and fully exchange opinions on peace issues.
