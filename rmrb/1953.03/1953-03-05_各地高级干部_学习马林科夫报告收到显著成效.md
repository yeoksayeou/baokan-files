    Significant Achievements in Studying Malenkov's Report by Senior Cadres in Various Regions

    Cadres across the country have made great progress in studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. According to statistics from the three Party committees directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the directly affiliated organs of the Central People's Government, and the directly affiliated organs of the Central Military Commission, as well as the Party committees of over thirty provinces (municipalities), most regions have completed the study of Comrade Malenkov's report and have submitted the summaries or reports of senior cadres' study to the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. These over thirty provincial (municipal) Party committees include the four central bureaus of Northeast, Northwest, East China, and Southwest; the three sub-bureaus of Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan, South China, and Shandong; the sixteen provincial committees of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Rehe, Hebei, Shanxi, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Guangxi, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian; and the seven municipal committees of Tianjin, Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi, Xi'an, Shanghai, and Wuhan. Currently, most areas, except for a few, have concluded the study. The scale of this study is unprecedented. According to the statistics of the three departments directly under the Central Committee alone, more than 47,150 cadres participated in the study (5,531 from the central organs, over 40,000 from the government, and 1,619 from the military organs), of which approximately 3,290 were senior cadres. These two months of theoretical study have achieved the following significant results.

    First, the theoretical study of senior cadres has been organized. Cadres have shown great enthusiasm in the study. Under the leadership of senior cadres, especially leading comrades, they generally adhere to the study system (senior groups adhere to the collective study system of two and a half days every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon). Most units ensure that there is no office work, meetings, phone calls, or visitors during study time; those who request leave due to special circumstances can make up the study on their own. The number of senior cadres participating in the study and the length of their adherence are rare in the past. Many senior cadres have further recognized the importance of theoretical study, and some senior cadres reflected that "if the water doesn't rise, the ship doesn't float high; if the leader doesn't stand firm," and feel that they must study hard.

    Through the study of the first part of Malenkov's report, the understanding of the current international situation has been generally strengthened, and some vague and incorrect views have been corrected. In particular, this study has revealed that the contradictions between imperialists are very sharp and will become increasingly intense; Lenin's argument that imperialist war is inevitable is not outdated. Everyone has a clear understanding and experience of the two parallel markets and the nature of the peace movement. This has broadened horizons, inspired fighting spirit, further understood the great significance of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and strengthened confidence in the struggle for lasting world peace. Many comrades reviewed that in the past, they did not analyze the basic characteristics and development trends of the international situation from a theoretical perspective, but only stayed on the observation of certain superficial phenomena, resulting in one-sidedness in understanding and deviations and shortcomings in work. Some comrades from the Northeast Daily reviewed that they did not have sufficient understanding of the contradictions between imperialists and the significance of the peace movement in the past. Therefore, the newspaper was insufficient in exposing the contradictions between imperialists and promoting the development of the peace movement. This study not only improved understanding but also improved newspaper work.

    The study of the second part of Malenkov's report has been better learned by cadres in economic, financial, and trade departments, and they can conduct discussions in connection with actual business, which has played a significant role in improving work. After studying this part, cadres have generally enhanced their specific understanding of the great socialist construction of the Soviet Union and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, further recognized the superiority of the socialist system, and thus enhanced their understanding and confidence in China's great construction and socialist future. Cadres (especially senior cadres) in central and local finance, economics, industry, mining, and commerce departments mostly focused on the second part of Malenkov's report, studying the advanced experience of Soviet economic construction, and examining their own work, and proposing improvement methods. For example, the State Planning Commission discussed the national construction policy, the development speed of the national economy, proportional relations, and the existing problems in current capital construction and production. It was unanimously agreed that national construction must grasp the main links, oppose decentralism, oppose the idea of "everything being revived," blind construction, and departmentalism, and oppose local views that do not proceed from the overall situation. In production, the potential of enterprises must be fully utilized, and conservatism must be opposed. Senior cadres of the Ministry of Finance examined the wrong measures in violation of economic laws in their work. Many cadres in the industrial departments of Northeast and North China criticized the past idea of being satisfied with the new records of individual workshops and individual groups while ignoring balanced production; criticized the past one-sided understanding of simply increasing labor intensity to improve labor productivity, and established a comprehensive view of improving labor productivity from all aspects, such as improving technology, improving production management and labor organization, and fully utilizing the utilization rate of machinery and equipment; criticized the practice of having only indicators in production plans and lacking specific measures, and established the idea that "national plans are active laws," and adopted effective measures from all aspects to ensure the completion of planned targets. Another example is that cadres from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives combined the study of the Soviet economic accounting system experience and proposed methods for improving the national cooperative financial accounting system. In other departments, economic work has been universally valued after study. For example, the distribution of work focus and strength of the party and mass departments in Shanghai has also been newly arranged according to the needs of industrial construction. The Shandong Provincial Department of Education established the basic view that cultural and educational undertakings should serve industry. The Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China studied the economic development of agriculture and animal husbandry in the region and how to cooperate with the national industrialization policy.

    In the third part of Malenkov's report, the Soviet Communist Party's emphasis on ideological work, its emphasis on criticism and self-criticism, especially the emphasis on bottom-up criticism, and the ruthless exposure of errors and shortcomings gave the cadres participating in the study a very profound inspiration. Many units promoted democracy, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and in particular, made a strong exposure of bureaucracy. For example, the Ministry of Water Resources revealed that out of the hundreds of people who used to write to the Ministry of Water Resources frequently, only two people are left. A mass wrote a letter from Henan, suggesting building a reservoir in Mangshan, but the General Office criticized him in the reply that "there is no scientific basis" and "there is no mountain there at all." Later, after reconnaissance, the reservoir we planned to build in Mangshan was exactly where the letter suggested. The Ministry of Water Resources also exposed the subjectivist and massive plan of the Hydrology Bureau to establish 20,000 rain gauge stations across the country. In addition, units such as the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Construction Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Justice, and the Supreme People's Court have launched bottom-up criticism. Many leading comrades combined study and the opinions put forward by everyone and made review reports. When studying the third part of Malenkov's report, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also conducted a more detailed study and review in combination with its own work. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee focused on examining the leadership and working methods of the Hebei Party, and criticized the suddenness, locality, dispersion, and rural views in the working methods cultivated in the long-term dispersed rural areas. Many places criticized the view of emphasizing qualifications in cadre work.

    These gains in learning are inseparable from the leadership's attention, help, supervision, and inspection. The instructions and circulars of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on theoretical study, and the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China and the General Party Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China successively organized six study reports, which strongly promoted the development of this theoretical study. The Northeast Bureau organized five study reports, and other places also organized mobilization reports and study reports. Responsible comrades of some units and some comrades in the senior group also served as study tutors for general cadres, which also greatly helped everyone's study. The vast majority of units have formulated practical study discipline and inspection systems. The General Party Committee directly under the Military Commission has done a better job in this regard. They proposed implementing a system of grasping tightly at each level and inspecting and supervising at each level, that is, the General Political Department and the General Party Committee directly under the Military Commission should grasp the study of each central group, the leaders of each central group should lead the study of each ordinary group, and people should be sent to inspect in time, report once a week, and publish a study bulletin, which has great results in publicizing both those who study well and those who do not abide by the system. Experience has shown that even senior cadres still need inspection and supervision on the basis of conscious study.

    In this period of study, there are still shortcomings: some units have not yet read the documents carefully, have not yet understood the spirit of the documents, and prematurely and hastily emphasized connecting with reality, held forums to talk about work casually, and turned study discussions into work talks; or completely abandoned the documents to carry out ideological struggle. For example, the study group of the Bank of Communications completely abandoned the study of the documents and held a six-day ideological struggle meeting for one cadre (which was corrected after inspection by the Ministry of Finance). In terms of adhering to the study system, there are lax phenomena in a few units and a few cadres.

    Currently, most of the central and local senior cadres are studying Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and some are studying Stalin's works on linguistics.

    各地高级干部
    学习马林科夫报告收到显著成效
    全国各地干部学习联共第十九次代表大会文件，已获得很大成绩。据中共中央直属机关、中央人民政府直属机关及中央军委直属机关等三个党委，以及三十个省（市）以上党委的统计，大部分地区已学完了马林科夫同志的报告，并已把高级干部的学习总结或学习报告送交中共中央宣传部。这三十个省（市）以上党委是东北、西北、华东、西南等四个中央局，蒙绥、华南、山东等三个分局，辽东、辽西、吉林、黑龙江、松江、热河、河北、山西、青海、甘肃、宁夏、广西、云南、江西、浙江、福建等十六个省委，天津、沈阳、抚顺、本溪、西安、上海、武汉等七个市委。目前除少数地区外，多已先后结束。这次学习的规模是空前的，仅据中央直属三个党委系统的统计，参加学习的干部共四万七千一百五十余人（中直五千五百三十一人，政府四万余人，军直一千六百一十九人），其中高级干部约三千二百九十余人。这两个多月的理论学习，已收到以下一些显著的成效。
    首先，高级干部的理论学习已经组织起来。干部在学习中的热情很高，在高级干部，特别是在主要负责同志带头下，一般都能坚持学习制度（高级组坚持了每周星期三、六下午两个半日的集体学习制度）。大多数单位做到了学习时间不办公、不开会、不打电话、不会客；因特殊事故请假者，能做到自动补学。高级干部参加学习人数之多，坚持之久，是以前所少见的。许多高级干部已进一步认识了理论学习的重要性，某些高级干部反映：“水涨船不高，领导站不稳”、“过去懂得的太少”，感觉非好好学习不行了。
    通过马林科夫报告第一部分的学习，普遍地加强了对目前国际形势的认识，纠正了一些模糊及错误的观点，特别是从这一学习中，认识到帝国主义间的矛盾是十分尖锐的，并将日益剧烈；列宁关于帝国主义战争不可避免的论点并不是过时的论点。大家对两个平行市场以及和平运动的性质都有了明确的了解与体会。这就扩大了眼界，鼓舞了斗志，对抗美援朝运动的伟大意义有了进一步的了解，对争取世界持久和平的斗争增强了信心。许多同志检讨过去没有从理论上去分析国际形势的基本特点和发展趋势，而只是停留在某些表面现象的观察上，因而认识上有片面性，在工作上也发生偏差和缺点。东北日报有些同志检讨过去对帝国主义之间的矛盾以及和平运动的意义没有足够认识，因此，报纸在揭露帝国主义之间的矛盾方面和宣传和平运动的发展方面都很不够。这次学习不但提高了认识，而且改进了报纸工作。
    对于马林科夫报告的第二部分的学习，以财经贸易部门干部学得较好，并能联系实际业务进行讨论，对改进工作起了很大作用。学习这一部分以后，干部普遍增强了对苏联伟大社会主义建设事业和人民生活福利不断上升的具体认识，进一步地认识了社会主义制度的优越性，因而也增强了对我国伟大建设事业和社会主义前途的认识与信心。中央和各地财经、工矿商业部门的干部（特别是高级干部）多以马林科夫报告第二部分为重点，学习苏联经济建设的先进经验，并检查了自己的工作，提出了改进的办法。如国家计划委员会讨论了国家建设的方针、国民经济的发展速度、比例关系及当前基本建设和生产中存在的问题，一致认为国家建设必须抓住主要环节，反对分散主义思想，反对“百废俱兴”、盲目建设的思想和本位主义，反对不从全局出发的局部观点。在生产上必须充分发挥企业潜在力，反对保守主义思想。财政部的高级干部检查了工作中违反经济法则的错误措施。东北和华北工业部门的许多干部在学习中批判了过去满足于个别车间与个别小组的新纪录而忽视均衡生产的思想；批判了过去单纯从提高劳动强度去提高劳动生产率的片面认识，树立了从提高技术、改进生产管理与劳动组织、充分发挥机器设备运用率等各方面去提高劳动生产率的全面观点；批判了在生产计划中只有指标，缺乏具体措施的作法，树立了“国家计划就是积极的法律”，从各方面采取有效措施保证完成计划指标的思想。又如中华全国合作总社机关干部结合学习了苏联经济核算制的经验，提出了改进全国合作社财务会计制度的办法。在其他的各部门，经过学习都普遍地重视经济工作。例如上海党群部门工作重点与力量的分配也随着工业建设的需要有了新的布置。山东省教育厅树立了文化教育事业应为工业服务的基本观点。中共中央蒙绥分局研究了本地区农牧业经济发展状况，以及如何配合国家工业化的方针。
    在马林科夫报告第三部分中，苏联共产党对思想工作的重视，对批评与自我批评的重视，尤其是强调自下而上的批评，无情地揭发错误与缺点，给予参加学习的干部以极深刻的启示。许多单位发扬了民主，开展了批评与自我批评，特别是对官僚主义作了有力的揭发。如水利部揭发出以往几百个与水利部常来信的群众，现在只剩下两个人。河南一位群众来信，建议在邙山建造水库，但办公厅在回信中却批评他“没有科学根据”，“那里根本无山”。后来经勘察的结果，我们计划在邙山建造的水库恰是那封来信所建议的地方。水利部还揭发出了水文局的全国建立两万个雨量站的主观主义的庞大计划。此外如商业部、内务部、对外贸易部、中华全国合作总社、轻工业部、重工业部的建设工业局、司法部和最高人民法院等单位都展开了自下而上的批评。不少的领导同志结合学习与大家提出的意见作了检讨性的报告。中共中央组织部在学马林科夫报告第三部分时结合本身业务，也作了较细致的研究与检讨。河北省委着重检查了河北党的领导和工作方法，批判了长期处在分散的农村所养成的工作方法上的突击性、地方性、分散性与农村观点等。许多地方批评在干部工作上的着重资格的观点。
    这一些学习上的收获，是和领导方面的重视和帮助、督促和检查分不开的。中共中央关于理论学习的指示与通报，中共中央宣传部与中共中央总党委先后组织了六次学习报告，有力地推动了这一次理论学习的展开。东北局组织了五次学习报告，其他各地也都组织了动员报告与学习报告。有些单位的负责同志和高级组一部分同志还担任了一般干部学习辅导员，这对大家的学习也帮助很大。绝大部分的单位都制订了切实可行的学习纪律与检查制度。这一方面军委直属总党委作得较好。他们提出实行按级抓紧、按级检查督促的制度，即由总政及军直总党委抓紧各中心组学习，由各中心组领导各普通组学习，并及时派人检查，每周汇报一次，出版学习简报，把学习好的和不遵守制度的都登在简报上，收效很大。经验证明，即使是高级干部，在自觉学习的基础上，仍然需要检查与督促。
    这一段学习中，仍存在着缺点：有的单位还未好好阅读文件，对文件的精神还没有了解，就过早过急地强调联系实际，召开座谈会漫谈工作，把学习讨论会变为工作漫谈会；或者完全丢开文件，去作思想斗争。例如交通银行学习小组，完全把文件的学习丢开，对一个干部开了六天的思想斗争会（经财政部检查后纠正了）。在坚持学习制度方面，有少数单位与少数干部存在松懈现象。
    现在中央和各地的高级干部大部正学习斯大林同志“苏联社会主义经济问题”，一部分学习斯大林论语言学的著作。
