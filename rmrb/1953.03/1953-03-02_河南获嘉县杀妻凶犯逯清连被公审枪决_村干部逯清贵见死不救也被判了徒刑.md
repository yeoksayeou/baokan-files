In June of last year, a tragic case occurred in Shizhuang Village, Second District, Huojia County, Henan Province (formerly part of Pingyuan Province), where a woman, Chen Yunlan, was murdered by her husband. The murderer, Lu Qinglian, has been publicly tried and executed by firing squad. Party members and cadres who made mistakes in this case have been punished by Party discipline and state law.

Chen Yunlan, 31 years old, was from Sanweiying Village, Second District, Huojia County. In July 1951, she was forced into marriage with Lu Qinglian of Shizhuang Village by her mother and elder sister. Lu Qinglian was 34 years old, had served in the puppet and Kuomintang armies for many years, and had murdered five of our revolutionary cadres and masses. After liberation, he was placed under surveillance. In the autumn of 1951, Lu Qinggui (Lu Qinglian's younger brother), the Party Branch Secretary of the CCP Shizhuang Village, without mobilizing the masses for discussion or obtaining government approval, arbitrarily lifted Lu Qinglian's surveillance.

After being forced to marry Lu Qinglian, Chen Yunlan devoted herself to labor and took care of her more than 80-year-old mother-in-law, but she still frequently suffered abuse from her husband. Unable to endure this, Chen Yunlan filed for divorce with the village government in September 1951.

Lu Qinggui, the Party Branch Secretary of Shizhuang Village (who lived in the same courtyard as Lu Qinglian), under the influence of feudal ideology, did not correct Lu Qinglian's abuse of his wife, nor did he agree to Chen Yunlan's legitimate request for divorce. The village head, Shi Yushu, and other village cadres, under Lu Qinggui's influence, also repeatedly used so-called "mediation" methods to delay the matter. Chen Yunlan requested a divorce from the village government more than ten times, but none of them were processed. In March 1952, Chen Yunlan applied for divorce to the district people's government, but Li Hongji, the district cultural instructor who handled the matter, did not deal with it responsibly. Chen Yunlan cried and insisted on a divorce, but was forcibly taken away by Lu Qinggui.

On the morning of June 6th, Chen Yunlan again took her child to the village head, Shi Yushu, to request a divorce. Lu Qinglian followed her closely, forcing her to go home. Chen Yunlan was afraid of being beaten after returning home and refused to go back. Lu Qinglian snatched the child, took it home, and closed the door. The child cried loudly. The village head Shi Yushu, village mediation committee member Shi Shangxi, militia minister Shi Shangfa, and village people's representative conference chairman Yue Chengfu, fearing that Lu Qinglian would harm the child, went together to knock on the door. Lu Qinglian did not open it, and Lu Qinggui stood by without saying a word. Shi Yushu then told Shi Shangfa to ask the district for instructions: whether they could break open the doors and windows to rescue the child. After waiting for a while, the door still couldn't be opened, and Shi Yushu asked Yue Chengfu to go to the district for instructions. At this time, Chen Yunlan returned home and went to the north room to take care of her mother-in-law. The others were waiting in the west room for instructions from the district. Lu Qinglian heard that Chen Yunlan had returned and ran into the north room, closing the door at once. Shi Yushu, fearing that someone might die, quickly went to push the door. He couldn't open it. Shi Yushu then said to Lu Qinggui: "This is your home, and you are the branch secretary. What do you say? Just one word is enough (meaning to ask Lu Qinggui to agree to break open the doors and windows to go in and rescue her)." Lu Qinggui replied: "Go to the district for instructions!" Lu Qinggui and Shi Shangxi squatted under the window and heard Chen Yunlan begging Lu Qinglian for mercy and calling for help to the people outside: "Quick, open the door, something terrible is happening, he is killing me with a knife!" Lu Qinggui remained silent. Shi Shangxi, seeing the urgency of the situation and that Lu Qinggui was not doing anything, got up and ran to the district government.

After Shi Shangfa, who went to the district for instructions first, arrived at the district, he found the deputy district chief, An Xilong. An Xilong did not respond after hearing the report. Shi Shangfa then found the district party secretary, Shang Fengtian. Shang Fengtian's reply was: "This is an administrative matter, ask the district chief to handle it for you." Shi Shangfa then found An Xilong. An's reply was: "Don't break the windows when you go back, just call the door open." On the way back to the village, Shi Shangfa met Yue Chengfu who was coming to the district for instructions. Yue Chengfu said, "If we can't call the door open, how can we not break the windows!" So the two of them went back to Shang Fengtian, and Shang Fengtian allowed them to break open the windows. On the way back to the village, they met the village head Shi Yushu. Shi Yushu said that Lu Qinglian and Chen Yunlan were in the same room and something was about to happen, and it would only be resolved if someone from the district went. So the three of them went back to Shang Fengtian. But Shang Fengtian wanted to go to other places and wanted Deputy District Chief An Xilong to go. An Xilong said, "I'm not familiar with that place." He asked Shang Fengtian to go. Finally, Shang Fengtian agreed, but he had to ride his bicycle (the district government was only a kilometer away from Shizhuang), and the bicycle was flat. Shang Fengtian asked Shi Shangfa to wait and go back first, and he and the village head Shi Yushu would pump up the tires before going. Just as they finished pumping, Shi Shangxi ran over and shouted: "He's going to chop her (murder) in the room! Hurry up and go!" Shang Fengtian asked: "Has he chopped her yet?" Shi Shangxi said: "Not yet." Shang Fengtian said: "I don't think he dares." Finally, under the urging of the Shizhuang village cadres, Shang Fengtian set off.

After Shi Shangxi left, Chen Yunlan hugged Lu Qinggui's child in the room (she brought it in when she went to the north room, for fear of being beaten) and refused to let go. Lu Qinglian forced her to put down the child. Lu Qinggui, hearing this situation outside, finally said to the room: "No matter what you do, get my child out, don't scare my child." Lu Qinglian snatched the child and passed it out from under the "door sill." Chen Yunlan took the opportunity when Lu Qinglian handed over the child to try to grab the knife. While the two were fighting for the knife, Lu Qinggui went to the cooperative, pretending not to know about it. Lu Qinggui's wife also took the child and left. Chen Yunlan finally couldn't overpower Lu Qinglian and was hacked to the ground. The criminal Lu aimed at Chen Yunlan and hacked her more than thirty times, and then cut her throat with a sickle. The militia rushed to the scene and tied up Lu Qinglian and sent him to the district. On the way to the street, they met the district party secretary Shang Fengtian, the deputy district chief An Xilong, and the village cadres who had gone to ask for instructions. Shang Fengtian saw that the murderer had been arrested and left without even looking at the situation of the deceased.

After the incident, the Huojia County leading organs immediately formed an inspection team to investigate and clarify the case. On August 18th, the criminal Lu Qinglian was sentenced to death at a public trial and executed by firing squad on the spot. The public trial also announced the handling decisions for the cadres who had violated the law and neglected their duties (approved by the CCP Xinxiang Prefectural Committee and the Xinxiang Commissioner's Office): Lu Qinggui was expelled from the Party and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment; Shang Fengtian, the secretary of the Second District Party Committee, received a warning; Deputy District Chief An Xilong received a demerit; and other derelict cadres were given criticism and education and ordered to make profound self-criticisms.

    河南获嘉县杀妻凶犯逯清连被公审枪决
    村干部逯清贵见死不救也被判了徒刑
    河南省获嘉县（原属平原省）第二区师庄村，去年六月间发生妇女陈运兰被丈夫杀死的惨案。杀人凶犯逯清连已被公审枪毙，在这一案件中犯有错误的党员和干部已分别受到党纪国法的制裁。
    陈运兰，三十一岁，获嘉县第二区三位营村人。一九五一年七月由母亲和姐姐包办，同师庄村逯清连结婚。逯清连三十四岁，当过伪、顽军多年，曾杀害我革命干部、群众五人，解放后被管制。一九五一年秋，中共师庄村支部书记逯清贵（逯清连的弟弟），未发动群众讨论、更未经政府批准，便擅自解除了逯清连的管制。
    陈运兰被迫与逯清连结婚后，全力劳动，并照顾八十多岁的老婆婆，仍然时常遭受丈夫虐待。陈运兰无法忍受，乃于一九五一年九月向村政府提出离婚要求。
    师庄村党支部书记逮清贵（和逯清连住同院）在封建思想支配下，对逯清连虐待妻子的行为不加纠正，也不同意陈运兰的正当离婚要求。村长师玉书和其他村干部，在逯清贵的影响下，也一味用所谓
    “和解”办法来拖延。陈运兰向村政府要求离婚十余次，都未得到处理。一九五二年三月，陈运兰到区人民政府申请离婚，受理此事的区文化教员李洪吉也未做负责的处理。陈运兰哭诉着坚决要求离婚，但终被逯清贵强行叫走。
    六月六日早晨，陈运兰又抱着孩子找到村长师玉书要求离婚。逯清连紧跟了她来，逼着她回家。陈运兰害怕回家后要挨打，不肯回去。逯清连就把孩子夺过去，带回家里，关上屋门，孩子当时大声嚎哭。村长师玉书和村调解委员师尚喜、武装部长师尚法，村人民代表会主席岳成福等怕逯清连要害孩子，
    一齐前往叫门。逯清连不开，逯清贵就在一旁，也不作声。师玉书则叫师尚法到区请示：能不能捣开门窗解救孩子。等了一会，门还是叫不开，师玉书又叫岳成福去区请示。这时陈运兰回到家来，到北屋去照顾老婆婆。其他人都在西屋等候区的指示。逯清连听见陈运兰回来了，就跑进北屋，一下把门关上。师玉书恐怕闹出人命，就赶快去推门。推不开。师玉书便向逯清贵说：“这是你的家，你又是支部书记，你说怎么办？一句话就行（意思是叫逯清贵允请打破门窗进去解救）。”逯清贵却回答：“你上区请示吧！”师玉书便亲自到区请示。逯清贵和师尚喜蹲在窗子底下，听见陈运兰一面向逯清连求饶，一面向外面的人呼救：“快把门弄开吧，了不得啦，他拿刀杀我哩！”逯清贵仍不作声。师尚喜一看事情紧急，逯清贵又不管，便起身往区政府跑去。
    第一个去区请示的师尚法到区后，找到副区长安喜龙。安喜龙听了报告，没作答复。师尚法又找到区委书记尚风田。尚风田的答复是：“这是行政上的事，找区长给你办办就行了。”师尚法又找到安喜龙。安的答复是：“回去别捣窗户，把门叫开就行了。”师尚法回村的路上，碰见岳成福来区请示。岳成福说：“叫不开门，不捣窗户怎么能行呢！”于是两人又回去找尚风田，尚风田才允许把窗户捣开。他两人回村的路上，又碰见村长师玉书。师玉书说，逯清连、陈运兰两人已经到了一个屋子里，眼看要出乱子，要区里去人才能解决。于是三人又回去找尚风田。可是尚风田要到其他地方去，想叫副区长安喜龙去。安喜龙说：“我在那里不熟。”他叫尚风田去。最后尚风田答应了， 可是还要骑车子去（区政府离师庄只一里路），而车子又没气。尚风田让师尚法等先回去，他和村长师玉书把车子打好气再去。刚打好气，师尚喜跑来喊道：“屋里要劈（杀人）哩！您赶快去吧！”尚风田问：“劈翻了没有？”师尚喜说：“还没有。”尚风田说：“量他也不敢。”最后在师庄村干部的催促下，尚风田才动身。
    在师尚喜走后，陈运兰在屋里抱着逯清贵的孩子（是她进北屋时，为了怕挨打抱进去的）死不放手。逯清连逼她放下孩子。逯清贵在外边听到这种情形，才开口对屋里说：“不管你们闹个啥样，把我的孩子给弄出来，别吓坏了我的孩子。”逯清连夺过孩子，从“门坎”底下递了出去。陈运兰趁着逯清连递孩子的时候，曾去夺刀。两人在夺刀的时候，逯清贵却走到合作社，装不知道这回事。逯清贵的妻子也抱着孩子走出去。陈运兰终于夺不过逯清连，被砍倒在地。逯犯对准陈运兰连砍三十余刀，又用镰刀割断了她的咽喉。民兵闻讯赶来，把逯清连捆绑送区，走到大街上，才碰见区委书记尚风田、副区长安喜龙和前往请示的几个村干部回来。尚风田见凶犯已被逮捕，也没看死者的情况就走了。
    事件发生后，获嘉县领导机关立即组成检查组前往检查，弄清了案情。八月十八日，逯犯清连在公审大会上被判处死刑，当场执行枪决。公审大会并宣布了对违法失职干部的处理决定（经中共新乡地委和新乡专署分别批准）：开除逯清贵的党籍，判处有期徒刑八年；第二区区委书记尚风田受警告处分；副区长安喜龙记过一次；其他失职干部，分别给予批评教育，并令其深刻检讨。
