National Match Production Exceeds Actual Needs
Match Industries in Various Regions Should Strictly Arrange Production According to National Production Control Figures; Commercial Systems Should Vigorously Expand Match Sales

　　The national match industry experienced a production-sales imbalance in 1952, which must be overcome in 1953. According to estimates from the Central Ministry of Light Industry, the national match output in 1952 could reach 111% of the highest annual output in history. Due to the occurrence of production exceeding sales in some regions during the first half of 1952, it was necessary to temporarily reduce production. Although the actual output last year only reached about 90% of the planned target, according to material statistics from various regions at the end of 1952, the country still had over 2 million cases of matches in stock, exceeding the normal reserve by more than double.
　　The National Match Industry Conference in June 1950 decided on the principle of "determining production based on sales." The First National Light Industry Conference in August 1951 also formulated a production and sales plan for the match industry in 1952 that was relatively in line with reality. However, because the Central Ministry of Light Industry did not accurately grasp the basic situation of national match production and sales at that time, nor did it establish close contact with the trade departments; and because the industrial and trade departments in some regions overestimated the sales volume for 1952; and because the local finance and economic committees also successively requested increased production, the Central Ministry of Light Industry formulated and allocated higher production control figures in October 1951 than originally planned. This figure was 30% higher than in 1951. This is the fundamental reason for the production-sales imbalance in 1952. Individual regions, such as the Northeast match industry authorities, further increased the production control figures stipulated by the central government by 20%, further exacerbating the severe production-sales imbalance.
　　Secondly, there were also some problems in match sales. In 1952, all or most of the matches in major production areas across the country were exclusively sold by department stores. Some department stores in some regions, after purchasing matches, did not actively allocate and promote sales, resulting in some regions experiencing sluggish sales while other regions experienced buyers queuing up to purchase matches. Some department stores in some regions, after purchasing matches, accumulated large quantities in warehouses. The industrial departments were misled by this phenomenon, believing that "production and sales were balanced," and failed to accurately understand the actual sales situation, blindly increasing production, thus causing production to exceed sales.
　　In addition, the existence of shoddy workmanship in the match industry in individual regions is also a reason for the accumulation of products.
　　In order to strengthen the planned nature of the match industry's production and sales, and to correct the production-sales imbalance, the Central Ministry of Light Industry has currently decided that the main production policy for the national match industry is to improve quality and reduce costs, and will appropriately reduce the production control figures for 1953. Match industries in various regions should strictly arrange production according to national production control figures, and should not blindly establish new factories or add production equipment.
　　Trade departments should simultaneously improve purchasing, allocation, and sales work, and lead cooperatives and private merchants to organize extensive sales networks, penetrate into rural areas, and expand sales. Special attention should be paid to expanding sales in rural and remote areas where transportation was previously inconvenient.

    全国火柴生产量超过实际需要
    各地火柴工业应严格依据国家生产控制数字布置生产，商业系统应大力打开火柴销路
    一九五二年全国火柴工业存在着产销不平衡的现象。必须在一九五三年予以克服。据中央轻工业部估计，一九五二年全国火柴产量可达到历史上最高年产量的百分之一百一十一。由于一九五二年上半年部分地区发生了产多于销的现象，因此不得不临时减少产量。去年实际产量虽只完成计划的百分之九十左右，但根据一九五二年底各地材料统计，全国火柴还积存了二百余万件，超过正常储备量一倍以上。
    一九五○年六月全国火柴工业会议决定了“以销定产”的方针，一九五一年八月首届全国轻工业会议制订的一九五二年火柴工业产销计划也比较切合实际。但由于中央轻工业部当时没有正确掌握全国火柴工业产销的基本情况，也没有同贸易部门取得密切联系；部分地区工业和贸易部门又过高地估计了一九五二年的销路；各地财政经济委员会也纷纷要求增产，因此，中央轻工业部在一九五一年十月间制订并分配了较原计划为高的生产控制数字，这个数字较一九五一年增加了百分之三十。这是造成一九五二年产销不平衡的基本原因。个别地区，如东北火柴工业主管部门，又在中央规定的控制数字上增加了百分之二十，更增加了产销不平衡的严重情况。
    其次，在火柴销售上也存在着一些问题。一九五二年全国各主要产区的火柴，全部或大部由百货公司包销。有些地区的百货公司在收购火柴后，没有主动地调拨和推销，因此发生了部分地区火柴滞销，而有些地区发生买主要排队购买火柴的现象。有些地区百货公司收购火柴后，就大量地积压在仓库里，工业部门被这种现象所迷惑，认为已经“产销平衡”，不再正确地了解实际销售情况，盲目增加产量，因此造成产多于销的现象。
    此外，个别地区火柴工业还存在着粗制滥造的现象，也是造成产品积压的一个原因。
    为了加强火柴工业产销计划性，纠正产销不平衡现象，目前中央轻工业部已决定全国火柴工业生产方针主要是提高质量、降低成本，并将一九五三年生产控制数字适当减低。各地火柴工业应严格依据国家生产控制数字布置生产，不应盲目建立新厂及添置生产设备。
    贸易部门应同时改进收购、调拨和推销工作，领导合作社和私商组织广泛的销售网，深入农村，打开销路。特别应注意打开过去交通不便的农村和偏僻地区的销路。
