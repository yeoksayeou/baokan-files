Following the publication of reports on the flawed designs of the Northeast No. 1 Ceramics Factory and Tongguanshan in Anhui, the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government recently convened a symposium during its design conference, gathering principal engineering and technical personnel from various design units to exchange experiences and lessons learned in design work.

The symposium began with a discussion of the flawed designs of the Northeast No. 1 Ceramics Factory. Combining this with the design work experiences of various units, it focused on exposing shortcomings in the ideological work styles of design personnel and centrally criticized individualism and subjectivism among designers.

Liu Shizan, head of the Design Department of the Northeast Machinery Bureau, cited numerous specific facts to illustrate the necessity of correcting the ideological work styles of design personnel. For example, the department once designed a school. The design personnel, afraid of the cold and unwilling to walk more, proceeded with the design without proper surveying. It was later discovered that the school site was located in an area prone to summer flooding, rendering the design unusable and delaying the school's construction. Another example involved a technician who, in pursuit of novelty and aesthetic appeal in the design of a roof, adopted a reinforced concrete structure. As a result, it could not be installed after construction, requiring repeated modifications, estimated to waste ten billion yuan, and it was still not very stable. This technician still refused to admit his mistake. Liu Shizan said that "pretending to understand when one doesn't" is also prevalent among technical personnel. This is a very harmful and dishonest mentality. For example, someone asked an engineer how large a coal stove door should be. The matter was simple; if he didn't know, he could simply say so, or look it up in a book. But this engineer did not do that. Someone suggested one size, and he agreed; then someone suggested another size, and he agreed as well. What was the actual size? He himself didn't know. Why did he do this? It was all a matter of "saving face." Irresponsibility during design reviews was also a serious issue, with one engineer even signing off on over twenty drawings in a matter of minutes.

Luo Shiyu, an engineer at the Beijing Design Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building, reflected on his own shortcomings. He said that when designing for the Tianjin United Machinery Factory, the site was close and transportation was convenient, but he did not visit the site. Later, he learned that the factory site had many small ponds, but he still didn't go. When designing for another factory, he heard the factory say "We use over 60,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, requiring high-voltage power supply and three transformer rooms." He expressed doubt about the electricity consumption and sent someone to measure it. However, the person who went reported that it was necessary, and he believed it. As a result, the written report was never reviewed and remained in the drawer. In reality, only over 30,000 kilowatt-hours were needed. Now, there is not only a waste of transformer equipment, but it also affects the overall layout. At the meeting, Wang Yujin, an engineer from the Automobile Industry Bureau's Design Office, also gave examples to illustrate the harm of designers not conducting investigations and research. For example, when designing a certain factory, no on-site investigation was conducted beforehand. It was later discovered that the factory area was behind a school, and the road in front of the factory had to bypass the school. The designers considered this undignified and decided to open another road from the northwest corner of the factory and determined the test area to be fifteen kilometers. However, they still did not conduct an investigation, only looked at a suburban plan and started designing. Later, they found that this road had to pass under a railway bridge, which trucks could not pass through; and because of a small mountain obstruction, only three kilometers could be used as a test area.

Zhi Bingyuan, Deputy Director of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant Preparatory Office, also spoke at the meeting. He first criticized some designers for emphasizing objective reasons and not examining their own thinking. He said: "There are many problems with the design workers themselves. In particular, the ideas of individualism and subjectivism are very serious." For example, in the design of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, the technical personnel subjectively believed that the Fen River water could be used. Seeing an old water tower on the west bank, they decided to locate the factory on the west bank of the river. As a result, two wells were dug without finding water, and the Fen River's water volume varied greatly, with water shortages in winter and a lot of silt in the water at other times, making it unusable. Later, they happened to find a natural water source, which solved the problem. In the design of the forging factory, without studying how much the steam hammer's vibration force was, nor whether the vibration force would affect other factory buildings, it was blindly moved to a far away place. In fact, this was unnecessary, and later revised with the help of Soviet experts. At the same time, the design personnel of various departments did not have enough contact, with each person only needing to do his own job well, regardless of others. Therefore, some sewers, heating pipes, machine equipment foundations and factory building foundations clashed. In addition, some designers, starting from personal considerations, used more materials in order to ensure the safety of their designs, wasting state resources.

Finally, Li Muyu, Deputy Director of the Design Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building, spoke. He hoped that everyone would bring the spirit of criticism and self-criticism from the meeting to their respective units, strengthen their studies, carefully read Chairman Mao's works, earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve ideologically and technically, and do a good job in design work to serve the country's large-scale economic construction.

    吸取东北第一陶瓷厂等错误设计的教训
    第一机械工业部技术人员座谈设计经验
    本报转发东北第一陶瓷厂和安徽铜官山的错误设计以后，中央人民政府第一机械工业部最近在该部设计会议进行期间，召集各设计单位主要工程技术人员，举行了一次座谈会，交流设计工作中的经验教训。
    座谈会从东北第一陶瓷厂的错误设计谈起，结合着各单位设计工作的情况，着重地揭发了设计人员思想作风方面的缺点，并集中地批判了设计人员的个人主义与主观主义。
    东北机械局设计处处长刘史瓒列举了许多具体的事实，说明设计人员应首先端正思想作风的必要性。例如该处曾设计一个学校，设计人员怕冷，不愿多走路，没有很好地勘测就进行设计。后来发现校址正好在夏天积水的地方，做出的设计不能用，学校的建设也推迟了。又如另一个技术人员设计一个屋顶，追求形式上的新奇美观，采用了钢筋混凝土的结构。结果，施工后放不上去，一改再改，估计要浪费十亿元，并且很不牢固。这个技术人员还不承认错误。刘史瓒说，在技术人员中，“不懂装懂”的情形也很普遍。这是一种非常有害的不老实的思想。例如有人问一个工程师，煤炉的门要多大？本来事情很简单，不知道就说不知道；或者去翻书找答案。但是这个工程师不是这样。有人说这样，他说对；又有人说是那样，他也说对。到底是多少呢？他自己也不知道。为什么要这样呢？原来就是“面子问题”在作祟。在审核设计时，不负责任的现象也很严重，甚至有一个工程师在几分钟内就在二十几张图纸上签了字。
    第一机械工业部北京设计处工程师罗士瑜，检讨了自己的缺点。他说，给天津联合机器厂作设计时，路很近、交通也方便，但是没有到现场去看一下，后来知道了厂址有许多小水塘，还是没有去。他在给另外一个工厂设计时，听到厂方说“一年用电六万多度，需高压送电，要设三个变电间”，曾对用电量表示怀疑，也曾派人去量。但是，派去的人回来说有必要，就信以为真了。于是，书面报告始终没有看，一直放在抽屉里。实际上只要三万多度电就够了。现在不但变电设备有浪费，对总体布置也有影响。会上，汽车工业局设计室工程师王玉金也举例说明设计人员不调查研究对工作的危害性。例如在做某一个工厂的设计时，设计前没有去现场了解，后来发现厂区在学校后边，工厂门前的路要从学校旁边绕过去，设计人员认为不体面，于是决定从工厂西北角另开一条道路，并确定试验区为十五公里。可是，还是没有进行调查，只看了看郊区平面图就着手设计，后来发现这条路要从铁道桥梁下边经过，卡车过不去；又由于有小山阻碍，只有三里路可作试验区。
    太原重型机器厂筹备处副主任支秉渊也在会上发言。他首先对某些设计人员强调客观原因而不检查自己的思想进行了批判。他说：“设计工作人员本身的问题是很多的。特别是个人主义和主观主义的思想很严重。”如在太原重型机器厂设计中，技术人员主观地认为汾河水可以利用，并看到西岸有一个旧水塔，就决定将工厂设在河西。结果打了两个井都没有水，而且汾河水量变化很大，冬季缺水，平时水中泥沙很多，也不能用。后来碰巧找到天然水源，才算解决了问题。在锻造工厂设计中，不研究汽锤震动力有多大，也不研究震动力是否会影响别的厂房，就盲目地搬到很远的地方。实际上这是不必要的，后来经苏联专家帮助修正。同时，各部门的设计人员联系也很不够，各人只要自己作好，不管别人。因此，有些上下水道、暖气管，机器设备基础与厂房基础发生了冲突。此外，有的设计人员从个人出发，为了自己的设计保险，就多用材料，浪费国家的资财。
    最后，第一机械工业部设计司副司长李慕愚发言。他希望大家把会上的批评与自我批评精神带到各个单位中去，并加强学习，精读毛主席的著作，认真学习苏联先进经验，从思想上与技术上提高一步，做好设计工作，为祖国大规模经济建设服务。
