Wang Guiying is the female street leader of the third street in the urban area of Lushan County, Henan Province. In October of last year, she was selected as a model cadre in implementing the Marriage Law and attended the Lushan County Model Representative Conference for Implementing the Marriage Law.

Wang Guiying is forty-eight years old this year and was originally from Shandong. At the age of six, due to the Yellow River bursting its banks, she followed her parents as they fled famine and begged for food to Lushan. Soon after, her father died, and her mother had no choice but to sell her to someone as a child bride in exchange for eight strings of cash to buy a coffin for her father. Her mother-in-law disliked her for having an "ugly face and big feet" and often abused her; her uncle and husband helped to beat her. For decades, she was beaten, scolded, starved, and frozen, suffering enough hardship. She asked others: why are poor people and women so miserable? People said it was "fate." She once attempted to hang herself but was saved by a neighbor, but the thought of suicide never left her. Later, she met an old fellow villager from Shandong in Lushan who told her that "the Red Army is coming soon, the Red Army will distribute land to the poor and liberate women." From that day on, Wang Guiying saw light in the darkness. She looked forward to the "Red Army" every day.

In 1947, the "Red Army" finally came, and Lushan County was liberated. Wang Guiying saw her relatives. She helped the People's Liberation Army by boiling water, washing clothes, and reporting the situation to the PLA. Soon after, she joined the Women's Federation. Her husband said to her, "The Red Army won't last long, the Central Army will come and kill you." Wang Guiying firmly replied, "As long as I can live a few days of liberation, I'm willing to be killed!" She united the women in her street, struggled against the local bullies and landlords, and collected materials on the activities of the I-Kuan Tao sect. Later, she was elected as the director of the street's Women's Federation and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1949. Under the education of the Party, she gradually understood that the suffering of poor people and women was not due to "fate" but to an unreasonable social system. She understood how to seek liberation.

After the Marriage Law was promulgated in 1950, the Lushan County Party Committee, the County People's Government, and the County Women's Federation convened a three-day symposium for cadres from various streets to discuss the spirit of the Marriage Law and to arrange publicity tasks. After attending the symposium, Wang Guiying was so excited that she couldn't sleep. On the one hand, she had personally experienced the pain of feudal marriage and felt that the Marriage Law was too good; on the other hand, she realized in her work that the oppression and restriction of women by feudal families was the biggest obstacle to mobilizing women. Therefore, she was eager to publicize it to the masses, but she was afraid of not remembering the meaning of the Marriage Law clearly, so she asked her daughter to read it to her line by line at night.

However, Wang Guiying encountered difficulties as soon as she started publicizing it. She found that some people did not welcome the Marriage Law as much as she did. Some said that the Marriage Law encouraged divorce and broke up families; others said that the Communist Party's policies were all good, but the Marriage Law destroyed the rules that had existed since ancient times; especially the old women discussed a lot: if everyone is free, what will the world become! Wang Guiying felt distressed. However, she remembered the words of the responsible comrade of the County Party Committee: "Communists must never bow to difficulties." She also remembered the education of the director of the County Women's Federation: "Women cadres should take the lead in implementing the Marriage Law." She decided to first break through the most feudal ideological barrier and first convened a meeting of old women. At first, everyone was silent, so Wang Guiying took the lead in recounting the oppression and suffering she had suffered in the past. Everyone listened to Wang Guiying's complaints and wiped their tears with their sleeves. An old woman named Jia Qing also recounted the same suffering as Wang Guiying: being abused, beaten, and scolded, and the husband's family disliked her family for being poor and didn't allow her to contact her family for fifteen years. Jia Qing cried as she spoke, and others cried along with her. Everyone began to complain: some talked about their own experiences, and some talked about the suffering of their daughters. Wang Guiying seized this opportunity to publicize the crimes of the feudal marriage system and the benefits of the Marriage Law, and mobilized Jia Qing to complain at the mass meeting. Through complaining, it aroused the masses' hatred for the feudal marriage system, and several parents expressed on the spot that they would no longer arrange marriages for their children.

The cadres of the Third Street also discussed organizing loudspeakers, blackboards, Yangko dance teams, and theatrical troupes to publicize the Marriage Law. Although the masses were interested in Yangko dancing and watching plays, they were unwilling to participate themselves, especially the theatrical troupe was even more difficult to organize, and many people thought that acting was "shameful." Wang Guiying took the lead in dancing the Yangko and mobilized her daughter to join the theatrical troupe. Then eight or nine young men and women joined. This theatrical troupe has performed many programs promoting the Marriage Law in the past two years, which has played a role in promoting the implementation of the Marriage Law.

Through various means of publicity such as theatrical troupes, blackboards, and loudspeakers, the masses gradually gained an understanding of the Marriage Law, but they still had many concerns. Some widows were willing to remarry in their hearts, but they didn't have the courage; some women were deeply oppressed by unreasonable marriages, but they didn't dare to stand up and fight against feudal forces; young men and women were in love, and the masses still didn't like it. Wang Guiying went to the branch secretary to discuss how to further implement it. Under the leadership and help of the branch, twenty women propagandists from the street were organized into groups of four to carry out door-to-door publicity, and to investigate whether there were any phenomena of abuse and beatings, or whether there were any arranged, forced, or bought marriages. The group leaders met every seven days to report on the situation. When encountering more complex problems, Wang Guiying personally went to investigate and analyzed the situation with the branch secretary and street leader at any time, and then dealt with it. The active support and encouragement of the Party and the government gave her more confidence in her work.

There was a woman named Yu Cong in the Third Street, who was arranged by her parents to marry Li Changhou, who was more than thirty years older than her. Li Changhou had been a platoon leader in the puppet army in the past, and he was fierce and brutal, and had always beaten and abused her. She was tortured to the point of being yellow and thin, and both of her children died of starvation because they had no milk to eat. Yu Cong had wanted to get a divorce for a long time, but she didn't dare to bring it up; at that time, there was no way to solve it even if she brought it up. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, with the support of Wang Guiying, she filed for divorce with the court. On the day the court granted the divorce, Li Changhou took out a knife and sharpened it brightly, and Yu Cong was very scared. Wang Guiying knew about it and said to Yu Cong, "Don't be afraid, I will support you and make the decision for you." She immediately reported to the Peasants' Association, and the Peasants' Association criticized Li Changhou. Li Changhou promised to obey the court's judgment and would never threaten Yu Cong again. Yu Cong later married an honest farmer and became happy and healthy.

But Wang Guiying did not advocate rash divorce. She repeatedly investigated the marital problems of the masses. For example, the relationship between Li Mingxin and Yin Xiulian was not bad, but because her husband's seal-carving business could not make money and life was difficult, Yin Xiulian filed for divorce. Wang Guiying criticized Yin Xiulian and said, "The Communist Party is raising women to participate in production and labor and improve women's political status, not to ask women to file for divorce when they encounter difficulties in life, let alone that you have four children?" She helped them solve their difficulties; she lent Li Mingxin a peck of corn and three thousand yuan as capital to sell vegetables, and encouraged Yin Xiulian to do some needlework for others. Soon after, Li Mingxin found a job in Kaifeng and took his whole family there. The couple wrote to Wang Guiying from Kaifeng and said, "Thanks to you, otherwise our family would have been scattered long ago." Through this incident, the masses realized that the Marriage Law was not a divorce law. Many old women and middle-aged men who had opposed the Marriage Law reflected that the Communist Party's policy was correct, those who should be divorced should be divorced, and those who should not be divorced should not be divorced.

Wang Guiying is even more enthusiastic about supporting young people in their pursuit of freedom of marriage. Yan Yuhua and Li Damei were in love and often talked together, and the militiamen gossiped, "What are they doing? Are they engaging in corruption?" Wang Guiying was afraid of trouble, so she discussed it with her superiors and convened a meeting of militiamen to explain that love between men and women is not corruption, young people should strive for freedom of marriage, and others cannot interfere. Interference is illegal and will be punished. The militiamen all examined their past ignorance of the policy and promised to study the Marriage Law well in the future. Because education was carried out in advance, no incident of militiamen interfering with freedom of marriage has ever occurred in the Third Street. Wang Guiying also educated Yan Yuhua and Li Damei and said, "It is right for young people to fall in love, but production should be put first." Under her help and education, Yan Yuhua and Li Damei established a loving and mutually supportive family. Shortly after their marriage, Yan Yuhua encouraged her husband to go to the Huai River to work on the project. In October of last year, they were selected as model couples and participated in the Lushan County Model Representative Conference for Implementing the Marriage Law.

Wang Guiying often goes to the homes of the masses to visit. She knows the composition of each of the 374 households in the whole street, how many people there are, and whether the relationship between husband and wife and mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is good. When she finds a problem, she takes the initiative to persuade and educate. Even if she is rejected, she doesn't care. Wu Shuyun got married at the age of seventeen, and her husband died at the age of eighteen. Her parents-in-law did not want her to remarry, and she had been a widow for fifteen years. Wang Guiying repeatedly educated her parents-in-law, and Wu Shuyun finally got married happily. Many families where the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were at odds resolved their disputes and became harmonious through her persuasion. Through various specific examples and frequent propaganda and education, in the past two years, the marriage and family relations of the masses in the Third Street have undergone new changes. Arranged and bought marriages have disappeared, and men and women have gained freedom of marriage. One-third of the democratic and harmonious families have appeared in the whole street, and 37 households hold regular family meetings. Wang Guiying's own family has also changed. They have been allocated more than ten acres of land and two bright tile-roofed houses. Her husband has also raised his awareness, and he said to Wang Guiying, "Mother of the children, don't keep the past in mind. It's all my fault for having a feudal old mind." Their son is a silk weaver, their daughter goes to school, their daughter-in-law manages the household and takes care of the children, and Wang Guiying helps her husband with farming after she finishes work. She often educates her children and says, "Since the Communist Party came, we have land to cultivate, work to do, books to read, and a glorious position. We can't just take care of ourselves after we have turned over. Whatever the Party and the government call on us to do, we must do it." Because of Wang Guiying's concern and responsibility for the masses, she has won the enthusiastic support of the masses, and was elected as the street leader of the Third Street in last year's democratic movement.

When others asked Wang Guiying what experience she had in implementing the Marriage Law, Wang Guiying smiled and said, "I, this old woman, can't say anything about experience, I just have quick legs and a quick mouth, understanding the situation from door to door, and prescribing the right medicine for the disease. If I am not sure about solving the problem, I will go to the superiors to discuss it. Without the leadership of the Party, what could I have done?"

    贯彻婚姻法的模范干部王桂英
    左诵芬
    王桂英是河南省鲁山县城区三街的女街长，在去年十月间被选为贯彻婚姻法的模范干部，出席了鲁山县贯彻婚姻法模范代表大会。
    王桂英今年四十八岁，原是山东人，六岁时，因为黄河决口，跟着爹娘逃荒要饭来到鲁山。不久，爹死了，母亲迫不得已把她卖给人家当童养媳，换了八串钱，给爹买了口棺材。婆婆嫌她“脸丑脚大”，经常虐待她；伯伯和丈夫帮着打。几十年来，她挨打、受骂、挨饿、受冻，吃够了苦。她问别人：穷人和女人为什么这样苦？人们说这是“命”。她曾上过吊，被邻居救活了，但自杀的念头却没断过。后来她碰见到鲁山的山东老乡，告诉她“红军快来了，红军分给穷人地，还解放妇女”，从那一天起，王桂英才在黑暗里看到了光明。她天天盼望着“红军”。
    一九四七年，“红军”终于来了，鲁山县解放了，王桂英看到了亲人。她帮助解放军烧茶，洗衣，向解放军反映情况。不久，她参加了妇女会。她的丈夫对她说：“红军不长久，中央军来了杀你的头。”王桂英坚决地回答说：“只要我能过几天解放日子，杀我的头也愿意！”她团结了本街的妇女，斗争恶霸、地主，收集一贯道的活动材料。后来她被选为街妇女会主任，并在一九四九年参加了中国共产党。在党的教育下，他逐渐懂得了：穷人和妇女受苦不是因为“命”，而是社会制度不合理。她懂得了怎样求解放。
    一九五○年婚姻法公布后，鲁山县县委、县人民政府、县妇联，召集各街干部举行了三天座谈会，讨论婚姻法的精神和布置宣传任务。王桂英参加座谈会后兴奋得连觉都睡不着。一方面，她曾亲身体会到封建婚姻的痛苦，觉得婚姻法太好了；另一方面，她在工作中体会到封建家庭对妇女的压迫和限制是发动妇女的最大障碍。因此，她急着要向群众宣传，又怕记不清婚姻法的意思，夜晚就叫女儿一条一条念给她听。
    可是，王桂英一开始宣传就碰到了困难。她发现有些群众并不像她那样欢迎婚姻法。有人说：婚姻法叫人离婚，拆散家庭；有人说：共产党的政策都好，就是婚姻法破坏了自古以来的规矩；尤其是老太婆们更议论纷纷：大家自由啦，天下可不知要乱成啥样子哩！王桂英感到苦恼。但是，她记起了县委负责同志的话：“共产党员决不向困难低头。”也想起了县妇联主任对她的教育：“妇女干部应该带头执行婚姻法。”她决定先冲破思想最封建的一关，首先召开了个老婆婆会。起初，大家都不讲话，王桂英便带头诉说她过去所遭受的压迫和痛苦。大家听了王桂英的诉苦，都拿袖子擦眼泪。一个叫贾清的老太婆也跟着诉说了她和王桂英一样的痛苦：受虐待、打骂，婆家嫌她娘家穷，十五年来不准她和娘家来往。贾清说着便大哭，别人也跟着哭。大家纷纷诉起苦来：有的诉说本身的遭遇，有的诉说自己的闺女所受的痛苦。王桂英便抓紧这个机会宣传封建婚姻制度的罪恶，婚姻法的好处，并动员贾清到群众大会上去诉苦。通过诉苦，激起了群众对封建婚姻制度的憎恨，好几个做父母的当场表示再不包办儿女的婚姻。
    三街的干部又商量组织广播筒、黑板报、秧歌队和剧团宣传婚姻法。群众虽然对扭秧歌、看戏感到兴趣，但是自己却不愿意参加，尤其剧团更不容易组织，很多人认为唱戏是“丢人”。王桂英带头扭秧歌，并动员女儿参加剧团。接着有八、九个青年男女都参加了。这个剧团，二年多来演出了不少宣传婚姻法的节目，对贯彻婚姻法起了推动作用。
    通过剧团、黑板报、广播筒等各种方式宣传，群众对婚姻法逐渐有了认识，但还是有许多顾虑。有的寡妇心里虽然愿意改嫁，但没有勇气；有的妇女深受不合理婚姻的压迫，但不敢起来向封建势力作斗争；青年男女谈恋爱，群众还看不惯。王桂英便去找支部书记，研究怎样进一步深入贯彻。在支部的领导和帮助下，组织了本街的二十个妇女宣传员，四人一组，分片挨户进行宣传，并深入调查有没有虐待打骂现象，有没有包办强迫和买卖婚姻。组长七天一碰头，汇报情况。碰到比较复杂的问题，王桂英便亲自去调查，并且随时与支部书记、街长分析情况，然后再进行处理。党和政府对她的积极支持和鼓励，更增加了她工作的信心。
    三街有一个妇女叫余聪，由父母包办嫁给了比她大三十多岁的李昌候。李昌候过去当过伪军排长，性情凶暴，一贯打骂虐待她。她被折磨得又黄又瘦，生了两个孩子，都因为没奶吃饿死了。余聪早就想离婚，可是不敢提出来；那时提出来也没有办法解决。婚姻法公布后，她得到王桂英的支持，向法院提出离婚。法院判准离婚的那天，李昌候拿出一把刀来，磨得光光的，余聪非常害怕。王桂英知道了，对余聪说：“不要怕，我给你撑腰作主。”她立即报告农会，农会向李昌候进行了批评。李昌候保证服从法院判决，以后再也不威胁余聪。余聪后来和一个老实农民结了婚，变得快乐而健康。
    但是王桂英并不赞成轻率离婚。她帮助群众处理婚姻问题都经过反复调查。例如黎明新和殷秀莲夫妻感情本来不坏，只是因为丈夫做刻字生意赚不到钱，生活困难，殷秀莲便提出离婚要求。王桂英批评殷秀莲说：“共产党提高妇女，是要妇女参加生产劳动，提高妇女政治地位，不是叫妇女遇见生活困难就提离婚，何况你们还有四个孩子呢？”她帮助他们解决困难；借给黎明新一斗玉米、三千块钱做本钱，贩卖青菜，又鼓励殷秀莲帮人家做点针线活。不久，黎明新去开封找到了工作，把全家人都接去了。他们夫妇从开封写信给王桂英说：“幸亏你，不然我们一家人早就分散了。”通过这件事，群众认识到婚姻法并不是离婚法。很多曾经反对婚姻法的老婆婆和中年的男人反映：共产党的政策是对的，该离的离，不该离的不离。
    王桂英对青年人争取婚姻自由更是热心支持。严玉华和李大梅恋爱，常在一起谈话，民兵们就说闲话：“他们在搞啥？是不是搞腐化？”王桂英怕出乱子，便和上级商量好，召集民兵开了个会，说明男女恋爱并不是腐化，青年人应该争取婚姻自由，别人不能干涉，干涉就是犯法，要受处罚。民兵们都检讨了过去不懂政策，保证以后好好学习婚姻法。由于事前进行了教育，三街从来没有发生过民兵干涉婚姻自由的事情。王桂英同时教育严玉华和李大梅说：“青年人恋爱是正当的，但要把生产放在头一位。”严玉华和李大梅在她的帮助教育下，建立了互爱互助的家庭。婚后不久，严玉华就鼓励丈夫去治淮。去年十月他们被选为模范夫妇，参加了鲁山县贯彻婚姻法模范代表大会。
    王桂英常常到群众家里去访问。全街三百七十四户人家，每个家庭是什么成份，有多少人，夫妻之间、婆媳之间的关系好不好，她心中都有数。发现了什么问题，她便主动地去进行说服教育。即使碰了钉子，也不计较。吴淑云十七岁结婚，十八岁丈夫死了，公婆不愿她改嫁，一直守了十五年寡。王桂英反复对她公婆进行教育，吴淑云终于美满地结了婚。很多婆媳不和的家庭，经过她的说服，解决了纠纷，变得和睦了。通过各种不同的具体的事例以及经常的宣传教育，二年多来，三街群众的婚姻与家庭关系起了新的变化。包办、买卖婚姻已经绝迹，男女获得了婚姻自由。全街出现了三分之一的民主和睦家庭，有三十七户经常召开家庭会议。王桂英自己的家庭也变了样。他们分得了十多亩地，二间明亮的瓦房。丈夫也提高了觉悟，他对王桂英说：“孩子的娘，过去的事情，你不要记在心里。那都怪我封建老脑筋。”他们的儿子是织绸工人，女儿上学，媳妇管家务带孩子，王桂英工作完了，便帮助丈夫种地。她常常教育子女说：“共产党来了，咱有地种，有工做，有书读，还有光荣的地位。咱翻了身可不要只顾自己。党和政府号召咱干啥，咱就要干啥。”由于王桂英对群众的关心和负责，获得了群众热烈的拥护，在去年民主运动中被选为三街的街长。
    当别人询问王桂英对贯彻婚姻法有什么经验的时候，王桂英笑眯眯地说：“俺这老婆子说不出什么经验，俺只是腿快、嘴快，挨户挨家了解情况，啥病下啥药。自己没有把握解决的问题，便去找上级商量着办。如果没有党的领导，俺又能做出什么事情来呢。”
