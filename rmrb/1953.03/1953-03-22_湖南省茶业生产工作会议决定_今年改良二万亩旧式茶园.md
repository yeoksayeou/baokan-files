    Hunan Provincial Tea Production Work Conference Decides to Improve 20,000 Mu of Old Tea Gardens This Year
    The recent Hunan Provincial Tea Production Work Conference was held. The conference summarized the achievements and shortcomings of tea production in Hunan Province over the past three years, widely exchanged advanced work experience and production techniques, and decided that this year, the tea areas of the province should improve more than 20,000 mu of old tea gardens into new-style tea gardens, mainly for the production of high-grade export black tea, green tea, and border-sale brick tea, with appropriate consideration given to the production of domestic oolong tea. It is required that this year's yield per unit area should be increased by 10% compared to last year.
    Over the past three years, the Hunan Provincial People's Government has led and supported tea farmers to actively engage in tea production, and has achieved relatively significant results. In terms of restoring tea gardens: the province has reclaimed 400,000 mu of barren tea gardens, expanded 70,000 mu of new-style tea gardens, and reorganized 600,000 mu of existing tea gardens. In terms of improving tea quality: last year's first and second grade teas accounted for approximately 38.5% of the total output, an increase of 26% compared to 1950. However, the tea purchasing time was previously dragged out for too long, which directly affected the production of farmers. The technical guidance work for tea farmers was also done poorly due to insufficient cadre strength. In order to strengthen the leadership of tea production and solve the problems of tea purchasing and pricing, the Hunan Provincial Company of the China Tea Corporation has decided to appropriately increase this year's tea prices, and train tea evaluation personnel to ensure accurate grading and better prices for better tea; at the same time, it has decided to appropriately increase the number of purchasing stations in the tea areas to organize timely purchasing. In order to popularize tea planting techniques, this year the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry will mobilize fifteen technical cadres to guide and assist tea farmers in fertilization, replanting, intercropping with beans, and pest control; at the same time, it has decided to carry out large-scale technical education work for tea farmers in the tea areas, so that all tea gardens adopt scientific cultivation and harvesting methods to improve tea quality.
    After the meeting, cadres from various tea-producing areas returned to their original places to assist tea farmers in spring tea harvesting and production. (According to Xinhua News Agency report)

    湖南省茶业生产工作会议决定
    今年改良二万亩旧式茶园
    湖南省最近召开了第一次茶业生产工作会议。会议在总结过去三年来湖南省茶业生产的成绩和缺点上，广泛地交流了先进的工作经验和生产技术；并决定今年全省茶区要改良二万多亩旧式茶园为新式茶园，以生产高级的外销红茶、绿茶和边销黑茶为主，适当照顾内销青茶的生产，要求今年的单位面积产量较去年提高百分之十。
    三年来，湖南省人民政府领导和扶植植茶农民积极进行茶业生产，已有较为显著的成绩。在恢复茶园方面：全省共垦复了荒芜茶园四十万亩，扩大新式茶园七万亩，整理现有茶园六十万亩。在提高茶叶品质方面：去年所产的一、二级茶叶约占总产量的百分之三十八点五，较一九五○年增加了百分之二十六。但是，以往茶叶收购的时间拖得很长，直接影响了农民的生产。对植茶农民的技术指导工作，也因为干部力量不足而做得较差。为加强领导茶业生产，解决茶叶的收购、价格问题，中国茶业公司湖南省公司已决定把今年的茶叶价格适当提高，并训练评茶人员，以做到评级准确，优茶优价；同时，决定在茶区适当增设收购站，及时组织收购。为了普及植茶技术，今年湖南省农林厅一面调集十五个技术干部，到茶区指导和协助植茶农民作施肥、补株、豆类间作和治虫工作；一面决定在茶区大规模开展对植茶农民的技术教育工作，做到全部茶园采用科学的栽培和采制方法，提高茶叶品质。
    会后，各个产茶区的干部都回到原地，协助植茶农民采制春茶工作。（据新华社讯）
