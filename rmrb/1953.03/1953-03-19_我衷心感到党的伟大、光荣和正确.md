    I Sincerely Feel the Greatness, Glory, and Correctness of the Party
    Xue Chengfeng, Student of Jiaotong University

    On the afternoon of January 15th, I attended a conference at the East China Transportation College, where I heard Hu Lijiao, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the East China Bureau, announce the decision of the Discipline Inspection Commission of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to expel the anti-Party element Huang Yifeng from the Party. At that moment, I was extremely excited and shouted from the bottom of my heart: "How great, glorious, and correct the Party is!"

    I was originally the child of a worker from Pingnan County, Fujian Province. Before liberation, I suffered like millions of other oppressed people. My two older sisters were forced to be sold as child brides. After liberation, I, a "poor boy," also had the opportunity to go to school. I knew that this happiness was all brought to me by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. In the autumn of 1951, East China universities held unified enrollment in Fujian, and I applied. After being admitted, I was assigned to study in the Mechanical Engineering Department of the East China Transportation College. How happy I was! After entering the school, I found that there were many shortcomings in the school's work. Because my hometown is an old revolutionary base area, the people have a historical tradition of trusting and loving the Party; especially the spirit and heroism of many martyrs who bravely sacrificed and generously died for the people's revolutionary cause before liberation, which made the people infinitely admire the Party. Before liberation, I already had some understanding of the Party; after liberation, I personally received the Party's education, and I trusted and loved the Party even more, and cared more about the Party's interests. Therefore, I wrote to the People's Daily, criticizing the shortcomings in the school's work.

    After the People's Daily published my letter of criticism on December 3, 1951, Huang Yifeng not only did not improve his work based on the criticism from the masses, but instead carried out a series of attacks and persecutions against me. He used various despicable methods to force me to make self-criticisms, "mobilized the masses" to struggle against me, and repeatedly forced me to write an application for withdrawal from school, attempting to drive me out of the school gate. He even more shamelessly withheld my incoming and outgoing family letters, and wrote to my family, falsely claiming that I had a serious illness and asking my father to take me home, causing shock and anxiety to my entire family.

    During the long-term persecution by Huang Yifeng, I also had some wrong ideas. But when I thought of the Party's correct handling of the Ji Kaifu and Zhang Shunyou incidents, I strengthened my courage and confidence in the struggle. I wrote letters to the People's Daily continuously to report the situation of retaliation. Later, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the East China Bureau sent an inspection team to educate and encourage me. Finally, they correctly handled the Huang Yifeng suppression of criticism incident and cleared the anti-Party element Huang Yifeng from the Party. This made me deeply believe that the Party is truly loyal to the interests of the people and is truly selfless; the Party will never be lenient or tolerant towards Party members who have committed serious mistakes because of their high position and seniority. At the same time, I also further realized that the Party is determined to carry out the struggle of criticism and self-criticism, and fully supports healthy criticism from the masses. I must better use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, respond to Chairman Mao's call, and devote myself to the struggle against bureaucracy and contribute my own strength.

    In order to live up to the cultivation of the Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, I am determined to study politics and technology hard, improve my class consciousness, constantly correct my shortcomings, further move closer to the Party, and strive to join the League with practical actions, be an assistant to the Party, and work hard to build a great motherland.

    我衷心感到党的伟大、光荣和正确
    交通大学学生　薛承凤
    一月十五日下午，我参加了华东交通专科学校的大会，听到华东局组织部副部长胡立教同志宣布中共中央华东局纪律检查委员会开除反党分子黄逸峰党籍的决定。当时我兴奋极了，从内心里喊出一句话：“党是多么伟大、光荣、正确啊！”
    我原是福建省屏南县一个工人的孩子。解放前我和千千万万被压迫的人们一样地受着苦难，我的两个姐姐就是被迫卖给人家作童养媳的。解放后，我这个“穷小子”也有了升学的机会。我知道这种幸福都是共产党、毛主席带给我的。一九五一年秋，华东各大学在福建统一招生，我去投考，录取后被分配在华东交通专科学校机械科学习。我是多么高兴呀！进学校后，我发现学校的工作有很多缺点。因为我的家乡是革命老根据地，人民对党的信任与热爱是有着历史传统的；尤其解放前许多先烈为人民革命事业英勇牺牲、慷慨就义的斗争精神和英雄气概，更使人民对党无限敬仰。在解放前，我对党已经有了一些认识；解放以后，我亲身受到党的教育，就更信任党和爱戴党，也更关心党的利益。因此，我就写信给人民日报，对学校工作中的缺点提出批评。
    一九五一年十二月三日人民日报登出了我的批评信后，黄逸峰非但不根据群众批评改进工作，相反地却对我进行了一系列的打击和迫害。他用各种卑鄙的办法逼令我作检讨，“发动群众”斗争我，还再三逼我写退学申请书，企图把我赶出学校的大门。他更无耻地扣留我的来往家信，并写信骗我家里，说我害了重病，要我父亲来把我带领回家，害得我全家震惊不安。
    在受到黄逸峰长期的迫害过程中，我也曾经有过一些错误的想法。但是当我想到党对纪凯夫事件和张顺有事件的正确处理时，我又增强了斗争的勇气和信心。我曾连续写信向人民日报报告受报复的情况。之后，华东局纪律检查委员会派来检查组，对我进行了教育和鼓励，最后，并对黄逸峰压制批评事件作了正确的处理，把反党分子黄逸峰清除出党。这使我深刻地信任党是真正的忠于人民群众的利益的，是真正的大公无私的；党对于犯了严重错误的党员，决不会因为他的地位高和资格老而迁就姑息。同时我也更进一步地认识党对开展批评与自我批评的斗争是坚决的，对来自群众的健康的批评是全力支持的。我一定要更好地运用批评与自我批评的武器，响应毛主席的号召、投入反官僚主义的斗争，贡献出自己的力量。
    为了不辜负党和毛主席以及人民政府对我的培养，我决心努力学习政治和技术，提高阶级觉悟，不断改正自己的缺点，进一步靠拢党，以实际行动争取入团，作一个党的助手，为建设伟大的祖国而努力。
