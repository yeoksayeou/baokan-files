    全苏工会中央理事会开会
    选举什维尔尼克为理事会主席
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：全苏工会中央理事会最近举行了第十次全体会议。鉴于瓦·瓦·库兹涅佐夫已被任命为苏联外交部副部长，全体会议特解除他的全苏工会中央理事会主席的职务，并选举尼·米·什维尔尼克为全苏工会中央理事会主席。
    全体会议并通过了致苏联共产党中央委员会的信，信中说：在我国各族人民悲痛的日子里，在英明的领袖和导师斯大林离开我们之后，全苏工会中央理事会第十次全体会议谨向苏联共产党中央委员会保证：工会及各级组织将更加努力地把广大职工群众进一步团结在亲爱的共产党和它的中央委员会的周围，把他们团结起来从事我国伟大的共产主义建设事业，为完成和超额完成第五个五年计划展开社会主义竞赛，并将更关心职工物质福利的进一步提高。
