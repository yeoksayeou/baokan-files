Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 25th: A special correspondent from this agency reports: The U.S. side has fabricated a whole set of excuses, preparing to more openly sabotage various agreements in the Panmunjom meeting area from the ground and air, in order to completely break the Korean armistice negotiations. On the 21st, two U.S. aircraft intruded into the airspace above the meeting area, taking advantage of the area being free from our artillery fire to bomb and strafe our nearby positions. On the same afternoon, while security officers from both sides were investigating this violation of the agreement in Panmunjom, four U.S. aircraft again intruded into the airspace above the meeting area and attacked our nearby positions. U.S. security officers witnessed this event and had to nod in acknowledgement. However, on the 23rd, U.S. aircraft once again intruded into the meeting area. The reason why U.S. aircraft are so rampant is because the U.S. side has brazenly announced that flying over the meeting area does not violate the agreement, even though the agreement between the two sides clearly stipulates that "except in cases where climate and technical conditions are uncontrollable, military aircraft of both sides shall not fly over the Panmunjom meeting area."

The U.S. side's method of denying responsibility is extremely shameless. They once instructed U.S. military police in the meeting area to deliberately ignore calls from our military police when U.S. aircraft flew over the meeting area, staring straight ahead, and then claim afterwards that they did not see any U.S. aircraft flying over. One U.S. military policeman, compelled by the facts, used a pencil to draw a line on a diagram of the meeting area drawn by our military police, indicating the direction of the U.S. aircraft's flight. However, in the joint investigation that followed, this American soldier, under the instruction of his superiors, blushed and lied to our face, insisting that he did not know who drew that line. When the fact of the overflight was undeniable, the U.S. side routinely said that the overflying aircraft were of "unidentified nationality," although witnesses unanimously said that the intruding aircraft were of the U.S. type, and these aircraft frequently attacked our nearby positions from above the meeting area. When this fact was also undeniable, the U.S. side cunningly claimed that it was due to "difficulties in climate and technical conditions." Our liaison officer asked U.S. liaison officer Calk的具体说明困难何在 (specific explanation of the difficulties), and Calk's response was, as usual, "I have nothing more to say." Finally, Calk exhausted his tricks and simply said that even if U.S. aircraft flew over the meeting area, it would not violate the agreement.

Regarding the U.S. side's shelling of the meeting area, Calk recently even said that the responsibility lies with our side because there are our positions near the meeting area. This is an even more extremely shameless excuse. Since the demarcation of the Panmunjom meeting area in October 1951, it has always been situated between the positions of both sides, with U.S. positions on its edge as well as our positions. The agreement reached by both sides at that time was unambiguous: no hostile acts shall be carried out against the meeting area. Moreover, after the U.S. side shelled the meeting area several times in the past, it was also forced to accept responsibility and express "regret."

Similarly, the U.S. side has fabricated shameful excuses for the actions of their armed agents who have repeatedly attacked the meeting area. Although all evidence confirms that these agents came from U.S. positions and returned to U.S. positions; they left clear footprints and abandoned U.S.-made ammunition; Calk routinely said that they were "persons of unidentified status," saying that the U.S. side cannot be responsible for the actions of "persons of unidentified status." Obviously, according to the U.S. side's shameless logic—U.S. aircraft flying over the meeting area does not violate the agreement, the U.S. military shelling the meeting area should be our responsibility, and U.S. agents are "persons of unidentified status"—then the U.S. side can bombard the location of the armistice negotiations, and U.S. aircraft can arbitrarily fly over and attack the meeting area and the neutral zone. The existence of the Panmunjom meeting area is therefore in imminent danger.

### 美国侵略者阴谋彻底破坏朝鲜停战谈判  美方继续制造可耻借口抵赖破坏协议罪行

    美国侵略者阴谋彻底破坏朝鲜停战谈判
    美方继续制造可耻借口抵赖破坏协议罪行
    【新华社开城二十五日电】本社特派记者报道：美方已制造出一整套借口，准备更公开地从地面及空中破坏板门店会场区的各项协议，以彻底破裂朝鲜停战谈判。二十一日，美方飞机两架侵入会场区上空，利用区内免受我方炮火攻击的便利，对附近的我方阵地轰炸扫射。当天下午，双方安全军官正在板门店调查这一违反协议事件时，美机四架又侵入会场区上空，对附近的我方阵地攻击。美方安全军官目睹这一事件，只好点头承认。但在二十三日，美机却又一次侵越会场区。美机之所以如此猖狂，是因为美方已悍然宣布飞越会场区并不违反协议，虽然双方的协议明确规定，“除在气候条件与技术条件无法控制的情况下，双方军用飞机均不得飞越板门店会场区上空”。
    美方抵赖责任的方式是极其无耻的。他们曾经指示会场区的美方军事警察在美机飞越会场区时，故意不理我方军事警察的呼唤，双目平视，事后就说并未看见有美机飞越。有一个美方军事警察迫于事实，用铅笔在一张我方军事警察画的会场区示意图上画了一条表示美机飞越方向的线条，但在接着进行的双方共同调查中，这个美国兵却在他的上级授意之下，面红耳赤地当面撒谎，硬说他不知道画那条线的人是谁。当确证飞越的事实无可抵赖之时，美方照例说飞越的飞机“国籍不明”，虽然证人一致说侵越的飞机是美方飞机的形式，而且这些飞机经常从会场区上空向我方附近的阵地攻击。当这一事实也无法抵赖时，美方就诡称是“气候及技术条件的困难”。我方联络官要求美方联络官卡洛克具体说明困难何在，卡洛克的回答照例是：“我没有别的话说。”最后，卡洛克黔驴技穷，就索性说即使美机飞越会场区也不违反协议。
    对于美方炮击会场区，卡洛克最近居然说责任在于我方，因为会场区附近有我方阵地，这更是极端无耻的借口。板门店会场区自一九五一年十月划定之时起，就一直处于双方阵地之间，其边缘有美方阵地，也有我方阵地，而双方当时达成的协议是毫不含糊的：对会场区不得进行任何敌对行为，而且美方过去数次炮击会场区之后，也曾被迫接受责任，表示“遗憾”。
    同样，美方对于他们武装特务多次攻击会场区的行为，也制造了可耻的借口。虽然一切证据确定这些特务来自美方阵地，回到美方阵地；他们留有清楚的脚印，遗下美制的弹药；但卡洛克却照例说他们是“身份不明之人”，说美方不能对“身份不明之人”的行为负责。显然，根据美方的无耻逻辑——美机飞越会场区并不违反协议，美军炮击会场区应由我方负责，美方特务是“身份不明之人”——那末美方对停战谈判的所在地尽可炮轰，美国飞机对会场区和中立区尽可任意飞越，任意袭击，而板门店会场区的存在也就岌岌可危了。
