Blindly Formulating Plans and No One Responsible for Management
Nanjing Machine Factory Wastes and Damages Large Quantities of New Equipment

The Nanjing Machine Factory exhibited great blindness in determining equipment plans for capital construction. After the machines arrived, there was no one responsible for managing them, resulting in the waste and damage of large quantities of valuable new machines.

At the beginning of last year, the former East China Industrial Department had not yet finalized the product plan for the Nanjing Machine Factory, but instructed the factory to develop a plan for expanding mechanical equipment according to the requirements of producing medium-sized machine tools. The factory's Deputy Director, Diao Jiaxiang, without conducting any investigation or calculation, hurriedly produced the plan in four days. According to this plan, the factory ordered many new-style machine tools from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, using the main part of the capital construction investment. These included high-speed lathes, grinders, milling machines, broaching machines, sawing machines, boring machines, and gear shapers, all of which were precision-built and had high kinetic energy. The factory's plan was inherently very blind. In the middle of the process, the higher authorities changed the factory's product plan twice, from medium-sized machine tools to small-sized machine tools. But by this time, the machines had already been ordered, and when they arrived successively in July and August, they were either too large or too small, and did not meet the needs of production.

At the same time, the leading cadres of the factory were very active in buying new machines, but adopted an intolerable bureaucratic attitude towards specific organizational work. After the ordered machines were transported to the factory, there was no set of management system, and no education was conducted for employees on how to cherish and use the new machines. As a result, from transportation, loading and unloading, to storage, installation, and use, the entire process was in a state of no one being responsible. Some machines were left in the open, exposed to the wind and rain, with no one caring about them. Each of these machines had a detailed instruction manual. Everything was clearly explained, from transportation (including how to hook and lift when getting on and off trains and ships), installation (including the shape of the foot and foot screws, and the standard of concrete) to use (including circuits, lubrication, etc.). However, because no one supervised or inspected, the technical section responsible for translating the instruction manuals has not yet translated them. Because the machines were not transported, installed, and used according to the machine instruction manuals, 70% of the machines that have already been installed and used have experienced failures and damage. For example, precision machine tools are most sensitive to vibration, but the factory was very careless during transportation. When transporting the broaching machine, the crane was used to lift the broaching machine from the truck, and it was dropped when it was still more than a foot above the ground, and the oil inside the box was spilled. New machines are not inspected at all when they enter the factory. Some machines, due to long-distance transportation, had dry grease in the ball plates, but this was not discovered. Even after two months of use, the motor ball plate of a lathe was burned out due to dry grease, and no one noticed. It was not until December of last year, when an accident occurred with the surface grinder, and it was discovered that the headstock ball plate was also burned out, that the maintenance department comprehensively inspected the new machines. During installation, according to the instructions, the foot of the high-speed lathe should be made into a complete piece to prevent the lathe from shaking during high-speed rotation. However, the factory made the foot into two pieces, and the depth of the foot and the composition of the concrete did not meet the requirements. As a result, the high-speed lathe could not run at high speed. Some lathe headstocks have a speed of 2,800 revolutions per minute, but now they can only run at 1,400 revolutions per minute, and any more will cause the lathe to vibrate violently. For example, the foot screws of the boring machine should be "T" shaped, but the factory used "human" shaped ones, and as a result, the bed was uneven due to the insecure foot. In addition, because workers have not been educated on how to use the machines, some machines have been damaged during use. For example, worker Qiang Quande did not understand the suction performance of the surface grinder's electromagnet. During operation, he did not suck the workpiece firmly. As a result, the workpiece was thrown far away as soon as it was started, and the surface of the bed's electromagnet was worn. The maintenance and repair of new machines are also not done well. For example, when refueling the boring machine's ball plate, iron filings were accidentally brought in. As a result, the sound of the ball plate was very loud when starting, and the ball plates of two machines were damaged.

The reasons for the above situation, in addition to the many shortcomings in the factory's management organization, are also due to the fact that some of the factory's employees do not truly understand the new achievements of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia in industrial technology. Some people subjectively believe that the machines from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia are similar to those from the United States and Britain, and it doesn't matter if the installation is sloppy, so not only were some machine feet made carelessly, but some milling machines and hobbing machines were used without any feet at all. Some people have never used or seen Soviet and Czechoslovakian machines before, but treat them with an empiricist attitude and do not study the instruction manuals at all, resulting in many loopholes. There are also some people who only see that the appearance of Soviet and Czechoslovakian machines is not "beautiful," so they despise them and are not conscientious and responsible during installation and use. Some even say that the "machines themselves are not good" when they find that their installation or use is not working well. Once, when installing a sawing machine, the saw blade just wouldn't go to the workpiece. The technicians of the electromechanical section took it apart for research and studied it for two weeks without finding anything wrong. Later, the head of the electromechanical section discovered that the pressure on the workpiece was insufficient, so he increased the pressure and tried it. The saw blade quickly passed through. What other sawing machines can do in two hours, it only takes a dozen minutes. Only then did everyone suddenly realize that this was a semi-automatic metal sawing machine. If the pressure on the workpiece is insufficient, the saw blade will not come down, which is a safety device.

    盲目制订计划无人负责管理
    南京机器厂浪费和损坏大批新设备
    南京机器厂在确定基本建设的设备计划时，盲目性很大；机器运来之后，又没有人负责管理；以致大批贵重的新机器被浪费着和损坏着。
    去年年初，原华东工业部还没有最后确定南京机器厂的产品方案，就指示该厂按生产中型工作母机的要求作出扩大机械设备的计划。该厂副厂长刁家翔也没有调查核算，匆匆地在四天内就把计划做了出来。按照这个计划，该厂以基本建设投资的主要部分向苏联和捷克等兄弟国家订购了许多新式的工作母机，有高速车床、磨床、铣床、铅床、锯床、搪床和铡齿机等，都是构造精密、动能极高的机器。该厂的计划本来盲目性就很大，中途，上级机关又两度变更了该厂的产品方案，由中型工作母机改为小型工作母机。但这时机器已经订妥，到七、八月间机器陆续运来以后，不是太大就是太小，不切合生产的需要。
    同时，该厂的领导干部，对买新机器很积极，但对具体的组织工作却采取了不可容忍的官僚主义态度。订购的机器，运到厂里来后，没有一套保管制度，也没有对职工进行爱护新机器和如何使用新机器的教育。以致从运输、装卸到保管、安装和使用，整个都处于无人负责的状态。有些机器丢在露天地里，任凭风吹雨淋，无人过问。这些机器，每一部都有一份详细的说明书。从运输（包括上下车船时怎样搭钩子，怎样吊法）、安装（包括地脚和地脚螺丝的形状，混凝土的标准）到使用（包括电路、润油等），都交代得清清楚楚。但是因为没有人督促检查，负责翻译说明书的技术课到现在还没有把说明书翻译出来。由于没有按照机器说明书来搬运、安装和使用，现在已经安好使用的机器有百分之七十发生了故障，受到了损坏。譬如，精密的工作母机是最忌震动的，但该厂在搬运时却非常马虎。搬运拉床时，用吊车把拉床从汽车上吊下来，离地面还有一尺多高就往下摔，把箱子里面的机油都摔出来了。新机器进厂，一律不检查。有些机器由于经过长途的运输，弹子盘的油脂已经干了，也没有发现。甚至使用两个月以后，有一部车床的马达弹子盘因油脂干涸而烧坏了，还没有人注意。直到去年十二月，大平磨发生事故，又发现车头弹子盘也烧坏了，保修部门才全面地检查新机器。安装时，按说明书的规定，高速车床的地脚应该打成完整的一块，以防止车床在高速转动时摇动。但是该厂却把地脚打成两块，地脚的深度和混凝土的成分也不合规定。结果使高速车床不能开高速，有些车床的车头转数是每分钟二千八百转，现在只能开到一千四百转，再多了车床就要剧烈震动。又如搪床的地脚螺丝应该用“丁”字形的，该厂却用了“人”字形的，结果也因地脚不牢使得床身不平。此外，由于没有向工人进行过如何使用机器的教育，有些机器在使用时被弄坏了。如工人强泉德不懂得太平面磨床吸铁的性能，操作时没有把工作物吸牢，结果一开车工作物就被打出老远，把床面吸铁磨损了。新机器的保养和修理工作也做得很不好，例如在给搪床的弹子盘加油时，不留神把铁屑带进去了，结果开车时弹子盘的声音很大，有两部机器的弹子盘损坏了。
    产生以上情况的原因，除了工厂管理的组织工作上存在很多缺点以外，还由于该厂有些职工没有真正了解苏联和捷克等兄弟国家在工业技术上的新成就。有的人主观地认为苏联和捷克的机器与英美机器差不多，安装马虎些没关系，所以不仅有些机器的地脚打得草率，甚至有些铣床、滚床根本没打地脚就使用起来了。有的人过去没有使用过或看到过苏联、捷克机器，然而却以经验主义的态度来对待它们，根本不去研究说明书，结果弄得漏洞百出。还有一些人只看到苏联和捷克机器的外表上并不“漂亮”，于是就轻视它，在安装和使用时就不认真负责，甚至当自己安装或使用得不灵时，反倒说“机器本身不好”。有一次安装一部锯床时，弄来弄去锯片就是不往工作物上去，机电课的技术人员把它拆下来研究，弄了两个星期，什么毛病也没有，后来机电课长才发现是工作物上的压力不够，于是加大了压力一试，锯片很快就过来了，别的锯床两个钟点的工作它只要十几分钟就够了。这一来大家才恍然大悟，晓得这是一部半自动的金属锯床，工作物上压力不够，锯片就不下来，乃是一种安全装置。
