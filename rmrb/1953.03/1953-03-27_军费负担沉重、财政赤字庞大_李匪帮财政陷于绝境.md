    Heavy Military Burden, Huge Financial Deficit
    The Li Clique's Finances in Desperate Straits
    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] The Li Seung-man clique's finances are in desperate straits due to the heavy burden of military spending. According to the United Press, Paik Too-chin, the "Acting Prime Minister" of the Li Seung-man puppet regime, said in a statement on the 21st that due to the heavy burden of the war and the need to support a huge army, "our already very difficult financial situation is nearing the point of collapse." He admitted that the vast majority of the huge budget proposed by the puppet regime for this year has been used for military spending. In order to cope with this huge expenditure, the puppet regime has been levying exorbitant taxes and desperately squeezing the people of South Korea. The total amount of adjusted taxes accounts for 49 percent of South Korea's total production. He had to admit that the taxes were "too heavy." But despite this, there is still a huge deficit in the puppet regime's budget that cannot be made up. He then wagged his tail and begged the United States to "generously provide real and full assistance." He said to his American masters that without massive foreign aid, "our war efforts will be hampered."
    According to Xinhua News Agency: "Pravda" published a dispatch from Pyongyang by its reporter Bo Chengke, who described the situation in South Korea based on reports in South Korean newspapers.
    Bo Chengke wrote: The disaster-stricken people of South Korea are suffering from the cruel oppression of the American occupiers and the Li Seung-man clique. The fate of these millions of people is labor, unemployment, and extreme poverty. "The Dong-A Ilbo" inadvertently mentioned that tungsten miners in Dacheon are forced to work for a quarter of their usual wages. Local tycoons, together with the American occupiers, are enriching themselves by producing and exporting tungsten sand. American companies are unwilling to take any risks, so they have not invested a penny in South Korea's mining industry. Tungsten, graphite, and copper are all mined using old methods, and accidents often occur in the mines. Mine owners ruthlessly exploit cheap child labor. Boys and girls as young as twelve are forced to work underground for eleven hours a day and do night shifts.
    The living conditions of the miners are extremely difficult. They live in very crowded conditions, and the food is extremely bad. The mortality rate is alarmingly high. Hungry people are prone to lung diseases and other illnesses, which are very common among them. In Chungcheongnam-do, which has tungsten mines, there is only one doctor for every 80,000 residents. But there are nine policemen for every hundred people. There are no schools, hospitals, or first-aid stations in the mining areas.
    The interventionist troops have brought infectious diseases to South Korea. According to the Li Seung-man puppet government, four-fifths of the women working in restaurants and eateries in Busan have contracted venereal diseases.
    Last year, South Korea's imports greatly exceeded its exports, and this trade deficit increased its debts and led to greater inflation in South Korea. The so-called "currency reform" implemented in South Korea was a major disaster for the people. The price of rice immediately rose by 40 percent. Li Seung-man's subordinates reaped great profits, while the general public suffered significant losses.

    军费负担沉重、财政赤字庞大
    李匪帮财政陷于绝境
    【新华社二十六日讯】李承晚匪帮由于军费负担沉重，财政已陷于绝境。据合众社透露：李承晚伪政权的“代理国务总理”白斗镇在二十一日发表的声明中说：由于战争重负和要供养一支巨大的陆军等原因，“我们的已经非常窘迫的财政状况，已快要到崩溃的地步了。”他承认：伪政权在今年度提出的巨额预算中已将绝大部分用作军费。为了应付这笔巨大的支出，伪政权横征暴敛拼命地压榨南朝鲜人民，调整后的赋税的总数，已占南朝鲜生产总数的百分之四十九。他不得不承认：赋税“过重”。但是尽管如此，在伪政权的预算中还有巨大的赤字无法弥补。他于是摇尾乞怜，要求美国“慷慨地给以真正的充分的援助”。他向美国主子说：若是没有外国的大量援助，“我们的战争努力要受到妨碍。”
    据新华社讯：“真理报”刊载了该报记者波诚科从平壤发来的一篇通讯，他以南朝鲜报纸的报道为根据描写了南朝鲜的情况。
    波诚科写道：灾难深重的南朝鲜人民，受着美国占领者和李承晚匪帮的残酷压迫。这千百万人民的命运就是劳役、失业和极端贫困。“东亚日报”曾不留心地提到，达城的钨矿矿工被迫在平常工资的四分之一的条件下工作。当地的富豪与美国占领者一起，正在靠生产和输出钨砂而自肥。美国公司因为不愿冒一点风险，所以没有在南朝鲜的采矿工业中投下一分钱。钨、石墨和铜，都是用老法在开采，矿里常常发生事故。矿主们无情地剥削廉价的童工劳动。十二岁的男女儿童被迫每天在地下工作十一小时，并要做夜班。
    矿工们的生活状况异常艰难。他们住得非常拥挤，食物坏到极点。死亡率高得惊人。饥饿的人很容易染上肺病和其他疾病，这些疾病在他们中间十分普遍。在有着钨矿的忠清南道，每八万个居民才有一个医生。但是每一百个人却有九个警察。采矿地区既没有学校和医院，也没有急救站。
    干涉军把传染病带到了南朝鲜。据李承晚傀儡政府承认，在釜山餐室和饭馆里工作的妇女，有五分之四染上了花柳病。
    去年南朝鲜的进口大大地超过了出口，这种贸易逆差使债务增多了，并且使得南朝鲜发生了更大的通货膨胀。南朝鲜实行的所谓“币制改革”，是人民的一个大灾祸。米价立即上涨了百分之四十。李承晚的属员们吞得了大利，而一般人民却受到了重大的损失。
