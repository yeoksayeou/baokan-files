Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: On March 11th, the United Nations General Assembly plenary session discussed the report of the Political Committee on the results of the discussion on the Korean question.

From the discussions in the Political Committee, it can be seen that the US-led Anglo-American bloc opposed the adoption of a resolution aimed at ending the Korean War and peacefully resolving the Korean question. These countries obstructed the passage of the Soviet proposal for an immediate ceasefire in Korea and the establishment of a committee to peacefully resolve the Korean question in the Political Committee. These countries forced the Political Committee to pass a proposal put forward by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, France, the Philippines, and Thailand, which stipulated the retention of the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" and the notorious "United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency" -- both of which served the US military command in Korea, which launched the war of aggression against the Korean people. The passage of this proposal by the Political Committee once again showed that the United States and its vassal states are trying to expand the Korean War.

At the United Nations General Assembly plenary session, some representatives explained their voting intentions before the proposals were put to a vote. Indonesian representative, Mr. Balar, said that the Assembly and its Political Committee must find new ways to solve the Korean question. He also said that a meeting between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States might be a new way to solve this problem. However, he also said that he felt it was not appropriate to make such a suggestion at this time.

The next speaker was British Foreign Secretary Eden, who tried his best to shift the responsibility for the failure to end the Korean War onto the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He attempted to portray the resolution on the issue of prisoners of war passed by the Anglo-American bloc during the first half of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly as a solution to the Korean question. In fact, everyone knows that this resolution was an attempt to continue the Korean War. Eden hypocritically said that the United States, the United Kingdom, and the countries that follow them sincerely hope to end the Korean War, but he also said that it is currently difficult to see any hope for an early realization of peace in Korea, thus refuting his own words.

Eden's attempt to conceal the aggressive policy of the Anglo-American bloc on the Korean question can only prove that the British government intends to support the US plan to expand the war in the Far East.

Soviet representative Gromyko then spoke (full text see separate telegram).

American representative Lodge spoke, repeating the slanders against the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Soviet Union. These slanderous lies had already been exposed by the Soviet delegation. In his speech, Lodge deliberately distorted the Soviet delegation's attitude towards the Korean question for a large part of the time. Lodge used this method to avoid answering the question of why the US ruling clique opposes resolving the Korean question and why the US ruling clique does not agree to a ceasefire in Korea.

Polish representative Skrzeszewski said that the current session of the United Nations General Assembly could have taken measures based on Soviet proposals to immediately and completely end the Korean War, thereby laying the foundation for a peaceful resolution of the entire Korean question. However, representatives of the Anglo-American bloc refused to accept the Soviet proposals. The Polish delegation supports the Soviet proposal to abolish the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea."

The Czechoslovak representative also supported the Soviet proposal, pointing out that the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" has actually become an appendage of the US military command in Korea.

Ukrainian Republic representative Baranovsky pointed out in his speech that the US attitude towards the Korean question not only proves that it is clearly unwilling to end the war of aggression it launched, but also exposes its open attempt to further expand the Korean War. The Ukrainian representative also criticized the resolution passed during the first half of the General Assembly, which deceived world public opinion, pointing out that the purpose of this resolution was to cover up the behavior of the US ruling clique in continuing to use the issue of prisoners of war as an excuse to prolong the Korean War, and to conceal the behavior of the US aggressors in preventing Korean and Chinese prisoners of war from returning home and secretly transferring them to the armies of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. Baranovsky finally expressed his support for the Soviet proposal.

Following him, Belarusian Republic representative Kiselev accused the US monopoly capitalists of painstakingly undermining the Panmunjom ceasefire negotiations and prolonging the Korean War in order to obtain huge profits. He also supported the Soviet proposal.

Five delegations (Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Poland) voted in favor of the Soviet proposal to abolish the so-called United Nations "Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea." The proposal to retain the United Nations "Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" was passed by a majority vote. The Soviet Union, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, and Poland voted against the proposal.

At this point, the General Assembly concluded its discussion on the Korean question. The discussion convincingly demonstrated that the US-led bloc in the United Nations continues to oppose a peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

### 联合国大会全体会议结束关于朝鲜问题的讨论  苏波等国代表谴责美国蓄意延长侵朝战争

    联合国大会全体会议结束关于朝鲜问题的讨论
    苏波等国代表谴责美国蓄意延长侵朝战争
    据新华社讯：三月十一日，联合国大会全体会议讨论政治委员会关于朝鲜问题讨论结果的报告。
    从政治委员会的讨论中可以看出，以美国为首的美英集团反对通过目的在结束朝鲜战争与和平解决朝鲜问题的决定。这些国家在政治委员会中阻挠通过苏联提出的立即在朝鲜停战及成立一个和平解决朝鲜问题委员会的提案。这些国家强使政治委员会通过了美国、英国、加拿大、丹麦、法国、菲律宾与泰国提出的一项提案，这个提案规定保留所谓“朝鲜统一复兴委员会”与臭名远扬的“联合国朝鲜复兴局”——这两个机构都是替对朝鲜人民发动侵略战争的朝鲜美军司令部服务的。政治委员会通过这个提案就再度表明：美国及其仆从国家正力图扩大朝鲜战争。
    在联合国大会全体会议上，在提案提付表决前，有些代表说明了他们的投票态度。印度尼西亚代表巴拉说，大会及其政治委员会必须寻找新的办法来解决朝鲜问题，他又说，苏联与美国两国政府首脑举行会议可能是解决这个问题的新办法。但是，他又说，他觉得在目前提出这样的建议是不适宜的。
    继起发言的是英国外交大臣艾登，他竭力企图把朝鲜战争不能结束的责任推到苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国身上。他试图把美英集团在联合国第七届大会前半期会议上所通过的关于战俘问题的决议说成是一种解决朝鲜问题的办法，而事实上，大家知道，这个决议是企图继续朝鲜战争的。艾登伪善地说，美国、英国和追随它们的国家真诚地希望结束朝鲜战争，但是他又说，目前很难看出朝鲜有早日实现和平的希望，这样他自己就驳倒了他所说的话。
    艾登企图掩饰美英集团在朝鲜问题上的侵略政策，这种企图只能证明英国政府意欲支持美国扩大远东战争的计划。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯接着发言（全文见另电）。
    美国代表洛奇发言，重复诬蔑中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和苏联的谰言。而这些诽谤谰言早就被苏联代表团揭穿了。洛奇在他的演说中，用很大一部分时间故意歪曲苏联代表团关于朝鲜问题的态度。洛奇用这种办法逃避了要他答复的问题：为什么美国统治集团反对解决朝鲜问题？为什么美国统治集团不同意在朝鲜停火？
    波兰代表斯克热歇夫斯基发言说，本届联合国大会本可以在苏联建议的基础上采取措施立刻和完全结束朝鲜战争，而为和平解决整个朝鲜问题奠定基础。但是，美英集团代表拒绝接受苏联建议。波兰代表团支持苏联所提出的撤销所谓“朝鲜统一复兴委员会”的提案。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表也支持苏联的提案，他指出所谓“朝鲜统一复兴委员会”实际上已经成为朝鲜美军司令部的附属品。
    乌克兰共和国代表巴拉诺夫斯基在发言中指出，美国对朝鲜问题的态度不仅证明它显然不愿意结束它所发动的侵略战争，而且暴露了它公然要进一步扩大朝鲜战争的企图。乌克兰代表并抨击大会前半期会议所通过的欺骗世界舆论的决议，指出这个决议的目的是掩饰美国统治集团继续以战俘问题当作延长朝鲜战争的借口的行为，掩饰美国侵略者阻止朝中战俘回家并秘密把他们移交给李承晚和蒋介石的军队的行为。巴拉诺夫斯基最后表示支持苏联提案。
    继起发言的白俄罗斯共和国代表基谢列夫斥责美国垄断资本家为了获得巨额利润，而处心积虑地破坏板门店停战谈判，延长朝鲜战争。他也支持苏联提案。
    五个代表团（苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯、乌克兰与波兰）投票赞成苏联提出的撤销所谓联合国“朝鲜统一复兴委员会”的提案。主张保留联合国“朝鲜统一复兴委员会”的提案以多数票获得通过。苏联、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰与波兰投票反对这个提案。
    至此，大会结束了关于朝鲜问题的讨论。讨论令人信服地说明了：联合国中以美国为首的集团继续反对和平解决朝鲜问题。
