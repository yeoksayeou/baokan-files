Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: People from all walks of life in the capital city of Beijing and Tianjin are enthusiastically supporting the promulgation of the Election Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and local People's Congresses at all levels.

Workers from factories and enterprises such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Central Nationalities Printing Factory, and the Beijing Tram Company, as well as transportation workers and construction workers in the capital, have expressed their boundless enthusiasm in support of the promulgation of the Election Law. Li Youzhi, a Beijing model worker and worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said excitedly after seeing the Election Law: "I have nothing else to say, only to use practical actions to improve production to support Chairman Mao's Election Law."

Professors from various universities in Beijing also support this Election Law. Qian Duansheng, President of the Beijing College of Political Science and Law, said: "This Election Law is completely suitable for China's situation and can meet the demands of the people of the whole country. The implementation of this Election Law will enable our country's economic construction to proceed more smoothly. We will contribute our strength with unparalleled enthusiasm to the implementation of the Election Law!" Meng Zhaoying, Director of the Radio Department of Tsinghua University, Zhang Guangdou, Professor of the Water Conservancy Department, and Wu Chi, Professor of the Petroleum Department, also unanimously agreed that the Election Law promulgated by the Central People's Government is democratic and practical.

Students from more than 40 ethnic minorities studying at the Central Nationalities Institute were even more jubilant after seeing the Election Law. Huang Yu, a Yao student, said that he would write more letters back to explain the Election Law to his Yao compatriots. He said: I believe that from now on, the relationship between all ethnic groups in the country and between the people of all ethnic groups and the government will become closer. Wang Wenying, a Li student, said excitedly: In the future, when I see representatives of the Li ethnic group coming to the capital to attend the National People's Congress, I will not be able to describe how excited I will be. Ahongs from 50 mosques in Beijing and students from the Beijing Ethnic Minorities Training Class also held meetings to express their full support for the promulgation of the Election Law.

Overseas Chinese residing in Beijing were particularly excited after seeing the promulgation of the Election Law. Zheng Shaoxian, an overseas Chinese student who returned from Indonesia, said excitedly: "In the past, our lives and property were not protected abroad. After the liberation of the motherland, the People's Government has taken care of and protected us in all aspects, and we have felt the warmth of the motherland for the first time. Now we can enjoy political rights that we never dreamed of before; I cannot imagine how moved and excited I will be when I receive a ballot for the first time in my life!" Overseas Chinese students from Hebei Beijing Middle School and Beijing No. 8 Middle School held symposiums after the promulgation of the Election Law. Everyone expressed their enthusiastic support for the Election Law at the meeting.

People from all walks of life in Tianjin also enthusiastically support the Election Law of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and the local People's Congresses at all levels. Pan Changyou, a national industrial labor model, said: The promulgation and implementation of the Election Law is a major event in the political life of the Chinese people. The Chinese people can elect the people they are satisfied with and respect as representatives and members of the People's Government to manage national affairs. This makes us workers particularly happy! Before liberation, we workers had no political status at all, let alone the right to vote. After liberation, the working class became the masters of the country, and many workers participated in people's representative conferences at all levels, and some were elected as members of the government. Before the National and local People's Congresses are convened, we workers must greet this general election with enthusiasm for active production and prepare to carefully elect our own worker representatives.

The industrial and commercial circles and medical circles in Tianjin also enthusiastically support the Election Law. Zhu Jisheng, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce and General Manager of the private Renli Company, said: This Election Law is the victorious fruit of the Chinese people's long-term arduous struggle, bloodshed and sacrifice. Its content and spirit are not only universal and democratic, but also combine the current specific situation and actual life. Our industrial and commercial circles must participate in this election and its preparatory work with a serious attitude. Zhu Xianyi, President of Tianjin Medical College, said: Since the May Fourth Movement, our Chinese people have demanded democracy, but it was impossible to realize it under the reactionary rule. During the Kuomintang rule, the ugly farce of electing a pseudo-National Congress was staged, and the broad masses of the people expressed their extreme disgust at the Kuomintang's scams. Only three years after the national liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, a truly democratic general election will soon be implemented, and our many years of expectation will be realized. We medical personnel sincerely support this Election Law and will definitely participate enthusiastically in the upcoming general election.

    北京和天津人民热烈拥护选举法
    【新华社三日讯】首都和天津各界人民热烈拥护中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法的公布。
    石景山钢铁厂、中央民族印刷厂、北京市电车公司等工厂企业的工人和首都运输工人、建筑工人，以无比的热情拥护选举法的公布。北京市劳动模范、石景山钢铁厂工人李友芝，看到选举法后兴奋地说：“我没有别的话说，只有用提高生产的实际行动，来拥护毛主席的选举法。”
    北京各大学的教授们，也都拥护这一选举法。北京政法学院院长钱端升说：“这一选举法完全适合中国情况，可以满足全国人民的要求。实行这一选举法，可以使我们国家的经济建设更加顺利地进行。我们将以无比的热诚为实行选举法而贡献出力量！”清华大学无线电系主任孟昭英、水利系教授张光斗、石油系教授吴迟，也一致认为中央人民政府颁布的选举法是民主的、切实可行的。
    在中央民族学院学习的四十多个少数民族的学生们，看到选举法后，更是欢欣鼓舞，瑶族黄钰表示要多多写信回去向瑶族同胞解释选举法，他说：我相信，从此以后全国各民族之间以及各族人民与政府的联系会更加紧密起来。黎族王文映激动地说：将来当我看到黎族代表来首都出席全国人民代表大会时，我将无法形容我的心情是如何的激动。北京市五十个清真寺的阿訇和北京市少数民族训练班的学员也召开会议，表示完全拥护选举法的公布。
    居住在北京的归国华侨看到选举法公布后，特别感到兴奋。从印尼归国的华侨学生郑少先激动地说：“从前我们在国外生命财产都受不到保护，祖国解放后，人民政府在各方面对我们照顾和保护，我们才第一次感到祖国的温暖，现在我们又能享受到从前梦想不到的政治权利；我不能预想，当我有生以来第一次拿到一张选票时，我将会多么感动和兴奋！”河北北京中学、北京市第八中学的华侨学生，在选举法颁布后，都召开了座谈会。会上大家都表示热烈拥护选举法。
    天津市各界人民也热烈拥护中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法。全国工业劳动模范潘长有说：选举法的公布施行，是中国人民政治生活中的一件重大事情，中国人民可以选举自己满意的、敬爱的人作代表和人民政府的委员，来管理国家大事。这使我们工人特别高兴！解放前我们工人根本没有政治地位，更谈不到选举权了。解放后，工人阶级当家作了主人，很多工人参加了各界人民代表会议，有的并当选了政府委员。在全国及地方各级人民代表大会召开以前，我们工人一定要以积极生产的热情迎接这次普选，并准备慎重地选举出我们工人自己的代表。
    天津市的工商界和医务界也热烈拥护选举法。天津市工商业联合会副主任委员、私营仁立公司总经理朱继圣说：这个选举法是中国人民经过长期坚苦斗争、流血牺牲所获得的胜利果实。它的内容和精神不仅是普遍、民主，而且是结合目前具体情况和实际生活的。我们工商界必须以认真严肃的态度来参加这次选举及其准备工作。天津医学院院长朱宪彝说：我们中国人民从五四运动以来，就提出要求民主，但在反动统治时代，根本不可能实现。国民党统治时期曾扮演过选举伪国大的丑剧，广大人民对国民党的骗局表示十分厌恶。全国解放后仅仅三年多，在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，很快就要实行真正民主的普选了，我们多年的期望就要实现了。我们医务界人士，衷心拥护这个选举法，一定热烈参加即将到来的普选。
