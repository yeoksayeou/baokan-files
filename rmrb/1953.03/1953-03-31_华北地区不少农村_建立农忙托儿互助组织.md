Many rural areas in North China have gradually established mutual aid childcare organizations for the busy farming season, along with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. As early as 1949, some agricultural production mutual aid teams spontaneously formed mutual aid childcare groups during the busy farming season. In the past two years, due to the widespread development of the patriotic production increase campaign, mutual aid childcare organizations have also seen further development. There are currently more than 25,000 mutual aid childcare organizations in the entire region, caring for over 130,000 children, helping more than 110,000 mothers to get rid of the burden of childcare and fully participate in production. In Hebei Province, mutual aid childcare organizations are found in 128 counties. According to statistics from 122 counties alone, there are more than 18,000 groups, an increase of more than five times compared to 1951; over 80,000 children are cared for, an increase of eight times compared to 1951, enabling more than 59,000 mothers to free up time to participate in field labor. In the autumn of 1952, Suiyuan Province also organized more than 1,500 "child-watching groups," allowing more than 30,000 women to participate in production with peace of mind.

The mutual aid childcare organizations in North China generally have health systems in place to ensure the health of the children in their care and pay attention to cultivating good living habits. Therefore, the mothers of the children in care are very relieved. Many farm-busy nurseries, in addition to stipulating that children wash their faces regularly every day and change their clothes regularly, also conduct physical examinations for the children every half month with the help of the village medical and health cooperatives. If there is any illness, it can be treated in time. Many mutual aid childcare organizations also often pay attention to cultivating children's habits of collective life. The children love the nurseries very much and happily go to the nurseries every day after breakfast.

According to different conditions in various places, mutual aid childcare organizations in North China have the following forms: The first type is a more fixed farm-busy nursery, with a fixed address and nannies, and has established learning, health, and other systems. For example, the nursery in Xigu Village, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, has a sanitary room specially decorated for children, as well as various toys. This type of nursery can generally only be established in villages where agricultural production cooperatives are well-established. The second type is a semi-mobile small childcare group. This type of childcare organization is established when farm work is particularly tight, and the location is not fixed. Some are concentrated in the nanny's home, and some take the children to play in a shady place, bringing their own toys. The third type is a temporary childcare group formed to cope with surprise tasks. For example, when Yitong Village, Yuxiang County, Shanxi Province, was carrying out an aphid extermination campaign, it organized a temporary childcare group, with one woman taking care of twelve children, concentrating the older ones under the trees to swing, and the younger ones playing gongs and drums, so that their mothers could participate in the aphid extermination struggle, thus ensuring the smooth completion of the aphid extermination task.

In order to further consolidate the mutual aid childcare organizations, many villages in North China have paid attention to strengthening the leadership of the mutual aid childcare organizations, forming leading bodies, strengthening ideological and health education for nannies, solving problems occurring in the mutual aid childcare organizations, and regularly inspecting its work.

### 华北地区不少农村  建立农忙托儿互助组织

    华北地区不少农村
    建立农忙托儿互助组织
    华北地区有不少农村随着互助合作运动的发展，逐步建立了农忙托儿互助组织。早在一九四九年，有若干农业生产互助组在农忙时自动成立了托儿互助组。近两年来，由于爱国增产竞赛运动的广泛开展，托儿互助组织也有了进一步的发展。全区现有托儿互助组织两万五千多处，受托的幼儿达十三万以上，帮助十一万多个母亲摆脱了幼儿的拖累能全力参加生产。河北省托儿互助组织遍及一百二十八县，仅据一百二十二县的统计，就有一万八千多个组，比一九五一年增加了五倍多；受托幼儿八万多个，较一九五一年增加了八倍，使五万九千多个母亲能够腾出时间参加田间劳动。绥远省在一九五二年秋季，也已组织了一千五百多个“看娃娃组”，使三万多妇女安心参加生产。
    华北地区农忙托儿互助组织，对受托儿童一般都订有保证健康的卫生制度，并注意培养他们有良好的生活习惯，因此，受托儿童的母亲们都很放心。有不少农忙托儿所除规定了孩子在所内每天定时洗脸和定期换洗衣服外，并在村医疗卫生合作社的帮助下，每半月给孩子们检查一次身体，有疾病时，可以及时得到治疗。不少托儿互助组织还经常注意培养孩子们集体生活的习惯。孩子们对托儿所很喜爱，每天吃过早饭，都高兴地到托儿所去。
    根据各地不同的条件，华北地区托儿互助组织有下面几种形式：第一种是较定型的农忙托儿所，有固定的地址和褓姆，并建立了学习、卫生等制度。如山西屯留县西故村的托儿所，有专为孩子们布置的卫生室，还有各种玩具。这类托儿所一般是在农业生产合作社较有基础的村才能建立。第二种是半流动的小型托儿组。这类托儿组织在农事特别紧张时成立，地点是不固定的，有的是集中在褓姆家里，有的把孩子带到荫凉的地方玩，玩具自带。第三种是为应付突击任务而临时组成的托儿组。如山西省虞乡县义合同村在进行灭蚜运动时，组织了一个临时托儿组，由一个妇女看管着十二个孩子，将较大的集中到树下打秋千，较小的玩锣鼓等，使他们的母亲能去参加灭蚜的斗争，因而保证了灭蚜任务的顺利完成。
    为了进一步巩固托儿互助组织，华北区有不少村已注意了加强对托儿互助组织的领导，组成了领导机构，加强对褓姆的思想教育和卫生教育，解决托儿互助组织中发生的问题，并定期检查它的工作。（新华社）
