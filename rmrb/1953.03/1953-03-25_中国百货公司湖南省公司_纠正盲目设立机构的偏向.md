China Department Store Hunan Provincial Company
Corrects the Tendency to Blindly Establish Institutions
    The China Department Store Hunan Provincial Company recently decided to abolish the Shaoyang and Changde Department Store Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Stations, correcting the tendency to blindly establish institutions.
    In November last year, the China Department Store Hunan Provincial Company established four department store purchasing and supply wholesale stations in Changsha, Hengyang, Changde, and Shaoyang. When preparing to build the stations, the leadership of the China Department Store Hunan Provincial Company did not build stations based on economic regionalization and business needs. According to the natural flow of commodities, the Shaoyang area could be entirely supplied by the Hengyang Department Store Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station. Establishing a wholesale business institution in Shaoyang increased the intermediate warehousing links and unnecessary packaging, disassembly, and handling costs, increasing the cost of goods. As a result, department stores, cooperatives, and private merchants in the Shaoyang supply area were unwilling to buy goods from the Shaoyang wholesale station. The Changde Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station also faced the same situation because transportation by land and water to Changsha from the Changde supply area was convenient and inexpensive, and the department stores and cooperatives rarely purchased goods from Changde. In this situation, the cadres of the Changde Department Store Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station, seeing that the task could not be completed, had no choice but to change from wholesale to retail, carrying goods to various primary markets and organizations to promote sales, competing with department stores and cooperatives. This not only wasted funds and manpower, but also failed to do a good job in supply. The China Department Store Hunan Provincial Company has now decided to abolish the Shaoyang and Changde Department Store Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Stations. The business in the original Shaoyang supply area is assigned to the Hengyang Wholesale Station for supply, and the Changde area is assigned to the Changsha Wholesale Station for supply.

    中国百货公司湖南省公司
    纠正盲目设立机构的偏向
    中国百货公司湖南省公司最近决定撤销邵阳和常德两个百货采购供应批发站，纠正了盲目设立机构的偏向。
    中国百货公司湖南省公司去年十一月在长沙、衡阳、常德、邵阳等地建立了四个百货采购供应批发站。在筹备建站时，中国百货公司湖南省公司的领导方面没有根据经济区划和业务需要建站。按照商品的自然流转规律，邵阳地区完全可以由衡阳百货采购供应批发站供应。在邵阳设立批发业务机构，便增加了中间仓库环节和不必要的包装、拆卸、搬运等费用，增加了商品的成本。结果，邵阳供应区内的百货商店、合作社和私商都不愿到邵阳批发站来买货。常德采购供应批发站也存在同样情况，因为常德供应区到长沙进货水陆交通方便，费用低廉，各百货商店和合作社也很少到常德进货。在这种情况下，常德百货采购供应批发站的干部看到任务完不成了，只好变批发为零售，挑着货物到各初级市场和机关团体去推销，与各百货商店和合作社互相竞销。这样，不但浪费了资金、人力，同时也不能做好供应工作。中国百货公司湖南省公司现在已决定撤销邵阳、常德两个百货采购供应批发站。原邵阳供应地区业务划归衡阳批发站供应，常德地区划归长沙批发站供应。　（新华社）
