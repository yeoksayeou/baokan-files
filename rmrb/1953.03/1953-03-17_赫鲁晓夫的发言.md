Comrades! On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the joint plenary session of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and the representatives of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities from Moscow, Leningrad, and Ukraine, I submit the following proposal regarding the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for discussion by the joint session of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    In view of the resolution of the joint plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, suggesting that Comrade Nikolai Mikhailovich Shvernik assume the position of Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, I propose relieving Comrade Shvernik of his duties as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    At the same time, I propose electing Comrade Nikolai Mikhailovich Shvernik as a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    Comrades, I propose electing Comrade Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. (Prolonged applause)

    Our Party and all the Soviet people know that Comrade Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov is a loyal student of the great Lenin, a faithful comrade-in-arms of the great Stalin, and a tireless fighter for the cause of our Communist Party and for the victory of Communism in our country.

    We all believe that Comrade Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov will gloriously fulfill the tasks of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for the welfare of the Soviet people.

    The resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the election of Comrade Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will surely receive the full support and agreement of all the people of our great Soviet Union. (Stormy and prolonged applause, all rise)
