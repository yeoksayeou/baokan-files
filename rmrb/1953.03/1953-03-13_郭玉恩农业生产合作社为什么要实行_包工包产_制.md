Why the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative Implemented the "Contract Work and Output" System

By our reporter Lan Cun

"It was simply a chaotic mess"

The Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, was organized on the basis of two mutual aid teams (eighteen households). When the cooperative was first established, the members discussed issues such as land shares and profit distribution thoroughly, but they didn't give enough thought to how labor should be organized. At the time, everyone lacked experience in running a cooperative and didn't realize the significant difference between collective labor after land was changed from individual to collective management, and collective labor during the mutual aid team period. In mutual aid teams, each household planned its own production, and everyone knew what work to do each day. It was easy to see who was good, who was bad, who was losing out, and who was gaining. After the establishment of the cooperative, everyone was unsure of the overall production plan and what they were supposed to do each day. Under these circumstances, due to the different levels of ideological awareness among the members, various labor attitudes inevitably arose. To make each member as active and motivated as if they were working on their own land, in addition to strengthening collectivist ideological education and production planning, a more scientific and rational labor organization system than the mutual aid team was necessary. The Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative did not foresee these changes at the time and therefore did not consider how to establish necessary labor regulations. The cooperative was established in the spring plowing season of 1951, and all work was arranged by the cooperative chairman alone. Guo Yu'en recalled the situation at the time, saying, "It was simply a chaotic mess." Every day, the eighteen laborers from eighteen households would gather in front of the cooperative chairman's door after breakfast, waiting to be assigned work. One would ask, "What do I do?" another would ask, "What do I work on?" The chairman would assign work one by one. When assigning work, one would say, "It's not suitable for me to do that," and another would say, "That piece of land is too far for me." By the time the work was assigned, the sun was already high in the sky. After doing this for a few days, the chairman felt that this was not a solution; many members also said, "Doing this not only doesn't save labor compared to the mutual aid team, but it also wastes labor." But at the time, the work was urgent, and the chairman, in addition to managing all the big and small affairs of the cooperative, also worked in the fields with everyone, and his mind was completely occupied, so he couldn't think of a way to improve things. Guo Yu'en had to get up early and go to bed late every day, thinking about how to do the work on the cooperative's two hundred acres of land and how to distribute the work to each person better and faster while eating and walking. During this period, he only slept three or four hours a night, and his eyes were bloodshot. Fortunately, the chairman was selfless, capable, and hardworking, and the members were also united. Most people were very active when working; at the same time, the cooperative was still relatively small, and the production content was relatively simple, so the spring plowing and planting work was completed on time. Although seven or eight fen of land were not plowed until just before planting because the chairman forgot when allocating work, they were still planted.

    After dividing into groups, the time to go to the fields was advanced

After the spring plowing was completed, everyone summarized the previous work and said that labor was wasted severely, and only eight-tenths of the work was done for every ten points of effort. Guo Yu'en thought to himself: If there were two more cadres, the work would be easier. So he proposed to divide the members into groups, each group selecting a group leader, and the group leader would assign the work each day, so that assigning work could be faster with fewer people. Everyone agreed to this idea. All the labor in the cooperative was divided into two groups according to the principle of voluntary association, and the land was roughly divided into two halves, with each group responsible for one half. At the same time, a vice chairman was elected to share some of the chairman's work. When dividing into groups, Guo Yu'en told everyone, "The land is all our land, and if one group has difficulties, the other group should help." Everyone agreed. When hoeing corn, they started to work in groups. The cooperative's life was still planned by the chairman, who first assigned work to the group leaders, who then assigned work to the group members. As a result, the time to go to the fields was advanced. But during hoeing, it was discovered that one group had more cornfields, and the other group had more millet fields. According to seasonal needs, corn should have been hoeed first. But the group with more corn couldn't hoe it all, and the group with more millet wanted to hoe millet and didn't want to help the other group hoe corn. "Mutual assistance" became empty words. After the chairman's persuasion and education, the two groups transferred labor to each other, hoeing corn first and then hoeing millet. After doing this for a while, more problems were discovered: Some of the land was hoeed terribly. The chairman criticized everyone, but no one admitted that they had hoeed badly.

    One group said that the second group had hoeed it badly, and the second group said that the first group had hoeed it. Because the two groups mixed together to work when transferring labor, the land was also mixed up, and there was no quality standard, so it was impossible to investigate responsibility. To solve this problem, the amounts of the main crops in the two groups were roughly adjusted. This is how they worked until the autumn harvest. This year, although the organization of labor was not scientific enough, because the cooperative's production content was still relatively simple, and collective labor was carried out regularly, with unified allocation of labor, it still saved labor compared to the mutual aid team. There was no feeling of a lack of labor at the time; on the contrary, eight man-days were left over.

    Even with more cadres, it still doesn't work without a system

In the spring of 1952, the cooperative expanded from eighteen households to forty-six households. To ensure continued improvement in agricultural output and to solve the problem of surplus labor (no sideline production avenues could be found this year), the cooperative decided to repair the beach and flood the land, open canals for irrigation, and build dams to protect the beach. After calculating the work, there was not only no surplus labor, but there was also a shortage. Everyone said, "We need to organize properly." But everyone still thought that electing a few more cadres and dividing into more groups would be enough, and they hadn't considered further establishing a system. So the cooperative elected another vice chairman and three group leaders. All the labor in the cooperative was still divided into five groups according to the principle of voluntary association, and the land was also divided into five plots according to the amount of labor in each group, with each group responsible for one plot. After working like this, the following phenomenon was discovered: Some groups went to the fields early every morning, and some groups hadn't left yet. Guo Yinzi's group often went to the fields late. The groups that went to the fields early complained, "Who can stand to be taken advantage of like this?" So the method of beating the gong to go to the fields together and beating the gong to come down from the fields together was implemented. After doing this for a few days, it seemed okay on the surface, but the problem wasn't solved. Because at this time, there were more members, and the thinking was more complex. Although everyone in each group went to the fields at the same time, some people moved slowly and didn't work hard when they got to the fields, and when the gong was struck to stop work, there was originally not much work left, which could have been finished quickly, but they would leave it and rush back, and these people still recorded ten points of work (before the cooperative implemented the contract system, the cooperative members' work was calculated using a fixed score and live evaluation method). If it were working in a mutual aid team, people like this would have been deducted points by the landowner long ago, but now many people were unhappy in their hearts but didn't say anything. Some group leaders thought that since the land had been shared, backsliding was backsliding on the cooperative's work, not on any one household's, so they started to be lenient. This led to some people who were originally active in labor becoming passive. They said:

    "It's ten points for working hard, and it's ten points for not working hard, so it's better to rest a bit." Sometimes people who were active in labor couldn't bear it anymore and would argue with those who weren't active. To solve this problem, Guo Yu'en led everyone to a meeting to check: Who exactly is backsliding? But no one was willing to admit it. Everyone argued for a long time without any result. Just at this time, the Pingshun County Committee of the Communist Party of China was studying the production organization of agricultural production cooperatives and called on each cooperative to try out the contract system. Everyone said, "The problem can't be solved without implementing the contract system." But how to contract? At first, no one could think of a complete method. Everyone said, "Let's implement it while modifying it."

    Implementing the four-determination contract work system, someone did twelve points of work in the time of four points of work

When weeding seedlings, the "four-determination contract work" system was implemented. Initially, only "determination of work" and "determination of quantity" were implemented. Determination of work meant first evaluating the number of workdays required per mu based on the distance, quality of the land, and different crops. Then, the work was contracted to each group according to the amount and strength of each group's labor. The number of mu contracted by each group was considered the "determination of quantity." Everyone agreed that if the original number of workdays was reduced due to high labor efficiency, or if the original number of workdays was exceeded due to low labor efficiency, work should still be recorded according to the original number of workdays. After doing this for two days, group leader Guo Dejiao complained to the cooperative chairman, "Everyone is just rushing to work, and the hoeing that should be deep is shallow, is this okay?" The chairman felt that his opinion was very good and called everyone together for discussion again, stipulating the cultivation standards for each crop, and implementing "determination of quality." Later, it was discovered that when distributing land to each group, only the amount of workdays was emphasized, and the main crops were not appropriately separated, so that some groups had thirty mu of corn, while others had only fifteen mu, and it was impossible to complete the urgent work of the current season. At this time, past experience was applied again, and the number of mu of the main crops was roughly the same as the standard, and the land of each group was redistributed. It was also stipulated that the cooperative would require what work to be completed and when, and everyone had to complete it on time. This is when the "determination of time" was truly implemented.

    Since the implementation of the "four-determination contract work" system, the enthusiasm of the members for labor has greatly increased. In the past, Guo Laisun from Guo Jinguiju's group would not go to the fields unless the group leader urged him, and when he got to the fields, he would "endure the sun" and wait for the gong to go home; now he urges the group leader to go to the fields every day. He did twelve points of work in the time of four points of work. The members who were originally active in labor became even more active. The fifty-one mu and seven fen of corn responsible by Guo Haibei's group were originally planned to be hoeed in eighty-three workdays, but it was completed in only sixty-one workdays. In the past, group leaders and group members were lenient with each other, but now they supervise each other, and criticism and self-criticism are carried out within the group. Guo Yunkao never wanted to learn technology, and his work was very rough, and everyone criticized him and deducted two points of work from him. In this way, those who didn't learn technology paid attention to studying technology. The leadership of the group leaders has also been strengthened. In the past, the daily work plan, inspection, and supervision all relied on the cooperative chairman, but now the group leaders actively arrange the life of the group. After the implementation of the "four-determination contract work" system, labor competition naturally unfolded between the groups. After the competition started, it was discovered that groups combined on a voluntary basis were sometimes strong and sometimes weak, making it difficult to compete. Only then were the strong and weak, the technically skilled and unskilled, and the new and old members matched with each other, and the manpower of each group was redistributed. Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and propagandists were also appropriately adjusted in each group to facilitate leading the competition. The land of each group was also appropriately adjusted. In order to cooperate with the development of the competition and earnestly implement

    "four-determination contract work," an inspection team was also organized (one person was drawn from each group plus the three cooperative chairmen), which inspected the work every day and announced the work results of each group according to each agricultural stage. The good results were rewarded, and the bad ones were criticized. After this, the chairman's mind became clearer. The chairman was clear about when to complete what work and how much labor to use. This made it possible to better consider the cooperative's production and construction plans and arrange life more scientifically. Whether it was during the busy or slack season, as soon as there was surplus labor, it could be immediately transferred to agricultural infrastructure construction work such as repairing beaches. Before the autumn of this year, agricultural infrastructure construction used more than nine hundred workdays in total, and the productivity of the agricultural production cooperative was increasing.

    Only contracting work and not contracting output, everyone still doesn't care about output

But problems were discovered during the implementation of the "four-determination contract work" system. One day between July and August last year, it rained, and that night, mountain floods flowed down the two dry canals that had been repaired in the spring. When Guo Yu'en heard the sound of the water, he hurried to call the members to dig the river to irrigate the land, but he couldn't find anyone; he called from house to house, and everyone said they were asleep. It was difficult to get everyone up and temporarily assign them to divert water to irrigate the land. After this incident, Guo Yu'en had doubts in his mind, and he thought, "We spent three hundred and fifty workdays opening two dry canals, just to divert floodwater to irrigate the land. The canals are repaired, and the water has come, but the canals are still canals, and the land is still land, and everyone doesn't care about irrigating the land, what is the reason?" Two days later, Guo Dejiao told Guo Yu'en, "Why is that piece of millet on Beiguai so yellow?" The inspection result was that it had been eaten by corn borers. This piece of land was responsible by Guo Jinguiju's group, and they didn't care about it. Later, there was another rain, and after the rain, Guo Yu'en walked around the Dashiwangou ditch and found that the dikes of the terraced fields had been washed away in four places by the flood, and the field heads had also been flooded, but no one cared. This piece of land originally belonged to Guo Huaiyou, and if the land hadn't been put into the cooperative, he would have repaired it long ago. After this series of facts, Guo Yu'en found that it was not enough to only implement the contract work system without implementing the contract output system, everyone completed the work, and the responsibility was over, and they would not go to protect the crops and care about output. At this time, the Shen Dongyu Agricultural Production Cooperative in the same village had decided to merge with Guo Yu'en's cooperative, and a mutual aid team had also decided to join the cooperative, and Guo Yu'en's cooperative would soon expand to seventy-six households. Guo Yu'en thought that the cooperative would be even larger in the future and scattered in three natural villages. If there was no contract output, the grain harvested in the autumn would have to be concentrated and then distributed, and transporting it back and forth alone would cost a lot of manpower and animal power, and the production content would be more complicated, and the leadership would not be able to take care of it. So he criticized everyone for not caring enough about the collective interests and proposed the idea of implementing the contract output system. After the autumn harvest last year, under Guo Yu'en's proposal, all the members agreed to implement the contract output system from 1953, that is, to develop the original four-determination contract work into the "four-determination contract output" system of determining quality, work, time, and output, also called the "contract work and output" system.

    After implementing the "contract work and output" system, management work must be more planned and scientific

The problem of contracting output is much more complicated than the problem of contracting work. Everyone brewed for a long time and then discussed together for several days before initially determining a set of methods. In the discussion, the first problem encountered was that production plans in the past were not very accurate, and both setting the output too low or too high would cause problems. Therefore, when evaluating the output of each piece of land, they tried their best to estimate all kinds of yield-increasing conditions: On the one hand, they had to consider the geological quality of each piece of land, what crops to plant, the output in previous years, how much manure to apply, the quality of the manure, and other conditions; on the other hand, they had to consider the number of plowing and weeding times required for each piece of land and each crop, the quality of plowing and weeding, and other cultivation standards. Combining these two aspects, they came to the output of each piece of land. Everyone also considered that the strength of draft animals and the quality of farm tools would also affect output, and the solution was to appropriately adjust the livestock and farm tools of each group. After the output was determined, the next step was how to contract. To avoid the phenomenon of everyone wanting to earn more workdays and deliberately lowering the output or being picky, they adopted the method of evaluating together with all the land in the cooperative as a unit. After everyone unanimously agreed on the output of each piece of land, they contracted a certain output and a certain number of workdays to each group. When contracting to each group, there were the following regulations: First, each group must carry out cultivation according to the work, time, and quality requirements stipulated by the cooperative. Because only by achieving the determination of work, quality, and time can the output required by the cooperative be achieved. Second, the output completed by each group under contract will be issued work tickets according to the number of workdays; when the original output is exceeded, the cooperative and the group will share the excess part at a ratio of four to six. The group gets 60%, which is divided according to the amount of labor days done by each person in the group; the cooperative gets 40%, which is used as a public accumulation fund. If the output is not reached, the contract group is responsible for compensating for the reduced output, and the amount of compensation is determined based on the specific situation. Third, the group is not responsible for compensating for output reduction due to disasters. If the entire cooperative generally reduces output due to disasters, and a certain group does not reduce output due to active fighting against the disaster, then the part that has not been reduced will still be shared according to the four-six profit-sharing method. If losses are caused due to the cooperative's untimely supply of seeds and fertilizers to the group, the group is not responsible for compensation. The allocation of land to each group as much as possible took into account the living conditions of the members. The last problem was how to calculate work for each member in the group. Everyone decided to still adopt the original four-determination contract work method within the group, calculating work according to the work and evaluating and recording it daily. Each group would set up an accountant (actually a work recorder) to be responsible for issuing work tickets. The problem of implementing the "contract work and output" system was basically solved in this way.

    After implementing the "contract work and output" system, the members' sense of responsibility and initiative have been greatly enhanced, and everyone is calculating how to grow their group's land well. But Guo Yu'en has estimated that many problems will still occur during the implementation process: For example, in the future, if it rains, problems will occur if there is rain on this side of the land but no rain on the other side (this phenomenon often occurs in mountainous areas); when the river water comes down, problems will occur if the land upstream is irrigated but the land downstream is not; when distributing manure, everyone will compete for good manure, and so on. To solve these problems, all kinds of work in the cooperative need to be more planned and scientific; implement centralized leadership and strengthen collectivist ideological education. Therefore, since the autumn of last year, the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative has established various necessary organizations and systems and is preparing to implement an economic accounting system to strengthen the planning of the cooperative's management work.

    郭玉恩农业生产合作社为什么要实行“包工包产”制
    本报记者　蓝邨
    “简直是乱轰轰的一伙伙”
    山西省平顺县郭玉恩农业生产合作社是在两个互助组（十八户）的基础上组织起来的。在开始建社的时候，社员们对土地入股、分红等问题讨论得很透彻，但对劳动力应该怎样组织的问题却考虑得不够。当时大家对办社都没有经验，认识不到土地由个体经营变成集体经营以后，这时的集体劳动和互助组时的集体劳动的重大区别。在互助组时，各家的生产由各家计划，每天做什么活，自己都知道。干起活来，谁好谁坏、谁吃亏谁沾光都容易看出来。成立合作社以后，每个人对全社的生产计划和每天自己应做什么活都摸不着底了。在这种情况下，由于各个社员思想觉悟程度的不一样，必然会产生各种不同的劳动态度。为了使每个社员都像在自己的土地上劳动一样的积极主动，除了加强集体主义的思想教育和生产计划性以外，还必须有一个比互助组更加科学合理的组织劳动力的制度。郭玉恩农业生产合作社当时预见不到这些变化，因而没有考虑怎样建立必要的劳动制度的问题。这个合作社在一九五一年春耕农忙季节成立，当时一切工作都靠社长一人来安排。郭玉恩回想起当时的情景说：“简直是乱轰轰的一伙伙。”每天十八户社员的十八个劳动力，一吃罢早饭就都拥到了社长的门前，等候分配工作。这个问“我干啥”？那个问
    “我弄什么”？社长就一个一个地来分配。分配工作的时候，不是这个说“我弄那不合适”，就是那个说“我去那块地太远啦”。每天等工作分配好了，太阳也出来好高了。这样做了几天，社长觉得不是个办法；不少的社员也说：“咱这样做，不仅不比互助组省工，还要浪费工呢。”但当时活很紧，社长每天除了要经管社内一切大小事情而外，也同大家一起下地劳动，脑子里没有一点空，一时想不出改善的办法。郭玉恩只好每天起早歇晚，吃饭、走路都在想着全社二百来亩地的活应该怎样做，每人的工作怎样才能分配得好些、快些。这个期间，他一夜只睡三、四个钟头的觉，两眼都熬红了。好在社长是个大公无私、精明强干的社长，社员们也很齐心。大多数人做起活来都很积极；同时，社也还比较小，生产内容比较简单，所以春耕播种的工作还是按时完成了。虽然有七、八分地岸因社长分配工作时忘记了，临到播种时还没有刨，但仍然种上了。
      分了组，上地的时间提早了
    春耕结束后总结前段工作，大家都说工浪费得厉害，每天当做十分的只做了八分。郭玉恩心里想：要是多有两个干部，工作就会好做一些。于是他提议把社员分成小组，每组选上个组长，每天的工作由组长分配，那样人少了分配工作可以快一些。大家都同意这个意见。全社劳力便按自愿结合的原则分成两个组，地也大体分成两半，一组负责一半。同时又选了个副社长，分担社长的一部分工作。分组时，郭玉恩告诉大家说：“地都是咱们的地，那组有了困难要互相支援。”大家也同意。锄玉茭的时候，开始分组干活。全社的生活仍然由社长计划，社长先向组长分配，组长再向组员分配。于是大家上地的时间就提早了。但在锄地当中，发现一个组的玉茭地多，另一个组的谷子地多。按季节需要，本该先锄玉茭。但玉茭多的这组锄不过来，而谷多的那组要锄谷，不愿去帮助这组锄玉茭。“互相支援”成了空话。经过社长的说服教育，两组才互相拨工，先锄玉茭然后锄谷。这样干了一段以后，又发现了问题：有些地锄得实在不像话。社长对大家提出了批评，但谁都不承认是自己锄得不好，
    一组的人说是二组锄坏了，二组的人说是一组锄的。因为互相拨工的时候两组人混在一起干活，把地也打乱了，又没有个质量标准，没法再追究责任。为了解决这个问题，才把两组的主要作物数量大体调剂了一下。就这样干到了秋收。这一年，劳动力的组织虽然还不够科学，但因为社的生产内容还比较简单，又是常年进行集体劳动，统一支配劳力，所以比互助组还是省工。当时没有感到劳力缺乏，相反的还剩余了八个人工。
      干部虽多，没有制度还是不行
    到了一九五二年春天，社由十八户扩大成了四十六户。为了保证继续提高农业产量和解决剩余劳力的问题（这一年找不到副业生产门路），社里决定要修滩漫地，开渠浇地，打坝护滩。算了算工，劳力不仅再没剩余，而且不够用了。大家说：“要好好组织组织才行啦。”但大家仍然以为多选几个干部，多分几个组就行了，还没有考虑到要进一步建立制度的问题。于是全社又选了一个副社长，三个小组长。全社劳力仍按自愿结合的原则组成五个组，地也按每组劳动力多少划成五片，每组负责一片。这样干起活来以后，发现了这种现象：每天早上，有的组早上地了，有的组还没走。郭银子组就常常迟上地。早上地的组提出意见：“谁能吃他这个亏？”于是实行了打锣一齐上地、打锣一齐下地的办法。这样做了几天，表面上看起来还好，实际上没有解决问题。因为这时社员多了，思想也复杂了。各组的人虽然都同时上了地，但有的人到了地里慢吞吞地不好好动弹，一到打锣歇工时，本来还有不多点活，一下子就可以干完的，也丢下急着回来了，这种人记工时仍然记了十分（该社在实行包工制以前对社员计工都是采用死分活评的办法）。要是在互助组作活，像这样的人早被地户提出扣分了，可是现在许多人心里虽然不高兴，嘴里就不说。有的组长认为现在土地入股了，背工是背了社的工，不是背那一户的，因此讲起情面来了。这样
    一来，有些本来劳动积极的人也消极了。他们说：
    “出力也是十分，不出力也是十分，不如歇着点吧。”有时劳动积极的人实在忍不住了，就和那些不积极的人争吵起来。为了解决这个问题，郭玉恩领导大家开会来检查：究竟是谁背工？但谁也不肯承认。大家争吵了半天也没得个结果。正好这时中共平顺县委员会正在研究农业生产合作社的生产组织问题，号召各社试行包工制。大家说：“非实行包工制不能解决问题。”但怎样包呢？一开始也想不出
    一套完整的办法。大家说：“一边实行，一边修改吧。”
    实行四定包工制，有人用四分工的时间做了十二分工的活
    锄苗的时候，开始实行了“四定包工”制。最初，只是实行了“定工”、“定量”。定工就是先按地的远近、好坏和不同的庄稼，评出每亩所需的工数。然后按各组劳动力的多少强弱分别包给各组。每组包了多少亩就算“定量”。大家议定：如果因劳动效率高按原定工数少用了工，或因劳动效率低多用了工，都应按原定工数记工。这样干了两天，组长郭德交向社长提意见说：“大家光为赶工了，该锄深的锄浅了，这样还行？”社长觉得他这意见很好，又召集大家讨论，规定了每种作物的耕作标准，实行了“定质”。以后，又发现把地分给各组时，只偏重工数多少，没有把主要作物适当分开，以致有的组有玉茭三十亩，有的组才有十五亩，不能按季节完成当前要紧的活。这时又应用过去的经验，以主要作物的亩数大体相差不多为标准，重新调剂了各组的地。并规定社要求什么时候完成什么活，大家都要按时完成。这才真正实行了“定时”。
    自从实行了“四定包工”制以后，社员的劳动积极性大大提高了。以前郭金桂组的郭来顺，总是组长不催就不上地，到了地里也是“熬日头”，盼着打锣回家；现在每天上地是他催组长了。他以四分工的时间做了过去十二分工的活。本来积极劳动的社员更加积极了。郭海北组负责的五十一亩七分玉茭，原订八十三个劳动日锄完，结果只用了六十一个劳动日就完成了。过去组长、组员之间互相讲情面，现在变成互相监督了，小组内展开了批评和自我批评。郭云考从来不愿学技术，作活很粗糙，大家对他提出了批评，并扣了他两分工。这样，不学技术的都注意研究技术了。小组长的领导也加强了。过去每天的工作计划、检查督促都靠社长，现在小组长主动地来安排小组的生活了。实行了“四定包工”制以后，各组之间自然而然地展开了劳动竞赛。在竞赛起来以后，发觉以自愿原则结合的组，有的强，有的弱，不好竞赛。这才把劳力强的弱的、技术高的低的、新社员老社员互相配搭开，重新调剂了各组的人力。党员、青年团员、宣传员也在各组作了适当调剂，便于领导竞赛。各组的地也作了适当调整。为了配合竞赛的开展和切实贯彻
    “四定包工”制，又组织了检查小组（各组抽一人加上三个社长），每天检查工作，按每一农事段落公布各组的工作成绩。成绩好的奖励，坏的批评。这以后，社长的头脑清醒起来了。什么时候完成什么活、用多少工，社长都清楚了。这就有可能更好地考虑全社的生产建设计划，更科学地安排生活了。不管在农忙或农闲时候，一有了剩余劳力就可以马上转到修滩等农业基本建设工作上去。这一年秋天以前，农业基本建设共用了九百多个工，农业生产合作社的生产力是越来越提高了。
    只包工不包产，大家还是不关心产量
    但在实行“四定包工”制当中又发现了问题。去年七、八月间有一天，下了一场雨，当天夜里，山洪顺着春季修好的两条旱渠流下来。郭玉恩听到水流声，赶忙去叫社员们扒河灌地，但一个人也找不见；挨家去叫，谁都说睡下了。好容易才把大家叫起来，临时分了工去引水灌地。这件事过了以后，郭玉恩脑子里发生了疑问，他想：“咱们费了三百五十个工开了两道旱渠，就是为了引洪水浇地。渠修好了，水也来了，但渠还是渠，地还是地，大家都不关心灌地的事，这是什么原故呢？”过了两天，郭德交告诉郭玉恩说：“北拐上那片谷子怎么那样黄？”检查结果，原来是被钻心虫吃坏了。这块地是郭金桂小组负责的，他们就没有管。后来又下了场雨，雨后郭玉恩到大石湾沟走了走，发现梯田的地岸被洪水冲塌了四处，地头也淹坏了，仍然没人管。这块地原来是郭怀有的，要是地还没有入社，他一定早就垒好了。经过这一连串的事实，郭玉恩发现仅只实行包工制而不实行包产还是不行，大家把工做完了，责任也就完了，不会再去爱护庄稼，关心产量。这时候，同村的申冬玉农业生产合作社已决定和郭玉恩社合并，有一个互助组也决定要参加社，郭玉恩社很快就要扩大到七十六户。郭玉恩想，以后社更大了，又分散在三个自然村，如不包产，秋天打下粮食都要集中起来才分配出去，光来回运输就要多费不少人力畜力，而且生产内容更复杂了，领导就更照顾不过来了。于是他一面批评大家对集体利益关心不够，一面提出实行包产制的意见。去年秋收以后，在郭玉恩的提议之下，全体社员都同意从一九五三年起实行包产，即把原来的四定包工发展成为定质、定工、定时、定产的“四定包产”制，也叫“包工包产”制。
    实行“包工包产”制，经营管理工作必须更加计划化、科学化
    包产的问题比包工的问题复杂得多。大家酝酿了好久，又集中讨论了好几天，才初步确定了一套办法。在讨论中，首先遇到的问题是过去订生产计划都不十分准确，而产量订低了或订高了都会发生问题。因此，在评定每块地的产量的时候，他们都尽可能地把各种增产条件都估计进去：一方面，要考虑每块地的地质好坏，种什么作物，历年产量多少，上粪多少，粪质好坏等条件；一方面，要考虑每块地、每种作物需要的耕锄遍数、耕锄质量等耕作标准。把这两方面的条件结合起来，才得出了每块地的产量。大家又考虑到耕畜强弱、农具好坏也会影响产量，解决的办法是各组的牲口农具都要作适当调剂。产量确定以后，跟着来的是怎样包的问题。为了避免大家想多挣工数而故意降低产量或挑肥拣瘦的现象，他们采取了以全社的土地为单位，大家在一起评定的办法。等到大家对每块地的产量都一致同意以后，才把一定的产量、一定的工数分包给各组。在分包给各组时，有这么几条规定：一、各组必须按照社所规定的工、时、质量要求去进行耕作。因为只有做到了定工、定质、定时，才能达到社所要求的产量。二、各组完成承包的产量，按工数发给工票；超过原订产量时，超产部分社和组按四、六的比例分红。组得六成，按组内各人所做的劳动日多少为比例分；社得四成，做为公积金。达不到产量的，减产部分由承包组负责包赔，赔偿多少看具体情况决定。三、因灾减产，组不负责包赔。如果全社普遍因灾减产，有某一组因积极和灾害斗争而没有减产，则没有减产的部分仍然按四六分红的办法分红。如因社对组供应种籽、肥料不及时而造成损失，组不负包赔责任。那片地包给那个组，都尽量照顾了组员的居住条件。最后的问题是组内每个组员如何计工的问题。大家决定在组内仍然采取原来的四定包工的办法，按活计工，逐日评记。各组都设一个会计（实际就是记工员），负责计发工票。实行“包工包产”制的问题，就这样基本解决了。
    实行“包工包产”制以后，社员的责任心和主动性大大增强了，谁都在盘算着要怎样才能把自己组的地种好。但郭玉恩已估计到在实行当中还会发生不少问题：比如，以后天下雨了，这边的地有雨那边的地没雨（山地常有此现象）会发生问题；河水下来了，上游的地浇到下游浇不到也会发生问题；在分粪的时候，谁也要争着要好粪等等。为了解决这些问题，全社的各种工作都需要更加计划化、科学化；实行集中领导，加强集体主义思想教育。因此，从去年秋天起，郭玉恩农业生产合作社已在建立了各种必要的机构和制度，准备实行经济核算制，以加强全社经营管理工作的计划性。
