The Shanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Culture and Education refused to hand over 16 billion yuan of surplus funds from the 1952 provincial culture and education expenses to the national treasury and instructed its subordinate units to spend all the surplus funds by the end of the year, seriously violating national financial discipline. At a meeting of the heads of the culture and education departments of various special districts in Shanxi Province on November 21, 1952, Feng Yi, the secretary of the Provincial Department of Culture and Education, personally instructed subordinate units to spend the surplus funds and instructed everyone to withdraw all the surplus funds from the People's Bank before December 20 to avoid freezing. After the meeting, various units immediately withdrew the funds and used them arbitrarily. The Department of Culture and Education withdrew 3 billion yuan and sent people to Shanghai to purchase physics and chemistry instruments. In addition to purchasing some goods on hand, they left 1.2 billion yuan in Shanghai to continue purchasing things. Various units bought things randomly without considering their needs, resulting in a large amount of stockpiling and waste of funds. The tables, benches, and stoves in Taiyuan Middle School were already sufficient, but they purchased another 100 long tables and 35 stoves, spending nearly 20 million yuan. Taigu Middle School also bought 150 sets of tables and benches that were not urgently needed, spending 21 million yuan. Linfen Normal School spent more than 40 million yuan to buy four sets of sofas and stored them in the warehouse, planning to use them after the office was built in the future. Some units even bought a lot of seasonal supplies. For example, Sanjin Middle School, Hongdong Middle School, Taiyuan Normal School, and Taiyuan Middle School all bought a large number of insecticides for summer use, such as 666 and DDT. These things may deteriorate or become ineffective over time.

Some school leaders, such as Wang Xi, the principal of Yuci Middle School, even put aside their teaching work to buy things in Taiyuan. The principal and a teacher from Xiaoyi Middle School ran to Beijing to purchase materials. They had no plan for purchasing things, and if they couldn't buy good things, they bought inferior ones, with the goal of "spending as much as possible." In order to spend the money, various schools adopted the method of ordering goods across the year. For example, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education ordered 500 million yuan worth of goods in Shanghai, which will not be delivered until May or June this year. The earliest delivery time for the delivery contracts signed by various middle schools in the Linfen Special District is February, and the latest is June. Some schools, although they signed contracts, deliberately stipulated them vaguely to avoid inspection by higher authorities; some simply did not sign contracts. Taigu County Agricultural College spent 4.56 million yuan to buy things from two private wood factories, Longshengyu and Sanyuansen. They issued delivery notes before the goods arrived and falsely reported the final accounts to the higher authorities.

There are even more serious phenomena. Hongdong Middle School, Hechang Middle School, Pingding Normal School, and other schools in the province, in order to avoid the bank freezing funds, violated cash management regulations and transferred the bank's surplus funds to the accounts of private merchants. Therefore, some people reflected, "Why are you public institutions still playing tricks on each other?"

The leading cadres of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education have serious departmentalism and lack a national concept. They held a special meeting to study ways to spend money in order to spend all the surplus money. This behavior is absolutely intolerable. It is hoped that the Shanxi Provincial People's Government will seriously deal with this incident and give appropriate punishment to the relevant personnel.

### 山西省人民政府文教厅违反国家财政纪律  指示所属单位任意化掉去年结余款项

    山西省人民政府文教厅违反国家财政纪律
    指示所属单位任意化掉去年结余款项
    山西省人民政府文教厅不肯把一九五二年全省文教费结余款一百六十亿元上缴国库，并指示所属单位在年底把结余款全部化光，严重地违反了国家财政纪律。在一九五二年十一月二十一日召开的山西各专署文教科长会议，省文教厅秘书主任冯毅亲自布置所属单位把结余款化完，并指示大家在十二月二十日以前把结余款全部从人民银行取出，以逃避冻结。会后，各单位当即分头取款，随意乱用。文教厅取款三十亿元，派人到上海采购理化仪器，除购回部分现货外，并把十二亿元留在上海，继续购买东西。各单位不根据需要乱买东西，造成了大量积压与浪费资金的现象。太原市中学的棹凳、火炉本已够用，但又购置长棹一百张、火炉三十五个，共用款近两千万元。太谷中学也买了并不急需的棹凳一百五十套，用款二千一百万元。临汾师范学校用款四千余万元买了四套沙发存在仓库里，准备将来盖起办公室后再用。有些单位甚至买了很多季节性很强的物资。如三晋中学、洪洞中学、太原师范和太原中学等校都买了大批夏天使用的杀虫药——六六六、滴滴涕等。而这些东西时间久了，是可能变坏或失效的。
    有些学校的负责人，如榆次中学校长王喜，竟放下教学工作，到太原购买东西。孝义中学校长、教员两人跑到北京市采购物资。他们购买东西并无计划，买不到好的就买次的，目的只是“尽量化光”而已。为了把钱化光，各学校采取了跨年度订货的办法。如山西省文教厅在上海订了五亿元的货，今年五、六月始能交货。临汾专区各中学校所订的交货合同，交货时间最早的是二月，最迟是六月。有的学校虽然订了合同，但为避免上级检查，竟故意规定得笼笼统统；有的干脆不订合同。太谷县农学院支款四百五十六万元，向私营隆盛玉、三元森两木厂买东西，货尚未到就开了发货票，向上级空报决算。
    还有更严重的现象。该省洪洞中学、贺昌中学、平定师范等学校为了逃避银行冻结资金，竟违反现金管理办法，将银行结余款转到私商的户头上。因此有的人反映说：“为什么你们公家和公家还搞鬼呢？”
    山西省文教厅领导干部有严重的本位主义作风，缺乏国家观念。他们为了把结余的钱全部化掉，召开了专门会议，研究化钱办法，这种行为是令人绝不能容忍的。希望山西省人民政府对这一事件进行严肃处理，对有关人员予以适当处分。
