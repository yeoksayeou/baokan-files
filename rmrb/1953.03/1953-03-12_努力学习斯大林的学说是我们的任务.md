    Striving to Study Stalin's Theories is Our Task
    (Speech at the memorial meeting for Comrade Stalin at the Marxist-Leninist Academy)
    Chen Boda
    In order to commemorate our great teacher, Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, Comrade Mao Zedong once instructed us to infinitely strengthen the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and to study Comrade Stalin's theories even more diligently.

    Obviously, intensifying the study of Comrade Stalin's theories is an even more special task for all comrades of the Marxist-Leninist Academy. If the comrades of the Marxist-Leninist Academy do not strive to study Comrade Stalin's theories well, or even better, then we would be failing our great teacher, Comrade Stalin, we would not be following Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, and we would not be worthy of being called students and workers of the Marxist-Leninist Academy.

    Comrade Stalin's theories represent the highest peak of current Marxist-Leninist development. Whether in Marxist philosophy, political economy, historical science, or in all aspects of the proletariat's strategy and tactics, Comrade Stalin has made very outstanding, brand new, major, and brilliant contributions. As Comrade Malenkov said: "Comrade Stalin is the great thinker of our time, and he creatively developed the theories of Marxism-Leninism under new historical conditions. Stalin's name stands rightfully alongside the names of the greatest figures in human history—Marx, Engels, and Lenin." From Comrade Stalin's theories, we can obtain all the existing and newly developed truths of Marxism. If we want to study Marxism-Leninism without striving to study Comrade Stalin's theories well, without understanding Comrade Stalin's teachings, then we will become backward people, we will not be able to understand Marxism-Leninism, and we will not be able to become a true Marxist.

    Lenin once said in his essay "The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism": "The Marxist doctrine is omnipotent because it is true." This statement also applies to the theories of Lenin and Stalin. Comrade Stalin's guidance of the Soviet people in building socialism and defeating fascism for decades, his guidance of the liberation movement of the people of the world, and his relentless and tenacious struggle against all enemies and traitors of the people—all the victories won by these works and struggles demonstrate the omnipotence of Stalin's theories, and the reason why his theories are omnipotent is precisely because they are correct.

    Comrade Stalin's theories are important to us, as Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly and constantly explained. Our Party, following Stalin's theories and under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong, has achieved a great victory in the revolution. Now that we are building our country according to the Soviet model after the victory of the revolution, it is clear that Comrade Stalin's theories guiding the Soviet Union in building socialism will also be invincible here. If we want our construction work to be done well, we must constantly and conscientiously draw lessons from Comrade Stalin's works.

    This explains why studying Comrade Stalin's theories well is the task of our comrades, and especially the task of the comrades of the Marxist-Leninist Academy.

    I believe that our comrades have always been good at responding to Comrade Mao Zedong's call and completing the tasks assigned by the Party. Now, we will certainly be good at responding to Comrade Mao Zedong's call, truly mastering Comrade Stalin's theories, commemorating our great teacher—Comrade Stalin, and building our great country into a strong and happy country like the great Soviet Union.

    Let us advance victoriously under the banner of the great Stalin!

    Eternal glory to the great Comrade Stalin!

### 努力学习斯大林的学说是我们的任务

    努力学习斯大林的学说是我们的任务
    （在马克思列宁学院追悼斯大林同志大会上致词）
    陈伯达
    为着纪念我们伟大的导师约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林同志，毛泽东同志曾经指示我们，要无限地加强中苏两大国人民的友谊，更加紧学习斯大林同志的学说。
    很显然，加紧学习斯大林同志的学说，是马克思列宁学院全体同志更为特别的任务。如果马克思列宁学院的同志们没有努力把斯大林同志的学说学好或者学得更好些，那就是辜负我们伟大的导师斯大林同志，那就是没有遵循毛泽东同志的指示，那就是我们不够称为马克思列宁学院的学生和工作者。
    斯大林同志的学说是代表现在马克思列宁主义发展的最高峰。不论在马克思主义的哲学、政治经济学、历史科学以及关于无产阶级的战略和策略等一切方面，斯大林同志都给了非常特出的崭新的重大的天才贡献。正如马林科夫同志所说的：“斯大林同志是当代的伟大的思想家，他在新的历史条件下，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的学说。斯大林的名字与人类历史上最伟大的人物——马克思、恩格斯、列宁的名字并列而无愧。”从斯大林同志的学说中，我们能够得到马克思主义所已有的和新发展的一切真理。如果我们要学习马克思列宁主义，而不去努力好好地学习斯大林同志的学说，不去领会斯大林同志的教训，那末，我们就将成为落后的人，我们就将不能够通晓马克思列宁主义，我们就将不能够成为
    一个真正的马克思主义者。
    列宁在“马克思主义的三个来源与三个组成部分”的论文中曾经说过：“马克思学说之所以万能，就是因为它正确。”这个说明对于列宁、斯大林的学说也是同样的。斯大林同志在几十年来指导苏维埃人民建设社会主义和战胜法西斯，指导全世界人民的解放运动，对一切人民的敌人和叛徒进行毫不留情的顽强的斗争，这一切工作和斗争所赢得的胜利，都表现了斯大林学说的万能，而他的学说之所以万能，正因为它是正确的。
    斯大林同志的学说对于我们的重要，这是毛泽东同志反复不断地说明了的。我们党遵循斯大林的学说，在毛泽东同志的指导下，取得了革命的伟大胜利。现在我们在革命胜利之后要按照苏联的模样来建设我们的国家，显然，斯大林同志指导苏联建设社会主义的学说，在我们这里，也一定将是无往而不胜的。我们希望我们的建设工作做好，就必须经常认真地从斯大林同志的著作中领取教益。
    这就是说明，为什么好好地学习斯大林同志的学说，乃是我们同志的任务，而对于马克思列宁学院的同志们说来，更是特别的任务。
    我想，我们同志们在各个时候都是善于响应毛泽东同志的号召而去完成党所给的任务的。现在我们也一定会善于响应毛泽东同志的号召，真正学通斯大林同志的学说，来纪念我们伟大的导师——斯大林同志，来把我们伟大的国家建设为像伟大苏联那种模样的强盛和幸福的国家。
    让我们在伟大的斯大林的旗帜下百战百胜地前进！
    伟大的斯大林同志永垂不朽！
