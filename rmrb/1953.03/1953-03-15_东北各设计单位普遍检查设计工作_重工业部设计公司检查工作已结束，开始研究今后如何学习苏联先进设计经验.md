Inspection of engineering designs has been universally launched in various industrial departments of Northeast China. Since this newspaper exposed the erroneous design of the Northeast First Ceramics Factory, the Design Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry took the lead in starting inspections, exposing various erroneous designs, and criticizing various erroneous ideas. At present, the inspection by the Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has ended, and it is now studying how to learn from advanced Soviet design ideas and technologies in the future to improve the quality of design work. Design departments of the Northeast Mechanical Industry Bureau, Nonferrous Metal Industry Bureau, Building Materials Industry Bureau, Chemical Industry Bureau, Electrical Appliance Industry Bureau, Coal Mining Bureau, and Textile Industry Bureau have also successively begun inspection work.

Before the inspection work, many technicians in the above-mentioned design departments thought: "We have inspected many times in the past; now we have to inspect again, isn't it just the same old routine!" Individual leading cadres feared that the inspection work would affect the completion of tasks. However, after the inspection work, they discovered many erroneous designs that had not been discovered in the past, and were greatly surprised, unanimously feeling that "inspection work is too important."

In the inspection of engineering designs, various design departments found that insufficient attention was generally paid to design data in the past. In the past, although various design departments repeatedly emphasized verbally that design cannot be carried out without thorough exploration and investigation, this principle was not seriously implemented in actual work. The Northeast Coal Mining Bureau did not pay attention to geological drilling work for a long time, and the importance of geological drilling work was not repeatedly publicized among cadres and technicians at all levels, and the phenomenon of no one being responsible for drilling work has not yet been eliminated. Due to incomplete data, some shaft projects are often reworked. Some designers of the Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry made the design of the scutcher workshop of the Jinzhou Textile Factory without surveying, resulting in cracks in the factory building, which prevented the installation of machines and affected production. When the Nonferrous Metal Industry Bureau designed the school buildings of higher vocational schools, it did not seriously investigate the geological conditions in advance; the foundation of this school building has two kinds of soil, and the ground bearing capacity was determined based on only one kind of soil. After the school building was built, the walls of the school building cracked because the force on the foundation was unbalanced. A designer from the Northeast Mechanical Industry Bureau designed a coal washing machine for the 25th Machinery Factory, and without understanding the design data, he actually drew the drawings based on a photo in an American book. The Design Department of the Bureau also collected 4,000 copies of design data, but half of the data was incorrect and could not be used as the basis for design.

Through inspection work, various design departments learned that the phenomenon of not paying attention to geological data occurred mainly because the designers were not responsible enough for the cause of the country. Some designers were careless and casual when collecting and studying data, mistakenly thinking that "design data is unimportant," and even thinking: "Collecting data is trivial clerical work, why should we engineers bother?" A designer from the Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry did not conduct scientific tests when understanding the ground bearing capacity, but touched the soil with his hand and affirmed: "This ground bearing capacity should be 20 tons," and used this as the basis for the design. A designer from the Northeast Mechanical Industry Bureau, when investigating the distance between a school and a substation, actually sat on the train and calculated the distance based on the train's travel time and the number of miles the train traveled per hour. Zhao Guangxin, a designer from the Northeast Building Materials Industry Bureau, did not investigate water source data when designing, thinking: "As long as it is a piece of land, where is there no water?" Due to irresponsibility, many errors occurred in the design.

In the inspection work, many erroneous designs found were inseparable from the bourgeois ideology of the designers. The Northeast Electrical Appliance Industry Bureau had criticized the bourgeois ideology of some designers, but in this inspection work, it was still found that some designers used the backward quotas of the American Westinghouse Company. For example, when determining the quota of the press in the bakelite molding workshop of the 14th Electrical Factory, the Westinghouse Company's standard was used. If the Soviet standard is used, several presses can be saved. Chen Dingxin, deputy engineer of the Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, reviewed: "When I picked up the drawings, I thought of British and American standards." He said that he never considered the issue of saving when he did designs in the past.

In the past, many designers did not communicate with each other when designing. Those who did civil engineering design did not understand the production situation; those who did mechanical design did not know what the whole factory looked like. The people in the heating technology group of the Northeast Electrical Appliance Industry Bureau who designed warm air and those who designed heating were sitting in the same room, but did not communicate with each other, resulting in the heating pipes and warm air pipes colliding with each other. The designers of the Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Building Materials Industry Bureau also had the phenomenon of "professional jealousy." This lack of overall concept also affected the design work.

In design work, the situation of neglecting the labor safety and health welfare of the workers is also very common. Some designers said: "I also say that I care about the welfare of the workers, but I forget about the workers when drawing."

The occurrence of these situations is also due to the fact that many leading cadres neglect the ideological education of designers. Although some design departments also organize designers to study politics and carry out criticism and self-criticism; they rarely analyze which design ideas are correct and which are incorrect from the design itself, so some designers say: "I have listened to many political reports, and I can put many 'hats' on myself, but I still don't know what is right and what is wrong, and I don't know what to do in the future."

In this inspection work, the designers received a great education because the erroneous designs were specifically criticized. The designers said: "In the specific analysis of engineering designs, I realized that my past views were wrong." Chen Dingxin, deputy engineer of the Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, used to admire the British and American bourgeois designs and did not learn from the Soviet experience. He always thought he was great. However, in this inspection work, everyone exposed the errors in his design of the medium-sized motor factory and pointed out the reasons for the errors, which made him realize the harm of his erroneous ideas to the country's construction. He made a review in front of the masses and expressed "to transform himself well and seriously learn from Soviet experience." After the review, he worked very actively. Many designers believe that inspecting designs not only improves ideological level but also improves the ability of design work. After such inspection, this year's design work in Northeast China will improve a step further, laying the foundation for better completion of the heavy capital construction tasks in Northeast China in the future.

    东北各设计单位普遍检查设计工作
    重工业部设计公司检查工作已结束，开始研究今后如何学习苏联先进设计经验
    对工程设计的检查，已在东北各工业部门普遍展开。自本报揭发东北第一陶瓷厂的错误设计以后，鞍山钢铁公司设计处和中央重工业部设计公司首先开始检查，揭露各种错误的设计，批判各种错误的思想。目前重工业部设计公司检查已经结束，正研究今后如何学习苏联先进的设计思想和技术，提高设计工作质量的问题。东北机械工业管理局、有色金属管理局、建筑材料工业管理局、化学工业管理局、电器工业管理局、煤矿管理局、纺织工业管理局等设计部门，检查工作也已陆续开始。
    上述各设计部门在检查工作以前，有许多技术人员以为：“过去我们检查过很多次了；现在又要检查，还不都是那一套！”个别领导干部害怕检查工作会影响任务的完成。但在检查工作以后，发见许多过去没有发见的错误设计，才大吃一惊，一致觉得“检查工作太重要了。”
    各设计部门在检查工程设计中，发见过去对于设计资料是普遍不够重视的。过去各设计部门虽在口头上一再强调没有周密的勘察调查就不能进行设计，但在实际工作中却没有认真贯彻这个原则。东北煤矿管理局很长时间不重视地质钻探工作，没有在各级干部和技术人员中反复宣传地质钻探工作的重要性，钻探工作中无人负责的现象目前还没有消除。因为资料不全，有些竖井工程常常返工。重工业部设计公司有些设计人员没有勘察就做出了锦州纺织厂清花车间的设计，结果厂房裂缝，不能安装机器，影响生产。有色金属管理局在设计高等职业学校校舍时，事先不认真调查地质情况；这个校舍的地基有两种土质，仅根据一种土质确定了地耐力。修好了校舍后，因为地基承受的力量不平衡，校舍墙壁裂了缝。东北机械工业管理局的一个设计人员设计机械二十五厂的洗煤机，不了解设计资料，竟然照着美国一本书上的照片画出了图样。该局设计处也曾搜集了四千份设计资料，但有一半资料是不正确的，不能作为设计的依据。
    各设计部门通过检查工作，了解到不重视地质资料的现象所以发生，主要是因为设计人员对于国家事业不够负责。有些设计人员搜集和研究资料时，马马虎虎，随随便便，错误地以为“设计资料是无关紧要的”，甚至认为：“搜集资料工作，是琐碎的事务工作，我们工程师何必费心呢？”重工业部设计公司有个设计人员了解地耐力的情况时，不作科学的试验，用手摸了摸土壤，就肯定地说道：“这个地耐力应该是二十吨”，就以此作为设计的根据。东北机械工业管理局有个设计人员，调查一个学校和变电所的距离时，竟坐在火车上，根据火车走行的时间和火车每小时走行的里数，推算出距离的数字。东北建筑材料工业管理局设计人员赵光炘在做设计的时候，不调查水源的资料，觉得：“只要是一块土地，那里没有水呢？”由于对工作不负责任，就使得许多设计发生了错误。
    各设计部门在检查工作中，发现的许多错误设计是和设计人员的资产阶级思想分不开的。东北电器工业管理局曾经批判过有些设计人员的资产阶级思想，但在这次检查工作中，仍然发见有些设计人员采用美国西屋公司的落后的定额。如在决定电工十四厂胶木压制车间压床的定额时，就采用了西屋公司的标准。如果改用苏联的标准，可以节省几台压床。重工业部设计公司陈鼎新副工程师检讨说：“我拿起了图纸，就想起了英美的标准。”他说他过去做设计时，根本不考虑节约问题。
    过去许多设计人员在做设计时，互不联系。做土木建筑设计的不了解生产情况；做机械设计的不知道整个厂房是个什么样子。东北电器工业管理局卫生技术组设计暖风的人和设计暖气的人，坐在一个房子里，也不互相联系，结果暖气管和暖风管碰到了一起。重工业部设计公司和建筑材料工业管理局的设计人员，还有“同行相轻”的现象。这种缺乏整体观念的现象，也影响了设计工作。
    在设计工作中，忽视工人群众劳动安全和卫生福利的情况，也是很普遍的。有些设计人员说：“我口头上也说要关心工人福利，但在画图时就忘记了工人。”
    这些情况的产生，也由于不少领导干部忽视对于设计人员的思想教育。有些设计部门虽然也组织设计人员学习政治，开展批评与自我批评；但很少从工程设计的本身来分析哪些设计思想是正确的，哪些是不正确的，因之有些设计人员说：“我听了很多政治报告，也可以给自己戴很多‘帽子’，但我还不知道哪些对哪些不对，也不知道今后应该怎么办。”
    在这次检查工作中，由于具体地批判了错误的设计，设计人员受到很大的教育。设计人员说：“在具体地分析工程设计中，我才觉得我过去的看法错了。”重工业部设计公司副工程师陈鼎新过去崇拜英美资产阶级的设计，不学习苏联的经验，一向认为自己了不起。但在这次检查工作中，大家揭发了他设计中型电机厂的错误，并指出了错误的原因，使他认识了自己的错误思想对于国家建设的危害性，在群众面前作了检讨，并且表示“要好好改造自己，认真学习苏联经验”。检讨之后，工作很积极。不少设计人员认为检查设计不仅提高了思想水平，而且提高了设计工作的能力。经过这样的检查，今年东北的设计工作将会提高一步，为更好地完成今后东北繁重的基本建设任务打下基础。
