Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 13th: The entire commanders and fighters of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, after recently studying Chairman Mao's article "The Greatest Friendship" mourning the death of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Malenkov's speech at the Stalin memorial meeting in Moscow, received tremendous education and resolved to transform their mourning for Comrade Stalin into strength for resolutely defending the national defense, working hard, and studying diligently.

The commanders and fighters of the unit unanimously believe that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, headed by Malenkov, will surely inherit Comrade Stalin's legacy and advance the great cause of communism. Xu Qian, political commissar of the Fourth Detachment of a certain artillery school, said: "Chairman Mao has always taught us that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a party personally nurtured by Lenin and Stalin, a great party that has been tested for a long time. I believe that the CPSU Central Committee and the Soviet government, headed by Malenkov, will certainly be able to shoulder the great cause of Lenin and Stalin." She Kun, a model worker of the East China Air Force, said: "The great unity shown by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people after the unfortunate death of Comrade Stalin has deeply educated and encouraged me. I firmly believe that the world peace, democracy, and socialism camp, headed by the Soviet Union, will become more united and stronger." Many non-Party masses and members of the Communist Youth League are determined to strive to be glorious Communist Party members by raising vigilance, defending national defense, working hard, and studying diligently. Many Communist Party members and responsible cadres are intensifying their studies, determined to arm themselves with Stalin's theories. Cheng Zhongshun, a regimental commander and Communist Party member of a certain unit, whose right hand is disabled and two fingers on his left hand are also injured, making it difficult to write, is working even harder and studying tenaciously. He said: "What do my difficulties matter? I want to arm myself with Comrade Stalin's great theories." The soldiers guarding the front lines of coastal and air defense are strictly carrying out their oaths, standing guard on their battle posts with a hundredfold vigilance, and are ready to strike at any enemy who dares to invade. When performing his duties, naval soldier Kong Fansheng encouraged himself by saying: "Comrade Stalin taught us to always maintain high vigilance and firmness. I must firmly remember his words."

    华东军区和第三野战军全体指战员
    学习悼念斯大林同志的文件受到深刻教育
    【新华社南京十三日电】中国人民解放军华东军区和第三野战军全体指挥员、战斗员，在最近学习了毛主席悼念斯大林同志逝世的文章“最伟大的友谊”和马林科夫同志在莫斯科举行的斯大林追悼大会上的讲话以后，得到极大的教育，并决心把对斯大林同志的悼念，变成坚决保卫国防、努力工作和学习的力量。
    该部指挥员和战斗员们一致相信以马林科夫为首的苏联共产党和苏联政府一定能够继承斯大林同志的遗志，把伟大的共产主义事业推向前进。某炮兵学校四大队政治委员徐谦说：“毛主席一向教导我们：苏联共产党是列宁、斯大林亲手教养起来的党，是久经考验的伟大的党。我相信以马林科夫为首的苏共中央和苏联政府，是一定能够把列宁斯大林的伟大事业担当起来。”华东空军模范工作者佘昆说：“斯大林同志不幸逝世后，苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民所表现的伟大的团结一致，使我受到了深刻的教育和鼓舞，我坚决相信以苏联为首的世界和平、民主和社会主义阵营一定会更加团结和强大。”许多非党群众和青年团员决心以提高警惕、保卫国防、努力工作和学习来争取做一个光荣的共产党员。许多共产党员和负责干部，正加紧地学习，决心以斯大林的学说武装自己。某部团长、共产党员程忠顺，右手残废，左手又伤了两个手指，写字困难，但他正加倍努力地顽强地学习着，他说：“我这点困难算得什么，我要学习斯大林同志的伟大学说武装自己。”守卫在海防、空防前线的战士们，正严格地执行着自己的誓言，百倍警惕地站在自己的战斗岗位上，随时准备打击敢来侵犯的敌人。海军战士孔繁升在执行任务的时候，这样勉励自己说：“斯大林同志教导我们要经常保持高度警惕和坚定，我一定要牢牢记住他的话。”
