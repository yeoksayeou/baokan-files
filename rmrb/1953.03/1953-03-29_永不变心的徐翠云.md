Xu Wanhe, an old man from Zhongnan Village, Dafeng County, Jiangsu Province. When the Japanese invading army occupied this place, his family was very poor. He farmed the land of the landlord Zhao Dayanzi, and even after working hard all year round, he couldn't get enough to eat. Old Man Xu and his wife had only one daughter in their entire lives, named Cuiyun. Cuiyun was pretty and sturdy from a young age, and she followed her parents to the fields to work when she was only seven or eight years old. The old couple loved her like a treasure. Her mother often boasted to the neighbors: "Don't think my Yun'er is a girl, she's more capable than your young men!"

Cuiyun went to the fields every day to pick vegetables and collect grass, and she became very familiar with Chen Erbao, the cowherd of Zhao Dayanzi's family. Erbao often let the cows graze in the wasteland and helped Cuiyun pick up firewood and grass. Sometimes Cuiyun carried it with difficulty, and Erbao would take it and put it on the cow's back to carry; when Cuiyun saw that Erbao's clothes were torn, she often helped him sew them. Seeing that Cuiyun's family often lacked food, Erbao often brought her some wheat cakes and pot scrapings to eat. They established a deep friendship since childhood.

After the Communist Party and the New Fourth Army came, they drove away the Japanese devils, and the poor people rose up to implement rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and overthrew the traitorous landlord Zhao Dayanzi. Houses and land were distributed to the peasants. Cuiyun and Erbao's families both had houses and land from then on. They worked more actively, and life got better day by day. Their relationship became closer and closer. They often helped each other with planting and harvesting, and the two families were like one family.

Under the education of the Communist Party, the two people's consciousness continued to improve, and soon they both gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. Cuiyun became the director of the village women's federation, and Erbao also joined the militia. They worked and produced together, and both had the idea of ​​getting married.

As soon as the Japanese devils surrendered, "Chiang Kai-shek" launched a war against the people. In order to protect the fields and protect the family, Erbao responded to the Party's call and bravely took the lead in joining the army. Before leaving, Erbao said to Cuiyun, "After I leave, I hope you will produce well and write to me often." Cuiyun said, "Don't worry, I will never forget you."

After Erbao joined the army, he fought very bravely. He was awarded the third-class merit in the Huaihai Campaign. When advancing to the south of the Yangtze River, Erbao took the lead in charging and was gloriously wounded, resulting in the amputation of his right leg, becoming a revolutionary disabled soldier.

In August 1950, Erbao returned home after demobilization, and the villagers came to express their condolences. As soon as he arrived home, Cuiyun's mother brought up the prepared tea and snacks. Old Man Xu chatted with him while he was having tea. Cuiyun returned from a meeting in the township and immediately helped Erbao sweep the floor, wipe the table, and tidy the bed. After dinner, the two talked late into the night. After Cuiyun left, Erbao lay in bed, thinking: Cuiyun has been very good to me since she was a child, but now that I have lost a leg and become disabled, how can I marry Cuiyun? Thinking about it, he didn't sleep well all night. But from the next day, Cuiyun helped Erbao cook, wash clothes, and work in the fields every day, taking care of him very thoughtfully. But Erbao always felt like there was a big stone in his heart. Once, he mustered up his courage and asked Cuiyun in a tentative tone: "Cuiyun! Why are you so enthusiastic about me?" Cuiyun said very simply after hearing this: "Erbao, we have been very good since we were young. Now you are wounded for the revolution and shed blood, becoming a glorious revolutionary disabled soldier, so I love you even more..." Erbao felt completely relaxed and happy when he heard this. Since then, their relationship has become closer and closer, and they have been discussing marriage.

However, Cuiyun's parents and several neighbors had very backward ideas and did not agree with them doing so. When Cuiyun went to a neighbor's house, they said to Cuiyun: "What will happen in the future if you follow a disabled person?" Cuiyun's parents also said: "Yun'er, you and Erbao grew up together, and it is right for you to be good to him. Now that he has become a revolutionary disabled soldier, you should take care of him; but if you want to marry him, we old couple will not agree. We only have you, this one daughter, in our entire lives, and we hope to find a capable son-in-law in the future, so we old couple will have someone to rely on. How can parents bear to see you marry a disabled person?" But no matter what they said, they did not shake Cuiyun's heart of loving revolutionary soldiers. On the contrary, she often patiently persuaded her parents and neighbors, explaining why Erbao joined the army and who Erbao became disabled for. She said: "Without Erbao and the others sacrificing themselves to fight the enemy, how could we live such a life today?" In this way, Cuiyun's parents and neighbors gradually understood. Later, they saw that although Erbao was disabled, he could still do light work, and at the same time, the government and local people treated Erbao with great care and respect. Finally, they agreed to their marriage.

After marriage, they went to work, study, and produce together. The couple respected and loved each other, helped each other, and the family was filled with a democratic, harmonious, united and happy atmosphere.

    永不变心的徐翠云
    沈福华　丁苏　成高启　沈亚士
    江苏大丰县中南村，有个徐万和老爹。日本侵略军占领这地方的时候，他家里很穷。种着地主赵大眼子的地，一年累死累活，还吃不上饱饭。徐万和老俩口一辈子只养了一个女儿，名叫翠云。翠云从小就生得俊俏、结实，七八岁上就跟着爹娘下地干活，老俩口疼爱得像宝贝似的。她妈常在邻居面前夸耀说：“别看我家云儿是个闺女，比你们的小伙子还顶事哩！”
    翠云每天到地里拣菜、拾草，和赵大眼子家的放牛小伙计陈二宝玩得很熟。二宝常把牛放在荒地里吃草，来帮助翠云拣柴拾草。有时翠云背得吃力，二宝就接过来放在牛背上驮着；翠云见二宝衣服破了，也经常帮他缝补缝补，二宝见翠云家常缺粮食吃，就时常弄些面饼、锅巴给翠云吃。他俩从小就这样建立了深厚的感情。
    共产党、新四军来了以后，赶走了日本鬼子，穷苦人起来实行减租减息，斗倒了汉奸地主赵大眼子，房屋田地分给了农民。翠云和二宝家从此都有了房子、田地，劳动更加积极，日子一天一天好起来，二人的感情也一天一天更加亲密，经常你帮我种地，我帮你收割，两家人好像一家一样。
    在共产党的教育下，两人的觉悟不断提高，不久都光荣地参加了中国共产党，翠云当了村妇联主任，二宝也参加了民兵。两人一起工作，一起生产，都有了结婚的念头。
    日本鬼子刚投降，“蒋该死”就发动了反人民的战争。为了保田、保家，二宝响应党的号召，勇敢地带头参了军。临走时，二宝对翠云说：“我走了以后，希望你好好生产，经常给我写信。”翠云说：“你放心，我永远也不会忘记你。”
    二宝参军后，作战很勇敢，在淮海战役中就立了三等功；向江南进军时，二宝带头冲锋，光荣负伤，结果割掉了一只右腿，成了革命残废军人。
    一九五○年八月，二宝复员回家，乡亲们都来慰问。刚一到家，翠云妈就把烧好的茶和点心端上，徐老爹一边陪他吃茶，一边就和他拉起话来。翠云从乡里开会回来，马上就帮助二宝扫地，抹桌子，整理床铺。吃过晚饭，两人谈到深夜。翠云走后，二宝躺在床上，心想：翠云从小就和自己很好，可是如今自己失掉了一只腿，成了残废，怎么能和翠云结婚呢？想来想去，一夜都没睡好。可是从第二天起，翠云就天天帮二宝做饭、洗衣，下地干活，照顾得非常周到。但是二宝心里总像有块大石头一样。有一次他鼓起了勇气带着试探的口气问翠云说：“翠云！你为什么对我这样热情？”翠云一听，很干脆的说：“二宝，我们小时就很好，现在你又为革命负了伤，流了血，成了光荣的革命残废军人，所以我更爱你了……。”二宝一听这话，心里顿时完全轻松愉快起来。自此以后，他们的感情越来越亲密，并且商谈着结婚的事情。
    可是翠云的父母和几家邻居思想非常落后，都不同意他们这样做。翠云到一家邻居家去的时候，他们对翠云说：“跟着一个残废人将来怎样收场呀？”翠云父母也说：“云儿，你和二宝从小一块长大，你跟他好，他现在又成了革命残废军人，你照顾他是应该的；可是你要跟他结婚，我老俩口就不答应。我们一辈子只有你这一个闺女，指望将来找个能劳动的女婿，我老俩口也有个靠头。你嫁给一个残废人，做娘老子的怎忍心呢？”可是不管怎样说，都没有动摇翠云热爱革命军人的心。相反地，她还经常耐心地向父母和邻居进行说服，解释二宝为什么要参军，二宝成了残废为的是谁。她说：“没有二宝他们舍身忘己的去打敌人，我们还能过今天这样的日子？”这样，翠云父母和邻居们思想渐渐搞通了。以后他们看到二宝虽然残废，但是还能干轻活，同时政府和当地群众对二宝又是非常爱护尊敬，最后也就同意他们结婚了。
    结婚后，他俩不论工作、学习、生产都是同来同去，俩口子互敬互爱，互相帮助，家庭里充满了民主和睦、团结愉快的气氛。
