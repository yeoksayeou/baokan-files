Stalin. The telegram reads as follows:

Dear Comrades, the Romanian people are infinitely saddened to learn of the passing of Comrade J.V. Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, comrade-in-arms of U.I. Lenin, and the brilliant successor to his cause. Our people's hearts are filled with sorrow, just as the Soviet people's are. On behalf of the Romanian people, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Government of the Romanian People's Republic, and the Presidium of the National Assembly, we extend to the brotherly Soviet people, who have lost Comrade Stalin, their wise leader, and the organizer of their historic victories, the sincere sympathy of the Romanian people. The passing of Comrade Stalin is an equally grievous loss for all progressive humanity. Comrade Stalin, together with Lenin, illuminated the path to victory for the working people of the world in their struggle for socialism, democracy, and peace. Comrade Stalin was the wise commander of the armies that rescued humanity from fascist enslavement and the standard-bearer in the struggle for peace. He devoted his life to the cause of the masses, to the cause of freedom, independence, and equality of rights for all nations. The hearts of all the working people of Romania are filled with sincere gratitude to Comrade Stalin for liberating our country from the shackles of imperialism, for helping our people like a father in our most difficult times, and for pointing out the path of socialist construction for our people. The Romanian people called Comrade Stalin their best and dearest friend, their wise father and teacher. The name of Comrade Stalin will forever live in the memory of our working people. Members of our Party and all our people know that all our achievements are due to our reliance on the friendship and support of the great Soviet people, the builders of communism. The working people of the Romanian People's Republic are determined to remain faithful to the cause of Lenin and Stalin in the future, to unite even more closely around the banner of the Party—the banner of Lenin and Stalin—and to further strengthen the lasting and unbreakable friendship with the great Soviet Union. Millions of men and women—workers, working peasants, intellectuals, soldiers—will continue to redouble their efforts to consolidate the people's democratic system, develop the national economy, and raise the living standards of the working people. The Romanian people, together with all the national minorities in the country, will work with enthusiasm and vigor in factories, mines, government offices, schools, and laboratories to ensure the complete victory of socialism in our country. Closely united with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, we will work unswervingly to strengthen peace and cooperation among all nations. We will constantly strengthen the defense capabilities of our motherland, so that we can resolutely strike back at any aggressor who attempts to undermine our national independence and state sovereignty. We will learn from the invincible Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Party of Lenin and Stalin, protect the unity of our Party as we protect the apple of our eye, continue to strengthen the unity of the people around the Party, the Central Committee of the Party, and the Government of the Romanian People's Republic, raise vigilance against the conspiracies of enemies within and outside the Romanian People's Republic, and strengthen our uncompromising stance in the fight against enemies. The brilliant teachings of Stalin, the memory of the wise teacher of the workers, Comrade J.V. Stalin, will forever remain in the hearts of hundreds of millions of working people throughout the world, who are inspired by Stalin's great ideas and have unwavering confidence in the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism. Immortal be the great genius of progressive humanity, the beloved father of the working people, J.V. Stalin!

Xinhua News Agency, March 8th, Moscow (TASS dispatch on March 7th): The Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, condoling the death of J.V. Stalin. The telegram reads as follows: Dear Comrades,

We are deeply grieved by the death of our beloved teacher, leader, and liberator, Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. In these sorrowful days, the Hungarian Working People's Party and all the Hungarian people are closing their ranks more closely. We will do everything in our power to live up to the legacy of the great Stalin and to raise even higher the banner he has entrusted to us. We must firmly and consistently adhere to the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. We cherish brotherly loyalty to the glorious Soviet Union, which is building communism, we are closely united with the powerful peace camp, and we are also realizing in our country the eternally living ideas of Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the world's people.

Xinhua News Agency, March 8th, Berlin (ADN dispatch on March 7th): The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) held a memorial service for J.V. Stalin on the 6th. All members of the Central Committee stood in silence, listening to the announcement from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

The SED Central Committee's telegram to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stated: "Dear Comrades! The death of the great leader of progressive humanity has filled not only you and all the Soviet people with boundless grief, but also the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the people of the German Democratic Republic. The heart of Lenin's comrade-in-arms and the brilliant successor to Lenin's doctrines, our teacher and father, has ceased to beat. This has caused immense sorrow to all comrades, all peace-loving people, and all democrats in Germany.

The German people thank Lenin and Stalin for restoring and further developing the greatest spiritual heritage of the German people—the teachings of Marx and Engels. Stalin's death is a sorrow for all progressive humanity, and an especially heavy loss for the German nation, which is striving to build a new life for itself.

Before the great, immortal leader, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany vows: The Socialist Unity Party of Germany will unite more resolutely and closely with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is inseparable from Stalin. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany will forever be loyal to the invincible teachings of Stalin; on the basis of Stalin's teachings, it will strengthen the Party ideologically and organizationally, and will intensify its efforts to lead the German people to the victory of the cause of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is convinced that the German Democratic Republic will make even greater efforts to strengthen the unbreakable friendship with the Soviet people, who stand at the forefront of the world peace camp. Our working people will work even harder to consolidate the foundations of our people's democratic system and lay the foundations for socialism. They will more resolutely thwart all enemy conspiracies, and they will further strengthen the power of the German Democratic Republic. They will fight with greater determination for peace and the restoration of German unity.

In these sorrowful days, we vow: We will maintain an unbreakable connection with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the leading force of the international working-class movement.

We have lost Stalin, but his work will be immortal!"

Xinhua News Agency, March 8th, Berlin (ADN dispatch on March 7th): Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, sent a telegram to N.M. Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, condoling the death of Stalin. The telegram reads as follows:

"Stalin was the best friend and teacher of us all. He was the wise leader of all peace-loving humanity. Moreover, I regarded Stalin as a father who cared meticulously for our German people. The German people feel the deepest sorrow at his death, especially at this time when many forces are trying to hinder the unity and peace of their country.

Now, the German people must unite more firmly around the great Soviet people's calm peace policy and invincible strength, and their army, so that another great war, which would bring immeasurable consequences, does not have a chance to occur.

When I heard the news of the death of our beloved Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, my grief was indescribable. I feel the same sadness as you, the Party, the government, and the Soviet people."

Xinhua News Agency, March 8th, Moscow (TASS dispatch on March 7th): The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic sent a telegram to the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union condoling the death of J.V. Stalin. The telegram reads as follows:

Upon hearing the news of the death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the Government of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting today to express its deep mourning.

The Government of the German Democratic Republic and the people of the entire country, and all progressive and peace-loving people in Germany, are extremely saddened by the death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the best friend of the German people and the warrior who stood at the forefront of the struggle for world peace.

Under the brilliant leadership of Marshal Stalin, the glorious Soviet Army defeated Hitler fascism and liberated the German people from the fascist shackles.

Even during the Second World War, J.V. Stalin opposed the imperialists' conspiracy to destroy Germany. He worked to establish a unified, democratic, peace-loving, and independent Germany, and in the Potsdam Conference resolutions, he outlined the path to achieving this goal.

He laid the foundation for sweeping away the Konzern [Corporations] and Junker [Prussian Aristocracy] classes and achieving broad democratic development in this former occupied territory. After the Western countries divided Germany, he helped establish the German Democratic Republic.

Thanks to the constant and extensive assistance of the powerful Soviet Union and our beloved J.V. Stalin himself, the German Democratic Republic was able to begin laying the foundations for socialism on the basis of public ownership.

The foreign policy under the leadership of J.V. Stalin inspired the German people in their struggle for unification and the conclusion of a peace treaty, strengthened their forces, and enabled them to launch a great national movement to resist the policy of the American imperialists in concluding a war treaty.

The Soviet government, under the leadership of J.V. Stalin, constantly fought for the convening of a Four-Power Conference to peacefully resolve the German question, which strengthened the indelible and lasting friendship of all German patriots with the Soviet people.

The Government of the German Democratic Republic, on behalf of all German patriots, asks the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union to accept its heartfelt condolences on the death of the beloved leader of all working people, the great and wise Stalin.

The German Democratic Republic and all sincere patriots and peace advocates in Germany assure the Soviet people that their friendship with the Soviet people is unbreakable and that their determination to fight tirelessly for the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, as J.V. Stalin taught, is unshakable.

In these sorrowful days when the tragic news of Comrade Stalin's death has overwhelmed us, I want to tell you how I share the infinite sorrow of the Soviet people and their Communist Party. Stalin was the leader, friend, and brother of the working people of the world. He was, and will continue to be, our leader and role model for all of us. The French Communists and working people will forever follow his teachings, especially his final advice at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, regarding the struggle for peace and national independence, for democracy and socialism. I also want to express my brotherly sentiments to the comrades of the Central Committee, assuring them of my steadfast loyalty to the cause of the immortal Stalin and the great communist cause.

With brotherly greetings!

    他为在这个前占领区里扫清康采恩和容克阶级、达到广泛的民主发展奠定了基础，在西方国家把德国分裂以后，他又帮助建立了德意志民主共和国。
    由于强大的苏联和我们亲爱的约·维·斯大林本人的经常而广泛的帮助，德意志民主共和国才得以开始在公有制的基础上为社会主义建立基础。
    在约·维·斯大林领导下的外交政策，鼓舞了为统一与缔结和约而斗争的德国人民，加强了他们的力量，使得他们能够展开一个抵抗美帝国主义者缔结战争条约的政策的伟大的全国性运动。
    苏联政府在约·维·斯大林领导下不断为召开四国会议和平解决德国问题而奋斗，这加强了一切德国爱国者心里对苏联人民的不可磨灭的持久的友谊。
    德意志民主共和国政府谨代表德国全体爱国者，请苏联部长会议接受它对于全体劳动人民敬爱的领袖、伟大英明的斯大林的逝世的衷心哀悼。
    德意志民主共和国和德国一切真诚的爱国者与和平拥护者向苏联人民保证，他们对苏联人民的友谊是坚不可摧的，他们像约·维·斯大林所教导的那样不倦地为和平、民主和社会主义的事业而奋斗的决心是不可动摇的。
