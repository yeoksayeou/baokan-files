    Huainan Bagongshan New Coalfield
    Exploration Project Fully Commences

    The exploration project for the new coalfield in Bagongshan, Huainan Mining Area, Anhui Province, has fully commenced. Drilling rigs distributed around the new coalfield are operating day and night, and a new surveying team arrived at the site in early March and began surveying and mapping work. The first batch of civil engineering construction projects on the mountains near the new coalfield also commenced successively after March 5th.
    The Bagongshan new coalfield is one of the main coalfields for construction in the East China mining area. It is located on a plain stretching over twenty miles along the south bank of the Huai River. Preliminary estimates indicate that it contains reserves of over one billion tons of high-quality coal, of which 50 to 70 percent can be used for coking. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    淮南八公山新煤田
    勘探工程全面开工
    安徽省淮南矿区八公山新煤田的勘探工程已全面开工。分布在新煤田四周的钻机正在昼夜不停地转动着，一支新的测量队已在三月初旬到达工地，开始了测绘工作。紧靠着新煤田附近矿山上的首批土木建筑工程也在三月五日以后相继开工。
    八公山新煤田是华东矿区建设的主要煤田之一。它在淮河南岸长达二十余里的一片平原地带上，据初步估计埋藏量在十亿吨以上，煤质很好，其中有百分之五十到七十的煤炭可用于炼焦。  （据新华社讯）
