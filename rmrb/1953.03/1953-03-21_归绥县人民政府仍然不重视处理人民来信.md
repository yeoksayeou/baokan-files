    Gui Sui County People's Government Still Does Not Value Handling Letters from the People
    Reader Xingguang writes: The People's Government of Guisui County, Suiyuan Province, still treats letters from the people with a bureaucratic attitude. Last year, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government forwarded thirteen letters from the people to the county for handling. Although urged multiple times through phone calls, expediting slips, letters, and face-to-face discussions, only one was answered under duress; the rest received no response. This has left the demands and opinions of the masses unresolved for a long time, and has affected the relationship between the government and the masses. Wang Guanghua, the comrade in charge of handling letters from the people in the county, once said:
    "Because the leadership does not value or support it, there isn't even an office space, so the work cannot be carried out." Last May, the General Office of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government sent people to the county to help study this work. At that time, Gao Chonglin, the acting county head, verbally promised to improve, but in reality, there was no improvement afterward. After the "Zhang Shunyou incident," the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government instructed all levels of people's governments under its jurisdiction to check the handling of letters from the people, and after the People's Daily published a criticism on September 10th last year, "Gui Sui County People's Government Does Not Value Handling Letters from the People," the county checked and also made a self-criticism (see the People's Daily of November 2nd last year), but the actual situation remained the same. The county not only failed to clear the letters from the people received before the criticism, but also failed to respond in any way to the letters from the people forwarded by the Provincial People's Government after the criticism. I suggest that the People's Supervision organs of Suiyuan Province inspect and handle the above situation.

### 归绥县人民政府仍然不重视处理人民来信

专栏：读者来信摘要

    归绥县人民政府仍然不重视处理人民来信
    读者星光来信：绥远省归绥县人民政府仍然以官僚主义态度对待人民来信。去年，绥远省人民政府转给该县处理的人民来信十三件，虽经多次用电话、催办单、信件、面谈等方式催办，但除被迫答复一件外，其余都没答复。这使群众提出的要求和意见长期得不到解决，并且影响了政府和群众的关系。该县负责处理人民来信的王光华同志曾经谈过：
    “因为领导上不重视、不支持，连办公地点都没有，所以业务无法开展。”去年五月，绥远省人民政府办公厅派人去该县帮助研究过这一工作，当时该县代县长高崇林口头答应改进，实际上后来毫未改进。在“张顺有事件”后，绥远省人民政府曾经指示所属各级人民政府检查处理人民来信的情况，以及去年九月十日人民日报刊载了“归绥县人民政府不重视处理人民来信”的批评后，该县检查了，也检讨了（见去年十一月二日人民日报），但实际仍然是老样子。该县不但没有清理受批评以前的人民来信，且对受批评以后省人民政府转去的人民来信，也没有作任何答复。我建议绥远省的人民监察机关对上述情况检查处理。
