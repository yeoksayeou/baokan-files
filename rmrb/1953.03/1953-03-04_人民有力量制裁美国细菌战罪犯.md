    "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Publishes Editorial
    The Voices of People Worldwide Against America's Heinous Crimes Grow Louder

    Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: According to the Romanian News Agency Bucharest on the 1st, the journal "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" published an editorial in its ninth issue of 1953 entitled "Documents Exposing Bacterial Warfare Criminals," stating: The confessions of captured senior American military officers, Colonel Schweibler and Major Bley, provide more irrefutable evidence for the already established extensive facts of the American human-haters conducting bacterial warfare against Korea and China.

    The editorial states: The confessions of Schweibler and Bley reveal the strategic plans and objectives of the U.S. military command in conducting bacterial warfare against the heroic Korean people, as well as the methods and tools for conducting this heinous war. Their confessions reveal to the world that the American plague generals, rulers, and the true masters of America—the Rockefeller family, the DuPont family, the Morgan family, and the Mellon family, who have become rich by sucking the blood and frantically exploiting millions of people—are extremely evil criminals and deadly enemies of peace and the people worldwide. The American aggressors are single-mindedly attempting to establish the rule of American monopoly capital throughout the world through large-scale human destruction and the implementation of fascist terror.

    The editorial points out that they are invading Korea, expanding day by day, and continuing to enlarge the scale of their crimes. However, the heroic sons and daughters of Korea and the Chinese People's Volunteers are recreating the immortal achievements of the heroes who defended Stalingrad, inflicting heavy military and political defeats on the American aggressors. The U.S. imperialists, enraged by the failure of their bloody gamble, shamelessly trample on the basic principles of human morality, wantonly destroy all international laws, and, with the cruelty of professional executioners, formulated a bacterial warfare plan—using bacterial weapons to massacre the Korean people on a large scale.

    The editorial states: The American militarists are doing everything possible to prevent world public opinion from knowing about their preparations for bacterial warfare and their launching of bacterial warfare in Korea. The propaganda machine monopolized by billionaires and the official American representatives in the United Nations have tried and are still trying to deny the well-known facts, confirmed beyond doubt, about the American use of bacterial weapons. Their insidious attempts only show that they are evading the truth, just as shadows evade the sun. They fear world public opinion, fear their own people, and fear their officers and soldiers.

    The American rulers shamelessly deny the use of criminal methods of large-scale massacres of people and refuse to ratify the Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of Bacterial Weapons under various pretexts. This clearly shows that they have no intention of undertaking international obligations and intend to use this weapon in the future as well. The U.S. imperialists, following a policy of expanding the predatory war in the East, have intensified in the past and are still intensifying their aggressive actions against the Korean and Chinese people. They deliberately interrupted the armistice negotiations at Panmunjom when they were about to succeed and took even more intolerable and unprecedented terror actions against captured combatants and officers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, turning prisoner-of-war camps into torture chambers and places for massacring prisoners of war. This atrocity is not accidental; it is an inseparable part of the U.S. imperialist robber policy. The U.S. imperialists not only do not want a peaceful resolution of international problems but are also trying every possible means to expand this massacre and plunge humanity into a new world war.

    The editorial concludes: Today, these American maniacs have been driven into a corner by the confessions of American military officers who are particularly trusted and familiar with the situation. These confessions are undeniable, cannot be ignored, and cannot be evaded. These confessions point to only one path, the path to the severe, ruthless, and great people's court. The aggressive policy adopted by the American ruling clique has aroused the hatred and contempt of people all over the world. The voices of hundreds of millions of people in Europe, Asia, the Near East and Middle East, Africa, and Latin America against American rule, against the tyranny of monopoly capital across the Atlantic, and against the heinous crimes of the American militarists are growing louder and louder. The confessions of officers of the American armed forces about the cruel conspiracies to destroy humanity and about the execution of these conspiracies have touched the conscience of progressive people in all countries. Peace-loving people demand an end to the Korean War, and they have the power to restrain the bacterial warfare criminals.

    Soviet "Pravda" Observer Writes
    Exposing the American Ruling Group's Frantic Attempt to Deny the Confessions of Captured American Officers

    Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: According to TASS Moscow on the 2nd, "Pravda" observer V. Korionov pointed out: Regarding the confessions of captured American officers, Colonel Schweibler, Chief of Staff of the First Marine Air Wing, and Major Bley of the same wing, American newspapers have remained silent like mutes. However, it is obvious to everyone that this attitude of "keeping silent with ulterior motives" is enough to confirm the crimes committed by the American interventionist army in Korea. At the same time, their failure to let the American public know about the documents proving that the American ruling group and senior military authorities are guilty of using bacterial weapons in Korea also proves that the heads of the Pentagon are clearly frantic.

    The statement by General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, particularly reveals this frantic situation. He did not dare to deny the facts cited in the confessions of Schweibler and Bley. He could only ramble on and mumble that he "doubted" the confessions of the two captured American officers, but later Clark himself actually confirmed the use of bacterial weapons, because he hinted that infectious diseases would soon break out again in North Korea and foolishly explained that this was because spring was coming soon.

    Korionov wrote: The confessions of Schweibler and Bley tell us how the American ruling group tried every possible means to conceal the crimes committed in Korea in accordance with their orders. But these criminals have not been able to hide their atrocities, just as they can never escape punishment after committing heinous crimes. The truth about the evil deeds of the American aggressors in Korea is known to the whole world. Today, everyone knows that the American military authorities regard inhuman bacterial warfare, the cruel and planned bombing of peaceful residential areas, schools, hospitals, and kindergartens, and the unprecedented atrocities against unarmed prisoners of war as America's so-called "national policy."

    Korionov concluded: The morality and conscience of peace-loving humanity cannot tolerate these crimes. Hundreds of millions of people in all countries support the Soviet delegation's firm demand in the United Nations for an immediate cessation of the bloody war in Korea.

    New York "Daily Worker" Publishes Editorial
    Calling on the American People to Intensify Opposition to Bacterial Warfare and Strive for an Immediate Armistice in Korea

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 3rd: The New York "Daily Worker" published the news of the confessions of captured American Air Force officers Schweibler and Bley regarding American bacterial warfare on February 23rd. The newspaper published an editorial on the 26th, stating: The confessions of Colonel Schweibler and Major Bley add many new facts to the "solemn report published in September 1952 and signed by world-renowned scientists." "These scientists, after studying the accusations of bacterial warfare on the spot, cited examples of bacterial warfare. Dr. Joseph Needham, Dr. Andrean and other scientists said that there was sufficient evidence to prove that the spread of bacteria in North Korea and China had occurred."

    The editorial continued: At the same time, people all over the world do not understand why Washington refused to ratify the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which prohibits bacterial warfare, in the United Nations? Why did Washington refuse to allow an impartial investigation team composed of scientists, legal workers, and others from around the world to investigate this accusation on the spot, and insisted that an organization handpicked by it, dominated by Chiang Kai-shek's running dogs, should conduct the investigation?

    The editorial concluded: "We Americans bear some responsibility for the terrible war crimes committed in Korea, for the crime of burning villages and burning people to death with napalm bombs. This new accusation from Beijing encourages us to intensify our struggle, to demand the prohibition of all bacterial warfare, to urge Washington to sign the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and to allow on-the-spot investigation of this accusation. It is especially important that we should strive for an immediate ceasefire to end the terrible Korean War."

    人民有力量制裁美国细菌战罪犯
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报发表社论
    全世界人民反对美国滔天罪行的声音越来越响亮了
    【新华社三日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特一日讯：“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报一九五三年第九期发表题为“揭露细菌战罪犯的文件”的社论说：被俘获的美军高级军官许威布尔和布莱的供词，对于早已确定了的美国仇恨人类者对朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的大量事实，提供了更多的无可辩驳的证据。
    社论说：许威布尔和布莱的供词揭露了美军司令部对英勇的朝鲜人民进行细菌战的战略计划和目标，以及进行这种罪恶的战争的方法和工具。他们的供词向全世界揭露了：美国瘟疫将军、统治者和美国的真正主人——靠吸血和疯狂剥削千百万人民致富的洛克菲勒家族、杜邦家族、摩根家族和梅隆家族——是穷凶极恶的罪犯，是和平与全世界人民的死敌。美国侵略者一心想用大规模毁灭人类和实行法西斯恐怖的办法，在全世界建立美国垄断资本的统治。
    社论指出他们侵略朝鲜，一天比一天扩大并继续扩大犯罪的规模。但是，英勇的朝鲜儿女和中国人民志愿军在重现保卫斯大林格勒的英雄们的不朽业绩，他们使美国侵略者在军事上和政治上遭到惨重的失败。美帝国主义者因他们的血腥赌博失败而恼羞成怒，他们无耻地践踏人类道德的基本原则，恣意破坏一切国际法，带着职业刽子手一样的残忍心肠，拟订了细菌战计划——用细菌武器来大规模屠杀朝鲜人民。
    社论说：美国军国主义分子竭力设法不让世界舆论知道他们准备细菌战和在朝鲜发动细菌战的情况。亿万富翁所独占的宣传机器和联合国中的美国官方代表，过去试图而现在仍试图否认确凿证实了的关于美国使用细菌武器的人所共知的事实。他们的阴险企图只表明，他们躲避事实真相，正像阴影躲避太阳一样。他们害怕世界舆论，害怕他们自己的人民，害怕他们的官兵。
    美国统治者无耻地否认使用大规模屠杀人民的罪恶方法，以各种借口拒绝批准关于禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书，这清楚地表明了他们无意承担国际义务，他们打算在以后也使用这种武器。美帝国主义者遵循着扩大在东方的掠夺战争的政策，过去加紧进行现在还在加紧进行反朝中人民的侵略行动。他们在板门店停战谈判快要成功的时候故意使谈判中断，并对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘的战斗员和军官采取更加令人不能容忍的空前的恐怖行动，他们把战俘营变成刑房和屠杀战俘的地方。这种暴行并不是偶然的，这是美帝国主义的强盗政策的一个不可分割的部分。美帝国主义不仅不想和平解决国际问题，而且还千方百计地设法扩大这个屠杀，把人类投入新的世界大战中。
    社论最后说：今天，这些美国狂徒已因特别受信任的熟悉情况的美军军官的供词而被弄得走头无路。这些供词是否认不了的，是不能置之不理也无法逃避的。这些供词只指出一条道路，走向严厉的无情的伟大的人民法庭的道路。美国统治集团采取的侵略政策，已引起全世界人民对它的仇恨和蔑视。欧洲、亚洲、近东和中东、非洲和拉丁美洲的亿万人民的反对美国统治，反对大西洋彼岸的垄断资本的专横。和反对美国军国主义分子滔天罪行的愤怒的声音越来越响亮了。美国武装部队的军官关于毁灭人类的残忍阴谋和关于执行这些阴谋的供词触动了各国进步人民的良心。爱好和平的人民要求结束朝鲜战争，他们有力量来约束细菌战罪犯。
    苏联“真理报”观察员撰文
    揭露美国统治集团手忙脚乱不敢否认被俘美军官的供词
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：“真理报”观察员维·科里奥诺夫指出：对于被俘的美国军官海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长上校许威布尔和该联队少校布莱的供词，美国报纸像哑吧似的没有讲一句话。不过所有的人都可以明显看出：这种“不声不响心怀鬼胎”的态度，正足以证实美国干涉军在朝鲜所犯的罪行。同时，他们不让美国公众知道那些证明美国的统治集团和高级军事当局犯有在朝鲜使用细菌武器罪行的文件，也证明五角大楼的头子们显然已经手忙脚乱。
    美国远东军总司令克拉克将军的声明，特别显出这种手忙脚乱的情形。他不敢否认许威布尔和布莱的供词里举出的事实。他只能东拉西扯咕咕噜噜地说，他“怀疑”那两个被俘的美国军官的供词，但是后来克拉克本人实际上也证实曾使用细菌武器，因为他暗示说预料不久将来北朝鲜又要发生传染病，而且还愚蠢地解释说这是由于春天快要来了。
    科里奥诺夫写道：许威布尔和布莱的供词告诉我们，美国统治集团是怎样千方百计地掩饰遵照他们的命令在朝鲜所干的罪行。但是这些罪犯们并没有能够掩藏住他们的暴行，正如他们犯了穷凶极恶的罪行以后决不能逃脱惩罚一样。美国侵略者在朝鲜所干的罪恶行为的真相，是全世界都晓得的。今天大家都已晓得，美国的军事当局把灭绝人性的细菌战，对于和平的住区、学校、医院和幼儿园进行的残酷的有计划的轰炸，以及对于手无寸铁的战俘们所干的从来没有见过的暴行，都算是美国的所谓“国家政策”。
    科里奥诺夫最后写道：爱好和平的人类的道义和良心，是不能容忍这些罪行的。世界各国的亿万人民都拥护苏联代表团在联合国所提出的立即停止朝鲜的流血战争的坚决要求。
    纽约“工人日报”发表社论
    号召美国人民加紧反对细菌战并争取立即在朝鲜停战
    【新华社布拉格三日电】纽约“工人日报”在二月二十三日发表了被俘美国空军军官许威布尔和布莱关于美国进行细菌战的供词的消息。该报在二十六日发表社论说：许威布尔上校和布莱少校的供词，给“一九五二年九月发表的、由世界著名的科学家们签字的庄严报告书”增加了许多新的事实。“这些科学家们在实地研究了细菌战的指责之后，举出了细菌战的实例。李约瑟博士、安德琳博士以及其他科学家都说，有证据足以证明，在北朝鲜和中国散布细菌的事曾发生过。”
    社论接着说：同时，全世界人民都不明白，为什么华盛顿在联合国拒绝批准一九二五年签订的禁止进行细菌战的日内瓦议定书？为什么华盛顿拒绝让世界上的科学家和法律工作者以及其他的人组成的公正的调查团去就地研究这种指责，而硬要它一手挑选的、蒋介石走狗之流的人占重要地位的机构去调查？
    社论最后说：“我们美国人对在朝鲜进行的可怕的战争罪行，对用凝固汽油弹烧毁村庄和烧死人的罪行是负有一部分责任的。北京提出的这种新的指责鼓舞我们加紧进行斗争，要求禁止一切细菌战，促使华盛顿在一九二五年的日内瓦议定书上签字，并允许就地研究这种指责。尤其重要的是，我们应当争取立即停火，以结束可怕的朝鲜战争。”
