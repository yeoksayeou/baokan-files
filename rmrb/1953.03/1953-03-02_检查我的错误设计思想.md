    Examining My Erroneous Design Ideology
    Zhang Yun, Engineer, Design Department of the Northeast Electrical Industry Administration Bureau

    Three years ago, we began designing the Fourth Electrical Engineering Factory, and I was responsible for designing the riveting and welding workshop. During this design work, many erroneous design ideologies were exposed.

    I interned at Westinghouse Electric Company in the United States for two years, and I knew some superficial things about the production and equipment of riveting and welding workshops. I thought I could "show off my skills" this time. When I started designing, I didn't properly study the principles of machine load factor and how many machine tools should be equipped according to production needs. I just selected as many machine tools as I had seen in the riveting and welding workshop of Westinghouse Company based on American machine samples, advocating that the more variety, the better. I felt that if I didn't do this, I couldn't show myself. As a result, the riveting and welding workshop was arranged in a dazzling array. I looked at it with great satisfaction, thinking that this would "make me famous throughout the country." Dominated by this "masterpiece" thinking, I rashly used the state's investment in building factories for my personal pursuit of fame. Later, because our design of a comprehensive factory including the production of steam turbines, hydraulic turbines, generators, switches, transformers, and all electrical products was rejected, my design of the riveting and welding workshop was not adopted. Looking back now, if the construction had been carried out according to my design, the wasted state investment would probably have been calculated in tens of billions of yuan.

    After the design of the comprehensive motor factory was criticized, in 1951, we redesigned the Fourth Electrical Engineering Factory, and I was still responsible for designing the riveting and welding workshop. At that time, I thought, "Our country's riveting and welding operations are still in the stage of semi-handicraft industry. It would be good enough to reach the 'level' of Westinghouse Company." Therefore, the machine load factor and machine tool time quota used in the riveting and welding workshop were all based on Westinghouse standards. Last year, we compared these quotas with the advanced Soviet quotas, and we realized that Westinghouse's time quota was very backward and conservative. Taking manual electric welding (arc welding) as an example, the Soviet time quota was 40% faster than Westinghouse, and the gas cutting (flame cutting) time quota was 25% faster than Westinghouse; Soviet equipment operates 4,600 hours a year in two shifts, while we use the Westinghouse quota, and the equipment only operates 2,500 hours a year, which means that the Soviet equipment usage year is 84% higher than Westinghouse. If we add these two aspects together, according to the Westinghouse quota design, five welding machines are needed, and according to the Soviet quota design, only two welding machines are needed to complete the same amount of work. However, because the entire factory design has already been affirmed, this error is irreversible. As a result, it wastes investment and keeps production at a backward level. In terms of equipment selection, I once selected a three-ton steam hammer because I saw that Westinghouse had such a steam hammer, and I felt that we should have one too. During the "Three-Anti" movement last year, after careful inspection, we found that our forgings were very large, and a ten-ton steam hammer was needed to solve the problem. At the same time, there were few such forgings, and it was possible to order them from Anshan Iron and Steel. It was completely unnecessary to select a three-ton steam hammer. Just removing this steam hammer would save more than 3 billion yuan of state investment. Now, when I check, the idea that "it is good enough to reach the level of Westinghouse Company" is the result of my long-term acceptance of bourgeois education. In the production increase and economy movement last year, the workers in the cold work workshop of the Fifth Electrical Engineering Factory, who were folding oil tanks, changed the old and simple manual bending machine. The production efficiency of making small oil tanks has approached or exceeded the new electric bending machine. Although this workshop still uses the oldest and simplest equipment for sandblasting and painting, their time quota has in some cases exceeded the Westinghouse quota. These facts made me realize that the power of the liberated working class is immeasurable, and people with bourgeois technical viewpoints cannot recognize this great power. This also shows that my thinking is far behind the actual actions of the workers.

    In the process of designing the riveting and welding workshop of the Fourth Electrical Engineering Factory, there was also such a thing: According to the product drawings designed by Westinghouse Company, the yokes of giant motors need to use steel plates that are 50 to 150 cm thick and 500 to 1,000 cm wide. During the production process, these steel plates must be heated red, rolled into rings, and then welded with electric welding. I also selected a vertical plate rolling machine and a steel plate heating furnace. Later, because such a rolling machine could not be bought, I consulted Soviet experts. The Soviet expert asked me: "If you heat a 150 cm thick steel plate to the temperature of red forging and then send it to the rolling machine, the workers will be scorched by the red-hot steel plate every day. Are you willing to do this job?" I immediately thought that the person in charge of the rolling machine at Westinghouse Company was a black man. He was sweating profusely at work; I was standing two meters away from him and was so scorched that I dared not stay for a moment. The Soviet expert's question made me feel very ashamed. When I selected such equipment, I didn't think about the workers' working conditions at all. This is a typical bourgeois design ideology! I think that if our designers "can't figure it out" when considering working conditions in the design, it is best to ask themselves first whether they are willing to work in such an environment.

    In addition, I often take a careless and perfunctory attitude towards the scientific and meticulous design work of "a slight deviation leads to a great error." For example, for the most valuable horizontal and vertical multi-head hydraulic presses for correcting and forming that the riveting and welding workshop needs, because I didn't know the time quota, I didn't calculate the machine load and casually selected one; when deciding on the assembly area, I didn't carry out scientific and reasonable calculations, and I just randomly designated some areas. I don't know whether these assembly areas will be enough for future production. I also did not make detailed calculations for the auxiliary materials used in the riveting and welding workshop, such as oxygen, acetylene, and welding rods, but just made a rough estimate. This will affect the design of the entire factory's warehouse transportation system in the future.

    Examining my designs over the past three years, it is not difficult to see that the bourgeois technical viewpoint dominated me to adopt the backward Westinghouse Company time quota, ignoring the advanced Soviet quota; it dominated me to pursue personal "masterpieces" and want to "become famous throughout the country"; it dominated me to be careless and not serious and responsible. Although some erroneous designs have been corrected in time with the help of Soviet experts, some are irreversible. The bourgeois technical viewpoint is the biggest enemy of our correct design and the most fundamental cause of wasteful design. We must expose and criticize the bourgeois technical viewpoint. The advanced Soviet design experience is the guideline for our design work, and we must actively learn it.

    检查我的错误设计思想
    东北电器工业管理局设计处工程师　张鋆
    三年前，我们开始设计电工四厂，我负责设计铆焊车间。在这一设计工作中，暴露了很多错误的设计思想。
    我在美国西屋电气公司实习过两年，关于铆焊车间的生产、设备知道一些皮毛，自己以为这回可以“大显身手”了。开始设计时，我没有很好地研究机器负荷率、根据生产需要应该配备多少机床等原则问题，只是根据美国机器样本，把我在“西屋”公司铆焊车间所看见过的各种机床，尽可能地选用上去，主张花样愈多愈好，觉得不这样就不能表现自己。结果把铆焊车间布置得琳琅满目，自己看看很得意，以为这样就可以“名扬全国”了。在这种“杰作”思想支配下，我就轻率地把国家建筑工厂的投资，用到我个人追求名誉上去了。后来，因为我们设计出来的这样一个包括生产蒸汽透平、水力透平、发电机、开关、变压器及所有电工产品的综合性工厂被否定了，我做的铆焊车间的设计也就没有被采用。现在想起来，假如按照我的设计施工，浪费的国家投资恐怕要以几十亿元计算。
    综合性电机工厂设计被批判后，一九五一年，我们又重新设计电工四厂，我还是负责设计铆焊车间。当时我想：“我国铆焊作业还停留在半手工业阶段上，能够达到西屋公司的‘水平’已经不错了。”因此，铆焊车间采用的机器负荷率、机床工时定额，都是用西屋公司的标准。去年，我们曾把这些定额和苏联的先进定额对比了一下，我们才认识到“西屋”的工时定额是非常落后和保守的。拿手工电焊（弧焊）来说，苏联的工时定额比“西屋”快百分之四十，气割（焰割）工时定额，苏联比“西屋”快百分之二十五；苏联每年两班设备要运用四千六百小时，而我们采用“西屋”定额，每年设备只运用两千五百小时，就是说苏联设备运用年时比“西屋”的要高百分之八十四。如果把这两方面加起来，根据“西屋”定额设计，需要五台电焊机，根据苏联定额设计，只需要两台电焊机就可以完成同样的工作量。但是因为整个工厂设计已经肯定了，这个错误已经不可挽回。结果既浪费了投资，同时使生产停留在落后的水平上。在选用设备方面，我曾选用了一台三吨蒸汽锤，原因是我看“西屋”有这样一台蒸汽锤，觉得我们也应该有。在去年“三反”运动中，经过仔细检查，才发现我们的锻件很大，非十吨蒸汽锤不能解决问题，同时这样的锻件少，很可以到鞍钢去订货，选用一台三吨蒸汽锤完全没有必要。只去掉这一台蒸汽锤，就少浪费国家三十多亿元投资。现在检查起来，“能够达到西屋公司水平已经很不错了”这种想法，正是我长期接受资产阶级教育的结果。在去年增产节约运动中，电工五厂冷作车间折弯油箱部分的工人，改变了旧的简陋的人工折弯机，做小油箱的生产效率已经接近或超过了新式电动折弯机。虽然这个车间吹砂喷漆，还是利用最陈旧、最简陋的设备，但是他们的工时定额有的已经超过“西屋”的定额。这些事实使我认识到，解放了的工人阶级的力量是不可估计的，有资产阶级技术观点的人，是不可能认识到这种伟大力量的。这也说明了我的思想还远远落在工人实际行动的后面。
    在设计电工四厂铆焊车间的过程中，还有过这样一件事情：照西屋公司设计的产品图纸，巨型电动机的磁轭，都需要用五十到一百五十公分厚、五百到一千公分宽的钢板，在生产过程中，必须把这种钢板烧红后滚成环状然后再用电焊焊上。我就照样选用了一台立式滚板机和一台钢板加热炉。后来，因为这样的滚板机买不到，才去请教苏联专家。苏联专家问我：把一百五十公分厚的钢板烧到红锻的温度，再送入滚板机，工人每天要被烧红的钢板熏烤，你愿意干这个活吗？我立即想到我在西屋公司看到掌握滚板机的是一个黑人，他在工作中满头流着汗水；我离他站的地方有两公尺远，已经被熏烤得不敢多停留一刻。苏联专家这样一问，使我觉得非常惭愧。我在选用这样的设备时，根本没想到工人劳动条件问题，这正是典型的资产阶级设计思想！我想，我们设计人员在设计中考虑劳动条件时如果硬是“想不通”的话，最好先问问自己，愿不愿意在这样的环境里工作。
    另外，我对待“差之毫厘，失之千里”的这样科学的细致的设计工作，常常采取粗枝大叶、马马虎虎的态度。比如铆焊车间需要的最贵重的校正与成形用的卧立式多头油压机，我因为不知道工时定额，就不去计算机器负荷，随便选用了一台；在决定装配面积时，也没有进行科学的合理的计算，就随便指定一些面积，至于将来生产时这些装配面积够不够，我还不知道。对于铆焊车间用的辅助材料，例如氧气、电石气、电焊条等等，也没有进行详细计算，只是随便估计了一下。这在将来就会影响全厂的仓库运输系统的设计。
    检查我三年来所作的设计，不难看出，是资产阶级技术观点支配我采用了落后的西屋公司工时定额，忽略了苏联先进的定额；是它支配我，追求个人的“杰作”，想“名扬全国”；是它支配我，马马虎虎不够认真负责。虽然在苏联专家帮助下，某些错误设计已及时得到了纠正，但是有的已是无法挽回了。资产阶级技术观点，是我们进行正确设计的最大的敌人，是造成浪费设计的最根本的原因，我们必须揭发、批判资产阶级技术观点。苏联先进设计经验，是我们设计工作的指针，必须积极地进行学习。
