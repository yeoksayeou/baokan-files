    The North China Administrative Committee's Cultural and Educational Committee convened the North China Region Cultural and Educational Work Conference from February 20th to 26th. The conference earnestly discussed the central government's decided cultural and educational work policy of "Rectification and Consolidation, Focused Development, Guarantee of Quality, and Steady Progress," corrected various incorrect thoughts hindering the implementation of this policy, and formulated the 1953 cultural and educational work plan.
    The conference examined the situation of cultural and educational work in the North China Region based on the central government's policy. The conference believed that the cultural and educational work in the North China Region had made certain achievements in recovery and development in the past, but due to a lack of planning and blind impetuosity, there are indeed many problems at present. This is mainly manifested in: a large number of developments, insufficient strength, and therefore extremely unconsolidated. There is a serious lack of leading cadres and teachers, which affects the quality of teaching. Due to weak political and ideological leadership, bureaucracy is prevalent in the cultural and educational system, and incidents of violations of law and discipline, and coercion are constantly being exposed. Attendees repeatedly discussed and studied the central government's policy through reviewing past work, and formulated the 1953 cultural and educational work plan. The plan determined that, in terms of secondary education, efforts should be made to fully equip the positions of school principals and deans before the summer vacation this year, appropriately adjust the leading backbone, actively cultivate and equip political instructors, and improve the political work of the schools. Starting from this summer vacation, existing secondary schools will be adjusted in a planned manner. The adjustment policy is to vigorously develop senior high schools and post-secondary normal schools, appropriately develop junior high schools, and begin to tighten the policy of primary normal schools and discontinue short-term teacher training classes. From the perspective of long-term construction, the temporary classes attached in the past using revolutionary methods should be unified with the establishment of regular schools, so that they gradually have a certain scale and move towards specialization, solving the chaotic phenomenon of inconsistent school settings and tasks. Industrial secondary technical schools have already undergone preliminary adjustments last year. Like agricultural secondary technical schools, their current main task is to set up majors in conjunction with local characteristics and strive for specialization. Financial and economic secondary technical schools in the region have been determined to be adjusted into six specialized financial and economic schools for finance, banking, commerce, industrial management, cooperation, and statistics. All primary schools in the region will be rectified by the end of July this year. In terms of health work: industrial and mining health administrative and business organizations should be established and improved; health personnel should launch a study campaign. The conference also studied the issue of improving quality in cultural work and made specific regulations.
    The conference proved that to make cultural and educational work move from blindness to planning and implement the central government's policy, there must be sharp ideological struggle. The blind development in the past has indeed brought some concrete difficulties to the current work, and coupled with the evil of departmentalism, it often confuses the eyes of many comrades. They consciously or unconsciously raise questions from the perspective of their respective regions, existing foundations, and local difficulties, requiring the national plan to adapt to themselves, emphasizing "facing reality" and "agreeing in principle, but solving specific problems." When the national plan cannot adapt to their own requirements, negative thoughts arise, understanding "rectification and consolidation" as "mergers and reductions" and "restricting the development of undertakings," and even generating resistance and complaining about leadership. The conference discussion also reflected that the greatest difficulty in solving problems is due to the widespread bureaucratic work style, lack of investigation and research, unclear situation, countless people in upper and lower levels are clueless, the lower level blindly shouts difficulties, but cannot raise any specific difficulties, and the leadership suffers from not understanding the situation and cannot accurately answer or criticize the difficulties raised by the lower level. The conference discussion focused on criticizing the above-mentioned thoughts. Zhang Panshi, director of the North China Administrative Committee's Cultural and Educational Committee, emphasized in his summary: Blind impetuosity divorced from the economic foundation essentially reflects a kind of "building the country through culture and education" thought, which not only harms the country's industrialization, but also makes it impossible for itself to develop. He also pointed out: There are indeed some difficulties in incorporating work into the national plan, but difficulties must be treated with correct thinking and correct analysis methods. Some difficulties will be eliminated in the process of implementing the policy of "rectification and consolidation"; at the same time, it should be consciously recognized that for the benefit of national industrialization, some difficulties cannot be solved or should not be solved at present; if some general regulations cannot fully adapt to the actual situation, and the difficulties arising in the work are within the scope that can be solved and must be solved, requests can be made to the central government to make some local adjustments within the overall plan.
    The North China Cultural and Educational Committee and its various bureaus have decided to transfer more than half of their cadres to conduct in-depth inspections and help various localities implement the resolutions of this conference.

### 华北区文教工作会议订好今年工作计划  着重批判了脱离经济基础的盲目冒进思想

    华北区文教工作会议订好今年工作计划
    着重批判了脱离经济基础的盲目冒进思想
    华北行政委员会文化教育委员会二月二十日到二十六日召开了华北区文教工作会议；认真讨论了中央所决定的“整顿巩固，重点发展，保证质量，稳步前进”的文教工作方针，纠正了阻碍贯彻这一方针的各种不正确的思想，并制订了一九五三年的文教工作计划。
    会议根据中央方针检查了华北区文教工作的情况。会议认为，过去华北区文教工作在恢复与发展上是有一定的成绩的，但由于缺乏计划性，盲目冒进，目前确实存在很多问题；这主要表现在：发展数量很大，力量不足，因而极不巩固。领导干部与师资严重缺乏，影响了教学质量。由于政治思想领导薄弱，官僚主义在文教系统中普遍存在，违法乱纪、强迫命令的事件不断被揭发。到会者从检查过去工作中反复讨论研究中央方针，制订了一九五三年的文教工作计划。计划中确定：在中等教育方面，争取在今年暑假前将学校校长和教导主任的缺额配备齐全，适当调整领导骨干，积极培养和配备政治教员，健全学校的政治工作。今年暑假开始有计划地调整现有中等学校，调整的方针是大力发展高中及后期师范，适当发展初中，开始紧缩初等师范及停办短期师资训练班的方针；从长期建设着眼，将过去用革命办法临时附设的班次与正规学校的设置统一起来，使之逐渐具有一定规模并走向单一化，解决学校设置与任务不专的混乱现象。工业性质的中等技术学校，在去年已经过初步调整，它和农业性质的中等技术学校一样，目前主要是结合各地特点设置专业，并力求单一化；财经性质的中等技术学校，全区已确定调整成为财政、银行、商业、工业管理、合作与统计等六个单一化的财经学校。全区小学在今年七月底以前全部整顿完毕。在卫生工作方面：要建立与健全工矿卫生行政及业务组织机构；卫生人员展开学习运动。会议对文化工作中的提高质量问题也进行了研究并作出了具体的规定。
    会议证明：要使文教工作从盲目性走向计划性并贯彻中央方针，必须有尖锐的思想斗争。过去的盲目发展，确实给当前工作带来了一些具体困难，更加上本位主义思想的作怪，就常常迷糊了许多同志的眼睛。他们自觉地或不自觉地从各自地区、原有基础、局部困难出发提问题，要求国家的计划与自己相适应，强调“面对现实”，“原则同意，但要解决具体问题”。当国家计划与自己要求不能相适应时，则发生消极的想法，把“整顿巩固”理解为“裁并削减”“限制事业发展”，甚至产生抵触情绪，埋怨领导。会议讨论中还反映出解决问题的最大困难是由于普遍存在官僚主义的作风，缺乏调查研究，情况不明，上下心中无数，下边盲目叫喊困难，到底有什么具体困难提不出来，领导上苦于不了解情况，对下面提出的困难也不能确切地回答批判。会议讨论中着重批判了上述思想。华北行政委员会文化教育委员会主任张磐石在总结中强调指出：脱离经济基础的盲目冒进，实质上反映了一种“文教建国”思想，其结果不仅危害国家工业化，而且自身也不可能得到发展。他同时指出：把工作纳入国家计划，确有某些困难，但必须以正确思想、正确的分析方法对待困难。有些困难会在贯彻“整顿巩固”的方针中被消灭；同时应自觉地认识到：为了国家工业化的利益，有些困难目前不能解决也不应解决；如遇到有些一般规定不能完全适应实际情况，而工作中所产生的困难又属于可以解决和必须解决的范围的，可请示中央在总计划内作某些局部调整。
    华北文化教育委员会与各局已决定抽调一半以上干部，深入检查，帮助各地贯彻这次会议的决议。     （新华社）
