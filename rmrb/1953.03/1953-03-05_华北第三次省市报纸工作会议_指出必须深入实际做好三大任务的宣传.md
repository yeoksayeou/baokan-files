    North China's Third Provincial and Municipal Newspaper Work Conference
    Points Out the Need to Go Deep into Reality and Do a Good Job of Propaganda for the Three Major Tasks
    The Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened the Third Newspaper Work Conference of various provinces and cities in January. In addition to discussing how newspapers should adapt to the requirements of the new situation and further go deep into reality to do a good job of reporting on large-scale economic construction, the conference also specifically required local newspapers to conduct reports based on the three major tasks of the people of the country this year.
    The conference affirmed: Since the Second Newspaper Work Conference in August 1951, newspapers in North China have made achievements in improving ideological content and implementing the popularization policy. However, it also pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in the current newspapers in North China. The main one is that they fail to grasp the main issues in the economic work in their reports. For example, some newspapers are not good at grasping and publicizing the decisive and key advanced experiences when reporting on advanced experiences in industrial production; some newspapers publicize experiences that are not advanced as advanced experiences, and publicize inventions that are not significant as significant inventions; some newspapers fail to discover and grasp the new problems in finance, trade, and agricultural production in a timely manner; and even some editors and reporters still have the careless and unrealistic "armchair strategist" style, so the work of these newspapers cannot meet the requirements of the country and the broad masses of people. The conference believes that it will be difficult to complete the reporting tasks of large-scale national construction if the newspaper editorial departments do not change their unfamiliarity with industrial production. Therefore, the conference organized Tianjin Daily, Shanxi Daily, and Hebei Daily to make three typical speeches on industrial production reports, agricultural production reports, and going deep into reality and contacting the masses, organized the attendees to study the New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily and documents on economic construction propaganda, and visited the newspaper exhibition held by the newspaper and periodical department of the North China Bureau Propaganda Department. Then, after group discussions and general discussions, the problem of going deep into reality and doing a good job of economic construction reporting was solved. Regarding how to do a good job of reporting on national construction, the conference pointed out: First, in the past, the newspapers' propaganda on industrial production was only aimed at the workers and staff of factories and mines, and it focused more on the propaganda of pure operation techniques, and rarely publicized the relationship between industrial production and the people. In the propaganda of construction work in agriculture, commerce, culture, and education, it is also rarely linked to the overall task of industrialization. In the propaganda, what is promoted and what is opposed is often not clear enough. In the future, it is necessary to explain the important significance and prospects of industrialization to the people, to clarify the relationship between industrialization and the people, and to strengthen the propaganda of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and national construction, in order to educate the people and do their own work well, and to support the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and national construction in all aspects. Second, it is necessary to strengthen the guiding role of newspapers in industrial construction and industrial production. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the idea of ​​focusing on key construction projects, and oppose the one-sided mass viewpoint of trying to complete "good things" in one morning and the departmentalism and localism that undermine the unified national plan; it is necessary to promote the concept of economic accounting, advocate careful calculation and strict budgeting, oppose the remnants of the supply system in enterprise management, and oppose those who do not calculate costs, do not care about national capital accumulation, and do not pay attention to product quality and worker safety in industrial production competitions. It is necessary to promote leading cadres to learn new things, advocate delving into and becoming experts, and oppose conservative thinking and bureaucracy. Third, special attention should be paid to the propaganda of capital construction. Someone at the meeting asked whether it is necessary to publicize capital construction in areas where there is no capital construction task or the task is not large? The meeting believes that the country's major capital construction must be vigorously promoted in any region. Because the country's major capital construction is a major event related to the interests of the people of the country, and promoting the significance of capital construction to national industrialization and its relationship with the people will encourage the enthusiasm of the people in various regions for work and production. Fourth, in terms of agricultural production, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the propaganda to organize peasants, carry out production according to national plans, improve farming methods, and increase yield per unit area, so as to mobilize peasants to actively support national industrialization. Fifth, in order to effectively guide this year's industrial and agricultural production, attention must be paid in reporting to: not only correctly reflect the changes in objective reality, but also be good at walking ahead of the movement, timely raising and solving problems, firmly grasping the party's policies and lines, conscientiously and boldly carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and constantly fighting against erroneous ideas and erroneous behaviors that violate the party's policies and lines; pay attention to cultivating typical examples and establishing advanced banners, not only publicizing model figures, but also publicizing model factories, model mines, model villages, and model counties.
    Regarding the issue of going deep into reality, the conference pointed out: At present, our newspaper staff do not understand production issues well, so they show a lack of understanding or insensitivity, which makes it difficult to do a good job of economic reporting. To overcome this shortcoming, it is necessary to go deep into reality. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to overcome the current busy situation within the newspaper, so that leaders can get rid of the circle of administrative affairs and contact the problems in actual work. Reality is multifaceted. The various problems in production work that newspaper staff personally encounter when going down to factories and villages are, of course, the most direct practical knowledge; other things, such as the intentions of the Party Committee that reflect the actual work of a region, letters and letters from readers reflecting various situations and problems in production and life, various materials, reports, summaries, and materials that report and reflect the actual work, are also reality. Therefore, in terms of going deep into reality, it is necessary to start from many aspects. But the most important thing is to strengthen the theoretical and policy study of newspaper staff and the investigation and research of going down to factories and villages. Strengthening investigation and research is convenient for directly contacting practical problems; strengthening theoretical and policy study is convenient for improving the ability to analyze and understand problems. Therefore, theoretical study and going deep into reality are both very important. But in terms of the current situation, most newspaper staff lack perceptual knowledge of practical problems, so going deep into reality is more important. Other things, such as further strengthening close ties with local party organizations and leading organs at all levels, and further strengthening the research on incoming articles and letters, are also important methods for newspapers to go deep into reality and contact the masses.
    Regarding the methods of responsible cadres and editors of newspapers going down to factories and villages, the conference, based on the experience of Hebei Daily and Shanxi Daily last year, especially pointed out: (1) Going down must be planned and purposeful, and must be based on certain reporting tasks and for the purpose of researching certain problems, and must not run around blindly; (2) Many problems will be encountered after going down, and it is necessary to be good at grasping the essential problems from various complex phenomena. Only by grasping the essential problems can we avoid the mistake of only grasping the surface phenomena; we must go deep, and we must have a global perspective, so as to avoid making the mistake of one-sidedness; (3) When a major work is about to begin, when the actual movement encounters obstacles, and when it is necessary to solve an important problem in order to promote the progress of the movement, or when it is necessary to create experience in preparation for the next stage of work, the responsible cadres of the newspaper must go down in person; this is of great significance to strengthening the guidance of the newspaper.
    Regarding some issues of contacting the masses, some representatives also made typical speeches at the conference. For example, Shanxi Daily, in its typical speech on the "1953 Shanxi Daily's Work Plan for Going Deep into Reality and Contacting the Masses," proposed some specific methods: after each group of the editorial department has formulated a draft plan for a movement or a special report, it is necessary to convene a meeting of relevant correspondents or a meeting of leading personnel of relevant departments to read out the plan, listen to opinions, revise it, and finally arrange it; the correspondence reading group should hold a reader symposium once a month according to the reporting center to listen to readers' opinions; and employ consultants to answer questions in government agencies, factories, and rural areas. Beijing Daily also cited an example in the general discussion to illustrate that they had blindness in their reports due to insufficient contact with reality and the masses, and published a fake report by a correspondent who "assigned reporting tasks." Unfortunately, this conference did not conduct a good discussion or propose solutions to these methods of contacting the masses that are related to the entire newspaper's work, as well as how to strengthen correspondence work in economic construction reporting.
    Finally, this conference also specifically pointed out that newspapers must conduct reports based on the three major tasks of the people of the country this year. They must not neglect to continue strengthening the propaganda of the struggle against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea and the convening of the People's Congress because this conference emphasized doing a good job of economic construction reporting. Nor can they neglect the propaganda and reporting of national defense construction, cultural and educational construction, and other political movements. The conference asked newspapers in various regions to pay attention to the possible tendency to bury themselves in production and construction and not ask about politics, as well as the phenomenon that has already occurred in some areas or among some of the masses that they are not concerned enough about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Therefore, the conference pointed out that in addition to doing a good job of reporting on economic construction, it is also necessary to do a good job of reporting on other aspects, especially current political activities.

### 华北第三次省市报纸工作会议  指出必须深入实际做好三大任务的宣传

    华北第三次省市报纸工作会议
    指出必须深入实际做好三大任务的宣传
    中共中央华北局宣传部曾在一月间召开第三次各省、市报纸工作会议。这次会议除讨论了报纸应如何适应新的形势要求，进一步深入实际、做好大规模经济建设报道外，还特别要求各地报纸，必须根据今年全国人民的三大任务进行报道。
    会议肯定指出：华北各地报纸，自一九五一年八月第二次报纸工作会议以来，在提高思想性、贯彻通俗化方针方面是有成绩的。但同时也指出目前华北各地报纸，还存在着不少缺点。其中主要的是在经济工作的报道上，抓不住工作中的主要问题。如有些报纸在报道工业生产的先进经验时，不善于抓紧宣传带有决定性、关键性的先进经验；有些报纸把不是先进经验的经验当做先进经验来宣传，把不是什么重大的创造发明当做重大的创造发明来宣传；有些报纸对财经贸易和农业生产方面的新问题，未能及时发现和抓紧报道；甚至有一部分编辑、记者还存在着粗枝大叶和不实事求是的“客里空”作风，因而这些报纸的工作还不能满足国家和广大人民群众的要求。会议认为：如不改变报纸编辑部对工业生产不熟不懂的情况，是很难完成大规模国家建设的报道任务的。因此，会议组织了天津日报、山西日报、河北日报分别做了关于工业生产报道、农业生产报道和深入实际、联系群众的三个典型发言，组织了到会人员学习人民日报元旦社论和关于经济建设宣传的文件，并参观了华北局宣传部报刊处举办的报纸展览会。然后经过分组讨论和大会讨论，解决关于深入实际和做好经济建设的报道问题。关于如何做好国家建设的报道问题，会议指出：第一，过去各报在工业生产宣传方面，仅仅是面对工厂矿山的职工讲话，而且多偏重于单纯操作技术的宣传，很少向全体人民宣传工业生产与他们的关系。在农业、商业、文教等建设工作的宣传中，也很少和工业化这一总任务相联系。在宣传中，提倡什么，反对什么，也常常提得不够明确。今后必须面向全体人民阐明工业化的重要意义和前途，阐明工业化和全体人民的关系，加强抗美援朝和国家建设的宣传，以教育全体人民、做好自己的工作，从各方面来支援抗美援朝和国家建设的工作。第二，要加强报纸对工业建设和工业生产的指导作用，因此要贯彻宣传重点建设的思想，反对那些企图在一个早晨把“好事”办完的片面的群众观点和破坏国家统一计划的本位主义、地方主义；要宣传经济核算的观点，提倡精打细算，反对企业管理工作中的供给制思想残余，反对那些为完成任务不计算成本，不关心国家资本积累，以及工业生产竞赛中不注意产品质量和工人安全的作法。要宣传领导干部向新鲜事物学习，提倡钻进去变为内行，反对保守思想和官僚主义。第三，要特别把基本建设的宣传放在重要地位。会上有人曾提出在没有基本建设任务或任务不大的地区，是否要宣传基本建设？会议认为：国家的重大基本建设，不论什么地区，均须大力宣传。因为国家的重大基本建设是和全国人民利益有关的大事，宣传基本建设对国家工业化的意义以及和广大人民的关系，会鼓舞各地人民的工作热情和生产热情。第四，在农业生产方面，要继续加强对农民进行组织起来，按国家计划进行生产、改良农作法、提高单位面积产量等方面的宣传，以便动员农民积极支援国家的工业化。第五，为了有力地指导今年的工农业生产，在报道中必须注意：不仅要做到正确反映客观实际的变化，而且还要善于走在运动的前边，及时提出问题和解决问题，要紧紧掌握党的政策和路线，认真大胆地开展批评与自我批评，经常向违背党的政策路线的错误思想和错误行为进行斗争；要注意培养典型，树立先进旗帜，不仅要宣传模范人物，还要宣传模范工厂、模范矿山、模范村和模范县。
    关于深入实际的问题，会议指出：目前我们的报纸工作人员对生产问题还不懂不熟，因而表现心中无数或感觉迟钝，这就难以把经济报道工作做好。要克服这一缺点，就必须深入实际。因此必须设法克服目前报社内部的忙乱现象，使领导人得以摆脱事务主义的圈子，而去接触实际工作中的问题。实际是多方面的。报纸工作人员亲身下厂下乡接触到的生产工作中的各种问题，固然是最直接的实际知识；其他如体现一个地区实际工作的党委意图、读者反映生产生活中各种情况和问题的来稿来信、报道和反映实际工作情况的各种资料、报告、总结、材料等，也都是实际。因此在深入实际方面，需要从多方面入手。但最要紧的，是加强报纸工作人员的理论政策学习和下厂下乡的调查研究。加强调查研究，便于直接接触实际问题；加强理论政策学习，便于提高分析和认识问题的能力。因而理论学习和深入实际都很重要。但就目前的情况来说，大多数报纸工作人员对实际问题的感性知识尤为缺乏，所以深入实际更为重要。其他如进一步和各地方党组织及各级领导机关取得密切联系，进一步加强对来稿、来信的研究，也都是报纸深入实际、联系群众的重要方法。
    在报社负责干部和编辑人员下厂下乡的方法上，会议根据去年河北日报和山西日报的经验，特别指出：（一）下去必须要有计划有目的，要围绕着一定的报道任务和为着研究一定的问题下去，不可盲目地乱跑；（二）下去后会遇到许多问题，必须善于从各种复杂的现象中抓住本质问题，只有抓住本质问题，才能避免只抓表面现象的错误；必须深入，又要具有全局观点，如此才能避免犯片面性的错误；（三）当某一项重大工作将开始的时候，当实际运动遇到障碍，为了推动运动前进需要解决某一个重要问题的时候，当为了下一阶段工作做准备，需要创造经验的时候，报社的负责干部要亲自下去；这对于加强报纸的指导性，是有很大作用的。
    关于联系群众的一些问题，在会议上有些代表还作了典型发言。例如，山西日报在“一九五三年山西日报深入实际、联系群众的工作方案”的典型发言中，曾提出一些具体作法，编辑部各组在制订出一个运动或一个专题报道计划草案后，要召开有关通讯员会或有关部门领导人员会议，宣读计划，听取意见，进行修改，最后布置下去；通讯读报组每月要按报道中心召开一次听取读者意见的读者座谈会；在机关、工厂、农村聘请解答问题的顾问等。北京日报在大会讨论中也曾举例说明他们因和实际和群众的联系不够，报道中产生过盲目性，发表了一个“派报道任务”的通讯员的假报告。对于这些关系整个报纸工作的联系群众的作法，以及在经济建设报道中如何加强通讯工作等问题，可惜这次会议没有进行很好的讨论，和提出解决办法。
    最后，这次会议还特别指出，报纸必须根据今年全国人民的三大任务进行报道，决不能因这次会议强调了做好经济建设报道工作，而忽视继续加强抗美援朝斗争和召开人民代表大会两大任务的宣传，也不能忽视如国防建设、文教建设及其他政治运动的宣传报道。会议要求各地报纸注意可能发生的埋头生产建设、不问政治的倾向，以及目前事实上在部分地区或部分群众中已经发生的对抗美援朝关心不够的现象。因此，会议指出，除了做好经济建设的报道外，也必须做好其他方面特别是时事政治活动的报道。
