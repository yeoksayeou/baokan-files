Leading Cadres of the Northeast Fourth Electrical Factory Disregard the Marriage Law, Resulting in Three Suicides Due to Marital Problems

In a span of nine days, from November 26th to December 4th of last year, three suicide incidents involving female workers due to marital problems occurred successively at the Northeast Electrical Industry Bureau’s Harbin Fourth Electrical Factory. This series of events fully exposes the serious feudalistic thinking and bureaucratic work style of leading cadres at all levels of the Fourth Electrical Factory, who disregard freedom of marriage and the lives of women.

At approximately 11:00 AM on November 30th of last year, Feng Ruipu (a member of the Communist Youth League), a staff member of the factory's clinic, attempted suicide by swallowing five grains of aminopyrine. Fortunately, she was saved by the hospital. The reason for Feng's suicide was that she was in love with Yang Yushu, a colleague in the same clinic, and they had a good relationship. However, the Communist Youth League branch emphasized that Yang was not a League member and forbade them from marrying, forcing them to break off their relationship. Influenced by the erroneous thinking of the leading cadres, some members of the public made various comments, saying that Feng Ruipu was "messing around with relationships" and had a "bad work style." Under constant ridicule and attacks, Feng was in great mental pain and finally decided to commit suicide.

Before Feng Ruipu's suicide, there had already been an incident in which a female worker, Yi Suwen, attempted to hang herself due to discrimination in her love life. However, the factory's leading cadres did not attach importance or vigilance to these two consecutive suicide incidents. Some cadres even believed that "these are just little girls trying to scare people." They neither conducted in-depth investigations nor promptly educated the masses. As a result, four days later, another incident occurred in which Han Yuping, a female worker in the laboratory (inspection team) of the Sixth Workshop, committed suicide by taking potassium dichromate. Han Yuping was originally a mica worker in the Sixth Workshop. Last autumn, she was promoted to inspector in the laboratory. She and Mo Hongda (a disabled revolutionary soldier and a member of the Communist Youth League) from the Second Engineering Team of the Northeast Electrical Industry Bureau had a good relationship and were engaged. However, their legitimate love relationship also attracted much interference and attacks. Wang Changye, the secretary of the factory's Communist Youth League General Branch, even said that Mo Hongda was a "hooligan." Therefore, Han Yuping felt even more isolated, painful, and hopeless, and finally developed suicidal thoughts.

Before taking poison, Han Yuping had clearly revealed suicidal thoughts. On that day, she cried sadly for a long time, packed her clothes, put on new clothes, wrote four suicide notes, and finally bid farewell to her fellow workers. However, the leading cadres of the factory, from the workshop to the factory level, did not pay attention to this abnormal phenomenon. In particular, after she was discovered taking potassium dichromate in the middle of the night, not a single workshop leader came to her rescue. Zhang Dianshi, a member of the factory's Party General Branch (who had been expelled from the Party during the rectification campaign), came to take a look after receiving the report, waved his hand dismissively, and said: "She won't die. Just send her to the hospital!" Then he went back to sleep. Tang Guang'an, the Party Branch Secretary of the Fifth Workshop, Zhang Zhenjiang, the chairman of the trade union, and Wu Kuizhi, the head of the security section, continued to sleep after receiving the phone report, ignoring the situation. Thus, under the influence of the cadres' serious bureaucratic work style, Han Yuping eventually died due to lack of timely treatment. After Han's death, some cadres even made various sarcastic and mocking remarks. Shi Shucai, the chairman of the trade union, even said: "It's better that she died, it's shameful to be alive."

The successive suicide incidents of female workers in the Fourth Electrical Factory are mainly due to the feudalistic thinking and bureaucratic work style of the factory's leading cadres, as well as the long-term neglect of the publicity work of implementing the Marriage Law. Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the factory has only had cadres from the People's Court give one report to the workers, and the leading cadres have never studied the Marriage Law. Some leading cadres believe that free love between young men and women is "messing around with relationships" and will "affect production." Song Ping, the secretary of the factory's Party General Branch, and Chen Wanrong, a member of the General Branch, even openly opposed the legitimate social interaction between male and female workers. The workers' repeated requests to hold dances were prohibited, and male and female workers dared not sit at the same table when eating, and were separated when attending meetings.

The successive suicides of female workers at the Fourth Electrical Factory have attracted the attention of the relevant leading organs in Harbin City. Currently, in conjunction with this incident, the Marriage Law is being widely publicized in the factory, and investigations and studies of this incident are continuing in order to make appropriate handling.

### 东北电工四厂领导干部漠视婚姻法  连续发生三起因婚姻问题自杀事件

    东北电工四厂领导干部漠视婚姻法  连续发生三起因婚姻问题自杀事件
    东北电器工业管理局哈尔滨电工四厂在去年十一月二十六日到十二月四日九天中，连续发生了女工因婚姻问题而自杀的事件三起。这一系列事件的发生，充分暴露了电工四厂各级领导干部漠视婚姻自由和妇女生命的严重的封建思想和官僚主义作风。
    去年十一月三十日上午十一时左右，该厂医务所工作人员冯睿璞（青年团员）吞服五瓦安眠药自杀，幸经医院急救没有致死。冯自杀的原因是：她和同所工作人员杨玉树恋爱，感情很好。但青年团支部强调杨不是团员，不准他们结婚，并迫使他俩断绝关系。在领导干部的错误思想影响下，有些群众议论纷纷，说冯睿璞“乱搞男女关系”、“作风不正派”，在受到不断的讽刺和打击下，冯精神上非常痛苦，最后决定自杀。
    在冯睿璞自杀前，该厂就曾发生女工仪素文因恋爱受歧视企图自缢未遂的事件。但是，该厂领导干部对这两次连续发生的自杀事件仍未引起重视和警惕，有些干部竟认为“这是小女孩吓唬人”，既不深入调查，也不及时向群众进行教育。结果，四天后又发生了第六车间化验室（检查组）女工韩玉萍服红矾自杀的事件。韩玉萍原是第六车间云母班女工，去年秋天被提升为化验室检查员。她和东北电器工业管理局第二工程队莫宏达（革命残废军人、青年团员）感情很好，并和莫订婚，但他们正当的恋爱关系，也招致许多干涉和打击，该厂青年团总支书记王常业竟说莫宏达是“流氓”。因此，韩玉萍更加感到孤立、痛苦和绝望，终于滋长了自杀的念头。
    韩玉萍在服毒前，曾明显地暴露过自杀思想。当天，她伤心痛哭很久，收拾衣物，换上新衣，又写了四封遗书，最后并向工友们话别。但该厂自车间以至厂的领导干部对此反常现象都未引起注意。特别是当她半夜服红矾被发现后，车间领导干部竟无一人前来救护。该厂党总支委员张殿仕（整党时已被开除党籍）接到报告，来看了一看，轻蔑地挥了一下手说：“死不了，你们把她送医院去就行了！”他就回去睡觉了。第五车间党支部书记唐广安、工会主席张振江、保卫股长武奎志等接到电话报告后，竟继续睡觉，不闻不问。这样，在干部的严重的官僚主义作风影响下，韩玉萍终因不及救治而身死。韩死后，有些干部并加以种种讽刺和讥笑。工会主席史书财竟说：“死了也好，活着丢人。”
    该厂女工连续发生因婚姻问题而自杀的事件，主要是由于该厂领导干部存在着封建思想和官僚主义作风，并长期忽视贯彻婚姻法的宣传工作。该厂自婚姻法公布以来，只由人民法院的干部向工人作过一次报告，领导干部也从没有学习过婚姻法。有些领导干部认为青年男女自由恋爱就是“乱搞男女关系”，会“影响生产”。该厂党总支书记宋平、总支委员陈万荣等甚至公然反对男女工人正当社交，工人几次要求举行舞会都被禁止，男女工人吃饭时也不敢同桌，开会时都分开座位。
    电工四厂女工连续自杀的事件，已引起哈尔滨市有关领导机关的注意，现正结合这一事件，在该厂广泛宣传婚姻法，并继续对这一事件进行调查研究，以便作出适当的处理。（新华社）
