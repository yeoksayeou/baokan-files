The Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau's organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" No. 8, 1953, has been published.

This issue, in celebration of the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army and Navy (February 23rd), published an editorial entitled "Defending the Peace, Security, and Independence of All Peoples," and an article by Emil Bodnăraș, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, entitled "The World-Historical Role of the Soviet Army." The editorial stated: The Soviet Army was established by Lenin and Stalin, the greatest strategists of the proletarian revolution. It is a new type of model army fundamentally different from the armies of capitalist countries. In its early years, it won immortal glory for itself and won the sympathy and love of the working people of the world. During the Second World War, under the leadership of Stalin, the greatest commander in human history, the Soviet Army not only defended the honor, freedom, and independence of its own country, but also rescued the European people from Hitler's enslavement and saved all mankind from the threat of fascist enslavement. It paved the way for all peoples to move towards peace and friendship, national independence, and democratic freedom. Because of this great achievement, all working people and all progressive people in the world love it, respect it, and are deeply grateful to it. The editorial pointed out: In contrast to the Soviet Army, the armies of capitalist countries are armies that implement social and national enslavement of all peoples, armies of aggression and war. The soldiers of these armies are increasingly deeply aware that they are fighting only for a small group of parasitic monopoly capitalists to get rich, which makes them generate anti-war sentiment. This sentiment is especially prevalent in the American army, particularly in the American army in Korea. The editorial concluded: American imperialists are blocked by an insurmountable obstacle on the road to realizing their sinister aggressive war plan. This is the world-scale peace movement, the powerful strength of the Soviet Union and its invincible army, the powerful strength of the socialist camp countries, and their consistent peace policy.

Bodnăraș's article briefly described the glorious achievements of the Soviet Army over the past 35 years and its world-historical contributions. Bodnăraș pointed out: The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have never forgotten the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers, and they are unswervingly fighting for peace and international security. The great Chinese People's Liberation Army and the armies of the people's democratic countries, established according to the glorious example of the Soviet Army, are gloriously defending the new life. The armies of these countries have all the conditions to defend the great revolutionary fruits of the free people and give a powerful armed rebuff to any aggressor.

Important articles published in this issue also include: "The Working People of Czechoslovakia Celebrate the Fifth Anniversary of the February Victory" by Václav Kopecký, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, "International Day Against Colonialism" by Jacques Denis, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, "Zionist Organizations are Spy Agencies of American Imperialism" by M. Mitin, and a summary of the report by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, at the enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

Kopecký's article described the significant achievements of Czechoslovakia in industry and agriculture after the February Victory. In 1952, Czechoslovakia's total industrial output had increased to twice that of 1937, an increase of 18.3 percent compared to 1951. In the first four years of the Five-Year Plan (1949-1953), the total output of heavy industry more than doubled. Czechoslovakia's agriculture is advancing along the road of socialism. In 1952, 38 percent of the country's cultivated land belonged to the socialist sector; the number of unified agricultural cooperatives increased year by year.

Mitin's article, from the entire history and activities of Zionist organizations, explained that it is a widely distributed international spy organization of reactionary Jewish bourgeois nationalism, that it has consistently served imperialism, fascism, and reactionary forces of various countries, and that today it is especially serving American imperialism.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第八期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第八期已经出版。
    本期为庆祝苏联陆海军建军三十五周年（二月二十三日），发表了题为“保卫各国人民的和平、安全与独立”的社论，和罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局委员埃米尔·波德纳拉希的题为“苏军的世界历史性作用”的文章。社论说：苏联军队是无产阶级革命最伟大的战略家列宁和斯大林建立的，它是和资本主义国家的军队根本不同的新型的模范军队。在它建立的最初几年，就为自己取得了不朽的光荣，并赢得了全世界劳动人民的同情和爱戴。第二次世界大战期间，苏军在人类有史以来最伟大的统帅斯大林的领导之下，不仅维护了自己祖国的荣誉、自由和独立，而且把欧洲人民从希特勒的奴役下拯救了出来，把全人类从法西斯奴役的威胁下拯救了出来。它为各国人民铺平了走向和平与友爱、民族独立和民主自由的道路。由于它这种伟大的勋业，全世界一切劳动人民和一切进步人们都热爱它，敬重它，而且深深地感谢它。社论指出：与苏联军队相反，资本主义国家的军队是对各国人民实行社会奴役和民族奴役的军队，是侵略和战争的军队。这些军队的士兵日益深刻地感到，他们打仗不过是为了一小撮寄生的垄断资本家发财，这样就使他们产生了反战的情绪。在美国军队中，特别是在朝鲜的美军中，这种情绪尤其普遍。社论最后说：美帝国主义者在实现他们的罪恶的侵略战争计划的道路上，被一个不可逾越的障碍挡住了，这就是世界规模的和平运动，苏联及其无敌军队的强大力量，社会主义阵营国家的强大力量和一贯的和平政策。
    波德纳拉希的文章简述了苏联军队三十五年来的光荣战绩及其世界历史性贡献。波德纳拉希指出：苏联和人民民主国家一时一刻也没有忘记帝国主义战争贩子的阴谋，它们正在坚持不渝地为和平与国际安全而斗争。按照苏联军队的光辉榜样建立起来的伟大中国人民的军队和人民民主国家的军队，正在光荣地保卫着新的生活。这些国家的军队具有一切条件来保卫自由人民的伟大革命果实，给任何侵略者以强有力的武装回击。
    本期刊载的重要文章还有：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席团委员瓦茨拉夫·柯别茨基的“捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民庆祝二月胜利五周年”，世界民主青年联盟总书记雅克·德尼的“国际反对殖民制度斗争日”，麦·米丁的“犹太复国主义组织是美帝国主义的特务机关”，英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特在英共执行委员会扩大会议上的报告摘要。
    柯别茨基的文章叙述了二月胜利后捷克斯洛伐克在工、农业方面的重大成就。一九五二年捷克斯洛伐克的工业总产量已增加为一九三七年的两倍，比一九五一年增加了百分之十八·三。在五年计划
    （一九四九—一九五三年）头四年中，重工业的总产量增加了一倍多。捷克斯洛伐克的农业正沿着社会主义的道路前进。一九五二年全国耕地面积中，已有百分之三十八属于社会主义成分；统一农业合作社的数目一年比一年增多。
    米丁的文章从犹太复国主义组织的全部历史与活动方面，说明它是反动的犹太资产阶级民族主义的一个分布得很广的国际间谍组织，说明它是一贯为帝国主义、法西斯主义和各国反动势力服务，而今天特别是为美帝国主义效劳的。　（新华社）
