The Tianjin Local State-Owned Third Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory's dyed Xinhua Blue Cloth did not meet its production plan in August and September of last year. At the same time, the quality was very poor. At its lowest, the rate of first-class products was only slightly above 41%, which was criticized and reprimanded by the leadership of the Textile Printing and Dyeing General Factory. In October, after the factory solved the water source problem, the daily output increased from more than 600 pieces to 800 to 900 pieces. With a little more effort, the task of 27,000 pieces of Xinhua Blue Cloth for the whole month could be completed. Kong Fanzhen, the secretary of the factory's Party branch, believed that in the past, they were always criticized by the leadership for failing to complete the plan. This time, with the improvement of production conditions, they must overfulfill the plan and win the banner of the production increase and frugality campaign to show "glory." However, they did not fully mobilize the masses to tap potential and find tricks to improve production and complete the task ahead of schedule. In order to compete with fraternal factories for the banner, Kong Fanzhen instructed statistician Huang Yongsheng (the organization committee member of the factory's Youth League branch) to falsify reports to deceive superiors. The actual amount of 873 pieces of Xinhua Blue Cloth entered into the warehouse on the October 27th statistical daily report was changed to 3,598 pieces; the actual 900 packages bundled were changed to 4,540 packages; the actual 1,353 pieces stretched were changed to 2,353 pieces, and the percentage of first-class and second-class quality was also falsified. In this way, the state production task that could only be fully completed on October 30th was falsely reported as having been fully completed on the 27th. After the report was falsified, they "reported good news" to the General Factory, claiming that they had completed the state task four days ahead of schedule.

Due to the bureaucratic work style of the leaders of the General Factory, they did not carefully review the statistical daily report sent by the Third Factory. They only thought that the Third Factory had been criticized in the past, and now that the factory had completed the plan ahead of schedule, it should be rewarded as soon as possible. So they casually sent four cadres to the factory to understand the situation. The cadres who went to the factory irresponsibly checked a few report figures and then called the General Factory to report: "There is absolutely nothing wrong, the plan has indeed been completed." The General Factory then awarded the banner to the factory based on the report in this phone call.

The process of this matter, except for the factory's financial staff, most of the workers are not clear. Liu Shuzhen, the head of the accounting section of the factory, returned to the factory after attending a meeting at the Local State-Owned Industry Bureau and found that the plan completion in the factory was a bit sudden, and she became suspicious. After a detailed investigation, she discovered that the early completion of the plan was fabricated, and she bravely revealed the truth of this fact.

The State-Owned Tianjin Second Cotton Textile Factory also has many serious false phenomena. For example: in order to falsely report achievements, when the production plan cannot be completed, the factory uses overtime work to top up the previous month's output with the next month's output to "complete the task." In April 1952, although the unit output of the second and third weaving workshops of the factory completed the plan, because the cloth was not bundled and put into the warehouse in time, it affected the completion of the monthly production task (according to regulations, cloth and cotton yarn must be bundled and put into the warehouse before the plan is considered complete). The packaging workers worked overtime on the May 1st holiday to bundle the cloth, and the output of May 1st was included in the production figures for April. Afterwards, the North China Textile Administration Bureau criticized the leading cadres of the factory for this shortcoming. However, the leading cadres of the Second Cotton Textile Factory continued to adopt the method of making false reports to complete the task. In May of the same year, when the factory's cotton yarn production plan could not be completed, they worked overtime on June 1st (Sunday) to bundle 40 pieces of 20-count yarn, which were included in the production figures for May, reporting that the May production plan had been overfulfilled. In July of the same year, the factory's yarn and cloth both failed to complete the plan, and the unit output of cloth had not yet met the requirements of the plan. However, in order to complete the plan, they used the cloth accumulated in June to make up for the shortfall; the cotton yarn was bundled by the packaging workers overnight. The factory's leading cadres were not ashamed of this wrong behavior, but were proud and publicly praised and rewarded the packaging workers who worked overtime, and also formed a reporting team to report the good news to the North China Textile Administration Bureau.

In addition, when the production plan can be overfulfilled, the factory also adopts the method of laying an ambush, including the products of the previous month in the accounts of the next month to ensure the completion of the production task in the next month. On May 31, 1952, the first weaving workshop of the factory overfulfilled the production plan. The factory left more than 300 pieces of cloth that had been bundled to be put into the warehouse on June 1, and counted it as the output of June. On August 31 of the same year, when the first spinning workshop was rushing to bundle the August production task, because it was found that the August production task had been completed, it temporarily changed the package number of 21 pieces of yarn to September, and put it into the warehouse together with the products of August 31. The warehouse section also issued a receipt for September 1 on August 31. Last September, after the factory began to implement rhythmic production organized according to the instruction chart, the second and third weaving workshops, in order to bundle and put into the warehouse according to the output indicated by the chart, stopped bundling when the monthly excess reached a certain amount, and kept the products as inventory in the workshop. Therefore, in January of this year, the cloth accumulated in the workshop was 660 pieces more than in September of last year. This not only distorted the meaning of the production instruction chart and accumulated funds, but also seriously hindered the workers' enthusiasm for production. Because of the existence of false phenomena, the true picture of the entire enterprise's production is obscured, and progress and backwardness cannot be seen.

There are many other methods of making false reports in the factory. Some workshops often increase the labor intensity of workers to complete production tasks. In order to complete the task, some workshops deliberately send bad yarn to the cloth field to make up the numbers, and they have agreed that as long as the end of the month is over and the task is completed, the bad yarn can be returned (the output of yarn supplied by the yarn field to the cloth field is calculated according to the quantity of yarn sent to the cloth field. The bad yarn is returned by the cloth field to the yarn field and deducted from the output). In order to rush the task, some workshops do not care about the impact on the life of the machine. The cone winder does not wipe the machine on a periodic basis at the end of the month. In order to falsely report achievements, in the preparation workshop, the cone winder underreports the number of second-class products; in the yarn winding section, the recycled silk is mixed in the finished yarn balls, and the amount of recycled silk is not calculated according to the actual situation; in the cotton cleaning section of the first spinning field, cotton rolls exceeding or falling short of the standard weight are also counted as first-class products, so sometimes the rate of first-class rolls is as high as 100%.

The Second Cotton Textile Factory conducted two anti-falsehood campaigns in March 1951 and June 1952 under the unified arrangement of the North China Textile Administration Bureau; more than a dozen technical and management personnel in the factory were also administratively punished for making false reports. However, these two anti-falsehood campaigns did not completely solve the problem, and the false phenomena were not eliminated. Many leading cadres of the factory, such as the secretary of the Party branch, the director of the factory, and the chief engineer, still do not have a sufficient understanding of the serious harm that false phenomena cause to the people's enterprises.

    天津机织印染三分厂和第二棉纺织厂
    假报生产数字欺骗上级严重妨害生产
    天津地方国营机织印染三分厂所染的新华蓝布，去年八、九月份都没有完成生产计划，同时质量也很不好，质量最低时，正品率仅达到百分之四十一强，曾受到机织印染总厂领导方面的批评和指责。十月份，该厂解决了水源问题以后，日产量已由过去的六百多匹提高到八、九百匹。只要稍加努力，全月二万七千匹新华蓝布的任务就可以完成。该厂党支部书记孔繁祯认为过去完不成计划总受到领导上的批评，这次生产条件改善了，一定要超额完成计划，争得增产节约运动的锦标，以示“光荣”。但他们并未充分发动群众挖潜力、找窍门，以提高生产，提前完成任务。孔繁祯为了与兄弟厂争夺锦标，竟指使统计员黄永盛（该厂团支部的组织委员）假造报表欺骗上级，将十月二十七日统计日报表内实际入库量八百七十三匹新华蓝布，改为三千五百九十八匹；将实际打包九百包改为四千五百四十包；将实际拉宽一千三百五十三匹，改为二千三百五十三匹，并且还假造了正、次品的质量百分数。这样便将十月三十日才能全部完成的国家生产任务，假造成二十七日就全部完成了。报表假造完后，就向总厂“报喜”，声称提前四天完成国家任务。
    由于总厂领导方面存在着官僚主义作风，没有详细审查三分厂送来的统计日报表，只认为过去总批评三分厂，这次该厂既然提前完成计划了，就应该及早奖励，于是随便派了四个干部下厂了解情况。下厂的干部不负责任地查对了几张报表数字后，便打电话报告总厂说：“完全没错，确实完成计划了。”总厂就根据这个电话里的报告，把锦标颁发给了该厂。
    这件事情的经过，除了该厂财务工作人员了解以外，绝大多数职工都不清楚。该厂会计股长刘淑贞，从地方国营工业局开完会回厂，发现厂内计划完成的有些突然，心里发生怀疑。经他详细调查发现了计划提前完成是假造的，才勇敢地揭发了这个事实的真象。
    国营天津第二棉纺织厂也存在许多严重的虚假现象。例如：该厂为了假报成绩，在生产计划不能完成的时候，就采用加班加点，以下月产量顶上月产量的办法来“完成任务”。一九五二年四月份，该厂第二、三织布车间，单位产量虽完成了计划，但因为布匹没有及时打包入库，影响了全月生产任务的完成（按规定，布匹和棉纱都必须在打成包入库后，才算完成计划），打包工人就在五月一日休假日加班打包，将五月一日的产量计入四月份生产数字内。事后，华北纺织管理局批评了该厂领导干部这种缺点。但棉纺二厂领导干部仍继续采取弄虚作假的办法伪报完成任务。同年五月，全厂棉纱生产计划不能完成时，又在六月一日（星期日）加班打包二十支纱四十件，计入五月份生产数字内，报称五月份生产计划超额完成。同年七月，全厂纱、布又都不能完成计划，布匹单位产量还没有达到计划的要求。但为了完成计划，便利用六月份的积存的布匹补上了亏空；棉纱则由打包工人连夜加班。对这种错误的行为，该厂领导干部不以为耻，反而得意洋洋，公开表扬奖励加班的打包工人，还组成报喜队向华北纺织管理局报喜。
    另外，当生产计划能够超额完成的时候，该厂还采用打埋伏的办法，将上月份的产品计入下月份的账内，以保证下一月份生产任务的完成。一九五二年五月三十一日，该厂第一织布车间，布匹超额完成了生产计划，该厂就把已打成包的三百余匹布，留到六月一日入库，算作六月份的产量。在同年八月三十一日，第一纺纱车间赶着打包完成八月份生产任务时，因为发现八月份生产任务已经完成，就临时将二十一件纱，改刷九月份的包号，与八月三十一日的产品，同时收入库内，栈务科也就在八月三十一日开出了九月一日的收条。去年九月份该厂开始推行按指示图表组织有节奏生产以后，第二、三织布车间，为了按图表指示的产量打包入库，每月超额至一定数量，就不再打包，将产品作为盘存留在车间内，因此今年一月车间所积存布匹比去年九月多出了六百六十匹布。这样既歪曲了生产指示图表的意义，积压了资金，也严重妨害了工人的生产积极性的发挥。因为虚假现象的存在，整个企业生产的真实面貌被掩盖起来，进步和落后都看不出来了。
    该厂弄虚作假的方法还有很多。有些车间经常以提高工人的劳动强度来完成生产任务。有的车间为完成任务，故意把坏纱送到布场顶数，并且商量好，只要过了月底，任务完成后，就可以把坏纱退回去（纱场供应布场用的纱，产量是按纱送到布场的数量计算的，坏纱由布场退回纱场，并在产量中扣除）。有的车间为了赶任务，不顾对机器寿命的影响，筒子机到月末不按周期擦车。为虚报成绩，在准备车间，筒子机外卷次品，以多报少；在摇纱部分，将回丝夹在纱团成品内，不按实计算回丝数量；在第一纺纱场清花工段，棉卷超过或不足标准重量，也算正品，因而有时正卷率竟高达百分之百。
    棉纺二厂在一九五一年三月和一九五二年六月曾两次在华北纺织管理局的统一布置下，开展过反虚假运动；在该厂技术人员和管理人员中，还有十余人因为弄虚作假受到了行政上的处分。但是，这两次反虚假运动并没有彻底解决问题，虚假现象也并未消除。该厂许多领导干部如党总支书记、厂长及总工程师等对于虚假现象给人民企业的严重危害仍然认识不足。
