Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 28th: The Ceylon Embassy issued a statement to the press regarding the rubber negotiations between Ceylon and the United States. The statement condemned the United States for attempting to force Ceylon to accept American conditions in the rubber trade.

The statement pointed out that W. Averell Harriman, then the Mutual Security Agency Administrator under Truman, had criticized Ceylon because the rubber negotiations between the two countries had not produced an agreement. The statement continued, stating that at that time, the Ceylon government decided not to make any official comments on Harriman's accusations. However, the Ceylon government now believes the time is ripe to explain the reasons for the failure of negotiations between the United States and Ceylon, and the reasons why Ceylon later concluded an agreement with China.

The statement pointed out that as early as the London Conference in February 1950, the United States had vigorously attempted to gain international control over rubber. Ceylon participated in this conference. "The conference was doomed to failure because it was clear from the outset that rubber consumers wanted to purchase rubber at their own prices as much as possible, regardless of the interests of producers." The meeting adjourned under these circumstances and reconvened in Rome in April 1951.

At the same time, the United Kingdom, apparently with the consent of the United States (if not actually at the request of the United States), ordered a ban on the shipment of rubber from Malaya to "Communist countries."

The Ceylon government raised concerns about the possible adverse impact of such measures on the world rubber market, and emphasized that reasonable guarantees must first be provided to protect rubber interests before any embargo could be implemented.

By the time the rubber conference was held in Rome in April 1951, consumers had already benefited from this embargo control, as rubber prices had fallen due to the embargo. This conference also failed because producers and consumers failed to reach agreement on fundamental issues.

The statement mentioned the United Nations resolution prohibiting the export of "strategic" materials to China and North Korea, and the so-called "Kem Amendment," which aimed to reduce American "aid" to countries that trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. The statement then pointed out that in June 1951, the United States government suggested to Ceylon that it purchase a large amount of Ceylon rubber. The statement said: "The Ceylon government welcomed this suggestion, and negotiations began. The main difficulty hindering the agreement was the issue of price. The United States wanted to buy Ceylon rubber at the average price in Singapore, while the Ceylon government believed that the appropriate price should be the general price in the Colombo market. Since the United States was unwilling to discuss the matter further, these negotiations eventually stopped.

Despite the fact that the United States insisted that Ceylon sell its rubber at the Singapore market price, it is said that in the same month, the United States concluded an agreement with Thailand in which the United States agreed to purchase Thai rubber at the prevailing price in the "world market."

Judging from the subsequent negotiations between the United States and Ceylon, this contradictory attitude of the United States is even more puzzling.

On September 10, 1951, Ceylon appealed to the United States regarding the reasons why the "Kem Amendment" should not apply to Ceylon's rubber exports. Ceylon did so merely to show that Ceylon opposed the rubber embargo, rather than being afraid of losing American aid. In fact, Ceylon did not receive any noteworthy aid from the United States, although the two governments had signed an agreement in November 1950 providing Ceylon with technical assistance in accordance with the American Fourth Point Program."

The statement pointed out that the first batch of rubber shipped from Ceylon to China was shipped at the end of September 1951, and several batches were shipped subsequently.

Ceylon responded to all the opinions raised by the United States in this way:

"The Ceylon market is open, and the United States is free to buy rubber just like China. The Ceylon government cannot agree to blindly obey this embargo, because this would cause Ceylon obvious and unavoidable economic losses."

The statement continued, saying that in early January 1952, the Ceylon government again contacted the United States to begin negotiations on an agreement to purchase large quantities of Ceylon rubber.

The United States agreed to resume negotiations and put forward suggestions similar to those previously discussed. This time, the pricing standard again proved to be an insurmountable difficulty, and the United States rejected Ceylon's compromise pricing proposal. These negotiations failed. In order to reach an agreement with the United States, Ceylon finally sent a ministerial-level delegation to the United States last July, tasking this delegation with securing rice supplies for Ceylon and negotiating a rubber agreement.

The United States agreed to assist Ceylon in purchasing rice at competitive prices on the American open market, "but the United States government repeatedly refused to agree to purchase Ceylon rubber on the same principles."

The statement said: "These negotiations again did not achieve any results. During these negotiations, the United States government was aware that Ceylon intended to negotiate with the People's Republic of China to purchase Chinese rice, and may also discuss the sale of Ceylon rubber.

The first Ceylon trade delegation visited China in September 1952, and the second went to China in November 1952. In just one month, Ceylon concluded an agreement with China to purchase most of the rice it needed at reasonable prices and to sell a large amount of Ceylon rubber at prices higher than the general price on the Singapore market."

### 锡兰驻美大使馆发表声明  斥责美国企图压低胶价操纵锡兰橡胶贸易

    锡兰驻美大使馆发表声明
    斥责美国企图压低胶价操纵锡兰橡胶贸易
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿二月二十八日讯：锡兰大使馆向报界发表了锡兰政府关于锡兰和美国之间的橡胶谈判情形的声明，声明斥责美国企图强迫锡兰在橡胶贸易中接受美国的条件。
    声明指出，杜鲁门任内的共同安全署署长哈里曼曾指责锡兰，因为两国之间的橡胶谈判没有能产生什么协定。声明接着说，当时锡兰政府决定：官方对于哈里曼的指责不作任何评论。可是锡兰政府认为现在已到适当时机，可以向大家叙述美国和锡兰之间的谈判失败的缘故，和后来锡兰和中国缔结协定的缘故。
    声明指出，早在一九五○年二月举行伦敦会议时，美国就极力企图取得对橡胶的国际控制。锡兰参加了这次会议。“这次会议是注定要失败的，因为一开始就明显地看出来，橡胶消费者想以他们自己的价格尽量收购橡胶而毫不顾生产者的利益。”会议在这种情况下休会了，到一九五一年四月在罗马复会。
    同时，联合王国显然在美国的同意之下（如果不是实际上出于美国的请求的话），下令禁止橡胶从马来亚运往“共产党国家”。
    锡兰政府对于这样的步骤对世界橡胶市场可能发生的不利影响，提出意见，并且强调说，必须先提出合理的保证，保护橡胶利益，然后才能实行任何禁运。
    当一九五一年四月在罗马举行橡胶会议时，消费者已经得到这种禁运管制的好处，因为橡胶价格因禁运而下降了。这次会议又因生产者和消费者对于基本问题没有获致协议而失败。
    声明提到了联合国禁止向中国和北朝鲜输出“战略”物资的决议和旨在削减美国对那些跟苏联和人民民主国家贸易的国家的“援助”的所谓“克姆修正案”。声明接着指出，一九五一年六月，美国政府向锡兰建议要购买锡兰大宗橡胶。声明说：“锡兰政府对这个建议表示欢迎，于是谈判就开始了。阻碍协议的主要困难是价格问题。美国要以新加坡的平均价格来购买锡兰橡胶，而锡兰政府则认为适当的价格应该是科伦坡市场的一般的价格。由于美国不愿再谈下去，这种谈判终于停止。
    尽管美国方面硬要锡兰以新加坡市价出售它的橡胶，据说就在这一个月，美国却跟泰国订立了一个协定，美国同意以当时“世界市场”的一般价格购买泰国橡胶。
    从后来美国和锡兰的谈判情形看来，美国这种前后矛盾的态度，更是令人莫名其妙。
    一九五一年九月十日，锡兰曾向美国申述关于“克姆修正案”不能适用于锡兰橡胶输出的理由。锡兰这样做，无非是为了表明锡兰反对对橡胶禁运，而不是怕丧失美国的援助。事实上，锡兰并没有从美国得到值得一提的援助，虽说两国政府在一九五○年十一月曾签订了一个协定，规定依照美国的第四点计划给予锡兰以技术协助。”
    声明指出，锡兰运往中国的第一批橡胶在一九五
    一年九月底起运，以后又陆续运去了几批。
    锡兰对美国提出的所有意见都是这样答复的：
    “锡兰的市场是公开的，美国可以和中国一样地自由来购买橡胶。锡兰政府不能同意盲目服从这个禁运，因为这会给锡兰以十分明显的不可避免的经济损失。”
    声明接着说，一九五二年一月初，锡兰政府又和美国接洽开始举行关于购买大宗锡兰橡胶的协定的谈判。
    美国同意重新举行谈判，并提出类似以前曾经讨论过的建议。这次定价的标准又证明是不可克服的困难，美国拒绝了锡兰的定价的折衷建议。这次谈判失败了。锡兰为了要和美国取得协议，最后在去年七月还派了部长一级的代表团去美国，要这个代表团为锡兰取得大米供应并谈判一个橡胶协定。
    美国同意协助锡兰在美国公开市场上以竞争价格购买大米，“但是美国政府一再拒不同意以同样的原则去购买锡兰橡胶”。
    声明说：“这次谈判又没有获得任何成就。美国政府在这次谈判期间已知道，锡兰打算和中华人民共和国谈判购买中国大米，同时还可能讨论出售锡兰橡胶的问题。
    第一个锡兰贸易代表团在一九五二年九月访问中国，第二个在一九五二年十一月去中国。在短短的一个月以内，锡兰就和中国缔结了一项以合理价格购买锡兰需要的大部分的大米和以高于新加坡市场一般价格的价格出售锡兰大量的橡胶的协定。”
