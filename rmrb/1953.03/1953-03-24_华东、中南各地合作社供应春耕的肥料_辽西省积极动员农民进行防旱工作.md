Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 23rd: Supply and marketing cooperatives in East China have prepared to supply approximately 70% of the region's annual fertilizer supply plan for spring ploughing. The various fertilizers that have already been transferred and prepared have increased by 14% compared to the same period last year; the increase in miscellaneous fertilizers alone is 30%. Since the beginning of spring, cooperatives at all levels in Shandong Province have prepared 500 million jin of various fertilizers. As of early March, 124.4 million jin of oil cake, 4.4 million jin of chemical fertilizers, and 8.7 million jin of miscellaneous fertilizers had been supplied to farmers. When supplying fertilizers, cooperatives at all levels in Shandong Province also paid attention to the needs of wheat-producing areas and areas growing cash crops such as cotton.
To solve the problem of insufficient funds for fertilizer supply by supply and marketing cooperatives, some cooperatives have begun to carry out fertilizer pre-purchase work since last winter. In Zhejiang Province alone, the fertilizer pre-purchased by farmers through the mobilization of local supply and marketing cooperatives accounts for 52% of the currently prepared fertilizer; at the end of last year, the Fujian Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative mobilized farmers to pre-purchase fertilizers worth more than 5.6 billion yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, March 23rd: The Central South Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives plans to vigorously promote cotton cake in this year's spring ploughing fertilizer supply work.
Cotton is one of the main agricultural products of the Central South region, with an annual output of more than 3 million dan of cottonseed, the raw material for cotton cake. The benefit of promoting cotton cake is that not only can a large amount of cottonseed be fully utilized in agricultural production, but soybean cake can also be saved for feeding pigs, and the effect of using pig manure to fertilize fields is greater than that of soybean cake. In addition to containing sufficient fertilizer, cotton cake also has a bactericidal effect, and its use as fertilizer can reduce crop diseases and insect pests. The Central South Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives has instructed cooperatives in the Central South region to promote cotton cake by strengthening publicity and education in combination with technical guidance.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 23rd: The Sichuan Provincial People's Government has begun to issue various agricultural loans in a planned manner to help farmers with spring ploughing production. The scope of the loans includes seeds, fertilizers, pesticides for disease and pest control, farm tools, and food rations. Sichuan Province will issue a total of 240 billion yuan in agricultural loans this year, of which 140 billion yuan has already been loaned out.
In order to ensure the rational use of loans, the distribution work in various places is carried out under the unified leadership of the financial and economic committees of the people's governments at all levels, with the cooperation of agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, cooperatives, banks and other departments, and the procedures are simplified as much as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 23rd: The precipitation in Liaoxi Province last winter was less than in previous years, which threatens this year's spring ploughing and sowing with drought. To this end, the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government focused on arranging drought prevention work at the county magistrate meeting held in January. At present, the counties are actively mobilizing farmers to carry out drought prevention during the gap before spring ploughing. The river interception and ditch blocking projects completed in Liaozhong County have begun to store water, which can irrigate more than 12,000 hectares of dry land. Farmers in Panshan, Tai'an, Beizhen and other counties are also stepping up their efforts to dig wells, block rivers, and repair water bubbles. When the land had just thawed, various places mobilized farmers to level the land so that the land that had already shown signs of drought and was susceptible to drought could retain moisture for sowing. In order to do a good job in drought prevention, the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government has established an agricultural water conservancy office. The province plans to complete 73 river interception and water diversion irrigation projects, 28 canal irrigation projects, and 653 small reservoirs, ponds and water bubble irrigation projects; in addition, it will dig more than 26,890 wells and divert springs. After the completion of these projects, more than 100,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare) of dry land can be spared from the threat of drought.

    华东、中南各地合作社供应春耕的肥料
    辽西省积极动员农民进行防旱工作
    【新华社上海二十三日电】华东各地农村供销合作社已准备供应春耕的商品肥料约占全区全年肥料供应计划的百分之七十。现已调运妥当的各种肥料，比去年同期增加了百分之十四，只杂肥一种就增加了百分之三十。山东省各级合作社在入春以来，就准备了五亿斤的各种肥料。有一亿二千四百万斤油饼、四百四十万斤化学肥料和八百七十多万斤杂肥在三月上旬就已供应给农民。山东省各级合作社在供应肥料时还注意照顾了小麦产区和棉花等经济作物产区。
    为解决供销合作社供肥资金不足的困难，自去年冬季开始，部分地区的供销合作社展开了预购肥料的工作。仅浙江省各地供销合作社动员农民预购的肥料，占现已准备肥料数的百分之五十二；福建省供销合作社在去年年底就动员农民存实预购肥料达五十六亿多元。
    【新华社汉口二十三日电】中华全国合作社联合总社中南办事处计划在今年春耕供肥工作中大力推广棉饼。
    棉花是中南区的主要农产品之一，作为棉饼原料的棉籽年产约三百多万担。推广棉饼的好处，不但可把大量棉籽充分利用到农业生产上去，且可把豆饼节省下来喂猪，而用猪粪肥田效力比豆饼大。棉饼除含有充分的肥料外，还有杀菌的效能，用它作肥料，可减轻农作物的病虫害。中华全国合作社联合总社中南区办事处已指示中南区各地合作社，用加强宣传教育并结合技术指导的方法，来推销棉饼。
        【新华社成都二十三日电】四川省人民政府已开始有计划地发放各种农业贷款，帮助农民春耕生产。贷款范围包括种籽、肥料、防治病虫的药剂、农具、口粮等等。四川省今年将发放农业贷款共二千四百亿元，其中一千四百亿元已贷出。
    为了使贷款使用合理，各地发放工作是在各级人民政府财政经济委员会统一领导下，组织农林、水利、合作、银行等部门，分工配合进行，手续尽量简化。
    【新华社沈阳二十三日电】辽西省去冬降水量较往年为少，使今年的春耕播种受到干旱威胁。为此，辽西省人民政府在一月份召开的县长会议上着重布置了防旱工作。目前，各县正利用春耕前的间隙，积极动员农民进行防旱。辽中县修好的拦河、堵沟工程，已开始蓄水，共可灌溉旱田一万二千多垧。盘山、台安、北镇等县农民，也都加紧挖井、堵河、修水泡。各地在土地刚开冻时，便动员农民平整土地，使已呈旱象和易受旱灾威胁的土地，能保墒播种。为了做好防旱工作，辽西省人民政府已设立了农田水利办公室。全省计划完成拦河引水灌溉工程七十三处，修筑渠道灌溉工程二十八处，修小水库、池塘和水泡子等灌溉工程六百五十三处；另外还打井、引泉二万六千八百九十多眼。这些工程完成后，可使十万多垧（每垧十五市亩）旱田免除干旱威胁。
