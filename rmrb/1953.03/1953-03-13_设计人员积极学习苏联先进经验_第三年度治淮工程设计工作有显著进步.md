Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, March 12th. Design personnel participating in the Huai River project are actively studying advanced Soviet experiences and improving their work style, resulting in significant progress in the design work for the third year of the Huai River project.

When the Huai River harnessing project first began, due to the massive scale of the project, the urgency of the task, and the short time frame, many projects were designed and constructed simultaneously, and some were even constructed without any design at all. At that time, many designers were divorced from reality and acted rashly in planning and design. As a result, many projects suffered losses. For example, the old Wangpo flood storage project built in the upper reaches of the Huai River during the first year of the Huai River project suffered from flooding during construction because it blindly trusted the incomplete hydrological data left by the Kuomintang reactionary government and the design was not thorough enough. The Baisha Reservoir, built during the second year of the Huai River project, was built while being designed, so a fault in the water diversion tunnel was discovered during construction, which affected the progress of the project.

In the third year of the Huai River project, the Huai River command organs at all levels implemented the principles of "no construction without adequate preparation" and "no construction without proper design." Many designers accepted a series of advanced Soviet experiences in water conservancy construction, which greatly improved the level of design. The preparatory work before design was strengthened for all projects. The Nanwan and Boshan Reservoirs were repeatedly surveyed and measured, and drilling was conducted under the guidance of geological experts. The location and depth of the boreholes were more in line with standards than in the past. Design personnel also cooperated with survey personnel to investigate the hydrological conditions such as rainfall and flood water levels in the reservoir areas over the years with local farmers, and carried out soil tests, so that the designed engineering drawings could conform to the actual situation.

In the third year of the Huai River project, under the guidance of advanced Soviet design ideas, the design of each project was based on comprehensive benefits and saved the country's wealth. For the Nanwan and Boshan Reservoirs, attention was paid from the beginning to the current flood storage projects and future irrigation, shipping, power generation and other water conservancy projects, and unified planning and design were carried out. In designing the waterlogging control project for the Beifei River in the middle reaches of the Huai River, the planning was not only based on eliminating the waterlogging disasters in the 2,400 square kilometer Beifei River basin, but also on gradually changing this waterlogged area into an irrigated area. In designing the Runheji ship lock, Wangjiaba water inlet gate, and Donghu gate in the middle reaches of the Huai River, the design personnel, after repeated research, applied the elastic theory of soil to accurately calculate the anti-force distribution under the bottom slab of the gate, saving more than 90 tons of steel compared with similar culverts designed in the early stage of the Huai River project.

### 设计人员积极学习苏联先进经验  第三年度治淮工程设计工作有显著进步

    设计人员积极学习苏联先进经验
    第三年度治淮工程设计工作有显著进步
    【新华社蚌埠十二日电】参加治淮工程的设计人员积极学习苏联先进经验，改进工作作风，使第三年度治淮工程的设计工作有了显著的进步。
    根治淮河工程刚开始的时候，由于工程浩大、任务紧迫、时间短促，有不少工程一面设计，一面施工，有的甚至没有设计便施工了。当时，好多设计人员在规划设计时脱离实际，草率从事。这样，不少工程就受到了损失。如第一年度治淮工程中，在淮河上游所修建的老王坡蓄洪工程，就因为轻信国民党反动政府留下的残缺不全的水文资料，设计不够周密，所以施工时遇到了水灾。第二年度治淮工程中修建的白沙水库，因为边设计边施工，所以在施工中发现输水隧洞断层，影响了工程的进度。
    第三年度治淮工程中，各级治淮指挥机关执行了
    “准备不好不开工”、“设计不好不开工”的原则；许多设计人员接受了苏联在水利建设上一系列的先进经验，大大提高了设计水平。各项工程都加强了设计前的准备工作。南湾、薄山两水库都经过反复勘查、测量，并由地质专家指导钻探，钻孔的位置和深度就比过去合乎标准。设计人员并同时配合勘察人员到水库地区，向当地农民调查了水库区域内历年来的雨量、洪水水位等水文情况，作好土壤试验，使设计出来的工程图样都能符合于实际情况。
    第三年度治淮工程中，设计人员在苏联先进的设计思想指导下，每个工程的设计都能从全面效益出发，并节省了国家的财富。对南湾、薄山两水库，从开始就注意到水库目前的蓄洪工程和将来的灌溉、航运、发电等兴利工程，作了统一的规划、设计。在设计淮河中游北淝河的治涝工程时，不仅从消除北淝河流域二千四百平方公里的内涝灾害出发，而且还从有步骤地改变这一块内涝区为灌溉区出发作了规划。淮河中游的设计人员在设计润河集船闸、王家坝进水闸和东湖闸时，经过反复研究，应用土壤的弹性理论，精密地计算出闸底板下的抗力分布情况，比治淮初期设计的同类涵闸，节省了九十多吨钢筋。
