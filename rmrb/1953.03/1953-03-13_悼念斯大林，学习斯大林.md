    Mourning Stalin, Learning from Stalin
    (Speech at the memorial meeting for Comrade Stalin at the Marxist-Leninist Institute)
    Comrades,

    All the students and staff of our Marxist-Leninist Institute mourn our most beloved teacher and dearest friend, Comrade Stalin, with boundless grief.

    Comrade Stalin was the leader of the working class and all working people of the world. Throughout his life, he devoted all his energy and wisdom unreservedly to the communist cause of the world. Together with Lenin, he established the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union and led the Soviet working class and working people to the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, pointing out the road to victory for the working class and working people of the world. After Lenin's death, Comrade Stalin inherited the cause of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. He faithfully defended the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory and further developed and enriched Marxist-Leninist theory under new historical conditions. Comrade Stalin led the Soviet people to successfully build a socialist society and is victoriously carrying out the construction of a communist society to turn the most noble ideals of mankind into reality. Comrade Stalin led the Soviet people and all progressive mankind to achieve a glorious victory in the anti-fascist war, opening up a new chapter in world history.

    Comrade Stalin was infinitely kind to the Chinese people. The victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the name of Comrade Stalin, and inseparable from Comrade Stalin's guidance and assistance to the Chinese people's revolution. Comrade Stalin made extremely brilliant instructions on a series of basic issues of the Chinese revolution. He shattered the absurd remarks of the counter-revolutionary Trotskyites about the Chinese revolution and developed Lenin's theory on colonial and semi-colonial revolutions. Comrade Stalin's theory is the compass for the victory of the Chinese revolution. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Stalin, and the Soviet people and the Soviet government under his leadership, gave the Chinese people and the Chinese government sincere and generous selfless assistance. This assistance played an extremely important role in the recovery and development of the new China's economy and the consolidation of the country. The Chinese people will never forget Comrade Stalin's care and assistance to us. Comrade Stalin also paid great attention to the improvement of our party's theoretical work. He specially sent outstanding Soviet theoretical workers to our Marxist-Leninist Institute to help us train cadres in the theoretical front. All comrades of our Marxist-Leninist Institute will never forget Comrade Stalin's care and assistance to us.

    Comrades, in the process of studying Marxism-Leninism, we have deeply realized that all of Comrade Stalin's works are an inexhaustible treasure of Marxist-Leninist theory. Comrade Stalin gave a classic definition of Marxism: "Marxism is the science of the laws of development of nature and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, the Science of building a communist society." Comrade Stalin has made creative developments in all aspects of such rich content of Marxism. Comrade Stalin's diligent labor in theoretical work has advanced the development of Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. As Comrade Mao Zedong explained, Comrade Stalin's outstanding achievements in theoretical work have enabled the scientific thought of Marxism-Leninism to grasp the broadest masses of people in the world under the current historical conditions, and turned into the greatest force for changing the old world and creating a new world. Comrade Stalin's many brilliant scientific works such as "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course", "Foundations of Leninism", "Problems of Leninism", "Anarchism or Socialism?", "Marxism and the National Question", etc., have played an extremely important guiding role in the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people and the construction of the Chinese Communist Party, in the just struggle of the progressive cause of the people of the world and the construction of the Communist Parties of all countries in the world. Comrade Stalin's recent works left to us, such as "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics", "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and "Speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," have given us new and sharp theoretical weapons. We Chinese Communists have already drawn a lot of wisdom and strength from Comrade Stalin's works, and we must draw more wisdom and strength from Comrade Stalin's works to improve our Marxist-Leninist level and enhance our ability to build a new China and defend world peace. Comrades, as we mourn our great teacher Comrade Stalin with heavy hearts, we must seriously think about whether we are truly worthy of being ideological fighters under the banner of Stalin, and whether we have truly adhered to Comrade Stalin's precious teachings in all aspects. Comrade Stalin repeatedly emphasized that "the party's theoretical level must be raised to the required height," that "ideological work must be strengthened in all aspects of the party," and that extreme importance must be attached to "educating party members and party cadres in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and improving the political and theoretical level of the party and its staff." But here, some comrades do not regard the party's theoretical work and ideological work as matters of extreme importance like Comrade Stalin did, and they do not regard the educational work of Marxism-Leninism as a work that is decisive for the entire cause of the party. Comrade Stalin warned us: "If the propaganda work of our party is crippled for some reason, if the cause of educating our cadres with Marxism-Leninism weakens, if the work of improving the political and theoretical level of these cadres weakens, and these cadres themselves are therefore no longer concerned about the prospects of our progress, no longer understand the correctness of our cause, and become bureaucrats who blindly and mechanically execute the instructions of their superiors without any future, then the entire national and party work will inevitably weaken." Some of our comrades have read these words of Comrade Stalin, but they have not drawn the due conclusions from these words. However, since we have the opportunity to study Marxism-Leninism more systematically, no matter what work we will be engaged in in the future, we should regard strengthening the party's ideological work and strengthening the Marxist-Leninist education work for party members and cadres as our bounden duty, an irrefutable responsibility to the party.

    Comrades, we must follow Comrade Stalin's instructions, attach importance to ideological work, or engage in ideological work for life, and we must be proficient in Marxism-Leninism, especially Stalin's doctrine, because all of Comrade Stalin's works, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, are an encyclopedia of Marxism-Leninism. To be proficient in Marxism-Leninism and Stalin's doctrine, we must follow the method of mastering Marxism-Leninism that Comrade Stalin taught us earnestly, and resolutely oppose the dogmatic method of learning.

    Comrades, the great Comrade Stalin has bid farewell to us forever. In these sad days, we are determined to make greater efforts to carry out our studies and work, and truly cultivate ourselves to become good students of Comrade Stalin. Our great teacher Comrade Stalin is an example for us to learn from in all aspects. We must learn to use the weapons of Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism and historical materialism creatively to work and fight against our enemies like Comrade Stalin; learn to be ruthless to the enemies of the people like Comrade Stalin; learn to have an extremely profound spirit of principle like Comrade Stalin; learn from Comrade Stalin to have both a clear revolutionary future and purpose in our work, and a firm will to not stop until we reach our goal; we must learn Comrade Stalin's ideological qualities, learn Comrade Stalin's spirit of seeking truth from facts and humility and simplicity, as well as his style of maintaining close ties with the masses.

    Comrades, we must study Marxism-Leninism more diligently and unremittingly, study Stalin's doctrine, and learn to treat the party's ideological work and theoretical education work with the same attitude as Comrade Stalin.

    Comrades, in order to commemorate Comrade Stalin, we must also, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, unite more closely with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, strengthen our trust and support for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, and continue to learn from the Soviet Union sincerely. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, cultivated and taught by Lenin and Stalin, will always be the good teachers and helpful friends of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, and will always be the forerunners of progressive mankind in the world.

    Although our beloved teacher Comrade Stalin has passed away, his brilliant doctrine and immortal works will never leave us. The great cause of his life will forever shine in front of the working people and progressive mankind all over the world, inspiring people to continue to move forward. The immortal name of Comrade Stalin will forever live in our hearts.

    Long live the great and invincible doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin!

    Comrade Stalin will live forever!

    悼念斯大林，学习斯大林
    （在马克思列宁学院追悼斯大林同志大会上的讲话）
    杨献珍同志们：
    我们马克思列宁学院的全体学员和全体工作人员以无限悲痛的心情来哀悼我们最敬爱的导师和最亲切的朋友斯大林同志。
    斯大林同志是全世界工人阶级及一切劳动人民的领袖，他在一生中将自己的全部精力和智慧毫无保留地献给了全世界的共产主义事业。他和列宁一起，建立了伟大的苏联共产党，领导苏联的工人阶级、劳动人民取得了伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，给全世界工人阶级、劳动人民指引了走向胜利的道路。在列宁逝世后，斯大林同志继承了马克思、恩格斯、列宁的事业，他忠实地保卫了马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁性，而且在新的历史条件下进一步地发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义的理论。斯大林同志领导苏联人民胜利地建成了社会主义社会，并正在胜利地进行共产主义社会的建设，来把人类中的最崇高的理想化为现实。斯大林同志领导苏联人民和全体进步人类在反法西斯战争中取得了光辉的胜利，开辟了世界历史上的新的局面。
    斯大林同志对于我们中国人民是无限亲切的。中国革命的胜利是和斯大林同志的名字分不开的，是和斯大林同志对于中国人民革命的指导和援助分不开的。斯大林同志关于中国革命的一系列的基本问题曾作了极其英明的指示，他粉碎了反革命托洛茨基派关于中国革命的荒谬言论，发展了列宁关于殖民地半殖民地革命的理论。斯大林同志的理论是中国革命胜利的指南针。在中华人民共和国成立以后，斯大林同志和在他领导下的苏联人民、苏联政府，更给予了中国人民和中国政府以热诚的、慷慨无私的援助。这些援助对于新中国经济的恢复和发展及国家的巩固起了极其巨大的作用。我们中国人民将永远不会忘记斯大林同志对于我们的关怀和援助。斯大林同志同时还十分关怀我们党的理论工作的提高，他特地派遣了苏联的优秀的理论工作者到我们马克思列宁学院来帮助我们培养理论战线方面的干部。我们马克思列宁学院全体同志更将永远不会忘记斯大林同志对我们的这种关怀和援助。
    同志们，在学习马克思列宁主义的过程中，我们已经深刻地认识到，斯大林同志的全部著作就是马克思列宁主义学说的无尽宝藏。斯大林同志给马克思主义下了一个经典式的定义：“马克思主义是关于自然和社会的发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫被剥削群众革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学，是关于共产主义社会建设的科学”。对于马克思主义的这样丰富的内容的各个方面，斯大林同志都作了创造性的发展。斯大林同志在理论工作上的辛勤的劳作，把马克思列宁主义的发展推进到了一个新的阶段。正如毛泽东同志所说明的，斯大林同志的理论工作上的卓越成就，使得马克思列宁主义的科学思想在当前的历史条件下掌握了全世界的最广大的人民，化成了改变旧世界和创造新世界的最巨大的力量。斯大林同志的许多光辉的科学著作如“联共（布）党史简明教程”、“论列宁主义基础”、“论列宁主义的几个问题”、
    “无政府主义？还是社会主义？”、“马克思主义与民族问题”等等，对于中国人民的革命斗争和中国共产党的建设，对于全世界人民进步的正义的斗争事业和全世界各国共产党的建设，都起了极其伟大的指导作用。斯大林同志最近遗留给我们的“马克思主义与语言学问题”、“苏联社会主义经济问题”和“在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说”等等著作，更给了我们以崭新的锋利的理论武器。我们中国共产党人从斯大林同志的著作中已经吸取了很多的智慧和力量，我们还必须从斯大林同志的著作中吸取更多的智慧和力量，以提高我们的马克思列宁主义的水平，以增强我们建设新中国、保卫世界持久和平的本领。同志们，当我们抱着沉重的心情来悼念我们的伟大的导师斯大林同志的时候，我们必须认真地想一下，我们自己是否真配得上作一个在斯大林旗帜下的思想战士，是否真正做到在一切方面都是恪遵斯大林同志的可贵的遗训。斯大林同志曾反复强调“要把党的理论水平提到应有的高度”，要“在党的一切环节中加强思想工作”，要极端地重视“用马克思主义列宁主义精神来教育党员和党的干部，提高党及其工作人员的政治和理论水平的工作”。可是在我们这里，有些同志并不像斯大林同志那样把党的理论工作和思想工作看做是具有极端严重意义的事情，他们并不把马克思列宁主义的教育工作看作是对于党的全部事业具有决定意义的一项工作。斯大林同志曾这样警告我们：“如果我们党的宣传工作因某种原故而跛起脚来，如果用马列主义教育我们干部的事业衰弱下去，如果我们提高这些干部底政治和理论水准的工作削弱下去，而这些干部本身又因此而不复关心我们向前进展底前途，不复了解我们事业底正确性，而变成一些茫无前途，盲目式和机械式执行上级指示的事务主义者，那末我们全部国家的和党的工作，也就一定会衰弱下去。”我们有些同志虽然读过斯大林同志的这些话，但是他们并未从这些话中引导出应有的结论来。但是，我们既然有机会比较系统地学习马克思列宁主义，那末，不管我们将来担任什么工作，我们都应该把加强党的思想工作，加强对党员和干部的马克思列宁主义的教育工作看做是我们的一种天职，一种无可推诿的对党的责任。
    同志们，我们要遵循斯大林同志的指示，重视思想工作，或将终身从事思想工作，这就必须精通马克思列宁主义尤其要精通斯大林学说，因为斯大林同志的一切著作，正如毛泽东同志所说，乃是马克思列宁主义的百科全书。而要精通马克思列宁主义、斯大林学说，这就必须遵照斯大林同志所谆谆教导我们的精通马克思列宁主义的方法去学习，而坚决反对教条主义的学习方法。
    同志们，伟大的斯大林同志和我们永别了。在这悲痛的日子里，我们决心做更大的努力，来进行我们的学习和工作，把自己真正培养成为斯大林同志的好学生。我们的伟大导师斯大林同志在一切方面都是我们所要学习的榜样。我们要学习得像斯大林同志那样能够创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的武器来作工作，来同我们的敌人进行斗争；学习得像斯大林同志那样对人民的敌人毫不留情；学习得像斯大林同志那样有极深刻的原则精神；学习斯大林同志那样在工作中，既有明确的革命前途和目的，又有非达到目的不止的坚强意志；我们要学习斯大林同志的思想品质，学习斯大林同志的求实精神和谦逊朴素以及密切联系群众的作风。
    同志们，我们要更加努力不懈地学习马克思列宁主义，学习斯大林的学说，学习用斯大林同志那样的态度来对待党的思想工作和理论教育工作。
    同志们，为了纪念斯大林同志，我们还必须在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，更加紧密地和苏联共产党和苏联人民团结一致，要更加强对于苏联共产党和苏联人民的信任和支持，继续诚心诚意地向苏联学习。由列宁斯大林所培育和教导的苏联共产党和苏联人民永远是中国共产党和中国人民的良师益友，永远是全世界进步人类的前驱者。
    我们敬爱的导师斯大林同志虽然逝世了，他的天才的学说，不朽的著作，却永远不会离开我们。他的一生的伟大的事业将永远照耀在全世界劳动人民和进步人类的面前，鼓舞着人们继续前进。斯大林同志不朽的名字将永远活在我们的心里。
    伟大的、战无不胜的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说万岁！
    伟大的斯大林同志永垂不朽！
