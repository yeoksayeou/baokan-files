After the People's Daily held a symposium of medical and health workers on February 6 to study the medical and health problems of construction workers (details see page 2 of this newspaper on February 16), the Central Ministry of Health invited the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Labor, the Construction Industry Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau to study specific solutions on February 22 and 31. At the meeting, the Central Ministry of Health put forward several suggestions for solving this problem based on the content of the symposium on February 6 (they decided to implement the issue of organizing mobile medical teams in Beijing as a priority). They believe that after these methods have been tried out in Beijing for a period of time, they can start to solve problems in other regions.

Because these methods still need to be supplemented and revised based on the specific conditions of construction engineering, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Ministry of Health, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau have formed an investigation and research group to start work, and they plan to solve this problem before the start of construction in the spring. The following are several letters from readers regarding the solution to this problem.

Must Accelerate Bed Turnover Rate

A letter from the Medical Department of Peking University Hospital: After seeing the letters from some readers published in the People's Daily reflecting the lack of medical care for construction workers, our hospital comrades expressed their willingness to do everything possible to help construction workers solve this problem. However, there is a practical problem that requires the joint assistance of all parties, which is the issue of hospital bed turnover. Most of the serious injuries to construction workers are orthopedic. At present, there are very few orthopedic doctors and orthopedic beds in Beijing, and it is certainly not enough to complete the task of treating the injured and sick members of the increasingly large construction worker team with this force. However, even these insufficient facilities are not being fully utilized at present. The reason is that the bed turnover rate is too low. In 1949, the average length of stay for patients at Peking University Hospital was less than 20 days, but now it is about 30 days. The bed turnover rate in orthopedics is 110 days. According to our understanding, the average bed turnover rate in the Soviet Union is only 16 or 17 days. In contrast, we are not only far behind the Soviet Union, but also worse than in previous years.

The main reason for this situation is that the leadership of some organs is afraid of trouble, and pushes all responsibility to the hospital after sending patients to the hospital, and even the recuperation after the patient's initial recovery is left to the patient to solve by staying in the hospital. For example, Comrade Ma Jinduo from the Suiyuan Provincial Veterans Sanatorium came to our hospital in mid-September last year to treat spinal tuberculosis. Comrade Zhang Yuehua, who sent Comrade Ma to the hospital, promised to take him back as soon as he was able to leave the hospital for recuperation. Comrade Ma was able to be discharged in October of that year, but no one has come to pick him up yet. If this disease is recuperated until complete recovery, it will take at least a year to stay in the hospital, which will reduce the opportunity to treat a dozen or so serious injuries. In addition, a small number of patients are unwilling to be discharged even after the treatment period has passed. It is difficult for the hospital to persuade them, and the patient's leading organs need to assist in the solution.

The above reasons not only reduce the utilization rate of the hospital, preventing other patients from being admitted in time, but also turn the hospital into a sanatorium. What is serious is that other hospitals in Beijing also have similar situations. If the bed turnover rate of each of our hospitals can catch up with the Soviet standard, it will undoubtedly be able to exert greater medical capabilities, and the problem of construction workers can also be reduced to some extent. Therefore, we suggest that various organs establish or jointly establish sanatoriums or convalescent homes to solve the recuperation or convalescence problems of patients after discharge.

Establish Dedicated Health Management Organizations at Each Level

Letter from Qu Cheng: After seeing the letters from Comrades Juemin and Lanxiu and Comrade Qiunanxing published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on December 22 last year and the "Letters from Readers Special Page" on January 14 this year, reflecting the urgent need for medical solutions for construction workers in Beijing, Tianjin and other places, we feel that this problem is indeed in urgent need of solution.

To solve this problem, the health administrative organs should of course be primarily responsible. However, because there are many difficulties in solving it, and the injury and disease problems of construction workers also involve labor protection and environmental sanitation and other preventive work, I believe that the construction engineering department should vigorously assist the health administrative organs in solving this problem. However, in this regard, I think the construction engineering department has not done a good enough job in the past. According to my understanding, although many construction engineering departments have institutions specializing in the health problems of construction workers, due to the lack of regular leadership, the focus of work is not clear, and they only care about medical treatment and neglect preventive work. In order to better solve the medical problems of construction workers and strengthen the leadership of health services in the construction department, I think the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering should consider establishing dedicated health management organizations at all levels of construction authorities under its jurisdiction. These organizations can be under the dual leadership of the local health administrative organs and the superior health organizations of the construction department. In addition, I think that construction departments at all levels should also regard the health problems of workers as a task of their own department and include it in the annual and monthly plans, and check and summarize it together with other tasks.

Run Physician Training Classes to Train Intermediate Physicians

Letter from Bai Yangling: I am a nurse at the Beijing Municipal Third Hospital and also a student attending the physician training class at our hospital. My classmates and I have studied the problem of the lack of medical care for construction workers in various places, and we believe that in order to make the country's basic construction proceed faster, we should try our best to solve these difficulties of construction workers in a timely manner. We all agree with the opinions put forward by medical workers at the symposium published on page 2 of the People's Daily on February 16. However, because there is a general lack of medical personnel in the country now, and the medical personnel needed for basic construction will definitely be more in the future, we believe that we should also think of some ways to cultivate talents now. To solve this problem, it is not enough to rely solely on regular medical schools, because they are limited by conditions and cannot meet everyone's needs in terms of quantity. We believe that the health administrative organs should consider adopting a transitional method of systematically training nursing personnel and junior medical personnel to become specialist physicians (that is, training intermediate physicians). This transition method is very effective. For example, our Third Hospital's physician training class has achieved many results in the three months since it was opened. Our spare-time physician training class was established in mid-November last year. The students are selected from nurses and technicians with many years of work experience and relatively good skills. The teachers are experienced doctors from various departments. We have classes twice a week (three hours each time). In the first year, we learn basic medical knowledge such as histology, pathology, and anatomy. In the second year, we learn the basic theories of various specialties and conduct clinical practice in different departments. After the students complete their training and undergo a certain period of internship, they can serve as specialist interns or resident physicians.

    积极解决建筑工人医疗卫生问题
    本报于二月六日召开医务卫生工作者座谈会，研究解决建筑工人的医疗卫生问题后（详情见本报二月十六日第二版），中央卫生部曾于二月二十二日和三十一日先后邀请建筑工程部、劳动部、全国总工会建筑工会工作委员会、北京市公共卫生局等单位研究具体解决办法。会上，中央卫生部根据二月六日座谈会的内容，提出了几项解决这一问题的意见（关于组织巡回医疗队的问题他们决定尽先在北京试行）。他们认为：这些办法在北京市试行一个时期后，即可着手解决其他地区的问题。
    因为这些办法还需要根据建筑工程方面的具体情况作某些补充和修正，建筑工程部、卫生部、全国总工会，以及北京市公共卫生局等单位已组成调查研究小组，开始工作，他们准备在春季开工前解决这个问题。以下是有关解决这一问题的几封读者来信。
    必须加速病床周转率
    北大医院医务部来信：看到人民日报发表的某些读者反映建筑工人缺乏医疗的来信后，我们医院的同志们都表示愿意尽一切努力来帮助建筑工人解决这个问题。但有一个实际问题却需要各方面来共同协助，这就是医院病床的周转问题。建筑工人的重伤，多数是骨科。目前北京的骨科医生和骨科病床都很少，以这个力量来完成日益壮大的建筑工人队伍中的伤病员的医治任务当然不够。但就是这些不够的设备，目前还不能被充分地利用，原因就是病床周转率太低。北大医院在一九四九年时，病人的平均住院日不足二十天，而现在却是三十天左右。骨科病床周转率达一百一十天。据我们了解苏联的病床周转率平均只十六、七天。相形之下，我们不但远赶不上苏联，而且还不及前几年了。
    造成这种情况的主要原因，是某些机关的领导方面怕麻烦，把病人送到医院后就把责任全部推给医院，甚至病人初愈时的休养问题都让病人靠住医院来解决。如绥远省志愿军休养所马金铎同志在去年九月中旬来我院医治脊椎结核病，送马同志来院的张月华同志曾答应等他能够出院休养时，马上接他回去。马同志在当年十月就可出院了，但至今还没有人来接他。这种病若是休养到完全痊愈，起码还得住上一年，这样就会减少十几个重伤的医治机会。另外有少数病人，本身过了治疗期也不愿意出院。医院很难说服他们，需要病人的领导机关协助解决。
    上述原因不仅降低了医院的利用率，使其他病人不能及时入院，而且使医院变成了休养机构。严重的是：北京市其他医院也有类似情况。如果我们各医院的病床周转率都能够赶上苏联的标准，无疑就可以发挥更大的医疗能力；建筑工人的问题也就可以减少一部分。因此，我们建议：各机关自行建立或联合建立休养所或疗养院，以解决初愈病人出院后的休养或疗养问题。
    逐级建立卫生专管机构
    曲诚来信：看到去年十二月二十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏和今年一月十四日“读者来信专页”所载觉民、兰秀两同志和秋南行同志反映北京、天津等地建筑工人迫切要求解决医疗问题的来信后，我们觉得这个问题的确是急待解决的。
    要解决这个问题，卫生行政机关当然应该首先负责。但因解决起来有很多困难，而建筑工人的伤病问题又牵涉到劳动保护和环境卫生等预防工作，因此我认为在解决这个问题时，建筑工程部门应该大力协助卫生行政机关。但在这一方面，我认为建筑工程部门过去却作得不够好。据我了解：许多建筑工程部门虽然设有专管建筑工人卫生问题的机构，但因缺乏经常的领导，以至于工作重点不明确，只顾了医疗而忽视了预防工作。为了更好地解决建筑工人的医疗问题，加强建筑部门的卫生业务的领导，我觉得中央建筑工程部应该考虑在所属各级建筑主管部门中逐级建立卫生专管机构，这些机构可受当地卫生行政机关和建筑部门的上级卫生组织双重领导。另外，我认为各级建筑部门还应该把工人的卫生问题，作为本部门的一项工作，列在年度与月度的计划中，同其他各项工作一并检查，一并总结。
    开办医师训练班培养中级医师
    白杨灵来信：我是北京市立第三医院的护士，也是参加本院医师训练班学习的学员。各地建筑工人缺乏医疗的问题，我和同学们研究过，大家认为：为了使国家的基本建设进行得更快一些，我们应该想尽办法及时地解决建筑工人的这些困苦。我们都同意二月十六日人民日报第二版所载医务工作者在座谈会上提出的意见。但因现在全国普遍缺乏医务人员，而基本建设方面需要的医务人员今后一定会更多，因此，我们认为现在还应该从培养人材方面也想些办法。解决这个问题，单是依靠正规的医科学校是不够的，因为他们受条件的限制，在数量上不能满足大家的需要。我们认为卫生行政机关应该考虑采用有计划地培养护理人员和初级医务人员成为专科医师的过渡方法（即培养中级医师）。这种过渡方法，是十分有效的，如我们第三医院的医师训练班，开办三个多月来，已经收到很多成绩。我们的业余医师训练班，是在去年十一月中旬成立的，学员都是从有多年工作经验的护士长和技术比较优良的护士中选拔出来的。教师就是各科有经验的医生。我们每星期上两次课（每次三小时）。第一年学组织学、病理学、解剖学等医学基本知识。第二年学各专科基本理论并分科作临床实习。学员受训期满，再经过一定时期的实习，即可担任专科实习医师或住院医师。
