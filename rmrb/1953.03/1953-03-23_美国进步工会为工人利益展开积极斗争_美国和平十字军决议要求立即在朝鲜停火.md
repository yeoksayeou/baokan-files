　　Xinhua News Agency, 22nd Dispatch: TASS Moscow, 17th Dispatch: "Pravda" published an article by its New York correspondent, Litoshenko, describing the struggle of American progressive unions for the interests of workers.

　　The article said that American legislators, not satisfied with the Taft-Hartley Act, which oppresses labor, are now racking their brains to draft new, even more vicious bills to first destroy progressive unions.

　　Why does the American ruling clique hate these unions so much? The activities of one progressive union—the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers—can answer this question.

　　The American non-ferrous metal industry is almost entirely controlled by the Morgan family. In the fierce struggle with the powerful Morgan dynasty, the union has consistently demanded improved living conditions for workers. From 1945 to 1951, the union organized thirteen major strikes. In the first nine months of last year, metal miners held eight major strikes.

　　This union is also actively fighting for peace and civil rights. The union's leadership was one of the first American groups to condemn the bloody intervention of the American imperialists in Korea. At its congress at the end of last year, the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers passed a peace resolution calling for an immediate end to the Korean War, a peaceful settlement of all important outstanding issues between the great powers, a ban on atomic weapons, and the speedy reduction of armaments.

　　Litoshenko continued, the progressive unions’ activities in striving for peace and defending the vital rights and interests of the working class have aroused the fury of the American monopoly capitalist bosses and their union lackeys in the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.

　　In 1950, the corrupt clique of union bosses expelled eleven progressive unions, including the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, from the Congress of Industrial Organizations. They accused the leadership of the progressive unions of following a "communist line" by refusing to support the American imperialists' aggressive measures.

　　When the warmongers' partners in the unions failed in this conspiracy, they resorted to even more despicable means, attempting to split these unions from within, but they also failed. American government agents arranged dozens of illegal "elections" in local branches of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, but the lords of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations failed miserably every time. The workers wholeheartedly supported their legally elected leadership and their union.

　　Litoshenko concluded that American workers are paying more and more attention to the voices of peace and freedom. Progressive unions are their reliable defenders. That is why the American ruling clique's conspiracies to destroy the progressive union movement have failed one after another.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 22nd Dispatch: TASS New York, 19th Dispatch: The American Peace Crusaders recently held a peace conference in Chicago, which adopted a program to "unite and mobilize millions of Americans" on the issue of peace. The program stipulates: initiating a national movement to demand that the U.S. Congress immediately cease fire in Korea; state and local peace committees urging state and local legislatures to pass peace bills; delegations from across the country visiting the United Nations; demanding that the General Assembly continue to meet until an agreement to end the Korean War is reached.

　　According to the "Associated Press," a group called the "Minnesota Citizens Committee for Peace" issued a declaration demanding that Eisenhower agree to an immediate ceasefire in Korea. The declaration said that as soon as the Korean War ends, "we will demand that we get back to solving other problems at the United Nations, such as: the freedom of colonies, stopping the expansion of armaments, peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union, and the development of East-West trade."

    美国进步工会为工人利益展开积极斗争
    美国和平十字军决议要求立即在朝鲜停火
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：“真理报”发表驻纽约记者利托希科的一篇文章，叙述美国进步工会为工人利益而斗争的情况。
    文章说，美国议员们不以压迫劳工的塔夫脱—哈特莱法为满足，目前正在挖空心思地拟订新的、更为恶毒的法案，以便首先摧毁进步工会。
    美国统治集团为什么对这些工会如此痛恨呢？一个进步工会——开采、冶炼工人工会——的活动就可以答复这个问题。
    美国的有色金属工业几乎全部是由摩根家族控制的。工会在和有权势的摩根王朝进行的剧烈斗争中始终要求改善工人的生活条件。从一九四五年到一九五一年，工会组织了十三次大罢工。在去年头九个月中，五金矿工举行了八次大罢工。
    这个工会还积极为争取和平与民权而斗争。这个工会的领导机构是首先谴责美帝国主义者对朝鲜进行血腥干涉的几个美国团体之一。开采、冶炼工人工会在去年年底举行的代表大会上通过了一项和平决议，要求立即停止朝鲜战争，和平解决大国间一切重要的悬而未决的问题，禁止原子武器与尽速裁减军备。
    利托希科继续说，进步工会争取和平、保卫工人阶级切身权利和利益的活动，引起了美国垄断资本家老板们及其劳联和产联中的工会走狗们的暴怒。
    一九五○年，工会头子的腐朽集团把十一个进步工会驱出产联，其中包括开采、冶炼工人工会。他们指责进步工会的领导机构拒绝支持美帝国主义者的侵略措施是追随“共产主义路线”。
    当战争贩子在工会中的伙伴在这个阴谋上失败后，他们就采用更为卑鄙的手段，企图从内部来分裂这些工会，结果也失败了。美国政府代理人在开采、冶炼工人工会地方分会中布置了几十次非法
    “选举”，但是产联与劳联的老爷们每次都彻底失败了。工人们全心一致地支持他们合法选出的领导机构，并支持他们的工会。
    利托希科最后说，美国工人愈来愈专心注意和平与自由的声音了。进步工会是他们的可靠的保卫者。这就是为什么美国统治集团摧残进步工会运动的阴谋接二连三失败的原因。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约十九日讯：美国和平十字军日前曾在芝加哥举行和平会议，会议通过了在和平问题上“团结并发动千百万美国人”的纲领。这个纲领规定：发起一次全国性运动，向美国国会要求立即在朝鲜停火；各州与地方和平委员会促使各州与地方立法机构通过和平法案；全国各地推选代表团访问联合国；要求大会一直开下去，直到获得结束朝鲜战争的协议时为止。
    据“美联社”报道，有一个名叫“明尼苏达州公民争取和平委员会”的团体发表宣言，要求艾森豪威尔同意立即在朝鲜停火。宣言说，一俟朝鲜战争结束，“我们就要求重新着手解决联合国其他问题，例如：殖民地的自由，制止扩张军备，与苏联和平相处，发展东西贸易等”。
