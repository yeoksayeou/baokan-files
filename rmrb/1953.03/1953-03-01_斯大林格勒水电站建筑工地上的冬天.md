    Winter on the Construction Site of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station
    The weather in the Stalingrad area in late 1952 and early 1953 was changeable. After the continuous rains of the autumn of 1952, severe cold suddenly struck in the wind and snow sweeping across the land. But when the residents of Stalingrad were decorating their homes with festive lights and flowers to celebrate the New Year, it rained again, thawing the ice and making the hard ice on the Volga River soft and unstable. The materials for the construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, which were originally transported on the "Ice Road," could only be carried by icebreakers and ferries. However, after a few days, the cold returned, and the frozen Volga River once again became a traffic artery. Now, long convoys of trucks are traveling on this broad road.
    From the Volga River road, one can clearly see Beschyany Island, where the main force of the hydroelectric station builders is concentrated. In the center of the island, excavation and construction of the foundation pit are underway for the hydroelectric station building. The pipes of the suction dredgers are discharging a slurry of sand and water, which is being deposited on the embankments. In winter, the work of the suction dredgers is very difficult. Thick ice covers the transport pipes. The suction dredger workers are engaged in a heroic struggle with nature. They work day and night, regardless of the severe cold conditions. Millions of cubic meters of soil have been excavated from the foundation pit by the suction dredgers and deposited on the embankments. These suction dredgers are powerful. A suction dredger manufactured at the Stalingrad shipyard can dredge 6,000 cubic meters of soil per hour.
    Not far from the suction dredgers, a water-blocking dam stretches out. Its task is to prevent the intrusion of the Volga River during the spring flood season, so the builders are paying special attention to its solidity. They are building a steel barrier for the foundation pit here. The dam is protected by a series of steel walls facing the Volga River. These walls are composed of interlocking steel plates about half a meter wide. It takes a great deal of effort to drive these steel plates into the hard soil. However, an electric vibratory machine designed and manufactured by Soviet engineers has greatly simplified and accelerated this work. With the help of the electric vibrator, the steel plates are easily inserted into the soil, just as one cuts butter with a knife at mealtime. In just two or three minutes, the steel plate is inserted ten meters into the ground. The construction of this steel wall is very urgent and must be completed before the Volga River thaws and the spring flood season arrives, otherwise, the flood will wash away the embankment deposited by the suction dredgers and flow into the foundation pit. The builders on the construction site are now engaged in a competition to exceed their targets.
    In addition to this steel barrier, the foundation pit under the hydroelectric station building will also be surrounded by a waterproof belt. This waterproof belt will consist of six hundred pumps and seventy-eight waterproofing units with thousands of needle-like filters. By March, the waterproof belt will be put into operation to remove the water from the foundation pit, drying it out so that concrete can be poured and laid. Construction of the first concrete factory has already begun on the construction site. To produce large quantities of concrete, a large amount of gravel and sand is needed. These raw materials must be transported from the right bank of the Volga River to the left bank. Therefore, a suspension bridge more than one kilometer long will be built across the river. Now, many huge steel pillars, 132 meters high, are being manufactured on the right bank and Beschyany Island. This suspension bridge will be in use this year.
    Huge construction projects are also underway on the Volga River grassland near the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station. A 600-kilometer-long canal is being excavated between the Volga and Ural Rivers, which will irrigate millions of hectares of arid land in the semi-desert region. Many powerful excavators are now at work, including the "Uralets" excavator, giant walking excavators, and 25-ton dump trucks. One type of excavator can dig up 18 cubic meters of soil in a single bucket.
    A small town has sprung up near the hydroelectric station construction site on the left bank of the Volga River. Last year, sixty more buildings were built here. The small town now has ten streets. Many new shops and canteens have opened. Two primary schools have been built. Many new houses are also under construction. In the evening, construction workers go to clubs and cinemas, read books and newspapers in the library, attend lectures at the technical palace, or study in training courses, night schools, and amateur art groups. Not long ago, an art exhibition was held in this small town. At the exhibition, the builders and their families displayed their elaborate works – sculptures, embroidery, and more.
    On the construction site of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, whether it is day or night, hot summer or bitterly cold winter, people's labor is always intense, and life is always joyful. (Attached picture)

    斯大林格勒水电站建筑工地上的冬天
    在斯大林格勒一带，一九五二年年末和一九五三年年初的冬天的气候是变化无常的。在一九五二年秋季连绵的阴雨以后，严寒就在席卷大地的风雪中突然袭来，而当斯大林格勒城内的居民们在家里装饰起火树银花庆贺新年的时候，却又下起雨来，使冰雪解冻，坚硬的伏尔加河上的冰层变得松软而不结实了。原来在“冰面大道”上运送的建设斯大林格勒水电站的器材，只能用破冰船和渡船来运载了。但是，过不了几天，寒冷又卷土重来，于是冻结得硬硬的伏尔加河，重又成了交通大道。现在，在这条宽广的大道上正行驶着一长列一长列的运货汽车。
    从伏尔加河的大道上，人们可以很清楚地看到别斯恰纳依岛，水电站建设者们的主力正集中在这个岛上。在岛的中心，正在水电站建筑物下面进行基坑的挖掘与修筑工作，吸土机的管子正在排送出砂土和水混合在一起的泥浆，并把它们冲积在横堤上。在冬季，吸土机的工作是很困难的。厚厚的冰层覆盖着输送管。吸土机的工作人员们正在和自然进行英勇的斗争。他们不顾严寒的条件，日日夜夜地进行工作。吸土机从基坑内掘出并冲积在横堤上的泥土已有几百万立方公尺。这些吸土机是强有力的。在斯大林格勒造船厂制造的一种吸土机，每小时能够吸土六千立方公尺。
    离吸土机不远的地方，伸展着一条堵水的堤坝。它的任务是要防止日后春汛期间伏尔加河河水的侵入，因此建设者们特别注意它的坚固性。他们在这里修筑了基坑的钢铁屏障。在面临伏尔加河的地方，堤坝被一连串的钢墙防护着。这种墙壁是由宽约半公尺的连锁钢板组成的。把这种钢板钉入坚硬的土内，需要费很大的力气。但是由苏联工程师所设计制造的一种电力振动机器，却大大地简化了与加速了这一工作。钢板借电力振动机之助，很轻快地就插入土内，就好像人们在进餐时用刀子切牛油一样，只需二、三分钟，钢板就插入离地十公尺的土内。建筑这种钢墙铁壁的工作是十分紧急的，必须在伏尔加河解冻与春汛期以前把它们完成，不然的话，洪水就会冲坏由吸土机所冲积起来的堤坝，流入基坑。现在工地上的建筑者们正在展开竞赛，争取超额完成任务。
    除了这种钢铁屏障以外，水电站建筑物下面的基坑还要用防水带围绕起来。这种防水带将由六百个唧筒和带有数千个针状滤过器的七十八个防水设备组成。到三月间，防水带将开始动用，把基坑内的水清除出去，使基坑干燥起来，以便浇灌与铺设混凝土。现在在工地上已开始建设第一个混凝土工厂。为了大量生产混凝土，需要大量的石子和砂土。这些原料要由伏尔加河的右岸运到左岸去。因此，要在河上建筑一条长达一公里以上的吊桥。现在，高度为一百三十二公尺的许多巨大钢柱正在右岸和别斯恰纳依岛上制造着。这座吊桥将在今年使用。
    在斯大林格勒水电站附近的伏尔加河的草原上，巨大的建设工程也正在进行。伏尔加河与乌拉尔河之间正在开凿一条长达六百公里的大运河，这条运河将对半沙漠地带的数百万公顷的干旱土地进行灌溉。现在许多强大有力的掘土机正在工作，其中有“乌拉尔人”掘土机，巨大的走动掘土机和载重二十五吨的自卸卡车。有一种掘土机的槽斗一次就可以掘出十八立方公尺的泥土。
    伏尔加河左岸的水电站建设工地附近，已出现了一个小城镇。去年，在这里又修盖了六十所楼房。现在这座小城已有了十条大街。许多新的商店、食堂都已开张。两所小学已经盖好。许多新的住宅也在兴建中。一到晚上，建设工人们有的到俱乐部与电影院去，有的到图书馆去阅览书报，有的到技术宫去听演讲，或在讲习班、夜校和业余艺术小组去学习。不久以前，这座小城镇里举办了一次艺术展览会。在会上，建设者们和他们的家属们把自己的精心作品——雕刻、刺绣等展览出来。
    在斯大林格勒水电站的建筑工地上，不管是黑夜还是白天，是炎热的夏天，还是酷寒的冬季，人们的劳动始终是紧张的，生活始终是愉快的。（附图片）
