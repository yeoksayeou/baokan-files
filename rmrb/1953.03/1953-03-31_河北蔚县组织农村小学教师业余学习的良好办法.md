Hebei Province's Weixian County uses methods such as after-hours study groups, mobile libraries, professional communication networks, and correspondence courses to organize all primary school teachers in the county to study. This experience provides preliminary good methods for solving the problem of after-hours study for rural primary school teachers.

In order to improve the cultural level and teaching skills of primary school teachers, the Weixian County People's Government, starting in 1950, focused on the county's third district and piloted three learning forms: professional communication network, after-hours study groups, and mobile libraries, to organize primary school teachers in various villages in the district to study. Under the unified leadership of the county and district study committees jointly formed by the county People's Government's Culture and Education Section and the Education Trade Union, the county normal school served as the key learning general station, and the district complete primary school served as the learning branch station. Below the district level, each village's central primary school served as the base station, and each station had a dedicated person responsible for inspection and supervision. The professional communication network, after-hours study groups, and mobile libraries established by each station organized the county's scattered primary school teachers into a common learning organization to study. For example, the Daiwangcheng Complete Primary School branch station in the county's third district was divided into six central school districts, and each school district established an after-hours study group. The 53 teachers participating in the study joined the nearby after-hours study groups. The after-hours study groups used the Chinese language and arithmetic materials from the Beijing Correspondence Normal School as the main textbooks, following the principle of teachers learning what they teach and mastering one subject thoroughly. Teachers chose one or two subjects to study. The after-hours study groups had attendance, leave, and transfer systems, as well as democratic activities such as meetings, self-criticism, and homework checks. In addition to gathering at the after-hours study groups for half a day every Sunday, each teacher also studied independently for one hour each day. The station's mobile library had more than 900 books. These books were divided into six parts, distributed to each after-hours study group, and rotated for teachers to borrow. If teachers encountered difficult problems in their studies that the study group could not solve, they used messengers and postal mail to submit the questions level by level through the professional communication network to the branch station and general station. In the past three years, primary school teachers in the third district have raised a total of 420 questions, all of which have been answered.

After the success of this after-hours advanced study method in the third district, Weixian County promoted this learning experience to all villages in the county. In October 1952, the Beijing Correspondence Normal School conducted a correspondence learning experiment based on the county's after-hours study groups, gradually combining the above three learning forms with correspondence learning. Teachers who were organized to study not only overcame the past phenomenon of unsystematic learning and learning independently, but also gradually developed good habits of self-study and collective learning in the process of being organized to study, improved their political awareness and cultural level, and enhanced their teaching confidence. Many teachers, after systematic study of Chinese language and arithmetic, greatly improved their cultural and professional level. In the past three years, in the third district alone, 57 primary school teachers were promoted to primary school principals, directors of teaching affairs, promoted from junior class teachers to senior class teachers, and other cultural and educational work cadres, accounting for more than 95 percent of the original number of teachers in the district at the beginning of liberation. The number of teachers participating in the study throughout the county has increased from only 53 initially to more than 750 now. Teacher Lü Xiong used to be unable to engage his students because he didn't understand teaching methods. Since he learned how to organize teaching, his teaching performance has been very good and he has been rated as a study model for the entire district. (Xinhua News Agency)

    河北蔚县组织农村小学教师业余学习的良好办法
    河北省蔚县运用业余学习班、流动图书室、业务通讯网以及函授学习等方法，把全县小学教师组织起来学习，这一经验为农村小学教师解决业余学习问题提供了初步的良好办法。
    蔚县人民政府为了提高小学教师的文化水平和教学业务水平，从一九五○年起，以该县三区为重点，试用业务通讯网、业余学习班和流动图书室等三种学习形式，将该区各村小学教员组织起来学习。在县人民政府文教科和教育工会共同组成的县区学习委员会的统一领导下，以该县师范为重点学习总站，以区完全小学为学习分站。区以下以各村中心小学为基点站，各站都有专人负责检查和督促。由各站成立的业务通讯网、业余学习班和流动图书室，把全县分散的小学教员组织到一个共同的学习组织里学习。如该县三区代王城完全小学分站，下面共划分成六个中心学区，每一学区成立一个业余学习班。参加学习的五十三名教员，就分别参加到附近业余学习班学习。业余学习班是根据北京函授师范学校的语文和算术为主要教材，本着教师教什么学什么、学一科精一科的精神，由教员选一科或两科学习。业余学习班都有点名、请假、转学等制度，又有会议、检讨和检查作业等民主生活。教师们除每星期日集中到业余学习班学习半天外，每人每日还自修一小时。该站的流动图书室共有九百多本书。这些图书分成六部分，分配到各个业余学习班，供教员轮流交换借阅。教师在学习中的疑难问题，学习小组不能解答时，用便人捎信和邮寄的方式，经过业务通讯网，逐级提往分站、总站。三年来三区小学教师共提出了四百二十个问题，都得到了解答。
    这种业余进修的方法，在三区取得成绩后，蔚县就将这一学习经验推广到全县各村。一九五二年十月，北京函授师范学校又在该县业余学习班的基础上，进行了函授学习的实验，使上述三种学习形式又逐渐和函授学习结合起来。组织起来学习的教师，不但克服了过去东抓一把西抓一把和学习自流的现象，而且教员们在组织起来的学习过程中，还逐渐养成了自学和集体学习相结合的良好学习习惯，提高了政治觉悟和文化水平，并增强了教学信心。许多教师经过系统的语文和算术的学习以后，文化和业务水平都有很大的提高。三年来仅三区的小学教师在学习以后，被提升为小学校长、教导主任、由初级班教师提升为高级班教师和其他文教工作干部的就有五十七人，占该区解放初期原有教员人数的百分之九十五以上。全县教员参加学习的，最初只有五十三人，现在已有七百五十多人。教员吕雄过去因不懂教学法，学生听课没有兴趣。自从他学习了组织教学的方法以后，教学成绩很好，已被评为全区学习模范。   （新华社）
