    Must Learn Soviet Design Ideology
    Li Songtang, Chief Engineer of the Anshan Iron and Steel Design Institute
    Having participated in the actual work of the large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, which were aided by the Soviet Union in their design, I deeply realized the superiority of Soviet design and my own corrupt bourgeois technical viewpoints.
    In 1950, Soviet experts came to Anshan Iron and Steel to collect original data. At that time, I still had a considerable amount of bourgeois technical thinking and had varying degrees of resistance to all the requirements of the Soviet experts in collecting original data. I thought at the time that in capitalist countries, design companies or manufacturers could handle everything when contracting a project without needing much advice from others. Now that Soviet experts have come to Anshan Iron and Steel, they are asking for this and that before anything has even started, which is really too much trouble. Now I realize what is different between the original data required for design in socialist construction and that required in capitalism. Here is an example: Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary government ordered a small iron and steel plant from a German company. At that time, the contractor only required a square piece of flat land as original data for the construction site. This was indeed convenient for the client, as it did not require soil analysis, hydrology, or geological drilling data, nor did it require ground building or topographical data, or even a detailed map. However, such a large square piece of flat land required for an iron and steel plant is impossible to find in mountainous or hilly areas, and it is not easy to find even in plains. To achieve this goal, it would be necessary to destroy some forests, farmland, and existing buildings, and a large amount of earth and stone excavation and filling would be required. Now the Soviet experts are asking us for a great deal of original data, including soil analysis, hydrological surveys, geological drilling data, as well as ground buildings, topographic maps, and detailed plan views; if it is a renovation of a factory, even more is required. This may seem troublesome to the client, but in fact, if designed based on the above original data, a suitable construction site and correct soil bearing capacity can be selected, thus greatly reducing the amount of earth and stone excavation and filling, saving the amount of steel and concrete used in equipment foundations and building foundations, and effectively utilizing the original buildings and preserving trees that are not easy to grow, creating a good green environment for the new factory. Wouldn't this be more reasonable than first removing all the original trees and buildings on the ground, creating a flat land, and then re-excavating and filling earth and stone and deepening the foundation to remedy the shortcomings caused by the lack of original data? But at that time, I emphasized the busy production work and handed over the important work of collecting original data to trainee technicians without even checking it myself. I remember one particularly prominent thing very clearly: the large rolling mill originally had a chimney that the Soviet experts wanted to use in the design, but because the data provided was incorrect, it had to be stated in the technical design that the chimney was too small and had to be rebuilt. Later, the Soviet experts re-measured it on site and proved that the diameter and height of the chimney were fully in line with the design requirements. We almost demolished this perfectly suitable chimney simply because we did not measure it accurately when collecting the data.
        In 1951, a large number of Soviet experts arrived in Anshan to prepare for the review of the preliminary design. After listening to the Soviet experts' report on the content of the preliminary design, the impression of blind production in capitalism immediately appeared in my mind, and I naturally raised two points of opinion on the design: First, the entire design lacked a comprehensive finished product warehouse; Second, the expansion part of the metal heat treatment plant only had one production system, and thus could not make full use of the original equipment. Regarding the first question, if analyzed from the perspective of the social system, it is not difficult to understand why the Soviet design is completely different from what I thought: The characteristic of economic construction in socialist and new democratic countries is planned production based on the needs of national economic development, production for need, not blind commodity production like in capitalist countries. Therefore, finished products will not be overstocked, and there is naturally no need for a large finished product warehouse. As for why the Soviet design adopted a single production system for the expansion part of the metal heat treatment plant, it is also not difficult to understand if analyzed from the difference in production methods: In socialist and new democratic countries that carry out planned production, a production variety plan has already been formulated before starting to design a factory. Different finished products are produced by different equipment, and there is no need to make one piece of equipment have multiple functions. This can improve equipment utilization, simplify the production system, reduce management costs, and lower production costs. Conversely, in capitalist countries, in order to meet market needs, it is best for each piece of equipment to be able to perform a variety of productions, and the performance of the equipment cannot be made singular. It is not difficult to see that the reason why I advocated using two production systems instead of one production system is a reflection of the capitalist mode of production in the design thinking.
    Another characteristic of Soviet design is the effort to improve workers' working conditions and welfare facilities, especially manifested in a large amount of mechanization and the adoption of perfect heating and ventilation equipment. For example, in large rolling mills, from heating, rolling, sawing, printing, cooling, straightening, finishing to the entire process of leaving the factory, the operators only need to stand on dozens of operating consoles and press the electric buttons or pull the switches of the compressed air and hydraulic systems, and the steel parts will automatically move forward according to the prescribed process. For example, for printing work, the adoption of automatic printing not only saves physical labor, but also allows the smelting furnace number to be correctly stamped on the rolled finished product, so that when a failure occurs at any location and at any time, the name of the steel production factory and the smelting furnace number can be found, so as to clarify responsibilities and improve work. Another example is the automatic quenching of steel rails, which makes them of excellent quality, prolongs the life of steel rails and vehicles, and also reduces the clicking sound made by vehicles every time they pass through the joints of two steel rails. In capitalist countries, sometimes mechanization is also used locally, but that is entirely to reduce wage expenditures in order to pursue higher profits. If capitalists believe that using manual labor instead of machinery is more profitable, they will never use mechanized equipment. At the same time, workers are afraid of losing their jobs and are unwilling to use new machines. Therefore, the development of mechanization is subject to certain restrictions in capitalist countries. As for heating and ventilation equipment, its main role is to create suitable working conditions for workers and machines. In capitalist countries, some will be used to protect machines; but for the protection of the human body, if it violates the principle of pursuing profit, it will never be used. However, in the design of the two major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, a large amount of heating and ventilation equipment was used. The steam used for heating in winter in the two projects alone consumes about 16 tons per hour. This steam is low-pressure steam drawn from high-pressure steam turbine generators and does not require a dedicated boiler. The total amount of water consumed per hour to reduce air temperature in summer is nearly a thousand tons, and this cooling water is used for production after use and will not cause waste.
    In addition, in terms of construction design, such as the extremely strict requirements for the center line, the one-time pouring of the foundation, and the establishment of various processing plants, it plays an important role in accelerating the speed of capital construction and achieving "good," "fast," and "economical." However, when I began to implement these advanced construction methods, I had various resistant thoughts. For example, regarding the problem of one-time concrete pouring, I was once dominated by corrupt technical thinking and discussed with experts on behalf of the technical personnel whether it could be changed to two or three pours. The experts also agreed to this opinion and selected foundations that were more suitable for multiple pours for trial; but the results of the experiment showed that doing so was too slow, so everyone felt that one-time pouring was better. This shows how difficult the ideological transformation of technical personnel from the old society is, and also shows how important the ideological remolding of technical personnel is in the new era of economic construction.
    Now I deeply realize that if an engineering and technical personnel wants to serve the people loyally, he must unconditionally implement the suggestions of Soviet experts and sincerely learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in actual work. Because the advanced experience of the Soviet Union summarizes all the latest achievements of science and has more than 30 years of rich construction experience. At the same time, only under the unique superior conditions of the Soviet socialist system can the wisdom and creativity of the working people be highly developed. Therefore, the Soviet Union can constantly produce experiences that are far more advanced than all capitalist countries. It is certain that China's economic construction is to follow the path of Soviet socialist economic construction. Only by humbly and earnestly learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can an engineering and technical personnel serve the people on the correct road.

    必须学习苏联的设计思想
    鞍钢设计处总工程师　李松堂
    参加了由苏联帮助我国设计的鞍钢大型轧钢和无缝钢管两项工程的实际工作，使我深切地认识到了苏联设计的优越性和自己的资产阶级的腐朽的技术观点。
    一九五零年，苏联专家到鞍钢搜集原始资料，当时我还存在着相当浓厚的资产阶级技术思想，对苏联专家搜集原始资料的一切要求，都具有不同程度的抗拒情绪。我当时认为，在资本主义国家，设计公司或厂商承包一项工程时，可包办一切而毋须主顾问事。今天苏联专家到鞍钢来，事情还未办，就先要这样、要那样，实在太麻烦。现在我才认识到社会主义建设中的设计与资本主义的设计所需要的原始资料究竟有什么不同。下面就是一个实例：解放前，国民党反动政府曾向德国某公司订建一个不大的钢铁厂，当时承包人对于厂地建筑的原始资料只要求有一块方形平地。这对订货人来说，倒的确省事，既不要土壤分析、水文、地质钻探资料，也不要地面建筑物及地形资料，甚至连比较详细的地图都不要。但是一个钢铁厂所需要的这样大的方形平地，不要说在山岳或丘陵地带不可能找到，就是在平原地带也是不容易找到的。要达到这个目的，就必须破坏一些林木农田和已有的建筑物，并需大量地挖填土石方。而现在苏联专家向我们要的原始资料是非常多的，包括土壤分析、水文调查、地质钻探等资料及地面建筑物、地形图和详细的平面图等；如果是改建的厂，则要求的更多。这对订货人来说，好像很麻烦，而实际上如根据以上的原始资料设计，可以选择适当的建筑用地和正确的土壤耐压力，因而将大量减少土石方的挖填量，节省设备基础与建筑物基础的钢筋混凝土用量，并可以有效地利用原有的建筑物和保留不易成长的林木，给新建的工厂造成优良的绿化环境。这样岂不是比先将地面原有的林木与建筑物全部去掉，造成一块平地后，再重新挖填土石方和加深基础，以补救因无原始资料所造成的缺点要来得更合理些。但当时我却强调生产工作忙，而将搜集原始资料的重要工作交给见习技术员去做，自己也不检查。有一件特别突出的事，我还记得很清楚，就是大型轧钢厂原有一个烟囱，苏联专家在设计时很想利用，但由于供给的资料不正确，所以在技术设计书内不得不载明因烟囱过小必须改建。后来，苏联专家又重新实地测量，证明烟囱的直径和高度与设计所需要的完全符合，就因为我们搜集资料时没有测量准确，险些将这个完全合乎需要的烟囱拆掉了。
        一九五一年，大批苏联专家到达鞍山，准备进行初步设计的审核工作。当我听了苏联专家报告的初步设计的内容以后，资本主义盲目生产的印象立即在我脑子里浮现出来，很自然地就对该项设计提出了两点意见：一、整个设计中没有全面性的成品仓库；二、金属热加工厂的扩充部分只有一个生产系统，因而不能尽量利用原有的设备。关于第一个问题，如果从社会制度上来分析，就不难理解苏联的设计为什么和我所想的一套完全不同：社会主义和新民主主义国家经济建设的特点，是根据国民经济发展的需要进行计划性的生产，是为需要而生产，不是像资本主义国家那样进行盲目的商品生产，因而成品不会积压，当然也就不需要有庞大的成品仓库。至于金属热加工厂的扩充部分，为什么苏联设计采用一个生产系统呢？只要从生产方式的不同来加以分析，也是不难理解的：在进行计划性生产的社会主义和新民主主义国家，动手设计一个工厂之前，就已经制订了生产的品种计划，不同的成品分别由不同的设备来生产，不必使一种设备具有多种性能。这样可以提高设备运用率，简化生产系统，减少管理费用与降低生产成本。相反的，在资本主义国家，为了适应市场的需要，每种设备最好都能进行多样性的生产，而不能使设备的性能单一化。不难看出，我之所以主张采用两个生产系统而不赞成一个生产系统，就是资本主义生产方式在设计思想上的反映。
    苏联设计的另一个特点，表现在尽力改善工人的工作条件和福利设施，特别表现在大量机械化及采用完善的暖气通风设备上。例如在大型轧钢厂，自加热、轧制、锯断、打印、冷却、矫正、精整一直到出厂的全部工序，操作的工人只须站在几十个操纵台上，按动电扭或扳动压缩空气及水压系统的开关，钢件即按着规定的工序自动向前进行。如打印工作，采用自动打印后，不仅节省体力劳动，并且由于可以将冶炼炉号正确地用钢字打在轧好的成品上，无论在任何地点、任何时间发生故障时，均可查出该项钢材的生产厂名及冶炼炉号，以便明确责任、改进工作。又如钢轨自动淬火，使成为品质优良，延长了钢轨及车辆的寿命，还可以减轻车辆在每经过两根钢轨接头时所发出的咯答咯答的声音。而在资本主义国家，有时也局部采用机械化，但那完全是为了减少工资的支出，以追求更高的利润。如资本家认为用人工代替机械更有利可图时，就绝不会采用机械化的设备。同时工人怕失业，也不愿使用新式机器。所以机械化的发展，在资本主义国家是受到一定限制的。至于暖气通风设备方面，其主要作用是给工人与机器造成适当的工作条件。在资本主义国家，为了保护机器，有时还会采用一些；而对于保护人身，如果违反了追求利润的原则，那是绝不会使用的。但在鞍钢两大工程的设计中，暖气通风的设备大量被采用，仅两个工程冬季用于取暖的蒸汽，每小时就约消耗十六吨。这些蒸汽是自高压蒸汽透平发电机抽出来的低压蒸汽，并不需要专设锅炉。夏季用以降低空气温度的总耗水量，每小时将近千吨，而这项冷却用水，使用后即转用于生产，并不会造成浪费。
    此外，在施工设计方面，如要求极为严格的中心线、基础的一次浇灌，以及各种加工厂的设立等，对于加快基本建设的速度，做到“好”、“快”、“省”，是起着重要作用的。但开始实行这些先进的施工方法时，我却存在着各种抗拒思想。例如对混凝土一次浇灌问题，我曾经受着腐朽的技术思想的支配，代表技术人员与专家商议是否能改为两次或三次浇灌。这个意见专家也答应了，并挑选出比较宜于多次浇灌的基础试作；但试验的结果，这样做太慢，于是大家又都觉得还是一次浇灌好。这说明了来自旧社会的技术人员的思想转变是如何的困难，也说明了在经济建设的新时期，技术人员的思想改造是如何的重要。
    现在我更深切地认识到：一个工程技术人员要想忠诚地为人民服务，就必须在实际工作中无条件地贯彻苏联专家的建议与真诚地学习苏联的先进经验。因为苏联的先进经验，总结了一切科学的最新成就，并有三十多年建设的丰富经验，同时，只有在苏联社会主义制度特有的优越条件下，劳动人民的智慧与创造才能够得到高度的发展。所以在苏联就能不断地出现远较一切资本主义国家更为先进的经验。肯定地说，中国的经济建设是要走苏联社会主义经济建设的道路的。只有虚心、认真地学习苏联先进经验，才是一个工程技术人员为人民服务的正确道路。
