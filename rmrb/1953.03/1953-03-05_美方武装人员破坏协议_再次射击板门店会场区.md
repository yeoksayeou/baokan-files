Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th: Between 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM on March 2nd, dozens of armed personnel under US control fired upon the Panmunjom conference area with light machine guns and other weapons, once again seriously violating the agreement between the two sides regarding the conference area. On the same afternoon, security officers from both sides conducted a detailed four-hour investigation, with irrefutable evidence and witnesses, leaving the US side no room for denial. On February 10th, armed personnel under US control intruded into the conference area and set fire to it. On February 12th, they injured one of our military police officers in the conference area. The US side has yet to provide an explanation for these two incidents, and instead has created an even larger provocation. Sources here point out that the US side's continuous creation of such incidents is clearly aimed at accelerating the situation so that the security of the conference area cannot be maintained, thereby achieving the goal of completely disrupting the negotiations. During the joint investigation on March 2nd, witnesses unanimously pointed out that the armed personnel under US control had fired more than 50 bullets at the conference area, including tracer bullets. The sounds of the shooting were clearly those of American-made M1 carbines and American-made light machine guns. When the shooting occurred, our security officers were patrolling the conference area in a jeep and were also fired upon. Five or six bullets passed by the jeep, while the US security personnel stationed in the conference area hid in tents and completely ignored the situation. On the edge of the conference area where the shooting occurred, US armed personnel hurriedly left behind an American-made hand grenade while retreating. On the sandy beach of the Sajok River near the conference area, they left many clear footprints leading to the US military positions. Security officers from both sides examined this physical evidence together. On February 10th and February 12th, US armed personnel also sneaked into the conference area through this area. The investigation clearly shows that this incident is a further conspiracy by the US side to sabotage the conference area in an organized and planned manner.

    美方武装人员破坏协议
    再次射击板门店会场区
    【新华社开城四日电】三月二日上午二时到三时之间，美方控制下的武装人员数十名，以轻机枪等武器向板门店会场区射击，又一度严重地破坏了双方关于会场区的协议。同日下午，双方安全军官共同进行了四小时的详尽调查，人证物证确凿，不容美方抵赖。二月十日美方控制下的武装人员曾侵入会场区放火，二月十二日又在会场区打伤我方军事警察一名。对这两次事件，美方至今未作交代，却相反地制造了规模更大的一次挑衅。此间人士指出：美方连续制造这类事件，其目的显然是要加速促使会场区的安全不能维持，从而达到完全破坏谈判的目的。在三月二日的共同调查中，证人一致指出美方控制下的武装人员曾向会场区发射子弹五十多发，其中还包括泄光弹多枚，射击的声音清楚地是美式卡宾枪“M1”式步枪和美式轻机枪的声音。在射击发生时，我方安全军官乘吉普车在会场区内巡视，竟也遭到射击，有五、六发枪弹从吉普车旁掠过，而当时美方驻会场区的治安人员却藏在帐篷中完全不理。在发生射击地区的会场区边缘，美方武装人员在撤退时仓皇地遗下了美制手榴弹一枚，会场区附近砂川河的沙滩上，他们留下了许多清晰的通向美军阵地的足印。双方安全军官一同查看了这些物证。二月十日及二月十二日美方武装人员也是经过这个地区潜入会场区的。调查清楚地表示：这一次事件是美方有组织、有计划破坏会场区的进一步阴谋。
