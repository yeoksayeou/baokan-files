Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 27th: The Vietnam News Agency reports that in February, Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Vietnamese Labor Party, delivered an important report at a joint meeting of the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly and the National Committee of the Vietnamese National United Front, entitled: "Fully Mobilize the Masses in 1953 to Thoroughly Implement the Land Policy."

The report first analyzed the nature of the Vietnamese revolution, stating: Our national and people's democratic revolution is an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution. Its task is to defeat the imperialist aggressors, eliminate the remnants of feudal exploitation, and realize national liberation and "land to the tiller."

The driving force of the revolution is the people led by the working class. The vast majority of the people are peasants. Therefore, the essence of the national question is the peasant question. The nature and foundation of the national liberation issue are the land issue.

The report pointed out the collusion between imperialism and reactionary feudal forces, and the close relationship between the struggle against imperialist aggressors and the struggle against reactionary feudal forces, and then stated that our current urgent task is: to intensify preparations for a general counter-offensive, to intensify the war of resistance until complete victory. We should strengthen the people's strength, especially the strength of the peasants. We should more clearly formulate a land policy and thoroughly implement this policy.

The report then pointed out the shortcomings of the current land policy and proposed the following revisions:

	(1) Rent reduction should have retroactive effect. Landlords who have not reduced rent from the date of promulgation of the decree should return the excess rent to the peasants.
	(2) Strictly implement interest rate reductions in accordance with government decrees.
	(3) The land of French colonialists and Vietnamese traitors should be definitively distributed to poor peasants, rather than temporarily distributed as is currently the case. Those who receive land shall enjoy definite ownership of these lands.
	(4) All public and semi-public land should be distributed to peasants. Puppet soldiers can also receive land, but only after they return to the motherland.
	(5) Land belonging to landlords who have fled to still-occupied areas and land belonging to absentee landlords should be temporarily distributed to peasants for cultivation, just like cultivating their own land. Wasteland should be distributed to peasants.

After discussing the methods for implementing the land policy, the report pointed out that fully mobilizing the masses is the basic method for implementing the land policy.

Mobilizing the masses is a great movement. Its purpose is to defeat reactionary forces, weaken the economic power of the feudal system, and crush its political power in the countryside; partially satisfy the economic demands of the laboring peasants, and strive to establish the political dominance of the basic masses in the countryside; consolidate peasant organizations, consolidate local people's political organs, consolidate and expand the national united front in the countryside, and strengthen the production movement and the war of resistance.

The report concluded: Fully mobilizing the masses to thoroughly implement the land policy is the basic task at present, and it is very timely to carry out this work this year. It is hoped that all political parties, people's organizations, democratic人士, and people from all walks of life within the Vietnam United Front will unite and actively participate in this work to win a great victory for the war of resistance and the people.

    越南劳动党总书记长征作了重要报告
    号召今年全面发动群众彻底实行土地政策
    【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南劳动党总书记长征二月间在越南国民大会常务委员会和越南国民联合战线全国委员会的联席会议上，作了一项重要报告，题目是：“在一九五三年全面发动群众彻底实行土地政策”。
    报告首先分析越南革命的性质说：我们的民族和人民民主革命是反帝反封建的革命。它的任务是要打垮帝国主义侵略者，消灭封建剥削势力的残余，实现民族解放和“耕者有其田”。
    革命的动力是工人阶级领导的人民。人民中绝大多数是农民。因此民族问题的实质就是农民问题。民族解放问题的性质和基础就是土地问题。
    报告指出帝国主义和反动封建势力的狼狈为奸，又指出反对帝国主义侵略者的斗争和反对反动封建势力的斗争之间的密切联系，然后说，我们目前急迫的任务是：加紧准备总反攻，加紧进行抗战，直到完全胜利。我们应该加强人民的力量，特别是农民的力量，我们应该更明确地制订土地政策，并彻底地执行这个政策。
    报告接着指出现行的土地政策的缺点，提出下列的修正办法：
    （一）减租要有追溯的效力。从法令公布的那一天起，还没有减租的地主应该把超过的地租退还给农民。
        （二）严格依照政府的法令实行减息。
    （三）把法国殖民者和越南卖国贼的土地确定地分配给贫农，而不是和现在一样地暂时分配。分得土地者对这些土地享有确定的所有权。
    （四）把所有公地和半公地分配给农民。伪军人也可以分得土地，但必须是在他们回到祖国以后。
    （五）属于那些逃到还被侵占地区的地主的土地以及属于不在地主的土地，应暂时分给农民耕种，和耕种他们自己的土地一样。把荒地分配给农民。
    报告在论述关于实行土地政策的方法之后指出：全面发动群众是实行土地政策的基本方法。
    发动群众是一个伟大的运动。它的目的在于打垮反动势力，削弱封建制度的经济力量，粉碎它在乡村的政治力量；部分满足劳动农民的经济要求，争取建立基本群众在乡村中的政治统治地位；巩固农民组织，巩固地方人民政权机关，在乡村中巩固和扩大民族联合战线，加强生产运动，加强抗战。
    报告最后说：全力发动群众来彻底执行土地政策，是目前的基本任务，在今年进行这件工作是很适时的。希望越联战线内的一切政党、人民组织、民主人士和各界人民团结一致，积极地参加这项工作，为抗战和人民争取伟大的胜利。
