The Ministry of Construction Engineering Suffers Serious Waste of Design Resources Due to Frequent Changes in Building Plans by Entrusting Units

[Report from our newspaper] Due to the fact that various units entrusting the Ministry of Construction Engineering with building projects are too late in issuing tasks, and most of them fail to provide the necessary design information in a timely manner, the vast majority of design units under the Ministry of Construction Engineering are unable to carry out design work smoothly, resulting in numerous rework, which seriously wastes design resources. Moreover, due to delays in design, most projects cannot start on schedule, which will inevitably lead to a large amount of idle labor.

The Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has received a total of sixty new engineering design tasks, but only one project has a planned task book, while the entrusted building units require them to start designing immediately. This has resulted in the following serious consequences:

	One, because there is no planned task book, the cost, address, area, architectural form, etc. of the project are unknown, making it impossible to start designing. Therefore, the vast majority of designers in the design institute have had nothing to do since January.

	Two, because designs are started without a planned task book, the plan is often changed during the design process, resulting in a lot of rework, which seriously wastes design resources. For example, the First Ministry of Machine Building entrusted the Ministry of Construction Engineering to design the 752 Factory in the autumn of last year. The area was more than 60,000 square meters, and they required the drawings to be submitted by the end of February this year, urging it very tightly. In order to complete this task, the design institute organized more than 70 people, who started work successively from September last year, spending 4,762 working hours and more than 100 million yuan in expenses. However, in late January this year, the First Ministry of Machine Building wanted to change the plan, and the design had to be stopped. The engineering design of the First Military Medical University also started in July last year, with a construction area of 37,000 square meters. The original plan was to submit the drawings by the end of March this year, and 3,280 working hours had been spent to complete the design of the sketches. Later, the plan was changed again, and the completed designs had to be scrapped and redone. Another example is a school of the Navy Command, whose original plan was for a 50,000-square-meter building project, which also started designing in July last year. During the design process, due to changes in the plan, there were several reworks. By the beginning of February this year, sketches of 18,000 square meters and construction drawings of more than 36,000 square meters had been completed. Finally, the plan changed again, and all these drawings were scrapped, wasting more than 2,000 working hours. The original plan for the construction project of the Liaison Bureau of the Asian-Australian Trade Unions was for a three-story building, but when the drawings were submitted for review, it was changed to six stories, and now it has to be redesigned. Many similar examples can be cited. According to the statistics of the Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, in January and February of this year, the institute should have worked more than 146,600 hours, but due to idle work and rework, 63.7% of the working time was wasted, and the construction of 187,800 square meters of building projects was reduced.

	Three, the failure to complete the design on time has greatly affected the completion of the state's construction plan. This year, the design institute has a total of 90 building engineering design tasks (including 24 carry-over projects), with a total design area of 1.06 million square meters. They originally planned to complete the design of 250,000 to 300,000 square meters in the first quarter. According to the existing strength, this plan was sure to be completed. However, because design data could not be obtained in time and a large amount of rework was caused by changes in the plan during the design process, the plan has now had to be reduced to 180,000 square meters. Because the design cannot be completed on time, it will inevitably cause a serious waste of construction forces. For example, the directly affiliated engineering company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Beijing Construction Engineering Company (the two units have now been merged) have prepared a total of 75,000 construction workers this year, including 21,000 permanent workers, 33,000 contract workers, and 21,000 temporary workers. The construction season is approaching, and these workers will be reporting to work soon. However, because the design department cannot deliver the drawings quickly, most projects cannot start on schedule. In the three months of March, April, and May this year, an average of 60,000 people in these two companies will be idle for half a month. This will result in a total of 900,000 working days of idle work, delaying about 150,000 square meters of construction projects. At a wage of 20,000 yuan per person per day, the state will lose 180 billion yuan. At the same time, if work is idle in the first half of the year, the tasks will be piled up in the second half of the year, and there may be a rush to work in the second half of the year. This will also affect the quality of the project.

In order to change the above serious situation, the Ministry of Construction Engineering is now negotiating with the responsible persons of various entrusted building units, requiring them to quickly determine the construction site, form, cost, and other issues so as to start the design quickly; at the same time, they are required to strictly abide by the basic construction procedures, submit the planned task book within a limited time, and resolutely avoid rework. In the Ministry of Construction Engineering itself, it is prepared to continue to strengthen the design force, improve design efficiency and design quality, and strive to submit the drawings for the designs that can be carried out as soon as possible, and to use standard drawings in large quantities; in terms of construction, it is prepared to actively negotiate with relevant parties to find ways to adjust the existing labor force, and strive to avoid or reduce idle work.

    建筑工程部因委托建筑的单位常变动计划
    设计力量浪费非常严重
     【本报讯】由于委托中央建筑工程部进行建筑工程的各单位下达任务太迟，又大都不能及时提供设计的必需资料，中央建筑工程部所属绝大部分设计单位，都不能顺利进行设计工作，返工的很多，严重地浪费了设计力量。并且由于设计推迟，绝大部分工程不能按期开工，势将造成大量窝工现象。
    中央建筑工程部设计院一共接到了六十件新的工程设计任务，其中只有一件工程有计划任务书，而各委托建筑单位就要求着手设计。这样，就造成了下面的严重后果：
    一、因为没有计划任务书，工程的造价、地址、面积、建筑形式等等都不知道，无从着手设计，因此设计院绝大部分设计人员从一月份以来就没有事情做。
    二、因为没有计划任务书就设计，在设计中途，计划就常常变更，于是很多设计返工，设计力量浪费非常严重。如第一机械工业部在去年秋季委托建筑工程部设计的七五二工厂，面积有六万多平方公尺，要求在今年二月底交出图纸，催得很紧。设计院为了完成这个任务，组织了七十多人，从去年九月份陆续开始工作，已经用了四千七百六十二个工作小时，用去经费一亿多元。到今年一月下旬，图纸将要交出的时候，第一机械工业部却要改变计划，设计只好停止了。第一军医大学的工程设计，也是从去年七月份就开始的，建筑面积为三万七千平方公尺，原计划在今年三月底交出图纸，已经用了三千二百八十个工作小时，完成了草图的设计；后来计划又改变了，已经做好的设计只好废了重做。再如海军司令部的一个学校，原计划五万平方公尺的建筑工程，也是从去年七月份起就开始设计。设计中途，因为计划变更，返工了好几次，到今年二月初已完成了一万八千平方公尺的草图和三万六千多平方公尺施工图，最后，计划又变了，这些图纸竟全部作废，浪费了二千多个工作小时。亚澳工会联络局建筑工程原计划为三层楼，等到绘好了图送审时，又改变为六层，现在只得重新设计。像这样的例子还可以举出很多。据中央建筑工程部设计院统计，该院今年一、二两个月中，应该工作十四万六千六百多小时，但由于窝工和返工，即浪费了百分之六十三点七的工作时间，少做了十八万七千八百平方公尺的建筑工程。
    三、由于设计不能按时完成，使国家建设计划的完成受到了很大影响。设计院今年共有九十件建筑工程设计任务（其中二十四件为跨年度工程），设计面积共一百零六万平方公尺。他们原计划在第一季度完成二十五万至三十万平方公尺的设计，按照现有力量，这个计划有把握完成；但因为不能及时得到设计资料和设计过程中因计划改变而大量的返工，现在已不得不把计划压低到十八万平方公尺。因为设计不能按时完成，势将造成施工力量的严重浪费。例如中央建筑工程部直属工程公司和北京市建筑工程公司（两单位现已合并）今年共准备了七万五千个建筑工人，其中固定工二万一千人，合同工三万三千人，临时工二万一千人。施工季节即将来临，这些工人最近都要纷纷报到。但由于设计部门不能很快交出图纸，绝大部分工程都不能按期开工，这两个公司在今年三、四、五月三个月中，平均有六万人要窝工半个月。这就共将窝工九十万个工作日，耽误十五万平方公尺左右的建筑工程。以每人每日工资二万元计算，国家就要损失一百八十亿元。同时，上半年窝工，任务都堆到下半年，下半年又可能抢工。这样，又要影响工程质量。
    为了改变上述严重状况，现在中央建筑工程部正和各委托建筑的单位负责人协商，要求他们赶快确定建筑地皮、形式、造价等问题，以便迅速着手设计；同时要求他们严格遵守基本建设程序，限期提出计划任务书，坚决避免返工。在建筑工程部本身，则准备继续加强设计力量，提高设计效率和设计质量，争取把现在可以进行的设计尽快交出图纸，并大量采用标准图；施工方面则准备积极地和有关方面协商，设法调整现有的劳动力，争取不窝工或少窝工。
