    Northeast Electric Power Bureau Audits Basic Construction Plans of Subordinate Units
    Cuts Some Projects, Saving Over 50 Billion Yuan in Investment
    The Northeast Electric Power Bureau, in auditing the 1953 basic construction plans of its subordinate units, criticized the thought of "all undertakings flourishing" and "being eager for quick success and great achievements," cut some erroneous projects, and saved 55.4 billion yuan in investment.
    This plan audit revealed that the thought of "all undertakings flourishing" among some cadres was quite serious and stubborn. Here are a few prominent examples:
    There was an existing substation in Nanling, Changchun, which was damaged by the enemy during the Liberation War. This time, the Changchun Electric Power Bureau proposed to spend a huge sum of 6.27 billion yuan to repair it. The reason given was that the voltage of the local water company was low, and the substation needed to be repaired to supply power to the water company. Later, the design unit investigated and proved that the voltage was not low enough to hinder the water company's water supply. Moreover, other substations had surplus capacity and could be mutually adjusted if necessary. The Changchun Electric Power Bureau then argued that they were afraid of occasional line failures affecting the power supply to the water company. In fact, the solution to this problem should be to strengthen line protection work, without the need to repair a substation. Based on the above situation, this project plan was obviously wrong. However, a responsible cadre of the Changchun Electric Power Bureau even instructed the bureau's personnel participating in the plan audit in Shenyang to adhere to the erroneous opinion. For example, the Liaoyang Electric Power Bureau has a line over ninety kilometers long. Because the electricity consumption in a certain area served by this line increased, the bureau took the opportunity to propose to the higher authorities that the "poles were decaying" and the line was "unusable." They wanted to build a double-circuit line and replace all the wooden poles with iron towers (the country is currently short of this kind of steel). The design unit also did not conduct an on-site investigation, only verbally inquired about the "unusable" situation, and then made the engineering design. The entire project would cost 37 billion yuan. During the audit, the dispatch personnel of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau pointed out that this line was very usable because it had been repaired in 1950 and inspected and repaired in 1952. The poles had been treated with preservatives and could be used for at least twenty years. As long as the original line is used and a single-circuit line is added, the problem of increased electricity consumption in a certain area can be solved. The total project cost would only be 17 billion yuan, a reduction of 20 billion yuan compared to the original plan. For example, the Anshan Electric Power Bureau sent people to the higher authorities three times to request approval to replace a certain thirty-kilometer-long line. The reason given was that the line had "decayed wooden poles," "thin wires," and "many joints," fearing that it would affect power transmission. In fact, this line could still be used with only minor repairs and replacement of decayed wood and bad wires. After repeated persuasion by the Northeast Electric Power Bureau, the Anshan Electric Power Bureau abandoned the original project plan and formulated a new plan. According to the new plan, the total expenditure was only 450 million yuan, a 90% reduction in project costs compared to the original plan.
    Of the eleven projects audited this time, five were cancelled, two of which could be undertaken by production investment, saving 23.7 billion yuan. The content of three projects was reduced, or the original construction plan was changed, saving 22.7 billion yuan. Delaying the installation of major equipment and reducing unnecessary equipment saved 9 billion yuan. This ensured that basic construction investment was concentrated on the construction of major projects.

    东北电业局审核所属单位基本建设计划
    削减部分工程项目节省投资五百余亿元
    东北电业管理局在审核所属单位一九五三年基本建设计划中，批判了百废俱兴好大喜功的思想，削减了一些错误的工程项目，节省了五百五十四亿元的投资。
    这次审核计划中，暴露出部分干部的百废俱兴思想是相当严重和固执的。下面是几个突出的例子：
    长春南岭原有一座变电所，在解放战争时遭敌人破坏，这次长春电业管理局提出要用六十二亿七千万元的巨资把它修复起来。理由是当地自来水公司电压低，要修复这座变电所供应自来水公司用电。后来设计单位去调查，证明电压并未低到妨害自来水公司供水的程度。而且其他变电所的电容量有富裕，必要时也可以互相调剂。长春电业管理局跟着又提出怕线路偶而发生故障，影响向自来水公司供电。其实，解决这个问题的方法，应该是加强线路保护工作，无须修复一座变电所。根据上述情况看，这项工程计划显然是错误的。但是长春电业管理局一位负责干部，竟指令该局在沈阳参加审核计划的人员坚持错误的意见。再如辽阳电业管理局有
    一条九十多公里长的线路，因为某地通过这条线路的用电增加，该局便趁机向上级提出“电杆腐朽”，线路“不堪利用”，要建立双回线，并将全部木杆改装为铁塔（目前国家正缺少这种钢材）。设计单位也没有实地调查，只在口头上询问了一下“不堪利用”的情况，就作了工程设计。全部工程需要三百七十亿元。在审核时，东北电业管理局调度人员指出，这条线路是很可以利用的，因为在一九五○年修理过，一九五二年也检查修理过。电杆经过防腐处理，至少能用二十年。只要利用原有线路，增加一条单回线，就能解决某处用电增加的问题。全部工程费用只要一百七十亿元，比原计划减少二百亿元。再如鞍山电业管理局曾三次派人向上级要求批准换掉某条三十公里长的线路。理由是这条线路“木杆腐朽”、“电线细”，“接头多”，怕影响送电。事实上，这条线路也是只要略加修理，换掉朽木、坏线，依然可以利用的。经东北电业管理局反复说服，鞍山电业管理局才放弃原来的工程计划，拟订了新的计划。按照新的计划，全部开支仅四亿五千万元，比原计划的工程费减少了百分之九十。
    这次审核的工程共有十一项，取消的有五项，其中有两项是可由生产投资举办的，节省了二百三十七亿元，削减工程内容或改变原来修建方案的有三项，节省了二百二十七亿元。延缓主要设备的安装及削减不必要的设备，节省了九十亿元。这样就保证了把基本建设投资集中使用到修建主要工程方面。
