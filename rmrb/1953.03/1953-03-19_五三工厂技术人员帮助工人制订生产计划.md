Xinhua News Agency:

    In the discussion of the national plan, all the technicians of the Fifth Three Factory in the Northeast were divided into nineteen professional groups and went deep into the workshops to help the workers find tricks and tap potential. From mid-January to now, with the help of technicians, the workers of the factory have put forward 225 rationalization proposals, and 206 of them have been approved and adopted. Only technician Wang Guiyi's help to workers Zhang Mingpu and others to change the single-eye machine into a double-eye machine has increased the output by 85%. At the same time as the technicians went deep into the workshop, some of the more capable staff also went deep into the workshop to help the workers formulate production plans. They taught the workers economic knowledge and helped them calculate carefully, so that the plans could be made more accurately.

    五三工厂技术人员帮助工人制订生产计划
    东北五三工厂在讨论国家计划中，全部技术人员分成十九个专业小组深入车间，帮助工人找窍门、挖潜力。从一月中旬开始到现在，全厂工人在技术人员帮助下，提出合理化建议二百二十五件，经批准采纳的已有二百零六件。仅技术人员汪贵一帮助工人张明普等，把单眼机器改成双眼机器，就使产量提高百分之八十五。和技术人员深入车间同时，一部分能力较强的职员，也深入车间帮助工人订生产计划。他们教给工人以经济知识，并帮助工人算细账，使计划订得更确切。（新华社）
