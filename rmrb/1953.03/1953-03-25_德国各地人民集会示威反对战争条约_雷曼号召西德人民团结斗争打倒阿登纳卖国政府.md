Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 24th: Mass demonstrations protesting the West German Federal Parliament's ratification of the Bonn-Paris war treaty have been held in all cities of the German Democratic Republic. A rally of 50,000 people was held in Erfurt, a rally of 10,000 people was held in Mühlhausen, and tens of thousands of people participated in a protest rally in Leipzig. The working people at the meetings pledged to strengthen the struggle for the unification of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty, and they also pledged to better complete the national economic plan to strengthen the base of the German people's struggle for unification - the German Democratic Republic.

The working people of various enterprises in the democratic districts of Berlin have sent countless letters and resolutions protesting the ratification of the war treaty.

In the cities and factories of the Ruhr region of West Germany, workers distributed countless leaflets calling on the people of West Germany to prevent the implementation of the war treaty. On the morning of March 21st, slogans calling on the people of West Germany to rise up and overthrow the Adenauer government and oppose the Bonn-Paris Treaty appeared everywhere on walls and buildings.

The working people of Lübeck held a torchlight parade against the implementation of the Bonn-Paris Treaty. Young people participating in the parade shouted: "Adenauer, Lehr, Blank, West German youth don't want tanks!"

The West German Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany called on all workers, peasants and intellectuals in West Germany to unite and fight against the war treaty and to save the unification of Germany.

Three thousand residents of West Berlin held a rally in the Friedrichshain district of democratic Berlin on March 21st, passing a resolution protesting Adenauer's anti-people policies and opposing the war treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to a TASS report from Berlin on March 23rd citing the German News Agency in Düsseldorf: The chairman of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, received a reporter from "Freies Volk" and answered some questions raised by the reporter regarding the Federal Parliament's ratification of the Bonn and Paris war treaties.

Reimann said that Adenauer and his government's coalition parties passed the Bonn and Paris war treaties by a majority vote. At that time, the parliament building was surrounded by thousands of armed police and troops, and barbed wire was erected around it. Squads of police were stationed inside the Federal Parliament and maintained contact with the occupying forces by radio. The German people were blocked by these police measures from seeing the members of parliament.

The majority of members of parliament agreed to pass these treaties, which is a direct violation of the unanimously expressed will of the German people. The German people have resolutely rejected these treaties and are increasingly loudly demanding the convening of a Four-Power Conference to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, restore German unity and withdraw the occupying forces.

Decisions passed under fascist police terror, in violation of the unanimous will of the people, cannot and will never be binding on Germany. As far as the German people are concerned, the Bonn and Paris Treaties are invalid and have no moral, political or legal force.

In answering the question of how the German people should prevent the implementation of these war treaties and strive for peace in Germany and Europe, Reimann pointed out that he had put forward the five demands of the German people in his speech in the Federal Parliament. These five demands are: convening a Four-Power Conference, concluding a peace treaty, withdrawing the occupying forces, restoring German unity, and holding free all-German elections to elect members of the National Assembly. Reimann said: The German people must concentrate all their efforts to realize these demands that conform to the highest interests of the German nation. We must overthrow the Adenauer government. The people must crush Adenauer's policy of establishing a military and fascist dictatorship. The German people have the power to do this. The working class must immediately achieve unified action in enterprises and trade unions. An alliance between the working class and the peasantry must be established. It is also necessary to intensify the unity of all patriotic forces of the German people in order to actively resist this war policy and fight for peace, unity and independence.

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to the German News Agency in Düsseldorf on March 21st: A few hours after the West German Federal Parliament passed the Bonn and Paris war treaties, which betray national interests and humiliate the country, the youth of Frankfurt am Main in West Germany, including members of the Social Democratic youth organization "Young Falcons" and "Friends of Nature", immediately issued a statement saying: "We do not recognize these treaties as valid because we believe that, according to the current composition of the Federal Parliament, it has no power to ratify these treaties." The youth also announced that they would oppose the decision on the conscription system.

On March 19th, at a rally in Frankfurt am Main protesting the ratification of the Bonn and Paris war treaties, Johannes Ude, a famous professor of economics at the University of Graz, also gave a speech against the two treaties.

On the same day, in Fürth, six hundred residents of Nuremberg and Fürth held a rally with French youth resistance fighters protesting the ratification of the Bonn and Paris death treaties, becoming a joint demonstration of the German and French people against the war treaty.

On the evening of March 19th, protest marches against the ratification of the war treaty were held in Bonn, Karlsruhe, Darmstadt, Stuttgart and many other cities in West Germany.

    德国各地人民集会示威反对战争条约
    雷曼号召西德人民团结斗争打倒阿登纳卖国政府
    【新华社二十四日讯】柏林消息：在德意志民主共和国，所有的城市中都举行了抗议西德联邦议院批准波恩与巴黎战争条约的群众性示威。在欧法特举行了五万人的抗议大会，在慕尔豪森举行了一万人的抗议大会，在来比锡有几万人参加了抗议集会。劳动人民在会上保证加强斗争，争取统一德国和缔结和约，他们还保证将更好地完成国民经济计划以加强德国人民争取统一斗争的基地——德意志民主共和国。
    柏林民主区各企业的劳动人民发出了无数抗议批准战争条约的信件与决议。
    在西德鲁尔地区各城市和工厂中，工人们散发了无数传单，号召西德人民阻止实现战争条约。三月二十一日早上，到处的墙壁上、建筑物上出现了号召西德人民起来推翻阿登纳政府、反对波恩与巴黎条约的标语。
    卢卑克的劳动人民举行了反对实现波恩与巴黎条约的火炬游行。参加游行的青年高呼：“阿登纳、勒尔、布兰克，西德青年不要坦克！”
    民主德国全国阵线西德委员会号召西德全体工人、农民和知识分子团结起来，为反对战争条约、拯救德国的统一而斗争。
    西柏林的三千居民三月二十一日在柏林民主区的腓特烈区举行集会，通过了抗议阿登纳反人民的政策和反对战争条约的决议。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十三日讯引德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫消息：德国共产党主席马克斯·雷曼接见“自由人民”报记者，就联邦议院批准波恩及巴黎战争条约事回答了记者提出的一些问题。
    雷曼说，阿登纳及其政府联合党派以多数票通过了波恩及巴黎战争条约。当时，议院大楼周围密布着好几千武装警察及军队，并在周围架设了铁丝网。一队队的警察在联邦议院内站岗并用无线电与占领军保持着联系。德国人民被这些警察措施阻挡住不能去见议员们。
    多数议员同意通过这些条约，是直接地违背了德国人民所一致表示的意志的。德国人民已经坚决不移地拒绝了这些条约并且愈来愈响亮地要求召开四国会议以缔结对德和约，恢复德国统一及撤退占领军。
    在法西斯警察恐怖下，违反人民一致的意志所通过的决定，不可能、也永远不会对德国有约束力。就德国人民来说，波恩及巴黎条约是无效的，也没有任何道德、政治或法律的力量。
    在回答德国人民应怎样来制止这些战争条约的执行和争取得到德国及欧洲和平的问题时，雷曼指出，他在联邦议院发言时曾提出了德国人民的五项要求。这五项要求是：召开四国会议，缔结和约，撤退占领军，恢复德国的统一及为选出国民议会议员而举行全德自由选举。雷曼说：德国人民必须集中一切力量使这些符合德国民族最高利益的要求得以实现。我们必须打倒阿登纳政府。人民必须粉碎阿登纳打算建立军事及法西斯独裁的政策。德国人民有力量这样做。工人阶级必须立刻在企业及工会中取得一致行动。必须建立工人阶级和农民之间的联盟。还必须加紧团结德国人民的一切爱国力量，以便积极抵抗这种战争政策，并为争取和平、统一与独立而斗争。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫二十一日讯：西德联邦议院通过丧权辱国的波恩与巴黎战争条约之后几小时，西德美因河畔法兰克福城的青年，包括社会民主党青年组织“鹰团”与“自然之友”的团员在内，立即发表了一项声明说：“我们不承认这些条约是有效的，因为我们认为，按照联邦议院目前的组成，它没有权力批准这些条约。”青年们同时宣布他们将反对兵役制度的决定。
        三月十九日，在美因河畔法兰克福举行的一个抗议批准波恩与巴黎战争条约的大会上，格拉茨大学的著名经济学教授约翰尼斯·乌德也发表演说反对这两个条约。
    同日，在佛尔特地方，纽伦堡和佛尔特的六百个居民与法国青年抵抗运动战士在一起举行了抗议批准波恩与巴黎死亡条约的集会，成为德法人民共同反对战争条约的联合示威。
    三月十九日晚间，在波恩、加尔斯卢合、达姆斯塔德、斯图加特以及西德其他许多城市中都举行了抗议批准战争条约的示威游行。
