Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 7th (TASS): The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions issued the following notice: Dear Comrades!

	With extreme grief, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions notifies all trade union members and all workers that the Soviet people have suffered a great misfortune: our great leader, teacher, father, and friend, our beloved Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, has passed away. Comrade Stalin dedicated his entire glorious and heroic life to a noble purpose: the liberation of the workers and the struggle for the victory of communism. Comrade Stalin, together with Lenin, founded and nurtured the powerful Communist Party, which led the working class and the laboring peasants to the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution of historical significance. In the years of the civil war and foreign intervention, our people, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, defeated the enemy and defended the achievements of the October Revolution. Comrade Stalin, together with Lenin, established the multinational socialist state - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Comrade Stalin inherited Lenin's immortal cause, held high Lenin's banner, and guided our party and all the Soviet people forward along the path indicated by Lenin. Under the brilliant leadership of Comrade Stalin, our motherland has transformed into a powerful socialist country in a short historical period. During the Great Patriotic War, the great genius of Comrade Stalin led the Soviet people to achieve the victory of world-historical significance over the German fascist aggressors. For more than thirty years, Comrade Stalin led our country forward along the road of building communism. Comrade Stalin armed the party and all the people with a great and clear program for building communism in the Soviet Union. Comrade Stalin's immortal cause and great ideas will forever live in our hearts, illuminating our path to victory. Comrade Stalin led and inspired the just struggle of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp against war and for peace and human happiness. The working people of all countries and the working people of the Soviet Union share the pain and sorrow for this irreparable loss. The Soviet people fully realize that now that Comrade Stalin has left us, the responsibility of each of us for the victory of the great cause of communist construction is incomparably increased. All the working people of our country are infinitely loyal to their beloved Communist Party. They firmly believe that the great Lenin-Stalin Party will lead the Soviet people forward along the path indicated by Comrade Stalin. The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions calls on all members and all workers to unite more closely around the Communist Party, the Central Committee, and the Soviet government, and to redouble their efforts to fight for the construction of communism and the strengthening of the power of our socialist country. Our beloved leader and teacher, we solemnly swear to you: The Soviet trade unions will, under the leadership of the Communist Party, tirelessly fight to accomplish the cause to which you contributed all your strength and life.
	Long live our great Soviet people!
	Long live the heroic Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Lenin-Stalin Party!
	All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions
