    Xi'an
    [Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of March 6th, just as the people of all ethnic groups in Xi'an were waiting with great concern for news of Chairman Stalin's recovery, the news of Stalin's death suddenly arrived, and a sorrowful atmosphere quickly enveloped the entire city. Ma Mingfang, Third Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Ma Wenrui, Deputy Secretary, Pan Zili, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, and Zhao Boping, Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the CPC, immediately went to the residences of Soviet friends in Xi'an to express their deep condolences.
    Upon hearing this unfortunate news, the workers in the turbine room of the Xi'an Power Plant immediately stopped working and observed a moment of silence. Many workers lowered their heads and kept wiping away tears, unable to speak for a long time. Wei Huaisan, a veteran worker of more than 20 years, could only utter the words "Stalin" before becoming too overwhelmed with grief to continue. The entire staff of the Xi'an Railway Transportation Company held an emergency meeting to express their deepest condolences. Zhao Zhankui, a special-class labor hero and Director of the Northwest Labor Bureau, also immediately convened a general meeting of Party members and Youth League members in the bureau to express condolences. Upon hearing the unfortunate news, teachers and students of all ethnic groups at the Northwest Art Institute immediately set up a mourning hall, wore black纱, took turns guarding the spirit, and sang "Dirges." When the sad news reached the suburbs of Xi'an, rural Party and Youth League branches in the suburbs also held meetings to express condolences and quickly spread the news to the masses. Zhang Shouxin, a farmer in Renjiakou Village, recalling the wise and decisive demeanor of Stalin he saw in the films "The Unforgettable Year 1919" and "The Fall of Berlin," and thinking of his selfless assistance to the Chinese people, said: "Comrade Stalin, you have devoted your heart to the people of the world. Just as we are moving towards a better life day by day, you have left us. How can we not feel sad? In the future, we must strengthen our unity with our Soviet brothers under the leadership of Chairman Mao to commemorate you forever."
    Students from various schools in Xi'an organized forums and memorial services. At the forums in various classes of the Shaanxi Provincial Women's Middle School, the students unanimously swore to strengthen unity, study hard, and be good students of Stalin and Chairman Mao. They all called this meeting "an unforgettable class meeting."

After hearing this unfortunate news, tears streamed down her face, and she couldn't eat her meal.
    The soldiers of the local garrison unanimously expressed their determination to strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, learn military technology well, master the weapons in their hands, and resolutely defend the motherland's coastal defense.

Many workers proposed to strive to become glorious Communist Party members. Worker Liu Cunxiu said: "Whenever I mention Stalin's name, I remember the Soviet experts sent by Comrade Stalin to help us build the Tianlan Road. They helped us build as if they were working for themselves. We will never forget this spirit of internationalism."

    Heilongjiang Province
    [Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of March 6th, the people of Qiqihar City heard the sad news of the death of our most beloved friend and mentor, Comrade Stalin, amidst raging winds and snow. Many people from all walks of life in Qiqihar City stood silently in front of the radio wiping away tears. Some typesetting workers stood in silence beside the type case as soon as they received the draft. Steelmaker Gao Shanpu said that in order to mourn Comrade Stalin, we must study the Soviet rapid steelmaking method well and strive to refine five furnaces a day on the basis of refining three furnaces a day.
    In Aihui County, which is separated from the Soviet Union by only a river, many people, upon hearing the news, immediately gathered together in knee-deep snow to listen to the radio and hold forums. They all said that in 1945, when we were still under the brutal rule of the Japanese invaders, the Soviet Red Army sent by Comrade Stalin first liberated us, and then liberated all the people of Northeast China. Upon hearing the news of Comrade Stalin's death, Orunchun ethnic minority cadre Mode Sheng went everywhere to publicize to the people of the ethnic group, recalling Comrade Stalin's deep friendship with the Chinese people. Now, people from all walks of life in Aihui are clearing a large amount of snow in the square and on the streets, preparing to hold a memorial service on the 9th.
    Ge Zhencai, a farmer in Huma Town, which is closely adjacent to the Soviet Union, had personally witnessed his father and brother being killed by the Japanese invaders, and also personally witnessed the Red Army sent by Comrade Stalin defeating the Japanese invaders and liberating the Northeast. Therefore, she said that tens of millions of people in the Northeast compared Stalin to their parents, actually even closer than their parents. She expressed that she would better unite with the Soviet people, strive for national construction, and defend world peace.
