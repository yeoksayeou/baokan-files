Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: American news agencies admit that in the battle for "Old Baldy," a mountain northwest of Yeoncheon on the Korean front, the US invading forces were once again beaten bloody by the heroic Korean and Chinese People's armies and driven off the mountain.

According to the United Press, "Old Baldy" was considered by the US invading forces as an "important position" "shielding the key route from Cheorwon to Yeoncheon in the western sector of the central front." The US military authorities dispatched what they considered to be the "elite" 7th Division - the so-called "most experienced unit in the Korean War" - to defend it. The commander of the US 7th Division, Trudeau, boasted:

"Old Baldy" is "the most fortified position."

However, even the American news agencies admitted that this so-called "most fortified position" of the US invading forces was occupied shortly after the Korean and Chinese People's armies launched an attack on the 23rd. The puppet armies, which have always been placed at the front by the US military – this time it was the Colombian army,

“Suffered a crushing defeat.” They were either killed or wounded, and even the commander of the Colombian battalion, Luis, and the spokesman for the US Eighth Army had to admit that the Colombian army "suffered heavy losses."

The American troops in the US 7th Division then launched a frantic counterattack. The US counterattacks on the 24th all failed. The commander of the US Eighth Army, Taylor, hurriedly rushed to the front to supervise the battle and sent reserve troops to reinforce the front lines. However, the result of the US counterattack on the 25th was still just as tragic. A UPI reporter wrote: "American troops, covered in mud from the all-night rain, slowly climbed the steep hillside, only to encounter intense mortar and artillery fire from behind the Communist lines." "They ran into an iron wall." In this situation, Taylor "seemed uneasy about the progress of the battle." The UPI reporter also said: "The US troops attacked for ten hours, trying to drive the Communists off Old Baldy, but were repulsed by mortar, rifle, and artillery fire, as well as a rain of grenades." In the battle to smash the American invading forces' counterattack, the powerful artillery fire of the Korean and Chinese People's armies, in coordination with the infantry, inflicted heavy blows on the enemy. American reporters exclaimed that the artillery fire launched by the Korean and Chinese People's armies "was the most intense artillery fire launched by the Communists since the Battle of Triangle Hill." A US officer described the intensity and accuracy of our army's artillery fire, saying: "As soon as someone sticks his head out, our trench network attracts enemy fire." After the American invading forces' counterattacks repeatedly suffered disastrous defeats, the spokesman for the US Eighth Army announced helplessly on the 26th that the US troops had withdrawn from "Old Baldy." But in order to cover up the disastrous defeat of the US military, he clumsily said that the retreat was for "strategic reasons."

In the fierce battle for "Old Baldy," the Associated Press admitted that the US military "suffered heavy losses." UPI said: "Although the number of American casualties cannot be disclosed, it is very large. Helicopters are constantly flying back and forth in the air, transporting the wounded from the 7th Division's first aid station to the rear hospitals." The American army "has been weakened by heavy casualties." However, American generals, who serve the interests of Wall Street, are completely indifferent to the heavy casualties of American soldiers. A report by United Press International reporter, Ellegant, on the 25th, revealed Taylor's "cold-blooded" inspection of the wounded soldiers in the hospital. The reporter wrote: "Lieutenant General Taylor, commander of the Eighth Army, sent soldiers from the 32nd Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division to attack the enemy forces entrenched on the summit of Old Baldy last night. Today, in the 43rd Surgical Hospital, 12 miles from the front lines, this cold-blooded general came to calculate the bloody cost of this battle. He slowly walked past rows of canvas beds, on which lay bodies broken by the war—bleeding Americans, Koreans, and Colombians. Outside the long rows of white tents of the hospital, rows of broken-winged helicopters, like ugly storks with bent backs, waited to load more wounded soldiers. The distant sound of artillery mocked the forced smiles of the gray-haired head nurse.

Taylor is clearly unmoved by the consequences of the orders he must issue. Two officers were discussing their points for rotation home, and Taylor said: Don't worry about the points. You will stay here and help me fight in this war.

The straight-shouldered general strode out of the tent and headed for his jeep. He will take the jeep to an airport to fly to Eighth Army headquarters in Seoul, where he may have to issue another order, sending fresh troops to their deaths or crippling them. At this time, to the northwest, artillery was booming, and American soldiers were dying on Old Baldy."

### 美国通讯社承认美军一再遭受惨败

    美国通讯社承认美军一再遭受惨败
    【新华社二十八日讯】　美国通讯社承认，在朝鲜前线涟川西北被美方称为“老秃山”的山岭争夺战中，美国侵略军再一次被英勇的朝中人民军队打得头破血流，并被逐出了山头。
    据合众社透露：“老秃山”被美国侵略军认为是“屏障着中线西部铁原到涟川的要道”的一个“重要阵地”。美军当局派遣了他们认为“精锐”的第七师——所谓“朝鲜战争中最有经验的一支部队”据守在这里。美军第七师师长特鲁多曾吹嘘说：
    “老秃山”是“最坚固的阵地”。
    但是，连美国通讯社也承认：美国侵略军的这个所谓“最坚固的阵地”，在朝中人民军队在二十三日发起攻击后不久就被占领了。一向被美军放在前沿挡头阵的仆从国军队——这次是哥伦比亚军队，
    “被打得一败涂地”。他们死的死，伤的伤，甚至哥伦比亚营营长路易斯和美国第八军发言人都不得不承认：哥伦比亚军“遭受了惨重的损失”。
    美军第七师中的美国部队接着进行了疯狂的反扑。美军二十四日的几次反扑一一遭到失败。美国第八军军长泰勒急忙亲自赶到前线督战，并派后备部队前去增援前线，可是，美军在二十五日的反扑的结果仍旧同样悲惨。合众社记者写道：“美国军队为通宵大雨弄得泥泞满身，慢慢地攻上陡峭的山坡，就遇到共军阵线后面的火力阵地所发射出来的密集的迫击炮和大炮炮火。”“他们碰到了一道铜墙铁壁。”在这种情况下，泰勒也“似乎对战斗进行的情况表示不安”。合众社记者又说：“美军进攻了十小时，要想把共军赶出老秃山，但是被迫击炮、步枪和大炮炮火以及一阵如雨般的手榴弹打退了。”在粉碎美国侵略军反扑的战斗中，朝中人民军队的强大炮火配合步兵给了敌军以沉重的打击。美国记者惊呼，朝中人民军队发射的炮火，“是自从三角山战斗开始以来共军发射的最猛烈的炮火。”一个美国军官形容我军炮火的猛烈和准确的情形说：“只要有一个人把脑袋伸出去，我们的壕沟网就招来了敌人的火力。”美国侵略军的反扑一再遭到惨败后，美国第八军发言人于二十六日无可奈何地宣布：美军撤出“老秃山”。但是为了掩盖美军的惨败，他笨拙地说，撤退是因为“战略原因”。
    美国侵略军在“老秃山”的激烈争夺战中，美联社承认“遭到了惨重的损失”。合众社说：“美军的伤亡数字虽然不能透露，却是很大的。直升飞机不断地在空中来回，把伤员由第七师的急救站运到后方医院去。”美国军队“由于受到重大伤亡而削弱了”。可是，为华尔街利益服务的美国将军对于美国士兵的惨重伤亡完全无动于中。美国国际新闻社记者埃勒根特二十五日电透露的泰勒“冷酷地”巡视伤兵医院的情形说明了这一点。记者写道：“第八军军长泰勒中将昨晚派出第七步兵师第三十二团的士兵去攻打在老秃山山顶筑壕据守的敌军。今天，在距战线十二哩的第四十三外科医院中，这位冷若冰霜的将军来计算这次战斗的血肉横飞的代价。他慢慢地走过一排排帆布床，上面放着为战争所破坏的人体——流血的美国人、朝鲜人和哥伦比亚人。在医院的长排的白色帐篷外边，几排折翼的直升飞机，像丑陋的鹳鸟弯着背停在那里，等待着装载更多的伤兵来。辽远的炮声嘲弄着白发苍苍的护士长的强颜欢笑。
    泰勒对于他所必须发布的命令所造成的后果，他显然是丝毫无动于中的。两个军官在谈论着轮换回家的点数，泰勒说：不要担忧点数。你们要留在这里，在这次战争中帮我打仗。
    肩膀挺直的将军阔步走出帐篷，走向他的吉普车。他将坐吉普车到一个飞机场去搭飞机到汉城的第八军总部去，在那里，他可能又得发出命令，派出生力军去送死或把他们变成残废。这时，在西北面，大炮在轰击，美国兵在老秃山上死亡。”
