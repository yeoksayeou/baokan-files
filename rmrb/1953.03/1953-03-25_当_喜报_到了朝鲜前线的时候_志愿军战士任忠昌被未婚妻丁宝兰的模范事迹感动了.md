When the Volunteer Army was joyously celebrating their third Spring Festival in Korea, the house where Deputy Squad Leader Ren Zhongchang and his comrades lived was packed with people. Some were playing cards, some were playing Chinese chess or war chess; others were practicing for the evening's performance, preparing for a joint military-civilian celebration. At that moment, the cultural instructor strode across the threshold and said with a smile, "Comrades, Happy Spring Festival!" Everyone replied in unison, "We're fine. Happy Spring Festival to you, Instructor!"

Before the instructor could speak, Little Zhang spotted the newspaper in his hand.

"Are you reading us the newspaper even during the New Year?"

"Of course. Today's paper is different from usual, it's actually good news!"

The room immediately fell silent, and everyone surrounded the cultural instructor.

"Have we won another battle?" Someone put down their cards and bounced up from the kang like a rubber ball.

"That's just a regular occurrence," the instructor said, waving the newspaper in his hand. "This good news comes from afar!" Everyone stared blankly at the cultural instructor, urging him to quickly reveal the "good news." The impetuous Little Zhang reached out to snatch the newspaper from the cultural instructor's hand.

"Wait, let the instructor read it to us!" Deputy Squad Leader Ren Zhongchang pulled Little Zhang back.

A burst of anti-aircraft fire sounded in the distance, rattling the window paper. The cultural instructor sat down beside Little Zhang. Looking at the "Resist America, Aid Korea" medal on Deputy Squad Leader Ren Zhongchang's chest, he smiled and said, "A good woman matches a good man, a hero matches a model." The instructor deliberately raised his voice, reading like a small loudspeaker, "Baolan has come to the Old Ren's house!"

Upon hearing the name "Baolan," Ren Zhongchang's face immediately turned red, and he said embarrassedly, "Instructor, why are you making fun of me!"

Little Zhang snatched the newspaper and bounced it in front of the deputy squad leader: "Deputy Squad Leader, look, look." Then he read the title on the newspaper: "Baolan Has Come to the Old Ren's House – A Record of Ding Baolan, Fiancée of Volunteer Soldier Ren Zhongchang." Playful Little Zhang pronounced the words "Baolan" particularly loudly, and Deputy Squad Leader Ren Zhongchang lowered his head, blushing and silent. At this point, everyone erupted in laughter. "The Deputy Squad Leader's fiancée is in the newspaper, that's really something." "Women in the new society have truly broken through feudalism." ... No one bothered to read the newspaper. Hu Junbo suddenly jumped up and said, "Let the instructor read it to us, everyone listen carefully!"

"This is the February 4th People's Daily 'Resist America, Aid Korea' special edition. The title is..." the instructor introduced, and then read it word by word.

When he read, "I also attended the county's labor model conference... This year is a bumper year, averaging seven *shi* of grain per *qing* of land, and the entire team has completed the production plan. Our family not only paid off the old debts, but also bought more than fifty *chi* of cloth and more than ten *jin* of cotton, and we all wear new cotton clothes. We plan to sell the remaining grain next year to buy a horse and repair the house," Ren Zhongchang couldn't help but say, "She's really capable, as good as a man. Even if I were at home, I wouldn't necessarily do as well."

That night, the snow fell heavily, and the wind howled. The clock had already struck twelve, but Deputy Squad Leader Ren Zhongchang was still tossing and turning, unable to sleep. He kept thinking, "How can I thank her?" Finally, he realized: I am one of the most beloved people of the motherland, a defender of peace. I can only kill more American devils on the front lines and strive to earn merit in Korea, sending the good news home to thank her.

The next morning, Deputy Squad Leader Ren Zhongchang, without even washing his face or brushing his teeth, wrote a reply: "You truly deserve to be called a woman of the new society. Since you came to my house, you have managed our family's life so well. This not only encourages my determination to kill the enemy at the front, but also encourages thousands upon thousands of our Volunteer Army comrades. I don't worry about anything at home. I assure you: I will learn from your spirit of production to kill the enemy, and work and study even harder. I hope that you will work even harder in production at home, and provide more support to the front lines. Let us work together to defeat the American imperialist aggressors as soon as possible."

    当“喜报”到了朝鲜前线的时候
    ——志愿军战士任忠昌被未婚妻丁宝兰的模范事迹感动了
    刘戬东
    正是志愿军在朝鲜欢度第三个春节的时候，副班长任忠昌他们住的房子里挤满了人。有的在打扑克，有的在下象棋，下军棋；还有人正在练习演出的节目，准备在晚间开军民联欢会。这时文化教员一步跨进了门坎，笑着说：“同志们，春节你们好啊！”大家异口同声地说：“我们好。教员你好啊！”
    还没等教员出声，小张一眼就看见了教员手里还拿着报纸。
    “过年还来给我们读报纸啦？”
    “当然。今天的报不同往常，还是个喜报哪！”
    屋里立刻变得鸦雀无声，大家围住了文化教员。
    “咱们又打胜仗了吧？”有人放下扑克从炕头上像皮球似地蹦起来问。
    “那还不是平常事，”教员说，他摇动手里的报纸，“这喜报来的远呢！”大家直愣愣地望着文化教员，催促他把“喜报”赶快说出来。孩子气的小张伸手就夺文化教员手里的报纸。
    “慢着，还是让教员给咱们读吧！”副班长任忠昌拉小张一下说。
    远处传来一阵高射炮声，震得窗户纸沙沙地响。文化教员在小张的身旁坐下。看了看副班长任忠昌胸前的抗美援朝纪念章笑道：“好女配好男，英雄配模范。”教员特意把声音放大些，像小喇叭似地念道：“宝兰上老任家来了！”
    听到“宝兰”两个字，任忠昌的脸马上红了，不好意思地说：“教员你怎么和我开玩笑呢！”
    小张一把把报纸夺过去，蹦哒蹦哒地送到副班长眼前：“班副，你看，你看。”接着他念着报上的标题：“宝兰上老任家来了记志愿军战士任忠昌的未婚妻丁宝兰”。玩皮的小张把“宝兰”两字念得声音特别高，副班长任忠昌低下头红着脸不作声。这时大家哄成一团。“班副的未婚妻上报纸了，真不简单。”“新社会的妇女真打破了封建了。”……谁也没有顾得读报纸。胡俊伯忽然蹦起身来说：“还是让教员给咱们读一下，大家仔细听听吧！”
    “这是二月四号人民日报抗美援朝专刊。标题是……。”教员介绍着，又一字一字地读下去。
    当他读到“我还参加了县的劳动模范会……。今年是丰收年，平均一垧地打七石粮呢，全组完成生产计划啦。咱家不仅把过去的欠账还了，还买了五十多尺布，十多斤棉花，我们都穿上新棉衣啦。剩下的粮食准备明年卖了买个马，再把房子修理修理。”的时候，任忠昌情不自禁地说：“的确真能干，赶上男子了。就是我在家，也不一定干得这样好。”
    当天晚上，大雪在纷纷地下，大风在呼呼地刮，时钟已经敲过了十二点了，副班长任忠昌还是翻来覆去睡不着。总是在想：“我如何来感谢她呢？”最后，他想到：我是祖国的一个最可爱的人，是和平的捍卫者，我只有在火线上多多杀美国鬼子，争取在朝鲜立功，把喜报寄到家中来感谢她。
    第二天清晨，副班长任忠昌脸没顾得洗，牙也没顾得刷，就写了封回信：“你真不愧是一个新社会的妇女。自你到我家来，把我家的生活搞的那样好。这不仅鼓舞了我在前方杀敌的决心，也鼓舞了我们志愿军的千千万万同志们。我不惦念家中的一切，我向你保证：我一定要学习你的生产精神去杀敌，更进一步地努力工作，努力学习。我希望你在家中更加努力生产，多多支援前线，我们一齐努力，早日打垮美帝国主义侵略军。”
