    Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region Warm Areas
    Begin Spring Plowing Production
    The Kangzang Plateau has begun to thaw, and spring plowing production has begun in the warmer areas of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, such as Batang, Derong, Xiangcheng, and the valley areas along the Yalong River and Dadu River. Farmers of all ethnic groups in other regions are constantly transporting fertilizer to the fields. Atai Township in the Muya District of Kangding has already transported more than seven million catties of base fertilizer; some areas are repairing canals; and hundreds of thousands of cattle grazing on the grasslands are also being driven back to the villages for use in spring plowing production.
    The People's Government of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region is actively leading production work. In mid-February to early March, the People's Governments of various counties concentrated all cadres to study production policies and production knowledge, and organized production work teams to go to the countryside to specifically guide farmers in production. The Kangding Local Committee of the Communist Party of China also organized a work team of more than 50 people to go to various districts to inspect production work. Since last winter, the Autonomous Region People's Government has been actively transporting and distributing agricultural tools to various places. So far, more than 47,000 pieces of agricultural tools have been transported to various counties; at the same time, more than 230 new-style agricultural tools such as walking plows, seeders, and disc harrows have been loaned out, ready for demonstration and promotion in various counties. The Muya District People's Government of Kangding County held an agricultural technology training class for more than 130 people. In addition, the People's Banks of various counties have sent many cadres or mobile loan teams to the countryside to carry out agricultural loan work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西康藏族自治区温暖地区
    开始春耕生产
    康藏高原已开始解冻，西康省藏族自治区气候较温暖的巴塘、得荣、乡城和沿雅砻江大渡河两岸的河谷地带，开始春耕生产。其他地区的各族农民们，正在不停地向地里运送肥料，康定木雅区阿太乡即已运送了七百多万斤基肥；有的地区正在整修水渠；放牧在草原上的成千上万的耕牛，也正被赶回村庄，以便在春耕生产中使用它们。
    西康省藏族自治区人民政府正积极领导生产工作，各县人民政府在二月中旬到三月上旬，集中了全体干部学习生产政策和生产知识，并组织生产工作队下乡具体领导农民生产。中共康定地方委员会还组织了五十多人的工作队，分别到各区检查生产工作。自治区人民政府在去年冬季开始向各地运发农具，到目前为止，运往各县的农具已达四万七千多件；同时还贷放了步犁、播种机、圆盘耙等二百三十多部新式农具，准备在各县示范推广。康定县木雅区人民政府举办了一百三十多人的农业技术训练班。此外，各县人民银行已派出了很多干部或流动贷款小组，下乡进行农贷工作。（新华社）
