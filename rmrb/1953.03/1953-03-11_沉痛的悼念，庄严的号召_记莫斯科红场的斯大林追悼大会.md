    Deep Mourning, Solemn Call
    ——Remembering the Stalin Memorial Service on Red Square
    On the morning of the 9th, the sky over Moscow shared in the people's grief. Red Square was solemn and silent, with snowflakes fluttering in the sky.
    Moscow awoke early in sorrow. From early morning, people gathered in Red Square from all directions. By about 9:30, the grandstand in Red Square was filled with the entire delegation of the People's Republic of China, representatives from Asian countries such as Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam, representatives from the Eastern European People's Democracies, representatives of the working people and governments of capitalist countries and colonies, as well as heroes and model figures from the Soviet armed forces, workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals. Opposite the Red Square Mausoleum, the ranks of students from Soviet military academies and various military schools of the Soviet Army, Navy, and Air Force were arranged neatly and impressively, bearing the glorious, victorious Soviet military flags to pay their final respects to the great Stalin, who led them from victory to victory. Behind them were representatives of the working people from various districts of Moscow, holding aloft huge portraits of Stalin bordered with black and red brocade.
    At 10:35, a mournful melody, both rising and falling, echoed over Red Square. The venue fell silent. People stood up solemnly, watching the funeral procession slowly enter Red Square from Okhotny Ryad-Manezhnaya Square. At the head of the procession was a long line carrying wreaths. Senior Soviet military commanders, led by Marshal Budyonny, held red velvet cushions in their hands, upon which lay the dazzling orders and medals awarded to the great Stalin by the Soviet government in recognition of his great achievements.
    Behind them, a gun carriage drawn by six black horses carried the remains of the giant of human history – Comrade Stalin. His remains lay peacefully in a crystal coffin adorned with red satin. On the coffin lay the military cap of the Soviet Marshal. Following closely behind the remains was a long funeral procession, led by G.M. Malenkov, K.E. Voroshilov, Zhou Enlai, L.P. Beria, L.M. Kaganovich, V.M. Molotov, N.A. Bulganin, and N.S. Khrushchev. Following them were the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, the leading comrades of communist and workers' parties from various countries, as well as outstanding representatives of the Soviet people and representatives of many national governments.
    After ten minutes, the mourners stopped in front of the Mausoleum. The glorious Soviet military flags, which had won immortal victories under the leadership of the greatest commander, Comrade Stalin, in the Great Patriotic War, were lowered in salute. The coffin was moved from the gun carriage to a high platform covered with red and black flags.
    Malenkov, Beria, Molotov, and other leaders of the Soviet Party and government, as well as the leading comrades of fraternal parties from various countries, then ascended the tomb platform.
    At 10:52, Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Stalin Funeral Committee, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Council of Ministers, announced the commencement of the memorial service.
    Comrades Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov successively delivered speeches. In somber and firm tones, they recounted the immortal contributions of the great Stalin in creating the strong Soviet state, in developing the Marxist-Leninist theories on national issues, socialist economic issues, and other important matters. They solemnly called on all the Soviet people to jointly ensure the further prosperity of the socialist motherland, to continue to strengthen the great Communist Party, and to safeguard and consolidate the greatest achievement of the people of all countries—the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and to strengthen the friendship and unity of the people of all countries in the democratic camp.
    At 11:54, the memorial service concluded, and the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, and the leaders of fraternal parties and governments from various countries, descended from the tomb platform. Malenkov, Beria, Molotov, Voroshilov, Khrushchev, Bulganin, Kaganovich, and Mikoyan lifted the coffin and slowly walked into the Mausoleum. At the entrance of the Mausoleum were inscribed two infinitely dear and eternally immortal names: Lenin Stalin.
    A thirty-gun salute resounded over Red Square, and the clock on the Spassky Tower of the Kremlin struck twelve. The sirens of all factories, locomotives, and ships in Moscow and throughout the Soviet Union sounded continuously for three minutes. At this moment, the entire Soviet Union was observing a moment of silence for the great father and teacher of the people. Everywhere, from the Baltic coast to the Kuril Islands, all industrial enterprises stopped work for five minutes, and trains, cars, and ships sailing at sea also stopped... The whole country deeply mourned this tremendous loss.
    The silent people attending the funeral recalled the great achievements of the great Stalin for all mankind, and silently repeated the calls of Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov. Soon, the mournful music on Red Square ceased, and the band played the majestic Soviet national anthem.
    Then, the leaders of the Soviet Party and government, and the leading comrades of the parties and governments of fraternal countries, once again ascended the Mausoleum. The solemn military parade began. This victorious army, nurtured by Stalin, marched past the Mausoleum in orderly steps, and planes flew in neat formations high in the sky, paying tribute to the great leader and commander, J.V. Stalin.
    The funeral on Red Square ended. It became a great demonstration of the solidarity and strength of the Soviet people and the working people of all countries. After this, the Soviet people will transform grief into strength, and with stronger unity and greater labor enthusiasm, devote themselves to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin—the great battle of communism.

    沉痛的悼念，庄严的号召
    ——记莫斯科红场的斯大林追悼大会
    九日早晨，莫斯科的天色与人们分担着哀痛。红场上庄严、肃穆，天空中飘着雪花。
    莫斯科很早就在沉痛中醒来。从清晨起人们就从四面八方聚集到红场上来。到九点半左右，红场的观礼台上，站满了中华人民共和国代表团全体人员，朝鲜、蒙古、越南等亚洲国家的代表，东欧各人民民主国家党和政府的代表，资本主义国家及殖民地附属国的劳动人民和政府的代表，以及苏联武装部队、工人、集体农民和知识分子中的英雄和模范人物。在红场陵墓对面，整齐而威武地排列着苏联军事学院和苏联陆海空军各军事学校学员的行列，他们带着光荣的百战百胜的苏军军旗，来向领导他们从胜利走向胜利的伟大的斯大林致最后的敬礼。在他们后面，是莫斯科市各区劳动人民的代表，他们高举着用黑红两色锦缎镶边的斯大林的巨幅画像。
    十时三十五分，红场上响起了抑扬的哀乐。会场
    一片沉静。人们严肃地起立，注视着送殡的队伍缓缓地从奥霍特尼·里亚德—曼尼日广场进入红场。走在前面的是一长列抬着花圈的队伍。以布琼尼元帅为首的苏军高级将领们双手捧着红色天鹅绒垫子，上面放着苏联政府为了表扬伟大的斯大林的伟大功勋而授给他的耀眼的勋章和奖章。
    在他们之后，由六匹黑马牵引的炮车载来了人类历史的巨人——斯大林同志的遗体。他的遗体安祥地躺在饰以红缎的水晶棺中。灵柩上放着苏联大元帅的军帽。紧接着遗体之后，是长列的送葬行列，为首的第一排是格·马·马林科夫、克·叶·伏罗希洛夫、周恩来、拉·巴·贝利亚、拉·莫·卡冈诺维奇、维·米·莫洛托夫、尼·亚·布尔加宁、尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫。跟着他们的是苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导人和各国共产党与工人党的领导同志，以及苏联人民优秀的代表和许多国家政府的代表。
    过了十分钟，送葬的人在陵墓前止步。在伟大的卫国战争中，在最伟大的统帅斯大林同志的领导下获得了不朽胜利的光荣的苏军的军旗都向前倾斜致敬。灵柩由炮架移到了一个覆着红黑两色旗子的高台上。
    马林科夫、贝利亚、莫洛托夫等苏联党和政府的领导人以及各国兄弟党的领导同志们，就在这时登上了墓台。
    十点五十二分，斯大林治丧委员会主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志代表苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议，宣布追悼大会开始。
    马林科夫同志、贝利亚同志和莫洛托夫同志，相继发表了演说。他们以沉痛的坚强的语调追述了伟大的斯大林在缔造强大的苏维埃国家，在发展马克思列宁主义的民族问题、社会主义经济问题和其他重要问题上的不朽的贡献。他们庄严地号召全体苏联人民共同保证社会主义祖国进一步繁荣，继续加强伟大的共产党，并维护和巩固各国人民的最伟大的成果——和平、民主和社会主义的阵营，加强民主阵营各国人民的友好和团结。
    十一时五十四分，追悼会结束，苏联共产党和苏联政府的领袖们，各兄弟共产党和工人党的领袖们从墓台上走下来。马林科夫、贝利亚、莫洛托夫、伏罗希洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇和米高扬抬起灵柩缓步走入陵墓。陵墓入口处，刻着两个无限亲切与永垂不朽的名字：列宁  斯大林
    红场上的礼炮齐鸣三十响，克里姆林宫斯巴斯基塔的钟敲了十二下。莫斯科和全苏联的所有工厂、机车和船只的汽笛不间断地响了三分钟。这时，苏联全国各地都在为人民的伟大的父亲和导师默哀。在一切地方，从波罗的海沿岸到千岛群岛，所有的工业企业都停工五分钟，火车、汽车和航行在海上的船只也都停下来……全国都为这巨大的丧失而深深哀悼。
    参加葬礼的沉默的人们追忆着伟大的斯大林对全人类的伟大功绩，默念着马林科夫、贝利亚和莫洛托夫的号召。不一会，红场上哀乐停止了，乐队奏起了雄壮的苏联国歌。
    接着，苏联党、政府的领袖和各兄弟国家党、政府的领导同志再度走上陵墓。庄严的阅兵式开始了。这支由斯大林教养的、百战百胜的部队以整齐的步伐走过陵墓、飞机排成整齐的队形在高空中飞翔，向伟大的领袖和统帅约·维·斯大林致敬。
    红场上的葬礼结束了。它成了苏联人民与世界各国劳动人民的团结与力量的巨大示威。在这之后，苏联人民将化悲痛为力量，以更坚强的团结、更高涨的劳动热情，投身于列宁、斯大林的伟大事业——共产主义的伟大战斗之中。
