Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Why is the Fuding Tugboat Docked for a Long Time?
    Gao Zhitong writes: The state-owned China East Inland Water Shipping Company, Anhui Province, Wuhu Company's Fuding tugboat, after being salvaged and repaired in September 1950, has only sailed three or four times and has been docked in the port ever since, for as long as two years and four months. This vessel has 250 horsepower and can tow 2,500 tons. If we calculate the freight cost for grain transportation between Wuhu and Shanghai at 50,000 yuan per ton, the vessel's income from each trip, based on 50% of the freight cost, would reach more than 62 million yuan. Assuming it sails twice a month, it should have sailed 40 times in two years and four months, excluding repair time and time already spent sailing. In other words, the long-term docking of this vessel has caused the state to lose revenue of over 2.5 billion yuan. It is hoped that the China East Inland Water Shipping Company will immediately study and address this issue.

    福鼎拖轮为什么长期停泊
    高志通来信：国营华东内河轮船公司安徽省芜湖公司的福鼎拖轮在一九五○年九月打捞修复后，仅航行三、四次便一直停泊在港内，至今已达两年零四个月之久。该轮为二百五十匹马力，能拖二千五百吨，如以芜湖到上海间粮运每吨运费五万元计算，该轮每次以五成拖运费的收入，即达六千二百余万元。每月以航行两趟计算，两年零四个月中除去修理及已航行时间，还应航行四十趟。就是说，该轮长期停航，已使国家减少收入达二十五亿以上。希望华东内河轮船公司马上去研究处理。
