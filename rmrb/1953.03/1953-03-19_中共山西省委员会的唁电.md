    To the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party:
    In these sorrowful days of Comrade Stalin's passing, we were shocked to learn of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Gottwald, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and President of the Czechoslovak Republic – a prominent activist in the world communist movement and an outstanding fighter for the defense of world peace. With boundless grief, we extend our deepest condolences and express our sincere sympathy to you and to all the Communist Party members and people of Czechoslovakia!
    The entire body of comrades of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the people of the entire province, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, are determined to transform grief into strength, strengthen the close friendship between the Chinese and Czech people, consolidate the world peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, be vigilant against any imperialist conspiracies of aggression and instigation, and fight to the end to defend the cause of world peace and democracy and to realize the cause of communism!
    Eternal Glory to Comrade Gottwald!
                        The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
