    Rescue the Rosenbergs
    Ba Jin
    The American government's preparations for a legal murder are complete, and the lives of two honest and kind young people are under threat. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg are sending out a cry of faith in the pursuit of truth from their death row cells in America. These two people are not only unrelated to the crimes that the American government has placed upon them, they have not committed any crimes at all. Even in death row, they maintain a clear conscience. Like every honest and kind person, they are "loyal to justice and friendship" [Note 1]; they love their own lives and respect the lives of others; they love "peace and bread," and "the innocence of roses and children's laughter." After becoming "victims of political conspiracy," they are still unwilling to "abandon human self-respect," unwilling to "abandon the moral struggle for democracy and ideals." Behind the high walls of Sing Sing prison, they still believe that "humanity cannot be destroyed," still believe that "truth illuminates the eyes of all good people," and still trust that "all people with enough courage, kindness and wisdom" will help them regain their freedom.
    It is such two people, such two kind American citizens, such a young couple who love each other, whom the American Federal Court has sentenced to death on trumped-up charges, the High Court has rejected their appeals, and the American President Eisenhower, disregarding the protests of good people all over the world, has refused to overturn their sentences. Is the door of law closed like this? Is the electric chair waiting for these two innocent people like this? The American ruling class has once again revealed their cruel and bloodthirsty狰狞面目 (猙獰面目: ferocious features) in front of good people all over the world. They want to use the electric chair to answer the protests of good people all over the world and use blood to maintain their barbaric rule. The American ruling class has more than once offended the conscience of the people of the world, and more than once faced the public opinion of the world and shamelessly issued the cheer of "the law has triumphed!" In 1887, the state of Illinois was given the title of "murderer" for hanging five labor activists. In 1927, the state of Massachusetts was called "killer" by the people of the world for killing two Italian workers [Note 2]. In history, no country has ever so violently rejected the just demands and protests of the people of the world as the United States. In the "Nation Weekly" published in New York on August 17, 1927, an American wrote: "Today, wherever the American flag is hung abroad, someone has to protect it; it (the American flag) has become a symbol of great injustice." American law has always been stained with the blood of the innocent. Six years after the Chicago gallows, the new governor of Illinois reviewed the case, issued a proclamation, and confirmed the bribery and perversion of the law by the judge; he even admitted that "such ferocity and cruelty was unprecedented in history"; in the twenty-six years after the Boston electrocution, Massachusetts was never able to wash away its shameful title, and many documents constantly proved that the judge completely based his judgment on class and political prejudice and killed people.
    Now it is the turn of the kind Rosenberg couple to be sacrificed. No matter how many facts prove their innocence, no matter how thousands of good people all over the world demand respect for their lives and a fair trial, the American ruling class is still prepared to use legal murder to maintain its fascist rule. Just as a madman will never stop his crazy behavior himself unless people stop them.
    After Sacco and Vanzetti were burned to death in the electric chair in 1927, the Paris "Daily" wrote the next day: "The crime is complete, and the efforts of the civilized world to oppose the tyranny of injustice have been in vain. We demand justice, we demand leniency... all this is in vain. No one listens to us. At least no one answers us. Fuller (the governor) went to play golf, Coolidge (the president) went fishing. These two innocent people were sacrificed to increase the greater glory of American officials. However, what should we think in this painful time?"
    This is the voice of good people all over the world. Such a cry did not save two innocent people from the electric chair twenty-six years ago. But today we must not let new innocent people die again. Rescuing the Rosenbergs is not only rescuing two young and promising lives, it is defending justice, saving civilization, it is carrying out a struggle between good and evil. This struggle concerns the fate of all good people. We cannot rejoice in our freedom just because we are far away across the ocean. As a member of mankind, we should admit that we are closely related to all good people. As Mrs. Rosenberg said, defending them is defending ourselves; saving civilization is defending the beautiful future of mankind. We must stop this murderous act. Otherwise, what words will we use to answer our children in times of pain! Twenty-six years ago, the Paris "News" wrote: "The curtain of tragedy has fallen. The executioner's arm cannot be held back." But today the good people of the world must not let the historical tragedy repeat itself and must hold the executioner's arm. We have this power, as long as we unite and extend our helping hands and send out our voices of protest.
    Our voices will be sent to the ears of the American people. The American people will reach out to meet our hands. Good people cannot turn a blind eye to the death of their innocent compatriots. They will not forget the painful lessons of history, and they should also remember the glorious tradition of their ancestors in upholding justice and fighting for freedom. Then they should open the gates of the killing field and rescue their suffering compatriots from the conspiracy. In this way, they not only save the reputation of the country, they also defend their own happiness and the future of their children.
    Let us not forget that when the protests of the demonstrating masses shook the doors and windows of the American embassies or consulates abroad, Mrs. Rosenberg wrote letters to her children in the dark prison, she told them: "One thing that troubles me is that I can never find the words to tell you how much I love you."
    A mother's heart is always filled with this kind of love that cannot be explained in words. Every mother understands this kind of love. Everyone who loves their own children must also want all mothers to love their own children. Why do some people still stand by and watch a kind mother endure this kind of pain? Why are some people willing to let a brutal force take away the happiness of those children and make them orphans? Why do some people turn a blind eye and let two innocent people struggle bitterly in the shadow of the electric chair?
    The Rosenbergs are not struggling for themselves. They clearly said: "We don't want to die, we are still young, we need a long and beneficial life." But they are unwilling to "give up all social responsibilities" in exchange for life. "What is the meaning of life without the right to live?" They are conducting this "moral struggle" in order to maintain "human self-respect", to maintain justice, and to "pursue truth". They are convinced that "in the end people will finally understand the meaning of our struggle and join us in the pursuit of truth."
    Join them in the pursuit of truth - it cannot be delayed any longer! All good people should remember their words: "Act quickly" and express the interconnectedness of humanity with practical actions.
    Will our interconnectedness save them from the hands of the executioner? Will it send them back to their happy home, to the children they love? Back to the sunshine, to the free wind, to life, to the midst of good people?
    The answer is in our own mouths. While there is still time, we must show the united strength of good people all over the world.
   [Note 1] The Rosenberg couple's own words, these words are all quoted from their very moving letters.
   [Note 2] On August 31, 1927, the cover of the "Nation Weekly" published in New York was printed with the title of an article in large characters: "Massachusetts, Killer".

    援救罗森堡夫妇
    巴金
    美国政府在法律上大谋杀的准备工作已经完成，两个正直、善良的年青人的生命受到威胁。朱利叶斯和伊斯尔·罗森堡夫妇在美国死囚牢中发出追求真理的信仰呼声。这两个人不但与美国政府加在他们身上的罪名无关，他们也没有犯过任何的罪。就是在死囚牢中他们仍然保持着良心的清白。他们跟每个正直、善良的人一样“忠实于正义和友爱”〔注一〕；他们爱自己的生命，也尊重别人的生命；他们爱“和平与面包”，爱“玫瑰与孩子们的无邪的笑。”他们在做了“政治阴谋的牺牲者”以后，还不愿“放弃人类的自尊”，不愿“放弃为民主、为理想的道德的斗争”。他们在辛辛监狱的高墙后面，还相信“人性不可摧毁”，还相信“真理照亮一切善良的人们的眼睛”，还信赖“一切有足够勇气、善良和明智的人们”会帮助他们恢复自由。
    就是这样的两个人，这样的两个善良的美国公民，这样的一对彼此相爱的年青夫妇，美国联邦法院以莫须有的罪名判决了他们的死刑，高等法院驳回了他们的上诉，美国总统艾森豪威尔不顾全世界善良人民的抗议，拒绝撤销对他们的判决。法律上的门就这样关闭了吗？电刑就这样等待着这两个无罪的人吗？美国统治阶级又一次在全世界善良人民面前显露了他们的残酷嗜杀的狰狞面目。他们想用电椅来回答世界善良人民的抗议，用血来维持他们的野蛮统治。美国的统治阶级不只一次地触怒过世界人民的良心，不只一次地面对着全世界的舆论无耻地发出“法律胜利了！”的欢呼。一八八七年伊利诺斯州因为绞死五个劳动运动者得到“谋杀者”的称号。一九二七年马萨诸塞州因为杀害了两个意大利工人让世界人民称为“凶手”〔注二〕。在历史上从没有一个国家像美国这样横暴地拒绝过世界人民正义的要求和抗议的。一九二七年八月十七日在纽约出版的“民族周刊”上一个美国人写过这样的话：“今天在国外任何一个地方只要挂起美国国旗，就得找人保护；它（美国国旗）已成了大不义的象征了。”美国的法律上一直染满了无辜者的鲜血。在芝加哥绞刑以后六年，伊利诺斯州的新州长曾经复查案件，发布文告，证实法官的受贿枉法，他甚至于承认“这样凶狠残酷为有史以来所未见”；在波士顿电刑以后二十六年中间马萨诸塞州始终无法洗去它的耻辱的称号，许许多多的文件不断地证明法官完全依据阶级的和政治的成见枉法杀人。
    现在又轮到善良的罗森堡夫妇来做牺牲者了。不管有多少事实证明他们清白、无辜，不管全世界千千万万的善良人民怎样要求尊重他们的生命，给他们一个公平的审判，美国统治阶级还是准备用法律的谋杀来维持它的法西斯统治。正如一个狂人决不会自己停止疯狂的举动，除非由人们来制止它们。
    一九二七年沙可和樊才蒂在电椅上烧死以后，第二天的巴黎“日报”上写着：“罪恶完成了，文明世界反对不义的暴政的努力都是白费的了。我们要求正义，要求宽仁……这些都是白费的了。没有人来听我们。至少没有人来答复我们。弗勒（州长）打高尔夫球去了，柯立芝（总统）钓鱼去了。这两个无罪的人为了增加美国官吏的更大光荣而牺牲了。然而我们在这苦痛的时候应当怎样想呢？”
    这是全世界善良人民的呼声。这样的呼声在二十六年前并没有把两个无辜者从电椅上救下来。但是今天我们决不能再让新的无辜者死去。援救罗森堡夫妇，不仅是援救两个年青有为的生命，这是在保卫正义，挽救文明，这是在进行善与恶的斗争。这斗争关系着一切善良人民的命运。我们不能因为远隔重洋而庆幸自己已经得到自由，作为人类一分子，我们就应当承认我们跟一切善良人民的休戚相关。正如罗森堡夫人所说，保卫他们也就是保卫我们自己；挽救文明，也就是保卫人类的美好的将来。我们必须制止这个谋杀的行动。不然，在苦痛的时候我们拿什么话来回答我们的孩子！二十六年前巴黎“新闻报”曾经写过这样的话：“悲剧的幕落下来了。刽子手的胳膊是拉不住的。”可是今天世界善良的人民决不能让历史的悲剧重演，必须拉住刽子手的胳膊。我们有这力量，只要我们团结一致地伸出我们的援救的手，发出我们的抗议的声音。
    我们的声音会送到美国人民的耳边。美国人民会伸出手来迎接我们的手。善良的人民决不能睁着眼睛旁观无辜的同胞的死亡。他们不会忘记历史的惨痛的教训，他们也应当记得祖先们维护正义争取自由的光荣传统。那么他们应当打开杀人场的大门，从阴谋中救出他们的受难的同胞。这样他们不仅挽救了国家的名誉，他们也保卫了自己的幸福和孩子们的将来。
    我们不要忘记，当示威群众的抗议声震动了美国驻外使馆或领事馆的门窗的时候，罗森堡夫人在阴暗的囚牢里给她的孩子们写信，她告诉他们：“有一件事在苦恼着我，就是我永远找不到可以告诉你们我是如何热爱着你们的字句。”
    母亲的心里永远充满着这种不能用言语说明的热爱。每个母亲都了解这样的爱。每个人爱家里的孩子，一定也愿意所有的母亲都爱她们自己的孩子。为什么还有人袖手旁观让一个善良的母亲忍受这种痛苦呢？为什么还有人肯让一种残暴的力量夺去那些孩子的幸福，使他们成为孤儿呢？为什么还有人视若无睹地让两个无罪的人在电椅的阴影下面苦苦地挣扎呢？
    罗森堡夫妇并不是为他们自己在挣扎的。他们明白地说：“我们不愿意死，我们还年青，我们需要长而且有益的生命。”但是他们不愿意“放弃一切社会责任”来换回生命。“没有活的权利，生命有什么意义呢？”他们为了维护“人类的自尊”，为了维护正义，为了“追求真理”，在进行这个“道德的斗争”。他们确信“最后人们终于会明白我们斗争的意义并且和我们结合在一起追求真理”。
    和他们结合在一起追求真理——现在不能再迟疑了！一切善良的人们应当记住他们的话：“快快地行动起来”，用实际的行动来表示人类的休戚相关。
    我们的休戚相关会把他们从刽子手的手中救出来么？会把他们送回到他们的美满的家中，他们所热爱的孩子那里么？送回到阳光，到自由的风，到生活，到善良人民中间来么？
    回答是在我们自己的口中。趁着还来得及的时候，我们必须显出全世界善良人民的团结的力量。
   〔注一〕罗森堡夫妇自己的话，这些话都是从他们的非常感动人的信函中引来的。
   〔注二〕一九二七年八月三十一日在纽约出版的“民族周刊”的封面上用大字印出一篇文章的标题：“马萨诸塞州，凶手”。
