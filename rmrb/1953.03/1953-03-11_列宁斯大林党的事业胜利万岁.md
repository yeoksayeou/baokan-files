    Long Live the Victory of the Cause of the Party of Lenin and Stalin
    After the passing away of the great Comrade Stalin, the Joint Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union made extremely important resolutions, demonstrating the extremely strong and greatest unity of the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. In this resolution, Comrade Malenkov was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and specific measures were taken in the organization of the leading organs of the Party and the state to ensure the uninterrupted and correct leadership of the state life of the Soviet Union. This resolution is of great historical significance. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the entire Soviet people unanimously support this resolution, and our Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people also warmly support this resolution, as do the working people of the whole world.
    Comrade Malenkov said at the Stalin memorial meeting held in Moscow: "Our sacred duty is to continue to strengthen the great Communist Party in the future. The strength and invincibility of our Party lie in the unity of its ranks, the unity of will and action, and in the ability of Party members to integrate their own will with the will and aspirations of the Party. The strength and invincibility of our Party lie in its inseparable connection with the masses of the people." There is no doubt that this complete unity of the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government is the guarantee for the smooth implementation of the domestic and foreign policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and it also demonstrates the invincible strength of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its people.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government headed by Comrade Malenkov, the Soviet people will undoubtedly make new and great contribution to the cause of world peace and democracy, to the cause of building communism, and to the cause of the liberation of all mankind. Because the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded by Lenin and Stalin, is a long-tested and battle-hardened party, because the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, founded by the Party of Lenin and Stalin, is the most powerful country that has victoriously built socialism and is building communism, because the Soviet people nurtured by the Party of Lenin and Stalin are people with indestructible courage and full of firm confidence in their own strength, because all the undertakings carried out by the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet state, and the Soviet people are consistent with the interests and aspirations of all mankind, therefore, our people and the working people of other people's democratic countries, all the working people in capitalist and colonial countries who are struggling for the cause of peace, democracy and socialism, unanimously support all the undertakings carried out by the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet state,and the soviet people.
    Lenin and Stalin's cause is the common cause of the working class and all progressive mankind throughout the world. This cause has already achieved brilliant victories over a vast area of the globe and is constantly developing this victory. In the victorious struggle for this great cause, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people are at the forefront, and they have set a glorious example for us. The working class and all working people of all countries admire the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, and are willing to advance side by side with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people. From here, the extremely strong unity of proletarian internationalism is formed. The closer this unity is, the more invincible our strength becomes.
    This internationalist unity is concretely manifested in the mutual trust, sympathy and support of the working classes and all working people of all countries in their struggle for their own liberation and the liberation of all mankind. As Comrade Stalin said in his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "Our Party and our country have always needed and will continue to need the trust, sympathy and support of the fraternal people of foreign countries. The characteristic of this support is that any support of any fraternal party for our Party's peaceful aspirations is at the same time support for its own people's struggle to safeguard peace." Now, the working class and all working people of the world are more aware of the great necessity of this mutual trust, sympathy and support; they are more aware that the interests of the people of all countries are completely integrated with the interests of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people; and they are also more aware that as long as they are closely united with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, they will certainly be able to defeat all the attacks of the enemies of peace, democracy and socialism, and they will certainly be able to safeguard the peaceful interests of the people of all countries.
    The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people fully support the policies formulated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government in both domestic and international affairs. We fully believe that under the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government headed by Comrade Malenkov, a faithful comrade-in-arms of Comrade Stalin, the domestic and foreign policies of the Soviet Union, which are in line with the fundamental interests of the Soviet people and the peace-loving people of the world, will continue to achieve brilliant victories.
    As the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party said in its telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on March 6: "Our entire Party and the people of the whole country will continue, with the greatest determination, to strengthen our trust and support for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics created by Lenin and Stalin, and consolidate the invincible world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. We will continue to unite forever and closely with you, with the great Soviet people, and under the common banner of Lenin and Stalin, we will fight to the end for the cause of peace and democracy, and for the cause of communism."
    Our Chinese Communist Party will lead the Chinese people to continue to learn from the Soviet Union, continue to take the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people as an example, work hard for our country's economic construction and cultural construction, and always support the great cause of the Party of Lenin and Stalin.
    Long Live the Victory of the Cause of the Party of Lenin and Stalin!

    列宁斯大林党的事业胜利万岁
    在伟大的斯大林同志逝世之后，苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议、苏联最高苏维埃主席团联席全体会议做了非常重要的决议，表现了苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导的极其坚强的最伟大的团结一致。在这个决议中，任命了马林科夫同志为苏联部长会议主席，并在党和国家的领导机构的组织方面采取了若干具体措施，保证着苏联的国家生活得到不间断的正确的领导。这个决议是有重大历史意义的。苏联共产党和苏联全体人民一致支持这个决议，我们中国共产党和中国人民同样热烈支持这个决议，全世界劳动人民也热烈支持这个决议。
    马林科夫同志在莫斯科举行的斯大林追悼大会上说：“我们神圣的责任就是：今后继续加强伟大的共产党。我们党的力量和不可战胜性在于它的队伍的团结一致，意志和行动的一致，在于党员善于把自己的意志和党的意志及愿望融合在一起。我们党的力量和不可战胜性在于和人民群众有着不可分的联系。”毫无疑义，苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导的这种完全团结一致，正是苏联共产党和苏联政府的内外政策顺利实施的保证，也正是说明了苏联共产党和苏联人民的不可战胜的力量。
    在以马林科夫同志为首的苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，苏联人民对于世界和平民主的事业，对于建设共产主义的事业，对于全人类解放的事业，无疑地将会有新的巨大贡献。由于列宁斯大林所缔造的苏联共产党是久经考验的百炼成钢的党，由于列宁斯大林党所缔造的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟是胜利地建成了社会主义和建设着共产主义的最强大的国家，由于列宁斯大林党所培育的苏联人民是有着不可摧毁的勇气并对自己的力量充满坚定信心的人民，由于列宁斯大林的党、苏维埃国家和苏联人民所进行的全部事业都是和全人类的利益和愿望相一致的，所以我国人民及其他人民民主国家的劳动人民，一切为和平、民主和社会主义事业而斗争的各资本主义和殖民地国家的劳动人民，都一致支持列宁斯大林的党、苏维埃国家和苏联人民所进行的全部事业。
    列宁斯大林的事业是全世界工人阶级和一切进步人类的共同事业。这个事业现在已经在全地球的广大面积上取得了辉煌的胜利，而且正在不断地发展这个胜利。在为这个伟大的事业而进行的胜利的斗争中，苏联共产党和苏联人民是走在最前面的，他们给我们立下了光荣的榜样。世界各国的工人阶级和一切劳动人民都敬佩苏联共产党和苏联人民，愿与苏联共产党和苏联人民并肩前进。由这里就形成了无产阶级的国际主义的极其强大的团结。这种团结越紧密，我们的力量就越发不可战胜。
    这种国际主义的团结具体地表现在各国工人阶级和一切劳动人民在为自己解放和全人类解放的事业而进行的斗争中的互相的信任、同情和支持。正如斯大林同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说中所说的：“我们党和我们国家过去始终需要，而且将来仍然需要外国兄弟人民的信任、同情和支持。这种支持的特点就在于：任何兄弟党对我们党的和平愿望的一切支持，同时也就是对其本国人民的维护和平的斗争的支持。”现在，全世界工人阶级和一切劳动人民更加认识了这种相互的信任、同情和支持的极大必要性；更加认识了各国人民的利益，与苏联共产党和苏联人民的利益完全融合在一起；也更加认识了只要与苏联共产党和苏联人民紧紧地团结一致，就一定能够战胜和平、民主和社会主义的敌人的一切进攻，就一定能够维护各国人民的和平利益。
    中国共产党和中国人民完全支持苏联共产党和苏联政府所制订的国内事务和国际事务两方面的政策。我们完全相信，在以斯大林同志的忠实战友马林科夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的坚强的领导之下，符合于苏联人民和全世界爱好和平人民的根本利益的苏联对内和对外政策，必将继续获得光辉的胜利。
    正如中国共产党中央委员会三月六日致苏联共产党中央委员会的电文中说的：“我们全党和全国人民，将继续以最大的坚定性，加强对于列宁斯大林所创造的苏联共产党和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的信任和支持，巩固以苏联为首的不可战胜的世界和平民主阵营。我们将继续和你们，和伟大的苏联人民，永远地紧紧地团结在一起，在列宁斯大林这一个共同的旗帜下，为和平与民主的事业，为共产主义的事业，奋斗到底。”
    我们中国共产党将领导中国人民，继续努力向苏联学习，继续以苏联共产党和苏联人民为榜样，努力于我国的经济建设和文化建设，永远支持列宁斯大林党的伟大事业。
    列宁斯大林党的事业胜利万岁！
