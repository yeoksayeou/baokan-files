Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th. TASS reported from Moscow on the 6th: Members of Communist and Workers' Parties, the broad masses of working people and progressive intellectuals in many countries around the world are studying J.V. Stalin's work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" with great interest. "Pravda" wrote today that hundreds of thousands of copies of this great work have been published in France. The newspapers of the French Communist Party and progressive newspapers have published dozens of articles introducing J.V. Stalin's work. The provincial committees of the French Communist Party have received many letters expressing great interest in J.V. Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR."

"Pravda" reported that the various party schools of the French Communist Party, and specially formed groups, have already begun to systematically study J.V. Stalin's work, and some are studying it individually. The leading bodies and members of many progressive organizations, many Socialist Party workers and non-Party working people are also studying this work.

In Belgium, Communists and many progressives are attending lectures and reports on Stalin's great work, or studying it on their own.

The Political Bureau of the Belgian Communist Party passed a resolution to organize all members of the Belgian Communist Party to study J.V. Stalin's work and the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In order to implement this resolution, "The Red Flag" published materials to assist in the study of J.V. Stalin's work. These materials explain that the economic situation in Belgium fully confirms Stalin's analysis of the modern capitalist situation.

"Pravda" reported that not long ago, a theoretical research conference was held in Rome to discuss J.V. Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR". Participants in the conference included leaders of the Italian Communist Party, intellectuals, and heads of various people's organizations. Emilio Sereni, a well-known Italian social leader, delivered a report on J.V. Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" at the meeting. Sereni emphasized that this work is of great historical significance for the further creative development of Marxism-Leninism and for guiding the practical activities and struggles of the working-class parties.

    各国共产党、工人党和劳动人民怀着无限热情
    学习斯大林巨著“苏联社会主义经济问题”
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：世界上许多国家的共产党和工人党的党员，广大的劳动人民和进步的知识分子正怀着极大的兴趣研究约·维·斯大林的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。“真理报”今天写道，这本伟大著作在法国出版了几十万册。法国共产党的报纸和进步的报纸发表了几十篇文章，介绍约·维·斯大林的这部著作。法国共产党各省党委会收到了很多信件，对约·维·斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”表示极大兴趣。
    “真理报”报道，现在法国共产党的各个党校，专门成立的小组，已经开始有系统地学习约·维·斯大林的这部著作，也有进行个人学习的。许多进步团体的领导机关和会员，许多社会党的工人和无党派的劳动人民也在学习这一著作。
    在比利时，共产党人和许多进步分子去听关于斯大林这一伟大著作的讲演和报告，或是各自进行学习。
    比利时共产党政治局通过了一项决议，组织比利时共产党全体党员学习约·维·斯大林的这本著作和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文件。为了执行这一决议，“红旗报”登载了帮助学习约·维·斯大林这一著作的材料。这些材料说明比利时的经济情况完全证实了斯大林对于现代资本主义状况的分析。
      “真理报”报道，不久以前，在罗马举行了研究理论的会议，讨论了约·维·斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”。参加这次会议的有意大利共产党的领导人、知识分子和各人民团体的负责人。意大利著名的社会领袖埃米略·塞伦尼在这次会上发表了关于约·维·斯大林“苏联社会主义经济问题”的报告。塞伦尼强调这一著作对于进一步创造性地发展马克思列宁主义，对指导工人阶级政党的实际活动和斗争有巨大的历史意义。
