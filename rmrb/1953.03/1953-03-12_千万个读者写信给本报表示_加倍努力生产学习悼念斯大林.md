Editor's Note: The unfortunate news of the passing of Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, has caused infinite grief to all the Chinese people. Letters mourning Comrade Stalin's death have been flying in like snowflakes from every corner of the country. In the past few days, we have received tens of thousands of letters from readers, written individually or jointly, expressing the most sincere feelings of the Chinese people for their great revolutionary teacher. The letter writers all pledged to respond to Chairman Mao's call to transform grief into strength and to commemorate Comrade Stalin with practical actions; some letters also put forward specific suggestions for commemorating and learning from Comrade Stalin. Now, we are selecting and publishing excerpts from some of the letters below:

	Fuxin Mining Bureau Workers Solemnly Swear
	To Learn from Soviet Experience to Build a Great Motherland

	Letter from all workers of Fuxin Mining Bureau: The news of the passing of Marshal Stalin has deeply saddened all of us. In the past, we, like the coal miners of pre-revolutionary Russia, lived a life of hell on earth. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, today Soviet miners live a happy life; the world of the mines has been fundamentally changed. We firmly believe that the Soviet mine of today is our tomorrow.

	Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, all the workers of Fuxin Mine have been transformed from slaves to masters of the mine. During the restoration and construction of Fuxin Mine, Comrade Stalin sent many Soviet experts to help us selflessly with the spirit of internationalism, building China's first new type of open-pit mine. We have actively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and have achieved initial successes, with the emergence of advanced workers such as Ma Wenzhi's rapid drilling, Gu Faming's rapid well construction, Zhang Yihou's rapid tunneling, Tian Chengfu's 20,000-ton working face, Zhou Xiuwen's advanced electric shovel driving skills, and the formwork bricklaying method in civil engineering. As production increases, our material and cultural life has also improved, which is inseparable from the help given to us by the experts sent by Comrade Stalin.

	Comrade Stalin's death is an inestimable loss to the working people of the world. We know that Comrade Stalin dedicated his most precious life entirely to the cause of the liberation of the working class; we must take on his unfinished work. We are determined to transform grief into strength, increase vigilance, strengthen the unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union and the working class and peace-loving people of the world, and combat the instigators of war.

	All the workers of Fuxin Mine solemnly swear to Comrade Stalin:

	We will work a hundred times harder, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve work efficiency and quality, and accelerate the industrialization of our great motherland.

	Fengtai Vehicle Depot Workers Transform
	Infinite Grief into Immense Power in Production

	Letter from Chen Bingwen: The workers of the Fengtai Vehicle Depot of the Beijing Railway Administration have transformed their infinite grief at the mourning of Comrade Stalin into immense power in production. In the past, it was already very difficult to repair eight vehicles a day. But on the 7th, before 5 pm (quitting time is 6 pm), ten damaged freight cars had already been repaired. On the evening of the 7th, all the workers of the depot held a memorial service. Zhang Jie, the depot chief, and Wang Lin, the party branch secretary, both called on all workers to actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, strive to find tricks, tap potential, increase production, and draw up and complete production plans, using these practical actions to mourn Comrade Stalin. On the morning of the 9th, each production team held a chat, and everyone made a guarantee. Lu Jinglin of the welding room guaranteed that he would never burn off screws that could be removed in the future. Chu Yuhai, who manages the spare parts rack, proposed to ensure a constant supply of materials in the future, and to return unused materials on the rack to the warehouse, reducing the occupation of working capital; after he reorganized the rack, he saved more than 12 million yuan in working capital. Bai Qingrong of the brake group voluntarily handed over 124 undocumented elbow stopper doors (worth more than 28 million yuan) that he had saved, and guaranteed to eliminate small warehouses and improve economic accounting in the future.

	Workers at the Construction Site of the
	Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital Guarantee
	to Finish Building the Hospital Building Ahead of Schedule

	Letter from Cao Jianqiu, Sun Jinming, and 97 other workers at the construction site of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital: We mourn the passing of Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, with immense grief. The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, which we are responsible for building, is a gift of friendship from the Soviet people to the Chinese people and is one of the manifestations of the great Comrade Stalin's deep concern for the Chinese people. We guarantee that under the leadership of the Communist Party and our superiors, we will study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve work efficiency and project quality, and finish building the building ahead of schedule, as an action to commemorate Comrade Stalin.

	National Labor Model Liu Yingyuan
	Determined to Strive to Complete the Construction Plan

	Letter from National Labor Model Liu Yingyuan: I felt an unprecedented sadness upon hearing the unfortunate news of the passing of the great Comrade Stalin, even more painful than losing my parents. Comrade Stalin, you shone upon us like the sun, illuminating the revolutionary path of the world. You armed the minds of the working class. Under your sincere and selfless help and the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our long-oppressed people were liberated, and we workers became masters of the country. You have parted forever with the Soviet people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world. This is the greatest misfortune for the working people of the world. We must turn our immense grief into infinite strength, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we are determined to complete our economic construction plan. Your immortal revolutionary theory will inspire and urge us to move towards a socialist and communist society.

	Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team Peasants
	Mourn Stalin by Increasing Production

	Letter from Gong Yuesu: On the morning of March 7, the unfortunate news of Comrade Stalin's passing reached the Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Team in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, immediately causing the greatest grief among the peasants. They recalled Comrade Stalin's great help to our country's peasants, saying: Chinese peasants have suffered for thousands of years, and being able to stand up today is the road opened up for us by Stalin; the path of organizing collective farms taken by Soviet peasants under Stalin's leadership is precisely the path to happiness that Chinese peasants must take. Chen Yongkang said: "Some time ago, Soviet agricultural experts and TASS reporters came here and gave us a lot of valuable guidance in farming techniques. These are all inseparable from Comrade Stalin's concern for us peasants." Based on their personal experiences, the peasants sincerely proposed that in order to commemorate Comrade Stalin, we must step up production, increase yields, support the Korean War to Resist U.S. Aggression and aid Korea and the industrial construction of the motherland; under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we must unite more firmly with the Soviet Union and defend the cause of world peace.

	Convalescing Veterans of the Chinese People's
	Volunteer Army at Beijing Army Hospital
	Strive to Return to the Korean Front as Soon as Possible

	Letter from all convalescing veterans of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army at Beijing Army Hospital: We felt as if our hearts were being cut when we heard the unfortunate news of Comrade Stalin's passing on our sickbeds. Everyone swore that in these unfortunate days, we must learn from the example of the heroic Soviet people and fight to complete the cause left behind by Stalin. We must unite even more closely with the Soviet people and dedicate all our strength to our common cause of defending lasting world peace. Therefore, everyone guarantees to rest assuredly, strive to recover as soon as possible, and return to the front line to fight for the final victory of the Korean War to Resist U.S. Aggression and aid Korea.

	Staff of the Mathematics Institute of the Academy of Sciences
	Guarantee to Study Advanced Soviet Science Diligently

	Letter from Tian Fangzeng, Wan Zhexian, Guan Zhaozhi, and 27 other staff members of the Mathematics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: Although Comrade Stalin has left us, his theories will forever guide us forward. We believe that there will be thousands upon thousands of people who are determined to dedicate themselves unreservedly to the cause left behind by Comrade Stalin, so that the great cause of Stalin will flourish vigorously. Like Comrade Lenin, Comrade Stalin will always live in our hearts.

	We solemnly express that in order to commemorate the unfortunate passing of Comrade Stalin, we must strive to learn Comrade Stalin's immortal theories and his noble qualities of dedicating his life unreservedly to the working class and the cause of liberation of the working people of the world, and inherit the great cause left behind by Comrade Stalin. We must resolutely respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, unite more closely with the Soviet people and all peace-loving people of the world, heighten our vigilance, and shatter any aggressive conspiracies of imperialism. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we must continue to strengthen the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and aid Korea and diligently study advanced Soviet science to build our motherland.

	Finally, please convey to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people our condolences and sympathy for the unfortunate passing of Comrade Stalin, as well as our determination to fight resolutely to realize Comrade Stalin's behests.

	Old Artists Wang Yaoqing, Xiao Changhua, etc.
	Will Use Artistic Weapons to Serve the People

	Letter from old artists Wang Yaoqing, Xiao Changhua, Shang Heyu, Hao Shouchang, Tan Xiaopei, Wang Fengqing, Ma Decheng, Zhang Dejun, Jiang Miaoxiang, Liu Xikui, Yang Yunpu, Li Guichun, and Bao Jixiang: We heard the news of the passing of Marshal Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, on the radio, and we simply couldn't believe it was true, but the radio clearly told us that he had parted ways with us forever! This is truly a world-shaking grief!

	We are all old artists of New China, the oldest of whom are already in their eighties. We have experienced several major changes in modern Chinese history! The declining Qing Dynasty, the warlord-ridden "Republic of China," the barbaric rule of the enemy and puppets, and Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country for personal glory. It was not until the Communist Party liberated all of China and Chairman Mao led us to turn ourselves over that we saw the light of day and became masters of the country. Artists who were once humiliated and looked down upon have become artists respected by the people.

	There is an old Chinese saying: "When drinking water, think of its source." One must not forget the fundamentals. If it were not for Marshal Stalin's guidance and help to the Chinese revolution, our Chinese revolution would not have been victorious and the country would not have been built so quickly, and we would not be living such a peaceful and happy life today. When we heard the news of his death, we felt as painful as if we had lost our parents. We have experienced countless ups and downs in the world, and we have never encountered anything more heartbreaking than this!

	Marshal Stalin called us art workers "engineers of the soul," which means that we should use art as a weapon to educate the people and the masses, and serve the people and the country loyally. We will definitely follow this instruction and do our job well to commemorate Marshal Stalin!

	Marshal Stalin has parted ways with us forever, but his cause and his kindness to the Chinese people will never be forgotten by our children and grandchildren for generations to come!

	Respected Marshal Stalin, is a glorious, great, immortal, forever living in our hearts mentor!

	Stalin's Concern for Chinese Youth
	Encourages Us to Redouble Our Efforts to Move Forward

	Letter from all trainees in the Department of Public Health of the China Union Medical College: On the afternoon of March 6, we had been concerned about Comrade Stalin's health. However, while attending a class on troop health services, the broadcast announced the major unfortunate news that Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world and the closest friend of the Chinese people, had passed away! At that time, under the leadership of the teacher, we all stood up and observed a moment of silence to express our infinite mourning for Comrade Stalin. Then the teacher said to us gravely: "We will continue the class now. Today's lesson is on the advanced experience of the Soviet Red Army's health work under the personal leadership of Comrade Stalin. And our learning this lesson is to strengthen national defense and defend the cause of peace led by Comrade Stalin." We have never had such a deep experience as we do today. Our daily study, our lifelong ideals, and our entire lives are closely linked to the leadership and concern of Comrade Stalin.

	We remember that Comrade Stalin especially cared for Chinese youth. Comrade Stalin's requirements for us Chinese youth are the guidelines for our actions. Thinking of this, we feel that there is a force pushing us at all times. The portrait of Comrade Stalin hanging in the classroom seems to be encouraging us to move forward. We think that we have contributed too little to the revolution, we have not studied hard enough, we have not been concerned and helped each other enough...; We feel that we have no reason not to demand ourselves to study and work harder, and dedicate everything we have to the arduous tasks of completing the construction of the motherland and the cause of world peace.

	All the Students of the Northwest Nursery Primary School
	Will Dedicate Themselves to Stalin's Cause When They Grow Up

	Letter from all the students of the Northwest Nursery Primary School in Xi'an: After hearing the news of Uncle Stalin's illness, all 860 students in our school were very uneasy and anxious, wishing we could fly to Moscow to see him. On the afternoon of March 6, the unfortunate news of Uncle Stalin's passing was broadcast, and we immediately felt extremely heartbroken. When the dinner bell rang, we still surrounded the radio and did not leave, still wanting to wait for the news that Uncle Stalin had been resurrected.

	How much Uncle Stalin loved us children! When we saw the photo of Uncle Stalin holding a child on the reviewing stand in Red Square, we felt extremely happy. Because Uncle Stalin was holding not just one child, but all the children in the world. Uncle Stalin's life was entirely devoted to the happiness of our next generation.

	Uncle Stalin has passed away, but we are mourning him every minute, and he will always live in our hearts. We must study hard, exercise, and dedicate our lives to the revolutionary cause left behind by Uncle Stalin when we grow up in the future.

	All Party Members and League Members of the Central Song and Dance Troupe, etc.
	Swear Loyalty to the Cause of Communism

	The letter from all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and trade union members of the Central Song and Dance Troupe stated: We are in unspeakable grief when we heard the most unfortunate news—that our most respected leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin, had left us. We could not restrain ourselves and cried excitedly. Comrade Stalin, you left us at a time when the world's peace forces are unprecedentedly high, and when mankind is approaching the greatest happiness—the era of communism. This is a loss to us that cannot be compared to anything. Our hearts flew to the Kremlin, and our hearts were tightly attached to its walls, as if we could hear Stalin's heart still beating!

	When our tears were not yet dry, we thought that we should turn grief into strength: We must inherit Stalin's cause; we must learn from his great personality; learn from his noble spirit of "dedicating his life unreservedly to the people." At this sad and solemn moment, we all realized our responsibilities.

	Facing the direction of Moscow, we made a heartfelt oath to Comrade Stalin:

	1. Be loyal to Stalin's cause—the cause of communism!

	2. Intensify the transformation of our thinking and strive towards Stalin's standard—dedicating our lives unreservedly to the people!

	3. Study Stalin's works, learn Stalin's glorious and great character, and fight to the end for the complete victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, the liberation of all mankind, and the cause of world peace! Our most respected teacher, the great Stalin, will live forever!

	Students of Class 2, Grade 3 of the Third Department of the High School Affiliated to the Normal University
	Strive for Progress and Strive to Join the Party and the League

	Letter from Class 2, Grade 3 of the Third Department of the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University: Comrade Stalin has passed away. The mood of all the students in the school is very heavy. Several of us students chatted together, and everyone sadly expressed their inner thoughts: Di Yuhua, who had always been relatively silent, said excitedly: "Stalin had already determined his life goal at a young age, but what about me? ... Stalin is dead, and I can no longer be muddled." Wang Ali firmly stated: "I want to overcome all difficulties and demand myself according to the standards of a party member, strive to join the party before graduation, and realize Stalin's ideals!" Zhang Xiuying said: "Although I have been approved by the party branch, the district has not yet approved it. If it is approved, I must become a force for the party to promote work; if it is not approved, it means that I still have many shortcomings, and I must continue to work hard, overcome my shortcomings, and strive to join the party." Comrade Qi Zhimin went on to say: "Now that our dear teacher is dead, I want to express in front of his portrait: I must take the initiative to ask for progress in the future and strive to join the Communist Youth League before graduation." Comrade Yan Meilan recalled the painful life in Malaya: "I suffered all kinds of enslavement from imperialist elements. I returned to China, and under the education of the Party and the League, I recognized the future of communism and found my life goal. I joined the League, and I live and study happily. This is Stalin's lighthouse of reason illuminating my way forward." Comrade Rui Shizhuang said: "In order to inherit Stalin's cause, I must no longer be troubled by personal problems. I am determined to obey the assignment, and I will go wherever I am needed." Finally, the students raised their right hands in front of Comrade Stalin's portrait and swore an oath. We must turn grief into strength, work and study harder, learn from Comrade Stalin's spirit of striving wholeheartedly for the happiness of mankind, unite closely, inherit Comrade Stalin's great cause, and fight to the end.

	I Want to Be a Good Son and Daughter of Mao Zedong

	Letter from Wang Hongzhi: The heart of the brilliant and great revolutionary teacher—Stalin—has stopped beating. This news has caused me a grief that I have never experienced in my life.

	In the long and mournful dirge, I shed tears, I grieve for Stalin's death, I grieve for not having followed his instructions and trained myself into a revolutionary cadre worthy of the name!

	Before, when he was alive, I did not study hard, I was not at ease in my work, I was moody, I allowed my shortcomings to exist without correcting them, and I did not serve the people wholeheartedly; if I only know how to grieve after he dies, that is also wrong. Stalin would never like such a person, and he would never want such a person to mourn him.

	The past is gone, and it cannot be recovered! But in the future, I want to be a good son and daughter of Mao Zedong. Although I am not a party member, nor a League member, I want to turn myself into a person who can actively implement the party's resolutions and policies.

	Comrade Editor: When you have compiled the thoughts of so many people, if there is an opportunity, or if someone else has the opportunity, to pay tribute to Stalin's tomb, please convey my wishes along with you, tell him, please forgive my past, I will use the practical action of correcting my mistakes to mourn him.

    学习苏联经验建设伟大祖国
    阜新矿务局全体职工来信：斯大林大元帅病逝的噩耗传来，我们全体职工深为悲痛。我们过去和革命前俄国的煤矿工人一样，过着人间地狱的生活。在斯大林同志的领导下，今天苏联的矿工过着幸福的生活；根本改变了矿山的天地。我们深信：苏联矿山的今天就是我们的明天。
    我们阜新矿全体职工，在毛主席领导下已经从奴隶的地位变成了矿山的主人。在阜新矿的恢复与建设中，斯大林同志派来很多苏联专家，以国际主义精神无私地帮助我们，建设了中国第一个新型露天矿。我们积极学习苏联先进经验，获得了初步的成就，出现了马文志的快速探钻、谷发明的快速建井、张义厚的快速掘进、田成富的两万吨掌子、周秀文先进电铲司机手、土建的模板砌砖法等先进工作者。随着生产的提高，我们的物质文化生活也提高了，这些都是与斯大林同志派来的专家所给予我们的帮助分不开的。
    斯大林同志的逝世是世界劳动人民的不可估量的损失。我们知道：斯大林同志把他最宝贵的生命完全贡献给工人阶级的解放事业；他的未完事业，我们一定要承担起来。我们决心化悲痛为力量，提高警惕、加强中苏两国人民和全世界工人阶级及爱好和平的人民的团结，打击战争挑拨者。

    陈永康互助组农民

    龚樾苏来信：三月七日清晨，斯大林同志逝世的不幸消息传到了江苏省松江县陈永康互助组，立刻引起农民们最大的悲痛。他们回忆了斯大林同志对我国农民的巨大帮助，说：中国农民几千年来受苦受难，今朝能翻身就是斯大林给我们开辟的道路；斯大林领导苏联农民走的组织集体农庄的道路，也正是中国农民要走的幸福道路。陈永康说：“前些时，苏联农业专家和塔斯社记者到我们这里来，在耕作技术上给了我们很多宝贵的指导。这些都和斯大林同志关心我们农民分不开的。”农民们根据切身的体会，真心诚意地提出：为了纪念斯大林同志，一定要加紧生产，提高产量，支援抗美援朝和祖国工业建设；要在毛主席领导下，和苏联团结得更加牢固，保卫世界和平事业。

    老艺人王瑶卿、萧长华等
    要用艺术武器为人民服务
    老艺人王瑶卿、萧长华、尚和玉、郝寿臣、谭小培、王凤卿、马德成、张德俊、姜妙香、刘喜奎、杨韵谱、李桂春、鲍吉祥来信：我们在无线电广播里听到苏联部长会议主席斯大林大元帅逝世的消息，简直不敢相信这是真事，可是无线电清清楚楚的告诉我们，他老人家和我们永别了！这真是震撼天地的大悲伤！
    我们都是新中国的老艺人，年纪最大的已有八十几岁，我们经过了中国近代史上的几次大变动！衰亡的满清王朝，军阀混战的“民国”，敌伪时期的野蛮统治，蒋介石的卖国求荣。到共产党解放了全中国，毛主席领导我们翻了身，我们才算见了天日，做了国家的主人，过去受人作践瞧不起的艺人，成了受人民尊敬的艺术家。
    中国有句古话：“饮水思源”，凡事不能忘了根本，要是没有斯大林大元帅对于中国革命的指导和帮助，我们中国革命的胜利，国家的建设哪能这样快，我们哪能过今天这样和平幸福的日子。当我们听到他老人家逝世的消息时，就如同失掉父母一样的沉痛，我们经过了无数世事的沉浮，从没有遇到过比这更伤心的事！
    斯大林大元帅把我们做艺术工作的叫做“灵魂的工程师”，就是要我们用艺术这个武器教育人民、教育群众，为人民、国家效忠服务。我们一定遵照这个遗训，做好自己的工作，来纪念斯大林大元帅！
    斯大林大元帅和我们永别了，可是他的事业，对于我们中国人民的恩惠，直到我们子孙万代都永远不会忘记的！
    敬爱的斯大林大元帅，是光荣的、伟大的、不朽的、永远活在我们心里的导师！
    斯大林对中国青年的关怀
    鼓舞我们加倍努力地前进
    中国协和医学院公共卫生系全体进修生来信：三月六日下午，我们一直关怀着斯大林同志的健康情况。但正在上部队卫生勤务课时，广播器里传来重大的不幸消息，全世界劳动人民伟大的领袖和导师、中国人民最亲密的朋友斯大林同志逝世了！当时，我们在教师的领导下，全体起立默哀，表示对斯大林同志无限的哀悼。接着教师沉重地对我们说：“我们现在继续上课。今天我们所学的课，就是斯大林同志亲自领导下苏联红军卫生工作的先进经验。而我们学这门课，也就是为了加强国防，保卫斯大林同志所领导的和平事业。”我们大家都从来没有过像今天这样深切的体会。我们日常的学习，我们终身的理想，我们全部生活，都是紧紧的和斯大林同志的领导和关怀分不开的。
    我们记得：斯大林同志特别关怀中国青年。斯大林同志对我们中国青年的要求，就是我们行动的准绳。想到这，我们感到随时都有一股力量在推动我们。挂在教室里的斯大林同志的画像好像在鼓舞着我们前进。我们想到我们自己对革命贡献太少，学习不够刻苦努力，对同志不够关心互助……；我们感到我们没有理由不要求自己加倍努力学习和工作，为完成祖国建设和世界和平事业的艰巨任务而献出自己的一切。
    西北保育小学校全体同学
    长大后要献身给斯大林的事业
    西安市西北保育小学校全体同学来信：听到斯大林伯伯患病的消息后，我们全校八百六十个同学都非常不安和焦急，恨不得插翅飞到莫斯科去看看他。三月六日下午，广播机中传出斯大林伯伯逝世的不幸消息，我们顿时感到心痛万分。吃饭铃响了，我们还围着广播器不走，还想等待着报告斯大林伯伯复活的消息。
    斯大林伯伯是多么热爱我们儿童啊！当我们看到斯大林伯伯在红场检阅台上抱着一个孩子的照片时，我们感到幸福极了。因为斯大林伯伯怀里抱的不只是一个孩子，而是全世界的儿童。斯大林伯伯的一生精力，就是完全用来为了我们下一代的幸福的。
    斯大林伯伯逝世了，但是我们每一分钟都在悼念着他，他永远活在我们心里。我们一定要好好学习，锻炼身体，将来长大了把生命献给斯大林伯伯遗下的革命事业。
    中央歌舞团全体党团员等
    宣誓忠实于共产主义事业
    中央歌舞团全体共产党员、青年团员、中苏友好协会会员、工会会员的来信中说：我们是处在难以言语形容的悲痛里，当我们听到了这个最不幸的消息——最敬爱的领袖和导师斯大林同志离开了我们——的时候。我们难以抑制自己，激动地痛哭起来。斯大林同志，正当全世界和平力量空前高涨的时代，正当人类一步步接近最大幸福——共产主义的时代，您离开了我们。这对我们是什么也不能比拟的损失。我们的心飞到了克里姆林宫，我们的心紧紧贴着它的宫墙，像是听到斯大林的心脏还在跳动！
    当我们泪水未干的时候，我们就想到，应该化悲痛为力量：我们要继承斯大林的事业；我们要学习他伟大的人格；学习他“把自己的一生毫无保留地献给人民”的崇高的精神。在这悲痛的庄严的时刻，我们都意识到了自己的责任。
    向着莫斯科的方向，我们向斯大林同志发出心底的誓言：
    一、忠实于斯大林的事业——共产主义的事业！
    二、加紧改造自己的思想，向着斯大林的标准——把自己的一生毫无保留地献给人民——而努力前进！
    三、学习斯大林的著作，学习斯大林的光辉伟大的品格，为中国人民革命事业的彻底胜利，和全人类的解放、全世界的和平事业而奋斗到底！我们最敬爱的导师伟大的斯大林永垂不朽！
    师大附中三部高三二班学生
    要力求进步争取入党入团
    北京师范大学附属中学三部高三二班来信：斯大林同志逝世了。全校同学的心情都很沉重。我们几个同学在一起漫谈，大家都沉痛地说出了自己的心里话：一向比较沉默的邸玉华激动地说：“斯大林在年幼的时候，已经确定了他的生活目标，可是我呢？……斯大林死了，我再也不能糊涂下去了。”王阿立坚决地表示：“我要克服一切困难，按照党员的标准要求自己，争取毕业前入党，实现斯大林的理想！”张秀英说：“我虽然已被党支部通过了，可是区里还没批下来。如果批准了，我一定要成为党推动工作的力量；如果批不准，那就是我的缺点还多，我一定要继续努力，克服缺点，争取入党。”齐之敏同学接着说：“现在我们亲爱的导师死了，我要在他的像前表示：今后一定要主动要求进步，争取在毕业前参加到青年团内来。”颜梅兰同学回忆起在马来亚的痛苦生活：“我曾受尽了帝国主义分子的奴役。我回国了，在党和团的教育下，我认识了共产主义的前途，找到了生活目标。我入了团，我幸福地生活、学习，这是斯大林理智的灯塔给我照明了前进的途程。”瑞世庄同学说：“为了继承斯大林的事业，我决不能再为个人问题而苦恼了。我决心服从分配，哪儿需要我，我就上哪儿去。”最后，同学们在斯大林同志的遗像前，举起了右手宣誓。我们一定把悲痛化为力量，加倍地努力学习和工作，学习斯大林同志全心全意为人类幸福而奋斗的精神，紧密团结，继承斯大林同志的伟大事业，而奋斗到底。
    我要做一个毛泽东的好儿女
    王鸿志来信：英明伟大的革命导师——斯大林的心脏停止跳动了，这个消息，引起我个人有生以来从未有过的沉痛。
    在漫长凄楚的哀乐声中，我掉泪，我为了斯大林的逝世，我为了自己没有按照他的指示，把自己锻炼成一个像点样的革命干部而悲痛！
    以前，他活着，自己不学好，工作不安心，闹情绪，任凭自己的缺点存在不去改正，不全心全意的为人民服务；他死了，自己如果只知道悲痛，那也不对。斯大林绝不会喜欢这样人的，他也绝不会愿意这样的人来追悼他。
    以前的过去了，追不回来了！但今后，我要，要做一个毛泽东的好儿女，我虽然不是一个党员，也不是个团员，但我要，一定要把自己变成一个能积极执行党的决议及政策的人。
    编辑同志：当你汇总了许许多多人的感想后，如果有机会，或者别人有机会，能到斯大林墓前致敬的时候，请捎带着把我的愿望加进去，祝告给他，请他原恕我的以往，我将用改正错误的实际行动来悼念他。
