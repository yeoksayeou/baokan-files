Those Who Explore the Underground Treasures of the Motherland
范荣康 (Fan Rongkang)

    On the mainland of the motherland, many places where no one has ever walked before now often see groups of people carrying instruments. These people climb high mountains and cliffs, living in desolate mountains and grasslands year after year. This is the geological exploration team of New China. Bearing the hopes of the people of the motherland, they travel through thousands of mountains and rivers, seeking the minerals that have been sleeping underground for hundreds of millions of years. They want countless new factories and mines to be built on the land they have traversed. The people of the motherland call them the outposts of economic construction.

    Treasures Sold Out and Trampled Upon

    People still remember that China was once described as a beggar holding a golden bowl begging for food. Many people were troubled by the fact that China's vast land and abundant resources did not help the people's poverty. At that time, many people dreamed of developing the underground treasures, and some even directly participated in geological work. However, in old China, geological work was strangled. The Kuomintang sold out the national treasures, and the imperialists regarded China's mineral resources as their own.

    In a manganese mine area in Jiangxi, messy mine pits lay in the mountains and fields, as if a war had taken place there not long ago. Japanese imperialists were once the owners here. They plundered the manganese ore here, forcing farmers to mine with whips and boots. All the ore was transported to the Yawata Iron and Steel Works in Japan. What was left was this mess of mine pits.

    Anyone who has been concerned about China's mineral resources will never forget that China was once called an oil-poor country. Many people quoted "classics" saying that oil basically only exists in the marine sedimentary layers of the Tertiary period. Since China has few Tertiary sedimentary layers, it shows that China's oil resources are also very few. At that time, this statement was almost "undoubted." Chinese geological magazines also listed China's oil reserves as eighth in the world. However, after liberation, according to the investigations based on Soviet theories, there is sufficient evidence to prove that China's oil reserves are very large. All the previous arguments had only one purpose - to allow imperialist countries to dump their oil products in China at high prices.

    In this semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, geologists were trapped in the high walls of research institutes. Their work was limited to paleontology research. Later, it was not easy to increase the number of people participating in this research. China's treasures continued to be plundered by imperialists or suffocated underground. Four years ago, the China Geological Work Planning Steering Committee received only two drilling rigs and the yet-to-be-revealed underground mysteries from the Kuomintang.

        New China Opens Up Broad Roads for Geological Work

    Four years is only a short moment in history, but in this moment, China's geological work has traveled more mileage than in any period in history. In the past year, the amount of work done by Team 429 of the Central Geological Department in the Daye Iron Mine area within 1,000 square kilometers in eight months far exceeded the total amount of geological work in the 60 years since the Daye Iron Mine was mined.

    In the spring of the first year of the Five-Year Plan, nearly 10,000 geological exploration troops under the leadership of the Central Geological Department have rushed to the front line of economic construction. The number of geological exploration teams of the Central Geological Department has increased from 29 in 1950 to more than 80, many of which are new resource exploration teams with geology, surveying, geophysical prospecting, trenching, and drilling. The era of two drilling rigs is gone forever. Now, the geological exploration teams of the Central Geological Department alone have nearly 200 Soviet-made and Chinese-made drilling rigs. Some geological exploration teams are equipped with field laboratories, experimental laboratories, repair factories specially serving drilling rigs, and various electrical equipment. In many mining areas, geological exploration teams have moved from sheds to newly built houses, trains and cars have transported various equipment from remote places, and electric lights have appeared for the first time in the nights of many mining areas. … All of this has never happened in Chinese history, and all of this makes geologists feel excited and inspired.

    A geologist from Team 641 of the Central Geological Department told me: "When we first arrived at the construction site, the villagers often came to see our gas lamps from twenty or thirty miles away. By last year, new things were added every day, drilling rigs were east and west, motors, diesel engines, and electric lights were on in the evening, and the villagers couldn't see enough. New cadres also arrived in batches. At this time, we truly realized that large-scale economic construction was really coming, and we also realized how heavy the word 'large' is."

    His name is Chen Yirui. In 1939, like many young people, he entered the Geology Department of Chongqing Central University with the dream of developing the underground treasures of the motherland. At that time, fifteen other young people were admitted at the same time as him. However, it wasn't long before they felt that studying geology at that time would not have any future, so they transferred to other departments. Chen Yirui and five other students who could not transfer completed the four-year course while complaining. Later, Chen Yirui was admitted to the Kuomintang's Central Geological Survey. His first trip to the field was to Guizhou to explore manganese mines. However, out of the four months of the business trip, only one week was arranged for the manganese mine. The Kuomintang officials regarded this exploration as a cash cow, compiled a budget, and demanded a sum of money, but the manganese mine was not investigated.

    If old China trapped geologists in the high walls of research institutes, then Chinese geologists seemed to have become accustomed to the small area within this high wall. New China requires geologists to break through this field and meet with minerals. Chen Yirui told me that they used to have a saying: "When you see igneous rocks, turn back." Chen Yirui said: "Because at that time we only studied strata and paleontology. There are no strata and no paleontology in igneous rocks, so there is nothing we are familiar with and want to study. When we see igneous rocks, everyone turns back and leaves. Now, the task the country gives us is to hand over minerals to the industrial sector, so we drill into the igneous rocks."

    Igneous rocks give geologists who are only familiar with strata and paleontology a lot of difficulties, but they expand their horizons and give them a place to constantly increase their knowledge and wisdom. When Chen Yirui first worked on non-ferrous metals in the Northeast, he couldn't even identify minerals, but after three months of exploration, he became familiar with various minerals. Surveying, which he didn't care about before, he has now learned. In the past, he calculated the amount of ore and went back, and never considered the hydrological situation for mining. Now he also knows that he needs to investigate the hydrogeological situation. Having learned many things he didn't understand, Chen Yirui and many geologists like Chen Yirui deeply feel the future that New China has brought to them. Because of this, although their tasks in 1953 exceeded those in 1952 by ten to twenty-three times, in addition to feeling the heavy responsibility, they also felt glory at the same time.

    Treat Big Mountains as Small Mounds, Treat the Sea as a Small Ditch

    In the geological exploration army of New China, there is a group of young geologists who were trained in the universities of New China. They are the new blood in geological work. In the autumn of 1952, the largest number of geology graduates in history were sent to various field teams. The determination of these people to dedicate themselves to the motherland is reflected in the two slogans that were popular among them at that time: Treat big mountains as small mounds, and treat the sea as a small ditch.

    Here, I will tell the story of Liu Xiangpei. Liu Xiangpei is a graduate of the Geology Department of Tsinghua University. In September 1952, he and some other students were sent to Team 429 of the Central Geological Department. Liu Xiangpei told me very frankly that the field life was indeed too unfamiliar to them. They lived in beautiful schools for a long time and were accustomed to walking on asphalt roads. Now they live in desolate mountains and valleys, have no water to drink often, and often only have sweet potatoes to fill their stomachs. Therefore, some people inevitably miss their families, schools, and city life. In short, at the beginning, many things were not used to, but the education of New China made them understand ideological struggle, and their enthusiasm for dedicating themselves to the motherland gradually buried the negative factors in their minds.

    Liu Xiangpei can't forget one thing. One night, after he had dinner, he walked to the house of an old lady nearby. He saw that the old lady was still sitting on a small stool and slowly shaking the spinning wheel. He once asked her: "Grandma, how much do you spin in a day?"

    "Four taels, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less!"

    "How much money do you earn for spinning a pound?"

    The answer was surprising to him. One pound of yarn only earns two thousand yuan. Liu Xiangpei felt very heavy in his heart. This old lady's labor is only worth five hundred yuan a day. What a poor handicraft industry! He remembered that someone had told him: a yarn factory with one hundred and sixty people can spin three thousand seven hundred catties of yarn a day, and one person is equivalent to twenty-three catties a day. That night, he lay in bed for a long time and could not fall asleep, repeatedly thinking about the relationship between industrialization and improving people's lives.

    On this year's National Day, Liu Xiangpei thought of many questions. He thought that at this time in previous years, the Tsinghua University team was passing in front of Tiananmen Square, and he was waving to Chairman Mao in his team, and jet planes were flying over Tiananmen Square… At this time, he felt how great the motherland was, how exciting the start of large-scale economic construction was, and he also felt that although Beijing was thousands of miles away, it didn't seem so far away, and the Party was also by his side, asking him to bring out minerals and hand them over to the industrial sector.

    On this day, he decided to commemorate the National Day by adhering to work for life. In the evening, he wrote a vow in his diary: "Today is National Day, I swear! I will devote all my energy to the long-term, arduous struggle with nature, until my heart beats for the last time."

    Soon, one day, the captain was sick and couldn't do some things, and the north wind was blowing. Everyone remembered that there was a mountain beside the road they were walking to the construction site. In the past, they always thought that there were only some altered rocks on the mountain, so they might as well take this time to go up the mountain to take a look. Liu Xiangpei took on this task. He climbed to the top of the mountain and finally found some broken ore in the rubble. The shape of this ore was similar to the magnetite they had found before, but this mountain was two kilometers away from the previously discovered ore body. He was very suspicious: why would similar magnetite appear on a mountain two kilometers away? He picked up a few pieces of ore and placed them on the compass. The compass needle trembled, proving that it was indeed magnetite. Everyone was very excited and immediately reported to the main team. The main team sent comrades of geophysical prospecting, and using geophysical prospecting methods proved that this might be a hidden large ore body.

    Many young geologists like Liu Xiangpei have been tempered in practical work, learned many things they did not learn in the classroom, and feel happy to have the opportunity to dedicate their labor to the industrial construction of the motherland. Liu Xiangpei said with a smile to me: "I am a person who likes to fantasize. Every evening, when we go home from the construction site and walk in the mountains, we see the sun setting, and the mountains and the sky are all red. How beautiful. I always think that soon, there will be many big chimneys here, with smoke rising in the valleys, and the mountains and the sky will be red."

    I think this is not a fantasy, this is the tomorrow of New China, and the people who explore the underground treasures of the motherland are fighting for tomorrow.

    勘探祖国地下宝藏的人们
    范荣康
    在祖国的大陆上，许多从来没有人走过的地方，现在常常出现一批批背着仪器的人群。这些人攀登高山悬崖，长年累月地住在荒山和草原上。这就是新中国的地质勘探队。他们背负着祖国人民的希望，奔走在千山万水中，寻求沉睡在地下亿万年的矿藏，他们要让无数新的工厂和矿山在自己走过的土地上建立起来。祖国人民把他们称呼为经济建设的前哨。
    被出卖和被蹂躏的宝藏
    人们都还记得，中国曾被形容成一个捧着金碗讨饭的乞丐，许多人为中国的地大物博却无助于人民的贫穷而困恼。那时候，也曾有许多人梦想着开发地下的宝藏，有些人甚至直接参加了地质工作。可是，在旧中国，地质工作是被扼杀的，国民党出卖了民族的宝藏，帝国主义把中国的矿产当做了自己的资源。
    在江西一家的锰矿区，零乱的矿坑躺在山野上，就好像在那里不久之前曾发生一次战争。日本帝国主义者曾是这里的主人，他们掠夺这里的锰矿，用皮鞭和长靴逼着农民们开采，所有的矿石都运到日本的八幡钢铁厂去。留下来的就是这一摊零乱的矿坑。
    曾关心过中国的矿产情况的人，决不会忘记中国曾被称为一个石油贫乏的国家。曾有许多人引“经”据“典”，说石油基本上只存在于第三纪的海相沉积层内，既然中国第三纪的沉积层少，就说明中国的石油资源也很少。那时候，这种说法几乎是“无可怀疑”的了，中国的地质杂志上也把中国石油储藏量列为世界第八位。可是，解放以后，根据苏联的理论所进行的调查，却有充分的根据证明中国的石油蕴藏量是很大的，过去的一切论断只有一个目的——好让帝国主义国家在中国高价倾销他们的石油产品。
    在这个半封建半殖民地的国家里，地质工作者被困锁在研究院的高墙里，他们所作的只限于古生物研究，到后来，连参加这种研究的人也不容易增加了。中国的宝藏继续被帝国主义掠夺着，或者是窒息于地下。四年前，中国地质工作计划指导委员会从国民党手里接收的只是两部钻机和尚未揭晓的地下之谜。
        新中国为地质工作开辟了广阔的道路
    四年，在历史上只是短促的一瞬间，就这一瞬间，中国地质工作却走过了比历史上任何时期更多的里程。中央地质部四二九队去年八个月中，在大冶铁矿区一千平方公里内所作的工作量，就大大超过大冶铁矿开采以来六十多年中地质工作的总量。
    在五年计划第一年的春天，只是在中央地质部领导下的，已有近万人的地质勘探大军奔赴经济建设前线。中央地质部的地质勘探队已由一九五零年的二十九个增长到八十几个，其中有许多是拥有地质、测量、物理探矿、槽探、钻探等的新型资源勘探队。两部钻机的时代已一去不返，现在，只是中央地质部的地质勘探队就拥有近两百部苏联的和中国自制的钻机。有的地质勘探队配备着野外化验室、试验室、专门为钻机服务的修理工厂和各种电动设备。在许多矿区，地质勘探队从棚帐搬进新建的房屋，火车和汽车从遥远的地方运来各种器材，在许多矿区的夜晚，第一次出现了电灯。……所有这一切都是中国历史上从来没有过的，所有这一切都使地质工作者感到兴奋、激动。
    中央地质部六四一队的一位地质工作者告诉我：“我们刚到工地的时候，老乡们常从二、三十里以外来看我们的汽灯，到了去年，每天总要添些新的东西，钻机房东一个、西一个，马达呵，柴油机呵，一到晚上，电灯都亮了，老乡们看也看不过来，新的干部也一批批地到了，这时候，我们真正意识到大规模经济建设是真的来了，也意识到这个‘大’字有多么重的分量。”
    他的名字叫谌义睿，一九三九年，他和许多年青人一样，抱着开发祖国地下宝藏的幻想，考进了重庆中央大学地质系。当时，和他同时被录取的还有十五个年青人。可是没有多久，他们感到在那时学地质是不会有什么前途的，纷纷转系，没有能得到转系的谌义睿和其他五个同学，发着牢骚读完了四年的课程。后来，谌义睿考进了国民党的中央地质调查所。他第一次出发到野外，是被派到贵州去勘探锰矿。可是，出差四个月，只有一个星期是安排在锰矿上的。国民党的官儿们把这次勘探当做摇钱树，编造了预算，索取了一笔款子，而锰矿却没有调查出来。
    如果说旧中国把地质工作者困锁在研究院的高墙里，那么，中国的地质工作者也似乎已习惯于这座高墙里的狭小领域了。新中国要求地质工作者突破这个领域，和矿产见面。谌义睿告诉我，从前他们曾有这样一句话：“看到火成岩，朝后转。”谌义睿说：“因为那时候我们只研究地层和古生物，火成岩里没有地层，没有古生物，也就没有我们熟悉的和要研究的东西，看到火成岩，大家都回过头走了。现在，国家给我们的任务是把矿产交给工业部门，我们就钻到火成岩里去了。”
    火成岩给只熟悉地层和古生物的地质工作者很多困难，但却扩大了他们的视野，给了他们不断增长自己的学识和智慧的场所。谌义睿最初在东北搞有色金属时，连矿物都没法鉴定，但经过三个月的摸索，他已熟悉了各种矿物。测量，从前是不管的，现在也学会了。过去计算了矿量就回去了，从来没有为开采考虑水文情况，现在也知道要调查水文地质情况了。许多不懂的事情学会了，谌义睿和许多像谌义睿一样的地质工作者很深刻地感到新中国给他们带来的前途。正因为这样，他们一九五三年的任务虽然超过一九五二年十倍至二十三倍，但是他们除了感到责任艰巨外，同时感到的却是光荣。
    大山当作小土堆，大海当作小河沟
    新中国的地质勘探大军里，有一批是在新中国的高等学校里被培养出来的青年地质工作者。他们是地质工作中的新的血液。一九五二年的秋天，历史上数目最多的一批地质系毕业生被派到各个野外队去。这些人献身祖国的决心表现在当时在他们中间流行的两句口号上：把大山当作小土堆，把大海当作小河沟。
    这里，我讲一讲刘湘培的故事。刘湘培是清华大学地质系的毕业生，一九五二年九月，他和其他一些同学被派到中央地质部四二九队。刘湘培很坦直地告诉我，野外的生活对于他们说来，确实太陌生了。他们长期生活在美丽的学校，习惯于柏油马路上的散步，现在他们住在荒山野谷中，要攀登高山悬崖，常常喝不上水，常常只有白薯充饥。于是，有些人不免怀念起家庭、学校和城市生活来。总之，刚开始的时候，许多事情是不习惯的，可是，新中国对他们的教导，使他们懂得了思想斗争，他们献身祖国的热情，逐渐湮没了思想中的消极因素。
    刘湘培忘不了一件事。那是在有一天夜晚，他吃过晚饭，走到邻近一个老大娘家里的时候，他看到老大娘还坐在小凳上慢慢地摇着纺车，他曾经问他：“大娘，一天纺多少？”
     “四两，有时多一点，有时少一点！”
    “纺一斤，挣多少钱呢？”
    回答是使他吃惊的，一斤纱只挣二千元。刘湘培心里很沉重了，这老大娘一天的劳动只值五百元。多么可怜的手工业呵！他想起曾经有人告诉他：一个一百六十人的纱厂一天能纺三千七百斤纱，一个人一天折合二十三斤。这一晚，他躺在床上长久没有睡着，反复想着工业化和改善人民生活的关系。
    这一年的国庆节，刘湘培想起许多问题，他想到往年这个时候，清华大学的队伍正从天安门前走过，他正在自己的队伍里向毛主席挥手致敬，喷气式飞机正掠过天安门的上空……这时，他感到祖国是多么伟大，大规模经济建设的开始是多么令人兴奋，他也感到北京虽然远在数千里以外，却好像并不怎样遥远，党也正在他的身旁，要他拿出矿来，交给工业部门。
    这一天，他决定了要以终生坚持工作来纪念国庆节，晚上，他在日记中写下一段誓词：“今天是国庆节，我宣誓！要把我的全部精力投入长期的，艰苦的，与大自然的斗争，直到心脏最后一次跳动为止”。
    不久，有一天，队长病了，有些事不能做，又刮着北风，大家想起在他们走向工地的路旁有一座山，过去总认为山上只有一些变色岩，不妨利用这个时间上山去看看。刘湘培担任了这个任务。他爬到山顶，终于在碎石堆里发现一些碎矿石，这种矿石的形状和他们以前发现的磁铁矿相似，但这座山距离以前发现的矿体有二公里远。他很怀疑：为什么在两公里以外的山上会出现相似的磁铁矿呢？他捡了几块矿石放在罗盘上，罗盘的指针颤动了，证明确是磁铁矿。大家兴奋得很，马上报告了总队，总队派来了物理探矿的同志，用物理探矿的方法证明了这可能是一个隐伏的大矿体。
    许多和刘湘培一样的青年地质工作者，都在实际工作中得到锻炼，学到许多在课堂里没有学到的东西，并且为了有机会把自己的劳动献给祖国的工业建设感到幸福。刘湘培笑着对我说：“我这人很喜欢幻想。每天黄昏的时候，我们从工地回家，走在山上，看到太阳下山了，山和天都给照得红红的，多么美丽。我总想着，不久以后，这里会出现许多大烟囱，在山谷里冒着烟，也把山和天都照得红红的。”
    我想，这倒不是幻想，这是新中国的明天，勘探祖国地下宝藏的人们正为明天而奋斗。
