Condolence Telegram from Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions
To the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions:

    We were shocked to learn of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Stalin, the great teacher of the working people of the world. With immense grief, we extend our condolences on behalf of the working class of Heilongjiang Province, China.

    In these sorrowful days, we will more firmly, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, unite the people of all strata, better learn from the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction, and closely unite with the Soviet people and all peace-loving people of the world, to fight to the end for the defense of world peace and the cause of communism.

    Eternal glory to Comrade Stalin, the great teacher of the working people of the world!
