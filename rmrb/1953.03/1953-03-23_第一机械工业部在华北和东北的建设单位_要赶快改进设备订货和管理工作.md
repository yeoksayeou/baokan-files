    The First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry's Construction Units in North and Northeast China
    Must Quickly Improve Equipment Ordering and Management
    [Report from this newspaper] The Central First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry recently inspected the material and technical supply work of its basic construction units in the North and Northeast regions and found that the blindness manifested by various units in ordering and the chaos in equipment management were very serious, wasting state funds and affecting the progress of national construction.
    Many basic construction units, fearing they would not be able to order equipment, prematurely and hastily submitted ordering requests without knowing what equipment they generally needed or the specifications and uses of the equipment, and often duplicated orders. For example, Northeast Machinery Factory No. 10 needed twelve grinders. Fearing that the equipment supply would fall short, they ordered them domestically and then also ordered them from abroad, resulting in the investment being tied up for more than two years. The representative of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau sent abroad to order equipment, without asking for instructions or reporting, arbitrarily ordered one hundred and twenty-six sets of civil engineering and construction equipment. The bureau was unaware of this situation and applied to order the same equipment domestically. The Pneumatic Tool Factory blindly ordered hair dryers from abroad without investigation and research. When they learned that they could be manufactured domestically, they requested a refund. It was also common to forget to order accessories. For example, when the Ball Bearing Factory ordered grinding machines, they omitted spare rubber grinding wheels; when Northeast Machinery Factory No. 5, No. 11, and Electric Power Factory No. 6 ordered boilers from abroad, some omitted return water pumps, and some omitted electric motors. As a result, the equipment could not be installed after it arrived and could not be put into production in a timely manner.
    Some units were very irresponsible in inspecting and storing equipment. Because there was no inspection, they did not know whether the equipment had arrived. For example, Northeast Machinery Factory No. 14 did not discover until the machine was being installed that seven boxes of the ordered gantry planer were in Qiqihar, two boxes were in Harbin, and the whereabouts of another box were unknown. The losses caused by neglecting equipment storage were appalling. Many units placed precision machines in the open air, exposed to wind and rain, causing the machines to rust, reducing their accuracy, and even losing parts. For example, during inspection, Northeast Machinery Factory No. 5 found that fifteen spiral milling machines had not been oiled for two years; the boxes containing precision lathes at Northeast Machinery Factory No. 7 were buried about a foot deep in the mud, and three of the four electrical equipment sets had rusted; the crane at Electric Power Factory No. 14 was deformed because it was not properly padded, the steel plates were desoldered, and the bearings had been pulled out.
    The bureaucratic style of work exhibited by some units in equipment management was very serious. The welding furnace imported by Northeast Machinery Factory No. 10 arrived in full in July of last year, but because of insufficient internal communication, it was not included in the third-quarter installation plan because it was mistakenly believed that it had not arrived. When Electric Power Factory No. 7 received a large number of equipment orders, they subjectively believed that the drawings had not arrived and could not be installed without opening the boxes, shelving all the arrived equipment and consequently reducing the installation plan; in fact, the drawings were in the boxes. The tool grinder at Electric Power Factory No. 5 had already been installed, but it was "reduced" in the plan because it was believed that it had not arrived. No one at Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory knew how many machines had arrived in the warehouse, and no one was specifically responsible for management. Northeast Machinery Factory No. 7 had only three people responsible for storing equipment, and they could not take care of everything. When a large number of machines arrived at the factory, the storekeepers asked the factory director for instructions on storage methods. The factory director said: "You figure out how to put them in the warehouse!" As a result, they stuffed all the machines, large and small, into three warehouses, so that they did not know which machine was in which warehouse during installation.
    Based on the results of the inspection, the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry summarized several methods for improving technical supply work:
        (1) Improve the organizational structure. The technical supply organization must form an organic system from the central competent department down to the construction units and their affiliated warehouses. In business, it is necessary to achieve unified and centralized leadership. In terms of staffing, it is necessary to equip strong cadres and a certain number of personnel with a certain level of technical expertise to be responsible for solving technical problems related to ordering. In the division of labor, it is necessary to be clear and specific, and implement a system of dedicated personnel with specific responsibilities. Special personnel should be responsible for mastering and processing all technical data, statistical reports, and ordering contracts to eliminate the phenomenon of unclear responsibilities and no one being responsible.
    (2) Strengthen the organization and planning of equipment ordering. Under the current circumstances, the submission of equipment orders should be based as much as possible on investment plans and technical design data. When submitting an order form, each unit must understand domestic and foreign production conditions, check the utilization and inventory of existing equipment, and formulate a technical supply plan in conjunction with the actual situation of past equipment orders and arrivals. Only in this way will it meet the actual requirements. The submission of order forms must also be reviewed level by level according to the time limit stipulated by the government and according to the leadership system. During the review, the design, finance, and basic construction departments should participate together. Once the ordering contract is signed, the enterprise unit should promptly prepare a financial plan for delivery and payment and formulate an installation plan based on the possible arrival date of the equipment.
        (3) Do a good job of preparing for receiving goods, which is one of the keys to ensuring the timely installation of equipment orders. When foreign equipment arrives, it is first necessary to conduct the necessary inspections and make records together with the import company, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and the foreign business representative. If it is considered qualified, it should be filled into the card according to the equipment catalog. The storage of machinery and equipment should be planned according to the order of the installation project; machinery and equipment entering the warehouse must be labeled according to a unified catalog and officially registered in the accounts. When installing, the problems of lifting and transportation must also be carefully considered. In addition, technical regulations for equipment management should also be formulated (including preparations for equipment handling and precautions), records of unpacking inspections, precision inspections, and test run inspections, storage rules for moisture-proof, rust-proof, fire-proof, ventilation, and lighting, and methods for preserving technical data. Only by doing all the preparatory work can the equipment be quickly put into production and unnecessary losses and waste can be avoided or reduced.

    第一机械工业部在华北和东北的建设单位
    要赶快改进设备订货和管理工作
    【本报讯】中央第一机械工业部最近检查了所属华北和东北地区的基本建设单位的物资技术供应工作，发现各单位在订货工作中所表现的盲目性和在设备管理工作中所表现的混乱现象十分严重，浪费了国家资金，也影响了国家建设的进度。
    很多基本建设单位唯恐订不到设备，在还不知道自己大体需要哪些设备以及设备的规格和用途时，就主观地、草率地提出订购项目，并常常发生重复提出订货的现象。例如东北机械十厂需要十二台磨床，因为怕设备供应落空，在国内订了，又向国外订，使设备投资积压了两年多。东北电工局派到国外订货的代表，既不请示，也不报告，便擅自订购了一百二十六台土木建筑设备。该局不了解这个情况，又在国内申请订购同样的设备。风动工具厂没有经过调查研究，便盲目地向国外订购吹风机，等到知道国内也能制造时，又要求退货。订货时忘记订购附件的现象也很多。像滚珠轴承厂订购砂轮机时，遗漏了备用的橡胶砂轮；东北机械五厂、十一厂和电工六厂向国外订购锅炉时，有的遗漏了回水泵，有的遗漏了电动机。结果，设备运到后，不能安装，不能及时投入生产。
    有些单位对设备的检验和保管很不负责任。由于没有检验，不知道设备是否到达了。如东北机械十四厂直到安装机器时，才发现订购的龙门刨有七箱在齐齐哈尔，两箱在哈尔滨，还有一箱不知下落。由于不重视设备的保管所造成的损失十分惊人。很多单位把精密机器放在露天，任凭风吹雨淋，以致机器生锈，精确度降低，甚至零件也散失不全。如东北机械五厂在检查时，发现有十五台螺旋铣床已有两年未擦油；东北机械七厂装精密车床的箱子已埋入泥土中一尺左右，四台电器设备已有三台生了锈；电工十四厂的吊车因为没有垫好而变形，钢板脱焊，轴承已经拔出。
    好些单位在设备管理工作中所表现的官僚主义作风是很严重的。东北机械十厂进口的熔接炉，去年七月份已全部到货，由于内部联系不够，在编制第三季度安装计划时，还以为没有到货而未编入计划。电工七厂接到大批设备订货时，不开箱检查就主观地认为图纸未到，不能安装，把全部已到设备搁置起来，并因此削减了安装计划；其实图纸就在箱内。电工五厂的工具磨床早已安装好了，但编制计划时以为尚未到货而“削减”了。太原重型机器厂没有人知道仓库里已到了多少台机器，也没有专人负责管理。东北机械七厂只有三个人负责保管设备，他们顾了东就顾不了西。大批机器到厂时，保管员向厂长请示保管办法，厂长说：“你们想办法装进仓库里去吧！”结果，他们就把大大小小的机器塞满了三个仓库，以致安装时不知哪台机器放在哪一个仓库里。
    第一机械工业部根据检查的结果，总结出改进技术供应工作的几点办法：
        （一）健全组织机构。技术供应的组织机构必须从中央主管部一直到建设单位及其所属仓库，成为一个有机性的系统。在业务上要实现统一的、集中的领导。在编制上要配备坚强的干部和一定数量的、具有一定技术水平的人员，负责解决订货中有关技术性的问题。在分工上要明确具体，实行专人专责制。凡技术资料、统计报表、订货合同等都要有专人负责掌握和处理，以消灭职责不清、无人负责的现象。
    （二）加强设备订货的组织性与计划性。设备订货的提出，在目前的情况下，应尽量根据投资计划和技术设计资料。每一个单位提出订货单时，必须了解国内外生产条件，查清现有设备的利用与库存情况，并结合着过去设备订货与到货的实际情况，制定技术供应计划。只有这样，才会符合实际的要求。订货单的提出，还必须按照政府所规定的期限，按照领导系统，逐级审查。在审查时，设计、财务、基本建设各有关部门应共同参加。订货合同一经签订，企业单位便应及时编制提货付款的财务计划，并根据设备可能到达日期，制定安装计划。
        （三）做好接货的准备工作，这是保证设备订货及时安装的关键之一。当国外设备运到后，首先要会同进口公司、商品检验局以及外国商务代表，进行必要的检查并制成纪录，如认为合格，便按照设备目录填入卡片。机器设备的保管，应根据安装工程顺序，有计划地存放；入库的机器设备，一定要按照统一目录加注标签，并正式登记入账。在安装时，对起重运输等问题也要周密考虑。此外，还应制定设备管理技术规程（包括设备搬运的准备工作及其注意事项），开箱检查、精密度检验及试车检验的纪录，防潮、防锈、防火、通风、照明等保管规则和技术资料的保存方法等。只有做好一切准备工作，才能使设备迅速投入生产，才能避免或减少不必要的损失和浪费。
