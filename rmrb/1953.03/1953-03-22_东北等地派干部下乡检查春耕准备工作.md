Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 21st: Party and government leading organs at all levels in Northeast China have organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to inspect the preparations for spring plowing and production. Yang Yichen, Secretary of the Liaoxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Shiying, Second Deputy Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Tao, Chairman of the Liaodong Provincial People's Government, and Li Youwen, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial People's Government, successively led large numbers of cadres to the countryside in late February and early March. In Liaodong, Jilin, and other three provinces alone, more than 1,000 cadres went to the countryside. At the same time, many cadres from counties and districts also went to the countryside.

This year, the general spring plowing preparations of farmers in Northeast China, such as sending manure and selecting seeds, have been better than in previous years; however, leading cadres in many counties do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of increasing agricultural production in the first year of large-scale national construction. Only about half of the 1,000 agricultural technology guidance stations in the region have been established; many new farm tools urgently needed for spring plowing have not yet been loaned to farmers; in particular, facing the widespread drought in the region, many counties have not mobilized farmers to effectively combat the drought, and the leadership work is still stuck in the stage of deployment and calls to action. This time, the cadres sent to the countryside by the provinces will concentrate their efforts on solving these problems.
Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, March 19th: Various places in Jiangxi Province are inspecting spring plowing preparations. At the end of January, the Shangrao Special Commissioner's Office organized five inspection teams to inspect the spring plowing production preparations in counties such as Fuliang, Qianshan, Yiyang, Shangrao, and Leping. Recently, the Pingxiang County organized an inspection team composed of more than 250 cadres to conduct "comprehensive inspections and key inspections" throughout the county, mobilizing all forces to serve the preparations for spring plowing and production. The Shangxi Township Branch of the Communist Party of China in Suichuan County first conducted political education among party members, and then led farmers to reverse the slackening thoughts and complacency, so that more than 3,000 mu of fields in the township basically achieved one plowing and two harrows, accumulating various fertilizers with an average application of 1,500 jin per mu, increasing and repairing 787 various farm tools, and the agricultural water conservancy projects built have been able to irrigate most of the fields. During the inspection in Fenglin Township, Fengcheng County, it was found that winter plowing and pest control were not thorough. The roots of rice were not removed or picked clean in all safflower grass fields and another 1,200 mu of fields. Farmers' fertilizer preparations were also insufficient. Xu Hongxi, a county agricultural labor model and one of the township's production banners, only prepared more than 150 dan of various fertilizers for more than 20 mu of fields; newly distributed farm households also generally lacked farm tools, cattle, and even seeds and rations. At present, the relevant leading organs in various places are leading farmers to step up preparations to welcome the spring plowing season, based on the problems found in the inspection.

    东北等地派干部下乡检查春耕准备工作 【新华社沈阳二十一日电】东北各级党、政领导机关组织大批干部下乡，检查春耕生产的准备工作。中共辽西省委员会书记杨易辰、中共黑龙江省委员会第二副书记张士英、辽东省人民政府主席李涛、吉林省人民政府主席栗又文等都相继在二月末三月初率领大批干部下乡，仅辽东、吉林等三省下乡的干部就有一千多名。同时，各县、区也有不少干部下乡。
    今年东北农民送粪、选种等一般春耕准备工作，比往年作的较好；但是，不少县的领导干部对国家进入大规模建设第一年，提高农业生产的重要性认识不足，全区一千个农业技术指导站才建立起半数左右；有许多春耕中急用的新农具还没有贷放到农民手中；特别是面临全区的春旱现象，许多县份都没有发动农民起来有效地抗旱，领导工作仍停留在布置、号召阶段。这次，各省下乡干部即将集中力量解决这些问题。 【新华社南昌十九日电】江西省各地正检查春耕准备工作。上饶专署一月底组织了五个检查组，分往浮梁、铅山、弋阳、上饶、乐平等县检查春耕生产准备工作。萍乡县最近由二百五十多个干部组成的检查大队，在全县范围内“全面巡视、重点检查”，动员一切力量为春耕生产准备工作服务。中共遂川县上溪乡支部首先在党员中进行了政治教育，然后领导农民扭转了松劲思想和自满情绪，使全乡三千多亩田基本上做到一犁两耙，攒积各种肥料平均每亩可施一千五百斤，增修各种农具七百八十七件，兴修的农田水利工程已能灌溉大部田地。丰城县枫林乡检查中发现冬耕除虫不彻底，全部红花草田和另外的一千二百多亩田内没有拔除或拣光稻根；农民的肥料准备也不充足，该乡的生产旗帜之一——县农业劳动模范徐洪喜，有二十多亩田只准备了各种肥料一百五十多担；新分得田的农户，也普遍地缺乏农具、耕牛，甚至还缺种籽和口粮。现各地有关领导机关正根据检查中发现的问题，领导农民加紧准备，迎接春耕季节的到来。
