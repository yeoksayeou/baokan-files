    Why is Shen County People's Court Delaying Sun Daxing's Divorce?
    Sun Yaming from Jixian Normal School, Hebei Province, writes: The issue of Zhang Xiaofu from Datun Village, Fifth District, Shen County, Hebei Province, and his wife Sun Daxing's divorce was previously adjudicated by the District People's Government. The woman disagreed and appealed to the Shen County People's Court in August of the old lunar calendar year, but it has not been processed to this day. During this period, the District People's Government forcibly told the woman to go to her husband's house to "clear out her belongings"; the village chief of Datun Village also "declared": "If you don't come to take your things, we will throw them to the Village People's Government!" Now, Sun Daxing is very ill because the divorce issue has not been properly handled. This delay has created a very bad influence among the masses. I suggest that the Shen County People's Court quickly handle their problem and investigate the reasons for the delay.
    Reply from the Office of the Shen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    A letter from the Office of the Shen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hebei Province: We have learned about the divorce issue between Zhang Xiaofu and his wife Sun Daxing from Datun Village, Fifth District of our county. After Sun Daxing appealed to the County People's Court because she disagreed with the District People's Government's ruling, it could not be resolved in a timely manner because the defendant, Zhang Xiaofu, was in Beijing. Recently, after Zhang Xiaofu returned, the County People's Court re-rendered a judgment: legally ruling that Zhang Xiaofu and Sun Daxing are divorced, and the man will subsidize the woman's living expenses and medical expenses with 700 jin of millet. The village chief's attitude towards Sun Daxing was wrong, and we have criticized him. It is not true that Sun Daxing is "very ill."

### 深县人民法院对孙大杏离婚问题为何拖延

专栏：读者来信摘要

    深县人民法院对孙大杏离婚问题为何拖延
    河北省冀县师范学校孙亚明来信：河北省深县第五区大屯村张小福和他妻子孙大杏离婚的问题，区人民政府曾经作了判决。女方不服，于去年旧历八月里上诉深县人民法院，直到现在没有处理。这期间，区人民政府又硬叫女方去婆家“清理自己的东西”；大屯村村长也“声明”：“如不来拉东西，给她扔到村人民政府去！”现在，孙大杏因离婚问题没得到应有的处理，气得病很重。这样拖下去，在群众中也造成很不好的影响。我建议深县人民法院迅速处理他们的问题，并检查拖延的原因。
    中共深县委员会办公室的答复
    中共河北省深县委员会办公室来信：关于我县第五区大屯村张小福和他妻子孙大杏离婚的问题，我们已经了解过。当孙大杏不服区人民政府的判决上诉县人民法院后，因为被告张小福在北京，所以没有能及时解决。最近张小福回来后，县人民法院已经重新作了判决：依法判决张小福和孙大杏离婚，由男方补助女方生活费和医药费小米七百斤。该村村长对孙大杏的态度是错误的，我们已经批评了他。说孙大杏“气得病很重”，不是事实。
