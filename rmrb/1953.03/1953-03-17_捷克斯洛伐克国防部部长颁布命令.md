Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 15th, TASS dispatch: The Minister of National Defense of the Czechoslovak Republic issued the following order: Comrades soldiers, non-commissioned officers, and junior officers! Comrades field officers and generals! In these sorrowful days, after the greatest figure of our time, the genius leader and teacher of the Soviet people and all progressive humanity, and the best friend of our people, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, departed from us, our people and our army have suffered another heavy grief. Our beloved and respected President of the Republic, Commander-in-Chief of the Czechoslovak Armed Forces, and Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Comrade Klement Gottwald, passed away at 11:00 a.m. on March 14, 1953.

Comrade Gottwald's work was great. Throughout his life, he followed the invincible doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and waged an irreconcilable struggle for the rights of the working people. He founded and nurtured the Czechoslovak Communist Party, uniting all working people under the leadership of the Party to fight against capitalist exploitation and leading them in the struggle against the fascist occupiers. After the Soviet Army liberated our motherland, he led the people of all nationalities in our country to step through the door of socialist construction. Comrade Klement Gottwald was the creator of our armed forces—the people's army of our country. He tirelessly cared about the defense capabilities of the Republic, the high combat effectiveness, political level, and moral standards of our armed forces.

Comrades soldiers, non-commissioned officers, and junior officers! Comrades field officers and generals! We must unite more closely around the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government of the National Front! Before the remains of our dear teacher, our father, and our Commander-in-Chief, President Klement Gottwald, we swear: We will tirelessly strengthen the power of our armed forces and improve its combat readiness and vigilance. We will carry out the teachings of Comrade Klement Gottwald: shoulder to shoulder with the glorious Soviet Army, we will more vigilantly defend world peace. We will eliminate all aggressors who threaten the socialist construction of our motherland.

                        Minister of National Defense, Army General
                                      A. Chepichka
