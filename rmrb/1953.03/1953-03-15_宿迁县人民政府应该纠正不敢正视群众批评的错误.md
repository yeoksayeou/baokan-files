    Suqian County People's Government Should Correct the Mistake of Not Daring to Face Mass Criticism

    Su Jian writes: The letter from reader Su Ren published in the People's Daily on January 21st, criticizing the Suqian County Agricultural and Forestry Section for violating financial discipline, is completely factual. The County People's Supervisory Committee had decided to issue a circular criticizing this matter to educate all county cadres. However, Secretary Ye (the letter did not specify the name) of the County People's Government, after reading the draft of the circular, said: "Let the Agricultural and Forestry Section conduct a self-criticism at the government affairs meeting, and there is no need to issue a circular." However, to this day, the person in charge of the Agricultural and Forestry Section has not conducted a self-criticism at the government affairs meeting, and the circular has been quietly suppressed. I believe that Secretary Ye's approach shows that he has not been able to grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism very well, weakening the educational role of criticism, and should be examined and corrected.

### 宿迁县人民政府应该纠正不敢正视群众批评的错误

专栏：读者来信摘要

    宿迁县人民政府应该纠正不敢正视群众批评的错误
    苏建来信：一月二十一日人民日报发表的读者苏人批评宿迁县农林科违犯财政纪律的来信，内容完全属实。县人民监察委员会曾决定发通报批评这件事，来教育全县干部。但县人民政府叶秘书（来信未写明名字）看完通报稿后，却说：“让农林科在政务会议上检讨一下就算了，不必发通报了。”但至今农林科负责人并未在政务会议上作检讨，而通报也就不声不响地被压下了。我认为叶秘书这种做法说明他对批评和自我批评的武器还不能很好的掌握，削弱了批评的教育作用，应该检查纠正。
