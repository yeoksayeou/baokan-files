Strengthen the Patriotic Health Campaign to Smash the American Bacteriological Warfare
Vice Mayor of Qingdao Municipality
National Model Worker of Hygiene (Second Class), Zhang Gongzhi

From the confessions of captured American air force officers H. W. Balster and Quinnie J Breedlove, we can see that the American aggressors not only used the lives of the Chinese and Korean people as a criminal experiment for bacteriological warfare but had also already begun the stage of so-called "regular warfare."

The American imperialists are attempting to use bacteriological warfare to salvage their defeat on the Korean battlefield, but the facts of the past year or more have fully proven that this shameless delusion will never be realized. Due to the extensive development of the anti-bacteriological warfare struggle by the Chinese and Korean people, not only were the poisonous insects and substances spread by the enemy quickly exterminated, but also various media spreading germs were eliminated on a large scale, environmental sanitation was improved, hygiene knowledge was popularized, the level of health was raised, and the strength for the struggle against the enemy was strengthened. Taking Qingdao City as an example, Qingdao is an area that the enemy has sprinkled with bacteria several times. Under the call and leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, all the people in the city, without exception, actively participated in the anti-bacteriological warfare struggle. The masses automatically put forward: "Wherever poisonous insects are sprinkled, we will eliminate them there!" "One fly, one American soldier; the enemy can spread them, we will resolutely wipe them out!" Cleaning up garbage, filling in sewage ditches, eliminating mosquitoes and flies, and blocking rat holes have become the conscious actions of the broad masses, thereby fundamentally improving the sanitary conditions of Qingdao City. According to statistics from March to September of last year, a total of seven months, the city cleared more than 90,000 tons of garbage, filled more than 12,000 depressions and sewage pits, dredged more than 200,000 meters of ditches, blocked more than 2 million rat holes, and caught more than 360,000 rats and more than 3.3 billion flies. The people of Qingdao City used these achievements to effectively combat the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism.

In order to consolidate and expand these achievements and thoroughly smash the American bacteriological warfare, the people of Qingdao City are currently carrying out a spring patriotic health shock movement. Around the Spring Festival, a mass anti-bacteriological warfare propaganda campaign was widely launched throughout the city. From children of seven or eight years old to old ladies of seventy or eighty years old, all automatically participated in costumed propaganda, singing self-composed anti-bacteriological warfare ballads, and performing living newspaper plays exposing the crimes of American bacteriological warfare, fully expressing the Chinese people's hatred for the US government's heinous crimes of bacteriological warfare and their firm confidence in smashing it. During the movement, the broad masses enthusiastically launched challenge and response competitions, creating many new methods for eliminating "blank" areas and clearing breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. More than 600 people in the Shibei District formed a Yangko team, with gongs and drums in front for costumed propaganda, followed by a broom team, a shovel team, a basket-carrying team, and a garbage truck; wherever it was not clean, they took action there. Young people and women automatically organized "shock teams" and "scissor battalions," rushing wherever it was dirty and "cutting" into wherever there were "blanks." The Sifang District organized a digging team of more than 1,200 people, digging out 848,000 fly pupae in just five days and creating and popularizing new experience in digging pupae. This shock movement is in full swing, and the masses reflect: "Bacteriological warfare is not scary, organize to defeat it." This is the resounding answer of the Chinese people to the American bacteriological war criminals. This is not just a sentence, but the actual actions of thousands upon thousands of Chinese people. I am an old man of seventy-eight years old, weak and sickly, and I stand in the ranks of the struggle just like them, resolutely fighting to the end, until the enemy is willing to stop. I have also personally seen old people like me and young people, women and children, standing up heroically to fight the American imperialists who create plague. I firmly believe that with the leadership of Chairman Mao and the persistent struggle of the broad masses, we have full confidence and sufficient strength to smash the enemy's bacteriological warfare and achieve a complete victory.

    加强爱国卫生运动粉碎美国细菌战
    青岛市人民政府副市长
    全国乙等卫生模范  张公制
    从被俘美国空军军官许威布尔和布莱的供词中，
    我们看到美国侵略者不仅以中朝人民生命作为细菌战的罪恶试验，而且早已开始了所谓“正规作战”的阶段了。
    美帝国主义者是企图用细菌战来挽救它在朝鲜战场上的失败的，但是过去一年多以来的事实，已充分证明这种无耻妄想是永远不能实现的。由于中朝人民反细菌战斗争广泛开展，不但迅速扑灭了敌人撒布的毒虫毒物，而且大规模地消灭了各种传播病菌的媒介，改善了环境卫生，普及了卫生常识，提高了健康水平，加强了对敌斗争的力量。以青岛市为例，青岛是敌人几次撒布过细菌的地区，全市人民在共产党和人民政府的号召与领导下，家家户户，男女老少无一例外地积极投入了反细菌战斗争。群众自动提出：“毒虫撒布到那里，就把它消灭在那里！”“一只苍蝇，一个美国兵；敌人能撒下，我们坚决打干净！”清除垃圾，填平污水沟，消灭蚊蝇，堵塞鼠洞，已成为广大群众的自觉行动，从而根本改善了青岛市的卫生状况。据去年三月至九月共七个月的统计，全市清除垃圾九万余吨，填平了洼地、污水坑一万二千余处，疏通沟渠二十万余公尺，堵塞鼠洞二百余万个，捕鼠三十六万余只，捕打苍蝇三十三亿余只。青岛市人民就以这些成绩有力地打击了美帝国主义的细菌战。
    为了巩固和扩大这些成绩，彻底粉碎美国细菌战，青岛市人民目前正在开展春季爱国卫生突击运动。春节前后，全市广泛地展开了群众性的反细菌战宣传。从七、八岁的儿童到七八十岁的老大娘，都自动地参加化妆宣传，唱着自编的反细菌战快板，表演着揭发美国细菌战罪行的活报，充分表示出我国人民对于美国政府细菌战滔天罪行的愤恨和粉碎它的坚强信心。在运动中，广大群众热烈地发起了挑战应战竞赛，创造了许多消灭“空白”地区和清除病媒昆虫繁殖场所的新办法。市北区六百多人组成秧歌队，前面打着锣鼓进行化妆宣传，后面跟着扫帚队、铁锨队、抬筐队和垃圾车，那里不干净，就在那里动手。青年和妇女自动地组织了“突击队”、“剪刀营”，那里脏就突击那里，那里有“空白”就“剪”进去。四方区组织了一千二百多人的挖蛹队，仅五天以内挖掘了八十四万八千余个蝇蛹，并创造推广了新的挖蛹经验。这个突击运动正在热烈进行中，群众反映：“细菌战不可怕，组织起来打败它。”这就是中国人民对美国细菌战犯的响亮回答，这不是一句话，是千千万万中国人民的实际行动。我是一个七十八岁的老人了，身弱多病，也和他们一样地站在斗争的行列，坚决斗争到底，一直打到敌人愿意罢手的时候为止。我也亲眼看到像我这样的老年人和青年人，妇女和儿童，都英勇地站立起来，和制造瘟疫的美帝国主义者作斗争。我坚信：有毛主席的领导，有广大群众的坚持斗争，我们就有充分的信心和足够的力量粉碎敌人细菌战，取得彻底胜利。
