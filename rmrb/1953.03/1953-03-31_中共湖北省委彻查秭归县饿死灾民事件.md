The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Thoroughly Investigates the Incident of Starved Disaster Victims in Zigui County

    Liu Jinbo, Deputy District Chief of Yanglinqiao District in Zigui County, Hubei Province, led a corrupt and degenerate life, disregarded the suffering of the people, and during the unprecedented famine in the spring of 1951, he was derelict in his duties, failing to lead disaster victims in production to overcome the famine, failing to diligently distribute relief grain and funds, and failing to provide assistance to those dying, resulting in the deaths of 166 disaster victims due to starvation and disease.

    Zigui County is a large mountainous area in western Hubei Province with infertile land. Coupled with the long-term and cruel exploitation by the Kuomintang bandits, the masses lived in extreme poverty and had a very weak ability to resist disasters. In the spring of 1950, Yanglinqiao District in the county experienced excessive rainfall, as well as early frost and early snow, which fatally damaged the crops in the high mountains. Good land yielded only 30% of the normal harvest, while poor land yielded only 10% to 20%. From August of that year, people began to eat Guanyin clay. By the spring of 1951, the masses were generally eating wild grass to survive. In the winter of 1950, the Yichang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed all counties that disaster areas should focus on disaster relief and leading production, combined with the rent reduction and anti-hegemony movement. However, the Zigui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Zigui County People's Government did not implement the instructions of their superiors, failed to go deep into the lower levels to understand the disaster situation, and mistakenly placed the central work on the anti-hegemony and rent reduction movements. For a severely affected area like Yanglinqiao District, the county party and government leading organs not only lacked specific and in-depth leadership, but also sent Liu Jinbo, a person with bad character and no concern for the lives and deaths of the masses, to serve as the deputy district chief (the district at that time had no Chinese Communist Party District Committee Secretary or District Chief, and Liu Jinbo alone controlled the entire district). Liu Jinbo had a serious bureaucratic work style and led a corrupt and degenerate life. In 1950, when he worked in the Cangdong Sub-district, he embezzled 239 jin of grain coupons from the village and bought five piglets and eight sheep. When he was transferred to Yanglinqiao District as deputy district chief in January 1951, just as the spring famine was severe, he did not actively lead the masses in production to overcome the famine. Instead, he raised seven pigs himself and used deceptive methods to "take back" six shi of land from tenant farmers, having the farmers cultivate it for him. While the disaster victims were eating Guanyin clay and wild grass, he often ate preserved meat and chicken eggs. He did not go deep among the masses to understand the disaster situation, nor did he try to lead and organize the masses to produce and overcome the famine, but let it develop naturally. Even when disaster victims made requests to him, he ignored them. For example, in Santai Township, three children from Liu Zongjin's family starved to death, and a farmer in Xiangguo Township starved to death. When someone reported this to Liu Jinbo at the district level and requested government relief, he remained unmoved and pushed the responsibility to the villages, and did not report to the county. The Zigui County People's Government issued 15,000 jin of loan grain and 63,000 jin of relief grain to the district, and allocated more than 230 million yuan to purchase timber in the district to support the disaster victims' self-reliance through production. If this grain and funds could have been used effectively, it could have solved the difficulties of some of the disaster victims. However, Liu Jinbo, fearing trouble, distributed the loan grain and relief grain equally. He also failed to properly manage the timber purchase work, resulting in middle peasants with stronger disaster resistance getting more, and poor peasants getting less. At that time, some townships in the district still had the fruits of struggle from the suppression of bandits, anti-hegemony, and rent reduction and deposit refunds. In the four townships of Santai, Longfeng, Banqiao, and Longjing alone, there were 7,492 jin of grain accumulated, as well as gold, silver, furniture, and cattle. However, the district did not promptly instruct the townships to quickly distribute this batch of grain to the disaster victims. As a result, some townships had people starving to death, while the grain stored by the farmers' associations had already rotted. When Liu Jinbo inspected work in Banqiao Township, he even ate and drank heavily with Cai Guofa, the chairman of the farmers' association, wasting the rice from the masses' fruits of struggle. When the deputy township chief of the township reported to him: "People below have nothing to eat, people are starving to death, and the farmers' association has 3,000 jin of fruit grain rice stored and not distributed," he also ignored it. What was particularly abhorrent was that Liu Jinbo had no class sympathy at all, treated the hungry and cold disaster victims as "lazybones" and "thieves," and brutally implemented suppression. He promoted the "experience" of Zhang Jinlin, a district cadre in the district, who held "lazybone" meetings and criticized and struggled against "lazybones" in Banqiao Township, and said at a mass meeting in Banqiao Sub-district: "Lazybones and idlers do not produce, and no one is responsible if they starve to death." This encouraged some district and township cadres to violate laws and regulations and illegally tie up and beat disaster victims. Lin Zhaoxiang, the militia captain of Banqiao Township, regarded disaster victims as "thieves" and beat more than 20 people, injuring four and beating three to death. Liu Jinbo neither promptly stopped and handled such serious illegal events, nor did he report them to his superiors.

    Under the influence of Liu Jinbo's bad ideological style, most of the district cadres in the district also did not care about the lives and deaths of the masses and had serious coercive orders and illegal and undisciplined behaviors. Zhang Jinlin (female), a district cadre in the district, ate and drank heavily with the chairman of the farmers' association, using the masses' fruits of struggle, while working in Banqiao Township. When disaster victims sought her to find a solution, she scolded the disaster victims as "lazybones" and held "lazybone" meetings, hanging red and black stripes on the disaster victims as a symbol of "lazybones." She did not go down to the groups on weekdays, nor did she understand the situation, and as a result, 32 people starved to death in the township, while the farmers' association still had 3,000 jin of fruit grain accumulated. Wu Xuepin, the production assistant of the district, in addition to also failing to handle the fruits of struggle in a timely manner and distributing loan grain and relief grain equally, when disaster victims asked him for a way to overcome the famine, he said: "I am not a grain company, you deserve to starve to death. Who told you not to produce well!" He knew that four people had starved to death in the township, but fearing punishment, he did not report to his superiors. He also regarded disaster victims as "thieves" and illegally detained five disaster victims. Under the influence of Wu Xuepin, village cadres constantly tied up and beat disaster victims. In addition, district cadres Wang Huantang and Liu Xu also had similar illegal and undisciplined behaviors.

    When deaths continued to occur in the district, Liu Jinbo did not report to his superiors in a timely manner, and when he reported to the Zigui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in May of that year, he lied and said that the district "had more than 200 people die of swelling disease," counting all the people who starved to death among them, deliberately shirking responsibility. The Zigui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, trusting Liu Jinbo's false report, did not pay attention to the serious fact that more than 200 people had died. It was not until the spring of 1952, when the Propaganda Minister of the Zigui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party led land reform in Yanglinqiao District, that this serious incident was discovered, and the County Committee reported it to the Yichang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. At that time, the Yichang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent an inspection team to the site for inspection, but because they did not fully understand the seriousness of the incident, the situation was not clarified, and it was left to be resolved in the "Three Antis" movement, delaying the problem, and it was not reported to the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. It was not until September of last year that the Yichang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a preliminary decision and reported it to the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In this preliminary decision, only Liu Jinbo, the main culprit who directly caused the starvation deaths, was expelled from the party and sentenced by the judicial organs to one year in prison, which was suspended and he was placed under supervision in the organ. The Zigui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which had committed serious bureaucracy, was decided to be exempted from punishment. Such a disposition was obviously not serious. After receiving the report on this incident, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was delayed for more than four months by individual comrades in the General Office and the Discipline Inspection Committee, and the Provincial Committee did not strictly supervise it. On February 24, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party reported the situation of the starvation death incident in Zigui County in the spring of 1951 to the Central China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and issued a notice on the starvation death incident in Zigui County in the spring of 1951, stipulating that local committees and county committees organize cadres to study the documents related to this incident, and in conjunction with checking bureaucracy, lack of organization and discipline, and certain behaviors of concealing and deceiving the party, violating laws and regulations, etc. in their respective organizations. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has now sent people to Zigui County for a thorough investigation; after clarifying the responsibilities of the Yichang Prefectural Committee and the Zigui County Committee and the overall situation, the final disposition will be decided.

    中共湖北省委彻查秭归县饿死灾民事件
    湖北省秭归县杨林桥区副区长刘金波生活腐化堕落，漠视人民疾苦，在一九五一年春该区发生多年未有的灾荒期间，违法失职，不领导灾民生产渡荒，不认真发放救济粮款，见死不救，因而先后有一百六十六个灾民因饿病而致死。
    秭归县是湖北省西部的大山区，土地贫瘠，加上国民党匪帮长期的残酷剥削，群众生活非常困苦，抗灾能力十分薄弱。一九五○年春，该县杨林桥区降雨过多，又遭到早霜、早雪等灾害，高山上的庄稼受到致命的摧残，好地仅收三成，薄地则只有一、二成。从那年的八月起，便有人吃观音土。到了一九五一年春天，群众又普遍吃野草度日。一九五○年冬，中共宜昌地委曾经指示各县：灾区应以救灾、领导生产为中心，结合进行减租反霸运动。但中共秭归县委和秭归县人民政府不执行上级的指示，不深入下层了解灾荒情况，错误地把中心工作放在反霸和减租运动上。对杨林桥区这样的重灾区，该县党政领导机关不仅缺乏具体深入的领导，而且派了一个品质恶劣、不关心群众死活的刘金波去当副区长（该区当时没有中共区委书记，也没有区长，仅由刘金波一人掌握全区）。刘金波有严重的官僚主义作风，而且生活腐化堕落。一九五○年他在仓东小区工作时，贪污村中粮票二百三十九斤，买猪子五口，羊八只。一九五一年一月他被调到杨林桥区任副区长时，正值春荒严重，他不积极领导群众生产渡荒，反而自己喂猪七口，并用欺骗方法“收回”佃农的六石田，让农民替他代耕。在灾民吃观音土和野草的时候，他却经常吃腊肉和鸡子。他不深入群众了解灾情，也没有设法领导和组织群众生产渡荒，而是任其自然发展。甚至在灾民向他提出请求时，他仍置之不理。例如三台乡刘宗金家饿死了三个小孩，香果乡饿死了一个农民，有人到区向刘金波报告，请求政府救济，他竟无动于中地向村里推，并且不向县上报告。秭归县人民政府发给该区贷粮一万五千斤、救济粮六万三千斤，并拿出二亿三千多万元，在该区收购木料，以支持灾民生产自救。这笔粮款如能有效使用，也可以解决部分灾民的困难。可是刘金波怕麻烦，把贷粮和救济粮平均发放了。对于收购木料的工作，也未很好掌握，结果是抗灾能力较强的中农得的多，贫农得的少。当时该区部分乡还存有清匪、反霸和减租退押时的斗争果实，其中仅三台、龙风、板桥和龙井四个乡就积压着粮食七千四百九十二斤，还有金银、家具和耕牛等物，但区里并未及时指示各乡把这批粮食迅速分发给灾民。结果有些乡饿死了人，而农会存的粮食却已霉烂。刘金波到板桥乡检查工作时，还和农会主席蔡国发大吃大喝，浪费群众的斗争果实中的大米。该乡副乡长向他反映：“下面没吃的，饿死了人，农会存着果实粮大米三千斤不发”他也置之不理。特别可恶的，是刘金波竟毫无阶级同情心，把饥寒交迫的灾民当作“懒汉”、“小偷”，粗暴地实行打击。他曾经把该区区干部张晋林在板桥乡召开“懒汉”会、批评斗争“懒汉”的“经验”加以推广，并在板桥小区群众大会上说：“懒汉二流子不生产，饿死了没人负责。”这就助长了某些区乡干部违法乱纪，捆吊灾民。板桥乡民兵队长林兆祥视灾民为“小偷”，曾吊打群众二十多人，打伤四人，打死三人。刘金波对于这样严重的违法事件，既不及时制止和处理，也不向上级报告。
        在刘金波的恶劣思想作风影响之下，该区多数区干部也同样不关心群众的死活，并有严重的强迫命令和违法乱纪行为。该区区干部张晋林（女）在板桥乡工作时，用群众的斗争果实，和农会主席大吃大喝。灾民找她想办法，她反骂灾民是“懒汉”，并召开“懒汉”会，给灾民挂上作为“懒汉”标志的红黑条。她平日不下组，不去了解情况，结果该乡饿死了三十二个人，而农会却还积压着斗争果实粮三千斤。该区生产助理员吴学品，除同样不及时处理斗争果实、并平均发放贷粮和救济粮外，当灾民问他渡荒办法时，他说：“我又不是粮食公司，你们饿死活该。谁叫你们不好好生产的！”他知道乡里饿死了四个人，怕受处分，也不向上报告。他也视灾民为“小偷”，曾经非法扣押五个灾民。乡村干部在吴学品的影响下，不断吊打灾民。此外，区干部王焕堂、刘旭等都有类似的违法乱纪行为。
    在该区不断发生死亡事件时，刘金波没有及时向上级报告，而在是年五月向中共秭归县委会报告时，又欺骗说该区“害肿病死了二百余人”，把饿死的人都算在其中，有意推卸责任。中共秭归县委会轻信刘金波的假报告，对死亡二百多人的严重事实未予重视。直到一九五二年春，中共秭归县委会宣传部长到杨林桥区领导土地改革时，才发现这一严重事件，由县委报告了中共宜昌地委。当时中共宜昌地委曾派检查组到现场检查，但因对这一事件的严重性认识不足，情况未弄清，就留待“三反”中去解决，把问题拖下来，也未向中共湖北省委报告。直到去年九月，中共宜昌地委才作出初步决定，报告了中共湖北省委。在这个初步决定中，仅将直接造成饿死人事件的主要罪犯刘金波开除党籍，交司法机关判一年徒刑，还是缓期执行，留机关管制。对犯有严重官僚主义的中共秭归县委会，竟决定免予处分。这样的处理显然是不严肃的。中共湖北省委接到这一事件的报告后，又被办公厅及纪律检查委员会个别同志积压四个多月，省委也未严加督促。二月二十四日中共湖北省委已向中共中央中南局报告了这一事件的情况，并发布了关于一九五一年春秭归县饿死人事件的通知，规定各地委、县委组织干部学习有关这一事件的文件，结合检查各该组织中官僚主义、无组织无纪律和某些对党隐瞒欺骗、违法乱纪等行为。现中共湖北省委已派人到秭归县作彻底调查；待查清中共宜昌地委、秭归县委的责任和全面情况后，再决定最后处理办法。
