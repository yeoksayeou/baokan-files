The barbarity of the American aggressors is rare in the world, and their stupidity and shamelessness are also rare in the world. When their unspeakable sins are publicly exposed before the righteous people of the world, the American aggressors behave even more stupidly than the ridiculed ostrich.

Jerome, commander of the First Marine Air Wing of the U.S. Navy, once convened a meeting to discuss the "secrecy" of American germ warfare. At that time, according to the confession of captured American officer Webb, "One officer pointed out that the Chinese had already claimed that the United States was using germ warfare, and since B-29 aircraft had previously carried out germ warfare, many pilots had become prisoners of war. Therefore, the enemy (referring to our side – editor's note) must already know that germ warfare is being used." Webb continued, "We all recognize this truth, but as the general (Jerome) pointed out, if the government decides to deny its use, then we soldiers have no choice but to try our best to maintain this fabricated story." The American aggressors' behavior, even more stupid than an ostrich, lies in their desire to "try their best to maintain this fabricated story." When an ostrich buries its head in the sand, it thinks it is absolutely safe, but the American aggressors know that it is not safe and still want to "try their best to maintain this fabricated story," which is even more stupid than an ostrich.

Now, Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in Korea, is again putting on a stupid pose like an ostrich. After hearing the confessions of captured American officers Webb and Bley about the crimes of the United States in conducting germ warfare in Korea, and with the U.S. government in a state of extreme panic, Clark reluctantly issued a statement on February 24th, once again "trying his best to maintain the fabricated story." In the consistently shameless tone of the American aggressors, Clark stupidly declared that the U.S. military "has not engaged in germ warfare or any other form of warfare that could be mistaken for germ warfare in Korea or anywhere else." Such a cliché is the only content of Clark's statement. Besides this, Clark could not come up with any other magic weapon. He very reluctantly stated that it "is very doubtful whether what those unfortunate prisoners of war said" in Webb's and Bley's confessions "is true"; he babbled that these confessions were "fabricated" using "nerve-wracking methods." However, everyone can see that this is still the American aggressors' consistent "fabricated story."

People all over the world have heard the voices of Webb and Bley. Their voices were so clear, definite, and powerfully emanating from their conscience. The facts they confessed about the American germ warfare crimes were so precise, concise, and included many specific details. The people who uttered such voices were none other than the captured colonel chief of staff and major ordnance officer of the First Marine Air Wing of the U.S. Navy. It is the words of these two captured American officers, familiar with the ugly inside story of American germ warfare crimes, that have long pierced the "fabricated story" that Clark and his ilk are trying to maintain. If Clark's statement is not fabricated nonsense, then why doesn't it dare to refute the facts confessed by Webb and Bley in the slightest? And why doesn't any of the other officials and generals of the American aggression group dare to come out and make the slightest refutation? It is clear that the facts of American germ warfare confessed by Webb and Bley are irrefutable. On any point, I ask, does Clark and his ilk dare to refute it?

For example, Webb said that the overall plan for germ warfare in Korea was instructed by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1951. And this instruction was sent by a special person to General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, and was conveyed to Wyland, Commander of the U.S. Far East Air Force, who personally convened a meeting to arrange it. Ridgway, who once categorically denied the crimes of germ warfare, and Clark, who is still continuing to deny this crime, do you dare to stand up and face this fact? Can you deny this fact?

For another example, Webb said in his confession that in early January 1952 and March 1952, Hilgerdt, then commander of the First Marine Air Wing of the U.S. Navy, was summoned to Seoul by Everest, then commander of the U.S. Fifth Air Force, and personally arranged for the 513th Night Fighter Squadron and the First Photo Squadron of the 33rd Air Group of the First Marine Air Wing to participate in the germ warfare plan. Later, the above-mentioned plan was carried out according to the instructions. Does Clark, who is now the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in Korea, dare to offer any rebuttal or correction to this fact?

Furthermore, Webb said in his confession that in late May 1952, Bakus, the new commander of the U.S. Fifth Air Force, personally conveyed the instructions for expanding germ warfare orally to Jerome, the new commander of the First Marine Air Wing of the U.S. Navy; Jerome then convened a meeting in his own office on May 25th to outline the plan to the wing's staff. Webb also participated in this meeting as the wing's chief of staff. Does Clark dare to offer any rebuttal to this fact? Do any of the other named American officers dare to come out and deny this fact?

Webb's and Bley's confessions also confessed many other facts, many dates, the names of many American officers, as well as their ranks and affiliations, the serial numbers of many American troops participating in germ warfare operations, the types of aircraft, and the airfields from which those aircraft took off, etc. For these many exposed facts, why don't Clark or any other American officials and generals dare to come forward to correct any point in them, even any unimportant point? They cannot even offer any correction to any letter in this confession. What does this show? This shows that American officials and generals are absolutely powerless in the face of ironclad facts. Clark's failure to touch any of the facts put forward by Webb and Bley in his statement fully proves that these facts are absolutely irrefutable. Since Clark cannot deny that Webb and Bley are two captured American officers who truly know the crimes of American germ warfare, and dare not refute any of the facts confessed by these two captured American officers, then his shameless attempt to deny it out of hand can only be self-defeating and further confirm the crimes of the American aggressors.

The towering crimes of the American aggressors can absolutely not be concealed. All peace-loving people in the world should immediately take effective steps to sanction the germ warfare crimes of the American aggressors.

### 美国侵略者绝对无法抵赖细菌战的罪行了——评克拉克二月二十四日的声明

    美国侵略者绝对无法抵赖细菌战的罪行了
    ——评克拉克二月二十四日的声明
    美国侵略者的野蛮残暴是世界上所少有的，它的蠢笨无耻也是世界上所少有的。当它的不可见人的罪恶在全世界正义人民的面前被公开揭露之后，美国侵略者就表现得比人们所耻笑的鸵鸟还要蠢笨。
    美国海军陆战队第一空军联队司令杰罗姆曾召集过一个会议，谈到美国细菌战的“保密”问题。当时，据被俘的美国军官许威布尔的供词说，“某一个军官指出，中国人已经声称美国使用细菌战，而自从B—29型飞机早先进行了细菌战以来，许多驾驶员已成为战俘，因此，到现在敌人（按指我方——编者注）一定已经知道使用了细菌战。”许威布尔继续说，“我们都认识到这个真理，但是正如将军
    （杰罗姆）所指出，假如政府决定否认使用，那么我们军人没有别的办法，只有尽力维持这个杜撰的说法。”美国侵略者比鸵鸟更为蠢笨的表现，就在于它要“尽力维持这个杜撰的说法”。鸵鸟在它把头埋进沙里的时候是自以为绝对安全的，而美国侵略者明知道这并不安全却还要“尽力维持这个杜撰的说法”，这就比鸵鸟更为蠢笨了。
    现在，侵朝美军总司令克拉克又摆出一个鸵鸟的蠢笨姿态来了。在听到美国被俘军官许威布尔和布莱关于美国在朝鲜进行细菌战罪行的供词之后，在美国政府陷于极端惊慌失措的情况下，克拉克于二月二十四日勉强发表了一个声明，它又一次“尽力维持杜撰的说法”。克拉克照着美国侵略者一贯的无耻腔调蠢笨地声明说，美国军队“没有在朝鲜或者任何其他地方进行过细菌战或者可能被误认为细菌战的任何其他方式的战争”。这样的一句滥调就是克拉克声明中的唯一内容，除此以外，克拉克再也拿不出其他的法宝来了。他非常勉强地表示许威布尔和布莱的供词“是不是那些不幸的被俘人员所说的还很成疑问”；他胡说这些供词是“用的折磨神经的办法”所“伪造出来”的。然而，人们都看得见，这仍然是美国侵略者一贯的“杜撰的说法”。
    全世界人民都听到了许威布尔和布莱的声音。他们的声音是那样清晰、明确、有力地发自他们的良心。他们所供述的美国进行细菌战罪行的事实，是那样地精确、扼要而又包括了许多具体的细节。发出这样声音的人不是别人，正是被俘的美国海军陆战队第一空军联队的上校参谋长和少校军械官。正是这两个熟悉美国进行细菌战罪行的丑恶内幕的美国被俘军官的话，早已戳穿了克拉克之流的声明所要“尽力维持的杜撰的说法”。如果克拉克的声明不是杜撰的胡说，那末，它为什么对于许威布尔和布莱所供述的事实不敢有丝毫反驳呢？而且所有美国侵略集团的其他官员和将军们，也都没有一个人敢于出来做丝毫的反驳呢？显然可以断定，许威布尔和布莱所供述的美国进行细菌战的事实是无法反驳的。无论在任何一点上，试问克拉克之流敢于反驳吗？
    比如，许威布尔说，在朝鲜细菌战的总计划，是由美国参谋长联席会议在一九五一年十月指示的。而这个指示是由专人送给美国远东司令部总司令李奇微，并被传达给美国的远东空军司令威兰，由他亲自召集会议进行布置的。曾经矢口否认过细菌战罪行的李奇微和现在还在继续否认这种罪行的克拉克，你们敢站出来面对这种事实吗？你们能否认这个事实吗？
    又如，许威布尔在供词中说，一九五二年一月初和一九五二年三月，当时美国海军陆战队第一空军联队司令希尔特，曾被当时美国第五航空队司令埃弗雷斯特召到汉城，并当面布置了海军陆战队第一空军联队第三十三空军大队的五一三夜间战斗机中队和第一照相机中队参加细菌战的计划，后来上述的计划都按照着指示被执行了。对于这个事实，现在身任侵朝美军总司令的克拉克敢于提出反驳和更正吗？
    再如，许威布尔在供词中说，在一九五二年五月下旬，美国第五航空队新任司令巴克斯，曾亲自将扩大细菌战的指示，口头传达给美国海军陆战队第一空军联队新任司令杰罗姆；杰罗姆又于五月二十五日在他自己的办公室内召集了一个会议，向联队的参谋部概述了这个计划。许威布尔并以联队参谋长的身份参加了这个会议。克拉克敢于对这个事实提出任何反驳吗？那些被指名的其他美国军官们有谁敢出来否认这个事实呢？
    许威布尔和布莱的供词还供述了许多其他的事实，许多日期，许多美国军官的姓名以及他们的官阶和隶属，许多参加细菌战行动的美国部队的番号、飞机的型式以及那些飞机出动的机场等等。对于这许多被揭露出来的事实，不论克拉克或是任何其他美国的官员和将军们，为什么都不敢出面来更正其中的任何一点，那怕是无关紧要的任何一点呢？他们甚至对于这个供词中的任何一个字母，也都不能提出任何更正来。这说明什么呢？这说明美国的官员和将军们面对着铁一般的事实是绝对无能为力的。克拉克在他的声明中没有敢碰一下许威布尔和布莱所提出的任何事实，就充分证明了这些事实是绝对无可辩驳的。克拉克既然不能否认许威布尔和布莱是两个真正知道美国细菌战罪行的被俘的美国军官，而又不敢反驳这两个美国被俘军官所供述的任何事实；那末，他的空口抵赖的无耻企图，就只能是心劳日拙，并且更加证实美国侵略者的罪行罢了。
    美国侵略者的滔天罪行是绝对无法掩饰的了。全世界一切爱好和平的人民，应该立即采取有效的步骤来制裁美国侵略者的细菌战罪行。
