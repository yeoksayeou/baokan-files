To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia:

We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Comrade Gottwald, the beloved leader of the Czechoslovak people and a close friend of the Chinese people. We extend our deepest condolences.

The death of Comrade Gottwald, a loyal student of Comrades Lenin and Stalin and an outstanding fighter in the international workers' movement, is a great loss not only for the Czechoslovak people but also for the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province, China, will unite more closely with the Czechoslovak people, the Soviet people, and the people of all people's democratic countries to fight to the end for the cause of peace and democracy, and for the cause of communism.
