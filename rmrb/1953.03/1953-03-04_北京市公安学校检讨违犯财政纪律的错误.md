Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Letter from the Beijing Public Security Bureau Public Security School: The reader's opinion published in the People's Daily on January 21st criticized our school for violating financial discipline. Our errors in purchasing loudspeakers without approval and violating the cash management system by accumulating cash were mainly due to the poor organizational discipline of the responsible personnel, the lack of a strict concept of complying with the system, and the bureaucratic style of leadership, with insufficient inspection of the work of the General Affairs Section. The personnel involved have made self-criticisms. In addition, we have organized the cadres of the General Affairs Section to study various financial systems and comprehensively reviewed the financial work. As for the leather gloves, they were purchased according to the provision in the supply standard that "public miscellaneous expenses include petty purchases," for all cadres of all sections and teams to use when going out on official business on public bicycles. The parts of the old loudspeaker were indeed badly damaged and a new one should have been bought; the mistake was in buying it without approval. The above two points differ from what was stated in the original letter, and are hereby clarified together.

    北京市公安学校检讨违犯财政纪律的错误
    北京市公安局公安学校来信：一月二十一日人民日报上所载读者意见对我校违犯财政纪律的问题提出批评。我们未经批准购买扩音器和违反现金管理制度积压现金的错误，主要是主管人员组织性纪律性差、缺乏严格遵守制度的观念以及领导方面有官僚主义作风、对校务科工作疏于检查所致。有关人员已作了检讨；此外，我们已组织校务科的干部学习各项财政制度，并全面检查了财政工作。至于皮手套是根据供给标准中“公杂费包括零星购置”的规定而买的，供各科、队所有干部因公骑公用自行车外出时使用。旧扩音器的机件确已损坏很多，应该买新的，错误在于买时未经批准。上述两点，原信所述有出入，特一并说明。
