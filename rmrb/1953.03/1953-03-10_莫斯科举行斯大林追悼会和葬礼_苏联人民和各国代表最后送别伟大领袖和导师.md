Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th Dispatch from TASS: On the 9th, the Soviet people gave a final farewell to the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Marshal of the Soviet Union, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.

    In the morning, in the Hall of Columns of the House of Unions, people bid their final farewell to Stalin. The leaders of the Party and government, members of the funeral committee, carried Stalin's coffin to the exit of the hall. Wreaths and red velvet cushions bearing the medals and awards Stalin received during his lifetime were also moved out of the House of Unions.

    Stalin's coffin was placed on a gun carriage. The funeral procession slowly advanced towards Red Square through the streets of the center of this ancient city. Stalin's genius transformed this ancient city, and its name, due to Stalin's wise policies, has become a symbol of peace and happiness for the people of the world.

    The people of Moscow—the sons and daughters of the great socialist country founded by Lenin and Stalin—bowed their heads in mourning before the remains of their beloved leader. Red Square was filled with representatives of Moscow's workers, staff, and intellectuals, as well as delegations from various Union Republics, Autonomous Republics, regions, and provinces of the Soviet Union. Also present in Red Square were representatives of the great Chinese people and various People's Democratic countries, delegations and representatives from other countries, and personnel from foreign diplomatic missions in the Soviet Union.

    The Moscow garrison stood silently in formation.

    The funeral procession arrived at the center of Red Square. The coffin was placed on a platform. The leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government ascended the Lenin Mausoleum platform. Then, the Stalin memorial meeting began. Georgy Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Lavrentiy Beria, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and Vyacheslav Molotov, successively spoke at the meeting. (The speeches of Beria and Molotov are published on page four.)

    After the speeches, the funeral began. The minute hand of the clock tower on the Spassky Tower of the Kremlin gradually approached twelve o'clock. The leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government walked to the front of the platform and carried Stalin's coffin into the mausoleum, placing it next to Lenin's crystal coffin.

    At this moment, artillery salutes were fired, and millions upon millions of people across the Soviet Union stood silently, bidding farewell to their beloved teacher, friend, and leader. Trains, automobiles, and ships at sea across the country came to a halt. Machines in factories and cranes at construction sites ceased operation. Only the sound of artillery salutes and the whistles of factories, trains, and ships broke the grievous silence.

    Then, the national anthem of the great socialist country of the Soviet Union was played, a country whose every achievement is inseparable from the name of Stalin. Every Soviet citizen silently recited the words of the national anthem as if taking an oath: Stalin teaches us to be loyal to the people, he inspires us to work and build meritorious achievements.

    The leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government returned to the platform. Marshals and generals of the Soviet Army also joined them on the platform.

    The Moscow garrison participating in the funeral began to bid farewell to Stalin. Formations of aircraft flew over Red Square. Soldiers of the Soviet Army, created, trained, and led to victory by Marshal Stalin, marched past the mausoleum in formation. They paid their final military salute to the greatest commander of all time and all nations. To the sound of mournful music, the people in the funeral procession walked past the mausoleum, bidding farewell to Stalin.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th Dispatch from TASS: On the 8th, an endless stream of people entered the House of Unions to bid farewell to the great Stalin.

    Delegations from various Union Republics and provinces rushed to Moscow by train and plane. A delegation of miners from Siberia, a delegation of working people from Belarus, and a delegation of workers and peasants from the Krasnodar region arrived early in the morning before the remains. Among the delegation from the heroic city of Stalingrad was veteran telegraph operator P. Sakharov, who had sent Stalin's telegram to Lenin from Tsaritsyn (now Stalingrad) during the domestic war in 1918. Nearly one hundred representatives came from the Latvian Republic on the Baltic coast. Next came representatives from the Georgian and Turkmen Republics, oil workers from Azerbaijan, miners from the Moscow coal region, collective farmers from Kyrgyzstan, textile workers from Ivanovo, horticulturalists from Michurinsk, and others.

    Representatives from Leningrad brought a large wreath, carried by an old revolutionary who had participated in the October Revolution of 1917. A delegation from Gori, Georgia, the birthplace of the great leader, presented a wreath made of roses, magnolias, and red carnations.

    Wreaths filled the Hall of Columns and the rooms adjacent to the hall, extending to the streets and squares near the House of Unions.

    In the evening, the endless stream of people continued to walk towards the Hall of Columns.

    Foreign representatives passed before the remains of J.V. Stalin. Among them were representatives of the great Chinese people, who share a solid and unbreakable friendship with the great Soviet people, the diplomatic mission of the German Democratic Republic, and representatives of the communist parties of France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Iran, Greece, India, Austria, Syria, Lebanon, Indonesia, Malaya, Pakistan, Uruguay, Colombia, Japan, and Finland.

    Wreaths from the World Peace Council and the World Federation of Trade Unions were also placed before the remains.

    Foreign diplomatic missions in the Soviet Union, the Union of Burma, and the Prime Minister of Finland sent wreaths.

    Heads of government of various People's Democratic countries, delegation members, and outstanding leaders of the international communist and workers' movements kept vigil alongside the Soviet working people.

    Those keeping vigil included: President of the Czechoslovak Republic K. Gottwald, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic B. Bierut, Marshal of Poland Rokossovsky, Premier of the Government Administration Council and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Bulgarian People's Republic V. Chervenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic M. Rákosi, General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany W. Ulbricht, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic O. Grotewohl, and Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic Tsedenbal. Also present were Italian people's leader P. Togliatti, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party D. Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain H. Pollitt, Chairman of the Communist Party of Austria Koplenig, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Finland Ville Pessi, and Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party P. Nenni.

    Government delegations from Finland and Austria, and ambassadors from several other countries passed before the remains of J.V. Stalin.

    At midnight, people continued to enter the Hall of Columns, placing wreaths before the remains of J.V. Stalin.

    Soviet government leaders, heads of people's organizations, prominent Soviet figures, and relatives and friends of the great leader took turns keeping vigil.

    苏联人民和各国代表最后送别伟大领袖和导师
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：九日，苏联人民最后送别全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师、苏联部长会议主席、苏联共产党中央委员会书记、苏联大元帅约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林。
    上午，在工会大厦圆柱大厅，人们和斯大林作了最后的告别。党和政府的领袖、治丧委员会的委员们，把斯大林的灵柩抬到大厅的出口处。花圈和安置着斯大林生前所得到的勋章与奖章的红色天鹅绒垫子，也先后移出了工会大厦。
    斯大林的灵柩安放在炮车上。送殡的行列经过这座古城中心的街道，慢慢地向红场前进。斯大林的天才改造了这座古城，它的名字由于斯大林的明智的政策已经成了全世界人民和平与幸福的象征。
    莫斯科人民——列宁和斯大林所创立的伟大社会主义国家的儿女，在他们的敬爱的领袖灵前俯首致哀。红场上聚集着莫斯科的工人、职员、知识分子的代表，苏联各加盟共和国、自治共和国、边疆区和各州的代表团。在红场上，还有伟大的中国人民和各人民民主国家的代表，其他国家的代表团和代表及各国驻苏外交使团人员。
    莫斯科的卫戍部队肃静地排列着。
    送殡的行列来到了红场的中心。灵柩安放在台架上。苏联共产党和苏联政府的领袖走到列宁墓台上。接着，斯大林的追悼大会就开始了。苏联部长会议主席、苏联共产党中央委员会书记马林科夫，苏联部长会议第一副主席贝利亚和莫洛托夫相继在会上讲话。（贝利亚和莫洛托夫的讲话载第四版）
    讲话后，葬礼开始。克里姆林宫斯巴斯基塔上大钟的时针渐渐走近十二时。苏联共产党和苏联政府的领袖们走到台架前面，把斯大林的灵柩抬到陵墓中去，放在列宁的水晶棺的旁边。
    这时，礼炮齐鸣，苏联全国千千万万人民都默默地肃立着，送别他们亲爱的导师、朋友和领袖。全国的火车、汽车和在海上航行的船只都停下来。工厂里的机器、建筑工地的起重机都停止了运转。只有礼炮声和工厂、火车、轮船的汽笛声划破这沉痛的静寂。
    接着，奏起了伟大的社会主义国家苏联的国歌，这个国家的一切成就都是和斯大林的名字分不开的。每一个苏联人民都像宣誓一样地默念着国歌的辞句：斯大林教导我们要忠实于人民，他鼓舞我们劳动去建立功勋。
    共产党和苏联政府的领袖再走到台上。苏军的元帅和将军们也一起走到台上。
    参加葬礼的莫斯科卫戍部队开始向斯大林告别。飞机编队在红场上空飞过。由斯大林大元帅所缔造、锻炼、并领导着走向胜利的苏联军队的战士们列队在陵墓前走过。他们向历代的各国人民的最伟大的统帅致最后的军礼。在哀乐声中，送葬的人民在陵墓前走过，向斯大林告别。

    花圈放满了圆柱大厅和与大厅相邻的房间，一直摆到工会大厦附近的街道上和广场上。
