    Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: According to the German News Agency on March 13th: Since the news of Comrade Stalin's serious illness arrived, up to March 12th, 1,121 working people in Berlin have applied to join the Socialist Unity Party of Germany as probationary members. The best workers in Germany are using this action to express their determination to fight in the spirit of Stalin to consolidate peace, consolidate German-Soviet friendship, and actively build the foundations of socialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 14th: Paris dispatch: The French Communist Party's movement to recruit new members in memory of Comrade Stalin has received enthusiastic support from advanced working people. In just a few days, dozens of new Party groups have been established in factories and enterprises in the Paris region alone. A sick young woman wrote to apply to join the Communist Party, saying: "Our friend has passed away, but we must have courage. His cause will live forever. I have confidence, and I ask you to accept me into your ranks. After I recover from my illness, I will do everything I can to fight with you."
    "L'Humanité" wrote on the 11th: "The movement to recruit party members in memory of Stalin is of special significance. The party's provincial committees, branches, and groups all attach importance to educating new and other party members with the doctrines of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, so that our party can correctly lead the French people in their great struggle. In this way, the day that the French bourgeoisie does not want to see, that is, the day when Stalin's thought triumphs in our country, the day when the radiance of communism shines brightly, will come sooner."

    伟大的斯大林的事业是永远长存的
    德法劳动人民纷纷申请加入共产主义政党
   【新华社十四日讯】据德意志通讯社十三日讯：自从斯大林同志重病的消息传来以后到三月十二日为止，柏林已有一千一百二十一个劳动人民申请加入德国统一社会党为候补党员。德国最优秀的工人们用这种行动来表示他们要求用斯大林的精神为巩固和平、巩固德苏友谊和积极地为建设社会主义基础而斗争的决心。
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】巴黎讯：法国共产党为纪念斯大林同志而发动的吸收新党员的运动，获得了先进劳动人民的热烈支持。几天工夫，仅仅在巴黎区，各工厂和企业中就已经成立了好几十个新的党小组。一个患病的少女写信申请参加共产党，她说：“我们的朋友逝世了，但是我们一定要有勇气。他的事业是永远长存的。我有信心，我要求你们接受我参加你们的队伍，我病愈后要尽一切力量和你们在一起奋斗。”
    “人道报”在十一日写道：“为了纪念斯大林而展开吸收党员的运动，是具有特殊意义的。党的各个省委员会、支部和小组，都重视以马克思、列宁、斯大林的学说来教育新党员和其他党员，好让我们的党能够正确地领导法国人民进行伟大的斗争。这样，法国资产阶级所不愿意见到的那一天，也就是斯大林的思想在我国胜利的日子，共产主义光芒四射的日子，就会更快地到来。”
