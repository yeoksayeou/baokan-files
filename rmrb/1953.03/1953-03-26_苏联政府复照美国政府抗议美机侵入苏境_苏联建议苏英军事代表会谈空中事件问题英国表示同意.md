Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 25th, TASS dispatch: The United States Embassy in the Soviet Union, on the instructions of the United States Government, presented a note to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 18th. The note claimed that on March 15th, an American Air Force "R·B-50" aircraft was allegedly attacked by Soviet fighters in the open sea at 54 degrees 02 minutes north latitude and 161 degrees 04 minutes east longitude (off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula). The American note protested this incident.

The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a reply note to the United States Embassy in the Soviet Union on March 21st. The full text of the note is as follows:

"Regarding Note No. 683 from the Embassy of the United States of America, dated March 18, 1953, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics deems it necessary to state the following:

According to verified materials, at 11:57 a.m. (local time) on March 15th of this year, an American 'B-29' type bomber flew into the 'Krestov' Cape area (in the southern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula), intruded into the Soviet border, and flew 70 kilometers over Kamchatka territory, 15-17 kilometers from the coast, turning towards the sea when approaching the 'Mutnovsk' Mountain.

At 12:26 p.m., an American 'B-29' type bomber reappeared, flew to the 'Zhupanov' residential area northeast of Petropavlovsk, Kamchatka Peninsula, and intruded into the Soviet border.

The weather was good during these two incidents, and the flight personnel could observe at a distance, making it impossible to lose their way. This proves that the above two incidents of violating the Soviet border were definitely deliberate.

When two Soviet fighters took off and approached the American bomber that was violating the Soviet border for the second time, the intruding aircraft fired on the Soviet fighters. One of the Soviet aircraft was forced to return fire in self-defense, whereupon the intruding aircraft turned around, flew away from the Soviet coast, and disappeared to the east.

The above facts prove that the protest lodged by the United States Government in its note of March 18th of this year is unfounded, and therefore, the Soviet Government refuses to accept this protest.

In view of the materials cited above confirming the fact that an American aircraft violated the Soviet border, the Soviet Government lodges a protest with the United States Government regarding the aforementioned border violation and demands that the United States Government take appropriate measures to prevent future incidents of American aircraft violating the Soviet border."

Xinhua News Agency, March 25th, Berlin dispatch: Recently, British aircraft have repeatedly violated the regulations on the demarcation of air corridors and intruded into the borders of the German Democratic Republic over the territory of the German Democratic Republic. In order to defend the airspace of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet occupation air force took warning actions against aircraft crossing the border in accordance with aviation regulations. On one occasion, a British bomber refused to comply with the regulations and fired on a Soviet fighter that had issued a warning to it, and was immediately shot down by the Soviet aircraft in retaliation. Colonel General Chuikov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany, wrote to Sir Kirkpatrick, British High Commissioner in West Germany, to protest this matter.

The American, British, and French occupation authorities in West Germany have used the aircraft border crossing incident to write to the Soviet occupation authorities, deliberately distorting the facts and falsely claiming that Soviet aircraft have committed acts of aggression, in an attempt to increase tension.

On March 18th, Colonel General Chuikov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany, wrote again in reply to Sir Kirkpatrick, British High Commissioner in West Germany, exposing the Western occupation authorities' distortion and fabrication of facts, and demanding that he take necessary measures to ensure that British aircraft strictly abide by the existing rules when flying in the air corridors. Colonel General Chuikov also suggested that fully authorized Soviet and British military representatives hold an appropriate meeting in Berlin to jointly discuss specific measures to ensure that aircraft fly in accordance with the rules and to prevent air incidents.

According to a Reuters report, British Prime Minister Churchill stated in Parliament on the 24th, in response to questions from members of parliament, that he agreed to accept the Soviet proposal.

    苏联政府复照美国政府抗议美机侵入苏境
    苏联建议苏英军事代表会谈空中事件问题英国表示同意
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：美国驻苏联大使馆奉美国政府命令曾在三月十八日以照会一件递交苏联外交部。照会声称：三月十五日，有美国空军“R·B—五十”型飞机一架，在北纬五十四度零二和东经一百六十一度零四地方（在堪察加半岛海岸）的公海上空受到苏联战斗机的所谓攻击。美国照会就这一事件提出抗议。
    苏联外交部在三月二十一日以复照一件递交美国驻苏联大使馆，照会全文如下：
    “关于美利坚合众国大使馆一九五三年三月十八日第六百八十三号照会，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部认为有必要声明如下：
    根据已经证实的材料，今年三月十五日十一时五十七分（当地时间）有‘B—二十九’型美国轰炸机一架，飞到‘克列斯托夫’角地区（在堪察加半岛南部），侵入苏联国境，并在堪察加境内离海岸十五—十七公里地带上空飞行了七十公里，在将到‘穆特诺夫斯克’冈时，转向海中飞去。
    十二时二十六分，‘B—二十九’型美国轰炸机一架再度出现，飞到堪察加半岛彼得罗巴夫罗夫斯克市东北‘茹帕诺夫’居住区，侵入苏联国境。
    发生这两次事件时气候良好，飞行人员在远距离时就能进行观察，决无迷失方向的可能，这证实上述两次侵犯苏联国境的事件肯定是蓄意的。
    当两架苏联战斗机起飞并飞近第二次侵犯苏联国境的美国轰炸机时，该侵犯国境的飞机即向苏联战斗机开火。苏联飞机中有一架为了自卫被迫回击，于是，侵犯国境的飞机才掉转头来，飞离苏联海岸，在东方不见了。
    上述事实证明：美国政府在今年三月十八日的照会中提出的抗议是毫无根据的，因此，苏联政府拒绝接受这个抗议。
    鉴于上面引证的材料证实了一架美国飞机侵犯苏联国境的事实，苏联政府特就上述侵犯国境事件向美国政府提出抗议，并要求美国政府采取适当的措施来防止将来再有美国飞机侵犯苏联国境的事件发生。”
    【新华社二十五日讯】柏林消息：最近，在德意志民主共和国领土上空曾屡次发生英国飞机破坏关于空中走廊分界线的规定、侵入德意志民主共和国边界的事件。苏联占领空军为保卫德意志民主共和国的领空，曾按航空规则对越界飞机采取警告行动，其中一次一架英国轰炸机拒绝遵守规章，并对向它发出警告的苏联战斗机开火，当即被苏机还击击落。苏联驻德占领军总司令崔可夫上将曾就这事写信给英国驻西德高级专员柯克帕特里克，提出抗议。
    西德美、英、法三国占领当局曾利用飞机越界事件，写信给苏联占领当局，故意颠倒黑白，硬说苏联飞机有侵犯行为，企图借此增加紧张空气。
    苏联占领军总司令崔可夫上将在三月十八日又写信答复英国驻西德高级专员柯克帕特里克，揭露西方占领当局歪曲和捏造事实，并要求他采取必要的措施，以保证英国飞机在空中走廊飞行时严格遵守现行的规则。崔可夫上将同时建议由苏联与英国的全权军事代表在柏林举行适当的会议，共同讨论采取具体措施来保证飞机的飞行遵照规则及防止空中事件。
    据路透社消息，英国首相邱吉尔二十四日在议会回答议员的责问时表示同意接受苏联的这一建议。
