    Overcoming Chaotic Phenomena in Cantonese Opera Reform

    After returning from the First National Opera Performance and Observation Conference, the opera circles in Guangdong Province initiated a discussion on the reform of Cantonese opera, starting with the criticism of the Cantonese opera "San Chun审父" (San Chun Judges Her Father). This is absolutely necessary.

    "San Chun审父" is an old Cantonese opera program that has been modified. The Guangdong opera circles and cultural leading authorities originally intended to recommend this play to Beijing to participate in the conference, but it was stopped after criticism from higher-level leaders.

    The story of "San Chun审父" is as follows: A young girl named Tao San Chun is abused by her stepmother. A passing young man sympathizes with her and writes a poem in the back garden. This poem becomes the basis for the stepmother's slander, saying that San Chun is corresponding with a lover. Tao's father then forces San Chun to commit suicide. In order to "prove her innocence," San Chun throws herself into the river and is rescued by an official who adopts her as his goddaughter. With the help of her adoptive father, San Chun disguises herself to take the imperial examination, becomes the top scholar, and becomes a high-ranking official. When she is ordered to interrogate her father for a certain crime, the truth is revealed, and the father and daughter recognize each other in court.

    This is a cleverly disguised play that supports feudal ethics and the feudal social order, because from beginning to end, it does not oppose the feudal system. San Chun does not dare to have free love, and she has no love for the passing young man. Precisely in order to prove her "innocence," to show that she has not violated a single hair of feudal morality and feudal rule, she obeys her father's order and commits suicide by drowning. After being rescued, she desperately climbs to the position of feudal ruler according to the feudal social order, and proves to her father that she is also a loyal slave of feudal society.

    The Guangdong opera circles and cultural leading authorities, however, regard such a play that promotes feudal morality as an "anti-feudal" work. This shows the confusion in the ideological thinking of some opera work cadres (including some leading cadres) in Guangdong regarding opera reform. Under such circumstances, the work of Cantonese opera reform cannot embark on the correct path.

    Cantonese opera is one of the outstanding types of national opera. There are also many creative and patriotic Cantonese opera artists. Cantonese opera has also shown certain achievements in musical reform in the past. However, for decades, under the ideological erosion of imperialism and comprador bourgeoisie, its mainstream has been pushed onto a serious path of colonialization and commercialization, gradually eliminating and losing its original national characteristics and realistic traditions. Many excellent traditional programs of the past have been abandoned, replaced by extremely absurd and vulgar so-called "new" programs. Many of these programs are adapted from degenerate pornographic novels or movie stories, and many others directly adopt the reactionary film themes of Hollywood. They blindly pursue "novelty" and "excitement" in the content of the scripts and performance forms, in order to cater to the low-level tastes of the petty bourgeoisie and numb the minds of the audience. Since liberation, some of our Cantonese opera reformers (including some leading cadres) have remained indifferent to the degenerate path of Cantonese opera, and have seized on this already-deteriorated thing to carry out some "reform" work in a piecemeal manner, thus promoting this degenerate tendency. For example, in order to ensure that the "six main actors" all have roles to play, a pair of siblings played by a clown and a second supporting actress are added to the play "Hong Niangzi" for no reason, creating gimmicks. In order to cater to "excitement" and surprise the audience, Da Chun in "The White-Haired Girl" suddenly runs onto the stage from behind the audience seats; and in "Liu Yongfu," there is a magic performance of drinking poison. In order to cater to "changing scenery," the "Mandarin Duck Sword" features scenes of young masters and ladies enjoying themselves in the four seasons. In order to cater to "matching male and female leads," a beautiful woman is forcibly paired with the loyal King Li Xiucheng in "Hero's Lapel, Flowers of Peace." These plays are all newly written. In the entire Cantonese opera world, all sorts of chaotic things such as "movie expressions," "colorful sets," and "celluloid costumes" are rampant. This approach is moving further and further away from the correct direction of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new."

    The current study movement in the Cantonese opera world should be a good start to the mass-based opera reform work. It is necessary to rescue Cantonese opera from the path of degeneration, restore the national tradition and local characteristics that have been ravaged and destroyed, and carry out correct reforms in accordance with the State Council's "Instructions on Opera Reform Work" so that it neither harms the inherent beautiful characteristics nor conforms to the requirements of the broad masses of the people. Opera work cadres in various places should take this example of Cantonese opera as a warning, resolutely eliminate the bad tendencies of commercialization and formalism currently existing in local operas, and resolutely fight against the erroneous thoughts and behaviors that condone or even promote these bad tendencies.

### 克服粤剧改革中的混乱现象

    克服粤剧改革中的混乱现象
    广东省戏曲界在参加第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会回去后，以批判粤剧“三春审父”为起点，展开了对粤剧改革问题的讨论。这是完全必要的。
    “三春审父”是经过修改后的粤剧旧节目。广东戏曲界和文化领导机关原来准备推荐这个剧目到北京来参加会演，后经上级领导同志批评阻止而作罢。
    “三春审父”的故事是这样的：少女陶三春受后母虐待，一个过路的青年同情她，在后花园题了一首诗。这诗便成为后母进谗的资料，说三春和情人唱和。陶父便逼三春自杀，三春为“表明清白”起见，投了河，后被一个做官的救起，收为义女。三春在义父帮助下，改装应考，中了状元，做了大官，奉旨审问她父亲的某一罪案时，才暴露了真相，父女公堂相认。
    这是一个伪装得很巧妙的拥护封建伦理、封建社会秩序的戏，因为它从头到尾，并没有反对封建制度；三春不敢自由恋爱，她和那个过路青年也并没有爱情。正是为了表明自己的“清白”，为了说明她并没有触犯封建道德和封建统治的一根毫毛，她才顺从父亲的命令，投水自杀的。遇救后，她又按着封建社会秩序拼命地爬上封建统治者的地位，并在她父亲面前证明自己也是封建社会的忠实奴才。
    广东戏曲界和文化领导机关却将这样一个宣扬封建道德的戏，看成一个“反封建”的作品，这说明了广东某些戏曲工作干部（包括一些领导干部在内）在戏曲改革思想上的混乱。在这样情况下进行的粤剧改革工作，也就无法走上正确的道路。
    粤剧本是我们民族戏曲的优秀剧种之一。粤剧艺人中也有不少是有创造性的、富有爱国心的，粤剧已往在音乐的改革上也表现了一定的成绩。但是，几十年来，在帝国主义和买办资产阶级的思想侵蚀之下，它的主流，被推上了严重的殖民地化和商业化的道路，逐渐消灭和丧失了原有的民族色彩和现实主义传统。已往的许多优秀的传统剧目被抛弃了，而代之以非常荒唐下流的所谓“新”剧目；这些剧目有许多是根据堕落的黄色小说或电影故事改编的，有许多则是直接采用了好莱坞的反动电影题材，在剧本内容和演出形式上一味追求“新奇”和“刺激”，用以迎合小市民的低级趣味，麻醉观众的心灵。而解放以来，我们的一些粤剧改革工作者（包括一些领导干部），眼看着粤剧走上了堕落的道路而无动于衷，还抓住这种已经变了质的东西，枝枝节节地进行一些“改革”工作，因而助长了这种堕落的倾向。譬如为了照顾“六条台柱”都有戏做，“红娘子”一剧便无端加进了丑生和二帮花旦饰演的一对兄妹在插科打诨，制造噱头。为了照顾“刺激”，要使观众惊奇，“白毛女”里的大春便突然从观众座后跑上舞台；而“刘永福”里便有饮毒酒的魔术表演。为了照顾“摆景变景”，“鸳鸯剑”里便出现了少爷小姐的春夏秋冬四季行乐图。为了照顾“生旦对手”，“英雄襟上太平花”里便硬给忠王李秀成配上一个美女。这些剧本还都是新编的。在整个的粤剧界中，泛滥着“电影表情”、“七彩布景”、“胶片服装”等乱七八糟的东西。这种做法，离开“百花齐放、推陈出新”的正确方向是愈来愈远了。
    粤剧界目前正在进行的学习运动，应该是群众性的戏曲改革工作的良好开端，必须把粤剧从堕落的道路上挽救出来，恢复那被糟踏、被破坏了的民族传统和地方色彩，必须根据政务院“关于戏曲改革工作的指示”，进行正确的改革，使它既不损害固有的优美特色，同时又符合广大人民的要求。各地的戏曲工作干部，应该以粤剧的这个例子为鉴戒，坚决肃清目前存在于地方戏曲中的商业化、形式主义的恶劣倾向，坚决向迁就甚至助长这些恶劣倾向的错误思想和行为作斗争。
