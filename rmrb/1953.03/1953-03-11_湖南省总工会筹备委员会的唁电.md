To the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions:

We are deeply saddened to learn of the unfortunate passing of Comrade J.V. Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world. The death of Comrade Stalin is a great loss to the people of the world. But the cause led by Comrade Stalin is an invincible cause. We, the working class of Chairman Mao's hometown, will, together with the people of the whole country, with unwavering confidence and perseverance, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, deeply promote the movement to increase production and practice economy, continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, so as to rapidly advance the construction of our motherland, and unite more closely with the Soviet people to fight to the end for the cause of world peace and democracy.
