Shenyang Clothing Factory No. 1 Earnestly Implements the Marriage Law and Achieves Results

    Over the past few years, Shenyang Clothing Factory No. 1 has earnestly implemented the Marriage Law, gaining good experience and results. Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, 149 young men and women in the factory have freely married and are living happy and fulfilling lives; the phenomena of arranged marriages and family disharmony have been greatly reduced. Happy and fulfilling family life has enabled male and female workers to focus more on production, and their enthusiasm for labor has been fully utilized. In the past, the factory's workers held feudal ideas of "male superiority over female inferiority," and male and female workers were generally unwilling to work together; now, the advanced work method of Jiang Wanshou's improved labor organization has been implemented, with female "helpers" and male "machine operators" cooperating in production, and the factory's production efficiency has increased by 25 percent. The factory's average output has consistently maintained the highest level among clothing factories in the Northeast region.
    The good work of Shenyang Clothing Factory No. 1 in implementing the Marriage Law is mainly due to the importance attached to it by the leading cadres. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the leading cadres of the factory organized workers to study the Marriage Law and improved the status of female workers in all aspects. In the past, the factory had various feudal malpractices that discriminated against female workers, such as female workers not being allowed to be "machine operators," foot-bound women not being given work clothes, and older women being forced to retire from the factory. After liberation, male workers generally looked down on female workers, believing that they could not move the machine heads and that they were merely "helpers"; the inferiority complex of female workers was also very serious. In order to reverse this phenomenon, the leading cadres of the factory used many concrete facts to educate the workers. In the second half of 1950, a workshop was specially equipped to train female "machine operators." As a result, more than 200 skilled workers were trained and assigned to various workshops, and they demonstrated the moving of machine heads and various operating techniques. Subsequently, discussions were organized among the workers of the factory to criticize the erroneous understanding of female workers. Education was also carried out specifically among female workers, introducing the brilliant achievements of Soviet female workers to strengthen their self-confidence. At the same time, the factory also promoted a large number of female workers to participate in the leading work of various departments. In this way, the idea of equality between men and women and mutual love began to take root among the workers.
    The leading cadres of the factory also vigorously carried out recreational activities to create opportunities for public interaction, aiming at the feudal consciousness still remaining among male and female workers and their lack of familiarity with each other. The factory formed an amateur cultural troupe of more than 150 people, whose members were young male and female workers from various workshops. In addition, each workshop established a cultural and recreational activity group. More than 500 workers in the factory participated in such a team to carry out cultural and recreational activities. They regularly held literary and artistic performances in various workshops, and the programs performed reflected the production situation and eliminated feudal consciousness. The whole factory or each workshop also held dances on festivals and weekends. Through proper cultural and recreational life, male and female workers had normal social activities and gradually changed their remaining feudal ideas. Whenever there was a break, the accordion of the cultural troupe would play on the broadcasting station, and the male and female workers from various workshops would gather to sing and dance, and even the older female and male workers were equally willing to participate in these activities.
    In order to implement the Marriage Law, the leading cadres of the clothing factory also did many other specific tasks. The women workers' committee of the trade union organized family visit groups, who often explained the Marriage Law to the families of workers, supported the freedom of marriage for young men and women, and helped families with disharmony to solve problems. They also collected good and bad typical events, organized workers to discuss them, and made them further realize the benefits of the Marriage Law. In addition, the factory also paid attention to linking the solution of workers' marriage problems with the interests of production. In signing collective contracts, workers guaranteed production, and the administrative side guaranteed to do a good job in workers' welfare, one of which was: when more than three couples of workers get married in the factory, the factory would prepare some simple refreshments. The factory has held many such weddings, and the married workers are willing to hold their weddings in the factory.

### 沈阳被服一厂认真贯彻婚姻法获得成绩

    沈阳被服一厂认真贯彻婚姻法获得成绩
    沈阳被服一厂几年来认真地贯彻婚姻法，获得良好的经验和效果。全厂自婚姻法公布以来，已有一百四十九对青年男女自由结婚，过着幸福美满的生活；包办婚姻和家庭不和睦的现象大大减少。美满幸福的家庭生活，使男女工人们更加安心生产，劳动积极性得以充分发挥。过去该厂工人中存在“男尊女卑”的封建思想，男女工人总不愿意在一起做活；现在推行了姜万寿改进劳动组织的先进工作法，由女“帮工”和男“机工”配合生产，全厂生产效率提高了百分之二十五。全厂的平均产量在东北区被服工厂中始终保持最高的水平。
    沈阳被服一厂贯彻婚姻法的工作做得好，主要是因为领导干部的重视。婚姻法颁布后，该厂领导干部就组织工人学习婚姻法，并从各方面来提高女工的地位。该厂过去存在着歧视女工的各种封建恶习，如女工不能做“机工”，缠足的不发给工作服，岁数大的就迫令退厂等。解放后，男工们还是普遍看不起女工，认为她们搬不动机器头，她们是
    “下手”；女工的自卑心理也很严重。该厂领导干部为了扭转这种现象，用很多具体事实向工人进行教育。一九五零年下半年，专门设备了一个车间，训练女“机工”，结果共培养出二百多名技术工人，分配到各车间工作，并由她们表演了搬动机器头和各种操作技术。接着，在全厂工人中，组织讨论，批判了对女工的错误认识，又专门在女工中进行教育，介绍苏联女工的光辉成就，以加强她们的自信心。同时，该厂还提拔了大批女工参加各部门的领导工作。这样，男女平等和互相友爱的思想就在工人中开始树立起来。
    该厂领导干部又针对着男女工人中还残存着封建意识、互相间不习惯接近的情况，大力开展文娱活动，创造公开社交的机会。该厂组成了一百五十余人的业余文工团，团员都是各车间的青年男女工人。此外，每个车间还都建立了文化娱乐活动小组。全厂共有五百多工人参加了这样一支开展文化娱乐活动的队伍。他们定期举行各车间的文艺表演，表演的节目都以反映生产情况和消除封建意识为内容。每逢节日和周末，全厂或各车间还举行舞会。经过正当的文化娱乐生活，男女工人们便有了正常的社交活动，逐渐改变了封建的残余思想。每当休息时间，文工团的手风琴在广播台上一拉，各车间的男女工人，便集中起来唱歌和跳舞，连老年女工和男工也同样愿意参加这些活动。
    被服一厂的领导干部为了贯彻婚姻法，还做了其他很多具体工作。工会的女工委员会组织了家庭访问组，经常到工人家属中讲解婚姻法，支持青年男女的婚姻自由和帮助不和睦的家庭解决问题，并收集好、坏典型事件，组织工人进行讨论，使他们进一步认识婚姻法的好处。此外，该厂还注意把帮助解决工人的婚姻问题和生产的利益联系起来。在签订集体合同时，工人保证生产，行政方面保证办好工人福利，其中一项便是：有三对以上的工人在厂内结婚时，厂里给准备一些简单的茶点。该厂已经举办了很多次这样的婚礼，结婚的工人都愿意在厂内举行婚礼。
