The Marriage Law Saved Me
Xu Saijiao spoke
Po Xuan recorded

I grew up suffering from a young age. When my parents had me, our family was already impoverished by the landlord's exploitation. My father's eyesight was poor, and he needed my uncle's help to cultivate a few plots of land; we worried about tomorrow after eating today. At seven, I could hold the ox's nose and worked as a cowherd for others to get some food. When I was eight, my uncle died, and my father had less help, making life even harder. Poor people always went downhill in the past. When I was thirteen, things took a turn for the worse, and my father sprained his foot.

Unable to make ends meet, my family relied on me to chop firewood and sell a few liters of rice to get some porridge to drink. My father said, "Saijiao, we struggled to raise you, but we have bad luck and can't support you. Your parents are afraid you'll suffer poverty, so it's better to find you a husband!" As fate would have it, that year, Liu Tianbao, a rich peasant from Qingtang Township (under the Fifth District of Poyang County, Jiangxi Province), asked someone to be a matchmaker. The matchmaker was Xu Yanbao, Liu Tianbao's brother-in-law and a puppet Baozhang (local head). He had money and power, and the people of Poyang Lake were afraid of him. He told my father a pack of lies, saying, "If you marry into the Liu family, you'll have everything you need," and "My brother-in-law can carry over a hundred catties and is a good young man." My father was sick in bed, only hoping I would have a way out, and didn't say anything; my mother had never left the house and knew nothing; the neighbors saw that the Baozhang was the matchmaker and didn't dare to say anything. So, they took my birthdate to the Liu family. Afterwards, I found out that Liu Tianbao was a crooked-mouthed, lame lunatic who couldn't hold chopsticks properly and spoke with his mouth pointing to the sky. I thought, how could I marry such a husband? My heart was broken! I didn't dare to cry in front of my parents, fearing they would be saddened, so I ran to the fields to cry, to the mountains to cry. I said, "Heavens! How could such a terrible thing happen!"

After that, I truly lived as if I was in a boiling oil pot. When chopping firewood, I thought of Liu Tianbao's appearance, and my hands went soft; when working in the fields, I thought that Liu Tianbao was going to be my husband, and my heart panicked. When I was seventeen, the Liu family came to say they would choose a date to marry me. I was so anxious that I didn't know what to do. I cried to my parents, "I'd rather die than marry such a person!" My parents said, "Daughter! For all the bad things, it's always the parents' fault. Since you've been promised to them, what can we do?" I couldn't blame my parents, nor could I obey them. I thought: My parents gave birth to me, hoping I would grow up, hoping I could support the family and raise my younger brother; I could carry things on my shoulders and do things with my hands, so I couldn't be so weak and should make my own decisions. I thought of a plan and said to the people from the Liu family, "Uncles and aunties, please speak kindly to my in-laws. My younger brother is still young and can't help much. In a couple of years, when he's older, I can set my parents' minds at ease and marry him." The Liu family figured I couldn't escape their grasp, so they agreed, and my heart felt a little relieved!

However, in the old society, bad dogs only bite people in ragged clothes. I resisted the Liu family, but I couldn't resist the mouths of the villagers. Wang Yueying, the wife of the landlord Dayanpao in our village, never had anyone else in her eyes, let alone us poor people. As soon as I backed out of the marriage with the Liu family, her mouth started up. She said:

"Keeping the girl at home to chop firewood and pull weeds, refusing to marry, she's bound to give birth to a
'bastard'!" Some narrow-minded people, hearing her say this, also spread rumors that my parents were "really confused, letting their daughter work outside all day long, and there's bound to be something going on." At first, I was very annoyed when I heard this; later, I thought: I walk upright and sit steadily, relying on my own strength to eat, what is there to be afraid of! I simply let it go in one ear and out the other, let them toads croak blindly, it won't affect a single hair on Xu Saijiao's head.

I struggled and endured, farming and planting, braving wind and rain, always hoping that my younger brother would grow up quickly so that he could support my parents. But whenever I thought of my own situation, it felt like a stone was hanging in my heart, weighing me down. In 1949, just as I was worrying that the Liu family would come and force me to marry them one day, the People's Liberation Army crossed the river! As soon as the red flag was raised in the village, the poor people saw the sun. I was overjoyed! I said: No more fear of landlords forcing debts, no more fear of Baozhangs forcing marriage!

In June, the township organized a peasant association, which was very lively, and I became the leader of the women's group. Then came the class division, followed by rent reduction, interest rate reduction, and anti-hegemony after the new year. The cannon of liberation sounded, and the suffering people were truly happy! In May 1950, the district cadres held a meeting and said, "Chairman Mao has promulgated the Marriage Law! Marriage should be based on the free will of both men and women!" When I heard this, I was overjoyed, and I ran home full of joy, wanting to tell my father. But my father immediately stopped me and asked, "Saijiao, are you a group leader, or are you a soldier?" "Will the Communist Party leave after doing this?" His question worried me again. I knew that the old man had suffered enough from others in the past and was afraid of things changing, which was understandable. If I didn't get through to him, the work wouldn't be done well, and I wouldn't be able to dissolve the marriage contract. I couldn't think of a good way myself, so I consulted with the comrades at work. Several female comrades came to my house one after another to help, using metaphors, calculating the details, using facts, and talking about the benefits of the Communist Party. My father thought of the landlord Xu Yanlu forcing debts and taking away our sesame seeds, thought of the landlord Dayanpao's son hitting me, and saw that land reform work teams had come to each village to distribute land, so he said, "The Communist Party is really good, and the world will be at peace for a long time!" In this way, he set his mind at ease about me. I took the opportunity to test his tone and talk about dissolving my marriage contract. At first, he still didn't agree, saying, "Doing this will offend many people!" I said, "Landlords and local bullies must be overthrown, what's there to be afraid of!" He said:
    "We don't want to be bad people." I couldn't help myself, and I said, "Dad, let me decide my own affairs!" In November, I went to the township government to propose dissolving the marriage contract with the Liu family. The township formalities were not completed, and land reform began. I was busy mobilizing the masses to fight the landlords and measure the land (I was then a village women's representative and a member of the township government), so the matter of dissolving the marriage was put aside. In March 1951, the district government took the lead and found Liu Tianbao and me to talk about dissolving the marriage contract. Liu Tianbao said, "Xu Saijiao said she would be my wife, and she promised me that when her younger brother grew up, she would marry me. It's not right for me to dissolve the marriage contract!" I said, "Your brother-in-law said you could carry over a hundred catties, I didn't know that before, show me you can carry fifty catties today! If you can carry it, I'll marry you!" Liu Tianbao panicked when he heard me say this! He was flustered and stuttering, unable to say a word for a long time. The district head said, "Forget it! Marriage cannot be forced, it's better to be happy and cancel the marriage contract!" Liu Tianbao
    "I...I..." still wanted to "I..." what, the district head said, "Go!" I thanked Heaven and Earth, and a stone was lifted from my heart.

The day after the dissolution of the marriage contract, Liu Tianbao still didn't give up and gathered many people to rush to my house, saying that I had to take 2,600 catties of grain to the Liu family to get back the "birthdate." I said, "I don't have it!" The people from the Liu family slapped the table and said they wanted to have a meal, or they would break my family's pots! Some people shouted, "Regardless of anything, hang her up first!" I ran to the township head's house and asked the township head to judge. The township head said, "Go to the district!" The district said, "The Marriage Law is clearly stated here, whoever tries to stop it is making a mistake!" The people from the Liu family couldn't stand the rebuttal, packed their baskets with loaches, and slipped away one by one.

With the rotten rope of the Liu family cut, I was full of energy, production was joyful, my parents were happy, and the villagers spread the news about my affairs as something fresh. Some said it was good, some said it was bad. Regardless of what others said, I had made up my mind: I must not fail the grace of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I must set a good example, first for myself, and second to be a model for others. After that, I worked more actively, produced whenever I had time, and cultivated the land more carefully. Many people came to propose marriage. Liu Guihua from our village wanted me to be her daughter-in-law and asked a matchmaker to say, "If Saijiao is willing to marry my son, I don't care how much the dowry is, thirty piculs is thirty piculs, fifty piculs is fifty piculs!" My mother asked me, and I said, "It's still arranged marriage and buying and selling, I won't go!" Someone from the Liu family in Qingtang Township also came to propose marriage, saying that "a daughter-in-law from Qingtang Township should still marry in Qingtang Township." I said:
    "I don't want someone I didn't choose myself!" Seeing my firm attitude, they talked to my mother: "A daughter's marriage should still be decided by her parents!" When I heard this, I was even more angry, and I said, "The Marriage Law promulgated by Chairman Mao, every sentence cannot be discounted, no one can control the marriage of children!" At this point, my mother and many gossiping people shut their mouths and said, "You choose!"

I will of course choose. First, I want to choose someone with a suffering background and good class status; second, I want to choose someone who is good at labor and capable of production; and third, I want to choose someone with progressive ideas. I thought: Even if I can't find an object that has all three, I have to help him achieve these. Cai Zhiying, who lives in Mapengli across the river from our village, is an honest farmer. In the past, when I was suffering, I went to the mountains in Mapengli to extract bamboo shoots. I knew him, and I also knew that his family was poor in the past. He and his mother helped people look after the mountains and grow crops, and they had even begged for food before. Bitter people turned over together, the foundation is the same, not to mention love him, even talking to him, the heart is easy to twist into one! In December 1951, we met, he milled rice, and I washed vegetables. At first, we were still a little embarrassed, saying half a sentence and keeping half a sentence. An old man came over with a smile and said, "It's really good that you two are paired up!" I thought: If you want to say it, just say it! I asked Cai Zhiying if he could accept my opinions. Cai Zhiying said, "Tell me what you think!" I said, "We are all people who turned over because of Chairman Mao. If we don't forget our roots, we should work harder in production and do a good job in local work!" He said, "That's right!" Then I told him my conditions, and I told him not to be afraid of not being able to do it, just work hard. Finally, I solemnly added, "If we get married, you must guarantee that you won't hold me back and let me do my work well!" He also agreed in one breath.

In March 1952, Cai Zhiying and I got married. My husband and I go in and out of the fields together, discussing everything. In terms of farming, Cai Zhiying is good at labor, but his planning is a bit poor. For example, when harvesting rapeseed in the first half of the year, he was in a hurry to busy with the work in the fields. I said, "It doesn't matter if the fields are a little late, the rapeseed must be harvested first, for fear of rain!" He followed my words and harvested two and a half loads of rapeseed with me. As soon as the loads entered the house, it really rained, and it rained for seven or eight days. He said, "Saijiao, this is really well done! Next time I really have to discuss it with you more!" After that, we discussed all the work in the fields. When working, I always looked for opportunities to help Cai Zhiying progress. I told him the truth about poor people turning over, and I advised him not only to understand how to be the master of the house, but also to be able to be the master of the house. At first, he was afraid that his mother-in-law would hold him back, and he didn't even want to be a militia member. I said, "We still have to get through to our mother's thinking, we can't let her old ideas hold us back!" Slowly, he also asked to progress, not only stepping up production, but also striving to become a backbone militia member, and also joined the Communist Youth League. Recently, thanks to the party's cultivation, he has also become a glorious probationary member of the Communist Party!

When my mother-in-law first entered the door, she had two concerns in her mind: one was that I would delay work as a cadre, and the other was that I would encourage my husband to participate in work and be transferred away. In May, when my husband and I came home after hitting hemp, my mother-in-law said, "Saijiao, you better not go out, just do the laundry and make shoes at home. Besides, the land reform is over, the review is also over, the revolution is successful, and you don't have to be a cadre anymore. There are thousands of women in our township, and we are not afraid of not being able to choose a director of the women's representative meeting; there are more than two thousand men, and we are not afraid of no one being a militia member!" I paused when I heard this, and waited for her to calm down before I opened my mouth and said, "Mother-in-law, we were all people who suffered enough in the past, and we were able to have such a good day today thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and we fought such a good world. We poor people are in charge, if we don't be cadres ourselves, wouldn't we let the landlords be cadres and ride on our heads again?" Then I said, "We still have a lot of things to do, let's take the example of the local bully landlord Cai Zhixian: a few days ago, he fled and put up a note in Hexia saying that he had drowned himself in the river, and everyone couldn't find him day and night, but on the third day he was caught on the Shiban Bridge. Look, the landlords are still not giving up, if we slack off, our jobs won't be secure!" Hearing my advice, my mother-in-law's bitter water from her early years also came to her heart. Seeing that she was also in pain in her heart, I quickly reversed and said, "Mother-in-law, my husband and I will definitely achieve both work and production, and you can see our good harvest in the second half of the year!" She said, "Good! Good!" Really, when we harvested rice in August, our family's eight acres of land harvested 37 piculs of dry rice, one-third more than the previous year. My mother-in-law saw it and smiled!

My mother-in-law lives in a mountain ravine, and at first she didn't want to come out to listen to the meetings, but now she attends every meeting and understands a lot of revolutionary principles. People saw that she was happy and smiled at her, asking her why she was so stubborn in the past? She said, "Old and confused, didn't understand the policy!" Some asked her why she was so happy now, she said, "Lost the begging stick, it's getting better year by year, my son married a good daughter-in-law, they are all cadres, they are all party members, and the daughter-in-law is still a model, how can I not be happy?" She pointed to the portrait of Chairman Mao and said, "Isn't it all because he led well, that we have today!"

    婚姻法解救了我
    徐赛娇　讲
    鄱宣　记
    我是自幼受苦长大的。爷娘生我时，家底子就被地主剥穷了。爹爹的眼不好，种几块田，要叔叔帮忙；家里吃今朝，愁明朝。七岁我能拉得住牛鼻子，就给人家看牛，混口饭吃。八岁那年叔叔死了，爹爹少了帮手，日子更难过。穷人在过去净走下坡路，我十三岁时，偏又雪上加霜，爹爹的脚拐了。
    一家没法子，就靠我砍柴卖几升米弄碗粥喝。爹爹说：“赛娇呀，七拉八扯把你养大，偏又命不好，供不住你，爷娘怕你受穷，还是找个人家吧！”冤家遇对头，就在这年，清塘乡（属江西省鄱阳县第五区）有个富农刘天保托人来说媒。媒人是刘天保的姐夫、伪保长徐彦保。他有钱有势，鄱阳湖的人都怕他。他对爹爹扯了包天大谎，说：“娶到刘家做媳妇，缺什么有什么”，“我舅子挑得起百多斤，是个好后生。”爹病在床上，只望我有个生路，没说话；娘没出过门，甚么也不知道；街坊邻居看见是保长做媒，也不敢多嘴。这样，就把生辰八字拿到刘家去了。过后，我一打听，知道刘天保是个歪嘴瘸脚的疯子，是个吃饭拿不住筷子、说起话来嘴朝天的人。我想我怎能嫁这样的丈夫呢？心都碎了！我不敢当着爹娘的面哭，怕爹娘伤心，就跑到田里哭，到山上哭。我说：“天哪！真有这样的恶事啊！”
    往后，我真是在滚油锅里过日子。打柴时想到刘天保那副样子，手都软了；作田时想到刘天保就是我的丈夫，心就发慌。十七岁那年，刘家来人说要择日子娶我，我急得不知道怎样好。我哭着向爹娘说：“嫁这样的人，我死也不去！”爹娘说：“闺女啊！千不好万不好，总是做父母的不好，既然许了人家，又有什么法子？”我不能怪爹和娘，又依不得爹和娘。我想：爹娘生我，望我成人，望我能替二老撑住门户，把弟弟带大；我肩上挑得，手里做得，不能那样软弱，应该自己出主意。我想了个办法，对刘家来的人说：“叔叔伯伯，还是您好言多借，和我婆家谈，我弟弟如今年纪小，出不得力，抵不得事，过两年等他大了，我放得下爹娘的心，再嫁去不迟！”刘家量我逃不出他们的手心，就答应下来，我的心才松下一把！
    但是，旧社会里，恶狗单咬破衣人，我顶住了刘家，又顶不住村里人的嘴。本村地主大眼炮的老婆王月英，向来眼珠里没别人，更不消说我们穷人。我刚回住了刘家的亲事，她的嘴就来了。她说：
    “把闺女留在家里弄柴拔草，赖得不嫁人，总要生
    ‘家外甥’（非婚生子）的！”有些不开通的人听她这么一说，也传着说我爹娘“真糊涂，一天到晚让闺女在外边干活，难免要出名堂”。我起先听到很烦恼；后来我想：我走得正，坐得稳，靠自己力气吃饭，有什么怕说的！索性左耳进，右耳出，让他们癞蛤蟆瞎叫，碍不上我徐赛娇半根头发。
    我苦挣苦撑，作田种地，风里来，雨里去，心里总巴望着弟弟快些长大，好养活爹和娘。可是一想到自己的事，心上就像吊着一块石头，放不下。一九四九年，我正愁着有朝一日刘家要来强娶我，解放军就过江来了！村上红旗一打开，穷苦人就算见了太阳。我喜得心花都开啦！我说：再不怕地主逼债，再不怕保长逼婚了！
    六月里，乡里组织农会，搞得很热闹，我当了妇女小组长。接上就划阶级，过了年接着就减租减息反恶霸。翻身炮打响了，受苦人真高兴！一九五○年五月间，区干部开会说：“毛主席颁布婚姻法啦！男女婚姻都要自主！”我一听到，喜上加喜，满肚子高兴跑回家里，想给爹爹说。爹爹却早拿话顶住我问：“赛娇，你当小组长，不是当女兵吧？”“共产党会不会搞一下就走呢？”他这么一问，又把我愁住了。我知道，老人家过去受够了人家的气，怕变天吃倒账，这也是难怪的。要是我不打通他的思想，工作做不好，婚约也莫想解除。我自己一时想不出好办法，便和工作同志商量。几个女同志都来帮忙，一次又一次串我家的门，打比方，算细账，搬事实，说共产党的好处。爹想到地主徐彦鲁逼债倒走我家的芝麻，想到地主大眼炮的儿子打我，又看到各村都来了土地改革工作队，要分田地啦，便说：“共产党真是好，天下长久啦！”这样，才对我放下心。我瞅着空子试他的口气，谈我解除婚约的事。起先他还是不答应，说：“一动又要得罪好多人！”我说：“地主恶霸都要打倒，怕什么！”他说：
    “恶人不要我们做。”我忍不住了，我说：“爹，我自己的事还是由我自己作主吧！”十一月里，我到乡政府提出和刘家解除婚约的事。乡里手续没办完，土地改革就开始了，我忙着发动群众斗争地主和丈田量地（我那时是村妇女代表、乡政府委员），退婚的事也就搁下了。到一九五一年三月，区政府给我作主，找到刘天保和我当面谈解除婚约的事。刘天保说：“徐赛娇说给我做老婆，她自己答应过弟弟大了就嫁给我的。要我解除婚约，说不过去！”我说：“你姐夫说你能挑得起百多斤，我当初不知道，今天你挑五十斤给我看看！挑得我就嫁你！”刘天保听我这么一说，慌了！急急呀呀的，半天对不上一句话。区长说：“算了吧！婚姻是不能强逼的，还是痛痛快快，把婚约一笔勾销吧！”刘天保
    “我……我……”的，还想“我……”什么名堂，区长说：“去吧！”我谢天谢地，心上一块石头放下来了。
    解除婚约的第二天，刘天保还不死心，拉拢了好多人赶到我家来，说要我拿二千六百斤谷子到刘家去取“八字”。我说：“没有！”刘家来的人拍着桌子说要办饭，要不就打破我家的锅！又有人喊着说：“不管三七二十一，吊她一索再说！”我跑到乡长家里，请乡长评理。乡长说：“到区里去！”区里说：“婚姻法明摆在这里，谁要拦阻，谁就犯错误！”刘家的人经不住驳，菜篮装黄鳅，就一个一个溜了。
    刘家一条烂索割断了，我一身都是劲，生产也欢心，爹娘也高兴，村里更把我的事当新鲜话传。有的说好，有的说歹。不管别人说好说歹，我自己是拿定了主意：一定不辜负共产党、毛主席的恩典，一定要做个好样子，一来为自己，二来也好给别人学个样。以后，我工作更积极，有空就生产，把田地耕作得更细。上门说亲的人也多起来了。本村有个刘桂花，想要我做媳妇，托媒说：“要是赛娇愿嫁我儿子，东西多少我不计较，三十石就三十石，五十石就五十石！”娘问我，我说：“又是包办，又是买卖，我不去！”清塘乡刘家也有人来说媒，说是“清塘乡出来的媳妇还得嫁清塘乡”。我说：
    “不是我自己选的对象我不要！”人家见我态度强硬，找我娘谈：“闺女结婚还是得父母作主！”我听到后，更生气，我说：“毛主席颁布的婚姻法，句句话不能打折扣，谁也管不了儿女的亲事！”这一下，娘和许多叽哩咕噜的人都缩了嘴，都说：“你选吧！”
    我选，当然要选。我一要选受苦的根底，成份好的；二要选劳动好，生产能干的；三要选思想进步的。我想：纵然选不到“三不缺”的对象，我也得帮助他做到这些。我们村对河麻棚里住的蔡志影，是个老实农民，过去受苦的时候，我到麻棚里山上抽竹笋，认识他，也知道他家过去苦寒，他跟娘帮人看山种庄田，先前还讨过饭。苦命人同翻身，根底子是一样，不要说爱他，就是谈谈，心也容易绞成一条哩！一九五一年十二月间，我们见了面，他碾米，我淘菜。起先还有些难为情，说半句，留半句。一个老公公走过来带笑说：“你两个人配成一对可真好！”我想：要说就索性说了吧！我问蔡志影能不能接受我几个意见。蔡志影说：“你提提看！”我说：“我们都是靠了毛主席才翻身的人，翻身不忘本，就该加劲生产，还要做好地方工作！”他说：“在道理！”接着我就把我的条件谈出来，并且告诉他，不要怕做不到，只要努力就行。最后我还郑重地加上一句说：“要是我们结婚，你就一定要保证不扯我的后腿，让我好好干工作！”他也一口气答应了下来。
    一九五二年三月里，我和蔡志影结了婚。我夫妻两人种田同进同出，有商有量。论种田，蔡志影的劳动好，就是计划差些。比方上半年割油菜时，他赶着忙地里的活，我说：“地里迟一步不要紧，油菜要先割，怕落雨呢！”他依了我的话，和我一道打了两担半油菜，担子一进屋，果真下了雨，一下下了七、八天。他说：“赛娇，这下真搞得好！下回我真要多和你盘算！”以后田里的活，我们都商量着办。做活的时候，我总瞅机会帮助蔡志影进步。我告诉他穷人翻身的道理，劝他不但要懂得当家作主，还要会当家作主。起先他怕婆婆扯后腿，民兵都不愿当。我说：“娘的思想还要靠我们打通呢，我们不要让她的旧思想拖住呀！”慢慢的，他也就要求进步了，不但生产上加紧，还争取做了基干民兵，并且入了青年团。最近，由于党的培养，又成了光荣的共产党候补党员！
    我的婆婆当我初进门时，思想上有两个累：一是怕我当干部耽误工夫，二是怕我带动丈夫参加工作，要调走。五月间，我夫妻俩打完麻回家时，婆婆说：“赛娇，你还是别出门，就在家里做做洗衣服做鞋的事吧。再说，土地改革完了，复查也完了，革命成功了，干部也别当了吧。我们乡里上千个妇女，还怕选不出个妇女代表会主任；两千多男人，还怕没人当民兵！”我听了停了一下，等她心静了，我开口说：“婆婆，先前我们都是吃够了苦的人，好容易托共产党、毛主席的福才有今天的好日子过，才打出个这样的好天下。我们穷人当家，自己不做干部，难道让地主做干部，又骑到我们头上来？”接着我又说：“咱们的事情还多哩，就拿我们这里恶霸地主蔡志贤的事打比吧：前些日子他逃亡在外，在河下贴字条子说自己投河死了，大家一天到晚捞不到，第三天却在石板桥把他捉住了。你看地主还不死心，我们若是松劲，饭碗还不算牢靠呢！”婆婆听我这么一劝，早年的苦水也翻上心来了。看她心里也痛苦，我急忙扭转说：“婆婆，我夫妻一定做到工作、生产两不误，你看下半年我们的好收成吧！”她说：“好！好！”真的，到八月里割禾的时候，我们家里八亩田就打了三十七石干谷，比头年多打三分之一，婆婆看看，嘴也笑开了！
    婆婆住在山沟里，起先开会都不愿出来听，如今是有会必到，懂了好多革命道理。人家看到她高兴，就跟她搭笑，问她过去为什么有些顽固？她说：“老糊涂了，不懂政策嘛！”有的问她为什么现在这样高兴，她说：“丢了讨饭棍，一年胜一年，儿子娶上好媳妇，都是干部，都是党员，媳妇还是模范，怎么能不高兴呢？”她指着毛主席的像说：“还不都是他老人家领导得好，才有今朝！”
