Vice Minister of Central Commerce Yao Yilin stated at a general meeting of directly affiliated organizations and professional general companies of the Ministry on January 23rd, reporting on the Ministry's anti-bureaucracy struggle and improvement of agency work over the past month. Yao Yilin emphasized: In order to deeply develop the anti-bureaucracy struggle, it is necessary to seriously handle the serious bureaucratic elements and law-breaking and discipline-violating elements exposed in the anti-bureaucracy struggle. He said that the incident of the Northeast Coal Construction Company shipping rotten wood through customs and the bureaucratic errors of the China Coal Construction General Company regarding this incident must be seriously handled. He also requested that more than 300,000 employees of the national state-owned commercial system discuss this incident.

Vice Minister Yao Yilin said: "Most of the problems exposed in the process of launching the anti-bureaucracy campaign and improving agency work within the Central Commerce Ministry over the past month can be resolved and improved through education, learning, and work. However, some serious bureaucratic elements and law-breaking and discipline-violating elements must be seriously dealt with (the purpose of handling them is also for education). The incident of the Northeast Coal Construction Company shipping rotten wood through customs is one of the typical examples that must be dealt with." He analyzed this incident, which has already attracted attention from all parties, saying: "The Northeast Coal Construction Company has serious departmentalism and capitalist business ideology. This is manifested in: failing to execute contracts, blindly increasing the timber yield rate without following national regulations, replacing building materials with rotten wood, and transporting bad materials mixed with good materials into the interior. Some coal construction companies in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places have also, under the influence of this capitalist business ideology, mixed the rotten materials shipped from the Northeast with good materials for sale, deceiving construction units, and causing losses to national basic construction and worker casualties. This bad practice of only caring about the interests of one's own unit and harming the overall interests of the country, deceiving user units, and deceiving consumers is absolutely intolerable. The China Coal Construction General Company has serious bureaucratic work styles. When it discovered the rotten wood shipped from the Northeast, it did not take effective measures to stop the Northeast Coal Construction Company's breach of contract, but only raised general objections; after the wood entered customs, it only issued general principle instructions such as 'superior materials, superior prices, bad materials, bad prices' and 'promoting the sale of off-grade materials,' without conducting in-depth typical investigations, analyzing and researching based on specific materials, or proposing definite and feasible handling methods. After the China Coal Construction General Company issued instructions, it did not conduct inspections or urge implementation, which allowed this bad practice to continue to develop." Yao Yilin said: The Central Commerce Ministry also has shortcomings, that is, it did not lead this work ideologically or politically, did not promptly point out the seriousness of the incident of shipping rotten wood through customs to the Northeast Trade Department and local commercial administrative departments, and did not propose a solution, nor did it conduct education among all employees in a timely manner. This is also a bureaucratic mistake.

He finally emphasized that the staff of the national state-owned commercial system must face up to the causes and consequences of the rotten wood import incident, accept this painful lesson, and wage a firm and unremitting struggle against all bureaucracy, departmentalism, law-breaking and discipline-violating phenomena, and the supply system and capitalist business ideology, improve their policy and ideological level, establish an overall concept, and strive to smoothly complete the national construction plan to the end.

    中央商业部姚依林副部长表示
    严肃处理东北煤建公司运朽木进关的事件
    中央商业部姚依林副部长一月二十三日在该部直属机关和各专业总公司全体职工大会上，报告中央商业部一个月来反官僚主义斗争和改进机关工作的情况。姚依林着重指出：为了深入展开反官僚主义斗争，必须严肃地处理在反官僚主义斗争中所揭发出来的严重的官僚主义分子及违法乱纪分子。他说，东北煤建公司运送腐朽木材进关的事件和中国煤建总公司对于这一事件的官僚主义错误，必须严肃处理。并要求全国国营商业系统三十余万职工讨论这个事件。
    姚依林副部长说：“中央商业部一个月来在机关内部开展的反对官僚主义、改进机关工作的过程中所揭发出来的问题，绝大部分是可以通过教育、学习和在工作中来解决和改进的。但有些严重的官僚主义分子与违法乱纪分子，必须严肃处理（处理的目的也是为了教育）。东北煤建公司运送腐朽木材进关事件，就是必须处理的典型事例之一。”他分析这个已经引起各方面注意的事件说：“东北煤建公司存在着严重的本位主义与资本主义经营思想。这表现在：既不执行合同，又不按国家的规定而盲目提高出材率，以腐朽木材换替建筑材，将坏材夹在好材中运进关内。北京、天津和其他有些地方的煤建公司，也由于这种资本主义经营思想作祟，将东北运来的腐朽材掺在好材内销售，欺骗建筑单位，造成国家基本建设的损失与工人伤亡事件。这种只顾本单位利益而危害国家整体利益，欺骗用货单位，欺骗消费者的恶劣作风，是决不能容忍的。中国煤建总公司存在着严重的官僚主义作风，发现了东北运来的腐朽木材，但对东北煤建公司的违反合同行为没有采取有效方法加以制止，只是提出一般的反对；当木材进关之后，仅提出了“优材优价，坏材坏价”及“推销等外材”的一般原则指示，没有进行深入的典型调查，根据具体材料分析研究，提出确切可行的处理办法。中国煤建总公司发出指示后又不进行检查，督促贯彻执行，致使这种恶劣作风得以继续发展。姚依林说：中央商业部方面也存在着缺点，这就是没有从思想上政策上领导这一工作，没有及时向前东北贸易部和各地商业行政部门指出运送朽木进关事件的严重性，并提出解决的方针，及时在全体职工中进行教育。这也是犯了官僚主义的错误。
    他最后强调全国国营商业系统工作人员，必须正视朽木进关事件的原因及后果，接受这一沉痛的教训，和一切官僚主义、本位主义、违法乱纪现象，和供给制及资本主义经营思想作坚决不懈的斗争，提高政策思想水平，树立整体观念，为顺利完成国家建设计划奋斗到底。
