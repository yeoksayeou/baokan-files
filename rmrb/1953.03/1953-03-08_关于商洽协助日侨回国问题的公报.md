    Public Communiqué on Negotiating Assistance for the Repatriation of Japanese Nationals

    In order to assist Japanese nationals in China who wish to return to their country, the delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society and the delegation composed of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee, and the Japan-China Friendship Association have conducted consultations in Beijing regarding ship procedures and various other specific issues. After several meetings, the two sides reached the following consensus:

    I. The Chinese side has determined that Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Shanghai will be the gathering and embarkation points for Japanese nationals who wish to return to their country.

    II. The deadline for the completion of the gathering and the commencement of embarkation of the first group of Japanese nationals wishing to return to their country is set from March 15th to March 20th, 1953. Japanese ships should arrive at the aforementioned three ports within this specified period.

    III. The number of people in the first group of Japanese nationals wishing to return to their country will be between 4,000 and 5,000.

    IV. After the first group of Japanese nationals wishing to return to their country departs from Chinese ports, the number of passengers and ships for each subsequent group of Japanese nationals wishing to return to their country shall be determined based on the number of Japanese nationals applying for repatriation and the ship situation. However, it can be roughly estimated that the interval between the gathering times for each group of Japanese nationals wishing to return to their country will be approximately 20 days, and the number of people in each group will be approximately 3,000 to 5,000.

    V. After the departure of the first group, the approximate number of people, embarkation date, tonnage, arrival port, and arrival date of the relevant ships for each subsequent group of Japanese nationals wishing to return to their country shall be notified by the Chinese Red Cross Society via telegram to the Liaison Office of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee and Japan-China Friendship Association.

    VI. Each time a Japanese ship arrives, the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee, and the Japan-China Friendship Association shall each send one person to accompany the ship to provide care, so as to maintain contact with the Chinese Red Cross Society and assist Japanese nationals wishing to return to their country.

    VII. Japanese ships shall comply with the "Regulations on Matters to be Observed by Japanese Ships Coming to Assist the Repatriation of Japanese Nationals" issued by the competent Chinese authorities.

    VIII. The deadline for the Chinese Red Cross Society to assist Japanese nationals wishing to return to their country in batches will be approximately the end of June to the beginning of July 1953.

    IX. In order to take care of Japanese nationals wishing to return to their country, the Chinese Red Cross Society will bear the cost of food, accommodation, travel expenses, and the transportation of baggage not exceeding 50 kilograms per person from the date they leave their residence until they board the ship.

    X. Japanese nationals wishing to return to their country must complete customs procedures for the items they carry and must not carry prohibited exports or contraband items stipulated by the Chinese government.

    XI. In order to assist Japanese nationals wishing to return to their country, the Chinese side allows them to apply to exchange a certain amount of foreign currency to take back to their country.

    XII. If there are still Japanese nationals who wish to return to Japan after the batch repatriation of Japanese nationals is completed, the Chinese Red Cross Society is willing to continue to provide assistance and will maintain contact with the Liaison Bureau of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee, and the Japan-China Friendship Association at any time.
