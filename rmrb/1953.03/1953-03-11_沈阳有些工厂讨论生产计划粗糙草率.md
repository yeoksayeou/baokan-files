In the machinery, electrical, chemical, textile, and light industry systems of Shenyang, half of the factories have begun mobilizing workers to discuss production plans. In some of these factories, leaders, eager to achieve quick results, have exhibited a tendency towards formalism, being crude, hasty, and failing to sufficiently mobilize the masses.

This tendency is manifested in:

I. Ideological mobilization work is not deep or thorough, and leading cadres do not understand the key problems in production. For example, the leading cadres of the Machinery No. 25 Factory did not study the documents well, nor did they analyze the potential of each workshop. They also did not systematically educate the workers about the three major tasks of the country this year. Leading cadres said, "We don't know how to discuss the national plan." Workers said, "What three major tasks? Isn't it just telling workers to work harder!" Under these circumstances, with cadres unsure and workers ideologically confused, the factory mobilized workers to discuss and finalize the first quarter's plan in five days. As a result, even the group plans that the factory considered to be the best discussed and formulated were very unspecific. They only had numerical requirements for output and quality, without concrete measures to ensure the implementation of the plan, let alone plans for learning from advanced experience. Now, the factory has to rework and mobilize workers to re-discuss. The Local State-owned Small Hardware Factory is the same. The leading cadres of this factory believed, "Just sending the plan to the workshop for the workers to know is enough." They didn't conduct ideological mobilization work either, and only published two issues of blackboard newspapers, considering that they had "delivered" the plan to the workshop. The Electrical Engineering No. 7 Factory started piloting and then rolled it out comprehensively, resulting in the pilot becoming a formality, and the "comprehensive" implementation was not good either. The Shenyang Gunny Sack Factory's plan was rushed through during the Spring Festival, very hastily. The quality did not meet the requirements, the equipment efficiency could not be fully utilized, and no solutions were found. Therefore, although the plan was finalized, there was not much confidence in how to complete it. In some factories in the chemical system, the content of group plans was vague. They even included participating in social activities and catching a certain number of mice and flies in the group guarantee plan, fully illustrating that the leadership was not clear about the key issues in production. In addition, many factories, when conducting ideological mobilization work, simply read from newspapers and documents without integrating it with the ideological situation of the workers in their own units. According to the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, there are still many concerns among workers. For example, they are afraid that finding shortcuts will lead to increased quotas and lower wages; afraid that formulating advanced plans will be tiring and burdensome, or be ridiculed by backward workers; feel that the light industry has no future, and there will be no work to do in the future; afraid that after formulating advanced plans, they will have to formulate increase production and practice economy plans, or face situations such as work stoppages and material shortages, or changes in tasks; some feel that they have already exhausted all the shortcuts last year. These ideological concerns are hindering workers from finding shortcuts, tapping potentials, and formulating advanced plans. Some factories have also conducted ideological surveys, but they are just formalities for the sake of surveys, without effectively solving these specific problems.

II. Not paying attention to the shortcuts found by workers. The Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions investigated ten workshops and found a total of 2,010 shortcuts, most of which were not handled in a timely manner. Some ideologically conservative cadres even refused to adopt the shortcuts found by workers. For example, Wang Tingxing, a worker at the State-owned Clothing No. 9 Factory, proposed during the plan discussion to use less hempseed oil and more caustic soda to make "Lao Du Oil," which could save the country 7 to 8 million yuan per month and ensure quality, but the technician and workshop director refused to adopt it (it was only adopted after the trade union raised objections). The Local State-owned No. 1 Glass Factory did not hold a single meeting of the rationalization proposal committee when mobilizing workers to find shortcuts, and only sent a technician to the workshop to take a look. Some factories did not mobilize workers to focus on finding shortcuts around the key issues in production, so the workers' creative enthusiasm could not be brought into greater play.

III. Not seriously organizing technical personnel and staff to go to the workshops to help workers find shortcuts, calculate detailed accounts, and formulate plans, and to improve the work of the departments in conjunction. According to a survey by the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, in 31 state-owned and local state-owned enterprises, except for five factories such as the Shenyang Smelting Plant, none had seriously organized technical personnel and staff to go to the workshops. The leading cadres of the Machinery No. 1 and No. 4 Factories believed that technical personnel and staff going to the workshops would hinder the work of the departments, and that since there were no increase production and practice economy tasks this year, there was no need to calculate accounts, and technical personnel and staff did not need to go to the workshops. Some factories, although they also mobilized technical personnel and staff to go to the workshops, did not specifically assign work content. For example, the Machinery No. 5 Factory established a technical personnel work team at the beginning of the plan discussion, and everyone was very enthusiastic. However, because the work tasks were not clear, they didn't know what to do after going down.

In addition, some factories lack a comprehensive planning concept, focusing only on quantity and neglecting quality and cost. For example, the output of the Electrical Engineering No. 5 Factory this year is less than last year according to the national plan. From the Party committee secretary down, the factory developed a relaxed attitude, thinking that it could be completed without effort and without mobilizing the masses to discuss. In fact, the quality of the factory's products is very low and must be improved, but the leadership does not pay attention to this issue. This one-sided view of tasks also needs to be corrected urgently.

### 沈阳有些工厂讨论生产计划粗糙草率

    沈阳有些工厂讨论生产计划粗糙草率
    沈阳市机械、电工、化学、纺织、轻工等产业系统中，已有半数工厂开始发动职工讨论生产计划。在这些工厂中，有一些单位由于领导干部急于求成，发生了粗糙草率、不充分发动群众的形式主义偏向。
    这种偏向表现在：
    一、思想动员工作做得不深不透，领导干部不了解生产中的关键问题。如机械二十五厂的领导干部就没有很好地学习文件，也没有分析各车间的潜力所在，对职工也没有系统地进行关于今年国家的三大任务的教育。领导干部说：“我们不知道怎样讨论国家计划。”工人说：“什么三大任务，还不是叫工人多干活呗！”该厂就在这种干部心里没底，工人思想混乱的情况下，发动职工在五天内讨论并订完了第一季度的计划。结果，即使是该厂认为讨论和制订得最好的小组计划，也是很不具体的，只有产量和质量的数字要求，没有保证实现计划的具体办法，更没有学习先进经验的计划。现在该厂只好返工，发动职工重新讨论。地方国营小五金厂也是这样，该厂的领导干部认为：“把计划发到车间让工人知道知道就算了。”也没有进行思想动员工作，仅仅出了两期黑板报，就算把计划“下达”到了车间。电工七厂刚开始试点就全面铺开，结果试点流于形式，“全面”进行得也不好。沈阳麻袋厂的计划是在春节赶订完的，草率得很，质量达不到要求，设备效率不能充分发挥，又没有想出办法来，因此计划虽然订完了但如何完成却把握不大。化工系统有的工厂，小组计划内容空泛，甚至把参加社会活动、捉多少只老鼠、多少只苍蝇也订在小组保证计划里，充分说明了领导上对生产中的关键问题是不明确的。此外，有不少工厂在进行思想动员工作时，只是照着报纸和文件念，没有和本单位职工的思想情况结合起来。据沈阳市总工会了解，目前工人中还存在着很多顾虑。如怕找窍门以后提高定额少得工资；怕订出先进计划后吃力受累，或受到落后工人的嘲骂；觉得轻工业没有前途，将来会没有活做；怕订出先进的计划以后，还要订增产节约计划，或者发生停工待料、变更任务等情况；有的觉得去年已经把窍门找绝了。这些思想顾虑都阻碍着工人们找窍门、挖潜力、制订先进的计划。有些工厂也进行了思想调查，但是形式地为调查局调查，没有切实解决这些具体问题。
    二、不重视职工找出的窍门。沈阳市总工会调查了十个车间，一共出现了两千零十个窍门，绝大部分没有及时处理，个别思想保守的干部，甚至拒绝采用工人找出的窍门。如国营被服九厂工人王廷兴在讨论计划时，提出少用大麻子油多用火碱做“老笃油”的建议，每月可给国家节省七百万到八百万元，并能保证质量，但技师和车间主任却拒绝采用（后经工会提出意见后才采用了）。地方国营第一玻璃厂在发动工人找窍门的时候，合理化建议委员会没有开过一次会，只派一个技术人员到车间去看了一看。还有些工厂没有发动职工着重围绕着生产中的关键问题找窍门，使职工的创造热情未能发挥更大的作用。
    三、没有认真组织技术人员和职员下车间帮助工人找窍门、算细账订计划，并结合着改进科室工作。据沈阳市总工会调查，在三十一个国营和地方国营企业中，除沈阳冶炼厂等五个工厂外，都没有认真组织技术人员和职员下车间。机械一厂和四厂的领导干部就认为技术人员职员下车间会妨碍科室工作，认为今年没有增产节约任务，不用算账了，技术人员和职员用不着下车间了。有的工厂虽然也发动技术人员和职员下车间，但没有具体布置工作内容，如机械五厂开始讨论计划时即成立了技术人员工作大队，大家情绪很高。但由于工作任务不明确，下去了以后不知道做什么。
    此外，还有些工厂缺乏全面的计划观念，只重数量，不重视质量和成本。如电工五厂今年的产量，根据国家计划的规定，比去年减少了，该厂从党委书记起就产生了松劲思想，认为不使劲就能完成，不用发动群众讨论。其实，该厂产品的质量很低，必须加以改进，而领导上对这一问题却不加重视。这种片面的任务观点也是亟需纠正的。
