    The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people are extremely anxious about Comrade Stalin's serious illness. When the announcement from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union about Comrade Stalin's illness arrived, our people nationwide felt sudden shock. However, the announcement proved it to be true. Now Comrade Stalin's condition remains extremely serious, which is a major misfortune not only for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, but also for the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, for the working class and all working people of the world, and for all peace-loving humanity.
    The serious condition of the health of Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world and the most beloved friend of the Chinese people, causes us constant anxiety. Our Party and our people are concerned about Comrade Stalin's condition every second, and sincerely hope that his condition will improve and he will regain his health. In his telegram of condolences on Comrade Stalin's illness, Chairman Mao Zedong said: "Upon learning the unfortunate news of your serious illness, the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and I myself, with the deepest concern, extend our sincere condolences to you, and sincerely hope that your condition will improve and you will regain your health, to the comfort of the wishes of the Chinese and peace-loving people of the world." This represents the infinitely deep wishes of our Party and the Chinese people. During this period, letters and telegrams from all corners of our country expressing condolences for Comrade Stalin's illness have been pouring in like snowflakes. This spiritual comfort is generating a powerful material force that will overcome the temporary difficulties caused by Comrade Stalin's serious illness.
    As stated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union in their announcement: "Due to Comrade Stalin's serious illness, he will inevitably be unable to participate in leadership activities for a period of time, whether long or short, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, like our entire Party and all our Soviet people, recognize the full significance of this fact." Our Party and the Chinese people share the same feeling as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, and we also recognize the full significance of all the circumstances caused by Comrade Stalin's serious illness. We believe that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, educated for a long time by the great Lenin and Comrade Stalin, are fully capable of skillfully handling all situations.
    The Central Committee of the Communist party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union announced: "The Central Committee and the Council of Ministers are confident that in these difficult days, our Party and all Soviet people will demonstrate the greatest unity and cohesion, a firm spirit and vigilance, and will redouble their efforts in our country's communist construction, and will unite more closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet government." Our Party and the Chinese people, like the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, deeply feel the great significance of uniting closely to overcome difficulties.
    In its telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union expressing concern for Comrade Stalin's illness, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China said: "During the difficult days of Comrade Stalin's serious illness, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also believes that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people will, with the greatest firmness, unite even more closely with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, heighten vigilance, and fight to the end for our common cause of defending world peace and security." This fully expresses the firm belief of our Party and the Chinese people. Our people have expressed their determination to respond to the call of our Party Central Committee.
    We deeply understand that the unbreakable unity between China and the Soviet Union is an infinite source of all our historical victories. Our Party educates our people to take the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, created and nurtured by Lenin and Stalin, and the Soviet people under its leadership as an example. We must cultivate the excellent qualities of unity, vigilance, and resolute struggle, and redouble our efforts to complete all arduous tasks of revolution and construction. Our Party and the Chinese people must always be with Lenin and Stalin's Party and the Soviet people, and make greater efforts to consolidate and develop the fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union, so that our two countries will unite more closely and strive for the permanent interests of our two peoples and the peace and security of the world.

    中苏两国人民更加亲密团结起来！
    中国共产党和中国人民因斯大林同志患了重病而感到极大的焦虑。当苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议宣告斯大林同志患病的公报传来的时候，我们全国人民都感到突然。然而，公报证明这是事实。现在斯大林同志的病况仍然极端严重，这不仅对于苏联共产党和苏联人民，而且对于中国共产党和中国人民，对于全世界的工人阶级和一切劳动人民，对于一切爱好和平的人类，都是重大的不幸事件。
    全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师、中国人民最敬爱的朋友斯大林同志的健康所遭遇的这种严重情况，使我们时时刻刻都在焦虑。我们的党和我国人民，每一秒钟都在关怀着斯大林同志的病况，衷心地盼望着他的病情好转，恢复健康。毛泽东主席在慰问斯大林同志病情的电文中说：“获悉您患重病的不幸消息，中国人民、中国政府和我本人怀着最关切的心情，向您谨致诚挚的慰问，并衷心地希望您的病情好转，恢复健康，以慰中国和全世界爱好和平人民的祝望。”这代表了我们的党和中国人民无限深切的企求。在这一段时间里，我国人民慰问斯大林同志病情的函电从各个角落像雪片一样飞来。这种精神上的慰问，正在产生出强大的物质力量，它将战胜因斯大林同志的重病而引起的暂时的困难。
    正如苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议的公报中所说的：“由于斯大林同志的严重疾病，他势必要在或长或短的时间内不能参加领导活动，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议，和我们全党以及我们全体苏维埃人民一样，都认识到这一事实的全部意义。”我们的党和中国人民，与苏联共产党和苏联人民有共同的感觉，我们同样认识到由于斯大林同志患了重病而引起的一切情况的全部意义。我们相信，受了伟大的列宁和斯大林同志长期教育的苏联共产党和苏联政府是完全能够熟练地处理一切情况的。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议的公报中说：“中央委员会和部长会议相信：在这些困难的日子里，我们的党和全体苏维埃人民一定会表现出最大的团结和一致、坚决的精神和警惕性，一定会加倍努力地从事我国的共产主义建设，一定会更加紧密地团结在共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围。”我们的党和中国人民，与苏联共产党和苏联人民一样，深切地感觉到紧密团结战胜困难的巨大意义。
    中国共产党中央委员会在致苏联共产党中央委员会问候斯大林同志病况的电文中说：“在斯大林同志重病期间的困难的日子里，中国共产党中央委员会同样相信：中国共产党和中国人民一定会以最大的坚定性，和苏联共产党及苏联人民更加紧密地团结一致，提高警惕，为我们保卫世界和平与安全的共同事业而奋斗到底。”这充分表达了我们的党和中国人民的坚强信念。我国人民都纷纷表示决心，响应我们党中央的号召。
    我们深切地了解，中苏两国牢不可破的团结，是我们取得一切历史性胜利的无限源泉。我们的党教育我国人民，要以列宁、斯大林所缔造培育起来的苏联共产党和它领导下的苏联人民为榜样，我们必须养成团结一致、提高警惕、坚决奋斗的优良品质，加倍努力完成一切革命和建设的艰巨任务。我们的党和中国人民，一定要和列宁、斯大林的党及苏联人民永远在一起，更加努力巩固与发展中苏两国兄弟般的友谊，使我们两国更加亲密团结，为我们两国人民的永久利益和全世界的和平与安全而奋斗。
