    Magazines Should Be Published Punctually on the Scheduled Date
    Recently, the phenomenon of magazines being published late has become serious, affecting readers' learning and increasing difficulties in printing and distribution.
    It is understood that from January of this year to the present, the magazines found to be published late include "Popular Cinema," "Literary Gazette," "Songs," "Defend Peace," "World Knowledge," "Study," "Study Junior Edition," "New China Women," "People's Education," "People's Pictorial," "Central Cooperative Communication," "China Light Industry," "Mathematics Bulletin," "Physics Bulletin," "Chemistry Bulletin," and "Biology Bulletin." The reasons for the delays include delays in reviewing manuscripts, difficulties in organizing manuscripts, problems in printing and binding, and, in a few cases, the impact of the Spring Festival holidays. Many of these reasons can be overcome, but these magazine publishers have not made their best efforts to overcome them. For example, "People's Pictorial" is often delayed by about ten days. The four magazines published by the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, "Mathematics Bulletin," "Physics Bulletin," "Chemistry Bulletin," and "Biology Bulletin," are also frequently unable to be published on time. The delay in the publication of these magazines prevents readers from obtaining necessary learning materials in a timely manner, reduces the political effect of the magazines, and causes great dissatisfaction among readers. It also affects the planned production of printing plants and the planned distribution of distribution departments. It is hoped that magazine publishers will strengthen their sense of time and publish on the scheduled publication date.

    杂志应按规定日期准时出版
    最近许多杂志脱期情形严重，影响读者的学习，并增加了印刷、发行上的困难。
    据了解，从今年一月起到目前止，已发现脱期的杂志有“大众电影”、“文艺报”、“歌曲”、“保卫和平”、“世界知识”、“学习”、“学习初级版”、“新中国妇女”、“人民教育”、“人民画报”、“中央合作通讯”、“中国轻工业”、“数学通报”、“物理通报”、“化学通报”“生物学通报”等。脱期的原因有的是因为审稿耽误了时间，有的是组织稿件发生了困难，有的是印刷、装订上的问题，有个别的是因受春节放假的影响。这许多原因很多都是可以克服的，但这些杂志社没有作最大的努力去克服。例如，“人民画报”经常脱期十天左右，中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会出版的“数学通报”、“物理通报”、“化学通报”、“生物学通报”四个杂志也经常不能按期出版，由于杂志的脱期，使得读者不能及时得到必要的学习资料，降低了杂志的政治效果，并引起读者很大的不满。同时也影响印刷厂的计划生产和发行部门的计划发行。希望杂志社加强时间观念，按规定出版日期出版。
