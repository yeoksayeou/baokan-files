    It Has Been Over Two Months Since This Newspaper Exposed the Fact That the Head of Guichi County Farm Falsely Reported High Yields.
    Why Has the Anhui Provincial People's Government Delayed Taking Action?
    According to a letter from correspondent Bao Dafu: The incident where Sun Tieyun, the head of the Guichi County Farm in Anhui Province, falsely reported achievements and fraudulently obtained the title of "Model Farm for High Yields" as reported by the People's Daily (see page 2, December 19th of last year), has been investigated by personnel sent by the Anhui Provincial People's Government and the Anqing Special Prefecture, proving the facts. However, it has been more than two months since this matter was exposed, and the Anhui Provincial People's Government and the Guichi County leadership have not announced the results of the handling of the matter to everyone. In mid-February of this year, I went to work in Guichi County and heard the reactions of many cadres to this incident. Some people said, "Probably the leadership is keeping it a secret, otherwise why not announce it?" Others said, "Sun Tieyun has been given a disciplinary warning within the Party and a demotion in administration." But Sun Tieyun is still the head of the farm and boastfully says, "After this case, the county leadership wanted to transfer me to the county to be the director of the cooperative, but I didn't want to. I must be the head of the farm." The general public in the farm all said, "Sun Tieyun is really well-connected."
    Let me first describe the process of how the leading organs here handled the matter after the People's Daily published this incident: In December 1952, I and two cadres from Anqing Special Prefecture who were specifically handling this case spoke with Sun Tieyun in person in Guichi County. A total of two meetings were held, each presided over by Song Yuxiu, the head of Guichi County, with the participation of responsible cadres from the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Guichi County Committee of the Communist Party of China and all cadres from the Guichi County Farm. At the first meeting, I first read the letter I had reported to the People's Daily. Except for the fact that the inspection by the East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry to the Guichi County Farm was not entirely factual, there were no objections to the rest of the letter. After reading the letter, the farm cadres spoke one after another, providing a lot of testimony and material evidence to prove that Sun Tieyun's false reporting of high-yield achievements was completely planned. For example, in early September of last year, after Sun Tieyun and Xu Naiqing falsely reported their achievements at a meeting of farms in the Anqing Special Zone, they immediately wrote a letter back to the farm, asking everyone to maintain the false achievements they reported in Anqing, and asking everyone to measure the fields in order to avoid being caught off guard when the superiors came to inspect. Sun Tieyun initially pretended not to know about this, but finally, in the face of ironclad facts, he had to admit that the figure of 1,500 jin per mu harvested from the high-yield fields of one mu and one fen and six li of the whole farm was fabricated by him. (It should be explained here: The previous report stated that the entire farm had 24 mu and 6 fen of cultivated land, with an average yield of over 1,200 jin of rice per mu, and the highest-yielding field was one mu and six li, with an average yield of 1,660 jin per mu. This was the figure before the land was measured, and the Guichi County People's Government awarded the prize based on this figure. Later, when Guichi County reported the award to the higher authorities, it was changed to the whole farm having 26 mu, 3 fen and 2 li of land, with an average yield of over 1,100 jin per mu, and the highest-yielding field was one mu, one fen and six li, with an average yield of 1,500 jin per mu. But both figures are false.) Finally, Sun Tieyun knew that he could not cover up his mistakes by any means, and he would inevitably be punished, so he burst into tears after the meeting, saying repeatedly: "I regret not listening to Xu Naiqing's words. Xu Naiqing stabbed me." Why did they fabricate the results? According to Xu Naiqing's self-criticism, "Because the Guichi County Farm has always been very backward, and the yield has not been high for many years, I wanted to become famous in one fell swoop." Sun Tieyun also admitted at the meeting that "I made a big mistake in the 'Three-Anti's campaign, and I was afraid of being punished again," so he decided to be a false model.
    Why has the Guichi County leadership delayed dealing with this matter? According to my understanding, this is because Sun Tieyun and some leading cadres in Guichi County are old fellow villagers and old colleagues. These leading cadres have protected him without principle, which has fueled his mistakes. I remember that before this matter was exposed, I reported it to Yang Fengming, the head of the Construction Section of Guichi County. At first, he didn't believe it, but finally he found Liu Jianbin, a technical cadre from the county farm, who confirmed it. After the Guichi County People's Government found out the facts, it ordered Sun Tieyun to make a self-criticism to the County People's Government. However, Sun Tieyun not only refused to conduct a thorough self-criticism, but also claimed to be "wronged," turned a deaf ear, and threatened Shi Liangsi, a technical cadre from the county farm, in every possible way in the Guichi County People's Government, preventing him from explaining the truth about the facts. The responsible cadres of the Guichi County People's Government did not stop his behavior, but only allowed him to perfunctorily make a self-criticism. After this meeting to verify the facts, Sun Tieyun asked Li Shaoji, the secretary of the Guichi County Party Committee, for help when he returned from the countryside. When he returned to the farm, he said to the cadres, "Secretary Li said I'm okay, Bao Dafu will definitely be punished." After we returned to Anqing from Guichi County, Sun Tieyun was afraid that the higher authorities would send someone to investigate again, so he suggested to the Guichi County People's Government to transfer all the administrative and technical cadres who knew the actual situation of this matter out of the county farm, in order to eliminate the evidence and cover up his own mistakes. And the Guichi County People's Government, regardless of the needs of the farm work, transferred all the technical personnel and administrative cadres who knew about this matter back to the county to be mobile cadres (some have been transferred elsewhere), leaving only Xu Naiqing to do technical guidance work. This will not only cause great losses to the farm work, but also eliminate the evidence for Sun Tieyun.
    Sun Tieyun has always adopted a patriarchal leadership style in the Guichi County Farm, and usually only relies on technical cadre Xu Naiqing and administrative cadre Zheng Chengzhong to handle affairs. Xu Naiqing relied on Sun Tieyun's power and had a physical relationship with the married accountant Wang Shufang. When someone suggested that Sun Tieyun pay attention, Sun said, "Whoever says this is provoking discord." Later, Xu Naiqing was caught by the workers, and Sun Tieyun said, "There is no crime in adultery, you (referring to the workers) are committing a big crime by catching adultery." Zheng Chengzhong relied on Sun Tieyun's power to often scold the workers and oppose the workers learning culture, believing that workers who knew a lot of characters could not work. When workers were sick, he also said they were pretending and forced them to work. Agricultural worker Zhang Mingcang said: "I was often hit when I was on the farm, and I suffered because I knew too many characters." The farm workers reported this situation to the cadres sent by the Anqing Special Prefecture, and asked someone to submit some opinions in writing to the County People's Government. Sun Tieyun said: "There are political activities on the farm." Yang Fengming, the head of the Construction Section of the Guichi County People's Government, said: "The workers are now suing Zheng Chengzhong, and they will sue Director Sun in the future." After Sun Tieyun reported the situation to the Guichi County People's Government and returned to the farm, on the one hand, he threatened the workers, saying: "Whoever provokes trouble will suffer, whoever provokes discord will be expelled." On the other hand, he secretly arranged an investigation. Later, it was found that the person who reflected the situation was Wang Daogen, an agricultural worker who was active in work and study on weekdays. He falsely accused Wang Daogen of being a big traitor in the past with a complicated history, and that this activity had political problems (in fact, Wang Daogen was from a peasant family and was conscripted by the enemy in the past and served as a soldier for a very short time), and he must be expelled. Due to these reasons, many farm workers wanted to leave the farm, and their work enthusiasm was extremely low.

    本报揭发贵池县农场场长虚报丰产事实已两月多了
    安徽省人民政府为何迟迟不作处理
    据通讯员包达夫来信反映：人民日报发表的安徽省贵池县农场场长孙铁云虚报成绩骗取“丰产模范农场”称号的事件（见本报去年十二月十九日二版），已经安徽省人民政府、安庆专署派人调查，证明属实。但这件事情揭露以后，到现在已有两个多月，安徽省人民政府和贵池县领导机关还没有向大家宣布处理结果。今年二月中旬我到贵池县工作，听到许多干部对这事件的反映。有人说“大概领导方面是保守秘密，不然为什么不宣布？”也有人说：“孙铁云在党内受了留党察看处分，在行政上受了撤职处分。”但孙铁云还在农场当场长，并且耀武扬威地说：“此案发生后，县领导方面要把我调到县里当合作社主任，我不愿干，我一定要干农场场长。”场内一般群众听了都说：“孙铁云真吃得开。”
    让我先把人民日报发表这一事件后这里领导机关处理的经过叙述一下：一九五二年十二月，我曾和安庆专署所派专办此案的两个干部到贵池县和孙铁云当面谈过。当时一共开了两次会，每次会都是由贵池县县长宋玉秀主持，并有中共贵池县委员会纪律检查委员会负责干部及贵池县农场全体干部参加。在第一次会议上，我先把我向人民日报检举的信读了一遍。除华东农林部派人到贵池县农场检查一点不符事实外，对其余部分没有意见。读了信后，农场干部纷纷发言，对检举信提出了很多人证物证，证明孙铁云假报丰产成绩完全是有计划干的。如去年九月上旬，孙铁云、徐乃清在安庆专区农场开会时假报成绩后，立即写信回场，要大家维持他们在安庆汇报的假成绩，并叫大家把田量一量，以免上级来检查时措手不及。孙铁云开始假装不知道这事，最后在铁的事实面前，不得不承认全场一亩一分六厘高额丰产田每亩收获一千五百斤的数字是他假造的。（在这里要说明：前次报道全场有耕地二十四亩六分，每亩平均产稻一千二百多斤，最高丰产田一亩零六厘，每亩平均产一千六百六十斤，系量田以前的数字，贵池县人民政府是根据这个数字奖励的。以后贵池县向上级报奖时，改为全场有耕地二十六亩三分二厘田，每亩平均产一千一百余斤，最高丰产田一亩一分六，每亩平均产一千五百斤。但两个数字都是假的。）最后，孙铁云知道用什么办法也掩盖不住他自己的错误，免不了要受处分，就在会后放声大哭，口口声声说：“悔不该听信徐乃清之言，徐乃清杀了我一刀。”他们为什么要作假呢？据徐乃清检讨说：“因为贵池县农场一向很落后，年年产量不高，想借此一举成名。”孙铁云在会议上也承认“自己在‘三反’中犯了很大的错误，怕再受一次处分”，因此就决心要当个假模范。
    贵池县领导机关为什么对此事迟迟不处理呢？据我了解这是因为孙铁云和贵池县某些领导干部是老同乡、老同事，这些领导干部无原则地袒护他，助长了他的错误。记得这事在未被揭发前，我曾向贵池县建设科科长杨凤鸣反映过，开始他不相信，最后他把县农场技术干部刘建斌找去，才证实了。贵池县人民政府查明事实后，即令孙铁云等到县人民政府检讨。可是孙铁云不但不肯深入检查，反而口称“冤枉”，装聋作哑，并在贵池县人民政府内，对县农场技术干部施亮思百般威胁，阻止他说明事实真象。贵池县人民政府负责干部对他的这种行为也不加以制止，只让他敷衍检讨了事。这次开会对证事实后，中共贵池县委书记李绍基同志下乡回来，孙铁云即向李求援。他回到农场，又向干部们说：“李县委说我没关系，包达夫一定要受处分。”我们由贵池县回到安庆后，孙铁云怕上级再派人来调查，竟建议贵池县人民政府把凡是知道这件事实际情况的行政和技术干部调出县农场，以便消灭人证物证，掩盖他自己的错误。而贵池县人民政府竟不顾农场工作需要，把知道这件事的技术人员和行政干部都调回县里做机动干部（有的已另调他处），仅留徐乃清做技术指导工作。这不但要使农场工作蒙受很大的损失，同时也替孙铁云消灭了人证物证。
    孙铁云在贵池县农场，一贯是采用家长式的领导，平时只依靠技术干部徐乃清和行政干部郑诚忠办事。徐乃清依赖孙铁云的势力，和有夫之妇的会计汪淑芳发生了肉体关系。当有人建议孙铁云注意时，孙竟说：“谁讲这个话，谁就是挑拨离间。”后来徐乃清被工人捉获，孙铁云又说：“通奸的没罪，你们（指工人）捉奸的犯大罪。”郑诚忠依靠孙铁云的势力，时常辱骂工人，反对工人学习文化，认为识字多的工人就不能劳动。工人有病，还说是假装的，强迫劳动。农业工人张明仓说：“我在农场时常受打击，就是吃了识字多的亏。”农场工人向安庆专署派来的干部反映这种情况，并请人向县人民政府用书面提了一些意见。孙铁云竟说：“农场里有政治活动。”贵池县人民政府建设科长杨凤鸣竟说：“工人现在告郑诚忠，将来还要告孙场长。”孙铁云向贵池县人民政府报告情况回场后，一方面威胁工人说：“谁挑皮谁吃亏，谁挑拨是非就开除谁。”一方面秘密布置调查。后来查出反映情况的是平日工作、学习积极的农业工人汪道根。他就诬称汪道根过去当过大汉奸，历史复杂，这次活动有政治问题（其实汪道根是农民出身，过去被敌人抓壮丁，当了很短时间的兵），一定要开除。由于这些原因，许多农场工人都想离开农场，工作情绪极低。
