    The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Disciplinary Inspection Commission Makes Decision
    Expel Anti-Party Element Wang Zhenhai from the Party
    [This Newspaper] The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Disciplinary Inspection Commission has completed its handling of the illegal and undisciplined behavior of former Dingxian Prefectural Committee Secretary Wang Zhenhai (see page 3 of this newspaper, January 19th) and made a "Decision on the Criminal Case of Anti-Party Element and Former Dingxian Prefectural Committee Secretary Wang Zhenhai" on March 4th, which has been approved by the CCP Central Committee. The full text of the decision is as follows:
    Wang Zhenhai, the former secretary of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee in Hebei Province, in order to achieve the goal of personal revenge, used his power to conspire to frame Communist Party member Li Xiaoliu in a serious incident. After a long period of multifaceted verification and investigation, the truth has been revealed, and Wang Zhenhai's anti-Party crimes have been fully confirmed.
    Li Xiaoliu (also known as Li Ying) is from Dongniu Village, Wuji County, Hebei Province, and a member of the Communist Party. After the Japanese "May 1st" sweep in 1942, Li Xiaoliu was dispatched by our side to work as an intelligence officer in the Zhengding puppet security army and achieved certain results. During the land reform in 1947, Li actively led the peasants in his village to wage a resolute struggle against feudal forces. The struggle had touched upon the personal interests of Wang Zhenhai's wife, Zhang Ying, and her family, which aroused hatred from Zhang Ying's side.
    Zhang Ying (Communist Party member, then serving as the Organization Committee Member of the Chengguan District Committee of Anguo County)'s family was a large landlord in Dongniu Village, owning more than 200 mu of land in the past, but was reduced to a middle peasant status after 1933. Since Zhang Ying joined the revolution, her selfish and self-interested thinking has not been transformed. In 1946, Zhang Ying received a portion of land from her mother's family and wrote the names of Wang Zhenhai and her two children on her mother's family's burden register to reduce the burden on the country. During the land reform in 1948, Wang Zhenhai's family (Wang, Zhang, and their children) was also allocated land and housing for five people. In the land reform in her village, Zhang Ying not only did not support the peasant struggle, but also interfered with the land reform and shielded her family. In 1947, during the land reform review, when Zhang Ying heard that two packages hidden by her family out of fear of struggle had been seized by the poor peasant group, she used the excuse that these were her packages, personally took them back from the poor peasant group, and falsely accused the packages of being short of items. For this, the poor peasant group ordered her to make a public self-criticism at a mass meeting. Afterwards, Zhang Ying said that this was more embarrassing than being slapped a few times, and she was very unwilling to accept it. During the review, the masses also liquidated and struggled against Zhang Ying's uncle (who had embezzled funds while serving as secretary to the puppet security chief). In the spring of 1948, because the masses did not understand the policy at the time, they also classified Zhang Ying's family as bankrupt landlords using the method of "checking three generations," and detained Zhang Ying's father, Li Baixue, for more than ten days, and planned to demolish the three brick houses Zhang Ying had received in her mother's family. At this time, Zhang Ying returned home for more than ten days and directly interfered with the land reform review work of the peasants, which aroused great dissatisfaction among district and village cadres. After the county committee raised its opinion, Zhang Ying was forced to leave. Since then, Zhang Ying has harbored resentment towards Li Xiaoliu and actively instigated her husband, Wang Zhenhai, to use his power to retaliate and frame Li Xiaoliu.
    In order to achieve the goal of revenge and frame-up, and to cleverly cover up this criminal purpose, Wang Zhenhai and Zhang Ying first used the fact that Li Xiaoliu had served as an intelligence officer in the puppet security army to fabricate various "crimes" against Li Xiaoliu. In August 1948, Wang Zhenhai personally went to Wuji County and introduced Li Xiaoliu's so-called "evil deeds" to Zhou Hongyi and Zhang Jishi, members of the county committee at the time, falsely accusing Li Xiaoliu, a Communist Party member who had been sent by our side to work as an intelligence officer in the puppet security army, as a "defected cadre," saying that "Li caused great harm to the people when he served as the director of the intelligence office in the Zhengding puppet security army, our work could not get in, and he killed our district committee secretary" (meaning that Zhang Ying's brother, district committee secretary Li Shuoyan, was killed by Li Xiaoliu, while the fact is that Li Shuoyan was betrayed to the enemy by the traitor Wang Ronggui and had nothing to do with Li Xiaoliu), and falsely claimed that "the Gaowu County Committee had decided to treat Li Xiaoliu as a 'single-strike' target." This was not the case. Zhang Ying also introduced Li Xiaoliu's "situation" to the Wuji County Committee in January 1949 and April 1950, falsely accusing Li Xiaoliu, who was actively working in the village, as a "bad element who controls the power in the village, specializes in sectarianism and disharmony," saying that Li Xiaoliu was "black-handed" (meaning assassination). Wang Zhenhai also reversed the poverty and wealth situation of Dongniu Village: Dongniu Village was clearly rich in the east and poor in the west, but he insisted to the county committee that the east was poor (his father-in-law Li Baixue lived in the east) and the west was rich (Li Xiaoliu lived in the west). Based on these facts that he had fabricated, Wang Zhenhai instructed the Wuji County Committee in August 1948 to expel Li Xiaoliu from the Party and dismiss him from his position as village chief. At that time, the Wuji County Committee blindly carried out Wang Zhenhai's wrong instructions and announced the expulsion of Li Xiaoliu from the Party, but because the district committee and village branch raised different opinions, Li Xiaoliu still participated in the Party's organizational life after returning to the village. Upon hearing this, Wang Zhenhai, together with Zhang Ying, instructed Jin Yangxian, a member of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee, to handle the matter in January 1949. Jin Yangxian urged the Wuji County Committee to expel Li Xiaoliu from the Party. Wang Zhenhai also publicly criticized the Wuji County Committee for not effectively implementing his instructions at a cadre meeting convened by the prefectural committee. At this point, the Wuji County Committee sent someone to Dongniu Village in August 1949 to expel Li Xiaoliu from the Party, suggested that the government remove Li from his position as village chief, and arrested Li Xiaoliu for the first time in March 1950. Because Li Xiaoliu had gone to the Hebei Provincial Military Region to find Comrade Niu Zhen (Chief of the Reconnaissance Section of the Hebei Military Region), who had sent him to do intelligence work, and Niu had written a letter of certification to Zhao Shuguang, Commissioner of the Dingxian Special District, and Liao Dinglin, Commander of the Military Sub-district, the Wuji County was notified to release Li Xiaoliu.
    At this time, the Dingxian Prefectural Committee realized Wang Zhenhai and Zhang Ying's criminal collusion. Comrade Liao Dinglin, Commander of the former Dingxian Military Sub-district, pointed out at the Prefectural Committee meeting that Li Xiaoliu's service as an intelligence officer in the puppet security army was dispatched by our side and was evidenced by Niu Zhen's letter to Commissioner Zhao Shuguang and himself, and that Zhang Ying's actions were personal revenge. However, the Prefectural Committee neither reported this serious anti-Party behavior of Wang Zhenhai and Zhang Ying to the Provincial Committee, nor launched a correct struggle against Wang Zhenhai, but adopted an intolerable corrupt liberalism, which in effect condoned Wang Zhenhai's criminal actions. After this, Wang Zhenhai changed his tactics and continued his conspiracy: on the one hand, he turned a deaf ear to the fundamental fact that Li Xiaoliu's service as an intelligence officer in the puppet security army was dispatched by our side and had been proven by responsible comrades, pretending not to believe it; on the other hand, in action, he changed his previous method of publicly fabricating and publicizing Li Xiaoliu's "crimes" to a method of deceiving the County Committee and concealing from the Prefectural Committee and the Provincial Committee, taking advantage of the opportunity of the campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries in April 1951 to further attempt to put Li Xiaoliu to death. At that time, Wang Zhenhai personally went to Wuji County and instructed the County Committee to treat Li Xiaoliu as a counter-revolutionary, concealing this from the Prefectural Committee. It is worth noting that when Wang Zhenhai introduced Li Xiaoliu's "situation" to the Wuji County Committee this time, he still did not mention the very important fact that Li Xiaoliu's service as an intelligence officer for the enemy was dispatched by our side. Before Wang Zhenhai's trip, the Wuji County Committee had neither discovered any blood debts of Li Xiaoliu, nor received any accusations from the masses, so Li Xiaoliu's name was not included in the list of counter-revolutionaries to be arrested in the first and second batches. After Wang Zhenhai's instructions, the Wuji County Committee blindly based on the "crimes" introduced by Wang Zhenhai and included Li Xiaoliu in the list of counter-revolutionary criminals sentenced to death with a reprieve, and submitted it to the Prefectural Committee for approval in May. Wang Zhenhai personally reviewed Li Xiaoliu's case file and personally carried a batch of case files to Hebei Province on June 2, 1951 (including Li Xiaoliu). When reporting the case, he also concealed the fact that Li Xiaoliu's service as an intelligence officer was dispatched by our side, and thus obtained the approval of the province (approval for arrest, to be confirmed after interrogation). As a result, Li Xiaoliu was arrested for the second time on July 2 of the same year. After Li Xiaoliu was arrested, Wang Zhenhai personally went to Wuji County again at the end of July to urge the Wuji County Committee to investigate and collect Li Xiaoliu's criminal materials. Although Zhang Ying's sister-in-law (wife of Li Shuoyan) and others made false accusations, no criminal facts of Li Xiaoliu were found in the end. As late as May 1952, Li Xiaoliu was released on bail, having been wrongly imprisoned for ten months.
    In August 1951, Fan Wenxing, Deputy Secretary of the former Dingxian Prefectural Committee, reported this incident to the Hebei Provincial Committee, but the Hebei Provincial Committee did not send anyone to thoroughly investigate such a major case, nor did it order the Dingxian Prefectural Committee to be responsible for finding out the truth. Instead, it mistakenly wrote a letter to Wang Zhenhai himself, ordering him to make a self-criticism. Wang Zhenhai not only did not make any self-criticism, but openly pursued the whistleblower, scolding Fan Wenxing and declaring that he would "go to the Central Committee and the North China Bureau to file a lawsuit" against Fan Wenxing, attempting to suppress Comrade Fan Wenxing, who upheld justice. At that time, most members of the Prefectural Committee adopted an unprincipled attitude towards Wang Zhenhai's behavior of disregarding Party discipline and state laws, and even Prefectural Committee member Shen Xiangshan criticized Fan Wenxing for not reflecting the problem to the Provincial Committee through the organization at a group meeting of the Party Committee in October 1951, saying that it "would greatly affect the unity between cadres," and extremely wrongly questioned Fan Wenxing's motivation for reflecting the problem, asking "whether he had a sense of position." Except for Deputy Commissioner Ji Shixin, other members of the Prefectural Committee, such as Lin Dayu and Zhao Shuguang, did not express any opposition to Shen Xiangshan's absurd remarks. At the end of October, the Prefectural Committee sent Commissioner Zhao Shuguang and Organization Minister Li Guoqing to Wuji County to investigate the case. Although the investigation confirmed that "Li Xiaoliu was innocent, Zhang Ying harbored a grudge against Li Xiaoliu for revenge, and Wang Zhenhai's persecution of Li Xiaoliu was instigated by Zhang Ying," the Prefectural Committee did not uphold the truth simply because Wang Zhenhai and Zhang Ying denied it, and wrote a false report to the Provincial Committee in November that confused the facts and covered up Wang Zhenhai's mistakes. The Provincial Committee also believed this false report and did not take any necessary measures. This once again condoned Wang Zhenhai's criminal behavior, giving him room to persist in his mistakes. Two months after Li Xiaoliu was declared innocent and released, Wang Zhenhai and Zhang Ying even privately wrote three letters to Liu Xue, the former enemy work minister of the Wuji County Committee, and other enemy work personnel, instructing them to provide Li Xiaoliu's so-called "criminal facts," attempting to resist to the end.
    In March 1952, Comrade Fan Wenxing reported this incident to the Hebei Provincial Committee again, and the Hebei Provincial Committee Disciplinary Inspection Commission sent someone to the Dingxian Prefectural Committee for investigation. Although the results of this investigation more thoroughly confirmed the criminal behavior of Wang Zhenhai and Zhang Ying, the Prefectural Committee still unprincipledly used the excuse that the case was complicated and pushed the case to the Provincial Committee. The Hebei Provincial Committee also adopted a bureaucratic attitude on this issue, using the excuse that the case was complicated and difficult to clarify for a while, and mistakenly adopted the method of "concluding the case with a written guarantee," believing that Wang Zhenhai mainly committed the error of "subjectivism," and only gave him a public warning, hastily closing the case. It was not until this time that the North China Bureau Disciplinary Inspection Commission convened more than 20 relevant cadres from the Hebei Provincial Committee Disciplinary Inspection Commission, the Dingxian Prefectural Committee, and the former Wuji County Committee, and jointly conducted repeated verification and investigation, that Wang Zhenhai's above-mentioned anti-Party crimes were completely exposed and verified one by one.
    All the above facts show that Wang Zhenhai and Zhang Ying, starting from extreme individualism, selfishness, and self-interest, betrayed the interests of the Party and the people, completely stood on the anti-Party and anti-people position, relied on their power to retaliate and frame revolutionary comrades. In order to achieve this criminal goal, Wang Zhenhai and Zhang Ying used the excuse that Li Xiaoliu had served as an intelligence officer in the puppet security army and did not hesitate to fabricate various facts, confuse right and wrong, and reverse black and white, forcibly adding the crime of counter-revolution to Li Xiaoliu. Wang Zhenhai did not raise Li Xiaoliu's issue before the land reform but insisted on raising it after the land reform, and when Li Xiaoliu's dispatch relationship had been proven by responsible personnel, Wang Zhenhai continued to turn a deaf ear to this issue, and dared not go through the proper organizational procedures in actual handling, but implemented the method of concealing from superiors and deceiving subordinates. All of this was to achieve the above-mentioned criminal goal. It can be seen that Wang Zhenhai has completely degenerated to the point of being anti-Party and anti-people, and is an incurable element. The serious unprincipled and liberalistic errors of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee (except for individual comrades) in handling this case, as well as the bureaucratic attitude of the Hebei Provincial Committee in dealing with this issue, condoned the development of this incident and should therefore bear certain political responsibility.
    Based on the above facts and the serious nature of the case, in order to strictly enforce Party discipline and educate the whole Party, the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Disciplinary Inspection Commission has decided to take the following actions against the relevant personnel and organizations:
    (1) Penalties for Individuals and Organizations
    Wang Zhenhai disregards Party discipline and state laws, completely starting from extreme individualism, selfishness, and self-interest, using his power to retaliate and frame revolutionary comrades, and attempting to persist in his mistakes to the end. It has been proven that he is an incurable anti-Party and anti-people element. It is decided to expel him from the Party and suggest that the government handle him according to law.
    Zhang Ying, currently a cadre of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee Disciplinary Inspection Commission, is an active instigator and participant in the Wang Zhenhai incident. She also shielded her family in the land reform, interfered with the land reform, and illegally occupied the fruits of the peasant struggle. She has completely lost the conditions of a Communist Party member. It is decided to expel her from the Party, suggest that the government handle her according to law, and recover the illegally occupied land.
    Zhao Shuguang, former Commissioner of the Dingxian Special District, member of the Standing Committee of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee, and currently Director of the Grain Bureau of the Hebei Provincial People's Government. In the Wang Zhenhai incident, he did not adhere to the Party's principles and bears significant responsibility for condoning Wang Zhenhai's mistakes. Although Zhao had heard Liao Dinglin introduce Li Xiaoliu's dispatch relationship and Zhang Ying's retaliatory behavior against Li Xiaoliu at the Prefectural Committee meeting, and had personally received Niu Zhen's letter of certification regarding Li Xiaoliu's dispatch relationship, he still treated this serious issue with a corrupt liberalistic attitude and did not launch a resolute struggle against Wang Zhenhai. In October 1951, when Zhao and Li Guoqing (Minister of the Organization Department of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee) went to Wuji County to investigate the incident, they ignored the correct opinion of the County Committee regarding the release of Li Xiaoliu, and intentionally made a false report to the Provincial Committee after the investigation. When the Prefectural Committee discussed the handling of Wang Zhenhai's issue in July 1952, he even vulgarly regarded such a major issue as "Fan Wenxing's personal prejudice against Wang Zhenhai" from the perspective of personal gains and losses, and advocated not giving Wang Zhenhai a penalty. His mistake is serious. It is decided to give him a demotion.
    Li Guoqing, former Minister of the Organization Department of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee (member of the Standing Committee), and currently First Deputy Secretary of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee. In this incident, Li unprincipledly regarded Fan Wenxing's righteous action of reporting Wang Zhenhai as a personal grudge and adopted a conciliatory and liberalistic attitude, starting from the so-called "maintaining the relationship between the two and not affecting work." Therefore, after investigating in Wuji County with Zhao Shuguang in 1951, although the matter had been largely clarified, he still intentionally deceived the Provincial Committee and made a false report to the Provincial Committee. It is decided to give him a demotion.
    Lin Dayu, former Secretary-General of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee and currently Second Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee. In this case, he did not adhere to the Party's principles, harbored personal prejudice against Fan Wenxing, and defended Wang Zhenhai's anti-Party behavior. It is decided to give him a public warning. As for Lin Dayu's other errors in his work, they will be investigated by the Hebei Provincial Committee and handled separately.
    Shen Xiangshan, former Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee and currently Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Committee. In this incident, Shen did not adhere to the Party's principles, did not launch a struggle against the anti-Party element Wang Zhenhai, but wrongly criticized Fan Wenxing for not reflecting the problem through the organization, saying that it "would greatly affect the unity between cadres." It is decided to give him a public warning.
    Li Tai (former Deputy Secretary of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee, currently Deputy Manager of the Directly Subordinate Engineering Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry) and Jin Yangxian (former Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Prefectural Committee, currently Deputy Director of the Commercial Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government) did not adhere to the Party's principles in the Wang Zhenhai incident, and did not launch a struggle against Wang Zhenhai after the facts had been largely clarified. It is decided to give them a public warning.
    Ji Shixin (former Deputy Commissioner of the Dingxian Special District, currently Commissioner), Wang Shunan (former Director of the Political Department of the Dingxian Military Sub-district, currently Director of the Political Department of the Tangshan Military Sub-district), and Li Qinglin (former Director of the Dingxian Special District Cooperative) showed apathetic attitudes in this incident and should all make profound self-criticisms.
    The Dingxian Prefectural Committee showed a serious loss of Party principles in the Wang Zhenhai incident, treating this serious issue with an extremely erroneous corrupt conciliatory and liberalistic attitude, failing to launch a resolute struggle against Wang Zhenhai's anti-Party criminal behavior, and failing to actively support Fan Wenxing's righteous actions, but instead suppressing them arbitrarily. After Wang Zhenhai's erroneous behavior was investigated and clarified by the Prefectural Committee, the Prefectural Committee did not report it truthfully, nor did it handle it seriously and responsibly. Instead, it intentionally made a false report to the Provincial Committee, playing a role in shielding and condoning the anti-Party element Wang Zhenhai. Its mistake is serious. It is decided to give it a partial reorganization.
    The Hebei Provincial Committee did not seriously accept the bloody lessons of the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan betrayal case, and still treated this serious incident with a bureaucratic attitude, adopting a laissez-faire attitude towards the mistakes of cadres, especially the mistakes of certain senior cadres, so that the mistakes made by cadres could not be corrected in time, resulting in serious consequences. It is decided to give it a reprimand.
    The former Wuji County Committee blindly implemented Wang Zhenhai's erroneous instructions, did not listen to the correct opinions of lower-level cadres, and wrongly expelled Li Xiaoliu from the Party and wrongly arrested Li Xiaoliu twice. It is decided to give it a reprimand; to give Zhou Hongyi, the former Secretary of the Wuji County Committee, Zhang Jishi, the Minister of the Organization Department, and Zhang Zhichao, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, a public warning.
    (2) Commendation
    Fan Wenxing, former Deputy Secretary of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee, actively reported this serious incident to the Hebei Provincial Committee, the North China Bureau, and the CCP Central Committee, and waged a resolute struggle against the anti-Party element Wang Zhenhai, and should be commended.
    The victim, Li Xiaoliu, was framed by the anti-Party criminals Wang Zhenhai and Zhang Ying for actively leading the land reform struggle, suffered injustice for four years, was unjustifiably expelled from the Party, removed from his position as village chief, and arrested twice, being wrongly imprisoned for more than ten months. Therefore, when handling this incident, a meeting should be held in Dongniu Village to publicly announce that Li Xiaoliu's service as an intelligence officer in the puppet security army was dispatched by our side, remove his traitor label, restore his Party membership, and encourage his active work and persistence in struggle.

    中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会作出决定
    开除反党分子王振海出党
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会对前定县地委书记王振海违法乱纪事件（见一月十九日本报第三版），已经处理完毕，于三月四日作出“关于反党分子前定县地委书记王振海犯罪事件的
    决定”，并经中共中央批准。决定全文如下：
    河北省前定县地委书记王振海，为了达到私人报复的目的，利用职权，阴谋陷害党员李小六的严重事件，经过我们长时期多方面的对证和调查之后，真相业已大白，王振海的反党罪行，业已完全证实。
    李小六（即李英）是河北省无极县东牛村人，共产党员。一九四二年日寇“五一”扫荡后，李小六被我方派遣至正定伪治安军中作情报工作，并有一定成绩。一九四七年土地改革时，李积极领导本村农民向封建势力作坚决斗争，斗争锋芒曾触及王振海的爱人张英个人的及其家庭的利益，自此即招来张英方面的仇恨。
    张英（共产党员，当时任安国县城关区区委组织委员）的家庭，在过去曾是东牛村拥有二百多亩土地的大地主，一九三三年后下降为中农。张英自参加革命后，其自私自利的思想并未得到改造。一九四六年张英从她娘家分得一部分土地，并将王振海和两个小孩的名字都写在她娘家的负担册上，以少纳对国家的负担。一九四八年土地改革时又在王振海家分了五个人（王、张及其小孩）的土地、房屋。张英在她本村的土地改革中，不仅不支持农民斗争，反而干涉土地改革，包庇家庭。一九四七年进行土地改革复查时，张英听到其家庭因怕斗争藏起的两个包袱被贫农团查获的消息后，即藉口这是她的包袱，亲自将包袱从贫农团手中要回，并反咬一口说包袱里短少了东西。为此贫农团曾令其在群众大会上作了公开检讨，事后张英表示这比打她几个耳光还要难堪，大不甘心。复查中，群众又将张英的本家叔父（在任伪保长的秘书时有贪污行为）清算斗争。一九四八年春，因当时群众不明政策，又以“查三代”的办法将张英家划为破落地主，将张英父亲李白雪扣押十余天，并计划拆掉张英在娘家所分的三间砖房。此时张英又回家住了十多天，直接干涉农民的土地改革复查工作，由此引起区村干部的极大不满。经县委提出意见后，张英才被迫离开。自此以后，张英便对李小六怀恨在心，积极策动其爱人王振海，藉王之职权，对李小六实行报复陷害。
    王振海和张英为了达到报复陷害的目的，并把这一罪恶目的巧妙地掩盖起来，首先利用李小六曾在伪治安军中充任过情报员这一事实，捏造了李小六种种“罪名”。一九四八年八月，王振海亲赴无极县，向当时县委委员周鸿义、张济世等当面介绍了李小六的所谓“罪恶事实”，将被我方派遣至伪治安军中作情报工作的共产党员李小六，诬说成是“投敌干部”，说“李在正定伪治安军当情报室主任时，对人民危害很大，我们的工作进不去，并杀过我们的区委书记”（意思是指张英的哥哥区委书记李硕彦是李小六所杀，而事实是李硕彦系被当时汉奸王荣贵向敌告密而被杀害的，与李小六毫无关系），又造谣说“当时藁无县委曾决定将李小六作为‘单打一’的对象”。实际并无此事。张英在一九四九年一月及一九五○年四月，亦向无极县委介绍了李小六的“情况”，把在村积极工作的李小六诬说成是“掌握村中大权，专闹宗派、闹不团结的坏分子”，说李小六“手黑”（暗杀人的意思）。王振海并把东牛村的贫富情况也给颠倒过来：东牛村明明是东头富西头穷，他却向县委硬说是东头穷（他丈人李白雪住东头）西头富（李小六住西头）。根据自己所捏造的这些事实，王振海于一九四八年八月指示无极县委开除李小六的党籍，撤销其村长职务。当时无极县委盲目地执行了王振海的错误指示，宣布开除李小六的党籍，但由于区委和村支部提出不同意见，因此李小六回村后仍过党的组织生活。王振海闻讯后，又于一九四九年一月与张英共同嘱咐定县地委委员晋仰贤办理此事。晋仰贤即督促无极县委开除李小六的党籍。王振海并在地委召集的一次干部会议上公开批评了无极县委不切实执行他的指示。至此无极县委乃于一九四九年八月派专人赴东牛村开除了李小六的党籍，建议政府撤掉了李的村长职务，并于一九五○年三月第一次逮捕了李小六。因李小六被捕前曾到河北省军区找过当时派他做情报工作的牛臻同志（河北军区侦察科长），并由牛写了证明信给定县专区专员赵树光和军分区司令员廖鼎琳，这才通知无极县将李小六释放。
    这时，定县地委会才了解了王振海和张英的这种罪恶勾当。前定县军分区司令员廖鼎琳同志在地委会上指出：李小六当伪治安军情报员是我方所派遣的，有牛臻写给专员赵树光和他自己的信为证，张英的行动是个人报复。但是地委会既不将王振海、张英的这种严重的反党行为报告省委，也不向王振海展开正确的斗争，而采取了不可容忍的腐朽的自由主义态度，这实际上是纵容了王振海的罪恶行动。此后，王振海改变其手法，继续其阴谋活动：一方面对李小六充任伪治安军情报员系我方派遣并有负责同志证明这一根本事实，装聋作哑，故作不信任；另方面在行动上则将其以前公开捏造宣传李小六“罪恶”的手法，改变为对县委欺骗、对地委和省委隐瞒的手法，利用一九五一年四月镇压反革命运动的机会，进一步企图置李小六于死地。当时王振海亲到无极县，瞒着地委指示县委将李小六作为反革命分子处理。值得注意的是，王振海此次向无极县委介绍李小六的“情形”时，对李小六当敌人情报员系我方派遣这一十分重要的事实，依然只字不提。无极县委在王振海此行以前，既未发现李小六有任何血债，又未接到群众任何检举材料，所以在逮捕第一、二批反革命分子名单中均无李小六名字。在王振海指示后，无极县委便盲目地根据王振海所介绍的“罪恶事实”，将李小六列入死刑缓期执行的反革命罪犯的名单中，于五月报送地委审批。王振海亲自审阅了李小六的案卷材料，于一九五一年六月二日亲自携带一批案卷赴河北省报案（其中有李小六），报案时又同样地隐瞒了李小六当情报员系我方派遣的事实，因而骗得了省的批准（批准逮捕、经审讯证实后再行定案）。于是李小六在同年七月二日第二次被捕。李小六被捕后，王振海即于七月底又亲赴无极县，督促无极县委调查搜集李小六的罪恶材料。其后虽经张英嫂子（李硕彦妻）等人捏词控告，但终未查出李小六任何罪恶事实。迟至一九五二年五月，李小六始被讨保释放，冤狱达十个月之久。
    一九五一年八月，前定县地委副书记范文兴向河北省委揭发了这一事件，但河北省委对于这样重大的案件，既不派人彻查，也不责令定县地委负责查清，却错误地写信给王振海本人令其作检讨。王振海不但不作任何检讨，反而明目张胆地追查检举人，大骂范文兴，声言要与范文兴到“中央、华北局打官司”，企图将主持正义的范文兴同志打击下去。当时大多数地委委员对王振海的这种目无党纪国法的行为，采取了毫无原则的态度，甚至地委委员申象山在一九五一年十月地委党的小组会上，批评范文兴不经过组织向省委反映问题“会极大的影响干部之间的团结”，并极端错误地追问范文兴反映问题的动机“是否有地位观念”。对于申象山的这种荒谬的说法，除副专员冀时新同志表示反对外，其他地委委员如林达宇、赵树光等竟不表示反对意见。十月底，地委派专员赵树光、组织部长李国庆到无极县调查这一案件。此次调查虽已证实“李小六无罪，张英对李小六挟嫌报复，王振海搞李小六是张英所策动”，但仅因王振海和张英矢口抵赖，地委也就不坚持真理，于十一月向省委写了一个混淆事实、掩盖王振海错误的假报告，而省委也竟相信了这个假报告，未采取任何必要措施。这就再度纵容了王振海的犯罪行为，使其有坚持错误的余地。在李小六被宣告无罪释放两个月之后，王振海和张英居然还私自三次写信给原无极县委敌工部长刘学及其他敌工人员，示意他们提供李小六的所谓“罪恶事实”，企图顽抗到底。
    一九五二年三月，范文兴同志再次向河北省委揭发了这一事件，河北省委纪律检查委员会才派人赴定县地委进行调查。虽然此次调查结果更加详尽地证实了王振海和张英的犯罪行为，但地委依然无原则地藉口案情复杂，将此案件推给省委了事，而河北省委在这一问题上亦同样采取了官僚主义态度，以案情复杂，一时难以弄清为理由，错误地采取了“具结了案”的办法，认为王振海主要是犯了“主观主义”的错误，仅给以当众警告的处分，草草结案。直至此次华北局纪律检查委员会调集河北省委纪律检查委员会、定县地委、前无极县委各有关干部二十余人，联合进行了反复的对证和调查之后，王振海的上述反党罪行才得以完全暴露，并一一予以证实。
    以上全部事实说明：王振海和张英从极端的个人主义、自私自利出发，背叛党的利益和人民的利益，完全站到反党反人民的立场上，依仗职权，报复陷害革命同志，为了达到这个罪恶的目的，王振海和张英才藉口李小六曾充任伪治安军情报员，不惜由此捏造种种事实，混淆是非，颠倒黑白，硬给李小六加上反革命的罪名。王振海不在土地改革以前而偏偏要在土地改革以后来提起李小六的问题，而当李小六的派遣关系已有负责人员证明之后，王振海还继续在这个问题上装聋作哑，在实际处理时又不敢经过正当的组织手续，而实行瞒上欺下的办法，这一切，正是为了达到上述罪恶的目的。由此可见，王振海已完全堕落到反党反人民的地步，已是一个不可救药的分子。定县地委会（除了个别同志外）在处理这一案件中的严重无原则和自由主义错误，以及河北省委在对待这一问题上的官僚主义态度，放纵了这一事件的发展，因而也应担负一定的政治责任。
    根据以上事实及该案的严重性质，为了严肃党纪，教育全党，中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会决定对有关人员和有关组织作如下处理：
    （一）对个人和组织的处分
    王振海目无党纪国法，完全从极端的个人主义自私自利出发，利用职权，对革命同志实行报复陷害，并企图坚持错误到底，已证明其为不可救药的反党反人民的分子，决定开除其党籍，并建议政府依法处理。
    张英，现任定县地委纪律检查委员会干事，是王振海事件的积极策动者和参加者，并在土地改革中包庇家庭，干涉土地改革，非法多占农民斗争果实，完全丧失了共产党员的条件，决定开除其党籍，建议政府依法处理，并追回非法多占之土地。
    赵树光，前定县专区专员、定县地委常委委员，现任河北省人民政府粮食厅厅长。在王振海事件中，不坚持党的原则，对纵容王振海的错误负有重大责任。赵虽在地委会上听到过廖鼎琳介绍李小六的派遣关系和张英对李小六的报复行为，并曾亲自接到过牛臻关于李小六派遣关系的证明信，但仍以腐朽的自由主义态度对待这一严重问题，不向王振海展开坚决斗争。一九五一年十月，赵与李国庆（定县地委组织部长）赴无极县调查此事件时，既不理睬县委提出的关于释放李小六的正确意见，调查后又有意向省委作假报告。一九五二年七月地委讨论处理王振海的问题时，更从个人得失出发，对如此重大的问题庸俗地看成是“范文兴与王振海的私人成见”，主张不给王振海以处分。其错误是严重的，决定给以撤销工作处分。
    李国庆，前任定县地委组织部长（常委委员），现任定县地委第一副书记。在此事件中，李毫无原则地把范文兴检举王振海的正义行动，看成是闹私人成见，采取了调和主义和自由主义的态度，从所谓“维系两人的关系和不影响工作出发”，因而在一九五一年与赵树光到无极县调查后，本来事情已大体弄清，但却仍有意欺骗省委，向省委作了假报告。决定给以撤销工作处分。
    林达宇，前定县地委秘书长，现任地委第二副书记。在此案件中，不坚持党的原则，对范文兴抱个人成见，为王振海的反党行为作辩护，决定给以当众警告处分。至林达宇在工作中的其他错误，由河北省委查清后，另行处理。
    申象山，前定县地委宣传部副部长，现任地委宣传部长。在此事件中，申不坚持党的原则，不向反党分子王振海展开斗争，反错误地批评范文兴不经组织反映问题“会极大的影响干部之间的团结”，决定给以当众警告处分。
    前定县地委副书记李太（现任中央重工业部直属工程公司副经理）、地委组织部副部长晋仰贤（现任河北省人民政府商业厅副厅长）在王振海事件中不坚持党的原则，在事实大体查清后，还不向王振海进行斗争，决定给以当众警告处分。
    冀时新（前定县专区副专员，现任专员）、王树南（前定县军分区政治部主任，现任唐山军分区政治部主任），李庆林（前定县专区合作社主任），在这一事件中表现了麻木不仁的态度，均应作深刻检讨。
    定县地委会，在王振海事件中表现了严重丧失党的原则，以极端错误的腐朽的调和主义、自由主义态度对待这一严重问题，对王振海的反党犯罪行为不开展坚决的斗争，对范文兴的正义行动不积极予以支持，反而肆行压抑；王振海的错误行为经地委会派人查清后，地委会不据实上报，亦不严肃负责地进行处理，竟有意地向省委作假报告，起了包庇纵容反党分子王振海的作用，其错误是严重的，决定给以部分改组处分。
    河北省委会未认真接受刘青山、张子善叛党事件的血的教训，仍以官僚主义态度对待这一严重事件，对干部的错误特别对某些高级干部的错误采取姑息态度，使干部所犯的错误不能得到及时纠正，以致造成严重的恶果。决定给以指责处分。
    原无极县委会盲目地执行王振海的错误指示，不听取下级干部的正确意见，错误地开除李小六党籍并两次错捕李小六，决定给以指责处分；给原无极县委书记周鸿义、组织部长张济世、公安局长张志超以当众警告处分。
    （二）表扬
    前定县地委副书记范文兴，积极地向河北省委、华北局和中共中央揭发了这一严重事件，并对反党分子王振海作坚决斗争，应予表扬。
    受害人李小六因积极领导土地改革斗争，为反党犯罪分子王振海、张英所陷害，含冤达四年之久，被无故开除党籍、撤掉村长职务，两次遭逮捕，冤狱十月余。因之，在处理这一事件时，应在东牛村召开会议，公开宣布李小六当伪治安军情报员是我方所派遣，摘掉其汉奸帽子，恢复其党籍，对其积极工作，坚持斗争应予以鼓励。
