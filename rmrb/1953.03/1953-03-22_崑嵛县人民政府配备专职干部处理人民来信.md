    Kunyu County People's Government Assigns Full-Time Cadres to Handle People's Letters
    A letter from the Kunyu County People's Government, Shandong Province, states: The criticism raised by Comrade Xing Yurong in the People's Daily on November 13th of last year, that "the Kunyu County People's Government does not pay enough attention to handling people's letters," is very correct. Based on that opinion and instructions from higher authorities, we have conducted an inspection of the work of handling people's letters and visits. Because we did not sufficiently recognize the great political significance of handling people's letters and visits, and because we did not sufficiently recognize the consistency between being responsible to the people and being responsible to higher authorities, leading cadres and general cadres alike did not pay enough attention to this work. We once considered this work an "extra burden," a "minor matter" that could be delayed or not done at all, resulting in not assigning full-time cadres or designating specific individuals to be responsible, nor establishing necessary systems, thus creating the situation described in Comrade Xing Yurong's article. This also shows that we lack a mass viewpoint and a wholehearted dedication to serving the people. In order to correct past mistakes, in addition to organizing relevant cadres for study, we have assigned full-time cadres to this work, and each department has designated specific individuals to be responsible, and established necessary systems. At the same time, a special group has also been established to lead this work. Recently, we also formulated a plan for this work, the first task being to thoroughly clear up last year's backlog of cases.

### 崑嵛县人民政府配备专职干部处理人民来信

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    崑嵛县人民政府配备专职干部处理人民来信
    山东省崑嵛县人民政府来信：去年十一月十三日人民日报上邢育朗同志提出的“崑嵛县人民政府不重视处理人民来信工作”的批评，非常正确。我们已经根据那意见和上级的指示，对处理人民来信来访工作作了检查。我们由于对处理人民来信来访工作的重大政治意义认识不足，由于对人民负责与对上级负责的一致性认识不足，因而从领导干部到一般干部都对这一工作不重视。我们曾经认为这一工作是“额外负担”，是“小事情”，可以缓办或不办，以致没有配备专职干部或责成专人负责，也没有制订必要的制度，以致造成邢育朗同志文中所说的情况。这也说明我们缺乏群众观念和缺乏全心全意为人民服务的观念。为了纠正过去的错误，我们除已经组织有关干部进行了学习外，并已配备了这一工作的专职干部，所属各部门也责成专人负责这一工作，并建立了必要的制度。同时还建立了领导这一工作的专门小组。最近，我们并作出了关于这一工作的计划，首先要彻底清理去年的积案。
