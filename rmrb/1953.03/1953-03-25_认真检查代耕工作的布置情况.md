    Conscientiously Check the Arrangement of Substitute Farming Work

    At present, spring production activities have already begun, and spring plowing has started in most areas. All localities should, together with checking the preparations for spring plowing, conduct a conscientious check on the arrangement of substitute farming work. First, it is necessary to check whether the determination of substitute farming is reasonable and whether cadres have deviations in their understanding of the substitute farming policy. With the continuous improvement and refinement of the overall preferential treatment work, especially after the universal rectification of substitute farming work around the Spring Festival this year, in general, fairness and reasonableness in determining substitute farming have been achieved, but some deviations still exist in some areas. Taking the North China region as an example, some county, district, and township (village) cadres mechanically applied the higher-level people's government's overall requirements for the scope of substitute farming to each township (village) or each family of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel enjoying substitute farming, rigidly stipulating that the land enjoyed by substitute farming should not exceed a certain percentage limit. More seriously, some local cadres still have strong selfish views in their minds. They are dissatisfied with the measures to rectify the overly broad scope of substitute farming enjoyed by the families of non-salaried staff and workers, and even developed a resistance mentality. Therefore, they cannot conscientiously implement the decisions of higher authorities, or they adopt negative confrontational measures to reduce the scope of substitute farming for both families of non-salaried staff and workers and families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. As a result, the scope of substitute farming for the families of non-salaried staff and workers has not been reduced to the appropriate extent, while the scope of substitute farming for the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel has been excessively reduced, so that practical problems cannot be solved. According to the regulations of the North China region, the land enjoyed by families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel for substitute farming is 25 percent, and the land for families of non-salaried staff and workers is 10 percent; however, the results of the implementation in nine counties of the Yanbei Special District in Shanxi Province show that the land enjoyed by families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel for substitute farming accounts for only 14.3 percent of their total land on average, a reduction of 10.7 percent compared to the overall requirement; while the land enjoyed by families of non-salaried staff and workers for substitute farming reaches 13.5 percent of their total land, an increase of 3.5 percent compared to the overall requirement. As for the phenomena of substitute farming that should be provided but is not, and substitute farming that should not be provided but is, are even more common. These deviations must be brought to the attention of leaders in various localities, and checks should be conducted quickly while the substitute farming work is being arranged. Cadres who fail to conscientiously implement the substitute farming policy should be criticized and educated, and even punished; problems that have been discovered must be thoroughly handled and corrected. In this way, while appropriately taking care of the labor burden of the masses, substitute farming can truly solve the difficulties of poor families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel who are unable to produce.

    Secondly, it is necessary to check the organization of substitute farming work, including helping families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel find good substitute farming objects, signing substitute farming contracts, and mobilizing those who undertake substitute farming (substitute farming teams or mutual aid teams) to make annual substitute farming plans, etc. If this series of organizational work is not done well, not only will the current spring plowing and sowing of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel who enjoy substitute farming not be carried out well, but it will also inevitably affect the planned arrangement of substitute farming work throughout the year. Therefore, those that have not been done should be started immediately, and no further delays should be allowed; those that have been done but not done well should be supplemented and revised quickly to make them perfect. When helping families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel choose substitute farming objects, in order to adapt to the direction of rural production development, in places where agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations have been established, agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations should be mobilized and organized as much as possible to cultivate the substitute farming land of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, and they should be mobilized to include the substitute farming plan in their entire production plan, so as to ensure that the substitute farming land can be cultivated in a timely manner and achieve the same yield increase or increased production. In addition, it is necessary to effectively help families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel prepare sufficient fertilizer. Because this is an important condition for improving the unit area yield of land, cooperatives in various localities should give them priority when selling fertilizer on credit and providing fertilizer loans. For families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel who are unable to accumulate and purchase fertilizer due to being orphans, widows, elderly, weak, or disabled, practical ways should be found to help them solve the fertilizer problem. For example, some places in the past launched a campaign to donate "one basket of manure," established public toilets for them, and mobilized households with sheep to let them lie on the ground, all of which have achieved good results, and can be adopted for reference in various localities.

    Finally, it is necessary to check the situation of helping and organizing families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel to participate in production. Facts have proved that helping families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel actively participate in production and establish family businesses is the fundamental way to solve and improve their lives. At the same time, facts have also proved that although some families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel do have many difficulties in production, as long as they are given good education and helped to solve their difficulties, they can carry forward the revolutionary tradition and actively participate in productive labor. In particular, with the development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations, more favorable conditions have been created for them to actively participate in production. Therefore, various localities should, while checking the substitute farming work, also conduct an in-depth check on the situation of helping families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel participate in production. Persuasive education should be carried out on the phenomenon that some agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations are unwilling to absorb families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, and practical solutions should be given to the difficulties in production and living materials that exist in some families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, especially in poor mountainous areas and areas with spring famine, in conjunction with the distribution of disaster relief grain and material subsidies, grain loans, and loans, and help and organize them to do a good job in spring plowing and harrowing to conserve moisture and drought resistance. In this way, on the one hand, their production enthusiasm will be encouraged, and on the other hand, the substitute farming work will be strengthened, so that the production and living of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel will be greatly improved this year.

    认真检查代耕工作的布置情况
    目前，春季生产活动已经开始，大部地区并已开始春耕。各地亟应和检查春耕准备工作一起，对代耕工作的布置情况进行认真的检查。首先，要检查代耕确定的是不是合理，干部对代耕政策的掌握是不是有偏差。随着整个优抚工作的不断提高和改进，特别是经过今年春节前后对代耕工作的普遍整顿，一般都做到了确定代耕的公平与合理，但也有些地区还存在一些偏差。以华北地区为例，有些县、区、乡（村）干部把上级人民政府对代耕面的总要求，机械地搬用到每个乡（村）或每户享受代耕的烈、军属身上，一律死硬地规定享受代耕土地不得超过一定的比例限度。更严重的是有些地方干部思想上还有浓厚的自私观点，他们对纠正非薪金制工作人员家属享受代耕面过宽的措施不满意，甚至产生了抵抗情绪，因此，不能认真地执行上级决定，或是采取要缩小代耕面就要非薪金制工作人员家属和烈、军属一样缩小的消极对抗办法。结果，非薪金制工作人员家属代耕面没缩小到应有的程度，烈、军属的代耕面却过分地缩小了，以致不能解决实际问题。按华北区规定烈、军属享受代耕土地面为百分之二十五，非薪金制工作人员家属为百分之十；但山西省雁北专区有九个县执行的结果，却是烈、军属享受代耕的土地平均仅占其所有土地的百分之十四点三，较总要求减少了百分之十点七；而非薪金制工作人员家属享受代耕土地竟达其所有土地的百分之十三点五，较总要求提高了百分之三点五。至于应代耕而未代耕、不应代耕而代耕了的现象就更为普遍。这些偏差，必须引起各地领导上的重视，趁着目前正在布置代耕工作的时机，迅速进行检查。对不能认真贯彻代耕政策的干部要给予批评和教育，甚至处分；对已发现的问题要彻底处理和纠正。这样，才能在适当照顾群众劳力负担的情况下，使代耕真正能解决贫苦烈、军属无力生产的困难。
    其次，要检查代耕工作的组织情况，包括帮助烈、军属找好代耕对象，订立代耕合同，发动承担代耕的人或组（代耕组或互助组）做好全年的代耕计划等等。这一系列的组织工作如果做不好，不但使享受代耕的烈、军属目前的春耕、播种不能很好进行，而且也势必影响到全年代耕工作的有计划的安排。因此，还没有做的应马上着手做，不能再拖延；虽然做了但没有做好的应赶快补充、修正，使臻于完善。在帮助烈、军属选择代耕对象的时候，为了适应农村生产发展的方向，凡已经成立农业互助、合作组织的地方，应该尽量发动与组织农业互助、合作组织承种烈、军属的代耕土地，并动员他们把代耕计划列到他们整个生产计划以内，以便保证代耕土地能适时耕种，并同样达到丰产或增产。另外，要切实帮助烈、军属准备好足够的肥料。因为这是提高土地单位面积产量的重要条件，各地合作社在赊售肥料和举办肥料贷款时，要给予他们优先照顾。对无力积肥购肥的孤、寡、老、弱烈、军属，应想出切实帮助他们解决肥料问题的办法，如过去有些地方曾发动群众开展捐助“一筐粪”运动，为他们建立公共厕所，动员有羊户给他们卧地等，均曾收到很好的效果，各地可参照采用。
    最后，要检查帮助与组织烈、军属参加生产的情况。事实证明，帮助烈、军属积极地参加生产，建立家务，是解决和提高他们生活的根本办法。同时事实也证明，虽然有些烈、军属在生产中确实存在着许多困难，但是，只要对他们进行很好的教育，帮助他们解决了困难，他们是能够发扬革命传统，积极地参加生产劳动的。特别是随着农业互助、合作组织的发展，更加给他们创造了积极参加生产的有利条件。因此，各地应该在检查代耕工作的同时，也要对帮助烈、军属参加生产的情况进行深入检查。对有些农业互助、合作组织不愿吸收烈、军属参加的现象要进行说服教育，对有些烈、军属存在的生产、生活资料等困难，特别是在贫瘠山区和有春荒的地区，应结合发放救灾粮和实物补助款、贷粮、贷款等工作给予切实解决，并帮助与组织他们做好春耕和耙地保墒等防旱抗旱工作。这样，一方面鼓舞他们的生产情绪，一方面加强代耕工作，就会使今年烈、军属的生产和生活大大提高一步。
