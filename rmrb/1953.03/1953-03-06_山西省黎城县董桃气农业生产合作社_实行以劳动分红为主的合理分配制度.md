    Shanxi Province, Licheng County, Dong Taoqi Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Implements a Rational Distribution System Based Primarily on Labor Dividends
    When the Dong Taoqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Licheng County, Shanxi Province, was established in April two years ago, it adopted a distribution method based on a labor-dominated proportional dividend system. The specific distribution ratio was: labor accounted for 51%, land accounted for 40%, and public accumulation funds accounted for 9%. Except for two households with more land and less labor, the other twenty-one households were very satisfied with this distribution method; it was implemented for a year without major problems.

    However, before last year's autumn harvest, many members had opinions when the cooperative prepared to continue distributing the harvest according to this ratio. Chen Shu-huai, the member who had been most active in labor in the past and had earned the most workdays, became passive during the autumn harvest. Dong Taoqi, the cooperative director, discovered this situation and took the initiative to talk to him, asking him why he had not been working hard recently. Chen Shu-huai said, "We have little land and a lot of labor. If the distribution method is not changed, the grain produced by labor will all be taken by those with more land." Dong Taoqi asked him to explain his reasoning. Chen Shu-huai said, "Take my two mu and five fen of land in Shiyugou as an example. Before joining the cooperative, each mu only yielded seven dou and five sheng of grain annually. After joining the cooperative, everyone leveled the slopes and filled the depressions, using sixty-four workdays. This year, each mu of wheat yielded two shi and two dou, an increase of one shi and four dou and five sheng. Isn't this increase created by labor? It's not reasonable for the land to take 40% of it." He also gave an example: "Yue Licun's three mu and three fen of land in Shapengnao used to be red soil. Before joining the cooperative, each mu only yielded seven or eight dou of grain. After joining the cooperative, everyone applied smoked wasteland fertilizer, using two hundred and ninety dan of manure per mu, improving the soil. This year, each mu yielded one shi and nine dou, more than double what it used to yield. How can this be given to the land?" Dong Taoqi felt that what he said made sense and went to ask Chen Xigui and Chen Tongqing, who did a lot of work, for their opinions. They expressed the same opinions. Chen Tongqing also told Dong Taoqi, "These opinions are not new; they arose after the autumn harvest distribution in 1951." Chen Tongqing, who was literate, could calculate, and worked hard, said, "In 1951, we plowed more, hoed more, and applied more fertilizer, and the actual yield per mu increased by 14.6% compared to the yield assessed when the cooperative was established. This increase should have been entirely distributed by labor, but the land took 40%." At this moment, Dong Taoqi suddenly remembered something: this year, everyone was asking to cut and pad and improve the soil in their own fields, making it difficult to implement the cooperative's unified plan. It turned out that they were all trying to get more grain for their land, not thinking about the overall benefit of the cooperative. "How can this continue?" He convened the cooperative affairs committee, raised the issues he had learned, and asked everyone to consider them in order to formulate a further plan to implement the principle of distribution according to work with labor as the primary factor. After studying the matter, everyone felt that the best way was to fix the amount of land dividends and implement a "fixed rent" system, using 40% of the yield assessed when the land joined the cooperative as an absolute figure, and the land would no longer receive dividends for the increased production due to processing. Once the distribution principle was determined, they considered how to implement it. Everyone said: They were afraid that the six households of Yue Jinghe and Fan Enming, who had more land and less labor, would not accept the new plan. Everyone believed that to solve the problems of the masses, the problems of the cadres must be solved first. Among the cadres, Vice Director Lu Erhei had more land and less labor. Everyone first sought Lu Erhei's opinion. Lu Erhei, the secretary of the New Democratic Youth League branch, had a high level of political awareness and immediately expressed his complete agreement with this distribution principle. The cooperative affairs committee then took this new distribution method to the members' congress for discussion. As expected, the only ones who raised objections were the six households of Yue Jinghe and Fan Enming. They had little labor and a large population, and they were afraid that they would not be able to maintain their livelihood if the land dividends were reduced. However, the members with more labor and those who earned more workdays actively supported the new plan. Members with neither too much nor too little land and neither too many nor too few workdays also supported the new plan. Therefore, the main problem in implementing the new plan was how to persuade these six dissenting members. These six households formed an "alliance" during the discussion, and their opinion was, "The cooperative is about democracy. If we don't agree, they can't decide." Although the six households were a minority, they had to be persuaded properly, otherwise, the cooperative would be in danger of splitting. Therefore, the cooperative affairs committee asked Lu Erhei to persuade the six households because Lu Erhei's land and labor were similar to theirs. Lu Erhei explained the rationality of the new distribution plan to these six households, but they could not accept it. Lu Erhei compared his own situation with the six households, leaving them with no way to refute, and they had to say, "If you can do it, so can we." Although they said this, they were still somewhat reluctant. In this situation, the cooperative affairs committee had to implement the new distribution plan according to the opinions of the majority of the members.

    The distribution situation under the new plan was as follows: The total agricultural net income of the cooperative was 100,326 jin of coarse grains. After deducting the "fixed rent" of 20,736 jin distributed to the land and deducting 9,294 jin for public accumulation funds, the remaining 73,235 jin were distributed according to labor. The labor dividend portion accounted for over 70% of the total income. In addition, the sideline income of 14,600 jin was entirely distributed to labor. The distribution result was: among the 27 households in the cooperative (four new households joined last year), eight households received more than 2,000 jin more grain than the previous year, twelve households received more than 1,000 jin more than the previous year, six households received more than 500 jin more than the previous year, and only one household received 25 jin less than the previous year. The reason why this household received less was that one laborer went out to work. That is to say, everyone's income increased compared to the previous year, and the six households no longer had any objections.

    This distribution method made the members who were active in labor in the past even more active, and those who were not very active also became active. After the autumn harvest, the cooperative affairs committee planned to apply 4,800 loads of fertilizer to the wheat fields. The original plan was to deliver it to the fields in half a month, but it was completed in ten days. The third plowing of the wheat fields was originally planned to be completed in eight days, but it was completed in five days. The above two farming tasks saved 395 workdays. In the past, the land that members joined the cooperative with accounted for only 71% of their total land on average. Now, everyone calculated that the income from collective labor on the land joined the cooperative was more than the income from labor on private plots. Therefore, after the autumn harvest, the land that members joined the cooperative with increased to 90% on average. This phenomenon fully proves that the agricultural production cooperative's adoption of a system that is primarily based on labor, with land receiving a fixed rent, is a relatively rational distribution system. Implementing this system according to the specific situation is beneficial to rewarding labor, increasing production, and promoting a high degree of organization.

    山西省黎城县董桃气农业生产合作社
    实行以劳动分红为主的合理分配制度
    山西省黎城县董桃气农业生产合作社在前年四月建社时，采用以劳力为主的比例分红制的分配办法。具体分配比例是：劳力分百分之五十一，土地分百分之四十，公积金留百分之九。这个分配办法，除两户土地多、劳力少的社员不太同意外，其余二十一户社员都很满意；实行了一年，没有发生多大问题。
    但在去年秋收以前，该社准备继续按这种比例分配收获物时，许多社员都有了意见。过去劳动最积极、获得劳动日最多的社员陈树槐在秋收中都消极起来了。社长董桃气发现了这种情况，就主动地找他谈心，问他最近为什么劳动不起劲。陈树槐说：“咱地少劳力多，不改变分配办法，靠劳力增产的粮食，都让地多的分去了。”董桃气请他说出理由，陈树槐说：“就以我柿峪沟那二亩五分地来说吧，入社前每亩常年只打七斗五升粮食；入社后经大家平坡填凹，用了六十四个工，今年种麦每亩收了二石二斗，增产的这一石四斗五，不是劳动力创造出来的吗？百分之四十让地多的分了去，这合理吗？”他又举例说：“沙蓬堖岳礼存那三亩三分地，以前是红土地，入社前每亩只打七、八斗粮食；入社后，经大家熏荒肥，每亩上了二百九十担粪，改良了土壤，今年每亩收了一石九斗，比过去多打了一倍多，这怎么能让地分去呢？”董桃气觉得他这些话很有道理；就去问做工多的社员陈喜贵、陈同庆有什么意见。他们也说了同样的意见。陈同庆并告诉董桃气说：“这种意见不是现在才有的，一九五一年秋收分配后就产生了。”陈同庆是个识字多、会算账、劳动好的人，他说：“一九五一年咱们多耕、多锄、多上粪，每亩实产量比建社时评定的产量提高了百分之十四点六。这些增产部分，本来应该叫劳动力全部分去的，但土地却分去了百分之四十。”这时，董桃气忽然想起了一件事情：今年谁都要求在自己的地里里切外垫、改良土壤，弄得社的统一计划不好实行，原来他们都是为了使自己的地多分粮，并不是为全社着想。“这样下去怎么能行呢？”他召开了社务委员会，把他所了解到的问题提出来，让大家考虑，以便制订进一步贯彻以劳力为主的按劳取酬的分配方案。大家研究以后，觉得最好是把土地的分红数量固定起来，实行“死租”制，以土地入社时评定的产量的百分之四十为绝对数字，因加工增产的部分，土地不再分红。分配原则确定了，接着就考虑如何贯彻的问题。大家说：就怕土地多劳力少的岳景和、范恩明那六户不接受这个新方案。大家认为：要解决群众的问题，必须首先解决干部的问题。在干部中，副社长陆二黑入地较多，劳力较少。大家就先征求陆二黑的意见。陆二黑是新民主主义青年团的支部书记，政治觉悟较高，立即表示完全同意这个分配原则。社务委员会于是把这个新的分配办法拿到社员大会上去讨论。不出干部们的预料，提出不同意见的，只有岳景和、范恩明那六户。他们劳力少，人口多，怕土地分红少了不能维持生活。但劳动力多的和获得劳动日多的社员都积极拥护新方案。入社的土地不多不少、获得劳动日不多不少的社员也赞成新方案。因此，贯彻新方案的主要问题是如何说服这六户不同意的社员。这六户在讨论中成立了“联盟”，他们的意见是“社是讲民主的，咱们不同意，他们也不能决定”。六户虽是少数，但必须好好说服，不然合作社就有分裂的危险。社务委员会于是让陆二黑去说服那六户社员，因为陆二黑的土地、劳力和那六户社员的土地、劳力差不多。陆二黑向这六户讲了这个新的分配方案的合理性，这六户接受不了。陆二黑以自己的情况和这六户比，比的他们没了办法，只好说：“你行我们也行。”话虽这样说，但还有些勉强。在这种情况下，社务委员会只好根据大多数社员的意见，实行了新的分配方案。
    实行新方案的分配情况是这样的：全社农业纯收入是十万零三千二百六十五斤粗粮，除去土地分得“死租”二万零七百三十六斤，再除去九千二百九十四斤的公积金，下余七万三千二百三十五斤，实行劳力分红。劳力分红部分占总收入的百分之七十强。另副业收入一万四千六百斤，全归劳力分配。分配结果是：全社二十七户中（去年有四户新入了社）有八户分得的粮食超过去年分配数二千斤以上，有十二户超过去年分配数一千斤以上，有六户超过去年分配数五百斤以上，只有一户比去年少分了二十五斤。而这户分得少的原因是有一个劳动力外出参加了工作。这就是说，大家的收入比上年都增加了，那六户再也没有意见了。
    这种分配办法，使过去劳动积极的社员更加积极，过去不太积极的也变得积极了。秋收以后，社务委员会计划在麦地施肥四千八百驮，原计划半月送到地里，结果十天便完成了。麦地犁第三遍，原计划八天完成，结果五天就完成了。以上两宗农活，省工三百九十五个。过去社员入社地平均只占自己总地数的百分之七十一，现在大家计算着在自留地上劳动不如在入社土地上集体劳动收入多，因此，在秋收后，社员入社的土地平均增加到百分之九十。这种现象充分证明：农业生产合作社采用以劳力为主，土地分得固定租额的制度，是比较合理的分配制度。按照具体情况实行这种制度，对奖励劳动、增加生产、促进高度组织起来是有利的。
