Two Attitudes Toward Commandism and Illegal Discipline Violations in Grain Collection Work
Wang Shanxin

In 1952, many instances of commandism and illegal discipline violations existed in the agricultural tax collection work in various regions. Regarding this phenomenon, the people's governments in various regions held two different attitudes. One was the correct attitude of conducting thorough investigations, handling matters seriously, educating cadres, and engaging in self-criticism to improve work; the other was the bureaucratic attitude of not investigating or handling, or only investigating but not handling, or handling matters unseriously.

Here are two typical examples:

In Cang County, Hebei Province, a farmer suicide incident occurred during grain collection. The deceased, Lu Songlin, lived in Lang'erkou Village, was sixty-four years old, a bachelor, and had a foot ailment. Due to a lack of labor, he only harvested two hundred and fifty jin of grain last autumn. During the autumn grain collection, he was assigned to pay one hundred and ten jin of grain, and he requested a reduction or exemption from the village cadres. The village government chairman not only did not grant him a reduction or exemption according to the law but instead ordered, "Get him out of here." Vice Chairman Ji Zeshu grabbed Lu's collar and threatened, "You are with counter-revolutionaries every day." That night, Lu hanged himself at the door of village cadre Ji Zeshu's house but was discovered and saved by militiamen. At this point, the village cadres still did not come to their senses and sent Lu to the district. On the way, Lu broke his own head with a brick, and the village cadres took Lu to his sister's house to stay temporarily. Cadre Ma Wanrong, who was responsible for overseeing the grain collection work in the village, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. Without deeply understanding the situation, he only offered perfunctory consolation and reported to the district. The village cadres pushed the responsibility to the village public security officer to report to the district head, who said, "If the village can't solve it, send him to the district. If he can't walk, send him by cart." When the public security officer returned to the village, Lu had already secretly hanged himself in the graveyard outside the village.

After receiving the report, the Cang County Commissioner's Office and the Cang County People's Government immediately sent personnel to investigate and handle the matter. Village cadres Ji Zeshu and Liu Chunhe, who had violated policies and forced a person to death, were dismissed and handed over to the court for criminal punishment. District Head Hu Jiacai was given a demerit, and Ma Wanrong, who was responsible for the grain collection work in the village, was dismissed. Other personnel were given criticism and education. The Cang County Commissioner's Office and the Cang County People's Government also reviewed their own bureaucratic work style and requested punishment from higher authorities. On November 31st of last year, the Hebei Provincial People's Government circulated a notice about this matter throughout the province, requiring all regions to launch discussions and correct deviations.

In Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, the situation was different. In the county's grain collection work, district and village cadres, through coercion and violation of policies, forced three farmers to death. Li Jinyuan, a cadre in Youbu District, called for "less reduction is glorious" when arranging reduction and exemption work, and had a Communist Youth League member say on stage: "For the sake of patriotism, I will not ask for reduction and exemption even if I have difficulties." But Li secretly promised to find a way for him. Ye Ningkui, director of the district farmers' association, specially cultivated a "model household," letting him express in front of the masses that he would "not apply for reduction and exemption." But Ye secretly lent this "model household" seventy thousand yuan. When farmer Hu A'yuan knelt down and begged for reduction and exemption from Li Heshan, a cadre in Yongchang District, he did not consider it at all and instead scolded him as a "deserter" and a "lazybones." The village cadres also said to Hu, "If you can't pay the tax, we'll send you to a labor reform team." Hu, stimulated by this and fearing that his wife would divorce him due to financial difficulties, hanged himself. Farmer Qian Xienai was forced to hand over public grain and attempted suicide by eating pesticide but was saved. Xie Xiefu, a cadre in Majian District, not only did not comfort him but instead told Qian to "eat the pesticide again and show me." This aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses.

How did the Lanxi County People's Government treat the above facts? After the farmer suicide incidents occurred, they did not pay attention to them, nor did they seize the time to investigate and handle them. It was not until the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Finance Department sent personnel to inspect that they were forced to put forward preliminary handling opinions. They only let district cadre Li Heshan, who had forced a person to death, etc., "make a public self-criticism." They also did not make a deep self-criticism of the county's bureaucratic style and failure to implement the instructions of higher authorities in the grain collection. Although the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Finance Department conducted a relatively thorough inspection of these incidents, it did not offer any opinions on the unserious attitude of the Lanxi County People's Government.

The above two examples fully illustrate the two different attitudes toward commandism and illegal discipline violations. It should be pointed out that there are still quite a few people who hold the latter attitude. Some provincial people's governments have not yet sent responsible personnel to the scene to investigate and handle these serious incidents, nor have they made detailed and specific reports to the central competent authorities. I suggest that these leading organs immediately seriously handle these incidents in order to educate cadres, improve work style, and improve work.

    对待征粮工作中命令主义和违法乱纪现象的两种态度
    王善心
    一九五二年各地在征收农业税工作中存在着不少命令主义和违法乱纪的现象。对于这种现象，各地人民政府存在着两种不同的态度。一种是深入检查，严肃处理，教育干部，进行自我检讨以改进工作的正确态度；另一种是不检查处理，或者只检查不处理，或者不严肃地加以处理的官僚主义态度。
    下面是两个典型例子：
    河北省沧县在征粮中曾发生农民自杀事件一起。死者陆松林住狼儿口村，六十四岁，独身汉，有脚病。他因缺乏劳力，去年秋季仅收粮二百五十斤。秋征时分派他缴粮一百一十斤，他向村干部要求减免。村政府主席不但不依法予以减免，反喝令“把他弄出去”。副主席季泽树抓着陆的衣领威胁说：“你每天和反革命分子在一起”。夜里，陆到村干部季泽树门口上吊，经民兵发觉救下。这时村干部还不省悟，又将陆送到区里。陆在路上用砖打破自己的头，村干部把陆交到他姐姐家中暂住。负责掌握该村征收工作的干部马万荣闻讯赶到，没有深入了解情况，仅从旁劝解，并向区里报告。村干部互推本村公安员向区长面报，区长说：“村里解决不了，送他到区里来，走不了用大车送”。公安员回村时，陆已偷偷到村外坟地上吊死了。
    沧县专署和沧县人民政府接到报告后，立即派员调查处理，将违犯政策逼死人命的村干部季泽树、刘春和二人撤职，并送交法院给以刑事处分。给区长胡家才以记大过一次的处分，给负责该村征收工作的马万荣以撤职的处分。对其他人员分别给予批评教育。沧县专署和沧县人民政府并检讨了本身的官僚主义作风，向上级自请处分。河北省人民政府于去年十一月三十一日将此事通报全省，要求各地展开讨论，纠正偏向。
    浙江省兰溪县，却不是这样作的。该县在征收工作中，由于区、村干部强迫命令和违犯政策，曾逼死农民三人。该县游埠区干部李金元在布置减免工作时号召“少减光荣”，让一个青年团员上台说：“我为了爱国，有困难也不要求减免。”但李暗中答应给他想办法。区农会主任叶宁奎特地培养了一个“典型户”，让他在群众面前表示“不申请减免”。但叶暗中借给这个“典型户”七万元。永昌区区干部李和善在农民胡阿元向他跪求减免时，毫不考虑，反骂他是“兵痞”、“懒汉”。村干部又对胡说：“交不出税送你去劳动改造队”。胡受了这个刺激，又怕老婆因生活困难与自己离婚，就上吊自杀了。农民钱卸奶被逼缴公粮，吃杀虫药自杀得救。马涧区区干部谢卸富，不但不加以安慰，反叫钱“再吃杀虫药给我看看”。引起群众极大不满。
    兰溪县人民政府怎样对待上述事实呢？在农民自杀事件发生后，他们并不重视，也没有抓紧时间调查处理。直到浙江省人民政府财政厅派员检查后，他们才被迫提出初步处理意见。只让逼死人命的区干部李和善等“公开检讨”，对本县在征粮中的官僚主义和不执行上级指示等错误，也没有作深刻检讨。浙江省人民政府财政厅虽然对这些事件作了比较深入的检查，但对兰溪县人民政府的不严肃态度并没有提出任何意见。
    上面两个实例，充分说明了对待命令主义和违法乱纪行为的两种不同的态度。应该指出：持后一种态度的人还是相当多的。有些省人民政府对于这些严重事件，到现在还没有派负责人员到现场检查处理，也不向中央主管部门作详细具体的报告。我建议这些领导机关立即严肃处理这些事件，以教育干部，改善作风，提高工作。
