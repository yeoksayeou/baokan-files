    Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: North China's leadership at all levels has taken emergency measures to strengthen leadership over the current spring ploughing production. Before March 5th, all provinces in North China generally held spring ploughing deployment meetings, followed by issuing instructions and dispatching a large number of cadres to rural areas to inspect and promote work, assisting various localities in solving specific problems in production. Hebei Province has organized an inspection team of more than 260 people, led by Ma Guorui, Second Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC, and Zhang Kerang, Director of the Agriculture Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, to inspect various localities. Currently, nine special districts in the province have successively held meetings of responsible cadres from various counties to examine and correct the tendency to relax leadership in spring ploughing, re-arrange the current rural work, and clearly point out that spring ploughing is the overriding central task. They have also transferred 670 stronger cadres to lead spring ploughing. The conference of prefectural committee secretaries in Shanxi Province at the end of February reviewed the province's agricultural production and, based on the specific situation, revised the original mutual aid and cooperation plan, reducing the original target of organizing 70% to 80% of farmers in the province to 60% to 70%; except for the collective farms piloted in Changzhi Prefecture, other prefectures will no longer pilot them; and decided that from March 20th, all other work that could be stopped in the countryside would be stopped to concentrate efforts on spring ploughing; necessary work such as township division and township elections should be scientifically arranged and carried out around spring ploughing production. Thirty counties in the province have re-arranged their work and shifted their focus to spring ploughing production. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC and the Shanxi Provincial People's Government's Agriculture Department also sent 80 cadres to rural areas on March 23rd to inspect the spring ploughing situation. Suiyuan Province also sent spring ploughing inspection teams to agricultural and pastoral areas to assist in spring ploughing. Some counties in the province have begun to allocate cadres and specifically arrange spring ploughing steps and working methods; Taolin, Helin and other counties have sent cadres to rural areas to comprehensively check spring ploughing preparations.
    There is a general lack of rain and shallow soil moisture in North China in spring. Although various localities have made many preparations since the beginning of spring, due to the numerous and urgent tasks, the phenomenon of relaxing leadership in spring ploughing has been generally discovered. Through the above measures, the leading organs of provinces, special districts, and counties have specifically implemented the principle that spring ploughing is the overriding central task in the current rural areas in terms of guiding ideology and work arrangements. Currently, cadres going to rural areas are specifically assisting district and village leaders in solving various problems in production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 30th: The Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued a notice to its subordinate branch bureaus and provincial committees on March 27th to study the CPC Central Committee's instructions to party committees at all levels on spring ploughing production, the CPC Central Committee's resolution on mutual aid and cooperation, and the People's Daily editorial on these two documents. The notice pointed out that these three documents should be required reading for all comrades engaged in rural work. Party leading comrades at all levels should organize the staff of the party and mass organizations in the countryside, as well as the staff of the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments in the government system, to study them carefully, so that in accordance with the Central Committee's instructions, they can treat the production task as the overriding central task in the current rural areas, reasonably arrange the order of work, check and resolutely overcome the phenomena of egalitarianism and decentralism existing in the work; and through study, in accordance with the Central Committee's instructions "starting from the current production status of the small-scale peasant economy," improve the leadership methods for agricultural production movements, and check and correct the subjective and commandist work style that does not start from the "realistic situation of the rural economy," such as separation from the masses. The notice pointed out that the significance of studying the documents is the basic key to doing a good job in leading agricultural production work in the future. At present, in the transition from reform to production in various parts of Central China, the primary task is to guide all comrades to earnestly grasp the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions to ensure that the agricultural production movement in the whole region is on the right track from the beginning. Other departments related to rural work should also study these three documents so that they can act in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions when deploying work in the future.

    华北采取紧急措施加强领导春耕生产
    中共中央中南局指示学习中央有关农村工作的文件
    【新华社三十日讯】华北各级领导机关采取紧急措施，加强对当前春耕生产的领导。华北各省于三月五日前普遍召开了春耕布置会议，接着又先后发出指示和派遣大批干部下乡检查推动，协助各地解决生产中的具体问题。河北省已组织了一支二百六十多人的检查队，由中共河北省委员会第二书记马国瑞和河北省人民政府农业厅厅长张克让带领到各地检查。现全省九个专区已先后开过各县负责干部会议，检查纠正放松春耕领导的偏向，重新安排当前农村各项工作，明确指出春耕为压倒一切的中心工作，并调配了六百七十个较强的干部领导春耕。山西省二月底召开的地委书记会议，曾检查了全省的农业生产情况，根据具体情况，修改了原来的互助合作计划，将原来要求组织全省农户百分之七十到八十的任务降低到百分之六十到七十；除长治专区试办的集体农庄以外，其他专区不再试办；并决定从三月二十日开始，农村中其他可以停止的工作一律停止，集中力量进行春耕生产；必需进行的划乡、乡选等工作都要作科学的安排，围绕春耕生产进行。全省已有三十个县重新安排工作，部署转向春耕生产。中共山西省委员会、山西省人民政府农业厅在三月二十三日也派了八十个干部下乡检查春耕情况。绥远省也派出春耕检查团到农、牧区协助春耕。该省有些县已开始调配干部，具体安排春耕步骤和工作方法；陶林、和林等县已派干部下乡，全面检查春耕准备工作。
    华北春季普遍缺雨，墒土浅薄。各地入春以后虽作了不少准备，但因工作任务多而紧迫，普遍发现放松领导春耕现象。这次经过上述措施，各省、专区和县的领导机关，已从指导思想、工作安排上具体贯彻了春耕为当前农村中压倒一切的中心工作的方针，现各地下乡干部正具体协助区、村领导干部解决生产中的各项问题。
    【新华社武汉三十日电】中共中央中南局在三月二十七日向所属分局、省委发出学习中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示、中共中央关于互助合作的决议及人民日报关于这两个文件的社论的通知。通知中指出：这三个文件应作为全体从事农村工作同志的必读文件。各级党的领导同志要组织农村中党和群众团体系统的工作人员，同时也组织政府系统里农林、水利、合作部门的工作人员，认真学习，以便按照中央指示，将生产任务当作当前农村中压倒一切的中心工作，合理安排工作秩序，检查并坚决克服工作中所存在的平均主义与分散主义的现象；并能经过学习，按照中央指示“从小农经济的生产现状出发”，改进对农业生产运动的领导方法，检查和纠正不从“农村经济的现实状况”出发的主观主义与命令主义等脱离群众的作风。通知中指出，学习文件的意义是今后作好农业生产领导工作的基本关键。目前，中南各地在组织由改革到生产的转变中，首要任务就在于引导全体同志对中央指示的精神认真掌握，以保证全区农业生产运动在开始时就纳入正轨。其他与农村工作有联系的部门，也应对这三个文件进行学习，以便今后在部署工作时，能够遵照中央指示的精神行事。
