    Central-South Administrative Committee
    Issues Ten Measures for Carrying Out the Agricultural Patriotic Production Increase Movement
    And Instructs Localities to Prepare for Launching a Bumper Harvest Competition Movement in a Timely Manner
    
    The Central-South Administrative Committee issued the "Ten Measures on Carrying Out the Agricultural Patriotic Production Increase Movement" on the 6th. The ten measures are: 1. Announce the end of land reform, and people of all classes should immediately devote all their efforts to the patriotic production increase movement. However, individual areas where land reform has not been fully completed should continue to complete it. 2. Protect the private ownership of land and property of people of all classes, as well as income from labor. 3. Compel landlords to labor, and their income from labor will also be protected; their property that has not been confiscated during the land reform should be actively invested in production and will no longer be confiscated; in the future, their class status may be changed in accordance with the State Council's decision on dividing rural class components, depending on their compliance with the law and the degree of self-labor reform. If landlords have illegal or reactionary behavior, they will be severely punished once verified. 4. Allow free employment, guarantee freedom of lending, and wages or interest will be negotiated by both parties. Those who rent out a small amount of land due to lack of labor should also be guaranteed their rental income. 5. Actively and steadily develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, but must adhere to the principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, and strictly prohibit coercion; earnestly unite individual farmers, and do not exclude or discriminate against them. 6. Implement a policy of rewarding patriotic production increases and launch an agricultural bumper harvest appraisal movement. 7. Implement the agricultural tax policy of surveying fields and determining output, calculating tax rates accordingly, and legally reducing or exempting taxes, strictly prohibiting all illegal apportionments, embezzlement, extortion, and other illegal behaviors. After determining output based on normal annual yield, no additional burden will be imposed on the portion increased due to improved management. If there are individual cases of excessively high output determination during the field survey, applications for review are allowed, and corrections will be made after verification. 8. Organize credit cooperatives, strengthen supply and marketing cooperatives, and unite all private industrial and commercial enterprises beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, to facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and promote the development of industrial and agricultural products. 9. Do not violate the farming season, uniformly arrange work, and earnestly streamline meetings. In addition to the obligatory labor stipulated by the People's Government, strictly prohibit all illegal dispatch of labor or wasteful behavior of people's labor. The promotion of all work shall not be coercive. 10. Strengthen rural public security work, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and ensure the stability of social order.
    
    Also reported: The Central-South Administrative Committee issued instructions on carrying out the 1953 agricultural patriotic bumper harvest competition, requiring governments at all levels in the Central-South region to timely prepare ideologically, organizationally, and materially for launching the patriotic bumper harvest competition movement before the arrival of the spring plowing season. This year, the entire region must mobilize 500,000 mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives to participate in the competition. All state-owned farms in various localities must participate in the competition without exception and play a demonstrative and leading role in the competition. Various localities should also pay attention to mobilizing the vast number of individual farmers to join this movement.
    
    In order to successfully complete this task, the instructions put forward that the following tasks must be done well: First, strengthen ideological leadership. Various localities must combine this year's three major national tasks to carry out propaganda and education on patriotic production increase and production policies for farmers, help farmers summarize and learn advanced production experience, make farmers realize the relationship between individuals and the country, clarify the importance of patriotic production increase in the country's large-scale construction, and eliminate various ideological concerns. In the movement, it is necessary to be good at grasping the ideological development laws of cadres and farmers, and especially after the movement is launched, prevent the occurrence of purely championship-oriented thinking to ensure the healthy development of the movement. Second, vigorously rectify mutual aid and cooperation organizations and effectively launch a mass movement to formulate patriotic bumper harvest plans. Various localities must universally complete the rectification of mutual aid and cooperation organizations before spring plowing, so that various forms of mutual aid and cooperation organizations can be gradually consolidated and improved in accordance with the principles of voluntary participation, mutual benefit, and steady development. The formulation of patriotic bumper harvest plans must be realistic and form a mass movement from the bottom up. It is necessary to fully deliberate and discuss, tap potential capabilities, and find ways to increase production. There must be sufficient estimates and full prevention preparations for various natural disasters that may be encountered. Oppose paternalism and formalism. Third, the method of organizing the competition. Each province (city) and county should, in accordance with the spirit of the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture's Interim Measures for Bumper Harvest Rewards in 1952, and in combination with the specific local conditions, propose various different competition indicators for different regions, different conditions, and different crop types; pay attention to taking care of areas with poor production conditions, and strengthen leadership over areas with backward production. At the beginning of the competition, first organize several competition groups formed by households, teams, and cooperatives with similar conditions in one district and one township to establish a bumper harvest banner; further carry out mutual competition between households, teams, cooperatives, and individual farmers; and then launch regional competitions between townships and districts. The guiding principle of the competition must be a combination of universally increasing unit area yield and focusing on cultivating bumper harvest models. Fourth, improve agricultural technology. Various localities should, based on advanced production technologies such as deep plowing, close planting, and rational fertilization, combine local arable land natural conditions, and grasp effective production increase links suitable for the locality, and hold various lectures or training courses in different seasons, plan to cultivate and impart technical backbones in large quantities, and combine the establishment of technical transmission stations or promotion networks and other organizations to strengthen agricultural scientific research and guidance, so that the bumper harvest experience of labor models can be combined with science and technology to ensure continued production increase.
    
    The instructions finally emphasized that: The county and district are the basic units for leading the bumper harvest competition, and the party and government leading organs and agricultural departments of the county and district must strengthen the leadership of the key grassroots in the competition. In order to continuously deepen the competition movement and implement it throughout the year, it is necessary to have mobilization, inspection, and summarization. Cadres who lead production must go deep into the fields, deep into the production process, study agricultural technology, learn from the masses of farmers, and concentrate and implement the bumper harvest experience of the masses of farmers. Various localities should launch mass appraisal movements on a quarterly basis, pay attention to correcting the farmers' bias of simply regarding the appraisal as selecting a few models, and achieve the goal of further improving the vast number of farmers in terms of political ideology and production technology through the appraisal.

    中南行政委员会
    发布开展农业爱国增产运动的十项措施
    并指示各地及时做好开展丰产竞赛运动准备工作
    中南行政委员会在六日发布了“关于开展农业爱国增产运动的十项措施”。十项措施为：一、宣布土地改革结束，各阶层人民应即全力转向爱国增产运动。但个别地区土地改革尚未完全结束者，仍应继续完成。二、保护各阶层人民的土地、财产私有权和劳动所得。三、强制地主劳动，其劳动所得同样予以保护；其在土地改革中未经没收的财产，应积极投入生产，不再没收；今后视其守法与自我劳动改造程度，得遵照政务院关于划分农村阶级成分的决定改变其成分。地主如有违法反动行为，一经查实，严惩不贷。四、允许自由雇工，保证借贷自由，工资或利息由双方面议。因劳力缺乏而出租小量土地者，亦应保证其地租所得。五、积极地、稳步地开展互助合作运动，但必须坚持自愿互利原则，严禁强迫命令；切实团结单干农民，不得排斥和歧视。六、实行奖励爱国增产政策，开展农业丰产评比运动。七、贯彻查田定产、依率计征、依法减免的农业税收政策，严禁一切违法摊派、贪污、敲诈、勒索等非法行为。按常年产量定产后，因改善经营而增产的部分不另加负担。查田定产中如有个别偏高现象，允许申请复查，查实后即予改正。八、组织信用合作，加强供销合作，并团结一切有益国计民生的私营工商业，畅通城乡物资交流，推动工农业产品的发展。九、不违农时，统一安排工作，切实精简会议。除人民政府规定的义务劳动外，严禁一切非法派工或浪费民力的行为。一切工作的推行，均不得强迫命令。十、加强农村治安工作，巩固人民民主专政，确保社会秩序的安定。
    又讯：中南行政委员会发布关于开展一九五三年农业爱国丰产竞赛的指示，要求中南区各级人民政府在春耕季节到来前，及时地从思想上、组织上、物质上做好开展爱国丰产竞赛运动的准备工作。今年全区要动员五十万个互助组和农业生产合作社参加竞赛，各地国营农场无例外地都要参加竞赛和在竞赛中起示范带头作用，各地还要注意发动广大的个体农民投入这一运动。
    为了胜利地完成这个任务，指示中提出必须注意做好以下几项工作：首先是加强思想领导的工作。各地要结合今年国家的三大任务，对农民进行爱国丰产和生产政策的宣传教育，帮助农民总结和学习先进生产经验，使农民认识个人与国家的关系，明确爱国丰产在国家大规模建设中的重要性，消除各种思想顾虑。在运动中要善于掌握干部和农民的思想发展规律，特别在运动展开后要防止单纯锦标主义思想的发生，保证运动健康发展。其次是要大力整顿互助合作组织，并切实展开群众性的订立爱国丰产计划运动。各地在春耕前必须普遍地完成互助合作组织的整顿工作，使各种形式的互助合作组织依照自愿、互利的原则和稳步发展的方针，逐步地巩固和提高。订立爱国丰产计划一定要切合实际，并自下而上形成群众性的运动。要经过充分酝酿讨论，挖掘潜在能力，找到增产的门路。对可能遇到的各种自然灾害，要有足够的估计和充分的防治准备。反对包办代替和形式主义。第三是组织竞赛的方法。各省（市）、县都应根据中央人民政府农业部一九五二年丰产奖励暂行办法的精神，结合当地具体情况，就不同地区、不同条件和不同的作物种类，提出各种不同的竞赛指标；注意照顾生产条件较差的地区，并加强对生产落后地区的领导。竞赛开始时，先在一区一乡内组织由条件相近的户、组、社形成几个竞赛集团，树立丰产旗帜；进一步开展户、组、社及个体农民的相互竞赛；然后再发动乡与乡、区与区的地区性竞赛。竞赛的指导方针，必须是普遍提高单位面积产量与重点培养丰产典型相结合。第四是改进农业技术。各地应根据先进生产技术，如深耕、密植、合理施肥等，结合当地耕地自然条件，并抓住适合当地的有效的增产环节，在不同季节开办各种讲习会或训练班，有计划地大量培养传授技术的骨干分子，并结合建立技术传授站或推广网等组织，加强农业科学的研究和指导，使劳动模范的丰产经验与科学技术相结合，以保证继续增产。
    指示最后强调指出：县、区是领导丰产竞赛的基本单位，县、区党政领导机关和农业部门必须加强对竞赛重点的基层领导。为了使竞赛运动不断深入，贯彻全年，必须做到有发动、有检查、有总结。领导生产的干部必须深入田间，深入生产过程，钻研农业技术，向农民群众学习，把农民群众的丰产经验集中起来又贯彻下去。各地要按季展开群众性的评比运动，注意纠正农民对评比单纯看做是选几个模范的偏向，达到通过评比使广大农民在政治思想、生产技术各方面进一步提高。    　（新华社）
