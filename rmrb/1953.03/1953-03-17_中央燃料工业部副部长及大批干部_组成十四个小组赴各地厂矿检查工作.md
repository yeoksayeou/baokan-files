The Central Fuel Industry Ministry has selected over 200 cadres, led by Vice Ministers Liu Lanbo and Xu Daben, to form 14 inspection groups to conduct in-depth work inspections at key factories and mines.

The inspection groups include ten individuals comprised of Directors and Deputy Directors of departments, as well as Directors and Deputy Directors of various general administrative bureaus. Soviet experts from the Fuel Industry Ministry have also participated. Of the fourteen inspection groups, five are coal mine inspection groups, four are electricity industry inspection groups, and five are petroleum inspection groups. These inspection groups will go to Fushun, Fuxin, Jixi, Huadian, Dalian, and Jinxi in the Northeast; Datong, Fengfeng, Jingxi, Shijingshan, Taiyuan, and Tianjin in North China; Shandong, Huainan, and Shanghai in East China; Zhengzhou, Xiangzhong, Daye, and Chongqing in Central and Southwest China; and Yanchang, Silangmiao, and Laojunmiao in the Northwest. Based on the characteristics of the various industries under the Fuel Industry Ministry, the inspection groups also have specialized groups for equipment supply, financial costing, geological exploration, and safe operation.

Adhering to the principle of focusing on key inspections and resolving crucial issues, the inspections will focus on key areas and typical problems in coal, electricity, and petroleum. For example, the drilling issue in the coal mining industry will focus on Fuxin, Fengfeng, and Jingxi; the coal quality issue will focus on Shandong, Huainan, and Fushun. In the electricity industry, the Central South region will focus on resolving design and construction techniques, as well as design quality and construction strength. In East China, the focus will be on helping to improve design institutions. Safe power transmission issues will primarily focus on Beijing. In addition to mobilizing the masses to discuss plans and inspect new well projects, the petroleum industry will also inspect serious violations of law and discipline in some factories and mines.

Vice Minister Liu Lanbo requested that all factories and mines establish a system for inspection work in the future, conducting regular inspections instead of treating it as a crash campaign. He also requested that the inspection group staff adopt a humble attitude and conscientiously assist in solving problems at the grassroots level.

    组成十四个小组赴各地厂矿检查工作
    中央燃料工业部抽调了二百余名干部，在副部长刘澜波、徐达本领导下，组成十四个检查组，分赴各重点厂矿深入检查工作。
    检查组包括正副司长及各管理总局正副局长十人，燃料工业部的苏联专家们也参加了。十四个检查组中，有煤矿检查组五个，电业检查组四个、石油检查组五个。这些检查组将分赴东北的抚顺、阜新、鸡西、桦甸、大连、锦西，华北的大同、峰峰、京西、石景山、太原、天津，华东的山东、淮南、上海，中南和西南的郑州、湘中、大冶、重庆，西北的延长、四郎庙、老君庙等处。根据燃料工业部所属各产业的特点，检查组中还另有器材供应、财务成本、地质探勘、安全运行等专业组。
    根据重点检查和解决关键问题的原则，在煤、电、石油各方面将选择重点区域和典型问题进行检查，如煤矿工业的钻探问题将以阜新、峰峰、京西为重点；煤的质量问题以山东、淮南、抚顺为重点。电力工业在中南区以解决设计与施工技术及设计质量、施工力量为主，在华东区着重帮助健全设计机构；安全发送电问题将以北京为主。石油工业除动员群众讨论计划和检查新井工程外，将要检查某些厂矿的严重违法乱纪行为。
    刘澜波副部长要求各厂矿今后把检查工作形成制度，经常进行检查，而不应当成突击工作，并要求检查组的工作人员抱着谦虚的态度，认真负责地协助下面解决问题。
