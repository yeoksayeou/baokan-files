In order to examine the handling of people's letters and promote the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Second Report Meeting on Handling People's Letters from March 1st to 5th. More than 20 cadres in charge of this work from the Mengsui Sub-bureau, provincial Party committees, municipal Party committees, the Inner Mongolia Eastern District Party Committee, and some prefectural Party committees and provincial-level municipal Party committees attended the meeting.

According to reports from various regions, since the North China Bureau convened the meeting on handling people's letters in November 1952, especially after the Central Committee issued instructions on opposing bureaucracy, opposing commandism, and opposing violations of law and discipline in January this year, leading organs above the prefectural and municipal Party committees in the entire region have attached greater importance to the work of handling people's letters, and there has been significant improvement. The main manifestations are the enrichment of the institutions for handling people's letters, the establishment of systems, and the improvement of processing speed. In Tianjin, the number of cadres managing people's letters at all levels of districts and units was 132 last year, and it has increased to 214 this year (including 100 full-time cadres); the number of cadres handling people's letters in provincial and municipal level organs in Hebei Province and some units in Mengsui has also increased compared with the past. Hebei and Shanxi have both stipulated that leading comrades at all levels should directly handle important letters, meet with visiting masses, and organize relevant departments to conduct regular contact. Many municipal-level organs have been able to process 60% to 80% of the letters received during the same period within ten days. After Hebei Province handled the Taidi Village case, the number of people's letters and visits surged. According to statistics from the General Office of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate and other units, the number of letters received in 50 days was equivalent to three times the total number of letters received in the second half of last year. Provincial-level organs were once overwhelmed. Since November last year, the people's letters received by leading organs in various regions have not only increased in quantity, but also shown the following characteristics: First, the proportion of letters directly from the masses and those forwarded by higher-level organs in each province and city has changed significantly, with the former increasing and the latter relatively decreasing. Last year, only 25% of the letters received directly by the Cangzhou Prefectural Party Committee were from the masses, and the rest were forwarded by higher-level organs; of the 107 letters received this year, 89% were directly from the masses. Second, the number of anonymous letters is gradually decreasing. The Fourth Branch of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau received 50% anonymous letters in the second half of last year, 18% in January this year, and only 10% in February. Third, the proportion of letters exposing violations of law and discipline by grassroots cadres is gradually increasing. Since December last year, the General Office of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee has received 236 letters, of which 44% belong to this category. The general proportion in various places is more than 25%. This greatly facilitates the leading organs to understand the situation below and eliminate bad people and bad deeds.

At the same time, the meeting also reflected the very uneven development of the work of handling people's letters. To date, some regions and units still do not attach importance to people's letters. This phenomenon is more serious in enterprise departments and county and district-level organs. Xie Guangde (female) of the Locomotive Section of the Taiyuan Railway Administration wrote 120 letters to relevant leading organs to reflect the problems of the agency, but so far no agency has come forward to solve the problems. The Zhangjiakou Municipal Party Committee inspected 104 units and found that 46 units had not set up suggestion boxes. Some units (such as Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory, etc.) have set up suggestion boxes, but no one cares about the letters that have been moldy in the boxes. Some district and village cadres in Daming County, Hebei Province, even prevent the masses from reading newspapers carrying the Taidi Village incident. The reasons for the above-mentioned phenomena are mainly that some leading cadres do not care about the suffering of the masses, are blindly complacent and content with their work; and there are sectarian sentiments of appeasement and protection for cadres. The cadres attending the meeting finally unanimously agreed that the following aspects of the work of handling people's letters should be focused on in the future:

First, leading organs at all levels in the region should generally clean up the backlog of people's letters in the near future, and sort them out for processing according to the nature, severity and urgency of the problems. Second, the Party Committee should continue to strengthen leadership, supervision and inspection of this work. However, strengthening the leadership of the Party Committee does not mean that the Party Committee should take care of everything. All people's letters, except for major cases, should be transferred to relevant business departments for processing, so as to combine unified leadership with division of labor and processing. Third, handling typical bad people and bad deeds is an important method to promote this work. All regions should embody policies through living people and living things, show the attitude of the Party and the People's Government towards bad people and bad deeds, so as to mobilize the masses and throw themselves into the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism and violations of law and discipline. When starting to select typical cases for handling, special attention should be paid to typical cases of suppressing criticism, a large backlog of people's letters, refusal to handle people's letters or making false reports. Fourth, the situation in which the masses have to "travel thousands of miles to Beijing" to expose bad people and bad deeds must be changed. This requires special attention to vigorously promoting the serious handling of people's letters by county-level leading organs. Make the people truly realize that not only is there truth in Beijing, but there is truth everywhere in the areas under the leadership of the Communist Party, and problems can be solved everywhere.

    华北区地委、市委以上领导机关处理人民来信工作有显著改进
    企业部门与县区级机关还未普遍重视要注意纠正
    为检查处理人民来信的情况，推动反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争，中共中央华北局于三月一日至五日召开了第二次处理人民来信工作汇报会议，到会的有蒙绥分局、各省委、市委、内蒙东部区党委及一部分地委、省辖市委等主管此项工作的干部共二十余人。
    据各地汇报，自一九五二年十一月华北局召开处理人民来信工作会议后，特别是今年一月中央发出关于反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的指示后，全区地委、市委级以上领导机关，对处理人民来信工作，已更加重视，并有显著改进。主要表现在充实了处理人民来信的机构，建立了制度和提高了处理速度。天津市、区两级各单位管理人民来信的干部，去年为一百三十二人，今年增至二百一十四人（内专职干部一百人）；河北省、市级机关及蒙绥有些单位，处理人民来信的干部，也较前增加了。河北、山西均规定各级负责同志直接批办重要信件、接见来访群众以及组织有关部门定期联系等制度。很多市级机关，已能在十天内处理完同期来信的百分之六十至八十。河北省处理了台底村案件后，人民来信、来访数量激增，仅据河北省委办公厅和河北省人民检察署等单位统计，五十天的来信相当于去年后半年来信总和的三倍。省级机关一度门庭若市。从去年十一月以来，各地领导机关收到的人民来信不仅在数量上日有增加，同时还表现出如下特点：一、各省、市直接来自群众的信件和由上级转去的，二者的比重发生了显著变化，前者增加，后者相对减少。沧州地委去年直接收到的群众来信，仅占全部处理信件的百分之二十五，其余都是上级机关转去的；在今年收到的一百零七件信中，群众直接来信已占百分之八十九。二、匿名信日渐减少。天津市公安四分局去年下半年收到的匿名信占全部来信的百分之五十，今年一月份为百分之十八，二月份仅占百分之十。三、揭发基层干部违法乱纪的信件，比重逐渐增加。河北省委办公厅，自去年十二月迄今，收到二百三十六件来信，其中属于此类性质者占百分之四十四。各地一般均占百分之二十五以上。这就大大便利了领导机关了解下情，肃清坏人坏事。
    同时，会议还反映了处理人民来信工作开展很不平衡的情况。迄今有些地区和单位仍不重视人民来信。这种现象在企业部门和县、区级机关比较严重。太原铁路管理局机务段谢广德（女）为反映该机关的问题，先后向有关领导机关写了一百二十封信，至今没有一个机关出面解决。张家口市委检查了一百零四个单位，发现有四十六个单位未设置意见箱。有些单位（如张家口纸烟厂等）虽设意见箱，但信件在箱内霉烂了仍无人过问。河北省大名县有些区、村干部，竟不让群众看载有台底村事件的报纸。发生上述现象的原因，主要是某些领导干部对群众疾苦不关心，对工作盲目自满、自安；对干部则存在着姑息、包庇的宗派情绪所致。与会干部最后一致认为：处理人民来信今后应着重做好以下几方面的工作：
    一、全区各级领导机关，在最近期间普遍清理一次积压的人民来信，并根据问题性质及轻重缓急，进行排队处理。二、党委对此项工作要继续加强领导、督促和检查。但加强党委领导不是党委包办。所有人民来信，除重大案件外，应转有关业务部门处理，使统一领导与分工处理相结合。三、处理典型的坏人坏事，乃是推动此项工作的重要方法。各地均应通过活人活事体现政策，表明党和人民政府对坏人坏事的态度，从而动员群众，投入反对官僚主义、反对命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争。在开始选择典型进行处理时，目前应特别注意压制批评、大量积压人民来信、对人民来信拒不处理或作假报告的典型。四、各地群众为揭发坏人坏事不得不“千里迢迢进北京”的情况，必须予以改变。这就须要特别注意大力推动县级领导机关认真处理人民来信。使人民群众真正体会到不仅北京有真理，只要在共产党领导下的地区处处都有真理，处处都能解决问题。
