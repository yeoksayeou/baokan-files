The Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, No. 9, 1953, has been published.

This issue publishes at great length the new evidence of the United States' germ warfare in Korea – the full text of three confessions by American prisoner of war F. Schwable and the confession of another American prisoner of war, R. Bleigh, and published an editorial entitled "Documents Exposing Germ Warfare Criminals." The editorial stated: These confessions provide more evidence to the large amount of facts that had been determined as early as the beginning of 1952 regarding the bacteriological warfare waged by the American misanthropes against Korea and China. These facts powerfully expose the long-term plans, strategies, and tactics of the germ warfare launched by the American imperialists, and once again reveal to the world that the rulers of the United States are the mortal enemies of peace and the irreconcilable enemies of the people of all countries. The editorial pointed out: The American officers' confessions about the sinister conspiracy to exterminate humanity and the execution of these conspiracies have touched the conscience of progressive people in all countries. Peace-loving people are demanding an end to the Korean War. They must have the power to stop the germ warfare criminals.

This issue publishes an article by Roman Zambrowski, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, entitled "Criticism and Self-Criticism – The Driving Force of Socialist Construction in People's Poland," which states: The achievements of People's Poland in socialist construction are great and multifaceted. Among the many keys that promote the rapid development of People's Poland, criticism and self-criticism play a special role. It is a time-tested weapon for providing communist training to cadres, consolidating their ties with the masses, and a powerful driving force of our people's democratic society. Zambrowski emphasized: The greater the victory of socialist construction, the more ferocious the resistance of all enemies of the people, and the more cunning and despicable the methods they adopt to oppose the people's regime. Under these circumstances, the most dangerous thing for us is that, under the influence of our construction achievements, our cadres may become politically blind and may develop complacency and self-satisfaction. Under these circumstances, our progress towards socialism largely depends on the firm attitude of party organizations and cadres in using criticism and self-criticism in the struggle against shortcomings and weaknesses. Therefore, it is particularly important to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, cultivate among the working masses a sense of being the masters of their country, attract them to participate in the management of the country, and widely use criticism and self-criticism. Party branches and party activists must regard criticism and self-criticism as an organic and inseparable part of party life and as a basic method of party work.

This issue also published Harold J. Brown's American correspondence: "Who Rules America." In the correspondence, Brown analyzed in detail the composition of the Eisenhower government in the United States. He pointed out that the new US government is essentially composed of direct representatives of the major US monopoly capitalist groups, and that it is the first time in American history that big capitalists have so openly and on such a large scale abandoned their agents - professional politicians - and personally assumed important government positions. Some of the steps taken by the new US government after taking office indicate that it intends to solve economic and political difficulties by expanding imperialist aggression. Brown emphasized: Today, millions of Americans who voted for the Republicans based on their promise to end the Korean War have realized that they have been deceived; they are beginning to see that the new government threatens to expand the war in the Far East, further lower living standards, and infringe on democratic rights. The American people are increasingly aware that only by forming the broadest democratic front can they thwart the conspiracies of the "general staff" of monopoly capital and reactionaries, and only such a front can save our country from the threat of war and fascism.

This issue also published John Gibbons' book review: "Britain Under the Feet of American 'Friends'," which reviews the book "America Dominates Britain" written by Phil Piratin, a reporter for the British Daily Worker. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第九期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第九期已经出版。
    本期以巨大篇幅刊载了美国在朝鲜进行细菌战争的新证据——美国战俘弗·许威布尔三个供词和另一美国战俘罗·布莱的供词的全文，并发表了题为“揭露细菌战罪犯的文件”的社论。社论说：这些供词给远在一九五二年初即已确定了的关于美国仇恨人类者对朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的大量事实提供了更多的证据。这些事实有力地揭露了美帝国主义者所发动的细菌战的长远计划、战略与战术，再次向全世界揭露出：美国的统治者是和平的死敌，各国人民的不共戴天的仇人。社论指出：美国军官关于灭绝人类的险恶阴谋和关于执行这些阴谋的供词，触动了各国进步人民的良心。爱好和平的人民都要求结束朝鲜战争。他们一定有力量制止细菌战罪犯。
    本期刊载了波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记罗·萨姆布罗夫斯基的题为“批评和自我批评——人民波兰社会主义建设的原动力”的文章说：人民波兰在社会主义建设中获得的成就是伟大的、多方面的。在推动人民波兰迅速发展的许多关键中，批评和自我批评起着特殊的作用，它是给予干部以共产主义训练、巩固他们与群众的联系的久经考验的武器，是我们人民民主社会的强有力的原动力。萨姆布罗夫斯基强调说：社会主义建设的胜利越大，人民的一切敌人的抵抗也就越凶恶，他们采取的反人民政权的方法也就越狡猾、越卑鄙。在这些情况下，对于我们最危险的事情就是，在我们建设成就的影响之下，我们的干部可能在政治上变得盲目，可能产生自满和沾沾自喜的情绪。在这些情况下，我们向社会主义的迈进，在很大程度上要看党组织和干部在反对缺点和弱点的斗争中运用批评和自我批评的坚决态度而定。因此，进行反对官僚主义的斗争，在劳动群众中培养他们的国家主人翁的感觉，吸引他们参加管理国家的工作，广泛地运用批评和自我批评是特别重要的。党支部和党的活动分子必须把批评和自我批评看作党生活的有机和不可分割的一部分，看作党工作的基本方法。
    本期还发表了赫劳利德·布·布朗的美国通讯：“谁统治美国”。布朗在通讯中详细地分析了美国艾森豪威尔政府的组成成分。他指出：美国新政府实质上是美国各主要垄断资本集团的直接代表人物所组成的，大资本家这样公开地、大规模地抛弃了他们的代理人——职业政客——而亲自担任政府的要职，这在美国历史上要算第一次。美国新政府上台后所采取的一些步骤，表明了它打算用扩大帝国主义侵略的办法来解决经济困难和政治困难。布朗强调说：今天，成百万根据共和党人的关于结束朝鲜战争的诺言而投票选举了他们的美国人，已经觉悟到，他们是被欺骗了；他们开始看到，新政府威胁着要扩大在远东的战争，要进一步降低生活水平，侵犯民主权利。美国人民日益觉悟到，只有组成最广泛的民主阵线才能挫败垄断资本和反动派的“总参谋部”的阴谋，只有这样一个阵线才能拯救我国免于战祸和法西斯主义的威胁。
    本期还发表了约翰·吉本斯的书评：“在美国‘朋友’脚下的英国”，评论英国工人日报记者菲·波尔索维尔写的“美国驾御着英国”一书。  （新华社）
