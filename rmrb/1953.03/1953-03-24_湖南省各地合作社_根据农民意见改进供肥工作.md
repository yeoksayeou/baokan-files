    Hunan Province Cooperatives
    Improve Fertilizer Supply Work Based on Farmers' Opinions
    After the Hunan Provincial People's Government Cooperative Affairs Bureau improved fertilizer supply work based on the opinions of farmers, most counties have achieved results in fertilizer supply work. The province has completed 65.8 percent of its fertilizer supply plan, with only Qianyang and Shaoyang prefectures doing poorly in their respective counties.
    In the previous period, the supply and marketing cooperatives in Hunan Province had significant shortcomings in their fertilizer supply work. For example, some supply and marketing cooperatives did not start from the actual needs of local farmers when planning and allocating fertilizers, and did not actively organize local oil mills and kiln owners to process and produce. As a result, the bean cake fertilizer and miscellaneous fertilizers such as lime and ferrous sulfate that farmers were accustomed to using were not supplied by the cooperatives, while many fertilizers that local farmers did not need were allocated. Therefore, this aroused dissatisfaction among farmers in various places, who wrote letters criticizing and suggesting improvements to the cooperative's fertilizer supply work.
    After receiving the letters from the farmers, the Hunan Provincial People's Government Cooperative Affairs Bureau immediately instructed cooperative administrative organs and cooperatives at all levels to conduct inspections, and determined that future fertilizer supply work should strengthen investigation and research, local purchasing, and local processing, fully utilize raw materials produced within the province, and vigorously open up fertilizer sources to ensure timely supply. The Xiangtan Prefectural Cooperative Union sent special personnel to various counties to supervise and inspect, and put forward improvement measures in response to the shortcomings in the work, established production sections in the supply and marketing cooperatives of various counties, and equipped them with full-time cadres to manage the fertilizer supply work. One cadre was transferred from each grassroots cooperative to participate in agricultural technology training classes. The Third District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Pingjiang County also sent cadres deep into the countryside to investigate the fertilizers needed by local farmers and help farmers formulate fertilizer purchase plans household by household. Then, the cooperative, together with the local People's Bank of China branch, signed a triangular contract with each township. The cooperative guaranteed the supply of fertilizer according to the plan, the bank branch cooperated with the fertilizer distribution by issuing loans, and the farmers in each township bought fertilizer according to the plan, which made the farmers very satisfied.
    The supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas also corrected the idea of not fully utilizing and developing local fertilizer sources but simply relying on the allocation of fertilizers from superior cooperatives. The Changde Area Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased cotton seed cakes that local farmers used as firewood as fertilizer, enriching the fertilizer sources. Currently, the Changde Prefectural Cooperative has completed 95.8 percent of its fertilizer supply plan. In order to solve the fertilizer shortage problem, the Liuyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative convened local public and private lime kiln owners to form a lime fertilizer production cooperative committee, using labor as shares to order lime or exchanging firewood for lime, so that the difficulties of manpower and materials were solved.

### 湖南省各地合作社  根据农民意见改进供肥工作

    湖南省各地合作社
    根据农民意见改进供肥工作
    湖南省人民政府合作事业管理局根据农民群众意见，改进肥料供应工作后，大部县供肥工作已有成绩。全省已完成供肥计划百分之六十五点八，只有黔阳、邵阳两专区各县仍做得很差。
    在前一个时期，湖南各地供销合作社在供应肥料工作中存在很大缺点，如部分供销合作社在计划和调拨肥料时，不从当地农民的实际需要出发，不积极组织当地榨坊、窑户加工生产。如农民群众习惯使用的枯饼肥料及石灰、青矾等杂肥，合作社供应不上，而调拨了许多当地农民群众不需要的肥料。因此，引起各地农民不满，纷纷来信对合作社供应肥料工作提出批评和建议。
    湖南省人民政府合作事业管理局接到农民群众的来信后，立即指示各级合作行政管理机关和合作社进行检查，并确定以后在供肥工作中要加强调查研究，就地收购，就地加工，充分利用省内出产的原料，大力开辟肥料来源，及时做好供应工作。湘潭专区合作社联合社为此派专人赴各县进行督促检查，并针对工作中的缺点提出改进办法，在各县供销合作社建立生产股，配备专职干部掌握肥料供应工作。从每个基层合作社抽调一个干部参加农业技术训练班学习。平江县第三区供销合作社还派出干部深入农村，调查当地农民群众所需肥料，帮助农民逐户订好购肥计划。然后由合作社会同当地人民银行营业所与各乡订立三角合同。合作社根据计划保证供应肥料，银行营业所配合供肥发放贷款，各乡农民群众照计划买肥料，这样，使农民感到非常满意。
    有些地区的供销合作社并纠正不充分利用和开辟当地的肥料来源而单纯依赖上级社调配的思想。常德地区供销合作社收购了当地农民作为柴烧的棉枯饼作肥料，丰富了肥料的来源。现常德专区合作社已完成供肥计划百分之九十五点八。浏阳县供销合作社为了解决缺肥问题，召集当地公私营石灰窑户开会，成立石灰肥料生产合作委员会，以人工入股订购石灰或以柴换灰，使人力物力的困难都得到解决。
