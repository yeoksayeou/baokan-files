Turning Grief into Strength, Intensifying the Struggle to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea

The great Stalin was a champion of world peace, a mentor and friend of people of all countries striving for peace, democracy, and independence. His death is an immeasurable loss not only to the Soviet people but also to the Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world. However, the Chinese people, like all peace-loving people around the world, are turning grief into strength, uniting more closely around the Soviet Union—the bulwark of world peace—and, as Chairman Mao's telegram of condolence stated, "undertaking the sacred cause of defending world peace in the direction indicated by Comrade Stalin."

The heroic struggle of the Chinese people to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the just war waged by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army side by side against the U.S. aggressors, has already made a significant contribution to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world. In the future, we will continue to fight unremittingly, determined to smash any adventurous actions by the U.S. aggressors to expand the war, in order to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. The great struggle and brilliant victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples against the U.S. aggressors have proven, and will continue to prove, that with the increasing strength of the Soviet Union—the bulwark of world peace—and the consolidation and development of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, the Chinese and Korean peoples are forever invincible, and the defeat of the U.S. aggressors is destined.

In the victorious struggle against the U.S. aggressors, the Chinese and Korean peoples have received the deep sympathy and concern of Comrade Stalin, and the strong support of the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet government under the leadership of Comrade Stalin. In his speech on February 16, 1951, Comrade Stalin relentlessly exposed the injustice of the war waged by the U.S. aggressors and their international accomplices in Korea, and condemned the shameful decision of the United Nations to accuse the People's Republic of China of being an "aggressor." He also pointed out that if the United States and Britain refused the peaceful proposals of the Government of the People's Republic of China, then the Korean War could only end in the failure of the interventionists. The Soviet government delegation at the United Nations meetings has consistently and solemnly opposed the various illegal activities of the U.S. aggressors in using the United Nations to conduct and expand the war of aggression against Korea, and at the same time has repeatedly put forward fair and reasonable peace proposals in order to achieve a ceasefire in Korea and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Just as in all international activities to defend world peace, Comrade Stalin's voice of peace and justice on the Korean issue, and the Soviet government's vigorous actions to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, have had a tremendous international impact, won the support of peace-loving people all over the world, and dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors.

Now, in order to maintain the bloody profits of the billionaires, and for the dirty cause of enslaving Asia and dominating the world, the U.S. government has brazenly continued to refuse a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and openly clamors to expand the war to China and the entire Asia. This handful of vicious and cowardly blood-sucking devils are gloating over Comrade Stalin's death, vainly hoping to find any exploitable opportunities for their desperate and sinful plans. However, this is an impossible dream. The doctrine of Lenin and Stalin has already achieved great victories in the liberation cause of the Asian people, has illuminated the path of the Asian people, and will continue to arm the Asian people who are heroically fighting for peace, freedom, and independence. The tested and incomparably strong Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government will receive the consistent trust and support of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world. The world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union will be further consolidated and developed. The development of the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance has been, is, and will continue to be a strong guarantee for peace in the Far East and the world. Under all these circumstances, the Chinese and Korean peoples and the Asian people will unite more closely, and have the firm confidence and sufficient strength to give the U.S. aggressors who dare to take risks a crushing blow.

    化悲痛为力量，加强抗美援朝斗争
    伟大的斯大林，是世界和平的旗手，是争取和平民主独立的各国人民的导师和朋友。他的逝世，不仅是苏联人民而且也是中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的不可估量的损失。但是，中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一样，正在化悲痛为力量，更紧密地团结在苏联——世界和平堡垒的周围，像毛主席唁电中所说的，“遵循斯大林同志指示的方向，把保卫世界和平的神圣事业担当起来。”
    中国人民英勇地进行的抗美援朝斗争，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩抵抗美国侵略者的正义战争，已对远东和世界和平事业作了重大的贡献；今后仍将奋斗不息，决心使美国侵略者扩大战争的任何冒险行动受到粉碎性的打击，以维护远东及世界和平。中朝人民反对美国侵略者的伟大斗争及辉煌胜利，已经证明了，而且将来还要继续证明：在苏联——世界和平堡垒的日益坚强和以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的巩固和发展的情况下，中朝人民是永远不可战胜的，美国侵略者的失败是注定了的。
    中朝人民在胜利地进行反对美国侵略者的斗争中，得到了斯大林同志的深切同情和关怀，得到了在斯大林同志领导下的苏联政府的和平外交政策的有力支持。斯大林同志在一九五一年二月十六日发表的谈话中，曾无情地揭露了美国侵略者和它的国际帮凶在朝鲜进行的战争的非正义性，斥责联合国诬指中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的可耻决定；他并指出：美国和英国如果拒绝中华人民共和国政府的和平建议，那么朝鲜战争只能以干涉者的失败而告终。苏联政府代表团在联合国会议上始终严正地反对美国侵略者利用联合国进行和扩大侵朝战争的种种非法活动，同时一再提出公平合理的和平建议，以求实现朝鲜停战，及和平解决朝鲜问题。正如在保卫世界和平的全部国际活动中一样，斯大林同志在朝鲜问题上所发出的和平正义声音，苏联政府力求和平解决朝鲜问题的有力行动，都产生了巨大的国际影响，获得了全世界爱好和平人民的拥护，使美国侵略者遭受到沉重的打击。
    现在，美国政府为了保持亿万富翁们的血腥利润，为了奴役亚洲和独霸世界的肮脏事业，悍然地继续拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，并公然叫嚣要把战争扩大到中国和整个亚洲。这一小撮凶恶而又卑怯的喝血魔鬼们，正在因斯大林同志的逝世而幸灾乐祸，妄想给他们绝望的罪恶计划找到任何一点可乘的机会。然而，这是永远不可能实现的梦想。列宁斯大林的学说，已经在亚洲人民的解放事业中获得了伟大的胜利，已经照亮了亚洲人民的道路，并将继续武装着为争取和平自由独立而英勇斗争的亚洲人民。久经考验的无比坚强的苏联共产党和苏联政府将得到中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民的始终如一的信任和支持。以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营将进一步巩固和发展起来。中苏两国友好同盟的发展，过去是、现在是、将来仍是远东和世界和平的有力保障。在这一切的情况下，中朝人民和亚洲人民将更紧密地团结起来，并有坚定的信心和足够的力量，给敢于冒险的美国侵略者以粉碎性的打击。
