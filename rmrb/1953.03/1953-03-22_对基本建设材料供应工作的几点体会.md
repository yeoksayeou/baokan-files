As the director of the basic construction materials section of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, I would like to share some experiences in basic construction material supply work.

In the past year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has encountered many difficulties in the technical supply of basic construction materials, such as unfamiliarity with the business, insufficient personnel, and difficulty in sourcing materials. However, thanks to the material supply staff's clear understanding of serving the project and facing the site, and by taking the initiative to secure supplies in the absence of pre-defined material standards and specifications, we have initially established some management systems that have basically guaranteed supply, creating favorable conditions for smooth construction.

In the total investment in basic construction, material costs account for a large proportion. Generally, building materials account for 64% of the total investment in housing and warehouses, 31.9% in factory renovations, and 35% in new factories. Therefore, if there is no enterprise-based management system in material supply management, and if material supply management personnel do not have a clear understanding of economic accounting, it will lead to serious waste. More importantly, if the planning is incorrect and the supply is not timely, it will lead to work stoppages and delays, affecting the progress of the project; if the technical specifications and quality are not taken into account in purchasing, ordering, and storage, it will affect the quality of the project. In short, raw material technical supply work is related to the "good, fast, and economical" aspects of the project and directly affects the speed of national basic construction. Therefore, doing a good job in material supply and management in basic construction is a very important issue.

	I. Organizational Division of Labor in Material Management

In large-scale basic construction, to complete the supply of a huge quantity and variety of materials, there must first be a complete organizational structure, clarifying the business scope of each department and closely cooperating with each other. When the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Basic Construction Material Section was first established, it only had three sections: planning, materials, and purchasing and transportation. Moreover, these three sections were not connected in terms of business, and the leading cadres had no clear idea about material supply. In August last year, all basic construction units of Anshan Iron and Steel Company comprehensively launched a responsibility system establishment campaign. According to the opinions of the masses and the instructions of the company leaders, the Basic Construction Material Section first changed its original organizational structure: it strengthened the planning section, abolished the purchasing and transportation and material sections, and established three specialized sections: metal (including steel, non-ferrous metals, and hardware accessories), electromechanical (including electrical, tools, and instruments), and chemical (including rubber, oils, sundries, and medicines). Then, the business scope of each section was clarified; it was stipulated that the planning section was responsible for preparing annual, quarterly, and monthly material supply plans, grasping the distribution of materials, mastering monthly inventory statistics, and sending representatives to major construction areas to understand the actual needs and consumption of the project, and making a monthly procurement plan to be submitted to each specialized section. The specialized sections were responsible for purchasing, transporting, and wholesaling according to the plan, taking monthly inventory, and informing the planning section of the results. In this way, professional division of labor and mutual connection were achieved, initially overcoming the phenomenon of the leadership having no clear idea in the past.

	II. Several Basic Systems in Material Management

	1. Correctly grasp the plan and achieve planned supply. In the past year, materials balanced by the state accounted for 52% of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's materials, and domestic and foreign processing orders accounted for 50% of the total materials. Without correct planning for these materials, it would not only affect the national economic construction plan, but also cause the project to stop and wait for materials. In the past year, our material supply planning was very poor. Construction units often submitted plans with one hand and demanded materials with the other. The maximum number of additions and changes in a single day reached seventeen. During the state balancing period, they could not provide accurate figures, and they requested additions after the balancing period; or they proposed excessively large figures during the balancing, which could not be used after being transported back, directly affecting the turnover of state funds. In order to change this unreasonable phenomenon, the planning nature of material supply must be emphasized, and blindness must be overcome. We decided that from January 1953, engineering companies must submit plans on a monthly basis and sign material supply contracts on a quarterly basis. At the same time, engineering companies must also sign contracts with construction teams.

	2. Strictly implement the inventory and return of materials system to ensure that national investment is used effectively, to avoid waste in the project, and to speed up the turnover of working capital. Anshan Iron and Steel Company has done very poorly in this regard in the past. Some units have no clear idea of material inventory; some take materials and stockpile them in warehouses without using them; some units cannot find sources of materials; at the exchange meeting of backlog materials of each engineering company held in October last year, 2 billion yuan worth of materials were mutually adjusted. Without a material return system, not only will funds be tied up, but more seriously, off-book materials will be generated. According to preliminary statistics, off-book materials reached 13.2 billion yuan last year, and the cost is therefore also incorrect. Experience tells us that inventory and return of materials is one of the most important regular tasks of the material department and must be thoroughly implemented from top to bottom. In principle, work teams cannot have inventory, and even if the construction site is dispersed, a system of returning materials every three days must be implemented: construction areas and sections cannot have inventory, and larger or more remote sections and highly mobile construction teams can have a certain amount of reserves, but they must also conduct an inventory and return of materials every half month. After the project is completed, all materials (including used tools and depreciated materials) should be returned; if they are still in use, the physical objects will not be returned, but bookkeeping return of materials transfer procedures must be carried out. Construction sites must submit accurate inventory reports to the engineering company every month, engineering companies must submit inventory reports to the Basic Construction Material Section by the 5th of each month, and the Material Section must submit accurate inventory reports to the Ministry of Industry every quarter. The inventory stock report should also indicate backlogs and slow-moving items so that the state can uniformly adjust them.

	3. One-time acceptance system and direct delivery to construction sites for raw materials: The types of basic construction materials are as many as 15,000, and the quantity of each type is as high as tens of thousands of tons or tens of thousands of pieces. Without a scientific acceptance system, it will not only affect the quality of the project, but also cause waste and delay the supply time. In the past, a material often underwent acceptance more than three times from purchase to use, but when it arrived at the construction site, it still did not meet the project requirements. The reason is that the more procedures, the fewer people are responsible. Since September last year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Basic Construction Material Section has gradually adopted a one-time acceptance system, that is, after the purchasing personnel have inspected the goods, the warehouse sends someone to the site for acceptance. This not only saves time and speeds up the supply, but also clarifies responsibilities. For bulk special materials, such as bricks, tiles, cement, and standard-sized timber, we try to adopt the method of direct delivery to the construction site to avoid repeated transportation and multiple loading and unloading, which wastes manpower and consumes materials. To this end, each construction site must determine the material work area before construction, prepare warehouses, loading and unloading tools and equipment; the material supply department must notify the construction site warehouse when shipping, and pay for the materials after they are put into the warehouse. This is an important method to ensure timely supply and avoid losses.

	4. Strengthening the management of raw material consumption quotas is a necessary measure to correctly calculate project costs and reduce project costs, and is a concrete method to implement the economic accounting system. The technical supply department should make correct supply plans according to the quota standards stipulated by the state; the work area should set up a material consumption recorder to record the daily project progress and the materials consumed; each month, compare the actual consumption with the quota to analyze the reasons for exceeding the quota and reducing the quota, discover advanced methods, and commend and reward them and promote them among the masses; for those who exceed the quota, economic accounting system education should be carried out in a timely manner.

Auxiliary materials such as wooden scaffolding for handovers, temporary wires used at construction sites, and box boards used for concrete are not materials consumed by a single project. When distributing such materials, it is necessary to follow the quota, and when there is no quota, it is also necessary to make a plan based on actual needs, and depreciation must be carried out in accordance with the turnover plan stipulated by the higher authorities when using them.

The construction tools required for basic construction projects are as many as thousands, and their cost accounts for 5% of the material cost. Whether the tools are stored and used reasonably has a significant impact on reducing project costs and ensuring project speed. In particular, mechanical installation relies mainly on tools to complete. Both the material supply department and the construction site should have a tool warehouse organization to be specifically responsible for formulating tool usage plans, applying for distribution, and storage. The construction site engineering team should set up a tool room; each tool should have special storage methods, and tool usage consumption quotas should be set according to different types of work. The supply of tools should be based on the work team, and tool usage cards should be set up in the work team to record the year and month of receipt, the name of the custodian, the period of use, and the storage and use methods; the material supply leading authority should conduct regular inspections. Tools must also be depreciated according to the usage quota to be included in the project cost in stages.

In order to continuously reduce the material consumption quota, it is necessary to constantly educate the masses on the idea of economic accounting, constantly solicit opinions from the masses, improve quota conditions, and determine new advanced quotas.

	III. Warehouse Work

The organization of the warehouse should be determined according to the quantity and nature of the materials. In order to facilitate supply and management, under the leadership of the general warehouse, we established thirteen sub-warehouses to manage various types of materials; in addition, we also established a waste product regeneration warehouse. The waste product regeneration warehouse is equipped with small lathes, vises, and other mechanical equipment to be responsible for recovering waste materials from construction sites, and reusing them after processing. According to preliminary calculations, the above-mentioned waste materials recovered by Anshan Iron and Steel Company last year reached 6 billion yuan. If material supply authorities at all levels can attach importance to this work, they will save a lot of wealth for the country.

Warehouse management methods should carry out technical storage work according to the different properties of materials to prevent material deterioration and damage.

Except for large quantities of wood, general materials cannot be placed in open-air warehouses; wood placed in the open air should also be regularly inspected by special personnel, and must be turned and dried after rain.

Warehouses should have strict management systems, and technical storage rules should be made for each material to prevent deterioration. At the same time, there must be record cards recording the material name, specifications, properties, uses, as well as the entry time, quantity, issue time, receiving unit, name and quantity. After monthly inventory, indicate the monthly inventory on the card. Other necessary systems include stipulating that material receiving personnel are not allowed to enter the warehouse, and strictly prohibiting smoking.

Another task of warehouse work is to face the construction site, constantly understand the material needs of the construction site, so as to ensure the smooth construction of the project. It is necessary to grasp the storage time of each material to prevent long-term backlog and accelerate the turnover of material funds. In short, warehouse work is complex and important. Every warehouse worker must be familiar with the business, master the system, and ensure the timely supply of materials and that national wealth is not subject to accidental losses.

Doing a good job in material technical supply work is the material basis for ensuring the smooth construction of basic construction. Modernized basic construction is a new thing in front of us, some material sources are difficult, and the quantity is huge, but as long as we grasp the project progress, prepare in advance, seize the difficult and large material sources, organize special personnel, and carry out processing, ordering, or entrust production factories to boldly carry out trial production by means of contract system, difficulties can be overcome. At the same time, only in overcoming difficulties can we enrich our experience and complete the glorious material technical supply work well.

    对基本建设材料供应工作的几点体会
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设材料处处长  阮焕中
    一年来，鞍山钢铁公司在基本建设材料技术供应工作上，曾经遇到很多困难，如业务生疏，人员不足，材料来源困难等。但由于材料供应工作人员明确了为工程服务的思想，面向现场，在事先不能提出材料标准规格的情况下，争取主动，初步建立了一些管理制度，基本上保证了供应，为顺利施工创造了有利条件。
    在基本建设投资的总额中，材料的费用占着很大比重。一般住宅、仓库，建筑材料费用要占投资总额的百分之六十四，改建工厂要占百分之三十一点九，新建工厂占百分之三十五。因此，如果在材料供应管理上没有企业化的管理制度，材料供应管理人员没有明确的经济核算思想，便会造成严重的浪费。更重要的是：如果计划不正确，供应不及时，便会造成停工待料，影响工程进度；在采购、订货、保管上不注意技术规格和质量，便要影响工程质量。总之，原材料技术供应工作关系着工程的好、快、省，直接影响到国家基本建设的速度。因此在基本建设中做好材料供应和管理工作，是个很重要的问题。
        一、材料管理的组织分工
    在大规模的基本建设中，要完成数量巨大，品种复杂的材料供应工作，首先必须有一套完整的组织机构，明确各部门的业务范围，互相紧密地配合。鞍钢基本建设材料处开始成立时，只有计划、材料、购运三个科。并且这三个科在业务上互不联系，领导干部对材料供应是心中无数的。去年八月，鞍钢基本建设各单位全面开展了建立责任制运动。根据群众意见和公司领导上的指示，基本建设材料科处首先改变了原有的组织机构：加强了计划科，撤销购运、材料两个科，成立金属（包括钢材、有色金属、五金配件）、机电（包括电气、工具、仪器）、化工（包括橡胶、油脂、什品、药品）三个专业科。随即明确各科的业务范围；规定计划科负责编制年、季、月的材料供应计划，掌握物资的分配，掌握每月库存统计，并派代表到各大工区去了解工程实际需要与消耗，每月作出采购计划交各专业科。专业科根据计划采购、运输、批发，每月盘点库存，并把结果告诉计划科。这样就做到了专业分工而又互相联系，初步克服了过去领导心中无数的现象。
        二、材料管理上的几个基本制度
    1、正确掌握计划，做到有计划地供应。一年来，鞍钢由国家平衡的物资占百分之五十二，国内外加工订货，占整个材料百分之五十，对这些材料，如果没有正确计划，不但会影响国家的经济建设计划，而且会使工程停工待料。一年来，我们材料供应的计划性很差，施工单位经常是一手提计划，一手要材料，一天之内追加变动最多达十七次。在国家平衡期间，提不出正确数字，过了平衡期要追加；或者在平衡时提出数字过大，运回来用不了，直接影响国家资金的周转。为了改变这种不合理现象，必须强调材料供应的计划性，克服盲目性。我们决定从一九五三年一月起，工程公司必须按月提出计划，按季订立材料供应合同。同时工程公司也要与工程队订立合同。
    2、严格实行盘点退料制度，使国家投资有效地使用，在工程上，避免浪费，加快流动资金周转。鞍钢过去在这方面做得很差，有些单位对材料库存心中无数；有的把材料领去积压在仓库里不用；有的单位却找不到材料来源；在去年十月份召开的各工程公司积压材料交流会上，即互相调剂了二十亿元的材料。没有退料制度，不但会积压资金，更严重的是会产生账外材料。据初步统计，去年账外材料达一百三十二亿元，因之成本也不正确。经验告诉我们：盘点、退料是材料部门经常的重要工作之一，必须从上到下彻底执行。原则上班组不能有库存，即使工地分散，也必须实行三天一退料的制度：工区和工段也不能有库存，较大或较远的工段，流动性很大的工程队，可以有一定的储备量，但每半月也必须作一次盘点与退料。工程竣工后，则应退还全部材料（包括已使用过的工具与折旧的材料）；仍继续使用的，不退实物，也要办账面退料转账手续。工地每月要向工程公司提出正确盘点表报，工程公司每月五日前则向基本建设材料处提出盘点表报，材料处则每季度向工业部提出正确盘点表报。在盘点库存表上，同时注明积压与呆滞，以便国家统一地调剂。
    3、原材料的一次验收制与直送工地制：基本建设材料的种类多至一万五千种，每种数量又多至数万吨或数万件，没有科学的验收制度，不但影响工程质量，而且会造成浪费，耽误供应时间，过去往往一种材料从购入到使用验收达三次以上，但到了工地，仍不合工程要求，原因是手续越多越没有专人负责。鞍钢基本建设材料处自去年九月逐步采用一次验收制，即采购人员看好货后，由仓库派专人去现地验收。这样不但节省时间，加速供应，而且责任明确。关于大宗专用材料，如砖瓦、水泥、标准规格的木材等，尽可能采取直送工地的办法，避免重复运输和多次装卸而浪费人力、耗损材料。为此，每个工地在施工前必须确定材料工区，准备好仓库、装卸工具及设备；材料供应部门必须在发货时通知工地仓库，入库后即交料付款。这是保证及时供应，避免损失的一个重要方法。
        4、加强原材料消耗定额管理，是正确计算工程成本和降低工程成本的必要措施，是贯彻经济核算制度的具体方法。技术供应部门应按国家规定的定额标准作出正确的供应计划；工区设立材料消耗记录员，记载每天的工程进度和消耗的材料；每月根据定额来对照实际消耗进行分析，找出超过定额与降低定额的原因，发现先进方法，予以表扬、奖励，在群众中推广；对超过定额的应及时进行经济核算制的教育。
    辅助材料如交手杆的木跳板，工地临时拉用的电线，混凝土所用的盒子板等，不是一次工程所消耗的材料。这种材料，发放时要按照定额，没有定额时，也须根据实际需要作出计划，使用时必须按照上级机关规定的周转方案折旧。
    基本建设工程所需用的工具多至上千种，其费用占材料费的百分之五，工具保管使用得是否合理，对降低工程成本、保证工程速度具有重大关系。特别是机械安装，主要依靠工具来完成。材料供应部门和施工现场都应有工具库的组织，专门负责制订工具使用计划，请领分配及保管等工作。施工现场工程队应设立工具房；每种工具应有特殊的保管方法，分别要按照不同的工种订出工具使用消耗定额。工具的供应应根据班组来发放，在班组设立工具使用卡片，记载领用年、月、保管人姓名、使用时期、保管与使用方法；材料供应领导机关应经常进行检查。工具亦必须根据使用定额折旧来分期算入工程成本。
    为了经常降低材料消耗定额，必须经常向群众进行经济核算思想的教育，经常征求群众意见，改进定额条件，确定新的先进定额。
        三、仓库工作
    仓库的组织应根据材料的数量与性质确定。为了便于掌握供应和便于管理，我们在总仓库的领导下，成立了十三个管理各类材料的分库；另外，还设立了废品更生库。废品更生库设立小型车床、虎钳等机械设备，负责回收工地废材，经过加工复活利用。去年鞍钢回收的上述废材，初步计算即达六十亿元。如果各级材料供应机关都能重视这一工作，将为国家节省大量财富。
    仓库管理方法，应按材料的不同性能进行技术保管工作，以防止材料变质与破损。
    除大批木材外，一般材料都不能放在露天仓库；放在露天的木材，也应有专人经常检查，雨后必须翻晒。
    仓库应有严密的管理制度，每种材料都应作出技术保管规则，以防变质。同时必须有纪录卡片，记载材料品名、规格、性质、用途，以及入库时间、数量、发出时间、领取单位、名称与数量等。每月盘点后，在卡片上注明该月库存。再如规定领料人员不得入库，以及严禁吸烟等，都是不可缺少的制度。
    仓库工作另一个任务是：必须面向工地，经常了解工地需用材料情况，以保证工程顺利施工。要掌握每种材料存放时间，防止长时间积压，以加速材料资金周转。总之，仓库工作是复杂而重要的，每个仓库工作者，必须熟悉业务，掌握制度，保证材料的及时供应和国家财富不受意外损失。
    做好材料技术供应工作，是保证基本建设顺利施工的物质基础。现代化的基本建设是摆在我们面前的新事物，某些材料来源是困难的，数量是巨大的，但是，只要我们掌握工程进度，事先做好准备，抓住困难的和大宗的材料来源，组织专人，以包干制的办法进行加工、订货，或委托生产工厂大胆进行试制，困难是可以克服的。同时，也只有在克服困难中，丰富我们的经验，才能很好地完成光荣的材料技术供应工作。
