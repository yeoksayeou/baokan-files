    Oppose Bacteriological Warfare and Contribute My Skills to the Volunteer Army
    Zhang Huaxin, Captain of the 15th Team, International Medical and Prevention Service Team of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, Tianjin Special-Class Model Worker
    When the confessions of captured American air force officers, such as Hubel and Bray, regarding the large-scale and planned bacteriological warfare conducted by the American aggressors were published in the newspapers, medical workers in Tianjin were enthusiastically signing up to join the volunteer medical teams to Korea. In three days, 4,100 medical workers from the city registered, and many repeatedly asked their leaders to approve their trip to Korea. We, the medical workers of Tianjin, solemnly warn American imperialism with utmost anger: we have the confidence, determination, and strength to crush any of your aggressive conspiracies, to crush your heinous bacteriological warfare, and to resolutely fight until you are willing to stop. We, the medical workers of Tianjin, will use practical actions to intensify the work of resisting America and aiding Korea to tell the people of the whole country and all peace-loving people in the world that we will contribute our skills, our strength, and even our lives to the cause of "healing the wounded and rescuing the dying, practicing revolutionary humanitarianism," to the cause of defending peace and opposing wars of aggression, and to the cause of crushing bacteriological warfare and safeguarding the justice and security of all mankind.
    The lifelong goal of us medical workers is to discover bacteria, eliminate bacteria, prevent diseases, and treat diseases in order to protect human health and promote human happiness. However, the war-mongers of America steal the achievements of science and use science to create plagues and kill human beings. The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff planned and instructed the U.S. troops invading Korea to conduct bacteriological warfare long ago. They carried out various evil experiments of spreading bacteria in Korea and our country. From May 1952, they expanded the scope of bacteriological warfare. They cultivated and manufactured in large quantities various pathogens that mankind has been trying to eliminate for centuries, such as plague bacilli, anthrax bacteria, cholera bacteria, and dysentery bacteria, and spread them over the heads of peaceful people using various containers and throwing methods, attempting to create plagues to achieve their bloody aggressive goals. This small group of war-mongers are the pests of mankind, the toxic bacteria among mankind. We must resolutely and ruthlessly strike at them and eliminate them, just as we eliminate toxic bacteria.
    Over the past year, the people of China and Korea and peace-loving people all over the world have achieved great victories in the struggle against bacteriological warfare, preventing the conspiracy of the American aggressors from succeeding. I am a medical worker (I was originally an attending surgeon in the surgery department of the Third Hospital of Tianjin). I am very honored to have been approved to go to the forefront of resisting America and aiding Korea this time, and to have joined the International Medical and Prevention Service Team of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, directly serving the wounded and sick of the Volunteer Army. I am determined to devote my energy, skills, and life entirely to the wounded and sick of the Volunteer Army. At the same time, I believe that the medical workers of Tianjin and the medical workers of the whole country will, together with the people of the whole country, strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea and strengthen the patriotic health campaign at home. With our joint efforts in the front and the rear, the bacteriological warfare and all aggressive conspiracies of the American aggressors are bound to fail completely.

    反对细菌战，把我的技术贡献给志愿军
    中国人民抗美援朝总会卫生工作委员会国际医防服务队
    第十五队队长、天津市特等劳动模范

    当被俘美国空军军官许威布尔、布莱等人供认美国侵略者大规模地有计划地进行细菌战的供词在报纸上公布的时候，我们天津市的医务工作者正在热烈地报名参加赴朝志愿医疗队。三天中间，全市医务工作者报名的有四千一百人，许多人三番五次地要求领导同志批准他们赴朝。我们天津全市医务工作者以万分愤怒的心情正告美帝国主义：我们有信心、有决心、有力量粉碎你们任何侵略阴谋，粉碎你们万恶的细菌战，坚决打到你们愿意罢手的时候为止。我们天津全市的医务工作者以加紧抗美援朝工作的实际行动来告诉全国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民，我们将把我们的技术、我们的力量以至我们的生命，贡献于“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”的事业，致力于保卫和平、反对侵略战争的事业，致力于粉碎细菌战争、保卫全人类的正义和安全的事业。
    我们医务工作者毕生努力的目标，是发现细菌、消灭细菌、预防疾病、治疗疾病，以保障人类的健康，促进人类的幸福。但是美国的战争贩子们却窃取科学的成果，利用科学来制造瘟疫，杀害人类。美国的参谋长联席会议很早以来就计划和指示侵朝美军进行细菌战。他们在朝鲜和我国进行了各种撒布细菌的罪恶试验。从一九五二年五月起又扩大了进行细菌战的范围。他们把人类千百年来想要消灭掉的各种病菌，如鼠疫杆菌、炭疽菌、霍乱菌、赤痢菌等大量培养制造，用各种容器、各种投掷方法撒布到和平人民头上，企图制造瘟疫，以达到他们的血腥侵略的目的。这一小撮战争贩子是人类的蟊贼，是人类中间的毒菌，我们一定要像消灭毒菌那样坚决无情地打击他们，消灭他们。
    一年以来，中朝两国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民在反细菌战斗争中已获得了伟大的胜利，使美国侵略者的阴谋未能得逞。我是一个医务工作者（我原在天津市第三医院外科任主治大夫），这次我很荣幸地被批准了走上抗美援朝的最前线，参加了中国人民抗美援朝总会卫生工作委员会国际医防服务队，直接为志愿军伤病员服务。我决心把我的精力、技术和生命，完全贡献给志愿军伤病员。同时，我相信天津全市的医务工作者和全国的医务工作者，将和全国人民一道，在国内加强抗美援朝工作，加强爱国卫生运动。在我们前方后方一齐努力下，美国侵略者的细菌战争和一切侵略阴谋，是一定要彻底失败的。
