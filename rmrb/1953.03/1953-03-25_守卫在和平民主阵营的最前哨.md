Guarding the Forefront of the Peace and Democracy Camp
Yang Duan

At dusk, I passed through the enemy's layers of fire blockade and went to the front-line positions. The enemy's searchlights shone on our positions. Our positions were brightly lit, looking almost like sand dunes in the desert when viewed in the searchlight beams.

Our positions not only looked like sand dunes from afar, but also up close. The enemy's artillery fire had turned the entire mountain into sand and gravel, and it was still firing non-stop. However, amidst this sand and gravel, there were still our indestructible field fortifications, and our sentries were calmly lying beside the fortifications, monitoring the enemy. Next to the sentries were open boxes of grenades. I walked up to the sentries and said with great admiration, "You are guarding the forefront of the peace and democracy camp!" They replied with smiles, so modest yet proud.

The squad leader on duty led me to see the positions. As he walked, he pointed out the enemy's positions to me and recounted the events of the night of January 12th:

	"...The enemy had already crept up here, but we drove them back, leaving two corpses lying here...Look, over there are the weapons we captured." I looked in the direction he was pointing, and saw a large pile of scrap metal, some of which was just a section of a gun, and some of which was half a gun.

The squad leader smiled and said, "The enemy even wanted to use bulletproof vests, but even iron ones wouldn't work!"

Suddenly, "Thump! Thump!" Two flares went off in the sky. The squad leader smiled again and said, "These timid fellows, four searchlights aren't enough, they still have to fire flares!"

We entered the "underground Great Wall."

Inside the tunnel were stacked boxes of grenades, bullets, and artillery shells. In the dim light, three comrades were gathered together, one of whom was reading aloud.

	"You're working hard!" I said.

	"It's nothing, not hard at all." The comrade who was reading raised his head and said, "Comrade Officer, we are reading 'The Undaunted,' and everyone especially loves to hear hero stories."

	"Can you see clearly?"

	"We can see clearly!" That comrade quickly replied, "Here, it's daytime twenty-four hours a day—the glory of Chairman Mao, Marshal Stalin, and General Kim Il-sung shines on us, brighter than the sun!"

They continued reading, then immediately picked up their tools and went inside to dig more tunnels. The squad leader said to me, "We plan to connect this tunnel with the one over there, so that it will be more convenient to launch attacks. Eisenhower is clamoring to launch some 'new offensive,' we'll give him a head-on blow."

We walked inside and saw several comrades digging tunnels. The comrade who had been reading earlier asked me, "Comrade Officer, is there anything you came here for today?"

	"I was ordered to visit you and learn about your situation here," I replied.

"Please tell the leaders that we all recognize the importance of our task. If Eisenhower dares to launch any 'new offensive,' we will definitely be able to smash it. This is the forefront of the peace and democracy camp, and people all over the world are watching us. We are determined to hold our positions."

	"Comrade Officer, let me show you something!" Another comrade took a tattered notebook out of his pocket and gave it to me. I opened the cover and saw the name, and knew it belonged to the deputy squad leader who had already sacrificed himself. The first three pages were pasted with photos of Chairman Mao, Marshal Stalin, and General Kim Il-sung. The Chairman Mao portrait was a gift from the People's Comfort Mission, and the other two were cut out from newspapers. The fourth and fifth pages contained copies of "Ode to Stalin" and "Song of General Kim Il-sung." Following that were Korean words written in Chinese characters, and the achievements of the comrades in the squad. The last page had different handwriting, and it said, "Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" I returned the notebook to that comrade, and the image of a young comrade-in-arms immediately appeared in my mind.

	"I expressed my attitude at the memorial service, to resolutely take revenge!" That comrade said.

	"I think, as soon as the enemy comes up, we'll sweep them with submachine guns!" A new comrade said.

	"No," that comrade said, "First use grenades, and when they run away, then use submachine guns!" He paused, then said, "Still, we should use our old method: when the enemy comes up..."

	"I think we should still try to capture them alive."

Everyone started discussing:

	"What if the son-of-a-bitch won't go even if they die?"

	"Drag them, two strong guys drag them!"

	"We have to say an American word!"

Then they reviewed the "English call-out."

They talked and laughed endlessly. As I listened, I saw many books and newspapers placed where they slept. The People's Daily, the newspapers in the Volunteer Army units, and Soviet Pictorial. The squad leader's pillow (backpack) also had a copy of "Teaching Material of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China" next to it.

	"Have some boiled water before you continue!" At this time, a comrade walked over with two tea mugs of boiled water. The comrades digging the tunnel put down their tools, wiped the sweat from their foreheads, and drank the water heartily.

The tunnel became quiet, and the sound of the enemy's broadcasting could be heard.

	"Bullshit!" A comrade immediately replied contemptuously.

	"It's calling again." Another comrade said, "After being beaten so badly by us that night, they didn't call for several days. Now they're calling again, and one day we'll capture even their loudspeaker!"

	"Of course! Not to mention their loudspeaker, we'll even crush their 'offensive'!" The comrade who had shown me the notebook earlier said with wide eyes. I saw the light of bravery shining in his bright eyes.

    守卫在和平民主阵营的最前哨
    杨端
    黄昏，我通过敌人一道又一道的火力封锁，到前沿阵地上去。敌人的探照灯光射到了我们的阵地上。我们的阵地上光亮亮的，从探照灯光中看去，它和沙漠中的沙山差不多。
    我们的阵地不但远看像沙山，近看也是沙山。敌人的炮火把这里打得满山都是沙石了，现在还在不停地打。可是，就在这沙石中间，依然有着我们的打不烂的野战工事，我们的哨兵镇静地伏在工事旁边，监视着敌人。哨兵身边摆着整箱的揭开盖子的手榴弹。我走到哨兵身边，十分敬佩地向他们说：“你们守卫在和平民主阵营的最前哨呵！”他们用微笑来回答我，是那样的谦虚而又骄傲。
    带哨的班长领着我看看阵地。他一边走一边指点敌人的阵地给我看，又给我讲述了一月十二日晚上战斗的情形：
        “……敌人已经摸到了这里，可是叫我们打回去了，留下两个死尸躺在这里……你看，那边是我们缴获的武器。”我向他指的方向看去，只见一大堆破铜烂铁，有的是一根枪的一截，有的是一根枪的半边。
    班长笑着说：“敌人还想用什么避弹衣呢，铁打的都不行！”
    忽然，“通！通！”两声，天空里挂起两颗照明弹。班长又笑了一声说：“这些胆小的家伙，四盏探照灯还不够，还要打照明弹呢！”
    我们走进了“地下长城”。
    坑道里叠着一箱箱的手榴弹、子弹和炮弹。在暗淡的灯光下，三个同志聚在一起，其中一个在朗读着什么。
        “你们辛苦啦！”我说。
    “没什么，不辛苦。”正在朗读的那个同志抬起头来说：“干事同志，我们正在读‘无畏的人’呢，大家特别爱听英雄故事。”
        “看得清吗？”
        “看得清！”那个同志很快地回答：“我们这里每天从早到晚二十四小时都是白天——毛主席、斯大林大元帅和金日成将军的光辉照着我们，比太阳还亮！”
    他们继续读完了，马上又拿起工具到里面去打坑道去了。班长对我说：“我们准备把这条坑道和那边的一条打通，这样，出击就更便利了。艾森豪威尔叫嚣要发动什么‘新攻势’，准给它一个迎头痛击。”
    我们走到里面，看到几个同志正在打坑道。刚才那个朗读的同志问我：“干事同志，你今天来到这里有什么事吗？”
    “奉命慰劳你们，并了解一下你们在这里的情况。”我回答说。
    “请你告诉首长吧，我们都认识任务的重要，如果艾森豪威尔敢发动什么‘新攻势’，我们一定能粉碎它。这里是和平民主阵营的最前哨，全世界人民都望着我们。我们坚决守住阵地。”
    “干事同志，给你一样东西看！”另一个同志从衣袋里掏出一个破旧的笔记本子给我。我翻开封面一看名字，知道是已牺牲了的副班长的。前三页贴着毛主席、斯大林大元帅和金日成将军的照片。毛主席肖像是祖国人民慰劳团赠的，其余两张是从报纸上剪下来的。第四页和第五页抄着“斯大林颂”和“金日成将军之歌”。接下去是用中国文字记的朝鲜话，并且写着班里同志们的功绩。最后一页的笔迹不同了，写着“血债要用血来还！”我把本子还给那位同志，脑子里立刻出现了一位年轻的战友的形象。
    “我在追悼会上表示了态度，要坚决报仇！”那位同志说。
    “我看，敌人一上来，我们就用冲锋枪扫！”一位新同志说。
        “不对，”那个同志说：“先用手榴弹打，等他们向后逃时，再用冲锋枪打！”停了一下，他又说：“还是按照我们的老办法打：敌人上来……”
        “我看，还是要抓活的。”
    大家讨论开了：
        “狗东西死也不走怎么办呢？”
        “拖呀，用两个力气大的拖呀！”
        “得讲句美国话才行啊！”
    接着他们又复习“英语喊话”了。
    他们谈着笑着没个完。我一面听着，一面看他们睡觉的地方放着许多的书报。人民日报，志愿军部队里的报纸，还有苏联画报。班长的枕头（背包）旁边还放着一本“中国共产党党章教材”。
    “喝了开水再干吧！”这时，一个同志端着两茶缸开水走过来。打坑道的同志把工具放下来，揩掉额上的汗，痛快地喝水。
    坑道里寂静下来了，可以听到敌人的广播器放送的声音。
    “放你的狗屁！”一个同志立刻轻蔑地回答了它。
    “又叫了。”另一个同志说：“那个晚上被我们打得连滚带爬逃回去以后，好几天都没叫了。现在又叫起来了，总有一天连它这喇叭筒也给缴过来！”“那当然罗！莫说它这个喇叭筒，连它的什么‘攻势’也要给它打垮！”刚才那个给我本子看的同志睁大眼睛这样说。我看到他的发亮的眼睛里闪耀着勇敢的光芒。（附图片）
