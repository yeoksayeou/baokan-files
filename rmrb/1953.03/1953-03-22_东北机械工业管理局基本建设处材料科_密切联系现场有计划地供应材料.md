    Northeast Machinery Industry Administration Bureau Construction Department Materials Section
    Closely Coordinate with the Site, Supply Materials in a Planned Manner
    The Materials Section of the Construction Department of the Northeast Machinery Industry Administration Bureau implemented a phased supply method when undertaking the supply work for a certain emergency project, and the results were very good.
    The material supply work of the Construction Department of the Bureau has always been a weak link, generally adopting the attitude of "being prepared for any eventuality" and "rather too much than too little." Therefore, not only was a large amount of capital tied up, but also a large number of materials were piled up at the site, which also caused difficulties for construction. This time, the Materials Section accepted the supply task for an emergency project, and the required materials were quite large in quantity, but it only had sixteen people. The project investment had not yet been issued. They were borrowing money while starting construction, and cash was particularly scarce, and even hiring transportation had to be considered. In a word, both manpower and financial resources were far from sufficient. If the old methods were used again, the task would certainly not be completed. Therefore, they adopted the method of phased supply of materials to overcome the past shortcomings and successfully completed the task in one and a half months.
    Phased supply of materials means concentrating manpower, financial resources, and transportation on the most urgently needed areas, and proceeding step by step according to plan. For the material requirements put forward by the site, the Materials Section first conducts a careful review, and then, according to the needs and progress of the project, distinguishes the priorities and urgency, and formulates a plan for supplying in batches and phases. For example, the materials for temporary construction, the materials for foundation engineering, the materials for a part of the brick wall engineering, and the tools for each type of work, these materials required at the start of construction must be stored first and supplied in the first phase. Other materials such as roof frame materials and roof covering materials are supplied in phases in order. For the same material (such as red bricks, scaffolding planks, scaffolding poles, cement tiles), it is divided into several batches according to the progress of the project and combined with the actual daily usage. After the overall phased batch plan is formulated, the staff of the Materials Section will then formulate daily execution plans separately. At the same time, they go deep into the site and closely contact the construction workers and the leaders of each team and group to understand which materials are urgently needed and which materials can be delayed slightly, so as to revise their supply plan in time. In order to cope with the temporary emergency needs that occur on site, the Materials Section also retained part of its mobile manpower.
    According to their experience, the following points must be paid attention to when implementing the phased batch supply method: First, when signing material ordering contracts, the delivery dates for batch delivery should be signed, and it should be stipulated that goods should be picked up in batches and payments made in batches. Second, the specifications and quantities of materials submitted by the site must be reviewed, and contact must be made with the site. After confirming that there are indeed no errors, orders should be placed. Third, the source of materials and market conditions should be investigated, and attention should be paid to preparing difficult-to-purchase materials in advance. Fourth, be bold and meticulous. When materials are found to be overstocked or in short supply, they must be quickly adjusted and supplemented, and there must be no waiting or hesitation.

    东北机械工业管理局基本建设处材料科
    密切联系现场有计划地供应材料
    东北机械工业管理局基本建设处材料科在担任某项紧急工程的供应工作时，实行了分段供应的方法，效果很好。
    该局基本建设处的材料供应工作向来是个薄弱环节，一般地是采取“有备无患”、“宁多勿缺”的态度。因此，不但积压了大量资金，而且大批材料堆积在现场，也给施工造成困难。这次，材料科接受了一项紧急工程的供应任务，所需材料数量相当庞大，而本身只有十六个人，工程的投资还没发下来，正一面借款一面动工，现金特别缺乏，连雇用运输力也得考虑。一句话，人力财力都远远不敷需要。如再用过去老一套的方法，一定完不成任务。因此，他们采取了材料分段供应法，克服了过去的缺点，在一个半月内胜利完成了任务。
    分段供应材料就是把人力、财力、运输力集中地用到最迫切需要的地方，按计划有步骤地办事。材料科对于现场所提出的对于材料的要求，首先作一次慎重的审核，然后根据工程需要和进度，分别轻重缓急，订出分批分期供应的计划。例如暂设工程的用料、地基工程的用料、一部分砖墙工程的用料、各工种的工具，这些开工即需的材料要最先储备起来，在第一期供应。其他如房架材料、房盖材料则依序分期供应。对于同一材料（如红砖、跳板、脚手杆、洋灰瓦）是按工程进度，结合每日实际用量，分成几批来供应。总的分期分批计划订出之后，材料科工作人员再分别制订逐日执行计划，同时深入现场和施工员、各班、组长密切联系，随时了解哪些材料急需，哪些材料可以稍缓，以便及时修正自己的供应计划。为了应付现场临时发生的紧急需要，材料科还留下了部分机动人力。
    根据他们的经验，实行分期分批供应法必须注意下列几点：第一、在签订材料订货合同时，要签订分批交货日期，规定要分批提货、分批交款。第二、对于现场所提的材料规格和数量，要进行审核，并与现场联系，认为确实没有错误后，再去订货。第三、要调查材料来源与市场情况，难购的材料应该注意提前准备。第四、要胆大心细，发现材料积压或缺乏时，必须迅速调剂追补，不能等待迟疑。
