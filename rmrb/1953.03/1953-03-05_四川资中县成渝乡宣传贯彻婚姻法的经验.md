Sichuan Neijiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law, in December 1952, extracted a batch of cadres from the prefectural, county, and district levels, and together with the working group of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law, went to Chengyu Township, Zizhong County, to conduct typical experimental work in publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law. The movement started on December 10, 1952, and ended on January 1, 1953. Because the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions on implementing the Marriage Law was implemented in the movement, and the educational approach was adhered to, the development of the entire movement was normal and healthy, and some experience was gained.

Chengyu Township, Fifth District, Zizhong County, completed land reform in 1951 and re-examination in the spring of 1952; after a series of movements, the masses already had a certain level of awareness. During the land reform re-examination, the Marriage Law was also publicized. In the "March 8th" celebration of 1952, a public trial was held in the district, and working cadres who interfered with freedom of marriage and forced women to commit suicide were sentenced to imprisonment. The general public knew that "men must be twenty and women eighteen to marry" and "parents must not arrange marriages." However, because the publicity was not comprehensive and in-depth, cadres and the masses still had many misunderstandings about the Marriage Law, and cadres generally feared handling marriage issues. The phenomenon of beating and abusing women was still very serious, and feudal families who oppressed and abused women also accounted for a considerable proportion. Of the 205 disputes in the township, 115 involved husbands abusing and beating their wives, 34 involved mothers-in-law abusing and beating their daughters-in-law, 11 involved raising child brides, and 5 involved abusing children. In 1952, a child bride committed suicide by drowning in a pond due to abuse; a 50-year-old Zhu Cuiping was injured by her husband; and three women attempted suicide due to cruel abuse.

I. Progress of the Movement

The Chengyu Township Marriage Law implementation movement was divided into three stages.

The first stage was to organize cadres to study, understand the situation, publicize policies, and stabilize emotions. The time allotted was seven days.

Before the arrival of the work group, the masses in Chengyu Township heard that the township was to be the focus of the Marriage Law implementation, and various concerns arose. Some thought, "Now divorces will probably be completed"; three mothers-in-law in Heping Village who abused their daughters-in-law were frightened and cried. Generally, people did not know what the Marriage Law implementation movement would entail.

In response to the above situation, the work group first convened meetings of township cadres and Party and Youth League members, held township cadre training classes, cleared up cadres' thinking, and cultivated movement backbone. At the same time, some staff members went to various villages to understand the situation, organize propaganda groups, and cooperate with showing slides and exhibiting pictures to publicize policies and repeatedly explain that the purpose of the movement was to promote family harmony and unity in production in order to dispel the concerns of the masses.

A total of 161 cadres above the level of Farmers' Association group leader and Women's Association group leader, as well as Party and Youth League members, participated in the study. First, combined with production, the obstacles to women's participation in production were discussed, then the harms of the feudal marriage system and the benefits of the new democratic marriage system were reported and discussed in groups, and then, through general assembly reports and typical speeches, the crimes of the feudal marriage system were exposed. Finally, the learning plans of leaders in various villages were discussed jointly.

The second stage was to widely and deeply publicize the Marriage Law among the masses, organize the masses to study and discuss, and mediate general family disputes. The time allotted was eight days.

First, village representative conferences were convened in various villages to comprehensively publicize the Marriage Law and explain policies, and then discussions were held in residential groups. However, because families were together when these meetings first started, opposition was initially formed, leading to a stalemate. Later, separate meetings were held for young people, men, women, and old women to mobilize them separately. Education was conducted in response to different ideological situations, which opened up the situation, and the emotions of the masses gradually rose. General family disputes were resolved during the learning process, forming a climax of "resolving knots."

At the same time, propagandists were trained using the propagandists as the backbone to organize propaganda forces, cooperate with mass learning, carry out propaganda and education work, and help the masses change their understanding and improve their thinking (Editor's note: The work of training propagandists should generally be done in the first stage).

The third stage was to first hold public trials to deal with criminals who aroused great public indignation, then commend models, establish family covenants and production plans, and establish mediation organizations, develop the Youth League, improve women's representative meetings and propaganda organizations, lead the masses to discuss mutual aid groups and production issues, and lay the foundation for the regular implementation of the Marriage Law in the future; finally, summarize the gains of the movement and hold celebrations for models and free marriage ceremonies. The total time was eight days.

II. Gains

(1) The publicity of the Marriage Law basically achieved household knowledge. The number of people who regularly participated in the study accounted for about 70 percent of the number who should have participated, and in individual villages, it reached over 90 percent. Therefore, the general public recognized the crimes of the feudal marriage system, were happy to accept the new marriage system, and enthusiastically supported the Marriage Law. The thoughts and behaviors of abusing and beating women were universally criticized, and "second-marriage sisters-in-law" (remarried women) were no longer discriminated against. The masses reflected: Chairman Mao's Marriage Law is really good, twenty-seven articles, every article is for the people. In the past, we only knew that marriage required men to be twenty and women eighteen, but now we know that the Marriage Law also manages our family unity and production improvement.

(2) Family disputes were universally resolved and marriage problems were handled, changing old families and achieving the effect of transforming customs. A total of 205 disputes in the township were resolved on a conscious basis after learning, 199 cases; including 185 cases of improved family relations, 2 cases of child brides returning home, 6 cases of early marriages voluntarily separating, 2 cases of divorce, and 4 other cases. Only individual serious criminals who abused child brides, abused children to death, raped young girls, or raped daughters-in-law were criminally punished. Many long-term unresolved problems were solved in the movement. For example, the Zhou Jinting couple, who had been separated for three years (putting his wife to sleep in the pigsty) and had been mediated unsuccessfully more than ten times, have now reconciled, and Zhou Jinting immediately took out cloth to sew clothes for his wife. During the New Year's Day opera, many men carried their babies and came with their wives, and many couples sat side by side, which had never happened before.

(3) The political awareness and production enthusiasm of the masses have been improved. After this movement, the masses were even more grateful to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Peng Desong, an old man in his seventies, said: "Chairman Mao sits in Beijing and is so thoughtful, not only implementing land reform, but also thinking about our family affairs." Some masses said: "People say that Chairman Mao is better than parents, but I say that Chairman Mao is even closer than parents." Through commending models, making covenants, etc., the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in social activities and production has been universally improved. Not only can families unite to produce, but the township has also organized a production inspection team to inspect various villages to promote the wheat bumper harvest competition, so that all the wheat in the township has been weeded twice before January 5.

(4) Backbone for implementing the Marriage Law was cultivated, and various relevant organizations were established and improved. During the movement, 81 activists were cultivated, 9 Party propagandists and 21 Youth League members were developed, and many new types of democratic and harmonious families and happy married lives emerged, laying a solid foundation for the future implementation of the Marriage Law.

III. Lessons Learned

(1) To fully mobilize the masses, the masses must understand that the Marriage Law implementation movement is aimed at opposing the feudal marriage system and achieving family democracy and harmony, and unity in production; and adhere to the educational approach. Whether in reports or group discussions, this spirit must be implemented to eliminate the concerns of the masses, and through specific examples, specific analysis must be made to repeatedly explain the pain caused by the feudal marriage system to all kinds of people (men, women, old, young) and the impact on production, to arouse the masses' hatred for the feudal marriage system and to ideologically draw a clear line between the old and new marriage systems. As long as the masses truly recognize the harms of the feudal marriage system and realize the benefits of the new democratic marriage system, they will consciously throw themselves into the movement. However, because the general public (including women who suffer the most) are deeply poisoned by feudal ideology, there will inevitably be various concerns and even resistance in their thinking, and they cannot quickly become aware of it. Therefore, it is necessary to patiently and repeatedly conduct education and enlightenment in order to gradually change and improve their understanding. Any impatient and rude attitude will not only fail to mobilize the masses, but will hinder the movement; the practice of being restrained and not daring to explain policies to the masses and criticize feudal ideas will only increase the concerns of the masses, and these should be prevented and avoided. Secondly, separate meetings should be held for men, women, old women, and young people to conduct education in response to various different ideological concerns, and to use the method of cultivating typical examples to drive the whole, and enlighten them to recognize the crimes of the feudal marriage system from the pain they have suffered, so that the target of opposition points to the feudal marriage system. After the masses have a certain degree of awareness and understanding, group meetings should be held in groups to mediate some marriage problems by means of criticism and self-criticism; only in this way can problems be solved and the opposition and struggle between people not be formed.

Facts have proved that education can solve problems. In this movement, of the 205 disputes mediated in the township, 199 were resolved on a conscious basis during the learning and discussion process.

(2) Training the backbone and mobilizing the broad masses through the backbone is the key to doing a good job in the movement. In the first stage, the work group focused on convening meetings of Party and Youth League members, organizing cadre learning, and repeatedly explaining policies to them to clear their thinking. At the same time, many important issues during the movement were also discussed by them in advance before being implemented among the masses. In this way, the vast majority of them played a backbone role in the movement.

(3) To do a good job in propaganda work, there must be unified organization and leadership, mobilize and organize all propaganda forces, pay attention to discovering propaganda talents among the masses, and cultivate them to strengthen the propaganda forces. It is necessary to fully utilize various propaganda methods and propaganda tools, and the propaganda content should be vivid and specific, and correctly reflect the policies. It is necessary to discover typical examples and compile lyrics in a timely manner so that propaganda work can closely cooperate with the progress of the entire movement, promote each other, and play a greater role.

    四川资中县成渝乡宣传贯彻婚姻法的经验
    中共四川省内江地委会贯彻执行婚姻法委员会在一九五二年十二月从专、县、区各级抽调了一批干部，与中共四川省委贯彻执行婚姻法委员会工作组合组工作组，赴资中县成渝乡进行宣传贯彻婚姻法的典型实验工作。运动自一九五二年十二月十日起，至一九五三年一月一日结束。由于在运动中贯彻了党中央关于贯彻执行婚姻法的指示，坚持了教育方针，因此整个运动的发展是正常的，健康的，并取得了一些经验。
    资中县第五区成渝乡于一九五一年完成土地改革，一九五二年春复查；经过一系列的运动，群众已有一定的觉悟。土地改革复查时，曾结合宣传婚姻法，一九五二年“三八”节，在区上开过公审会，对干涉婚姻自由、逼迫妇女自杀的工作干部判处了徒刑。一般群众都知道“男二十、女十八才能结婚”、“父母不得包办婚姻”。但因宣传不全面、不深入，干部和群众对婚姻法仍有不少误解，一般干部都怕处理婚姻问题。打骂虐待妇女的现象仍很严重，压迫虐待妇女的封建家庭也占相当大的比例。该乡二百零五件纠纷中，有丈夫虐待打骂妻子的一百一十五件，公婆虐待打骂媳妇的三十四件，养童养媳十一件，虐待子女的五件。一九五二年还有一个童养媳因被虐待投塘自杀；一个五十多岁的朱萃萍被丈夫打伤；三个妇女因被残酷虐待，企图自杀。
    一、运动进展情况
    成渝乡贯彻婚姻法运动分为三个阶段。
    第一阶段是组织干部学习，摸清情况，宣传政策，安定情绪。时间计七天。
    工作组未来之前，成渝乡的群众听说要以本乡作为贯彻婚姻法的重点乡，曾发生各种顾虑。有的认为“这下离婚怕要离完了”；和平村有三个虐待媳妇的婆婆吓得哭了。一般人都不知道贯彻婚姻法运动要搞些什么。
    针对上述情况，工作组首先召开乡干部和党员、团员会议，举办乡干部训练班，打通干部思想，培养运动骨干。同时，一部分工作人员分别到各村了解情况，组织宣传组，配合放映幻灯、展览图片等，宣传政策，反复交代运动的目的是为了使家庭和睦、团结生产，以解除群众顾虑。
    参加学习的共有农民协会小组长、妇女小组长以上干部及党员、团员一百六十一人。首先结合生产，着重讨论了妇女参加生产的障碍问题，然后报告和小组讨论封建婚姻制度的害处和新民主主义婚姻制度的好处，进而通过大会报告和典型发言，揭露封建婚姻制度的罪恶，最后共同讨论各村领导学习的计划。
    第二阶段，是在群众中广泛深入地宣传婚姻法，组织群众学习讨论，调解一般家庭纠纷。时间计八天。
    首先召开各村村民代表大会，全面宣传婚姻法，交代政策，然后再以居民小组为单位进行讨论。但因开始开这些会时一家人都在一起，曾一度形成对立，陷于僵局。后经分别召开青年、男人、妇女、老婆婆会议，分别发动，针对不同思想情况，进行教育，才打开了局面，群众情绪逐步高涨，一般家庭纠纷都在学习过程中得到解决，形成了“解疙瘩”的高潮。
    同时，以宣传员为骨干训练宣传队伍，组织宣传力量，配合群众学习，进行宣传教育工作，帮助群众转变认识和提高思想（编者按：训练宣传员的工作一般应在第一阶段）。
    第三阶段是首先开公审会处理民愤极大的罪犯，然后表扬模范，订立家庭公约和生产计划，并建立调解组织，发展青年团，健全妇女代表会和宣传组织，领导群众讨论互助组和生产问题，为今后经常贯彻婚姻法的工作打下基础；最后总结运动收获，举行庆贺模范和自由结婚仪式。时间共八天。
    二、收　获
    （一）宣传婚姻法基本上做到了家喻户晓。经常参加学习的人数约占应参加人数的百分之七十，个别村达百分之九十以上。因此一般群众都认识到封建婚姻制度的罪恶，乐于接受新的婚姻制度，热烈拥护婚姻法。虐待打骂妇女的思想和行为普遍受到批判，“二婚嫂”（再婚妇女）也不再被歧视。群众反映：毛主席的婚姻法硬是好，二十七条，条条为人民。过去只晓得结婚要男二十、女十八，现在才晓得婚姻法还要管到我们家庭的团结和搞好生产。
    （二）普遍解除了家庭纠纷和处理了婚姻问题，改变了旧家庭，收到了移风易俗的效果。全乡共二百零五件纠纷，经过学习，在自觉的基础上解决了一百九十九件；计改善家庭关系的一百八十五件，童养媳回家二件，早婚自愿分居的六件，离婚的二件，其他四件。只有个别虐待童养媳及虐待子女致死、强奸幼女、强奸媳妇的严重罪犯，才受到刑事处分。许多长期未得到解决的问题，都在运动中解决了。如分居三年（把老婆弄到猪圈睡）、曾经进行十余次调解无效的周金廷夫妇，现已重新和好，周金廷还马上拿布出来给老婆缝衣服。元旦看戏时，许多男人背着娃儿和老婆一道来，好些夫妇都并排坐着，这些都是过去从未有过的现象。
    （三）提高了群众的政治觉悟和生产积极性。经过这次运动，群众更加感激毛主席和共产党，七十多岁的老人彭德松说：“毛主席坐在北京，真想得周到，不但实行了土地改革，还想到我们的家务事。”有的群众说：“人说毛主席比爹娘，我说毛主席比爹娘还亲。”通过表扬模范、订公约等，群众参加社会活动的热情和生产积极性都普遍提高，不单家庭能团结生产，乡上还组织了生产检查组，到各村巡回检查，推动小麦丰产竞赛运动，使全乡的小麦在一月五日前，都薅?了两次。
    （四）培养了贯彻执行婚姻法的骨干，建立与健全了各种有关组织。在运动中，培养了八十一个积极分子，发展了九个党的宣传员和二十一个青年团员，出现了不少民主和睦、团结生产的新型家庭和美满的夫妇生活，为今后贯彻执行婚姻法工作打下了巩固的基础。
    三、经验教训
    （一）要全面发动群众，必须使群众了解贯彻婚姻法运动是为了反对封建婚姻制度，达到家庭民主和睦、团结生产的目的；并坚持教育方针。无论在报告或小组讨论时，都要贯串这一精神，以消除群众的顾虑，并通过具体事例，作出具体分析，反复说明封建婚姻制度给各种人（男、女、老、少）造成的痛苦以及对生产的影响，激起群众对封建婚姻制度的仇恨和从思想上划清新旧婚姻制度的界限。只要群众真正认识了封建婚姻制度的害处，体会到新民主主义婚姻制度的好处，他们就会自觉地投入运动。但由于一般群众（包括受痛苦最深的妇女）所受封建思想的毒害极深，思想上必然存在着种种顾虑，甚至有抵触情绪，不是很快就可以觉悟过来的，因此，必须耐心地反复进行教育启发，才能使他们的认识逐渐转变和提高。任何急躁粗暴的态度，不但不能发动群众，反会使运动受到阻碍；束手束脚、不敢正面向群众交代政策、批判封建思想的作法，也只有增加群众的顾虑，这些都是应该防止和避免的。其次，要分别召开男、女、老婆婆、青年等会议，针对各种不同的思想顾虑进行教育，并以培养典型、带动全体的方法，启发他们从自身所受的痛苦认识封建婚姻制度的罪恶，使反对的目标指向封建婚姻制度。在群众有了一定的觉悟与认识后，再以小组为单位混合开会，运用批评和自我批评的方式，调解一些婚姻问题；只有这样，才能解决问题，才不致形成人与人的对立和斗争。
    事实证明：教育是可以解决问题的。在这次运动中该乡调解的二百零五件纠纷，一百九十九件都是在学习讨论过程中，在群众自觉的基础上解决的。
    （二）训练骨干，通过骨干来发动广大群众，是搞好运动的关键。第一阶段工作组即集中精力召开党员、团员会议，组织干部学习，向他们反复交代政策，打通思想。同时，运动过程中许多重要问题，也都事先通过他们的讨论，然后贯彻到群众中去。这样便使他们的绝大部分都在运动中发挥了骨干作用。
    （三）做好宣传工作，要有统一的组织领导，动员和组织一切宣传力量，注意发现群众中的宣传人材，加以培养，以壮大宣传力量。要充分运用各种各样的宣传方式和宣传工具，宣传内容要生动具体，正确地体现政策。要发现典型事例，及时编写唱词等，使宣传工作与整个运动的进展密切配合，互相推动，发挥更大的作用。
