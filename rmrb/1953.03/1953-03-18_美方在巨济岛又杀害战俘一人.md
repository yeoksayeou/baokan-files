Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 16th: According to the U.S. side's announcement, another of our captured personnel was murdered in the U.S. side's Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp on March 12th. As usual, the U.S. side lied, saying that this prisoner of war "committed suicide" by hanging himself.

    To cover up the truth of these continuously occurring so-called "suicide" incidents and shirk responsibility for murdering prisoners of war, the spokesman for the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp command shamelessly said, "The suicide rate of prisoners of war is actually lower than the normal suicide rate of a comparable population in the United States." However, this clumsy attempt to shirk responsibility for murdering prisoners of war simultaneously exposes the U.S. side's conspiracy to use the absurd excuse of "prisoner of war suicide" to murder more prisoners of war in the future.

    According to the U.S. side's spokesman, from August 1st of last year to March 12th of this year, a total of 23 so-called "suicide" incidents have occurred in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, 13 of which occurred among captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and 10 among captured personnel of the Korean People's Army. In addition, two "hanging incidents" of prisoners of war have been proven to be "murders." However, the numbers already announced by the U.S. side are much lower than this figure. According to materials already announced by the U.S. side, during the aforementioned period, the U.S. side killed a total of eight captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and twelve captured personnel of the Korean People's Army under the guise of "suicide" or "murder." From this, it can be seen that the U.S. side frequently conceals its crimes of murdering prisoners of war, and clearly there are many more incidents of massacring prisoners of war that have not been revealed.

### 美方在巨济岛又杀害战俘一人

    美方在巨济岛又杀害战俘一人
    【新华社开城十六日电】据美方宣布，三月十二日在美方巨济岛战俘营中又有我方被俘人员一名被谋害。美方照例撒谎说这名战俘是上吊“自杀”的。
    美方战俘营司令部发言人为了掩饰这种不断发生的所谓“自杀”事件的真相，推卸杀害战俘的责任，竟然无耻地说：“战俘的自杀比例数字，和美国相当人口的正常自杀数字比起来，还算是少的。”但是这种企图推卸谋杀战俘罪责的拙劣说法，同时却暴露了美方今后将更多地用这种“战俘自杀”的荒唐借口来杀害战俘的阴谋。
    据美方发言人宣称，从去年八月一日到今年三月十二日为止，在美方战俘营中一共发生过二十三次所谓“自杀”事件，其中十三次在中国人民志愿军被俘人员中发生，十次发生在朝鲜人民军被俘人员中。此外，还有两次战俘“吊死事件”已经证明是
    “被谋杀”的。但是，美方所已经宣布的数字却比这个数字少得多。根据美方已经宣布的材料，在上述时期内，美方在“自杀”或“被谋杀”借口下杀害中国人民志愿军被俘人员共八次，杀害朝鲜人民军被俘人员共十二次。由此可见，美方经常隐瞒他们杀害战俘的罪行，显然还有更多次屠杀战俘的事件没有被透露出来。
