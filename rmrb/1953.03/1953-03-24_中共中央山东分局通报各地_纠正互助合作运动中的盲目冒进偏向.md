The Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee recently issued a circular requiring Party committees at all levels in the province to strengthen leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement during the spring plowing season in order to correct the relatively common tendency of blind advance currently occurring in the mutual aid and cooperation movement throughout the province.

The circular pointed out that the situation of blind advance in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Shandong Province is as follows: In carrying out production direction education and production appraisals for farmers in many counties and districts, they one-sidedly promoted the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives and advanced mutual aid teams, exaggerated the shortcomings of general mutual aid teams, and, coupled with the impetuous sentiments of a few rural activists, the development and upgrading of mutual aid and cooperative organizations in many areas violated the objective laws of development, blindly organizing agricultural production cooperatives and expanding mutual aid teams, advocating "small groups merge into large groups," and publicizing "groups with fewer than five households don't count," and "it is glorious to join large groups"; Detached from the actual conditions of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives and the actual needs of farmers, public property was blindly expanded. Yanggu County established thirty-two agricultural production cooperatives in one winter, but many farmers did not truly agree to join the cooperatives. The Eighth District of Jiaohe County merged several mutual aid teams into twenty-six large groups, which was also not truly in line with the needs of the masses. In particular, because the mutual aid teams in the district blindly expanded public property, two hundred and five mutual aid teams universally valued livestock and farm tools and turned them over to the groups regardless of the conditions, thus adding many livestock sheds that could have been avoided and wasting a lot of farmers' funds. Secondly, there was a blind pursuit of the number of organizations formed. The Seventh District of Liaocheng County organized eighty-three mutual aid teams in eight natural villages, and the nominal "organization" reached 92 percent of the farm households, but thirty-five of them were formalistic and fake mutual aid teams, accounting for 42.2 percent of the farm households. These areas also produced the phenomenon of excluding individual farmers, isolating "single households" politically and economically.

The circular pointed out that blind advance only has bad results. In the merged large groups, many mutual aid teams collapsed due to management difficulties and farmers' unwillingness. The agricultural production cooperatives developed from blind advance were even more chaotic due to the lack of leading cadres and management experience, directly affecting the current spring plowing production, so that some newly established agricultural production cooperatives do not even have a general plan for spring plowing; some agricultural production cooperatives have put the livestock of their members into the cooperatives, but there is no way to solve the problem of fodder, so they cannot carry out spring plowing in time. Due to the evil consequences of blindly expanding public property, some group members and cooperative members had to be forced to withdraw from the groups and cooperatives, reducing the production enthusiasm of many farmers and causing individual farmers to worry about organizing.

Therefore, the Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee pointed out in the circular: At present, Party committees at all levels must seize the spring plowing season, adapt to the production needs of the masses of farmers, and organize and develop mutual aid and cooperative organizations according to different situations, and resolutely implement the policy of steady advance and active leadership. Those mutual aid teams that have been reluctantly organized but can persist should be helped to consolidate; those that cannot persist should be helped to reorganize according to the principle of voluntariness. Agricultural production cooperatives should still adhere to the principle of trial implementation, and agricultural production cooperatives that do not have the conditions should be persuaded to change to mutual aid teams and continue to create conditions for establishing cooperatives. At present, Party committees at all levels in Shandong Province and the Shandong Provincial People's Government are sending a large number of cadres to the countryside to inspect and lead spring plowing production and help correct the tendency of blind advance in the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

### 中共中央山东分局通报各地  纠正互助合作运动中的盲目冒进偏向

    中共中央山东分局通报各地
    纠正互助合作运动中的盲目冒进偏向
    中共中央山东分局最近发出通报，要求全省各级党委在春耕生产中加强对互助合作运动的领导，以便纠正目前全省互助合作运动中较普遍发生的盲目冒进的偏向。
    通报中指出山东省互助合作运动中盲目冒进的情况是：许多县、区在向农民进行生产方向教育和生产评比中，片面宣传农业生产合作社和高级互助组的好处，夸大一般互助组的缺点，加上少数农村积极分子的急躁情绪，许多地区的互助合作组织在发展和提高中违反了客观的发展规律，盲目地举办农业生产合作社和扩大互助组，提倡“小组并大组”，宣传“五户以下的不算组”，“参加大组光荣”；脱离互助组、农业生产合作社的实际条件和农民的实际需要，盲目地扩大公共财产。阳谷县一个冬天办了三十二个农业生产合作社，但是很多农民却并不是真正同意入社的。胶河县第八区合并了若干互助组成为二十六个大组，也并不是真正合乎群众要求的。特别是因为该区的互助组盲目扩大公共财产，有二百零五个互助组不管条件如何，普遍地将牲口、农具作价归组，因而增盖了许多本来可以不盖的牲口棚，浪费了农民大量的资金。其次是盲目地追求组织起来数字的多少。聊城县第七区在八个自然村中组织了八十三个互助组，名义上“组织起来”达到了农户的百分之九十二，但其中形式主义的和假的互助组即有三十五个，占了农户的百分之四十二点二。这些地区并产生了排斥个体农民的现象，从政治上和经济上去孤立“单干户”。
    通报中指出：盲目冒进只有不好的结果。在合并起来的大组中，因为管理困难，农民不自愿，许多互助组垮台了。由冒进而发展起来的农业生产合作社，更因缺乏领导骨干和管理经验，情况十分混乱，直接影响了当前的春耕生产，以致有些新成立的农业生产合作社，到现在连个春耕的大概计划还没有；有的农业生产合作社把社员的牲口入了社，但草料没有办法解决，因而不能及时进行春耕。由于盲目扩大公共财产的恶果，有些组员、社员不得不被迫退组退社，减低了许多农民生产的积极性，引起了个体农民对组织起来的顾虑。
    因此，中共中央山东分局在通报中指出：目前各级党委必须抓住春耕生产季节，适应农民群众的生产需要，分别不同情况，进行整理与发展互助合作组织，坚决贯彻稳步前进、积极领导的方针。对勉强组织起来的互助组而可以坚持下来的，应帮助其巩固；不能坚持的，应根据自愿原则帮助其改组。对农业生产合作社仍应坚持试办的方针，对不具备条件的农业生产合作社，应说服农民改为互助组，继续创造建社条件。现在中共山东省各级党委和山东省人民政府正派出大批干部下乡检查和领导春耕生产，帮助纠正互助合作运动中的盲目冒进偏向。    （新华社）
