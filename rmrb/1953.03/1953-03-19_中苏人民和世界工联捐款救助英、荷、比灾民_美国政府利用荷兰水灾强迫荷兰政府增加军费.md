Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In late January and early February, coastal areas of the Netherlands, Britain, and Belgium were hit by a North Sea storm, causing dyke breaches and severe flooding. Approximately one-sixth of the land in the Netherlands was flooded, affecting about one million people, with approximately one thousand four hundred deaths. In Britain, more than three thousand people went missing, and nearly fifty thousand were left homeless. The disaster situation in Belgium was also serious.

Soviet Ambassador Gromyko visited the British Foreign Office regarding this matter, expressing condolences to the British people for the disaster. Soviet public organizations have donated 90,000 pounds as a fund to aid British flood victims.

The Soviet Ambassador to the Netherlands, Zaitsev, expressed condolences to the Dutch Prime Minister regarding the floods in the Netherlands. Soviet mass organizations donated 1 million Dutch guilders to the Dutch National Disaster Relief Fund Committee. Dutch radio broadcast the news of the assistance provided by Soviet mass organizations, and Dutch newspapers published this news prominently.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Chinese People's Relief Association, the Red Cross Society of China, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and the All-China Youth Federation recently jointly sent telegrams to the Dutch General Confederation of Trade Unions, the British-China Friendship Association, and the World Federation of Trade Unions, expressing the Chinese people's concern and sympathy for the people of the Netherlands, Britain, and Belgium who suffered from the floods. These five organizations also raised more than 2.89 billion RMB yuan, donating it to the affected people of the Netherlands, Britain, and Belgium. Among them, more than 1.57 billion RMB yuan was donated to the flood victims in the Netherlands; more than 1.05 billion RMB yuan was donated to the flood victims in Britain; and more than 260 million RMB yuan was donated to the flood victims in Belgium.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The "Workers' Daily" reported on the 12th: After the recent floods in Britain, the World Federation of Trade Unions immediately sent a telegram to the British Trades Union Congress, stating that the World Federation of Trade Unions and its affiliated organizations were "ready to provide immediate material assistance to the homeless families of workers." The highest committee of the Trades Union Congress has acknowledged receiving this suggestion, but it has made no further response.

The "Workers' Daily" pointed out: The World Federation of Trade Unions also made the same suggestion to the Dutch trade unions, but it was immediately accepted, and a sum equivalent to 5,000 pounds has been given to the Dutch flood victims for use. Organizations affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions are conducting large-scale fundraising for the relief of Dutch disaster victims, including funds, household goods, food, clothing, and farm implements.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In February, due to a storm in the North Sea, the coastal dikes of the Netherlands breached, causing a major flood. While the victims were in urgent need of relief, the U.S. government, while feigning concern, took advantage of the flood to force the Dutch government to increase military spending according to U.S. demands. According to the Dutch Communist Party's organ, "De Waarheid" (Truth), the Netherlands had requested that the United States agree to allocate 200 million Dutch guilders from the so-called "counterpart fund" (Note: Countries receiving U.S. "aid" must allocate an amount of their own money equal to the amount of U.S. "aid" and freeze it. This money can only be used with U.S. consent) to be used for flood relief measures. The United States replied that if this was to be done, 300 million Dutch guilders must also be allocated from this fund to manufacture war materials. The Dutch "De Waarheid" pointed out: "In this way, for every Dutch guilder the Dutch government spends on building dikes, it must spend one and a half guilders to manufacture guns, cannons and jet fighters." The Dutch bourgeois newspaper "Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant" (New Rotterdam Newspaper) commented on this situation, saying: "It is now very clear: if 200 million Dutch guilders had been allocated from the budget two years ago to repair the dikes, we would not have the current disaster."

    中苏人民和世界工联捐款救助英、荷、比灾民
    美国政府利用荷兰水灾强迫荷兰政府增加军费
    据新华社讯：一月底二月初，荷兰、英国和比利时沿海地区遭受北海风暴的袭击，堤坝决口，发生了严重水灾。荷兰全国约六分之一的土地被淹，受灾的人们约有一百万，约有一千四百人被淹死。英国有三千多人因此失踪，将近五万人因此无家可归。比利时的灾情也很严重。
    苏联大使葛罗米柯曾为这件事访问英国外交部，对于英国人民遭受此次灾难表示慰问。苏联公众团体已经捐款九万英镑，作为救助英国水灾受害者的基金。
      苏联驻荷兰大使扎伊采夫就荷兰遭受水灾一事，慰问荷兰首相。苏联各群众团体捐赠了一百万荷盾给荷兰全国救灾基金委员会。荷兰无线电台广播了苏联群众团体给予援助的消息，荷兰各报还以显著地位发表了这方面的消息。
    据新华社讯：中国人民救济总会、中国红十字会总会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会和中华全国民主青年联合总会等五个团体最近特联名打电报给荷兰总工会、英中友好协会和世界工会联合会，表示中国人民对遭受水灾的荷兰、英国及比利时人民的关怀和同情。这五个团体还筹募了人民币二十八亿九千余万元，捐助给荷兰、英国及比利时的受灾人民。其中十五亿七千余万元捐助荷兰受灾人民；十亿五千余万元捐助英国受灾人民；二亿六千余万元捐助比利时受灾人民。
    据新华社讯：“工人日报”在十二日报道：在英国最近一次的水灾发生以后，世界工会联合会就立刻打电报给英国职工大会，表示世界工会联合会和所属的各团体“准备立即给与无家可归的工人家属以物质上的援助”。职工大会最高委员会已承认接到了这一个建议，但是它却没有进一步的表示。
    “工人日报”指出：世界工会联合会也向荷兰工会提出了同样的建议，但被立刻接受下来，于是相当于五千英镑的一笔款项已交给荷兰遭受水灾的灾民们使用了。隶属于世界工会联合会的各组织为救济荷兰灾民，正在大规模捐募基金、家庭用具、食物、衣服和农具。
    据新华社讯：二月间，因北海发生风暴，荷兰沿海堤坝决口，造成了大水灾。虽然灾民急需救济，表面装作关切灾情的美国政府却利用水灾，强迫荷兰政府按美国要求再增加军费。据荷兰共产党机关报“真理报”消息，荷兰曾要求美国同意荷兰在所谓“对等基金”（按：接受美“援”的国家都要拨出和美“援”款额相同的一笔本国钱，冻结起来，这笔钱必须得美国同意才能动用）中拨出二亿荷盾用作水灾善后措施。美国回答说：如果要这样做，就必须同时从这个基金里拨出三亿荷盾来制造战争物资。荷兰“真理报”指出：“这样，荷兰政府每用一个荷盾来建筑堤坝，就必须用一个半荷盾去制造枪炮和喷气战斗机。”荷兰资产阶级报纸“东方日报”评论这种情形说：“目前已经十分清楚：如果两年前由预算中拨二亿荷盾来修堤坝，我们就不至于有目前的灾害。”
