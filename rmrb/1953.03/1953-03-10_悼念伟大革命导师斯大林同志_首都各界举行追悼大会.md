Xinhua News Agency report: The memorial service held by people from all walks of life in the capital of the People's Republic of China to mourn the great revolutionary teacher Comrade Stalin took place on the afternoon of the 9th in Tiananmen Square. Over 600,000 participants, with the most grievous sentiments, mourned Comrade J.V. Stalin, the most respected friend and teacher of the Chinese people.

Tiananmen Square was filled with solemnity. The presidium of the congress was set up in front of Tiananmen. At the very center of the presidium, on the red wall of Tiananmen, hung a huge portrait of Comrade Stalin, surrounded by red and black gauze ribbons and pine branches. The national flags of China and the Soviet Union were hung on both sides, with black ribbons sewn to the top of the flags. On Tiananmen, a huge banner with silver characters on a black background read: "Comrade Stalin Will Live Forever." On the two long platforms on both sides of the presidium, nearly ten thousand wreaths presented by people from all walks of life were placed.

Attending the memorial service were members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and heads of various departments of the CPC Central Committee, members of the Central People's Government Committee, heads of the Central People's Government and its various academies, commissions, administrations, ministries, associations, and banks, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, senior generals of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, heads of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations, responsible cadres of the leading organs of the North China Region and Beijing's Party, government, and military, as well as members of the Tibetan Delegation.

Also attending the memorial service were Soviet experts working in Beijing to assist our country in its construction.

Also attending the memorial service were workers from factories and mines in Beijing, suburban farmers, people of various ethnic minorities, troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, working cadres of various organs and organizations, teachers and students from various schools, and people from industry and commerce, as well as other people from all walks of life in Beijing. They came here from all directions. Workers, farmers, and students from Mentougou, Changxindian, Liulihe, Shijingshan, Fengtai, Jiulongshan and other places dozens of miles away and in the suburbs set off in formation early in the morning. Starting at twelve noon, the giant stream of people—masses of people with black纱armbands—began to silently walk towards Tiananmen Square. Within two or three hours, Tiananmen Square and the wide East and West Chang'an Avenues extending more than six miles east and west from here were densely packed with contingents of people who came to mourn Comrade Stalin.

Also attending the memorial service were Soviet Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the People's Republic of China, P.F. Yudin, and representatives from the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Zhukov.

Also attending the memorial service were diplomatic envoys and embassy staff from various countries stationed in China, and commercial delegations from various countries currently in Beijing. In addition, there were peace activists from Japan, the United States, New Zealand, Mexico, and the United Kingdom currently in Beijing.

The presidium of the memorial service consisted of 34 people, including Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhu Xuefan, Li Jishen, Li Siguang, Wu Yuzhang, He Xiangning, Shen Yanbing, Lin Boqu, Hu Yaobang, Liu Xia·Tudengdaba, Gao Gang, Ulanhu, Ma Xulun, Chen Yun, Chen Shutong, Zhang Lan, Zhang Xiruo, Xu Guangping, Xu Deheng, Xi Zhongxun, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Peng Zemin, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Liu Shaoqi, Liu Geping, Deng Xiaoping, Deng Zihui, Lai Ruoyu, Burhan, and Bo Yibo, Rao Shushi.

At 4:54 PM, Peng Zhen announced the start of the memorial service. Peng Zhen said: Comrade Stalin, the great teacher of the working people of the world, passed away at 9:50 PM on March 5th. The people of China feel infinite grief. In order to express our deep condolences for our great teacher and most beloved friend, Comrade Stalin, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the people of Beijing are holding a memorial service here today.

Then, the band played funeral music. At 5:00 PM—the moment when Stalin's funeral was being held in Moscow—the entire venue observed a five-minute silence. At the same time, 28 salvos of artillery were fired in mourning; the sirens of all factories and trains in Beijing sounded in unison, and all vehicles moving within the city stopped. Pedestrians automatically stood in silence to express their condolences. The entire city was immersed in deep sorrow. The venue was very quiet. People shed tears as they remembered Stalin's concern for the Chinese people and his assistance to the Chinese revolution, and there was low sobbing everywhere. At this moment, Comrade Stalin's funeral was being held in Moscow; our great teacher and most beloved friend had bid farewell to us forever. At this moment, memorial services were being held in more than 2,000 cities and countless villages across China. At this moment, the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union were saying goodbye to Stalin with equally infinite grief. In the hearts of the people of the two countries, Moscow and Beijing are without distance. The unbreakable great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is something no force can separate.

At 5:05 PM, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman of the Central People's Government, and Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, presented a wreath to Stalin's portrait.

Zhu De, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice Chairman of the Central People’s Government, and Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a memorial speech (full text on page 2).

The more than 600,000 participants at the memorial service left the venue slowly with heavy but firm hearts. They resolved to unite even more closely around Chairman Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, and, together with the Soviet people, to more firmly support and trust the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government headed by Comrade Malenkov, and to advance victoriously in the direction indicated by the immortal Stalin.
