    For a Happy Life
    Bai Yuan
    In the winter of 1951, in Linru County, Henan Province, a group of farmers who had participated in the Huai River project were walking along a winding road. There were a dozen of them, each carrying bedding, talking loudly and excitedly as they walked. When they saw the houses of Xiewan Village in the distance, they quickened their pace. Everyone who returns home from afar has various feelings, but none felt as warm as they did now, their hearts filled with so much anticipation. Linru County, Henan Province, used to be a place plagued by bandits and robbers. Looking around from the road these dozen farmers were walking on, the vast land was dotted with towering stockaded villages. In the long, dark years of the past, local tyrants and bullies occupied this vast land. They built many villages into sturdy fortresses, leading their own men to kill and plunder everywhere. Among the many fortresses, a small village nestled at the foot of a mountain, that was Xiewan Village. From Xiewan Village, bending along the foot of the mountain into the mountains, there were several other villages, collectively called Huanglong Township. In the past, this was a place where the oppressed lived. High mountains sandwiched the village on both sides. The steep Xier River poured down from the high mountains, flowing swiftly through the gully. Scattered on the hillside were patches of barren land, and even this land did not belong to those poor and hungry people. Since the liberation of this area in the winter of 1948, the people had established their own regime, eliminated the bandits, and then carried out land reform. Now, these people who had participated in the Huai River project had also witnessed the great construction of the country with their own eyes, so they were naturally full of anticipation for their future lives. As they walked, they talked about the things on the Huai River construction site, and the things they were concerned about in their hometown. "If we do things like the Huai River project, what do you think our place will be like in a few years?" one person asked. Then, another person said, "It would be great if we could build a reservoir here." "I don't think building a reservoir is that urgent. Right now, it would be good if the water from our Xier River could irrigate the land on our hillside," said an old man of sixty named Fu Tianyou.
    He was an old farmer from Xiewan Village who had suffered all his life. Before liberation, Fu Tianyou's family did not own a single piece of land. When he was six years old, his father starved to death because of a drought in his hometown. The family had nothing to eat or drink. It was winter at that time, and every day Fu Tianyou carried a small basket to the hillside, picking up some sweet potato roots from other people's fields to take home. The cold winter had frozen the land hard, and the sweet potato roots buried in the ground could not be dug out by hand, so Fu Tianyou squatted alone on the hillside, waiting for the sun to thaw the frozen land... With great difficulty, he grew to be nine years old, and Fu Tianyou went out to work for the landlord's family, feeding livestock, farming, and driving carts, working as a hired hand for more than forty years. Decades of wind and sand made Fu Tianyou's eyes water whenever he was in the wind. The year his hometown was liberated, a Captain Feng led a team through Xiewan Village and said to everyone in the village: "We have come here with two hoes. The landlords and rich men say that the poor have poor roots and the rich have rich roots. With these two hoes, one will dig out the rich roots of the landlords and rich men, and the other will dig out our poor roots. From now on, new seedlings will be planted." Then, the people's regime was established in his hometown, and later land reform was carried out. The farmers who had no land were given land, just as Captain Feng said, the rich roots of the landlords and rich men were dug out, and at the same time, everyone's poor roots were dug out. When the news of the People's Government calling on the people to participate in the Huai River project came to Xiewan Village, Fu Tianyou went to the village chief to sign up. But the village chief did not approve, saying to him: "Fu Tianyou, you are already sixty years old. Stay in the village and work on production with everyone. Let the young people go to the Huai River project." A day later, Fu Tianyou went to the district to see the district chief and asked to sign up for the Huai River project. The district chief said: "The reason why we don't want you to go is because you are old, and the work there is more tiring. We are afraid of harming your health. Staying at home and working on production with everyone is the same." But no matter what, Fu Tianyou insisted on going. Finally, the district agreed to him, but told him that if it was too tiring there, they would send someone to replace him. So Fu Tianyou and a dozen other people from the township who participated in the Huai River project went to the Huai River construction site in Baisha Town, Yuxian County, with the Huai River Brigade organized by the county. It was October at this time.
    North of Baisha Town, there was a very wide canyon. The towering Xiaoyao Ridge stood on the east side of this canyon, and on the west side, under a steep cliff, was the turbulent Black Dragon Pool. To the north of this canyon was a range of overlapping mountains. There was a river here called the Ying River. It was a tributary of the upper reaches of the Huai River. In normal times, it looked like a silver ribbon, winding through the undulating mountains and flowing through the Black Dragon Pool; but when the flood season came, it carried all the floods rushing down from the mountains, surging and rushing out of the entire canyon to join the flooding of the entire Huai River basin. Now, according to the Huai River project plan, people were going to build a reservoir here. When the floods came, all the floods would be contained in the vast mountains north of the canyon, and then slowly released from the sluice gates to irrigate the land in the Huai River basin.
    When Fu Tianyou and the others went to the construction site, some projects had already started. From the bottom of that canyon, along the Ying River, all the way to the distant foot of the mountains, light railways were laid. A vast crowd of people worked day and night: digging tunnels, transporting equipment, building dikes, digging river channels... The sky shook with bursts of explosions; on the steep rocks, flashes of explosions sparkled. When the electric lights of the night came on, loud songs were broadcast from the construction site's loudspeakers, and the crowd churned like waves in that ocean of land... On the first day they arrived at the construction site, Fu Tianyou and the others had not yet started work. At night, Fu Tianyou and a few other people from the village who had come to participate in the Huai River project stood outside the work shed, looking at the construction site. At this time, Fu Tianyou suddenly remembered what Captain Feng had said: "...one hoe to dig out the rich roots of the landlords and rich men, and one hoe to dig out our poor roots. From now on, new seedlings will be planted." It seemed that only now did he fully understand the meaning of these words. Now, he saw with his own eyes how new seedlings were being planted. Captain Feng's words made him think a lot at this time. He thought about the past, he thought about the future, and at the same time he thought: since he had suffered for others all his life in the past, then for the sake of the beautiful days of the future, what could he not do?
    In the large canyon from Xiaoyao Ridge to Black Dragon Pool, a 300-meter-long dam of the reservoir was to be built to block the entire canyon. The project that the Linru County laborers participated in was the construction of the dam. At first, their job was to pan for sand and dig pebbles in the river. The water in the river was already very cold at this time, especially in the morning, standing barefoot in the water felt like being pricked by needles. But Fu Tianyou stood in the water all day long, bending over. He panned for sand basket after basket, or reached into the river with both hands to dig out the pebbles, letting others transport them to the shore, never asking to be replaced. When it was time to rest, he often refused to rest. Then, they began to build the dam. It was really like what the storytellers said: when you looked down at the bottom of the canyon, you saw a surging crowd of people drilling around; when it was time to stop work, that overwhelming crowd dispersed, and when you looked there again, a mountain ridge had suddenly grown up on the flat ground. Every day, before dawn, Fu Tianyou got up from the work shed. Before everyone else was up, he was already fumbling around there alone. If the hoe handle of his hoe was loose, he would take it outside and knock it; if a basket was broken, he would repair it. On the dam that was being piled higher and higher day by day, Fu Tianyou never stopped running around carrying stones or carrying sand. The northwest wind blew colder and colder every day. When the water of the entire Ying River had frozen over, the reservoir project was stopped at this time.
    Fu Tianyou and the people from his hometown who participated in the Huai River project returned to Huanglong Township, their minds always filled with the scenes of the reservoir construction site: that surging crowd of people working day and night, those electric lights all over the mountains and plains, those flashes of explosions... The quiet Xier River was now frozen. Every day Fu Tianyou saw it, he thought of the reservoir project. One day, he stood on the earthen cliff next to his house. The Xier River lay below that earthen cliff. Scattered on the high hillside were patches of dry land. Seeing those lands would make people think more. The pitiful footprints that Fu Tianyou left on that hillside when he was six years old, the emaciated shadows of those who starved to death, the helpless tears shed by the mothers who sold their children under those hillsides... In those long and tragic years, people lived under the rule of darkness, hunger, and death for dozens of generations, and no one ever thought that they could change their entire lives. Now, those terrible days were gone, and would never return. However, those dry lands on the hillsides, which were dry every year, still threatened people's lives. The water of the Xier River flowed continuously year after year, but there was no way to irrigate the land on the hillside. If it didn't rain, the entire village would have no harvest at all. As Fu Tianyou stood on that earthen cliff watching, he thought: "If such a large project as a reservoir can be built, can't we get the water from this Xier River to run up the hillside?"
    A day later, Fu Tianyou and several other people from the same township who had participated in the Huai River project quietly walked up the Xier River. Steep cliffs stood on both sides of the river. They climbed all the way to the highest hillside, and then walked along the mountains, covering every piece of land scattered on the winding hillside. As they walked, they talked about how to get the water from the Xier River to the mountains. "Let's do it like at the reservoir, let's tunnel through the mountains," Fu Tianyou said. But to figure out how to do it, we had to have a plan first. So Fu Tianyou gathered together the dozen or so people in the township who had participated in the Huai River project, and ran up the Xier River to the mountains countless times before they came up with their plan. According to their plan, they intended to dig two channels in the mountains, starting from the source of the Xier River, one digging into the eastern mountain on the left side of the river, and one digging into the western mountain on the right side of the river. On the high mountains through which these two channels passed, they needed to dig sixteen large and small tunnels, and also build many earthen dams to connect the dozens of zhang high cliffs. They told the township government about their plan, and the township government convened the people of the entire township to discuss it, and then reported it to the district. The district government replied: "If you think you can do it, then go ahead!" In those days, Fu Tianyou kept calculating in his mind: if it doesn't work out halfway, and the manpower is wasted on this in vain, how many people will scold us! Fu Tianyou gathered all the people who had participated in the Huai River project together, and after discussing it, everyone said: "Let's do it!"
    After the Spring Festival, everything was ready. The people participating in the digging of the channels had already been organized into groups. The hoes and baskets had also been repaired. The district government had also obtained a water conservancy loan for them from the county. On that morning, when Fu Tianyou got out of bed, the stars were still hanging in the sky. But when he opened the door and walked outside, wisps of smoke had already risen above the entire village. Early in the morning, Fu Tianyou led the people up the mountain. The weather was still very cold at this time. The ground was frozen. It was difficult to start work. With one hoe stroke, they could only dig a few fen deep. On a steep cliff, several young people were digging in the dirt together. One of the young men, in his twenties, with a white towel wrapped around his head, sang as he dug: "We are the labor army for harnessing the Huai River..." This was a song he had sung at the reservoir construction site. "Is this how we're going to harness the Huai River?" one next to him said jokingly. "That's right, anyway, everything is done by people," he replied, and continued to sing.
    Next to another cliff, Fu Tianyou and several other people were digging a tunnel. In order to prepare the entrance, they had to first flatten half of the hillside from the top of the mountain. The wind on the mountain made Fu Tianyou's eyes water. People worked non-stop. The sun quickly shone overhead. After Fu Tianyou leveled the earthen slope in front of him, he used a hoe to push some of the loose soil scattered at his feet down the hillside, and was about to take off his cotton-padded jacket when he looked up and saw groups of women walking out of the village carrying rice pots. In order not to hinder the work on the mountain, they waited until everyone was together in the village, and then brought the food up the mountain together.
    People worked all day long. In the evening, they lit lanterns to continue their work. People in many nearby villages saw those flickering lights from afar, and were spreading rumors: "The people of Huanglong Township are going to build a reservoir." Some people didn't believe it, and said: "Nonsense!" After working day and night, the tunnel that Fu Tianyou and the others were digging had already gone in more than a zhang. But the deeper they dug, the more concerned they had to be. Fu Tianyou often ran out of the tunnel to check whether the entrance was strong, and then climbed to the top to look around, listening to the sound of the hoes striking in the tunnel, measuring the surroundings with his steps to see if the direction of the digging was correct. Fu Tianyou looked at the top of the mountain for a long time, then picked up the lantern and walked down. "Just like at the reservoir construction site, the only thing missing is a loudspeaker..." Fu Tianyou thought, filled with joy.
    The days passed quickly. The people of Huanglong Township dug through one tunnel after another. Tall earthen dams stood towering between many cliffs. The Xier River shed its ice in the warm sun. In March, the people who had participated in the Huai River project were preparing to go to the reservoir construction site again. Fu Tianyou and the people of the township arranged the affairs of the township, reorganized the people who were left in the township to build the channels, and went to the reservoir construction site with everyone.
    However, not long after they arrived at the reservoir construction site, they received a letter from the township saying that the township's channel could not be dug and had been stopped. After receiving the letter, Fu Tianyou was extremely anxious. After discussing it with the team headquarters, he carried his bedding on his back and walked back alone over mountains and ridges that same day. The next day, Fu Tianyou returned to Huanglong Township when it was almost dusk. He didn't even enter the village, but followed a small path to the mountain. Quietly, there was no one on the mountain. He felt the cave walls as he passed through one dark tunnel after another that had already been dug. On a highest cliff, there was a newly dug tunnel, with many uncleared piles of earth at the entrance, and many small pieces of rock scattered around. It was obvious that this was an unfinished tunnel. Fu Tianyou walked into the tunnel from a small path dug on the cliff. After walking only a few steps, he reached out and felt around, and all around were jagged rocks. "So that's what's going on..." he thought as he walked out of the tunnel, down the mountain, and went straight to the township government. The people in the village knew that Fu Tianyou had returned from the reservoir, and they all ran over. As soon as they saw Fu Tianyou, many people said: "I'm afraid our project won't be completed." Some people even said: "If it can be completed, unless we transfer the hundreds of thousands of people who built the reservoir to our place. Just relying on our few hoes and hammers, how can we drill through that stone cave?" Fu Tianyou said: "Those hundreds of thousands of people didn't all go there to drill one tunnel. Such a large mountain as the reservoir was tunneled through, why can't we tunnel through this?" He also told the township government that he would lead a group of people to drill the tunnel with the rocks, and no matter how long it took, they would have to drill through it, and he would be responsible if they couldn't drill through it in the future.
    Fu Tianyou walked out of the township government, went home and had a quick dinner, then took a hammer, brought the bedding that had not yet been unpacked, and walked out of the house. Then, the village cadres picked up the loudspeaker and broadcast, and the people brought their furniture and followed Fu Tianyou up the mountain. The suspended project started again. When they arrived at the mountain, Fu Tianyou put the bedding next to the entrance of the cave, and led his group of people to clang and bang in the cave. The hammer struck the hard rocks, bursting with many sparkling sparks. This was a tunnel that needed to be drilled for twenty-one zhang to be tunneled through, and no one knew how many rocks there were inside. It would be great if there was a drilling machine, but it was not yet possible. We don't have so many machines yet. Machines also have to be created laboriously from life, and they also have to grow out of the fertile land. However, Fu Tianyou had long thought about it: as long as people have a life they can look forward to in their hearts, anything can be done. In this way, he and everyone else,
    never stopped hitting one hard rock after another in the cave,
    until late at night, when everyone stopped work, he slept in the cave. Before dawn, he picked up the hammer and started drilling in the cave again. It wasn't until Fu Tianyou's tiger's mouths on both hands were cracked with blood from the hammer, and he had dug the tunnel more than ten zhang deep, that he finished drilling the rocks in the cave.
    In April, after Fu Tianyou and the others tunneled through that cave, the projects for both channels were completed. When the spring breeze blew through the green leaves on the mountain, and the water of the Xier River quietly passed through those winding tunnels, flowing through the air along the water troughs on the dozens of zhang long earthen dams, irrigating more than 2,300 mu of dry land scattered on the mountain, Fu Tianyou came to the reservoir construction site again. At this time, the reservoir dam was almost completed. A majestic mountain ridge standing up from the flat ground connected the large canyon from Xiaoyao Ridge to Black Dragon Pool, blocking the vast mountains to the north in the high sky. The beautiful river water flowed through the reservoir's water conveyance tunnel, flowing gurgling under the arches of the tunnel. The days that the Chinese people have dreamed of for generations have begun from this moment.

    为了幸福的生活
    白原
    一九五一年的冬天，在河南省临汝县，有一群参加治淮回来的农民，在一条弯弯曲曲的道路上走着。他们一共十几个人，每人都背着铺盖，一边走着一边兴高采烈地在高声谈说。当他们远远地看见谢湾村的房子，就加快了脚步。每一个离家的人回到了家乡，都有过各种各样的心情，但谁也没有像他们现在所感觉到的这样温暖，在心里充满着这样多的想望。河南省临汝县，曾经是一个土匪遍地，强盗出没的地方。就在那十几个农民所走的路上向四面望去，一片辽阔的土地上散布着一座座耸立的砦墙。在过去那长久的黑暗的年代，土豪恶霸盘据着这一片辽阔的土地。他们把许多乡村筑成坚固的砦子，带领着各自的人马到处残杀和劫掠。在许多砦子中间，有一个小小的村子躲在一个山根根上，那就是谢湾村。从谢湾村沿着山根弯到山里去，里面还有几个村子，合起来就叫黄龙乡。在从前，这曾经是一个受欺压的人们所居住的地方。高高的山峦从两旁把村子夹在下面。一条陡急的洗耳河从高山上倾泻下来，在山沟里急急地流着。散布在山坡上的是一块块贫瘠的土地，而且就是这样的土地，也不属于那些穷困和饥饿的人们。自从一九四八年冬天这个地方解放以后，人民建立了自己的政权，肃清了土匪，接着又进行了土地改革。现在，这些参加治淮的人们又亲眼看见了国家的伟大建设，他们对于未来的生活，当然要充满想望了。他们一路走着，一路谈说着治淮工地上的事情，他们所牵挂的家乡的事情。“像治淮那样搞起来，你说再过几年，咱们这里要变成个啥样子？”有一个人问。接着，另一个人就说：“要是在咱这儿也修起个水库来，那才美呢。”“我看水库修不修倒不很急，眼下咱们那一道洗耳河的水，要能灌灌咱们山坡上的地就好了。”说这话的是个六十岁的老汉，叫傅天佑。
    这是谢湾村的一个苦了一辈子的老农民。解放以前，傅天佑家里没有一块田。当他六岁那年，因为家乡闹旱灾，父亲活活被饿死了。一家人没有吃没有喝。那时候正是冬天，傅天佑每天从家里提着一个小小的筐篮到山坡上，在别人的地里拾一些红薯根根拿回家去。寒冷的冬天把土地都冻硬了，埋在地里的红薯根用手挖不出来，傅天佑就一个人蹲在山坡上，等着太阳化开冻结的土地，……好不容易才长到九岁，傅天佑就出去给地主家里喂牲口，种地，赶大车，一直当了四十几年长工。几十年的风沙吹得傅天佑的双眼一见风就淌眼泪。家乡解放那一年，有一个冯队长带着一支队伍路过谢湾村，在村里对大伙儿说：“我们到这里来，是带着两把镢头来的。地主老财说，穷有穷根，富有富根。我们这两把镢头，一把要把地主老财的富根挖掉，一把要把咱们的穷根挖掉。从今以后，要把新的根苗栽起来。”接着，家乡建立了人民的政权，后来又进行了土地改革，没有土地的农民分到了土地，正像那个冯队长说的一样，挖掉了地主老财的富根，同时又把大伙儿的穷根挖掉了。人民政府号召人民参加治淮的消息来到谢湾村，傅天佑就到村长那里去报名。可是村长没有批准，对他说：“傅天佑，你今年已经六十了，在村里和大家把生产搞好吧。治淮的事，让青年们去就行了。”过了一天，傅天佑又跑到区上去见了区长，要求报名去治淮。区长说：“不让你去，是因为你年纪老了，那里的活做起来比较累，怕搞坏身体，留在家里把大家的生产搞好也是一样。”但是不管怎样说，傅天佑非要去不行。最后区上答应了他，但是告诉他说：要是在那边太累了，就派人去换他回来。于是傅天佑就和乡里参加治淮的十几个人一起，随着县里组成的治淮大队到了禹县白沙镇的治淮工地上。这时正是十月里。
    在白沙镇北面，有一个很宽的山峡。高耸的逍遥岭屹立在这个山峡的东边，在西边一座陡峭的悬崖下，则是激流滚滚的黑龙潭。在这个山峡北面，是一片重重叠叠的群山。在这里有一条河流叫颍河。这是淮河上游的一条支流。在平常的时候，它好像一条银色的带子一样穿过起伏的群山，经过黑龙潭蜿蜒地流着；可是洪水的时期一到，它就带着所有从山上冲下来的洪水，奔腾澎湃地从整个山峡冲出来，去参加整个淮河流域的泛滥。现在，按照治淮的计划，人们要在这里把一座水库建造起来。在洪水到来的时候，把所有的洪水关在山峡北面那一片茫茫的群山里面，然后再慢慢地把它从水闸里放出来灌溉淮河流域的土地。
    傅天佑他们去到工地的时候，有一些工程早就已经开了工。从那一个山峡下面开始，沿着颍河，一直到那遥远的山根根前都铺了轻便铁道。遍野的人群日夜不息地在劳作着：开凿隧洞，输送器材，建筑堤岸，开挖河道，……。”天空上震荡着一阵阵爆炸的巨响；在那壁立的岩石上，闪耀着一朵朵爆炸的火光。黑夜的电灯一亮，从工地的播音筒里放送着嘹亮的歌声，人群在那一片大地的海洋里翻卷着波浪，……。刚到工地那一天，傅天佑他们还没有上工。夜里，傅天佑和本村一同来参加治淮的几个人站在工棚外面往工地上望着。这时候傅天佑突然想起那个冯队长所说的话来：“……一把镢头把地主老财的富根挖掉，一把镢头把咱们的穷根挖掉。从今以后，要把新的根苗栽起来。”似乎一直到现在，他才完全明白了这些话所包含的意思。现在，他亲眼看见新的根苗怎样在栽起来。冯队长的话在这时候使他想着很多的事情。他想着过去，想着将来，同时他想着：既然在过去，为了别人受苦受了一辈子，那么为了将来千秋万载的美好的日子，他什么不能够做出来呢？
    在逍遥岭到黑龙潭这个大山峡里，要建筑一座一个三百公尺长的水库的大坝，把整个山峡堵起来。临汝县民工所参加的工程，就是建筑大坝的工程。起初他们的工作是在河里淘沙子，挖卵石。这时候河里的水已经很凉了，尤其在早上，赤着脚站在水里好像针扎一样。但是傅天佑整天整天地弯着腰站在水里。他一筐又一筐地在淘着沙子，或者把两只手伸到河里去把卵石挖出来，让别人运到岸上去，总不叫人家替换。该休息的时候，他常常也不肯休息。接着就开始打坝了。真是好像说故事的人所说的一样：当你往那山峡底下看着，只见一片汹涌的人群在钻动；等到收工的时候，那一片遮天盖地的人群散开来，你再往那里一看，平地上一下子就长起了一座山梁。每天，总是天还没有亮，傅天佑就从工棚里爬起来。大家都还没有起床，他就一个人在那里摸摸这摸摸那。那一把镢头的镢把松了，他就拿到外面去敲敲；那一只筐子破了，他就把它修修补补。在一天比一天堆得更高起来的大坝上，傅天佑从没有一天停息地抬着石头，或者挑着沙土在奔跑。西北风一天比一天寒冷地吹着。等到整条颍河的流水通通都结了冰，水库工程就在这时候停了工。
    傅天佑和本乡参加治淮的人们回到了黄龙乡，心里老是忘不了水库工地上的情景：那一片日夜不息地汹涌着的人群，那满山遍野的电灯，那些爆炸的火光，……。静静的洗耳河现在已经结了冰。傅天佑每天一看见它就想起水库的工程来。有一天，他站在他家旁边的土崖上。洗耳河就在那个土崖下面躺着。散布在那高高的山坡上的全是一块块干旱的土地。看见那些土地，就会使人想得更多。六岁时候的傅天佑在那个山坡上所留下的那些可怜的脚印，那些饿死了的人们的瘦骨嶙嶙的影子，把孩子卖出去以后的母亲在那些山坡下所滴下的无告的眼泪，……。在那长久的悲惨的年月里，人们在黑暗、饥饿和死亡的统治下过了几十百代，谁也没想过能把整个生活改变过来。现在，那些可怕的日子已经过去了，永远也不会再回来了。但是，那些山坡上的年年干旱的土地，依然威胁着人们的生活。洗耳河的流水，年年都在不断地流着，却没法灌溉那山坡上的土地。如果天不下雨，整个乡村就没有一点收成。傅天佑一边站在那个土崖上看着，一边就想：“水库那么大的工程都能建筑起来，这一道洗耳河的水就不能叫它跑到山坡上去？”
    隔了一天，傅天佑和几个一同参加治淮的乡里人悄悄地沿着洗耳河往上走。沿河两岸峭壁屹立。他们一直爬到那最高的山坡上，然后又沿着山峦走遍每块散布在弯弯曲曲的山坡上的土地。他们一路走着一路谈着，看怎样想法把洗耳河的水引到山上来。“咱们就像水库上一样，把山都给它凿通了，”傅天佑说。但是怎样弄法，得先有个计划才成。于是傅天佑就在乡里把参加治淮的十几个人都找在一起，又沿着洗耳河往山上跑了不知多少次，才把他们的计划弄出来。按照他们的计划，打算在山上挖两条水道，从洗耳河的源头上开始，一条往河左边的东山上挖，一条往河右边的西山上挖。在这两条水道所经过的高山上，需要打通十六个大大小小的山洞，而且还要筑起许多土坝把几十丈高的山崖连接起来。他们把计划告诉乡政府，由乡政府召集全乡的人们进行了讨论，然后就向区上打报告。区政府答复说：“你们看能搞得成就搞吧！”那几天，在傅天佑的心里就一直在盘算着：如果半路搞不成，白白把人力浪费在这上面，那可要遭多少人骂呵！傅天佑把所有参加治淮的人找在一起，商量了商量，大伙说：“咱们干吧！”
    过了春节，一切都准备好了。参加挖水道的人们已经编了组。镢头、筐子也都修理好。区政府又从县里给他们领来了水利贷款。那一天早上，傅天佑从床上起来的时候，天空上还挂着星星。可是等他开门走到外面一看，整个村庄的上空都已经升起了一缕一缕的炊烟。一早，傅天佑就领着人们上了山。这时候天气还很冷。地面冻结着。开始工作很艰难，一镢头下去，只能挖几分深。在一个陡峭的山崖上，几个青年人正在那里一起挖着泥土。其中有一个二十几岁、头上包着一块白毛巾的青年人一边挖着，一边就唱起来：“咱们是治淮的劳动大军，……”这是他在水库工地上唱过的歌。“淮河就像咱们这样治法？”挨着他旁边的一个开玩笑地说。“就是这样，反正什么都是人干出来的，”他回答了一句，又继续唱起来。
    在另一个山崖的旁边，傅天佑和几个人在一起开挖一个山洞。为了要把洞口打好，他们得首先从山顶上把半个山坡削平。山上的风吹得傅天佑老是淌着眼泪。人们不停息地劳作着。太阳很快就照到头顶上来了。傅天佑把自己面前的一个土坡挖平以后，用镢头把散落在脚下的一些碎土拨到了山坡下面，正想把身上的棉袄脱下来，一抬头，就看见妇女们一群一群地挑着饭罐子从村里走出来。为了不妨碍山上的劳作，她们在村里等齐了，然后大家一起把饭送到山上。
    人们劳作了一整天。到晚上，他们就把灯笼点起来继续他们的工程。附近许多村子里的人们远远地看到那一闪一闪的灯光，都在传说着：“黄龙乡的人们要修水库了。”有的人不相信，就说：“瞎胡闹呢！”经过白天和晚上的劳作，傅天佑他们打的那个山洞已经打进去一丈多。但是愈打得深就得愈加操心。傅天佑常常从洞里跑出来，留心看看洞口结实不结实，然后又爬到顶上，看看这边又看看那边，听听洞里的镢头的凿击声，用脚步量着周围，看看打的方向对不对。傅天佑在山顶上看了好一会，然后提着灯笼走下来。“就像在水库工地上一样，只差没有安上播音器，……”傅天佑想着，怀着满心的欢喜。
    日子过得很快。黄龙乡的人们打通了一个山洞又
    一个山洞。高高的土坝在许多山崖中间耸立起来。洗耳河在温暖的太阳下脱出了冰块。三月一到，参加治淮的人们又准备到水库工地去了。傅天佑和乡里的人们把乡里的事情安排了一下，把留在乡里建筑水道的人们重新编了组，就和大家一起到水库工地去了。
    可是，他们到了水库工地没有多久，就接到乡里寄去一封信，说乡里的水道挖不成，停工了。傅天佑接到信以后，急得不行，和队部里商量了商量，当天就背着铺盖，一个人爬山越岭地往回走。第二天，傅天佑回到黄龙乡的时候，已经快到黄昏。他连村子也没有进，就顺着一条小路走到山上去。静悄悄地，山上没有一个人。他摸着洞壁从一个个已经打好的黑暗的山洞里穿过去。在一座最高的悬崖上，有一个新凿的山洞，洞口堆着许多没有清除的土块，周围还撒下许多细碎的石头。一看就知道这是一个没有挖成的山洞。傅天佑从一条在悬崖上凿出来的细小的道路走进洞里去，没有走上几步，伸手一摸，周围全是嶙峋的岩石。“原来是这么回事，……”他一边想着一边从山洞里走出来，下了山，就一直走到乡政府去。村子里的人们知道傅天佑已从水库上回来，也都跑来了。一见傅天佑，许多人就说：“咱们的工程怕完不成了。”有的人还说：“要能完成，除非把修水库的几十万人都调到咱们这里来。单凭咱们这几把镢头和几把铁锤，怎样也把那石头洞凿不穿。”傅天佑说：“人家几十万人也不是通通为了凿一个山洞去的。水库那么大的山都凿通了，咱们为什么凿不通？”他并且告诉乡政府说，那个有石头的山洞由他领着一个组的人去凿，无论凿多久也得把它凿通，将来凿不通由他负责。
    傅天佑从乡政府走出来，回到家里匆匆吃了一顿晚饭，就拿着一把铁锤，带上还没有打开的铺盖从家里走出来。接着，村里的干部们拿起广播筒一广播，人们就带上家具，跟着傅天佑上了山。停顿的工程又开了工。到了山上，傅天佑把铺盖往洞口旁边一搁，就领着他那一组的人们在洞里叮叮当当地敲起来。铁锤打着坚硬的岩石，爆着许多闪闪的火星。这是一个需要打二十一丈才能打通的山洞，而且里面究竟有多少石头，谁也不知道。要是有个钻探机就好了，但是现在还不可能。我们现在还没有那么多的机器。机器也得从生活里艰辛地创造出来，也得从丰饶的土地里生长出来。但是，傅天佑早就想过了：只要在人们心里有了可以想望的生活，什么事都能办得到。就这样，他和大家一起，
    一刻也不停地在山洞里敲打着一块块坚硬的岩石，
    一直到深夜，人们都收工了，他就睡在山洞里。天还没有亮，他又在山洞里拿起铁锤凿起来。一直到傅天佑两手的虎口上都被铁锤震裂了一道道血缝，把山洞挖了十多丈深的时候，才凿完了洞里的石头。
    四月里，傅天佑他们把那个山洞打通以后，两条水道的工程通通完成了。当春风吹动着山上的绿叶，洗耳河的流水安静地穿过那些曲折的山洞，沿着几十丈长的土坝上的水槽在空中流过，灌溉着散布在山上的二千三百多亩干旱的土地的时候，傅天佑又来到了水库工地上。这时候水库的大坝已经快要完成。一座从平地上矗立起来的巍峨的山梁把从逍遥岭到黑龙潭那个大山峡连接起来，在高空上遮挡着北面那一片茫茫的群山。美丽的河水穿过水库的输水隧道，在隧道的拱门下哗哗地流着。中国人民世世代代所梦想的日子就从此开始了。
