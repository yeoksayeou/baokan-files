　　Chen Bingji, director of the North China General Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, spoke at the meeting. After introducing the course of the "February 28th" Uprising and the situation of the Taiwan people's tenacious struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the past six years, he pointed out: In order to strive for the early liberation of Taiwan, everyone must carry forward the patriotism of the Taiwan people's "February 28th" Uprising and strive to victoriously complete the three major tasks of 1953.

　　Nine people, including Huang Shengqing, who participated in the "February 28th" Uprising, also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed that they would use practical actions in their current work posts and studies to strive for the complete victory of resisting America and aiding Korea and the early liberation of Taiwan.
