He Came From the Countryside
——One of the People Building Anshan
By our reporter Lu Hao

The first time Li Youcai came to Anshan, he couldn't sleep for several nights. Living in the countryside, he never dreamed that our Anshan would be so big, so beautiful, so extraordinary.

In the dozens of miles around Anshan, hundreds of chimneys spew out smoke of various colors, sometimes blocking the sun. The hot air rising from the cooling towers erected in the air rises slowly like huge clouds. At night, the sky over Anshan is half-red from the fire of smelting steel. After arriving in Anshan, Li Youcai often stood alone on the asphalt road in front of the Iron and Steel Company, watching these strange scenes. In addition, what particularly interested him was that he had seen the endless stream of people entering and leaving the company gate several times. Many of them were wearing new clothes, many were riding dazzling new bicycles, and some were even sitting in comfortable GAZ-type cars. He asked his cousin, "What do they do?" His cousin told him, "They are all workers."

Li Youcai fell in love with Anshan after one trip. He felt that living in the countryside was of course much better than in the past. He didn't have an inch of land in the past, but now he has been allocated twenty acres. But as soon as he saw Anshan, he saw places he never dreamed of in the past, and he became dissatisfied with his original life. When he especially learned that the steel produced here would be used to manufacture a huge number of rails, as well as indispensable materials such as trains, cars, and tractors for our motherland, he began to think about becoming a worker in this city.

When Anshan began large-scale construction in the summer of 1952, his wish was finally realized. Like many farmers from the countryside, he got a job as a concrete worker at the Anshan large-scale construction site.

Li Youcai found everything new when he started working. That all-purpose loading and unloading vehicle can load thousands of kilograms of cement in one go, not only carrying it around, but also unloading it by itself. Objects weighing tens of thousands of kilograms, the crane can lift them wherever they need to go, like an eagle catching a chick. Concrete workers working in the "foundation" are also given gloves, new canvas work clothes, and long rubber boots by the public. It's exciting to say that a month's salary can buy a strong little donkey, which is much better than farming. However, there were also awkward things in Li Youcai's heart. For example, he had to queue up to buy tickets for meals, which was not as good as sitting on the heated kang at home, where his wife would bring the food to him. Sometimes, when it was windy and rainy, he couldn't stay at home and had to go to work. Although Li Youcai worked according to the rules of the workers, some old things still haunted his mind.

Once, when he was off work, Li Youcai had a pair of newly bought sneakers slung over his shoulders, one in front and one in back. He was dragging his large, long rubber boots that he wore at work, preparing to go home. It happened that he ran into the branch secretary just as he stepped onto the road. When the branch secretary saw him walking like this, his eyes naturally fell on his feet. He said, "Li Youcai, why are you carrying your shoes on your shoulders and wearing public rubber boots home?"

Li Youcai was very embarrassed at this time. He couldn't answer the question raised by the branch secretary.

The branch secretary continued relentlessly, "If the stove in the house is broken, or the door is broken, everyone knows to replace a brick or nail a tack. If your own sneakers are worn a little to one side, you also know to go to the street to glue a heel. Why don't you cherish the public's rubber boots like this?" As soon as he finished speaking, the branch secretary was hurriedly called to a meeting by someone from the team headquarters. The burly Li Youcai was stunned, his face flushed. He sat down and slowly changed into his new sneakers.

During the days Li Youcai was in the concrete team, he often heard the branch secretary say things like: We the working class should do this and that. He didn't understand it at first, but after a while, he felt that what the branch secretary said was not so simple. Li Youcai, who originally thought he knew a lot of things in the countryside, always felt that he was somewhat lacking here. During those days when the project was tight, he saw that the thin branch secretary didn't go home to sleep at all. He spread his raincoat on the uneven tools in that windy and rainy shack, and that was where he slept at night. Sometimes, he simply sat next to the "foundation" and closed his eyes for a while. Once, it rained heavily in the middle of the night. In order to prevent the cement from being drenched by the rain, the branch secretary, in the pitch-black night, regardless of the rain making it impossible for him to open his eyes, mobilized everyone to find wooden poles and mats to build a shed. He was nearsighted and wore glasses. He fell down and got up. He ignored everything and climbed up the wooden poles that were swaying in the heavy wind and rain to cover the mats. When the workers were pouring cement, one named Hao Jinming found that the wooden formwork in one place was leaking slurry. Seeing that there was no way to fix it, he took off his single shirt and blocked the slurry. Later, the leadership praised him, and he said, "Slurry is like blood on a person's body. For the long-term plan and not to affect quality, this is the duty of the working class. There's nothing to say." These things stimulated Li Youcai a lot. He thought, others are willing to give up their lives for work and can endure any hardship. Sometimes he feels unhappy because he goes back a little late after a meeting. Others don't care about their clothes in order to ensure quality. He sees tacks and iron wires on the ground and doesn't even look at them. How can this be like the working class?

The four words "working class" were gathering its power on Li Youcai. What happened on the 18th "foundation" proved that Li Youcai was indeed moving forward.

The concrete project of the 18th "foundation" was nearing completion. The base below had been laid, and the small walls were being built on top. After the small walls were built, the 18th "foundation" could be considered complete.

Li Youcai was assigned to build the small wall on this "foundation" that night. While he was busy compacting it, he found that the stones he was compacting were a little dry due to lack of slurry. He looked at the cement sent by the crane. The slurry was a bit thick, but not like the cement in the "foundation". He knew that if there was too little slurry and only stones were left, it would be like a person having only bones and no blood, which would affect the quality of the project. By this time, it was already dark, and the dim lights left many places in the "foundation" in darkness. He couldn't figure out exactly where the problem was.

After a while, he found that the stones in the "foundation" seemed to be even drier. He looked at the "foundation" next to the wooden formwork, which was more than two meters deep and filled with wooden strips. After a person went down, they could only move sideways. Li Youcai didn't hesitate to crawl down. Sometimes he crawled slowly, sometimes he curled up into a ball, moving forward inch by inch. Under the "foundation", it was dark and he couldn't see anything. He had to feel along the joints of the wooden formwork with his hands. When he touched it, the bottom of the wooden formwork was uneven, with some steel bars and concrete exposed. Thin slurry flowed all over the bottom of the wooden boards. Li Youcai reached under the wooden boards with his hand, and slurry was flowing straight down from these places. Based on his short few months of experience working in the concrete team, he knew that if the slurry couldn't be retained, honeycombs and dog holes would inevitably occur inside. Li Youcai quickly climbed out of the "foundation" and found the foreman, Hou Baosheng. Li Youcai told him what had happened under the "foundation" from beginning to end. Finally, he said worriedly, "If the slurry leaks here, the quality cannot be guaranteed. We must quickly find a solution."

However, Hou Baosheng, who was dressed neatly and cleanly, reacted very coldly. He said, "It's nothing, it doesn't matter."

"How can it not matter? The slurry is almost leaking out."

"I said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. What do you know? Go and do your work quickly."

It was clear that there was a problem, but the foreman said it didn't matter. This confused an inexperienced concrete worker. Li Youcai helplessly walked back to the place he was originally compacting. He thought: The operating procedures clearly state this. If the stones don't have slurry, this won't become concrete. How can this be okay?

At this time, although Li Youcai's feet were still working hard to step on the cement, and his hands were still compacting, his heart was very uneasy. The more he thought about it, the more he couldn't figure it out. He couldn't make himself work as usual anymore.

He went back into the "foundation" again. Although his clothes were wet, his face was covered with beads of sweat, and his fingers were covered in white blisters because they had been immersed in the cement slurry for a long time. Some places were broken, and the cement was stuck to the bright red flesh, hurting all the way to his heart. Li Youcai endured the pain. After he crawled down, he continued to reach into the slurry with his hand, and gritted his teeth, leaning against the wooden mold and trying hard to reach upwards. His already broken fingers touched the hard stone, hurting so much that he shivered, but he ignored everything and reached inside, finally touching the cement that was about to solidify. There really were dog holes, some as big as a head. He thought: We are putting cement on top, but the bottom is empty. Big machines will be installed on top of the cement in the future. Isn't this fooling ourselves?

Li Youcai hurriedly went to find the foreman Hou Baosheng again. Li Youcai was a little anxious. After he told Hou Baosheng everything, he said, "Seeing that things are going bad, don't pour cement on this 'foundation' anymore."

The cement from the cement mixing plant was being transported by the crane, bucket by bucket, and continued to pour into the "foundation".

When Hou Baosheng saw Li Youcai like this, he thought he was making a fuss. He said impatiently, "No one is like you. When you're asked to work, you're always sick."

"Go and see for yourself and you'll know."
"It doesn't matter, no need to look. What are you so afraid of? If you're afraid, go work somewhere else."

"Why doesn't it matter? The bottom is empty. If it's not done well, it will have to be blasted and redone in the future. The long-term plan will become a short-term plan. I can't solve the problem by going to another place to work."

Hou Baosheng knew he was wrong, and he became somewhat evasive. He had no choice but to follow Li Youcai to the place where the problem occurred. Then, Li Youcai crawled with difficulty under the "foundation" again. In the darkness, he raised his head and said to Hou Baosheng, "Come down and take a look, and you'll know how big this problem is."

Hou Baosheng stood on the edge of the "foundation". He said, "Think of a way to fix it yourself."

"What can I do? I wouldn't need to find you if I could do it myself."
"You can plug it with your hand."

"Slurry isn't cotton. How can you plug it?" Li Youcai said loudly, "Aren't you going to come down and take a look? There's no man-killing knife hanging here. Why don't you come down?"

All that could be heard was Hou Baosheng mumbling something on top, not knowing what he was saying. Anyway, he didn't come down and couldn't see the situation below. At this time, technician Pan Diansong was walking to the 18th "foundation".

Li Youcai, because he didn't get any results from arguing with Hou Baosheng, climbed out from under the "foundation". He happened to see Pan Diansong, and he told Pan Diansong about this matter. After Xiao Pan listened, he immediately followed Li Youcai and crawled under the foundation. They walked from north to south, feeling as they went. The further south they went, the bigger the hole. The situation was very serious.

After Pan Diansong came up, it was almost midnight. He immediately made a phone call to the chief engineer of the construction site. The chief engineer was already asleep, but after hearing this report, he immediately went to the scene and had the carpenters remove the wooden boards. When he shone a flashlight on it, there were indeed big holes, some places were even empty, and in some places, the stones crumbled and fell when stepped on.

At this time, there was no other way to remedy it. They had to gather more concrete workers and remove all the cement that had been poured. Li Youcai forgot the pain of his broken and bleeding fingers. He didn't say a word. He was still one of the most active in the rework project of the small wall of this "foundation".

Only Hou Baosheng stood stiffly on the "foundation", not moving, as if he was in a daze, muttering, "How can this be true? How can this be true?" (Attached picture)

    他从乡下来
    ——建设鞍山的人们之一
    本报记者　陆灏
    李有财第一次来到鞍山的时候，他有好几夜都睡不着。在乡下过日子，梦想不到咱们的鞍山，是这样的大，这样好看，这样稀罕。
    在鞍山周围几十里路的地方，成百个烟囱所喷吐着的各色的烟，有时把太阳也遮蔽住了。矗立在空中的冷却塔所冒的热气，就像一大块一大块云彩似地冉冉上升。到晚上，鞍山的天空被熔炼钢铁的火光燃烧得半边通红。李有财到了鞍山以后，常常一个人站在钢铁公司门口的柏油马路上，看着这些奇怪的景象。除此以外，还特别引起他兴趣的，是他有几次看到在公司门口进进出出的川流不息的人群。他们很多都穿着新衣服，很多人骑着耀眼的新自行车，有的还坐着舒适的吉斯式的大汽车。他问他的表侄：“他们是做什么的？”表侄告诉他：“他们都是工人。”
    李有财来了一趟鞍山，他就爱上了鞍山。他觉得在乡下过日子，和过去比，当然已经好得多了，过去一分地也没有，现在已分到了二十亩地。但他一看见鞍山，他看到了他自己过去梦想不到的地方，他对自己原来的生活就感到不满足了，当他特别知道了在这里所生产出来的钢铁，将为我们祖国制造出数量庞大的铁轨，以及火车、汽车、拖拉机等不可缺少的材料，他就开始念念不忘地很想到这个城市里来做一个工人。
    一九五二年夏天鞍山开始大规模建设的时候，他的愿望终于实现了，他和很多从农村里来的农民一样，在鞍山大型工地得到了当一名混凝土工人的工作。
    李有财开始当工人，什么事儿也觉得新奇。那万能装卸车，一车就能装几千斤洋灰，不但驮着到处跑，而且还能自己卸下来。几万斤重的物件，起重机要吊到那儿，就吊到那儿，像老鹰抓小鸡似的。混凝土工人在“基础”里工作，公家还给发手套，发给新的帆布工作服和长统的胶鞋。说来也带劲，一个月的工资，能买一头挺壮实的小毛驴，这比种地，可真强多了。但是，在李有财的心里，也有蹩扭的地方，譬如，吃饭要排队买票，不如在家里炕头上一坐，老婆就把饭端上来了。有时刮风下雨，也不能蹲在家里，还得来上班。李有财当了工人，他虽然是按照着工人的规矩进行工作，但有时仍不免有些旧东西，还在他的脑子里作怪。
    有一次，下班的时候，李有财的肩上，一前一后，挎着一双买了不久的球鞋，他的脚上拖着那双工作时穿的肥大的长统胶鞋，准备回家去。恰巧刚走上马路，就碰见了支部书记，支部书记看见他这种走路的样子，两只眼睛就很自然地落在他的脚上。他说：“李有财，你怎么把自己的鞋子挎在肩上，穿了公家的胶鞋回家呢？”
    李有财这时候是非常尴尬的，他无法回答支部书记向他提出的问题。
    支部书记毫不留情地接着说：“家里的锅台坏了，门坏了，谁也知道会换一块砖，钉一个洋钉。自己的球鞋穿得偏了一点，也知道到街上去粘个后跟，为什么对公家的胶鞋就不这样爱惜呢？”这些话刚说完，支部书记就急急忙忙被队部的人叫去开会了。而魁梧的李有财却愣在那儿，满脸通红，他坐下来，慢慢地换上了他的新球鞋。
    李有财在混凝土队的这些日子里，他常常听支部书记一说话就是：我们工人阶级应该怎样怎样。他开始听不懂，但日子稍久一些，他就觉得支部书记说的话就不大简单了。本来在乡下自己觉得懂事情不少的李有财，在这里自己有些地方总觉得有些差劲。在那些工程紧张的日子里，他看见那个瘦瘦的支部书记根本就不回家睡觉，他在那个刮风有风，下雨透雨的席棚里，把蓑衣往高低不平的工具上一铺，就算是他黑夜睡觉的地方。有时候，干脆就坐在“基础”旁边，合一合眼。有一次半夜下大雨，支部书记为了洋灰不被雨水浇着，在漆黑的夜里，不管雨水浇得他眼睛也睁不开，他动员大家找木杆，找席子，搭棚。他是个近视眼，还带着眼镜，摔下去，爬起来，他一切都不顾，还爬上那在大风雨里摇摇摆摆的木杆去盖席子。工人们在浇灌洋灰的时候，有一个叫郝金明的，发现有一个地方的木模流出灰浆来，一看没有法子办，唰一下把自己的单衣脱下来，堵住了灰浆，后来领导上表扬了他，他说：“灰浆像人身上血，为了百年大计，不影响质量，这是工人阶级的本分，没有什么可说的。”这些事情给李有财很有刺激，他想，别人为了工作，命也不要似的，什么苦也受得了，自己有时候因为开个会，晚回去一会儿，心里就不痛快。别人为了保证质量，自己的衣服也不管了，自己见了地上的洋钉、铁丝，看也不看，这怎么能像个工人阶级呢？
    工人阶级这四个字，在李有财的身上聚结着它的力量。在十八号“基础”上发生的事情，证明了李有财的确是在迈步前进了。
    十八号“基础”的混凝土工程已经到临近尾声的阶段，下面的底座已经打好，上面是接着打小墙，打好小墙以后，十八号“基础”就可以算完工了。
    李有财这一夜正被分配在这个“基础”上打小墙，他正在紧张捣固的时候，他发现捣固下去的石子，由于缺少灰浆，有些发干，他看了看吊车里送来的洋灰，灰浆是稠一些，但不像“基础”里的洋灰那种样子。他是懂得灰浆少了，剩下石子，就像一个人只有骨头没有血一样，这是会影响工程质量的。这时间，天已经黑了，浅淡的灯光使“基础”里有很多地方陷在黑暗中，他无法知道毛病究竟是在什么地方。
    一会儿，他发现“基础”里的石子好像更干了些，他看了看木模旁边的“基础”，有两公尺多深，里面顶满了木条，人下去后只能侧着身子移动。李有财毫不踌躇地钻了下去，他有时是慢慢地爬着走，有时蜷成一团，一寸一寸地往前爬，“基础”底下，黑糊糊地，什么也看不见，他只好顺着木模板接岔的地方用手去摸。一摸，那木模板底下，高低不平，有的钢筋和混凝土都露在外边，木板下边，流满了稀薄的灰浆。李有财用手伸进木板的底下，灰浆正从这些地方直流下来。根据他这短短的几个月在混凝土队工作的经验，知道灰浆留不住，里头难免发生蜂窝、狗洞。李有财迅速地从“基础”里爬上来，找到了领工员侯宝生，李有财把刚才“基础”底下发生的事情，从头到尾说了一遍。最后，他担心地说：“这儿漏灰，就不能保证质量了，赶快得想办法。”
    但是，那位穿得干干净净的侯宝生的反应是很冷淡的。他说：“这没有什么，不要紧。”
        “这怎么不要紧呢？灰浆都快漏完了。”
    “我说不要紧就不要紧，你知道什么，你赶快去干你的工作。”
    明明有事，领工员却说没有事，这把一个经验不足的混凝土工人弄糊涂了，李有财无可奈何地走回原来捣固的地方。他想：操作规程明明是这样说的，石子要是没有了灰浆，这就不成混凝土了，这怎么会没有事儿呢？
    这时候，李有财的脚虽然还在使劲踩洋灰，手还在捣固，但他的心却是不安定得很。他越想，这个道理越解不开，他没有办法再使自己照常工作下去。
    他又钻到“基础”里去，他的衣服虽然湿了，脸上虽然挂着豆大的汗珠，手指头因为刚才长久地浸在洋灰浆里，都起了白泡，有的地方皮也破了，洋灰粘在鲜红的肉上，一直疼到心里。李有财忍住了痛苦，他爬下去以后，用他的手继续伸入灰浆里，并且咬住牙，靠着木模用力地向上伸进去，他的已经破了的手指头触及坚硬的石头，疼得人都哆嗦，但他不顾一切地向里头掏，终于摸着了那快要凝固的洋灰，真的有狗洞，大的竟有脑袋那么大。他想：我们在上头打洋灰，但下面却是空的，洋灰上面将来要安装大机器，这不是在哄自己吗？
    李有财急忙地又去找到了领工员侯宝生，李有财有些急了，他把一切告诉了侯宝生以后说：“眼瞅这事情坏了，别再在这‘基础’上倒洋灰了。”
    那洋灰搅拌厂送来的洋灰，吊车正在呜呜地一斗一斗运送过来，继续倾泻在“基础”上。
    侯宝生看见李有财这种样子，觉得太大惊小怪，他不耐烦地说：“谁也不像你，叫你干，你就有病。”
        “你去看看就知道了。” “那没有关系，用不着看，你那么怕干什么。你怕，你到另一个地方去干。”
    “为什么没有关系，下头是空的，弄好了，将来还得爆破重做，百年大计就成了一年小计了。我到另外一个地方干，问题也解决不了。”
    侯宝生自知理短，他有些黏糊了，他不得已地跟着李有财到了那个出毛病的地方。接着，李有财又艰难地钻到“基础”下边。在黑暗中，他仰着头对侯宝生说：“你下来看看，你就知道这个毛病多大了。”
    侯宝生站在“基础”的边上，他说：“你想想办法就算了。”
    “我有什么办法，我自己能干就用不着找你了。”
        “你用手塞一塞也可以。”
    “灰浆又不是棉花，你说怎么塞。”李有财大声地说：“你不好下来看看吗？这里又没有挂杀人刀，你为什么不下来。”
    只听见侯宝生在上头咿咿呀呀，不知说些什么。反正他没有下来，也看不到下面的情形。这时候，技术员潘殿松正走到十八号“基础”上来。
    李有财因为和侯宝生争论没有结果，他从“基础”底下又爬上来，正看见潘殿松，他把这件事情讲给潘殿松听，小潘听了以后，马上随着李有财钻到基础底下去。他们从北往南，边摸边走，越往南，窟窿越大。情况是很严重的。
    潘殿松上来以后，已快到半夜了，他立刻打了个电话给工地总工程师。总工程师已经睡觉了，他听了这个报告，马上就到了现场，让木工拆开木板，用电筒一照，果然是一个一个大窟窿，有的地方甚至是空的，有的地方用脚一踩，石子就酥酥地掉下来。
    这时候，已经没有别的办法可以补救了，只有集中更多的混凝土工人，把已经灌上的洋灰，全部打掉。李有财忘记了他的手指头上皮破血流的痛苦，他不声不响，他在这个“基础”的小墙返工工程中，仍然是最积极的一个。
    只有侯宝生一个人，他僵硬地站在“基础”上，动也不动，一直好像在发呆，嘴里喃喃地说：“这怎么会是真的？这怎么会是真的？”（附图片）
