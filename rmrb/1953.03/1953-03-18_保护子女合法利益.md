    Protecting the Legitimate Interests of Children
    Tian Xiujuan, Chairman of the Women's Work Committee of the North China Region
    Article 1 of Chapter 1 of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "A new democratic marriage system is implemented, featuring freedom of marriage for both men and women, monogamy, equal rights for men and women, and protection of the legitimate interests of women and children." This clearly points out one of the characteristics of the new democratic marriage system, which is the protection of the legitimate interests of children.
    In feudal society, children were a kind of private property of the head of the family. Parents could arbitrarily dispose of, abandon, and abuse children, demanding absolute obedience from them. It was said that "the sovereign can demand the minister's death, and the father can demand the son's death." This meant that parents could even harm their children's lives at will. Even in working people's families, it was often seen that husbands, subjected to oppression and exploitation outside, would come home and beat their wives and children; wives, suffering from exploitation, oppression, and their husbands' beatings and scolding, would vent their anger on the children. In this way, children became the most miserable people in a painful family. Under the feudal marriage system, many underage young girls were sold to families as child brides or married off at the age of thirteen or fourteen, bearing heavy labor and enduring beatings and abuse all day long. The minds and bodies of these children were devastated, their intelligence was stifled, and some even lost their lives.
    In New China, in the new democratic society, the democratic rights of the people are protected. Children are not only members of the family but also members of society, the little masters of the new society and the new country. They will shoulder the task of building socialism and communism in the future, so it is necessary to ensure their healthy mental and physical development in all aspects. In the three years since the founding of our New China, the status of children has been greatly improved. There are special facilities and institutions serving children in education, childcare, medical and health services, and other fields. However, the old marriage system and family system still widely exist in many areas, and many parents still have feudal remnants of thought, treating their children as private property to be disposed of at will. Therefore, in many areas, the legitimate interests of children have not been effectively guaranteed and are often harmed.
    While stipulating the abolition of the old marriage system and the establishment of a new marriage system, the Marriage Law also stipulates that raising children is an obligation that both husband and wife should jointly undertake (see Article 8 of Chapter 3). Chapter 4 of the Marriage Law also makes special provisions regarding the "relationship between parents and children." This chapter is permeated with the spirit of protecting the legitimate interests of children. Article 13 contains three provisions: The first provision states that parents have the obligation to raise and educate their children, and are not allowed to abuse or abandon them; children also have the obligation to support and assist their parents, and are not allowed to abuse their parents or disregard their lives. The second provision stipulates that the relationship between adoptive parents and adopted children is the same as that between biological parents and biological children, and both parties have the obligation to support each other and are not allowed to abuse or abandon each other. The third provision stipulates that all barbaric and brutal acts of harming the lives of newborn babies are criminal acts and must be strictly prohibited. Some people, because of their patriarchal ideas and the belief that daughters are a waste of money, kill female babies as soon as they are born; others, because they are pregnant with children through adultery and fear being known, try to have abortions, or throw away or kill the children as soon as they are born. These acts of harming the lives of newborn babies, like acts of abusing children, are illegal. Children born out of wedlock, also known as "illegitimate children" in the old society, are the result of the old marriage system characterized by lack of freedom of marriage and inequality between men and women. These children were most despised in the old society, and their rights were not guaranteed at all. However, these children are also the offspring of society and the little masters of the country, so the people's democratic state and the new democratic society protect them equally. Article 15 of the Marriage Law stipulates that children born out of wedlock enjoy the same rights as ordinary children, and no one is allowed to harm them or treat them differently. In order to ensure that children born out of wedlock receive the guarantee of life and education, this article also stipulates that if such children, through their biological mother or through testimonial and physical evidence, prove who their biological father is, then their biological father shall bear all or part of the necessary living expenses and education expenses until the child reaches the age of eighteen. If the biological mother agrees, the biological father can also take the child back to raise.
    Article 16 of the Marriage Law also stipulates that stepmothers must not abuse or treat differently the children born by their husband's previous wife, and husbands must not abuse or treat differently the children brought by their wives.
    The above provisions illustrate the spirit of the new marriage system to comprehensively protect the legitimate interests of children, pointing out that parents, whether towards children born in wedlock, adopted children, children born out of wedlock, or children from their husband's or wife's previous marriage, must bear the responsibility of raising and educating them. Under various parental relationships, their human rights and their status in the family and society shall be protected by national law.
    Article 18 of the Marriage Law stipulates that the husband is not allowed to file for divorce when the wife is pregnant, and must wait until one year after the wife has given birth. The wife is not subject to this restriction if she files for divorce. This is because women are already heavily burdened mentally and physically when they are pregnant or have just given birth, and the developing fetus or the newly born child is developing. If the husband files for divorce at this time, causing the wife to be too mentally stimulated, it will be very harmful to both the adult and the child. As for the wife filing for divorce during pregnancy or within one year after giving birth, it is mostly because it is really a last resort, and it is better to divorce than not to divorce. In order to protect the mother and the development of the fetus or the child, this time limit need not apply.
    Divorce of parents is undoubtedly a major event for young children. In the old society, the upbringing and education of children often lost their guarantee because of the divorce of parents. In view of this situation, Article 17 of the Marriage Law stipulates that when allowing both men and women to divorce, it is also necessary to investigate and clarify that both parties to the divorce have indeed properly handled the issues of children and property before issuing a divorce certificate.
    Chapter 6 of the Marriage Law stipulates the methods for raising and educating children after the divorce of parents, which is closely related to the protection of the interests of children.
    Article 20 stipulates that the blood relationship between parents and children does not disappear after the divorce of parents. In this way, children will not fall into the tragic situation of having a father without a mother or a mother without a father because of the divorce of their parents. This provision is made because the relationship between parents and children is not like the relationship between husband and wife; the relationship between husband and wife is a voluntary union, and this relationship disappears when one party dies or both parties divorce. However, the relationship between parents and children is a blood relationship and cannot disappear because of the divorce of parents. After the divorce of parents, children are still the children of both parents, regardless of whether they are raised by the father or the mother. Therefore, this article also stipulates that both parents still have the responsibility to raise and educate their children after divorce. Regardless of which party is directly responsible for raising and educating the children, the other party still has a responsibility towards the children. In the old society, children must be left to the man after the divorce of parents, and the mother was not allowed to see the children, which caused great pain to the mother and the children. Now, children are still the children of both parties after the divorce of parents, so who should be responsible for directly raising and educating them can be resolved through joint consultation between the two parties to the divorce. If there is a dispute, the people's court shall, based on the interests of the children, determine who is better for the children to be directly raised and educated by, and shall order that the children be directly raised and educated by that person. Article 21 of the Marriage Law stipulates that after the divorce of parents, the father should bear all or part of the necessary living expenses and education expenses for children who live with their mother. This is because the economic status of women is generally worse than that of men. If the woman takes the child away and the man does not bear the cost of raising and educating the child, then the woman is likely to be afraid to file for divorce because of this. Even if they divorce, they will have to heartlessly abandon the child. In this way, both the mother and the child will feel great pain. Of course, if the property divided between the woman and the children is sufficient to maintain the children's living expenses and education expenses, the man can also no longer bear the expenses; or if the woman remarries and the new husband is willing to bear all or part of the living expenses and education expenses of the woman's original children, then the burden on the child's biological father can also be reduced or waived depending on the circumstances. Articles 22 and 23 of the Marriage Law have made clear provisions on this. In addition, Article 23 also mentions the principle of handling family property when both men and women divorce, which is to take care of the interests of women and children and to be beneficial to production.
    The Marriage Law attaches importance to protecting the legitimate interests of children. However, many of our cadres, because of their feudal remnants of thought that look down on women and disregard the interests of children, are unable to fully and deeply understand the spirit of the Marriage Law and stand up for women and children who are oppressed and abused. Now, we must clearly recognize the importance of protecting future generations for the country and society, take responsibility for protecting the interests of children, cultivate new forces, and establish a new moral concept of loving the country, loving family members, and loving children among the masses.

Correction: In the article "Experiences Gained from the 'Comparative' Test of Lightning Arresters" published on page 3 of this newspaper on February 22, the "drawings" in the fourth line of the second paragraph should be "actual samples"; "two thirty 'kilovolts'" in the tenth line of the third paragraph should be changed to "two twenty 'kilovolts' and one fifteen 'kilovolts'"; "thirty 'kilovolts'" in the fourth line of the second-to-last paragraph should be "three 'kilovolts'."

Also: In the article "Amateur Cultural Education for Cadres in Tangshan City" published on page 3 of this newspaper on February 18, "404 students" in the seventh line of the third paragraph should be "401 students."

### 保护子女合法利益

专栏：

    保护子女合法利益
    华北区妇女工作委员会主席　田秀娟
    中华人民共和国婚姻法第一章第一条规定：“实行男女婚姻自由、一夫一妻、男女权利平等、保护妇女和子女合法利益的新民主主义婚姻制度”。这里明确地指出了新民主主义婚姻制度的特点之一，是保护子女合法利益。
    在封建社会里，子女是家长的一种私有财产。家长可以任意处置和遗弃蹂躏子女，要子女绝对服从家长，所谓“君要臣死，不得不死；父要子亡，不得不亡”。就是说，家长还可以随意伤害子女的生命。就在劳动人民的家庭里也常常可以看到：丈夫在外面受到压迫剥削，回家就打老婆，打孩子；妻子受了剥削压迫和丈夫的打骂，也在孩子身上出气。这样，孩子就成了痛苦家庭里最痛苦的人。在封建婚姻制度下，还有很多没有成年的小女孩子就被卖给人家做童养媳，或是十三、四岁就嫁出去了，担负着沉重的劳动，还要整天挨打受气。这些孩子的精神和肉体都受着摧残，她们的聪明智慧被扼杀了，有的连生命也被毁掉了。
    在新中国，在新民主主义社会里，人民的民主权利得到了保护。子女不光是家庭的一分子，而且是社会的一分子，新社会新国家的小主人，他们要在将来担负建设社会主义和共产主义的任务，因此就必须从各方面来保证子女的精神和身体的健康发展。我们新中国建立三年多以来，儿童的地位已经大大提高，在教育、保育、医药卫生等事业方面，都有专门为儿童服务的设施和机构。但是，旧的婚姻制度和家庭制度还在广大地区普遍存在，很多家长还有封建残余思想，他们仍然把子女当成私有的东西随便处置，因此在许多地区子女的合法利益还没有得到确实的保障，还经常受到损害。
    婚姻法在规定废除旧婚姻制度，建立新婚姻制度的同时，把抚育子女规定做夫妻之间应当共同担负的一项义务（见第三章第八条）。婚姻法第四章并专门做了关于“父母子女间的关系”的规定。这一章贯串了保护子女合法利益的精神。在第十三条里有三款规定：第一款是说做父母的对于子女有抚养和教育的义务，不许虐待子女或者丢掉子女不管；子女对于父母也有赡养扶助的义务，不许虐待父母或者不顾父母的生活。第二款规定了养父母跟养子女相互间的关系，也像亲生父母跟亲生子女间的关系一样，双方都有互相扶养的义务，都不许虐待或者抛弃不管。第三款规定：凡是残害初生下的小孩生命的野蛮残暴行为，都是犯罪的行为，都要严厉地禁止。有些人因为有重男轻女的思想，认为女儿是赔钱货，一生下女孩子就给弄死；还有些人因通奸怀了小孩，怕人知道，就想法打胎，或者孩子一生下来就扔了，或是掏死。这些残害初生小孩生命的行为，跟虐杀子女的行为一样，都是犯法的。非婚生子女，也就是旧社会所说的“私生子女”这是婚姻不自由、男女不平等的旧婚姻制度的结果。这些孩子在旧社会最被人瞧不起，他们的权利没有一点保障。但是，这些子女也是社会的后代，国家的小主人，所以人民民主的国家和新民主主义的社会也同样地保护他们。婚姻法第十五条规定：非婚生子女和一般子女享受同等的权利，谁也不准伤害他们，不准对他们两样看待。为了使非婚生子女得到生活和教育的保障，这一条里还规定：如果这种孩子经他的生母，或者经人证、物证，证明谁是他的生父的时候，那末他的生父就要负担他必要的生活费和教育费的全部或是一部分，直到孩子满十八岁为止。要是生母同意，生父也可以把孩子领回去抚养。
    婚姻法第十六条还规定：后母对前房生的子女，丈夫对妻子带来的孩子，都不能虐待或是两样看待。
    以上这些规定，说明了新婚姻制度全面地保护子女合法利益的精神，指出了父母不论是对婚生子女、养子女、非婚生子女和对丈夫或妻子以前的子女，都要担负抚养教育的责任。子女在种种不同的父母关系之下，他们的人权以及在家庭和社会上的地位，都要受到国家法律的保护。
    婚姻法第十八条规定：在女方怀孕的时候，男方不准提出离婚，必须要等女方生孩子满一年以后才可以提出。女方提出离婚，则不受这种限制。这是因为妇女怀孩子的时候或者刚生孩子以后，精神上肉体上本来已经负担很重，怀着的胎儿或者刚生的小孩正在发育，如果男方这时候提出离婚，使女方精神上受刺激太大，对大人和孩子都有很大的害处。至于女方在怀孩子的时候或是生孩子后一年内提出离婚，大都是因为实在不得已，离了比不离好，才提出的。为了保护母亲和胎儿或是小孩的发育，因此可以不必受这种时间的限制。
    父母离婚，对于年纪小的子女，不能不说是一个重大的事变。在旧社会，往往因为父母离婚，子女的抚养教育就失去保障。针对这种情况，婚姻法第十七条规定，在准许男女双方离婚的时候，也还要调查明白离婚双方对子女和财产问题确实有适当处理以后，才发给离婚证。
    婚姻法第六章规定了父母离婚以后抚养和教育子女的办法，对保护子女利益有很密切的关系。
    在第二十条里面规定，父母离婚以后父母跟子女之间的血亲关系并不消灭。这样就不会因为父母离婚而使子女落到有父无母或有母无父的悲惨境地。这样规定是因为父母跟子女之间的关系，不是像夫妻之间的关系那样；夫妻间的关系是双方自愿结合的，这种关系在一方死亡或是双方离婚的时候就消灭了。但是父母跟子女之间的关系是血亲关系，不能因为父母离婚而消灭。父母离婚以后，子女不论由父亲或是母亲抚养，也还是原来的父母双方的子女。因此在这一条里又规定了离婚以后父母双方对子女仍然有抚养教育的责任。不管归那一方直接负责抚养教育，另一方对子女都仍然有责任。在旧社会，父母离婚以后，子女一定要留给男方，而且不准母亲去看孩子，这给母亲和孩子造成很大的痛苦。现在，父母离婚以后子女还是双方的子女，所以由谁来担负直接抚养教育的责任，就可以由离婚双方共同商议解决。争持不下时，由人民法院根据子女的利益，看孩子归谁直接抚养教育对孩子更好，就判给谁直接抚养教育。婚姻法第二十一条规定，父母离婚以后，跟着母亲过活的孩子，父亲应该负担必要的生活费和教育费的全部或一部分。这是因为妇女的经济地位一般地比男子要差。如果女方把小孩带走，男方就不负担抚养教育的费用了，那么女方就很可能因此不敢提出离婚。即使离婚，也只好忍心抛下孩子。这样，母亲和孩子都会感到很大痛苦。当然，如果女方和子女分得的财产足够维持子女的生活费和教育费，男方也可以不再负担；或者女方再结婚以后，新的丈夫愿意负担女方原来所生的子女的全部或是一部分生活费和教育费，那末子女的生父的负担也就可以酌量情形减少或是免除。这在婚姻法第二十二条、第二十三条，都作了明确的规定。另外，第二十三条还提到男女双方离婚时处理家庭财产的原则，也是要照顾女方和子女的利益，并且要对生产有利。
    婚姻法是重视保护子女合法利益的。可是我们还有很多干部，因为有瞧不起妇女和漠视子女利益的封建残余思想，所以不能够全面地深刻地领会婚姻法的精神，为受压迫受虐待的妇女和孩子们撑腰。现在，我们一定要明确认识保护后代对于国家和社会的重要，负起责任来保护子女的利益，培植新生的力量，在群众中树立起爱护国家，爱护家庭成员，爱护子女的新道德观念。更正本报二月二十二日三版所载“从避雷器的‘比较’试验中得到的体会”一文的第二段第四行中的“图样”应为“实样”；第三段第十行中的“两个三十‘仟伏’”应改为“两个二十‘仟伏’和一个十五‘仟伏’”；倒数第二段第四行中的“三十‘仟伏’”应为“三‘仟伏’”。
    又：本报二月十八日三版所载“唐山市的干部业余文化教育”一文的第三段第七行中“学员四○四人”应为“学员四○一人”。
