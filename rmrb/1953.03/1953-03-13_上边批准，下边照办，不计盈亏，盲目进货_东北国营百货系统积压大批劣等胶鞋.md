Northeast State-Owned Department Store System Accumulates a Large Stockpile of Inferior Rubber Shoes
The state-owned department store trading system in the Northeast region has accumulated a large stockpile of inferior rubber shoes. Among them, the Qing sports shoes, water socks, and long five-eye shoes alone amount to six million pairs. The stockpile of Qing sports shoes is enough for two years of sales. Most of these rubber shoes are substandard goods that fall apart and the soles come off after being worn for less than half a month. They were all ordered by the Northeast District Department Store Company from factories under the former Northeast Industrial Department. When ordering began in the first quarter of 1952, it was already clear that the production of rubber shoes exceeded consumer demand. At that time, the Northeast District Department Store Company inquired of the former Northeast People's Economic Planning Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Northeast Planning Committee): "What if the rubber shoes are overstocked? What if we lose money?" But they did not propose a solution themselves. At the production-sales balance ordering conference held by the Northeast Planning Committee in May, the Northeast District Department Store Company still raised this point. Wang Yanqun, Director of the Trade and Cooperation Division of the Northeast Planning Committee, said at the meeting: Overstocking will be counted outside of turnover, and you are approved to use this credit; losses will also be borne by the commercial department and deducted from profits. After this meeting, the Northeast Planning Committee issued an instruction, repeating the decision of the balance meeting. The Northeast District Department Store Company thus mistakenly believed that this solved the problem of overstocking and losses. They felt that there was no reason not to order, and they should "follow the instructions of the higher authorities and order them in."

In this way, large quantities of rubber shoes were stockpiled in the warehouses of state-owned department stores throughout the region. Because the purchase price was higher than the sales price, the rubber shoes that were sold also caused losses to the state. Taking the first quarter's purchasing and sales situation as an example: the purchase price of Qing sports shoes was 37,000 yuan per pair, but the list price was only 30,000 yuan, resulting in a loss of 7,000 yuan per pair after deducting commercial circulation costs. In the first quarter of last year, the Northeast District Department Store Company lost about 27.5 billion yuan on Qing sports shoes, water socks, and long five-eye shoes alone.

This situation led the rubber shoe factories under the former Northeast Industrial Department to mistakenly believe that the sales problem had been solved, and they paid even less attention to improvements in production. They could have produced new, high-quality rubber shoes, but they simply pursued production quantity. The Northeast District Department Store Company also did not actively offer them suggestions for improving production. Therefore, in the second and third quarters of last year, they produced a large number of shoddy, substandard rubber shoes. They did not produce according to the national quality standards, one-sidedly emphasizing saving raw materials, and even reducing operating procedures, resulting in rubber shoes that were extremely prone to come unglued and have their soles fall off.

After the Northeast District Department Store Company finalized the rubber shoe contract, it distributed the orders to the local department store wholesale stations. The wholesale stations followed the contract and completed the delivery procedures without checking the quality of the rubber shoes at all. This batch of rubber shoes was transported from the factory to the wholesale station warehouse, and then from the wholesale station to the city and county department stores, and placed on the shelves of the retail departments and stores. The rubber shoes were sold to peasants and workers, but they fell apart within ten days or half a month. Consumers often brought these substandard rubber shoes to state-owned stores or cooperatives for returns. This problem was not reflected to the Northeast District Department Store Company until the fourth quarter of 1952. However, by this time, the overstocking and sluggish sales of rubber shoes had become very serious.

The Northeast District Department Store Company has a serious supply-system management mentality and style. They adopted the erroneous practices of "higher-ups approve, lower-downs follow suit" and "not asking about profits or losses, not caring about overstocking." Some people believe: "Since losses and overstocking are approved by someone, we can order the goods." Wholesale stations and city and county department stores also inherited this practice, receiving goods without distinction of specifications, without regard for quality, and without any objections. This has caused serious losses to the state due to overstocked goods and financial losses, and has fueled the blindness of industrial production. The industrial departments lack a comprehensive concept of fulfilling the national plan and, without regard to market needs, one-sidedly pursue quantity and "saving" raw materials, which is also wrong. The former Northeast People's Economic Planning Committee lacked a serious attitude towards in-depth investigation and research, blindly developing production and one-sidedly favoring industry. In essence, it condoned the industrial departments' practice of simply pursuing quantity and neglecting product quality, resulting in losses for both industry and commerce. The Northeast District State-Owned Department Store System stopped ordering Northeast rubber shoes in the fourth quarter of last year due to the excessive overstocking of rubber shoes.

This phenomenon is widespread in the Northeast District State-Owned Department Store System. Commodities such as burlap bags and vulcanized blue cloth are also heavily overstocked due to the above reasons. The above-mentioned units must learn from these facts, conscientiously investigate consumer needs, and correctly balance production and sales. The existing substandard rubber shoes should be seriously dealt with, and the reasons should be explained to consumers in order to restore the losses caused by state-owned commerce and industry among the masses.

### 上边批准，下边照办，不计盈亏，盲目进货  东北国营百货系统积压大批劣等胶鞋

    上边批准，下边照办，不计盈亏，盲目进货
    东北国营百货系统积压大批劣等胶鞋
    东北区国营百货贸易系统积压了大批劣等胶鞋。其中仅青运动鞋、水袜子、长五眼鞋三种就有六百万双。积压的青运动鞋足够两年销售。这些胶鞋大部分是穿不了半个月就开胶断底的次货，都是东北区百货公司从原东北工业部所属各厂订购的。在一九五二年第一季度开始订货的时候，胶鞋生产量超过消费需要的情况就很明显了。当时东北区百货公司曾请示原东北人民经济计划委员会（以下简称东北计委会）：“胶鞋积压了怎么办？赔了钱怎么办？”但自己并没有提出解决的办法。在五月份东北计委会召开的产销平衡订货会议上，东北区百货公司仍然提出了这个意见。东北计委会贸易合作处王燕群处长在会议上说：积压算在周转之外，批准你们占用这笔信贷；赔钱也由商业部门来赔，在利润里面扣除。这次会后，东北计委会发了一个指示，重复平衡会议上的决定。东北区百货公司于是错误地认为：这就算把积压和赔钱的问题解决了。他们认为，再没有不订货的理由了，应该“按照上级指示办事，订进来”。
    这样，大量胶鞋就被积压在各地国营百货公司的仓库里了。由于进货价高于销售牌价，已经销出的胶鞋同样使国家受到损失。以一季度的进销情况为例：青运动鞋每双进货价为三万七千元，牌价却仅为三万元，除去商业流转费用每双还赔七千元。去年第一季度，东北区百货公司仅青运动鞋、水袜子、长五眼鞋三种就赔了二百七十五亿元左右。
    这种情况，使原东北工业部所属各胶鞋厂错误地认为产品销路问题已经解决，更加不注意生产上的改进了。本来他们可以生产新的、质量好的胶鞋，但是他们却单纯追求生产数量。东北区百货公司也没有积极对他们提出改进生产的意见，因此，去年二、三季度中，他们就大量地生产了粗制滥造的次胶鞋。他们不按着国家规定的质量标准生产，片面地强调节省原料，甚至减少操作过程，以致生产出来的胶鞋极易开胶断底。
    东北区百货公司订妥了胶鞋合同之后，又将订货分配给各地百货批发站。各批发站按着合同照办提货手续，根本没有检查胶鞋质量。这批胶鞋就由工厂运到批发站仓库，又由批发站拨到市县百货公司，摆到门市部和商店的货架上。胶鞋卖到了农民、职工手里，不过十天半月就开胶断底了。消费者常常拿着这种次胶鞋到国营商店或合作社退货。这个问题直到一九五二年第四季度，才反映到东北区百货公司。但是，这时候胶鞋的积压和滞销已经十分严重了。
    东北区百货公司存在着严重的供给制经营思想和作风。他们采取了“上边批准，下边照办”，“不问赔赚、不管积压”的错误作法。有些人认为：“赔钱、积压都有人批准，就可以进货。”批发站和市县百货公司也承袭了这种作法，不分规格、不问质量、毫无意见地把货接收进来。这就给国家造成了积压商品和赔钱的严重损失，并助长了工业生产的盲目性。工业部门缺乏全面完成国家计划的观念，不问市场需要，片面地追求数量和“节约”原料，也是错误的。原东北人民经济计划委员会缺乏深入调查、研究问题的严肃态度，盲目地发展生产，片面地照顾工业，实质上是纵容了工业部门单纯追求数量忽视产品质量的作法，结果使工业和商业都受到损失。东北区国营百货系统因为胶鞋积压过大，在去年第四季度就停止了东北胶鞋的进货。
    这种现象在东北区国营百货系统中普遍地存在着。如麻袋、硫化青等，都是由于上述原因，大量积压下来。上述各单位必须从这种事实中取得经验教训，认真地调查消费者的需要，正确地平衡产销。对于现存的次胶鞋应该严肃处理，并向消费者讲明道理，以挽回国营商业和工业在群众中造成的损失。
