Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The people of all countries in the world mourn the passing of the great leader and teacher of progressive humanity, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, with boundless grief and steadfast hearts.

	Korean People's Leader Kim Il-sung Writes Memorial Article

The Korean Central News Agency published on the 9th an article written by the Korean people's leader Kim Il-sung in memory of Comrade Stalin, entitled "Stalin is the Inspirer of the Struggle of the People Defending Their Freedom and Independence." Kim Il-sung wrote: Stalin is dead. The ardent heart of the great leader of progressive humanity has stopped beating. This sad news spread like lightning throughout all regions of Korea, striking the hearts of millions of people like a thunderbolt.

Kim Il-sung said: Everything most noble and beautiful in the lives of the Korean people is linked to the name of Stalin. In the early days of the liberation movement against the dark rule of the Japanese samurai in Korea, our young revolutionaries eagerly studied Stalin's genius writings on the liberation struggle of the Asian people. Stalin's writings on the Eastern Revolution are programmatic documents for the people of Eastern countries and the Korean people.

Kim Il-sung added: The victory of the Soviet Union in World War II freed China and the People's Democratic countries of Europe from the capitalist system forever. The great Soviet army, led by the genius commander Marshal Stalin, drove the bloodsucking Japanese samurai from our land and liberated the Korean people. The Soviet army created favorable conditions for the Korean people to establish a democratic country according to their own will during the years 1945-1948.

Kim Il-sung then pointed out: The Korean Workers' Party, based on the experience of the Soviet Union and the genius theories of Lenin and Stalin, promptly created the People's Army. The People's Army, fighting according to the laws of the world's most advanced Stalinist military science, defeated the offensive of the American army. In our selfless and courageous struggle, our people have received support and solidarity from the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries in all aspects. The liberated great Chinese people sent their People's Volunteers. This assistance has become a great model of the Stalinist friendship between the people of the countries of the powerful democratic camp in the world. Eight hundred million free people armed with the progressive ideas of mankind created by Lenin and Stalin are an invincible force for peace. With such power, peace will surely triumph over war.

Kim Il-sung pointed out: The eyes of the people of the world are now focused on Korea, that is, on the heroic sons and daughters of Korea. The Korean people must win. This means that the flames of war that attempt to burn the neighboring countries of Korea and sweep the globe will be extinguished. The Korean people cannot but win. Because, in front of them, there is the long-tested Workers' Party, it is a Leninist-Stalinist party, which bases its entire activities on the genius teachings of Lenin and Stalin, and utilizes the experience of the advanced fraternal parties.

Kim Il-sung finally emphasized: We, the Korean people, swear before the spirit of the leader of the working people of the world that we will be faithful to his will and will further strengthen proletarian internationalism in the struggle for human happiness. The brave Korean people are advancing, holding high the great and ever-victorious banner of Stalin.

	Hungarian Working People's Party General Secretary Rákosi Writes Memorial Article

The Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article by Mátyás Rákosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, entitled "The Victorious Stalin—Banner of Proletarian Internationalism". Rákosi wrote: The example of the Soviet Communists educated by Stalin convinces us that as long as we steadfastly defend the cause of the working people of our country, as long as we constantly achieve victories in the struggle against the enemies of the working people of our country, we will well promote the cause of proletarian internationalism and the cause of human progress.

Rákosi pointed out: The enemies of socialism hope that the death of Comrade Stalin will divide all progressive humanity. But the enemy does not know that this universal and sincere mourning, deep grief, and expression of sympathy of hundreds of millions of outstanding men and women is a powerful demonstration of unity, which generates a new force to unite the working people of the world more closely around the Soviet Union.

Rákosi then said: For hundreds of years, the Hungarian people have waged fierce struggles for freedom and independence. They were able to breathe the air of freedom for the first time in history by relying on the help of the Soviet Union and the great Stalin. The Hungarian working people will always remember that every achievement of ours is inseparable from the help of the liberator, the Soviet Union, and the help of the great Stalin. Gratitude and common ideals connect us with the Soviet Union. Now, our common grief has further strengthened these connections. The working people of our country have all sworn to unite more closely around their Working People's Party and to build their socialist future more selflessly. They guarantee to continuously strengthen the inseparable connection between our country and the great Soviet Union and to be heroic fighters of the powerful world peace front. They swear to struggle even harder for the victory of Stalin's proletarian internationalist ideas.

	World Federation of Trade Unions President Vittorio Writes Memorial Article

The Soviet "Labor News" published an article by Vittorio, General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor and President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, entitled "Stalin and the International Labor Movement". Vittorio said: The death of Comrade Stalin is an irreparable loss to the international working class. But Stalin's cause will surely last forever, and his genius writings and instructions will forever live in the broadest masses of working people and have an ever-increasing impact. The great loss we have encountered requires us to further develop and strengthen unity in the ranks of workers and the masses of people, and to fight for trade union rights and democratic rights, for national independence and world peace. Reactionaries and warmongers will soon see that the infinite grief felt by the working people of all countries because of Stalin's death will become a source of amazing vitality. This vitality will further strengthen the trust of the working people of the world in Lenin and Stalin's great Communist Party, consolidate the unity of the working people of all countries with the great, invincible Soviet Union, and make the world's movement for peace, freedom, and human progress more active, stronger, and invincible.

	World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant Issues Letter to Workers of the World

Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, issued a letter to the workers of the world, saying: "Every worker feels a personal grief at the death of the great Stalin, and the people of the whole world feel that the death of the great Stalin is an irreparable loss. Comrade Stalin, who, together with Lenin, created the world's first multi-ethnic socialist country, confirmed to the workers of the world that it is possible for the people of the world to establish a life of shared equality and to completely abolish all forms of discrimination. Comrade Stalin inspired the irresistible will of the people of the world to strive for national independence, democracy, and freedom, and the decisive force of the people of the world is the working class. The World Federation of Trade Unions and the workers of the world likewise feel infinite grief, and respectfully extend our sincere condolences to the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, to the Soviet people, and to the Soviet government, which is closely linked and inseparable from them. Comrade Stalin was the standard-bearer of working-class internationalism. The World Federation of Trade Unions, faithful to the spirit of working-class internationalism, calls on the workers of the world to unite closely and further strengthen the fraternal ties and close solidarity with those countries where the workers have become masters of their own destiny, these countries being the unshakable fortress of the peace and democracy camp. At the same time, the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on the workers of the world: to make this fraternal unity more dynamic, so as to ensure the victory of the great and invincible ideals of progress, freedom, happiness, peace, and abundant life to which Joseph V. Stalin devoted his life."

	International Democratic Women's Federation Issues Letter to Women of the World

The International Democratic Women's Federation issued a letter to the women of the world, saying:

	"Stalin declared that man is the most precious asset, and he focused the government's attention on the care of children. In this way, he made the most cherished wishes of women come true, because there is nothing more precious to a mother than her child. Stalin was a steel fighter for the great cause of peace, and he will be thanked by generations of women and mothers.

	The cause to which Joseph V. Stalin devoted his life will last forever.

	The International Democratic Women's Federation expressed the extreme grief of women and mothers, and called on women all over the world to strengthen their friendly ties with the women of the Soviet Union, the fortress of peace and democracy, to redouble their efforts and do their best to defend freedom, democracy, and peace, and to build a peaceful environment together with their people, so that progress and science can promote the prosperity of the people of the world.

	Stalin will live forever in the hearts of women all over the world."

    全世界人民哀悼伟大导师斯大林
    据新华社讯：世界各国人民以无限悲痛和坚定的心情哀悼全世界进步人类的伟大领袖和导师约·维·斯大林的逝世。
      朝鲜人民领袖金日成撰文悼念
    朝鲜中央通讯社在九日发表了朝鲜人民领袖金日成为悼念斯大林同志而写的一篇文章，题目是“斯大林是捍卫自己的自由和独立的人民的斗争的鼓舞者”。金日成写道：斯大林逝世了。进步人类的伟大领袖的热烈的心脏停止了跳动。这个悲哀的消息像闪电似地传遍了朝鲜的所有地区，使数百万人民的心中受到了像雷击一样的打击。
    金日成说：在朝鲜人民生活里的最高贵而美好的一切，都是和斯大林的名字相联结的。在朝鲜反对日本武士黑暗统治的解放运动的初期，我们年青的革命家就热心地研究了斯大林关于亚洲人民的解放斗争的天才著作。斯大林关于东方革命的著作，是东方各国人民和朝鲜人民的纲领性的文献。
    金日成又说：苏联在第二次世界大战中的胜利，使中国和欧洲各人民民主国家从资本主义体系中永远摆脱出来。天才的统帅斯大林大元帅领导的伟大的苏联军队，从我们的国土上驱逐了吸血的日本武士们，解放了朝鲜人民。苏联军队在一九四五年—一九四八年间，给朝鲜人民造成了可能按照自己的意志建立民主主义国家的有利条件。
    金日成接着指出：朝鲜劳动党根据苏联的经验和列宁与斯大林的天才理论，及时地创建了人民军。遵循着世界上最先进的斯大林的军事科学的法则而战斗的人民军击败了美国军队的进攻。我们人民在自己忘我、勇敢的斗争中，得到苏联、中华人民共和国及其他人民民主国家的人民的各方面的支持和声援。解放了的伟大的中国人民给我们派遣了自己的人民志愿军。这个援助已成为全世界强有力的民主阵营国家人民之间的斯大林式的友谊的伟大模范。以列宁和斯大林所创造的人类的进步思想武装的八万万自由的人民，是不可战胜的和平力量。有了这样的力量，和平必将战胜战争。
    金日成指出：全世界人民的视线，现在都集中在朝鲜，即朝鲜英雄的儿女们的身上。朝鲜人民一定要胜利。这就意味着，企图燃烧朝鲜的邻邦并席卷全球的战争火焰必将被扑灭。朝鲜人民不能不胜利。因为，在他们的前头，有着久经锻炼的劳动党，它是列宁、斯大林式的党，它在自己的全部活动中，以人类的天才列宁、斯大林的学说为基础，并利用了先进的各兄弟党的经验。
    金日成最后强调说：我们朝鲜人民在世界劳动人民的领袖的灵前宣誓，我们一定忠实于他的遗嘱，一定要在为人类幸福的斗争中进一步加强无产阶级的国际主义。勇敢的朝鲜人民紧紧地举着伟大的斯大林的百战百胜的旗帜前进。
      匈劳动人民党总书记拉科西撰文悼念
    苏联真理报刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党总书记马加斯·拉科西的题为“胜利的斯大林无产阶级国际主义的旗帜”的一篇文章。拉科西写道：斯大林所教养的苏联共产党人的榜样，使我们深信：只要我们坚持不渝地保卫本国劳动人民的事业，只要我们在反对本国劳动人民的敌人的斗争中不断地取得胜利，我们就会很好地促进无产阶级国际主义的事业和人类进步的事业。
    拉科西指出：社会主义的敌人指望斯大林同志的逝世会使全体进步人类陷于分裂。但是，敌人不知道：亿万优秀男女的这种普遍的真诚的哀悼、深切的悲痛和同情的表现，就是团结一致的强大的示威，它产生了一种新的力量，使全世界劳动人民更紧密地团结在苏联的周围。
    拉科西接着说：几百年来，匈牙利人民为自由与独立进行激烈的斗争。他们依靠苏联和伟大的斯大林的帮助，才能在历史上第一次呼吸到自由的空气。匈牙利劳动人民永远记得我们的每一个成就都是和解放者苏联的帮助、和伟大的斯大林的帮助分不开的。感激之情和共同的理想把我们和苏联联系起来。现在，我们共同的悲痛又把这些联系进一步加强了。我国劳动人民都宣誓要更紧密地团结在他们的劳动人民党的周围，要更加忘我地建设他们的社会主义的未来。他们保证要不断加强我国和伟大的苏联之间的不可分的联系，要做强大的世界和平阵线的英勇的战士。他们宣誓要更加努力地为斯大林无产阶级国际主义思想的胜利而斗争。
      世界工联主席维多里奥撰文悼念
    苏联“劳动报”登载意大利总工会总书记、世界工会联合会主席维多里奥的文章，题为“斯大林和国际劳工运动”。维多里奥说：斯大林同志的逝世是国际工人阶级的无可挽回的损失。但是斯大林的事业必将永垂不朽，他的天才的著作和遗训必将永远活在最广大的劳动人民群众中，发生日益增大的影响。我们所遭遇到的极大的损失使我们必须更进一步发展并加强工人和人民群众队伍中的团结，为工会权利和民主权利、为民族独立和世界和平而斗争。反动派和战争贩子不久就会看到，各国劳动人民因斯大林逝世而感到的无穷悲痛，将成为一种惊人的活力的泉源。这种活力将进一步加强全世界劳动人民对列宁与斯大林的伟大的共产党的信任，巩固各国劳动人民与伟大的、不可战胜的苏联的团结，将使全世界争取和平、自由与人类进步的运动更加活跃、坚强而所向无敌。
      世界工联总书记赛扬发表告全世界工人书
    世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬发表告全世界工人书说：“每一个工人对伟大斯大林的逝世都感到一种切身的悲痛，全世界人民都感觉到：伟大斯大林的逝世是不可弥补的损失。和列宁一起创造了世界上第一个多民族社会主义国家的斯大林同志，向全世界工人证实：全世界人民有可能建立共享平等的生活，有可能彻底废除各种形式的歧视。斯大林同志鼓舞起全世界人民争取民族独立、民主、自由的不可抗拒的意志，而全世界人民的决定性的力量就是工人阶级。世界工联和全世界的工人同样感到无限的悲痛，谨向全苏工会中央理事会、向苏联人民以及和他们密切关联分不开的苏联政府致以亲切的慰问。斯大林同志是工人阶级国际主义的旗手。忠实于工人阶级国际主义精神的世界工联，号召全世界的工人紧密团结，并进一步加强与那些工人已成为自己命运的主人的国家之间的兄弟般的联系和无间的团结，这些国家是和平民主阵营的不可动摇的堡垒。世界工联同时号召全世界工人：要使这一兄弟般的团结更具有活力，以保证约·维·斯大林终身致力的进步、自由、幸福、和平与生活丰足这些伟大的不可战胜的理想获得胜利。”
      国际民主妇联发表告全世界妇女书
    国际民主妇女联合会发表了告全世界妇女书说：
      “斯大林宣告人是最珍贵的财产，他把政府的注意力集中于对儿童的关怀，这样，他使妇女们所最珍爱的愿望成为现实，因为对于一个母亲没有比她的孩子是更为珍爱的。斯大林是伟大的和平事业的钢铁战士，他将得到世世代代的妇女和母亲们的感谢。
    约·维·斯大林毕生致力的事业将永垂不朽。
    国际民主妇女联合会表达了妇女与母亲们的极度悲痛，要求全世界妇女加强与和平民主的堡垒——苏联的妇女的友好联系，加倍努力并尽全力保卫自由、民主与和平，与本国人民一起建立一个和平环境，以便使进步与科学可以促进世界人民的繁荣。
    斯大林将永远活在全世界妇女的心里。”
