Gross Cannot Deny the Crime of the United States Conducting Germ Warfare
Jiang Nan

On March 27th, the United States representative Gross delivered a speech in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, attempting to deny the crime of the United States conducting germ warfare in Korea. However, Gross did not achieve his goal.

The facts of the American aggressors committing heinous germ warfare in Korea have long been confirmed by numerous conclusive material and human evidence. The "Investigative Mission of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers," the Chinese "Investigation Team on the Crimes of American Imperialism in Germ Warfare," and especially the "International Scientific Commission for Investigating the Facts of Germ Warfare in Korea and China," composed of world-renowned scientists, have all conducted thorough on-the-spot investigations. Their investigations unanimously confirmed that the American army used bacteriological weapons in Korea. In addition, many U.S. Air Force personnel who directly participated in germ warfare in Korea under the orders of the U.S. government have fallen into the hands of the Korean and Chinese side. Driven by human conscience, they confessed to the facts of the United States conducting germ warfare in Korea. From the confessions of American Air Force prisoners of war Inak, Quinn, O'Neill, Knise, Schweible, and Blea, people can clearly see the United States government's plan to conduct germ warfare in Korea and its implementation.

The U.S. government has never been able to produce any tenable arguments to deny all this human and material evidence. Apart from stubbornly claiming that this was "Communist propaganda," it has always avoided discussing the specific content of this evidence. The day before Gross delivered his speech to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, the Associated Press reported that "American sources" in the United Nations claimed that Gross would be different this time, that he "will provide evidence" to "prove" that the accusations about germ warfare were "fabricated." These "American sources" also predicted that Gross was "certain" to deliver a "fierce counterattack speech." But in the end, Gross still could not provide any "evidence" other than empty talk.

Gross's speech shows that the U.S. government is particularly afraid of the fact that U.S. Air Force prisoners of war have confessed to the U.S. conducting germ warfare. Gross used many words to deny the confessions of these prisoners of war, attempting to portray them as so-called "propaganda." However, no matter how Gross argued, he did not dare to touch any of the specific content of these confessions. Gross could only emptily attempt to prove that these confessions were "deceptive" from "general phrases" and "specific statements," and attempted to ask the world to "not believe" many facts in these confessions that even Gross himself could not deny.

In order to prove that the confessions of American Air Force prisoners of war were all so-called "propaganda," Gross brought out the set of methods used by American intelligence agencies to extract confessions and applied them to the Korean and Chinese side, insisting that the Korean and Chinese side also used these methods to obtain the confessions of American Air Force prisoners of war. Gross listed many methods, showing that he himself was a true expert in this area. These methods are: "depriving you of sleep for long periods"; injecting a serum into the spine; "forcing you to maintain a rigid posture for long periods of time"; in addition, there are many so-called "psychological methods."

Anyone can see that as long as one of the methods introduced by Gross is used, the prisoner of war can be put in a state of mental confusion. How can they write such clear confessions as those written by Schweible, Blea, O'Neill, Knise, Inak, and Quinn? In all these prisoners of war's confessions, there is a large amount of accurate and unchangeable information about the time, place, names, positions, meetings, instructions, lecture content, and many extremely complex technical processes related to the U.S. military's germ warfare. Is it conceivable that a mentally deranged prisoner of war can write such a well-organized, accurate, and detailed confession?

Particularly ridiculous is that Gross, on the one hand, said that these confessions were made using the methods he introduced, but on the other hand, he did not dare to deny any of the facts provided in these confessions. Just to give one example, Staff Officer Schweible of the First Marine Air Wing said in his confession: In March 1952, the First Photographic Squadron (VMJ-1) of the Thirty-third Air Group of the First Marine Air Wing was ordered to participate in the germ warfare program. "VMJ-1 used the K-3 base of the Thirty-third Air Group of the Marine Corps in Pohang, Korea, and used F2H-2P photographic reconnaissance aircraft (Banshee)." Why didn't Gross dare to make any defense against these unit numbers, bases, aircraft types, and missions? It is very clear that this is because it cannot be denied!

Gross himself also knew that simply denying it out of thin air could not in the slightest degree offset the huge impact of the confessions of American Air Force prisoners of war around the world. Therefore, he fancifully requested that these prisoners of war be sent to a so-called "neutral area" and handed over to a so-called "impartial United Nations committee" to be "responsible for detention." After a "period of time" of "restoring normality," this "committee" would then question them, asking them to "confirm or deny" the facts cited in their confessions.

Only a blind person could fail to see the naive and ridiculous conspiracy contained in Gross's plan. Gross vainly attempted to hand over American Air Force prisoners of war to a mercenary "committee," and then use threats and inducements from American secret service agencies to "restore" their "normality"; in other words, to force them to overturn their confessions. The U.S. government's attempt to overturn the confessions of American Air Force prisoners of war using such a shameless method cannot deceive anyone. This, in turn, proves that the U.S. government has run out of tricks and can no longer cover up its serious crime of conducting germ warfare.

In addition to attempting to overturn the confessions of American Air Force prisoners of war, Gross also requested that the United Nations General Assembly establish a so-called "investigation committee" to conduct a so-called "impartial investigation" into the accusations of the U.S. military conducting germ warfare. Moreover, according to Gross's request, this so-called "investigation committee" should also have the right to "move freely in North Korea, South Korea, mainland China, and Japan," and should also have "the freedom to meet people it deems necessary, go to places it deems necessary, and obtain documents it deems necessary." Such a so-called "investigation committee" has no more appropriate name than to say that it is a special detachment sent by the American intelligence agency to collect information on the U.S. military's germ warfare. It is very clear that the U.S. government, which is still conducting germ warfare, urgently needs first-hand information on the effectiveness of germ warfare. This is the real purpose of Gross's proposal.

The absurdity of Gross's proposal is made even more obvious by his attempt to pass all responsibility for conducting germ warfare to the "United Nations." Gross said that the accusations about germ warfare are not attacking the United States, but "the United Nations itself." So, according to Gross's statement, the United Nations itself should conduct an "impartial investigation" into the matter it is accused of. Gross here falls into the extreme logical confusion that American politicians often make. In fact, Gross is attempting to use the "United Nations" as a shield for the U.S. government to deflect the world's condemnation of the U.S. government. However, everyone knows that all the confessions of American Air Force prisoners of war have unanimously admitted that germ warfare was conducted completely secretly and solely by the American military. American prisoner of war Schweible admitted in his confession that the American military adopted strict confidentiality measures towards its allies when conducting germ warfare, and that they "take all possible steps to limit information about the use of this weapon and control information about this issue." Gross's method of passing the responsibility to the "United Nations" only exposes the U.S. government's guilty conscience.

    葛罗斯抵赖不掉美国进行细菌战的罪行
    江南
    三月二十七日，美国代表葛罗斯在联合国大会政治委员会上发表演说，企图抵赖美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行。可是，葛罗斯并没有达到他的目的。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜进行罪恶滔天的细菌战的事实，早已为许多确凿的物证和人证所证实。“国际民主法律工作者协会调查团”，中国的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”，特别是由世界权威科学家组成的“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”，都实地作了充分的调查。他们的调查一致证实美国军队在朝鲜使用了细菌武器。除此之外，有许多按照美国政府的命令直接参与在朝鲜进行细菌战的美国空军人员已经落入朝中方面手中。他们在人类良知的驱使下，供认了美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的事实。从美国空军战俘伊纳克、奎恩、奥尼尔、克尼斯、许威布尔、布莱的供词中，人们已经可以清楚地看到美国政府在朝鲜进行细菌战的计划和它的实施。
    对于所有这些人证和物证，美国政府从来提不出任何站得住脚的论据来加以抵赖。它除了硬着头皮出来说这是“共产党宣传”而外，对于这些证据的具体内容一向避而不谈。在葛罗斯向联合国大会政治委员会发表演说之前一天，合众社曾经报道说，联合国中的“美国人士”宣称，葛罗斯这次将要与众不同了，他“将提供证据”，“证明”关于细菌战的指责是“捏造”的。这些“美国人士”还预言葛罗斯“一定”要发表“猛烈的反击演说”。可是结果，葛罗斯仍然除了空口说白话而外，什么“证据”也提不出来。
    葛罗斯的演说表明：美国政府对于美国空军被俘人员供认美国进行细菌战这一事实，特别感到害怕。葛罗斯用了许多话来否定这些战俘的供词，企图把它们说成是一种所谓“宣传”。可是葛罗斯说来说去，怎么也不敢碰一下这些供词里面的任何一点具体内容。葛罗斯只能空空洞洞地企图从“一般词句上”和“具体说法上”来证明这些供词“都是骗人的”，并且企图凭空要全世界“不应该”相信这些供词里面连葛罗斯自己也无法抵赖的许多事实。
    为了想证明美国空军战俘的供词都是所谓“宣传”，葛罗斯把美国特务机关用来逼供的一套办法都搬出来加在朝中方面头上，硬说朝中方面也是用这些办法得到美国空军战俘的供词的。葛罗斯列举了许多办法，显出他自己是这方面的真正行家。这些办法是：“使你长时失眠”；在脊椎上注射一种血清；“强迫你在长时间内保持僵直的姿势”；此外，还有许多所谓“心理的办法”。
    谁都可以看得出来，只要把葛罗斯介绍的办法用上一种，就可以使战俘处于神经错乱的地步，他们还怎么能写得出像许威布尔、布莱、奥尼尔、克尼斯、伊纳克、奎恩所写的那样清楚的供词呢？在所有这些战俘的供词中间，都有着大量的准确而无法更改的有关美军进行细菌战的时间、地点、人名、职别、会议、训令、讲授内容、和许多极复杂的技术过程。一个神经错乱的战俘能写出这样条理分明、确实详明的供词，这难道是可以想像的事情？
    特别可笑的是：葛罗斯一方面说这些供词都是用他所介绍的办法制造出来的，一方面却不敢否认这些供词中所提供的任何一项事实。随便举一个例子来说，美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长许威布尔在他的供词中说：一九五二年三月，美国海军陆战队第一空军联队第三十三空军大队第一照相中队
    （VMJ—1）奉命参预细菌战计划。“VMJ—1以海军陆战队第三十三空军大队在朝鲜浦项的K—3为基地，使用F2H—2P型的照相侦察机
    （女妖式）”。葛罗斯为什么不敢对这些部队番号、基地、飞机类型、任务作任何辩解呢？十分明显，这是因为抵赖不得！
    葛罗斯自己也知道，光凭空口否认是丝毫抵销不了美国空军战俘的供词在全世界引起的巨大影响的，因此，他就异想天开，要求把这些战俘送到一个所谓“中立地区”去，把他们交给一个所谓“公正的联合国委员会”去“负责拘留”。在经过“一个时候”的“恢复正常”以后，再由这个“委员会”来询问他们，要求他们来“证实或否认”他们供词中所举的事实。
    葛罗斯的计划中所包含的幼稚可笑的阴谋，只有瞎子才看不出来。葛罗斯妄想把美国空军战俘交给御用的“委员会”，然后由美国特务机关用威胁利诱的办法来“恢复”他们的“正常”；换句话说，强迫他们推翻自己的供词。美国政府企图用这样无耻的办法来推翻美国空军战俘的供词，是欺骗不了任何人的，这反过来证明：美国政府已经黔驴技穷，再也无法掩盖它进行细菌战的严重罪行了。
    葛罗斯除了企图推翻美国空军战俘的供词而外，还要求由联合国大会成立一个所谓“调查委员会”来对美军进行细菌战的指责进行所谓“公正的调查”。而且，照葛罗斯的要求，这个所谓“调查委员会”还应当有权“在北朝鲜、南朝鲜、中国大陆和日本等地自由行动”，还“应当有接见它认为必要的人、到它认为必要的地方、获得它认为必要的文件的自由”。这样的一个所谓“调查委员会”，除了说它是美国情报机关派来搜集美军进行细菌战情报的特遣队以外，再没有更恰当的名称了。很明显，还在继续进行细菌战的美国政府，正迫切需要关于细菌战效果的第一手情报。这就是葛罗斯的建议的真正目的。
    葛罗斯这个建议的荒谬性，由于他企图把进行细菌战的全部责任推给“联合国”而显得更明显了。葛罗斯说，关于细菌战的指责所攻击的不是美国，而是“联合国本身”。那末，照葛罗斯的说法，就是要由联合国自己来对它所被指责的事情进行“公正的调查”。葛罗斯在这里陷入了美国政客们常犯的逻辑上的极度混乱。事实上，葛罗斯是企图把“联合国”当作美国政府的挡箭牌，来招架全世界对美国政府的斥责。但是，谁都知道，所有美国空军战俘的供词都已经众口一词地承认，细菌战是完全由美国军队单独秘密进行的。美国战俘许威布尔在他的供词中承认，美国军队在进行细菌战的时候，对于它的盟国都采取严格的保密措施，对它们
    “要采取一切可能的步骤来限制关于使用这种武器的消息并控制关于这个问题的情报”。葛罗斯这种把责任推给“联合国”的手法，只是暴露了美国政府的作贼心虚罢了。
