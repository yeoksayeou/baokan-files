Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 7th. TASS reported: The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union issued a circular to all Young Communist League members and all Soviet youth, stating: The Communist Party, the Soviet people, and the working people of the world are immersed in deep sorrow. The genius of mankind, the great comrade and friend of Lenin, the successor to Lenin's immortal cause, the tireless builder of communism, our leader, dear father, friend and wise mentor of Soviet youth, J.V. Stalin, has passed away. Comrade Stalin dedicated his entire heroic life, wholeheartedly, to the people, to the Party, to the prosperity of our motherland, and to the great cause of communism. Comrade Stalin, together with Lenin, established the Communist Party, educated it, and tempered it. Comrade Stalin, together with Lenin, was the inspirer and leader of the great October Socialist Revolution and the founder of the first socialist country in the world. Comrade Stalin inherited Lenin's immortal cause and led the Soviet people to achieve the world-historically significant victory of building socialism in our country. Under the wise leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people won the great victory of defeating the dark forces of fascism during World War II. Comrade Stalin's great and clear program for communist construction armed the Party and all the people and pointed out the path to the bright and magnificent peak of communism. In every labor achievement of the Soviet people, in every new victory of communist construction, the wisdom, vigorous energy, and iron will of our leader, Comrade Stalin, are embodied. The name of Stalin is the most beloved and closest to the young men and women of the Soviet Union and to all Soviet people. For each of us, Stalin's life is a great example of selfless struggle for communism. In these sorrowful days, young men and women of the Young Communist League and all Soviet youth solemnly vow to all the Soviet people: We must always be loyal and firm children of the glorious Communist Party, we must be ardent patriots of the Soviet motherland, we must dedicate our entire lives to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin, and to the struggle for the victory of communism. Young men and women of the Young Communist League and Soviet youth guarantee to the dear Communist Party and its Stalinist Central Committee: We must always be vigilant and ready, under any circumstances, to defend the beloved Soviet motherland, even at the cost of our lives. The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League calls on all Young Communist League members and all Soviet youth to unite more closely around the Communist Party, the Stalinist Central Committee, and the Soviet government, and to dedicate all their strength and all their creative energy to the great cause of building communism in our country. The young men and women of the Soviet Union will forever remember in their hearts the immortal and heroic name of the great Stalin, who is infinitely dear to the Soviet people and the working people of the world.
