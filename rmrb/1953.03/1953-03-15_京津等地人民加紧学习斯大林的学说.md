The eagerness to intensify the study of Stalin's theories is clearly reflected in the enthusiastic purchase of Stalin's works and the organization of study groups by the people of cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Jinan, and Hangzhou.

The Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch added six book stands displaying Stalin's works on the 7th. By the 8th, more than 20,000 copies of Stalin's works had been sold. "A Concise Biography of Stalin" was sold out early due to limited stock, and readers have been requesting a quick reprint. The International Bookstore Beijing store sold more than 4,700 copies of Russian versions of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," and "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" on the 7th and 8th. The Russian and English versions of "A Concise Biography of Stalin" have been sold out, and more than 70 copies of the remaining Japanese version have also been sold. Readers are eagerly inquiring when the Russian version of "A Concise Biography of Stalin" will be available. On the 8th, the number of invoice clerks at the store was increased from four to twelve, but they were still overwhelmed. The Xinhua Bookstore Tianjin Branch also set up a special counter to display Stalin's works. The 1,000 copies of "A Concise Biography of Stalin" that arrived on the 10th were sold out in less than an hour. Many readers who could not buy the book pre-ordered it from the bookstore. The Nankai University Library wants to buy as many copies as possible of every kind of Stalin's works. Students from Tianjin University and Nankai University, after buying the Russian version of "A Concise Biography of Stalin" and "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," expressed that they must learn Russian well in a short period of time. A primary school student used his saved-up snack money to buy a comic book titled "Long Live Stalin," expressing that he would study Stalin's great spirit diligently. By the 11th, the Xinhua Bookstore Xi'an store had sold out all of Stalin's works on linguistics, as well as "Reference Materials for Studying 'Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR,'" and "Stalin and the Chinese Revolution." Some readers who could not buy the books negotiated with the bookstore to buy the books displayed in the window. The bookstore staff had to put out their own copies of "A Concise Biography of Stalin" and other books for display. Workers, students, and farmers also flocked to buy pictures of Stalin. The China Book Company's store in Xi'an immediately sold out the twenty posters of "Comrade Stalin Leads Us to Victory" as soon as they were put out.

In order to intensify the study of Stalin's great theories, cadres and workers from various organs, schools, and trade union organizations have voluntarily formed study groups for Stalin's works. The Party School of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has been studying "A Concise Biography of Stalin" for two hours every day since the 7th. The Northwest Art Institute has established a "Stalin's Works Reading Room" and held a "Stalin's Life Picture Exhibition." All teachers and students decided to carefully read one of Stalin's works each from the 7th to the 9th. One hundred and eighteen members of the Communist Youth League of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions are collectively studying "A Concise Biography of Stalin" in order to learn the revolutionary spirit and noble qualities of Comrade Stalin. Some organs and schools in Hangzhou are also preparing to hold exhibitions of Stalin's works or pictures of Stalin's life and career in order to better learn from the great teacher Comrade Stalin.

    京津等地人民加紧学习斯大林的学说
    要加紧学习斯大林的学说的这种心情，从北京、天津、西安、济南、杭州等城市的人民踊跃购买斯大林著作及组织学习的行动上，明显地反映出来。
    新华书店北京分店从七日起就增设了六个陈列斯大林著作的书台。到八日为止，已售出斯大林著作两万多册。“斯大林传略”因存书不多，早已售完，读者纷纷要求迅速再版。国际书店北京门市部七、八两天售出俄文“联共（布）党史简明教程”、“马克思主义与语言学问题”及“苏联社会主义经济问题”等书四千七百多册。俄文及英文版的“斯大林传略”已销售一空，剩下的日文版的一种，也已售出七十多册；读者殷切地询问俄文的“斯大林传略”何时可到。八日，该店的开票员由四个人增加到十二个人，但仍忙不过来。新华书店天津分店门市部也特设专台陈列斯大林的著作。十日刚到一千部“斯大林传略”，不到一小时就卖完了。很多没有买到书的读者，都向书店预购。南开大学图书馆凡是斯大林的著作有多少种就要买多少种。天津大学、南开大学的学生在买了俄文版的“斯大林传略”和“联共（布）党史简明教程”后，表示一定要在短期内学好俄文。一个小学生用他积累了多日的点心钱买了一部“斯大林万岁”的连环画，表示要好好学习斯大林的伟大精神。新华书店西安门市部到十一日止，所有斯大林语言学的著作以及“学习‘苏联社会主义经济问题’参考资料”、“斯大林和中国革命”等书都售完了。有的读者买不到书，就和书店商量，把橱窗里陈列的书也买走了。书店的工作人员于是只好把自己的“斯大林传略”等书拿出来陈列。工人、学生、农民还纷纷购买有关斯大林的图片。中国图书公司在西安的门市部刚拿出二十张“斯大林同志引导我们走向胜利”的招贴画，立刻就卖完了。
    为了加紧学习斯大林的伟大学说，各地机关、学校、工会组织的干部和工人，自动成立了学习斯大林著作的小组。中共中央西北局党校从七日起，每天以两小时学习“斯大林传略”。西北艺术学院设立了“斯大林遗著阅览室”，并举办了“斯大林生平图片展览会”。全校师生决定在七日到九日，每人精读斯大林的遗著一篇。山东省总工会有一百一十八名青年团团员，为了学习斯大林同志的革命精神和高贵品质，正集体学习“斯大林传略”。杭州市有些机关和学校也准备举行斯大林著作或斯大林生平事业图片的展览会，以便更好地向伟大的导师斯大林同志学习。　（新华社）
