    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Ulaanbaatar, as reported by TASS: The Mongolian "Truth" newspaper published the resolution of the regular meeting of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party held in early March. Based on the report by Central Committee Secretary Damba regarding the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan (from 1948 to 1952) for the development of the national economy and culture of the Mongolian People's Republic, and the tasks of the 1953 national economic plan, the resolution pointed out that the Mongolian People's Republic achieved significant successes in developing animal husbandry, industry, transportation, post and telecommunications, education, and health during the first Five-Year Plan. For example, the total number of livestock nationwide in 1952 increased by 8.7 percent compared to 1947; the individual herder economy increased by 7.1 percent; state-owned farms increased by 112.5 percent; and livestock production cooperatives increased 5.5 times.

    The task of expanding veterinary organs was also over-fulfilled. The Republic's industry is already able to produce some new veterinary medicines, and it fulfilled 143.8 percent of its production plan. The Five-Year Plan for increasing the cultivated area of state-owned farms was fulfilled by 151.1 percent. The grain harvest plan was fulfilled by 112.5 percent, and the area of hayfields was expanded by 105.5 percent.

    During the first Five-Year Plan period, the Mongolian people, relying on the assistance of the Soviet Union, continuously developed their own industry. The total industrial production volume increased by an average of 9.8 percent annually during the Five-Year Plan. Calculated at the constant value of 1943, the total industrial output of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1952 increased by 151 percent compared to 1947. Labor productivity increased by 28.8 percent, and product costs decreased by 17.5 percent. During the Five-Year Plan period, the Stalin Railway was built with the help of the Soviet Union and is already open to traffic.

    The total investment in the national economy during the Five-Year Plan amounted to 202,445,800 tugriks. The industrial investment plan was fulfilled by 104.6 percent, and agricultural investment in 1952 increased more than nine times compared to 1947. A large amount of investment was made in the urban construction of Ulaanbaatar, and the appearance of the Mongolian capital has greatly changed. Currently, the overall plan for transforming Ulaanbaatar is being drafted.

    The Five-Year Plans for health and education were greatly overfulfilled. During the Five-Year Plan period, the plan to expand the hospital network and clinic network was fulfilled by 110.2 percent, and the number of doctors doubled. The plan to expand the network of universal education schools was overfulfilled. The number of primary school students increased by 84.4 percent, the number of seven-year school students increased by 33.3 percent, the number of ten-year school students tripled, the number of vocational school students increased by 27 percent, and the number of university students doubled. The task of eliminating illiteracy was basically solved during the Five-Year Plan period, and 99 percent of adults in the country are now literate.

    In addition to these achievements, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the People's Revolutionary Party also pointed out the shortcomings in the implementation of the plan. One of the biggest shortcomings is that the plan to increase the total number of livestock in the individual herder economy was not fulfilled.

    The plenary session of the Central Committee instructed the Political Bureau of the Central Committee to begin drafting the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and culture of the Mongolian People's Republic for 1953-1957. The resolution also formulated measures for implementing the 1953 national economic plan. The resolution on strengthening livestock production cooperatives organizationally and economically analyzed the reasons for the serious shortcomings existing in livestock cooperatives. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party demanded that party organizations and government organizations improve their leadership over livestock production cooperatives. It was decided to revise and supplement the trial charter of livestock production cooperatives in the near future, and to allocate and fix pastures, hayfields, and cultivated land for livestock production cooperatives in 1953. The plenary session also formulated some other measures regarding the transformation of livestock production cooperatives into exemplary collectivized units.

    In its editorial commenting on the resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian "Truth" newspaper called on party members and all working people to intensify their efforts to achieve new successes in the country's economy and culture. The newspaper wrote: Now, when all progressive humanity, including the Mongolian people, is grieving over the death of the great Stalin, we must unite even more closely around the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party under the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and strive to build socialism in our country.

    蒙古执行第一个五年计划获得巨大成绩
    正着手拟订发展经济和文化的第二个五年计划
    据新华社讯：据塔斯社乌兰巴托讯：蒙古“真理报”刊载了蒙古人民革命党中央委员会在三月初举行的全体会议例会的决议。决议根据中央委员会书记达姆巴所做的关于发展蒙古人民共和国国民经济和文化的第一个五年计划（自一九四八年到一九五二年）执行情形以及一九五三年国民经济计划的任务的报告指出，蒙古人民共和国在第一个五年计划期间，在发展畜牧业、工业、运输、邮电、教育和卫生方面获得了很大的成绩。例如，全国牲畜的总头数一九五二年就比一九四七年增加了百分之八点七；个体牧民经济增加百分之七点一；国营农场增加百分之一百一十二点五；畜牧业生产合作社增加了五点五倍。
    在扩大兽医机关方面也超计划完成了任务。共和国的工业已能生产一些新的兽医药剂，它完成了生产计划百分之一百四十三点八。在增加国营农场耕地面积方面完成了五年计划的百分之一百五十一点一。谷物的收成计划完成了百分之一百一十二点五，割草场的面积扩大了百分之一百零五点五。
    蒙古人民在第一个五年计划时期依靠苏联的帮助不断地发展了自己的工业。五年计划中工业生产总量平均每年增加百分之九点八。蒙古人民共和国工业总产量以一九四三年的不变价值计算，一九五二年就比一九四七年增加了百分之一百五十一。劳动生产率提高了百分之二十八点八，产品成本降低了百分之十七点五。在五年计划期中依靠苏联的帮助建筑了一条斯大林铁路，并已通车。
    五年计划中在国民经济方面的投资共有二○二、四四五、八○○图格里克。工业投资计划完成了百分之一百零四点六，一九五二年农业的投资比一九四七年增加了九倍多。对乌兰巴托城市建设作了大量投资，蒙古首都的面貌大大改观了。现在，改造乌兰巴托的总计划正在拟订着。
    卫生和教育方面的五年计划大大地超额完成了。在五年计划期间，扩大医院网和诊疗站网的计划完成了百分之一百一十点二，医生的数目增加了两倍。扩大普及教育学校网的计划超额完成了。小学校学生的数目增加了百分之八十四点四，七年制学校学生的数目增加了百分之三十三点三，十年制学校学生的数目增加了三倍，职业学校学生的数目增加了百分之二十七，高等学校学生的数目增加了一倍。扫除文盲的任务，在五年计划期间基本上解决了，国内百分之九十九的成年人都识字了。
    除了这些成绩以外，人民革命党中央委员会全体会议还指出了执行计划中的缺点。最大的缺点之一就是个体牧民经济中牲畜总头数增加的计划并没有完成。
    中央委员会全体会议责成中央委员会政治局着手拟订一九五三—一九五七年发展蒙古人民共和国国民经济和文化的第二个五年计划。决议还拟定了执行一九五三年国民经济计划的措施。关于在组织上和经济上加强畜牧业生产合作社的决议，分析了畜牧业组合中存在严重缺点的原因。蒙古人民革命党中央委员会全体会议要求党组织和政府组织改进对畜牧业生产合作社的领导。决定在最近修改和补充畜牧业生产合作社的试行章程，并在一九五三年给畜牧业生产合作社分配牧场、割草场、耕地并加以固定。全体会议并且拟定了关于把畜牧业生产合作社改为示范性的集体化的一些其他措施。
    蒙古“真理报”社论在评论人民革命党中央委员会全体会议决议时，号召党员和全体劳动人民加紧努力在国家的经济和文化方面获得新的成就。报纸写道：现在，当全体进步人类、包括蒙古人民在内，因伟大的斯大林逝世而感到悲痛时，要更加紧密地在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的旗帜下团结在蒙古人民革命党的周围，为在我国建设社会主义而奋斗。
