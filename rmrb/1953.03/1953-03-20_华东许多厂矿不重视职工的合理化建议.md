East China: Many Factories and Mines Do Not Value Workers' Rationalization Proposals

    According to the Shanghai Liberation Daily, the failure of leading cadres in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in East China to value workers' rationalization proposals has become a widespread problem. The leading cadres in these factories and mines generally hold the following incorrect attitudes toward workers' rationalization proposals:

    The first is to treat rationalization proposals as a crash campaign. At first, it is a grand affair, but after a gust of wind, it disappears without a trace. Huang Chengshu, Zhou Rujuan, and others from the State-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill reported that during last year's labor competition, the factory leaders called on all workers to find tricks, tap potential, and put forward rationalization proposals. They also adopted the method of "rewarding topics" and established research groups for cleaning cotton, roving, spinning, and looms, gathering some workers who were detached from production to study them. Due to the strong promotion by the leaders, workers in the factory put forward 822 rationalization proposals in one month last July. However, after the climax passed, it slowly cooled down. Up to now, more than 200 rationalization proposals in the factory have not been processed, and most of the research groups have become empty shells. Some suggestions that should be rewarded are not rewarded, and those that should be promoted are not promoted. For example, workers in the three spinning steel car created a method of grinding cars, which can increase production and save 1.6 billion yuan annually if promoted throughout the factory, but the workers have not yet received the bonus. As a result, the number of rationalization proposals submitted in August dropped sharply to 42, then to 6 in October, and only 3 remained by December. Workers in the No. 2 Spinning Workshop said that this practice actually treats rationalization proposals as decorations to decorate the facade. After displaying them, the suggestions formed by the workers' hard work are thrown into the trash heap like waste paper.

    The second is to superficially perfunctory, but actually ignore them. Zhang Guoxin from Longhua Cement Factory said that the temperature is high and there is a lot of dust in the kiln workshop of the factory. In order to change this situation, the workers have submitted 50 to 60 suggestions to the leaders, but the leaders rarely adopt or consider them. Sometimes when the workers urge them, they verbally respond, saying, "Yes, yes, your opinion is very valuable." After a period of perfunctory remarks, they continue to delay and do not deal with it. The Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory also has the same situation. Shen Leisheng, a veteran technician of the factory, has successively submitted several suggestions to the administration since 1951 on improving the loom shuttle box spring, the ground shaft cam cover, and the iron block press head under the disc head. If these suggestions are implemented, they can play a considerable role in maintaining the machine, saving materials, and reducing the labor intensity of workers. However, after the leaders received these suggestions, they have never dealt with them. When Shen Leisheng asked, the leading cadres said, "Good, good!" After saying that, they still ignored it. In addition, readers Wu Zhengong and Di Hen reported that the leading cadres of the Shanghai Public Transport Company and the loom department of the State-owned Shanghai No. 4 Cotton Mill also often treat workers' rationalization proposals with this perfunctory and indifferent attitude. The leaders of the public transport company often write on the rationalization proposal forms submitted by workers: "Not to be adopted," "Still under study," "To be discussed later," "Difficult to implement," "Further study is needed," "For administrative reference," "To be resolved during the ×× movement"... etc., in order to delay and "block".

    There is also a kind that firmly refuses to adopt them, and even uses various methods to打击(dǎjī - suppress, attack) the enthusiasm of the workers. Reader Qian Qiyan reported that in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" last year, almost every production team in the grinding machine assembly workshop of the Qiujiang Machine Factory put forward two or three rationalization proposals, but so far, most of these proposals are still sleeping on the desks of the leading cadres. Some workers went to inquire, and the leading cadres replied, "Comrades, the suggestions you put forward are too small and have little effect." They even said, "How can this be considered a rationalization proposal?" Another example is Liu Longsheng's report: Wang Lanqing, the director of the workshop of the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Factory, put forward a rationalization proposal to engineer Lin Yuxiang in July 1951 on improving the quality of the rolls. At that time, Lin did not accept it, so he went to the factory director Xu Guoxiu, who claimed that the engineer had not approved it and did not accept it either. Wang Lanqing had no choice but to hand over this suggestion to the responsible cadre of the car roll team for private testing. As a result, the pass rate of finished products was increased to 93% to 99%. When Wang saw that the results were indeed good, he filled out a rationalization proposal form and sent it to the technical section. Who knew that after Lin Yuxiang and the head of the technical section saw the form, they scolded Wang in person, saying, "You are too bold!" At the same time, he also blamed the workers in the workshop for doing it secretly without the consent of the technical section. Later, it was only with great difficulty that this proposal was submitted to the Mining and Metallurgy Bureau. The Mining and Metallurgy Bureau thought it was good and immediately issued a bonus of 3 million yuan and a banner. The leading cadres, in a helpless situation, came up with an idea, saying that the bonus should be shared equally and not given to Wang alone. This method of handling made the workers in the workshop generally dissatisfied.

### 华东许多厂矿不重视职工的合理化建议

    华东许多厂矿不重视职工的合理化建议
    据上海解放日报载，华东区国营工矿企业的领导干部不重视职工的合理化建议，已成为带有普遍性的问题。这些厂矿的领导干部对职工的合理化建议，大致有以下几种不正确的态度：
    第一种是把合理化建议当作突击运动，起初轰轰烈烈，一阵风过去了，就烟消云散。国营上海第十七棉纺织厂黄成书、周如娟等反映：去年劳动竞赛中，该厂领导上号召全厂职工找窍门、挖潜力、提合理化建议，还采用“课题悬赏”的办法，成立清棉、粗纱、细纱、布机等研究小组，调集一部分脱离生产的职工专门研究。由于领导上大力提倡，去年七月份一个月内，全厂职工就提出合理化建议八百二十二件。但是，高潮过去后，就慢慢冷了下来，到现在厂内还有两百多件合理化建议未处理，绝大部分的研究小组变成了空架子，有些建议该发奖金不发，该推广不推广。如三纺钢丝车工人创造了磨车工作法，在全厂推广，每年可增产节约十六亿元，但工人们至今还未领到奖金。这样，八月份所提合理化建议就猛减到四十二件，十月份再减到六件，到十二月份，只剩三件了。二纺工场工人说：这种做法，实际上是把合理化建议看作装饰门面的摆设，陈列一下以后，就将工人心血结成的建议，像废纸一样丢到垃圾堆去了。
    第二种是表面上敷衍应付，实际上不闻不问。龙华水泥厂张国信说：该厂大窑车间的温度高、灰尘多，工人为了改变这种情况，前后向领导上提出五六十件建议，但领导上很少采纳或考虑，有时工人催得紧了，他就口头应付说：“是，是，你的意见很宝贵。”敷衍一阵以后，依然拖延下去，不处理。光中染织厂也有同样情形，该厂老技工申雷声从一九五一年起，接连向行政上提出关于改进布机梭箱弹簧、地轴桃盘罩子和盘头下面的铁块压头等好几个建议，如果这些建议都实行的话，对保养机器、节约用料、减轻工人劳动强度可起相当作用。但领导上接到这些建议后，始终没有处理。当申雷声追问时，领导干部就说：“好的，好的！”说了以后，仍旧不闻不问。此外，该报读者吴真公、敌恨等反映，上海市公共交通公司和国营上海第四棉纺织厂布机间的领导干部，也往往以这种敷衍应付、不闻不问的态度来对待工人的合理化建议。公共交通公司领导上常在工人所提的合理化建议表上批：“不拟采用”、“还待研究”、“以后再说”、“执行尚有困难”、“要进一步研究”、“供行政参考”、“在××运动时解决”……等字样，借以拖拉和“挡驾”。
    还有一种是坚决不采纳，甚至用种种办法来打击工人的积极性。该报读者钱启炎反映：虬江机器厂磨床装配车间在去年“中苏友好月”中，差不多每个生产小组都提了两三件合理化建议，但到现在为止，这些建议大部分还睡在领导干部的办公桌里，有些工人去询问，领导干部便回答说：“同志，你提的建议太小了，没有多大作用。”甚至说：“这怎么能算合理化建议呢？”又如刘龙生反映：上海钢铁二厂车间主任王兰庆在一九五一年七月间向工程师林裕祥提了一个关于改进轧辊品质的合理化建议，当时林不接受，他就提到厂长徐国修那里去，徐推称工程师没批准，也不接受。王兰庆没法，只好将这个建议交给车辘组的负责干部私下试验，结果使成品合格率提高到百分之九十三到九十九。王见成绩确实不错，就填写了合理化建议书送到技术课，谁知单子被林裕祥和技术课课长看到后，竟当面骂王道：“你的胆子太大了！”同时还责备车间的工人说：没有经过技术课同意，为什么偷偷地做。后来好容易才把这个建议呈报到矿冶局去，矿冶局认为不错，当即发下奖金三百万元及锦旗一面，领导干部在无可奈何的情况下，又想出一个主意，说这奖金要平分，不能发给王一人。这种处理方法使得车间工人普遍不满。
