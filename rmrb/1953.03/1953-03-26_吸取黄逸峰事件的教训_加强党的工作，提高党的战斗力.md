Learn from the Huang Yifeng Incident: Strengthen Party Work and Enhance Party Combat Effectiveness
Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

The expulsion of the anti-Party element Huang Yifeng from the Party is a major victory in the recent anti-bureaucracy struggle in East China. This is a most powerful and profound ideological education for the Party organizations and all Party members in our Jiangsu Province, especially for leading organs and leading cadres at all levels. We fully support the wise decision of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee; and we are determined to learn from this incident to strengthen Party work and improve Party combat effectiveness.

Chairman Mao has long taught us that a significant mark that distinguishes Communists from any other political party is that they establish the closest ties with the broadest masses of the people, serve the people wholeheartedly, never deviate from the masses for a moment, proceed from the interests of the people in everything, rather than from the interests of their own small groups or individuals, and are ready at all times to uphold the truth and correct mistakes based on the opinions and interests of the masses. However, Huang Yifeng treated the people with the anti-people Kuomintang style. He not only did not listen to the people's opinions, but also adopted the method of suppression and attack to stifle criticism and stifle democracy. His only purpose in doing so was to be able to act arbitrarily in front of the masses and keep his "independent kingdom" inviolable. In this way, he placed himself in the position of the Party's mortal enemy and completely embarked on the anti-Party road. Therefore, the East China Bureau's expulsion of him from the Party was very necessary and entirely correct.

In the Jiangsu area, a small number of Party and non-Party cadres had wrong views on the Huang Yifeng incident, such as thinking that "this is making a mountain out of a molehill" and "making a typical example in the anti-bureaucracy trend." This kind of wrong view is very dangerous. They did not realize that Huang Yifeng suppressed democracy, used his power, adopted various illegal means to attack and retaliate against critics, and tried his best to deceive the organization and even resisted the inspection of higher Party organizations in order to achieve his despicable aims of individualism. He had completely lost the qualifications of a Communist Party member. This is not "making a mountain out of a molehill" but is appropriate and deserved, and of course it is not because of a "small matter." The reason for these wrong views is because they did not look at the problem from the Party's principles, Party discipline, Party's position, and the standards of a Communist Party member, but adopted an extremely vulgar and decadent liberal attitude. After studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the news and editorials on the Huang Yifeng incident, comrades who had some of the above-mentioned wrong views have been decreasing day by day, but the education on the Party's basic principles, Party Constitution, Party discipline and democracy, Party policies and resolutions must still be greatly strengthened. Party organizations at all levels must learn from this incident and improve their work.

Judging from the materials initially revealed in various parts of Jiangsu, bad phenomena such as suppressing criticism, suppressing democracy, falsely reporting achievements, and concealing mistakes are also quite serious in some departments and among some Party cadres. The phenomena of coercion, commandism, and violation of laws and regulations among grassroots organizations and grassroots cadres are even more serious. Like Xiong Tiyun, deputy commander of the Subei Huai River Management Headquarters and secretary of the Subei Huai River Management Party Group, he suppressed and attacked Yang Xuezhong for reporting to the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central Government about his violation of financial discipline, and dared to detain Yang Xuezhong's complaint letter to the higher-level Party committee; Yi Shunqing, manager of the Nanjing Petroleum Company, not only did not humbly accept the correct criticism of worker Wu Changjun, but arranged a struggle meeting to attack the critic, and even went so far as to infringe on human rights and detain the critic. As for the commandism of district and township cadres, it has occurred in almost every work, resulting in many good things being done badly. Crimes of violating laws and regulations have also occurred constantly in various places. The existence of these phenomena seriously endangers the interests of the masses and damages the connection between the Party and the government and the people. These situations urgently require the vigilance and great attention of our leading organs and leading cadres at all levels.

Our Party organization in Jiangsu Province grew up in battle. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, after a long period of revolutionary struggle, it has led the people of Jiangsu to win their liberation. After the liberation of the whole province, it led the people of Jiangsu to complete various social reforms and production recovery work, and achieved great results. However, since the Party organization has been in a war environment for a long time, there is a very serious shortcoming in the Party's work. As Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his report: "The wartime environment once made the Party's leadership methods have certain characteristics, which also produced major shortcomings in the work of Party organs and Party organizations. This shortcoming is primarily manifested in the fact that Party organs have weakened their attention to Party organizational work and ideological work, so that in many Party organizations, this work has become unattended to." Judging from the situation of Party organizations in our Jiangsu Province, more than 80% of our cadres and the vast majority of Party members are in grassroots organizations, but we pay the least attention to the ideological work and organizational work of grassroots organizations. The leading organs lack frequent ideological education and policy education for grassroots cadres, and lack serious and rigorous review and selection. However, the work tasks undertaken by grassroots organizations and cadres are very heavy. Therefore, many bad deeds of coercion, commandism, and violation of laws and regulations inevitably occur constantly. For example, in terms of Party organizational work, the attitude of bureaucracy and red tape is often adopted in the investigation and selection of cadres. Cadres are often selected only based on their resumes and certificates, and their political qualities and professional abilities are not seriously and comprehensively reviewed. Many grassroots organizations and grassroots cadres lack real in-depth understanding and review and rectification, and even after mistakes occur, they are unconditionally accommodated and understood, and a laissez-faire attitude is adopted. Precisely because of this, many bad deeds such as suppressing criticism, stifling democracy, deceiving superiors and deceiving subordinates, concealing mistakes, coercing orders, and violating laws and regulations have not been exposed and dealt with seriously in a timely manner. There are also many leading cadres who are satisfied with the deployment of tasks, do not help lower levels solve specific difficulties, do not check their implementation of tasks, and are intoxicated by the numbers completed by lower-level organizations, but do not ask how grassroots cadres complete these tasks, and whether there is any coercion or violation of laws and regulations in the completion of tasks, and even praise the "completion of tasks" by means of coercion. They cannot deal with bad people and bad things in a timely manner, and they rarely care about the suffering of the people. This kind of bureaucracy that is divorced from reality and divorced from the masses has led to many serious problems in our work.

In order to overcome the shortcomings and mistakes in our work, improve the style of leadership, and correctly implement the Party's policies, where should we start to strengthen our Party's work to improve the Party's combat effectiveness? I think we should start with the following three aspects:

First, the leading organs of the Party at all levels should strengthen the Party's political work and organizational work, and get rid of the quagmire of pragmatism. This requires concentrating efforts, unifying thinking, principles, and policies, unifying plans and work steps, strengthening the Party's organizational work and ideological work, facing the grassroots, facing the masses, investigating and researching, seeking truth from facts, and explaining policies and working methods repeatedly when assigning work tasks. We must strive to be in line with reality, and we must deeply organize inspection work and discover problems at any time. It is the key to improving the work of the entire Party and improving the initiative and enthusiasm of Party organizations and Party members to actively and resolutely fight against bad people and bad things that undermine the Party's policies and harm the interests of the Party and the people, and to strictly enforce Party discipline.

Secondly, the Party's leading organs must earnestly strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We must oppose the erroneous tendency of underestimating ideological work in Party organizations at all levels, and we cannot think that ideological work is only the responsibility of the propaganda department. The whole Party must always bear in mind what Malenkov said: "Ideological work is the Party's primary responsibility. Failure to pay attention to this work may cause irreparable damage to the interests of the Party and the country." We must always remember the famous saying: "Any weakening of the influence of socialist ideology is a strengthening of the influence of bourgeois ideology." We must systematically educate all Party members on the Party's basic principles, Party Constitution, Party discipline, Party policies, and Party work style, and must make all Party organizations and all Party members know that the Party must ensure the completion of various revolutionary tasks or administrative tasks through the active efforts of all Party members and the Party's mass work. The whole Party must always bear in mind: "The Party must not be an appendage of state organs, and the Party organization must not be an appendage of any administrative organ or administrative person in charge. It must educate, supervise, and manage all Party members according to the Party's principles, ensure that they are loyal and honest to the Party, abide by Party discipline and the resolutions of the Party Central Committee, respect the criticism of Party newspapers and the criticism of the masses, contact the masses instead of being divorced from the masses, and serve the masses instead of suppressing the masses." (People's Daily editorial: "Those who suppress criticism are the mortal enemies of the Party")

Thirdly, we must launch a movement to oppose bureaucracy, oppose commandism, and oppose violations of laws and regulations in the whole Party in a led and planned manner. Eliminate the style of coercion and command, carry out criticism and self-criticism, establish regular democratic life, and improve our work. Party and government leading organs above the county level should start with checking the letters from the people, combine them with the current work, conduct top-down inspections and bottom-up criticisms, and treat and handle cadres who have committed coercion and commandism and violations of laws and regulations differently. Those bad elements who have sneaked into the revolutionary organization and cadres with very bad work styles, who have repeatedly refused to be educated, and who seriously endanger the interests of the people, should be dealt with seriously in accordance with Party discipline and state laws. As for the majority who have committed mistakes of coercion and command due to not understanding working methods, or who have minor faults, we must resolutely implement the policy of education as the main focus, both to distinguish the boundary between what is definitely the style of coercion and command and what is not the style of coercion and command; We must also distinguish whether the mistakes are due to the leadership's unclear explanation of policies, assignment of work tasks, and working methods, and lack of education, or other reasons. In short, we should earnestly absorb past lessons and conduct this movement in a led manner after making full preparations. At the same time, we must implement the spirit of criticism and self-criticism in our work. We must act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions in "The Tasks for 1945": "Leading personnel at all levels have the responsibility to listen to others and implement two principles:
(1) Say all you know and say it without reservation; (2) Those who speak are not guilty, and those who hear should take warning. If there is no 'those who speak are not guilty,' and it is true, not false, it is impossible to receive the effect of 'say all you know and say it without reservation.'" And we must establish a system of regular democratic life. All Party members must humbly listen to the criticisms of the masses and improve our work based on the correct criticisms of the masses.

Only in this way can the leading organs of our Party at all levels overcome pragmatism, strengthen political and ideological leadership, earnestly improve the Party's ideological work, and greatly strengthen democratic life inside and outside the Party. Consolidate our revolutionary ranks, our revolutionary ranks will be more consolidated, the Party's combat effectiveness can be increased a hundredfold, and become an invincible force forever.

    吸取黄逸峰事件的教训  加强党的工作，提高党的战斗力
    中国共产党江苏省委员会第一书记　柯庆施
    反党分子黄逸峰的被开除出党，是最近华东地区开展反官僚主义斗争的一个重大胜利；这对我们江苏省的党组织和全体党员，尤其是对各级领导机关和领导干部来说，是一次最有力、最深刻的思想教育。我们完全拥护中共中央华东局的英明决定；并决心从这一事件中吸取教训，以加强党的工作，提高党的战斗力。
    毛主席早就教导我们：共产党人区别于其他任何政党的一个显著标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系，全心全意为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众，一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从自己的小集团或个人的利益出发，并随时随地准备根据群众的意见、群众的利益来坚持真理，修正错误。但是，黄逸峰却是以反人民的国民党作风来对待人民群众，他不仅不倾听人民的意见，而且对来自人民的意见，采取压制打击的办法，以窒息批评，扼杀民主。他这样做的目的只有一个，就是为了他能在群众面前作威作福，保持他的“独立王国”不受侵犯。这样，他就把自己放在党的死敌的地位，完完全全走到反党的道路上去了，因而华东局开除了他的党籍，则是十分必要的，也是完全正确的。
    在江苏地区也曾有少数党与非党的干部，发生过对黄逸峰事件的错误看法，如认为“这是小题大作”，“在反官僚主义的风头上，做做典型的”等等。这种错误的看法，是非常危险的。他们没有认识到，黄逸峰压制民主，利用职权，采用各种非法手段给批评者以打击和报复，并为了达到其个人主义的可耻目的，千方百计地欺骗组织以至抗拒上级党组织的检查。他已经完全丧失了共产党员的条件。这不是什么“小题大作”而是恰如其分，罪有应得，当然更不是因为一个什么“小事”了。产生这些错误看法的原因，是由于因为没有从党的原则、党的纪律、党的立场以及共产党员的标准来看问题，而是采取一种极端庸俗的腐朽的自由主义的态度来看问题的缘故。经过对苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件和有关黄逸峰事件的新闻和社论的学习，有以上一些错误看法的同志虽然已经一天天地减少了，但是党的基本原则，党章，党的纪律和民主，党的政策和决议的教育工作，仍然要极大地加强。各级党的组织都必须接受这一事件的教训而改进自己的工作。
    从江苏各地初步揭发的材料来看，打击批评，压制民主，虚报成绩，掩饰错误等恶劣现象，即在某些部门和某些党员干部，也是相当严重的，基层组织和基层干部中的强迫命令、违法乱纪的现象那就更加严重。像苏北治淮指挥部副指挥、苏北治淮分党组书记熊梯云那样的高级干部，他竟对杨学忠向中央水利部反映他违反财政纪律等情况，采取了压制与打击，并胆敢扣押杨学忠向上级党委的控诉书；南京市石油公司经理易顺清，则不仅不虚心接受工人吴常俊的正确批评，反而布置斗争会打击批评者，甚至发展到侵犯人权，关押批评者；至于区乡干部中的命令主义几乎在每一件工作中都发生过，结果，把许多好事办坏了。违法乱纪的罪行，在各地也曾不断地发生过，这些现象的存在，严重地危害了群众的利益，破坏了党和政府与人民群众的联系。这些情况亟应引起我们各级领导机关和领导干部的警惕和极大重视。
    我们江苏省的党组织是在战斗中生长起来的，在毛主席、党中央的正确领导之下，经过长期的革命斗争，已经领导了全江苏的人民争取了自己的解放；全省解放以后，又领导了全江苏的人民完成了各项社会改革和生产的恢复工作，获得了巨大的成绩。但是，由于党的组织长期处在战争环境中，因而党的工作就存在着一个极为严重的缺点，正如马林科夫同志报告中所指出的：“战时环境曾经使党的领导方法不得不具有某些特点，这也就在党机关与党组织的工作中产生了重大的缺点。这种缺点首先表现在下述事实上：党机构削弱了对党的组织工作与思想工作的注意，因此，在党的许多组织里，这种工作变得无人照顾了。”从我们江苏省党的组织的情况来看，我们有百分之八十以上的干部和绝大部分的党员是在基层组织中，可是我们对基层组织的思想工作和组织工作却注意得最差。领导机关对基层干部既缺乏经常的思想教育和政策教育，又缺乏认真的严肃的审查和挑选，而基层组织和干部所负担的工作任务，却又十分繁重，因此，很多强迫命令和违法乱纪的恶行，必然就不断发生了。又如对党的组织工作，在考察和挑选干部方面，也往往采取官僚主义和文牍主义的态度，往往只是根据干部的履历表和证件来挑选干部，而没有认真的全面的审查他们的政治品质和业务能力，许多基层组织和基层干部，缺乏真正的深入了解和审查整理，甚至发生错误以后，无原则地迁就和谅解，采取姑息的态度。正因为如此，很多压制批评，窒息民主，欺上压下，掩饰错误，强迫命令，违法乱纪等等的恶行，就没有得到及时的揭发和严肃的处理。还有许多领导干部，满足于任务的布置，不帮助下级解决具体困难，不检查他们执行任务的情况，陶醉于下级组织完成的数字，对于基层干部如何完成这些任务，以及在完成任务中有无强迫命令，违法乱纪则不加过问，甚至对于用强迫命令方式“完成任务”的反加以表扬。对于坏人坏事，不能及时处理，对人民群众的疾苦，很少关心。这种脱离实际，脱离群众的官僚主义，以致使我们工作中发生不少严重的问题。
    为了要克服我们工作中的缺点和错误，改进领导作风，正确地贯彻党的政策，从什么地方入手来加强我们党的工作，以提高党的战斗力呢？我认为现在就要从以下三方面开始做起：
    首先是要各级党的领导机关加强党的政治工作和组织工作，离开事务主义的泥潭。这就必须集中力量、统一思想、方针、政策、统一计划和工作步调，加强党的组织工作和思想工作，面向基层，面向群众，调查研究，实事求是，交代工作任务必须反复地讲明政策、交代工作方法，必须力求切合实际，并要深入地组织检查工作，随时发现问题。主动地、积极地与破坏党的政策、危害党和人民的利益的坏人坏事进行坚决的斗争，严肃党的纪律，这是提高整个党的工作、提高党组织与党员的积极性和主动性的关键。
    其次，是要党的领导机关认真地加强马克思列宁主义与毛泽东思想的学习，必须反对各级党组织中轻视思想工作的错误倾向，不能认为思想工作仅仅是宣传部门的事，全党必须时刻牢记马林科夫所说的：“思想工作是党的首要职责，不重视这种工作就可能给党和国家的利益造成无法弥补的损失。”我们必须时刻记住：“社会主义思想影响的任何削弱，都是资产阶级思想影响的增强”的名言。有系统地对全体党员进行党的基本原则，党章、党的纪律、党的政策和党的作风的教育，务必使所有的党组织和全体党员都知道：党必须通过全体党员的积极努力和党的群众工作，保证各项革命任务或行政任务的完成。全党必须时刻牢记：“党必须不是国家机关的附属品，党的组织必须不是任何一个行政机关和行政负责人的附属品，它必须对所有党员按党的原则进行教育、监督和管理，保证他们对党忠诚老实，遵守党的纪律和党中央的决议，尊重党报的批评和群众的批评，联系群众而不是脱离群众，为群众服务而不是压制群众。”（人民日报社论：“压制批评的人是党的死敌”）
    再次是要在全党有领导有计划地开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的运动。肃清强迫命令作风，开展批评与自我批评，建立经常的民主生活，改进我们的工作。县以上的党政领导机关，应该从检查人民来信入手，结合当前的工作，进行自上而下的检查和自下而上的批评，分别对待和处理各样犯有强迫命令、违法乱纪错误的干部。对待那些混进革命组织的坏分子和作风十分恶劣，屡教不改，严重危害人民群众利益的干部，应根据党纪和国法严肃处理。至于大多数因为不懂得工作方法犯有强迫命令错误，或者有轻微过失者均须坚决贯彻以教育为主的方针，既要分清何者确属强迫命令作风，何者不属强迫命令作风的界限；还要分清何者是由于领导上交代政策、交代工作任务、工作方法不明确，缺乏教育而来的错误，还是其他原因等。总之，均应认真地吸收过去教训，进行充分准备后，有领导地去开展这一运动。同时，在工作中要贯彻批评和自我批评的精神。必须遵照毛主席在“一九四五年的任务”中的指示办事：“各级领导人员，有责任听别人的话，实行两条原则：
    （一）知无不言，言无不尽；（二）言者无罪，闻者足戒。如果没有‘言者无罪’一条，并且是真的，不是假的，就不可能收到‘知无不言，言无不尽’的效果。”并且要建立起经常的民主生活的制度。全体党员必须虚心倾听群众的批评，根据群众的正确的批评改进我们的工作。
    只有这样，我们各级党的领导机关，才能克服事务主义，加强政治思想领导，才能认真地改善党的思想工作和极大地加强党内外的民主生活。巩固我们的革命队伍，我们的革命队伍更加巩固，党的战斗力就能得到百倍的提高，成为永远不可战胜的力量。
