The Northwest Region Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee Office

From December of last year to February of this year, the regions in the Northwest that decided to launch the Marriage Law implementation movement have successively carried out key pilot work. Based on the summary reports of fourteen pilot townships and partial materials from reports in Shaanxi and Xi'an, the marriage system in various places has undergone varying degrees of change since the promulgation of the Marriage Law. However, generally speaking, the phenomena of arranged, bought, and early marriages are still very common, and the prevailing atmosphere of beating and abusing women is also serious; grassroots cadres and the masses have many doubts about implementing the Marriage Law; cadres who have interfered with marriage freedom or violated the Marriage Law are afraid of being punished and dare not approach the work teams; generally, they do not dare to publicize the Marriage Law to the masses. The masses generally believe that the work teams are "divorce squads" and "are here to punish mothers-in-law and men," and therefore try their best to prevent daughters-in-law and daughters from attending meetings or approaching the work teams. Those who have engaged in arranged, bought, or early marriages or beaten women are even more panicked, fearing divorce, contract termination, separation, and return of bride price, and fearing legal punishment; honest people fear that they will not be able to find wives after bought marriages are prohibited; only bachelors and those who want a divorce are very happy and want the work teams to help them solve their problems.

In response to the above situation, the movement is generally carried out in three stages.

First stage: Train cadres, explain policies, understand the situation, dispel concerns, and stabilize people's hearts. After the work teams go to the countryside, they first explain their purpose to the village cadres and the masses, repeatedly explaining to the masses that the purpose of the movement is to achieve family democracy and harmony and unite production. At the same time, they focus their main energy on organizing and training grassroots cadres and propagandists and activists, organizing everyone to study and discuss in depth according to the spirit of relevant laws, decrees, and instructions, clarifying policies, understanding the local situation, and then organizing a strong propaganda team as the backbone for carrying out the movement. At an appropriate time, convene a township people's representative meeting to discuss and approve the plan for the whole township to carry out the movement.

Second stage: Conduct in-depth propaganda, organize the masses to study and discuss, and fully mobilize the masses. Cities generally use streets or household sections, and villages use natural villages or resident groups and production mutual aid teams as units, convene meetings that are convenient for the masses to attend, and cadres of the work teams or trained village cadres and propagandists make reports, and then organize the masses to discuss. The report meeting is best convened with men, women, old, and young together (but do not force the masses to participate) to facilitate a comprehensive explanation of policies. When organizing discussions, according to the masses' living and production habits and level of awareness, convene small discussion meetings for old men, mothers-in-law, young men, and women separately, focusing on typical prominent issues, enlightening everyone to discuss repeatedly, and unlocking "knots" through mutual help among the masses. Some individual visits should also be conducted in conjunction.

After the propaganda is launched, many people in the masses will inevitably make requests or appeals, some of which involve legal cases and should be handed over to the courts for handling. However, criminal cases involving abuse, maltreatment, or murder caused by marriage problems or that may lead to suicide or murder should be actively investigated and handled in coordination with judicial departments. General marriage problems or family disputes should be appropriately resolved and handled through mediation and education.

The third stage is the construction stage of the movement. The main tasks are to commend exemplary couples and exemplary families, formulate family unity and production covenants under the voluntary conditions of the masses, summarize experience, and deploy future work. The formulation of family covenants should be combined with the patriotic production plan, strictly preventing the tendency of cadres to handle everything and formalism. Except for families with prominent problems, which can formulate covenants separately, covenants can generally be formulated by resident groups or production mutual aid teams. Commending models should be based on the conditions of democracy and harmony, active production, and political progress; happy families with marriage autonomy are the direction for the masses to strive for in the future and should be particularly commended. When commending, widely solicit opinions from the masses, but do not use the method of comparing households or people to avoid affecting the unity of the masses.

Finally, it is necessary to help the township summarize experience well: formulate a plan for the whole township to implement the Marriage Law in the future, pass it at an enlarged township people's representative meeting or mass meeting, and transform the implementation of the Marriage Law into a regular task.

The above three stages must be closely combined and cannot be mechanically separated.

How to do a good job in propaganda and education? The basic requirements of propaganda and education work are to comprehensively and correctly explain the spirit of the Marriage Law, eliminate the one-sided understanding and erroneous views of the Marriage Law among cadres and the masses, draw a clear line between the old and new marriage systems, and on this basis, improve existing family relationships, enhance internal unity among the people, stop illegal acts of abusing and killing women, and lay a good foundation for further implementation of the Marriage Law in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct propaganda in accordance with the "Outline of Propaganda for Implementing the Marriage Law" of the Central Marriage Law Implementation Movement Committee, combined with the thinking of local cadres and the masses. Mechanically copying articles is wrong, and one-sidedly publicizing the content of a certain chapter or article or emphasizing a certain aspect of the truth is also wrong and dangerous. Some places only talk about "respecting the mother-in-law" and not "loving the daughter-in-law" to the mother-in-law, and only talk about "loving the daughter-in-law" and not "respecting the mother-in-law" to the daughter-in-law, which will instead arouse mutual suspicion among family members and should be corrected; when explaining the protection of illegitimate children, the masses should also be educated to automatically correct certain chaotic sexual behaviors; when publicizing freedom of marriage and freedom of divorce, the masses should also be educated not to marry or divorce rashly and not to be snobbish. When publicizing, use the method of comparing the new and the old, combined with examples familiar to the local masses, especially examples of exemplary couples and harmonious families that have positive significance to illustrate the benefits of the Marriage Law; when talking about bad examples, try to avoid involving specific figures at that time and place. When commending models and formulating covenants, it is necessary to point out to the masses the specific ways to improve family relationships in the future and lay the foundation for the masses to consciously implement the Marriage Law in the future.

It is necessary to make good use of various opportunities and forces and adopt all methods that the local masses like to see and hear to carry out propaganda, but it must be carried out in an organized and led manner to prevent laissez-faire.

Correctly and properly handling problems among the masses is of great importance to improving the understanding of the masses. We should first focus on and be prepared to properly resolve several disputes that the masses request help in resolving, so that the masses can improve their understanding and gain their trust. Mediation work should be carried out through the masses or mediation groups and advanced elements in the countryside, and attention must be paid to improving the understanding of the parties involved during mediation, and they should put forward their own solutions, with cadres mediating in the middle. It must be explained patiently that the important thing is unity in the future, and old debts should not be turned over if they can be avoided.

When dealing with problems among the masses, it is necessary to distinguish the nature of the problems and draw a clear line on the policy boundaries for handling these problems. On the one hand, for extremely few serious criminal cases, such as cases of homicide and personal injury, we should actively investigate and understand them, put forward opinions, and hand them over to the courts for trial in accordance with the law, giving the criminals the legal sanctions they deserve to stop the continued occurrence of such crimes. When the masses make complaints or reports, they should be promptly sent to the court for investigation and handling without delay. It is wrong to adopt an attitude of not handling cases without complaints, not rescuing people in danger, and not asking questions after death for such cases. On the other hand, for general disharmony between husband and wife and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, as well as ordinary civil matters such as divorce, contract termination, property disputes, early marriage, bigamy, and improper relationships between men and women, the work team will only help solve them when the parties concerned make requests or complaints; if the parties concerned do not make requests, we should not take the initiative to meddle and deal with them, otherwise it will cause dissatisfaction among the masses.

Several issues concerning leadership:

(1) Conscientiously check the leadership strength and cadre conditions at all levels. Leaders at all levels must have capable personnel responsible for this work, and each township must have one or two backbone cadres who can grasp the policies. In areas with more problems and weaker strength, capable cadres must be added. Regions that are not adequately prepared may postpone their plans.

(2) Continue to check and clarify certain unhealthy emotions and incorrect views among cadres, such as the impatient mood of thinking that "there is no point without struggle" and hoping to "first seize some serious illegal events to open up the situation," as well as the phenomenon of blurred understanding of the policies and purposes of the movement and being afraid to take active responsibility, which should be overcome and corrected as soon as possible.

(3) In areas where the movement has begun or is about to begin, considerable fluctuations will generally be caused among cadres and the masses, and bad elements will also take the opportunity to spread rumors and provoke trouble. It is necessary to use all propaganda forces to quickly carry out correct propaganda and explanations in areas where fluctuations occur, eliminate the concerns of the masses, and stabilize the emotions of the masses. For cadres who are sent down and who have made mistakes in propaganda due to poor study and unclear policies, causing adverse effects, they should be promptly recalled, continue to be educated, and then sent to other areas to participate in this work, and should not be allowed to fend for themselves.

(4) Spring plowing has already begun, and all localities must take spring plowing as the center, help the lower-level cadres to properly arrange their work, and closely combine the implementation of the Marriage Law movement with spring production work, and must never delay or hinder the production of the masses. Movements should not be carried out in areas with disasters.

    西北区贯彻婚姻法重点试办工作的经验
    西北区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室
    自去年十二月到今年二月，西北区决定开展贯彻婚姻法运动的地区，都先后进行了重点试办工作。根据十四个试办乡的总结报告和陕西、西安市汇报中的部分材料，在婚姻法颁布以后，婚姻制度在各地发生了程度不同的变化。但总的说来，包办、买卖、早婚的现象仍很普遍，打骂虐待妇女的风气也很严重；基层干部和群众对贯彻婚姻法有不少疑虑；有过干涉婚姻自由或违反婚姻法行为的干部，害怕受处分，不敢和工作组接近；一般是不敢向群众宣传婚姻法。群众普遍认为工作组是“离婚队”，“是来整婆婆和男人的”，因而竭力阻止媳妇、女儿参加会议或接近工作组。有包办、买卖、早婚或打骂妇女行为的更是恐慌，害怕离婚、解约、分居、退采礼，害怕法办；老实人怕不准买卖婚姻后找不到老婆；只有光棍汉和想离婚的人很高兴，想让工作组帮助他们解决问题。
    针对上述情况，运动大体分三个阶段进行。
    第一阶段：训练干部，交代政策，摸清情况，解除顾虑，安定人心。工作组下乡后，首先向乡村干部和群众说明来意，反复向群众说明运动的目的是为了达到家庭民主和睦，团结生产。同时把主要精力放在组织与训练基层干部及宣传员、积极分子的工作上，根据有关法令、指示的精神，组织大家深入学习讨论，弄清政策，摸清当地情况，然后组织有力的宣传队伍，作为开展运动的骨干。在适当时间，召开一次乡人民代表会议，讨论通过全乡开展运动的计划。
    第二阶段：深入宣传，组织群众学习讨论，全面发动群众。城市一般以街道或户口段、乡村以自然村或居民小组、生产互助组为单位，召集群众便于参加的会议，由工作组干部或经过训练的乡村干部、宣传员作报告，然后组织群众讨论。报告会最好男女老少一齐召集（但不强迫群众参加），以利于全面交代政策。组织讨论时，可按照群众生活、生产习惯和觉悟程度，分别召开一些老汉、婆婆、青年男、女等小型座谈会，针对各种类型的带普遍性的突出问题，有重点地启发大家反复讨论，通过群众的互相帮助，解开“疙瘩”。同时也应结合进行一些个别访问。
    宣传展开之后，群众中必然有很多人提出要求或申诉，其中部分涉及法律的案件，应交法院办理。但关于婚姻问题引起的虐待、虐杀或可能发生自杀、被杀的刑事案件，应主动检查，并协同司法部门处理。一般的婚姻问题或家庭纠纷，通过调解教育，适当地加以解决处理。
    第三阶段是运动的建设阶段。主要工作是表扬模范夫妻和模范家庭，在群众自愿的条件下订立家庭团结生产公约，总结经验并布置今后工作。订立家庭公约应结合爱国生产计划来订立，严格防止干部包办代替和形式主义的偏向。除有突出问题的家庭，可单独订立公约外，一般可以居民小组或生产互助组为单位订立。表扬模范，应该以民主和睦、生产积极、政治进步为条件；婚姻自主的幸福家庭更是今后群众努力的方向，应特别加以表扬。表扬时要广泛吸收群众意见，但不要用户比户、人比人的方法进行，免得影响群众团结。
    最后要很好地帮助乡总结经验：订出今后全乡贯彻婚姻法的计划，在扩大的乡人民代表会议或群众大会上通过，把贯彻婚姻法转为经常工作。
    以上三个阶段必须密切结合，不能机械分开。
    怎样做好宣传教育工作呢？宣传教育工作的基本要求，是全面地正确地讲清婚姻法精神，消除干部和群众中对婚姻法的片面了解和错误看法，划清新旧婚姻制度的界限，并在此基础之上，改善现有的家庭关系，增进人民内部团结，制止虐杀、伤害妇女的犯法行为，给今后进一步贯彻婚姻法打下良好基础。因此，必须按照中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会“贯彻婚姻法宣传提纲”，结合当地干部和群众的思想进行宣传。机械地搬弄条文是不对的，片面地宣传某一章、某一条的内容或强调某一方面的道理也是错误的、危险的。有些地方对婆婆专讲“尊婆”不讲“爱媳”，对媳妇专讲“爱媳”不讲“尊婆”，这样反会引起家庭成员间的互相猜疑，应该纠正；解释保护非婚生子女时，应该同时教育群众自动纠正某些性乱行为；宣传结婚自由与离婚自由时，应该同时教育群众不要轻率结婚，轻率离婚，嫌贫爱富。宣传时要用新旧对比的方法，结合当地群众所熟习的事例，特别是模范夫妻、和睦家庭等有积极意义的事例来说明婚姻法的好处；讲坏的事例时，应尽量避免牵涉到当时当地的具体人物。在表扬模范，订立公约时，要给群众指出今后如何改善家庭关系的具体道路，为今后群众自觉地贯彻婚姻法打下基础。
    要善于利用各种机会和力量，采用当地群众喜闻乐见的一切方式进行宣传，但必须有组织、有领导地去进行，防止放任自流。
    正确妥善地处理群众中的问题，对提高群众认识的关系很大。应该首先有重点、有准备地妥善解决几件群众要求帮助解决的纠纷，使群众认识提高，并取得他们的信任。调解工作应该通过群众或农村中的调解小组和先进分子进行，调解时必须注意提高当事人的认识，由他们自己提出解决意见，干部居中调处。必须耐心说明，重要的是今后团结，老旧账能够不翻的就不要翻。
    处理群众中的问题，必须分别问题的性质，划清处理这些问题的政策界限。一方面，对于极少数严重犯法的刑事案件，如杀害人命、伤害人身的案件，应主动调查了解，提出意见，交法院依法审判，予罪犯以应得的法律制裁，以制止此种犯罪行为的继续发生。群众提出申诉或告发时，更应及时送交法院查明办理，不要拖延。对于这种案件，采取不告不理，见危不救，死了不问的态度是不对的。另一方面，对于一般夫妻婆媳不和，以及离婚、解约、财产纠纷、早婚、重婚、不正当的男女关系等普通民事问题，只有在当事人提出要求或申诉时，工作组才帮助解决；当事人不提出，我们就不应该主动地多事地去检查和处理，否则会引起群众不满。
        有关领导的几个问题：
        （一）切实检查各级领导力量和干部条件，各级领导必须有能力较强的专人负责此一工作，每一个乡必须有能够掌握政策的一两个骨干干部。问题较多、力量较弱的地方，一定要加配得力干部。准备不够的地区，宁可推迟一步。
        （二）继续检查并澄清干部中某些不健康的情绪和不正确的看法。如认为“不斗争就没意思”，希望“下去首先抓住一些严重犯法事件来轰开局面”等急躁情绪，以及对运动的政策和目的认识模糊，不敢积极负责的束手束脚现象，都应及早加以克服和纠正。
        （三）在运动开始或将要开始的地区，干部和群众中一般会引起相当的波动，还会有坏分子从中造谣挑拨，必须运用一切宣传力量，在发生波动的地区，迅速进行正确的宣传解释，消除群众顾虑，把群众情绪安定下来。对于派下去的干部如有因学习不好，不明政策，因而宣传错误、造成不良影响的，要及时调回，继续教育后再派往其他地区参加这一工作，不要任其自流。
        （四）春耕已经开始，各地必须以春耕为中心，帮助下边干部妥善安排工作，把贯彻婚姻法运动和春季生产工作密切结合起来，绝不许耽误或妨碍群众生产。有灾荒的地区，不搞运动。
