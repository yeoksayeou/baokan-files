Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 1st: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Pyongyang Anti-Epidemic Committee recently held an enlarged meeting. In accordance with the decisions and orders of the Republic's Cabinet and Military Committee, the structure of the Anti-Epidemic Committee was reorganized, and it was decided to further strengthen the mobility and speed of anti-epidemic work in preparation for timely crushing of the germ warfare being waged by the US aggressors. The meeting formulated a plan for sanitation and anti-epidemic work for the spring and summer of 1953, stipulating the further reorganization and strengthening of the anti-epidemic network composed of sanitary outposts, disease inspection teams, and mobile anti-epidemic teams. The meeting decided to begin administering preventative inoculations against infectious diseases to all residents after the end of the spring vaccination campaign, and also decided to hold a major clean-up week to thoroughly improve environmental sanitation.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 1st: People from all walks of life in Korea have expressed boundless indignation at the US imperialists' cowardly behavior in continuing to deny their germ warfare crimes in the face of new evidence.

Korean bacteriologist Hyun Byung-geun said: "US imperialism has been using all kinds of deceptive means in an attempt to conceal its monstrous crime of conducting germ warfare. It is especially ridiculous that former US Commander-in-Chief Ridgway, who personally ordered the germ warfare under the instructions of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, even pretended to say that he could swear before God. But the facts cannot be covered up. The confessions of US prisoners such as Scheib and the results of our meticulous examinations have once again thoroughly confirmed the enemy's crime. In the face of conclusive evidence, US imperialism's continued denial is worthless. It can only arouse stronger anger and opposition from the people of the world."

Dr. Cha Kwan-sun of a certain hospital said: "From the Korean War, the Korean people and the people of the world have further recognized the ferocious face of US imperialism, which uses science to slaughter tens of thousands of civilians, and its shameless tricks of denying its crimes in every possible way. We must fight this shameless enemy of mankind to the end. The people of the world will resolutely impose severe sanctions on the wicked enemy."

Park Jong-ho, a teacher at a certain junior middle school, also denounced the enemy's shameless act of continuing to play tricks in the face of facts. He said: "In order to safeguard international conventions and human morality, we resolutely demand that the US imperialists' germ warfare be stopped, and demand that the vicious and shameless American war criminals be severely punished in the name of all mankind."

    平壤市加强防疫卫生工作粉碎美国细菌战
    朝鲜各界人民痛斥美国抵赖细菌战罪行
    【新华社平壤一日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社消息：平壤市防疫委员会最近召开扩大会议，按照共和国内阁与军事委员会的决定和命令，将防疫委员会的机构加以改组，并决定在防疫工作中进一步加强机动性和迅速性，准备及时粉碎美国侵略者进行的细菌战。会议制定了一九五三年春夏两季的卫生防疫工作计划，规定进一步改编和加强由卫生哨、检病班和机动防疫队所构成的防疫网。会议决定，在结束春季种痘工作后，开始给全体居民进行传染病预防注射；并决定举行大扫除清洁周，彻底整理环境卫生。
    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜各界人民对于美帝国主义者在新的证据面前继续抵赖它进行细菌战的卑怯行为，表示无比的愤恨。
    朝鲜的细菌学家玄炳根说：美帝国主义一直在使用种种欺骗手段，企图掩饰它进行细菌战的滔天罪行。尤其可笑的是，在美国参谋长联席会议的指示下、亲自下令进行细菌战的前侵朝美军总司令李奇微，还曾经装模装样地说什么可以在上帝面前赌咒。但是事实是掩盖不了的，美俘许威布尔等的供词和我们进行精密检验的结果，都已再一次彻底地证实了敌人的这个罪行。在确凿的罪证面前，美帝国主义的继续抵赖是一文不值的。它只能激起世界人民更强烈的愤怒和反对。
    某医院医师车官善说：朝鲜人民和全世界人民从朝鲜战争中已进一步认识了利用科学来屠杀成千成万平民的美帝国主义的凶恶面目和它百般抵赖自己所犯罪行的无耻伎俩。我们一定要和这个不要脸的人类死敌搏斗到底。全世界人民必将坚决地给万恶的敌人以严厉的制裁。
    某初级中学教员朴钟浩也痛斥敌人在事实面前继续耍赖的无耻行径。他说：为了维护国际公约和人类道德，我们坚决要求制止美帝国主义的细菌战，并要求以全人类的名义严惩凶恶无耻的美国战犯。
