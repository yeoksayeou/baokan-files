    Saves the Country a Great Deal of Wealth by Using Chinese Toon Hemp Rope Instead of Iron Straps for Cotton Bales
    Hubei Province State-owned Trading Company salesman Li Wansong successfully experimented with using Chinese toon hemp rope to replace iron straps for cotton bales, saving the country a great deal of wealth. He was awarded the honorary title of First-Class Model Worker of the Hubei Province State-owned Trading System. This new creation has now been promoted in Shashi, Hubei, Luoyang, Henan, and other places.
    Chinese toon hemp is a slow-selling native product of Hubei Province. Since 1952, more than six million jin have been produced, but they could not be sold, while the iron straps used for cotton bales needed to be imported from capitalist countries. Last winter, the Hubei Province State-owned Trading System launched a production increase and economy drive. Li Wansong actively tried to find a market for Chinese toon hemp. He traveled for more than a month, but still could not find a market for Chinese toon hemp. However, Li Wansong did not lose heart. He finally came up with the idea of processing Chinese toon hemp into rope to replace iron straps for cotton bales. In order to test the performance of the hemp rope, the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Central South District Company dropped cotton bales tied with Chinese toon hemp rope from the third floor. As a result, the cotton bales were still intact, and the hemp rope tying the cotton bales did not break. Later, the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Central South District Company transported these cotton bales from Wuhan to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Jiujiang, and other places. After long-distance allocation, the cotton bales tied with Chinese toon hemp rope were still as strong as those tied with iron straps.

    湖北贸易公司业务员李万松
    用椿麻绳代铁皮打棉花包为国家节省了大量财富
    湖北省国营贸易公司业务员李万松，试验用椿麻绳代替铁皮打棉花包成功，为国家节省了大量的财富，因此他荣获了湖北省国营贸易系统一等工作模范的光荣称号。这一新创造现已在湖北的沙市、河南的洛阳等地推广。
    椿麻是湖北省一种滞销的土产品，一九五二年以来，共生产了六百多万斤，无法推销，而打棉花包用的铁皮却需要从资本主义国家进口。去年冬季，湖北省国营贸易系统开展了增产节约运动，李万松就积极想办法为椿麻找销路，他奔走了一个多月，还是不能给椿麻找到销路。但是李万松并没有灰心，他终于想出了用椿麻加工成绳代替铁皮打棉花包的办法。为了考验麻绳的性能，中国花纱布公司中南区公司曾把椿麻绳打成的棉花包从三层楼上丢下来，结果棉花包还是好好的，打棉花包的麻绳并没有折断。以后，中国花纱布公司中南区公司又把这些棉花包从武汉运到上海、广州、重庆、九江等地，经过长距离的调拨，椿麻绳打成的棉花包仍然和铁皮打成的棉花包一样坚固。
