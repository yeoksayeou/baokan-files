    How We Corrected Formalistic Practices in Promoting the Zhaoyuan High-Yield Experience
    Qiu Jian, Secretary of the CCP Hailun County Committee

    Editor's Note: Before mid-January, leading cadres in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, committed a serious error of formalism in promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience (see the report on page 2 of this newspaper on February 12). They recognized this error, conscientiously studied, adopted the leadership methods of the Zhaoyuan County Committee, and promoted the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, which began to yield practical results. There are still many counties that are promoting advanced experiences using formalistic methods. They should correct their mistakes quickly like the Hailun County Committee.

    Our county's work in promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience did indeed commit the error of formalism. Before mid-January, although we held some meetings on this issue and made multiple arrangements among county, district, and village cadres, and also organized study sessions to learn from the pamphlets on the Zhaoyuan experience, and trained more than 400 peasant technicians, there was no actual action. What was the reason? It was still because our leadership's thinking was not correct. I thought: Although the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience is also important, it is a technical guidance work, and it can be handled by the Agricultural Section of the County People's Government. Under the control of this idea, although I read and studied the documents, I did not go deep, and I did not carefully study them in connection with the specific conditions of the county. Later, when I saw that there were many reports on this work in the newspapers, and the "wind was blowing stronger and stronger," we began to pay more "attention" to it. However, the problem in our thinking was not truly solved. We did not deeply understand that the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience is an important method for changing leadership style and fully leveraging agricultural potential. Therefore, although we paid more "attention" than before, we still didn't use our brains much to come up with effective measures to change the formalistic approach. Later, when I went down to Yuquan Village, I calculated the detailed account of promoting the Zhaoyuan experience. Based on Hailun's farming conditions, if the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience was promoted on 60,000 hectares of land, 1,717,120 *shi* of grain could be produced. That is to say, only 33.4 percent of the county's total land area of 260,000 hectares is needed to complete 57.2 percent of the county's total agricultural production goal for 1953 (3 million *shi* of grain). In this way, we realized more clearly the importance of promoting the Zhaoyuan experience. But as far as the whole county is concerned, it is still "hemiplegic." Although the upper level kept "arranging," the lower level remained "steady as a rock." The root cause lies in our leadership work being generalized and not specific; especially myself, I did not go deep into the grassroots to set an example and promote it. Therefore, we went to two villages to carry out key experimental work separately. The problems encountered in the exploration of these two villages were similar. When talking about the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, the masses were very happy to listen, but when it came to making plans to implement it, they were not very active. Many people had ideological concerns. We adopted the method of Zhaoyuan to promote advanced experience, and repeatedly and patiently explained the principle of increasing production, calculated detailed accounts, measured row spacing, checked stubble, and weighed ears, which resolved many people's doubts. In Shuangquan Village, combining it with the summary of the high-yield experience of Wang Fushan and others in the village played a decisive role in promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience. After doing this, we convened a county-wide meeting of labor models and mutual aid and cooperation representatives, and concentrated our efforts at the meeting to solve two problems: First, to follow the new path of getting organized; second, to deeply and practically implement the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience. This meeting corrected the formalistic approach of general appeals during past meetings. Based on the principles and spirit of the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, combined with the actual situation of the county, we compared the old and new farming methods and the actual examples of producing more or less grain. While explaining, we drew ridges and seedlings on the blackboard, calculated accounts, and also displayed specimens for everyone to see. The representatives were very enthusiastic about listening. But when it came to the group discussion about how to mobilize the masses to do a good job in making plans, some representatives raised difficulties. For example, Hou Lin, a labor model from the twelfth district, said: "The Zhaoyuan high-yield experience is good, but women cannot be mobilized. In this case, another meeting was held to introduce the key experimental situation of Shuangquan Village and Yuquan Village. The introduction focused on what ideological obstacles and practical problems were encountered and how to solve them, and introduced how to make plans and what role the combination of summarizing the village's high-yield experience played. The representatives solved many problems after listening, but the roots of conservative thinking still existed. In order to solve this problem, on the third day of the conference, the representatives were divided into six teams, each team with one to two technical instructors, to conduct internships in the fields to check stubble, measure row spacing, and find the causes of reduced production. In the internship of looking at grain stubble, the representatives all agreed that: Listening to lectures alone is not enough. Hearing about it for a day is not as good as seeing it in the field once. Xin Shiwen from Nanlun Village, Eleventh District, said: After going to the field to look and calculate, it is exactly the same as what was said. I guarantee that I will mobilize women when I go back and do a good job in thinning seedlings. In order to make the representatives more clearly understand the practice of promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, we organized everyone to visit Shuangquan Village, where we had done key experimental work. The village cadres introduced the process of the masses in Shuangquan Village from disbelief to belief, from making plans to taking action. After the visit, the representatives had even greater enthusiasm for promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience.

    In order to universally and deeply promote the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience and make it a truly mass movement, it is necessary to continue to do many specific tasks. We have already drawn 92 people from the county committee of the Communist Party of China, the county government and other departments to form a working team for promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience. They are divided into eight large groups, and the 16 rural districts in the county are divided into eight areas. Each area will have a group to specifically help district and village cadres mobilize the masses to implement the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience and rectify mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

    We are also actively preparing for the agricultural tools, commercial fertilizers, etc. required for the implementation of the new farming methods, and will prepare them within the prescribed date and deliver them all to the masses.

    我们怎样纠正了推广肇源丰产经验中的形式主义作风
    中共海伦县委书记　邱健
    编者按：一月中旬以前，黑龙江省海伦县领导干部在推广肇源丰产经验的过程中，犯了严重的形式主义的毛病（见本报二月十二日第二版的报道）。他们认识了这种毛病，认真进行了学习，采取肇源县委的领导方法，推广肇源丰产经验，开始收到了实效。现在有不少县份，仍然用形式主义的方法推广先进经验。他们应当像海伦县委这样迅速改正错误。
    我县推广肇源丰产经验的工作，确实是犯了形式主义的毛病。一月中旬前虽然也为这个问题开了一些会，在县区村干部中也进行过多次布置，还专门组织过学习会学习肇源经验的小册子，也训练过四百多名农民技术员，但是却没有实际行动。原因在那里？还是因为我们领导方面的思想不对头。我认为：肇源丰产经验虽也重要，但这是个技术指导工作，由县人民政府农业科负责就行了。在这个思想支配下，我对文件虽然也看了，学了，但不深入，更没有联系本县具体情况去细致地研究。后来看到报纸上对这个工作报道得不少，“风越刮越大”，我们才开始比较“重视”它了。可是，思想上的问题并没有真正解决。我们对于肇源丰产经验是改变领导作风和充分发挥农业潜在力的重要方法认识不深。因此，虽比前些日子“重视”了，但仍然没去多用脑子，想出有效措施来改变形式主义的作法。后来下乡到玉泉村，算了一下推广肇源经验的细帐，根据海伦的耕作情况，如果在六万垧土地上推广了肇源丰产经验，就可以打一百七十一万七千一百二十石粮食。这就是说，只用全县土地总面积二十六万垧土地的百分之三十三点四，就可以完成一九五三年全县农业生产总奋斗目标（三百万石粮的百分之五十七点二。这样，我们才把推广肇源经验的重要看得比较清楚了。但就全县来讲，仍是“半身不遂”，上边虽然不住地“布置”，下边却“稳风不动”。病根就在于我们的领导工作一般化，不具体；特别是我，没有深入下层，作出样子，加以推广。于是，我们就分头到两个村作了重点试验工作。在这两个村的摸索中所遇到的问题大同小异。讲肇源丰产经验的时候，群众听了都很高兴，一提到作计划实行，都不很积极。很多人都有思想顾虑。我们采用了肇源推广先进经验的方法，反复耐心地讲解增产的道理，算细账，量弓口，查楂子，称穗头，解除了许多人的疑问。在双泉村结合了总结本村王富山等人的丰产经验，使推广肇源丰产经验起了决定性的作用。这样做了之后，我们又召开了全县劳动模范和互助合作代表会议，在会上集中力量解决了两个问题：一是走好组织起来的新道路；二是深刻实际地贯彻肇源丰产经验。这次会议上改正了过去开会时一般化号召的形式主义作风，根据肇源丰产经验的原则精神结合了本县实际情况，进行了新旧耕作法的对比和多打粮少打粮的实际例子的对比。在讲的时候在黑板上画垅，画苗，算账，还摆出标本给大家看，代表们听的情绪很高。但到了小组讨论回去如何发动群众搞好订计划的时候，就有些代表提出了困难。如十二区的劳动模范侯林说：“肇源丰产经验好是好，就是妇女发动不起来。在这种情况下，又开大会把双泉村、玉泉村两个村重点试验情况作了介绍。介绍中着重介绍遇到了一些什么思想障碍和实际问题以及怎样解决的办法，并介绍了如何作计划和结合总结本村丰产经验起了什么作用。代表们听后解决了不少问题，可是保守思想根子仍然存在。为了解决这个问题，大会第三天又把代表分成六个队，每队有一名至两名技术讲解员，到大地进行查楂子、量弓口、找减产原因的实习。在实习看谷楂中，代表们都一致说：这光听讲是不行，讲一天不如到地看一遍。十一区南伦村的辛士文说：到地里一看一算，和讲的真一点不差。我保证回去一定把妇女动员起来，作好间苗工作。为了使代表们更清楚地了解推广肇源丰产经验的做法，我们又组织大家去我们做过重点试验工作的双泉村参观。村干部介绍了双泉村群众由不相信到相信，由定计划到行动起来的过程。参观之后，代表们推广肇源丰产经验的劲头更大了。
    为了普遍深入地把肇源丰产经验推广下去，使它成为真正的群众性的运动，还要继续不断做许多具体的工作。我们已经从中共县委员会、县政府等部门抽出九十二人组成推广肇源丰产经验的工作队，共划分了八个大组，把全县十六个农村区、共划成了八个片，每片去一个组，具体帮助区村干部发动群众推行肇源丰产经验，并整顿互助合作组织。
    对于实行新耕作法所需要的农具、商品肥料等等，我们也正积极进行准备，将在规定的日期内准备好，并且全部送到群众手里。
