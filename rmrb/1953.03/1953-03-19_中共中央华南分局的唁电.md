To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia:

    We were filled with infinite sorrow upon hearing the news of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Klement Gottwald, the respected leader of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak people! On behalf of the Communists and the people of the entire South China region, we extend our deepest condolences and sympathies to you.

    Comrade Gottwald was an outstanding leader of the Czechoslovak workers' movement and an indomitable fighter for the cause of world peace. The passing of Comrade Gottwald is not only a great loss for the Czechoslovak people, but also a significant loss for the Chinese people and the world peace camp.

    We firmly believe that the Communist Party members and the people of Czechoslovakia will unite around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and fight to realize Comrade Gottwald's legacy. We, the Communist Party members and the people of South China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, will further strengthen the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples, unite even more closely in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, increase our vigilance a hundredfold, strike at the warmongers, and fight to the end to defend world peace and for the cause of communism.

    Eternal glory to Comrade Gottwald!

                The South China Sub-Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
