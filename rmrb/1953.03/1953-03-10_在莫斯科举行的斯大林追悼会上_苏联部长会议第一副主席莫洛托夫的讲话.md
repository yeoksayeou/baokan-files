Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th (TASS):

Comrades, friends!

These days, we all feel deep sorrow due to the death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the loss of the great leader, the loss of a close and infinitely beloved relative. We, his close old friends and millions of Soviet people, as well as the working people of all countries, are today bidding farewell to Comrade Stalin, whom we all loved so much, and who will live forever in our hearts.

Comrade Stalin called himself a student of Lenin, and together with Lenin he founded and built our great Communist Party; together with Lenin, he led the people in the revolutionary struggle against the rule of the Tsar and capitalism, overthrowing the oppression of landlords and capitalists in our country; together with Lenin, he founded and built our Soviet socialist state; together with Lenin, he laid the foundation for the brotherly cooperation and unity between the large and small nationalities that we have seen constantly growing. Stalin was the great successor to the great cause of Lenin.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people built socialism in our country; began to realize the great program of constantly improving the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people; achieved a victory of world-historical significance over fascism in the Second World War, thereby greatly weakening the forces of the enemies of the Soviet Union abroad; ensured the establishment of an invincible camp of peace-loving countries with a population of 800 million, freeing the Soviet Union from international isolation; and opened up a bright prospect for our country to build a communist society based on free labor and genuine equality, friendship and love between people.

We have good reason to be proud that we have lived and worked under the leadership of Comrade Stalin for thirty years. We were educated by Lenin and Stalin, we are students of Lenin and Stalin, and we will always remember the teachings Stalin gave us during his lifetime, because we must be good and loyal students and successors of Lenin, and we must be good and loyal students and successors of Stalin.

Comrade Stalin's life was illuminated by the brilliance of the great ideas of a people's warrior who actively fought for communism, and his life is a living example for us.

Stalin came from the people, and he always had a flesh-and-blood connection with the people, with the working class, and the working peasants, and he dedicated all his vigorous strength and his great talent to the people. Even in his youth, Stalin saw with his brilliant wisdom and deeply understood that in our era, the people can only find the path to a happy life by fighting for communism. This determined his life path. Stalin unreservedly dedicated his entire life to fighting for communism, and to conducting selfless struggle for the happiness of the working people, and for the happiness of the people.

Stalin always skillfully combined the arduous daily activities of communists and revolutionaries among the working masses with the profound study of Marxist theory.

He was like this in his youth, when he worked in Tbilisi and Baku. He was also like this during the turbulent period of the Russian revolution, during the difficult years under the rule of the Tsarist reactionaries, when he was often suppressed, persecuted in prisons and in exile, but he maintained close contact with the workers in St. Petersburg.

In the years of revolution and socialist construction, Comrade Stalin fully demonstrated his extraordinary talent as an unparalleled organizer of our party and the Soviet state, and as a genius Marxist-Leninist theorist.

During these years, our party grew and became stronger, became the great leading force of the socialist revolution in our country, and gained the significance of a leading force in the entire international workers' movement.

During these years, the multi-ethnic Soviet state has become a model for realizing the friendship and brotherly cooperation of all nationalities; during these years, our country, relying on the working class and the collective farmers, has been consolidated and become a victorious socialist country, embarking on the road of building a communist society. Comrade Stalin's leadership in all these undertakings, his leadership in the development of the strength of our party and the Soviet state, played a huge role.

During these years, Stalin not only conducted daily leadership of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, but also constantly studied the theoretical issues of building communism in our country and the issues of the entire international situation. He illuminated the path of further development of the Soviet Union with the brilliance of Marxist-Leninist science and expounded on the laws of socialist and capitalist development under modern conditions. He armed our party and all the Soviet people with the most important new discoveries of Marxist-Leninist science, which have illuminated our path to the victory of communism for many years.

During the years of the Civil War, Stalin directly led the work of establishing and organizing the Red Army, and commanded the glorious battles of the Red Army on the most decisive fronts. During the years of the Great Patriotic War, Stalin was the Supreme Commander, leading our country to victory over fascism, fundamentally changing the situation in Europe and Asia.

To be faithful and excellent successors of Stalin means to always remember and always care about strengthening the Soviet Union's army and navy, and to ensure that the Soviet armed forces are duly prepared in the event of an attack on our country by any aggressor. To be faithful and excellent successors of Stalin also means to show due vigilance and firmness in the struggle against all the conspiracies of our enemies, the lackeys of the imperialist aggressor countries.

Our Soviet state has no aggressive intentions whatsoever, nor does it interfere in the affairs of other countries. Our foreign policy is the world-renowned Stalinist policy of peace, a policy of defending international peace, a firm policy of maintaining and consolidating peace, and opposing the preparation and launching of new wars, a policy of international cooperation, and developing affairs with all countries that are also willing to develop affairs. This foreign policy is in line with the fundamental interests of the Soviet people, and also in line with the interests of all other peace-loving peoples.

In our country, on the basis of the Soviets, such a multi-ethnic country has been established, its solidity, the continuous growth of its material strength, and the improvement of the culture of its various ethnic groups are unprecedented. In all these aspects, especially in the development of new friendly relations between the nationalities of our country, Comrade Stalin played a special and very significant role. At the same time, for many years Stalin not only led the work of developing our multi-ethnic Soviet state, but also theoretically elaborated on the most important modern national and colonial issues, thereby promoting the development of Marxist-Leninist scientific principles in this regard.

Under the current circumstances, all this is of particular importance, which is even more important due to the establishment of people's democratic countries, and the increase in national liberation movements in colonies and dependencies. Faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalism, the Soviet people develop and continuously strengthen their brotherly friendship and cooperation with the great Chinese people, with the working people of various people's democratic countries, and develop and continuously strengthen friendly ties with the working people of capitalist and colonial countries who jointly fight for peace, democracy, and socialism.

Dear comrades, friends!

In these difficult days, we all clearly see and constantly feel how strong, solid, and reliable a pillar the Communist Party, its steel-like unity, and its inseparable connection with the working masses are for the Soviet people. Our party, following the great teachings of Stalin, points out to us the clear direction to continue to struggle for the great cause of building communism in our country. We must unite more closely and more firmly around the Central Committee of our Party, and the Soviet government.

Stalin's immortal name will live forever in our hearts, in the hearts of the Soviet people, and in the hearts of all progressive mankind.

Stalin's great cause for the benefit and happiness of our people and the working people of the world will be immortal!

Long live the great invincible doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin!

Long live our strong socialist motherland, our heroic Soviet people!

Long live the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union!

    在莫斯科举行的斯大林追悼会上
    苏联部长会议第一副主席莫洛托夫的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    这几天，由于约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林的逝世，由于失去了伟大的领袖，失去了亲近的无限亲爱的亲人，我们大家感到深沉的悲痛。我们，他的亲近的老朋友和千百万的苏维埃人民，以及世界各国的劳动人民，今天在和斯大林同志告别，我们大家是这样热爱他，他将永远活在我们心中。
    斯大林同志把自己叫做列宁的学生，他和列宁一起创立和建设了我们伟大的共产党；他和列宁一起，领导人民进行了反对沙皇统治和资本主义、推翻我国地主资本家的压迫的革命斗争；他和列宁一起创立和建设了我们的苏维埃社会主义国家；他和列宁一起奠定了我们亲眼看着它不断增长的大小民族间的兄弟般的合作和团结。斯大林是伟大的列宁事业的伟大继承者。
    苏联人民在以斯大林同志为首的共产党的领导下，在我国建设了社会主义；开始实现了不断增进苏联人民物质福利和文化水平的伟大纲领；在第二次世界大战中对法西斯主义取得了有世界历史意义的胜利，因而大大削弱了苏联国外敌人的力量；保证了拥有八亿人口的、爱好和平国家的不可战胜的阵营的建立，使苏联摆脱了国际上孤立的地位；替我国展开了建设以自由劳动和人与人之间真正平等友爱为基础的共产主义社会的光辉前景。
    我们很有理由可以自傲的，就是三十年来我们是在斯大林同志领导下生活和工作的。我们是列宁和斯大林教育出来的，我们是列宁和斯大林的学生，我们将永远记得斯大林生前给我们的教导，因为我们要做列宁的忠实的好学生和继承者，要做斯大林的忠实的好学生和继承者。
    斯大林同志的一生被积极为共产主义奋斗的人民战士的伟大思想的光辉所照耀，他的一生是我们活生生的榜样。
    斯大林来自人民，他始终同人民、和工人阶级、劳动农民有着血肉的联系，他把他的充沛的力量、他的伟大的天才全部贡献给了人民。斯大林还在青年时代，就用自己光辉的智慧看到并且深刻地了解到，在我们这个时代，人民只有为共产主义奋斗才能找到走向幸福生活的道路。这也就决定了他的生活道路。斯大林毫无保留地贡献出他的一生，为共产主义而奋斗，为劳动者的幸福、为人民的幸福而进行忘我的斗争。
    斯大林总是善于把共产党员、革命者在工人群众中的艰苦的日常活动，和马克思主义理论的深刻的研究结合起来。
    他在年青时代，在第比利斯、巴库工作的时候就是这样的。在俄国革命的动荡时期，在沙皇反动派统治下的艰苦年代，他也是这样的，那时他虽然经常受到镇压，在监狱里、在流放中受到迫害，可是他和彼得堡的工人保持着牢固的联系。
    在革命和社会主义建设的年代里，斯大林同志作为我们党和苏维埃国家无可比拟的组织者，作为马克思列宁主义天才的理论家，充分发挥了他的非凡天才。
    在这些年代里，我们的党成长起来，壮大起来，变成了我国社会主义革命的伟大的领导力量，并且在整个国际工人运动中有了领导力量的意义。
    在这些年代里，多民族的苏维埃国家已经成为实现各民族友好和兄弟合作的模范；在这些年代里，我们国家依靠工人阶级和集体农民，已经巩固起来，成为胜利了的社会主义国家，走上了建设共产主义社会的道路。斯大林同志对这一切事业的领导，对于发展我们党和苏维埃国家的力量的领导，起了巨大的作用。
    斯大林在这些年代里，不仅对苏联的社会主义建设进行日常的领导，而且经常研究在我国建设共产主义的理论问题，研究整个国际形势的问题，他以马克思列宁主义科学的光辉照亮了苏联进一步发展的道路，阐明了在现代条件下社会主义和资本主义发展的规律。他以马克思列宁主义科学的最重要的新发现武装了我们的党和全体苏联人民，这些发现多年来一直照耀着我们走向共产主义的胜利的道路。
    在内战的年代里，斯大林直接领导了建立和组织红军的工作，并且在最有决定意义的战线上指挥了红军的光荣战斗。在伟大卫国战争的年代里，斯大林是最高统帅，领导我国战胜了法西斯主义，从根本上改变了欧洲和亚洲的局势。
    要作斯大林的忠实的优秀的继承者，就是要永远记住并始终关心加强苏联的陆海军，保证在任何侵略者进攻我国的时候，苏联武装力量有应有的准备。要作斯大林的忠实的优秀的继承者，也就是要在和我们的敌人、帝国主义侵略国家的走狗的一切阴谋进行斗争的时候，表现出应有的警惕和坚定。
    我们苏维埃国家没有任何侵略的意图，它也不干涉别国的事务。我们的外交政策就是全世界知名的斯大林和平外交政策，这个政策是保卫国际和平的政策，是维护和巩固和平、反对准备和发动新战争的坚定政策，是国际合作、和所有也愿意发展事务联系的国家发展事务联系的政策。这种外交政策符合苏联人民的根本利益，同时也符合一切其他爱好和平的人民的利益。
    在我国，在苏维埃的基础上，已建立了这样一个多民族的国家，它的牢固，它的物质力量的不断增长和它的各族人民文化的提高，是史无先例的。在所有这些方面，首先在发展我国各民族间新的友好关系方面，斯大林同志起了特别的、非常重大的作用。同时，多年以来斯大林不仅领导了发展我们多民族苏维埃国家的工作，而且在理论上阐明了现代最重要的民族和殖民地问题，从而在这方面促进了马克思列宁主义科学原理的发展。
    在目前的情况下，这一切都有特别重要的意义，由于人民民主国家的建立，以及殖民地和附属国民族解放运动的增涨，这就更加重要。忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则的苏联人民发展并且不断加强同伟大中国人民、同各人民民主国家的劳动人民的兄弟友谊与合作，发展并不断加强共同为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的资本主义和殖民地国家劳动人民的友好联系。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    在这些困难的日子里，我们大家都特别清楚地看到，并且时时感觉到，我们的共产党、它的钢铁般的团结、它跟劳动群众的不可分的联系，是苏联人民多么强大坚固的可靠支柱。我们的党遵循着伟大的斯大林的遗训，给我们指出为了在我国建设共产主义这一伟大事业而继续奋斗的明确方向。我们要更加紧密地、更加牢固地团结在我党中央委员会和苏维埃政府的周围。
    斯大林的不朽英名将永远活在我们的心中，活在苏维埃人民和全体进步人类的心中。
    斯大林为我国人民和全世界劳动人民的利益和幸福所进行的伟大事业永垂不朽！
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大的战无不胜的学说万岁！
    我们强盛的社会主义祖国，我们英雄的苏维埃人民万岁！
    伟大的苏联共产党万岁！（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科九日电）
