Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 20th:

Comrades! Brothers and Sisters! Dear Foreign Friends:

For the second time in a short period, we stand here now, on Wenceslas Square. This square is a witness to the history of many battles of our working people, a witness to the history of glorious victories, a witness to the history of heavy losses, and a witness to the history of sorrowful farewells.

Today, we gather here again because of the great misfortune that has befallen our country and all its people. Shortly after the passing of our beloved and unforgettable Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, his loyal comrade-in-arms and student, the leader of the working people of Czechoslovakia, the President of the Czechoslovak Republic and Chairman of the Communist Party, our Comrade Klement Gottwald, has also passed away.

Such a man has passed away: our people loved him because he was kind and caring to us; our people respected him because he was wise and great; our people revered him because, with his boundless energy and resolute will, he unswervingly cared for the welfare and happiness of the Republic and all the working people, until his last breath.

A great political leader and statesman has passed away, a father and mentor who cared for us has passed away, our closest and most beloved friend and comrade has passed away.

Such a man has passed away: his eternal glory and image will not only live forever in the hearts of our working people, but also live forever in the hearts of foreign working people.

Our grief is deep and immeasurable.

The loss we have suffered is enormous and irreparable.

Comrade Klement Gottwald, in the arduous struggle against the enemies of capitalism, in the great effort to establish a revolutionary Leninist-Stalinist party of the working class, was tempered into a true revolutionary leader of the working people. During the years of the bourgeois republic, Comrade Gottwald led all struggles against oppression, against deprivation of rights, against injustice, and led the struggle against the capitalist exploitation system that ruled our country at that time. Comrade Gottwald led the struggle for national liberation, freeing our people from the brutal tyranny of the fascist occupiers, a tyranny to which our people were abandoned by those false patriots and treacherous "allies" from the ranks of the petty bourgeoisie. After the glorious Soviet army liberated our country, Comrade Gottwald led our people in consolidating the achievements of the national and democratic revolution. He was the inspirer and organizer of the glorious victory of the working people of Czechoslovakia in February 1948 against the rebellious reactionaries. Under his leadership, our Czechoslovak Communist Party resolutely and ruthlessly purged those traitorous bandits who attempted to disintegrate our Party and hinder our march towards socialism.

Comrade Gottwald always excelled at creatively applying Marxist-Leninist theory and was able to develop this theory in practice under the conditions of our country. He tirelessly studied the experience of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Whether in his activity as a proletarian revolutionary, or in his work as the founder and first statesman of our liberated motherland, he was able to correctly apply this experience. As an unwavering believer in the doctrines of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and a loyal student of Stalin, he always placed the interests of the working people first and dedicated his entire life to fighting for their bright future.

In a few months, it will be the fifth anniversary of Comrade Klement Gottwald's unanimous election by the people as President of our People's Democratic Republic in the Vladislav Hall of the Prague Castle—a Czech royal palace of great historical significance. The election of Klement Gottwald, a proletarian and revolutionary fighter, as the first worker's president and leader of our People's Democratic Republic, demonstrated not only the people's wishes, but also their love, gratitude, and appreciation.

Comrade Klement Gottwald often taught us that the world's first socialist country, the country of Lenin and Stalin, the great and strong Soviet Union, is for us the true defender of our motherland's independence, the protector against the conspiracies of domestic and foreign bourgeois enemies, a shining example of building socialism, and our friend in times of weal and woe.

Therefore, in these sorrowful and difficult days, we pledge that we will never undermine the friendship and alliance with the Soviet people. We will unite more closely around our liberators and friends, who have demonstrated their friendship to us with repeated selfless assistance in the most difficult years. We will unite more closely around the defender of our independence and the protector of peace for all freedom-loving people in the world, around the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The life and works of Comrade Klement Gottwald primarily teach us: if the working people are to be liberated from the shackles of capitalism, if a nation wants to defend its freedom and independence, then it is necessary to manufacture weapons and train a conscious army that clearly identifies its goals, and capable, loyal leaders to fight the enemy and defend its rights; it is necessary to establish a truly powerful, united, and combative revolutionary Communist Party.

It was for the establishment of such a Communist Party that Comrade Gottwald dedicated his abundant energy, meritorious labor, and his entire life. The fact that our Party has been able to establish itself and develop; the fact that it has been able to become the truly steeled vanguard of the working class, the recognized leader of all working people; the fact that it has been able to create conditions that allow it to move forward purposefully and uninterruptedly, overcoming all obstacles and difficulties, crushing the rebellious acts of saboteurs, and always moving forward without ever taking a step back—all of this is inseparable from the name of Comrade Gottwald. It is only due to the careful leadership of Comrade Gottwald that our own powerful and unyielding Czechoslovak Communist Party—the protector of the progressive traditions of our nations, the inspirer of all the successes and victories of our working people—has grown strong.

Loyal to the legacy of Comrade Klement Gottwald, we must now and forever protect our own Communist Party as we protect the apple of our eye, safeguard its fighting strength and the purity of its ranks. We must continue to consolidate and strengthen the Party's combat effectiveness and unity, educating all Party members in the spirit of Gottwald, in the spirit of love for the motherland and the people, in the spirit of self-sacrifice and loyalty to the cause of socialism, in the spirit of loyalty and friendship to the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the world peace and progress camp. We must ensure that our Party members are not afraid of obstacles, always stand at the forefront of the working people in our cities and countryside, at the forefront of those who are completing our grand tasks of socialist construction at a rapid pace every day.

Comrade Klement Gottwald also taught us to learn to lead our free People's Democratic Republic ourselves. He taught us that it is not enough to write in the constitution that the people are the sole source of state power; it is necessary to truly establish the true unity of our working people, to find in the firm alliance of working people in cities and the countryside a source of strength that can ensure the sovereignty of the Republic and guarantee its path towards socialism.

Loyal to the legacy of Comrade Klement Gottwald, we must now and forever, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, establish the unity of the National Front of our working people in cities and the countryside, more vigorously master the art of leading the people for the benefit of the people, consolidate the freedom, progress, and peace of our country through the system of people's democracy, and lay a solid foundation for socialist construction in accordance with the will of the people and for the happiness of all.

Comrade Klement Gottwald, an outstanding student of Lenin and Stalin, saw and resolved the national question of the Czechs and Slovaks from the very beginning of his political activities. He was the creator of the unity and cooperation of the two nations in the new, liberated country.

Loyal to the legacy of Comrade Klement Gottwald, we must now and forever strengthen the cooperation and unity of the Czech and Slovak nations, strengthen the strength of our Republic from within, thereby arming our Republic against any conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad.

Comrade Gottwald constantly reminded us that the socialist construction in our country is now and will continue to be carried out under conditions of increasingly acute class struggle. He constantly called on us not to forget that the class enemies have not been completely eliminated, and they still want to use various methods and the power they still have to sabotage the peaceful construction of our people.

Loyal to the legacy of Comrade Gottwald, we must now and forever increase our vigilance, defend our socialist construction, abide by state and labor discipline, and severely and ruthlessly punish all those who want to harm us and hinder our construction labor.

Comrade Klement Gottwald recognized the significance of the sovereignty and independence of our people's democratic state in the cause of socialist construction in our country and did not forget to strengthen the defense capabilities of our Republic. He remembered Lenin's words that the weak would be beaten, and therefore strived to make our army a strong, well-equipped, and well-trained army that could crush any attempt by aggressors to carry out military adventures.

Loyal to the legacy of Comrade Klement Gottwald, we must now and forever continue to strengthen our army—the sentinel and pillar of freedom, sovereignty, independence, and peace.

Comrade Klement Gottwald was the architect of our Two-Year Recovery Plan and the First Five-Year Plan for the recovery and development of the national economy. Therefore, we call our first Five-Year Plan the Gottwald Five-Year Plan.

Comrade Gottwald taught us that in order to guarantee the freedom and independence of our motherland, it is necessary to ensure the development of our country's economy, so that our country is not only politically but also economically strong and does not depend on capitalist countries. He pointed out to us that, on the one hand, we rely on cooperation and alliance with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and on the other hand, we should further develop the economic resources of our country in industry and agriculture, because only by increasing labor productivity more quickly can we create various conditions to guarantee the prosperity of our motherland and the gradual improvement of the people's welfare.

Loyal to the legacy of Comrade Klement Gottwald, we must now and forever gloriously complete the Klement Gottwald Five-Year Plan and continue to develop and consolidate the economic foundation of socialist construction. We must further consolidate and develop our industry, especially heavy industry, and systematically continue the socialist transformation of our agriculture. We must utilize the abilities and wisdom of our working people. We must learn together, and everyone must strive to do his job better and more perfectly, so that each of us can be responsible for his part of the work and become the master of the entire social happiness and prosperity in his job.

Comrade Gottwald taught us that it is not enough to strive solely for the peaceful construction of our motherland. It is also necessary to combine our struggle for peace with the worldwide struggle for peace against war.

Loyal to the legacy of Comrade Klement Gottwald, we must now and forever intensify our peaceful construction at home. We know that the cause of defending peace is in our hands and that it is within our ability to undertake it. We must continuously develop and increase our industrial and agricultural output, and complete and overfulfill our economic plans. We must support the Soviet Union's peace policy with greater strength, consolidate friendly relations with the People's Republic of China, the people's democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic, and consolidate friendly relations with all good men and women in the world—no matter where they live—and with all those who love peace and hate war.

As Comrade Malenkov announced at the commemoration meeting for Comrade Stalin, we also want to announce here, before the spirit of our President and Chairman of the leading party of the National Front: according to the Leninist-Stalinist principles, we do not reject the possibility of long-term coexistence and peaceful competition of different systems and regimes. We will now and forever strive to pursue a policy of international cooperation and developing relations between countries on the principles of equality, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and non-infringement on each other's sovereignty.

Comrades, brothers and sisters!

At the climax of our efforts to complete the first Five-Year Plan, Comrade Klement Gottwald bid farewell to us forever. This Five-Year Plan should and must lay the foundation for further socialist construction in our country. This is a great and sacred legacy.

The noble goal of this legacy—to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of society (Comrade Gottwald, a loyal student of Comrade Stalin, was convinced that this goal could be achieved)—is a cause worth pursuing with all our strength by those of us who inherit Gottwald's legacy.

We want to prove to the world: the field cultivated by the enthusiastic tiller on the people's land will never be abandoned halfway due to his unfortunate death, and will never be left barren.

We must closely unite the ranks in the strong front of socialist builders in cities and the countryside, firmly grasp the sickle and hammer, gloriously complete the first Gottwald Five-Year Plan, and pave the way for promoting the completion of the great socialist project of the epoch and increasing the happiness of the people in our beloved Czechoslovak Republic.

Comrade Gottwald, we swear to you: we will definitely carry out your great and sacred legacy!

Comrade Gottwald, we swear to you: we will definitely continue to strengthen and temper our beloved, our own Communist Party!

Comrade Gottwald, we swear to you: with the firm will to realize your legacy, we must unite the entire National Front and all good men and women who are striving for the independence of our motherland and for the comprehensive development and welfare of our people around our Party!

Comrade Gottwald, we swear to you: we must launch socialist competition, increase labor productivity, strengthen our country's defense capabilities, and, together with the camp of peace advocates around the world, crush all anti-peace conspiracies and defend peace!

Comrade Gottwald, we swear to you: we will never betray the consolidated and true friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union—our liberator, the country of the great Lenin and Stalin, the leader of peace and progress!

Our dear mentor and friend, Comrade Gottwald, we offer you our last, comradely, fighting salute!

Glory to your great labor!

Your great name will live forever!

Czechoslovak Shock Troops, Forward! Forward under the banner of Lenin-Stalin! For the realization of the goals that Comrade Gottwald fought for throughout his life, and for the advancement of socialist construction in our country!

Forward, forward, forever forward!

专栏：

    在哥特瓦尔德总统追悼大会上
    捷总理萨波托斯基的讲话同志们！兄弟姊妹们！亲爱的外国朋友们：
    在很短的时期内，我们现在是第二次站在这里，站在瓦茨拉夫广场上。这个广场是我们劳动人民的许多次战斗的历史见证人，光荣胜利的历史见证人，沉重损失的历史见证人，悲痛诀别的历史见证人。
    今天，由于我们国家和全体人民遭到巨大的不幸，我们又聚集在这里了。在我们亲爱的、永怀不忘的约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林同志逝世以后不久，他的忠实的战友和学生、捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的领袖、捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统和共产党主席、我们的克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志也逝世了。
    这样一个人逝世了：我们人民爱戴他，因为他对我们慈祥、关心；我们人民尊重他，因为他是英明的伟大的；我们人民尊敬他，因为他用他的无穷无尽的劳动精力和坚决意志，始终不渝地关心共和国和全体劳动人民的福利与幸福，一直到他停止呼吸的时候。
    一位伟大的政治领袖和政治家逝世了，关心我们的父亲和导师逝世了，我们心中最亲近的与最敬爱的朋友和同志逝世了。
    这样一个人逝世了：他的永久的光荣和形象不仅将永远活在我们劳动人民的心中，而且也永远活在外国劳动人民的心中。
    我们的悲痛是深切的、不可衡量的。
    我们遭到的损失是巨大的、不可弥补的。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志在对资本主义敌人进行的艰苦斗争中，在建立列宁—斯大林式的革命的工人阶级政党的巨大努力中，锻炼成为劳动人民的真正的革命领袖。在资产阶级共和国的年代里，哥特瓦尔德同志领导了一切反对压迫、反对剥夺权利、反对不公道的斗争，领导了和当时统治我国的资本主义剥削制度进行的斗争。哥特瓦尔德同志领导了民族解放的斗争，使我国人民摆脱法西斯占领者的残酷暴政，而我国人民就是被那些小资产阶级队伍中的假爱国者和背信弃义的外国“同盟者”抛到这种暴政之下的。在光荣的苏联军队把我们国家解放了以后，哥特瓦尔德同志领导我们人民巩固了民族和民主革命的成果。他是捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民在一九四八年二月对谋叛的反动派进行的斗争中获得的光荣胜利的鼓舞者和组织者。在他的领导之下，我们捷克斯洛伐克共产党坚决无情地清除了那些力图瓦解我们党和阻挠我们走向社会主义的卖国贼匪帮。
    哥特瓦尔德同志一向善于创造性地运用马克思列宁的学说，并且能在我国的条件下在实践中发展这个学说。他不倦地学习苏联和苏联共产党的经验。无论是在他作为无产阶级革命家的活动中，或者在他作为我们解放了的祖国的缔造者和第一个政治家的工作中，他都善于正确地运用这些经验。作为马克思、恩格斯、列宁学说的始终不渝的信徒和斯大林的忠诚的学生，他总是首先考虑劳动人民的利益，并且一生都为劳动人民的美好将来而奋斗。
    再过几个月，就是克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志在捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统府的弗拉吉斯拉夫大厅——具有光辉的历史意义的捷克王宫——中被人民
    一致选举为我们人民民主共和国总统的五周年了。把作为无产阶级和革命的战士克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志选举为我们人民民主共和国的第一任工人的总统和领袖，不仅说明了人民的愿望，而且也说明了人们的热爱、感激和感谢。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志经常教导我们说，世界上第一个社会主义国家，列宁和斯大林的国家，伟大而坚强的苏联，对我们说来，是我们祖国的独立的真正的保卫者，是对国内外资产阶级敌人的阴谋的防范者，是建设社会主义的光辉榜样，是我们的可共甘苦的朋友。
    因此，我们在这些沉痛的困难的日子里保证，我们永远不会破坏与苏联人民的友谊和同盟。我们要更紧密地团结在我们的解放者和朋友的周围，他们曾在最困难的岁月里以多次的无私的援助证实了对我们的友谊。我们要更紧密地团结在我们的独立的保卫者和全世界爱好自由人民的和平的保卫者的周围，团结在苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的周围。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志的一生和著作首先教导我们：如果劳动人民要从资本主义的桎梏下解放出来，如果一个民族要想保卫住它的自由和独立，那末，就必须要制造武器和训练明确自己目标的自觉的军队和有能力的、忠诚的领导人来与敌人作斗争并保卫自己的权利；就必须建立一个真正强大的、统一的、善于战斗的革命的共产党。
    正是为了建立这样的共产党，哥特瓦尔德同志献出了他的充沛的精力、功绩卓著的劳动和他的整个生命。我们的党之所以能够建立起来和向前发展；它之所以能够变成工人阶级的真正经过锻炼的先锋队，成为全体劳动人民公认的领导者；它之所以能够创造了这样的条件，使它自己能够毫不间断地有目的地前进，克服一切障碍和困难，击破破坏分子的叛变行动，永远向前迈进，决不后退一步——这一切都是和哥特瓦尔德同志的名字分不开的。只是由于哥特瓦尔德同志的精心领导，我们自己的强大的不屈不挠的捷克斯洛伐克共产党——我们各民族进步传统的保卫者、我国劳动人民的一切成功和胜利的鼓舞者——才成长起来。
    我们忠实于克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志的遗训，今后一定要像保护眼珠一样地保护自己的共产党，保护它的战斗力量和它的队伍的纯洁。我们要继续巩固和加强党的战斗力和团结一致，以哥特瓦尔德的精神，以热爱祖国和人民的精神，以自我牺牲和忠实于社会主义事业的精神，以忠于苏联、各人民民主国家和世界和平进步阵营并与它们友好的精神教育全体党员。我们要使我们党员不怕障碍，始终站在我国城乡劳动人民的前面，站在那些每天以突击速度完成我国宏大社会主义建设任务的人们的最前列。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志同时教导我们，要学会自己领导我们自由的人民民主共和国。他教导我们说：为了使人民成为国家政权的唯一泉源，只在宪法上写下这么一句话是不够的，必须真正建立起我们劳动人民的真正团结一致，必须在城乡劳动人民的牢固同盟中找出这样一种力量的泉源，它能够确保共和国的主权并保证共和国走向社会主义的道路。
    我们忠实于克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志的遗训，今后一定要在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下建立起我们城乡劳动人民民族阵线的团结一致，更顽强地去掌握为人民谋福利的领导人民的艺术，通过人民民主制度来巩固我国的自由、进步与和平，遵照人民的意志和为了大家的幸福打好社会主义建设的牢固基础。
    列宁和斯大林的优秀学生克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志从他政治活动一开始就看到了而且解决了捷克和斯洛伐克的民族问题。他是两个民族在新的、解放了的国家中团结一致与合作的创造者。
    我们忠实于克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志的遗训，今后一定要加强捷克和斯洛伐克民族的合作和团结，加强我们共和国内部的实力，从而武装我们共和国，以对付内外敌人的任何阴谋。
    哥特瓦尔德同志不断地提醒我们：我国的社会主义建设现在和将来都要在阶级斗争日趋尖锐的情况下进行。他一直号召我们不要忘记，阶级敌人还没有被彻底消灭，他们还想用种种方法和他们现在还有的力量来破坏我们人民的和平建设劳动。
    我们忠实于哥特瓦尔德同志的遗训，今后一定要提高自己的警惕，保卫我们的社会主义建设，遵守国家的和劳动的纪律，严厉而无情地惩处一切想加害于我们、阻挠我们的建设劳动的人。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志认识到在我国社会主义建设事业中我们人民民主国家的主权和独立的意义，没有忘记加强我们共和国的防御力量。他记着列宁说的弱者要挨打的话，因此竭力使我们的军队成为强有力的、装备很好的、有锻炼的军队，可以粉碎任何侵略者进行军事冒险的企图。
    我们忠实于克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志的遗训，今后一定要继续加强我们的军队——自由、主权、独立与和平的哨兵和支柱。
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志是我们二年复兴计划和第一个复兴与发展国民经济五年计划的制订者。因此，我们把我们的第一个五年计划称为哥特瓦尔德五年计划。
    哥特瓦尔德同志教导我们说，为了保证我们祖国的自由和独立，必须保证我国经济的发展，以便我国不但在政治上而且在经济上都强大，不依赖资本主义国家。他向我们指出，我们一方面依靠与苏联和人民民主国家的合作和同盟，一方面应该更多地开发我们国家的工业和农业方面的经济资源，因为只有更快地提高劳动生产率，才能为我们创造种种条件，来保证我们祖国的繁荣、保证人民福利有步骤地增进。
    我们忠实于克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志的遗训，今后一定要光荣地完成克利门特·哥特瓦尔德五年计划，并继续发展和巩固社会主义建设的经济基础。我们一定要进一步巩固和发展我们的工业，首先是重工业，并且有系统地继续进行我们农业的社会主义改造。我们一定要利用我们劳动人民的能力和智慧。我们一定要共同学习，每个人要努力把他的工作做得更好、更完美，使我们每一个人都能对他的那一部分工作负责，并且在他的工作岗位上成为关心整个社会幸福和繁荣的主人翁。
    哥特瓦尔德同志教导我们说，仅仅为保障我们祖国的安静的和平建设而奋斗，是不够的。还必须把我们争取和平的斗争和全世界争取和平反对战争的斗争结合起来。
    我们忠实于克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志的遗训，今后一定要加紧进行我们国内的和平建设。我们知道，保卫和平的事业掌握在我们手中，而且是我们的能力可以担当起来的，我们要不断地发展和提高我们的工业和农业产量，完成和超额完成我们的经济计划。我们要用更大的力量来支持苏联的和平政策，巩固与中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国的友好关系，巩固与全世界一切善良男女——不管他们住在什么地方——以及与一切爱好和平和痛恨战争的人们的友好关系。
    正如马林科夫同志在斯大林同志追悼大会上所宣布的那样，我们也要在这里、在我们总统和民族阵线的领导政党的主席的灵前宣布：根据列宁—斯大林的原则，我们并不排斥不同的制度和政权长期共处与和平竞赛的可能性。我们现在和将来都要努力奉行国际合作和在平等的与不干涉对方内政不侵犯对方主权的原则下发展国与国间事务关系的政策。
    同志们、兄弟姐妹们！
    在我们争取完成第一个五年计划的努力达到高潮的时候，克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志和我们永别了。这一个五年计划应该而且一定要奠定在我国进
    一步建设社会主义的基础。这是一个伟大的神圣的遗训。
    这个遗训的崇高目标——保证社会的物质和文化要求得到最大限度的满足（斯大林同志的忠实学生哥特瓦尔德同志深信是可以完成这个目标的）——是值得我们继承哥特瓦尔德遗志的人们拿出全部力量来促其实现的事业。
    我们要向全世界证明：热心的耕耘者在人民的土地上耕耘的田地，决不会因为他的不幸的逝世而让它半途而废，决不会让它荒芜。
    我们要紧密地团结城乡社会主义建设者强大阵线中的队伍，要紧紧地握住镰刀和锤子，要光荣地完成第一个哥特瓦尔德五年计划，要为在我们亲爱的捷克斯洛伐克共和国内促进划时代的伟大的社会主义工程的完成和增进人民的幸福，开辟道路。
    哥特瓦尔德同志，我们向你宣誓：我们一定执行你的伟大的神圣的遗训！
    哥特瓦尔德同志，我们向你宣誓：我们一定继续加强和锻炼我们亲爱的、我们自己的共产党！
    哥特瓦尔德同志，我们向你宣誓：我们怀着实现你的遗训的坚决意志，一定要把整个民族阵线和所有为我们祖国的独立、为我国人民的全面发展和福利而奋斗的善良男女团结在我们党的周围！
    哥特瓦尔德同志，我们向你宣誓：我们一定要展开社会主义竞赛，提高劳动生产率，加强我们国家的国防力量，并且和全世界和平拥护者的阵营一起，粉碎一切反和平的阴谋，保卫和平！
    哥特瓦尔德同志，我们向你宣誓：我们永远不会背弃对苏联——我们的解放者、伟大的列宁和斯大林的国家、和平和进步的领导者——的巩固的和真实的友谊和同盟！
    我们亲爱的导师和朋友哥特瓦尔德同志，我们向你致以最后的、同志的、战斗的敬礼！
    光荣归于你的伟大的劳动！
    你的英名永垂不朽！
    捷克斯洛伐克突击队，前进！在列宁—斯大林的旗帜下前进！为实现哥特瓦尔德同志一生奋斗的目标、为在我们国家建设社会主义前进！
    前进，前进，永远前进！
                        （新华社据塔斯社布拉格二十日电）
