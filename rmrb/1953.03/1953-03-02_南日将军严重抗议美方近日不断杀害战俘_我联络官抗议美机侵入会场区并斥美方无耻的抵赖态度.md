Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st — Recently, the US side has again continuously killed our captured personnel. On February 21st, the US side killed one of our captured personnel in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp; on February 23rd, the US side shot dead one of our captured personnel in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp and injured one in the Bongam Island prisoner-of-war camp; on February 25th, the US side shot dead one of our captured personnel on Geoje Island and injured two, and injured one of our captured personnel on Bongam Island. General Nan Il, Chief Delegate of our side to the Korean Armistice Negotiations, lodged a strong protest with the other side on February 28th regarding these incessant incidents of US abuse and slaughter of prisoners of war, and solemnly pointed out that the other side cannot escape full responsibility for these war crimes.
	
Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st — At about 13:20 on the afternoon of February 26th, US military aircraft again violated the Korean Armistice Negotiation Conference Area Agreement and intruded into the airspace above the Panmunjom Conference Area. When security officers from both sides of the conference area conducted a joint investigation, witnesses to the incident confirmed the US side's responsibility for violating the agreement. The other side's military police also fully admitted this fact, pointing out that the weather was clear at the time, with no wind and no clouds. On February 28th, our Chief Liaison Officer protested to the other side regarding this violation of the agreement and demanded that the other side provide a responsible explanation for the incident and take effective measures to prevent similar incidents from recurring. At the liaison officers' meeting on the same day, the other side could not deny the fact that its military aircraft had flown over the conference area, but reiterated its absurd and cliché-ridden arguments, clumsily distorting the provisions of the agreement, claiming that military aircraft flying over the conference area did not violate the agreement, but was permitted under the understanding that climate and technical conditions were uncontrollable, attempting to evade responsibility. Our Liaison Officer immediately and solemnly questioned the other side: what uncontrollable climate and technical conditions existed at approximately 13:20 on the afternoon of February 26th? The other side prevaricated and was unable to respond. Our Liaison Officer finally pointed out that the other side's destruction of the agreement, distortion of the agreement, and frivolous attitude toward the agreement clearly demonstrates a planned effort to undermine all administrative foundations of the armistice negotiations, but the other side can never escape full responsibility for destroying the agreement, nor can it ever escape the condemnation of the people of the world for its criminal actions in destroying the agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st — The US Chief Liaison Officer was unable to deny today that US aircraft had once again intruded into the Panmunjom Conference Area on the 26th, but adopted another method of denying responsibility – shameless silence. At a liaison officers' meeting, US Liaison Officer Carroc said that this flyover "probably occurred" but was due to "climatic and technical difficulties." Our Liaison Officer, Colonel Chai Chengwen, repeatedly asked Carroc to specify what "climatic and technical difficulties" existed when the flyover occurred. Carroc could only say, "I have nothing else to say." The fact is that in the joint investigation conducted by both sides after the flyover occurred, even one of the US military police officers admitted to witnessing the flyover, and he even drew the route of the flyover on the spot. When the US security officer asked him what the visibility was at the time, he said "clear"; when asked if there was wind, he said "no." Other witnesses even saw US aircraft bombing and strafing our nearby positions immediately after flying over the conference area. The bilateral agreement and understanding clearly stipulate that "except in cases where climatic conditions and technical conditions are uncontrollable, neither side's military aircraft shall fly over the Panmunjom Conference Area." Although the US spokesperson in Panmunjom can remain shamelessly silent, this cannot change the ironclad fact that US aircraft have continuously violated the agreement in the eyes of the world's people.

    南日将军严重抗议美方近日不断杀害战俘
    我联络官抗议美机侵入会场区并斥美方无耻的抵赖态度
    【新华社开城一日电】近日来美方又不断地杀害我方被俘人员。二月二十一日美方在济州岛战俘营害死我方被俘人员一名，二月二十三日美方在巨济岛战俘营打死我方被俘人员一名，在蜂岩岛战俘营打伤我方被俘人员一名；二月二十五日美方在巨济岛上打死我方被俘人员一名，打伤两名，又在蜂岩岛上打伤我方被俘人员一名。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军，在二月二十八日对这些层出不穷的美方虐害屠杀战俘的事件向对方提出严重抗议，并严正指出对方决不能逃脱对这些战争罪行的完全责任。
    【新华社开城一日电】二月二十六日下午一时二十分左右，美方军用飞机又违反朝鲜停战谈判会场区协议，侵入板门店会场区上空。会场区双方安全军官进行共同调查时，目击这一事件发生的证人证实了美方违反协议的责任，对方军事警察亦完全承认这一事实，并指出当时气候清朗，既无风又无云。二月二十八日我方首席联络官对美方这一违反协议的事件向对方提出抗议，并要求对方对此事件作出负责交代，以及采取有效措施使类似事件不再发生。当天双方联络官会议上对方无法抵赖其军用飞机飞越会场区的事实，但重弹其荒谬的滥调，笨拙地歪曲协议条文。诡称军用飞机飞越会场区并不违反协议，而是谅解中规定气候与技术条件无法控制下所许可的，企图借此逃脱责任。我方联络官当即严正质问对方：在二月二十六日下午一时二十分左右，有什么气候与技术条件无法控制，对方支吾其辞，无言以对。我方联络官最后指出对方破坏协议、歪曲协议、以儿戏的态度对待协议，分明是在有计划地破坏停战谈判的一切行政基础，但对方永远不能逃脱破坏协议的完全责任，也永远不能逃脱全世界人民对其破坏协议的罪恶行动的斥责。
    【新华社开城一日电】美方首席联络官今日无法否认美机二十六日又一次侵入板门店会场区，但采取了另一种抵赖责任的办法——厚颜的沉默。在一次联络官会议上，美方联络官卡洛克说：这次飞越事件“大概曾经发生”，不过是由于“气候和技术的困难”。我方联络官柴成文上校一再要求卡洛克具体说明，这次飞越发生时有什么“气候和技术的困难”。卡洛克只能说“我没有别的话要说”。事实是在飞越发生后双方共同进行的调查中，连美方自己的一名军事警察也承认目睹飞越，他并且当场画出了飞越的路线来。美方安全军官问他当时的能见度如何，他说“清晰”；问他有风没有，他说“没有”。其他证人更目击美机飞越会场区后，随即向附近的我方阵地轰炸、扫射。双方协议和谅解明白规定，“除在气候条件与技术条件无法控制的情况下，双方军用飞机均不得飞越板门店会场区上空”。美方在板门店的发言人虽能厚颜沉默，但这一点也不能在世界人民面前改变美机连续破坏协议这一铁的事实。
