The CCP Shenyang Municipal Committee organized over a hundred cadres from the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, the People's Economic Planning Commission, and various construction units in early February to inspect the preparatory work of basic construction units throughout the city. This work is now substantially complete.

The inspection revealed that the preparatory work for construction in most units was poorly done, and leading cadres displayed a serious waiting and dependency mentality. Some units, while having done some preparatory work, were still far from meeting the requirements for construction. Other units had done no preparatory work at all, not even knowing how much material would be needed for the entire year's projects. The Mechanical and Electrical Installation Company of the Machinery Bureau, which had already started construction on some projects in February, had a materials section that was completely unaware of which materials had been prepared and which had not. The head of the materials section even stated, "The materials are stocked by Party A. If construction is affected, Party A will compensate for the losses. It's none of our business!" No one in the Logistics Department of the Northeast Military Region had been responsible for basic construction preparation work. When the CCP Shenyang Municipal Committee inspection team went to inspect, the cadres in the department's Barracks Management Department responsible for basic construction work said, "Our projects are handled by the Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau." However, when asked, the Construction Engineering Bureau claimed ignorance. Neither side took responsibility. The cadres doing basic construction work in the Logistics Department felt that, "Our projects are important. Anyway, the state will have to provide whatever we need!" Therefore, they were not in a hurry.

Due to the waiting and dependency mentality, processing and ordering of plumbing, small hardware, and electrical appliances materials had not even begun. Units such as the Northeast Mechanical Industry Bureau and the Nonferrous Metals Bureau had not even compiled preliminary requirement plans. One of the main reasons for the delays in the progress of certain projects in the third quarter of last year, which resulted in work stoppages due to lack of materials and people being unable to move into completed buildings, was the lack of preparation for these materials. If this issue is not resolved early this year, the mistakes of last year will inevitably be repeated.

There were also delays in transportation work. For example, the No. 2 Company of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, which was contracted to repair the 111 Factory project, had a large transportation task and was scheduled to start construction in early April. However, the transportation work was not being handled tightly. By the time of the inspection, only about 800,000 of the 30 million bricks allocated by the state had been transported. Similar phenomena were also observed in the Machinery, Nonferrous Metals, and Electrical Engineering Bureaus. According to past experience, if material preparation and transportation are not expedited in the first quarter, the transportation company will be even less able to complete the consignment tasks during the peak construction months, which will inevitably affect project progress.

In addition, some units also lacked planning in their preparatory work. The Civil Engineering Company of the Machinery Bureau had prepared enough sand and gravel for the entire year, but the amount of major materials prepared, such as bricks and wood, only accounted for 10% of the total annual demand. The preparation of tinplate, hardware, paint, and electrical wire had not yet begun.

After this inspection, some units have begun to reverse the erroneous thinking of waiting, dependency, and one-sided emphasis on difficulties. In addition to reviewing the failure to actively organize existing forces and to do a good job in project, labor, and material planning, the manager of the Mechanical and Electrical Installation Company of the Machinery Bureau instructed various departments to further mobilize the masses, inspect the work, and formulate work plans for each unit. At the same time, personnel were sent to contact Party A to discuss material preparation. However, in general, the waiting and dependency mentality has not been completely corrected.

### 中共沈阳市委检查全市基本建设准备工作  发现多数单位等待依赖思想严重

    中共沈阳市委检查全市基本建设准备工作
    发现多数单位等待依赖思想严重
    中共沈阳市委于二月上旬组织沈阳市人民政府、人民经济计划委员会及各施工单位一百余名干部，配合各施工部门检查了全市基本建设单位的准备工作，现已基本结束。
    从这次检查结果来看，多数单位施工准备工作都做得不好，领导干部的等待、依赖思想很严重。这些单位有的虽然做了一些准备工作，但距施工要求还很远；有的单位则一点准备工作也没有做，甚至对全年工程到底需要多少材料都不知道。机械局机电安装公司承包的部分工程，在二月份即陆续施工，但哪些材料准备了，哪些还未准备，材料科
    一概不知道。材料科长还说：“材料由甲方储备，影响施工由甲方赔偿损失，与我们没有关系！”东北军区后勤部的基本建设准备工作一直没有人负责。中共沈阳市委检查组去检查工作时，该部营房管理部做基本建设工作的干部说：“我们工程由东北建筑工程局负责。”而问建筑工程局时，又说不知道，双方都不负责任。后勤部做基本建设工作的干部觉得：“我们工程重要，反正什么时候要东西，国家也得给！”因此不着急。
    由于有等待、依赖思想，水暖、小五金、电器等材料的加工订货，还都没有着手筹划。东北机械工业管理局、有色金属管理局等单位连初步需要的计划都没有编做。去年第三季度某些工程进度迟缓、造成停工待料、盖起大楼搬不进去人，其重要原因之一就是这些材料没准备好，今年若不及早解决这个问题，势必重蹈去年覆辙。
    在运输工作上也存在拖拉现象。如沈阳市建筑工程局第二公司承修的一一一厂工程，运输任务庞大，于四月上旬就要陆续开工，但运输工作却抓得很不紧，国家调拨的三千万块红砖，到检查时为止，只运了八十万块左右。在机械、有色金属、电工等局也均有类似现象。据过去经验，若第一季不抓紧备料运输，挤到开工旺月，运输公司更无法完成托运任务，势必影响工程进度。
    另外，有的单位准备工作的计划性也很差。机械局土建公司的砂石已准备够全年使用，而红砖、木材等主要材料准备的数量仅达全年需用量的百分之十。白铁、五金、油漆、电线等材料尚未着手储备。
    经过这次检查，某些单位已开始扭转了等待、依赖和片面强调困难的错误思想。机械局机电安装公司经理除检讨了没有积极组织现有力量，做好工程、劳动、材料计划外，并指示各科进一步发动群众，检查工作，拟订了各单位的工作计划；同时派人和甲方联系备料情况。但总的说来，等待、依赖思想并未彻底纠正。
