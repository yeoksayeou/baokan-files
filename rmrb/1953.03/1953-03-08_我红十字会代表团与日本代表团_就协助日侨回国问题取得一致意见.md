    Our Red Cross Delegation and Japanese Delegation
    Reach Agreement on Assisting Japanese Nationals to Return Home

    [Xinhua News Agency, March 7th] The Chinese Red Cross delegation and the delegation composed of the Japanese Red Cross, the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee, and the Japan-China Friendship Association held formal talks in Beijing from February 15th to assist Japanese nationals who wished to return home. After the fourth meeting on the 5th, they reached a consensus on ship arrival procedures and all relevant specific issues, and unanimously adopted a communique. (The full text of the communique will be issued separately.)

    After Liao Chengzhi, the chief representative of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, and Tadatsugu Shimazu, the head of the Japanese delegation, read the communique, Mr. Shimazu delivered a speech. Mr. Shimazu expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese Red Cross for its warm assistance to the Japanese delegation, which made the talks a complete success. He emphasized that the success of this meeting showed that any difficulty can be overcome as long as one stands on the position of peace, friendship and genuine humanitarianism. Therefore, it will greatly contribute to the friendship between the two peoples and to world peace. To express his gratitude to the Chinese Red Cross, Mr. Shimazu invited the representatives of the Chinese Red Cross to visit Japan this autumn in order to strengthen the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

    Next, Liao Chengzhi, the chief representative of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, delivered a speech. Liao Chengzhi pointed out that the success of this meeting showed that as long as the Chinese people and the peace-loving Japanese people strengthen their unity, difficulties can be overcome, and the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people can be further strengthened. He expressed his gratitude for Mr. Shimazu's invitation to the Chinese Red Cross representatives to visit Japan, because such a visit could promote the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. Liao Chengzhi mentioned that law-abiding Japanese nationals have lived a peaceful life under the protection of the People's Government during their residence in our country, and he hoped that after they returned to Japan, they would not be discriminated against and persecuted by the Japanese government because they had lived and worked in our country, but that they would be able to live a peaceful and happy life. He went on to say that there are now tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in Japan, many of whom hope to return to the embrace of their motherland. He asked the Japanese Red Cross, the Japanese Peace Liaison Committee, and the Japan-China Friendship Association, especially the Japanese Red Cross, to assist them in facilitating their return home. He said: The expenses required for overseas Chinese in Japan to return to China can be borne by the Chinese side. He finally wished the three Japanese organizations greater achievements in strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and in the common cause of peace.

    Mr. Shimazu and Mr. Takara Tomi, the deputy head, thanked Chief Representative Liao Chengzhi for his concern for the Japanese nationals returning home, and expressed their willingness to make the greatest efforts to assist overseas Chinese in Japan to return home. Deputy Head Hirano stood up and expressed his willingness to assist in sending the ashes of Chinese prisoners of war who died in Japan during the war to China. Chief Representative Liao Chengzhi finally said that he thanked the Japanese friends for their concern and was willing to accept the ashes of our martyred compatriots with a solemn ceremony.

    The meeting ended in a friendly atmosphere.
