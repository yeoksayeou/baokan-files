    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, 1953, Issue 6 Introduction
    The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" 1953, Issue 6, has been published.
    This issue commemorates the tenth anniversary of the great victory of the Soviet army at Stalingrad and publishes an editorial entitled "The Immortal Glory of Stalingrad," along with several articles celebrating this festival and excerpts from newspaper commentaries. The editorial states: Ten years ago, the glorious victory of the Soviet army at Stalingrad marked a decisive turning point in World War II, laying a solid foundation for the complete defeat of the Hitlerite bandits. At the time of the Battle of Stalingrad, the American and British ruling groups possessed an army of more than six million and a large amount of weapons and equipment. Despite this, they violated their solemn promise to open a second battlefield in 1942. The root of this policy lay in their imperialist aims in the war; their main goal was to weaken and exhaust the Soviet Union and undermine its international prestige. However, this plan suffered a complete failure. The victory at Stalingrad further enhanced the Soviet Union's international prestige. In discussing the international significance of the victory at Stalingrad, the editorial said: The victory at Stalingrad injected the belief in liberation into the hearts of the people of all countries enslaved by German fascism and inspired their resolute and courageous fighting spirit. Under the powerful impact of the victory at Stalingrad, the struggle of the oppressed peoples of Europe against the fascist bandit regime entered a new and higher level and began to become a universal struggle. The flames of national liberation struggles in China and other Asian countries also became increasingly bright. The editorial finally emphasized that American imperialists are trying to prevent the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries from steadily advancing on the road of economic rise and cultural development. They send spies, special agents, saboteurs, and assassins to these countries. Therefore, the working people of the socialist camp must be more vigilant and guard against the intrusion of imperialist war-mongers.
    Other important articles published in this issue include: "On Class Struggle in People's Democratic Countries" by A. Cepicka, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, "The Inspiring Role of the Great Stalin's Thought" by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and "Achievements of the Second Congress of the Guatemalan Labor Party" by A. Guerra Borges, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Guatemalan Labor Party.
    Cepicka's article pointed out: The socialist construction of the European People's Democratic countries is carried out in the context of increasingly sharp class struggle. Cepicka discussed the circumstances in which the traitorous bourgeois reactionaries and imperialist agents and spies, under the direction of imperialist aggressors, conspired to disintegrate the Communist Party, seize power, and restore capitalism, as well as their failures. Cepicka also discussed the class struggle on the ideological front and one of the main forms of class struggle in the era of the dictatorship of the proletariat—cultivating new labor discipline.
    Cepicka pointed out: The experience of the working people of the Soviet Union in carrying out class struggle, as well as the process of class struggle in various People's Democratic countries, fully confirms that during the transition from capitalism to socialism, the class struggle does not extinguish or weaken; on the contrary, it becomes heated and increasingly sharp. The Soviet experience and assistance are of inestimable significance to the working people of the People's Democratic countries in achieving victory in the class struggle. They learned from these experiences how to fight and defeat class enemies. Soviet assistance and support enabled them to successfully solve all difficulties and overcome all obstacles. If it were not for the existence of the Soviet Union, there is no doubt that the imperialists would have organized a united intervention against the People's Democratic countries, just as they did after the October Revolution. The fact that the People's Democratic countries are advancing towards socialism relying on the powerful strength of the Soviet Union is a decisive factor in the fierce struggle against enemies at home and abroad. The increasingly sharp class struggle requires Communist and Workers' Parties to heighten revolutionary vigilance. Complacency is the most dangerous thing, because it arises from pride and complacency after victory. Cepicka pointed out in his discussion of the struggle on the ideological front: We must strengthen the communist education of the working people. In the context of the increasingly sharp class struggle, it is particularly important to educate Party members and all working people in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, high political vigilance, and socialist patriotism, and to cultivate love and loyalty to the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union. Cepicka also pointed out that in cultivating new labor discipline, the Party and the state must take persuading the people as their main weapon. It must be ensured that every working person is convinced that socialism cannot be built without conscious discipline.
    Pollitt's article proves the correctness of Stalin's genius definition of the basic economic laws of modern capitalism with concrete facts from Britain, and contrasts modern capitalist society with socialist society with concrete facts from Britain and the Soviet Union. Pollitt also emphasized that one principle conclusion we in Britain must draw from the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the need to strengthen the Communist Party of Great Britain. Another important lesson that British Communists have learned from the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is that the weapon of criticism and self-criticism must be used more widely.
    Guerra Borges' article introduced the situation and achievements of the Second Congress of the Guatemalan Labor Party. The congress criticized the erroneous views of some Party members within the Guatemalan Labor Party on the nature of the current revolution in Guatemala and the issue of revolutionary leadership. The political line and program adopted by the congress put forward the task of fully developing the anti-feudal and anti-imperialist revolution to the Party.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第六期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第六期已经出版。
    本期为纪念苏联军队在斯大林格勒伟大胜利的十周年发表题为“斯大林格勒的不朽光荣”的社论，并刊载了若干庆祝这个节日的文章和报纸言论摘要。社论说：十年以前，光荣的苏联军队在斯大林格勒的胜利标志了第二次世界大战中的决定性的转折点，为彻底战胜希特勒匪帮打下了坚实的基础。美英统治集团在斯大林格勒会战时，拥有六百万人以上的军队和大量的武器与装备。尽管这样，他们却违背了在一九四二年开辟第二战场的庄严诺言。这个政策的根源是他们在战争中所抱的帝国主义目的，他们的主要目标是削弱和枯竭苏联，破坏它的国际威望。但是，这种打算遭受了彻底的失败。斯大林格勒的胜利更加提高了苏联在国际上的威望。社论在谈到斯大林格勒胜利的国际意义时说：斯大林格勒的胜利在被德国法西斯奴役的各国人民心中注入了解放的信念，鼓舞了他们的坚决勇敢的斗志。在斯大林格勒的胜利的有力冲击下，欧洲各国被压迫民族的反对法西斯强盗政权的斗争进入了一个新的更高的水平，而且开始成为一个普遍的斗争。中国和亚洲其他国家的民族解放斗争的火焰也越来越明亮。社论最后强调说：美帝国主义者力图阻止苏联和人民民主国家在经济上升和文化发展的道路上稳步前进。他们派遣间谍、特务、破坏者、暗杀者到这些国家里去。因此社会主义阵营的劳动人民必须更加警惕，防备帝国主义战争贩子的侵入。
    本期刊载的其他重要文章有：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席团委员阿·契皮茨卡的“论人民民主国家的阶级斗争”、英国共产党总书记哈·波立特的“伟大的斯大林思想的鼓舞作用”，危地马拉劳动党中央委员会书记阿·盖拉·波吉斯的“危地马拉劳动党第二次代表大会的成绩”。
    契皮茨卡的文章指出：欧洲人民民主国家的社会主义建设，是在阶级斗争日益尖锐的情况下进行的。契皮茨卡论述了在帝国主义侵略者指使下的卖国的资产阶级反动派和帝国主义者的特务、间谍阴谋瓦解共产党、夺取政权和恢复资本主义的情形以及他们的失败。契皮茨卡还论述了思想战线上的阶级斗争和无产阶级专政时代阶级斗争的主要形式之一——培养新的劳动纪律。
    契皮茨卡指出：苏联劳动人民进行阶级斗争的经验，以及各人民民主国家里阶级斗争的过程充分证实了：在从资本主义过渡到社会主义期间，阶级斗争并没有熄灭或者削弱，相反地，却是炽热起来了，越来越尖锐了。苏联的经验和帮助对于人民民主国家劳动人民在阶级斗争中取得胜利具有难以估价的意义。他们从这些经验中学到了与阶级敌人作斗争和取得胜利的方法。苏联的帮助和支持使他们能够胜利地解决一切困难并克服一切障碍。假如没有苏联的存在的话，毫无疑问，帝国主义者会像在十月革命以后一样组织联合的干涉，反对人民民主国家。人民民主国家依靠着苏联的强大力量走向社会主义，这是在反对国内外敌人的剧烈斗争中的一个决定因素。阶级斗争的日益尖锐要求共产党和工人党提高革命警惕性。麻痹大意是最危险的，因为它是从胜利后的骄傲自满中产生的。契皮茨卡在谈到思想战线斗争时指出：我们必须加强劳动人民的共产主义教育。在阶级斗争日益尖锐的情况下，特别重要的是：以马克思列宁主义的精神、高度的政治警惕性和社会主义的爱国主义精神来教育党员和全体劳动人民，培养对于人民民主国家和苏联的热爱和忠诚。契皮茨卡还指出：在培养新的劳动纪律中，党和国家要把说服人民作为自己的主要武器。必须保证使每个劳动人民确信没有自觉的纪律就不能建设社会主义。
    波立特的文章以英国的具体事实证明了斯大林关于现代资本主义基本经济法则的天才定义的正确性，并以英国和苏联的具体事实把现代资本主义社会和社会主义社会作了对比。波立特还着重指出：我们英国必须从苏联共产党第十九次代表大会得出的一个原则性的结论就是：需要加强英国共产党。英国共产党人从苏共第十九次代表大会取得的另一个重要教训，就是一定要更广泛地运用批评和自我批评的武器。
    盖拉·波吉斯的文章介绍了危地马拉劳动党第二次代表大会的情况和成绩。这次大会批判了危地马拉劳动党内一部分党员对危地马拉当前革命的性质和革命领导权问题的错误看法。大会通过的政治路线和党纲对党提出了充分发展反封建、反帝国主义革命的任务。　（新华社）
