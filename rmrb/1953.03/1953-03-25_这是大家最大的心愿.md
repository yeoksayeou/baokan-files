This is Everyone's Greatest Wish
Gao Jianping

One day in February, before dawn, the sound of gongs and drums echoed throughout the streets of Jiujiang. This was the enthusiastic scene of the whole city welcoming the volunteer soldiers, wounded and sick returning from Korea, to Jiujiang for recuperation, with the utmost respect and unparalleled warmth.

The street windows were filled with red flags, and the streets were packed with people. The riverside was even more lively, with motorcade, rickshaw teams, stretcher teams, yangko dance teams, flower-offering teams, and tea-serving teams, one after another. Men, women, old, and young, people spontaneously formed a welcoming crowd of more than ten thousand people. One-fifth of the city's population turned out.

The ship carrying the wounded and sick soldiers docked. The crowd surged. The wounded and sick soldiers had just received condolences from representatives of all walks of life, personally led by the city leaders, and were surrounded, hugged, carried, and lifted onto cars, rickshaws, and stretchers, one by one holding flowers, passing from the riverside through the streets to the sanatorium in the sound of drums, gongs, songs, firecrackers, and cheers.

Since hearing that a group of volunteer soldiers, wounded and sick, were coming to Jiujiang for recuperation, Jiujiang City had already launched a publicity campaign. People discussed how to continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and how to welcome the most beloved people.

It was the first time ever for residents of Jiujiang City to carry stretchers, but each street group scrambled to do so. The first district originally planned to have forty stretchers, but sixty registered to carry them. Originally, those assigned to carry the stretchers were male residents, but women also competed to carry them. Young people said, "We have good strength and can carry them," but older people suggested, "Our steps are steady, ensuring that the most beloved people will not be jostled." It was with great difficulty that the roster of the stretcher team was finalized.

Where to find the stretchers? Residents raised their hands and said, "We will take care of it ourselves." So, wicker chairs, bamboo chairs, canvas chairs, coir beds, bamboo beds, and wire beds were all tied up completely in less than an afternoon. Everyone thought of another problem: Wouldn't the stretchers be too hard, making the wounded and sick soldiers uncomfortable lying on them? So, people went home and brought quilts, mattresses, and blankets. Some brought their cherished silk quilts, and some even brought their wedding bedding.

Everything was prepared, and everyone waited like they were waiting for relatives.

The good news they had been waiting for finally arrived. As soon as the street government announced it, the residents' groups immediately became lively. The night before the wounded and sick soldiers arrived, the residents reminded each other to get up early. Many people were so happy that they couldn't sleep, and shouted out before dawn. You called me, and I called you, even those who usually loved to sleep in got up early today. Boiling water, cooking, making beds, testing stretchers, bustling in and out, everyone seemed to be celebrating a happy occasion.

A light rain began to fall, and everyone said, "The most beloved people suffered in the battlefield, can we let them get rained on again?" So, those with umbrellas, oilcloth, and raincoats all came. Some took off their own raincoats and put them over the stretchers.

Many young people guarded the winter defenses at night. When people told them to rest, they all said, "When the volunteer soldiers fought on the front lines, they often didn't eat or sleep for days and nights. What is it to me to have stayed up only one night?" Tao Fengxiang, an eighteen-year-old Hui boy, guarded the winter defenses all night, carried a stretcher in the morning, and still went to night school in the evening. When people asked him if he was tired, Tao Fengxiang said, "When I think that this is a glorious task, I don't feel tired."

Thousands of people have a common request: to meet the most beloved people and do something for the most beloved people. This is everyone's greatest wish.

    这是大家最大的心愿
    高剑萍
    二月间的一天，天还没有亮，九江市的街道上就到处响起了锣鼓。这是全市人民以崇高的敬意和无比的热情来迎接从朝鲜归来的志愿军伤病员到九江休养的热烈情景。
    街窗飘满了红旗，街上挤满了群众。江滨更是热闹，汽车队、人力车队、担架队、秧歌队、献花队、茶水队，一队接着一队。男的、女的、老的、少的，人们自动地组成了万人以上的欢迎队伍。全市人口的五分之一都出动了。
    载运伤病员的船靠拢了码头。人们哄动起来了。伤病员们刚刚接受了由市首长亲自率领的各界代表的慰问，就被人们簇拥着、抱着、背着、抬着，抬上了汽车、人力车和担架，一个个手抱鲜花，在鼓声、锣声、歌声、鞭炮声、欢呼声中，从江滨经过大街涌到休养地。
    自从听说有一批志愿军伤病员要来九江休养，九江市早就展开了宣传工作。人们讨论着要怎样继续加强抗美援朝的工作，要怎样来迎接最可爱的人。
    九江市居民抬担架还是破天荒第一次，但各街组都抢着要抬。第一区原定要担架四十付，但是认抬的有六十付。原定抬担架的都是男的居民，但女的也争着要抬。年青人说，我们力气好，抬得动；年纪大些的却提出：我们步子稳，保证不让最可爱的人受颠簸。好容易才确定了担架队的名册。
    担架到那儿去找呢？居民们举起手来说：“我们自己负责。”于是藤椅、竹椅、帆布椅、棕床、竹床、钢丝床，不到一个下午，都绑扎齐全了。大家又想起了一个问题：担架硬梆梆的，伤病员躺在上面不难受吗？于是，人们就回家去抱来了被子、褥子、毯子。有的人拿来了自己珍爱的丝棉被，有的人把结婚的被褥也拿出来了。
    一切都预备好了，大家都像盼望亲人一样盼望着。
    盼望的好消息终于来到了，街政府一传达，居民组马上就热闹起来。伤病员们到达的前一个夜晚，居民们，彼此关照要早点起来。很多人高兴得睡不着，不等天亮就喊起来了。你喊我，我喊你，连平常爱睡懒觉的今天也起早了。烧水，做饭，铺被子，试担架，忙进忙出，大家好像办喜事一样。
    毛毛雨下开了，大家都说：“最可爱的人在战场上吃了苦，现在还能叫他再淋到雨吗？”于是拿伞的，拿油布的，拿雨衣的都来了。有的人从自己身上把雨衣脱下来盖到担架上。
    很多青年晚上守了冬防，人家让他们休息，他们都说：“志愿军在前线战斗时，常常是几天几夜不吃不睡，我仅仅熬了一夜算什么？”十八岁的回族小伙子陶凤祥，守了一夜冬防，早上抬担架，晚上还赶上夜校，大家问他累不累。陶凤祥说：“我一想到这是个光荣的任务，就不累了。”
    千万人都有一个共同要求：和最可爱的人见见面，给最可爱的人做一点事，这是大家最大的心愿。
