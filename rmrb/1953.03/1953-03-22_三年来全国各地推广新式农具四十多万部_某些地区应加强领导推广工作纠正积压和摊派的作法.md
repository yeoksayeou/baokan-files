According to incomplete statistics, in the past three years, 22 provinces (municipalities) and regions across the country have promoted 12 types of new agricultural implements, totaling 400,529 units (including 225,530 various types of new walking plows); the Northeast Administrative Region has also promoted 600 sets of complete new sets of horse-drawn agricultural implements.

New agricultural implements are a symbol of new productive forces and an important factor in improving agricultural productivity. Facts have proven that regions that have truly leveraged the effectiveness of new agricultural implements have harvested more grain. In 1952, nine provinces and regions, including Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, and the suburbs of Beijing, conducted comparative tests of plowing with new and old plows for eleven major crops, proving that fields cultivated with new walking plows yielded an average of 16.8% more than fields cultivated with old plows. In the Northeast, where complete sets of new horse-drawn agricultural implements were used, higher yields were generally obtained due to improved farming techniques. According to statistics from six agricultural experiment stations and more than sixty agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, the yield of fields plowed with new plows was 25% to 30% higher than that of fields plowed with old plows, and in some cases, increased by more than one or two times.

The promotion of new agricultural implements has promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and has become an important material condition for the development and consolidation of mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives. In 1951, Jixian County, Songjiang Province, had only 64 relatively advanced mutual aid teams. As the number of new agricultural implements promoted increased, it increased to 368 in 1952, and three agricultural producers' cooperatives also emerged.

However, in the past three years, due to the lack of understanding of the importance of promoting new agricultural implements by some cadres responsible for the work, errors such as the large-scale stockpiling of new agricultural implements and the mandatory distribution of new agricultural implements to farmers have occurred. Last year, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation ordered 14,000 new walking plows from the Tianjin United Machinery Factory and distributed them to the joint venture cooperatives in various districts and counties for promotion and sales. Because the supply and marketing cooperatives did not publicize and promote them to the masses, only two or three thousand units were sold. Last year, Shaanxi Province promoted 40,250 new walking plows, and 7,617 units could not be installed and could not be used at all. Last year, Ningxia Province promoted only 7,000 new walking plows, but because the technology was not taught to the masses, some were still unused at the end of last year in Yinchuan Wu Township, near the guidance station. In Shanxi Province, where promotion work started earlier, there were also some places where forced orders, distribution by household, and failure to impart technology occurred in the promotion of new agricultural implements, so that the masses placed new walking plows on the edge of the fields to "stand guard."

Poor quality of new agricultural implements and difficulty in repairing and replacing damaged parts are also important reasons why new agricultural implements are not easily promoted. Last year, the Sun Yongqian mutual aid team in the Eleventh District of Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, borrowed a double-wheeled single-share plow, and only plowed more than ten *mu* of land before three plowshares were worn out. Sometimes the plowshare was bent and had to be straightened with an ax, which delayed the progress of the work. Last year, the Zhu Jinglin mutual aid team in the Fourteenth District bought a new set of horse-drawn agricultural implements, and the parts were damaged after only plowing two *mu* of land in the autumn. Because there was no place to repair and replace them locally, they had to be sent to the iron factory in Jiaohe County to repair and replace them, which was delayed for more than twenty days. When they were repaired and brought back, the ground was already frozen.

The spring plowing season has now arrived, and all localities should carefully examine and correct the shortcomings and errors in the promotion of new agricultural implements in the past. First, thoroughly change the bureaucratic and coercive style in the promotion of new agricultural implements. The experience of various localities in the past three years has proven that the leadership cadres attach importance to and strengthen the leadership of the promotion work, and patiently educate the farmers with practical examples, so that they truly understand the benefits of new agricultural implements and voluntarily request to use new agricultural implements, which is the key to doing a good job in the promotion of new agricultural implements. Last year, Zhaoyuan County, Shandong Province, first handed over the promotion work to a small number of business cadres, and it took five months to promote only 36 new walking plows. Later, the secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the county magistrate led 180 district and township cadres and county and district supply and marketing cooperative cadres to learn the technology of using new walking plows, deeply mobilized the masses, and proposed to the masses to ensure that they would teach the technology, ensure that the new agricultural implements were easy to use, and ensure that they would be allowed to return them. Because the masses recognized the benefits of new agricultural implements and knew how to use them, the promotion work was carried out smoothly. In more than twenty days, more than 700 new walking plows were promoted.

Second, strengthen technical guidance. This is the central issue in promotion work. All key promotion counties and districts can seize the spring plowing season and adopt methods such as typical demonstrations and holding training courses to impart technology. Cultivate technicians in mutual aid teams to make technology take root among the masses. The technical guidance stations in various localities should regard teaching the masses how to use new agricultural implements as a very important task.

Third, the promotion of new agricultural implements should be closely integrated with the mutual aid and cooperation movement. First of all, it should be clear that the main target of the promotion of new agricultural implements is organized farmers. Each set of complete new horse-drawn agricultural implements can cultivate 1,000 to 1,200 *mu* of land and requires large plots, strong animal power, and a lot of manpower to give full play to its effectiveness. Therefore, it can only be promoted to agricultural producers' cooperatives and relatively advanced mutual aid teams. Each new walking plow can cultivate 80 to 100 *mu* of land, and it is also advisable to promote them to mutual aid teams. Mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives with new agricultural implements are also easy to develop, consolidate, and improve.

    三年来全国各地推广新式农具四十多万部
    某些地区应加强领导推广工作纠正积压和摊派的作法
    根据不完全的统计，三年来全国二十二个省（市）区，已推广十二种新式农具共四十万零五百二十九部（其中包括各种新式步犁二十二万五千五百三十部）；东北行政区并推广了成套的新式马拉农具六百套。
    新农具是新的生产力的标志，是提高农业生产力的重要因素。事实证明，凡是真正发挥了新式农具的效能的地区，就多打了粮食。一九五二年陕西、河南、山东和北京市郊区等九个省区进行了十一种主要农作物的新旧犁耕作对比试验，证明使用新式步犁耕种的田，比使用旧犁耕种的田平均增产百分之十六点八。东北使用成套新式马拉农具的地方，由于改进了农作技术，更普遍地获得了高额产量。据六个农事试验场和六十多个农业生产合作社、互助组的统计，用新犁耕种的田的产量要比用旧犁耕种的田的产量多百分之二十五到三十，有的增加一两倍以上。
    新式农具的推广促进了互助合作运动的发展，成为发展、巩固互助组、农业生产合作社的重要物质条件。松江省集贤县一九五一年只有较高级的互助组六十四个，随着新式农具推广数量的增加，一九五二年就增加到三百六十八个，还出现了三个农业生产合作社。
    可是，三年来由于某些负责农具推广工作的干部对推广新式农具工作的重要意义认识不足，曾经发生了大批积压新式农具和向农民强迫摊派新式农具的错误。去年河北省供销联营总社订购了天津联合机器厂一万四千部新式步犁，分配给各专区、县联营社推销，因为供销合作社不向群众宣传推广，结果只推销了两三千部。去年陕西省推广了新式步犁四万零二百五十部，有七千六百十七部因为安装不起来，根本不能使用。宁夏省在去年仅推广了七千部新式步犁，但因没有把技术教给群众，就在指导站附近的银川五乡，在去年年底还有一些没有使用。在推广工作开展得较早的山西省，也有些地方在推广新式农具工作中发生强迫命令、按户摊派、不传授技术等现象，以致群众把新式步犁放在地边“站岗”。
    新式农具质量差，零件损坏了不易修配，也是新式农具不易推广的一个重要原因。吉林省蛟河县十一区孙永谦互助组去年贷用了双轮一铧犁，只翻了十多垧地就磨秃了三个犁尖，有时犁尖耕弯了，只得用斧头打直，耽误了工作的进行。十四区朱景林互助组去年新买了一套新式马拉农具，在秋天只耕了二垧地就坏了零件。因当地没处修配，只得送到蛟河县城的铁工厂去修配，前后耽搁了二十多天，修好取回时地已上冻了。
    目前春耕时期已经到来，各地应认真检查、纠正过去在推广新式农具工作中的缺点和错误。第一，彻底改变在推广新式农具工作中的官僚主义和强迫命令的作风。三年来各地经验证明，领导干部重视和加强对于推广工作的领导，以实际事例耐心教育农民，使他们真正认识新式农具的好处，自愿要求使用新式农具，这是做好新式农具推广工作的关键。去年山东省招远县先把推广工作交给少数业务干部去做，五个月才推广了三十六部新式步犁。后来中共招远县委书记和县长带领全县一百八十名区乡干部、县、区供销合作社干部学会使用新式步犁的技术，深入发动群众，向群众提出保证教会技术，保证新农具好使，保证准予退回，群众因为认识了新式农具的好处，又会使用了，推广工作就开展得顺利。二十多天中就推广了七百多部新式步犁。
    第二，加强技术指导。这是推广工作中的中心问题。凡是重点推广的县、区，可抓住春耕季节，采取典型示范和举办训练班等办法传授技术。在互助组中，培养技术员，使技术在群众中扎根。各地的技术指导站，应把教会群众使用新式农具的技术，当作一件非常重要的工作。
    第三，要把新式农具推广工作和互助合作运动密切结合起来。首先，应该明确新式农具推广的主要对象是组织起来的农民。成套的新式马拉农具每套可以耕种一千到一千二百亩地，需要地块大，畜力强，人力多，才能发挥它的效用，因此只有推广给农业生产合作社和较高级的互助组才能使用。新式步犁每部可耕种八十到百亩田，也以推广给互助组使用为宜。互助组、农业生产合作社有了新式农具也容易发展巩固和提高。
