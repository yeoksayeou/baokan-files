Jilin Province Yongji County's Marriage Law Implementation Committee trained district and village cadres from February 24th to 28th. 1,409 people participated in the training (in addition to district and village cadres, 32 model couples also participated). The training focused on positive education, using reports from exemplary figures to repeatedly explain the nature, purpose, guiding principles, and methods of the Marriage Law implementation movement. Through this training, district and village cadres truly recognized the importance of the Marriage Law implementation movement and, ideologically, initially distinguished the boundaries between the feudal marriage system and the new democratic marriage system.

Before training the cadres, a forum was first held to deeply understand the cadres' ideological situation. It was understood that these cadres' thoughts were confused. For example, some people had beaten their wives, arranged marriages for their children, interfered with others' freedom of marriage, or engaged in incorrect relationships between men and women in the past, so they were afraid of self-criticism in front of the masses and feared being punished. Some people mistakenly believed rumors that "the Marriage Law has changed, men can only marry at 25 and women at 23," and feared that promoting the Marriage Law would "disrupt the village," and lead to "more divorces" and "affect production." A few unmarried cadres dared not promote it, fearing that people would say they "want to find a partner." Some people also wanted to make some regulations during the study, like during the "suppression of counter-revolutionaries," so that they could "handle" a few after returning to the village. They thought: "It won't work if you don't arrest a few, you have to kill one to warn a hundred." Based on this situation, at the beginning of the training, a report was first made to the district and village cadres, explaining the nature, purpose, guiding principles, and methods of this Marriage Law implementation movement, focusing on dispelling ideological concerns and explaining policies. In this way, the cadres were relieved, and their learning enthusiasm stabilized.

After the general meeting report, group discussions were held by district. At the beginning, many people did not speak, or else they recited the articles: "This movement is a democratic reform within the people..." Some people also revealed in their speeches that their patriarchal ideas were very serious, such as when someone criticized beating his wife as wrong, he said, "Women, you have to beat them, if you don't beat them, they will shit on your head." Most people like to raise specific questions: such as someone asked, "What if they get married without registering?" In short, all kinds of questions were raised, and the ideas were very disorganized. Therefore, it is very important to guide the masses to grasp the key issues for discussion. The instructors in charge of the meeting should affirm the correct opinions, criticize or explain the incorrect ones, and be good at raising some specific issues to the level of principle for research, especially in light of the actual situation to inspire district and village cadres to discuss and understand the basic spirit of the Marriage Law. The discussion topics should be popular, such as what is the nature of the movement, and ask, "What is this movement about?" The discussion result was: "It is the people's own business, not a struggle against the enemy!" So everyone naturally started talking about their own and their village's affairs. For example, someone said: "In our village, the old Zhang family, the man and woman are not in harmony, the woman is abused, often wants to commit suicide, and the man doesn't produce well either, the whole family is uneasy." Everyone asked in the discussion:
	"Is it okay if this problem is not solved?" Someone said: "No!"
	"We must educate them, so that the husband and wife can respect and love each other, unite and produce, and build a democratic and harmonious happy family." In this way, people who were afraid that promoting the Marriage Law would disrupt the relationship between men and women and affect production in the past have changed their views, and many people said: "In the past, we promoted the Marriage Law in a rough way, only knowing how to talk about equality between men and women, and freedom of divorce and marriage, but we didn't know that promoting the Marriage Law is to make the family harmonious, to do a good job in production, and to live a good life. If we had known it was like this earlier, who wouldn't want to promote it, who would say it is a 'divorce law'!" Even more people said: "If we can reconcile the families that often fight, they will definitely give us a thumbs-up (meaning praise and support)." Many village cadres realized the benefits of promoting the Marriage Law through discussion and increased their confidence.

After more than a day of discussion, the confused ideas of the district and village cadres were initially clarified, and the purpose of implementing the Marriage Law was clarified. But at this time, they were not very clear about the disadvantages of the old marriage system and the advantages of the new marriage system. Based on this situation, the leadership decided to have eight people, including model couples, harmonious families, and model cadres, make typical reports at the general meeting, to show the village cadres what it looks like, and compare the old and the new. Doing so gave the cadres a deep impression, and the effect was also the greatest. The typical report conference solved three problems for the district and village cadres: First, the advantages of the new marriage system were clarified. Li Shuyun and Xin Yuzhi married freely. After marriage, the couple's relationship was very good, they respected and loved each other, labored and produced, challenged each other, the man became a model, and the woman also became a model, the family was harmonious, and they lived a good life, which everyone envied. After listening to their reports, the district and village cadres realized the benefits of freedom of marriage and equality between men and women. Second, it was clearly recognized that abolishing the old marriage system does not mean breaking up all old-fashioned marriages. Most old-fashioned arranged marriages can be transformed into harmonious families. The typical reports of Song Shuqin and Li Suzhi instilled such a specific concept in the cadres. When Li Suzhi was thirteen years old, her father arranged her marriage with Qu Yuncheng in Erdaogou. She got married at the age of seventeen. After Li Suzhi got married, she didn't have a good relationship with her husband and didn't feel like working all day. Her sister-in-law and brother were also arranged by their parents, and their relationship was not harmonious. They often fought, making the whole family awkward, no one got along with anyone, and the family's land was abandoned for two years, no one looked after it, and as a result, they owed more than 30 stone of grain. Last year, Li Suzhi participated in the party rectification study and realized the benefits of husband and wife respecting and loving each other, laboring and producing, and building a democratic and harmonious family. After returning home, she first self-criticized her mistakes to the whole family and also educated her sister-in-law. Now the whole family is very harmonious and has made a production plan, and each person has made a specific division of labor. After hearing her report, the cadres said:
	"In the past, we were afraid that promoting the Marriage Law would lead to more divorces, but now we understand that the Marriage Law can also turn old and disharmonious families into new and harmonious families, and our promotion must also be done in this way." Third, after hearing the model deeds of Wang Yurong, the secretary of the Zengtong Village Party Branch, the village cadres all made self-criticisms in connection with themselves. The secretary of the Xinlitu Village Party Branch checked himself and said: "In the past, not only did I not value the promotion of the Marriage Law like Wang Yurong, but I also interfered with widows remarrying, all of which were feudal thoughts at work in my mind." After the typical figure reports, Liu Ren, the secretary of the county party committee, made a concluding speech. In his report, he further clarified the benefits of the new marriage system and the disadvantages of the old marriage system to everyone through specific figures, and emphasized that the Marriage Law is related to men, women, old and young. Implementing the Marriage Law is not to punish anyone, but to use education methods to eliminate the feudal thoughts of the masses.

Before the end of the training class, Liu Ren, the secretary of the county party committee, made a summary report. In his report, in addition to emphasizing that education is the best way to solve ideological problems, he also assigned work to district and village cadres: ① After the cadres return, they must tell the masses that the Marriage Law has not changed (to stabilize the masses' emotions and combat rumors) when they enter the village and enter the door, and promote the basic spirit of implementing the Marriage Law is not to advocate divorce, nor is it that people with problems must be punished, and must be explained clearly to the masses. ② Hold a party branch meeting to convey the learning content of the training class to the party members, and discuss it. The branch should finally check the implementation of the Marriage Law in the past, and then hold various representative meetings to convey and discuss it among the organized masses. After the district cadres return, they should combine with the provincial and county work teams to do typical experiments in one village to find out the experience and promote it throughout the district. ③ Hold a forum for military families, at which model military families who actively produce and encourage their husbands to bravely kill the enemy can make reports, and call on military families to learn from them. ④ Discover and cultivate various types of model figures, harmonious families, model military families, model cadres, etc. Then, based on the typical experimental experience of the district and the strength of the cadres, conduct in-depth publicity or comprehensively spread it in stages. When promoting it, it should be combined with production to achieve the goal that everyone knows it.

    吉林省永吉县组织区村干部学习婚姻法的经验
    吉林省永吉县贯彻婚姻法运动委员会在二月二十四日到二十八日集训了区村干部。参加受训的有一千四百零九人（除区村干部外，还有模范夫妇三十二人参加）。在训练中着重进行了正面教育，通过典型人物报告，反复地讲解了贯彻婚姻法运动的性质、目的、方针和作法。经过这次训练，区村干部真正认识到贯彻婚姻法运动的重要性，并从思想上初步划清了封建婚姻制度与新民主主义婚姻制度的界限。
    集训干部之前，首先召开了座谈会，深入了解了干部的思想情况。据了解，这些干部的思想是混乱的。如有些人过去打过老婆、包办过儿女亲事、干涉过别人婚姻自由、乱搞过不正确的男女关系等，因此怕在群众面前检讨，怕受处分。有些人误信谣言，认为“婚姻法变了，男二十五、女二十三才能结婚”，怕宣传婚姻法“把村子搞乱”、“离婚的更多”，“影响生产”；少数没有结婚的干部则不敢宣传，怕人家说自己“要搞对象”。还有些人想在学习中订几条规定，像“镇压反革命”时一样，回村好
    “处理”几个。他们认为：“不抓起几个不顶事，要杀一儆百。”根据这种情况，在集训开始时，首先对区村干部作了报告，讲解了这次贯彻婚姻法运动的性质、目的、方针和作法，着重打破思想顾虑，交代政策。这样，干部安下了心，学习情绪稳定了。
    大会报告以后，以区为单位分小组进行讨论。开始时，许多人不发言，不然就背诵条文：“这个运动是人民内部的民主改革……。”也有些人从发言中暴露出夫权思想很严重，如别人检讨打老婆不对时，他却说：“女人，你就得打她，不打她，她就上你脖子顶上拉屎。”大部分人爱提具体问题：如有人提“不登记就结婚怎么办？”总之，什么问题都提，头绪很乱，因此，引导群众抓住关键问题进行讨论是非常重要的。掌握会场的辅导员要把正确的意见加以肯定，不正确的加以批判或解释，要善于把一些具体问题提到原则上来研究，特别要联系实际情况启发区村干部讨论和领会婚姻法的基本精神。讨论题目要通俗，如运动的性质是什么，就提“这次运动是怎么回事？”讨论结果是：“是人民自己的事，不是斗争敌人！”于是大家自然地扯起本村的和自己的事来。如有人说：“咱村老张家，男女不和，女的受虐待，经常要寻死上吊，男的也不好好生产，一家老少都不安。”大家在讨论时就问：
    “这问题不解决行么？”有人就说：“不行！”
    “要教育，要使他们夫妻都能互敬互爱、团结生产，建立民主和睦的幸福家庭。”这样，过去怕宣传婚姻法搞乱了男女关系、影响生产的人都转变了看法，不少人说：“过去咱们宣传婚姻法囫囵半片，只懂得讲男女平等，离婚、结婚自由，那知道宣传婚姻法是要家庭和睦，搞好生产，把日子过好。早知道是这样，谁还不愿意宣传，谁还能说是‘离婚法’呢！”更有的人说：“我们要能把常打架的人家说合好，人家准给我们举大拇指头（称赞、拥护的意思）。”许多村干部通过讨论认识了宣传婚姻法的好处，提高了信心。
    经过一天多的讨论，初步澄清了区村干部的糊涂观念，明确了贯彻婚姻法的目的。但这时他们对旧婚姻制度的坏处和新婚姻制度的好处还不大明确。领导上根据这种情况，决定通过模范夫妻、和睦家庭、模范干部等八个人在大会上作典型报告，给村干部摆出样子，新旧对比一下。这样做，给干部的印象很深，效果也最大。通过典型报告大会给区村干部解决了三个问题：第一，新婚姻制度的好处明确了。李淑云和辛玉芝是自由结婚的，婚后夫妇感情非常好，互敬互爱，劳动生产，互相挑战，男的当了模范，女的也当了模范，家庭和睦，日子过得美好，人人都羡慕。区村干部听了他们的报告后，都认识到婚姻自由、男女平等的好处。第二，明确认识了废除旧婚姻制度，不是把旧式结婚的都拆散，多数旧式包办的婚姻，是可以改造成为和睦家庭的。宋淑琴、李素芝的典型报告就给干部灌输了这样一种具体的观念。李素芝在十三岁时，父亲就包办着给她和二道沟的曲运成订了婚。十七岁时结婚。李素芝结婚后与丈夫感情不够好，成天没心思干活。她的大嫂和大哥也是父母包办的，感情不和，常打架，弄得全家老少七扭八歪，谁和谁也合不来，家里的地足足扔了二年，无人侍弄，结果欠下三十多石粮的债。去年李素芝参加了整党学习，认识到夫妻互敬互爱，劳动生产，建立民主和睦家庭的好处，回家后首先向全家人检讨了自己的错误，并把嫂嫂也教育过来。现在全家非常和睦，并订了生产计划，每人又作了具体分工。干部听到她的报告后说：
    “过去怕宣传婚姻法离婚的多，现在可明白了，婚姻法还能使旧的不和的家庭变成新的和睦的家庭，我们宣传也要作到这样才行。”第三，村干部听到模范干部、曾通村党支部书记王玉荣的模范事迹后，都联系自己进行了检讨。新立屯村党支部书记检查自己说：“过去我不但不像王玉荣那样重视宣传婚姻法，还干涉寡妇改嫁，这都是封建思想在脑子里作怪。”典型人物报告以后，县委书记柳仁作了总结发言，他更进一步通过具体人物向大家讲清了新婚姻制度的好处和旧婚姻制度的坏处，并着重说明婚姻法对男女老少都有关系。贯彻婚姻法不是为了处分谁，而是要用教育的方法，消除群众的封建思想。
    训练班结束前，县委书记柳仁作了总结报告。他在报告中除着重讲解了教育是解决思想问题的最好方式外，还替区村干部布置了工作：①干部回去后，一进村、一进门遇到群众就要宣传婚姻法没有变（稳定群众情绪、打击谣言），宣传贯彻婚姻法的基本精神不是提倡离婚，也不是有问题的人都得受处分，都要向群众交代清楚。②开党支部会议，向党员传达训练班学习内容，并要讨论。支部最后要检查过去贯彻婚姻法的情况，然后分别召开各种代表会，在有组织的群众中传达、讨论。区干部回去后，要结合省县工作组到一个村作典型试验，找出经验推广全区。③开军属座谈会，会上可让积极生产、鼓励丈夫英勇杀敌的模范军属作报告，号召军属向她们学习。④发现与培养各种类型的模范人物、和睦家庭、模范军属、模范干部等。之后，再根据区典型试验经验和干部力量分片深入宣传或全面铺开。宣传时，要和生产结合起来，达到家喻户晓，人人皆知。
