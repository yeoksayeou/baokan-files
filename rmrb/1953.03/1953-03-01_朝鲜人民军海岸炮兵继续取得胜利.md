Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 27th - The Korean People's Army coastal artillery, vigilantly defending the coast of their homeland, continued to achieve victories in January by repelling invading enemy naval vessels. On the 27th, a unit of the enemy, aboard two motorboats and eleven wooden boats, intruded into the waters near a certain island in northern Korea, attempting to land stealthily. The coastal artillery company of the Korean People's Army defending the coast had long been preparing for battle. They closely monitored the enemy boats from the moment they came into sight. When the dispersed enemy boats approached to within several hundred meters, they opened fire in unison. A rain of shells exploded on and between the enemy boats. Amid the churning waves, some enemy boats were sunk before they could turn around, while others, after turning to flee, were hit by whistling shells. Plumes of fire and smoke rose continuously from the sea. Of the thirteen enemy boats, only five escaped sinking because they turned and ran as soon as the shelling began.

On January 8th, the Li Yong-guk coastal artillery company, defending a certain coast, also used accurate and fierce artillery fire to sink an invading enemy minesweeper and several other vessels. In the following week, they continued to sink another enemy minesweeper, three motorboats, and six wooden boats.

    朝鲜人民军海岸炮兵继续取得胜利
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】警惕地捍卫着祖国海岸的朝鲜人民军海岸炮兵，在一月间迎击来犯的敌舰艇，继续取得胜利。二十七日，敌军一部乘汽艇两艘、木船十一艘侵入朝鲜北部某岛附近的海面，企图偷偷登陆。防守该海岸的朝鲜人民军海岸炮中队早已作了战斗的准备。他们从敌船艇进入视线时起就紧紧地加以监视。等到分散驶进的敌船艇接近到数百公尺的距离时，他们就一齐发炮轰击。雨点似的炮弹在敌船艇上和敌船艇之间连连爆炸。在翻腾的海浪中，有些敌船来不及扭转身便被打沉了，有些敌船才回头逃出一段路，又碰上了呼啸着的炮弹。海面上不断地升起一股股的火烟。十三艘敌船艇中只有五艘因炮声一响回头便跑，才没有被打沉。
    一月八日，防守某海岸的李容国海岸炮中队也以准确猛烈的炮火，打沉了来犯的敌扫雷艇一艘和其他船只多艘。此后一星期中，他们又继续打沉了敌扫雷艇一艘、汽艇三艘、木船六艘。
