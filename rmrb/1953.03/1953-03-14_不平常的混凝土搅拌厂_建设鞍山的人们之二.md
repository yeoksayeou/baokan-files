An Unusual Concrete Mixing Plant
——People Building Anshan, Part Two
By Our Staff Reporter Lù Hào

“This concrete mixing plant seems ordinary enough. It simply replaces the manual concrete mixing work done on-site with machines. Or it changes the old habit of using mixers on-site to concentrating the machines together to establish a factory specializing in concrete mixing production.

“Many things seem simple in hindsight, but doing them is not that easy. It's not that the task is complex or difficult, but people's minds are sometimes like stubborn rocks, which can’t be penetrated no matter how much you hammer them.

“Speaking of this concrete mixing plant, Soviet expert Comrade Vichitov was already proposing it in the summer of 1950. As soon as he arrived in Anshan, he saw us raising sand and carrying stones with shovels and picks. We transported cement with shoulder poles and baskets. We mixed concrete by standing on iron plates and working with shovels, and the quality of the concrete was guaranteed by experience and eyesight. At that time, Comrade Vichitov saw the future construction of Anshan, and he saw that the concrete needed for future projects could not be handled by hand alone. So he personally led the design and drawing, requiring us to use machines for everything that could be done without manpower, and to concentrate production for anything that could be done that way, instead of doing it piecemeal. The leadership accepted his proposal and allocated 20 billion Northeast currency specifically for this work at the time. So, hand-cranked cranes were made, and iron handcarts were made. At that time, Lishan was building workers' residences, preparing to set up a mixing plant to mix mortar, and the concrete foundation for the plant base had begun.

“Mechanization and factory production were new issues for people who were only used to using manpower in a piecemeal way. Some said, ‘Our country has a large population and cheap labor. Using machines is more expensive than manpower due to the depreciation rate of the machines.’ Others said, ‘I'm not doing concrete work for the first time. If I'm afraid that manpower won't be enough, I'll put a few mixers on the site. I can use as many as I need, how convenient.’ Some people were even more pessimistic, saying, ‘It's too much trouble to do this. By the time your mixing plant is finished, our project will be completed.’ Among these people, some didn't understand machines and were used to handicraft methods, so of course, they wouldn't use scientific accounting. Some knew that mechanization and factory production were necessary but were afraid of trouble and afraid of learning. Some people acted according to their own experience, thinking that they could live off their few tricks forever.

“Later, Comrade Vichitov temporarily left Anshan. Due to the ideological resistance of many engineering and technical personnel, the work of construction mechanization and factory production was hindered. The iron handcarts and hand-cranked cranes that had been made had to lie in the warehouse, and the framework of the Lishan mixing plant, which had been 80 percent completed, was no longer urged or continued.

“This work dragged on until the autumn of 1951, when preparations for basic construction in Anshan began, and people remembered Comrade Vichitov's proposal again, and the concrete mixing plant. So the leadership made a determination to pick up the work that had been put aside and continue it. At that time, time was very pressing.

“Logically speaking, with the leadership's determination, this matter should be easy to handle, but at the beginning, there was a big problem with the mixer. Originally, our mixing plant's daily production task was 300 cubic meters, but now it was to be increased to 600 cubic meters per day. The originally prepared mixer was too small, and there was not enough time to make a new one. So, people were sent to Harbin, Fushun, Benxi, and everywhere to look for the large mixer we needed. In the end, Comrade Vichitov helped us solve the problem. At that time, he had already returned to Anshan. He often passed by the gate of the Municipal People's Government in his car. Once, he noticed two mixer heads exposed behind a short wall. He sent someone to check, and it turned out to be two large mixers. After running around everywhere, we couldn't find them. Actually, there were machines, but no one wanted to use them. The found machines were exposed to the sun and rain, and no one took care of them. Unfortunately, the parts were already incomplete.

“The mixers were found, but we were still missing parts and many auxiliary equipment. So, we ran around every day looking for these things. For example, we didn't have a belt conveyor. Without this kind of machine, we couldn't transport hundreds of tons of stones and sand into the mixer. After asking around, a worker told us that there were many parts lying idle in the warehouse of the refractory factory. We ran over there to take a look, and sure enough, there were these machines. We wrote a report to the finance department, and some comrades in the finance department said, ‘This is state-owned fixed assets, you can't use it casually.’ It's really strange. When no one was using it, they didn't think of it as state-owned assets. When we wanted to use it, they didn't help solve the problem, but said, ‘You can't move it.’ It seems that these state-owned assets can only lie there idle. Later, we found the leadership and got some parts of the belt conveyor from the warehouse. But we were still missing a reducer. The workers told us that they had seen it at the coal washing plant of the Ministry of Chemical Industry. Speaking of this is also very funny. The director of the Ministry of Chemical Industry had already said that we could have it. We ourselves also went to the coal washing plant and saw three reducers lying in a dark corner, but the planning department of the Ministry of Chemical Industry insisted, ‘We don't have this kind of machine.’ We said, ‘We have already seen it.’ They checked the books, and it wasn't in the books, but the reducer we are using now was really obtained from the coal washing plant.

“‘Piecing it together,’ we finally managed to put the machines of the mixing plant together. Everyone was waiting to see us test the machine. At this time, the mixer machine was really like it was installed in our hearts, both nervous and happy. But when we tested the machine, things went wrong. The three-story steel frame shook violently when the machine vibrated, and several gears on the mixer also fell off with a bang. Seeing this situation, our heads went numb. And some engineers said sarcastic remarks again. Saying something like: I knew you were taking risks, others are increasing production and practicing economy, you are just wasting. We trusted the leadership, trusted the Soviet experts, no one was discouraged, and continued to work hard. The frame was shaking, we asked the Soviet experts to calculate, he helped us add diagonal supports to the frame structure, replaced the new gears on the mixer, and finally we succeeded in the test run.

“The mixer could run, but the amount of concrete we produced was still pitiful. At the beginning, we only produced a few cubic meters a day, and slowly it went up to ten or twenty cubic meters, which kept us busy. At that time, the main concrete projects were about to start one after another. We were not skilled in our work, and the concrete was produced in small quantities, which could not supply the site. In addition, the transportation was not well organized, so the cars were waiting for the concrete, and the concrete was waiting for the cars. It was really a mess.

“By July and August, the output of the mixing plant had gradually increased, but the engineers on the construction site still had no confidence in us. One construction site director asked us, ‘What is the maximum amount you can produce in a day?’ We calculated the conditions in all aspects and said, ‘We can produce a maximum of 500 cubic meters per day.’ He smiled and said, ‘Forget it, if you can produce 400 cubic meters, I will worship you as my teacher.’ Because he was not assured of us, he also wanted us to install a few mixers on the site to ensure the supply of concrete. Okay, let's install them, we ourselves didn't feel too confident. In September, we installed three mixers for them. As soon as these mixers were installed on the site, it became lively. The three machines were installed for seven days, producing more than 300 cubic meters of concrete every day, but thousands of tons of stones, sand, and cement were piled up on the site. The steel bars brought by the steel bar factory were piled in the sand, and the wooden boards from the formwork factory were also thrown everywhere. Three or four hundred truckloads of stones and sand had to be transported every day, and the roads were often blocked. This chaotic situation greatly affected other work. Facts have shown that the method of putting mixers on the site is not feasible for large-scale concrete projects. Later, these mixers had to be moved away quickly before the construction site returned to normal."

This assistant engineer, who speaks in an organized manner, is one of the active workers in preparing for the concrete mixing plant. His name is Chen Zuyao. More than three years ago, he was still a student in the Department of Architecture at Zhijiang University. Now he is wearing an oily cotton uniform. His thin face has a pair of very energetic eyes. From the wrinkles that have sunk on his young forehead and the long beard that often grows on the corners of his mouth, it is clear at a glance that the hard life on the construction site has given him serious training. Obviously, compared with a few years ago, he has become a quite experienced engineering and technical personnel.

"So, what is the situation of the mixing plant now?" I asked.

He answered me with a very excited and excited voice. From his voice, it can be known how great the joy this young man is holding. He said: "Now, our mixing plant has begun to attract attention. During the pouring project of the No. 11 foundation, our daily concrete production reached 1,000 cubic meters, and an average of 40 to 50 cubic meters had to be supplied per hour. In more than 70 hours, we continuously supplied 3,000 cubic meters to the No. 11 foundation. These concrete can load 240 train cars. In particular, the No. 11 foundation is a winter construction project. The 3,000 cubic meters of concrete need to be mixed with 450 tons of 90-degree hot water, 2,000 tons of sand need to be heated to 40 degrees, and 4,000 tons of stones below zero degrees need to be heated to six or seven degrees. Now everyone is saying: ‘Without the equipment of the mixing plant, it is impossible to cope with such a large amount of concrete used in the project, and winter construction is simply impossible.’ Now, no one can be heard saying that they are not interested in construction mechanization and factory production."

He is like a person who has won a battle. He deserves to be an active worker who firmly realizes mechanization and factory production in basic construction. (Attached photo)

    不平常的混凝土搅拌厂
    ——建设鞍山的人们之二
    本报记者　陆灏
    “这混凝土搅拌厂，说来很平常。它不过是把现场上用人力干的混凝土搅拌工作，改用机器代替。或者是把过去在现场上用搅拌机的老习惯，改成把机器集中在一起，成立一个专门进行混凝土搅拌生产的工厂。
      “有许多事情，在事后看来，很简单，但做起来，却不是那样容易。倒不是事情复杂难做，是人的思想，有时候像顽石一样，千打万锤，还是弄不通。
      “提起这混凝土搅拌厂，早在一九五零年的夏天，苏联专家维契托莫夫同志就已经提出了建议。他刚到鞍山，就看见我们起砂子抬石头，用的是铁锹镐头。运洋灰，是扁担加筐筐。搅拌混凝土，是站在铁板上用铁锹干活，混凝土的质量，是用经验和眼光来保证。维契托莫夫同志在那时候，就看到鞍山未来的建设，他看到将来工程上所需要的混凝土，决不是单靠两只手可以应付得了的。于是他就亲自领导设计、画图，要我们能不用人力的，都用机械；能集中生产的，不要零敲碎打。领导方面接受了他的建议，当时专门拨了二百亿东北币进行这个工作。于是，手摇起重机做好了，铁的手推车做出来了，那时，立山正在建筑工人住宅，准备设立一个搅拌厂搅拌灰浆，厂基的混凝土基础也开始了。
      “施工要机械化，要工厂化，这对只会零零碎碎使用人力的人来说，是个新问题。有的说：‘咱们的国家人多，劳动力便宜，用机器，机器的折旧率比人力还贵呢。’有的说：‘混凝土工程我又不是头一回干，怕人力来不及，弄几台搅拌机放在现场上，我要用几台，就用几台，多么方便。’有的人更悲观，他们说：‘搞这个多麻烦，你们的搅拌厂搞成了，我们的工程也可以做完了。’这些人里头，有的是不懂机器，用惯了手工业的办法，当然不会用科学算帐。有的是知道要干机械化、工厂化，怕麻烦，又怕学习。有的人是根据自己的经验办事，他以为自己这几手，一辈子就吃喝不完了。
    “后来，维契托莫夫同志暂时离开了鞍山。由于不少工程技术人员的思想上的抵抗，所以施工机械化和工厂化的工作受到了阻碍。已经做好的铁的手推车、手摇起重机，只好躺在仓库里，那立山搅拌厂的房架，做成了百分之八十，就再没有人催，也没有人继续做下去了。
      “这工作，一直拖到一九五一年的秋天，鞍山基本建设的准备工作开始进行，人们才又重新记起了维契托莫夫同志的建议，记起了混凝土搅拌厂。于是领导上下了决心，要把搁下来的工作，重新拾起来，继续进行。当时时间就很急迫了。
    “按理说，领导方面有了决心，这事就好办了，但一开始，搅拌机就发生了大问题。原来我们的搅拌厂，每天的生产任务是三百立方公尺，现在要提高到每天生产六百立方公尺，本来准备的搅拌机太小，要做新的，时间来不及。于是，派人到哈尔滨、抚顺、本溪，到处去找，结果还是找不到我们所要的大搅拌机。后来，还是维契托莫夫同志帮我们解决了问题。那时候他已经又回到了鞍山，他平时坐汽车，常常从市人民政府的门口经过，有一次，他发现在
    一座短墙的后头，露着两台搅拌机的脑袋，他派人一看，果然是两架大搅拌机。东奔西走找不见，其实是有机器，就是没有人想用，寻来的机器因为日晒雨淋，无人照管，可惜零件已经残缺不全了。
      “搅拌机找到了，还缺零件，还缺不少附属设备，于是我们就天天为找这些东西奔跑。譬如，我们没有皮带运输机，没有这种机器，就不能向搅拌机里输送成百吨的石头、砂子，到处打听，一个工人告诉我们说：有很多零件，现在闲着放在耐火厂的仓库里。我们跑到那边一看，果然有这些机器。我们写报告向财务科要，财务科有的同志说：‘这是国家固定资财，你们可不敢随便用。’说起来这真奇怪，没有人去用它，他们想不起这是国家资财；等到我们要用了，他们不是帮助解决，而是说：‘不能动。’好像这国家资财只能闲着躺在那里。后来，我们找到领导方面，才从仓库里拿来了皮带运输机上的一部分零件。但还缺少一个减速机，工人们又告诉我们去化工部的洗煤厂找见了它。说起这也很好笑，化工部主任已经说可以给我们，我们自己也到洗煤厂看到有三个减速机躺在暗暗的角落里，但化工部计划科一定说：‘我们没有这种机器。’我们说：‘我们已经看到了。’他们查帐，帐本上就是没有，但我们现在用的减速机，是实实在在从洗煤厂要来的。
      “‘七拼八凑’，我们总算把搅拌厂的机器凑好了。大家等着看我们试车。这时候，那搅拌机的机器，真像安在我们的心上一样，又紧张，又高兴。但一试车，事情糟了，那三层楼的钢铁房架，机器一震动，摇幌得厉害，搅拌机上的齿轮，也乒乓乒乓打掉了好几个，看到这情形，我们的头直发麻。而有些工程师他们又说风凉话了。说什么：我早知道你们是在冒险，别人在增产节约，你们偏偏在浪费。我们信任领导，信任苏联专家，谁也没有泄气，继续拼命干。房架摇动，我们请苏联专家来计算，他帮助我们在房架结构上加了斜支撑，搅拌机上换上了新齿轮，最后我们终于试车成功了。
      “搅拌机是能开动了，但我们出的混凝土的数量还是很可怜的。开头，一天不过出几立方公尺，慢慢出到一、二十立方公尺，就把我们忙坏了。那时间，主要的混凝土工程都快先后开工，我们工作不熟练，混凝土出得少，供不上现场用，再加运输没搞好，弄得汽车等混凝土，混凝土等汽车，真是乱糟糟。
    “到了七、八月份，搅拌厂的产量已经逐渐上升，但工地上的工程师们，对我们仍然没有信心。有一个工地主任问我们：‘一天最多能出多少？’我们计算了一下各方面的条件，说：‘最多每天能出五百立方公尺。’他笑着说：‘算了，能出四百立方公尺，我就拜你们为师。’他因为不放心我们，还要我们在现场上安几台搅拌机，保证混凝土的供应。好吧，安就安吧，我们自己觉得也没有太大把握，九月份，我们就给他们安了三台搅拌机。这搅拌机往现场上一安，可就热闹了，三台机器安了七天，每天出三百多立方公尺混凝土，但现场上就堆了成千吨的石头、沙子和洋灰，钢筋厂拿来绑好的钢筋，都被堆在砂子里头，木模厂的木板也丢得到处都是。一天运石头、砂子的汽车就要三、四百车次，道路也被常常堵死，这种混乱的情形，使别的工作都大受影响。事实说明，大规模的混凝土工程，把搅拌机放在现场上的办法是行不通的。后来，只有把这些搅拌机赶快挪走，工地上才恢复了正常的状态。”
    这个说起话来有条不紊的助理工程师，是筹备混凝土搅拌厂工作的积极工作者之一，他的名字叫陈祖尧。三年多以前他还是之江大学建筑系的学生，现在穿了一身油垢的棉制服，他的瘦削的脸孔上长着一双很有精神的眼睛，从他的年青的额上所陷下去的绉纹和他的嘴边常常生满了很长的胡子来看，可以一目了然地知道艰苦的工地生活给予他的严重的锻炼。很显然，和几年以前相比，他已经变成一个颇为老练的工程技术人员了。
    “那么，现在搅拌厂的情况怎样呢？”我问。
    他带着一种非常兴奋和激动的声音回答我，从他的声音里头可以知道这个年青人是怀着多么巨大的欣喜。他说：“现在，我们的搅拌厂就已经开始引人注意了。在十一号基础浇灌工程进行的时候，我们每天混凝土的产量达到了一千立方公尺，每小时要平均供给四、五十立方公尺，在七十多小时内，我们接连地供给了十一号基础三千立方公尺，这些混凝土，能装二百四十个火车皮。特别是，十一号基础是冬季施工，那三千立方公尺混凝土，要用四百五十吨九十度的热水搅拌，有二千吨的砂子要加热到四十度，有四千吨在零度以下的石头，要把它加热到六、七度。现在是谁也说：‘要没有搅拌厂这一套设备，工程上要用这样大量的混凝土，是没有法子应付的，冬季施工，就根本办不到。’现在，对施工机械化和工厂化，已经听不到有人再说没有兴趣了。”
    他真像是一个打了胜仗的人。他不愧是一个在基本建设中坚定地实现机械化和工厂化的积极工作者。（附图片）
