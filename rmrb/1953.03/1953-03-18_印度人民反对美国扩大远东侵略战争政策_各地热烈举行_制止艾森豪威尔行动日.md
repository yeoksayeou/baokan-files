    Rallies Held Enthusiastically in Various Places for "Stop Eisenhower Action Day"

    [Xinhua News Agency] People across India, responding to the call of the All-India Peace Council, held "Stop Eisenhower Action Day" on February 27.

    In Calcutta, the West Bengal Peace Council held a public gathering in the local university hall on this day. The gathering was chaired by Mukherjee, the chief writer of the Bengali newspaper "Yugantar." A resolution was passed at the meeting stating: The Indian people are deeply concerned about U.S. President Eisenhower's threats against China. He has struck a blow to the Indian people's desire for peace, security, and freedom. The resolution demanded that the Indian government immediately tell the U.S. President that the Indian people are united against U.S. war policies. The resolution demanded that the Indian government submit a proposal for an immediate ceasefire in Korea at the current United Nations conference. Amar Bose, a member of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, said at the meeting: The Indian people must stand with the Soviet Union and China to avoid the increasing U.S. threat to India. He said that if U.S. imperialism launched a war against China or the Soviet Union, every Indian must stand on the side of the Soviet Union and China. Benoy Chatterjee of the All-India Trade Union Congress, Bengal Branch, emphasized at the meeting that workers in West Bengal will never participate in any war that serves the interests of imperialism. When talking about his recent visit to China, writer Manoj Bose said: The Chinese people welcomed the Indian representatives as representatives of peace. The honor bestowed upon Indian representatives must be maintained. We should take steps to prevent imperialists from launching aggression against China.

    In various parts of West Bengal, activities for "Stop Eisenhower Action Day" were conducted very enthusiastically. The ongoing farmers' conferences in various parts of West Bengal, while passing resolutions on the demands of farmers, also passed resolutions opposing Eisenhower's war-mongering policies. Under the slogans of "We Don't Want War, We Want Peace," "Down with Imperialism's War-Mongering Policies," "Immediate Ceasefire in Korea," and "No Interference in China," rallies and parades were held in various places in West Bengal.

    In Assam and Tripura in the far east of India, public gatherings were held on this day to pledge to advance the peace movement and strengthen the struggle to defend world peace.

    In Jamshedpur, the industrial center of Bihar, the local Peace Committee, Cultural Association, Women's Welfare Association, and Democratic Youth Federation jointly held a public gathering on this day. A resolution was passed at the meeting demanding that the Indian government try to prevent the expansion of the Korean War, implement an unconditional ceasefire in Korea, and conclude a five-power peace pact.

    In Ghaziabad, an important railway junction thirty miles east of Delhi, the local Peace Committee held a public gathering in the local town hall on this day. The gathering was chaired by Dr. Jagdish Chandra. Speakers at the meeting included Hari Dutt, the chief writer of the Hindi newspaper "Naya Hindustan," and Ya. Du. Sharma. A meeting held in Jangpura (in the suburbs of Delhi) passed a resolution demanding that the Indian government respect the wishes of the Indian people and urge the United States to sign a five-power peace pact. Ya. Du. Sharma, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India, said at the meeting: Peace-loving people all over the world will crush the war conspiracy of using Asians to fight Asians pursued by U.S. war-mongers. Indian Member of Parliament Chatur Narain Malaviya said: The Chinese people hope to live in friendship with the Indian people. He said that based on what he saw in China, he was convinced that the United States had engaged in germ warfare. He denounced the recent measures announced by Eisenhower regarding Taiwan, saying that peace-loving people all over the world would oppose and crush this aggressive conspiracy.

    Various parts of East Punjab Province – Jullundur, Ludhiana, Moga in Ferozepore District, Chheharta (an industrial area outside Amritsar), as well as other cities and villages – held "Stop Eisenhower Action Day."

    In Madhya Pradesh, a public gathering was held in Nagpur on this day. Thakur Pyarelal Singh, a member of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly, said at the meeting: The people should clearly understand that the current U.S. President is trying to drag the whole world into a third world war and rule the Asian people by making them kill each other. Therefore, he called on the people to oppose war and boycott U.S. goods.

    In Hyderabad City, the local Peace Committee held a public gathering on this day. The gathering was chaired by the former Chief Justice of Hyderabad, Nazir Yar Jang. The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the Indian government warn the U.S. government that any attempt to attack China would be considered U.S. aggression. The gathering issued an appeal calling on the people to do everything possible to crush Eisenhower's dangerous plans, demanding an immediate end to the Korean War and the conclusion of a five-power pact. On this day, similar gatherings were also held in various cities and villages of Hyderabad State.

    [Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 17th] The people of Madras Province, India, are holding "Stop Eisenhower Action Week" from March 7th to 15th. During this week, the Madras Province Peace Committee organized various rallies demanding a ceasefire in Korea and opposing the wars waged by imperialists in Malaya and Vietnam.

    In a statement calling for the holding of "Stop Eisenhower Action Week," the Madras Province Peace Committee said that the people of Madras, together with the people of all India, oppose Eisenhower's war policies. The statement said:

    "Just as peace-loving people all over the world are anxiously hoping to stop the slaughter and hostilities in Korea, President Eisenhower has blatantly stated his intention to expand the war in the Far East in a policy statement on China and the Far East." The statement continued: The expansion of the war "will bring death and indescribable suffering to millions of people, especially in Asia. As far as India is concerned, the expansion of the war will not only cause great difficulties for our economy, but will also directly threaten the security and sovereignty of our motherland itself."

    The statement pointed out: "Behind Ike's policy is a vicious plan to use Asians to fight Asians. With this aim in mind, the United States is rearming Japan and Taiwan, turning them into actual barracks. The sole purpose of the United States is to make Asians kill each other, their own brothers. We remember very well that the United States used Asians as guinea pigs to test the effects of atomic bombs and germ bombs."

    The statement said: "In the face of such a war threat, the task of all Asian people is to unite and form a strong peace front to oppose Ike's war aims."

    【新华社讯】印度全国各地人民响应全印和平理事会的号召，于二月二十七日举行“制止艾森豪威尔行动日”。
    在加尔各答，西孟加拉和平理事会这一天在当地大学大厅中举行公众集会。集会由孟加拉文日报“划时代报”主笔慕克吉担任主席。会上通过决议说：印度人民对美国总统艾森豪威尔威胁中国的做法深感忧虑。他打击了印度人民要求和平、安全与自由的愿望。决议要求印度政府立即对美国总统说，印度人民一致反对美国的战争政策。决议要求印度政府在目前的联合国会议上提出关于立即在朝鲜停火的提案。西孟加拉省立法会议议员阿马尔·鲍斯在会上说：印度人民必须和苏联与中国站在一起，以避免美国对印度的愈来愈大的威胁。他说，如果美帝国主义对中国或苏联发动战争，每一个印度人一定站在苏联和中国一边。全印总工会孟加拉省分会的本诺伊·查特吉在会上强调说：西孟加拉工人决不参加任何为帝国主义的利益服务的战争。名作家蒙诺志·鲍斯在谈到他最近访问中国的观感时说：中国人民把印度代表当作和平代表来欢迎。印度代表受到的荣誉必须保持。我们应当采取步骤，使帝国主义者不敢对中国发动侵略。
    在西孟加拉各地，“制止艾森豪威尔行动日”的活动进行得非常热烈。目前在西孟加拉各地举行的农民会议在通过关于农民的要求的决议的同时，还通过决议，反对艾森豪威尔的制造战争的政策。在“我们不要战争，我们要和平”、“打倒帝国主义的制造战争的政策”、“立刻在朝鲜停火”和“不许干涉中国”的口号下，西孟加拉各个地方纷纷举行集会和游行。
    在印度极东部的阿萨姆和特里波拉，这一天曾举行公众集会，保证推进和平运动，并加强保卫世界和平的斗争。
    在比哈尔的工业中心亚姆雪普尔，当地的和平委员会、文化协会、妇女福利协会和民主青年联合会在这一天联合举行公众集会。会上通过决议，要求印度政府设法防止朝鲜战争扩大，在朝鲜实行无条件停火，缔结五大国和平公约。
    在德里以东三十哩的一个重要铁路交叉点——加齐亚巴德，当地的和平委员会这一天在当地市政厅举行公众集会，集会由杰格迪希·钱德拉博士担任主席。在会上发言的有印地语日报“新印度报”主笔哈里·杜特和雅·杜·夏尔马。在江普拉（在德里郊外）举行的集会通过决议，要求印度政府尊重印度人民的愿望，促使美国签订五大国和平公约。印度共产党中央委员会委员雅·杜·夏尔马在会上说：全世界爱好和平的人民将粉碎美国战争贩子所奉行的用亚洲人打亚洲人的战争阴谋。印度国会议员查图尔·纳拉茵·马拉维亚说：中国人民希望和印度人民友好相处。他说，根据他在中国所看到的情况，他确信美国曾进行过细菌战。他斥责最近艾森豪威尔所宣布的关于台湾的措施，他说，全世界爱好和平的人民将反对和粉碎这种侵略阴谋。
    东旁遮普省各地——朱龙多、卢德希那、弗罗吉波尔县的摩加、切纳尔塔（阿姆利则郊外工业区）以及其他城市和村庄——都举行了“制止艾森豪威尔行动日”。
    在中央省，那格浦尔地方这一天曾举行公众集会。中央省立法会议议员塔库尔·皮亚雷拉尔·辛格在会上说：人民应当清楚地认识，现任美国总统竭力想把全世界拖进第三次世界大战，并统治亚洲人，办法是使他们自相残杀。因此他要求人民反对战争，抵制美国的货物。
    在海得拉巴市，当地和平委员会在这一天举行公众集会。集会由前任海得拉巴首席法官纳齐尔·雅尔·詹格担任主席。会议通过决议，要求印度政府警告美国政府，任何企图进攻中国的行动都将被认为是美国的侵略。集会发表呼吁书，号召人民尽一切力量粉碎艾森豪威尔的危险计划，要求立即结束朝鲜战争，缔结五大国公约。在这一天，海得拉巴邦的各个城市和村庄也都曾举行类似的集会。
    【新华社新德里十七日电】印度马德拉斯省人民从三月七日到十五日举行“制止艾森豪威尔行动周”。在这一周中，马德拉斯省和平委员会组织了各种集会，要求在朝鲜实现停火，反对帝国主义者在马来亚和越南进行的战争。
    马德拉斯省和平委员会在号召举行“制止艾森豪威尔行动周”的声明中说，马德拉斯人民和全印度人民一道反对艾森豪威尔的战争政策。声明中说：
    “正当全世界爱好和平的人民怀着焦虑的心情盼望停止朝鲜的屠杀和敌对行动的时候，艾森豪威尔总统却在一项关于中国和远东的政策声明中明目张胆地表明他想在远东扩大战争的意图。”声明接着说：战争的扩大“将给千百万人民带来死亡和无法形容的苦难，尤其是在亚洲。就印度而言，战争的扩大将不仅给我们的经济造成极大的困难，而且将直接威胁我们祖国的安全和主权本身。”
    声明指出：“在艾克的政策的背后，是用亚洲人打亚洲人的一种恶毒的计划。美国怀着这个目的，正在重新武装日本和台湾，把它们实际变为兵营。美国唯一的目的是想叫亚洲人跟他们自己的兄弟互相残杀。我们还记得很清楚，美国把亚洲人当作豚鼠来试验原子弹和细菌弹的效果。”
    声明说：“在这样的战争威胁下，所有亚洲人民的任务就是团结起来，组成坚强的和平阵线，来反对艾克的战争目的。”
