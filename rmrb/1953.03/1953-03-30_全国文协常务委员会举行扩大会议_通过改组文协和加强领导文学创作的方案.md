    National Literature Association Standing Committee Holds Enlarged Meeting
    Passes Plan to Reorganize the Literature Association and Strengthen Leadership of Literary Creation
    The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Literary Workers held its sixth enlarged meeting in Beijing on the 24th, and passed the "Work Plan on Reorganizing the National Literature Association and Strengthening Leadership of Literary Creation," and resolved to establish a Creation Committee to be responsible for leading national literary creation.
    The meeting was presided over by Mao Dun, Chairman of the National Literature Association. Those present included Zhou Yang, Shao Quanlin, Feng Xuefeng, Lao She, Zhao Shuli, Cao Jinghua, Zhang Tianyi, Feng Zhi, Yu Pingbo, Huang Yaomian, Zhong Jingwen, Hu Feng, Song Zhi's, Chen Huangmei, Yan Wenjing, Wang Yaping, Chen Qixia, Yuan Shuipai, Ye Yiqun, Jiang Muliang, Ke Lan and more than twenty others.
    After Yan Wenjing, Acting Secretary-General of the National Literature Association, reported on the main work of the National Literature Association in the past four months, the meeting held a full discussion on how to make the National Literature Association a truly unified and combative organization that leads national literary creation in name and in fact. The meeting held that many writers with creative ability and experience are either holding administrative positions and unable to engage in creation, or are scattered in various literary and art units and unable to regularly obtain strong leadership. This situation seriously hinders the development of creative work. Our country has entered a new historical stage of large-scale economic construction, and the broad masses of people require writers to conscientiously follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and to create works with high ideological content and artistic skill using the creative method of socialist realism. Therefore, the National Literature Association must be reorganized in accordance with the spirit of the rectification of literary and art circles, and earnestly take on the tasks of leading writers' creation, criticism, study, and popularization.
    Based on these requirements, the meeting decided to establish a Creation Committee under the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the National Literature Association as an agency for specifically guiding literary creation activities. The Creation Committee will organize writers in Beijing into creation groups according to their wishes, such as novels and essays, scripts, poetry, film literature, children's literature, popular literature, etc., to help writers formulate and realize their creative plans, conduct regular discussions on works and creative issues, and conduct Marxist-Leninist political and artistic study. The creation groups will also absorb young literary workers with writing talents who are not members to cultivate them. At the meeting, Ding Ling, Lao She, Feng Xuefeng, Cao Yu, Zhang Tianyi, Shao Quanlin, Sha Ting, Chen Huangmei, Yuan Shuipai, Chen Baichen, and Yan Wenjing were elected as members of the Creation Committee, and Shao Quanlin was appointed as director and Sha Ting as deputy director.
    The meeting decided to establish a Publication Committee under the Standing Committee to be responsible for studying the principles and plans of the publications of the National Literature Association and inspecting their implementation. The National Literature Association will use "People's Literature" as a publication for publishing creative works. The meeting also decided to consult with the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to transfer "Literary and Art Gazette" to the leadership of the National Literature Association as a theoretical and critical publication of literary and art; the National Literature Association will take over "New Observer" as a literary and artistic political commentary and essay publication; the National Literature Association will prepare to publish "Translations" as a publication introducing world progressive literature; and the National Literature Association should strengthen its leadership over the popular literary and art publication "Talks and Ballads." At the meeting, Feng Xuefeng, Sha Ting, Chen Qixia, Wang Yaping, Chen Bingyi, and Ge Yang were elected as members of the Publication Committee, and Feng Xuefeng was appointed as director.
    Combining the above discussions, the meeting passed the "Work Plan on Reorganizing the National Literature Association and Strengthening Leadership of Literary Creation."
    The meeting also carried out the following agenda: discussed and passed the report of the membership reorganization group on the work of reorganizing membership; resolved to suggest that the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government transfer the teaching and research business of the Central Institute of Literature to the leadership of the National Literature Association; appointed Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Hong Shen, Cao Jinghua, Ge Baoquan, Feng Zhi, Dong Qiusi, Jiang Chunfang, Zhang Tiexian, Ye Shuifu, Xiao Qian, Chen Bingyi and other twelve people as members of the editorial committee of "Translations" magazine, with Mao Dun as editor-in-chief; elected Yan Wenjing as Secretary-General of the National Literature Association; resolved to solicit the opinions of all members of the National Committee of the National Literature Association in the near future, and convene a national members' representative conference this year to combine the study of the creative method of socialist realism, discuss current issues in literary creation ideology, and revise the constitution and reorganize the National Literature Association.
    Finally, the meeting also resolved to respond to the "Declaration of Writers Attending the World People's Peace Congress" and called on writers across the country to participate in the world people's movement to defend peace with practical actions. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国文协常务委员会举行扩大会议
    通过改组文协和加强领导文学创作的方案
    中华全国文学工作者协会全国委员会常务委员会二十四日在北京召开第六次扩大会议，通过了“关于改组全国文协和加强领导文学创作的工作方案”，并决议成立创作委员会负责领导全国文学创作。
    会议由全国文协主席茅盾主持，出席的有周扬、邵荃麟、冯雪峰、老舍、赵树理、曹靖华、张天翼、冯至、俞平伯、黄药眠、锺敬文、胡风、宋之的、陈荒煤、严文井、王亚平、陈企霞、袁水拍、叶以群、蒋牧良、柯蓝等二十多人。
    会议在全国文协代理秘书长严文井报告了全国文协最近四个多月的主要工作之后，对如何使全国文协成为真正名符其实的领导全国文学创作的统一的战斗的团体这一问题，进行了充分的讨论。会议认为：目前许多具有创作能力和经验的作家或者担任了行政工作，不能从事创作；或者分散在各文艺单位，不能经常获得强有力的领导。这种情况严重地妨碍了创作工作的发展。而我们的国家已进入大规模经济建设的新的历史阶段，广大人民要求作家切实地遵照毛主席的指示，以社会主义现实主义的创作方法创造出具有高度思想内容和艺术技巧的作品。因此，全国文协必须根据文艺整风的精神加以改组，认真地担负起领导作家的创作、批评、学习等活动以及指导普及的任务。
    根据这样的要求，会议决定在全国文协全国委员会常务委员会下设立一个创作委员会，作为具体指导文学创作活动的机构。创作委员会将在北京的作家按志愿编为小说散文、剧本、诗歌、电影文学、儿童文学、通俗文学等创作组，分别帮助作家订立和实现其创作计划，进行关于作品和创作问题的经常讨论，进行马克思列宁主义的政治和艺术的学习。创作组并吸收非会员的有写作才能的青年文学工作者参加，对他们进行培养。会议上选出丁玲、老舍、冯雪峰、曹禺、张天翼、邵荃麟、沙汀、陈荒煤、袁水拍、陈白尘、严文井等十一人为创作委员会委员，并推定邵荃麟为主任，沙汀为副主任。
    会议决定在常务委员会下设立一个刊物委员会，负责研究全国文协各机关刊物的方针、计划，并检查其执行情况。全国文协以“人民文学”作为发表创作的刊物。会议并决定：商请中华全国文学艺术界联合会将“文艺报”划归全国文协领导，作为文学艺术的理论批评刊物；全国文协接办“新观察”，作为文艺性的政论和小品散文刊物；全国文协筹备出版“译文”，作为介绍世界进步文学的刊物；全国文协并应加强对通俗文艺刊物“说说唱唱”的领导。会议上选出了冯雪峰、沙汀、陈企霞、王亚平、陈冰夷、戈扬等六人为刊物委员会的委员，并推定冯雪峰为主任。
    综合上述的讨论，会议通过了“关于改组全国文协和加强领导文学创作的工作方案”。
    会议还进行了下列的议程：讨论和通过了会员整理小组关于整理会员工作的报告；决议建议中央人民政府文化部将中央文学研究所的教学和研究业务划归全国文协领导；推定茅盾、周扬、洪深、曹靖华、戈宝权、冯至、董秋斯、姜椿芳、张铁弦、叶水夫、萧乾、陈冰夷等十二人为“译文”杂志编辑委员会委员，茅盾为主编；选出严文井为全国文协秘书长；决议最近征求全国文协全国委员会各委员的意见，在今年召开一次全国会员代表大会，以结合对社会主义现实主义的创作方法的学习，讨论当前文学创作思想问题，并修改会章、改组全国文协。
    会议最后还决议响应“出席世界人民和平大会作家们的宣言”，号召全国作家以实际行动参加世界人民保卫和平运动。（新华社）
