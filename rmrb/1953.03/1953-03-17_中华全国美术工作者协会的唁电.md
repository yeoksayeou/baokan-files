Condolences from the All-China Federation of Art Workers to the Czechoslovakian Fine Arts Association:

    We were shocked to hear of the sudden death of Comrade Gottwald, and on behalf of all Chinese art workers, we express our deepest condolences. We believe that the people in the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will unite even more closely, redouble their efforts, heighten their vigilance, and strive for new victories in the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.
                        All-China Federation of Art Workers
                      March 15, 1953, Beijing
